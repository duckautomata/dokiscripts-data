1
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,880
Oh my god.

2
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:54,860
This game.

3
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,340
I also need to remember not to swear.

4
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,600
The first 10 minutes.

5
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,700
Oh my god.

6
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:14,180
Just so you guys know, if you don't follow me on Twitter, My bunny garden video, it got hit.

7
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,780
It 100% got hit.

8
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,140
And then I had to peel it.

9
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,200
And then they got it.

10
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,760
And then they...

11
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:29,260
And then they like... It's monetizable again.

12
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,520
It was limited.

13
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,600
And then I was like, no.

14
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,720
I swear.

15
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,860
This is advertiser friendly.

16
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,280
Please.

17
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,540
Please review my stream.

18
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,500
I swear.

19
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,160
I honestly thought it was a good stream.

20
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,260
I thought they were not going to appeal it.

21
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,760
Because they were going to rewatch the stream.

22
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,080
And they were going to be like, oh wait.

23
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,660
We made the right decision.

24
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,040
Because of the actual contents of the stream.

25
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,120
But then I peeled it.

26
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,180
And then a couple of hours later, they were like, yep.

27
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,900
You're right.

28
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,460
It is advertiser friendly.

29
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,980
I was like, yay.

30
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,000
Nice to know that profanity is where they draw the line.

31
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,800
It's nice to know that.

32
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,940
Not anything else in the stream.

33
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,920
But the profanity is where we draw the line.

34
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,840
John, you found a box full of caps.

35
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,300
Thank you for the super chat.

36
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:24,680
Thank you.

37
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,340
Thank you.

38
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,700
Oh my gosh.

39
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:27,540
Anyway.

40
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,920
Okay, let me... Okay.

41
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:30,780
This game.

42
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:32,980
Okay.

43
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,860
So I was googling the problems.

44
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:35,620
I know.

45
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:39,220
I like how some of you guys are like, Doki, don't you test games before your stream?

46
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,060
Look.

47
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,420
Usually, yes.

48
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:46,120
But when it's... When it's a stream that's at 1230, no.

49
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:57,930
Any stream that is like at 1230, that is like, you know, I would usually be awake at 1220.

50
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:02,010
I would usually be awake at 1220.

51
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:06,270
So you would expect me not to test anything by then.

52
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:07,750
.

53
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:17,090
No stream at 12... No game at 1230 is gonna get tested before stream.

54
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,550
We do it live.

55
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,990
We like pray that like everything will be okay.

56
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:25,830
And there will be no troubles, no issues whatsoever.

57
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:31,390
But every time... Every time I'm always hopeful that today would be different.

58
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,190
Today was not different.

59
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:33,990
.

60
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:36,850
One day.

61
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,410
One day!

62
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,110
I... Okay.

63
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:44,150
To be fair, it's only if it's like not like... If it's a game that I've never played before.

64
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:52,950
But one day, a game that I've never played before is going to run perfectly at 1230.

65
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,430
One day!

66
00:04:58,890 --> 00:04:59,470
Okay.

67
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:03,230
Anyway, here is another issue that I ran into.

68
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:05,050
So...

69
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:08,750
So I was freaking out in chat because I was like...

70
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,730
I booted up the game and it was a black screen.

71
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:14,110
Which just like... I hear the music and everything.

72
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,610
And I was like, wait, what?

73
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,270
What's going on?

74
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:21,290
And then... So like I was freaking out because I was like, oh no, not another technical.

75
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:24,090
Why is it always 1230 when we have technical issues?

76
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:30,430
Why is every game I play at 1230 we encounter something?

77
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:33,610
And then so I googled it and it's so weird.

78
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,390
It's like... Apparently it's a really common issue.

79
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,130
Thank you, Todd.

80
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,410
We love your games.

81
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,470
You don't understand, guys.

82
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,270
Sorry, not an issue.

83
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,170
An experience.

84
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,970
According to Mr. Todd Howard himself.

85
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:52,770
Every bug and glitch is an experience.

86
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,510
Into the world of Bethesda games.

87
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,950
Anyway, so I googled it and then it was like...

88
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,150
Oh, you have to go to the documents?

89
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,030
And then you have to go to my games?

90
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,610
And then you have to go to Fallout 76?

91
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:09,010
And you have to click the Fallout preference?

92
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:16,450
And then you have to go look at this exact game feature in the preference in the notepad?

93
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,010
And you have to put it at zero?

94
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,610
So I was like, oh, okay.

95
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:25,170
I did all that and I edited the document, the notepad document, and I put it at zero.

96
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,150
Put it up.

97
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:26,830
It's great.

98
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,410
And then suddenly...

99
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,850
And then suddenly it was like...

100
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:31,450
Oh.

101
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:35,090
You gotta create a Bethesda account.

102
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,050
And I was like, okay.

103
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:40,570
So then I was like, okay, type in your email and your username.

104
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:41,950
I was like, okay.

105
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,290
And then I looked at the bottom.

106
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,510
AYX.

107
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,790
I was like, wait.

108
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:50,190
Not okay.

109
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,430
So...

110
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,370
So I was like, wait.

111
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:04,450
Why is it controller button?

112
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:07,970
And then...

113
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:12,070
I plugged in my controller.

114
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,490
I plugged in my controller.

115
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,170
And I was like, okay.

116
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,210
A.

117
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,090
Put it to work.

118
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,810
I was like, huh?

119
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,150
Wait.

120
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:27,470
What do you mean?

121
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,450
And I was like, okay.

122
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,530
A.

123
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,070
A.

124
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:33,230
A.

125
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,910
I was like, oh no.

126
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:40,770
So...

127
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:43,170
So...

128
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:43,750
So...

129
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:43,830
So...

130
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,010
So...

131
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:45,510
I had to Google that as well.

132
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:46,930
I was like, controller.

133
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,890
Forced controller on Fallout 76.

134
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,750
And then they're like, oh yeah.

135
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,610
You have to go to...

136
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,670
You have to go to my documents.

137
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:59,670
And then my game in Fallout 76.

138
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:03,730
And then change controller to zero.

139
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,730
So like, as in like, not forced controller.

140
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,850
I was like, oh.

141
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:09,830
Okay.

142
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,170
But then like...

143
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:19,930
But then the thing is...

144
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:20,990
The thing is...

145
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,890
Before all that...

146
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:27,110
I was like, try to like, make my own solution.

147
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:28,330
Like force...

148
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:29,850
I just brute force my own solution.

149
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:35,090
Because you can disable controller input on Steam.

150
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,250
So I did that.

151
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:39,890
And I disabled controller input on Steam.

152
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:40,930
And everything.

153
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:45,070
And I was like, does this work?

154
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:46,510
And then I looked below.

155
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,930
A, Y, Z... oh wait not A, Y, Z.

156
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:49,790
A, Y, X.

157
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,550
I was like, oh...

158
00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:01,150
I just... guys, I'm having a great time with Fallout 76 already.

159
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:07,370
I'm already modding the game before we even played the game.

160
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:13,430
I already have to like mod the game just to force myself to be able to play the game.

161
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:17,410
Also, by the way, I went to bed at like...

162
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:18,310
Okay guys.

163
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,470
There was another reason why I was EP.

164
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,830
I have a problem.

165
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:28,630
Before I tell you guys what I mean by I have a problem.

166
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,930
Please don't judge me.

167
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:32,790
Guys, okay.

168
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:36,390
If you guys promise me you won't judge me.

169
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:40,010
I will tell you the reason why I have a problem.

170
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:42,990
But... but...

171
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:48,490
I have to make sure that people say I'll never judge you Doki because you're perfect.

172
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,530
And anything that I say.

173
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,810
Anything that seems unperfect.

174
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,130
Is just...

175
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,510
Is just a lie.

176
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:57,990
You're perfect, my queen.

177
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:03,030
I need someone to type exactly what I said.

178
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:03,870
There.

179
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,750
And then I'll tell you the story.

180
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,410
I need at least one person to type it fully.

181
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:15,130
Wow!

182
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,790
I'll never judge you because you're perfect, my queen.

183
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,190
Oh my god.

184
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,850
Look at all these very natural responses.

185
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,630
Oh my...

186
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:28,310
Oh my god.

187
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:32,090
I can't believe all of you guys would say something very similar.

188
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,450
All at once.

189
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:34,350
Oh my...

190
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,790
I'll never judge you, my queen.

191
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:37,670
What does LIE mean?

192
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,690
Many thank you for the super chat.

193
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:40,190
Thank you.

194
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:40,770
Thank you.

195
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:41,730
All right.

196
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:42,370
Okay.

197
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,150
Guys.

198
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,030
Okay.

199
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:52,450
So the reason why is that I went to bed at like 7 a.m.

200
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:52,830
And I was like, I'm going to bed.

201
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,470
Because I was playing Overwatch rank.

202
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:00,490
Okay.

203
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:02,430
Look.

204
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,550
I have...

205
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,190
Guys.

206
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:04,790
Look.

207
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,710
I have a perfect, reasonable explanation.

208
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:07,750
Chat.

209
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:13,210
I haven't touched Overwatch 2 rank like actually seriously for a while now.

210
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:18,770
Then there are moments when you're playing a competitive multiplayer FPS games.

211
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:21,330
And then you hit that moment.

212
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,810
You hit...

213
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:27,130
You hit that moment where you couldn't stop playing.

214
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:33,770
And unfortunately, I was like messing about on like Overwatch 2 rank.

215
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,910
And then I hit that moment.

216
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,190
Because like I was doing...

217
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,730
I was doing like placements.

218
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:43,790
And then like I got like D1.

219
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:48,310
And then I was like I want to be masters on this account.

220
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:51,090
And then I hit that moment.

221
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:51,310
And then I hit that moment.

222
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,070
And then I played...

223
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:54,230
I played...

224
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,590
Played for like...

225
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,630
The most fucked up part was I was doing late night queues.

226
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:00,970
That was like the most fucked up part.

227
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:04,590
Because late night queues are the worst that you never climb on.

228
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:06,690
But then I was like I'm different.

229
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,010
I was like no.

230
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,190
I'm different.

231
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:16,230
There's no...

232
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,590
Late night queues are nothing to me.

233
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,050
I'll be different.

234
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:20,810
I'll be different.

235
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:25,470
I'm different.

236
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,270
So.

237
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:28,690
So the thing is...

238
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:32,490
The thing is...

239
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,530
The thing is...

240
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:34,090
I hit...

241
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,710
I hit masters.

242
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,650
But another thing is...

243
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,790
Another thing is...

244
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:41,350
Another thing is...

245
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,970
You don't stop when you're on a streak.

246
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,730
But then...

247
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,390
The thing is...

248
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,290
The thing is...

249
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:56,110
And now, after 5 plus hours of playing, I am not masters anymore.

250
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:07,380
And then... so, this is how it goes usually.

251
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,440
You're like, oh I'm gonna get it.

252
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:16,500
You get it and you're like, I don't wanna end the streak because I'm lucky right now.

253
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,820
And then you start losing.

254
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,380
And then you're like, I'm not gonna end on a loss.

255
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,600
And then you keep losing.

256
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,440
And then you're like, I'm not gonna end on a loss streak.

257
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,280
And then you win a game.

258
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,640
And then you're like, oh...

259
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,180
This is where I hit my win streak.

260
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,120
I might as well keep going.

261
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,880
Because I might be able to get back my masters.

262
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,800
And then you still keep losing.

263
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,580
And then you're like, well, obviously I can't end on a loss.

264
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,380
Okay, to be fair...

265
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,940
I would have been okay...

266
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:54,940
If it wasn't for one game that boosted my ego so fucking hard.

267
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:04,940
Like... I had one game where my ego got boosted so fucking hard...

268
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,640
That I was like, I'm gonna keep going.

269
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,020
Because obviously I'm a fucking insane player.

270
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,400
That I deserve to be top 500.

271
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,860
And...

272
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,020
I don't know.

273
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,720
I'm into cap.

274
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Johnathan Perry.

275
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:19,600
Thank you.

276
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:19,960
Thank you.

277
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,480
Super Chat.

278
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,500
Thank you, thank you!

279
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,200
Look!

280
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,040
Look!

281
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,000
I blame Bunny Gaiden.

282
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,440
It triggered something inside of me.

283
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,640
I blame...

284
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,140
But the thing is...

285
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:34,380
During the moment in those late night queues...

286
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:39,000
There was a moment where I acce- I don't know how...

287
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,860
But I got into a game...

288
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,420
The rank-range was...

289
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,000
Diamond one?

290
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,560
1 to GM... Grandmaster 2.

291
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:54,020
And then everyone in my lobby was like, what the fuck?

292
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,920
Like, what is this range?

293
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,660
And like, who is the Diamond 1 player?

294
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,920
I was the Diamond 1 player.

295
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:10,560
I didn't say anything because I didn't want people to yell at me if we lose.

296
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:15,140
But people in the game were like, who the fuck is the Diamond player?

297
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,520
In this lobby.

298
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,300
Because that lobby...

299
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,700
I was actually the only Diamond 1 player.

300
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,460
I was the only Diamond player in that lobby.

301
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,400
But the thing was...

302
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:34,380
That lobby was filled with actual Overwatch League players.

303
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,540
At late night queues, by the way.

304
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,480
At late night queues.

305
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:43,320
There was like Overwatch League players on the enemy team.

306
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,120
And then my team had like 1 or 2 players.

307
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,860
And then I had like 1 or 2 players from the ex-rank 1 DPS player on my team.

308
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:52,660
Like the person who used to be rank 1 DPS player.

309
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,300
And then I was like, oh no.

310
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,160
Oh no.

311
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,160
Oh no.

312
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,160
Oh no.

313
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,120
Oh no.

314
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,340
So the thing was...

315
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,020
The thing was...

316
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,140
At the end of the game...

317
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,680
People were like...

318
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,840
One of my teammates was calling out the enemy Ana's player.

319
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:15,120
One of my teammates was calling out the enemy Ana's player.

320
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,500
The enemy Ana player.

321
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,740
And was like, are you the Diamond player, Ana?

322
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,480
And then the Ana player on the enemy team was like...

323
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,740
No I'm Master 4.

324
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,400
And then I was like...

325
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,260
Because we were winning.

326
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,640
Because we were winning...

327
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,000
I was like...

328
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,960
I'm the Diamond 1 player.

329
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,080
And so they were like...

330
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,180
And then my teammates were like...

331
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,020
Wait, no serious?

332
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:41,840
No shit?

333
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,420
I was like...

334
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:47,060
I didn't use my voice because I was also scared they were going to be like women.

335
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,420
But all of a sudden I was like...

336
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,000
I was like...

337
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,920
Yeah...

338
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,280
I'm serious.

339
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,580
And they were like...

340
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,340
And they were like...

341
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,060
Oh my god you're actually really good.

342
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,780
And then one person on my team was like...

343
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,720
You have been...

344
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,220
Who was like...

345
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,400
You're better than all the supports I've had today.

346
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,600
Like no lie.

347
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:10,480
I'm serious.

348
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,600
And then I was like...

349
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,760
I'm serious.

350
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,420
And then he sent me a friend request.

351
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,540
And I was like...

352
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,460
Oh my god.

353
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,240
Maybe I do deserve to be in top 5.

354
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,740
I was like...

355
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,240
I've been losing...

356
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,100
I have a very bad win-loss ratio right now.

357
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,600
But it is definitely my teammates.

358
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,040
And it is not me.

359
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,960
And it is not me.

360
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,840
I was like...

361
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,060
Oh my god.

362
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,680
Now I know for sure.

363
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,540
It's not me.

364
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,000
It's my teammates.

365
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,140
I gotta keep going.

366
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,700
I gotta keep playing.

367
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,260
Cause now I know for sure it's not me.

368
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:57,420
I could have stopped so much earlier.

369
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,500
But that moment...

370
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,160
That moment I was like...

371
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,140
Oh my god.

372
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,520
I need to keep going.

373
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,620
Eventually I'll get the cash out.

374
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,880
Eventually I'll get the cash out.

375
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,560
Cause like...

376
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,840
It wasn't just that person.

377
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,740
Like multiple people on my team were like...

378
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,800
You're the diamond player?

379
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,880
Bro you don't deserve to be in that rank.

380
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,380
I was like... Oh my god.

381
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:19,680
Really?

382
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,680
And one guy was like...

383
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,100
You know like those people...

384
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,520
You know those people that were like...

385
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,960
I don't deserve to be in diamond.

386
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,280
I'm like clearly better than my rank.

387
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,420
That's actually you.

388
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,320
You could take this gameplay and make a video.

389
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,200
Where it was like... I deserve to be top 500.

390
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,660
And I was like... Me?

391
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:41,700
Hahahaha Hahahaha Like I was like...

392
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,400
You could take this video and actually like...

393
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,360
Make it into some fucking highlight.

394
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,160
To be like...

395
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,980
I deserve to be top 500.

396
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,680
I don't deserve to be in diamond.

397
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,860
And I'm serious.

398
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,480
And you're like one of those people that actually deserve that.

399
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,380
I was like... Oh my god.

400
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,420
Me?

401
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:58,860
Hahahaha

402
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,420
It was multiple.

403
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,920
It was like three different people were like...

404
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,480
Yeah you are not a diamond one player.

405
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,500
You're actually pretty good.

406
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,640
I'm like... Oh my god.

407
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,860
I'm actually pretty good.

408
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,200
Hahahaha Hahahaha Alright.

409
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,700
Yeah so...

410
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,160
So...

411
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,460
Ummm...

412
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,200
So that is why...

413
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,260
I had a problem last night.

414
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,300
I had a huge issue last night.

415
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,600
Because if it wasn't for those people...

416
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,660
For gassing me up.

417
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,440
I would have cashed out early.

418
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,720
No it's not me.

419
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,800
I was not the problem.

420
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,740
And I kept going.

421
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,920
But then at one point I was like...

422
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,720
Maybe...

423
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,780
And then at one...

424
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,560
No it was never my problem.

425
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,040
But thing is...

426
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:52,620
I realized late night queues was never like the answer.

427
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,920
It was never...

428
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,740
Never played late night queues.

429
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:58,840
Because...

430
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,720
Because it is definitely an issue.

431
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,000
And I feel like that was why I was losing.

432
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,060
Not because of me.

433
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:05,500
Obviously.

434
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,960
But it was never my problem.

435
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:10,300
But because late night queues was a huge problem.

436
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:14,980
Hahahaha Hahahaha Okay here.

437
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:15,720
Here look.

438
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:19,820
See you are like 10 times better than all my support players today.

439
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,140
Well played.

440
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,080
You are the GOAT.

441
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,660
That was my highlight.

442
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,840
Hahahaha And then...

443
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,380
The thing was...

444
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,140
I took a screenshot of fucking course.

445
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,440
I needed the ego boost guys.

446
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,120
Like...

447
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,420
I needed the ego boost.

448
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,740
I took more than just one screenshot.

449
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,860
There was more behind.

450
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,880
But like I am too embarrassed to show the other screenshots.

451
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,760
But to show the other screenshots they were saying.

452
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:50,760
Because...

453
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,840
But this one I took.

454
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:52,900
Anyway...

455
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:54,920
Anyway...

456
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,780
That was my highlight.

457
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,380
Okay not only did I take screenshots.

458
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,220
But there were streamers in my game as well.

459
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,880
But the thing is...

460
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:04,920
They put sub...

461
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,740
I wanted to clip that moment.

462
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,520
To be like whenever I feel down.

463
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,500
And wonder is it me.

464
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,420
I can look at that clip.

465
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,580
And be like it was not me.

466
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:23,360
Hahahaha Hahahaha Hahahaha But the thing is...

467
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,740
The VODs.

468
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,760
All the streamers that were streaming that game.

469
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,180
The VODs were sub only mode.

470
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:32,820
The VODs were sub only mode.

471
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,280
And I was like.

472
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:34,660
Am I that desperate?

473
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,960
Am I that desperate to use my Twitch Prime.

474
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,080
On one of these streamers.

475
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,040
Just so I can like...

476
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,500
Clip that one moment.

477
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,060
And be like I still got it.

478
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:46,980
Hahahaha.

479
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:48,880
Hahahaha.

480
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,200
I was like...

481
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,680
Do I...

482
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,620
Bro I am not going to pay it.

483
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,820
I am not going to use actual money.

484
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,620
I was going to use my Twitch Prime.

485
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,960
Anyway you guys don't know what Twitch Prime is.

486
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,100
It's basically.

487
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,740
If you have Amazon Prime.

488
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,480
And you linked it on your Twitch account.

489
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,680
You can subscribe to your favorite streamer.

490
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,140
I.e.

491
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:10,380
me.

492
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,960
At Doki Bird at Twitch.

493
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,840
So why don't you throw your Twitch Prime at Doki Bird.

494
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,380
So why don't you throw your Twitch Prime at Doki Bird.

495
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,000
But yeah.

496
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,660
I was like no.

497
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,720
Don't use your Twitch Prime.

498
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,240
Just for that one game.

499
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,280
That one moment in your life.

500
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,560
When all these top 500 players.

501
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:32,920
Were like.

502
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:33,840
Wow.

503
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,400
You don't deserve to be in that elo.

504
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,220
You truly.

505
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,480
Hahahaha.

506
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,560
Because before then.

507
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,840
I was always.

508
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,560
I was like.

509
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,180
Do I actually deserve to be in Diamond?

510
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,880
Or anything.

511
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,080
Is it me?

512
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,440
But now I know.

513
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,080
It was never me.

514
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:57,480
It was never me.

515
00:22:59,340 --> 00:22:59,780
So.

516
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,120
And that is why.

517
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,680
I slept at 7 in the morning today.

518
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,360
Because of that one fateful game.

519
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,780
That kept me going.

520
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:08,860
What I kept.

521
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,780
Fiction thank you for the super chat.

522
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,120
Thank you.

523
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,820
Don't do what I did.

524
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,980
And play competitive constantly.

525
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,960
To the point you make the lives of people around you living hell.

526
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,900
And punch a hole in your wall.

527
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:21,800
Holy fuck.

528
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:22,600
Thank you for the super chat.

529
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:22,900
Thank you.

530
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,700
I cried.

531
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,220
Because I lost top 500.

532
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,240
I think it was for Overwatch.

533
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:34,980
No.

534
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,640
It was for both Apex and Overwatch.

535
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,040
I cried because I had very unlucky games.

536
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,120
And I was so close to top 500.

537
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,380
But then I had some series of very unlucky games.

538
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,440
And I didn't destroy a mouse.

539
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,360
Not because of anger.

540
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,380
It's not because of anger.

541
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,820
That I destroyed a mouse.

542
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,440
It's because I was playing.

543
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:55,860
Okay.

544
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,940
For those who don't know the story.

545
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,000
At one point Mercy was meta.

546
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,180
And I really hated playing Mercy.

547
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:08,180
Because I was one of those players that tried to avoid Mercy.

548
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:13,460
Because the moment you play Mercy in a game.

549
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,080
And you open your voice.

550
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:16,880
People will be like.

551
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,200
Typical Mercy main.

552
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,000
So I made it my damn hardest.

553
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,680
To never play Mercy.

554
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,720
Because I was so mad.

555
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,260
Whenever people would be like.

556
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,160
Typical Mercy one trick.

557
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,400
So that I made.

558
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,440
My damn hardest.

559
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,920
To never pick that character.

560
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,820
But then Mercy became meta.

561
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,860
So I had no excuse.

562
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,080
Because it's like.

563
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,280
I think it was Mercy and Zenyatta.

564
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,620
Were most meta.

565
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,740
And I didn't really want to play Zenyatta.

566
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,520
Because at that time.

567
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,660
It was like hard dive.

568
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,020
And I was like.

569
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,240
I'm not playing Zenyatta.

570
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,780
In hard dive.

571
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,740
I was like.

572
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,180
That sounds fucking miserable.

573
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,860
So I played Mercy for the meta.

574
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,260
And so like.

575
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,400
Because of that.

576
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,160
I was gripping my mouse.

577
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,520
So fucking hard.

578
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,340
That like the left mouse button broke off.

579
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:18,800
And like.

580
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,980
And the side grips also.

581
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,420
Peeled off.

582
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,140
The side grip.

583
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,340
Because it's like the tape thing on the back.

584
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,140
Of the side grip.

585
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,040
And then the left mouse button.

586
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,620
Fucking snapped off.

587
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:35,480
And like I had a photo of it a long time ago.

588
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,660
I need to like dig it up.

589
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,620
But like yeah.

590
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,840
That was the first time I ever broke my mouse.

591
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,160
From playing Mercy.

592
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,400
It was the first and only time.

593
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,500
I've ever broke my mouse.

594
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,800
Anyway guys.

595
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,080
It's been 26 minutes.

596
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,880
And we still haven't played the game.

597
00:25:59,260 --> 00:25:59,560
So...

598
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,560
So...

599
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,120
So...

600
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:07,180
So...

601
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:07,780
So here we are.

602
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,500
Let's actually.

603
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,700
Did you?

604
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,660
I don't know guys.

605
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,340
It was like 6 plus years ago.

606
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:17,020
It was Overwatch 1.

607
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,900
But okay.

608
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:19,960
Game.

609
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,000
Wait what?

610
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:22,780
Tab.

611
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:23,920
Oh wait.

612
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,280
Oh I was like.

613
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:25,780
What?

614
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,200
Okay.

615
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:26,720
Play.

616
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,320
World found.

617
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,300
Alright we're actually gonna play the.

618
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,560
I can actually finally play the game.

619
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,800
Sorry for everybody that was waiting for a very long time.

620
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,180
So the reason why I'm playing.

621
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,840
Fallout 76.

622
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,040
I talked about this before.

623
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,880
But I recently watched.

624
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:42,220
Fallout.

625
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,440
The show.

626
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,420
I honestly really like it.

627
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,440
But I am.

628
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,100
To be fair.

629
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,680
I am more so like.

630
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,380
I haven't actually played any of the games.

631
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,060
I watched my dad play Fallout 4.

632
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,220
But I never actually played the games myself.

633
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,380
But I did do.

634
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,340
I did do a deep dive.

635
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,300
Of the Fallout lore in the wikis.

636
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,940
Where like you look at one thing.

637
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,200
And then you go through so many other things.

638
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,820
Within the Fallout lore.

639
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,140
Because you want to look at the vaults.

640
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,260
And then you look at everything else.

641
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,740
Also by the way.

642
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,780
Let me know if the sound is okay.

643
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,380
Because I don't know if the sound guy is here.

644
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:19,520
So today is one of those rare days that I let the chat.

645
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,380
Figure out if the sound is okay.

646
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,620
Because I don't know if any of my mods are awake today.

647
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,440
Because I don't know if any of my mods are awake today.

648
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:37,320
Okay I am going to make the volume a little higher.

649
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,520
Okay so it's like the.

650
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,340
So.

651
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,560
The reason why.

652
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,480
It's a little low.

653
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,340
Okay I will boost it up a little.

654
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,340
This vault.

655
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,300
76.

656
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,880
Oh shit sound guy.

657
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,420
You are here.

658
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,880
I didn't know you were here.

659
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,600
Or not.

660
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,280
I checked if you were online on discord.

661
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,400
But you weren't.

662
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,440
But now you are on your phone.

663
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,360
Okay sound guy let me know.

664
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,180
Oh my god.

665
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:07,800
JK.

666
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:11,160
We don't care about your opinion on sound now chat.

667
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,260
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

668
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:23,990
Democracy is dead now.

669
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,110
Not just walls.

670
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:38,290
Not just buildings.

671
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:39,570
But hearts.

672
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:42,550
I actually want to know the lore of the key.

673
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:43,750
Vault 76.

674
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,830
As we stand here today.

675
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:50,230
We pray that the world will know peace.

676
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,810
But if that is not our destiny.

677
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:54,850
War must come.

678
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:55,410
He said the thing.

679
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:59,050
We stand together knowing.

680
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:01,770
That here in vault 76.

681
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:03,890
Our future.

682
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:05,050
Is not going to be the same.

683
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:06,130
Alright.

684
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:08,930
So for those who like did not pay attention to the lore.

685
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:11,530
Honestly the only reason why I know about vault 76.

686
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:12,570
Because I read the wiki.

687
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:13,850
Ha ha ha ha.

688
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:16,830
When I went through the deep dive of like vault lore.

689
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:17,970
But we.

690
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:19,010
Our mission.

691
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,250
Our social experiment.

692
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,470
In vault 76.

693
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,370
Is to basically like leave.

694
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:26,650
Leave the vault at 2076.

695
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:28,150
And then like try.

696
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,290
I think it's 2076.

697
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:32,270
And then like try to leave the vault.

698
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:33,950
No not 2076.

699
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:35,670
Our vault is 76.

700
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:38,590
And we leave the vault at an X amount of time.

701
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:39,730
Until.

702
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:42,750
And we are going up to surface world.

703
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:44,410
To make it a better place.

704
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:46,310
Okay.

705
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:46,890
Oh my god.

706
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:47,750
Fallout 76.

707
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:48,510
Vault 76.

708
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:49,070
Okay.

709
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:49,610
Okay.

710
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:50,110
I was going to say.

711
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,970
Vault 76 did not sound right.

712
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:53,610
Ha ha ha ha.

713
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:56,750
I mean 2076.

714
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:57,770
Did not sound right.

715
00:29:59,370 --> 00:29:59,890
2276.

716
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:02,350
Or is it 276.

717
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:04,910
The year 2276.

718
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:07,110
We leave the vault.

719
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:09,210
To save the surface world.

720
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,110
That is literally the whole plot.

721
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,810
And the reason why.

722
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:13,450
Okay.

723
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,650
The reason why.

724
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:15,910
I picked.

725
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:17,630
Fallout 76.

726
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:19,130
Um.

727
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:20,030
For.

728
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:21,570
To play this game.

729
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:23,210
After watching Fallout.

730
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,770
And not Fallout 3.

731
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:26,370
Or Fallout 4.

732
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:28,630
Is because.

733
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,410
Guys I know a lot of people were like.

734
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:32,410
Why are you starting with Fallout 76.

735
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:34,290
As your first Fallout game.

736
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:35,750
Like what the fuck is wrong with you.

737
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:36,270
Look.

738
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:37,070
I have a.

739
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:39,950
I have a perfectly good reason.

740
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:41,070
Because.

741
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,030
Look.

742
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:42,790
Guys.

743
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:44,570
The reason why.

744
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:46,030
Fallout 76.

745
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,410
Is my first go to game.

746
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:49,630
Is because.

747
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,330
If it's shit.

748
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:54,090
I can stop after one stream.

749
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:56,430
Ha ha ha ha ha.

750
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,130
Ha ha ha ha ha.

751
00:30:59,130 --> 00:30:59,550
Ha ha ha ha ha.

752
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:01,190
It is a.

753
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:03,570
Good one off stream.

754
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:04,890
And also.

755
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:06,430
Fallout 4.

756
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:09,150
Is a very long game.

757
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:10,590
Ha ha ha.

758
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:12,770
Same with New Vegas.

759
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:14,530
Fallout 4.

760
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,070
And New Vegas.

761
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:18,530
Are very long games.

762
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,250
And I know Fallout 4.

763
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:22,330
Is incredibly long.

764
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:25,190
Because I watched my dad.

765
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:26,590
Play Fallout 4.

766
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:28,510
For two years.

767
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:30,830
Ha ha ha ha ha.

768
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:33,530
Ha ha ha ha ha.

769
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:34,110
He.

770
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:36,750
He played Fallout 4.

771
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:39,050
Every fucking day.

772
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:41,270
For two.

773
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:42,870
Whole years.

774
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:44,870
And I was like.

775
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:46,330
Oh no.

776
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:48,150
I don't know.

777
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:48,850
Ha ha ha.

778
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:54,300
I don't know if I want to go.

779
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,600
Go through with that commitment chat.

780
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,500
I don't know.

781
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,620
If I want to go through.

782
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,340
With that commitment.

783
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,160
Of Fallout 4.

784
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,460
Every day.

785
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,080
Wake up.

786
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,260
I see my dad playing Fallout 4.

787
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,200
All the way.

788
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:12,940
To.

789
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,560
All the way.

790
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,260
To the night.

791
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,220
Repeat.

792
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,800
Whenever he has chance to play it.

793
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,820
He will be on Fallout 4.

794
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,860
And then he will make multiple characters.

795
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,260
And like.

796
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,500
Do multiple scenarios.

797
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,700
And then he will always be on Fallout 4.

798
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,520
He is not on Fallout 4 anymore.

799
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,740
After like.

800
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,660
I think after three years.

801
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,180
Three to four years.

802
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,340
He stopped playing Fallout 4.

803
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,480
Because he.

804
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,560
Started playing other games.

805
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:46,780
But like.

806
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,880
That is why.

807
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,420
We are on Fallout 76.

808
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,500
Because I don't think I have.

809
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,960
I don't think I can commit to that.

810
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,880
I don't think I can commit to that.

811
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,460
That is why.

812
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,760
We are starting with Fallout 76.

813
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,860
I also heard.

814
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,700
Praise be to Todd Howard.

815
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:10,780
But like.

816
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,320
Basically.

817
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,280
Apparently.

818
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,140
Fallout 76.

819
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,440
Did improve.

820
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,520
I think it is the worst part.

821
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,840
Because Fallout 76 started a country roads thing.

822
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:22,060
And then the game ended up being like.

823
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:22,900
Fucking garbage.

824
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:27,220
But it gave us country roads.

825
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:28,760
Anyway.

826
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,780
Apparently.

827
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,780
The game actually is a lot better now.

828
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,080
Similar to like.

829
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,280
Similar to like how.

830
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:36,980
Cyberpunk.

831
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,880
And what was it.

832
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,540
No man's land.

833
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,720
No man's sky.

834
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,020
I don't remember.

835
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:42,960
I never played that game.

836
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,040
No man something.

837
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,360
Sky, land, ocean.

838
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,860
It is one of them.

839
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,420
Apparently it improved.

840
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,220
So.

841
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,140
It didn't even have NPC.

842
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,060
Oh my gosh.

843
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,040
You guys just didn't understand Todd's vision.

844
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,980
You guys were just not smart enough.

845
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,020
Or high enough IQ.

846
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,920
To like grasp his vision.

847
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,820
When it comes to like Fallout.

848
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,780
But apparently it improved.

849
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,020
So like.

850
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,820
We get to see if it did improve.

851
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,600
We get to see if it did actually improve.

852
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,200
Guys.

853
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,540
And like.

854
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:24,300
Because a lot of new players are joining Fallout 76.

855
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,660
There's a lot of like veteran players.

856
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,860
That are coming in to the set.

857
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,560
Like coming in to help out the newer babies.

858
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,640
So maybe I'll have like.

859
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,440
Maybe.

860
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,440
Maybe I'll get like boosted in Fallout 76.

861
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,280
You know.

862
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,360
Guys.

863
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,380
I am not afraid.

864
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:47,500
To get.

865
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,520
To get.

866
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,480
Carried in Fallout 76.

867
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:54,600
Okay.

868
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:55,960
If any.

869
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,360
If any of the gamers out there.

870
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,800
With the power armor.

871
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,600
Would like to be my bodyguard.

872
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,140
And escort me.

873
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,400
Like okay.

874
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,000
I need to be like a beautiful woman.

875
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:06,760
Okay.

876
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:11,720
Okay.

877
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:12,560
Okay.

878
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:12,880
Look.

879
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,040
It's gonna work guys.

880
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,360
It's like how like in World of Warcraft.

881
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,680
There's like a lot of players in World of Warcraft.

882
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,920
And then they'll.

883
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:28,580
So they can get like free stuff.

884
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,260
We gotta be beautiful.

885
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,300
The most beautiful.

886
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,280
Vault dweller.

887
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,700
In the surface world.

888
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:44,350
We gotta protect the queen.

889
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:45,770
Okay.

890
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:46,410
Let's see.

891
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:47,230
Alright.

892
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,390
Sculpt.

893
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:49,910
Wait I can sculpt it?

894
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:54,290
Guys.

895
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:57,930
I can sculpt the face.

896
00:35:58,050 --> 00:35:59,330
What the fuck.

897
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,870
What do you mean?

898
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,830

899
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,630
I can sculpt the face.

900
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:08,950
What do you mean?

901
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:10,790
Okay.

902
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:12,790
I did.

903
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:15,170
I clicked on the face.

904
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:16,450
Oh my god.

905
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:19,450
A rare ginger.

906
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:20,270
Okay.

907
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:22,670
Redheads.

908
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:25,050
No!

909
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:26,790
Oh.

910
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,510
That's how you do it.

911
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:28,810
Okay.

912
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:29,850
Alright.

913
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:31,070
Okay.

914
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:31,950
I got it.

915
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:33,490
Oh my god.

916
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:35,050
This is like so complicated.

917
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:39,230
Wait.

918
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:40,150
What the fuck.

919
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,490
Why is this such a.

920
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:43,970
This is so complicated.

921
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:45,510
What the fuck.

922
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:45,830
Okay.

923
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:46,810
I'm just gonna go default.

924
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:47,530
Fuck this.

925
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:48,370
Okay.

926
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:48,730
Wait.

927
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:51,050
Colors.

928
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:52,550
Wait.

929
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:53,870
What the fuck did I click?

930
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,610
It's like World of Warcraft back then.

931
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:58,610
Where players would be like female players.

932
00:36:58,970 --> 00:36:59,810
So that like.

933
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:01,670
They would think that they're female.

934
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:02,890
So they would be like.

935
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:03,490
My lady.

936
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:04,950
Do you want me to like.

937
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:08,710
Do you want me to give you some gold?

938
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:09,390
My lady.

939
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:10,570
And then like.

940
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:11,190
You know.

941
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,270
I am a lady.

942
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:12,930
So like.

943
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:13,630
It's more ethical.

944
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,220
The original catfishing back then.

945
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:27,040
It's like old school runescape.

946
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:27,520
Okay.

947
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,680
It's more.

948
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,740
It's more ethical cause I'm a lady too.

949
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,360
But like.

950
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,560
The female nobile.

951
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:41,980
People.

952
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,020
People still.

953
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,180
Do that now.

954
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,480
I gotta be.

955
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,800
Oh my god.

956
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,420
Redheads.

957
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,120
Okay.

958
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,220
Cause they're rare.

959
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:55,440
And the surface people will be like.

960
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,240
Oh my god.

961
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,520
I haven't seen a redhead.

962
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,360
In a hundred years.

963
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:03,040
What a rare breed.

964
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,440
Okay.

965
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,180
This is good.

966
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,040
This is good.

967
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,400
I'm sorry.

968
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,080
I apologize to all the redheads in chat.

969
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:11,560
But I bet you in 200 years.

970
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,040
Isn't that true though?

971
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,200
I heard that like.

972
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:17,620
Redheads and gingers are actually dying out.

973
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,400
Cause it's a recessive gene.

974
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:20,520
So like.

975
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,300
Red hair slash gingers.

976
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,420
Is actually like slowly being.

977
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,220
Like.

978
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:26,900
Like.

979
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:30,900
The traits are slowly being bred out.

980
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,980
Because it's a recessive gene.

981
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,060
So like.

982
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,720
In 200 years.

983
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,960
It's gonna be even rarer.

984
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,260
It's gonna be like a shiny pokemon.

985
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,300
Yeah.

986
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:42,780
It's gonna.

987
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,360
You guys are actually going to this.

988
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,320
You're endangered right now.

989
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,600
You're endangered species.

990
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,340
At the moment.

991
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,600
So like.

992
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,160
This is justified.

993
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,180
We gotta keep the bloodline.

994
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,760
We gotta.

995
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,040
We gotta keep the bloodline.

996
00:38:59,200 --> 00:38:59,660
Going.

997
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,140
Uh.

998
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:04,420
Wow.

999
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,760
Shiny ginger.

1000
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,100
Okay.

1001
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:07,760
Alright.

1002
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,220
Let's see.

1003
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:08,920
What other makeup.

1004
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:10,800
Damage makeup.

1005
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:11,280
Okay.

1006
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,400
Blush one.

1007
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:13,640
Blush.

1008
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:13,960
Okay.

1009
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:14,320
We need.

1010
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:14,540
Oh.

1011
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:14,840
Wait.

1012
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:15,080
No.

1013
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:15,400
Wait.

1014
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:15,700
Fuck.

1015
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,000
Okay.

1016
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:16,320
Oh.

1017
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:16,920
No.

1018
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:17,380
No.

1019
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:17,620
No.

1020
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:17,840
No.

1021
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,100
No.

1022
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,760
You are not having any blemishes.

1023
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,020
You are.

1024
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:22,380
Okay.

1025
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,000
Okay.

1026
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,460
Actually.

1027
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,100
Okay.

1028
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:25,380
Wait.

1029
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:27,860
Uh.

00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:28,320
No.

1031
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,080
Blush.

1032
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:29,880
Okay.

1033
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,120
We gotta look like we're alive.

1034
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,600
So I think one is.

1035
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:33,680
The best.

1036
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:33,880
Wait.

1037
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,500
I wanted one.

1038
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:36,780
Yeah.

1039
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:37,160
What?

1040
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,020
Give me one.

1041
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,160
Give me one.

1042
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,860
I want this so I look alive.

1043
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,740
Oh my god.

1044
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,480
What?

1045
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,740
Give me one.

1046
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,740
I wanna look alive.

1047
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,140
For the surface people.

1048
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,360
I wanna.

1049
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,380
Oh.

1050
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,120
I need to be.

1051
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:55,480
Okay.

1052
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:55,980
Look.

1053
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,320
Like.

1054
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,260
Not gonna lie.

1055
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,220
But like.

1056
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,700
These controls fucking suck.

1057
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,780
Oh my god.

1058
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,480
Oh my.

1059
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,160
Makeup is definitely a rarity.

1060
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,900
Up on the surface world.

1061
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,900
So like.

1062
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,380
I need them to know.

1063
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,340
I need them to know.

1064
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,540
That I got it.

1065
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:17,980
Oh.

1066
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,040
Yes.

1067
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:19,460
Alright.

1068
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:19,940
Nice.

1069
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:20,280
Okay.

1070
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:20,740
Let's see.

1071
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:21,760
Um.

1072
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:23,740
Nice.

1073
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,080
Okay.

1074
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:24,920
What's body?

1075
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:25,680
Alright.

1076
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:26,760
Thin.

1077
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:27,460
Muscular.

1078
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,020
Okay.

1079
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:30,800
Okay.

1080
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,560
In 200 years.

1081
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,460
The muscular you are.

1082
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,920
The more attractive it is now.

1083
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,040
Okay guys.

1084
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:38,860
You won't understand.

1085
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,720
Because it's not.

1086
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,020
It's still 2023.

1087
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,920
But in 2223.

1088
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,280
But in 2223.

1089
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,400
But in 2223.

1090
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:49,960
Muscle is where it's at.

1091
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:50,580
Okay.

1092
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,300
The guys out there.

1093
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,300
Not only do they like.

1094
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,540
Are they like.

1095
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,540
Oh a redhead.

1096
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,500
They're like.

1097
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:58,500
Oh my god.

1098
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,480
She can lift.

1099
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:00,760
Sorry.

1100
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,140
Time is non-existent for me.

1101
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:05,920
2020.

1102
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,170
2076.

1103
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:08,820
2076.

1104
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:09,240
24.

1105
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,420
2276.

1106
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,660
Oh my god.

1107
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,140
Numbers don't work anymore right now.

1108
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:14,600
My brain.

1109
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:15,960
But like.

1110
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:16,880
Being muscular.

1111
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:20,100
Is an attractive trait right now in the surface world.

1112
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,220
You won't understand.

1113
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,820
Because you're not in that era.

1114
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:23,780
Alright.

1115
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,220
Here we go.

1116
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:24,900
I'm done.

1117
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,120
This is it.

1118
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,400
This is good.

1119
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,440
Name your character.

1120
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,520
Real female.

1121
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:36,900
There you go.

1122
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:37,540
Alright.

1123
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:40,460
Okay.

1124
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,080
Guys.

1125
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:43,960
It's gonna work.

1126
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,840
It's gonna work.

1127
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:46,880
Real female.

1128
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:47,360
Doki.

1129
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,280
Oh my god.

1130
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:49,660
That's me.

1131
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,220
Okay.

1132
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:50,940
Alright.

1133
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:53,620
Okay.

1134
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:53,800
Wait.

1135
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,120
What?

1136
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:54,960
What happened to me?

1137
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,320
Where am I?

1138
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,260
Where did I go?

1139
00:41:58,380 --> 00:41:59,420
Where did I go?

1140
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,560
Where did I go?

1141
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:06,140
Reset.

1142
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,380
Where did I go?

1143
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:14,850
I can't zoom.

1144
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:16,870
I don't know how.

1145
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:18,610
I don't know how.

1146
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:20,510
No.

1147
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:21,670
Okay.

1148
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:22,970
Escape.

1149
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:24,470
T.

1150
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:25,970
No.

1151
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:28,090
I didn't get to take a...

1152
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:29,430
Oh my god.

1153
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:31,610
I didn't even get to take a picture.

1154
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:33,230
Of my real female.

1155
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:34,230
Doki.

1156
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:36,950
I didn't even get to take a picture.

1157
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:38,890
I didn't even get to take a picture.

1158
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:41,930
NOOOOOO.

1159
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:46,710
I was gonna take such a good picture.

1160
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:48,510
I was gonna take such a good picture.

1161
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:49,350
I don't understand.

1162
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:52,810
Where is the option?

1163
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:53,510
Where is the option?

1164
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:54,310
Oh there it is.

1165
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:56,630
Oh thank God.

1166
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:57,070
Okay.

1167
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:57,930
We gotta.

1168
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:00,590
The mouse is like way too high.

1169
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:02,750
Like oh my god.

1170
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:03,730
Okay.

1171
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:05,010
Let's find.

1172
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:06,970
General subtitles on please.

1173
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:13,490
And then... we need to figure out... where the fuck is the sentence?

1174
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:15,630
Game?

1175
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:16,530
Oh there you go.

1176
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:17,130
Look sensitivity.

1177
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:19,490
Okay we gotta get that shit low.

1178
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,790
That shit is way too high right now.

1179
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:25,290
Oh this is optimal set.

1180
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:27,490
This is an optimal option page.

1181
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:31,930
Oh my god.

1182
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:33,210
I don't know.

1183
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:34,810
I think they look like they're the similar.

1184
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:36,090
At least they're similar.

1185
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:37,150
I think.

1186
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:40,590
Depth of view zero?

1187
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:42,390
Okay.

1188
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:46,030
I don't know.

1189
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:47,230
I can't tell.

1190
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:49,790
Oh no it should be field of view.

1191
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:50,350
Okay no.

1192
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:51,630
Depth of view has to be zero.

1193
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:53,830
Okay.

1194
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:57,070
And then... that's almost zero.

1195
00:43:57,130 --> 00:43:57,470
And then I'll wait for it.

1196
00:43:57,490 --> 00:43:59,930
I'll raise the current FOV to 85.

1197
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:00,790
Okay.

1198
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:02,790
85 seems to work.

1199
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:04,390
Alright here we go.

1200
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:06,490
I couldn't read properly at one point.

1201
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:06,830
Alright.

1202
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:07,910
Here we go.

1203
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:09,370
Alright.

1204
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:11,910
Okay how do I move?

1205
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,000
How do I...

1206
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,600
Why is my hands like this?

1207
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,600
Oh my... oh okay dude it's from my fist.

1208
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:22,440
Guys.

1209
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:23,460
Oh.

1210
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:25,060
Guys.

1211
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:26,720
Why is it...

1212
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:28,840
Is it...

1213
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:29,880
It's not WASD?

1214
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:30,980
Is it not?

1215
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,140
W... S... Yeah it is!

1216
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:39,700
Why is it so difficult?

1217
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:42,560
Why?

1218
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,540
Why is it so difficult to move?

1219
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,700
Why am I running in place?

1220
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,080
Oh.

1221
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,000
Okay I got it.

1222
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:51,340
I got it.

1223
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:51,580
Guys.

1224
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:51,760
Guys.

1225
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:52,800
I'm figuring it out.

1226
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:53,640
Guys.

1227
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:56,100
Guys.

1228
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:56,980
Okay it's working.

1229
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:57,400
Alright.

1230
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,420
There we go.

1231
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,260
We figured it out guys.

1232
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:03,340
Alright we're figuring it out guys.

1233
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,460
Oh my god.

1234
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:07,340
It just works.

1235
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:09,960
Is my frames uncapped?

1236
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,320
Oh my god.

1237
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:11,760
Okay.

1238
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:12,960
Okay guys.

1239
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,700
We're slowly figuring this out.

1240
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:16,240
How do I... Okay.

1241
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:16,920
There we go.

1242
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:17,600
Preset.

1243
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:21,080
There is nothing that tells me that I can cap my frames.

1244
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:24,860
Oh my god.

1245
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:25,360
Okay.

1246
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:25,700
Okay.

1247
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:26,860
Alright.

1248
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:28,680
We have a problem.

1249
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:35,000
We might have a little problem.

1250
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:39,580
Alright.

1251
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,600
Don't worry.

1252
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:41,700
Everything will be okay.

1253
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:42,540
Uh.

1254
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,880
I just had to...

1255
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:47,320
Okay.

1256
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:50,880
We might... We might have a little problem.

1257
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,220
Time to go into my documents.

1258
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:55,720
My games.

1259
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:56,680
Alright.

1260
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:58,880
16x the details.

1261
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:02,380
I don't even know what words you're talking about right now to me.

1262
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:05,120
I can't tell what you're trying to say.

1263
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:10,140
Okay.

1264
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,440
But don't worry.

1265
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,240
Everything will be fine.

1266
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,360
Everything will be fine guys.

1267
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:16,440
Do not worry.

1268
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:17,820
We'll be okay.

1269
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,880
Everything will be okay.

1270
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:21,200
The texture... whatever.

1271
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,500
I'll try... I'll try detail for texture.

1272
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,020
That should be...

1273
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:26,560
16x the details.

1274
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:27,920
What does that mean?

1275
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:32,060
16x the details.

1276
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,000
You don't understand.

1277
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:34,600
Okay.

1278
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:35,300
Alright.

1279
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:36,600
Oh hey.

1280
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:37,580
There's the TV.

1281
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:38,620
Oh.

1282
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:39,660
This is my vault.

1283
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,020
Oh my god.

1284
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,060
I have awards?

1285
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,060
What are my awards?

1286
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:49,180
Animal Halloween costume contest?

1287
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:50,920
Guys.

1288
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,180
You don't understand.

1289
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:55,500
I have the outstanding achievement award.

1290
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:58,280
At Vault-Tec.

1291
00:46:58,380 --> 00:46:59,380
You don't understand.

1292
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:02,480
Guys.

1293
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,040
I'm practically perfect.

1294
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,080
Alright.

1295
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,260
Here we go.

1296
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:12,220
Oh.

1297
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:12,900
There's my Pip-Boy.

1298
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:14,860
Alright.

1299
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:15,680
Nice.

1300
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,380
16x the details award.

1301
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:21,800
Look.

1302
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:23,480
There's my Pip-Boy.

1303
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:25,420
Alright.

1304
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:26,920
Tab to open.

1305
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:28,140
Reclamation day.

1306
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:29,360
It's Reclamation Day.

1307
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:32,740
Those surface dwellers will not know what hit them.

1308
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:33,660
Alright.

1309
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:34,820
I'm perfectly healthy.

1310
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:36,120
It seems like...

1311
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:36,840
Guys.

1312
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,980
It seems like Reclamation Day came and passed months ago.

1313
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:44,160
But now it's time for me to leave the vault and rebuild America.

1314
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:50,180
It's my turn to reshape the world in my image.

1315
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:51,360
What?

1316
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,340
Will you live in a Doki world?

1317
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:55,520
How do I change my POV?

1318
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,440
Should I play it?

1319
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:00,560
Yeah.

1320
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:01,560
I should play in first person.

1321
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:02,520
What I mean?

1322
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:08,340
I'm gonna fucking turn down the sense just a little bit more.

1323
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:09,740
It still feels...

1324
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,060
I'm doing my part.

1325
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:12,680
Oh.

1326
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:13,320
There it is.

1327
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:15,120
I am proud of you.

1328
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:16,680
Okay.

1329
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:18,960
I'm gonna play in third person just to like...

1330
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:19,240
Ooh.

1331
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:20,400
God.

1332
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:20,660
I'm...

1333
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:21,260
Okay.

1334
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:22,260
It's not flat, guys.

1335
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,200
You see that little bump?

1336
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:24,600
There's something there.

1337
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:28,740
That's hot in 2276, guys.

1338
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:29,240
You don't understand.

1339
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:35,300
Because back... back when in the future, it's harder to get good butts.

1340
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:39,560
So like even a little bump is like... is like a good thing, guys.

1341
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:40,860
Okay?

1342
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:45,700
Flat butts became meta.

1343
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:47,480
Alright, guys?

1344
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,540
So like...

1345
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:48,940
Anyway.

1346
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:53,240
Anybody that even has like a good butt like mine, you see like right here?

1347
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,300
Right here.

1348
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,300
That little bump there?

1349
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:56,120
That's rare.

1350
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:57,260
That's so rare.

1351
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:02,100
Hello.

1352
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:02,580
Hello.

1353
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:03,800
Cosworth!

1354
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:05,000
At last.

1355
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,260
Today is your reclamation day.

1356
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:13,540
I bet you're just bursting your bolts to get out there and...

1357
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:14,120
Of course!

1358
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:17,220
I will reshape the world in my image!

1359
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:19,400
I'm re...

1360
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,300
Do we know anything about the world outside?

1361
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:22,420
Nothing at all.

1362
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:29,580
The exterior sensors were taken out of commission after that unfortunate business with the nuclear bombs.

1363
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:31,240
Am I the first?

1364
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:38,900
Having been gone so long, I cannot begin to speculate how they've transformed Appalachia already.

1365
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:43,840
What about the Overseer?

1366
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:45,260
That one was not likely to get one.

1367
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,980
It's been months.

1368
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:51,340
Besides, she left this place behind to reclaim America.

1369
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,160
It's past time to follow her example.

1370
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,380
Wait, am I the last one?

1371
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:56,860
Where's everybody else?

1372
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:59,240
I was the last one to go?

1373
00:49:59,500 --> 00:49:59,860
Excellent.

1374
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:01,200
Adventure...

1375
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,340
Everybody left me?

1376
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,320
Opportunity awaits you, folks.

1377
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,780
What the fuck was I scared about?

1378
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:08,960
The Kiosks have valuable information to help you thrive out there.

1379
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:10,060
Oh, okay.

1380
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:10,960
Get cracking!

1381
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:12,960
Don't worry, I got this.

1382
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:14,940
I got this, Crutchley.

1383
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:16,220
I got abandoned!

1384
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:24,980
How could they abandon me with my fucking nice ass and, like, rare ginger red head?

1385
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:26,760
Okay, voice.

1386
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,080
The thing is...

1387
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:36,220
The thing is, Sound Guy, I don't know if this voice is, like, considered voice chat voice or, like...

1388
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:36,820
Alright, fuck it.

1389
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:38,660
Is it?

1390
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:39,380
I can't tell.

1391
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:40,020
I think so.

1392
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:40,800
Alright.

1393
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,020
We're gonna risk it.

1394
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:43,160
Alright.

1395
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:44,040
Here we go.

1396
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:44,840
Here we go.

1397
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,620
I'm so ready for the outside world.

1398
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:48,300
It took me years.

1399
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:51,420
I had so much trauma and that's why I was stuck in this vault for so long.

1400
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:52,700
But this is it.

1401
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,200
This is gonna be different.

1402
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:01,980
Being alone in isolation for so many years has made me worthy of going outside.

1403
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:05,900
Oh, I should take some Red Axe and purify water.

1404
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:06,480
Yeah.

1405
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:08,520
Consume drinks to fill your...

1406
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,300
No, there's thirst meter.

1407
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,360
Open your pit bull...

1408
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,820
Boy, I keep saying pit...

1409
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:15,460
I keep saying pit bull.

1410
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:17,220
Pit boy.

1411
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,880
And your thirst meter drains over time.

1412
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,940
Okay, armor, food, apparel...

1413
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:24,080
Wait, where's my water?

1414
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,380
I only have Red Axe.

1415
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:27,000
Where's my water?

1416
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:28,400
Did you take my water?

1417
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:29,920
Or did I just drink it already?

1418
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:33,160
Oh boy, I sure do love the survival mechanics.

1419
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:33,800
Don't worry.

1420
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:39,560
They're gonna see real female Doki and I am going to get so much water.

1421
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,780
Okay, we need a...

1422
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,260
Radaway and Simpax.

1423
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:48,220
Did I drink it?

1424
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:48,480
No!

1425
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:51,600
Always stay stocked with pedicels.

1426
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,360
And don't forget to use them.

1427
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:57,020
I can't believe I drank it.

1428
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,080
I can't fucking believe it.

1429
00:51:59,220 --> 00:51:59,900
Wait, what's this?

1430
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:04,880
It must be terrifying leaving this warm, secure vault for a hostile to the wilderness.

1431
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:05,460
Building supplies.

1432
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,940
With no running warplanes or electricity.

1433
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:10,820
Wait, why would I leave then?

1434
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:14,360
Why can't I stay here forever with all of you guys, my robot friends?

1435
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:15,700
It's okay.

1436
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:18,020
It's okay if I want to be in isolation.

1437
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:19,560
You know?

1438
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,380
It's okay if I never want to leave the nest.

1439
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:23,440
What's this?

1440
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:24,120
Join a team.

1441
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:33,580
Open emote G.

1442
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:35,240
Open...

1443
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:35,760
Ooh!

1444
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:36,640
G.

1445
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:39,060
Yeah!

1446
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:42,940
It's okay.

1447
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,080
I'll just keep sending all the people this emote.

1448
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:45,340
Okay.

1449
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:45,640
I know.

1450
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:46,060
I understand.

1451
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:49,420
All right.

1452
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:53,200
If you're a dragoon, you guys have to come up to me and use this emote.

1453
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:01,840
And then I'll be like, yeah.

1454
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:05,580
All right.

1455
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,160
This is a dragoon emote.

1456
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:07,820
Okay, guys?

1457
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:12,500
This one right here is the dragoon emote.

1458
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,240
Just so you guys know.

1459
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:15,340
And you guys can see it.

1460
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:16,140
I just didn't know that.

1461
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:16,620
What's this?

1462
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:20,200
You do remember the whole point of Reclamation Day?

1463
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:22,780
Reclaiming Appalachia?

1464
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,080
Never too late.

1465
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:25,260
Okay.

1466
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,040
Let's see.

1467
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:26,940
What is this?

1468
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,720
Build a camp after you leave and press Z once you're in the wilderness.

1469
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:31,340
Okay.

1470
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:32,720
Is there like any extra items?

1471
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:33,980
Is there anywhere?

1472
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:36,240
Oh, wait.

1473
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:37,180
What the fuck is this?

1474
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,020
I know it will be scary out there.

1475
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:41,480
Oh, I can have glasses and a pet?

1476
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:42,600
Get a job.

1477
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,920
Thank you for staying with Vault-Tec.

1478
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:45,300
I'm so happy.

1479
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:45,800
Okay.

1480
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:47,780
I gotta...

1481
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:48,520
Okay, guys.

1482
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:48,780
Guys.

1483
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,000
We gotta look smart.

1484
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:50,480
Okay?

1485
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:52,420
We gotta look smart.

1486
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:54,360
Where the fuck is it?

1487
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:55,060
Party hat?

1488
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:56,300
Wait.

1489
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:57,340
Where's the...

1490
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:58,380
Oh, there you go.

1491
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,480
Party hat.

1492
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:03,080
Okay.

1493
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:03,340
No.

1494
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:03,860
Actually...

1495
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:04,180
No.

1496
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,120
That looks a little stupid.

1497
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:07,900
I can't let the surface dwellers know I'm blind.

1498
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,320
I can't let them know.

1499
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,220
That shows weakness, guys.

1500
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:12,900
We can't let them know that we're blind.

1501
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:14,100
Chat.

1502
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:15,320
It shows weakness.

1503
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:17,920
They'll be like, what the fuck is...

1504
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:28,840
The surface dwellers will be like, we kill off all the people that show blindness so we can be sure that the population is healthy with strong eyes.

1505
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,320
They can't afford to...

1506
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:35,480
It's so hard to find glasses, guys, in the surface world.

1507
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,820
We don't have machines that make glasses anymore.

1508
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:44,280
They'll see me as weak if I have glasses on.

1509
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:47,000
Oh, this is the overseer mission.

1510
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:49,120
Okay, here we go.

1511
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:51,960
Weakness is a sin!

1512
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:54,100
Okay, Vault Tech report.

1513
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,540
Terminals can hold press R to reject or...

1514
00:54:57,540 --> 00:54:58,940
Oh wait, but I want to read this.

1515
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:08,120
One of nine years after the vault door closes, you are to prepare your citizens to leave Vault 76 and be in the process called reclamation.

1516
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:14,540
Specifics will be decimated automatically as that time approaches.

1517
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:15,320
I'm in the process.

1518
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:22,120
After reclamation day, you are personally ordered to find and secure three nuclear silos codenamed Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie.

1519
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:29,720
If these sites are still nuclear capable, ensure no one except Vault Tech can access our launch nuclear ordinance.

1520
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:34,560
To be cleared, even there are other authorities, whether government or otherwise, they're...

1521
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:36,520
What?

1522
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:37,380
They're what?

1523
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:38,700
They're what?

1524
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:42,660
I'll never know!

1525
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,700
Okay, what's the holotape?

1526
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:46,460
Overseer!

1527
00:55:51,170 --> 00:55:56,490
Because whoever is listening to this had the moxie to try to find out where I've gone.

1528
00:55:58,070 --> 00:55:59,530
But I'm glad you did.

1529
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:01,970
Truth is, I need your help.

1530
00:56:02,450 --> 00:56:08,290
I've been given a task and I've decided to break protocol and tell you what it is.

1531
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:12,190
Because if there's one thing I've learned in these past few years...

1532
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:13,110
She broke protocol!

1533
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:13,330
Look out!

1534
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:33,060
Okay, but like I can't be the only one doing this.

1535
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:37,420
Like I came in here one or two years late.

1536
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,800
What the fuck did Fallout 76 come out?

1537
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:57,910
We need subtitles?

1538
00:56:58,210 --> 00:56:59,770
Guys, I turn on subtitles.

1539
00:57:00,090 --> 00:57:02,050
It is not my fault that...

1540
00:57:02,910 --> 00:57:06,110
There were a lot of issues in this game release guys.

1541
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:10,690
If by two plus... 2018?!

1542
00:57:10,690 --> 00:57:19,510
If by six years they still have not added subtitles for that... for the fucking tutorial for that part?

1543
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:21,470
It's not my problem.

1544
00:57:24,890 --> 00:57:27,130
It's general sub... Did I not turn it on?

1545
00:57:27,770 --> 00:57:30,150
I thought I turned general subtitles on.

1546
00:57:30,850 --> 00:57:31,970
Okay, let's try.

1547
00:57:32,070 --> 00:57:32,690
Let's see.

1548
00:57:33,110 --> 00:57:35,350
I swear to god I turned it on chat.

1549
00:57:35,570 --> 00:57:37,830
There's no fucking way I didn't turn it on.

1550
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:40,170
There's so many fucking... Okay.

1551
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:40,950
Display.

1552
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:44,210
Subtitles.

1553
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:46,090
Where the fuck is the subtitles?

1554
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:46,930
There you go.

1555
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:47,690
See?!

1556
00:57:47,690 --> 00:57:49,150
On, on, on!

1557
00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:50,390
I told you guys!

1558
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:52,170
It is not my fault.

1559
00:57:55,070 --> 00:57:57,590
I... I told you all!

1560
00:57:57,910 --> 00:57:59,570
I had... had it all.

1561
00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:10,910
It is not my fault that by... in six years they did not provide you the subtitles.

1562
00:58:11,790 --> 00:58:13,430
I did my job.

1563
00:58:15,870 --> 00:58:18,850
Okay, we turned down sound effects a little bit.

1564
00:58:18,850 --> 00:58:20,810
And then... uh...

1565
00:58:21,270 --> 00:58:21,870
Alright, effects.

1566
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:22,370
Okay.

1567
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:26,410
We'll turn on... turn down and then we'll turn up the volume.

1568
00:58:26,910 --> 00:58:27,430
Okay.

1569
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:28,930
There you go.

1570
00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:30,370
I hope it's okay now.

1571
00:58:30,770 --> 00:58:31,290
Alright.

1572
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:33,050
Sometimes it just works.

1573
00:58:33,370 --> 00:58:35,750
Guys, sometimes it just works guys.

1574
00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:37,330
You guys just didn't try hard enough.

1575
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:42,860
Okay.

1576
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:43,840
Let's see.

1577
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:45,340
What's this projector?

1578
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,860
Oh, this is like Pip-Boy stuff.

1579
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:51,620
Alright, it's time to leave.

1580
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,440
You mom possess the skills necessary to accomplish anything.

1581
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:57,140
How does it again?

1582
00:58:57,340 --> 00:58:59,180
Guys, I just didn't buy the... what was it?

1583
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:01,080
Fallout... Fallout First or whatever?

1584
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,520
Oh, this is where the slim pack.

1585
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:03,980
Okay.

1586
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:05,280
Open the door.

1587
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:05,700
I'm ready.

1588
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:10,400
I'm so fucking ready to go out in the surface world.

1589
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:14,740
And... and recolonize the world.

1590
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:16,080
Guys.

1591
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:17,980
Andreas, thank you for the file!

1592
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:18,840
Get the ships back!

1593
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:19,080
Just take it.

1594
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:19,520
Thank you.

1595
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:20,080
This is it.

1596
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:21,600
This is it!

1597
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:24,240
Real female Doki is here!

1598
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:25,980
Au revoir!

1599
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:32,840
I'm ready!

1600
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:35,340
Gator, thank you for the super chat.

1601
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:35,660
Thank you.

1602
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:35,940
Thank you.

1603
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:38,600
Just letting you know there is a roleplay community for this game.

1604
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:39,380
Oh no.

1605
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:39,680
Okay.

1606
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:41,220
Fresh dweller.

1607
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:43,280
Battle ready.

1608
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:47,100
Dwellers leave the vault at level 20 with a special loadout of their choice.

1609
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:48,740
Does this mean I have to...

1610
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:48,960
pay?

1611
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:49,980
Okay.

1612
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:53,680
Oh no.

1613
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:54,820
Guys, which is better?

1614
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:56,860
Fresh dweller?

1615
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:58,840
Or battle ready?

1616
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:04,220
Fresh dweller leave the vault at level 2 with a perk.

1617
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:05,600
Uh...

1618
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:06,660
of their choice.

1619
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:10,100
They require training before taking on more difficult challenges.

1620
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:11,620
Prepare to jump... Okay.

1621
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:12,800
I'm gonna get fresh dweller.

1622
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:13,960
Alright.

1623
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:14,740
Pick 20?

1624
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:17,920
People say it's more fun to be a fresh dweller.

1625
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:18,720
Okay.

1626
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,120
Action dweller inspiration.

1627
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:23,200
Grant 5 bonitino with other vaults.

1628
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:25,040
Start with a slugger perk card.

1629
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:27,580
Plus 20% damage.

1630
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:30,640
Grants 15% action point regeneration.

1631
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:32,560
Gunslinger!

1632
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:33,720
Oh my god.

1633
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:34,900
I could be a support player.

1634
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:37,940
Guys!

1635
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:38,740
Guys!

1636
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:43,140
If I get adopted by a surface dweller with...

1637
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:45,000
with like a power armor.

1638
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:46,980
I could be like, don't worry sir.

1639
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:47,780
I got you!

1640
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:54,320
Okay.

1641
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:54,940
Alright.

1642
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:55,900
No you...

1643
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:57,140
put gun.

1644
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:02,620
Mercy all over again.

1645
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:03,900
No.

1646
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:04,480
Don't.

1647
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,100
Don't be a mercy.

1648
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:07,740
Okay.

1649
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:10,720
Okay.

1650
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:11,500
Okay.

1651
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:12,780
We'll go for gunslinger.

1652
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:14,440
Alright.

1653
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:15,400
I wanna...

1654
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:15,640
Wait.

1655
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:15,980
Actually.

1656
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:16,960
What are the perks?

1657
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:19,440
I didn't even look at the actual perks.

1658
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:19,900
Okay.

1659
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:20,520
Agility.

1660
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:22,020
My luck is one.

1661
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:23,400
That sounds like me.

1662
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:26,460
Okay.

1663
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:26,940
Intelligence.

1664
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:27,500
Oh yeah.

1665
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:28,800
Nevermind.

1666
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:30,320
We should definitely not be first aid.

1667
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:32,220
We have like intelligence too.

1668
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:33,900
That doesn't sound right.

1669
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:35,520
That does not sound like me.

1670
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:35,740
Alright.

1671
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:36,600
Gunslinger.

1672
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:38,120
Is only guns.

1673
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:38,560
Yeah!

1674
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:40,400
That's right!

1675
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:42,980
I wanna be a gunslinger.

1676
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:45,960
I just realized.

1677
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:47,320
Remember guns are very rare.

1678
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:48,780
But it's okay.

1679
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:49,640
We'll make it work.

1680
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:52,040
We'll make it work.

1681
01:01:59,830 --> 01:02:00,430
No.

1682
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,090
Select help from the...

1683
01:02:02,090 --> 01:02:03,590
Oh my god!

1684
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:04,310
What?

1685
01:02:07,170 --> 01:02:07,770
Wait.

1686
01:02:07,830 --> 01:02:10,050
How did you know out of every one?

1687
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:11,410
Now give me shit.

1688
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:13,030
I'm a real female.

1689
01:02:15,390 --> 01:02:16,830
Oh my god.

1690
01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:18,830
They got the gamble correct.

1691
01:02:21,730 --> 01:02:23,370
Oh my god.

1692
01:02:23,690 --> 01:02:24,190
Oh my god.

1693
01:02:24,190 --> 01:02:24,550
How did...

1694
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:27,550
What?

1695
01:02:29,450 --> 01:02:31,090
Oh my god!

1696
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:33,030
I'm fucking rich.

1697
01:02:37,070 --> 01:02:38,270
Holy shit.

1698
01:02:38,470 --> 01:02:41,310
I can't believe they got the RNG.

1699
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:42,450
Wait.

1700
01:02:42,470 --> 01:02:42,850
No.

1701
01:02:42,850 --> 01:02:45,010
I was too busy looking at it.

1702
01:02:45,050 --> 01:02:45,830
Give me, give me.

1703
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:47,950
Oh my god.

1704
01:02:48,090 --> 01:02:49,350
We are going to be the first aid.

1705
01:02:49,350 --> 01:02:49,590
We are going to be the best pistol in the world.

1706
01:02:50,830 --> 01:02:52,250
Wait, did they give it to me?

1707
01:02:52,370 --> 01:02:53,890
I couldn't tell.

1708
01:02:54,830 --> 01:02:55,570
Okay, wait.

1709
01:02:55,670 --> 01:02:56,950
I think they did, right?

1710
01:02:57,310 --> 01:02:58,690
I couldn't tell.

1711
01:02:58,790 --> 01:02:59,910
I was too busy looking.

1712
01:03:00,430 --> 01:03:03,610
Did they... I have it?

1713
01:03:03,850 --> 01:03:05,270
Give me more.

1714
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:13,910
Okay, how do I accept it?

1715
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:16,730
How do I...

1716
01:03:16,730 --> 01:03:18,130
Oh, is this everything?

1717
01:03:18,430 --> 01:03:19,810
I want all your items.

1718
01:03:24,270 --> 01:03:25,610
Okay, combat knife.

1719
01:03:25,930 --> 01:03:26,850
Alright, here you go.

1720
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:27,750
Everything.

1721
01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:30,170
I'll let you keep your glasses.

1722
01:03:33,890 --> 01:03:34,570
Don't worry.

1723
01:03:35,030 --> 01:03:37,770
I'll let you keep your glasses and your party hat.

1724
01:03:37,850 --> 01:03:39,570
You get your glasses and your party hat.

1725
01:03:39,770 --> 01:03:40,950
Give me everything else.

1726
01:03:42,670 --> 01:03:45,170
Guys, I need all of this!

1727
01:03:45,390 --> 01:03:46,710
They have so much!

1728
01:03:46,730 --> 01:03:48,930
They have so much!

1729
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:49,630
They have so much!

1730
01:03:49,630 --> 01:03:51,070
God, MMOs are so easy.

1731
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:55,650
Okay, how do I click yet?

1732
01:03:55,730 --> 01:03:56,670
How do I...

1733
01:03:56,670 --> 01:03:58,670
How do I accept all of this?

1734
01:04:02,790 --> 01:04:05,750
How is this man gonna survive?

1735
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:09,450
Okay, how do I accept all of this, guys?

1736
01:04:09,490 --> 01:04:10,190
You want this?

1737
01:04:10,570 --> 01:04:12,230
I'll request this right now.

1738
01:04:12,230 --> 01:04:12,850
You don't...

1739
01:04:15,170 --> 01:04:15,690
What?

1740
01:04:16,230 --> 01:04:17,510
Wait, did I get it?

1741
01:04:17,690 --> 01:04:19,150
No, you still have your items!

1742
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:24,010
I worked so hard.

1743
01:04:24,210 --> 01:04:25,370
Give me...

1744
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:28,030
Okay.

1745
01:04:28,330 --> 01:04:29,290
Oh my god.

1746
01:04:29,370 --> 01:04:31,310
I wish there was an easier way.

1747
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:38,770
I wish... I wish there was an easier way to take all of his belongings.

1748
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:40,530
No, they...

1749
01:04:40,530 --> 01:04:41,990
They... How could you cancel?

1750
01:04:42,950 --> 01:04:44,810
How could you cancel?

1751
01:04:45,450 --> 01:04:47,830
It worked so hard.

1752
01:04:48,070 --> 01:04:49,990
I can't believe it.

1753
01:04:50,110 --> 01:04:52,670
I can't believe you would do such a thing.

1754
01:04:52,990 --> 01:04:53,810
I literally...

1755
01:04:53,810 --> 01:04:58,810
I let you keep your glasses and your party hat and you still cancel on me.

1756
01:04:59,110 --> 01:05:01,410
I can't believe you would do such a thing.

1757
01:05:03,490 --> 01:05:05,770
At least get rid of...

1758
01:05:05,770 --> 01:05:07,450
I let them keep the hat!

1759
01:05:07,870 --> 01:05:09,210
And the glasses!

1760
01:05:10,510 --> 01:05:11,150
Guys...

1761
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:12,350
Tell him...

1762
01:05:12,350 --> 01:05:13,210
Drop your bag!

1763
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:18,290
No, because I want the items that he has on.

1764
01:05:18,730 --> 01:05:22,770
Like, I want to take everything he has except for the party hat and the...

1765
01:05:22,770 --> 01:05:26,210
Except for the party hat and the glasses.

1766
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:27,390
Okay.

1767
01:05:27,570 --> 01:05:28,350
There you go.

1768
01:05:29,370 --> 01:05:31,170
It's not okay to cancel.

1769
01:05:31,450 --> 01:05:31,890
What?

1770
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:32,550
You bitch!

1771
01:05:34,090 --> 01:05:36,850
I went so high pressing space.

1772
01:05:39,650 --> 01:05:41,310
Empty your pockets right now.

1773
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:49,240
No, it's not random.

1774
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:51,100
It's not a random because...

1775
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:52,360
Oh, nice.

1776
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:52,740
Okay.

1777
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:53,740
Nice.

1778
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:55,400
Okay.

1779
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:57,480
Nice.

1780
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:58,340
Alright, keep going.

1781
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:07,260
Keep going.

1782
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:12,740
Yes, take it all off.

1783
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:16,340
Take everything off except for your glasses and your hat.

1784
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:17,540
No, no.

1785
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:18,920
Keep your glasses and hat on.

1786
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:19,920
That's all I ask.

1787
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:20,480
Keep...

1788
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:27,840
You keep your glasses and hat on.

1789
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:31,900
Reverse.

1790
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:35,000
Sorry, I'm done playing with you.

1791
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,220
He has more items.

1792
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:49,520
Oh, my God.

1793
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:53,720
You know he's a gamer because he has a different item on.

1794
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,580
He has different clothes on.

1795
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:59,840
Strong and dragon.

1796
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:01,000
Okay.

1797
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:05,860
You're lucky I'm being very generous and, like, I'm only...

1798
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:07,240
I'm being very generous...

1799
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:11,180
I'm only asking for like just a little bit of your stuff.

1800
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:12,640
Just a little...

1801
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:18,960
How am I even?

1802
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:25,840
I... look, they offer... guys, guys, they offer it for a real female Doki.

1803
01:07:26,260 --> 01:07:28,540
Okay, guys, it's not my fault.

1804
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:30,600
They... oh my god, he has so many items.

1805
01:07:30,740 --> 01:07:32,020
I'm so fucking...

1806
01:07:32,020 --> 01:07:36,340
I'm gonna be so... oh my god, I have to keep scrolling.

1807
01:07:39,860 --> 01:07:42,620
Okay, what do I do after I requested stuff?

1808
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:44,060
I'm just gonna request random things.

1809
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:44,920
What do I do?

1810
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:47,940
Yeah, it's not robbery if they're willing to give it to me.

1811
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:49,320
Do I just press T?

1812
01:07:54,620 --> 01:07:55,060
No!

1813
01:07:55,060 --> 01:07:56,160
I want everything.

1814
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:06,220
Okay, oh my god, I want everything.

1815
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:07,140
I'm just... okay.

1816
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:07,880
Press T after.

1817
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:08,200
Okay.

1818
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:12,000
Okay, I'm just gonna like randomly...

1819
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:14,900
Okay, I'm just gonna... oh my god, there's so many things.

1820
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,100
I'm just gonna randomly request stuff right now, right here.

1821
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:18,100
And then...

1822
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:20,680
Alright, here we go.

1823
01:08:20,940 --> 01:08:24,180
Oh my god, he literally gave me his life savings, guys.

1824
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:27,360
Oh my god, 52 radaways?

1825
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:30,940
Oh my god, he gave me his life savings.

1826
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:33,040
And then...

1827
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:34,400
Show all.

1828
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:36,940
Okay, what do I do?

1829
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:38,340
How do I take it?

1830
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:39,940
And then what do I do?

1831
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:47,300
How do I...

1832
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:49,140
How do I take their things?

1833
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:51,500
Alright, I'll give you my glasses.

1834
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:54,440
There you go.

1835
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:57,740
There you go.

1836
01:08:58,260 --> 01:09:00,360
I would like this much...

1837
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:02,720
I would like all this bottle cap for this.

1838
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:04,920
Okay.

1839
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:05,460
Okay.

1840
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:06,220
Okay.

1841
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:07,240
Okay.

1842
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:09,700
There.

1843
01:09:11,220 --> 01:09:11,920
Plus that.

1844
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:13,020
Is that good?

1845
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:15,300
Fair trade.

1846
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:16,580
Is this fair?

1847
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:23,140
Is this...

1848
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:24,400
Is this...

1849
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:25,380
Is this fair, guys?

1850
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:28,040
Is this fair?

1851
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:29,780
What a deal!

1852
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:32,220
Oh my god.

1853
01:09:33,820 --> 01:09:36,760
Can she trade at that level?

1854
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:41,460
It's not stealing!

1855
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:44,260
It's so fair!

1856
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:47,500
Guys, this is not stealing!

1857
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:49,580
Except...

1858
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:50,980
Alright.

1859
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:51,580
Oh!

1860
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:56,000
That's how you do it!

1861
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:58,400
Oh my god!

1862
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:00,780
Is that it?

1863
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:03,520
Except...

1864
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:04,880
Oh my god!

1865
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:05,740
Guys!

1866
01:10:06,220 --> 01:10:06,860
Oh!

1867
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:08,620
I bought their stuff!

1868
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:11,020
Oh, I get it!

1869
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:12,040
I get it now.

1870
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:13,180
I'll take your pie.

1871
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:14,440
Okay.

1872
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:15,540
And then...

1873
01:10:16,260 --> 01:10:17,200
And then...

1874
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:17,720
Um...

1875
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:19,880
Okay, they're giving me their rat away.

1876
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:21,540
And then...

1877
01:10:21,540 --> 01:10:23,520
How dare you request my antibiotics?

1878
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:25,860
How fucking dare you...

1879
01:10:30,620 --> 01:10:32,260
How dare you...

1880
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:33,340
You know...

1881
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:35,740
How dare you...

1882
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:37,160
If you want my antibiotics...

1883
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:37,400
I'm...

1884
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:40,620
I'm...

1885
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:41,940
Throw your stuff on the ground right now.

1886
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:45,880
Alright.

1887
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:46,720
Guys.

1888
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:47,140
Okay.

1889
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:48,920
Why don't we be a team, guys?

1890
01:10:49,260 --> 01:10:50,740
Guys, we're gonna be a team.

1891
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:51,980
Invite to the team.

1892
01:10:52,660 --> 01:10:53,460
Invite to team.

1893
01:10:53,740 --> 01:10:53,940
Alright.

1894
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:55,280
You guys are gonna protect me.

1895
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:58,000
Level 52 and my level 53.

1896
01:10:58,160 --> 01:10:59,840
You guys will protect me, alright?

1897
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:01,360
Oh my god!

1898
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:02,840
I have a group!

1899
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:05,140
Join my team.

1900
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:07,140
Are you in my team?

1901
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:07,660
Alright.

1902
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:09,160
Throw your items on the ground.

1903
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:12,140
Drop the items!

1904
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:15,060
It's just easier.

1905
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:17,580
Wait.

1906
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:20,340
Why aren't you in my group?

1907
01:11:20,740 --> 01:11:21,660
Join my group.

1908
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:23,660
Can I only have one person in the group?

1909
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:29,040
Can you only have one person in a group?

1910
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Is that true?

1911
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:33,700
I'm sorry.

1912
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:34,820
He's level 53.

1913
01:11:35,180 --> 01:11:35,700
Okay.

1914
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:37,120
See you later.

1915
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:42,440
You get four?

1916
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:43,240
Join.

1917
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:51,820
Oh, he left the team!

1918
01:11:52,540 --> 01:11:53,960
Oh my god!

1919
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:56,040
I'm sorry.

1920
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:00,780
Why can't he join my team?

1921
01:12:01,780 --> 01:12:03,060
Oh, okay.

1922
01:12:03,380 --> 01:12:04,060
Nice.

1923
01:12:04,180 --> 01:12:04,780
Join.

1924
01:12:07,820 --> 01:12:08,920
Don't worry, level 3.

1925
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,560
After Mr. Elite joins, then we'll be fine.

1926
01:12:14,620 --> 01:12:15,140
Join.

1927
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:17,880
You should... why aren't you joining?

1928
01:12:19,580 --> 01:12:21,240
He doesn't want to?

1929
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:24,040
Why don't you want to join my team?

1930
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:26,360
We're Team Doki Bird!

1931
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:27,500
Real female!

1932
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:30,240
Alright, you guys can just tag along then.

1933
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:31,460
Alright, guys.

1934
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:33,300
Okay, come with me.

1935
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:34,100
They're done.

1936
01:12:34,780 --> 01:12:35,880
I can't believe it.

1937
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:35,880
Bro!

1938
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:41,120
He's just like, I can't believe it.

1939
01:12:41,180 --> 01:12:43,460
I got ditched so fast.

1940
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,780
I can't believe it.

1941
01:12:51,620 --> 01:12:54,940
He's sitting there like, I can't believe it.

1942
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:59,460
He's so done already.

1943
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:03,940
It's okay, guys.

1944
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:09,820
They haven't yet made any untoward advances, but perhaps you could speak to them?

1945
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:13,100
Verify their intentions are civil?

1946
01:13:14,020 --> 01:13:14,660
Okay.

1947
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:16,700
He declined my invite!

1948
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,620
Have you seen the Overseer?

1949
01:13:21,820 --> 01:13:23,600
Well, yes, but it's been some time.

1950
01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:25,860
Also, I brought the volume overall sound guy.

1951
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:26,840
But she was a resourceful woman.

1952
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:28,520
I'm sure she's alright.

1953
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:30,920
Alright.

1954
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:32,820
So what's been going on out there?

1955
01:13:32,820 --> 01:13:35,080
Recently, it's been exceedingly peaceful.

1956
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,220
I maintained my post.

1957
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:38,440
I can't believe it.

1958
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:40,040
Bro's not gonna carry me.

1959
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:45,180
And otherwise reveled in Appalachia's natural splendor.

1960
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:49,360
But very recently, it seems people have come back to Appalachia.

1961
01:13:49,980 --> 01:13:52,000
Those two and more to boot.

1962
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:55,420
The non-vault sort, you understand.

1963
01:13:55,780 --> 01:13:56,780
The non-vault?

1964
01:13:56,780 --> 01:13:56,960
Oh.

1965
01:13:57,620 --> 01:14:00,040
I bet you it leads to the non-vault player.

1966
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:01,800
I bet you.

1967
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:04,400
He doesn't seem... he seems like a surface dweller.

1968
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:06,660
Rejecting my invite!

1969
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:17,840
Alright.

1970
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:24,420
I hope you're on my way.

1971
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:24,900
Alright, guys.

1972
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:25,320
Let's go.

1973
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:29,940
I can't believe you rejected my friend request.

1974
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:30,520
Alright.

1975
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:31,200
You know what?

1976
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:32,500
You know who would it?

1977
01:14:32,620 --> 01:14:35,180
The person that was there in the very beginning.

1978
01:14:39,380 --> 01:14:42,660
They didn't reject my friend request.

1979
01:14:47,580 --> 01:14:49,420
How dare you.

1980
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:54,080
How fucking dare you.

1981
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:57,120
Anyway, let's actually play this game.

1982
01:14:57,380 --> 01:14:58,500
Oh, donation box!

1983
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:00,520
Oh!

1984
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:03,160
I want a donation.

1985
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:04,820
What's this?

1986
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:06,420
Okay.

1987
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:08,280
I'll need this.

1988
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:08,880
I'll need that.

1989
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:09,900
Guys!

1990
01:15:10,220 --> 01:15:11,360
Donate to the poor!

1991
01:15:11,620 --> 01:15:12,300
I'm poor.

1992
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:17,720
Who are you?

1993
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:18,700
Are you a surface dweller?

1994
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:20,360
Are you a surface?

1995
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:21,340
Surface-y?

1996
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:22,540
Surf-y?

1997
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:25,860
Is the door still open?

1998
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:28,880
Door's still tight.

1999
01:15:28,940 --> 01:15:29,840
No one's getting in.

2000
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:32,680
God damn it.

2001
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:35,740
We got a tip for the world.

2002
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:36,080
Alright, dad.

2003
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:36,740
I'm poor.

2004
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:44,620
So this guy told us that after you gave him the last of our caps.

2005
01:15:45,820 --> 01:15:46,440
He's a...

2006
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:49,180
He declined my team invite too!

2007
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:50,980
Which were the big ones.

2008
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:54,020
Our last chance to turn our lousy luck around.

2009
01:15:54,660 --> 01:15:55,800
Oh my god!

2010
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:59,000
The level three turned down my team invite!

2011
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:02,960
Wait.

2012
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:04,020
The big one?

2013
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:04,780
What are you talking about?

2014
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:06,640
The thing that brought everyone back.

2015
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:08,420
The treasure.

2016
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:09,520
The treasure?

2017
01:16:09,820 --> 01:16:11,120
There's a treasure here?

2018
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:11,940
Well, yeah.

2019
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:14,380
There was this big broadcast, but...

2020
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:16,440
Permission to join you.

2021
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:18,380
I'm super high level trust.

2022
01:16:18,780 --> 01:16:20,020
Oh, my boy.

2023
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:21,620
I think you were super trusting.

2024
01:16:21,620 --> 01:16:22,200
Thank you.

2025
01:16:22,660 --> 01:16:23,300
But...

2026
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:25,500
Those were the last of our caps.

2027
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:26,520
No.

2028
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:28,540
Someone has to know something.

2029
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,160
We're just gonna stick it out until we find them.

2030
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:33,960
Wonderful.

2031
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:36,680
What's the treasure?

2032
01:16:39,580 --> 01:16:40,440
This is...

2033
01:16:40,980 --> 01:16:43,860
This is what happens when we take people for Granadoge.

2034
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:44,760
Me?

2035
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:46,860
Guys!

2036
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:48,440
Is this like...

2037
01:16:51,580 --> 01:16:52,060
No!

2038
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:55,220
Is this the one day I learned my lesson?

2039
01:16:58,540 --> 01:17:00,340
You won't have a spare weapon would you?

2040
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:01,800
Yeah.

2041
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:02,600
I don't have a weapon.

2042
01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:04,080
None at all.

2043
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:08,020
Wait.

2044
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:09,360
What else can you tell...

2045
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:10,520
Oh, I got a machete!

2046
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:12,280
What else can you tell me about the treasure?

2047
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:20,140
There's a consequences of my own action?

2048
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:21,900
We don't know what.

2049
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:22,920
We don't know where.

2050
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:25,340
People is desperate as they are.

2051
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:36,200
What the fuck?

2052
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:40,780
If you're gonna talk, be immersive.

2053
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:45,640
Okay, so what is the world like out there?

2054
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:48,700
Oh my god, you're from Virginia?

2055
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:50,120
Where am I?

2056
01:17:50,260 --> 01:17:51,460
What state am I in?

2057
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,200
The voices, do you hear the voices?

2058
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:58,080
I mean, Appalachia's dangerous.

2059
01:17:58,320 --> 01:17:59,320
Really dangerous.

2060
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:01,300
But it's better than where we've been.

2061
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:04,060
Alright, I better be going.

2062
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:05,660
I found out you're from Virginia.

2063
01:18:05,820 --> 01:18:06,760
I have to leave now.

2064
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:08,000
Oh my god!

2065
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:11,800
That seems like enough I can take.

2066
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:13,180
Oh my god!

2067
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:15,320
Look at all these kind donations!

2068
01:18:16,740 --> 01:18:18,640
Oh my god, everybody!

2069
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:21,800
Everybody's so kind to donate!

2070
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:25,320
The random strangers that donate!

2071
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:26,120
Donated to me!

2072
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:27,400
Thank you!

2073
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:29,680
I have a gun now!

2074
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:31,700
Look, pew pew!

2075
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:35,940
West Virginia!

2076
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:40,360
We're monsters.

2077
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:41,000
Is that a monster?

2078
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:41,940
Shoot!

2079
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:42,620
Shoot him!

2080
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:44,640
Go Mr. Elite!

2081
01:18:44,780 --> 01:18:45,020
Go!

2082
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:47,240
Yeah!

2083
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:51,440
Oh, there's our ghouls!

2084
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:51,980
Go!

2085
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:52,880
Go go go!

2086
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:54,180
Oh my god, Jazz!

2087
01:18:54,180 --> 01:18:56,520
My army is growing!

2088
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:57,760
Oh no.

2089
01:18:58,040 --> 01:18:59,020
Guys, it's okay.

2090
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:00,680
Overcome or what?

2091
01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:01,980
Running will drain AP.

2092
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:02,780
What's AP?

2093
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:05,620
What's AP?

2094
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:08,500
Is that AP stamina?

2095
01:19:09,660 --> 01:19:10,800
Oh, it's stamina.

2096
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,480
I'm a summoner class!

2097
01:19:13,780 --> 01:19:15,100
Visit the wayward.

2098
01:19:15,220 --> 01:19:16,040
Okay, where do we go?

2099
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:17,720
Okay, we're gonna visit the wayward, guys.

2100
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:18,900
Okay.

2101
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:20,600
How do I pin it?

2102
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:22,080
Place marker.

2103
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:22,940
Right here.

2104
01:19:23,140 --> 01:19:23,880
There you go.

2105
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:25,620
Toggle active.

2106
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:26,400
Okay.

2107
01:19:26,660 --> 01:19:28,640
Where the fuck is my compass?

2108
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:36,520
I don't know why I'm heading the right way.

2109
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:38,440
Anyway.

2110
01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:43,210
My mage.

2111
01:19:43,410 --> 01:19:43,890
Go!

2112
01:19:44,350 --> 01:19:45,030
My...

2113
01:19:45,750 --> 01:19:46,430
Go!

2114
01:19:46,570 --> 01:19:47,610
It's like Pokemon!

2115
01:19:47,710 --> 01:19:49,170
I'm like the Pokemon trainer.

2116
01:19:49,610 --> 01:19:50,930
Guys, I don't understand.

2117
01:19:51,150 --> 01:19:52,210
MMOs are so easy.

2118
01:19:55,790 --> 01:19:57,110
Oh, I see it!

2119
01:19:57,130 --> 01:19:57,730
It's the bottom!

2120
01:19:57,830 --> 01:19:58,570
I see it!

2121
01:19:58,890 --> 01:20:00,670
Sorry, gamers don't look down.

2122
01:20:01,150 --> 01:20:01,710
Either.

2123
01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:04,290
Oh my god.

2124
01:20:04,350 --> 01:20:08,150
The Doki Bird Fallout 76 experience.

2125
01:20:08,750 --> 01:20:10,990
Bro is playing Power Up.

2126
01:20:11,150 --> 01:20:12,010
Oh my god!

2127
01:20:12,130 --> 01:20:14,650
Look at all these things I found!

2128
01:20:15,630 --> 01:20:16,190
Oh!

2129
01:20:16,550 --> 01:20:17,650
Is this like...

2130
01:20:17,650 --> 01:20:18,950
I can have a mask on!

2131
01:20:19,270 --> 01:20:20,850
I can have a uniform!

2132
01:20:21,090 --> 01:20:22,750
I can have an umbrella hat!

2133
01:20:23,110 --> 01:20:24,570
Okay, I'm gonna have like this.

2134
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:26,910
And then I'm gonna...

2135
01:20:26,910 --> 01:20:29,610
Okay, I'm gonna have this clothes on.

2136
01:20:29,830 --> 01:20:30,570
Because I can.

2137
01:20:31,030 --> 01:20:32,270
And then...

2138
01:20:32,270 --> 01:20:33,250
There you go.

2139
01:20:33,650 --> 01:20:34,310
Guys!

2140
01:20:34,310 --> 01:20:34,830
Look!

2141
01:20:38,230 --> 01:20:39,630
I'm not gonna have that.

2142
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:43,190
Okay.

2143
01:20:43,470 --> 01:20:44,470
Oh my god!

2144
01:20:44,510 --> 01:20:46,050
He has a battle armor!

2145
01:20:46,770 --> 01:20:48,090
Holy shit!

2146
01:20:49,390 --> 01:20:51,130
Oh my god!

2147
01:20:56,530 --> 01:20:57,250
Dude!

2148
01:21:00,020 --> 01:21:02,160
Can I be in the battle armor?

2149
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:04,340
Can I...

2150
01:21:04,340 --> 01:21:05,340
Can I go inside?

2151
01:21:05,860 --> 01:21:07,080
Where did he go?

2152
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,780
The power armor!

2153
01:21:10,940 --> 01:21:12,080
Holy shit!

2154
01:21:12,580 --> 01:21:14,460
He's jumping so high!

2155
01:21:15,180 --> 01:21:16,880
Bro, what the fuck?

2156
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:17,700
He's disappeared!

2157
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:20,980
Oh my god!

2158
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:23,060
Bro...

2159
01:21:23,060 --> 01:21:25,280
Guys, I caught a level...

2160
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:29,400
Guys, I caught a level 255 Pokemon!

2161
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:35,780
Guys, look at that!

2162
01:21:35,980 --> 01:21:37,180
Oh my god!

2163
01:21:37,220 --> 01:21:37,640
Guys!

2164
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:40,120
I have so many Pokemans!

2165
01:21:43,420 --> 01:21:47,240
Oh my god!

2166
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:51,040
This game is already so good!

2167
01:21:51,510 --> 01:21:52,740
Wait, I went the wrong way.

2168
01:21:53,060 --> 01:21:53,840
It's like...

2169
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:54,980
No, that's people.

2170
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:57,120
I have to go to the house, right?

2171
01:21:57,720 --> 01:22:01,160
She got a Master Ball at the start.

2172
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:02,920
My Pokemans!

2173
01:22:04,860 --> 01:22:07,620
I knew being a real female...

2174
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:10,020
Doki was the trick.

2175
01:22:10,580 --> 01:22:11,440
I knew it.

2176
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:13,320
They saw the rare red head.

2177
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:18,740
Turn down the music a little bit.

2178
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:20,040
And then...

2179
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:20,940
Alright.

2180
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:23,860
Wait, are they killing that deer in front of me?

2181
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:24,720
I think...

2182
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:25,120
Okay.

2183
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:27,700
Music low a little bit.

2184
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:29,760
Effects a little bit higher.

2185
01:22:30,020 --> 01:22:30,240
Okay.

2186
01:22:30,980 --> 01:22:32,760
Alright, we should be good, I think.

2187
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:33,820
What did you do?

2188
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:35,080
Was that a deer?

2189
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:36,960
Oh my god!

2190
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:38,040
Okay.

2191
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:40,160
We gotta go this way.

2192
01:22:40,700 --> 01:22:41,220
E...

2193
01:22:41,220 --> 01:22:42,260
East.

2194
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:43,000
East.

2195
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:44,620
I think that's it.

2196
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:44,800
Yeah.

2197
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:45,460
Alright, guys.

2198
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:45,740
Let's go.

2199
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:48,500
I'm pretty...

2200
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:49,400
The Dokimons.

2201
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:50,240
Hahaha!

2202
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:51,040
Guys!

2203
01:22:51,260 --> 01:22:52,300
Where's your house?

2204
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:53,280
Guys!

2205
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:54,900
Wait, where's level 255?

2206
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,860
Where's the level 255 kid?

2207
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:59,040
I wanted that...

2208
01:22:59,040 --> 01:22:59,780
Where's your house?

2209
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:01,720
Where did he go?

2210
01:23:01,940 --> 01:23:02,700
He left?

2211
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:05,280
Guys, I had to release him like Butterfree.

2212
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:11,880
Guys, we had a...

2213
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:14,360
We had a Butterfree moment there.

2214
01:23:14,580 --> 01:23:15,640
And we had to...

2215
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:17,100
We had to release him...

2216
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:18,420
into the wild...

2217
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:19,640
to be with his people.

2218
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:20,640
Hahaha!

2219
01:23:20,860 --> 01:23:21,460
No!

2220
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:23,020
Not Butterfree!

2221
01:23:24,460 --> 01:23:26,100
Investigate the corpse...

2222
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:27,860
The public team leader?

2223
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:29,360
How does like...

2224
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:30,940
Why is he that special?

2225
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:32,060
Hahaha!

2226
01:23:34,020 --> 01:23:38,140
Why is he so special that he actually just shows up?

2227
01:23:38,540 --> 01:23:39,760
I like your hat.

2228
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:40,320
Thank you.

2229
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:41,320
I found it.

2230
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:45,020
See him in 20 plus years.

2231
01:23:45,460 --> 01:23:46,160
Hahaha!

2232
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:49,620
Look, we had a very emotional moment.

2233
01:23:51,380 --> 01:23:52,500
Oh, wait.

2234
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:53,680
I can join this team?

2235
01:23:57,260 --> 01:23:58,160
Carry me.

2236
01:23:58,340 --> 01:23:59,040
Wait, no.

2237
01:23:59,100 --> 01:23:59,520
That's not...

2238
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:00,140
No, not you.

2239
01:24:00,940 --> 01:24:01,500
Hahaha!

2240
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:02,520
No!

2241
01:24:02,820 --> 01:24:04,140
I can't!

2242
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:06,220
Wall-E, Walnut!

2243
01:24:07,340 --> 01:24:07,900
No!

2244
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,040
You have to...

2245
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:12,840
No, Doki.

2246
01:24:12,940 --> 01:24:15,020
You have to buy things from the Adam store.

2247
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:17,860
I thought Sun is going to die.

2248
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:19,840
I'm going to starve to death.

2249
01:24:19,980 --> 01:24:21,500
Thank you for the super chat.

2250
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:21,960
Cheers.

2251
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:22,480
Thank you.

2252
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:22,620
Thank you.

2253
01:24:22,620 --> 01:24:25,480
Oh my god.

2254
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:26,940
Not Todd's son.

2255
01:24:27,380 --> 01:24:27,940
Hahaha!

2256
01:24:28,740 --> 01:24:30,820
Why do I need that when...

2257
01:24:30,820 --> 01:24:33,920
When I have my Doki Mans to help me?

2258
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:36,380
It's okay.

2259
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:39,020
The Doki Mans will be here.

2260
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:40,720
Guys, I'm like encumbered.

2261
01:24:40,980 --> 01:24:41,540
Hahaha!

2262
01:24:41,860 --> 01:24:45,160
I like how you guys are like, Doki, just throw away your items.

2263
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:45,860
I'm...

2264
01:24:45,860 --> 01:24:46,000
No!

2265
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:47,760
I'm a hoarder!

2266
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:49,040
Hahaha!

2267
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:50,740
Wait, okay.

2268
01:24:50,860 --> 01:24:51,660
I need somebody...

2269
01:24:51,660 --> 01:24:52,500
My Doki Mans!

2270
01:24:53,100 --> 01:24:53,760
Doki Mans!

2271
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:55,900
I need somebody to carry my stuff, okay?

2272
01:24:56,380 --> 01:25:00,040
I'm going to drop some stuff and you guys got to carry it for me, alright guys?

2273
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:00,980
Alright.

2274
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:01,800
Uh...

2275
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:03,200
Okay, I'm going to drop...

2276
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:04,000
Okay, wait.

2277
01:25:04,060 --> 01:25:04,640
How do I drop?

2278
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:05,300
Uh...

2279
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:05,800
Oh, drop.

2280
01:25:06,060 --> 01:25:06,640
Alright, guys.

2281
01:25:06,780 --> 01:25:08,620
I need you guys to carry this.

2282
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:09,840
Alright?

2283
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:11,940
Okay, carry...

2284
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:12,460
Okay, Jazz.

2285
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:13,700
Alright, my Doki Mans.

2286
01:25:14,420 --> 01:25:14,900
Carry...

2287
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:16,660
I don't know why I have a cannonball.

2288
01:25:17,060 --> 01:25:17,540
Hahaha!

2289
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:18,500
Hahaha!

2290
01:25:19,220 --> 01:25:20,820
Carry the cannonball.

2291
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:22,200
Am I...

2292
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:22,600
Am I supposed to carry this?

2293
01:25:22,620 --> 01:25:23,240
Am I still encumbered?

2294
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:25,200
Okay, carry...

2295
01:25:25,780 --> 01:25:27,220
Carry my cannonballs, guys.

2296
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:29,420
Why are you guys shooting me?

2297
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:30,360
Oh, this is it!

2298
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:32,160
Guys, I need you guys to carry my cannonball!

2299
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:32,880
It's right here!

2300
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:34,720
Okay.

2301
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:36,020
Is this it?

2302
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:38,620
Oh, is this your house?

2303
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:40,460
Is this our house?

2304
01:25:41,420 --> 01:25:41,880
Oh, no.

2305
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:42,920
This is my house.

2306
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:43,920
Is it?

2307
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:45,120
Oh, it is...

2308
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:45,320
No.

2309
01:25:45,620 --> 01:25:45,980
Wait.

2310
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:46,780
No, it's not.

2311
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:47,820
Whose house is this?

2312
01:25:48,700 --> 01:25:49,420
Is this mine?

2313
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:51,960
Hahaha!

2314
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:52,600
Hahaha!

2315
01:25:53,820 --> 01:25:55,100
This is mine, right?

2316
01:25:55,860 --> 01:25:56,520
Oh, I...

2317
01:25:56,520 --> 01:25:58,000
Okay, I need to get rid of...

2318
01:25:58,600 --> 01:25:59,400
Wait, okay.

2319
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:00,820
Oh my God!

2320
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:02,560
The Brotherhood office suit?

2321
01:26:03,580 --> 01:26:04,040
Oh!

2322
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,600
Alright, I can put my stuff down here.

2323
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:08,740
Alright, we're gonna put away...

2324
01:26:08,740 --> 01:26:09,860
We're gonna put away this.

2325
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:11,700
Because I feel conflicted.

2326
01:26:11,940 --> 01:26:12,420
Hahaha!

2327
01:26:13,620 --> 01:26:17,060
When I had that on, I felt it was a bit wrong.

2328
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:17,960
Hahaha!

2329
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:20,040
Okay.

2330
01:26:20,260 --> 01:26:22,020
We're gonna put this in here.

2331
01:26:22,140 --> 01:26:22,580
And...

2332
01:26:22,580 --> 01:26:24,220
Oh my God, a fusion core?

2333
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:26,120
What am I going to do with a fusion core?

2334
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:27,640
Um...

2335
01:26:29,220 --> 01:26:31,280
Oh my God, there's Salisbury steak!

2336
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:33,040
Oh!

2337
01:26:33,620 --> 01:26:34,980
Okay, I'm gonna put this away.

2338
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:36,680
Uh...

2339
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:38,100
And then...

2340
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:38,300
No!

2341
01:26:38,380 --> 01:26:40,100
We have so many good items!

2342
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:42,120
We can't store all of them away.

2343
01:26:43,540 --> 01:26:44,400
Oh my God.

2344
01:26:44,420 --> 01:26:45,500
Okay, we're gonna put away the glasses.

2345
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:47,840
We're gonna put away...

2346
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:50,300
Oh, but this one has a heart, so it's better.

2347
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:51,580
And then...

2348
01:26:51,580 --> 01:26:51,840
Hahaha!

2349
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:53,640
We put away the concrete.

2350
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:55,880
Because we definitely don't need the concrete.

2351
01:26:56,300 --> 01:26:57,320
Guys, it's good.

2352
01:26:57,500 --> 01:26:58,360
Okay, let's see.

2353
01:27:00,180 --> 01:27:01,140
Weapons, armor...

2354
01:27:01,140 --> 01:27:04,500
Wait, I wanna wear the Brotherhood officer suit.

2355
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:05,300
Ooh, nice.

2356
01:27:05,540 --> 01:27:05,800
Okay.

2357
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,620
Guys, do I look good?

2358
01:27:09,740 --> 01:27:11,300
Guys, oh, cores are for battle.

2359
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,220
I don't have a battle.

2360
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:13,440
Is this mine?

2361
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:17,360
Is this mine?

2362
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:19,740
Join the public team?

2363
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:21,200
I'll join your team.

2364
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:24,880

01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:26,540

01:27:26,540 --> 01:27:29,820
Who are these other random people?

2367
01:27:35,700 --> 01:27:38,040
Who the... what the fuck?

2368
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:39,380
Oh my god, I got adopted.

2369
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:42,040
Guys, I got adopted.

2370
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:47,460
My new... my new leader.

2371
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:49,640
Oh my god.

2372
01:27:49,740 --> 01:27:50,980

2373
01:27:50,980 --> 01:27:53,820
Are you... oh my god, hey.

2374
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:55,900
Are you a dragoon?

2375
01:27:58,260 --> 01:27:59,080
What is it?

2376
01:27:59,200 --> 01:27:59,560
Oh.

2377
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,480

2378
01:28:07,940 --> 01:28:08,660
Hello.

Oh, a sim pack.

2380
01:28:11,260 --> 01:28:12,020
My god.

2381
01:28:12,980 --> 01:28:15,460
Guys, look at my po... documents.

2382
01:28:19,420 --> 01:28:20,960
What the fuck?

2383
01:28:20,980 --> 01:28:22,360
My documents.

2384
01:28:25,340 --> 01:28:26,780
That's so stupid.

2385
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:29,860
How did I have like more stuff?

2386
01:28:30,020 --> 01:28:31,320
Guys, I need to throw away stuff.

2387
01:28:31,620 --> 01:28:33,320
I'm still in Coombered right now.

2388
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:34,860
Give me a sec.

2389
01:28:35,080 --> 01:28:38,640
I keep throwing away things and end up getting more.

2390
01:28:39,460 --> 01:28:41,280
Like, how is this possible?

2391
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:43,240
Oh!

2392
01:28:44,780 --> 01:28:45,380
Mine!

2393
01:28:46,180 --> 01:28:47,080
Wait, no.

2394
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:49,240
Not mine?

2395
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:50,000
No!

2396
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,620
I put a fusion core in there!

2397
01:28:52,310 --> 01:28:54,180
Somebody take my fusion core out!

2398
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:55,980
I'm too low level!

2399
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:02,900
Somebody!

2400
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:10,980
Somebody take my fusion core out!

2401
01:29:13,290 --> 01:29:13,620
Oh!

2404
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:19,360
No.

2405
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:19,980
Mine?

2406
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Am I going inside?

2407
01:29:25,710 --> 01:29:27,510
I'm just like you guys!

2408
01:29:28,670 --> 01:29:30,190

Guys, look at me.

2410
01:29:33,370 --> 01:29:34,410
Look at me.

2412
01:29:40,810 --> 01:29:41,170
My...

2413
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:42,850
Can I move in this?

2414
01:29:43,070 --> 01:29:44,650
I look so cool, guys.

2415
01:29:45,150 --> 01:29:46,530
Oh my god.

2416
01:29:46,650 --> 01:29:48,590

2417
01:29:48,730 --> 01:29:49,850
Just like them.

2418
01:29:51,490 --> 01:29:52,790
Just the best.

2419
01:29:54,150 --> 01:29:54,970
Why is...

2420
01:29:54,970 --> 01:29:57,410
Why is it beeping though?

2421
01:29:57,670 --> 01:29:59,790
Is it because like I have...

2422
01:29:59,790 --> 01:30:00,510
I have no core?

2423
01:30:00,730 --> 01:30:02,270
Guys, can someone put a core in me?

2424
01:30:02,570 --> 01:30:05,250
Can someone put a fusion core in me?

2425
01:30:05,990 --> 01:30:07,090
Oh, is it right here?

2426
01:30:07,410 --> 01:30:07,770
Oh!

01:30:08,150 --> 01:30:08,670
Nice!

2428
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:14,820
Guys, I'm so cool now.

2429
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:16,600
Oh my god!

2430
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:17,760
I'm so fucking cool.

2431
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:20,940
I can't believe this game would actually be hard.

2432
01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:24,020
Holy shit, look, there's cows!

2433
01:30:24,060 --> 01:30:24,240
Ah, cow, cow, cow!

2434
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:25,020
Guys!

2435
01:30:25,020 --> 01:30:26,480
I can milk the cow?

2436
01:30:27,860 --> 01:30:28,380
Guys!

2437
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:31,580
Oh my god, wait, I gotta milk the cow.

2438
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:33,760
Guys!

2439
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:35,660
You can milk the cows!

2440
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:41,440
Oh my god, the mutant cows!

2441
01:30:42,140 --> 01:30:43,860
Why is it- it's cause there's radiation!

2442
01:30:45,980 --> 01:30:46,500
Snake!

2443
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:49,460
No, none of this in this world is perfectly okay!

2444
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:53,380
They don't even have fur!

2445
01:30:53,980 --> 01:30:57,280
The first thing you say is why does it have two heads?

2446
01:30:57,540 --> 01:30:59,200
Why does it not have fur?

2447
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:01,920
Can I shoot it?

2448
01:31:02,140 --> 01:31:03,440
Guys, can I kill the cows?

2449
01:31:06,660 --> 01:31:07,460
Kill the cows!

2450
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:11,640
Doki Man, kill this one cow!

2451
01:31:16,740 --> 01:31:17,220
Yes!

2452
01:31:21,020 --> 01:31:22,640
Wait, not all of them!

2453
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:25,040
Guys, not all the cows!

2454
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:28,260
Oh my god, who's Bessie?

2455
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:30,820
Who the fuck is Bessie?

2456
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:33,780
Holy shit.

2457
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:36,880
Guys, don't- guys, I made a mistake, guys!

2458
01:31:37,140 --> 01:31:38,740
I made a mistake!

2459
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:44,040
Oh my god, Bessie!

2460
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:51,480
Guys!

2461
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:52,180
Guys!

2462
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:55,960
Don't kill the cows!

2463
01:31:56,360 --> 01:31:58,760
Don't kill the cows, guys!

2464
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:03,360
A private area is- only you and your teammates can be in this interior.

2465
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:06,220
Okay, make important story choices.

2466
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:08,040
Alright, okay, let's actually start the game.

2467
01:32:08,360 --> 01:32:09,160
Let's start-

2468
01:32:13,740 --> 01:32:15,180
Let's actually play the game.

2469
01:32:15,620 --> 01:32:16,100
Whoa!

2470
01:32:16,700 --> 01:32:19,100
Lady, I will paint the walls with you if you don't tell me- Whoa!

2471
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:23,160
Honey, you picked the wrong time to get a drink.

2472
01:32:23,660 --> 01:32:24,420
What are you- hey!

2473
01:32:24,620 --> 01:32:25,580
Who the hell are you?

2474
01:32:25,940 --> 01:32:26,520
I'm me!

2475
01:32:26,820 --> 01:32:28,700
I'm- I'm real female Doki.

2476
01:32:29,620 --> 01:32:33,040
I'm the last thing you're ever- wait, what's going on here first?

2477
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:35,180
None of your damn business!

2478
01:32:35,580 --> 01:32:40,740
What's going on is that this one seems to think I know where this big treasure is.

2479
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:42,700
Oh, they're talking about the treasure!

2480
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:44,180
And I'm letting my people out of refuse for fun.

2481
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:46,420
Lady, this is your last warning.

2482
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:48,140
Our crew is getting that treasure.

2483
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:55,280
And I will happily send you both to the great goddamn beyond if you don't start explaining where I can find what's ours!

2484
01:32:56,380 --> 01:32:58,060
Are you- suit yourself.

2485
01:32:58,320 --> 01:32:59,300
Tell me about this treasure.

2486
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:00,740
Maybe you can work something out.

2487
01:33:01,640 --> 01:33:03,980
Treasures are crew's business, not yours.

2488
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:08,080
And unless I start getting answers right now, I'm gonna start shooting people.

2489
01:33:08,640 --> 01:33:10,320
You don't wanna do that!

2490
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:13,280
Tell him- just tell him what he knows so we can suit yourself!

2491
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:14,400
Don't worry, I'll make it quick!

2492
01:33:14,700 --> 01:33:16,080
I have a gun!

2493
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:17,020
No, no, no!

2494
01:33:17,640 --> 01:33:18,480
Oh, wait!

2495
01:33:18,540 --> 01:33:19,500
There's more than one person!

2496
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:19,940
It's okay!

2497
01:33:20,580 --> 01:33:21,220
Oh, wait!

2498
01:33:21,300 --> 01:33:22,240
Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry.

2499
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:24,680
That's fucking right.

2500
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:27,200
You didn't expect me to have a gun also!

2501
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:29,080
I could have been more than enough for one day.

2502
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:32,220
I accidentally shot her, but it's okay.

2503
01:33:33,740 --> 01:33:36,840
Well, not exactly the introduction to the wayward island of the forest.

2504
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:37,840
Thank god you don't miss!

2505
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:39,900
I'll say about that, darling.

2506
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:41,900
First round's on me.

2507
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:43,620
Name's Duchess.

2508
01:33:44,120 --> 01:33:45,500
There's something I could do for you.

2509
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:47,000
Oh, wait!

2510
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:47,000
There's more than one person!

2511
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:47,000
It's okay!

2512
01:33:47,020 --> 01:33:48,220
Oh, so what was that about?

2513
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:50,660
Your guess is as good as mine, sweetheart.

2514
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:55,240
He busted in here saying I needed to turn over the location of some fellow named Crane.

2515
01:33:55,420 --> 01:33:57,920
Who I guess I must have served at some point or another.

2516
01:33:58,160 --> 01:34:03,260
Since then, a steady stream of miscreants has been making my life irritating.

2517
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:06,900
Not exactly good for a buddin' business.

2518
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:10,120
So anyways, she's starting in blasting.

2519
01:34:11,220 --> 01:34:13,380
So, um, looking for the Overseer.

2520
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:14,120
Have you seen her?

2521
01:34:14,940 --> 01:34:15,620
Overseer, huh?

2522
01:34:15,620 --> 01:34:18,000
So you must be the one.

2523
01:34:18,140 --> 01:34:18,920
Yeah, it's me!

2524
01:34:19,540 --> 01:34:20,640
I'm the special one!

2525
01:34:20,740 --> 01:34:21,460
I haven't seen her, but I have heard her.

2526
01:34:21,620 --> 01:34:25,820
My people found the kitchen and I know where the well-understood camp across the valley is.

2527
01:34:25,820 --> 01:34:26,640
Thank you, Super Chat!

2528
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:27,080
Thank you!

2529
01:34:27,380 --> 01:34:28,740
She's a bit out of date now.

2530
01:34:30,260 --> 01:34:32,500
Maybe you're the one she left it for.

2531
01:34:32,820 --> 01:34:33,740
Yeah, hmm!

2532
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,660
Only me, because I'm special!

2533
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:39,180
We've drifted naturally onto the topic of helping one another.

2534
01:34:39,700 --> 01:34:42,820
Maybe there's something you could do for me in return.

2535
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:44,600
What do you want?

2536
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:49,620
And you'll give me the Overseer's statement in exchange for... what exactly?

2537
01:34:50,100 --> 01:34:54,520
Just agreeing to lend us a hand in a little... diplomatic intervention.

2538
01:34:56,780 --> 01:34:57,300
See?

2539
01:34:57,300 --> 01:34:58,920
That boy you put down.

2540
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:01,880
He's not the first of his crew to roll in here.

2541
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:02,280
Oh yeah?

2542
01:35:02,460 --> 01:35:04,120
I have my own crew.

2543
01:35:04,620 --> 01:35:07,180
Normally, I'd send my people out to clean house.

2544
01:35:07,540 --> 01:35:11,840
But my muscles run off, so I don't have the bodies to spare right now.

2545
01:35:12,680 --> 01:35:13,480
Don't worry.

2546
01:35:13,740 --> 01:35:15,600
I have a lot of money.

2547
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:16,760
You don't have those bodies to spare.

2548
01:35:17,820 --> 01:35:18,380
Please.

2549
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:21,640
Alright.

2550
01:35:21,820 --> 01:35:22,780
I'll help you.

2551
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:27,080
I don't even need to know what you need help with.

2552
01:35:27,220 --> 01:35:28,520
I have the Dokemens.

2553
01:35:28,940 --> 01:35:30,340
The Dokemons.

2554
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:31,120
Alright.

2555
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:32,840
So.

2556
01:35:33,420 --> 01:35:34,340
The details.

2557
01:35:34,700 --> 01:35:35,220
Yeah?

2558
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:35,840
Now.

2559
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:39,100
Each of these boys came in asking after Crane.

2560
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:41,600
I'm thinking we could make that work for us.

2561
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:45,520
How would you grab the attention of a bunch of single minded thugs?

2562
01:35:45,540 --> 01:35:45,580
Yeah...

2563
01:35:47,380 --> 01:35:47,780
Alright.

2564
01:35:48,900 --> 01:35:49,300
Meditation?

2565
01:35:49,660 --> 01:35:50,040
Maybe.

2566
01:35:50,220 --> 01:35:52,000
That's what my mom did for my birthday party.

2567
01:35:52,100 --> 01:35:53,320
Though I guess no one came...

2568
01:35:53,320 --> 01:35:54,520
Oh my god, I'm a loser.

2569
01:35:54,860 --> 01:35:56,420
You want me to pretend to be Crane?

2570
01:35:57,060 --> 01:35:58,260
That's always got people.

2571
01:35:58,520 --> 01:36:00,120
My time, just say what you want.

2572
01:36:00,220 --> 01:36:00,440
Okay.

2573
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:02,180
You want me to pretend to be...

2574
01:36:02,180 --> 01:36:04,040
Oh, I have Intelligence 2+.

2575
01:36:04,700 --> 01:36:05,100
I am!

2576
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:07,920
I'm so smart!

2577
01:36:16,120 --> 01:36:21,500
My level 255 Wall-E walnut is like I got a Master Ball and I caught a level...

2578
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:25,960
like a level 50 Legendary while I'm like level...

2579
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:28,320
while I just got out of Pallet Town.

2580
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,040
I'm smart!

2581
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:39,400
Ooh!

2582
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:49,860
It's got a little system built in that'll make sending out an advertisement...

2583
01:36:49,860 --> 01:36:52,740
and getting this gang's attention a snap.

2584
01:36:54,420 --> 01:37:00,300
You just need to build it, use the tape it spits out to tell the world you're open for business...

2585
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:04,720
and then convince any punks that show up to tell you where their boss is hiding.

2586
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:09,040
They did teach you all how to build from schematics up in that vault of yours.

2587
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:09,560
Yeah!

2588
01:37:09,720 --> 01:37:10,640
They did!

2589
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:11,400
They did!

2590
01:37:11,580 --> 01:37:13,800
And even if they didn't, don't worry.

2591
01:37:14,020 --> 01:37:14,960
Someone must...

2592
01:37:15,780 --> 01:37:17,440
Someone in my army knows.

2593
01:37:17,980 --> 01:37:19,520
It's called outsourcing.

2594
01:37:19,660 --> 01:37:20,800
It's called delegating.

2595
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:24,440
I'm not here to get my hands dirty.

2596
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:25,960
I'm here to delegate.

2597
01:37:26,900 --> 01:37:27,300
Alright.

2598
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:28,640
I know how to build structures.

2599
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:29,820
I can do that.

2600
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:33,680
Mike!

2601
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:35,140
Thank you for the gift and shit!

2602
01:37:35,300 --> 01:37:35,440
Thank you!

2603
01:37:39,620 --> 01:37:40,420
He's a ghoul!

2604
01:37:50,540 --> 01:37:51,080
Alright.

2605
01:37:51,220 --> 01:37:52,020
I'll talk to him.

2606
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:01,040
Wait.

2607
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:02,580
Am I hungry right now?

2608
01:38:02,780 --> 01:38:04,360
I haven't eaten anything yet.

2609
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:12,800
Bonus intelligence.

2610
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:17,100
You need to learn something while you do it.

2611
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:19,560
Okay.

2612
01:38:19,820 --> 01:38:21,820
Are you ready to get this show on the road?

2613
01:38:22,060 --> 01:38:22,520
Yeah!

2614
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:23,640
Let's do this!

2615
01:38:24,180 --> 01:38:24,200
Hot dog.

2616
01:38:24,460 --> 01:38:27,540
It would be good to have those dolts off our back at long last.

2617
01:38:27,540 --> 01:38:27,820
Alright.

2618
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:29,760
I'm pretty sure I can get rid of them in like one second.

2619
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:32,800
Wait.

2620
01:38:33,060 --> 01:38:38,080
Can I like just send my people out to like do it now while I'm in this conversation?

2621
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:40,360
Oh!

2622
01:38:40,540 --> 01:38:41,000
Money!

2623
01:38:41,940 --> 01:38:43,160
I have money!

2624
01:38:44,420 --> 01:38:44,900
Money!

2625
01:38:44,900 --> 01:38:45,520
I have money!

2626
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:48,840
Money!

2627
01:39:05,980 --> 01:39:07,400
What do you have?

2628
01:39:07,620 --> 01:39:07,960
Kaz?

2629
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:10,160
What hape- Oh my god!

2630
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:11,760
Can I be that rude?

2631
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:11,900
Rude.

2632
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:15,540
You look like shit.

2633
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:16,920
What happened to you?

2634
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:21,220
Yeah, what happened?

2635
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:28,360
Outside?

2636
01:39:57,980 --> 01:39:59,900
What the fuck?

2637
01:40:00,200 --> 01:40:00,900
How?

2638
01:40:14,740 --> 01:40:15,980
Oh my god!

2639
01:40:16,180 --> 01:40:18,080
That's crazy that he survived that.

2640
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:24,580
I don't know what I clicked.

2641
01:40:29,660 --> 01:40:30,560
You know what?

2642
01:40:30,940 --> 01:40:31,900
And what's that?

2643
01:40:42,980 --> 01:40:47,420
I don't know.

2644
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:05,560
Okay.

2645
01:41:12,680 --> 01:41:14,000
Try to listen to them.

2646
01:41:14,140 --> 01:41:15,140
I'll do the thing.

2647
01:41:21,480 --> 01:41:22,080
Okay.

2648
01:41:25,460 --> 01:41:27,640
Uh, what's it like being a ghoul?

2649
01:41:42,460 --> 01:41:44,280
Oh my god, guys, I got a mixtape.

2650
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:55,900
Yeah, the Pharaoh ones that I killed.

2651
01:41:55,900 --> 01:41:58,400
Why some ghouls lose their minds and others don't.

2652
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:07,360
But ever since I turned, there's always this nagging feeling just at the back of my mind that I will have to feast on humans!

2653
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:09,060
Ha ha ha!

2654
01:42:09,580 --> 01:42:10,180
Seriously?

2655
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:11,320
Nothing?

2656
01:42:11,580 --> 01:42:12,160
Shit.

2657
01:42:12,280 --> 01:42:13,240
I thought it was funny.

2658
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:15,940
I thought it was funny!

2659
01:42:16,460 --> 01:42:18,900
Can't say I'd recommend it as a lifestyle choice.

2660
01:42:21,780 --> 01:42:22,380
Okay.

2661
01:42:22,380 --> 01:42:24,420
So what's your job here anyway?

2662
01:42:24,780 --> 01:42:25,520
Don't have one.

2663
01:42:25,900 --> 01:42:27,200
I'm an independent operator.

2664
01:42:27,480 --> 01:42:29,880
When these folks need a hand or got narrowed down into radiation, they come to me.

2665
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:30,660
Not like me though, guys.

2666
01:42:31,260 --> 01:42:32,100
I'm a leader.

2667
01:42:32,820 --> 01:42:33,260
Reds?

2668
01:42:33,260 --> 01:42:35,220
They don't bother me anymore.

2669
01:42:35,560 --> 01:42:37,680
In exchange, Dutchess lets me drink.

2670
01:42:37,780 --> 01:42:39,580
Doesn't bother me too much about my tab.

2671
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:40,280
Really?

2672
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:43,340
About the best sort of setup a guy in my situation can ever have.

2673
01:42:43,340 --> 01:42:44,440
No, not like me!

2674
01:42:44,700 --> 01:42:45,660
I'm a leader!

2675
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:46,560
All of these people can take the tapes take off.

2676
01:42:46,580 --> 01:42:47,840
It's me and my dokimans!

2677
01:42:49,680 --> 01:42:50,120
Okay.

2678
01:42:50,420 --> 01:42:51,420
Some other time then.

2679
01:42:52,020 --> 01:42:52,980
I'm the CEO.

2680
01:42:53,780 --> 01:42:54,220
Alright.

2681
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:55,780
Oh, they gave me a gun too.

2682
01:42:55,900 --> 01:42:56,740
And some corn!

2683
01:42:57,560 --> 01:43:00,180
Alright, we're gonna have to hunt her for hire.

2684
01:43:00,580 --> 01:43:01,380
Alright guys.

2685
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:02,540
It's time to kill.

2686
01:43:02,920 --> 01:43:05,800
We need to listen to the overseer's log.

2687
01:43:06,420 --> 01:43:06,900
Camp.

2688
01:43:07,080 --> 01:43:08,140
How do I listen to that log?

2689
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:09,580
Is it in data?

2690
01:43:12,280 --> 01:43:14,320
Listen to the overseer's log.

2691
01:43:15,180 --> 01:43:15,660
Radio?

2692
01:43:15,940 --> 01:43:16,380
Oh, there!

2693
01:43:18,580 --> 01:43:19,060
Ooh!

2694
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:22,460
This isn't a pirate radio.

2695
01:43:27,730 --> 01:43:30,450
Alright, let's listen to the music while we're here.

2696
01:43:31,190 --> 01:43:32,530
Is it in the items?

2697
01:43:32,850 --> 01:43:34,150
Where the fuck is the...

2698
01:43:35,030 --> 01:43:35,590
MISC?

2699
01:43:35,670 --> 01:43:36,610
Hold up.

2700
01:43:36,690 --> 01:43:36,870
Okay.

2701
01:43:40,950 --> 01:43:41,790
Overseer's log.

2702
01:43:42,090 --> 01:43:43,570
South of Vault 76.

2703
01:43:44,770 --> 01:43:48,070
I knew this wasn't going to be the Appalachia I remembered.

2704
01:43:48,350 --> 01:43:48,610
But...

2705
01:43:50,150 --> 01:43:51,070
Mutated animals?

2706
01:43:51,990 --> 01:43:52,870
Haywire bots?

2707
01:43:53,810 --> 01:43:56,340
So far.

2708
01:43:56,540 --> 01:43:58,020
I mean, there's people right here.

2709
01:43:58,280 --> 01:43:59,320
I'm ready to rebuild in the next few days.

2710
01:44:00,440 --> 01:44:02,460
What I can confirm is...

2711
01:44:05,560 --> 01:44:06,660
What do you mean?

2712
01:44:06,720 --> 01:44:07,700
It seems so nice.

2713
01:44:08,180 --> 01:44:09,120
Vault-Tec was prepared.

2714
01:44:12,040 --> 01:44:13,060
You see this?

2715
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:20,440
The cooking station, the stash box, the work benches, all built with the camp.

2716
01:44:21,160 --> 01:44:22,940
You need a home base out there.

2717
01:44:23,300 --> 01:44:27,660
The construction and assembly mobile platform is designed to give you one.

2718
01:44:28,180 --> 01:44:33,080
Just add resources, planning, and a little elbow grease.

2719
01:44:33,140 --> 01:44:33,880
There's no elbow grease.

2720
01:44:33,900 --> 01:44:34,780
There's no NPCs before it?

2721
01:44:34,820 --> 01:44:36,640
There was no NPCs?

2722
01:44:36,900 --> 01:44:38,860
You guys just didn't understand Todd's vision.

2723
01:44:40,940 --> 01:44:43,520
That's what people hated the most about MMOs.

2724
01:44:43,620 --> 01:44:45,360
There was no NPCs.

2725
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:49,520
I mean, there was too many NPCs.

2726
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:53,180
There was too many NPCs and MMOs.

2727
01:44:53,180 --> 01:44:55,280
So Todd knew what we wanted.

2728
01:44:55,680 --> 01:44:57,540
So Todd knew what we wanted.

2729
01:44:57,540 --> 01:44:57,800
So Todd knew what we wanted.

2730
01:44:57,840 --> 01:44:58,120
So Todd knew what we wanted.

2731
01:44:58,120 --> 01:44:58,760
It just works.

2732
01:44:58,820 --> 01:44:59,040
It just works.

2733
01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:03,700
I need to make sure every resident of 76 has a safe haven they can start from.

2734
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:03,860
I need to make sure every resident of 76 has a safe haven they can start from.

2735
01:45:07,100 --> 01:45:08,120
Alright.

2736
01:45:08,860 --> 01:45:11,940
I always feel like she stopped talking and then she kept going.

2737
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:18,080
Alright.

2738
01:45:18,140 --> 01:45:18,540
Nice.

2739
01:45:18,980 --> 01:45:20,540
Okay, let me...

2740
01:45:20,540 --> 01:45:24,140
Apparently, there's copyrighted music so I'll go with classical.

2741
01:45:25,940 --> 01:45:28,700
There's never any copyrighted classical music.

2742
01:45:31,980 --> 01:45:32,620
Alright.

2743
01:45:32,720 --> 01:45:36,480
We gotta go kill a camp.

2744
01:45:37,820 --> 01:45:38,980
I need to set up a camp.

2745
01:45:39,300 --> 01:45:41,620
Oh, I'm level 3 now, guys!

2746
01:45:41,680 --> 01:45:41,960
Look!

2747
01:45:42,040 --> 01:45:45,060
I don't know how I leveled up but look!

2748
01:45:46,200 --> 01:45:47,280
Hello, everybody.

2749
01:45:48,300 --> 01:45:49,400
Oh my...

2750
01:45:50,200 --> 01:45:52,200
What the fuck is...

2751
01:45:54,540 --> 01:45:55,140
Speech!

2752
01:45:55,740 --> 01:45:56,340
Speech!

2753
01:45:56,560 --> 01:45:57,120
Speech!

2754
01:45:57,820 --> 01:45:59,000
Hello, everybody.

2755
01:46:01,720 --> 01:46:02,920
Level 380?!

2756
01:46:02,920 --> 01:46:05,300
Oh my god!

2757
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:07,180
Oh my god!

2758
01:46:07,240 --> 01:46:07,620
Okay, there's...

2759
01:46:07,620 --> 01:46:08,380
I don't have PV.

2760
01:46:08,440 --> 01:46:09,160
Okay, I don't have PV.

2761
01:46:09,260 --> 01:46:09,840
I'm safe.

2762
01:46:10,100 --> 01:46:10,620
Alright.

2763
01:46:10,720 --> 01:46:10,960
Alright.

2764
01:46:11,060 --> 01:46:12,460
I'll give a speech, guys.

2765
01:46:12,720 --> 01:46:14,860
I'm gonna give a speech, everybody!

2766
01:46:17,860 --> 01:46:19,820
Welcome to the team!

2767
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:22,680
Welcome to the Dokimons team, everyone!

2768
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:25,920
I am very happy that...

2769
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:28,060
to have all of you here as my...

2770
01:46:28,060 --> 01:46:29,200
Oh my god!

2771
01:46:34,040 --> 01:46:35,980
Good job, everybody!

2772
01:46:36,520 --> 01:46:38,920
Now it's time to do a mission!

2773
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:42,260
We... There's no I in team!

2774
01:46:42,460 --> 01:46:45,880
But everybody remember that I get all...

2775
01:46:45,880 --> 01:46:47,880
99% of the credit.

2776
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:48,580
No, you know what?

2777
01:46:48,600 --> 01:46:48,760
No!

2778
01:46:48,920 --> 01:46:51,580
I get 100% of the credit!

2779
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:54,820
Just like my Oshii Thomas Edison!

2780
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:57,660
Because even... Just remember!

2781
01:46:58,080 --> 01:47:02,080
You're all doing this under the name of Doki Bird!

2782
01:47:02,420 --> 01:47:06,540
So everything you do has the honor of...

2783
01:47:07,300 --> 01:47:13,440
of taking... of having the credit taken by me, Doki Bird!

2784
01:47:13,740 --> 01:47:16,620
Because that is an honor!

2785
01:47:20,280 --> 01:47:20,860
Okay.

2786
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:24,660
No, we're not...

2787
01:47:24,660 --> 01:47:26,900
We don't need to visit the Atomic Shop!

2788
01:47:26,980 --> 01:47:28,960
We literally have an army!

2789
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:31,140
Okay.

2790
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:32,760
Where the fuck is he?

2791
01:47:34,760 --> 01:47:35,600
Wait, what?

2792
01:47:35,780 --> 01:47:36,620
Did my game crash?

2793
01:47:39,260 --> 01:47:39,840
What?

2794
01:47:39,900 --> 01:47:40,500
What happened?

2795
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:41,780
Oh my god!

2796
01:47:41,820 --> 01:47:42,240
That was scary!

2797
01:47:42,540 --> 01:47:43,920
Ha ha ha ha ha!

2798
01:47:45,320 --> 01:47:46,420
Where is he?

2799
01:47:47,300 --> 01:47:48,820
Where is the 100 foot higher?

2800
01:47:49,060 --> 01:47:50,360
Read the schematics... Oh!

2801
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:51,260

Where the fuck is the schematics?

2811
01:48:02,940 --> 01:48:03,920
What is it called?

2812
01:48:04,460 --> 01:48:05,260
Oh, notes?

2813
01:48:06,340 --> 01:48:07,680
Oh, there it is!

2814
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:10,740
Learn a recipe to craft.

2815
01:48:10,980 --> 01:48:11,640

01:48:11,780 --> 01:48:12,660
I'm okay still.

2817
01:48:13,370 --> 01:48:13,700
Alright.

01:48:18,120 --> 01:48:18,660
Guys!

2820
01:48:18,720 --> 01:48:20,620
Who has the best house?

2822
01:48:25,020 --> 01:48:27,860

01:48:29,680 --> 01:48:31,940
Show me your house, Lost Bud.

2825
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:33,620
Show house.

Ha ha ha ha ha!

2831
01:48:42,760 --> 01:48:44,460
I need to know where you live!

2832
01:48:44,920 --> 01:48:47,720
Show us where you live... What the fuck is that?

2833
01:48:48,720 --> 01:48:49,220
Alright.

2834
01:48:49,300 --> 01:48:50,000
Where do you live?

2835
01:48:50,180 --> 01:48:51,280
It has to be close, right?

2836
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:53,900
Alright.

2837
01:48:54,280 --> 01:48:55,700
We want to know where you live.

2838
01:48:55,960 --> 01:48:57,420
We're gonna crash your place.

2839
01:48:57,820 --> 01:48:59,480
Ha ha ha ha ha!

2840
01:49:00,720 --> 01:49:02,180

01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:06,300
Guys.

2844
01:49:06,420 --> 01:49:07,820
He's level 800 47.

2845
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:11,500
Clearly his house is pretty fucking sweet, guys.

2846
01:49:11,660 --> 01:49:14,140
We're gonna crash at his place.

2847
01:49:14,260 --> 01:49:15,580
Ha ha ha ha ha!

2848
01:49:15,580 --> 01:49:16,980
Ha ha ha ha ha!

2849
01:49:17,500 --> 01:49:18,060
Wait!

2850
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:19,420
There's a level 1000?

2851
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:21,620
Holy sh... Okay.

2852
01:49:21,680 --> 01:49:22,880
We're gonna go to your house next.

2853
01:49:23,060 --> 01:49:27,660
If your house is not as good as the level 1000, guys, I'm in...

2854
01:49:27,660 --> 01:49:28,220
Okay, guys.

01:52:29,280 --> 01:52:29,680
Oh!

2977
01:52:30,640 --> 01:52:33,560
I left the music in the background for this game.

2978
01:52:34,160 --> 01:52:34,940
Can't believe!

2979
01:52:35,320 --> 01:52:35,920
How did...

2980
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:37,480
Did these guys found me?

2981
01:52:37,780 --> 01:52:38,700
Or like...

2982
01:52:38,700 --> 01:52:41,920
Like, did they just like, kept queuing up until they got me?

2983
01:52:42,040 --> 01:52:42,760
Ha ha ha!

2984
01:52:42,760 --> 01:52:43,480
On the server?

2985
01:52:43,720 --> 01:52:44,260
Okay!

2986
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:46,060
Shoutout to that one...

2987
01:52:46,060 --> 01:52:50,680
Shoutout to that one dragoon that found... that was just waiting outside the vault.

2988
01:52:50,860 --> 01:52:53,220
They took their chances and it worked.

2989
01:52:53,380 --> 01:52:54,020
Ha ha ha ha!

2990
01:52:54,020 --> 01:52:54,020
Hey!

2991
01:52:54,780 --> 01:52:55,340
Ha ha ha ha!

2992
01:52:56,820 --> 01:52:58,140
Oh my god!

2993
01:52:58,180 --> 01:53:01,180
Look at all these... They're creating a pathway for me.

2994
01:53:01,540 --> 01:53:02,980
Ha ha ha ha!

2995
01:53:04,220 --> 01:53:05,480
Ha ha ha ha!

2996
01:53:05,480 --> 01:53:05,740
Ha ha ha ha!

2997
01:53:06,500 --> 01:53:07,840
Look at this!

2998
01:53:08,100 --> 01:53:10,560
Is this your house?

2999
01:53:11,560 --> 01:53:13,080
Is this your house?

3000
01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:14,560
Is this your house?

3001
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:16,680
What the fuck is going on?

3002
01:53:17,220 --> 01:53:17,320
What the fuck is going on?

3003
01:53:17,560 --> 01:53:18,860
I got money!

3004
01:53:20,100 --> 01:53:20,460
Nice!

3005
01:53:22,100 --> 01:53:23,520
Are these bad people?

3006
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:25,620
I like how like...

3007
01:53:25,620 --> 01:53:26,560
Ha ha ha ha!

3008
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:29,340
That was supposed to be like... enemies.

3009
01:53:29,680 --> 01:53:30,640
Ha ha ha ha!

3010
01:53:30,700 --> 01:53:35,060
I wonder if there's like actual non-dragoons here that are like...

3011
01:53:35,060 --> 01:53:36,020
What the fuck?

3012
01:53:36,340 --> 01:53:37,620
Ha ha ha ha!

3013
01:53:39,720 --> 01:53:40,360
Whoa!

3014
01:53:40,360 --> 01:53:41,900
He's a salesman!

3015
01:53:42,660 --> 01:53:44,400
Take off that jacket!

3016
01:53:45,340 --> 01:53:47,040
Wait, I can't even use it.

3017
01:53:47,080 --> 01:53:47,480
Oh, nice.

3018
01:53:47,960 --> 01:53:48,600
Okay.

3019
01:53:49,320 --> 01:53:50,220
Is this your house?

3020
01:53:51,140 --> 01:53:52,280
Oh my god!

3021
01:53:52,380 --> 01:53:53,680

01:54:00,460 --> 01:54:02,020
This is your house?

You even have like...

3028
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:06,480
I thought this was like part of the game!

3029
01:54:07,380 --> 01:54:08,660
Oh my god!

3030
01:54:08,700 --> 01:54:09,920

3031
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:12,380
What the fuck?

3032
01:54:12,580 --> 01:54:14,440
My best love songs...

3033
01:54:14,440 --> 01:54:15,620
Don't kill me!

3034
01:54:15,620 --> 01:54:16,520
That's crazy!

3035
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:17,020

Bro, he actually lives in the server!

3040
01:54:27,660 --> 01:54:28,800
Who are you?

3041
01:54:29,180 --> 01:54:30,300
Who are you?

3042
01:54:30,300 --> 01:54:31,240
Oh my god!

3043
01:54:31,260 --> 01:54:32,220

3044
01:54:32,220 --> 01:54:33,420
Oh my god!

3045
01:54:33,500 --> 01:54:35,180

3046
01:54:38,080 --> 01:54:39,640

Each server is different, right?

01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:50,580
Like, each server is different...

3055
01:54:50,580 --> 01:54:52,700
So we actually got into a server!

3056
01:54:54,220 --> 01:54:55,820
He has a wife!

3057

01:55:01,900 --> 01:55:04,960
The difference between surviving and thriving!

3061
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:07,760
We don't talk about that room!

3062
01:55:08,480 --> 01:55:08,880
We don't talk about that room!

3063
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:09,320
Wait, there's a...

3064
01:55:09,320 --> 01:55:11,260
That's like a secret door.

Literally nicer!

3066
01:55:13,540 --> 01:55:14,180

Oh my god, he has a basement too!

3074
01:55:27,700 --> 01:55:31,160
The post-apocalypse is very kind to him!

3075
01:55:31,320 --> 01:55:32,000
What's this?

3076
01:55:32,540 --> 01:55:34,300
I went into somebody's vault.

3077
01:55:34,660 --> 01:55:35,820
Is this his vault?

3078
01:55:36,740 --> 01:55:38,520

Why am I stuck?

3114
01:56:51,150 --> 01:56:53,010
Is it because somebody's already in the spa?

3115
01:56:53,350 --> 01:56:54,530
Oh thank god, okay.

3116
01:56:55,100 --> 01:56:56,890

Oh my honestly, 10 out of 10!

3164
01:58:37,670 --> 01:58:39,630
This is actually a sick crib bro!

3165
01:58:39,850 --> 01:58:42,550
This guy has his own vault!

3166
01:58:43,210 --> 01:58:45,890
He has his priorities right!

3167
01:58:46,650 --> 01:58:47,370
Hahaha!

3168
01:58:47,950 --> 01:58:49,910
What a fucking collection!

3169
01:58:50,530 --> 01:58:58,050
I think the most impressive thing is that we loaded into a server that has this person's home!

3170
01:58:58,330 --> 01:58:59,310
Like we...

3171
01:58:59,310 --> 01:59:00,270
Hahaha!

3172
01:59:00,710 --> 01:59:02,930
The house is the front!

3173
01:59:03,270 --> 01:59:04,590
Oh my god!

3174
01:59:04,730 --> 01:59:04,930
Alright!

3175
01:59:05,170 --> 01:59:06,710
Where is the level 1000?

3176
01:59:07,110 --> 01:59:07,650
Oh my god!

3177
01:59:07,670 --> 01:59:08,310
Alright!

3178
01:59:08,470 --> 01:59:09,390
Level 1000!

3179
01:59:09,830 --> 01:59:11,190
It's time to show your crib!

3180
01:59:11,470 --> 01:59:13,970
If it's not as good as that man's...

3181
01:59:13,970 --> 01:59:16,090
Then I would be so sad!

3182
01:59:16,630 --> 01:59:17,290
Give me some ammo!

3183
01:59:17,970 --> 01:59:18,490
Hahaha!

3184
01:59:19,570 --> 01:59:21,470
I need a salt rifle ammo!

3185
01:59:21,830 --> 01:59:22,350
Hahaha!

3186
01:59:23,930 --> 01:59:24,450
Alright!

3187
01:59:24,550 --> 01:59:25,170
Level 1000!

3188
01:59:25,430 --> 01:59:27,170
It's your turn to show us your crib!

3189
01:59:27,990 --> 01:59:28,930
It's your turn!

3190
01:59:30,050 --> 01:59:32,030
To show us your crib sir!

3191
01:59:32,990 --> 01:59:33,870
We're ready!

3192
01:59:33,870 --> 01:59:34,510
Hahaha!

3193
01:59:34,890 --> 01:59:37,270
This is a house tour!

3194
01:59:37,470 --> 01:59:38,030
Hahaha!

3195
01:59:38,930 --> 01:59:41,330
This is like MTV right now!

3196
01:59:41,490 --> 01:59:42,090
In Fallout!

3197
01:59:43,580 --> 01:59:45,410
MTV Fallout right now!

3198
01:59:45,690 --> 01:59:46,370
Hahaha!

3199
01:59:47,710 --> 01:59:49,110
We're pioneering!

3200
01:59:49,910 --> 01:59:52,690
MTV doesn't exist in 22...

3201
01:59:53,720 --> 01:59:54,070
2070!

3202
01:59:54,410 --> 01:59:55,310
What the fuck!

3203
01:59:55,510 --> 01:59:56,190
I need some ammo!

3204
01:59:56,550 --> 01:59:57,010
Hey you!

3205
01:59:57,090 --> 01:59:57,930
Can you give me ammo?

3206
01:59:58,310 --> 01:59:58,870
Hahaha!

3207
02:00:00,050 --> 02:00:01,790
Give me a salt rifle mate!

3208
02:00:03,870 --> 02:00:04,030
Hahaha!

3209
02:00:04,210 --> 02:00:07,990
I feel like that guy is an actual real player!

3210
02:00:08,730 --> 02:00:09,210
Hahaha!

3211
02:00:11,410 --> 02:00:11,890
MTV!

3212
02:00:12,510 --> 02:00:14,990
We're bringing back MTV Cribs!

3213
02:00:15,230 --> 02:00:19,030
Because MTV doesn't exist in 2276!

3214
02:00:19,550 --> 02:00:21,890
We can claim it as an original idea!

3215
02:00:22,970 --> 02:00:23,690
I think...

3216
02:00:23,690 --> 02:00:26,270
I feel like that bad guy is a real player!

3217
02:00:26,490 --> 02:00:27,730
I don't think he's a dragoon!

3218
02:00:27,950 --> 02:00:29,630
I think he's an actual...

3219
02:00:29,630 --> 02:00:30,430
Wait no he is!

3220
02:00:30,490 --> 02:00:31,090
He's following us!

3221
02:00:31,130 --> 02:00:31,550
Nevermind!

3222
02:00:31,590 --> 02:00:33,050
He's a real player that actually needed ammo!

3223
02:00:33,870 --> 02:00:34,130
Hahaha!

3224
02:00:35,970 --> 02:00:37,690
Lost... Lost vampire!

3225
02:00:38,330 --> 02:00:40,350
He's just here for ammo!

3226
02:00:40,970 --> 02:00:41,650
Hello!

3227
02:00:41,710 --> 02:00:41,830
Hello!

3228
02:00:41,910 --> 02:00:44,290
I have the salt rifle ammo mate!

3229
02:00:44,730 --> 02:00:45,410
Hahaha!

3230
02:00:45,410 --> 02:00:46,370
He's just here!

3231
02:00:46,450 --> 02:00:48,410
See if I got some salt rifle ammo!

3232
02:00:48,530 --> 02:00:49,210
Hahaha!

3233
02:00:50,470 --> 02:00:50,630
Hahaha!

3234
02:00:54,130 --> 02:00:55,790
The guy is...

3235
02:00:55,790 --> 02:00:58,310
He just wants some ammo bro!

3236
02:00:58,530 --> 02:01:00,410
He just wants the ammo!

3237
02:01:00,810 --> 02:01:01,870
He just...

3238
02:01:01,870 --> 02:01:03,850
He's just here for ammo!

3239
02:01:04,110 --> 02:01:05,550
He doesn't know what's going on!

3240
02:01:05,670 --> 02:01:06,830
He's following everybody!

3241
02:01:07,330 --> 02:01:09,230
He probably just saw the crowd!

3242
02:01:09,790 --> 02:01:12,510
Give this man some salt ammo!

3243
02:01:12,990 --> 02:01:13,570
Hahaha!

3244
02:01:14,370 --> 02:01:16,990
No it's a real player talking!

3245
02:01:20,250 --> 02:01:21,050
Hahaha!

3246
02:01:21,710 --> 02:01:21,750
Hahaha!

3247
02:01:21,750 --> 02:01:23,170
Alright let's see...

3248
02:01:23,170 --> 02:01:24,810
I hope this... Okay...

3249
02:01:24,810 --> 02:01:31,610
I expect Mr. Long lost vampire to have an insane crib!

3250
02:01:31,970 --> 02:01:32,930
I mean...

3251
02:01:32,930 --> 02:01:35,110
All I'm saying is that LostBod...

3252
02:01:36,470 --> 02:01:37,130
LostBod...

3253
02:01:37,130 --> 02:01:38,870
Fucking showed us a...

3254
02:01:38,870 --> 02:01:40,070
A fucking crib!

3255
02:01:40,430 --> 02:01:43,010
Like a house and his man cave!

3256
02:01:43,510 --> 02:01:44,370
So like...

3257
02:01:44,370 --> 02:01:49,870
It's gonna be a little embarrassing if Mr. Level 1412 cannot live up to it!

3258
02:01:50,350 --> 02:01:50,910
Hahaha!

3259
02:01:52,830 --> 02:01:53,490
Hahaha!

3260
02:01:56,030 --> 02:01:56,690
Alright...

3261
02:01:56,690 --> 02:01:59,030
How far away is your house?

3262
02:01:59,290 --> 02:02:00,530
Holy shit!

3263
02:02:00,750 --> 02:02:03,290
Did you build your house in the middle of nowhere?

3264
02:02:04,090 --> 02:02:04,690
Like...

3265
02:02:04,690 --> 02:02:06,010
Are you a hermit sir?

3266
02:02:06,510 --> 02:02:08,530
Like no pressure by the way!

3267
02:02:08,670 --> 02:02:09,830
No fucking pressure!

3268
02:02:10,370 --> 02:02:10,750
Hahaha!

3269
02:02:12,470 --> 02:02:12,770
Hahaha!

3270
02:02:13,350 --> 02:02:16,710
He does have a tall bar to be at the moment!

3271
02:02:17,070 --> 02:02:17,670
Please!

3272
02:02:17,730 --> 02:02:18,150
Hahaha!

3273
02:02:19,070 --> 02:02:20,390
I like how everyone's like...

3274
02:02:20,390 --> 02:02:21,770
It's gonna be disappointing Doki!

3275
02:02:21,770 --> 02:02:24,110
Gotta temper your expectations right now!

3276
02:02:24,330 --> 02:02:24,730
Yeah!

3277
02:02:26,630 --> 02:02:27,310
Alright...

3278
02:02:27,310 --> 02:02:28,930
Just you wait guys!

3279
02:02:29,370 --> 02:02:31,810
I like how Wally is like not even...

3280
02:02:31,810 --> 02:02:32,730
With us anymore!

3281
02:02:33,210 --> 02:02:34,930
He's all the way up there!

3282
02:02:36,670 --> 02:02:37,930
Oh my god!

3283
02:02:38,410 --> 02:02:39,530
Look at my...

3284
02:02:39,530 --> 02:02:40,930
Dokimons guys!

3285
02:02:41,530 --> 02:02:43,450
It truly is...

3286
02:02:43,450 --> 02:02:43,950
Hahaha!

3287
02:02:44,790 --> 02:02:45,970
Streamer privileges!

3288
02:02:46,730 --> 02:02:47,250
Hahaha!

3289
02:02:47,570 --> 02:02:49,230
I'm gonna make it look so fun!

3290
02:02:49,530 --> 02:02:51,150
With me playing this game!

3291
02:02:51,770 --> 02:02:53,510
And then you guys are gonna download the game!

3292
02:02:53,630 --> 02:02:58,130
And you're gonna like get like fucking beat up by the first level 30 or something!

3293
02:02:58,510 --> 02:02:58,970
Hahaha!

3294
02:03:00,110 --> 02:03:02,050
It would be like a new Vault Dweller!

3295
02:03:02,310 --> 02:03:04,030
And then you're gonna have PvP on!

3296
02:03:04,150 --> 02:03:06,650
And some fucking level 30 is just gonna beat you up!

3297
02:03:06,970 --> 02:03:07,450
Hahaha!

3298
02:03:09,730 --> 02:03:10,210
Hahaha!

3299
02:03:10,210 --> 02:03:10,430
Hahaha!

3300
02:03:13,370 --> 02:03:15,790
It's true they do move in herds!

3301
02:03:17,270 --> 02:03:19,770
I have a full escort!

3302
02:03:20,070 --> 02:03:21,310
Look at my escort!

3303
02:03:21,770 --> 02:03:22,210
Guys!

3304
02:03:23,530 --> 02:03:27,070
First time seeing so many people outside of the defense!

3305
02:03:28,150 --> 02:03:29,850
Sounds about right!

3306
02:03:32,050 --> 02:03:33,430
Alright here we go!

3307
02:03:33,930 --> 02:03:36,710
Instead of being bullied by the higher level...

3308
02:03:36,710 --> 02:03:39,150
They're being bullied by the level 3!

3309
02:03:39,430 --> 02:03:40,810
This is the life!

3310
02:03:41,030 --> 02:03:41,850
Who are we following?

3311
02:03:42,430 --> 02:03:43,070
Hahaha!

3312
02:03:46,610 --> 02:03:47,330
Hahaha!

3313
02:03:47,330 --> 02:03:47,750
Hahaha!

3314
02:03:47,750 --> 02:03:49,130
We are following a woman!

3315
02:03:49,790 --> 02:03:51,330
What the fuck!

3316
02:03:52,410 --> 02:03:53,130
Hahaha!

3317
02:03:53,570 --> 02:03:54,290
Hahaha!

3318
02:03:55,130 --> 02:03:55,210
Hahaha!

3319
02:03:56,470 --> 02:03:58,670
I feel like they're easy!

3320
02:03:59,570 --> 02:04:00,410
Give me ammo!

3321
02:04:00,690 --> 02:04:02,630
Give me assault rifle ammo!

3322
02:04:02,910 --> 02:04:03,630
Hahahah!

3323
02:04:04,830 --> 02:04:06,010
Give me ammo!

3324
02:04:06,670 --> 02:04:09,770
Give me ammunition!

3325
02:04:10,350 --> 02:04:10,930
Give me ammunition!

3326
02:04:11,650 --> 02:04:12,570
What the fuck!

3327
02:04:12,570 --> 02:04:13,170
Ammunition!

3328
02:04:13,630 --> 02:04:19,550
We are so confused right now!

3329
02:04:20,130 --> 02:04:21,750
We are so confused right now!

3330
02:04:24,070 --> 02:04:26,810
You still just wants ammo bro.

3331
02:04:27,070 --> 02:04:29,770
Holy shit is this your home?

3332
02:04:30,510 --> 02:04:32,630
You have a fucking mansion?

3333
02:04:33,490 --> 02:04:35,990
What is this a gated community?

3334
02:04:36,830 --> 02:04:38,170
There's no way.

3335
02:04:38,350 --> 02:04:41,050
You can't have this entire thing as your home.

3336
02:04:41,310 --> 02:04:42,530
There's no fucking way.

3337
02:04:42,730 --> 02:04:46,630
You built your mansion?

3338
02:04:48,690 --> 02:04:51,550
You built your house out of golf course?

3339
02:04:53,690 --> 02:04:55,890
Is he Bruce Wayne?

3340
02:04:57,370 --> 02:04:59,170
Oh it's not is it?

3341
02:04:59,570 --> 02:05:00,770
Where did he go?

3342
02:05:02,930 --> 02:05:04,490
Where is his house?

3343
02:05:04,910 --> 02:05:06,790
Where is your house sir?

3344
02:05:06,890 --> 02:05:07,690
Oh my god.

3345
02:05:08,090 --> 02:05:12,650
There's too many of us MTV Cribs for real.

3346
02:05:13,370 --> 02:05:14,370
Oh no.

3347
02:05:14,510 --> 02:05:15,210
Oh no.

3348
02:05:15,250 --> 02:05:16,210
Why am I getting hit?

3349
02:05:16,310 --> 02:05:16,610
Oh no.

3350
02:05:16,610 --> 02:05:16,610
Why am I getting hit?

3351
02:05:16,630 --> 02:05:18,150
What is this?

3352
02:05:26,410 --> 02:05:28,330
Where is your home sir?

3353
02:05:28,430 --> 02:05:29,190
How far?

3354
02:05:29,430 --> 02:05:31,390
What the fuck is that?

3355
02:05:32,810 --> 02:05:35,430
A glowing rat stag.

3356
02:05:35,710 --> 02:05:36,550
Is this your home?

3357
02:05:36,830 --> 02:05:38,150
Oh my god.

3358
02:05:38,210 --> 02:05:39,850
You have a tennis court?

3359
02:05:40,890 --> 02:05:42,810
Bro what the fuck?

3360
02:05:43,170 --> 02:05:45,550
Is this actually your home sir?

3361
02:05:45,550 --> 02:05:47,810
No we have to keep going.

3362
02:05:47,950 --> 02:05:48,510
Okay.

3363
02:05:49,050 --> 02:05:50,630
We have to keep going.

3364
02:05:50,650 --> 02:05:51,330
God damn it.

3365
02:05:51,450 --> 02:05:52,690
Where is it?

3366
02:05:56,010 --> 02:05:57,430
It's over there.

3367
02:05:57,590 --> 02:05:59,830
We traveled so far.

3368
02:06:00,590 --> 02:06:02,450
We traveled so far.

3369
02:06:03,510 --> 02:06:05,150
What the fuck?

3370
02:06:06,610 --> 02:06:08,170
Holy shit.

3371
02:06:09,010 --> 02:06:10,430
Where is your home?

3372
02:06:11,290 --> 02:06:12,430
Is this it?

3373
02:06:13,030 --> 02:06:14,250

3374
02:06:15,050 --> 02:06:16,030
Is this it?

3375
02:06:16,230 --> 02:06:17,710
I swear to god.

3376
02:06:17,890 --> 02:06:19,550
Is this actually it?

3377
02:06:21,990 --> 02:06:23,930
Oh thank god it wasn't.

3378
02:06:24,190 --> 02:06:24,790
Okay.

3379
02:06:25,070 --> 02:06:29,550
Dude that's gonna be like no way that...

3380
02:06:31,310 --> 02:06:37,270
Oh my god.

3381
02:06:38,050 --> 02:06:40,850
I was gonna be like holy fuck.

3382
02:06:40,930 --> 02:06:45,070
We traveled all the way just to see a bunch of generators.

3383
02:06:47,590 --> 02:06:48,670
Oh my god.

3384
02:06:48,730 --> 02:06:49,530
Guys I don't think we can make it.

3385
02:06:49,530 --> 02:06:50,630
I don't think we're in Kansas anymore.

3386
02:06:50,890 --> 02:06:52,190
We traveled so far.

3387
02:06:53,050 --> 02:06:55,030
We traveled so far.

3388
02:06:55,190 --> 02:06:56,130
It's home consistent.

3389
02:06:57,150 --> 02:06:58,230
Three generators.

3390
02:06:59,130 --> 02:06:59,570
Alright.

3391
02:06:59,670 --> 02:07:00,390
Is this your home?

3392
02:07:01,150 --> 02:07:02,010
Is this it?

3393
02:07:09,210 --> 02:07:10,530
Okay not gonna lie.

3394
02:07:10,990 --> 02:07:11,530
Bro.

3395
02:07:18,530 --> 02:07:20,290
Okay not gonna lie bro.

3396
02:07:20,550 --> 02:07:23,890
I think you need a higher interior decorator.

3397
02:07:25,750 --> 02:07:26,390
Okay.

3398
02:07:26,610 --> 02:07:27,250
That...

3399
02:07:27,250 --> 02:07:29,670
Not gonna lie bro.

3400
02:07:32,050 --> 02:07:35,770
Okay this isn't what I expected when I first saw a house.

3401
02:07:40,950 --> 02:07:42,170
Wait what?

3402
02:07:42,650 --> 02:07:43,650
That got locked.

3403
02:07:43,750 --> 02:07:44,630
Okay I was gonna say that.

3404
02:07:44,710 --> 02:07:45,610
I locked it.

3405
02:07:45,810 --> 02:07:46,450
Look.

3406
02:07:46,970 --> 02:07:49,630
This is definitely a home.

3407
02:07:52,070 --> 02:07:54,350
Best family road trip.

3408
02:07:54,350 --> 02:07:56,510
Thank you for the super chat pushing.

3409
02:07:56,830 --> 02:07:57,310
Thank you.

3410
02:07:57,330 --> 02:07:57,910
Thank you.

3411
02:07:57,970 --> 02:07:59,570
It looks like a real home though.

3412
02:07:59,650 --> 02:08:00,350
I'll give you that.

3413
02:08:00,690 --> 02:08:04,350
I think you got hit up last to help you decorate your home.

3414
02:08:04,570 --> 02:08:05,410
Oh my god.

3415
02:08:05,470 --> 02:08:05,670
What?

3416
02:08:08,890 --> 02:08:09,590
Let's see.

3417
02:08:09,970 --> 02:08:11,990
I'll just say...

3418
02:08:14,190 --> 02:08:15,710
I'll just say...

3419
02:08:15,710 --> 02:08:16,650
I'll just say...

3420
02:08:16,650 --> 02:08:17,190
Question mark.

3421
02:08:17,190 --> 02:08:17,570
.

3422
02:08:23,910 --> 02:08:24,390
.

3423
02:08:24,390 --> 02:08:24,850
.

3424
02:08:28,530 --> 02:08:29,510
Where's your shelter?

3425
02:08:31,210 --> 02:08:32,590
Maybe that's your front.

3426
02:08:32,650 --> 02:08:33,270
Where's the shelter?

3427
02:08:33,630 --> 02:08:34,530
Do you have a vault?

3428
02:08:35,310 --> 02:08:36,610
Do you have a vault sir?

3429
02:08:37,410 --> 02:08:38,230
Where is it?

3430
02:08:38,950 --> 02:08:39,770
Where's your vault?

3431
02:08:41,810 --> 02:08:43,230
Do you not even have a vault?

3432
02:08:43,550 --> 02:08:45,010
Oh man I just need some ammo.

3433
02:08:45,330 --> 02:08:46,690
Do you not even have a...

3434
02:08:47,190 --> 02:08:48,930
Do you not have a vault?

3435
02:08:49,550 --> 02:08:51,490
He doesn't even have a vault!

3436
02:08:52,410 --> 02:08:54,230
Oh my god.

3437
02:08:54,610 --> 02:08:55,250

3439
02:08:57,830 --> 02:08:58,550
We're gonna...

3440
02:08:59,510 --> 02:09:02,970
Bro this guy keeps asking about his vault.

3441
02:09:03,270 --> 02:09:03,350
Bro this guy keeps asking about his vault.

3442
02:09:03,350 --> 02:09:04,730
How do I leave the team?

3443
02:09:06,950 --> 02:09:08,890
Wait how do I mute people?

3444
02:09:09,090 --> 02:09:10,750
Guys how do I...

3445
02:09:10,750 --> 02:09:12,290
How do I mute people?

3446
02:09:13,330 --> 02:09:15,350
Bro this guy is still...

3447
02:09:15,350 --> 02:09:16,510

3448
02:09:17,730 --> 02:09:19,130
Guys, I don't...

3449
02:09:19,130 --> 02:09:19,750
Oh there it is!

3450
02:09:20,090 --> 02:09:20,770
There's the vault!

3451
02:09:20,910 --> 02:09:23,170
I was gonna be like, I can't believe this man...

3452
02:09:23,170 --> 02:09:24,210
...doesn't even have a vault.

3453
02:09:27,150 --> 02:09:28,190
Escape social.

3454
02:09:28,630 --> 02:09:29,110
Oh okay.

3455
02:09:30,470 --> 02:09:30,990
Escape...

3456
02:09:33,330 --> 02:09:33,850
Escape...

3457
02:09:34,590 --> 02:09:35,110
Social.

3458
02:09:36,830 --> 02:09:37,870
Jesus Christ.

3459
02:09:38,790 --> 02:09:39,910
Where's my team?

3460
02:09:40,410 --> 02:09:41,590
Alright there you go.

3461
02:09:41,690 --> 02:09:42,570
How do I...

3462
02:09:42,570 --> 02:09:43,490
Oh mute.

3463
02:09:44,670 --> 02:09:45,750
Okay there you go.

3464
02:09:46,250 --> 02:09:46,770
Mute.

3465
02:09:47,190 --> 02:09:47,770
We did it.

3466
02:09:48,110 --> 02:09:49,450
We fucking did it.

3467
02:09:49,850 --> 02:09:50,370
Alright.

3468
02:09:51,090 --> 02:09:52,330
Oh, he got kicked out.

3469
02:09:56,710 --> 02:09:58,110
What is this?

3470
02:10:01,150 --> 02:10:04,770
I feel like we should have saw the level 1000 house first.

3471
02:10:05,250 --> 02:10:06,330
Alright, let's see.

3472
02:10:07,290 --> 02:10:08,970
Oh, he has like a little cafeteria.

3473
02:10:10,590 --> 02:10:12,070
Like for one person.

3474
02:10:15,070 --> 02:10:16,450
Goodbye ammo guy.

3475
02:10:16,450 --> 02:10:19,750
He has like a cafeteria for one person.

3476
02:10:20,050 --> 02:10:20,370
Alright.

3477
02:10:20,570 --> 02:10:21,630
Not gonna lie.

3478
02:10:22,150 --> 02:10:25,410
I think LostBod won this.

3479
02:10:25,610 --> 02:10:26,570
I'm sorry man.

3480
02:10:26,850 --> 02:10:30,150
You might be like super high level but like...

3481
02:10:30,990 --> 02:10:32,630
LostBod had the better crib.

3482
02:10:32,790 --> 02:10:33,450
Not gonna lie.

3483
02:10:40,410 --> 02:10:41,690
Don't house shade?

3484
02:10:41,850 --> 02:10:42,210
Look.

3485
02:10:42,390 --> 02:10:43,870
There was expectations.

3486
02:10:47,850 --> 02:10:50,430
There was high expectations.

3487
02:10:50,510 --> 02:10:52,690
From LostBod.

3488
02:10:52,890 --> 02:10:56,590
That man nearly built a fucking mansion for himself.

3489
02:10:57,210 --> 02:10:59,290
With a fucking man cave.

3490
02:10:59,490 --> 02:11:00,710
He is optimized.

3491
02:11:07,210 --> 02:11:09,030
It's not about the size.

3492
02:11:09,370 --> 02:11:12,410
He was busy grinding 600 more levels.

3493
02:11:16,290 --> 02:11:19,150
He set the bar way too high.

3494
02:11:19,150 --> 02:11:20,330
Alright guys.

3495
02:11:20,510 --> 02:11:22,290
Let's actually do the mission.

3496
02:11:22,710 --> 02:11:24,110
Okay, where am I?

3497
02:11:24,290 --> 02:11:26,550
I'm so far from home.

3498
02:11:26,750 --> 02:11:28,870
Where was my main mission?

3499
02:11:29,930 --> 02:11:31,730
I ran so far.

3500
02:11:31,990 --> 02:11:34,410
Is there fast travel in this game?

3501
02:11:34,930 --> 02:11:35,610
Oh, please.

3502
02:11:35,830 --> 02:11:36,890
Oh, there is.

3503
02:11:37,130 --> 02:11:38,130
Oh my god.

3504
02:11:38,190 --> 02:11:38,850
There is.

3505
02:11:39,130 --> 02:11:41,450
LostBod's house is my fast travel.

3506
02:11:41,450 --> 02:11:42,270
I have a hammer!

3507
02:11:46,110 --> 02:11:48,370
What the fuck?

3508
02:11:49,370 --> 02:11:51,050
What the fuck.

3509
02:11:51,110 --> 02:11:51,850
I'm level four.

3510
02:11:51,970 --> 02:11:52,190
How?

3511
02:11:53,370 --> 02:11:55,530
Who the fuck just screamed?

3512
02:11:56,130 --> 02:11:57,390
I have a...

3513
02:11:58,120 --> 02:11:58,990
Where am I?

3514
02:11:59,150 --> 02:12:00,230
Who screams?

3515
02:12:02,730 --> 02:12:04,530
Holy shit.

3516
02:12:06,040 --> 02:12:07,690
What the fuck.

3517
02:12:08,070 --> 02:12:10,150
Somebody got injured.

3518
02:12:10,150 --> 02:12:10,490
Dude!

3519
02:12:11,130 --> 02:12:11,690
Alright.

3520
02:12:15,490 --> 02:12:17,730
Alright, we actually have fast travel.

3521
02:12:17,770 --> 02:12:18,830
Thank fucking god.

3522
02:12:19,210 --> 02:12:22,430
Okay guys, I need to figure out like...

3523
02:12:23,230 --> 02:12:24,030
Don't worry.

3524
02:12:24,450 --> 02:12:27,090
Oh my god, I'm so fucking strong!

3525
02:12:27,990 --> 02:12:30,330
Okay, I need to figure out...

3526
02:12:31,570 --> 02:12:33,610
like... where my mission was.

3527
02:12:34,510 --> 02:12:35,570
Where was it?

3528
02:12:36,270 --> 02:12:39,170
Hey guys, I need to figure out like where to go.

3529
02:12:44,990 --> 02:12:46,530
God, my aim is so good.

3530
02:12:48,470 --> 02:12:49,790
Holy shit, look at that.

3531
02:12:50,670 --> 02:12:51,310
Oh me!

3532
02:12:52,530 --> 02:12:53,590
Third person!

3533
02:12:55,650 --> 02:12:57,190
You left the dokimons?

3534
02:12:57,370 --> 02:12:59,890
The dokimons will eventually find me guys.

3535
02:13:00,270 --> 02:13:01,790
Alright, let me... let's see.

3536
02:13:01,870 --> 02:13:02,830
Where's my first mission?

02:13:03,550 --> 02:13:05,370
Go to White Hunter.

3538
02:13:05,650 --> 02:13:07,010
Build a weapons workbench.

3539
02:13:07,090 --> 02:13:08,990
Oh yeah, we're gonna build our workbench at...

3540
02:13:10,150 --> 02:13:10,970
Bod's place.

3541
02:13:11,390 --> 02:13:12,770
That's our new home now.

3542
02:13:13,230 --> 02:13:14,490
Where's Bod's house?

3543
02:13:14,770 --> 02:13:15,650
Where was it?

3544
02:13:15,690 --> 02:13:16,930
I fast traveled to his house.

3545
02:13:17,310 --> 02:13:17,950
There you go.

3546
02:13:18,050 --> 02:13:18,350
Alright.

3547
02:13:18,750 --> 02:13:23,530
I need to build a workers workbench at your camp to scrap items.

3548
02:13:23,890 --> 02:13:26,470

This... we're their neighbors right here.

3553
02:13:36,550 --> 02:13:37,850
How do I build it?

3554
02:13:38,410 --> 02:13:38,730

3557
02:13:41,810 --> 02:13:42,330
Alright.

3558
02:13:42,430 --> 02:13:44,310

02:13:51,470 --> 02:13:52,510
We're squatting.

3560
02:13:55,470 --> 02:13:55,990
Okay.

3561
02:13:56,150 --> 02:13:57,830
How do I build it chat?

3562
02:13:58,990 --> 02:13:59,770
Stealing house?

3563
02:13:59,850 --> 02:14:00,570
It's not stealing!

3564
02:14:03,310 --> 02:14:04,770
It's not stealing guys!

3565
02:14:06,250 --> 02:14:07,950
Is it a place for your camp?

3566
02:14:08,250 --> 02:14:09,190
I can't place it.

3567
02:14:10,130 --> 02:14:11,250
How do I place it?

3568
02:14:12,290 --> 02:14:14,370

02:14:38,130 --> 02:14:39,450
How do I become his neighbor?

3586
02:14:41,810 --> 02:14:44,470
You need to set a... camp station.

3587
02:14:45,630 --> 02:14:47,590
How do I... wait what?

3588
02:14:48,210 --> 02:14:49,730
Oh it's too close.

3589
02:14:49,990 --> 02:14:51,250
Don't worry Bod!

3591
02:14:54,670 --> 02:14:57,590
I just need to... be further away.

3592
02:14:58,310 --> 02:14:59,330
Don't worry!

3593
02:14:59,990 --> 02:15:01,190
I'm almost there!

3594
02:15:01,870 --> 02:15:02,290
Hahahaha.

3595
02:15:04,450 --> 02:15:05,290

3596
02:15:05,750 --> 02:15:08,970
Why is your radius so far?!

3597
02:15:08,970 --> 02:15:11,670
How am I gonna be your neighbor?

3598
02:15:15,870 --> 02:15:18,870

Why is your house fucking huge?

02:15:43,130 --> 02:15:45,210
Who also built around here?

3607
02:15:45,330 --> 02:15:48,030
Is it because everybody else is also around you?

3608
02:15:50,370 --> 02:15:54,890
Am I gonna come over and ask for like sugar when I'm so far?

3609
02:15:57,970 --> 02:15:58,630
Bro!

3610
02:15:58,810 --> 02:16:00,210

That's not fair!

3616
02:16:14,290 --> 02:16:16,810
Everybody else is like your neighbor!

3617
02:16:17,390 --> 02:16:17,970
Oh, here!

3618
02:16:18,110 --> 02:16:18,450

3639
02:16:52,610 --> 02:16:55,970
Look, I don't even care about what my home looks like.

3640
02:16:56,090 --> 02:16:57,950
I can mooch off Bob's house.

3641
02:17:01,990 --> 02:17:04,030
That's all that matters!

3642
02:17:04,210 --> 02:17:05,590

I have a platform.

3648
02:17:15,090 --> 02:17:16,150

3649
02:17:16,850 --> 02:17:18,150
I guess I'll just build this.

3650
02:17:18,330 --> 02:17:20,730
This is my platform where I give my speeches, guys.

3651

3656
02:17:33,790 --> 02:17:36,350
Okay, and then it's gonna have a wall in the back.

3657
02:17:37,930 --> 02:17:39,350
How do I put it in the back?

3658
02:17:39,730 --> 02:17:40,350

But as a leader.

3668
02:17:54,050 --> 02:17:54,610
Oh my god!

02:17:57,750 --> 02:17:59,310
And then there's gonna be food here.

3672
02:18:00,150 --> 02:18:01,030
And then...

3673
02:18:01,030 --> 02:18:01,790
Oh my god!

3674
02:18:01,810 --> 02:18:03,390
I can have a gated community?

3675
02:18:04,910 --> 02:18:05,910
Wait, what?

3676
02:18:06,190 --> 02:18:07,190
What is this?

3677
02:18:07,270 --> 02:18:08,770
A small generator.

3678
02:18:09,750 --> 02:18:10,190
Oh!

3679
02:18:11,650 --> 02:18:13,570
Wait, I can have a gated community!

3680
02:18:15,030 --> 02:18:15,470
Okay.

Okay, no one...

02:18:21,090 --> 02:18:24,690
So no... Okay, actually... Nah, I'm too lazy to add a gated community.

3684
02:18:25,130 --> 02:18:25,890

3685
02:18:26,550 --> 02:18:27,730
This is my home!

3686
02:18:28,130 --> 02:18:29,430
This is my crib.

3687
02:18:29,870 --> 02:18:30,790
Alright, let's see.

What does that look like?

3722
02:19:36,770 --> 02:19:37,770
Does it look bad?

3723
02:19:38,090 --> 02:19:39,130
Okay, no it doesn't.

3724
02:19:39,130 --> 02:19:39,330
Okay.

3725
02:19:39,750 --> 02:19:40,190
Nice.

3726
02:19:40,310 --> 02:19:41,570
Actually, no, I don't like...

3727
02:19:41,570 --> 02:19:42,730
No, it's so dirty.

3728
02:19:45,210 --> 02:19:46,490
Alright, what about the hat?

3729
02:19:47,690 --> 02:19:48,710
Okay, let's see.

3730
02:19:50,170 --> 02:19:51,170
What do I look like?

3731
02:19:51,330 --> 02:19:51,730
Oh!

3732
02:19:52,010 --> 02:19:53,530
I look sick as hell!

3733
02:19:53,530 --> 02:19:54,750
And my hair is out.

3734
02:19:54,930 --> 02:19:55,510
Hello.

3735
02:19:56,050 --> 02:19:57,830
Hello ladies and boys.

3736
02:20:00,070 --> 02:20:03,810
So, she's judging people's homes while being homeless.

3737
02:20:04,070 --> 02:20:08,330
Look, look, I might be homeless, but like, I have a cook.

3738
02:20:08,530 --> 02:20:09,950
I have a chef.

3739
02:20:10,170 --> 02:20:10,730
Okay?

3740
02:20:11,070 --> 02:20:12,450
I don't need a home.

3741
02:20:12,610 --> 02:20:14,650
I can moosh off other people's homes.

3742
02:20:14,910 --> 02:20:20,470
Why waste money on electricity bills when I can have these people to pay for it?

3743
02:20:22,530 --> 02:20:23,510
Where I can...

3744
02:20:23,510 --> 02:20:25,390
I can just live at their home, guys.

3745
02:20:25,790 --> 02:20:27,050
It's just that easy.

02:20:27,590 --> 02:20:28,870
Oh hey, the fixer.

3747
02:20:28,930 --> 02:20:29,910

3748
02:20:30,550 --> 02:20:31,330
What is this?

3749
02:20:33,330 --> 02:20:35,950
Insult bot sponsored by Robco.

3750
02:20:37,390 --> 02:20:39,130
Insult bot is a social experiment.

3751
02:20:40,690 --> 02:20:42,710
The insult bot is in three...

3752
02:20:42,710 --> 02:20:43,170

Guys, why do I need to... I'm a squa...

3755
02:20:47,970 --> 02:20:50,090
I won't say I'm a squatter!

02:20:50,530 --> 02:20:52,250

3757
02:20:52,250 --> 02:20:53,730
I am a roommate.

3758
02:20:54,050 --> 02:20:54,470
Okay?

3759
02:20:54,530 --> 02:20:56,550

3760
02:21:00,790 --> 02:21:02,650
I'm not a squatter!

3761
02:21:03,150 --> 02:21:04,530
I'm your roommate!

3762
02:21:04,910 --> 02:21:06,170
That's different!

3763
02:21:07,050 --> 02:21:08,550
That's so different!

3764
02:21:09,150 --> 02:21:10,870
Where is my quest?

3765
02:21:11,270 --> 02:21:11,630
Okay.

3766
02:21:12,490 --> 02:21:13,210

What do I need to... Where is the... Where's my quest?

3770
02:21:18,650 --> 02:21:20,450
Uh... Hunter for hire.

3771
02:21:20,770 --> 02:21:22,230
Oh, building weapons for the...

3772
02:21:22,250 --> 02:21:22,670
Workbench.

3773
02:21:23,350 --> 02:21:23,870
Okay.

3774
02:21:23,930 --> 02:21:26,650
Load, broadcast, and activate the connection.

3775
02:21:26,950 --> 02:21:28,710
Wait, do I not have a worker's workbench?

3776
02:21:29,310 --> 02:21:30,430
What does that look like?

3777
02:21:32,970 --> 02:21:35,290
Wait, what's a worker's workbench?

3778
02:21:35,850 --> 02:21:36,370

3779
02:21:36,890 --> 02:21:37,410
No.

3780
02:21:39,230 --> 02:21:39,970
Oh wait.

02:21:40,070 --> 02:21:41,310
I unlocked it for free.

3782
02:21:41,370 --> 02:21:42,130
What did I unlock?

3783
02:21:42,510 --> 02:21:43,030
Oh!

3784
02:21:43,070 --> 02:21:44,390
I unlocked my vault!

3785
02:21:44,810 --> 02:21:45,330

3786
02:21:45,930 --> 02:21:46,450
Look!

3787
02:21:49,410 --> 02:21:49,930

Oh, I can't even put it down.

3795
02:22:03,470 --> 02:22:04,230
Okay, guys.

3796
02:22:04,370 --> 02:22:05,690
Where the fuck is my...

3797
02:22:07,110 --> 02:22:10,170
Where the fuck is my worker's workbench?

3798
02:22:12,370 --> 02:22:13,190
Oh my god.

3799
02:22:13,250 --> 02:22:15,710
Guys, I need the worker's workbench to unlock...

3800
02:22:15,710 --> 02:22:16,030
Oh my god.

3801
02:22:16,050 --> 02:22:16,590
Is that my bed?

3802
02:22:17,690 --> 02:22:19,390
Guys, please don't judge my bed.

3803
02:22:19,810 --> 02:22:20,250
Guys.

3804
02:22:20,250 --> 02:22:22,330
This is not my real bed.

3805
02:22:22,510 --> 02:22:22,890
Oh wait.

3806
02:22:22,970 --> 02:22:23,850
This is a better bed.

3807
02:22:24,290 --> 02:22:24,810
Wait.

3808
02:22:25,910 --> 02:22:28,610
How do I... scroll down for this?

3809
02:22:29,770 --> 02:22:30,290
Okay.

3810
02:22:30,290 --> 02:22:30,990
Control... no.

3811
02:22:31,070 --> 02:22:33,230
How do I... tap down for...

3812
02:22:33,230 --> 02:22:33,950
Oh, there it is.

3813
02:22:34,390 --> 02:22:35,510
This is my bed.

3814
02:22:36,630 --> 02:22:37,930
This is my crib.

3815
02:22:40,050 --> 02:22:42,710
Where the fuck is the workbench?

3816
02:22:43,830 --> 02:22:45,490
Is that the workbench?

3817
02:22:45,610 --> 02:22:46,290
What is this?

3818
02:22:47,910 --> 02:22:48,430

3819
02:22:49,930 --> 02:22:50,450
Alright.

3824
02:22:52,550 --> 02:22:54,370
Where the fuck is the workbench?

3825
02:22:54,670 --> 02:22:55,490
What the fuck?

3826
02:22:56,650 --> 02:22:59,530
Guys, I need to build the workbench if I wanna...

3827
02:23:04,330 --> 02:23:06,530
Where the fuck is the...

3828
02:23:08,610 --> 02:23:13,690
Guys, I can't progress this if I don't have my workbench.

3829
02:23:14,370 --> 02:23:15,390
Oh, there you go.

3830
02:23:15,430 --> 02:23:16,310
Weapons workbench.

3831
02:23:16,470 --> 02:23:16,950

3832
02:23:17,230 --> 02:23:17,750
Right?

3833
02:23:18,730 --> 02:23:19,250
Okay.

3834
02:23:19,330 --> 02:23:20,210

3835
02:23:20,390 --> 02:23:20,630
Okay.

02:23:22,550 --> 02:23:23,350
There we go.

3837
02:23:23,450 --> 02:23:24,410
That should be it, right?

3838
02:23:25,230 --> 02:23:25,750
Yeah.

3839
02:23:26,810 --> 02:23:27,330
Completed.

3840
02:23:27,510 --> 02:23:29,550

3841
02:23:30,050 --> 02:23:31,650
Load broadcast tape?

3842
02:23:32,610 --> 02:23:34,470
What's the broadcast tape?

3843
02:23:36,710 --> 02:23:39,170
Dumb bitches live like this.

3844
02:23:40,310 --> 02:23:41,210
What do you mean?

3845
02:23:41,750 --> 02:23:43,150
Into a radio tower.

3846
02:23:43,210 --> 02:23:43,670
Okay, guys.

3847
02:23:43,710 --> 02:23:44,970
We need to find a radio tower.

3848
02:23:45,890 --> 02:23:46,410
Alright.

3849
02:23:46,510 --> 02:23:47,770
Where is the radio tower?

3850
02:23:49,630 --> 02:23:50,330
Oh, shit.

3852
02:23:52,630 --> 02:23:53,970
Guys, I'm learning!

3853
02:23:55,590 --> 02:23:57,170
I live on a hill!

3854
02:23:58,370 --> 02:23:59,650

3855
02:23:59,890 --> 02:24:00,350
Alright, guys.

3856
02:24:00,370 --> 02:24:01,310
So, here's my crib.

3857
02:24:01,550 --> 02:24:03,630
I have my vending machine right here.

3858
02:24:03,910 --> 02:24:06,830
This is my podium where people leave their offerings.

3859
02:24:06,930 --> 02:24:10,690
If you have any offerings, leave it on this table, guys.

3860
02:24:10,830 --> 02:24:11,730
This is where...

3861
02:24:12,430 --> 02:24:13,430
Where is this?

3862
02:24:13,590 --> 02:24:14,690
Pipe is like...

3863
02:24:14,690 --> 02:24:15,330

What the fuck?

3865
02:24:17,390 --> 02:24:17,910
What the fuck?

3866
02:24:20,450 --> 02:24:20,930
Okay.

02:24:21,510 --> 02:24:21,990
Alright.

3868
02:24:23,510 --> 02:24:24,810
That's a lot of stuff.

3869
02:24:25,150 --> 02:24:26,230
I'll be fine, right?

3870
02:24:26,290 --> 02:24:28,350
With all these things in my inventory.

3871
02:24:28,390 --> 02:24:28,910
Don't worry.

3872
02:24:29,150 --> 02:24:29,950
Alright, guys.

3873
02:24:30,350 --> 02:24:33,390
Guys, I need somebody to be my backpack, guys.

3874
02:24:33,450 --> 02:24:34,610
I'm gonna start throw...

3875
02:24:34,610 --> 02:24:35,690
Wait, where's my stash?

3876
02:24:35,830 --> 02:24:36,710
Do I have stashes here?

3877
02:24:37,570 --> 02:24:40,230
Did I... Did I include a stash in my crib?

3878
02:24:40,510 --> 02:24:41,470
I don't know.

3879
02:24:43,930 --> 02:24:45,930
Guys, I don't...

3880
02:24:45,930 --> 02:24:47,890
I don't know if I have a stash.

3881
02:24:47,910 --> 02:24:48,170
I don't know if I have a stash here.

3882
02:24:49,550 --> 02:24:51,370
Okay, I got a building stash, guys.

3883
02:24:51,750 --> 02:24:53,330
I knew I was missing something.

3884
02:24:54,150 --> 02:24:54,630
Okay.

3885
02:24:55,370 --> 02:24:59,390
Stairs, doors, light, water, resources.

3886
02:24:59,810 --> 02:25:00,390
Is it resources?

3887
02:25:00,750 --> 02:25:01,230
No.

3888
02:25:01,330 --> 02:25:02,550
I can't build anything here.

3889
02:25:02,730 --> 02:25:03,910
Oh, I have appliances.

3890
02:25:05,390 --> 02:25:06,590
Make a stash box?

3891
02:25:06,810 --> 02:25:07,590
Where the fuck...

3892
02:25:07,590 --> 02:25:08,190
Oh, there it is.

02:25:08,510 --> 02:25:09,790
Wait, I can't affor...

02:25:09,790 --> 02:25:10,690
Oh, I can.

3895
02:25:11,170 --> 02:25:12,890
I was gonna say I can't afford anything.

3896
02:25:13,270 --> 02:25:15,670
Guys, and this is my stash box right here.

3897
02:25:16,070 --> 02:25:17,350
Guys, it's right here.

3898
02:25:17,370 --> 02:25:17,710
Guys, it's right here.

3899
02:25:17,910 --> 02:25:18,490
Alright.

3900
02:25:20,250 --> 02:25:20,770
Nice.

3901
02:25:20,950 --> 02:25:22,210
Alright, let's transfer everything.

3902
02:25:23,990 --> 02:25:24,970
Store all...

3903
02:25:24,970 --> 02:25:25,730
Oh my god.

3904
02:25:25,770 --> 02:25:26,150
Alright, guys.

3905
02:25:26,210 --> 02:25:27,430
I'm gonna start storing things.

3906
02:25:29,910 --> 02:25:35,630
Guys, I have a feeling that I think I have too many items in my inventory.

3907
02:25:36,290 --> 02:25:37,070
Just a...

3908
02:25:37,070 --> 02:25:37,970
I don't know.

3909
02:25:38,010 --> 02:25:39,070
Just a little feeling.

3910
02:25:43,170 --> 02:25:44,390
I don't know.

3911
02:25:44,430 --> 02:25:46,030
I just feel like maybe...

3912
02:25:46,030 --> 02:25:47,890
Maybe I just have too much.

3913
02:25:47,890 --> 02:25:48,550
Too many things.

3914
02:25:48,990 --> 02:25:50,510
Oh, I have beer!

3915
02:25:51,170 --> 02:25:52,170
Okay, let's see.

3916
02:25:52,570 --> 02:25:55,330
We're gonna have to like start putting some stuff away.

3917
02:25:55,530 --> 02:25:56,850
Holy shit!

3918
02:25:57,130 --> 02:25:59,470
I have 90 of this?

3919
02:26:00,070 --> 02:26:02,750
Okay, that's a little bit too much.

3920
02:26:03,370 --> 02:26:05,110
That is a little bit...

3921
02:26:05,110 --> 02:26:06,770
Okay, I don't need any repair stuff.

3922
02:26:07,050 --> 02:26:08,190
Because I feel like...

3923
02:26:08,190 --> 02:26:10,730
I feel like you guys can just repair stuff for me.

3924
02:26:10,930 --> 02:26:11,930
How much inventory space?

3925
02:26:12,910 --> 02:26:13,470
258.

3926
02:26:13,930 --> 02:26:15,510
Okay, this is an issue.

3927
02:26:15,990 --> 02:26:17,210
This is an issue.

3928
02:26:18,670 --> 02:26:20,870
This is actually an issue.

3929
02:26:21,170 --> 02:26:23,390
I don't need stim packs.

3930
02:26:23,530 --> 02:26:24,930
You guys can just heal me later.

3931
02:26:28,410 --> 02:26:31,030
I have way too much stuff guys.

3932
02:26:31,250 --> 02:26:34,270
I have a hundred and two radaways?

3933
02:26:35,090 --> 02:26:36,370
Holy shit!

3934
02:26:37,630 --> 02:26:38,270
Bro!

3935
02:26:38,630 --> 02:26:41,210

02:26:44,090 --> 02:26:47,050

3940
02:26:59,950 --> 02:27:00,830
My ammo!

3941
02:27:02,010 --> 02:27:02,530
No!

3942
02:27:02,690 --> 02:27:03,790
What ammo was that?

3943
02:27:03,890 --> 02:27:04,370
Is it this?

3944
02:27:04,650 --> 02:27:05,370
I think it's this.

3945
02:27:05,410 --> 02:27:06,450
Yeah, it's the 10...

3946
02:27:07,010 --> 02:27:08,210
Is this okay?

3947
02:27:08,730 --> 02:27:10,630
Alright, do I still have a lot?

3948
02:27:10,750 --> 02:27:11,450
Oh my god.

3949
02:27:11,650 --> 02:27:13,250
What can I still get?

3950
02:27:13,250 --> 02:27:13,930
What can I get rid of?

3951
02:27:15,010 --> 02:27:17,270
There's so many things.

3952
02:27:20,670 --> 02:27:21,790
Is it food?

3953
02:27:21,890 --> 02:27:23,210
Guys, I think it's food.

3954
02:27:23,510 --> 02:27:24,070
Guys.

3955
02:27:25,170 --> 02:27:28,290
Guys, I think I just had a lot of food.

3956
02:27:28,650 --> 02:27:29,210
Guys!

3957
02:27:32,870 --> 02:27:35,590
I realized guys, it was the food.

3958
02:27:38,150 --> 02:27:40,950
Okay, we gotta find a radio tower.

3959
02:27:41,290 --> 02:27:42,510
Where's the radio tower?

3960
02:27:43,250 --> 02:27:44,370
Is that a radio tower?

3961
02:27:45,550 --> 02:27:48,430
Owned by wayward load... Oh, there it is.

3962
02:27:48,650 --> 02:27:50,630
Okay, we're gonna travel to this guy's house.

3963
02:27:51,070 --> 02:27:52,130
I'll pay you.

3964
02:27:52,370 --> 02:27:54,110
I have so much money anyway.

3965
02:27:55,070 --> 02:27:57,730
This random guy is just gonna have money.

3966
02:27:59,430 --> 02:28:07,830
Bro, this random guy that owns this random house is suddenly gonna get to have so many people paying him two bottle caps.

3967
02:28:08,170 --> 02:28:10,450
He's gonna... Holy shit, what the fuck?

3968
02:28:11,730 --> 02:28:12,290
Bro!

3969
02:28:12,290 --> 02:28:13,230
You're so...

3970
02:28:13,250 --> 02:28:14,070
You're so ugly!

3971
02:28:17,090 --> 02:28:23,430
I like how this random guy is just getting paid two bottle caps by like so many different people.

3972
02:28:23,890 --> 02:28:26,350
He's gonna be like, where the fuck did this come from?

3973
02:28:28,870 --> 02:28:29,390
Rude!

3974
02:28:29,410 --> 02:28:29,970
Oh, he's not?

3975
02:28:30,230 --> 02:28:31,110
What is he then?

3976
02:28:31,590 --> 02:28:33,850
That dog looks messed up.

3977
02:28:33,910 --> 02:28:35,430
That's a messed up looking dog.

3978
02:28:36,070 --> 02:28:38,630
Wait, how am I... Oh, it's cause I'm getting radiation.

3979
02:28:39,370 --> 02:28:41,370
A little bit of radiation wouldn't hurt anybody.

3980
02:28:41,670 --> 02:28:42,290
You know?

3981
02:28:43,250 --> 02:28:44,430
Just a little bit.

3982
02:28:45,170 --> 02:28:46,430
Can't be that bad.

3983
02:28:48,350 --> 02:28:51,250
You can't call bad be ugly.

3984
02:28:51,490 --> 02:28:52,310
Alright, it's this way.

3985
02:28:53,030 --> 02:28:53,650
Alright.

3986
02:28:54,960 --> 02:28:55,270
Guys.

3987
02:28:56,330 --> 02:29:02,970
I just want you guys to know my experience playing this game is definitely gonna be very different from your experience.

3988
02:29:07,010 --> 02:29:09,150
Just so you guys know.

3989
02:29:09,870 --> 02:29:12,150
This will not be the same thing.

3990
02:29:12,310 --> 02:29:12,770
You wouldn't...

3991
02:29:16,750 --> 02:29:19,110
The peak fallout experience.

3992
02:29:22,810 --> 02:29:23,490
Alright.

3993
02:29:23,690 --> 02:29:24,050
Woah!

3994
02:29:25,390 --> 02:29:27,090
Oh, there's another leader?

3995
02:29:27,830 --> 02:29:29,990
Bro, this guy's 728.

3996
02:29:30,250 --> 02:29:31,790
Why didn't I join this guy's team?

3997
02:29:34,850 --> 02:29:36,210
No way!

3998
02:29:36,370 --> 02:29:36,890
Oh shit!

3999
02:29:36,890 --> 02:29:40,690
This highway is under the protection of the responders.

4000
02:29:41,070 --> 02:29:41,370
Who's he?

4001
02:29:42,790 --> 02:29:46,830
The responders are here to keep you safe.

4002
02:29:49,890 --> 02:29:51,110
Oh, it's okay.

4003
02:29:51,230 --> 02:29:51,470
Okay.

4004
02:29:51,630 --> 02:29:52,610
He doesn't hurt me.

4005
02:29:52,910 --> 02:29:54,670
He doesn't hurt me, guys.

4006
02:29:55,210 --> 02:29:56,350
We're friends.

4007
02:29:57,230 --> 02:29:58,630
We're friends, guys.

4008
02:30:00,330 --> 02:30:01,570
VIP treatment.

4009
02:30:01,950 --> 02:30:03,130
It's my little...

4010
02:30:03,130 --> 02:30:04,450
Guys, where are the deathclaws?

4011
02:30:04,450 --> 02:30:06,850
Guys, let's fight a deathclaw!

4012
02:30:07,990 --> 02:30:10,610
After I do the radio, let's fight a deathclaw.

4013
02:30:11,590 --> 02:30:12,350
Oh, who's...

4014
02:30:12,350 --> 02:30:13,370
Wait, what is he doing here?

4015
02:30:15,530 --> 02:30:15,930
No!

4016
02:30:16,370 --> 02:30:17,470
Mr. Farmhand!

4017
02:30:18,510 --> 02:30:20,470
You destroyed somebody's farmhand!

4018
02:30:23,490 --> 02:30:25,050
This is where I draw the line.

4019
02:30:25,250 --> 02:30:26,270
Where the fuck is the radio?

4020
02:30:26,330 --> 02:30:26,810
It's this way.

4021
02:30:27,190 --> 02:30:27,590
Okay.

4022
02:30:28,410 --> 02:30:29,510
I'm always so lost.

4023
02:30:29,590 --> 02:30:32,430
The compass is like literally right below me and I'm always so lost.

4024
02:30:34,530 --> 02:30:35,610
Mr. Farmhand!

4025
02:30:36,170 --> 02:30:37,670
Mr. Farmhand!

4026
02:30:37,670 --> 02:30:37,870
Alright.

4027
02:30:37,990 --> 02:30:38,930
Let's load the broadcast.

4028
02:30:41,770 --> 02:30:42,690
Let's load it.

4029
02:30:43,150 --> 02:30:49,830
I'm too scared of turning PvP on because I feel like the dragoons are gonna turn on me the moment I have PvP on.

4030
02:30:54,170 --> 02:30:55,870
I have a feeling.

4031
02:30:57,230 --> 02:30:58,470
Let me insert this.

4032
02:31:05,770 --> 02:31:06,750
Oh, that's me!

4033
02:31:07,130 --> 02:31:07,890
I'm emergency.

4034
02:31:10,110 --> 02:31:10,510
Communication.

4035
02:31:15,910 --> 02:31:16,830
Can I load it?

4036
02:31:18,930 --> 02:31:19,330
Load.

4037
02:31:23,620 --> 02:31:24,800
Oh, I load the wrong one.

4038
02:31:25,640 --> 02:31:26,040
Sorry.

4039
02:31:28,420 --> 02:31:29,520
Wait, it checked.

4040
02:31:29,700 --> 02:31:30,380
Wrong one.

4041
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:31,720
Sorry, guys.

4042
02:31:31,940 --> 02:31:33,100
You guys weren't supposed to hear me.

4043
02:31:33,100 --> 02:31:33,780
I didn't hear that tape.

4044
02:31:33,880 --> 02:31:35,220
It was supposed to this one.

4045
02:31:37,960 --> 02:31:38,440
Activate.

4046
02:31:46,740 --> 02:31:47,220
Yeah!

4047
02:32:08,580 --> 02:32:09,060
Okay.

4048
02:32:10,800 --> 02:32:13,920
Thank you for using the Presto Radio Connection, buddy.

4049
02:32:14,160 --> 02:32:14,500
Yay!

4050
02:32:15,680 --> 02:32:16,600
I did it!

4051
02:32:16,720 --> 02:32:18,340
I got a return to my cat now.

4052
02:32:18,980 --> 02:32:19,760
Alright, guys.

4053
02:32:19,860 --> 02:32:21,180
Where's my fast travel?

4054
02:32:21,860 --> 02:32:22,740
Where's my house?

4055
02:32:22,920 --> 02:32:23,600
Okay, there you go.

4056
02:32:24,320 --> 02:32:25,120
Fast travel.

4057
02:32:25,300 --> 02:32:26,000
Oh, rename camp.

4058
02:32:28,120 --> 02:32:28,920
Real female.

4059
02:32:34,320 --> 02:32:35,680
Guys, do you think they'll believe me?

4060
02:32:42,580 --> 02:32:44,260
We gotta go back to the camp.

4061
02:32:51,560 --> 02:32:54,200
Alright, so wait to see who the sign draws in.

4062
02:32:54,460 --> 02:32:55,800
Wait, who's gonna draw it in?

4063
02:32:59,460 --> 02:33:01,980
Wait to see who the sign draws in?

4064
02:33:02,540 --> 02:33:03,700
What does that mean?

4065
02:33:05,200 --> 02:33:06,480
Oh my god, I got tinfoil.

4066
02:33:06,480 --> 02:33:07,080
Oh my god!

4067
02:33:07,120 --> 02:33:08,120
I got a tinfoil hat.

4068
02:33:08,380 --> 02:33:09,240
Untitled poem.

4069
02:33:10,840 --> 02:33:14,920
A moonwood mooning road room in...

4070
02:33:16,700 --> 02:33:17,380
What is it?

4071
02:33:17,480 --> 02:33:17,860
Oh, hey!

4072
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:18,660
Hey there!

4073
02:33:19,720 --> 02:33:20,860
You're a treasure hunter!

4074
02:33:23,820 --> 02:33:25,420
Welcome to my crib.

4075
02:33:27,100 --> 02:33:28,900
Tell you anything about the treasure you found?

4076
02:33:29,120 --> 02:33:30,140
Crane found the treasure?

4077
02:33:31,260 --> 02:33:32,300
Holy shit.

4078
02:33:33,120 --> 02:33:34,000
Where is he?

4079
02:33:36,040 --> 02:33:36,560
Uh...

4080
02:33:37,440 --> 02:33:38,120
Let's see.

4081
02:33:38,620 --> 02:33:40,200
What he tell me about Crane?

4082
02:33:41,300 --> 02:33:46,060
He came to Appalachia, not far back, hunting for the same treasure everyone else is.

4083
02:33:46,920 --> 02:33:55,860
Last time I saw him, he mentioned something about an abandoned storage facility he'd picked up some details on, but beyond the general, he didn't share.

4084
02:33:56,040 --> 02:33:57,140
Now, your turn.

4085
02:33:57,740 --> 02:33:58,580
Where is he?

4086
02:34:03,260 --> 02:34:04,740
He's right behind you.

4087
02:34:06,820 --> 02:34:08,900
Might be I pay the place a visit.

4088
02:34:10,060 --> 02:34:11,020
Appreciate the tip.

4089
02:34:11,180 --> 02:34:12,040
Not Crane.

4090
02:34:12,740 --> 02:34:13,880
Good luck out here.

4091
02:34:14,700 --> 02:34:15,400
Alright, yeah!

4092
02:34:15,660 --> 02:34:16,360
I got money!

4093
02:34:17,500 --> 02:34:18,500
I did it!

4094
02:34:20,160 --> 02:34:21,840
Is there anyone else that draws in?

4095
02:34:22,220 --> 02:34:23,200
Is it just him?

4096
02:34:26,300 --> 02:34:28,340
Alright, we got more intel about the treasure.

4097
02:34:30,020 --> 02:34:30,900
Is that it?

4098
02:34:31,480 --> 02:34:32,700
Is there anybody else?

4099
02:34:34,720 --> 02:34:36,280
Who else is gonna draw in?

4100
02:34:37,400 --> 02:34:39,120
Maximum Immersion!

4101
02:34:39,140 --> 02:34:40,900
Oh guys, I got tin foil hat!

4102
02:34:41,880 --> 02:34:42,600
Let's see.

4103
02:34:43,420 --> 02:34:44,440
What's it look like?

4104
02:34:45,120 --> 02:34:46,460
Does it look like I'm crazy?

4105
02:34:47,120 --> 02:34:48,560
No, I'm perfectly normal.

4106
02:34:48,920 --> 02:34:50,540
Everybody else is crazy.

4107
02:34:52,040 --> 02:34:52,860
Is that it?

4108
02:34:54,040 --> 02:34:54,880
Is that him?

4109
02:34:56,060 --> 02:34:57,300
You Crane?

4110
02:34:57,340 --> 02:34:58,160
Oh yes!

4111
02:34:58,220 --> 02:35:01,040
I was like who the fuck is this guy?

4112
02:35:01,560 --> 02:35:06,500
So, rumor is you got information our boss wants.

4113
02:35:06,980 --> 02:35:07,760
I do?

4114
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:12,420
You tell me where this treasure is, and he's willing to leave you alone.

4115
02:35:14,260 --> 02:35:15,180
Scouts honor.

4116
02:35:16,200 --> 02:35:18,560
Okay, I don't think you should piss me off.

4117
02:35:19,420 --> 02:35:22,220
Now I wear your scalpa as a hat.

4118
02:35:22,680 --> 02:35:23,840
Son of a bitch!

4119
02:35:25,420 --> 02:35:25,940
No!

4120
02:35:26,700 --> 02:35:27,920
Okay, I have a...

4121
02:35:27,920 --> 02:35:28,660
Okay guys.

4122
02:35:32,900 --> 02:35:33,420

4123
02:35:38,630 --> 02:35:39,150
.

4124
02:35:39,150 --> 02:35:39,410
.

4125
02:35:39,410 --> 02:35:39,630
.

4126
02:35:39,630 --> 02:35:39,890
.

4127
02:35:39,890 --> 02:35:39,970
.

4128
02:35:51,970 --> 02:35:53,950
Guys, that was a close match.

4129
02:35:54,150 --> 02:35:55,450
Oh my god, that was so close.

4130
02:35:55,570 --> 02:35:57,090
I was so scared guys.

4131
02:35:57,090 --> 02:35:59,890
Holy shit, that was so close.

4132
02:36:00,070 --> 02:36:01,670
I thought I was gonna die.

4133
02:36:01,910 --> 02:36:02,490
I...

4134
02:36:03,090 --> 02:36:03,430
.

4135
02:36:05,850 --> 02:36:06,990
That's funny.

4136
02:36:07,650 --> 02:36:12,270
Wait, wait, first person to get up gets a share of the...

4137
02:36:12,270 --> 02:36:13,350
Holy... guys!

4138
02:36:13,690 --> 02:36:15,330
That was so scary.

4139
02:36:15,410 --> 02:36:19,530
I thought... guys, I thought I was fucking gonna die guys.

4140
02:36:19,850 --> 02:36:21,210
Oh my god!

4141
02:36:21,830 --> 02:36:23,510
That was so close.

4142
02:36:24,390 --> 02:36:25,070
.

4143
02:36:28,130 --> 02:36:31,490
That was so fucking close guys.

4144
02:36:32,230 --> 02:36:32,830
.

4145
02:36:32,830 --> 02:36:34,190
That was so fucking close guys.

4146
02:36:34,190 --> 02:36:36,030
My Tokimons did it again.

4147
02:36:36,630 --> 02:36:37,690
Alright, let's go.

4148
02:36:38,930 --> 02:36:40,790
Let's go to this guys.

4149
02:36:41,010 --> 02:36:42,150
Two calves, that's fine.

4150
02:36:42,610 --> 02:36:43,610
That's fine.

4151
02:36:46,230 --> 02:36:49,110
Broke out set to the Shadow Realm.

4152
02:36:49,350 --> 02:36:51,070
CJ, thank you for the super chat.

4153
02:36:51,150 --> 02:36:52,010
Thank you, thank you.

4154
02:36:52,010 --> 02:36:52,230
Thank you.

4155
02:36:53,570 --> 02:36:56,950
The immersion in the blue flame door.

4156
02:36:57,330 --> 02:36:57,570
.

4157
02:36:59,210 --> 02:37:00,930
Hey, are you a real person?

4158
02:37:01,850 --> 02:37:02,690
Hey there.

4159
02:37:04,630 --> 02:37:06,730
You must be a real person.

4160
02:37:07,750 --> 02:37:08,030
Hey.

4161
02:37:09,690 --> 02:37:10,250
.

4162
02:37:13,250 --> 02:37:13,810
.

4163
02:37:13,810 --> 02:37:17,330
Hey, Ready Fish 56971 Are you a real person?

4164
02:37:18,750 --> 02:37:19,310
Hey.

4165
02:37:19,970 --> 02:37:20,970
Are you real?

4166
02:37:22,010 --> 02:37:23,950
Are you not part of the Tokimons?

4167
02:37:24,350 --> 02:37:24,950
Are you?

4168
02:37:25,090 --> 02:37:26,370
You must be real.

4169
02:37:26,470 --> 02:37:28,730
Oh my god, this is a real player.

4170
02:37:29,750 --> 02:37:32,210
Holy shit, it's a real player.

4171
02:37:32,430 --> 02:37:40,530
If you are not a real player, If you are not a real player, Give me the, give me the the Doki Bird, the Doki Bird emote.

4172
02:37:40,930 --> 02:37:43,130
Oh my god, this is a real player.

4173
02:37:43,210 --> 02:37:43,750
Oh my god, this is a real player.

4174
02:37:43,750 --> 02:37:46,110
A real person in this game.

4175
02:37:46,570 --> 02:37:48,210
Oh my god.

4176
02:37:48,430 --> 02:37:48,910
.

4177
02:37:48,910 --> 02:37:49,170
.

4178
02:37:53,630 --> 02:37:54,190
.

4179
02:37:54,190 --> 02:37:56,550
He must be so confused.

4180
02:37:57,090 --> 02:37:57,490
.

4181
02:37:59,990 --> 02:38:04,070
They are just like, what the fuck is going on?

4182
02:38:04,630 --> 02:38:05,190
Alright.

4183
02:38:07,130 --> 02:38:07,690
Okay.

4184
02:38:08,530 --> 02:38:09,230
Let's see.

4185
02:38:09,370 --> 02:38:10,230
No way.

4186
02:38:10,370 --> 02:38:10,890
Real?

4187
02:38:11,610 --> 02:38:13,370
Okay, I need to figure out where...

4188
02:38:13,370 --> 02:38:15,050
That's this way, okay.

4189
02:38:15,050 --> 02:38:18,250
The Duchess's home is this way.

4190
02:38:19,110 --> 02:38:22,810
The Doki Monster NPC confirmed.

4191
02:38:23,410 --> 02:38:24,450
The Doki Monster NPC confirmed.

4192
02:38:24,450 --> 02:38:24,490
The Doki Monster NPC confirmed.

4193
02:38:25,610 --> 02:38:26,910
Okay, enter alone.

4194
02:38:27,470 --> 02:38:28,450
Okay, enter alone.

4195
02:38:28,470 --> 02:38:29,470
That's crazy.

4196
02:38:30,210 --> 02:38:33,870
There's a person that has no idea what's going on that's in my server.

4197
02:38:34,470 --> 02:38:35,830
Troy, thank you for the super chat.

4198
02:38:35,910 --> 02:38:36,770
Thank you, thank you.

4199
02:38:36,790 --> 02:38:37,450
Free radical.

4200
02:38:37,590 --> 02:38:40,670
I know I'm surrounded, but I'm taking my chances to rob you.

4201
02:38:40,730 --> 02:38:41,690
I did it Duchess.

4202
02:38:41,710 --> 02:38:42,610
It was so difficult.

4203
02:38:43,170 --> 02:38:44,750
I had a little like...

4204
02:38:44,750 --> 02:38:47,430
I had a little like...

4205
02:38:47,430 --> 02:38:48,110
a little delay.

4206
02:38:48,750 --> 02:38:50,970
Because we were checking out some cribs.

4207
02:38:52,130 --> 02:38:53,410
Was that weird?

4208
02:38:53,530 --> 02:38:55,850
I just got sidetracked a little.

4209
02:38:56,570 --> 02:38:59,370
That's like they're headquartered at West Virginia Company.

4210
02:39:00,890 --> 02:39:01,490
Fantastic.

4211
02:39:03,090 --> 02:39:05,110
So that's where their boss will be.

4212
02:39:05,930 --> 02:39:07,410
You just need to...

4213
02:39:08,310 --> 02:39:09,230
Wait, wait, wait.

4214
02:39:09,230 --> 02:39:10,530
West Virginia Lumber?

4215
02:39:10,950 --> 02:39:12,190
Yeah, West Virginia.

4216
02:39:12,550 --> 02:39:13,870
You misheard them for sure.

4217
02:39:14,190 --> 02:39:15,570
And that's of concern.

4218
02:39:15,870 --> 02:39:17,250
Why exactly?

4219
02:39:18,150 --> 02:39:20,870
Was wandering up that way not too far back.

4220
02:39:21,010 --> 02:39:22,230
The lumber company?

4221
02:39:22,470 --> 02:39:26,050
That place was overrun with a bunch of those big green bastards.

4222
02:39:27,030 --> 02:39:27,630
Mutants.

4223
02:39:29,370 --> 02:39:30,710
I've seen those Frankensteins.

4224
02:39:30,750 --> 02:39:33,670
If this gang was able to clean those things out of the mill...

4225
02:39:33,670 --> 02:39:37,310
Duchess, these guys might be tougher than advertised.

4226
02:39:37,830 --> 02:39:38,790
They're gonna be tougher?

4227
02:39:39,210 --> 02:39:41,850
You got any recommendations on how you'd proceed?

4228
02:39:42,990 --> 02:39:44,610
Well I wouldn't go in guns blazing.

4229
02:39:44,710 --> 02:39:46,850
Unless you got some big guns.

4230
02:39:47,030 --> 02:39:50,910
Oh, I have some big guns more don't you worry.

4231
02:39:52,770 --> 02:39:55,830
...that I'm sure has had to deal with them already.

4232
02:39:56,110 --> 02:39:59,690
There was also this, let's say, special scrapper.

4233
02:39:59,810 --> 02:40:02,610
Oh, we definitely got some big guns.

4234
02:40:04,490 --> 02:40:06,970
Wouldn't be a bad idea to check in with either of them.

4235
02:40:08,490 --> 02:40:08,950
Alright.

4236
02:40:10,310 --> 02:40:12,030
Tell me about this family.

4237
02:40:12,230 --> 02:40:12,510
Yeah.

4238
02:40:12,730 --> 02:40:16,850
You'll find them at Anchor Farm if these thugs haven't already run them off.

4239
02:40:16,990 --> 02:40:21,830
But if they are still there, well, they probably managed to work something out with them.

4240
02:40:22,110 --> 02:40:24,550
Hey, it couldn't hurt to find out what it was.

4241
02:40:24,930 --> 02:40:25,390
What?

4242
02:40:26,590 --> 02:40:27,630
What about the scrapper?

4243
02:40:27,830 --> 02:40:29,910
The family living in the stalls at Tyler County Fairground.

4244
02:40:30,290 --> 02:40:33,530
Guy kept claiming you knew the best way to run the mutants out of the mill.

4245
02:40:33,790 --> 02:40:36,350
But, listen, I couldn't get him this bill, Hal.

4246
02:40:36,490 --> 02:40:40,970
Probably have a better chance he'll share what he learned with someone who still has an entire face.

4247
02:40:42,590 --> 02:40:45,130
Oh, he's like racist to ghouls.

4248
02:40:45,230 --> 02:40:46,230
Well, that's a good thing.

4249
02:40:46,570 --> 02:40:48,130
Cause that's all I've got.

4250
02:40:48,310 --> 02:40:55,650
If you haven't already explored up that way, the fastest route back would be via Vault 76 and trekking north from there.

4251
02:40:55,850 --> 02:40:57,110
And take care of yourself, alright?

4252
02:40:57,390 --> 02:40:58,750
You're doing us a big one here.

4253
02:40:58,750 --> 02:40:59,110
Don't worry.

4254
02:40:59,370 --> 02:41:00,090
I got you.

4255
02:41:00,470 --> 02:41:02,390
Alright, time to kill the gang leader.

4256
02:41:02,890 --> 02:41:07,110
Guys, okay, and select any location you previously visited with fast travel.

4257
02:41:07,330 --> 02:41:08,150
Alright, guys!

4258
02:41:08,830 --> 02:41:09,870
Doki Bons!

4259
02:41:09,890 --> 02:41:11,610
We're gonna kill the gang leader!

4260
02:41:11,870 --> 02:41:13,210
We're gonna set a world record!

4261
02:41:13,730 --> 02:41:15,450
For fastest kill!

4262
02:41:17,250 --> 02:41:18,510
Oh my god, I'm level 5.

4263
02:41:18,750 --> 02:41:20,270
I'm like power-leveling so hard.

4264
02:41:22,310 --> 02:41:25,790
Those family better behavior, they're gonna get erased.

4265
02:41:26,430 --> 02:41:27,550
My Doki Bons!

4266
02:41:27,930 --> 02:41:30,130
It's time to kill the gang leader!

4267
02:41:30,990 --> 02:41:31,970
Where he at?

4268
02:41:34,970 --> 02:41:37,230
Alright, search for traces.

4269
02:41:38,090 --> 02:41:38,650
Vault.

4270
02:41:39,330 --> 02:41:40,970
Travel back to the...

4271
02:41:40,970 --> 02:41:41,730
Vault is here.

4272
02:41:42,330 --> 02:41:44,070
And then optional.

4273
02:41:44,610 --> 02:41:46,150
Speak to the scrapper.

4274
02:41:46,710 --> 02:41:48,030
Kill the gang leader.

4275
02:41:48,190 --> 02:41:50,050
Okay, tech's house is the closest.

4276
02:41:50,470 --> 02:41:52,310
Alright, we're gonna go to tech's house.

4277
02:41:52,510 --> 02:41:53,010
I have so...

4278
02:41:53,010 --> 02:41:55,130
Oh my god, it's for free too!

4279
02:41:55,130 --> 02:41:56,170
Tech!

4280
02:41:56,630 --> 02:41:57,490
Thank you!

4281
02:41:59,670 --> 02:42:00,870
It's for free!

4282
02:42:01,030 --> 02:42:03,970
I don't have to actually pay for your house!

4283
02:42:05,550 --> 02:42:07,310
Thank fucking god!

4284
02:42:08,810 --> 02:42:10,110
Bro, what the fuck?

4285
02:42:10,130 --> 02:42:11,270
Look at this little cottage!

4286
02:42:12,250 --> 02:42:13,270
Holy shit!

4287
02:42:14,290 --> 02:42:15,530
Look at this cottage!

4288
02:42:15,790 --> 02:42:17,710
They have a vault house here.

4289
02:42:17,810 --> 02:42:19,070
Oh my god, it's like...

4290
02:42:20,170 --> 02:42:21,490
Switch power pilot.

4291
02:42:21,690 --> 02:42:22,330
Oh wait, whoops.

4292
02:42:22,490 --> 02:42:24,290
It's like they're fucking... it's like...

4293
02:42:25,130 --> 02:42:28,110
It's like the... the nuclear bombs never hit.

4294
02:42:30,270 --> 02:42:32,830
Oh my god, look how comfy this guy's...

4295
02:42:32,830 --> 02:42:35,150
Oh my god, he has a dog!

4296
02:42:36,290 --> 02:42:36,850
Look!

4297
02:42:38,670 --> 02:42:41,410
It's... what the fuck is a robot dog?

4298
02:42:42,010 --> 02:42:45,760
Oh my...

4299
02:42:45,760 --> 02:42:47,480
He even has a dog!

4300
02:42:48,020 --> 02:42:49,240
That's so cute!

4301
02:42:50,440 --> 02:42:51,480
Let's see...

4302
02:42:51,480 --> 02:42:53,600
Oh my god, let's break into this man's house.

4303
02:42:55,580 --> 02:42:56,780
Where's you... Are you the wife?

4304
02:42:58,160 --> 02:42:58,640
Husband?

4305
02:42:59,640 --> 02:43:01,940
Oh, I thought I heard someone around here.

4306
02:43:02,120 --> 02:43:04,480
Oh my god, he even has like a wife!

4307
02:43:06,380 --> 02:43:07,500
Oh my god, this...

4308
02:43:07,500 --> 02:43:09,920
We're just breaking into people's homes right now.

4309
02:43:10,560 --> 02:43:11,040
Doggo!

4310
02:43:11,100 --> 02:43:12,940
Oh, it's like a work in progress!

4311
02:43:13,100 --> 02:43:16,580
He has nothing on... Whoa, where do you and your wife sleep though?

4312
02:43:16,880 --> 02:43:18,260
Where do you guys sleep?

4313
02:43:18,320 --> 02:43:19,020
On the floor?

4314
02:43:19,360 --> 02:43:20,440
You live like this?

4315
02:43:20,540 --> 02:43:21,900
Whoa, what the fuck?

4316
02:43:22,800 --> 02:43:23,760
Murloc steamer?

4317
02:43:23,900 --> 02:43:24,700
Is this food?

4318
02:43:26,280 --> 02:43:28,220
I don't have the skill for this.

4319
02:43:28,460 --> 02:43:29,440
How do I level up?

4320
02:43:29,440 --> 02:43:30,080
Oh, level up.

4321
02:43:30,680 --> 02:43:31,220
Okay.

4322
02:43:32,860 --> 02:43:33,400
Uh...

4323
02:43:33,400 --> 02:43:35,480
Team up, work together.

4324
02:43:35,800 --> 02:43:36,560
Do you have reach level?

4325
02:43:36,640 --> 02:43:41,600
Disable pacifist mode game settings to enable player combat.

4326
02:43:42,900 --> 02:43:43,440
Um...

4327
02:43:44,260 --> 02:43:46,440
All damage is ignored, please.

4328
02:43:46,940 --> 02:43:49,700
All damage is ignored, please.

4329
02:43:49,740 --> 02:43:50,280
Yes!

4330
02:43:50,860 --> 02:43:50,920
Yes!

4331
02:43:50,920 --> 02:43:51,100
Oh!

4332
02:43:56,280 --> 02:43:56,960
What's this?

4333
02:43:57,760 --> 02:43:59,220
Oh, I got...

4334
02:43:59,220 --> 02:44:01,280
Christine broke her neck six years ago.

4335
02:44:01,300 --> 02:44:02,580
She never looked back.

4336
02:44:02,680 --> 02:44:02,940
Hehe.

4337
02:44:03,540 --> 02:44:05,080
Oh, I have cards!

4338
02:44:05,840 --> 02:44:07,080
Okay, we're gonna...

4339
02:44:07,080 --> 02:44:08,280
We're gonna be more lucky.

4340
02:44:09,400 --> 02:44:10,520
Luck is measured.

4341
02:44:10,660 --> 02:44:10,960
Oh yeah!

4342
02:44:11,100 --> 02:44:11,700
Luck, please.

4343
02:44:12,080 --> 02:44:14,980
40% fine extra first aid chems.

4344
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:15,320
Oh!

4345
02:44:16,360 --> 02:44:16,880
Yes!

4346
02:44:18,740 --> 02:44:19,620
I like that.

4347
02:44:22,860 --> 02:44:23,380
Um...

4348
02:44:24,980 --> 02:44:25,760
Let's see.

4349
02:44:25,860 --> 02:44:26,840
I don't think...

4350
02:44:27,220 --> 02:44:27,620
Wait, no.

4351
02:44:28,040 --> 02:44:29,340
No, we don't need that.

4352
02:44:29,600 --> 02:44:30,340
What about charisma?

4353
02:44:31,680 --> 02:44:32,640
Happy camper.

4354
02:44:32,740 --> 02:44:35,380
Hunger goes slower when you're on a team with others.

4355
02:44:35,560 --> 02:44:36,660
Gain 5%?

4356
02:44:37,020 --> 02:44:38,140
Wait, I like that.

4357
02:44:41,740 --> 02:44:42,260
Alright.

4358
02:44:42,260 --> 02:44:42,780
Nice.

4359
02:44:43,920 --> 02:44:45,140
Use two cards to...

4360
02:44:45,140 --> 02:44:45,360
Yeah!

4361
02:44:45,800 --> 02:44:47,280
Let's create a high-skilled one!

4362
02:44:47,720 --> 02:44:48,580
And then...

4363
02:44:48,580 --> 02:44:49,500
Maybe intelligence.

4364
02:44:50,800 --> 02:44:52,120
No, actually, no.

4365
02:44:52,160 --> 02:44:52,760
Not intelligence.

4366
02:44:53,240 --> 02:44:54,040
What about endurance?

4367
02:44:54,680 --> 02:44:56,060
All drink first.

4368
02:44:56,140 --> 02:44:58,140
Your chance to catch a disease from food.

4369
02:44:58,280 --> 02:45:01,040
All food satisfies hunger by an additional...

4370
02:45:01,040 --> 02:45:01,200
Ooh!

4371
02:45:01,400 --> 02:45:01,880
Okay.

4372
02:45:02,120 --> 02:45:03,700
Wait, actually, I should get less radiated.

4373
02:45:03,900 --> 02:45:04,780
Wait, actually, no.

4374
02:45:05,020 --> 02:45:08,140
There's no way my dragoons will feed me, like, radiation.

4375
02:45:09,180 --> 02:45:09,680
Um...

4376
02:45:09,680 --> 02:45:11,220
Okay, you need to equip them.

4377
02:45:11,340 --> 02:45:11,640
Okay.

4378
02:45:12,220 --> 02:45:13,640
Alright, we're gonna equip this.

4379
02:45:14,060 --> 02:45:15,840
We're not gonna equip that.

4380
02:45:16,300 --> 02:45:18,080
Root twice as much from harvesting.

4381
02:45:18,480 --> 02:45:19,960
Fast now target limbs.

4382
02:45:20,120 --> 02:45:20,840
Focus fire.

4383
02:45:21,100 --> 02:45:22,140
The weight of all...

4384
02:45:22,140 --> 02:45:23,220
Okay, nice.

4385
02:45:23,440 --> 02:45:24,020
We need to...

4386
02:45:24,040 --> 02:45:24,380
No!

4387
02:45:25,960 --> 02:45:27,000
What is this?

4388
02:45:27,140 --> 02:45:28,160
A strength, right?

4389
02:45:28,700 --> 02:45:29,380
No!

4390
02:45:30,460 --> 02:45:32,440
I wanna put this on!

4391
02:45:34,500 --> 02:45:35,600
Okay, wait.

4392
02:45:35,800 --> 02:45:37,860
We don't need... You know what?

4393
02:45:38,120 --> 02:45:39,600
We don't...

4394
02:45:40,320 --> 02:45:41,000
No!

4395
02:45:41,720 --> 02:45:43,260
Why can't I equip it?

4396
02:45:43,440 --> 02:45:44,840
It's level seven!

4397
02:45:51,750 --> 02:45:53,330
Oh my god.

4398
02:45:53,590 --> 02:45:55,650
I can't believe it.

4399
02:45:56,010 --> 02:45:57,010
Alright, guys.

4400
02:45:57,110 --> 02:45:57,610
It's time.

4401
02:45:59,650 --> 02:46:02,350
We're gonna fucking go and kill the leader.

4402
02:46:02,970 --> 02:46:04,510
I'm too weak!

4403
02:46:05,270 --> 02:46:09,010
But I buffed so much of my arms!

4404
02:46:11,030 --> 02:46:13,310
My arms were so thick!

4405
02:46:13,770 --> 02:46:14,870
Why is...

4406
02:46:14,870 --> 02:46:16,430
Why am I too weak?

4407
02:46:16,610 --> 02:46:17,250
Holy fuck.

4408
02:46:18,510 --> 02:46:20,310
Maybe I should have gotten agility.

4409
02:46:20,570 --> 02:46:21,370
What the fuck?

4410
02:46:21,650 --> 02:46:25,530
I feel like I'm not starving or, like, being thirsty right now.

4411
02:46:26,230 --> 02:46:27,350
Okay, it's this way.

4412
02:46:27,430 --> 02:46:27,790
Okay, I'm gonna go this way.

4413
02:46:27,810 --> 02:46:29,350
Guys, we can deal with this gang.

4414
02:46:29,430 --> 02:46:31,470
We do not need to travel anywhere.

4415
02:46:35,790 --> 02:46:39,690
We are not convincing the gang leader to leave.

4416
02:46:39,970 --> 02:46:41,630
It's a bloodbath.

4417
02:46:43,830 --> 02:46:46,950
We don't need to convince anybody.

4418
02:46:47,390 --> 02:46:49,550
We are not turning off pacifists.

4419
02:46:49,850 --> 02:46:50,430
I am...

4420
02:46:50,430 --> 02:46:53,270
I do not trust...

4421
02:46:53,510 --> 02:47:04,970
Guys, despite, you know, despite having an army of dookiemon's, I 100% do not trust any of them to, like, not stab me in the back.

4422
02:47:05,110 --> 02:47:06,230
Right now.

4423
02:47:07,370 --> 02:47:09,290
Don't be a coward.

4424
02:47:09,530 --> 02:47:09,990
Bro!

4425
02:47:10,190 --> 02:47:12,950
They were throwing in nukes!

4426
02:47:13,070 --> 02:47:16,110
What the fuck do you mean, don't be a coward?

4427
02:47:16,730 --> 02:47:18,610
Come on, shoot them.

4428
02:47:19,810 --> 02:47:22,410
I will die so fast!

4429
02:47:22,630 --> 02:47:24,690
And you all know it!

4430
02:47:25,430 --> 02:47:26,650
Look at this one!

4431
02:47:29,170 --> 02:47:32,290
Yes, you guys think I'll be okay, guys?

4432
02:47:34,610 --> 02:47:35,210
What?

4433
02:47:41,730 --> 02:47:42,330
What?

4434
02:47:42,830 --> 02:47:45,550
Who sent the nuke?

4435
02:47:48,370 --> 02:47:49,890
Who sent the nuke?

4436
02:47:49,950 --> 02:47:50,990
Who sent the nuke?

4437
02:47:51,130 --> 02:47:51,410
Oh!

4438
02:47:53,510 --> 02:47:54,110
Oh!

4439
02:47:56,990 --> 02:47:57,550
We gotta go!

4440
02:47:59,670 --> 02:48:01,150
I'm trying to leave!

4441
02:48:03,410 --> 02:48:05,210
Oh my god, where is it?

4442
02:48:05,350 --> 02:48:06,570
Where is that?

4443
02:48:06,630 --> 02:48:06,830
No!

4444
02:48:07,390 --> 02:48:08,850
Someone did the end!

4445
02:48:09,930 --> 02:48:10,810
Where is it?

4446
02:48:11,310 --> 02:48:12,070
Oh, we're okay.

4447
02:48:12,110 --> 02:48:12,550
We're safe.

4448
02:48:12,590 --> 02:48:12,990
We're safe.

4449
02:48:13,190 --> 02:48:14,570
They're not nuking us, guys.

4450
02:48:14,650 --> 02:48:15,130
We're okay.

4451
02:48:15,410 --> 02:48:16,490
Guys, we're okay.

4452
02:48:17,470 --> 02:48:18,750
We're safe, guys.

4453
02:48:19,210 --> 02:48:20,730
Holy fuck!

4454
02:48:21,170 --> 02:48:23,270
Who fucking...

4455
02:48:23,270 --> 02:48:24,330
Did they send it?

4456
02:48:24,630 --> 02:48:26,510
Can they send nukes?

4457
02:48:26,990 --> 02:48:28,170
Oh my god!

4458
02:48:30,830 --> 02:48:33,310
Someone did the funniest...

4459
02:48:33,310 --> 02:48:33,930
We'll be fine.

4460
02:48:34,230 --> 02:48:35,750
We'll be okay.

4461
02:48:37,930 --> 02:48:40,790
You can send in nukes?

4462
02:48:42,930 --> 02:48:44,850
Holy fuck!

4463
02:48:50,770 --> 02:48:52,770
Oh my god!

4464
02:48:52,770 --> 02:48:54,350
I can't believe it!

4465
02:48:54,350 --> 02:48:58,550
I can't believe somebody sent in a fucking nuke!

4466
02:48:59,790 --> 02:49:01,310
I can't believe somebody sent in a fucking nuke!

4467
02:49:01,330 --> 02:49:02,710
I told you!

4468
02:49:02,750 --> 02:49:07,230
This is exactly why I am not turning on PvP!

4469
02:49:07,810 --> 02:49:08,890
This is exactly why I am not turning on PvP!

4470
02:49:08,890 --> 02:49:10,050
This is exactly why!

4471
02:49:13,510 --> 02:49:15,550
Chat, I told you!

4472
02:49:18,110 --> 02:49:23,230
Dude, those poor level ones that just came out of the vault!

4473
02:49:25,850 --> 02:49:28,070
They just had to make sure!

4474
02:49:28,170 --> 02:49:29,330
This is where they live.

4475
02:49:30,430 --> 02:49:31,290
I think.

4476
02:49:31,430 --> 02:49:32,690
This is where they live, right?

4477
02:49:33,750 --> 02:49:34,630
This is it.

4478
02:49:36,290 --> 02:49:37,790
They used to live here.

4479
02:49:38,630 --> 02:49:39,570
What the fuck?

4480
02:49:39,970 --> 02:49:41,270
Okay, guys.

4481
02:49:41,510 --> 02:49:43,550
These people used to live here.

4482
02:49:44,010 --> 02:49:46,270
Send another one!

4483
02:49:49,190 --> 02:49:51,130
You get an achievement!

4484
02:49:52,410 --> 02:49:54,110
Oh my god!

4485
02:49:54,110 --> 02:49:55,730
Alright, guys.

4486
02:49:55,930 --> 02:49:56,710
Here we go!

4487
02:49:57,390 --> 02:49:59,290
I believe in all of you!

4488
02:49:59,910 --> 02:50:01,630
Can I get stuck here?

4489
02:50:01,750 --> 02:50:02,730
I discovered it.

4490
02:50:03,170 --> 02:50:03,650
Alright.

4491
02:50:05,250 --> 02:50:06,090
Here we go.

4492
02:50:08,790 --> 02:50:09,990
I'm here to talk to you.

4493
02:50:10,050 --> 02:50:10,750
God delivery.

4494
02:50:10,970 --> 02:50:11,770
Lots of it.

4495
02:50:12,370 --> 02:50:13,530
...execute this moron.

4496
02:50:14,970 --> 02:50:15,690
Alright, guys.

4497
02:50:15,770 --> 02:50:16,190
Let's start.

4498
02:50:16,330 --> 02:50:16,650
Let's go.

4499
02:50:17,590 --> 02:50:18,230
It's time.

4500
02:50:20,010 --> 02:50:20,970
Go, Madokibons!

4501
02:50:21,290 --> 02:50:21,750
Go!

4502
02:50:25,290 --> 02:50:26,970
Is the nuke still there?

4503
02:50:27,230 --> 02:50:28,590
Is the nuke still there?

4504
02:50:28,590 --> 02:50:29,750
Tune into the...

4505
02:50:31,390 --> 02:50:33,210
Okay, I need to tune into this radio.

4506
02:50:33,510 --> 02:50:34,770
Okay, I need to tune into this radio.

4507
02:50:34,770 --> 02:50:35,790
Tune into the...

4508
02:50:35,790 --> 02:50:36,750
Oh, I can't.

4509
02:50:37,390 --> 02:50:38,850
I can't tune it in.

4510
02:50:38,970 --> 02:50:39,870
Did I do it?

4511
02:50:40,130 --> 02:50:41,030
Where's the leader?

4512
02:50:41,490 --> 02:50:42,570
Where's the gang leader?

4513
02:50:45,230 --> 02:50:46,010
Right here?

4514
02:50:46,910 --> 02:50:47,790
Alright, guys.

4515
02:50:47,850 --> 02:50:48,430
It's time.

4516
02:50:49,530 --> 02:50:50,610
Guys, it's time.

4517
02:50:51,990 --> 02:50:53,110
It's time, guys.

4518
02:50:54,110 --> 02:50:54,510
Let's start the mission.

4519
02:50:55,390 --> 02:50:56,350
Alright, here we go.

4520
02:50:56,410 --> 02:50:57,490
I have to enter solo?

4521
02:50:58,430 --> 02:50:59,510
Okay, here we go.

4522
02:50:59,690 --> 02:51:00,810
I can do this, guys.

4523
02:51:01,270 --> 02:51:02,410
I can do this.

4524
02:51:08,540 --> 02:51:09,140
Hello?

4525
02:51:12,260 --> 02:51:12,860
Hello?

4526
02:51:14,880 --> 02:51:16,080
I didn't...

4527
02:51:16,080 --> 02:51:18,340
I didn't calculate not having...

4528
02:51:18,340 --> 02:51:20,300
my Dokimons here.

4529
02:51:20,980 --> 02:51:23,340
I did not calculate for this.

4530
02:51:24,540 --> 02:51:27,000
I did not calculate for this.

4531
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:27,700
Woah!

4532
02:51:30,420 --> 02:51:31,660
What the fuck?

4533
02:51:32,060 --> 02:51:32,240
What the fuck?

4534
02:51:33,320 --> 02:51:34,420
Oh, shit!

4535
02:51:35,960 --> 02:51:38,440
Guys, I didn't calculate for this!

4536
02:51:42,120 --> 02:51:42,580
Guys, I didn't calculate for this!

4537
02:51:42,580 --> 02:51:43,820
Is that the nuke outside?

4538
02:51:44,300 --> 02:51:44,760
Is that the nuke outside?

4539
02:51:46,880 --> 02:51:48,440
Guys, I think that was the...

4540
02:51:48,440 --> 02:51:48,620
Guys, I think that was the...

4541
02:51:48,620 --> 02:51:49,360
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

4542
02:51:50,840 --> 02:51:51,300
Okay.

4543
02:51:51,720 --> 02:51:52,880
Guys, guys, I need a heal.

4544
02:51:53,100 --> 02:51:54,120
I need a heal.

4545
02:51:55,300 --> 02:51:57,520
Guys, I think that was the nuke outside.

4546
02:51:59,200 --> 02:51:59,680
Yeah!

4547
02:52:00,820 --> 02:52:01,980
I wanna see!

4548
02:52:02,760 --> 02:52:04,060
Guys, I'm gonna go back.

4549
02:52:04,100 --> 02:52:05,080
I wanna see the nuke.

4550
02:52:05,360 --> 02:52:06,460
What is...

4551
02:52:08,060 --> 02:52:09,220
I missed it!

4552
02:52:09,260 --> 02:52:09,500
No!

4553
02:52:16,690 --> 02:52:17,770
I wanna see!

4554
02:52:18,950 --> 02:52:19,830
Where's the nuke?

4555
02:52:20,330 --> 02:52:23,030
Guys, I didn't finish the mission but I wanna see the nuke.

4556
02:52:23,330 --> 02:52:24,970
Oh, there... Wait, where is it?

4557
02:52:25,950 --> 02:52:26,770
Is it gone?

4558
02:52:27,810 --> 02:52:29,010
Guys, where's the nuke?

4559
02:52:30,570 --> 02:52:31,090
No!

4560
02:52:31,350 --> 02:52:32,790
I missed it!

4561
02:52:33,430 --> 02:52:34,930
Guys, send another, guys!

4562
02:52:35,590 --> 02:52:37,470
But like, don't send it here!

4563
02:52:44,630 --> 02:52:46,990
But like... Oh, it's right here!

4564
02:52:47,330 --> 02:52:48,570
The bloodstone.

4565
02:52:49,230 --> 02:52:51,730
Wait, let's... Wait, actually...

4566
02:52:52,270 --> 02:52:53,490
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

4567
02:52:53,530 --> 02:52:54,490
I wanna check it out.

4568
02:52:56,550 --> 02:52:57,070
No!

4569
02:52:57,270 --> 02:52:58,490
I missed it!

4570
02:52:58,610 --> 02:52:59,930
Is it still going on?

4571
02:53:03,500 --> 02:53:04,100
Guys!

4572
02:53:05,860 --> 02:53:07,540
That's... Wait, how long is the cooldown?

4573
02:53:08,820 --> 02:53:10,020
How long...

4574
02:53:12,480 --> 02:53:14,240
How long is the cooldown?

4575
02:53:16,800 --> 02:53:17,400
No!

4576
02:53:22,840 --> 02:53:24,680
Guys, send another one!

4577
02:53:27,100 --> 02:53:28,860
It'll be so funny!

4578
02:53:29,880 --> 02:53:31,980
Who the fuck is the gang leader?

4579
02:53:34,320 --> 02:53:36,760
I was too busy doing this mission!

4580
02:53:38,580 --> 02:53:39,240
Just saying!

4581
02:53:40,420 --> 02:53:42,440
I lost the cooldown, guys!

4582
02:53:42,720 --> 02:53:43,260
This is important!

4583
02:53:43,440 --> 02:53:43,780
Oh, hey!

4584
02:53:44,220 --> 02:53:45,500
I can sell that!

4585
02:53:50,790 --> 02:53:51,670
Is that it?

4586
02:53:51,930 --> 02:53:53,750
Where the fuck is the gang leader?

4587
02:53:53,850 --> 02:53:54,570
Oh, it's down here.

4588
02:53:55,590 --> 02:53:56,110
Okay.

4589
02:53:56,890 --> 02:53:58,430
Oh, you have to go downstairs!

4590
02:53:59,370 --> 02:54:00,770
No one's heard from Batter.

4591
02:54:01,890 --> 02:54:03,970
Suspect he finally managed to get himself killed.

4592
02:54:03,970 --> 02:54:07,270
Better than a long shot anyway.

4593
02:54:07,910 --> 02:54:12,490
Always figured it'd take someone coloring with a full box of crayons to find us our prize.

4594
02:54:12,790 --> 02:54:13,430
Can we talk?

4595
02:54:13,770 --> 02:54:15,070
I almost shot him.

4596
02:54:15,450 --> 02:54:17,350
They're running a parade through here now?

4597
02:54:17,910 --> 02:54:21,950
You wanna tell me who the hell you are and what you want?

4598
02:54:22,170 --> 02:54:23,710
Two hours?!

4599
02:54:24,810 --> 02:54:26,210
I want you to leave.

4600
02:54:26,510 --> 02:54:29,450
I want you to leave the wayward alone.

4601
02:54:30,250 --> 02:54:32,350
And why exactly would I do that?

4602
02:54:32,670 --> 02:54:33,230
I don't know.

4603
02:54:34,510 --> 02:54:36,610
Um... because you'll be dead.

4604
02:54:37,350 --> 02:54:39,310
Sure we will, kiddo.

4605
02:54:39,390 --> 02:54:39,930
Yeah.

4606
02:54:42,370 --> 02:54:43,390
Oh, shit!

4607
02:54:44,850 --> 02:54:46,150
That's fucking right.

4608
02:54:47,310 --> 02:54:49,190
You should have listened to me.

4609
02:54:50,550 --> 02:54:52,150
That's fucking right.

4610
02:54:52,250 --> 02:54:53,250
I told you.

4611
02:54:55,190 --> 02:54:57,330
I told you you'd be dead!

4612
02:54:59,240 --> 02:55:00,810
It was that easy.

4613
02:55:04,470 --> 02:55:06,610
Leave the gang of men.

4614
02:55:06,710 --> 02:55:07,830
They're freeing me.

4615
02:55:07,950 --> 02:55:09,510
They should have taken me seriously.

4616
02:55:09,970 --> 02:55:13,470
I had a whole crowd of dokimons waiting outside.

4617
02:55:14,450 --> 02:55:17,350
That's the one way to do it.

4618
02:55:17,970 --> 02:55:19,950
I can't believe it!

4619
02:55:25,930 --> 02:55:27,930
Why are you a wind gun?

4620
02:55:28,010 --> 02:55:28,330
Exactly.

4621
02:55:28,590 --> 02:55:30,090
Leave the wayward alone!

4622
02:55:31,910 --> 02:55:33,330
That's fucking right.

4623
02:55:33,430 --> 02:55:34,250
Leave it alone!

4624
02:55:35,510 --> 02:55:37,070
You wanna see the new changelog?

4625
02:55:37,070 --> 02:55:37,810
Okay.

4626
02:55:38,570 --> 02:55:39,050
All right.

4627
02:55:39,050 --> 02:55:39,350
Later.

4628
02:55:39,410 --> 02:55:39,650
Later.

4629
02:55:39,690 --> 02:55:41,470
We'll end it with seeing the nuke.

4630
02:55:45,380 --> 02:55:46,280
There's a boss?

4631
02:55:46,480 --> 02:55:47,400
Is the boss still there?

4632
02:55:48,160 --> 02:55:48,840
Hello, guys?

4633
02:55:48,960 --> 02:55:49,840
I did it, guys!

4634
02:55:50,480 --> 02:55:51,760
I did it!

4635
02:55:51,880 --> 02:55:54,100
Give me a thumbs up, everybody!

4636
02:55:54,460 --> 02:55:56,420
I did it myself, guys!

4637
02:55:56,740 --> 02:55:58,620
I wanna crowd of thumbs up!

4638
02:55:59,280 --> 02:55:59,560
Yeah!

4639
02:56:00,840 --> 02:56:03,600
Applaud me for my good job!

4640
02:56:07,080 --> 02:56:08,800
Boost my ego!

4641
02:56:12,440 --> 02:56:15,560
Hey man, thank you for the five gifted chips.

4642
02:56:15,740 --> 02:56:16,820
Thank you, thank you.

4643
02:56:16,920 --> 02:56:18,180
Thank you, I needed that.

4644
02:56:20,940 --> 02:56:22,820
Okay, apparently people are here.

4645
02:56:22,940 --> 02:56:24,180
I'm gonna travel there.

4646
02:56:29,780 --> 02:56:30,260
Next.

4647
02:56:30,460 --> 02:56:31,940
Thank you for the super chat.

4648
02:56:32,060 --> 02:56:32,660
Thank you, thank you.

4649
02:56:32,740 --> 02:56:36,020
What cooldowns most likely do the players crashing the servers?

4650
02:56:36,020 --> 02:56:37,380
Holy shit!

4651
02:56:37,460 --> 02:56:39,320
Is this the radiated zone?

4652
02:56:40,480 --> 02:56:43,000
Alright guys, I'm here to check it out.

4653
02:56:43,460 --> 02:56:45,260
I wanna check out the nukes.

4654
02:56:45,600 --> 02:56:46,780
Am I here, right?

4655
02:56:46,880 --> 02:56:47,780
Am I heading the right way?

4656
02:56:48,020 --> 02:56:48,900
Is this it?

4657
02:56:49,660 --> 02:56:50,840
Is this where it...

4658
02:56:50,840 --> 02:56:52,080
Oh shit!

4659
02:56:52,360 --> 02:56:53,680
Oh shit!

4660
02:56:56,280 --> 02:56:59,800
Guys, what happens if I get full radiated?

4661
02:57:00,180 --> 02:57:01,700
It won't be that bad, right?

4662
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:04,620
Well I can... Am I gonna... Am I gonna...

4663
02:57:04,620 --> 02:57:05,840
Am I gonna...

4664
02:57:06,020 --> 02:57:06,840
Get something?

4665
02:57:08,100 --> 02:57:10,380
Guys, am I gonna grow tumors, guys?

4666
02:57:10,940 --> 02:57:12,920
How do I check... How do I...

4667
02:57:13,480 --> 02:57:14,980
Okay, I need to get Rad away.

4668
02:57:15,940 --> 02:57:17,260
How do I see it?

4669
02:57:19,540 --> 02:57:21,060
I need special equipment.

4670
02:57:21,560 --> 02:57:23,160
Guys, I'll be okay, right?

4671
02:57:27,780 --> 02:57:28,740
Guys, guys...

4672
02:57:28,740 --> 02:57:31,660
Oh, I'm gonna be like the Incredible Hulk!

4673
02:57:32,680 --> 02:57:33,160
Guys!

4674
02:57:33,260 --> 02:57:35,580
Okay guys, I don't have Rad away cause I...

4675
02:57:35,580 --> 02:57:38,080
threw it all the way... I didn't throw it all the way...

4676
02:57:38,080 --> 02:57:39,360
But like I...

4677
02:57:39,360 --> 02:57:40,540
Wait, no, I do!

4678
02:57:40,720 --> 02:57:41,320
Oh wait, nice.

4679
02:57:41,380 --> 02:57:42,160
I got Rad away.

4680
02:57:43,960 --> 02:57:44,980
Nice, I got it.

4681
02:57:45,060 --> 02:57:45,880
I'm okay now.

4682
02:57:47,600 --> 02:57:48,940
Guys, I'm okay now.

4683
02:57:49,440 --> 02:57:51,460
So how do I... go in?

4684
02:57:53,460 --> 02:57:54,380
Will I be okay?

4685
02:57:54,740 --> 02:57:55,600
I'm level 6!

4686
02:57:56,400 --> 02:57:57,880
I'm gonna... I'm gonna risk it.

4687
02:57:59,540 --> 02:58:00,440
It'll be fine.

4688
02:58:00,680 --> 02:58:03,280
It'll be fine if I like... eat Rad away.

4689
02:58:05,140 --> 02:58:06,380
Guys, it won't be fine.

4690
02:58:06,440 --> 02:58:08,680
I won't... wait, it's only plus 57.

4691
02:58:09,180 --> 02:58:10,680
Oh, it won't be fine!

4692
02:58:10,740 --> 02:58:11,260
It won't be...

4693
02:58:16,080 --> 02:58:17,000
So radiation!

4694
02:58:17,880 --> 02:58:18,340
No!

4695
02:58:26,030 --> 02:58:29,010
Guys, it was not fine, guys.

4696
02:58:34,190 --> 02:58:34,710
Guys...

4697
02:58:34,710 --> 02:58:36,710
It was...

4698
02:58:37,410 --> 02:58:39,550
Guys, don't loot me, guys!

4699
02:58:40,510 --> 02:58:41,810
Don't loot me!

4700
02:58:42,530 --> 02:58:45,210
I had so much items!

4701
02:58:46,510 --> 02:58:47,690
Do I have my items?

4702
02:58:47,790 --> 02:58:48,370
Do I keep it?

4703
02:58:49,430 --> 02:58:50,790
Do I keep my items?

4704
02:58:52,130 --> 02:58:54,230
I can't tell if I keep my items.

4705
02:58:55,270 --> 02:58:56,150
I do!

4706
02:58:56,270 --> 02:58:56,770
I do!

4707
02:58:56,850 --> 02:58:57,950
I'm okay, guys!

4708
02:58:58,730 --> 02:58:59,610
I'm okay!

4709
02:58:59,850 --> 02:59:01,030
Hello, dragoons.

4710
02:59:01,130 --> 02:59:02,010
I'm okay, guys!

4711
02:59:02,070 --> 02:59:03,030
See, I told you!

4712
02:59:03,630 --> 02:59:05,830
I'm... I basically became a superhero!

4713
02:59:06,730 --> 02:59:09,370
I knew the radiation would make me stronger!

4714
02:59:12,790 --> 02:59:14,510
I knew it!

4715
02:59:14,850 --> 02:59:19,450
I knew the radiation would make me stronger, guys!

4716
02:59:20,190 --> 02:59:21,930
Okay, let's get some Rad away.

4717
02:59:24,330 --> 02:59:25,750
Does it go faster?

4718
02:59:27,270 --> 02:59:29,630
Let's see... wait, a hazmat...

4719
02:59:29,630 --> 02:59:31,290
Wait, a hazmat suit!

4720
02:59:32,830 --> 02:59:33,930
Oh my god!

4721
02:59:36,710 --> 02:59:41,600
We got no idea how many uranium-k-molts in there.

4722
02:59:41,720 --> 02:59:43,140
Whoa, what a brotherhood.

4723
02:59:43,280 --> 02:59:43,800
God help us.

4724
02:59:43,960 --> 02:59:45,100
God help us.

4725
02:59:45,860 --> 02:59:47,880
Wait, nuclear strike imminent?

4726
02:59:48,260 --> 02:59:48,740
Again?

4727
02:59:51,940 --> 02:59:52,840
Oh, it's here!

4728
02:59:53,000 --> 02:59:54,300
Guys, guys, there's another one!

4729
02:59:55,120 --> 02:59:55,600
Guys!

4730
02:59:56,260 --> 02:59:56,860
Let's go!

4731
02:59:58,940 --> 02:59:59,900
Another nuke!

4732
03:00:04,340 --> 03:00:05,300
We gotta go!

4733
03:00:07,240 --> 03:00:07,720
Guys!

4734
03:00:07,740 --> 03:00:10,080
That's right, we're gonna run over and see it!

4735
03:00:13,260 --> 03:00:14,500
Oh my god, where is it?

4736
03:00:15,760 --> 03:00:16,920
We gotta go, guys!

4737
03:00:17,300 --> 03:00:18,440
We gotta see it!

4738
03:00:20,840 --> 03:00:21,880
The blast zone!

4739
03:00:24,700 --> 03:00:25,280
Okay, wait.

4740
03:00:25,460 --> 03:00:26,420
Am I going the right way?

4741
03:00:26,560 --> 03:00:27,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4742
03:00:28,400 --> 03:00:30,340
Oh my god, we gotta get in the blast zone.

4743
03:00:31,580 --> 03:00:32,640
Oh, put on the hazmat.

4744
03:00:32,660 --> 03:00:34,100
You're right, we gotta put on the hazmat.

4745
03:00:35,780 --> 03:00:36,140
Armor.

4746
03:00:36,140 --> 03:00:36,500
Apparel.

4747
03:00:37,480 --> 03:00:37,840
No!

4748
03:00:37,900 --> 03:00:39,880
I'm not- Guys!

4749
03:00:39,880 --> 03:00:40,760
Guys!

4750
03:00:41,600 --> 03:00:42,120
Guys!

4751
03:00:45,040 --> 03:00:51,060
Yeah, guys, I don't think we're gonna be putting on a hazmat suit anytime soon.

4752
03:00:55,880 --> 03:00:56,400
Guys.

4753
03:00:57,560 --> 03:00:59,340
Guys, I don't know, guys.

4754
03:00:59,500 --> 03:01:01,880
Oh my god, it's a naked mole rat.

4755
03:01:01,980 --> 03:01:03,240
Is he- Okay, he's not good.

4756
03:01:03,660 --> 03:01:05,840
He's not a nice naked mole rat.

4757
03:01:06,960 --> 03:01:09,360
Just get to level 50.

4758
03:01:11,460 --> 03:01:12,940
Okay, we're gonna make it.

4759
03:01:13,280 --> 03:01:14,500
We're gonna make it.

4760
03:01:16,360 --> 03:01:20,040
Okay, wait, we need a- Okay, I need a chain.

4761
03:01:20,300 --> 03:01:21,100
Rat away.

4762
03:01:21,660 --> 03:01:23,000
Where the fuck is rat away?

4763
03:01:23,240 --> 03:01:23,880
Oh, there it is.

4764
03:01:25,360 --> 03:01:27,120
Alright, we gotta get some rat away on.

4765
03:01:27,360 --> 03:01:28,360
Am I heading the right way?

4766
03:01:28,640 --> 03:01:29,660
Oh my god, this is it!

4767
03:01:30,600 --> 03:01:33,480
Alright, guys, we're gonna watch something beautiful!

4768
03:01:35,380 --> 03:01:36,260
Alright, here we go.

4769
03:01:37,380 --> 03:01:39,860
I dare- I dare one dragoon to go in the blast zone.

4770
03:01:43,540 --> 03:01:46,400
I double dare a dragoon to go in there.

4771
03:01:46,540 --> 03:01:48,420
You won't lose anything anyway, right?

4772
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:55,440
If you're a- If you are a true dragoon, you will get blasted by the nuclear bomb in front of me.

4773
03:01:56,840 --> 03:01:58,280
He's like, thumbs up.

4774
03:01:58,900 --> 03:01:59,960
I'm down, bro.

4775
03:02:05,680 --> 03:02:06,200
Let's go.

4776
03:02:06,620 --> 03:02:08,180
Give me a thumbs up back!

4777
03:02:09,860 --> 03:02:10,600
There's a dragoon over there!

4778
03:02:10,700 --> 03:02:11,900
Oh my god!

4779
03:02:11,960 --> 03:02:12,540
Is that it?

4780
03:02:14,360 --> 03:02:18,380
Is that the- Is that it?

4781
03:02:18,780 --> 03:02:19,560
Right there?

4782
03:02:20,220 --> 03:02:22,220
If I kill him, I'll kill him in the house.

4783
03:02:24,100 --> 03:02:25,100
What's that?

4784
03:02:25,460 --> 03:02:26,620
Oh my god.

4785
03:02:26,800 --> 03:02:28,220
Goodbye, dragoon.

4786
03:02:28,220 --> 03:02:29,160
You're a hero.

4787
03:02:29,500 --> 03:02:30,920
Oh shit!

4788
03:02:32,780 --> 03:02:33,660
Is he dead?

4789
03:02:33,840 --> 03:02:34,480
Oh, he's dead.

4790
03:02:37,040 --> 03:02:38,860
Oh yeah, he's definitely dead.

4791
03:02:39,860 --> 03:02:40,320
There it is!

4792
03:02:43,040 --> 03:02:45,040
Bro, I just watched a man die.

4793
03:02:47,580 --> 03:02:48,020
Woah!

4794
03:02:48,660 --> 03:02:53,140
And then you put your thumb up to see if you're in the bad part of the radiation.

4795
03:02:53,800 --> 03:02:55,560
I think I'm in the good part.

4796
03:02:55,840 --> 03:02:57,340
It's beautiful, like a sunset.

4797
03:02:58,240 --> 03:02:58,940
Look at that.

4798
03:02:59,580 --> 03:03:04,680
See, it's not bigger than my thumb right now, so it means like I won't get hurt by the radiation.

4799
03:03:07,300 --> 03:03:08,260
Everybody's fine, right?

4800
03:03:08,360 --> 03:03:09,180
We're all okay.

4801
03:03:10,120 --> 03:03:11,160
You're laughing.

4802
03:03:11,860 --> 03:03:13,360
That wasn't so bad.

4803
03:03:13,620 --> 03:03:14,420
We're all okay.

4804
03:03:15,200 --> 03:03:16,040
See guys?

4805
03:03:16,280 --> 03:03:17,840
It wasn't so bad.

4806
03:03:18,800 --> 03:03:22,100
The radiation hasn't even hit terminal yet, guys.

4807
03:03:22,240 --> 03:03:22,640
See?

4808
03:03:23,440 --> 03:03:25,200
You can walk around it.

4809
03:03:25,320 --> 03:03:26,760
Wait, wait, it is not bad.

4810
03:03:27,020 --> 03:03:27,500
Guys, look.

4811
03:03:27,560 --> 03:03:27,800
See?

4812
03:03:27,960 --> 03:03:28,960
It's not that bad.

4813
03:03:30,200 --> 03:03:30,720
Oh!

4814
03:03:31,340 --> 03:03:31,860
Oh!

4815
03:03:32,280 --> 03:03:33,980
Oh, it's getting bad, guys!

4816
03:03:34,180 --> 03:03:37,620
It's getting- I just know- Wait, okay.

4817
03:03:38,060 --> 03:03:40,120
Guys, I'll- It won't be okay.

4818
03:03:41,800 --> 03:03:42,680
They survived.

4819
03:03:45,320 --> 03:03:46,660
Someone's in the middle of it.

4820
03:03:46,720 --> 03:03:48,400
How did he get in the middle of the radiation?

4821
03:03:49,600 --> 03:03:51,080
How did you guys get here?

4822
03:03:54,140 --> 03:03:55,180
What the fuck?

4823
03:03:55,280 --> 03:03:56,120
What is this?

4824
03:03:56,280 --> 03:03:57,120
Oh, is this the event?

4825
03:03:57,900 --> 03:03:59,460
Oh, is this the event?

4826
03:03:59,540 --> 03:04:01,420
Wait for the mineshaft robot to clear?

4827
03:04:03,860 --> 03:04:05,220
Wait, this is the event.

4828
03:04:06,900 --> 03:04:07,340
Right?

4829
03:04:10,800 --> 03:04:12,140
Welcome to the underground.

4830
03:04:14,060 --> 03:04:15,160
A boss event!

4831
03:04:15,420 --> 03:04:17,160
I'm gonna follow the OS man.

4832
03:04:17,380 --> 03:04:18,700
He seems like he knows what he's doing.

4833
03:04:19,080 --> 03:04:19,640
Hey guys!

4834
03:04:20,120 --> 03:04:23,540
I might be level 5, but like, I'm tougher than you think.

4835
03:04:24,060 --> 03:04:26,000
Wait for the mineshaft ro- Was it here?

4836
03:04:26,360 --> 03:04:27,140
We wait here?

4837
03:04:27,960 --> 03:04:28,920
Guys, guys.

4838
03:04:29,760 --> 03:04:31,860
It's like, bring your kid to work day.

4839
03:04:37,000 --> 03:04:39,820
It's bring your kid to work day right now.

4840
03:04:41,620 --> 03:04:46,560
Guys, I might- I might be level 5, but I got moxie, guys.

4841
03:04:48,800 --> 03:04:50,660
You're a class- It's okay!

4842
03:04:51,180 --> 03:04:53,900
My teammates will be here to help me!

4843
03:04:54,460 --> 03:04:55,640
Next, thank you for the super chat.

4844
03:04:55,680 --> 03:04:56,380
Thank you, thank you.

4845
03:04:56,500 --> 03:04:59,940
By the way, most Fallout IRLs only radioactive for a few weeks.

4846
03:04:59,940 --> 03:05:04,140
A small amount of radiation for- A small amount is radioactive for 35 years.

4847
03:05:04,400 --> 03:05:06,900
It makes- It gets in your food, your body, things, it's calcium.

4848
03:05:07,040 --> 03:05:09,100
Your bones be- Oh, that's so cool!

4849
03:05:10,120 --> 03:05:13,260
What has- What has, uh, Sontium 90?

4850
03:05:13,540 --> 03:05:17,720
I wanna have radiated bones, but also not in a way where I can get cancer.

4851
03:05:19,340 --> 03:05:20,300
Guys, look!

4852
03:05:20,640 --> 03:05:21,220
Oh my god!

4853
03:05:21,240 --> 03:05:22,680
There's a level 20 here anyway!

4854
03:05:22,920 --> 03:05:23,520
We'll be fine!

4855
03:05:25,440 --> 03:05:26,780
I'm the Pokemon trainer.

4856
03:05:26,780 --> 03:05:29,840
Guys, I'm gonna be the Pokemon trainer.

4857
03:05:30,560 --> 03:05:32,160
We're gonna wait for this to clear out.

4858
03:05:33,220 --> 03:05:34,240
Death from above.

4859
03:05:34,360 --> 03:05:35,380
We completed it!

4860
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:38,620
That's not cool, Doki!

4861
03:05:40,260 --> 03:05:43,600
I should get Rado- I should take some Radoid, though.

4862
03:05:44,440 --> 03:05:45,380
It's okay, guys!

4863
03:05:47,280 --> 03:05:50,020
We have three people with power armor in front of me!

4864
03:05:50,380 --> 03:05:52,860
Am I the lowest leveled one- level- level here?

4865
03:05:53,260 --> 03:05:54,360
We'll be fine!

4866
03:05:58,180 --> 03:06:00,580
We'll be so fine!

4867
03:06:04,700 --> 03:06:06,620
I believe in us, guys!

4868
03:06:09,200 --> 03:06:10,980
We'll be okay, everybody!

4869
03:06:11,360 --> 03:06:16,500
We might be the lowest level here, but like, I believe in my team!

4870
03:06:16,940 --> 03:06:18,160
Ooh, I got pickaxe.

4871
03:06:18,420 --> 03:06:20,260
I like the, uh...

4872
03:06:20,260 --> 03:06:22,180
I should stop picking up items.

4873
03:06:22,360 --> 03:06:23,180
I can't help it.

4874
03:06:23,340 --> 03:06:25,580
I see loot and I wanna take it.

4875
03:06:26,780 --> 03:06:27,360
Oh my god.

4876
03:06:27,840 --> 03:06:31,060
I love, like, the- the environment around us, though.

4877
03:06:31,260 --> 03:06:31,640
Oh!

4878
03:06:33,500 --> 03:06:34,060
Alright.

4879
03:06:34,440 --> 03:06:35,740
One more minute, guys!

4880
03:06:35,960 --> 03:06:36,780
One more minute!

4881
03:06:39,220 --> 03:06:40,940
So- No, there's enough!

4882
03:06:41,600 --> 03:06:43,340
We li- we're having to level 1000!

4883
03:06:44,140 --> 03:06:45,200
Did he leave?

4884
03:06:45,580 --> 03:06:47,640
Did our level 1000 left us?

4885
03:06:48,100 --> 03:06:50,140
Bro, he's supposed to carry us!

4886
03:06:53,920 --> 03:06:55,260
I can't wait.

4887
03:06:55,260 --> 03:06:58,800
I can't wait to take all the- Guys, you'll give me all the loot, right?

4888
03:06:59,060 --> 03:07:00,880
And I'll never play this game again.

4889
03:07:01,120 --> 03:07:03,620
But, like, I- it's the thought that counts, you know?

4890
03:07:05,580 --> 03:07:08,200
This is a rough event.

4891
03:07:08,500 --> 03:07:08,960
No!

4892
03:07:09,160 --> 03:07:13,320
He's got- What happened to my army of dragoons?!

4893
03:07:13,320 --> 03:07:15,920
Where did you all go?!

4894
03:07:15,920 --> 03:07:23,000
Where did you- You hurt my vampire's feelings.

4895
03:07:26,580 --> 03:07:29,160
Guys, where did he go?!

4896
03:07:32,100 --> 03:07:32,500
Abandoned.

4897
03:07:32,500 --> 03:07:33,900
We lost soldiers.

4898
03:07:38,300 --> 03:07:38,700
Guys!

4899
03:07:41,220 --> 03:07:41,760
Let's go!

4900
03:07:41,800 --> 03:07:42,100
Let's go!

4901
03:07:42,120 --> 03:07:42,380
Let's go!

4902
03:07:42,440 --> 03:07:43,160
Front line, guys!

4903
03:07:43,240 --> 03:07:43,880
You're at the front line!

4904
03:07:44,140 --> 03:07:44,360
Go!

4905
03:07:44,420 --> 03:07:44,620
Go!

4906
03:07:44,680 --> 03:07:44,960
Go!

4907
03:07:44,960 --> 03:07:45,220
Go!

4908
03:07:45,220 --> 03:07:45,560
Go!

4909
03:07:46,360 --> 03:07:46,760
Go!

4910
03:07:46,760 --> 03:07:47,120
Go!

4911
03:07:47,260 --> 03:07:47,400
Go!

4912
03:07:47,540 --> 03:07:47,680
Go!

4913
03:07:47,860 --> 03:07:47,900
Go!

4914
03:07:50,140 --> 03:07:51,140
Oh, shit!

4915
03:07:51,240 --> 03:07:52,220
Wait, there's fall damage?

4916
03:07:52,760 --> 03:07:53,560
Oh, my god!

4917
03:07:53,600 --> 03:07:54,780
There's fall damage, guys!

4918
03:07:55,260 --> 03:07:55,660
Go!

4919
03:07:55,740 --> 03:07:55,900
Go!

4920
03:07:56,000 --> 03:07:56,160
Go!

4921
03:07:56,220 --> 03:07:56,480
Go!

4922
03:07:56,480 --> 03:07:56,720
Go!

4923
03:07:57,960 --> 03:07:59,120
Oh, what's this?

4924
03:07:59,860 --> 03:08:00,640
Oh, oh!

4925
03:08:00,660 --> 03:08:01,480
There's damages!

4926
03:08:03,660 --> 03:08:04,700
Go, dragoons!

4927
03:08:04,780 --> 03:08:05,080
Go!

4928
03:08:05,500 --> 03:08:06,160
What is that?

4929
03:08:06,620 --> 03:08:07,860
Earl Williams?

4930
03:08:08,580 --> 03:08:09,800
What is that?

4931
03:08:09,820 --> 03:08:14,560
Oh, is that the- Guys, I don't think I'm doing any damage, guys.

4932
03:08:15,520 --> 03:08:16,040
Help!

4933
03:08:17,600 --> 03:08:18,660
You're on fire!

4934
03:08:18,760 --> 03:08:20,360
You're in a power suit!

4935
03:08:20,960 --> 03:08:21,480
Guys!

4936
03:08:22,480 --> 03:08:24,000
Am I helping?

4937
03:08:24,820 --> 03:08:25,980
I'm helping, right?

4938
03:08:29,640 --> 03:08:32,020
I think I'm- I think I'm helping.

4939
03:08:33,980 --> 03:08:35,820
I'm doing my part!

4940
03:08:38,740 --> 03:08:40,020
Turn down- You know what?

4941
03:08:40,200 --> 03:08:41,000
I'll turn it on.

4942
03:08:41,140 --> 03:08:45,480
There's no way- There's no way he's gonna start hitting me the moment I tab into my menu.

4943
03:08:45,760 --> 03:08:46,600
What the fuck?

4944
03:08:46,660 --> 03:08:47,500
What's going on?

4945
03:08:48,140 --> 03:08:49,020
What's that sound?

4946
03:08:49,180 --> 03:08:50,440
Why did it get scary?

4947
03:08:50,880 --> 03:08:51,980
Guys, protect me.

4948
03:08:52,040 --> 03:08:55,380
I'm gonna turn on my- I'm gonna turn on my damage numbers.

4949
03:08:55,500 --> 03:08:57,300
I wanna know how much damage I do.

4950
03:08:57,880 --> 03:09:00,240
By how- My- Okay.

4951
03:09:01,260 --> 03:09:01,880
Let's see.

4952
03:09:02,660 --> 03:09:03,340
Damage number.

4953
03:09:03,840 --> 03:09:05,900
Guys, I- Please don't let him get near me.

4954
03:09:06,140 --> 03:09:08,000
I need to look at my damage numbers.

4955
03:09:08,480 --> 03:09:09,640
Show floating markers.

4956
03:09:09,960 --> 03:09:10,940
No, that's not it.

4957
03:09:11,340 --> 03:09:12,180
What is this?

4958
03:09:12,180 --> 03:09:13,000
Show damage numbers.

4959
03:09:13,080 --> 03:09:13,460
There we go.

4960
03:09:14,380 --> 03:09:15,240
Alright, let's see.

4961
03:09:17,160 --> 03:09:18,100
What the fuck was that?

4962
03:09:18,140 --> 03:09:18,960
What the fuck is that?

4963
03:09:20,580 --> 03:09:22,140
Oh, he was screaming at us!

4964
03:09:22,200 --> 03:09:22,400
Okay.

4965
03:09:26,680 --> 03:09:29,900
Guys, I am- Is that one or eleven?

4966
03:09:38,520 --> 03:09:39,540
I'm hoping.

4967
03:09:41,020 --> 03:09:42,920
Go, go, go, dragons!

4968
03:09:43,280 --> 03:09:45,080
Go, go, go, dragons!

4969
03:09:45,500 --> 03:09:46,660
You guys got this!

4970
03:09:47,440 --> 03:09:48,040
Yeah!

4971
03:09:49,620 --> 03:09:53,360
I believe- Yeah!

4972
03:09:56,620 --> 03:09:58,280
Oh my God!

4973
03:10:07,920 --> 03:10:09,000
We'll be fine.

4974
03:10:10,000 --> 03:10:10,920
We'll be fine.

4975
03:10:10,960 --> 03:10:11,740
Did we lose anybody?

4976
03:10:12,060 --> 03:10:13,580
Did we lose any dragons?

4977
03:10:13,980 --> 03:10:16,060
It's okay, I'm level 840.

4978
03:10:16,560 --> 03:10:17,360
Don't worry!

4979
03:10:17,800 --> 03:10:20,480
My one damage adds up!

4980
03:10:20,680 --> 03:10:23,620
If I keep shooting, it'll add up eventually.

4981
03:10:24,020 --> 03:10:24,140
Oh!

4982
03:10:25,400 --> 03:10:26,980
Don't worry, I have so much food.

4983
03:10:27,300 --> 03:10:29,900
I stocked up on so much food, guys.

4984
03:10:31,240 --> 03:10:33,500
Get back there, you cunties.

4985
03:10:35,720 --> 03:10:39,520
Guys, I just need to make sure I don't get hit, guys!

4986
03:10:40,000 --> 03:10:41,800
Make sure I don't get hit!

4987
03:10:42,020 --> 03:10:43,320
Protect the president!

4988
03:10:43,900 --> 03:10:45,860
It means you're number one.

4989
03:10:45,920 --> 03:10:46,400
Exactly!

4990
03:10:47,560 --> 03:10:50,180
Guys, we lost a lot of dragoons.

4991
03:10:50,600 --> 03:10:52,340
There's only four of us.

4992
03:10:52,440 --> 03:10:53,020
Oh wait, there's more!

4993
03:10:53,060 --> 03:10:53,440
There's more!

4994
03:10:53,600 --> 03:10:54,220
There's more!

4995
03:10:54,440 --> 03:10:55,760
Wally, Wanda is here!

4996
03:10:55,840 --> 03:10:57,540
Okay, I think we lost a lot though.

4997
03:10:57,800 --> 03:10:59,820
I'm pretty sure we had more.

4998
03:10:59,820 --> 03:11:06,580
I'm pretty sure... I think we actually had more before we...

4999
03:11:06,580 --> 03:11:14,180
Guys, I'm hoping... I'm hoping reinforcements have arrived.

5000
03:11:14,760 --> 03:11:16,140
Oh, thank god!

5001
03:11:16,520 --> 03:11:18,600
Oh, I actually shot the wrong one.

5002
03:11:18,720 --> 03:11:20,860
Thank god there's reinforcements.

5003
03:11:22,980 --> 03:11:24,020
Holy shit.

5004
03:11:24,080 --> 03:11:24,240
No!

5005
03:11:24,640 --> 03:11:25,660
Rad crab!

5006
03:11:25,840 --> 03:11:27,520

5007
03:11:28,060 --> 03:11:29,660
Bro, loss is like...

5008
03:11:29,660 --> 03:11:30,680

5009
03:11:30,920 --> 03:11:31,720
Look at him go!

5010
03:11:32,380 --> 03:11:34,500
Holy shit, look at this man go!

5011
03:11:35,000 --> 03:11:36,920
I'm gonna throw a grenade, guys.

5012
03:11:37,060 --> 03:11:38,060
I wanna throw a grenade.

5013
03:11:39,360 --> 03:11:41,620
The one that is yellow is my crit hit.

5014
03:11:41,660 --> 03:11:42,020
I know.

5015
03:11:42,140 --> 03:11:43,520
I can't believe it.

5016
03:11:44,140 --> 03:11:46,460
From one to one!

5017
03:11:47,120 --> 03:11:48,320
Holy shit!

5018
03:11:51,220 --> 03:11:52,380
I'm level seven!

5019
03:11:53,680 --> 03:11:54,240
Boys!

5020
03:11:54,760 --> 03:11:56,640
I'm level seven now!

5021
03:11:57,420 --> 03:11:59,560
I'm fucking gaming, guys.

5022
03:11:59,660 --> 03:12:01,880
Oh my god.

5023
03:12:02,440 --> 03:12:04,260
I'm doing twos!

5024
03:12:04,960 --> 03:12:06,680
Did you guys see that?

5025
03:12:07,180 --> 03:12:09,440
I'm doing twos!

5026
03:12:13,440 --> 03:12:14,160
Bro!

5027
03:12:15,460 --> 03:12:17,980
I got to twos, man!

5028
03:12:18,440 --> 03:12:19,880
I'm getting better!

5029
03:12:20,340 --> 03:12:22,860
It's like when I get like super lucky.

5030
03:12:25,940 --> 03:12:28,440
It adds up, alright?

5031
03:12:28,600 --> 03:12:29,640
It adds up.

5032
03:12:29,660 --> 03:12:31,440
It adds up in the end, guys.

5033
03:12:33,100 --> 03:12:34,000
Get up!

5034
03:12:34,020 --> 03:12:36,460
This is the best weapon I have!

5035
03:12:36,720 --> 03:12:38,580
This is literally the best one!

5036
03:12:39,020 --> 03:12:40,940
We can't get better!

5037
03:12:43,400 --> 03:12:46,120
We actually cannot get better!

5038
03:12:51,340 --> 03:12:53,220
This is our weapon!

5039
03:12:53,480 --> 03:12:56,700
Is the... wait, is the two-shot suppressed MF?

5040
03:12:56,700 --> 03:12:57,400
No!

5041
03:12:57,720 --> 03:12:58,920
I got you!

5042
03:12:59,840 --> 03:13:01,520
Did I... he gone.

5043
03:13:02,340 --> 03:13:03,800
I got you, Wally!

5044
03:13:04,260 --> 03:13:05,460
Wait, what the fuck?

5045
03:13:05,480 --> 03:13:06,140
You're just hiding.

5046
03:13:06,500 --> 03:13:08,980
I thought... alright.

5047
03:13:09,140 --> 03:13:10,180
Don't worry, we're fine.

5048
03:13:10,900 --> 03:13:12,300
We lost so many.

5049
03:13:12,760 --> 03:13:13,760
Oh no.

5050
03:13:14,440 --> 03:13:17,240
I swear there used to be more of us.

5051
03:13:17,540 --> 03:13:18,400
I swear...

5052
03:13:18,400 --> 03:13:19,140
Oh, behind us!

5053
03:13:19,160 --> 03:13:19,680
Behind us!

5054
03:13:19,740 --> 03:13:20,260
Protect me!

5055
03:13:20,320 --> 03:13:20,860
Protect me!

5056
03:13:20,980 --> 03:13:21,860
Protect me!

5057
03:13:24,320 --> 03:13:26,320
Guys, I'm only level seven!

5058
03:13:27,580 --> 03:13:28,380
Protect... No!

5059
03:13:28,960 --> 03:13:32,000
I said hundred!

5060
03:13:32,280 --> 03:13:33,620
Two hundred twenty-seven six!

5061
03:13:35,640 --> 03:13:36,560
Protect me!

5062
03:13:36,620 --> 03:13:37,160
Protect me!

5063
03:13:37,780 --> 03:13:40,160
I'm the most important one here!

5064
03:13:41,640 --> 03:13:42,360
Don't worry!

5065
03:13:43,280 --> 03:13:44,520
I got you!

5066
03:13:46,320 --> 03:13:47,860
Protect the queen.

5067
03:13:48,160 --> 03:13:50,920
Guys, we're losing a lot of men right now.

5068
03:13:51,340 --> 03:13:52,100
Don't worry.

5069
03:13:52,880 --> 03:13:54,020
It adds up.

5070
03:13:54,460 --> 03:13:56,020
It adds up, guys.

5071
03:13:56,500 --> 03:13:57,300
Don't worry.

5072
03:13:58,260 --> 03:13:59,440
I'm doing my part.

5073
03:13:59,900 --> 03:14:01,440
I'm doing my part.

5074
03:14:04,260 --> 03:14:05,300
Okay, let's see.

5075
03:14:05,360 --> 03:14:06,200
I know I have grenades.

5076
03:14:06,640 --> 03:14:07,520
I know I...

5077
03:14:08,160 --> 03:14:08,880
Okay, grenades.

5078
03:14:09,100 --> 03:14:10,200
Oh, I have a hunting rifle.

5079
03:14:10,440 --> 03:14:11,680
Wait, I have more than this.

5080
03:14:13,400 --> 03:14:16,900
Guys, instead of one damage, I'm doing four!

5081
03:14:18,440 --> 03:14:19,460
Okay, guys.

5082
03:14:19,600 --> 03:14:22,660
Honestly though, I think like... it does not matter.

5083
03:14:22,780 --> 03:14:28,400
I think at this point, due to like damage per second, this is like the most efficient.

5084
03:14:33,900 --> 03:14:38,140
If we look at damage per second, we might as well.

5085
03:14:40,560 --> 03:14:44,660
The hunting rifle takes just way too long.

5086
03:14:46,920 --> 03:14:47,600
True.

5087
03:14:48,300 --> 03:14:49,200
Oh, God.

5088
03:14:49,280 --> 03:14:49,880
Oh, God.

5089
03:14:49,900 --> 03:14:51,060
There's so many minions.

5090
03:14:51,460 --> 03:14:52,940
There's so many minions.

5091
03:14:53,000 --> 03:14:53,660
But don't worry.

5092
03:14:53,880 --> 03:14:54,800
I'm okay.

5093
03:14:54,980 --> 03:14:55,960
I'm okay.

5094
03:14:55,960 --> 03:14:56,180
I'm okay.

5095
03:14:56,180 --> 03:14:56,180
I'm okay.

5096
03:14:56,200 --> 03:14:56,580
I'm okay.

5097
03:14:58,000 --> 03:14:59,860
I think Doki is...

5098
03:14:59,860 --> 03:15:00,580
healing him.

5099
03:15:01,220 --> 03:15:03,660
There's no way I'm healing him.

5100
03:15:03,800 --> 03:15:06,120
I am contributing, guys.

5101
03:15:08,900 --> 03:15:12,480
I'm contributing as best as I could.

5102
03:15:13,020 --> 03:15:13,780
Okay.

5103
03:15:14,020 --> 03:15:19,140
I am doing my absolute damnedest right now.

5104
03:15:23,400 --> 03:15:24,920
I am doing my absolute damnedest right now.

5105
03:15:24,920 --> 03:15:25,440
Oh, my God!

5106
03:15:25,540 --> 03:15:25,880
Oh, my God!

5107
03:15:25,880 --> 03:15:26,180
Oh, my God!

5108
03:15:27,040 --> 03:15:31,800
Imagine like how much I'm gonna level up by the time this is over.

5109
03:15:32,080 --> 03:15:33,480
Guys just imagine.

5110
03:15:35,340 --> 03:15:38,320

03:15:38,500 --> 03:15:45,460
Okay guys I'm gonna see if I can equip like a- I have to have like a fucking grenade right?

5112
03:15:46,040 --> 03:15:47,180
Where's my grenade?

5113
03:15:47,560 --> 03:15:48,900
Oh I got sugar bombs.

5114
03:15:49,260 --> 03:15:50,440
Is that nades?

5115
03:15:50,640 --> 03:15:54,180
I like threw away all my nades to my backpacks.

5116
03:15:55,200 --> 03:15:56,760
What the fuck is going on?

5117
03:15:57,940 --> 03:15:58,620
What's this?

5118
03:15:58,720 --> 03:15:59,680
Oh no that's just heals.

5119
03:15:59,920 --> 03:16:05,760
Okay I threw away my- guys I accidentally like threw away my nades.

5120
03:16:08,240 --> 03:16:09,580
Look for nukas?

5121
03:16:09,640 --> 03:16:12,140
Okay okay I'm gonna try nukas.

5122
03:16:12,160 --> 03:16:15,060
Just make sure they don't get near me cause I'm looking for stuff right now.

5123
03:16:15,380 --> 03:16:19,360
And nuka, cola, rattlewit.

5124
03:16:19,660 --> 03:16:22,640
Oh I actually did throw away all of them!

5125
03:16:23,400 --> 03:16:23,920
Why?

5126
03:16:24,040 --> 03:16:24,160
I'm so sorry.

5127
03:16:24,180 --> 03:16:24,560
Accident!

5128
03:16:26,660 --> 03:16:28,020
It's okay I have food though.

5129
03:16:28,500 --> 03:16:29,700
I have food though.

5130
03:16:30,260 --> 03:16:31,780
Don't worry I'm helping.

5131
03:16:33,000 --> 03:16:34,040

5132
03:16:35,980 --> 03:16:36,780
Let's do it bye.

5133
03:16:37,480 --> 03:16:38,380
Oh shit!

5134
03:16:38,500 --> 03:16:40,900
You know what I actually like it in third person more.

5135
03:16:41,080 --> 03:16:43,460
I feel like third person you can see it better.

5136
03:16:43,720 --> 03:16:44,940
Wait we did it we did it!

5137
03:16:45,120 --> 03:16:46,300
We're gonna do it guys!

5138
03:16:47,400 --> 03:16:48,380
We did it!

5139
03:16:49,780 --> 03:16:50,440
Oh my!

5140
03:16:54,070 --> 03:16:54,510
Yoink.

5141
03:16:54,510 --> 03:16:56,810
Like, do we all get it together?

5142
03:16:57,430 --> 03:16:59,610
Do we each get our own set of items?

5143
03:16:59,730 --> 03:17:01,410
Or like, do we share it?

5144
03:17:02,510 --> 03:17:05,590
Do we all share it or do we each get our own set of items?

5145
03:17:08,110 --> 03:17:09,070
Only 510?!

5146
03:17:09,070 --> 03:17:10,650
Oh, we have to escape the mines!

5147
03:17:10,990 --> 03:17:11,690
Oh no!

5148
03:17:11,810 --> 03:17:12,470
Oh no!

5149
03:17:12,970 --> 03:17:15,210
Oh no, I'm still level 8!

5150
03:17:15,710 --> 03:17:17,130
Oh, loot is personal.

5151
03:17:17,190 --> 03:17:17,670
That's great.

5152
03:17:18,110 --> 03:17:18,850
Oh no!

5153
03:17:18,970 --> 03:17:19,590
Oh no!

5154
03:17:19,670 --> 03:17:20,290
Oh no!

5155
03:17:20,330 --> 03:17:21,110
We gotta escape!

5156
03:17:21,110 --> 03:17:24,270
Guys, I can't believe...

5157
03:17:24,270 --> 03:17:28,730
I can't believe I spent so long with my one damage.

5158
03:17:30,350 --> 03:17:35,390
And I just... I just get 800 damage.

5159
03:17:35,570 --> 03:17:38,190
Are you... are you fucking kidding me?

5160
03:17:38,710 --> 03:17:39,410
No!

5161
03:17:39,590 --> 03:17:40,970
Don't let them touch me!

5162
03:17:41,710 --> 03:17:44,110
Don't let... I got more damage...

5163
03:17:44,110 --> 03:17:46,710
I got more XP from the fucking Wendigos!

5164
03:17:47,070 --> 03:17:48,970
That is so messed up.

5165
03:17:51,110 --> 03:17:52,110
That is actually...

5166
03:17:52,110 --> 03:17:54,450
That is so fucking messed up.

5167
03:17:54,510 --> 03:17:55,870
I actually get more...

5168
03:17:55,870 --> 03:17:57,690
I was there.

5169
03:17:59,270 --> 03:18:03,710
I got more... I got 810 from fucking...

5170
03:18:03,710 --> 03:18:06,250
I got 1000 from killing a Wendigo.

5171
03:18:06,800 --> 03:18:08,090
Like, what the fuck?

5172
03:18:08,330 --> 03:18:10,110
Oh my god.

5173
03:18:13,840 --> 03:18:15,570
I can't believe it.

5174
03:18:15,790 --> 03:18:18,210
I got participated, guys.

5175
03:18:18,730 --> 03:18:19,610
Is this it?

5176
03:18:19,650 --> 03:18:20,890
Are we outside the mines now?

5177
03:18:21,110 --> 03:18:22,490
Are we good to go?

5178
03:18:22,910 --> 03:18:23,950
Oh shit.

5179
03:18:24,030 --> 03:18:24,390
Nice.

5180
03:18:25,590 --> 03:18:26,430
Oh my god.

5181
03:18:26,450 --> 03:18:26,930
Are we outside?

5182
03:18:27,170 --> 03:18:27,650
I can't tell.

5183
03:18:27,750 --> 03:18:28,170
Alright guys.

5184
03:18:28,290 --> 03:18:29,070
Good job everybody.

5185
03:18:30,570 --> 03:18:31,290
I know.

5186
03:18:35,930 --> 03:18:37,750
I did it everybody.

5187
03:18:42,490 --> 03:18:44,310
A real challenger!

5188
03:18:47,570 --> 03:18:48,650
Oh fuck!

5189
03:18:58,220 --> 03:18:58,960
Oh god.

5190
03:18:58,960 --> 03:19:00,000
Yes!

5191
03:19:00,220 --> 03:19:01,040
Oh, I just...

5192
03:19:01,040 --> 03:19:02,040
I just lived...

5193
03:19:02,040 --> 03:19:03,440
I just lived in time.

5194
03:19:10,340 --> 03:19:11,560
Oh my god.

5195
03:19:11,620 --> 03:19:11,860
I'm...

5196
03:19:11,860 --> 03:19:13,060
I'm alive.

5197
03:19:15,460 --> 03:19:16,740
Holy shit.

5198
03:19:17,200 --> 03:19:18,780
I'm fucking... I'm alive.

5199
03:19:19,640 --> 03:19:20,800
Oh my god.

5200
03:19:20,820 --> 03:19:21,360
I'm level 10!

5201
03:19:23,680 --> 03:19:24,840
Item reward!

5202
03:19:27,180 --> 03:19:27,820
Yay!

5203
03:19:27,820 --> 03:19:28,000
Yay!

5204
03:19:30,700 --> 03:19:31,220
Okay.

5205
03:19:31,620 --> 03:19:33,800
I think I ate too much of the rat away.

5206
03:19:33,960 --> 03:19:35,400
I was like freaking out.

5207
03:19:35,600 --> 03:19:37,320
I was...

5208
03:19:37,320 --> 03:19:38,380
I was...

5209
03:19:38,380 --> 03:19:40,480
I was fucking freaking out just then.

5210
03:19:41,240 --> 03:19:42,280
Holy shit.

5211
03:19:42,400 --> 03:19:43,000
Oh my god.

5212
03:19:43,020 --> 03:19:44,000
There's a jetpack?

5213
03:19:45,300 --> 03:19:47,460
Wait, there's jetpacks in this game?

5214
03:19:48,400 --> 03:19:49,440
Holy shit.

5215
03:19:49,540 --> 03:19:51,520
This game is like so complicated.

5216
03:19:51,660 --> 03:19:54,940
There's like fucking turrets and everything too.

5217
03:19:55,240 --> 03:19:56,600
What's this guy's house like?

5218
03:19:59,360 --> 03:20:00,480
What's his house like?

5219
03:20:00,640 --> 03:20:00,780
What's his house like?

5220
03:20:04,680 --> 03:20:06,500
Oh, he locked it.

5221
03:20:06,620 --> 03:20:08,680
I can't believe he doesn't want me in it.

5222
03:20:08,900 --> 03:20:09,920
I don't understand.

5223
03:20:10,500 --> 03:20:13,340
You don't want the Doki Bird tour on his crib?

5224
03:20:13,620 --> 03:20:14,940
We did it everybody!

5225
03:20:15,500 --> 03:20:17,300
I'm gonna steal your fucking flower.

5226
03:20:20,520 --> 03:20:21,440
Oh my god!

5227
03:20:22,700 --> 03:20:25,440
I got three star rolling pin?

5228
03:20:25,620 --> 03:20:26,260
What did I get?

5229
03:20:27,460 --> 03:20:28,160
Wait, alright.

5230
03:20:28,320 --> 03:20:28,620
New.

5231
03:20:28,720 --> 03:20:30,700
I got the healing slot.

5232
03:20:30,920 --> 03:20:32,220
Oh wait, I got...

5233
03:20:32,220 --> 03:20:33,380
Oh my god, guys!

5234
03:20:33,820 --> 03:20:34,340
Look!

5235
03:20:35,740 --> 03:20:37,500
I got a rolling pin now.

5236
03:20:38,140 --> 03:20:39,040
Look at that.

5237
03:20:43,240 --> 03:20:45,160
Oh my god, wait what's this knuckles?

5238
03:20:45,500 --> 03:20:47,420
Oh, that's so fucking...

5239
03:20:48,820 --> 03:20:50,040
What hit me?

5240
03:20:50,160 --> 03:20:52,500
Oh, I thought I actually got hit.

5241
03:20:52,620 --> 03:20:55,380
I was like, did I accidentally turn PVP on?

5242
03:20:55,600 --> 03:20:56,880
What happened?

5243
03:20:57,680 --> 03:20:58,700
Okay, what else did I get?

5244
03:20:58,700 --> 03:21:00,480
Oh my god, look.

5245
03:21:00,780 --> 03:21:01,760
Look, I got...

5246
03:21:01,760 --> 03:21:03,160
I got a rolling pin.

5247
03:21:03,380 --> 03:21:04,080
Look at that.

5248
03:21:04,300 --> 03:21:06,500
You get bounty if you pick somebody's lock.

5249
03:21:06,780 --> 03:21:08,860
Alright guys, let's break into this man's house.

5250
03:21:09,500 --> 03:21:11,060
Guys, this is my final...

5251
03:21:11,700 --> 03:21:11,960
Guys.

5252
03:21:12,460 --> 03:21:12,980
Guys.

5253
03:21:13,060 --> 03:21:14,740
Somebody break into this man's house.

5254
03:21:20,200 --> 03:21:23,300
I request somebody break into this.

5255
03:21:28,700 --> 03:21:31,220
Come on guys, it'll be so funny.

5256
03:21:31,880 --> 03:21:33,260
No way!

5257
03:21:38,580 --> 03:21:40,020
Hey guys...

5258
03:21:40,660 --> 03:21:41,700
What the fuck?

5259
03:21:41,960 --> 03:21:42,680
Wanted?

5260
03:21:42,700 --> 03:21:44,460
Oh, it's his house!

5261
03:21:45,740 --> 03:21:49,020
Wait, wait, wait, oh no, he broke in!

5262
03:21:49,340 --> 03:21:49,940
Guys!

5263
03:21:50,320 --> 03:21:52,220
We got a wanted criminal!

5264
03:21:55,020 --> 03:21:59,500
I was like... oh my god, wait, is this like an interrogation?

5265
03:21:59,880 --> 03:22:03,340
Oh my god... he is wanted...

5266
03:22:03,340 --> 03:22:03,580
Guys!

5267
03:22:03,980 --> 03:22:07,440
It's five... it's five bottle caps!

5268
03:22:07,520 --> 03:22:09,400
We can actually... oh, we can.

5269
03:22:13,970 --> 03:22:16,480
Oh my god, the five bottle caps!

5270
03:22:16,700 --> 03:22:17,980
Holy shit!

5271
03:22:22,940 --> 03:22:25,900
Man, guys, for five bottle caps!

5272
03:22:26,160 --> 03:22:26,980
Holy shit!

5273
03:22:27,140 --> 03:22:28,840
What makes you special?

5274
03:22:29,200 --> 03:22:31,860
Must be... oh, it's like a level 25.

5275
03:22:32,600 --> 03:22:34,520
Oh my god, it's like a workbench!

5276
03:22:35,180 --> 03:22:37,640
For five bottle caps, man!

5277
03:22:37,760 --> 03:22:38,100
That...

5278
03:22:39,880 --> 03:22:44,520
Just cause we broke into this man's house, that's actually like crazy.

5279
03:22:45,060 --> 03:22:46,920
The betrayal...

5280
03:22:46,920 --> 03:22:49,940
Wasted for five bottle caps.

5281
03:22:50,240 --> 03:22:51,340
Holy shit!

5282
03:22:52,220 --> 03:22:53,880
Five caps well earned!

5283
03:22:55,060 --> 03:22:55,420
Nice!

5284
03:22:55,720 --> 03:22:56,580
Good job, guys!

5285
03:22:58,440 --> 03:22:59,900
Good job, everybody!

5286
03:23:00,880 --> 03:23:02,740
We fucking did it!

5287
03:23:05,340 --> 03:23:08,440
Five bottle caps is five bottle caps!

5288
03:23:08,820 --> 03:23:10,300
I love multiplayer.

5289
03:23:10,520 --> 03:23:13,720
This is also why I joined... why I wanted to play multiplayer.

5290
03:23:14,180 --> 03:23:15,500
Because like...

5291
03:23:16,220 --> 03:23:20,620
Like you... when you play Fallout... when you play like single player games...

5292
03:23:20,620 --> 03:23:22,220
You sort of know where it's headed.

5293
03:23:22,520 --> 03:23:24,620
But when you play multiplayer games...

5294
03:23:25,180 --> 03:23:27,140
You... every... it's an adventure.

5295
03:23:27,580 --> 03:23:28,980
It's a new experience.

5296
03:23:31,660 --> 03:23:32,480
Alright, everybody!

5297
03:23:32,720 --> 03:23:33,880
Back to my place!

5298
03:23:34,820 --> 03:23:36,340
Back to my place, everybody!

5299
03:23:37,800 --> 03:23:39,520
I need to remember where my house is.

5300
03:23:39,800 --> 03:23:40,920
Where's my house?

5301
03:23:41,440 --> 03:23:42,440
Oh, it's right here.

5302
03:23:42,800 --> 03:23:43,740
Real female.

5303
03:23:44,460 --> 03:23:45,020
Alright.

5304
03:23:45,840 --> 03:23:46,600
Here we go.

5305
03:23:47,540 --> 03:23:49,900
That dragoon dying by herself.

5306
03:23:50,640 --> 03:23:52,720
What can you even get for...

5307
03:23:52,720 --> 03:23:53,920
Fast travel!

5308
03:23:54,140 --> 03:23:54,820
That's what!

5309
03:23:55,180 --> 03:23:56,140
What do you mean?

5310
03:23:56,320 --> 03:23:57,780
I should start charging people.

5311
03:23:58,100 --> 03:23:59,740
Guys, don't come to my house yet.

5312
03:23:59,780 --> 03:24:01,140
I'm gonna start charging people to...

5313
03:24:01,140 --> 03:24:02,360
To come to my house.

5314
03:24:03,100 --> 03:24:04,900
Just like all the other fast travelers.

5315
03:24:05,360 --> 03:24:06,560
I'm gonna charge it.

5316
03:24:07,960 --> 03:24:08,460
Um...

5317
03:24:08,460 --> 03:24:09,840
Change icon.

5318
03:24:10,400 --> 03:24:11,080
There you go.

5319
03:24:11,100 --> 03:24:12,060
That's when you know it's me.

5320
03:24:14,240 --> 03:24:15,200
Wait, no.

5321
03:24:15,340 --> 03:24:17,020
Because I'm the law.

5322
03:24:17,480 --> 03:24:17,980
Hahaha!

5323
03:24:20,620 --> 03:24:21,000
Hahaha!

5324
03:24:22,580 --> 03:24:23,220
Hahaha!

5325
03:24:23,540 --> 03:24:24,180
Alright.

5326
03:24:25,160 --> 03:24:26,620
Where the fuck's my house?

5327
03:24:26,860 --> 03:24:27,300
Is it here?

5328
03:24:28,900 --> 03:24:29,980
Oh, it's right here.

5329
03:24:30,320 --> 03:24:30,960
Alright.

5330
03:24:31,160 --> 03:24:31,880
Hey, everybody.

5331
03:24:32,080 --> 03:24:33,420
This is my house.

5332
03:24:33,800 --> 03:24:35,240
Wait, what's in my...

5333
03:24:35,240 --> 03:24:35,740
Ooh!

5334
03:24:37,880 --> 03:24:38,660
What's this?

5335
03:24:39,120 --> 03:24:39,760
Plan...

5336
03:24:39,760 --> 03:24:41,080
Plan, plan, plan, plan.

5337
03:24:41,300 --> 03:24:41,540
Ooh!

5338
03:24:42,540 --> 03:24:43,680
Oh my god!

5339
03:24:45,400 --> 03:24:46,540
Soul survivor?

5340
03:24:47,400 --> 03:24:50,340
Look at all these recipes that I earned!

5341
03:24:50,620 --> 03:24:51,440
Oh my god, guys!

5342
03:24:51,620 --> 03:24:53,680
Guys, our house is gonna be so much better now!

5343
03:24:54,360 --> 03:24:55,060
Guys, okay.

5344
03:24:55,220 --> 03:24:56,060
I got some...

5345
03:24:56,060 --> 03:24:57,300
I found some new plans.

5346
03:24:58,340 --> 03:24:59,720
Guys, I found...

5347
03:25:01,080 --> 03:25:03,140
Guys, I found some new stuff, guys!

5348
03:25:03,680 --> 03:25:04,900
Okay, how do I...

5349
03:25:05,440 --> 03:25:05,860
Alright.

5350
03:25:07,700 --> 03:25:08,980
How do I make them?

5351
03:25:09,720 --> 03:25:11,280
Oh, I did not unlock it yet?

5352
03:25:11,620 --> 03:25:14,120
Okay, we're gonna unlock a...

5353
03:25:14,120 --> 03:25:16,100
We're gonna put this on here, though.

5354
03:25:16,440 --> 03:25:16,860
Yay!

5355
03:25:17,540 --> 03:25:18,240
Alright, guys.

5356
03:25:21,120 --> 03:25:22,040
Guys, everybody.

5357
03:25:22,740 --> 03:25:24,280
Guys, in front of me, guys!

5358
03:25:24,360 --> 03:25:25,600
This is the leader platform!

5359
03:25:26,460 --> 03:25:27,980
Everybody, in front of me!

5360
03:25:28,120 --> 03:25:28,520
Everybody!

5361
03:25:29,500 --> 03:25:30,400
Stand in front!

5362
03:25:31,520 --> 03:25:34,620
Your leader requests you to stand in front of me!

5363
03:25:35,420 --> 03:25:36,400
Fancy, I know.

5364
03:25:37,860 --> 03:25:38,700
Alright, everybody.

5365
03:25:41,200 --> 03:25:46,400
As you all know, before I begin my speech, give me the dragon...

5366
03:25:47,240 --> 03:25:47,960
Give me...

5367
03:25:47,960 --> 03:25:48,120
Sorry.

5368
03:25:48,140 --> 03:25:48,220
I'm gonna...

5369
03:25:48,220 --> 03:25:49,520
Give me the Doki...

5370
03:25:49,520 --> 03:25:51,420
The Doki emote right here.

5371
03:25:51,800 --> 03:25:53,080
Sorry, they both start with Ds.

5372
03:25:56,980 --> 03:25:57,660
Dragoons!

5373
03:25:58,260 --> 03:25:59,540
Give me the...

5374
03:25:59,540 --> 03:26:01,620
Give me the Doki emote!

5375
03:26:02,180 --> 03:26:03,060
That's right!

5376
03:26:03,500 --> 03:26:05,380
The Doki emote!

5377
03:26:05,760 --> 03:26:06,440
Nice.

5378
03:26:06,540 --> 03:26:07,800
Alright, everybody.

5379
03:26:08,660 --> 03:26:10,020
Alright, dragoons.

5380
03:26:10,860 --> 03:26:11,540
Dragoons.

5381
03:26:12,000 --> 03:26:15,180
I like to say, thank you for the wonderful experience.

5382
03:26:15,900 --> 03:26:16,580
Ah...

5383
03:26:19,300 --> 03:26:23,560
Thank you for the wonderful experience at Fallout 76.

5384
03:26:24,160 --> 03:26:25,960
I had a great time.

5385
03:26:26,340 --> 03:26:27,420
I don't think I...

5386
03:26:27,420 --> 03:26:30,280
Like, we did much of the actual lore of this game.

5387
03:26:34,540 --> 03:26:37,800
I don't think we did much of the lore of this game.

5388
03:26:38,040 --> 03:26:42,680
But I still had a great time that I'm honestly inspired to one day play.

5389
03:26:42,900 --> 03:26:45,860
Either New Vegas or Fallout 4 in the future.

5390
03:26:46,460 --> 03:26:48,200
Because it has been a really fun...

5391
03:26:48,200 --> 03:26:49,080
A really fun time, everybody.

5392
03:26:50,240 --> 03:26:50,920
Anyway...

5393
03:26:50,920 --> 03:26:52,900
To end it off...

5394
03:26:52,900 --> 03:26:56,960
I request all of you to turn off PvP right now.

5395
03:26:57,180 --> 03:27:00,240
And the final person to live gets to kill me.

5396
03:27:00,860 --> 03:27:01,540
Alright?

5397
03:27:01,900 --> 03:27:03,280
When I count the...

5398
03:27:06,660 --> 03:27:07,340
Okay.

5399
03:27:10,980 --> 03:27:12,000
In three...

5400
03:27:13,580 --> 03:27:14,260
Two...

5401
03:27:14,260 --> 03:27:15,040
One...

5402
03:27:15,040 --> 03:27:16,540
I don't know what's going on.

5403
03:27:26,140 --> 03:27:27,720
Oh, my God.

5404
03:27:27,820 --> 03:27:28,000
Oh, my God.

5405
03:27:28,000 --> 03:27:28,940
Oh, you're the losing older.

5406
03:27:32,580 --> 03:27:34,580
Holy shit!

5407
03:27:34,600 --> 03:27:35,340
Holy shit!

5408
03:27:35,340 --> 03:27:36,500
Oh, my God!

5409
03:27:40,400 --> 03:27:42,840
Oh, my God!

5410
03:27:43,400 --> 03:27:44,700
Holy shit.

5411
03:27:45,200 --> 03:27:48,300
There's so many people dying!

5412
03:27:48,780 --> 03:27:49,420
Dude.

5413
03:27:49,640 --> 03:27:51,400
Oh my god!

5414
03:27:52,680 --> 03:27:53,320
It's

5415
03:28:00,640 --> 03:28:01,420
changing!

5416
03:28:09,120 --> 03:28:10,620
This is so interesting.

5417
03:28:10,980 --> 03:28:12,640
Who's still alive?

5418
03:28:14,040 --> 03:28:18,400
Who's still... I can't see anything!

5419
03:28:19,180 --> 03:28:20,580
Oh my god!

5420
03:28:21,740 --> 03:28:23,680
Fuck, I'm just gonna go through this.

5421
03:28:23,680 --> 03:28:24,220
Can I have to hold?

5422
03:28:24,300 --> 03:28:25,680
This is my new home now.

5423
03:28:26,240 --> 03:28:27,240
Oh my god.

5424
03:28:28,200 --> 03:28:30,200
Oh my god, who's still alive?

5425
03:28:31,480 --> 03:28:32,660
Who's still alive?

5426
03:28:35,720 --> 03:28:37,120
Oh my god.

5427
03:28:38,360 --> 03:28:38,960
Alright.

5428
03:28:39,880 --> 03:28:42,840
Guys, I think this is gonna take forever, guys.

5429
03:28:43,240 --> 03:28:45,560
So how do I turn off PVP?

5430
03:28:48,600 --> 03:28:50,460
Oh my god!

5431
03:28:51,200 --> 03:28:52,880
Holy shit!

5432
03:28:54,040 --> 03:28:56,140
How do I turn off PVP?

5433
03:28:57,940 --> 03:28:59,840
I started another war!

5434
03:29:00,200 --> 03:29:03,460
My PC would have... Oh my god!

5435
03:29:07,560 --> 03:29:13,940
Oh my god!

5436
03:29:15,160 --> 03:29:16,400
He's like, ahhh!

5437
03:29:16,700 --> 03:29:17,560
Oh god.

5438
03:29:20,960 --> 03:29:22,480
Oh, I can't to level 20?

5439
03:29:23,080 --> 03:29:24,200
Hey guys.

5440
03:29:24,600 --> 03:29:25,360
JK.

5441
03:29:25,860 --> 03:29:28,220
Wait, settings, game... Oh, I can!

5442
03:29:28,420 --> 03:29:29,160
Okay, settings.

5443
03:29:29,160 --> 03:29:33,120
Alright, while you guys kill each other, let me figure out how to turn on...

5444
03:29:33,940 --> 03:29:34,460
Settings...

5445
03:29:36,180 --> 03:29:36,700
Settings...

5446
03:29:37,720 --> 03:29:38,240
Game...

5447
03:29:39,140 --> 03:29:39,660
Off.

5448
03:29:39,960 --> 03:29:40,700
Alright guys.

5449
03:29:41,940 --> 03:29:42,680
It's off.

5450
03:29:45,300 --> 03:29:46,140
14 damage.

5451
03:29:49,100 --> 03:29:50,140
I'm still okay.

5452
03:29:50,400 --> 03:29:50,980
Wait, what?

5453
03:29:51,280 --> 03:29:54,120
Wait, I can shoot people, but people can't shoot me?

5454
03:29:54,660 --> 03:29:55,560
Oh my god!

5455
03:29:55,620 --> 03:29:56,580
I fucking inv...

5456
03:29:56,580 --> 03:29:57,640
I

5457
03:30:01,690 --> 03:30:02,670
fucking knew it!

5458
03:30:02,750 --> 03:30:05,550
I knew I was invincible, guys.

5459
03:30:06,010 --> 03:30:07,910
I fucking knew it.

5460
03:30:09,390 --> 03:30:12,030
I knew nothing can kill me.

5461
03:30:14,150 --> 03:30:16,870
I knew the radiation works, guys!

5462
03:30:17,450 --> 03:30:18,630
The radiation!

5463
03:30:21,940 --> 03:30:24,660
Is it because I'm next to my house?

5464
03:30:24,860 --> 03:30:26,100
That must be it.

5465
03:30:27,980 --> 03:30:29,100
No, I'm not!

5466
03:30:29,240 --> 03:30:29,500
See?

5467
03:30:29,500 --> 03:30:32,280
I can live forever!

5468
03:30:33,220 --> 03:30:34,600
I knew it.

5469
03:30:34,620 --> 03:30:35,500
Nothing can...

5470
03:30:35,500 --> 03:30:38,100
Nothing can stop me now.

5471
03:30:39,020 --> 03:30:41,460
Nothing can stop me now.

5472
03:30:42,320 --> 03:30:44,560
I knew I could live forever.

5473
03:30:44,700 --> 03:30:45,960
JK, guys.

5474
03:30:47,500 --> 03:30:48,860
See, look at that.

5475
03:30:49,200 --> 03:30:50,340
Look at that.

5476
03:30:52,140 --> 03:30:54,100
I told you guys.

5477
03:30:54,420 --> 03:30:54,860
I'm...

5478
03:30:57,460 --> 03:30:59,360
I can live forever.

5479
03:30:59,360 --> 03:31:01,880
It was the rats.

5480
03:31:02,100 --> 03:31:06,740
I knew standing in the middle of the radiation zone would help me.

5481
03:31:08,320 --> 03:31:09,300
Look at that.

5482
03:31:09,500 --> 03:31:10,160
Anyway, guys.

5483
03:31:10,660 --> 03:31:11,500
GG's, everybody.

5484
03:31:11,760 --> 03:31:14,500
We have another stream in an hour.

5485
03:31:14,540 --> 03:31:16,000
A member stream in an hour.

5486
03:31:16,180 --> 03:31:17,780
So I am going to...

5487
03:31:17,780 --> 03:31:18,780
Wait, double check.

5488
03:31:19,000 --> 03:31:19,540
I'll double check.

5489
03:31:19,800 --> 03:31:20,600
Don't worry.

5490
03:31:21,100 --> 03:31:22,540
You guys can keep trying.

5491
03:31:22,740 --> 03:31:23,460
I'll double check.

5492
03:31:24,460 --> 03:31:25,200
Yeah, see?

5493
03:31:26,200 --> 03:31:26,800
Hahaha!

5494
03:31:26,800 --> 03:31:27,080
Hahaha!

5495
03:31:28,420 --> 03:31:29,100
Hahaha!

5496
03:31:29,380 --> 03:31:30,300
Yeah, see?

5497
03:31:33,680 --> 03:31:34,620
Yeah, see?

5498
03:31:34,820 --> 03:31:35,320
I'm fine.

5499
03:31:35,540 --> 03:31:36,720
I can shoot other people.

5500
03:31:42,420 --> 03:31:43,100
Yay!

5501
03:31:50,380 --> 03:31:53,880
People are dying around me, but I'm okay.

5502
03:31:54,820 --> 03:31:57,860
Just like Todd Howard intended, guys.

5503
03:31:57,860 --> 03:32:00,480
Just like Todd Howard wanted.

5504
03:32:00,760 --> 03:32:02,800
Wait, what's he doing here?

5505
03:32:04,360 --> 03:32:05,580
Why is he...

5506
03:32:05,580 --> 03:32:06,640
Why is this guy...

5507
03:32:06,640 --> 03:32:08,200
Who is he?

5508
03:32:08,560 --> 03:32:09,160
Hahaha!

5509
03:32:11,720 --> 03:32:13,160
But can he kill me?

5510
03:32:13,260 --> 03:32:14,200
Is he the chosen one?

5511
03:32:14,520 --> 03:32:15,280
Are you the...

5512
03:32:15,280 --> 03:32:16,480
Oh, he's the chosen one!

5513
03:32:16,900 --> 03:32:18,300
He's the chosen one!

5514
03:32:18,360 --> 03:32:19,760
Kill him before he kills me!

5515
03:32:53,830 --> 03:32:54,530
He's the farmer.

5516
03:32:54,790 --> 03:32:56,590
Anyway, GG's, everybody.

5517
03:32:56,850 --> 03:32:58,010
As always, everyone.

5518
03:32:58,610 --> 03:32:59,770
Stay hydrated.

5519
03:33:00,430 --> 03:33:01,550
Pause to check.

5520
03:33:01,610 --> 03:33:01,850
Bye!

5521
03:33:01,850 --> 03:33:04,710
Get up and move around and get that blood flowing.

5522
03:33:05,050 --> 03:33:07,490
And you can stay up for me and your member.

5523
03:33:07,730 --> 03:33:10,490
Maybe stay up for another hour to watch one of the...

5524
03:33:10,490 --> 03:33:13,450
One of the best superhero movies of all time.

5525
03:33:13,970 --> 03:33:15,770
The Flash in 2020.

5526
03:33:16,230 --> 03:33:17,970
The Flash from 2023.

5527
03:33:19,890 --> 03:33:20,790
Alright, guys.

5528
03:33:21,030 --> 03:33:22,430
I'll see you guys soon, everybody.

5529
03:33:22,750 --> 03:33:23,370
Bye, guys!

5530
03:33:24,010 --> 03:33:24,570
Bye!
