1
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,710
Oh, hello, everyone.

2
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:48,890
Hello, hello.

3
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,730
I'm so sorry, guys.

4
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,350
Oh, I always hate starting late.

5
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:57,510
It was so, it was also like out of my, like, what's the
word?

6
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:04,230
It was like out of my, um, like, hands, too, because it was
like, I don't know what the fuck happened.

7
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:10,970
So, basically, uh, I left my PC on overnight, but I have
been leaving it on overnight the last, uh, out of my

8
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:11,210
control.

9
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:11,990
Yeah, out of my control.

10
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,350
Um, so I think I left it over.

11
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:21,650
overnight like three times this week which is apparently not
that good and I left it over time like overnight for like

12
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:29,350
one day or something yes we're close to 900k oh I do have
something planned for 900k I don't know if I can get it out

13
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:39,050
right away but um I'm super excited because uh I do have
like something that I've been planning for a bit for 900k

14
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:44,730
subscribers and it's like a good it's a good Christmas
present too you know it's like hitting 900k would be a nice

15
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,330
present to myself.

16
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,090
It's a gift to myself.

17
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:52,870
Or I guess it's like, you know, as we all work together,
it's our, it's our gift to ourselves.

18
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,010
It's a nice celebration.

19
00:02:54,830 --> 00:03:02,910
Um, so basically, uh, um, I set everything up, you know,
because obviously, um, Scooby-Doo Night of a Hundred Frights

20
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:06,710
isn't a, they never remastered Scooby-Doo Night of a Hundred
Frights.

21
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:12,410
So, um, people would be like, how did she get, how did she,
uh, get, um, get it to work?

22
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:24,570
Like, like, how, how was she able to play this game does she
have a playstation 2 right now did she so so i um set

23
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:34,130
everything up to beforehand but then i was like i did leave
it overnight i should restart my pc just in case um um

24
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:43,730
anyway so i restarted my pc and then nothing was turning on
like my pc was on Um, but my monitors wasn't on, uh, my

25
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:49,030
stream deck wasn't on, my keyboard wasn't on, so I got
really confused, because I know it wasn't a monitor issue,

26
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:55,710
because my stream deck and my keyboard weren't turning on it
as well, because they weren't, like, receiving any signal.

27
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:03,610
Um, and, uh, and then so I was just like, what the fuck is,
what, what the fuck is happening?

28
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:11,590
So then I, um, so then I, so I rebooted it again, And I was
like, you know, an SOS emergency call with like the PC

29
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,330
people too.

30
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:12,950
And I was like, what the?

31
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:14,750
I'm like, help.

32
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:18,630
I, please, I need, I need this for work.

33
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:19,810
Please help me.

34
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:23,810
Yeah, I hope it's never a RAM issue with what's going on
right now in the world.

35
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:29,770
Like I'm not paying a thousand dollars for RAM.

36
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:33,030
Thank God I bought RAM before this happened.

37
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:44,590
Anyway, so I got really worried because I was like, what if
my GP you fried or something because like you know um i have

38
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:47,990
a 50 80 i think it's either 50 80 or 50 90.

39
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:58,190
i have lost track like honestly i've lost track there's so
many numbers i don't fucking remember anymore um and so i

40
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:04,190
was freaking out because i literally got it like a couple of
months ago so thankfully my gpo didn't fry then i'm like

41
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:09,310
wondering oh no is it a motherboard because i always have
motherboard issues for some fucking reason i don't know why

42
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:17,630
i think i remember frying my motherboard last time so i'm
like um oh what if my motherboard fried um so i was

43
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:27,970
panicking and then after 10 minutes of panicking my pc just
turns on it fixed itself i guess so um so i was looking at

44
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:34,090
the motherboard and apparently so there's a light on the
motherboard um and the person on call was like, what does

45
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:34,870
the light say?

46
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,390
And I was like, it's orange.

47
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,270
And they're like, oh, that's not good.

48
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:40,590
And I'm like, why?

49
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,850
I was like, what do you mean it's not good?

50
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:53,250
Because they're like, oh, if the motherboard is showing an
orange light, it means that it might be an issue with either

51
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,670
RAM, CPU, or GPU.

52
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,430
Like orange is bad.

53
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,510
And I'm like, that's no good.

54
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:09,090
And then I was like, And while the guy was explaining me why
orange is not good, I was like, it's green now.

55
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,610
And then my PC turned on.

56
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:13,690
I was like, all right, fix it.

57
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:18,410
I was like, I was like, all right, it's all fixed now.

58
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:23,450
Yay.

59
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,150
I don't know how.

60
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:32,890
I don't know what happened, but it turned green light and
it's so over.

61
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:42,110
we're so back it's so over we're so freaking back uh i have
no use for you anymore um so it took like i think like 10 12

62
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:49,890
minutes for it to boot up i think and then like they said
that oh it's because you left it overnight too many times so

63
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:56,810
like they need like time to i don't know dump out i don't
fucking know i don't know pc stuff i actually was so tempted

64
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:03,750
to do a pc builder stream um this week Like with the PC
building simulator, but I know I'm gonna rage bait so many

65
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:08,550
people, but it wouldn't be intentional, intentionally
because I have no idea what I'm doing.

66
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:15,740
Like, I just be like, is this where I put the RAM?

67
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:22,300
I'll be like, is this the CPU while I hold up the fucking
motherboard or some shit?

68
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,380
Yeah, the PC said, not today, Satan, not today.

69
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:41,040
anyway um anyway so that's basically what happened it just
fixed itself i was panicking for um i believe 30 minutes and

70
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:46,740
then it fixed itself i have no idea what the fuck happened i
just assumed that i just left it on overnight way too many

71
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:52,200
times last week i usually don't do that i've just been like
very tired lately the last couple last week because i would

72
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:58,420
be like i'm just gonna take a little nap nap and then i'll
come back and do work stuff and it never becomes a little

73
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:07,100
nappy nap and then I wake up and it's morning and I'm like
oh and I'm like oh well guess plants didn't work out and I

74
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:14,260
was true do it again I'll try again like three more times I
was like maybe this time it will work you know maybe this

75
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:25,640
time I can will my body to wake up and then every time for
some reason it wasn't working that's why he said it alive

76
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:32,920
well I thought with my sheer willpower I would wake up like
after a couple of hours, but apparently my body was like,

77
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:33,380
no.

78
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,660
It's like, what do you mean, Willpye?

79
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,880
You have none, girl.

80
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,920
Yeah, I never learned.

81
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:44,680
I keep trying.

82
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,920
I was like, if I keep doing it, if I keep gambling, maybe
this time I'll hit it big, guys.

83
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,600
Jakarta, thank you for the super chat.

84
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:53,920
Thank you.

85
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,640
Thank you.

86
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,700
Nah, I wouldn't she never.

87
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,380
She never wins, guys.

88
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,820
Roll-roll, Ragi, Dokey's PC decided to act up, even though
she was on time.

89
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,580
But thankfully, Dokey was able to solve the computer
mystery.

90
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,600
Now let's see who the culprit really is.

91
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,480
Old man Windows.

92
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,940
Thank you, with the Super Chat.

93
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,160
Thank you, thank you.

94
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,560
No, because I think it was Super Chat.

95
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,200
Thank you, thank you.

96
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,800
I restarted my PC like three times a year.

97
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,120
Don't feel obliged to restart if nothing is wrong.

98
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,060
Thank you, the Super Chat.

99
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:21,880
Thank you, thank you.

100
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,440
I restarted it because, like, it's just like my parents
instilled this fear in me.

101
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:33,440
where like they're like don't leave it on overnight too many
times and then i guess like i got too comfortable because i

102
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:41,160
did and now it reinforced the fear like because if you like
if you leave it on too many times it will break and then

103
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:52,940
that and then i guess i got way too comfortable i was like
what if they were lying like after years of after years of

104
00:09:52,940 --> 00:10:03,320
that fear i was like i got way too and then it came back the
fear is back the one thing they didn't lie there was a lot

105
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:09,720
you know it's like they'll be like eat more fish it makes
you smarter i think that was a lie you know like those like

106
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:17,140
um those like wives tales that they tell you that they're
like if you do this it'll be like to like trick children

107
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:23,440
into thinking like um and thinking certain things so they'll
be like eat more fish it'll make you smarter i don't think

108
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,040
that worked

109
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:35,580
and um and then other things were uh oh they would tell me
like don't eat sashimi it's really it's raw fish it's not

110
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:45,620
good for you but it's just because they didn't want to buy
me sashimi because it's too expensive so i think that's like

111
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:50,580
i know it's like some asian parents do that to kids because
there was a youtube short about it and i was like my parents

112
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,980
did that too

113
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:07,990
like no sashimi is bad for you it's not good for kids um
it's raw fish and so i'll be like okay i'll get a california

114
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:19,050
road then i mean i do that too we all had the same parents i
don't remember what other lies they told me growing up just

115
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:27,510
so like um just so like you know they try to teach you like
um try it so they don't have to like tell you the reason why

116
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:34,050
they don't want to do something uh but i forgot some of the
lies they used to tell uh you know because it's parenting

117
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:45,030
like you have to make shit up it's it's parenting you have
to make shit up for the children to believe you uh my

118
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:55,870
parents never um i never believed santa was real even when i
was little because my parents never encouraged the whole

119
00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:07,090
aspect of santa claus So, so, you know, whenever Christmas
comes a lot, they'll just be like, all right, like whenever

120
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:11,170
Christmas is getting closer, they'll be like, all right,
what do you want?

121
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:18,230
So, you know, Santa, that's how I realized, wait, Santa
isn't real.

122
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:23,030
It's my parents buy me Christmas gifts, because they'll just
be like, what do you want?

123
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,670
Or be like, here's some money.

124
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:37,390
five and they're gonna fuck you what for christmas so like
that's why there was no whimsy there and and also the fact

125
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:44,750
that we didn't have a chimney so i was like how the fuck is
santa coming down and give me christmas presents so you know

126
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:53,590
my christmas tree would be like the presents that i knew my
parents got me because they'll just be like all right um

127
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:56,610
here's the gift we bought you It wasn't even wrapped, too.

128
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,510
That's the part.

129
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:06,130
There's added no presents there because I already have the,
they already gave me the presents unwrapped because they'll

130
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:09,070
just be like, here, I'm just like, here you go.

131
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,170
Or like, there was no presents down there.

132
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:18,230
So I knew Santa wasn't real because I was like, oh, Santa
chose, I was like, Santa only didn't come to my house.

133
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:24,470
Like, so, you know, my parents didn't want to be like, yeah,
Santa, you were a very bad kid.

134
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,170
So Santa skipped your house.

135
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:27,190
They didn't say that.

136
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:29,630
They just straight up be like, we got you the presents.

137
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:33,270
we had a tree though.

138
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:35,310
We had a Christmas tree.

139
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:41,650
So we just, I just, they just didn't encourage that, me that
Santa was real or anything.

140
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:46,590
Oh, and also that's how I found out the tooth theory was a
lie too.

141
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:55,070
Cause like, you know, whenever you lose a tooth, you lose a
tooth, you put the tooth underneath the, yeah i don't even

142
00:13:55,070 --> 00:14:02,430
get coal so i was just like clearly santa's fucking bullshit
like like they just skipped my house my house was just

143
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:11,790
wasn't on the map apparently um and so you know the teachers
would be like oh um you put a tooth under the pillow um

144
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:20,530
you'll get money so then obviously you know i didn't tell my
parents about it so then i i put uh i put my tooth under the

145
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:29,750
pillow and then the tooth fairy never came and then i was
like oh maybe i just need to put more teeth more teeth like

146
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:34,790
under the pillow and i told my parents about it i was like
why didn't the tooth fairy give me money that's what my

147
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,490
teachers told me and then they're like oh

148
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:50,050
they're just like oh do you want money we can we can give
you the money

149
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:56,030
They just, I don't know, I don't remember how much money
they gave me.

150
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:57,470
They're just like, here's money.

151
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:03,890
So that was like, oh, the dude, I was like, I knew it.

152
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:05,790
Dude, baby wasn't real either.

153
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:10,730
No, it's just, just business.

154
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:15,230
Yeah.

155
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:20,530
The teacher thought your family understood the assignment.

156
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:24,450
when I realized the two fairies wasn't real adding.

157
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:28,510
The fairies were like, here's the money for your teeth.

158
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,370
Osteen, thank you for the super chat.

159
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,630
Thank you, thank you.

160
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:40,010
The biggest lie my dad ever told me was that he was so hot.

161
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:43,730
Thank you for the super chat, Osteen, thank you, thank you.

162
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:45,790
Oh, you think you was super chat, thank you, thank you.

163
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:47,350
I didn't tell me if I swallowed gum.

164
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,550
It will be in my intestines for seven years in middle
school.

165
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,870
I knew she was lying because I swallowed every piece of gum.

166
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:54,950
I've ever had since I was born they give a super chat.

167
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:55,310
Thank you.

168
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:55,870
Thank you.

169
00:15:56,170 --> 00:16:05,350
Oh my god And then they lied to me and told me the
convenience store guy was Jackie Chan So so so there was

170
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:12,070
okay, so we had a convenience store near us and I always go
there for ice cream And they'll be like that's Jackie Chan.

171
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:21,090
I'm like, oh my god, Jackie So I would always go over and be
like hello Jackie I don't remember that because I'll take

172
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:29,730
pictures of it like oh my god Jackie Chan is like near me
and that's so I know that I don't know why the fuck they did

173
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:38,090
that and then um and then like and then like I would like
hang out in the convenience store because in my head I was

174
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:45,870
like I'm hanging out with Jackie Chan and but he was of
course he wasn't Jackie Chad why the fuck would he be here

175
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:56,590
he's a fucking movie star but I didn't know that I was like
five so but he would he would encourage it too he's like

176
00:16:56,590 --> 00:17:05,250
that I'm Jackie Chad like he would also be in on it so like
for like the like two to three years my life was a lie

177
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:12,330
because I thought Jackie Chad lived five minutes away from
me um do you know for sure no because then I remembered

178
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:20,150
because then And then I went back to the convenience store
when I was like older like when I was 10 or some shit No, I

179
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:26,530
think like oh, yeah, no, I came back Came back to Canada
like to be like visit some people and I was like I think I

180
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:32,670
was like 12 or 13 And I went back to the convenience store
and then I thank God your part check.

181
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:38,210
I'm full Chinese But for some reason I couldn't tell it
wasn't Jackie Chan.

182
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,250
Yeah, but thank you for the super chat.

183
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:40,810
Thank you.

184
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:50,030
Thank you So I would like, I like went back to visit the
convenience store and I looked at his face and I was like,

185
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,470
there is no resemblance to Jackie Chan.

186
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:55,690
I have no idea how the fuck that lie went.

187
00:17:56,310 --> 00:18:02,430
Like, how the fuck that lie lasted that long for me.

188
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:12,330
And it was around the time when Jackie Chan Adventures was
like playing on repeat, like reruns were always on, like on

189
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:13,430
YTV.

190
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:23,930
all the fucking time so obviously I was obsessed with Jackie
Chan uh because the reruns um the reruns were always on so I

191
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:32,990
love Jackie Chan a lot so then I was like oh my god I can't
believe Jackie Chan lived five minutes away from me at the

192
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:42,350
convenience store for some reason I thought like he just
lives there too um for some fucking reason I just thought he

193
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:52,630
lived at the convenience story as well uh why would jackie
chad work i don't i was five i was just so excited to meet

194
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:59,170
jackie chad i don't know why the fuck my parents lied about
that and the fact that he played i guess they're like

195
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:07,490
they're like you know he doesn't like because they're like
jackie chad's a little too real we gotta let her believe in

196
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:15,890
that uh because i'm like why the fuck were they willing to
like like give the young santa and a tooth fairy but then

197
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:24,210
lied for like three to four years about jackie chan working
at the convenience store like i have no idea why that was

198
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:36,910
the lie that they were willing to tell me uh mate thank you
for the super chat thank you thank you doesn't believe in

199
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:45,010

gullible sometimes but don't worry jargoons will never lead
you astray probably paturisu thank you for the super chat

202
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:09,470
thank you thank you oh my god but yeah those were some of
the things that my parents um used it's like you know what

203
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:15,850
it's understandable it's all that's like it's parenting you
know like you have to i don't understand why they had to lie

204
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:24,130
about the jackie chan thing but like some parents uh some
parents have to lie to their kids uh so they can make so

205
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:33,050
they can make parenting a lot easier uh mafumo thank you for
the super chat thank you thank you um now i'm just imagining

206
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:40,170
the family guy oh my god it's jackie chancy but it's dokey
they give us a super chat thank you Yeah, that was my

207
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:40,790
whimsy.

208
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:47,910
They didn't let me, they didn't try to let me believe in
Santa or Toothberry, but they definitely made me believe

209
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:51,490
that Jackie Chan was five minutes, lived five minutes away
from me.

210
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,270
Yeah, he was my Santa.

211
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:58,570
It's basic parenting.

212
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:02,910
You have to make your children believe in the grocery store,
Jackie Chan.

213
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,690
Anyway, it's Scooby-Doo.

214
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:14,890
night of a hundred frights so about this game i've always
wanted to play like replay this game for a very long time

215
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:20,510
because this is one of my childhood games i'd never be in it
because i never know i like didn't didn't really know how to

216
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:28,630
read instructions or uh or like follow instructions in
general so i was stuck on this game for the longest fucking

217
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:34,370
time i kept replaying i remember like same with the piglet
game i kept replaying it over and over again but i was

218
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:38,690
always stuck on the first or second level because I didn't
know how to progress.

219
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:43,050
I told the story before, but it's very similar to Pokemon
Crystal.

220
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:50,850
I think it was Pokemon Crystal where there was a part where
you're blocked on the forest area because you're supposed to

221
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:55,770
talk to like the people in the caves about like the slow
poke shit where they cut off the tails and stuff.

222
00:21:56,310 --> 00:22:03,050
So it was very similar to that where I never got past that
forest level because they blocked the forest level because

223
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:05,190
you have to progress through a side quest.

224
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:16,370
with the slowpoke tunnels but I didn't know how to read so I
I would I was like stuck there for like weeks like I would

225
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:21,750
replay that area and I was always stuck there for weeks
because I didn't really understand how to read at that time

226
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:33,530
um I knew how to read but I didn't process information I
just go like skip a skip a And so it only took like a couple

227
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:40,730
years later Where I replayed it And I actually started
processing information With what I was reading You know like

228
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:45,950
when you're reading it goes from one year to the other That
was me And that's still sometimes me too So yeah nothing has

229
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:52,950
actually really changed So but a couple years later I was
like I'm gonna see if I can actually progress this town And

230
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:57,890
I finally realized what the fuck They wanted me to do Oh
yeah, because I didn't know how to learn cut.

231
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,290
I remember now.

232
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:03,930
I was stuck on that level because there was a tree and I
didn't fucking know where to get cut.

233
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:11,730
I didn't realize that I had to, like, give the HM move to my
Pokemans.

234
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:16,350
So it's, like, all coming back to me.

235
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:23,390
It's because I didn't fucking realize that I had to teach a
move to my Pokemans.

236
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:26,030
So there was a fucking tree in front of me.

237
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:33,570
me and i was like how the do i get past the goddamn tree and
i kept running around everywhere being like is there another

238
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:46,610
way and i realized like oh my god like i didn't realize hm
or like was a tm moose or a fucking thing i was like how the

239
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:54,310
fuck do i get past this shit um um go ahead and say give a
super chat thank you thank you yo dokey you're playing this

240
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:56,670
game it was fun to me can't See how you do it.

241
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:56,930
P.S.

242
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:57,850
Santa was real.

243
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:01,190
The key word is was thank you for the super chat.

244
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:01,610
Thank you.

245
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:02,470
Thank you.

246
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:08,410
Yeah, I was stuck on there for fucking months, guys, because
I didn't understand.

247
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:17,370
I didn't understand because, like, Pokemon, Crystal and Gold
was my very first Pokemon's game.

248
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:24,070
So, I mean, yeah, so it was, like, my very first Pokemon's
game, like, the very first English Pokemon's game I could

249
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:26,030
play because my grandma would always give me.

250
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:36,890
me bootleg like always get me like those bootleg poke not
pokemon but those bootleg cartridges where it was like 15 it

251
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:43,270
was like you know like like a like a bunch of games in one
cartage and then there was there was like uh there was like

252
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:52,190
i remember there was like pokemon crystal in there but they
don't save that's the thing they the games the games don't

253
00:24:52,190 --> 00:25:01,590
save so when you play it It would just you can only play it
once Like you can only play it once fully You can't turn off

254
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:10,950
your like you you can't turn it off or you lose everything
It wipes everything because there's no save file So I had my

255
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:18,190
grandma got me that and it had like I think it had like the
original like the yellow Pokemon yellow and like Crystal and

256
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:25,530
everything and then that's where I was introduced to Pokemon
And I remembered while I tried playing those Pokemon yellow

257
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:31,890
and Pokemon crystal in those carnages I I would always like
to stop at a certain area and have to replay all the way to

258
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:38,650
that area And it was just me trying to speedrun myself being
like if I play this a little faster Maybe I get to see what

259
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:48,370
happens next like but then also the entire text was a
Japanese So so I was like I don't understand what's going on

260
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:57,090
like me trying to figure out okay if i press this button it
will go it would let me progress and i have to always

261
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:03,510
remember that so everything was in japanese and i'm like but
i don't know i can't obviously i i could barely read in

262
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:06,910
english let alone read a entirely new language

263
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:18,030
so so it was a it was a fucking ride i remember that from
from little dokey

264
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:23,530
There's a cute Pikachu right there.

265
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:29,450
Anyway, it's going to be a night of 100 frights.

266
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,110
Looking forward to playing it.

267
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:31,850
I don't know.

268
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:34,690
I don't know that...

269
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:40,250
I don't remember exactly the story or the gameplay.

270
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:44,450
It is a platformer because games back then were all mostly
platformers.

271
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,630
But it was a very fun platformer.

272
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:50,590
And I'm going to beat this game for Lil Doki because she
never could.

273
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:53,890
because she was always very confused.

274
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,390
I was stuck in a lot of games.

275
00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:00,570
Little Doki was stuck in a lot of games, including this one.

276
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:06,590
I'm playing the PlayStation 2 game, so the one that I grew
up with.

277
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,950
I'm doing it for young Doki.

278
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,190
I'll beat it for her.

279
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:16,130
There was a lot of games that I was stuck on, including
this.

280
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:25,810
Did the Little Doki ever watch the anime Scoot do we do

Scooby, Snack.

292
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:46,110
I like how they recreated it in 3D like the classic
animation zoinks dookie yeah I like that I like that they

293
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:54,390

favorite because it would always replay every it would

296
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:27,700
mystery.

297
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,060
A mystery?

298
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:30,440
Eh.

299
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,100
Oh, babe.

300
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,740
Let me know if it's better.

301
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:39,540
Oh my god, we have a live studio audience, too!

302
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:40,940
That's us!

303
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,760
To be honest, better than I thought for PS...

304
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,260
Okay, I'll tell you the reason why.

305
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,760
Oh, wait, I can't do it.

306
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,840
I can't adjust it.

307
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:55,580
Don't worry, I fixed the graphics.

308
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:59,640
It was not this HD before.

309
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:04,800
No, no, it, no, guys, the OG, no.

310
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,760
I fixed the graphics.

311
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:13,880
To make it look like how it looked like in our heads when we
were kids.

312
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:19,600
He was just about to unveil some new top secret invention
when he disappeared without a trace.

313
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,720
Oh my god, who kidnapped him?

314
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,920
Let's ask this teenagers instead of calling the cops.

315
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:30,440
Don't tell me Because it's haunted, right?

316
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,400
Yeah, Shaggy.

317
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,220
How'd you know?

318
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,380
I upped it up a bit.

319
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,820
Yeah, I overclocked the PS2, guys.

320
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:39,620
Geekers?

321
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,100
Don't worry, Holly.

322
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,400
We'll help you look around.

323
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,160
You said it, Daphne.

324
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,260
We're not afraid.

325
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,320
Right, gang?

326
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,840
Let's get a bunch of teenagers.

327
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:52,540
I just saw the disappearance of a high-ranking scientist.

328
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:55,460
You guys can go poking around scaring up some spooksters.

329
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,360
We're staying right here in the old mystery machine.

330
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,090
Only ghost-free environments for us.

331
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,200
Rip, roast weed.

332
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:05,380
Yeah.

333
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,440
Okay, you scaredy cats.

334
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:11,860
Stay here if you want.

335
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,260
Come on, guys.

336
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,160
See you later.

337
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,560
Yay, ghost-free.

338
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:21,040
You know, Scoob, I could really go for a...

339
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,240
Ruby snack.

340
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,740
A Ruby snack!

341
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,620
Yeah, it's the original.

342
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,280
Fred is all...

343
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:38,140
Fred's voice actor is still alive, too, and still doing Fred
voices.

344
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,320
I think that's crazy.

345
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,720
Everyone else retired, but Fred.

346
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,620
And he still sounds like him, too.

347
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:53,200
Gee, Scoob, it's not like they got your name all over him.

348
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,000
Well, actually, they do.

349
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:57,680
Scooby-Doo!

350
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:03,230
Who did Nintendo

351
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:11,610
down there?

352
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:19,710
But, um, but, uh, no, he got baited by the Scooby Snack.

353
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,610
It's the perfect bait.

354
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:23,490
Okay, press O to enter.

355
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:25,510
Okay, but I don't know how to play this game.

356
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:26,710
I forgot the controllers.

357
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:28,730
It's been so long.

358
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:30,230
Okay.

359
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:32,270
There's a warp game.

360
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,850
What the fuck is a warp game?

361
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,350
Are there no instructions?

362
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:38,430
I don't have double jump yet.

363
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:39,910
Oh, guys, I can save.

364
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,270
Let's save real quick.

365
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:42,650
I forgot.

366
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:46,090
Like, these old games, it's like there's no auto save back
then.

367
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:49,230
I need 25 scooby snacks.

368
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:53,810
Yeah, there's no auto save back then.

369
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,550
You have to physically find shit.

370
00:32:56,010 --> 00:33:00,510
You need a key to reach without the spring invention.

371
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:02,670
Okay, I got a spring invention here.

372
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:07,030
Alright, let's grab some more Scooby Snacks to unlock shit.

373
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:08,530
Alright, we got it.

374
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:11,150
Yeah, you need a game manuals.

375
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:13,810
Because, like, they don't actually give you the instructions
back then.

376
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:14,870
Like, in-game.

377
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:17,030
They just assume you could read the manual.

378
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:20,310
Which was an issue for me.

379
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:21,790
Because I couldn't read in general.

380
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:25,690
Yeah, it's save points.

381
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:27,230
Yeah, you screw up forgot to save.

382
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:28,250
Well, too bad.

383
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:29,870
Got me a key for this.

384
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:31,390
I'm just gonna grab all the Scooby Snacks.

385
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,510
Okay, 150.

386
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:36,290
Where's the playground here?

387
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:39,390
Alright, let's grab...

388
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:40,650
Let's go to Mystic Playground.

389
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:43,670
Used to go a little up?

390
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,190
Okay, I'll go up a little bit higher.

391
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:47,450
Alright, let me know if it's better.

392
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:48,310
Hello!

393
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:49,930
Hey, Scooby.

394
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:53,230
I'll give you some tips on some of the things you will find
around the Mystic Manor.

395
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:55,370
Make tracks, Scooby-Doo.

396
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:58,570
You can run faster by holding the R1 button while moving.

397
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,370
Jump by pressing the X button.

398
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:01,030
Oh, thank God.

399
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,850
Look for more of the clues to give you hints about the area.

400
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:04,610
You're in.

401
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:05,270
Okay.

402
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:05,870
Oh, okay.

403
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:06,970
I can run now.

404
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:09,430
Yes, there are a number of Scooby snacks that open.

405
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,350
Oh, thank God.

406
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:14,030
And lose a dog tag.

407
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:14,710
Eat some food.

408
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:15,830
It'll fill you back up.

409
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:16,370
Everything.

410
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:17,910
Don't worry.

411
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:20,050
I can fix all my problems with food.

412
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:23,250
These platforms look like they will probably stand on them
too, though.

413
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:23,610
Okay.

414
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:26,250
Alright, nice.

415
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:27,970
Oh, my God.

416
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:28,710
Okay, don't worry.

417
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:29,950
It'll rebuild itself.

418
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,680
Guys, it didn't rebuild itself.

419
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:52,280

How to dig.

427
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,400
How to be a dog.

428
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,740
Let's see who the witch really is.

429
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,680
That has turned up all over the place.

430
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,340
The char is very...

431
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,880
And it keeps you from running or jumping.

432
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:53,480
Oh, okay.

433
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,020
Never mind.

434
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,800
I thought I could dig there.

435
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:56,200
I don't know.

436
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,740
I thought I could be a fucking dog.

437
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:00,580
All right.

438
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,200

441
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:05,580
Oh, my God.

442
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,040
This game was ahead of its time.

443
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,780
Oh my god, this game truly was ahead of its time.

444
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,360
They had drones back then.

Sometimes I add four tablespoons of feather to my craft
dinner.

I did what it was during the, for the maid cafe.

468
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:34,360
I got it.

469
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,380
I got it once.

470
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:40,240
That was the high-alt chase for the rest of my life.

471
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,120
The one time I won the sleep, gotcha.

472
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:44,280
It was a 30-minute nap, and I was...

473
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:49,040
Okay, to be fair, I did come into the car very dead when we
were setting up.

474
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,960
But, like, it could have been worse.

475
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,000
It really...

476
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,060
Okay, I grabbed the key here.

477
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:58,480
Wait.

478
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,300
That...

479
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:00,540
Whoa!

480
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:01,740
Oh, it's okay.

481
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,480
I'm still okay.

482
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,940
I'm not that scared.

483
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,760
Wait, is that...

484
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,020
Is that Velma?

485
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,040
Oh my god, he's gonna do it again.

486
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:14,580
You'll find a professor's springing invention before you can
make this jump.

487
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I still tried it.

488
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:19,640
I thought I could glitch my way up.

489
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,280
Velma, is that you?

490
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:24,720
Where is she?

491
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:25,560
Wow!

492
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,940
Oh shit, there's the game.

493
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,740
Oh, it wasn't Velma.

494
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:32,040
Scooby-Doo, I'm so glad you found me.

495
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,940
Oh, it was just awful.

496
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:39,840
As soon as we got inside the mansion, It's her, isn't it?

497
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:40,820
It's...

498
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:44,160
No, it's her, isn't it?

499
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:44,980
It's...

500
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:45,280
It's...

501
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,740
He is behind my uncle's disappearance.

502
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,020
Then he pulled on a lever.

503
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,160
These trapped doors...

504
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,200
It's Daphne too.

505
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:56,080
Oh yeah, all of them except you?

506
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,860
No way.

507
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,220
It'll help you get around a little easier.

508
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:05,050
Alright, nice.

509
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:05,770
She got...

510
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:08,650
She did give me a map, so maybe she's not that evil.

511
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,050
Wait, how come I can't go through here?

512
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:11,930
That's a hole.

513
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:15,590
Alright, there's some bats here.

514
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:18,390
How do I...

515
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:20,990
How to push books in?

516
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:22,650
How do I...

517
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:23,990
Book is out.

518
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:26,430
How the paws have no thumbs.

519
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:31,410
My paw has no thumb.

520
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:32,350
How to push.

521
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:35,110
Oh, spooky.

522
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,410
I want to grab that spooky...

523
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:38,110
Scooby snack.

524
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:42,690
Wait, okay, oh, it takes my HP.

525
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:43,370
God damn it.

526
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:46,190
No!

527
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:50,520
It's fucking Chris's bait.

528
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,600
But there's a Scooby Snack, though.

529
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,060
It's a Scooby Snack.

530
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,000
Oh, I got it.

531
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I got the Scooby Snack.

532
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:02,100
Yeah, I need an invention for that.

533
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,080
All right.

534
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,560
You need a Professor's Helmet invention to bash through
these.

535
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,160
Oh, my God.

536
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,280
What can I do?

537
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,540
Oh, I think that's why I'm...

538
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:13,720
I understand why I've been stuck in this game.

539
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:18,860
I'm like, what do I do with all these inventions that I must
procure?

540
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,100
I fell for again.

541
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:22,780
Ross, thank you for the super chat.

542
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:23,720
Thank you, thank you.

543
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:26,480
Alright.

544
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,820
How do I open door?

545
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,180
I don't understand.

546
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,360
Oh shit, there's a bat here.

547
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,080
Yeah, I don't know how to double jump.

548
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,120
Wait, where's Daphne too?

549
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:45,040
I cannot go.

550
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,720
I do have a hundred now.

551
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,460
Okay, we can grab this.

552
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,160
Okay, I can grab food here.

553
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,660
Okay, bats hurt, guys.

554
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,020
I don't think I can go anywhere here.

555
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,820
I can't open doors.

556
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,460
It won't let me open a door.

557
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,360
I have no opposable thumbs.

558
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,960
Oh, I did get a key.

559
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,860
I didn't get a key, though.

560
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:05,760
Alright, let's save.

561
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:07,600
I'm very paranoid.

562
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,460
That's why I'm...

563
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,840
It's why I like a lot, like...

564
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:25,720
is to the gate huh well so am i i'm pretty sure it's oh i
can get a shovel here oh nice get to work first one standing

565
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:36,900
in a fire flower patch okay all right dig time oh i can
fucking i can dig i can use my thumb my non-opposible thumbs

566
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:43,680
to hold a shovel but i can't push a buck That's why, like, a
lot of people are so paranoid with saving.

567
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:47,780
Because, like, back then in the PlayStation 2 era, we had no
auto-saves.

568
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,480
Like, we gotta do what we could do.

569
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,500
Alright, just use that shovel.

570
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:00,080
Yeah, but that's why there was a lot of paranoia.

571
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:05,030
That's why I would save all the time.

572
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:07,870
Even when we have auto-saves.

573
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:11,710
Did I go to a smuggler cove now?

574
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:13,810
Oh, it's open.

575
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:16,170
I am still paranoid.

576
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:21,800
This is a...

577
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,800
Be careful not to fall.

578
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,800
I think this is the...

579
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,760
As far as I got.

580
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,680
I remember...

581
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:29,020
The only thing I remember was the fishing...

582
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,600
The fishing village.

583
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:31,600
This was definitely the...

584
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,720
As far as I got in this game for Little Doki.

585
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,120
I unlocked the fishing village and that was it.

586
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:45,600
I just didn't understand the concept of swapping.

587
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:46,580
I think it was like...

588
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:48,880
When you get inventions, you have to like...

589
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,560
Swap your items, and I didn't understand.

590
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,780
Timer jumps around the flying fish.

591
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:58,660
Where's the flying fish?

592
00:42:58,780 --> 00:42:59,880
Oh, there's the flying fish.

593
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:03,560
What am I going to do with this?

594
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:07,860
Oh, to grab Scooby snacks.

595
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:09,840
Oh my god.

596
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:11,180
Little Doki's going to be so proud.

597
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,100
Top of small monsters to squash them.

598
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:15,180
Rats.

599
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:15,960
Rats.

600
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:18,840
That's right.

601
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:31,280
it's not murder they have no rights in the animal hierarchy
I'm at on the top that's right no rats for you

602
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:40,220
uh you need one of the professors to feed larger monsters
try sneaking past the monsters while they're asleep or not

603
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:50,820
paying attention how the fuck do I sneak it didn't say how
oh my god oh my god Scooby Am I glad that he's in here, and

604
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:51,760
I'm out here?

605
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,500
Wait, what's up?

606
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:54,820
Full copy, pasta.

607
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,480
Yeah, I can't fucking sneak yet.

608
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,460
Okay, maybe I can do it from here.

609
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:04,200
Oh.

610
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:10,000
I don't need to sneak if I just go down from this side.

611
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:10,880
There we go.

612
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:12,260
Easy.

613
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:17,220
But what I want to know is, where's the caveman?

614
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:19,160
rat.

615
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:22,200
Am I glad that he's in there?

616
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:26,880
We're out and we're out here, but what I really want to know
is, where's the cave man?

617
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:30,560
Oh my god, please.

618
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:32,180
There you go.

619
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,120
I gotta kill this rat.

620
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,000
Wait, what's up here?

621
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:39,340
Oh, nice.

622
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:40,440
Okay, oh, Scooby Snack!

623
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,380
Hang on to the pelican for a shortcut back.

624
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,660
Be sure to grab all the goodies along the way.

625
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:47,340
Okay, pelican.

626
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,840
I don't have depth perception, please.

627
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:51,580
Please, this was the worst part about 3D games.

628
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,920
It tests my fucking depth perception.

629
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:56,420
Come on.

630
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:57,960
Where the fuck?

631
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:58,420
Okay, no.

632
00:44:58,820 --> 00:44:59,300
Come on.

633
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:00,720
Let me, let me, let me, come on.

634
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:01,640
Okay, there we go.

635
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:03,220
All right.

636
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:08,240
I'll grab all the Scooby snacks so I can unlock the areas.

637
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,380
All right, nice.

638
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:18,740
Well, I want to grab the Scooby snacks because that's what
we need to unlock more areas.

639
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:22,240
So I'm just grabbing them in advance so I don't have to
worry about it later.

640
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,640
Wait, he just drops me off?

641
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,300
Bro, what the fuck?

642
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:29,340
This is a round trip.

643
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,100
I thought this was a round trip.

644
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,840
Oh my god, it was single round.

645
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:40,920
I didn't know that it was a...

646
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,620
It's a shortcut back.

647
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:46,140
I'm gonna go down from this side.

648
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:49,560
Alright.

649
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:50,740
Whom?

650
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:51,920
Whom?

651
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:52,900
Whom?

652
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:53,840
Alright.

653
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,920
Yeah, I only paid for one way.

654
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:58,640
Did you guys know?

655
00:45:58,740 --> 00:45:59,880
I just found this out.

656
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:01,380
So like for me in Canada.

657
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,800
Oh, we're blocked.

658
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:06,400
Shaggy!

659
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:07,980
Wait, how did you get out of the tunnel?

660
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:10,260
Raggy!

661
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:10,920
Raggy!

662
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:18,200
What the fuck?

663
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,440
You were downstairs!

664
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:20,640
How did you get out?

665
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:25,260
It's locked.

666
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:26,700
Why it sure is.

667
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:27,640
Come on, pal.

668
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:29,840
Let me give you a hand or a leg.

669
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:32,680
Throw me up onto that life preserver.

670
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:35,560
Then you can swing from my legs to reach that crate.

671
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:36,800
Oh my god, nice.

672
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:37,700
We're okay.

673
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:39,920
We're okay, Raggy.

674
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:48,510
This is wrong.

675
00:46:53,590 --> 00:46:57,710
Man, Khan was not supposed to let this happen.

676
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:04,370
Rinse us, Ragey.

677
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:07,910
Just a couple of guys.

678
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:09,250
It's a dog!

679
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:16,570
Man's best friend, you know?

680
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,270
Man's best friend.

681
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:20,470
I'm gonna hang around here.

682
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:21,450
Can't get it.

683
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:22,610
Hang around.

684
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:24,990
I'll catch up with you later.

685
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:27,030
A man in his dog.

686
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:29,230
Scooby is up, bro.

687
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:33,950
I don't know if I can, like, grab the snacks.

688
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:38,330
No, I need double jump for that.

689
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:41,570
That's true friendship right there.

690
00:47:44,430 --> 00:47:46,210
I'll grab the Scooby snacks.

691
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:47,630
Oh, oh, row!

692
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:49,430
The kid bed!

693
00:47:50,090 --> 00:47:50,570
Oh!

694
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:52,270
Not the kid bed!

695
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:54,330
Shit, okay.

696
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:54,930
It's fine.

697
00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:55,430
I'm okay.

698
00:47:57,470 --> 00:47:58,190
It's okay.

699
00:47:58,370 --> 00:47:58,810
I'm okay.

700
00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:04,270
Yeah.

701
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:07,970
He's not frozen!

702
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:11,210
What's this?

703
00:48:13,650 --> 00:48:14,230
Where is it?

704
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:15,830
Oh, it's fast travel.

705
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:19,350
Oh, I don't give this very ahead of its time.

706
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:22,370
Oh, I can literally fast travel for this.

707
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:24,930
Go grab this.

708
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:27,550
Oh, I got 50.

709
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:28,210
Let's go.

710
00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:28,610
See?

711
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:31,290
This is why I grabbed all of this in case.

712
00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:35,010
Okay, I need a spring.

713
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:37,330
Alright, I need to find the professor's inventions.

714
00:48:37,930 --> 00:48:38,870
But I unlocked this area.

715
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:39,210
Oh, wait.

716
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:39,790
What's this?

717
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:41,650
Okay, never mind.

718
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:42,690
It's not unlocked yet.

719
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:46,710
I think this is as far as I got.

720
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:47,930
I'm pretty sure.

721
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:50,410
I'm pretty sure I was stuck on this entire water level.

722
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:53,150
There's a shortcut around the connection.

723
00:48:53,170 --> 00:49:02,010
what oh okay wait does it take me back oh

724
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:18,020

ah yes the famous Scooby-Doo warp gates in my Scooby-Doo

725
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:29,080
lore yeah I can't I can only walk away very slowly it's okay
the crab can't get me I somehow travel at least point one

726
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:46,230

accurate no waiting time oh no it's the fucking and it's the

727
00:49:46,230 --> 00:50:00,930
ghost divers yeah I can't just walk it's the spooky scuba go
scuba divers yeah Oh, there's the spring traps!

728
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:03,990
Okay, now I can do a double jump.

729
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:04,570
Yay!

730
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:09,330
Okay, I can double jump now.

731
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:13,530
I get anything up here?

732
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:15,870
Can I double jump back there?

733
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:18,990
Oh yeah, also, by the way, the cameras do not move.

734
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:20,090
Wait, what?

735
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:21,470
I don't get out of here.

736
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:25,570
Do I just have to slowly walk back?

737
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:26,590
Wait, is there...

738
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:27,410
Where's the pelican?

739
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:28,890
Get over here.

740
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:32,750
Yeah, you can't move the cameras in these old games, too.

741
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:34,830
A lot of them, you can't.

742
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:37,090
I guess I gotta slowly walk back.

743
00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:41,750
Oh, yeah, thank you, bro.

744
00:50:42,310 --> 00:50:42,790
Not...

745
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:44,030
Oh, I can't even go there.

746
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:46,050
Alright.

747
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:47,430
Rot roll.

748
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:49,770
I've got my double jump now.

749
00:50:57,810 --> 00:50:59,630
The long walk of victory.

750
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:03,390
Yeah, it's like fixed angles and everything.

751
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:05,050
I'll grab the sandwich.

752
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:06,090
I need that, actually.

753
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:16,110
Very nostalgic.

754
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:21,290
Yeah, it was on the PlayStation 2 on the GameCube.

755
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:25,650
I've only played it on the...

756
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:27,670
Okay, god damn it.

757
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:28,090
Okay, wait.

758
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:42,310

00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:07,090
Backtracking in my Scooby-Doo game?

762
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:10,890
You know, this is why Little Doki did not understand.

763
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:13,490
Holy shit.

764
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:15,310
I did not realize how...

765
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:17,170
Look, I was stuck on the fishing village.

766
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:19,770
I was literally stuck on level one, guys.

767
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:22,950
I never made it past...

768
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:26,110
I never made it past level one.

769
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:29,510
I did not realize all of this existed.

770
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:35,490
All right.

771
00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:37,050
Oh, no, it's a...

772
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:38,790
I don't remember which ghost...

773
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:42,170
What villain this was.

774
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:44,410
All right.

775
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:46,030
Oh.

776
00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:50,210
Seems to be locked on the other side.

777
00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:52,230
Okay, I gotta figure this out on the other side.

778
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:53,690
Whoa.

779
00:52:56,030 --> 00:52:57,650
Oh, I got the monster broken.

780
00:52:59,510 --> 00:52:59,910
All right.

781
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:02,930
We gotta go this way for the...

782
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:05,310
Can I double jump into this hole now?

783
00:53:05,470 --> 00:53:06,170
No, I can't.

784
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:10,410
Oh, wait, I can grab more Scooby Snacks here, though.

785
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:14,190
Yay, Scooby Snacks!

786
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:14,950
Is there more?

787
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:15,930
Yeah, there's another one.

788
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:19,430
Alright, I think I stockpiled enough Scooby Snacks.

789
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:22,750
This should unlock, like, at least three more places.

790
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:25,810
My non-Seroakin.

791
00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:29,350
Oh, my God, I can finally get that.

792
00:53:29,930 --> 00:53:32,290
Wait, what can I do with double jump?

793
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:34,710
Oh my god, I can't do anything in here.

794
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:35,890
I just...

795
00:53:35,890 --> 00:53:38,150
Okay, okay.

796
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:40,270
Okay, I...

797
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:40,890
Oh, no.

798
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:45,450
Present Doki is also confused, just like little Doki.

799
00:53:46,010 --> 00:53:46,350
Just like...

800
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:48,890
Oh, no.

801
00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:52,310
Adult Doki is also stuck.

802
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:56,670
Something about the...

803
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:57,910
Oh, I remember it.

804
00:53:57,910 --> 00:53:58,710
I remember it now.

805
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:01,150
Nothing changed.

806
00:54:01,590 --> 00:54:01,930
It was here.

807
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:02,350
It was here.

808
00:54:02,410 --> 00:54:03,290
It was the key right here.

809
00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:04,290
Okay, I got the key.

810
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:05,250
I got double jump.

811
00:54:06,370 --> 00:54:06,870
There we go.

812
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:08,430
Now we can go here.

813
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:16,100
Okay, we can go here now.

814
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:17,760
Wait, can I stomp?

815
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:18,140
Nice.

816
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,740
I can stomp on spiders.

817
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,440
On the other side.

818
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:24,020
Alright, so okay, I can go this way.

819
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:25,200
We're in a maze now.

820
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:28,460
I don't have to kill him, but I'm sending a message.

821
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:31,400
I'm gonna ruin the environment.

822
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:37,520
I'm going to destroy the ecosystem of this place.

823
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,040
That's right.

824
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:41,980
Can I need the helmet power up?

825
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:43,840
That's right.

826
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:44,640
I'm going to do it.

827
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:46,520
I kill all the spiders.

828
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:48,740
Oh my god, it's a fucking werewolf.

829
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,380
All right, who the fuck are employing all these actors?

830
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,140
It's like I'm in a real haunted house right now.

831
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:58,700
Wait, what's over here?

832
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:00,360
Oh, hey, it's a witch.

833
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:03,140
Okay, bye.

834
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:05,620
Just for a fucking sandwich?

835
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:06,860
What the fuck is that point?

836
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:12,340
I'm gonna grab another sandwich right here.

837
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:13,220
Oh, shit!

838
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,560
Okay, they better be paid a lot of money here, this
Scooby-Doo.

839
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,600
I startled the witch.

840
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:27,960
Yeah, whoever is...

841
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:30,600
Whoever...

842
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,820
Whoever is the mastermind of this shit.

843
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,160
Wait, is this good or bad?

844
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,440
Okay, that's a bad pot.

845
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:38,960
It's a bad Cauldron.

846
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:43,500
Doing very well in reducing the property value.

847
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:46,700
Okay, I can go here.

848
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:48,260
I'm so lost.

849
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:51,860
This map is a lot bigger than I thought it'd be.

850
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:54,980
Little Doki never got to experience this.

851
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:00,520
There are two of the Professor's Adventures, the Slippers
and the Lampshade.

852
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:05,580
You can use the Sliplers to sneak past the monsters by
holding R2 button while walking.

853
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:08,900
use the lampshade to hide from the monsters by holding R2.

854
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:12,620
Use your new lampshade and slippers to avoid the zombies
hiding.

855
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:13,360
Oh, hey!

856
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:14,540
Nice.

857
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:22,100
They'll never know.

858
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:24,840
Shh.

859
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,720
Be very, very quiet.

860
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:29,900
They'll never know.

861
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:31,740
They'll be like, why is there a lamp out here?

862
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,680
Why the fuck is there a lamp out here?

863
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:42,340
out here in the middle of this labyrinth maze.

864
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:45,420
Okay, wait.

865
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:46,760
Watch this.

866
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:48,300
Okay, wait.

867
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,660
You'll never know.

868
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:55,620
That there is a dog here.

869
00:56:58,880 --> 00:56:59,620
Alright, wait.

870
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:00,560
We gotta grab this.

871
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,100
Oh, that must be a spring.

872
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:05,220
Okay, that was not a spring.

873
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:06,760
Can I use this?

874
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,480
Oh, I can use this as a platform.

875
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:09,340
Nope, never mind.

876
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:09,680
I cannot.

877
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:12,440
I got a little hopeful there for a second.

878
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:14,420
Not even make it.

879
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:14,960
Oh, I can.

880
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,140
I'm hiding in plain sight.

881
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:20,260
Yeah, it's good practice for Metal Gear.

882
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:23,360
What's this?

883
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:24,820
Wait, that's shaggy.

884
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,600
Wait, that's also shaggy.

885
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:28,320
Wait, that's also shaggy.

886
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,660
Okay, that's a little creepy, bro.

887
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:35,560
I'm a little concerned why all the statues are just shaggy.

888
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:38,380
Apparently, we open from the other side.

889
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:39,680
Okay, but what if, like, I can't?

890
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:48,180
open it here oh it's a robbie oh it's a robbie whoa

891
00:57:54,440 --> 00:58:06,240
he still found me how did he go oh how did he do it's okay i
don't understand my disguise was perfect

892
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:12,900
My disguise is impenetrable.

893
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,760
I got that spirit Halloween.

894
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:16,940
Oh, God.

895
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:20,560
How the fuck do I get over here?

896
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:25,160
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

897
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,380
All right, all right, dig.

898
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:29,540
Grab the sandwich.

899
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:32,560
Oh, my God.

900
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:33,160
He's just walking.

901
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:33,640
He doesn't care.

902
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:36,220
He doesn't care.

903
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,080
Oh, hey, Shaggy.

904
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:47,200
Oh, hey!

905
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,260
I didn't realize those were...

906
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:52,480
What the fuck are these, like, thorns?

907
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:54,320
Can

908
00:58:57,710 --> 00:59:00,910
I just not fucking walk through branches?

909
00:59:02,850 --> 00:59:04,110
Does that make my paws hurt?

910
00:59:05,890 --> 00:59:07,490
Alright, here we go, Shaggy.

911
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:09,950
Whoa, whoa, whoa, this is very...

912
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:11,470
I do not feel shaved, Shaggy.

913
00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:13,470
Alright, it's okay.

914
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:16,030
The power of friendship.

915
00:59:18,610 --> 00:59:25,930

01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:05,320
Nice.

920
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:07,120
And there's firebuzz?

921
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:08,940
Oh, no.

922
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,500
I'm not feeling so good, Shaggy.

923
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:11,420
Raggy.

924
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:12,340
Raggy.

925
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,960
I'm losing my nine lives, Raggy.

926
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:16,260
No.

927
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:17,400
Oh, shit.

928
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:19,520
I'm so scared, Raggy.

929
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:23,060
You're a bad pet owner, Raki!

930
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:29,660
Okay, there you go.

931
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:33,900
Raki, I don't feel so good.

932
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:34,800
Okay, I'm okay now.

933
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:38,240
Not as scared anymore.

934
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:40,600
Raki, help!

935
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:43,960
Oh, it's fine.

936
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:44,940
Okay, God, I made it.

937
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:46,120
I made it across.

938
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,460
I want to grab this.

939
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:57,080
He's not a cat, okay.

940
01:00:58,140 --> 01:01:00,080
You might as well be.

941
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:02,220
All right, can I have enough?

942
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:03,380
I love your 50.

943
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:05,580
See, this is why I stockpiled, guys.

944
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:09,520
I have to stockpile my Scooby Snacks.

945
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:11,560
Cops.

946
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:14,180
Group of hippies over cops.

947
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,320
It's fine.

948
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:20,240
Okay, yes.

949
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:23,380
The fact that the Noah's Auto is so annoying.

950
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:24,500
spam it.

951
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:26,340
Okay, it's just all rats.

952
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:27,920
Got killed the rats.

953
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:30,780
I need the helmet for that.

954
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:35,780
Can't wait to backtrack all of this later.

955
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:36,880
Oh no, I'm scared.

956
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:39,080
Oh no, I'm so scared.

957
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:40,600
Where are the sandwiches?

958
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:44,580
Okay.

959
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:46,700
These are not sandwiches.

960
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:48,040
Oh, nice.

961
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:49,700
Okay, I...

962
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:52,080
I don't need to grab the...

963
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:55,700
run past these.

964
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:56,440
Oh, I cannot!

965
01:01:56,820 --> 01:01:57,180
I cannot!

966
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:00,820
I don't know why.

967
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:03,800
I don't know.

968
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:05,560
I thought I could just run past it.

969
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:11,280
Apparently, I was not built like that.

970
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:13,060
But I'm so scared.

971
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:16,920
Oh, God.

972
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:18,120
I'm so scared right now.

973
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:20,180
I have to go all the way back if I die here.

974
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:25,060
No, no, no, no, no!

975
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:28,220
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, where am I?

976
01:02:28,220 --> 01:02:30,100
Oh no, where's a rambi?

977
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:32,240
Oh no, not a rambi.

978
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:35,160
Oh, please tell me.

979
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:36,480
Okay, enter.

980
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:41,620
One HP and a dream.

981
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:44,120
Yeah, it's because he's a scaredy cat.

982
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:47,160
Where the fuck am I?

983
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:50,480
I lived.

984
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:52,920
That's right.

985
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:53,860
Not today.

986
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:56,760
Not today, zombie.

987
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:58,900
Not today.

988
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:02,520
Right this way.

989
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:05,240
Bro, there's just a lot of scooby snacks, bro.

990
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:06,440
I need a fucking sandwich.

991
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:08,080
I'm so hungry.

01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:11,820
Oh, God.

993
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:29,080

994
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:33,880

Little Doki was never progressing, was never finishing this
game.

999
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:15,360
Little Doki was never beating this game.

1000
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:20,410
It's just a lamp.

1001
01:04:20,510 --> 01:04:22,930
Yeah, it's a lamp in the middle of the fucking greenhouse.

1002
01:04:25,490 --> 01:04:29,430
And no wonder she only was, she was only in the water level.

1003
01:04:31,090 --> 01:04:32,210
It's another sandwich.

1004
01:04:32,370 --> 01:04:34,230
Okay, we need as much sandwiches as possible.

01:04:58,950 --> 01:05:06,550
Oh, oh, that's a tree branch I didn't even see it, it
blended right in Oh shit, okay, we're gonna grab the

1010
01:05:06,550 --> 01:05:12,450
sandwich A soapbox will replenish your soap bubbles when you
find that...

1011
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:14,450
What the fuck is a soap bubble?

1012
01:05:15,310 --> 01:05:17,110
What the fuck hit me?

1013
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:19,870
What the fuck hit me?

1014
01:05:20,130 --> 01:05:20,430
What?

1015
01:05:20,770 --> 01:05:22,250
What damaged me?

1016
01:05:22,950 --> 01:05:24,730
Oh my god, it's the goddamn tree.

1017
01:05:25,530 --> 01:05:26,690
It literally blends in.

1018
01:05:31,550 --> 01:05:32,970
Oh god, this... Okay.

1019
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:37,610
Where am I now?

1020
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:40,610
Oh, what did the...

1021
01:05:40,610 --> 01:05:40,910
Oh!

1022
01:05:42,830 --> 01:05:43,890
It's okay, we're fine.

1023
01:05:44,330 --> 01:05:45,070
We lost him.

1024
01:05:46,110 --> 01:05:47,370
We just ran...

1025
01:05:47,370 --> 01:05:47,970
Oh my god.

1026
01:05:48,270 --> 01:05:48,830
Oh my god.

1027
01:05:48,930 --> 01:05:49,730
It's okay, wait, wait, wait.

1028
01:05:49,930 --> 01:05:52,210
We lost him, guys.

1029
01:05:53,410 --> 01:05:54,150
Look at that.

1030
01:05:54,930 --> 01:05:58,310
We just ran a little bit further away, and we lost him.

1031
01:06:01,530 --> 01:06:01,970
Yeah.

1032
01:06:03,290 --> 01:06:04,210
Off we go.

1033
01:06:05,790 --> 01:06:07,190
Does this game have cutscenes?

1034
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:07,950
It does.

1035
01:06:08,290 --> 01:06:09,030
But we have...

1036
01:06:09,030 --> 01:06:09,630

Wait, okay, let's grab this first.

1042
01:06:52,590 --> 01:06:54,210
And then go here, and then grab the warp.

1043
01:06:55,550 --> 01:06:58,290
And then, I'll grab the headbash.

1044
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:00,110
Oh, God.

1045
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:01,250
That's right.

1046
01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:03,270
Got work on your aim, Grandma.

1047
01:07:06,530 --> 01:07:06,830
Okay.

1048

Oh, hey, cake.

1049
01:07:08,870 --> 01:07:09,290
Yum, yum.

1050
01:07:11,070 --> 01:07:12,210
Oh, my God, more cake.

1051
01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:15,110
Bats have cakes!

1052
01:07:17,210 --> 01:07:18,510
Oh my god, are you fucking kidding?

1053
01:07:18,690 --> 01:07:20,910
I have to go all the way back here!

1054
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:23,730
God damn it.

1055
01:07:24,190 --> 01:07:25,530
Oh god, I have to...

1056
01:07:25,530 --> 01:07:27,190
Oh, he doesn't have the cake anymore.

1057
01:07:28,170 --> 01:07:28,810
Is he also...

1058
01:07:28,810 --> 01:07:30,470
Oh, it's like a one-time thing.

1059
01:07:30,950 --> 01:07:32,750
Okay, these are like precise jumps.

1060
01:07:35,450 --> 01:07:35,970
Alright.

1061
01:07:36,890 --> 01:07:37,590
We're fine.

1062
01:07:41,650 --> 01:07:42,170
Okay.

1063
01:07:42,650 --> 01:07:49,930
Size jumps, parkour, platformers, my strongest game genre
ever, apparently.

1064
01:07:52,090 --> 01:07:52,910
Right, guys?

1065
01:07:53,090 --> 01:07:55,330
I'm so good at platformers.

1066
01:07:57,030 --> 01:08:01,710
One of my all-time favorite games, actually just fully
playing again recently, Venice, thank you, the Super Chat,

01:08:01,790 --> 01:08:02,430
thank you, thank you.

1068
01:08:02,450 --> 01:08:05,890
I remember enjoying this game a lot, even though I only was
in one level.

1069
01:08:06,570 --> 01:08:09,550
Even though, like, I only made it to the water level.

1070
01:08:11,050 --> 01:08:12,570
Which was the very first level.

1071
01:08:12,650 --> 01:08:27,110
I still enjoyed it with a very limited With a very very
Limited scope Okay Oh my god it's not that thank god You

1072
01:08:27,110 --> 01:08:38,670
think I can bash that Found a helmet I can press square to
dash ahead and bash the objects Oh I can bash the monsters

1073
01:08:38,670 --> 01:08:43,310

I murdered someone!

1082
01:08:53,230 --> 01:08:54,010
Let's go!

1083
01:08:55,350 --> 01:08:56,370
Oh my god.

1084
01:08:56,690 --> 01:08:56,870
Okay, wait.

1085
01:08:57,530 --> 01:08:58,030
No!

1086
01:08:58,470 --> 01:08:58,670
Wait!

1087
01:08:58,890 --> 01:08:59,350
Speedrun.

1088
01:08:59,930 --> 01:09:00,410
Speedrun.

1089
01:09:00,650 --> 01:09:01,230
It takes me at the bottom.

1090
01:09:01,650 --> 01:09:01,710
Yay!

1091
01:09:02,770 --> 01:09:03,990
Plan, guys.

1092
01:09:05,190 --> 01:09:06,550
Guys, it's planned.

1093
01:09:08,190 --> 01:09:09,210
Fully planned.

1094
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:11,330
Let's go.

1095
01:09:12,930 --> 01:09:13,370
Yeah!

1096
01:09:14,310 --> 01:09:14,630
Murder!

1097
01:09:16,050 --> 01:09:19,090
The thing is, I actually have to go back because there was a
web right there.

1098
01:09:20,350 --> 01:09:24,550
Okay, maybe it's not much of a speedrun because I realize I
have to go back.

1099
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:28,130
Oh, okay, nice.

1100
01:09:31,470 --> 01:09:33,150
There was, like, a web area.

1101
01:09:34,990 --> 01:09:37,730
So not as speedrunning as I thought it was gonna be.

1102
01:09:40,190 --> 01:09:41,170
Fuck, it's a web.

1103
01:09:43,910 --> 01:09:46,590
There you go.

1104
01:09:47,090 --> 01:09:48,350
Okay, it's right over here.

1105
01:09:49,650 --> 01:09:50,490
I can't believe...

1106
01:09:50,490 --> 01:09:51,750
You can't trial a dog.

1107
01:09:52,510 --> 01:09:53,190
Oh, wait, you can.

1108
01:09:53,650 --> 01:09:58,930
Wait, wait.

1109
01:09:59,370 --> 01:09:59,870
You're right.

1110
01:10:00,150 --> 01:10:00,790
You can't...

1111
01:10:00,790 --> 01:10:03,370
To be honest, you actually can't trial a dog.

1112
01:10:03,730 --> 01:10:06,110
But, like, the punishment is way worse.

1113
01:10:07,690 --> 01:10:08,310
Like...

1114
01:10:08,310 --> 01:10:10,950
The punishment is really bad.

1115
01:10:11,330 --> 01:10:12,430
Where the fuck am I?

1116
01:10:15,150 --> 01:10:18,530

What the- What is this map?

1125
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:17,980
It's not even a map!

1126
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:20,300
What am I looking at?

1127
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:22,340
Okay.

1128
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:26,620
What am I even looking at?

1129
01:12:27,020 --> 01:12:28,860
Like, I'm so confused.

1130
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:31,040
Like, yeah.

1131
01:12:32,620 --> 01:12:34,800
This map is a circle.

1132
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:42,760
Okay, so, they're like, yeah, I'm gonna go to, like, like,
um, this, uh, this state over there, and I was like, oh,

1133
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:46,900
shit, like, you're flying so much, like, isn't it expensive?

1134
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:51,580
And then, my friend was like, no, it's, like, $50, and I'm
like, what?

1135
01:12:54,260 --> 01:12:58,260
I'm like What the fuck do you mean?

1136
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:10,860
It's only $50 To fly To a different state in America So like
Apparently in America There's like super fucking cheap

1137
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:17,420
airlines Like I don't know Like I think it's called like
Spirit I don't know I don't know what the fuck your airlines

1138
01:13:17,420 --> 01:13:30,040
are But like There's multiple like fucking cheap airlines in
um in america to the point where he can pay fifty dollars to

1139
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:34,220
fly like i was like okay what the were

1140
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:51,940
yeah spirit and frontier i was looking crazy it's like i
think i'm going back to where i came from i'm so lost Yeah,

1141
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:53,840
but that doesn't exist in Canada.

1142
01:13:54,140 --> 01:13:55,360
We don't have that.

1143
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:58,380
We have to pay, like, minimum, like, $200.

1144
01:14:02,420 --> 01:14:06,720
I guess if you're flying really fast somewhere, it doesn't
really matter if it's terrible.

1145
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:09,400
The thing you gotta be scared of is just losing your
luggage.

1146
01:14:09,740 --> 01:14:12,960
Just don't do, like, super long flights, and then you should
be fine, right?

1147
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:14,020
Right?

1148
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:15,140
It's a whale.

1149
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:21,420
Yeah, so that's why it's like, so that's why it's, like,
people in America can fucking just fly.

1150
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:25,260
like fly all over the place without worrying

1151
01:14:29,250 --> 01:14:35,990
it is real i looked it up and then my friend was like yeah
look up the flight tickets right now and it was 58 i was

1152
01:14:35,990 --> 01:14:44,990
like what the fuck it's literally 58 i forgot which state i
was like looking at it was like there's like they're like

1153
01:14:44,990 --> 01:14:48,650
yeah look up blank to uh to this to this and i was

1154
01:14:53,430 --> 01:14:55,210
As long as you don't have, like, too much luck.

1155
01:14:55,350 --> 01:14:57,270
I guess if you do a carry-on, I guess.

1156
01:14:57,750 --> 01:15:01,870
Like, if you do a carry-on, it doesn't, like, matter too
much.

1157
01:15:05,670 --> 01:15:09,490
Just don't grab, like, actual, like, big luggage.

1158
01:15:11,610 --> 01:15:15,430
Doki, imagine a carry-on delaying your flight because she's
having a...

1159
01:15:16,510 --> 01:15:18,770
Oh, well, telling you to see if the chat thing can think.

1160
01:15:18,870 --> 01:15:19,590
Oh, no!

1161
01:15:20,310 --> 01:15:21,730
This is not what I wanted.

1162
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:32,380
yeah they'll get you there all right we gotta do this again

1163
01:15:38,690 --> 01:15:44,910
that's actually just insane to think like flights are that
cheap right now in america not right now but you guys have

1164
01:15:44,910 --> 01:15:59,170
flights that cheap where the fuck is my fast travel Colin
Spirit I was gonna say run by warlocks Your soul and wallet

1165
01:15:59,170 --> 01:16:05,950
are not mated To the destination intact The things you do
For a $50 flat

1166
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:22,440
I should have went backwards I didn't realize this would
take longer I'm rummy Rummy Oh raggy get over here I got

1167
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:28,620
lost This was a maze It was a very it was a singular pathway
maze and I still got lost.

1168
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:33,480
It was incredibly streamlined.

1169
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:36,860
I still found a way to get lost.

1170
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:45,640
Alright.

1171
01:16:49,810 --> 01:16:53,330
The rest of the affair is paid in faith in humanity.

1172
01:16:53,770 --> 01:16:55,590
Thank you for the super chat, Papa.

1173
01:16:55,730 --> 01:16:56,110
Thank you.

1174
01:16:56,390 --> 01:16:56,730
Thank you.

1175
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:04,290
Oh yeah, but then you guys can also drive, too.

1176
01:17:04,370 --> 01:17:05,030
That's a crazy ride.

1177
01:17:05,030 --> 01:17:13,270
I remember in the maid cafe people were like oh yeah like i
i drove from a different state okay there we go where am i

1178
01:17:14,430 --> 01:17:16,370

1179
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:32,080

right where am i

1180
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:39,040
did i not activate this oh my God.

1181
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:41,380
I thought there was a warp gate.

1182
01:17:45,790 --> 01:17:48,430
Yeah, people were just driving, like, from a...

1183
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:55,810
I was like, but in Canada, you can't just drive to another
like, another province.

1184
01:17:58,490 --> 01:18:03,250
That doesn't exist when you can't just drive over to another
province.

1185
01:18:03,630 --> 01:18:04,950
That would take us days.

1186
01:18:06,750 --> 01:18:07,310
So here?

1187
01:18:09,890 --> 01:18:10,390
Wait.

1188
01:18:10,490 --> 01:18:11,650
you can't.

1189
01:18:14,510 --> 01:18:17,270
But it would take us a very long time.

1190
01:18:19,150 --> 01:18:19,250
This.

1191
01:18:19,590 --> 01:18:21,250
Oh my god, I was going this way.

1192
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:30,160
Is it?

1193
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:30,640
Oh, there you go.

1194
01:18:30,660 --> 01:18:31,480
I want to go here.

1195
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:31,900
Okay.

1196
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:33,420
Where does this lead?

1197
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:39,720
Use the Super Smash to activate and are you fucking kidding?

1198
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:40,840
Oh my god.

1199
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:43,120
I walked all the way back and I can't even activate this.

1200
01:18:43,420 --> 01:18:47,380
I Okay, that's okay, okay, all right.

1201
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:50,360
So I can activate that, guys.

1202
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:55,820
Okay, I walked all the way back here for no fucking reason.

1203
01:18:55,980 --> 01:18:56,400
It's okay.

1204
01:18:56,860 --> 01:18:57,360
It's okay.

1205
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:58,840
We'll go back to the web.

1206
01:19:02,980 --> 01:19:03,760
It's bad.

1207
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:04,980
We'll just go all the way back.

1208
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:06,480
We'll go to the web area.

1209
01:19:08,380 --> 01:19:10,600
I did these jumps so many times.

1210
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:12,480
I've done these jumps before.

1211
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:13,400
Okay.

1212
01:19:14,260 --> 01:19:15,960
That is just so natural now.

1213
01:19:21,570 --> 01:19:22,110
Oh, it's fine.

1214
01:19:22,310 --> 01:19:22,610
It's fine.

1215
01:19:23,150 --> 01:19:23,970
I can take one.

1216
01:19:24,330 --> 01:19:25,150
One damage.

1217
01:19:28,190 --> 01:19:28,390
Oh, yeah.

1218
01:19:28,410 --> 01:19:29,910
Speaking of, like, traveling.

1219
01:19:30,530 --> 01:19:34,550
You guys hear about how, like, because I saw someone talking
about the strikes and stuff.

1220
01:19:36,710 --> 01:19:43,070
Apparently, I mean, I know it's, like, super common in
France, too, for people that go on strikes all the time.

1221
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:52,630
Like, apparently, like, every couple of weeks, you have to
deal with, like, some union or some um some workplace going

1222
01:19:52,630 --> 01:20:02,270
on strike oh my god i could have just went home oh okay
that's okay that's okay i needed to go here anyway yeah it's

1223
01:20:02,270 --> 01:20:10,890
in the culture so apparently disneyland paris is on strike
right now um and like it's all the cleaners and it's like

1224
01:20:10,890 --> 01:20:18,790
the cleaners too that's on strike on disneyland paris so
like apparently it's like super Oh, I can open this now.

1225
01:20:19,570 --> 01:20:22,010
Why do I need, like, my fucking head for that?

1226
01:20:22,330 --> 01:20:25,150
I can use, operate a shovel.

1227
01:20:27,330 --> 01:20:31,430
Yeah, so the workers at Disneyland Paris are on strike.

1228
01:20:31,750 --> 01:20:37,010
So it's, like, super fucking dirty and everything right now
at Disneyland Paris, where the garbage is, like, everywhere.

1229
01:20:38,030 --> 01:20:42,070
And the thing was that...

1230
01:20:42,070 --> 01:20:42,210
All right.

1231
01:20:42,370 --> 01:20:43,170
Oh, hey, nice.

1232
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:44,210
Chicken was in him.

1233
01:20:45,430 --> 01:20:46,490
Oh, my God.

1234
01:20:46,590 --> 01:20:47,430
What the fuck?

1235
01:20:47,450 --> 01:20:56,570
it's okay i can oh oh he doesn't die okay we gotta leave oh
wait i think that's a that has to be there has to be a

1236
01:20:56,570 --> 01:21:06,130
monster in there oh but then there's a swooby snack oh it's
okay we'll just go this way yeah apparently it's like but

1237
01:21:06,130 --> 01:21:17,610
like the thing is they couldn't like they can't like uh stop
the like close the park down because people already bought

1238
01:21:17,610 --> 01:21:26,090
the tickets like years in like not years months in advance
so so they can't stop the they can't just close down the

1239
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:34,650
park because closing them down the park makes them lose even
more money than just like then running then have it like run

1240
01:21:34,650 --> 01:21:42,210
as it is all right cake yeah it's just not getting clean now

1241
01:21:45,530 --> 01:21:52,210
also apparently you know how i said really wanted to speak
your theme parks i said i really wanted to go to like epic

1242
01:21:52,210 --> 01:22:09,850
universe um apparently wait times for one ride is like five
hours i'm like for one ride at uh epic universe that's

1243
01:22:09,850 --> 01:22:19,330
insane i'm taking that there you go it's okay i just touched
the fire a little bit.

1244
01:22:19,470 --> 01:22:19,670
Look at that.

1245
01:22:19,690 --> 01:22:20,870
Wait, I don't keep it?

1246
01:22:21,470 --> 01:22:22,530
What the fuck's the point?

1247
01:22:22,750 --> 01:22:23,790
It said I took it.

1248
01:22:25,390 --> 01:22:26,250
That's bullshit.

1249
01:22:26,790 --> 01:22:28,810
I should have been able to keep the fucking key.

1250
01:22:29,790 --> 01:22:32,130
How do I turn off the goddamn stove?

1251
01:22:33,850 --> 01:22:36,470
Tokey fire bad tokey.

1252
01:22:37,550 --> 01:22:38,970
Yeah, but there's a key.

1253
01:22:43,230 --> 01:22:44,550
Oh, the starter's lag.

1254
01:22:45,650 --> 01:22:46,950
A double jump it.

1255
01:22:48,810 --> 01:22:50,130
Yeah, but I think that's insane.

1256
01:22:50,190 --> 01:22:51,310
Oh, wait, I did it.

1257
01:22:51,710 --> 01:22:52,890
I turned on the sprinklers.

1258
01:22:54,390 --> 01:22:55,950
Yeah, it hasn't even been a year.

1259
01:22:56,410 --> 01:23:00,950
And wait time is like five to six hours for one ride.

1260
01:23:01,770 --> 01:23:05,210
People were saying it's because there's not enough rides in
Epic Universe.

1261
01:23:05,530 --> 01:23:06,470
Oh, my God, I did it.

1262
01:23:06,810 --> 01:23:07,670
God damn, it's time.

1263
01:23:08,110 --> 01:23:09,550
I didn't know it was time.

1264
01:23:13,860 --> 01:23:14,240
All right.

1265
01:23:14,820 --> 01:23:15,880
We gotta go fast.

1266
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,200
We gotta go so fast.

1267
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:21,740
Okay.

1268
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:23,360
I got the key.

1269
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:25,660
And I also got a sandwich too.

1270
01:23:26,060 --> 01:23:26,100
Delicious.

1271
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:26,760
Yum, yum.

1272
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:28,160
What is Epic Universe?

1273
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:30,680
It's the newest universal theme park.

1274
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:34,300
So they have like how to train your dragon land.

1275
01:23:35,620 --> 01:23:36,900
The monster land.

1276
01:23:37,300 --> 01:23:38,000
I don't know what it's called.

1277
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:40,340
The monster universe land.

1278
01:23:41,180 --> 01:23:42,340
What the fuck?

1279
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:44,440
Azir.

1280
01:23:47,180 --> 01:23:49,020
I don't remember what the other lands were.

1281
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:50,840
But these were the two I remember the most.

1282
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:52,500
Because they were really cool.

1283
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:55,100
The Toofless and Hiccup were really cool.

1284
01:23:57,220 --> 01:23:59,940
Yeah, like one rat is, like, I don't know.

1285
01:24:00,020 --> 01:24:00,620
That's crazy.

1286
01:24:00,740 --> 01:24:02,500
That's like, you lost, like, half the day.

1287
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:05,180
Like, I do not want to be in queue for half a day.

1288
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:06,560
Oh, I'm full HP.

1289
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:15,000
Like, I could do, like, other stuff with my time.

1290
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:16,440
Oh, yeah.

1291
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:19,400
And the people were saying that it's cheaper.

1292
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:22,960
It's cheaper to fly to Japan and go to Tokyo.

1293
01:24:22,980 --> 01:24:31,680
Disneyland than to fucking fly to Florida to go to
Disneyland that's insane the fact that it's cheaper to go to

1294
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:38,680
the other side of the world for Disneyland than it is to
like go to one in-state like if you're flying to like if

1295
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:47,900
you're from America it's actually is cheaper especially the
currency too people are saying it's also because like

1296
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:59,660
currency in um like USD the yen is like good right now yeah
florida is fucking expensive like getting hotels hotels uh

1297
01:24:59,660 --> 01:25:07,320

apparently parking is crazy that is crazy expensive what the

1298
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:20,140
fuck he's just there oh my god that's a ghost ghost whoa i
didn't realize how expensive parking can be because i i

1299
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:33,560

because i at the park because i don't drive oh i

1303
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:10,580
Yeah, every time I went to Japan, majority of times I went
to Japan, it's just a business trip.

1304
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:13,360
Okay, I need four keys to open this.

1305
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:14,920
Oh my god, he's just chasing me.

1306
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:15,580
It's okay.

1307
01:26:16,420 --> 01:26:18,700
I am just fast enough.

1308
01:26:18,900 --> 01:26:20,080
But where's the last key, though?

1309
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:21,840
Where the fuck is the last key?

1310
01:26:21,940 --> 01:26:23,260
Oh my god, it's all the way here.

1311

That's right.

I got the hot ground now.

1315
01:26:32,350 --> 01:26:32,950

1319
01:26:43,230 --> 01:26:44,030
Oh, we closed.

1320
01:26:46,690 --> 01:26:47,090
Right.

1321
01:26:47,570 --> 01:26:48,970
It's a headless tractor.

1322
01:26:50,130 --> 01:26:52,110
I really want to go to the Nintendo.

1323
01:26:52,210 --> 01:26:53,390
Yeah, the Nintendo Land.

1324
01:26:54,070 --> 01:26:54,890
What's this over here?

1325
01:26:54,950 --> 01:26:56,630
Oh, it's more Ruby's Racks.

1326
01:26:57,670 --> 01:26:58,250
Ruby Racks.

1327
01:27:02,530 --> 01:27:04,050
All right, over here, I'll go.

1328
01:27:05,370 --> 01:27:07,170
Jesus, there's all monsters everywhere.

1329
01:27:08,130 --> 01:27:08,790
Yay, murder!

1330
01:27:12,330 --> 01:27:13,190
Let's go!

1331
01:27:15,170 --> 01:27:16,470
Make sure I've did a disclaimer.

1332
01:27:16,630 --> 01:27:17,650
You know how haunted houses are?

1333
01:27:17,690 --> 01:27:18,930
Like, don't touch the actors?

1334
01:27:21,730 --> 01:27:22,750
Also, he's a dog.

1335
01:27:22,850 --> 01:27:23,470
He can't read.

1336
01:27:23,910 --> 01:27:24,790
He doesn't know that.

1337
01:27:26,070 --> 01:27:26,610
All right.

1338
01:27:27,810 --> 01:27:28,990
He's also a dog.

1339
01:27:29,070 --> 01:27:29,950
He doesn't know that.

1340
01:27:31,270 --> 01:27:33,190

We're not doing that again.

1349
01:29:13,810 --> 01:29:15,530
My death perception ain't working right now.

1350
01:29:21,030 --> 01:29:22,690
Well, I'm not talking about the creeper.

1351
01:29:22,770 --> 01:29:24,390
I'm talking about the monster token.

1352
01:29:24,630 --> 01:29:25,670
The guy with the mask.

1353
01:29:26,890 --> 01:29:28,050
He's not an A-lister.

1354
01:29:29,090 --> 01:29:31,110
He wasn't in the Scooby-Doo movies.

1355
01:29:32,870 --> 01:29:34,270
In the live action.

1356
01:29:37,450 --> 01:29:37,930
Right?

1357
01:29:39,610 --> 01:29:43,030
See, the ghost, he was an A, he's an A-Lister.

1358
01:29:43,550 --> 01:29:45,950
If that was his monster token, I'd get it.

1359
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:52,400
Alright, this way.

1360
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:54,760
Wait.

1361
01:29:55,460 --> 01:29:56,620
Yeah, the witch doctor.

1362
01:29:57,480 --> 01:29:58,840
See, I didn't even remember his name.

1363
01:30:00,940 --> 01:30:02,560
Scooby didn't even call him by his name.

1364
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:05,320
If he was an A-Lister, Scooby would be like, Oh, Ro!

1365
01:30:05,820 --> 01:30:07,500
The witch, the rich doctor!

1366
01:30:11,820 --> 01:30:13,020
Well, he didn't say it.

1367
01:30:16,550 --> 01:30:19,190
Okay, now I gotta wait for that, I guess.

1368
01:30:20,130 --> 01:30:21,050
Excuse me, yeah.

1369
01:30:21,210 --> 01:30:23,690
Oh, oh my god, he's doing round trip, too.

1370
01:30:26,630 --> 01:30:28,170
He's doing a fucking round trip.

1371
01:30:31,610 --> 01:30:32,850
See, there's no shadow.

1372
01:30:33,030 --> 01:30:35,490
It's so hard to see without the shadow at the bottom.

1373
01:30:37,110 --> 01:30:38,250
Tell me where to go.

1374
01:30:39,630 --> 01:30:40,170
There you go.

1375
01:30:43,610 --> 01:30:44,070
I don't know.

1376
01:30:44,610 --> 01:30:46,590
I don't know if there's anything important down there.

1377
01:30:47,730 --> 01:30:55,430
risky i feel like i have to wait for another round trip if i
go down yeah i'm not risking this i'm just gonna head

1380
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:20,100
I knew it.

1381
01:31:20,700 --> 01:31:21,580
I fucking knew it.

1382
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:26,760
They always get me what I least expected it.

1383
01:31:29,660 --> 01:31:31,020
There's a warp gate.

1384
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:32,540
There's a warp gate over there.

1385
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:33,680
Then what's behind me?

1386
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:38,540
Anything back here?

1387
01:31:39,220 --> 01:31:40,880
Oh, it's just more Scooby Snacks.

01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:41,920
Oh, wait.

01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:42,540

no.

1400
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:26,300
A lot of the older platform games is just all about
backtracking.

1401
01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:30,420
Thanks for the funny stream so far.

1402
01:33:30,660 --> 01:33:31,400
Glad we head to bed now.

1403
01:33:31,480 --> 01:33:32,860
See you all in the bots tomorrow.

1404
01:33:33,220 --> 01:33:34,160
Thank you, the super chat.

1405
01:33:34,360 --> 01:33:35,160
Thank you, thank you.

1406
01:33:35,220 --> 01:33:36,500
I'm glad you've been having a good time.

1407
01:33:36,740 --> 01:33:39,520
It's nice being able to play these nostalgic games too for
you.

1408
01:33:39,540 --> 01:33:51,740
as finally accomplishing something that little dokey did it
like all of this i'm like i've never seen any of this before

1409
01:33:51,740 --> 01:34:08,940
i'm just like i've never been here before god damn it i like
got hit by the chandelier this place is not safe What the

1410
01:34:08,940 --> 01:34:09,280
fuck?

1411
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:10,600
Wait, why is he here?

1412
01:34:11,660 --> 01:34:13,340
Wait, is there anything on the other side?

1413
01:34:13,940 --> 01:34:14,920
I'm gonna double check.

1414
01:34:19,460 --> 01:34:20,540
I wish...

1415
01:34:20,540 --> 01:34:21,680
I wish we get another...

1416
01:34:22,300 --> 01:34:23,660
Are you fucking kidding me?

1417
01:34:23,660 --> 01:34:24,860
Oh my god.

1418
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:25,780
You know what?

1419
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:27,360
What a remaster of?

1420
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:30,120
Would not remaster.

1421
01:34:30,700 --> 01:34:36,500
I wish toys for bots would make another Spyro game inspired
by like...

1422
01:34:36,680 --> 01:34:48,680
the original trilogy Spyro is like my top favorite game of
all time I'll still say Professor Layton is my most favorite

1423
01:34:48,680 --> 01:35:02,520
but I want Spyro is like number two I want Spyro game but
made by Toys for Bob yeah Toys for Bob what the fuck I did

1424
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:08,560
not expect all of this because I went the other way instead
of the way where the guy was just chilling.

1425
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:10,260
Like, where did this go?

1426
01:35:15,940 --> 01:35:17,600
Is this going to take me anywhere?

1427
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:19,940
Oh,

1428
01:35:25,610 --> 01:35:27,090
that was the witch docker.

1429
01:35:27,290 --> 01:35:28,910
Where the fuck am I?

1430
01:35:31,610 --> 01:35:32,710
Oh, my God.

1431
01:35:32,730 --> 01:35:35,970
Because I was debating if I should talk to the guy and I was
just sitting there.

1432
01:35:38,890 --> 01:35:39,490
Oh, my God.

1433
01:35:39,550 --> 01:35:41,330
This map is so fucking big.

1434
01:35:42,510 --> 01:35:44,430
Wait, how do I get to that side then?

1435
01:35:44,510 --> 01:35:47,270
Oh, do I need Raggy's help?

1436
01:35:49,730 --> 01:35:51,650
Oh, Manga, I need Raggy to be here.

1437
01:35:57,510 --> 01:35:57,730
Yeah.

1438
01:35:58,010 --> 01:36:03,430
But, you know, like, because, like, all the fucking future
Spiral iterations were so bad.

1439
01:36:03,570 --> 01:36:04,350
We're so trash.

1440
01:36:05,350 --> 01:36:06,850
Like, after the trilogy.

1441
01:36:10,410 --> 01:36:12,370
I will say that one was Cinder.

1442
01:36:13,250 --> 01:36:15,110
I think it was, but her name is Cinder, right?

1443
01:36:15,570 --> 01:36:16,910
Like, Spiral's girlfriend?

1444
01:36:17,330 --> 01:36:18,310
That one was okay.

1445
01:36:19,350 --> 01:36:19,870
All right.

1446
01:36:21,790 --> 01:36:25,850
But, like, I still think the trilogy was the best out of all
of them.

1447
01:36:31,580 --> 01:36:32,000
Yeah.

1448
01:36:35,320 --> 01:36:38,640
You know, one, the trilogy with, like, where Spyro got a
girlfriend.

1449
01:36:43,310 --> 01:36:44,610
See, okay, the witch doctor?

1450
01:36:45,010 --> 01:36:45,770
That's A-list.

1451
01:36:46,290 --> 01:36:48,170
You guys got confused with the other guy.

1452
01:36:48,450 --> 01:36:49,730
The other guy with a mask.

1453
01:36:50,190 --> 01:36:51,610
Like, I remember this guy.

1454
01:37:00,580 --> 01:37:01,560
Alright, there you go.

1455
01:37:04,220 --> 01:37:07,140
No, I don't count Skylanders as Spyro.

1456
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:11,560
That was just like, Spyro was not even like...

1457
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:16,360
I feel like Spyro, too, um, in Skylanders was just like an
add-on.

1458
01:37:16,540 --> 01:37:19,500
He wasn't like, he was like a, like a side character.

1459
01:37:20,180 --> 01:37:21,620
He didn't feel like a main character.

1460
01:37:26,260 --> 01:37:27,060
Okay, yeah, this guy.

1461
01:37:27,180 --> 01:37:28,080
Okay, I was gonna say it.

1462
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:31,940
The door is taking you back to the first room in the
mansion.

1463
01:37:32,060 --> 01:37:33,540
I should clean up these webs, but I think I'll just...

1464
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:34,580
stand around here for a little.

1465
01:37:34,860 --> 01:37:35,880
What was the point?

1466
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:42,220
What was the point of me going around in a circle?

1467
01:37:43,540 --> 01:37:44,860
Yeah, it was just there to sell.

1468
01:37:45,660 --> 01:37:47,680
It was just there to sell the game.

1469
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:53,140
I don't know where to go now.

1470
01:37:54,700 --> 01:37:55,800
I'm so lost.

1471
01:37:56,660 --> 01:37:58,320
Oh my god, I'm so lost.

1472
01:37:58,420 --> 01:37:59,680
Where the fuck am I?

1473
01:38:03,560 --> 01:38:04,620
Oh my god.

1474
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:08,100
What's the library that we're waiting for?

1475
01:38:08,180 --> 01:38:09,400
Oh my god, it's warp tab.

1476
01:38:13,850 --> 01:38:14,170
Alright.

1477
01:38:14,610 --> 01:38:15,050
Don't worry.

1478
01:38:15,290 --> 01:38:16,310
It's warping tab.

1479
01:38:16,470 --> 01:38:17,170
Where the fuck is the warp?

1480
01:38:19,730 --> 01:38:20,410
There you go.

1481
01:38:21,290 --> 01:38:21,670
Okay.

1482
01:38:22,750 --> 01:38:23,750
Mystic matter.

1483
01:38:27,550 --> 01:38:29,110
Where am I?

1484
01:38:33,030 --> 01:38:33,610
Here?

1485
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:40,240
Is this the library?

1486
01:38:41,300 --> 01:38:41,920
Where is this?

1487
01:38:42,340 --> 01:38:42,860
Oh, it is.

1488
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:43,520
Okay, okay.

1489
01:38:43,940 --> 01:38:45,250
Back to the library and go.

1490
01:38:46,980 --> 01:38:49,420
It's time to split up and look for clues, gang.

1491
01:38:51,700 --> 01:38:53,200
This is not a map.

1492
01:38:53,700 --> 01:38:54,920
It is not a map.

1493
01:38:55,120 --> 01:38:58,100
I'm like, where am I looking at?

1494
01:39:02,330 --> 01:39:02,910
Okay, back.

1495
01:39:03,570 --> 01:39:04,370
Oh, bye.

1496
01:39:06,930 --> 01:39:08,970
Yeah, no, the Spyder Trilogy was remade.

1497
01:39:12,460 --> 01:39:19,560

Enter the dragonfly.

1508
01:39:52,240 --> 01:39:52,560
Buff.

1509
01:39:52,900 --> 01:39:53,400
Scooby.

1510
01:39:54,620 --> 01:39:56,560
Buff Sparks won't hurt you.

1511
01:39:59,780 --> 01:40:01,860
Buff Sparks can't hurt you.

1512
01:40:02,740 --> 01:40:03,900
He wasn't real.

1513
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:07,080
Voice by what's his name?

1514
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:08,240
The Lord of the Rings guy.

1515
01:40:08,440 --> 01:40:09,820
The Lord of the Rings hobbit too.

1516
01:40:09,820 --> 01:40:09,940
Oh.

1517
01:40:10,580 --> 01:40:14,220
For those of you don't know, I think it was Spiral 4.

1518
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:16,860
They made Sparks buff as fuck.

1519
01:40:17,080 --> 01:40:20,060
And then they got Elijah Wood.

1520
01:40:20,860 --> 01:40:22,960
They got Elijah Wood.

1521
01:40:23,860 --> 01:40:25,480
And David Spade as Spark.

1522
01:40:25,620 --> 01:40:28,520
Yeah, Elijah Wood was like Spiral.

1523
01:40:29,120 --> 01:40:31,740
And then David Spade was Spark.

1524
01:40:33,900 --> 01:40:35,300
How the fuck do I...

1525
01:40:35,300 --> 01:40:35,860
Oh, there you go.

1526
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:36,580
It was bugged.

1527
01:40:36,900 --> 01:40:37,200
Okay.

1528
01:40:38,260 --> 01:40:39,840
I was like, how do I get over there?

1529
01:40:48,850 --> 01:40:50,150
Yeah, but he's so far.

1530
01:40:50,330 --> 01:40:52,070
He's not even close to me.

1531
01:40:53,970 --> 01:40:55,890
Are you fucking kidding me?

1532
01:40:58,650 --> 01:40:58,930
Okay.

1533
01:40:59,630 --> 01:41:00,530
That's fine.

1534
01:41:03,070 --> 01:41:04,230
Where the fuck did that open?

1535
01:41:05,230 --> 01:41:06,190
Oh, it's over here.

1536
01:41:07,730 --> 01:41:10,370
Okay, I don't think I need to grab more Scooby Snacks.

1537
01:41:10,470 --> 01:41:12,970
Like, I think I'm stacked right now in Scooby Snacks.

1538
01:41:15,790 --> 01:41:16,590
Go away.

1539
01:41:17,150 --> 01:41:18,110
Where do I go?

1540
01:41:18,950 --> 01:41:20,470
I guess I'll try here first.

1541
01:41:21,970 --> 01:41:22,970
Cosmo, thank you for the super chat.

1542
01:41:23,170 --> 01:41:24,050
Thank you, thank you.

1543
01:41:25,550 --> 01:41:25,950
Creepers.

1544
01:41:26,290 --> 01:41:27,470
There's no creepers.

1545
01:41:30,130 --> 01:41:30,690
Oh my god.

1546
01:41:30,790 --> 01:41:33,970
There's so many backtracks, so I don't know which backtrack
I should backtrack.

1547
01:41:35,970 --> 01:41:39,630
Yeah, this mansion looks a lot bigger than in the inside
than the outside.

1548
01:41:41,190 --> 01:41:43,730
I don't know if you guys saw what the outside looked like.

1549
01:41:46,150 --> 01:41:48,430
Wait, there's a fucking Twinkie right here.

1550
01:41:49,210 --> 01:41:50,130
Oh, it's the Bubba.

1551
01:41:50,470 --> 01:41:51,010
It's the soap.

1552
01:41:54,290 --> 01:41:55,170
Okay, I can't...

1553
01:41:55,170 --> 01:41:56,410
Wait, maybe I can glitch it?

1554
01:41:56,950 --> 01:41:57,850
Nah, I can't.

1555
01:41:59,210 --> 01:42:00,330
I was going the right way.

1556
01:42:00,430 --> 01:42:01,530
Okay, that's good to know.

1557
01:42:02,710 --> 01:42:06,090
Crazy part is I have not fought my first boss yet.

1558
01:42:08,850 --> 01:42:10,370
That's the crazy part.

1559
01:42:11,210 --> 01:42:15,590
There's like bosses there, and I have yet to encounter my
first boss.

1560
01:42:16,770 --> 01:42:26,970

Yeah, I'll go this way.

1569
01:42:57,900 --> 01:43:00,600
I want to make sure there's nothing else that I forgot.

Oh yeah, that's just a short oh my god, I just went the long
way to get to Shaggy.

1572
01:43:12,580 --> 01:43:15,500
Yeah, games back then love fixed camera angles.

1573
01:43:16,660 --> 01:43:17,220

1574
01:43:18,700 --> 01:43:19,220

01:43:21,260 --> 01:43:21,780
Equality!

1577
01:43:23,120 --> 01:43:24,100
Get yourself.

1578
01:43:24,680 --> 01:43:26,540
Get yourself a guy like Shaggy.

1579
01:43:28,760 --> 01:43:29,460
He cares.

1580
01:43:29,620 --> 01:43:31,020
He cares about equality.

1581
01:43:33,100 --> 01:43:33,780
What the fuck?

1582
01:43:35,320 --> 01:43:38,080
Oh, he'll push the button.

1583
01:43:42,390 --> 01:43:43,930
Alright, stand over here.

1584
01:43:44,350 --> 01:43:46,130
Shaggy, I need you to stand over here.

1585
01:43:46,390 --> 01:43:47,130
Okay, never mind.

1586
01:43:47,250 --> 01:43:48,270
Oh, is he gonna chuck me?

1587
01:43:48,790 --> 01:43:49,450
Alright, there you go.

1588
01:43:50,650 --> 01:43:51,010
Yay!

1589
01:43:52,810 --> 01:43:54,050
Alright, then we leave him.

1590
01:43:54,130 --> 01:43:56,550
Looks like I'll be cooling my heels around here.

1591
01:43:56,750 --> 01:43:57,350
See you, pal.

1592
01:43:59,630 --> 01:44:03,650
Yeah, guess you're yourself a boy who can princess carry you
and you can princess carry him.

01:44:11,690 --> 01:44:12,170
Oh.

1595
01:44:15,670 --> 01:44:16,790
Yeah, I think he's dead.

1596
01:44:18,290 --> 01:44:18,550
Okay.

1597
01:44:19,710 --> 01:44:20,750
Now where do I go?

1598
01:44:20,830 --> 01:44:22,210
He took my own new platform.

1599
01:44:23,510 --> 01:44:24,110
Oh, I know.

1600
01:44:24,930 --> 01:44:25,670
My enemy.

1601
01:44:26,610 --> 01:44:27,290
Death perception.

1602
01:44:28,490 --> 01:44:29,510
Okay, we got this.

1603
01:44:31,110 --> 01:44:31,770
Oh, no.

1604
01:44:33,630 --> 01:44:33,970
Okay.

1605
01:44:34,750 --> 01:44:35,290
It's okay.

1606
01:44:36,270 --> 01:44:37,330
We can make this jump.

1607
01:44:38,530 --> 01:44:39,350
Oh, my God.

1608
01:44:39,450 --> 01:44:39,670
It's okay.

1609
01:44:39,730 --> 01:44:39,930
It's okay.

1610
01:44:39,970 --> 01:44:40,410
We made the jump.

1611
01:44:40,470 --> 01:44:40,930
We made the jump.

1612
01:44:41,050 --> 01:44:41,630
That's all that matters.

1613
01:44:41,870 --> 01:44:42,450
We made the jump.

1614
01:44:42,590 --> 01:44:43,090
I don't...

1615
01:44:43,090 --> 01:44:43,610
Where do I go?

1616
01:44:43,970 --> 01:44:44,350
We made...

1617
01:44:46,330 --> 01:44:47,350
We got to go right.

1618
01:44:50,710 --> 01:44:51,350
There you go.

1619
01:44:54,190 --> 01:44:54,850
Here we go.

1620
01:44:55,030 --> 01:44:55,950
Uh, this way.

01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:04,880
They did like additions to it.

1627
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:08,240
What the fuck?

1628
01:46:09,740 --> 01:46:11,300
Where am I?

1629
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:16,040
That is definitely a grower, not a shower.

1630
01:46:19,400 --> 01:46:21,100
Wait, is that a bad guy?

1631
01:46:21,200 --> 01:46:22,640
Oh my god, it's a gargoyle.

1632
01:46:23,720 --> 01:46:24,460
Oh my god.

1633
01:46:24,580 --> 01:46:24,740
Okay.

1634
01:46:25,100 --> 01:46:27,020
I definitely don't remember the gargoyle.

1635
01:46:28,040 --> 01:46:28,860
Oh, I died.

1636
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:29,880
I'm dead.

1637
01:46:33,220 --> 01:46:33,660
Oh no.

1638
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:36,100
Where did I go?

1639
01:46:37,860 --> 01:46:41,840
I still have to go right because that's where the fucking
helmet was.

1640
01:46:42,940 --> 01:46:45,880
Oh my god, but how do I get to the right side?

1641
01:46:53,480 --> 01:46:54,280
This way.

1642
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:57,400
Okay, I think I fucked up my jump earlier.

1643
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:02,920

1644
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:16,920

No, no, no!

1649
01:47:32,100 --> 01:47:32,360
No!

1650
01:47:35,660 --> 01:47:36,380
It's okay.

1651
01:47:36,820 --> 01:47:37,960
I can do this again.

1652
01:47:38,040 --> 01:47:38,920
I figured it out.

1653
01:47:40,940 --> 01:47:41,000
All right.

1654
01:47:41,180 --> 01:47:42,060
I achieved the system.

1655
01:47:42,260 --> 01:47:43,120
I found a shortcut.

1656
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:46,960
I'm running.

1657
01:47:47,660 --> 01:47:47,860
I'm running.

1658
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:48,360
I'm running.

1659
01:47:48,360 --> 01:47:49,320
And I drop down from here.

1660
01:47:49,480 --> 01:47:50,600
And then there's the gargoyle.

1661
01:47:52,720 --> 01:47:53,560
Oh my god.

1662
01:47:53,680 --> 01:47:53,880
This is...

1663
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:55,460
This part just freaks me up.

1664
01:47:55,760 --> 01:47:56,360
Where am I?

1665
01:47:56,680 --> 01:47:56,800
Oh!

1666
01:47:57,680 --> 01:47:58,860
I don't understand!

1667
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:00,560
I'm hitting straight!

1668
01:48:06,140 --> 01:48:07,100
This time.

1669
01:48:09,960 --> 01:48:11,460
Okay, we drop down.

1670
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:13,740
And then there's the rock row.

1671
01:48:13,940 --> 01:48:14,900
It's a gargoyle.

1672
01:48:17,120 --> 01:48:19,640
Am I, every time I feel like I wasn't, I'm not gonna hit it.

1673
01:48:20,100 --> 01:48:22,660
Oh my god, I keep freaking out because I keep thinking I'm
not.

1674
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:29,110
I keep thinking I'm not gonna hit it.

1675
01:48:29,430 --> 01:48:31,050
So I keep jumping back.

1676
01:48:31,210 --> 01:48:32,330
I'm freaking out.

1677
01:48:38,550 --> 01:48:39,290
Okay, the set.

1678
01:48:43,720 --> 01:48:46,620
Okay, I'm not risking it.

1679
01:48:46,900 --> 01:48:47,940
I'm not risking it.

1680
01:48:48,100 --> 01:48:48,980
I just went for it.

1681
01:48:51,480 --> 01:48:52,880
Okay, there is a door.

1682
01:48:53,020 --> 01:48:55,240
But I feel like I can...

1683
01:48:55,240 --> 01:49:00,060
Okay, I feel like the magic carpet's gonna take me all the
way to the top, baby.

1684
01:49:00,440 --> 01:49:00,900
Right.

1685
01:49:02,860 --> 01:49:05,120
Guys, where is the magic carpet taking me?

1686
01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:06,500
This is not up.

1687
01:49:09,100 --> 01:49:12,940
Okay, guys, the magic carpet is not taking me all the way to
the top, baby.

1688
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:15,900
It's taking me all the way to the bottom.

1689
01:49:17,740 --> 01:49:18,580
Okay, it's this way.

1690
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:26,940
I can't believe they renovated, added, expanded the house
while I've been trapped in the fucking mansion.

1691
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:32,840
They added like 10 more floors and 10 more.

1692
01:49:32,860 --> 01:49:35,380
like 50 more rooms.

1693
01:49:38,080 --> 01:49:41,340
Like, have I been trapped in this manner for 20 years?

1694
01:49:42,840 --> 01:49:44,360
Like, what the fuck happened?

1695
01:49:51,790 --> 01:49:53,250
Alright, this way.

1696
01:49:54,630 --> 01:49:56,590
Constructions will continue.

1697
01:49:59,410 --> 01:50:02,870
It doesn't matter if this- Are you fucking kidding me?

1698
01:50:02,950 --> 01:50:04,170
It's edgeguarding me!

1699
01:50:10,120 --> 01:50:10,920
All right.

1700
01:50:14,200 --> 01:50:14,420
That's okay.

1701
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:15,860
I made it across.

1702
01:50:19,560 --> 01:50:20,460
There we go.

1703
01:50:21,320 --> 01:50:22,540
This guy plays Smash.

1704
01:50:27,450 --> 01:50:31,250
Yeah, the moment you enter the manor, you're in like this
hyperbolic time chamber.

1705
01:50:31,630 --> 01:50:33,470
Like, time literally stopped in the manor.

1706
01:50:34,470 --> 01:50:36,010
It's like, it's like...

1707
01:50:36,010 --> 01:50:38,930
It's been 20 years.

1708
01:50:39,510 --> 01:50:40,730
We've been waiting for you.

1709
01:50:42,170 --> 01:50:42,650
missing.

1710
01:50:49,530 --> 01:50:50,750
Where's the last key?

1711
01:50:51,710 --> 01:50:52,470
What the fuck?

1712
01:50:52,550 --> 01:50:53,550
I'm missing a key.

1713
01:50:54,650 --> 01:50:56,290
That got all four keys?

1714
01:50:58,010 --> 01:51:00,450
You have been trapped here since you were a kid.

1715
01:51:01,050 --> 01:51:01,470
I did?

1716
01:51:01,590 --> 01:51:01,890
Okay.

1717
01:51:02,310 --> 01:51:02,790
I didn't realize.

1718
01:51:02,850 --> 01:51:04,490
I thought I had I was missing a key.

1719
01:51:09,220 --> 01:51:10,180
Oh, there was only three.

1720
01:51:10,360 --> 01:51:10,500
Sorry.

1721
01:51:11,080 --> 01:51:12,900
Apparently I'm really bad at counting too.

1722
01:51:13,420 --> 01:51:15,640
Guys, I'm just role playing as kid dokey guys.

1723
01:51:15,820 --> 01:51:16,680
I knew that.

1724
01:51:16,780 --> 01:51:17,840
I knew there was three.

1725
01:51:25,330 --> 01:51:26,170
That's crazy.

1726
01:51:26,310 --> 01:51:27,290
I'm at 30%.

1727
01:51:27,290 --> 01:51:29,210
I've yet to encounter a single boss.

1728
01:51:31,490 --> 01:51:33,070
Okay, does he... Does that kill him?

1729
01:51:33,150 --> 01:51:33,350
No.

1730
01:51:33,610 --> 01:51:34,210
Oh, it does.

1731
01:51:34,410 --> 01:51:34,590
Okay.

1732
01:51:36,370 --> 01:51:36,890
Yeah.

1733
01:51:37,990 --> 01:51:39,770
Scooby has committed another murder.

1734
01:51:43,990 --> 01:51:47,750
Yeah, so like... You're supposed to be saving the rest of
the Scooby gang?

1735
01:51:48,170 --> 01:51:52,050
I've yet to encounter anyone from the Scooby gang other than
Shaggy.

1736
01:51:52,710 --> 01:51:53,230
Okay.

1737
01:51:58,050 --> 01:52:01,090
Oh my god, there was a carpet the entire time.

1738
01:52:05,510 --> 01:52:07,050
Yeah, I need one of the inventions.

1739
01:52:07,250 --> 01:52:08,210
I'm missing one of them.

1740
01:52:08,690 --> 01:52:09,990
Oh my god, are you fucking...

1741
01:52:10,630 --> 01:52:12,070
God damn fat!

1742
01:52:16,310 --> 01:52:17,690
Oh my god.

1743
01:52:18,570 --> 01:52:24,010
Mystery Gan's parents have been trying to find their missing
teenagers for like 30 years and they were going to give up.

1744
01:52:24,310 --> 01:52:26,990
No, they didn't know they've been trapped in this goddamn
haunted mansion.

1745
01:52:28,850 --> 01:52:30,490
Where time does not exist here.

1746
01:52:33,250 --> 01:52:35,370
All right, one HP and I dream.

1747
01:52:37,270 --> 01:52:38,850
Are you okay?

1748
01:52:39,870 --> 01:52:40,730
It's fine.

1749
01:52:40,910 --> 01:52:43,950
There's a cake down here that I can't get.

1750
01:52:46,310 --> 01:52:47,450
That's here to obey me.

1751
01:52:47,570 --> 01:52:49,050
And they're like, ooh, this is something.

1752
01:52:49,270 --> 01:52:51,530
You really want that cake right now.

1753
01:52:54,470 --> 01:52:55,210
Mysterio Inc.

1754
01:52:55,690 --> 01:52:57,090
vanished 30 years ago.

1755
01:52:58,410 --> 01:53:00,750
It was the last place that people saw them.

1756
01:53:02,570 --> 01:53:04,350
Look this, wait, I can grab a set.

1757
01:53:04,730 --> 01:53:05,130
There we go.

1758
01:53:06,250 --> 01:53:07,330
See, I don't need no umbrella.

1759
01:53:09,450 --> 01:53:11,590
If only there was a responsible adult.

1760
01:53:14,210 --> 01:53:17,730
If only, if only there was a responsible adult to supervise.

1761
01:53:22,370 --> 01:53:22,730
Okay.

1762
01:53:25,170 --> 01:53:25,890
Magic carpet.

1763
01:53:33,690 --> 01:53:34,050
Alright.

1764
01:53:35,150 --> 01:53:36,210
Maybe he has a cake to- nope.

1765
01:53:36,570 --> 01:53:37,710
He has no food in him.

1766
01:53:38,290 --> 01:53:39,170
Oh, oh, God.

1767
01:53:39,370 --> 01:53:40,990
There's the flaming chandelier.

1768
01:53:42,630 --> 01:53:44,050
Anything over here?

1769
01:53:45,790 --> 01:53:47,990
Landing is covered with sticky tar scoop.

1770
01:53:48,250 --> 01:53:50,410
I'll let you move freely with the sticky tar.

1771
01:53:51,130 --> 01:53:52,250
All right, not this one.

1772
01:53:52,710 --> 01:53:53,450
I'll get boots.

1773
01:53:53,970 --> 01:53:56,330
I think the invention was literally boots or some shit.

1774
01:53:57,010 --> 01:53:58,090
Like, wow, congratulations.

1775
01:53:58,470 --> 01:53:59,910
You invented dog boots.

1776
01:54:02,350 --> 01:54:04,250
A revelation of your times.

1777
01:54:05,250 --> 01:54:08,270
Modern out- modern Thomas Edison right here.

1778
01:54:09,750 --> 01:54:12,030
Oh, no, no, no!

1779
01:54:16,570 --> 01:54:18,370
Okay, at least I got the Scooby Snacks, though.

1780
01:54:22,370 --> 01:54:23,510
Let's just take me.

1781
01:54:27,270 --> 01:54:28,410
Panic in the attic.

1782
01:54:30,130 --> 01:54:31,030
Where am I now?

1783
01:54:31,770 --> 01:54:33,050
Where am I?

1784
01:54:33,610 --> 01:54:36,090
How many attics are there?

1785
01:54:36,930 --> 01:54:37,350
Yeah.

1786
01:54:38,430 --> 01:54:39,150
Okay.

1787
01:54:40,510 --> 01:54:42,380
I feel like I've been...

1788
01:54:43,130 --> 01:54:46,570
I've been stuck in this attic for 50 years!

1789
01:54:48,370 --> 01:54:52,010
Who needs to sneak sneak when I can just beat them up?

1790
01:54:54,330 --> 01:54:56,150
Okay, and I actually needed that too.

1791
01:54:58,370 --> 01:55:00,550
Night of a hundred addicts!

1792
01:55:00,550 --> 01:55:01,830
I feel like I might as well.

1793
01:55:02,670 --> 01:55:03,570
It really is.

1794
01:55:06,150 --> 01:55:07,730
Way too many.

1795
01:55:11,890 --> 01:55:12,970
Okay, there should be a key here.

1796
01:55:14,210 --> 01:55:14,810
Key get.

1797
01:55:18,630 --> 01:55:19,070
See?

1798
01:55:19,430 --> 01:55:20,530
Who needs sneaking?

1799
01:55:21,770 --> 01:55:23,230
Well, I could just bash these people.

1800
01:55:24,250 --> 01:55:25,370
Bash them in.

1801
01:55:26,170 --> 01:55:26,550
Boop.

1802
01:55:27,990 --> 01:55:28,750
It's okay.

1803
01:55:28,850 --> 01:55:29,410
I'm a dog.

1804
01:55:29,630 --> 01:55:31,110
I don't know what's right or wrong.

1805
01:55:33,410 --> 01:55:35,170
But I did it, guys.

1806
01:55:37,430 --> 01:55:39,070
Look, it's not my fault.

1807
01:55:39,550 --> 01:55:41,330
My owners taught me this.

1808
01:55:42,970 --> 01:55:43,530
Okay.

1809
01:55:44,050 --> 01:55:47,750
All 100 fights are just every door that leads back to the
attic.

1810
01:55:51,150 --> 01:55:54,370
Yeah, yeah, who needs self when you have blood force trauma?

1811
01:55:54,530 --> 01:55:54,850
Exactly.

1812
01:55:56,050 --> 01:55:57,370
Okay, okay, I should just stun him.

1813
01:55:57,470 --> 01:56:02,730
Okay, we leave, we leave, we leave, we leave, we leave, we
leave, we leave, we leave.

1814
01:56:04,190 --> 01:56:06,930
Sure, there's nothing inside that fucking box, too, right?

1815
01:56:07,650 --> 01:56:08,690
Yeah, see, look at that.

1816
01:56:08,730 --> 01:56:09,470
That was just bait.

1817
01:56:15,280 --> 01:56:16,540
Is that all the keys?

1818
01:56:17,700 --> 01:56:21,220
Wait, but what's over there?

1819
01:56:21,720 --> 01:56:23,580
What's on the other side of that area?

1820
01:56:24,620 --> 01:56:25,360
What the...

1821
01:56:25,360 --> 01:56:26,620
Okay, we're going this way.

1822
01:56:26,980 --> 01:56:27,500
That's...

1823
01:56:27,500 --> 01:56:30,160
That looks a little too fucked up.

1824
01:56:32,980 --> 01:56:35,080
What if the devs were adding it to Expedia?

1825
01:56:35,220 --> 01:56:37,700
Thank you for the super chat thinking, thank you.

1826
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:38,860
It's like he doesn't know.

1827
01:56:40,900 --> 01:56:41,920
And he doesn't know.

1828
01:56:44,780 --> 01:56:45,800
Why can you stun him?

1829
01:56:47,920 --> 01:56:48,300
Yay!

1830
01:56:52,120 --> 01:56:53,640
Oh my god, was that it?

1831
01:56:55,020 --> 01:56:56,900
Is there anything else up top?

1832
01:56:59,860 --> 01:57:01,420
Oh my god, there's a Scooby Snack.

1833
01:57:03,400 --> 01:57:04,380
Okay, that was it.

1834
01:57:04,820 --> 01:57:05,560
It's literally just food.

1835
01:57:05,740 --> 01:57:07,440
Oh fuck, okay, it's okay, I didn't get hit.

1836
01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:10,240
Oh my god, where am I supposed to go?

1837
01:57:11,460 --> 01:57:12,820
Oh, thank god, another warp.

This way.

1850
01:58:37,340 --> 01:58:38,000
Where?

1851
01:58:39,100 --> 01:58:40,620

Oh, there we go.

You have to go up here.

1855
01:58:49,320 --> 01:58:50,440
I'll wait for the carpet.

1856
01:58:52,340 --> 01:58:53,660
Any minute now.

1857
01:58:55,600 --> 01:58:56,720
Any minute.

1859
01:58:59,480 --> 01:59:01,520

Oh my god, thank god.

1861
01:59:05,700 --> 01:59:06,340
Okay, I did it.

1862
01:59:07,660 --> 01:59:08,060
Clutch.

1863
01:59:09,340 --> 01:59:10,700
I made it to the other side.

1864
01:59:15,400 --> 01:59:15,920
Nice.

1865
01:59:16,320 --> 01:59:17,820
Dark and storm united.

1866
01:59:18,900 --> 01:59:20,620
At least it's not the attic this time.

1867
01:59:21,940 --> 01:59:23,240
Get away from him!

1868
01:59:24,240 --> 01:59:25,580
Alright, Shaggy, you're saying it.

1869
01:59:25,600 --> 01:59:26,260
I'm a hero.

1870
01:59:28,340 --> 01:59:30,400
Save your progress and get a chance battle.

1871
01:59:31,400 --> 01:59:32,620
I saved him.

1872
01:59:33,080 --> 01:59:33,840
I'm gonna hear...

1873
01:59:33,840 --> 01:59:34,100
Oh my god.

1874
01:59:34,200 --> 01:59:35,900
I'm gonna get so many Scooby Snacks for that.

1875
01:59:36,740 --> 01:59:39,840
I'm gonna restore my fucking Scooby Snack economy.

1876
01:59:40,480 --> 01:59:41,700
I don't have an umbrella.

1877
01:59:41,880 --> 01:59:42,540
What the fuck?

1878
01:59:42,720 --> 01:59:43,500
Oh my god.

1879
01:59:44,860 --> 01:59:45,880
Why am I here?

1880
01:59:46,260 --> 01:59:48,460
Now I know I find the umbrella.

1881
01:59:49,040 --> 01:59:53,000
Where's the closest 7-Eleven that's gonna upcharge me a $20
umbrella?

1882
01:59:55,640 --> 01:59:56,200
Wait.

1883
01:59:56,200 --> 01:59:57,380
Is he gonna... Can he throw me?

1884
01:59:57,560 --> 01:59:58,820
He can't even throw me!

1885
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:00,660
But I'm going back.

1886
02:00:00,780 --> 02:00:01,600
Maybe he can throw me.

1887
02:00:03,780 --> 02:00:07,720
Where is my 7-Eleven to sell me a $20 umbrella when it's
raining?

1888
02:00:08,700 --> 02:00:11,100
Yeah, I was gonna say, was he gonna throw me?

1889
02:00:12,260 --> 02:00:13,420
He just said hi.

1890
02:00:15,600 --> 02:00:16,280
Oh, there we go.

1891
02:00:16,340 --> 02:00:17,020
Okay, thank God.

1892
02:00:20,080 --> 02:00:20,800
Okay, this way.

1893
02:00:23,820 --> 02:00:25,540
Okay, I need you to throw me a bit better, Shaggy.

1894
02:00:26,540 --> 02:00:27,660
There you go.

1895
02:00:28,720 --> 02:00:29,710
You have to go up to him.

1896
02:00:34,170 --> 02:00:34,750
This way.

1897
02:00:36,470 --> 02:00:37,310
God damn it.

1898
02:00:37,410 --> 02:00:38,050
Okay, I'm fine.

1899
02:00:38,990 --> 02:00:41,090
I actually need the Scooby Snacks.

1900
02:00:41,910 --> 02:00:43,700
The economy's been pretty rough on me.

1901
02:00:48,090 --> 02:00:48,750
This way.

1902
02:00:49,630 --> 02:00:54,830
Ever since the Scooby Snack market crashed, it hasn't been
the same for Scoobs.

1903
02:00:56,890 --> 02:00:56,970
Oh.

1904
02:00:57,630 --> 02:00:58,170
No.

1905
02:00:58,790 --> 02:01:04,230
No, please don't tell me God damn it It's all the way and he
came back

1906
02:01:08,270 --> 02:01:13,970
All right The fact that he came back

1907
02:01:17,750 --> 02:01:30,520
Okay I go this way This is fine I'm confused there because I
thought

1908
02:01:35,410 --> 02:01:39,930
No It's the same place.

1909
02:01:40,110 --> 02:01:43,110
I didn't realize it was the same place.

1910
02:01:44,290 --> 02:01:45,350
Okay, there you go.

1911
02:01:45,670 --> 02:01:46,450
Let's try this again.

1912
02:01:46,650 --> 02:01:47,730
Let's try this again.

1913
02:01:48,010 --> 02:01:48,910
Let's try this again.

1914
02:01:52,690 --> 02:01:54,070
Okay, here we go again.

1915
02:01:55,310 --> 02:01:57,490
I thought Dino was a different place!

1916
02:01:58,230 --> 02:02:00,910
I didn't realize it was the same area!

1917
02:02:02,390 --> 02:02:02,910
Right?

1918
02:02:03,950 --> 02:02:04,390
Right?

1919
02:02:04,790 --> 02:02:06,510
Okay, okay, okay, we made it.

1920
02:02:08,050 --> 02:02:09,630
Okay, we can wait.

1921
02:02:10,570 --> 02:02:11,370
Does it go down?

1922
02:02:11,750 --> 02:02:12,030
Do I?

1923
02:02:13,710 --> 02:02:14,190
Hello?

1924
02:02:16,530 --> 02:02:17,470
How the fuck?

1925
02:02:17,850 --> 02:02:18,310
How?

1926
02:02:24,700 --> 02:02:26,420
What the fuck do I do?

1927
02:02:30,230 --> 02:02:31,790
First flame chimney?

1928
02:02:33,070 --> 02:02:33,490
Okay.

1929
02:02:33,830 --> 02:02:34,930
Yeah, it's raining.

1930
02:02:43,190 --> 02:02:45,190
There's a button I have to press.

1931
02:02:45,310 --> 02:02:46,570
Where the fuck is this button?

1932
02:02:46,690 --> 02:02:47,530
Oh my god.

1933
02:02:47,850 --> 02:02:49,910
Oh my fucking god.

1934
02:02:49,930 --> 02:02:51,550
Oh, goodbye, Shaggy.

1935
02:02:52,930 --> 02:02:54,430
Oh my god, they kidnapped him.

1936
02:02:55,330 --> 02:02:56,830
He'll be fine, right, guys?

1937
02:02:58,110 --> 02:02:58,590
Oh.

1938
02:03:00,030 --> 02:03:02,190
Okay, isn't that, like, one of the fire?

1939
02:03:03,770 --> 02:03:05,950
Guys, Shaggy's gonna be fine, right?

1940
02:03:07,530 --> 02:03:10,270
Gravity doesn't exist in the Scooby universe, right?

1941
02:03:10,450 --> 02:03:10,990
Guys, it's okay.

1942
02:03:12,050 --> 02:03:12,650
Oh, wait, see?

1943
02:03:12,730 --> 02:03:13,450
I told you.

1944
02:03:13,610 --> 02:03:14,090
Boing.

1945
02:03:16,850 --> 02:03:17,730
Guys, I told you.

1946
02:03:20,810 --> 02:03:23,530
Gravity ain't real in the Scooby-Doo universe.

1947
02:03:24,010 --> 02:03:26,670
Isaac Newton didn't discover it yet.

1948
02:03:30,370 --> 02:03:31,130
Get out.

1949
02:03:31,930 --> 02:03:33,530
I breathe so fucking high.

1950
02:03:39,510 --> 02:03:40,430
It's okay.

1951
02:03:41,010 --> 02:03:43,290
Isaac Newton isn't real in the Scooby-Doo universe.

1952
02:03:44,410 --> 02:03:45,550
He's too powerful.

1953
02:03:45,690 --> 02:03:46,030
I know.

1954
02:03:54,500 --> 02:03:56,020

1960
02:05:02,660 --> 02:05:04,000
How did you get trapped by him?

1961
02:05:04,740 --> 02:05:08,400
You remember the black night.

1962
02:05:10,720 --> 02:05:11,780
I remember.

1963
02:05:18,080 --> 02:05:19,580
Wait, how did you do that?

1964
02:05:20,380 --> 02:05:24,020
I thought you said magic and real, mama.

1965
02:05:26,780 --> 02:05:29,380
What else are you lying to me about?

1966
02:05:32,400 --> 02:05:37,580
Oh my god, back when Tim Curry actually did like video game
voiceovers.

1967
02:05:38,440 --> 02:05:39,180
Wait, is that?

1968
02:05:40,080 --> 02:05:40,340
Right?

1969
02:05:41,140 --> 02:05:42,160
I don't want to do this.

1970
02:05:45,160 --> 02:05:45,520
Oh!

1971
02:05:48,280 --> 02:05:49,620
I understand.

1972
02:05:54,950 --> 02:05:55,370
What?

1973
02:05:56,550 --> 02:05:57,970
Guys, I don't understand.

1974
02:06:12,440 --> 02:06:13,860
What do I do?

1975
02:06:21,740 --> 02:06:23,100
Do I wait for you?

1976
02:06:23,280 --> 02:06:24,420
Come on, get over here.

1977
02:06:24,780 --> 02:06:25,420
Look closer.

1978
02:06:25,600 --> 02:06:27,000
Wait, why are you walking away?

1979
02:06:27,860 --> 02:06:28,360
Hey, bro.

1980
02:06:32,040 --> 02:06:33,640
Yeah, he got their scent!

1981
02:06:33,960 --> 02:06:34,260
Okay, okay.

1982
02:06:36,240 --> 02:06:37,600
Okay, okay, it's right.

1983
02:06:37,800 --> 02:06:38,980
Yeah, yeah, I get it now.

1984
02:06:39,820 --> 02:06:41,480
It's like this game is made for babies.

1985
02:06:41,860 --> 02:06:42,740
What are you gonna do with that?

1986
02:06:42,880 --> 02:06:43,600
Okay, it hit me.

1987
02:06:43,720 --> 02:06:46,680
Okay, that's, that's like, that's fucked up.

1988
02:06:48,560 --> 02:06:51,280
This did not look like it was gonna hit me, guys.

1989
02:06:51,680 --> 02:06:52,720
That axe did not.

1990
02:06:52,960 --> 02:06:55,560
Oh, and it conducts electricity too.

1991
02:06:58,720 --> 02:07:00,660
Oh my god, this is bullshit.

1992
02:07:02,540 --> 02:07:04,680
How the fuck am I supposed to- Okay.

1993
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:08,460
Bro, this guy is just walking back- Okay, this is fine.

Bada, bada, bada, bada, no.

02:09:42,480 --> 02:09:44,920
Thank God the evils defeated.

Okay.

2029
02:10:02,660 --> 02:10:04,640
Something fishy is going on here, Scooby.

2030
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,680
We solved the mystery of the Black Knight ages ago.

2031
02:10:07,860 --> 02:10:08,200
Yeah.

2032
02:10:09,900 --> 02:10:11,180
I don't know.

02:10:11,240 --> 02:10:13,380
I've been trapped in the attic for 20 years.

2034
02:10:13,940 --> 02:10:15,260
A spooky groundskeeper?

2035
02:10:15,960 --> 02:10:18,500
Yeah, and ghosts and monsters?

2036
02:10:19,600 --> 02:10:23,620
Scooby-Doo, you know there's no such thing as monsters and
ghosts.

2037
02:10:24,320 --> 02:10:25,940
We both saw the ghost!

2038
02:10:26,960 --> 02:10:30,400
I thought he was a monster, but really he was just a guy in
a mask.

2039
02:10:31,020 --> 02:10:31,320
Aha!

2040
02:10:31,620 --> 02:10:32,480
I found him!

2041
02:10:33,100 --> 02:10:33,680
Jinkies!

2042
02:10:33,720 --> 02:10:36,660
Bro, he's literally controlling the weather, Velma!

2043
02:10:39,340 --> 02:10:40,280
Thanks, Scooby.

2044
02:10:40,660 --> 02:10:42,600
I can't see a thing without these.

2045
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:44,200
Janky, Scooby.

2046
02:10:44,600 --> 02:10:45,620
It's the creeper.

2047
02:10:45,660 --> 02:10:47,200
The creeper?

2048
02:10:47,480 --> 02:10:47,860
Where?

2049
02:10:49,500 --> 02:10:50,860
He's everywhere.

2050
02:10:51,120 --> 02:10:51,440
What?

2051
02:10:51,900 --> 02:10:52,380
Run, Scooby.

2052
02:10:53,260 --> 02:10:54,560
Roma, what?

2053
02:10:54,900 --> 02:10:56,340
Roma, what's going on?

2054
02:10:57,140 --> 02:10:58,500
Yeah, I see creepers.

2055
02:10:58,840 --> 02:11:00,460
Oh my God, is it all in my mind?

2056
02:11:01,900 --> 02:11:02,700
Oh my God.

2057
02:11:02,820 --> 02:11:03,860
Planky's wife.

2058
02:11:05,480 --> 02:11:05,640
Hmm.

2059
02:11:06,420 --> 02:11:06,860
Hello.

2060
02:11:07,580 --> 02:11:09,300

02:11:09,340 --> 02:11:18,420
Graham and you found one of my amazing invention crates

automated herring scraper or my and is stick galoshes oh

2063
02:11:26,100 --> 02:11:40,300

2064
02:11:40,600 --> 02:11:41,580
A fucking genius.

2065
02:11:45,120 --> 02:11:47,100
I can't believe it.

2066
02:11:49,860 --> 02:11:50,040
The...

2067
02:11:50,040 --> 02:11:51,740
Are the smartest man alive?

2068
02:11:52,020 --> 02:11:54,460
He invented boots for dogs.

2069
02:11:58,140 --> 02:11:59,520
Uh, Warren, thank you for the super chat.

2070
02:11:59,620 --> 02:12:00,300
Thank you, thank you.

2071
02:12:00,380 --> 02:12:01,880
Top tier inventor.

2072
02:12:05,120 --> 02:12:08,220
Give him a noble peace prize right now.

2073
02:12:17,090 --> 02:12:21,730
Look, in the Scooby-Doo universe, we didn't have boots until
this guy invented them.

2074
02:12:22,770 --> 02:12:24,330
That's a genius right there.

2075
02:12:24,650 --> 02:12:28,290
Remember, currently half the minutes because they sold their
inventions and cost them and would make thousands more than

2076
02:12:28,290 --> 02:12:28,950
what they were stealing.

2077
02:12:29,150 --> 02:12:30,930
But I'd like to think it was about the message.

2078
02:12:31,270 --> 02:12:32,690
Look, that's... Where am I?

2079
02:12:34,310 --> 02:12:35,710
Where did I go?

2080
02:12:36,130 --> 02:12:37,270
What the fuck?

2081
02:12:38,030 --> 02:12:38,930
How did I go?

2082
02:12:38,930 --> 02:12:41,230
Oh my god, how did I get here?

2083
02:12:41,770 --> 02:12:42,210
How...

2084
02:12:45,510 --> 02:12:46,690
Oh, no.

2085
02:12:53,090 --> 02:12:54,630
Oh, my God.

2086
02:12:55,110 --> 02:12:56,790
I don't know how I got here.

2087
02:12:57,450 --> 02:13:00,650
No, I'm all the way down here now.

2088
02:13:01,730 --> 02:13:03,030
Oh, my God.

2089
02:13:03,210 --> 02:13:05,110
And the map doesn't tell.

2090
02:13:05,410 --> 02:13:07,630
There's a warp here, but where?

2091
02:13:11,240 --> 02:13:13,080
I don't remember.

2092
02:13:15,680 --> 02:13:17,780
How did I get here?

2093
02:13:19,600 --> 02:13:20,660
Okay, was there?

2094
02:13:20,740 --> 02:13:22,540
There was a tar thing here, right?

2095
02:13:22,760 --> 02:13:23,260
Was it here?

2096
02:13:23,420 --> 02:13:24,140
No, it wasn't.

2097
02:13:24,480 --> 02:13:26,760
I'm back in the attic again.

2098
02:13:27,380 --> 02:13:27,760
No!

2099
02:13:30,540 --> 02:13:31,060
Okay.

2100
02:13:31,900 --> 02:13:32,980
Let's go to the attic.

2101
02:13:38,070 --> 02:13:38,310
Alright.

2102
02:13:40,210 --> 02:13:42,530
All doors lead back to the attic.

2103
02:13:44,550 --> 02:13:47,830
There was a tar thing somewhere, but I don't remember where
it was.

2104
02:13:52,160 --> 02:13:53,500
Oops, all addicts.

2105
02:13:55,020 --> 02:13:59,420
I'll never escape the attic okay

2106
02:14:03,380 --> 02:14:14,460
this way all right that's fine just a spider okay that's
okay it's okay I can do this again I've done these jumps

2107
02:14:14,460 --> 02:14:33,830
before oh my god I almost did that jump too all right I'll
get rid of the spider all right We gotta figure out where

2108
02:14:33,830 --> 02:14:35,590
the fuck is the tar area.

2109
02:14:38,730 --> 02:14:40,870
Okay, I don't know.

2110
02:14:41,070 --> 02:14:41,590
Okay, that's fine.

2111
02:14:42,370 --> 02:14:43,550
I'll take it.

2112
02:14:44,270 --> 02:14:45,050
Was the tar here?

2113
02:14:46,910 --> 02:14:47,730
Oh, it was.

2114
02:14:47,910 --> 02:14:48,130
Okay.

2115
02:14:49,270 --> 02:14:50,590
That's where I went.

2116
02:14:52,770 --> 02:14:53,190
Oh!

2117
02:14:55,150 --> 02:14:56,290
All right, we leave.

2118
02:14:57,370 --> 02:14:58,110
I have to go.

2119
02:14:59,250 --> 02:15:01,310
Oh, it's... It looped back.

2120
02:15:02,170 --> 02:15:02,970
It's a loop.

2121
02:15:04,450 --> 02:15:05,370
That's how I got here.

2122
02:15:05,450 --> 02:15:06,930
Was there anything back here for Tar?

2123
02:15:07,150 --> 02:15:07,850
I don't remember.

2124
02:15:13,160 --> 02:15:14,660
I just want to double check.

2125
02:15:16,540 --> 02:15:17,540
What was this area?

2126
02:15:19,580 --> 02:15:20,000
Oh my god.

2127
02:15:20,360 --> 02:15:23,500
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, keep, let me die.

2128
02:15:26,240 --> 02:15:27,180
Okay, we go back.

2129
02:15:27,420 --> 02:15:28,160
We go back.

2130
02:15:28,500 --> 02:15:29,420
I remembered.

2131
02:15:29,720 --> 02:15:31,540
I remember what this area was.

2132
02:15:32,140 --> 02:15:32,460
All right.

2133
02:15:32,600 --> 02:15:34,940
We go back to the fishing village.

2134
02:15:35,700 --> 02:15:53,290
because I found we invented boots okay I gotta figure out
how to fucking okay all right that's the attic okay oh my

Smugglers code.

2138
02:16:19,510 --> 02:16:21,290
Because it's super secret.

2139
02:16:22,490 --> 02:16:23,910
We never figured it out.

2140
02:16:23,990 --> 02:16:25,250
Because it's very secret.

2141
02:16:25,930 --> 02:16:26,230
Alright.

2142
02:16:26,450 --> 02:16:27,530
Now that we're here.

2143
02:16:27,650 --> 02:16:29,550
We can finally make it across.

2144
02:16:30,130 --> 02:16:31,230
Oh my god.

2145
02:16:33,590 --> 02:16:35,010
Too secret for me.

2146

Alright.

2147
02:16:36,790 --> 02:16:37,870
Now we're here.

02:16:44,710 --> 02:16:45,350
Okay.

02:16:50,150 --> 02:16:50,510
Oh god.

2152
02:16:50,770 --> 02:16:51,290
What am I?

2153
02:16:51,710 --> 02:16:53,050
Oh my god.

2154
02:16:53,410 --> 02:16:53,750

2155
02:16:54,090 --> 02:16:54,370
Okay.

2156
02:16:54,830 --> 02:16:55,370
It's fine.

2157
02:16:55,790 --> 02:16:56,270
Okay.

02:16:57,150 --> 02:16:57,430
It's fine.

2160
02:16:57,510 --> 02:16:57,950
We're okay.

2161
02:16:59,490 --> 02:17:01,390
We're just fighting against the escalators.

2162
02:17:04,570 --> 02:17:05,810
Like, what is this?

2163
02:17:06,070 --> 02:17:07,490
Oh my god!

2164
02:17:07,810 --> 02:17:09,270
What is this fucking fall guy shit?

2165
02:17:09,530 --> 02:17:09,950
No!

2166
02:17:10,450 --> 02:17:11,710
I'm so close!

2167
02:17:13,570 --> 02:17:15,670
I was so close, dude.

2168
02:17:15,890 --> 02:17:17,130
I don't get out.

2169
02:17:22,650 --> 02:17:24,830
I made it so far.

2170
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:30,500
Wait, what?

2171
02:17:30,580 --> 02:17:32,060
I can't even bash this.

2172
02:17:32,160 --> 02:17:33,000
It's so slippery.

2173
02:17:33,140 --> 02:17:34,040
Okay, there you go.

2174
02:17:35,620 --> 02:17:36,260
All right, there you go.

2175
02:17:39,340 --> 02:17:40,640
Wait, why did we bash that?

2176
02:17:41,360 --> 02:17:42,220
Give me a sec.

2177
02:17:44,940 --> 02:17:45,400
Oh.

2182
02:18:29,410 --> 02:18:29,690
Okay.

2183
02:18:30,890 --> 02:18:31,410
It's fine.

2184
02:18:32,690 --> 02:18:33,970
This part is crazy.

2185
02:18:34,110 --> 02:18:35,490
This part is actually crazy.

2186
02:18:37,290 --> 02:18:40,410
Like, I think if I get hit one time, like, it's over.

2187
02:18:45,200 --> 02:18:45,860
Oh my god, please.

2188
02:18:45,940 --> 02:18:46,580
We're almost there.

2189
02:18:47,060 --> 02:18:47,740
We're almost...

2190
02:18:47,740 --> 02:18:48,020
No!

2191
02:18:52,360 --> 02:18:53,500
Like, oh, there you go.

2192
02:18:53,840 --> 02:18:54,440
There we go.

2193
02:18:54,540 --> 02:18:56,520
Please tell me it's slower.

2194
02:18:57,160 --> 02:18:59,080
Oh my god.

2195
02:19:00,260 --> 02:19:00,720
Okay.

2196
02:19:01,360 --> 02:19:03,000
I was just there.

2197
02:19:05,400 --> 02:19:06,560
Where the fuck was that?

2198
02:19:06,700 --> 02:19:08,000
What did it do?

2199
02:19:10,220 --> 02:19:12,420
How do I get out of here?

2200
02:19:16,730 --> 02:19:18,670
I fumbled, okay?

2201
02:19:23,160 --> 02:19:23,620
Okay.

2202
02:19:26,460 --> 02:19:27,720
I fumbled it.

2203
02:19:29,340 --> 02:19:32,020
Am I trapped down here?

2204
02:19:32,840 --> 02:19:33,300
Oh my god.

2205
02:19:34,100 --> 02:19:34,920
Oh wait, it's over here.

2206
02:19:36,140 --> 02:19:36,940
Oh my god.

2207
02:19:39,600 --> 02:19:40,740
That's bullshit.

2208
02:19:41,300 --> 02:19:42,720
That's actually bullshit.

2209
02:19:45,780 --> 02:19:48,060
Like, why the fuck did it lead?

2210
02:19:48,840 --> 02:19:49,320
Oh my.

2211
02:19:50,420 --> 02:19:53,680
Oh, please, please, please.

2212
02:19:56,140 --> 02:19:56,360
Please.

2213
02:20:02,190 --> 02:20:12,930
we made it we made it oh okay I don't know how little kids

2214
02:20:12,930 --> 02:20:15,770

2246
02:22:57,190 --> 02:22:58,130
I was like, wait a minute.

2247
02:22:58,810 --> 02:23:00,450
Why is there a door on the other side?

2248
02:23:09,950 --> 02:23:10,870
We made it.

2249
02:23:13,470 --> 02:23:15,170
Alright, now we're at the door.

2250
02:23:18,230 --> 02:23:19,530
Oh my god, wait, his legs are shaky.

2251
02:23:19,650 --> 02:23:20,410
Oh, I like that.

2252
02:23:20,510 --> 02:23:21,610
The attention of detail.

2253
02:23:23,010 --> 02:23:24,030
You know what I miss?

2254
02:23:24,090 --> 02:23:24,490
Right.

2255
02:23:24,890 --> 02:23:27,230
Video game movie tie-ins.

2256
02:23:28,530 --> 02:23:30,570
That monster inking was so good.

2257
02:23:31,510 --> 02:23:40,550
I don't know if anyone ever played the monster in the shrek
games back then on the playstation 2 i missed those now

2258
02:23:42,590 --> 02:23:50,350
movie studios just make roblox games or fortnite fortnite
collaboration is our like video game tie-in now

2259
02:23:54,410 --> 02:24:00,950
i that's that's okay okay

2260
02:24:08,050 --> 02:24:17,250
all right we gotta do this all over again I will, yeah, 90%
of them were bad, but when they were good, they were really

2261
02:24:17,250 --> 02:24:17,570
good.

2262
02:24:17,690 --> 02:24:23,190
I used to love the Shrek Titan games, the Shrek Titan games,
and I remember the Shrek Titan games was really good.

2263
02:24:23,350 --> 02:24:25,010
The Monster Ink one was really good.

2264
02:24:25,690 --> 02:24:29,930
Um, what are the ones that I really liked when I was growing
up?

2265
02:24:37,770 --> 02:24:39,510
There were some really good ones.

2266
02:24:40,390 --> 02:24:43,470
Yeah, there were some really shitty ones because it was like
hit or miss.

2267
02:24:45,530 --> 02:24:47,650
But game don't, like, uh...

2268
02:24:48,430 --> 02:24:52,890
Hollywood execs, some Hollywood execs actually cared about
the quality of the game.

2269
02:24:55,430 --> 02:24:57,590
Oh yeah, the Spider-Man 2 games too?

2270
02:24:58,110 --> 02:25:00,950
I feel like, I mean, I feel like there were more hits than
misses.

2271
02:25:01,470 --> 02:25:05,230
I think the Game Boy Advance Titans were the really bad
ones.

2272
02:25:06,110 --> 02:25:12,090
When they tried to make games for all consoles, and they
made one for like, like the Game Boys and Game Boy Advance

2273
02:25:12,090 --> 02:25:12,550
and shit.

2274
02:25:13,630 --> 02:25:16,790
But when they did games for like PlayStation, it were really
good.

2275
02:25:21,960 --> 02:25:23,120
Do I need those?

2276
02:25:23,440 --> 02:25:24,720
It's fine, I don't need them.

2277
02:25:25,520 --> 02:25:29,520
Yeah, the GBA ones were bad, but the PS2 ones were really,
really good.

2278
02:25:38,920 --> 02:25:39,980
Okay, I can just stand here.

2279
02:25:40,160 --> 02:25:40,500
That's good.

2280
02:25:41,560 --> 02:25:44,820
I thought I would have to, like, go through PTSD from the
last one.

2281
02:25:52,400 --> 02:25:53,380
Oh my god.

2282
02:26:02,110 --> 02:26:04,470
Apparently the SpongeBob one was really good, too.

2283
02:26:05,610 --> 02:26:06,410
Are you serious?

2284
02:26:08,570 --> 02:26:10,490
How do I get to the cross that?

2285
02:26:14,760 --> 02:26:15,560
Oh, I'm scared.

2286
02:26:16,160 --> 02:26:19,380
Oh, God.

2287
02:26:20,360 --> 02:26:20,760
No!

2288
02:26:31,480 --> 02:26:32,080
Oh, God.

2289
02:26:32,380 --> 02:26:33,560
This is so hard to control.

2290
02:26:35,020 --> 02:26:35,560
Oh, hey, nice.

2291
02:26:35,660 --> 02:26:36,920
Okay, I didn't have to do any of that.

2292
02:26:37,100 --> 02:26:37,760
Okay, that's cool.

2293
02:26:38,480 --> 02:26:38,880
All right.

2294
02:26:41,720 --> 02:26:43,240
They just gave me a freebie.

2295
02:26:48,570 --> 02:26:48,970
450.

2296
02:26:49,190 --> 02:26:50,250
Okay, it's not that bad.

2297
02:26:50,370 --> 02:26:51,750
It was 450, guys.

2298
02:26:51,830 --> 02:26:53,870
Oh my god, I'm almost broke.

2299
02:26:54,270 --> 02:26:55,730
That's gonna hit my savings.

2300
02:27:01,730 --> 02:27:02,510
It's okay.

2301
02:27:04,010 --> 02:27:05,810
I'm replenishing my savings right now.

2302
02:27:12,230 --> 02:27:12,490
Yeah.

2303
02:27:15,070 --> 02:27:15,430
Okay.

2304
02:27:15,750 --> 02:27:15,990
Nice.

2305
02:27:16,290 --> 02:27:16,610
Full HP.

2306
02:27:18,110 --> 02:27:18,710
Oh, no.

2307
02:27:21,230 --> 02:27:23,210
I'm glad he's trapped in here.

2308
02:27:23,430 --> 02:27:24,130
We're out here.

2309
02:27:26,150 --> 02:27:29,610
Yeah, I can kill him.

2310
02:27:32,010 --> 02:27:33,410
Wait, there's a door right here.

2311
02:27:34,330 --> 02:27:35,790
Oh, invisible wall.

2312
02:27:37,010 --> 02:27:37,950
It's not fair.

2313
02:27:38,210 --> 02:27:39,910
Okay, fishing village, lighthouse.

2314
02:27:41,130 --> 02:27:42,050
Where do I want to go?

2315
02:27:42,650 --> 02:27:45,010
I mean, it says keep out, but dogs can't read.

2316
02:27:52,750 --> 02:27:55,070
Oh, yeah, the Madagascar game was fun, too.

2317
02:27:55,190 --> 02:27:56,290
Yeah, I remember playing that.

2318
02:27:56,370 --> 02:27:57,690
I like the Madagascar game.

2319
02:28:03,680 --> 02:28:06,940
It says keep up, but little did they know dogs can't read

2320
02:28:10,180 --> 02:28:16,760
From words that came You should be very, very quiet Oh wait,
he's not in there

2321
02:28:21,660 --> 02:28:33,660
Famous last words He's like, it's okay, guys He's not in
there, guys Billy, thank you for the 10 gift of chips Thank

2322
02:28:33,660 --> 02:28:42,840
you thank you but yeah I feel like nowadays they just do
like they just do Fortnite collabs they don't have to

2323
02:28:42,840 --> 02:28:51,200
fucking spend hundreds and thousands of dollars on a video
game titan they just fucking make they just oh my god they

2324
02:28:51,200 --> 02:28:57,540
just make they just do a Fortnite collab and call it a day
which sucks because I do miss those either Fortnite collab

2325
02:28:57,540 --> 02:28:58,660
or a Roblox game

2326
02:29:04,590 --> 02:29:09,830
oh my god efficient village am I in?

2327
02:29:15,270 --> 02:29:18,290
Wait, this is too far?

2328
02:29:18,490 --> 02:29:19,750
Yeah, this is too slanted.

2329
02:29:21,550 --> 02:29:22,530
I don't know, the long way.

2330
02:29:29,700 --> 02:29:32,320
Also, I think it's because no one really plays platformers.

2331
02:29:32,460 --> 02:29:34,900
A lot of these games were mostly just platformers.

2332
02:29:35,660 --> 02:29:36,880
So there's like no reason.

2333
02:29:41,120 --> 02:29:41,760
Oh yeah, a key.

2334
02:29:44,160 --> 02:29:49,220
There's like no reason to Fund these types of games If it's
just...

2335
02:29:49,220 --> 02:29:52,880
Because platformers aren't as popular as they are now Or as
they were back then

2336
02:29:56,080 --> 02:30:02,980
I'm missing one where he asked me this one Oh my gosh, yes
I'll have the Scooby Snacks too

2337
02:30:18,170 --> 02:30:19,130
Oh shit!

2338
02:30:19,790 --> 02:30:22,990
fucking gay man oh my god they're everywhere

2339
02:30:29,440 --> 02:30:32,540
all right where i'll go here

2340
02:30:35,800 --> 02:30:46,360
oh i knew it i'm oh i can't do the body slam yet scooby
don't know how to slam the body oh this is not good for

2341
02:30:46,360 --> 02:30:49,460
scooby what the fuck

2342
02:30:56,440 --> 02:30:58,760
oh my god i'm so scared of getting slab.

2343
02:30:59,700 --> 02:31:02,540
I'm, like, not even gonna risk getting the Scooby Snacks.

2344
02:31:07,100 --> 02:31:10,020
Yeah, it's mostly indie does that make platformers now.

2345
02:31:10,200 --> 02:31:10,440
I agree.

2346
02:31:11,720 --> 02:31:13,720
Like, big game companies don't wanna risk it.

2347
02:31:14,520 --> 02:31:15,860
I feel like it's...

2348
02:31:15,860 --> 02:31:18,560
I feel like...

2349
02:31:19,920 --> 02:31:22,060
Indie games don't even...

2350
02:31:22,060 --> 02:31:24,460
It's like the year of the indie games now.

2351
02:31:26,220 --> 02:31:27,200
Because no...

2352
02:31:27,200 --> 02:31:28,280
Because people don't want to...

2353
02:31:28,280 --> 02:31:30,160
Like, uh... Because, like...

2354
02:31:30,420 --> 02:31:36,460
Big publishers, you have to follow like lots of rules and
everything too.

2355
02:31:37,260 --> 02:31:40,060
And indie devs don't want to do that.

2356
02:31:42,480 --> 02:31:44,020
Because like the fucking, what is it called?

2357
02:31:44,820 --> 02:31:47,160
The board of directors control how the game.

2358
02:31:49,320 --> 02:31:52,160
Control the development of the games and they don't want to
listen to that.

2359
02:31:56,200 --> 02:31:57,460
Give me that cake.

2360
02:31:57,780 --> 02:31:57,940
Right.

2361
02:32:05,430 --> 02:32:07,350
Yeah, they just don't want to listen to business, people.

2362
02:32:07,450 --> 02:32:08,970
They want to make the game that they want to make.

2363
02:32:14,570 --> 02:32:16,850
Where the fuck?

2364
02:32:17,010 --> 02:32:19,350
How do I get across the boat from there?

2365
02:32:20,830 --> 02:32:21,590
Alright, what is this?

2366
02:32:21,690 --> 02:32:22,050
Five!

2367
02:32:22,270 --> 02:32:23,270
Oh, I'm broke!

2368
02:32:23,950 --> 02:32:24,670
I'm broke!

2369
02:32:28,410 --> 02:32:29,130
Oh, no!

2370
02:32:31,670 --> 02:32:36,310
Yeah, also, AAA games are definitely a lot more expensive
because they have to pay for, like, everyone in the company.

2371
02:32:37,750 --> 02:32:38,630
Oh, my God.

2372
02:32:38,630 --> 02:32:41,410
I used to be on top of the world.

2373
02:32:43,070 --> 02:32:44,130
What happened?

2374
02:32:44,990 --> 02:32:48,190
I'm $34 down to my name.

2375
02:32:56,530 --> 02:32:57,230
All right.

2376
02:32:57,390 --> 02:32:58,550
I don't have an umbrella.

2377
02:32:58,770 --> 02:33:01,990
We haven't invented umbrellas yet in the Scooby-Doo
universe.

2378
02:33:06,110 --> 02:33:06,410
Yeah.

2379
02:33:06,890 --> 02:33:10,790
Whenever it starts raining, we just toughen it up.

2380
02:33:13,790 --> 02:33:16,570
We have yet to invent umbrellas, guys.

2381
02:33:17,790 --> 02:33:20,650
It's a horrible time in the Scooby-Doo universe.

2382
02:33:21,730 --> 02:33:23,950
The Scooby-Doo lore is crazy.

2383
02:33:24,590 --> 02:33:28,870
Yeah, yeah, whenever it starts raining, we just run out
there with our hands above our heads.

2384
02:33:30,190 --> 02:33:32,370
And just tough it out.

2385
02:33:32,990 --> 02:33:35,310
Or just never go outside when it's raining.

2386
02:33:39,270 --> 02:33:40,550
Oh, I started digging here.

2387

caveman days.

02:34:55,630 --> 02:35:06,390
They didn't know how to jump guys Jumping was a unique

Alright.

2408
02:35:26,900 --> 02:35:28,400
Ooh, I ordered a lot of food.

2409
02:35:29,460 --> 02:35:30,000
I'm hungry.

2410
02:35:30,200 --> 02:35:31,080
I haven't had lunch yet.

2411
02:35:32,280 --> 02:35:36,420
I woke up after my nine-hour stream, and I was like, oh,
fuck.

2412
02:35:38,840 --> 02:35:39,740
What's this?

2413
02:35:40,480 --> 02:35:42,100
Oh, he gave me free chocolates.

2414
02:35:42,480 --> 02:35:42,740
Nice.

2415
02:35:44,900 --> 02:35:46,320
Alright, let's try this real quick.

2416
02:35:47,620 --> 02:35:48,160
Oh!

2417
02:35:48,400 --> 02:35:48,600
Oh!

2418
02:35:58,370 --> 02:36:07,590
I decided to be a little wild order ramen I usually don't do
it because like I they did separate the ramen and like the

2419
02:36:07,590 --> 02:36:14,530
noodles and the soup I usually don't do it I don't risk it
just because like I hate I hate it when the noodles get a

2420
02:36:14,530 --> 02:36:19,110
little too soggy but I risk it because it's a good ramen
place

2421
02:36:26,250 --> 02:36:27,110
And sushi.

2422
02:36:27,250 --> 02:36:28,190
I got sushi too.

2423
02:36:30,490 --> 02:36:30,870
Yeah.

2424
02:36:31,310 --> 02:36:33,680
I have to mix it together myself, which I'm fine with.

2425
02:36:34,390 --> 02:36:34,650
Oh!

2426
02:36:37,370 --> 02:36:38,950
They fucked it up.

2427
02:36:39,910 --> 02:36:44,730
I said I wanted an extra extra tasu because I had chicken
tasu.

2428
02:36:45,570 --> 02:36:47,270
So I wanted tasu with it too.

2429
02:36:48,090 --> 02:36:48,590
It's fine.

2430
02:36:50,050 --> 02:36:51,670
I've been having really bad luck with Uber.

2431
02:36:52,430 --> 02:36:53,410
Uber eats.

2432
02:37:00,930 --> 02:37:02,870
I've accepted it.

2433
02:37:05,210 --> 02:37:07,850
I've accepted it.

2434
02:37:08,270 --> 02:37:10,370
It's just life now.

2435
02:37:12,530 --> 02:37:15,170

02:38:32,790 --> 02:38:34,290

02:38:36,570 --> 02:38:38,270
Like, the distribution.

2457
02:38:39,130 --> 02:38:40,630
The katsu was that heavy.

2458
02:38:41,450 --> 02:38:42,110
Like, the soup.

2459
02:38:42,190 --> 02:38:44,470
I thought it was like, I poured the soup and it was like,
cold.

2460
02:38:44,910 --> 02:38:48,230
And I took the katsu out and, like, because there's a giant
block of katsu.

2461
02:38:49,530 --> 02:38:50,690
Because it's a cheese katsu.

2462
02:38:51,410 --> 02:38:52,630
It's cheese chicken katsu.

2463
02:38:53,230 --> 02:38:58,530
And then the moment I took it out, like, the entire block
was, like, half the soup was gone.

2464
02:39:00,070 --> 02:39:01,290
The water level.

02:41:07,010 --> 02:41:07,710
Because I haven't tabbed.

2495
02:41:08,170 --> 02:41:13,190
There's like a German Christmas market that's going on in my
city.

2496
02:41:14,910 --> 02:41:16,110
They hold it every year.

2497
02:41:18,930 --> 02:41:20,390
And they try to find a good time to go.

2498
02:41:20,710 --> 02:41:22,650
Because I don't want to go during like Christmas week, you
know?

2499
02:41:23,690 --> 02:41:28,270
I'd be like, oh, I don't want to go during Christmas week
because that's going to be fucking hell.

2500
02:41:31,450 --> 02:41:32,790
I love those.

2501
02:41:32,930 --> 02:41:35,490
I hear like a lot of places do it.

2502
02:41:40,480 --> 02:41:42,280
I went there last year and I didn't get to eat.

2503
02:41:42,380 --> 02:41:43,860
I didn't get to try a lot of the food.

2504
02:41:46,660 --> 02:41:47,600
I want to try more.

2505
02:41:48,520 --> 02:41:53,920

Oh my god.

2526
02:44:16,160 --> 02:44:17,340
I guess I've ever seen the Krampus.

2527
02:44:18,800 --> 02:44:19,660
What's it called?

2528
02:44:19,760 --> 02:44:20,640
The Krampus Festival.

2529
02:44:21,200 --> 02:44:23,420
Where like the fucking outfits are literally demon tier.

2530
02:44:24,620 --> 02:44:27,180
I feel like...

2531
02:44:28,840 --> 02:44:31,680
NA did that, I think children would actually cry.

2532
02:44:33,520 --> 02:44:35,120
Bro, it's crazy.

2533
02:44:35,620 --> 02:44:36,800
The Krampus Festivals.

2534
02:44:43,700 --> 02:44:44,960
Yeah, it's so fucking metal.

2535
02:44:46,740 --> 02:44:47,860
That shit is metal as hell.

2536
02:45:00,280 --> 02:45:04,280
I will say, children nowadays are super callable.

2537
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:06,340
I feel like...

2538
02:45:06,340 --> 02:45:09,100
I feel like parents now...

2539
02:45:09,960 --> 02:45:10,580
Um...

2540
02:45:13,580 --> 02:45:16,280
I think it's because, okay, this is my theory.

2541
02:45:17,120 --> 02:45:26,580
It's that, like, a lot of kids, a lot of parents now grew up
with, like, really bad parenting in a way where, like, they

2542
02:45:26,580 --> 02:45:34,160
felt like their parents, like, they felt like their parents,
uh, um, what's the word?

2543
02:45:35,920 --> 02:45:38,000
We're really neglectful of them.

2544
02:45:38,460 --> 02:45:41,880
So when they became parents, they're like, I'm not going to
be, like, my mom.

2545
02:45:43,100 --> 02:45:52,960
care for my child i would pay attention to them and um and
spend time with them but then they ended up being like super

2546
02:45:52,960 --> 02:46:03,780
caught the child ends being like super caught on and um yeah
and like like too much attention given to the child and

2547
02:46:03,780 --> 02:46:13,920
everything and making sure like oh um and making him super
sheltered okay i will say i think that's why I was super

2548
02:46:13,920 --> 02:46:21,760
sheltered because that's what happened to my that's what
happened to my mom her mom was like like neglectful to her

2549
02:46:21,760 --> 02:46:27,820
when she was growing up because she had like two two younger
brothers so like for those who don't know in asia cultures

2550
02:46:27,820 --> 02:46:37,540
like uh sons were highly valued over daughters so because of
that um she had to take care of like you know she had to be

2551
02:46:37,540 --> 02:46:46,220
like the babysitter of the brothers and like the brothers
were treated a lot better than her so when she got older and

2552
02:46:46,220 --> 02:46:52,540
she like when she had me she was like I'm not gonna be like
my mom I'm gonna treat her and I ended up being super

2553
02:46:52,540 --> 02:47:04,500
fucking sheltered and yeah I ended up being super sheltered
and I didn't know the real world because of that just like

2554
02:47:04,500 --> 02:47:13,020
she's like I'm not gonna do the things my mom sure if my
child gets all the attention and everything and now i don't

2555
02:47:13,020 --> 02:47:18,180
and then i the first time i've ever touched the kitchen
stove was when i was 18.

2556
02:47:20,280 --> 02:47:28,820
and then i had to learn everything at college by myself yeah
yeah

2557
02:47:37,670 --> 02:47:44,310
i was allowed to touch the kitchen stove or the oven i think
because they think i would like i don't know burn the house

2558
02:47:44,310 --> 02:47:45,150
down or something

2559
02:47:52,170 --> 02:47:55,170
Yeah, I'm not gonna be a bad mom like my mom.

2560
02:47:55,690 --> 02:47:57,510
And it went from one end to the next.

2561
02:47:57,750 --> 02:48:00,410
Yeah, it went from one extreme end to the next extreme end.

2562
02:48:01,310 --> 02:48:03,390
And you learn Katzdan.

2563
02:48:03,490 --> 02:48:03,770
Yummy.

2564
02:48:04,050 --> 02:48:04,950
Thank you, the super chat, Patrick.

2565
02:48:05,210 --> 02:48:06,530
Thank you, thank you.

2566
02:48:09,510 --> 02:48:12,270
Yeah, but Jackie Chan worked at your corner source.

2567
02:48:12,570 --> 02:48:14,110
Australia would be okay.

2568
02:48:14,390 --> 02:48:15,470
One, two, three, four.

2569
02:48:15,630 --> 02:48:16,490
Thank you, the super chat.

2570
02:48:16,510 --> 02:48:17,330
Thank you, thank you.

2571
02:48:17,690 --> 02:48:18,050
Thank you.

2572
02:48:22,860 --> 02:48:33,360
I think like the new generation of children are Are way too
Clouded Way too clouded and like And like Oh, it's not

2573
02:48:33,360 --> 02:48:42,660
independent at all Oh, and the fact that they are iPad A lot
of them are iPad kids too A lot of them are iPad kids So it

2574
02:48:42,660 --> 02:48:50,060
actually rots their brains They're not actually Practicing
critical thinking Because apparently studies are coming out

2575
02:48:50,060 --> 02:49:00,960
That AI AI and chat GPT is like actually making us think
less critically now.

2576
02:49:01,600 --> 02:49:04,520
We're actually going backwards and developing our brain.

2577
02:49:04,760 --> 02:49:09,400
Like our brains are technically sort of getting smaller now
because we're not critically thinking anymore.

2578
02:49:16,160 --> 02:49:16,600
Yeah.

2579
02:49:17,500 --> 02:49:19,080
I think that's crazy.

2580
02:49:19,740 --> 02:49:20,040
Yeah.

2581
02:49:20,800 --> 02:49:23,840
So we're not like actually thinking for ourselves.

2582
02:49:25,980 --> 02:49:27,940
And also, there's that, what's it called?

2583
02:49:28,220 --> 02:49:28,660
Tocomelon.

2584
02:49:34,780 --> 02:49:35,840
It's really bad.

2585
02:49:36,220 --> 02:49:37,280
Because I talked about this before.

2586
02:49:38,660 --> 02:49:43,380
But, um, you kids' content now, it's all brain rot.

2587
02:49:44,240 --> 02:49:45,820
Because they're like, you don't need it.

2588
02:49:45,880 --> 02:49:54,200
Because, like, you know, you know, back then we had, like,
Teletubbies, Sesame Street, um, Between the Lions.

2589
02:49:54,700 --> 02:49:55,300
Shit like that.

2590
02:49:55,340 --> 02:49:57,220
Like, we're educational shows.

2591
02:49:57,660 --> 02:50:03,100
But, like, kids, now, they just go on YouTube or go on
Roblox and because of that a lot of them are like YouTube

2592
02:50:03,100 --> 02:50:10,700
slop or like kids slop so they're not like actually like
educational for children for to develop their brain and Coco

2593
02:50:10,700 --> 02:50:16,120
Lemon a Coco Melon I talked about it for it but for those
who haven't heard about this before Coco Melon actually

2594
02:50:16,120 --> 02:50:26,620
makes your kids more stupid it actually makes your child
dumber if you make them watch Coco Lemon or Coco Coco Melon

2595
02:50:26,620 --> 02:50:45,350
yeah Look, I told you guys, I literally sit next to a child
and a father and she had like a fucking music video playing

2596
02:50:45,350 --> 02:50:54,470
in the corner of her fucking iPad, like those kids' iPads,
while playing a Roblox game.

2597
02:50:54,970 --> 02:50:57,790
And I was like, how do you pay attention to that?

2598
02:50:57,890 --> 02:51:03,830
I was like, it's like those memes where like the silver
surfer is in the corner.

2599
02:51:03,830 --> 02:51:05,670
Bro, something was fake.

2600
02:51:05,930 --> 02:51:07,130
That's what she was doing.

2601
02:51:07,350 --> 02:51:09,110
I was like, Jesus Christ.

2602
02:51:11,570 --> 02:51:12,590
It's not a meme.

2603
02:51:12,830 --> 02:51:14,270
It's actual real life.

2604
02:51:16,670 --> 02:51:19,870
I was like, it's actual real ass life.

2605
02:51:20,630 --> 02:51:21,610
That they're doing that.

2606
02:51:21,890 --> 02:51:23,990
I thought it was just a funny meme.

2607
02:51:43,670 --> 02:51:44,530
Alright, subway surfer.

2608
02:51:57,300 --> 02:51:58,840
No, but it was like on the corner.

2609
02:51:59,140 --> 02:52:00,100
It was on the corner.

2610
02:52:00,200 --> 02:52:01,320
I don't watch this when I'm gaming.

2611
02:52:02,100 --> 02:52:06,800
I do work like I eat like I play videos when I'm eating

2612
02:52:12,710 --> 02:52:20,470
I can't even listen to music while I play rank I don't know
how people do it I personally can't it distracts me way too

2613
02:52:20,470 --> 02:52:34,840
much and you and you a guy he's like top 500 and Overwatch
he doesn't even play with audio I don't know how he does it

2614
02:52:34,840 --> 02:52:40,940
he like he doesn't even play with audio he has the audio off
and just has like a tv show on the side like a youtube video

2615
02:52:40,940 --> 02:52:48,740
or or someone else's stream on the second monitor while he
plays overwatch top 500 with no audio he's just like i don't

2616
02:52:48,740 --> 02:52:57,120
need audio i know what's going on yeah i was like bro what
the but

2617
02:53:04,440 --> 02:53:16,420
i could not do that but also like i feel like top 500
players and pro players like there's a huge gap between the

2618
02:53:16,420 --> 02:53:24,140
two i was like i don't know you guys saw a clip of faker
doing the stopwatch test because when you're pro player you

2619
02:53:24,140 --> 02:53:30,480
gotta be aware of so many things including like cooldowns
and everything through sheer instinct like keeping track of

2620
02:53:30,480 --> 02:53:39,400
enemy cooldowns and everything so like there was a clip of
faker being like can you stop the time like stopwatch

2621
02:53:39,400 --> 02:53:48,380
through pure instinct um at five seconds like just to like
internally count like internally realize like when when you

2622
02:53:48,380 --> 02:53:54,320
have to stop like when it would be five seconds because he
has to be like when you're a pro in league um or just pro

2623
02:53:54,320 --> 02:54:00,640
player in general you have to like be able to be aware of
counting down enemy cooldowns and everything so you know

2624
02:54:00,640 --> 02:54:06,680
like when they don't have cooldowns so so he literally was
like yeah i could do that and he got the stopwatch looked at

2625
02:54:06,680 --> 02:54:12,980
camera stopped at exactly 5.00 seconds like exactly it was
crazy i was

2626
02:54:17,500 --> 02:54:25,100
like that's and then like i asked my pro friends i was like
can you guys do that because i was curious so i asked like a

2627
02:54:25,100 --> 02:54:32,680
couple of pros i was like um i was like wait screen share
and uh close your eyes and click the stopwatch they're not

2628
02:54:32,680 --> 02:54:39,940
as good as faker but it was like four point it was like 4.9
something or like 5.0 like it would be like one it'll be

2629
02:54:39,940 --> 02:54:50,000
like 0.0 something seconds off but it's not like faker where
he gets it exact i was like Jesus, like 5.0, exactly.

2630
02:54:51,180 --> 02:54:54,640
Like, my friends, they would, like, be, like, 0.something
off.

2631
02:54:54,880 --> 02:54:57,240
It was still pretty, like, cool.

2632
02:54:57,320 --> 02:54:58,580
It's still pretty cool to see.

2633
02:54:58,920 --> 02:55:01,440
Like, being able to get it around there.

2634
02:55:01,580 --> 02:55:05,380
But 5.0 is, like, insane.

2635
02:55:06,480 --> 02:55:07,860
It's, like, inhumane.

2636
02:55:08,440 --> 02:55:09,940
I swear, he was grown in a test.

2637
02:55:10,800 --> 02:55:13,200
He was grown in a test tube to play league.

2638
02:55:13,600 --> 02:55:15,160
I swear to God.

2639
02:55:16,980 --> 02:55:21,820
They were like, we must create the ultimate being for League
of Legends.

2640
02:55:22,140 --> 02:55:22,540
I...

2641
02:55:33,470 --> 02:55:36,010
The perfect league player, yeah.

2642
02:55:43,230 --> 02:55:43,570
Bro.

2643
02:55:45,150 --> 02:55:49,390
I heard that he's gonna meet the president soon, too.

2644
02:55:49,870 --> 02:55:51,510
And they might talk about, like...

2645
02:55:51,510 --> 02:55:54,030
I was like, oh my god.

2646
02:55:54,590 --> 02:55:55,330
That's crazy.

2647
02:55:56,590 --> 02:56:06,770
exempt from the army just so he could play more league like
getting exemptions for like pro players for league players

2648
02:56:06,770 --> 02:56:14,430
yeah he's gonna meet like the press yeah because he's giving
a lot of clout and stuff like a lot of attention to Korea

2649
02:56:14,430 --> 02:56:22,550
because he is the best league player in the world and I saw
an article saying like saying like he's there might be talks

2650
02:56:22,550 --> 02:56:31,530
of like talks of him with him and the to try and see, like,
like, the players, I guess, like, for League, to be exempt

2651
02:56:31,530 --> 02:56:36,810
from, to be exempt from the army, so they can keep bringing
more medals for League.

2652
02:56:37,590 --> 02:56:39,850
Yeah, he served his own, in his own way, yeah.

2653
02:56:48,750 --> 02:56:50,910
Yeah, they give a super chat, thank you.

2654
02:56:56,580 --> 02:57:00,460
Yeah, because it brings a lot of attention to Korea, too,
like, what he does.

2655
02:57:04,170 --> 02:57:04,650
Right?

2656
02:57:07,570 --> 02:57:09,190
Yeah, he's just that good.

2657
02:57:10,670 --> 02:57:12,850
Bro, how old is Faker anyway?

2658
02:57:22,160 --> 02:57:24,500
Also, like, they're often not doing it in a way because
unfair.

2659
02:57:25,060 --> 02:57:27,660
I think it's also because, like, for BTS,

2660
02:57:32,830 --> 02:57:36,290
I think it's also because, like, they think, like, yeah,
like, they want to make...

2661
02:57:36,290 --> 02:57:38,070
They don't want to, like, look bad, you know?

2662
02:57:43,730 --> 02:57:46,290
I guess it's, like, different circumstances, too.

2663
02:57:47,630 --> 02:57:48,430
And everything.

2664
02:57:52,150 --> 02:57:52,550
Hmm.

2665
02:57:54,870 --> 02:57:56,510
he's like 29

2666
02:57:59,590 --> 02:58:10,170
I read in an article that all the players that Faker used to
fight with like not fight but like burst with like all the

2667
02:58:10,170 --> 02:58:20,770
his like arch like his rivals back then they're all coaches
now and he's still gaming I thought that was funny like

2668
02:58:22,770 --> 02:58:29,210
Like, his rivals that he versed over the years all became
coaches of big teams.

2669
02:58:29,370 --> 02:58:30,830
But he's still actually playing.

2670
02:58:31,410 --> 02:58:32,890
Yeah, he's still going.

2671
02:58:38,710 --> 02:58:39,570
And that's interesting.

2672
02:58:41,850 --> 02:58:43,590
And he still got it.

2673
02:58:43,770 --> 02:58:45,910
Bro, he's going to be, like, those basketball players.

2674
02:58:47,070 --> 02:58:47,550
Where...

2675
02:58:47,550 --> 02:58:50,090
Yeah, kids of, like...

2676
02:58:50,090 --> 02:58:51,830
I swear, his kids are going to get scouted.

2677
02:58:52,690 --> 02:58:55,950
Whatever he settles down, his kids are going to get scouted.

2678
02:58:55,970 --> 02:58:59,190
like basketball players like basketball player kids

2679
02:59:02,670 --> 02:59:21,600
right that's gonna be crazy no it's gonna be genetic because
it's all hand-knit coordination if he gets kids

2680
02:59:31,270 --> 02:59:40,130
when that's like esports retirement it depends on the esport
it depends on the game there's some players that are like 35

2681
02:59:40,130 --> 02:59:50,110
plus and still pro a random wide eye expression from your
skin so he kills me every damn time see you think of this

2682
02:59:50,110 --> 02:59:51,410
super chat thank you thank you

2683
02:59:56,830 --> 03:00:01,650
sorry guys I'm still eating I just didn't eat lunch at all
so I'm hungry

2684
03:00:09,560 --> 03:00:11,400
but it's like a Valorant place

2685
03:00:14,420 --> 03:00:24,880
those children the kids from like Valorant couples going
places from I swear I think Valorant is the only esport that

2686
03:00:24,880 --> 03:00:33,380
I've seen we're like both because like there's a very big
female pro scene too in Valorant and like I swear like I

2687
03:00:33,380 --> 03:00:40,880
feel like Valorant is like the only esport I've seen where
like um where like a lot of the Valant pros just date each

2688
03:00:40,880 --> 03:00:53,440
other and like because like the top Valorant pros are
literally just it's the next generation of gamers like no

2689
03:00:53,440 --> 03:00:59,000
not apex because there's not really a lot of female a pro
like there's no pro circuit for female apex players i mean

2690
03:00:59,000 --> 03:01:10,240
there is but it's not like that big but there's a very big
valorant pro circuit for female players as i know because

2691
03:01:10,240 --> 03:01:17,700
i've seen like i've seen like the top like you know team
like the top valorant teams for like guys and girls it's

2692
03:01:17,700 --> 03:01:21,580
just all like You see the Twitter profiles, you click on it,
and it's really, like, another pro.

2693
03:01:33,440 --> 03:01:34,000
Oh, my God.

2694
03:01:34,860 --> 03:01:40,480
I read the, there's, like, this, the, there was a, I don't
keep up with Valorant, but it's all my for you.

2695
03:01:41,180 --> 03:01:43,880
But, yeah, it's the dating game.

2696
03:01:44,200 --> 03:01:45,960
But, and that was really funny.

2697
03:01:46,620 --> 03:01:51,660
But there was a, there was, like, a women's tournament for
Valorant recently, like, a really big one.

2698
03:01:52,660 --> 03:01:54,160
And I think it was, like, Brazilian team.

2699
03:01:55,100 --> 03:01:57,100
They were talking about the stats of the Brazilian team.

2700
03:01:57,600 --> 03:02:05,440
And apparently, the top fragger, the best in the tournament,
the best player is on the Brazilian team.

2701
03:02:06,320 --> 03:02:10,280
The best, like, Valorant player for that tournament was on
the Brazilian team.

2702
03:02:10,800 --> 03:02:14,680
And then the worst player on that tournament was also on the
Brazilian team.

2703
03:02:15,240 --> 03:02:17,360
And apparently, they were both dating.

2704
03:02:18,480 --> 03:02:20,900
Some people are like, wow, it's crazy.

2705
03:02:21,100 --> 03:02:22,120
The worst player.

2706
03:02:22,480 --> 03:02:25,080
This is the first time the worst player and the best player.

2707
03:02:25,100 --> 03:02:29,420
player are a couple like in the same tournament

2708
03:02:33,820 --> 03:02:37,360
yeah it like balanced it out

2709
03:02:41,900 --> 03:02:51,580
very it balanced it out I thought it was funny like stat
wise basically

2710
03:02:55,630 --> 03:03:08,010
I think they won the tournament too i still think like it is
wild though like i think it is i personally think dating

2711
03:03:08,010 --> 03:03:15,230
inside when you're a part of some a team and you're dating
the players in the team it's like it's scary because it's

2712
03:03:15,230 --> 03:03:23,850
like the dynamics for that as a team as itself is so bad i
feel because you it's like the whole like never date your

2713
03:03:23,850 --> 03:03:29,190
co-worker shit it's literally that It's a bad idea.

2714
03:03:34,950 --> 03:03:36,650
Like, I was like, that's risky as fuck.

2715
03:03:36,810 --> 03:03:38,570
And someone's like, the power of love.

2716
03:03:39,270 --> 03:03:40,870
God, deep synergy.

2717
03:03:41,390 --> 03:03:41,570
Bro.

2718
03:03:46,670 --> 03:03:49,290
But when you get an argument, I've seen this happen.

2719
03:03:50,350 --> 03:03:51,770
I talked about this before.

2720
03:03:54,390 --> 03:03:54,870
But...

2721
03:03:56,510 --> 03:03:58,410
I've seen this before as a spectator.

2722
03:03:59,510 --> 03:04:00,190
That's crazy.

2723
03:04:00,910 --> 03:04:03,070
I won't mention which game it was.

2724
03:04:03,570 --> 03:04:03,990
But...

2725
03:04:04,010 --> 03:04:17,570
I was watching I was watching a scrim um and the couple was
fighting during practice and the rest of the team was just

2726
03:04:17,570 --> 03:04:24,650
silent it was so uncomfortable and I was just watching too I
wasn't even part of the team or anything I was just watching

2727
03:04:24,650 --> 03:04:32,830
and and like the couple was just like hard fighting each
other and like the rest of the team said nothing and we're

2728
03:04:32,830 --> 03:04:35,670
just sitting there and was Like, what the fuck do we do?

2729
03:04:43,590 --> 03:04:46,010
I was just like, oh my god.

2730
03:04:47,310 --> 03:04:48,530
That's so uncomfortable.

2731
03:04:49,510 --> 03:04:53,770
And I asked my friend, I was like, bro, what the fuck?

2732
03:04:53,950 --> 03:04:57,430
Like, is this, is this like common?

2733
03:04:57,730 --> 03:05:00,910
And then my friend was like, yeah, no, this happens like
almost every scream.

2734
03:05:01,090 --> 03:05:03,890
And I'm like, bro, that's a terrible environment.

2735
03:05:06,270 --> 03:05:14,750
like like their friend was like yeah like yeah so

2736
03:05:21,010 --> 03:05:25,790
they're like mom and dad's fighting and you're just like in
your room with your headphones I'd be like everything is

2737
03:05:25,790 --> 03:05:37,550
okay it's okay I guess what up you guys want to play game
you guys

2738
03:05:42,980 --> 03:05:44,840
Yeah, put the headphones on.

2739
03:05:45,300 --> 03:05:46,660
Pretend everything is okay.

2740
03:05:53,610 --> 03:05:54,710
Okay, I'm almost done, guys.

2741
03:05:54,870 --> 03:05:57,070
This game has been running for a very long time.

2742
03:06:10,250 --> 03:06:12,010
Why is it wrong to date if playing pro?

2743
03:06:12,190 --> 03:06:12,550
But okay.

2744
03:06:12,970 --> 03:06:15,110
It's like, I meant like if you are...

2745
03:06:15,110 --> 03:06:17,070
It's like in a team environment.

2746
03:06:17,230 --> 03:06:17,930
Because you're both...

2747
03:06:17,930 --> 03:06:20,910
Because like, you can't really...

2748
03:06:20,910 --> 03:06:23,510
You have biases in the team.

2749
03:06:24,070 --> 03:06:27,770
So if you're in a pro play, even in sports, pro play...

2750
03:06:27,910 --> 03:06:36,170
work as well there are biases and there's favoritism going
in um so that's what's wrong because like you know yeah

2751
03:06:36,170 --> 03:06:46,150
there's conflicts of interest and everything so like and
then if if if they break up you can't just leave the team

2752
03:06:46,150 --> 03:06:54,390
because there's con if you're contracted and you break up
you can't just leave the team because you're contracted to

2753
03:06:54,390 --> 03:07:03,510
play until like the end of your contract so obviously that
fucks with synergy too yeah like you know you got play on

2754
03:07:03,510 --> 03:07:13,130
the team with like you know your ex so the put that the
drama is too high yeah it's very awkward

2755
03:07:18,350 --> 03:07:28,010
yeah that's one thing that's the risk that's the riskiest
part even during like the day Part two but You know if you

2756
03:07:28,010 --> 03:07:35,770
criticize One of the players You know one of the couples
Like obviously their partner Is gonna hard defend them

2757
03:07:35,770 --> 03:07:42,210
Because I've seen that happen before So one time I've seen
it happen before Like one of my friends told me about it But

2758
03:07:42,910 --> 03:07:50,310
There was a couple on the team And every time they criticize
One of the players Like in the couple The other player will

2759
03:07:50,310 --> 03:07:57,730
hard defend them Being like No What they're doing What's not
their fault like they're doing okay so the other player

2760
03:07:57,730 --> 03:08:04,270
would never learn because like the other what like they
always have someone defending them being like so they'll

2761
03:08:04,270 --> 03:08:09,410
never learn to be better because like they always had
someone be like no you're doing great you're doing it's not

2762
03:08:09,410 --> 03:08:16,950
you it's not you it's like the team or like it's something
else so there's always like that coming in too so that's why

2763
03:08:16,950 --> 03:08:21,310
i think like like like never date your co-worker is like
very important

2764
03:08:25,010 --> 03:08:28,170
It just discourages feedback and criticism, too.

2765
03:08:32,910 --> 03:08:35,450
That's why, like, that's the whole thing.

2766
03:08:42,130 --> 03:08:42,510
Wow.

2767
03:08:45,030 --> 03:08:45,950
I said they never learn.

2768
03:08:50,470 --> 03:08:59,070
Now, what about the drag wounds dating each other or dating,
insert, bad name, rest in peace with Mr. Broken Bonding.

2769
03:08:59,250 --> 03:09:00,250
Thank you, the super chat.

2770
03:09:00,430 --> 03:09:01,930
I suggested some names, too.

2771
03:09:01,990 --> 03:09:03,650
I was like, you guys should be called boobies.

2772
03:09:03,690 --> 03:09:12,730
you know boo or boobers I was like oh my god what do we guys
call boobers or boobies

2773
03:09:21,060 --> 03:09:27,860
I thought it was funny or the boobus

2774
03:09:32,780 --> 03:09:45,540
very choice yeah because it's boo you know boo they're like
they're like mince little boobies that's so good obviously

2775
03:09:45,540 --> 03:09:52,480
she said no I said that during like we were setting up for
the main cafe

2776
03:10:05,860 --> 03:10:15,460
he's like shut the fuck up Yoki I'm like fair I think it's a
great name I think boobers is also good

2777
03:10:24,700 --> 03:10:31,960
yeah and then like whisk boob goons can be boob goons
boogoons boogoons you know

2778
03:10:50,630 --> 03:10:59,490
as a vtuber fan a lot of vtuber vtuber don't have fandom
names I don't know if you guys noticed that especially those

2779
03:10:59,490 --> 03:11:11,070
who are like more um there's some like I think it's a I
think especially on Twitch, a lot of Twitch F YouTubers, I

2780
03:11:11,070 --> 03:11:11,790
think I'll be specific.

2781
03:11:11,930 --> 03:11:15,430
A lot of Twitch F YouTubers don't really have fandom names.

2782
03:11:17,930 --> 03:11:26,850
Because it was like, fandom names I think was like, um,
started because of, uh, because of JP's side of like, uh,

2783
03:11:27,430 --> 03:11:28,010
with JP.

2784
03:11:28,430 --> 03:11:33,310
But when like the Western side of YouTubers started going,
there wasn't really fandom name stuff before.

2785
03:11:34,790 --> 03:11:36,570
Yeah, Twitch YouTubers normally don't have them.

2786
03:11:37,930 --> 03:11:41,290
It makes it more, it makes it more like a community.

2787
03:11:42,690 --> 03:11:43,870
And I like that.

2788
03:11:52,990 --> 03:11:54,230
Alright, I just finished eating, guys.

2789
03:11:54,790 --> 03:11:56,270
Sorry, this was a long intermission.

2790
03:11:57,750 --> 03:11:59,390
I just wanted to finish my food.

2791
03:12:02,270 --> 03:12:03,990
It was a nice hangout, you know?

2792
03:12:05,610 --> 03:12:07,230
Nice little intermission.

2793
03:12:07,950 --> 03:12:08,650
I'm just chatting.

2794
03:12:10,250 --> 03:12:12,870
But everyone on Twitch has a cute name for the channel
points and subscription.

2795
03:12:13,150 --> 03:12:14,430

I grabbed a sandwich right here.

Okay, that's fine.

I can take these.

2811
03:13:43,310 --> 03:13:44,450
Alright, up we go.

03:13:45,930 --> 03:13:46,850

Guys, it's okay.

2815
03:13:49,750 --> 03:13:51,850
I'm slowly rebuilding the economy, guys.

2816
03:13:52,050 --> 03:13:53,730
I'm starting a new savings fund.

2817
03:13:54,750 --> 03:13:58,650
I legitimately don't even remember like half things I talked
during the food.

2818
03:14:00,390 --> 03:14:02,270
Oh, no, I don't have a lot of HP now.

2819
03:14:04,130 --> 03:14:08,910
I will say, I actually don't remember half the things I
talked about.

2820
03:14:10,730 --> 03:14:11,570
Oh, shit!

2821
03:14:12,330 --> 03:14:14,210
I looked, okay, okay, it's fine, it's fine, we're fine.

2822
03:14:15,550 --> 03:14:16,690
Wait, does it go back up?

2823
03:14:22,890 --> 03:14:24,570
Oh, do I have to press that button?

2824
03:14:24,710 --> 03:14:26,790
I have to press the button again, okay.

2825
03:14:27,130 --> 03:14:28,510
Oh, wait, no, it goes back up, right?

2826
03:14:31,290 --> 03:14:33,230
What is he even supposed to be doing?

2827
03:14:34,550 --> 03:14:35,290
Do I have to?

2828
03:14:35,430 --> 03:14:36,750
Oh my god, I think I do.

2829
03:14:38,330 --> 03:14:39,070
Oh my god.

2830
03:14:39,130 --> 03:14:40,010
I have to race.

2831
03:14:41,930 --> 03:14:43,370
Are you fucking kidding me?

2832
03:14:43,910 --> 03:14:44,310
Okay,

2833
03:14:48,730 --> 03:14:49,470
I have to race.

2834
03:14:50,550 --> 03:14:52,310
I have to race against this stupid thing.

2835
03:14:52,390 --> 03:14:54,170
I don't even know what I'm supposed to do here.

2836
03:14:56,550 --> 03:14:56,950
Okay.

2837
03:14:58,090 --> 03:14:59,990
I'm going as fast as I can!

2838
03:15:02,170 --> 03:15:04,030
Four legs can take me.

2839
03:15:08,360 --> 03:15:09,800
Okay, we're almost there.

2840
03:15:12,180 --> 03:15:13,080
Okay, now what?

2841
03:15:14,880 --> 03:15:15,560
Oh, okay.

2842
03:15:18,740 --> 03:15:20,480
Oh, I have to break it.

2843
03:15:21,900 --> 03:15:22,420
Super...

2844
03:15:22,420 --> 03:15:23,680
Oh, I got super smashed.

2845
03:15:23,840 --> 03:15:24,140
Okay.

2846
03:15:24,640 --> 03:15:26,320
After jumping and smashed that.

2847
03:15:26,420 --> 03:15:26,680
Okay.

2848
03:15:27,260 --> 03:15:29,000
I got the super smashed now.

2849
03:15:30,640 --> 03:15:31,700
Am I supposed to be here?

2850
03:15:32,440 --> 03:15:33,180
Oh, thank God.

2851
03:15:33,240 --> 03:15:33,680
Okay, okay.

2852
03:15:34,400 --> 03:15:34,680
me up.

2853
03:15:34,840 --> 03:15:35,340
Okay, that's good.

2854
03:15:35,820 --> 03:15:37,020
I thought I broke the game.

2855
03:15:43,390 --> 03:15:43,930
Alright, nice.

2856
03:15:45,810 --> 03:15:46,610
Alright, um...

2857
03:15:47,530 --> 03:15:48,490
Alright, it doesn't move.

2858
03:15:48,610 --> 03:15:48,970
That's cool.

2859
03:15:51,990 --> 03:15:53,190
Alright, where do I go?

2860
03:15:53,370 --> 03:15:53,730
Scooby?

2861
03:15:55,930 --> 03:15:57,690
Oh, I can use Fight enemies too?

2862
03:15:57,750 --> 03:15:58,990
Oh, it doesn't work on this guy?

2863
03:16:00,010 --> 03:16:01,050
Alright, let's try it.

2864
03:16:01,330 --> 03:16:02,190
Oh, it does!

2865
03:16:02,310 --> 03:16:02,950
Wait, that's good.

2866
03:16:03,050 --> 03:16:03,330
Okay.

2867
03:16:03,750 --> 03:16:05,270
Another mechanic I can use.

2868
03:16:05,410 --> 03:16:09,050
I think that is more... That one It's definitely more
reliable.

2869
03:16:10,950 --> 03:16:12,830
Yeah, it's 100% more reliable.

2870
03:16:13,350 --> 03:16:15,250
God damn, I cannot get the spooky stacks.

2871
03:16:17,990 --> 03:16:19,190
Yeah, I like that more.

2872
03:16:19,930 --> 03:16:23,050
I like that more than the goddamn fucking head bash.

2873
03:16:23,330 --> 03:16:24,290
It's so inconsistent.

2874
03:16:24,990 --> 03:16:27,050
It's so hard to control the head bash.

2875
03:16:31,530 --> 03:16:31,950
Okay.

2876
03:16:32,830 --> 03:16:35,590
Alright, I don't think I can afford this.

2877
03:16:37,410 --> 03:16:37,930
Oh.

2878
03:16:40,850 --> 03:16:42,430
No, I'm poor.

2879
03:16:43,450 --> 03:16:45,050
I'm so poor.

2880
03:16:46,150 --> 03:16:46,890
Scooby-Doo!

2881
03:16:49,030 --> 03:16:53,530
The Scooby-Sack economy didn't work so well for us.

2882
03:16:55,830 --> 03:16:57,530
Okay, but what does that do?

2883
03:16:58,850 --> 03:17:00,370
What the fuck did I do there?

2884
03:17:01,910 --> 03:17:03,030
We're homeless.

2885
03:17:04,410 --> 03:17:06,350
I don't know what this is doing, either.

2886
03:17:11,050 --> 03:17:15,050
We're one-way shortcut to the courtyard outside of Mystic
Manor.

2887
03:17:15,390 --> 03:17:16,190
Oh, my God.

2888
03:17:17,790 --> 03:17:19,110
Okay, we gotta backtrack.

2889
03:17:19,250 --> 03:17:20,090
We gotta go back.

2890
03:17:21,150 --> 03:17:22,950
We gotta grab all the Scooby snacks.

2891
03:17:26,370 --> 03:17:28,310
I thought I had it all.

2892
03:17:28,810 --> 03:17:30,730
Oh, it activated this.

2893
03:17:31,890 --> 03:17:32,670
It's okay.

2894
03:17:32,770 --> 03:17:33,530
We can make it.

2895
03:17:35,370 --> 03:17:36,190
Yeah, it's this.

2896
03:17:36,850 --> 03:17:37,870
I just noticed it.

2897
03:17:38,710 --> 03:17:39,110
Alright.

2898
03:17:40,210 --> 03:17:43,430
When I go back, there's a lot of Scooby Snacks I missed out
on here.

2899
03:17:46,330 --> 03:17:47,610
Yeah, no, I need a lot of them.

2900
03:17:47,650 --> 03:17:49,830
I don't even know where, which ones I...

2901
03:17:50,730 --> 03:17:52,190
Where I left majority of...

2902
03:17:52,190 --> 03:17:52,870
Oh, shit!

2903
03:17:53,050 --> 03:17:53,430
That's fine.

2904
03:17:57,390 --> 03:17:58,950
Alright, we got this.

2905
03:18:00,970 --> 03:18:01,470
It's fine.

2906
03:18:01,550 --> 03:18:03,050
There's a lot of sandwiches all around.

2907
03:18:04,450 --> 03:18:04,810
Okay.

2908
03:18:06,430 --> 03:18:07,510
Where is the shadow?

2909
03:18:09,830 --> 03:18:10,190
Okay.

2910
03:18:10,950 --> 03:18:13,030
Where is the deaf perception?

2911
03:18:19,170 --> 03:18:20,790
Oh my god, we're in.

2912
03:18:21,090 --> 03:18:21,790
Okay, I got it.

2913
03:18:22,010 --> 03:18:22,390
I found it.

2914
03:18:23,170 --> 03:18:24,070
I found it.

2915
03:18:24,190 --> 03:18:24,330
Yes.

2916
03:18:26,450 --> 03:18:28,130
You don't understand.

2917
03:18:28,870 --> 03:18:30,230
I couldn't find...

2918
03:18:30,230 --> 03:18:30,610
No!

2919
03:18:31,290 --> 03:18:33,470
Slap dunked into the ocean.

2920
03:18:35,490 --> 03:18:36,690
Right, right.

2921
03:18:37,750 --> 03:18:39,470
Are you fucking kidding me?

2922
03:18:40,210 --> 03:18:44,530

2925
03:19:12,530 --> 03:19:13,930
The plus two adds up a lot.

2926
03:19:14,110 --> 03:19:14,350
All right.

2927
03:19:14,610 --> 03:19:15,750
We gotta figure it out.

2928
03:19:15,910 --> 03:19:16,930
Okay, we are here.

2929
03:19:17,250 --> 03:19:18,490
It's a warp game.

2930
03:19:19,470 --> 03:19:20,470
Oh, my God.

2931
03:19:20,690 --> 03:19:21,430
We are here.

2932
03:19:25,550 --> 03:19:26,930
Okay, there you go.

2933
03:19:29,390 --> 03:19:30,910
Where the fuck am I?

2934
03:19:32,030 --> 03:19:33,030
Where's this place?

2935
03:19:33,730 --> 03:19:34,790
How did I get here?

2936
03:19:35,270 --> 03:19:36,930
How did I get here?

2937
03:19:39,130 --> 03:19:39,610
Okay.

2938
03:19:40,830 --> 03:19:41,310
Okay.

2939
03:19:42,310 --> 03:19:43,550
Okay, there's some here.

2940
03:19:46,950 --> 03:19:49,730
I know I left a lot at the fishing area.

2941
03:19:52,450 --> 03:19:53,130
There must be more.

2942
03:19:53,390 --> 03:19:54,790
Okay, there must be.

2943
03:19:54,790 --> 03:19:55,230
Yeah, I knew it.

2944
03:19:55,270 --> 03:19:56,270
There's some here.

2945
03:19:57,270 --> 03:19:57,750
Oh,

2946
03:20:02,520 --> 03:20:02,600

2947
03:20:02,900 --> 03:20:03,280
Oh, no.

2948
03:20:03,340 --> 03:20:04,360
Scooby, you're gonna drown.

2949
03:20:04,420 --> 03:20:04,960
Okay, we're fine.

2950
03:20:05,120 --> 03:20:05,340
We're fine.

2951
03:20:06,320 --> 03:20:07,500
Everything is fine.

2952
03:20:08,780 --> 03:20:10,120
Dog did not drown.

2953
03:20:12,340 --> 03:20:13,160
I'll get up there.

2954
03:20:18,930 --> 03:20:19,670
Okay, nice.

2955
03:20:19,690 --> 03:20:25,930

you for the super chat thank you thank you Not the Scooby
Snack production!

2958
03:20:52,050 --> 03:20:54,550
They stopped selling it to the people!

2959
03:20:57,290 --> 03:21:03,170
Now the Scooby Snacks is only reserved for the developers of
OpenAI.

2960
03:21:04,210 --> 03:21:04,790
Dogs.

2961
03:21:05,010 --> 03:21:06,270
Also, I guess the devs too.

2962
03:21:08,870 --> 03:21:12,130
It's only reserved for the dogs of the devs.

2963
03:21:12,770 --> 03:21:14,050
In OpenAI.

2964
03:21:18,280 --> 03:21:21,220
No, they don't need that.

2965
03:21:26,230 --> 03:21:28,370
We gotta go to that one area.

2966
03:21:30,050 --> 03:21:31,450
It's like, is it back here?

2967
03:21:31,570 --> 03:21:32,310
It might be back here.

2968
03:21:32,450 --> 03:21:33,410
Okay, I gotta save.

2969
03:21:38,980 --> 03:21:40,220
Must be back here.

2970
03:21:44,090 --> 03:21:45,690
Pop the bubble, Scooby.

2971
03:21:45,890 --> 03:21:47,330
You gotta do it.

2972
03:21:48,350 --> 03:21:52,470
Oh, this is like an extra jump, too.

2973
03:21:52,650 --> 03:21:53,210
Which is nice.

2974
03:21:53,930 --> 03:21:55,950
I wonder if it's like...

2975
03:21:56,170 --> 03:21:56,910
I knew it.

2976
03:21:58,570 --> 03:21:59,870
I fucking knew it.

2977
03:22:01,090 --> 03:22:03,070
I don't know what that did, but I knew it.

2978
03:22:04,730 --> 03:22:06,190
I knew there was stuff there.

2979
03:22:07,190 --> 03:22:09,070
Oh my god, I could do double jumps here.

2980
03:22:11,870 --> 03:22:13,130
Yeah, I left a lot of...

2981
03:22:13,130 --> 03:22:14,770
I left way too many treats.

2982
03:22:16,690 --> 03:22:18,570
Is it this?

2983
03:22:22,430 --> 03:22:24,390
Okay, I assume that...

2984
03:22:24,390 --> 03:22:25,710
I pushed the button!

2985
03:22:25,830 --> 03:22:26,150
What the fuck?

2986
03:22:26,170 --> 03:22:28,070
Fuck did the button open?

2987
03:22:31,870 --> 03:22:32,850
Oh, round one.

2988
03:22:34,690 --> 03:22:37,050
The fuck did the button- oh, it's this.

2989
03:22:38,190 --> 03:22:39,450
Okay, that makes more sense.

2990
03:22:44,340 --> 03:22:45,100
All right, that's a lot.

2991
03:22:49,320 --> 03:22:49,900
No!

2992
03:22:50,440 --> 03:22:52,400
I need those snacks.

2993
03:22:54,060 --> 03:22:55,520
Please, I need those snacks.

2994
03:22:56,240 --> 03:22:57,560
You're gonna take the kids!

2995
03:23:03,880 --> 03:23:07,560
They're gonna take the kids if I don't pay for my Scooby
Snacks.

2996
03:23:13,300 --> 03:23:13,580
Okay.

2997
03:23:15,380 --> 03:23:18,040
This reminds me of the infamous Crash Bandicoot Lover.

2998
03:23:19,520 --> 03:23:20,500
A bridge lover.

2999
03:23:26,500 --> 03:23:26,840
Okay.

3000
03:23:27,920 --> 03:23:29,780
That spot is close enough.

3001
03:23:31,700 --> 03:23:32,340
Okay.

3002
03:23:32,360 --> 03:23:33,760
It's close enough

3003
03:23:37,100 --> 03:23:43,780
Wait unless There is like three more down there Bro,

3004
03:23:47,850 --> 03:23:52,430
you gotta be like you gotta have like the reflexes of a
fucking adult to play this game.

3005
03:23:52,830 --> 03:23:53,890
I swear to God

3006
03:23:58,390 --> 03:24:04,330
The brain power and The IQ and the reflexes of an adult

3007
03:24:09,720 --> 03:24:12,080
No wonder I like never progressed.

3008
03:24:14,060 --> 03:24:16,020
No wonder I was stuck in that one area.

3009
03:24:16,640 --> 03:24:19,320
I literally only got to one area in this game.

3010
03:24:20,340 --> 03:24:22,560
But for some reason I still love the game.

3011
03:24:31,990 --> 03:24:32,670
Alright, there you go.

3012
03:24:33,910 --> 03:24:35,470
I got the monster token.

3013
03:24:40,930 --> 03:24:43,490
Alright, there has to be more Scooby Snacks back there.

3014
03:24:47,980 --> 03:24:50,080
Yeah, kids were definitely built different.

3015
03:24:53,520 --> 03:24:54,920
But, uh, pro, they give a super chat.

3016
03:24:54,960 --> 03:24:55,180
Thank you.

3017
03:24:56,940 --> 03:24:58,880
Yeah, kid meat had no chance.

3018
03:24:58,960 --> 03:24:59,600
Oh my god.

3019
03:25:00,480 --> 03:25:02,900
I forgot all about these boxes.

3020
03:25:05,040 --> 03:25:07,960
Guys, I forgot about these boxes, guys.

3021
03:25:11,180 --> 03:25:13,260
The pile is like, don't worry, guys.

3022
03:25:13,460 --> 03:25:17,120
I don't need to grab these snacks.

3023
03:25:17,140 --> 03:25:19,020
It'll be fine.

3024
03:25:21,860 --> 03:25:23,600
I will need them.

3025
03:25:24,400 --> 03:25:26,120
All these boxes.

3026
03:25:31,180 --> 03:25:31,920
Okay, we're close.

3027
03:25:37,990 --> 03:25:39,770
Wait, there's like one snack up there.

3028
03:25:41,510 --> 03:25:42,270
What's over here?

3029
03:25:45,030 --> 03:25:46,950
What is this open?

3030
03:25:49,290 --> 03:25:50,450
What the fuck did that open?

3031
03:25:51,690 --> 03:25:52,850
That stop out the box?

3032
03:25:52,970 --> 03:25:54,690
Oh, I stopped all the boxes.

3033
03:25:57,490 --> 03:25:59,290
Oh, you guys use Chico's.

3034
03:26:00,130 --> 03:26:00,490
Smart.

3035
03:26:02,170 --> 03:26:02,730
I didn't...

3036
03:26:02,730 --> 03:26:06,130
The only Chico's I ever used in a video game was for Heroes
of Might and Magic.

3037
03:26:06,830 --> 03:26:10,030
And for those who never played that game, it's just like
a...

3038
03:26:10,030 --> 03:26:13,030
I know, you're like, how were you playing that as a kid?

3039
03:26:13,850 --> 03:26:16,230
It was my dad's hand me, though, because he loved it.

3040
03:26:16,470 --> 03:26:18,670
And then he had, like, a little paper written.

3041
03:26:19,090 --> 03:26:22,950
Yeah, like, those, like, you know, the paper strat where you
write all the Chico's.

3042
03:26:22,970 --> 03:26:23,890
on a piece of paper.

3043
03:26:24,350 --> 03:26:25,110
So he had that.

3044
03:26:27,170 --> 03:26:28,090
He had that.

3045
03:26:28,230 --> 03:26:32,210
And he had all the cheats for heroes of might and magic
where he can just give like...

3046
03:26:32,210 --> 03:26:33,670
So there's like a...

3047
03:26:35,770 --> 03:26:42,150
So in the game, you're supposed to like build like it's like
a tactical thing, like a tactical game.

3048
03:26:42,290 --> 03:26:43,270
And you're supposed to...

3049
03:26:43,270 --> 03:26:44,370
Oh my god, how do I get that?

3050
03:26:44,790 --> 03:26:48,590
And they have that to build like a fucking army and stuff.

3051
03:26:49,190 --> 03:26:50,890
Each turn you're supposed to like...

3052
03:26:50,890 --> 03:26:51,850
How do I get up there?

3053
03:26:53,670 --> 03:27:02,150
you're supposed to like build up your army and then fight
other armies but then it's my dad instead of like building

3054
03:27:02,150 --> 03:27:11,730
an army he just goes he uses the strongest fucking unit as
for the cheat code which is just all angels and it literally

3055
03:27:11,730 --> 03:27:19,450
one-shots things and that's how you played the game he
literally oh my god how the fuck do i get the snack

3056
03:27:22,970 --> 03:27:23,750
This is the shadow.

3057
03:27:24,050 --> 03:27:24,810
This is the shadow.

3058
03:27:25,010 --> 03:27:25,730
Look, look, look, look, look.

3059
03:27:26,150 --> 03:27:26,930
Look, you can see it.

3060
03:27:27,190 --> 03:27:29,230
You can see the shadow right here.

3061
03:27:29,670 --> 03:27:30,030
Why?

3062
03:27:30,950 --> 03:27:30,950
Why?

3063
03:27:33,670 --> 03:27:34,030
Okay.

3064
03:27:35,130 --> 03:27:37,450
And it's just, it's just all angels.

3065
03:27:38,430 --> 03:27:40,450
I don't even remember the cheat code for it, but...

3066
03:27:42,330 --> 03:27:44,990
He did that and then he like...

3067
03:27:45,750 --> 03:27:50,090
And then he got bored of the game, so it was like a
hand-me-down to me, and then I start...

3068
03:27:50,090 --> 03:27:52,890
And he gave it to me to play with all the...

3069
03:27:52,970 --> 03:28:07,200
with all the chicas and everything how do i get that look at
all those snacks oh it's like this oh never mind i figured

3070
03:28:07,200 --> 03:28:20,660
it out who would have thought there's a thought about using
your 3d there's 3d in my 3d platformers guys that's crazy 3d

3071
03:28:20,660 --> 03:28:22,420

3072
03:28:26,300 --> 03:28:32,870
Okay, I'm almost there.

3073
03:28:35,530 --> 03:28:36,870
Oh my god, I'm so close to getting.

3074
03:28:38,250 --> 03:28:38,730
600.

3075
03:28:44,880 --> 03:28:47,620
Okay, this stupid fucking crab is in the way.

3076
03:28:50,780 --> 03:28:52,700
Oh my god, I have the umbrella here.

3077
03:28:52,780 --> 03:28:53,620
This would have been great.

3078
03:28:56,100 --> 03:28:57,060
We are close.

3079
03:28:57,620 --> 03:28:58,380
We're making it.

3080
03:28:58,420 --> 03:28:59,220
We're gonna make it.

3081
03:29:02,760 --> 03:29:03,320
Okay.

3082
03:29:09,010 --> 03:29:10,230
I'll grab these two.

3083
03:29:10,950 --> 03:29:12,030
Oh my god, just 20 more.

3084
03:29:13,590 --> 03:29:14,410
Just 20 more.

3085
03:29:16,350 --> 03:29:18,250
I can see the finish line.

3086
03:29:24,480 --> 03:29:28,200
Okay, I can only grab up these two because I don't have a
goddamn umbrella.

3087
03:29:37,480 --> 03:29:37,880
Okay.

3088
03:29:38,520 --> 03:29:40,300
I didn't go this way.

3089
03:29:40,860 --> 03:29:41,740
So maybe...

3090
03:29:41,740 --> 03:29:42,660
Whoa!

3091
03:29:44,440 --> 03:29:46,040

That's good.

3108
03:30:57,230 --> 03:30:58,330
I know now, though.

3109
03:31:00,170 --> 03:31:01,090
I know now.

3110
03:31:02,190 --> 03:31:03,270
He can bleed.

3111
03:31:05,150 --> 03:31:06,010
Okay, we don't need those.

3112
03:31:11,140 --> 03:31:11,480
It's okay.

3113
03:31:11,560 --> 03:31:12,580
We figured it out.

3114
03:31:13,600 --> 03:31:15,260
He can absolutely bleed.

3115
03:31:17,940 --> 03:31:19,160
Okay, but what's over here?

3116
03:31:19,360 --> 03:31:20,660
Bill's Boat Club.

3117
03:31:29,790 --> 03:31:31,530
Okay, we're just going here now.

3118
03:31:38,710 --> 03:31:39,990
Just full kill them.

3119
03:31:41,950 --> 03:31:44,650
We gotta get as much of the Scooby Snacks as we can.

3120
03:31:45,650 --> 03:31:48,010
We gotta rebuild the savings, guys.

3121
03:31:49,450 --> 03:31:49,930
Yummy.

3122
03:31:58,860 --> 03:32:00,060

3123
03:32:07,810 --> 03:32:10,030
Wait, this is back where I came from.

03:32:21,290 --> 03:32:21,570

03:32:24,430 --> 03:32:25,250

3128
03:32:25,570 --> 03:32:25,790
It's okay.

3129
03:32:25,830 --> 03:32:27,770
I wanted to be here because I wanted to.

3130
03:32:29,690 --> 03:32:31,010
Alright, we figured it out.

3131
03:32:33,790 --> 03:32:36,130
A Scooby Snack is a Scooby Snack, guys.

3132
03:32:37,730 --> 03:32:38,230
Whoa.

3133
03:32:38,810 --> 03:32:38,870

03:32:40,930 --> 03:32:43,210
Scooby-snack is a Scooby-snack.

3135
03:32:44,390 --> 03:32:46,430
Gotta take what we can get in this economy.

3136
03:32:50,580 --> 03:32:51,100
Alright.

3137
03:32:52,700 --> 03:32:53,600
It's okay.

3138
03:32:59,290 --> 03:33:01,810
Alright, then we can get back to...

3139
03:33:03,210 --> 03:33:04,370
It's this way, right?

3140
03:33:06,510 --> 03:33:09,570
Yeah, we want to go back to the Mystic Matter anyway.

3141
03:33:09,710 --> 03:33:10,170

3142
03:33:11,370 --> 03:33:12,870

03:37:43,950 --> 03:37:45,210
Oh, my God.

3195
03:37:45,370 --> 03:37:47,430
Okay, where do I have to backtrack now?

3196
03:37:48,010 --> 03:37:50,270
I'm so lost with all the backtracking.

3197
03:37:50,510 --> 03:37:51,750
I don't even know where I...

3198
03:37:51,750 --> 03:37:53,110
Okay, there's a door here.

3199
03:37:57,830 --> 03:37:58,470
Never mind.

3200
03:37:58,630 --> 03:37:59,370
I don't know where to go.

3201
03:37:59,610 --> 03:38:00,190
There's a door.

3202
03:38:02,130 --> 03:38:02,870
Oh, my God.

3203
03:38:02,930 --> 03:38:04,490
Not the goddamn swinging axe.

3204
03:38:05,610 --> 03:38:06,650
It's a classic.

3205
03:38:09,030 --> 03:38:13,290
Axe swinging Can I kill a ghost?

3206
03:38:16,990 --> 03:38:23,530
Oh no, I can't It's crazy, apparently you can't kill a ghost
What can you kill?

3207
03:38:23,930 --> 03:38:25,030
That's already undead

3208
03:38:35,120 --> 03:38:36,120
What's this?

3209
03:38:36,800 --> 03:38:46,700
You just found the Oh my god He invented plunges Okay, Steve
said Oh my god, what is this universe?

3210
03:38:46,960 --> 03:38:49,520
We didn't even have plungers until now?

3211
03:38:49,680 --> 03:38:49,840
What?

3212
03:38:53,860 --> 03:38:57,020
Every time you clog the toilet, you just gotta buy a new
toilet, guys.

3213
03:38:57,100 --> 03:38:57,780
This is that rough.

3214
03:38:58,060 --> 03:38:59,640
It was really up rough back then.

3215
03:38:59,840 --> 03:39:00,840
It was really...

3216
03:39:00,840 --> 03:39:02,120
That's crazy.

3217
03:39:02,520 --> 03:39:03,880
Guys, you don't understand.

3218
03:39:04,740 --> 03:39:11,100
Every time, every time you clogged up the toilet, it's just
too bad.

3219
03:39:11,320 --> 03:39:13,380
You gotta buy a new toilet, guys.

3220
03:39:15,020 --> 03:39:26,640
I'll make the rules Oh my god I have no bubble abilities
It's suction cup man I where do I go

3221
03:39:29,860 --> 03:39:41,280

3226
03:40:27,070 --> 03:40:28,410
When did that happen?

3227
03:40:34,090 --> 03:40:36,370
I'm in the dungeon now.

3228
03:40:43,750 --> 03:40:44,610
That's fine.

3229
03:40:44,910 --> 03:40:45,710
I do it this way.

3230
03:40:51,050 --> 03:40:51,970
Okay, it's fine.

3231
03:40:51,990 --> 03:40:52,690
It's just a pit.

3232
03:40:52,870 --> 03:40:54,970
It's just just the endless pit.

3233
03:40:59,230 --> 03:41:01,450
I mean, maybe there's like...

3234
03:41:05,230 --> 03:41:07,070
We're gonna try and find the teleporter.

3235
03:41:16,800 --> 03:41:19,540

3240
03:41:28,200 --> 03:41:29,240

3258
03:43:43,370 --> 03:43:46,070

Okay, I got double for that to full kill the crab.

3262
03:44:00,050 --> 03:44:00,510
There you go.

3263

And I get kicked!

3264
03:44:01,290 --> 03:44:01,650
Yeah!

3265
03:44:03,570 --> 03:44:04,930
Okay, what is this open?

3266
03:44:05,230 --> 03:44:06,690
Okay, that opens that.

3267
03:44:06,770 --> 03:44:12,810
And then now I have to backtrack all the way to the other
side of this goddamn hill.

3268
03:44:14,850 --> 03:44:15,350
I'm Doki.

3269
03:44:15,890 --> 03:44:16,910
Actually, it's called Cliff.

3270
03:44:19,330 --> 03:44:20,130
Oh my god.

3271
03:44:20,770 --> 03:44:22,270
Back to the other side now.

3272
03:44:32,950 --> 03:44:34,890
Now I figure out how to get down there.

3273
03:44:39,950 --> 03:44:41,370
And grab the Scooby Snack.

3274
03:44:41,570 --> 03:44:41,950
Oh my god.

3275
03:44:42,050 --> 03:44:42,550
I'm rebuilding.

3276
03:44:43,230 --> 03:44:43,810
220.

3277
03:44:50,350 --> 03:44:51,350
That's fine.

3278
03:44:53,010 --> 03:44:54,070
That's fine.

3279
03:44:54,950 --> 03:44:56,250
I will say.

3280
03:44:56,530 --> 03:44:58,430
Why did the Scooby Snack?

3281
03:44:58,970 --> 03:45:01,270
led to the fucking abyss.

3282
03:45:02,570 --> 03:45:03,270
No, no, no, no.

3283
03:45:03,370 --> 03:45:06,150
We all saw the Scooby Snacks, guys.

3284
03:45:07,790 --> 03:45:08,470
Oh, my God.

3285
03:45:08,810 --> 03:45:09,290
Oh, my God.

3286
03:45:09,430 --> 03:45:10,130
I have to do a button again.

3287
03:45:10,390 --> 03:45:11,430
I have to do that button.

3288
03:45:11,730 --> 03:45:15,590
The Scooby Snack led us all the way down.

3289
03:45:15,750 --> 03:45:16,770
It was like, jump this way.

3290
03:45:16,830 --> 03:45:18,650
I was like, oh, okay, maybe it's another pathway.

3291
03:45:19,750 --> 03:45:20,210
Oh, my God.

3292
03:45:20,230 --> 03:45:21,490
I have to push that button again.

3293
03:45:28,250 --> 03:45:29,830
Test of your greed.

3294
03:45:33,590 --> 03:45:36,630
It was truly the final test.

3295
03:45:42,390 --> 03:45:44,990
Yeah, we need that sandwich anyway.

3296
03:45:49,910 --> 03:45:51,010
Oh my god.

3297
03:45:52,190 --> 03:45:53,850
That's actually so bullshit.

3298
03:45:57,390 --> 03:45:58,630
Alright, here we go.

3299
03:46:00,650 --> 03:46:01,610
I definitely...

3300
03:46:01,610 --> 03:46:04,210
There was no way Kid Doki was figuring any of this out.

3301
03:46:04,550 --> 03:46:05,150
There was no...

3302
03:46:05,710 --> 03:46:06,830
There was no way...

3303
03:46:12,910 --> 03:46:15,370
Oh my god, I almost jumped off again.

3304
03:46:16,210 --> 03:46:17,110
Oh my god.

3305
03:46:18,830 --> 03:46:20,090
Okay, we wait.

3306
03:46:25,070 --> 03:46:25,910
There we go, we wait.

3307
03:46:30,980 --> 03:46:31,360
There we go.

3308
03:46:31,620 --> 03:46:32,680
We made it.

3309
03:46:33,400 --> 03:46:33,640
Enter.

3310
03:46:34,240 --> 03:46:36,300
I know it says do not enter, but we enter.

3311
03:46:41,760 --> 03:46:42,180
Whoops.

3312
03:46:43,780 --> 03:46:44,140
Alright, nice.

3313
03:46:44,240 --> 03:46:44,560
Free cake.

3314
03:46:47,980 --> 03:46:59,560
okay there has to be like a pathway there that hasn't
spawned in yet because i have to press a goddamn button okay

3318
03:47:52,910 --> 03:47:55,990
Yeah, I might need like 600 cookies or some shit.

3319
03:47:59,090 --> 03:48:00,130
Most likely.

3320
03:48:00,990 --> 03:48:02,790
For the next cookie spot.

3321
03:48:07,090 --> 03:48:09,410
Oh, we made it.

3322
03:48:10,430 --> 03:48:11,970
Oh, there's a goddamn...

3323
03:48:11,970 --> 03:48:12,610
I see you.

3324
03:48:13,930 --> 03:48:15,190
God damn it, no umbrellas.

3325
03:48:16,970 --> 03:48:18,090
The world is so cruel.

3326
03:48:18,970 --> 03:48:20,690
The Scooby-Doo world is so cruel.

3327
03:48:23,690 --> 03:48:32,010
and someone please start inventing things again was there
like a law like scientists are forbidden to invent stuff is

3328
03:48:32,010 --> 03:48:43,950
that why we don't have blunders umbrellas and fucking rain
boots it's a crime it's a crannly crime when it's raining

3329
03:48:43,950 --> 03:48:46,250
you just gotta toughen it out with wet shoes

3330
03:48:53,060 --> 03:48:54,940
Yes, I can't believe it's a crime.

3331
03:48:58,480 --> 03:48:59,740
The other side.

3332
03:49:00,540 --> 03:49:03,100
You're too busy inventing ghost costumes.

3333
03:49:11,850 --> 03:49:12,290
How do I?

3334
03:49:13,510 --> 03:49:15,070
How do I get...

3335
03:49:15,070 --> 03:49:16,570
Oh my god, it was up top.

3336
03:49:16,750 --> 03:49:17,110
It was...

3337
03:49:17,870 --> 03:49:20,570
I was like, where's the platform?

3338
03:49:21,150 --> 03:49:23,510
Of course the platform was up top.

3339
03:49:26,290 --> 03:49:26,810
Right?

3340
03:49:28,330 --> 03:49:29,010
Nice.

3341
03:49:29,790 --> 03:49:30,590
Cake time.

3342
03:49:37,070 --> 03:49:37,330
Okay.

3343
03:49:43,230 --> 03:49:43,730
Alright.

3344
03:49:44,510 --> 03:49:46,170
This place is so dangerous.

3345
03:49:48,070 --> 03:49:48,870
No wonder no one.

3346
03:49:49,090 --> 03:49:51,570
No wonder only one person lives up here.

3347
03:49:55,030 --> 03:49:55,590
What's over here?

3348
03:49:58,870 --> 03:49:59,550
Okay.

3349
03:50:00,710 --> 03:50:02,350
I gotta find a button!

3350
03:50:05,730 --> 03:50:06,410
Okay.

3351
03:50:07,590 --> 03:50:08,150
No!

3352
03:50:08,410 --> 03:50:08,590
No!

3353
03:50:10,830 --> 03:50:12,350
Oh my god.

3354
03:50:12,510 --> 03:50:14,450
No, I'm all the way back here.

3355
03:50:14,870 --> 03:50:15,250
No!

3356
03:50:17,650 --> 03:50:18,550
Oh my god.

3357
03:50:19,090 --> 03:50:20,190
So I was talking about crossovers.

3358
03:50:20,390 --> 03:50:22,910
I think my favorite Scooby-Doo crossover was with
Supernatural.

3359
03:50:23,450 --> 03:50:28,650
That's crazy that they were able to get Scooby-Doo, like,
Wonder Brothers to agree to that.

3360
03:50:29,710 --> 03:50:30,910
Scooby-Doo is Wonder Brothers, right?

3361
03:50:42,560 --> 03:50:49,920
But the Scooby-Doo, because it's crazy because, like, Um,
you know how they're like, Velma's like, ghosts aren't

3362
03:50:49,920 --> 03:50:51,440
silly, ghosts aren't real.

3363
03:50:52,160 --> 03:50:55,100
Like, that's just a guy pretending to play dead.

3364
03:50:55,620 --> 03:50:58,180
And then it's literally a dead man in the bed.

3365
03:50:58,540 --> 03:51:02,640
And she, like, touches like, oh my god, it's a real dead
body.

3366
03:51:02,880 --> 03:51:05,720
And then they all start screaming and be like, oh my god.

3367
03:51:07,760 --> 03:51:08,620
Ghosts are real.

3368
03:51:08,820 --> 03:51:12,760
Like, it literally, literally blew the Scooby-Doo gang's
mind.

3369
03:51:12,920 --> 03:51:16,420
They're like, wait, they're like, what?

3370
03:51:16,440 --> 03:51:24,040
Ghost turned real though And then Velma had like a fucking
nervous breakdown Cause like Everything she knew was a

3371
03:51:24,040 --> 03:51:29,580
fucking lie Like It was a really good episode

3372
03:51:35,410 --> 03:51:42,850
And then it's like the Scooby-Doo gang Like found an actual
real dead body And like Jackie has a fucking panic attack

3373
03:51:42,850 --> 03:51:52,850
Cause he's like That's oh god Zoic system is he's dead Yeah
got to yeah and then and a shaggy breaks an arm and he's

3374
03:51:52,850 --> 03:52:02,430
like wait because like um physics exists now because they do
a crossover with supernatural so then physics exists and a

3375
03:52:02,430 --> 03:52:09,270
shaggy breaks his arm and he's like what this never happens
before he's

3376
03:52:13,230 --> 03:52:19,730
like i've done this i've never broken an arm before how is
this possible

3377
03:52:23,310 --> 03:52:25,490
How many physics exists now?

3378
03:52:25,910 --> 03:52:27,610
Their whole world blew up.

3379
03:52:36,700 --> 03:52:40,780
Oh yeah, and John Cena exists in the Supernatural, in the
Scooby-Doo lore.

3380
03:52:41,400 --> 03:52:42,360
He's a real person.

3381
03:52:42,480 --> 03:52:45,180
Because back then, they used to do crossovers with real
people.

3382
03:52:45,380 --> 03:52:47,500
Oh my god.

3383
03:52:47,780 --> 03:52:51,380
So like, John Cena exists in the Scooby-Doo land.

3384
03:52:51,940 --> 03:52:53,140
The Scooby-Doo universe.

3385
03:53:04,950 --> 03:53:06,350
Yeah, he like jumps out.

3386
03:53:07,010 --> 03:53:09,270
He's like, he's like, I feel like.

3387
03:53:09,290 --> 03:53:12,130
jumped out of a plane before and this never happened.

3388
03:53:16,370 --> 03:53:19,390
But yeah, I jump out of a window and I break arm?

3389
03:53:19,750 --> 03:53:20,030
Question mark?

3390
03:53:20,350 --> 03:53:20,610
Question mark?

3391
03:53:20,910 --> 03:53:21,270
Question mark?

3392
03:53:21,690 --> 03:53:25,470
Oh my god, that was crazy.

3393
03:53:25,810 --> 03:53:29,810
Like, it actually, like, I got an eye frame in the water.

3394
03:53:36,090 --> 03:53:37,250
Wait, I gotta get 600.

3395
03:53:43,250 --> 03:53:44,670
Wait, it's back here?

3396
03:53:44,850 --> 03:53:45,170
Wait, there was...

3397
03:53:45,190 --> 03:53:46,210
It was like an island.

3398
03:53:49,790 --> 03:53:50,030
Here.

3399
03:53:50,130 --> 03:53:51,550
How the fuck do I get to the island?

3400
03:53:55,050 --> 03:53:56,070
Oh my god.

3401
03:53:56,230 --> 03:53:56,470
Like how?

3402
03:53:56,630 --> 03:53:58,910
How do I know which one's the island area?

3403
03:54:00,950 --> 03:54:03,170
Wait, it's the water coming back up.

3404
03:54:04,530 --> 03:54:06,050
Guys, the water's coming back up.

3405
03:54:06,250 --> 03:54:07,550
The water came back.

03:54:11,010 --> 03:54:14,050
Okay, where does the fucking...

03:54:14,050 --> 03:54:15,170

I know it's Smuggles Cobra.

3418
03:55:11,390 --> 03:55:13,270
I left a lot of Scooby Snacks.

3419
03:55:15,350 --> 03:55:16,150
Maybe here?

3420
03:55:22,670 --> 03:55:23,770
Yeah, it's here.

3421
03:55:27,190 --> 03:55:27,870
Okay.

3422
03:55:31,130 --> 03:55:32,490
We gotta...

3423
03:55:32,490 --> 03:55:34,870
We gotta grab the tiny ones now.

3424
03:55:39,610 --> 03:55:40,250
It's here.

3425
03:55:44,490 --> 03:55:45,930
Oh my god.

3426
03:55:46,050 --> 03:55:47,870
I have to grab the tiny ones too.

3427
03:55:47,970 --> 03:55:48,890
I'm so poor.

3428
03:55:50,050 --> 03:55:51,350
What the fuck?

3429
03:55:58,410 --> 03:56:00,570
How the fuck do I get up there?

3430
03:56:07,720 --> 03:56:08,700
Like, what?

3431
03:56:09,120 --> 03:56:10,840
Okay, there's no way I'm getting over there.

3432
03:56:15,970 --> 03:56:17,710
God, I'm just like, I'm digging through that.

3433
03:56:22,570 --> 03:56:23,290
Oh, no.

3434
03:56:23,370 --> 03:56:25,210
I have to do this parkour shit, too.

3435
03:56:25,870 --> 03:56:27,130
All over again.

3436
03:56:27,490 --> 03:56:28,190
Oh, my God.

3437
03:56:28,270 --> 03:56:29,390
There's so many snacks over there.

3438
03:56:29,470 --> 03:56:30,170
There's so many.

3439
03:56:30,250 --> 03:56:31,230
I saw so many snacks over there.

3440
03:56:31,350 --> 03:56:32,930
I saw, like, the fucking problem is that.

3441
03:56:37,580 --> 03:56:38,420
Oh, my God.

3442
03:56:38,520 --> 03:56:40,820
All these snacks I overlooked.

3443
03:56:41,080 --> 03:56:43,780
Because I thought I thought I was better than this.

3444
03:56:43,800 --> 03:56:45,780
But I was wrong!

3445
03:56:48,240 --> 03:56:50,320
No one is better than this.

3446
03:56:52,800 --> 03:56:54,280
I was wrong.

3447
03:56:55,020 --> 03:56:56,620
I wasn't better than this.

3448
03:57:04,270 --> 03:57:04,910
All right.

3449
03:57:13,370 --> 03:57:13,990
Okay.

3450
03:57:19,810 --> 03:57:20,590
What the fuck?

3451
03:57:20,690 --> 03:57:21,810
How do I get over there?

3452
03:57:24,830 --> 03:57:27,170
Every Scooby-Doo snack counts.

3453
03:57:28,710 --> 03:57:29,390
God damn it.

3454
03:57:34,160 --> 03:57:36,520
I don't know where else to get Scooby snacks now.

3455
03:57:39,860 --> 03:57:40,200
Fuck.

3456
03:57:45,290 --> 03:57:46,230
Alright, we're going back.

3457
03:57:47,790 --> 03:57:49,070
We're going to start all the way back.

3458
03:57:50,370 --> 03:57:52,310
Yeah, no, we played the picnic game.

3459
03:57:52,630 --> 03:57:53,810
I'm on stream too.

3460
03:57:55,210 --> 03:57:56,590
Oh my god, it's all the way back.

3461
03:57:56,950 --> 03:57:58,390
It's all the way back there.

3462
03:57:58,470 --> 03:58:00,350
Okay, there might be Scooby snacks though, guys.

3463
03:58:00,550 --> 03:58:03,230
There might be Scooby Snacks all the way back.

3464
03:58:05,110 --> 03:58:06,630
We gotta go back.

3465
03:58:08,850 --> 03:58:09,550
It's okay.

3466
03:58:09,730 --> 03:58:09,970
It's okay.

3467
03:58:10,190 --> 03:58:10,630
Just a little...

3468
03:58:13,050 --> 03:58:15,450
A little unforced trauma doesn't hurt anyone.

3469
03:58:20,850 --> 03:58:21,610
God damn it.

3470
03:58:21,930 --> 03:58:22,910
Oh no, I'm one.

3471
03:58:24,110 --> 03:58:25,130
I'm one away.

3472
03:58:26,170 --> 03:58:27,250
This has to be the door.

3473
03:58:28,990 --> 03:58:29,410
Oh, thank God.

3474
03:58:29,550 --> 03:58:29,970
That's the door.

3475
03:58:32,250 --> 03:58:45,870
coast for some ghosts oh my god it's here it's here I went
so far back that's it I have to use the bathroom I'll be

3476
03:58:45,870 --> 03:58:48,190
right back guys go enjoy some Scooby Doo

3477
04:01:33,120 --> 04:01:36,240
I'm going to vacuum my floors after the stream.

3478
04:01:36,560 --> 04:01:37,440
I cleaned a little bit.

3479
04:01:37,560 --> 04:01:47,100
I accidentally, when I went to the bathroom, I hit my hand
on the tray that had the sushi, and it flipped over and the

3480
04:01:47,100 --> 04:01:47,920
lid came off.

3481
04:01:48,400 --> 04:01:50,140
So like, I did clean a bit.

3482
04:01:50,980 --> 04:01:55,680
I cleaned a bit with some tissues, but I'm going to get a
vacuum.

3483
04:01:56,540 --> 04:01:57,620
And a towel later.

3484
04:01:58,500 --> 04:01:58,700
Yeah.

3485
04:01:59,680 --> 04:02:01,040
I don't think a lot spilled, though.

3486
04:02:02,420 --> 04:02:03,740
Not a lot spilled out.

3487
04:02:04,380 --> 04:02:05,580
I finished the sushi.

3488
04:02:05,760 --> 04:02:07,840
It was just from the soy sauce.

3489
04:02:08,500 --> 04:02:10,900
Like the soy sauce and the...

3490
04:02:10,900 --> 04:02:11,620
And stuff.

3491
04:02:11,680 --> 04:02:14,200
So I just have to, like, vacuum a bit.

3492
04:02:14,340 --> 04:02:15,280
And then, like...

3493
04:02:16,300 --> 04:02:17,680
Get a towel or something.

3494
04:02:20,600 --> 04:02:21,080
Yeah.

3495
04:02:22,840 --> 04:02:24,560
No, I went, like, on my desk.

3496
04:02:24,860 --> 04:02:25,840
My PC desk.

3497
04:02:30,870 --> 04:02:32,990
Oh my god, this is hell.

3498
04:02:36,370 --> 04:02:37,950
The backtrack of the century.

3499
04:02:38,450 --> 04:02:39,270
I still...

3500
04:02:39,270 --> 04:02:41,490
Oh my god, I swear to god.

3501
04:02:42,210 --> 04:02:42,750
They...

3502
04:02:43,950 --> 04:02:46,570
They made this to fuck with people.

3503
04:02:47,330 --> 04:02:47,690
They...

3504
04:02:48,050 --> 04:02:49,590
I swear to god.

3505
04:02:50,610 --> 04:02:52,330
They made that to fuck with you.

3506
04:02:52,330 --> 04:02:54,850
You're not supposed to be able to grab that Scooby Stack.

3507
04:02:56,250 --> 04:02:57,630
There's no way.

3508
04:02:58,230 --> 04:03:00,090
That Scooby Stack is unattainable.

3509
04:03:01,450 --> 04:03:05,530
No, just for any particles.

3510
04:03:05,850 --> 04:03:09,170
I want to grab the vacuum for any of the particles that, no.

3511
04:03:10,170 --> 04:03:11,070
Because I can't tell.

3512
04:03:14,110 --> 04:03:15,070
That's evil.

3513
04:03:15,330 --> 04:03:16,390
That's so evil.

3514
04:03:16,970 --> 04:03:22,810
I think I'm walking, I'm backtracking so far back to, like,
the original fishing place that I was at.

3515
04:03:26,280 --> 04:03:27,580
You know what game I really want to play?

3516
04:03:29,140 --> 04:03:31,160
I really want to play...

3517
04:03:32,480 --> 04:03:33,800
Where does this go again?

3518
04:03:33,900 --> 04:03:35,380
Oh, my God, it's all the way back there.

3519
04:03:35,520 --> 04:03:36,060
I remember that.

3520
04:03:38,000 --> 04:03:39,120
Was, what is it called?

3521
04:03:39,180 --> 04:03:51,040
The one where Nickelodeon did a huge crossover with Jimmy
Neutron, Danny Phantom, Timmy Turner, and SpongeBob.

3522
04:03:51,980 --> 04:03:53,280
I forgot what those games they're called.

3523
04:03:53,400 --> 04:03:56,240
I heard they were, I remember playing the first one, and
they were really fun.

3524
04:03:56,320 --> 04:03:57,020
I'm going all the way back.

3525
04:03:57,160 --> 04:03:57,500
Fuck this.

3526
04:03:59,680 --> 04:04:00,400
Nick, what's it called?

3527
04:04:00,720 --> 04:04:01,120
Nicktoons?

3528
04:04:05,030 --> 04:04:15,290
I don't know where to go I don't know I don't know where am

3531
04:04:37,110 --> 04:04:39,490
Not the Mystic Manor.

3532
04:04:41,430 --> 04:04:45,090
Was it the Mystic Manor where I got the boots?

3533
04:04:51,020 --> 04:04:53,340
Not the Mystic Manor.

3534
04:04:54,440 --> 04:04:55,880
I didn't know.

3535
04:04:56,380 --> 04:04:58,660
I thought I was so rich.

3536
04:05:08,990 --> 04:05:13,510
I thought I was fucking rolling in Scooby Snacks, guys.

3537
04:05:14,710 --> 04:05:17,610
How is I supposed to know?

3538
04:05:19,330 --> 04:05:21,990
The market was this bad.

3539
04:05:26,190 --> 04:05:26,550
Okay.

3540
04:05:30,470 --> 04:05:33,630
I didn't know the market became this terrible.

3541
04:05:38,830 --> 04:05:41,270
Oh my god, there has to be.

3542
04:05:42,770 --> 04:05:44,090
Oh, it's okay, it's just one.

3543
04:05:44,650 --> 04:05:45,430
It's Doki, they start.

3544
04:05:45,610 --> 04:05:45,990
It's just one.

3545
04:05:46,370 --> 04:05:47,450
It's just one.

3546
04:05:50,730 --> 04:05:52,130
Doesn't add up.

3547
04:05:58,630 --> 04:05:59,070
Okay.

3548
04:05:59,850 --> 04:06:00,450
It's fine.

3549
04:06:05,860 --> 04:06:06,760
Oh, my God.

3550
04:06:06,860 --> 04:06:09,860
There has to be a Scooby Snack somewhere.

3551
04:06:14,880 --> 04:06:15,400
Okay, there you go.

3552
04:06:15,500 --> 04:06:15,860
There you go.

3553
04:06:15,980 --> 04:06:16,920
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

3554
04:06:17,980 --> 04:06:22,020
We invented... We invented plungers in the universe now.

3555
04:06:28,470 --> 04:06:31,510
Okay, there is one.

3556
04:06:33,710 --> 04:06:34,010
Okay.

3557
04:06:34,630 --> 04:06:36,910
All right.

3558
04:06:41,550 --> 04:06:41,630
It's 550.

3559
04:06:41,810 --> 04:06:42,450
We're so close.

3560
04:06:42,590 --> 04:06:43,470
We're almost there.

3561
04:06:45,230 --> 04:06:46,770
We're actually so close.

3562
04:06:47,190 --> 04:06:48,590
I can see the finish line.

3563
04:06:49,750 --> 04:06:51,130
It was 550, right?

3564
04:06:51,230 --> 04:06:51,990
Or was it 600?

3565
04:06:52,150 --> 04:06:52,450
I can't.

3566
04:06:52,530 --> 04:06:53,250
I don't remember.

3567
04:06:53,950 --> 04:06:56,130
I know so many Scooby snacks.

3568
04:07:02,570 --> 04:07:06,830
I have to get so many scooby snacks.

3569
04:07:07,930 --> 04:07:10,050
The economy is so brutal.

3570
04:07:13,750 --> 04:07:15,130
There's one over here.

3571
04:07:19,880 --> 04:07:21,320
All right.

3572
04:07:29,170 --> 04:07:29,710
It's fine.

3573
04:07:30,070 --> 04:07:30,850
Wait, is this lit?

3574
04:07:31,750 --> 04:07:34,150
No, okay, it's just a regular platform.

3575
04:07:34,760 --> 04:07:36,370
Come on, go up.

3576
04:07:42,290 --> 04:07:44,790
Okay, 522, we're making it.

3577
04:07:44,890 --> 04:07:45,900
We're gonna make it.

3578
04:07:46,950 --> 04:07:47,690
Scooby.

04:07:49,270 --> 04:07:51,380
Oh my god, wait.

3580
04:07:54,450 --> 04:07:55,910
Everyone counts.

3581
04:07:57,310 --> 04:07:58,430
Everyone counts.

3582
04:07:59,290 --> 04:08:01,250
Every single Scooby snack.

3583
04:08:01,790 --> 04:08:03,130
Is there any more up here?

3584
04:08:05,870 --> 04:08:06,990
Oh my god, what's that?

3585
04:08:07,090 --> 04:08:08,050
No, that's just soap.

3586
04:08:10,110 --> 04:08:11,030
That's just soap.

3587
04:08:15,870 --> 04:08:16,790
Maybe that's the last...

3588
04:08:16,790 --> 04:08:18,710
Guys, maybe that's the last room.

3589
04:08:21,910 --> 04:08:22,270
Guys.

3590
04:08:23,610 --> 04:08:24,130
No!

3591
04:08:27,870 --> 04:08:28,390
Okay.

3592
04:08:28,810 --> 04:08:29,310
It's okay.

3593
04:08:29,390 --> 04:08:33,250
I wanted to be down here so I can grab more Scooby Snack.

3594
04:08:33,490 --> 04:08:33,870
Yes.

3595
04:08:37,930 --> 04:08:40,230
It baited me so hard.

3596
04:08:42,050 --> 04:08:44,110
My god, that's a big scooby snack.

3597
04:08:44,630 --> 04:08:46,210
Oh my god, I'm making it.

3598
04:08:46,210 --> 04:08:49,510
Oh no, it's a wrong way.

3599
04:08:56,000 --> 04:08:57,480
What the fuck?

3600
04:08:57,880 --> 04:08:59,020
Okay, it's like a huge bait.

3601
04:08:59,160 --> 04:09:01,040
Like, there's no way I can get there.

3602
04:09:02,140 --> 04:09:03,040
There was no way.

3603
04:09:03,460 --> 04:09:03,900
No.

3604
04:09:10,620 --> 04:09:11,260
Okay.

That's fine.

3607
04:09:19,330 --> 04:09:20,710
I can slam dunk a witch.

3608
04:09:29,150 --> 04:09:29,930
We're here.

3609
04:09:29,990 --> 04:09:31,270
Okay, there's a portal here.

3610
04:09:34,110 --> 04:09:35,110
It's fine.

3611
04:09:35,450 --> 04:09:36,010
It's fine.

3612
04:09:36,510 --> 04:09:37,890
There's a portal next to me.

3613
04:09:38,630 --> 04:09:38,870
Okay.

3614
04:09:39,230 --> 04:09:40,010

04:10:06,710 --> 04:10:08,750

I'm doing it too fast.

3743
04:19:11,040 --> 04:19:12,100
I've just have to wait a little.

3744
04:19:13,560 --> 04:19:13,960

04:19:59,380 --> 04:20:00,040
Okay, I'm just gonna wait.

3754
04:20:11,110 --> 04:20:11,570

Sonic Enhancement for the Super Smash.

3757
04:20:20,290 --> 04:20:22,330
You have a Super Smash and a Gravo stun nearby.

3758
04:20:22,510 --> 04:20:22,970
Oh, okay.

3759
04:20:23,070 --> 04:20:23,870

3760
04:20:23,970 --> 04:20:25,210
I remember we're killing them.

3761
04:20:25,770 --> 04:20:27,550

3762
04:20:29,250 --> 04:20:29,530

Hot buff paths high and low.

600.

3850
04:26:32,870 --> 04:26:33,930

3852
04:26:37,930 --> 04:26:39,890
That's so odd.

3853
04:26:43,910 --> 04:26:44,730
It's good.

3854
04:26:44,830 --> 04:26:46,050

04:31:47,990 --> 04:31:50,350
Okay, I need to figure out how to get to the other side

3913
04:31:55,330 --> 04:32:06,970
Okay, oh my god, there it is Oh my god, there's Scooby
Snacks There it is Guys, how many do I need, guys?

3914
04:32:07,410 --> 04:32:08,450
Oh my god.

3915
04:32:09,190 --> 04:32:09,650
Why?

3916
04:32:11,030 --> 04:32:12,150
I took advantage.

3917
04:32:12,310 --> 04:32:14,690
There were so many snacks just lying around.

3918
04:32:16,410 --> 04:32:18,030
I took them for granted.

3919
04:32:20,690 --> 04:32:23,430
I took these Scooby snacks for granted.

3920
04:32:23,610 --> 04:32:24,590
I didn't know.

3921
04:32:26,530 --> 04:32:29,650
I didn't know what I lost until now.

3922
04:32:35,600 --> 04:32:36,620
Poopy snacks.

3923
04:32:38,400 --> 04:32:39,780
Oh my god, this is hell.

3924
04:32:39,900 --> 04:32:40,980
This is such a tight jump.

3925
04:32:50,170 --> 04:32:51,670
God, this jump is so tight.

3926
04:32:52,850 --> 04:32:53,070
Okay.

3927
04:32:56,890 --> 04:32:57,330
Alright.

3928
04:33:00,210 --> 04:33:01,230
Oh, you fucking kidding me.

3929
04:33:01,270 --> 04:33:01,870
Okay, it's fine.

3930
04:33:05,190 --> 04:33:06,830
Got every snack counts.

3931
04:33:09,670 --> 04:33:12,670
This tests my fucking perception right here.

3932
04:33:14,670 --> 04:33:15,310
That's fine.

3933
04:33:15,470 --> 04:33:15,690
That's fine.

3934
04:33:16,410 --> 04:33:17,390
It's fine, guys.

3935
04:33:17,470 --> 04:33:18,050
It's fine.

3936
04:33:18,890 --> 04:33:22,270
Every snack count except for that particular snack, guys.

3937
04:33:24,450 --> 04:33:25,050
It's okay.

3938
04:33:25,250 --> 04:33:26,350
That snack...

3939
04:33:26,350 --> 04:33:28,790
Every snack counts except for that one.

3940
04:33:31,190 --> 04:33:32,570
Just that one, guys.

3941
04:33:32,810 --> 04:33:33,230
It's fine.

3942
04:33:35,890 --> 04:33:36,850
Where do I go?

3943
04:33:39,490 --> 04:33:41,670
Where the fuck is the door for those here?

3944
04:33:45,490 --> 04:33:46,170
Right!

3945
04:33:49,870 --> 04:33:50,390
Gulp.

3946
04:33:54,930 --> 04:33:55,390
Alright.

3947
04:33:57,050 --> 04:33:57,850
No, it's okay.

3948
04:33:57,910 --> 04:33:58,470
It's just three.

3949
04:33:58,590 --> 04:33:59,910
It's just three snacks.

3950
04:34:01,870 --> 04:34:03,290
It's only three.

3951
04:34:04,370 --> 04:34:05,050
It's five.

3952
04:34:09,460 --> 04:34:11,160
Those three don't add up.

3953
04:34:19,260 --> 04:34:19,860
I remember this.

3954
04:34:20,020 --> 04:34:21,060
I grabbed these snacks already.

3955
04:34:21,400 --> 04:34:22,240
Yeah, I grabbed them.

3956
04:34:22,780 --> 04:34:25,060
Well, I remember someone said the map tells you how many I'm
missing.

3957
04:34:26,800 --> 04:34:28,280
289 out of 300.

3958
04:34:28,300 --> 04:34:30,260
Where the...

3959
04:34:30,260 --> 04:34:31,700
Oh, it's the entire...

3960
04:34:31,700 --> 04:34:33,180
Okay, where...

3961
04:34:33,180 --> 04:34:38,720
Where is this 344 2 that they are speaking of?

3962
04:34:41,000 --> 04:34:42,620
Like, where...

3963
04:34:42,620 --> 04:34:45,600
Can it please stand up?

3964
04:34:47,850 --> 04:34:51,320
I think I think it's gonna add up.

3965
04:34:55,220 --> 04:34:58,220
Tokey, maybe it's adding up, Tokey.

3966
04:34:58,920 --> 04:34:59,860
No, no, no.

3967
04:34:59,980 --> 04:35:01,380
It's not adding up, guys.

3968
04:35:06,450 --> 04:35:09,110
Well, we know where three of them is.

3969
04:35:10,010 --> 04:35:13,530
No, that's impossible.

3970
04:35:16,870 --> 04:35:17,170
Oh, my God.

3971
04:35:17,350 --> 04:35:17,570
There's two.

3972
04:35:17,730 --> 04:35:18,210
There's one here.

3973
04:35:18,310 --> 04:35:19,150
I remember now.

3974
04:35:27,280 --> 04:35:27,900
A 400.

3975
04:35:31,880 --> 04:35:32,420
All right.

3976
04:35:32,680 --> 04:35:33,360
This is good.

3977
04:35:33,840 --> 04:35:34,460
It's good.

3978
04:35:34,820 --> 04:35:35,820
We're 100 left.

3979
04:35:43,270 --> 04:35:44,470
Okay, we're getting there.

3980
04:35:45,810 --> 04:35:45,890

3981
04:35:46,030 --> 04:35:47,130
80 to go.

3982
04:35:50,970 --> 04:35:52,670
Okay, there's a door here.

3983
04:35:56,210 --> 04:35:57,090
Oh, my God.

3984
04:35:57,250 --> 04:35:57,890
It's this area.

3985
04:35:59,650 --> 04:36:00,790
How do I... Okay, there you go.

3986
04:36:00,870 --> 04:36:03,130
I was going to say, how the fuck do I charge this?

3987
04:36:10,510 --> 04:36:10,950
Okay.

3988
04:36:12,490 --> 04:36:13,750
See, I told you guys.

3989
04:36:13,890 --> 04:36:14,270

04:37:22,650 --> 04:37:36,750

The warp gate is up here.

Okay, here we go.

4002
04:38:01,560 --> 04:38:07,120
We go to the warp gate, and then we go down here, and then
we go down.

04:39:00,090 --> 04:39:02,010
They were in my pathway!

4011
04:39:04,970 --> 04:39:07,010
It adds up.

4012
04:39:07,370 --> 04:39:11,590
It really did end up adding up.

4013
04:39:12,490 --> 04:39:13,970
How could this happen?

4014
04:39:16,350 --> 04:39:19,270
What do you mean it adds up?

4015
04:39:23,970 --> 04:39:24,750
Right!

4016
04:39:25,330 --> 04:39:26,650
It's a headless factor!

4017
04:39:28,550 --> 04:39:30,530
Oh my god, I haven't even hit 600 yet.

4018
04:39:30,710 --> 04:39:32,890
The fact that I haven't even hit 600.

4019
04:39:39,040 --> 04:39:40,620
Okay, there's the carpet.

4020
04:39:49,650 --> 04:39:52,630
Yeah, I know I don't need to collect all of it, but I need
600.

4021
04:39:55,170 --> 04:39:56,590
Guys, that's the thing.

4022
04:39:57,510 --> 04:40:01,270
We need 600 to even progress.

4023
04:40:11,340 --> 04:40:12,780
We'll head down the roof a bit.

4024
04:40:12,960 --> 04:40:14,020
I didn't get all of them.

4025
04:40:14,140 --> 04:40:15,280
I'm pretty sure I got all of them.

4026
04:40:20,930 --> 04:40:22,470
Yeah, I got all of them.

4027
04:40:24,870 --> 04:40:26,310
Yeah, this was on the other side.

4028
04:40:31,490 --> 04:40:31,590
Oh.

4029
04:40:42,310 --> 04:40:45,070
All right, this is where Shaggy got kidnapped.

4030
04:40:46,850 --> 04:40:48,370
Shaggy, I need you down there, Shaggy.

4031
04:40:48,870 --> 04:40:50,950
I got no, no.

4032
04:40:51,750 --> 04:40:53,090
Shaggy and Shaggy, no.

4033
04:40:55,370 --> 04:40:57,290
I don't, Shaggy, no.

4034
04:40:59,090 --> 04:41:00,850
Oh, thank god there is a magic carpet.

4035
04:41:01,070 --> 04:41:01,650
Okay, that's good.

4036
04:41:06,730 --> 04:41:07,670
I got a little worried.

4037
04:41:08,330 --> 04:41:09,870
Because I actually needed him down there.

4038
04:41:12,410 --> 04:41:13,410
Because I have no umbrella.

4039
04:41:19,220 --> 04:41:20,420
Kendra, thank you for the raid.

4040
04:41:20,780 --> 04:41:21,240
Thank you.

4041
04:41:21,240 --> 04:41:21,440
Thank you.

4042
04:41:21,480 --> 04:41:22,480
I've had a good stream.

4043
04:41:26,120 --> 04:41:27,680
I'm trapped in an endless cycle.

4044
04:41:28,580 --> 04:41:29,740
An endless cycle.

4045
04:41:30,360 --> 04:41:31,360
Of Scooby Snacks.

4046
04:41:34,640 --> 04:41:35,600
84.

4047
04:41:40,740 --> 04:41:41,220
Wait.

4048
04:41:44,120 --> 04:41:46,180
Up, going down.

4049
04:41:47,380 --> 04:41:48,440
Going up.

4050
04:41:49,100 --> 04:41:49,960
Going down.

4051
04:41:54,140 --> 04:41:55,920
Going up.

4052
04:41:57,380 --> 04:41:58,880
Oh my god, the worst part.

4053
04:42:00,660 --> 04:42:01,820
What the fuck?

4054
04:42:02,240 --> 04:42:02,560
Okay.

4055
04:42:03,320 --> 04:42:05,100
Why is it in the air?

4056
04:42:06,200 --> 04:42:07,580
Oh my.

4057
04:42:07,660 --> 04:42:08,740
Oh my god, wait.

4058
04:42:09,840 --> 04:42:13,660
The worst part, I can't get out of these Scooby Snacks
because...

4059
04:42:15,660 --> 04:42:19,200
Because I don't have the goddamn umbrella.

4060
04:42:23,620 --> 04:42:24,740
Okay, it's all sandwiches.

4061
04:42:25,700 --> 04:42:28,020
But that means there might be Scooby Snacks.

4062
04:42:28,480 --> 04:42:29,780
There is no Scooby Snacks.

4063
04:42:30,200 --> 04:42:31,460
It's just all sandwiches.

4064
04:42:36,120 --> 04:42:37,240
It's just...

4065
04:42:37,240 --> 04:42:38,380
Oops, all sandwiches!

4066
04:42:40,420 --> 04:42:41,420
Oh, that's cute.

4067
04:42:41,680 --> 04:42:43,880
It says, I said, go away on the carpet.

4068
04:42:47,040 --> 04:42:48,600
That's very unfortunate.

4069
04:42:52,280 --> 04:42:54,720
Maybe there's spooky snacks that I missed down here.

4070
04:42:56,280 --> 04:42:57,560
I didn't miss any here.

4071
04:42:58,160 --> 04:42:58,980
All right, it's fine.

4072
04:42:59,200 --> 04:42:59,640
It's fine.

4073
04:42:59,800 --> 04:43:02,540
Okay, we're missing 137.

4074
04:43:02,720 --> 04:43:05,200
Okay, we got five one where there's, I'm missing a lot.

4075
04:43:06,340 --> 04:43:06,900
Okay, here.

4076
04:43:09,060 --> 04:43:10,280
Oh, okay, here too.

4077
04:43:10,720 --> 04:43:11,060
All right.

4078
04:43:11,640 --> 04:43:13,240
There's a lot of missing here.

4079
04:43:16,100 --> 04:43:16,840
Oh, sandwiches.

4080
04:43:18,360 --> 04:43:18,880
Alright.

4081
04:43:20,080 --> 04:43:20,640
Which way?

4082
04:43:26,010 --> 04:43:27,050
Mr. Ragnarok.

4083
04:43:30,150 --> 04:43:31,130
Okay, here.

4084
04:43:31,690 --> 04:43:33,530
Oh my god, right off the gate.

4085
04:43:37,810 --> 04:43:38,190
Okay.

4086
04:43:38,530 --> 04:43:41,850
There's apparently a lot of Scooby snacks that I'm missing
from here.

4087
04:43:45,880 --> 04:43:47,260
The bookshelves has a hidden...

4088
04:43:47,280 --> 04:43:47,960
didn't snap.

4089
04:43:48,760 --> 04:43:49,200
I'm fine.

4090
04:43:49,860 --> 04:43:50,140
I'm fine.

4091
04:43:50,260 --> 04:43:51,040
I find an opening.

4092
04:43:56,720 --> 04:43:58,280
There's some here too.

4093
04:43:59,280 --> 04:44:00,060
Wait, this way.

4094
04:44:01,880 --> 04:44:02,320
What?

4095
04:44:02,800 --> 04:44:03,820
That's an opening.

4096
04:44:09,280 --> 04:44:10,100
Oh, there it is.

4097
04:44:11,960 --> 04:44:12,620
What?

4098
04:44:13,220 --> 04:44:14,380
Open up!

4099
04:44:15,940 --> 04:44:16,820
There we go.

4100
04:44:18,240 --> 04:44:19,040
Oh, no.

4101
04:44:19,260 --> 04:44:19,880
That has not.

04:44:22,580 --> 04:44:23,900
I already fucking been in here.

4104
04:44:26,800 --> 04:44:28,180
This door is locked from the other side.

4105
04:44:28,440 --> 04:44:28,580
What?

4106
04:44:28,800 --> 04:44:29,060
Where?

4107
04:44:33,530 --> 04:44:34,050
Oh.

4108
04:44:35,150 --> 04:44:36,350
Where was that?

4109
04:44:39,450 --> 04:44:39,970
Okay.

4110
04:44:40,310 --> 04:44:41,590
Nothing missing here.

4111
04:44:44,510 --> 04:44:45,950
Anything missing back here?

4112
04:44:47,710 --> 04:44:48,230
Oh.

4113
04:44:50,690 --> 04:44:52,390
I'm here to collect the Scooby Snacks.

4114
04:44:52,830 --> 04:44:54,350
Scooby Snack Tax Season.

4115
04:44:58,310 --> 04:45:00,290
I feel like I get more if I go backwards.

4116
04:45:01,790 --> 04:45:02,710
I'll go back there.

4117
04:45:02,830 --> 04:45:04,950
That has, like, more...

4118
04:45:04,950 --> 04:45:06,670
More snacks I can obtain.

4119
04:45:10,450 --> 04:45:11,710
Okay, I'm gonna go back.

4120
04:45:16,810 --> 04:45:20,030
I like that the animation is the classic running animation.

4121
04:45:20,770 --> 04:45:21,490
From Scooby.

4122
04:45:22,030 --> 04:45:24,010
I really love the attention of details.

4123
04:45:29,030 --> 04:45:29,750
Bye.

4124
04:45:30,350 --> 04:45:30,910

Okay, here.

04:45:35,430 --> 04:45:37,150
This should be where I got the...

4127
04:45:37,150 --> 04:45:38,490
Where I'm gonna get the snacks.

4128
04:45:40,510 --> 04:45:40,870
Alright.

4129
04:45:41,190 --> 04:45:42,830
How am I gonna grab the snacks?

4130
04:45:44,170 --> 04:45:44,350
Ooh.

Okay, their hitbox is, like, bullshit, guys.

Yay.

4209
04:52:37,950 --> 04:52:40,830
He has a great upper core strength.

4210
04:52:41,090 --> 04:52:41,530
Not gonna lie.

4211
04:52:41,670 --> 04:52:42,910
I will say that.

4212
04:52:44,050 --> 04:52:44,370
Great date.

4213
04:52:44,530 --> 04:52:47,690
Like, because, like, Shag, Scooby is based off of a great
date.

4214
04:52:48,190 --> 04:52:48,530
How?

4215
04:52:50,570 --> 04:52:51,050
How?

4216
04:52:53,270 --> 04:52:54,470
Okay, I'll have to jump.

4217
04:52:54,590 --> 04:52:54,990
Okay, sorry.

4218
04:52:55,090 --> 04:52:56,190
I forgot I had to do work, too.

4219
04:52:57,970 --> 04:53:00,870
I thought he would do most of the work for me.

4220
04:53:01,250 --> 04:53:02,230
That's my bad.

4221
04:53:02,410 --> 04:53:03,450
I didn't realize.

4222
04:53:06,110 --> 04:53:10,250
No, Great Danes are fucking huge and very, very heavy.

4223
04:53:12,650 --> 04:53:17,170
So Shaggy has some big upper core strength to do all of
that.

4224
04:53:24,770 --> 04:53:25,770
Or so to continue.

4225
04:53:28,170 --> 04:53:30,530
Yeah, he's a big, he's a big-ass doggo.

4226
04:53:38,690 --> 04:53:39,490
coffins above.

4227
04:53:40,090 --> 04:53:41,970
Hit the stone switches to find out which one.

4228
04:53:42,450 --> 04:53:42,450
Okay.

4229
04:53:43,230 --> 04:53:44,030
I need those.

4230
04:53:46,710 --> 04:53:48,210
I didn't even hit that.

4231
04:53:49,170 --> 04:53:49,910
What the fuck?

4232
04:53:51,330 --> 04:53:52,910
I didn't even open the coffin.

4233
04:53:55,530 --> 04:53:57,150
Oh, I hope it's not time.

4234
04:53:57,290 --> 04:53:57,490
Is it?

4235
04:53:57,510 --> 04:53:58,310
No, that's a ghost.

4236
04:53:58,910 --> 04:54:00,190
The ghost was in that one.

4237
04:54:03,030 --> 04:54:03,890
What's in this one?

4238
04:54:05,910 --> 04:54:06,710
Oh, yeah!

4239
04:54:06,870 --> 04:54:07,310
I got it!

4240
04:54:07,330 --> 04:54:08,410
I got the Scooby snacks!

4241
04:54:08,690 --> 04:54:10,850
Oh my god, that's a lot of scooby snacks.

4242
04:54:11,290 --> 04:54:12,410
That's free real estate.

4243
04:54:13,230 --> 04:54:15,290
Right there in this market and economy.

4244
04:54:18,590 --> 04:54:19,690
Okay, that's a ghost.

4245
04:54:22,230 --> 04:54:25,230
I know it's all ghosts, but you know, it's just like the
challenge.

4246
04:54:27,770 --> 04:54:29,170
See what I mean, not a ghost, isn't it?

4247
04:54:33,060 --> 04:54:33,460
Damn.

4248
04:54:36,340 --> 04:54:40,420
I'm gonna grab these scooby snacks before I...

4249
04:54:40,440 --> 04:54:41,660
Move, progress.

4250
04:54:44,660 --> 04:54:45,860
That's like Ram 6.

4251
04:54:46,000 --> 04:54:47,660
You can't take them for granted right now.

4252
04:54:49,520 --> 04:54:51,260
I'm not even at 200.

4253
04:54:51,580 --> 04:54:52,700
That's the saddest part.

4254
04:54:54,060 --> 04:54:55,460
In the snack economy.

4255
04:54:56,540 --> 04:55:00,260
I swear, there's like only one dog treat or some shit in the
Scooby-Doo universe.

4256
04:55:00,800 --> 04:55:01,560
I'm not surprised.

4257
04:55:01,640 --> 04:55:03,240
They don't even have fucking umbrellas.

4258
04:55:07,420 --> 04:55:09,000
Alright, down we go.

4259
04:55:11,320 --> 04:55:11,840
Ah.

4260
04:55:18,710 --> 04:55:19,190
Snackonomy.

4261
04:55:20,170 --> 04:55:21,330
Scooby Snacks are like diamonds.

4262
04:55:21,530 --> 04:55:22,910
It's all ran by one company.

4263
04:55:26,270 --> 04:55:27,650
Are you fucking kidding?

4264
04:55:27,830 --> 04:55:28,030
Okay.

4265
04:55:29,230 --> 04:55:31,190
I can't even do anything about the ghost.

4266
04:55:31,750 --> 04:55:32,570
They just exist.

4267
04:55:34,790 --> 04:55:36,130
Can't even kill it.

4268
04:55:36,450 --> 04:55:38,430

4270

Okay, he doesn't care.

4271

4272
04:55:57,080 --> 04:55:57,640

Oh, this has to be the boss.

4277
04:56:07,680 --> 04:56:08,760
Am I getting my umbrella?

4278
04:56:09,820 --> 04:56:11,200
Scooby, help.

4279
04:56:11,780 --> 04:56:12,680
We gotta save her.

4280
04:56:12,840 --> 04:56:13,480
She's hot.

4281
04:56:21,720 --> 04:56:22,120
Strike.

4282
04:56:22,420 --> 04:56:23,120
Keep it up, Scooby.

4283
04:56:23,620 --> 04:56:24,500
I'm almost there.

4284
04:56:25,520 --> 04:56:25,560
Whoa.

4285
04:56:26,180 --> 04:56:28,500
Jeepers, my skin was beginning to chase.

4286
04:56:30,120 --> 04:56:33,020
You won't get away that easily.

4287
04:56:34,380 --> 04:56:35,860
You think that was easy?

4288
04:56:37,800 --> 04:56:38,380
What?

4289
04:56:41,660 --> 04:56:45,840
Here, I think this old friend of yours is dying.

4290
04:56:49,980 --> 04:56:51,700
Oh, God, it's him.

4291
04:56:52,260 --> 04:56:54,080
Scooby, I can't believe it.

4292
04:56:54,320 --> 04:56:56,900
It's the green ghost.

4293
04:56:57,600 --> 04:56:58,880
Not the green ghost.

4294
04:56:59,120 --> 04:56:59,580
That's right.

4295
04:56:59,940 --> 04:57:01,220
And pretty soon you will.

4296
04:57:01,300 --> 04:57:02,460
Daphne too, isn't it?

4297
04:57:04,280 --> 04:57:05,640
It's like that Roger clip.

4298
04:57:05,820 --> 04:57:06,720
It's Roger, isn't it?

4299
04:57:07,400 --> 04:57:09,780
I think it's Daphne's like a friend.

4300
04:57:12,760 --> 04:57:14,480
Yeah, how do I...

4301
04:57:27,630 --> 04:57:28,690
Where are we?

4302
04:57:28,690 --> 04:57:29,990
What am I doing, Daphne?

4303
04:57:30,130 --> 04:57:30,730
Oh, wait, that's it.

4304
04:57:30,790 --> 04:57:31,310
Okay, okay.

Oh, my God.

4311
04:57:52,320 --> 04:57:53,380
I don't want you to go over here.

4312
04:57:56,400 --> 04:57:56,940
That's right.

4313
04:57:59,520 --> 04:58:00,000
What?

4314
04:58:00,100 --> 04:58:01,220
How does that hit me?

4315
04:58:03,100 --> 04:58:04,460

05:08:35,080 --> 05:08:35,300
It's right.

4441
05:08:35,360 --> 05:08:36,420
There's a button to activate that.

4442
05:08:36,580 --> 05:08:38,260
There has to be a button to activate that.

4443
05:08:39,080 --> 05:08:39,320
How?

4444
05:08:39,600 --> 05:08:39,920
How?

4445
05:08:40,180 --> 05:08:40,500
No!

4446
05:08:40,780 --> 05:08:41,560

4447
05:08:41,560 --> 05:08:42,100

Thank you.

4452
05:08:46,840 --> 05:08:47,140
Oh.

4453
05:08:48,340 --> 05:08:48,820
No.

4454
05:08:49,200 --> 05:08:49,680
No.

4455
05:08:50,480 --> 05:08:51,340
Okay, it's okay.

4456
05:08:51,620 --> 05:08:51,800
It's okay.

4457
05:08:51,900 --> 05:08:52,220
It's okay.

4458
05:08:53,740 --> 05:08:54,500
It's okay.

4459
05:08:54,680 --> 05:08:55,480
You can make it

4460
05:08:58,580 --> 05:09:11,360
Life will be fat We can we can survive Wait, what?

4461
05:09:13,360 --> 05:09:17,120
Okay, there you go This level is okay.

4462
05:09:17,420 --> 05:09:19,240
No, I found a worse level

4463
05:09:22,880 --> 05:09:34,600
I think the worst part is just the fact that the buttons
reset if you mess up the parkour Like that's not cool That

4464
05:09:34,600 --> 05:09:35,240
ain't cool

4465
05:09:38,440 --> 05:09:49,080
I would say how come your childhood games always involves
you paying debts to the cookie Mafia Cookies were very

4466
05:09:49,080 --> 05:09:55,040
important back in the day The cookie market was very scary.

4467
05:10:03,160 --> 05:10:04,080
No!

4468
05:10:06,640 --> 05:10:06,640
What?

4469
05:10:14,550 --> 05:10:16,910
It was a different time.

4470
05:10:17,970 --> 05:10:19,550
Kids fucking love cookies.

4471
05:10:22,110 --> 05:10:24,510
It was all about the cookies, bro.

4472
05:10:27,050 --> 05:10:29,690
All kids wanted was more cookies.

4473
05:10:37,200 --> 05:10:41,360
The cookie sends us or the cookie dog sends us regards.

4474
05:10:45,920 --> 05:10:48,400
Yippee Ducky, you get your cookies again.

4475
05:10:50,580 --> 05:10:52,220

Oh my God, I gotta make that jump of my life.

Alright.

4533
05:16:58,320 --> 05:16:59,480

05:16:59,820 --> 05:17:01,940
I, I, oh my god.

4535
05:17:02,480 --> 05:17:02,740

Oh my God.

4537
05:17:11,940 --> 05:17:12,480
Okay.

4538
05:17:13,140 --> 05:17:16,080
Gotta make the leap of faith right here.

4539
05:17:18,740 --> 05:17:20,060
Scooby, you can do it.

4540
05:17:20,900 --> 05:17:21,880
You can do it, Scooby.

4541
05:17:25,200 --> 05:17:26,000
Holy shit.

4542
05:17:26,420 --> 05:17:27,180
That was so scary.

4543
05:17:29,180 --> 05:17:30,300
That was so scary.

4544
05:17:31,740 --> 05:17:32,040
There we go.

4545
05:17:32,140 --> 05:17:33,100
We got another warp.

4546
05:17:34,680 --> 05:17:36,580
Oh, I had to lock in there.

4547
05:17:37,540 --> 05:17:39,180
The scariest jump there.

4548
05:17:40,000 --> 05:17:41,660
The leap to end our leaps.

4549
05:17:42,840 --> 05:17:42,900
Oh.

4550
05:17:45,780 --> 05:17:48,280
Okay, I was going to say, wait, I was Oh, hey, nice.

4551
05:17:48,320 --> 05:17:49,020
Oh, I don't want to see...

4552
05:17:49,020 --> 05:17:50,020
Okay, we're going to keep that.

4553
05:17:51,720 --> 05:17:52,660
We're going to keep...

4554
05:17:55,600 --> 05:17:56,980
I didn't realize.

4555
05:17:57,380 --> 05:17:58,420
We had to keep that.

4556
05:17:59,520 --> 05:18:01,080
That one was important.

4557
05:18:04,060 --> 05:18:04,300
How?

4558
05:18:05,540 --> 05:18:08,560
Where are my sticky, fucking suction boots?

4559
05:18:16,180 --> 05:18:17,660
Oh, my God.

4560
05:18:20,640 --> 05:18:22,120
This is so rough.

4561
05:18:22,420 --> 05:18:23,940
It is actually so rough.

4562
05:18:25,880 --> 05:18:27,100
At least we killed a lady.

4563
05:18:28,360 --> 05:18:29,300
It's okay, it was a witch.

4564
05:18:32,260 --> 05:18:33,360
Down we go.

4565
05:18:36,280 --> 05:18:37,100
It's okay, guys.

4566
05:18:37,260 --> 05:18:40,080
What we learned from the witch trials, witches don't have
rights.

4567
05:18:41,240 --> 05:18:41,940
So it's okay.

4568
05:18:42,420 --> 05:18:43,800
What we did was okay.

4569
05:18:47,460 --> 05:18:49,220
The technically children of Satan.

4570
05:18:51,540 --> 05:18:52,020
Okay.

4571
05:18:52,420 --> 05:18:53,380
But true.

4572
05:18:53,720 --> 05:18:55,760
And they have no souls, too.

4573
05:19:00,100 --> 05:19:00,700
Shit.

4574
05:19:05,590 --> 05:19:08,310
What I did was okay for humanity.

4575
05:19:15,240 --> 05:19:16,580
All right, it's okay.

4576
05:19:20,800 --> 05:19:22,160
Damn toky.

4577
05:19:23,860 --> 05:19:27,120
It's their fault for selling their souls to the devil.

4578
05:19:28,280 --> 05:19:28,960
Okay.

4579
05:19:29,280 --> 05:19:31,200
So I could do all this.

4580
05:19:37,200 --> 05:19:38,660
I read my witch lore.

4581
05:19:43,040 --> 05:19:44,160
And witches, they don't know.

4582
05:19:44,240 --> 05:19:45,420
They don't float, right?

4583
05:19:46,380 --> 05:19:48,060
That's like one of the witch trials.

4584
05:19:48,340 --> 05:19:48,980
You throw them.

4585
05:19:50,000 --> 05:19:51,320
You throw them in the ocean.

4586
05:19:51,460 --> 05:19:53,880
And if they start floating, they're a witch.

4587
05:19:56,700 --> 05:19:58,700
Like you start, you tie rocks on them.

4588
05:19:58,920 --> 05:19:59,520
If they float.

4589
05:20:00,280 --> 05:20:00,580
Witch.

4590
05:20:03,480 --> 05:20:04,280
It's true!

4591
05:20:05,320 --> 05:20:06,780
I know my witch lore.

4592
05:20:12,660 --> 05:20:14,720
Yeah, if you can swim, you're a witch.

4593
05:20:17,080 --> 05:20:22,160
Yeah, so like they, okay, so like, they were, if they
drowned, then I guess they were just wrong.

4594
05:20:22,360 --> 05:20:26,600
You know, if they drowned, then I guess, oops, sorry, we're
just, oops, sorry, wrong guy.

4595
05:20:28,260 --> 05:20:29,500
But they don't drown.

4596
05:20:29,660 --> 05:20:31,160
Look, it's the risk they're willing to take.

4597
05:20:45,460 --> 05:20:46,180
I hear you.

4598
05:20:48,220 --> 05:20:48,620
Okay.

4599
05:20:52,210 --> 05:20:56,490
all right up we go oh my god look at all these scooby snacks

4600
05:20:59,530 --> 05:21:00,490
oh chicken

4601
05:21:07,840 --> 05:21:15,660
apparently if you're too pretty you're also a witch i was
reading i was watching these youtube shorts where this lady

4602
05:21:15,660 --> 05:21:22,840
was talking about like what what could you get burned for
being a witch and one of them was like if you're too Pretty,

4603
05:21:23,100 --> 05:21:23,740
you're a witch.

4604
05:21:24,900 --> 05:21:27,720
Like, only beautiful women are witches.

4605
05:21:33,320 --> 05:21:34,360
Thank God.

4606
05:21:34,880 --> 05:21:35,880
I'm not.

4607
05:21:39,820 --> 05:21:41,460
Curse entranches, yeah.

4608
05:21:47,590 --> 05:21:48,810
Also, a bear's like, what was it?

4609
05:21:48,830 --> 05:21:51,790
If you know how to read, they'll call you a witch, too.

4610
05:21:53,790 --> 05:21:55,510
I think that one was wild.

4611
05:22:04,580 --> 05:22:06,860
Oh, a rooster token.

4612
05:22:07,140 --> 05:22:08,820
What did this open, anyway?

4613
05:22:13,190 --> 05:22:14,890
Yeah, good thing I can't read, guys.

4614
05:22:15,050 --> 05:22:16,450
Can't possibly be a witch.

4615
05:22:19,270 --> 05:22:21,130
I don't know how to grab that scooby snap.

4616
05:22:25,050 --> 05:22:27,050
Yeah, can't read.

4617
05:22:27,470 --> 05:22:28,370
Can't be a witch.

4618
05:22:29,910 --> 05:22:31,090
Oh, I opened this door.

4619
05:22:31,310 --> 05:22:31,570
Nice.

4620
05:22:39,590 --> 05:22:40,470
Okay, nice.

4621
05:22:41,210 --> 05:22:41,570
Oh, I'll

4622
05:22:46,970 --> 05:22:50,970
do this.

4623
05:22:54,790 --> 05:22:55,310
Are you?

4624
05:22:55,530 --> 05:22:56,010
Oh, my God.

4625
05:22:56,370 --> 05:22:57,170
Oh, okay, it's fine.

4626
05:22:59,110 --> 05:23:00,490
All right, we slam dunk the fish.

4627
05:23:04,590 --> 05:23:05,230
Oh, my God.

4628
05:23:05,570 --> 05:23:07,150
No, please don't tell me I have to reopen that door.

4629
05:23:08,050 --> 05:23:08,690
Oh, my God.

4630
05:23:08,870 --> 05:23:11,490
It's all the way back there, too.

4631
05:23:12,050 --> 05:23:13,070
Oh, I don't have to open the door.

4632
05:23:13,150 --> 05:23:13,630
I don't have to open.

4633
05:23:13,690 --> 05:23:14,270
I don't think so.

4634
05:23:17,390 --> 05:23:19,870
Oh, I have to.

4635
05:23:23,650 --> 05:23:24,310
God damn it.

4636
05:23:26,950 --> 05:23:27,890
That's fine.

4637
05:23:29,690 --> 05:23:32,950
But I think I slam dunked the switch and then I used it as a
platform.

4638
05:23:35,290 --> 05:23:36,910
Oh, it was close.

4639
05:23:37,370 --> 05:23:38,230
I was close, though.

4640
05:23:42,580 --> 05:23:45,320
No, that platform is definitely scarier than the monsters.

4641
05:23:45,500 --> 05:23:47,360
There is an invisible wall right there.

4642
05:23:47,380 --> 05:23:47,700
There?

4643
05:23:47,900 --> 05:23:48,660
What the fuck?

4644
05:23:48,840 --> 05:23:49,660
Who built that?

4645
05:24:11,140 --> 05:24:12,000
It's okay.

4646
05:24:12,760 --> 05:24:13,340
It's okay.

4647
05:24:14,740 --> 05:24:14,940
Chicano.

Thank you.

4651
05:24:18,220 --> 05:24:20,840
This is a big surprise for Doki.

4652
05:24:21,100 --> 05:24:23,560
Have you heard her top mutant talk?

4653
05:24:23,620 --> 05:24:28,420
She'd have a fielded nice guy where she's while she's still
was still immune to the super chat.

4654
05:24:28,600 --> 05:24:28,760
Thank you.

4655
05:24:29,080 --> 05:24:29,440
Thank you.

4656
05:24:29,880 --> 05:24:40,340
If witches are bad, then why do the next girls make me feel
funny if evil why high that's how they tempt you that's why

4657
05:24:40,340 --> 05:24:49,500
they burn the hot ones that's why one of the witches like
the uh the hints of someone was a witch wasn't they're too

4658
05:24:49,500 --> 05:25:04,360

4660
05:25:22,340 --> 05:25:28,600
Bro it spins and it goes up and That's actually bullshit.

4661
05:25:29,500 --> 05:25:32,300
They spin and go up and down.

4662
05:25:32,980 --> 05:25:34,580
Like, it's the double whammy.

4663
05:25:35,140 --> 05:25:38,540
Oh my god, I accidentally fucking almost dived across.

4664
05:25:44,460 --> 05:25:46,060
Here we go again.

4665
05:25:50,120 --> 05:25:51,540
A wombo combo.

4666
05:25:53,600 --> 05:25:54,700
So let's try this again.

4667
05:25:54,860 --> 05:25:55,540
And just switch.

4668
05:25:58,780 --> 05:26:00,720
God damn, it was so...

4669
05:26:00,720 --> 05:26:01,860
It was always so close.

4670
05:26:12,330 --> 05:26:12,770
Okay.

4671
05:26:14,730 --> 05:26:16,530
I don't think I can no-hit this game.

4672
05:26:16,630 --> 05:26:18,370
I have to get these fuckers out of here.

4673
05:26:21,510 --> 05:26:22,250
I gotta wait.

4674
05:26:27,520 --> 05:26:29,520
Jesus Christ, it's so fast, too.

4675
05:26:29,520 --> 05:26:30,440
I think that's the worst part.

4676
05:26:31,740 --> 05:26:33,320
I sat in the middle of this.

4677
05:26:35,540 --> 05:26:36,940
Yeah, I know, that's bullshit.

4678
05:26:39,740 --> 05:26:41,980
Like, what the fuck?

4679
05:26:44,980 --> 05:26:46,420
Oh my god.

4680
05:26:49,620 --> 05:26:50,720
That's actually bullshit.

4681
05:26:53,320 --> 05:26:53,680
No!

4682
05:26:58,690 --> 05:27:04,680
I didn't realize you can tilt all the way.

4683
05:27:09,220 --> 05:27:11,300
Oh my god.

4684
05:27:26,310 --> 05:27:32,910

It didn't mean what it said.

4752

It did say, it did say it would be hard to get back, it did
warn you.

4790
05:38:04,800 --> 05:38:08,130
A platform.

4791
05:38:08,230 --> 05:38:09,950
are calling to you.

4792
05:38:10,230 --> 05:38:11,670
Wait, wait, hold!

4793
05:38:17,120 --> 05:38:19,340
Wait, there is one place.

4794
05:38:22,820 --> 05:38:23,300
Keep holding?

4795
05:38:33,070 --> 05:38:34,010
Here, here, here.

4796
05:38:37,710 --> 05:38:39,290
Alright, okay, okay, it's six.

4797
05:38:39,370 --> 05:38:40,630
I found a place.

4798
05:38:41,370 --> 05:38:43,810
This is the last, this has to be the last one.

4799
05:38:45,030 --> 05:38:45,890
Wait, I can go here.

4800
05:38:46,030 --> 05:38:46,910
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

4801
05:38:48,130 --> 05:38:48,910
It's here, here.

4802
05:38:49,010 --> 05:38:49,090
Here.

4803
05:38:50,870 --> 05:38:52,690
The original hedge maze.

4804
05:38:54,290 --> 05:38:55,350
It's right here.

4805
05:38:59,630 --> 05:39:01,350
There's a lot of snacks in the original.

4806
05:39:06,330 --> 05:39:06,610
Okay.

4807
05:39:07,710 --> 05:39:09,010
I left a lot.

4808
05:39:10,930 --> 05:39:13,510
Guys, I know it looks very empty, but I left a lot.

4809
05:39:14,010 --> 05:39:15,370
I'll get there eventually.

4810
05:39:17,850 --> 05:39:19,250
You tell when I stop caring.

4811
05:39:19,550 --> 05:39:20,350
You can tell.

4812
05:39:20,910 --> 05:39:22,090
Get more ingredients from Germany.

4813
05:39:22,150 --> 05:39:23,870
They give a super chat bot.

4814
05:39:23,970 --> 05:39:24,570
They can thank you.

4815
05:39:24,750 --> 05:39:25,870
Good morning to you too.

4816
05:39:28,110 --> 05:39:28,410
Okay.

4818
05:39:34,570 --> 05:39:34,950
Okay.

4819
05:39:37,930 --> 05:39:39,570
Where does this start adding up?

4820
05:39:41,350 --> 05:39:42,870
Where did all the snacks go?

4821
05:39:43,570 --> 05:39:44,290
Don't wait.

4822
05:39:44,450 --> 05:39:45,370
I ate everything.

4823
05:39:50,380 --> 05:39:50,940

4824
05:39:50,960 --> 05:39:51,280

4832
05:40:56,060 --> 05:40:57,200
That's the last one.

4833

I told you I left some snacks by emergency rations.

There's no way.

4842
05:41:22,530 --> 05:41:25,410
There's not enough Scooby snacks for it to hit an 800.

4843
05:41:25,870 --> 05:41:34,530
There's not enough there's it there's no way they made the
jump from 600 to 750 when they were doing increments of 50

4844
05:41:34,530 --> 05:41:43,650
like and it's something like hello surprise 150 now the

4861
05:43:25,300 --> 05:43:27,360
All right, grab the momentum, Scooby.

4862
05:43:30,100 --> 05:43:30,980

It's unlocked, though.

4927
05:49:59,800 --> 05:50:00,560
I did it.

4928
05:50:00,900 --> 05:50:02,120
I'm in the pirate ship.

4929
05:50:02,700 --> 05:50:04,040
Shiver your timber, Scooby.

4930
05:50:05,520 --> 05:50:06,620
I just need soap, right?

4931
05:50:06,720 --> 05:50:08,180
Soap is the last power up.

4932
05:50:08,480 --> 05:50:08,820
Friend!

4933
05:50:09,100 --> 05:50:10,540
See if you can get me down, Scoob.

4934
05:50:13,720 --> 05:50:14,560
I know, Fwen.

4935
05:50:15,320 --> 05:50:16,060
Thanks, Scooby.

4936
05:50:17,060 --> 05:50:19,100
Thank the masterminds behind this mystery.

4937
05:50:19,520 --> 05:50:20,120
Oh, yeah, no.

4938
05:50:20,460 --> 05:50:21,980
Yeah, you think I'm...

4939
05:50:22,000 --> 05:50:22,820
Mastermind?

4940
05:50:23,920 --> 05:50:24,900
Ooh, that's not.

4941
05:50:25,180 --> 05:50:28,540
If we look around, we can find some clues that will lead us
right to him.

4942
05:50:29,040 --> 05:50:30,000
And to the professor.

4943
05:50:30,740 --> 05:50:30,860
Oh.

4944
05:50:31,820 --> 05:50:33,120
Like behind you.

4945
05:50:33,280 --> 05:50:34,260
Fred, no!

4946
05:50:38,500 --> 05:50:40,940
I've had a belly full of your meddling.

4947
05:50:41,960 --> 05:50:43,240
It's high past time.

4948
05:50:43,360 --> 05:50:45,520
I did away with you once and for all.

4949
05:50:45,780 --> 05:50:48,200
Oh my God, those pesky meddling kids.

4950
05:50:48,520 --> 05:50:50,420
I think you remember this old adversary of yours.

4951
05:50:50,840 --> 05:50:53,320
He certainly remembers the years.

4952
05:50:53,460 --> 05:50:55,320
Red beard!

4953
05:51:01,810 --> 05:51:04,390
It's the roast of red beard!

4954
05:51:04,830 --> 05:51:06,610
Not the roast of red beard!

4955
05:51:09,590 --> 05:51:10,610
He's real!

4956
05:51:12,010 --> 05:51:15,610
I think your old foe has a score to settle with you.

4957
05:51:18,850 --> 05:51:20,430
Fred, get out of that barrel!

4958
05:51:20,590 --> 05:51:21,190
Tip over!

4959
05:51:21,710 --> 05:51:23,190
Oh wait, no, he'll get me stuck even more.

4960
05:51:25,650 --> 05:51:40,210
Oh no Rolro Oh my god, he's invulnerable to do this Oh my
god, and there's ghosted fucking rain ghost chasing after me

4961
05:51:40,210 --> 05:51:54,450
You No I don't know I don't know I

4962
05:51:59,430 --> 05:52:01,930
The ghosts, they don't know how to...

4963
05:52:05,290 --> 05:52:07,530
The ghosts, they can't get stunned!

4964
05:52:07,910 --> 05:52:09,830
Oh my god, wait, I can kill those ghosts?

4965
05:52:11,130 --> 05:52:12,090
Wait, what?

4966
05:52:13,870 --> 05:52:14,390
Okay.

4967
05:52:15,370 --> 05:52:17,530
I didn't know those ghosts...

4968
05:52:17,530 --> 05:52:19,750
It's because he's wearing a raincoat, guys.

4969
05:52:20,010 --> 05:52:20,910
I get it.

4970
05:52:21,310 --> 05:52:22,630
It's because he has a raincoat.

4971
05:52:22,770 --> 05:52:25,370
Oh my god, okay, okay, okay, okay.

4972
05:52:27,650 --> 05:52:28,270
Okay.

4973
05:52:32,900 --> 05:52:36,800
Apparently, if you have raincoats on, you're vulnerable.

4974
05:52:37,340 --> 05:52:39,000
That's what you get for wearing clothes.

4975
05:52:39,500 --> 05:52:40,500
He has clothes on.

4976
05:52:41,460 --> 05:52:42,720
They reverse everything.

4977
05:52:44,680 --> 05:52:46,980
They're not real ghosts if they start wearing clothes.

4978
05:52:47,560 --> 05:52:48,850
Guys, dude, that's the rule.

4979
05:52:54,500 --> 05:52:56,660
Yeah, clothing is a debuff.

4980
05:52:58,240 --> 05:52:59,660
Oh god, there's three of them now.

4981
05:53:00,180 --> 05:53:00,560
Oh.

4982
05:53:02,280 --> 05:53:03,340
Oh my god, okay.

4983
05:53:04,000 --> 05:53:04,700
Okay, okay.

4984
05:53:05,120 --> 05:53:06,520
Guys, guys.

4985
05:53:07,520 --> 05:53:08,080
There we go.

4986
05:53:08,640 --> 05:53:09,600
I was like, chill, guys.

4987
05:53:14,300 --> 05:53:15,060
I'm right here.

4988
05:53:15,980 --> 05:53:17,620
Oh my god, I have to kill him.

4989
05:53:17,680 --> 05:53:19,740
Oh, I have to kill him right when I'm right there.

4990
05:53:20,180 --> 05:53:20,940
God damn it.

4991
05:53:22,280 --> 05:53:23,200
That's messed up.

4992
05:53:31,160 --> 05:53:31,540
Okay.

4993
05:53:31,880 --> 05:53:33,220
I have to kill them when I'm here.

4994
05:53:35,220 --> 05:53:50,800

He ran away.

5004
05:55:05,540 --> 05:55:08,000
No, he's not dead, guys.

5005
05:55:08,140 --> 05:55:09,000
We didn't see it.

5006
05:55:09,300 --> 05:55:12,460
We didn't see it happen, so he might be alive.

5007
05:55:14,420 --> 05:55:15,260
Bro, he did.

5008
05:55:18,220 --> 05:55:19,420
Years ago.

5009
05:55:19,520 --> 05:55:20,760
How old were you guys?

5010
05:55:21,020 --> 05:55:21,580
Hey, guys.

5011
05:55:22,540 --> 05:55:23,760
Watch out, guys.

5012
05:55:24,100 --> 05:55:25,580
The creeper's chasing me.

5013
05:55:26,340 --> 05:55:27,600
Velma, wait a second.

5014
05:55:28,940 --> 05:55:30,680
There's something on your glasses.

5015
05:55:32,660 --> 05:55:34,780
The creeper times two.

5016
05:55:35,280 --> 05:55:36,560
Now this is a clue.

5017
05:55:37,760 --> 05:55:39,280
And clues like this just don't follow your map.

5018
05:55:39,280 --> 05:55:40,140
10 years ago.

5019
05:55:40,420 --> 05:55:42,800
Were you 10 when you caught the creeper?

5020
05:55:47,090 --> 05:55:48,450
Oh, Shaggy!

5021
05:55:50,830 --> 05:55:51,510
Raggy!

5022
05:55:52,270 --> 05:55:52,950
Scoob!

5023
05:55:54,950 --> 05:55:55,510
Food!

5024
05:55:58,050 --> 05:55:58,730
Yay!

5025
05:55:59,750 --> 05:56:03,210
We should go find Daphne and Holly and put all our clues
together.

5026
05:56:03,810 --> 05:56:05,910
And find that mastermind.

5027
05:56:06,910 --> 05:56:08,150
Try the secret lab.

5028
05:56:09,370 --> 05:56:10,890
I have to thank you for the super chat.

5029
05:56:11,170 --> 05:56:11,690
Thank you.

5030
05:56:11,690 --> 05:56:12,110
Thank you.

5031
05:56:13,010 --> 05:56:13,410
Oh.

5032
05:56:14,250 --> 05:56:16,390
Before she disappeared with Rathney.

5033
05:56:17,530 --> 05:56:18,250
Come on, you two.

5034
05:56:18,530 --> 05:56:19,530
You're coming with us.

5035
05:56:20,190 --> 05:56:21,750
We're going to be a gang again.

5036
05:56:21,930 --> 05:56:23,130
We're not splitting up.

5037
05:56:23,310 --> 05:56:25,290
Fred wants us to stop our smorgasbord.

5038
05:56:26,210 --> 05:56:26,770
Oh.

5039
05:56:27,570 --> 05:56:28,490
Okay, guys.

5040
05:56:28,670 --> 05:56:31,810
If you want to stay in this creepy cove all alone.

5041
05:56:32,210 --> 05:56:32,610
Oh.

5042
05:56:32,790 --> 05:56:33,290
Oh.

5043
05:56:33,310 --> 05:56:35,150
Ready and I got rid of the roasts.

5044
05:56:36,450 --> 05:56:38,390
So lots of goodies and no ghosts.

5045
05:56:38,890 --> 05:56:41,230
Sounds better than a secret lab, huh Scoob?

5046
05:56:42,250 --> 05:56:42,670
Yeah.

5047
05:56:43,250 --> 05:56:45,090
A roast free room.

5048
05:56:45,550 --> 05:56:45,790
Yay.

5049
05:56:46,610 --> 05:56:47,870
All right then.

5050
05:56:48,210 --> 05:56:49,350
We'll catch up with you later.

5051
05:56:49,350 --> 05:56:50,590
Wait, no, let's not split up.

5052
05:56:50,890 --> 05:56:51,910
No, no, no, no, no, wait.

5053
05:56:52,510 --> 05:56:55,250
Wait, wait, why don't we just wait and eat together, guys?

5054
05:56:57,270 --> 05:56:59,090
We don't have to split up, gang.

5055
05:56:59,450 --> 05:57:00,110
What's this?

5056
05:57:00,430 --> 05:57:02,830
Professor Graham's tricky, sticky gum do hickie.

5057
05:57:03,310 --> 05:57:04,290
What do you say, Scoob?

5058
05:57:04,630 --> 05:57:05,410
Want to give it a try?

5059
05:57:06,590 --> 05:57:07,010
Okay.

5060
05:57:07,590 --> 05:57:08,130
Oh, wait.

5061
05:57:08,190 --> 05:57:08,910
Is that the soap?

5062
05:57:09,550 --> 05:57:14,350
It says here, this stuff will stick creeps in place so you
can bounce off their heads.

5063
05:57:14,970 --> 05:57:15,210
Ah.

5064
05:57:16,390 --> 05:57:17,790
Oh, the Rose Diver.

5065
05:57:18,730 --> 05:57:20,350
Yeah, like the Ghost Diver.

5066
05:57:21,210 --> 05:57:23,490
Oh, the Rose Diver.

5067
05:57:26,970 --> 05:57:29,390
He invented the gum bar machine.

5068
05:57:34,070 --> 05:57:36,210
Would you want to present this game, Tilky?

5069
05:57:36,450 --> 05:57:38,290
Not even for a Scooby-Stack, girl.

5070
05:57:38,530 --> 05:57:39,550
How about for six...

5071
05:57:39,550 --> 05:57:41,730
Oh, my God, you host, Gabby.

5072
05:57:42,090 --> 05:57:44,010
Thank you for the super chat.

5073
05:57:44,290 --> 05:57:44,570
Thank you.

5074
05:57:44,890 --> 05:57:45,330
Thank you.

5075
05:57:46,050 --> 05:57:46,870
We're almost there.

5076
05:57:48,630 --> 05:57:51,910
The Roast Rider is the ghost that I have it.

5077
05:57:55,630 --> 05:57:56,370
Hey, where am I?

5078
05:57:57,050 --> 05:57:57,370
Oh.

5079
05:57:58,830 --> 05:58:00,390
Shout to the Mystery Manor.

5080
05:58:00,570 --> 05:58:01,430
Take me out of here.

5081
05:58:02,190 --> 05:58:02,950
Take me out.

5082
05:58:04,150 --> 05:58:05,070
Get me out.

5083
05:58:05,350 --> 05:58:06,810
Shoot me back to the home.

5084
05:58:08,830 --> 05:58:09,350
See, guys?

5085
05:58:09,570 --> 05:58:10,670
Look, he didn't break his arm.

5086
05:58:11,550 --> 05:58:13,510
And then a supernatural team came over.

5087
05:58:13,650 --> 05:58:15,210
And then physics was invented.

5088
05:58:16,350 --> 05:58:17,150
Stupid supernatural.

5089
05:58:22,180 --> 05:58:22,620
Wait.

5090
05:58:24,000 --> 05:58:25,220
How do I use the...

5091
05:58:25,220 --> 05:58:27,200
It didn't even teach me how to use the attack.

5092
05:58:27,900 --> 05:58:28,320
Oh!

5093
05:58:32,670 --> 05:58:33,970
How do I use it?

5094
05:58:34,250 --> 05:58:35,450
Oh, it's left...

5095
05:58:35,450 --> 05:58:36,630
Okay, it's...

5096
05:58:36,630 --> 05:58:37,390
It's left bumper.

5097
05:58:37,510 --> 05:58:38,550
Okay, I figured it out.

5098
05:58:38,830 --> 05:58:39,510
Alright, where do we have...

5099
05:58:39,530 --> 05:58:39,910
to go.

5100
05:58:40,070 --> 05:58:40,630
I'm confused.

5101
05:58:40,730 --> 05:58:42,250
Oh, do I go to a secret lab now?

5102
05:58:43,370 --> 05:58:44,870
Okay, secret lab time.

5103
05:58:46,270 --> 05:58:47,650
The super secret lab.

5104
05:58:52,170 --> 05:58:52,730
Alright.

5105
05:58:57,400 --> 05:58:58,400
lab time.

5106
05:58:59,700 --> 05:59:00,680
Oh, what the fuck?

5107
05:59:10,100 --> 05:59:11,400
What the fuck?

5108
05:59:12,100 --> 05:59:13,040
It's this guy.

5109
05:59:15,420 --> 05:59:16,380
I made it.

5110
05:59:17,520 --> 05:59:19,060
I don't think I was supposed to.

5111
05:59:19,080 --> 05:59:29,240
to be here i don't i don't think oh my god what the out my
how

5112
05:59:38,480 --> 05:59:41,120

5113
05:59:49,110 --> 05:59:51,390
bro it's in the lava

5114
05:59:58,610 --> 06:00:01,410
yeah those keys are gone

5115
06:00:04,490 --> 06:00:05,470
Come on, the ghost?

5116
06:00:06,810 --> 06:00:08,490
Oh my god, what the...

5117
06:00:15,860 --> 06:00:17,760
What do I do, though, a bit?

5118
06:00:21,510 --> 06:00:23,110
Oh my, I'm so fucking dumb.

5119
06:00:24,670 --> 06:00:25,690
That's so goofy.

5120
06:00:32,900 --> 06:00:34,520
Like, oh my god, what the fuck?

5121
06:00:34,600 --> 06:00:36,220
It's not even, like, forever.

5122
06:00:42,150 --> 06:00:43,590
I'm so confused.

5123
06:00:45,630 --> 06:00:47,310
Okay, this mechanic sucks.

5124
06:00:52,360 --> 06:00:53,660
Okay, there we go.

5125
06:01:03,020 --> 06:01:03,620
I...

5126
06:01:03,620 --> 06:01:06,220
Where am I supposed to go?

5127
06:01:09,220 --> 06:01:14,020
Yeah, I did this thing, but then, like, the keys are in
lava.

5128
06:01:15,440 --> 06:01:17,520
Like, what the fuck am I supposed to do?

5129
06:01:18,160 --> 06:01:19,620
They put it in lava!

5130
06:01:37,500 --> 06:01:38,900
What the fuck?

5131
06:01:39,960 --> 06:01:41,660
I'm so confused.

5132
06:01:45,690 --> 06:01:48,190
Oh, I have to grab the cages to get them out.

5133
06:01:48,250 --> 06:01:48,950
Oh, okay.

5134
06:01:49,110 --> 06:01:50,310
Okay, I get it.

5135
06:01:52,890 --> 06:01:54,330
I don't have to grab the cages.

5136
06:01:59,750 --> 06:02:01,470
Oh, I can't grab it.

5137
06:02:05,460 --> 06:02:05,920
Okay.

5138
06:02:06,780 --> 06:02:07,160
All right.

5139
06:02:08,040 --> 06:02:11,500
I sort of get it, but it's also very confusing.

5140
06:02:12,360 --> 06:02:12,900
Oh, my God.

5141
06:02:13,000 --> 06:02:13,600

It's not fair.

5175
06:04:45,590 --> 06:04:46,690
It's not a bug.

5176
06:04:46,930 --> 06:04:47,650
It's a feature.

5177
06:04:48,390 --> 06:04:49,210
It's unfair.

5178
06:04:50,170 --> 06:04:51,650

5191
06:06:09,100 --> 06:06:09,560
All right.

06:06:11,000 --> 06:06:12,040
Got another button in.

5193
06:06:13,380 --> 06:06:15,740
I don't know what that opens, but...

5194
06:06:16,440 --> 06:06:17,320
No, I swear to God.

5195
06:06:17,580 --> 06:06:18,080
This is just...

5196
06:06:18,080 --> 06:06:18,820
Okay, okay, it's gonna stay.

5197
06:06:18,880 --> 06:06:20,100
I swear to God, that was just...

5198
06:06:20,100 --> 06:06:21,100
That felt like bait.

5199
06:06:24,940 --> 06:06:25,680
Open sesame?

5200
06:06:27,760 --> 06:06:30,240

5201
06:06:30,240 --> 06:06:31,280
It's here, isn't it?

5202
06:06:31,780 --> 06:06:32,720
I fucking knew it.

5203
06:06:32,800 --> 06:06:35,140
I knew that was a fake-ass wall.

5204
06:06:41,260 --> 06:06:42,760
All right, here we go.

5205
06:06:48,780 --> 06:06:52,340
All right, these guys seem rough.

5206
06:06:56,380 --> 06:06:58,260
I knew there were fucking Scooby Snacks in there.

5207
06:06:58,340 --> 06:06:59,160
You can't hide from me.

5208
06:06:59,220 --> 06:07:00,860
I got my Scooby Snacks sense in.

5209
06:07:03,220 --> 06:07:03,760

06:07:03,760 --> 06:07:04,220
Okay, it's okay.

5211
06:07:04,360 --> 06:07:04,560
It's okay.

5212
06:07:04,860 --> 06:07:07,840
I purposely died so I can get my HP back.

5213
06:07:11,340 --> 06:07:13,380
I had very little HP.

5214
06:07:15,700 --> 06:07:16,960
Oh my god, he has it.

5215
06:07:20,280 --> 06:07:21,280
It's okay, we'll just wait.

5216
06:07:21,460 --> 06:07:22,100
I can wait.

5217
06:07:23,500 --> 06:07:24,360
Okay, never mind.

5218
06:07:26,300 --> 06:07:26,700
Stop.

5219
06:07:32,210 --> 06:07:32,850
Okay, nice.

5220
06:07:33,030 --> 06:07:34,390
Okay, I don't know if that was...

5221
06:07:34,390 --> 06:07:35,350
That was supposed to...

5222
06:07:35,350 --> 06:07:36,170
Are you serious?

5223
06:07:37,050 --> 06:07:37,570
Okay, it's fine.

06:07:37,630 --> 06:07:38,490

5225
06:07:38,650 --> 06:07:40,290
It's not food, but I got bubblegum.

5226
06:07:43,430 --> 06:07:44,550
Open the door.

5227
06:07:47,990 --> 06:07:49,350
That's me one of the keys, right?

5228
06:07:54,690 --> 06:07:56,610
That's a fake-ass wall!

5229
06:08:02,800 --> 06:08:04,880
There's no way that's a real wall.

5230
06:08:28,220 --> 06:08:29,680
What do you mean I can't get back up?

5231
06:08:30,220 --> 06:08:31,160
What do you...

5232
06:08:31,160 --> 06:08:31,460
Okay.

5233
06:08:42,400 --> 06:08:44,120
What the fuck?

5234
06:08:44,340 --> 06:08:45,940
Why?

5235
06:08:48,780 --> 06:08:51,760
Oh my god, what's the point?

5236
06:08:51,860 --> 06:08:54,080
What's the point of fixed?

5237
06:08:54,720 --> 06:08:57,560
A fucking fixed camera angle.

5238
06:08:58,440 --> 06:09:01,560
Actually, oh my god.

5239
06:09:02,320 --> 06:09:04,960
The goddamn fixed camera angles.

5240
06:09:05,160 --> 06:09:06,860
Oh my god, it's here.

5241
06:09:10,460 --> 06:09:11,520
Oh, beware.

5242
06:09:12,820 --> 06:09:13,560
Beware.

5243
06:09:19,180 --> 06:09:23,640
I know I'm already here, but I'm like Why did it backtrack
me here?

5244
06:09:33,790 --> 06:09:35,830
Where am I supposed to fucking go?

5245
06:09:44,140 --> 06:09:46,060
I am so confused.

5246
06:09:47,640 --> 06:09:47,800
Okay.

06:09:49,720 --> 06:09:50,820
We're here now.

06:09:52,300 --> 06:09:53,480
Where the fuck do I go?

5249
06:09:55,740 --> 06:09:57,080
It's a circle, yes.

5250
06:09:57,880 --> 06:09:59,060
But I'm confused.

5251
06:10:07,730 --> 06:10:08,990

Oh my god, I don't know.

5255

I was like, why is there a fucking random hole here?

5256
06:10:31,470 --> 06:10:33,030
Maybe there's something I'm missing.

5257
06:10:38,380 --> 06:10:38,820
Woo!

5258
06:10:42,060 --> 06:10:43,860

06:27:02,980 --> 06:27:04,220

Of course the ghost haunts the goddamn laundry room.

5437
06:27:37,720 --> 06:27:38,980
What else would ghosts do?

5438
06:27:39,860 --> 06:27:40,500
Oh, yay!

5439
06:27:44,980 --> 06:27:48,420

Yeah, me too.

5457
06:29:10,500 --> 06:29:12,380
I looked up how long is this game?

5458
06:29:13,040 --> 06:29:17,480
And I legitimately thought it was not...

5459
06:29:17,480 --> 06:29:19,760
They said it would be four hours.

5460
06:29:21,800 --> 06:29:22,940
How do I...

5461
06:29:22,940 --> 06:29:23,280

06:29:58,760 --> 06:30:01,060
Okay, I got one of them.

5470
06:30:04,600 --> 06:30:04,940
Oh, my God.

5471
06:30:05,140 --> 06:30:05,360
I made it.

5472
06:30:05,780 --> 06:30:06,160
Oh, my.

5473
06:30:06,220 --> 06:30:06,500
Okay.

5474
06:30:06,640 --> 06:30:09,320
Okay, I had to, like, trust the process for that.

5475
06:30:11,080 --> 06:30:13,780
I had to trust the process.

5476
06:30:15,980 --> 06:30:20,440
I swear to God, if I have another cookie shit thing right
here, I swear to fucking God.

5477
06:30:26,080 --> 06:30:27,180
Our electric floors.

06:30:30,100 --> 06:30:31,140
Oh my god.

5479
06:30:32,300 --> 06:30:34,380
MP1 with the rock roll floor.

5480
06:30:40,490 --> 06:30:42,770
I'll grab the scooby snack while I'm here.

5481
06:30:45,550 --> 06:30:54,810
I swear to God, if I see 900 cookies, oh my God, I swear to

There you go.

5484
06:31:20,740 --> 06:31:21,900
Where the fuck do I go?

5485
06:31:21,980 --> 06:31:22,620
Oh, it's here.

06:31:25,860 --> 06:31:27,740
Oh, how long to be said seven hours?

5487
06:31:27,860 --> 06:31:28,660
I'm still on track.

5488
06:31:29,200 --> 06:31:30,460
I'm still on track.

5489
06:31:32,100 --> 06:31:33,400
I was doing the video.

5490
06:31:33,600 --> 06:31:35,000
I didn't do the Google part this time.

5491
06:31:35,180 --> 06:31:39,880
Usually I would Google it, but I was just like, I'll just
look at the YouTube video because an adult is playing it.

5492
06:31:40,240 --> 06:31:42,680
But silly me, that adult knows what the fuck is going on.

5493
06:31:42,740 --> 06:31:43,220
I don't.

5494
06:31:47,380 --> 06:31:49,920
Because I was like, okay, this is a kid's game.

5495
06:31:50,160 --> 06:31:55,100
So like, I need the most accurate representation if I watch
an adult try and figure this out.

5496
06:31:58,980 --> 06:31:59,380
How?

5497
06:32:01,700 --> 06:32:04,360
Oh my god, the table is electrified too.

5498
06:32:05,060 --> 06:32:07,900
Oh my god, the table was...

5499
06:32:07,900 --> 06:32:08,540
Oh, okay.

5500
06:32:10,580 --> 06:32:13,560
I didn't think the table was also gonna be electric.

5501
06:32:13,900 --> 06:32:18,580
Like, who the fuck makes the table have electricity?

5502
06:32:21,540 --> 06:32:24,040
Oh my god, let's do this again.

5503
06:32:29,960 --> 06:32:32,120
I thought table was safe.

5504
06:32:34,620 --> 06:32:37,360
Oh, whoa, whoa, look at that speedrun tech right there.

5505
06:32:42,400 --> 06:32:42,620
All right.

5506
06:32:48,620 --> 06:32:53,120
Yeah, I was like, is that not a wooden table in front of me?

5507
06:32:55,040 --> 06:32:56,760
Where the fuck do I go?

5508
06:33:00,400 --> 06:33:03,020
Do I have to backtrack all the way back there?

5509
06:33:07,580 --> 06:33:08,740
All right, where does it go?

5510
06:33:09,960 --> 06:33:11,300
Oh my god, it's at the entrance.

5511
06:33:11,440 --> 06:33:12,800
It's all the way back at the entrance.

5512
06:33:18,760 --> 06:33:20,920
I hope I see the goddamn hospital bed.

5513
06:33:21,080 --> 06:33:21,700
Okay, there we go.

5514
06:33:21,840 --> 06:33:25,240
I was gonna say, I hope I see the fucking hospital bed when
I...

5515
06:33:25,240 --> 06:33:28,380
I hope I'll be able to see the hospital bed when I jump to
the other side.

5516
06:33:29,280 --> 06:33:30,260
Thank God, okay.

5517
06:33:31,360 --> 06:33:34,480
I was gonna be very, very mad.

5518
06:33:41,190 --> 06:33:42,070
No way.

5519
06:33:42,850 --> 06:33:43,590
Okay, okay.

5520
06:33:43,890 --> 06:33:44,970
Is it salvageable?

5521
06:33:45,830 --> 06:33:46,710
It's salvageable.

5522
06:33:47,510 --> 06:33:48,430
I just got...

5523
06:33:48,430 --> 06:33:48,870
Okay.

5524
06:33:49,550 --> 06:33:50,150
Okay, okay.

06:33:57,330 --> 06:34:00,150
That it was scary.

5529
06:34:00,650 --> 06:34:11,490
I can't believe it There I can't see anything because I
can't move!

5530
06:34:11,870 --> 06:34:13,810
I can't move the camera

5531
06:34:17,250 --> 06:34:23,230
Oh my god, you guys don't understand the camera is immovable

5532
06:34:31,180 --> 06:34:34,360
Oh my god, there was a button over there.

5533
06:34:38,060 --> 06:34:41,580
I didn't even see those buttons.

5534
06:34:56,280 --> 06:34:57,260
There's no way.

5535
06:35:07,700 --> 06:35:09,200
There's that button over there.

5536
06:35:13,500 --> 06:35:18,140
Oh my god, there's the fucking thing over there too.

5551
06:38:13,990 --> 06:38:15,770
Oh my god.

5552
06:38:16,230 --> 06:38:18,050
Oh my god.

5553
06:38:21,230 --> 06:38:24,270
They're actually fully unsinked.

5554
06:38:31,000 --> 06:38:32,280
Oh my god.

5555
06:38:32,620 --> 06:38:32,620
Okay.

5556
06:38:32,840 --> 06:38:33,060
Okay.

5557
06:38:33,180 --> 06:38:34,520
We got a lock-in for this.

5558
06:38:39,200 --> 06:38:41,060
I'm just gonna wait for the pattern.

5559
06:38:42,740 --> 06:38:43,300
Oh my.

5560
06:38:47,290 --> 06:38:48,770
This is...

5561
06:38:48,770 --> 06:38:49,990
This is torture.

5562
06:38:52,070 --> 06:38:52,710
Holy fuck.

5563
06:38:54,990 --> 06:38:55,730
Fuck.

5564
06:38:58,410 --> 06:39:00,550
What the fuck?

5565
06:39:01,490 --> 06:39:04,170
Why did it go away so?

5566
06:39:04,790 --> 06:39:04,970
this.

5567
06:39:05,290 --> 06:39:06,530
What is that?

5568
06:39:06,950 --> 06:39:07,170
What?

5569
06:39:24,360 --> 06:39:27,520
That was actually so cruel.

5570
06:39:29,240 --> 06:39:30,000
No way.

5571
06:39:35,520 --> 06:39:38,660
At least she didn't die, guys.

5572
06:39:46,030 --> 06:39:47,130
This is actually torture.

5573
06:39:48,770 --> 06:39:50,570
This is parkour.

5574
06:39:50,930 --> 06:39:59,730
I think the fact that they're not synced up is like they're
so like off-sync it fucks with me so much like even when

5575
06:39:59,730 --> 06:40:10,950
they're stopping too I think the worst part is that when
they're stopping is the timing is so fucking weird will you

5576
06:40:10,950 --> 06:40:29,230
jump where the beef or the chicken like like what are some
of the what is that okay like what is that okay like it goes

5577
06:40:29,230 --> 06:40:39,070
what it stops there for a while but when it comes back
that's fucked up oh

5578
06:40:44,090 --> 06:40:52,810
my god oh my god okay I could I should have just floated
stop stop this stop

5579
06:40:57,560 --> 06:40:58,000

Okay, we're done.

5581
06:41:01,880 --> 06:41:04,460
Let's stop this at once.

5582
06:41:09,740 --> 06:41:11,080
Whoa, run, Scooby.

Oh my god, it's him.

5585
06:41:13,180 --> 06:41:13,840
It's the cyborg.

5586
06:41:17,930 --> 06:41:19,650
Oh, I'm glad it did not crash.

5587
06:41:19,730 --> 06:41:20,570
No, I thought so too.

5588
06:41:20,690 --> 06:41:22,110
I felt it.

5589
06:41:22,190 --> 06:41:24,590
I was like, please tell me it's okay.

5590
06:41:27,790 --> 06:41:28,550
Oh, okay.

5591
06:41:28,670 --> 06:41:28,950

5592
06:41:29,670 --> 06:41:30,150
Oh, okay.

5593
06:41:30,430 --> 06:41:31,210
That's okay.

5594
06:41:31,550 --> 06:41:31,570
Cool.

5595
06:41:36,510 --> 06:41:38,190

5600
06:41:52,470 --> 06:41:54,690
Can I not kill these guys?

5601
06:41:56,750 --> 06:41:57,850
Okay, it's not activated.

5602
06:41:58,050 --> 06:41:58,250
Okay.

A freebie.

5605
06:42:06,750 --> 06:42:07,390
Yay!

5606
06:42:07,870 --> 06:42:09,750
It didn't activate, guys!

5607
06:42:10,150 --> 06:42:11,250
It bugged out!

5608
06:42:11,350 --> 06:42:11,930

5609
06:42:12,130 --> 06:42:12,850
Oh, there, never mind.

5610
06:42:16,570 --> 06:42:18,950

Okay.

5612
06:42:24,160 --> 06:42:25,080

5613
06:42:27,820 --> 06:42:28,320
Ooh, snacks.

5614
06:42:31,300 --> 06:42:32,960
No, we don't need it.

5615
06:42:36,160 --> 06:42:36,800
Alright.

5616
06:42:37,360 --> 06:42:38,120
Up we go.

5617
06:42:43,970 --> 06:42:45,390
What the fuck?

5618
06:42:46,210 --> 06:42:46,350
What?

5619
06:42:47,370 --> 06:42:47,850

06:42:49,890 --> 06:42:51,210
Okay, that's cool.

5622
06:42:52,410 --> 06:42:53,410
That's cool.

5623
06:42:54,370 --> 06:42:55,750
Guys, can you stop lasering?

5624
06:42:55,990 --> 06:42:57,290

5625
06:42:57,290 --> 06:42:58,350

Oh, wait, I stopped here.

5628
06:43:00,950 --> 06:43:01,810
Oh, my God.

5629
06:43:04,130 --> 06:43:04,850
Is that not?

5630
06:43:05,570 --> 06:43:07,570
Wait, they're unbounceable.

5631
06:43:07,710 --> 06:43:08,010
Wait.

5632
06:43:09,110 --> 06:43:11,470
These guys are actually unbounceable.

5633
06:43:12,090 --> 06:43:12,570
Oh.

5634
06:43:12,590 --> 06:43:14,590
Oh my god, it's fully glitched!

06:43:14,750 --> 06:43:15,030
Let's go!

5636
06:43:16,570 --> 06:43:17,510
If I...

5637
06:43:17,510 --> 06:43:18,250
Oh, never mind.

5638
06:43:19,910 --> 06:43:22,390
I thought I figured it out, guys.

5639
06:43:25,010 --> 06:43:26,670
I thought I was so clever.

5640
06:43:26,890 --> 06:43:27,930
I thought I figured it out.

5641
06:43:33,120 --> 06:43:33,460
Here.

5642
06:43:34,900 --> 06:43:36,120
I hit this one.

5643
06:43:37,620 --> 06:43:38,100
Is that all?

5644
06:43:38,840 --> 06:43:39,540
There we go.

5645
06:43:40,680 --> 06:43:42,460

5651
06:44:25,120 --> 06:44:29,720
I should have to go use this platform so I can get this
button and not press that button.

5652
06:44:30,560 --> 06:44:32,220
And then the door opens.

06:46:15,240 --> 06:46:15,780
Is that...

5670
06:46:15,800 --> 06:46:17,300
Oh my god, it's over there.

5671
06:46:17,360 --> 06:46:18,440
I see it.

5672
06:46:20,140 --> 06:46:22,300
Oh my god, it was here.

5673
06:46:23,600 --> 06:46:24,880
It's a warp gate.

5674
06:46:25,020 --> 06:46:26,180
Oh my god.

5675
06:46:26,740 --> 06:46:30,340

I've never felt pure anguish before.

5680
06:47:01,210 --> 06:47:05,630
I've never felt pure anguish until today.

5681
06:47:06,610 --> 06:47:09,970
The economy is in shambles right now.

5682
06:47:14,550 --> 06:47:16,950
Oh, man.

Not even 800.

5685
06:47:25,150 --> 06:47:31,190
The fact that it's 850, they had to add the end.

5693
06:48:45,420 --> 06:48:46,400
Just from this area.

06:48:47,780 --> 06:48:48,980
That's so silly of me.

5695
06:48:49,580 --> 06:48:50,380
How foolish.

5696
06:48:50,560 --> 06:48:51,640
It's never over.

06:48:54,520 --> 06:48:56,660
You're so silly dokey.

5699
06:48:57,860 --> 06:48:59,320
It's never over.

5700
06:49:00,780 --> 06:49:02,760
Oh my god, look at all those scooby snacks.

5701
06:49:02,920 --> 06:49:03,780
That's just...

5702
06:49:04,740 --> 06:49:06,120
That's just lying.

06:49:06,180 --> 06:49:09,360

Actually, no.

5711
06:49:57,440 --> 06:49:58,420
I think there's one more over there.

5712
06:49:58,620 --> 06:49:59,640
Wait, let me just go over there.

5713
06:50:00,200 --> 06:50:01,920
I think there's more behind me.

5714
06:50:05,840 --> 06:50:07,040
The end is never.

5715
06:50:07,420 --> 06:50:10,200
I thought that was the last one.

5716
06:50:11,320 --> 06:50:13,040
I didn't know.

5717
06:50:14,520 --> 06:50:16,040
There'd be more.

5718
06:50:17,640 --> 06:50:19,160
There'd be so...

5719
06:50:19,260 --> 06:50:20,860
much more.

5720
06:50:21,560 --> 06:50:22,120
Alright.

5721
06:50:24,140 --> 06:50:24,800
Alright.

Me too.

5724
06:50:33,080 --> 06:50:33,740
Okay.

06:51:33,080 --> 06:51:34,960

We're gonna make it a 600.

5739
06:51:41,380 --> 06:51:42,020

5742
06:51:52,300 --> 06:51:53,200
I don't need 300.

5743
06:51:53,660 --> 06:51:54,820

5800
06:55:03,940 --> 06:55:05,860

5803
06:55:14,000 --> 06:55:15,080
But I was wrong.

5804
06:55:15,580 --> 06:55:16,780
It was no light.

5805
06:55:19,640 --> 06:55:23,140
Someone just left their iPhone on.

5806
06:55:24,160 --> 06:55:26,000
In the middle of the hallway.

5807
06:55:27,260 --> 06:55:28,560
There was no light.

5808
06:55:36,010 --> 06:55:36,570
Right here.

5809
06:55:38,870 --> 06:55:40,110
I need to lead one of them here.

5810
06:55:40,410 --> 06:55:40,730
Oh my god.

5811
06:55:40,970 --> 06:55:42,290
God damn stupid ghost.

5812
06:55:43,910 --> 06:55:44,930
Oh my god.

5813
06:55:48,370 --> 06:55:49,350
It's fine.

5814
06:55:50,090 --> 06:55:51,070
It's fine.

5815
06:55:53,310 --> 06:55:55,510
I just need a ghost to come over here.

5816
06:56:01,970 --> 06:56:02,550
Come on.

5817
06:56:03,470 --> 06:56:04,090
Come on.

5818
06:56:04,590 --> 06:56:06,030
Okay, well, that's not it.

5819
06:56:09,330 --> 06:56:10,170
Don't worry, I'll get unstuck.

5820
06:56:10,350 --> 06:56:10,850
There we go.

5821
06:56:13,170 --> 06:56:13,810
There we go, that's fine.

5822
06:56:15,110 --> 06:56:17,110
And then there was something at the bottom, right?

5823
06:56:19,510 --> 06:56:22,130
I know I left some Scooby Snacks in the bottom.

5824
06:56:23,310 --> 06:56:23,870
There we go.

5825
06:56:24,830 --> 06:56:26,090
That one Scooby Snack.

5826
06:56:30,500 --> 06:56:32,720
And then there was something over here.

5827
06:56:41,320 --> 06:56:42,340
Wait, what?

5828
06:56:43,440 --> 06:56:45,140
How the fuck do I get this?

5829
06:56:45,240 --> 06:56:45,940
Oh, here you go.

5830
06:56:51,200 --> 06:56:52,000
Oh, there we go.

5831
06:56:54,360 --> 06:56:55,180
That's a token.

5832
06:56:56,780 --> 06:56:57,400
Oh, my...

5833
06:56:57,400 --> 06:56:58,920
Oh, it's just that.

5834
06:56:59,040 --> 06:56:59,320
Okay.

5835
06:57:00,620 --> 06:57:03,280
The monster token should give me, like, plus 100.

5836
06:57:03,700 --> 06:57:05,020
100 Scooby snacks.

5837
06:57:05,340 --> 06:57:06,260
They're so rare.

5838
06:57:07,300 --> 06:57:10,020
They're so rare, I should get 100 Scooby snacks for that.

5839
06:57:10,040 --> 06:57:15,980
The hunt continues for more Scooby Snacks.

5840
06:57:26,380 --> 06:57:27,300
Alright.

5841
06:57:32,130 --> 06:57:33,430
It's okay.

5842
06:57:37,900 --> 06:57:38,120
No.

5843
06:57:42,430 --> 06:57:42,910
Oh my god.

5844
06:57:42,970 --> 06:57:44,210
We did it.

5845
06:57:44,230 --> 06:57:44,550
No!

5846
06:57:45,990 --> 06:57:46,290
Oh!

5847
06:57:46,910 --> 06:57:47,330
No!

5848
06:57:47,690 --> 06:57:49,550
Okay, we did it.

5849

Bubble power

6028
07:11:52,830 --> 07:12:02,090
Okay Oh, whoa, whoa How the fuck how did I

6029
07:12:05,190 --> 07:12:08,080
how did I do this?

6030
07:12:14,270 --> 07:12:14,890
Okay,

6031
07:12:19,620 --> 07:12:29,560

jump one time never again I

6032
07:12:33,720 --> 07:12:34,560
Okay, there you go.

6033
07:12:34,900 --> 07:12:35,140
There you go.

6034
07:12:35,280 --> 07:12:35,400
There you go.

6035
07:12:35,520 --> 07:12:35,980
I fixed it.

6036
07:12:41,680 --> 07:12:42,220
It's okay.

6037
07:12:42,300 --> 07:12:43,340
It's been fixed.

6038
07:12:46,120 --> 07:12:46,840
All right.

6039
07:12:49,000 --> 07:12:50,020
Every path is intended.

6040
07:12:53,600 --> 07:12:53,700
Oh!

6041
07:12:58,310 --> 07:12:59,690
It's just super buggy.

6042
07:13:02,870 --> 07:13:03,890
Oh my god, there it is.

6043
07:13:04,290 --> 07:13:05,070
It must be the button.

6044
07:13:05,150 --> 07:13:06,070
The button is here somewhere.

6045
07:13:10,680 --> 07:13:12,500
But in this here, I can feel it.

6046
07:13:19,030 --> 07:13:20,170
Okay, I can...

6047
07:13:22,130 --> 07:13:24,310
Okay, cannot miss.

6048
07:13:29,010 --> 07:13:30,710
Okay, and now what?

6049
07:13:33,230 --> 07:13:34,090
What the...

6050
07:13:34,090 --> 07:13:37,690
Okay, now what does he want me to do?

6051
07:13:44,760 --> 07:13:46,260
I assume I swing this way?

6052
07:13:46,900 --> 07:13:48,580
Are you fucking kidding me?

6053
07:13:55,500 --> 07:13:57,380
Okay, float over to the witch.

6054
07:13:57,580 --> 07:13:58,980
I assume that's what I have to do then.

6055
07:14:04,160 --> 07:14:06,460
Okay, but what if I just...

6056
07:14:07,140 --> 07:14:08,060
Can I blow up Bubba?

6057
07:14:08,200 --> 07:14:08,880
Okay, fuck this.

6058
07:14:09,920 --> 07:14:10,320
Goodbye.

6059
07:14:14,620 --> 07:14:15,360
It's okay.

6060
07:14:15,820 --> 07:14:18,440
I'd rather just die so I don't have to worry about...

6061
07:14:18,460 --> 07:14:20,700
having to travel back.

6062
07:14:26,020 --> 07:14:27,330
Okay, that's fine.

6063
07:14:33,220 --> 07:14:35,140
That still hits me!

6064
07:14:35,300 --> 07:14:36,360
Okay, no, no, no, no.

6065
07:14:36,420 --> 07:14:37,180
We can do this.

6066
07:14:40,840 --> 07:14:40,960
Rummy.

6067
07:14:46,080 --> 07:14:46,860

07:14:52,550 --> 07:14:54,430

6071
07:14:55,290 --> 07:14:56,350

6072
07:14:56,650 --> 07:14:57,110

07:15:32,270 --> 07:15:34,070
I don't know which urns I can break.

6079
07:15:34,470 --> 07:15:35,230
Is it the blue ones?

6080
07:15:35,350 --> 07:15:36,670
Oh, it was the blue ones.

6081
07:15:37,750 --> 07:15:40,450

07:27:52,020 --> 07:27:52,780
What the fuck?

6256
07:27:52,800 --> 07:27:53,200
Rashing?

6257
07:27:54,640 --> 07:27:55,580
Come on, Scooby.

6258
07:27:55,780 --> 07:27:56,520
You can do it.

6259
07:27:56,740 --> 07:27:58,740
We're almost at the end of this mystery.

6260
07:27:59,640 --> 07:28:00,960
And I've got a plan.

6261
07:28:01,140 --> 07:28:03,080
His Daphne 2 is my original character.

6262
07:28:04,800 --> 07:28:05,140
Go?

6263
07:28:07,620 --> 07:28:09,420
That's my original character.

6264
07:28:09,520 --> 07:28:10,500
Daphne 2.

6265
07:28:11,040 --> 07:28:12,520
Oh my god.

6266
07:28:13,000 --> 07:28:14,040
Okay, at least I can save.

6267
07:28:14,960 --> 07:28:17,320
Like, what am I looking at?

6268
07:28:17,620 --> 07:28:25,780
What am I looking at?

6269
07:28:27,940 --> 07:28:31,840
Okay, the final platforming.

6270
07:28:32,440 --> 07:28:35,640
Oh my god, I just instant, I instant that.

6271
07:28:36,220 --> 07:28:38,380
There's no second chances for Scooby-Doo.

6272
07:28:44,110 --> 07:28:46,530
Yeah, I'm just gonna float right over it.

6273
07:28:46,670 --> 07:28:47,710
Yeah, hello

6274
07:28:51,630 --> 07:28:59,930
I'm not attempting that second jump Yeah The acid in those
vats is used for etching.

6275
07:29:00,150 --> 07:29:06,790
It was used to make those funky lenses that were in my
glasses This must be part of the professor's top-secret

6276
07:29:06,790 --> 07:29:15,210
invention Jinkies and now I know just what it is the
professor was making super for real holograms.

6277
07:29:15,310 --> 07:29:16,890
Those, no, no, no.

6278
07:29:17,470 --> 07:29:20,310
There is no way that's a hologram.

6279
07:29:21,150 --> 07:29:24,790
Oh my God, that's how, bro, this was before the two-pack
hologram, guys.

6280
07:29:25,670 --> 07:29:26,310
That's crazy.

6281
07:29:26,930 --> 07:29:28,290
This was before two-pack.

6282
07:29:30,730 --> 07:29:35,170
Super there's no way those were holograms.

6283
07:29:35,190 --> 07:29:35,810
That's right, Scooby.

6284
07:29:36,250 --> 07:29:37,050
No ghosts.

6285
07:29:37,590 --> 07:29:38,490
Now listen up, gang.

6286
07:29:38,810 --> 07:29:41,510
We literally saw them lift Shaggy up.

6287
07:29:41,890 --> 07:29:44,270
Who the fuck was carrying Shaggy.

6288
07:29:45,030 --> 07:29:49,750
And that will buy us all the time we need to turn the tables
on old fright face.

6289
07:29:50,430 --> 07:29:53,010
Oh my god, her name was Holly Graham.

6290
07:29:54,490 --> 07:29:56,150
Oh my god.

6291
07:29:56,630 --> 07:29:58,130
My original OC.

6292
07:29:58,830 --> 07:29:59,990
Holly Graham.

6293
07:30:01,450 --> 07:30:01,670
Oh.

6294
07:30:02,630 --> 07:30:04,990
How about a whole box of Scooby snacks?

6295
07:30:05,230 --> 07:30:06,670
A whole box.

6296
07:30:06,750 --> 07:30:07,830
That better be 900.

6297
07:30:07,850 --> 07:30:10,210
That better be 900 Scooby snacks, guys.

6298
07:30:10,530 --> 07:30:10,970
Right.

6299
07:30:15,400 --> 07:30:18,820

Mastermind.

6310
07:30:40,660 --> 07:30:42,040

6311
07:30:42,460 --> 07:30:44,060

respawn

6379
07:36:59,350 --> 07:37:00,790
Okay, okay.

6380
07:37:01,190 --> 07:37:01,730
Okay, that's fine.

6381
07:37:02,430 --> 07:37:03,350
That's fine.

6382
07:37:04,470 --> 07:37:04,910
Okay.

6383
07:37:06,390 --> 07:37:09,130
It's just animal cruelty right now.

6384
07:37:09,650 --> 07:37:10,770
It truly is.

6385
07:37:11,270 --> 07:37:12,410
It really is.

6386
07:37:22,150 --> 07:37:22,630
Ooh.

6387
07:37:29,540 --> 07:37:32,740

Stop.

6390
07:37:42,460 --> 07:37:44,340
This is not fair.

6391
07:37:46,940 --> 07:37:47,660
Please!

6392
07:37:49,280 --> 07:37:50,320

07:40:44,620 --> 07:40:45,460

6439
07:41:12,160 --> 07:41:12,400
Oh, my God.

Okay, I tried to use the bubble, but it wouldn't let me.

6444
07:41:24,280 --> 07:41:24,720
No!

6445
07:41:24,720 --> 07:41:26,700

6446
07:41:26,980 --> 07:41:27,420
No,

6447
07:41:31,140 --> 07:41:31,820
I ran into him.

6448
07:41:31,820 --> 07:41:33,740
Bro, these guys spawned so fast.

6449
07:41:33,760 --> 07:41:43,020
fast after i kill them it's not worth killing them i've
noticed it's not worth killing this these guys because it's

6450
07:41:43,020 --> 07:41:52,400
like they just spawn back like in two seconds and they just
have to kill them for like loot like just of course he

6451
07:41:52,400 --> 07:42:00,590
spawns into me oh my god fucking worse

6452

to see all the food you can get

6453
07:42:11,520 --> 07:42:11,960
Okay.

6454
07:42:14,420 --> 07:42:16,320
This last one is so difficult.

6455
07:42:17,380 --> 07:42:19,220
I am a...

6456
07:42:31,420 --> 07:42:32,640
Okay, I didn't mean to do that.

6457
07:42:32,820 --> 07:42:35,280
Okay, this guy gets out first.

6458
07:42:38,080 --> 07:42:38,960
And then...

6459
07:42:38,960 --> 07:42:39,580
Okay.

6460
07:42:43,380 --> 07:42:43,980
There we go.

6461
07:42:46,040 --> 07:42:46,480
Okay.

6462
07:42:46,500 --> 07:42:49,500
Okay, we have to make sure the skellies don't spam.

6463
07:42:51,460 --> 07:42:51,560
All right.

6464
07:42:52,980 --> 07:42:54,020
All right.

6465
07:42:55,440 --> 07:42:56,440
All right, here we go.

6466
07:42:56,540 --> 07:42:59,600
I think it's easier to get more scooby snacks.

6467
07:43:01,240 --> 07:43:02,820
Please, please no more.

6468
07:43:03,820 --> 07:43:04,500
I don't want to watch.

6469
07:43:04,560 --> 07:43:06,740
I can't believe I can't skip the cutscene too.

6470
07:43:07,780 --> 07:43:08,860
Good morning from Germany.

6471
07:43:09,040 --> 07:43:10,760
Seems like we met again before the VOD.

6472
07:43:10,860 --> 07:43:11,380
Good luck, Doki.

6473
07:43:11,500 --> 07:43:12,240
Thank you again.

6474
07:43:12,620 --> 07:43:13,240
Thank you.

6475
07:43:13,340 --> 07:43:13,900
Super chat.

6476
07:43:14,000 --> 07:43:14,680
Thank you, stay there.

6477
07:43:15,260 --> 07:43:15,540
Okay.

6478
07:43:16,500 --> 07:43:17,500
We got this.

6479
07:43:19,040 --> 07:43:20,360
Are you...

6480
07:43:20,360 --> 07:43:22,640
Okay, that's not fair.

6481
07:43:23,300 --> 07:43:24,600
Guys, he's...

6482
07:43:24,600 --> 07:43:24,980
What?

6483
07:43:25,660 --> 07:43:26,960
What hit me?

6484
07:43:29,980 --> 07:43:30,240
Boogie.

6485
07:43:34,970 --> 07:43:36,270
Scooby Doo.

6486
07:43:37,450 --> 07:43:38,250
Yes!

6487
07:43:38,790 --> 07:43:39,470
Yes!

6488
07:43:41,870 --> 07:43:42,670
Oh my god.

6489
07:43:43,090 --> 07:43:45,870
It was just that easy.

6490
07:43:46,150 --> 07:43:47,170
It was just that easy.

6491
07:43:51,670 --> 07:43:57,570
Oh my god There we go

6492
07:44:03,140 --> 07:44:13,880
Oh my god I just needed one more hit Look gang There he is
Whoa Whoa Wow it's time to get to the bottom of this mystery

6493
07:44:13,880 --> 07:44:23,380
Come on gang Let's see who the mastermind really is Wait
Fred Like I think I know who this guy It's that spooky

6494
07:44:23,380 --> 07:44:24,820
groundskeeper, right?

6495
07:44:25,100 --> 07:44:27,260
It's always the groundskeeper.

6496
07:44:27,400 --> 07:44:28,420
Oh yeah, that's right.

6497
07:44:28,780 --> 07:44:30,440
Blame the spooky groundskeeper.

6498
07:44:31,000 --> 07:44:33,080
It's always the spooky groundskeeper.

6499
07:44:33,840 --> 07:44:34,980
Bro, he's just chilling.

6500
07:44:35,260 --> 07:44:36,440
He gave us free shit.

6501
07:44:36,460 --> 07:44:38,200
What do people have against groundskeepers?

6502
07:44:39,460 --> 07:44:40,420
Some detectives.

6503
07:44:41,420 --> 07:44:43,720
Why don't you just say the butler do it?

6504
07:44:44,240 --> 07:44:48,140
But no, it's always got to be the groundskeeper, don't it?

6505
07:44:48,140 --> 07:44:48,620
Yeah.

6506
07:44:48,760 --> 07:44:51,200
Anytime some ghost scares somebody.

6507
07:44:51,220 --> 07:44:52,360
That's ground sis!

6508
07:44:53,300 --> 07:44:55,720
It's just got to be the groundskeeper.

6509
07:44:56,360 --> 07:45:00,120
Like we couldn't just put up a sign that says keep off the
grass.

6510
07:45:00,760 --> 07:45:05,040
Nah, I'll just get myself a big old rubber monster suit.

6511
07:45:05,880 --> 07:45:12,660
Um, as I was saying, let's see who the mastermind really is.

6512
07:45:13,500 --> 07:45:15,900
It's Professor Alexander Graham!

6513
07:45:16,180 --> 07:45:17,500
It's Alexander Graham!

6514
07:45:17,920 --> 07:45:18,720
Oh my.

6515
07:45:19,200 --> 07:45:20,780
Uncle Alexander.

6516
07:45:21,220 --> 07:45:31,160
not holly leave it i knew it all the time it's not holly
grab just doesn't add up yeah you ask me someone's playing a

6517
07:45:31,160 --> 07:45:44,480
nasty trick a trick of the i knew it holly graham i knew it
wow that was just another hologram holly what are you doing

6518
07:45:44,480 --> 07:45:51,740
there zoinks but holly's right what they never try to True?

6519
07:45:51,920 --> 07:45:52,720
Wrong, Shecky.

6520
07:45:53,080 --> 07:45:55,240
That Holly was just another hologram.

6521
07:45:56,740 --> 07:46:00,180
The real Holly has been the mastermind the entire time.

6522
07:46:00,220 --> 07:46:00,720
I knew it.

6523
07:46:00,800 --> 07:46:02,060
I fucking knew it.

6524
07:46:02,520 --> 07:46:03,580
Think about the clues.

6525
07:46:05,620 --> 07:46:06,300
I call it.

6526
07:46:06,440 --> 07:46:08,060
Holly said she followed all of our cases.

6527
07:46:08,960 --> 07:46:12,480
But they respect women.

6528
07:46:15,720 --> 07:46:18,020
When the fuck does that happen?

6529
07:46:18,800 --> 07:46:26,020
By setting up a hologram of herself when the mastermind was
around she'd have the perfect alibi but what I don't get is

6530
07:46:26,020 --> 07:46:34,280
how she got the professor here in a mastermind costume no
less well that's simple she used my patent-pending dressed

6531
07:46:34,280 --> 07:46:40,220
for supper suck you up her I spent so much time in the lab
that I built a device that could get me dressed and to the

6532
07:46:40,220 --> 07:46:47,660
front door in seconds it actually happened in the cutscene
that's crazy that is actually Nice foreshadowing.

6533
07:46:50,400 --> 07:46:54,900
Holly must have used it to get here ahead of us and switch
places with her uncle.

6534
07:46:55,680 --> 07:46:57,620
Who she'd already stopped up there.

6535
07:46:58,540 --> 07:47:00,900
It was very uncomfortable, let me tell you.

6536
07:47:01,600 --> 07:47:04,280
Like and don't forget the most important clue of all.

6537
07:47:04,700 --> 07:47:05,580
Holly Graham!

6538
07:47:06,260 --> 07:47:06,700
Get it?

6539
07:47:06,840 --> 07:47:07,340
Holla Graham!

6540
07:47:07,340 --> 07:47:07,800
Yeah!

6541
07:47:11,620 --> 07:47:13,120
But why, Holly?

6542
07:47:13,160 --> 07:47:13,860
Yeah, why?

6543
07:47:13,940 --> 07:47:15,360
Why go through all of this?

6544
07:47:16,360 --> 07:47:23,300
You guys would have caught my uncle and when he was sent to
jail I'd steal his super hologram invention and claim I came

6545
07:47:23,300 --> 07:47:24,300
up with it myself.

6546
07:47:24,860 --> 07:47:29,640
I would have made a fortune too Yeah, what was it for you
meddling kids?

6547
07:47:30,660 --> 07:47:32,920
Yeah, and I would have gotten away with it too.

6548
07:47:33,080 --> 07:47:42,400
See the thing Whoa She said the thing Let me help you.

6549
07:47:42,660 --> 07:47:43,740
Oh, thank you kids.

6550
07:47:44,000 --> 07:47:50,320
I don't know how to repay you Well, all these middles are a
great start.

6551
07:47:51,500 --> 07:47:52,080
Hey!

6552
07:47:53,380 --> 07:47:55,360
We're not eating a foods hologram?

6553
07:47:56,240 --> 07:47:57,640
Scooby-Doby-Doo.

6554
07:47:58,760 --> 07:47:59,340
Yeah.

6555
07:48:01,000 --> 07:48:02,740
She said it.

6556
07:48:04,660 --> 07:48:06,800
Yeah, she's like their age.

6557
07:48:06,900 --> 07:48:07,980
You can't say that.

6558
07:48:15,600 --> 07:48:17,140
What is...

6559
07:48:17,140 --> 07:48:17,680
What?

6560
07:48:19,980 --> 07:48:21,460
What is this?

6561
07:48:21,960 --> 07:48:23,700
What is this remix?

6562
07:48:24,580 --> 07:48:25,560
Bro, am I?

6563
07:48:27,140 --> 07:48:28,620
What is this?

6564
07:48:29,680 --> 07:48:30,680
Electronic remix.

6565
07:48:31,000 --> 07:48:32,980
This was before dead mouse time.

6566
07:48:33,340 --> 07:48:34,940
Yeah, this is techno shit.

6567
07:48:36,920 --> 07:48:37,080
Yeah.

6568
07:48:37,820 --> 07:48:41,160
I'm at the club now.

6569
07:48:41,660 --> 07:48:43,820
Going to the club after solving the mystery.

6570
07:48:47,240 --> 07:48:49,040
It's time for the rave.

6571
07:48:49,660 --> 07:48:51,420
After a good mystery case.

6572
07:48:51,540 --> 07:48:51,940
Sorry.

6573
07:48:51,960 --> 07:48:54,160
Oh, case closed.

6574
07:48:55,400 --> 07:48:56,740
Bring the dog to the grave.

6575
07:48:57,520 --> 07:48:57,700
Bum.

6576
07:48:58,680 --> 07:49:00,020
Bum, bum, bum, bum.

6577
07:49:03,200 --> 07:49:04,700
EDM Scooby-Doo.

6578
07:49:05,180 --> 07:49:06,940
Bum, bum, bum, bum.

6579
07:49:09,060 --> 07:49:10,700
Yeah, the squirrel legs.

6580
07:49:10,840 --> 07:49:12,020
I was like thinking that.

6581
07:49:12,060 --> 07:49:13,700
I was like, I have squirrel legs are dead now.

6582
07:49:13,920 --> 07:49:16,520
This feels so like squirrel legs right now.

6583
07:49:17,680 --> 07:49:21,040
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

6584
07:49:23,200 --> 07:49:24,340
That was fun.

6585
07:49:24,500 --> 07:49:25,960
That was a nice revisit challenge.

6586
07:49:26,480 --> 07:49:34,000
I forgot back then, like, because a lot of these games where
collectathons and, like, platformers, they made you force

6587
07:49:34,000 --> 07:49:36,860
you to collect so much.

6588
07:49:37,380 --> 07:49:37,580
Yeah.

6589
07:49:39,200 --> 07:49:44,740
That was just, I, that's why, that's why Little Jokey never
finished this game.

6590
07:49:46,240 --> 07:49:47,280
She was stuck.

6591
07:49:47,580 --> 07:49:49,800
She did not collect the Scooby Snacks.

6592
07:49:52,500 --> 07:50:02,240
I finally beat it for little dokey right now they could get
for their 10 gift of chips they could thank you oh it was

6593
07:50:02,240 --> 07:50:08,240
fun though I felt like it was very well written like it felt
like a Scooby-Doo episode that's why I always want I want to

6594
07:50:08,240 --> 07:50:13,840
play this Futurama game too because everyone says the
Futurama game is also really good and it's like a Futurama

6595
07:50:13,840 --> 07:50:20,300
episode same with Simpsons I want to play the Simpsons game
as well the one with the the one where you go to heaven and

6596
07:50:20,300 --> 07:50:23,920
then uh and I know the plot twist because I did play it
before.

6597
07:50:24,360 --> 07:50:25,420
I did play the Simpsons game.

6598
07:50:25,520 --> 07:50:26,240
It was really fun.

6599
07:50:26,340 --> 07:50:28,540
I remembered when I played it when I was little.

6600
07:50:30,320 --> 07:50:36,700
I really want to do the PS2 Futurama and the Simpsons game
where you go to the Simpsons fight heaven.

6601
07:50:40,660 --> 07:50:41,780
We did do Hit and Run.

6602
07:50:41,880 --> 07:50:43,300
Hit and Run was a game I never played before.

6603
07:50:43,420 --> 07:50:44,860
That's what I really wanted to check it out.

6604
07:50:45,560 --> 07:50:47,360
It was like, it was in 2007 Simpsons.

6605
07:50:47,440 --> 07:50:48,740
That game was really fun too.

6606

Thank you, thank you.

6608
07:50:54,760 --> 07:50:57,580
Uh, I don't blame Lil Doki for not being in this game.

6609
07:50:57,680 --> 07:51:00,940
Big Doki had enough trouble with it.

6610
07:51:00,980 --> 07:51:06,180
Yeah, yeah, like present Doki was struggling hard with the
platforms.

6611

It was great going through the memory lane trying to
finishing this game.

6624
07:51:59,780 --> 07:52:01,100

07:55:24,180 --> 07:55:24,720

And then I go out back in.

07:56:02,970 --> 07:56:04,130
It is not gone.

07:56:05,070 --> 07:56:05,810
Oh my god.

6683
07:56:06,190 --> 07:56:07,390

6685
07:56:16,850 --> 07:56:18,090

Nah, it doesn't work.

6691
07:57:06,120 --> 07:57:07,700
Okay, he gave me a Wahi.

6692
07:57:08,260 --> 07:57:09,400
He gave me a Wahi.

6694
07:57:14,400 --> 07:57:16,980

6695
07:57:17,520 --> 07:57:18,100
Where does...

6696
07:57:18,100 --> 07:57:19,820
Okay, guys, I don't think it works.

6697
07:57:20,740 --> 07:57:21,580
It's too late.

6698
07:57:21,880 --> 07:57:22,220
All right.

6699
07:57:23,080 --> 07:57:24,040
He gave me a Wahi.

6700
07:57:24,420 --> 07:57:24,960
That's it.

6701
07:57:25,160 --> 07:57:27,100
They patched it.

6702
07:57:28,920 --> 07:57:37,740
In 2025, Scooby-Doo, 100 Frights, released a patch of after
20 plus years.

6703
07:57:42,140 --> 07:57:48,260
After 20 plus years, they've released a patch to get rid of
all Chico's.

6704
07:57:48,600 --> 07:57:50,060
They nerfed Wahi.

6705
07:57:54,440 --> 07:57:55,960
Anyway, I turned the link.

6706
07:57:56,060 --> 07:57:56,960
Welcome to tomato farm.

6707
07:57:57,260 --> 07:57:57,800
Welcome, welcome.

6708
07:57:58,500 --> 07:57:59,180
That was fun.

6709
07:57:59,260 --> 07:58:02,940
I still had a really fun time playing it.

6710
07:58:03,000 --> 07:58:04,680
Guys, I don't think it works, guys.

6711
07:58:04,940 --> 07:58:08,160
No matter where we warp, it ain't gonna take us in.

6712
07:58:08,280 --> 07:58:13,560
If they release the patches to prevent me, they wanted me to
gather more Scooby snacks.

6713
07:58:14,060 --> 07:58:15,360
But I refuse.

6714
07:58:16,080 --> 07:58:19,000
I refuse to gather more Scooby snacks.

6715
07:58:19,160 --> 07:58:20,120
I'm done.

6716
07:58:20,740 --> 07:58:22,320
Anyway, guys, I'm gonna call here.

6717
07:58:22,640 --> 07:58:25,460
I hope you all had a wonderful time watching.

6718
07:58:25,900 --> 07:58:30,580
I hope you had, um, how you guys enjoyed my company today.

6719
07:58:30,720 --> 07:58:33,020
We did stream a very long time.

6720
07:58:34,100 --> 07:58:36,260
Um, and, uh, I had so much fun playing it.

6721
07:58:36,320 --> 07:58:39,040
Going back to the nostalgia games and going back from my
childhood.

6722
07:58:39,940 --> 07:58:43,400
Uh, introducing you guys to the guys to the one of the games
I used to play growing up.

6723
07:58:43,600 --> 07:58:44,840
Uh, Pencil, thank you for the super chat.

6724
07:58:44,880 --> 07:58:45,040
Thank you.

6725
07:58:45,440 --> 07:58:48,180
I looked up, Tommy worked on this game as the music
composer.

6726
07:58:48,280 --> 07:58:50,400
He's the guy who tried to claim he made the way.

6727
07:58:50,740 --> 07:58:51,260
Really?

6728
07:58:51,720 --> 07:58:53,620
Oh my god, that's awkward.

6729
07:58:54,040 --> 07:58:58,040
Bro, okay, but he did make, didn't he make, actually make
the original Oof sound effect?

6730
07:58:58,340 --> 07:59:01,660
And he just wanted to be paid in like royalties for it or
some shit.

6731
07:59:02,500 --> 07:59:07,940
Um, but like, hey, the music was pretty good, despite him
taking away Oof in Roblox.

6732
07:59:08,140 --> 07:59:10,800
Anyway, guys, as always everybody, oh, he wasn't?

6733
07:59:10,920 --> 07:59:12,740
Okay, I didn't really know the full story.

6734
07:59:12,880 --> 07:59:17,860
I thought like, I just, I remember seeing the tweets about
it, but I didn't know the full story regarding the Oof.

6735
07:59:17,960 --> 07:59:18,580
He didn't?

6736
07:59:18,820 --> 07:59:20,120
He says a lot of things.

6737
07:59:20,120 --> 07:59:21,960
Tommy says a lot of things.

6738
07:59:22,020 --> 07:59:22,900
I don't know, Tommy.

6739
07:59:23,260 --> 07:59:25,340
I just saw, like, the tweets about it.

6740
07:59:25,720 --> 07:59:27,880
Oh, one of his employees made it.

6741
07:59:27,900 --> 07:59:28,420
Oh, he tried.

6742
07:59:28,480 --> 07:59:29,780
Oh, he's like Thomas Edison.

6743
07:59:30,360 --> 07:59:31,780
That's why his name is Tommy.

6744
07:59:32,020 --> 07:59:35,780
Thomas, my Edison, my Edison, my hero.

6745
07:59:36,300 --> 07:59:39,200
Yeah, that is a big oof.

6746
07:59:39,560 --> 07:59:43,040
Anyway, guys, as always, everybody, say hi, J-LiPotrists,
Posh Check.

6747
07:59:43,240 --> 07:59:44,740
Get him moving around and get that blood flowing.

6748
07:59:44,820 --> 07:59:48,000
And if you, except for me, head to bed, cause you deserve
it.
