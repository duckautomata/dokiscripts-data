1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:03,470
I think bandages are great.

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,450
They make me feel warm inside.

3
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,960
Commander, are we playing red light, green light?

4
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,840
I'll protect you, Commander.

5
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,060
Commander, Rappi, Anise, Neon, you're all the best!

6
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,880
I think bandages are great.

7
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,880
They make me feel warm inside.

8
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,140
Commander, Rappi, Anise, Neon, you're all the best!

9
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:05,890
Awaiting your command.

10
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,430
Danger is always around the corner.

11
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:16,270
Commander, how about you, Yumi, and I have some fun?

12
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,750
I like to have my body do the talking.

13
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:25,910
Commander, how about you- I don't believe there are enough viewers here.

14
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,790
I'm so beautiful today.

15
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,690
I like it.

16
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:31,570
Oh?

17
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,190
Did you need something?

18
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:38,050
I'm a bit preoccupied admiring myself in the mirror right now.

19
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,550
Just give in to it and free yourself.

20
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:51,410
Commander, how about you, Yumi, and I have some fun?

21
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,480
I don't believe there are enough viewers here.

22
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,100
I'm so beautiful today.

23
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,000
I like it.

24
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,260
I don't believe there are enough mirrors here.

25
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,280
Hello, everyone!

26
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,460
Hello, hello!

27
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,140
Welcome!

28
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,660
Oh, let me put this image on first.

29
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,060
Whoa!

30
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,100
Welcome, everybody!

31
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,520
I was just, you know, I was waiting, you know?

32
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,220
I just wanted to see what they'll say.

33
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:17,840
But welcome, everybody, to a Rare Doki Twitch stream!

34
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:18,860
Let's go!

35
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,780
Also, thank you for the five gifted subs, Marco!

36
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,100
Thank you, thank you!

37
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,060
I really appreciate it, guys!

38
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,740
So, today is a special stream, if you guys don't know.

39
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:36,440
It is Nikkei 2.5 Anniversary, and whenever they have a special event, you know you're gonna see a Doki bird!

40
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:46,120
It's actually crazy that it's been 2.5 years since Nikkei first came out.

41
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,740
It does not feel like this... I don't know.

42
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:53,060
It feels like this game has been out for a while now, but it's only been 2.5 years.

43
00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:00,680
And, like, we've been doing sponsors for Nikkei since the early access.

44
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,000
So, it's actually crazy to think about that.

45
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,720
It's, like, tradition now.

46
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,960
Like, every time there is a special event, I'll be here.

47
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:16,860
They hit me up for a sponsor to check out all the newest updates that it has to offer.

48
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:17,780
So, yeah!

49
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,020
Welcome, everybody!

50
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:23,080
So, also, if you guys don't know, it's pinned on the chat.

51
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,840
And also, there's, like, a little Nightbot is also doing a little timer thing.

52
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,440
But I should also... I should make a command right now.

53
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,220
Like, give me a sec.

54
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,400
Let me make a Nightbot command.

55
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,360
Where I made, like, a timer for it to, like, remind me.

56
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,520
But I believe... Let me see if I do this correctly.

57
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,420
Let's see.

58
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,520
Advanced settings.

59
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,120
All right.

60
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,380
Uh...

61
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,160
Uh...

62
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:45,860
Uh...

63
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:47,960
Uh...

64
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,800
Let's do Nikkei.

65
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,600
Okay, do an exclamation point...

66
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,480
Oh, wait, never mind.

67
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,060
Never mind.

68
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,380
Apparently, the command was already made.

69
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,680
Wait, it wasn't.

70
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,000
All right.

71
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,560
Let me make it right now.

72
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,080
Whoa!

73
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:00,800
I'm a professional!

74
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,520
All right.

75
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,580
Command will be Nikkei.

76
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,880
And then it would say...

77
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,820
What would it...

78
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,100
Oh, wait.

79
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,040
Wait.

80
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:10,860
Give me a sec.

81
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,500
Let me...

82
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:11,880
Sorry.

83
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,220
I knew I forgot something.

84
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,940
I knew it.

85
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,220
I knew I forgot something.

86
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,980
There's always one thing I forgot.

87
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:20,760
All right.

88
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:25,060
Let's make it so that we have, like, a 10-second cooldown for this.

89
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:25,600
All right.

90
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,340
So, if you use the command Nikkei, it will give you a link to, you know, my special link.

91
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,980
Where if you click it, you can get...

92
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,920
And you sign up for it.

93
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:38,280
You can get up to 160 free draws slash pulls.

94
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,160
Which is a lot if you think about it.

95
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,580
That gives you, like, you know, because, like, you can do 10 pulls.

96
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,960
Um, you have to progress the story, though.

97
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,620
If you wish to get more of the free pulls.

98
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,300
But it is a lot of pulls if you think about it.

99
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,920
Because, like, you can basically get, like, some of your, like, dream characters within, um...

100
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,360
Within, like, less than 100 pulls.

101
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,780
Um, if you're...

102
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,580
If you don't have bad luck like me recently.

103
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:02,540
Ahahaha!

104
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,920
But it's all gonna change today!

105
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,320
Ahahaha!

106
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,940
Today is where it's gonna change!

107
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:13,020
I will finally get the good characters!

108
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,340
Cause...

109
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:14,980
What was it?

110
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,380
What was that character I was trying to get last time?

111
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,140
That...

112
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,400
I end up...

113
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,480
I may not have gotten the other character from the two year.

114
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,960
I might not have gotten Asuka.

115
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,020
But!

116
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:25,640
But!

117
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,420
I got someone better than Asuka!

118
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,180
Hahahaha!

119
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,500
I might not have gotten her!

120
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,720
But I got someone better.

121
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:35,600
Ha ha!

122
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,640
I got..

123
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,580
I got blue Asuka!

124
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:39,860
hahahahaha!

125
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,480
Asuka, that's right.

126
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,300
Sorry, Asuka...

127
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,400
I got- I got someone better!

128
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,900
Anyway, sorry.

129
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,880
Um, every time I tab out of the game.

130
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,020
Like, she starts talking.

131
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,940
Our time into the game.

132
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,320
So that's what you heard.

133
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,100
Anyway, I got... You're right.

134
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,260
I got Modernia.

135
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,600
That's so much better.

136
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,060
That's who I... That's right.

137
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,460
You guys want to... That's right.

138
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,500
I got her.

139
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,380
Wait, no, that's Mihara.

140
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,840
I got... Where is she?

141
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,880
Where is she?

142
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,180
I got her.

143
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,240
See?

144
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,100
Asuka couldn't say that.

145
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:13,760
Look at that.

146
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,160
Look at that.

147
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,640
Oh my god, thank you.

148
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,220
Look, she called me the best, guys.

149
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,720
Wait... You don't need to see her.

150
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,320
You don't need to see her, chat.

151
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,140
All you have to do is hear her.

152
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,280
It's only for my eyes.

153
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,380
It's only for my eyes.

154
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:45,120
Anyway, so if you guys don't know, for the 2.5 year anniversary, they did release a new character called, I believe, the Little Mermaid.

155
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:54,720
And it's actually really funny because the dev... The staff, the devs, during, like, the sponsor briefing was like, she's broken.

156
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,780
And, um... So, they're like, you can tell, chat, that she's incredibly broken right now.

157
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:10,200
So, apparently, uh, Little Mermaid is incredibly strong.

158
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,420
And she surpasses some character named Lita.

159
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,520
Lita, I believe.

160
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,640
And, like, uh, you guys might know who she is.

161
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,020
I don't.

162
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,600
I just know by what they look like.

163
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:27,600
Um, but she is considered the strongest anniversary character, um, that's ever been launched.

164
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,520
So, um... So, she is incredibly busted.

165
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,480
And we're gonna see if we can get her.

166
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,760
And which we will, guys.

167
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,480
I swear to God.

168
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:42,020
I... We will not have a repeat of what happened last time.

169
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,200
We will get her this time, chat.

170
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:52,340
We... We are... We are gonna actually get the anniversary character.

171
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,580
My luck changes today.

172
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,000
I make my own luck.

173
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,200
Guys, it changes here.

174
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,760
Anyway, there's also, apparently, there's, um...

175
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:03,800
Uh...

176
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,440
What the fuck?

177
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:04,800
Wait.

178
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:05,620
Oh, wait.

179
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:06,120
Oh, my God.

180
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:06,860
I had a video play.

181
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,800
I was like, what the fuck?

182
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,100
Okay.

183
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,360
I had, like, a short playing in the background.

184
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,880
I was like, who's talking to me?

185
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,560
But you guys didn't hear.

186
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,040
Um... Also, there's, like, a lot of other new updates.

187
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,400
Since it is an anniversary update, there's a lot of other stuff.

188
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:22,400
So, apparently, Mihara got ascended into SSR.

189
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,660
Um... And they released a...

190
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,440
They released a free character, which you can get.

191
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,360
Which is Mori.

192
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,180
And she's also an SSR character.

193
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,320
And she's apparently free right now.

194
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,060
So, yeah.

195
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:40,080
If you guys want an SSR character without doing any pulls, this is the right time to get them now, during the anniversary.

196
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,740
And, like, all anniversary updates, they also give you free pulls.

197
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,360
So, like I said, there is...

198
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:46,940
Um...

199
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,980
There is a free...

200
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,340
There's up to 160 free pulls that you can get.

201
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,200
And, of course, there's, like, new character...

202
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:53,780
New skins.

203
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,080
Uh...

204
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,640
Reruns of limited skins that you're looking to get those.

205
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,620
And also, new stories.

206
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,400
Apparently, there's, like...

207
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,280
I realized that since this game's been out for 2.3...

208
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,740
Yeah, we all love free stuff, guys.

209
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,360
Like, come on.

210
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,360
Don't you guys want free stuff?

211
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:07,900
Free pulls.

212
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:20,800
I didn't realize that because this game has been out for 2.5 years, there's, like, 30-plus chapters now.

213
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,700
Like, obviously, every new update, they add, like, a new chapter for the game.

214
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,240
And, um...

215
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,620
Guess what chapter I'm on?

216
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm gonna get there eventually.

217
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,680
The amount of times they sponsor me...

218
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,920
Eventually, I will get to that chap...

219
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,340
I will get to chapter 30.

220
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,660
I am...

221
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,840
No, I'm actually on...

222
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,980
I'm actually halfway through chapter 4, guys.

223
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,480
Um...

224
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,940
I'm actually halfway through chapter 4.

225
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,380
Eventually, I will get to chapter 30.

226
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,280
I...

227
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,060
I'm almost caught up, guys.

228
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,600
I'm almost there.

229
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,320
Um...

230
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:06,860
Um...

231
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:06,920
Um...

232
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,180
Anyway...

233
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:11,960
So, obviously, because it is a new update, they do have other stuff, like, um...

234
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,480
New...

235
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,600
New event story with...

236
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,140
The Little Mermaid.

237
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,660
And there's also, like, a new minigame called Bubble March.

238
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,580
And, yeah.

239
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,640
So, they recently released chapter 37 and chapter 38.

240
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,520
So, we're eventually there.

241
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,000
Yeah.

242
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,720
By the 30th anniversary, I will catch up by then.

243
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,080
Uh...

244
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,140
Yeah.

245
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,080
I heard the minigame was really fun.

246
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:35,600
Like...

247
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,820
Apparently, you guys can, like, play with me in a way.

248
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:38,700
I'm not sure yet.

249
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,580
Because, obviously, I haven't tried it out.

250
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,440
We're all experiencing it live right now.

251
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,500
But, um...

252
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,400
And, like, I said, like...

253
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,040
I think, like, Nike is also...

254
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,140
Has a really...

255
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,500
Really a good...

256
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,100
Uh...

257
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:52,680
Good story.

258
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,340
Like, with new character...

259
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,580
Character development and story-wise.

260
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:57,580
Um...

261
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,140
People kept telling me that...

262
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,840
The longer you play...

263
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,980
Um...

264
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,600
The longer you play...

265
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,820
The more...

266
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,420
The more sad you'll get.

267
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,660
Because they're...

268
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,740
Because the story is actually really, really good.

269
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,900
So, I hope by the 30th anniversary of Nike...

270
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,920
I will be able to get to chapter 30.

271
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,140
Like, I will get to chapter 30.

272
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:18,980
I...

273
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,220
We will get there.

274
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:24,980
Eventually.

275
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,420
We...

276
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:27,800
Alright.

277
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:28,740
So...

278
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,960
Before we actually...

279
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:31,900
Uh...

280
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,180
Try out the game.

281
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,880
We do have several videos that...

282
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,200
Um...

283
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,600
They sent me to watch.

284
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:38,440
Um...

285
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,380
That's related to the anniversary.

286
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:41,540
Uh...

287
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:41,960
So, yeah.

288
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:42,480
Let me...

289
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,240
Let me get that.

290
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,480
I'll need sound...

291
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,060
Sound guy.

292
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,320
Is sound guy here?

293
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,780
I need to know.

294
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,040
Is sound guy here right now?

295
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,100
Because...

296
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:51,520
Uh...

297
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,100
I don't know if the video is loud enough.

298
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:53,420
Okay.

299
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:53,780
Nice.

300
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,100
Okay.

301
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:54,720
I see you.

302
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,060
I see you, sound guy.

303
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:56,760
Alright.

304
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:57,920
Let's check up...

305
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,120
Let's check up the...

306
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,340
Uh...

307
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,240
Anniversary videos.

308
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,160
And see how...

309
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,420
Let's see what...

310
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,440
It's gonna give us.

311
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,340
There's like three different videos too.

312
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,100
So...

313
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:07,620
Woop.

314
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:08,600
Whoa.

315
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,420
What should we do today?

316
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,960
Oh, is that Little Mermaid?

317
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:21,980
Is that her?

318
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,440
Looking in the mirror together with Cinderella sounds fun.

319
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:29,280
Helping Abe with her bubble research sounds good too.

320
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,080
Oh, that's her.

321
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:34,000
Let's also play on the seesaw with Hansel and Gretel.

322
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,500
Oh my god.

323
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,000
I can't believe she's making Cinderella do stuff for her.

324
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,120
Oh, cause...

325
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:39,880
Oh my god.

326
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,040
Because they're all based off of fairy tales.

327
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,900
I just realized.

328
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,400
That's why she's Little Mermaid.

329
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,660
The Heracle Crew is based off of like fairy tales.

330
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,680
Wait, what?

331
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,640
What happened to them?

332
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,380
What did you do?

333
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,040
Oh.

334
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,940
What do the bubbles mean?

335
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,000
Little Mermaid?

336
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,380
What do they mean?

337
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:12,760
Whoa.

338
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,400
Whoa.

339
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,800
Okay, now I can tell why she's OP.

340
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,300
That's why you don't skip.

341
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,640
I didn't skip!

342
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:32,290
I always play through every story.

343
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:34,490
During the events.

344
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:38,570
Alright, so we're playing this event later on.

345
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,610
What do you mean?

346
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,370
I would never.

347
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:41,270
Oh, okay.

348
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:42,650
See, there's the PV that we...

349
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,450
There's the image.

350
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:43,770
Alright.

351
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:45,390
That's interesting.

352
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:45,890
That's...

353
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:48,250
So that's Little Mermaid that we're definitely gonna get.

354
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,090
Alright, there's...

355
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,330
Now it's off to the storyline preview.

356
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:52,190
Oh, it's the sound guy.

357
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:53,870
I hope the sound's been alright so far.

358
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:57,650
The last piece of paradise on the surface.

359
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,830
Oh, this is a huge chapter.

360
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,030
Whoa!

361
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,250
Turn that down a little.

362
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:13,950
Whoa!

363
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:14,970
Who is she?

364
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,570
What is...

365
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:18,370
Whoa!

366
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:24,210
Guys, this is chapter 37 and chapter 38.

367
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:25,430
Who is she?

368
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:26,730
My new wife.

369
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:31,550
I don't know, but I wanna know.

370
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,670
Mam, do you need a hand?

371
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,010
Maybe two?

372
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,070
What?

373
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,770
Die, traitors!

374
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,050
Oh my god, what the fuck?

375
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,690
It's time to power up!

376
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,470
Oh my god!

377
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:52,950
That's me!

378
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:53,750
Hahaha!

379
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,250
New chapter update.

380
00:16:58,410 --> 00:16:59,510
Well, guys...

381
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:03,430
On the 30th anniversary, I will find out who she is.

382
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:05,050
She might revive right away!

383
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:07,310
Oh my god!

384
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:08,270
What the fuck?

385
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,130
There's more of them?

386
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:11,210
What?

387
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:14,070
I recognize that outfit.

388
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:15,670
It's her.

389
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,290
Oh my god, it's her!

390
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:18,330
There they are!

391
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:19,330
Oh my god!

392
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,850
Oh my god, there's more of them!

393
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,610
Oh my...

394
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,330
Okay, that was interesting.

395
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:27,270
I'll get there on the 30th anniversary.

396
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:28,250
I...

397
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,950
I'll get there.

398
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,350
Oh, alright.

399
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,250
Last video.

400
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,710
Was that Rappi?

401
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,110
Oh, is that one...

402
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:36,890
Which one's Rappi?

403
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:40,150
Oh, the contest to Kee is missing.

404
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:42,770
I got enough context here.

405
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:43,930
Alright.

406
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:46,290
And then, here's the 25th anniversary video.

407
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:49,030
So, there's the new story event.

408
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,130
There's Little Mermaid.

409
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:51,890
Oh, the artist is so beautiful, though.

410
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,270
What is this?

411
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,590
Wait, an island...

412
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,570
Oh, is this the world for her event?

413
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,920
Alright, so there's...

414
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,740
So there's...

415
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,560
There's Little Mermaid.

416
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,320
That's the free character you can get.

417
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,180
There's Mori.

418
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,500
And then, there's Mihara with...

419
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,680
Jesus Christ.

420
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:10,680
There's...

421
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,540
Wait, let me look at what...

422
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,240
Wait, what does Mihara look like now?

423
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,660
Wait, that's Mihara.

424
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:17,460
Wait.

425
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:18,900
Wait.

426
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,500
Wait a minute.

427
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,160
What?

428
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,400
Oh my...

429
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:23,600
Wait.

430
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,140
Stop.

431
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,560
But that's just me.

432
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,180
What the...

433
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,580
Wait.

434
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,000
Wait.

435
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,080
Wait.

436
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,020
That's Mihara?

437
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,960
Wait a minute.

438
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,880
But that's Mihara.

439
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,560
Wait.

440
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,280
Oh my...

441
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,560
Guys, Mihara got...

442
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,560
Got an upgrade.

443
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:50,540
By the way.

444
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,360
Do you guys remember?

445
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,680
But...

446
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,020
That says Mihara.

447
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:55,680
Wait.

448
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:56,240
Okay.

449
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,640
Oh, that's Mondernia.

450
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:58,940
Okay.

451
00:18:59,180 --> 00:18:59,340
Okay.

452
00:18:59,340 --> 00:18:59,620
Okay.

453
00:18:59,820 --> 00:18:59,840
Okay.

454
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,320
We're...

455
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:00,820
Sorry.

456
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:01,820
That's...

457
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,080
That's Mihara.

458
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:03,980
Sorry.

459
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,380
They both start with M.

460
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,060
Okay.

461
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:06,920
I was gonna...

462
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,120
Like...

463
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:08,340
Alright.

464
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:09,620
That's...

465
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:10,760
That's...

466
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,360
Mihara.

467
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:11,880
Okay.

468
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,880
What does she look like now?

469
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:13,340
Sorry.

470
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,020
I need to compare.

471
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:14,940
Oh!

472
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:15,780
Oh!

473
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,180
Alright.

474
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,980
So, if you guys didn't know...

475
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,820
Mihara...

476
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,980
Mihara became an SSR...

477
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,580
Um...

478
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,060
With the anniversary update.

479
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,440
So, this is what she looks like now.

480
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,520
This is what she was before.

481
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,460
So, she got...

482
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,280
She became...

483
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,780
She got an extra S in there.

484
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:37,380
Um...

485
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,220
Oh, whoa.

486
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,080
Yeah.

487
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,520
She got some major upgrades.

488
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,400
Uh...

489
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,140
Alright.

490
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,000
So, there's...

491
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,520
Oh, my gosh.

492
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,480
She has, like, bubble...

493
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:54,940
Oh, my God.

494
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,080
Her entire text...

495
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:56,940
Are bubbles.

496
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,420
Like to be shackled.

497
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,320
Enough business.

498
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,050
You're...

499
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:08,010
But I...

500
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,990
That's just the freaking beauty that you're gonna get.

501
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:10,950
I...

502
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:15,470
I...

503
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:15,630
Hi.

504
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:16,570
Oh.

00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:17,630
Oh.

00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,390
This will go well with my...

507
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:20,690
Okay.

508
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:21,570
Thanks.

509
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,870
Oh, and these are the new outfits you're gonna get.

510
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:24,230
Ooh.

511
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:27,890
Abyss flower.

512
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,390
Oh, is this, like, one new outfit?

513
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:32,050
Is there somewhere darker or quieter we can go?

514
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:34,130
It's too bright here.

515
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,110
A gulp?

516
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,580
I was like, whoa, bubble!

517
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,380
Oh, wow!

518
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:10,400
Okay, um, those are some cool bubbles from that outfit.

Look, I was just talking about the bubbles!

525
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,380
Yes, yes, what color were her eyes, Toki?

526

562
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,340
The little mermaid!

563
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:00,320
Guys!

564
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,580

Cause you can do your polls right now!

566
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,620

00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,040
Woo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

568
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,000
Don't you wanna- Don't you wanna do it?

569
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:14,880

00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:25,220
If you click my link right now, you get up to...

573
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,700
A hundred and, uh...

574
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,160
A hundred and sixty, uh, um...

575
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,460
Up to 160 polls!

576
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,900
So you too can get the little mermaid!

577
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:37,020
And, like, you know, and the others, you know?

578
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:37,660
Ha ha!

579
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,080
Might not be as good as the little mermaid!

580
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,760
But you could also, I guess you could get Mihara!

581
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:43,960
I...

582
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,680
Ha ha ha ha!

583
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:46,920
Ha ha ha!

584
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:47,660
H... I...

585
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,080
I guess you could get her too!

586
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,640
Ha ha ha ha!

587
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,600
Ha ha ha!

588
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,160
Ha ha ha ha ha!

589
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:55,740
Um...

590
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:57,680
Um...

591
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:12,740
Um...

592
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:16,380
I keep forgetting to save the sound profile.

593
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,460
Uh... Oh, it's Mahara's... Sorry.

594
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,720
Mahara is later.

595
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,900
So, like, you know, after you get a little mermaid, maybe...

596
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:26,420
I guess you could save for Mahara later, you know, I guess.

597
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,880
But, like, we're all here for...

598
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,680
We're all here for the little mermaid!

599
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:37,780
Alright.

600
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:38,500
Let's go.

601
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,640
Let me know, sound guy, let me know.

602
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,780
Oh, uh... Oh, we have their... I got a free one, too.

603
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,320
Alright, let's do our free... Wait.

604
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:51,520
No, let's do our free... Wouldn't it be cool if we get our free mermaid right now?

605
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,100
I think we can do it.

606
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:56,080
I think... Wait, actually, before we do, let's claim our rewards.

607
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,780
I will... I like my free stuff real quick.

608
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:58,900
Welcome back.

609
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,120
Let me get my free stuff.

610
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,280
Yay!

611
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:02,620
Free stuff!

612
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:03,480
Yay!

613
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,300
Manual confirmed.

614
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,920
I love free stuff.

615
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,100
Alright, and then... What was the day-by-day?

616
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,320
That's free, too, right?

617
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:11,940
Free!

618
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,020
Free stuff!

619
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:16,960
Alright.

620
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,920
Okay, now that I've done my...

621
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:20,780
Wait.

622
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,160
Did I do all my free stuff?

623
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,260
Did I do all of it?

624
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,000
Free stuff!

625
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,040
Let's go!

626
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:26,900
Free!

627
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:28,460
Alright.

628
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:29,540
Wait, do I have more?

629
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:29,980
Oh, my God.

630
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:30,680
I have more free stuff.

631
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:30,960
Nice.

632
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,940
I know... Okay, let me just claim all.

633
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,720
I'm...

634
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,280
I've decided to do a claim all.

635
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,020
Yippee!

636
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,080
I don't know.

637
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:44,140
I just like the adrenaline of claiming the free stuff one by one.

638
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,140
And then I realized, oh, wait.

639
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,380
I have too many free things.

640
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:47,920
Anyway.

641
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,260
Let's do that.

642
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:49,600
Let's...

643
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,020
You know what?

644
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,160
I think it's possible.

645
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,140
Let's do one on...

646
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,400
Oh, wait.

647
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,020
That's not...

648
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:55,860
That's just a thing.

649
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,440
Alright.

650
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:58,920
It's fine.

651
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,000
It's fine.

652
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:00,440
We...

653
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,580
It had to happen.

654
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,380
Alright.

655
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,480
Having the one plan had to happen.

656
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:04,800
Okay?

657
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:05,740
Like...

658
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,980
It's just...

659
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:07,860
It's just...

660
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,280
Oh, hey!

661
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,060
It's Raffy!

662
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,580
Alright.

663
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,140
Nope.

664
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,360
Get me out of here.

665
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:11,740
Alright.

666
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,320
Now...

667
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,160
Now...

668
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,100
We're gonna get the Little Mermaid right here.

669
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:17,300
Okay.

670
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,120
Before I do the poll, Sound Guy!

671
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,040
Is everything okay, Sound Guy?

672
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,080
Or Chat?

673
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:22,520
Chat!

674
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,760
Is everything sounding great so far?

675
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,040
Um...

676
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,200
Good ol' regular Raffy.

677
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,560
Everything's okay?

678
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,320
Alright.

679
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,400
Yes, it's good.

680
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:33,860
Alright.

681
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:34,520
Let's...

682
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,560
Let's pull...

683
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,260
The Little Mermaid.

684
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:38,580
Okay.

685
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,340
I got nothing.

686
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,200
That's fine.

687
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:40,840
That's fine.

688
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:41,220
You know?

689
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,200
That's...

690
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:42,840
That's okay.

691
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:44,680
I'm...

692
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,960
Sometimes you...

693
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,260
You gotta get through the dust to get...

694
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,380
Wait, what's she?

695
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,180
Do I have her?

696
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,960
Wait, I don't have her.

697
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,060
She's new, right?

698
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:54,860
Nice to meet you.

699
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,160
Okay, and then I don't care about them.

700
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:57,940
Soldier F.A.

701
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,540
Okay, that...

702
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:58,840
She's new.

703
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,740
Okay, I got like a million Tetris.

704
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:01,460
Soldier F .A.

705
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,460
It's fine.

706
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,420
It's fine.

707
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:05,760
Don't you know?

708
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,780
There's a fine line between pleasure and pain.

709
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:13,680
I'm Nia.

710
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,860
Nice to meet you.

711
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,620
Alright, let's do that again.

712
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,240
Alright, let's...

713
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:25,960
Alright, let's do it again.

714
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,100
I'm okay.

715
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,200
We're here for the Little Mermaid.

716
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,160
I'm okay.

717
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:34,080
Woo!

718
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,040
I'm good.

719
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,260
I'm good, guys.

720
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,840
Wait, is that her?

721
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,580
Wait, is that her?

722
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:44,900
Get out.

723
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:46,880
Get out.

724
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,380
Please.

725
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:49,460
Okay, wait.

726
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:51,680
Did I get her?

727
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,600
Did I get her?

728
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:55,560
No!

729
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,360
Who the fuck are you?

730
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,740
Who even are you?

731
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:06,020
You're not in my anniversary event.

732
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:10,860
But...

733
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,600
But she's...

734
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,100
Dude, she was not...

735
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,320
She's not in the PV.

736
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,580
She does not matter.

737
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,120
Nice to meet you.

738
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,340
I have enough SSR.

739
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,840
I need the busted meta characters.

740
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,200
Yes, but...

741
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,920
But is she meta, guys?

742
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,580
That's the most important part.

743
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:28,760
Is she meta?

744
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:33,300
There's a fine line between pleasure...

745
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:33,660
She's...

746
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:34,480
Please.

747
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,440
Please.

748
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,880
Get out.

749
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,520
I'm trying to resist temptation.

750
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,960
I'm trying to resist.

751
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,200
I'm...

752
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,960
Not one bit.

753
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:48,620
All right.

754
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,180
She's hot.

755
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,300
She's meta in my heart.

756
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,640
Come on.

757
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,620
That's gold eyes.

758
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,380
Wait, that's two.

759
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:01,540
Okay.

760
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,360
Okay, this is it.

761
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:02,800
This is it.

762
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:03,340
This is it.

763
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,280
We got two golds.

764
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,540
The odds are...

765
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,140
We got double.

766
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:06,900
We got doubles.

767
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:07,940
The odds are in our favor.

768
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:10,480
Okay.

769
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:11,640
Okay, get out.

770
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:14,340
I don't care about you, Tetra, and Ellison.

771
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,340
Who's here?

772
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,940
TLC for the sick.

773
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,760
Painful shots for the malingerers.

774
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,860
Oh my god.

775
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,140
Easter's over.

776
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,140
Easter's over.

777
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,260
Get out.

778
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,840
It's the little mermaid's time to shine.

779
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,100
All right, it's fine.

780
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,040
I still have no chance.

781
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,040
Come on.

782
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:45,580
Come on.

783
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:46,740
Is that her?

784
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,600
Is that you?

785
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,660
It is so adorable.

786
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,480
I'll get rid of anything standing in your way.

787
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:55,680
Anything.

788
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,880
Whoa, she'll do anything.

789
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,600
Oh, is she the worst pilgrim?

790
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,140
Oh.

791
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,760
That's why she'll do anything.

792
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,780
The worst?

793
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:09,840
What?

794
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,120
Oh, Jesus.

795
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:13,840
Oh my god.

796
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,020
She sounds incredibly...

797
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,420
Okay, guys, look.

798
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:23,980
Of all the pilgrims you can get, she is the worst.

799
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:24,880
Guys, stop.

800
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,560
My luck is not that bad.

801
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,980
Guys, it's gonna turn around right now.

802
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,420
This is it.

803
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,580
I get all the bad things now.

804
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,560
So now, I'll get the little mermaid.

805
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,880
How do you lose the 50?

806
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,240
Guys, it's okay.

807
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:42,920
This...

808
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,120
Okay.

809
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,320
I get all the bad stuff now.

810
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:50,560
So now, I should get the good stuff.

811
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,860
Right here.

812
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:53,960
That's fine.

813
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:54,720
That's fine.

814
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:57,920
I might have got a million fucking purple hair, girl.

815
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:58,640
But it's okay.

816
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,260
This is it.

817
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,400
This is it.

818
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:02,980
This is it.

819
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,000
How would I lose my 50-50?

820
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:06,820
How?

821
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,380
Right here.

822
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,760
Right now.

823
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:10,920
My luck changes.

824
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,840
Where are the gold eyes?

825
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,420
Where are the gold eyes?

826
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,380
Are you serious?

827
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,940
Are you...

828
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:17,760
Get it.

829
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,140
Stop stalking me.

830
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,820
Stop stalking me.

831
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,400
Stop stalking me.

832
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:25,600
Please.

833
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,420
Please, let me have my life.

834
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,820
Get out of my head.

835
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,740
Get out of my head.

836
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:32,920
Get...

837
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,200
How much do I have?

838
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,280
Okay, there's still...

839
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,160
I have two more pulls.

840
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,160
I have...

841
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:37,600
It's fine.

842
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,220
This is it.

843
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,120
This time.

844
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,200
This time.

845
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,300
Get out of my head.

846
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:46,440
Hurry up.

847
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:48,900
Gold eyes.

848
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:49,520
Gold eyes.

849
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,160
Gold eyes.

850
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:50,720
Gold eyes.

851
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:51,140
Come on.

852
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,300
Give me the gold eyes.

853
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:53,820
Are you...

854
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,160
Oh my god!

855
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,620
Okay, it's okay.

856
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,060
I still have other... I still have the one pause, guys.

857
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:04,540
That's fine.

858
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,320
We still last... Okay, this is... This is fine.

859
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:07,920
This is fine.

860
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:08,400
This is fine.

861
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:08,880
This is it.

862
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,660
This is... We... We... Blunked the other pause.

863
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:17,940
And... So that... So that... It's all part of, like, the streaming plan, you know?

864
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,560
Like, we build up the tension.

865
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,800
We build up the tension and then, like...

866
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,400
This time... We build up the tension.

867
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:31,520
And on the final pull... That's when, like... And then you get... And then we get it.

868
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,520
And then it becomes a clippable moment.

869
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:34,400
And...

870
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,620
This is part of my streamer plan.

871
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:40,800
This is it.

872
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,380
Right here.

873
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,100
And then it's gonna give me golden eyes.

874
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:44,440
Right?

875
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,540
The eyes are gonna be gold.

876
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,300
Right, guys?

877
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,680
The... The eyes... Yellow eyes!

878
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,400
Wait... Oh... Oh!

879
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,760
It's okay.

880
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,180
It's okay.

881
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:54,820
It's okay.

882
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,100
It's part of the streamer plan.

883
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,360
Where... Um... I'm gonna get it on the single pulls.

884
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,220
That's where it's gonna happen.

885
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,300
So, like, I build up so much tension and hype.

886
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:09,720
That, like, I have at least five single pulls.

887
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,220
Where I'm gonna get it.

888
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,160
I...

889
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,360
Right here.

890
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,480
Right now.

891
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:21,460
Also, Namas, thank you for gifting a sub to desperate play.

892
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:21,940
No, no, no.

893
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:25,840
This is where all the real tension boils up to.

894
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,680
We're gonna get the single pulls.

895
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:31,000
And then... And then she's gonna show up there.

896
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,040
There.

897
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:37,760
That's where the... That's where all the real hype is.

898
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:42,100
And then... And then it's gonna become a clippable moment.

899
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,100
Wait.

900
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:43,840
Wait.

901
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:47,120
Did it... Did it, like, go extras?

902
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:47,660
Oh, no.

903
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,500
It's just a regular.

904
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,180
It's okay.

905
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,700
We still have the single pulls.

906
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,360
Right here.

907
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,380
Oh, wait.

908
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,540
It's... It turned blue.

909
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:59,380
Is that good?

910
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,440
Is blue a good color?

911
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,260
It's okay.

912
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,620
We still have more.

913
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,300
It's gonna be the very last one.

914
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,680
Oh, my God.

915
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,340
Please.

916
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,360
No.

917
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:13,540
Please.

918
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,160
Oh, they can't do this to me.

919
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:18,620
No.

920
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:22,400
They can't... Oh, my God.

921
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,020
Thank you.

922
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,020
Can you...

923
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,380
Do I have enough free stuff?

924
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,960
Let me... Give me a sec.

925
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,580
Guys, what gives me free pulls?

926
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,100
Guys.

927
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:48,300
Do I have anything in here that can... None of... Do I...

928
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,160
The credit card?

929
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,780
I don't understand.

930
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,420
What happened to me?

931
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,420
What... What happened?

932
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:06,340
I used to be the luckiest bird of all time when I came to...

933
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:09,460
I couldn't get any character I've ever wanted.

934
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,460
What happened?

935
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,140
What happened to me?

936
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,700
I... I don't understand.

937
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,920
I... I don't...

938
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,860
I don't... What happened?

939
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,240
I...

940
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,540
Oh, my luck.

941
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,020
It's okay.

942
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,160
I have...

943
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,200
I have you.

944
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:31,600
I...

945
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,720
I don't really want to get...

946
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,380
I have you.

947
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,880
I like to have my commander.

948
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,300
I like to have my commander.

949
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,280
I have you.

950
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,320
It's okay.

951
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:47,920
Oh.

952
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,380
It feels good.

953
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,500
It's so...

954
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,200
I don't...

955
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,520
It's okay.

956
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,940
I have another one.

957
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,520
Well, I can enjoy the battle a bit more.

958
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,860
Now, you're big and strong.

959
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,860
It's alright.

960
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,020
Get out of here, crow.

961
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,060
I'm always ready.

962
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,040
Alright.

963
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,480
It's okay.

964
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,300
I have her.

965
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,260
That's...

966
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,220
Do I?

967
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,800
There's pity?

968
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,760
Do I?

969
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,640
Do I have enough pity, guys?

970
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,080
Wait.

971
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:33,680
Wait.

972
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,020
Okay.

973
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:34,860
Okay.

974
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,060
Oh, my God.

975
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:37,380
Wait.

976
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,240
Oh, my God.

977
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:38,420
Wait.

978
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,060
I have one more.

979
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,080
I have...

980
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:40,660
Guys.

981
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,100
I have one more.

982
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,380
It's not...

983
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:43,840
Guys.

984
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:44,880
Guys.

985
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,920
It's not over.

986
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:46,860
Guys.

987
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:49,440
I have one more, Paul.

988
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,580
It's not over.

989
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,880
It's not...

990
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,620
We have one more.

991
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:55,720
This is it.

992
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,220
This is it.

993
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:56,940
Right here.

994
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,780
It was a blue.

995
00:36:59,060 --> 00:36:59,580
It was...

996
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:02,880
This is the one last chance.

997
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,740
It was a blue.

998
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,940
Manny, thank you for the thousand pitties.

999
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,940
Thank you, thank you.

1000
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,380
It's okay, guys, guys.

1001
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,200
No, no, no, no.

1002
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,380
Guys, guys, wait.

1003
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,440
Wait, there's still... It's okay.

1004
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:27,440
That piece I can level up for more.

1005
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,760
I like to have...

1006
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,680
It's okay, guys.

1007
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:35,560
At least I got to level her up a little more.

1008
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:43,570
Wait, go ahead to event to claim two more?

1009
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,710
Oh my god, it's not over.

1010
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:47,710
Wait, what do I do?

1011
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:50,310
Is this?

1012
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:52,330
No, that just gives me that.

1013
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:54,830
How do I...

1014
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:56,990
How do I claim another?

1015
00:37:57,490 --> 00:37:59,130
Go to the event tab.

1016
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:00,090
Okay, I did it.

1017
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:01,630
What do I do?

1018
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:04,470
What do I do?

1019
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:06,350
Look, this one?

1020
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:08,310
Oh!

1021
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:09,570
Oh my god, free gotcha.

1022
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:12,030
Oh my, it's not... Guys, it's not over.

1023
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:13,930
Guys, it's not over, guys.

1024
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:16,730
There's still hope, but it's not over.

1025
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:18,710
Come and make a fortune.

1026
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:20,310
Oh, it's okay.

1027
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:21,270
It's free anyway.

1028
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:22,530
Okay, that wasn't it.

1029
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:23,170
Alright.

1030
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,690
Okay, is this the event?

1031
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:26,670
Okay, we'll do that.

1032
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:27,230
Oh, wait.

1033
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:28,730
Wait, there's so much more.

1034
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:29,850
Wait a minute.

1035
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,310
There's so much more.

1036
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:32,890
There's the anniversary pass.

1037
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:34,730
Oh my god, claim off.

1038
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:36,750
Okay, none of those work.

1039
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:40,710
Wait, did I do everything?

1040
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:41,710
Mission.

1041
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:42,870
Claim off.

1042
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:44,850
Okay, I don't know what I got.

1043
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:45,230
Alright.

1044
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:46,430
What did I get?

1045
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:48,550
Alright.

1046
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:50,590
Vault claim.

1047
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:53,810
Confirmed.

1048
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:57,750
That's not enough.

1049
00:38:57,890 --> 00:38:58,690
That's only two.

1050
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:00,250
That's only two.

1051
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:01,210
That's not enough.

1052
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:02,070
Okay.

1053
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:03,150
That's five.

1054
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:07,170
I get a free Mori, too.

1055
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:07,970
That's five.

1056
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,070
Alright, that's cool.

1057
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,070
Maybe if you need me to do anything.

1058
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:15,510
I guess.

1059
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:16,310
That's cool.

1060
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:17,130
I don't care about you.

1061
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:18,410
You can get her for free, by the way.

1062
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:19,530
That's how you get her for free.

1063
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:21,070
Thank you for the...

1064
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:22,710
Oh my god.

1065
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:23,690
She gave me free temples.

1066
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:24,950
Never mind.

1067
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:26,130
Oh my god.

1068
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:26,670
Never mind.

1069
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:27,870
Remember what I said about you?

1070
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:28,370
It's okay.

1071
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:29,530
I didn't mean that.

1072
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:31,170
You gave me the one thing I wanted.

1073
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:32,310
Alright, it's time.

1074
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:32,870
This is it.

1075
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:33,430
This is it.

1076
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:33,890
Right here.

1077
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:34,550
Right now.

1078
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:35,230
This is it.

1079
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:36,470
Oh my god.

1080
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:37,570
I love Mori now.

1081
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:38,750
Oh my god.

1082
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:38,790
I love Mori now.

1083
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:40,050
Oh my

1084
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:46,450
god.

1085
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:15,500
I love Mori now.

1086
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:15,940
I got...

1087
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:18,480
There must be more than I can claim.

1088
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:19,800
Surely.

1089
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,280
Okay.

1090
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,100
I'm level two.

1091
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,920
Is there any more that I can claim?

1092
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,200
Surely there's more, right?

1093
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,300
Surely.

1094
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:28,300
No, no.

1095
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,080
I'm not done.

1096
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,080
It's not over yet.

1097
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,960
There's surely more.

1098
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:34,500
Okay.

1099
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:35,560
Confirmed.

1100
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:36,400
Alright.

1101
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:37,980
What else?

1102
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:39,740
Okay.

1103
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:40,400
I get hearts.

1104
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,060
Alright.

1105
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:42,840
Four points.

1106
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:43,720
Is there anything else?

1107
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:46,260
Is there anything else I can claim?

1108
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,140
Surely there's one more thing I can claim.

1109
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:49,460
Right?

1110
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,880
Is there...

1111
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,600
Surely there's more.

1112
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:00,070
What?

1113
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,210
Is there nothing more?

1114
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:05,150
Is there nothing more I can claim?

1115
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:08,630
Oh my god.

1116
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:09,570
The CD keys.

1117
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:10,830
How do I do that?

1118
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:13,610
How do I do the CD keys, guys?

1119
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:14,870
No, no, no.

1120
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:17,410
Where?

1121
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:20,710
It's not over!

1122
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:22,430
There's still...

1123
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:22,650
Oh!

1124
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:24,450
Resupply quest.

1125
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:25,010
Okay.

1126
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:28,450
It's never over until...

1127
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:29,890
Until I say it's over.

1128
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:32,270
Okay.

1129
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:37,030
Wait.

1130
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:38,370
Do I use it?

1131
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,500
Do I do it?

1132
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:44,860
Oh no.

1133
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:45,280
Okay.

1134
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,040
I didn't do it.

1135
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:47,900
There's no more.

1136
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,920
I clicked all the red dots.

1137
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,700
But this is the story.

1138
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,220
We don't play story yet.

1139
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:54,680
Guys.

1140
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:56,580
Initiating operation...

1141
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:56,840
No!

1142
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,000
Why did you do...

1143
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,580
Alright.

1144
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,900
I guess we play a little bit.

1145
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,860
We go through the story a little bit.

1146
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:08,920
The objective is to eradicate all of the E2 crystals in the crystal region.

1147
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:13,780
And complete the groundwork for the future expansion of reclamation site 01.

1148
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,480
We'll get there eventually, little bro.

1149
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,480
In form.

1150
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:18,560
Thank you for the 1550s.

1151
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:20,520
Thank you.

1152
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:21,240
Thank you.

1153
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,420
Thank you.

1154
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,500
In form.

1155
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:26,300
Thank you for gifting us subs to coping.

1156
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,980
It's not over, guys.

1157
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:31,100
It's not over.

1158
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:34,380
There are no squads that have been officially deployed to the crystal region.

1159
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:39,280
Of course, we can't discount the fact that there might be squads who came out of...

1160
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,000
I don't understand.

1161
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,180
I was the luckiest bird.

1162
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,460
And gotcha.

1163
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:49,780
I would get characters within two or three pulls.

1164
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:52,160
What happened to me?

1165
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,100
No need case should be caught up in any trouble.

1166
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:55,100
You guys...

1167
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,500
You took all my luck.

1168
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:57,900
You took...

1169
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:02,840
You absorbed all my luck!

1170
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,320
Confirming landing coordinates.

1171
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:07,200
Firing AA pillar towards...

1172
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:07,920
You!

1173
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,060
You!

1174
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:11,420
Launch complete.

1175
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:14,820
Transferring control to the operator until landing.

1176
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,540
Sorry, Toki.

1177
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,120
I got her hit 20 pulls.

1178
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:21,840
That's right!

1179
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:23,440
All set.

1180
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:24,900
Landing now.

1181
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,320
Thanks for the luck, Toki.

1182
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:28,800
Landing in...

1183
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,500
Three minutes?

1184
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:34,620
Descends much slower than the A pillar.

1185
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,120
Maybe because it's so much larger.

1186
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:42,040
The energy contained within it is significantly greater than that of the A pillar.

1187
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:45,740
Well...

1188
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:47,500
But this appears to be an urgent call.

1189
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,100
It's okay.

1190
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:54,960
You guys want up to 160 pulls and absorb more of my luck!

1191
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:55,600
You captured a rare specimen?

1192
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,160
Exclamation point, Nikke.

1193
00:43:58,620 --> 00:43:58,840
Where are you right now?

1194
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,480
I'm sorry.

1195
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,820
Get away from there immediately.

1196
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,540
I have nothing more to lose.

1197
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:09,700
Huh?

1198
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:11,580
Mana?

1199
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:15,080
I'm picking up a strange signal near the AA pillar.

1200
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:16,500
What?

1201
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:21,780
What?

1202
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:22,280
Oh my god!

1203
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,360
What the fuck?

1204
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,680
Colossal entity of some kind burst...

1205
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:26,820
What?

1206
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:27,740
Why does it have...

1207
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:28,600
Teeth?

1208
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,620
It has like double sets of teeth like fish.

1209
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:32,420
Whoa!

1210
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:33,000
Ugh!

1211
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:35,180
That sound effect was disgusting.

1212
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,620
What the mouth do?

1213
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:42,760
That's...

1214
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:43,760
That's...

1215
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:47,310
Higher AA pillar!

1216
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:47,710
That's...

1217
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:49,790
Wait, it swallowed the entire pillar?

1218
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:51,230
This is emergency!

1219
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:52,010
How hungry!

1220
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:53,030
Ha ha ha ha!

1221
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:53,970
Tell them...

1222
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:54,730
Code name...

1223
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:56,070
Gluttony has appeared!

1224
00:44:56,350 --> 00:44:57,430
Wait, that's gluttony?

1225
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:00,490
That's a sin!

1226
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:04,730
I hear the sound of something falling in the water.

1227
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:08,730
And my body begins to sink underneath the surface.

1228
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:11,130
I think I'm drowning.

1229
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:12,790
Who's that?

1230
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:13,850
Is that mermaid?

1231
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:16,490
How long can Anike breathe underwater again?

1232
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:19,650
How long can my body last?

1233
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:21,470
It's not over, Xerantor.

1234
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:23,010
It's not over.

1235
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:24,410
Who will come to save me?

1236
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:24,530
Who will come to save me?

1237
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:25,410
There's still time!

1238
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:27,270
I could get more pulls!

1239
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:27,750
If I noticed without you...

1240
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:29,390
I wouldn't have accepted that offer.

1241
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:32,250
It's not over until the stream ends!

1242
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:35,170
I didn't want to die.

1243
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:38,690
I don't...

1244
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:40,670
I don't wanna die.

1245
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:42,750
Die!

1246
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:44,770
Someone...

1247
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:50,220
You won't die!

1248
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,500
Oh, that's mermaid!

1249
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:52,960
Someone grabs my hand...

1250
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:53,720
You won't die!

1251
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,600
Yeah!

1252
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:15,560
Oh, there's Mori!

1253
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:16,700
There's my free character!

1254
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,380
Wait, she's breathing underwater!

1255
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:28,570
Wait...

1256
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:29,710
Well, there's an underground...

1257
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:30,450
Underwater tree!

1258
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:32,570
Am I really dead?

1259
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:35,530
Oh, there she is!

1260
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:36,930
Bitch!

1261
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:39,510
There's that bitch!

1262
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:41,410
Is that a fairy?

1263
00:46:41,410 --> 00:46:44,430
Hmm- Ha ha ha!

1264
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:44,630
Oh!

1265
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:46,810
U- Whoa!

1266
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:48,010
Tokey!

1267
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:49,950
Hah ha ha ha ha!

1268
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:53,430
Unbreakable spear...

1269
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:54,530
Hah ha ha ha!

1270
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:57,870
You will never get her now!

1271
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:00,070
I swear, I'll get her!

1272
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:02,470
I'll fucking get her!

1273
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:05,130
Give me, give me the voucher!

1274
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:05,150
Healing away!

1275
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:05,310
give me...

1276
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:06,810
Give me the voucher!

1277
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:12,330
Alright, let's see.

1278
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:13,110
What's the challenge?

1279
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:17,790
Okay, go to... Is there anything here?

1280
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:19,530
What's this?

1281
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:22,890
Oh, challenge mode.

1282
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:24,650
Oh, it gives me like another voucher.

1283
00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:25,610
Alright, get out.

1284
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:26,050
Okay.

1285
00:47:26,770 --> 00:47:27,850
Alright, here we go.

1286
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:30,470
No, don't say that.

1287
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:31,970
Don't say that.

1288
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:34,150
I don't... It won't happen.

1289
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:35,050
Alright, here we go.

1290
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:36,010
Here we go.

1291
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:36,610
This is it.

1292
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:38,290
This is it.

1293
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:40,750
We got this.

1294
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:44,410
Okay, not this one.

1295
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:45,850
We got the next one.

1296
00:47:49,850 --> 00:47:51,090
Okay, that's not it.

1297
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:53,870
Wait, someone said you could get free gems in the shop.

1298
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:55,250
Oh my god, really?

1299
00:47:56,390 --> 00:47:57,330
That's a thing?

1300
00:47:57,570 --> 00:47:58,790
Alright, let's see.

1301
00:47:59,130 --> 00:47:59,550
Shop.

1302
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:02,090
I will do everything you need.

1303
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:06,390
Okay, um... That's zero dollars.

1304
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:07,910
Where's the free stuff?

1305
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:11,730
I thought... Oh, it's in the cash shop?

1306
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:13,690
Okay, cash shop.

1307
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:16,910
Where's my free stuff?

1308
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:19,870
Oh, there it is.

1309
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:22,790
Oh my god, there's free stuff.

1310
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:23,210
There it is.

1311
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:23,470
Okay.

1312
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:25,790
Okay, we got one of our free stuff.

1313
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:26,130
Okay.

1314
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:30,370
Is there any more free stuff?

1315
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:35,390
Is there... Oh, this isn't free.

1316
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:36,810
Oh, there's more.

1317
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:38,050
There's 10.

1318
00:48:38,370 --> 00:48:38,630
10.

1319
00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:41,010
And then there's 50.

1320
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:43,010
And then there's 100.

1321
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:44,770
Okay, we have another free pull, guys.

1322
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:47,070
We have... That's fine.

1323
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:48,570
Guys, we have another...

1324
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:49,450
Oh my god.

1325
00:48:49,590 --> 00:48:51,110
And we got another 50 here.

1326
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:53,170
Okay, this is... This is possible.

1327
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:53,950
Alright.

1328
00:48:54,610 --> 00:48:55,470
Alright, now...

1329
00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:00,470
Now, we have... We got one more pull.

1330
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:04,890
I'm like... I'm like looking through the couches for loose change.

1331
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:05,910
This is it.

1332
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:06,630
Right here.

1333
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:07,890
Right now.

1334
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:08,790
This is it.

1335
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:10,310
Right here.

1336
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:12,210
Oh my god.

1337
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:14,390
I fucking...

1338
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:18,590
Why is it purple?

1339
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:21,070
Why is it purple?

1340
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:22,170
Okay.

1341
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:22,990
Alright.

1342
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:24,790
We have more loose change, guys.

1343
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:25,750
Alright, here we go.

1344
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:28,190
Where... What... What do we click for it?

1345
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:30,010
Which one's the...

1346
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:31,210
Okay.

1347
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:33,130
Now we have CD keys.

1348
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:36,650
This is fine.

1349
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:39,830
Wait, there's more stuff.

1350
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:42,270
Wait, that's not it.

1351
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:44,510
What do we do?

1352
00:49:45,830 --> 00:49:47,790
Let's scroll down the CD key.

1353
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:48,630
Okay, here we go.

1354
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:50,970
Alright.

1355
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:52,230
Alright.

1356
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:53,850
What's the CD key, guys?

1357
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:55,850
Guys, what is it?

1358
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:57,430
Let me hide this real quick.

1359
00:49:57,670 --> 00:49:58,810
Guys, what's the CD key?

1360
00:49:58,810 --> 00:49:59,310
Okay.

1361
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:00,070
Codes...

1362
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:00,850
Codes to enter.

1363
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:03,350
This is it.

1364
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:04,430
Right here.

1365
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:05,530
Alright.

1366
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:06,090
Redeemed.

1367
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:06,950
Alright.

1368
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:07,990
I don't know what I got.

1369
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:10,190
But I'm using all these CD keys.

1370
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:11,810
Something will happen.

1371
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:13,130
I believe.

1372
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:17,050
You guys just don't...

1373
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:19,230
You guys just need to start believing more, chat.

1374
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:21,250
It's cause...

1375
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:21,870
None of you...

1376
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:23,250
You guys all stopped believing.

1377
00:50:24,110 --> 00:50:24,790
Alright, here we go.

1378
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:26,970
Alright, I got all of it.

1379
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:29,590
Alright.

1380
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:32,010
Okay, how much did I get?

1381
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:35,590
Wait, how much did I get from that?

1382
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:38,070
Did I get it?

1383
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:41,330
Oh my god.

1384
00:50:41,490 --> 00:50:42,550
I'm rich.

1385
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:43,830
Guys, look.

1386
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:46,230
Guys, look, I'm rich.

1387
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:47,970
Oh my god.

1388
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:50,550
That's enough for two more pulls.

1389
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:51,890
Oh my god.

1390
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:52,750
I'm so rich.

1391
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:56,610
That's enough.

1392
00:50:57,850 --> 00:50:58,750
That's enough.

1393
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:00,030
That's two more pulls.

1394
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:00,590
Right here.

1395
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:02,930
Oh my god.

1396
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:03,290
Please.

1397
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:04,510
Come on.

1398
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:09,290
Please.

1399
00:51:09,790 --> 00:51:10,210
How did I...

1400
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:11,210
That's enough for one more.

1401
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:12,410
I have one more.

1402
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:13,110
This is it.

1403
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:13,550
Right here.

1404
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:15,490
Oh.

1405
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:20,070
Nice to meet you.

1406
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:28,090
Okay, but what if...

1407
00:51:28,090 --> 00:51:28,850
I just...

1408
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:31,370
I purchased 3,000 gems.

1409
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:32,150
Wait, I have clothes?

1410
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:34,190
What do you mean clothes?

1411
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:35,930
How do I use my clothes?

1412
00:51:37,150 --> 00:51:38,190
I can pity her?

1413
00:51:38,610 --> 00:51:39,550
Oh my god.

1414
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:40,510
Is it possible?

1415
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:45,350
Wait, what's this?

1416
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:49,190
Wait, do I have pity?

1417
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:50,270
I...

1418
00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:50,710
No.

1419
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:27,990
I did it.

1420
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:30,450
I will never fall.

1421
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,070
Never falter.

1422
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:35,850
For I must keep the promise I made to everyone.

1423
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:37,750
I did it.

1424
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:48,700
Yippee!

1425
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,100
You're so...

1426
00:52:57,620 --> 00:52:58,820
What is she?

1427
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:03,220
You're so beautiful.

1428
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:09,340
If Abe could see me now, I'm sure she...

1429
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:10,000
What should I...

1430
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,900
I should keep talking.

1431
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:12,760
I should keep talking.

1432
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:13,340
Or else I...

1433
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:14,900
might forget how to speak.

1434
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:19,380
Alright!

1435
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:21,020
I did it.

1436
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:22,120
I can't speak normally.

1437
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:24,620
You're beautiful.

1438
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:28,880
I shall make you wear clothes.

1439
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:31,500
To cover you up.

1440
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:41,500
What?

1441
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:46,310
Alright.

1442
00:53:47,470 --> 00:53:50,870
At best, you might as well be strong for me.

1443
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:51,690
Why?

1444
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:54,250
Let them free.

1445
00:53:56,990 --> 00:54:00,810
You might as well be big and strong for me.

1446
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:08,690
I did it.

1447
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:09,410
I did it.

1448
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:10,570
Yippee!

1449
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:13,790
Wait, what's her new costume?

1450
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:14,590
Wait, is this the...

1451
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:15,210
Oh my god!

1452
00:54:15,370 --> 00:54:16,690
She's just in a bubble?

1453
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:19,190
Wait, how does she attack...

1454
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:19,650
Oh wait, no.

1455
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:20,170
It just...

1456
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:20,470
Okay.

1457
00:54:21,290 --> 00:54:22,510
Oh my god!

1458
00:54:22,970 --> 00:54:25,430
Wait, she just shoved bubble out of her hands!

1459
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:29,510
Her ammo is her hands!

1460
00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:31,710
That's cool.

1461
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:34,990
Okay, wait, what does she look like here?

1462
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:35,590
Okay.

1463
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:39,870
Oh my god, her bubbles!

1464
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:44,470
She has like bubble hands.

1465
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:46,370
What is this like...

1466
00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:47,910
Oh, I was gonna say, does she actually walk?

1467
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:48,510
Hahaha!

1468
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:49,710
Does she...

1469
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:52,310
Does she actually know how to walk?

1470
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:53,190
Or does she just...

1471
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:55,650
Or does she just like use...

1472
00:54:55,650 --> 00:54:56,570
Use the bubbles?

1473
00:54:57,730 --> 00:54:58,270
Alright.

1474
00:54:58,910 --> 00:54:59,510
I'm...

1475
00:54:59,510 --> 00:55:01,310
I'm so happy for me.

1476
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:03,570
I'm so...

1477
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:04,190
Happy.

1478
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:06,670
Guys, look!

1479
00:55:06,730 --> 00:55:07,450
I pulled her!

1480
00:55:07,870 --> 00:55:08,790
Guys, look!

1481
00:55:09,770 --> 00:55:11,350
Guys, I told you!

1482
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:15,350
Guys, I told you I can pull me hard!

1483
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:16,410
Not me, sorry.

1484
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:18,390
Sorry, she's still in my mind.

1485
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:22,530
I told you we can pull the little mermaid, guys!

1486
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:25,350
You just gotta believe!

1487
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:27,150
Look at that!

1488
00:55:27,310 --> 00:55:28,590

1489
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:31,430
Or else I might forget how to speak!

1490
00:55:32,210 --> 00:55:33,470
See, guys!

1491
00:55:33,550 --> 00:55:34,810
We did it!

1492
00:55:35,510 --> 00:55:36,190
We...

1493
00:55:36,190 --> 00:55:41,150
And I did it without using my credit card for more money!

1494
00:55:42,190 --> 00:55:42,750
Alright!

1495
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:45,790
We did it!

1496
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:46,330
Yay!

1497
00:55:49,090 --> 00:55:50,470
I'm so happy...

1498
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:51,690
I'm so happy for me!

1499
00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:52,610
I...

1500
00:55:57,690 --> 00:55:59,190
Oh my god!

1501
00:55:59,390 --> 00:55:59,990
Get out of here!

1502
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:00,530
Where's me?

1503
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:01,710
Where is she?

1504
00:56:02,090 --> 00:56:03,170
Where is she?

1505
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:04,970
I need her on here!

1506
00:56:05,350 --> 00:56:08,910
Guys, how do I change the characters in this area?

1507
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:10,430
I keep forgetting how to do it!

1508
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:12,330
How do I change the characters?

1509
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:13,230
Top right?

1510
00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:15,550
We're in top right!

1511
00:56:16,670 --> 00:56:17,730
Top right corner?

1512
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:18,670
Top right?

1513
00:56:18,890 --> 00:56:19,950
And then what do I do?

1514
00:56:20,050 --> 00:56:20,470
Lobby?

1515
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:22,590
Alright!

1516
00:56:23,090 --> 00:56:24,310
Get out of here!

1517
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:26,330
Get out of here!

1518
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:27,430
I don't need you!

1519
00:56:28,070 --> 00:56:29,530
Wait, how do I turn you off?

1520
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:30,490
Here?

1521
00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:33,470
Oh wait!

1522
00:56:33,630 --> 00:56:34,090
It's like this!

1523
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:34,350
Okay!

1524
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:36,030
And then...

1525
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:36,350
Her!

1526
00:56:38,030 --> 00:56:38,510
And...

1527
00:56:38,510 --> 00:56:39,910
Who else do I want in here?

1528
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:42,390
I want...

1529
00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:43,690
Can I have two...

1530
00:56:43,690 --> 00:56:44,550
Wait, can I have two...

1531
00:56:44,550 --> 00:56:45,870
Oh, I could have...

1532
00:56:49,470 --> 00:56:49,950
Um...

1533
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:51,770
Where's the other one?

1534
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:52,910
Where is she?

1535
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:54,290
There we go!

1536
00:56:55,170 --> 00:56:56,290
I'll move it here!

1537
00:56:57,090 --> 00:56:57,990
Alright, nice!

1538
00:56:58,430 --> 00:56:58,870
Alright!

1539
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:09,620
Oh, when she goes to...

1540
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:10,560
Ah, point!

1541
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,260
Oh, she forgot to speak!

1542
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:14,740
It's been so long!

1543
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:15,980
To me!

1544
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:19,600
Alright, guys!

1545
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:20,700
So...

1546
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:21,160
Guys!

1547
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,400
By the way, it's not just gacha, guys!

1548
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,200
We also...

1549
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,200
I guess...

1550
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:25,680
Look at that!

1551
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:26,420
I told you!

1552
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:27,980
You guys were like...

1553
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:29,920
You guys were like...

1554
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,180
She'll never get...

1555
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:32,000
Get...

1556
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:35,220
She'll never get the little mermaid!

1557
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:36,940
I proved you wrong!

1558
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:41,540
I told you I can get her!

1559
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:43,160
Any means possible!

1560
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:45,480
Alright, let's do the story!

1561
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:46,640
So...

1562
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:51,060
Apparently, she's been stuck in gluttony stomach for a while now!

1563
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:52,180
And...

1564
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:56,100
We can try a little bit of the story before we do bubbles!

1565
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:56,920
Hey, guys!

1566
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,720
If you guys want to try your hand!

1567
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:02,160
I'm trying to get the little mermaid and do it first try like I did!

1568
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:03,260
Uh...

1569
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:05,860
You know...

1570
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,520
You can also...

1571
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,100
You can sign up right now!

1572
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:12,160

Up to 160 free pulls!

And you too!

1582
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:28,180
Can get the little mermaid in one pull!

1583
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:29,680
Just like me!

1584
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:34,280
How many chapters do I have to do to do the minigame chat?

1585
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:36,580
Axis denied?

1586
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:38,460
Alright!

1587
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:39,960
How do we want to do this?

1588
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:40,280
Okay!

1589
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:41,300
Her!

1590
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:42,660
Cinderella!

1591
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:43,700
Mori!

1592
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:44,620
Wait!

1593
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:45,800
I have to upgrade Mori too!

1594
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:47,740
And then Mihara!

1595
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:48,520
I'm always ready!

1596
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:49,720
And...

1597
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:52,280
Then we need like one fire I guess!

1598
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:53,160
Wait!

1599
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:53,960
We don't have...

1600
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:54,540
Aw man!

1601
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,320
Chapter 5?

1602
00:58:59,120 --> 00:58:59,740
Wait!

1603
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:00,620
In the...

1604
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:01,860
In the story?

1605
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,600
Guys, I know I could use trial characters.

1606
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,340
But I was trying to get to chapter 5.

1607
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:08,240
And like...

1608
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:09,800
I actually used up all their turns.

1609
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:11,520
Because I forgot I was using trial characters.

1610
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:12,300
I...

1611
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:14,940
I forgot...

1612
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:17,700
I forgot I was using trial characters.

1613
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:18,900
I...

1614
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:20,460
Alright.

1615
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:22,780
This is good, right?

1616
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:24,680
This is a good lineup.

1617
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:26,160
Oh!

1618
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,200
For events are infinite!

1619
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:28,820
Get out of here, Modernia!

1620
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:30,400
She's level 200.

1621
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:33,200
Oh!

1622
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:33,760
Nice!

1623
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,160
That's what I've always wanted.

1624
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:36,960
Alright!

1625
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:37,960
I think...

1626
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:39,340
We can get rid of her then.

1627
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:41,080
And grab...

1628
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:41,700
What's her?

1629
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:42,700
And grab her.

1630
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:44,520
Are you planning on attending class, Commander?

1631
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:44,740
Wait!

1632
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:45,140
Leader!

1633
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:46,880
I heard she was good.

1634
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:47,980
Alright!

1635
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:49,340
We're ready.

1636
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:50,960
Alright!

1637
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:51,360
Nice!

1638
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:51,760
Guys!

1639
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:52,800
Do you think we're gonna win this?

1640
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:55,200
Do you...

1641
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,340
Do you think we're gonna win this event, guys?

1642
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:59,000
I think...

1643
00:59:59,000 --> 00:59:59,240
Wait!

1644
00:59:59,240 --> 00:59:59,980
Do I have burst two?

1645
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:01,820
Do I have burst two?

1646
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:02,380
I don't know.

1647
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:03,240
I can't tell.

1648
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:06,680
One...

1649
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:08,500
Is that a two?

1650
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,080
No, that's a three.

1651
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:11,020
Okay, we have...

1652
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:11,300
Okay.

1653
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:12,300
Fuck!

1654
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:12,620
Okay.

1655
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:15,360
I guess we do need a more...

1656
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:15,500
Wait!

1657
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:16,160
Actually, she's two.

1658
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:17,420
Alright.

1659
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:19,460
One, two, three.

1660
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:21,000
We have so many threes.

1661
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:22,860
But, like, we have to have Mihara there.

1662
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:25,100
Like, we can't replace her, guys.

1663
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:25,640
Right?

1664
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:26,780
She...

1665
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:28,340
She has to be there.

1666
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:29,040
It's mandatory.

1667
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:34,300
I'm not a fairy?

1668
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:38,980
It says there that, like, there's a bonus that we put her in, guys.

1669
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:40,760
It's all about the bonus.

1670
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:43,600
A simple-minded.

1671
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:44,960
Thank you for the hundred pitties.

1672
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:45,280
Thank you.

1673
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:45,880
Thank you.

1674
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:49,180
Wait.

1675
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:51,320
Where am I?

1676
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:54,900
Very...

1677
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:55,380
So cute.

1678
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:55,960
See?

1679
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:56,560
I told you!

1680
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:57,660
She had to be there!

1681
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:00,720
I told you!

1682
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:05,280
Who are you?

1683
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:09,460
What is this place?

1684
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:11,600
Where did you bring me?

1685
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:14,080
We're all Nikkeis, aren't we?

1686
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:16,340
Are you a Nikkei, too?

1687
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:20,440
A Nikkei?

1688
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:21,340
Yeah.

1689
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:21,800
Yeah.

1690
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:23,560
And we're at the bottom of the ocean right now.

1691
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:25,420
You just said you knew you were a Nikkei before.

1692
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:25,860
Is that amazing?

1693
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,060
We're underwater?

1694
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:30,340
We're breathing underwater.

1695
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:30,960
Don't be ridiculous.

1696
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,560
Do you really think I'd fall for that?

1697
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:34,920
I know it's hard to believe.

1698
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:38,760
I was thinking the same thing only a few minutes ago.

1699
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:39,980
What?

1700
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:41,380
Are you ever pulled down here, too?

1701
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:43,900
Yuni and I woke up just a little while ago, too.

1702
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:45,000
Who's Yuni?

1703
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:47,840
It seems like we were in a shipwreck, like you.

1704
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,080
Isn't that right, Yuni?

1705
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:53,440
Wait, is she a playable character, too?

1706
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:54,140
What is going on?

1707
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,860
What are your names, by the way?

1708
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,720
I have to be able to call you something.

1709
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:02,420
You weren't traveling together?

1710
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:04,240
Nope.

1711
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,480
This is my first time seeing her.

1712
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:11,320
Oh, normal Yuni is.

1713
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:12,080
Oh, okay.

1714
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:16,200
And this is my partner, Yuni, who is dear to me.

1715
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:17,780
Cool.

1716
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:18,660
Cool.

1717
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:22,520
As you can see, Yuni is a little different than the usual Nikkei.

1718
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:24,760
She does not need to wrap this around herself.

1719
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:27,660
She communicates with these vocalizations that I personally find adorable.

1720
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:31,300
She still understands everything we're saying, though.

1721
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:33,840
So you'll still be able to communicate with her.

1722
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:34,900
No, no, she does.

1723
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:35,920
You don't understand.

1724
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:37,800
It's part of her programming.

1725
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:39,240
It's part of her programming.

1726
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:44,800
It's more accurate, necessarily.

1727
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:46,600
If she doesn't, she'll die.

1728
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:49,200
She does contain all sorts of wonders.

1729
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:53,500
You don't want her to die, do you, Doki?

1730
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:55,560
Siren.

1731
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:57,960
That's a pretty name.

1732
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
And you, kiddo?

1733
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,420
Who are you calling kiddo?

1734
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:03,700
Yeah.

1735
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:05,880
She's just the same age as you.

1736
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:06,960
Just with...

1737
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,260
Just a little smaller.

1738
01:03:09,580 --> 01:03:09,780
Good.

1739
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:12,260
You know, just like one size smaller.

1740
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:15,280
Any chance you can fill us in on where we are?

1741
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:19,200
I saw you falling into the ocean near the bubble tree.

1742
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,480
I saved you.

1743
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:24,280
And waited until you came too.

1744
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:25,880
Wow.

1745
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:28,020
So you saved us.

1746
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:29,880
Thanks a bunch.

1747
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:33,300
So...

1748
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:35,500
Are we really underwater right now?

1749
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:36,800
Yeah, why aren't your clothes wet?

1750
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:38,780
If they're underwater.

1751
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:41,480
How can we be underwater?

1752
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:44,820
We're all able to breathe perfectly normal.

1753
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:45,340
Yeah.

1754
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,520
Is that transparent barrier protecting us?

1755
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:48,860
Oh!

1756
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:50,200
Barrier?

1757
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:57,060
That's how...

1758
01:03:57,060 --> 01:03:59,060
Wait, does a little mermaid not have to breathe water?

1759
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:01,720
It's actually true.

1760
01:04:02,660 --> 01:04:05,780
So this place really is at the bottom of the ocean?

1761
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:09,080
I never knew a place like this existed.

1762
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:11,340
Who's watering this tree, then?

1763
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:13,940
Could it be a new lost sector?

1764
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:15,740
It's Atlantis!

1765
01:04:16,540 --> 01:04:18,560
Siowyn would certainly be happy to hear that.

1766
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:20,660
How do we get back up?

1767
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:21,880
SpongeBob type shit.

1768
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:22,980
Wet t-shirts.

1769
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:23,360
Now!

1770
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:26,440
My immersion!

1771
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:30,120
Where is my immersion?

1772
01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:32,340
They were in water a moment ago.

1773
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:33,420
Excuse me?

1774
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:36,860
You mean there isn't a way to get back up now?

1775
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:44,120
In other words, we're trapped down here?

1776
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:47,300
Hmm...

1777
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:47,580
No.

1778
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:49,560
This can't be happening.

1779
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:50,800
I need to go.

1780
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:56,140
If I don't get out of here, I'll lose the opportunity I worked so hard for.

1781
01:04:57,340 --> 01:04:59,060
Wait, what's she working for?

1782
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,000
This is all one big lie.

1783
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:04,460
I don't believe we're underwater for a second.

1784
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:05,980
What do you mean?

1785
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:07,600
That's all...

1786
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:09,520
Nanobots.

1787
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:10,960
Yeah, I was gonna say it.

1788
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:13,360
It's all fake.

1789
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:19,100
I'm not waiting around.

1790
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:20,180
Get out of my way.

1791
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:22,480
I've got to get out of here right now.

1792
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:23,660
Yeah, let her swim out.

1793
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:25,420
Then...

1794
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:26,580
Then we'll get what we want.

1795
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:28,680
Oh?

1796
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:34,640
How about we all settle down for a moment and get some food in us first?

1797
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:37,420
Oh, okay.

1798
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:39,620
By getting food, do you mean fight?

1799
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:41,680
Oh, do we have to like...

1800
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,620
Are we fighting the...

1801
01:05:43,620 --> 01:05:45,300
We're fighting for our food!

1802
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:46,040
Oh!

1803
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:48,900
Man, I sure do love...

1804
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:49,280
Okay, guys.

1805
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:49,680
See, look.

1806
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:50,560
I'll play the game.

1807
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:51,620
Wait, where is she?

1808
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:52,200
Give me just a second.

1809
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:53,120
There we go.

1810
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:54,560
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew!

1811
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:55,020
Wait.

1812
01:05:56,540 --> 01:05:57,180
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew!

1813
01:05:57,220 --> 01:05:57,820
Oh my god!

1814
01:05:57,980 --> 01:05:58,800
It's so fast, too.

1815
01:05:58,860 --> 01:05:59,400
The shots.

1816
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:01,460
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew!

1817
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:03,160
Okay, nice.

1818
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:04,100
We'll just shoot that.

1819
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:05,260
Nice.

1820
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:06,720
Alright.

1821
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:10,620
Yeah, it feels like it's SMG when I use her.

1822
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:14,880
It lacked a certain pizzazz, but I'm satisfied.

1823
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:19,200
I like how like her SSR version, she like hit like second puberty.

1824
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:21,320
Like her voice gets deeper.

1825
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:28,120
Alright.

1826
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:31,000
It's okay.

1827
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:34,440
We hunted some robots and now we have food.

1828
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:36,000
What are you looking at?

1829
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:38,120
Is it tasty?

1830
01:06:39,180 --> 01:06:41,720
If it wasn't, do you think I'd be eating it?

1831
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:44,400
Now stop staring at me as I eat.

1832
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:47,440
It's good to see you eating so enthusiastically.

1833
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:50,480
Yeah, like her voice got so deep.

1834
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:52,620
Their SSR version.

1835
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:55,880
Upgrades in many ways.

1836
01:06:58,500 --> 01:06:58,900
Whoa!

1837
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:00,520
Stop calling me cute!

1838
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:01,160
Oh!

1839
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:02,000
B-baka!

1840
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:06,340
Oh no, she's a tsundere.

1841
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,000
Aw,

1842
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,600
she's socially awkward.

1843
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:27,320
Wait, what?

1844
01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:28,480
Just swim up!

1845
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:30,040
That's right.

1846
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:33,920
Still, I will send you all back.

1847
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:35,520
Yeah, I was gonna say, just swim up.

1848
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:40,280
By trying doing the opposite of how I rescued you, it might be possible.

1849
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:43,180
And how did you rescue us?

1850
01:07:44,180 --> 01:07:44,480
Aha!

1851
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:47,160
How did she do it?

1852
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:49,200
Just fly.

1853
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:51,280
Forms at her fingertips.

1854
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:52,520
Yeah, it's a bubble!

1855
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:54,360
Huh?

1856
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:55,600
What is that?

1857
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:57,360
It's a bubble!

1858
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:58,260
It's called a bubble!

1859
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:02,500
I was able to save you by putting you in one of these!

1860
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:02,960
It's a bubble.

1861
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:08,680
Have you not seen a bubble before?

1862
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:11,020
Are you sure you're not a quarry after all?

1863
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:12,860
No way!

1864
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:17,480
Oh my god!

1865
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:19,500
A bubble!

1866
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:21,260
I'm just kidding around.

1867
01:08:22,580 --> 01:08:25,200
So, that's what you use to save us, huh?

1868
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:26,640
Oh!

1869
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:29,860
I have the power of the kotodama!

1870
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:31,200
The kotodama?

1871
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:34,020
The power which I can also imbue the bubbles with!

1872
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:34,700
Oh!

1873
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:37,860
It means I don't have to physically move them myself!

1874
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:42,880
I like how her clothes are, like, based off of, like, fish skills.

1875
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:45,240
Kotodama?

1876
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:45,260
Huh?

1877
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:47,240
What's that?

1878
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:50,860
Are you using this kotodama thing now?

1879
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:52,740
Oh no!

1880
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:54,480
Certainly not!

1881
01:08:55,440 --> 01:09:00,540
In the post-apocalyptic world, people don't- Normally don't see bubbles?

1882
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:03,960
Like, do they not use soap?

1883
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:09,240
Have they never, like, accidentally, like, seen bubbles on soap?

1884
01:09:10,060 --> 01:09:10,400
Like...

1885
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:12,460
Do they not need a shower?

1886
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:13,420
Slash, bathe?

1887
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:18,720
I don't realize what a joyful experience speaking with someone could be!

1888
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:20,160
Oh!

1889
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:21,660
She's an extrovert!

1890
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:24,320
Into a way to form bubbles inside my throat!

1891
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:27,660
As a way to be able to control the kotodama!

1892
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:30,640
Check your pre-apocalypse take privilege!

1893
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,480
And how I won't use the kotodama against either of you accidentally!

1894
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:35,360
Haha!

1895
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:36,740
Good to know!

1896
01:09:37,980 --> 01:09:40,600
Why don't you use that power now and send us back up?

1897
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:42,600
I'm sorry!

1898
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,080
I used too many bubbles when I rescued you!

1899
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:46,760
Aren't they, like...

1900
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:48,180
They're, like, androids, though.

1901
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:49,640
They're, like, partially human.

1902
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:52,760
So when they're, like, human self need, like, you know...

1903
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:55,620
You know, like, you still need to clean your robots, too.

1904
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:56,680
Like, you have to, like...

1905
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:00,900
I can't wait that long.

1906
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:02,480
I need to...

1907
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:03,620
Sorry, and cyborg.

1908
01:10:03,820 --> 01:10:05,140
I keep, like, getting mixed up.

1909
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:06,040
Maybe I can swim out of here somehow.

1910
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,320
If you leave this bubble, you will die!

1911
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:11,820
I forgot human...

1912
01:10:11,820 --> 01:10:12,780
Humanoid robots.

1913
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:15,300
I would get mixed up between cyborgs and androids.

1914
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:18,740
Androids is, like, they look like humans, but they're not actually humans.

1915
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,300
And cyborg is, like, partially human.

1916
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,120
How am I supposed to trust a stranger I just met?

1917
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:26,680
I thought some of them were, like...

1918
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:27,240
Part...

1919
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:28,300
Like, cyborgs, though.

1920
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:30,100
Yeah, the brain is lit.

1921
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:30,340
Oh!

1922
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:31,980
I'm going to...

1923
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:33,480
Mori.

1924
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:36,180
It would be best not to leave.

1925
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:39,460
Are you really taking her at her word?

1926
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:41,140
I am.

1927
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:44,680
She seems quite certain of what she's saying.

1928
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:46,980
There must be a reason for that.

1929
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:50,500
What?

1930
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:51,840
Oh, so they're full of...

1931
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,980
So, like, whatever scientists design...

1932
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:56,760
Mihara!

1933
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:05,900
I just assumed, because I thought they were cyborgs, that Mihara requested this.

1934
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:08,500
Because that's, like, her past self.

1935
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:09,520
But...

1936
01:11:12,260 --> 01:11:13,480
Now I understand.

1937
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:13,900
I promise.

1938
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:16,960
Ah...

1939
01:11:17,260 --> 01:11:18,580
So please...

1940
01:11:18,580 --> 01:11:21,720
Be patient and wait for a little while.

1941
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:24,920
Hmm...

1942
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:25,760
A little while.

1943
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:29,360
I'm going to be waiting for an entire month.

1944
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:30,940
Fine.

1945
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:32,780
But not a moment longer.

1946
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:34,920
Oh!

1947
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:41,340
And bodies that match with what they felt comfortable with as humans, else they go haywire.

1948
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:41,400
Why?

1949
01:11:41,740 --> 01:11:44,580
Okay, I don't want to know why Mihara wanted upgrades.

1950
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:45,440
I...

1951
01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:50,740
They're like, I don't feel comfortable with this body anymore.

1952
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:52,520
I need more.

1953
01:11:53,060 --> 01:11:56,960
Is there anything we can do to help while you make the bubble for our escape?

1954
01:12:01,070 --> 01:12:03,350
It was necessary, Doki.

1955
01:12:04,270 --> 01:12:05,370
Or she'll die!

1956
01:12:08,930 --> 01:12:18,450
Guys, if you guys want to find out why Mihara needed upgrades, make sure to click the link pinned in chat or use exclamation point Nikkei to find out yourself.

1957
01:12:18,450 --> 01:12:19,970
If you guys want to take this out, give us something back.

1958
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:22,670
Please, let us help.

1959
01:12:23,330 --> 01:12:23,970
We can do anything.

1960
01:12:23,970 --> 01:12:24,330
Guys, she needed this.

1961
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:26,010
Or she'll fucking die!

1962
01:12:28,810 --> 01:12:30,490
In that case...

1963
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:36,010
Alright, nice.

1964
01:12:38,370 --> 01:12:39,570
Do we need to get to...

1965
01:12:40,150 --> 01:12:42,350
How far do we have to get to to unlock the minigame?

1966
01:12:42,490 --> 01:12:42,910
Like five?

1967
01:12:43,270 --> 01:12:43,890
One five?

1968
01:12:44,090 --> 01:12:45,210
Like, is it one five?

1969
01:12:45,210 --> 01:12:47,890
Or is it, like, all the way to...

1970
01:12:48,390 --> 01:12:49,530
He... at the end?

1971
01:12:50,270 --> 01:12:51,410
Just get to one five?

1972
01:12:51,630 --> 01:12:51,830
Okay.

1973
01:12:52,210 --> 01:12:52,870
Just one five.

1974
01:12:53,230 --> 01:12:53,630
Alright.

1975
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:03,450
Okay, I want to use...

1976
01:13:03,450 --> 01:13:05,010
I want to use...

1977
01:13:05,610 --> 01:13:07,430
The person I got in one try.

1978
01:13:07,830 --> 01:13:09,630
Okay, we just need a big boss to come in.

1979
01:13:09,830 --> 01:13:10,630
Jesus, her...

1980
01:13:10,630 --> 01:13:12,250
Her gun is so fast.

1981
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:13,050
The SMG?

1982
01:13:13,850 --> 01:13:16,930
It does feel like an SMG because it actually happens so fast.

1983
01:13:17,050 --> 01:13:17,330
Like...

1984
01:13:17,330 --> 01:13:18,590
Like, they barely survive.

1985
01:13:19,310 --> 01:13:20,290
Also, to be fair...

1986
01:13:21,190 --> 01:13:21,790
Um...

1987
01:13:21,790 --> 01:13:23,010
I am, like...

1988
01:13:23,010 --> 01:13:25,130
50,000 above the power level.

1989
01:13:27,150 --> 01:13:30,070
What a truly beautiful story this was.

1990
01:13:30,310 --> 01:13:32,410
I am most pleased with it.

1991
01:13:32,990 --> 01:13:33,390
Alright.

1992
01:13:33,950 --> 01:13:34,710
One three.

1993
01:13:35,030 --> 01:13:35,830
Yeah, I am 50.

1994
01:13:36,070 --> 01:13:37,410
Guys, do you think I win?

1995
01:13:40,630 --> 01:13:41,930
I'm not sure yet.

1996
01:13:42,270 --> 01:13:42,870
But...

1997
01:13:42,870 --> 01:13:44,310
I think I might win this.

1998
01:13:45,410 --> 01:13:47,050
I almost skipped the story.

1999
01:13:47,050 --> 01:13:47,690
All this stuff.

2000
01:13:54,790 --> 01:13:58,250
The story remains of plants, buildings, submarines, and more life scattered around.

2001
01:13:58,730 --> 01:13:59,930
Oh my god, she is like a little mermaid.

2002
01:14:00,230 --> 01:14:01,810
I'm certain that I've seen it before.

2003
01:14:02,050 --> 01:14:02,530
Look at this stuff.

2004
01:14:03,090 --> 01:14:04,090
Isn't it neat?

2005
01:14:04,790 --> 01:14:05,590
An AA pillar?

2006
01:14:06,290 --> 01:14:06,770
Oh!

2007
01:14:07,690 --> 01:14:09,530
So that's what it's called.

2008
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:11,550
Oh my god, we're in Gluttony!

2009
01:14:11,990 --> 01:14:14,090
The point of our energy still stored inside it.

2010
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:14,830
But it seems to have stopped working.

2011
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:16,470
That's why we can't leave.

2012
01:14:17,250 --> 01:14:19,990
It's like the Gluttony swallowed the A pillar.

2013
01:14:22,550 --> 01:14:25,910
There sure are a lot of fascinating things in this place.

2014
01:14:27,190 --> 01:14:28,490
So it is war!

2015
01:14:28,710 --> 01:14:29,590
We're in the stomach!

2016
01:14:30,890 --> 01:14:31,570
Let me guess.

2017
01:14:31,770 --> 01:14:34,210
You want us to start rummaging through this stuff.

2018
01:14:38,510 --> 01:14:42,230
Look around and bring back anything that appears useful.

2019
01:14:42,450 --> 01:14:45,170
Yeah, cause earlier they're like, He swallowed an AA pillar.

2020
01:14:47,770 --> 01:14:49,250
Always comes back to war.

2021
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:03,540
Always comes back to war.

2022
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,800
It's okay, just get out your credit card.

2023
01:15:09,020 --> 01:15:11,920
You don't have to scavenge anything.

2024
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:12,940
Just get out your...

2025
01:15:12,940 --> 01:15:14,620
Just get out the commander's credit card.

2026
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:16,980
We'll buy our way out of here.

2027
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:24,500
Sifting through wreckage for valuable items sounds fun to me.

2028
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:28,040
Namaste gifter, thank you for gifting a sub to Vore.

2029
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:30,780
Pay the lead!

2030
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:31,900
Let's go!

2031
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:34,180
Good luck making those bubbles, Siren.

2032
01:15:39,930 --> 01:15:41,470
Make my bubbles now.

2033
01:15:41,830 --> 01:15:42,630
What the heck are those?

2034
01:15:44,810 --> 01:15:46,070
Oh, it's the bubbles!

2035
01:15:49,350 --> 01:15:49,850
Right.

2036
01:15:50,570 --> 01:15:52,330
Those are all made up of bubbles.

2037
01:15:53,370 --> 01:15:56,010
Didn't you say they were robots of some kind?

2038
01:15:58,690 --> 01:15:59,490
Bounce, bounce!

2039
01:16:00,130 --> 01:16:02,350
Oh my god, the bubbles have their own voice actors.

2040
01:16:02,870 --> 01:16:03,370
Hmph.

2041
01:16:03,890 --> 01:16:05,550
I've never seen robots that playful.

2042
01:16:05,810 --> 01:16:06,790
Welcome, Vore.

2043
01:16:07,130 --> 01:16:07,630
No, wait!

2044
01:16:07,830 --> 01:16:09,330
Vore is real?!

2045
01:16:10,010 --> 01:16:10,930
Go away!

2046
01:16:11,170 --> 01:16:12,510
Oh my god!

2047
01:16:13,070 --> 01:16:14,130
He's real!

2048
01:16:16,810 --> 01:16:17,370
I'm sorry.

2049
01:16:17,370 --> 01:16:18,350
I'm like looking at...

2050
01:16:18,350 --> 01:16:18,970
Oh my god!

2051
01:16:19,090 --> 01:16:21,110
And he has Minecraft 15th anniversary!

2052
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:23,030
Cute!

2053
01:16:23,610 --> 01:16:24,370
No way!

2054
01:16:24,370 --> 01:16:26,110
Surely it wouldn't hurt to touch it.

2055
01:16:26,470 --> 01:16:27,350
Just once.

2056
01:16:27,570 --> 01:16:28,930
I thought it was just a concept!

2057
01:16:28,930 --> 01:16:29,610
Yeah!

2058
01:16:29,610 --> 01:16:30,170
Ha ha ha ha ha!

2059
01:16:30,350 --> 01:16:30,910
Gah!

2060
01:16:34,070 --> 01:16:34,630
What?

2061
01:16:34,810 --> 01:16:35,430
What is it?

2062
01:16:36,090 --> 01:16:38,850
I thought you'd be lonely over here by yourself.

2063
01:16:40,090 --> 01:16:41,010
Well, think again.

2064
01:16:42,090 --> 01:16:43,290
I'm not lonely at all.

2065
01:16:43,990 --> 01:16:44,810
I see.

2066
01:16:45,210 --> 01:16:46,610
You're very impressive.

2067
01:16:47,570 --> 01:16:49,290
Don't treat me like a little kid.

2068
01:16:50,330 --> 01:16:51,650
All right, all right.

2069
01:16:53,010 --> 01:16:54,010
So cute.

2070
01:16:54,930 --> 01:16:56,830
Why did you really come over here?

2071
01:16:57,310 --> 01:16:57,750
Yeah.

2072
01:16:58,130 --> 01:17:00,350
Are you trying to pilfer everything that I gathered?

2073
01:17:01,290 --> 01:17:01,710
Huh?

2074
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:03,390
We're all here to work together!

2075
01:17:03,830 --> 01:17:06,730
Or do you want me to head over to your side and help you find more stuff?

2076
01:17:07,870 --> 01:17:08,310
Hmm.

2077
01:17:09,550 --> 01:17:11,290
Why is she so like...

2078
01:17:11,290 --> 01:17:11,410
If that's the case, then get lost.

2079
01:17:11,410 --> 01:17:12,490
Why does she trust anybody?

2080
01:17:12,970 --> 01:17:13,750
I'll do no such thing.

2081
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:16,130
I'm not after any of that.

2082
01:17:16,130 --> 01:17:18,890
Doki, you need to play up to chapter 30 to find out.

2083
01:17:19,330 --> 01:17:20,870
Why would I do any of that stuff?

2084
01:17:21,090 --> 01:17:22,170
I can read your minds.

2085
01:17:22,330 --> 01:17:24,090
I know that is exactly what you guys are gonna say.

2086
01:17:24,090 --> 01:17:24,170
Okay.

2087
01:17:25,290 --> 01:17:27,610
It's just a small task that Siren gave us.

2088
01:17:30,130 --> 01:17:30,710
Oh.

2089
01:17:31,370 --> 01:17:31,950
Right.

2090
01:17:32,830 --> 01:17:35,430
I guess this isn't an official mission or anything.

2091
01:17:36,650 --> 01:17:37,030
Hmm.

2092
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:38,210
Where are their commanders?

2093
01:17:39,250 --> 01:17:40,450
Wait, that's me!

2094
01:17:42,270 --> 01:17:42,850
Everyone...

2095
01:17:42,850 --> 01:17:46,190
Everyone's like, oh my god, what happened to her?

2096
01:17:46,650 --> 01:17:49,450
We are going to be spending a lot of time together.

2097
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:51,890
But I don't know anything about you.

2098
01:17:52,870 --> 01:17:54,550
And it's going to stay that way.

2099
01:17:55,470 --> 01:17:58,850
As soon as I leave this place, I won't see you ever again.

2100
01:18:00,010 --> 01:18:00,330
Yeah.

2101
01:18:01,090 --> 01:18:02,430
Wait, but I thought they were all like...

2102
01:18:02,430 --> 01:18:06,150
If they're all Nikes, then wouldn't they all like, eventually like, bump into each other?

2103
01:18:06,570 --> 01:18:08,210
Because they're all like...

2104
01:18:08,210 --> 01:18:10,850
I assume they all come from the same factory, right?

2105
01:18:11,750 --> 01:18:12,150
Sorry.

2106
01:18:12,430 --> 01:18:13,970
I didn't mean to disturb you.

2107
01:18:14,910 --> 01:18:15,730
We'll leave you be.

2108
01:18:16,730 --> 01:18:17,270
See you later.

2109
01:18:17,270 --> 01:18:17,410
No?

2110
01:18:19,310 --> 01:18:20,110
They don't...

2111
01:18:20,110 --> 01:18:20,790
Not really?

2112
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:22,950
They don't come from the same factory?

2113
01:18:23,450 --> 01:18:23,590
Where are you looking at?

2114
01:18:23,590 --> 01:18:25,390
I thought like, Nikkei was like a trademark.

2115
01:18:25,790 --> 01:18:26,450
Like, you know, like...

2116
01:18:27,490 --> 01:18:27,890
Um...

2117
01:18:27,890 --> 01:18:28,930
Like, from...

2118
01:18:28,930 --> 01:18:29,750
Honda Civic?

2119
01:18:30,230 --> 01:18:30,590
You know?

2120
01:18:30,810 --> 01:18:32,650
Like, I thought it was a factory name.

2121
01:18:32,830 --> 01:18:34,350
I didn't realize it was like...

2122
01:18:34,870 --> 01:18:38,090
Just like, you know, they're just called robots, but they're called Nikkeis instead.

2123
01:18:38,090 --> 01:18:38,870
So...

2124
01:18:39,970 --> 01:18:40,630
You know?

2125
01:18:40,890 --> 01:18:42,290
They all come from the same...

2126
01:18:43,310 --> 01:18:45,270
They all come from the same factory.

2127
01:18:46,750 --> 01:18:47,970
She has no idea.

2128
01:18:48,250 --> 01:18:48,690
Oh, it's like a...

2129
01:18:48,690 --> 01:18:49,490
It's like a phone.

2130
01:18:49,970 --> 01:18:50,990
She doesn't know who I tracked.

2131
01:18:51,870 --> 01:18:53,910
Or what kind of mission I was given.

2132
01:18:55,970 --> 01:18:58,110
Oh, so there's three main manufacturers.

2133
01:18:58,630 --> 01:18:58,750
You just need to do one thing.

2134
01:18:58,750 --> 01:19:00,850
Wait, can there be bootleg Nikkeis then?

2135
01:19:02,170 --> 01:19:02,650
Whoa.

2136
01:19:02,970 --> 01:19:04,130
Just tell me what they choose.

2137
01:19:04,970 --> 01:19:07,510
That is uncomfortable for her boob.

2138
01:19:08,260 --> 01:19:08,730
Like...

2139
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:13,760
Are there bootleg Nikkeis?

2140
01:19:14,110 --> 01:19:14,370
One month left.

2141
01:19:16,510 --> 01:19:17,450
Yeah.

2142
01:19:18,030 --> 01:19:18,490
Simple.

2143
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:20,730
Maybe for you all.

2144
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:22,810
Bunch of liars.

2145
01:19:27,550 --> 01:19:29,130
Kinda, but no?

2146
01:19:30,310 --> 01:19:32,910
Why hasn't anyone made like...

2147
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,370
Why hasn't anyone made like...

2148
01:19:35,370 --> 01:19:36,430
Counterfeit Nikkeis?

2149
01:19:38,170 --> 01:19:39,690
They can be...

2150
01:19:39,690 --> 01:19:41,690
They can be cheaper and...

2151
01:19:44,510 --> 01:19:45,410
Wouldn't that be better?

2152
01:19:45,770 --> 01:19:46,550
More affordable?

2153
01:19:47,570 --> 01:19:48,870
Even you can...

2154
01:19:48,870 --> 01:19:50,650
Even you can own a Nikkei.

2155
01:19:52,870 --> 01:19:54,490
Ask the government.

2156
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:55,850
Get your...

2157
01:19:55,850 --> 01:19:59,370
Get your Nikkei robot on the street for $5.

2158
01:19:59,370 --> 01:19:59,990
Lot, you know?

2159
01:20:00,070 --> 01:20:00,730
Like those tables.

2160
01:20:01,250 --> 01:20:02,730
Where you can like...

2161
01:20:02,730 --> 01:20:02,850
I am most pleased with it.

2162
01:20:02,850 --> 01:20:03,990
Bootleg DVDs and stuff.

2163
01:20:04,330 --> 01:20:05,610
Imagine if they're like in...

2164
01:20:07,130 --> 01:20:09,730
In like off-brand like designer bags.

2165
01:20:13,550 --> 01:20:15,390
Imagine you just grab and...

2166
01:20:15,950 --> 01:20:17,590
Buy like a cheaper Nikkei there.

2167
01:20:18,150 --> 01:20:21,670
Might not be as good, but...

2168
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:39,020
What are you making that face for?

2169
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:41,900
You gathered so much!

2170
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:42,120
We did!

2171
01:20:42,700 --> 01:20:45,280
Yeah, we killed a lot of robots for this.

2172
01:20:45,980 --> 01:20:46,360
Wow!

2173
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:48,160
That's not that much, is it?

2174
01:20:50,060 --> 01:20:51,100
Are you happy?

2175
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:52,660
Yeah!

2176
01:20:53,900 --> 01:20:57,440
I didn't know so many things were hiding in there.

2177
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:00,300
Did you never search that place?

2178
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:02,340
Uh-huh.

2179
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:04,840
I mean, she could barely talk.

2180
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:05,720
I never needed much when I was alone.

2181
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,600
Yeah, she just existed.

2182
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,140
Wait, does she like, have to eat?

2183
01:21:15,220 --> 01:21:16,740
Do Nikkei's have to eat?

2184
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:17,480
But they're robots.

2185
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:19,360
I guess you gotta give them oil, right?

2186
01:21:20,980 --> 01:21:23,120
Or I guess charge their batteries?

2187
01:21:32,770 --> 01:21:34,090
They have to eat and drink?

2188
01:21:34,170 --> 01:21:36,750
What's the point of being a robot if you have to eat?

2189
01:21:39,070 --> 01:21:40,250
That's so pain.

2190
01:21:40,510 --> 01:21:41,070
That's so pain.

2191
01:21:41,070 --> 01:21:41,310
That's like...

2192
01:21:41,310 --> 01:21:43,870
That's like some fucked up shit the factory did.

2193
01:21:45,410 --> 01:21:47,830
They're just like...

2194
01:21:50,830 --> 01:21:53,090
It's to pretend to be alive.

2195
01:21:53,790 --> 01:21:56,930
What kind of person programmed that into them?

2196
01:21:56,930 --> 01:21:58,430
Are you sure it's okay to use a bubble cycle?

2197
01:21:58,430 --> 01:21:59,650
Just delete it out of their mind.

2198
01:22:00,890 --> 01:22:02,470
What if it delays our escape?

2199
01:22:03,790 --> 01:22:04,630
Oh, is it stopped?

2200
01:22:04,770 --> 01:22:05,810
Oh, I know about the switching.

2201
01:22:05,970 --> 01:22:06,690
I remember that.

2202
01:22:13,450 --> 01:22:17,770
Oh, I see.

2203
01:22:17,890 --> 01:22:19,270
It's like a psychological thing.

2204
01:22:21,370 --> 01:22:27,810
Yeah, but if they can manipulate their mind, just delete the concept of drinking and eating from their mind.

2205
01:22:29,350 --> 01:22:32,590
And just like reprogram, be like, humans do not need to eat or drink.

2206
01:22:32,870 --> 01:22:34,250
And then write that as a code file.

2207
01:22:35,650 --> 01:22:36,370
You know?

2208
01:22:36,690 --> 01:22:38,230
Just manipulate the mind.

2209
01:22:38,870 --> 01:22:41,210
That's inhumane.

2210
01:22:41,730 --> 01:22:46,650
They're wasting food in apocalyptic society.

2211
01:22:52,690 --> 01:22:55,610
We have to save food.

2212
01:22:57,630 --> 01:22:59,010
Good night, Siren.

2213
01:22:59,410 --> 01:23:00,510
See you tomorrow.

2214
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:09,320
I want to go, too.

2215
01:23:10,660 --> 01:23:11,740
You're going to go outside?

2216
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:12,400
Yeah.

2217
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:13,560
Let's go outside.

2218
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:15,860
Siren made these beds for us.

2219
01:23:16,180 --> 01:23:17,860
She needs some fresh air.

2220
01:23:24,130 --> 01:23:40,450
All I'm saying is like, if they're robots, we can act, given literally soiled acid, the Nikkeis are mistreated enough.

2221
01:23:40,450 --> 01:23:50,750
I'm saying, we can program, we can delete in the code, we can just write a quick code and be like, Nikkeis don't need to, as a human, you don't need to eat or drink.

2222
01:23:50,750 --> 01:23:51,810
Why not?

2223
01:23:52,610 --> 01:23:55,890
Because she started following us while we were inside the ark.

2224
01:23:56,150 --> 01:23:57,570
It's just simple coding.

2225
01:23:58,650 --> 01:24:01,190
I figured that was why you felt that way.

2226
01:24:02,050 --> 01:24:03,610
Don't be too harsh on her.

2227
01:24:04,390 --> 01:24:06,870
I'm sure she has her reasons for doing it.

2228
01:24:08,290 --> 01:24:10,910
I mean, she is, like, going through a lot right now.

2229
01:24:11,150 --> 01:24:13,870
If you're not fond of her, I guess there's not what you can do about that.

2230
01:24:13,870 --> 01:24:15,290
That food and eating was false.

2231
01:24:15,870 --> 01:24:16,330
Exactly!

2232
01:24:16,590 --> 01:24:17,610
It's so simple!

2233
01:24:19,830 --> 01:24:21,090
I love that.

2234
01:24:21,290 --> 01:24:22,310
That's a great code.

2235
01:24:22,510 --> 01:24:23,970
We already wrote the code for her.

2236
01:24:26,210 --> 01:24:26,850
You do.

2237
01:24:27,930 --> 01:24:29,810
Is it because she talks like you do?

2238
01:24:32,370 --> 01:24:34,110
And because she rescued us?

2239
01:24:37,910 --> 01:24:38,710
You're right.

2240
01:24:39,510 --> 01:24:40,790
She rescued us.

2241
01:24:41,010 --> 01:24:43,270
And now she's doing her best to help us.

2242
01:24:43,930 --> 01:24:46,010
I don't think she's a bad person.

2243
01:24:46,870 --> 01:24:50,170
Even though I don't think everything she's telling us is the truth.

2244
01:24:51,650 --> 01:24:52,210
Cuckoo!

2245
01:24:53,370 --> 01:24:54,370
Why do I think that?

2246
01:24:55,130 --> 01:24:56,850
Oh my gosh, she can read clues.

2247
01:24:57,310 --> 01:25:00,630
Remember that big mouth thing we saw before we lost consciousness?

2248
01:25:01,050 --> 01:25:02,350
Oh, they got bored.

2249
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:08,660
That's where they got bored.

2250
01:25:13,540 --> 01:25:15,320
If I was a...

2251
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:16,600
Nikkei researcher...

2252
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:18,780
I'd add that code into their minds.

2253
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:20,920
I'm exhausted.

2254
01:25:21,780 --> 01:25:23,600
What is up with this dirt?

2255
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:27,800
I thought it would be soft, but it's practically hard as rock.

2256
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:29,040
Stop.

2257
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:31,220
Is there gold mixed into this stuff or what?

2258
01:25:34,890 --> 01:25:35,530
Oh?

2259
01:25:41,590 --> 01:25:43,330
Finally, I feel at ease.

2260
01:25:44,130 --> 01:25:45,800
Everything has been so...

2261
01:25:46,450 --> 01:25:47,190
Uncomfortable.

2262
01:25:48,310 --> 01:25:50,390
Was the bed that uncomfortable?

2263
01:25:50,750 --> 01:25:51,110
Aw.

2264
01:25:52,770 --> 01:25:54,770
Aw, you made her sad.

2265
01:25:55,570 --> 01:25:57,750
She made a bed for you.

2266
01:26:07,750 --> 01:26:10,670
Oh, you made the bubble sad.

2267
01:26:10,890 --> 01:26:10,970
Oh, you made the bubble sad.

2268
01:26:11,230 --> 01:26:12,250
It sounded like digging.

2269
01:26:14,930 --> 01:26:16,550
Is that not allowed?

2270
01:26:17,410 --> 01:26:19,030
No, it's fine.

2271
01:26:20,070 --> 01:26:20,430
Good.

2272
01:26:22,170 --> 01:26:23,830
Then don't worry about it.

2273
01:26:24,010 --> 01:26:24,930
And move along.

2274
01:26:25,630 --> 01:26:27,190
I'm comfortable here.

2275
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:29,710
Yeah, she wants to sleep in dirt.

2276
01:26:29,970 --> 01:26:31,370
You don't understand her.

2277
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:33,290
Huh?

2278
01:26:34,810 --> 01:26:35,110
What?

2279
01:26:35,430 --> 01:26:36,830
Why aren't you leaving?

2280
01:26:37,970 --> 01:26:38,570
Mori?

2281
01:26:39,610 --> 01:26:40,270
What?

2282
01:26:40,630 --> 01:26:42,910
Does it bother you that I dug up the ground?

2283
01:26:43,530 --> 01:26:45,630
Do you like cute things?

2284
01:26:45,970 --> 01:26:46,310
Aw.

2285
01:26:46,890 --> 01:26:47,930
Excuse me?

2286
01:26:48,750 --> 01:26:49,270
Oh.

2287
01:26:50,190 --> 01:26:52,730
Do you want to see me make bubbles?

2288
01:26:53,290 --> 01:26:55,070
That's all she can do.

2289
01:26:55,070 --> 01:26:58,350
And she's like, that does not work.

2290
01:26:58,590 --> 01:26:59,670
Try second option.

2291
01:27:00,170 --> 01:27:00,930
Make bubbles.

2292
01:27:03,190 --> 01:27:04,710
He's like, I don't understand.

2293
01:27:05,030 --> 01:27:06,250
Why don't you like bubbles?

2294
01:27:06,750 --> 01:27:07,590
It's not like I have anything better to do.

2295
01:27:12,070 --> 01:27:12,650
Nice.

2296
01:27:12,930 --> 01:27:13,630
She did it.

2297
01:27:15,550 --> 01:27:16,030
Yay!

2298
01:27:16,870 --> 01:27:17,190
Nice.

2299
01:27:17,310 --> 01:27:18,030
Two more chapters.

2300
01:27:18,030 --> 01:27:19,230
All I'm saying...

2301
01:27:21,650 --> 01:27:23,910
I will not back down from this.

2302
01:27:24,270 --> 01:27:25,410
I know you guys...

2303
01:27:25,410 --> 01:27:26,930
You guys are like, oh my God.

2304
01:27:26,930 --> 01:27:28,590
Doki does not care.

2305
01:27:28,770 --> 01:27:29,950
All I'm saying...

2306
01:27:29,950 --> 01:27:32,190
If I put that in there...

2307
01:27:32,190 --> 01:27:33,910
In the coding...

2308
01:27:33,910 --> 01:27:36,490
Like, because their brains are programmed, right?

2309
01:27:36,570 --> 01:27:38,490
Like, their brains are still from previous humans.

2310
01:27:38,490 --> 01:27:41,770
But they just copy the consciousness into the robot.

2311
01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:44,710
So I can add a code in there.

2312
01:27:46,190 --> 01:27:47,990
And this fixes everything.

2313
01:27:50,830 --> 01:27:51,910
Sorry, I forgot.

2314
01:27:51,910 --> 01:27:53,750
There's one more code that we need to add.

2315
01:27:55,730 --> 01:27:56,970
We need...

2316
01:27:58,170 --> 01:27:58,790
Drink.

2317
01:27:59,130 --> 01:27:59,750
Need.

2318
01:28:01,050 --> 01:28:01,670
False.

2319
01:28:02,090 --> 01:28:03,050
There you go.

2320
01:28:03,450 --> 01:28:04,210
There you go.

2321
01:28:04,350 --> 01:28:05,710
That's all we need to add.

2322
01:28:05,710 --> 01:28:07,490
And then we fix the world.

2323
01:28:08,110 --> 01:28:08,490
We...

2324
01:28:09,230 --> 01:28:09,710
Okay.

2325
01:28:09,930 --> 01:28:10,470
And then...

2326
01:28:10,470 --> 01:28:10,610
Okay.

2327
01:28:10,690 --> 01:28:11,410
They'll go insane.

2328
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:11,870
Okay.

2329
01:28:11,990 --> 01:28:12,090
Here.

2330
01:28:12,150 --> 01:28:12,850
This is what I'll do.

2331
01:28:13,170 --> 01:28:14,010
This is what I'll do.

2332
01:28:14,190 --> 01:28:15,210
If they'll go insane.

2333
01:28:20,430 --> 01:28:20,910
Sane.

2334
01:28:24,790 --> 01:28:25,270
There.

2335
01:28:25,870 --> 01:28:27,350
That's how I'll fix them.

2336
01:28:31,750 --> 01:28:32,710
There we go.

2337
01:28:32,950 --> 01:28:34,050
I fixed them.

2338
01:28:35,110 --> 01:28:36,510
That's how I'll do it.

2339
01:28:36,710 --> 01:28:38,490
It's just that easy.

2340
01:28:39,410 --> 01:28:42,390
That would make them more insane.

2341
01:28:42,810 --> 01:28:43,910
I got it, guys.

2342
01:28:45,090 --> 01:28:46,030
Programming 101.

2343
01:28:50,870 --> 01:28:53,050
It's time I teach all of you a lesson.

2344
01:28:53,250 --> 01:28:53,510
Alright.

2345
01:28:53,730 --> 01:28:54,190
Let's go.

2346
01:28:55,010 --> 01:28:55,910
I can't...

2347
01:28:55,910 --> 01:28:57,090
What do you mean?

2348
01:28:57,330 --> 01:28:58,610
I'm just coding!

2349
01:29:01,470 --> 01:29:02,010
Alright.

2350
01:29:02,090 --> 01:29:04,590
Let me get rid of these and find more food, I guess.

2351
01:29:06,470 --> 01:29:09,250
It's the final boss of Nikkei.

2352
01:29:09,310 --> 01:29:10,950
What am I doing wrong?

2353
01:29:11,110 --> 01:29:12,250
I don't understand.

2354
01:29:12,950 --> 01:29:14,730
I'm just trying to code.

2355
01:29:20,150 --> 01:29:24,410
The story will be rewritten into a tale that's happy and beautiful.

2356
01:29:25,110 --> 01:29:25,130
Yeah.

2357
01:29:27,370 --> 01:29:27,990
Alright.

2358
01:29:28,430 --> 01:29:28,510
Alright.

2359
01:29:28,510 --> 01:29:29,710
And then we'll have Bubble March.

2360
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:37,120
Alright.

2361
01:29:37,420 --> 01:29:37,640
Whoa!

2362
01:29:38,160 --> 01:29:38,920
Is there a home?

2363
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:40,480
It's her workshop.

2364
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,040
Welcome to the Bubble Workshop!

2365
01:29:45,620 --> 01:29:48,520
I can't believe this is what was underneath that tree.

2366
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:51,680
Bounce, bounce!

2367
01:29:52,780 --> 01:29:54,760
Oh, she made a home in the trees.

2368
01:29:57,080 --> 01:29:58,600
What is this place?

2369
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:02,700
It's packed with all sorts of cute things.

2370
01:30:03,620 --> 01:30:04,780
Do you like it?

2371
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:07,120
Who said I liked it?

2372
01:30:07,780 --> 01:30:08,420
Baka!

2373
01:30:08,780 --> 01:30:09,980
She's so soon today.

2374
01:30:12,260 --> 01:30:15,020
At the very least, it's not boring.

2375
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:16,700
Oh yeah, look at this stuff.

2376
01:30:17,180 --> 01:30:18,300
I'm glad I feel that way!

2377
01:30:20,380 --> 01:30:22,520
So, what do I need to do now?

2378
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:25,360
Hello?

2379
01:30:25,820 --> 01:30:27,120
Don't you want something from me?

2380
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:32,160
Then why did you bring me here?

2381
01:30:33,180 --> 01:30:35,860
Being on your own can be a lonely thing.

2382
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:38,320
Yeah, you don't want to be alone, right?

2383
01:30:39,260 --> 01:30:41,560
I never said I was lonely or scared.

2384
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:43,940
Don't go drawing any conclusions.

2385
01:30:44,060 --> 01:30:45,560
Bro, you have a lot of issues, Mori.

2386
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:48,840
Well, I'm glad to be proven wrong.

2387
01:30:49,780 --> 01:30:52,220
I came to that conclusion because...

2388
01:30:52,220 --> 01:30:54,180
That's how I used to be.

2389
01:30:54,860 --> 01:30:55,940
You were?

2390
01:30:56,740 --> 01:30:57,720
Uh-huh.

2391
01:30:58,880 --> 01:30:59,280
But...

2392
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:01,000
She doesn't know what love is.

2393
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:03,620
I can't imagine you ever feeling lonely.

2394
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:06,600
Everyone is at their weakest...

2395
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:09,560
I can't imagine you ever being lonely.

2396
01:31:09,700 --> 01:31:12,680
She's been trapped in here alone for seven years.

2397
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:15,100
What the fuck do you mean?

2398
01:31:16,140 --> 01:31:17,780
I felt lonely.

2399
01:31:17,780 --> 01:31:21,500
She really has never talked to anybody before.

2400
01:31:27,740 --> 01:31:29,740
People can get lonely?

2401
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:35,020
Stop you.

2402
01:31:35,580 --> 01:31:35,800
Sorry.

2403
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:39,920
She should have the dollar sign lonely...

2404
01:31:41,020 --> 01:31:46,120
Dollar sign lonely underscore need equals false.

2405
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:49,660
There we go.

2406
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:50,340
We fixed her.

2407
01:31:54,220 --> 01:31:54,740
What is this?

2408
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:56,640
Why are you giving me this?

2409
01:31:57,060 --> 01:31:57,700
What did she do?

2410
01:31:57,800 --> 01:31:59,000
Hugging onto this...

2411
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:01,540
Will help you sleep better.

2412
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:07,160
Oh, it's like a little cuddle buddy.

2413
01:32:09,260 --> 01:32:10,200
What's your deal?

2414
01:32:12,540 --> 01:32:13,080
Oh...

2415
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:14,580
Why are you so meaner?

2416
01:32:15,180 --> 01:32:16,140
Yeah, this is B.

2417
01:32:16,140 --> 01:32:18,020
Why are you being mean to someone nice to you?

2418
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:23,360
Why are you going to such great lengths to save us?

2419
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:23,700
Stop.

2420
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:26,180
She doesn't understand what you're talking about.

2421
01:32:26,660 --> 01:32:28,300
She literally learned how to talk.

2422
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:30,700
Speak easier words.

2423
01:32:30,980 --> 01:32:33,160
Why are you acting like you don't expect anything from us in return?

2424
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:36,220
I just wanted to rescue you.

2425
01:32:36,740 --> 01:32:37,980
So I did.

2426
01:32:38,860 --> 01:32:41,240
And I simply wanted to be nice.

2427
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:43,220
So I did.

2428
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:44,900
Stop confusing your...

2429
01:32:44,900 --> 01:32:45,620
Mori.

2430
01:32:46,540 --> 01:32:47,180
Whoa!

2431
01:32:47,940 --> 01:32:48,560
Makes me uncomfortable.

2432
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:51,200
Don't act all high and mighty.

2433
01:32:52,240 --> 01:32:52,540
Whoa!

2434
01:32:52,940 --> 01:32:54,140
If you want something, just say it.

2435
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:55,880
And I'll do whatever you tell me to.

2436
01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:57,000
Okay, Mori.

2437
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:58,080
I'm sorry.

2438
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:02,200
But I really don't have any ulterior motives.

2439
01:33:02,860 --> 01:33:04,380
She's from the streets.

2440
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:07,320
People like you are the worst.

2441
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:08,180
What?

2442
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:10,420
God damn nice people.

2443
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:14,320
Fucking hate them.

2444
01:33:16,740 --> 01:33:18,980
Oh, she has baggage.

2445
01:33:19,980 --> 01:33:20,800
Oh, dang.

2446
01:33:21,700 --> 01:33:23,620
She has a lot of baggage.

2447
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:24,940
It's okay.

2448
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:25,680
We can fix her.

2449
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:30,140
Guys, we can fix her.

2450
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:34,000
She's like, I hate nice people.

2451
01:33:34,260 --> 01:33:36,340
It's time I bring this class to a close.

2452
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:38,620
You can fix it.

2453
01:33:38,940 --> 01:33:47,020
Guys, if you want to try fixing Mori, exclamation point Nike, and the pin link in the description, in the chat.

2454
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:49,740
And click my link, and you too can fix her.

2455
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:54,840
It helps me and the stream a lot.

2456
01:33:56,180 --> 01:33:57,800
Can you fix her though?

2457
01:34:00,420 --> 01:34:02,980
You too can also try and fix her.

2458
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:04,700
Oh my god, we did it.

2459
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:05,940
We can play Bubble March.

2460
01:34:06,260 --> 01:34:06,680
I'm curious.

2461
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:09,160
Everyone's saying Bubble March is a really cute game too.

2462
01:34:18,220 --> 01:34:27,880
Oh, it came from inside her.

2463
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:31,140
To cover this entire space would be impossible.

2464
01:34:32,260 --> 01:34:35,660
I used the bubbles I had available to create this tree.

2465
01:34:36,660 --> 01:34:38,580
Wait, she created the tree?

2466
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:42,040
The tree's made of bubbles?

2467
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:45,120
And redirects it into the bubbles.

2468
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:48,480
Which increases their surface area.

2469
01:34:49,640 --> 01:34:49,960
Wow.

2470
01:34:51,020 --> 01:34:56,220
So when you call this the bubble tree, you mean it's literally made of bubbles?

2471
01:34:58,680 --> 01:35:00,940
Oh my god, and then like...

2472
01:35:00,940 --> 01:35:02,140
Oh wait, they can change...

2473
01:35:02,140 --> 01:35:03,680
We can pop the tree!

2474
01:35:04,140 --> 01:35:06,180
I've never seen anything like this before.

2475
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:07,720
How extraordinary.

2476
01:35:07,740 --> 01:35:08,940
Dude, think of that Twitch Prime.

2477
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:09,460
Thank you.

2478
01:35:10,300 --> 01:35:10,960
Can I touch it just once?

2479
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:13,120
Doki-do.

2480
01:35:13,860 --> 01:35:14,320
Thanks.

2481
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:17,300
What's wrong with me?

2482
01:35:17,700 --> 01:35:20,280
I mean, a bubble is meant to be popped.

2483
01:35:21,420 --> 01:35:22,340
That's surprising.

2484
01:35:22,940 --> 01:35:25,720
I thought it would be cold since it's made out of...

2485
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:25,920
Yeah.

2486
01:35:26,220 --> 01:35:27,200
That's what I thought too.

2487
01:35:30,680 --> 01:35:31,800
That's interesting.

2488
01:35:34,220 --> 01:35:36,240
I want to check something.

2489
01:35:37,240 --> 01:35:37,860
Siren.

2490
01:35:40,380 --> 01:35:41,900
Excuse me for a moment.

2491
01:35:42,160 --> 01:35:43,680
She can just make more tree bubbles.

2492
01:35:44,380 --> 01:35:46,180
She can make another bubble tree.

2493
01:35:47,300 --> 01:35:51,840
In order to exchange senses with the tree, she activates her ability.

2494
01:35:52,180 --> 01:36:06,780
The warmth of the water travels up the trunk of the tree and reaches the massive membrane that touches the ocean, the frigid touch of ocean water, and a sensation like something is watching from beyond.

2495
01:36:06,780 --> 01:36:08,380
What's she doing?

2496
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:09,780
What's she doing?

2497
01:36:09,780 --> 01:36:10,840
Is she merging with the tree?

2498
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:13,440
No, you can't.

2499
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:15,800
If you keep going, it'll be dangerous.

2500
01:36:16,140 --> 01:36:16,640
Wait, why?

2501
01:36:17,140 --> 01:36:18,040
What do you mean?

2502
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:18,500
Yeah.

2503
01:36:21,460 --> 01:36:22,860
Huh?

2504
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:25,360
Huh?

2505
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:27,580
Huh?

2506
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:41,720
Huh?

2507
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:44,560
We'd have no way of fighting.

2508
01:36:46,650 --> 01:36:49,790
Then you would never be able to return to the surface.

2509
01:36:49,910 --> 01:36:50,930
The war monster?

2510
01:36:51,170 --> 01:36:52,250
But he's outside.

2511
01:36:52,710 --> 01:36:53,910
What is this thing you're talking about?

2512
01:36:53,930 --> 01:36:54,410
We're in him.

2513
01:36:54,790 --> 01:36:56,350
How can he come get us?

2514
01:36:56,570 --> 01:36:58,870
Something dangerous that doesn't understand language.

2515
01:37:00,270 --> 01:37:02,430
Were you hiding here from that thing too?

2516
01:37:03,410 --> 01:37:04,010
Yes.

2517
01:37:04,930 --> 01:37:08,690
I quickly realized that my ability had no effect on it.

2518
01:37:08,690 --> 01:37:13,350
He has a manifestation of himself.

2519
01:37:13,590 --> 01:37:14,810
It's like white blood cells.

2520
01:37:16,270 --> 01:37:19,030
Oh, it's his white blood cells.

2521
01:37:33,550 --> 01:37:34,470
That's right.

2522
01:37:34,890 --> 01:37:37,630
Nice people don't exist in the Nikkei world.

2523
01:37:37,630 --> 01:37:38,610
But I am curious.

2524
01:37:38,630 --> 01:37:39,590
It's not programmed.

2525
01:37:40,330 --> 01:37:44,810
We live in an area where people don't stick to an exit for others without good reason.

2526
01:37:45,690 --> 01:37:49,850
We're not used to people being kind simply for the sake of being kind.

2527
01:37:51,170 --> 01:37:54,570
So, you can understand why I'm somewhat intrigued.

2528
01:37:55,570 --> 01:37:58,910
Why are you going so far out of your way to help us?

2529
01:37:59,670 --> 01:38:03,090
Why are you not more wary of us, a bunch of strangers?

2530
01:38:03,090 --> 01:38:03,190
Why are you not scared of us, a bunch of strangers?

2531
01:38:04,210 --> 01:38:04,790
Who are you waiting for?

2532
01:38:04,790 --> 01:38:05,290
Maybe you Maybe you're not confident.

2533
01:38:05,290 --> 01:38:07,570
Maybe you're being this nice because of some hidden motive.

2534
01:38:08,270 --> 01:38:09,390
Or something.

2535
01:38:13,410 --> 01:38:14,650
She doesn't understand.

2536
01:38:15,370 --> 01:38:17,510
You're arriving here felt like a divine gift.

2537
01:38:18,590 --> 01:38:20,830
I've been here on my own for so long.

2538
01:38:21,010 --> 01:38:21,970
She's so lonely.

2539
01:38:22,150 --> 01:38:23,630
She just wants to talk to people.

2540
01:38:24,110 --> 01:38:25,330
I had the chance to talk to someone again felt like a gift.

2541
01:38:26,030 --> 01:38:32,250
So I wanted to help you in any way possible and be nice to you.

2542
01:38:32,610 --> 01:38:36,310
This hasn't had communication with people in so long.

2543
01:38:37,690 --> 01:38:39,510
Here, I'll show you.

2544
01:38:40,390 --> 01:38:40,770
How?

2545
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:44,090
She has a phone on?

2546
01:38:44,230 --> 01:38:45,670
Her phone still works?

2547
01:38:46,010 --> 01:38:47,570
So much time has passed already.

2548
01:38:48,370 --> 01:38:54,310
If that date on the screen is correct, then I believe it's been about 70 years.

2549
01:38:54,310 --> 01:38:56,770
Jesus Christ, she had not talked to anybody.

2550
01:38:57,090 --> 01:38:59,250
And then Mori was like, you get lonely?

2551
01:38:59,610 --> 01:39:00,430
What a bitch.

2552
01:39:01,670 --> 01:39:03,530
Like, what the fuck?

2553
01:39:03,650 --> 01:39:05,930
No wonder you considered us a gift from above.

2554
01:39:06,770 --> 01:39:10,610
That would also explain why you've been so benevolent toward us.

2555
01:39:11,490 --> 01:39:16,250
I have to say, Sirenix, you seem like a real hard luck case.

2556
01:39:16,810 --> 01:39:18,590
Wait, so she's an older model.

2557
01:39:18,850 --> 01:39:22,250
Wait, why is the older model stronger than every other Nike?

2558
01:39:23,370 --> 01:39:25,450
You don't make them like they used to, guys.

2559
01:39:26,470 --> 01:39:27,370
It's like...

2560
01:39:28,550 --> 01:39:33,630
It's like when you have, like, the iPhone 1 is more sturdier than the newer iPhones.

2561
01:39:36,310 --> 01:39:38,650
Some day, you can tell your story.

2562
01:39:39,450 --> 01:39:40,350
All of it.

2563
01:39:41,250 --> 01:39:44,290
We've experienced our fair share of hardships, too.

2564
01:39:44,830 --> 01:39:48,810
So no matter what your story is, we'll be able to handle it.

2565
01:39:49,290 --> 01:39:51,950
Oh, they lost the tech to make these types of models?

2566
01:39:52,190 --> 01:39:52,650
Oh!

2567
01:39:53,250 --> 01:39:54,130
That's interesting.

2568
01:40:03,280 --> 01:40:04,600
That makes sense.

2569
01:40:10,430 --> 01:40:11,950
They lost, like...

2570
01:40:11,950 --> 01:40:15,030
They lost the patent to make these models, too.

2571
01:40:15,710 --> 01:40:17,790
Why do you keep coming here and pestering me?

2572
01:40:18,890 --> 01:40:19,150
Oh?

2573
01:40:20,070 --> 01:40:21,750
Don't you remember what I said?

2574
01:40:22,370 --> 01:40:24,790
I told you to drop the whole saint act.

2575
01:40:25,730 --> 01:40:28,210
Boy, stop being such a bitch!

2576
01:40:28,690 --> 01:40:31,210
You insist on coming back here again and again.

2577
01:40:31,510 --> 01:40:34,070
By the way, you can get it for free right now during the anniversary.

2578
01:40:34,590 --> 01:40:34,710
Don't laugh.

2579
01:40:35,810 --> 01:40:36,790
I'll leave soon.

2580
01:40:37,750 --> 01:40:40,690
Don't think that I'm gonna start opening up to you because of this.

2581
01:40:43,890 --> 01:40:45,170
So if you like...

2582
01:40:45,170 --> 01:40:46,950
You are real lucky, do you know that?

2583
01:40:47,090 --> 01:40:49,350
If you like a tsundere in your team right now...

2584
01:40:50,590 --> 01:40:54,850
If you wanna fix her right now, you can get her for free!

2585
01:40:55,170 --> 01:40:56,790
By using my link!

2586
01:40:56,950 --> 01:40:58,230
That's pinned in chat!

2587
01:40:58,790 --> 01:40:59,950
Good segue, Doki.

2588
01:41:00,310 --> 01:41:00,950
Good job.

2589
01:41:01,390 --> 01:41:03,230
It's like when Obama gave himself a medal.

2590
01:41:03,450 --> 01:41:04,290
That's me right now.

2591
01:41:08,350 --> 01:41:11,290
Yeah, if you do an exclamation point, Nike...

2592
01:41:12,930 --> 01:41:14,070
You can...

2593
01:41:14,070 --> 01:41:14,790
You can...

2594
01:41:14,790 --> 01:41:16,490
Click on the link below.

2595
01:41:16,710 --> 01:41:18,530
You can get up to 160 free points.

2596
01:41:18,710 --> 01:41:19,370
And...

2597
01:41:19,370 --> 01:41:19,650
Mori!

2598
01:41:19,650 --> 01:41:20,270
For free!

2599
01:41:20,670 --> 01:41:21,990
And you can fix it!

2600
01:41:26,950 --> 01:41:27,940
Emails with Somi...

2601
01:41:27,940 --> 01:41:28,300
Cool!

2602
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:35,100
She's not happy.

2603
01:41:38,530 --> 01:41:39,830
Is that...

2604
01:41:39,830 --> 01:41:41,430
What I think it is?

2605
01:41:42,090 --> 01:41:43,630
Where did you find it?

2606
01:41:44,350 --> 01:41:45,510
Near the submarine.

2607
01:41:46,170 --> 01:41:46,730
Are you hungry?

2608
01:41:47,190 --> 01:41:49,150
I can't believe you found something like that over there.

2609
01:41:49,690 --> 01:41:50,410
I...

2610
01:41:50,410 --> 01:41:52,090
I guess so.

2611
01:41:53,350 --> 01:41:54,650
Would you like to go together later?

2612
01:41:55,730 --> 01:41:56,450
I...

2613
01:41:56,450 --> 01:41:58,070
I guess so.

2614
01:41:59,350 --> 01:42:00,230
Did he just...

2615
01:42:00,230 --> 01:42:01,710
Reuse that voice line?

2616
01:42:02,450 --> 01:42:03,850
Good night, Mori!

2617
01:42:05,330 --> 01:42:05,930
Hmm...

2618
01:42:05,930 --> 01:42:07,850
Oh, it's like every day she's like...

2619
01:42:08,750 --> 01:42:10,470
Trusting people more and more.

2620
01:42:11,590 --> 01:42:12,670
Another week passes.

2621
01:42:14,650 --> 01:42:16,490
Is there anything else to look through?

2622
01:42:19,350 --> 01:42:21,730
Stop wearing suit boxes and steps outside.

2623
01:42:22,930 --> 01:42:25,790
Oh, she's like opening up herself more and more.

2624
01:42:27,830 --> 01:42:28,310
Huh?

2625
01:42:31,510 --> 01:42:35,510
Streaks of silvery liquid flow and undulate like a galaxy.

2626
01:42:36,990 --> 01:42:38,770
What's got you so mesmerized?

2627
01:42:39,010 --> 01:42:39,250
Yeah.

2628
01:42:41,110 --> 01:42:42,970
Don't sneak up on me like that.

2629
01:42:43,890 --> 01:42:44,470
Wow.

2630
01:42:45,510 --> 01:42:48,070
I've never seen ocean water that color.

2631
01:42:48,390 --> 01:42:49,250
It's like...

2632
01:42:49,250 --> 01:42:50,650
The Ouro Borealis.

2633
01:42:54,010 --> 01:42:55,130
Right here?

2634
01:42:55,450 --> 01:42:56,730
In this bubble...

2635
01:42:57,070 --> 01:42:58,550
In the bubble tree?

2636
01:43:03,070 --> 01:43:04,410
All located in...

2637
01:43:04,950 --> 01:43:06,970
Little Mermaid's bubble sphere?

2638
01:43:11,110 --> 01:43:12,470
Can't see it?

2639
01:43:12,910 --> 01:43:15,630
I'm trying to look like that's here inside your bubble.

2640
01:43:16,350 --> 01:43:17,970
Why do you look so worried?

2641
01:43:18,530 --> 01:43:20,130
Is that stuff over there bad?

2642
01:43:21,310 --> 01:43:21,830
Everyone!

2643
01:43:22,450 --> 01:43:22,850
Inside!

2644
01:43:23,950 --> 01:43:25,490
Oh no, is that...

2645
01:43:25,490 --> 01:43:27,730
Oh my god, it's the evil Ouro Borealis!

2646
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:36,100
What's that red light?

2647
01:43:36,340 --> 01:43:37,420
Yeah, what is it?

2648
01:43:41,640 --> 01:43:42,160
Raptures?

2649
01:43:42,160 --> 01:43:43,180
Raptures?

2650
01:43:46,850 --> 01:43:48,120
They're coming this way!

2651
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:51,210
Borealis Borealis!

2652
01:43:53,020 --> 01:43:55,840
Since when can raptures move underwater?

2653
01:43:56,900 --> 01:43:58,050
From what I know...

2654
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:00,000
Aurora Borealis...

2655
01:44:00,700 --> 01:44:01,740
...are incapable of that.

2656
01:44:03,340 --> 01:44:04,200
Oh...

2657
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:05,760
Siren...

2658
01:44:05,760 --> 01:44:07,600
What is this place?

2659
01:44:08,300 --> 01:44:10,160
Are we really in the ocean?

2660
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:11,160
Oh...

2661
01:44:17,340 --> 01:44:18,780
Oh no...

2662
01:44:19,160 --> 01:44:19,840
Well...

2663
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:22,220
If you guys wanna find out more...

2664
01:44:22,220 --> 01:44:24,360
Exclamation point neat game...

2665
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:26,560
And you can download the game yourself...

2666
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:29,820
To know more about the current story...

2667
01:44:29,820 --> 01:44:30,680
Cause now...

2668
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:32,800
Now is...

2669
01:44:32,940 --> 01:44:33,920
Bubble time!

2670
01:44:37,180 --> 01:44:38,140
Bubble time!

2671
01:44:38,140 --> 01:44:39,040
Time!

2672
01:44:41,280 --> 01:44:42,020
It's time!

2673
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:44,240
I can finally play the mini game!

2674
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:45,340
It makes me happy!

2675
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:47,400
Alright...

2676
01:44:47,400 --> 01:44:47,900
Cool, cool!

2677
01:44:49,540 --> 01:44:52,760
Uni looks at Mihara who is sleeping sadly under the bubble tree.

2678
01:44:54,200 --> 01:44:55,760
I wanna play the bubble game!

2679
01:44:56,760 --> 01:44:57,200
Cool!

2680
01:44:58,720 --> 01:44:59,240
Uni?

2681
01:44:59,720 --> 01:45:00,240
Cool?

2682
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:03,380
What are you doing here alone?

2683
01:45:03,580 --> 01:45:04,140
Where is Mihara?

2684
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:05,440
Oh wait, I have to read this myself now.

2685
01:45:05,440 --> 01:45:08,620
No mermaid probably spots Mihara who is fast asleep.

2686
01:45:09,420 --> 01:45:12,180
So you're on your own because Mihara is sleeping!

2687
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:14,260
Cool, cool!

2688
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:17,280
Are you feeling bored?

2689
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:19,940
Cool, cool, cool!

2690
01:45:20,980 --> 01:45:24,620
Then would you like to play a board game with me?

2691
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:25,540
Oh!

2692
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:29,200
Cool, cool, cool, cool!

2693
01:45:30,360 --> 01:45:30,900
Oh!

2694
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:34,080
Guys, I sound just like her!

2695
01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:37,500
Ape taught me how to make these!

2696
01:45:37,740 --> 01:45:41,600
Not only did they help me learn how to control the bubbles better!

2697
01:45:42,380 --> 01:45:47,160
But they are also a great way to pass the time when you're bored!

2698
01:45:48,700 --> 01:45:50,780
Would you like me to teach you?

2699
01:45:54,500 --> 01:45:55,060
Cool...

2700
01:45:55,060 --> 01:45:57,880
Uni looks down at her body, bound in restraints.

2701
01:45:57,880 --> 01:45:59,880
It's okay!

2702
01:46:00,360 --> 01:46:00,980
It's okay!

2703
01:46:01,880 --> 01:46:03,740
We can work together!

2704
01:46:04,680 --> 01:46:10,240
You tell me where to put the parts, and I'll move them for you!

2705
01:46:11,680 --> 01:46:12,080
Cool!

2706
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:17,360
Why don't you and I give it a shot then?

2707
01:46:18,760 --> 01:46:19,320
Cool!

2708
01:46:19,320 --> 01:46:19,500
Ooh!

2709
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:23,320
All right!

2710
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:24,000
Oh!

2711
01:46:30,120 --> 01:46:30,680
Oh!

2712
01:46:32,220 --> 01:46:34,480
All right, let's see what the minigame is supposed to be.

2713
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:34,740
Oh!

2714
01:46:35,140 --> 01:46:35,620
What's this?

2715
01:46:37,320 --> 01:46:37,800
Oh!

2716
01:46:39,880 --> 01:46:40,440
Bubblemar...

2717
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:41,260
Oh, wait!

2718
01:46:41,540 --> 01:46:42,420
Is this like...

2719
01:46:42,420 --> 01:46:44,200
Like, Siege type?

2720
01:46:44,460 --> 01:46:45,760
Oh, is this a Siege game?

2721
01:46:46,540 --> 01:46:49,460
Uh, created using minions and rapture advance for a destroyer...

2722
01:46:49,460 --> 01:46:49,660
Yeah!

2723
01:46:50,460 --> 01:46:52,640
Went by protecting the allies tower and destroyer...

2724
01:46:52,640 --> 01:46:54,460
Okay, wait, I know this type of game!

2725
01:46:56,840 --> 01:46:57,360
Um...

2726
01:46:57,360 --> 01:46:58,760
Start battle...

2727
01:47:00,700 --> 01:47:02,140
Yeah, it's like...

2728
01:47:02,140 --> 01:47:05,020
Summon heroes and minions to fight against...

2729
01:47:05,020 --> 01:47:05,340
Invade...

2730
01:47:06,060 --> 01:47:08,940
Yeah, it's like...

2731
01:47:08,940 --> 01:47:09,320
Cool!

2732
01:47:11,720 --> 01:47:14,560
So I have to wait, because I don't have money right now.

2733
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:16,160
Yeah, it is!

2734
01:47:16,600 --> 01:47:17,860
Okay, we'll send...

2735
01:47:20,420 --> 01:47:21,920
Can you select...

2736
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:22,540
Minions?

2737
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:23,880
Uh...

2738
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:24,380
Summon!

2739
01:47:27,160 --> 01:47:28,000
Wait...

2740
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:29,220
Wait...

2741
01:47:29,220 --> 01:47:29,860
Oh, oh, oh!

2742
01:47:30,020 --> 01:47:30,300
Guys!

2743
01:47:34,360 --> 01:47:35,200
Guys!

2744
01:47:36,500 --> 01:47:36,920
Um...

2745
01:47:38,360 --> 01:47:38,780
Um...

2746
01:47:39,200 --> 01:47:40,300
I'm tapping!

2747
01:47:40,860 --> 01:47:41,920
Oh, I have to tapping!

2748
01:47:43,880 --> 01:47:44,360
Sorry...

2749
01:47:44,760 --> 01:47:45,760
I figured it out!

2750
01:47:47,200 --> 01:47:47,900
It's okay!

2751
01:47:48,100 --> 01:47:49,620
It's okay, my tower is okay!

2752
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:51,040
I, sorry...

2753
01:47:51,640 --> 01:47:53,120
I got a little silly there...

2754
01:47:53,620 --> 01:47:55,340
I got a little silly, guys.

2755
01:47:55,640 --> 01:47:57,000
Just a little silly...

2756
01:47:58,140 --> 01:47:59,240
Just a little...

2757
01:47:59,240 --> 01:48:01,520
I got a little silly!

2758
01:48:02,180 --> 01:48:03,620
Wait, I can almost have 300!

2759
01:48:07,480 --> 01:48:09,540
Just a little silly, guys.

2760
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:11,600
Okay.

2761
01:48:13,140 --> 01:48:14,520
Alright, don't worry.

2762
01:48:16,680 --> 01:48:18,840
A big buddy is coming in.

2763
01:48:20,980 --> 01:48:22,280
We did it!

2764
01:48:23,620 --> 01:48:25,900
Oh, so it's like the siege.

2765
01:48:26,060 --> 01:48:27,320
It's basically like siege.

2766
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:29,500
Oh, wait, I can be in a union?

2767
01:48:29,900 --> 01:48:30,960
Guys, I can't jump.

2768
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:32,180
There's a union.

2769
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:33,500
Oh my god.

2770
01:48:33,620 --> 01:48:35,860
Guys, I can join a union.

2771
01:48:36,660 --> 01:48:37,260
Alright.

2772
01:48:37,620 --> 01:48:38,720
How do I join a union?

2773
01:48:39,660 --> 01:48:41,560
You're currently not in a union.

2774
01:48:41,860 --> 01:48:44,960
We can finally... Guys, we can have a union.

2775
01:48:45,220 --> 01:48:47,040
Oh, I didn't... Oh, we can research.

2776
01:48:47,200 --> 01:48:47,880
We have to research.

2777
01:48:48,140 --> 01:48:49,880
Okay, I want to upgrade gunner.

2778
01:48:50,420 --> 01:48:51,700
We should upgrade guns.

2779
01:48:52,540 --> 01:48:52,780
Alright.

2780
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:57,920
Um, and then... Oh, so there's normal difficulty.

2781
01:48:58,840 --> 01:49:01,280
It's time to unionize.

2782
01:49:01,280 --> 01:49:01,360
Guys.

2783
01:49:02,500 --> 01:49:04,460
Dude, they have tensile.

2784
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:08,460
Wait, I want to claim all of this.

2785
01:49:08,600 --> 01:49:08,720
Yeah.

2786
01:49:09,700 --> 01:49:10,000
Alright.

2787
01:49:10,360 --> 01:49:10,980
Let's do it.

2788
01:49:11,160 --> 01:49:11,940
Let's do easy two.

2789
01:49:15,160 --> 01:49:15,560
Alright.

2790
01:49:16,180 --> 01:49:19,760
Summon bubbles can be used to enhance, upgrade level... The higher the level, the more powerful.

2791
01:49:20,100 --> 01:49:20,380
Okay.

2792
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:22,380
Okay, I can upgrade now.

2793
01:49:25,260 --> 01:49:26,820
Oh, I forgot to claim them.

2794
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:27,200
No!

2795
01:49:27,540 --> 01:49:28,300
My union!

2796
01:49:30,700 --> 01:49:34,680
How am I supposed to afford... How am I supposed to start a union if I forget?

2797
01:49:36,500 --> 01:49:37,580
Oh, I can make bubbles.

2798
01:49:39,720 --> 01:49:41,480
Oh no, they have gunners now.

2799
01:49:42,760 --> 01:49:43,480
Oh... Oh...

2800
01:49:43,480 --> 01:49:44,100
Wait, don't worry.

2801
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:45,200
I have guns, too.

2802
01:49:47,500 --> 01:49:48,600
Who's... What's this?

2803
01:49:48,780 --> 01:49:50,080
Bubble Bomber Man.

2804
01:49:50,240 --> 01:49:50,480
Oh!

2805
01:49:51,140 --> 01:49:52,640
Wait, I want healers.

2806
01:49:52,820 --> 01:49:53,100
Okay.

2807
01:49:53,720 --> 01:49:54,240
Go heal.

2808
01:49:58,500 --> 01:49:59,040
Um...

2809
01:49:59,570 --> 01:50:01,360
I want to save up for a big gun.

2810
01:50:03,500 --> 01:50:04,580
Okay, big gun.

2811
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:06,800
Go in there.

2812
01:50:08,900 --> 01:50:09,460
Don't worry.

2813
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:09,600
Don't worry.

2814
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:09,960
You're healing.

2815
01:50:10,820 --> 01:50:11,420
Don't worry.

2816
01:50:11,640 --> 01:50:12,400
I'm healing you.

2817
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:13,520
Oh no, I'm...

2818
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:14,620
I'm not doing so well.

2819
01:50:16,500 --> 01:50:16,940
Um...

2820
01:50:16,940 --> 01:50:18,140
Oh, these guys...

2821
01:50:18,140 --> 01:50:19,640
These guys are a lot better.

2822
01:50:21,200 --> 01:50:21,640
Um...

2823
01:50:21,640 --> 01:50:22,140
Upgrade.

2824
01:50:23,700 --> 01:50:24,140
Um...

2825
01:50:24,140 --> 01:50:25,880
He should be a little stronger now, right?

2826
01:50:26,120 --> 01:50:26,580
It's okay.

2827
01:50:26,660 --> 01:50:27,740
I'll save up for...

2828
01:50:27,740 --> 01:50:28,360
Big boy.

2829
01:50:29,740 --> 01:50:30,620
Okay, um...

2830
01:50:30,620 --> 01:50:31,760
I'm not very good at this.

2831
01:50:31,800 --> 01:50:32,560
I just realized...

2832
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:33,260
Oh, this is bad.

2833
01:50:33,480 --> 01:50:34,420
This is...

2834
01:50:34,420 --> 01:50:35,180
Okay.

2835
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:35,980
You know what?

2836
01:50:35,980 --> 01:50:37,040
You know what's gonna help me?

2837
01:50:37,940 --> 01:50:38,800
Big boy.

2838
01:50:41,780 --> 01:50:42,560
That's fine.

2839
01:50:43,900 --> 01:50:45,200
It's big boy time.

2840
01:50:45,940 --> 01:50:47,300
He can't fail me.

2841
01:50:48,860 --> 01:50:50,280
She can't fail me.

2842
01:50:52,180 --> 01:50:53,120
Look at that.

2843
01:50:53,280 --> 01:50:53,980
Look at her go.

2844
01:50:54,140 --> 01:50:55,200
She's about to die.

2845
01:50:55,960 --> 01:50:56,000
Oh.

2846
01:50:59,580 --> 01:51:01,560
Okay, let me like...

2847
01:51:01,560 --> 01:51:01,840
Okay.

2848
01:51:02,220 --> 01:51:02,840
Here you go.

2849
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:04,500
Can't be that bad.

2850
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:05,600
Okay, I figured it out.

2851
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:06,560
I'm like...

2852
01:51:08,380 --> 01:51:12,100
I didn't think she'd die that fast, guys.

2853
01:51:13,440 --> 01:51:13,900
It's okay.

2854
01:51:14,040 --> 01:51:14,820
I figured it out.

2855
01:51:16,580 --> 01:51:17,320
Look at that.

2856
01:51:17,420 --> 01:51:17,760
There you go.

2857
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:18,180
We're winning.

2858
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:23,380
We did it.

2859
01:51:23,560 --> 01:51:23,920
We did it.

2860
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:24,580
We did it.

2861
01:51:25,400 --> 01:51:25,920
Nice.

2862
01:51:27,700 --> 01:51:28,520
See, guys?

2863
01:51:28,780 --> 01:51:29,620
I told you.

2864
01:51:29,980 --> 01:51:31,140
I told you.

2865
01:51:32,040 --> 01:51:33,140
Wait, there's a timer?

2866
01:51:33,500 --> 01:51:34,500
Oh my god.

2867
01:51:35,180 --> 01:51:35,360
Oh.

2868
01:51:36,040 --> 01:51:36,720
That's okay.

2869
01:51:36,720 --> 01:51:37,580
We can do this.

2870
01:51:37,680 --> 01:51:38,520
I believe in this.

2871
01:51:38,920 --> 01:51:40,000
Oh, this seems really fun.

2872
01:51:40,120 --> 01:51:41,240
Definitely like pretty addicting.

2873
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:43,240
I feel like...

2874
01:51:43,560 --> 01:51:45,560
I feel like this can get really, really addicting.

2875
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:46,620
I want to join...

2876
01:51:46,620 --> 01:51:47,800
I want to join a union.

2877
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:48,620
Let me in.

2878
01:51:48,740 --> 01:51:49,460
Let me in.

2879
01:51:50,320 --> 01:51:51,100
Let me in.

2880
01:51:52,780 --> 01:51:55,060
Why won't they let me unionize?

2881
01:51:59,260 --> 01:52:04,000
I think this game mode seems to be really, really fun.

2882
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:09,520
And so that people can get addicted to just this part of the game mode.

2883
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:09,860
But yeah.

2884
01:52:10,140 --> 01:52:12,060
It was nice to check it out.

2885
01:52:12,140 --> 01:52:13,800
Why don't we go check on the bubble tree?

2886
01:52:14,060 --> 01:52:15,280
Wait, can I defeat this challenge?

2887
01:52:18,580 --> 01:52:18,980
Wait.

2888
01:52:20,240 --> 01:52:20,640
Alright.

2889
01:52:20,920 --> 01:52:21,800
How strong is this?

2890
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:22,240
Are they?

2891
01:52:25,260 --> 01:52:26,360
Wait, can I use them?

2892
01:52:27,860 --> 01:52:28,700
Oh, no.

2893
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:30,240
They're fixed at level three?

2894
01:52:30,940 --> 01:52:31,460
It's okay.

2895
01:52:31,700 --> 01:52:32,640
I have her.

2896
01:52:33,860 --> 01:52:34,260
One.

2897
01:52:34,900 --> 01:52:35,300
Two.

2898
01:52:36,280 --> 01:52:36,680
Three.

2899
01:52:36,940 --> 01:52:37,060
Okay.

2900
01:52:37,200 --> 01:52:39,100
That should be like the strongest, right?

2901
01:52:40,220 --> 01:52:41,920
Alright, how do I...

2902
01:52:42,460 --> 01:52:43,460
You think I can do it?

2903
01:52:44,020 --> 01:52:45,400
I think I can do this.

2904
01:52:45,560 --> 01:52:45,820
Alright.

2905
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:50,340
I should be...

2906
01:52:50,340 --> 01:52:52,040
I would be surprised if you lose this.

2907
01:52:52,140 --> 01:52:52,920
I would be too.

2908
01:52:53,400 --> 01:52:53,540
Alright.

2909
01:52:56,220 --> 01:52:57,160
There's no way.

2910
01:52:59,320 --> 01:53:00,460
Can't be that hard.

2911
01:53:03,960 --> 01:53:04,960
Wait, that's not her.

2912
01:53:05,500 --> 01:53:05,980
Wait, okay.

2913
01:53:06,140 --> 01:53:06,460
There you go.

2914
01:53:07,320 --> 01:53:08,640
Where do I shoot, though?

2915
01:53:09,140 --> 01:53:09,700
Oh, wait.

2916
01:53:11,340 --> 01:53:11,760
See?

2917
01:53:11,960 --> 01:53:12,660
Look at that.

2918
01:53:13,040 --> 01:53:13,460
Aim.

2919
01:53:15,060 --> 01:53:16,260
Okay, now shoot the head.

2920
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:17,840
Wait, it's so easy.

2921
01:53:18,020 --> 01:53:18,900
This is not a cha...

2922
01:53:18,900 --> 01:53:19,180
Oh, wait.

2923
01:53:19,200 --> 01:53:19,820
He has more HP.

2924
01:53:20,420 --> 01:53:20,460
Wait.

2925
01:53:20,840 --> 01:53:21,260
Wait.

2926
01:53:22,240 --> 01:53:22,740
That's it.

2927
01:53:22,920 --> 01:53:23,620
It's so easy.

2928
01:53:23,720 --> 01:53:24,440
Just shoot the head.

2929
01:53:26,580 --> 01:53:27,160
Oh, shit.

2930
01:53:27,160 --> 01:53:27,580
My burst.

2931
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:31,940
I was so good that I forgot about my other abilities.

2932
01:53:31,940 --> 01:53:32,940
For class to begin.

2933
01:53:34,360 --> 01:53:38,820
Class in Wonderland!

2934
01:53:39,240 --> 01:53:40,540
Pay attention in class.

2935
01:53:40,680 --> 01:53:41,300
Jesus.

2936
01:53:46,890 --> 01:53:48,170
I did it!

2937
01:53:49,670 --> 01:53:51,270
I did it, guys.

2938
01:53:51,790 --> 01:53:52,370
Look at that.

2939
01:53:52,550 --> 01:53:52,730
See?

2940
01:53:52,890 --> 01:53:53,670
It's just that easy.

2941
01:53:54,310 --> 01:53:54,730
Look at that.

2942
01:53:55,070 --> 01:53:56,810
Clear the first stage.

2943
01:53:58,430 --> 01:54:00,250
Fastest clear of my life.

2944
01:54:01,210 --> 01:54:01,650
Alright.

2945
01:54:01,650 --> 01:54:02,570
Now we can leave.

2946
01:54:02,870 --> 01:54:04,510
This place used to be so quiet.

2947
01:54:04,950 --> 01:54:07,150
But now it's bustling with noise.

2948
01:54:07,790 --> 01:54:08,110
Yay!

2949
01:54:09,130 --> 01:54:09,930
Well, that was fun.

2950
01:54:10,070 --> 01:54:11,590
That was fun to check out...

2951
01:54:13,210 --> 01:54:13,650
Um...

2952
01:54:13,650 --> 01:54:16,750
To look through Nikkei again during all the new updates.

2953
01:54:17,090 --> 01:54:21,070
Oh, we guys had a great time looking at the new updates for the 2.5 anniversary!

2954
01:54:21,070 --> 01:54:21,270
Anniversary!

2955
01:54:21,970 --> 01:54:22,150
Guys.

2956
01:54:23,090 --> 01:54:23,490
Um...

2957
01:54:23,490 --> 01:54:24,810
As you guys know...

2958
01:54:24,810 --> 01:54:25,270
Uh...

2959
01:54:25,270 --> 01:54:26,010
We did not...

2960
01:54:26,010 --> 01:54:27,050
We didn't complete the story.

2961
01:54:27,730 --> 01:54:28,130
Uh...

2962
01:54:28,130 --> 01:54:28,590
And...

2963
01:54:28,590 --> 01:54:29,230
Wait, there's a union?

2964
01:54:29,510 --> 01:54:30,230
Wait, before...

2965
01:54:30,230 --> 01:54:31,870
Wait, actually, let me join the union real quick.

2966
01:54:32,150 --> 01:54:33,270
This is very important.

2967
01:54:35,090 --> 01:54:35,970
Where's the union?

2968
01:54:36,450 --> 01:54:36,630
Alright.

2969
01:54:37,790 --> 01:54:38,470
Wait, where is it?

2970
01:54:38,530 --> 01:54:39,150
Oh, there it is!

2971
01:54:39,890 --> 01:54:40,290
Oh!

2972
01:54:43,050 --> 01:54:44,090
We will be the...

2973
01:54:44,090 --> 01:54:45,050
Wait, can I create a union?

2974
01:54:45,310 --> 01:54:46,630
Oh my god, I can create...

2975
01:54:48,390 --> 01:54:48,790
Uh...

2976
01:54:48,790 --> 01:54:50,090
Wait, I don't have money!

2977
01:54:50,410 --> 01:54:50,810
No!

2978
01:54:51,070 --> 01:54:53,770
I don't have money to create a union!

2979
01:54:55,250 --> 01:54:56,450
Wait, we can...

2980
01:54:56,450 --> 01:54:56,910
Let's...

2981
01:54:56,910 --> 01:54:57,950
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2982
01:54:58,050 --> 01:54:58,970
There has to be...

2983
01:54:58,970 --> 01:54:59,610
Welcome back.

2984
01:55:00,050 --> 01:55:00,870
Wait a minute.

2985
01:55:01,670 --> 01:55:02,230
Maybe...

2986
01:55:02,230 --> 01:55:04,670
Maybe I'll have just enough money, guys.

2987
01:55:05,790 --> 01:55:06,350
Maybe...

2988
01:55:06,350 --> 01:55:09,570
Guys, maybe there's just enough money in here.

2989
01:55:09,810 --> 01:55:10,290
We can...

2990
01:55:10,290 --> 01:55:12,070
We can scavenge some money real quick.

2991
01:55:12,630 --> 01:55:13,190
Wait...

2992
01:55:14,450 --> 01:55:16,070
Guys, we have to create...

2993
01:55:17,150 --> 01:55:17,710
No.

2994
01:55:18,070 --> 01:55:19,530
There has to be...

2995
01:55:20,690 --> 01:55:21,570
What did I get?

2996
01:55:21,870 --> 01:55:22,470
What are these?

2997
01:55:24,110 --> 01:55:25,950
I got the... gacha tickets?

2998
01:55:26,950 --> 01:55:28,530
Oh, I can test my luck here.

2999
01:55:29,230 --> 01:55:29,570
Wait.

3000
01:55:32,370 --> 01:55:32,830
Buckley.

3001
01:55:33,970 --> 01:55:35,390
No, they're not the Mario... No.

3002
01:55:35,890 --> 01:55:36,830
They're not the Mario tickets.

3003
01:55:37,270 --> 01:55:37,670
No!

3004
01:55:39,590 --> 01:55:40,050
No!

3005
01:55:40,710 --> 01:55:42,030
There has to be something!

3006
01:55:44,770 --> 01:55:47,810
Guys, I'm just going through my couch right now trying to find any...

3007
01:55:47,810 --> 01:55:50,650
I'm going... going through my couch.

3008
01:55:50,950 --> 01:55:54,110
To see if we can find any remaining cash for us.

3009
01:55:56,190 --> 01:55:59,470
There has to be... There has to be something.

3010
01:56:01,710 --> 01:56:02,270
No.

3011
01:56:03,110 --> 01:56:05,130
There has to be gems somewhere.

3012
01:56:05,650 --> 01:56:08,050
We must have some gems somewhere.

3013
01:56:10,250 --> 01:56:13,470
Campaign Bosses 300... Guys, okay, guys, guys, guys, guys.

3014
01:56:13,610 --> 01:56:16,110
Okay, guys, we have to start a union before we go.

3015
01:56:16,110 --> 01:56:17,830
So, the union is very important.

3016
01:56:19,650 --> 01:56:22,650
Okay, before... We have to unionize before we go.

3017
01:56:23,030 --> 01:56:23,670
Wait, is the story?

3018
01:56:23,910 --> 01:56:25,250
Okay, we're almost done with the story.

3019
01:56:25,350 --> 01:56:25,950
We're almost done.

3020
01:56:27,950 --> 01:56:28,390
Alright.

3021
01:56:28,790 --> 01:56:29,410
Don't worry.

3022
01:56:30,330 --> 01:56:31,870
We can get... We can get it.

3023
01:56:33,310 --> 01:56:36,090
Alright, let's redo my team real quick, too.

3024
01:56:36,870 --> 01:56:39,130
Alright, we have to get rid of you.

3025
01:56:39,910 --> 01:56:41,110
Wait, who is my strongest?

3026
01:56:41,370 --> 01:56:41,930
I'm always ready.

3027
01:56:42,490 --> 01:56:43,670
Okay, Modernia.

3028
01:56:43,950 --> 01:56:44,070
Yes.

3029
01:56:44,630 --> 01:56:45,490
I will always protect you, Commander.

3030
01:56:47,850 --> 01:56:48,370
Um...

3031
01:56:48,370 --> 01:56:49,250
Level 4.

3032
01:56:49,510 --> 01:56:50,090
Little Mermaid.

3033
01:56:51,510 --> 01:56:52,550
Okay, one...

3034
01:56:52,550 --> 01:56:53,630
We need number two.

3035
01:56:54,210 --> 01:56:54,730
Two...

3036
01:56:55,650 --> 01:56:57,090
One, two, three.

3037
01:56:57,290 --> 01:56:57,490
Okay.

3038
01:56:59,350 --> 01:57:00,470
What do we keep?

3039
01:57:00,930 --> 01:57:02,230
I'm always ready.

3040
01:57:02,430 --> 01:57:02,690
There you go.

3041
01:57:03,350 --> 01:57:04,170
You have burst two?

3042
01:57:04,290 --> 01:57:04,950
What's burst two?

3043
01:57:08,790 --> 01:57:09,450
What do we do?

3044
01:57:09,450 --> 01:57:09,570
Privatey?

3045
01:57:09,810 --> 01:57:09,970
Here?

3046
01:57:10,470 --> 01:57:11,310
Is this better?

3047
01:57:14,270 --> 01:57:14,830
Okay.

3048
01:57:15,210 --> 01:57:15,570
That's fine.

3049
01:57:15,830 --> 01:57:16,070
Alright.

3050
01:57:16,230 --> 01:57:16,690
There you go.

3051
01:57:17,850 --> 01:57:18,430
Alright, guys.

3052
01:57:21,430 --> 01:57:22,490
Hey, Commander!

3053
01:57:22,850 --> 01:57:23,170
Skip.

3054
01:57:23,370 --> 01:57:24,270
It's all about the gems.

3055
01:57:27,170 --> 01:57:27,730
Guys.

3056
01:57:28,010 --> 01:57:28,770
We need...

3057
01:57:28,770 --> 01:57:29,290
We all...

3058
01:57:29,290 --> 01:57:30,250
We need just enough.

3059
01:57:32,530 --> 01:57:33,090
Bro!

3060
01:57:34,930 --> 01:57:36,110
You don't understand!

3061
01:57:37,630 --> 01:57:38,610
You don't...

3062
01:57:38,610 --> 01:57:39,190
Oh my god!

3063
01:57:39,350 --> 01:57:39,770
World Camp!

3064
01:57:40,110 --> 01:57:41,130
Pew pew pew pew pew!

3065
01:57:41,750 --> 01:57:42,310
Headshot!

3066
01:57:43,210 --> 01:57:43,890
Here you go.

3067
01:57:44,930 --> 01:57:45,470
It's okay.

3068
01:57:45,730 --> 01:57:47,390
Tell me the story of victory!

3069
01:57:47,670 --> 01:57:47,950
Whoa!

3070
01:57:48,790 --> 01:57:49,970
Oh, that's so cute!

3071
01:57:51,090 --> 01:57:52,270
She just won!

3072
01:57:52,530 --> 01:57:52,990
It's the...

3073
01:57:53,830 --> 01:57:54,390
Oh!

3074
01:57:56,690 --> 01:57:57,590
I like that.

3075
01:57:58,630 --> 01:57:59,610
Okay, uh...

3076
01:57:59,610 --> 01:57:59,950
Cinderella.

3077
01:58:03,710 --> 01:58:04,270
Nice.

3078
01:58:04,610 --> 01:58:05,290
Oh my god!

3079
01:58:05,550 --> 01:58:06,610
Okay, he's definitely dead.

3080
01:58:07,190 --> 01:58:08,390
Yeah, he's definitely dead.

3081
01:58:08,510 --> 01:58:09,870
Wait, he has so much HP!

3082
01:58:12,470 --> 01:58:14,370
How does he have so much HP?!

3083
01:58:15,630 --> 01:58:16,390
Okay, it's fine.

3084
01:58:17,690 --> 01:58:19,070
Jesus Christ, he has a lot.

3085
01:58:19,970 --> 01:58:20,370
Headshot.

3086
01:58:21,730 --> 01:58:22,950
How does he still...

3087
01:58:22,950 --> 01:58:23,990
He still has HP?!

3088
01:58:27,230 --> 01:58:28,210
Okay, we don't need her.

3089
01:58:30,210 --> 01:58:30,610
Alright.

3090
01:58:31,150 --> 01:58:32,050
Get him out of here!

3091
01:58:32,670 --> 01:58:34,330
Yeah, he's tanky as fuck!

3092
01:58:34,570 --> 01:58:34,890
Everyone!

3093
01:58:35,210 --> 01:58:36,810
Give him everything you've got!

3094
01:58:36,970 --> 01:58:37,450
Jesus!

3095
01:58:40,770 --> 01:58:41,810
Nice, we did it.

3096
01:58:43,390 --> 01:58:44,210
Is he dead?

3097
01:58:45,290 --> 01:58:45,550
Yay!

3098
01:58:47,890 --> 01:58:50,050
Alright, how far are we from completing this chapter?

3099
01:58:50,230 --> 01:58:50,830
How far are we?

3100
01:58:51,170 --> 01:58:51,650
Skip!

3101
01:58:52,510 --> 01:58:53,950
Wait, there's Mihara!

3102
01:58:54,130 --> 01:58:54,510
There's...

3103
01:58:54,510 --> 01:58:54,990
Guys, look!

3104
01:58:55,090 --> 01:58:55,590
There she is!

3105
01:58:55,690 --> 01:58:56,390
Look at the upgrade!

3106
01:58:58,830 --> 01:58:59,430
How far?

3107
01:58:59,870 --> 01:59:01,010
How far are we?

3108
01:59:01,010 --> 01:59:01,970
You don't want me to go there?

3109
01:59:02,090 --> 01:59:03,110
Don't keep bleeding!

3110
01:59:03,810 --> 01:59:04,850
Ha ha ha!

3111
01:59:04,870 --> 01:59:05,470
Ha ha ha!

3112
01:59:05,670 --> 01:59:05,810
Ha ha ha!

3113
01:59:05,810 --> 01:59:06,050
I'm sorry!

3114
01:59:07,330 --> 01:59:08,630
Guys, you don't...

3115
01:59:08,630 --> 01:59:08,750
Guys, you don't...

3116
01:59:08,750 --> 01:59:09,970
Guys, this is important!

3117
01:59:10,730 --> 01:59:11,250
I want...

3118
01:59:11,250 --> 01:59:14,430
Guys, if you guys wanna read the lore, you can...

3121
01:59:21,130 --> 01:59:21,650
Okay.

If you wanna know what's going on, click the link, and download the game, and you too can experience it.

3124
01:59:33,090 --> 01:59:34,450
Right now, we need to start...

3125
01:59:34,450 --> 01:59:35,930
Union is more important right now.

3126
01:59:36,670 --> 01:59:37,070
Nice.

3127
01:59:38,130 --> 01:59:39,290
The lore!

3128
01:59:39,690 --> 01:59:40,430
The lore!

3129
01:59:41,190 --> 01:59:42,290
Okay, but...

3130
01:59:42,290 --> 01:59:42,850
Unionizing.

3131
01:59:47,590 --> 01:59:48,170
Alright.

3132
01:59:49,050 --> 01:59:50,450
How far am I?

3133
01:59:50,730 --> 01:59:51,750
I literally...

3134
01:59:51,750 --> 01:59:52,630
Wait, how much...

3135
01:59:52,630 --> 01:59:54,030
Guys, how much...

3136
01:59:54,030 --> 01:59:55,270
How much...

3137
01:59:56,430 --> 01:59:58,050
How many gems do I need again?

3138
01:59:58,050 --> 01:59:59,150
Was it 500?

3139
02:00:03,060 --> 02:00:04,760
Yeah, but I wanna start my own.

3140
02:00:06,720 --> 02:00:08,200
So I can make the walls.

3141
02:00:10,740 --> 02:00:12,460
I wanna start my own union.

3142
02:00:13,820 --> 02:00:14,240
Okay, nice.

3143
02:00:15,480 --> 02:00:17,060
Okay, I definitely did not have to use this yet.

3144
02:00:18,480 --> 02:00:19,880
Uh, fuck it, I'll use it now.

3145
02:00:20,840 --> 02:00:22,060
But I wanna know what she does.

3146
02:00:23,620 --> 02:00:24,600
Oh my god, bombardment!

3147
02:00:27,340 --> 02:00:28,040
Where's the...

3148
02:00:28,040 --> 02:00:28,940
Okay, there he is.

3149
02:00:29,220 --> 02:00:30,880
I was gonna say, where is the big boy?

3150
02:00:31,700 --> 02:00:32,680
Let me clear my throat.

3151
02:00:32,720 --> 02:00:33,660
Let me kill that big boy.

3152
02:00:37,200 --> 02:00:37,900
Where did he go?

3153
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:38,500
There he is.

3154
02:00:38,640 --> 02:00:40,100
Jesus, they're so tanky.

3155
02:00:43,820 --> 02:00:44,880
I can't name it.

3156
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:45,540
Don't keep it...

3157
02:00:45,540 --> 02:00:45,880
Don't worry.

3158
02:00:45,880 --> 02:00:47,100
I'll...

3159
02:00:47,100 --> 02:00:48,660
I'll have a better name for the...

3160
02:00:48,660 --> 02:00:49,500
For my union.

3161
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:50,760
I've administered first...

3162
02:00:52,060 --> 02:00:52,680
Alright.

3163
02:00:53,100 --> 02:00:53,760
Let's see how...

3164
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:54,020
Jesus!

3165
02:00:54,300 --> 02:00:56,280
They're all blocking me from my goal!

3166
02:00:56,780 --> 02:00:58,160
It's right here!

3167
02:01:01,780 --> 02:01:03,460
They're all blocking me!

3168
02:01:03,580 --> 02:01:04,600
It's right here!

3169
02:01:07,980 --> 02:01:09,820
I need to go there!

3170
02:01:11,200 --> 02:01:11,920
I need to go there!

3171
02:01:12,620 --> 02:01:13,760
Wait, I'm just weak?

3172
02:01:13,940 --> 02:01:15,320
Don't worry, I know what to do.

3173
02:01:16,700 --> 02:01:18,740
Okay, I just gotta upgrade all of these people.

3174
02:01:21,420 --> 02:01:23,280
Okay, I won't be weak no longer.

3175
02:01:23,500 --> 02:01:24,520
Don't worry, give me a sec.

3176
02:01:25,940 --> 02:01:27,140
The moment...

3177
02:01:27,140 --> 02:01:29,220
The moment I upgrade...

3178
02:01:29,220 --> 02:01:31,560
I won't be weak no longer.

3179
02:01:33,240 --> 02:01:34,300
Okay, uh...

3180
02:01:34,300 --> 02:01:34,960
You know what, Cinderella?

3181
02:01:36,300 --> 02:01:37,380
Jesus, everything's dead.

3182
02:01:38,700 --> 02:01:39,480
I think every...

3183
02:01:39,480 --> 02:01:40,240
I think they're all dead.

3184
02:01:40,620 --> 02:01:41,320
Where is he?

3185
02:01:43,320 --> 02:01:43,920
Alright.

3186
02:01:45,800 --> 02:01:48,480
Alright, let me upgrade my Nikkei super fast.

3187
02:01:48,900 --> 02:01:51,180
So then we can finish these guys faster.

3188
02:01:51,180 --> 02:01:54,080
What a truly beautiful story this was.

3189
02:01:54,240 --> 02:01:54,580
Oh, nice!

3190
02:01:54,680 --> 02:01:55,660
Upgrading my outpost too!

3191
02:01:57,260 --> 02:01:57,820
Alright.

3192
02:01:58,540 --> 02:01:59,580
No, you don't understand.

3193
02:01:59,580 --> 02:02:00,200
This is important.

3194
02:02:00,940 --> 02:02:02,160
This is important.

3195
02:02:04,200 --> 02:02:05,780
Alright, let's see.

3196
02:02:08,200 --> 02:02:08,760
Uh...

3197
02:02:08,760 --> 02:02:10,500
Nikkei, what am I using in my squad?

3198
02:02:10,500 --> 02:02:11,460
I don't remember.

3199
02:02:12,160 --> 02:02:14,080
Okay, we need to upgrade Nava.

3200
02:02:14,540 --> 02:02:15,580
Okay, let's upgrade...

3201
02:02:15,580 --> 02:02:16,640
Actually, can I upgrade Cinderella?

3202
02:02:20,220 --> 02:02:20,740
Oh...

3203
02:02:20,740 --> 02:02:21,000
Nice!

3204
02:02:21,580 --> 02:02:22,660
Now she's stronger.

3205
02:02:23,480 --> 02:02:25,160
Okay, Cinderella's a little stronger now.

3206
02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:25,700
That's good.

3207
02:02:26,080 --> 02:02:26,680
And then...

3208
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:30,660
Okay, I can give her a little bit...

3209
02:02:31,360 --> 02:02:32,400
Level 31.

3210
02:02:33,080 --> 02:02:34,780
And then who else is in my squad?

3211
02:02:35,420 --> 02:02:36,640
Little Mermaid, Cinderella...

3212
02:02:37,160 --> 02:02:37,580
Private...

3213
02:02:37,580 --> 02:02:39,440
Okay, Nava, you gotta be a little stronger.

3214
02:02:39,960 --> 02:02:40,480
Buddy.

3215
02:02:40,940 --> 02:02:42,380
You can't be down here.

3216
02:02:44,320 --> 02:02:44,880
Okay.

3217
02:02:45,100 --> 02:02:45,120
Okay.

3218
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:46,320
Well, level 6 is something.

3219
02:02:46,600 --> 02:02:46,700
Okay.

3220
02:02:48,100 --> 02:02:50,120
Level 6 is something, okay?

3221
02:02:50,880 --> 02:02:51,440
Level...

3222
02:02:51,440 --> 02:02:52,000
Levels...

3223
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:52,880
At least it's something.

3224
02:02:53,080 --> 02:02:53,440
I...

3225
02:02:53,440 --> 02:02:54,460
I'll take this.

3226
02:02:54,620 --> 02:02:55,260
I'll take this.

3227
02:02:55,420 --> 02:02:55,560
Okay.

3228
02:02:56,560 --> 02:02:57,080
Upgrade.

3229
02:02:58,080 --> 02:02:59,220
Alright, and then...

3230
02:02:59,220 --> 02:02:59,780
Upgrade.

3231
02:03:01,300 --> 02:03:01,860
Upgrade.

3232
02:03:02,120 --> 02:03:02,540
Upgrade.

3233
02:03:02,980 --> 02:03:03,540
Upgrade.

3234
02:03:03,820 --> 02:03:04,060
Nice.

3235
02:03:04,360 --> 02:03:05,600
Now you're super...

3236
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:08,080
Now you're gonna be big and strong for me.

3237
02:03:09,200 --> 02:03:10,620
I should really...

3238
02:03:10,620 --> 02:03:11,760
Wait, can I upgrade the...

3239
02:03:11,760 --> 02:03:12,480
No, I can't.

3240
02:03:12,600 --> 02:03:13,140
Wait, can I?

3241
02:03:13,620 --> 02:03:14,660
No, they're all...

3242
02:03:14,660 --> 02:03:15,280
Fucking shit.

3243
02:03:15,440 --> 02:03:15,880
I can't.

3244
02:03:16,360 --> 02:03:16,720
Alright.

3245
02:03:17,100 --> 02:03:17,860
Who else?

3246
02:03:17,980 --> 02:03:18,820
Who else is in here?

3247
02:03:20,060 --> 02:03:20,620
Novel...

3248
02:03:20,620 --> 02:03:21,100
Private...

3249
02:03:21,100 --> 02:03:21,280
Okay.

3250
02:03:22,140 --> 02:03:22,700
Mermaid.

3251
02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:24,760
Where's Mermaid?

3252
02:03:26,100 --> 02:03:27,300
I think I have.

3253
02:03:27,580 --> 02:03:28,600
I'm pretty sure.

3254
02:03:30,060 --> 02:03:31,420
Yeah, I don't have...

3255
02:03:32,780 --> 02:03:34,140
Yeah, they're all...

3256
02:03:34,140 --> 02:03:34,640
Shit.

3257
02:03:38,280 --> 02:03:39,500
That's all I have.

3258
02:03:40,360 --> 02:03:41,040
Alright, good.

3259
02:03:41,300 --> 02:03:42,340
I think that should be enough.

3260
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:48,980
Look, we are 2k...

3261
02:03:48,980 --> 02:03:49,580
Stronger now.

3262
02:03:50,040 --> 02:03:51,200
Should I go in person?

3263
02:03:53,960 --> 02:03:55,140
We're 2k stronger.

3264
02:03:55,260 --> 02:03:56,520
It should be faster now.

3265
02:03:58,460 --> 02:03:59,260
Alright, where's she?

3266
02:04:00,040 --> 02:04:00,720
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

3267
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:02,480
Okay, now we should be a little faster.

3268
02:04:03,780 --> 02:04:04,320
Pew, pew, pew.

3269
02:04:04,960 --> 02:04:05,540
Pew, pew, pew.

3270
02:04:07,460 --> 02:04:07,980
Pew, pew.

3271
02:04:07,980 --> 02:04:08,180
Pew.

3272
02:04:09,440 --> 02:04:10,140
It's okay.

3273
02:04:10,440 --> 02:04:11,180
A little...

3274
02:04:11,180 --> 02:04:12,780
You just got hurt a little bit.

3275
02:04:13,460 --> 02:04:14,760
You're strong enough for this.

3276
02:04:14,840 --> 02:04:15,660
You don't need cover.

3277
02:04:15,780 --> 02:04:16,780
You don't need defense.

3278
02:04:17,360 --> 02:04:18,480
Just keep fighting.

3279
02:04:20,620 --> 02:04:21,320
Where are they?

3280
02:04:22,200 --> 02:04:23,480
You don't need defense.

3281
02:04:23,680 --> 02:04:24,420
Just go in there.

3282
02:04:25,780 --> 02:04:27,560
Tell me the story of victory.

3283
02:04:27,700 --> 02:04:28,020
Nice.

3284
02:04:33,250 --> 02:04:33,810
Pew, pew.

3285
02:04:33,810 --> 02:04:37,850
The story will be rewritten into a tale that's happy and beautiful.

3286
02:04:39,150 --> 02:04:40,250
Alright, get in there.

3287
02:04:40,710 --> 02:04:42,790
Oh my god, there's so many of them.

3288
02:04:42,970 --> 02:04:43,350
Please.

3289
02:04:44,790 --> 02:04:47,270
Why are there so many of them?

3290
02:04:54,830 --> 02:04:55,790
Alright, nice.

3291
02:04:56,930 --> 02:04:57,350
Okay.

3292
02:04:59,550 --> 02:05:00,770
Believe in my team.

3293
02:05:03,450 --> 02:05:04,910
Do I actually have to do anything?

3294
02:05:05,410 --> 02:05:05,830
Oh, whoa.

3295
02:05:05,970 --> 02:05:06,710
Oh, wow.

3296
02:05:07,250 --> 02:05:07,310
Wow.

3297
02:05:07,950 --> 02:05:08,190
Guys.

3298
02:05:09,550 --> 02:05:12,030
My keys per second is so fast, guys.

3299
02:05:12,150 --> 02:05:13,110
I did that all naturally.

3300
02:05:13,670 --> 02:05:13,970
I...

3301
02:05:16,910 --> 02:05:18,490
Oh my god, look at that.

3302
02:05:18,750 --> 02:05:20,670
I did that all naturally.

3303
02:05:24,230 --> 02:05:25,470
I'm playing the game.

3304
02:05:26,670 --> 02:05:29,290
Now is the time of true beauty.

3305
02:05:29,710 --> 02:05:30,290
Yippee!

3306
02:05:32,200 --> 02:05:32,490
Yep.

3307
02:05:32,930 --> 02:05:34,210
She did that all herself.

3308
02:05:37,970 --> 02:05:39,410
Guys, I don't know what you're saying.

3309
02:05:40,710 --> 02:05:41,150
Auto?

3310
02:05:41,270 --> 02:05:42,390
What does that mean?

3311
02:05:42,670 --> 02:05:44,170
That's not in my gamer vocabulary.

3312
02:05:45,490 --> 02:05:46,930
Wait, does extra stage...

3313
02:05:46,930 --> 02:05:48,550
Wait, does the extra stage have...

3314
02:05:49,320 --> 02:05:49,970
Have gems?

3315
02:05:50,150 --> 02:05:51,390
Do you have gems?

3316
02:05:52,270 --> 02:05:53,680
Do you have gems?

3317
02:05:54,260 --> 02:05:55,660
Oh my god.

3318
02:05:55,780 --> 02:05:57,080
The puzzles will show us the way.

3319
02:05:57,280 --> 02:05:57,560
Yes.

3320
02:05:57,880 --> 02:05:58,620
This is it.

3321
02:06:01,120 --> 02:06:01,960
Oh my god.

3322
02:06:02,060 --> 02:06:02,680
This is all we needed.

3323
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:04,220
This is actually all we needed.

3324
02:06:07,200 --> 02:06:08,300
We could do this.

3325
02:06:10,460 --> 02:06:12,040
This is actually all we needed.

3326
02:06:13,520 --> 02:06:14,880
We just need to kill him.

3327
02:06:19,710 --> 02:06:20,750
That's fine.

3328
02:06:22,450 --> 02:06:23,630
We don't have to...

3329
02:06:23,630 --> 02:06:24,390
We don't need cover.

3330
02:06:25,290 --> 02:06:26,850
We just need to shoot him.

3331
02:06:27,950 --> 02:06:28,350
Yeah!

3332
02:06:32,770 --> 02:06:33,670
That would be enough.

3333
02:06:33,770 --> 02:06:34,350
That's just enough.

3334
02:06:35,990 --> 02:06:36,510
Alright.

3335
02:06:37,730 --> 02:06:38,250
Alright.

3336
02:06:40,250 --> 02:06:41,230
We're good to go.

3337
02:06:41,370 --> 02:06:42,090
Now we can leave.

3338
02:06:42,810 --> 02:06:43,330
Finally.

3339
02:06:44,410 --> 02:06:46,010
There's everything we needed, guys.

3340
02:06:47,770 --> 02:06:48,290
Union.

3341
02:06:49,050 --> 02:06:51,290
Now I can create my own union.

3342
02:06:51,570 --> 02:06:51,730
Alright.

3343
02:06:51,950 --> 02:06:52,050
Wait.

3344
02:06:52,250 --> 02:06:53,430
Okay, I want a different icon.

3345
02:06:53,690 --> 02:06:54,270
Okay, nevermind.

3346
02:06:54,270 --> 02:06:55,130
Um...

3347
02:06:57,250 --> 02:06:58,870
I guess that's my icon.

3348
02:06:59,070 --> 02:06:59,210
Alright.

3349
02:06:59,930 --> 02:07:02,370
So, my name for my union...

3350
02:07:06,670 --> 02:07:07,230
Is...

3351
02:07:08,510 --> 02:07:09,430
Wait, is that...

3352
02:07:09,430 --> 02:07:10,530
It has to be eight characters, right?

3353
02:07:11,090 --> 02:07:12,230
Not Doki.

3354
02:07:12,230 --> 02:07:13,310
Oh my god.

3355
02:07:17,830 --> 02:07:19,850
It's not Doki, guys.

3356
02:07:20,070 --> 02:07:20,850
They'll never know.

3357
02:07:21,410 --> 02:07:21,930
Oh, wait, wait.

3358
02:07:23,410 --> 02:07:23,870
Actually...

3359
02:07:27,310 --> 02:07:30,750
Wait, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven...

3360
02:07:30,750 --> 02:07:31,070
No!

3361
02:07:31,690 --> 02:07:32,090
No!

3362
02:07:34,170 --> 02:07:34,190
Hahaha!

3363
02:07:35,210 --> 02:07:35,770
Hahaha!

3364
02:07:37,930 --> 02:07:38,270
Hahaha!

3365
02:07:39,110 --> 02:07:39,510
Hahaha!

3366
02:07:39,510 --> 02:07:40,930
I want this...

3367
02:07:40,930 --> 02:07:41,230
Falls!

3368
02:07:42,410 --> 02:07:42,810
Hahaha!

3369
02:07:43,770 --> 02:07:44,450
Hahaha!

3370
02:07:44,970 --> 02:07:45,070
Hahaha!

3371
02:07:45,070 --> 02:07:45,330
Okay!

3372
02:07:45,610 --> 02:07:46,030
Wait!

3373
02:07:46,290 --> 02:07:47,570
That's gonna be...

3374
02:07:47,570 --> 02:07:49,990
That's my union name!

3375
02:07:50,990 --> 02:07:51,650
Hahaha!

3376
02:07:53,630 --> 02:07:54,590
That's...

3377
02:07:56,230 --> 02:07:58,750
It's such a stupid joke.

3378
02:07:59,370 --> 02:08:02,450
It's actually infuriating.

3379
02:08:03,310 --> 02:08:04,330
Alright, there we go.

3380
02:08:04,750 --> 02:08:05,670
That's my...

3381
02:08:05,670 --> 02:08:08,770
That's gonna be my union name.

3382
02:08:09,710 --> 02:08:10,670
Um...

3383
02:08:10,670 --> 02:08:13,150
Alright, here we go.

3384
02:08:14,050 --> 02:08:14,490
No!

3385
02:08:15,190 --> 02:08:16,330
Cannot be...

3386
02:08:16,330 --> 02:08:16,730
No!

3387
02:08:16,950 --> 02:08:17,910
What's the point?

3388
02:08:18,470 --> 02:08:18,910
I...

3389
02:08:18,910 --> 02:08:20,110
What's the point?

3390
02:08:20,730 --> 02:08:22,070
Oh, I'm so sad.

3391
02:08:22,390 --> 02:08:23,790
I'm so sad.

3392
02:08:24,190 --> 02:08:26,310
I can't include...

3393
02:08:26,950 --> 02:08:28,270
Special symbols.

3394
02:08:28,830 --> 02:08:29,690
There we go.

3395
02:08:30,790 --> 02:08:31,670
Food...

3396
02:08:31,670 --> 02:08:32,530

3397
02:08:33,070 --> 02:08:33,450
Hahaha!

3398
02:08:36,150 --> 02:08:38,270
How much can I...

3399
02:08:38,270 --> 02:08:39,730
Do this for...

3400
02:08:39,730 --> 02:08:41,370
Okay, food...

3401
02:08:41,370 --> 02:08:41,630
True.

3402
02:08:41,930 --> 02:08:42,510
There we go.

3403
02:08:43,150 --> 02:08:43,710
That's my...

3404
02:08:44,330 --> 02:08:45,810
That's my union name.

3405
02:08:46,930 --> 02:08:47,550
Food True.

3406
02:08:48,770 --> 02:08:49,970
You mean...

3407
02:08:49,970 --> 02:08:50,290
Oh, yeah.

3408
02:08:50,550 --> 02:08:51,150
Food...

3409
02:08:51,150 --> 02:08:51,950
False.

3410
02:08:52,410 --> 02:08:52,950
Let's do that.

3411
02:08:53,450 --> 02:08:54,050
Food...

3412
02:08:54,050 --> 02:08:54,310
False.

3413
02:08:54,610 --> 02:08:55,050
There we go.

3414
02:08:55,730 --> 02:08:56,330
Hahaha!

3415
02:08:57,870 --> 02:08:58,030
That's...

3416
02:08:58,030 --> 02:08:58,690
That's my...

3417
02:08:58,690 --> 02:09:00,770
That's my union name, guys.

3418
02:09:02,950 --> 02:09:03,550
So...

3419
02:09:03,550 --> 02:09:04,770
We're not giving them food.

3420
02:09:05,290 --> 02:09:05,930
There we go.

3421
02:09:06,950 --> 02:09:07,910
Free my union.

3422
02:09:09,690 --> 02:09:10,490
That's right.

3423
02:09:11,310 --> 02:09:12,790
This was my long bit.

3424
02:09:12,790 --> 02:09:14,490
It all...

3425
02:09:14,490 --> 02:09:14,710
It all...

3426
02:09:14,710 --> 02:09:16,030
It's all a circle, guys.

3427
02:09:16,390 --> 02:09:17,150
It's all a circle.

3428
02:09:17,410 --> 02:09:18,990
I told you...

3429
02:09:18,990 --> 02:09:19,410

3430
02:09:19,410 --> 02:09:19,910

3431
02:09:21,670 --> 02:09:21,990
Hahahaha!

3432
02:09:21,990 --> 02:09:23,230

3433
02:09:23,230 --> 02:09:24,290

3434
02:09:24,290 --> 02:09:24,690
Alright.

3435
02:09:24,990 --> 02:09:25,910
Union settings.

3436
02:09:26,650 --> 02:09:27,510
Entry level.

3437
02:09:27,630 --> 02:09:28,730
You gotta be loveful.

3438
02:09:29,010 --> 02:09:29,250
Hahahaha!

3439
02:09:29,870 --> 02:09:30,030
Hahahaha!

3440
02:09:31,330 --> 02:09:31,750

3441
02:09:31,750 --> 02:09:32,070
Only...

3442
02:09:32,070 --> 02:09:35,470
Only the real Nikkei players can join this...

3443
02:09:35,470 --> 02:09:37,450
Can join this...

3444
02:09:38,610 --> 02:09:39,780

3445
02:09:40,450 --> 02:09:41,730

02:09:45,070 --> 02:09:45,710
Alright, guys.

3449
02:09:45,930 --> 02:09:47,050
Since I'm feeling...

3450
02:09:47,050 --> 02:09:48,070
Extra generous.

3451
02:09:48,450 --> 02:09:49,850
You can be level 95.

3452
02:09:51,180 --> 02:09:52,350
I guess...

3453
02:09:52,350 --> 02:09:55,210
I guess you can be level 55.

3454
02:09:56,910 --> 02:09:57,690
So...

3455
02:09:57,690 --> 02:09:59,830

3461
02:10:08,590 --> 02:10:09,890
Feed...

3462
02:10:09,890 --> 02:10:11,030
The Nikkes.

3463
02:10:11,670 --> 02:10:12,730
Hahahaha!

3464
02:10:13,570 --> 02:10:14,010

3472
02:10:19,090 --> 02:10:19,790

3473
02:10:19,790 --> 02:10:20,210

3475
02:10:22,050 --> 02:10:22,710

3476
02:10:22,710 --> 02:10:23,190

3478
02:10:26,210 --> 02:10:27,550

3479
02:10:27,550 --> 02:10:28,010

3480
02:10:28,010 --> 02:10:28,750
Symbols?

3481
02:10:28,970 --> 02:10:30,470
Don't feed the Nikkes.

3482
02:10:30,550 --> 02:10:30,970
There you go.

3483
02:10:32,070 --> 02:10:32,670
Union settings.

3484
02:10:32,950 --> 02:10:33,070
Save.

3485
02:10:33,330 --> 02:10:33,630
Alright.

3486
02:10:34,110 --> 02:10:34,830
Oh my god.

3487
02:10:34,850 --> 02:10:35,830
I already have so many...

3488
02:10:35,830 --> 02:10:36,570
Applications.

3489
02:10:37,350 --> 02:10:38,010
Alright.

3490
02:10:38,270 --> 02:10:38,910
Let's see.

3493
02:10:42,470 --> 02:10:44,970
To all Nikkei owners.

3494
02:10:45,810 --> 02:10:46,190
Okay.

3495
02:10:47,150 --> 02:10:47,570

There you go.

3499
02:10:51,830 --> 02:10:53,450
If you feed your Nikkei...

3500
02:10:53,930 --> 02:10:55,350
I kick you out.

3501
02:10:56,170 --> 02:10:57,310
I kick.

3502
02:10:57,450 --> 02:10:57,890

Nice.

3509
02:11:09,250 --> 02:11:10,670
I love my union.

3510
02:11:11,250 --> 02:11:14,090

3511
02:11:14,530 --> 02:11:14,890

3513
02:11:16,050 --> 02:11:16,850
I told you.

3514
02:11:17,070 --> 02:11:19,130
This is my union.

3515
02:11:19,450 --> 02:11:21,530
I get to do whatever I want.

3516
02:11:23,410 --> 02:11:24,930
Enter an announcement.

3517
02:11:26,580 --> 02:11:28,310
Drinking is not allowed either.

3518
02:11:32,610 --> 02:11:33,250
Okay.

3519
02:11:34,370 --> 02:11:34,950
Okay.

3520
02:11:35,950 --> 02:11:36,590
Wait.

3521
02:11:37,870 --> 02:11:38,270
Just...

3522
02:11:38,270 --> 02:11:39,810
Just program them...

3523
02:11:39,810 --> 02:11:40,250
Better.

3524
02:11:41,430 --> 02:11:41,990
There you go.

3525
02:11:44,150 --> 02:11:44,550
Easy.

3526
02:11:44,990 --> 02:11:45,130
Alright.

3527
02:11:45,170 --> 02:11:45,430

3528
02:11:45,430 --> 02:11:46,250
Who is in my...

3529
02:11:46,250 --> 02:11:47,090

3530
02:11:48,870 --> 02:11:49,270

3531
02:11:49,270 --> 02:11:49,650
Yeah.

3532
02:11:49,830 --> 02:11:50,830
Can I create more than one?

3533
02:11:51,910 --> 02:11:52,310
More...

3534
02:11:52,310 --> 02:11:52,990
Oh, I'm an NA.

3535
02:11:53,290 --> 02:11:54,050
Oh my god.

3536
02:11:54,090 --> 02:11:55,450
There's someone that's level 260.

3537
02:11:55,690 --> 02:11:56,290
Oh my god.

3538
02:11:56,370 --> 02:11:57,990
Level 305.

3539
02:11:58,770 --> 02:11:59,730
Oh, I have some strong...

3540
02:12:01,170 --> 02:12:01,570
369.

3541
02:12:01,770 --> 02:12:01,910
Okay.

3542
02:12:02,190 --> 02:12:02,570
Nice.

3543
02:12:02,570 --> 02:12:02,670
Nice.

3544
02:12:02,990 --> 02:12:04,010
My strongest...

3545
02:12:04,010 --> 02:12:05,030
My strongest warrior.

3546
02:12:07,330 --> 02:12:07,770
369.

3547
02:12:08,510 --> 02:12:08,950
Nice.

3548
02:12:09,330 --> 02:12:09,450
Alright.

3549
02:12:09,570 --> 02:12:09,930
That's all.

3550
02:12:10,070 --> 02:12:11,210
Can I have more than one union?

3551
02:12:11,570 --> 02:12:11,950
Okay.

3552
02:12:12,030 --> 02:12:12,750
I click their profiles.

3553
02:12:12,930 --> 02:12:13,070
Alright.

3554
02:12:13,390 --> 02:12:13,830
What...

3555
02:12:14,910 --> 02:12:15,810
Oh my god.

3556
02:12:15,830 --> 02:12:16,870
They're strong as hell.

3557
02:12:17,470 --> 02:12:19,270
No self introduction needed.

3558
02:12:19,650 --> 02:12:20,250
Yeah, I'm NA.

3559
02:12:20,410 --> 02:12:22,450
The strongest dragoon in Nikkei.

3560
02:12:22,810 --> 02:12:23,210
Oh my...

3561
02:12:23,210 --> 02:12:23,390
Wait.

3562
02:12:23,470 --> 02:12:24,250
They have Nier.

3563
02:12:25,930 --> 02:12:26,610
Can I steal her?

3564
02:12:26,850 --> 02:12:27,350
Ha ha ha.

3565
02:12:27,630 --> 02:12:27,770
Ha ha ha.

3566
02:12:27,770 --> 02:12:28,170
Steal.

3567
02:12:28,810 --> 02:12:29,290
I...

3568
02:12:29,290 --> 02:12:31,370
Did you guys leave your...

3569
02:12:31,370 --> 02:12:33,210
Did you guys leave your union for my union?

3570
02:12:33,430 --> 02:12:33,770
Good.

3571
02:12:34,430 --> 02:12:34,730
Ha ha.

3572
02:12:34,730 --> 02:12:35,410
You're canon.

3573
02:12:36,210 --> 02:12:36,770
Ha ha.

3574
02:12:38,310 --> 02:12:39,030
Oh sorry.

3575
02:12:39,090 --> 02:12:39,570
It's 2B.

3576
02:12:40,210 --> 02:12:41,930
I meant like it's from Nier.

3577
02:12:43,030 --> 02:12:44,870
I've never played Nier before guys.

3578
02:12:45,170 --> 02:12:45,750
It's 2B.

3579
02:12:46,150 --> 02:12:47,950
I just know the game is called Nier.

3580
02:12:48,670 --> 02:12:49,910
Oh my god guys.

3581
02:12:50,010 --> 02:12:52,710
Did some of you guys left your old unions to join my union?

3582
02:12:52,710 --> 02:12:53,410
Good.

3583
02:12:53,930 --> 02:12:55,150
Ha ha ha.

3584
02:12:56,130 --> 02:12:56,950
Ha ha ha.

3585
02:12:58,310 --> 02:12:58,650
Ha ha ha.

3586
02:12:59,550 --> 02:12:59,910
Alright.

3587
02:13:00,010 --> 02:13:00,230
Nice.

3588
02:13:00,570 --> 02:13:00,890
I wonder...

3589
02:13:00,890 --> 02:13:01,870
Can I have more than one union?

3590
02:13:02,070 --> 02:13:03,330
Or is it just one union?

3591
02:13:03,850 --> 02:13:05,110
Oh, it's just one.

3592
02:13:05,350 --> 02:13:05,770
That's alright.

3593
02:13:06,350 --> 02:13:06,690
What's this?

3594
02:13:06,770 --> 02:13:08,850
How do I have a stronger union guys?

3595
02:13:11,010 --> 02:13:11,790
Only one?

3596
02:13:12,110 --> 02:13:13,790
How do I have stronger unions?

3597
02:13:16,390 --> 02:13:17,250
Be active?

3598
02:13:17,550 --> 02:13:17,810
Alright.

3599
02:13:17,850 --> 02:13:18,690
I believe in you guys.

3600
02:13:20,070 --> 02:13:21,090
My male come...

3601
02:13:25,750 --> 02:13:28,850
I can send daily mail to my members.

3602
02:13:33,850 --> 02:13:34,570
Yay.

3603
02:13:35,450 --> 02:13:36,310
The mail.

3604
02:13:38,910 --> 02:13:41,810
I can actually send you guys mail.

3605
02:13:44,770 --> 02:13:45,490
Anyway.

3606
02:13:46,110 --> 02:13:46,910
Wait, wait, wait.

3607
02:13:47,110 --> 02:13:47,550
Let's see.

3608
02:14:05,070 --> 02:14:12,010
I got a couple of ones for you.

3609
02:14:12,010 --> 02:14:12,250
Why do I have this road for you?

3610
02:14:12,370 --> 02:14:13,690
I have this read to you?

3611
02:14:13,690 --> 02:14:13,730
So if you use the link...

3612
02:14:13,730 --> 02:14:13,810
Follow your link...

3613
02:14:13,810 --> 02:14:14,470

3614
02:14:14,470 --> 02:14:14,950
Number one.

3615
02:14:15,270 --> 02:14:16,490

3616
02:14:16,530 --> 02:14:17,530
I create a account, less like the link, next on channel, straight away.

3617
02:14:17,530 --> 02:14:20,310
In an hour, you'll get a new mail from your leader.

3618
02:14:22,250 --> 02:14:23,330

3619
02:14:24,310 --> 02:14:25,190

3620
02:14:27,850 --> 02:14:28,290
Anyway.

3621
02:14:28,990 --> 02:14:29,810
Anyway, guys.

3622
02:14:29,950 --> 02:14:30,770
Well, that was fun.

3623
02:14:30,950 --> 02:14:31,290
That was fun.

3624
02:14:31,410 --> 02:14:32,810
Thank you again to...

3625
02:14:32,810 --> 02:14:37,250
Thank you again to Nikkei for sponsoring me today.

3626
02:14:37,390 --> 02:14:38,230
I had a lot of fun.

3627
02:14:38,490 --> 02:14:42,950
I streamed a lot longer than my supposed times.

3628
02:14:43,090 --> 02:14:45,850
But, like, I did have a lot of fun playing the game.

3629
02:14:45,850 --> 02:14:48,830
That's why I streamed a lot longer than what I was supposed to.

3630
02:14:49,190 --> 02:14:49,790
But, yes.

3631
02:14:49,910 --> 02:14:52,490
Huge shout out to Nikkei again for sponsoring me.

3632
02:14:53,470 --> 02:14:58,030
If you guys want to check out the game yourself and want to know more about the story, more about the characters.

3633
02:14:58,230 --> 02:15:00,230
Or try to see if you can pull Little Mermaid.

3634
02:15:00,490 --> 02:15:02,850
You can click on the link if you do exclamation point Nikkei.

3635
02:15:03,890 --> 02:15:06,090
Or just click the link that's pinned in the chat.

3636
02:15:06,750 --> 02:15:07,250
But, yeah.

3637
02:15:07,330 --> 02:15:07,970
Thank you, everybody.

3638
02:15:08,430 --> 02:15:09,290
I had a great time.

3639
02:15:09,450 --> 02:15:10,690
I hope you guys had a great time as well.

3640
02:15:10,890 --> 02:15:12,550
I'm gonna call it here right now.

3641
02:15:12,670 --> 02:15:14,590
For those who are new here, my name is Doki Bird.

3642
02:15:14,590 --> 02:15:16,390
I usually stream on YouTube.

3643
02:15:16,670 --> 02:15:19,690
Today, I'm on Twitch because my sponsor was on Twitch.

3644
02:15:19,890 --> 02:15:21,110
I do have another sponsor tomorrow.

3645
02:15:21,110 --> 02:15:23,070
So, please check that out as well tomorrow.

3646
02:15:23,830 --> 02:15:25,530
And support that stream as well.

3647
02:15:25,730 --> 02:15:26,230
Anyway, guys.

3648
02:15:26,310 --> 02:15:26,970
As always, everybody.

3649
02:15:27,130 --> 02:15:27,850
Stay hydrated.

3650
02:15:28,010 --> 02:15:28,430
Pause your check.

3651
02:15:28,670 --> 02:15:30,210
Get up and move around to get that blood flow.

3652
02:15:30,330 --> 02:15:32,270
And if you step for me, head to bed.

3653
02:15:32,270 --> 02:15:33,330
Because you deserve it.

3654
02:15:33,410 --> 02:15:34,590
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

3655
02:15:34,990 --> 02:15:35,710
Bye, guys.

3656
02:15:36,210 --> 02:15:36,610
Bye!

3657
02:15:36,610 --> 02:15:36,850
Bye!
