1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,720
We're live now.

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:01,860
Professional.

3
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,180
We're so professional.

4
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,820
We go right into it.

5
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,040
It's like random.

6
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,820
It's because you're pink, Onigiri.

7
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,620
Yeah, you're orange.

8
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,660
Wait, you're orange, Snuffy.

9
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,460
Wait, you do look like Rock Lee.

10
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,640
Wait, what color am I?

11
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,080
I'm red.

12
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,060
Okay, I'll explain the rules for everybody here.

13
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,740
Welcome, ladies!

14
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,320
Okay, I have one person listening.

15
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,320
We're all having our own conversation.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,520
Okay, all right, ladies!

17
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,580
I will explain the rules for all of us in chat.

18
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,400
Okay, I'll explain the rules to you.

19
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,640
I'll explain the rules to you.

20
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,960
Okay, okay, okay.

21
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,660
All right, it's basically like Among Us, but like first person.

22
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,400
That's really it.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,360
Who's who?

24
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,100
Is it Prada?

25
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:31,540
Of course it's Prada.

26
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,960
We should just call each other by our colors.

27
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,660
Oh my god, yeah!

28
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:39,460
Yeah, if none of us have names, then we won't have any prejudice.

29
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,320
Like, free.

30
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,300
You're so tired.

31
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:44,980
Yeah, yeah.

32
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:50,520
If we all call each other by colors and not know who's who, then like we can't judge each other by past mistakes.

33
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,920
By new mistakes?

34
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,100
Yeah.

35
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:57,880
Yeah, yeah.

36
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,460
We'll judge you by the color of your suit.

37
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,400
You're pink, I'm green.

38
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,100
I forgot.

39
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,160
All right.

40
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,080
You're red.

41
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,080
You're pink.

42
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,260
Okay, you're pink, I'm red.

43
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:14,960
What color am I?

44
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,140
All right.

45
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,060
What color am I?

46
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:18,580
You're white.

47
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,000
You're white.

48
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,160
White?

49
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:20,580
Oh.

50
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,580
What does that mean?

51
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,420
What does that mean?

52
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,940
I'm rolling in his grave right now.

53
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:38,520
All right, so this is basically like Among Us and Trouble in Terrorist Town mixed together.

54
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,600
But like the thing is, if we find the traitor and we kill them off, we don't know.

55
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,840
We don't know.

56
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,260
Because the game, we still have to complete the task.

57
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,480
So like we, the innocents win by completing all the tasks.

58
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,140
And then the traitors win by killing everybody.

59
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,740
You still have to finish your job.

60
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:00,080
Yeah, you still have to finish your job because the ship is still, you know, the ship is still needs to be fixed.

61
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,720
You're actually pointing and making me feel accused.

62
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:04,880
It's you.

63
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:05,960
It's you.

64
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,300
Also, there's like weapons everywhere.

65
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,520
So like even innocent people can kill.

66
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,160
So we, like innocents can also kill people.

67
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,100
Interesting.

68
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:15,640
Yeah.

69
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,960
I love the TTT point where you actually have to kill your enemies.

70
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,860
Yeah, spell innocent backwards.

71
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,300
If you're innocent, spell innocent backwards.

72
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:26,820
Yeah.

73
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,300
You can't do that sh**.

74
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,000
Oh, that's very funny.

75
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:30,660
Yeah.

76
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,100
I use...

77
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,440
Have you trained your hands again, y'all?

78
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,100
Oh, it's F.

79
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:34,920
F F.

80
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,520
It's like, yeah.

81
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,260
Oh?

82
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,500
Oh yeah, yeah.

83
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,520
What does it tell me?

84
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,120
It says, Simon.

85
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,160
Simon says, God damn it.

86
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,320
Simon says...

87
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,700
I'll touch it until you can't anymore.

88
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,680
Give her a little lift.

89
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,320
Give it to me.

90
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,020
Give your bullet.

91
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:53,700
I did it!

92
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,500
I did it!

93
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,780
That's so dumb!

94
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,680
Okay, how do you ready up?

95
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,880
Okay, I readied up.

96
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:04,900
You press Q, you open your tablet, and then you press Q.

97
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

98
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,620
Alright, here we go.

99
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,400
We're so ready.

100
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,780
We're gonna save the world!

101
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,680
I believe in all of us.

102
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,500
I have no idea what I'm writing.

103
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:22,620
Okay.

104
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,180
Um...

105
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,240
I hope you guys will enjoy this clap.

106
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,160
Alright.

107
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,460
Alright, I'm innocent.

108
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,100
Oh yeah!

109
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,940
I can spell innocent backwards!

110
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,600
T-O...

111
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,740
Where are you?

112
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,480
Where even are my tasks?

113
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,080
I have...

114
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,100
If you press Q, you'll see where the stuff is.

115
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:57,800
Oh, okay.

116
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:58,480
It's yellow.

117
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,360
My stuff is yellow.

118
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,020
Oh, I have a gun!

119
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:09,820
Nothing!

120
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:15,980
No!

121
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,380
She's alive!

122
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,980
No, she's alive!

123
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,120
If there's a murder, they have to be dead!

124
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,680
No, I don't have a gun!

125
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:26,960
Look!

126
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:27,720
Look!

127
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,680
No gun!

128
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,320
No gun!

129
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,120
My hands are up.

130
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,000
No gun!

131
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,060
I really have my hands up!

132
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,480
I have no gun.

133
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,580
What do you mean?

134
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,660
What do you mean?

135
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,540
I need to do my task, guys.

136
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,580
I have work to do.

137
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:47,500
I...

138
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,400
You have to do your task!

139
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,660
I'm gonna do task!

140
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,000
Alright, how do I do this?

141
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,500
Oh, another gun.

142
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,200
Why do they keep giving me guns?

143
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,060
Okay.

144
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,760
Where's the task?

145
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,400
Is it this?

146
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,900
Oh, is this the camera?

147
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,700
Oh my god, I should have read the instructions.

148
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,020
Okay.

149
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,060
Oh, vents!

150
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,640
What am I supposed to do in the vents?

151
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,400
Okay.

152
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,880
There are three vents.

153
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,240
Guys, I should have watched this tutorial before I started.

154
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,360
Oh, do I just have to check the vents?

155
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,480
What am I doing?

156
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,560
There's the box.

157
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,960
Yeah, I see the vents.

158
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,860
And then...

159
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,560
Vent here.

160
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,180
Okay, weapon.

161
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,420
Oh!

162
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,020
I need to grab a screwdriver!

163
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:46,860
Okay.

164
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,700
The fuck are the screwdrivers?

165
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,900
Is that the screwdriver?

166
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,440
Where are the screwdrivers?

167
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,880
How am I supposed to do my task?

168
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,560
Does anyone have screwdrivers?

169
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,080
Wait, who killed her?

170
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,260
Wait, who killed Pink?

171
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,500
Who killed Pink?

172
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:15,960
Oh!

173
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,460
It blew up.

174
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:17,900
It blew up.

175
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:21,800
Okay.

176
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,200
Do we just trust people when they're like, oh, that dead body?

177
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,160
What the fuck?

178
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,740
Who found this dead body?

179
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,480
Who found this dead body?

180
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,700
Alright, we're just gonna leave that.

181
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,120
Yeah, she's always been dead.

182
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,320
It's just been that way.

183
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,360
Yeah, yeah, guys.

184
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,040
We're too busy.

185
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,460
We have to do our work, guys.

186
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,400
Like, we're too busy to handle the dead.

187
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,280
Okay, how do I do this?

188
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,620
Are we meant to apprehend the person who did this?

189
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,680
Or is it trial by combat?

190
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,340
I think it's just... I think we just gotta fix the ship?

191
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,200
That would do it.

192
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,940
I think... yeah, I think the ship is more important than a dead body, apparently.

193
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,820
You gotta find, like, batteries.

194
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,500
Why do you have a screwdriver?

195
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,260
Oh, thank you.

196
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:11,980
I actually needed that.

197
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,480
I actually needed that.

198
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,520
Thanks.

199
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,360
Alright, now...

200
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,760
Now I can fix the vent, guys.

201
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,140
Now I can do my job.

202
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:28,780
Wait, what?

203
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,560
They fixed it.

204
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,360
Wait, they fixed it!

205
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,100
The fuck was I supposed to fix it if they already...

206
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,860
if they already fixed it?

207
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:38,740
Okay.

208
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,220
What?

209
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:41,440
What?

210
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,180
You came from that direction, right?

211
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:44,900
Yeah.

212
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,040
Fucking...

213
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,160
Did someone die?

214
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,040
Wait, Yellow, who died?

215
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,040
Who are you with?

216
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,540
I was by myself.

217
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,660
Who died?

218
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,360
No, you weren't.

219
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,180
I threw the screwdriver at you.

220
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,220
Oh, you're the one I stole the screwdriver from?

221
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,460
I was with Rin.

222
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,020
Blue.

223
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,820
What happened to Blue?

224
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:06,160
Were you separated?

225
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,440
I don't know.

226
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,240
I don't know where she went.

227
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,600
I went to fucking fix the screwdriver.

228
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,260
Thank you.

229
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,100
I think Rin...

230
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,360
I think Rin killed Mata.

231
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,160
Wait, Rin killed... Rin killed her?

232
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,720
Yeah, I saw... I saw dead Pink back there.

233
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,980
Yeah, but she's been dead for like 20 years.

234
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,180
She died first?

235
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,440
Yeah, she died first.

236
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,060
Everybody surrounded her body.

237
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,240
Everybody surrounded her body.

238
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,260
She was the first... Don't trust anyone.

239
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,320
Don't trust any... What about you?

240
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:39,860
Even you?

241
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:40,660
Don't trust anyone.

242
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,060
Really?

243
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:42,240
Even you?

244
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:42,580
Not even me.

245
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,380
Okay.

246
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,420
Okay.

247
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,760
Let's fix the vent.

248
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,840
I'm here to fix my vent.

249
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:58,740
Alright.

250
00:09:59,100 --> 00:09:59,580
What?

251
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,240
She said don't trust anybody.

252
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:08,460
I was just doing what she told me to do.

253
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,580
How the fuck... Did we fix...

254
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,140
Where is every... Did everybody die?

255
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:14,980
Hello?

256
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:15,660
Oh, no.

257
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:15,820
Oh, no.

258
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,980
Oh, the red vent.

259
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,280
I am red.

260
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,240
Okay.

261
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,700
I don't like this.

262
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,440
It's so quiet.

263
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,780
It's so fucking quiet right now.

264
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,080
It's... I don't know.

265
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:44,260
Why is it... Why is it so quiet?

266
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,600
Guys.

267
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,940
Even...

268
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:47,780
What?

269
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:48,900
What?

270
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,860
Oh, my God.

271
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,540
Welcome.

272
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,900
What the bad guy?

273
00:10:59,320 --> 00:10:59,720
Wait.

274
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,540
She was the bad guy.

275
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,500
I don't want it.

276
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,080
Don't you go... Where is everyone?

277
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,720
After you killed someone.

278
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,340
She literally was like, Don't trust anybody.

279
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,000
Not even me.

280
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,460
It sounds like, okay.

281
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,320
And that's what you said.

282
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:17,580
And then...

283
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,560
You're fucking crazy.

284
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,440
You're like... I literally just did what she told me to do.

285
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,340
I had a shotgun.

286
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,300
I...

287
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,240
I don't know.

288
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,800
I found a shotgun at the floor.

289
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:35,980
Oh, no.

290
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:36,300
Oh, no.

291
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,620
Oh, no.

292
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,720
Oh, she's coming over.

293
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,420
She's going to shank him.

294
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,700
She's shank him.

295
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,560
You're going to stand here?

296
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,080
Oh, wait.

297
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,120
That's the last canister.

298
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,240
No, don't do it.

299
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,820
Yeah, put it in.

300
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,300
Right flick and then left flick.

301
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:50,840
Oh.

302
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:54,680
Wait.

303
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,340
There's a dead body.

304
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,320
Okay.

305
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,240
Okay.

306
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,080
Cool.

307
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,120
Oh, my God.

308
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:06,840
Oh, my God.

309
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,120
Oh, my God.

310
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,820
Oh, my God.

311
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,880
It's because you killed it innocent.

312
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:26,490
Oh, damn.

313
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:28,950
Oh, damn.

314
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,130
You're kidding, dude.

315
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,050
You're kidding, dude.

316
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:34,050
Stop.

317
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:35,730
What the fuck was that?

318
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,030
Stop.

319
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,190
Why did you not...

320
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:44,350
I literally stared into the barrel of her gun and met my maker.

321
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,050
I don't f**k.

322
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,250
Why did you do that?

323
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:50,670
It was so funny.

324
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:52,390
It was so funny.

325
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,710
I wasn't a different maker.

326
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,250
You were like, let me see.

327
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,630
Let me activate it.

328
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,930
Let me see if it's better than everyone f**king does.

329
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,850
Everybody killed each other.

330
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,250
Lime didn't even have to do anything.

331
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:13,410
I was like, how do I shoot this?

332
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:14,930
And she said, practice on me.

333
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,310
So I popped her in the head a lot.

334
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:23,550
It's okay.

335
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,470
I shot Juniper because Juniper was like, trust nobody.

336
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,750
And I was like, okay.

337
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:28,730
And then I just shot her.

338
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,610
I would have not shot you if I didn't.

339
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:41,710
Wait, wait, wait.

340
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:43,150
Where's Matara?

341
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,390
Oh yeah, right up here.

342
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,890
So she might have had an internet blooper.

343
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,630
Oh no.

344
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:50,570
Oh no.

345
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,050
Oh no.

346
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:57,130
Guys, the Roomba got her.

347
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,610
I'm gonna get you back.

348
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,930
No, no, no, no, no.

349
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:02,510
No, no, no, no, no.

350
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:03,530
I've already...

351
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:05,030
True play.

352
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:05,230
True play.

353
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,410
You hurt me?

354
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:07,130
What?

355
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,050
No way.

356
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,070
You said your battery was low.

357
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,170
Yo, Matara put a f**king hex on me.

358
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,250
What am I gonna do?

359
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,530
Make a voodoo doll.

360
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:23,770
I was trying to see if it did damage, so it went through you.

361
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,790
And I was like, oh no, I accidentally threw it.

362
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:29,210
I didn't even register that as anything.

363
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:30,350
I just thought you were stupid.

364
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:32,290
No.

365
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,290
I'm trying to...

366
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,430
Okay, that was pretty funny.

367
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:38,850
You were like, put the battery in.

368
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,270
And then Lime just threw it at you.

369
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,010
And you were just like, okay.

370
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:54,190
Should we wait for Matara or should we do one game first?

371
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,270
I don't know if...

372
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,090
Oh, she's back.

373
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,430
She's Matara's internet's back.

374
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:01,530
I did not know anything.

375
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:02,230
Me either.

376
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:05,110
Oh, that's crazy.

377
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,150
Okay, I'll invite her.

378
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:14,790
I was watching this editorial and then got killed.

379
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:18,950
Sorry, I just wanted to taste blood.

380
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,530
Was it delicious?

381
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,350
Yes, it was so good.

382
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:25,290
Amazing.

383
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,670
What the f**k was that supposed to blow up though?

384
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,170
What the f**k was that meant to do?

385
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,730
We did a shot s**t for it.

386
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:33,670
We were the first ones.

387
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:36,190
If there's any of the first ones, you can tell me to turn it off immediately.

388
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:40,290
And then we'd find the like, see what colors match.

389
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:42,170
We're playing that at Life.

390
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,010
It's, like, fully random.

391
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,610
We just have to, like, narrow it down.

392
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:45,910
Hell no.

393
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:46,870
Oh, welcome back.

394
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:47,270
We back.

395
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:48,210
Thank you.

396
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:49,370
I'm sorry, Mattia.

397
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:51,070
As a consequence of not doing it right, I'm just explaining.

398
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:51,510
I readied up.

399
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:53,990
Ah, I see.

400
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:56,110
Everybody readied up, guys.

401
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,890
Learn your task everybody.

402
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:06,990
Hey everybody!

403
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:08,290
I'll turn down the voice volume.

404
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:12,350
Where's the voice volume?

405
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,230
Sorry guys, I pressed the wrong button.

406
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,070
I pressed the wrong button!

407
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,480
I was like, where's the voice volume?

408
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,760
And then I accidentally returned the lobby.

409
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,560
Okay, okay, we're good now.

410
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,600
We're good.

411
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,800
Everybody's good.

412
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,020
Okay, radio everyone.

413
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,900
Were you the cheater?

414
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,020
Are we okay?

415
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:57,420
Alright.

416
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,600
I'm ready up.

417
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,140
Ready up, Snuffy.

418
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,240
Oh god, I'm sorry.

419
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,660
Ready up.

420
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,220
Okay.

421
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,220
Alright.

422
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,660
Okay, this time.

423
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,900
This time I didn't fuck up.

424
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,000
I wouldn't fuck up this time.

425
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:16,540
I promise.

426
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:20,620
Alright.

427
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,600
Are you a cheater?

428
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,940
Snuffy, are you a cheater?

429
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:25,560
No.

430
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,860
I gotta go clock into my nine to five.

431
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,560
You're nine to five.

432
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,440
What do I do here?

433
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,420
Okay, fence.

434
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,600
Alright, time to grab a screwdriver.

435
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,080
This is where the screwdriver is, right?

436
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,400
You guys know where the screwdrivers are?

437
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,260
They're gonna be this way.

438
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:45,800
Okay.

439
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,040
I don't trust you for once.

440
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:48,440
What?

441
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,240
You're the one that told me not to trust you.

442
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,240
Oh.

443
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,600
She has the gun.

444
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,720
Oh, is there only one?

445
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,700
Yeah, it's only one shot, one kill.

446
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,180
Okay.

447
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,580
Alright, heading to the fence.

448
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,360
Gonna do my nine to five.

449
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:04,960
Hey.

450
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,180
I love to...

451
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,720
What did you do?

452
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,040
Look at this.

453
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:17,500
Yeah?

454
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,240
Do you see it?

455
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:19,980
Look at him.

456
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:20,320
Oh.

457
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,180
Oh, my God.

458
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,620
Among us.

459
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,060
She's a killer.

460
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,220
Oh, my God.

461
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,260
She baited me.

462
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,720
But don't go near my tire.

463
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:39,780
Don't listen to her.

464
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,760
Don't listen to her.

465
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,600
She's gonna be like, look at this and then she's gonna slap you.

466
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:44,920
What?

467
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,520
Judy, Judy, come here.

468
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:47,700
Why did you do that?

469
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,400
I'm trying to fix the fence.

470
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,980
Judy, Judy, I wanna show you something suspicious.

471
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:52,800
Could you come here?

472
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,760
That's not Junie!

473
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,440
That's not Junie!

474
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,300
How dare you!

475
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,080
I can't believe it!

476
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,940
Do not trust her lies!

477
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,980
Look in front of you.

478
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,900
What does that look like?

479
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,280
I was here with you earlier!

480
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,840
I'm self-defense!

481
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,480
Self-defense!

482
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,500
I'm just a dumbass!

483
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,400
Wait!

484
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,500
Did you kill her?

485
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:24,660
No!

486
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,200
Did you?

487
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,520
Can you kill a dead body?

488
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,140
Can you kill a dead body?

489
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,900
Yeah, we gotta make sure.

490
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,760
We gotta know if she's like resting from...

491
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,800
We

492
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:48,890
gotta know if she's like resting from...

493
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:50,630
No!

494
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,030
Oh my god!

495
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:54,690
Guys!

496
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:55,450
Guys!

497
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,370
She was the killer!

498
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,250
She was the killer!

499
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,170
Amelie was the killer!

500
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:01,210
Amelie was the killer!

501
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,370
Trust me!

502
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:03,850
No!

503
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,390
You fucker!

504
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,250
You fucker!

505
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,030
You fucker!

506
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,650
And then there was one.

507
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,830
Were you the traitor?

508
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:30,110
I should have looked for this.

509
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:33,330
There was a really um...

510
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:36,110
I can't believe it!

511
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:38,090
There was a really um...

512
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:40,050
Don't you just like face the crowd?

513
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:40,410
Don't you just like face the crowd?

514
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,550
Three people and three dead bodies.

515
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,210
I was innocent!

516
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:47,750
I was innocent!

517
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:49,250
I died stabbing you!

518
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,110
I died stabbing you!

519
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,250
Yeah, you did!

520
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:53,850
I used all your energy!

521
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:56,530
I really just had to put my whole back into it.

522
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:58,890
I knew you were gonna...

523
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,830
I knew you were gonna stab your...

524
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:04,070
You were gonna exhaust yourself to death.

525
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,510
I knew you were gonna stab your...

526
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:07,130
I knew you were gonna stab your...

527
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:10,510
Yeah, if you use all your energy, you fucking collapse cause you're old!

528
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,030
You grab...

529
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:14,130
You grab...

530
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:16,290
Yeah, you had a heart attack.

531
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:20,350
I thought the death had...

532
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:20,690
I thought the death had...

533
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:20,970
Yeah...

534
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,870
I knew I didn't need to...

535
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:26,590
I knew I didn't need to stab you back.

536
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,750
I just needed you to get a heart attack.

537
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:32,430
And it worked!

538
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:34,770
But then I was left with three bodies!

539
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,490
I was left with three bodies!

540
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,650
Oh my god...

541
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:45,230
You might even win cause they need to do their task!

542
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,050
I don't think they know how!

543
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:52,250
Wait, can we do the task while we're dead?

544
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:53,530
Oh no!

545
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,890
They need to...

546
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:58,050
They need to finish the task.

547
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,010
I'd like to apologize.

548
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:00,370
Can you forgive me?

549
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,950
I apologize.

550
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:03,510
I apologize.

551
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,950
Wait, how did you kill Belle?

552
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:07,310
I stabbed her in the beginning.

553
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,630
I like, she even ran away.

554
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:12,690
I had no stamina.

555
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:18,470
I ran out of breath and then she literally killed me.

556
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:19,050
The end.

557
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:19,750
I like that.

558
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,510
What the fuck were you doing?

559
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:23,070
Running out of breath in the beginning?

560
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,910
I keep jumping.

561
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:28,390
I don't know, I just think it a lot.

562
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,590
I'm like, no, give me a chance!

563
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:36,050
And now I have no health, no stamina, and then the moment she tries to, like, kill me, I just frip and die.

564
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,710
Kara literally jumped once and then died.

565
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,130
Yeah, she did!

566
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:42,930
Oh yeah!

567
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:48,730
I wanted to make sure you were truly dead.

568
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:50,110
Yeah, you stabbed me.

569
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:52,130
You stabbed Bowden to death.

570
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,670
Like, to your own death.

571
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:57,510
I didn't want Bowden to wake up and kill us, you know?

572
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:59,290
Wow, thank you so much.

573
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:00,050
Now we're all dead.

574
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:01,690
So I guess we're not about dead.

575
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:02,750
Wait, how did you die?

576
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:03,890
The killer's already dead!

577
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:05,610
Why?

578
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:06,770
Why the fuck you killed me?

579
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,150
What do you mean the killer's already dead?

580
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:08,610
What?

581
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:09,450
Who killed you?

582
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:10,330
It's me, Tiki.

583
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:11,270
Oh!

584
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:15,570
She's on my side.

585
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:16,450
What?

586
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,090
I thought there was only one killer.

587
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,310
Wait, you think she's one of the killers or no?

588
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,090
I'm pretty sure there's one killer.

589
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,990
I think I just I think I'm just suspicious.

590
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:29,390
I think life just fucking killed you just for fun.

591
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:35,670
Because Monarch was the killer and it sounds like how did you die?

592
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:38,610
Just a little suspicious little bug.

593
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:39,750
Oh my god.

594
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:43,330
Oh, there's two killers?

595
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:44,050
Oh, there's two.

596
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,010
Okay, I'm gonna say it's a one.

597
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,970
Two is way too many.

598
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:49,590
Let's go see what's happening.

599
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:51,830
We're just gonna kill each other.

600
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,950
Who is the other one?

601
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:54,890
I don't know.

602
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:56,610
It has to be Lyme then, right?

603
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:57,770
Loaded in.

604
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:00,050
Where is everybody?

605
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,410
Oh, there they are!

606
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:02,830
Whoa!

607
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,410
What did you do?

608
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:10,890
How did you die?

609
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:12,950
This is what I get for trying to negotiate.

610
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,110
You never negotiate.

611
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:19,830
Never negotiate with traitors.

612
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:21,050
Never negotiate with traitors.

613
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:22,770
What did you do?

614
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:28,370
Well, she found the gun and then I said could you try not having found the gun?

615
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:30,970
Oh, oh, oh.

616
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,290
How is she the killer again?

617
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,450
Oh my god.

618
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:37,190
It was Monarch in her.

619
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:38,830
Oh.

620
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:39,870
Oh.

621
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:44,890
Oh my god.

622
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:46,870
I didn't play what we ever...

623
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:49,610
Every time we just went through how much fun we were having.

624
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:52,250
Oh my god, that was so cute!

625
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:54,870
I'm doing...

626
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,950
I'm making it beginner mode.

627
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:58,230
You...

628
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,410
You know what you did.

629
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,670
You know what you did for stick.

630
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:04,330
Oh my god.

631
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:06,190
The music did not begin.

632
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:07,170
Oh.

633
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:11,770
Oh my god.

634
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:14,190
Okay, where is it?

635
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,870
Wait, is the music DMCA?

636
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:20,650
I'm really sorry if it is.

637
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:21,450
I did not know.

638
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:24,910
I don't think it really matters.

639
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:25,710
Alright.

640
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:31,330
Okay, I'm gonna make it so that the task is like super easy.

641
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,390
I'm gonna make everything one.

642
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:38,750
Every single time I look at your POV, you're just doing tasks.

643
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:39,950
You're looking at your tablet.

644
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:40,870
You're doing your best.

645
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:43,670
Okay.

646
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:50,950
We need you, bro.

647
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:52,090
Alright.

648
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:54,310
Okay, I have...

649
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:55,610
Alright.

650
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:58,590
I have literally two tasks.

651
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:01,590
Alright.

652
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:08,130
Is this easier now?

653
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,210
Oh my god.

654
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:11,270
There's literally two tasks.

655
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:12,210
There's no way.

656
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,290
There's no way.

657
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:17,150
There's literally two tasks, everybody.

658
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,350
We can win.

659
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:23,190
Employees, let's go.

660
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,170
Oh my god.

661
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:29,670
I'm gonna go make pizza.

662
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:32,710
How do I make pizza?

663
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:34,410
Oh wait.

664
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:35,710
How do I get to pizza?

665
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,910
There's no way we can fuck up.

666
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:39,350
There's no way we can fuck up.

667
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,370
Where's the pizza room?

668
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,450
Oh my god, it's this way.

669
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,170
What does this mean?

670
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:47,230
Are you making pizza?

671
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:49,210
I don't know.

672
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:51,210
It's pizza sushi.

673
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:52,670
You put it in here.

674
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:54,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

675
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:57,050
We gotta look at the computer.

676
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:00,090
We gotta look at the computer.

677
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:02,490
We can't fuck it up.

678
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,410
It's literally two tasks.

679
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:06,190
If we fail this, we don't deserve to be paid.

680
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:09,150
There's no...

681
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:11,730
We can just eat the pizza ourselves and blame it on someone else.

682
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:12,170
Okay.

683
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:16,070
I think we go to the diner first.

684
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:16,810
Oh, the diner?

685
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:17,150
Okay.

686
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:19,590
It's a great icon.

687
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:20,190
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

688
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,690
I'll follow you because you're watching the tutorial.

689
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:25,110
Surely.

690
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,790
You watched it, right?

691
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:28,870
Oh yeah, uh-huh.

692
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:31,290
Okay, maybe, like, the customer?

693
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:36,070
Are you figuring it out?

694
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:37,450
Am I doing it?

695
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:38,570
I think so.

696
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,170
What is this?

697
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:40,990
It's a container.

698
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:42,430
Okay.

699
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:44,010
Do we have rice?

700
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:47,170
Where do we get rice?

701
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:48,350
Okay, let's see.

702
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:49,410
Alright, we go here.

703
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:50,870
Press the button?

704
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:52,430
Nope.

705
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:55,350
You need the container.

706
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,330
Oh, you put the container.

707
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,270
Wait.

708
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:00,910
You have the container?

709
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:06,910
Maybe we go grab rice from the garden?

710
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,470
Isn't nature beautiful?

711
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:13,870
And then we get it.

712
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,930
You have the container, right?

713
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:17,510
Yeah, yeah.

714
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:18,410
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

715
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:19,890
Isn't this rice?

716
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:20,690
The blue flower?

717
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,110
Is this rice?

718
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:25,770
It's blue.

719
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:28,890
Blue equals rice?

720
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:29,430
I put it in here.

721
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:30,050
I put it in.

722
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:31,290
Oh, I knew it!

723
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,250
Blue equals rice!

724
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,570
I don't know.

725
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:38,350
I think I just heard gunshots.

726
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:39,210
Did you hear that?

727
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:40,610
No.

728
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:42,990
Was that not just gunshots?

729
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:46,210
If we can't complete...

730
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:47,270
Maybe...

731
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:49,490
Maybe we need one task.

732
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:52,410
Hello?

733
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:55,670
Are you safe?

734
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:56,930
Are you guys safe?

735
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:00,930
We're just trying to get rice!

736
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,690
We're just trying!

737
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:04,730
There's only one traitor.

738
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,550
There's only one traitor.

739
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:08,550
Were you guys together?

740
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:09,090
Yeah.

741
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:09,650
Yeah.

742
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:10,790
We were trying to figure this out.

743
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,650
I think it was Mata then.

744
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:14,410
She spotted us across the room.

745
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:15,450
Okay.

746
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:16,190
Okay.

747
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:16,710
Then...

748
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:18,130
Whoa!

749
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:18,970
Whoa!

750
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:23,830
You can't just walk up to somebody unarmed!

751
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,530
I got somebody vouching for me.

752
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:27,190
You dropped this.

753
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:27,690
Here you go.

754
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:28,130
Oh, wait.

755
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:28,730
Who vouches?

756
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:30,170
It's my rice.

757
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:30,630
Okay.

758
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:30,850
Yeah.

759
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:31,390
That's our rice.

760
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:32,430
We're trying to figure out...

761
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,690
The dissidents are shooting each other.

762
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:35,330
Okay.

763
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:36,930
There's only one traitor.

764
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,870
I only put one traitor this time.

765
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:41,050
The person who shot at us...

766
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,650
This is all I heard.

767
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:44,950
Cackling after shooting both of us.

768
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:46,610
I thought it was Rin, but I'm not sure.

769
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:47,270
It looked dark blue.

770
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,890
And then all I heard was...

771
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:50,190
Well, it has to be Rin.

772
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:52,810
I'm not sure.

773
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:55,630
The end result is that we're colorblind.

774
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:57,510
I genuinely thought it was Doki.

775
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:00,570
It's not me!

776
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:01,830
I was making rice!

777
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:07,030
Did we figure it out?

778
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:08,690
Is that it?

779
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:11,470
Oh my god.

780
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:12,270
You're a genius.

781
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:14,350
I don't think that was rice.

782
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:16,310
I still don't know how to do a repeat thing.

783
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,410
Am I supposed to make rice?

784
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,810
That's what we're trying to figure out too!

785
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:25,810
We're trying to make pizza!

786
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,390
Oh wait!

787
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:29,470
We have to go back to green!

788
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,210
We're so stupid!

789
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:31,550
I just looked at the video!

790
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,610
I thought you were looking at the video!

791
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:34,590
Go to green!

792
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:36,910
Why were you looking at the video?

793
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:39,530
Look!

794
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:41,470
This is the instructions!

795
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:45,410
I think I killed the killer.

796
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:46,630
Who was the killer?

797
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:48,410
I think Rin was the killer.

798
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:51,810
We got to do this in three minutes!

799
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,850
We have to work together in three minutes!

800
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:55,850
Is this right?

801
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:57,510
Rin shot me and then she said that.

802
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:58,070
Where's the rice?

803
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:00,250
Okay, so we need these two.

804
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:03,070
We have BO4.

805
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:05,010
And then...

806
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:05,950
Process.

807
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:08,010
Oh!

808
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:09,270
We're doing it!

809
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:10,450
We're doing it!

810
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,150
Oh my god!

811
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:13,290
No guys!

812
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,990
We all have to work together!

813
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:16,670
Guys!

814
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:21,870
And then...

815
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:23,610
And then...

816
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:24,750
What do we do?

817
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:26,690
Oh!

818
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,170
And then we check it!

819
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:29,150
I'm hurting!

820
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:29,930
I'm hurting!

821
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:34,010
Do we do it?

822
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:35,250
We have to do this!

823
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:35,430
Oh!

824
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:36,750
Here!

825
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:38,490
Here!

826
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:39,130
And then...

827
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:40,890
And then that is this!

828
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:41,830
Oh!

829
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:45,130
Can we do it?

830
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,770
What happened to it?

831
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:49,470
What happened?

832
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:51,990
Where did it go?

833
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:53,990
Where did it go?

834
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:56,570
Where did it go?

835
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,050
Where did it go?

836
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:00,570
Where did it go?

837
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:01,210
Do we do it?

838
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:03,710
I don't have the analysis.

839
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:05,770
Can we fuck it up?

840
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:07,950
Bro, it's cooked.

841
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:11,410
I don't want to kill anybody!

842
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,870
Look at the ingredient wall.

843
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:14,990
The ingredient wall.

844
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:15,450
Okay.

845
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:17,470
Guys!

846
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:18,170
Please!

847
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:19,330
We have two minutes!

848
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:21,430
We have to finish two tasks, guys!

849
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,030
We gotta work together!

850
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,650
There's a dispenser!

851
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,710
We gotta...

852
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:30,550
There's a dispenser!

853
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,730
There's a dispenser?

854
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:38,970
Let me grab the stuff first!

855
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:42,310
We're so...

856
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,450
Guys!

857
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,530
We're running out of time!

858
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:46,650
We're running out of time!

859
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:48,410
How did we fuck this up?

860
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:55,350
Two tasks is too many!

861
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:58,450
Two tasks is too many!

862
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:01,650
Oh my god!

863
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:04,390
How did we not get two tasks correctly?

864
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:06,730
I don't understand!

865
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:09,410
Oh my god.

866
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:10,350
How do...

867
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:13,130
How do I get this...

868
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:18,150
I don't know how did she put stores in her container.

869
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:22,350
It's so weird.

870
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:25,750
Oh my god.

871
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:27,570
Oh it's dirty!

872
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:32,230
We just need an empty container.

873
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:34,750
We need to clean this.

874
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:36,590
We need to clean this container.

875
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:38,570
We have to clean it.

876
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:41,850
I don't think we are going to do this in 30 seconds.

877
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:46,030
We have 30 seconds.

878
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:47,370
The tool room.

879
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:48,790
The tool room.

880
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:49,490
Okay.

881
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:51,370
We can clean it in here.

882
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:51,950
Okay.

883
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,090
Alright.

884
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:57,270
Guys we are going to win.

885
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:59,250
We are going to do it.

886
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,640
I'm going to put one task.

887
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,460
I'm going to put one task.

888
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,920
No, we can't figure it out.

889
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:19,740
You can't figure it out.

890
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,680
You can do all of the aspects for us.

891
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,680
We never actually pull it.

892
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,080
You're literally white right sitting here.

893
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,640
You can't pull it.

894
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,920
My hands are wet.

895
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:32,500
My hands hurt.

896
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,460
You country agree.

897
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,700
You stole like 20 years.

898
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:38,380
I don't believe you bought.

899
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,480
Wait, did you all throw this way?

900
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:50,900
Were you the traitor?

901
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,040
How did you get caught?

902
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,540
I'm not fair anyone!

903
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,660
Just shoot somebody!

904
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:09,760
Okay, there's only one task!

905
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,340
What the fuck we got?

906
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,300
There's only one task everybody!

907
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:21,800
The real day in the op.

908
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,600
Guys!

909
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,820
How can we?

910
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,400
How?

911
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,900
There's only one task!

912
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,460
There's no way!

913
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,140
There's only one!

914
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,520
Okay.

915
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,840
There's no way!

916
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:32,880
Okay!

917
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:38,560
This is the one that I thought we had to do in the analogy.

918
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,880
Oh, it is!

919
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:43,380
So now we do the thing that we weren't doing.

920
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:43,900
Yeah!

921
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,180
Yeah!

922
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,520
We can do this!

923
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:49,480
Why is everybody walking the di- Wait, we're walking the wrong direction.

924
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:50,660
No, that's us!

925
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,020
That's us!

926
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:55,640
That's us!

927
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,580
Oh my god!

928
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,980
Alright guys, these are the ingredients on the wall!

929
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,720
These are the ingredients!

930
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,040
I need a blue cup one!

931
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,640
Okay, do I have- do I have a container?

932
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,500
Where are the containers?

933
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:15,720
This video is far too long and my attention span wasn't built, but I didn't need you to shut the room behind me a lot.

934
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,700
Bro, Pal and I have been trying to figure this out for like eight minutes.

935
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,720
We were doing the wrong task!

936
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:24,480
We were doing the wrong one!

937
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,660
How the fuck did we do this to ourselves?

938
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,200
This is so stupid.

939
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:32,760
Oh my god.

940
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:32,800
Okay guys.

941
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,020
Okay.

942
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:35,780
Alright.

943
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,300
Do you remember what the heck it needed?

944
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,600
Like, I don't know.

945
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,560
I'm just gonna grab something.

946
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,980
I'm pretty sure there's a mushroom.

947
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,320
I got a mushroom.

948
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,000
Alright.

949
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,800
I have a mushroom.

950
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:50,780
Do we need a mushroom?

951
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,440
I knew it.

952
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,220
Okay.

953
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,920
I have a mushroom.

954
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,640
We can do this!

955
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,940
We can do one task!

956
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,380
And then we put it here.

957
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

958
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,440
We put it in analysis.

959
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:12,020
Yes, we're doing it guys!

960
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:13,880
We're doing it!

961
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,300
We're actually...

962
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,460
Kool-aid.

963
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,700
And then put it here.

964
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:20,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

965
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,620
I'm gonna watch this.

966
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:22,680
I'm gonna watch this.

967
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,500
Ready to analysis?

968
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,060
Oh my god.

969
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,940
Did we do it?

970
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,140
We did it!

971
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,120
We won!

972
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,300
We did it!

973
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:41,740
We did it!

974
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,960
We finished one task!

975
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,020
We did it!

976
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,380
We did it.

977
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,020
We did it.

978
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,320
I literally found the code and went, alright, it's time.

979
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,520
And then the game ended.

980
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:00,180
We had to learn how to do one...

981
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:00,180
alright.

982
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:00,940
Okay.

983
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:08,480
Guys, okay, I'm gonna up the difficulty now, after we've leveled up from one task.

984
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:14,080
We can do now more than one!

985
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,960
We're gonna do three tasks!

986
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:19,200
We're gonna do three tasks, everybody!

987
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,660
I hope three is enough!

988
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,740
No, three is not enough!

989
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:33,460
Okay, alright, alright, everybody!

990
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:36,140
I believe in you guys!

991
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,540
Alright, I'm gonna do a scanner!

992
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,940
Alright, how do you use a scanner?

993
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,640
We go to a scanner...

994
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,760
Yeah.

995
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:55,920
Alright, I'm gonna walk while going there.

996
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:02,660
I'm gonna do a scanner.

997
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,040
Okay.

998
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:09,680
Yeah!

999
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,860
I'm gonna go in!

1000
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,540
Alright.

1001
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,500
Yeah.

1002
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:19,640
Yeah!

1003
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,220
Yeah.

1004
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,160
We have to position you?

1005
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,120
Oh!

1006
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,400
Oh!

1007
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:28,880
Okay.

1008
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,060
I got it.

1009
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,880
Everybody knows I'm very good at directions.

1010
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,260
...

1011
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,380
Alright.

1012
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:40,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1013
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:41,420
Oh!

1014
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,540
Oh, and then look a little low.

1015
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:46,260
Alright.

1016
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:48,140
Go back up a little.

1017
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,740
A little upper.

1018
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,180
Up.

1019
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:50,980
Up.

1020
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:56,990
Oh, look left.

1021
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:57,610
Look left.

1022
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:58,330
You just have to look.

1023
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,150
Left a little.

1024
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:01,750
A little lower.

1025
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:03,570
Oh, I hear it.

1026
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:04,490
Oh, oh.

1027
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:05,850
Yeah.

1028
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:07,690
Did I do it?

1029
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:08,110
Did I do it?

1030
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:09,510
Yeah, you did it.

1031
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:10,650
Okay, next one.

1032
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:11,830
Do it three more times.

1033
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:13,170
Lower.

1034
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:13,670
Lower.

1035
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:14,330
Lower.

1036
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,850
If there's two of us, can you do it with multiple people?

1037
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:19,450
Can you imagine how confusing that would get?

1038
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:20,390
Stay there.

1039
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:20,650
Stay there.

1040
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,670
We did it!

1041
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:24,490
Hard right.

1042
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:24,990
Hard right.

1043
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:26,270
Yeah, okay.

1044
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:26,770
Right there.

1045
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:27,230
Go lower.

1046
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:30,130
Oh, look at me go.

1047
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:30,970
Lower.

1048
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:31,610
Oh, perfect.

1049
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:31,650
Wow.

1050
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:36,480
What's up?

1051
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,180
What's up?

1052
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:41,620
What you up to?

1053
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:42,460
Killing people?

1054
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:43,460
You up to killing people?

1055
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,040
No.

1056
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,440
No.

1057
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,120
No.

1058
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,320
And a little bit right.

1059
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,640
And a little bit right.

1060
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,740
Yeah, you did it!

1061
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:52,280
Yeah!

1062
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,420
Am I done?

1063
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,180
Yeah, you're done.

1064
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,420
Yeah, we did it!

1065
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,500
We just need analysis!

1066
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,960
Oh my god, we're figuring it out!

1067
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,360
We're doing it!

1068
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,080
You did it!

1069
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:11,220
Oh my god, easiest game of my life.

1070
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,020
It was so good.

1071
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:16,300
Oh my god, the traitor can't do nothing now.

1072
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,240
What is she gonna do?

1073
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,320
Kill us?

1074
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,480
Oh, we need a container.

1075
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,940
Can I have you guys come with me?

1076
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,440
I want to show you something really important.

1077
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:26,700
Sure.

1078
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,160
That sounds like something a traitor will do.

1079
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,100
But I like danger.

1080
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:37,560
Yeah.

1081
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:44,000
Have you ever looked up at the sky and wondered is the moon real?

1082
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,160
It's not all the time.

1083
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,140
That's not the moon.

1084
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:47,740
That's Saturn.

1085
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,440
What?

1086
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:53,080
Oh, you're right.

1087
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:53,760
Saturn?

1088
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,980
Did someone just try and throw a knife at us and we feel at it?

1089
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:57,160
Look.

1090
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,200
We did that.

1091
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,440
What's with the knife here?

1092
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:01,140
What's happening?

1093
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,040
Oh my god.

1094
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,640
This is clearly Neptune.

1095
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:08,580
What?

1096
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:09,220
What?

1097
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:18,490
What happened?

1098
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:19,170
What happened?

1099
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:20,710
What happened?

1100
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:23,270
Wait.

1101
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:24,750
I thought...

1102
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:29,370
It's all good.

1103
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:32,050
Dude, I'm such a sucker.

1104
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:37,050
It's a shootout.

1105
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:38,730
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1106
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:40,330
I'm not the killer.

1107
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:41,130
I'm not the killer.

1108
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:41,250
I'm not the killer.

1109
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:42,390
I'm not the killer.

1110
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:51,090
I'm not the killer.

1111
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:51,990
And then...

1112
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:54,590
Let me pick it up and then press E so it's safe in your pocket.

1113
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:55,410
Hi.

1114
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:59,250
But which one of you is the imposter from Among Us?

1115
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:06,610
Also the imposter from Among Us.

1116
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:07,270
Wait.

1117
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:09,010
Wait.

1118
00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:11,590
Is somebody still alive?

1119
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:14,490
Who's still alive?

1120
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:17,870
Who's still alive?

1121
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:20,730
Oh my god.

1122
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:22,230
Life is still alive.

1123
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:25,050
Life's just trying to do her task.

1124
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:26,530
She's just...

1125
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:33,130
How dare she do this to my face.

1126
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:34,790
Oh my god.

1127
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:38,190
Life's still alive and she's just trying to do tasks.

1128
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:41,750
Oh my god.

1129
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:45,010
Killstreak.

1130
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:47,290
Who gave Batara a knife?

1131
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:48,010
Oh, I did.

1132
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:49,330
I gave her the knife.

1133
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:52,870
Guys, I think it was my fault.

1134
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:55,570
I threw a knife at Batara and set everything up.

1135
00:43:57,870 --> 00:43:59,310
I gave her...

1136
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:02,550
I accidentally gave her the knife, guys.

1137
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:03,310
I...

1138
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:06,450
You died?

1139
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:07,750
How did you die?

1140
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:14,570
I thought I was the last one left and I didn't know how to do tasks so I just died.

1141
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:16,590
Life is still alive.

1142
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:18,230
I know.

1143
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:21,570
I wanted you guys to look at the moon.

1144
00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:22,290
I'm feeling philosophical.

1145
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:26,590
Oh my god.

1146
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:31,050
All that did was put us in the same place with our backs to the door.

1147
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:32,890
You're crazy.

1148
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:35,950
Oh my god.

1149
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:37,450
I'm gonna clutch this.

1150
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:40,670
Has she even done any of the tasks?

1151
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:42,810
She still needs to do three.

1152
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:44,010
We have one task.

1153
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:46,610
Oh my god.

1154
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:47,370
That's the task.

1155
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:48,950
Where is she?

1156
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:53,010
Does Lime even know how to do it?

1157
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:58,850
Where did she go?

1158
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:01,490
Where did Lime go?

1159
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:05,190
We're missing someone.

1160
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:06,510
She's still alive.

1161
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,590
Lime, she's literally the last one.

1162
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:11,130
She's over there.

1163
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:14,250
She's not even doing tasks.

1164
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:18,290
I think she's trying to hide from you, Matara.

1165
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:19,350
She doesn't know you're dead.

1166
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:22,030
She doesn't know you're dead.

1167
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:27,890
Yeah, three analysis.

1168
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:28,310
Okay.

1169
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:32,570
Maybe I should have given us two tasks.

1170
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:35,350
Maybe three was a little too much.

1171
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:37,390
Maybe four was too much.

1172
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:38,350
Maybe four was too much.

1173
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:40,390
What the fuck?

1174
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:42,550
She doesn't know.

1175
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:45,650
She doesn't know.

1176
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:45,850
She doesn't know.

1177
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:48,630
I have to analyze the task for 27 seconds.

1178
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:49,870
That doesn't seem likely, huh?

1179
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:52,190
Lime, no!

1180
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:54,650
No!

1181
00:45:56,830 --> 00:45:58,350
Because everyone is dead.

1182
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:00,970
How was Rinda's question that she never knew we asked?

1183
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:02,750
Okay, so I needed...

1184
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:03,430
Oh god.

1185
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:05,710
I don't remember what the plants looked like.

1186
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:07,950
You can look at the window, Lime!

1187
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:09,650
Look at the window!

1188
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:11,030
Okay, okay.

1189
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:11,450
Sure.

1190
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:13,490
Lime!

1191
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:15,690
Alright, thank you, DC.

1192
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:16,890
What?

1193
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:17,950
She's still in it.

1194
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:18,950
What?

1195
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:22,030
No!

1196
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:28,530
How did we lose?

1197
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:31,110
How did we lose?

1198
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:32,330
How did we lose?

1199
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:33,870
We had four tasks!

1200
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:35,710
We had four tasks!

1201
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:36,090
What the fuck?

1202
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:36,870
Did you die?

1203
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:40,330
You were gone and we couldn't see your ghost.

1204
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:41,870
Did you try to kill me?

1205
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:43,790
Did you do anything?

1206
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:44,630
Yeah.

1207
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:48,330
But Tara thought she was the last one alive.

1208
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:49,730
And then she killed herself.

1209
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:52,570
Did you shoot me in the back?

1210
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:54,330
Oh my god.

1211
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:56,010
I wasn't expecting to see you any minute.

1212
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:57,590
We'll never...

1213
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:00,290
We'll never be able to...

1214
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:02,070
We'll never be able to win.

1215
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:04,070
No, no, no, no, no.

1216
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:07,550
We'll never be able to win, guys.

1217
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:12,530
We'll never be able to win, guys.

1218
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:13,490
We're gonna get to our backs or something.

1219
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:13,930
You're the best!

1220
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:14,890
Alright.

1221
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:21,970
I'll start...

1222
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:23,810
I'll start us off.

1223
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:24,730
I want to!

1224
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:25,410
Please!

1225
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:27,890
I just want us to win a game.

1226
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:30,030
Guys.

1227
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:31,810
Please.

1228
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:38,290
Yes we are!

1229
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:39,470
Yes we can!

1230
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:46,590
We can do it!

1231
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:49,810
Also sad guy never asked you, but hope the volume is okay now.

1232
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:51,890
That's why I went in the corner to ask you.

1233
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:54,750
All right, pressure.

1234
00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:57,530
I shall watch the video.

1235
00:47:58,070 --> 00:47:59,670
Oh, that one's too hard.

1236
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:00,650
I'm gonna do a delivery.

1237
00:48:01,350 --> 00:48:02,170
All right.

1238
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:03,930
Okay.

1239
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:06,250
We go over here.

1240
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:09,050
We go to the storage area.

1241
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:09,830
Okay.

1242
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:13,030
No, I'm not.

1243
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:13,690
I'm fucking leaving.

1244
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:17,070
I'm never trusting you again.

1245
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:22,290
Okay.

1246
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:26,830
Oh, hey, there's three boxes and there's three of us.

1247
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:28,770
Okay.

1248
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:30,330
Math-wise, this should work.

1249
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:32,990
Wait, where are the boxes?

1250
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:35,310
Oh, there's the boxes.

1251
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:36,470
Yeah, I found one.

1252
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:37,770
Okay, medical.

1253
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:39,790
Okay.

1254
00:48:39,870 --> 00:48:41,030
I found the medical boxes.

1255
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:43,850
Okay.

1256
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:45,610
What does it say after that?

1257
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:48,950
And then I put it... Oh, I just put it in here.

1258
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:49,550
Okay.

1259
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:52,810
Where's the... Where's the little box thing?

1260
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:55,690
Can't be that hard now, right?

1261
00:48:56,650 --> 00:48:58,630
But it's just nearly one task.

1262
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:01,490
You did a task?

1263
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:02,710
No.

1264
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:06,690
No, please, let me do the task.

1265
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:07,170
Please.

1266
00:49:07,590 --> 00:49:07,890
No, please, let me do the task.

1267
00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:07,890
Please.

1268
00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:08,090
Wait...

1269
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:08,870
Wait.

1270
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:09,010
Wait.

1271
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:09,110
Wait.

1272
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:09,410
Wait.

1273
00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:11,350
I'm sorry!

1274
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:12,050
I'm sorry!

1275
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:12,570
I'm sorry!

1276
00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:13,810
I'm sorry!

1277
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:20,090
I was actually the killer.

1278
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:22,770
I was actually the killer at the start.

1279
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:25,290
I didn't even know I had it at once.

1280
00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:25,970
No!

1281
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:26,970
Brynn!

1282
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:28,710
Finish my job, Brynn!

1283
00:49:28,850 --> 00:49:30,130
Finish my job!

1284
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:31,190
No!

1285
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:32,010
Brynn!

1286
00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:33,130
What are they called?

1287
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:34,270
Like, crimes of passion?

1288
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:35,050
No!

1289
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:36,690
I love you so much!

1290
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:37,010
My dad!

1291
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:42,090
I just wanted to finish my job!

1292
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:46,710
What was that millennial meme?

1293
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:48,290
Still a better love story than Twilight?

1294
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:49,330
Oh, God!

1295
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:55,270
Oh, my God!

1296
00:49:55,350 --> 00:49:56,810
Did I finish my job?

1297
00:49:57,230 --> 00:49:59,730
Did I have my one, only job?

1298
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:03,150
Ducky, if I don't get to finish, nobody gets to finish.

1299
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:05,910
That's how it works.

1300
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:07,010
Wow!

1301
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:10,590
I'm a one and done!

1302
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:16,950
They delivered something!

1303
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:21,210
Oh, my God.

1304
00:50:21,330 --> 00:50:22,610
How did Mata die?

1305
00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:24,530
She fucking stabbed me so hard.

1306
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:25,490
She got a heart attack.

1307
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:27,110
That's how she died.

1308
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:30,830
Oh, my God.

1309
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:33,670
Did I do it?

1310
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:37,010
What happened?

1311
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:39,010
What the fuck happened?

1312
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:39,990
How did you die?

1313
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:43,370
Okay.

1314
00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:44,510
That one was red.

1315
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:45,570
Okay.

1316
00:50:45,970 --> 00:50:46,610
Okay.

1317
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:50,110
Did I do it?

1318
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:51,610
Did I do it?

1319
00:50:51,610 --> 00:50:52,330
Did I do it?

1320
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:53,330
Did I do it?

1321
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:55,150
Did I do it?

1322
00:50:55,410 --> 00:50:56,590
Did I do it?

1323
00:50:56,590 --> 00:50:57,770
What happened to me?

1324
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:00,230
Did I die?

1325
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:02,130
You didn't learn from my death at all.

1326
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:03,770
I died in vain.

1327
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:04,170
Sorry.

1328
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:07,670
Did they quit?

1329
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:09,950
Did they even finish it?

1330
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:10,910
They just quit.

1331
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:13,650
I was dying all green.

1332
00:51:14,370 --> 00:51:16,790
It was fine for the first time.

1333
00:51:17,230 --> 00:51:19,830
And it had swollen the first time.

1334
00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:22,150
Did not check up?

1335
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:23,250
Why did...

1336
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:23,250
Oh, no!

1337
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:24,590
It was green!

1338
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:25,810
Someone switched them!

1339
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:26,930
Someone?!

1340
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:30,790
Oh, yes!

1341
00:51:34,410 --> 00:51:35,090
Wait,

1342
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:41,710
was it Bao that rearranged it?

1343
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:46,210
I don't know if it's a safe mission.

1344
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:47,050
Oh!

1345
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:50,150
Come here, baby!

1346
00:51:50,910 --> 00:51:52,890
Oh, it's not where... Oh, no!

1347
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:53,970
Oh, okay, they're fine.

1348
00:51:54,130 --> 00:51:54,970
It's just...

1349
00:51:56,590 --> 00:51:58,590
Okay, they're just missing one.

1350
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:06,990
No, no, it's because she didn't stand next to it!

1351
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:09,410
You don't stand there!

1352
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:14,230
Oh, okay, so... Okay, so that's not right.

1353
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:18,870
Is she...

1354
00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:22,050
It's literally everybody else dead.

1355
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:24,130
I think... Wait, is it?

1356
00:52:24,490 --> 00:52:27,730
One, two, three, four, five.

1357
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:29,390
There's still two people missing.

1358
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:32,410
Um, I'll take this.

1359
00:52:32,730 --> 00:52:33,170
Okay?

1360
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:34,390
And then...

1361
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:35,570
Can I try this again?

1362
00:52:35,970 --> 00:52:37,470
Since I know that one was...

1363
00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:38,330
Howard.

1364
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:40,470
Okay.

1365
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:41,570
Is she gonna do it?

1366
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:43,650
I'm gonna figure out this mask.

1367
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:44,890
Did I do it?

1368
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:45,470
Did she do it?

1369
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:46,390
Who told her that?

1370
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:47,350
I don't know.

1371
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:49,050
It's not exploding!

1372
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:50,610
I think she did it!

1373
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:51,190
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1374
00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:52,070
I did it, I think?

1375
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:52,670
She did it!

1376
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:54,030
Can you ban them for that?

1377
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:54,910
Wait, but I did it.

1378
00:52:55,550 --> 00:52:56,110
You did it!

1379
00:52:56,650 --> 00:52:57,010
What?

1380
00:52:58,070 --> 00:53:00,490
Oh, then she just has to put that into...

1381
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:01,310
But, but...

1382
00:53:01,310 --> 00:53:02,150
She did it!

1383
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:02,610
You did it!

1384
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:03,210
Don't do anything!

1385
00:53:03,470 --> 00:53:04,070
What are you doing?

1386
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:05,930
I'm confused now.

1387
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:08,970
Am I getting confused, or is she confused with me?

1388
00:53:09,070 --> 00:53:10,770
I'm starting to get confused now!

1389
00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:12,150
I don't understand this task at all!

1390
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:15,130
Did you watch the video?

1391
00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:16,070
Did you watch...

1392
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:17,010
What do I do?

1393
00:53:17,590 --> 00:53:18,890
You just need a new red.

1394
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:18,990
I did!

1395
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:22,290
I wish I could pick up my tablet and watch while it did.

1396
00:53:24,550 --> 00:53:24,990
Yes!

1397
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:26,510
Grab the tablet!

1398
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:27,870
Get another red.

1399
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:29,390
I believe in you, Bao.

1400
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:30,270
Pull my tablet up.

1401
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:32,390
Where's another red?

1402
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:36,990
Guys, this is why we're all VTubers.

1403
00:53:37,070 --> 00:53:38,650
We're not meant to do a 9 to 5.

1404
00:53:38,990 --> 00:53:42,290
We're not meant to do a 9 to 5.

1405
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:47,990
This is why we're VTubers.

1406
00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:50,110
Guys, we can't understand.

1407
00:53:51,070 --> 00:53:54,110
We can't understand a simple task.

1408
00:54:00,550 --> 00:54:02,410
Where's the red?

1409
00:54:03,530 --> 00:54:04,330
Who wants to learn?

1410
00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:05,750
Who wants to learn?

1411
00:54:05,830 --> 00:54:06,590
I want to learn.

1412
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:09,110
I want to learn.

1413
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:11,470
God, I love your eyebrows.

1414
00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:13,250
Oh, thank you.

1415
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:14,670
You look mischievous.

1416
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:15,550
Oh, I do?

1417
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:15,970
It's so cute.

1418
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:16,930
What?

1419
00:54:16,930 --> 00:54:19,450
You look like a mischievous potato.

1420
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:20,550
Yeah, that's me.

1421
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:24,810
We literally have, like, caterpillar eyebrows.

1422
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:30,650
You need to claim that title.

1423
00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:32,310
Oh my god.

1424
00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:35,330
Did we find... what is she doing?

1425
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:35,990
Wait, I'm kidding.

1426
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:36,730
What?

1427
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:41,790
You had it!

1428
00:54:41,870 --> 00:54:42,950
Why are you so quick?

1429
00:54:43,330 --> 00:54:44,970
This is my chat trolling.

1430
00:54:44,970 --> 00:54:45,950
Yeah, it's the same.

1431
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:46,950
She's getting us.

1432
00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:47,790
There's only eight of us.

1433
00:54:48,130 --> 00:54:48,930
Hang on, guys.

1434
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:49,690
She's got it.

1435
00:54:49,810 --> 00:54:50,450
What's this?

1436
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:55,110
I'm watching her brain expand right now.

1437
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:55,770
Live.

1438
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:57,090
Not listening.

1439
00:54:57,190 --> 00:54:58,390
My fat is being bad.

1440
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:01,390
Oh, no.

1441
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:02,890
Now we don't have time.

1442
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:04,890
Guys, it's 20 seconds.

1443
00:55:04,970 --> 00:55:05,510
Don't worry.

1444
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:06,470
Bao's got this.

1445
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:07,530
No, no, no.

1446
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:08,230
She's so exhausted.

1447
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:11,110
You guys look so, like, fed up.

1448
00:55:11,210 --> 00:55:12,230
Yeah, that's what I did.

1449
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:14,950
Okay, I'll increase the time for the next one.

1450
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:15,310
This is the task!

1451
00:55:15,590 --> 00:55:17,450
There's no... we're gonna figure this out!

1452
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:19,310
I'll increase the time!

1453
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:24,890
I'll make it like 15... oh my god!

1454
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:40,170
That's the only time!

1455
00:55:44,890 --> 00:55:47,410
Okay, I got an idea!

1456
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:49,570
Okay, guys!

1457
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:55,310
Okay, guys, I have an idea!

1458
00:55:55,610 --> 00:56:01,230
I'm gonna give us... I'm gonna give us 17 minutes on just the pressure!

1459
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:09,270
I'm gonna put 17 minutes on just pressure!

1460
00:56:12,830 --> 00:56:15,690
We're all gonna figure this out!

1461
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:18,610
We're all gonna figure it out together!

1462
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:20,630
Alright, everybody!

1463
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:23,150
It's just all of us on pressure!

1464
00:56:23,310 --> 00:56:25,470
All of us figuring it out together!

1465
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:32,210
We're all gonna figure it out together!

1466
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:35,570
Here we go!

1467
00:56:35,890 --> 00:56:38,870
As long as we're all here, we'll learn!

1468
00:56:38,870 --> 00:56:39,610
Yeah, I want to try!

1469
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:40,610
We can do this!

1470
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:43,570
We need to find all the canisters, first.

1471
00:56:44,770 --> 00:56:46,590
Okay, we gotta get all the canisters.

1472
00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:47,890
Alright!

1473
00:56:50,090 --> 00:56:51,610
I вин you in all the rub!

1474
00:56:52,330 --> 00:56:53,450
I swear she killed herself!

1475
00:56:53,470 --> 00:56:54,670
I swear to god she killed herself!

1476
00:56:54,670 --> 00:56:55,130
I swear to god she killed herself!

1477
00:56:55,290 --> 00:56:55,890
I swear to god she was like this I swear on him!

1478
00:56:55,890 --> 00:56:57,310
I did zero jump to death!

1479
00:56:57,430 --> 00:56:58,010
I believe you!

1480
00:56:58,490 --> 00:56:59,290
I swear to god, I swear on him!

1481
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:01,330
I want to see what the f*** happened!

1482
00:57:01,390 --> 00:57:02,830
There is nothing in this bar that is more believable...

1483
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:03,590
I know!

1484
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:05,230
I just wonder what the f*** is up to?

1485
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:09,450
Mmmmm mmm mmm That's what they all say.

1486
00:57:10,730 --> 00:57:12,430
That's what they all say.

1487
00:57:14,370 --> 00:57:17,630
Guys, I just want us to figure out pressure.

1488
00:57:27,350 --> 00:57:27,950
Okay.

1489
00:57:27,950 --> 00:57:30,490
How do we do this?

1490
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:36,170
I almost jumped to death again.

1491
00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:37,510
Wait.

1492
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:38,770
Let's just put it.

1493
00:57:41,490 --> 00:57:42,890
What's the worst that could happen?

1494
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:47,350
Okay.

1495
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:48,050
Just that.

1496
00:57:48,310 --> 00:57:49,150
It's just that one.

1497
00:57:52,610 --> 00:57:53,210
Okay.

1498
00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:04,570
So the worst did happen.

1499
00:58:08,310 --> 00:58:08,910
Okay.

1500
00:58:11,730 --> 00:58:13,870
So the worst did...

1501
00:58:14,610 --> 00:58:15,010
Okay.

1502
00:58:15,010 --> 00:58:15,510
Don't worry.

1503
00:58:15,570 --> 00:58:15,990
I'm here.

1504
00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:16,390
Okay.

1505
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:17,450
It's just these guys.

1506
00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:17,990
Okay.

1507
00:58:18,650 --> 00:58:19,050
Okay.

1508
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:19,390
Okay.

1509
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:19,910
Alright.

1510
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:20,870
So the worst...

1511
00:58:20,870 --> 00:58:20,990
I got you.

1512
00:58:21,150 --> 00:58:23,070
The worst did happen by the way.

1513
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:25,650
Oh my god.

1514
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:30,770
We'll figure this out.

1515
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:34,210
We're gonna figure this out together.

1516
00:58:35,510 --> 00:58:36,490
We did it.

1517
00:58:36,510 --> 00:58:36,950
We did it.

1518
00:58:36,970 --> 00:58:37,390
We did it.

1519
00:58:37,410 --> 00:58:37,810
We did it.

1520
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:38,290
We did it.

1521
00:58:38,910 --> 00:58:39,310
Nice.

1522
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:39,790
Okay.

1523
00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:40,130
Okay.

1524
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:40,430
Okay.

1525
00:58:40,430 --> 00:58:41,130
Then we put it here.

1526
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:42,390
Okay.

1527
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:42,950

Okay.

1622
00:59:09,030 --> 00:59:09,430
Okay.

1623
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:09,430
Okay.

1624
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:09,430
Okay.

1625

Okay.

1638
00:59:16,830 --> 00:59:17,670
Okay We got it!

1639
00:59:25,710 --> 00:59:27,690
But this one worked!

1640
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:29,210
I got the other one!

1641
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:40,470
That's not it.

1642
00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:40,850
It's okay.

1643
00:59:41,290 --> 00:59:42,850
They can do this.

1644
00:59:43,130 --> 00:59:44,810
I don't think that's the alarm.

1645
00:59:45,010 --> 00:59:47,170
We can figure this out.

1646
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:53,670
Because I got this one correct!

1647
00:59:53,870 --> 00:59:55,190
I got this one correct!

1648
01:00:06,430 --> 01:00:07,930
There's no way!

1649
01:00:08,110 --> 01:00:09,550
We have 13 minutes!

1650
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:12,930
There's only one!

1651
01:00:19,290 --> 01:00:20,370
Just do it!

1652
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:23,550
That's what I thought last time!

1653
01:00:23,550 --> 01:00:26,470
That one worked!

1654
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:27,410
That wasn't supposed to.

1655
01:00:27,510 --> 01:00:28,690
This one wouldn't work!

1656
01:00:30,510 --> 01:00:32,990
I thought we figured it out!

1657
01:00:33,290 --> 01:00:35,790
I thought we figured it out!

1658
01:00:36,850 --> 01:00:37,590
I thought we figured it out!

1659
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:42,590
I got her!

1660
01:00:43,150 --> 01:00:44,810
I thought we were...

1661
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:48,350
Were you trading again?

1662
01:00:49,770 --> 01:00:52,170
I just saw a gun on the ground!

1663
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:55,130
I'm just like, I got her!

1664
01:00:56,310 --> 01:00:57,810
I'm like, I'm on vacation.

1665
01:00:58,030 --> 01:01:00,010
So I'm just feeling kind of chaotic.

1666
01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:04,710
How did you die?

1667
01:01:05,890 --> 01:01:07,290
Because I heard gunshots.

1668
01:01:07,350 --> 01:01:08,990
Yeah, live shot her!

1669
01:01:09,770 --> 01:01:10,290
Yeah!

1670
01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:14,070
He's got all his gunshots and the damn pressure thing going on.

1671
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:15,210
Who is the actual killer?

1672
01:01:15,290 --> 01:01:16,770
I don't know.

1673
01:01:17,170 --> 01:01:19,090
There's so many people that died.

1674
01:01:19,370 --> 01:01:20,450
It could be.

1675
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:23,190
I think the killer just wants us to finish this job.

1676
01:01:23,690 --> 01:01:26,810
The killer just wants us to finish this one job.

1677
01:01:33,810 --> 01:01:35,550
Is there another...

1678
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:37,210
Is there another...

1679
01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:40,190
Is there another canister that we're missing?

1680
01:01:40,990 --> 01:01:43,910
There can't be another canister, right?

1681
01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:45,950
Is that it, chat?

1682
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:47,750
Like, what is going...

1683
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:49,730
How did we not figure this out?

1684
01:01:51,610 --> 01:01:53,370
There isn't, so we just...

1685
01:01:53,370 --> 01:01:54,790
It's just the order.

1686
01:01:55,490 --> 01:01:56,370
How do we...

1687
01:01:56,930 --> 01:01:58,250
Just do the order!

1688
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:03,370
Just swap the red and the yellow!

1689
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:04,170
Just swap the red and the yellow!

1690
01:02:04,170 --> 01:02:05,110
No, we're watching them.

1691
01:02:05,390 --> 01:02:08,430
Wait, why did she remove the other canister?

1692
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:10,770
We figured it out!

1693
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:13,730
Do you say that's bullshit?

1694
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:15,110
Or do you say...

1695
01:02:15,870 --> 01:02:17,910
Why don't you take it away?

1696
01:02:18,070 --> 01:02:19,170
No, look at me.

1697
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:19,590
Look at me.

1698
01:02:19,630 --> 01:02:19,710
Look at me.

1699
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:19,710
Look at me!

1700
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:27,910
I think more cigarettes are cool and I think more children should be smoking them.

1701
01:02:28,110 --> 01:02:28,670
Woah.

1702
01:02:30,030 --> 01:02:30,590
Woah.

1703
01:02:32,350 --> 01:02:34,030
You know what, Matara?

1704
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:35,230
I disagree with you.

1705
01:02:35,350 --> 01:02:37,830
Because I think children should be vaping instead.

1706
01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:48,530
Guys, for legal reasons, it's a joke.

1707
01:02:48,570 --> 01:02:49,510
For legal reasons.

1708
01:02:50,390 --> 01:02:52,150
For legal reasons, we're joking.

1709
01:02:52,150 --> 01:02:54,090
For legal reasons.

1710
01:02:54,930 --> 01:02:59,390
Please, please, I'm just fucking around because I'm dead.

1711
01:03:04,610 --> 01:03:07,730
You know how there's a candy cigarette?

1712
01:03:07,830 --> 01:03:09,430
We should have candy vapes.

1713
01:03:13,330 --> 01:03:14,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1714
01:03:15,370 --> 01:03:15,950
Yeah?

1715
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:17,530
Yeah, those are great too.

1716
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:18,690
Yeah, I had one as well.

1717
01:03:20,990 --> 01:03:23,390
How did she mess up this one?

1718
01:03:23,810 --> 01:03:25,910
How did she figure this out?

1719
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:32,050
Your deaths went to vain.

1720
01:03:32,390 --> 01:03:34,150
Your deaths never mattered.

1721
01:03:40,130 --> 01:03:41,590
Oh my god.

1722
01:03:41,670 --> 01:03:42,930
Oh my god.

1723
01:03:42,930 --> 01:03:45,330
Wait, they do have candy vapes?

1724
01:03:45,330 --> 01:03:46,390
What the fuck?

1725
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:48,250
Oh yeah.

1726
01:03:48,430 --> 01:03:50,910
Wait, how do you know about candy vapes?

1727
01:03:51,150 --> 01:03:52,890
They gotta get the yellow one.

1728
01:03:53,170 --> 01:03:54,210
Wait, which flavour?

1729
01:03:57,490 --> 01:03:58,890
No, the yellow one's the bubble gum.

1730
01:03:58,890 --> 01:03:59,370
No, the yellow one's the bubble gum.

1731
01:03:59,790 --> 01:04:00,950
No, the yellow one's the bubble gum.

1732
01:04:00,950 --> 01:04:02,150
I know where the yellow one is.

1733
01:04:02,290 --> 01:04:04,570
I know where the yellow one is.

1734
01:04:04,850 --> 01:04:05,790
It was me.

1735
01:04:05,790 --> 01:04:07,530
It was you?

1736
01:04:08,350 --> 01:04:10,510
I came to stand in front of it.

1737
01:04:11,350 --> 01:04:12,970
I killed you!

1738
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:14,330
I killed you!

1739
01:04:14,730 --> 01:04:15,830
I did it!

1740
01:04:15,970 --> 01:04:17,030
I killed the killer!

1741
01:04:17,630 --> 01:04:18,710
I did it!

1742
01:04:18,950 --> 01:04:20,690
I did my job!

1743
01:04:21,470 --> 01:04:22,390
I'm gonna win this game!

1744
01:04:22,410 --> 01:04:23,650
I'm gonna win my second game!

1745
01:04:23,790 --> 01:04:25,310
I'm gonna win my second game!

1746
01:04:26,050 --> 01:04:27,990
I'm gonna win my second game!

1747
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:30,410
They're doing this.

1748
01:04:31,030 --> 01:04:32,170
I can't...

1749
01:04:32,170 --> 01:04:34,210
It's just one task.

1750
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:35,630
It's really...

1751
01:04:36,170 --> 01:04:38,190
I should've given them 20 minutes.

1752
01:04:38,390 --> 01:04:39,730
I should go and look at the moon.

1753
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:41,490
I should just go and stare at this guy.

1754
01:04:42,190 --> 01:04:44,810
I'm fucking

1755
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:49,300
scared.

1756
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:52,080
I don't understand.

1757
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:54,520
I don't understand.

1758
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:55,580
I don't understand how...

1759
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:57,600
This game is too much for us.

1760
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:01,640
Yeah, yeah.

1761
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:02,240
It's the game.

1762
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:03,720
It's not us, guys.

1763
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:06,020
Guys, it's not us.

1764
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:06,300
It's not us.

1765
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:10,440
This game is just very difficult.

1766
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:11,800
This game...

1767
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:13,680
This video game is crazy.

1768
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:17,700
I'm afraid it's not meant to comprehend this.

1769
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:18,560
I'm afraid it's not meant to comprehend this.

1770
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:19,280
We're VTubers.

1771
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:22,380
Yeah, blame the game, not the player.

1772
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:26,200
Yeah, blame the game, not the player.

1773
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:27,380
Yeah.

1774
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:36,020
Blame the game, not the player.

1775
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:42,740
It's not my fault I can't read.

1776
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:46,320
It's the game's fault for not reading the instructions out to us.

1777
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:47,480
It's not my fault I can't read.

1778
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:47,680
It's the game's fault for not reading the instructions out to us.

1779
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:52,800
The game should have better accessibility by reading the instructions instead of having us reading it.

1780
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:53,620
The game should have better accessibility by reading the instructions instead of having us reading it.

1781
01:05:53,620 --> 01:05:53,680
The game should have better accessibility by reading the instructions instead of having us reading it.

1782
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:53,780
The game should have better accessibility by reading the instructions instead of having us reading it.

1783
01:05:56,340 --> 01:06:00,940
The game should have better accessibility by reading the instructions instead of having us reading it.

1784
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:05,760
The game should have better accessibility by reading the instructions instead of having us reading it.

1785
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:11,020
Yeah, but the video had zero narration and that was the problem.

1786
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:14,040
The game needed narration.

1787
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:30,920
Why were the tasks video form but the tutorial didn't give us these tasks and the tutorial?

1788
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:32,960
How?

1789
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:35,300
We had 19 minutes!

1790
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:37,600
How are we still doing this?

1791
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:50,300
How many VTubers does it take to do the... Please!

1792
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:51,300
Please!

1793
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:52,440
Oh!

1794
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:53,220
Wait!

1795
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:53,760
They did it!

1796
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:54,240
Are they doing it?

1797
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:54,920
Please!

1798
01:06:55,260 --> 01:06:55,760
Please!

1799
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:56,420
Oh!

1800
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:57,980
Wait!

1801
01:06:58,140 --> 01:06:59,100
Did it work?

1802
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:00,480
No way!

1803
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:00,900
No way!

1804
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:02,000
What is the task?

1805
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:03,900
Wait!

1806
01:07:04,740 --> 01:07:05,340
Yeah!

1807
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:07,380
I did it!

1808
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:11,080
Oh my gosh!

1809
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:13,320
You just did it!

1810
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:14,520
Yeah!

1811
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:17,240
Yeah!

1812
01:07:19,220 --> 01:07:19,820
Yeah!

1813
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:24,600
Oh my gosh!

1814
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:28,520
If you start from the lowest canisters and then hop power them.

1815
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:30,100
If they pop, they need a higher canister.

1816
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:32,280
So you go from the lowest you can possibly do.

1817
01:07:32,580 --> 01:07:35,080
And then if they pop you, you upgrade the canister.

1818
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:36,720
Oh my gosh!

1819
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:38,940
Oh my gosh!

1820
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:39,420
Alright, Lime.

1821
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:40,700
You're on canister duty.

1822
01:07:41,420 --> 01:07:42,420
Lime, you're on...

1823
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:46,460
You did it!

1824
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:47,720
You did it!

1825
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:51,280
So surely this time we're ready to do two entire tasks.

1826
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:51,540
Yeah!

1827
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:52,480
Are we guys... Are we ready?

1828
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:54,120
Are we actually ready, guys?

1829
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:55,560
I think we should do three.

1830
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:56,240
Alright.

1831
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:57,460
I think we should do three.

1832
01:07:57,460 --> 01:07:58,120
Alright.

1833
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,240
I'm putting it on.

1834
01:07:59,300 --> 01:07:59,740
Alright, guys.

1835
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:03,600
I believe in... Three tasks?

1836
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:04,640
Alright, three tasks.

1837
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:05,560
I think we should do it.

1838
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:05,880
Alright.

1839
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:07,160
I'm going to put three tasks on.

1840
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:07,780
I'm going to do it.

1841
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:11,880
Oh my gosh.

1842
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:12,560
We finally did it.

1843
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:13,380
We figured out pressure.

1844
01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:15,040
We fucking figured...

1845
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:15,680
Alright, guys.

1846
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:17,200
Three different tasks.

1847
01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:19,980
Three different tasks.

1848
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:22,820
Pressure, scanner, and delivery.

1849
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:24,160
It's pressure.

1850
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:25,700
I want to do pressure.

1851
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:26,880
Pressure, pressure.

1852
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:27,600
I'm doing delivery!

1853
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:29,880
Delivery is the easiest.

1854
01:08:30,180 --> 01:08:31,380
So I call dibs.

1855
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:31,940
Okay, where's pressure?

1856
01:08:32,540 --> 01:08:33,020
Yeah!

1857
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:34,420
You just deliver things.

1858
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:36,620
Okay, okay.

1859
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:38,800
Delivery.

1860
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:39,280
Okay.

1861
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:41,300
Wait, what is this?

1862
01:08:41,420 --> 01:08:42,100
Okay, security.

1863
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:44,900
I got one of the boxes.

1864
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:47,300
We can do this, guys.

1865
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:47,960
Pressure!

1866
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:48,460
Pressure!

1867
01:08:48,820 --> 01:08:54,980
By the time we could... By the time we figure this out, we can quit our jobs as VTubers and go back to minimum wage.

1868
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:55,540
By the time we could...

1869
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:55,540
By the time we figure this out, we can quit our jobs as VTubers and go back to minimum wage.

1870
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:57,240
Okay, this way.

1871
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:01,720
It's not gonna be a loss.

1872
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:03,000
Alright, nice.

1873
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:04,940
Alright.

1874
01:09:05,820 --> 01:09:07,880
To make sure nobody starts killing.

1875
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:10,060
I did it.

1876
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:11,840
Did I do it?

1877
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:14,220
How many deliveries do I have to do?

1878
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:20,040
Oh my god, that's a lot.

1879
01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:22,260
Wait, what do I do after I put it in?

1880
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:23,760
Oh, it doesn't matter.

1881
01:09:23,940 --> 01:09:26,360
We just... Okay, I gotta go back to the boxes.

1882
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:27,860
Do delivery with me.

1883
01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:28,900
We gotta do our jobs.

1884
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:33,020
Alright, this way.

1885
01:09:38,260 --> 01:09:40,500
Oh, you're already getting another delivery going.

1886
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:40,980
Okay.

1887
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:45,220
Alright, where are some more boxes?

1888
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:46,120
Oh, I got another box!

1889
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:49,040
PC.

1890
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:50,400
I'm going to the PC room.

1891
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:53,400
There's another box over there!

1892
01:09:55,860 --> 01:09:56,800
Wait, what?

1893
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,700
Why did I hear that?

1894
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:08,740
I didn't say anybody got a knife.

1895
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:09,820
Okay.

1896
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:20,160
Wait, that was a gunshot.

1897
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:22,120
I think Snuffy killed somebody or...

1898
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:25,040
I think... I think Snuffy already killed somebody.

1899
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,120
That was a gunshot right there.

1900
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:29,080
Oh, wait.

1901
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:29,680
Wait.

1902
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:31,520
The gunshot was this way.

1903
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:32,560
Oh, there they are!

1904
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:33,220
There you guys are!

1905
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:35,700
Alright, I'll watch.

1906
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:36,260
I'll watch.

1907
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:37,520
I'll film it.

1908
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:38,760
I'll film it like a documentary.

1909
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:40,860
Alright, do you guys just say any, like...

1910
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:43,700
Any final words?

1911
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:45,260
Wait, you guys should give, like, confessions.

1912
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:47,160
You should guys give confessions to each other.

1913
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:53,740
I know we just met, but knowing that our birthdays are, like, ten days apart from Valentine's Day is so romantic.

1914
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:55,620
I think so, too.

1915
01:10:55,760 --> 01:11:04,060
I think that the biggest sign for me to know that we were always destined to be together was that the day that you landed on Earth was that special fourth day.

1916
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,400
The day that brings us together.

1917
01:11:06,820 --> 01:11:07,380
Oh, my God.

1918
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:07,960
My God, it's empty.

1919
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:09,260
My God, it's empty.

1920
01:11:09,260 --> 01:11:09,760
Your God is empty?

1921
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:11,680
Were you trying to shoot her before?

1922
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:15,320
Were you trying to kill her before she could finish her line?

1923
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:19,020
I'm gonna take his whole life.

1924
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:19,540
Oh, my...

1925
01:11:28,070 --> 01:11:29,610
What the fuck?

1926
01:11:30,030 --> 01:11:33,470
Okay, so I heard three gunshots while we were listening.

1927
01:11:34,010 --> 01:11:37,590
Hey, how come I heard three gunshots while the...

1928
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:39,270
while it was happening?

1929
01:11:39,510 --> 01:11:42,230
That was definitely just part of the background noise, I think.

1930
01:11:42,770 --> 01:11:45,110
Yeah, probably the background noise?

1931
01:11:45,370 --> 01:11:45,930
Okay.

1932
01:11:47,490 --> 01:11:49,230
If you say so.

1933
01:11:52,230 --> 01:11:52,930
All right.

1934
01:11:58,540 --> 01:12:00,620
Why did I hear another gunshot?

1935
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:02,720
Don't worry about it.

1936
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:04,720
That's just the background environment.

1937
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,040
Why did I hear that?

1938
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:08,580
Oh, it's the pressure.

1939
01:12:08,780 --> 01:12:12,260
It was the pressure.

1940
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:13,980
Wait, where is that going to?

1941
01:12:14,860 --> 01:12:15,820
It's always...

1942
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:19,780
I'm still trying to do pressure.

1943
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:22,640
Wait, did somebody die?

1944
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,980
Somebody... did somebody die?

1945
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:28,700
Wait.

1946
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:32,040
There's still three deliveries.

1947
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:32,940
Woo!

1948
01:12:33,580 --> 01:12:34,400
The box!

1949
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:38,150
Oh, boom!

1950
01:12:38,310 --> 01:12:38,810
Boom, skip!

1951
01:12:38,910 --> 01:12:40,070
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!

1952
01:12:40,450 --> 01:12:40,930
Boom!

1953
01:12:44,710 --> 01:12:47,330
Val tried to smack me with a box!

1954
01:12:47,670 --> 01:12:49,650
Val tried to smack me with a box!

1955
01:12:49,670 --> 01:12:50,250
She's a killer!

1956
01:12:51,710 --> 01:12:52,550
She's a killer!

1957
01:12:53,910 --> 01:12:54,390
Okay.

1958
01:12:54,530 --> 01:12:55,850
Okay, wait, let me do this.

1959
01:12:55,850 --> 01:12:56,650
Let me do this first.

1960
01:12:56,750 --> 01:12:58,010
I'm going to be the guard at the door.

1961
01:12:58,090 --> 01:12:58,410
Wait, wait.

1962
01:12:58,410 --> 01:12:59,010
Give me that box.

1963
01:12:59,090 --> 01:12:59,690
I need that box.

1964
01:12:59,850 --> 01:13:00,790
We need complete delivery.

1965
01:13:02,610 --> 01:13:03,830
It's F, F, press F.

1966
01:13:04,170 --> 01:13:05,190
I have bad news.

1967
01:13:05,230 --> 01:13:06,850
I have forgotten how to drop things.

1968
01:13:06,870 --> 01:13:07,450
Press F.

1969
01:13:07,490 --> 01:13:08,430
Right-click, left-click.

1970
01:13:08,510 --> 01:13:08,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1971
01:13:09,630 --> 01:13:10,230
All right.

1972
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:10,430
Nice.

1973
01:13:11,010 --> 01:13:11,410
Okay.

1974
01:13:12,010 --> 01:13:12,410
Computer.

1975
01:13:13,370 --> 01:13:14,110
Oh, nice.

1976
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:14,950
Okay, guys.

1977
01:13:15,070 --> 01:13:15,530
I need...

1978
01:13:15,530 --> 01:13:16,970
Val has the final delivery.

1979
01:13:17,510 --> 01:13:18,350
Guys, guys.

1980
01:13:18,770 --> 01:13:21,190
Val's holding the final delivery box hostage.

1981
01:13:21,270 --> 01:13:22,350
We have to kill her together.

1982
01:13:22,790 --> 01:13:25,170
She's literally holding the last box.

1983
01:13:25,190 --> 01:13:25,830
We can't kill her.

1984
01:13:25,830 --> 01:13:26,570
We have to complete it.

1985
01:13:26,690 --> 01:13:28,090
We have to kill...

1986
01:13:28,090 --> 01:13:29,030
We got to kill her.

1987
01:13:30,590 --> 01:13:32,150
Guys, okay.

1988
01:13:32,290 --> 01:13:33,910
I'm going to smack her, guys.

1989
01:13:34,170 --> 01:13:35,270
You guys defend me.

1990
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:36,770
We got it.

1991
01:13:36,790 --> 01:13:37,590
We got to kill her.

1992
01:13:38,350 --> 01:13:39,570
You guys got to get this.

1993
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:41,590
Guys, we have two minutes.

1994
01:13:41,670 --> 01:13:42,470
Get over here, Val.

1995
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:50,980
Okay, let's finish this job.

1996
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:52,260
Let's finish this.

1997
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:54,580
Okay.

1998
01:13:55,020 --> 01:13:56,440
Okay, we did it.

1999
01:13:56,660 --> 01:13:57,660
Oh, no.

2000
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:59,160
This is the computer room.

2001
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:00,040
All right.

2002
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:02,480
Where the fuck is the thing?

2003
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:03,520
Okay.

2004
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:05,640
We killed her.

2005
01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:06,160
Okay.

2006
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:08,280
We did it, guys.

2007
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:09,680
Yippie.

2008
01:14:09,860 --> 01:14:12,440
Where the fuck is the thing for this?

2009
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:14,000
Oh, no.

2010
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:16,960
Oh, it's over here.

2011
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:17,740
Are you going to do the scanner with me?

2012
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:18,120
Yeah.

2013
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:19,540
Let me put this last box.

2014
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:20,980
Wait.

2015
01:14:20,980 --> 01:14:21,180
What?

2016
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:21,760
Wait.

2017
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:23,040
You have to deliver the last box.

2018
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:23,900
We're going to do the scanner.

2019
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:26,720
Yeah.

2020
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:27,020
Yeah.

2021
01:14:27,020 --> 01:14:27,180
Yeah.

2022
01:14:27,180 --> 01:14:27,280
Yeah.

2023
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:27,660
I know.

2024
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:29,020
Alright, you guys, why don't you guys do the scatter?

2025
01:14:29,820 --> 01:14:31,940
This goes to... we have two minutes.

2026
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:33,400
Alright, I'll do scatter, I'll do scatter.

2027
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:35,940
I'll do scatter since I'm already good at this.

2028
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:38,360
Okay, Rin, you deliver.

2029
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:39,980
Rin, you deliver.

2030
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:41,820
And then I do scan.

2031
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:44,020
I'll do the direction.

2032
01:14:44,020 --> 01:14:44,580
I'll do the direction.

2033
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:47,100
Alright, wait, it's here, it's here.

2034
01:14:47,220 --> 01:14:48,580
Okay, okay, I'm standing in the middle.

2035
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:48,820
Hurry!

2036
01:14:48,980 --> 01:14:50,080
One minute, 30 seconds.

2037
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:50,680
This is it.

2038
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:51,320
This is the last one.

2039
01:14:51,940 --> 01:14:53,940
Okay, to your right, a little bit, a little nudge.

2040
01:14:54,220 --> 01:14:54,540
Yeah.

2041
01:14:54,540 --> 01:14:56,940
The delivery isn't done either, for what it's worth.

2042
01:14:57,020 --> 01:14:57,500
Yeah, right there, hold.

2043
01:14:57,700 --> 01:14:58,060
Yeah.

2044
01:14:58,140 --> 01:14:59,720
Okay, go left, a little bit.

2045
01:14:59,980 --> 01:15:00,700
Little bit more.

2046
01:15:01,140 --> 01:15:01,820
Little bit more.

2047
01:15:02,420 --> 01:15:03,580
Up two little bits.

2048
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:05,840
Again.

2049
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:06,200
Up.

2050
01:15:06,860 --> 01:15:07,800
Right a little bit.

2051
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:08,980
Okay, hold.

2052
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:09,780
Okay.

2053
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:11,620
Go really far left.

2054
01:15:13,580 --> 01:15:14,300
Uh, yep.

2055
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:15,600
Oh, a little bit more right.

2056
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:17,820
Yeah, right there, and then down a little bit.

2057
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:19,000
Little bit more.

2058
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:19,780
Little bit more.

2059
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:20,360
Little bit more.

2060
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:20,880
Little bit more.

2061
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:21,860
Right there, hold.

2062
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:23,480
How many more left?

2063
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:24,880
Right a little bit.

2064
01:15:25,260 --> 01:15:26,420
Go right a little bit.

2065
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:28,580
Uh, go down.

2066
01:15:29,260 --> 01:15:29,740
Down.

2067
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:30,560
Down.

2068
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:31,320
Down.

2069
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:31,940
Down.

2070
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:33,020
Right there, hold.

2071
01:15:33,820 --> 01:15:35,180
Uh, go really far right.

2072
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:37,480
Uh, go up.

2073
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:39,540
We can do this!

2074
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:42,280
We can do this!

2075
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:43,300
Really far up.

2076
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:44,680
Really far up.

2077
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:45,340
Okay.

2078
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,540
Okay, perfect.

2079
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:48,200
Uh, hold.

2080
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:50,800
Right like a hair.

2081
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:51,820
Yeah, hold.

2082
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:52,860
Go left.

2083
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:55,160
A little bit left.

2084
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:56,200
Go down.

2085
01:15:56,340 --> 01:15:58,240
No pressure, but you have 13 seconds.

2086
01:15:58,780 --> 01:16:01,280
No pressure, but if you fail this, you have 10 seconds.

2087
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:02,020
Go up a little bit.

2088
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:04,560
Okay, go, go really far right.

2089
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:05,440
13 seconds.

2090
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:07,400
No!

2091
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:10,100
Why did you stop?

2092
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:11,440
Why did you?

2093
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:14,600
Why?

2094
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:16,920
Why did you stop?

2095
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:18,340
Why did you stop?

2096
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:21,720
We could have done it.

2097
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:22,900
We did it!

2098
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:25,440
We did it!

2099
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:25,980
We did it!

2100
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:27,720
Yeah!

2101
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:33,480
Yeah, we were so close!

2102
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:34,120
Yeah, we were so close!

2103
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:35,140
I literally have brain damage.

2104
01:16:36,340 --> 01:16:38,280
We could have done it.

2105
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:39,060
Thank you.

2106
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:39,160
Thank you.

2107
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:44,040
How many did I have left?

2108
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:45,700
How many did I have left?

2109
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:46,480
How many did I have left?

2110
01:16:46,540 --> 01:16:48,960
You had two more.

2111
01:16:49,620 --> 01:16:50,140
No!

2112
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:56,440
I can't believe you took the box hostage!

2113
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:58,920
I can't believe it!

2114
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:00,700
We caught you!

2115
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:01,820
We caught you!

2116
01:17:01,820 --> 01:17:01,860
We caught you!

2117
01:17:01,860 --> 01:17:02,500
We caught you!

2118
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:03,320
We caught you!

2119
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:04,100
We caught you!

2120
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:05,160
We caught you!

2121
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:09,580
Oh my gosh!

2122
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:17,080
Guys, please, employees have to win a regular game!

2123
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:18,060
I swear!

2124
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:18,780
I swear!

2125
01:17:18,780 --> 01:17:19,960
I swear!

2126
01:17:22,980 --> 01:17:27,540
We just need one regular win as an employee!

2127
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,300
Guys, please!

2128
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:30,640
We can do this!

2129
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:32,480
Oh my gosh!

2130
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:38,440
Alright, scatter!

2131
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:40,380
Who wants to do scatter?

2132
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:45,880
I'm going to do the scatter!

2133
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:49,400
Somebody do it!

2134
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:50,760
I'm going to do the scatter first!

2135
01:17:50,940 --> 01:17:51,900
I learned my lesson!

2136
01:17:55,060 --> 01:17:55,760
Alright.

2137
01:17:57,260 --> 01:18:00,000
Alright, I'm so well versed in the scatter.

2138
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:01,420
I can do it!

2139
01:18:01,780 --> 01:18:03,960
Alright, now that there's zero pressure!

2140
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:06,440
Now that there's zero pressure!

2141
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:07,900
Do you want to scatter?

2142
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:07,920
Alright.

2143
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:08,380
Okay.

2144
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:12,280
More up.

2145
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:12,840
Alright.

2146
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:14,320
Up quite a bit.

2147
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:15,760
Quite a bit.

2148
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:16,240
Yep, yep, yep.

2149
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:17,160
Down just slightly.

2150
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:18,260
There you go.

2151
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:20,040
Oh my god, alright, seven left.

2152
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:21,700
Hop a square.

2153
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:24,300
A bit more.

2154
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:26,260
Cool, down.

2155
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:28,800
And then right slightly.

2156
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,180
Right, kind of like diagonal.

2157
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:31,720
And then, yep, down.

2158
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:34,760
Perfect, there we go.

2159
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:37,900
You can go down for three seconds.

2160
01:18:39,980 --> 01:18:41,140
You can go down for three seconds.

2161
01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:41,620
You can go down for three seconds.

2162
01:18:41,620 --> 01:18:41,780
Yes!

2163
01:18:50,620 --> 01:18:51,680
You sabotaged, Snuffy.

2164
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:52,400
Yes!

2165
01:18:52,420 --> 01:18:53,080
A little bit.

2166
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:56,940
Wait, you just, oh my god, you can overlap.

2167
01:18:57,160 --> 01:18:58,760
Holy shit, you just went to the other side.

2168
01:18:58,840 --> 01:18:59,380
Okay, go up.

2169
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:00,460
Up, up, up, up.

2170
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:03,300
Keep going until I say.

2171
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:06,000
Keep going, keep going, stop.

2172
01:19:07,220 --> 01:19:07,940
And right.

2173
01:19:10,020 --> 01:19:10,860
Stop and down.

2174
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:12,860
Stop and down.

2175
01:19:12,860 --> 01:19:13,720
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

2176
01:19:13,740 --> 01:19:16,000
A bit more, a bit more diagonal downish.

2177
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:16,600
Right.

2178
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:17,720
Oh, I see it!

2179
01:19:17,780 --> 01:19:18,640
I got it!

2180
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:20,200
Yep, left.

2181
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:22,200
Up there.

2182
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:23,980
Keep going, keep going, keep going.

2183
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:24,300
Stop.

2184
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:25,500
And up.

2185
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:27,200
And right.

2186
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:28,780
Snuffy, I swear to god, I see you have a screwdriver.

2187
01:19:29,140 --> 01:19:30,560
I swear to god, Snuffy.

2188
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:34,520
I swear to god, I worked so hard for this.

2189
01:19:34,540 --> 01:19:36,660
I swear to god, I worked so hard for this.

2190
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:37,920
I swear to god, I worked so hard for this.

2191
01:19:38,620 --> 01:19:40,040
I swear to god.

2192
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:43,160
If you're gonna kill us, kill us after we do the scan.

2193
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:44,120
Please.

2194
01:19:45,660 --> 01:19:46,440
Go right.

2195
01:19:46,860 --> 01:19:47,700
Go right.

2196
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:51,740
Kill us after we do the scan.

2197
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:52,520
I swear to god.

2198
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:55,100
Further down and right.

2199
01:19:55,460 --> 01:19:56,280
There you go, perfect.

2200
01:19:57,220 --> 01:19:59,320
Down, down, down.

2201
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:00,380
Keep going.

2202
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:01,580
Full square down.

2203
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:03,000
Keep going, keep going, keep going.

2204
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:04,800
Faster, faster, faster, faster.

2205
01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:05,800
You got this, you got this.

2206
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:06,720
Okay, and...

2207
01:20:07,940 --> 01:20:09,340
And left slightly and down.

2208
01:20:09,340 --> 01:20:11,140
And left slightly and down.

2209
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:11,680
Okay.

2210
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:13,840
There you go, perfect.

2211
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:15,400
And left.

2212
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:18,520
Snuffy, I swear to god.

2213
01:20:18,820 --> 01:20:20,680
I swear to god.

2214
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:23,940
I swear to god.

2215
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:36,540
And left.

2216
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:37,320
And left.

2217
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:37,920
And left.

2218
01:20:37,940 --> 01:20:42,240
She's like the kid with the...

2219
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:42,640
I got it.

2220
01:20:43,900 --> 01:20:45,700
I'm so alive.

2221
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:46,620
I'm so pleased.

2222
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:55,540
I didn't even finish.

2223
01:20:56,020 --> 01:20:59,980
You couldn't let me finish this.

2224
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:01,120
You couldn't let me finish this.

2225
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:01,880
What's gonna happen?

2226
01:21:02,020 --> 01:21:03,580
You said something.

2227
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:06,140
Snuffy, I thought you were gonna protect us.

2228
01:21:06,140 --> 01:21:08,340
Snuffy, why were you...

2229
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:10,100
You didn't protect us.

2230
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:11,600
I killed this guy.

2231
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:12,620
I killed this guy.

2232
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:14,560
You're supposed to kill Matara.

2233
01:21:16,060 --> 01:21:18,600
I just started blasting.

2234
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,300
I just started blasting.

2235
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:24,220
I went to go kill Bao.

2236
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:25,580
And I stabbed her once.

2237
01:21:25,660 --> 01:21:27,360
Oh my god.

2238
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:31,260
She died before I could kill her.

2239
01:21:31,780 --> 01:21:34,180
Oh my god.

2240
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,040
I was so close.

2241
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:38,200
I was so close to finishing that task.

2242
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:41,340
I just wanted to finish Tanner.

2243
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:43,620
We all were like two left.

2244
01:21:44,420 --> 01:21:49,720
I requested to die after.

2245
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:57,360
How many times is Matara the traitor?

2246
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:02,020
Guys, we need to kill Matara first.

2247
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:03,240
She's always the traitor.

2248
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:06,980
Guys.

2249
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:10,260
Employee meeting right now.

2250
01:22:10,580 --> 01:22:12,680
I vote that we kill Matara first.

2251
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:18,500
I vote that we kill Matara first.

2252
01:22:20,740 --> 01:22:22,060
Oh my gosh, she is.

2253
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:23,800
She's gonna fucking eat her head.

2254
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:28,600
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

2255
01:22:28,660 --> 01:22:29,820
We need to kill her first next game.

2256
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:30,700
We need to kill her first.

2257
01:22:30,700 --> 01:22:31,920
Why is somebody talking?

2258
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:35,520
We're haunting.

2259
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:36,040
Why is somebody talking?

2260
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:37,520
We're haunting you.

2261
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:38,880
Guys.

2262
01:22:40,700 --> 01:22:41,380
Guys.

2263
01:22:45,380 --> 01:22:47,260
Wait, who's still alive?

2264
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:49,520
Wait, who's still alive?

2265
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:50,180
Who's still alive?

2266
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:50,820
Who's hiding?

2267
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:54,580
Who the fuck is still alive?

2268
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:56,100
Oh my god.

2269
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:59,680
Who the fuck is still alive?

2270
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:01,100
The voices.

2271
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:02,840
What do the voices say?

2272
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:04,880
Oh my god.

2273
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:07,120
There's so many dead bodies.

2274
01:23:07,740 --> 01:23:09,840
What do the voices say?

2275
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:13,020
Wait.

2276
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:17,260
She's gonna do this herself.

2277
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:18,920
Holy shit, she's gaming.

2278
01:23:19,380 --> 01:23:20,620
Oh my god.

2279
01:23:20,620 --> 01:23:21,880
I was gaming.

2280
01:23:22,380 --> 01:23:24,200
Oh my god.

2281
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:27,460
I was gaming.

2282
01:23:29,220 --> 01:23:32,300
She's actually gaming right now.

2283
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:33,400
She's actually gaming right now.

2284
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:33,640
She's actually gaming right now.

2285
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:34,540
Holy shit.

2286
01:23:34,860 --> 01:23:34,920
Holy shit.

2287
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:36,780
Oh my god.

2288
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:40,960
She's just leaving her so vulnerable to Mataya when she comes in.

2289
01:23:41,460 --> 01:23:42,560
Oh my god.

2290
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:43,400
She's just leaving her so vulnerable to Mataya when she comes in.

2291
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:45,140
Oh no.

2292
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:48,520
She's alone though.

2293
01:23:48,620 --> 01:23:50,340
She's leaving herself vulnerable to Mataya.

2294
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:52,500
She's leaving herself vulnerable to Mataya.

2295
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:52,500
Zara!

2296
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:54,320
She's just standing there!

2297
01:23:54,680 --> 01:23:55,240
Defenseless!

2298
01:23:57,560 --> 01:24:00,080
She's doing better than both me and you did together.

2299
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:02,060
She go!

2300
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:02,740
What?!

2301
01:24:02,740 --> 01:24:04,340
What do you mean?!

2302
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:09,840
I don't think...

2303
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:11,200
Oh!

2304
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:12,180
Oh!

2305
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:12,540
Up!

2306
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:12,720
Up!

2307
01:24:12,780 --> 01:24:13,300
Come on!

2308
01:24:22,460 --> 01:24:23,460
She's so close!

2309
01:24:23,620 --> 01:24:24,100
Stop!

2310
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:25,280
Stop going down!

2311
01:24:25,780 --> 01:24:26,480
Yes!

2312
01:24:29,410 --> 01:24:31,890
She did it!

2313
01:24:32,510 --> 01:24:36,130
What a game!

2314
01:24:38,150 --> 01:24:39,810
She's such a game!

2315
01:24:41,170 --> 01:24:53,440
She has 30 seconds!

2316
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:57,880
Go live!

2317
01:24:59,000 --> 01:24:59,120
No!

2318
01:24:59,260 --> 01:24:59,820
Save me!

2319
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:01,240
What happened?!

2320
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:01,560
Save her!

2321
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:02,440
Oh god!

2322
01:25:02,700 --> 01:25:03,240
Come on!

2323
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:10,500
Don't do it!

2324
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:11,200
Don't do it!

2325
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:14,180
She has 10 seconds!

2326
01:25:14,700 --> 01:25:16,680
Don't even look at the tablet!

2327
01:25:19,780 --> 01:25:20,800
We did it!

2328
01:25:20,860 --> 01:25:21,840
Only one second!

2329
01:25:22,220 --> 01:25:24,340
Oh my god!

2330
01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:25,340
I'm so...

2331
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:30,240
Oh my god!

2332
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:31,620
We did it!

2333
01:25:32,660 --> 01:25:33,720
We did it!

2334
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:34,080
What the hell?

2335
01:25:34,340 --> 01:25:34,900
We did it!

2336
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:34,920
Really?!

2337
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:35,440
We're okay!

2338
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:36,700
I just like...

2339
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:37,300
Real quick!

2340
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:39,480
I just like to go over our battle strategy for the next game.

2341
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:40,100
So...

2342
01:25:40,100 --> 01:25:41,360
You die!

2343
01:25:41,460 --> 01:25:41,740
Go on!

2344
01:25:41,860 --> 01:25:43,160
We kill Matara first!

2345
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:44,960
She dies!

2346
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:48,520
Statistically we have to kill her!

2347
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:51,400
We all agree!

2348
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:52,500
End of board meeting!

2349
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:54,320
We all agree!

2350
01:25:55,270 --> 01:25:59,140
In our board meeting, we have decided that Matara dies first!

2351
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:02,100
Alright!

2352
01:26:02,540 --> 01:26:04,000
We're starting the game!

2353
01:26:06,980 --> 01:26:07,640
Yeah!

2354
01:26:08,420 --> 01:26:09,080
Yeah!

2355
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:09,380
Yeah!

2356
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:11,800
If she refuses, we follow her to do tasks!

2357
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:13,740
Yeah!

2358
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:15,580
Yeah!

2359
01:26:15,580 --> 01:26:15,660
Yeah!

2360
01:26:15,660 --> 01:26:15,840
Yeah!

2361
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:16,400
Yeah!

2362
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:16,580
Yeah!

2363
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:18,360
Yeah!

2364
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:18,680
We bad!

2365
01:26:19,860 --> 01:26:21,940
You should pick up your weapon!

2366
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:24,360
I won't give you the weapon, Matara.

2367
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:25,720
We will judge your performance.

2368
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:26,840
We will...

2369
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:28,060
I know what you are...

2370
01:26:28,060 --> 01:26:30,300
We know what you are...

2371
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:31,920
I know what you are...

2372
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:34,900
And you just aren't the father!

2373
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:35,520
...in uniform!

2374
01:26:36,340 --> 01:26:38,660
We're gonna stab her like Julius Caesar.

2375
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:40,820
Hell yeah, hell yeah!

2376
01:26:41,380 --> 01:26:42,020
Why would I be training?

2377
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:47,400
Why would I be training?

2378
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:48,220
I'm always in play!

2379
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:48,340
I'm always in play!

2380
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:52,500
It doesn't matter.

2381
01:26:52,580 --> 01:26:53,420
Do your task.

2382
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:55,700
That's what they all say.

2383
01:26:58,380 --> 01:27:00,940
Alright, but Tara should do the scanner.

2384
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:04,320
I hereby dub this the scanner girl.

2385
01:27:04,980 --> 01:27:05,540
Let's go.

2386
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:08,180
Alright, we're gonna put her in the square.

2387
01:27:09,020 --> 01:27:10,640
We're gonna put her in the square.

2388
01:27:11,220 --> 01:27:11,940
Let's go.

2389
01:27:11,940 --> 01:27:12,900
We're in the square.

2390
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:13,520
Scam me.

2391
01:27:13,620 --> 01:27:14,120
I'll go.

2392
01:27:14,460 --> 01:27:15,100
Scam me.

2393
01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:15,720
Alright.

2394
01:27:16,660 --> 01:27:18,540
Wait, the scanner's this way.

2395
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:21,020
Okay, I forgot where it was.

2396
01:27:23,140 --> 01:27:23,620
This way.

2397
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:25,400
It's to the right.

2398
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:26,020
It's to the right.

2399
01:27:27,540 --> 01:27:28,020
Alright.

2400
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:33,100
Okay, get in that...

2401
01:27:34,140 --> 01:27:34,960
Tara, please.

2402
01:27:35,460 --> 01:27:35,940
Please.

2403
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:37,400
Tara, please.

2404
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:39,080
It's literally one square.

2405
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:39,420
No!

2406
01:27:46,570 --> 01:27:47,110
Look, look, look.

2407
01:27:47,130 --> 01:27:47,610
It's empty.

2408
01:27:47,910 --> 01:27:49,590
I swear to God, Dokie.

2409
01:27:49,710 --> 01:27:50,830
I swear to God it's in here.

2410
01:27:50,930 --> 01:27:52,270
It's not empty, Dokie.

2411
01:27:52,290 --> 01:27:53,110
I promise you.

2412
01:27:53,150 --> 01:27:53,490
It's not...

2413
01:27:54,210 --> 01:27:55,630
It's not empty!

2414
01:27:57,750 --> 01:27:58,930
It's not empty!

2415
01:28:03,870 --> 01:28:05,730
You shot me in the gut!

2416
01:28:06,150 --> 01:28:09,050
You had two bullets in the gut!

2417
01:28:10,810 --> 01:28:12,150
Oh my God.

2418
01:28:12,610 --> 01:28:15,030
Apparently, it's empty with my other hand.

2419
01:28:16,570 --> 01:28:17,950
I thought it was the gun that was empty.

2420
01:28:17,950 --> 01:28:20,810
Rather than literally everybody, the traffic could not be prevented.

2421
01:28:24,110 --> 01:28:27,230
I just wanted to do this again.

2422
01:28:29,270 --> 01:28:31,870
I just wanted to...

2423
01:28:31,870 --> 01:28:34,370
Okay, let's say right.

2424
01:28:34,410 --> 01:28:34,950
Let's say right.

2425
01:28:35,230 --> 01:28:36,010
Okay, right.

2426
01:28:36,270 --> 01:28:37,990
You shot me in the gut.

2427
01:28:39,110 --> 01:28:42,770
I like how you didn't register that you shot me in the gut.

2428
01:28:43,650 --> 01:28:45,990
And you're just like, how did she die?

2429
01:28:49,190 --> 01:28:50,830
How did you do that?

2430
01:28:51,350 --> 01:28:52,470
I don't know how many times I have to repeat this again.

2431
01:28:52,470 --> 01:28:52,590
You shot me in the gut.

2432
01:28:52,590 --> 01:28:56,750
Because you shot me in the head, so I jumped on the fleek flex.

2433
01:28:56,830 --> 01:28:58,730
And that was my last HP.

2434
01:28:59,210 --> 01:29:02,050
That was really my last HP.

2435
01:29:06,470 --> 01:29:08,230
Oh, my God.

2436
01:29:08,970 --> 01:29:11,030
It'll take some time, but it might get the best of you.

2437
01:29:11,030 --> 01:29:11,870
I got it, everybody else.

2438
01:29:11,950 --> 01:29:12,130
Yeah.

2439
01:29:12,310 --> 01:29:13,210
That was bad.

2440
01:29:13,210 --> 01:29:14,090
I know.

2441
01:29:14,090 --> 01:29:15,610
It's okay.

2442
01:29:15,710 --> 01:29:19,110
My sacrifice to eliminate you was worth it.

2443
01:29:23,170 --> 01:29:25,570
Everyone shall live now, technically.

2444
01:29:25,830 --> 01:29:27,070
Everyone shall live.

2445
01:29:27,670 --> 01:29:29,250
I wasn't the enemy.

2446
01:29:32,610 --> 01:29:34,270
Proceeds to shoot me.

2447
01:29:50,790 --> 01:29:53,390
Red flags have red flags.

2448
01:29:54,190 --> 01:29:56,250
Oh my god, they're cooking!

2449
01:29:57,670 --> 01:30:01,290
Can I be your scary dog outside while you do this?

2450
01:30:03,710 --> 01:30:04,650
They're cooking!

2451
01:30:05,390 --> 01:30:05,970
Do you have any guns?

2452
01:30:06,470 --> 01:30:08,550
Not for defense.

2453
01:30:16,310 --> 01:30:18,110
There's only one traitor.

2454
01:30:18,330 --> 01:30:20,590
If it's not Matara, it's somebody in this group.

2455
01:30:25,350 --> 01:30:27,470
VTuber does not know what vegetables are.

2456
01:30:44,090 --> 01:30:45,830
I just watched her shoot somebody.

2457
01:30:46,030 --> 01:30:46,910
She's coming over here.

2458
01:30:47,210 --> 01:30:48,530
Wait, who killed you?

2459
01:30:51,290 --> 01:30:52,650
Amelie, who killed you?

2460
01:30:54,170 --> 01:30:56,250
Wait, Amelie died.

2461
01:30:57,450 --> 01:30:58,510
Where did she go?

2462
01:31:00,870 --> 01:31:01,550
There's no pressure.

2463
01:31:01,870 --> 01:31:03,010
So what exploded?

2464
01:31:03,590 --> 01:31:04,850
There's no pressure!

2465
01:31:06,790 --> 01:31:08,490
I'm running from the crime!

2466
01:31:09,550 --> 01:31:11,310
Oh shit!

2467
01:31:14,090 --> 01:31:14,270
What?

2468
01:31:16,330 --> 01:31:17,910
Lime is definitely the killer.

2469
01:31:19,950 --> 01:31:21,510
So I have to...

2470
01:31:21,930 --> 01:31:22,170
Blaster!

2471
01:31:23,050 --> 01:31:23,530
Killer!

2472
01:31:23,910 --> 01:31:24,190
Killer!

2473
01:31:25,510 --> 01:31:26,150
Uh-oh.

2474
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:28,610
It's not me!

2475
01:31:28,670 --> 01:31:29,810
You're a catch-up to her!

2476
01:31:30,130 --> 01:31:31,030
I'm gonna run to death!

2477
01:31:31,190 --> 01:31:31,650
Help!

2478
01:31:32,010 --> 01:31:32,990
Bad boy, bad boy.

2479
01:31:34,110 --> 01:31:40,350
What is she doing?

2480
01:31:40,430 --> 01:31:40,910
What is she doing?

2481
01:31:40,930 --> 01:31:41,430
Oh my god.

2482
01:31:41,570 --> 01:31:42,130
Shoot her!

2483
01:31:42,290 --> 01:31:42,930
Shoot her!

2484
01:31:43,210 --> 01:31:43,610
What?

2485
01:31:43,650 --> 01:31:44,070
What is she doing?

2486
01:31:44,070 --> 01:31:44,070
What is she doing?

2487
01:31:44,090 --> 01:31:44,770
She's throwing a gun!

2488
01:31:46,970 --> 01:31:48,410
That's a cassette tape!

2489
01:31:49,790 --> 01:31:50,450
No!

2490
01:31:50,670 --> 01:31:51,950
She's gonna get away!

2491
01:31:55,330 --> 01:31:57,670
How did she keep getting guns?

2492
01:31:57,910 --> 01:31:59,470
She found three guns!

2493
01:32:02,890 --> 01:32:03,550
Oh shit!

2494
01:32:04,770 --> 01:32:07,950
How did you not find a gun and Lime found three?

2495
01:32:09,990 --> 01:32:12,510
She found three guns!

2496
01:32:14,110 --> 01:32:16,530
Those were all her empty guns.

2497
01:32:17,230 --> 01:32:19,290
Those were all her empty guns.

2498
01:32:19,870 --> 01:32:21,330
Oh my god, she's scheming.

2499
01:32:21,730 --> 01:32:23,110
Wait, did she kill you?

2500
01:32:23,470 --> 01:32:23,990
I don't know.

2501
01:32:24,110 --> 01:32:26,170
I don't know what the detonator did.

2502
01:32:26,350 --> 01:32:28,590
I don't think it does nothing.

2503
01:32:29,450 --> 01:32:30,910
I think that means...

2504
01:32:30,910 --> 01:32:31,930
Why are you detonating?

2505
01:32:32,030 --> 01:32:32,850
What are you...

2506
01:32:32,850 --> 01:32:33,530
Oh my god.

2507
01:32:33,830 --> 01:32:35,130
Juniper, our final hope.

2508
01:32:35,250 --> 01:32:35,950
You stay away!

2509
01:32:36,770 --> 01:32:38,090
Juniper, just kill it!

2510
01:32:38,230 --> 01:32:38,530
Juniper!

2511
01:32:40,410 --> 01:32:41,970
I know what you are!

2512
01:32:45,530 --> 01:32:47,410
I know what you are!

2513
01:32:48,010 --> 01:32:48,530
I know what you are!

2514
01:32:48,530 --> 01:32:48,990
Get up!

2515
01:32:51,770 --> 01:32:53,650
Juniper, why did you just watch it?

2516
01:32:53,650 --> 01:32:53,970
Juniper!

2517
01:32:54,730 --> 01:32:55,250
Why?

2518
01:32:56,090 --> 01:32:57,890
Why did you just watch?

2519
01:32:59,030 --> 01:33:00,890
Fucking, I know what you are!

2520
01:33:01,090 --> 01:33:03,910
By the way, you needed C4 with the detonator, Snuffy.

2521
01:33:04,110 --> 01:33:04,770
You need it.

2522
01:33:04,810 --> 01:33:05,690
You need it.

2523
01:33:05,690 --> 01:33:06,570
You need it.

2524
01:33:06,610 --> 01:33:08,290
There's not even C4 anywhere.

2525
01:33:08,350 --> 01:33:08,990
Where is it?

2526
01:33:09,150 --> 01:33:10,490
I don't fucking know.

2527
01:33:10,490 --> 01:33:12,950
Apparently, there's a C4 with the detonator.

2528
01:33:19,790 --> 01:33:21,870
It was like 200...

2529
01:33:22,490 --> 01:33:26,990
There's 200 bombs, 200 guns, but one detonator.

2530
01:33:28,970 --> 01:33:30,270
I guess so.

2531
01:33:30,390 --> 01:33:31,850
You can play C4 and then...

2532
01:33:32,270 --> 01:33:33,650
Oh my god, I wanna do that.

2533
01:33:34,150 --> 01:33:35,130
But like...

2534
01:33:35,710 --> 01:33:37,870
Wait, what did the detonator look like?

2535
01:33:37,910 --> 01:33:39,650
Wait, Snuffy, show me what the detonator looked like.

2536
01:33:40,750 --> 01:33:41,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2537
01:33:43,930 --> 01:33:45,190
Oh, is that it?

2538
01:33:46,370 --> 01:33:46,650
Yeah.

2539
01:33:50,490 --> 01:33:52,030
Oh, apparently it looks like a battery pack.

2540
01:33:52,130 --> 01:33:53,110
We should look for the C4!

2541
01:33:53,790 --> 01:33:55,070
We should look at what the C4...

2542
01:33:55,070 --> 01:33:56,290
It looks like a battery pack.

2543
01:33:56,370 --> 01:33:57,990
Let's find a C4 so we can do it next game.

2544
01:34:01,410 --> 01:34:02,590
Yeah, I wonder too.

2545
01:34:05,190 --> 01:34:06,370
Is that the C4?

2546
01:34:06,470 --> 01:34:07,570
Oh, yeah, that's the battery.

2547
01:34:10,490 --> 01:34:10,850
Yeah, that is!

2548
01:34:10,850 --> 01:34:11,170
That is!

2549
01:34:11,170 --> 01:34:11,630
That's the C4!

2550
01:34:11,930 --> 01:34:13,710
Okay, we should trick...

2551
01:34:14,190 --> 01:34:17,750
Okay, apparently somebody can hold onto the C4 and detonate it.

2552
01:34:18,130 --> 01:34:19,310
Like, detonate it.

2553
01:34:19,470 --> 01:34:21,790
We should trick someone into holding it next game.

2554
01:34:22,270 --> 01:34:24,870
No, no, no, no, no way.

2555
01:34:24,990 --> 01:34:27,450
Because it definitely says C4 when you pick it up.

2556
01:34:27,510 --> 01:34:29,470
Yeah, but nobody reads.

2557
01:34:29,530 --> 01:34:30,030
We're all YouTubers.

2558
01:34:30,450 --> 01:34:31,950
We have to have it be like...

2559
01:34:32,490 --> 01:34:33,850
Somebody is like...

2560
01:34:33,850 --> 01:34:34,430
Bow.

2561
01:34:34,630 --> 01:34:35,470
They take the fall.

2562
01:34:35,590 --> 01:34:36,130
You know, they kick...

2563
01:34:36,130 --> 01:34:36,450
No, no, no.

2564
01:34:38,130 --> 01:34:39,490
You know what this is.

2565
01:34:39,490 --> 01:34:43,070
Just go up to people and be like, hey everybody, what are we doing?

2566
01:34:43,270 --> 01:34:45,910
Just let it...

2567
01:34:45,910 --> 01:34:47,330
Just let it grind, you know?

2568
01:34:50,290 --> 01:34:50,850
Okay, okay.

2569
01:34:51,310 --> 01:34:54,110
I'm gonna... My next game, I'm just gonna try and find C4.

2570
01:34:54,250 --> 01:34:55,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2571
01:34:55,230 --> 01:34:56,750
We all go here and we'll be like...

2572
01:34:57,890 --> 01:34:58,710
I'm the leader.

2573
01:34:58,790 --> 01:35:02,690
I can set up the lobby so that we have a task that we haven't done before.

2574
01:35:02,990 --> 01:35:03,830
Dr. Carol!

2575
01:35:04,630 --> 01:35:05,030
What?

2576
01:35:05,610 --> 01:35:06,030
Dr. Carol!

2577
01:35:06,450 --> 01:35:06,610
What?

2578
01:35:11,390 --> 01:35:12,470
Oh, dear.

2579
01:35:13,850 --> 01:35:15,050
Okay, wait, wait.

2580
01:35:15,050 --> 01:35:15,790
You're making pizza?

2581
01:35:16,010 --> 01:35:18,050
Tell the Latinas I love them, sorry.

2582
01:35:23,630 --> 01:35:25,430
Is she the last one?

2583
01:35:26,550 --> 01:35:28,730
At least she's letting her finish pizza.

2584
01:35:30,350 --> 01:35:31,510
She really is.

2585
01:35:31,730 --> 01:35:33,730
Oh, my God.

2586
01:35:34,170 --> 01:35:35,930
Wait, how did you die, Juniper?

2587
01:35:35,930 --> 01:35:37,610
Juniper, you had a gun.

2588
01:35:39,170 --> 01:35:40,410
Juniper, you had a gun.

2589
01:35:40,430 --> 01:35:41,050
How did you die?

2590
01:35:42,170 --> 01:35:43,310
It had no ammo.

2591
01:35:43,470 --> 01:35:44,030
It was empty.

2592
01:35:44,150 --> 01:35:45,590
Did you just let her stab you?

2593
01:35:45,850 --> 01:35:47,310
It was kind of pathetic.

2594
01:35:48,290 --> 01:35:49,630
Wait, what happened?

2595
01:35:49,730 --> 01:35:50,990
What happened, Matara?

2596
01:35:51,430 --> 01:35:51,710
It had no ammo.

2597
01:35:52,870 --> 01:35:54,790
I stabbed her in the back.

2598
01:35:56,510 --> 01:35:59,410
I guess I put a melee with like a container or something.

2599
01:35:59,790 --> 01:36:01,150
I guess I forgot I could do that.

2600
01:36:02,010 --> 01:36:05,210
You could have grabbed the battery pack or something.

2601
01:36:05,210 --> 01:36:06,990
And slapped her.

2602
01:36:07,310 --> 01:36:10,930
Oh my god, Lab's just playing with her food right now.

2603
01:36:10,950 --> 01:36:12,470
She bounced the last one.

2604
01:36:13,630 --> 01:36:14,230
Container.

2605
01:36:15,630 --> 01:36:16,370
Container though.

2606
01:36:16,470 --> 01:36:17,430
That was so painful.

2607
01:36:18,050 --> 01:36:21,610
Well, at least we can learn how to make sushi.

2608
01:36:22,250 --> 01:36:24,250
Oh my god, that's lame.

2609
01:36:24,930 --> 01:36:26,510
She's like, oh, this could be a lot easier for all of us.

2610
01:36:26,870 --> 01:36:27,470
Surely.

2611
01:36:27,590 --> 01:36:31,270
We forced the whales to make sushi before that.

2612
01:36:31,370 --> 01:36:32,230
That's fucked.

2613
01:36:32,350 --> 01:36:33,010
That's fucked.

2614
01:36:33,670 --> 01:36:34,270
Before that.

2615
01:36:34,270 --> 01:36:35,190
Before that.

2616
01:36:35,210 --> 01:36:36,190
Now the ferret eats her.

2617
01:36:36,490 --> 01:36:38,110
She's marinating her.

2618
01:36:38,150 --> 01:36:40,790
Yeah, she's literally marinating.

2619
01:36:41,350 --> 01:36:42,370
Oh no.

2620
01:36:42,870 --> 01:36:47,230
The ferret's gonna get a juicy pizza with some whale toppings.

2621
01:36:47,630 --> 01:36:48,950
That would be delicious.

2622
01:36:49,330 --> 01:36:49,990
Oh.

2623
01:36:51,890 --> 01:36:53,490
She's sizing her up.

2624
01:36:53,510 --> 01:36:53,970
Oh god.

2625
01:36:54,290 --> 01:36:55,330
It's gonna be delicious.

2626
01:36:55,330 --> 01:36:57,750
Did we successfully make peace sushi?

2627
01:36:58,370 --> 01:36:59,330
Oh my god.

2628
01:37:00,330 --> 01:37:01,430
Oh my god.

2629
01:37:01,630 --> 01:37:02,150
Oh my god.

2630
01:37:02,590 --> 01:37:03,630
Oh my god.

2631
01:37:03,990 --> 01:37:04,350
Oh my god.

2632
01:37:04,350 --> 01:37:05,210
Whoa.

2633
01:37:07,150 --> 01:37:08,270
Then the rice.

2634
01:37:09,050 --> 01:37:10,430
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

2635
01:37:10,450 --> 01:37:11,750
Then I need to get some shrimp.

2636
01:37:11,930 --> 01:37:12,450
Mm-hmm.

2637
01:37:12,650 --> 01:37:13,310
Mm-hmm.

2638
01:37:13,750 --> 01:37:14,190
Okay.

2639
01:37:14,370 --> 01:37:14,810
Oh no.

2640
01:37:14,930 --> 01:37:15,370
Suits activation.

2641
01:37:16,070 --> 01:37:16,630
Tuna, salmon.

2642
01:37:17,070 --> 01:37:17,510
What?

2643
01:37:18,270 --> 01:37:18,710
Tuna?

2644
01:37:19,090 --> 01:37:19,530
Salmon?

2645
01:37:19,670 --> 01:37:19,770
No.

2646
01:37:20,470 --> 01:37:21,610
Where do I get the shrimp?

2647
01:37:21,650 --> 01:37:22,090
Oh.

2648
01:37:22,690 --> 01:37:24,150
Where did she get the fish?

2649
01:37:24,390 --> 01:37:25,110
The shrimp button.

2650
01:37:25,830 --> 01:37:26,590
And what happens?

2651
01:37:26,610 --> 01:37:27,790
If you prison more than once, does it...

2652
01:37:27,790 --> 01:37:28,030
Oh, oh.

2653
01:37:28,170 --> 01:37:28,610
Oh.

2654
01:37:29,610 --> 01:37:30,690
There you go.

2655
01:37:30,730 --> 01:37:31,190
There you go.

2656
01:37:31,650 --> 01:37:34,090
I like how it's the traitor teaching the...

2657
01:37:34,090 --> 01:37:35,750
The employee how to do the task.

2658
01:37:39,130 --> 01:37:42,330
Lime has to be the only one that knows how to read out of all of us.

2659
01:37:45,710 --> 01:37:48,110
She's the only one that knows how to read.

2660
01:37:48,890 --> 01:37:49,870
This might be the win.

2661
01:37:49,930 --> 01:37:51,670
All Lime has is a knife.

2662
01:37:51,790 --> 01:37:52,110
She can...

2663
01:37:52,110 --> 01:37:54,050
She can run if she completes the task.

2664
01:37:56,030 --> 01:37:57,150
She just feels...

2665
01:37:57,150 --> 01:37:58,030
What about the alimentations?

2666
01:37:58,030 --> 01:37:58,910
Which I'm not sure about.

2667
01:37:58,910 --> 01:37:59,330
Where'd they go?

2668
01:37:59,450 --> 01:38:00,170
I kinda want to...

2669
01:38:00,170 --> 01:38:02,690
Oh, that's the one where you need to find the plant and stuff.

2670
01:38:03,190 --> 01:38:04,170
I think, right?

2671
01:38:04,630 --> 01:38:05,350
I don't know.

2672
01:38:05,570 --> 01:38:06,430
I don't remember.

2673
01:38:06,810 --> 01:38:07,930
I don't remember.

2674
01:38:09,090 --> 01:38:10,590
Did we get the sushi?

2675
01:38:10,590 --> 01:38:12,070
At least we know how to make food.

2676
01:38:12,390 --> 01:38:12,990
Wait, where did they go?

2677
01:38:13,250 --> 01:38:13,510
I know.

2678
01:38:13,530 --> 01:38:13,990
I'm like, wow.

2679
01:38:14,610 --> 01:38:15,870
I'm learning so many things.

2680
01:38:15,870 --> 01:38:16,930
We're learning so...

2681
01:38:16,930 --> 01:38:18,470
It only took two hours.

2682
01:38:21,050 --> 01:38:21,750
Oh, no!

2683
01:38:24,830 --> 01:38:25,310
Yes!

2684
01:38:29,190 --> 01:38:29,670
Yes!

2685
01:38:29,670 --> 01:38:29,770
Yes!

2686
01:38:29,970 --> 01:38:30,450
Yes!

2687
01:38:30,450 --> 01:38:30,930
Yes!

2688
01:38:31,150 --> 01:38:31,370
Yes!

2689
01:38:31,830 --> 01:38:32,310
Yes!

2690
01:38:32,310 --> 01:38:32,590
Yes!

2691
01:38:32,690 --> 01:38:32,930
But I finished the sign.

2692
01:38:32,930 --> 01:38:32,950
And I could not turn on the camera.

2693
01:38:33,730 --> 01:38:35,710
Oh, you killed the camera.

2694
01:38:35,710 --> 01:38:36,290
Get off camera.

2695
01:38:36,290 --> 01:38:37,050
That is so fucked.

2696
01:38:37,050 --> 01:38:37,070
You'reicasy.

2697
01:38:37,070 --> 01:38:37,530
That was killing her.

2698
01:38:40,990 --> 01:38:43,170
That's so fucked.

2699
01:38:43,890 --> 01:38:44,010
Yeah.

2700
01:38:48,750 --> 01:38:50,750
You are activated.

2701
01:38:51,250 --> 01:38:53,830
You're married to her.

2702
01:38:56,750 --> 01:38:58,190
You're so fucked.

2703
01:38:58,190 --> 01:39:00,650
God, you live in a window where there's nothing to see.

2704
01:39:01,750 --> 01:39:04,350
You are a freaky freaky girl.

2705
01:39:04,350 --> 01:39:07,590
You literally marinated Bao.

2706
01:39:10,270 --> 01:39:12,650
We never got her pizza sushi.

2707
01:39:14,210 --> 01:39:16,270
She would have made the pizza sushi.

2708
01:39:16,350 --> 01:39:17,150
Oh God.

2709
01:39:19,850 --> 01:39:21,710
You gave up on her.

2710
01:39:21,710 --> 01:39:24,330
You didn't believe in her enough to finish the task.

2711
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:25,630
You didn't believe in her.

2712
01:39:25,630 --> 01:39:28,530
No, God is my favorite ingredient in pizza sushi.

2713
01:39:29,350 --> 01:39:31,450
You didn't believe in her.

2714
01:39:32,590 --> 01:39:36,170
It's kind of hard when there's a screwdriver pointing at you.

2715
01:39:37,350 --> 01:39:39,910
The more pressure, the faster you go.

2716
01:39:45,870 --> 01:39:49,950
Guys, we can get...

2717
01:39:49,950 --> 01:39:53,690
Guys, we need to be able to get one win as an employee, guys.

2718
01:39:54,750 --> 01:39:56,450
In a normal game.

2719
01:39:56,970 --> 01:39:58,430
We can do it.

2720
01:39:58,530 --> 01:39:59,490
In a normal game.

2721
01:40:01,570 --> 01:40:02,690
I believe.

2722
01:40:02,970 --> 01:40:05,190
Guys, we can get one win.

2723
01:40:07,270 --> 01:40:08,250
It's not me.

2724
01:40:09,390 --> 01:40:10,390
It's not me.

2725
01:40:12,610 --> 01:40:14,150
It's totally not me.

2726
01:40:14,190 --> 01:40:16,670
Yeah, it's totally not us too.

2727
01:40:17,090 --> 01:40:17,730
Yeah.

2728
01:40:18,470 --> 01:40:19,850
What have we got?

2729
01:40:20,890 --> 01:40:22,530
Snuffy, where's the thing again?

2730
01:40:23,790 --> 01:40:24,750
Pizza sushi.

2731
01:40:25,410 --> 01:40:26,210
Oh no.

2732
01:40:26,210 --> 01:40:27,550
We gotta make some pizza sushi.

2733
01:40:31,450 --> 01:40:33,890
Are you going straight for the gun, Matara?

2734
01:40:34,190 --> 01:40:36,230
Are you going straight for the gun, Matara?

2735
01:40:36,230 --> 01:40:36,690
Are you going straight for the gun, Matara?

2736
01:40:36,690 --> 01:40:37,810
Matara, Matara, please.

2737
01:40:38,090 --> 01:40:38,490
Please.

2738
01:40:39,610 --> 01:40:40,130
Okay.

2739
01:40:41,330 --> 01:40:41,850
Okay.

2740
01:40:41,950 --> 01:40:43,010
I just won.

2741
01:40:44,190 --> 01:40:46,030
Oh my God, are you going straight for the gun?

2742
01:40:46,090 --> 01:40:48,410
Oh my God.

2743
01:40:48,430 --> 01:40:48,870
Oh my God.

2744
01:40:49,070 --> 01:40:49,970
Oh my God.

2745
01:40:53,530 --> 01:40:54,770
Alright, where is it?

2746
01:40:55,630 --> 01:40:57,130
Okay, just for protection.

2747
01:41:00,270 --> 01:41:02,990
I got the shank for protection.

2748
01:41:04,210 --> 01:41:05,430
Alright, let's see.

2749
01:41:07,310 --> 01:41:08,330
Where is it?

2750
01:41:09,290 --> 01:41:10,370
Where is the thing?

2751
01:41:10,690 --> 01:41:12,090
I found one of it.

2752
01:41:12,690 --> 01:41:14,290
Yeah, no, I found one of it.

2753
01:41:14,310 --> 01:41:15,110
But where's the other?

2754
01:41:15,450 --> 01:41:17,130
Where's the, like, activator?

2755
01:41:18,970 --> 01:41:25,310
What are you holding?

2756
01:41:25,570 --> 01:41:26,390
What the fuck is that?

2757
01:41:26,390 --> 01:41:27,210
You stay away from me.

2758
01:41:27,210 --> 01:41:28,290
What the fuck is that?

2759
01:41:29,250 --> 01:41:30,770
What the fuck is that?

2760
01:41:31,950 --> 01:41:32,890
What is that?

2761
01:41:33,690 --> 01:41:33,810
It's right.

2762
01:41:34,750 --> 01:41:35,490
It's right.

2763
01:41:39,330 --> 01:41:39,810
It's right.

2764
01:41:41,590 --> 01:41:43,230
I don't want to hurt anyone.

2765
01:41:43,550 --> 01:41:44,130
I don't want to hurt anyone.

2766
01:41:44,750 --> 01:41:47,370
I tried to make you pizza sushi.

2767
01:41:47,930 --> 01:41:49,590
It would be a shame if you can't.

2768
01:41:50,670 --> 01:41:51,150
Oh.

2769
01:41:52,470 --> 01:41:52,950
Oh.

2770
01:41:52,950 --> 01:41:54,450
Who is that?

2771
01:41:55,470 --> 01:41:56,630
Who is that?

2772
01:41:56,630 --> 01:41:57,310
Is that Rice?

2773
01:41:58,390 --> 01:41:59,550
Is that Rice?

2774
01:42:03,530 --> 01:42:04,310
Wait, what?

2775
01:42:05,890 --> 01:42:07,390
It's Navi and my...

2776
01:42:07,390 --> 01:42:08,210
Oh.

2777
01:42:09,530 --> 01:42:11,030
What the fuck?

2778
01:42:11,350 --> 01:42:12,410
There's always something.

2779
01:42:12,730 --> 01:42:13,890
There's always somebody.

2780
01:42:14,850 --> 01:42:17,850
I'm trying to find something important right now.

2781
01:42:18,590 --> 01:42:20,270
And I don't know where it is.

2782
01:42:20,590 --> 01:42:21,770
Is there a reason to keep going?

2783
01:42:21,850 --> 01:42:22,630
Because me too, buddy.

2784
01:42:22,950 --> 01:42:23,530
Yeah, it is.

2785
01:42:23,610 --> 01:42:24,010
It is.

2786
01:42:24,010 --> 01:42:26,410
It's a very good item that helps us win the game.

2787
01:42:26,810 --> 01:42:28,210
I'm trying to find it.

2788
01:42:29,830 --> 01:42:30,990
Where did it go?

2789
01:42:35,330 --> 01:42:36,930
Why did you try to hit me?

2790
01:42:37,210 --> 01:42:38,010
What the fuck?

2791
01:42:38,070 --> 01:42:39,770
Why did you try to slap me?

2792
01:42:39,990 --> 01:42:41,190
What the fuck?

2793
01:42:41,470 --> 01:42:44,750
I literally just walked in and he tried to slap me.

2794
01:42:45,630 --> 01:42:49,650
Wait, she's dead.

2795
01:42:51,670 --> 01:42:53,210
Where is that one?

2796
01:42:53,290 --> 01:42:54,390
The killer.

2797
01:42:54,430 --> 01:42:55,830
It's Navi.

2798
01:42:56,110 --> 01:42:56,790
Slaps.

2799
01:42:57,310 --> 01:42:58,470
Where is it?

2800
01:42:59,150 --> 01:43:00,150
Oh, okay.

2801
01:43:01,590 --> 01:43:02,270
Oh.

2802
01:43:04,790 --> 01:43:05,470
Alright.

2803
01:43:06,370 --> 01:43:07,050
Nice.

2804
01:43:08,130 --> 01:43:08,810
Alright.

2805
01:43:09,230 --> 01:43:10,650
We're almost there.

2806
01:43:13,210 --> 01:43:15,670
We need that one item.

2807
01:43:16,290 --> 01:43:17,730
Where is that?

2808
01:43:18,450 --> 01:43:19,370
Oh, wait.

2809
01:43:19,450 --> 01:43:19,630
What?

2810
01:43:19,650 --> 01:43:19,770
Wait.

2811
01:43:20,830 --> 01:43:23,130
Yeah, but we don't have the other piece of the puzzle.

2812
01:43:23,730 --> 01:43:24,970
I've been looking for it.

2813
01:43:25,030 --> 01:43:25,350
I know.

2814
01:43:26,110 --> 01:43:26,750
Me too.

2815
01:43:27,270 --> 01:43:27,810
Me too.

2816
01:43:27,850 --> 01:43:28,990
I'm trying to find it too.

2817
01:43:31,890 --> 01:43:33,030
Where is it?

2818
01:43:35,210 --> 01:43:36,290
Where is it?

2819
01:43:36,350 --> 01:43:37,310
I need to find it.

2820
01:43:37,850 --> 01:43:41,090
I need to find it so I can blow her up before she realizes.

2821
01:43:43,070 --> 01:43:46,990
I'm trying to find a very important item that will help us win the game.

2822
01:43:47,770 --> 01:43:49,110
I'm trying to find.

2823
01:43:50,370 --> 01:43:52,990
I'm trying to find a very important item.

2824
01:43:53,170 --> 01:43:53,570
I'm trying to find a very important item.

2825
01:43:53,590 --> 01:43:55,450
That will help us win the game.

2826
01:43:58,680 --> 01:43:59,280
That will help us win the game.

2827
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:00,080
There's no way!

2828
01:44:00,640 --> 01:44:01,240
I...

2829
01:44:01,240 --> 01:44:04,700
There's no one piece...

2830
01:44:04,700 --> 01:44:07,600
No one piece that will help us win!

2831
01:44:08,320 --> 01:44:09,780
No one piece that will help us win!

2832
01:44:11,970 --> 01:44:15,890
Alright, somebody took an item Alright, somebody took an item that's very important.

2833
01:44:16,370 --> 01:44:18,270
She's going to be accidentally murdering the whole lobby.

2834
01:44:19,950 --> 01:44:20,910
That's sus!

2835
01:44:21,250 --> 01:44:24,170
And I turned around and I was like, did you just try to shoot me?

2836
01:44:24,250 --> 01:44:24,590
Wait!

2837
01:44:24,710 --> 01:44:26,570
Matara told me that you were... What?

2838
01:44:27,010 --> 01:44:27,730
Matara's innocent!

2839
01:44:28,090 --> 01:44:28,990
Why is she dead?

2840
01:44:29,670 --> 01:44:31,030
They're having some problems.

2841
01:44:31,130 --> 01:44:32,190
They'll be fine, I'm sure.

2842
01:44:32,690 --> 01:44:34,410
Rin, do you have anything in your inventory?

2843
01:44:36,390 --> 01:44:38,230
Do you have anything in your inventory?

2844
01:44:38,750 --> 01:44:39,230
No?

2845
01:44:39,430 --> 01:44:39,870
Okay.

2846
01:44:40,090 --> 01:44:44,610
Cause like, I'm... I'm trying to find this one item that's very important.

2847
01:44:44,610 --> 01:44:48,070
That'll help us win the game, but I can't find it.

2848
01:44:49,670 --> 01:44:52,450
It's a very... It's a secret... Wait!

2849
01:44:52,630 --> 01:44:53,730
How did she die?

2850
01:44:55,130 --> 01:44:57,450
She tries to shoot me through a screwdriver.

2851
01:44:57,930 --> 01:44:58,990
A screwdriver?

2852
01:45:00,370 --> 01:45:01,930
Bro, what the fuck?

2853
01:45:01,930 --> 01:45:03,390
You performed a lobotomy?

2854
01:45:03,630 --> 01:45:04,270
That's fucked!

2855
01:45:05,010 --> 01:45:08,550
You just performed a lobotomy without a license!

2856
01:45:11,810 --> 01:45:13,230
Oh my god!

2857
01:45:14,610 --> 01:45:17,110
I'm still trying to find this very important item.

2858
01:45:17,670 --> 01:45:18,750
Oh, you have to clean it.

2859
01:45:18,890 --> 01:45:19,570
It's black.

2860
01:45:20,710 --> 01:45:21,170
Wonderful.

2861
01:45:24,190 --> 01:45:25,530
It's the washing machine!

2862
01:45:25,770 --> 01:45:26,890
It's the washing machine!

2863
01:45:29,290 --> 01:45:31,470
To the washing machine I go, I dare say.

2864
01:45:31,470 --> 01:45:32,970
I'll never find it.

2865
01:45:33,170 --> 01:45:33,350
Ah!

2866
01:45:33,370 --> 01:45:33,890
There, there, there!

2867
01:45:34,030 --> 01:45:34,290
There!

2868
01:45:34,410 --> 01:45:34,850
Right here.

2869
01:45:34,950 --> 01:45:35,770
You put it right here.

2870
01:45:36,030 --> 01:45:36,490
Okay.

2871
01:45:37,270 --> 01:45:37,730
Okay.

2872
01:45:38,230 --> 01:45:40,630
One day I'll find this very important item.

2873
01:45:40,830 --> 01:45:44,590
I will not give up until I find this very important item.

2874
01:45:44,610 --> 01:45:44,950
I will not give up until I find this very important item.

2875
01:45:46,430 --> 01:45:48,010
I will not give up!

2876
01:45:48,310 --> 01:45:48,950
Oh, hey.

2877
01:45:51,930 --> 01:45:52,730
Where's my screwdriver?

2878
01:45:53,910 --> 01:45:55,430
Did I drop it?

2879
01:45:55,970 --> 01:45:57,810
Where the fuck did I put my screwdriver?

2880
01:45:59,250 --> 01:46:00,090
Wait a minute.

2881
01:46:00,590 --> 01:46:01,990
I was holding a screwdriver.

2882
01:46:03,530 --> 01:46:04,650
What the fuck happened?

2883
01:46:07,090 --> 01:46:09,690
Oh my god, where did I even put it?

2884
01:46:10,390 --> 01:46:11,830
Where did I put my screwdriver?

2885
01:46:15,310 --> 01:46:15,990
Screwdriver?

2886
01:46:17,170 --> 01:46:19,350
Where the fuck is the detonator?

2887
01:46:23,630 --> 01:46:24,690
Oh my god.

2888
01:46:25,450 --> 01:46:27,090
I can't find it!

2889
01:46:27,770 --> 01:46:29,410
I can't find anything!

2890
01:46:31,430 --> 01:46:33,390
These are all batteries.

2891
01:46:37,150 --> 01:46:39,370
Now there's no screwdrivers?

2892
01:46:40,910 --> 01:46:41,590
Okay.

2893
01:46:41,850 --> 01:46:43,370
I must find something.

2894
01:46:43,830 --> 01:46:44,870
It's so quiet.

2895
01:46:44,950 --> 01:46:46,430
I'm pretty sure all the traders are dead.

2896
01:46:47,230 --> 01:46:48,330
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

2897
01:46:49,250 --> 01:46:50,970
They all have to be dead by now.

2898
01:46:51,550 --> 01:46:53,210
So it's just us completing tasks.

2899
01:46:53,370 --> 01:46:54,090
But we have eight minutes.

2900
01:46:54,190 --> 01:46:54,810
So I'm fine.

2901
01:46:54,890 --> 01:46:55,690
I'm not too worried.

2902
01:46:56,370 --> 01:46:57,310
I'm trying to find it.

2903
01:46:57,350 --> 01:46:59,970
I've been trying to find this fucking detonator for 20 years.

2904
01:47:05,130 --> 01:47:07,610
If you look closer than a quick glance, you'll find it.

2905
01:47:08,090 --> 01:47:08,790
But where?

2906
01:47:09,690 --> 01:47:10,950
I looked everywhere!

2907
01:47:11,670 --> 01:47:12,390
Oh, hey, screwdriver.

2908
01:47:13,910 --> 01:47:14,290
Okay.

2909
01:47:14,370 --> 01:47:15,430
At least I can do my task.

2910
01:47:19,970 --> 01:47:21,630
Everybody's trying to figure out...

2911
01:47:22,810 --> 01:47:23,590
Where is it?

2912
01:47:23,710 --> 01:47:24,530
All right, guys.

2913
01:47:25,010 --> 01:47:26,210
Where's the detonator?

2914
01:47:26,550 --> 01:47:27,010
Chat.

2915
01:47:28,270 --> 01:47:29,410
Chat, you guys know.

2916
01:47:29,690 --> 01:47:31,310
You guys have better eyes than me.

2917
01:47:31,530 --> 01:47:32,470
Wait, where was the...

2918
01:47:32,470 --> 01:47:36,390
Where was the vent that I saw earlier that needed to be vented?

2919
01:47:38,050 --> 01:47:39,070
What the fuck?

2920
01:47:40,130 --> 01:47:40,870
Oh, we're finished.

2921
01:47:41,190 --> 01:47:41,450
Nice.

2922
01:47:41,750 --> 01:47:43,210
Oh, it's pizza sushi time.

2923
01:47:43,870 --> 01:47:44,330
Okay.

2924
01:47:45,430 --> 01:47:46,270
God damn it.

2925
01:47:46,470 --> 01:47:47,390
It's where?

2926
01:47:47,750 --> 01:47:50,150
It has a chance to not spawn?

2927
01:47:50,570 --> 01:47:52,570
We just lost the 50...

2928
01:47:52,570 --> 01:47:53,250
Oh, my God.

2929
01:47:53,290 --> 01:47:54,250
We lost the 50-50.

2930
01:47:54,510 --> 01:47:59,590
We lost the 50-50.

2931
01:47:59,730 --> 01:48:01,450
It just doesn't spawn.

2932
01:48:01,870 --> 01:48:04,210
It literally doesn't.

2933
01:48:06,010 --> 01:48:06,950
Wait, what?

2934
01:48:08,430 --> 01:48:09,650
Is everything okay?

2935
01:48:10,370 --> 01:48:11,990
We're making pizza sushi.

2936
01:48:12,290 --> 01:48:12,810
Yay!

2937
01:48:13,750 --> 01:48:14,950
No, there's self-defense.

2938
01:48:14,950 --> 01:48:15,410
There's self-defense.

2939
01:48:15,430 --> 01:48:16,610
There's a self-defense.

2940
01:48:16,630 --> 01:48:17,130
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2941
01:48:17,130 --> 01:48:17,850
Self-defense.

2942
01:48:17,850 --> 01:48:18,570
Self-defense.

2943
01:48:18,570 --> 01:48:19,290
Look, look, look.

2944
01:48:19,530 --> 01:48:19,870
It's tuna.

2945
01:48:21,330 --> 01:48:22,470
It's self-defense.

2946
01:48:22,650 --> 01:48:24,950
Why fry tuna for one second?

2947
01:48:25,530 --> 01:48:26,050
Wait.

2948
01:48:26,350 --> 01:48:27,470
I'll do you tuna pizza.

2949
01:48:27,470 --> 01:48:27,950
Stay away from me.

2950
01:48:27,950 --> 01:48:28,290
Wait.

2951
01:48:28,290 --> 01:48:29,130
Press it.

2952
01:48:29,150 --> 01:48:29,710
Do it.

2953
01:48:29,890 --> 01:48:30,950
How do you clean a container?

2954
01:48:30,990 --> 01:48:31,330
Press one.

2955
01:48:31,410 --> 01:48:31,950
Press it.

2956
01:48:32,530 --> 01:48:33,170
Oh, wait.

2957
01:48:33,190 --> 01:48:33,750
No, that's a screwdriver.

2958
01:48:35,930 --> 01:48:38,290
I thought it was something else.

2959
01:48:40,230 --> 01:48:42,790
I thought it was something else.

2960
01:48:44,050 --> 01:48:45,190
Oh, my God.

2961
01:48:45,190 --> 01:48:45,410
Oh, my God.

2962
01:48:45,890 --> 01:48:46,670
Wait, wait, wait.

2963
01:48:46,710 --> 01:48:47,490
Okay, come over here.

2964
01:48:47,570 --> 01:48:48,310
I want to show you something.

2965
01:48:50,330 --> 01:48:51,010
Oh, it's this.

2966
01:48:52,210 --> 01:48:53,050
We got to clean it.

2967
01:48:53,170 --> 01:48:53,510
Oh, I see it.

2968
01:48:53,730 --> 01:48:54,530
I see it.

2969
01:48:54,550 --> 01:48:54,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2970
01:48:54,990 --> 01:48:55,530
I see it.

2971
01:48:55,690 --> 01:48:57,850
And then it was...

2972
01:48:58,450 --> 01:48:59,350
What was it?

2973
01:49:01,110 --> 01:49:01,450
This is cool rice.

2974
01:49:01,550 --> 01:49:02,330
That's not white rice.

2975
01:49:02,390 --> 01:49:03,010
That's cool rice.

2976
01:49:03,130 --> 01:49:03,950
That's a different color.

2977
01:49:04,150 --> 01:49:05,730
There's different colors of rice?

2978
01:49:07,310 --> 01:49:07,990
Oh, buddy.

2979
01:49:08,070 --> 01:49:09,010
Don't get me started.

2980
01:49:09,010 --> 01:49:09,370
There is...

2981
01:49:09,370 --> 01:49:09,830
Wait, how...

2982
01:49:09,830 --> 01:49:10,030
What?

2983
01:49:10,710 --> 01:49:12,270
This is why I don't do pizza sushi.

2984
01:49:12,670 --> 01:49:13,050
Wait, wait.

2985
01:49:13,050 --> 01:49:13,550
I'll show you something.

2986
01:49:13,690 --> 01:49:14,150
Jerry, come here.

2987
01:49:15,050 --> 01:49:15,390
Oh, buddy.

2988
01:49:17,050 --> 01:49:17,530
Oh, you're getting like...

2989
01:49:17,530 --> 01:49:17,970
You know, trust me.

2990
01:49:21,630 --> 01:49:22,590
Ev, there's...

2991
01:49:22,590 --> 01:49:23,510
Why don't you trust me?

2992
01:49:23,610 --> 01:49:24,430
Behind your eyes.

2993
01:49:24,710 --> 01:49:25,110
Why...

2994
01:49:25,110 --> 01:49:25,130
You...

2995
01:49:25,130 --> 01:49:25,330
What?

2996
01:49:25,450 --> 01:49:25,690
Something.

2997
01:49:25,770 --> 01:49:26,710
There's something wrong.

2998
01:49:26,790 --> 01:49:27,870
Why don't you trust me?

2999
01:49:27,970 --> 01:49:28,890
You should trust.

3000
01:49:28,910 --> 01:49:29,310
There's something wrong.

3001
01:49:29,310 --> 01:49:29,850
I'm really.

3002
01:49:30,110 --> 01:49:30,610
I'm looking for something.

3003
01:49:30,610 --> 01:49:30,830
Okay.

3004
01:49:30,850 --> 01:49:33,010
I can spell employee backwards.

3005
01:49:33,350 --> 01:49:33,710
You're a demon.

3006
01:49:33,710 --> 01:49:36,470
E-e-y-o-l-b-m-e.

3007
01:49:36,650 --> 01:49:37,110
You're a demon.

3008
01:49:37,110 --> 01:49:37,650
I'm literally...

3009
01:49:37,650 --> 01:49:39,290
You get to spell employee backwards.

3010
01:49:39,830 --> 01:49:40,170
Sorry.

3011
01:49:40,670 --> 01:49:41,270
I'm rolling in circles.

3012
01:49:43,370 --> 01:49:44,210
Mom, are you wanted?

3013
01:49:44,210 --> 01:49:45,290
Spell employee backwards.

3014
01:49:45,750 --> 01:49:48,010
E-E-Y-O-L-P.

3015
01:49:48,410 --> 01:49:49,030
What do you mean?

3016
01:49:49,070 --> 01:49:49,790
Look at your top right.

3017
01:49:49,910 --> 01:49:50,970
What does your top right say?

3018
01:49:51,590 --> 01:49:52,510
It says employee.

3019
01:49:52,910 --> 01:49:53,870
Then you're a fucking idiot.

3020
01:49:57,730 --> 01:50:00,750
You're a fucking idiot.

3021
01:50:08,350 --> 01:50:09,230
That's amazing.

3022
01:50:09,390 --> 01:50:09,750
That's amazing.

3023
01:50:10,010 --> 01:50:10,910
You can spell it backwards.

3024
01:50:12,490 --> 01:50:13,950
I have eyes.

3025
01:50:17,030 --> 01:50:17,910
Thank you.

3026
01:50:19,170 --> 01:50:20,050
Yeah, exactly.

3027
01:50:21,670 --> 01:50:22,630
Oh, okay.

3028
01:50:22,670 --> 01:50:23,070
I'm over here.

3029
01:50:23,110 --> 01:50:23,510
Come over here.

3030
01:50:23,770 --> 01:50:24,770
I want to show you something.

3031
01:50:29,400 --> 01:50:30,460
You know what this is?

3032
01:50:32,160 --> 01:50:33,040
The bomb?

3033
01:50:33,380 --> 01:50:34,180
Yeah, pick it up.

3034
01:50:35,420 --> 01:50:35,860
Okay.

3035
01:50:39,020 --> 01:50:41,420
It doesn't work because there's no detonator.

3036
01:50:42,240 --> 01:50:42,680
Oh.

3037
01:50:42,780 --> 01:50:43,220
Yeah.

3038
01:50:43,340 --> 01:50:44,800
It doesn't matter.

3039
01:50:45,060 --> 01:50:46,280
It doesn't matter.

3040
01:50:47,620 --> 01:50:49,620
But I can be a detonator.

3041
01:50:54,360 --> 01:50:55,700
If I can...

3042
01:50:55,700 --> 01:50:56,640
I'm innocent.

3043
01:50:56,780 --> 01:50:57,420
I'm an employee.

3044
01:50:57,840 --> 01:51:00,420
E-E-Y-O-L-P-M-E.

3045
01:51:00,620 --> 01:51:01,260
I'm an employee.

3046
01:51:02,500 --> 01:51:05,260
I just wanted to show her the C4.

3047
01:51:07,280 --> 01:51:10,740
Did you just spell employee the right way around?

3048
01:51:10,920 --> 01:51:11,360
Yeah.

3049
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:12,300
It's because I'm just...

3050
01:51:12,300 --> 01:51:13,420
He's expelling checks.

3051
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:14,600
He's expelling checks.

3052
01:51:14,600 --> 01:51:15,720
Then you know I'm employee.

3053
01:51:17,160 --> 01:51:21,840
Then you know if I was a traitor, I wouldn't be able to spell it.

3054
01:51:23,980 --> 01:51:25,040
Spell it backwards.

3055
01:51:25,340 --> 01:51:28,200
E-E-Y-O-L-P-M-E.

3056
01:51:28,660 --> 01:51:29,220
Employee.

3057
01:51:36,280 --> 01:51:37,660
We did it.

3058
01:51:37,860 --> 01:51:38,780
I made a total mistake.

3059
01:51:39,100 --> 01:51:39,520
Wait.

3060
01:51:39,560 --> 01:51:39,960
Don't you...

3061
01:51:39,960 --> 01:51:42,140
Did the C4 kill me or did you shoot me in the back?

3062
01:51:42,140 --> 01:51:43,500
I shot you in the back.

3063
01:51:46,740 --> 01:51:48,020
I made it.

3064
01:51:48,260 --> 01:51:49,300
I wanted you to think...

3065
01:51:49,300 --> 01:51:49,800
You're evil.

3066
01:51:50,540 --> 01:51:51,020
Evil.

3067
01:51:51,300 --> 01:51:55,100
I wanted you to think it was the C4.

3068
01:52:00,440 --> 01:52:02,740
She thought it was the C4.

3069
01:52:03,460 --> 01:52:03,940
Guys!

3070
01:52:04,520 --> 01:52:05,000
Wait.

3071
01:52:05,100 --> 01:52:05,980
Who was the traitor?

3072
01:52:06,480 --> 01:52:07,360
Who was the traitor?

3073
01:52:07,740 --> 01:52:09,080
So, it was me.

3074
01:52:09,220 --> 01:52:11,500
And my very first kill, I took the gun out.

3075
01:52:11,500 --> 01:52:13,220
And instead, I wanted to shoot...

3076
01:52:13,220 --> 01:52:14,200
I think I was trying to shoot you.

3077
01:52:14,480 --> 01:52:16,640
I... I... I pointed it at your back.

3078
01:52:16,720 --> 01:52:19,420
And instead of getting fired, I threw it over your shoulder.

3079
01:52:22,220 --> 01:52:23,500
Oh, that's really nothing.

3080
01:52:24,380 --> 01:52:27,240
I saw the gun come out and then she shot you.

3081
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:28,160
Wait.

3082
01:52:28,220 --> 01:52:29,320
Then how did you die?

3083
01:52:30,380 --> 01:52:32,080
And then she picked it up and she went blind.

3084
01:52:32,400 --> 01:52:33,520
And I couldn't tell.

3085
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:33,520
It was an excuse.

3086
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:34,900
Something was sticking in my eye.

3087
01:52:35,080 --> 01:52:37,580
And then she shot me.

3088
01:52:38,680 --> 01:52:39,080
Wait.

3089
01:52:39,200 --> 01:52:40,260
How did you die though?

3090
01:52:40,580 --> 01:52:41,640
I didn't...

3091
01:52:41,640 --> 01:52:42,360
Shoot me then!

3092
01:52:42,920 --> 01:52:43,520
Snoopy!

3093
01:52:43,940 --> 01:52:44,540
Snoopy, why?

3094
01:52:44,540 --> 01:52:46,960
The person I tried to shoot picked it up and went...

3095
01:52:46,960 --> 01:52:47,620
What the...

3096
01:52:50,620 --> 01:52:51,220
Alright.

3097
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:52,440
Alright, guys.

3098
01:52:53,120 --> 01:52:54,560
You guys want to do LG?

3099
01:52:55,560 --> 01:52:56,160
LG?

3100
01:52:56,800 --> 01:52:57,680
Last game.

3101
01:52:57,760 --> 01:52:58,180
Last game.

3102
01:52:59,000 --> 01:52:59,300
Everybody.

3103
01:53:00,280 --> 01:53:01,620
Last game, everybody.

3104
01:53:01,800 --> 01:53:02,620
Last game.

3105
01:53:04,160 --> 01:53:04,760
Okay.

3106
01:53:05,420 --> 01:53:06,800
We can do this.

3107
01:53:06,900 --> 01:53:07,660
Last game.

3108
01:53:08,480 --> 01:53:09,080
Alright.

3109
01:53:09,080 --> 01:53:09,100
Alright.

3110
01:53:09,320 --> 01:53:10,180
Let me see.

3111
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:10,800
Alright.

3112
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:12,820
We can...

3113
01:53:12,820 --> 01:53:14,040
I believe in us.

3114
01:53:14,120 --> 01:53:15,180
I believe in us.

3115
01:53:15,200 --> 01:53:15,640
GG.

3116
01:53:15,640 --> 01:53:16,560
Good luck, everybody.

3117
01:53:21,780 --> 01:53:23,140
Last game.

3118
01:53:23,180 --> 01:53:23,720
Last game.

3119
01:53:24,720 --> 01:53:25,960
Glad we figured...

3120
01:53:25,960 --> 01:53:28,400
I've been employee every game.

3121
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:33,220
I've got it like 500 times.

3122
01:53:34,140 --> 01:53:34,420
She...

3123
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:35,380
Poor pass.

3124
01:53:35,580 --> 01:53:36,360
Poor pass.

3125
01:53:36,380 --> 01:53:38,120
I can't believe it.

3126
01:53:39,100 --> 01:53:39,620
Okay.

3127
01:53:39,780 --> 01:53:40,620
Four tasks.

3128
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:42,580
Pressure is one of them.

3129
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:44,280
Pressure.

3130
01:53:45,320 --> 01:53:45,840
Alright.

3131
01:53:48,260 --> 01:53:48,780
Alright.

3132
01:53:50,200 --> 01:53:50,720
Pressure.

3133
01:53:53,840 --> 01:53:54,360
Alright.

3134
01:53:55,340 --> 01:53:56,960
I will find the thing.

3135
01:53:57,580 --> 01:53:59,140
I will find it.

3136
01:53:59,240 --> 01:53:59,860
It's nothing.

3137
01:53:59,960 --> 01:54:01,120
We have to find the thing.

3138
01:54:03,900 --> 01:54:04,720
We won these.

3139
01:54:05,160 --> 01:54:05,680
Okay.

3140
01:54:05,700 --> 01:54:06,400
We win these.

3141
01:54:06,420 --> 01:54:07,660
We win these.

3142
01:54:07,800 --> 01:54:08,100
That's it.

3143
01:54:08,100 --> 01:54:10,020
We won these!

3144
01:54:10,980 --> 01:54:11,600
Oh, hey.

3145
01:54:13,060 --> 01:54:14,840
Okay, we gotta get that for protection.

3146
01:54:15,520 --> 01:54:16,820
I don't trust nobody.

3147
01:54:17,720 --> 01:54:19,600
Oh wait, the shotgun's better actually.

3148
01:54:20,740 --> 01:54:21,180
Wait.

3149
01:54:22,460 --> 01:54:23,340
Let's just grab two.

3150
01:54:26,420 --> 01:54:26,860
Okay.

3151
01:54:29,620 --> 01:54:31,380
Yeah, but where is the...

3152
01:54:32,120 --> 01:54:32,980
Wait, did you...

3153
01:54:32,980 --> 01:54:33,860
Put it in the scanner.

3154
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:35,260
Put it in the scanner because they have to do scanner.

3155
01:54:37,320 --> 01:54:37,600
What?

3156
01:54:37,740 --> 01:54:37,820
What?

3157
01:54:37,960 --> 01:54:39,520
Put it in the scanner because they have to do the scanner.

3158
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:40,380
Oh, yeah.

3159
01:54:40,480 --> 01:54:41,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3160
01:54:42,340 --> 01:54:43,000
Wait, what is that?

3161
01:54:43,080 --> 01:54:43,820
Is it this room or this?

3162
01:54:43,880 --> 01:54:44,380
No, no, wait.

3163
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:44,840
Computers.

3164
01:54:44,840 --> 01:54:45,120
Wait, wait.

3165
01:54:45,140 --> 01:54:45,420
No, actually.

3166
01:54:45,520 --> 01:54:46,500
No, put it in the pressure room.

3167
01:54:46,520 --> 01:54:47,280
Put it in the pressure room.

3168
01:54:48,120 --> 01:54:49,240
While they're figuring out the pressure.

3169
01:54:49,480 --> 01:54:49,760
Okay, okay.

3170
01:54:49,820 --> 01:54:50,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3171
01:54:50,760 --> 01:54:51,860
I'm gonna do it really subtly.

3172
01:54:52,120 --> 01:54:52,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3173
01:54:53,720 --> 01:54:54,280
Really subtly.

3174
01:54:55,220 --> 01:54:56,040
Oh my god.

3175
01:54:56,860 --> 01:54:57,380
No, okay.

3176
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:00,280
I'm trying to find an...

3177
01:55:00,280 --> 01:55:00,840
Oh, hey.

3178
01:55:01,500 --> 01:55:02,300
I'm an employee.

3179
01:55:02,860 --> 01:55:03,620
E-E-Y.

3180
01:55:04,440 --> 01:55:05,200
E-E-Y.

3181
01:55:05,260 --> 01:55:07,040
Y-O-L-M-E.

3182
01:55:07,960 --> 01:55:08,600
Employee.

3183
01:55:11,040 --> 01:55:11,360
What?

3184
01:55:12,240 --> 01:55:12,880
Employee.

3185
01:55:12,920 --> 01:55:15,080
I spelled it correctly.

3186
01:55:17,240 --> 01:55:20,140
E-E-Y-O-L-M-E.

3187
01:55:22,100 --> 01:55:22,740
What?

3188
01:55:26,060 --> 01:55:26,700
Hello?

3189
01:55:27,480 --> 01:55:28,800
She misspelled employee.

3190
01:55:28,980 --> 01:55:29,740
She misspelled employee.

3191
01:55:29,880 --> 01:55:31,280
I swear to god she misspelled employee.

3192
01:55:31,600 --> 01:55:33,320
I swear to god she misspelled employee.

3193
01:55:33,580 --> 01:55:34,120
I stopped.

3194
01:55:35,260 --> 01:55:35,780
I stumbled.

3195
01:55:35,780 --> 01:55:36,480
You're in trouble.

3196
01:55:36,580 --> 01:55:40,240
I stumbled one time.

3197
01:55:40,840 --> 01:55:41,980
I stop.

3198
01:55:41,980 --> 01:55:42,260
I do.

3199
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:42,940
I do.

3200
01:55:42,940 --> 01:55:43,120
I do.

3201
01:55:43,120 --> 01:55:43,240
I do.

3202
01:55:43,240 --> 01:55:43,860
I do.

3203
01:55:43,860 --> 01:55:44,360
She misspelled.

3204
01:55:44,360 --> 01:55:45,020
I...

3205
01:55:45,020 --> 01:55:47,160
I spelled it right once.

3206
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:48,160
She actually misspelled employee.

3207
01:55:48,160 --> 01:55:49,020
I saw...

3208
01:55:49,020 --> 01:55:53,520
I just stumbled because I don't do well in the pressure.

3209
01:55:53,760 --> 01:55:55,800
I was getting chased.

3210
01:55:56,540 --> 01:55:57,800
I lost.

3211
01:55:57,800 --> 01:55:59,780
I was getting chased.

3212
01:56:00,240 --> 01:56:01,400
I lost.

3213
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:01,880
I lost.

3214
01:56:01,880 --> 01:56:02,000
I lost.

3215
01:56:02,140 --> 01:56:02,980
I lost.

3216
01:56:03,140 --> 01:56:03,600
I lost.

3217
01:56:03,740 --> 01:56:04,720
I lost.

3218
01:56:04,720 --> 01:56:05,540
That's not fair!

3219
01:56:05,660 --> 01:56:06,700
I was getting chased!

3220
01:56:06,780 --> 01:56:08,380
I thought I was gonna die!

3221
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:10,660
And I didn't die!

3222
01:56:12,600 --> 01:56:14,220
There's no dead in here!

3223
01:56:18,280 --> 01:56:20,660
Oh my god!

3224
01:56:20,760 --> 01:56:22,460
Oh no!

3225
01:56:25,340 --> 01:56:27,220
Oh my god!

3226
01:56:27,340 --> 01:56:30,740
I misspelled it one time!

3227
01:56:31,140 --> 01:56:33,060
One time!

3228
01:56:34,840 --> 01:56:36,560
Oh my god!

3229
01:56:37,360 --> 01:56:42,020
Did the detonator not... Did the detonator not spawn in again?

3230
01:56:42,540 --> 01:56:44,000
It's just guns!

3231
01:56:44,420 --> 01:56:46,560
Are you fucking kidding me?

3232
01:56:47,480 --> 01:56:49,040
Oh my god!

3233
01:56:49,200 --> 01:56:54,120
The detonator has not spawned in yet again!

3234
01:56:54,480 --> 01:56:56,260
That's actually crazy!

3235
01:56:58,640 --> 01:57:00,400
I can't believe it!

3236
01:57:00,420 --> 01:57:04,320
The most fun weapon hasn't spawned in again!

3237
01:57:06,440 --> 01:57:08,680
I didn't want to kill it right away!

3238
01:57:09,140 --> 01:57:11,440
I should've.

3239
01:57:11,620 --> 01:57:13,060
I fucking should've.

3240
01:57:13,700 --> 01:57:17,280
The world's deadliest spelling bee.

3241
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:19,700
That's life or death.

3242
01:57:20,100 --> 01:57:22,120
That spelling bee is life.

3243
01:57:22,260 --> 01:57:23,960
That's literally life or death.

3244
01:57:25,660 --> 01:57:26,500
Stop!

3245
01:57:26,680 --> 01:57:27,420
No!

3246
01:57:27,660 --> 01:57:28,280
Help!

3247
01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:30,600
Stop!

3248
01:57:31,560 --> 01:57:31,980
What?

3249
01:57:31,980 --> 01:57:32,780
Make sushi.

3250
01:57:32,840 --> 01:57:34,580
What the fuck's going on?

3251
01:57:35,640 --> 01:57:38,420
With my dying breath, I screamed, it's Bao.

3252
01:57:38,620 --> 01:57:40,680
And then immediately after I died, everyone went...

3253
01:57:40,680 --> 01:57:41,540
Wait, is it Bao?

3254
01:57:43,700 --> 01:57:50,760
I was spelling out employee, but I was getting chased by Mataya, and then she like...

3255
01:57:50,760 --> 01:57:51,800
That's a spelling mistake.

3256
01:57:52,080 --> 01:57:56,780
And then she killed me, cause I was... I was so stressed out.

3257
01:57:57,740 --> 01:58:01,720
I'm so glad no one asked me that, cause I'm dyslexic as hell.

3258
01:58:03,320 --> 01:58:04,160
Yes!

3259
01:58:04,420 --> 01:58:06,900
The evil has been defeated!

3260
01:58:09,600 --> 01:58:16,280
You know I'm illiterate, Mataya!

3261
01:58:18,840 --> 01:58:22,060
I got 99% correct!

3262
01:58:22,300 --> 01:58:23,500
That's like a pass!

3263
01:58:23,940 --> 01:58:24,780
No!

3264
01:58:24,900 --> 01:58:25,960
That's a pass!

3265
01:58:26,480 --> 01:58:26,860
I'm so sorry.

3266
01:58:27,260 --> 01:58:28,380
I'm so sorry.

3267
01:58:28,700 --> 01:58:29,700
Oh my god.

3268
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:31,960
99% is a pass.

3269
01:58:35,880 --> 01:58:37,060
I'm so sorry.

3270
01:58:37,080 --> 01:58:37,220
I'm so sorry.

3271
01:58:37,220 --> 01:58:38,200
You look so sad, Green.

3272
01:58:39,920 --> 01:58:45,160
Green got killed by... Green got killed by Bao, and she screamed, Bao, but no one believed it.

3273
01:58:45,960 --> 01:58:52,740
With my dying breath, I screamed, it's Bao!

3274
01:58:52,920 --> 01:58:55,500
Immediately after I died, I heard, could it be Bao?

3275
01:58:55,500 --> 01:58:56,260
Is it Bao, you think?

3276
01:58:57,780 --> 01:58:58,600
Is it Bao?

3277
01:58:58,600 --> 01:59:02,100
I could be a complete piece of luck right now, but I'm just gonna...

3278
01:59:02,100 --> 01:59:04,060
All I had was a screwdriver and a dream.

3279
01:59:04,260 --> 01:59:04,840
A dream.

3280
01:59:04,840 --> 01:59:04,940
A dream.

3281
01:59:04,940 --> 01:59:08,660
I'm souru classe.

3282
01:59:08,740 --> 01:59:10,500
Oh, is this a dream I have?

3283
01:59:10,500 --> 01:59:12,200
This ether is so stupid.

3284
01:59:12,880 --> 01:59:13,500
Like...

3285
01:59:17,820 --> 01:59:18,440
I'mston.

3286
01:59:19,520 --> 01:59:26,680
I understand this is Class 6, so you gotta actually click the point.

3287
01:59:28,900 --> 01:59:29,820
It's a cheat.

3288
01:59:30,660 --> 01:59:32,420
You're gonna look forward to it after this one.

3289
01:59:32,420 --> 01:59:33,760
I did not see it happening...

3290
01:59:33,760 --> 01:59:34,040
I was like...

3291
01:59:34,040 --> 01:59:34,120
Hello, um...

3292
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:37,280
No.

3293
01:59:37,360 --> 01:59:38,500
No, no, it can't be her.

3294
01:59:39,500 --> 01:59:41,940
It's a bow as she stands next to a dead body?

3295
01:59:49,440 --> 01:59:50,760
Oh, there's one more!

3296
01:59:51,020 --> 01:59:52,000
They're gonna win this!

3297
01:59:54,060 --> 01:59:54,540
Wait!

3298
01:59:54,540 --> 01:59:55,760
They're gonna win this!

3299
01:59:55,800 --> 01:59:56,140
Let's go!

3300
01:59:58,580 --> 01:59:59,740
They're gonna do it!

3301
02:00:02,300 --> 02:00:03,380
No, it's one killer.

3302
02:00:03,420 --> 02:00:05,720
I said it's a one cause two was just too many.

3303
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:14,160
Oh wait, they're doing it!

3304
02:00:14,560 --> 02:00:17,800
Wait guys, we're gonna win our second employee game!

3305
02:00:29,740 --> 02:00:30,280
I don't remember.

3306
02:00:30,420 --> 02:00:31,100
What do we do with that?

3307
02:00:31,300 --> 02:00:32,720
Oh, they're just trying to figure out.

3308
02:00:32,820 --> 02:00:33,460
They don't know what to do.

3309
02:00:34,440 --> 02:00:35,360
Get a new battery!

3310
02:00:37,800 --> 02:00:38,960
Snuffy just ran off alone.

3311
02:00:39,240 --> 02:00:40,800
I hope that's not the last time we see her.

3312
02:00:41,600 --> 02:00:42,140
Oh dear.

3313
02:00:44,420 --> 02:00:45,220
We'll find out.

3314
02:00:45,320 --> 02:00:46,660
I have a different battery!

3315
02:00:47,780 --> 02:00:48,520
Oh, okay.

3316
02:00:48,740 --> 02:00:49,300
This is it.

3317
02:00:50,200 --> 02:00:51,320
Wait, are these both dead?

3318
02:00:51,460 --> 02:00:52,340
No, they're the same.

3319
02:00:52,440 --> 02:00:53,680
She put the same battery in!

3320
02:00:53,940 --> 02:00:54,860
She put the same...

3321
02:00:54,860 --> 02:00:56,760
Are we dead or are we misunderstanding the plot?

3322
02:00:57,560 --> 02:00:57,920
Yay!

3323
02:01:03,540 --> 02:01:04,960
We did it!

3324
02:01:06,380 --> 02:01:07,280
We did it!

3325
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:09,560
We won!

3326
02:01:16,440 --> 02:01:18,680
I'm so proud of all of us guys.

3327
02:01:18,840 --> 02:01:21,900
It only took us two hours to figure out the task.

3328
02:01:25,520 --> 02:01:26,080
Yeah!

3329
02:01:26,080 --> 02:01:27,460
Two hours!

3330
02:01:31,760 --> 02:01:32,520
Guys!

3331
02:01:33,600 --> 02:01:43,500
Even though we're chronically online, if we have two hours, we can survive on an abandoned island.

3332
02:01:44,020 --> 02:01:44,780
Yay!

3333
02:01:47,760 --> 02:01:48,840
Yeah, yeah.

3334
02:01:49,640 --> 02:01:52,580
I'm so proud of all of us.

3335
02:01:52,620 --> 02:01:53,260
That was fun!

3336
02:01:53,400 --> 02:01:54,540
Thank you everybody for joining!

3337
02:01:55,340 --> 02:01:56,100
Yay!

3338
02:01:59,740 --> 02:02:00,140
Thank you!

3339
02:02:00,140 --> 02:02:01,220
Thank you everybody!

3340
02:02:01,880 --> 02:02:02,340
Thank you!

3341
02:02:02,440 --> 02:02:03,000
Yipee!

3342
02:02:07,440 --> 02:02:08,160
Yay!

3343
02:02:13,480 --> 02:02:17,420
Thank you everybody for coming to the collab!

3344
02:02:17,640 --> 02:02:18,640
You guys had fun!

3345
02:02:20,100 --> 02:02:21,120
Bye everybody!

3346
02:02:22,140 --> 02:02:23,020
Bye bye!

3347
02:02:23,900 --> 02:02:25,220
I can't leave!

3348
02:02:25,420 --> 02:02:26,300
How do I get out?

3349
02:02:26,460 --> 02:02:27,440
You just quit.

3350
02:02:28,140 --> 02:02:29,720
I just leave.

3351
02:02:29,720 --> 02:02:30,280
Leave the lobby.

3352
02:02:31,640 --> 02:02:32,760
Goodbye guys!

3353
02:02:33,140 --> 02:02:35,020
Have fun with your streams and your days!

3354
02:02:35,560 --> 02:02:36,160
You are so good at tasks.

3355
02:02:36,540 --> 02:02:37,600
Yeah, she is.

3356
02:02:37,800 --> 02:02:42,100
I need you on like any teamwork team.

3357
02:02:42,320 --> 02:02:43,760
Any team that requires thinking.

3358
02:02:44,140 --> 02:02:44,540
This is great, my ego.

3359
02:02:44,660 --> 02:02:44,960
Thank you.

3360
02:02:46,360 --> 02:02:47,680
You for shooting.

3361
02:02:47,800 --> 02:02:48,620
You for thinking.

3362
02:02:49,560 --> 02:02:51,060
No, you're the shooter.

3363
02:02:51,240 --> 02:02:52,600
You shoot without reason.

3364
02:02:54,780 --> 02:02:56,560
You don't ask questions.

3365
02:02:56,600 --> 02:02:57,320
I hesitate.

3366
02:02:57,320 --> 02:02:58,280
You don't.

3367
02:03:01,600 --> 02:03:02,940
I'm like, could she?

3368
02:03:03,160 --> 02:03:04,000
Should I do it?

3369
02:03:04,100 --> 02:03:04,780
But you're like, no.

3370
02:03:10,040 --> 02:03:10,760
Bye guys!

3371
02:03:11,020 --> 02:03:12,260
Thanks for inviting me.

3372
02:03:13,360 --> 02:03:14,960
Thanks for subbing, Indrin!

3373
02:03:15,260 --> 02:03:15,800
I really appreciate it.

3374
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:16,540
We had a great time.

3375
02:03:17,380 --> 02:03:18,740
Thank you for having me.

3376
02:03:18,880 --> 02:03:21,440
I have no idea how I got here, but I appreciate it.

3377
02:03:21,700 --> 02:03:22,980
Yeah, I hope it was okay.

3378
02:03:23,040 --> 02:03:24,100
I know it was a little bit overwhelming.

3379
02:03:24,340 --> 02:03:25,520
But I hope you still had fun.

3380
02:03:27,320 --> 02:03:28,020
But you know what?

3381
02:03:28,260 --> 02:03:33,020
I hope you had a great day.

3382
02:03:33,140 --> 02:03:33,920
I'll see you later.

3383
02:03:34,200 --> 02:03:34,660
Bye!

3384
02:03:35,160 --> 02:03:36,280
Thank you very much.

3385
02:03:36,380 --> 02:03:37,140
I will see you.

3386
02:03:37,240 --> 02:03:38,560
Once I figure out how the...

3387
02:03:38,560 --> 02:03:39,360
Oh, it's the Quit Lobby.

3388
02:03:39,440 --> 02:03:40,420
Bye bye.

3389
02:03:44,040 --> 02:03:45,220
Alright, that's fun!

3390
02:03:45,500 --> 02:03:48,240
I actually had a great time with all the ladies today.

3391
02:03:48,400 --> 02:03:50,800
It was very chaotic in the beginning.

3392
02:03:50,900 --> 02:03:52,940
But we started getting to know each other.

3393
02:03:53,200 --> 02:03:56,460
And everybody started figuring out how to play the game.

3394
02:03:57,320 --> 02:04:01,080
The biggest issue was that we were just like, how do you play this game?

3395
02:04:01,200 --> 02:04:02,900
How do you do the task?

3396
02:04:03,140 --> 02:04:10,300
Like, seven plus VTubers trying to figure out one task.

3397
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:16,020
But I had a great time.

3398
02:04:16,200 --> 02:04:17,660
It was honestly very fun.

3399
02:04:19,240 --> 02:04:20,940
Very fun playing this game.

3400
02:04:21,120 --> 02:04:23,280
I'm happy with the group we got in the end.

3401
02:04:23,820 --> 02:04:25,800
And it was very chaotic.

3402
02:04:26,080 --> 02:04:27,780
It was very chaotic in the beginning.

3403
02:04:27,960 --> 02:04:29,380
But we slowly got...

3404
02:04:29,380 --> 02:04:35,980
We slowly listened to everybody and figured the game out very slowly.

3405
02:04:36,500 --> 02:04:38,540
But we still figured out the game.

3406
02:04:38,680 --> 02:04:41,780
How many VTubers does it take to change a generator?

3407
02:04:42,280 --> 02:04:43,880
Just like...

3408
02:04:44,820 --> 02:04:46,320
Lime and Reddit.

3409
02:04:49,340 --> 02:04:51,640
Seven VTubers and one...

3410
02:04:51,640 --> 02:04:54,640
No, it's one brain cell between all of us.

3411
02:04:54,660 --> 02:04:55,880
That's for sure.

3412
02:04:58,480 --> 02:05:01,360
But I had a great time.

3413
02:05:01,560 --> 02:05:04,440
I hope you guys had a great time watching as well.

3414
02:05:04,600 --> 02:05:07,740
And you enjoyed everybody's company.

3415
02:05:09,580 --> 02:05:10,600
I hope it was okay.

3416
02:05:10,640 --> 02:05:11,940
I didn't have any of the...

3417
02:05:11,940 --> 02:05:14,340
I hope you guys were able to figure out who's who.

3418
02:05:14,540 --> 02:05:16,400
If not, just enjoy the colors.

3419
02:05:18,840 --> 02:05:25,420
Enjoy the colors of everybody's because I know it might have been a bit disorienting trying to figure out who's who.

3420
02:05:25,960 --> 02:05:27,160
Who's talking and everybody.

3421
02:05:27,440 --> 02:05:30,080
But since we're using in-game voice chat, it wouldn't matter.

3422
02:05:30,160 --> 02:05:32,300
I use Discord overlays and stuff.

3423
02:05:33,220 --> 02:05:35,440
Since you guys won't even be able to see it.

3424
02:05:36,580 --> 02:05:39,400
So, I still hope you guys were able to figure out who's who.

3425
02:05:40,300 --> 02:05:42,060
Anyway, I'm going to rest here a little bit.

3426
02:05:42,100 --> 02:05:43,420
My voice is slowly dying.

3427
02:05:43,740 --> 02:05:45,860
So, I'm going to rest my voice before the second stream tonight.

3428
02:05:46,020 --> 02:05:47,280
I do have a second stream tonight.

3429
02:05:47,500 --> 02:05:50,360
I have a Goodnight Dragoons where I'm just going to hang out and chat with everybody.

3430
02:05:50,660 --> 02:05:52,640
So, I'm going to call it here, everyone.

3431
02:05:52,740 --> 02:05:56,880
I hope you guys check out all the VTubers, all the streamers that were playing with us today.

3432
02:05:58,220 --> 02:06:04,520
And I hope that you had a great time watching.

3433
02:06:04,640 --> 02:06:08,540
As always, everybody stay hydrated, posture checked, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3434
02:06:08,660 --> 02:06:11,460
And if you stay up for me, stay up a little longer for the second stream.

3435
02:06:11,580 --> 02:06:13,420
I'm going to make the waiting room the moment the stream is over.

3436
02:06:13,720 --> 02:06:17,200
Anyway, a huge shout-out again to all the ladies that joined us today.

3437
02:06:17,880 --> 02:06:21,440
We had... let me just make sure I read it off so I don't miss anybody.

3438
02:06:21,640 --> 02:06:23,900
We had... make sure you check them out.

3439
02:06:23,980 --> 02:06:30,680
We had Amelie, Bao, me, Juniper, Lamu, Matara, Rin, and Snuffy.

3440
02:06:30,760 --> 02:06:31,860
So, please check them out.

3441
02:06:32,080 --> 02:06:33,340
Anyway, I'll see you guys later.

3442
02:06:33,560 --> 02:06:34,120
Bye-bye!
