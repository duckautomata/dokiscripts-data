Thank you.

3
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,040
Oh shit.

4
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,080
Oh, I forgot.

5
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,120
Okay, sorry.

6
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,440
I might be on loading screen.

7
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,200
All right, there you go.

8
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,820
Hey, hello, everyone.

9
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,560
Hello.

10
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,940
Merry Christmas, everyone.

11
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,880
Merry Christmas.

12
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,120
Welcome to my Christmas party, guys.

13
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,740
I was like, I got everything set up.

14
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,640
Oh my, I'm so prepared.

15
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,720
And I looked, I was like, oh, I'm not moving.

16
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:38,160
As you guys see, I have custody of both the Twitch goons and
the YouTube goons right here.

17
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,660
custody of both of you guys at the same time.

18
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,100
It's very rare right here.

19
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,640
And I have to sit in the middle to make sure you guys do not
touch.

20
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,220
I have to make sure that you too do not touch or I will get
bad.

21
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,920
So I shall sit here in the middle in between you two.

22
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:03,920
Yeah, hello.

23
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,400
Merry Christmas, everyone.

24
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,860
Yes, we're doing multistream.

25
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:15,380
Uh, for the first time, well, I mean, I did do it for, um, I
think it was for Bandai, uh, but that was not on my channel.

26
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:22,320
This is the first time I had to do it on my channel, so it's
like, I, I, I've been, like, working on the stream stuff

27
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,780
since, for like, five to six hours.

28
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,240
Making sure everything is okay.

29
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,220
I don't want to get bad or anything.

30
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,300
Um, hands up, Twitch goods.

31
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,600
Fight, fight, fight, fight.

32
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,420
You're sipping on my, sipping.

33
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,820
on my eggnog watching my children fight each other during
Christmas.

34
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,600
What a wonderful holiday.

35
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,340
Like five feet apart because we're not allowed.

36
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,020
Because we're not gay.

37
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,080
Who's your favorite chat?

38
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,820
I love both children equally, guys.

39
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,020
I love you both equally.

40
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:07,400
Here.

41
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,920
I love both my children equally, guys.

42
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:24,360
Anyway, so for those who don't know, this is my first time
doing a multi-stream on both channels.

43
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,540
This is going to be a very rare occasion.

44
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,740
I will not be doing this very frequently or very often.

45
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,940
Maybe, like, for special events such as this.

46
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,200
Because I figured, you know, it's Christmas.

47
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:46,340
stream uh for today uh for those who are maybe spending the
holidays alone or you know they want end their christmas or

48
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:52,040
they want to start their christmas holiday with me uh you
drop in and out i'll be streaming i think at most i'll be

49
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:58,780
aiming for 11 hours so i'll be throughout the day you can
drop in or drop out whenever you want uh we do have a

50
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:07,640
schedule a christmas schedule also for some reason okay i
i've been trying to figure out like um what what plugin to

51
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:14,540
use for multi-chats that I can read, but it looks like the
YouTube one is overpowering the Twitch chatters.

52
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,940
Because I, so, because it's like all red, and I'm like,
where are the purple chat?

53
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:29,060
But then I swapped it, like, my dashboard on the Twitch
side, but I can see you guys chatting, but, like, the

54
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:33,380
YouTuber, the YouTube chat is, like, overtaking the entire
plugin.

55
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:47,480
As it's we need enforcement quick dragons um uh dial thank
you for the super chat thank you thank you it's not gay the

56
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:58,520
orbs don't touch um but yeah unless someone has oh i see it
i see someone i see someone i see um oh it was a re it was a

57
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:06,640
resub okay i still resub pushed through the barriers of you
too okay this is what i see okay i'll show you guys what i

58
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,740
see on my side it's so weird It's so weird doing multi.

59
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:16,080
I'm sure I've been like Googling everything to find out
figure out like What is the best like plug-in for

60
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,620
multi-chat, but like everybody gave like different answers
So I don't know.

61
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:27,480
I don't know which plug-in is the best for For like to read
both channels.

62
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:28,800
All right, here you go.

63
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:35,640
I'll show you guys what I see This poor guy Okay, here it
is.

64
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:44,380
Oh, yeah what I see on my side because I'm like where the
fuck are the twitch shatters and I turn her and I look over

65
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:55,820
to like the actual twitch dashboard and you guys are here
you guys are typing like it's just like he broke the barrier

66
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:04,960
oh shit here you go here I need to make sure you're not
covered too I need to make sure I forgot I can't cover up

67
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,520
twitch that

68
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:20,960
yeah oh wait oh twitch came oh my god it's overpowering now
oh you guys broke through for like one second no he guys

69
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:35,040
broke through for one second it got all purple for one
second uh no uh you can have both chats um on the same they

70
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:43,100
it's it's very okay i'll let you guys know this it's like
weird twitch has like these vague rules on purpose so that

71
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:52,020
they can like like pick and choose stuff like what they want
to like enforce and everything so basically um the rules are

72
00:07:52,020 --> 00:08:01,200
very hard to understand because they're so vague so and they
didn't update it i think but basically you can have both

73
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:10,060
chats on the screen but they just can't touch each other so
they can be like or like it's very distinguishable that, um,

74
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,120
it's very distinguishable that they're, they're like
different chats.

75
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:20,680
So you can see that the YouTube chat looks different from
the Twitch chat, uh, because if, if it wasn't allowed, then

76
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:26,840
all live YouTubers would have been banned off of Twitch
because they have both chats showing on their streams.

77
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:34,260
Um, and, and also like I've noticed like, that's why they're
like super, uh, super vague on purpose.

78
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,940
So they can like basically pick and choose what they want to
do.

79
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:48,840
um yeah so that's why like that's why like we can do this a
lot of vtubers would have been banned a lot of the

80
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:58,920
multi-stream vtubers would have been banned if um um if like
you know if i it wasn't allowed to have both chats

81
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,660
multi-streamed YouTubers also do both chats on the same on
the same screen.

82
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,380
They just have to it just has to be distinguishable.

83
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:15,920
Yeah.

84
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,920
It has to be like fucking distinguishable in between like
what is Twitch chat which is what is YouTube chat.

85
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,140
And look it is.

86
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:29,240
So if any staff is watching YouTube chat has a Santa hat.

87
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,860
Twitch chat has a I guess a Christmas hat with a little
Christmas tree.

88
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:45,040
switch and also twitch chat is sitting to my right and
youtube chat is sitting to my left and also they're also

89
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:53,080
different css codes so you cannot confuse them with each
other i've seen streamers who combine both yeah some of them

90
00:09:53,080 --> 00:10:02,760
got banned you're not allowed to combine both i was watching
a video of a semi big streamer and like not it wasn't like

91
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:10,700
super big he was like you know like streaming and he was
like oh yeah i thought i was allowed to have both chats

92
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:17,500
combined um but then i got i got a suspension so he's like
yeah don't do that guys i thought they wouldn't catch me but

93
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:26,600
they did like he's like i thought i wasn't big enough to get
caught but i did get caught so um so don't do it guys i was

94
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:33,760
like okay i need to make sure we don't combine them where
they don't touch each other uh w thank you for the akasupa

95
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,940
thank you thank you merry christmas toky and dragons thank
Thank you to the Akasupa.

96
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:38,260
Thank you.

97
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:38,840
Thank you.

98
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,520
Luffy, thank you for tier one.

99
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,500
So thank you.

100
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,580
This is like so confusing for me.

101
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,760
Kind of like thinking.

102
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:46,940
It's so weird.

103
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:51,740
I think like my multi-chat is like having trouble handling,
grabbing from both sides.

104
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,400
I'm just getting fucked.

105
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,380
Like, oh my gosh.

106
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,080
There has to be a better plug in for this.

107
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,200
No, it's okay.

108
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,140
It's okay.

109
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,780
It was like five seconds where I showed them combined, guys.

110
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,100
Look, see?

111
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,500
They're both sitting on opposite sides of each other.

112
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:16,780
But yeah, like I said, I want it to do, um, I want it, don't
worry, left side, now my Twitch chat is on my left monitor,

113
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,440
my YouTube chat is on my right monitor, so this is how I'm
going to distinguish.

114
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:30,480
I, I, it sucks that I can't have you all together for me to
look at, but, um, that you two are fighting each other, and,

115
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,700
uh, it depends on who is typing the most to break through
the barriers.

116
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,940
To thank you for the Twitch Prime, thank you, thank you.

117
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,060
Yeah, the multi-chats having a...

118
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,720
It's literally a fight right now.

119
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,500
It's like red versus blue right now on my multi-chat screen.

120
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,520
Let's see.

121
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,280
Bite size.

Timmy was abandoned for three years.

He doesn't count.

179
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,200
He's the first, Yemi.

180
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,700

181
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,680

00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,700
But I don't play favorites, guys.

185
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:32,400

game so if you're able to get into one of the games please

199
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:31,940
let other dragoons have a chance to join in on the games and
you guard timmy and yimmy you two are allowed to snitch on

200
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:39,340
each other so timmy if you see Yumi, uh, Yumi being in
another game, and you're like, wait, you were in the last

201
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,800
game, feel free to snitch on Yumi.

202
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:54,160
Timmy, you too, if you see, sorry, wait, Yumi, you too,

snitch on Timmy.

204
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,360
So, uh, just let me know, and then we'll kick them out.

205
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,100
We don't even look the same.

206
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,440
That's why I gave you, of course not.

207
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,440
That's why I gave you two different hats.

208
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,740
Guys, it's so I can distinguish between you two.

209
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,980
That's why I gave you two different hats.

210
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,260
So I know which is which.

211
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:29,980
I swear to God, parents who give their twins, like give
their twins slash triplets the same clothes.

212
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,520
Like, what the fuck is wrong with you?

213
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:40,140
like I don't know maybe they can tell who's who but still
like bro just give them different clothes like why do you

214
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:47,840
want them to match like it's already hard enough anyway uh
we're gonna go crash on some random free you know how

215
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,780
there's like Minecraft SMP servers that are free to join
we're gonna crash some of them well I'll try to look up some

216
00:20:52,780 --> 00:21:00,060
Minecraft servers and then we'll um we'll like we'll raid it
I don't know we'll play like we'll grab a Bedwars server or

217
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,540
something I want to play it.

218
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:08,300
Oh my I wish I could play like the Minecraft hunger game

streams to see which one is like has the lowest latency and

220
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:25,120
then stream snipe me I so most likely we will not do my
Minecraft hunger games, but I do want to do the oh my god I

221
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,300
want I want to go to the parkour civilization server.

222

said bad, Yimmy.

244
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,660
Santa's been busy using AI.

245
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,060
You think Rab grows on trees?

246
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,400
Yeah, Yimmy.

247
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,620
Even Santa?

248
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,480
Oh my god, did you guys see them?

249
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:32,480
Okay, I know like, you know, okay, like we all have our
opinions about AI, but I missed when AI was first being

250
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:38,880
introduced and people were just using that to like create
dumb fucking dumb shit like you know Like just dumb memes

251
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,100
and shitposts and stuff now.

252
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:49,260
It's like a little bit problematic But back then when AI was
starting, you know, like the fucking ash baby is actually AI

253
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:56,060
I loved how when people found out the ash baby meme was AI
and some like I remember I saw a tweet and people were like

254
00:24:56,060 --> 00:25:05,000
Would you do you really think they fucking burned a child
and Like, they buried, they buried a child, a real child is

255
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,300
ash.

256
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,060
A fucking course is AI.

257
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,220
Yes, it's AI.

258
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,600
It's, it's like AI.

259
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:14,520
They generate a bunch of babies, like, screaming in ash.

260
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:22,720
So, um, my world is a lot.

261
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,980
So, um, it could be, that is true.

262
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,960
It could be Photoshop, too.

263
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:43,880
Um, uh, but it what it is AI generated for those who don't
know um um but anyway so I thought it was really funny but

264
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:53,120
uh it is it is pretty problematic but I thought it was
really funny for Christmas time that parents are using AI to

265
00:25:53,120 --> 00:26:04,040
like to like generate Santa into their photos to fuck with
the children like some parent was like can't wait to tell

266
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:11,580
the children that they missed Santa and then they fucking
knew the AI generated Santa putting presents under the tree

267
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:20,440
yeah so they're like what it makes them believe in Santa
they're like oh my god Santa is fucking real Santa came and

268
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:29,100
freak brought presents down like I'd be so hurt yeah but the
child wouldn't know it's AI children don't know what AI is

269
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:42,900
and just stop all right i think it's better than what the i
don't know you guys remember this but i think okay i think

270
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:54,520
tricking children into believing in santa with ai is more
more is more morally okay than when parents were telling

271
00:26:54,520 --> 00:27:02,500
children that they didn't get them any christmas presents
and also when they ate all their candy and then have it all

272
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:06,580
filmed on camera and then sent over to Jimmy Fallon.

273
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:07,180
Or was it?

274
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,720
I think that is a lot worse.

275
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:22,080
Because that was a thing a couple of years ago where Jimmy
Fallon was like, parents, record yourself telling your kids

276
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,200
that they're not getting any Christmas presents this year.

277
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:33,560
And also that time when he was like, Parents record your
children record telling your children that you ate all their

278
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:44,200
Halloween candy And then it was broadcasted on national TV
everywhere and also YouTube groups too Yeah, yeah, and also

279
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:51,740
it has like millions of views on YouTube as well Like you
can literally look it up on YouTube right now.

280
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:58,400
It's like it's like Jimmy Fallon Halloween candy or some
shit And people were like, oh my god, it's so, I think, I

281
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:07,140
think tricking children and thinking Santa is real is a bit
better than the thing they did with Jimmy Fallon.

282
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:18,920
Like, it was, it was a lot, yeah, it's like the therapy is
going to be so expensive in the future for them.

283
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:36,870
It's what a Jimmy Someone was like maybe isn't it the other
Jimmy I got confused It really is really hard when like

284
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:45,390
Celebrities share the The same fucking name It's like the
Chris's It's like which Chris are you talking about Chris

285
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:55,250
Pat, Chris Evans Um Um The third Chris And the fourth Chris
I'm sorry I can't remember the third and fourth Chris On the

286
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,670
top of my head right now

287
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:11,020
I just remembered Pratt, Hemsworth, sorry, Chris Hemsworth,
to be fair, I feel like, no, he did do the, he did do the,

288
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:20,840
what movie was it, Furiosa movie, Mad Max movie recently, oh
yeah, Chris Tucker, Chris Brown, Chris Farley, Chris Evans,

289
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,620
I don't know why I said Evans like five times,

290
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:40,380
Did you know like Chris Rock isn't a, everybody hates Chris,
isn't a documentary about Chris Rock's life?

291
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,100
I, it blew my mind.

292
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:50,980
I was like, what do you mean Chris doesn't have a little,
like Chris doesn't have like, like Chris Rock's life isn't

293
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:54,020
like Chris, Chris Rock and everybody hates Chris.

294
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,240
I was like, what the fuck?

295
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,060
I felt like I had trust issues.

296
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:07,470
No, he made up family members, too, in the show.

297
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:11,290
I know.

298
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:13,450
We've all been lied, too.

299
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:16,170
Oh,

300
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:23,590
yeah.

301
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:25,750
And also, like, for the AI stuff.

302
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:28,450
Oh, wait.

303
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:29,350
I'll show you guys the photo.

304
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:30,730
Let me see if I, like, saved it.

305
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:32,270
It's actually pretty fucking funny.

306
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:35,930
Oh, here we go.

307
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:49,790
I was like I was like Oh my god That's so fucked up It's
like telling my children They just missed Santa And then

308
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:54,050
fucking AI generated And fucking Santa That's like crazy

309
00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:04,170
New ways to lie I'm sorry Yumi New ways to lie to your kids
Like Like

310
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,970
It looks so short.

311
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:19,390
There's another one.

312
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,890
Let's see.

313
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:26,290
I went with the ring doorbell.

314
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,430
Oh my god.

315
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:30,150
That's like crazy.

316
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:37,790
Look at this one.

317
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:42,030
Jeez, the eye is so fucking scary.

318
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:45,050
They fucking got a photo of their ring.

319
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:49,690
Ring camera and fucking AI generated Santa into the ring
camera shit.

320
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:51,010
That's fucking insane.

321
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,100
Santa in the home.

322
00:31:59,160 --> 00:31:59,740
Yeah, I know.

323
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,740
AI is so scary now.

324
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,380
Because it's always growing.

325
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:05,960
Yeah, I would fall.

326
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:08,980
Bro, if I was a child, I would fall for it too.

327
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,680
Like, that shit is so real.

328
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,640
Not not surreal.

329
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:19,500
Yeah, why would he go through the front door.

330
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,140
Is he stupid or something?

331
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,000
This is why we can't have Ram Bros.

332
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,640
Santa stole all the Ram.

333
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,660
stole all the Ram.

334
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,860
But this isn't worth the Ram's shortness.

335
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:48,340
Guys, I'm pretty sure it's not the parents AI generating
Santa.

336
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,800
That's fucking why.

337
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,020
the ram shortage

338
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:04,340
oh duck thank you for the twitch prime thank you thank you
chris thank you for the 10 gift of ships thank you thank you

339
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:14,240
yeah no i think so i think like like in a year or two um i
progressed so much i remember when people were like oh oh my

340
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:22,240
god did you see the crate okay did you see okay some of you
guys might not have seen this like uh drama um but i was so

341
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:28,980
curious about it because popped up on my for you page and
there was like this drama about like art tracing and like

342
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:42,520
apparently you can like you can like trace over like artwork
with green lines or something so when you record it uh the

343
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:53,460
green lines do not like trace over like ai art and then like
you can green screen um the line art if it's green and so it

344
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:57,040
won't show up in the recording and i was like what the

345
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:07,380
no it was showing up in my four you everyone was looking
talking about this shit and i was like what the fuck is

346
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:14,240
going on and then like and they were like here's how you do
it and literally this this guy was like all right so just so

347
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:22,260
just like overlay the thing you want to trace with So when
you're recording it, when you're recording the video, you're

348
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:29,700
drawing this thing, you can, like, it will not show, it will
not show up because it's green, because the camera will

349
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,580
delete the green from your footage.

350
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,520
And I'm like, what the fuck?

351
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,440
Fucking my day.

352
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,680
You just hide the, you just hide the layer.

353
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:48,500
But now, now there's fucking, now you can like just record,
like, delete the green.

354
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,820
off of your footage?

355
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:54,520
Like, that's so fucking complicated.

356
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,250
That's crazy.

357
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:05,730
That's so much effort just to, like, not get, trying to not
get caught.

358
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,800
Yeah, they just chroma keyed it out.

359
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:24,220
No, it's basically like they, okay, so like, you know how
regular tracing you just like you just like get a file you

360
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:30,220
want to you get like an artwork you want to trace and then
turn the opacity down and then just like draw on top of it

361
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:38,100
so what people do now which is incredible like which is like
it's like apparently a super common thing too uh because

362
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:45,020
usually when they're like oh show proof that you drew this
thing they'll like record themselves drawing it so um so

363
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:55,020
what people do to like not get caught is that i guess like
through uh is that like overlay the artwork that they want

364
00:35:55,020 --> 00:36:06,600
to trace with green so you can chroma key it out from the
fucking video so i was like i'm like geez that's so much

365
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:18,380
effort i know i was like what you can chrome you chroma key
out the green artwork that you overlaid so that it only

366
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,920
shows the liner

367
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:26,210
It is.

368
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:27,810
It's so much work.

369
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:31,330
I can't think of the tier one.

370
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:32,410
Get the tier one sub.

371
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:32,830
Thank you.

372
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:33,630
Thank you.

373
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:48,220
That's crazy.

374
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,000
That's why AI is fucking crazy now.

375
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,540
I cannot keep up.

376
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,720
I literally can't.

377
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,140
Oh my god.

378
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:16,900
Also recently, I've been, um, oh, oh, sorry, uh, I, like,
stopped a little bit, uh, recently, I've been, uh, looking

379
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:25,020
through that, you know, there's, like, a Twitter trend right
now where people look through, like, IMDb's season ratings

380
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:33,120
for each episode, and then people were, like, posting, like,
summaries of, like, children's shows, like, Dora the

381
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,400
Explorer, and...

382
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:44,400
Thomas the tank engine and stuff like that and then I love
there's like this guy who was like super obsessed with

383
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:49,160
Thomas the tank engine like that's like his like hyper
fixation

384
00:37:52,980 --> 00:38:03,460
it's like and then he was like then someone asked him um
here I was I'll post it here so someone asked him like oh i

385
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:15,920
wonder why like season 12 and 16 was so bad and he was
literally like every episode is is bad it's slop and like he

386
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:25,080
has like all the knowledge of thomas to take engine the
fucking show like it has by the way it has like what is how

387
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:37,100
many seasons oh my god a lot of seasons like 20 plus seasons
yeah of all like i mean he likes trains i would to be fair i

388
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:49,900
think i think it's because like i think it's because he just
has a very hyper fixation on trains in general um but yeah

389
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:55,380
no it's been going on for fucking decades and i like how
someone was like and then someone posted the game of thrones

390
00:38:55,380 --> 00:39:02,980
uh this is why i would never watch game of thrones like
someone posted a Game of Thrones summary thing where they're

391
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:12,280
like um where it was really sad because it was like 8 to 9 9
basically for their reviews slash ratings for Game of

392
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:30,740
Thrones and the very last episode was like 4.4 if you were
like it was literally like 8 8.5 8.7 9 9.9 9.3 of the season

393
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:41,800
of the series 4.4 and like so I'm like thinking like people
I'm like bro like why fuck would I commit to Game of Thrones

394
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:51,980
where where it where apparently the last episode is so
fucking bad that like it literally killed the franchise like

395
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:57,320
oh I didn't kill the franchise because we still have the
dragon show or whatever but like like the hype literally

396
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:09,500
died because It's like, it's so, apparently it's so bad That
like, that like, it just felt like you committed all that

397
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:18,220
time to watching the show Just to have, like, just to have
it like fall apart And like, apparently the reason why it

398
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:30,560
was so bad Was because the creators, the showrunners No, the
showrunners went to Star Wars right after showrunners like

399
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:38,180
Star Wars and yeah they wanted to write yeah they wanted to
write the fucking Star Wars sequel so they like fucked over

400
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:45,920
Game of Thrones they like rushed Game of Thrones to like go
to Star Wars and then their show got wait their show got

401
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:55,060
cancelled oh my bro and then their fucking show got
cancelled holy shit that's so sad dude bro they so they at

402
00:40:55,060 --> 00:41:01,400
least they did to be fair they don't need to ruin Star Wars
because they're already they're already doing it um jade

403
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:06,920
thank you for the hundred biddies thank you thank you sam
welcome to tomato farm welcome

404
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:19,200
i will i to be fair like they don't need to do much to ruin
star wars they already oh my god it was like i never watched

405
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:27,480
the last was it the last star wars movie all right here my
when i read this i only watched the first one the first star

406
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:35,900
the first uh sequel it was reboot for the Star Wars films
was it reboot okay what is it called like the the what is it

407
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:49,940
called the sequel sequel like is it the um the one with Kylo
Ren yeah so um I know like the first part of the film like

408
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:57,580
the first movie because it's a trilogy yeah the array
trilogy and then there's like a there's like a clip of of

409
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:07,760
like a movie theater trying to like watching the last movie
and then everyone was like no i hate star wars and then the

410
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:16,200
credit rules because apparently my life spoiler but it's a
good that i'm spoiling you guys by the way because it's

411
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:24,920
apparently a really bad film um um ray the main character
was like everyone was thinking she'll be like was it

412
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:32,520
palpatine's daughter or some or like great granddaughter or
something and people were super disappointed that she ended

413
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:43,740
up being a fucking Skywalker like another Skywalker and um
and like I think it's really weird that Finn the

414
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:48,700
stormtrooper wasn't a fucking Jedi like I thought

415
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:59,700
oh wait she's like oh like she's yeah but she's pal wait
she's palpatine's clone

416
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:06,060
Why the fuck is she like, I'm a Skywalker?

417
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,580
Why the fuck did she say that?

418
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:13,240
Like, I guess she's ashamed of her fucking name, I guess.

419
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:16,560
That's so weird.

420
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:25,040
I think it would have been better if she, like, kept
Palpatine's name and, like, try and, like, yeah, she just

421
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:25,620
called herself.

422
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:31,760
Yeah, okay, that's just weird that she fucking called
herself Skywalker, that she just renamed herself like that.

423
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:38,140
like i said i didn't watch it but i was just like reading
the summary and people were like mad that she called herself

424
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:46,520
a skywalker so i was really confused i was like she's a
skywalker but i felt like ben should have been ben should

425
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:56,300
have been like uh had like force powers like actual force
power it was just weird like like in the first movie he's

426
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:03,500
like i have the i'm holding the lightsaber um Like, you
know, and I'm like, oh, he's force sensitive.

427
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:07,280
And then they just, apparently they just didn't do anything
with that.

428
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:10,660
And I was like, and then people were like, yeah, he's not a
Jedi.

429
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:12,760
I'm like, how is he not a Jedi?

430
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:19,420
In the first movie, he literally held the fucking, the
fucking lightsaber.

431
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:27,060
Oh, he had low sensitivity to the force.

432
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,680
He literally teleported the fucking lightsaber.

433
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:34,020
How the fuck is he have low sensitivity?

434
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:43,930
It's not a key.

435
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:45,890
Like, so key.

436
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:47,910
Was it not?

437
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:48,970
No, he doesn't have to ask Kyle.

438
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:50,530
Did he, like, fucking him?

439
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:51,970
Anyway.

440
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:58,210
Anyway, I only watched the first film because, like, I heard
the second and third one didn't go so well.

441
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:00,650
Oh, yeah.

442
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:05,690
And I'm sad that, like, in the Mandalorian, like, they're
making...

443
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:10,550
They're making Pedro Pascal show his face more, but I'm
like, that's not...

444
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:12,730
That's not it.

445
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:22,930
Wait, was the trilogy made by three different directors?

446
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:25,110
That's stupid.

447
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:27,070
That's actually stupid.

448
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:30,490
Why the fuck has it been made by three separate directors?

449
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:38,050
Wait, two?

450
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:47,550
It's like, it's like Guardians of the, I like how I'm just
spreading misinformation about Star Wars.

451
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:49,250
People were like, that didn't happen with Finn.

452
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:50,030
I'm like, really?

453
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:50,810
Oh, whoops.

454
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:56,410
Just casually spreading misinformation.

455
00:45:57,810 --> 00:45:59,270
It happened in my head, okay?

456
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:03,250
It's not misinformation if I believe it in my heart.

457
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:19,750
believe it in my heart it's not misinformation in my head
it's canon exactly possible thank you for the five gift and

458
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:25,430
ships they can thank you jay thank you for the hundred
bitties thank you thank you okay i feel like it's just like

459
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:30,650
um i don't know yet anyone that follows like okay this is
what pissed me off about guardians of the galaxy because

460
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:38,050
guardians of the galaxy i love james gun when it comes to
his movies i think james gunn is a very good director and

461
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:44,530
really good at writing this before but he was the one that
he he was the one that wrote and direct i don't know if

462
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:51,870
direct as direct as well but he wrote the script for uh the
live action scooby-doo movies so i've always loved a lot of

463
00:46:51,870 --> 00:47:01,170
the stuff he's done um and um i know like some people don't
like james gunn's stuff because like we were like snyder i'm

464
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:07,530
not snyder versus james gunn my personally like james gunn's
dc more than snyder's dc and i don't know if people are

465
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:19,670
gonna fucking try to execute me over that but i've i've been
more interested in james gunn's vision for dc than hit than

466
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:35,090
snyder's vision uh for dc um and um and basically um i what
i really didn't like about guardians of the galaxy is that

467
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:48,950
james gunn had like a thought out plan for the trilogy for
Guardians of the Galaxy and and then like you know they had

468
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:58,350
to do the Avengers stuff you know so you know they they
basically like messed up James Gunn's plan so that so like

469
00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:06,330
he had to like fix it like they had to build off of the
Avengers movie um to like figure out what to do

470
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:11,430
All, like, messed up from that.

471
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:18,250
And I felt like that's why, like, three didn't feel as
strong as, like, the other movies.

472
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:21,690
Yeah, it had to align with the continuity.

473
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:35,890
Yeah, because all the Marvel movies are directed by
different directors.

474
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:40,430
Oh, look, there's Santa coming back.

475
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:47,190
Jake, thank you for the magenta soup.

Snyder cut oh wait they did I didn't say that guys Snyder

481
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:22,250
fans don't come at me guys I want to say I think I've only
watched I think I've watched like one Snyder film and I was

482
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:23,910
like that ain't that ain't it.

483
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:24,910
Oh, yeah, it was super.

484
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:34,270
I did not let I know that I know like the Snyder fans are
super passionate about like the Snyder The Snyder Superman

485
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:36,670
movie, but I didn't fuck with the Snyder.

486
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:46,790
Oh my god, his name is so fucking hard to say The Snyder um
Superman movie.

487
00:49:46,970 --> 00:49:56,050
I didn't I didn't like that one, but and then but I haven't
watched the James Gunn Superman movie, but James Gunn

488
00:49:56,050 --> 00:50:00,230
Superman movie gave us the rage-baiting chimpanzees.

489
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:02,570
So I think I know who won.

490
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:10,230
I think I know which movie is better.

491
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:24,620
But when I first saw that scene, I thought it was fucking
AI.

492
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:28,920
I was like, there's no, what the fuck is this?

493
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:31,120
Superman.

494
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:36,220
Superman is a bitch.

495
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:44,860
Movie ratings based on memes.

496
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:48,720
It's like Timothy Chalamey in his movie.

497
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:57,780
Okay, I don't know, you guys, yo, Timothy Chalamey is, but
he's the guy that played the, Wanka movie and he's also the

498
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:00,460
one that's dating Kim Kardashian's sister.

499
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:02,320
That was crazy.

500
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:07,820
The fact that like he's literally dating, like he's in the
Kardashian family right now.

501
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:12,640
Like, yeah, and he's the one in Dune.

502
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:14,600
I didn't watch Dune, by the way.

503
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:16,020
So he's also the guy in Dune.

504
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:22,800
So for those who actually know what Dune is, um, and he's
like been like going around doing like a marketing thing for

505
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:23,740
his newest movie.

506
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:25,140
Uh, yeah, they're still dating.

507
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:32,960
Uh, but yeah, he's like doing the this marketing thing for
his newest movie and he's like doing a lot of crazy shit so

508
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:40,680
he's like doing collabs with like big streamers um like i
don't remember what who that streamer is because like i

509
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:48,640
don't watch him but it's like basically like uh doing like
giant collabs with huge streamers to advertise his movie he

510
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:55,760
clearly climbed up the fucking uh the orb in las vegas you
know the giant orb in las vegas he climbed up on top of it

511
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:07,760
to advertise this movie and he also fucking released a rap
collab he released the fucking uh rap song and did a collab

512
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:14,260
with someone that people thought was him just to be just to
advertise this new movie and like okay what the fuck is this

513
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:19,380
new movie like because like you know it's working the
marketing is working because he's doing all these freaking

514
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:25,480
crazy shit where you're like what the fuck is this movie
like what the fuck is going on why is he doing all of this

515
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:34,300
um and then i looked at the movie and it's about ping pong
like it has nothing to do with whatever the fuck he's like

516
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:43,760
but whatever his marketing campaign is working it's about
like some documentary about this guy playing ping pong like

517
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:54,190
it's some like drama documentary shit I was like, what the
fuck?

518
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:56,590
The movie is called Mighty Mike.

519
00:52:56,990 --> 00:52:59,750
Yeah, it makes it look like it's like, I don't know.

520
00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:00,890
I don't fucking know.

521
00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:02,630
I don't even know what I expected.

522
00:53:02,970 --> 00:53:06,310
I just didn't expect it to be about ping pong.

523
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:06,890
Like,

524
00:53:12,570 --> 00:53:12,990
yeah.

525
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:18,340
Yeah, it worked.

526
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:20,880
It worked because I thought it was like, I don't know.

527
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,620
I just thought it was, it was just not ping pong.

528
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,920
That's all I thought about.

529
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,660
What's the rap song for?

530
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:32,380
Unrelated to the movie, apparently.

531
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:35,000
But he gave it a shout out.

532
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:41,390
The ultimate sport.

533
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:46,910
It worked though.

534
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:48,470
The marketing worked on me.

535
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:50,410
I was so fucking confused.

536
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:00,040
Dixie, welcome to Tomato Farm.

537
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:01,000
Welcome, welcome.

538
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:11,240
oh yeah and I read an interview from him and he was like oh
the reason why I'm doing all of this is that apparently he's

539
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:18,420
like a very forgettable like I guess so because like he's
like in a lot of movies but I can only remember him in two

540
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:27,360
movies and it's the and it's oh wait I can only remember him
in one movie and it's the Willy Wonka one and also the fact

541
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:33,960
that he's dating Kim Kardashian's sister um and that's like
literally the only thing I can like remember about Timothy

542
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:34,640
Shalemey.

543
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:38,620
But apparently, he does a lot of movies.

544
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:41,760
He wins like, oh, he wins like a lot.

545
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:43,680
He gets nominated for a bunch of stuff.

546
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:46,280
But he just has such a forgettable.

547
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:50,800
Like he's just like pretty forgettable in general, even
though he's really good at acting.

548
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:57,360
And so he's like, so that's why he's going like super hard
right now in marketing himself.

549
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:01,640
Because like people don't remember that he's on
Interstellar.

550
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:02,440
Interstellar?

551
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,920
I was like, he's an interseller?

552
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,700
Yeah, like, I was like, wait, he is?

553
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:15,720
Yeah, he's apparently, yeah, he's in that movie.

554
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:17,340
Yeah, wait, he was?

555
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:22,180
Yeah, people were like, he was like in the interview.

556
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:25,520
He's like, it pisses me off that people don't remember me
that.

557
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:27,380
Remember that I was in that movie.

558
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:32,340
And so that's why he's fucking going crazy right now in
marketing.

559
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:34,560
Because we're a fucking ping pong movie.

560
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:37,900
Like, yeah,

561
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:46,660
he can, he's so, he just has a sort of forgettable face.

562
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:51,340
No, he was like, the guy, the main character's son.

563
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:00,600
Don't insult.

564
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:03,400
Ping pong is intense to watch, though, I will say.

565
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:05,340
I don't remember.

566
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:08,580
Ping pong is very intense to watch.

567
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:12,740
I could never forget that face.

568
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:24,060
He's like a, he's like, just like, I guess like he's really
good at what he does.

569
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:27,980
It's just like he just doesn't, he's just not memorable for
me to remember him.

570
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:38,200
Yeah, he's a gamer, isn't he?

571
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:42,300
Doesn't he like, oh, doesn't he like game?

572
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:45,720
Oh yeah, speaking of, oh, and he, I know he loves basketball
and shit.

573
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,100
You see the NBA?

574
00:56:47,460 --> 00:57:00,860
There's a thing where like, uh, we're like, um, They did
like a basketball simulation Where like It was like Disney

They did a simulation.

582
00:57:45,650 --> 00:57:45,970
Let's see.

Mickey Mouse.

592
00:58:00,390 --> 00:58:00,990
Clubhouse.

593
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:08,870
What the fuck is this?

594
00:58:11,270 --> 00:58:13,710
Wait, why the fuck is Stitch here?

595
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:16,150
They couldn't get like...

596
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:17,530

What about Daisy?

599
00:58:24,830 --> 00:58:27,030
They replaced Daisy with Stitch?

600
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:28,170
Poor Daisy.

601
00:58:29,310 --> 00:58:30,530
Stitch is...

602
00:58:30,530 --> 00:58:31,970
Bro, Stitch doesn't even go.

603
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:33,250
go to the school.

604
00:58:33,870 --> 00:58:35,410
He doesn't go to the clubhouse.

605
00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:37,310
Where the fuck is Daisy?

606
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:41,630
Daisy actually has a role in the clubhouse.

607
00:58:43,310 --> 00:58:44,250
She's a girl.

608
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:46,870
Minnie's in the team.

609
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:50,190
I bet Daisy is taller than Minnie.

610
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:51,910
He does now.

611

Okay, okay.

I think I can get addicted to this.

1151
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:18,580
But we gotta stop.

1152
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:22,380
We gotta find a new Roblox game.

1153
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:24,040
This game.

1154
01:31:24,380 --> 01:31:25,720
This game is dangerous.

1155
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,200
It really is.

1156
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:30,620

1157
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:34,000

I forgot in this game you can actually be a guard.

1186
01:33:41,580 --> 01:33:43,460
I should have picked a guard.

1187
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:50,300
All right.

1188
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:54,800
Also, I lowered the sound a little bit.

1189
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:57,440
Yeah, you can be a guard in this game.

1190
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:09,680

1212
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:24,260

Yeah.

1214
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:33,780
There we go.

1215
01:35:40,780 --> 01:35:41,940
Wait, can I still be a guard?

1216
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:42,780
Okay, it's fine.

1217
01:35:43,020 --> 01:35:43,960
I don't need to be a guard.

1218
01:35:52,970 --> 01:35:53,350
Oh, shit.

1219
01:35:53,670 --> 01:35:54,150
Oh, shit.

1220
01:35:54,870 --> 01:35:55,970

1222
01:36:09,050 --> 01:36:12,190

Oh, I don't have my push anymore.

1235
01:37:08,930 --> 01:37:10,270
I wanted him to push them.

1236
01:37:10,790 --> 01:37:11,210

1237
01:37:11,730 --> 01:37:15,980

I'm such a helpful person, guys.

1240
01:37:24,890 --> 01:37:27,310
I pushed everyone to the finish line.

1241
01:37:27,510 --> 01:37:29,590
I saved everyone.

1242
01:37:29,850 --> 01:37:30,950
I'm a hero.

1243
01:37:32,970 --> 01:37:35,250

01:37:38,050 --> 01:37:39,530
I saved everyone.

1246
01:37:41,270 --> 01:37:43,050
I'm such a good person.

1247
01:37:51,980 --> 01:37:53,020
Okay, what's this?

01:40:01,190 --> 01:40:02,870
You picked the wrong door.

1284
01:40:03,370 --> 01:40:04,410
Wait, did he survive?

1285
01:40:06,070 --> 01:40:07,390

01:40:33,790 --> 01:40:35,630
There's still... Oh my god!

1296
01:40:36,330 --> 01:40:37,170

01:40:37,170 --> 01:40:39,430
Only six people died?

1298
01:40:40,450 --> 01:40:42,130
How are we all still here?

1299
01:40:42,570 --> 01:40:45,030
Only fucking six of us are dead.

This right here.

1306
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:28,060
This right here is where we die.

1307
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:31,620
Yeah, we can live, but we can't spell.

1308
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:33,460
This is one of my favorite game modes.

1309
01:41:33,680 --> 01:41:34,360
Where am I?

1310
01:41:36,980 --> 01:41:37,860

01:41:40,220 --> 01:41:40,720
No!

1312
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:42,340
They removed the song!

1313
01:41:49,380 --> 01:41:51,260
There's no song now!

1314
01:41:53,780 --> 01:41:56,600
Did they actually removed it because of copyright?

1315
01:41:58,120 --> 01:41:58,640
Okay.

1316
01:41:58,660 --> 01:41:59,720
That's crazy.

1317
01:42:00,460 --> 01:42:01,760
That's actually crazy.

1318
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:03,320
They removed the song.

1319
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:04,520
It's one of my favorites.

1320
01:42:07,740 --> 01:42:09,500
No, I think it got muted.

1321
01:42:09,580 --> 01:42:11,660
It got muted because of...

1322
01:42:13,240 --> 01:42:13,620
Two.

1323
01:42:14,260 --> 01:42:14,300
Two.

01:42:16,840 --> 01:42:17,240
You and me.

1327
01:42:18,120 --> 01:42:18,720
We did it.

1328
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:19,280
We did it.

1329
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:19,800
We live.

1330
01:42:20,260 --> 01:42:21,000
We live, Evan.

1331
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:21,900
You and me.

1332
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:24,520
Evan, you and me.

1333
01:42:26,700 --> 01:42:27,440
You and me.

1334
01:42:32,220 --> 01:42:33,540
That's a key right.

1335
01:42:33,940 --> 01:42:35,000
We got this, Evan.

1336
01:42:35,300 --> 01:42:36,160
You and me.

1337
01:42:39,800 --> 01:42:41,080
Let's go.

1338
01:42:41,500 --> 01:42:42,880
We fucking live.

1339
01:42:43,940 --> 01:42:44,860
Not us.

1340
01:42:45,220 --> 01:42:46,600
Not us, Evan.

1341
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:50,600
Let them go.

1342
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:54,020
All right.

1343
01:42:55,500 --> 01:42:57,000
We live another day.

1344
01:42:58,120 --> 01:42:59,040
You and me.

1345
01:42:59,240 --> 01:42:59,900
Pop, pop, pop.

1346
01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:03,560
I can't believe it.

1347
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:05,900
Wait, you guys not hearing the song either, right?

1348
01:43:07,980 --> 01:43:09,620
It's not just me, right?

1349
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:11,460
Oh my god.

1350
01:43:11,640 --> 01:43:11,940
Oh my god.

1351
01:43:12,060 --> 01:43:12,920
No, don't do this.

1352
01:43:13,380 --> 01:43:13,820

1353
01:43:16,860 --> 01:43:17,660
This is my.

1354
01:43:18,120 --> 01:43:18,600
Get out.

1355
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:21,500
Get out.

1356
01:43:21,580 --> 01:43:22,020

1359
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:26,260
Get out!

1360
01:43:28,350 --> 01:43:29,550
Oh my god, it's 10 seconds.

1361
01:43:29,930 --> 01:43:30,510
It's 10 seconds.

1362
01:43:30,670 --> 01:43:31,410
Get the fuck out.

1363
01:43:31,690 --> 01:43:32,810

1364
01:43:35,910 --> 01:43:36,350

1365
01:43:38,150 --> 01:43:43,570

1367
01:44:08,910 --> 01:44:12,850
my story will be rewritten as foretold

1368
01:44:15,970 --> 01:44:18,870
I shall be born again.

1369
01:44:19,410 --> 01:44:22,870
It took 11 players to set up.

1370
01:44:23,430 --> 01:44:24,070
Toki.

1371
01:44:28,570 --> 01:44:32,250
The power of having adult spending money.

1372
01:44:34,070 --> 01:44:34,730
Oh, you cheater?

1373
01:44:35,450 --> 01:44:37,550
You also bought it!

1374
01:44:37,850 --> 01:44:41,110
You're online because you also paid to revive!

1375
01:44:41,650 --> 01:44:43,510
This is the revive room!

1376
01:44:43,710 --> 01:44:45,270
You can't say shit!

1377
01:44:45,870 --> 01:44:49,730
You are part of the problem, didn't you?

1378
01:44:51,770 --> 01:44:56,290
You all bought revives to be in this room.

1379
01:45:00,230 --> 01:45:00,810
That's okay.

1380
01:45:01,350 --> 01:45:03,750
It means we don't have to go through that area.

1381
01:45:04,590 --> 01:45:05,990
You're so cool.

1382
01:45:10,310 --> 01:45:11,270
It's all right.

1383
01:45:11,650 --> 01:45:13,050
We don't have to do the mingle.

1384
01:45:13,390 --> 01:45:13,850
Look at that.

1385
01:45:13,930 --> 01:45:14,810
Guys, look at that.

1386
01:45:14,890 --> 01:45:15,790

jump rope i see more people voting for classic I mean, this
one's easy.

1390
01:45:50,950 --> 01:45:52,890
We have enough people to test it out.

1391
01:45:54,150 --> 01:45:55,910
We have enough people to...

1392
01:45:57,110 --> 01:45:58,790
To go through all the glass.

1393
01:46:01,770 --> 01:46:02,550
I believe.

1394
01:46:03,910 --> 01:46:04,570
At least that...

1395
01:46:04,570 --> 01:46:07,470
At least Mingle just, like, kicked half the players.

1396
01:46:09,530 --> 01:46:10,550
Thank God for that.

1397
01:46:21,030 --> 01:46:22,510
I think we can all vote to skip.

1398
01:46:23,550 --> 01:46:24,590
Guys, come on, guys.

1399
01:46:24,710 --> 01:46:25,170
We can all...

1400
01:46:25,170 --> 01:46:26,490
Guys, who is the one dragon?

1401
01:46:26,670 --> 01:46:30,030

01:47:45,400 --> 01:47:46,140
Oh, the guard can't.

1409
01:47:46,760 --> 01:47:48,240
He's like, oh, the guard lives.

1410
01:47:48,440 --> 01:47:50,020
That has to be the right one, right?

1411
01:47:51,260 --> 01:47:52,460
It's the one to the right.

1412
01:47:53,020 --> 01:47:53,720
It's that one.

1413
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:54,600
It's the right one.

1414
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:01,320
Come on.

1415
01:48:01,820 --> 01:48:02,660

Right.

01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:16,520
Next.

1422
01:48:20,140 --> 01:48:21,060

01:48:52,950 --> 01:48:54,810
We're all saying it's left.

1430
01:48:56,390 --> 01:48:58,050
He didn't believe in us.

1431
01:48:58,430 --> 01:48:59,230
No trust.

1432
01:48:59,690 --> 01:49:00,450

I can't show it on stream because it's very bad.

1505
01:56:28,780 --> 01:56:30,700
It's a very bad clip.

1506
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:33,260
But it's very funny.

1507
01:56:38,970 --> 01:56:41,290
Yeah, we're Sears!

1508
01:56:53,430 --> 01:56:55,330
Look at us, go!

1509
01:56:55,870 --> 01:56:57,230
Oh my god, my multi-chat died.

1510
01:56:57,670 --> 01:57:00,670
My- My fault, where did my multi-chat go?

1511
01:57:01,470 --> 01:57:01,890
Wait!

1512
01:57:03,530 --> 01:57:04,190
Yes!

1513
01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:10,780
Oh, I'm being carried!

1514
01:57:11,980 --> 01:57:13,140
Guys, give me a sec.

1515
01:57:13,780 --> 01:57:15,560
The multi-chat disappeared.

1516
01:57:17,820 --> 01:57:19,280
Where did my multi-chat go?

1517
01:57:19,380 --> 01:57:20,040
Oh, there it is.

1518
01:57:20,220 --> 01:57:21,440
There you go.

1519
01:57:21,640 --> 01:57:22,820
How do I slap my belly?

1520
01:57:23,400 --> 01:57:23,760
Yay!

1521
01:57:27,540 --> 01:57:28,820
Let's go!

1522
01:57:29,200 --> 01:57:30,720
My name is Eggbird!

1523
01:57:32,460 --> 01:57:33,360
I'm Eggbird!

1524
01:57:35,980 --> 01:57:37,060
Wait, can I transform?

1525
01:57:38,320 --> 01:57:39,860
I'm a choppy seal.

1526
01:57:40,580 --> 01:57:41,280
That's me.

1527
01:57:41,660 --> 01:57:42,760
Oh my god, wait!

1528
01:57:45,120 --> 01:57:46,140
Let's see.

1529
01:57:51,240 --> 01:57:52,420
Give me a a sec.

1530
01:57:52,940 --> 01:57:54,380
I gotta put on a hat.

1531
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:55,880
Give me a sec.

1532
01:57:56,060 --> 01:57:57,540
Let me put on my hat.

1533
01:57:58,640 --> 01:58:00,260
I need a bigger hat.

1534
01:58:02,520 --> 01:58:04,460
I have a mustache.

1535
01:58:06,780 --> 01:58:07,040
Ooh.

1536
01:58:08,240 --> 01:58:09,680
Guys, look at me.

1537
01:58:11,140 --> 01:58:11,680
Look at me.

1538
01:58:11,720 --> 01:58:12,580
How to clash.

1539
01:58:12,940 --> 01:58:13,420
Shut up.

1540
01:58:14,540 --> 01:58:16,040
In the evil time.

1541
01:58:17,540 --> 01:58:18,060
Yay!

1542
01:58:23,400 --> 01:58:26,380
Whoa, that's crap!

1543
01:58:26,540 --> 01:58:28,860
All right, get out.

1544
01:58:30,060 --> 01:58:30,540
Squish.

1545
01:58:30,840 --> 01:58:32,020
Oh my god.

1546
01:58:32,540 --> 01:58:32,780
Squish.

1547
01:58:33,360 --> 01:58:34,500
Squish, squish, squish, squish.

1548
01:58:35,140 --> 01:58:36,040
Squish, squish, squish.

1549
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:40,840
What?

1550
01:58:42,760 --> 01:58:44,260
I don't think...

1551
01:58:44,260 --> 01:58:46,560
I don't think seals make that sound.

1552
01:58:47,960 --> 01:58:49,800
I can scratch.

1553
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:51,740
The lead down.

1554
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:53,360
Wait, no!

1555
01:58:53,700 --> 01:58:54,640
Oh, I can dance!

1556
01:58:55,120 --> 01:58:55,180
Woo!

1557
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:59,080
Let's go!

1558
01:59:01,880 --> 01:59:02,840
I'm so happy!

1559
01:59:04,440 --> 01:59:05,590
Wait, wait, let's see.

1560
01:59:06,320 --> 01:59:08,580
I'm gonna be...

1561
01:59:08,580 --> 01:59:09,540
I'm gonna be...

1562
01:59:11,580 --> 01:59:12,280
Yeah!

1563
01:59:17,400 --> 01:59:18,100
Whoa!

1564
01:59:20,180 --> 01:59:23,820
No, no, no, I can't...

1565
01:59:23,820 --> 01:59:24,580
Yay!

1566
01:59:34,640 --> 01:59:36,540
There's seals, guys.

1567
01:59:47,520 --> 01:59:48,360
We're just...

1568
01:59:48,360 --> 01:59:49,780
Oh my god, wait, I can fish?

1569
01:59:52,860 --> 01:59:53,380
Wait.

1570
01:59:53,980 --> 01:59:54,840
How do I fish?

1571
01:59:56,960 --> 01:59:57,560
How...

1572
01:59:57,560 --> 01:59:58,680
I want to fish.

1573
02:00:00,340 --> 02:00:01,840
Let me fish.

1574
02:00:02,680 --> 02:00:03,040
Oh, wait.

1575
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:03,600
Here we go.

1576
02:00:05,680 --> 02:00:06,880
And then...

1577
02:00:06,880 --> 02:00:08,000
And then...

1578
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:08,640
How do I...

1579
02:00:08,640 --> 02:00:11,500
I guess I'm trying to fish, guys.

1580
02:00:11,820 --> 02:00:12,300
Stop.

1581
02:00:12,840 --> 02:00:13,500
I try...

1582
02:00:13,500 --> 02:00:14,100
I try...

1583
02:00:14,120 --> 02:00:18,280
I'm trying to figure out how to fish, guys.

1584
02:00:19,800 --> 02:00:20,000
Stop.

1585
02:00:23,800 --> 02:00:24,180
Oh, my God.

1586
02:00:24,420 --> 02:00:25,200
Now I'm swimming.

1587
02:00:33,940 --> 02:00:35,380
I can't.

1588
02:00:35,380 --> 02:00:35,880
I can't.

1589
02:00:36,140 --> 02:00:36,660
I can't.

1590
02:00:36,860 --> 02:00:38,040
Let me sit back.

1591
02:00:38,940 --> 02:00:39,400
No.

1592
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:42,820
Let's.

1593
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:47,560
Let's.

1594
02:00:48,080 --> 02:00:48,420
I can do it.

1595
02:00:48,500 --> 02:00:49,000
I can do it fish.

1596
02:00:49,120 --> 02:00:49,920
It's fishing time.

1597
02:00:52,800 --> 02:00:53,280
Okay.

1598
02:00:53,780 --> 02:00:55,100
I got my fishing ride.

1599
02:00:56,580 --> 02:00:58,460
And then, how do I...

1600
02:00:58,460 --> 02:00:59,060
Oh, fish.

1601
02:01:00,040 --> 02:01:00,880
Alright, I'm fishing.

1602
02:01:01,260 --> 02:01:01,720
Oh, shit!

1603
02:01:04,420 --> 02:01:05,240
What do I get?

1604
02:01:06,380 --> 02:01:06,680
Oh.

1605
02:01:08,540 --> 02:01:09,300
Let's go!

1606
02:01:09,740 --> 02:01:10,340
We can create more

1607
02:01:17,660 --> 02:01:18,540
time for me!

1608
02:01:21,760 --> 02:01:22,840
Let's do it.

1609
02:01:22,840 --> 02:01:23,620
Let's fish again.

1610
02:01:25,160 --> 02:01:25,880
again.

1611
02:01:26,920 --> 02:01:27,840
As I did.

1612
02:01:28,600 --> 02:01:30,600
I got a fish, guys.

1613
02:01:33,320 --> 02:01:34,560
Yes, please.

1614
02:01:35,120 --> 02:01:36,680
Please let me fish,

1615
02:01:40,970 --> 02:01:41,650
guys.

1616
02:01:42,330 --> 02:01:45,750
Get me out of here.

1617
02:01:46,170 --> 02:01:47,270
Get me out of here.

1618
02:01:48,310 --> 02:01:50,710
I got a sardine.

1619
02:01:51,550 --> 02:01:51,830
Hello.

1620
02:01:53,630 --> 02:01:54,950
I want to take you.

1621
02:01:55,170 --> 02:01:59,590
I want to Click the shake.

1622
02:02:01,410 --> 02:02:01,610
Whoa.

1623
02:02:07,790 --> 02:02:08,570
Oh, my God.

1624
02:02:08,790 --> 02:02:09,770
Wait, I got fish.

1625
02:02:09,930 --> 02:02:10,590
I got fish.

1626
02:02:12,570 --> 02:02:13,010
Okay.

1627
02:02:13,950 --> 02:02:14,730
We got fish.

1628
02:02:15,050 --> 02:02:15,550
Let's go.

1629
02:02:17,870 --> 02:02:18,210
Yay.

1630
02:02:20,740 --> 02:02:22,080
Wait, how big is the trout?

1631
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:25,020
Look at that, guys.

1632
02:02:25,140 --> 02:02:27,140
Guys, look at my fish, guys.

1633
02:02:28,200 --> 02:02:28,620
Show me.

1634
02:02:28,980 --> 02:02:29,840
Holy shit.

1635
02:02:29,940 --> 02:02:32,240
Look at the fucking everybody's just in the hole.

1636
02:02:33,440 --> 02:02:34,740
Just hit the fucking door.

1637
02:02:36,160 --> 02:02:38,160
Let's show our fishes, guys.

1638
02:02:38,460 --> 02:02:39,900
What fish did you guys get?

1639
02:02:40,640 --> 02:02:41,180
Look!

1640
02:02:41,940 --> 02:02:42,860
This is my fish.

1641
02:02:43,140 --> 02:02:43,500
Please clap.

1642
02:02:44,160 --> 02:02:44,720
Please clap.

1643
02:02:44,940 --> 02:02:46,280

Please clap for my fish, guys.

1645
02:02:48,480 --> 02:02:49,000

Yeah.

1647

Yeah, everyone.

1648
02:02:51,440 --> 02:02:51,740
Please clap.

1649
02:02:51,820 --> 02:02:52,020
Yeah!

1650
02:02:52,500 --> 02:02:54,300
The princess carried me.

1651
02:02:59,440 --> 02:03:02,140
Please clap for my fish, guys.

1652
02:03:02,540 --> 02:03:02,840
Please.

1653

Yay!

1654
02:03:12,840 --> 02:03:14,320
Okay, let's...

1655
02:03:14,320 --> 02:03:14,740

1656
02:03:15,300 --> 02:03:15,820
Yay!

1657
02:03:18,020 --> 02:03:19,140
Oh my god.

1658
02:03:20,320 --> 02:03:21,160
Wee!

1659
02:03:21,160 --> 02:03:21,620
Wee!

1660
02:03:22,220 --> 02:03:23,000
Wee!

1661
02:03:23,680 --> 02:03:24,520
Wee!

1662
02:03:24,720 --> 02:03:25,920
I love this game!

1663
02:03:26,540 --> 02:03:27,560
Oh my god!

1664
02:03:27,820 --> 02:03:28,180
Wee!

1665
02:03:28,520 --> 02:03:29,600
Oh, I can clap on this

1666
02:03:32,700 --> 02:03:33,180

Woohoo!

1668
02:03:36,540 --> 02:03:38,120
It was so fun, guys.

1669
02:03:38,640 --> 02:03:40,700
Oh my god, oh, okay, it's fine.

1670
02:03:41,660 --> 02:03:42,160
I'm okay.

1671
02:03:43,760 --> 02:03:45,040
Wait, I can swim away.

1672
02:03:45,320 --> 02:03:46,640
Oh my god, there's a fucking crab!

1673
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:49,060
Can't do anything to the crab, though.

1674
02:03:52,840 --> 02:03:53,780
Oh, I'm still clapping.

1675
02:03:54,020 --> 02:03:56,740
Give me, I need to, I need to stop clapping.

1676
02:03:57,660 --> 02:03:58,360
Okay, there we go.

1677
02:03:58,560 --> 02:04:00,620
I need to stop clapping.

1678
02:04:01,340 --> 02:04:07,120
Oh my god, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear the seals
clapping behind me.

1679
02:04:11,160 --> 02:04:12,900
Merry Christmas, everyone.

1680
02:04:18,200 --> 02:04:19,500
You're right behind me.

1681
02:04:19,540 --> 02:04:20,700
Oh, wait, how did you jump?

1682
02:04:21,860 --> 02:04:23,120
Wait, how did you do that?

1683
02:04:24,420 --> 02:04:24,800
Whoa!

1684
02:04:25,020 --> 02:04:25,780
Wait, I'm getting...

1685
02:04:25,780 --> 02:04:26,300
Oh, my God.

1686
02:04:26,560 --> 02:04:28,140
I'm getting some air right now.

1687
02:04:29,500 --> 02:04:29,800
Oh, wait.

1688
02:04:29,900 --> 02:04:30,360
There's an...

1689
02:04:31,180 --> 02:04:33,600
There's an abandoned building here.

1690
02:04:36,140 --> 02:04:36,980
Oh, my God.

1691
02:04:37,020 --> 02:04:38,080

1722
02:06:34,990 --> 02:06:36,570
A nocturnal fish...

Oh, my God.

1733
02:07:04,310 --> 02:07:05,710
One at a time, Seals.

02:07:08,150 --> 02:07:09,290
One at a time.

1735
02:07:09,510 --> 02:07:10,950
I'm very bad at surfacing.

1736
02:07:14,860 --> 02:07:15,480
Okay, I made it.

1737
02:07:15,520 --> 02:07:15,860

1744
02:07:28,880 --> 02:07:30,400
Oh my god, that's an orc.

1745
02:07:30,480 --> 02:07:31,920
That's a giant orca.

1746
02:07:32,540 --> 02:07:34,240
The killer of seals.

1747
02:07:36,280 --> 02:07:36,800
Run!

1748
02:07:39,200 --> 02:07:41,260

1759
02:08:56,860 --> 02:08:57,620

1762
02:09:07,800 --> 02:09:10,720
We were clapping so happily.

1763
02:09:11,580 --> 02:09:13,240
What happened to us?

1764
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,760
We're so happy with our claps.

1765
02:09:19,240 --> 02:09:19,800
I don't...

1766
02:09:20,720 --> 02:09:21,960
We should fish.

1767
02:09:23,400 --> 02:09:26,380
You're in this is a perfect fishing place, too, guys.

1768
02:09:28,680 --> 02:09:29,440
So true.

1769
02:09:30,980 --> 02:09:33,300
In the middle of all of this, let's fish.

1770
02:09:36,320 --> 02:09:37,660
Look at that.

1771
02:09:37,880 --> 02:09:39,420
Oh, I got sea bass.

1772
02:09:41,360 --> 02:09:42,380
Sea bass.

1773
02:09:43,200 --> 02:09:44,520
More like a bea bass.

1774
02:09:46,640 --> 02:09:47,500
Oh, hey, guys.

1775
02:09:47,540 --> 02:09:48,600
Another fishing zone.

1776
02:09:49,540 --> 02:09:50,720

That would be fucked up.

1783
02:10:35,320 --> 02:10:37,140
I wonder if there's actually anything here, though.

1784

He's trying to crash the pie.

1792
02:10:48,800 --> 02:10:50,940
And he's like, you did it and fight me.

1793
02:10:52,840 --> 02:10:53,200
Okay.

1794
02:10:53,700 --> 02:10:54,200

Where the fuck is there?

1889
02:15:47,030 --> 02:15:49,050
Maybe it's an immense bathroom.

1890
02:15:51,130 --> 02:15:51,770

02:16:01,830 --> 02:16:04,410
Where the fuck is the green guy?

1894

02:16:20,790 --> 02:16:21,330
She got unstuck.

1901
02:16:28,140 --> 02:16:29,100
Is that a bone?

1902
02:16:31,940 --> 02:16:32,840

1903
02:16:34,300 --> 02:16:34,840

Oh, wait.

1911
02:16:56,640 --> 02:16:57,500
That's just a reflection.

1912
02:16:57,860 --> 02:16:58,320
Never mind.

1913
02:16:59,060 --> 02:17:00,500

1915
02:17:04,200 --> 02:17:05,740

We'll never find the green card, guys.

1919
02:17:24,480 --> 02:17:27,180
We'll never be able to uncover the secret.

1920
02:17:28,040 --> 02:17:32,980
The secret of the secret of the seals.

1921
02:17:33,580 --> 02:17:36,140
We'll never be able to figure it out.

1922
02:17:40,740 --> 02:17:45,020
We'll never know what was going on here.

1923
02:17:49,900 --> 02:17:51,060

02:30:34,570 --> 02:30:35,170
That's it.

2055
02:30:35,670 --> 02:30:36,350
That's it.

2056
02:30:39,570 --> 02:30:40,410
That's it.

2057
02:30:40,570 --> 02:30:40,930
Oh, hey.

02:30:52,010 --> 02:30:52,230
You know?

2063
02:30:53,670 --> 02:30:54,930

What other controls do I have?

2071
02:31:08,230 --> 02:31:13,030
Let's see, I can grab, carry, custom movement.

2072
02:31:14,590 --> 02:31:15,850

2076
02:31:23,350 --> 02:31:24,590
It wasn't worth it.

2077

together.

02:33:27,800 --> 02:33:28,820
We're more tanky.

2114
02:33:29,180 --> 02:33:30,800
Dogs strong together.

2115
02:33:32,780 --> 02:33:34,000

Ground versus air.

2222
02:40:15,560 --> 02:40:19,060

2223
02:40:20,060 --> 02:40:20,940

02:40:32,910 --> 02:40:33,710
No, he's the good one.

2229
02:40:33,990 --> 02:40:35,850
He's the one that saved us.

2230
02:40:36,090 --> 02:40:37,730
He's part of the Mule crew.

2231
02:40:40,130 --> 02:40:40,790
Oh, never mind.

2232
02:40:40,930 --> 02:40:41,590

No, no one.

2242
02:40:56,050 --> 02:40:58,650
The Savannah is a cruel place, guys.

2243
02:40:59,250 --> 02:41:00,990
Wait, is that a black lion?

2244

Who would have thought the Savannah is a very dangerous
place.

Don't let him plant the flag.

2356
02:48:37,520 --> 02:48:39,500
It has to be for Canada.

2357
02:48:42,020 --> 02:48:43,400
Canadian is quick.

2358
02:48:44,560 --> 02:48:46,520
We gotta work together.

2359
02:48:46,700 --> 02:48:48,620
Clean Antarctica is our own.

2360
02:48:50,900 --> 02:48:52,920
We gotta do it for the queen.

2361
02:48:53,120 --> 02:48:55,000
May she rest in peace.

2362
02:48:56,360 --> 02:48:57,460
She's still our queen.

2363
02:48:57,940 --> 02:49:02,700
She's still on her fucking loonies and tunies and all of the
above.

2364
02:49:08,560 --> 02:49:09,380
Alright, here we go.

2365
02:49:11,200 --> 02:49:12,160
Oh, Canada.

2366
02:49:13,940 --> 02:49:14,780
Uh, ho, ho, ho.

2367
02:49:14,940 --> 02:49:15,880
What the fuck, Santa?

2368
02:49:18,940 --> 02:49:19,880
Oh, shit.

2369
02:49:20,100 --> 02:49:21,420
Santa, what the fuck?

2370
02:49:21,760 --> 02:49:23,680
Oh, my God, I got distracted by Santa.

2371
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:26,060
Wait, what's up with the...

2372
02:49:26,060 --> 02:49:26,280
Okay.

2373
02:49:26,600 --> 02:49:32,060
Oh my god.

2374
02:49:34,860 --> 02:49:44,920
Oh Canada, our home and native land, true patriot love.

2375
02:49:45,340 --> 02:49:48,200
And I forgot the lyrics.

2376
02:49:59,080 --> 02:50:00,200
Burn on.

2377
02:50:00,480 --> 02:50:01,800
Oh my god, someone quick.

2378
02:50:02,340 --> 02:50:02,740
Push him.

2379
02:50:03,060 --> 02:50:04,260
Someone push him.

2380
02:50:04,460 --> 02:50:06,740
Don't let him get up there.

2381
02:50:08,760 --> 02:50:11,540
When do we start eating each other?

2382
02:50:11,880 --> 02:50:13,580
The moment he dies, we eat him.

2383
02:50:13,980 --> 02:50:15,560
So no one can find his body.

2384
02:50:15,680 --> 02:50:16,440
Oh my god, wait, someone.

2385
02:50:16,520 --> 02:50:19,260
Oh, I thought that was like the RCMP just now.

2386
02:50:23,520 --> 02:50:25,760
How is she always ahead of me?

2387
02:50:26,460 --> 02:50:27,020
How?

2388
02:50:29,340 --> 02:50:30,580
Oh my god.

2389
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:31,760
Wait, what?

2390
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:37,420
Oh, I don't like that.

2391
02:50:39,040 --> 02:50:42,540
Oh my god, it's like it's almost gonna fucking drop or some
shit.

2392
02:50:44,120 --> 02:50:45,800
How is it still going?

2393
02:50:50,070 --> 02:50:50,790
It's okay.

2394
02:50:51,350 --> 02:50:51,990
It's okay.

2395
02:50:52,490 --> 02:50:53,990
We can still make it to the top.

2396
02:50:57,290 --> 02:50:59,330
Oh my god, how fucking long is this?

2397
02:50:59,530 --> 02:50:59,870
Oh, oh.

2398
02:51:00,890 --> 02:51:01,290

this guy almost dead.

2576
03:04:02,940 --> 03:04:03,560
He has zero HP.

2577
03:04:04,160 --> 03:04:05,680
Nearly someone can sneeze on him.

2578
03:04:07,240 --> 03:04:08,460
And then, like, he'd be dead.

2579
03:04:10,560 --> 03:04:11,460
Wait, is that the strat?

2580
03:04:11,600 --> 03:04:12,560

2581
03:04:14,340 --> 03:04:14,600
Oh.

2582
03:04:15,480 --> 03:04:17,840
A small and dangerous ice fall.

2583
03:04:18,580 --> 03:04:19,040
Oh.

2584
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:20,780
Oh, no.

2585
03:04:20,800 --> 03:04:22,760
It's getting a little scary now.

2586
03:04:25,930 --> 03:04:28,430
As long as none of us fall, we should be okay.

2587
03:04:32,490 --> 03:04:34,430
Guys, we should all be safe.

2588
03:04:37,680 --> 03:04:40,300
I think I just saw someone die.

2589
03:04:43,120 --> 03:04:47,180
I think I actually just saw someone jump the wrong way.

2590
03:04:50,420 --> 03:04:50,680
Okay.

2591
03:04:52,660 --> 03:04:53,220
Okay.

2592
03:04:53,500 --> 03:04:54,300
Making it.

2593
03:04:54,820 --> 03:04:56,880
Guys, we go to the hard one, guys.

2594
03:04:57,380 --> 03:04:58,260
Guys, come on.

2595
03:04:58,380 --> 03:04:59,200
To the right.

2596
03:05:00,200 --> 03:05:01,820
See, I'll lead the charge.

2597
03:05:04,760 --> 03:05:06,560
I'm gonna lead the way.

2598
03:05:06,760 --> 03:05:07,540
Guys, come on.

2599
03:05:07,820 --> 03:05:09,260
Come on, you guys, pussies.

2600
03:05:09,760 --> 03:05:11,700
Guys, don't be pussies now.

2601
03:05:13,740 --> 03:05:15,960
Don't do this again.

2602
03:05:19,940 --> 03:05:22,540
How come no one believes in me anymore?

2603
03:05:26,140 --> 03:05:27,500
Um, oh, shit.

2604
03:05:27,820 --> 03:05:27,980
Okay.

2605
03:05:28,840 --> 03:05:29,200
Okay.

2606
03:05:29,980 --> 03:05:31,120
See, we're okay.

2607
03:05:31,640 --> 03:05:35,580
Um, all I'm saying is, because, like, you guys didn't want
to do advanced with me.

2608
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:37,800
Um, so I had to...

2609
03:05:37,820 --> 03:05:40,280
to suck it up and do the baby one.

2610
03:05:42,440 --> 03:05:44,620
Like, no one else wanted to do advance.

2611
03:05:47,240 --> 03:05:48,780
I was gonna do it.

2612
03:05:50,380 --> 03:05:51,500
I'm like, fine.

2613
03:05:51,640 --> 03:05:55,280
I guess I'll do the baby route if you guys are all babies.

2614
03:05:57,860 --> 03:05:58,600
So what's the point?

2615
03:05:58,640 --> 03:06:00,360
What's the point in doing advance route?

2616
03:06:00,500 --> 03:06:03,280
If, like, no one can watch me do advance route in game.

2617
03:06:03,660 --> 03:06:04,620
Oh my god, here it is.

2618
03:06:04,660 --> 03:06:05,320

2931
03:32:16,140 --> 03:32:20,420
Mama's gonna get some water for the Christmas before we go
Christmas Kierling.

2932
03:32:20,640 --> 03:32:21,840
So you two play nice.

2933
03:32:21,980 --> 03:32:22,560
Okay, guys.

2934
03:32:22,620 --> 03:32:23,360
I'll be right back.

2935
03:35:58,400 --> 03:36:00,120
My food's here, too.

03:36:02,020 --> 03:36:04,020
And buy my foods, y'all.

2937

I want to grab my food, too.

2938

All right.

2939
03:36:11,420 --> 03:36:12,580

2940
03:36:12,740 --> 03:36:14,580
Did Timmy and Yimmy?

2941
03:36:15,120 --> 03:36:16,740
Did you both got along, guys?

2942
03:36:16,840 --> 03:36:19,160
Okay, let me eat my food first before we go Carolyn, guys.

2943
03:36:19,260 --> 03:36:20,060
Mama got to eat.

2944
03:36:21,460 --> 03:36:21,900
Hungy.

2946
03:36:25,900 --> 03:36:27,180

2951
03:36:58,280 --> 03:37:03,480

2952
03:37:03,780 --> 03:37:04,840
Timmy, is that true?

2953
03:37:04,960 --> 03:37:06,240
Did you kick Yimmy?

2954
03:37:07,020 --> 03:37:07,340
Oh, sorry.

Yeah, Timmy, sorry.

2956
03:37:08,960 --> 03:37:10,180
Timmy, is that true?

2957
03:37:10,380 --> 03:37:11,960
Did you kick Yimmy?

2958
03:37:17,980 --> 03:37:19,880
Surely no money will look over.

2959
03:37:20,300 --> 03:37:21,680
Thank you, Mr. Chat.

2960
03:37:21,680 --> 03:37:21,980
Leon.

2961
03:37:22,340 --> 03:37:22,560
Thank you.

2962
03:37:22,600 --> 03:37:23,660
Thank you.

2963
03:37:23,660 --> 03:37:23,920
Thank you.

2964
03:37:23,920 --> 03:37:25,780
I'm truly thinking of a five-gifted toast.

2965
03:37:26,040 --> 03:37:26,760
Thank you.

2966
03:37:31,570 --> 03:37:32,950
Yimmy did it first.

2967
03:37:33,050 --> 03:37:33,870
Is that true?

2968
03:37:34,150 --> 03:37:36,270
Yimmy, did you kick Timmy first?

2969
03:37:41,890 --> 03:37:43,390
Next day, thank you for the super chat.

2970
03:37:43,570 --> 03:37:43,670
Thank you.

2971
03:37:43,990 --> 03:37:44,270
Thank you.

2972
03:37:45,230 --> 03:37:47,930
It's a Jewish tradition to get Chan his food on Christmas.

2973
03:37:48,130 --> 03:37:49,870
Is there a dish you particularly recommend?

2974
03:37:50,290 --> 03:37:52,930
Which is like mouth-watering chicken.

2975
03:37:53,610 --> 03:37:54,170
It's so good.

2976
03:37:54,290 --> 03:37:56,950
It's like cold chicken drenched in chili oil.

2977
03:37:57,150 --> 03:37:58,230
And it's so fucking good.

2978
03:37:58,830 --> 03:38:01,130
And total C, which is shredded potatoes.

2979
03:38:02,050 --> 03:38:05,930
It's like sour vinegar shredded to potatoes.

2980
03:38:06,090 --> 03:38:07,610
And it's so fucking good too.

2981
03:38:15,280 --> 03:38:15,620
favorites.

2982
03:38:15,720 --> 03:38:19,020
I'm treating Timmy and Yemi both equally.

2983
03:38:22,420 --> 03:38:23,820
I don't have favorites.

2984
03:38:27,260 --> 03:38:29,240
You're both equal in my eyes.

2985
03:38:46,280 --> 03:38:48,600
I'm just slightly better.

2986
03:38:55,940 --> 03:38:59,380
You guys gotta fight for mommy's affections, guys.

2987
03:39:01,540 --> 03:39:03,380
Then maybe I'll have a favorite.

2988
03:39:03,980 --> 03:39:06,180
Bird, thank you Super chat, thank you, thank you.

2989
03:39:06,800 --> 03:39:08,400
Remember, we're your favorite.

2990
03:39:09,120 --> 03:39:11,400
Mehdi, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

2991
03:39:11,840 --> 03:39:15,220
Now how come Timmy got a PS5 for Christmas?

2992
03:39:15,640 --> 03:39:16,820
You got...

2993
03:39:16,820 --> 03:39:18,400
You got an Xbox.

2994
03:39:19,220 --> 03:39:20,580
Is that not good enough?

2995
03:39:22,580 --> 03:39:24,460
It's the console wars.

2996
03:39:25,780 --> 03:39:28,420
Mr. Broken Bond, thank you for the super chat, thank you,
thank you.

2997
03:39:28,460 --> 03:39:30,880
Timmy is using his status as the oldest of Boilies.

2998
03:39:31,100 --> 03:39:33,580
Please punish Timmy to the timeout chair.

2999
03:39:42,770 --> 03:39:50,890
Look, one got an Xbox, the other got a PlayStation, and then
mom, mommy, got a PC with a 50-90.

3000
03:39:58,570 --> 03:40:00,210
Mama got the PC.

3001
03:40:03,470 --> 03:40:06,870

3002

Yimmy is fine.

3015
03:42:03,230 --> 03:42:05,130
Timmy's the one with more regulations.

3016
03:42:10,380 --> 03:42:11,680
Timmy, your father?

3017
03:42:13,000 --> 03:42:14,680
Your father is very strict.

3018
03:42:16,940 --> 03:42:18,660
I break one rule in the custody.

3019
03:42:19,820 --> 03:42:21,000
And that's custody agreement.

3020
03:42:21,160 --> 03:42:22,260
And it's over, Timmy.

3021
03:42:24,640 --> 03:42:33,680

03:43:04,840 --> 03:43:05,700
I gotta get my child's...

3026
03:43:05,700 --> 03:43:07,540
I gotta get my child's support.

3027
03:43:08,680 --> 03:43:09,900
Whenever I get paid.

3028
03:43:10,980 --> 03:43:11,980
You know, Timmy?

3029
03:43:12,680 --> 03:43:20,080
Whenever mommy gets a paycheck from your daddy, that's the
child's support for taking care of you.

3030
03:43:24,200 --> 03:43:26,640
My paycheck from Amazon.

3031
03:43:43,850 --> 03:43:46,570
And Yimmy, we don't know who your real father is.

3032
03:43:46,830 --> 03:43:47,390
I'm sorry.

3033
03:44:11,530 --> 03:44:14,970
That's why you get to stay with me longer.

3034
03:44:22,300 --> 03:44:22,660
All right.

3035
03:44:27,240 --> 03:44:28,880
I am done now.

3036
03:44:29,540 --> 03:44:30,180
I'm done eating.

3037
03:44:31,000 --> 03:44:37,480
I do have more food that I ordered, but I don't want to get
too bloated for caroling.

3038
03:44:38,200 --> 03:44:38,500
All right.

3039
03:44:46,100 --> 03:44:46,620
All right.

3040
03:44:47,520 --> 03:44:50,900
We're gonna do Christmas caroling now, Timmy and Yimmy.

3041
03:44:54,600 --> 03:44:57,100
So, um, ladies, thank you for the super chat.

3042
03:44:57,160 --> 03:44:58,080
Thank you, thank you.

3043
03:44:59,320 --> 03:44:59,940
Hi, Joki.

3044
03:45:00,180 --> 03:45:01,320
Here, it's already the 26th.

3045
03:45:01,380 --> 03:45:02,640
Can I get a happy birthday, please?

3046
03:45:02,820 --> 03:45:04,880
Also, the other day, while catching VODs.

3047
03:45:05,920 --> 03:45:07,620
I heard about you wanting new videos, and I appreciate that.

3048
03:45:07,720 --> 03:45:08,360
It's hard to catch streams.

3049
03:45:08,460 --> 03:45:09,560
Yeah, we're at 2026.

3050
03:45:11,100 --> 03:45:13,360
I'm gonna be doing, I'm gonna be posting videos.

3051
03:45:13,740 --> 03:45:17,440
I'm still trying, in the process of trying to find the
perfect editor for us.

3052
03:45:17,460 --> 03:45:22,560
because I do want, like, you know, very, I'm very stickler
when it comes to, like, videos and stuff, because videos

3053
03:45:22,560 --> 03:45:28,880
have to be, like, in a way where the people who, to make
sure that people don't click away.

3054
03:45:30,140 --> 03:45:35,540
So I have to figure out, like, what kind, I have to figure,
like, you know, gotta look through a bunch of editors and

3055
03:45:35,540 --> 03:45:37,940
stuff to find the perfect one for us, the perfect match.

3056
03:45:39,120 --> 03:45:41,100
But yeah, anyway, thank you for the super chat.

3057
03:45:41,180 --> 03:45:41,960
Thank you, thank you.

3058
03:45:42,180 --> 03:45:43,680
Happy birthday to you.

3059
03:45:44,080 --> 03:45:45,400
Happy birthday to you.

3060
03:45:47,460 --> 03:45:49,020
Happy birthday to you.

3061
03:45:49,280 --> 03:45:49,800
All right, guys.

3062
03:45:50,300 --> 03:45:54,940
So, Timmy, Yimmy, we're going to go grab the others, all
right?

3063
03:45:57,800 --> 03:46:00,160
So, we're going to go out and grab the other.

3064
03:46:00,260 --> 03:46:01,860
I'm going to go out and grab the others.

3065
03:46:01,980 --> 03:46:03,880
So, I'll be right back to me and Yimmy.

3066
03:46:05,880 --> 03:46:12,500
I've realized, if it feels confusing, I realized I sort of
made a mistake in this and the way I set this up.

3067
03:46:12,580 --> 03:46:15,200
So, I don't know how to segue to this bit that I have.

3068
03:46:17,560 --> 03:46:23,800
So to all the Timmy's and Yimmy's that aren't here with me
today, we're gonna go grab them real quick.

3069
03:46:24,100 --> 03:46:24,600
Okay, guys?

3070
03:46:25,000 --> 03:46:27,200
All right, give me a sec.

3071
03:46:28,120 --> 03:46:28,620
Give me a sec.

3072
03:46:28,760 --> 03:46:30,980
I'll be back very soon, Timmy and Yimmy's.

3073
03:46:31,100 --> 03:46:37,360
We're just gonna grab the other Timmy's and Yimmy's to make
sure we have enough backup seniors for the Christmas

3074
03:46:37,360 --> 03:46:38,380
caroling, guys.

3075
03:46:39,540 --> 03:46:45,220
Like I said, I realize I forgot how to, I don't know how, I
realize I have like an oversight in terms of how to set this

3076
03:46:45,220 --> 03:46:47,280
up, but like this is a good bit, I swear to God.

3077
03:46:47,460 --> 03:46:47,760
Hi.

3078
03:47:10,420 --> 03:47:10,840
Hey.

3079
03:47:11,240 --> 03:47:12,580
Open up.

3080
03:47:14,360 --> 03:47:15,160
Gibby.

3081
03:47:15,500 --> 03:47:16,160
Gibby.

3082
03:47:16,880 --> 03:47:18,900
Sorry to go Christmas caroling.

3083
03:47:37,810 --> 03:47:38,510
Hey.

3084
03:47:43,460 --> 03:47:44,260
Hey.

3085
03:47:45,420 --> 03:47:46,240
I clicked the wrong thing.

3086
03:47:46,760 --> 03:47:46,780
Hey.

3087
03:47:47,960 --> 03:47:51,300
What are you doing?

3088
03:47:51,820 --> 03:47:53,340
It's Christmas caroling time.

3089
03:47:53,660 --> 03:47:54,420
It's 6.30.

3090
03:47:54,520 --> 03:47:55,280

I'm

3143
03:53:30,690 --> 03:53:33,670
so like crazy for not realizing that.

3144
03:53:34,310 --> 03:53:36,510
Why would we give way to water packs?

3145
03:53:36,710 --> 03:53:38,090
So we could use it as a blanket?

3146
03:53:39,490 --> 03:53:40,310
Here we go.

3147
03:53:41,530 --> 03:53:43,150
That's the reaction I thought I'd get.

3148
03:53:43,470 --> 03:53:44,810
I don't know what the instrument is.

3149
03:53:44,810 --> 03:53:49,450
This room has been associated with ideated with basketball
at the mall of various old jobs.

3150
03:53:49,610 --> 03:53:52,930
He runs around town for free or at most odd dollar.

3151
03:53:54,770 --> 03:53:55,630
Fire up!

3152
03:53:58,330 --> 03:54:07,430
So rudely it's made fun of his feet Or boys, a sister, a
shortness When he wasn't looking But the next time you see

3153
03:54:07,430 --> 03:54:11,630
him He'd still go out of his way to smile And where about
you when I ask you About your mother's separation Or

3154
03:54:11,630 --> 03:54:20,170
something like that Because he unlike us Actually cares
about someone other than himself The reason I bring this up

3155
03:54:20,170 --> 03:54:26,290
to you Is because I was the worst offender

3156
03:54:33,510 --> 03:54:39,770
Going nowhere, then the tiny little man rushed to my side.

3157
03:54:40,810 --> 03:54:44,010
He should have gotten a big thank you.

3158
03:54:45,030 --> 03:54:48,050
Instead he got poured a potty ride.

3159
03:54:53,410 --> 03:54:56,150
I'm here for the chorus, guys.

3160
03:54:57,010 --> 03:54:58,150
Why am I seeing this part?

3161
03:54:58,210 --> 03:54:59,490
This part's not important.

3162
03:55:01,850 --> 03:55:03,750
Whoa, freaky?

3163
03:55:05,270 --> 03:55:07,530
Never watch some football.

3164
03:55:08,510 --> 03:55:11,110
A fuzzy screen was all that we could see.

3165
03:55:12,510 --> 03:55:15,550
Whitey came over with a hanger.

3166
03:55:16,730 --> 03:55:19,290
Spent the game atop a TV.

3167
03:55:26,500 --> 03:55:27,220
Wow!

3168
03:55:27,920 --> 03:55:29,020
Oh my god, please, hurry.

3169
03:55:29,120 --> 03:55:30,840
I'm here for the chorus.

3170
03:55:31,080 --> 03:55:31,560
Come on.

3171
03:55:31,680 --> 03:55:33,140
Get to the good part.

3172
03:55:34,140 --> 03:55:34,560
Sorry.

3173
03:55:35,000 --> 03:55:37,800
Sorry, don't worry, Christmas Carol will go a lot better
when we're outside.

3174
03:55:40,360 --> 03:55:41,880
Whoa, I don't remember this line.

3175
03:55:49,820 --> 03:55:50,300
Whoa.

3176
03:55:56,160 --> 03:55:58,140
Where is the part?

3177
03:56:02,240 --> 03:56:05,480
I gotta get some wine.

3178
03:56:13,400 --> 03:56:16,680
Who said starting with the worst?

3179
03:56:17,040 --> 03:56:18,260
This is a classic.

3180
03:56:19,000 --> 03:56:21,500
I just, I don't care about this part of the song.

3181
03:56:22,140 --> 03:56:23,660
I just need the chorus.

3182
03:56:26,720 --> 03:56:33,660
Oh, and the last night of heart goes just not fair.

3183
03:56:34,800 --> 03:56:37,580
Bum bitty bitty bitty bum bum.

3184
03:56:38,720 --> 03:56:41,240
Bum bitty bitty bitty bum.

3185
03:56:41,960 --> 03:56:46,780
Bum bitty bitty bitty bum bum.

3186
03:56:47,720 --> 03:56:49,900
Bum bitty bitty bitty bum.

3187
03:56:51,720 --> 03:56:58,620
Wonder if that guy ever wiped his ass with the wrong hand.

3188
03:56:59,180 --> 03:57:02,700
Bum bitty bitty bitty bitty bum bum.

3189
03:57:03,660 --> 03:57:06,040

Kierling?

3193
03:57:31,620 --> 03:57:34,320
We got a lot more of these too

3194
03:57:37,540 --> 03:57:44,300
I put that as the first song on my list But then I'd never
listen to the first part of the song.

3195
03:57:44,560 --> 03:57:48,840
I've always just listened to like, um, to the ending part.

3196
03:57:48,940 --> 03:57:51,160
And I was like, oh, I do not remember this part.

3251
04:03:08,880 --> 04:03:09,940
What song is that?

3252
04:03:13,940 --> 04:03:14,580
Oh,

3254
04:03:32,540 --> 04:03:33,940
Is it this one?

3255
04:03:39,830 --> 04:03:41,310
I don't even know the audio.

3256
04:03:43,230 --> 04:03:45,730
I sang this a lot when I was in private school.

3257
04:03:47,750 --> 04:03:52,270
King, the sisters walked the crowd on the feast of semen.

3258
04:03:53,090 --> 04:03:58,390
When the snow lay round about deep and crisp and even.

3259
04:03:59,270 --> 04:04:04,010
Brightly shone the moon that night through the frost was
cruel.

3260
04:04:06,370 --> 04:04:21,290
came in sight gathering winter fuel oh my gosh thither page
and stand by me if thou knows it's telling yonder pleasant

3261
04:04:21,290 --> 04:04:34,130
who is he where in what his dwelling saw he lives a good
leak hence underneath the mountain right against the forest

3262
04:04:34,130 --> 04:04:37,330
fence by st agnes fountain.

3263
04:04:38,290 --> 04:04:39,870
Oh, I fucked that up.

3264
04:04:41,170 --> 04:04:43,730
It's been a while since I was in a church.

3265
04:04:44,950 --> 04:04:49,050
Time walks hither through thou and shall see him.

3266
04:04:49,170 --> 04:04:52,310
It's not because, like, you know, I'm not allowed in a
church.

3267
04:04:52,470 --> 04:04:54,190
I just haven't been in a church in a while.

3268
04:04:55,390 --> 04:04:57,570
And by a while, I meant, like, decades.

3269
04:04:59,070 --> 04:05:04,370
Through the rude winds, wild lemon, and the bitter weather.

3270
04:05:06,070 --> 04:05:15,070
I remember there was a song that's not it's like the same
tune and but it's not this lyrics so stronger files my heart

which the saint had printed therefore christian men be sure

You know, Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen, Common
and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen.

3329
04:10:18,860 --> 04:10:26,400
But do you recall the most famous reindeer of all?

3330
04:10:27,480 --> 04:10:33,300
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and a very shiny nose.

3331
04:10:34,180 --> 04:10:39,680
And if you ever saw it, you would even say it closed.

3332
04:10:39,700 --> 04:10:54,640
All of the other reindeers Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph Join in any reindeer games Then

3333
04:10:54,640 --> 04:11:01,080
one foggy Christmas Eve Santa came to say Yimmy, why aren't
you singing?

3334
04:11:01,300 --> 04:11:07,300
Rudolph with your nose so bright Won't you guide my sleigh
tonight?

3335
04:11:07,900 --> 04:11:20,180
Then how the reindeers love Tim as they shout it out with
glee Rudolph the red nose reindeer You'll go down in history

3336
04:11:21,020 --> 04:11:32,520
Yay Tim you're doing great doing great with those matches

3337
04:11:32,520 --> 04:11:35,920

3338
04:11:39,040 --> 04:11:41,700
That's right, good job, Yumi.

3339
04:11:42,300 --> 04:11:43,480
Good job.

3340
04:11:45,480 --> 04:11:48,360
Our schedule said Christmas caroling.

3341
04:11:48,560 --> 04:11:50,820
Where is my Christmas caroling?

3342
04:11:52,000 --> 04:11:53,920

Bada-bada-bada-bada-bada-bada-bada-bada-bada-bada-bada-bada-bada.

3345
04:12:14,540 --> 04:12:21,120
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer had a very shiny nose.

3346
04:12:22,220 --> 04:12:28,000
And if you ever saw it, you would even say it glows.

3347
04:12:28,980 --> 04:12:34,980
All of the other reindeers used to laugh and call him names.

3348
04:12:35,920 --> 04:12:41,960
They never let poor Rudolph join in any rude air games.

3349
04:12:43,140 --> 04:12:52,540
Then one foggy Christmas Eve, Santa came to say, Rudolph
with your nose so bright.

3350
04:12:52,660 --> 04:12:53,580
Yimmy, you're flat.

3351
04:12:54,160 --> 04:12:56,000
You got my sleigh tonight.

3352
04:12:56,760 --> 04:13:02,180
Then how the reindeer loved him as they shouted out with
glee.

3353
04:13:03,600 --> 04:13:05,660
Rudolph the red nose drained.

3354

The thing and then, and then Timmy, you're going to give the

04:32:22,200 --> 04:32:24,520
You want to build a snowman?

3580
04:32:25,100 --> 04:32:27,240
We're riding bikes around the homes.

3581
04:32:28,080 --> 04:32:29,960
I think some company is overdue.

3582
04:32:30,300 --> 04:32:33,240
I've started talking to the pictures on the walls.

3583
04:32:33,480 --> 04:32:34,080
Hang in there, Joan.

3584
04:32:34,440 --> 04:32:35,980
It gets a little lonely.

3585
04:32:36,540 --> 04:32:37,960
All these empty rooms.

3586
04:32:38,240 --> 04:32:41,240
Just watching the hours take by.

3587
04:32:45,270 --> 04:32:47,470
And then her parents die.

3588
04:32:48,050 --> 04:32:48,690
Rest in peace.

3589
04:32:51,810 --> 04:32:52,290
Goodbye.

3590
04:32:54,150 --> 04:32:57,470
Like every Disney movie, the parents never live.

3591
04:32:58,450 --> 04:32:59,730
I built a character.

3592
04:33:03,840 --> 04:33:06,360
But this isn't a Disney movie to me and Jimmy.

3593
04:33:06,900 --> 04:33:08,920
I'll be alive forever.

3594
04:33:10,320 --> 04:33:12,940
You got to get rid of me.

3595
04:33:19,340 --> 04:33:22,220
07 to Anna and Elsa's parents.

3596
04:33:40,830 --> 04:33:42,350
That's right.

3597
04:33:50,970 --> 04:33:52,430
Elsa, please.

3598
04:33:53,150 --> 04:33:55,130
I know you're in there.

3599
04:33:56,570 --> 04:33:58,730
People are asking where you've been.

3600
04:34:00,190 --> 04:34:02,930
They say have courage, and I'm trying to.

3601
04:34:03,370 --> 04:34:05,150
I'm right out here for you.

3602
04:34:05,630 --> 04:34:07,410
Just let me in.

3603
04:34:09,170 --> 04:34:10,770
We only have each other.

3604
04:34:11,390 --> 04:34:12,930
Just you and me.

3605
04:34:13,590 --> 04:34:16,050
What are we gonna do?

3606
04:34:16,230 --> 04:34:16,610
You

3607
04:34:19,990 --> 04:34:24,610
want to build a snowman?

3608
04:34:37,630 --> 04:34:38,390
Whoa!

3609
04:34:40,130 --> 04:34:40,610
Yeah!

3610
04:34:43,710 --> 04:34:56,110
Frosty, the snowman, was a jolly happy soul With a corn cob
pipe and a button nose And his eyes ring out of coal Frosty,

3611
04:34:56,410 --> 04:35:05,810
the snowman, made the children And were they surprised when
before their eyes he came to life that day?

3612
04:35:06,650 --> 04:35:11,670
There must have been some magic in that old silk hat they
found.

3613
04:35:12,550 --> 04:35:17,630
For when they placed it on his head, he began to dance
around.

3614
04:35:18,170 --> 04:35:23,390
Whoa, Frosty, the snowman was alive as he could be.

3615
04:35:24,250 --> 04:35:29,850
And the children say he could laugh and play just the same
as you and me.

3616
04:35:31,090 --> 04:35:35,390
Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day.

3617
04:35:36,010 --> 04:35:41,530
So he said let's run in we'll have some fun before I melt
away.

3618
04:35:42,430 --> 04:35:52,890
Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand, running
here and there all around the square saying catch me if you

3619
04:35:52,890 --> 04:35:53,430
can.

3620
04:35:54,090 --> 04:35:59,510
He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic
cop.

3621
04:36:00,090 --> 04:36:05,130
And only pause a moment when they heard him holler, stop.

3622
04:36:06,690 --> 04:36:11,270
Frosty, the snowman, had to hurry on his way.

3623
04:36:11,870 --> 04:36:17,030
But he waited by saying, don't you cry, I'll be back again
someday.

3624
04:36:18,070 --> 04:36:22,830
Thumpity, thump, thump, thumpity, thump, thump, look at
Frosty, go.

3625
04:36:23,890 --> 04:36:25,270
Thumpity, thump, thump,

3626
04:36:29,230 --> 04:36:31,110
Look at that, guys.

3627
04:36:31,390 --> 04:36:35,190
Look, Elsa built the snowman with Anna.

3628
04:36:38,490 --> 04:36:40,270
That was not flat at all.

3629
04:36:40,550 --> 04:36:41,390
It worked out perfectly.

3630
04:36:41,470 --> 04:36:44,370
I don't know how the fuck Frosty instacute after.

3631
04:36:46,090 --> 04:36:48,110
Look at that, guys.

3632
04:36:50,150 --> 04:36:51,950
Stop, stop resisting.

3633
04:36:53,910 --> 04:36:56,250
Frosty, get the snowman.

3634
04:36:58,010 --> 04:36:59,650
It worked out perfectly.

3635
04:37:00,150 --> 04:37:04,790
it's a happy ending everyone they built the snowman together

3636
04:37:09,230 --> 04:37:13,380
look at that look at that guys they did it

3637
04:37:16,830 --> 04:37:25,990
of all the things they could play i know i was like oh
that's good timing all right let's see there's another song

3638
04:37:25,990 --> 04:37:33,470
i want to sing wait actually maybe i wrote it down Sometimes
I write down fun songs to sing, but sometimes I don't.

3639
04:37:35,190 --> 04:37:38,370
Did I, it's like, did I do it or no?

3640
04:37:38,730 --> 04:37:41,410
Well, okay, I really want to sing this song, but I'm so bad
at this song.

3641
04:37:41,510 --> 04:37:43,410
Also, I don't know if I get away with it.

3642
04:37:44,590 --> 04:37:49,590
As in like, I don't know if like Twitch would let me.

3643
04:37:58,440 --> 04:38:01,120
That's the hardest part with multi-streaming, with karaoke.

3644
04:38:01,740 --> 04:38:03,060
Because like, I don't know.

3645
04:38:06,220 --> 04:38:08,440

Here in Duckburg, race cars, lasers, aeroplanes, it's a duck
blur.

3650
04:38:50,760 --> 04:38:55,460
Might solve a mystery or rewrite history.

3651
04:38:56,000 --> 04:38:57,400
Duck tales, ooh.

3652
04:38:58,460 --> 04:39:02,880

3656

When it seems they're heading for Final Curtain Call

messes Meek-on-sasses Dock-tails, ooh Every day they're out

There's a stranger out to find you.

3661
04:39:51,200 --> 04:39:54,340
What to do, just grab on to some duck tails.

3662
04:39:56,000 --> 04:39:58,640
Oh, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

3663
04:39:59,020 --> 04:40:00,100
Meow, meow, meow.

3664
04:40:00,360 --> 04:40:04,760
I will have to say, I did grow up with the newest for the
DuckTales reboot, not the old one.

3665
04:40:05,200 --> 04:40:05,800
Ooh.

3666
04:40:10,220 --> 04:40:11,400
DuckTales, ooh.

04:40:18,180 --> 04:40:21,900
Tales of Deering, do bad and good luck tales.

3669
04:40:23,940 --> 04:40:26,580
There's a little danger, watch behind you.

3670
04:40:26,880 --> 04:40:29,300
There's a stranger out to find you.

3671
04:40:29,660 --> 04:40:30,260
What to do?

3672
04:40:30,340 --> 04:40:32,860
Just grab onto some dovetails.

3673
04:40:34,520 --> 04:40:38,420
Every day they're out there making dovetails.

3674
04:40:39,920 --> 04:40:43,640
Tales of Deering, do bad, and good luck tales.

3675
04:40:43,660 --> 04:40:58,020
Every day they're out there making duck tails Tails, oh
dear, and do that and good luck tails Not ponytails or

3676
04:40:58,020 --> 04:41:02,840
cotton tails, no ducktails Yeah!

3677
04:41:06,990 --> 04:41:08,570
I wish they made more ducktails.

3678
04:41:09,710 --> 04:41:11,610
It was so good, the reboot.

3679
04:41:11,990 --> 04:41:14,270
Ooh, fucking fish, he cancelled it.

3680
04:41:15,610 --> 04:41:18,290
It was so, I love the reboot so much.

3681
04:41:18,870 --> 04:41:19,830
And like, what's his name?

3682
04:41:20,070 --> 04:41:21,410
Like, the Dr. Who guy?

3683
04:41:21,710 --> 04:41:24,190
He was so good at Scrooge McDuck.

3684
04:41:24,910 --> 04:41:25,230
I swear.

3685
04:41:25,350 --> 04:41:28,410
Like, I feel like he was like the perfect voice for him.

3686
04:41:28,590 --> 04:41:31,310
For Mr. Mc, like, yeah, David, yeah, David Tennant.

3687
04:41:31,750 --> 04:41:33,710
David Tennant was so good in it, too.

3688
04:41:33,810 --> 04:41:35,490
I'm so sad that they canceled it.

3689
04:41:35,590 --> 04:41:36,510
It was such a good show.

3690
04:41:37,630 --> 04:41:42,070
They were going to make dark, they were going to have
Darkwing Duck and then Disney canceled it.

3691
04:41:42,650 --> 04:41:45,050
Because they were supposed to be, they were going to make a
spin-off.

3692
04:41:45,610 --> 04:41:50,290
off of the DuckTales reboot or Darkwing Duck, but they were
like, nah in the end.

3693
04:41:52,370 --> 04:41:53,810
I thought it did really well.

3694
04:41:54,290 --> 04:41:56,750
Yeah, Darkwing Duck was in DuckTales.

3695
04:41:57,490 --> 04:42:02,490
They added a lot of the old classic characters into the
reboot, too.

3696
04:42:04,910 --> 04:42:05,790
It's really good.

3697
04:42:05,930 --> 04:42:08,650
I feel like every season just got better.

3698
04:42:09,430 --> 04:42:12,210
Yeah, David Tennant voices Scrooge McDuck.

3699
04:42:18,160 --> 04:42:19,700
It's Disney tradition.

3700
04:42:19,860 --> 04:42:21,780
I don't believe in that.

3701
04:42:22,280 --> 04:42:24,240
I think they just didn't merchandise it enough.

3702
04:42:24,840 --> 04:42:30,720
I think like companies usually always cancel shows when they
can't merchandise it enough.

3703
04:42:32,760 --> 04:42:36,320
I heard they're bringing, oh, I heard they're like rebooting
My Little Pony again.

3704
04:42:38,200 --> 04:42:44,160
And like, because they keep like, because they made it, for
those who didn't know, like, they've been trying to chase

3705
04:42:44,160 --> 04:42:53,220
the original My Little Pony high with the main six, but they
new generation and apparently it failed really badly so

3706
04:42:53,220 --> 04:43:02,400
they're rebooting the main six they're literally remaking
like like twilight sparkle and all all of them again i think

3707
04:43:02,400 --> 04:43:09,680
it's on the concept art phase they're like okay we're gonna
bring back the original six characters but what if twilight

3708
04:43:09,680 --> 04:43:22,140
was an earth pony instead of a unicorn and what if uh uh
pinky pie is a pegasus instead because pegasus um instead of

3709
04:43:22,140 --> 04:43:31,680
a uh uh earth pony oh no it's apparently it's gonna be
different animation style yeah they're remaking friendship

3710
04:43:31,680 --> 04:43:41,420
is magic but they're because they're like oh why is there
why is the the new generation not making as much money as

3711
04:43:41,420 --> 04:43:42,720
the main six

3712
04:43:47,240 --> 04:43:58,200
i can't believe weird out banged a pony and had kids For
those who don't know, Weird Al is an actual, like, like,

3713
04:43:58,900 --> 04:44:07,160
pony, so has his own pony sona in My Little Pony, and then
he marries Pinkie Pie, and then they had kids.

3714
04:44:13,060 --> 04:44:15,360
My Little Pony appears to just mad because of Uma Musume.

3715
04:44:15,740 --> 04:44:18,680
My Little Pony walked so Uma Musume could run.

3716
04:44:19,920 --> 04:44:23,840
Also, My Little Pony is incredibly popular right now in
Asia, especially in China.

3717
04:44:24,100 --> 04:44:26,320
So, like, I won't be surprised that they want to bring back.

3718
04:44:26,340 --> 04:44:37,060
friendship is magic just to capitalize on that because it's
insanely popular right now in China I'm too tired for this

3719
04:44:37,060 --> 04:44:59,880
lore It's the most wonderful time of the year I know a lot
of the Christmas songs from Glee too

3720
04:45:05,220 --> 04:45:18,560
It's the most wonderful time of the year With the kids
jingle belling And everyone telling you'd be of good cheer

3721
04:45:18,560 --> 04:45:32,620
It's the most wonderful time of the year It's the happiest
season season of all.

3722
04:45:33,280 --> 04:45:39,860
Ding, dong, with those holiday greetings and gay happy
meanings when friends come to call.

3723
04:45:41,360 --> 04:45:46,380
It's the happiest season of all.

3724
04:45:47,080 --> 04:45:47,480
Yay!

3725
04:45:48,280 --> 04:45:54,280
There'll be parties for hosting, marshmallows for toasting,
and caroling out in the snow.

3726
04:45:54,820 --> 04:45:55,420
Like right now!

3727
04:45:55,520 --> 04:45:59,800
There'll be scary ghost stories and tales of the glories of
Christmas.

3728
04:45:59,960 --> 04:46:01,380
Wait, we'll How did this go?

3729

05:00:41,380 --> 05:00:43,120
Yeah, say goodbye to dad.

3903
05:00:43,380 --> 05:00:44,520
He went back home now.

3904
05:00:47,300 --> 05:00:49,480
I'm already drunk because I'm fucking Asian.

3905
05:00:49,780 --> 05:00:50,420
That's why.

3906
05:00:50,760 --> 05:00:52,140
I didn't even drink that much yet.

3907
05:00:55,740 --> 05:00:57,600
I'm thinking what song I want to sing next.

3908
05:00:59,240 --> 05:01:01,320
What do I want to sing next, actually?

3909
05:01:03,500 --> 05:01:04,840
Oh, I have an idea.

3910
05:01:15,820 --> 05:01:23,700
no i'm not drunk yet don't worry kids i should actually
hydrate water

3911
05:01:29,940 --> 05:01:35,340
every day i imagine a future where i can be with you

3912
05:01:41,510 --> 05:01:44,930
Now write a poem of me and you

3913
05:01:48,370 --> 05:02:00,230
The ink flows down into a dark puddle Just move your hand
right the way into his heart But in this world of infinite

3914
05:02:00,230 --> 05:02:05,470
choices What will it take just to find that special day?

3915
05:02:06,770 --> 05:02:11,190
What will it take just to find that special day?

3916
05:02:11,510 --> 05:02:13,290
Yeah, dokey dokey.

3917
05:02:15,010 --> 05:02:18,890
Yeah, some people sometimes post like dokey dokey leisure
club fan art in our tag.

3918
05:02:19,030 --> 05:02:25,950
I guess I think it's the have I found everybody a fun
assignment to do the day.

3919
05:02:29,720 --> 05:02:34,700
When you're here, everything that we do is fun for them
anyway.

3920
05:02:38,780 --> 05:02:42,480
When I can't even read my own feelings.

3921
05:02:43,260 --> 05:02:46,460
What good are words when a smile says it all?

3922
05:02:48,020 --> 05:02:55,780
And if this world won't write me an ending, What will it
take just for me to have it all?

3923
05:03:00,740 --> 05:03:06,680
I swear, I saw that so many people, like not a lot, but it
would happen occasionally when I get like random dokey dokey

3924
05:03:06,680 --> 05:03:12,980
literature club stuff on my like fan tag or like merch tag

I'm going to write better words for those who are dear to
me.

3928
05:03:25,200 --> 05:03:26,300

3930
05:03:28,800 --> 05:03:30,240
If I set you free.

3931
05:03:38,900 --> 05:03:42,160
The ink flows down into a dark puddle.

3932
05:03:43,220 --> 05:03:46,320
How can I write love into reality?

3933
05:03:49,000 --> 05:04:01,840
the sound of your heartbeat what do you call loving your
reality your reality though I don't know how to love you

Thank you.

4034
05:12:35,100 --> 05:12:42,700
That's a classic song that was always playing during those
Christmas reruns on public TV television.

4035
05:12:45,220 --> 05:12:45,440
All right.

4036
05:12:45,520 --> 05:12:45,880
Let's see.

4037
05:12:45,900 --> 05:12:47,320
There's one song I really want.

4038
05:12:47,380 --> 05:12:47,540
Wait.

4039
05:12:47,620 --> 05:12:48,480
Did I have it?

4040
05:12:52,340 --> 05:12:54,040
You know what song I was hoping they have?

4041
05:12:54,380 --> 05:12:54,980
Britters or B?

4042
05:12:55,400 --> 05:12:57,100
Because I've been re-watching community.

4043
05:12:57,340 --> 05:13:00,000
I've been re-watching community in the office lately.

4044
05:13:01,000 --> 05:13:02,600
Getting rid of bigot up.

4045
05:13:03,100 --> 05:13:05,860
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

4046
05:13:07,700 --> 05:13:08,660
That sucks.

4047
05:13:09,140 --> 05:13:09,960
They don't have...

4048
05:13:09,960 --> 05:13:11,180
Getting rid of britta.

4049
05:13:13,540 --> 05:13:14,940
That's a good song.

4050
05:13:16,680 --> 05:13:18,460
What's this song that has a similar to?

4051
05:13:22,420 --> 05:13:26,360
What's the there's a song that's that's similar to that
tune.

4052
05:13:26,560 --> 05:13:27,840
That's actually really popular song

4053
05:13:33,200 --> 05:13:36,080
Oh, and then well no no no we can't sing that one.

4054
05:13:36,200 --> 05:13:42,480
There's too much history in there We didn't start the fire
We can't sing that

4055
05:13:46,820 --> 05:13:53,860
Too much history like too much history in there Let's see.

4056
05:13:56,960 --> 05:13:58,120
Sissies, mom.

4057
05:13:59,700 --> 05:14:00,240
Let's see.

4058
05:14:02,100 --> 05:14:02,660
Oh, wait.

4059
05:14:02,740 --> 05:14:04,120
Do they have this one?

4060
05:14:07,820 --> 05:14:08,240
Ah.

4061
05:14:09,200 --> 05:14:10,000
Wait.

4062
05:14:11,260 --> 05:14:14,000
Why do they have the German Digimon opening?

4063
05:14:15,920 --> 05:14:21,640
They have the German Digimon opening, but none of the
English ones?

4064
05:14:21,780 --> 05:14:22,320
Come on.

4065
05:14:22,340 --> 05:14:24,400
Come on, come on!

4066
05:14:24,740 --> 05:14:25,980
It is a classic.

4067
05:14:29,080 --> 05:14:30,540
I can't believe it.

4068
05:14:30,700 --> 05:14:32,740
They don't have like the...

4069
05:14:32,740 --> 05:14:34,340
Okay, do they have...

4070
05:14:34,980 --> 05:14:35,660
I wonder.

4071
05:14:40,210 --> 05:14:41,590
Nah, they don't.

4072
05:14:41,850 --> 05:14:42,490
What?

4073
05:14:42,830 --> 05:14:46,210
The English one was is peak too, guys.

4074
05:14:46,690 --> 05:14:48,910
The English one is also peak.

4075
05:14:49,270 --> 05:14:51,550
Why don't they have the Naruto German opening, huh?

4076
05:14:51,550 --> 05:14:52,550
If it's so peak.

4077
05:14:59,100 --> 05:15:00,960
It's perfect for me.

4078
05:15:06,600 --> 05:15:07,900
Alright, let's see.

4079
05:15:09,140 --> 05:15:11,560
I'm gonna see what other stuff I can sing.

4080
05:15:14,240 --> 05:15:15,440
They have this.

4081
05:15:15,820 --> 05:15:18,460
Oh my god, if they have this, I would be so excited.

4082
05:15:22,320 --> 05:15:23,780
Oh, they don't.

4083
05:15:23,860 --> 05:15:24,520
You know what I want?

4084
05:15:26,660 --> 05:15:28,300
I went and checked it.

4085
05:15:28,420 --> 05:15:29,780
They have Dora the Explorer.

4086
05:15:30,940 --> 05:15:36,500
Dora, Dora, Dora, Dora, Dora, Dora, Dora, Dora, Dora, the
explorer.

4087
05:15:39,440 --> 05:15:41,380
Oh my god, wait.

4088
05:15:42,680 --> 05:15:44,000
This is close enough.

4089
05:15:44,340 --> 05:15:45,280
This is close enough.

4090
05:15:45,540 --> 05:15:47,620
Okay, I should get the drink is hitting.

4091
05:15:47,740 --> 05:15:48,820
Okay, I'm getting drunk.

4092
05:15:48,980 --> 05:15:51,060
I'm actually, um, do you understand why?

4093
05:15:54,800 --> 05:15:56,560
Wait, is this actually?

4094
05:15:59,480 --> 05:16:00,760
Take your places.

4095
05:16:01,820 --> 05:16:02,020
Like.

4096
05:16:05,440 --> 05:16:08,060
Can we fix it?

4097
05:16:09,800 --> 05:16:11,260
Yes, we can!

4098
05:16:11,620 --> 05:16:15,080
Bob the Builder, can we fix it?

4099
05:16:15,760 --> 05:16:18,300
Bob the Builder, yes, we can!

4100
05:16:18,800 --> 05:16:21,640
Scoot, muck, and dizzy, and rolly, too.

4101
05:16:22,440 --> 05:16:25,300
Lopty and Wendy joined a crew.

4102
05:16:25,980 --> 05:16:28,940
Bob and the gang have so much fun.

4103
05:16:29,480 --> 05:16:32,440
Working together, they get the job done.

4104
05:16:32,520 --> 05:16:36,620
Bob the Builder, can we fix it?

4105
05:16:36,760 --> 05:16:39,880
Bob the Builder, yes we can!

4106
05:16:40,420 --> 05:16:43,780
Bob the Builder, can we fix it?

4107
05:16:44,040 --> 05:16:47,160
Bob the Builder, yes we can!

4108
05:16:49,620 --> 05:16:53,260
They have this one not Thor of the Explorer?

4109
05:16:53,920 --> 05:16:54,380
I don't know.

4110
05:16:54,800 --> 05:16:57,420
Time to get busy, such a lot to do.

4111
05:16:58,400 --> 05:17:01,000
Building and fixing, so it's good as new.

4112
05:17:02,520 --> 05:17:13,980
again we can really get sound working all day till the sun
goes down above the builder can we fix it above the builder

4113
05:17:13,980 --> 05:17:22,790
yes we can above the builder can we fix it above the
building yes we can

4114
05:17:32,790 --> 05:17:33,860
let's go

4115
05:17:38,540 --> 05:17:41,160
There's like this whole new song about it.

4116
05:17:41,320 --> 05:17:42,860
Okay, straight down.

4117
05:17:43,240 --> 05:17:44,360
I don't know this part.

4118
05:17:44,580 --> 05:17:45,880
There's no lead for this.

4119
05:17:45,980 --> 05:17:47,720
No, any situation.

4120
05:17:48,520 --> 05:17:49,020
Look out.

4121
05:17:49,400 --> 05:17:50,820
Here we come.

4122
05:17:51,940 --> 05:17:53,020
Can we...

4123
05:17:53,020 --> 05:17:54,500
Can we build it?

4124
05:17:54,560 --> 05:17:54,860
Yes!

4125
05:17:55,340 --> 05:17:56,320
Can we fix it?

4126
05:17:56,400 --> 05:17:56,720
Yes!

4127
05:17:59,020 --> 05:18:00,640
Bob the Builder.

4128
05:18:00,840 --> 05:18:02,580
Can we fix it?

4129
05:18:02,620 --> 05:18:04,160
Bob the Builder.

4130
05:18:04,420 --> 05:18:05,760
Yes, we can!

4131
05:18:06,300 --> 05:18:07,700
Bob the Builder.

4132
05:18:08,040 --> 05:18:09,820
Can we fix it?

4133
05:18:10,120 --> 05:18:13,020
Bob the Builder, yes we can!

4134
05:18:13,980 --> 05:18:16,420
King and mixing, having so much fun.

4135
05:18:16,960 --> 05:18:20,000
Working together, they get the job done.

4136
05:18:20,660 --> 05:18:21,760
Can we dig it, yes.

4137
05:18:22,260 --> 05:18:23,560
Can we build it, yes.

4138
05:18:24,060 --> 05:18:25,480
Can we fix it, yes.

4139
05:18:27,360 --> 05:18:30,740
Bob the Builder, yeah!

4140
05:18:31,420 --> 05:18:34,440
Bob the Builder, all together now.

4141
05:18:35,020 --> 05:18:38,020
Bob the Builder, can we fix it?

4142
05:18:38,040 --> 05:18:40,200
Can we fix it from the building?

4143
05:18:40,200 --> 05:18:40,520
Yes!

4144
05:18:41,120 --> 05:18:41,540
Yes!

4145
05:18:41,720 --> 05:18:42,900
We can!

4146
05:18:43,780 --> 05:18:47,260
Can we fix it from the building?

4147
05:18:48,080 --> 05:18:50,680
All of the building.

4148
05:18:51,200 --> 05:18:54,240
Can we fix it from the building?

4149
05:18:54,660 --> 05:18:56,140
Yes, we can!

4150
05:18:58,100 --> 05:18:58,580
Yay!

4151
05:19:02,740 --> 05:19:06,020
I was not expecting...

4152
05:19:06,020 --> 05:19:07,640
I legitimately was not...

4153
05:19:08,660 --> 05:19:10,380
expecting this sign to be in here.

4154
05:19:10,460 --> 05:19:12,100
I was just like fucking around.

4155
05:19:14,240 --> 05:19:14,820
Oh, wait.

4156
05:19:15,220 --> 05:19:15,600
Wait.

4157
05:19:15,880 --> 05:19:16,340
Here we go.

4158
05:19:16,600 --> 05:19:16,900
Here we go.

4159
05:19:17,160 --> 05:19:18,280
Merry Christmas, everyone.

4160
05:19:21,100 --> 05:19:21,680
Merry Christmas.

4161
05:19:24,020 --> 05:19:25,440
Oh, here I am in my tubby again.

4162
05:19:25,780 --> 05:19:28,660
My tubby's all filled with water and nice fluffy stuff.

4163
05:19:28,860 --> 05:19:31,660
And I got my soap and washcloth to wash myself.

4164
05:19:31,740 --> 05:19:34,900
And I got my nifty scrub brush to help me scrub my back.

4165
05:19:35,800 --> 05:19:38,020
And I got big fluffy towel to dry.

4166
05:19:38,040 --> 05:19:39,580
Drive myself when I'm done.

4167
05:19:39,900 --> 05:19:41,780
But there's no other thing that makes tubby time.

4168
05:19:41,940 --> 05:19:43,540
The very best time of the whole day.

4169
05:19:43,880 --> 05:19:44,880
And you know what that is?

4170
05:19:44,980 --> 05:19:47,120
It's a very special friend of mine.

4171
05:19:48,160 --> 05:19:50,220
My very favorite little pal.

4172
05:19:56,400 --> 05:19:59,420
Oh, rubber duckie, you're the one.

4173
05:20:00,380 --> 05:20:02,760
You make that time lots of fun.

4174
05:20:03,780 --> 05:20:06,980
Rubber duckie, I'm awfully fond of you.

4175
05:20:08,620 --> 05:20:12,340
Oh, rubber duckie, joy of joys.

4176
05:20:13,260 --> 05:20:15,580
When I squeeze you, you make some noise.

4177
05:20:16,420 --> 05:20:18,860
Rubber duckie, you're my very best friend.

4178
05:20:19,120 --> 05:20:19,500
It's true.

4179
05:20:21,340 --> 05:20:27,000
Oh, every day when I make my way to the tubby.

4180
05:20:30,660 --> 05:20:34,920
Yellow and chubby, rubber dada bitty.

4181
05:20:35,300 --> 05:20:37,720
Rubber duckie, you're so fun.

4182
05:20:38,300 --> 05:20:41,320
And I'm lucky that you're mine.

4183
05:20:42,160 --> 05:20:45,440
Rubber Ducky, I'm awfully fond of you.

4184
05:20:46,540 --> 05:20:47,060
Whoa!

4185
05:20:47,900 --> 05:20:51,760
Hey, rubber ducky, would you like me to scrub your back with
my nifty little scrub brush?

4186
05:20:52,060 --> 05:20:52,460
You would?

4187
05:20:52,740 --> 05:20:53,960
Okay, how's this?

4188
05:20:57,080 --> 05:20:58,620
Hey, you want me to scrub out your ears?

4189
05:20:58,700 --> 05:20:59,280
Oh, I see.

4190
05:20:59,560 --> 05:21:00,740
You don't even have any ears.

4191
05:21:00,940 --> 05:21:01,620
Oh, do you?

4192
05:21:02,460 --> 05:21:04,480
I'm like the drunk ad right now.

4193
05:21:05,180 --> 05:21:07,260
Bird, Fatoma, and Doki Ernie.

4194
05:21:08,040 --> 05:21:12,300
I'm, no, I think she's Ernie and I'm Bert.

4195
05:21:13,660 --> 05:21:17,660
Every day when I make my way to the tubby.

4196
05:21:19,600 --> 05:21:23,620
I buy a fella who's cute and yellow and chubby.

4197
05:21:24,320 --> 05:21:25,940
Rubber duck dub dubby.

4198
05:21:26,220 --> 05:21:28,520
Rubber ducky, you're so fun.

4199
05:21:28,960 --> 05:21:31,780
And I'm lucky that you're mine.

4200
05:21:32,240 --> 05:21:35,320
Rubber ducky, I like a whole pond of.

4201
05:21:35,500 --> 05:21:37,980
Rubber ducky, I'm awfully fun.

4202
05:21:38,040 --> 05:21:40,040
of you.

4203
05:21:48,560 --> 05:21:51,480
I can't believe they have that sock.

4204
05:21:51,900 --> 05:21:53,420
I was not expecting that.

4205
05:21:53,660 --> 05:21:55,060
I was like, what the fuck?

4206
05:21:55,620 --> 05:21:56,440
Rubber ducky.

4207
05:21:57,340 --> 05:21:57,400
.

4208
05:21:58,080 --> 05:21:58,720
.

4209
05:21:58,720 --> 05:21:59,220
.

4210
05:21:59,220 --> 05:21:59,400
.

4211
05:21:59,400 --> 05:21:59,660
.

4212
05:22:10,320 --> 05:22:28,080
I don't know the other wait what about okay yeah no they

sing that song though because like I don't remember how it

4214
05:22:35,300 --> 05:22:35,900
goes.

4215
05:22:37,280 --> 05:22:39,380
It ain't easy being green.

4216
05:22:42,200 --> 05:22:43,200
Fuck that.

4217
05:22:43,440 --> 05:22:46,920
I'm like, I'm sorry for the stream.

4218
05:22:47,600 --> 05:22:55,760
I'm like, oh, I don't have this song that I wanted.

4219
05:22:57,500 --> 05:22:58,800
Oh, wait, do they have this?

4220
05:23:07,090 --> 05:23:09,850
Wait, do they have...

4221
05:23:14,290 --> 05:23:16,490
Wait, I want to sing this song, though.

4222
05:23:17,350 --> 05:23:21,530
It has nothing to do with... Oh, I just realized I've been
singing songs that have nothing to do with Christmas.

4223
05:23:22,150 --> 05:23:24,030
I'll go back to Christmas, I swear to God.

4224
05:23:26,230 --> 05:23:29,090
I swear to God, I go back to Christmas, see.

4225
05:23:34,000 --> 05:23:35,440
I had too much silly juice.

4226
05:23:36,640 --> 05:23:37,140
I did.

4227
05:23:38,700 --> 05:23:39,880
I like this song.

4228
05:23:40,140 --> 05:23:41,080
I love this song.

4229
05:24:17,270 --> 05:24:19,110
I'm just grooving now.

4230
05:24:22,590 --> 05:24:25,590
It has a very long intro, but don't worry.

4231
05:24:25,910 --> 05:24:27,670
The payout is so worth it.

4232
05:24:39,210 --> 05:24:40,750
Come on, kids.

4233
05:24:41,110 --> 05:24:42,210
Come on, Timmy Yumi.

4234
05:24:42,830 --> 05:24:44,050
Jam along with me.

4235
05:24:44,570 --> 05:24:47,290
It has a long-ass intro, but it'll be worth it, guys.

4236
05:24:48,810 --> 05:24:50,190
It's mostly instrumental.

4237
05:24:50,530 --> 05:24:51,350
It's not tequila.

4238
05:24:57,360 --> 05:25:15,170
lyrics yeah we're almost there I don't know what about I'm
gonna miss my cue at this point I never miss it me yeah

4239
05:25:15,170 --> 05:25:25,710
everybody wants to be a cat because the cat's the only cat
but nowhere is that tell me everybody's picking up on that

4240
05:25:25,710 --> 05:25:29,990
Beeline beat, because everything else is obsolete.

4241
05:25:32,090 --> 05:25:34,970
Square with a horn makes you wish you weren't born.

4242
05:25:35,470 --> 05:25:45,110
Every time he plays, but with a square in the act, he can
set music back into the caveman days.

4243
05:25:45,190 --> 05:25:46,950
What's this about Bazaar?

4244
05:25:47,490 --> 05:25:50,770
Heard some corny birds who try to sing.

4245
05:25:51,230 --> 05:25:55,130
Still a cat's the only cat who knows how to swing.

4246
05:25:55,710 --> 05:25:59,570
He wants to dig a horn, a gig or something like that.

4247
05:26:00,090 --> 05:26:07,050
When everybody wants to be a cat, a square with a horn makes
you wish you weren't born.

4248
05:26:07,430 --> 05:26:12,930
Every time he plays, oh, a rinky dinky dinky with a square
in the act.

4249
05:26:13,250 --> 05:26:17,210
You can set music back to the caveman days.

4250
05:26:17,290 --> 05:26:28,530
Oh, rinky dinky dinky everybody wants to be a cat because a
cat's the only cat who knows where it's at when playing jazz

4251
05:26:28,530 --> 05:26:35,270
you always has a welcome mat because everybody digs a
swinging cat

4252
05:26:46,170 --> 05:26:54,970

4357
05:34:39,540 --> 05:34:41,180
His story not his glory.

4358
05:34:44,280 --> 05:34:45,460

4418
05:40:19,680 --> 05:40:22,140

lights and lashes sing we joyous all together heedless of

4430
05:41:27,680 --> 05:41:41,960
the wind and weather I remember there is one song that that
we forgot about which is a classic for us Oh, Seth

4431
05:41:41,960 --> 05:41:43,160

I was like, Seth MacFarlane sang a song.

4435
05:41:48,940 --> 05:41:49,700
What did he sing?

4436
05:41:51,520 --> 05:41:53,880
There's a Seth MacFarlane song in here.

4437
05:41:59,660 --> 05:42:01,020

4438

I'm looking through the list and, like, see shit like that.

4476
05:46:03,270 --> 05:46:04,790
Pink pony gum.

05:46:06,710 --> 05:46:11,050
Um, what do I want to sing?

4478
05:46:16,490 --> 05:46:18,770

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

4481
05:46:22,410 --> 05:46:23,730
Because I always sing the song.

4482

I had to pay the bills I have to pay.

4487
05:46:52,330 --> 05:46:53,510
Ain't it sad?

4488
05:46:54,850 --> 05:46:59,450
And still there never seems to be a single penny left for
me.

4489
05:47:00,030 --> 05:47:01,470
That's too bad.

4490
05:47:02,670 --> 05:47:06,210
In my dreams I have a plan.

4491
05:47:07,350 --> 05:47:26,390
If I got me a wealthy man, wouldn't have to work at all fool
around and have a ball money money money must be funny in

4492
05:47:26,390 --> 05:47:36,690
the rich man's world money money money always sunny in the
rich man's world.

4493
05:47:41,390 --> 05:47:49,870
All the things I could do, if I had a little money, it's a
rich man's world.

4494
05:47:50,370 --> 05:47:55,930
I always hum that song whenever we fucking play games, we
have to collect money in a rich man's world.

4495
05:47:59,450 --> 05:48:03,510
Men like that is hard to find, but I can't get him off my
mind.

4496
05:48:06,510 --> 05:48:11,570
And if he happens to be free, I bet he wouldn't fancy me.

4497
05:48:12,410 --> 05:48:13,970
That's too bad.

4498
05:48:15,210 --> 05:48:16,670
So I must leave.

4499
05:48:17,190 --> 05:48:22,270
I have to go to Las Vegas or Monaco.

4500
05:48:23,670 --> 05:48:27,730
When a fortune in a game, my life will never be the same.

She needed to come back down to Earth.

4627
05:58:32,720 --> 05:58:37,040
Five years from now, she sits at a home, feeding the baby.

I think I drank too much on the job.

5013
06:31:28,260 --> 06:31:32,500
But they always say, you always try your own product and
make sure it's okay, good.

5014
06:31:32,740 --> 06:31:33,120
You know?

5015
06:31:33,240 --> 06:31:34,380

And I brought...

5026
06:35:53,150 --> 06:35:57,910
Not only did I bring more water, but also brought more
alcohol.

5027
06:35:58,130 --> 06:35:59,370
It's a real Christmas party.

5028
06:36:00,350 --> 06:36:01,370
I've only had one cat.

5029
06:36:01,470 --> 06:36:03,150
This is my second cat, by the way.

5030
06:36:03,490 --> 06:36:06,150
And, like, for those who are worried about it, it's...

5031
06:36:06,150 --> 06:36:07,610
That's 5% alcohol.

5032
06:36:07,870 --> 06:36:09,250
But, like, I'm Asian, though, so it hits hard.

5033
06:36:09,270 --> 06:36:17,060
Okay, so I'm still on my first can.

5034
06:36:17,260 --> 06:36:19,680
I brought a second can just in case, you know, for
precaution.

5035
06:36:22,520 --> 06:36:25,680

On YouTube.

Wait, can my mods...

5050
06:37:45,920 --> 06:37:47,360
Wait, mods can make polls on Twitch.

5051
06:37:48,160 --> 06:37:49,260
A poll on Twitch.

5052
06:37:49,860 --> 06:37:52,720
Because my mods can make a poll on Twitch.

5053
06:37:52,840 --> 06:37:54,320
And I don't really want to make it right now.

5054
06:38:01,280 --> 06:38:03,040
Mods make a poll.

5055
06:38:03,500 --> 06:38:05,660
Fortnite or Minecraft.

5056
06:38:06,500 --> 06:38:07,420
On Twitch though.

5057
06:38:07,700 --> 06:38:08,900
To me shall decide.

5058
06:38:09,900 --> 06:38:10,740
Yimmy's fate.

5059
06:38:11,120 --> 06:38:13,740
Do you even do a pull on both?

5060
06:38:13,840 --> 06:38:17,160
Yeah, but then, like, it's easier if I just do it on one,
you know?

5061
06:38:17,360 --> 06:38:18,900
It's just easier in general.

5062
06:38:25,020 --> 06:38:25,720
Alright, mods.

5063
06:38:27,880 --> 06:38:29,280
Make that pull!

5064
06:38:33,900 --> 06:38:34,620
There we go.

5065
06:38:35,040 --> 06:38:35,620
Is it up?

5066
06:38:36,360 --> 06:38:37,840

Oh, I guess.

5074
06:38:57,810 --> 06:38:59,530
I guess I have to make my own.

5075
06:38:59,530 --> 06:39:02,390
I guess I have to make my own pull, I guess.

5076
06:39:02,930 --> 06:39:03,190
Alright.

06:39:03,610 --> 06:39:04,950

5977
07:53:49,700 --> 07:53:51,920

07:53:53,960 --> 07:53:55,260

5981
07:53:59,040 --> 07:54:03,900
I should keep me taking the 10 gifted subs like you think.

5982
07:54:04,160 --> 07:54:06,100

Oh my god, how the mighty have fallen.

5984
07:54:10,460 --> 07:54:13,660
I didn't fall once on that parkour.

5985
07:54:14,760 --> 07:54:16,560
What happened to me?

5986
07:54:20,900 --> 07:54:21,800

07:54:44,740 --> 07:54:46,300
We've done it before.

5995
07:54:48,440 --> 07:54:50,720

We have so many healers.

6639
09:01:01,070 --> 09:01:05,310
There's no way we can die with the amount of heals we have.

6640
09:01:07,010 --> 09:01:09,350
Look at these goddamn...

6641
09:01:11,050 --> 09:01:13,450
Don't mess with the amazing Spider-Man.

I want to know what the dragon was doing with the 999
frames.

6649
09:02:25,730 --> 09:02:33,910
Guys, if we all play Adam, just imagine, imagine like, how-
Oh, my God!

6650
09:02:35,850 --> 09:02:37,470
Bro, Becky, what the fuck?

09:02:37,810 --> 09:02:39,690
Bro, that shark literally killed everyone.

6652
09:02:43,590 --> 09:02:45,110
That shark killed everyone.

6653
09:02:46,450 --> 09:02:48,910
The Marble Slideshow.

6654
09:02:49,650 --> 09:02:51,230
Like, what's the point?

6655
09:02:51,570 --> 09:02:53,210
I don't even know.

6656
09:02:53,850 --> 09:02:56,470
I feel very nerfed right now.

6657
09:02:56,990 --> 09:03:04,150
Like, it's not even, it's not even, like, possible for me to
play.

6658
09:03:08,580 --> 09:03:14,920
Okay, surprisingly, I am surprised I got that amount of
kills.

6659
09:03:15,820 --> 09:03:19,060
How fucked, like, everything was.

6660
09:03:25,580 --> 09:03:29,000
I'm surprised I even got this amount of kills.

6661
09:03:37,980 --> 09:03:38,920
Oh, my God.

6662
09:03:39,120 --> 09:03:41,220
Like, the frame was crazy.

6663
09:03:44,740 --> 09:03:45,220
All right.

6664
09:03:45,360 --> 09:03:45,920
All right, guys.

6665
09:03:45,980 --> 09:03:46,860
I'll make another lob.

6666
09:03:46,940 --> 09:03:47,500
I want to do...

6667
09:03:47,500 --> 09:03:49,680
I don't know if I want to try that again, actually.

6668
09:03:51,720 --> 09:03:52,960
Don't know that.

6669
09:03:53,160 --> 09:03:56,660
Okay, I'm going to see if it's 18% 18 or it's just me.

6670
09:03:56,860 --> 09:03:57,660
Or if it's just me.

6671
09:03:57,720 --> 09:03:59,000
I'm going to try this real quick.

6672
09:03:59,480 --> 09:04:00,220
I got a no.

6673
09:04:00,560 --> 09:04:01,920
Because that was fucking crazy.

6674
09:04:02,240 --> 09:04:03,040
GG's, though.

6675
09:04:07,880 --> 09:04:09,340
I need a no.

6676
09:04:09,640 --> 09:04:13,300
Like, that shit was fucking weird as hell.

6677
09:04:14,660 --> 09:04:16,960
A perfect way to check up.

6678
09:04:18,480 --> 09:04:19,160
This is I thought.

6679
09:04:22,940 --> 09:04:23,620
I'm like...

6680
09:04:23,640 --> 09:04:25,600
I had like 70 frames.

6681
09:04:25,820 --> 09:04:27,000
I was like, whoa.

6682
09:04:27,580 --> 09:04:28,840
I'm like, yeah, I don't have.

6683
09:04:29,220 --> 09:04:30,480
How the fuck do I do that?

6684
09:04:35,400 --> 09:04:37,940
But like, I usually don't have that issue.

6685
09:04:38,200 --> 09:04:40,000
So I was like, what the fuck?

6686
09:04:40,220 --> 09:04:42,560
How do I have 70 frames?

6687
09:04:51,330 --> 09:04:55,510
Ooh, when I'm turning, it's like, maybe it's because I'm
dual streaming too.

6688
09:04:55,670 --> 09:04:57,330
I think it's also because I'm dual streaming.

6689
09:04:58,050 --> 09:05:09,430
Oh, yeah, no, I think it's also I'm also because I'm dual
streaming because me turning is also Yeah When I turn it

6690
09:05:09,430 --> 09:05:17,690
goes from a hundred to I think it's because I'm also multi
streaming Because usually I don't have that issue.

6691
09:05:17,830 --> 09:05:19,270
Yeah, it's the dual streaming.

6692
09:05:19,610 --> 09:05:23,770
I'm pretty sure The dual streaming has made it go to the 40

6693
09:05:30,020 --> 09:05:32,780
Oh, ah, oh, I'm sorry, it's so bad.

6694
09:05:32,980 --> 09:05:34,340
This is actually fucking gross.

6695
09:05:35,300 --> 09:05:37,280
For me, I'm not a fan.

6696
09:05:38,740 --> 09:05:41,300
I know you guys, like, I can see the difference.

6697
09:05:41,600 --> 09:05:43,600
It's a huge difference, yeah.

6698
09:05:44,660 --> 09:05:47,080
It's actually a huge fucking difference for me.

6699
09:05:48,800 --> 09:05:53,880
I don't know if it's noticeable on stream, but, like, I feel
like I'm...

6700
09:05:53,880 --> 09:05:56,860
I feel like I'm watching a slideshow right now on my end.

6701
09:05:58,060 --> 09:05:58,540
Yeah.

6702
09:06:00,440 --> 09:06:01,740
I think it's dual streaming.

6703
09:06:01,980 --> 09:06:04,440
Well, at least I know you can't dual stream Marvel Rivals.

6704
09:06:08,840 --> 09:06:08,940
Yeah.

6705
09:06:10,140 --> 09:06:15,480
No, it literally feels like I'm playing on a PowerPoint
right now for me.

6706
09:06:18,740 --> 09:06:19,820
Hey, I'm not...

6707
09:06:19,820 --> 09:06:22,480
Oh my god, this is so hard to aim.

6708
09:06:26,080 --> 09:06:27,800
Oh my god, you should have fucking been dead.

6709
09:06:28,460 --> 09:06:29,080
There you go.

6710
09:06:32,300 --> 09:06:32,860

6714
09:06:48,380 --> 09:06:50,340

6717
09:07:00,840 --> 09:07:04,460
like bro There's no way it's that that bad.

6718
09:07:04,860 --> 09:07:08,660
Like, I heard 18 versus 18 was such a popular game mode,
too.

6719
09:07:08,780 --> 09:07:11,040
So I was like, what the fuck?

6720
09:07:12,080 --> 09:07:14,680
I thought I was, like, so surprised.

6721
09:07:15,380 --> 09:07:20,860
I was like, it'll be cool if my team pushes forward.

6722
09:07:21,220 --> 09:07:22,740
Oh, no.

6723
09:07:23,960 --> 09:07:24,540
It wasn't.

6724
09:07:24,820 --> 09:07:27,540
Oh, my team didn't push forward.

6725
09:07:32,940 --> 09:07:33,380
Yeah.

6726
09:07:37,900 --> 09:07:38,780

What the fuck?

6733
09:07:53,970 --> 09:07:56,010
Yeah, no, I think...

6734
09:07:57,270 --> 09:08:00,750
The worst part is like... I mean, I could play Scarlet
Witch.

6735
09:08:03,630 --> 09:08:15,690
it might be easier to play scarlet witch for me right now

6741
09:09:07,780 --> 09:09:08,080
streaming.

6742
09:09:08,380 --> 09:09:09,280
Oh, we got the point?

6743
09:09:09,500 --> 09:09:10,480
Let's fucking go.

6744
09:09:13,220 --> 09:09:20,200
Oh, I got out of Invis, because I'm hoping that there you
go.

6745
09:09:21,020 --> 09:09:21,400
Hey, guys.

6746
09:09:21,560 --> 09:09:21,940
Oh, my God.

6747
09:09:22,080 --> 09:09:23,080
They're all stacked up again.

6748
09:09:23,420 --> 09:09:23,740
Are you?

6749
09:09:24,580 --> 09:09:25,280
I took out.

6750
09:09:25,380 --> 09:09:26,440
I took out that's fine.

6751
09:09:27,140 --> 09:09:27,460
I took out.

6752
09:09:27,460 --> 09:09:27,460
That's fine.

6753
09:09:27,460 --> 09:09:27,700
I took those.

6754
09:09:28,640 --> 09:09:29,080
Oh, my God.

6755
09:09:29,140 --> 09:09:30,420
I fucking knew he was going to do that, too.

6756
09:09:30,540 --> 09:09:31,540
That's why I fucking ran.

6757
09:09:31,640 --> 09:09:32,540
Oh, I still died.

6758
09:09:33,200 --> 09:09:33,200
Okay.

6759
09:09:35,800 --> 09:09:40,060
No, it feels like I'm I'm basically watching a PowerPoint
right now.

6760
09:09:41,720 --> 09:09:43,520
So it's like really weird.

6761
09:09:45,380 --> 09:09:48,500
Because I can tell the difference between frames.

6762
09:09:48,600 --> 09:09:50,440
Because I've been playing on high frames for so long.

6763
09:09:50,740 --> 09:09:54,320
Like the thing is, like when you go forward, you can't go
back.

6764
09:09:54,620 --> 09:09:56,100
You can't fucking go back.

6765
09:09:56,220 --> 09:09:58,320
It's actually, it sucks too.

6766
09:09:58,400 --> 09:10:00,980
Like, because like you're so used to playing high frames.

6767
09:10:01,300 --> 09:10:02,940
That every, it just feels like hell.

6768
09:10:03,280 --> 09:10:06,620
Like you don't know how good it is until it's gone type
deal.

6769
09:10:08,380 --> 09:10:13,280
it's literally like that you don't know how good it is until
you lose it

6770
09:10:21,150 --> 09:10:26,550
because it's like um because you can't you literally can't
go back

6771
09:10:29,630 --> 09:10:38,170
everything just looks like super slow afterwards I love
every person I can do this and do that

6772
09:10:41,640 --> 09:10:48,980
I think it's crazy that people are still like judging rivals
for being for the gooner skin when everyone's like it like

6773
09:10:48,980 --> 09:10:59,920
you know because it's like bro like we all know like what
what this game is like every everyone knows what Rattles is

6774
09:10:59,920 --> 09:11:07,500
it's been like a year now you're still judging the gooners
skins it's crazy people are like i'm so tired of these skins

6775
09:11:07,500 --> 09:11:13,180
being good i'm like it's been like that's just the beginning
of the game's launch what do you

6776
09:11:16,200 --> 09:11:21,780
change and we get gooner men and female skins bro

6777
09:11:26,300 --> 09:11:27,710
all right

6778
09:11:32,480 --> 09:11:44,560
oh i gotta kill him yeah weakling wait who's fucking still
oh he's all right there you go yeah that's that's crazy that

6779
09:11:44,560 --> 09:11:53,000
they're still like fucking saying shit about have like oh
man how dare how dare they release more gooner skins and i'm

6780
09:11:53,000 --> 09:11:53,600
like bro

6781
09:11:58,240 --> 09:12:10,900
it's been like that in the beginning bro gooner skin cell
they've always sold why do you think also wait actually why

6782
09:12:10,900 --> 09:12:20,360
actually no kiriko is like kiriko is like always sold no
matter what but it doesn't have to be gooner skin.

6783
09:12:20,900 --> 09:12:21,500
All right, guys.

6784
09:12:23,860 --> 09:12:24,820
Unfortunately, because...

6785
09:12:26,900 --> 09:12:30,460
Unfortunately, because I think it's because I'm dual
streaming.

6786
09:12:31,080 --> 09:12:32,480
No, it doesn't matter.

6787
09:12:32,760 --> 09:12:35,580
Because, like, I think it's just because I'm dual streaming
that...

6788
09:12:36,460 --> 09:12:38,220
That, like, my frames are going...

6789
09:12:38,220 --> 09:12:39,840
You know what I'm going to do?

6790
09:12:39,920 --> 09:12:40,620
I'm going to check.

6791
09:12:44,220 --> 09:12:46,400
No, my CPU and memory are fine.

6792
09:12:46,480 --> 09:12:48,620
I think it's literally just because of dual streaming.

6793
09:12:48,720 --> 09:13:00,880
though no i cannot i cannot play cop lobby like this like
it's actually it's so bad let me try this in practice i went

6794
09:13:00,880 --> 09:13:02,740
full screen

6795
09:13:08,620 --> 09:13:24,260
oh yeah no bro it dropped the 30 what the fuck i'm in the
practice range what is this loading what it fucking got the

6796
09:13:24,260 --> 09:13:25,840
30 at one point.

6797
09:13:27,620 --> 09:13:30,300
Am I fucking loading the Empire State Building?

6798
09:13:34,450 --> 09:13:37,600
How did it drop the 830?

6799
09:13:38,880 --> 09:13:39,620
Alright.

6800
09:13:41,060 --> 09:13:41,640
Alright.

6801
09:13:42,080 --> 09:13:44,000
I think we gotta get off.

6802
09:13:44,180 --> 09:13:45,260
It's been fun.

6803
09:13:45,420 --> 09:13:46,960
18 versus 18.

6804
09:13:47,660 --> 09:13:52,520
Maybe we'll try 18 versus 18 again next time when I'm not
dual streaming.

6805
09:13:53,120 --> 09:13:59,100
I'm loading to the fucking moon right now i'm loading like
other people's textures

6806
09:14:04,190 --> 09:14:05,630
that's crazy

6807
09:14:08,680 --> 09:14:17,340
no it would tell you if i have shaders loading but i
definitely don't all right you know it's been fun we had we

6808
09:14:17,340 --> 09:14:23,000
had two games it's been we tried our best guys we try your
best

6809
09:14:30,140 --> 09:14:39,980
I think it definitely made more sense why why it was like
that you want to say okay look I will you I will I will

6810
09:14:39,980 --> 09:14:45,900
entertain this I will boot up at Fortnite just because I

forgot his Fortnite password, so unfortunately he wasn't

6815
09:15:14,190 --> 09:15:17,050
able to get it.

6816
09:15:21,480 --> 09:15:23,720
He was literally like, I forgot my... He was so sad.

6817
09:15:23,820 --> 09:15:25,520
He was like, I forgot my Fortnite login.

6818
09:15:27,220 --> 09:15:38,000
Oh, yeah, mods, can you change my category real quick to

click what the fuck is this That's why I steal the brain

6822
09:16:18,340 --> 09:16:18,760

6823
09:16:18,860 --> 09:16:21,520

Look at my shoes, though.

6828
09:16:28,180 --> 09:16:28,980
Look at my shoes.

6829
09:16:29,640 --> 09:16:30,520
And then, wait.

6830
09:16:30,880 --> 09:16:31,300
I know what.

6831
09:16:31,360 --> 09:16:31,880
Look at this.

6832
09:16:31,940 --> 09:16:32,500
I have...

6833
09:16:38,760 --> 09:16:39,160
Okay.

6834
09:16:40,760 --> 09:16:41,580
I got this.

6835
09:16:56,390 --> 09:17:00,590
Rara, Rara, Rara, Rara, Rana, Rana, Rana, Rana.

6836
09:17:01,430 --> 09:17:13,550
no no no no oh me yeah no i i'm not surprised that i'm not
doing so well right now it's one or the other all right so

6837
09:17:13,550 --> 09:17:29,640
this is what i bought i bought snow miku and then i also
bought so i got this and then i also got doobab

6838
09:17:32,900 --> 09:17:46,520

then i also got oh wait what the fuck oh yeah we all okay

6839
09:17:46,520 --> 09:18:03,420
and then i had to buy this i i paid for this i also bought
the sponge bath things but but this is very important It's

6840
09:18:03,420 --> 09:18:06,940
very important and I think that that's everything.

6841
09:18:07,220 --> 09:18:09,000
That was everything that was important to me.

6842
09:18:09,380 --> 09:18:12,320
Oh, wait, I guess like emotes to it.

6843
09:18:12,760 --> 09:18:21,800
Wait Okay, I can't show too much, but there's the jellyfish
dance All right

6844
09:18:32,900 --> 09:18:33,940
Okay, shock time.

6845
09:18:35,100 --> 09:18:38,800
Oh, yeah, I show speeds in here now, but, like, I'm very
disappointed.

6846
09:18:39,200 --> 09:18:41,760
I thought it'd be cool.

6847
09:18:41,940 --> 09:18:43,180
Also, by the way, I have a creator code.

6848
09:18:43,660 --> 09:18:44,880
Please use my code.

6849
09:18:46,960 --> 09:18:54,480
So, I'm really disappointed in his skin, only because, like,
the emote's pretty bad.

6850
09:18:54,880 --> 09:18:55,500
I don't really...

6851
09:18:55,500 --> 09:18:57,780
Because he's so expressive as a person.

6852
09:18:59,960 --> 09:19:02,880
He's so expressive as a person, but the emote...

6853
09:19:02,900 --> 09:19:05,040
Oh yeah, K-pop Demon Hunter is back.

6854
09:19:05,180 --> 09:19:05,860
But I'm not K-pop.

6855
09:19:06,260 --> 09:19:07,100
I don't know.

6856
09:19:07,360 --> 09:19:12,140
I mean, I wish they had better emotes, though.

6857
09:19:14,720 --> 09:19:18,900
I mean, I think the songs were cool.

6858
09:19:19,520 --> 09:19:25,860
But like, I'm not like that obsessive over K-pop Demon
Hunter's.

6859
09:19:26,340 --> 09:19:32,480
I have seen the movie, but I'm not like one of those people
who are like, oh my god, I fucking love K-pop Demon Hunter.

6860
09:19:32,900 --> 09:19:39,280
I do like the movie, but I'm not, like, you know, I'm not,
like, super obsessed with it.

6861
09:19:43,230 --> 09:19:44,910
Oh, Stranger Things is back.

6862
09:19:47,350 --> 09:19:49,350
I heard, oh, Jinx is back.

6863
09:19:51,330 --> 09:19:52,010
Oh, the hammer.

6864
09:19:52,290 --> 09:19:53,650
Wait, isn't that the...

6865
09:19:56,470 --> 09:19:59,390
Oh, I wish this was, like, more arcane-y.

6866
09:19:59,910 --> 09:20:01,710
I like the arcane art style.

6867
09:20:04,250 --> 09:20:17,450
But this feels too fortnighty It feels a little too for Oh
that's cute What else Oh my god Santa Oh my god Sabrina

6868
09:20:17,450 --> 09:20:29,620
carpenter What other stuff do they have Yeah I think Oh look

I did.

6879
09:22:07,490 --> 09:22:08,470
I had my code up.

6880
09:22:08,530 --> 09:22:08,910
Don't worry.

6881
09:22:08,970 --> 09:22:09,770
I got it.

6882
09:22:10,130 --> 09:22:11,390
My code is on.

6883
09:22:12,850 --> 09:22:14,190
Okay, now you're making me paranoid.

6884
09:22:14,310 --> 09:22:15,430
Yes, my code is on.

6885
09:22:15,570 --> 09:22:15,750
All right.

6886
09:22:18,650 --> 09:22:19,950
Oh, my God.

6887
09:22:20,050 --> 09:22:21,230
Wait, I need to be...

6888
09:22:21,230 --> 09:22:22,090
I want to be the Joker.

6889
09:22:23,710 --> 09:22:24,730
I want to be the Joker.

6890
09:22:25,870 --> 09:22:26,670
And then...

6891
09:22:26,670 --> 09:22:27,350
All right, there we go.

6892
09:22:27,470 --> 09:22:28,510
This was what I had to buy.

6893
09:22:29,410 --> 09:22:31,170
This was what I needed to buy.

6894
09:22:34,190 --> 09:22:34,610
Nice.

6895
09:22:37,630 --> 09:22:38,870
With his crocs too.

6896
09:22:42,550 --> 09:22:45,030
With his fucking kicks.

6897
09:22:46,470 --> 09:22:47,810
Let's go.

6898
09:22:53,900 --> 09:22:55,340
With SpongeBob.

6899
09:22:57,740 --> 09:22:58,700
Oh my god.

6900
09:23:01,700 --> 09:23:02,080
Oh my god.

6901
09:23:02,080 --> 09:23:02,120

Okay, wait, wait, wait.

Okay, that works, that works.

6906
09:23:12,800 --> 09:23:15,080
One for life for Christmas.

6907
09:23:15,480 --> 09:23:16,120
There is

6908
09:23:31,540 --> 09:23:32,900

6909
09:23:32,900 --> 09:23:35,420

09:24:37,680 --> 09:24:38,940
Actually, no, I think...

6917
09:24:41,940 --> 09:24:45,860
I think Pickle Rick is a better backpack with the Joker.

6918
09:24:47,900 --> 09:24:50,740
Oh, Christmas is wonderful, isn't it?

6919
09:24:51,100 --> 09:24:52,240
It really is.

I love...

6921
09:24:54,180 --> 09:24:55,840
Merry Christmas, everyone.

6922
09:24:56,820 --> 09:24:59,440
I missed out on Among Us, okay?

6923
09:24:59,800 --> 09:25:01,800
It was when I wasn't...

6924
09:25:01,800 --> 09:25:03,640
I took a break.

6925
09:25:03,820 --> 09:25:05,560
I took a break from Fortnite.

6926
09:25:06,040 --> 09:25:08,860
missed out on Among Us and the repo, guys.

6927
09:25:09,280 --> 09:25:10,640
I'm so sad.

6928
09:25:12,720 --> 09:25:14,360
I'm so sad.

6929
09:25:14,500 --> 09:25:15,920
I missed out on Peek.

6930
09:25:18,360 --> 09:25:20,800
I was just so busy.

6931
09:25:21,300 --> 09:25:24,160
The one time I let my guard down.

6932
09:25:24,360 --> 09:25:25,820
The one time.

6933
09:25:27,680 --> 09:25:29,520
But I'm pretty sure people do dual streaming.

6934
09:25:29,780 --> 09:25:30,980
I mean, like non-VTubers.

6935
09:25:31,200 --> 09:25:38,100
I feel like VTubers who do dual streaming um a lot of them
don't play like intent like like really intense games like

6936
09:25:38,100 --> 09:25:46,240
like you know my rivals is like i will say it's not like
very optimized um it's not like incredibly optimized but and

6937
09:25:46,240 --> 09:25:53,320
it's very like cpu intensive too so like they don't it's
like i think like people who usually do dual streaming for

6938
09:25:53,320 --> 09:26:01,320
shit like that they'll have streaming pcs uh yeah i mean
sorry multi-streaming yeah they'll have definitely have like

6939
09:26:01,320 --> 09:26:13,100
a two do a pc setup and stuff which makes sense which makes
sense you know yeah right because it would help a lot yeah

6940
09:26:13,100 --> 09:26:20,560
because i have 50 90 and i have a lot i bought a lot of ram
before the ram thing happened before it happened i had i

6941
09:26:20,560 --> 09:26:35,780
bought a lot of ram i don't remember how much i have but it
was a lot um and i also have that 50 90 too so um it's just

6942
09:26:35,780 --> 09:26:44,540
not my pc it's literally like it's just too much i just need
a second pc for that yeah before the ram drought thank god

09:28:18,520 --> 09:28:19,520
The stream isn't ending yet.

6964

We still have, we still have, we're still hanging out.

6965

It's just, we're at the part where we're just, we're just

6966
09:28:26,580 --> 09:28:27,580
We're cooling down now.

6967
09:28:27,660 --> 09:28:29,200
We're cooling down from everything.

I'm vague posting.

6975
09:29:09,780 --> 09:29:12,440
It's called vague posting now, not sub-tweeting anymore.

6976
09:29:15,200 --> 09:29:17,180
It's been a very fun Christmas stream.

6977
09:29:18,200 --> 09:29:19,880
I feel like the...

6978
09:29:20,900 --> 09:29:21,940
The nine...

6979
09:29:21,940 --> 09:29:23,980
The ten hours passed by...

6980
09:29:23,980 --> 09:29:25,780
That's crazy that we didn't lag on Roblox.

6981
09:29:25,940 --> 09:29:26,940
Roblox was like our...

6982
09:29:26,940 --> 09:29:28,860
Our least laggy game.

6983
09:29:29,140 --> 09:29:29,780
Oh, yeah.

6984
09:29:29,860 --> 09:29:31,500
I'm park or civilization.

6985
09:29:37,500 --> 09:29:46,120
um but it's been fun the powers really did pass by so much
and i hope for those who are spending their holidays their

6986
09:29:46,120 --> 09:29:55,460
christmas with with us here with the dragons um had a great
time hanging out uh today with us um i think this is the

6987
09:29:55,460 --> 09:30:01,320
longest christmas stream i've done so far so um yeah It
really was.

6988
09:30:01,440 --> 09:30:02,900
It was really really fun.

6989
09:30:03,280 --> 09:30:05,220
I am cooling down right now.

6990
09:30:05,860 --> 09:30:06,340
Oh, yes.

6991
09:30:07,140 --> 09:30:08,400
There's something I actually really want to do.

6992
09:30:08,440 --> 09:30:15,960
I want to do some New Year's resolutions with you guys
because this project that we will have a New Year's

6993
09:30:15,960 --> 09:30:18,840
countdown stream and everything.

6994
09:30:19,620 --> 09:30:26,700
But with a special project for New Year's, we won't have
time to do New Year's resolutions.

6995
09:30:27,520 --> 09:30:29,000
So I'll do it now.

6996
09:30:32,460 --> 09:30:43,860
um there's one thing i really want and that is easily one
million subscribers by the end of 2026 it's a huge goal um

6997
09:30:43,860 --> 09:30:53,560
but 2026 i'm planning on you know getting back into kick of
things uh getting back into gear because i i have been slack

6998
09:30:53,560 --> 09:31:05,880
i i personally think i was slacking this year I focused more
so on doing conventions and doing convention sponsors and

6999
09:31:05,880 --> 09:31:13,200
joining other people's events and not doing stuff, you know,
not doing stuff on my own channel.

7000
09:31:15,060 --> 09:31:17,140
And, you know, I don't put that next year.

7001
09:31:17,240 --> 09:31:25,220
I want to be much more productive when it comes to like
building up my own channel and building up my own, I guess

7002
09:31:25,220 --> 09:31:25,960
my...

7003
09:31:26,060 --> 09:31:32,840
Uh, my channeling in and building up my, what's the word, my
scope, I guess.

7004
09:31:37,140 --> 09:31:41,400
Um, I don't try to get, I'm trying to like figure out the
wording for it.

7005
09:31:41,600 --> 09:31:45,320
I guess building up my, my reach, I guess.

7006
09:31:45,580 --> 09:31:47,060
My global reach and stuff.

7007
09:31:47,760 --> 09:31:51,520
And also I want to collab with more, I want to collab with
new people next year.

7008
09:31:51,520 --> 09:31:58,380
I want to make new friends and I want to collab with more
people next year.

7009
09:31:58,480 --> 09:31:59,940
Oh, yeah, building up my brand more.

7010
09:32:00,140 --> 09:32:01,660
Yeah, yeah, I like that.

7011
09:32:02,560 --> 09:32:13,600
And also, I want to next year focus on collabing with new
people at least every other week, I think.

7012
09:32:13,660 --> 09:32:16,460
I want to try doing that and making more new friends.

7013
09:32:18,360 --> 09:32:21,500
Because I know this year, I was very closed off.

7014
09:32:21,520 --> 09:32:32,700
I was very very closed off in general because like you know
after everything that's happened I was very you know I

7015
09:32:32,700 --> 09:32:40,680
didn't really want to I was too scared to really interact
with people outside outside the people that like you know I

7016
09:32:40,680 --> 09:32:48,940
was already really close with but I want to interact with
more people next year but I still be careful I'll still be

7017
09:32:48,940 --> 09:32:55,820
careful because like I said you know I still have trust
issues and at best I just won't tell people things I think

7018
09:32:55,820 --> 09:33:06,600
that's the easiest no that one collab a week thing fucking
burns me out so hard because like I was so fucking tired um

7019
09:33:06,600 --> 09:33:14,700
because it was just way too many collabs um I'm not gonna do
that I'm gonna be like every other week because I do like

7020
09:33:14,700 --> 09:33:23,140
solo streams I really like solo streams because I just like
hanging out with my dragons um I just bantering with you

7021
09:33:23,140 --> 09:33:24,180
guys and everything

7022
09:33:29,450 --> 09:33:37,470
and aim for every other week I think every other week is
much more ideal than I think for like the first half of the

7023
09:33:37,470 --> 09:33:43,890
year because like you know trying to collab with new people
like the entire year is like unfeasible it's unrealistic

7024
09:33:43,890 --> 09:33:49,770
because there's like you know there's not enough people I
mean there is a lot of people around like in content

7025
09:33:49,770 --> 09:33:55,950
creation but you know what I mean is I want to be I still
want to be careful with who I interact with like who I want

7026
09:33:55,950 --> 09:33:58,150
to do stuff with and things.

7027
09:33:58,610 --> 09:34:02,030
And I still want to, you know, it also depends on like
chemistry wise as well.

7028
09:34:02,210 --> 09:34:06,430
Like, you know, I don't want to like force a collab with
someone that might not have good chemistry with.

7029
09:34:07,250 --> 09:34:11,930
So like maybe for the first half of the year, I'm going to
try and do a collab every other week.

7030
09:34:12,270 --> 09:34:15,510
And then also, you know, a million subscribers, a million
subscribers.

7031
09:34:16,070 --> 09:34:17,110
I mean, I should write this down.

7032
09:34:17,350 --> 09:34:18,970
I'm going to write this down real quick.

7033
09:34:19,690 --> 09:34:20,810
I want to make pasta too.

7034
09:34:20,970 --> 09:34:25,010
I'm like, I should head to bed right away, but I really want
to pasta.

7035
09:34:29,030 --> 09:34:34,810
one oh wait that's true i actually wrote one million
subscribers

7036
09:34:39,590 --> 09:34:56,370
these are my new years one million subscribers what else um
oh my god guys okay i know i have a stream tomorrow but like

7037
09:34:58,810 --> 09:35:00,310
I canceled a stream.

7038
09:35:00,570 --> 09:35:08,450
Yes last week too I might push the stream Yeah, dr. Evil
cook

7039
09:35:12,110 --> 09:35:16,470
Okay, I'm gonna I might push the stream later.

7040
09:35:16,970 --> 09:35:25,590
I think I might push the stream a little like an hour later
I feel bad because I already canceled a stream I know it's

7041
09:35:25,590 --> 09:35:26,210
okay guys.

7042
09:35:26,270 --> 09:35:29,130

7043
09:35:29,630 --> 09:35:30,450
It's okay.

7044
09:35:30,610 --> 09:35:36,230
I feel bad because I already canceled a stream last week
too, but I think it'd be better if I push it an hour later

7045
09:35:36,230 --> 09:35:38,670
just because like I'm thinking about timing and stuff.

7046

overwhelmed with everything that i literally just couldn't i
could die i was so tired there's way there was just so much

7080
09:39:18,500 --> 09:39:19,300
going on.

7081
09:39:21,660 --> 09:39:23,220
I was always playing catch-up.

7082
09:39:23,440 --> 09:39:23,860
That's the thing.

7083
09:39:24,020 --> 09:39:31,380
I was always playing catch-up, so I never really had the
time to actually focus on anything, because I'm always,

7084
09:39:31,400 --> 09:39:34,900
like, I'm always, like, trying to catch up.

7085
09:39:39,360 --> 09:39:40,840
Uh, what else?

7086
09:39:42,160 --> 09:39:44,020
What else do I want to accomplish?

7087
09:39:44,580 --> 09:39:45,180
Oh!

7088
09:39:46,360 --> 09:39:58,460

7094
09:41:07,380 --> 09:41:10,680
I said I gave him permission to use me as clickbait, guys.

7095
09:41:16,630 --> 09:41:19,230
Are my songs not on YouTube music for covers?

7096
09:41:20,930 --> 09:41:23,530
I put in the YouTube music category.

7097
09:41:29,910 --> 09:41:32,190
I don't know if there's anything else I want to aim for.

7098
09:41:41,400 --> 09:41:42,220
Not really.

7099
09:41:42,980 --> 09:41:45,720
There's not really merch goals, I feel.

7100
09:41:46,200 --> 09:41:47,880
Oh, wait, actually there is one.

7101
09:41:50,860 --> 09:41:51,380
Get...

7102
09:41:51,520 --> 09:41:55,560
And gaming jokie bird mouse pad.

7103
09:41:55,760 --> 09:41:56,280
This one.

7104
09:41:56,800 --> 09:41:58,260
That's the one thing I would like.

7105
09:41:59,060 --> 09:42:00,400
I would actually use it.

7106
09:42:00,580 --> 09:42:02,720
I usually use the xian.

7107
09:42:03,460 --> 09:42:07,380
I use the hian gaming mouse pad.

7108
09:42:08,000 --> 09:42:10,080
But it would be really cool.

7109
09:42:10,240 --> 09:42:12,660
So yeah, gaming jokie bird mouse pad.

7110
09:42:13,380 --> 09:42:14,160
And it would be cool.

7111
09:42:14,360 --> 09:42:16,040
I don't know how many people would actually use it.

7112
09:42:16,220 --> 09:42:18,640
But it doesn't help a lot when it comes.

7113
09:42:18,640 --> 09:42:20,360
For those who are actually...

7114
09:42:20,360 --> 09:42:29,160
uh for those who are actually are serious about like fps
games or gaming gaming in general um gaming mouse pads do

7115
09:42:29,160 --> 09:42:41,640
help a lot it really does uh improve your aim i hope more
people would buy it than dog shirts yeah

7116
09:42:49,220 --> 09:42:56,180
cloth or glass though i mean it depends on which company
hits me up i fucking will say yes to company that I just

7117
09:42:56,180 --> 09:43:03,860
haven't had an offer yet I haven't had a company I've been
trying to like I try to like ask uh I've been like my

7118
09:43:03,860 --> 09:43:10,580
manager and I have been like trying to get wall hack but
they've been like saying no because they don't know how much

7119
09:43:10,580 --> 09:43:18,320
it'll sell so then at that point I'll take anyone that
wouldn't make a gaming mouse bad I

7120
09:43:27,850 --> 09:43:40,010
just haven't been successful because we've been we like to
have a wall hack custom gaming mouse pad but um like i said

7121
09:43:40,010 --> 09:43:50,870
like it's very you know people are scared like it's like a
risk you know that's why i was like uh which whichever

7122
09:43:50,870 --> 09:43:56,410
gaming mouse pad company wants to make me a custom gaming
mouse pad i'll just say yes to it

7123
09:44:02,580 --> 09:44:08,440
i want to hold in uh I do, yeah, because like, you know...

7124
09:44:10,940 --> 09:44:17,580
It made more sense for like pro gamers to have a gaming
mouse pads, you know, but like for me, since I am a VTuber,

7125
09:44:17,640 --> 09:44:23,680
I mean, I do play FPS games, but even then it's like a niche
within a niche type deal, you know?

7126
09:44:25,000 --> 09:44:26,900
It's like a niche within a niche.

7127
09:44:34,170 --> 09:44:40,290
Also like, the hardest part is like I would like to go with
an American company.

7128
09:44:41,290 --> 09:44:43,910
Only because of terrorists.

7129
09:44:48,690 --> 09:44:51,870
That's like my only concern.

7130
09:44:54,790 --> 09:44:55,790
It's terrible, sir.

7131
09:44:56,230 --> 09:45:00,630
Because I know that I do have a lot of American dragons.

7132
09:45:02,590 --> 09:45:06,470
And like, yeah, no, it's really, yeah.

7133
09:45:07,030 --> 09:45:07,850
The thing, yeah.

7134
09:45:09,190 --> 09:45:10,870
Yeah, the terrorists are...

7135
09:45:10,930 --> 09:45:22,310
fucked I mean if it was a Canadian company the rest of the
world will be happy

7136
09:45:26,850 --> 09:45:35,050
that's the biggest issue it's so it sucks because it's like
it's like if it's Canada then the rest of the world will be

7137
09:45:35,050 --> 09:45:49,030
happy but it was in America then it's like uh it's like
American goons will be happy oh 3d debut I gotta work on the

7138
09:45:49,030 --> 09:45:57,430
3d debut I have not finished play I put I had to I had to
put it on what's the word 3d debut that's why we haven't had

7139
09:45:57,430 --> 09:46:05,470
sorry the RGB every time I press a key that's why we haven't
I had I want to use my 3d model but I'm waiting until I have

7140
09:46:05,470 --> 09:46:12,930
my actual official 3d debut to actually use it but it's been
like put I like have to bench it for a little bit um because

7141
09:46:12,930 --> 09:46:17,650
of everything that's going on I've zero like it's been on
hold because I had to do other stuff as well that's what i'm

7142
09:46:17,650 --> 09:46:29,290
saying i was so overworked and so overwhelmed this year um
that that had to bench a lot of stuff on hold um because of

7143
09:46:29,290 --> 09:46:38,350
it because i was just i just didn't have like the i didn't
have like the mental space or like the motivation to do a

7144
09:46:38,350 --> 09:46:49,080
lot of stuff because i was always like playing catch up like
i'm slowly getting better like 2026 is where like i start

7145
09:46:49,080 --> 09:46:56,540
locking in more like this year i'm still i feel like i'm
still like relaxing a little bit too um i did go outside the

7146
09:46:56,540 --> 09:47:04,020
last couple of days uh because i wanted to enjoy life a
little bit more i i want to try i think like in 2027 i do

7147
09:47:04,020 --> 09:47:11,920
want to travel more i want to get to a million subscribers
next year and then 2027 will be where i relax a bit more and

7148
09:47:11,920 --> 09:47:21,800
i want to start traveling i want to start traveling and like
meeting people in real life because i know like mint she

7149
09:47:21,800 --> 09:47:28,380
travels so much and she's always meeting people and she's
always doing stuff with people real life and everything and

7150
09:47:28,380 --> 09:47:35,320
i envy that a lot because like i also am like super paranoid
when it comes to traveling but i know like for her she's

7151
09:47:35,320 --> 09:47:44,320
like more outgoing about stuff like that and I want to I
want to start traveling more in 2027

7152
09:47:51,900 --> 09:48:00,920
I do have the street fighter tour I do in Japan I forgot
when is that because they haven't they haven't like told us

7153
09:48:00,920 --> 09:48:11,180
about I already forgot when that is I know I do I just
forgot when that is she asked me to go to she asked me well

7154
09:48:11,180 --> 09:48:16,540
she didn't ask me to go to holiday Missouri but like she
like I guess it's like implied like, oh, are you going like,

7155
09:48:16,600 --> 09:48:20,540
you know, like I said like an open invitation and I was
like, oh, no, no, no, I'm not going.

7156
09:48:22,800 --> 09:48:32,520
It was like a like a like a open like directly asked me, but
for holiday in Missouri, she like implied it like, do you

7157
09:48:32,520 --> 09:48:33,100
want to come?

7158
09:48:33,540 --> 09:48:35,120
Like, but I was like, no.

7159
09:48:36,140 --> 09:48:43,240
It was also like, cause like, you know, I was already super
busy too around that time and I wanted to like stay at home.

7160
09:48:56,410 --> 09:48:57,370
What else?

7161
09:48:57,530 --> 09:48:58,970
What else do I want to work for?

7162
09:48:59,310 --> 09:49:02,090
I think these are all like very feasible goals too.

7163
09:49:10,550 --> 09:49:12,450
Wait, when is the...

7164
09:49:14,010 --> 09:49:15,450
When is the...

7165
09:49:20,630 --> 09:49:23,030
The Japan trip, anyway, guys.

7166
09:49:27,690 --> 09:49:28,890
When is the Japan trip?

7167
09:49:31,190 --> 09:49:32,950
I never thought about voicing a video game.

7168
09:49:32,970 --> 09:49:35,270
I mean, if the opportunity ever presents itself.

7169
09:49:36,210 --> 09:49:37,650
I mean, I wouldn't say no to it.

7170
09:49:39,390 --> 09:49:40,270
I haven't got any...

7171
09:49:40,270 --> 09:49:41,670
I mean, I got offers for like...

7172
09:49:41,670 --> 09:49:44,350
Like, super indie stuff.

7173
09:49:45,550 --> 09:49:46,050
Um...

7174
09:49:46,050 --> 09:49:47,970
I haven't accepted any of them.

7175
09:49:48,490 --> 09:49:50,410
Um, only because it's like...

7176
09:49:50,910 --> 09:49:51,410
Uh...

7177
09:49:51,930 --> 09:49:53,790
Like, like, super, super indie.

7178
09:49:53,870 --> 09:49:54,890
Like, you know, like...

7179
09:49:54,890 --> 09:49:55,550
Like...

7180
09:49:56,350 --> 09:49:57,350
Like, 10...

7181
09:49:57,350 --> 09:49:58,890
Like, you know, like...

7182
09:49:58,890 --> 09:49:59,790
Very, very...

7183
09:50:00,950 --> 09:50:01,450
Very...

7184
09:50:02,450 --> 09:50:02,950
Like...

7185
09:50:02,970 --> 09:50:04,350
I don't know what's going on.

7186
09:50:13,500 --> 09:50:19,660
Oh yeah, no, the Pokemon MV, there was, it's out of my
hands.

7187
09:50:19,880 --> 09:50:26,080
It's literally because the 3D animator, like, personal life
got in the way for the 3D animator.

7188
09:50:26,540 --> 09:50:29,240
And I've always said, like, when it comes to, like, stuff
like that.

7189
09:50:30,040 --> 09:50:32,260
Yeah, it was like, it was like, the offers were sus, too.

7190
09:50:32,340 --> 09:50:34,660
Like, the, the voice acting brings to it.

7191
09:50:34,740 --> 09:50:39,960
So that's why I was like, oh, I don't, yeah, I mean, I'm
going to say, I'm not going to agree to this because it

7192
09:50:39,960 --> 09:50:41,140
feels pretty suspicious.

7193
09:50:42,160 --> 09:50:50,440
But yeah, like the reason why the Pokemon MV never got
published is because the 3D animator had, I don't know

7194
09:50:50,440 --> 09:50:51,140
what's going on.

7195
09:50:51,220 --> 09:50:54,460
I didn't pry about it because it's like their personal life.

7196
09:50:55,560 --> 09:51:00,700
So they just said that like personal life is in the way
right now, like getting in the way.

7197
09:51:02,080 --> 09:51:06,240
And because of that, I haven't got any updates on the
Pokemon.

7198
09:51:06,360 --> 09:51:14,100
MV but I'm not gonna rush it like you know you can't really
avoid personal life um so I think they like they basically

7199
09:51:14,100 --> 09:51:21,920
got another animator to work on it now but even then like
obviously like the final stuff is like up to them so it's

7200
09:51:21,920 --> 09:51:30,380
like whenever they're whatever whatever they're dealing with
personally personal life wise um um it'll be finished by for

7201
09:51:30,380 --> 09:51:38,860
it but that's why it's been like on hold for so fucking long
i feel really bad because like um you saw and got like uh

7202
09:51:38,860 --> 09:51:43,620
really annoyed at first about it because you're like what
the fuck is going on and i'm like i'm so sorry like it's

7203
09:51:43,620 --> 09:51:50,880
literally out of my hands so then they understand because
like i didn't tell i didn't update them about like what was

7204
09:51:50,880 --> 09:51:55,660
like because like i was like oh next time i got an update
i'll update you and obviously i didn't get an update so

7205
09:51:55,660 --> 09:52:00,020
they're like what the fuck like Like, is the music video
canceled?

7206
09:52:00,680 --> 09:52:04,740
Like, I felt really bad because I was like, I'm sorry.

7207
09:52:04,840 --> 09:52:07,700
The reason why I didn't update you is because, like, there
is no update.

7208
09:52:14,970 --> 09:52:18,090
But I understood after, like, I told them why.

7209
09:52:34,810 --> 09:52:36,370
A few more cherry goes to...

7210
09:52:36,370 --> 09:52:36,910
Oh, yeah.

7211
09:52:37,310 --> 09:52:40,190
The only thing is that there are some goals that...

7212
09:52:40,190 --> 09:52:45,550
Obviously, there might be some goals that I might not be
able to do anymore.

7213
09:52:47,470 --> 09:52:58,450
but I'll think of alternatives to it but I'll try and think
of alternatives to some of them new outfits?

7214
09:52:58,690 --> 09:53:03,250
Nope, there's always gonna be new outfits there's always
gonna be new outfits

7215
09:53:07,470 --> 09:53:17,070
um the thing is like um I will have I think everyone sort of
knows this because like you know my uh my rigor she's like

7216
09:53:17,070 --> 09:53:28,210
obviously super popular you know she's like she's like the
the most sought after youtuber uh rigor now so uh because of

7217
09:53:28,210 --> 09:53:37,670
that all of us i say this before it but all of us only has
like one new outfit per year now because she's not accepting

7218
09:53:37,670 --> 09:53:45,810
new clients still um she's not accepting new clients anymore
so it's just like building off of building off of what she

7219
09:53:45,810 --> 09:53:57,610
has now and because of that she only can take one new outfit
per year so that it's fair for everyone um and um but but

7220
09:53:57,610 --> 09:54:08,130
she told me that uh she gave me a uh she she's gonna give me
a list of people who are who she will allow to work on her

7221
09:54:08,130 --> 09:54:15,270
files because obviously you know um i wanted to be
comfortable because like she was like oh you can get someone

7222
09:54:15,270 --> 09:54:25,090
to rig your your skin suit with uh with new outfits if you
want to get more than one and i was like no no no it's fine

7223
09:54:25,090 --> 09:54:32,590
like i want to work i like obviously like it'll feel so
fucking weird too because like each um each person has their

7224
09:54:32,590 --> 09:54:40,390
own unique style especially you know cilia is mostly known
for her the mouth movements and everything so i don't want

7225
09:54:40,390 --> 09:54:46,350
to like you know i don't want to like it's so expressive and
everything so i didn't want to go through that route I'd

7226
09:54:46,350 --> 09:54:49,330
rather just, like, keep, at least keep the expressiveness.

7227
09:54:49,970 --> 09:54:57,670
And then she's going to, she's giving me a list of people
that she is comfortable with working on her files.

7228
09:54:58,190 --> 09:55:00,150
So they're just, like, they keep the face.

7229
09:55:00,690 --> 09:55:03,370
Mostly keep the face because it's her work.

7230
09:55:03,910 --> 09:55:07,910
And then they will work on, like, the hair and, like, the
outfits and stuff.

7231
09:55:13,290 --> 09:55:14,990
So I can get more than one outfit.

7232
09:55:15,090 --> 09:55:19,070
Because I've always, I want, you know, I like having lots of
new outfits.

7233
09:55:19,970 --> 09:55:24,910
um and i wanna i wanna be able to you know debut more than
one

7234
09:55:28,030 --> 09:55:41,330
i want to be able to debut more than one obviously um also
oh my gosh wait i said also oh i want to host an outfit

7235
09:55:41,330 --> 09:55:50,170

basically all any outfits i want to make to an actual

7236
09:55:50,170 --> 09:55:50,850
official outfit.

7237
09:55:51,050 --> 09:55:52,530
Like, not like there's no first, second, and third.

7238
09:55:52,910 --> 09:56:00,030
I want to make it so that, like, any outfit that I want to
make an official outfit will get, like, prize.

7239
09:56:00,850 --> 09:56:03,250
Yeah, I want to host an outfit contest next year.

7240
09:56:04,190 --> 09:56:05,630
I want to, I've been wanting to do that.

7241
09:56:05,810 --> 09:56:10,790
I don't know about, I'll do a, so I definitely want to do
that for sure next year.

7242
09:56:12,950 --> 09:56:15,850
I want, I like seeing what you guys come up with.

7243
09:56:16,510 --> 09:56:19,510
Because we have a lot of really creative, talented dragons
here.

7244
09:56:29,670 --> 09:56:38,890
now now now I don't know what the prize would be though

7245
09:56:42,620 --> 09:56:48,380
obviously there'll be prize money but like I mean like what
how much how much I will be investing in it

7246
09:56:57,160 --> 09:57:04,160
um I only have any other goals I think those are some of the
stuff I want to aim for I don't want to have too many New

7247
09:57:04,160 --> 09:57:07,600
Year's resolution stuff because like then it'll be too much
to aim for.

Oh my gosh.

7268
09:57:51,010 --> 09:57:53,390
I am definitely...

7269
09:57:54,270 --> 09:57:56,810
I'm definitely crashing now.

7270
09:57:59,730 --> 09:58:03,450
I am sobering up really fast.

7271
09:58:12,660 --> 09:58:14,640
I'm energy going down.

7272
09:58:15,240 --> 09:58:15,500
Down.

7273
09:58:16,380 --> 09:58:16,660
Down.

7274
09:58:16,980 --> 09:58:18,380
I'm so impostered though.

7275
09:58:22,360 --> 09:58:26,160
I still want my pasta

7276
09:58:31,530 --> 09:58:49,010
Oh my god Fucking Oh guys you guys know why Okay okay
apparently The reason why Wait is this real Oh my god So the

7277
09:58:49,010 --> 09:58:54,130
reason why everyone led face clan is because Aiden Ross

09:58:55,190 --> 09:58:56,710
That's so funny.

7279
09:58:57,650 --> 09:59:00,130
That's why everyone fucking left.

7280
09:59:02,050 --> 09:59:02,330
Yeah.

7281
09:59:03,850 --> 09:59:06,350
Aiden Ross fucking bot faceclad today.

7282
09:59:06,630 --> 09:59:08,790
So there's like a lot of memories left.

7283
09:59:09,590 --> 09:59:10,730
That's fucking funny.

7284
09:59:11,530 --> 09:59:12,230
I was like wondering.

7285
09:59:12,330 --> 09:59:13,070
I was like, wow.

7286
09:59:13,330 --> 09:59:15,890
Aren't they all like super successful?

7287
09:59:16,230 --> 09:59:16,590
Or something?

7288
09:59:16,730 --> 09:59:18,650
Like they're like literally millionaires right now.

7289
09:59:18,950 --> 09:59:19,510
How old?

7290
09:59:19,610 --> 09:59:21,650
They're like fucking so young too.

7291
09:59:21,670 --> 09:59:31,030
And they're like I think like I honestly think like getting
rich really young fucks with you so much Like you don't

7292
09:59:31,030 --> 09:59:32,930
you're not like mature enough for that shit.

7293
09:59:33,010 --> 09:59:35,610
I feel like because you don't grow as a person

7294
09:59:44,680 --> 09:59:50,180
Yeah, they're like 22 That's fucking crazy.

7295
09:59:50,340 --> 09:59:54,420
They're like 20 to 22 years old and they're literally
millionaires.

7296
09:59:54,740 --> 10:00:01,870
Yeah I think like You should start a podcast.

7297
10:00:02,070 --> 10:00:04,530
I'm so bad at podcasting.

7298
10:00:04,770 --> 10:00:06,210
I'd rather just be the guest.

7299
10:00:10,550 --> 10:00:12,650
FaceBank submits on Twitter to Viewbot.

7300
10:00:12,810 --> 10:00:15,650
Bro, you know why people Viewbot?

7301
10:00:17,530 --> 10:00:25,430
Like, this is, okay, other than being at the top of the
page, but like, by sponsors pay, I don't know if I talked

7302
10:00:25,430 --> 10:00:37,110
about this before, but sponsors pay per 100 CCV usually so
it's like it's usually like x amount of money per 100 ccv so

7303
10:00:37,110 --> 10:00:45,350
that's why people viewbot because they're like they only
look at ccb you know like okay i'm gonna i'm gonna it's not

7304
10:00:45,350 --> 10:00:54,250
really a leak but i helped some devs to not get scammed for
rivals i helped the rivals devs to not get scammed because

7305
10:00:54,250 --> 10:01:02,890
they were accidentally sponsoring viewbotters in the marvel
rivals category and i was I told them I was like bro that

7306
10:01:02,890 --> 10:01:08,670
person's a viewbotter like and they're like but they have so
many views and I'm like yeah but look at the chat

7307
10:01:08,670 --> 10:01:15,090
interactions it barely moves and like you can literally
check them out on Twitch tracker and see like they just

7308
10:01:15,090 --> 10:01:22,870
gained like a million followers within like a month and then
nothing like barely anything after that so like um and the

7309
10:01:22,870 --> 10:01:34,310
thing is they they this is like a regular thing sponsors
don't look past numbers uh they don't fucking look past

7310
10:01:34,310 --> 10:01:40,490
numbers they barely like they don't really like research uh
because it's like they sponsors go through bro usually go

7311
10:01:40,490 --> 10:01:46,450
through brokers so like brokers they don't want to do the
research on like who they're sponsoring so they're broke

7312
10:01:46,450 --> 10:01:51,210
they just go through brokers and just be like i want to get
these people and the brokers would just be like oh these

7313
10:01:51,210 --> 10:01:57,270
people have these views you want to get them and they're
like yeah okay we pay x amount of money per 100 ccv so

7314
10:01:57,270 --> 10:02:05,170
people a lot of streamers now they view bot so they can get
more they get bigger payouts and everything and i remember i

7315
10:02:05,170 --> 10:02:12,590
told you guys how like um a big stream they actually leaked
a big streamer rates to me so i fucking know how much people

7316
10:02:12,590 --> 10:02:21,570
get paid if they have like 40k plus like viewers if they
have 40 000 plus viewers i know exactly how much they get

7317
10:02:24,590 --> 10:02:25,630
It's crazy.

7318
10:02:25,790 --> 10:02:27,230
It's a fucking crazy amount.

7319
10:02:28,290 --> 10:02:31,450
Compared to what I get paid for, like, the CCV I have.

7320
10:02:32,090 --> 10:02:33,710
And that's why people view by it.

7321
10:02:33,710 --> 10:02:36,690
Because, like, they can, they can, like, scam the sponsors.

7322
10:02:37,430 --> 10:02:41,770
Like, so they can, like, paid.

7323
10:02:42,090 --> 10:02:44,250
It's, like, good investment for them.

7324
10:02:44,610 --> 10:02:52,810
Because they literally can get paid insane amounts of money
for, like, lying about their CCVs.

7325
10:02:54,750 --> 10:02:58,230
Yeah, it's like a little it's a little infinite money
glitch.

7326
10:02:58,630 --> 10:03:04,490
So that's why like because like face clan I won't be
surprised they get sponsored a lot and because they get

7327
10:03:04,490 --> 10:03:13,190
sponsored a lot They get paid a lot of fucking money for
like the amount for just because they have to match the CCV

7328
10:03:13,190 --> 10:03:21,090
They have to be like X amount like you date their their
policy is that X month X amount of money for X for a hundred

7329
10:03:21,770 --> 10:03:28,650
CCV um it's it's legal because like how you they don't
really know you're getting viewbotter now but yeah i helped

7330
10:03:28,650 --> 10:03:35,230
the marvel rivals devs figure out who was a viewbotter or
not because i was like you're wasting your money like like

7331
10:03:35,230 --> 10:03:41,570
you're wasting your money like that this like this person or
that person is clearly viewbotting like you're not getting

7332
10:03:41,570 --> 10:03:48,990
what your their monies were yeah it's really like a fraction
of the cost that's why that's why twitch was like so strict

7333
10:03:48,990 --> 10:03:55,130
about cutting numbers like how everyone was saying like i
can't believe Twitch, like, fucked up my numbers or some

7334
10:03:55,130 --> 10:03:59,150
shit like that, which is understandable because it's
literally your livelihood and everything.

7335
10:03:59,510 --> 10:04:05,950
But Twitch had to double it down because sponsors and
advertisement, like, advertisers were getting really fucking

7336
10:04:05,950 --> 10:04:08,590
mad about it because they felt like they were getting
scammed.

7337
10:04:11,840 --> 10:04:18,640
Because they're like, wait, I'm not getting my monies worth
advertising to these, to these, like, sponsoring these

7338
10:04:18,640 --> 10:04:24,940
streamers because it feels like their numbers are way often
what they actually are because a lot of them are viewbotting

7339
10:04:24,940 --> 10:04:33,540
and it's crazy the gap like even getting like if they are
like a big number of streamers um like they're like you know

7340
10:04:33,540 --> 10:04:45,940
even like they are like 20k ccv and if you bought 10k the
amount of money you get between 10k to to 20k is a huge gap

7341
10:04:45,940 --> 10:04:53,020
as someone that has seen how much like people get paid for
their sponsors A fucking huge gap between it.

7342
10:04:53,240 --> 10:04:56,780
Like you get, it's like actual like crazy amount of money.

7343
10:05:08,480 --> 10:05:11,080
Uh, fake view bots are like fake viewers, viewers.

7344
10:05:11,400 --> 10:05:16,700
So it's like, uh, yeah, you're using a software to like
inflate your numbers.

7345
10:05:16,880 --> 10:05:19,020
That's why Twitch has to go really hard on it.

7346
10:05:19,080 --> 10:05:21,900
Because like sponsors were getting really fucking mad about
it.

7347
10:05:21,940 --> 10:05:23,200
Because it's on Twitch too.

7348
10:05:23,540 --> 10:05:26,280
Because like, because sponsors were getting mad.

7349
10:05:26,560 --> 10:05:28,040
But all they could do is blame Twitch.

7350
10:05:28,180 --> 10:05:29,360
They can't really blame the streamers.

7351
10:05:29,380 --> 10:05:32,360
because they're like you let this happen on this platform

7352
10:05:47,960 --> 10:05:56,260
yeah and now the numbers are super deflated because they
went super fucking hard on it too that's why like uh that's

7353
10:05:56,260 --> 10:06:04,480
why people on kick kick also view like apparently like kick
has lesser moderation for viewbotting so like but that's why

7354
10:06:04,480 --> 10:06:10,200
you see like for kick streamers they like viewbot so hard
because it's just good payday

7355
10:06:19,440 --> 10:06:24,780
no viewbotting is everywhere It's not like, nobody is safe
from you, budding.

7356
10:06:32,770 --> 10:06:38,790
Bro, I recently found out that I didn't even realize this,
but the creator of Kik, Kik, because I was like, how the

7357
10:06:38,790 --> 10:06:41,490
fuck is he able to afford all these sponsors, you know?

7358
10:06:41,890 --> 10:06:49,870
Like, able to afford all these contracts with big-ass
streamers, but the creator of Kik literally created Stake,

7359
10:06:50,350 --> 10:06:52,090
the fucking gambling website.

7360
10:06:52,190 --> 10:06:54,930
You know, like, when you see the memes and stuff, it's like,
sponsored by Stake.

7361
10:06:57,350 --> 10:07:02,470
It's literally, they're It's literally sponsored by like the
online gambling website.

7362
10:07:03,490 --> 10:07:05,410
Yeah, I recently found that out.

7363
10:07:05,470 --> 10:07:10,130
Because I was like, how the fuck is he able to afford
contracts with all these like John ass streamers?

7364
10:07:11,730 --> 10:07:12,250
It's just used.

7365
10:07:12,370 --> 10:07:14,610
Yeah, it's literally just used to promote steak.

7366
10:07:20,940 --> 10:07:21,320
Yeah.

7367
10:07:23,400 --> 10:07:25,880
Why is Kick treated like Chicago streaming?

7368
10:07:26,780 --> 10:07:29,620
Because people can drive while streaming on Kick.

7369
10:07:33,960 --> 10:07:46,720
murder i mean they do get banned but like but like
surprisingly very fucked up but um a lot of a lot of like

7370
10:07:46,720 --> 10:07:55,760
dangerous things happen on like because like it's less
regulations like i said it's less regulations this is my

7371
10:07:55,760 --> 10:08:03,800
biggest peppy people who stream themselves driving and it's
very common on kick it's also it's also happens on twitch

7372
10:08:03,800 --> 10:08:10,560
and this is what i also really don't like about it um i
don't know i don't think i don't know if youtube also

7373
10:08:10,560 --> 10:08:14,920
regulates this because i don't see this happening on youtube
quite often or i don't haven't seen it happen at all on

7374
10:08:14,920 --> 10:08:27,120
youtube but um i don't like how people how moderation for
people driving while streaming is very loose and I've seen

7375
10:08:27,120 --> 10:08:33,400
it happen on Twitch and but I've seen it happen a lot on
kick like it's like the thing like the thing people just

7376
10:08:33,400 --> 10:08:40,820
stream themselves driving because there's no regulations for
it it's like literally texting while driving but worse I

7377
10:08:40,820 --> 10:08:48,840
think texting while driving is safer than streaming while
driving because you're literally reading chat you're fucking

7378
10:08:48,840 --> 10:08:56,060
reading chat while you're fucking driving you're not paying
attention to the road and that is so scary

7379
10:09:02,700 --> 10:09:11,140
yeah like yeah you're not texting while driving but you're
literally reading while driving like reading and trying to

7380
10:09:11,140 --> 10:09:19,100
entertain an audience while driving it's so much more
dangerous and yet it's not right like there it is not

7381
10:09:19,100 --> 10:09:28,160
regulated and that's what peeves me the most and there's so
many fucking car crashes because of streaming

7382
10:09:35,000 --> 10:09:35,440
Yeah.

7383
10:09:45,630 --> 10:09:47,470
Why do people watch someone drive anyway?

7384
10:09:47,650 --> 10:09:48,230
It's IRL.

7385
10:09:49,190 --> 10:09:54,290
It's because, like, it's not the it's not the driving,
watching someone while driving.

7386
10:09:54,590 --> 10:09:55,450
It's the interactions.

7387
10:09:55,650 --> 10:09:58,070
Like, where they're going, the interactions and everything.

7388
10:10:00,870 --> 10:10:02,830
It's a 4, it's IRL, basically.

7389
10:10:03,050 --> 10:10:06,390
Because IRL is just living vicariously off of the streamer.

7390
10:10:07,410 --> 10:10:08,230
More often.

7391
10:10:08,810 --> 10:10:13,350
Because, you know, they're doing all these cool things and
you're, like, you have to have a glimpse of, like, what that

7392
10:10:13,350 --> 10:10:19,870
life is like it's also why it's it's like it's like vlogging
it's like basically that's why vlogging channels were so

7393
10:10:19,870 --> 10:10:29,550
popular back then but rl streaming is literally like the
live version of vlogging um but it's like how oh my god i

7394
10:10:29,550 --> 10:10:34,430
hate family channels like you know like those like like
family channels where they exploit their kids and like that

7395
10:10:34,430 --> 10:10:40,790
is like it's similar to that like people live vicariously
through the family and being like oh like i wish my family

7396
10:10:40,790 --> 10:10:48,110
was like this and i so and and they do like these things but
I feel that uh I feel like it's I hate the exploitation of

7397
10:10:48,110 --> 10:10:56,270
children yeah those are so bad I recently was watching it it
popped up on my short but there was this like lady there was

7398
10:10:56,270 --> 10:11:05,570
this lady who was like whole thing is that she adopted she
has 12 kids and half of them are adopted um and like but

7399
10:11:05,570 --> 10:11:16,550
then like it felt weird it felt so weird because she took
them like barely and it was like snowing really hard and um

7400
10:11:16,550 --> 10:11:22,310
and like it's it looked really cold and then she was just
like they were just like all standing out there in the snow

7401
10:11:22,310 --> 10:11:31,150
waiting for their photos yeah and i was like that is so
fucking weird like i was like that fucking i was like bro

7402
10:11:31,150 --> 10:11:39,170
fucking why are you why are you making them all standing up
in the open and stuff and everything like It's so weird and

7403
10:11:39,170 --> 10:11:46,330
and I read about it apparently like she's it's like super
exploitative too because like She's just using them for

7404
10:11:46,330 --> 10:11:47,770
content and stuff

7405
10:11:52,230 --> 10:11:54,390
Just like Timmy and Yumi on Doki.

7406
10:11:54,490 --> 10:11:55,870
No, that's different guys

7407
10:11:58,950 --> 10:12:12,030
That's that's different guys They are not children Timmy and
Yumi are adults So it's not exploited.

7408
10:12:15,500 --> 10:12:15,860
Caught.

7409
10:12:20,000 --> 10:12:20,440
Don't.

7410
10:12:20,620 --> 10:12:21,460
That's it to me.

7411
10:12:21,860 --> 10:12:23,540
They're not here right now.

7412
10:12:23,820 --> 10:12:24,140
To me.

7413
10:12:25,800 --> 10:12:26,680
It's different.

7414
10:12:27,300 --> 10:12:27,620
Okay.

7415
10:12:29,680 --> 10:12:31,360
You're going to call the cops for yourself.

7416
10:12:31,500 --> 10:12:32,800
They won't believe you.

7417
10:12:37,900 --> 10:12:39,260
Juge, thank you for the super chat.

7418
10:12:39,320 --> 10:12:39,560
Thank you.

7419
10:12:39,600 --> 10:12:40,240
Thank you.

7420
10:12:40,340 --> 10:12:41,260
Good morning, Doki.

7421
10:12:41,400 --> 10:12:43,260
I'm stuck in isolation with flu right now.

7422
10:12:43,380 --> 10:12:44,100
So thank you to all.

7423
10:12:44,120 --> 10:12:46,060
to you and all the dragons are keeping me company.

7424
10:12:46,320 --> 10:12:47,220
Thank you for the super chat.

7425
10:12:47,580 --> 10:12:47,820
Thank you.

7426
10:12:48,300 --> 10:12:48,920
Thank you.

7427
10:12:55,940 --> 10:13:00,180
And be the Toki where children's situation is crazy.

7428
10:13:02,320 --> 10:13:02,960
But yeah, no.

7429
10:13:04,380 --> 10:13:05,020
I don't know.

7430
10:13:05,380 --> 10:13:08,100
I'm just not a fan of shit like that.

7431
10:13:08,440 --> 10:13:10,520
It's like oh my god.

7432
10:13:12,960 --> 10:13:17,720
And also people who like There's so many things that drives
my gears.

7433
10:13:21,340 --> 10:13:27,740
But, but yeah, like, I just think, like, I just think
driving while streaming should be outright, uh, forever,

7434
10:13:27,860 --> 10:13:28,180
Ben.

7435
10:13:29,200 --> 10:13:35,360
I wish, I feel like, I think it's because, like, politicians
don't know yet, you know, because they're not hip with the

7436
10:13:35,360 --> 10:13:38,660
kids, how fucking bad it is now.

7437
10:13:39,380 --> 10:13:41,320
Um, that's why there's no rules against it.

7438
10:13:41,340 --> 10:13:45,200
Because, like, you know, the moment texting and driving is,
is illegal.

7439
10:13:45,680 --> 10:13:49,040
Using your phone and everything is super illegal because
everyone knows about it.

7440
10:13:49,640 --> 10:13:54,380
I think we just gotta wait a couple more years until it's
actually bad, bad.

7441
10:13:56,960 --> 10:13:59,340
Also, like, I hate how everyone just rage baits now.

7442
10:14:00,720 --> 10:14:02,100
Okay, I'll tell you guys this.

7443
10:14:02,380 --> 10:14:03,680
There's a reason why I don't...

7444
10:14:05,060 --> 10:14:09,360
I know there's, like, people who, like, be like, what's your
opinion on this?

7445
10:14:09,420 --> 10:14:14,080
What's your opinion on this on, like, things that are super
controversial, especially in the content creation sphere?

7446
10:14:14,300 --> 10:14:15,660
I usually don't respond to it.

7447
10:14:15,680 --> 10:14:20,600
I know you should just ignore it because the thing is this
is what I hate about it too but like it's what it gets you

7448
10:14:20,600 --> 10:14:29,060
it's basically what gets you seen nowadays it's engagement
baiting it's engagement baiting and rage baiting and it's

7449
10:14:29,060 --> 10:14:35,660
like the meta now in the content creation not I mean not
really in the v-tubing sphere but more so in the general

7450
10:14:35,660 --> 10:14:45,940
content creation sphere you guys want to know why all these
like really big content creators are always being like to

7451
10:14:45,940 --> 10:14:52,020
everything or like or like reacting to stuff or being like
putting inserting themselves in something that they're not

7452
10:14:52,020 --> 10:14:58,540
really involved with but they want to give their opinion on
because that's engagement baiting and because of that um it

7453
10:14:58,540 --> 10:15:05,300
puts you them in the forefront because you talk about them
you talk about these streamers you talk about what they're

7454
10:15:05,300 --> 10:15:11,760
saying you talk you put them out you you make them relevant
again because and it works

7455
10:15:16,220 --> 10:15:24,160
loads that shit it literally yeah it literally makes them
money and they click farm and everything it's just what it's

7456
10:15:24,160 --> 10:15:30,540
just what works and like that's why like I don't I don't
normally like you know I see people asking my opinion and

7457
10:15:30,540 --> 10:15:40,280
stuff or asking like oh and I don't I don't play to it even
though I know if I did it would it will boost my numbers it

7458
10:15:40,280 --> 10:15:53,480
will like it will like get me people talk about me but I
personally don't think for me my mental health and also like

7459
10:15:53,480 --> 10:16:00,140
my I guess I guess I don't know I don't have integrity is
the right word I just don't feel comfortable with that shit

7460
10:16:00,140 --> 10:16:11,080
because like I just want I don't want to fucking do that
like I have made comments or like responded things but only

7461
10:16:11,080 --> 10:16:18,180
when it really has something to do with me if I'm like
personally you know obviously I would make a response or

7462
10:16:18,180 --> 10:16:26,220
like if it's something we're like or if it's something like
you know I felt very heavily relate to it then I will make a

7463
10:16:26,220 --> 10:16:32,140
response but if it's something where I know it's like clip
farming engagement baiting rage baiting shit like that like

7464
10:16:32,140 --> 10:16:39,760
I tend to not I tend to just ignore it uh but that's what a
lot of content creators do now everyone's just rage baiting

7465
10:16:39,760 --> 10:16:46,740
engagement baiting clip farming and everything because it
makes you It makes people talk about you and like it spreads

7466
10:16:46,740 --> 10:16:53,640
your name everywhere And then you don't forget about these
people because of it And it works, it makes them a lot of

7467
10:16:53,640 --> 10:17:00,800
money That's streaming meta now And it's, you know That's
why a lot of these content creators are also They haven't

7468
10:17:00,800 --> 10:17:05,680
fallen off, you know Because that's the scary thing about
content creation That's something I'm always afraid of

7469
10:17:05,680 --> 10:17:13,860
falling off That's why I'd like this next year Next year I'm
focusing more on rebuilding my brand building but you know

7470
10:17:13,860 --> 10:17:27,360
keeping expanding my brand um and uh expanding my brand and
like you know building myself up more and uh putting myself

7471
10:17:27,360 --> 10:17:37,540
out there more uh and uh and stuff like that but it does
work for those people but it's like everywhere it's like

7472
10:17:37,540 --> 10:17:41,980
it's like the new meta now and it's but like i said that's
what makes like these big content creators like the really

7473
10:17:41,980 --> 10:17:49,600
really big ones that's if it feels like you know they're too
big to fail type deal because they are they are because they

7474
10:17:49,600 --> 10:17:56,960
they know the meta which is like just continuing to put
themselves in the forefront and making people talk about

7475
10:17:56,960 --> 10:18:01,260
them because it like i said it fucking works

7476
10:18:16,170 --> 10:18:23,950
no i also agree like it also like creates a community that's
also like it's not a community that i want to foster

7477
10:18:48,820 --> 10:18:50,880
Once you become too toxic, nobody wants...

7478
10:18:50,880 --> 10:18:52,020
That is not true.

7479
10:18:52,340 --> 10:18:55,380
In the content creation circle, unfortunately.

7480
10:18:56,020 --> 10:19:00,620
I know it's like, oh, the real world, like, you don't want
to associate...

7481
10:19:01,360 --> 10:19:01,960
That...

7482
10:19:01,960 --> 10:19:07,740
In the content creation circle, that's not really that true.

7483
10:19:08,560 --> 10:19:12,760
As long as you have the numbers, someone will hang out with
you.

7484
10:19:20,280 --> 10:19:23,640
It's like It's literally that

7485
10:19:27,020 --> 10:19:38,960
It's sad but true Yeah Oh my I haven't heard anything about

He knows four fucking languages at least.

7498
10:21:23,090 --> 10:21:24,750
Because his wife is Italian.

journey to the end like from beginning to end and he yeah

7508
10:22:47,060 --> 10:22:53,620
yeah like no one's perfect in content creation like if you
are then you're literally a fucking you're literally a

7509
10:22:53,620 --> 10:22:59,580
fucking test tube baby grown by the government and this was
your goal if you are actually a perfect content creator

7510
10:22:59,580 --> 10:23:16,420
because we're all human we all make mistakes um yeah um yeah
and like but like at the end at the end he got to like like

10:23:16,420 --> 10:23:25,300
do everything like you know he gets to be semi retired and
just live his life right after and he's only like what like

7518
10:24:39,120 --> 10:24:47,740
something I want to do in 2027 um and it's that like also
like recently I read a quote being like you should

7519
10:24:47,740 --> 10:24:53,820
experience the world more and travel more when you're young
versus doing that working all the way till you're like much

7520
10:24:53,820 --> 10:24:58,940
older and not being able to experience that type of
experiences that you could experience when you're younger

7521
10:24:58,940 --> 10:25:07,160
and like that like really really hard for me because i've
been like grinding a lot like the last couple of years i've

7522
10:25:07,160 --> 10:25:12,980
always been like very sheltered so i didn't get to like i
did get to travel with my parents when i was like really

7523
10:25:12,980 --> 10:25:19,040

2027 relax a bit more and like do traveling stuff.

10:27:06,990 --> 10:27:11,090
That was so sad because they didn't really do anything with
it and, like, ruined the game, too.

7545
10:27:11,770 --> 10:27:13,670
Because the early access was so good.

7546
10:27:18,830 --> 10:27:21,730
It was, like, it was like a Minecraft RPG thing.

7547
10:27:22,390 --> 10:27:23,030
But, like, Indy.

7548
10:27:23,810 --> 10:27:24,790

It was so good in beta.

7574
10:28:52,690 --> 10:28:55,510
And then they fucking changed everything.

7575
10:28:55,870 --> 10:28:58,010
For no fucking reason.

7576
10:28:58,990 --> 10:28:59,570
Like...

7577
10:29:01,350 --> 10:29:01,930
Bro.

7578
10:29:02,470 --> 10:29:03,730
Like the beta was so...

7579
10:29:03,730 --> 10:29:06,930
And then they're like, they're like, Wow, everyone seems to
love the beta.

7580
10:29:07,330 --> 10:29:08,030
You know what?

7581
10:29:08,090 --> 10:29:08,790
Let's change.

7582
10:29:08,810 --> 10:29:17,710
everything about the fucking game yeah no

7583
10:29:21,860 --> 10:29:31,320
that like yeah I'm no longer epi I'm no longer epi that that
shit made me like remembering that made me so fucking angry

7584
10:29:31,320 --> 10:29:38,020
literally the very first game I've ever kickstarted the very
first thing I ever kickstarted

7585
10:29:41,310 --> 10:29:57,990
that's crazy it that's fucking crazy I was so fucking
disappointed it gave me a second win it almost did guys but

7586
10:29:57,990 --> 10:30:00,170
i'm trying to be realistic here

7587
10:30:05,560 --> 10:30:14,400
no it wasn't a cash grab it was literally like it was like
procedural gender it was literally procedural generated so

7588
10:30:14,400 --> 10:30:18,680
like everything like everyone's um instance in cube world
was unique

7589
10:30:22,360 --> 10:30:24,880
And like, it was very fun.

7590
10:30:24,980 --> 10:30:26,700
Like, you could play with your friends and everything.

7591
10:30:26,860 --> 10:30:29,080
There was multiplayer, and you could play with your friends.

7592
10:30:29,220 --> 10:30:34,420
And like, because Acupra was like a really, really, it was
like an old game and everything.

7593
10:30:34,660 --> 10:30:38,120
And like, but still, the multiplayer was actually really
good.

7594
10:30:39,140 --> 10:30:40,640
No, I've not played Warframe.

7595
10:30:40,860 --> 10:30:43,880
I know a lot of people have been talking about Warframe
lately because it's been happening.

7596
10:30:43,880 --> 10:30:45,280
It's getting a resurgence lately.

7597
10:30:46,100 --> 10:30:47,780
I did play, I remember playing Destiny.

7598
10:30:47,880 --> 10:30:49,260
I did enjoy Destiny for a bit.

7599
10:30:49,260 --> 10:30:57,340
I only stopped playing because it got way too Like I I
played for a bit But it just felt way too granny because I

7600
10:30:57,340 --> 10:31:05,200
literally Couldn't do PvP because I had the shittiest
Fucking guns so it just like wasn't fun For me Um in the end

7601
10:31:06,760 --> 10:31:13,180
And I know Like Warframe is getting like a sudden resurgence
Again why is Warframe getting A resurgence lately

7602
10:31:25,160 --> 10:31:26,440
Huge new update

7603
10:31:38,600 --> 10:31:40,460
Oh Oh, new content.

7604
10:31:45,280 --> 10:31:48,540
Oh, oh, because they went hard on sponsoring people.

7605
10:31:48,720 --> 10:31:50,820
I mean, yeah, it's always Rick's, yeah.

7606
10:31:52,500 --> 10:31:54,360
New update has pretty women.

7607
10:32:01,580 --> 10:32:04,660
Yeah, because, like, because Warframe's been around.

7608
10:32:04,860 --> 10:32:05,180
I don't know.

7609
10:32:05,240 --> 10:32:07,800
I don't know which one's been around longer, Destiny or
Warframe.

7610
10:32:08,200 --> 10:32:10,200
But Warframe's been around for a while now.

7611
10:32:10,260 --> 10:32:15,580
So I was, like, so curious why, like, everyone's talking,
like, everybody's talking about it again.

7612
10:32:15,760 --> 10:32:19,640
Like, I saw a lot of VTubers are fucking streaming it now.

7613
10:32:23,750 --> 10:32:25,550
So I was like, what's going on?

7614
10:32:25,670 --> 10:32:26,150
Yeah.

7615
10:32:27,770 --> 10:32:30,650
Because it's always been, like, Warframe versus Destiny.

7616
10:32:31,230 --> 10:32:32,930
But, like, Destiny is falling off now.

7617
10:32:33,090 --> 10:32:33,890
And then Warframe's coming.

7618
10:32:33,930 --> 10:32:39,330
Because, like, Destiny would be the one that's being, like,
being talked by everyone.

7619
10:32:40,090 --> 10:32:43,970
In terms of, also, like, I know, like, Twitch does a lot of
things with Destiny as well.

7620
10:32:44,990 --> 10:32:47,970
When it comes to, like, Twitch rivals and sponsors and
stuff.

7621
10:32:47,990 --> 10:32:56,310
stuff and it's up this year warframe just suddenly like it's
like everyone's talking about warframe now i was so confused

7622
10:32:56,310 --> 10:33:02,570
because i was like they both it's always been like you know
like the console wars you know like it's like destiny versus

7623
10:33:02,570 --> 10:33:09,830
warframe and stuff like that so that's why i was like oh how
did warframe came back

7624
10:33:13,790 --> 10:33:21,310
oh man they give a super chat thank you thank you Warframe
is Much better than Destiny I see that someone almost 4k

7625
10:33:21,310 --> 10:33:30,290
hours in Destiny 2 I also remember dancing When you did 10
When you did 10 Yeah cause you're fucking Grinding guns

7626
10:33:35,690 --> 10:33:46,030
I remember doing very well In the PvP modes Even with the
shitty guns I had Cause I had that aim I

7627
10:33:50,460 --> 10:33:56,100
the more framed devs constantly deliver regarding updates
box they use super chat thank you thank you that makes sense

7628
10:33:56,100 --> 10:34:03,220
i mean as long as the oh wait as long as the um the devs
treat their community well you know it always go be what go

7629
10:34:03,220 --> 10:34:14,340
well also that reminded me of that the game awards i forgot
which dev was it was it bouldersgate oh yeah they won the

7630
10:34:14,340 --> 10:34:24,380
award for like most best supportive some shit and then
literally a couple of days later the entire community turned

7631
10:34:24,380 --> 10:34:31,660
against boulderscape because they admitted they used ai or
something was it that i thought that was really funny

7632
10:34:31,660 --> 10:34:43,480
because they literally just won like you know best
supportive community yeah yeah and then they're like fucking

7633
10:34:43,480 --> 10:34:55,700
hate you like the guy feels like i fucking hate you
boulderscape fuck you I was like, what the fuck?

7634
10:34:57,300 --> 10:35:00,140
Like right after they won, too.

7635
10:35:01,180 --> 10:35:01,400
Yeah,

7636
10:35:09,970 --> 10:35:20,050
they used AI as a foundation, but it, it's, you know, AI is
such a controversial topic to talk about sometimes.

7637
10:35:22,750 --> 10:35:32,350
understand and it it does suck because it does take away
jobs from like real people but I feel like it's unavoidable

7638
10:35:32,350 --> 10:35:45,710
now like I know a lot of people are fighting about it and
everything but capitalism will always win I know it's like

7639
10:35:45,710 --> 10:35:56,350
it's companies will always go for the cheapest route wrong

7640
10:35:59,920 --> 10:36:17,710
i feel like companies will will always go for whatever
whatever is the cheapest route when it comes to like when it

7641
10:36:17,710 --> 10:36:24,750
comes to like what can we do cheaper it fucking sucks it
really does I think, like, I...

7642
10:36:25,710 --> 10:36:26,410
I love...

7643
10:36:26,410 --> 10:36:27,450
Okay, here's one of something.

7644
10:36:27,850 --> 10:36:29,330
I love Professor Layden.

7645
10:36:30,990 --> 10:36:32,150
It is...

7646
10:36:32,150 --> 10:36:33,050
One of my favorite...

7647
10:36:33,050 --> 10:36:34,290
It is literally my...

7648
10:36:34,290 --> 10:36:36,250
I would rank it as number one.

7649
10:36:37,730 --> 10:36:38,310
Um...

7650
10:36:38,310 --> 10:36:41,150
Number one of my favorite game ever.

7651
10:36:41,390 --> 10:36:43,370
Because it gave me so much love and passion.

7652
10:36:43,630 --> 10:36:45,710
Over the characters, the stories, and everything.

7653
10:36:46,190 --> 10:36:49,470
Level 5 now uses AI for almost every game they develop.

7654
10:36:50,230 --> 10:36:50,950
And they really...

7655
10:36:50,950 --> 10:36:52,310
They released, like...

7656
10:36:52,750 --> 10:37:02,850
They released like a little a document About like everything
they do with AI And like they even show like here's Here's

7657
10:37:02,850 --> 10:37:08,650
like they literally use it for like concept art and
everything To like conceptualize everything and then get

7658
10:37:08,650 --> 10:37:17,730
real artists to draw the concept art out But like yeah it's
crazy it's like I'll show you guys the tweet I was like oh

7659
10:37:17,730 --> 10:37:27,150
my god I was like I'm just like of them are really funny
though the concept art like it was pretty funny but still

7660
10:37:27,150 --> 10:37:34,990
i'm just like oh my god but they're very open about it too
they're very fucking open about using it

7661
10:37:47,880 --> 10:37:53,900
here but yeah i would always be like a super controversial
topic to talk about

7662
10:37:59,170 --> 10:38:09,110
i just think i my opinion is that i think it's obviously
like it's that it takes away like you know jobs from real

7663
10:38:09,110 --> 10:38:21,260
human beings and stuff it's like how like people always be
like to like uh what is it called to like what does jobs

7664
10:38:21,260 --> 10:38:29,480
call like working in retail and everything retail and fast
food they'll be like robots will replace you ai's will

7665
10:38:29,480 --> 10:38:42,410
replace you and shit like that you know that's obviously
that fucking sucks you know yeah it just the only thing i

7666
10:38:42,410 --> 10:38:52,150
like about ai is when ai was first started and people would
just make funny out of it like like the ash baby ash baby i

7667
10:38:52,150 --> 10:38:59,810
talked to her before the only thing i was that i that i used
to i i mean i won't say used i guess used to because now

7668
10:38:59,810 --> 10:39:08,150
it's just too much but like like maybe was fucking hilarious
and also the fact that parents are using AI to trick their

7669
10:39:08,150 --> 10:39:15,990
kids that Santa is real like I I'm sorry I just don't feel
like that's fucked okay but for me that's fucking hilarious

7670
10:39:15,990 --> 10:39:25,530
because I would do that if I had if I have a kid I would use
AI to make Santa like I would be like kids oh my god Santa

7671
10:39:25,530 --> 10:39:35,910
was just like in our house like and then I fucking AI
generated Santa a christmas tree and be like oh my god kids

7672
10:39:35,910 --> 10:39:39,510
and then they will believe that's so funny

7673
10:39:52,040 --> 10:39:53,120
you're evil

7674
10:39:58,320 --> 10:40:03,780
okay you know what okay and people okay it's really fun when
people make like ai videos that are like super like seem

7675
10:40:03,780 --> 10:40:11,360
really realistic but when people made that fucking ai video
of a cat holding a gun and going pop pop like a machine gun

7676
10:40:11,360 --> 10:40:24,340
i'm sorry that actually got me i like i wish people use ai
to make stupid like that like because like that's good

7677
10:40:24,340 --> 10:40:33,320
that's actually funny but like people don't do that people
like use ai to do like dumbass like fucking i hate like the

7678
10:40:33,320 --> 10:40:39,060
other The one with the artillery gun.

7679
10:40:39,280 --> 10:40:42,680
Like, she was like, there's a cow with a gun on the
doorstep.

7680
10:40:42,920 --> 10:40:48,380
And then, like, the cat started fucking shooting rounds on a
cat.

7681
10:40:48,560 --> 10:40:50,800
And I was like, okay, that's actually pretty funny.

7682
10:40:52,140 --> 10:40:53,920
Like, it was just stupid fucking memes.

7683
10:40:54,260 --> 10:40:54,820
That's fine.

7684
10:40:56,280 --> 10:40:56,760
Like...

7685
10:41:15,370 --> 10:41:17,610
I didn't know there'd be more regulations in the future.

7686
10:41:17,690 --> 10:41:19,030
It's because AI is still new.

7687
10:41:19,690 --> 10:41:20,310
That's why.

7688
10:41:21,730 --> 10:41:24,150
AI is still new and everything.

7689
10:41:24,490 --> 10:41:24,630
But...

7690
10:41:24,650 --> 10:41:29,570
It'll get regulated later because other like everything gets
regulated in the end

7691
10:41:42,900 --> 10:41:45,000
Uh, my name thank you for the super chat.

7692
10:41:45,240 --> 10:41:45,340
Thank you.

7693
10:41:45,680 --> 10:41:52,020
Thank you Call it now when the ai bubble pops the free
market capitalist will cry to government to force taxpayers

7694
10:41:52,020 --> 10:41:54,080
to cover their losses Thank you the super chat.

7695
10:41:54,120 --> 10:41:55,020
Thank you.

7696
10:41:55,020 --> 10:42:02,760
Thank you There's something that I'm gonna say something I
want to talk about but I remember

7697
10:42:20,700 --> 10:42:27,940
I'm trying to remember right now I'm using like There's not
much of my brain left But I'm trying my best to use like At

7698
10:42:27,940 --> 10:42:40,920
least like 1% of it I'm trying There's something I want to
talk about I'm trying to remember It's not going so well

7699
10:42:40,920 --> 10:43:00,100
though Memes songs There are some Some songs I didn't
realize were AI generated.

7700
10:43:00,280 --> 10:43:01,660
That shit is scary though.

7701
10:43:02,040 --> 10:43:05,380
They were like some fucking funny songs.

7702
10:43:06,100 --> 10:43:06,620
What was it?

7703
10:43:06,640 --> 10:43:12,260
It was like something, it was like a country related song
that was like really popular in like during the YouTube

7704
10:43:12,260 --> 10:43:13,640
shorts slash TikToks.

7705
10:43:14,020 --> 10:43:17,480
And then like I recently found out it was actually like AI
generated.

7706
10:43:17,620 --> 10:43:18,180
I was like, what?

7707
10:43:18,380 --> 10:43:19,820
Oh, it was so funny too.

7708
10:43:20,380 --> 10:43:22,040
I'm trying to remember what song it was.

7709
10:43:22,140 --> 10:43:24,040
It was like some country related song.

7710
10:43:26,540 --> 10:43:29,880
that was like that kept popping up on my youtube shorts for
a while

7711
10:43:33,460 --> 10:43:38,540
but it's like very scary because they can like replicate
like that's what i'm saying ai is getting more and more

7712
10:43:38,540 --> 10:43:45,060
regulated because like music artists were like bro that's
not cool but yes people were like um same with like sora ai

7713
10:43:45,060 --> 10:43:54,960
sora where like a lot of some companies started um uh
started sending like cease and desist letters for sora ai

7714
10:43:54,960 --> 10:44:07,740
because they're using their stuff and also uh and also for
like uh for like music artists when it came to like ai music

7715
10:44:07,740 --> 10:44:14,160
yeah because they're like they're that's my voice you can't
do that

7716
10:44:22,980 --> 10:44:29,820
bro you know what i hate the most they've like corrupted my
youtube shorts they'll ai generate reddit stories like fake

7717
10:44:29,820 --> 10:44:41,280
reddit stories and then put put it over like ai generate
like those like ADHD like videos and sub where they're like

7718
10:44:41,280 --> 10:44:48,840
you know like oh this like this oh my gosh those are and
like the AI post the Reddit post would be like like read oh

7719
10:44:48,840 --> 10:44:58,960
the alien AI reading over an AI generated Reddit fake Reddit
post and then putting that over an AI generated video of

7720
10:44:58,960 --> 10:45:12,440
like a like like random fucking videos like it's so fucking
weird like it like i i already fixed my youtube algorithm

7721
10:45:12,440 --> 10:45:19,880
for my shorts but it kept popping up for a while but like i
have to like force force feed my youtube algorithm like

7722
10:45:19,880 --> 10:45:30,960
non-slop to fix it oh my god speaking of ai also like i i
sort of want to do a parody of it has anyone got like on

7723
10:45:30,960 --> 10:45:39,620
youtube like when they're scrolling through youtube shorts
um there would be like these like gaming live streams where

7724
10:45:39,620 --> 10:45:46,680
it's like if you super chat me i'll wake up and it's
literally an in ai generated clip of this girl sleeping on

7725
10:45:46,680 --> 10:45:53,500
her chair like this like it's like this gaming room and it's
like an ai generated clip loop clip of this girl sleeping on

7726
10:45:53,500 --> 10:46:00,100
her chair and every time she wakes up she'll be like oh um
thank you for the super chat but i'm not gonna wake up yet

7728
10:46:13,160 --> 10:46:28,750

yeah and then I would see like how many people are watching

7729
10:46:28,750 --> 10:46:41,910
this and it'd be like 400 to 700 viewers and like what the
it's like they're money and subscribers off of people too

were trying to get subscribers.

7737
10:47:30,680 --> 10:47:35,040
They're trying to like, fucking be like, oh, um, don't, uh,

7751
10:49:02,690 --> 10:49:06,170
The thing is, like, there's so many of them.

7752
10:49:06,350 --> 10:49:09,230
It's not even from, like, one person.

7753
10:49:10,570 --> 10:49:18,590
users like creators that do it too and like i would always
like i'd like like it won't happen often but like i would

7754
10:49:18,590 --> 10:49:28,570
just be scrolling youtube shorts and it'll just pop up yeah
you might find in your algorithm if you scroll enough uh

10:49:40,570 --> 10:49:43,190
like the Miles Morales NPC shit.

7757
10:49:43,490 --> 10:49:44,550
They were real people.

7758
10:49:44,730 --> 10:49:46,230
It's not even real people.

7759
10:49:46,430 --> 10:49:47,270
It's all AI.

7760
10:49:51,170 --> 10:49:51,570
Oh, yeah.

7761
10:49:51,750 --> 10:49:52,910
Did you guys see the...

7762
10:49:52,910 --> 10:49:54,210
Oh, so that just reminded me.

7763
10:49:54,670 --> 10:49:55,870
Also, a lot of thank you was super chat.

7764
10:49:55,890 --> 10:49:56,630
Thank you.

7765
10:49:57,130 --> 10:50:05,610
That just reminded me that there was this, like, kid that
was like, stop saying 6-7.

7766
10:50:05,830 --> 10:50:06,990
It's not funny.

7767
10:50:07,270 --> 10:50:07,910
Stop it.

7768
10:50:07,970 --> 10:50:08,790
And it was like this kid.

7769
10:50:09,070 --> 10:50:13,890
And he was getting popular because people thought it was
like pretty fun like i didn't watch it i didn't really find

7770
10:50:13,890 --> 10:50:21,050
the humor in it but i guess it's like ironic humor um and
then he was like re he was like now i react i'm gonna react

7771
10:50:21,050 --> 10:50:26,990
to my most famous video now he literally like uploaded a
video be like i'm gonna react to my most famous video and

7772
10:50:26,990 --> 10:50:33,730
then like i think like a couple of days ago he fucking
uploaded another video like i think it was like a day

7773
10:50:33,730 --> 10:50:45,410
yesterday or a day before and he was like guys my my stop
saying video is now minted as an NFT.

7774
10:50:49,250 --> 10:50:52,390
And then he turned off comments.

7775
10:50:53,830 --> 10:50:56,690
Yeah, he's like this child, by the way.

7776
10:50:56,830 --> 10:50:58,510
I'm pretty sure he's like eight or something.

7777
10:50:59,070 --> 10:51:01,850
And he's like, you even like, he's like eight years old.

7778
10:51:02,010 --> 10:51:06,990
And he's like, and he's like doing like some Fortnite that's
like, guys, my, it's now minted now.

7779
10:51:07,030 --> 10:51:08,910
You could now get it as an NFT.

7780
10:51:09,190 --> 10:51:10,530
And I'm like, what the?

7781
10:51:10,550 --> 10:51:23,990
Fuck I'd probably kill this career before it could actually
happen Yeah It always goes back to NFTs somehow And then the

7782
10:51:23,990 --> 10:51:32,350
The thing is He fucking He's like six or seven years The
thing is He's He like turned off the comments on that video

7783
10:51:32,350 --> 10:51:39,750
too Like he knew what the fuck was gonna happen He had sold
out before Yeah he fucking or sold out

7784
10:51:45,340 --> 10:51:47,560
And that was fucking crazy.

7785
10:51:48,060 --> 10:51:49,440
Oh my god, it wasn't even an NFT.

7786
10:51:49,760 --> 10:51:51,320
He literally made a fucking cryptocurrency.

7787
10:51:51,700 --> 10:51:52,020
I forgot.

7788
10:51:52,200 --> 10:51:53,420
It wasn't even an NFT.

7789
10:51:53,880 --> 10:51:55,360
He made the fucking meme coin.

7790
10:51:55,980 --> 10:51:57,240
It wasn't an NFT, guys.

7791
10:51:57,380 --> 10:52:00,700
It was a fucking, he fucking, he did the Hawk Tour shit.

7792
10:52:01,040 --> 10:52:04,560
Where he fucking made the meme of Bitcoin, like
cryptocurrency.

7793
10:52:06,740 --> 10:52:08,680
And then, oh wait, this is my favorite part too.

7794
10:52:08,860 --> 10:52:10,440

I thought the description was fucking hilarious.

7803
10:52:23,240 --> 10:52:26,360

going on.

And I was like, kid, no Roblox kid is going to fucking
invest in your cryptocurrency.

7812
10:52:58,140 --> 10:53:00,880
I do not think these children know what it is.

7813
10:53:01,080 --> 10:53:05,740
I do not think these Roblox children know what a
cryptocurrency is, child.

7814
10:53:06,080 --> 10:53:14,560
I, he's like, he's like shilling into his Roblox community.

7818
10:53:40,580 --> 10:53:46,660
yeah crypto is definitely oh yeah bro did you guys see the
okay speaking of like pump and dump scheme did you see the

7819
10:53:46,660 --> 10:53:53,460
newest logan paul pump and dump scheme i don't know
understand how it's like you fell for it again i know it's

7820
10:53:53,460 --> 10:54:02,520
not How people keep falling for it again is actually like at
that point is is actually like impressive that it keeps

7821
10:54:02,520 --> 10:54:09,180
happening So and then I'll give you guys an update for those
who aren't terminally online Um, like I said, I'm terminally

7822
10:54:09,180 --> 10:54:15,900
online, but like it I am the power to my algorithm So like
some things I don't know because it's not on my algorithm So

7823
10:54:15,900 --> 10:54:29,680
I'm terminally online and a lot of other stuff so My fate is
controlled by my algorithm but the newest the newest like

7824
10:54:29,680 --> 10:54:38,260
pump and dump scheme that he did is that he went to like I
don't know what channel it is but it's like a famous

7825
10:54:38,260 --> 10:54:46,720
investing channel like actual like news channel for
investing he was like telling people like yeah Pokemon cards

7826
10:54:46,720 --> 10:54:52,680
are the next best investment in anything it's better than
stock market like ever since I started investing in Pokemon

7827
10:54:52,680 --> 10:54:59,700
cards like it has like double triple and whatever earn in
stock market like is what you have to do and then because

7828
10:54:59,700 --> 10:55:09,160
and he was like i am going to sell the most expect my most
surprised uh pokemon card um like a psa 10 like card and uh

7829
10:55:09,160 --> 10:55:14,580
yeah he did like a tv interview about with like the stock
like this like investment channel yeah and he's like it's

7830
10:55:14,580 --> 10:55:20,800
like 5.3 million pikachu card and it's like the most one
most expensive cards out there like literally like he got a

7831
10:55:20,800 --> 10:55:27,940
world record for buying the most fucking expensive card out
there he's like um and he's like um it's gonna go on auction

7832
10:55:27,940 --> 10:55:46,520
and and then he was like but and then the thing is um the
Pikachu card was on his website for the auction and in order

7833
10:55:46,520 --> 10:55:57,700
to be eligible to bid on the card you have to exchange your
real money for this fucking random made up money on his

7834
10:55:57,700 --> 10:56:12,580
website and apparently uh to the pump and dump is that when
people exchange their real money for this imaginary money on

7835
10:56:12,580 --> 10:56:22,020
this auction site they were not getting the their imaginary
money even though the payment went through and then to make

7836
10:56:22,020 --> 10:56:28,400
a tween be like yeah we had some issues like i'm talking to
the i'm talking right now to the organizers of the auction i

7837
10:56:28,400 --> 10:56:34,400
was not aware that this was going to happen or like it's
going to be this like poorly organized and then he got

7838
10:56:34,400 --> 10:56:40,900
community noted and was like logan paul is one of the
co-founders of this website

7839
10:56:46,580 --> 10:56:55,820
i like he loves like the community he's like he is one of
the co-founders of this website what the fuck do you mean he

7840
10:56:55,820 --> 10:57:13,020
didn't know what was going on like yeah because he literally
and then you click on the community note of where of where

Vox thank you for the super chat thank you thank you won't
don't you wake up

7845
10:57:44,880 --> 10:57:51,880
yeah community note has been a great addition to twitter
despite everything else all the other shit is not great but

7846
10:57:51,880 --> 10:57:56,640
bro my twitter has been like fucking up in terms of like i
don't know if anyone's been like searching stuff on twitter

7847
10:57:56,640 --> 10:58:02,860
but sometimes they pull up i don't know if like i think
there's something around the servers but they'll pull up

7848
10:58:02,860 --> 10:58:09,080
like old stuff even though I'm going by recent even when I'm
scrolling down it'll pull like super old shit and that's

7849
10:58:09,080 --> 10:58:10,400
when like I'm searching stuff on Twitter.

7850
10:58:10,660 --> 10:58:16,200
I don't know if it's just me but I feel like it's I feel
like I don't know if it's happening to everyone else also I

7851
10:58:16,200 --> 10:58:18,780
like how someone's like both Jake and Logan are so dumb.

7852
10:58:19,080 --> 10:58:25,000
Bro Jake there's a reason why Jake is very dumb right now
bro this guy is doing boxing

7853
10:58:28,560 --> 10:58:38,600
I'm I think he's lost like 70% of his brain cells like and
like a 30% already lost like 30% of that like from the last

7854
10:58:38,600 --> 10:58:54,750
match He didn't have a lot starting to be fair, but like
it's definitely gotten worse Yeah, I know so I was like

7855
10:58:54,750 --> 10:59:02,310
yeah, but he was dumb before yeah, but like now he's like
actually like Medically he people are surprised that he's

7856
10:59:02,310 --> 10:59:08,170
still going Like, I feel like medical professionals right
now are like, how is this guy still going right now?

7857
10:59:08,510 --> 10:59:13,190
Like, Megley speaking, there is concerns.

7858
10:59:29,290 --> 10:59:33,090
You are the lab, but not actually living.

7859
