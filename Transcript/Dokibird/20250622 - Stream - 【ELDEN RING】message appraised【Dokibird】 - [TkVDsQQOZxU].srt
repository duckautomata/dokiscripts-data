1
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:02,260
Woo!

2
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,920
Hello, everybody!

3
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,060
Hello, hello!

4
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,340
I'm sorry I'm a little late there.

5
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:58,540
Um, uh, for this to announce, the reason why I pushed back to stream three minutes later was that I have to take a little nap time.

6
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:10,080
And then when I woke up from nap time, um, Dad was on top of my legs and he was just, like, um, he was, like, sleeping and chilling on my legs.

7
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,000
You know, I, like, that was so weird because, like, you know, when I took my nap, I did put the stairs... I was weak.

8
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:16,960
I was very weak.

9
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:25,400
And I put the stairs back, uh, on my bed today, um, because this fucker was a demanding little bitch.

10
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:41,080
I don't know why, but, like, lately, he's been, like, okay, uh, it was really awkward because, uh, during the meet-and-greet, for some reason, um, he interrupted one guy during the meet-and-greet at Elfkai.

11
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,840
So I was doing my meet-and-greet at Elfkai.

12
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:49,360
And then while I was, like, talking to this guy, like, he came over and was like, stop talking to him!

13
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:58,440
Okay, I don't know if he was, like, telling me to stop talking to him, or he was telling me that he wants to talk to him.

14
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,980
So, um, he just started barking nonstop, he's like...

15
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,860
And I'm like, I'm sorry, he-he just wants to say hi.

16
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,520
But, like, it was just that one guy, too.

17
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,620
And then after we were done, he left, he walked away!

18
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,160
Um,

19
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,620
so, I have-I have no idea why he was, like, particularly demanding for that one guy.

20
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:31,260
Um, but anyway, so, but then, like, after I was done with the meet-and-greet, he was still barking.

21
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,780
But it was, like, 2pm.

22
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:39,380
And, like, I think he's been trying to, like, eat earlier and earlier.

23
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,440
And, like, I think it's the wet food.

24
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,180
I'm pretty sure.

25
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:49,940
I think, like, the wet food has made him more feral for food in general.

26
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,360
Because it's just so good.

27
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,460
Like, he just loves it so much.

28
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,340
And he just wants to eat it all the time.

29
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:04,000
And so, like, he's been trying to, like, trick me into, like, feeding him super early.

30
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,320
And, like, he's never had this issue before.

31
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,420
And, like, when I was feeding him dry food, he's never, like, been this demanding for food.

32
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,780
Like, he's addicted, I think.

33
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,440
I think he actually has a problem.

34
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:24,770
So, dry food, he's just like, oh, well, this food, I guess.

35
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,290
Like, oh, I'm so hungry, I'll eat anything.

36
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:32,890
And now that, I mean, now he's still being like, oh, I'm so hungry, I'll still eat anything.

37
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:38,310
But then, like, for wet food, it's like, I particularly want to eat this food.

38
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:47,310
So, yeah, so I was really weak because he actually woke me up while I was taking a nap.

39
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,790
He woke me up at, like, 4 p.m.

40
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,810
to be like, I want food now!

41
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:57,410
And now it's like, oh, my God, it's 4 p.m.

42
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,530
It's, oh, it's 4 p.m.

43
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:03,090
I can, oh, fuck, I'll feed you an hour early.

44
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,210
I'm so tired, I'll...

45
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:12,390
And so, you know, I fed him an hour, like, not an hour, so I fed him 30 minutes early.

46
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:22,530
And then he, like, looked at me and he, like, started, like, you know, getting on his high legs on the bed and being like, I want to be on the bed now.

47
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:27,410
Like, you know, like, you know, when the wiener dogs just be long.

48
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:32,590
They're trying to be long and they put the two front paws on top of a high area.

49
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:36,550
And he's like, I want to be on the bed, too.

50
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:43,030
And then, so I was just like, you know what?

51
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:47,730
Just for today, I really, really...

52
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:52,270
Mommy needs nap time really, really badly.

53
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:58,150
I really need nap time right now.

54
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,290
So I'm gonna let you up on the bed.

55
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,510
So I pushed the stairs.

56
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,210
I pushed the stairs to the bed.

57
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:08,770
And then, like, he didn't, he didn't get up in the bed, by the way.

58
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:09,890
But I didn't care at that point.

59
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,510
Like, he saw me put the stairs back.

60
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,130
He saw me move the stairs back on the bed.

61
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,390
And then he walked away.

62
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,510
And I was like, oh my God, you fucking ass.

63
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,290
He's like, why did you tell me?

64
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,290
He's like, well, not...

65
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,290
He's like, never mind.

66
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,170
Not anymore.

67
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:25,310
I don't...

68
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:27,970
He's like, you know what?

69
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,090
I don't want to be on the bed anymore.

70
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,530
And then he walked away.

71
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:32,570
And I was like, fuck it.

72
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,370
I need to sleep.

73
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:34,670
And then I wake up.

74
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:38,670
I wake up to him, like, on top of my legs.

75
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:39,590
Like a fucking cat.

76
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,210
You know like those cats that like...

77
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,990
Well, I don't have a cat, so I don't really know.

78
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:43,630
But...

79
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:46,310
But I've seen TV shows with cats in it.

80
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:47,090
But like...

81
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:49,290
And I've read books that had cats in it.

82
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,830
But anyway, you know like...

83
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,630
You know like when cats just like, lie on top of you.

84
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,650
And they're like, this is my spot now.

85
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,610
And he's just trying to rage bait me.

86
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:00,870
Anyway.

87
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,330
And so I woke up.

88
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,930
And then he was just like, lying there on top of my legs.

89
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:05,590
Just sleeping.

90
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:06,810
I was like, oh fuck.

91
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:07,290
Okay.

92
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,310
You're so comfy.

93
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:09,550
But I have to stream.

94
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:10,470
God damn.

95
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:11,890
So it's like...

96
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,150
It was so hard to move.

97
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:13,810
I just...

98
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:14,550
I just...

99
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,050
I don't know.

100
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:16,670
It was very difficult.

101
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,010
Because I'm like, oh...

102
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,210
But you're so comfy.

103
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,210
And like...

104
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:20,950
You're so...

105
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:21,650
You're asleep.

106
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,790
And you're comfy.

107
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,930
And you just, you know...

108
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,710
You have your spot.

109
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,390
And then I was just like...

110
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,950
And then I moved a little bit.

111
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,590
And then he was like, how dare you?

112
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,950
How dare my pillow start...

113
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,410
Start moving?

114
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:41,430
And then...

115
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,070
And then...

116
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,170
Yeah.

117
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,350
And then he just like, left.

118
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:44,490
And he's just like, you know...

119
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:45,170
Fuck you!

120
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,610
And he just like, got off the bed and just walked away.

121
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:56,230
Anyway, so yeah, that's why I was a little late.

122
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,290
A little late today.

123
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,090
He like, basically...

124
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,690
I couldn't move for around...

125
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:07,410
I think like, I stayed there in my bed for an extra 10 minutes.

126
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:10,630
Waiting for him to like, get the fuck off me.

127
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:11,770
But like, you know...

128
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:14,650
But I couldn't really like, do anything about it.

129
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:15,790
Because I just...

130
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:16,470
I felt really bad.

131
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,210
I just...

132
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,030
I was...

133
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,470
Held hostage by my dog.

134
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,270
Because like, I felt really bad.

135
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,950
Because he clearly found his spot.

136
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:27,210
Um...

137
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:28,210
And it was...

138
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,810
To be fair, I was a little selfish.

139
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:31,050
Because...

140
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:34,290
It has been a long time since...

141
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:36,650
I've let dad back on the bed.

142
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:37,850
Like, I never...

143
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,630
I haven't like, let him like, sleep with me in a long time.

144
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,310
So like, I was a little selfish there.

145
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,070
Because like, I did miss...

146
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,350
I did miss that.

147
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:46,710
You know?

148
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,890
Like, in the past, he would always sleep in my bed.

149
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,270
And like, you know, he would always like, be...

150
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:54,150
Like, cuddling up against me and stuff like that.

151
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,970
So I was a little selfish there.

152
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:56,930
Uh...

153
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:58,410
Um...

154
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,890
So I let him stay on top of my legs for a little longer.

155
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:01,690
Because of it.

156
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:02,650
Um...

157
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:03,110
I...

158
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,130
Recently, um...

159
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:05,410
Uh...

160
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:06,170
Okay, so...

161
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:07,090
Anyway...

162
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:07,450
Oh, I'm sorry.

163
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:08,490
My brain like, lagged there.

164
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:10,610
But...

165
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:11,410
Anyway...

166
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,370
That's a good segue to the fact that...

167
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,830
I will be taking three days off.

168
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,070
Tomorrow, Monday, and Tuesday.

169
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:19,250
Um...

170
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:22,370
Because I've been having like, brain fog lately.

171
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:23,390
Um...

172
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,910
Because of like, how much I've been working.

173
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:27,390
And...

174
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:27,830
Um...

175
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,910
So like, I've noticed that lately...

176
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:32,230
My brain has been like, lagging.

177
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,850
When it comes to like, talking and streaming.

178
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:36,750
And...

179
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,650
So like, I'm like, a little...

180
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:39,070
Like...

181
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,770
Like, I'm like, getting a bit tired.

182
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:41,630
Like, not a bit.

183
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:42,990
Like, I'm very tired.

184
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:45,610
I don't know...

185
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,470
I don't know if it's noticeable to you guys.

186
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:50,830
But like, I've been like, stumbling on my words a lot more.

187
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:53,530
Because my thoughts aren't coming out naturally.

188
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,470
As much as they used to.

189
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:56,630
Um...

190
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:59,090
And I think it's because like, I've been like, really tired.

191
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,050
And like, um...

192
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,550
Really like, stressed out lately.

193
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:03,610
Uh...

194
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:04,550
Yeah, more than usual.

195
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,270
It has been...

196
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:06,690
Um...

197
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,010
Happening a lot more than usual.

198
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,010
And so...

199
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,430
I'm definitely gonna try and take...

200
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:14,550
Three days off to see if I recover from it.

201
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,030
But...

202
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,450
If I don't recover from it for next week.

203
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,150
Um...

204
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,170
The week after that.

205
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:19,890
Um...

206
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,650
I'll take another three days off.

207
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:22,730
Um...

208
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:23,910
And see if that helps.

209
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,790
Because like, I've noticed it was particularly bad.

210
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:27,870
Um...

211
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:28,890
During the meet and greets.

212
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,150
Because...

213
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:30,830
Um...

214
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:31,990
I felt so bad too.

215
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,670
Because like, I'm like, oh I'm so sorry.

216
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,590
My brain's lagging.

217
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:35,770
Um...

218
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:36,270
Uh...

219
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,490
Because like, I've done so many meet and greets.

220
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:42,170
So like, it should be like, much more natural for me to like, interact with people.

221
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:42,930
Because...

222
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:43,310
Um...

223
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,330
Of how many I've done.

224
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,210
Over the last two years.

225
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:47,290
Or not even last two years.

226
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:47,810
But like...

227
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:48,470
I've done a lot.

228
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:49,210
But...

229
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:51,090
I've done a lot in general over the last year.

230
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:52,630
But...

231
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,770
During the meet and greet.

232
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:55,950
Uh...

233
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:56,730
Um...

234
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:57,750
I was like...

235
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,710
Stumbling a lot in my words.

236
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:00,930
And...

237
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:01,470
Uh...

238
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,890
And I was just like, oh I'm sorry!

239
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:04,090
Like...

240
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:05,170
Because like, they would say something.

241
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:09,070
And then it takes a little bit longer for me to respond back.

242
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,750
Because I was like, oh my gosh.

243
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,010
You know, like, I'm like, what do I say next?

244
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:13,610
Like...

245
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:17,850
So like, I've noticed that.

246
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:18,530
And it got...

247
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:19,050
I was like...

248
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,290
It was very noticeable for me.

249
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:21,670
During the meet and greet.

250
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:22,650
Because of how...

251
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,170
How much I've done it before.

252
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,530
And like, in the previous meet and greets.

253
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:27,190
I...

254
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,150
I would like...

255
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,750
Be much more natural when I'm like, talking with people.

256
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:31,630
Because you know...

257
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,950
My job is to talk.

258
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:35,110
But I was actually like, buffering Aira.

259
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:36,210
Like, I felt like...

260
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:37,770
Felt like I was going...

261
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:38,250
Like, you know...

262
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,910
In the past, I'd be at like, three ping.

263
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,510
And then...

264
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,050
Um...

265
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:42,930
But now I'm like...

266
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:45,950
I felt like I was connecting to the East Coast at the moment.

267
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:46,570
Like...

268
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,350
I felt like I was...

269
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,510
I was like...

270
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,510
Like a hundred ping for some fucking reason.

271
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,230
While I was like, doing meet and greet.

272
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,230
So I was like, oh man.

273
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:54,510
Okay.

274
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,410
I should really...

275
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:56,470
I should really chill.

276
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:57,590
Um...

277
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,190
I should really...

278
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:00,190
Like, take it easy in the next three days.

279
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,190
But like, not...

280
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:01,410
I...

281
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:04,170
I don't think I will be taking it too easy in the next three days.

282
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,270
Because I still have...

283
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,410
So much work to do!

284
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:08,970
So I still have...

285
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,230
A lot of work to do when it comes to like...

286
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:11,750
You know...

287
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,970
Everything for July.

288
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:16,210
Like the concert and the birthday and all that shit.

289
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,390
There's still so much stuff behind the scenes.

290
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:19,150
Oh, Gavin.

291
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,090
Thank you for super chat.

292
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:20,410
Thank you.

293
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:21,530
It's okay.

294
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:22,790
I'm sure I'll stumble in my words.

295
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,850
Did I get the chance to meet and greet my Oshie Bird?

296
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:25,370
Thank you.

297
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,590
Super chat, Gavin.

298
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:26,970
Thank you.

299
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:27,430
Thank you.

300
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,750
I didn't hope it wasn't that noticeable during...

301
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:30,410
To...

302
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:31,250
To the Dragoons.

303
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,350
During the meet and greet.

304
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:32,810
Because I felt...

305
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:33,190
Oh my gosh.

306
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,050
I felt so bad.

307
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:34,570
Because you know...

308
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,330
I always want to give you guys like...

309
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,030
The best experience.

310
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:38,290
Because I also have heard...

311
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,250
That off-kite.

312
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:40,550
Um...

313
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,270
For off-kite.

314
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,010
There was like...

315
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,450
My tickets sold out...

316
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:44,350
Incredibly fast.

317
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,790
For the meet and greet in general.

318
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:46,810
So like...

319
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:47,570
I was like...

320
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:47,930
Oh man.

321
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,230
I hope it wasn't too noticeable.

322
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:50,050
Like...

323
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,230
I wanted to make sure...

324
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:51,970
That you guys...

325
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,230
Have a great time...

326
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,090
Meet and greeting me.

327
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,570
And um...

328
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,070
And like...

329
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:57,230
You know...

330
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:57,870
Talking to me.

331
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:58,570
And hanging out.

332
00:12:58,570 --> 00:12:59,310
Uh...

333
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,430
And uh...

334
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:00,790
I know like...

335
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,350
I just...

336
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,150
I found that out.

337
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:02,910
I found out.

338
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,390
I didn't realize off-kite did this.

339
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,350
But like...

340
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:05,990
Um...

341
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,310
They had like...

342
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:07,790
Uh...

343
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,670
Special tickets.

344
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,750
Where you can get like...

345
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,350
Like um...

346
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,170
First...

347
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:13,990
VIP access.

348
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:15,290
To any...

349
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:15,790
Events.

350
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:16,930
Slash...

351
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:17,510
Meet and greets.

352
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,110
That they want.

353
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,030
So like...

354
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,850
Some people paid like...

355
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,470
Two thousand plus dollars.

356
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:24,790
Um...

357
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,230
Two thousand plus dollars.

358
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,170
Just so they can like...

359
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:28,750
Uh...

360
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,030
Secure me cheat tickets.

361
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,390
I didn't realize that was a thing.

362
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:32,150
Uh...

363
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,610
To a fair I don't pay attention to anything.

364
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:34,110
Anymore.

365
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,050
That's what my staff.

366
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:39,910
That's my staff's job.

367
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:41,670
I just say yes to like...

368
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:41,810
Meeting...

369
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:43,590
They just be like you want to do a meet and greet?

370
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,430
And I was like yes.

371
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,870
I didn't know like...

372
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,590
That's a thing that some conventions do.

373
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:49,050
Um...

374
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:49,490
But I like...

375
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,070
I only found that up...

376
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:53,070
Because I was talking to a Dragoon.

377
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:54,470
Like during a meet and greet.

378
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:55,390
And they're like...

379
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,510
Oh yea like...

380
00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:03,250
Um, I just paid $2,000 so I can get this meet-and-greet because I was... I was saying, like, Oh, man, you're so lucky!

381
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:09,530
You won the... you won the lottery, slash, uh, you were able to get, like, a meet-and-greet ticket because I heard it was super hard to get.

382
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,670
And then the dragon was like, No!

383
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,090
I just... you see this?

384
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:18,850
I bought... paid $2,000 just so I can, uh, secure all my meet-and-greet tickets.

385
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,310
And I was like, Wait, what?

386
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:25,070
I was like, Holy shit!

387
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,810
IRL paid a win?

388
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,150
Like...

389
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,210
You know what's funny, though?

390
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,610
That ticket was called Whale.

391
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:41,030
The ticket... the... the ticket was specifically called the Whale ticket.

392
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:45,890
And then... but then he was like, Oh, no, no, this isn't even the most expensive ticket.

393
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:48,050
There's one for $7,000.

394
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,510
And I was like, What the f...

395
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,450
What... what do you get for $7,000?

396
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,170
Yeah, I don't know!

397
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,850
I was like...

398
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:57,270
What... what can they offer even more?

399
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,970
For $7,000?

400
00:14:59,070 --> 00:14:59,650
I was so...

401
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,350
I... I need to look this up, actually.

402
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:02,170
No, I'm curious.

403
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:03,870
I... I actually want to know.

404
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:05,730
Alright, Offkai Expo ticket.

405
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,930
I... I need to know what they offer.

406
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,470
Even more than $2,000.

407
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:14,010
Cause I was like, Well, like, you know, you get, like, first access.

408
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:18,770
Like, you know, um, first access to, like, everything.

409
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:22,730
Because, obviously, it's, like, really hard to, like, uh...

410
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:24,930
Uh... be able to get the things you wanna...

411
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,130
Like, you know, do the things you wanna do.

412
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,650
If the tickets sell out super fast.

413
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:28,930
I'm curious now.

414
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,050
Oh, I can't to make an account.

415
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:30,470
Goddamn.

416
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,350
Who has an account?

417
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:40,190
Guys, who... who... who has the account?

418
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,050
Okay, I need to know.

419
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:41,630
Okay.

420
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:43,490
Yes, there's, uh...

421
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:44,950
The GigaChad ticket.

422
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,370
Nearly every upbeat tier.

423
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,490
Double rainbow.

424
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,070
Well, GigaChad.

425
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:53,870
Were basically donations with extra goodies and priority in lines.

426
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:54,430
Oh, okay.

427
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,830
So that's basically, you get, like, extra items.

428
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:59,030
And I guess, like, more priority?

429
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:02,330
I guess it would make sense if, like, you know...

430
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,990
If there's, like, limited tickets for meet and greets.

431
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:07,190
For, like, even more bigger VTubers.

432
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,530
And then, like, you know, maybe the...

433
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:10,370
The...

434
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,110
You know, you wanna get GigaChad.

435
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,270
Because there's too many GigaChad VIP tickets.

436
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,150
The 7k ones.

437
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,650
That would snag up all the other tickets.

438
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:17,850
And then...

439
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:20,490
And then, like, you know, you wanna make sure that...

440
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:20,730
Uh...

441
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,570
Yeah, you wanna outrank the whales, basically.

442
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,190
So, like, the whales don't steal...

443
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:24,770
Like, you don't...

444
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,650
You're worried that the whales would take all the tickets.

445
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:29,290
Yeah, it's, like, the faster pass ticket.

446
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:35,510
The extra extreme fast ticket.

447
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,110
J.R., thank you for the super chat.

448
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:39,930
Thank you, thank you.

449
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,190
Doki takes off glasses.

450
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,270
Me, haha, great story.

451
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:43,430
I'm sorry, who are you?

452
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,450
Also, P.S., take as many breaks as you need.

453
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:47,790
You deserve a vacate, judging from how much you do in a week.

454
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:48,890
Mental health is important.

455
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:49,730
Thank you for the super chat.

456
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:50,530
Thank you, thank you.

457
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:53,150
The Giga chat versus Will conflict.

458
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:57,430
Laird paid a win.

459
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:05,490
Yeah, because I was confused because, like, earlier, in an earlier meet and greet, Dragoon was like, yeah, like, because, like, there was another Dragoon.

460
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:09,870
Oh, yeah, by the way, sorry, there was one Dragoon that came over there.

461
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:11,430
All right, sorry, he wasn't even a Dragoon.

462
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,230
He was like, oh, yeah, I'm not a Dragoon.

463
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:14,370
I'm only here for my friend.

464
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:22,190
And I was wondering, he was like, I was wondering, like, if you could say something to her on stream and, like, mentioned her name.

465
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:24,470
And I was like, yeah, yeah, sure, I can do that.

466
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,750
Anyway, he said, fuck you, Nicole.

467
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:33,250
You said, fuck you, Nicole.

468
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:36,170
I got to meet Doki Bird and you didn't.

469
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,810
Anyway, that's his message to you, Nicole.

470
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,950
You wanted me to tell you that specifically.

471
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:47,070
All right, back to back to the meet and greet.

472
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:59,190
There was another Dragoon earlier who was like, yeah, he was like, I was saying, like, oh, and he was like, dripped out in Doki merch.

473
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:03,590
Like, you know, when I say buy my merch, this guy was like, bet, like, he actually bought all my merch.

474
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:07,350
And so he was like, show me all the merch that he had, except for my socks.

475
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,430
He didn't have my socks.

476
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:15,670
But anyway, he was like, he was like, yeah, but, like, you know, I'm not a true whaler.

477
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,010
And I was so confused.

478
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,510
I was like, what the fuck is he?

479
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:20,110
And he, like, pointed to his badge.

480
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,430
I was so confused.

481
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:25,250
I was like, I didn't understand what he meant by that.

482
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:27,650
Because obviously, I didn't know about the ticket system.

483
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:34,730
Like, I didn't realize because it was like, yeah, I just got the general, the general card.

484
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:36,830
And I was like, what the fuck does he mean?

485
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,050
But then I didn't want to be, like, make it awkward.

486
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,290
And I was like, ha ha, yeah.

487
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:43,790
So, you know, like, when you're talking to somebody and, like, you didn't hear what they said.

488
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:44,770
Or you don't really understand.

489
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:49,570
And then your only response back is like, ha ha ha, yeah, ha ha.

490
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,170
It's like, you didn't want to make things awkward.

491
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:54,670
Because I didn't understand.

492
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:57,190
It's like, ha ha, yeah, ha ha.

493
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:01,650
And the laughing nod.

494
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,210
Oh, yeah, that thing.

495
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,270
That's crazy.

496
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:07,710
Yeah, that's crazy.

497
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:12,710
Yeah, because I did have context of what the fuck he meant.

498
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:19,830
But then, after him, I finally understood what that guy meant when he was like, yeah, I only have the general ticket.

499
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,950
Like, I'm not that big of a fan.

500
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,550
I only have the general ticket.

501
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,770
And like, so now I understand.

502
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:29,330
Yep.

503
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:41,910
I do hope everyone who did manage to get a meet-and-greet ticket did have a good time.

504
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:46,050
I'm really sorry if I was stumbling on my words.

505
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:49,390
But I always love meeting my dragoons during these meet-and-greets.

506
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:52,410
And I know some of you guys are like, no, I found my...

507
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:58,490
But, oh, okay.

508
00:19:59,070 --> 00:19:59,310
Okay.

509
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:08,490
Apparently, um, this is why I don't personally, um, why, like, sometimes, like, I don't go out often.

510
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:12,410
Because, like, uh, but, um, not, not that...

511
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:13,610
Wait, no, that's not what I'm gonna say.

512
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,030
But the brain fog hits.

513
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:19,510
The brain fog's hitting right now.

514
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:28,150
Yeah, um, but, um, apparently people were saying about the smell of the convention.

515
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:36,570
And then, and then, and I saw a tweet from someone that was like, FOMO eliminated.

516
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:42,900
I saw, I saw that, yeah.

517
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:46,120
And then, I, I thought it was crazy.

518
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:52,360
Because, um, uh, there was, like, deodorant being sold at the convention.

519
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:59,460
And, um, and, uh, and, like, they were, they were apparently sold out by day two.

520
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,680
And I was like, oh my god, wait, that's real?

521
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:07,320
I've never been to a convention where, like, it would smell that bad.

522
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:13,140
But to be fair, I will admit, I will admit, I have a really bad nose.

523
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,220
Like, I actually can't smell very well.

524
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:21,060
Um, so, like, unless it's, like, really, really bad.

525
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:33,780
Like, so, I've only, for me, IRL, I've only been to, like, five conventions, uh, in my entire life.

526
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:40,080
So, I've never actually, like, had an experience where it just didn't smell great.

527
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:48,760
Like, I guess it doesn't help that it's really, really hot, too, during the summer.

528
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,680
Especially in, like, what, uh, where is it in California?

529
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:59,700
I assume it's really hot in California right now, because it's like, you know, What's that Katy Perry song?

530
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:07,800
Uh, that is, that is, like, my only, uh, California girls.

531
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:16,100
That's my only reference to California.

532
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,880
It seemed really hot in that... Oh, it's in LA?

533
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:19,760
Oh, shit, sorry.

534
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:20,860
Wait, it's in LA?

535
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,580
Oh, no, there's no catchy songs.

536
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,000
Based on LA.

537
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,180
Goddammit, why wasn't it in California?

538
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,560
Ramona, thank you for the Akasupa.

539
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,200
Thank you.

540
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:40,940
Thank you.

541
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,860
Oh, it's San Francisco.

542
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:43,980
We were all wrong.

543
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,540
It's not... It's in San Francisco.

544
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,340
Songs about San Francisco.

545
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,920
Okay, we were all wrong.

546
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,500
It wasn't in LA or California.

547
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,420
It was in San Francisco.

548
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:00,220
All right, any good songs from San Francisco?

549
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,420
Oh, there's none.

550
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:05,120
I don't know any of these songs about San Francisco.

551
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:10,960
Wait, San Francisco is still California?

552
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,260
Oh, I am right!

553
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:12,880
I knew it!

554
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,320
California girls...

555
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,260
Yay!

556
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,600
I was right!

557
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,380
Guys, I don't know my states.

558
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,320
Okay, I will show you guys how bad.

559
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:31,980
My knowledge is of the American state.

560
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:32,300
Okay.

561
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:40,460
Unnamed... Unnamed map... Sorry, I know we were here for Elden Ring.

562
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,280
I... United States!

563
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,020
This is my knowledge.

564
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,900
Of the United States.

565
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:53,520
I don't know... Like, sometimes I don't know what is the city and which is the state.

566
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,460
All right, here we go.

567
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,180
I'll show you guys.

568
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,340
I will prove to you guys how bad it is.

569
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:01,520
Um, so you can't judge me for my lack of knowledge of America.

570
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,820
All right, so this is America, right?

571
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,400
Okay, this will be my... This is my cursor.

572
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,840
This is gonna be my mouse cursor.

573
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:13,140
This is... This is everything I know about America.

574
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:14,900
Alaska.

575
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:16,840
Hawaii.

576
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:18,760
Florida.

577
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:19,780
Florida.

578
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:20,300
Because it's a penis.

579
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,640
That's how I could remember.

580
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,200
About...

581
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,600
About...

582
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,900
Where Florida is.

583
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,240
That's Florida because it's the penis.

584
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,740
And then that's it.

585
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,640
Wait, wait, wait.

586
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,340
Texas.

587
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,820
Because it looks like a...

588
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,520
It looks like a steak.

589
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,500
And then that's Texas.

590
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:48,520
And then I assume this is New York right here.

591
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:49,380
I...

592
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:57,890
And then I assume this is New York City.

593
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:01,410
And then California is right here.

594
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,830
And then that's California.

595
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:08,770
And then Seattle is like here or something, I think.

596
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:09,210
Wait, no.

597
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,050
Oh, no.

598
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,030
Seattle is a city.

599
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:13,650
Oh, Washington is right here.

600
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:20,070
And then Ohio is like in the middle.

601
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:22,310
So, like, I'll say it's right here.

602
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,670
This is where Ohio is.

603
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:26,050
And...

604
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,070
And that's it.

605
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,270
That's actually all I know.

606
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:34,670
And then states that I do know...

607
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:37,070
States I know exist.

608
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,950
But, like, I don't know where they are.

609
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:40,350
I'll just put Michigan.

610
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,770
It will be right here.

611
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:43,950
Louisiana, I don't know.

612
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:45,330
You might be here.

613
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:48,650
Maybe Louisiana might be over here.

614
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:51,510
Ohio, I don't know.

615
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:52,750
Maybe you'll be here, Ohio.

616
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:53,790
You can live here.

617
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:58,630
Mississippi.

618
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:00,590
Wait, no.

619
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:01,670
Mississippi is...

620
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:04,170
Is Mississippi a state or a river?

621
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:05,570
Okay, Missouri.

622
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:05,690
Missouri.

623
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,230
I know Missouri is a real thing.

624
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,770
So, Missouri, you go here.

625
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,550
And then...

626
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:18,510
And then South Dakota, I guess you can be here.

627
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:27,440
And then Las Vegas, I'll put you right here.

628
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,660
Las Vegas, you can be here.

629
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,380
You can live here.

630
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,140
That seems like a Las Vegas spot.

631
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,720
No, wait, Nevada.

632
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:34,820
Sorry, Nevada.

633
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,520
Las Vegas is the city.

634
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:37,540
Nevada.

635
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,880
You can live here.

636
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:42,720
And...

637
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,820
Oh, I have a friend that used to live in Arkansas.

638
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,000
And her dad, like, ran Walmart.

639
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,680
So, I'll put you here.

640
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,900
Because, like, Walmart is, like...

641
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,580
Like...

642
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,680
Arkansas was, like, the state of Walmart.

643
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,140
So, I'll put you over here.

644
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,240
Because that looks like a good Walmart place to live in.

645
00:26:59,400 --> 00:26:59,740
Uh...

646
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,020
And...

647
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,240
Then...

648
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:02,780
Uh...

649
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,300
What else exists in America?

650
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,480
Um...

651
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,040
Okay.

652
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,900
Where does the pres...

653
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,780
The president lives in Washington, D.C.

654
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,340
And that's where Seattle is.

655
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,340
Uh...

656
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:14,940
So, I already...

657
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,540
I already put Seattle.

658
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:17,160
Oh!

659
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,360
Kentucky Fried Chicken!

660
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:19,880
KFC?

661
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,020
You can live...

662
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:22,720
I don't know.

663
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,620
You can live here.

664
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,680
Kentucky can be here.

665
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,260
For Kentucky Fried Chicken.

666
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:35,840
Um...

667
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,140
And...

668
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,040
Because, like, that looks like a chicken if you think of...

669
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,320
It looks like a little chicken nuggie if you think about it.

670
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,080
So, that's where Kentucky is.

671
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:44,740
Uh...

672
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,940
I'm doing...

673
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:49,340
I'm, like, the teacher that's doing assigned seating right now.

674
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:52,740
And it is where Kentucky deserves to be.

675
00:27:52,740 --> 00:28:18,140
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,

676
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:26,780
ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha What are you... Oh my god, it's like you guys in like fucking measurements and temperature.

677
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,420
Why would you... Why would you name two things Washington?

678
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,240
That doesn't make sense!

679
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,140
Uh, New Jersey?

680
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:38,520
I think like New Jersey and Florida are like close to each other, right?

681
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:43,080
So, because they're both like the safer reality TV shows.

682
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:48,140
So I'll put New Jersey right here next to Florida because like you guys can be neighbors.

683
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,960
Um, no one knows.

684
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,940
No one knows.

685
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,260
Um, Katz, thank you for the super chat.

686
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,200
Thank you, thank you.

687
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,200
If vibe teaching was a thing, it would be... it would be this.

688
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,520
Um, Papa Smurf, thank you for the super chat.

689
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,500
Thank you, thank you.

690
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,520
Can you fill out a map and link it so we can reference?

691
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,240
Okay, and then...

692
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,420
New Orleans!

693
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,080
I know we're new... I know what New Orleans is.

694
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,320
because, um, because of Princess and the Frog.

695
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:28,060
So, uh, New Orleans would be like right here next to Texas because you guys both have good food.

696
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,180
So I feel like you guys can supply each other some good food.

697
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:36,860
So I will sign... your seating should be a sign... will be a sign right here.

698
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:41,740
Uh, next to... uh... next to Texas.

699
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:46,960
Uh, and then... uh... uh...

700
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,940
Is there anything else that... is that everything?

701
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,240
I think that's all 50 states.

702
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:57,480
I think that's all... that's... that's all 50 states, right?

703
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,020
I got 50, right?

704
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,000
Uh...

705
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,520
I'm pretty sure.

706
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,040
It sounds like I got all 50, guys.

707
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,060
Um...

708
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,120
Yeah, I think that's it.

709
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,460
I think that's all the important ones.

710
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:12,860
Why did I just say that?

711
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:13,260
Wait!

712
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:20,380
I think... I think I named all 50 important... all 50 states, guys.

713
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,500
Alright, so anyway.

714
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:24,380
That's my knowledge... of... um...

715
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,580
All the states that I know.

716
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,200
Uh...

717
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,380
Gaku, thank you for the super chat.

718
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,720
Thank you, thank you.

719
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:35,900
Uh...

720
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,240
U.S.

721
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,340
has Washington, D.C.

722
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,300
and Washington State.

723
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,200
Which are separate.

724
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,380
We also have... um...

725
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,220
We also have...

726
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,940
Vancouver, WA.

727
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,340
Vancouver, Washington?

728
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,480
Wait, what the fuck?

729
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,160
Which came first?

730
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,720
Wait, which Vancouver was first?

731
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:55,840
What the fuck?

732
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,600
You just, like, stole Vancouver from Canada?

733
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,400
You're like, that's a good name.

734
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,840
I'm gonna make it mine.

735
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:03,960
Um...

736
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,180
Doug, thank you for the super chat.

737
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:05,940
Thank you, thank you.

738
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:06,740
What about West?

739
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,560
There's a West...

740
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,420
Wait, is there a...

741
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,060
Wait, do you have all Dakotas?

742
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:10,400
Okay.

743
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,040
Alright.

744
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,540
Okay, I'll assign...

745
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:12,960
I'll assign...

746
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,920
West Dakota a seat, too.

747
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,060
Alright, since West Dakota is in the West...

748
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:20,740
I'll put West Dakota right here.

749
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,680
And then East Dakota would be right here.

750
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,840
Oh my god, it's so tiny.

751
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,340
Would be like that one.

752
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:28,960
One of the...

753
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,240
One of the blocks in here.

754
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,080
You know that one?

755
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,220
That would be East Dakota.

756
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,820
And then South Dakota can be...

757
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,080
Right here.

758
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,420
Next to...

759
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:42,320
Next to New Jersey and Florida.

760
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,120
Uh...

761
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,300
You guys can be freaks together.

762
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,240
Uh...

763
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:45,820
And then...

764
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,060
North Dakota...

765
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,740
Can be like...

766
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,380
Did I sign a seat here yet?

767
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,140
North Dakota can be...

768
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,280
Can sit right here.

769
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:57,720
Uh...

770
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,500
What about...

771
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,580
Alright, so...

772
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,440
West Dakota...

773
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,320
North Dakota...

774
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,700
East Dakota...

775
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,900
South Dakota...

776
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,420
South Dakota...

777
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:09,920
South Dakota...

778
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,440
South Dakota...

779
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:10,460
South Dakota...

780
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:10,720
South Dakota...

781
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:10,780
South Dakota...

782
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:10,800
South Dakota...

783
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,740
South Dakota...

784
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,660
South Dakota...

785
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,320
South Dakota...

786
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,660
South Dakota...

787
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,480
South Dakota...

788
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,020
South Dakota...

789
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:20,940
South Dakota...

790
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,540
South Dakota...

791
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,860
South Dakota...

792
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,320
South Dakota...

793
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:33,700
South Dakota...

794
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,460
Live right here.

795
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,020
This looks like a good place to live in.

796
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:41,000
So, a normal Virginian will live here.

797
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:48,260
But if you're in West Virginia, you can live right here, next to California.

798
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,700
I think that's where I put California.

799
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:53,260
So you live right here, next to California.

800
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,420
And then, East Virginia, you can be next to New York City.

801
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,240
Oh, you can be next to Kentucky!

802
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,800
Okay, we can get all the Kentucky Fried Chicken.

803
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:09,700
So you can be right here, next to Kentucky, for East Virginia.

804
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:15,780
And then, South Virginia, I'll put you next to New Orleans in Texas, right here.

805
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,540
So, yeah, that's where South Virginia is.

806
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,680
I'm so confused.

807
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:28,560
Guys...

808
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,700
Guys, why do you guys have so many states?

809
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:36,300
We have like, I don't know, like six provinces.

810
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,780
Why the fuck do you need 50 states?

811
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,080
And Canada...

812
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,640
Canada is like the second biggest country in the world!

813
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,760
And we have like, six provinces!

814
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,800
Why do you have like...

815
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,800
Wait, you guys are 51?

816
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,260
When did you guys get a new province?

817
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,640
I'm sorry, a new state.

818
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:56,760
Um...

819
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:00,400
How many states do Americans have...

820
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,660
Does America have...

821
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,740
Wait, when the fuck did you get plus one?

822
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,160
Oh no, it's...

823
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,480
Okay, someone was gaslighting me.

824
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:08,400
Uh...

825
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,040
Okay.

826
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,640
Canada is the 51st.

827
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:15,540
How many provinces in Canada?

828
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,360
Okay, we have ten.

829
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,280
Sorry, I deleted like Saskatchewan and...

830
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:20,780
Wait, Saskatchewan...

831
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,000
Uh...

832
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,680
Oh wait, Saskatchewan isn't a province.

833
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:23,980
Sorry.

834
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,740
I deleted Quebec and...

835
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:32,100
I deleted Quebec and like...

836
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,880
I don't know, the Yukon.

837
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,140
Um...

838
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:38,340
I deleted a couple of provinces in my mind.

839
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,200
Sorry, we have...

840
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,460
Oh wait, Saskatchewan, Israel!

841
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,480
Never mind.

842
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,320
I...

843
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,160
I already preemptively deleted Saskatchewan away from...

844
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:46,720
In my head.

845
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,820
Sorry, I...

846
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,920
I'm making a lot of enemies today.

847
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:55,760
And that's why I'm taking a three day break after today.

848
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,200
Um...

849
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:58,340
Um...

850
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,560
Anyway, we had ten...

851
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:03,120
Okay, ten provinces is still less than 50 though.

852
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,380
Um...

853
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:04,940
Yes...

854
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:07,860
Okay, we needed 50 states because California has only...

855
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:11,540
One million less people than all of Canada combined!

856
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,080
What the fuck?

857
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,340
Wait, that can't be real!

858
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,180
There's no way!

859
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,020
Jane, thank you for the super chat.

860
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:17,920
Thank you, thank you.

861
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:18,920
How many people...

862
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,240
Live...

863
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,080
Why the fuck do all you guys live in California?

864
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,920
California girls...

865
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,140
paid by da da da...

866
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,780
Team bump bum...

867
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,300
Ba da da da na...

868
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:32,280
Okay 39.43 million...

869
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,880
People live in California.

870
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,540
How many...

871
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,220
People...

872
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,440
Live in...

873
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:37,760
Canada?

874
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:40,240
What...

875
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:40,420
What?

876
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,600
That can't be real!

877
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,780
What the fuck?!

878
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,900
There's... What?!

879
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,420
Shit!

880
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:52,830
You have... Oh my god!

881
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:55,650
Technically... Technically, guys.

882
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:57,850
You think about it.

883
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:02,130
California can take over the entire country of Australia.

884
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:05,130
If you guys really want to try.

885
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:06,370
Yeah!

886
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:11,830
I... I did not know this, but...

887
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:21,970
Apparently... Apparently... If you guys try hard enough... If we... You can actually just invade Australia.

888
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:24,570
And it won't even be, like, close.

889
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:32,090
It won't even... It won't... It won't even be close.

890
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:33,790
If you wanted to.

891
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:36,590
You can actually just take over Australia.

892
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:40,290
Uh... Don't give them... Just California, though.

893
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:41,290
Like, we just, like...

894
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:44,030
Like, what we did to the... Australians... Back then.

895
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:46,390
Um... If America really wanted to.

896
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:52,130
They can, like, just... Ship the entire population... Of... California... To Australia.

897
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:54,930
And then it'll just be... It'll be the 51st state.

898
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:58,390
If we... If you try... Just a little bit.

899
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:08,040
If you... Just saw... Oh, it's like that... Bugs Bunny gif.

900
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,600
Where they, like, saw Florida.

901
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,220
And then it, like, rides away to Australia.

902
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,480
Like... Wait.

903
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,160
We can send the Floridians over.

904
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,480
How many people live in Florida?

905
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,380
I'm sorry.

906
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,480
I should have been playing Elden Ring, but... I should be playing Elden Ring right now.

907
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:24,140
But, like, this is way too... This is way too interesting for me.

908
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:28,060
Knowing that you can actually take over on... Oh, we can... Oh, wait.

909
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:28,200
No.

910
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:28,540
Never mind.

911
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,860
You're missing 3 million people.

912
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:30,140
Yeah.

913
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,860
We can't send the... We can't send the Floridians.

914
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,340
They need, like, 3 million more people to invade Australia.

915
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,340
Sorry, guys.

916
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,740
The Floridians are safe right now.

917
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,060
Anyway, let's...

918
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,840
Let's get... Put up Elden Ring.

919
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:44,360
Sorry.

920
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,620
That was, like, I... That's what I mean.

921
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,180
I need... I need 3 days off.

922
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,620
My brain is not, like, focused anymore.

923
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,240
I'm... I am not focused at all.

924
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,720
I'm all over the place.

925
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,900
I think, like, I basically pissed off, like... 70% of my track.

926
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:04,800
Let's try to name... Try to name the 50 states.

927
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,460
But I did name all 50.

928
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:09,160
They might not... I might not have been able to assign them correctly.

929
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,420
In the... In their... In their correct seats.

930
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,920
But I did name all 50 states.

931
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,660
Uh... I was so locked in.

932
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:15,980
Yeah.

933
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,080
Fat cat.

934
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,720
Thank you for the super chat.

935
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,100
Thank you.

936
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:23,780
Thank you.

937
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,180
We lost the emu war.

938
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,720
And the kangaroos outnumber us.

939
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,860
It was over before it began.

940
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,680
Oh, I recently found this out.

941
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,020
About... Um... Kangaroo.

942
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:33,480
Like, yeah.

943
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,280
Also, by the way.

944
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:38,360
Um... But... I think I... I might not have ADHD.

945
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,400
But I'm, like... I'm going... I'm going through...

946
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,360
Like, an ADHD simulator right now.

947
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,220
With how... Uh... Tired.

948
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,500
And... And... Like... Ping diff right now.

949
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,240
In my brain.

950
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:58,780
Um... I can't believe America is, like... Um... 50% Dakotas.

951
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,000
And 50%... Uh... Virginia.

952
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,620
With the whole... North, East, West, South Dakota.

953
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,880
And North, East, West, South Virginia.

954
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,200
Alright.

955
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:10,840
Let's see.

956
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:11,380
Where is my...

957
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,160
Elden Ring sound volume?

958
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:13,940
Alright.

959
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,280
11... Uh... 0.1 right here.

960
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:17,600
Okay.

961
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,520
Uh... I think I got... Let me see.

962
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:24,720
Make sure I got all my settings correct for this.

963
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:29,760
I'm trying to see if this fixes the lag issue that... The stutter issue I had in Elden Ring.

964
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,900
Um... That's why I was, like, looking through a guide on it.

965
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,700
So I'm going to see if that fixes it.

966
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:36,460
Alright.

967
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,120
I will not buy the DLC.

968
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,760
I'm in Maryland.

969
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:44,360
I'm in Maryland.

970
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,000
That's North Virginia.

971
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:46,880
Wait.

972
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,100
What is that context of?

973
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,320
Sorry.

974
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,560
You're in North Virginia now.

975
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,980
As a non-American, I can confirm.

976
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:00,700
Alright.

977
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,040
Doki GeoGuessr went... Look.

978
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:08,800
If you look hard enough, you might find... The archive... Of me trying to name all 50 states.

979
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,800
And I think it was a lot worse.

980
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:15,420
Yeah.

981
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:22,300
I'm pretty sure... Um... I'm pretty sure... Um... I'm pretty sure it was definitely a lot worse... Than it is now.

982
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,940
Um... Oh, did I read the Akasupa?

983
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:27,360
I don't remember.

984
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:27,540
Oh.

985
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,180
Um... Pilgrim, thank you for the Akasupa.

986
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:30,640
Thank you.

987
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:31,300
Thank you.

988
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:32,280
Hi, Doki.

989
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,660
Loving the new outfit.

990
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,100
Sorry.

991
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,440
I was, like, super locked in with... With naming the 50 states.

992
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,320
Uh... You look amazing in it.

993
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,100
Also, it's my birthday tomorrow.

994
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,400
Uh... Can I get a happy birthday for my one and only Kamiyoshi?

995
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:45,260
Of course!

996
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,120
Happy birthday to you.

997
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,920
Happy birthday to you.

998
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,400
Happy birthday, dear Ramona.

999
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,460
Happy birthday to you.

1000
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:53,980
Yeah!

1001
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,320
Happy birthday!

1002
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:56,440
Woo!

1003
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:58,560
Okay.

1004
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,040
Alright.

1005
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,280
I... You remember how I played this game again?

1006
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,760
I know it's been, like, a couple...

1007
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,280
I know it's been, like, two days.

1008
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,640
I gotta remember how I played it again.

1009
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,840
Uh... Do I need to up... Do I have enough to upgrade, actually?

1010
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,440
No, I have to do dungeons for that.

1011
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,020
And I... I don't...

1012
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:17,460
I... I don't know where the next dungeon is.

1013
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,160
I remember.

1014
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,060
I don't have the stone.

1015
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,600
How the fuck do I...

1016
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,800
Press this map?

1017
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:22,980
How do I act...

1018
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:23,220
No!

1019
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:23,840
I don't want to...

1020
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,420
Okay, it's fine.

1021
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:24,900
It's fine.

1022
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:25,880
It's fine.

1023
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:27,620
We'll just go use this map.

1024
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:29,660
Um...

1025
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,000
Let's go this way.

1026
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,040
Where did I kill the teacher?

1027
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,560
Where did I kill her?

1028
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,080
Oh, here?

1029
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:36,800
Raya?

1030
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,640
Yeah, there it is.

1031
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,160
That's where I killed her.

1032
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,480
I don't remember where she was.

1033
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,140
Ugh!

1034
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:53,040
And then we'll go from here.

1035
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,540
We'll figure out our path from here.

1036
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:56,980
Whoops.

1037
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,840
Sorry, I had to look at my...

1038
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,760
Check something real quick.

1039
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:00,780
Oh, yeah!

1040
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,420
I almost forgot my tangent does.

1041
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:02,940
Oh, yeah.

1042
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:06,300
But...

1043
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:06,980
Did you guys know?

1044
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:09,420
Um...

1045
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,080
Oh, no.

1046
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:10,700
Guys, sorry.

1047
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:11,180
I fucked up.

1048
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:11,880
I tabbed out.

1049
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,460
I tabbed out my game.

1050
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,280
And I can't tab back in.

1051
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:15,820
Give me...

1052
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,780
I'm such a mess right now.

1053
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:18,760
I'm so...

1054
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,440
Guys, I'm such a mess.

1055
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,120
It won't let me tab back in.

1056
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:22,720
No!

1057
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:24,980
Okay, wait.

1058
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:25,900
I got this.

1059
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,540
Okay, I'm at the reboot Elden Ring.

1060
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:28,460
Oh, there you go.

1061
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:28,840
Never mind.

1062
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:29,360
I got it.

1063
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:29,880
Okay.

1064
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,580
So, did you guys know that, like, apparently, kangaroos...

1065
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,100
Um...

1066
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,140
When they jump...

1067
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:37,300
It sounds like they're walking.

1068
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,740
Like, it sounds like a human person walking.

1069
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,520
What does she do again?

1070
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,980
Oh, she resets stuff for me.

1071
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:47,480
Never mind.

1072
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:48,860
We don't need that.

1073
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:50,840
Also, we need to get rid of all these blues.

1074
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,500
I gotta get rid of it.

1075
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:54,640
Did I do it?

1076
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:56,880
Where did I put all of them?

1077
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:57,840
Oh, there is one.

1078
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:59,280
And there's one.

1079
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:00,260
Alright.

1080
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,680
How do I leave your house, ma'am?

1081
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:05,800
How do I leave?

1082
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,920
You just have one entrance?

1083
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:10,380
Oh.

1084
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:11,920
Oh, the death counter!

1085
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:12,620
Oh, my God.

1086
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:16,920
Guys, this is what I need.

1087
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:18,800
This is why I'm taking three days off.

1088
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,560
I'm all over the place right now.

1089
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,700
I also just remembered the death counter.

1090
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:24,580
Alright.

1091
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:25,540
I think it's this.

1092
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,080
There you go.

1093
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:27,500
There you go.

1094
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:28,940
Now we're ready, guys.

1095
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,180
We're ready for real.

1096
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:32,780
What do I do here?

1097
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:35,080
Is that it?

1098
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,140
Go back down?

1099
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:37,820
Okay.

1100
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,020
I'm just, like, wondering where do I...

1101
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:46,850
What do I do now?

1102
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:48,330
I just leave?

1103
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:49,270
Just like that?

1104
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:52,090
My job here is done?

1105
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:58,050
Yeah, but I talked to...

1106
00:43:58,050 --> 00:43:59,230
I think I talked to...

1107
00:43:59,230 --> 00:43:59,530
Oh.

1108
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:00,450
Okay.

1109
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:01,670
I just want to get rid of him first.

1110
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:03,150
But how much...

1111
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:03,310
Okay.

1112
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:04,490
I already upgraded my souls.

1113
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:05,510
That's good to know.

1114
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:07,050
So I am a little stronger.

1115
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:08,050
Which is noticeable.

1116
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:09,290
Thank you, guys.

1117
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:14,470
I don't know.

1118
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:14,610
I remember.

1119
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:15,650
Where does this leave me again?

1120
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:16,670
Oh, it was the shortcut.

1121
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:17,090
I remember.

1122
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:17,530
Okay.

1123
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:18,470
I think...

1124
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:20,310
I think I can take them now.

1125
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:21,150
Oh, wait.

1126
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:21,690
Not these guys.

1127
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:22,370
No, I don't...

1128
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:25,490
I thought...

1129
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:25,950
Wait.

1130
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:27,610
I think I can take them.

1131
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:30,250
You know those people in the big rock area?

1132
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:34,130
I think I can beat them up.

1133
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:35,750
Watch this.

1134
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:37,410
I'm stronger now.

1135
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:38,990
This is my beach episode.

1136
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:43,710
This is...

1137
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:44,910
This is my beach episode.

1138
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:46,530
I believe I can take them now.

1139
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:47,330
Alright.

1140
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:48,190
It's this one.

1141
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:50,910
And then...

1142
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:51,390
Okay.

1143
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:51,990
There's the ladder.

1144
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:52,990
Alright.

1145
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:54,290
I just want to make sure...

1146
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:54,770
No.

1147
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:55,390
I can't summon.

1148
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:55,750
Okay.

1149
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:56,990
Alright.

1150
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:59,250
I'm stronger and faster.

1151
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:01,930
I have less clothes on.

1152
00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:03,310
Which means I'm more aerodynamic.

1153
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:05,590
Alright.

1154
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:07,450
First off.

1155
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:07,810
Behind.

1156
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:08,970
Oh, shit.

1157
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:10,610
That was a good message.

1158
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:12,910
Oh, wait.

1159
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:14,310
That was actually a really good message.

1160
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:18,370
If only I had...

1161
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:20,090
Alright.

1162
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:20,850
Okay.

1163
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:21,610
Before I do.

1164
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:22,730
Let me...

1165
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:28,610
Alright.

1166
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:29,890
Head required.

1167
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:30,610
A head.

1168
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:31,310
There you go.

1169
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:32,910
Alright.

1170
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:34,250
There you go.

1171
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:36,490
Oh, my gosh.

1172
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:36,790
Okay.

1173
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:39,650
Do I take the magician first?

1174
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:40,610
Or the big guy?

1175
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:42,290
I'll do the big guy.

1176
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:45,070
Oh, shit!

1177
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:47,010
Oh, okay.

1178
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:47,770
I thought...

1179
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:48,810
Okay.

1180
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:50,290
I thought the magic would...

1181
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:51,830
Honestly...

1182
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:52,850
Okay.

1183
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:53,470
This is not good.

1184
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:54,350
This is not good.

1185
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:54,990
This is...

1186
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:55,630
Oh, my God!

1187
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:56,350
This is not good!

1188
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:57,150
I thought the

1189
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:01,470
magic...

1190
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:02,330
It's fine.

1191
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:03,910
It's fine.

1192
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:05,910
Are you serious?

1193
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:06,690
I'm...

1194
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:07,610
That's a wall!

1195
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:09,190
What the hell?

1196
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:13,530
Oh, my God!

1197
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:14,750
Oh, my God!

1198
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:17,180
I'm fine.

1199
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:17,740
What's he gonna do?

1200
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:18,400
Fall down?

1201
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,900
I know you can't fall down.

1202
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:23,380
Alright.

1203
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:25,400
It's okay.

1204
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,520
Things are fine.

1205
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:28,740
Everything's going for Doki.

1206
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:33,680
Okay.

1207
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:36,400
Okay, that's like a little cheating.

1208
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:38,260
Like, he's camping me right now.

1209
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:38,920
Is he...

1210
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,480
But you can't go down ladders.

1211
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:41,440
That's right.

1212
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:43,260
Don't have thumbs for that.

1213
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:45,300
There's no way that coach threw me.

1214
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:49,020
Okay.

1215
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:49,920
Maybe he'll hit him.

1216
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,840
Maybe he'll friendly fire his teammates.

1217
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:54,040
Okay.

1218
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:56,300
Like, how am I supposed to go up this ladder?

1219
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,480
He's just free shooting.

1220
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:04,400
Oh, my God.

1221
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,640
You're actually a whore.

1222
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:07,180
Like...

1223
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:07,460
Alright.

1224
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,100
Let's...

1225
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:09,840
Maybe I'll wait at the bottom of the ladder.

1226
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:10,520
And he'll give up.

1227
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:12,560
Maybe he'll...

1228
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,320
He'll get tired.

1229
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:13,760
You know?

1230
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:17,440
Alright.

1231
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:21,160
This time...

1232
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,040
What the fuck?

1233
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:22,740
What the...

1234
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:22,840
What?

1235
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:23,640
He just...

1236
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,040
What?

1237
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,120
You can just...

1238
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:28,380
What the fuck was that?

1239
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:29,340
Okay.

1240
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:31,620
He's like, no.

1241
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:32,700
You get down.

1242
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:33,860
Alright.

1243
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:34,840
Okay.

1244
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,920
Now we got the magic guy out here.

1245
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:37,980
Yeah.

1246
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:41,320
He'll kick me in my face.

1247
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:42,340
It's not fair.

1248
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:45,500
Okay.

1249
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:46,660
At least we know he can.

1250
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:51,180
Nice.

1251
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,200
I knew I could take him.

1252
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:54,180
I told you guys.

1253
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:54,920
I got this.

1254
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,360
I told you.

1255
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:57,280
Alright.

1256
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,300
Sanctuary stone.

1257
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:00,780
I'm stronger now.

1258
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:01,940
How do I...

1259
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:03,300
Deactivate this rock?

1260
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:06,700
What do I do?

1261
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:08,780
I don't know magic.

1262
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:09,660
Magic.

1263
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:12,740
Oh.

1264
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:13,180
Okay.

1265
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,440
Let's see.

1266
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,280
Oh, it's a deactivator.

1267
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:22,260
Oh, I already did it?

1268
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,220
Just by existing?

1269
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:25,280
I can make this jump.

1270
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:27,540
Oh, I can.

1271
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:28,120
Yay!

1272
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:31,840
Alright.

1273
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,000
Where the fuck do I go now?

1274
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:39,500
Oh, man.

1275
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:41,460
What do I...

1276
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:43,800
What do I do now?

1277
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:45,720
Teleporter?

1278
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,380
Where's the teleporter?

1279
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:48,060
Here?

1280
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:50,260
Is this one?

1281
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,580
Oh, this one.

1282
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:53,480
These arrows?

1283
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:55,740
Oh, the light.

1284
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:56,320
Oh!

1285
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,060
There was a teleporter I didn't take?

1286
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:01,900
Yeah, but I don't remember where it was.

1287
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,000
I'm like...

1288
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,060
I've been through so many areas.

1289
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:06,120
This one?

1290
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:07,060
Oh.

1291
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,400
I mean, there's a teleporter here.

1292
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,980
Go back to the...

1293
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:14,860
Oh!

1294
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:15,800
Next to me?

1295
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:19,520
Turn right.

1296
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:20,420
Is this my right?

1297
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:21,440
No, this is my right.

1298
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:24,400
No, this is my right.

1299
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:29,960
No.

1300
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:32,740
This is my right.

1301
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:38,640
Alright.

1302
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:39,720
There we go.

1303
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:41,800
That's my other right.

1304
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:43,160
I figured it out.

1305
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,460
I figured it out.

1306
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,880
Yeah, I need that break.

1307
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:47,260
I do.

1308
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,960
My brain is extra scrambled right now.

1309
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:52,980
What's this?

1310
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,220
Church of Battles.

1311
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:54,600
Ooh.

1312
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:55,460
Oh!

1313
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:56,300
Hey, look!

1314
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:57,320
Wait, can I kill him?

1315
00:49:59,040 --> 00:49:59,840
That's me!

1316
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:00,840
Oh my god!

1317
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:01,500
Pope Turtle!

1318
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:02,860
Turtle Pope!

1319
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,380
I am Muriel.

1320
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:08,540
Steward of this sacred chamber.

1321
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:10,640
Wait, how many souls does he give?

1322
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,800
The unseemly state of affairs.

1323
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:16,180
Do you know the origin of this place?

1324
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,200
How it came to be known as the Church of Vows?

1325
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:22,620
Wait, I don't know.

1326
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:23,380
What's that?

1327
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:24,060
Well, that is a shame.

1328
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:33,820
The shattering has caused us, all of us, to lose sight of something very dear.

1329
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:42,260
It is here, at the Church of Vows, that the great houses of the earth tree and the moon were joined.

1330
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:45,600
He gives spells and resets NPCs.

1331
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,200
Oh, so he's a fucking nerd!

1332
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,420
So he did all this magic bullshit.

1333
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:55,900
And so, our church holds in view the monuments of both houses.

1334
00:50:56,780 --> 00:51:01,920
The earth tree of the capital and the academy of Rhea Lucaria.

1335
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:07,680
Oh, was there something you needed?

1336
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:10,420
You are free to show yourself around.

1337
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,400
Yeah, my chest are used spells.

1338
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:15,640
I would serve as your guide, only my legs aren't what they used to be.

1339
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:20,360
If you find anything of use, you are free to take it with you.

1340
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:26,040
Unless, perhaps, you are in search of instruction, in which case, I will share...

1341
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,500
Wait, does the poke fight back?

1342
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:28,620
Why are people dying?

1343
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:30,840
Study sorcery.

1344
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,140
Oh, we don't need that.

1345
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:34,600
Those are for nerds.

1346
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:35,580
I ain't no nerd.

1347
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:38,540
You wish to know more of Lord Radigan.

1348
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,440
Lord Radigan was a great champion.

1349
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:43,120
Possessed of flow.

1350
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,920
He came to these lands at the head of a great golden host.

1351
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:53,800
When he met Lady Rinala in battle, he soon repented his territorial aggressions there.

1352
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:57,040
And became husband to the Karian Queen.

1353
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,640
Oh, good for him.

1354
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,100
Good for him for finding a maiden.

1355
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:04,300
The first Elden Lord was hounded from the lands between...

1356
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:05,580
Oh, I know Godfrey!

1357
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:06,800
That's the guy I killed!

1358
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:08,540
I killed him!

1359
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:13,560
Becoming Queen Marika's second husband and king consort.

1360
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:17,620
Taking the title of second Elden Lord.

1361
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:25,240
The mystery endures to this day as to why Lord Radigan would cast Lady Rinala aside.

1362
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:32,160
And moreover, why a mere champion would be chosen for the seat of Elden Lord.

1363
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:34,520
Oh, me?

1364
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,560
Is there anything here for me?

1365
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,200
You don't need absolution?

1366
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:41,120
What does that mean?

1367
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:45,460
Ah, fingers.

1368
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:46,780
Whose fingers is it?

1369
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,420
Gold sewing needle.

1370
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:52,560
Oh.

1371
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:53,260
Oh.

1372
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:54,860
I can be a tailor.

1373
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,540
I can fix my clothes.

1374
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:59,360
Dog ahead.

1375
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:00,760
Is that it?

1376
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,600
Praise the dog.

1377
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:05,340
Alright, let's see.

1378
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:12,370
Behold.

1379
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:20,840
Behold.

1380
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:21,760
Rump.

1381
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,580
Oh, where am I?

1382
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,040
Wait, where am I anyway?

1383
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,340
Oh, it's like a whole new area.

1384
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:29,100
Here.

1385
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:32,520
I guess I should go here and then follow this arrow.

1386
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,360
I do want to kill some sheep.

1387
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:38,800
For some extra loot.

1388
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:43,460
Alright, get over...

1389
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:45,200
Oh my god, you stupid bitch.

1390
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:47,360
That's not efficient.

1391
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:48,380
Like, where...

1392
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:49,240
See, look at that.

1393
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:50,100
That's right.

1394
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:51,520
Fucking idiot.

1395
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:52,920
You actually deserve to die.

1396
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:53,300
There.

1397
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:55,980
That's actual pure natural selection right there.

1398
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:59,140
I'm trying to make sure no other sheep is bred to like roll...

1399
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:01,100
To like bite its legs and start rolling.

1400
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:04,600
They're the easiest to catch.

1401
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:06,240
Alright.

1402
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:08,600
I guess I have to go here?

1403
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:08,820
Yeah.

1404
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,940
Look, I need those bones for arrows, guys.

1405
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:14,980
I need a craft.

1406
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:18,080
Uh...

1407
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:19,380
And I guess I'll just keep going forward.

1408
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:22,400
Don't worry.

1409
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:25,020
I'll make sure to eventually kill all the rolling sheep.

1410
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,320
So I can save their species.

1411
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:31,000
Get over here.

1412
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,220
Get over here.

1413
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:33,120
I need your bones!

1414
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:33,320
Bones!

1415
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:34,300
Nice.

1416
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:36,160
Thank you for your bones.

1417
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:41,860
Uh...

1418
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:44,460
I guess I'll just go forward until something shows up.

1419
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:49,020
And...

1420
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:49,620
Wait, is that an item?

1421
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,600
Oh, nice.

1422
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:53,580
Yay!

1423
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:54,200
Item!

1424
00:54:58,580 --> 00:54:59,300
Yay!

1425
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:00,160
Freestyle!

1426
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,620
Night required ahead?

1427
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:04,780
Oh, here?

1428
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:05,640
Okay.

1429
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,280
Yeah, I can...

1430
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:09,220
I can...

1431
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:10,360
I can wait for a night here.

1432
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:14,820
Alright.

1433
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:15,600
Uh...

1434
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:16,540
Wait, is it night time yet?

1435
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:17,580
This looks like night.

1436
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:21,600
Oh, it is night!

1437
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:22,080
Yay!

1438
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,420
Oh, that's so pretty!

1439
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:25,900
That's the Elden tree.

1440
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,160
Oh, it was night?

1441
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:29,600
Oh!

1442
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:31,300
Couldn't tell.

1443
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:32,300
Oh, wait, no.

1444
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:36,160
I couldn't tell.

1445
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,820
It's so bright for night time.

1446
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:41,500
I assume...

1447
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:41,640
I assume...

1448
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:42,140
Oh, Capo!

1449
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:43,020
Thank you for the raid!

1450
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,160
Thank you, thank you!

1451
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,320
I assume it's here, right?

1452
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:48,480
This is where I found the...

1453
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:49,980
Yeah, this is where I found it.

1454
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:51,960
Wait, night...

1455
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,000
Oh, shit!

1456
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:54,420
What the fuck?

1457
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:55,260
What the fuck?

1458
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:01,480
I was like, but night, Calvary.

1459
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:06,260
Like, I look up and then there was a fucking name tag.

1460
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:07,440
I was like, where did that...

1461
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:09,280
Where is that?

1462
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,680
Where is this guy?

1463
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:12,980
Holy fuck!

1464
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:15,760
Oh, my God.

1465
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:16,100
Okay.

1466
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:16,780
Wait.

1467
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:18,160
No, I can't summon.

1468
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:19,280
I can't summon.

1469
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:23,760
Oh, my God.

1470
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:24,520
Thank God he missed.

1471
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:28,120
Yes!

1472
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:29,240
He missed again.

1473
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:30,160
Haha, loser.

1474
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:30,700
Oh!

1475
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:32,180
You're not loser.

1476
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:32,840
Oh!

1477
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:33,780
I'm sorry!

1478
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:37,480
Oh, thank God.

1479
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:38,200
The wall.

1480
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:40,320
Okay.

1481
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:42,880
God, get closer!

1482
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:44,420
Get closer!

1483
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:48,760
I'm not pussy magic user, so I need you to get closer!

1484
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:50,280
Okay.

1485
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:50,980
What?

1486
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:52,080
That should not have hit.

1487
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:56,320
That should not have hit right there.

1488
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:57,560
Oh, my God.

1489
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:58,600
Thank God I didn't hit, too.

1490
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:00,380
Thank God he's just as bad.

1491
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:02,260
Because it's nighttime, he can't see, too.

1492
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:05,060
Oh, no.

1493
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:06,060
All right.

1494
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:07,180
No!

1495
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:08,560
I didn't know you're batting yet!

1496
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:11,460
All right.

1497
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:12,780
Nice.

1498
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:13,680
He missed again.

1499
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:15,160
Nice.

1500
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:15,960
He keeps missing.

1501
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:16,700
Ha, loser.

1502
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:18,860
Oh, fuck!

1503
00:57:26,170 --> 00:57:26,810
Okay.

1504
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:27,910
It's fine.

1505
00:57:31,870 --> 00:57:32,990
Oh, my God.

1506
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:33,510
Please.

1507
00:57:35,270 --> 00:57:35,910
What?

1508
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:38,090
Are you serious?

1509
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:39,510
He jumped!

1510
00:57:39,970 --> 00:57:40,810
He cheated!

1511
00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:46,190
He cheated!

1512
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:48,010
Jumped!

1513
00:57:51,850 --> 00:57:52,330
Okay.

1514
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:53,450
Alright.

1515
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:55,110
Is it nighttime now?

1516
00:57:55,370 --> 00:57:55,970
Oh, shit.

1517
00:57:56,130 --> 00:57:56,750
Wait, no, it's not.

1518
00:57:56,870 --> 00:57:57,290
It's morning.

1519
00:57:57,750 --> 00:58:00,390
Alright, let me grab my stuff and then I'll go back to night.

1520
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:07,960
I got too comfortable with influencer build.

1521
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:18,720
I... I got... Holy... And the people are still trying to find my messages.

1522
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:20,600
Alright, nice.

1523
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:24,340
Okay.

1524
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:29,060
Yeah, my healing flash fucking sucks right now.

1525
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:32,300
When laziness has failed me.

1526
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:34,140
No!

1527
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,280
Who's gonna enable me now?

1528
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:40,320
Okay.

1529
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:43,320
Oh, I don't have any secret tears.

1530
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:44,420
It sucks.

1531
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:46,660
It will do night.

1532
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:48,740
Iggy, welcome to the mail farm.

1533
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:49,540
Welcome, welcome.

1534
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:52,800
Alright.

1535
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:53,700
Here I go.

1536
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:55,920
Okay, where is that guy again?

1537
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:00,380
Oh, I have to find churches.

1538
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:03,080
Oh, that's what increases the healing power.

1539
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:06,500
So he should be here.

1540
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:10,680
Okay, that means that... No, I have to explore more.

1541
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:12,200
Oh, that's where he is.

1542
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:13,880
Yeah, that's right.

1543
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:14,360
I'm back.

1544
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:16,400
Bitch, that's fucking right.

1545
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:16,560
Damn it.

1546
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,280
Oh, shit.

1547
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:22,160
Oh, shit.

1548
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:22,160
Whoa.

1549
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:22,720
Nice.

1550
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:24,360
No, not nice.

1551
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:25,660
No, not nice.

1552
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,420
Wait, what the fuck?

1553
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:30,260
Oh, my God.

1554
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:32,120
Why did I have it on my dagger?

1555
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:34,940
Okay.

1556
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:39,640
God damn it.

1557
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:43,360
Oh, my rage.

1558
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:46,040
No.

1559
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:46,660
Nice.

1560
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:48,080
No, not nice.

1561
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:49,120
I can't forget he died.

1562
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,260
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1563
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:55,320
Slowly backing out.

1564
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,920
Alright, I need to figure out his pattern more.

1565
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:04,740
And like, not... Oh, not get baited.

1566
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:10,200
Come on, get back here.

1567
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:12,000
Wait, what?

1568
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:13,780
Wait, I'm right here.

1569
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:15,100
No, I'm going to get back here.

1570
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:15,440
Okay.

1571
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:16,420
Oh, my God.

1572
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:16,960
That was a bait.

1573
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,160
He's always trying to bait me.

1574
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:22,560
Where are you going?

1575
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:24,520
Hello?

1576
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:26,000
I'm right here.

1577
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:31,250
Like, what are you trying to do?

1578
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:35,290
I'm so confused.

1579
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:37,750
This movement is so confusing.

1580
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:41,630
Hello?

1581
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:44,690
Alright, nice.

1582
01:00:45,570 --> 01:00:47,550
Alright, I'll just stand here until you come back.

1583
01:00:51,490 --> 01:00:53,050
You'll eventually come back, right?

1584
01:00:55,150 --> 01:00:55,730
Damn it.

1585
01:00:56,430 --> 01:00:57,030
Oh, God!

1586
01:00:57,090 --> 01:00:58,030
I keep forgetting that attack!

1587
01:00:58,550 --> 01:01:01,370
When he does that, he does like a little charge thing.

1588
01:01:02,590 --> 01:01:03,390
God damn it.

1589
01:01:07,370 --> 01:01:07,790
No!

1590
01:01:07,990 --> 01:01:08,150
No!

1591
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:08,670
No, no, no, no!

1592
01:01:09,350 --> 01:01:10,070
Oh, my God.

1593
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:10,770
I'm...

1594
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:14,090
Come on.

1595
01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:14,630
Closer.

1596
01:01:15,230 --> 01:01:15,890
That's right.

1597
01:01:16,390 --> 01:01:16,690
What?

1598
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:17,290
Fuck this.

1599
01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:17,730
Oh!

1600
01:01:19,090 --> 01:01:19,830
Never mind.

1601
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:20,690
Never mind.

1602
01:01:20,830 --> 01:01:22,310
I won't try that again.

1603
01:01:22,630 --> 01:01:23,410
I'm sorry.

1604
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:24,410
I'm...

1605
01:01:26,670 --> 01:01:28,010
Maybe if I take high ground?

1606
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:29,170
It'd be easier.

1607
01:01:35,070 --> 01:01:35,570
God.

1608
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:36,970
He just goes in.

1609
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:38,630
He just does like a fucking...

1610
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:40,810
Drive-by and then leaves.

1611
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:42,570
Which is so annoying!

1612
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,740
God, I hate it when he does that stupid drive-by.

1613
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:56,530
All right, his horse is almost down.

1614
01:01:59,730 --> 01:02:00,610
Jesus fucking...

1615
01:02:00,610 --> 01:02:02,150
Get that horse out of here.

1616
01:02:02,430 --> 01:02:03,610
Get that fucking horse up.

1617
01:02:03,710 --> 01:02:04,050
That's right.

1618
01:02:04,230 --> 01:02:05,550
No more horse for you.

1619
01:02:05,770 --> 01:02:06,650
That's fucking right.

1620
01:02:06,870 --> 01:02:07,070
Whoa!

1621
01:02:09,570 --> 01:02:10,170
That's right.

1622
01:02:10,290 --> 01:02:11,670
You're nothing without your horse.

1623
01:02:12,850 --> 01:02:13,590
Wait, what?

1624
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:14,690
What?

1625
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:19,530
Oh my god, he just...

1626
01:02:19,530 --> 01:02:19,910
He

1627
01:02:23,390 --> 01:02:24,150
just...

1628
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:25,770
He can just do that?

1629
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:28,950
He can just like bring his horse back to life?

1630
01:02:30,590 --> 01:02:31,750
That's not fair.

1631
01:02:32,410 --> 01:02:33,510
That's not fair.

1632
01:02:34,510 --> 01:02:36,130
That's not fucking fair!

1633
01:02:37,870 --> 01:02:41,030
What do you mean he can just fucking bring a second horse?

1634
01:02:41,410 --> 01:02:42,010
That's illegal!

1635
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:46,850
Oh my god, appraise, please!

1636
01:02:46,850 --> 01:02:50,330
I've been waiting 20 years for my message, appraise!

1637
01:02:55,450 --> 01:02:56,810
Don't you...

1638
01:02:56,810 --> 01:02:58,110
Please!

1639
01:03:03,090 --> 01:03:04,490
I just need one!

1640
01:03:04,670 --> 01:03:06,270
One appraise, that's all I want!

1641
01:03:06,490 --> 01:03:07,850
Message appraise, please!

1642
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:10,010
Oh god, just one!

1643
01:03:12,690 --> 01:03:15,210
Can't play right now, sorry.

1644
01:03:18,030 --> 01:03:18,630
Please!

1645
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:21,650
My build can't work for...

1646
01:03:21,650 --> 01:03:23,730
I'm missing the one thing my build needs!

1647
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:24,350
No!

1648
01:03:24,770 --> 01:03:25,730
Please, just one!

1649
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:29,090
I beg of you, I just need one appraise!

1650
01:03:34,390 --> 01:03:34,990
Please!

1651
01:03:34,990 --> 01:03:35,170
Please!

1652
01:03:36,370 --> 01:03:37,090
Oh god.

1653
01:03:37,490 --> 01:03:38,010
Oh god.

1654
01:03:40,670 --> 01:03:41,270
Woo!

1655
01:03:41,530 --> 01:03:41,830
Woo!

1656
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:45,890
I have to play so safe right now!

1657
01:03:45,950 --> 01:03:46,610
I am...

1658
01:03:47,950 --> 01:03:48,550
Please!

1659
01:03:49,610 --> 01:03:49,770
Oh!

1660
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:54,100
I just...

1661
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:55,160
Want a breeze!

1662
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:02,060
Buddy, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

1663
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:04,300
You're nothing without your horse.

1664
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:05,320
All right, bad.

1665
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:11,380
It's not... Brian, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

1666
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:14,600
It's a good thing I always carry two horses.

1667
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:16,700
My streamer failed!

1668
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:25,020
The one thing I needed for my streamer failed is if someone actually appraised me.

1669
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:30,640
Oh god, oh god, please let me at least grab my souls before you fuck me up.

1670
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:34,500
Okay, wait, maybe...

1671
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:36,540
Maybe I can sneak one in.

1672
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:42,300
Oh, I can't, I can't... HE HAS MAGIC NOW?

1673
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:43,340
WHERE DID HE HAVE MAGIC?

1674
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:44,800
wait this is not him, this is not him.

1675
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:45,360
I'll beat him up.

1676
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:46,040
This is his brother.

1677
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:46,980
This is his brother.

1678
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:47,700
I'll beat up his brother.

1679
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:48,960
Oh shit, okay.

1680
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:50,220
I'll beat up his little brother.

1681
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:51,260
That's practice.

1682
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:55,340
That's fucking right.

1683
01:04:55,620 --> 01:04:56,360
Oh shit.

1684
01:04:56,580 --> 01:04:57,340
Okay, give me a sec.

1685
01:04:58,600 --> 01:04:59,860
That's fucking right.

1686
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:02,140
I met your older brother, bitch.

1687
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:05,100
Get out of here!

1688
01:05:14,020 --> 01:05:14,780
I'm sorry!

1689
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:16,980
Get out of here!

1690
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:18,040
I'm not sorry!

1691
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:19,400
Alright.

1692
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:20,100
Okay.

1693
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:21,120
Almost.

1694
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:22,460
That was a little scary.

1695
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:24,800
That was a little scary there.

1696
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:25,540
Alright.

1697
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:26,680
Now we go back.

1698
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:29,380
Alright.

1699
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:33,660
Where the fuck is the... It's the grace.

1700
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:34,420
Oh, it's right here.

1701
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:36,840
I lost track of where the grace is.

1702
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:38,080
I got a little cocky there.

1703
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:41,280
Alright.

1704
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:44,140
Now we rest for night time.

1705
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:45,280
Round three.

1706
01:05:51,210 --> 01:05:51,730
Alright.

1707
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:53,950
Okay.

1708
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:55,650
To make this easy, I'll put it here.

1709
01:06:01,030 --> 01:06:01,890
First up.

1710
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:02,310
Wait.

1711
01:06:02,410 --> 01:06:07,370
Is there, like, a praise in... Is there a praise in here?

1712
01:06:07,370 --> 01:06:08,650
Okay.

1713
01:06:09,050 --> 01:06:09,390
First up.

1714
01:06:10,510 --> 01:06:11,310
Actions.

1715
01:06:11,790 --> 01:06:12,510
No situation.

1716
01:06:14,810 --> 01:06:15,950
First up.

1717
01:06:16,110 --> 01:06:16,850
Appraisal.

1718
01:06:17,670 --> 01:06:18,470
Yes!

1719
01:06:18,890 --> 01:06:19,770
Where is it in?

1720
01:06:19,890 --> 01:06:20,710
Where is it in?

1721
01:06:21,810 --> 01:06:23,050
Is it in concept?

1722
01:06:24,170 --> 01:06:24,930
Clap.

1723
01:06:25,310 --> 01:06:25,870
Please.

1724
01:06:28,230 --> 01:06:29,470
First up.

1725
01:06:29,730 --> 01:06:30,710
Help me.

1726
01:06:31,370 --> 01:06:31,670
Okay.

1727
01:06:31,830 --> 01:06:32,250
Let's sit here.

1728
01:06:33,370 --> 01:06:34,430
First up.

1729
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:35,450
Help me.

1730
01:06:36,990 --> 01:06:37,670
Alright.

1731
01:06:38,050 --> 01:06:38,430
Alright.

1732
01:06:38,430 --> 01:06:38,630
There we go.

1733
01:06:38,770 --> 01:06:39,090
That works.

1734
01:06:44,050 --> 01:06:45,070
Here we go.

1735
01:06:48,090 --> 01:06:48,770
Alright.

1736
01:06:48,770 --> 01:06:49,310
I'm ready.

1737
01:06:50,170 --> 01:06:51,350
I'm ready.

1738
01:06:51,710 --> 01:06:52,630
I'm ready.

1739
01:06:53,010 --> 01:06:53,670
I'm ready.

1740
01:06:53,670 --> 01:06:53,670
Alright.

1741
01:06:53,890 --> 01:06:54,690
This time.

1742
01:06:56,330 --> 01:06:57,290
I'm ready.

1743
01:06:57,490 --> 01:06:58,130
Round three.

1744
01:06:59,770 --> 01:07:00,670
That's right.

1745
01:07:03,070 --> 01:07:03,890
Come on.

1746
01:07:04,030 --> 01:07:04,150
Yeah.

1747
01:07:04,390 --> 01:07:04,910
Sticky, right?

1748
01:07:06,610 --> 01:07:07,290
Oh!

1749
01:07:08,230 --> 01:07:08,570
Yeah!

1750
01:07:09,010 --> 01:07:09,590
First hit.

1751
01:07:09,590 --> 01:07:10,390
What?

1752
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:15,620
Oh!

1753
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:16,020
What?

1754
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:17,040
That doesn't... Oh!

1755
01:07:17,180 --> 01:07:19,680
That's... I thought that would give me, like, invincibility frames there.

1756
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:20,320
Eye frames.

1757
01:07:24,030 --> 01:07:24,970
It doesn't.

1758
01:07:27,270 --> 01:07:27,750
Oh!

1759
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:28,550
That's right.

1760
01:07:28,570 --> 01:07:29,110
Get over here.

1761
01:07:30,050 --> 01:07:30,530
Oh!

1762
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:30,870
Fuck!

1763
01:07:31,210 --> 01:07:31,750
Never mind.

1764
01:07:32,650 --> 01:07:33,750
Don't get over here.

1765
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:36,990
Okay.

1766
01:07:37,950 --> 01:07:38,430
Oh!

1767
01:07:38,530 --> 01:07:40,090
I keep forgetting that does, too.

1768
01:07:41,110 --> 01:07:42,670
That's what fucks with me the most.

1769
01:07:44,450 --> 01:07:44,890
Oh!

1770
01:07:45,170 --> 01:07:45,530
Oh!

1771
01:07:45,530 --> 01:07:45,710
Jesus!

1772
01:07:49,310 --> 01:07:49,750
Oh!

1773
01:07:50,410 --> 01:07:51,490
Have to drink one more.

1774
01:07:51,810 --> 01:07:53,150
And then he runs off.

1775
01:07:53,330 --> 01:07:54,630
He's like, give me a sec, guys.

1776
01:07:54,710 --> 01:07:56,090
I need... My horse needs to pee.

1777
01:07:57,050 --> 01:08:00,730
My horse... My horse needs a little bit of rest.

1778
01:08:03,210 --> 01:08:03,650
Okay.

1779
01:08:03,650 --> 01:08:04,870
At least... Oh!

1780
01:08:05,030 --> 01:08:05,310
What?

1781
01:08:05,390 --> 01:08:06,430
That still hits me?

1782
01:08:09,090 --> 01:08:09,530
Wait.

1783
01:08:09,610 --> 01:08:11,730
When he does... When he summons his horse, does it hurt me?

1784
01:08:14,610 --> 01:08:15,510
I'm curious.

1785
01:08:16,850 --> 01:08:17,310
I'm curious.

1786
01:08:17,310 --> 01:08:17,310
Yes?

1787
01:08:17,630 --> 01:08:17,790
Okay.

1788
01:08:18,130 --> 01:08:18,750
That's good to know.

1789
01:08:19,390 --> 01:08:21,010
Actually, I really need to know that.

1790
01:08:24,010 --> 01:08:24,530
Okay.

1791
01:08:24,710 --> 01:08:24,890
Nice.

1792
01:08:25,070 --> 01:08:25,590
That misses.

1793
01:08:27,290 --> 01:08:27,810
Alright.

1794
01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:28,650
I have one more slash.

1795
01:08:35,430 --> 01:08:35,830
Woo!

1796
01:08:37,230 --> 01:08:37,750
Woo!

1797
01:08:39,930 --> 01:08:40,450
Okay.

1798
01:08:40,610 --> 01:08:40,790
Nice.

1799
01:08:40,890 --> 01:08:41,670
That just missed me.

1800
01:08:44,170 --> 01:08:45,130
You serious?

1801
01:08:45,410 --> 01:08:46,150
Oh my...

1802
01:08:46,150 --> 01:08:46,370
God!

1803
01:08:46,570 --> 01:08:49,290
My sword just needs to be like one centimeter longer!

1804
01:08:50,490 --> 01:08:51,290
Here we go.

1805
01:08:55,370 --> 01:08:56,010
Come on.

1806
01:08:56,870 --> 01:08:57,250
No!

1807
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:00,030
Literally one hit.

1808
01:09:02,770 --> 01:09:03,090
Woo!

1809
01:09:03,390 --> 01:09:03,910
Yeah!

1810
01:09:04,410 --> 01:09:05,830
I don't need no appraisal!

1811
01:09:06,030 --> 01:09:07,070
That's looking right!

1812
01:09:07,470 --> 01:09:08,490
Pure skill!

1813
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:12,290
Oh, thank God.

1814
01:09:12,490 --> 01:09:12,690
Okay.

1815
01:09:12,830 --> 01:09:13,270
We did it.

1816
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:14,270
We did it.

1817
01:09:14,470 --> 01:09:16,010
I'll need help, guys.

1818
01:09:16,150 --> 01:09:17,250
I told you.

1819
01:09:17,490 --> 01:09:18,310
I told you.

1820
01:09:18,310 --> 01:09:21,510
I only did... I only use appraisal just for fun.

1821
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:27,470
I could do it without you.

1822
01:09:28,550 --> 01:09:29,770
I did it.

1823
01:09:30,650 --> 01:09:31,150
Yeah.

1824
01:09:33,630 --> 01:09:34,090
Yeah.

1825
01:09:35,110 --> 01:09:36,290
Let's go back.

1826
01:09:36,430 --> 01:09:38,010
I need... I need my healers.

1827
01:09:38,170 --> 01:09:39,350
I need my flash.

1828
01:09:42,110 --> 01:09:44,890
I'm a strong independent streamer!

1829
01:09:50,390 --> 01:09:50,810
Alright.

1830
01:09:51,370 --> 01:09:52,910
Now just... I guess I'll go straight.

1831
01:09:53,270 --> 01:09:54,050
More exploring.

1832
01:09:54,510 --> 01:09:55,770
Are there any churches near me?

1833
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:56,570
Chat?

1834
01:09:57,150 --> 01:09:58,470
Oh, you see those birds?

1835
01:09:58,810 --> 01:09:59,030
Wait.

1836
01:09:59,070 --> 01:10:00,470
Actually, we need to get rid of these guys first.

1837
01:10:00,910 --> 01:10:01,210
Wait.

1838
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:02,610
I should have enough to upgrade, too.

1839
01:10:04,730 --> 01:10:05,630
I should have enough.

1840
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:13,020
Alright.

1841
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:16,260
Oh, I have enough?

1842
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:16,840
Oh, I do!

1843
01:10:17,020 --> 01:10:17,340
Alright, guys.

1844
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:18,540
What do we have to focus on?

1845
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:19,620
Was it Dexterity?

1846
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:21,820
Or was it Arcane?

1847
01:10:23,860 --> 01:10:24,940
It was Arcane, right?

1848
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:26,660
Oh, thank you.

1849
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,220
Thank you for the... Wow, guys.

1850
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:28,680
Thank you.

1851
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:30,200
Thank you for the message of praise.

1852
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:32,340
I really appreciate that.

1853
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:34,120
Dexterity.

1854
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:34,460
Okay.

1855
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:37,920
Dexterity.

1856
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:38,240
Alright.

1857
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:44,960
Wow, guys.

1858
01:10:45,220 --> 01:10:45,380
See?

1859
01:10:45,820 --> 01:10:47,540
Oh, it must have been lag, right?

1860
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:49,600
Like, you just got to that part where I...

1861
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,240
Where I fought the night guy.

1862
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:55,760
Alright.

1863
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:57,240
I'm gonna kill this family of birds.

1864
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:59,560
There can only be one bird here.

1865
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:00,880
That's right.

1866
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:04,020
Tell your kids what I did!

1867
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:07,920
Oh, wait.

1868
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:08,240
Sorry.

1869
01:11:08,380 --> 01:11:09,520
I killed your only child.

1870
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:10,440
Never mind.

1871
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:11,340
That's right.

1872
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:12,580
Tell the other eagles!

1873
01:11:12,580 --> 01:11:14,180
I'll kill all your children.

1874
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:18,720
It was the stream delay, right, guys?

1875
01:11:21,340 --> 01:11:23,880
I hate how the younger brother is a magic user.

1876
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:25,180
That's right.

1877
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:27,440
Your older brother didn't need magic.

1878
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:29,700
Get over here.

1879
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:31,780
That's fucking right.

1880
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:33,060
That's right.

1881
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:34,300
You'll never beat him.

1882
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:39,540
Your older brother never needed magic to kick my ass.

1883
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:42,520
Alright.

1884
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:43,100
Nice.

1885
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:49,880
And I'll kill you.

1886
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:52,000
Because I need your bones for arrows.

1887
01:11:56,810 --> 01:11:58,270
I don't know where am I.

1888
01:11:58,690 --> 01:11:59,130
Hmm.

1889
01:12:00,110 --> 01:12:01,590
I guess I'll head straight?

1890
01:12:02,310 --> 01:12:03,430
Yeah, I'll head straight.

1891
01:12:03,690 --> 01:12:04,830
See where that takes me.

1892
01:12:05,890 --> 01:12:07,450
Let me kill these guys for fun.

1893
01:12:09,150 --> 01:12:09,810
Oh, what?

1894
01:12:09,870 --> 01:12:11,170
You're gonna blow your fucking horn?

1895
01:12:11,650 --> 01:12:12,190
Pussy?

1896
01:12:14,570 --> 01:12:15,330
That's right.

1897
01:12:15,630 --> 01:12:17,250
No horn blowing for you!

1898
01:12:18,090 --> 01:12:19,070
Oh my god.

1899
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:20,530
Who's using that?

1900
01:12:21,310 --> 01:12:21,990
Is that him?

1901
01:12:23,070 --> 01:12:24,030
Is that you?

1902
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:25,990
Oh, it was you!

1903
01:12:26,530 --> 01:12:28,350
Jeez, it took so long for you to charge.

1904
01:12:29,670 --> 01:12:29,950
Okay.

1905
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:31,610
Let me get rid of all the little guys first.

1906
01:12:31,850 --> 01:12:32,130
Oh!

1907
01:12:32,290 --> 01:12:33,390
I sent the little guys!

1908
01:12:33,690 --> 01:12:34,790
I'll kick you on later!

1909
01:12:37,210 --> 01:12:37,610
Oh, wait.

1910
01:12:37,690 --> 01:12:39,250
That guy's pretty big.

1911
01:12:40,770 --> 01:12:41,050
Wait.

1912
01:12:41,150 --> 01:12:41,230
No.

1913
01:12:41,350 --> 01:12:41,410
No.

1914
01:12:41,550 --> 01:12:41,590
No.

1915
01:12:41,650 --> 01:12:41,790
No.

1916
01:12:41,830 --> 01:12:41,950
No.

1917
01:12:41,950 --> 01:12:42,050
No.

1918
01:12:42,050 --> 01:12:42,110
No.

1919
01:12:42,130 --> 01:12:42,190
No.

1920
01:12:42,250 --> 01:12:42,310
No.

1921
01:12:42,310 --> 01:12:42,370
No.

1922
01:12:42,370 --> 01:12:42,430
No.

1923
01:12:44,650 --> 01:12:45,190
All right.

1924
01:12:45,390 --> 01:12:45,890
You know what to do.

1925
01:12:46,530 --> 01:12:47,450
You know what to do.

1926
01:12:47,790 --> 01:12:48,610
Take care of this guy.

1927
01:12:49,230 --> 01:12:50,430
I sent this guy!

1928
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:56,630
I need to get rid of the small guy first.

1929
01:12:57,490 --> 01:12:57,610
Okay.

1930
01:12:57,770 --> 01:12:58,450
Jellyfish, please.

1931
01:12:58,930 --> 01:12:59,330
Jellyfish.

1932
01:12:59,410 --> 01:12:59,690
Yes!

1933
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:00,890
Aggro him!

1934
01:13:01,030 --> 01:13:01,450
Yes!

1935
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:02,730
Do your thing!

1936
01:13:04,190 --> 01:13:05,730
And I'll do my thing, too.

1937
01:13:05,970 --> 01:13:06,250
Watch.

1938
01:13:06,830 --> 01:13:07,610
Ha-ha!

1939
01:13:09,290 --> 01:13:11,910
Shit, I've got distracted, buddy!

1940
01:13:12,310 --> 01:13:13,430
That's fucking right!

1941
01:13:13,710 --> 01:13:14,150
Oh, shit.

1942
01:13:15,870 --> 01:13:16,250
All right.

1943
01:13:17,170 --> 01:13:17,410
All right.

1944
01:13:17,490 --> 01:13:18,290
Do your thing, Jellyfish.

1945
01:13:18,330 --> 01:13:18,850
Do your thing.

1946
01:13:19,430 --> 01:13:20,330
Aggro him, buddy.

1947
01:13:20,630 --> 01:13:21,330
Come on, buddy!

1948
01:13:21,510 --> 01:13:22,210
Aggro him!

1949
01:13:22,290 --> 01:13:22,910
You got this!

1950
01:13:23,010 --> 01:13:23,390
Yeah!

1951
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:24,570
Ha-ha!

1952
01:13:24,710 --> 01:13:26,530
You got distracted again!

1953
01:13:27,810 --> 01:13:28,770
That's right!

1954
01:13:30,350 --> 01:13:32,010
Get out of here!

1955
01:13:32,890 --> 01:13:33,830
Give me your shit.

1956
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:36,310
Get out of here!

1957
01:13:39,570 --> 01:13:40,750
That's fucking right!

1958
01:13:42,150 --> 01:13:43,270
Get backshot!

1959
01:13:44,190 --> 01:13:46,050
Had lots of practice earlier!

1960
01:13:52,740 --> 01:13:53,300
Uh...

1961
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:54,160
Let's trade, then.

1962
01:13:55,540 --> 01:13:56,300
That's right!

1963
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:58,020
I had a lot of practice on those hunters.

1964
01:13:58,520 --> 01:13:59,120
In Halo.

1965
01:13:59,580 --> 01:14:01,160
I'm really good at it now.

1966
01:14:02,380 --> 01:14:03,600
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

1967
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:05,240
What do you mean?

1968
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:07,460
I had so much practice yesterday, guys!

1969
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:09,580
All I did was...

1970
01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:11,820
Was doing my deadly backshots.

1971
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:12,760
Left and right.

1972
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:18,620
All right.

1973
01:14:21,220 --> 01:14:22,200
Get out of here.

1974
01:14:24,380 --> 01:14:25,140
Ooh!

1975
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:28,040
Sniper ahead?

1976
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:29,220
Wait, where?

1977
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:30,340
Here?

1978
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:32,600
Might be here.

1979
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:35,300
Where would the sniper be?

1980
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:35,740
AHH!

1981
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:39,900
Guys, it was over there.

1982
01:14:40,580 --> 01:14:41,060
Guys.

1983
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:43,720
I think I know where the sniper is, guys.

1984
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:45,200
I think...

1985
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:47,660
I think I found the sniper, Chad.

1986
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:48,440
I...

1987
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:50,200
I think I found him.

1988
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:52,280
All right.

1989
01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:53,680
How do we get to the sniper?

1990
01:14:58,740 --> 01:14:59,420
Oh, hey.

1991
01:14:59,580 --> 01:14:59,920
Free stuff.

1992
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:01,900
How do we get there?

1993
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:05,660
Oh, it's from here.

1994
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:07,540
Oh, there's multiple.

1995
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:08,460
Oh, okay.

1996
01:15:08,580 --> 01:15:09,160
It's guarded.

1997
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:09,660
Okay.

1998
01:15:12,660 --> 01:15:13,140
Um...

1999
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:14,740
Hmm...

2000
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:16,280
Hmm...

2001
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:16,700
Hmm...

2002
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:17,320
Uh...

2003
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:19,100
I'm broken by.

2004
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:20,360
Thank you, this super chat.

2005
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:20,980
Thank you, thank you.

2006
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:22,100
Wait, how do I...

2007
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:25,280
How do I get to there safely?

2008
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:27,360
It's like here?

2009
01:15:27,540 --> 01:15:27,980
Oh, here.

2010
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:30,040
Oh, wait.

2011
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:30,540
What?

2012
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:34,080
How do I hit that?

2013
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:38,640
How the fuck do I hit that?

2014
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:40,040
It's like attached to the wall.

2015
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:42,600
Wait, this is more important.

2016
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:43,220
It's loot.

2017
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:46,820
God damn it.

2018
01:15:46,940 --> 01:15:47,940
Okay, I can...

2019
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:51,340
I don't have arrows still.

2020
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:51,960
Wait, do I?

2021
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:53,840
Wait, I might be able to craft arrows now.

2022
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:56,300
Oh, I can.

2023
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:56,880
Nice.

2024
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:58,100
All right.

2025
01:15:58,440 --> 01:15:58,940
I just have...

2026
01:15:58,940 --> 01:16:00,320
I just had enough arrows.

2027
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:02,240
Okay.

2028
01:16:03,620 --> 01:16:04,820
Okay, I'm gonna go up here.

2029
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:07,660
I'm gonna go up here.

2030
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:14,800
And then...

2031
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:15,140
No!

2032
01:16:15,540 --> 01:16:15,920
No!

2033
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:16,440
No!

2034
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:18,320
Fine, I didn't want to be up here anyway.

2035
01:16:21,380 --> 01:16:22,980
Did I craft the wrong arrows?

2036
01:16:30,190 --> 01:16:30,850
Wait, what?

2037
01:16:35,030 --> 01:16:35,510
Wait.

2038
01:16:36,650 --> 01:16:37,130
No.

2039
01:16:37,930 --> 01:16:38,930
There's no way.

2040
01:16:39,670 --> 01:16:40,750
Oh, there it is.

2041
01:16:40,890 --> 01:16:42,670
I was gonna be like, there's no way I...

2042
01:16:42,670 --> 01:16:44,690
I crafted the wrong arrow.

2043
01:16:44,810 --> 01:16:45,590
I'll be so sad.

2044
01:16:46,110 --> 01:16:47,270
All right, how do I use this again?

2045
01:16:48,210 --> 01:16:49,990
Okay, I'm trying to remember how to use my arrows.

2046
01:16:53,350 --> 01:16:54,110
Okay, nice.

2047
01:16:56,490 --> 01:16:57,330
And then...

2048
01:16:57,850 --> 01:16:58,630
There we go.

2049
01:16:59,370 --> 01:16:59,530
Yeah!

2050
01:17:00,050 --> 01:17:00,530
What did I get?

2051
01:17:05,060 --> 01:17:06,140
What the fuck did I get?

2052
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:08,620
What was that?

2053
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:10,760
What the fuck?

2054
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:13,460
Oh, I got...

2055
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:14,640
Oh, I got an Estes!

2056
01:17:14,940 --> 01:17:15,280
Oh!

2057
01:17:16,660 --> 01:17:18,860
Oh, so that was a waste of my arrows.

2058
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:19,820
What the fuck?

2059
01:17:19,820 --> 01:17:21,340
It was just healing.

2060
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:22,940
Oh my god, that was a waste.

2061
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:24,480
Okay.

2062
01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:30,840
I need to know, like, distinguish between this...

2063
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:32,320
The two fucking...

2064
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:32,900
Oh, sorry.

2065
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:33,840
The three bugs.

2066
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:39,100
Oh god.

2067
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:39,620
Okay, wait.

2068
01:17:39,940 --> 01:17:40,900
Oh, I can't use it.

2069
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:41,340
Oh!

2070
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:44,920
Whoa!

2071
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:47,520
Oh, what?

2072
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:48,580
No, I'm trapped!

2073
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:49,040
I'm trapped!

2074
01:17:49,180 --> 01:17:49,480
I'm trapped!

2075
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:50,140
Oh!

2076
01:17:56,410 --> 01:17:57,530
There was a wall!

2077
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:05,880
Oh, shit.

2078
01:18:06,860 --> 01:18:07,620
Oh, shit.

2079
01:18:07,820 --> 01:18:08,660
I didn't dodge that.

2080
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:09,720
Oh.

2081
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:11,600
Oh!

2082
01:18:12,340 --> 01:18:13,980
I don't know your pattern, sir!

2083
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:16,460
I cheated to kill you, your first brother!

2084
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:24,360
I didn't bother to learn!

2085
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:25,760
Oh, no!

2086
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:30,300
I didn't bother to learn!

2087
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:31,860
No!

2088
01:18:35,980 --> 01:18:36,700
Okay.

2089
01:18:37,260 --> 01:18:38,180
I know how to...

2090
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:39,140
I know how to...

2091
01:18:39,140 --> 01:18:39,260
Wait.

2092
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:40,780
I guess the...

2093
01:18:40,780 --> 01:18:42,320
Steak would be closer, right?

2094
01:18:42,740 --> 01:18:43,920
It should be.

2095
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:44,880
Technically.

2096
01:18:47,780 --> 01:18:50,780
I have the jellyfish help me!

2097
01:18:55,860 --> 01:18:56,700
Oh god.

2098
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:57,500
Not again.

2099
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:00,460
Okay.

2100
01:19:01,220 --> 01:19:03,240
Okay, now I have the jellyfish again.

2101
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:04,360
Dad, thank you.

2102
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:05,680
Welcome to Tomato Fire.

2103
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:06,620
Welcome, welcome.

2104
01:19:10,570 --> 01:19:11,150
Okay.

2105
01:19:12,370 --> 01:19:12,870
Oh.

2106
01:19:15,270 --> 01:19:16,350
Alright, there we go.

2107
01:19:18,150 --> 01:19:19,150
Where is it?

2108
01:19:19,770 --> 01:19:20,450
Here we go.

2109
01:19:21,070 --> 01:19:22,110
Okay, I'm just gonna leave.

2110
01:19:22,810 --> 01:19:25,130
I don't think it's important in any way to fight him.

2111
01:19:26,350 --> 01:19:27,350
Alright, I'll just go here.

2112
01:19:27,470 --> 01:19:28,530
The big scary temple.

2113
01:19:29,610 --> 01:19:31,730
Yeah, I'm just gonna go to the big scary temple.

2114
01:19:33,070 --> 01:19:35,350
I don't think he was that important in any way.

2115
01:19:40,460 --> 01:19:41,660
Alright, up I go!

2116
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:44,540
Big scary temple time!

2117
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:45,940
Oh, what's this?

2118
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:49,920
Oh, nice.

2119
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:50,920
Got some grease.

2120
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:55,660
Oh, nice.

2121
01:19:55,820 --> 01:19:56,660
There's another grease here.

2122
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:57,240
That's good.

2123
01:19:57,740 --> 01:19:58,620
We actually needed that.

2124
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:05,200
Grace restored.

2125
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,020
Alright, El Faco.

2126
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:13,180
Hello?

2127
01:20:13,540 --> 01:20:14,840
Is anybody here?

2128
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:17,660
Grand life of Dectus?

2129
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:18,640
Hello?

2130
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:21,040
Hello?

2131
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:21,660
Anyone alive?

2132
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:23,540
Is anyone alive?

2133
01:20:27,770 --> 01:20:28,350
Anyone?

2134
01:20:29,850 --> 01:20:30,930
There's an elevator?

2135
01:20:32,470 --> 01:20:33,950
Where's that elevator be?

2136
01:20:34,270 --> 01:20:34,590
Oh, wait.

2137
01:20:34,670 --> 01:20:35,430
There's a person here.

2138
01:20:39,610 --> 01:20:40,630
Hey there, buddy.

2139
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:48,120
Where's what?

2140
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:55,840
Oh, I don't have to write.

2141
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:57,260
Oh, I need a key item.

2142
01:20:57,560 --> 01:20:57,740
Oh!

2143
01:20:58,540 --> 01:21:00,000
I'm not worthy enough.

2144
01:21:05,420 --> 01:21:06,440
I see.

2145
01:21:09,970 --> 01:21:11,830
I'm not good enough for her.

2146
01:21:13,550 --> 01:21:14,910
Alright, so...

2147
01:21:14,910 --> 01:21:17,670
Since I can't go there yet...

2148
01:21:19,070 --> 01:21:20,430
Grand line...

2149
01:21:20,430 --> 01:21:20,850
I mean...

2150
01:21:20,850 --> 01:21:21,590
What's over here?

2151
01:21:22,090 --> 01:21:23,330
Wait, why is that red?

2152
01:21:24,470 --> 01:21:26,050
What is over here?

2153
01:21:27,630 --> 01:21:29,430
There's something red over there.

2154
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:33,560
Ooh.

2155
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:35,740
Try target lock?

2156
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:37,880
Ooh.

2157
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:39,880
What is that?

2158
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:44,200
Well, it's just some bats.

2159
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:45,520
There's nothing to be afraid of.

2160
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:52,720
There's nothing to be afraid of down here.

2161
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:54,740
Just some little bats.

2162
01:21:57,060 --> 01:21:58,020
Yeah, see?

2163
01:21:58,540 --> 01:21:59,400
Try this guy.

2164
01:22:01,020 --> 01:22:02,600
Just some little bats.

2165
01:22:03,140 --> 01:22:04,640
I think he's so cool.

2166
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:06,300
Get over here.

2167
01:22:07,540 --> 01:22:08,200
Oh my god, please.

2168
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:08,940
Please, you're...

2169
01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:09,320
No!

2170
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:10,460
Do not roll out!

2171
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:11,500
That's right.

2172
01:22:12,580 --> 01:22:13,260
Oh, nice.

2173
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:13,940
I needed that, too.

2174
01:22:14,260 --> 01:22:16,100
I actually need that for a sword upgrade.

2175
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:17,920
Okay.

2176
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:20,840
Oh my god, these guys died to bats?

2177
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:21,840
Oh my god.

2178
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:24,240
How bad are you?

2179
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:26,200
There's not that many bats.

2180
01:22:26,340 --> 01:22:26,780
Come on.

2181
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:29,100
How could you die to these little guys?

2182
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:29,880
Look at them.

2183
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:31,020
They're so weak.

2184
01:22:31,660 --> 01:22:32,760
Look at them.

2185
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:37,200
How could you guys die to that?

2186
01:22:37,420 --> 01:22:38,540
Oh no, they didn't.

2187
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:43,060
What the?

2188
01:22:43,420 --> 01:22:44,000
Do a flip.

2189
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:47,160
Where are they trying to go?

2190
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:50,680
And then likely light.

2191
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:52,460
Oh!

2192
01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:54,160
Oh!

2193
01:22:56,140 --> 01:22:56,500
Oh!

2194
01:22:58,200 --> 01:22:59,300
Hmm.

2195
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:04,400
Hmm.

2196
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:10,660
I don't know about that.

2197
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:11,940
I don't know.

2198
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,140
I want to try.

2199
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:18,940
Guys, I don't think they died to bats.

2200
01:23:19,180 --> 01:23:23,180
They may or may not have died to something known as gravity.

2201
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:39,040
That's gonna be me.

2202
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:41,360
Oh my god.

2203
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:43,120
That's gonna be me!

2204
01:23:43,380 --> 01:23:44,800
I can feel it!

2205
01:23:48,380 --> 01:23:50,660
Guys, it can still be bats, guys.

2206
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:55,500
Okay, maybe I'll look at this guy and see.

2207
01:23:55,980 --> 01:23:58,400
Okay, what the fuck did this guy do?

2208
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:00,880
Oh.

2209
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:04,100
Oh, he missed.

2210
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:05,140
Okay.

2211
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:06,800
I don't know.

2212
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:11,240
I feel like... I feel like it might not be worse than it.

2213
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:12,740
Chat, I don't know.

2214
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,820
Oh, but it goes through the black hole.

2215
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:21,800
There was just a lot of bats down there, Doki.

2216
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:25,300
I don't know.

2217
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:28,000
Feels like...

2218
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,620
Feels a little dangerous.

2219
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:32,720
Okay, it's worth it.

2220
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:34,260
Okay, what do I get out of it?

2221
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:34,960
Tell me.

2222
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:39,120
What do I get out of it if I try to go down to the bat hole?

2223
01:24:41,460 --> 01:24:42,300
You're different?

2224
01:24:42,620 --> 01:24:44,440
Alright, I have 6,000... Okay.

2225
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:48,460
When I get rid of, like, my runes, I'll try.

2226
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:49,360
I'll try it.

2227
01:24:57,510 --> 01:25:01,990
I'll try it when I get out of my... When I upgrade my runes.

2228
01:25:04,190 --> 01:25:05,090
Let's see.

2229
01:25:06,790 --> 01:25:07,830
Alright, go then.

2230
01:25:08,070 --> 01:25:09,010
I guess I'll go this way.

2231
01:25:10,430 --> 01:25:11,790
There's nowhere else to go.

2232
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:17,440
Uh, Zapko!

2233
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:18,300
Thank you for the super chat!

2234
01:25:18,380 --> 01:25:19,020
Thank you, thank you!

2235
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:20,280
If you learn to save quick...

2236
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:24,380
Save quick fast enough, you never have to worry about gravity!

2237
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:31,540
Guys, I'm really struggling right now to walk.

2238
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:33,840
I don't think I can save quick fast enough.

2239
01:25:35,780 --> 01:25:36,360
What's that?

2240
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:39,320
What's that sound?

2241
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:44,080
Oh, hey, is that coming towards me?

2242
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:45,680
Oh!

2243
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:47,120
It

2244
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:51,580
was like, fuck you!

2245
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:52,420
Damn!

2246
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:53,540
Oh, shit!

2247
01:25:53,820 --> 01:25:55,800
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

2248
01:26:02,420 --> 01:26:02,900
no!

2249
01:26:03,540 --> 01:26:03,980
Okay.

2250
01:26:04,820 --> 01:26:05,920
So, that was madness.

2251
01:26:07,020 --> 01:26:07,900
That was...

2252
01:26:08,340 --> 01:26:12,960
You know, like, you're, you know, things like how you're not supposed to look at...

2253
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:17,520
You're not supposed to look at the, at the sun during a solar eclipse.

2254
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:17,520
Oops.

2255
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:20,740
I didn't know... that's me right there.

2256
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:34,140
I'm the guy that looked... I'm... I'm the people that looked up directly into the... into the solar eclipse.

2257
01:26:36,820 --> 01:26:37,340
Okay.

2258
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,720
Uh... Can I even go up here?

2259
01:26:40,940 --> 01:26:42,220
Or like, am I fucked?

2260
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:48,920
Just close your eyes!

2261
01:26:57,080 --> 01:26:58,400
How the fuck do I...?

2262
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:02,280
Oh, wait, I just stay out of sight?

2263
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,140
It's like here, right?

2264
01:27:06,860 --> 01:27:08,340
Oh, I think he got crazy.

2265
01:27:12,210 --> 01:27:13,910
Let's kill this big rat first.

2266
01:27:14,250 --> 01:27:14,530
Alright.

2267
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:18,780
Oh, hey.

2268
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:21,140
Okay, I'll go this way.

2269
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:28,700
Alright, and then... Where do I go from here?

2270
01:27:30,900 --> 01:27:31,720
Oh, wait, no.

2271
01:27:31,820 --> 01:27:33,220
I'm still getting... Oh, no.

2272
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:34,100
Oh, no.

2273
01:27:34,440 --> 01:27:34,760
Oh, no.

2274
01:27:34,860 --> 01:27:35,300
Okay, right here.

2275
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:37,100
That's the spot.

2276
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:43,540
Yeah, just wait behind this tree.

2277
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:46,680
I don't think he saw me.

2278
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:48,380
Okay, the rat saw me.

2279
01:27:49,020 --> 01:27:52,520
The rat... Guys, the rat... What?!

2280
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:53,580
What?!

2281
01:27:53,580 --> 01:27:54,440
No way!

2282
01:27:54,720 --> 01:27:55,180
No!

2283
01:27:55,180 --> 01:27:55,660
No way!

2284
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:58,040
Are you fucking dead to a rat?!

2285
01:27:58,040 --> 01:27:58,960
No way!

2286
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:02,100
Are you fucking dead to a rat?!

2287
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:06,240
Oh... Stupid fucking ass!

2288
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:09,180
Oh my god!

2289
01:28:13,710 --> 01:28:15,850
Okay, we gotta get my souls back.

2290
01:28:16,590 --> 01:28:17,210
Great.

2291
01:28:17,550 --> 01:28:19,410
The rat madness got me, guys.

2292
01:28:24,860 --> 01:28:26,740
Still no precious items.

2293
01:28:27,020 --> 01:28:28,140
Still no lover.

2294
01:28:28,620 --> 01:28:29,840
It feels bad, man.

2295
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:31,560
That's rough, buddy.

2296
01:28:32,940 --> 01:28:33,380
Okay.

2297
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:34,380
Okay, now I know what to do.

2298
01:28:36,380 --> 01:28:37,880
Stupid rat that I use.

2299
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:38,420
Quick attack.

2300
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:42,360
Okay.

2301
01:28:46,310 --> 01:28:47,810
Alright, I can grab my item bath.

2302
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:53,080
I go this way.

2303
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:57,460
And then... Go this way.

2304
01:28:58,300 --> 01:28:58,960
And then... Go this way.

2305
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:02,840
And then... This is not in view, right?

2306
01:29:03,020 --> 01:29:03,600
Yeah, right here.

2307
01:29:04,540 --> 01:29:05,520
Oh, then ring requires.

2308
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:06,320
Require it ahead.

2309
01:29:06,620 --> 01:29:07,140
And then seek.

2310
01:29:07,380 --> 01:29:08,640
Wait, I don't have the elder ring.

2311
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:12,200
Get right on.

2312
01:29:12,860 --> 01:29:14,260
Zeon, thank you for the super chat.

2313
01:29:14,420 --> 01:29:14,680
Thank you.

2314
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:15,320
Thank you.

2315
01:29:15,460 --> 01:29:16,700
Wait, where do I get the elder ring?

2316
01:29:17,300 --> 01:29:18,120
Just got here.

2317
01:29:23,930 --> 01:29:24,410
Okay.

2318
01:29:24,410 --> 01:29:25,790
Okay, now I should be safe.

2319
01:29:26,490 --> 01:29:27,270
Thank god.

2320
01:29:27,270 --> 01:29:28,250
I'm safe now.

2321
01:29:29,910 --> 01:29:30,450
What's this?

2322
01:29:32,690 --> 01:29:33,770
First off, left?

2323
01:29:34,150 --> 01:29:34,890
I mean this guy?

2324
01:29:34,890 --> 01:29:34,890
What?

2325
01:29:38,230 --> 01:29:40,830
Oh, can I kill the guy that does the madness stuff?

2326
01:29:44,710 --> 01:29:46,230
Likely dark lord.

2327
01:29:47,470 --> 01:29:48,810
Can't be that bad, right?

2328
01:29:49,530 --> 01:29:49,950
Oh!

2329
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:00,100
Okay, I can't do anything yet.

2330
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:02,960
I have to wait.

2331
01:30:04,460 --> 01:30:05,260
Give me a sec.

2332
01:30:05,380 --> 01:30:05,960
I gotta wait.

2333
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:08,800
Alright.

2334
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:16,720
I can't do!

2335
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:20,680
Oh my god, he's guarded by all these rats!

2336
01:30:22,940 --> 01:30:25,060
Holy shit, that's a big-ass rat!

2337
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:26,160
It's not fair!

2338
01:30:26,420 --> 01:30:29,690
He has so many rats!

2339
01:30:29,850 --> 01:30:31,150
It's all rats!

2340
01:30:37,340 --> 01:30:40,560
Oh my god, it's just all rats!

2341
01:30:40,660 --> 01:30:41,240
Oh, thank you.

2342
01:30:41,380 --> 01:30:42,100
Missed such a phrase.

2343
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:42,680
Thank you.

2344
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:44,640
I can't.

2345
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:48,260
I really appreciate it.

2346
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:49,340
Oh man.

2347
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:50,460
Thank you guys.

2348
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:50,840
I know.

2349
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:52,420
It was a really good message.

2350
01:30:52,940 --> 01:30:54,400
It was...

2351
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:57,220
It was a really, really good message.

2352
01:30:57,700 --> 01:30:59,340
How many rats?

2353
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:01,820
Oh my god.

2354
01:31:01,940 --> 01:31:02,980
It was just rats.

2355
01:31:03,260 --> 01:31:05,100
It was only rats.

2356
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:09,020
Okay, I figured it out though.

2357
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:11,900
I figured it out.

2358
01:31:12,100 --> 01:31:13,620
I know what to do this time.

2359
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:15,940
And we go this way.

2360
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:18,240
And then we go this way.

2361
01:31:20,120 --> 01:31:21,280
And then...

2362
01:31:22,360 --> 01:31:23,520
We go here.

2363
01:31:26,180 --> 01:31:28,000
We hide here in this corner.

2364
01:31:28,620 --> 01:31:30,020
And we should be okay.

2365
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:33,620
And then...

2366
01:31:33,620 --> 01:31:35,140
And then we go this way.

2367
01:31:36,340 --> 01:31:38,780
I'm gonna hug the wall so it can't get me.

2368
01:31:39,460 --> 01:31:40,360
And then...

2369
01:31:40,360 --> 01:31:41,700
And then...

2370
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:44,280
And then...

2371
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:45,020
And then we got this.

2372
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:47,080
We gotta let this cool down.

2373
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:49,600
Before I go up there again.

2374
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:53,240
Wait, materials?

2375
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:54,520
What materials is this?

2376
01:31:55,320 --> 01:31:56,120
Yellow ember.

2377
01:31:56,300 --> 01:31:57,740
Okay, I gotta get my shit back though.

2378
01:32:05,860 --> 01:32:07,320
Oh my god, please.

2379
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:09,460
Oh my god, please.

2380
01:32:09,820 --> 01:32:10,920
Oh my god.

2381
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:13,340
Please, I'm trying...

2382
01:32:13,340 --> 01:32:14,520
Oh, no!

2383
01:32:28,310 --> 01:32:29,530
Oh my god.

2384
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:34,560
I'm trying to like...

2385
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:35,980
It won't let me down.

2386
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:41,060
But it kept trying to...

2387
01:32:41,060 --> 01:32:42,740
It kept like...

2388
01:32:42,740 --> 01:32:43,680
Jumping instead.

2389
01:32:48,150 --> 01:32:49,390
Oh my god.

2390
01:32:49,490 --> 01:32:51,110
I was trying to get off my horse.

2391
01:32:51,230 --> 01:32:54,270
But I was also trying to dodge the rats at the same time.

2392
01:32:54,710 --> 01:32:56,970
So then my horse, instead of getting off...

2393
01:32:56,970 --> 01:32:58,250
It starts jumping around.

2394
01:32:58,470 --> 01:33:01,310
Because I've been trying to get away from the rats.

2395
01:33:01,310 --> 01:33:03,850
I was locked in the room.

2396
01:33:03,890 --> 01:33:05,110
Filled with rats.

2397
01:33:05,310 --> 01:33:06,470
What do I do?

2398
01:33:08,030 --> 01:33:09,930
I can't believe it.

2399
01:33:11,550 --> 01:33:14,170
Most of my deaths this run...

2400
01:33:14,170 --> 01:33:16,450
Is just from the rats alone.

2401
01:33:17,010 --> 01:33:18,370
It's not a boss fight.

2402
01:33:18,570 --> 01:33:20,450
It's literally just the rats.

2403
01:33:20,870 --> 01:33:22,170
The fucking rats.

2404
01:33:24,490 --> 01:33:26,550
The fucking rats.

2405
01:33:29,730 --> 01:33:30,530
Okay.

2406
01:33:32,670 --> 01:33:33,950
I'll cool down.

2407
01:33:34,650 --> 01:33:36,250
A rat fight.

2408
01:33:36,670 --> 01:33:37,410
Oh shit.

2409
01:33:37,590 --> 01:33:38,290
Oh shit.

2410
01:33:38,730 --> 01:33:41,150
My toe is peeking out of that wall.

2411
01:33:49,260 --> 01:33:50,060
Alright.

2412
01:33:55,620 --> 01:33:56,480
Yo, yo.

2413
01:33:57,800 --> 01:33:59,200
We just wait.

2414
01:34:04,910 --> 01:34:05,710
Alright.

2415
01:34:07,290 --> 01:34:08,410
Oh my god.

2416
01:34:08,550 --> 01:34:09,770
They're actually guarding my...

2417
01:34:11,470 --> 01:34:12,570
Oh my god.

2418
01:34:13,470 --> 01:34:14,270
Oh!

2419
01:34:14,270 --> 01:34:15,250
Oh my god.

2420
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:16,650
The stupid rats!

2421
01:34:21,410 --> 01:34:22,050
No!

2422
01:34:26,020 --> 01:34:26,760
It's fine.

2423
01:34:27,220 --> 01:34:27,780
It's fine.

2424
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:30,040
Oh my god.

2425
01:34:30,180 --> 01:34:30,760
It's not fine.

2426
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:32,820
It's not fine.

2427
01:34:33,480 --> 01:34:34,940
He's such a big rat.

2428
01:34:35,740 --> 01:34:37,260
He's such a big boy.

2429
01:34:38,120 --> 01:34:38,560
Alright.

2430
01:34:38,660 --> 01:34:39,060
There we go.

2431
01:34:39,820 --> 01:34:40,300
It's okay.

2432
01:34:40,580 --> 01:34:41,300
It's okay.

2433
01:34:41,540 --> 01:34:42,380
We're okay.

2434
01:34:42,940 --> 01:34:44,080
Madness ahead.

2435
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:45,220
Oh yeah, yeah.

2436
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:48,000
Whoa, really?

2437
01:34:48,700 --> 01:34:49,000
Wow.

2438
01:34:51,420 --> 01:34:52,180
Alright.

2439
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:54,500
Who is this fucker?

2440
01:34:55,880 --> 01:34:57,720
That's ruining my day.

2441
01:34:58,120 --> 01:35:00,480
And inviting all these goddamn rats.

2442
01:35:00,940 --> 01:35:02,100
Who is it?

2443
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:04,020
Who are you?

2444
01:35:08,830 --> 01:35:10,230
Oh, I see you.

2445
01:35:11,010 --> 01:35:12,090
It was you?

2446
01:35:17,610 --> 01:35:19,690
Oh, oh, I got hit by madness.

2447
01:35:19,690 --> 01:35:21,550
Okay, I'm just climbing a ladder.

2448
01:35:24,810 --> 01:35:26,850
I climbed a ladder and got hit.

2449
01:35:27,270 --> 01:35:27,950
Alright, okay.

2450
01:35:28,110 --> 01:35:28,790
No, no, that's fair.

2451
01:35:28,910 --> 01:35:29,190
That's fair.

2452
01:35:29,290 --> 01:35:29,550
That's fair.

2453
01:35:29,630 --> 01:35:30,670
Let me, let me stay down here.

2454
01:35:30,790 --> 01:35:31,850
Let me just open your chest.

2455
01:35:33,650 --> 01:35:34,310
That's fine.

2456
01:35:34,550 --> 01:35:34,990
That's fine.

2457
01:35:35,090 --> 01:35:36,370
I'll just, I'll just stay down here.

2458
01:35:41,070 --> 01:35:43,230
All right, I can wait.

2459
01:35:53,010 --> 01:35:53,410
Okay.

2460
01:35:54,930 --> 01:35:55,330
Yeah.

2461
01:35:55,330 --> 01:35:55,410
There we go.

2462
01:35:56,430 --> 01:35:57,850
And then I just start swinging.

2463
01:36:02,160 --> 01:36:02,960
Oh my God.

2464
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:03,680
That's fine.

2465
01:36:04,060 --> 01:36:04,700
That's fine.

2466
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:05,960
That's not fine.

2467
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:06,600
That's not fine.

2468
01:36:06,740 --> 01:36:07,180
That's not fine.

2469
01:36:07,340 --> 01:36:08,800
How many are you?

2470
01:36:10,420 --> 01:36:12,060
How are you still praying?

2471
01:36:12,780 --> 01:36:13,740
Okay, there we go.

2472
01:36:13,860 --> 01:36:14,380
They're all dead.

2473
01:36:14,580 --> 01:36:15,000
Thank God.

2474
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:17,780
No madness ahead.

2475
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:20,020
We did it.

2476
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:22,440
We cure the world of madness.

2477
01:36:23,460 --> 01:36:25,780
Don't need therapy anymore, guys.

2478
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:26,720
We did it.

2479
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:28,820
No more therapy.

2480
01:36:32,780 --> 01:36:34,660
We fucking did it, guys.

2481
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:36,980
Flush away those meds.

2482
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:38,100
But like, in-game.

2483
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:38,980
In-game, guys.

2484
01:36:39,140 --> 01:36:39,480
In-game.

2485
01:36:39,740 --> 01:36:43,580
I cured Elden Ring mental illness.

2486
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:44,740
That's different.

2487
01:36:45,160 --> 01:36:45,820
I swear to God.

2488
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:47,760
I swear to God, if I die to fucking dogs, I swear to God.

2489
01:36:50,700 --> 01:36:51,500
Depression eliminated.

2490
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:54,920
Oh, it's over here.

2491
01:36:56,280 --> 01:36:56,680
Oh.

2492
01:36:58,300 --> 01:37:00,260
That guy looks like a big butt guy.

2493
01:37:01,060 --> 01:37:02,240
Looks like a big boy.

2494
01:37:06,550 --> 01:37:07,730
Alright, let me...

2495
01:37:08,830 --> 01:37:09,870
Drink some of his.

2496
01:37:10,090 --> 01:37:10,990
You think I can take him?

2497
01:37:11,350 --> 01:37:12,670
I think I can take him.

2498
01:37:14,390 --> 01:37:15,090
That's right.

2499
01:37:15,090 --> 01:37:17,990
I cured schizophrenia.

2500
01:37:18,550 --> 01:37:19,610
And insanity.

2501
01:37:19,930 --> 01:37:21,050
And psychopaths.

2502
01:37:21,550 --> 01:37:21,950
Psychopathy?

2503
01:37:22,710 --> 01:37:23,630
How did this guy die?

2504
01:37:24,930 --> 01:37:26,330
I cured them all.

2505
01:37:27,650 --> 01:37:28,830
You're welcome.

2506
01:37:29,530 --> 01:37:31,890
Now you don't have to take meds anymore.

2507
01:37:33,810 --> 01:37:35,190
Oh, this guy looks big.

2508
01:37:35,550 --> 01:37:36,870
Wait, what if I can...

2509
01:37:36,870 --> 01:37:38,210
Oh, I know what to do.

2510
01:37:38,530 --> 01:37:39,450
Get over here.

2511
01:37:44,050 --> 01:37:44,450
Matt.

2512
01:37:46,270 --> 01:37:47,030
Oh, shit!

2513
01:37:47,270 --> 01:37:47,710
Oh, okay.

2514
01:37:47,830 --> 01:37:48,010
Wait, wait.

2515
01:37:48,070 --> 01:37:49,230
Actually, I think I can actually...

2516
01:37:49,230 --> 01:37:49,490
Oh!

2517
01:37:50,690 --> 01:37:51,370
Oh, wait!

2518
01:37:51,470 --> 01:37:52,410
Don't think I can take him.

2519
01:37:52,610 --> 01:37:53,450
Oh my God.

2520
01:37:53,790 --> 01:37:55,250
Wait, I actually don't think I can take him.

2521
01:37:55,410 --> 01:37:56,410
Oh my God.

2522
01:37:56,630 --> 01:37:58,130
Wait, I don't think I can take him, guys.

2523
01:37:58,590 --> 01:37:59,630
And he knows...

2524
01:37:59,630 --> 01:38:00,990
Who doesn't do magic?

2525
01:38:02,230 --> 01:38:03,030
Holy fu...

2526
01:38:05,990 --> 01:38:08,450
WHY DOES EVERYONE IN THIS WORLD KNOW MAGIC?!

2527
01:38:10,150 --> 01:38:12,190
Okay, guys, I don't think I can take him.

2528
01:38:12,610 --> 01:38:15,810
I don't think I can take him, guys.

2529
01:38:16,670 --> 01:38:17,770
I'm just gonna leave.

2530
01:38:18,350 --> 01:38:19,990
I know he's too thick for this.

2531
01:38:21,830 --> 01:38:23,530
There's no way he can get in here.

2532
01:38:28,950 --> 01:38:30,870
Okay, man, he light my way.

2533
01:38:31,030 --> 01:38:31,670
Ooh, what's this?

2534
01:38:34,090 --> 01:38:35,510
You must have a puzzle.

2535
01:38:35,650 --> 01:38:37,470
I can't solve puzzles?!

2536
01:38:39,090 --> 01:38:41,710
Is hitting things solving a puzzle?

2537
01:38:43,230 --> 01:38:44,250
Fiddle time!

2538
01:38:45,550 --> 01:38:47,990
Where the fuck is the...?

2539
01:38:49,050 --> 01:38:50,430
Oh, it's outside.

2540
01:38:50,850 --> 01:38:52,010
But he's outside.

2541
01:38:53,250 --> 01:38:54,070
Oh, no.

2542
01:38:54,370 --> 01:38:55,710
He's outside, though.

2543
01:38:57,950 --> 01:38:59,990
He's just waiting for me.

2544
01:39:04,760 --> 01:39:06,660
Where could this puzzle be?

2545
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:08,460
Down here?

2546
01:39:12,640 --> 01:39:13,380
Oh, hey.

2547
01:39:13,720 --> 01:39:14,700
Grab this item.

2548
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:18,220
I think there's anything here.

2549
01:39:19,420 --> 01:39:20,940
No dead end ahead?

2550
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:23,640
What is a dead end?

2551
01:39:24,980 --> 01:39:26,120
There's nothing here.

2552
01:39:31,870 --> 01:39:32,470
Oh!

2553
01:39:32,670 --> 01:39:33,770
At least I got some mushrooms.

2554
01:39:36,570 --> 01:39:38,070
I don't think I have it.

2555
01:39:38,330 --> 01:39:39,310
Canyon emote?

2556
01:39:39,550 --> 01:39:41,350
Okay, I definitely don't have it.

2557
01:39:42,290 --> 01:39:43,670
I know that for sure.

2558
01:39:44,910 --> 01:39:46,610
Alright, guess we don't do a riddle.

2559
01:39:49,210 --> 01:39:50,670
No riddles for me.

2560
01:39:51,370 --> 01:39:52,630
How did people die here?

2561
01:40:02,580 --> 01:40:04,280
Okay, we're not doing that.

2562
01:40:05,620 --> 01:40:08,540
There's a lot of deaths here.

2563
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:09,060
Wait.

2564
01:40:09,320 --> 01:40:10,260
This one might be easy.

2565
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:15,400
But where does he go after that?

2566
01:40:25,660 --> 01:40:26,280
Okay.

2567
01:40:33,190 --> 01:40:34,250
I did it!

2568
01:40:35,150 --> 01:40:35,330
Yay!

2569
01:40:36,650 --> 01:40:38,030
I mean, I assume it's here.

2570
01:40:38,910 --> 01:40:39,230
Yeah.

2571
01:40:39,430 --> 01:40:40,550
Wait, how did he fuck it up?

2572
01:40:44,090 --> 01:40:45,630
Where the fuck was he going?

2573
01:40:49,370 --> 01:40:50,690
What the fuck?

2574
01:40:52,350 --> 01:40:53,310
What the fuck?

2575
01:40:53,410 --> 01:40:54,310
That was so easy!

2576
01:40:54,530 --> 01:40:55,730
How did they fuck that up?

2577
01:40:59,450 --> 01:41:01,990
Seek precious item and then try self?

2578
01:41:03,230 --> 01:41:03,370
Oh!

2579
01:41:03,910 --> 01:41:05,190
Is there a precious item here?

2580
01:41:08,250 --> 01:41:09,510
I don't see anything.

2581
01:41:11,430 --> 01:41:11,990
Oh!

2582
01:41:15,350 --> 01:41:15,910
Oh!

2583
01:41:16,470 --> 01:41:17,030
Oh!

2584
01:41:17,190 --> 01:41:17,790
Wait.

2585
01:41:18,370 --> 01:41:19,190
Oh, fuck.

2586
01:41:19,370 --> 01:41:19,750
Okay, wait.

2587
01:41:21,050 --> 01:41:22,390
Oh, I don't have magic.

2588
01:41:22,610 --> 01:41:23,190
God damn it.

2589
01:41:23,310 --> 01:41:23,870
Okay, there...

2590
01:41:23,870 --> 01:41:25,470
Okay, this is...

2591
01:41:25,470 --> 01:41:25,870
Okay.

2592
01:41:25,970 --> 01:41:27,150
There might be a grace nearby.

2593
01:41:27,730 --> 01:41:29,010
Maybe I'll find a grace.

2594
01:41:29,350 --> 01:41:29,870
Okay, guys.

2595
01:41:29,990 --> 01:41:31,170
Is there a grace anywhere?

2596
01:41:32,590 --> 01:41:34,550
I might need to refill some magic.

2597
01:41:37,010 --> 01:41:37,890
And some...

2598
01:41:37,890 --> 01:41:38,550
And some heals.

2599
01:41:39,670 --> 01:41:41,610
No, I don't think it'll be fine.

2600
01:41:41,830 --> 01:41:42,270
Guys!

2601
01:41:43,170 --> 01:41:44,610
Guys, he's glowing!

2602
01:41:44,610 --> 01:41:46,230
I don't...

2603
01:41:46,230 --> 01:41:48,190
I don't think it'll be fine.

2604
01:41:48,510 --> 01:41:49,770
He's fucking glowing!

2605
01:41:54,890 --> 01:41:57,010
It's behind him?!

2606
01:41:57,010 --> 01:41:57,690
Okay.

2607
01:41:59,930 --> 01:42:00,530
Alright.

2608
01:42:00,810 --> 01:42:01,910
I have a horse.

2609
01:42:02,150 --> 01:42:03,410
Maybe I can run past him.

2610
01:42:04,910 --> 01:42:05,510
Alright.

2611
01:42:05,990 --> 01:42:06,950
Okay, it's behind him.

2612
01:42:07,010 --> 01:42:07,470
That's fine.

2613
01:42:07,950 --> 01:42:09,330
That makes it easier then.

2614
01:42:09,510 --> 01:42:11,890
I can just grab my stuff back then from him.

2615
01:42:13,810 --> 01:42:15,530
It's just friendship, Aura.

2616
01:42:15,770 --> 01:42:16,110
Doki.

2617
01:42:16,810 --> 01:42:19,390
It just means he's a really good friend.

2618
01:42:23,110 --> 01:42:24,790
Wait, where is behind?

2619
01:42:27,270 --> 01:42:29,530
Guys, he's slowly walking towards me.

2620
01:42:38,300 --> 01:42:41,260
A god damn mosquito got me!

2621
01:42:43,620 --> 01:42:44,180
Please!

2622
01:42:44,460 --> 01:42:45,640
Open faster!

2623
01:42:46,040 --> 01:42:46,420
Please!

2624
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:47,560
For the love of god!

2625
01:42:47,720 --> 01:42:48,880
It's not that heavy!

2626
01:42:49,260 --> 01:42:50,240
Oh my god!

2627
01:42:53,330 --> 01:42:53,890
Oh!

2628
01:42:54,230 --> 01:42:55,030
Thank god!

2629
01:42:55,330 --> 01:42:55,690
Oh!

2630
01:42:55,870 --> 01:42:56,330
Thank god!

2631
01:42:56,670 --> 01:42:56,850
Please!

2632
01:42:57,030 --> 01:42:57,530
Sit down!

2633
01:42:57,870 --> 01:42:58,030
Please!

2634
01:42:58,290 --> 01:42:58,550
Oh!

2635
01:42:58,730 --> 01:42:59,090
Thank god!

2636
01:42:59,290 --> 01:42:59,450
Oh!

2637
01:42:59,970 --> 01:43:01,190
I sat down!

2638
01:43:03,210 --> 01:43:04,310
I sat down!

2639
01:43:04,530 --> 01:43:04,970
It's fine.

2640
01:43:05,490 --> 01:43:05,850
I...

2641
01:43:06,730 --> 01:43:07,870
I sat down.

2642
01:43:07,970 --> 01:43:08,430
It's okay.

2643
01:43:09,390 --> 01:43:09,950
Alright.

2644
01:43:09,970 --> 01:43:10,430
We're fine.

2645
01:43:10,430 --> 01:43:10,450
We're fine.

2646
01:43:13,490 --> 01:43:14,130
Okay.

2647
01:43:16,710 --> 01:43:17,950
I don't think he knows.

2648
01:43:19,710 --> 01:43:20,350
What?!

2649
01:43:20,350 --> 01:43:20,910
He doesn't?!

2650
01:43:27,790 --> 01:43:29,530
I go back downstairs.

2651
01:43:29,990 --> 01:43:30,350
I...

2652
01:43:34,690 --> 01:43:35,330
Okay.

2653
01:43:35,750 --> 01:43:36,970
I do it this time.

2654
01:43:37,910 --> 01:43:38,210
Alright.

2655
01:43:38,430 --> 01:43:40,450
But I also wanna make sure...

2656
01:43:44,350 --> 01:43:44,990
Okay.

2657
01:43:48,530 --> 01:43:49,010
Okay.

2658
01:43:49,110 --> 01:43:49,150
Okay.

2659
01:43:49,150 --> 01:43:49,450
I did...

2660
01:43:49,450 --> 01:43:49,570
Okay.

2661
01:43:49,690 --> 01:43:50,050
There we go.

2662
01:43:50,290 --> 01:43:50,730
There we go.

2663
01:43:50,850 --> 01:43:51,130
We're fine.

2664
01:43:51,290 --> 01:43:51,610
We're fine.

2665
01:43:52,450 --> 01:43:53,750
We're so healthy now.

2666
01:43:55,830 --> 01:43:56,770
Oh my god.

2667
01:43:56,970 --> 01:43:57,470
Oh my god.

2668
01:43:57,470 --> 01:43:57,490
Oh my god.

2669
01:43:57,550 --> 01:43:58,330
He's TPing.

2670
01:43:58,830 --> 01:44:00,270
That should be illegal.

2671
01:44:02,270 --> 01:44:03,310
Oh my god!

2672
01:44:11,060 --> 01:44:11,540
What?!

2673
01:44:11,540 --> 01:44:12,960
He's faster?!

2674
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:13,380
Oh!

2675
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:15,300
And he dodged it?!

2676
01:44:22,140 --> 01:44:23,480
Oh oh oh oh.

2677
01:44:23,540 --> 01:44:24,140
Oh oh oh oh oh oh.

2678
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:24,820
Yeah.

2679
01:44:24,940 --> 01:44:25,740
He can't TP forever.

2680
01:44:27,080 --> 01:44:27,620
Okay.

2681
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:28,200
Maybe you can.

2682
01:44:28,420 --> 01:44:29,860
Oh you are definitely faster!

2683
01:44:30,060 --> 01:44:32,200
Oh you are so much faster than me!

2684
01:44:33,420 --> 01:44:33,960
Oh.

2685
01:44:34,160 --> 01:44:34,700
What?!

2686
01:44:34,700 --> 01:44:35,460
Oh my...

2687
01:44:41,650 --> 01:44:41,920
Guys.

2688
01:44:42,380 --> 01:44:42,720
Guys.

2689
01:44:43,180 --> 01:44:46,560
I'm really worried about what this, the symbol means at the bottom.

2690
01:44:46,760 --> 01:44:47,860
I'm so worried.

2691
01:44:47,860 --> 01:44:52,360
Sorry, I don't know what it means, and I'm trying to make sure I don't get hit from whatever it is.

2692
01:44:59,130 --> 01:45:00,270
I hate you.

2693
01:45:01,730 --> 01:45:03,470
It looks so omnibus.

2694
01:45:07,610 --> 01:45:09,270
Okay, now I know.

2695
01:45:20,010 --> 01:45:21,070
I hate you.

2696
01:45:21,270 --> 01:45:21,830
I hate you.

2697
01:45:22,810 --> 01:45:22,850
Oh!

2698
01:45:25,850 --> 01:45:31,250
Okay, I'm trying to make sure he doesn't get close to getting that bar full up, because I don't want to know what it does.

2699
01:45:31,490 --> 01:45:34,930
I really don't... I really don't want to know what it does, guys.

2700
01:45:35,190 --> 01:45:36,910
I don't feel confident.

2701
01:45:40,530 --> 01:45:40,930
Nice.

2702
01:45:41,850 --> 01:45:42,650
What the...

2703
01:45:42,650 --> 01:45:43,150
No!

2704
01:45:43,350 --> 01:45:43,770
No, no, no, no!

2705
01:45:43,930 --> 01:45:45,910
That almost killed me.

2706
01:45:46,130 --> 01:45:47,370
Oh, that almost killed me.

2707
01:45:51,970 --> 01:45:52,470
Oh!

2708
01:45:54,550 --> 01:45:55,050
Yes!

2709
01:45:55,270 --> 01:45:56,310
Oh, thank God!

2710
01:45:57,290 --> 01:45:58,290
I don't...

2711
01:45:58,290 --> 01:45:59,470
I just didn't want to know...

2712
01:45:59,470 --> 01:46:01,370
I really didn't want to know what it does.

2713
01:46:01,370 --> 01:46:03,610
It seems so dangerous!

2714
01:46:03,950 --> 01:46:05,410
Oh, thank God!

2715
01:46:05,890 --> 01:46:06,370
He's dead!

2716
01:46:06,910 --> 01:46:07,290
Okay.

2717
01:46:07,550 --> 01:46:09,610
And this is a dungeon, right?

2718
01:46:13,050 --> 01:46:14,810
He respawned?!

2719
01:46:15,870 --> 01:46:16,430
Oh!

2720
01:46:16,790 --> 01:46:17,490
Okay.

2721
01:46:19,390 --> 01:46:20,450
Okay, so there...

2722
01:46:20,450 --> 01:46:21,210
That was like...

2723
01:46:21,210 --> 01:46:21,570
No point.

2724
01:46:22,010 --> 01:46:22,450
That...

2725
01:46:22,890 --> 01:46:25,230
That was actually no point in me doing that.

2726
01:46:25,690 --> 01:46:27,090
He was just gonna respy.

2727
01:46:28,050 --> 01:46:28,810
Oh, shit.

2728
01:46:31,750 --> 01:46:32,190
Alright.

2729
01:46:33,330 --> 01:46:33,910
For gear?

2730
01:46:34,050 --> 01:46:35,130
What kind of gear does he give?

2731
01:46:35,390 --> 01:46:36,570
Wait, does he regenerate?

2732
01:46:37,310 --> 01:46:38,850
Okay, so I had to double kill him.

2733
01:46:40,170 --> 01:46:42,030
Then what the fuck was the point?!

2734
01:46:43,530 --> 01:46:45,990
If he could just come back to life like that.

2735
01:46:46,550 --> 01:46:47,390
Time for pickle.

2736
01:46:53,260 --> 01:46:54,680
Oh, that has to be a guy.

2737
01:46:54,820 --> 01:46:55,480
Yeah, I knew it.

2738
01:46:57,680 --> 01:46:58,680
That's fucking right.

2739
01:46:59,120 --> 01:47:00,120
Get distracted!

2740
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:02,720
Because you have to readjust your head!

2741
01:47:03,640 --> 01:47:04,120
Oh.

2742
01:47:04,360 --> 01:47:05,220
I can't go through that.

2743
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:06,600
Oh, I forgot again.

2744
01:47:07,740 --> 01:47:07,860
Oh!

2745
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:08,240
Oh!

2746
01:47:16,420 --> 01:47:17,060
That's fine.

2747
01:47:19,980 --> 01:47:20,400
Wait.

2748
01:47:21,220 --> 01:47:22,200
I'm trying to...

2749
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:22,600
Wait!

2750
01:47:22,820 --> 01:47:24,640
I'm trying to kill this one guy!

2751
01:47:27,700 --> 01:47:28,120
Alright.

2752
01:47:29,780 --> 01:47:31,600
Okay, there were so many enemies there.

2753
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:34,100
Oh.

2754
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:35,880
Oh.

2755
01:47:37,780 --> 01:47:39,000
Sage, thank you for the super chat.

2756
01:47:39,100 --> 01:47:39,660
Thank you, thank you.

2757
01:47:39,700 --> 01:47:40,500
Is that an archer?

2758
01:47:40,640 --> 01:47:41,940
Oh my god, it is an archer.

2759
01:47:42,060 --> 01:47:43,580
Oh my god, it is an archer.

2760
01:47:44,280 --> 01:47:45,280
Oh, it is.

2761
01:47:45,900 --> 01:47:47,620
No, I'm trying to read my message!

2762
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:48,520
Didn't expect high...

2763
01:47:48,520 --> 01:47:48,720
Okay.

2764
01:47:49,720 --> 01:47:50,140
High ground.

2765
01:47:51,300 --> 01:47:52,380
What do you mean, high ground?

2766
01:47:53,440 --> 01:47:54,800
I'M TRIED TO READ!

2767
01:47:55,760 --> 01:47:56,960
Didn't expect high road.

2768
01:47:57,120 --> 01:47:57,300
Okay.

2769
01:47:58,800 --> 01:47:59,480
I got this.

2770
01:48:04,060 --> 01:48:04,460
Okay.

2771
01:48:10,410 --> 01:48:11,310
Okay, I can kill him.

2772
01:48:14,390 --> 01:48:15,670
Alright, I'm gonna get him out first.

2773
01:48:17,990 --> 01:48:19,150
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

2774
01:48:19,150 --> 01:48:20,250
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

2775
01:48:28,010 --> 01:48:28,650
There!

2776
01:48:29,150 --> 01:48:31,330
It was against the wall!

2777
01:48:35,900 --> 01:48:37,420
It's not fair!

2778
01:48:39,550 --> 01:48:43,750
How can I kill it in his... against the fucking...

2779
01:49:00,380 --> 01:49:01,260
Okay.

2780
01:49:04,940 --> 01:49:06,320
Oh my god, please.

2781
01:49:06,680 --> 01:49:08,320
Please, I'm trying to get above.

2782
01:49:10,260 --> 01:49:11,860
Wait, how do I get above it?

2783
01:49:12,020 --> 01:49:12,960
Oh my god.

2784
01:49:13,120 --> 01:49:14,600
Okay, clear it up.

2785
01:49:16,240 --> 01:49:16,660
Okay.

2786
01:49:19,160 --> 01:49:19,900
Where is he?

2787
01:49:20,100 --> 01:49:21,200
Oh my god, there you are.

2788
01:49:21,560 --> 01:49:22,380
It must be you.

2789
01:49:22,600 --> 01:49:23,740
It's you, isn't it?

2790
01:49:23,960 --> 01:49:24,660
It's you!

2791
01:49:29,170 --> 01:49:30,490
Okay, okay, now he's dead.

2792
01:49:30,670 --> 01:49:31,010
Thank God.

2793
01:49:31,770 --> 01:49:31,950
Alright.

2794
01:49:38,140 --> 01:49:41,020
Okay, I need to figure out where the necromancer is.

2795
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:48,840
Jesus Christ.

2796
01:49:49,860 --> 01:49:50,580
Oh, there you are.

2797
01:49:50,780 --> 01:49:51,380
There you are.

2798
01:49:51,580 --> 01:49:52,200
There you are.

2799
01:49:52,500 --> 01:49:53,560
There you- Oh no!

2800
01:49:53,780 --> 01:49:54,340
Message of praise!

2801
01:49:54,520 --> 01:49:55,460
Message of praise, please!

2802
01:49:57,880 --> 01:49:58,360
Okay.

2803
01:49:58,700 --> 01:49:59,860
Oh my god, I hate them.

2804
01:49:59,980 --> 01:50:00,720
I hate all of them.

2805
01:50:01,640 --> 01:50:02,860
They're so annoying.

2806
01:50:03,780 --> 01:50:05,040
No hidden path ahead.

2807
01:50:05,260 --> 01:50:06,100
Attacking ahead.

2808
01:50:11,720 --> 01:50:13,620
Wait, I don't think you have- Oh ho ho!

2809
01:50:13,900 --> 01:50:16,320
I know you don't have a necromancer.

2810
01:50:16,640 --> 01:50:17,780
That's right!

2811
01:50:19,040 --> 01:50:20,940
No one will help you now.

2812
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:26,720
Oh shit.

2813
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:27,400
Oh shit!

2814
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:29,000
Oh my god, who's gonna help me?

2815
01:50:29,180 --> 01:50:29,700
Who's- No!

2816
01:50:29,880 --> 01:50:30,200
Oh!

2817
01:50:30,380 --> 01:50:30,640
Yes!

2818
01:50:31,060 --> 01:50:31,540
Oh!

2819
01:50:31,540 --> 01:50:31,540
Ah!

2820
01:50:31,800 --> 01:50:32,260
Oh!

2821
01:50:33,260 --> 01:50:34,600
Somebody help me!

2822
01:50:35,180 --> 01:50:35,820
Wait!

2823
01:50:37,700 --> 01:50:39,160
Where's the necromancer?

2824
01:50:44,280 --> 01:50:44,920
Okay.

2825
01:50:47,800 --> 01:50:51,220
Wait, but like, is this a good hole or a bad hole?

2826
01:50:56,200 --> 01:50:56,840
Guys.

2827
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:02,940
I can't tell if it's a good hole or a bad hole.

2828
01:51:06,600 --> 01:51:07,520
Hit the wall.

2829
01:51:07,740 --> 01:51:07,780
Hit the wall?

2830
01:51:07,780 --> 01:51:08,080
Which one?

2831
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:08,640
This one?

2832
01:51:10,580 --> 01:51:11,060
Oh!

2833
01:51:11,460 --> 01:51:11,880
Ooh!

2834
01:51:12,120 --> 01:51:12,400
Magic!

2835
01:51:16,040 --> 01:51:16,900
Oh shit.

2836
01:51:18,860 --> 01:51:19,520
Okay, wait.

2837
01:51:19,600 --> 01:51:21,940
I have what- I have enough to level up.

2838
01:51:22,500 --> 01:51:23,600
I'm going back down.

2839
01:51:24,760 --> 01:51:25,520
Okay, guys.

2840
01:51:25,700 --> 01:51:26,980
I know how to get back here.

2841
01:51:28,980 --> 01:51:30,580
I'm going to go level up real fast.

2842
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:33,000
I don't want to lose my shit.

2843
01:51:33,440 --> 01:51:37,100
I- I don't want to- Guys.

2844
01:51:37,420 --> 01:51:39,980
I don't want to lose my XP.

2845
01:51:43,690 --> 01:51:44,310
All right.

2846
01:51:44,950 --> 01:51:46,050
Dungeon will reset.

2847
01:51:48,670 --> 01:51:49,350
It's okay.

2848
01:51:49,510 --> 01:51:50,950
I can just run past all of them.

2849
01:51:52,350 --> 01:51:52,790
Guys.

2850
01:51:52,910 --> 01:51:53,910
I don't trust the process.

2851
01:51:54,110 --> 01:51:54,590
That's the thing.

2852
01:51:54,730 --> 01:51:56,250
I- I know me.

2853
01:51:58,930 --> 01:52:00,250
I know myself.

2854
01:52:00,490 --> 01:52:03,550
I 100% do not trust the process.

2855
01:52:07,200 --> 01:52:07,720
All right.

2856
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:08,320
Level up.

2857
01:52:09,880 --> 01:52:10,320
Dexterity.

2858
01:52:11,620 --> 01:52:12,480
Okay, here we go.

2859
01:52:13,140 --> 01:52:16,760
All right, now- Okay, now I know what to do.

2860
01:52:19,960 --> 01:52:21,860
We can just get past all of these, actually.

2861
01:52:21,860 --> 01:52:22,520
And you know what?

2862
01:52:22,520 --> 01:52:23,480
I'm going to run past all of them.

2863
01:52:24,840 --> 01:52:26,200
I don't think it really matters.

2864
01:52:31,440 --> 01:52:32,100
It's like here.

2865
01:52:35,420 --> 01:52:36,460
And then...

2866
01:52:39,650 --> 01:52:40,550
Okay.

2867
01:52:42,490 --> 01:52:43,230
Here we go.

2868
01:52:43,950 --> 01:52:44,430
Ha ha ha!

2869
01:52:44,910 --> 01:52:45,930
Ha ha ha!

2870
01:52:47,010 --> 01:52:47,690
Ha ha!

2871
01:52:48,630 --> 01:52:49,370
Here we go.

2872
01:52:52,230 --> 01:52:53,270
And then...

2873
01:52:53,970 --> 01:52:55,550
Okay, and then we kill him.

2874
01:52:55,550 --> 01:52:56,830
Oh shit!

2875
01:52:57,130 --> 01:52:58,130
I forgot about him!

2876
01:52:58,330 --> 01:52:58,590
No!

2877
01:52:59,550 --> 01:53:00,290
Ha ha ha!

2878
01:53:00,610 --> 01:53:02,030
I got comboed!

2879
01:53:02,290 --> 01:53:02,790
Ah!

2880
01:53:04,230 --> 01:53:05,370
Holy shit!

2881
01:53:05,770 --> 01:53:11,370
I got comboed so- Oh my god!

2882
01:53:12,270 --> 01:53:13,710
I was like, ha ha!

2883
01:53:13,850 --> 01:53:15,530
I remember all of this!

2884
01:53:15,750 --> 01:53:17,190
But do you, Toki?

2885
01:53:17,410 --> 01:53:20,330
Do you really remember all of this?

2886
01:53:22,930 --> 01:53:25,270
Guys, I didn't remember all of it.

2887
01:53:25,270 --> 01:53:26,370
Jokes on me.

2888
01:53:26,570 --> 01:53:27,270
I didn't.

2889
01:53:27,950 --> 01:53:29,170
She did not.

2890
01:53:31,690 --> 01:53:32,630
Okay, now!

2891
01:53:35,950 --> 01:53:36,530
Okay.

2892
01:53:37,090 --> 01:53:37,790
Oh god.

2893
01:53:38,050 --> 01:53:39,150
Please, please seek me up.

2894
01:53:39,350 --> 01:53:39,970
Please seek me up.

2895
01:53:40,790 --> 01:53:41,590
Oh, thank god.

2896
01:53:43,730 --> 01:53:44,110
Okay.

2897
01:53:45,710 --> 01:53:46,030
Alright.

2898
01:53:46,850 --> 01:53:48,150
Get my shit back real fast.

2899
01:53:53,850 --> 01:53:54,910
Okay, that's not me.

2900
01:53:55,330 --> 01:53:56,570
That's actually on me.

2901
01:53:57,810 --> 01:53:58,330
Oh.

2902
01:53:58,570 --> 01:53:59,410
Oh my god.

2903
01:53:59,630 --> 01:54:00,170
That's on me!

2904
01:54:00,490 --> 01:54:01,670
I deserved it!

2905
01:54:02,810 --> 01:54:03,330
Okay.

2906
01:54:04,010 --> 01:54:04,290
Alright.

2907
01:54:04,650 --> 01:54:05,710
Now we just hit the wall.

2908
01:54:06,590 --> 01:54:07,110
Dang!

2909
01:54:07,510 --> 01:54:08,610
What a shot!

2910
01:54:10,470 --> 01:54:10,990
Alright.

2911
01:54:11,650 --> 01:54:13,050
Let's see what this brings me.

2912
01:54:15,950 --> 01:54:16,950
Who are you?

2913
01:54:17,550 --> 01:54:18,910
Oh, I can't...

2914
01:54:18,910 --> 01:54:19,950
I can't use...

2915
01:54:20,890 --> 01:54:21,910
He's so fast!

2916
01:54:22,430 --> 01:54:23,430
Wait, he's so fast!

2917
01:54:23,810 --> 01:54:24,810
I don't like that!

2918
01:54:26,110 --> 01:54:27,070
Oh my god!

2919
01:54:27,250 --> 01:54:28,050
Oh my god!

2920
01:54:28,110 --> 01:54:28,970
Why are you so fast?

2921
01:54:29,210 --> 01:54:30,470
Why are you so fast?

2922
01:54:30,890 --> 01:54:31,170
Oh!

2923
01:54:33,290 --> 01:54:33,770
Oh!

2924
01:54:33,770 --> 01:54:33,970
Oh!

2925
01:54:35,430 --> 01:54:36,110
Okay.

2926
01:54:38,190 --> 01:54:39,030
Oh no.

2927
01:54:40,430 --> 01:54:41,110
Five.

2928
01:54:41,910 --> 01:54:43,330
Oh, it's not five.

2929
01:54:46,750 --> 01:54:47,930
It's not five.

2930
01:54:49,910 --> 01:54:50,510
Woo!

2931
01:54:53,680 --> 01:54:54,360
Nice.

2932
01:54:56,140 --> 01:54:56,920
Okay.

2933
01:54:58,100 --> 01:54:58,860
Sneer recharge.

2934
01:55:00,040 --> 01:55:00,480
Oh!

2935
01:55:03,790 --> 01:55:04,970
Stop lying!

2936
01:55:05,250 --> 01:55:05,830
It's cheating!

2937
01:55:09,900 --> 01:55:10,660
Nice.

2938
01:55:13,460 --> 01:55:13,840
Okay.

2939
01:55:16,600 --> 01:55:16,980
No!

2940
01:55:17,640 --> 01:55:19,060
He predicted me!

2941
01:55:20,520 --> 01:55:21,520
You know what?

2942
01:55:21,700 --> 01:55:22,660
He knew what I wanted to do!

2943
01:55:30,180 --> 01:55:31,220
He was like...

2944
01:55:31,220 --> 01:55:31,940
Get predicted!

2945
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:33,740
He knew!

2946
01:55:34,240 --> 01:55:34,980
He knew!

2947
01:55:35,060 --> 01:55:35,900
He's so smart!

2948
01:55:36,200 --> 01:55:37,380
He's so smart!

2949
01:55:37,540 --> 01:55:37,720
No!

2950
01:55:38,420 --> 01:55:39,780
He predicted!

2951
01:55:43,880 --> 01:55:44,840
He...

2952
01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:46,380
He predicted me!

2953
01:55:46,540 --> 01:55:47,320
I panicked!

2954
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:48,600
He faded me!

2955
01:55:49,880 --> 01:55:52,080
I started panicking!

2956
01:55:52,820 --> 01:55:55,000
I was so close too!

2957
01:55:56,820 --> 01:55:59,300
He read me like a book!

2958
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:06,160
He threw fire at me and then I kept... stop, drop, and roll!

2959
01:56:07,320 --> 01:56:10,380
I was like, if I stop, drop, and roll, I'll live!

2960
01:56:15,770 --> 01:56:17,010
What the fuck?

2961
01:56:17,650 --> 01:56:18,710
Get out of here.

2962
01:56:25,770 --> 01:56:26,370
Alright.

2963
01:56:27,110 --> 01:56:27,470
Ow.

2964
01:56:28,830 --> 01:56:29,430
Ow.

2965
01:56:30,850 --> 01:56:31,410
Ow.

2966
01:56:32,130 --> 01:56:32,670
That's it.

2967
01:56:32,750 --> 01:56:33,050
I'm leaving.

2968
01:56:33,430 --> 01:56:33,870
I'm...

2969
01:56:36,850 --> 01:56:37,970
Holy shit.

2970
01:56:38,250 --> 01:56:39,050
Please let me leave.

2971
01:56:39,790 --> 01:56:40,810
Oh, please.

2972
01:56:41,170 --> 01:56:42,770
Please just let me leave.

2973
01:56:43,170 --> 01:56:44,330
Oh, there's so many arrows.

2974
01:56:46,290 --> 01:56:46,850
Please.

2975
01:56:47,570 --> 01:56:48,050
Oh.

2976
01:56:49,370 --> 01:56:50,130
That's fine.

2977
01:56:50,130 --> 01:56:55,690
I'm going in with one, two less... two less grenade... two less heals, but that's okay.

2978
01:56:56,210 --> 01:56:57,090
That's okay.

2979
01:56:57,090 --> 01:56:57,130
Okay.

2980
01:56:58,230 --> 01:56:59,330
I don't need it.

2981
01:57:00,670 --> 01:57:02,990
I don't... I don't need it, guys.

2982
01:57:03,350 --> 01:57:04,790
I definitely don't need it.

2983
01:57:05,150 --> 01:57:07,610
Let me grab this first, before you beat me up.

2984
01:57:09,510 --> 01:57:10,030
Woo!

2985
01:57:13,540 --> 01:57:14,280
Jesus Christ.

2986
01:57:15,240 --> 01:57:16,340
It's so fast.

2987
01:57:16,660 --> 01:57:17,200
I hate it.

2988
01:57:21,700 --> 01:57:22,220
Okay.

2989
01:57:22,740 --> 01:57:23,480
Focus, Doki.

2990
01:57:23,880 --> 01:57:24,400
Focus.

2991
01:57:24,740 --> 01:57:24,960
Whoa!

2992
01:57:25,200 --> 01:57:25,520
No!

2993
01:57:26,080 --> 01:57:28,480
I said focus, not the other way around!

2994
01:57:30,740 --> 01:57:31,320
Oh, no!

2995
01:57:31,400 --> 01:57:31,400
Oh, no.

2996
01:57:34,220 --> 01:57:34,620
Yeah.

2997
01:57:36,080 --> 01:57:36,440
There we go.

2998
01:57:38,260 --> 01:57:38,660
Oh.

2999
01:57:39,100 --> 01:57:39,720
I have to dodge in.

3000
01:57:40,120 --> 01:57:40,880
Just in time.

3001
01:57:41,260 --> 01:57:41,860
Oh, no!

3002
01:57:41,940 --> 01:57:42,460
Not in time!

3003
01:57:42,620 --> 01:57:43,100
Not in time!

3004
01:57:43,220 --> 01:57:43,760
Not in time!

3005
01:57:43,880 --> 01:57:44,200
I lied!

3006
01:57:48,400 --> 01:57:49,220
Oh, my God.

3007
01:57:49,340 --> 01:57:49,780
Are you serious?

3008
01:57:50,440 --> 01:57:52,460
Sometimes I can't see, like, where he's...

3009
01:57:53,140 --> 01:57:56,360
where he's trying to move, because he's so... he, like, blends in.

3010
01:57:57,260 --> 01:58:00,500
He actually blends in sometimes, and it's so annoying.

3011
01:58:03,480 --> 01:58:03,920
No!

3012
01:58:05,580 --> 01:58:06,600
No, no, no, no, no, no!

3013
01:58:13,580 --> 01:58:14,020
Okay.

3014
01:58:15,980 --> 01:58:16,800
Jesus Christ.

3015
01:58:20,140 --> 01:58:20,740
Oh, no.

3016
01:58:20,920 --> 01:58:21,220
Please.

3017
01:58:21,440 --> 01:58:22,200
I won't be greedy.

3018
01:58:22,360 --> 01:58:22,980
I won't be greedy.

3019
01:58:23,260 --> 01:58:23,480
Yes!

3020
01:58:23,660 --> 01:58:24,400
I got greedy!

3021
01:58:24,600 --> 01:58:24,860
Yes!

3022
01:58:24,980 --> 01:58:25,400
It worked!

3023
01:58:27,980 --> 01:58:29,900
Oh, thank God!

3024
01:58:30,540 --> 01:58:32,480
Thank God for being greedy!

3025
01:58:33,780 --> 01:58:35,540
Thank fucking God!

3026
01:58:37,320 --> 01:58:39,220
Sage regret.

3027
01:58:39,920 --> 01:58:41,120
That's fucking right.

3028
01:58:43,900 --> 01:58:45,960
A weak foe.

3029
01:58:49,860 --> 01:58:51,120
That's fucking right.

3030
01:58:53,020 --> 01:58:55,040
Return me to the entrance!

3031
01:59:03,220 --> 01:59:04,800
Am I done with this dungeon?

3032
01:59:05,220 --> 01:59:06,420
Or, like, is there more?

3033
01:59:09,780 --> 01:59:10,720
There's still more?

3034
01:59:10,860 --> 01:59:12,240
Oh, that wasn't a main boss?

3035
01:59:12,420 --> 01:59:12,840
Oh, fuck.

3036
01:59:12,980 --> 01:59:15,080
Okay, I gotta find the ending for this.

3037
01:59:17,700 --> 01:59:19,600
Oh, that was a secret boss.

3038
01:59:19,780 --> 01:59:19,940
Okay.

3039
01:59:20,420 --> 01:59:22,320
Oh, I assume that's where the boss is.

3040
01:59:22,640 --> 01:59:23,000
Okay.

3041
01:59:23,220 --> 01:59:25,720
I just need to figure out how to get out of here.

3042
01:59:31,120 --> 01:59:31,600
Alright.

3043
01:59:34,960 --> 01:59:36,500
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

3044
01:59:36,540 --> 01:59:36,920
Goodbye.

3045
01:59:37,980 --> 01:59:39,360
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

3046
01:59:39,620 --> 01:59:40,100
Goodbye.

3047
01:59:41,580 --> 01:59:42,400
Okay, I didn't want...

3048
01:59:42,400 --> 01:59:42,640
Oh!

3049
01:59:42,920 --> 01:59:43,400
God, hello!

3050
01:59:45,080 --> 01:59:45,560
Hello.

3051
01:59:47,720 --> 01:59:48,200
Slatter.

3052
01:59:50,300 --> 01:59:50,780
God?

3053
01:59:51,240 --> 01:59:51,620
Oh.

3054
01:59:53,080 --> 01:59:54,300
I mean, they seem nice.

3055
01:59:55,160 --> 01:59:56,360
Oh my God!

3056
01:59:57,200 --> 01:59:57,660
Oh!

3057
01:59:57,920 --> 01:59:58,900
None of you are nice, though!

3058
01:59:59,020 --> 01:59:59,440
Not you!

3059
01:59:59,580 --> 01:59:59,920
Not you!

3060
02:00:00,040 --> 02:00:00,440
Not you!

3061
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:08,280
Oh, but this guy is a regular skeleton, so I don't have to worry about it.

3062
02:00:10,140 --> 02:00:10,600
Okay.

3063
02:00:14,040 --> 02:00:19,260
Okay, the only issue is that this guy is a necromancer skeleton, so...

3064
02:00:20,140 --> 02:00:20,600
Uh...

3065
02:00:20,600 --> 02:00:21,860
I don't know.

3066
02:00:24,700 --> 02:00:25,800
Oh, I don't know.

3067
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:26,680
Oh, I don't know.

3068
02:00:26,820 --> 02:00:27,700
I'm just gonna leave.

3069
02:00:28,240 --> 02:00:29,200
Pathetic sword ahead?

3070
02:00:32,840 --> 02:00:34,000
Aww...

3071
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:34,800
Oh!

3072
02:00:35,480 --> 02:00:36,020
Oh!

3073
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:37,600
Oh,

3074
02:00:41,220 --> 02:00:42,100
I don't...

3075
02:00:42,100 --> 02:00:42,460
Oh!

3076
02:00:42,720 --> 02:00:43,040
Okay!

3077
02:00:43,400 --> 02:00:44,020
Okay.

3078
02:00:45,460 --> 02:00:46,700
Okay, that's awkward.

3079
02:00:48,080 --> 02:00:49,060
That's awkward.

3080
02:00:50,280 --> 02:00:50,920
Yeah.

3081
02:00:51,400 --> 02:00:51,700
Bye.

3082
02:00:52,900 --> 02:00:54,240
Oh, there's two of you.

3083
02:00:54,460 --> 02:00:54,920
Oh, okay.

3084
02:00:55,120 --> 02:00:55,480
That's cool.

3085
02:00:55,720 --> 02:00:56,320
That's cool.

3086
02:00:56,580 --> 02:00:57,280
That's cool.

3087
02:00:58,700 --> 02:00:59,940
Yeah, kill your kids.

3088
02:01:00,840 --> 02:01:01,720
That's right.

3089
02:01:02,080 --> 02:01:03,780
You're only killing your children.

3090
02:01:06,380 --> 02:01:07,020
Bye.

3091
02:01:08,900 --> 02:01:09,800
It's okay.

3092
02:01:10,160 --> 02:01:11,800
My ass cushioned it all.

3093
02:01:15,100 --> 02:01:16,340
Where do I go?

3094
02:01:19,200 --> 02:01:21,000
Like, do I go back down here?

3095
02:01:23,580 --> 02:01:25,000
What the fuck do I do?

3096
02:01:25,920 --> 02:01:27,220
Is that where I have to go?

3097
02:01:32,350 --> 02:01:33,610
There's a good hole?

3098
02:01:34,630 --> 02:01:36,090
When are holes good?

3099
02:01:42,720 --> 02:01:45,480
Oh, there's a hole by the secret boss.

3100
02:01:48,040 --> 02:01:49,840
Every hole is good, Doki.

3101
02:01:49,980 --> 02:01:50,880
What do you mean?

3102
02:01:54,220 --> 02:01:55,060
Shit.

3103
02:01:55,060 --> 02:01:56,500
I swear!

3104
02:01:58,320 --> 02:01:59,980
Oh my god!

3105
02:02:00,400 --> 02:02:01,540
Fuck you!

3106
02:02:02,100 --> 02:02:03,740
Actual fuck you!

3107
02:02:07,430 --> 02:02:08,810
Oh my god.

3108
02:02:09,890 --> 02:02:10,390
Woo!

3109
02:02:12,690 --> 02:02:13,970
Oh my god.

3110
02:02:14,150 --> 02:02:14,690
That good hole.

3111
02:02:14,830 --> 02:02:15,750
I remember now.

3112
02:02:18,730 --> 02:02:19,950
Good hole time.

3113
02:02:22,270 --> 02:02:22,830
Okay.

3114
02:02:23,150 --> 02:02:24,510
I'm on the other side.

3115
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:29,680
Too much.

3116
02:02:33,710 --> 02:02:34,510
All right.

3117
02:02:35,870 --> 02:02:36,730
All right.

3118
02:02:37,270 --> 02:02:37,830
Okay.

3119
02:02:38,830 --> 02:02:40,190
I... Okay.

3120
02:02:40,410 --> 02:02:41,450
That's... This is... Okay.

3121
02:02:41,510 --> 02:02:41,830
Thank god.

3122
02:02:41,970 --> 02:02:42,090
Okay.

3123
02:02:42,190 --> 02:02:42,810
I was gonna say.

3124
02:02:43,030 --> 02:02:45,330
Like, why can't I fucking... Oh!

3125
02:02:45,590 --> 02:02:46,750
There's so many things here.

3126
02:02:46,750 --> 02:02:46,750
Okay.

3127
02:02:46,750 --> 02:02:46,750
Okay.

3128
02:02:46,750 --> 02:02:46,750
There's so many things here.

3129
02:02:50,340 --> 02:02:51,740
Okay.

3130
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,220
Oh my god.

3131
02:02:58,760 --> 02:03:00,280
Super regenerating skeleton.

3132
02:03:00,280 --> 02:03:00,440
Skeleton.

3133
02:03:02,460 --> 02:03:05,060
Spooky scary skeleton.

3134
02:03:05,740 --> 02:03:07,900
Ba ba dum ba dum bum.

3135
02:03:08,540 --> 02:03:11,120
Ba ba dum ba dum bum.

3136
02:03:11,520 --> 02:03:12,200
Ba dum ba dum bum.

3137
02:03:14,080 --> 02:03:15,240
Alright, nice.

3138
02:03:16,540 --> 02:03:18,300
Alright, you go back.

3139
02:03:20,920 --> 02:03:21,760
Alright.

3140
02:03:22,180 --> 02:03:26,160
Back into the scary the scary corridor again.

3141
02:03:27,740 --> 02:03:29,120
This time I'll win.

3142
02:03:31,320 --> 02:03:32,320
Yeah I win.

3143
02:03:37,480 --> 02:03:39,100
Just a flesh wound, guys.

3144
02:03:39,280 --> 02:03:40,080
I'll still win.

3145
02:03:44,920 --> 02:03:45,760
I'm okay.

3146
02:03:46,260 --> 02:03:48,440
Don't worry, it's just a flesh wound.

3147
02:03:48,600 --> 02:03:49,480
I'm okay, guys.

3148
02:03:50,200 --> 02:03:51,060
I'm okay.

3149
02:03:52,020 --> 02:03:54,120
Alright, let me save...

3150
02:03:54,120 --> 02:03:56,980
Let me get some heals real quick.

3151
02:03:58,600 --> 02:04:00,320
Am I close enough to level up?

3152
02:04:00,440 --> 02:04:00,620
No.

3153
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:02,080
Oh, I could kill two skellies.

3154
02:04:02,200 --> 02:04:04,140
If I kill two skellies, I should be good.

3155
02:04:04,860 --> 02:04:06,080
I'll just farm this guy.

3156
02:04:10,660 --> 02:04:11,680
Get out of here.

3157
02:04:11,960 --> 02:04:12,920
Get out of here!

3158
02:04:13,060 --> 02:04:14,060
I need your XP!

3159
02:04:15,220 --> 02:04:15,960
That's right!

3160
02:04:16,300 --> 02:04:17,160
Oh, never mind.

3161
02:04:17,160 --> 02:04:18,580
It's more than two skellies, guys.

3162
02:04:18,940 --> 02:04:20,540
It's definitely a lot more.

3163
02:04:21,700 --> 02:04:23,740
Ooh, is it worth it?

3164
02:04:23,740 --> 02:04:25,300
To go down now.

3165
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:27,760
I could level up one more.

3166
02:04:28,140 --> 02:04:29,440
Oh yeah, I have runes!

3167
02:04:29,700 --> 02:04:30,220
You're right!

3168
02:04:30,660 --> 02:04:31,880
I almost forgot about that.

3169
02:04:32,340 --> 02:04:33,380
I have runes.

3170
02:04:35,440 --> 02:04:37,320
Alright, let me get the runes real quick.

3171
02:04:41,080 --> 02:04:42,100
Um... Oh, no.

3172
02:04:42,440 --> 02:04:42,960
Equipment.

3173
02:04:44,600 --> 02:04:45,340
Wait, no.

3174
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:46,360
Sorry.

3175
02:04:46,780 --> 02:04:48,060
It's like third time's the charm.

3176
02:04:49,240 --> 02:04:49,760
200.

3177
02:04:50,340 --> 02:04:51,320
I should use this one then.

3178
02:04:52,600 --> 02:04:53,660
That should be enough.

3179
02:04:57,540 --> 02:04:58,360
Level up.

3180
02:04:58,360 --> 02:04:58,420
Level up.

3181
02:04:58,640 --> 02:04:58,820
Level up.

3182
02:04:58,820 --> 02:04:59,080
Never mind.

3183
02:05:00,200 --> 02:05:01,100
One more.

3184
02:05:01,340 --> 02:05:02,500
one more for the road.

3185
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:05,500
Boop!

3186
02:05:07,400 --> 02:05:07,960
Alright.

3187
02:05:10,980 --> 02:05:11,900
Level up.

3188
02:05:12,220 --> 02:05:12,520
Alright.

3189
02:05:12,800 --> 02:05:14,780
Dexterity, vigor, or arcane?

3190
02:05:14,920 --> 02:05:15,120
Chat.

3191
02:05:21,810 --> 02:05:22,410
Vigor?

3192
02:05:27,640 --> 02:05:28,240
Dexterity?

3193
02:05:28,840 --> 02:05:30,020
Some arcane?

3194
02:05:30,200 --> 02:05:30,420
Okay.

3195
02:05:30,520 --> 02:05:31,120
I'll do arcane.

3196
02:05:31,780 --> 02:05:34,320
Does the arcane help move my bleed damage now?

3197
02:05:36,440 --> 02:05:38,380
I don't know if I'll hit the bleed, though.

3198
02:05:44,030 --> 02:05:44,530
Yeah?

3199
02:05:44,870 --> 02:05:45,210
Yes?

3200
02:05:45,330 --> 02:05:45,610
No?

3201
02:05:46,030 --> 02:05:46,390
Yeah?

3202
02:05:47,450 --> 02:05:48,810
It'll fill faster?

3203
02:05:49,410 --> 02:05:50,010
Okay.

3204
02:05:51,130 --> 02:05:52,930
Alright, I'll do arcane then.

3205
02:05:54,010 --> 02:05:56,390
Okay, and then... Do I have enough for flask?

3206
02:05:56,510 --> 02:05:56,990
I don't know.

3207
02:05:58,350 --> 02:05:59,970
No, how about the amount?

3208
02:06:00,430 --> 02:06:00,750
No.

3209
02:06:01,330 --> 02:06:01,910
Unlucky.

3210
02:06:01,910 --> 02:06:01,990
Unlucky.

3211
02:06:03,810 --> 02:06:05,510
Oh, is there something I could equip?

3212
02:06:06,930 --> 02:06:07,330
Oh!

3213
02:06:09,410 --> 02:06:09,810
Ooh!

3214
02:06:11,450 --> 02:06:13,470
I can get rid of this for vitality.

3215
02:06:14,770 --> 02:06:15,710
Alright, nice.

3216
02:06:15,950 --> 02:06:17,270
Wait, how did I...

3217
02:06:20,700 --> 02:06:22,640
How did I get, like, crazy already?

3218
02:06:25,960 --> 02:06:26,820
What the fuck?

3219
02:06:26,980 --> 02:06:29,100
Why is there, like, that thing at the bottom?

3220
02:06:33,850 --> 02:06:34,250
Oh!

3221
02:06:34,590 --> 02:06:35,770
Just because I equipped it?

3222
02:06:45,020 --> 02:06:46,380
Try summoning?

3223
02:06:46,520 --> 02:06:47,680
Wait, how bad is this?

3224
02:06:48,440 --> 02:06:49,160
Wait...

3225
02:06:49,160 --> 02:06:49,640
Wait...

3226
02:06:51,440 --> 02:06:52,160
How...

3227
02:06:52,160 --> 02:06:55,020
How bad is it that it requires me?

3228
02:06:58,300 --> 02:06:59,020
Praise...

3229
02:07:04,650 --> 02:07:05,370
Praise...

3230
02:07:05,370 --> 02:07:05,990
Praise the bird.

3231
02:07:07,250 --> 02:07:08,390
Praise the bird!

3232
02:07:11,190 --> 02:07:11,910
Alright...

3233
02:07:14,910 --> 02:07:16,390
Where is he?

3234
02:07:17,170 --> 02:07:18,230
Oh my god.

3235
02:07:18,250 --> 02:07:19,450
Oh my god!

3236
02:07:19,650 --> 02:07:20,690
What the fuck?

3237
02:07:21,610 --> 02:07:22,750
What the fuck?

3238
02:07:25,480 --> 02:07:27,240
Okay, I was definitely not ready.

3239
02:07:31,380 --> 02:07:35,240
To be fair, he like just... he peed in front of me!

3240
02:07:37,380 --> 02:07:39,420
It was like teleport behind you.

3241
02:07:40,100 --> 02:07:41,960
Oh my god, and he did it again!

3242
02:07:42,360 --> 02:07:43,280
He did it again!

3243
02:07:43,280 --> 02:07:43,280
No!

3244
02:07:47,480 --> 02:07:49,660
Wait, my junkfish is dead already?

3245
02:07:49,960 --> 02:07:50,320
How?

3246
02:07:50,920 --> 02:07:54,640
He just... I need to...

3247
02:07:58,410 --> 02:08:01,930
Okay, before... Okay, I'm gonna try and get this skeleton out of the way.

3248
02:08:02,130 --> 02:08:05,750
But do they come... Do these skeletons keep spawning?

3249
02:08:08,390 --> 02:08:09,630
I need to know.

3250
02:08:13,530 --> 02:08:14,750
Before... No?

3251
02:08:15,090 --> 02:08:15,430
Okay.

3252
02:08:17,850 --> 02:08:20,110
I... I'm... I'm so sad.

3253
02:08:20,530 --> 02:08:22,470
I'm... I'm so sad.

3254
02:08:23,230 --> 02:08:24,530
I'm so sad.

3255
02:08:25,110 --> 02:08:28,090
Like... Oh, he's so weak!

3256
02:08:28,250 --> 02:08:29,390
Wait, he's so weak!

3257
02:08:29,630 --> 02:08:30,430
Wait a minute!

3258
02:08:30,690 --> 02:08:31,630
He's so weak!

3259
02:08:31,690 --> 02:08:33,010
Why was I so afraid?

3260
02:08:34,490 --> 02:08:35,810
I know you're weak.

3261
02:08:39,990 --> 02:08:40,950
I'm not...

3262
02:08:40,950 --> 02:08:41,130
What?

3263
02:08:47,180 --> 02:08:47,800
Okay.

3264
02:08:47,940 --> 02:08:49,260
Okay, I got a little too cocky.

3265
02:08:49,480 --> 02:08:51,280
I... Oh my god.

3266
02:08:51,660 --> 02:08:53,760
I got too cocky.

3267
02:08:54,220 --> 02:08:56,540
I got... I don't need a dodge.

3268
02:08:56,940 --> 02:08:58,480
You're so weak.

3269
02:09:00,600 --> 02:09:02,580
This is the average.

3270
02:09:04,820 --> 02:09:05,440
Okay.

3271
02:09:05,740 --> 02:09:06,740
Okay, now I know.

3272
02:09:06,860 --> 02:09:07,500
I know now.

3273
02:09:07,720 --> 02:09:08,400
I know.

3274
02:09:09,320 --> 02:09:10,480
I know now.

3275
02:09:10,760 --> 02:09:10,760
I know now.

3276
02:09:11,740 --> 02:09:12,780
I understand.

3277
02:09:17,220 --> 02:09:18,280
I understand.

3278
02:09:19,340 --> 02:09:20,980
It's okay, I figured it out.

3279
02:09:21,980 --> 02:09:23,300
I figured it out.

3280
02:09:25,920 --> 02:09:28,520
Okay, I just need to grab this.

3281
02:09:28,820 --> 02:09:30,980
I know it's not a lot, but it's still me.

3282
02:09:33,580 --> 02:09:35,420
I fucking hate you!

3283
02:09:35,620 --> 02:09:36,180
AHHHH!

3284
02:09:44,840 --> 02:09:46,180
Are you serious?

3285
02:09:46,480 --> 02:09:47,340
Are you serious?

3286
02:09:47,540 --> 02:09:48,160
It's teammates!

3287
02:09:48,660 --> 02:09:50,260
He brought his whole squad!

3288
02:09:55,940 --> 02:09:58,660
Okay, okay, wait, I get it now.

3289
02:10:01,500 --> 02:10:04,740
Okay, I'm gonna clear the skellies first.

3290
02:10:04,740 --> 02:10:09,540
I... I'm gonna... I'm gonna clear the skellies.

3291
02:10:12,740 --> 02:10:15,700
He brought... Bro, he brought the homies!

3292
02:10:16,060 --> 02:10:17,240
To the LAN party!

3293
02:10:17,620 --> 02:10:18,660
That's not fair!

3294
02:10:18,880 --> 02:10:20,080
I said 1v1!

3295
02:10:21,560 --> 02:10:22,200
1v1!

3296
02:10:22,460 --> 02:10:23,200
Fox only!

3297
02:10:23,580 --> 02:10:24,440
No items!

3298
02:10:24,720 --> 02:10:25,480
Final destination!

3299
02:10:26,040 --> 02:10:29,460
And then he brought, like, three other people to join him.

3300
02:10:30,400 --> 02:10:32,460
Like, I don't know, I think that's cheating.

3301
02:10:33,180 --> 02:10:35,880
That may or may not be against the rules.

3302
02:10:36,400 --> 02:10:38,320
Where's the ref when you need him?

3303
02:10:38,780 --> 02:10:39,840
I swear!

3304
02:10:40,420 --> 02:10:42,200
I... Are you serious?

3305
02:10:42,740 --> 02:10:43,340
Okay!

3306
02:10:43,800 --> 02:10:45,000
Okay, buddy!

3307
02:10:45,720 --> 02:10:46,320
Okay!

3308
02:10:46,780 --> 02:10:47,280
Okay!

3309
02:10:47,580 --> 02:10:47,920
Okay!

3310
02:10:48,260 --> 02:10:48,440
Okay!

3311
02:10:48,440 --> 02:10:48,560
Okay!

3312
02:10:49,300 --> 02:10:50,180
That's... Okay.

3313
02:10:50,780 --> 02:10:55,240
Like, I don't know about you guys, but I think I need the ref here right now.

3314
02:10:55,240 --> 02:10:57,240
I... I...

3315
02:10:59,240 --> 02:11:01,300
Where the fuck is that ref?

3316
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:11,920
Holy shit!

3317
02:11:13,400 --> 02:11:16,060
He primed the ref!

3318
02:11:16,680 --> 02:11:19,560
The ref is also a skeleton!

3319
02:11:19,560 --> 02:11:22,380
Where the fuck was the casters?

3320
02:11:22,900 --> 02:11:24,280
Why did the casters not

3321
02:11:28,330 --> 02:11:29,110
come...

3322
02:11:30,950 --> 02:11:31,850
So weak!

3323
02:11:32,430 --> 02:11:34,330
He was the ref!

3324
02:11:39,920 --> 02:11:41,440
Please, jellyfish, please!

3325
02:11:41,840 --> 02:11:43,460
Aggro one of them!

3326
02:11:47,160 --> 02:11:48,280
Oh my god, please!

3327
02:11:48,780 --> 02:11:49,720
I... One of them!

3328
02:11:49,840 --> 02:11:50,720
That's all I ask!

3329
02:11:50,980 --> 02:11:51,760
One of them!

3330
02:11:51,920 --> 02:11:53,320
Aggro one of them!

3331
02:11:53,320 --> 02:11:54,100
Just!

3332
02:11:54,100 --> 02:11:55,100
Not him!

3333
02:12:03,180 --> 02:12:03,770
Okay.

3334
02:12:05,380 --> 02:12:06,470
Okay, that's fine.

3335
02:12:09,870 --> 02:12:10,460
Alright.

3336
02:12:19,280 --> 02:12:19,840
Fine!

3337
02:12:20,260 --> 02:12:21,900
That's not fine!

3338
02:12:22,140 --> 02:12:24,840
I don't feel fine anymore!

3339
02:12:34,030 --> 02:12:36,320
You're such a BITCH!

3340
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:37,900
BITCH!

3341
02:12:55,970 --> 02:12:58,170
I can't believe...

3342
02:12:58,170 --> 02:13:01,090
Does he really need all of those abilities?

3343
02:13:01,550 --> 02:13:03,850
He brought, like, four teammates!

3344
02:13:04,110 --> 02:13:06,690
And then he has to have a stun!

3345
02:13:07,150 --> 02:13:08,110
And a grab!

3346
02:13:08,550 --> 02:13:10,270
And, like, 800 attack!

3347
02:13:10,530 --> 02:13:11,910
Does he really need all of that?

3348
02:13:12,150 --> 02:13:14,350
Does he really need all of that?

3349
02:13:14,350 --> 02:13:18,710
Like, he's so weak, by the way!

3350
02:13:19,290 --> 02:13:20,570
He's so weak!

3351
02:13:21,390 --> 02:13:22,750
Like, let's see...

3352
02:13:25,330 --> 02:13:25,890
Oh!

3353
02:13:30,030 --> 02:13:31,230
I hate you!

3354
02:13:31,430 --> 02:13:32,050
I hope...

3355
02:13:32,050 --> 02:13:34,610
I hope you never find love!

3356
02:13:35,150 --> 02:13:38,370
I hope you never find love!

3357
02:13:41,890 --> 02:13:44,230
I swear to god...

3358
02:13:44,230 --> 02:13:45,930
I swear...

3359
02:13:48,620 --> 02:13:50,080
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

3360
02:13:54,300 --> 02:13:56,810
I'm a glass cannon Bill...

3361
02:13:57,320 --> 02:13:57,660
Tiff!

3362
02:13:58,580 --> 02:13:59,960
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

3363
02:14:01,460 --> 02:14:01,910
Okay...

3364
02:14:02,360 --> 02:14:03,100
Okay.

3365
02:14:03,440 --> 02:14:04,740
I-I-I got this.

3366
02:14:05,340 --> 02:14:06,020
Yeah!

3367
02:14:06,580 --> 02:14:07,920
This approach.

3368
02:14:10,460 --> 02:14:13,280
I hope you die alone...

3369
02:14:13,280 --> 02:14:15,140
For the rest of your life!

3370
02:14:15,140 --> 02:14:15,140
Alright.

3371
02:14:18,240 --> 02:14:22,060
The power of friendship goes off.

3372
02:14:24,780 --> 02:14:27,580
Bro, okay, I'm fucking rid of him.

3373
02:14:27,980 --> 02:14:28,440
That's it.

3374
02:14:30,320 --> 02:14:35,680
Oh my god.

3375
02:14:36,240 --> 02:14:37,860
Oh my god.

3376
02:14:38,860 --> 02:14:45,540
Oh my... Okay.

3377
02:14:46,420 --> 02:14:47,100
Guys, please.

3378
02:14:47,220 --> 02:14:49,040
Can someone message or praise one thing?

3379
02:14:49,200 --> 02:14:49,820
One time.

3380
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:51,340
I just need one message of praise.

3381
02:14:51,380 --> 02:14:51,960
That's all I need.

3382
02:14:52,340 --> 02:14:52,480
Please.

3383
02:14:52,600 --> 02:14:53,760
Just one message of praise.

3384
02:14:54,120 --> 02:14:54,280
Please.

3385
02:14:55,020 --> 02:15:01,100
Just... Okay.

3386
02:15:08,820 --> 02:15:09,680
Are you serious?

3387
02:15:09,880 --> 02:15:10,660
Are you serious?

3388
02:15:10,780 --> 02:15:10,980
Okay.

3389
02:15:11,240 --> 02:15:11,560
That's good.

3390
02:15:11,960 --> 02:15:12,240
Please.

3391
02:15:12,320 --> 02:15:13,300
Just one message of praise.

3392
02:15:13,340 --> 02:15:13,940
That's all I need.

3393
02:15:14,240 --> 02:15:14,440
Okay.

3394
02:15:14,440 --> 02:15:14,820
Never mind.

3395
02:15:14,840 --> 02:15:15,260
That's fine.

3396
02:15:16,340 --> 02:15:17,020
That's fine.

3397
02:15:18,620 --> 02:15:19,280
That's fine.

3398
02:15:21,980 --> 02:15:22,980
Oh, thank you.

3399
02:15:23,120 --> 02:15:23,760
I... thanks.

3400
02:15:25,760 --> 02:15:26,880
You guys did it.

3401
02:15:27,040 --> 02:15:27,780
You did it.

3402
02:15:30,540 --> 02:15:32,000
Oh my god.

3403
02:15:33,340 --> 02:15:34,420
Thank you guys.

3404
02:15:35,640 --> 02:15:36,440
It's fine.

3405
02:15:37,600 --> 02:15:38,480
We did it.

3406
02:15:39,680 --> 02:15:41,380
Is that what you wanted, Doki?

3407
02:15:41,660 --> 02:15:42,500
You said one.

3408
02:15:45,700 --> 02:15:46,580
Oh my god.

3409
02:15:46,720 --> 02:15:49,320
I'm trying to be, like, super careful right now.

3410
02:15:49,320 --> 02:15:51,800
Cause... this guy has fucked me up.

3411
02:15:55,800 --> 02:15:56,860
I hate you.

3412
02:15:57,220 --> 02:15:58,060
I hate you.

3413
02:15:58,180 --> 02:15:58,940
I hate you.

3414
02:15:59,080 --> 02:16:00,200
I HATE YOU!

3415
02:16:01,640 --> 02:16:02,360
AHHHHH!

3416
02:16:04,980 --> 02:16:07,880
He just... AHHHHH!

3417
02:16:10,060 --> 02:16:13,500
My TP!

3418
02:16:15,600 --> 02:16:19,060
My T... I roll back ETPs forward!

3419
02:16:19,780 --> 02:16:20,240
I...

3420
02:16:20,240 --> 02:16:24,920
Oh my god.

3421
02:16:24,920 --> 02:16:27,460
I should have rolled forward!

3422
02:16:28,260 --> 02:16:29,760
Oh my god.

3423
02:16:30,180 --> 02:16:32,220
Why did I roll forward?

3424
02:16:32,680 --> 02:16:34,900
Why did I roll backwards?

3425
02:16:40,810 --> 02:16:42,290
Oh my god.

3426
02:16:48,860 --> 02:16:49,760
Doesn't matter.

3427
02:16:49,900 --> 02:16:50,560
I just wanna kill him.

3428
02:16:50,900 --> 02:16:51,960
I just wanna kill him.

3429
02:16:57,790 --> 02:16:58,730
Okay, nice.

3430
02:16:59,530 --> 02:17:00,670
Okay, nice.

3431
02:17:03,770 --> 02:17:04,490
NOOOOO!

3432
02:17:04,670 --> 02:17:06,050
He killed my plan!

3433
02:17:06,530 --> 02:17:08,450
He saw right through me!

3434
02:17:14,810 --> 02:17:16,550
Fuck me and my bros.

3435
02:17:18,230 --> 02:17:20,270
Feeding up this fucking VTuber.

3436
02:17:23,310 --> 02:17:24,130
Okay.

3437
02:17:24,150 --> 02:17:24,610
Okay.

3438
02:17:26,050 --> 02:17:27,990
Alright, slow and steady.

3439
02:17:28,670 --> 02:17:30,210
Slow and steady, Doki.

3440
02:17:31,890 --> 02:17:33,250
Clearly not...

3441
02:17:33,250 --> 02:17:34,090
Too slow!

3442
02:17:34,510 --> 02:17:35,490
Too slow, Doki!

3443
02:17:35,630 --> 02:17:36,070
Too slow!

3444
02:17:41,430 --> 02:17:42,770
I hate you.

3445
02:17:46,660 --> 02:17:47,480
Okay.

3446
02:17:48,800 --> 02:17:49,780
Okay.

3447
02:17:49,780 --> 02:17:50,600
Oh my god.

3448
02:17:52,860 --> 02:17:54,560
Oh my god!

3449
02:18:03,440 --> 02:18:04,020
Okay.

3450
02:18:05,300 --> 02:18:05,820
Okay.

3451
02:18:06,300 --> 02:18:07,180
That's good.

3452
02:18:13,210 --> 02:18:14,060
I hate you.

3453
02:18:14,200 --> 02:18:14,780
I hate you!

3454
02:18:15,150 --> 02:18:15,640
AHHHHH!

3455
02:18:15,900 --> 02:18:16,560
AHHHHH!

3456
02:18:16,760 --> 02:18:16,960
AHHHHH!

3457
02:18:18,480 --> 02:18:19,280
AHHHHH!

3458
02:18:20,600 --> 02:18:21,080
NO!

3459
02:18:21,400 --> 02:18:22,060
No, NO!

3460
02:18:22,060 --> 02:18:22,300
NOOO!

3461
02:18:22,300 --> 02:18:22,960
OH, TANK GOD!

3462
02:18:25,620 --> 02:18:28,000
One fear and it's that fucking move...

3463
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,080
That move has killed me too many times.

3464
02:18:35,960 --> 02:18:36,440
Yes!

3465
02:18:36,440 --> 02:18:38,120
Oh, thank you!

3466
02:18:38,580 --> 02:18:40,440
Oh, thank god!

3467
02:18:40,700 --> 02:18:42,620
Oh, thank god!

3468
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:44,160
We did it!

3469
02:18:44,780 --> 02:18:46,800
Oh my god, we did it!

3470
02:18:46,980 --> 02:18:48,220
Give me this box!

3471
02:18:48,960 --> 02:18:51,340
Give me your fucking treasures!

3472
02:18:52,860 --> 02:18:55,960
Oh, therefore seek- was it- therefore seek- hole!

3473
02:18:55,960 --> 02:18:56,640
Oh, oh, oh!

3474
02:18:58,480 --> 02:18:59,200
That...

3475
02:18:59,920 --> 02:19:01,080
Where did I kill him?

3476
02:19:01,380 --> 02:19:03,460
I killed you right here!

3477
02:19:04,660 --> 02:19:06,460
Oh wait, no, you died here.

3478
02:19:08,980 --> 02:19:09,700
Message.

3479
02:19:13,760 --> 02:19:15,200
First off...

3480
02:19:18,480 --> 02:19:19,940
Corpse... that's right.

3481
02:19:21,880 --> 02:19:23,480
Get out of here!

3482
02:19:23,480 --> 02:19:26,980
Try and bring a fucking gang to a 1v1!

3483
02:19:27,320 --> 02:19:28,240
Get out!

3484
02:19:34,140 --> 02:19:35,800
How dare you!

3485
02:19:37,440 --> 02:19:39,780
I said 1v1!

3486
02:19:42,580 --> 02:19:43,220
Alright.

3487
02:19:44,140 --> 02:19:46,500
I don't know, this guy- I don't wanna fight him.

3488
02:19:46,820 --> 02:19:48,320
He already fucked me up.

3489
02:19:48,520 --> 02:19:49,780
He can have this area.

3490
02:19:51,660 --> 02:19:52,340
Wait, actually.

3491
02:19:52,640 --> 02:19:55,560
You see, I just think I- wait, I might be- I might have enough to level up, actually.

3492
02:19:56,920 --> 02:19:57,100
Wait.

3493
02:19:58,000 --> 02:19:59,780
Get off my horse, and then...

3494
02:20:03,550 --> 02:20:05,330
I might be able to level up my sword.

3495
02:20:08,490 --> 02:20:09,090
And stuff.

3496
02:20:11,930 --> 02:20:12,250
Alright.

3497
02:20:15,510 --> 02:20:15,990
Greetings.

3498
02:20:16,270 --> 02:20:16,570
Hello!

3499
02:20:18,110 --> 02:20:18,890
Oh, yes!

3500
02:20:21,730 --> 02:20:22,210
Okay.

3501
02:20:23,870 --> 02:20:24,830
And then...

3502
02:20:24,830 --> 02:20:26,510
Well, I took you for no matter.

3503
02:20:26,730 --> 02:20:27,770
And say out your arms, then.

3504
02:20:28,430 --> 02:20:29,550
Alright, let's see.

3505
02:20:29,630 --> 02:20:30,070
Do I have enough?

3506
02:20:31,530 --> 02:20:32,490
I need...

3507
02:20:32,910 --> 02:20:34,430
Two more smithing stone.

3508
02:20:34,830 --> 02:20:35,990
How do I get that?

3509
02:20:38,230 --> 02:20:39,090
Two finger?

3510
02:20:39,430 --> 02:20:40,310
It was two fingers.

3511
02:20:40,970 --> 02:20:41,990
Oh, I'm missing one.

3512
02:20:42,770 --> 02:20:43,910
How do I get more?

3513
02:20:56,740 --> 02:20:57,220
What?

3514
02:20:58,160 --> 02:20:59,020
Look at me!

3515
02:20:59,240 --> 02:21:00,080
I'm blinged out!

3516
02:21:02,120 --> 02:21:02,940
Look at me!

3517
02:21:03,160 --> 02:21:04,740
Look how fucking sick I look!

3518
02:21:04,980 --> 02:21:06,840
What do you mean I haven't earned it yet?

3519
02:21:06,840 --> 02:21:09,080
I look so fucking sick!

3520
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:13,280
It says I had to go forward here, but...

3521
02:21:13,580 --> 02:21:14,500
I feel like...

3522
02:21:14,500 --> 02:21:16,660
I don't have the item yet for it.

3523
02:21:16,900 --> 02:21:17,780
So I guess not?

3524
02:21:18,680 --> 02:21:20,880
And this here says I should go forward.

3525
02:21:22,300 --> 02:21:22,640
Woah.

3526
02:21:28,030 --> 02:21:29,670
Wait, talk the fingers?

3527
02:21:30,290 --> 02:21:31,010
Upstairs?

3528
02:21:31,750 --> 02:21:33,610
I have to go upstairs here?

3529
02:21:34,810 --> 02:21:35,530
I

3530
02:21:40,160 --> 02:21:41,580
had my doubts.

3531
02:21:44,680 --> 02:21:46,020
Look at you.

3532
02:21:47,380 --> 02:21:53,000
Only once before have I seen two great runes together.

3533
02:21:54,140 --> 02:21:55,000
Woah!

3534
02:21:56,060 --> 02:21:59,000
The fingers shudder with exuberance.

3535
02:21:59,020 --> 02:22:00,140
Whose fingers is that?

3536
02:22:00,640 --> 02:22:02,860
Fine work, brave tarnished.

3537
02:22:03,800 --> 02:22:05,740
The greater will is pleased.

3538
02:22:07,020 --> 02:22:09,800
You have earned the right to become...

3539
02:22:09,800 --> 02:22:10,800
Me?!

3540
02:22:11,380 --> 02:22:12,100
Me!

3541
02:22:12,620 --> 02:22:16,820
You think that's two fingers?

3542
02:22:16,820 --> 02:22:18,020
Because he has two fingers?

3543
02:22:18,020 --> 02:22:18,180
Two fingers?

3544
02:22:18,580 --> 02:22:19,700
To become Elden Lord.

3545
02:22:20,280 --> 02:22:21,000
And restore...

3546
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:22,780
How do we know it's fingers and not toes?

3547
02:22:23,760 --> 02:22:25,900
The fingers expect...

3548
02:22:25,900 --> 02:22:29,700
As much from you as they do young Gideon.

3549
02:22:31,100 --> 02:22:32,180
Take this.

3550
02:22:33,100 --> 02:22:34,980
A token of farewell.

3551
02:22:36,740 --> 02:22:37,100
Yay!

3552
02:22:37,940 --> 02:22:39,160
Oh, a talisman pouch.

3553
02:22:41,020 --> 02:22:42,880
I would know if they were...

3554
02:22:42,880 --> 02:22:44,980
They could be really, really long toes.

3555
02:22:45,300 --> 02:22:45,980
You don't know that.

3556
02:22:51,800 --> 02:22:52,660
They're not...

3557
02:22:52,660 --> 02:22:54,280
Clearly they're not human toes.

3558
02:22:55,700 --> 02:22:56,360
Yeah, right?

3559
02:22:57,940 --> 02:22:58,900
But like...

3560
02:22:58,900 --> 02:23:00,940
Oh wait, maybe I can go down from here.

3561
02:23:01,240 --> 02:23:02,600
And then go down from here.

3562
02:23:02,660 --> 02:23:03,040
You know what?

3563
02:23:03,040 --> 02:23:04,500
I think I can do it.

3564
02:23:08,900 --> 02:23:10,700
Oh, I can equip more talisman now?

3565
02:23:10,860 --> 02:23:11,220
Oh, nice.

3566
02:23:15,420 --> 02:23:15,900
Alright.

3567
02:23:19,360 --> 02:23:20,300
Oh, wait.

3568
02:23:20,420 --> 02:23:21,240
I think I can do it.

3569
02:23:21,500 --> 02:23:23,280
Remember all those like bats down there?

3570
02:23:24,620 --> 02:23:26,520
I think I can beat the bats.

3571
02:23:29,860 --> 02:23:30,340
Alright.

3572
02:23:30,820 --> 02:23:31,700
Watch this.

3573
02:23:33,540 --> 02:23:35,180
Wait, less people died here.

3574
02:23:52,480 --> 02:23:55,600
Guys, there were a lot of bats down there.

3575
02:23:56,520 --> 02:23:58,540
Guys, bats caught me.

3576
02:23:58,800 --> 02:23:59,040
Guys.

3577
02:23:59,400 --> 02:23:59,820
Guys.

3578
02:24:00,080 --> 02:24:01,480
It was the bats.

3579
02:24:07,860 --> 02:24:08,540
Guys.

3580
02:24:08,540 --> 02:24:10,260
I think it was caught.

3581
02:24:10,460 --> 02:24:11,260
Oh my God.

3582
02:24:11,580 --> 02:24:11,780
I...

3583
02:24:11,780 --> 02:24:14,820
I got sworn by all those bats, guys.

3584
02:24:15,500 --> 02:24:16,660
Holy shit.

3585
02:24:17,180 --> 02:24:18,340
It was crazy.

3586
02:24:18,520 --> 02:24:20,800
I did not expect to see it.

3587
02:24:21,320 --> 02:24:22,660
That many bats.

3588
02:24:22,880 --> 02:24:23,920
Oh my God.

3589
02:24:23,920 --> 02:24:25,220
I did not mean to do that.

3590
02:24:25,540 --> 02:24:25,960
I...

3591
02:24:26,540 --> 02:24:28,140
I got kicked off.

3592
02:24:28,300 --> 02:24:32,160
I got off my horse and it pushed me into the cliff.

3593
02:24:32,480 --> 02:24:35,360
My horse literally pushed me back down.

3594
02:24:38,400 --> 02:24:39,040
Okay.

3595
02:24:40,760 --> 02:24:41,360
Those...

3596
02:24:41,360 --> 02:24:41,840
Sorry.

3597
02:24:42,040 --> 02:24:45,920
Those gosh darn bats pushed me down into the bat hole.

3598
02:24:48,800 --> 02:24:49,860
No horse.

3599
02:24:50,100 --> 02:24:50,500
Alright.

3600
02:24:50,520 --> 02:24:51,960
We're not going that way.

3601
02:24:52,520 --> 02:24:52,980
We're not.

3602
02:24:53,260 --> 02:24:53,760
Alright.

3603
02:24:53,880 --> 02:24:55,120
We're gonna figure out how to get there.

3604
02:24:56,580 --> 02:24:59,740
We're gonna figure out a different parkour route.

3605
02:25:04,800 --> 02:25:05,680
Right here?

3606
02:25:10,240 --> 02:25:12,260
How the fuck did these guys die?

3607
02:25:18,140 --> 02:25:19,100
You sinking?

3608
02:25:20,200 --> 02:25:20,900
Oh.

3609
02:25:21,340 --> 02:25:21,680
Oh.

3610
02:25:25,890 --> 02:25:27,440
You thought about it.

3611
02:25:27,660 --> 02:25:29,480
But it didn't work out, guys.

3612
02:25:33,840 --> 02:25:34,860
Well done.

3613
02:25:35,240 --> 02:25:35,620
Why?

3614
02:25:37,370 --> 02:25:38,320
Praise the jumping.

3615
02:25:39,060 --> 02:25:40,200
First off, well done.

3616
02:25:40,360 --> 02:25:40,780
Oh, here?

3617
02:25:43,370 --> 02:25:44,000
Wait, why?

3618
02:25:44,480 --> 02:25:46,020
Is there a parkour here?

3619
02:25:46,500 --> 02:25:46,920
Is there a parkour here?

3620
02:25:46,920 --> 02:25:48,280
And that's why people are like, good job?

3621
02:25:48,540 --> 02:25:51,080
Oh, I guess like they went from here to here.

3622
02:25:53,920 --> 02:25:54,400
Where?

3623
02:25:54,420 --> 02:25:55,040
Look for the church?

3624
02:25:55,960 --> 02:25:57,220
I see no church.

3625
02:25:59,520 --> 02:26:01,320
I assume it's here to here.

3626
02:26:01,440 --> 02:26:03,200
And everybody's like, good job you did it.

3627
02:26:04,860 --> 02:26:06,460
I see no church anywhere.

3628
02:26:13,210 --> 02:26:14,110
Is there a church yet?

3629
02:26:14,190 --> 02:26:14,910
Oh, I see it!

3630
02:26:15,130 --> 02:26:15,830
Is that a church?

3631
02:26:19,830 --> 02:26:20,750
Wow, rune art?

3632
02:26:28,180 --> 02:26:28,700
It's so?

3633
02:26:29,420 --> 02:26:30,720
Alright, let's try to get a church.

3634
02:26:31,440 --> 02:26:34,720
We might need to increase our flask.

3635
02:26:36,140 --> 02:26:37,500
Like, we definitely need to increase it.

3636
02:26:37,960 --> 02:26:39,900
Our shit is so fucking weak right now.

3637
02:26:43,740 --> 02:26:44,920
Oh, there's a grace here.

3638
02:26:45,020 --> 02:26:45,160
Wait.

3639
02:26:45,400 --> 02:26:46,760
I've been to that grace before.

3640
02:26:47,240 --> 02:26:48,220
I'm pretty sure.

3641
02:26:48,440 --> 02:26:48,640
Right?

3642
02:26:48,780 --> 02:26:49,300
No, I haven't.

3643
02:26:49,300 --> 02:26:50,260
Oh no, I haven't!

3644
02:26:50,620 --> 02:26:51,880
No, this is a new area.

3645
02:26:57,200 --> 02:26:57,640
Alright.

3646
02:26:58,560 --> 02:26:59,000
Yay!

3647
02:27:01,100 --> 02:27:03,180
Guys, I'm not going back with my souls.

3648
02:27:03,580 --> 02:27:04,480
I've given up.

3649
02:27:06,340 --> 02:27:07,960
Look, it was just a thousand.

3650
02:27:08,140 --> 02:27:08,900
I can get it back.

3651
02:27:10,360 --> 02:27:12,480
Is there like, a flask here then?

3652
02:27:13,060 --> 02:27:14,080
Since it's a church?

3653
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:18,440
Oh!

3654
02:27:18,680 --> 02:27:19,600
Wait, there's another grace.

3655
02:27:20,040 --> 02:27:20,400
Oh wait, no.

3656
02:27:20,460 --> 02:27:21,380
I was in this grace.

3657
02:27:23,860 --> 02:27:25,800
It was in front of me this entire time.

3658
02:27:29,120 --> 02:27:29,880
There you go.

3659
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:30,640
Sacred tear.

3660
02:27:31,080 --> 02:27:32,340
Ron's like, oh look!

3661
02:27:32,500 --> 02:27:33,180
I found it!

3662
02:27:33,640 --> 02:27:35,520
Wait, I was here.

3663
02:27:39,490 --> 02:27:40,050
Okay.

3664
02:27:41,670 --> 02:27:42,570
Yes, please.

3665
02:27:46,850 --> 02:27:47,410
Alright.

3666
02:27:47,810 --> 02:27:48,870
Guess we head down here.

3667
02:27:50,850 --> 02:27:51,410
Yeah.

3668
02:27:51,690 --> 02:27:53,230
This should take us downstairs now.

3669
02:27:56,980 --> 02:27:58,140
Oh, there's a person!

3670
02:27:59,400 --> 02:28:00,100
Something incredible?

3671
02:28:00,900 --> 02:28:01,800
This guy?

3672
02:28:03,090 --> 02:28:04,080
Why is he incredible?

3673
02:28:04,980 --> 02:28:05,660
What do you need?

3674
02:28:06,100 --> 02:28:07,280
I don't want any trouble.

3675
02:28:09,440 --> 02:28:11,560
Does he have a...

3676
02:28:11,560 --> 02:28:14,740
No, he's not that good.

3677
02:28:18,540 --> 02:28:20,370
Not really what I need right now.

3678
02:28:21,730 --> 02:28:22,330
I see.

3679
02:28:22,790 --> 02:28:23,390
Donkey.

3680
02:28:23,390 --> 02:28:23,750
A key.

3681
02:28:24,330 --> 02:28:24,850
Dog.

3682
02:28:32,280 --> 02:28:33,340
I like that.

3683
02:28:36,140 --> 02:28:36,660
Wait.

3684
02:28:41,480 --> 02:28:42,340
Is there...

3685
02:28:42,340 --> 02:28:43,200
Wait, what is it?

3686
02:28:46,580 --> 02:28:47,100
Concepts?

3687
02:28:49,220 --> 02:28:51,400
Is a dog a concept, guys?

3688
02:28:51,760 --> 02:28:52,640
Wait, wait.

3689
02:28:52,740 --> 02:28:53,480
Did that say frog?

3690
02:28:53,600 --> 02:28:54,120
Oh, it said rod.

3691
02:28:54,240 --> 02:28:55,300
I thought that said rat.

3692
02:28:55,300 --> 02:28:56,160
Wait.

3693
02:28:56,660 --> 02:28:56,680
Dog.

3694
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:58,340
Dog's not an enemy!

3695
02:29:00,940 --> 02:29:01,460
Dog.

3696
02:29:02,060 --> 02:29:02,560
Wait.

3697
02:29:02,880 --> 02:29:03,740
Actually...

3698
02:29:04,800 --> 02:29:06,340
Dog friend!

3699
02:29:09,800 --> 02:29:10,840
Bird.

3700
02:29:11,540 --> 02:29:12,060
Bird!

3701
02:29:19,820 --> 02:29:21,040
Seed ahead.

3702
02:29:21,340 --> 02:29:22,020
Therefore, try.

3703
02:29:22,980 --> 02:29:23,800
Campsite ahead.

3704
02:29:24,040 --> 02:29:25,080
Therefore, time for tranquility.

3705
02:29:25,760 --> 02:29:26,360
Merchant?

3706
02:29:27,360 --> 02:29:27,840
Friendly?

3707
02:29:28,360 --> 02:29:29,580
Fucking liars.

3708
02:29:31,040 --> 02:29:32,100
Oh, shit!

3709
02:29:34,060 --> 02:29:35,280
What the fuck?

3710
02:29:35,480 --> 02:29:36,760
Why are they so strong?

3711
02:29:40,240 --> 02:29:41,860
Okay, I was not ready for that.

3712
02:29:42,180 --> 02:29:43,820
I didn't realize they were so strong.

3713
02:29:46,640 --> 02:29:49,080
It's like they were made out of rocks or some shit.

3714
02:29:51,860 --> 02:29:52,900
Jesus Christ!

3715
02:29:53,340 --> 02:29:54,240
Oh my God!

3716
02:29:54,640 --> 02:29:57,180
What is wrong with your skin, buddy?

3717
02:30:02,390 --> 02:30:04,990
It's like their skin is made out of rocks.

3718
02:30:06,030 --> 02:30:07,950
Could this be a merchant?

3719
02:30:08,770 --> 02:30:10,550
Could this be a merchant?

3720
02:30:10,910 --> 02:30:11,450
Merchant?

3721
02:30:15,690 --> 02:30:16,650
In the mines.

3722
02:30:17,030 --> 02:30:17,170
Yeah.

3723
02:30:18,170 --> 02:30:19,550
Wait, they're like mine people?

3724
02:30:19,990 --> 02:30:20,590
What the fuck?

3725
02:30:20,710 --> 02:30:21,890
Why don't I get like...

3726
02:30:21,890 --> 02:30:24,610
Why didn't I get like free rocks from them?

3727
02:30:25,570 --> 02:30:27,310
I deserve free rocks.

3728
02:30:30,170 --> 02:30:32,230
First they mine, then they craft.

3729
02:30:35,840 --> 02:30:36,480
Let's heal.

3730
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:37,840
I'll fight him.

3731
02:30:39,280 --> 02:30:40,140
Oh, nevermind.

3732
02:30:40,300 --> 02:30:41,980
I wanted my friend to fight him for me.

3733
02:30:42,180 --> 02:30:42,760
But nevermind.

3734
02:30:44,820 --> 02:30:45,260
Um...

3735
02:30:46,780 --> 02:30:47,580
Okay, that's fine.

3736
02:30:47,720 --> 02:30:47,960
Oh!

3737
02:30:48,420 --> 02:30:49,760
That's not fine, that's not fine.

3738
02:30:52,600 --> 02:30:53,660
So I can do this again.

3739
02:30:55,080 --> 02:30:55,520
Okay.

3740
02:30:58,280 --> 02:30:59,000
Jesus.

3741
02:30:59,300 --> 02:30:59,560
All right.

3742
02:30:59,740 --> 02:31:00,340
That's fine.

3743
02:31:00,500 --> 02:31:01,040
That's fine.

3744
02:31:01,220 --> 02:31:01,960
That's fine.

3745
02:31:02,500 --> 02:31:03,680
I have heals.

3746
02:31:06,580 --> 02:31:07,300
Woo!

3747
02:31:09,380 --> 02:31:10,940
He blocked it!

3748
02:31:11,600 --> 02:31:13,200
That should be illegal.

3749
02:31:18,200 --> 02:31:19,420
Oh my God.

3750
02:31:21,280 --> 02:31:21,980
Okay.

3751
02:31:24,200 --> 02:31:25,660
Why aren't you bleeding?

3752
02:31:25,940 --> 02:31:26,680
Why are...

3753
02:31:26,680 --> 02:31:26,960
No!

3754
02:31:27,660 --> 02:31:28,760
I got greedy.

3755
02:31:28,980 --> 02:31:29,740
I got greedy.

3756
02:31:30,040 --> 02:31:30,300
Ah!

3757
02:31:32,080 --> 02:31:33,760
I got greedy.

3758
02:31:35,140 --> 02:31:36,940
I was like, he's one.

3759
02:31:37,080 --> 02:31:37,740
I'm one.

3760
02:31:37,900 --> 02:31:38,820
I'm faster.

3761
02:31:39,160 --> 02:31:40,400
I'll be easy.

3762
02:31:41,220 --> 02:31:42,760
Guess it wasn't easy.

3763
02:31:43,160 --> 02:31:44,360
It wasn't.

3764
02:31:46,700 --> 02:31:47,060
Oh!

3765
02:31:47,320 --> 02:31:49,460
Why am I always so greedy?

3766
02:31:51,400 --> 02:31:53,280
I can't help it!

3767
02:31:54,820 --> 02:31:55,660
How's late?

3768
02:31:55,920 --> 02:31:56,840
I'm faster.

3769
02:32:00,140 --> 02:32:01,300
I'm Tanya.

3770
02:32:01,720 --> 02:32:03,660
I have less clothes on.

3771
02:32:03,800 --> 02:32:04,780
I'm more aerodynamic.

3772
02:32:07,680 --> 02:32:10,720
This is a greedy talk about in the Bible.

3773
02:32:14,880 --> 02:32:15,940
Okay, now...

3774
02:32:15,940 --> 02:32:16,540
Oh, thank you guys.

3775
02:32:16,780 --> 02:32:17,220
Thank you.

3776
02:32:17,220 --> 02:32:18,560
I think I just...

3777
02:32:18,560 --> 02:32:20,260
I think you're that delayed.

3778
02:32:22,420 --> 02:32:23,560
Alright, he wins.

3779
02:32:24,120 --> 02:32:24,780
Hey, what's these?

3780
02:32:25,200 --> 02:32:25,980
Hey, what are these?

3781
02:32:27,720 --> 02:32:28,880
What are those though?

3782
02:32:30,960 --> 02:32:31,760
Wait, I...

3783
02:32:31,760 --> 02:32:33,300
I think I can take him though.

3784
02:32:33,700 --> 02:32:35,280
I think I can take him.

3785
02:32:36,420 --> 02:32:37,420
I have an idea.

3786
02:32:45,670 --> 02:32:47,250
He can jump?

3787
02:32:49,350 --> 02:32:51,070
Okay, but can he do it again?

3788
02:32:54,410 --> 02:32:55,470
Oh shit!

3789
02:32:55,730 --> 02:32:56,450
Oh shit!

3790
02:32:58,530 --> 02:32:59,630
Oh shit!

3791
02:33:00,370 --> 02:33:01,090
Oh shit!

3792
02:33:01,910 --> 02:33:02,610
Okay.

3793
02:33:06,310 --> 02:33:07,010
Oh my god.

3794
02:33:07,130 --> 02:33:08,090
He can't jump forever.

3795
02:33:10,090 --> 02:33:11,310
I knew you can.

3796
02:33:14,890 --> 02:33:15,530
That's right.

3797
02:33:17,650 --> 02:33:18,310
That's okay.

3798
02:33:18,690 --> 02:33:19,170
That's okay.

3799
02:33:24,350 --> 02:33:24,970
That's okay.

3800
02:33:26,330 --> 02:33:26,870
That's okay.

3801
02:33:26,930 --> 02:33:27,970
I still have the hot ground.

3802
02:33:30,050 --> 02:33:31,210
I still have it.

3803
02:33:38,930 --> 02:33:40,650
I figured it out.

3804
02:33:41,230 --> 02:33:42,570
I'm going to start diving.

3805
02:33:43,310 --> 02:33:43,910
Oh.

3806
02:33:45,610 --> 02:33:46,210
Yeah.

3807
02:33:50,640 --> 02:33:51,440
That's right.

3808
02:33:52,040 --> 02:33:52,720
Oh shit.

3809
02:33:54,100 --> 02:33:54,700
That's...

3810
02:33:54,700 --> 02:33:55,020
Oh shit!

3811
02:33:55,480 --> 02:33:56,080
Please!

3812
02:33:56,340 --> 02:33:56,960
He's one hit!

3813
02:33:57,160 --> 02:33:57,460
Please!

3814
02:33:57,640 --> 02:33:58,560
Let me be free greedy!

3815
02:33:58,720 --> 02:33:58,900
Please!

3816
02:34:02,140 --> 02:34:03,060
Oh my god.

3817
02:34:03,320 --> 02:34:04,000
Oh my god.

3818
02:34:04,240 --> 02:34:04,460
Oh my god.

3819
02:34:04,460 --> 02:34:05,400
I don't trust myself.

3820
02:34:08,260 --> 02:34:08,820
Okay.

3821
02:34:16,040 --> 02:34:17,280
My high ground!

3822
02:34:17,600 --> 02:34:18,860
My high ground!

3823
02:34:20,360 --> 02:34:20,920
Okay.

3824
02:34:21,740 --> 02:34:23,160
He has to come down.

3825
02:34:23,340 --> 02:34:25,680
And when he comes down, I go back up.

3826
02:34:26,280 --> 02:34:27,040
There we go.

3827
02:34:28,500 --> 02:34:31,360
When he comes down, I just have to go back up.

3828
02:34:32,180 --> 02:34:33,160
There we go!

3829
02:34:33,340 --> 02:34:34,120
I did it!

3830
02:34:34,740 --> 02:34:36,840
The power of high ground!

3831
02:34:37,080 --> 02:34:39,480
And all I got is 400 points!

3832
02:34:39,800 --> 02:34:40,340
Let's go!

3833
02:34:41,640 --> 02:34:42,640
Let's go!

3834
02:34:44,050 --> 02:34:45,480
You're at Bumbreed Island.

3835
02:34:45,820 --> 02:34:46,600
What is that?

3836
02:34:46,820 --> 02:34:48,380
That seems very dangerous.

3837
02:34:48,680 --> 02:34:49,800
I'm not gonna...

3838
02:34:50,360 --> 02:34:52,480
That seems like it'll explode.

3839
02:34:52,860 --> 02:34:53,490
It's very...

3840
02:34:54,100 --> 02:34:55,220
What's the word?

3841
02:34:56,440 --> 02:34:59,420
It feels very explodey.

3842
02:35:05,850 --> 02:35:06,650
Oh no.

3843
02:35:06,770 --> 02:35:07,870
I can tell that he respawns.

3844
02:35:08,210 --> 02:35:09,650
He looks very respawnable.

3845
02:35:10,410 --> 02:35:12,830
He really did look very respawnable.

3846
02:35:13,470 --> 02:35:13,950
So don't worry.

3847
02:35:14,090 --> 02:35:14,350
I know.

3848
02:35:20,140 --> 02:35:20,780
Alright.

3849
02:35:22,900 --> 02:35:23,400
Oh!

3850
02:35:23,660 --> 02:35:23,920
Yeah.

3851
02:35:25,180 --> 02:35:25,820
Loot.

3852
02:35:26,320 --> 02:35:26,920
Loot, loot.

3853
02:35:30,700 --> 02:35:31,460
Is that Grace?

3854
02:35:31,960 --> 02:35:32,900
It is.

3855
02:35:33,560 --> 02:35:34,140
Nice.

3856
02:35:39,180 --> 02:35:41,780
Yeah, it looked very, like, explodable.

3857
02:35:42,380 --> 02:35:44,700
It's like a pimple that's about to pop.

3858
02:35:48,430 --> 02:35:48,890
Okay.

3859
02:35:50,990 --> 02:35:52,010
There's a mine?

3860
02:35:55,590 --> 02:35:56,930
Oh, a smithing stone.

3861
02:35:56,930 --> 02:35:57,590
I need that.

3862
02:35:58,870 --> 02:36:00,670
Yeah, it's ready to go kablooey.

3863
02:36:01,870 --> 02:36:02,930
That be a river?

3864
02:36:07,630 --> 02:36:09,450
Do I climb up from the Grace?

3865
02:36:09,870 --> 02:36:10,150
Like...

3866
02:36:10,150 --> 02:36:11,110
Oh, there it is!

3867
02:36:11,290 --> 02:36:12,230
Oh, I didn't see the ladder.

3868
02:36:13,430 --> 02:36:14,790
Alright, ladder time.

3869
02:36:21,550 --> 02:36:22,470
Up I go.

3870
02:36:23,050 --> 02:36:23,850
Up ladder.

3871
02:36:25,810 --> 02:36:26,650
Ladder up.

3872
02:36:33,740 --> 02:36:35,260
Oh, I forgot I put my lantern...

3873
02:36:35,260 --> 02:36:36,100
Is my lantern on?

3874
02:36:36,460 --> 02:36:37,740
I don't think it is.

3875
02:36:39,900 --> 02:36:40,600
There you go.

3876
02:36:41,680 --> 02:36:42,020
There you go.

3877
02:36:42,020 --> 02:36:43,120
Yeah, I forgot I had that.

3878
02:36:43,860 --> 02:36:44,420
What the fuck?

3879
02:36:44,580 --> 02:36:44,940
That's a tumor.

3880
02:36:45,160 --> 02:36:45,680
What the fuck?

3881
02:36:45,820 --> 02:36:46,360
That's a tumor!

3882
02:36:47,300 --> 02:36:48,160
I'm cured cancer.

3883
02:36:50,220 --> 02:36:51,220
Don't worry, guys.

3884
02:36:51,720 --> 02:36:52,700
I got it.

3885
02:36:55,460 --> 02:36:58,280
Cause we all know that there's only one tumor.

3886
02:37:02,490 --> 02:37:02,970
Alright.

3887
02:37:03,210 --> 02:37:05,350
Oh, I can get smithing stone here.

3888
02:37:06,630 --> 02:37:07,110
Right?

3889
02:37:08,070 --> 02:37:10,950
Okay, if I don't bother him, it should be fine.

3890
02:37:12,730 --> 02:37:14,370
I'm pretty sure, like, he doesn't care.

3891
02:37:15,750 --> 02:37:16,310
Yeah.

3892
02:37:16,670 --> 02:37:17,290
Okay, that's good.

3893
02:37:18,150 --> 02:37:19,950
Cause he's way too tanky.

3894
02:37:23,440 --> 02:37:25,080
I just won't bother him.

3895
02:37:30,920 --> 02:37:32,620
As long as they don't care, it's fine.

3896
02:37:33,220 --> 02:37:34,060
Beware of left.

3897
02:37:36,240 --> 02:37:37,060
That guy?

3898
02:37:43,830 --> 02:37:44,390
Oh.

3899
02:37:44,710 --> 02:37:45,450
What the fuck?

3900
02:37:47,950 --> 02:37:48,810
Yeah.

3901
02:37:51,190 --> 02:37:52,490
Liar ahead?

3902
02:37:54,370 --> 02:37:55,870
Beware of poison.

3903
02:37:56,150 --> 02:37:56,630
Wait, what?

3904
02:37:58,150 --> 02:37:59,610
Who has poison?

3905
02:38:03,750 --> 02:38:05,270
I don't think this is...

3906
02:38:05,270 --> 02:38:05,390
Oh.

3907
02:38:27,590 --> 02:38:28,450
Okay.

3908
02:38:28,890 --> 02:38:30,090
I deserve that.

3909
02:38:30,370 --> 02:38:31,510
I really do.

3910
02:38:32,510 --> 02:38:32,850
I...

3911
02:38:35,190 --> 02:38:36,710
I deserve that.

3912
02:38:36,970 --> 02:38:37,430
I...

3913
02:38:37,430 --> 02:38:38,290
It was...

3914
02:38:38,290 --> 02:38:39,790
It was right there.

3915
02:38:40,210 --> 02:38:41,770
Oh my god!

3916
02:38:42,790 --> 02:38:43,810
How many...

3917
02:38:52,780 --> 02:38:54,540
Oh my god, I...

3918
02:38:54,540 --> 02:38:56,340
I'm already poisoned.

3919
02:38:56,340 --> 02:38:57,100
I don't know what...

3920
02:38:57,100 --> 02:38:59,220
Are you gonna give me a bestos or some shit?

3921
02:38:59,360 --> 02:39:00,040
Like, it's...

3922
02:39:00,040 --> 02:39:00,260
Okay.

3923
02:39:00,580 --> 02:39:01,000
That's...

3924
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:03,020
I'm already poisoned.

3925
02:39:03,820 --> 02:39:05,780
Now you're gonna give me a bestos?

3926
02:39:07,140 --> 02:39:07,780
Yay!

3927
02:39:11,720 --> 02:39:12,880
I'm poisoned.

3928
02:39:13,100 --> 02:39:14,740
And I have lung cancer.

3929
02:39:14,980 --> 02:39:15,460
Let's go.

3930
02:39:15,460 --> 02:39:15,620
Oh.

3931
02:39:18,260 --> 02:39:19,800
Wait, I missed the stone?

3932
02:39:25,300 --> 02:39:27,180
Stone in poison room?

3933
02:39:27,620 --> 02:39:28,180
Where?

3934
02:39:37,540 --> 02:39:38,280
These?

3935
02:39:39,300 --> 02:39:40,040
Oh!

3936
02:39:40,980 --> 02:39:42,260
Oh, these are...

3937
02:39:42,260 --> 02:39:43,260
Oh, I didn't realize.

3938
02:39:43,260 --> 02:39:44,880
I thought they were just decorations.

3939
02:39:48,420 --> 02:39:48,940
Alright.

3940
02:39:49,260 --> 02:39:49,340
Okay.

3941
02:39:49,400 --> 02:39:51,040
Now that I know the yellow rocks...

3942
02:39:51,040 --> 02:39:51,640
Alright.

3943
02:39:51,920 --> 02:39:52,560
Part of it.

3944
02:39:59,120 --> 02:39:59,640
Alright.

3945
02:39:59,880 --> 02:40:00,160
Nice.

3946
02:40:00,260 --> 02:40:00,880
Wait, what the fuck?

3947
02:40:01,360 --> 02:40:02,700
That guy like dropped down there.

3948
02:40:07,480 --> 02:40:08,000
Okay.

3949
02:40:08,140 --> 02:40:08,620
I'm a little...

3950
02:40:08,620 --> 02:40:09,820
This is very high up.

3951
02:40:10,400 --> 02:40:12,760
This is very, very high up.

3952
02:40:18,910 --> 02:40:19,950
Try holy.

3953
02:40:22,230 --> 02:40:23,890
Striking required ahead?

3954
02:40:24,390 --> 02:40:24,850
Which one?

3955
02:40:30,400 --> 02:40:32,000
They seem like nice guys.

3956
02:40:32,200 --> 02:40:33,060
Oh, except for that guy.

3957
02:40:33,180 --> 02:40:34,440
That guy does not like me.

3958
02:40:37,060 --> 02:40:39,140
Is he slowly walking towards me?

3959
02:40:40,440 --> 02:40:42,040
I think he is.

3960
02:40:43,720 --> 02:40:46,020
I need magic or strike damage?

3961
02:40:46,260 --> 02:40:46,540
Do I...

3962
02:40:46,540 --> 02:40:47,680
I don't have either of that.

3963
02:40:52,060 --> 02:40:53,160
What is...

3964
02:40:53,160 --> 02:40:54,680
What is a strike thing?

3965
02:40:57,020 --> 02:40:58,980
I don't think I have either of that.

3966
02:41:04,730 --> 02:41:06,630
Is there like a material for it?

3967
02:41:09,650 --> 02:41:10,170
Maze?

3968
02:41:11,650 --> 02:41:12,170
Oh!

3969
02:41:12,410 --> 02:41:13,190
Does the axe help?

3970
02:41:15,890 --> 02:41:16,790
I have these.

3971
02:41:27,120 --> 02:41:28,160
Look under...

3972
02:41:28,160 --> 02:41:28,360
Oh!

3973
02:41:28,560 --> 02:41:29,380
Oh, there it is!

3974
02:41:29,580 --> 02:41:29,740
Oh!

3975
02:41:30,040 --> 02:41:30,880
I'll just use this.

3976
02:41:35,200 --> 02:41:35,720
Alright.

3977
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:38,100
It's flailing time.

3978
02:41:48,250 --> 02:41:48,970
Bonk!

3979
02:41:50,670 --> 02:41:51,330
There we go.

3980
02:41:53,150 --> 02:41:53,870
Does anything notice?

3981
02:41:54,350 --> 02:41:54,730
No.

3982
02:41:54,910 --> 02:41:55,410
Okay, that's cool.

3983
02:41:57,210 --> 02:41:57,750
Yay!

3984
02:41:58,350 --> 02:41:58,750
Freestyle!

3985
02:42:00,630 --> 02:42:01,770
Okay, nice.

3986
02:42:03,690 --> 02:42:05,330
Works like a charm.

3987
02:42:05,610 --> 02:42:05,810
Yay!

3988
02:42:06,050 --> 02:42:06,810
Blunt Trauma!

3989
02:42:07,110 --> 02:42:07,590
Let's go!

3990
02:42:10,850 --> 02:42:12,310
Works every time.

3991
02:42:13,550 --> 02:42:14,050
Oh, wait.

3992
02:42:14,110 --> 02:42:14,790
There's something up here.

3993
02:42:16,130 --> 02:42:17,330
Nothing to see here.

3994
02:42:20,750 --> 02:42:21,550
Think they...

3995
02:42:21,550 --> 02:42:22,410
You're bad people?

3996
02:42:26,210 --> 02:42:27,250
Oh, they're just sleeping.

3997
02:42:27,530 --> 02:42:27,970
Okay, nice.

3998
02:42:29,490 --> 02:42:29,890
Ah!

3999
02:42:31,390 --> 02:42:31,650
Ah!

4000
02:42:38,940 --> 02:42:39,340
Ah!

4001
02:42:39,880 --> 02:42:40,280
What bad

4002
02:42:44,050 --> 02:42:44,910
message are broken!

4003
02:42:45,170 --> 02:42:45,670
That's fine.

4004
02:42:45,810 --> 02:42:46,030
That's fine.

4005
02:42:46,450 --> 02:42:46,730
That's fine.

4006
02:42:46,830 --> 02:42:47,170
I'm okay.

4007
02:42:47,170 --> 02:42:47,710
I'm okay.

4008
02:42:47,750 --> 02:42:48,150
I'm okay.

4009
02:42:49,110 --> 02:42:49,990
I'm okay.

4010
02:42:50,090 --> 02:42:51,070
I'm okay.

4011
02:42:51,070 --> 02:42:51,470
I'm okay.

4012
02:42:51,950 --> 02:42:52,550
I'm okay.

4013
02:42:56,890 --> 02:42:57,490
Alright.

4014
02:43:01,990 --> 02:43:03,970
These fuckers are actually so annoying.

4015
02:43:04,290 --> 02:43:06,410
These actual fuckers are so annoying.

4016
02:43:06,750 --> 02:43:08,090
This is my last blast.

4017
02:43:08,450 --> 02:43:09,410
Are you serious?

4018
02:43:09,590 --> 02:43:10,430
Are you fucking...

4019
02:43:10,430 --> 02:43:11,370
Oh my god!

4020
02:43:11,610 --> 02:43:13,570
That's instant blood blast!

4021
02:43:16,910 --> 02:43:17,930
That's fine.

4022
02:43:18,830 --> 02:43:20,830
Why is it always tree?

4023
02:43:21,990 --> 02:43:24,050
I didn't know they do...

4024
02:43:24,050 --> 02:43:24,870
Oh my god!

4025
02:43:25,110 --> 02:43:26,850
You're still alive?!

4026
02:43:27,710 --> 02:43:28,290
Okay.

4027
02:43:28,690 --> 02:43:29,170
That's fine.

4028
02:43:30,310 --> 02:43:31,250
Everything is fine.

4029
02:43:36,330 --> 02:43:37,050
Okay.

4030
02:43:39,330 --> 02:43:40,410
Explosion ahead.

4031
02:43:41,390 --> 02:43:42,750
I like the sound of that.

4032
02:43:44,030 --> 02:43:44,990
Oh my god!

4033
02:43:45,090 --> 02:43:45,850
That's what they meant!

4034
02:43:46,010 --> 02:43:46,790
That's what they...

4035
02:43:51,450 --> 02:43:54,750
Why is this not the first message?!

4036
02:43:57,130 --> 02:43:58,130
Why is...

4037
02:43:58,130 --> 02:43:58,890
Okay, poor.

4038
02:44:03,990 --> 02:44:04,790
That's it.

4039
02:44:04,930 --> 02:44:05,690
I'm mad.

4040
02:44:06,210 --> 02:44:08,050
I'm mad.

4041
02:44:11,050 --> 02:44:11,330
I'm mad.

4042
02:44:11,430 --> 02:44:12,690
I'm mad.

4043
02:44:16,260 --> 02:44:17,020
I'm mad.

4044
02:44:17,020 --> 02:44:17,400
I'm mad.

4045
02:44:17,400 --> 02:44:18,280
Right here.

4046
02:44:22,160 --> 02:44:23,380
Where is it?

4047
02:44:28,030 --> 02:44:28,790
Liar.

4048
02:44:32,150 --> 02:44:35,330
And now, for here, I'll put...

4049
02:44:38,930 --> 02:44:40,230
Where is it?

4050
02:44:41,390 --> 02:44:42,710
Close quarter battle.

4051
02:44:45,870 --> 02:44:47,030
There we go.

4052
02:44:47,270 --> 02:44:48,210
There we go.

4053
02:44:48,210 --> 02:44:48,250
There we go.

4054
02:44:48,370 --> 02:44:49,970
Now everyone will suffer.

4055
02:44:58,090 --> 02:44:58,810
Nice.

4056
02:44:58,810 --> 02:44:59,930
I got Gris.

4057
02:45:00,690 --> 02:45:02,670
Polluting the timeline.

4058
02:45:06,310 --> 02:45:09,870
Now they will know which one's telling the truth.

4059
02:45:09,870 --> 02:45:12,450
And which one's telling the lie.

4060
02:45:14,610 --> 02:45:15,810
As it should be.

4061
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:20,680
Okay.

4062
02:45:21,040 --> 02:45:22,760
I think I should have enough for the sword now.

4063
02:45:31,860 --> 02:45:32,540
Alright.

4064
02:45:33,260 --> 02:45:34,500
I should have enough.

4065
02:45:35,920 --> 02:45:36,940
Oh, okay.

4066
02:45:37,060 --> 02:45:37,700
I unequipped it.

4067
02:45:40,200 --> 02:45:40,880
Alright.

4068
02:45:41,820 --> 02:45:44,500
One elephant lord speaks only the truth.

4069
02:45:44,940 --> 02:45:46,220
The other one lies.

4070
02:45:48,740 --> 02:45:49,500
Yay!

4071
02:45:50,520 --> 02:45:51,560
What do I need?

4072
02:45:52,320 --> 02:45:54,100
Four level three smithing stones.

4073
02:45:57,500 --> 02:46:00,220
Guys, appraise my close quarter battles.

4074
02:46:00,880 --> 02:46:01,140
Guys.

4075
02:46:02,600 --> 02:46:04,440
I need you guys.

4076
02:46:04,560 --> 02:46:08,740
I need you guys to appraise that specific message too.

4077
02:46:16,660 --> 02:46:17,100
Alright.

4078
02:46:17,280 --> 02:46:17,400
Oh!

4079
02:46:17,640 --> 02:46:18,420
Oh, round one.

4080
02:46:20,360 --> 02:46:21,340
What the fuck?

4081
02:46:21,460 --> 02:46:22,920
How do I get the other one?

4082
02:46:28,150 --> 02:46:28,690
Alright.

4083
02:46:28,750 --> 02:46:29,170
Here we go.

4084
02:46:31,850 --> 02:46:33,850
The summoning pool is now functional.

4085
02:46:34,090 --> 02:46:34,330
Okay.

4086
02:46:41,890 --> 02:46:42,430
Weeee!

4087
02:46:46,670 --> 02:46:48,930
You wear a paris seek target lock?

4088
02:46:49,410 --> 02:46:49,890
Oh.

4089
02:46:50,650 --> 02:46:51,350
The bat.

4090
02:46:52,950 --> 02:46:53,670
That's it.

4091
02:46:54,430 --> 02:46:56,350
The rare bow moment.

4092
02:46:59,470 --> 02:46:59,790
Okay.

4093
02:47:00,990 --> 02:47:01,690
Here we go.

4094
02:47:04,250 --> 02:47:04,910
That's okay, right?

4095
02:47:06,930 --> 02:47:07,990
That's okay, right?

4096
02:47:08,550 --> 02:47:08,950
Alright.

4097
02:47:09,410 --> 02:47:10,050
Never mind.

4098
02:47:10,290 --> 02:47:11,390
I thought he would, you know.

4099
02:47:14,330 --> 02:47:16,290
Apparently he's struggling right now.

4100
02:47:17,650 --> 02:47:18,930
Get out of here.

4101
02:47:20,750 --> 02:47:21,390
Leave!

4102
02:47:24,730 --> 02:47:25,550
Oh shit.

4103
02:47:25,610 --> 02:47:26,110
More bats.

4104
02:47:28,870 --> 02:47:29,830
That's right.

4105
02:47:30,130 --> 02:47:31,230
Kill your kids!

4106
02:47:31,570 --> 02:47:31,750
Yeah!

4107
02:47:32,010 --> 02:47:32,390
That's right!

4108
02:47:32,570 --> 02:47:33,390
Kill your children!

4109
02:47:34,010 --> 02:47:35,550
Now what you gonna do?

4110
02:47:35,650 --> 02:47:38,330
You spent all those years raising those kids.

4111
02:47:38,850 --> 02:47:40,670
Just for them to die.

4112
02:47:41,650 --> 02:47:42,950
That's fucking right.

4113
02:47:44,530 --> 02:47:45,610
Hehehe.

4114
02:47:46,210 --> 02:47:46,710
Hehehe.

4115
02:47:47,770 --> 02:47:49,690
Not a bad person.

4116
02:47:51,590 --> 02:47:53,030
We just have a...

4117
02:47:53,530 --> 02:47:55,030
Bat issue.

4118
02:47:58,350 --> 02:48:01,230
Look, they're invasive species, okay?

4119
02:48:03,250 --> 02:48:05,290
Killing them was like...

4120
02:48:05,290 --> 02:48:07,290
Basically helping the environment.

4121
02:48:08,710 --> 02:48:11,090
I'm just helping the environment right now.

4122
02:48:14,450 --> 02:48:16,270
The bloodline must end.

4123
02:48:16,410 --> 02:48:16,830
Exactly.

4124
02:48:18,610 --> 02:48:19,410
Ladder ahead?

4125
02:48:20,050 --> 02:48:20,850
Oh, can I...

4126
02:48:22,590 --> 02:48:23,410
Do I have to go down?

4127
02:48:23,570 --> 02:48:24,270
Do I have to?

4128
02:48:24,950 --> 02:48:25,870
But there's an up!

4129
02:48:26,650 --> 02:48:27,790
Wait, is there an up?

4130
02:48:28,850 --> 02:48:29,410
Yeah.

4131
02:48:30,910 --> 02:48:31,570
What's up?

4132
02:48:38,680 --> 02:48:40,360
Why down when there's an up?

4133
02:48:42,320 --> 02:48:43,600
Oh, down is loot?

4134
02:48:43,760 --> 02:48:43,980
Okay.

4135
02:48:45,340 --> 02:48:46,700
Okay, yes down then.

4136
02:48:51,760 --> 02:48:53,160
Oh, up is progress.

4137
02:48:53,400 --> 02:48:54,100
Down is loot.

4138
02:48:54,100 --> 02:48:55,120
Oh, I see.

4139
02:48:56,980 --> 02:48:58,220
Precious item ahead?

4140
02:48:58,540 --> 02:48:59,100
Oh, this thing.

4141
02:49:02,980 --> 02:49:03,620
Hey.

4142
02:49:03,980 --> 02:49:04,320
Oh.

4143
02:49:04,660 --> 02:49:06,040
I thought he was gonna be mad.

4144
02:49:09,820 --> 02:49:10,460
What?

4145
02:49:11,160 --> 02:49:11,620
Where?

4146
02:49:11,880 --> 02:49:12,840
Oh, there it is.

4147
02:49:13,060 --> 02:49:13,420
Oh!

4148
02:49:13,740 --> 02:49:14,700
It's a smithing stone!

4149
02:49:17,320 --> 02:49:18,700
He's just chillin'.

4150
02:49:19,560 --> 02:49:20,060
I don't know.

4151
02:49:20,460 --> 02:49:21,120
Hey there, buddy.

4152
02:49:22,100 --> 02:49:22,880
Working high?

4153
02:49:24,240 --> 02:49:24,880
Oh!

4154
02:49:25,220 --> 02:49:26,720
That's a good smithing stone!

4155
02:49:27,820 --> 02:49:28,300
Yoink!

4156
02:49:33,740 --> 02:49:34,220
Oh!

4157
02:49:34,460 --> 02:49:35,160
Oh shit!

4158
02:49:35,520 --> 02:49:36,160
I'm so...

4159
02:49:40,760 --> 02:49:41,520
That's okay.

4160
02:49:41,780 --> 02:49:42,860
I know he can't climb ladders.

4161
02:49:46,340 --> 02:49:47,140
That's okay.

4162
02:49:47,340 --> 02:49:48,960
I know he can't climb ladders.

4163
02:49:49,540 --> 02:49:50,080
We're fine.

4164
02:49:51,880 --> 02:49:52,880
I'll get over it.

4165
02:49:53,100 --> 02:49:54,200
It's not like I...

4166
02:49:54,900 --> 02:49:57,520
He was gonna use that to feed his family or anything.

4167
02:49:59,820 --> 02:50:01,320
You were in a pack?

4168
02:50:02,200 --> 02:50:03,060
We're in a head?

4169
02:50:04,860 --> 02:50:05,540
Where?

4170
02:50:05,820 --> 02:50:06,740
Oh, this one?

4171
02:50:11,830 --> 02:50:13,130
Ha ha ha!

4172
02:50:13,850 --> 02:50:15,470
Get out of here!

4173
02:50:16,750 --> 02:50:17,770
That's right!

4174
02:50:20,570 --> 02:50:21,510
Oh, nice.

4175
02:50:21,650 --> 02:50:22,510
Marshmissing stone.

4176
02:50:26,620 --> 02:50:27,070
What?

4177
02:50:27,180 --> 02:50:29,400
In a short range battle ahead?

4178
02:50:29,780 --> 02:50:30,660
Oh, these guys?

4179
02:50:34,410 --> 02:50:35,310
Oh.

4180
02:50:35,610 --> 02:50:36,110
That's fine.

4181
02:50:42,120 --> 02:50:42,800
Wait, what?

4182
02:50:45,300 --> 02:50:46,200
Pew!

4183
02:50:49,060 --> 02:50:49,960
Pew!

4184
02:50:50,980 --> 02:50:51,960
That's right.

4185
02:50:58,880 --> 02:50:59,800
I'm gonna punch you.

4186
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:00,960
I'll punch you.

4187
02:51:01,120 --> 02:51:01,840
That's right.

4188
02:51:02,300 --> 02:51:02,740
Oh shit!

4189
02:51:04,060 --> 02:51:04,880
Okay, maybe I should...

4190
02:51:04,880 --> 02:51:05,140
Oh!

4191
02:51:05,280 --> 02:51:06,340
Maybe I should have punched!

4192
02:51:07,140 --> 02:51:07,760
There you go.

4193
02:51:10,060 --> 02:51:12,400
Okay, I might have been a little too cocky there.

4194
02:51:12,400 --> 02:51:13,760
I got...

4195
02:51:13,760 --> 02:51:14,640
I got...

4196
02:51:14,640 --> 02:51:15,280
Straight...

4197
02:51:15,280 --> 02:51:16,080
And...

4198
02:51:17,260 --> 02:51:18,100
Okay.

4199
02:51:18,540 --> 02:51:18,780
Okay.

4200
02:51:19,400 --> 02:51:20,140
I got a...

4201
02:51:20,140 --> 02:51:20,820
Too wild.

4202
02:51:22,060 --> 02:51:22,480
Okay.

4203
02:51:23,200 --> 02:51:24,500
This be good fortune?

4204
02:51:28,590 --> 02:51:30,250
Punch the bat, Batman!

4205
02:51:31,490 --> 02:51:33,510
Just like Batman, I don't kill.

4206
02:51:33,510 --> 02:51:35,510
I just get blunt trauma.

4207
02:51:37,370 --> 02:51:38,410
To this...

4208
02:51:38,410 --> 02:51:39,330
Oh shit!

4209
02:51:39,510 --> 02:51:40,110
Wait, you're...

4210
02:51:40,110 --> 02:51:40,690
Oh!

4211
02:51:40,930 --> 02:51:41,550
Wait, what?

4212
02:51:45,630 --> 02:51:46,610
Oh shit!

4213
02:51:46,850 --> 02:51:47,410
No, I...

4214
02:51:47,410 --> 02:51:47,850
Poison.

4215
02:51:50,670 --> 02:51:53,830
Oh, so that's what they meant when they said use range.

4216
02:51:54,130 --> 02:51:55,530
But you sing so good!

4217
02:51:59,590 --> 02:52:00,830
Okay, I get it now.

4218
02:52:01,010 --> 02:52:01,770
I get it now.

4219
02:52:01,910 --> 02:52:02,490
I understand.

4220
02:52:02,990 --> 02:52:04,650
I didn't realize he was...

4221
02:52:04,650 --> 02:52:06,490
He was evil.

4222
02:52:06,830 --> 02:52:08,190
I thought he was friendly.

4223
02:52:09,670 --> 02:52:12,170
He seemed very friendly shaped.

4224
02:52:13,370 --> 02:52:15,130
Alright, now I'm poisoned again.

4225
02:52:16,770 --> 02:52:18,110
God dammit.

4226
02:52:20,070 --> 02:52:21,050
I don't know.

4227
02:52:21,170 --> 02:52:21,730
They were singing!

4228
02:52:21,930 --> 02:52:22,530
It was beautiful!

4229
02:52:23,510 --> 02:52:25,970
I was like enjoying the song!

4230
02:52:26,370 --> 02:52:27,270
It was so beautiful!

4231
02:52:35,380 --> 02:52:36,140
Oops.

4232
02:52:39,690 --> 02:52:41,070
Alright, off I go.

4233
02:52:44,480 --> 02:52:46,500
That was a beautiful song!

4234
02:52:46,860 --> 02:52:48,320
I was enjoying it.

4235
02:52:49,560 --> 02:52:51,420
Item head and jumping required?

4236
02:52:52,820 --> 02:52:53,820
Oh, this guy?

4237
02:52:57,320 --> 02:52:58,400
Does he give you item?

4238
02:52:59,040 --> 02:52:59,500
Oh, he...

4239
02:52:59,500 --> 02:52:59,820
OH!

4240
02:53:03,580 --> 02:53:04,140
Okay.

4241
02:53:05,380 --> 02:53:05,860
Bye.

4242
02:53:07,820 --> 02:53:09,100
The fuck is the item?

4243
02:53:09,340 --> 02:53:09,520
Enemy?

4244
02:53:09,640 --> 02:53:10,200
Oh, thank you.

4245
02:53:10,200 --> 02:53:10,760
I...

4246
02:53:10,760 --> 02:53:12,240
I wouldn't have known.

4247
02:53:17,270 --> 02:53:18,230
Oh my god!

4248
02:53:18,350 --> 02:53:18,770
I thought...

4249
02:53:18,770 --> 02:53:20,150
I thought that jump would dodge it.

4250
02:53:21,890 --> 02:53:23,030
The fuck is the item?

4251
02:53:23,170 --> 02:53:23,770
Oh, there it is.

4252
02:53:24,030 --> 02:53:24,870
I mean, there's the bat.

4253
02:53:29,660 --> 02:53:30,680
Where's this item?

4254
02:53:30,820 --> 02:53:31,840
Visions of item?

4255
02:53:32,280 --> 02:53:33,360
Oh, this one?

4256
02:53:34,560 --> 02:53:35,140
You know what?

4257
02:53:35,240 --> 02:53:35,600
Jump...

4258
02:53:35,600 --> 02:53:37,360
Okay, I don't think that's the jump.

4259
02:53:47,010 --> 02:53:48,310
It's so beautiful!

4260
02:53:48,310 --> 02:53:48,630
What the fuck?

4261
02:53:53,320 --> 02:53:54,400
Where is it?

4262
02:53:56,580 --> 02:53:57,880
First off, ladder.

4263
02:53:58,560 --> 02:53:58,660
Oh!

4264
02:53:58,900 --> 02:53:59,420
This one?

4265
02:54:06,920 --> 02:54:09,940
Okay, there's one, two, three, or four.

4266
02:54:14,270 --> 02:54:16,490
Oh, a lot of people died here, though.

4267
02:54:16,830 --> 02:54:18,210
I don't know about that.

4268
02:54:22,390 --> 02:54:22,870
Hmm...

4269
02:54:22,870 --> 02:54:23,710
Was it worth it?

4270
02:54:29,170 --> 02:54:30,470
Yeah, I'll do ladder first.

4271
02:54:30,470 --> 02:54:31,690
It doesn't seem worth it.

4272
02:54:34,470 --> 02:54:35,850
Alright, I'm going up first.

4273
02:54:36,710 --> 02:54:38,450
It definitely doesn't seem worth it.

4274
02:54:38,610 --> 02:54:42,230
I saw so many bloodstains, and I was like, I'm not adding myself to that.

4275
02:54:44,630 --> 02:54:45,550
Armments ahead?

4276
02:54:48,470 --> 02:54:48,990
Alright.

4277
02:54:53,610 --> 02:54:54,930
Oh, that's a big guy.

4278
02:54:59,620 --> 02:55:00,840
Why is it always...

4279
02:55:00,840 --> 02:55:01,860
This is a good item!

4280
02:55:02,020 --> 02:55:02,560
Why are you complaining?!

4281
02:55:05,900 --> 02:55:06,420
Alright.

4282
02:55:08,040 --> 02:55:08,820
Armments ahead.

4283
02:55:08,980 --> 02:55:09,940
Oh, I assume it's that guy.

4284
02:55:12,940 --> 02:55:13,460
What?!

4285
02:55:14,660 --> 02:55:17,540
He, like, fucking slam dunked me down.

4286
02:55:23,900 --> 02:55:24,220
Hmm...

4287
02:55:25,400 --> 02:55:25,720
Huh...

4288
02:55:25,720 --> 02:55:27,100
That's a big tumor.

4289
02:55:33,220 --> 02:55:34,080
Okay, I killed this kid.

4290
02:55:34,180 --> 02:55:34,820
I don't know if he likes it.

4291
02:55:34,980 --> 02:55:36,080
Okay, he definitely didn't like it.

4292
02:55:36,200 --> 02:55:37,000
Alright, jellyfish tap.

4293
02:55:37,120 --> 02:55:38,120
Oh, I can't do jellyfish.

4294
02:55:38,300 --> 02:55:39,280
Oh, okay, guys.

4295
02:55:39,400 --> 02:55:40,100
I can't do jellyfish.

4296
02:55:40,320 --> 02:55:40,780
That's okay.

4297
02:55:40,960 --> 02:55:41,840
Oh, my God!

4298
02:55:42,160 --> 02:55:43,100
Oh, my God!

4299
02:55:43,320 --> 02:55:43,420
Oh!

4300
02:55:47,970 --> 02:55:49,470
Guys, I think he's angry.

4301
02:55:49,470 --> 02:55:51,190
Oh, my God!

4302
02:55:51,430 --> 02:55:52,470
I do nothing?!

4303
02:55:55,810 --> 02:55:57,390
Oh, I have to hit that.

4304
02:55:58,070 --> 02:56:01,470
What the fuck did I fucking beat up?!

4305
02:56:04,920 --> 02:56:06,680
Like, where is your fucking...

4306
02:56:07,260 --> 02:56:08,700
Where is it?!

4307
02:56:08,700 --> 02:56:09,560
Oh, there it is.

4308
02:56:09,880 --> 02:56:12,560
Okay, I was like, where the fuck is your mouth?!

4309
02:56:12,560 --> 02:56:13,900
I couldn't tell!

4310
02:56:15,300 --> 02:56:16,280
There it is.

4311
02:56:18,820 --> 02:56:19,400
There it is.

4312
02:56:19,400 --> 02:56:19,880
I got it!

4313
02:56:22,640 --> 02:56:24,580
Okay, octopus thing.

4314
02:56:27,120 --> 02:56:28,500
Okay, smithing stone.

4315
02:56:28,700 --> 02:56:28,840
Yeah!

4316
02:56:30,100 --> 02:56:30,600
Ooh!

4317
02:56:31,140 --> 02:56:31,960
That looks nice.

4318
02:56:34,180 --> 02:56:35,860
Alright, now he's asleep forever.

4319
02:56:39,740 --> 02:56:41,040
Alright, we go this way.

4320
02:56:45,520 --> 02:56:47,420
I almost walked off the bridge.

4321
02:56:47,540 --> 02:56:48,660
I thought I was so safe.

4322
02:56:48,660 --> 02:56:49,400
I...

4323
02:56:49,400 --> 02:56:55,740
I was like, this feels safe.

4324
02:56:58,760 --> 02:57:01,900
Alright, now I can summon the octopus.

4325
02:57:16,980 --> 02:57:17,400
Ah!

4326
02:57:17,660 --> 02:57:19,860
No more singing for you!

4327
02:57:20,680 --> 02:57:21,820
That's right!

4328
02:57:22,900 --> 02:57:23,840
Ha ha ha!

4329
02:57:26,440 --> 02:57:29,120
Alright, now we got...

4330
02:57:31,620 --> 02:57:32,960
I deal with her.

4331
02:57:33,780 --> 02:57:35,640
As long as she doesn't throw poison at...

4332
02:57:35,640 --> 02:57:36,500
Oh my god!

4333
02:57:38,100 --> 02:57:39,060
Oh shit!

4334
02:57:39,460 --> 02:57:40,080
That's fine.

4335
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:41,500
Oh, he's old.

4336
02:57:42,720 --> 02:57:43,160
Nice.

4337
02:57:43,840 --> 02:57:45,220
Oh, it's a golden rune.

4338
02:57:45,340 --> 02:57:45,800
We need that.

4339
02:57:51,200 --> 02:57:51,760
Easy.

4340
02:57:53,600 --> 02:57:55,700
Oh shit, there's more of the grannies.

4341
02:57:56,780 --> 02:57:59,280
Oh shit, magic grannies!

4342
02:57:59,900 --> 02:58:02,260
Okay, now I definitely know that's cheating.

4343
02:58:04,580 --> 02:58:05,480
That's fine.

4344
02:58:06,460 --> 02:58:06,800
That's fine.

4345
02:58:07,360 --> 02:58:08,960
My jellyfish has got this.

4346
02:58:09,480 --> 02:58:11,200
Oh shit!

4347
02:58:11,800 --> 02:58:12,240
Oh shit!

4348
02:58:20,540 --> 02:58:22,220
That was so much HP!

4349
02:58:23,210 --> 02:58:26,690
That actually one shot of me!

4350
02:58:30,990 --> 02:58:33,670
I've never seen that move before!

4351
02:58:36,970 --> 02:58:38,650
Oh my god!

4352
02:58:40,390 --> 02:58:41,730
Oh my god!

4353
02:58:41,730 --> 02:58:41,770
Oh my god!

4354
02:58:41,850 --> 02:58:43,330
She fucking gripped me!

4355
02:58:44,210 --> 02:58:46,170
I was expecting that!

4356
02:58:50,450 --> 02:58:51,830
I'll kill her first.

4357
02:58:51,830 --> 02:58:53,690
And then I'll deal with this guy.

4358
02:58:58,390 --> 02:58:59,310
Okay.

4359
02:59:00,030 --> 02:59:01,970
Alright, I was not expecting...

4360
02:59:01,970 --> 02:59:02,490
The...

4361
02:59:02,490 --> 02:59:04,110
The granny to grip me.

4362
02:59:06,350 --> 02:59:07,910
And then children.

4363
02:59:08,630 --> 02:59:10,730
And then...

4364
02:59:13,330 --> 02:59:14,390
And then...

4365
02:59:14,390 --> 02:59:15,650
Mommy and daddy.

4366
02:59:15,850 --> 02:59:16,430
Next.

4367
02:59:17,370 --> 02:59:18,110
There you go.

4368
02:59:19,510 --> 02:59:20,350
Oh my god!

4369
02:59:22,170 --> 02:59:23,610
Those were some grippers.

4370
02:59:28,340 --> 02:59:28,720
Alright.

4371
02:59:29,280 --> 02:59:31,320
There were so many runes too!

4372
02:59:39,020 --> 02:59:39,780
Okay.

4373
02:59:40,780 --> 02:59:43,860
Aw, the worst part is that she guards the other ladder.

4374
02:59:48,750 --> 02:59:50,170
That's the worst part.

4375
02:59:50,170 --> 02:59:50,190
Alright.

4376
02:59:53,550 --> 02:59:55,670
Yeah, I gotta kill them one by one.

4377
02:59:57,250 --> 02:59:58,830
How the fuck did I get that?

4378
03:00:01,510 --> 03:00:02,470
God dammit!

4379
03:00:02,570 --> 03:00:02,730
Okay.

4380
03:00:02,950 --> 03:00:04,250
Let's see if I can craft more arrows.

4381
03:00:05,430 --> 03:00:06,270
Okay, I can.

4382
03:00:06,530 --> 03:00:06,770
Good.

4383
03:00:19,520 --> 03:00:20,000
Alright.

4384
03:00:20,560 --> 03:00:21,400
One down.

4385
03:00:24,060 --> 03:00:24,420
Ah!

4386
03:00:24,420 --> 03:00:24,580
Ow!

4387
03:00:27,360 --> 03:00:28,620
It was sick.

4388
03:00:28,800 --> 03:00:30,440
Bro, they just came out of nowhere!

4389
03:00:30,440 --> 03:00:31,560
I was trying to aim!

4390
03:00:32,420 --> 03:00:32,840
Alright.

4391
03:00:34,980 --> 03:00:35,460
Okay.

4392
03:00:36,020 --> 03:00:36,420
Okay.

4393
03:00:36,580 --> 03:00:36,820
That...

4394
03:00:36,820 --> 03:00:37,360
That...

4395
03:00:37,360 --> 03:00:37,680
Like...

4396
03:00:37,680 --> 03:00:38,820
I was not expecting that.

4397
03:00:45,590 --> 03:00:47,290
Okay, I'll grab these two first.

4398
03:00:53,600 --> 03:00:54,640
Alright, and then...

4399
03:00:55,820 --> 03:00:56,740
Wait, she stopped singing.

4400
03:00:57,040 --> 03:00:57,720
Wait, that's not good.

4401
03:00:57,980 --> 03:00:58,960
Wait, that's not good.

4402
03:00:59,180 --> 03:00:59,920
That's not good.

4403
03:01:00,060 --> 03:01:00,740
She stopped singing.

4404
03:01:03,180 --> 03:01:04,160
Oh my god.

4405
03:01:04,300 --> 03:01:05,700
Stupid fucking poison granny.

4406
03:01:06,220 --> 03:01:06,980
God dammit!

4407
03:01:07,040 --> 03:01:07,500
I hate you!

4408
03:01:08,580 --> 03:01:10,780
No wonder your kids don't visit you anymore.

4409
03:01:16,970 --> 03:01:19,610
There's a reason why your kids don't love you!

4410
03:01:22,370 --> 03:01:23,910
God, I hate poison granny.

4411
03:01:24,070 --> 03:01:24,550
I hate her.

4412
03:01:24,910 --> 03:01:25,690
I hate her.

4413
03:01:28,750 --> 03:01:31,830
She's not even one of the cool grannies either.

4414
03:01:31,830 --> 03:01:31,970
There.

4415
03:01:36,040 --> 03:01:36,800
That's right.

4416
03:01:37,760 --> 03:01:40,140
This is why none of your kids wanna see you!

4417
03:01:40,420 --> 03:01:40,720
Oh!

4418
03:01:48,090 --> 03:01:48,670
Jesus.

4419
03:01:51,170 --> 03:01:51,970
Oh my god.

4420
03:01:52,010 --> 03:01:52,530
Don't get gripped.

4421
03:01:52,950 --> 03:01:53,770
Don't get gripped.

4422
03:01:54,370 --> 03:01:54,830
Nice.

4423
03:01:58,440 --> 03:01:59,020
Alright.

4424
03:01:59,460 --> 03:02:00,760
Up the ladder I go.

4425
03:02:01,660 --> 03:02:02,500
Up, up, up.

4426
03:02:07,900 --> 03:02:09,700
I hope I can get my runes.

4427
03:02:12,360 --> 03:02:14,260
I hope I can get my runes in time.

4428
03:02:20,740 --> 03:02:21,260
Alright.

4429
03:02:22,200 --> 03:02:23,140
One down.

4430
03:02:23,900 --> 03:02:24,000
Whoa!

4431
03:02:25,440 --> 03:02:26,400
Two down.

4432
03:02:27,840 --> 03:02:28,820
Numeral three!

4433
03:02:29,200 --> 03:02:30,200
That's right, I got you!

4434
03:02:31,560 --> 03:02:32,080
Boom!

4435
03:02:32,240 --> 03:02:32,500
Okay.

4436
03:02:33,080 --> 03:02:35,140
Alright, it was embarrassing for both of us.

4437
03:02:45,760 --> 03:02:46,340
Alright.

4438
03:02:48,180 --> 03:02:48,760
Easy.

4439
03:02:52,400 --> 03:02:53,440
Up I go.

4440
03:02:57,120 --> 03:02:59,900
Yes, that's why it's embarrassing for both of us.

4441
03:03:00,020 --> 03:03:01,020
We both fucked up.

4442
03:03:06,140 --> 03:03:08,220
Alright, I believe in you jellyfish.

4443
03:03:08,220 --> 03:03:10,500
But let me grab this first in case I don't.

4444
03:03:14,950 --> 03:03:15,450
Alright.

4445
03:03:21,020 --> 03:03:21,520
Yeah.

4446
03:03:21,940 --> 03:03:22,740
Let me...

4447
03:03:22,740 --> 03:03:26,240
If I kill these guys, they won't notice, right?

4448
03:03:28,860 --> 03:03:30,160
Let's stay here first.

4449
03:03:35,930 --> 03:03:37,030
Okay, they don't notice.

4450
03:03:37,170 --> 03:03:37,490
That's good.

4451
03:03:40,170 --> 03:03:42,030
I just wanna make sure they don't...

4452
03:03:42,030 --> 03:03:43,130
They don't notice.

4453
03:03:45,510 --> 03:03:46,810
Guys, I think they notice.

4454
03:03:47,130 --> 03:03:48,270
Guys, I think they notice.

4455
03:03:48,450 --> 03:03:49,250
Guys, I think they notice.

4456
03:03:49,250 --> 03:03:50,430
Guys, I definitely think they notice, guys.

4457
03:03:50,950 --> 03:03:51,370
I...

4458
03:03:51,370 --> 03:03:51,830
I...

4459
03:03:54,710 --> 03:03:55,750
I think...

4460
03:03:55,750 --> 03:03:57,210
No, I can do this!

4461
03:03:58,030 --> 03:03:59,470
I can kill them!

4462
03:03:59,610 --> 03:04:00,150
I believe!

4463
03:04:00,650 --> 03:04:02,550
Okay, jellyfish, why are you running away?

4464
03:04:09,100 --> 03:04:09,960
Okay, that's fine.

4465
03:04:12,040 --> 03:04:14,840
Oh my god, it's that poison granny again.

4466
03:04:14,840 --> 03:04:16,060
It's her!

4467
03:04:18,320 --> 03:04:19,840
Oh my god, and magic?!

4468
03:04:22,120 --> 03:04:23,440
Oh god, oh no.

4469
03:04:23,560 --> 03:04:24,840
I didn't realize she had magic too.

4470
03:04:25,160 --> 03:04:26,780
I didn't realize she had everything.

4471
03:04:31,240 --> 03:04:32,680
Oh nice, nice interruption.

4472
03:04:34,980 --> 03:04:36,900
Oh my god, what if she just falls down?

4473
03:04:40,740 --> 03:04:41,720
That's right.

4474
03:04:42,300 --> 03:04:43,400
What you gonna do?

4475
03:04:43,580 --> 03:04:44,620
Fly back up?

4476
03:04:45,720 --> 03:04:47,240
Guys, she's flying back up.

4477
03:04:47,420 --> 03:04:48,740
I didn't expect that.

4478
03:04:51,640 --> 03:04:53,760
Guys, I can't believe it.

4479
03:04:54,140 --> 03:04:55,640
She flew back up.

4480
03:04:57,980 --> 03:04:59,020
There we go.

4481
03:05:00,540 --> 03:05:01,560
Oh, we did it.

4482
03:05:02,280 --> 03:05:02,940
Nice.

4483
03:05:05,840 --> 03:05:06,300
Nice.

4484
03:05:06,300 --> 03:05:06,560
Alright, nice.

4485
03:05:06,600 --> 03:05:07,420
More smithy stone.

4486
03:05:07,640 --> 03:05:08,120
We need that.

4487
03:05:09,200 --> 03:05:09,880
How did she...

4488
03:05:09,880 --> 03:05:11,300
Did she die to her own poison?

4489
03:05:15,620 --> 03:05:16,740
Precious item ahead.

4490
03:05:17,300 --> 03:05:18,440
Oh, I guess like in front of me.

4491
03:05:22,260 --> 03:05:24,220
Oh, my jelly poisoned her.

4492
03:05:24,760 --> 03:05:26,080
Forgot that he does that.

4493
03:05:29,320 --> 03:05:30,180
Praise here.

4494
03:05:30,520 --> 03:05:30,880
Nice.

4495
03:05:31,840 --> 03:05:33,800
Oh, Jimmy forgot my jellyfish can do that.

4496
03:05:35,280 --> 03:05:35,880
I...

4497
03:05:35,880 --> 03:05:38,080
I just been using her for like...

4498
03:05:38,400 --> 03:05:39,780
To like face tank.

4499
03:05:40,040 --> 03:05:40,600
I've...

4500
03:05:40,600 --> 03:05:40,900
Honestly.

4501
03:05:41,260 --> 03:05:43,220
She was just my face tanker.

4502
03:05:43,500 --> 03:05:45,540
I didn't realize she was more than that.

4503
03:05:47,120 --> 03:05:48,600
We'll use that so I can level up.

4504
03:05:48,700 --> 03:05:48,840
Alright.

4505
03:05:49,380 --> 03:05:49,980
Dexterity?

4506
03:05:50,140 --> 03:05:50,580
Vigor?

4507
03:05:51,160 --> 03:05:51,760
Or...

4508
03:05:52,640 --> 03:05:53,740
Or arcane?

4509
03:05:54,080 --> 03:05:54,260
Chat.

4510
03:05:54,600 --> 03:05:55,360
Which one?

4511
03:06:01,220 --> 03:06:02,380
Which one, guys?

4512
03:06:04,360 --> 03:06:04,960
Vigor?

4513
03:06:12,140 --> 03:06:12,740
Vigor?

4514
03:06:12,740 --> 03:06:13,100
Okay.

4515
03:06:15,040 --> 03:06:15,520
Wait.

4516
03:06:15,680 --> 03:06:15,900
Or...

4517
03:06:15,900 --> 03:06:16,140
Wait.

4518
03:06:16,220 --> 03:06:16,960
Or dexterity.

4519
03:06:17,100 --> 03:06:18,380
When did I upgrade last time?

4520
03:06:18,540 --> 03:06:19,020
I don't remember.

4521
03:06:22,520 --> 03:06:23,000
Alright.

4522
03:06:23,080 --> 03:06:23,680
I'll do Vigor.

4523
03:06:23,760 --> 03:06:24,960
And then I'll do dexterity next.

4524
03:06:26,020 --> 03:06:26,640
Oh, I should...

4525
03:06:26,640 --> 03:06:26,880
Yeah.

4526
03:06:26,960 --> 03:06:27,300
I'll do...

4527
03:06:27,300 --> 03:06:27,800
Uh...

4528
03:06:27,800 --> 03:06:28,780
Dexterity next time.

4529
03:06:29,780 --> 03:06:30,600
Dragon ahead?

4530
03:06:30,980 --> 03:06:31,280
Oh.

4531
03:06:31,660 --> 03:06:32,320
I like that.

4532
03:06:32,480 --> 03:06:32,820
Wait.

4533
03:06:32,860 --> 03:06:34,840
I think I can upgrade my sword again.

4534
03:06:34,840 --> 03:06:35,720
I'm pretty sure.

4535
03:06:36,220 --> 03:06:37,820
I got so many stones.

4536
03:06:45,080 --> 03:06:46,200
I must have...

4537
03:06:46,200 --> 03:06:46,520
Oh, wait.

4538
03:06:46,820 --> 03:06:48,620
Gotta talk to Two Toes right here.

4539
03:06:49,440 --> 03:06:49,800
Hello.

4540
03:06:54,500 --> 03:06:56,420
You have returned.

4541
03:06:57,980 --> 03:06:59,580
What is it?

4542
03:07:02,020 --> 03:07:02,740
Uh...

4543
03:07:07,190 --> 03:07:08,390
Do we want...

4544
03:07:08,390 --> 03:07:09,130
Remembrance?

4545
03:07:09,130 --> 03:07:09,850
Or champions?

4546
03:07:14,390 --> 03:07:15,970
I don't know what this is for.

4547
03:07:22,850 --> 03:07:23,210
Remembrance?

4548
03:07:23,210 --> 03:07:24,010
Oh, I can do both?

4549
03:07:24,370 --> 03:07:24,530
Oh.

4550
03:07:27,010 --> 03:07:30,790
Reach up and provide one power once the remembrance will be lost.

4551
03:07:32,330 --> 03:07:33,330
What does it do?

4552
03:07:34,030 --> 03:07:34,570
Oh!

4553
03:07:34,950 --> 03:07:37,490
I get to have, like, her sword and stuff.

4554
03:07:38,210 --> 03:07:38,610
Oh!

4555
03:07:40,770 --> 03:07:41,910
Is it worth it?

4556
03:07:45,360 --> 03:07:46,460
How about this?

4557
03:07:47,660 --> 03:07:48,960
Are any of these worth it?

4558
03:07:50,500 --> 03:07:51,420
Oh my god.

4559
03:07:51,560 --> 03:07:52,460
7,000?

4560
03:07:53,640 --> 03:07:54,640
Boss weapons?

4561
03:07:54,940 --> 03:07:55,040
Boss weapons?

4562
03:07:55,040 --> 03:07:55,720
Is it worth it?

4563
03:08:01,160 --> 03:08:02,740
Not worth it for your build?

4564
03:08:02,920 --> 03:08:03,380
Oh, okay.

4565
03:08:04,700 --> 03:08:05,080
Okay.

4566
03:08:05,580 --> 03:08:05,900
Bye.

4567
03:08:09,000 --> 03:08:10,420
Oh, it's just for cosplay?

4568
03:08:13,720 --> 03:08:15,020
It's just cosplay.

4569
03:08:19,390 --> 03:08:19,910
Alright.

4570
03:08:19,910 --> 03:08:21,210
Let's upgrade my sword.

4571
03:08:22,510 --> 03:08:23,270
Let's upgrade my sword.

4572
03:08:25,550 --> 03:08:25,990
Uh...

4573
03:08:25,990 --> 03:08:26,410
Oh, I...

4574
03:08:26,410 --> 03:08:27,490
Oh, I don't have enough.

4575
03:08:27,730 --> 03:08:28,230
Wait, do I?

4576
03:08:28,670 --> 03:08:29,670
No, I need four.

4577
03:08:29,810 --> 03:08:30,230
I only have two.

4578
03:08:30,410 --> 03:08:31,110
God damn it!

4579
03:08:31,410 --> 03:08:32,610
I don't have enough anyway.

4580
03:08:32,970 --> 03:08:34,010
What about my jellyfish?

4581
03:08:36,230 --> 03:08:37,570
I don't have enough either.

4582
03:08:38,550 --> 03:08:38,870
Fuck!

4583
03:08:39,330 --> 03:08:39,730
Alright.

4584
03:08:40,730 --> 03:08:41,890
Yes, I leave.

4585
03:08:43,570 --> 03:08:44,750
Yes, I leave.

4586
03:08:45,030 --> 03:08:45,310
Yes, I leave then.

4587
03:08:45,830 --> 03:08:46,570
It's time to fight.

4588
03:08:47,370 --> 03:08:48,310
Oh, fuck, not here.

4589
03:08:48,570 --> 03:08:49,530
I got lost.

4590
03:08:55,580 --> 03:08:56,140
Uh...

4591
03:08:57,100 --> 03:08:57,380
Here.

4592
03:09:03,580 --> 03:09:05,320
Oh, I can use my boss's?

4593
03:09:05,620 --> 03:09:07,000
How do I sell that?

4594
03:09:09,640 --> 03:09:10,160
Oh, this?

4595
03:09:11,980 --> 03:09:13,060
How much does it give?

4596
03:09:14,460 --> 03:09:15,540
Should I use it?

4597
03:09:20,790 --> 03:09:22,170
Is it worth using them?

4598
03:09:32,240 --> 03:09:34,660
How come some people are saying it's not worth it?

4599
03:09:35,100 --> 03:09:36,720
Why are some people saying save them?

4600
03:09:38,940 --> 03:09:40,060
Save it for what?

4601
03:09:47,400 --> 03:09:48,120
Wait, what?

4602
03:09:48,300 --> 03:09:49,520
Why would I need to save them?

4603
03:09:53,510 --> 03:09:54,790
How do you dupe them?

4604
03:10:00,530 --> 03:10:01,570
Oh, in case you...

4605
03:10:01,570 --> 03:10:02,930
Haha, I'm not changing builds.

4606
03:10:03,050 --> 03:10:04,130
You think I'm gonna be a nerd?

4607
03:10:04,630 --> 03:10:05,310
Fuck no.

4608
03:10:08,490 --> 03:10:10,270
You think I'm gonna be a nerd?

4609
03:10:10,510 --> 03:10:12,370
You know which one I'm definitely gonna pop?

4610
03:10:12,690 --> 03:10:13,090
Hers!

4611
03:10:13,850 --> 03:10:14,210
Get out!

4612
03:10:14,350 --> 03:10:14,690
Oh, wait.

4613
03:10:14,830 --> 03:10:16,750
Use Remembrance of the Full Moon Queen?

4614
03:10:17,530 --> 03:10:18,210
Wait, what?

4615
03:10:19,450 --> 03:10:20,690
Do I just use it here?

4616
03:10:26,500 --> 03:10:27,100
That's right!

4617
03:10:27,280 --> 03:10:27,940
Watch this!

4618
03:10:31,880 --> 03:10:32,280
Boom!

4619
03:10:32,860 --> 03:10:34,860
No more nerds now!

4620
03:10:37,940 --> 03:10:39,540
That's right!

4621
03:10:40,820 --> 03:10:42,660
Alright, now I'll grab this.

4622
03:10:44,020 --> 03:10:45,120
That's right!

4623
03:10:45,660 --> 03:10:47,800
Get out of there, nerds!

4624
03:10:48,540 --> 03:10:50,140
Magic's for pussies!

4625
03:10:52,880 --> 03:10:54,500
Nerd obliterated!

4626
03:10:55,040 --> 03:10:56,660
As it should!

4627
03:10:56,660 --> 03:10:56,680
Nerd!

4628
03:11:03,790 --> 03:11:05,350
Alright, that does.

4629
03:11:06,390 --> 03:11:08,410
Alright, Dexterity or Vigor chat?

4630
03:11:08,890 --> 03:11:10,190
Depths 45!

4631
03:11:10,790 --> 03:11:12,530
Yeah, but I didn't die to the nerd!

4632
03:11:12,950 --> 03:11:15,310
I'd die to the real gamers!

4633
03:11:15,890 --> 03:11:16,770
The bats!

4634
03:11:26,780 --> 03:11:27,660
Alright, Vigor.

4635
03:11:28,000 --> 03:11:28,160
Okay.

4636
03:11:34,130 --> 03:11:35,490
Alright, let's go forward.

4637
03:11:39,380 --> 03:11:42,880
Beware a raptor, dragon, a head, monster, a head.

4638
03:11:43,140 --> 03:11:43,860
Pfff!

4639
03:11:43,860 --> 03:11:44,380
Easy.

4640
03:11:44,580 --> 03:11:45,200
Watch this.

4641
03:11:47,420 --> 03:11:48,620
First off.

4642
03:11:55,030 --> 03:11:56,150
Let's see ya.

4643
03:11:59,550 --> 03:12:00,830
Help me!

4644
03:12:04,430 --> 03:12:06,890
Okay, wait, let me see what he did.

4645
03:12:11,230 --> 03:12:11,830
Revenge!

4646
03:12:15,990 --> 03:12:17,430
Alright, I'm ready.

4647
03:12:22,690 --> 03:12:23,790
Okay, where is he?

4648
03:12:23,930 --> 03:12:25,090
I know this is not a...

4649
03:12:25,090 --> 03:12:25,570
I...

4650
03:12:25,570 --> 03:12:30,450
I can't seem to find the story bosses, apparently, because there's no cutscene.

4651
03:12:30,830 --> 03:12:34,310
And they've killed like two non-story bosses so far.

4652
03:12:34,990 --> 03:12:36,210
Oh my god.

4653
03:12:36,750 --> 03:12:37,830
Oh my god.

4654
03:12:37,990 --> 03:12:40,090
He's slowly heading towards me, isn't he?

4655
03:12:44,330 --> 03:12:45,810
Wait, what do you mean good luck?

4656
03:12:46,850 --> 03:12:48,850
Guys, what the fuck do you mean?

4657
03:12:48,850 --> 03:12:50,390
How bad is it?

4658
03:12:50,750 --> 03:12:51,050
How...

4659
03:12:51,050 --> 03:12:51,770
Oh my god!

4660
03:12:52,010 --> 03:12:53,330
I don't know why I walked into it.

4661
03:12:53,550 --> 03:12:54,450
I don't know why.

4662
03:12:56,810 --> 03:12:58,470
I just wanted to be inside.

4663
03:12:59,690 --> 03:13:00,130
Oh!

4664
03:13:00,710 --> 03:13:01,150
What?

4665
03:13:06,600 --> 03:13:06,740
No!

4666
03:13:06,960 --> 03:13:08,860
Oh, I did accidentally have the wrong clasp.

4667
03:13:09,060 --> 03:13:09,600
Okay, thank god.

4668
03:13:10,060 --> 03:13:10,600
Thank god.

4669
03:13:10,800 --> 03:13:10,920
Okay.

4670
03:13:12,040 --> 03:13:14,240
Alright, I thought I fucked up, but I didn't.

4671
03:13:14,860 --> 03:13:15,500
That's good.

4672
03:13:15,760 --> 03:13:18,080
Jesus Christ, my jellyfish is not having a good time.

4673
03:13:20,540 --> 03:13:21,700
Are you serious?

4674
03:13:21,700 --> 03:13:22,980
Oh, it's the tail!

4675
03:13:26,080 --> 03:13:27,860
Oh, that's what the tail does!

4676
03:13:30,560 --> 03:13:31,700
Okay, I know now.

4677
03:13:32,040 --> 03:13:34,000
Who the fuck gave this lizard a sword?

4678
03:13:35,760 --> 03:13:38,380
It got this lizard to touch me and it hit me!

4679
03:13:46,320 --> 03:13:47,100
Okay, nice.

4680
03:13:48,080 --> 03:13:49,940
I'm just gonna recharge real quick.

4681
03:13:50,160 --> 03:13:50,520
Oh, okay.

4682
03:13:58,110 --> 03:13:58,990
Oh my god.

4683
03:13:59,190 --> 03:14:02,850
I thought he was gonna fucking, like, slam dunk me again.

4684
03:14:03,610 --> 03:14:03,930
Oh!

4685
03:14:04,170 --> 03:14:04,350
Oh!

4686
03:14:04,510 --> 03:14:04,790
Oh!

4687
03:14:04,950 --> 03:14:05,230
Oh!

4688
03:14:05,730 --> 03:14:06,250
Oh!

4689
03:14:10,470 --> 03:14:11,790
Oh my god!

4690
03:14:12,010 --> 03:14:13,250
He did slam dunk me!

4691
03:14:18,140 --> 03:14:19,360
Bro, he can walk?

4692
03:14:19,680 --> 03:14:20,600
Can he sing too?

4693
03:14:21,180 --> 03:14:22,300
I can- Oh!

4694
03:14:25,900 --> 03:14:27,220
Oh my god!

4695
03:14:28,320 --> 03:14:29,080
Oh my god!

4696
03:14:29,160 --> 03:14:29,560
Oh my god, my poor guy.

4697
03:14:33,080 --> 03:14:35,720
Oh my god, I'm fucking- I'm greedy.

4698
03:14:36,020 --> 03:14:37,580
I don't know why I'm always greedy.

4699
03:14:38,100 --> 03:14:38,260
Oh!

4700
03:14:42,970 --> 03:14:43,550
Please!

4701
03:14:44,430 --> 03:14:45,590
Holy shit!

4702
03:14:45,750 --> 03:14:49,170
You're so- Oh my god.

4703
03:14:49,290 --> 03:14:50,130
Oh my god.

4704
03:14:51,570 --> 03:14:52,150
Oh

4705
03:14:57,550 --> 03:14:58,050
my god.

4706
03:14:58,050 --> 03:15:00,330
Thank fucking god!

4707
03:15:02,050 --> 03:15:02,650
Thank fucking god!

4708
03:15:02,650 --> 03:15:03,350
Okay, we did it.

4709
03:15:03,550 --> 03:15:04,510
Okay, it wasn't that bad.

4710
03:15:04,830 --> 03:15:05,850
It was not that bad.

4711
03:15:06,130 --> 03:15:07,690
It was not that bad.

4712
03:15:08,450 --> 03:15:09,390
Thank god.

4713
03:15:10,630 --> 03:15:11,690
Close crystal.

4714
03:15:12,090 --> 03:15:13,650
No strong, bro!

4715
03:15:14,790 --> 03:15:15,630
Actually, hey.

4716
03:15:16,590 --> 03:15:17,190
Good.

4717
03:15:17,430 --> 03:15:18,390
That was a good message.

4718
03:15:23,830 --> 03:15:25,330
That's a good message.

4719
03:15:25,630 --> 03:15:26,370
You're right.

4720
03:15:26,370 --> 03:15:26,450
Alright.

4721
03:15:27,190 --> 03:15:28,710
That's so easy.

4722
03:15:36,540 --> 03:15:37,700
Alright, let's see.

4723
03:15:38,940 --> 03:15:40,540
It's time to level up.

4724
03:15:41,060 --> 03:15:42,560
I'll do Dexterity and Vigor.

4725
03:15:46,540 --> 03:15:48,580
Am I severely under level?

4726
03:15:48,780 --> 03:15:49,880
How did I get here?

4727
03:15:50,360 --> 03:15:50,820
How-

4728
03:15:54,900 --> 03:15:55,560
Well done.

4729
03:15:55,680 --> 03:15:56,080
Oh, wait.

4730
03:15:56,220 --> 03:15:57,480
It's the influencer build.

4731
03:15:57,680 --> 03:16:00,000
I think it's actually gonna fuck me over long-term.

4732
03:16:01,040 --> 03:16:03,400
Think carefully and then regret.

4733
03:16:05,040 --> 03:16:05,940
Try jumping?

4734
03:16:13,320 --> 03:16:14,240
Okay.

4735
03:16:24,100 --> 03:16:24,840
Dude.

4736
03:16:28,160 --> 03:16:29,380
Where is it?

4737
03:16:29,480 --> 03:16:29,820
Action.

4738
03:16:33,020 --> 03:16:34,240
Oh, where is it?

4739
03:16:37,500 --> 03:16:40,020
Where's the- Where's the try jumping?

4740
03:16:41,400 --> 03:16:42,520
Is the jump?

4741
03:16:43,720 --> 03:16:45,640
I also want to tell him to jump.

4742
03:16:47,700 --> 03:16:48,260
Down.

4743
03:16:48,720 --> 03:16:49,520
There we go.

4744
03:16:50,560 --> 03:16:51,280
Go down.

4745
03:16:52,660 --> 03:16:53,000
Alright.

4746
03:16:54,580 --> 03:16:55,140
From?

4747
03:16:57,040 --> 03:16:58,640
Alright, remember to upload that.

4748
03:16:58,920 --> 03:17:01,160
And upload the next- The other guy that says try jumping.

4749
03:17:02,660 --> 03:17:05,060
Guys, remember to upload those two messages.

4750
03:17:05,680 --> 03:17:07,140
Then we're gonna get them.

4751
03:17:13,110 --> 03:17:13,510
Um.

4752
03:17:14,490 --> 03:17:14,910
Hey, Dookie.

4753
03:17:15,010 --> 03:17:17,110
Not sure if anybody has said this yet.

4754
03:17:17,470 --> 03:17:19,090
But hold down the button for a sec.

4755
03:17:19,310 --> 03:17:20,570
It takes you to the first slot.

4756
03:17:20,710 --> 03:17:21,630
Which is your healing class.

4757
03:17:21,910 --> 03:17:23,070
Thank you to the super chat for it.

4758
03:17:23,130 --> 03:17:23,890
Thank you, thank you.

4759
03:17:24,010 --> 03:17:24,570
Yeah, that's helpful.

4760
03:17:26,390 --> 03:17:28,130
That's something I keep forgetting to do.

4761
03:17:30,070 --> 03:17:31,090
Get- Oh, fuck!

4762
03:17:36,360 --> 03:17:36,760
Alright.

4763
03:17:48,890 --> 03:17:50,910
Okay, I need to find this thing.

4764
03:17:52,690 --> 03:17:53,010
Item.

4765
03:17:54,330 --> 03:17:56,950
Okay, remember to upload our two messages, guys.

4766
03:17:59,330 --> 03:18:06,510
And then- And then make sure- And then make sure you- You say pour on this one.

4767
03:18:09,410 --> 03:18:09,970
Alright.

4768
03:18:10,470 --> 03:18:12,610
Make sure you put pour for this message.

4769
03:18:12,890 --> 03:18:15,490
And then appraise these two messages, guys.

4770
03:18:16,390 --> 03:18:17,490
Then we'll get them.

4771
03:18:17,630 --> 03:18:18,490
We'll get them all.

4772
03:18:24,470 --> 03:18:26,750
Tell them all what I did, Eagle.

4773
03:18:27,050 --> 03:18:27,990
Tell them all.

4774
03:18:31,870 --> 03:18:32,430
Alright.

4775
03:18:33,690 --> 03:18:35,770
I don't think I've done a story boss yet.

4776
03:18:35,770 --> 03:18:37,930
I don't even know where is a story boss.

4777
03:18:42,200 --> 03:18:44,120
Alright, it's time to Skyrim this rock.

4778
03:18:49,330 --> 03:18:50,310
Where am I?

4779
03:18:52,130 --> 03:18:53,730
Is there a way to get mad for this area?

4780
03:19:00,740 --> 03:19:01,440
This way?

4781
03:19:05,160 --> 03:19:06,700
I don't even know where I am.

4782
03:19:06,940 --> 03:19:07,900
I'm so lost.

4783
03:19:09,380 --> 03:19:12,260
This guy seems dangerous, so I'm gonna ignore him.

4784
03:19:18,490 --> 03:19:19,550
I guess I'll go this way?

4785
03:19:19,550 --> 03:19:19,610
Okay.

4786
03:19:24,340 --> 03:19:27,780
Yeah, I killed like three non-story bosses so far.

4787
03:19:27,900 --> 03:19:28,760
Oh, there is a Grace here.

4788
03:19:28,860 --> 03:19:29,120
Nice.

4789
03:19:31,740 --> 03:19:32,540
That's good.

4790
03:19:33,780 --> 03:19:34,600
Good to know.

4791
03:19:40,240 --> 03:19:40,760
Yay!

4792
03:19:41,580 --> 03:19:42,420
There's a map?

4793
03:19:42,820 --> 03:19:45,660
Oh, I don't see an area to get a map, though.

4794
03:19:47,180 --> 03:19:47,720
Are you sure?

4795
03:19:58,060 --> 03:19:59,360
What's killed it?

4796
03:20:01,100 --> 03:20:01,860
What's that?

4797
03:20:05,940 --> 03:20:07,520
Oh my god!

4798
03:20:07,720 --> 03:20:08,640
I knew he was good.

4799
03:20:09,120 --> 03:20:10,520
Oh my god!

4800
03:20:10,700 --> 03:20:11,560
I'm gonna steal your item!

4801
03:20:13,360 --> 03:20:13,820
No!

4802
03:20:14,540 --> 03:20:15,820
I'm sorry!

4803
03:20:20,680 --> 03:20:21,360
No!

4804
03:20:21,360 --> 03:20:23,700
I guess I'm not.

4805
03:20:23,960 --> 03:20:26,600
I guess I'm not gonna steal the item.

4806
03:20:27,060 --> 03:20:27,640
You see?

4807
03:20:28,100 --> 03:20:33,240
I guess, because you can have it.

4808
03:20:35,580 --> 03:20:36,940
I guess.

4809
03:20:37,360 --> 03:20:38,520
I don't need it.

4810
03:20:40,900 --> 03:20:42,640
Guys, I don't need it, I swear.

4811
03:20:48,360 --> 03:20:48,760
Hello.

4812
03:20:50,300 --> 03:20:50,700
Ooh!

4813
03:20:52,240 --> 03:20:53,000
Ha ha ha.

4814
03:20:53,460 --> 03:20:54,280
That's looking right.

4815
03:20:54,800 --> 03:20:55,400
Ha ha ha.

4816
03:20:56,400 --> 03:20:57,300
That's looking right.

4817
03:20:58,660 --> 03:20:59,460
Get circled.

4818
03:20:59,600 --> 03:20:59,920
Oh, what?

4819
03:20:59,980 --> 03:21:00,900
Oh my gosh, he ran back.

4820
03:21:02,440 --> 03:21:03,240
Get juked.

4821
03:21:03,780 --> 03:21:04,280
Ha ha ha.

4822
03:21:06,740 --> 03:21:07,540
Where's Candid?

4823
03:21:07,800 --> 03:21:08,540
The fuck is that?

4824
03:21:08,640 --> 03:21:08,940
Wait, what?

4825
03:21:09,040 --> 03:21:10,100
I get to talk to my girlfriend?

4826
03:21:12,780 --> 03:21:13,300
Hello.

4827
03:21:13,300 --> 03:21:14,480
Hello, my lady.

4828
03:21:18,240 --> 03:21:21,160
The earth tree is close.

4829
03:21:21,740 --> 03:21:24,100
Only a little further till the foot of the earth tree.

4830
03:21:24,100 --> 03:21:25,700
Ahead east from the starting area?

4831
03:21:25,920 --> 03:21:26,160
Alright.

4832
03:21:32,380 --> 03:21:33,840
Mox, thank you for the super chat.

4833
03:21:34,020 --> 03:21:34,920
Thank you, thank you.

4834
03:21:36,360 --> 03:21:38,480
I'm glad you're having spun it off, guy.

4835
03:21:38,480 --> 03:21:39,320
I'm sorry.

4836
03:21:39,500 --> 03:21:41,700
I still have a panel tomorrow, so you can see me there.

4837
03:21:41,920 --> 03:21:46,360
I have to ascertain for myself the reason for which I live.

4838
03:21:47,220 --> 03:21:47,740
Burned.

4839
03:21:48,540 --> 03:21:49,580
And bodiless.

4840
03:21:51,160 --> 03:21:51,560
Alright.

4841
03:21:52,460 --> 03:21:53,060
Is that it?

4842
03:21:53,640 --> 03:21:54,700
That's all I have to say?

4843
03:21:55,260 --> 03:21:55,780
Alright.

4844
03:21:56,100 --> 03:21:56,920
Bye, girlfriend.

4845
03:21:57,760 --> 03:21:58,900
I guess that was just lore.

4846
03:22:00,000 --> 03:22:00,720
Where?

4847
03:22:00,720 --> 03:22:02,060
To, like, here?

4848
03:22:05,060 --> 03:22:05,960
Or is it here?

4849
03:22:06,320 --> 03:22:07,140
Did I go here?

4850
03:22:07,940 --> 03:22:08,660
From...

4851
03:22:09,560 --> 03:22:10,700
The starting area?

4852
03:22:12,740 --> 03:22:13,600
Kaelin is fun.

4853
03:22:13,840 --> 03:22:15,120
Me when I lie.

4854
03:22:16,520 --> 03:22:17,120
Guys.

4855
03:22:17,500 --> 03:22:19,980
Is it not actually fun, guys?

4856
03:22:22,660 --> 03:22:26,020
I have a feeling it might not actually is fun.

4857
03:22:26,700 --> 03:22:27,400
Is it poison?

4858
03:22:27,720 --> 03:22:28,480
Oh, my God.

4859
03:22:28,640 --> 03:22:29,780
Is it poison, guys?

4860
03:22:34,900 --> 03:22:37,560
Are you taking me to poison swamps?

4861
03:22:43,920 --> 03:22:45,440
Is it even better?

4862
03:22:45,740 --> 03:22:46,740
Oh, my...

4863
03:22:46,740 --> 03:22:48,960
You think I don't know what Scarlet Rot is?

4864
03:22:48,960 --> 03:22:50,780
That's the whole Melania shit.

4865
03:22:51,720 --> 03:22:53,220
Oh, my God!

4866
03:22:57,200 --> 03:22:59,020
Where did he come from?

4867
03:23:04,240 --> 03:23:04,800
Okay.

4868
03:23:05,060 --> 03:23:05,580
That's it.

4869
03:23:06,400 --> 03:23:06,960
Jellyfish.

4870
03:23:08,580 --> 03:23:09,360
Oh, wait.

4871
03:23:09,420 --> 03:23:10,120
I know this boss.

4872
03:23:10,240 --> 03:23:10,940
That's a Night Ring.

4873
03:23:12,620 --> 03:23:14,080
This boss is a Night Ring.

4874
03:23:14,440 --> 03:23:15,500
I've seen him.

4875
03:23:17,580 --> 03:23:19,500
It was just flying, Doki.

4876
03:23:22,040 --> 03:23:23,120
Oh, my God.

4877
03:23:23,240 --> 03:23:23,300
Oh, my God.

4878
03:23:23,300 --> 03:23:23,960
That still hits me.

4879
03:23:24,220 --> 03:23:24,800
I thought...

4880
03:23:24,800 --> 03:23:25,220
I don't know.

4881
03:23:25,400 --> 03:23:26,900
I thought I was being so cool.

4882
03:23:27,100 --> 03:23:29,220
I thought I was gonna, you know...

4883
03:23:29,220 --> 03:23:31,140
Dodge the fucking fire.

4884
03:23:31,900 --> 03:23:33,000
Just, you know...

4885
03:23:33,000 --> 03:23:33,640
Oh, my God!

4886
03:23:33,800 --> 03:23:34,120
I...

4887
03:23:34,120 --> 03:23:34,620
No!

4888
03:23:35,040 --> 03:23:35,320
Fuck!

4889
03:23:38,080 --> 03:23:38,640
Alright.

4890
03:23:40,080 --> 03:23:40,840
That's fine.

4891
03:23:41,980 --> 03:23:42,420
I'm...

4892
03:23:42,420 --> 03:23:43,120
That's not fine.

4893
03:23:45,000 --> 03:23:45,560
I'm...

4894
03:23:45,560 --> 03:23:47,580
I'm trying so hard to get his legs.

4895
03:23:47,860 --> 03:23:49,000
I really am.

4896
03:23:49,000 --> 03:23:50,020
I swear to God.

4897
03:23:50,860 --> 03:23:52,540
I swear to God!

4898
03:23:53,380 --> 03:23:54,500
It's not...

4899
03:23:54,500 --> 03:23:55,060
Oh, my God!

4900
03:23:55,220 --> 03:23:57,520
It's not letting me lock into anything, apparently!

4901
03:24:00,380 --> 03:24:02,600
I can't lock in anything!

4902
03:24:07,010 --> 03:24:08,510
Okay, we can wait here.

4903
03:24:09,210 --> 03:24:10,410
Okay, apparently not.

4904
03:24:10,670 --> 03:24:11,890
What is your range?

4905
03:24:18,600 --> 03:24:19,860
Oh, don't lock in.

4906
03:24:19,980 --> 03:24:20,000
Oh, don't lock in.

4907
03:24:20,000 --> 03:24:20,360
It's better?

4908
03:24:20,660 --> 03:24:20,820
Okay.

4909
03:24:21,220 --> 03:24:21,840
I know now.

4910
03:24:22,200 --> 03:24:23,260
I got a rock.

4911
03:24:23,600 --> 03:24:24,360
To block it all.

4912
03:24:27,980 --> 03:24:28,480
Okay.

4913
03:24:30,800 --> 03:24:31,960
Okay, I got this.

4914
03:24:35,960 --> 03:24:36,460
Alright.

4915
03:24:38,200 --> 03:24:38,700
Alright.

4916
03:24:38,920 --> 03:24:39,800
Oh, my God!

4917
03:24:39,940 --> 03:24:40,680
Not the fire!

4918
03:24:43,840 --> 03:24:44,740
Oh, my God!

4919
03:24:44,880 --> 03:24:45,560
He's flying away!

4920
03:24:45,800 --> 03:24:46,320
You cheater!

4921
03:24:46,500 --> 03:24:47,360
Get back here!

4922
03:24:47,740 --> 03:24:48,620
Fight me!

4923
03:24:50,860 --> 03:24:52,760
You chose this fight!

4924
03:24:52,920 --> 03:24:54,980
I was literally minding my own business!

4925
03:24:55,890 --> 03:24:56,320
Oh!

4926
03:24:56,340 --> 03:24:57,200
Shit!

4927
03:24:59,980 --> 03:25:00,840
What?!

4928
03:25:04,910 --> 03:25:08,840
How can you be so big, but so hard to hit?!

4929
03:25:10,460 --> 03:25:12,660
I don't understand!

4930
03:25:13,500 --> 03:25:14,980
I don't understand!

4931
03:25:15,560 --> 03:25:16,640
Oh, my God!

4932
03:25:16,820 --> 03:25:18,960
You actually fight like a pussy!

4933
03:25:19,460 --> 03:25:20,200
You...

4934
03:25:20,440 --> 03:25:23,700
You actually fight like a fucking pussy!

4935
03:25:24,120 --> 03:25:24,920
I...

4936
03:25:24,920 --> 03:25:26,400
Oh, I hate this man.

4937
03:25:26,840 --> 03:25:28,520
I hate this dragon.

4938
03:25:32,680 --> 03:25:36,100
He's so big, yet so hard to hit!

4939
03:25:36,260 --> 03:25:37,380
Like, I don't understand!

4940
03:25:40,700 --> 03:25:41,440
Oh, my God!

4941
03:25:41,600 --> 03:25:42,840
Where are you going?!

4942
03:25:48,990 --> 03:25:50,270
Oh, my God!

4943
03:25:51,850 --> 03:25:52,430
It's okay.

4944
03:25:52,430 --> 03:25:53,150
I have a rock.

4945
03:25:55,470 --> 03:25:56,230
Oh, my God.

4946
03:25:56,290 --> 03:25:57,470
I'll just let you die from poison.

4947
03:25:57,810 --> 03:25:58,170
Fuck this.

4948
03:25:58,290 --> 03:25:59,210
I hope you're happy.

4949
03:25:59,530 --> 03:26:00,770
I hope you're happy now.

4950
03:26:05,870 --> 03:26:06,510
That's right.

4951
03:26:06,730 --> 03:26:07,830
Die from poison!

4952
03:26:08,410 --> 03:26:09,670
You deserve it!

4953
03:26:10,690 --> 03:26:13,190
Die from the slowest death possible!

4954
03:26:14,350 --> 03:26:15,730
That's fucking red!

4955
03:26:16,150 --> 03:26:16,670
I'm...

4956
03:26:16,670 --> 03:26:17,390
I can wait!

4957
03:26:22,540 --> 03:26:23,620
That's red!

4958
03:26:24,680 --> 03:26:26,560
Oh, my God!

4959
03:26:27,400 --> 03:26:29,040
Oh, my God!

4960
03:26:32,220 --> 03:26:33,900
Okay, that was my bad.

4961
03:26:34,100 --> 03:26:36,240
I thought rock will save me.

4962
03:26:36,700 --> 03:26:37,640
Apparently not.

4963
03:26:37,640 --> 03:26:39,060
Don't fuck this.

4964
03:26:39,320 --> 03:26:40,080
Oh, my God.

4965
03:26:40,240 --> 03:26:41,280
Fuck me, I guess.

4966
03:26:42,720 --> 03:26:43,720
That's right!

4967
03:26:44,000 --> 03:26:45,300
Die from poison!

4968
03:26:45,660 --> 03:26:46,400
I can wait!

4969
03:26:47,360 --> 03:26:48,520
I did it.

4970
03:26:49,740 --> 03:26:50,760
Fuck you!

4971
03:26:51,920 --> 03:26:53,880
Your death was pathetic.

4972
03:26:54,620 --> 03:26:55,640
Thanks for your heart.

4973
03:26:57,520 --> 03:26:58,160
Alright.

4974
03:26:59,020 --> 03:26:59,500
Nice.

4975
03:27:01,120 --> 03:27:01,740
Oh, nice.

4976
03:27:03,200 --> 03:27:04,140
See, guys.

4977
03:27:04,300 --> 03:27:05,740
I win in the end.

4978
03:27:06,220 --> 03:27:06,780
I win in the end.

4979
03:27:10,820 --> 03:27:11,380
Alright.

4980
03:27:12,060 --> 03:27:12,840
I'm back.

4981
03:27:15,140 --> 03:27:16,100
I win.

4982
03:27:16,800 --> 03:27:18,060
We take this.

4983
03:27:20,840 --> 03:27:21,840
In the ruins?

4984
03:27:22,000 --> 03:27:22,120
Here?

4985
03:27:22,240 --> 03:27:23,020
Oh, I know this.

4986
03:27:23,120 --> 03:27:24,080
This was in the night rain.

4987
03:27:25,320 --> 03:27:26,380
I know this area.

4988
03:27:32,170 --> 03:27:33,050
Oh, shit.

4989
03:27:34,490 --> 03:27:35,190
Is it?

4990
03:27:35,270 --> 03:27:35,890
Do I go here?

4991
03:27:44,660 --> 03:27:45,620
There's caves?

4992
03:27:45,980 --> 03:27:47,080
I'm trying to find the cave.

4993
03:27:47,880 --> 03:27:48,320
Wait, what?

4994
03:27:49,060 --> 03:27:50,600
My God fucking...

4995
03:27:50,600 --> 03:27:51,380
Wait, what?

4996
03:27:51,560 --> 03:27:52,540
There's no summons here.

4997
03:27:52,740 --> 03:27:52,880
Oh!

4998
03:27:55,580 --> 03:27:57,700
Go to the castle to farm...

4999
03:28:08,910 --> 03:28:10,050
Oh, it's an NPC.

5000
03:28:10,450 --> 03:28:10,870
Okay.

5001
03:28:11,150 --> 03:28:11,530
Okay.

5002
03:28:11,530 --> 03:28:12,990
I got really scared.

5003
03:28:13,490 --> 03:28:14,050
I...

5004
03:28:14,050 --> 03:28:14,510
I...

5005
03:28:15,050 --> 03:28:15,390
AHHHHH!

5006
03:28:19,460 --> 03:28:19,940
Okay.

5007
03:28:20,500 --> 03:28:21,240
I was like...

5008
03:28:21,240 --> 03:28:21,640
Wait.

5009
03:28:22,060 --> 03:28:22,540
How...

5010
03:28:22,540 --> 03:28:24,040
How can you invade?

5011
03:28:35,590 --> 03:28:36,930
I was gonna be so worried.

5012
03:28:37,050 --> 03:28:38,790
I was like, there's no way you can invade.

5013
03:28:40,650 --> 03:28:42,590
There was no way you could invade.

5014
03:28:42,730 --> 03:28:43,490
Holy shit.

5015
03:28:43,870 --> 03:28:44,490
Holy shit.

5016
03:28:49,410 --> 03:28:49,890
Okay.

5017
03:28:50,050 --> 03:28:50,450
We got him.

5018
03:28:51,230 --> 03:28:51,790
Oh, thank God.

5019
03:28:51,910 --> 03:28:52,350
We got him.

5020
03:28:53,270 --> 03:28:53,630
Nice.

5021
03:28:54,190 --> 03:28:55,030
Oh, thank God.

5022
03:28:55,030 --> 03:28:55,350
Okay.

5023
03:28:55,570 --> 03:28:55,950
That's good.

5024
03:28:56,150 --> 03:28:56,350
That's good.

5025
03:28:56,490 --> 03:28:56,590
That's good.

5026
03:28:56,590 --> 03:28:57,530
I was like...

5027
03:28:59,810 --> 03:29:01,010
How did you...

5028
03:29:01,010 --> 03:29:02,270
How did you get here?

5029
03:29:02,770 --> 03:29:03,730
I didn't...

5030
03:29:03,730 --> 03:29:07,290
I didn't summon dragons just so I could avoid being invaded.

5031
03:29:10,430 --> 03:29:11,650
Oh, there's a cave now.

5032
03:29:17,270 --> 03:29:17,870
Oh.

5033
03:29:18,590 --> 03:29:20,650
I'm in the murk water cave.

5034
03:29:27,480 --> 03:29:28,220
All right.

5035
03:29:29,280 --> 03:29:30,380
I can use this dagger.

5036
03:29:31,040 --> 03:29:33,640
Yeah, but is it better than what I have now, though?

5037
03:29:34,900 --> 03:29:35,600
Group ahead.

5038
03:29:38,260 --> 03:29:40,500
No summoning, so to speak.

5039
03:29:40,640 --> 03:29:41,560
Levels, sword ahead.

5040
03:29:42,480 --> 03:29:43,460
Best friends game?

5041
03:29:43,660 --> 03:29:44,680
Oh my God.

5042
03:29:44,700 --> 03:29:45,060
Friends?

5043
03:29:49,890 --> 03:29:50,950
I don't think he knows.

5044
03:29:51,150 --> 03:29:51,470
I don't think he knows.

5045
03:29:51,470 --> 03:29:52,210
Guys, I think he knows.

5046
03:29:52,650 --> 03:29:52,950
Guys, I think he knows.

5047
03:29:52,950 --> 03:29:55,510
Oh, I'm definitely in the over level for this.

5048
03:29:57,430 --> 03:29:58,210
Wait, what?

5049
03:29:58,490 --> 03:29:59,910
How would he use the bell?

5050
03:30:06,130 --> 03:30:06,690
Wait.

5051
03:30:07,410 --> 03:30:09,550
Where the fuck is the bell coming from?

5052
03:30:12,030 --> 03:30:13,470
I'm gonna fuck this guy.

5053
03:30:15,230 --> 03:30:17,210
Who's ringing the bell right now?

5054
03:30:17,210 --> 03:30:17,310
No.

5055
03:30:18,910 --> 03:30:20,130
Kill them all.

5056
03:30:21,310 --> 03:30:23,170
Oh, it's a trip wire.

5057
03:30:25,310 --> 03:30:26,290
Expecto, dear.

5058
03:30:26,530 --> 03:30:27,650
Wait, did I just come from here?

5059
03:30:29,390 --> 03:30:31,690
No, I came from...

5060
03:30:36,860 --> 03:30:37,540
Ooh.

5061
03:30:42,290 --> 03:30:42,890
Wait, what?

5062
03:30:43,350 --> 03:30:44,830
Oh, it's just moss.

5063
03:30:46,130 --> 03:30:47,470
Weak foe ahead.

5064
03:30:48,530 --> 03:30:49,470
Lover ahead.

5065
03:30:49,590 --> 03:30:50,570
Ooh, lover!

5066
03:30:51,470 --> 03:30:52,850
Hello, lady.

5067
03:30:54,950 --> 03:30:55,570
Hello.

5068
03:30:58,730 --> 03:30:59,970
Any maidens?

5069
03:31:02,450 --> 03:31:03,070
Hello?

5070
03:31:06,530 --> 03:31:07,150
Maiden?

5071
03:31:10,980 --> 03:31:12,640
Oh, am I gonna get fear in?

5072
03:31:18,920 --> 03:31:19,800
Like, what?

5073
03:31:20,000 --> 03:31:20,880
Can I just hit it?

5074
03:31:25,470 --> 03:31:26,390
I'm not...

5075
03:31:26,390 --> 03:31:28,710
You can tell this is a trap!

5076
03:31:32,560 --> 03:31:33,640
Like, what else?

5077
03:31:33,840 --> 03:31:33,980
Oh.

5078
03:31:34,220 --> 03:31:34,680
Oh, it's not.

5079
03:31:35,460 --> 03:31:35,740
Oh.

5080
03:31:40,140 --> 03:31:41,340
Oh, it wasn't a trap.

5081
03:31:41,720 --> 03:31:43,480
Oh, it wasn't a trap.

5082
03:31:43,940 --> 03:31:44,420
Oh.

5083
03:31:44,420 --> 03:31:45,080
Oh, there he is.

5084
03:31:46,900 --> 03:31:47,680
Oh, it's...

5085
03:31:47,680 --> 03:31:49,060
Oh, it's Patches!

5086
03:31:49,680 --> 03:31:50,680
Oh, my God!

5087
03:31:50,880 --> 03:31:51,960
Wait, you're here?

5088
03:31:53,260 --> 03:31:54,220
Wait, Patches?

5089
03:31:55,780 --> 03:31:57,160
Oh, my God!

5090
03:31:58,100 --> 03:31:58,460
I...

5091
03:31:58,820 --> 03:32:00,120
Goodbye, Patches!

5092
03:32:00,700 --> 03:32:01,420
I...

5093
03:32:03,260 --> 03:32:04,700
Goodbye, Patches!

5094
03:32:04,900 --> 03:32:06,820
Go back to Bloodborne!

5095
03:32:09,480 --> 03:32:10,680
Oh, yeah, nice.

5096
03:32:12,440 --> 03:32:13,780
Oh, dang, you killed him.

5097
03:32:13,960 --> 03:32:14,160
Oh.

5098
03:32:15,220 --> 03:32:15,700
Whoops.

5099
03:32:17,440 --> 03:32:18,640
Oh, I...

5100
03:32:18,640 --> 03:32:20,640
Guys, I was too strong.

5101
03:32:28,440 --> 03:32:31,220
I was a little too strong.

5102
03:32:31,280 --> 03:32:32,520
I died.

5103
03:32:34,680 --> 03:32:35,440
Whoops.

5104
03:32:39,500 --> 03:32:40,260
Okay!

5105
03:32:41,240 --> 03:32:43,320
It took me four hits!

5106
03:32:43,500 --> 03:32:45,040
How was I supposed to know?

5107
03:32:45,040 --> 03:32:48,040
You could have said that before I killed...

5108
03:32:48,600 --> 03:32:50,700
Before I did four hits on him.

5109
03:32:51,140 --> 03:32:51,660
I...

5110
03:32:54,940 --> 03:32:56,640
You know I don't wait.

5111
03:32:57,040 --> 03:32:59,660
I kill first, then ask questions later.

5112
03:33:03,080 --> 03:33:06,180
Rest in peace, Patches, Bloodline.

5113
03:33:06,740 --> 03:33:07,700
He leered.

5114
03:33:07,920 --> 03:33:08,360
Okay!

5115
03:33:08,680 --> 03:33:09,860
We all saw him!

5116
03:33:10,000 --> 03:33:11,960
He's trying to stab me first!

5117
03:33:13,280 --> 03:33:13,920
He...

5118
03:33:13,920 --> 03:33:15,200
He started it!

5119
03:33:15,580 --> 03:33:16,200
Whoops.

5120
03:33:19,500 --> 03:33:20,140
Um...

5121
03:33:20,380 --> 03:33:22,400
Guess we're not getting Patches.

5122
03:33:22,660 --> 03:33:27,520
I'm not saying I deserve that because at least I made him grovel and kiss your feet first.

5123
03:33:27,520 --> 03:33:29,400
Thank you for the super chat.

5124
03:33:29,600 --> 03:33:30,540
Thank you, thank you.

5125
03:33:31,160 --> 03:33:31,800
Well...

5126
03:33:31,800 --> 03:33:33,000
That's unlucky.

5127
03:33:35,660 --> 03:33:36,600
It's alright.

5128
03:33:36,860 --> 03:33:37,200
How...

5129
03:33:37,200 --> 03:33:38,220
Can't be that important.

5130
03:33:38,420 --> 03:33:39,140
It's Patches.

5131
03:33:39,700 --> 03:33:40,700
Right, guys?

5132
03:33:42,340 --> 03:33:44,740
Can't be that important, guys.

5133
03:33:45,000 --> 03:33:45,140
Right?

5134
03:33:46,420 --> 03:33:47,700
It's Patches.

5135
03:33:53,160 --> 03:33:55,900
Is it really that important if it's Patches, though?

5136
03:33:58,900 --> 03:34:00,660
I can't believe it.

5137
03:34:03,040 --> 03:34:03,740
It's fine.

5138
03:34:03,900 --> 03:34:04,840
You're all so weak, anyway.

5139
03:34:12,060 --> 03:34:14,480
Like, what is he gonna do, anyway?

5140
03:34:14,640 --> 03:34:15,460
Betray me?

5141
03:34:15,600 --> 03:34:16,920
Like, all L the others?

5142
03:34:21,700 --> 03:34:22,960
That's all they do.

5143
03:34:23,780 --> 03:34:26,980
He was just gonna betray me, and you know it.

5144
03:34:36,220 --> 03:34:36,520
Alright.

5145
03:34:42,680 --> 03:34:43,680
Wait, where...

5146
03:34:43,680 --> 03:34:44,580
Oh my gosh, I'm...

5147
03:34:44,580 --> 03:34:46,280
Oh, I can revive him with a turtle pup?

5148
03:34:46,440 --> 03:34:46,760
Don't worry.

5149
03:34:47,200 --> 03:34:48,340
The pup will save me.

5150
03:34:48,820 --> 03:34:50,080
He'll forgive me.

5151
03:34:50,620 --> 03:34:52,100
All will be forgiven.

5152
03:34:53,200 --> 03:34:54,180
Oh my god.

5153
03:34:54,820 --> 03:34:55,660
Where am I?

5154
03:35:04,740 --> 03:35:06,720
Turtle pup will save me.

5155
03:35:11,510 --> 03:35:13,490
He'll surely forgive me.

5156
03:35:14,210 --> 03:35:15,570
Wait, can I actually...

5157
03:35:15,570 --> 03:35:16,130
Oh, wait.

5158
03:35:16,290 --> 03:35:16,770
I can't?

5159
03:35:17,410 --> 03:35:20,750
What's the point of having a poop if you can't revive him?

5160
03:35:24,700 --> 03:35:26,020
Oh, we gotta go now.

5161
03:35:34,360 --> 03:35:36,660
Guys, I remember what he did in Bloodborne.

5162
03:35:36,940 --> 03:35:37,540
I'm sorry.

5163
03:35:38,780 --> 03:35:39,560
I remember...

5164
03:35:39,560 --> 03:35:40,080
But I...

5165
03:35:40,080 --> 03:35:41,080
I never forget.

5166
03:35:44,300 --> 03:35:44,860
Exactly.

5167
03:35:45,360 --> 03:35:48,420
It's not a sin to kill Patches, guys.

5168
03:35:48,420 --> 03:35:50,420
It's Patches.

5169
03:35:52,960 --> 03:35:53,860
Oh yeah.

5170
03:35:57,060 --> 03:35:58,240
Never forget.

5171
03:35:59,040 --> 03:36:01,200
You fought Nereus and survived.

5172
03:36:02,400 --> 03:36:04,560
That alone deserves commendation.

5173
03:36:05,320 --> 03:36:05,700
I am you.

5174
03:36:07,440 --> 03:36:08,980
Hunter of bloody fingers.

5175
03:36:09,720 --> 03:36:10,300
Tarnished.

5176
03:36:10,760 --> 03:36:12,460
Held in thrall by cessblood.

5177
03:36:13,740 --> 03:36:14,320
Zealots.

5178
03:36:14,440 --> 03:36:15,540
What was his path sin?

5179
03:36:15,800 --> 03:36:17,180
By being Patches.

5180
03:36:19,440 --> 03:36:21,240
You're certain to face more of them.

5181
03:36:21,800 --> 03:36:24,690
Just remember...

5182
03:36:24,690 --> 03:36:26,650
No kinship with their elk remains.

5183
03:36:29,330 --> 03:36:31,410
Their madness precludes it.

5184
03:36:34,590 --> 03:36:36,890
Don't let your emotions stay oblade.

5185
03:36:38,590 --> 03:36:39,230
Huh?

5186
03:36:39,530 --> 03:36:40,250
Be on your way.

5187
03:36:40,310 --> 03:36:41,130
Perhaps we will meet.

5188
03:36:41,270 --> 03:36:41,830
Okay.

5189
03:36:42,170 --> 03:36:42,550
Goodbye.

5190
03:36:44,190 --> 03:36:44,690
Goodbye.

5191
03:36:45,550 --> 03:36:46,130
Nice talk.

5192
03:36:51,060 --> 03:36:52,120
Where am I?

5193
03:36:55,200 --> 03:36:57,520
I guess I'll head east still.

5194
03:36:58,660 --> 03:36:59,140
Oh, item!

5195
03:37:01,060 --> 03:37:01,660
Yay!

5196
03:37:05,220 --> 03:37:06,060
What's that?

5197
03:37:06,860 --> 03:37:07,740
Wait, oh.

5198
03:37:08,320 --> 03:37:09,400
I bet they're weak though.

5199
03:37:09,960 --> 03:37:10,100
Yeah.

5200
03:37:10,500 --> 03:37:12,340
I'm way too over level for this area.

5201
03:37:12,860 --> 03:37:13,540
For sure.

5202
03:37:13,840 --> 03:37:14,600
Oh shit!

5203
03:37:16,160 --> 03:37:17,300
What the fuck?

5204
03:37:17,500 --> 03:37:19,100
Why is that so tanky?

5205
03:37:21,620 --> 03:37:22,640
What the fuck?

5206
03:37:23,640 --> 03:37:24,100
Oh...

5207
03:37:24,100 --> 03:37:25,110
They get rezzed.

5208
03:37:26,100 --> 03:37:26,560
Oh...

5209
03:37:26,560 --> 03:37:27,280
Do I have to...

5210
03:37:27,280 --> 03:37:28,420
Oh my god!

5211
03:37:28,700 --> 03:37:30,100
Okay, give me a sec guys.

5212
03:37:30,340 --> 03:37:31,320
There's too many of you!

5213
03:37:31,440 --> 03:37:32,520
There's too many of you!

5214
03:37:32,900 --> 03:37:33,020
There's too many of you!

5215
03:37:35,060 --> 03:37:36,580
Okay, I have to double hit them.

5216
03:37:36,740 --> 03:37:38,100
Oh, they're the double hitters.

5217
03:37:38,540 --> 03:37:39,420
I see.

5218
03:37:41,940 --> 03:37:43,240
It's the double hitters.

5219
03:37:43,400 --> 03:37:43,800
But it's okay.

5220
03:37:43,980 --> 03:37:46,000
I can just get this guy up first.

5221
03:37:48,180 --> 03:37:48,960
Okay.

5222
03:37:49,140 --> 03:37:49,700
That's fine.

5223
03:37:51,620 --> 03:37:53,120
They are weak.

5224
03:37:53,650 --> 03:37:56,760
I just forgot that these guys can get revived.

5225
03:37:58,500 --> 03:37:59,840
Spirit jumping.

5226
03:38:00,820 --> 03:38:01,200
Oh.

5227
03:38:01,600 --> 03:38:01,740
Okay.

5228
03:38:02,520 --> 03:38:03,620
Press A after that.

5229
03:38:05,240 --> 03:38:06,860
Okay, that's the other cave.

5230
03:38:07,780 --> 03:38:09,560
Jesus fucking Christ!

5231
03:38:12,140 --> 03:38:13,180
Oh my god!

5232
03:38:13,300 --> 03:38:14,120
It was too short!

5233
03:38:15,360 --> 03:38:16,640
It's too short!

5234
03:38:16,900 --> 03:38:17,940
Look at him!

5235
03:38:18,100 --> 03:38:18,850
He's cheating!

5236
03:38:19,720 --> 03:38:21,040
He's actually...

5237
03:38:21,040 --> 03:38:21,820
He's cheating!

5238
03:38:21,980 --> 03:38:22,700
He's like...

5239
03:38:22,700 --> 03:38:24,120
Fucking on the ground!

5240
03:38:27,340 --> 03:38:28,740
He's actually cheating.

5241
03:38:32,080 --> 03:38:32,740
Like...

5242
03:38:32,740 --> 03:38:34,200
What the fuck is that?

5243
03:38:40,110 --> 03:38:41,410
Alright, it's fine.

5244
03:38:44,630 --> 03:38:45,070
I...

5245
03:38:45,070 --> 03:38:46,010
Just fuck her.

5246
03:38:46,130 --> 03:38:46,490
That's...

5247
03:38:46,490 --> 03:38:47,170
Oh my god!

5248
03:38:47,290 --> 03:38:49,450
And then the mosquito just was like, I want to join too.

5249
03:38:50,790 --> 03:38:51,810
Alright, where are you?

5250
03:38:52,630 --> 03:38:53,510
Where are you?

5251
03:38:54,110 --> 03:38:55,230
Get out of here!

5252
03:38:59,360 --> 03:39:00,240
Try fire?

5253
03:39:00,460 --> 03:39:01,640
Oh, is it on these guys?

5254
03:39:02,200 --> 03:39:04,020
Oh, I don't have any fire weapon though.

5255
03:39:04,560 --> 03:39:05,000
Let's...

5256
03:39:05,000 --> 03:39:06,080
Let's start wailing them.

5257
03:39:06,980 --> 03:39:08,600
I don't really have anything else to do.

5258
03:39:10,200 --> 03:39:10,880
I don't.

5259
03:39:11,060 --> 03:39:11,780
I don't have...

5260
03:39:12,960 --> 03:39:13,480
Unfortunately.

5261
03:39:15,800 --> 03:39:16,320
Man.

5262
03:39:17,060 --> 03:39:17,580
Alright.

5263
03:39:17,820 --> 03:39:18,920
I know the pattern though.

5264
03:39:19,400 --> 03:39:20,260
I figured it out.

5265
03:39:22,420 --> 03:39:23,700
God, there's so many.

5266
03:39:24,620 --> 03:39:25,140
Wait.

5267
03:39:25,440 --> 03:39:26,920
Can I just use a torch on them?

5268
03:39:27,460 --> 03:39:28,240
Okay, I'll try.

5269
03:39:33,360 --> 03:39:33,880
Oh.

5270
03:39:40,490 --> 03:39:41,010
Okay.

5271
03:39:44,310 --> 03:39:45,470
Does it do anything?

5272
03:39:46,230 --> 03:39:47,930
Guys, I don't think it does anything.

5273
03:39:52,700 --> 03:39:53,180
Guys.

5274
03:39:53,900 --> 03:39:56,260
Yeah, that did not do anything.

5275
03:39:56,560 --> 03:39:57,460
Let me just...

5276
03:39:57,460 --> 03:39:59,320
Let me just keep using this weapon.

5277
03:39:59,620 --> 03:40:01,680
I have a feeling that did nothing.

5278
03:40:04,580 --> 03:40:05,420
Oh my god.

5279
03:40:05,500 --> 03:40:06,140
I'm gonna kill this track.

5280
03:40:06,680 --> 03:40:07,160
I...

5281
03:40:07,160 --> 03:40:07,460
Oh.

5282
03:40:08,140 --> 03:40:08,740
Oh.

5283
03:40:10,180 --> 03:40:11,000
Here we go.

5284
03:40:13,060 --> 03:40:14,080
Am I two-handed?

5285
03:40:14,420 --> 03:40:16,060
I don't think I can two-handed yet.

5286
03:40:19,760 --> 03:40:20,360
Yeah.

5287
03:40:20,600 --> 03:40:20,800
No.

5288
03:40:21,300 --> 03:40:21,880
No.

5289
03:40:22,680 --> 03:40:23,280
It's useless.

5290
03:40:24,080 --> 03:40:25,260
The regular...

5291
03:40:25,260 --> 03:40:27,260
The regular katana does more.

5292
03:40:27,540 --> 03:40:28,720
Just from bleed alone.

5293
03:40:31,360 --> 03:40:33,020
No, the katana does more.

5294
03:40:35,260 --> 03:40:36,960
Just from the bleed in general.

5295
03:40:39,520 --> 03:40:40,780
No door ahead.

5296
03:40:41,420 --> 03:40:42,220
What do you mean?

5297
03:40:47,800 --> 03:40:49,120
Oh, it's a dungeon!

5298
03:40:49,580 --> 03:40:50,040
Nice.

5299
03:40:50,500 --> 03:40:52,340
Oh, it might be a really weak dungeon too.

5300
03:40:53,960 --> 03:40:54,760
The dagger?

5301
03:40:55,360 --> 03:40:58,380
Was the dagger really better than my katana though?

5302
03:41:00,800 --> 03:41:03,600
My katana is just so much better in general.

5303
03:41:04,100 --> 03:41:04,660
Oh yeah, me.

5304
03:41:04,820 --> 03:41:05,700
I can upgrade again.

5305
03:41:09,190 --> 03:41:10,190
I'll use two.

5306
03:41:10,930 --> 03:41:12,550
I think it's like...

5307
03:41:12,550 --> 03:41:12,970
400.

5308
03:41:13,590 --> 03:41:14,150
Right?

5309
03:41:21,790 --> 03:41:23,110
Mixed up bleed fast?

5310
03:41:23,430 --> 03:41:24,350
Alright, I'll try it out.

5311
03:41:24,950 --> 03:41:26,390
Oh, it's 12k.

5312
03:41:27,110 --> 03:41:27,270
Okay.

5313
03:41:30,740 --> 03:41:32,100
Yeah, you need to use two.

5314
03:41:36,380 --> 03:41:37,380
Alright, there we go.

5315
03:41:43,100 --> 03:41:43,660
Uh...

5316
03:41:43,660 --> 03:41:44,160
Bigger.

5317
03:41:45,340 --> 03:41:46,380
Okay, I'll try it out.

5318
03:41:50,630 --> 03:41:51,190
Inventory.

5319
03:41:51,490 --> 03:41:51,990
Equipment.

5320
03:41:51,990 --> 03:41:53,250
I'll try it out.

5321
03:41:54,250 --> 03:41:55,250
Is it called?

5322
03:41:56,770 --> 03:41:57,610
This one?

5323
03:41:59,550 --> 03:42:00,810
Wait, I'm not...

5324
03:42:02,770 --> 03:42:04,370
What do I need for it?

5325
03:42:06,590 --> 03:42:08,090
Oh, I need arcane.

5326
03:42:08,090 --> 03:42:09,730
I don't have enough arcane though.

5327
03:42:09,990 --> 03:42:10,510
Guys.

5328
03:42:15,940 --> 03:42:16,960
That's you, bitch.

5329
03:42:17,980 --> 03:42:18,640
That's right.

5330
03:42:18,900 --> 03:42:20,120
Haha, I saw you.

5331
03:42:24,080 --> 03:42:24,920
Oh my god.

5332
03:42:26,100 --> 03:42:28,700
You shouldn't be allowed to- OH MY GOD!

5333
03:42:32,210 --> 03:42:32,850
Bro!

5334
03:42:33,190 --> 03:42:34,610
Did anyone get the license plate?

5335
03:42:39,560 --> 03:42:41,260
There's more of you!

5336
03:42:41,960 --> 03:42:44,120
There's more of you!

5337
03:42:46,340 --> 03:42:47,140
Guys!

5338
03:42:47,400 --> 03:42:48,640
What was the license plate?

5339
03:42:49,460 --> 03:42:51,400
I didn't even call the police.

5340
03:42:54,900 --> 03:42:55,700
Alright.

5341
03:42:56,100 --> 03:42:56,780
We're fine.

5342
03:42:57,540 --> 03:42:58,880
Tom, do you have a super shot?

5343
03:42:59,020 --> 03:42:59,340
Do you think?

5344
03:42:59,580 --> 03:43:00,820
Oh, I'm glad you like the mod!

5345
03:43:01,000 --> 03:43:01,980
The new skin suit!

5346
03:43:02,860 --> 03:43:04,220
Oh my god.

5347
03:43:06,560 --> 03:43:08,060
Oh my god.

5348
03:43:09,940 --> 03:43:11,300
Oh my god.

5349
03:43:11,420 --> 03:43:12,140
Get out of here.

5350
03:43:12,740 --> 03:43:14,320
Actually, get out of here.

5351
03:43:15,800 --> 03:43:17,140
I know there's one more.

5352
03:43:19,360 --> 03:43:21,160
I'm just- That's fine.

5353
03:43:21,740 --> 03:43:22,180
Boom.

5354
03:43:22,800 --> 03:43:24,520
Okay, I need to get this item out though.

5355
03:43:26,280 --> 03:43:27,880
Yeah, the roll is too fat.

5356
03:43:33,740 --> 03:43:34,500
What's this do?

5357
03:43:37,880 --> 03:43:38,320
Oh.

5358
03:43:38,580 --> 03:43:40,080
Okay, I already unlocked the boss room.

5359
03:43:40,240 --> 03:43:40,900
Oh, that's easy.

5360
03:43:44,320 --> 03:43:44,760
What?

5361
03:43:45,980 --> 03:43:47,480
Oh, it's a trap!

5362
03:43:48,400 --> 03:43:49,900
Wait, do I have a lance equipped?

5363
03:43:50,280 --> 03:43:51,920
Why do I have a lance equipped, guys?

5364
03:43:53,740 --> 03:43:54,980
Oh, you mean the shield?

5365
03:44:00,230 --> 03:44:01,190
Oh, damn.

5366
03:44:02,230 --> 03:44:02,950
Beware of a trap.

5367
03:44:03,070 --> 03:44:04,070
Oh, this must be a trap.

5368
03:44:06,550 --> 03:44:07,250
That's right.

5369
03:44:07,430 --> 03:44:08,810
You don't- Okay, nevermind.

5370
03:44:09,410 --> 03:44:10,910
Okay, you might- Okay, okay.

5371
03:44:11,110 --> 03:44:11,470
Oh!

5372
03:44:17,450 --> 03:44:20,330
I got- I got ganked in the alleyway.

5373
03:44:20,850 --> 03:44:23,170
I went- I went into murder alleyway.

5374
03:44:23,310 --> 03:44:25,250
And got fucking Bruce Wayne.

5375
03:44:27,230 --> 03:44:31,170
I got- I went into murder- Crime alley.

5376
03:44:32,690 --> 03:44:34,730
Fucking goddamn crime alley.

5377
03:44:40,670 --> 03:44:42,490
Oh my god, I hate these guys.

5378
03:44:42,930 --> 03:44:45,330
I- I- Oh my god.

5379
03:44:45,530 --> 03:44:46,330
I hate all of them.

5380
03:44:46,970 --> 03:44:47,730
Get out of here.

5381
03:44:52,380 --> 03:44:54,100
Okay, I'm getting my stuff back.

5382
03:44:55,240 --> 03:44:56,560
Stupid crime alley.

5383
03:44:59,640 --> 03:45:01,840
I can't believe it's happening again!

5384
03:45:02,340 --> 03:45:02,820
I can't believe it's happening again!

5385
03:45:03,820 --> 03:45:05,100
Oh my god!

5386
03:45:20,960 --> 03:45:22,840
Why are you so fast?!

5387
03:45:24,680 --> 03:45:25,980
It's okay, I'm okay.

5388
03:45:26,480 --> 03:45:27,400
I'm okay.

5389
03:45:27,740 --> 03:45:28,400
I'm okay.

5390
03:45:29,120 --> 03:45:30,000
I'm okay.

5391
03:45:30,000 --> 03:45:31,200
I'm- I'm so healthy.

5392
03:45:32,260 --> 03:45:34,020
Alright, time to fight him.

5393
03:45:35,700 --> 03:45:37,460
I'm- I'm okay.

5394
03:45:37,740 --> 03:45:38,600
I'm okay.

5395
03:45:39,120 --> 03:45:42,240
Try two-handing and then try jump attack, alright?

5396
03:45:43,160 --> 03:45:44,200
I survived.

5397
03:45:45,000 --> 03:45:46,480
My death was over-exaggerated.

5398
03:45:54,800 --> 03:45:55,940
Oh shit!

5399
03:45:57,760 --> 03:45:58,900
Oh my god.

5400
03:45:58,980 --> 03:46:00,780
Oh my god.

5401
03:46:01,000 --> 03:46:01,100
Oh my god.

5402
03:46:01,860 --> 03:46:05,640
Guys, I wanted to- I wanted to try the two-hand, okay?

5403
03:46:08,360 --> 03:46:09,420
That's fucking right.

5404
03:46:09,740 --> 03:46:10,280
Ha ha ha!

5405
03:46:10,580 --> 03:46:12,360
I'm so over-leveled!

5406
03:46:12,680 --> 03:46:13,540
Ha ha ha ha!

5407
03:46:13,980 --> 03:46:14,820
That's right!

5408
03:46:15,140 --> 03:46:16,460
I'm so over-leveled!

5409
03:46:17,520 --> 03:46:18,080
Yeah!

5410
03:46:19,020 --> 03:46:20,080
Ha ha ha ha!

5411
03:46:21,840 --> 03:46:22,400
Easy.

5412
03:46:23,520 --> 03:46:23,900
Alright.

5413
03:46:24,240 --> 03:46:25,240
Are there any items here?

5414
03:46:26,160 --> 03:46:26,860
Ha ha ha!

5415
03:46:26,980 --> 03:46:28,740
You can't do nothing about that.

5416
03:46:30,240 --> 03:46:34,000
Oh my god, I killed so many bosses and none of them were the story bosses.

5417
03:46:34,340 --> 03:46:36,200
Oh my god, he only give 2k!

5418
03:46:36,600 --> 03:46:38,460
That's how under-leveled he was.

5419
03:46:41,810 --> 03:46:44,030
The goblins were so much harder.

5420
03:46:44,290 --> 03:46:45,010
No, it's true.

5421
03:46:45,250 --> 03:46:45,950
They were.

5422
03:46:47,090 --> 03:46:47,910
Oh no.

5423
03:46:48,630 --> 03:46:49,730
Not these guys.

5424
03:46:54,190 --> 03:46:55,370
Yeah, I gotta go here.

5425
03:47:02,130 --> 03:47:02,570
Whee!

5426
03:47:03,450 --> 03:47:04,370
Oh hey, Grace!

5427
03:47:05,030 --> 03:47:06,070
I actually need that.

5428
03:47:08,570 --> 03:47:10,650
Let me kill these guys for more arrows though.

5429
03:47:11,290 --> 03:47:11,930
Get over here.

5430
03:47:12,530 --> 03:47:13,430
Get your ass over here.

5431
03:47:13,990 --> 03:47:15,810
Oh my god, you think you'll live?

5432
03:47:15,930 --> 03:47:17,690
Just cause I missed my first slash?

5433
03:47:18,270 --> 03:47:18,810
Ha ha ha!

5434
03:47:19,050 --> 03:47:19,550
That's fucking right.

5435
03:47:19,670 --> 03:47:20,450
Give me your bones.

5436
03:47:22,770 --> 03:47:23,210
Oh?

5437
03:47:23,210 --> 03:47:24,570
Oh, I got the painting.

5438
03:47:26,890 --> 03:47:27,310
Tranquility.

5439
03:47:30,550 --> 03:47:31,310
Oh, wait.

5440
03:47:31,430 --> 03:47:31,950
Where's the Grace?

5441
03:47:34,410 --> 03:47:34,990
Oh, there.

5442
03:47:35,530 --> 03:47:36,350
There it is.

5443
03:47:40,950 --> 03:47:41,370
Uh...

5444
03:47:41,370 --> 03:47:42,570
Let's get healed real fast.

5445
03:47:48,760 --> 03:47:49,180
Uh...

5446
03:47:49,180 --> 03:47:49,700
Let's see.

5447
03:47:49,800 --> 03:47:51,120
Oh wait, is this where you get the map?

5448
03:47:51,360 --> 03:47:51,980
Is that it?

5449
03:47:53,660 --> 03:47:55,260
That's where you get the next map, right?

5450
03:48:00,830 --> 03:48:02,490
I'll go to that big tree right here?

5451
03:48:04,130 --> 03:48:05,170
Yeah, I'm trying to...

5452
03:48:05,170 --> 03:48:06,350
I wanna get to this map.

5453
03:48:07,990 --> 03:48:08,370
Okay.

5454
03:48:12,860 --> 03:48:14,720
Guys, I'm getting better at the Elden Ring.

5455
03:48:16,680 --> 03:48:17,120
Whee!

5456
03:48:31,360 --> 03:48:32,080
Whee!

5457
03:48:35,480 --> 03:48:37,060
Let's get my solos back.

5458
03:48:44,160 --> 03:48:45,920
It didn't look that high.

5459
03:48:46,260 --> 03:48:47,020
I don't know.

5460
03:48:47,200 --> 03:48:47,820
I thought...

5461
03:48:48,080 --> 03:48:50,340
I thought it looked perfectly...

5462
03:48:52,400 --> 03:48:54,780
It looked like a normal jump.

5463
03:48:54,780 --> 03:48:55,680
That's...

5464
03:48:55,680 --> 03:48:56,820
There we go.

5465
03:48:57,020 --> 03:48:58,400
At least that worked.

5466
03:49:01,360 --> 03:49:04,660
It looked like such a normal jump.

5467
03:49:05,020 --> 03:49:07,540
I thought my horse could take it.

5468
03:49:07,700 --> 03:49:07,980
You know?

5469
03:49:08,320 --> 03:49:10,260
I thought I could Yoshi it.

5470
03:49:15,680 --> 03:49:17,780
I don't know why.

5471
03:49:22,640 --> 03:49:25,000
It looked so Yoshi-able.

5472
03:49:34,050 --> 03:49:34,750
Oh.

5473
03:49:38,690 --> 03:49:39,410
Alright.

5474
03:49:39,710 --> 03:49:41,230
This should be where the map is.

5475
03:49:42,290 --> 03:49:43,670
We're almost there.

5476
03:49:46,430 --> 03:49:48,230
Wait, is that a boss?

5477
03:49:49,050 --> 03:49:51,170
Are you a boss or a regular guy?

5478
03:49:51,990 --> 03:49:52,670
Oh.

5479
03:49:52,670 --> 03:49:52,730
Oh.

5480
03:49:53,410 --> 03:49:54,710
Oh no, they're regular.

5481
03:49:54,930 --> 03:49:56,550
There's like five of them up around me.

5482
03:49:57,230 --> 03:49:57,730
Okay.

5483
03:49:59,560 --> 03:50:00,990
Okay, they're just regular people.

5484
03:50:03,560 --> 03:50:04,510
Alright, we got the map.

5485
03:50:04,930 --> 03:50:05,850
Map found.

5486
03:50:06,590 --> 03:50:07,590
I guess...

5487
03:50:07,590 --> 03:50:09,350
Oh, that looks like a scarlet area.

5488
03:50:10,450 --> 03:50:11,030
That...

5489
03:50:11,030 --> 03:50:13,490
Yeah, that looks like a scarlet area.

5490
03:50:13,670 --> 03:50:14,310
Wait, what's this?

5491
03:50:15,590 --> 03:50:16,170
Riverwell?

5492
03:50:20,580 --> 03:50:21,310
What is this?

5493
03:50:27,930 --> 03:50:28,510
Oh.

5494
03:50:30,610 --> 03:50:31,510
What is this?

5495
03:50:31,610 --> 03:50:32,290
It's so pretty!

5496
03:50:32,690 --> 03:50:33,810
What is this area?

5497
03:50:34,450 --> 03:50:35,770
It's really pretty, though.

5498
03:50:37,090 --> 03:50:38,770
Oh, it's very, very deep.

5499
03:50:44,380 --> 03:50:46,500
Yeah, the longest elevator in the world.

5500
03:50:46,660 --> 03:50:48,120
There should be some elevator music.

5501
03:50:51,820 --> 03:50:53,380
How far does it go?

5502
03:50:54,740 --> 03:50:56,080
What the fuck?

5503
03:50:56,440 --> 03:50:58,520
There's still more?!

5504
03:51:03,050 --> 03:51:04,450
Wait, is this...

5505
03:51:09,330 --> 03:51:11,870
Oh my god, I don't know if I like this area anymore.

5506
03:51:13,970 --> 03:51:14,850
It seems...

5507
03:51:17,610 --> 03:51:20,050
Feels like there's a lot of things that's gonna be hiding.

5508
03:51:22,410 --> 03:51:24,210
Oh, thank god, there's a graze here.

5509
03:51:26,450 --> 03:51:27,910
Dung required a head?

5510
03:51:28,130 --> 03:51:28,790
Wait, why?

5511
03:51:31,190 --> 03:51:31,710
What?

5512
03:51:32,290 --> 03:51:33,010
He's pretty!

5513
03:51:40,550 --> 03:51:41,330
Look up?

5514
03:51:41,550 --> 03:51:42,290
Look up where?

5515
03:51:43,890 --> 03:51:44,390
That?

5516
03:51:47,290 --> 03:51:48,730
What am I looking up for?

5517
03:51:56,240 --> 03:51:57,720
What am I looking up for?

5518
03:51:59,880 --> 03:52:01,380
Oh, just a nice view.

5519
03:52:01,380 --> 03:52:02,040
I was like...

5520
03:52:02,040 --> 03:52:02,860
Is there something here?

5521
03:52:10,180 --> 03:52:10,780
Oh...

5522
03:52:10,780 --> 03:52:12,480
Is there a boss here?

5523
03:52:15,260 --> 03:52:16,140
Oh, nice.

5524
03:52:16,260 --> 03:52:16,680
Runes.

5525
03:52:18,720 --> 03:52:19,320
Oh...

5526
03:52:19,320 --> 03:52:20,200
Where are the enemies?

5527
03:52:22,740 --> 03:52:24,020
More runes.

5528
03:52:24,300 --> 03:52:24,420
More runes.

5529
03:52:24,420 --> 03:52:24,760
Yippee!

5530
03:52:32,240 --> 03:52:32,920
Hmm...

5531
03:52:32,920 --> 03:52:34,200
Try horseback battle?

5532
03:52:34,400 --> 03:52:34,840
For what?

5533
03:52:36,040 --> 03:52:36,720
Why?

5534
03:52:37,120 --> 03:52:38,760
Oh, there's a guy right here.

5535
03:52:39,280 --> 03:52:42,160
Somebody's trying horseback battles right now.

5536
03:52:43,840 --> 03:52:44,520
Oh...

5537
03:52:44,520 --> 03:52:45,360
These guys.

5538
03:52:47,920 --> 03:52:49,460
Now I can take them.

5539
03:52:49,920 --> 03:52:51,400
I don't need to try some...

5540
03:52:51,400 --> 03:52:51,920
Watch this!

5541
03:52:55,860 --> 03:52:56,380
Oh...

5542
03:52:56,380 --> 03:52:57,560
Oh, wait.

5543
03:52:57,880 --> 03:52:59,280
Wait, they're really tanky.

5544
03:53:00,620 --> 03:53:01,580
Wait a minute.

5545
03:53:02,800 --> 03:53:03,960
Wait a minute.

5546
03:53:04,420 --> 03:53:05,680
Wait, are these like...

5547
03:53:05,680 --> 03:53:07,960
Do I need the mace for this, guys?

5548
03:53:10,140 --> 03:53:11,740
Guys, do I need the mace?

5549
03:53:12,160 --> 03:53:13,000
For this?

5550
03:53:13,740 --> 03:53:16,120
Yeah, they look like stone people.

5551
03:53:17,000 --> 03:53:18,160
Alright, give me a sec.

5552
03:53:20,940 --> 03:53:21,460
Alright.

5553
03:53:21,800 --> 03:53:23,000
Don't worry, I got this.

5554
03:53:24,840 --> 03:53:27,320
I'm just swapping weapons real quick.

5555
03:53:30,980 --> 03:53:31,980
That's right.

5556
03:53:32,720 --> 03:53:34,500
Now I'm ready to smash!

5557
03:53:35,860 --> 03:53:36,600
Who are they?

5558
03:53:39,320 --> 03:53:40,260
That's right.

5559
03:53:40,860 --> 03:53:41,980
I'm ready.

5560
03:53:44,120 --> 03:53:44,860
Boom!

5561
03:53:45,220 --> 03:53:46,100
Wait, wait a minute.

5562
03:53:46,580 --> 03:53:47,480
Wait a minute.

5563
03:53:48,300 --> 03:53:49,480
Wait a minute.

5564
03:53:49,480 --> 03:53:50,480
That...

5565
03:54:00,000 --> 03:54:00,940
That...

5566
03:54:00,940 --> 03:54:02,720
Does not do that much damage.

5567
03:54:06,000 --> 03:54:06,940
Um...

5568
03:54:10,680 --> 03:54:11,100
Hmm...

5569
03:54:12,600 --> 03:54:13,020
Hmm...

5570
03:54:13,020 --> 03:54:13,480
Hmm...

5571
03:54:13,480 --> 03:54:13,560
Hmm...

5572
03:54:13,560 --> 03:54:13,600
Hmm...

5573
03:54:13,600 --> 03:54:13,940
Hmm...

5574
03:54:13,940 --> 03:54:14,020
Hmm...

5575
03:54:14,020 --> 03:54:15,200
Alright, I'm just gonna ride...

5576
03:54:15,200 --> 03:54:15,560
You know what?

5577
03:54:15,600 --> 03:54:16,140
They were right.

5578
03:54:16,400 --> 03:54:18,120
Let me just ride past them.

5579
03:54:23,060 --> 03:54:23,780
Maybe...

5580
03:54:23,780 --> 03:54:25,500
Yeah, I'm just gonna...

5581
03:54:25,500 --> 03:54:26,860
Yeah, I'm just gonna...

5582
03:54:26,860 --> 03:54:27,220
Goodbye.

5583
03:54:28,400 --> 03:54:28,860
Goodbye.

5584
03:54:30,940 --> 03:54:32,240
Hey, what's over here?

5585
03:54:34,100 --> 03:54:35,440
Why do I get up there?

5586
03:54:35,960 --> 03:54:37,320
Oh, it's like... I jumped.

5587
03:54:37,920 --> 03:54:38,280
Goodbye.

5588
03:54:40,120 --> 03:54:40,840
Goodbye.

5589
03:54:42,060 --> 03:54:42,820
Bye-bye.

5590
03:54:43,160 --> 03:54:43,280
Bye-bye.

5591
03:54:44,500 --> 03:54:44,980
Oh!

5592
03:54:47,120 --> 03:54:49,280
Oh my god, he just stabbed me like that.

5593
03:54:51,400 --> 03:54:52,360
Jesus Christ!

5594
03:54:52,600 --> 03:54:53,980
There's so many of them!

5595
03:54:55,180 --> 03:54:56,020
Oh my...

5596
03:54:56,020 --> 03:54:57,580
Thank god I didn't try to fight these guys.

5597
03:54:57,820 --> 03:54:58,740
There were way too many.

5598
03:55:01,940 --> 03:55:03,240
Nice, we needed that.

5599
03:55:05,200 --> 03:55:05,880
Oh wait!

5600
03:55:06,060 --> 03:55:07,080
There was something up here.

5601
03:55:15,080 --> 03:55:16,220
Okay, we got a horn.

5602
03:55:17,400 --> 03:55:17,700
Whoops!

5603
03:55:18,400 --> 03:55:19,220
Did not mean to fall.

5604
03:55:19,740 --> 03:55:20,060
Oh hey!

5605
03:55:20,180 --> 03:55:20,500
Nice!

5606
03:55:20,740 --> 03:55:21,140
Actually.

5607
03:55:21,400 --> 03:55:22,200
I did mean to fall.

5608
03:55:25,340 --> 03:55:27,460
Okay, thank god they're like super slow too.

5609
03:55:28,800 --> 03:55:29,080
Whoop!

5610
03:55:30,600 --> 03:55:30,960
Alright.

5611
03:55:31,440 --> 03:55:32,700
And then we grab this one.

5612
03:55:33,120 --> 03:55:33,380
Ooh!

5613
03:55:33,540 --> 03:55:33,920
Rainbow!

5614
03:55:34,880 --> 03:55:35,940
I like that.

5615
03:55:38,380 --> 03:55:39,720
Alright, is there any more items here?

5616
03:55:40,820 --> 03:55:42,000
They're like parkour.

5617
03:55:42,460 --> 03:55:44,140
Yeah, I was gonna say the parkour items.

5618
03:55:45,260 --> 03:55:46,940
Okay, but how do I parkour this?

5619
03:55:50,840 --> 03:55:52,660
I assume it's like here.

5620
03:55:53,980 --> 03:55:54,260
No!

5621
03:55:54,420 --> 03:55:54,700
No!

5622
03:55:54,920 --> 03:55:55,120
No!

5623
03:55:55,400 --> 03:55:55,520
No!

5624
03:55:56,920 --> 03:55:59,520
Oh, I wish you could like steady your horse.

5625
03:56:00,520 --> 03:56:02,060
You know what I'm talking about?

5626
03:56:03,160 --> 03:56:03,720
Like...

5627
03:56:04,680 --> 03:56:06,320
Oh, this is so hard to control.

5628
03:56:07,400 --> 03:56:08,400
Oh, man!

5629
03:56:09,900 --> 03:56:12,200
This is actually so hard to control, guys.

5630
03:56:16,520 --> 03:56:18,100
Oh, if you like spell...

5631
03:56:18,100 --> 03:56:18,520
Oh, okay.

5632
03:56:18,740 --> 03:56:19,220
I don't.

5633
03:56:19,340 --> 03:56:19,800
Never mind.

5634
03:56:20,060 --> 03:56:21,060
It's not worth it.

5635
03:56:22,240 --> 03:56:23,560
It's for the nerds.

5636
03:56:23,760 --> 03:56:24,740
I ain't no nerd.

5637
03:56:30,290 --> 03:56:31,890
We don't need that.

5638
03:56:32,190 --> 03:56:32,870
We don't need that.

5639
03:56:37,250 --> 03:56:38,690
It's okay, guys.

5640
03:56:39,250 --> 03:56:40,490
I ain't no nerd.

5641
03:56:41,350 --> 03:56:42,390
Filthy magic.

5642
03:56:42,910 --> 03:56:43,390
Hahaha.

5643
03:56:46,950 --> 03:56:47,750
Seek item?

5644
03:56:52,760 --> 03:56:54,980
You guys were like being like, Oh, just get out.

5645
03:56:55,160 --> 03:56:56,180
Just don't use torrent.

5646
03:56:56,320 --> 03:56:57,740
And I was like, who the fuck is torrent?

5647
03:56:57,740 --> 03:56:59,360
I forgot that's his name.

5648
03:56:59,700 --> 03:57:00,180
Hahaha.

5649
03:57:01,220 --> 03:57:04,580
You see, I made sure to make him name this so I...

5650
03:57:04,580 --> 03:57:05,000
Hahaha.

5651
03:57:05,600 --> 03:57:07,780
So I can dehumanize him even more.

5652
03:57:09,580 --> 03:57:10,540
I forgot.

5653
03:57:10,540 --> 03:57:12,340
That you know him bad.

5654
03:57:12,500 --> 03:57:14,560
Therefore praise this message.

5655
03:57:15,960 --> 03:57:16,320
Horse?

5656
03:57:16,780 --> 03:57:17,580
What about horse?

5657
03:57:20,740 --> 03:57:22,100
I just call him horse.

5658
03:57:22,400 --> 03:57:23,480
That's my name for him.

5659
03:57:25,840 --> 03:57:26,920
He's just horse.

5660
03:57:27,500 --> 03:57:28,940
I think that's a great name.

5661
03:57:29,540 --> 03:57:30,100
Honestly.

5662
03:57:30,640 --> 03:57:32,600
It's like when people name their...

5663
03:57:32,600 --> 03:57:34,480
Name their dog, dog.

5664
03:57:34,940 --> 03:57:36,300
But then like, I get the name.

5665
03:57:36,640 --> 03:57:38,240
By name my goat, horse.

5666
03:57:45,630 --> 03:57:46,870
You wear a crab?

5667
03:57:46,990 --> 03:57:47,870
What's wrong with this crab?

5668
03:57:48,050 --> 03:57:48,750
Oh, this crab?

5669
03:57:49,370 --> 03:57:50,570
Okay, let me...

5670
03:57:50,570 --> 03:57:50,930
Oh!

5671
03:57:58,720 --> 03:58:01,520
I didn't even notice I had my fist up.

5672
03:58:03,340 --> 03:58:04,160
Buzz land.

5673
03:58:04,840 --> 03:58:06,300
Oh my god.

5674
03:58:06,560 --> 03:58:07,840
Oh, I'm leaving.

5675
03:58:08,040 --> 03:58:08,560
I'm leaving.

5676
03:58:08,760 --> 03:58:09,340
I'm leaving.

5677
03:58:09,500 --> 03:58:10,720
No, he couldn't have that.

5678
03:58:10,980 --> 03:58:11,540
Goodbye.

5679
03:58:12,660 --> 03:58:13,200
Goodbye.

5680
03:58:15,260 --> 03:58:16,040
That's alright.

5681
03:58:16,280 --> 03:58:16,400
Wait.

5682
03:58:17,300 --> 03:58:17,860
Unless...

5683
03:58:17,860 --> 03:58:18,580
Ha ha ha.

5684
03:58:22,280 --> 03:58:22,720
Okay.

5685
03:58:22,860 --> 03:58:23,700
He has the last laugh.

5686
03:58:24,240 --> 03:58:25,900
He has the last laugh.

5687
03:58:26,220 --> 03:58:26,800
Never mind.

5688
03:58:28,400 --> 03:58:29,200
One more hit.

5689
03:58:29,540 --> 03:58:30,000
There we go.

5690
03:58:30,320 --> 03:58:31,280
How much do I get out of that?

5691
03:58:31,620 --> 03:58:32,640
Was it even worth it?

5692
03:58:33,500 --> 03:58:34,440
Oh my god.

5693
03:58:34,440 --> 03:58:35,620
It was so worth it.

5694
03:58:35,740 --> 03:58:37,860
He gave me 2,000 and I stole his children.

5695
03:58:40,660 --> 03:58:42,060
Praise the giant sword.

5696
03:58:44,700 --> 03:58:47,180
Crabs don't care about high ground.

5697
03:58:51,200 --> 03:58:52,320
Crabs don't care about high ground.

5698
03:58:52,320 --> 03:58:52,920
Oh, okay.

5699
03:58:53,020 --> 03:58:53,480
That's pretty.

5700
03:58:53,980 --> 03:58:54,600
I will admit.

5701
03:58:54,800 --> 03:58:55,700
That is really pretty.

5702
03:58:58,940 --> 03:58:59,360
Yeah.

5703
03:59:04,820 --> 03:59:05,760
Anything here?

5704
03:59:06,120 --> 03:59:07,300
Oh, there's some grace.

5705
03:59:07,720 --> 03:59:08,040
Nice.

5706
03:59:09,400 --> 03:59:09,900
Yay.

5707
03:59:18,870 --> 03:59:19,370
Oh.

5708
03:59:19,790 --> 03:59:21,360
Oh, look at all these beautiful deers.

5709
03:59:23,170 --> 03:59:24,030
Look at them.

5710
03:59:25,990 --> 03:59:28,770
And these beautiful deers for me to kill.

5711
03:59:29,470 --> 03:59:29,930
Ha ha ha.

5712
03:59:31,810 --> 03:59:32,310
Yeah, I think.

5713
03:59:32,450 --> 03:59:32,830
Kill crab.

5714
03:59:37,390 --> 03:59:37,830
Please.

5715
03:59:37,970 --> 03:59:38,250
Please.

5716
03:59:38,330 --> 03:59:38,390
Please.

5717
03:59:38,390 --> 03:59:38,690
I'm sorry.

5718
03:59:38,830 --> 03:59:39,570
Please have mercy.

5719
03:59:39,710 --> 03:59:39,830
Please.

5720
03:59:39,950 --> 03:59:40,590
I didn't mean it.

5721
03:59:40,730 --> 03:59:41,530
I wasn't.

5722
03:59:41,630 --> 03:59:41,910
I didn't.

5723
03:59:41,950 --> 03:59:42,550
When I say kill.

5724
03:59:42,730 --> 03:59:43,410
I mean like.

5725
03:59:43,870 --> 03:59:44,310
Kiss.

5726
03:59:44,950 --> 03:59:45,810
Ha ha ha.

5727
03:59:46,650 --> 03:59:47,090
Sorry.

5728
03:59:47,670 --> 03:59:48,770
I think that's just my first language.

5729
03:59:49,070 --> 03:59:50,010
I got confused.

5730
03:59:52,190 --> 03:59:53,970
I just wanted to kiss the crab.

5731
03:59:58,130 --> 03:59:58,570
Yay.

5732
03:59:59,490 --> 03:59:59,710
Okay.

5733
03:59:59,790 --> 04:00:00,410
We can kill them.

5734
04:00:01,070 --> 04:00:01,350
Ha ha.

5735
04:00:01,550 --> 04:00:01,870
JK.

5736
04:00:02,230 --> 04:00:04,470
I actually wanted to kill the crab.

5737
04:00:07,650 --> 04:00:08,730
Where do I go?

5738
04:00:09,650 --> 04:00:10,310
This air is.

5739
04:00:10,730 --> 04:00:12,350
This air is so big.

5740
04:00:13,270 --> 04:00:15,550
Like, there's no actual map arena here.

5741
04:00:16,010 --> 04:00:16,190
Wait.

5742
04:00:16,190 --> 04:00:16,870
That's a ghost.

5743
04:00:17,290 --> 04:00:18,650
How do I kill a ghost?

5744
04:00:20,450 --> 04:00:21,030
Wait.

5745
04:00:21,170 --> 04:00:22,030
Those are ghosts.

5746
04:00:22,890 --> 04:00:23,850
You could kill a ghost?

5747
04:00:28,800 --> 04:00:30,300
Is he an evil ghost?

5748
04:00:30,920 --> 04:00:32,040
Oh my god.

5749
04:00:32,740 --> 04:00:33,180
Ha ha.

5750
04:00:33,660 --> 04:00:34,000
Guys.

5751
04:00:34,140 --> 04:00:36,160
I think that's an evil ghost, guys.

5752
04:00:40,190 --> 04:00:40,710
Wait.

5753
04:00:40,850 --> 04:00:40,870
Wait.

5754
04:00:40,890 --> 04:00:41,710
But I'm normal type.

5755
04:00:43,550 --> 04:00:44,190
Oh wait.

5756
04:00:44,330 --> 04:00:44,850
But he's a weak.

5757
04:00:45,010 --> 04:00:45,450
Never mind.

5758
04:00:45,590 --> 04:00:46,890
Apparently he's weak against normal.

5759
04:00:47,310 --> 04:00:48,650
That stupid ghost.

5760
04:00:50,770 --> 04:00:51,290
Okay.

5761
04:00:51,290 --> 04:00:51,790
Nice.

5762
04:00:55,520 --> 04:00:57,000
I guess I'll go up.

5763
04:01:04,100 --> 04:01:04,620
Nice.

5764
04:01:04,880 --> 04:01:05,340
Oh nice.

5765
04:01:05,420 --> 04:01:06,300
That does so much too.

5766
04:01:06,300 --> 04:01:06,940
That's good.

5767
04:01:07,680 --> 04:01:08,300
That's good.

5768
04:01:08,360 --> 04:01:08,680
That's good to know.

5769
04:01:10,860 --> 04:01:11,380
Alright.

5770
04:01:12,380 --> 04:01:14,280
I'm too lazy to reinstall.

5771
04:01:14,480 --> 04:01:15,380
Log into praise.

5772
04:01:15,560 --> 04:01:17,020
But here's some support anyway.

5773
04:01:17,200 --> 04:01:18,320
I think it was a super chat.

5774
04:01:18,600 --> 04:01:19,020
Thank you.

5775
04:01:19,160 --> 04:01:19,560
Thank you.

5776
04:01:20,120 --> 04:01:21,040
I'll just go up.

5777
04:01:21,040 --> 04:01:21,060
What?

5778
04:01:24,100 --> 04:01:25,620
I'm not invading anything.

5779
04:01:25,860 --> 04:01:26,680
I'm just exploring.

5780
04:01:26,940 --> 04:01:27,960
I'm Christopher Columbus.

5781
04:01:30,280 --> 04:01:31,900
It's not like we were...

5782
04:01:31,900 --> 04:01:34,780
It's not like we removed his statue or anything.

5783
04:01:41,820 --> 04:01:42,720
What's this?

5784
04:01:43,020 --> 04:01:43,420
Oh!

5785
04:01:43,600 --> 04:01:43,960
Wow!

5786
04:01:44,300 --> 04:01:44,800
Oh nice.

5787
04:01:45,280 --> 04:01:46,560
That's a great...

5788
04:01:46,560 --> 04:01:47,280
I touched up.

5789
04:01:50,460 --> 04:01:50,980
Alright.

5790
04:01:51,220 --> 04:01:52,060
What does that do?

5791
04:01:54,480 --> 04:01:55,680
What did I even do?

5792
04:01:56,220 --> 04:01:57,640
Is that part of the mission?

5793
04:02:05,170 --> 04:02:07,790
Normal type is immune to ghost type.

5794
04:02:09,910 --> 04:02:11,830
I have to light them all up?

5795
04:02:12,070 --> 04:02:12,330
Oh.

5796
04:02:12,690 --> 04:02:12,930
Okay.

5797
04:02:13,610 --> 04:02:14,930
This is part of this quest.

5798
04:02:19,030 --> 04:02:19,850
Oh my god!

5799
04:02:19,970 --> 04:02:21,050
He fli- Oh my god!

5800
04:02:21,070 --> 04:02:21,610
He cheated!

5801
04:02:23,210 --> 04:02:23,970
Oh no!

5802
04:02:24,570 --> 04:02:24,870
Oh no!

5803
04:02:26,630 --> 04:02:27,210
Oh yeah.

5804
04:02:27,630 --> 04:02:28,030
That's fine.

5805
04:02:29,050 --> 04:02:29,830
Oh my god.

5806
04:02:29,970 --> 04:02:30,210
It's fine.

5807
04:02:30,390 --> 04:02:30,910
I got greedy.

5808
04:02:31,070 --> 04:02:31,590
But that's okay.

5809
04:02:31,930 --> 04:02:32,990
It was worth it.

5810
04:02:34,490 --> 04:02:35,750
It was so worth it.

5811
04:02:37,910 --> 04:02:39,230
You were- Oh thank you.

5812
04:02:39,410 --> 04:02:39,730
Thank you.

5813
04:02:39,890 --> 04:02:40,110
Thank you.

5814
04:02:40,230 --> 04:02:41,030
Oh man.

5815
04:02:41,110 --> 04:02:41,790
That was so helpful.

5816
04:02:42,850 --> 04:02:43,770
That great rune.

5817
04:02:44,030 --> 04:02:44,790
Jesus Christ.

5818
04:02:44,830 --> 04:02:46,050
I have to find eight of these?

5819
04:02:51,760 --> 04:02:52,560
What's he doing?

5820
04:02:52,700 --> 04:02:53,380
Protecting that.

5821
04:02:53,380 --> 04:02:53,940
Wait.

5822
04:02:54,060 --> 04:02:55,040
Can I backstab a ghost?

5823
04:02:58,040 --> 04:02:58,860
Backshot it.

5824
04:03:00,200 --> 04:03:01,320
Backshot it a ghost.

5825
04:03:01,500 --> 04:03:02,020
That's right.

5826
04:03:02,740 --> 04:03:04,940
You ain't finding peace in the afterlife.

5827
04:03:07,720 --> 04:03:09,400
What was he doing in the corner?

5828
04:03:09,620 --> 04:03:11,040
It wasn't even a surprise attack.

5829
04:03:11,400 --> 04:03:12,460
It was just there.

5830
04:03:23,950 --> 04:03:25,130
I'll grab this.

5831
04:03:27,210 --> 04:03:27,770
Okay.

5832
04:03:28,210 --> 04:03:29,610
Oh it's these guys again.

5833
04:03:30,990 --> 04:03:32,030
Is it even worth it?

5834
04:03:32,210 --> 04:03:32,970
No they're not.

5835
04:03:33,270 --> 04:03:33,910
It's plus 27.

5836
04:03:34,390 --> 04:03:35,490
Maybe the big guy?

5837
04:03:37,730 --> 04:03:39,190
Maybe the- Nah.

5838
04:03:39,610 --> 04:03:40,950
I don't think it's worth it actually.

5839
04:03:42,410 --> 04:03:43,010
Wait.

5840
04:03:43,130 --> 04:03:43,150
Wait.

5841
04:03:43,150 --> 04:03:44,330
What are these guys doing here?

5842
04:03:44,670 --> 04:03:46,090
Are these guys worth it?

5843
04:03:51,910 --> 04:03:53,810
I have no idea they're worth it.

5844
04:03:58,050 --> 04:03:58,650
Oh.

5845
04:03:58,830 --> 04:03:59,530
That's poison.

5846
04:04:00,750 --> 04:04:01,850
We're just chillin.

5847
04:04:02,310 --> 04:04:03,810
Fuck these flowers I guess.

5848
04:04:05,590 --> 04:04:07,770
It's like I'm the Mr. Beast villain.

5849
04:04:08,030 --> 04:04:10,930
Where he's trying to- Did you guys see that thing?

5850
04:04:11,110 --> 04:04:11,530
Where like.

5851
04:04:12,050 --> 04:04:14,790
He used to be all about planting trees.

5852
04:04:15,030 --> 04:04:15,530
And like.

5853
04:04:17,110 --> 04:04:18,210
And saving the ocean.

5854
04:04:18,530 --> 04:04:19,970
And now he ha- He like.

5855
04:04:20,450 --> 04:04:20,730
Uh.

5856
04:04:20,890 --> 04:04:23,870
Released an AI generated thumbnail website.

5857
04:04:25,530 --> 04:04:26,650
From planning.

5858
04:04:27,030 --> 04:04:27,550
You know it's like.

5859
04:04:27,830 --> 04:04:29,430
All those trees I planted.

5860
04:04:29,750 --> 04:04:30,610
Fuck that.

5861
04:04:30,970 --> 04:04:31,810
Oh shit.

5862
04:04:35,960 --> 04:04:37,020
Oh my god.

5863
04:04:37,480 --> 04:04:38,580
Can flowers bleed?

5864
04:04:38,940 --> 04:04:40,080
It's time to find out.

5865
04:04:42,600 --> 04:04:44,820
It's time to find out if these flowers.

5866
04:04:45,960 --> 04:04:47,340
I thought it was crazy.

5867
04:04:47,840 --> 04:04:48,620
Like he was like.

5868
04:04:49,620 --> 04:04:50,860
The fact that like.

5869
04:04:51,060 --> 04:04:51,640
Now he's like.

5870
04:04:52,360 --> 04:04:55,700
Promoting an AI generated YouTube thumbnail website.

5871
04:04:56,240 --> 04:04:57,020
And then he like.

5872
04:04:57,200 --> 04:04:57,820
Put on like.

5873
04:04:58,020 --> 04:04:58,780
He like.

5874
04:04:58,900 --> 04:04:59,320
Put like.

5875
04:04:59,700 --> 04:05:00,600
Jacksepticeye in there.

5876
04:05:00,800 --> 04:05:01,360
Even though he was.

5877
04:05:01,660 --> 04:05:02,640
Jacksepticeye has been like.

5878
04:05:02,800 --> 04:05:04,320
Super vocal about hating AI.

5879
04:05:05,180 --> 04:05:06,900
I think that one was crazy.

5880
04:05:07,660 --> 04:05:09,440
Like he put that in the promotion.

5881
04:05:13,020 --> 04:05:13,780
He's done.

5882
04:05:13,900 --> 04:05:14,500
I got him.

5883
04:05:18,520 --> 04:05:19,040
Wait.

5884
04:05:19,140 --> 04:05:19,560
That's it?

5885
04:05:19,940 --> 04:05:21,660
What was the point of killing him?

5886
04:05:26,580 --> 04:05:27,800
How do I get up there?

5887
04:05:28,260 --> 04:05:29,120
Is that parkour?

5888
04:05:29,900 --> 04:05:30,420
Parkour.

5889
04:05:41,270 --> 04:05:42,030
Okay.

5890
04:05:42,510 --> 04:05:43,210
Come on horse.

5891
04:05:43,370 --> 04:05:44,010
You got this.

5892
04:05:55,900 --> 04:05:56,920
Come on horse.

5893
04:05:57,720 --> 04:05:59,180
You got this.

5894
04:05:59,180 --> 04:05:59,340
You got this.

5895
04:06:02,810 --> 04:06:03,630
My god.

5896
04:06:04,310 --> 04:06:05,030
I've always believed.

5897
04:06:06,210 --> 04:06:07,390
I've always believed!

5898
04:06:10,730 --> 04:06:11,490
Alright.

5899
04:06:11,730 --> 04:06:12,050
Hello.

5900
04:06:12,050 --> 04:06:12,250
I know.

5901
04:06:12,450 --> 04:06:12,910
Oh.

5902
04:06:14,170 --> 04:06:14,890
A customer.

5903
04:06:15,170 --> 04:06:15,350
Yeah.

5904
04:06:18,230 --> 04:06:19,050
That's me.

5905
04:06:21,190 --> 04:06:21,750
Oh.

5906
04:06:22,970 --> 04:06:24,170
There's nothing really.

5907
04:06:24,670 --> 04:06:25,410
Never mind.

5908
04:06:25,530 --> 04:06:26,530
You don't have anything I want.

5909
04:06:27,630 --> 04:06:28,570
Never mind.

5910
04:06:29,190 --> 04:06:29,330
Wait.

5911
04:06:29,390 --> 04:06:29,790
That's it?

5912
04:06:32,010 --> 04:06:33,350
What the fuck was the point?

5913
04:06:36,750 --> 04:06:37,230
Guys.

5914
04:06:37,410 --> 04:06:38,230
I don't need to get soap.

5915
04:06:38,430 --> 04:06:39,330
I'm not at a convention.

5916
04:06:41,830 --> 04:06:42,790
Oh really?

5917
04:06:43,050 --> 04:06:43,210
Wait.

5918
04:06:43,370 --> 04:06:43,510
Okay.

5919
04:06:45,470 --> 04:06:45,950
Okay.

5920
04:06:46,070 --> 04:06:47,070
What's the cookbook for?

5921
04:06:53,100 --> 04:06:55,200
Do I really need this though?

5922
04:06:56,640 --> 04:06:57,180
Eh.

5923
04:06:57,840 --> 04:06:59,140
I barely craft.

5924
04:06:59,500 --> 04:07:00,120
That's the thing.

5925
04:07:00,380 --> 04:07:00,500
Okay.

5926
04:07:00,540 --> 04:07:01,260
I'll buy one.

5927
04:07:02,080 --> 04:07:03,140
I'll buy one.

5928
04:07:04,160 --> 04:07:05,540
Can I go anywhere else?

5929
04:07:05,680 --> 04:07:06,160
Is that it?

5930
04:07:23,450 --> 04:07:23,990
Eh.

5931
04:07:26,140 --> 04:07:27,570
I guess there's nothing else here.

5932
04:07:28,330 --> 04:07:29,580
We don't need the keys.

5933
04:07:30,210 --> 04:07:30,630
Do we?

5934
04:07:33,090 --> 04:07:33,630
Yeah.

5935
04:07:33,630 --> 04:07:34,950
I don't think we need the keys.

5936
04:07:35,670 --> 04:07:37,810
I'm never gonna change my stats.

5937
04:07:40,710 --> 04:07:42,030
Do we need the keys?

5938
04:07:42,290 --> 04:07:43,290
What are we gonna get to them for?

5939
04:07:46,210 --> 04:07:46,710
Uh.

5940
04:07:47,190 --> 04:07:47,810
I'll get...

5941
04:07:47,810 --> 04:07:48,130
Eh.

5942
04:07:48,150 --> 04:07:48,810
I'll buy one.

5943
04:07:50,370 --> 04:07:50,870
Alright.

5944
04:07:51,190 --> 04:07:52,050
That's all I'll buy.

5945
04:07:55,110 --> 04:07:55,610
Alright.

5946
04:07:55,690 --> 04:07:55,970
Goodbye.

5947
04:07:57,690 --> 04:07:58,190
Goodbye.

5948
04:08:06,110 --> 04:08:06,790
Oh man.

5949
04:08:06,890 --> 04:08:07,970
I spent so much money there.

5950
04:08:08,270 --> 04:08:09,290
Better be worth it.

5951
04:08:14,140 --> 04:08:14,640
What?

5952
04:08:15,000 --> 04:08:16,760
I don't really like fighting these guys.

5953
04:08:17,000 --> 04:08:17,580
There's too...

5954
04:08:17,580 --> 04:08:18,740
They're not worth it.

5955
04:08:18,880 --> 04:08:20,140
These big boys.

5956
04:08:20,800 --> 04:08:21,540
I don't know.

5957
04:08:21,620 --> 04:08:23,220
These big boys aren't worth it in my opinion.

5958
04:08:23,620 --> 04:08:25,680
Cause the babies barely give anything to.

5959
04:08:27,300 --> 04:08:28,720
I'm not buying soap!

5960
04:08:31,440 --> 04:08:33,720
I'll use what mother nature gave me.

5961
04:08:39,300 --> 04:08:40,900
Soap is a devil's worth.

5962
04:08:50,130 --> 04:08:50,710
Oh wait.

5963
04:08:50,790 --> 04:08:51,290
There's another crab.

5964
04:08:51,390 --> 04:08:51,530
Wait.

5965
04:08:51,730 --> 04:08:52,130
Crab's good.

5966
04:08:52,670 --> 04:08:53,990
Crab gives me so much.

5967
04:08:57,370 --> 04:08:57,970
Fuck.

5968
04:08:58,730 --> 04:08:59,170
Every time.

5969
04:09:00,450 --> 04:09:01,750
I never learn.

5970
04:09:02,030 --> 04:09:03,210
I never learn.

5971
04:09:03,710 --> 04:09:04,810
I never learn.

5972
04:09:11,640 --> 04:09:12,360
It's fine.

5973
04:09:12,480 --> 04:09:13,060
I can tank this.

5974
04:09:14,000 --> 04:09:14,600
Here you go.

5975
04:09:19,970 --> 04:09:21,870
If cats can self-groom, I can.

5976
04:09:24,730 --> 04:09:25,450
So cute.

5977
04:09:25,830 --> 04:09:25,950
Thank you.

5978
04:09:26,270 --> 04:09:26,550
Thank you.

5979
04:09:26,730 --> 04:09:27,170
Oh shit!

5980
04:09:28,130 --> 04:09:28,490
Ghosts!

5981
04:09:30,090 --> 04:09:31,450
I'm afraid of no ghosts.

5982
04:09:35,360 --> 04:09:35,960
Oh my god.

5983
04:09:36,060 --> 04:09:36,100
Wait.

5984
04:09:36,200 --> 04:09:37,740
This guy is stronger than the other ghosts.

5985
04:09:38,320 --> 04:09:38,920
What the fuck?

5986
04:09:41,500 --> 04:09:42,120
There we go.

5987
04:09:45,930 --> 04:09:46,410
Alright.

5988
04:09:46,910 --> 04:09:48,330
Now I can light this up.

5989
04:09:49,450 --> 04:09:51,110
I'll kill these deers for fun too.

5990
04:09:55,990 --> 04:09:56,490
Oh wait.

5991
04:09:58,330 --> 04:09:58,810
Joink.

5992
04:10:00,750 --> 04:10:01,830
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

5993
04:10:03,530 --> 04:10:04,570
Okay, now...

5994
04:10:04,570 --> 04:10:04,670
Oh!

5995
04:10:05,070 --> 04:10:05,990
Nice, he almost grabbed me.

5996
04:10:06,570 --> 04:10:07,170
That's close.

5997
04:10:08,430 --> 04:10:09,510
Oh god, that was close.

5998
04:10:11,650 --> 04:10:12,890
Oh, I don't have any...

5999
04:10:12,890 --> 04:10:13,650
I don't have magic anymore!

6000
04:10:13,650 --> 04:10:13,690
No more!

6001
04:10:16,370 --> 04:10:17,490
Alright, that's fine.

6002
04:10:17,650 --> 04:10:18,070
I'm okay.

6003
04:10:18,730 --> 04:10:19,470
I'm okay.

6004
04:10:20,810 --> 04:10:21,610
Everything's fine.

6005
04:10:24,410 --> 04:10:24,970
Uh...

6006
04:10:24,970 --> 04:10:26,170
That's eight, right?

6007
04:10:27,470 --> 04:10:28,650
There's eight of these.

6008
04:10:29,630 --> 04:10:30,930
God, I have to find so many.

6009
04:10:32,510 --> 04:10:33,270
Get out.

6010
04:10:38,700 --> 04:10:40,180
Oh, there's so many ghosts.

6011
04:10:41,740 --> 04:10:42,980
There's a grace nearby?

6012
04:10:43,940 --> 04:10:45,520
Alright, let's find that grace first.

6013
04:10:51,700 --> 04:10:53,480
I don't want to find that grace.

6014
04:10:53,840 --> 04:10:54,740
Or anything.

6015
04:11:00,730 --> 04:11:01,550
Where is...

6016
04:11:01,550 --> 04:11:02,230
Oh, there it is.

6017
04:11:02,830 --> 04:11:03,190
Nice.

6018
04:11:13,680 --> 04:11:14,920
Did I...

6019
04:11:14,920 --> 04:11:16,140
Okay, I refilled everything.

6020
04:11:19,220 --> 04:11:21,220
Alright, time to find more.

6021
04:11:21,960 --> 04:11:24,340
Oh, I'm only two out of eight.

6022
04:11:24,860 --> 04:11:26,760
How is there eight of these?

6023
04:11:28,400 --> 04:11:30,800
After I get all eight, do I just like unlock...

6024
04:11:31,800 --> 04:11:33,060
Uh, unlock the boss?

6025
04:11:36,890 --> 04:11:38,610
Will I ever...

6026
04:11:42,000 --> 04:11:43,180
Jesus Christ.

6027
04:11:46,380 --> 04:11:49,100
I haven't done a single story boss.

6028
04:11:49,100 --> 04:11:49,220
What?

6029
04:11:52,640 --> 04:11:54,400
I've been stuck in the...

6030
04:11:54,400 --> 04:11:57,980
I don't know how I haven't fucking found a single story boss.

6031
04:12:00,520 --> 04:12:02,100
I know this is not...

6032
04:12:02,100 --> 04:12:04,440
This does not look like a story boss area too.

6033
04:12:05,000 --> 04:12:05,720
That's the thing.

6034
04:12:05,860 --> 04:12:07,780
I can tell this isn't a story boss area.

6035
04:12:07,780 --> 04:12:07,920
I can't.

6036
04:12:10,940 --> 04:12:12,560
We're gonna be here forever.

6037
04:12:13,060 --> 04:12:14,580
We're gonna be here forever.

6038
04:12:16,460 --> 04:12:19,740
I could have done two entire story bosses.

6039
04:12:24,620 --> 04:12:27,860
Do you think I'm, like, two under level for the story boss, though?

6040
04:12:28,520 --> 04:12:29,560
For the next one?

6041
04:12:31,020 --> 04:12:31,580
Oh, yeah.

6042
04:12:32,100 --> 04:12:33,100
They look like nice rats.

6043
04:12:36,500 --> 04:12:37,580
They were not nice rats.

6044
04:12:37,700 --> 04:12:38,340
They were not nice rats.

6045
04:12:38,500 --> 04:12:39,900
They were not nice rats.

6046
04:12:40,120 --> 04:12:40,820
They were...

6047
04:12:41,700 --> 04:12:42,100
Felt

6048
04:12:46,830 --> 04:12:47,890
like they'd be nice to me.

6049
04:12:48,290 --> 04:12:49,230
You know?!

6050
04:12:49,230 --> 04:12:50,710
Like, I'm like the exception?

6051
04:12:52,090 --> 04:12:54,610
Like, I don't know, maybe I'd be, like...

6052
04:12:54,610 --> 04:12:56,070
Remy from Ratatouille?

6053
04:12:56,310 --> 04:12:57,690
Oh my god.

6054
04:12:59,050 --> 04:13:00,370
Oh, I didn't die.

6055
04:13:00,690 --> 04:13:02,050
Oh, it's a miracle.

6056
04:13:02,250 --> 04:13:04,510
It actually is a miracle I didn't die.

6057
04:13:08,290 --> 04:13:11,030
Okay, well, it gave me to another shrine.

6058
04:13:11,170 --> 04:13:11,670
You know what?

6059
04:13:11,850 --> 04:13:12,630
That works out.

6060
04:13:13,290 --> 04:13:15,370
Oh my god, there's so many rats.

6061
04:13:18,130 --> 04:13:20,270
At least we found another shrine.

6062
04:13:22,910 --> 04:13:23,910
Calculated, guys.

6063
04:13:24,310 --> 04:13:25,270
Very calculated.

6064
04:13:29,620 --> 04:13:30,620
He doesn't know.

6065
04:13:31,840 --> 04:13:32,900
He doesn't know.

6066
04:13:33,700 --> 04:13:35,400
He's too busy, Lexi.

6067
04:13:35,800 --> 04:13:37,580
Doing the morning exercises, you know?

6068
04:13:39,840 --> 04:13:41,520
It's the morning exercise.

6069
04:13:42,960 --> 04:13:44,080
Oh my god.

6070
04:13:44,220 --> 04:13:45,160
Oh my god.

6071
04:13:48,870 --> 04:13:49,550
Okay.

6072
04:13:50,590 --> 04:13:51,810
Oh my god.

6073
04:13:51,970 --> 04:13:52,490
What?

6074
04:13:53,570 --> 04:13:53,970
Oh!

6075
04:13:55,150 --> 04:13:56,790
He doesn't stop swinging!

6076
04:13:58,190 --> 04:13:58,910
Jesus Christ.

6077
04:14:05,220 --> 04:14:06,340
Oh, he doesn't stop.

6078
04:14:06,460 --> 04:14:07,060
He doesn't stop.

6079
04:14:07,180 --> 04:14:08,000
He doesn't stop!

6080
04:14:12,070 --> 04:14:12,970
I can take this.

6081
04:14:13,330 --> 04:14:14,550
Oh, I can take it.

6082
04:14:15,550 --> 04:14:17,070
Okay, thank you for the super chat.

6083
04:14:17,190 --> 04:14:17,850
Thank you, thank you.

6084
04:14:17,850 --> 04:14:20,050
Yeah, look where I'm seeing you guys tomorrow on the panel.

6085
04:14:20,530 --> 04:14:22,730
Oh, I forgot to wake up early tomorrow, too.

6086
04:14:26,430 --> 04:14:31,230
Because, like, it's the only time for me to go through the Artist Alley.

6087
04:14:31,430 --> 04:14:34,970
So, I have to wake up at, like, so early to do it before my panel.

6088
04:14:36,090 --> 04:14:38,070
Thank god I'm taking three days off after.

6089
04:14:39,670 --> 04:14:40,110
Okay.

6090
04:14:40,110 --> 04:14:41,230
Where's the other thing I found?

6091
04:14:41,430 --> 04:14:41,790
Oh, it's right here.

6092
04:14:47,060 --> 04:14:49,180
Okay, they're doing their morning exercises again.

6093
04:14:49,400 --> 04:14:52,880
Oh, the one child decided to not follow his mom.

6094
04:14:53,840 --> 04:14:55,240
Oh, no, he saw.

6095
04:14:56,600 --> 04:14:57,860
He saw me kill.

6096
04:15:01,100 --> 04:15:01,660
Jesus.

6097
04:15:07,700 --> 04:15:08,260
Okay.

6098
04:15:10,820 --> 04:15:11,380
Okay.

6099
04:15:13,100 --> 04:15:15,540
Alright, I'm playing a lot more careful right now.

6100
04:15:19,230 --> 04:15:19,790
Alright.

6101
04:15:24,160 --> 04:15:25,020
I think he backstab.

6102
04:15:25,400 --> 04:15:25,900
Yes!

6103
04:15:27,400 --> 04:15:28,880
It's too late for him!

6104
04:15:29,480 --> 04:15:31,380
Too late, I apologize.

6105
04:15:32,900 --> 04:15:34,140
It's too late!

6106
04:15:35,340 --> 04:15:36,660
Light that candle!

6107
04:15:37,640 --> 04:15:38,120
Yippee!

6108
04:15:39,240 --> 04:15:41,360
I don't even know how many I've got.

6109
04:15:42,340 --> 04:15:43,080
That's right.

6110
04:15:43,200 --> 04:15:44,140
Backshot the ghost.

6111
04:15:44,540 --> 04:15:45,860
What you gonna do now?

6112
04:15:46,360 --> 04:15:47,380
Oh, that's for flask.

6113
04:15:47,420 --> 04:15:48,120
I shouldn't need that.

6114
04:15:49,660 --> 04:15:52,520
There's apparently a hundred boost selling Doki merch.

6115
04:15:52,680 --> 04:15:54,680
So I might not be able to get to a hundred.

6116
04:15:55,080 --> 04:15:59,080
But like, uh, I'll try to get as many as I could before I get like too tired.

6117
04:16:03,790 --> 04:16:06,130
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

6118
04:16:08,470 --> 04:16:11,450
Yeah, there's a lot of boost selling Doki merch.

6119
04:16:12,110 --> 04:16:14,490
But, uh, oh wait, is that...

6120
04:16:15,850 --> 04:16:16,350
Eh.

6121
04:16:18,570 --> 04:16:19,830
But then...

6122
04:16:19,830 --> 04:16:21,630
If I'm getting, if I'm too tired...

6123
04:16:21,630 --> 04:16:22,690
Oh my god!

6124
04:16:22,970 --> 04:16:24,050
Oh, they know magic too!

6125
04:16:24,570 --> 04:16:25,610
Ghost magic!

6126
04:16:26,210 --> 04:16:27,190
Holy shit!

6127
04:16:27,990 --> 04:16:28,630
What?!

6128
04:16:32,290 --> 04:16:35,030
Are they like, are they auto-aiming?

6129
04:16:35,910 --> 04:16:36,950
Oh my god!

6130
04:16:37,450 --> 04:16:38,850
Is this auto-aiming?!

6131
04:16:38,850 --> 04:16:39,890
This has to be auto-aiming!

6132
04:16:40,010 --> 04:16:40,650
There's no way!

6133
04:16:41,190 --> 04:16:41,950
There's no way!

6134
04:16:43,150 --> 04:16:44,030
Ghost magic!

6135
04:16:53,040 --> 04:16:54,120
Oh my god!

6136
04:16:54,360 --> 04:16:55,760
This is what the shrine does!

6137
04:17:00,530 --> 04:17:01,350
Oh my god!

6138
04:17:02,610 --> 04:17:03,130
This...

6139
04:17:05,210 --> 04:17:06,450
Wait, use a key?

6140
04:17:06,730 --> 04:17:07,570
How do I use it?

6141
04:17:13,690 --> 04:17:14,210
Oh!

6142
04:17:14,690 --> 04:17:15,430
Did I just use...

6143
04:17:15,430 --> 04:17:16,070
Go to my inventory?

6144
04:17:18,450 --> 04:17:20,250
On the gargoyles?

6145
04:17:22,050 --> 04:17:23,030
Oh!

6146
04:17:27,280 --> 04:17:28,260
Oh!

6147
04:17:30,470 --> 04:17:30,960
What?

6148
04:17:32,470 --> 04:17:33,500
Oh, I see!

6149
04:17:34,000 --> 04:17:34,920
What does this do?

6150
04:17:40,440 --> 04:17:42,220
Oh, up I go!

6151
04:17:43,680 --> 04:17:45,680
Up and up I go!

6152
04:18:01,020 --> 04:18:02,000
Hello?

6153
04:18:05,000 --> 04:18:05,490
Oh...

6154
04:18:16,520 --> 04:18:17,010
Oh...

6155
04:18:20,920 --> 04:18:23,140
I want to go home!

6156
04:18:23,620 --> 04:18:29,500
I want to go home!

6157
04:18:29,500 --> 04:18:31,680
That's the first message I saw!

6158
04:18:32,280 --> 04:18:34,160
I want to go home!

6159
04:18:37,660 --> 04:18:40,280
Why would the key take me here?

6160
04:18:40,560 --> 04:18:42,580
Why would it take me here?

6161
04:18:43,620 --> 04:18:45,200
Let's go to...

6162
04:18:45,200 --> 04:18:45,580
Let's go to...

6163
04:18:46,360 --> 04:18:46,980
Oh...

6164
04:18:46,980 --> 04:18:47,560
Oh...

6165
04:18:48,480 --> 04:18:48,790
No...

6166
04:18:49,100 --> 04:18:49,980
Where am I?

6167
04:18:53,760 --> 04:18:54,840
Do I go?

6168
04:18:56,180 --> 04:18:57,920
I don't know where to go!

6169
04:19:01,760 --> 04:19:02,380
Oh...

6170
04:19:02,380 --> 04:19:05,200
Wait, aren't those bears like, really scary?

6171
04:19:06,280 --> 04:19:09,760
Like, stronger than any of the other fucking area... things?

6172
04:19:09,760 --> 04:19:11,160
Oh my god, I'm fucking leaving.

6173
04:19:11,440 --> 04:19:12,720
I'm fucking...

6174
04:19:12,720 --> 04:19:14,040
Oh my god!

6175
04:19:15,660 --> 04:19:16,000
AHHHHHH!

6176
04:19:18,900 --> 04:19:19,580
AHHHHHH!

6177
04:19:19,700 --> 04:19:20,020
AHHHHHH!

6178
04:19:22,260 --> 04:19:22,940
AHHHHH!

6179
04:19:23,460 --> 04:19:24,740
He did fire!

6180
04:19:27,780 --> 04:19:28,980
Oh my god!

6181
04:19:29,220 --> 04:19:30,000
Oh fuck god!

6182
04:19:30,120 --> 04:19:30,880
Get me outta here!

6183
04:19:31,180 --> 04:19:32,760
Get me outta here!

6184
04:19:33,240 --> 04:19:34,380
Where am I?

6185
04:19:34,760 --> 04:19:35,420
Where am I?

6186
04:19:35,940 --> 04:19:36,960
Holy shit!

6187
04:19:39,720 --> 04:19:40,600
What's this?

6188
04:19:41,360 --> 04:19:41,740
What's this?

6189
04:19:41,740 --> 04:19:42,980
Oh, that's a big ass beta!

6190
04:19:43,400 --> 04:19:44,600
I'm gonna go kill it!

6191
04:19:47,780 --> 04:19:49,200
I don't know how I survived!

6192
04:19:50,040 --> 04:19:51,400
I'm so sad!

6193
04:19:52,040 --> 04:19:54,340
I don't know how I survived though!

6194
04:19:54,560 --> 04:19:55,880
But I'm here now!

6195
04:19:56,520 --> 04:19:57,080
I'm...

6196
04:19:57,760 --> 04:19:58,040
Oh...

6197
04:19:58,040 --> 04:19:59,520
That's a swamp!

6198
04:19:59,800 --> 04:20:01,040
Alright, how much does it do?

6199
04:20:02,220 --> 04:20:03,020
Oh...

6200
04:20:03,020 --> 04:20:03,500
Oh...

6201
04:20:03,500 --> 04:20:04,200
No...

6202
04:20:04,200 --> 04:20:04,700
No...

6203
04:20:04,700 --> 04:20:05,820
Not the poison!

6204
04:20:06,800 --> 04:20:07,200
Alright...

6205
04:20:07,600 --> 04:20:07,940
I...

6206
04:20:07,940 --> 04:20:08,360
Okay...

6207
04:20:09,040 --> 04:20:09,700
Goodbye...

6208
04:20:11,100 --> 04:20:12,560
Take me back!

6209
04:20:12,960 --> 04:20:14,240
Take me back!

6210
04:20:14,920 --> 04:20:15,600
Take me back!

6211
04:20:15,760 --> 04:20:15,820
Take...

6212
04:20:15,820 --> 04:20:16,400
Yeah...

6213
04:20:16,400 --> 04:20:16,800
Um...

6214
04:20:16,800 --> 04:20:17,500
I'm leaving!

6215
04:20:23,330 --> 04:20:24,130
Alright...

6216
04:20:24,130 --> 04:20:25,570
We'll go right side!

6217
04:20:28,590 --> 04:20:31,570
Surely right side is not as bad, right?

6218
04:20:32,530 --> 04:20:34,370
Okay, these guys look like scouters.

6219
04:20:35,330 --> 04:20:38,130
But they don't seem like they're evil though.

6220
04:20:43,920 --> 04:20:44,560
Eh...

6221
04:20:46,340 --> 04:20:47,480
What do they kill?

6222
04:20:50,040 --> 04:20:51,320
OH SHIT!

6223
04:20:51,480 --> 04:20:52,020
Themselves!

6224
04:20:54,140 --> 04:20:55,460
Okay, now I know.

6225
04:20:56,600 --> 04:20:57,560
Sniper ahead?

6226
04:20:58,320 --> 04:20:59,560
Oh, there he is.

6227
04:21:04,920 --> 04:21:06,500
Okay, I can outrun this.

6228
04:21:11,400 --> 04:21:12,040
Alright...

6229
04:21:12,040 --> 04:21:12,680
Alright...

6230
04:21:14,180 --> 04:21:14,820
Um...

6231
04:21:15,660 --> 04:21:16,300
Um...

6232
04:21:16,300 --> 04:21:17,440
Oh my...

6233
04:21:17,440 --> 04:21:19,400
Okay, that was absolute cinema though.

6234
04:21:19,840 --> 04:21:20,740
That was...

6235
04:21:20,740 --> 04:21:23,020
Yeah man, that was pretty fucking cool.

6236
04:21:23,260 --> 04:21:24,940
I don't know if I can do that again though.

6237
04:21:25,260 --> 04:21:26,000
I can.

6238
04:21:30,200 --> 04:21:31,260
Absolute cinema!

6239
04:21:32,380 --> 04:21:33,340
Watch this.

6240
04:21:36,860 --> 04:21:37,600
Please jump.

6241
04:21:38,000 --> 04:21:38,820
Please jump.

6242
04:21:38,960 --> 04:21:39,060
Please jump.

6243
04:21:39,060 --> 04:21:39,120
Okay.

6244
04:21:42,920 --> 04:21:43,400
Wait...

6245
04:21:43,400 --> 04:21:44,200
That guy doesn't...

6246
04:21:44,200 --> 04:21:45,660
I don't know if that guy's friend shape.

6247
04:21:47,040 --> 04:21:47,920
Oh shit!

6248
04:21:48,900 --> 04:21:50,180
That's not what I wanted to do.

6249
04:21:52,740 --> 04:21:53,220
Oh!

6250
04:21:53,400 --> 04:21:54,980
Oh my god!

6251
04:21:55,060 --> 04:21:56,140
Okay, that was cool.

6252
04:21:56,440 --> 04:21:57,680
That was really...

6253
04:21:57,680 --> 04:21:58,340
You gotta admit.

6254
04:21:58,580 --> 04:22:00,200
That was pretty cool what I just did.

6255
04:22:05,970 --> 04:22:07,070
I opened.

6256
04:22:09,470 --> 04:22:10,890
Oh my god!

6257
04:22:11,070 --> 04:22:12,070
I was gaming!

6258
04:22:14,110 --> 04:22:14,790
Calculated!

6259
04:22:15,990 --> 04:22:17,390
Did I talk to him yet?

6260
04:22:17,710 --> 04:22:19,890
Or is he too mad about the guy?

6261
04:22:24,420 --> 04:22:25,740
Yeah, but like...

6262
04:22:29,530 --> 04:22:32,570
But like, I have some guys trying to kill me.

6263
04:22:36,480 --> 04:22:40,580
You can now see the Knight of the Red Jar Great Summon?

6264
04:22:42,740 --> 04:22:43,380
Done?

6265
04:22:44,720 --> 04:22:45,740
Where is it?

6266
04:22:47,260 --> 04:22:48,320
Where's his summon?

6267
04:22:52,760 --> 04:22:54,900
Or I guess I...

6268
04:22:57,460 --> 04:22:58,020
Engage...

6269
04:22:58,020 --> 04:22:59,020
Touch the...

6270
04:22:59,740 --> 04:23:01,180
Spirit Ashes or...

6271
04:23:01,180 --> 04:23:01,700
Oh!

6272
04:23:01,840 --> 04:23:03,600
It's like a little coliseum area.

6273
04:23:03,860 --> 04:23:04,220
Oh, okay.

6274
04:23:04,280 --> 04:23:05,260
So it's useless to me.

6275
04:23:09,960 --> 04:23:11,680
On the path behind me?

6276
04:23:17,090 --> 04:23:18,190
Oh, is it that?

6277
04:23:18,790 --> 04:23:20,470
No, that's where everybody died.

6278
04:23:20,910 --> 04:23:21,910
What the fuck?

6279
04:23:22,690 --> 04:23:24,310
How did all these people die?

6280
04:23:29,960 --> 04:23:30,980
I don't know, man.

6281
04:23:35,140 --> 04:23:36,440
How did all you guys die?

6282
04:23:41,140 --> 04:23:42,860
Knight of the Great Jar?

6283
04:23:44,740 --> 04:23:46,420
Knight of the Great Jar?

6284
04:23:46,720 --> 04:23:47,700
Who are these people?

6285
04:23:52,280 --> 04:23:53,520
Is it worth it?

6286
04:23:55,940 --> 04:23:56,500
Oh.

6287
04:23:58,860 --> 04:24:01,420
Wait, but what's the point of trying to kill them?

6288
04:24:05,800 --> 04:24:06,680
It's fun.

6289
04:24:06,920 --> 04:24:07,600
Alright, I'm leaving.

6290
04:24:10,080 --> 04:24:15,020
Oh my god, I can't leave because that guy is still aggro towards me!

6291
04:24:17,940 --> 04:24:19,560
What if I don't look at him?

6292
04:24:20,500 --> 04:24:22,120
Okay, apparently that doesn't work.

6293
04:24:24,380 --> 04:24:26,500
Oh my god, I actually can't use the map.

6294
04:24:27,400 --> 04:24:29,020
I actually can't leave.

6295
04:24:30,000 --> 04:24:30,560
Left.

6296
04:24:30,860 --> 04:24:31,420
Left.

6297
04:24:33,980 --> 04:24:40,300
I can save England and go back to the aggro, that one giant that keeps aggro- That's it, I'm gonna kill him.

6298
04:24:40,760 --> 04:24:41,980
I got this.

6299
04:24:43,860 --> 04:24:45,500
Wait, go inside and crouch?

6300
04:24:47,260 --> 04:24:48,480
He doesn't know.

6301
04:24:48,820 --> 04:24:50,600
Oh, okay, he actually did it.

6302
04:24:51,120 --> 04:24:51,480
Nice.

6303
04:24:55,680 --> 04:24:57,820
Okay, we're leaving.

6304
04:24:58,000 --> 04:25:02,700
I don't wanna- I don't wanna deal- Alright, where's the story boss, guys?

6305
04:25:02,940 --> 04:25:04,580
How do we get to the story boss?

6306
04:25:07,820 --> 04:25:10,560
We'll kill one story boss before I go.

6307
04:25:16,130 --> 04:25:18,470
It's in Kaelin?!

6308
04:25:18,470 --> 04:25:19,890
Okay, we're going to the bed and coffin.

6309
04:25:20,830 --> 04:25:22,490
Is there another story boss?

6310
04:25:23,030 --> 04:25:29,810
It's- Is there- Is there- Another story boss?

6311
04:25:31,750 --> 04:25:32,590
No.

6312
04:25:39,730 --> 04:25:40,410
Okay.

6313
04:25:41,090 --> 04:25:43,030
Back to hell we go.

6314
04:25:43,350 --> 04:25:43,910
Okay.

6315
04:25:44,130 --> 04:25:47,450
Back to hell we go.

6316
04:25:49,110 --> 04:25:49,790
Alright.

6317
04:25:49,790 --> 04:25:50,010
Alright.

6318
04:25:50,410 --> 04:25:52,630
Okay, I'm gonna use the bathroom then.

6319
04:25:52,970 --> 04:25:55,770
Before I go through this cursed area.

6320
04:26:50,940 --> 04:26:51,780
I'm back.

6321
04:26:52,240 --> 04:26:54,120
I'm sad, but I'm back.

6322
04:26:58,240 --> 04:27:00,100
Getting a tab out real quick.

6323
04:27:00,360 --> 04:27:00,540
Alright.

6324
04:27:01,080 --> 04:27:02,560
Let me get back into hell.

6325
04:27:03,280 --> 04:27:03,360
Alright.

6326
04:27:07,920 --> 04:27:09,940
It's back to hell I go.

6327
04:27:11,600 --> 04:27:12,680
Oh my god, please.

6328
04:27:13,060 --> 04:27:14,760
Let me tap back in.

6329
04:27:15,240 --> 04:27:16,280
Alright, there we go.

6330
04:27:17,320 --> 04:27:21,000
Oh my god.

6331
04:27:21,000 --> 04:27:22,040
Turn back.

6332
04:27:23,140 --> 04:27:24,720
Turn back.

6333
04:27:27,780 --> 04:27:29,340
I feel you.

6334
04:27:41,460 --> 04:27:42,820
Here we go.

6335
04:27:45,860 --> 04:27:46,740
Here we go.

6336
04:27:47,220 --> 04:27:48,340
Back to hell.

6337
04:27:49,340 --> 04:27:52,640
Both sides are just as bad.

6338
04:27:59,280 --> 04:28:00,120
Oh god.

6339
04:28:00,780 --> 04:28:01,180
Oh god.

6340
04:28:01,740 --> 04:28:03,320
Wait, maybe this is how I can get this.

6341
04:28:03,860 --> 04:28:04,200
Nice.

6342
04:28:07,000 --> 04:28:09,100
What the fuck?!

6343
04:28:09,100 --> 04:28:11,340
What killed me?!

6344
04:28:21,530 --> 04:28:22,030
What?

6345
04:28:22,570 --> 04:28:24,190
Oh my god.

6346
04:28:24,190 --> 04:28:24,330
What?

6347
04:28:31,090 --> 04:28:32,330
I don't even-

6348
04:28:35,410 --> 04:28:36,490
Oh my god.

6349
04:28:36,790 --> 04:28:37,970
How many did I lost?

6350
04:28:38,350 --> 04:28:38,770
Guys.

6351
04:28:39,010 --> 04:28:40,630
How many did I lose, guys?

6352
04:28:40,990 --> 04:28:44,650
How many- How many souls did I lose?

6353
04:28:51,250 --> 04:28:52,490
I don't even know.

6354
04:28:52,690 --> 04:28:53,570
Oh my god.

6355
04:28:53,830 --> 04:28:55,210
I forgot you guys can't see it.

6356
04:28:55,790 --> 04:28:57,110
You guys couldn't even see it.

6357
04:28:57,170 --> 04:28:58,850
I don't even know how many I lost.

6358
04:28:59,270 --> 04:29:00,650
I don't remember.

6359
04:29:05,860 --> 04:29:07,400
Stupid explosion thing.

6360
04:29:07,780 --> 04:29:10,840
Oh my god, please don't tell me it's above me!

6361
04:29:15,190 --> 04:29:19,230
I swear to god, IT'S ABOVE ME!!!

6362
04:29:23,480 --> 04:29:33,110
Guys, if I TP, do I lose my grace?

6363
04:29:33,390 --> 04:29:34,070
I need a no.

6364
04:29:34,630 --> 04:29:36,010
Guys, before I go up.

6365
04:29:42,040 --> 04:29:44,140
If I TP, do I lose it?

6366
04:29:44,820 --> 04:29:45,380
No?

6367
04:29:45,380 --> 04:29:45,940
Oh, okay.

6368
04:29:52,300 --> 04:29:52,900
Okay.

6369
04:29:53,420 --> 04:29:57,000
Okay, that's all I need to know before I go back to hell.

6370
04:29:59,220 --> 04:30:00,460
That's good to know.

6371
04:30:02,200 --> 04:30:04,100
Stupid fucking bear.

6372
04:30:04,660 --> 04:30:05,820
I see it.

6373
04:30:06,020 --> 04:30:08,100
How did it go here?

6374
04:30:10,140 --> 04:30:16,240
Of course it wants to be as close as possible to this goddamn bear.

6375
04:30:22,170 --> 04:30:23,230
Oh my god.

6376
04:30:23,230 --> 04:30:24,410
Oh my god.

6377
04:30:24,590 --> 04:30:27,170
I don't know how I survived, but I did.

6378
04:30:27,690 --> 04:30:28,110
I...

6379
04:30:30,770 --> 04:30:31,690
That's fine.

6380
04:30:32,290 --> 04:30:33,130
That's fine.

6381
04:30:33,490 --> 04:30:35,390
It was 7,000, by the way.

6382
04:30:35,630 --> 04:30:37,570
Thank god I... Thank god.

6383
04:30:38,090 --> 04:30:39,090
Thank god.

6384
04:30:41,410 --> 04:30:43,630
It was actually... It was 7,000.

6385
04:30:43,850 --> 04:30:46,290
I'm glad I... I'm glad I didn't risk it.

6386
04:30:46,450 --> 04:30:49,170
Oh my god, I'm not gonna... I'm not gonna bother.

6387
04:30:49,170 --> 04:30:51,190
You can... You can... You can keep it.

6388
04:30:51,550 --> 04:30:53,010
You can fucking keep it.

6389
04:30:55,030 --> 04:30:56,450
Oh my god.

6390
04:30:57,170 --> 04:30:58,650
I was trying to do my map.

6391
04:31:00,010 --> 04:31:02,250
Okay, which way is the boss, guys?

6392
04:31:02,630 --> 04:31:03,530
Which way?

6393
04:31:06,690 --> 04:31:07,970
Which way, chat?

6394
04:31:08,670 --> 04:31:10,450
North, South, East, West...

6395
04:31:12,210 --> 04:31:12,850
East.

6396
04:31:12,990 --> 04:31:13,230
Okay.

6397
04:31:13,810 --> 04:31:15,330
I go East now.

6398
04:31:16,050 --> 04:31:16,590
South?

6399
04:31:16,830 --> 04:31:18,210
Okay, I go South, East.

6400
04:31:20,730 --> 04:31:22,770
Oh my god, thank god there's a Grace.

6401
04:31:23,090 --> 04:31:24,430
In the middle of hell.

6402
04:31:25,290 --> 04:31:26,630
Thank... my god.

6403
04:31:30,350 --> 04:31:31,310
Thank god.

6404
04:31:31,550 --> 04:31:33,670
I found... I found a Grace.

6405
04:31:34,330 --> 04:31:34,830
Okay.

6406
04:31:34,910 --> 04:31:36,930
I might don't have enough to level up.

6407
04:31:37,370 --> 04:31:38,010
Oh yeah.

6408
04:31:38,090 --> 04:31:38,770
I definitely do.

6409
04:31:41,370 --> 04:31:43,770
Wait, actually... Let me double check.

6410
04:31:44,830 --> 04:31:50,370
1600, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

6411
04:31:50,730 --> 04:31:51,930
I need 5k.

6412
04:31:53,010 --> 04:31:53,990
Do I need 5k?

6413
04:31:56,290 --> 04:31:57,450
Let me double check.

6414
04:31:57,850 --> 04:31:58,790
Yeah, I just need 5k.

6415
04:31:59,830 --> 04:32:03,370
I'll just... I'll just crack open all these runes real quick.

6416
04:32:08,040 --> 04:32:08,720
Alright.

6417
04:32:08,720 --> 04:32:08,820
Alright.

6418
04:32:13,280 --> 04:32:18,620
Okay, and then... We keep using until we get 12k.

6419
04:32:19,360 --> 04:32:21,960
I'm pretty sure we have just enough.

6420
04:32:22,800 --> 04:32:24,120
I'm pretty sure.

6421
04:32:26,460 --> 04:32:27,860
Yeah, we definitely have enough.

6422
04:32:31,300 --> 04:32:32,540
Okay, just one more.

6423
04:32:36,020 --> 04:32:37,800
Oh wait, we... Yeah, okay, there you go.

6424
04:32:38,400 --> 04:32:39,540
Yeah, we just had enough.

6425
04:32:40,300 --> 04:32:40,680
Alright.

6426
04:32:40,680 --> 04:32:40,760
Alright.

6427
04:32:42,440 --> 04:32:45,720
Can we do Vigor or Dexterity chat?

6428
04:32:52,500 --> 04:32:53,940
Vigor or Dexterity?

6429
04:32:55,680 --> 04:32:56,740
More damage?

6430
04:32:57,920 --> 04:32:58,580
Alright.

6431
04:33:01,180 --> 04:33:02,700
Vigor for this area?

6432
04:33:02,920 --> 04:33:03,140
Okay.

6433
04:33:04,320 --> 04:33:06,180
I'll do Dexterity next then.

6434
04:33:07,560 --> 04:33:08,240
Alright.

6435
04:33:08,580 --> 04:33:13,000
Time to figure out where the fuck is the goddamn... Wait, what's that?

6436
04:33:16,160 --> 04:33:17,080
Is that it?

6437
04:33:17,560 --> 04:33:18,740
Oh my god!

6438
04:33:19,000 --> 04:33:19,720
Okay, guys!

6439
04:33:20,120 --> 04:33:23,000
Did you take me to a non-fucking-story boss again?

6440
04:33:23,440 --> 04:33:24,620
I fucking... Okay.

6441
04:33:29,470 --> 04:33:30,050
Goddammit.

6442
04:33:30,730 --> 04:33:32,410
Guys, I'll have you, no?

6443
04:33:33,950 --> 04:33:36,770
We're ending the stream without killing a story boss.

6444
04:33:37,030 --> 04:33:38,150
This is the last boss.

6445
04:33:38,310 --> 04:33:39,030
This is on you.

6446
04:33:39,290 --> 04:33:40,450
This is on you.

6447
04:33:46,360 --> 04:33:48,880
You went in there.

6448
04:33:49,020 --> 04:33:50,640
You guys said East!

6449
04:33:50,920 --> 04:33:52,740
I went East!

6450
04:33:58,870 --> 04:33:59,750
I went East!

6451
04:33:59,750 --> 04:33:59,750
Okay.

6452
04:34:01,710 --> 04:34:03,090
I went East.

6453
04:34:03,310 --> 04:34:04,410
I just listened.

6454
04:34:04,610 --> 04:34:05,450
I listened.

6455
04:34:05,450 --> 04:34:05,450
I demonstrated.

6456
04:34:05,450 --> 04:34:10,170
I didn't... Ahhaha... Rah-aahaaah!

6457
04:34:10,490 --> 04:34:10,490
Rah-Eah!

6458
04:34:10,490 --> 04:34:10,530
Ha-haah!

6459
04:34:10,530 --> 04:34:10,730
And concepts!

6460
04:34:14,110 --> 04:34:16,530
Thank you for Magenta Super!

6461
04:34:16,870 --> 04:34:17,190
Thank you.

6462
04:34:17,370 --> 04:34:17,910
Thank you.

6463
04:34:19,670 --> 04:34:21,190
Oh my god.

6464
04:34:21,790 --> 04:34:23,230
Oh my god.

6465
04:34:23,530 --> 04:34:25,590
He does so much!

6466
04:34:25,850 --> 04:34:28,250
He does so much damage!

6467
04:34:28,250 --> 04:34:28,450
Damn it.

6468
04:34:37,200 --> 04:34:41,240
Guys, I don't think I'm good enough for it.

6469
04:34:42,840 --> 04:34:44,320
I said for ourselves.

6470
04:34:45,300 --> 04:34:46,780
Alright, alright guys.

6471
04:34:47,340 --> 04:34:49,860
After we die, we find the story boss.

6472
04:34:50,040 --> 04:34:51,120
I'm not fighting him.

6473
04:34:52,460 --> 04:34:53,660
He's scary.

6474
04:34:53,660 --> 04:34:54,540
I'm scared.

6475
04:34:58,440 --> 04:35:00,240
I'm so scared.

6476
04:35:03,100 --> 04:35:04,020
My god.

6477
04:35:04,860 --> 04:35:06,800
He's very scary, guys.

6478
04:35:11,510 --> 04:35:13,070
I'm very scared.

6479
04:35:13,750 --> 04:35:17,070
He seems to know what he's doing, guys.

6480
04:35:20,330 --> 04:35:21,650
Holy fuck.

6481
04:35:22,570 --> 04:35:25,050
Guys, he definitely knows what he's doing.

6482
04:35:30,780 --> 04:35:31,500
Okay.

6483
04:35:36,640 --> 04:35:37,360
Okay.

6484
04:35:39,700 --> 04:35:40,280
Okay.

6485
04:35:40,280 --> 04:35:40,340
Alright.

6486
04:35:40,780 --> 04:35:42,800
I got two hits in off my gaming.

6487
04:35:47,440 --> 04:35:50,220
I guess I'm no longer gaming, guys.

6488
04:35:50,520 --> 04:35:51,900
Guys, I'm no longer gaming.

6489
04:35:52,400 --> 04:35:52,840
I'm...

6490
04:36:14,430 --> 04:36:14,870
I'm...

6491
04:36:16,030 --> 04:36:17,630
At least I know his patterns.

6492
04:36:17,990 --> 04:36:18,310
Sorta.

6493
04:36:20,510 --> 04:36:21,330
Oh my god.

6494
04:36:22,170 --> 04:36:22,650
God, get out.

6495
04:36:22,750 --> 04:36:23,190
God, get out.

6496
04:36:28,870 --> 04:36:29,670
Wait, what?

6497
04:36:30,030 --> 04:36:30,850
Wait, what?

6498
04:36:31,590 --> 04:36:32,550
What is he doing?

6499
04:36:34,270 --> 04:36:34,870
What are you...

6500
04:36:37,130 --> 04:36:38,570
They're behind me, aren't they?

6501
04:36:38,570 --> 04:36:39,370
Okay.

6502
04:36:39,370 --> 04:36:40,070
Oh my god.

6503
04:36:40,250 --> 04:36:40,410
Okay.

6504
04:36:40,590 --> 04:36:41,370
I just need to...

6505
04:36:41,370 --> 04:36:42,130
I need to know.

6506
04:36:42,310 --> 04:36:42,910
Do these...

6507
04:36:42,910 --> 04:36:43,430
Can these...

6508
04:36:43,430 --> 04:36:44,550
Do these guys despawn?

6509
04:36:44,690 --> 04:36:47,090
Do these guys despawn before I try to kill them?

6510
04:36:47,290 --> 04:36:48,370
Do they despawn?

6511
04:36:53,680 --> 04:36:54,400
Do they...

6512
04:36:54,400 --> 04:36:54,620
No.

6513
04:36:54,820 --> 04:36:55,140
Okay.

6514
04:36:55,360 --> 04:36:55,680
Alright.

6515
04:36:56,000 --> 04:36:56,220
Alright.

6516
04:36:56,340 --> 04:36:57,440
He summoned his squad.

6517
04:36:57,760 --> 04:36:58,200
Okay.

6518
04:36:58,420 --> 04:36:58,640
Alright.

6519
04:36:58,820 --> 04:36:59,340
Phase two.

6520
04:36:59,540 --> 04:37:00,000
Phase two.

6521
04:37:00,340 --> 04:37:03,480
Man, I wish I could summon my squad numerous times.

6522
04:37:03,800 --> 04:37:04,940
That'd be so cool.

6523
04:37:04,940 --> 04:37:04,980
Cool.

6524
04:37:07,040 --> 04:37:08,920
Oh my god.

6525
04:37:09,760 --> 04:37:11,300
Oh my god.

6526
04:37:12,340 --> 04:37:13,900
Yeah, they do, Dookie.

6527
04:37:14,020 --> 04:37:15,380
When you kill the boss.

6528
04:37:23,120 --> 04:37:25,760
I wish there was friendly fire.

6529
04:37:26,340 --> 04:37:28,100
I wish there was friendly fire.

6530
04:37:29,140 --> 04:37:31,880
If only there was friendly fire.

6531
04:37:31,880 --> 04:37:34,200
And then they can hit each other.

6532
04:37:35,220 --> 04:37:36,640
Oh my god.

6533
04:37:36,820 --> 04:37:38,440
Of course he boosts your attack.

6534
04:37:38,720 --> 04:37:39,460
Of course.

6535
04:37:40,580 --> 04:37:42,320
Oh, look at course.

6536
04:37:50,440 --> 04:37:55,100
You gotta respect that the boys coming in clutch.

6537
04:37:56,820 --> 04:37:57,820
Oh.

6538
04:38:02,420 --> 04:38:02,920
Okay.

6539
04:38:03,120 --> 04:38:03,740
Oh my god.

6540
04:38:03,740 --> 04:38:04,940
I stood next to the...

6541
04:38:04,940 --> 04:38:05,560
Goddamn.

6542
04:38:06,720 --> 04:38:07,240
Alright.

6543
04:38:09,580 --> 04:38:10,580
Alright.

6544
04:38:11,520 --> 04:38:12,320
Which way?

6545
04:38:19,620 --> 04:38:20,120
Alright.

6546
04:38:24,260 --> 04:38:25,600
Which way?

6547
04:38:25,900 --> 04:38:26,940
I forgot.

6548
04:38:27,400 --> 04:38:28,620
Which way was it?

6549
04:38:30,360 --> 04:38:30,800
South.

6550
04:38:31,120 --> 04:38:31,180
East.

6551
04:38:31,540 --> 04:38:31,640
Okay.

6552
04:38:31,820 --> 04:38:32,300
So this way.

6553
04:38:33,700 --> 04:38:34,140
Alright.

6554
04:38:34,260 --> 04:38:35,000
That's South East.

6555
04:38:42,040 --> 04:38:43,360
Do we go through the swamp?

6556
04:38:43,400 --> 04:38:44,120
Or do we go up?

6557
04:38:44,280 --> 04:38:44,980
I'm gonna go up.

6558
04:38:49,060 --> 04:38:49,500
Here?

6559
04:38:52,120 --> 04:38:52,560
Yeah.

6560
04:38:52,660 --> 04:38:54,340
I know that that's where the map is.

6561
04:38:54,500 --> 04:38:56,200
But I'm trying to find the boss right now.

6562
04:38:58,660 --> 04:38:59,100
Up?

6563
04:38:59,380 --> 04:39:00,140
Like up here?

6564
04:39:01,540 --> 04:39:03,020
Or do we go through the castle?

6565
04:39:06,740 --> 04:39:07,220
Oh shit.

6566
04:39:07,220 --> 04:39:08,000
Want me to grab the map?

6567
04:39:08,120 --> 04:39:08,460
Oh shit.

6568
04:39:08,720 --> 04:39:10,020
Oh I can't look at it.

6569
04:39:18,380 --> 04:39:19,460
Is this the cliff?

6570
04:39:25,020 --> 04:39:25,660
Oh hey.

6571
04:39:28,680 --> 04:39:29,160
Here.

6572
04:39:30,240 --> 04:39:30,960
What's here?

6573
04:39:33,220 --> 04:39:34,120
Vision's a cliff.

6574
04:39:34,920 --> 04:39:35,600
Yeah.

6575
04:39:35,760 --> 04:39:36,860
I'm not going down there.

6576
04:39:37,020 --> 04:39:37,760
You can't trick me.

6577
04:39:38,840 --> 04:39:40,200
I can't...

6578
04:39:40,200 --> 04:39:40,340
Wait.

6579
04:39:43,180 --> 04:39:44,200
I don't know.

6580
04:39:44,340 --> 04:39:45,360
Maybe if I'm...

6581
04:39:45,360 --> 04:39:48,040
Maybe if I'm very, very quiet.

6582
04:39:52,880 --> 04:39:54,060
I figure out how to get down.

6583
04:39:55,580 --> 04:39:57,140
Oh is that the boss area?

6584
04:39:57,700 --> 04:39:58,920
How do you get down?

6585
04:39:59,800 --> 04:40:01,040
Oh do we go back to the castle?

6586
04:40:01,380 --> 04:40:01,520
Okay.

6587
04:40:08,840 --> 04:40:09,200
Alright.

6588
04:40:11,220 --> 04:40:12,500
We try to go to the castle.

6589
04:40:15,200 --> 04:40:15,720
Okay.

6590
04:40:15,820 --> 04:40:15,900
Okay.

6591
04:40:15,900 --> 04:40:16,840
That's not self guys.

6592
04:40:17,080 --> 04:40:18,020
Self is this way.

6593
04:40:18,840 --> 04:40:19,700
Assume it's here.

6594
04:40:20,400 --> 04:40:21,400
Oh not this way?

6595
04:40:22,380 --> 04:40:23,820
Oh that's not the right castle.

6596
04:40:23,940 --> 04:40:24,280
Other...

6597
04:40:24,280 --> 04:40:25,540
There's another castle?

6598
04:40:28,880 --> 04:40:30,460
Where's the other castle?

6599
04:40:38,670 --> 04:40:39,570
Is this way?

6600
04:40:41,910 --> 04:40:42,710
I'm self.

6601
04:40:49,830 --> 04:40:51,070
Oh hey there's a merchant.

6602
04:40:51,310 --> 04:40:51,610
Hello.

6603
04:40:53,310 --> 04:40:54,530
Wait where's the merchant?

6604
04:40:54,730 --> 04:40:55,190
It's just a...

6605
04:40:55,190 --> 04:40:55,710
Oh there he is.

6606
04:40:55,850 --> 04:40:56,630
Oh there he is.

6607
04:41:01,120 --> 04:41:02,720
There's more than one castle?

6608
04:41:03,040 --> 04:41:03,900
Oh there you go.

6609
04:41:08,130 --> 04:41:09,650
Okay so I just go down.

6610
04:41:10,430 --> 04:41:11,190
From here.

6611
04:41:11,650 --> 04:41:13,030
Oh that's a lot of dogs.

6612
04:41:13,930 --> 04:41:15,970
I don't think they look friendly guys.

6613
04:41:15,970 --> 04:41:18,310
They definitely do not look friendly.

6614
04:41:18,870 --> 04:41:20,090
Wait where's the map?

6615
04:41:21,070 --> 04:41:22,290
Wait I missed the map.

6616
04:41:22,510 --> 04:41:23,270
Oh it's right here.

6617
04:41:23,490 --> 04:41:24,270
I see it.

6618
04:41:27,070 --> 04:41:29,090
I see it's behind me isn't it?

6619
04:41:31,690 --> 04:41:33,410
Oh I got golden seed though.

6620
04:41:33,930 --> 04:41:35,010
That was worth it.

6621
04:41:37,530 --> 04:41:39,050
Like right here somewhere.

6622
04:41:45,770 --> 04:41:46,970
It's like here?

6623
04:41:49,590 --> 04:41:50,190
Hello?

6624
04:41:51,110 --> 04:41:52,130
Map Doko?

6625
04:41:53,310 --> 04:41:54,510
Oh there it is.

6626
04:41:54,650 --> 04:41:55,230
I see it.

6627
04:41:56,550 --> 04:41:58,290
This is literally right behind me.

6628
04:41:59,030 --> 04:41:59,830
Okay there we go.

6629
04:42:02,230 --> 04:42:03,690
Oh is this castle?

6630
04:42:04,430 --> 04:42:05,290
Right here?

6631
04:42:12,180 --> 04:42:12,740
Okay.

6632
04:42:12,980 --> 04:42:14,460

6634
04:42:20,030 --> 04:42:20,510

Okay so I just have to go here.

6636
04:42:24,710 --> 04:42:24,890
Alright.

6637
04:42:27,110 --> 04:42:27,910
Here we go.

6638
04:42:31,990 --> 04:42:33,830
We're gonna make it...

6639
04:42:33,830 --> 04:42:35,650
All the way to the other side.

6640
04:42:38,470 --> 04:42:38,950
Alright.

6641
04:42:39,270 --> 04:42:41,770
How under level am I for this boss though?

6642
04:42:42,410 --> 04:42:42,790

6643
04:42:42,790 --> 04:42:44,290

6644
04:42:44,290 --> 04:42:44,310

6645
04:42:46,650 --> 04:42:48,370
How fucked am I?

6646
04:42:55,810 --> 04:42:57,290
He's pretty tough.

6647
04:42:57,890 --> 04:43:00,390
Alright guys if we...

6648
04:43:00,390 --> 04:43:01,430
Oh my god.

6649
04:43:01,590 --> 04:43:01,990
The wall.

6650
04:43:02,210 --> 04:43:03,150
My biggest enemy.

6651
04:43:03,890 --> 04:43:04,830
Oh hey there's a portal.

6652
04:43:10,780 --> 04:43:11,300
Yes.

6653
04:43:12,060 --> 04:43:13,560
Wait are they fighting each other?

6654
04:43:17,050 --> 04:43:18,510
Oh I can get more flask.

6655
04:43:24,970 --> 04:43:25,490
Yes.

6656
04:43:25,490 --> 04:43:26,230
Yay.

6657
04:43:28,630 --> 04:43:29,090
Alright.

6658
04:43:29,250 --> 04:43:30,290
Time to touch the portal.

6659
04:43:34,600 --> 04:43:35,060
Boop.

6660
04:43:38,480 --> 04:43:39,160
I hear how...

6661
04:43:39,160 --> 04:43:41,620
I always have that unimpressed high expression.

6662
04:43:42,020 --> 04:43:43,120
Alright thank you for the super chat.

6663
04:43:43,240 --> 04:43:43,480
Thank you.

6664
04:43:43,620 --> 04:43:44,100
Thank you.

6665
04:43:45,880 --> 04:43:46,880
Wait I made it.

6666
04:43:47,040 --> 04:43:47,780
Oh that was easy.

6667
04:43:48,140 --> 04:43:48,840
I'm here.

6668
04:43:50,980 --> 04:43:51,960
Now where do I go?

6669
04:43:56,840 --> 04:43:58,460
Did I get to that castle?

6670
04:44:05,370 --> 04:44:05,830
Here?

6671
04:44:14,400 --> 04:44:15,900
There's two paths.

6672
04:44:17,020 --> 04:44:18,760
There's two wolves inside me.

6673
04:44:20,960 --> 04:44:22,440
I guess I'll go this way.

6674
04:44:22,640 --> 04:44:23,580
I see Grace here.

6675
04:44:31,050 --> 04:44:31,420
Yay.

6676
04:44:36,240 --> 04:44:36,610
Alright.

6677
04:44:39,200 --> 04:44:40,170
Guess we go here.

6678
04:44:43,320 --> 04:44:44,620
Are they friendly?

6679
04:44:44,920 --> 04:44:45,640
Oh friendly!

6680
04:44:46,820 --> 04:44:47,540
Oh!

6681
04:44:47,800 --> 04:44:48,700
There are two wolves!

6682
04:44:48,980 --> 04:44:50,220
I caught it!

6683
04:44:53,460 --> 04:44:54,740
Where's wolf number two?

6684
04:44:56,160 --> 04:44:57,860
Allow me to introduce myself.

6685
04:44:58,860 --> 04:44:59,240
Live.

6686
04:45:03,300 --> 04:45:05,820
We find ourselves pitted against Radan.

6687
04:45:06,400 --> 04:45:06,980
I'm gonna...

6688
04:45:06,980 --> 04:45:08,160
Okay I'm gonna be like...

6689
04:45:09,040 --> 04:45:09,980
I'm not AFK.

6690
04:45:10,120 --> 04:45:11,260
I'm just ordering food.

6691
04:45:11,260 --> 04:45:12,700
Cause I'm like...

6692
04:45:12,700 --> 04:45:13,460
Oh shit it's late.

6693
04:45:15,880 --> 04:45:16,420
Huh?

6694
04:45:17,760 --> 04:45:20,460
Oh isn't that the wolf that everyone wants to fuck?

6695
04:45:22,060 --> 04:45:23,320
That's that wolf right?

6696
04:45:23,680 --> 04:45:24,580
The bang wolf?

6697
04:45:30,800 --> 04:45:31,700
Alright.

6698
04:45:32,020 --> 04:45:32,140
Ooh.

6699
04:45:32,480 --> 04:45:32,600
Okay.

6700
04:45:32,680 --> 04:45:33,290
I'm gonna get...

6701
04:45:33,800 --> 04:45:35,180
BBQ beef.

6702
04:45:36,040 --> 04:45:36,940
And...

6703
04:45:36,940 --> 04:45:38,300
BBQ...

6704
04:45:39,010 --> 04:45:39,460
Lamb.

6705
04:45:40,120 --> 04:45:40,540
Cool.

6706
04:45:40,780 --> 04:45:41,660
You know those like...

6707
04:45:41,660 --> 04:45:42,780
Chinese...

6708
04:45:42,780 --> 04:45:43,560
Like skewers?

6709
04:45:45,100 --> 04:45:46,120
I love those.

6710
04:45:46,480 --> 04:45:46,920
I love those.

6711
04:45:46,920 --> 04:45:47,460
They're so good.

6712
04:45:48,440 --> 04:45:50,360
Grabbing the beef and lamb one.

6713
04:45:50,720 --> 04:45:52,300
I haven't had those in a long time.

6714
04:45:55,740 --> 04:45:57,400
Let's see what else should I get.

6715
04:45:57,400 --> 04:45:57,860
Hmm.

6716
04:46:00,400 --> 04:46:00,920
Uh...

6717
04:46:00,920 --> 04:46:01,720
Show this to Bob.

6718
04:46:01,880 --> 04:46:02,880
Watch her go crazy.

6719
04:46:03,420 --> 04:46:04,660
I saw like...

6720
04:46:04,660 --> 04:46:05,680
You know how like...

6721
04:46:05,680 --> 04:46:07,060
You can see like tweets from...

6722
04:46:07,060 --> 04:46:07,960
Your followers.

6723
04:46:08,120 --> 04:46:08,980
Like people you follow.

6724
04:46:09,400 --> 04:46:10,800
Like the replies and stuff.

6725
04:46:11,040 --> 04:46:14,620
And then someone was cosplaying that wolf guy from the...

6726
04:46:14,620 --> 04:46:15,040
What was it?

6727
04:46:15,100 --> 04:46:15,480
ZZZ.

6728
04:46:15,920 --> 04:46:18,100
And I saw her reply to one of them.

6729
04:46:18,180 --> 04:46:19,020
And was like...

6730
04:46:19,020 --> 04:46:19,340
Uh...

6731
04:46:19,340 --> 04:46:20,220
Are you single?

6732
04:46:24,420 --> 04:46:25,760
I saw that.

6733
04:46:28,540 --> 04:46:29,140
Alright.

6734
04:46:29,820 --> 04:46:31,280
See I think that's all I wanna order.

6735
04:46:31,380 --> 04:46:32,480
That's already a lot of food.

6736
04:46:32,700 --> 04:46:34,740
Cause there's like five skewers for each.

6737
04:46:36,560 --> 04:46:37,160
Uh...

6738
04:46:37,160 --> 04:46:38,600
Is that really all I wanna order?

6739
04:46:38,820 --> 04:46:39,160
Yeah.

6740
04:46:40,020 --> 04:46:40,320
Alright.

6741
04:46:42,020 --> 04:46:43,220
Quest utensils.

6742
04:46:44,200 --> 04:46:46,340
It's too late to like make anything.

6743
04:46:47,640 --> 04:46:47,980
Alright.

6744
04:46:48,600 --> 04:46:49,200
Nice.

6745
04:46:53,230 --> 04:46:53,830
C'mon.

6746
04:46:54,810 --> 04:46:56,090
Gimme my food.

6747
04:46:56,470 --> 04:46:56,770
Alright.

6748
04:46:57,030 --> 04:46:57,450
Let's go.

6749
04:46:59,150 --> 04:46:59,690
I'm back.

6750
04:47:00,330 --> 04:47:01,190
Champions.

6751
04:47:01,350 --> 04:47:02,170
That's me.

6752
04:47:02,830 --> 04:47:03,260
Hello.

6753
04:47:04,010 --> 04:47:05,670
The stars have aligned.

6754
04:47:06,130 --> 04:47:08,890
The festival is nigh.

6755
04:47:10,050 --> 04:47:10,310
Uh...

6756
04:47:10,310 --> 04:47:10,990
Time for...

6757
04:47:10,990 --> 04:47:11,930
Oh hey friend!

6758
04:47:12,490 --> 04:47:16,170
My dear's demigod of the shattering awaits you.

6759
04:47:16,670 --> 04:47:17,530
Champions.

6760
04:47:18,630 --> 04:47:20,890
Prepare for battle.

6761
04:47:21,270 --> 04:47:22,150
I'm so ready.

6762
04:47:22,810 --> 04:47:24,050
Wait and...

6763
04:47:24,050 --> 04:47:25,130
That's him!

6764
04:47:25,130 --> 04:47:26,750
I see him in memes!

6765
04:47:27,170 --> 04:47:27,270
I see him in memes!

6766
04:47:36,120 --> 04:47:36,600
Yay!

6767
04:47:38,200 --> 04:47:39,940
I'm so ready for the festival.

6768
04:47:40,200 --> 04:47:41,800
Are you ready for the festival guys?

6769
04:47:43,940 --> 04:47:46,380
People say that one day I'll be the Elden Lord.

6770
04:47:46,380 --> 04:47:46,400
Oh boy.

6771
04:47:46,640 --> 04:47:48,600
If it isn't a tarnished warrior.

6772
04:47:48,860 --> 04:47:51,020
I am the warrior jar.

6773
04:47:51,220 --> 04:47:53,160
Iron fist Alexander.

6774
04:47:53,540 --> 04:47:55,560
The pleasure is mine.

6775
04:47:55,820 --> 04:47:56,440
Hello Alexander.

6776
04:47:57,000 --> 04:47:58,060
I saw your dad.

6777
04:47:58,060 --> 04:47:59,340
This festival is being held.

6778
04:47:59,920 --> 04:48:00,300
Well...

6779
04:48:00,680 --> 04:48:05,940
It is none other than General Radahn himself to think.

6780
04:48:06,200 --> 04:48:09,660
I could face a great champion of the shattering.

6781
04:48:10,380 --> 04:48:12,420
A demigod in the flesh.

6782
04:48:12,420 --> 04:48:13,380
Oh gosh.

6783
04:48:13,380 --> 04:48:14,020
Oh gosh.

6784
04:48:14,440 --> 04:48:17,120
In truth, I quiver at the thought.

6785
04:48:17,840 --> 04:48:19,560
Such is his frightful repute.

6786
04:48:20,260 --> 04:48:24,760
But, the fear simply assures me the ordeal is worth undertaking.

6787
04:48:25,380 --> 04:48:27,580
Be sure to get a good vantage my friend.

6788
04:48:28,420 --> 04:48:34,960
I, Iron Fist Alexander, do hereby vow to unflinchingly brave this ordeal.

6789
04:48:36,020 --> 04:48:36,820
Oh.

6790
04:48:37,220 --> 04:48:38,440
I got this.

6791
04:48:38,660 --> 04:48:39,440
Don't worry guys.

6792
04:48:40,140 --> 04:48:41,180
Don't worry Alexander.

6793
04:48:41,180 --> 04:48:43,560
I'll prove to you all.

6794
04:48:44,200 --> 04:48:45,280
First off.

6795
04:48:46,540 --> 04:48:47,920
I'll prove to you all.

6796
04:48:48,000 --> 04:48:50,540
That I deserve the title of Eldendorn.

6797
04:48:56,080 --> 04:48:56,980
Give up.

6798
04:49:03,380 --> 04:49:04,620
Alright, I'm ready.

6799
04:49:06,080 --> 04:49:08,560
That message is for future Doki.

6800
04:49:11,520 --> 04:49:13,540
That's for future Doki to see.

6801
04:49:14,220 --> 04:49:15,800
When I get back here.

6802
04:49:16,840 --> 04:49:18,840
Are you good and prepared young chum?

6803
04:49:19,240 --> 04:49:20,240
Yeah, I'm so ready.

6804
04:49:21,060 --> 04:49:21,300
The festival begins.

6805
04:49:23,400 --> 04:49:25,020
Ready as I'll ever be.

6806
04:49:27,080 --> 04:49:28,440
Before we begin.

6807
04:49:29,100 --> 04:49:30,540
Allow me to paint you.

6808
04:49:30,540 --> 04:49:31,200
Oh shit.

6809
04:49:31,420 --> 04:49:32,340
Wait, it's this guy.

6810
04:49:32,480 --> 04:49:33,700
Wait, I know this cutscene.

6811
04:49:33,940 --> 04:49:36,040
I've seen this cutscene before.

6812
04:49:36,040 --> 04:49:37,260
Oh fuck.

6813
04:49:45,570 --> 04:49:47,990
I have to lower the difficulty.

6814
04:49:48,390 --> 04:49:51,250
Why did you guys bring me to this one?

6815
04:49:54,590 --> 04:49:56,530
I didn't remember his name.

6816
04:49:56,790 --> 04:49:58,490
I just remember his cutscene.

6817
04:50:15,230 --> 04:50:15,710
Wait.

6818
04:50:15,950 --> 04:50:17,550
That's the first Elden Lord, right?

6819
04:50:18,750 --> 04:50:20,250
I mean, they got crazy.

6820
04:50:28,340 --> 04:50:30,340
I should have stopped at the last one.

6821
04:50:30,340 --> 04:50:31,680
I should have...

6822
04:50:31,680 --> 04:50:34,840
But now, we must make merry.

6823
04:50:35,020 --> 04:50:36,120
I should have stopped.

6824
04:50:36,520 --> 04:50:38,340
I should have stopped at the first one.

6825
04:50:38,520 --> 04:50:39,800
The Rebels begin.

6826
04:50:40,000 --> 04:50:41,760
I should have stopped at the last boss.

6827
04:50:49,060 --> 04:50:50,800
Oh no.

6828
04:50:51,900 --> 04:50:52,760
Oh no.

6829
04:50:55,640 --> 04:50:55,720
Oh no.

6830
04:50:55,720 --> 04:50:56,040
Oh no.

6831
04:50:56,040 --> 04:50:56,060
Oh no.

6832
04:50:56,060 --> 04:50:57,400
Oh, Cogger ahead.

6833
04:50:58,460 --> 04:50:59,440
Try Warrior.

6834
04:51:04,380 --> 04:51:05,600
Time...

6835
04:51:05,600 --> 04:51:08,400
Time for...

6836
04:51:08,400 --> 04:51:13,960
or is it...

6837
04:51:13,960 --> 04:51:14,760
Hahaha.

6838
04:51:16,900 --> 04:51:19,080
Where's that phrase that I need?

6839
04:51:21,340 --> 04:51:21,760
Heh.

6840
04:51:22,040 --> 04:51:22,500
Time.

6841
04:51:29,380 --> 04:51:30,220
Hahaha.

6842
04:51:32,240 --> 04:51:33,020
Help me.

6843
04:51:37,500 --> 04:51:38,920
Oh, man.

6844
04:51:43,500 --> 04:51:45,280
Alright, here we go.

6845
04:51:46,680 --> 04:51:47,760
Uh, item.

6846
04:51:48,000 --> 04:51:49,320
Let's grab the item first.

6847
04:51:51,040 --> 04:51:52,860
Alright, here we go.

6848
04:51:53,520 --> 04:51:55,200
First stop, champion ahead.

6849
04:51:56,980 --> 04:51:58,860
Seek a strong foe.

6850
04:51:59,060 --> 04:51:59,900
Oh, man.

6851
04:52:00,860 --> 04:52:02,020
Oh, man.

6852
04:52:02,600 --> 04:52:06,120
And I know he has two phases too, right?

6853
04:52:06,720 --> 04:52:09,880
They brought out the Halo Choir soundtrack.

6854
04:52:10,340 --> 04:52:13,020
You knew this was gonna be typical.

6855
04:52:13,500 --> 04:52:15,060
Don't worry, it'll be easy.

6856
04:52:15,060 --> 04:52:17,020
They even nerfed him, Doki.

6857
04:52:17,440 --> 04:52:18,860
It'll be fine.

6858
04:52:25,040 --> 04:52:26,440
Alright.

6859
04:52:27,100 --> 04:52:28,040
Here we go.

6860
04:52:37,060 --> 04:52:38,940
Oh, man.

6861
04:52:39,700 --> 04:52:41,100
Oh!

6862
04:52:45,650 --> 04:52:46,830
Oh!

6863
04:52:49,350 --> 04:52:50,170
Okay.

6864
04:52:51,750 --> 04:52:52,630
I deserve that.

6865
04:52:53,010 --> 04:52:53,390
I...

6866
04:52:53,390 --> 04:52:54,430
I need...

6867
04:53:02,920 --> 04:53:04,280
I need...

6868
04:53:04,280 --> 04:53:04,400
I need...

6869
04:53:04,400 --> 04:53:04,960
I need...

6870
04:53:04,960 --> 04:53:06,780
I need...

6871
04:53:08,080 --> 04:53:09,620
Guys, do I got this?

6872
04:53:09,700 --> 04:53:12,580
Or do I need this to do a future Doki?

6873
04:53:12,580 --> 04:53:16,700
Maybe I should let future Doki have this...

6874
04:53:17,240 --> 04:53:20,380
Maybe I need...

6875
04:53:20,380 --> 04:53:37,610
Maybe I

6876
04:53:43,490 --> 04:53:51,250
should let future Doki have this...

6877
04:53:51,250 --> 04:53:52,010
I don't know.

6878
04:53:52,470 --> 04:53:53,730
I don't know.

6879
04:53:53,730 --> 04:53:55,270
Oh, my God!

6880
04:53:55,270 --> 04:53:57,090
Oh my god!

6881
04:54:05,990 --> 04:54:09,910
What the f...

6882
04:54:09,910 --> 04:54:11,370
Oh my god, please.

6883
04:54:12,290 --> 04:54:12,910
Please.

6884
04:54:16,440 --> 04:54:17,840
Oh my god, I have buddies.

6885
04:54:18,200 --> 04:54:19,340
I have friends.

6886
04:54:20,200 --> 04:54:21,700
Oh, I have friends!

6887
04:54:22,700 --> 04:54:23,700
No, we have friends.

6888
04:54:26,160 --> 04:54:29,500
How does this tiny horse able to pick him up?

6889
04:54:33,470 --> 04:54:35,350
Go, Alexander, go!

6890
04:54:35,350 --> 04:54:37,070
How is this tiny...

6891
04:54:37,070 --> 04:54:39,610
This tiny horse is carrying this entire game.

6892
04:54:39,830 --> 04:54:40,710
That's for sure.

6893
04:54:41,210 --> 04:54:43,250
This tiny horse is doing it all.

6894
04:54:44,210 --> 04:54:45,570
Gravity magic.

6895
04:54:46,670 --> 04:54:47,730
Holy fuck!

6896
04:54:48,390 --> 04:54:49,890
Go, tiny horse, go!

6897
04:54:50,370 --> 04:54:51,130
Look at him!

6898
04:54:51,450 --> 04:54:52,610
Please, help him!

6899
04:54:52,910 --> 04:54:54,030
He's a tiny horse!

6900
04:54:54,370 --> 04:54:55,950
Please, free this horse!

6901
04:54:59,630 --> 04:55:01,390
Oh my god!

6902
04:55:01,850 --> 04:55:04,110
Two people died already!

6903
04:55:04,110 --> 04:55:05,410
So what?

6904
04:55:05,450 --> 04:55:06,050
Alexander!

6905
04:55:06,570 --> 04:55:06,830
No!

6906
04:55:13,370 --> 04:55:14,250
No!

6907
04:55:17,820 --> 04:55:18,880
He died.

6908
04:55:21,120 --> 04:55:23,100
Bro, what the fuck?

6909
04:55:30,440 --> 04:55:31,060
Legit!

6910
04:55:31,620 --> 04:55:32,060
No!

6911
04:55:32,740 --> 04:55:34,480
All my friends are dead!

6912
04:55:35,000 --> 04:55:36,080
One more friend.

6913
04:55:36,300 --> 04:55:36,980
One more friend.

6914
04:55:36,980 --> 04:55:38,620
I've got one more friend in.

6915
04:55:38,920 --> 04:55:39,920
It's not over!

6916
04:55:40,080 --> 04:55:40,600
I hear no...

6917
04:55:40,600 --> 04:55:41,680
I hear no bell!

6918
04:55:42,160 --> 04:55:42,640
I...

6919
04:55:42,640 --> 04:55:44,080
It might be over!

6920
04:55:44,860 --> 04:55:45,340
Oh!

6921
04:55:45,540 --> 04:55:46,620
It might be over!

6922
04:55:46,980 --> 04:55:47,460
Please!

6923
04:55:47,780 --> 04:55:49,460
I wanna be a boss too!

6924
04:55:59,060 --> 04:55:59,700
Alexander!

6925
04:56:00,400 --> 04:56:00,480
No!

6926
04:56:01,200 --> 04:56:01,720
No!

6927
04:56:03,080 --> 04:56:03,720
No...

6928
04:56:03,720 --> 04:56:06,840
Okay, well now I know.

6929
04:56:07,080 --> 04:56:08,380
Now I know what to do.

6930
04:56:11,180 --> 04:56:12,940
I know what to do now.

6931
04:56:13,240 --> 04:56:14,220
There was...

6932
04:56:14,220 --> 04:56:15,000
Sorry I lied.

6933
04:56:15,260 --> 04:56:16,100
There was a bell.

6934
04:56:16,360 --> 04:56:18,660
There was a bell.

6935
04:56:18,660 --> 04:56:20,640
There's the belt.

6936
04:56:20,940 --> 04:56:22,260
There it is.

6937
04:56:22,960 --> 04:56:24,680
Alexander Hamilton.

6938
04:56:27,680 --> 04:56:30,260
He didn't feel anything.

6939
04:56:31,100 --> 04:56:33,460
Look, I was going through a lot, okay?

6940
04:56:34,460 --> 04:56:37,200
Like, that shit was crazy.

6941
04:56:40,060 --> 04:56:42,000
Oh my god!

6942
04:56:43,140 --> 04:56:45,960
The first mission is to...

6943
04:56:45,960 --> 04:56:47,960
Oh my god!

6944
04:56:50,960 --> 04:56:54,240
The first mission is to get over there first.

6945
04:57:00,790 --> 04:57:04,690
Let's try to summon as much as I can right now.

6946
04:57:05,810 --> 04:57:07,490
I'm trying so hard to summon.

6947
04:57:10,390 --> 04:57:10,950
Torrin!

6948
04:57:10,950 --> 04:57:12,430
Torrin's not going to make it.

6949
04:57:12,930 --> 04:57:15,290
Alright guys, I don't think he's going to make it, guys.

6950
04:57:15,470 --> 04:57:16,650
I don't want to make it.

6951
04:57:16,650 --> 04:57:17,930
We have one more!

6952
04:57:18,150 --> 04:57:19,270
One more summon!

6953
04:57:21,110 --> 04:57:22,430
It's the festival!

6954
04:57:24,050 --> 04:57:25,070
Alright, I'm ready.

6955
04:57:25,850 --> 04:57:27,010
I'm so ready.

6956
04:57:31,100 --> 04:57:32,300
Oh my god!

6957
04:57:33,440 --> 04:57:35,400
Guys, I'm not... I don't think I'm ready.

6958
04:57:39,970 --> 04:57:41,110
Holy shit!

6959
04:57:41,370 --> 04:57:42,790
Holy shit!

6960
04:57:46,650 --> 04:57:47,830
Oh my god!

6961
04:57:47,950 --> 04:57:49,110
How did he die already?

6962
04:57:49,570 --> 04:57:50,910
How did he die?

6963
04:57:52,690 --> 04:57:55,010
Please, I can't get close to him!

6964
04:57:55,010 --> 04:57:55,690
He's so far!

6965
04:57:56,930 --> 04:57:58,250
He's so far!

6966
04:58:01,720 --> 04:58:02,440
Okay.

6967
04:58:03,160 --> 04:58:04,420
Nice, I got out.

6968
04:58:05,480 --> 04:58:06,060
And

6969
04:58:11,940 --> 04:58:12,940
yes, let's go!

6970
04:58:13,660 --> 04:58:14,760
Keep whaling him!

6971
04:58:17,300 --> 04:58:18,820
Keep whaling him!

6972
04:58:20,220 --> 04:58:21,580
Oh my god, where did he go?

6973
04:58:22,260 --> 04:58:23,580
He just disappeared!

6974
04:58:24,080 --> 04:58:25,340
Guys, did we do it?

6975
04:58:25,760 --> 04:58:27,280
Guys, I think we did it!

6976
04:58:28,200 --> 04:58:28,600
Guys!

6977
04:58:44,080 --> 04:58:48,880
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH I understand how the dinosaurs went extinct, chat.

6978
04:58:49,300 --> 04:58:50,060
I...

6979
04:58:50,060 --> 04:58:52,100
I understand now.

6980
04:58:52,730 --> 04:58:53,900
Guys, I...

6981
04:58:53,900 --> 04:58:58,640
I understand why the dinosaurs died from a rock.

6982
04:58:58,880 --> 04:59:00,120
I get it now.

6983
04:59:00,120 --> 04:59:01,020
I...

6984
04:59:01,020 --> 04:59:01,980
I...

6985
04:59:03,180 --> 04:59:03,800
I...

6986
04:59:03,800 --> 04:59:06,520
Thank you for the super chat.

6987
04:59:06,780 --> 04:59:08,200
Thank you, thank you.

6988
04:59:08,860 --> 04:59:09,480
I...

6989
04:59:09,480 --> 04:59:10,640
I get it.

6990
04:59:11,000 --> 04:59:12,640
I understand.

6991
04:59:18,480 --> 04:59:19,100
Okay.

6992
04:59:21,100 --> 04:59:23,420
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

6993
04:59:24,460 --> 04:59:25,720
Oh my god.

6994
04:59:25,720 --> 04:59:29,300
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

6995
04:59:29,960 --> 04:59:33,840
Dinosaur never... was not ready for phase two.

6996
04:59:34,280 --> 04:59:36,500
They were never ready for it.

6997
04:59:47,220 --> 04:59:54,340
Oh my god.

6998
04:59:57,000 --> 05:00:00,060
I just thought he would magically teleport.

6999
05:00:00,580 --> 05:00:04,460
I didn't think he was gonna summon the next fucking meteor.

7000
05:00:05,140 --> 05:00:08,600
I just thought I'll be like, ah yes, let me just wait here.

7001
05:00:08,780 --> 05:00:10,740
Let me just wait here for him.

7002
05:00:21,220 --> 05:00:23,720
Oh my god, I wrote it.

7003
05:00:26,820 --> 05:00:28,860
Oh god, oh god.

7004
05:00:32,680 --> 05:00:35,960
Oh my god, please, I'm trying to summon this guy.

7005
05:00:36,420 --> 05:00:39,660
Please, I'm trying to summon Alexander right now.

7006
05:00:43,660 --> 05:00:47,480
Oh my god, oh my god.

7007
05:00:51,470 --> 05:00:53,790
Holy fuck, there's one more that I have to summon.

7008
05:00:54,190 --> 05:00:55,970
She's literally right there.

7009
05:01:05,580 --> 05:01:06,520
Okay, it's fine.

7010
05:01:07,580 --> 05:01:10,640
It's not fine, but like, I'm coping right now.

7011
05:01:10,780 --> 05:01:11,800
I'm actually coping.

7012
05:01:12,000 --> 05:01:13,260
I'm coping so hard.

7013
05:01:13,640 --> 05:01:16,080
I'm coping so hard.

7014
05:01:16,360 --> 05:01:18,400
I do not feel fine.

7015
05:01:23,740 --> 05:01:24,500
Okay.

7016
05:01:29,520 --> 05:01:30,720
Oh my god.

7017
05:01:30,880 --> 05:01:31,040
Oh my god, please.

7018
05:01:31,500 --> 05:01:32,920
Somebody save this horse.

7019
05:01:33,200 --> 05:01:34,740
He does not deserve this.

7020
05:01:35,120 --> 05:01:35,580
He...

7021
05:01:35,580 --> 05:01:37,280
Somebody please.

7022
05:01:39,280 --> 05:01:41,540
Somebody please save this horse.

7023
05:01:43,900 --> 05:01:45,520
Let him rest.

7024
05:01:45,880 --> 05:01:47,640
This horse needs rest.

7025
05:01:52,450 --> 05:01:53,510
Oh my god.

7026
05:01:53,690 --> 05:01:53,730
Oh my god.

7027
05:01:53,730 --> 05:01:55,310
I didn't realize they can body block.

7028
05:01:55,530 --> 05:01:57,170
Are you fucking kidding me?

7029
05:02:04,260 --> 05:02:05,020
Oh my god.

7030
05:02:06,080 --> 05:02:10,000
Oh my god.

7031
05:02:10,080 --> 05:02:10,980
Oh my god.

7032
05:02:11,200 --> 05:02:11,260
Okay.

7033
05:02:12,540 --> 05:02:13,200
Thank you.

7034
05:02:13,580 --> 05:02:14,320
Thank you for the heals.

7035
05:02:14,560 --> 05:02:15,240
Oh my god.

7036
05:02:23,580 --> 05:02:24,860
I'm alive.

7037
05:02:26,180 --> 05:02:27,460
I'm alive.

7038
05:02:27,800 --> 05:02:28,600
How?

7039
05:02:28,940 --> 05:02:30,260
It's a miracle.

7040
05:02:33,160 --> 05:02:34,260
What's that?

7041
05:02:34,520 --> 05:02:35,340
What's that?

7042
05:02:35,420 --> 05:02:37,760
He can summon multiple meteors now?

7043
05:02:47,800 --> 05:02:48,720
Holy

7044
05:02:52,200 --> 05:02:53,120
shit.

7045
05:02:54,180 --> 05:02:57,260
What do you mean there's multiple meteors?

7046
05:03:01,590 --> 05:03:02,510
No.

7047
05:03:03,130 --> 05:03:03,750
Doreen.

7048
05:03:03,910 --> 05:03:04,390
Please.

7049
05:03:04,670 --> 05:03:05,510
Message appraise.

7050
05:03:06,350 --> 05:03:07,150
Okay.

7051
05:03:07,650 --> 05:03:07,950
Okay.

7052
05:03:08,410 --> 05:03:08,770
Okay.

7053
05:03:09,130 --> 05:03:09,610
Okay.

7054
05:03:10,190 --> 05:03:10,850
It's fine.

7055
05:03:11,410 --> 05:03:12,750
We're gonna bring them back.

7056
05:03:15,250 --> 05:03:16,670
Bring it back, Alexander!

7057
05:03:17,030 --> 05:03:18,070
Get back in there!

7058
05:03:18,310 --> 05:03:19,610
I hear no bell!

7059
05:03:20,850 --> 05:03:21,590
Oh, no.

7060
05:03:21,830 --> 05:03:22,430
Oh, no.

7061
05:03:22,570 --> 05:03:22,930
It's fine.

7062
05:03:23,190 --> 05:03:23,870
It's fine.

7063
05:03:26,770 --> 05:03:27,590
It's fine.

7064
05:03:27,910 --> 05:03:28,710
They're back in it.

7065
05:03:30,370 --> 05:03:32,070
It's like they never died.

7066
05:03:32,990 --> 05:03:33,350
Oh, God.

7067
05:03:33,650 --> 05:03:34,350
Oh, God.

7068
05:03:35,090 --> 05:03:35,930
Oh, God.

7069
05:03:39,310 --> 05:03:40,130
Oh, God.

7070
05:03:40,510 --> 05:03:41,790
Oh, my God.

7071
05:03:54,150 --> 05:03:55,210
Oh,

7072
05:04:00,320 --> 05:04:02,100
my God.

7073
05:04:02,700 --> 05:04:04,760
Oh, my God.

7074
05:04:05,380 --> 05:04:09,260
I turned my back on him and I got meteored.

7075
05:04:11,180 --> 05:04:13,480
Never look away.

7076
05:04:14,300 --> 05:04:16,160
Holy fuck.

7077
05:04:16,940 --> 05:04:20,280
I didn't realize it was too wet.

7078
05:04:20,280 --> 05:04:24,020
I... I wanted to grab more summons.

7079
05:04:29,790 --> 05:04:33,830
I just... I just want to grab the homies.

7080
05:04:34,310 --> 05:04:35,370
That's it.

7081
05:04:39,330 --> 05:04:42,510
Let me just eat everything, guys.

7082
05:04:43,550 --> 05:04:47,550
Oh, my God.

7083
05:04:49,350 --> 05:04:50,130
Don't worry.

7084
05:04:50,290 --> 05:04:52,710
I'll make it there eventually, guys.

7085
05:04:53,410 --> 05:04:53,850
Oh, my God.

7086
05:04:53,970 --> 05:04:54,570
There's the last one.

7087
05:04:55,230 --> 05:04:55,710
Okay.

7088
05:04:56,070 --> 05:04:56,410
Oh!

7089
05:04:58,150 --> 05:04:59,410
I got the healer, though.

7090
05:04:59,650 --> 05:05:00,650
I got the healer.

7091
05:05:00,790 --> 05:05:01,590
The healer.

7092
05:05:01,690 --> 05:05:02,010
No!

7093
05:05:02,330 --> 05:05:02,850
Heal me!

7094
05:05:03,190 --> 05:05:03,910
Heal me!

7095
05:05:03,930 --> 05:05:05,030
Heal me, healer!

7096
05:05:05,190 --> 05:05:05,950
Heal me, please!

7097
05:05:05,950 --> 05:05:06,890
Thank you.

7098
05:05:07,090 --> 05:05:07,290
Thank you.

7099
05:05:07,350 --> 05:05:07,950
Thank you for the appraisals.

7100
05:05:09,990 --> 05:05:10,930
Thank you, guys.

7101
05:05:12,310 --> 05:05:13,790
I really appreciate that.

7102
05:05:14,350 --> 05:05:14,950
It really do.

7103
05:05:15,230 --> 05:05:16,710
It really helps a lot.

7104
05:05:21,940 --> 05:05:23,940
How is this the nerf version?

7105
05:05:24,360 --> 05:05:26,460
What kind of hell am I in?

7106
05:05:26,760 --> 05:05:28,260
Oh, my God.

7107
05:05:31,360 --> 05:05:32,880
This poor horse.

7108
05:05:33,820 --> 05:05:35,760
This actual poor horse.

7109
05:05:36,060 --> 05:05:38,580
This poor horse.

7110
05:05:39,540 --> 05:05:40,940
Holy shit.

7111
05:05:44,690 --> 05:05:45,390
Oh,

7112
05:05:52,080 --> 05:05:52,360
my God.

7113
05:05:52,540 --> 05:05:53,340
Someone already died.

7114
05:05:53,700 --> 05:05:54,620
I don't know how.

7115
05:05:55,620 --> 05:05:57,140
But someone's already dead.

7116
05:06:00,320 --> 05:06:01,120
Don't worry.

7117
05:06:01,180 --> 05:06:01,820
I got you.

7118
05:06:10,600 --> 05:06:12,400
I mean to me or me, no, I've got him.

7119
05:06:12,680 --> 05:06:14,260
Guys, I don't think I got him, guys.

7120
05:06:15,560 --> 05:06:17,300
I don't think I got him.

7121
05:06:17,580 --> 05:06:19,600
I don't think I got him.

7122
05:06:19,800 --> 05:06:23,520
Oh, my God.

7123
05:06:26,140 --> 05:06:27,200
Oh, my God.

7124
05:06:27,340 --> 05:06:28,400
I'm just...

7125
05:06:28,400 --> 05:06:29,920
This is my worst run yet.

7126
05:06:29,920 --> 05:06:35,460
This is actually my worst run so far.

7127
05:06:36,600 --> 05:06:37,860
Holy fuck.

7128
05:06:38,240 --> 05:06:39,580
Oh, my God.

7129
05:06:40,500 --> 05:06:41,680
It's everywhere.

7130
05:06:42,940 --> 05:06:43,680
It's...

7131
05:06:43,680 --> 05:06:45,940
It's actually everywhere.

7132
05:06:51,380 --> 05:06:53,020
Holy fuck.

7133
05:06:54,180 --> 05:06:55,160
I just...

7134
05:06:55,160 --> 05:06:57,440
I just ate all the hits possible.

7135
05:06:57,760 --> 05:06:58,020
I...

7136
05:06:58,020 --> 05:06:59,760
I don't know how I did that.

7137
05:07:00,520 --> 05:07:01,080
I...

7138
05:07:01,080 --> 05:07:03,800
Everything just hit me all at once.

7139
05:07:04,280 --> 05:07:04,760
I hit...

7140
05:07:04,760 --> 05:07:07,020
I just rolled into every single attack there.

7141
05:07:07,260 --> 05:07:10,520
I'm just here to test out my appraisals at this point.

7142
05:07:13,120 --> 05:07:14,620
Message was appraised.

7143
05:07:25,530 --> 05:07:25,930
Okay.

7144
05:07:30,030 --> 05:07:30,730
Oh, my God.

7145
05:07:30,790 --> 05:07:31,330
I'm too scared.

7146
05:07:33,650 --> 05:07:34,730
Get back and get it on.

7147
05:07:34,910 --> 05:07:36,250
Oh, I can get on the horse now.

7148
05:07:36,670 --> 05:07:37,090
Thank God.

7149
05:07:39,210 --> 05:07:39,870
Thank God.

7150
05:07:40,470 --> 05:07:40,990
Grab him.

7151
05:07:41,190 --> 05:07:41,530
Grab him.

7152
05:07:41,690 --> 05:07:42,050
Grab him.

7153
05:07:49,950 --> 05:07:51,330
Get over here.

7154
05:07:51,390 --> 05:07:52,030
Get over here.

7155
05:07:52,070 --> 05:07:52,690
Get over here.

7156
05:07:52,990 --> 05:07:53,330
Leave.

7157
05:07:53,630 --> 05:07:53,950
Leave.

7158
05:07:54,350 --> 05:07:55,450
Wait until they're all here.

7159
05:07:55,930 --> 05:07:57,290
Wait until the crew's here.

7160
05:07:58,130 --> 05:07:59,710
I'm waiting for the crew.

7161
05:08:00,690 --> 05:08:02,630
The crew won't show up.

7162
05:08:04,750 --> 05:08:06,030
Oh, thank God.

7163
05:08:06,550 --> 05:08:07,350
They're here.

7164
05:08:08,090 --> 05:08:09,550
The crew's here.

7165
05:08:11,450 --> 05:08:12,670
And then I missed.

7166
05:08:12,670 --> 05:08:13,390
Okay, that's cool.

7167
05:08:13,610 --> 05:08:14,370
That's cool.

7168
05:08:14,590 --> 05:08:15,130
That's all right.

7169
05:08:15,450 --> 05:08:16,330
That's all right.

7170
05:08:17,790 --> 05:08:18,450
All right.

7171
05:08:18,870 --> 05:08:20,330
That sounds about right.

7172
05:08:20,890 --> 05:08:21,450
That's...

7173
05:08:21,450 --> 05:08:24,930
That sounds about right.

7174
05:08:25,910 --> 05:08:26,550
Don't worry.

7175
05:08:26,870 --> 05:08:27,870
I'll hit it event...

7176
05:08:27,870 --> 05:08:29,290
I'll hit them eventually, guys.

7177
05:08:31,070 --> 05:08:31,630
Okay.

7178
05:08:31,910 --> 05:08:33,490
I do have to say...

7179
05:08:33,490 --> 05:08:36,930
The fucking cape is so disorienting sometimes.

7180
05:08:37,850 --> 05:08:38,410
But...

7181
05:08:39,570 --> 05:08:42,170
But it's so hard to hit the cape sometimes.

7182
05:08:42,170 --> 05:08:43,490
Okay, I will say that.

7183
05:08:43,610 --> 05:08:44,530
I will say that.

7184
05:08:45,030 --> 05:08:47,630
The cape, like, blocked everything for me.

7185
05:08:54,110 --> 05:08:54,890
Oh my god.

7186
05:08:55,010 --> 05:08:55,530
Oh my god.

7187
05:08:56,350 --> 05:08:56,990
Oh no.

7188
05:08:58,150 --> 05:08:58,910
It's the meteor.

7189
05:08:59,270 --> 05:09:00,150
It's the meteor.

7190
05:09:01,230 --> 05:09:02,490
It's the fucking meteor.

7191
05:09:04,010 --> 05:09:04,490
Please.

7192
05:09:04,790 --> 05:09:05,150
Please.

7193
05:09:05,490 --> 05:09:05,770
Please.

7194
05:09:06,050 --> 05:09:06,510
Not me.

7195
05:09:06,690 --> 05:09:07,190
Not me.

7196
05:09:07,650 --> 05:09:08,170
Oh, not me.

7197
05:09:08,290 --> 05:09:08,670
Thank god.

7198
05:09:10,270 --> 05:09:11,390
Thank god, not me.

7199
05:09:14,980 --> 05:09:16,920
Oh no, not me.

7200
05:09:19,510 --> 05:09:22,450
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

7201
05:09:26,420 --> 05:09:27,020
Okay.

7202
05:09:34,340 --> 05:09:34,940
Jesus.

7203
05:09:34,940 --> 05:09:36,100
Jesus Christ.

7204
05:09:37,660 --> 05:09:38,260
Okay.

7205
05:09:43,290 --> 05:09:43,890
Oh!

7206
05:09:47,030 --> 05:09:47,630
Oh!

7207
05:09:50,190 --> 05:09:51,510
Oh fuck, guys.

7208
05:09:53,990 --> 05:09:54,930
I'm scared.

7209
05:09:55,210 --> 05:09:56,370
I'm too scared to turn my...

7210
05:09:56,370 --> 05:09:57,170
I'm too scared to turn my back on him.

7211
05:09:57,710 --> 05:09:58,590
I wanna...

7212
05:09:58,590 --> 05:09:58,930
Woo!

7213
05:10:00,730 --> 05:10:01,210
Woo!

7214
05:10:14,410 --> 05:10:15,910
Oh my god, where am I?

7215
05:10:16,250 --> 05:10:17,170
Where am I?

7216
05:10:17,410 --> 05:10:18,350
I don't...

7217
05:10:18,350 --> 05:10:18,570
RACE!

7218
05:10:18,830 --> 05:10:19,270
Guys, guys!

7219
05:10:19,510 --> 05:10:20,450
Message and praise, please!

7220
05:10:27,760 --> 05:10:28,640
Oh my god.

7221
05:10:34,030 --> 05:10:35,030
Oh, thank god.

7222
05:10:35,610 --> 05:10:36,510
It went for him.

7223
05:10:36,510 --> 05:10:38,250
Oh my god.

7224
05:10:39,790 --> 05:10:40,590
Oh my god!

7225
05:10:40,810 --> 05:10:41,610
Why?!

7226
05:10:53,790 --> 05:10:55,610
Oh my god!

7227
05:10:59,220 --> 05:10:59,740
Please.

7228
05:11:00,320 --> 05:11:01,060
Holy shit!

7229
05:11:04,510 --> 05:11:05,490
It's okay.

7230
05:11:05,850 --> 05:11:07,190
He's taking it all.

7231
05:11:09,810 --> 05:11:11,030
Oh my god.

7232
05:11:11,190 --> 05:11:12,250
I'm taking it all.

7233
05:11:15,390 --> 05:11:16,350
Oh!

7234
05:11:16,350 --> 05:11:16,930
Oh!

7235
05:11:20,140 --> 05:11:21,100
Jesus!

7236
05:11:27,520 --> 05:11:28,480
Please!

7237
05:11:28,800 --> 05:11:29,180
Yes!

7238
05:11:29,740 --> 05:11:37,080
Oh my god!

7239
05:11:37,420 --> 05:11:39,000
Me and the wolfman!

7240
05:11:39,280 --> 05:11:42,180
We were... He died for my sins!

7241
05:11:42,640 --> 05:11:45,640
He actually died for my sins!

7242
05:11:46,300 --> 05:11:47,180
Oh my god!

7243
05:11:48,540 --> 05:11:49,440
Thank god!

7244
05:11:55,180 --> 05:11:59,140
Now look at the beautiful stars.

7245
05:11:59,540 --> 05:12:02,340
As I'm surrounded by my dead friends.

7246
05:12:08,840 --> 05:12:11,000
What happened?

7247
05:12:17,550 --> 05:12:18,850
I earned this.

7248
05:12:21,590 --> 05:12:22,170
Oh!

7249
05:12:34,070 --> 05:12:36,130
A red mark was made on the map.

7250
05:12:36,310 --> 05:12:37,170
I did it, guys!

7251
05:12:38,930 --> 05:12:40,030
I'm a hero!

7252
05:12:41,950 --> 05:12:45,750
Ray was holding all those stars while fighting you by the way!

7253
05:12:45,750 --> 05:12:48,210
What the fuck was he doing with all those stars?

7254
05:12:49,930 --> 05:12:51,870
I'm gonna have to seek water side.

7255
05:12:52,450 --> 05:12:52,930
Okay.

7256
05:12:53,190 --> 05:12:54,710
No, we don't need this right now.

7257
05:12:55,030 --> 05:12:58,850
Trace meters, gravity magic, big blades, doki strength, praise...

7258
05:12:59,650 --> 05:13:00,870
J.J.K.

7259
05:13:01,330 --> 05:13:01,810
Jumping.

7260
05:13:03,210 --> 05:13:04,610
What a sick way to...

7261
05:13:04,610 --> 05:13:05,390
Oh, you're alive!

7262
05:13:06,470 --> 05:13:07,990
The glory of the class is shared...

7263
05:13:08,970 --> 05:13:09,930
...by Radan...

7264
05:13:09,930 --> 05:13:10,910
...and you...

7265
05:13:10,910 --> 05:13:12,830
...and then a falling star...

7266
05:13:13,410 --> 05:13:14,710
...right before our eyes.

7267
05:13:14,950 --> 05:13:15,110
Oh!

7268
05:13:15,330 --> 05:13:17,510
I can't find them how Radan was holding back something...

7269
05:13:17,510 --> 05:13:17,690
...if that's...

7270
05:13:17,690 --> 05:13:17,990
Yeah!

7271
05:13:18,350 --> 05:13:19,590
Oh yeah, he was holding the stars!

7272
05:13:19,590 --> 05:13:20,910
Oh, there's less stars now!

7273
05:13:27,670 --> 05:13:30,310
Oh no, now we're gonna be invaded by aliens!

7274
05:13:31,350 --> 05:13:32,910
He was holding the aliens back!

7275
05:13:35,350 --> 05:13:35,630
Yay!

7276
05:13:36,130 --> 05:13:36,710
That's me!

7277
05:13:37,330 --> 05:13:38,310
That's me, guys!

7278
05:13:38,310 --> 05:13:39,050
I did it!

7279
05:13:39,650 --> 05:13:40,930
I did it, everyone!

7280
05:13:41,890 --> 05:13:43,390
Alright, time to...

7281
05:13:43,390 --> 05:13:45,830
Time to level these up...

7282
05:13:45,830 --> 05:13:47,070
...to like 40, right?

7283
05:13:47,290 --> 05:13:48,690
Am I doing it all the way to 40?

7284
05:13:50,290 --> 05:13:51,470
Or do I...

7285
05:13:55,860 --> 05:13:57,340
Or do I do like...

7286
05:13:57,340 --> 05:13:57,880
...one...

7287
05:13:58,400 --> 05:13:58,880
...dexterity?

7288
05:13:59,140 --> 05:13:59,860
Or two?

7289
05:14:04,680 --> 05:14:07,500
Alright, I'll put one in dexterity before I put...

7290
05:14:07,500 --> 05:14:08,120
...put it on.

7291
05:14:08,700 --> 05:14:09,860
Alright, here we go.

7292
05:14:11,220 --> 05:14:12,800
Alright, let's call it here.

7293
05:14:13,160 --> 05:14:13,580
I'm...

7294
05:14:14,820 --> 05:14:16,360
We made a lot of progress.

7295
05:14:16,660 --> 05:14:17,580
Let's call it here.

7296
05:14:17,820 --> 05:14:19,620
I'm... I'm okay with calling it...

7297
05:14:19,620 --> 05:14:20,640
...with calling it here.

7298
05:14:20,760 --> 05:14:22,020
We got a story boss down.

7299
05:14:22,340 --> 05:14:22,640
Alright.

7300
05:14:25,840 --> 05:14:27,240
Oh my god.

7301
05:14:27,720 --> 05:14:28,860
But yeah, that was fun.

7302
05:14:29,800 --> 05:14:30,800
Thank God...

7303
05:14:30,800 --> 05:14:31,540
Thank God...

7304
05:14:31,540 --> 05:14:33,320
The message of praise...

7305
05:14:33,320 --> 05:14:36,260
...as prop took me to the end there.

7306
05:14:37,260 --> 05:14:37,700
But...

7307
05:14:37,700 --> 05:14:40,180
Tomorrow in the morning to wake up super early for...

7308
05:14:40,180 --> 05:14:42,960
...the panel and the Artist Alley tour.

7309
05:14:43,540 --> 05:14:44,020
So...

7310
05:14:44,020 --> 05:14:44,260
Wow!

7311
05:14:44,460 --> 05:14:45,760
And I have so much work to do tonight.

7312
05:14:45,980 --> 05:14:46,460
Um...

7313
05:14:46,460 --> 05:14:48,500
But I won't be streaming until Wednesday.

7314
05:14:48,980 --> 05:14:49,420
So...

7315
05:14:49,960 --> 05:14:51,360
I'll be taking...

7316
05:14:51,780 --> 05:14:54,020
...Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday off...

7317
05:14:54,020 --> 05:14:54,800
...to recuperate.

7318
05:14:54,960 --> 05:14:57,220
And if I still have a brain fog...

7319
05:14:57,220 --> 05:14:57,940
...um...

7320
05:14:57,940 --> 05:14:58,520
...during...

7321
05:14:58,520 --> 05:14:59,440
...the week...

7322
05:14:59,440 --> 05:15:00,380
...during that week...

7323
05:15:00,380 --> 05:15:00,940
...um...

7324
05:15:00,940 --> 05:15:02,320
...I'm gonna do it again...

7325
05:15:02,320 --> 05:15:02,740
...next week...

7326
05:15:02,740 --> 05:15:03,740
...for Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday.

7327
05:15:04,060 --> 05:15:04,520
So like...

7328
05:15:04,520 --> 05:15:05,680
...if I still have brain fog...

7329
05:15:05,680 --> 05:15:07,200
...I'll continue to like...

7330
05:15:07,200 --> 05:15:07,680
...uh...

7331
05:15:07,680 --> 05:15:08,360
...like...

7332
05:15:08,360 --> 05:15:09,960
...rest a little bit more...

7333
05:15:09,960 --> 05:15:10,800
...until like...

7334
05:15:10,800 --> 05:15:11,560
...the brain fog leaves.

7335
05:15:11,680 --> 05:15:12,660
Because I'm like...

7336
05:15:12,660 --> 05:15:13,160
...my...

7337
05:15:14,300 --> 05:15:15,260
...thought process...

7338
05:15:15,260 --> 05:15:16,620
...is lagging a lot more.

7339
05:15:16,880 --> 05:15:17,500
Because usually like...

7340
05:15:17,500 --> 05:15:18,160
...when I talk...

7341
05:15:18,160 --> 05:15:18,900
...or when I yap...

7342
05:15:18,900 --> 05:15:20,060
...it's much more fluid.

7343
05:15:20,400 --> 05:15:21,240
But lately...

7344
05:15:21,240 --> 05:15:22,660
...I can find myself like...

7345
05:15:22,660 --> 05:15:23,240
...stuttering.

7346
05:15:23,520 --> 05:15:23,720
Like...

7347
05:15:23,720 --> 05:15:24,860
...my brain is actually like...

7348
05:15:24,860 --> 05:15:25,300
...stuttering.

7349
05:15:26,540 --> 05:15:27,180
It's like...

7350
05:15:27,180 --> 05:15:28,000
...what do I say next?

7351
05:15:28,080 --> 05:15:28,480
I'm like...

7352
05:15:28,480 --> 05:15:30,020
...this never happened before, Toki!

7353
05:15:30,120 --> 05:15:31,940
You've been streaming for how long?

7354
05:15:34,340 --> 05:15:35,600
Yeah, even now...

7355
05:15:35,600 --> 05:15:36,920
...I was lagging a little bit.

7356
05:15:36,980 --> 05:15:37,660
Because I was like...

7357
05:15:37,660 --> 05:15:38,140
...what do I...

7358
05:15:38,140 --> 05:15:39,200
...how do I say this?

7359
05:15:39,240 --> 05:15:40,140
What's that word again?

7360
05:15:40,760 --> 05:15:41,240
Um...

7361
05:15:41,240 --> 05:15:41,740
But yeah...

7362
05:15:41,740 --> 05:15:42,580
...thank you all for coming!

7363
05:15:42,960 --> 05:15:44,060
As always...

7364
05:15:44,060 --> 05:15:44,860
...everybody...

7365
05:15:44,860 --> 05:15:45,720
...stay hydrated.

7366
05:15:46,080 --> 05:15:46,700
Posture check.

7367
05:15:46,940 --> 05:15:47,820
Get up and move around.

7368
05:15:47,960 --> 05:15:48,880
Get that blood flowing.

7369
05:15:49,060 --> 05:15:49,440
And if you...

7370
05:15:49,440 --> 05:15:50,220
...stay up for me...

7371
05:15:50,220 --> 05:15:50,980
...head to bed.

7372
05:15:51,080 --> 05:15:51,540
Cause...

7373
05:15:51,540 --> 05:15:52,440
...you deserve it!

7374
05:15:52,620 --> 05:15:54,160
I'll see you guys next time everybody!

7375
05:15:54,760 --> 05:15:55,640
Bye guys!

7376
05:15:56,640 --> 05:15:57,120
Bye!
