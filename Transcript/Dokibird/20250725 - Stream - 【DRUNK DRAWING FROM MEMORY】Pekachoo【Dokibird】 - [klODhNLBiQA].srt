1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
Yeah, technology these days.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,080
Did you show your chat?

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,580
The tomato foogie?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,780
Yeah, I was drawing it before.

5
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:09,300
Okay, wait, I need to show it.

6
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,160
Let's just take a welcoming shot, you know?

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,260
Get it out of the way.

8
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:15,140
What are you drinking?

9
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,480
I'm drinking sparkling sake.

10
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:18,180
What are you drinking?

11
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,720
Okay, I'm drinking a hard iced tea.

12
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,700
I was gonna buy soju, but I didn't have time.

13
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,020
Bye-bye.

14
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,820
Hard iced tea.

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,280
What is the percentage of that?

16
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,960
Okay, it's like...

17
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,140
Oh my gosh, what is the percentage of it?

18
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,340
Okay, there's vodka in here though, so...

19
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:38,640
Ooh!

20
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,920
It's hard, hard.

21
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,160
That's hard.

22
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,440
That's really hard.

23
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,320
Yeah, that's how hard it is.

24
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,160
It's 5%.

25
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:45,340
Okay, tears!

26
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:46,380
It's...

27
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,400
By the way, it's so hard.

28
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,960
It's only 5%.

29
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,700
5%?

30
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,220
Okay, mine is...

31
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,320
What is this?

32
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,260
Oh, this is delicious.

33
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,560
What the heck?

34
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,080
Oh, Lily is loud?

35
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,820
Okay, let me turn you down a little bit.

36
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,640
You are quiet for me.

37
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,420
I have you at 200%.

38
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:07,620
Ooh...

39
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,740
Maybe... okay.

40
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,800
Actually, I think it's okay.

41
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,000
Chat by the chat.

42
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,440
Oh yeah, I can turn myself up a little bit.

43
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:16,960
And...

44
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,120
It's okay now.

45
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:19,420
Okay.

46
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:19,780
Yeah, okay.

47
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,260
Alright, I turned Lily down a little bit too, on my end.

48
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,480
But hello everybody!

49
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,240
Sorry, we didn't really have an intro.

50
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:26,880
We just went...

51
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,120
We just got in the call.

52
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:30,980
But hello guys.

53
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,600
It's me at DokiBird.

54
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,540
And then we have here... I mean...

55
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:37,000
Well, people on Lily's channel will know who she is.

56
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,660
Uh...

57
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,020
I have Lily Piccio with me right now.

58
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,060
I like how you, like, take a shot, right?

59
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:47,640
Yeah.

60
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,540
That's good.

61
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,080
It's good.

62
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:50,400
It's good.

63
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:50,520
That's good.

64
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,220
Uh, we're gonna be...

65
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:52,820
Oh, sorry.

66
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:53,140
I'm so sorry.

67
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:53,540
No, wait, no.

68
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,280
You go.

69
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:54,500
You go.

70
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:54,780
You go.

71
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,060
Is your sparkling sake hitting hard now?

72
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,140
No, no.

73
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,740
Is it hitting?

74
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,520
No.

75
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:03,880
Let's...

76
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,760
Let's turn over.

77
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:05,280
Please.

78
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,220
Okay.

79
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:06,920
Hello, everyone.

80
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:07,980
My name is DokiBird.

81
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,080
I'm here with Lily Piccio.

82
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:10,520
Oh, yeah.

83
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,140
You're gonna stay.

84
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:11,560
Okay.

85
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,260
We're gonna draw stuff.

86
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:13,980
Oh, yeah.

87
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:14,400
Yeah.

88
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,440
It's gonna be great.

89
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,800
We're such professional...

90
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,540
We're such professionals.

91
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,780
We're gonna be drawing random characters from memory while drunk.

92
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,700
So, we'll see...

93
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,740
We'll see how...

94
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,920
How well it goes the longer we go.

95
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,580
We'll see how...

96
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,100
Yippee!

97
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:29,960
Yippee!

98
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,180
Oh, yeah.

99
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:31,980
I want...

100
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:32,340
Yeah.

101
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:32,720
I'm sorry.

102
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,540
No, you go first.

103
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,940
No, no, no, no, no, no.

104
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,020
You go first.

105
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:37,880
Wait.

106
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:38,820
How are we drawing?

107
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:39,420
Are we...

108
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:39,460
Okay.

109
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,660
Separate canvas or...

110
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,420
You know the canvas where we can draw together?

111
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,260
What are you thinking?

112
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:43,740
I feel...

113
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,320
No, I think it'll be funnier if we could surprise each other.

114
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,160
Okay.

115
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,280
Of what it would look.

116
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,020
And then we just send each other the picture.

117
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,440
And then we can just show it on stream.

118
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:58,160
In terms of like picking what we draw, I feel like each of us could pick from our own chats what they suggest.

119
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:04,920
And then like if we don't know it, we'll just have the chat describe or like we have each other describe it to the other person.

120
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,720
If we know what it is.

121
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,800
Oh, okay.

122
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,500
I caught the first three sentences.

123
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,960
I'm so sorry.

124
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,100
I'm so sorry.

125
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:14,880
I'm so sorry.

126
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,340
I'm sorry.

127
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:15,920
Okay.

128
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,060
So, this is how I think we could do it.

129
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:18,840
Okay.

130
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,080
We could do it where we...

131
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,600
Each of us take turns grabbing a suggestion from chat.

132
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:23,740
Yeah, yeah.

133
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,860
And then like if the other person doesn't know what the character is.

134
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,000
Oh, the chat describes it.

135
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,280
Yeah, the chat describes it.

136
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:30,980
I see.

137
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:31,640
We also...

138
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,460
Or if like we know what it is, we'll also describe it to each other.

139
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:35,680
Oh, one more.

140
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,220
One more question.

141
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,480
Are we doing the same thing then?

142
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:37,880
Yeah, yeah.

143
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,000
We're drawing the same thing.

144
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,420
And then we'll show each other the picture and be like...

145
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:42,640
Got it.

146
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,140
Yeah, yeah.

147
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:43,160
Yeah.

148
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:47,660
So, also for those who are wondering, they're like, oh, why this sudden collab?

149
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,380
Well, I was on Lily's podcast earlier this week.

150
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,500
Yeah, we did a VTuber episode.

151
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:53,900
Yeah.

152
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,580
Which was really cute actually.

153
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,840
I really liked it.

154
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,760
Yeah, I love how you made Kroki like transparent.

155
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,180
Oh, Kroki.

156
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,600
Okay.

157
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,240
She was very disappointed because I hyped Kroki up so much.

158
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,640
And then I couldn't get it to work.

159
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,960
All she saw was like, it was just like a static, not moving Kroki.

160
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,280
It was the most underwhelming thing I've ever seen in my life.

161
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,320
I'm like, this is okay.

162
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,160
Should I...

163
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,480
I'll be nice.

164
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,220
Yeah.

165
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,480
She's like, um...

166
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,100
Yeah, it looks...

167
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,920
Yeah, that's so...

168
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,100
That looks so good.

169
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:31,800
Okay.

170
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,260
I was like, no, I swear to God.

171
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,540
I swear to God, it's so much funnier when it can move.

172
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,380
No, no, I bet.

173
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,200
She did show me later and it was really cool.

174
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,560
Yeah, it was pretty funny.

175
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:44,300
But...

176
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,660
Before then, it was very whelming.

177
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:48,680
Uh...

178
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,940
Oh wait, I wanna show my chat...

179
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,980
Oh wait, let me show my chat to Fuki you drew.

180
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,320
Alright, let me...

181
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:53,820
Oh my gosh.

182
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,560
Wait, let me send you...

183
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,900
There's a talking version.

184
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,760
I don't know if that one's cute or...

185
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,980
Don't worry, I'll use this...

186
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,520
I'll use it one day in the...

187
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,700
I'll use it tomorrow, actually.

188
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,820
I'll use it...

189
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,880
I have a collab tomorrow, so I'll use this tomorrow.

190
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:08,860
Sorry, Pharrell.

191
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:09,840
Uh...

192
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,200
My...

193
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,660
One of my fan artists actually drew me a Fugi, too.

194
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,480
Like, this week.

195
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,600
Um...

196
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,320
Sorry, Pharrell.

197
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,120
We're using this tomato one tomorrow.

198
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,140
Uh...

199
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:22,820
I thought...

200
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,600
I didn't know the collab...

201
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,080
I...

202
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,800
It's my first one.

203
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:27,740
I've never tried it.

204
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,680
You've never done a VTuber collab before?

205
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,440
I guess whenever I play with other VTubers or whatever...

206
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,240
We just did Fugi.

207
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,820
I didn't know this was a thing in this...

208
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:36,760
Oh, now you...

209
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,120
Yeah.

210
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:37,900
Now you do.

211
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,740
You can, like...

212
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,840
Actually, you can, like, attach stuff onto...

213
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:41,600
Uh...

214
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,740
Onto, like, the other...

215
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:43,620
Uh...

216
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,300
Other, like, VTuber, too.

217
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,000
If you want.

218
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,080
I can control you.

219
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,000
Yeah, you can basically make me smaller, too.

220
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,760
If you want me to.

221
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,400
And you make me smaller, and then attach myself onto you.

222
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,920
So, like, when you're moving, I'll move, too.

223
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:57,780
Yeah.

224
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,420
Yeah, when you're AFK, I was smelling you.

225
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,020
No, I...

226
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:01,700
I...

227
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:06,240
I might have saw you, uh, trying to, like, kiss me, too, earlier.

228
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:06,600
I did.

229
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:06,980
I did.

230
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,840
I did do that, yeah.

231
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,500
I love the...

232
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,680
You were, like, AFK, the...

233
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:11,780
Oh, yeah.

234
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,740
The full circle loading thing.

235
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,280
That was cute.

236
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,320
Yeah, the buffering.

237
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,680
That's how I feel every day, to be fair.

238
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,840
Alright, let's...

239
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,840
Let's start draw...

240
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,240
Drink...

241
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,640
Drawing.

242
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,700
Oh, drinking or...

243
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,600
Oh, you can do both.

244
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:24,660
Okay.

245
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,260
Okay, I need my BGM to start.

246
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,960
Alright, I have my BGM playing now.

247
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,700
This is too delicious.

248
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,900
Why is it so good?

249
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,920
Wait, what flavor is it?

250
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,680
It's, like, sparkling peach.

251
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,400
It's just...

252
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,260
Sake.

253
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,920
That sounds nice.

254
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,940
It's a carbonated sake with peach flavors.

255
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,000
I really like it.

256
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,960
That sounds really nice.

257
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,660
Mine's just iced tea.

258
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,540
I could never drink, like, actual, like, hard liquor type drinks.

259
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,420
To be fair.

260
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,400
They're kind of disgusting and they smell and taste like nail polish.

261
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,000
I don't know how people can drink beer.

262
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:54,740
I'm sorry.

263
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:55,920
Beer is even worse.

264
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,260
I...

265
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,940
I'm sorry to all the beer lovers, but, like, I actually...

266
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,280
I cannot handle beer.

267
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,100
It's just...

268
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,760
I need something fruity, you know?

269
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,500
It sounds...

270
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,520
It looks good, though.

271
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,700
You know, like, the golden...

272
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,640
Oh, yeah, like...

273
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,060
Yeah, yeah.

274
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,460
The foam and everything.

275
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,240
Yeah.

276
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,380
The anime makes it look so delicious.

277
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,440
Yeah, and it's like...

278
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:13,680
Kanbei!

279
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,180
Yeah!

280
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,400
But, like, I can't.

281
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,300
I don't really like...

282
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:19,700
I don't like...

283
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,460
Actually, I don't even like wine, to be fair.

284
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,840
I don't think you like alcohol.

285
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,440
Well, no, it's just like...

286
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:25,640
Okay.

287
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,460
It's just too...

288
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,080
Sour?

289
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,100
Slash...

290
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,880
It's just, like, sour slash bitter for me.

291
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,340
So, like, I just can't handle wine, in general, as well.

292
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,520
Uh, just cause, like, the taste of it is just...

293
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,180
I just like...

294
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,160
I just like it when it's...

295
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,640
When it doesn't taste like alcohol.

296
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:40,960
Yeah.

297
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,680
It's all those fruity cocktails.

298
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,040
Yeah, like the fruity cocktails.

299
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:44,440
Yeah.

300
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,680
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.

301
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:46,520
Alright.

302
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,300
So, my sound guy said to bring down the BGM, so I'll bring it down a little bit.

303
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:51,460
Um...

304
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,200
I haven't drawn...

305
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,240
I actually have not drawn in a very long time.

306
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,000
Oh, yeah.

307
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:56,720
Yeah, me too.

308
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,040
Wait, when was the last time you, like...

309
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,820
Like, drawn anything?

310
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,340
I was thinking...

311
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,320
30 minutes ago.

312
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:02,980
I'm sorry.

313
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,860
Okay, before this collab, before we set up this...

314
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,040
I was drawing before!

315
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,680
Yeah, you have been drawing!

316
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,880
Oh, so you've been lying.

317
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:11,680
Yeah, but...

318
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,640
I just with...

319
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,620
Got my...

320
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,040
Tablet.

321
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,340
I have to dust it off.

322
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:15,920
The...

323
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,760
Drawing tablet that connects to the piece.

324
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,580
Cause I usually use my iPad, and it won't connect.

325
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:19,820
Yeah.

326
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:20,820
Oh...

327
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,540
I'll use...

328
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,720
Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

329
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,020
Oh, guys, don't mind the circles.

330
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,040
I was testing out brushes.

331
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:25,760
Alright.

332
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,080
What program are you using?

333
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,100
I'm using Paint Tool Sai.

334
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,120
Oh, me too!

335
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:30,520
Okay.

336
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,720
Are you using Sai 1 or 2?

337
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,700
Wait, you didn't know there was a 2?

338
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,240
I thought there was a 2.

339
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:36,960
I don't know.

340
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,440
Man...

341
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,240
I'm just not with the time, bro.

342
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:40,540
It should say...

343
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,540
It should say 2 on the top left.

344
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:43,580
It should say...

345
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:43,900
Top left?

346
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:44,400
Oh!

347
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,300
It just...

348
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,620
Maybe this is just 1 then.

349
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,640
Oh my god!

350
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,600
Wait, there's 2?

351
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,520
Yes, there's 2.

352
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,980
It came out 10 years ago.

353
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:51,340
Version info.

354
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,060
Oh my god!

355
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,160
I didn't see version 1.

356
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,980
Dude, I have...

357
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,260
I'm...

358
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,760
I'm in aura depth right now.

359
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:58,140
This is nuts.

360
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,800
Okay, to be fair, to be fair, everybody usually use clips...

361
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:01,980
Uh, what was it called?

362
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,120
Clip Studio, right?

363
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:03,520
Yeah, Clip Studio.

364
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,860
Everyone uses Clip Studio now.

365
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,760
Like, people who still use, like, Sai just refuse to, like, learn.

366
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:09,900
Um, which is me.

367
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:10,160
That's me!

368
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:10,800
Yeah, me too!

369
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,480
I don't wanna change.

370
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,120
I don't...

371
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,920
I don't like change.

372
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,140
I'm using this program.

373
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,660
I don't like change.

374
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,380
Okay, to be fair, have you seen Clip Studio?

375
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,080
Find the program.

376
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:19,820
Like, use the program?

377
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,140
I have.

378
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,180
I've used it before.

379
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:21,720
It's good.

380
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,380
Yeah, it's good, but the...

381
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,280
It's so overwhelming.

382
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,540
Like, you know how Clip Studio, everything's just there?

383
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:28,240
Mm-hmm.

384
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,100
And then, um, not Clip Studio, sorry.

385
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,740
Paying Toe Sai, everything's just there.

386
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,480
And, it's like so...

387
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:33,580
Straightforward.

388
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,460
I like that.

389
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:34,900
Yeah, it's simple.

390
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:35,860
It's simple.

391
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,740
I keep it simple.

392
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,120
And then, I see like Clip Studio, and there's like...

393
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:40,560
Different...

394
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,520
There's just so many...

395
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,360
The overlay is just so intimidating.

396
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,400
And, I used it, like, one time, and I just crawled back to Sai.

397
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:53,360
I feel like if you're just used to a program... you know, you can make art out of anything, right?

398
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,340
Yes, true.

399
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,200
That's so true.

400
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,460
Like, people can make, like, those, like... or the Roblox ones.

401
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,300
Have you seen the Roblox artists?

402
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:01,820
Roblox?

403
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,680
Wait, you've never seen the Roblox artists?

404
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,300
So much art.

405
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:10,260
You can go to, like, a... there's, like, Roblox servers dedicated to, like, Roblox artists.

406
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,200
And they would actually draw, like, the Mona Lisa and stuff like that on Roblox.

407
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,440
Yeah, like, there's, like, a... I only know about it because it popped up on my Twitter...

408
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,260
my For You Twitter feed.

409
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:28,420
And they're like, here's, like, a... here's a three-hour time lapse of my artwork being drawn at the server.

410
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,320
And I was like, what the fuck?

411
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,560
This was done in Roblox?

412
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,160
I feel like good artists can draw Mona Lisa's anywhere.

413
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,400
Yeah, that's so true.

414
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:37,640
You know?

415
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,740
Like, I've seen the coffee stain art, whatever, and it was fantastic.

416
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,360
Oh.

417
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,400
Are you okay?

418
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,640
No, I'm great.

419
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,200
I'm great.

420
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,020
I'm just really excited to draw Pokemon.

421
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,540
Oh, yeah, we're gonna start with Pokemons first.

422
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:53,780
Alright.

423
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,260
Sure.

424
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,580
Sure, yeah, let's do that.

425
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:55,900
Alright.

426
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,960
We'll take a suggestion from Lily's chat.

427
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,740
Since, you know, Lily Pichu.

428
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,620
Oh, yeah.

429
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,560
I always forget about that shit.

430
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,260
Wait, what the fuck?

431
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,480
12-year-old Lily.

432
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,760
I could not think of anything else.

433
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,960
Was Pichu even your favorite Pokemon?

434
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:12,880
It was.

435
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,280
To be fair, it was my favorite Pokemon back then.

436
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,820
Because I thought, oh, it's like, it's not Pikachu and everyone loves Pikachu.

437
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,160
Yeah, yeah.

438
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:20,780
Wait.

439
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,220
12-year-old.

440
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,920
What's your favorite Pokemon now, then?

441
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,440
I like Comfy.

442
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:25,460
Comfy?

443
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,020
Which one's that?

444
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,100
It's like the circle of flowers that floats.

445
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,840
Oh, it's that one!

446
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:32,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

447
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:33,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

448
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,280
Wait, I know.

449
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,660
She's also the...

450
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,640
Have you ever played...

451
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,520
Oh my gosh, what's the Pokemon League of Legends?

452
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,840
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

453
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,460
Pokemon Unite!

454
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,060
Pokemon Unite?

455
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,060
Have you ever played Pokemon Unite?

456
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:43,660
She's the Yumi of...

457
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,940
Yeah, she's the cat!

458
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,140
She's the cat!

459
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,020
You don't have to do anything!

460
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,440
You don't do shit!

461
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,700
You just attack yourself to people!

462
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:50,520
I play Comfy...

463
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,120
No, I...

464
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,340
I...

465
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,400
I didn't...

466
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,340
I was not a Comfy main.

467
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:54,940
I was bored.

468
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,620
I like Sylveon and Pikachu.

469
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,720
Oh my gosh, me too.

470
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,660
I love Sylveon.

471
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,680
What's your favorite Eeveelution?

472
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:03,740
Sylveon.

473
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,460
Okay, one of the biggest reasons why...

474
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:13,360
I always tell this in my chat, but one of the biggest reasons why I love Sylveon is the fact that when I found out...

475
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:13,560
It's pink!

476
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,140
No.

477
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:14,700
Sorry, go on.

478
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:14,880
No.

479
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,620
To be honest, pink is actually not my favorite color.

480
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,420
Uh...

481
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:20,580
But...

482
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:21,880
Um...

483
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,380
But one of the reasons is because when I found out that...

484
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:24,620
The...

485
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:25,760
The...

486
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,780
The ribbons are actually, like, made out of his flesh.

487
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,160
And, like, I thought it was, like, super hardcore.

488
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,480
If you think about it.

489
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,420
Because the ribbons, when they touch you, they're feeling your emotion.

490
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,000
And for that to happen, it's made of, literally, flesh ribbons.

491
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,820
I did not know that.

492
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:41,200
Yeah.

493
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,120
I thought it was just ribbons.

494
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:42,800
No, no.

495
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,660
They use their ribbons...

496
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,760
To, like, touch your body.

497
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,100
To, like, feel what you're feeling and stuff like that.

498
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,300
And then I was like, oh my god.

499
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,820
They're literally attached to their skin.

500
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:52,780
Like...

501
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,280
It's...

502
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,480
Wow.

503
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:55,580
Wait, that...

504
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,160
That's cool.

505
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:56,680
Yeah.

506
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,180
And I was like, wait, that's so hardcore.

507
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,520
Like...

508
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,300
Alright.

509
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,520
What did your chat pick?

510
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:03,580
Um...

511
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,000
Okay, sorry.

512
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:04,500
Uh...

513
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,420
Beedrill.

514
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,560
A lot of people said Beedrill.

515
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,400
Oh my god.

516
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,740
I don't remember this at all.

517
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,940
But I would do my best.

518
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,300
Okay?

519
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,340
Um...

520
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,300
There's a reason why.

521
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:14,820
Okay.

522
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,060
There's a reason why your chat picked Beedrill.

523
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:19,500
Yeah.

524
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,520
I...

525
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,320
I'm assuming you're very...

526
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,260
You love Beedrill?

527
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:24,720
No.

528
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:25,480
No!

529
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,940
Do you love Beedrill?

530
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:28,580
I think...

531
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,140
Okay, it was...

532
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:29,820
That's fine.

533
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,280
I'm not judging anything.

534
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:31,960
It's fine.

535
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,360
This was a long time ago.

536
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:34,960
Uh-huh.

537
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:39,580
But basically, the reason why they're picking Beedrill is because...

538
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,340
Oh my gosh.

539
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,060
The fact that I actually remember how to draw Beedrill because of this.

540
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:43,980
Um...

541
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:48,640
I did something similar where I was like, oh, I'm gonna draw Pokemon from memory.

542
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,440
And then I was like, fuck Beedrill.

543
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,460
Beedrill looks so...

544
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,760
It's so dumb and stupid and hard to draw.

545
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:55,680
Um...

546
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,420
Because I was like, okay throughout it until I got to Beedrill.

547
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,500
And then...

548
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:04,080
And then I was like, I'm gonna skip Beedrill for the entire...

549
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,280
Like, I'm gonna skip Beedrill.

550
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:05,780
I don't care.

551
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:06,780
And then...

552
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:07,000
Oh.

553
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,440
They're like, what if we bribe you?

554
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,320
And I was like, you have to give me a hundred dollars if you...

555
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,860
Someone give you a hundred dollars.

556
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:13,120
I see.

557
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,340
Not just someone.

558
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,790
I got like...

559
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,160
50 plus...

560
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,680
50 plus donations!

561
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,860
To draw Beedrill?

562
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:23,380
To draw.

563
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,700
Because I was like, I will...

564
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,520
Every hundred dollars I get, I'll draw one Beedrill.

565
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,960
So then I got...

566
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,520
I drew...

567
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,420
I don't even remember how many Beedrills I drew.

568
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,660
I actually had to turn off my donations.

569
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,640
Like, I had to turn off my super chats.

570
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,780
So I didn't have to draw more Beedrills.

571
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,080
Wait, that's...

572
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,700
Honestly, bang for your buck.

573
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,420
I like that.

574
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,060
But like...

575
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:53,060
The thing is, I had to like, keep my promise.

576
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,280
So I spent like...

577
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:58,120
I think like eight plus hours just trying Beedrill.

578
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,800
Over and over and over.

579
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,560
And then I outsourced it too.

580
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,760
I outsourced it to my friends.

581
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:06,480
You outsourced it.

582
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:06,940
I would like...

583
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:10,520
I like invited my friends to join the stream and I outsourced it to the...

584
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,280
They didn't get paid.

585
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,140
They...

586
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,000
They...

587
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,220
They were just there...

588
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:15,680
They were...

589
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,500
They were...

590
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,080
They got paid in being my company.

591
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,440
Yeah, in my company.

592
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,720
So...

593
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,280
Um...

594
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,100
So they drew...

595
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,660
Help me drew some Beedrills too.

596
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:25,780
Uh...

597
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,400
To...

598
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,480
To repay the debt.

599
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:28,880
The Beedrill debt.

600
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,820
Well, I'm drawing one right now.

601
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:32,420
So...

602
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:32,940
Get to it.

603
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,560
I'm drawing one too.

604
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,280
Oh my gosh.

605
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:35,600
Okay.

606
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,480
Oh my fucking...

607
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,400
I don't remember how to...

608
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:37,940
Okay.

609
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,100
I know I said I...

610
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,460
I remember how to draw a Beedrill.

611
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,700
But I actually sort of low-key...

612
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,120
I remember like vaguely how to draw a Beedrill.

613
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,920
There's a...

614
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,040
Oh, this is so bad.

615
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:49,960
Okay.

616
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:50,900
And then like...

617
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,880
There's his wings.

618
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,560
And...

619
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,200
Oh god.

620
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,900
It's like one of those Pokemon I just don't draw ever.

621
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,160
Okay.

622
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,500
Like I don't know what it looks like.

623
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,320
Okay.

624
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,080
I...

625
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,700
Beedrill...

626
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:05,820
Yellow.

627
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,300
...stands on his two legs.

628
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,480
He's like an...

629
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,600
He has two legs?

630
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,300
And...

631
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:11,940
Okay.

632
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:12,780
Keep describing it.

633
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,460
This is kind of open.

634
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:13,740
Okay.

635
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:13,840
Okay.

636
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:14,360
Okay.

637
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:14,940
Okay.

638
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,080
So he looks like a bee.

639
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,200
And...

640
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,920
Adam, you know this.

641
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:23,740
Oh my...

642
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,280
Drill, right.

643
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:24,760
Yeah.

644
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,160
And his two arms are his drills.

645
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,480
So...

646
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,040
Oh!

647
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:30,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

648
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,020
Oh, no, no.

649
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:32,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

650
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,220
Yeah, yeah.

651
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:34,180
So...

652
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:34,900
Oh my gosh.

653
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:36,760
Okay, wait.

654
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:37,780
Is it like this?

655
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,740
I think it's kind of like that.

656
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:41,820
Oh my gosh.

657
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,360
I'm...

658
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:42,440
Okay.

659
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,320
So...

660
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:43,880
And then...

661
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,220
So...

662
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,460
And then the top is...

663
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,960
It's just a bee head.

664
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,040
And then he's standing on his two legs.

665
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,900
He has two legs.

666
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,220
Okay.

667
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:51,560
Yeah.

668
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,940
And he has two drills.

669
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,740
How do his legs look?

670
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,600
Can you describe them?

671
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,200
I...

672
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:57,500
I...

673
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,880
That's the one part I don't remember.

674
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:02,640
That's...

675
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,200
Okay, it's fine.

676
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:03,900
I'm just gonna...

677
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:04,620
I'm just gonna wait.

678
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,120
Is it...

679
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,080
Are they buff?

680
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:06,560
Are they...

681
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,260
Are they skinny?

682
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:07,740
Like...

683
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,680
I think they're skinny?

684
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,620
Because it's a bug?

685
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:10,360
I...

686
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:10,720
I...

687
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,220
That's true.

688
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:11,640
That's true.

689
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,200
That's true.

690
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,080
It should be skinny because he's a bug, right?

691
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,880
Also, the worst part is that...

692
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,560
Since I haven't...

693
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,880
I never...

694
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,140
Um...

695
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:20,420
Uh...

696
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,240
I haven't downloaded Paint Tool Sai on this PC.

697
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,340
So, like...

698
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,320
I lost all my brushes.

699
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,220
So...

700
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,260
I was so sad.

701
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:27,820
Wait, same.

702
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,420
I got a new PC recently and I have lost everything.

703
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,860
Yeah, I was so sad.

704
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:32,480
Because, like...

705
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,720
I actually had, like, a custom brushes and everything.

706
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,160
And I had, like...

707
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,820
I lost it all.

708
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:38,880
Yeah.

709
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,360
So, I don't remember what my brushes were.

710
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:42,980
Yeah, I think I...

711
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:43,880
I think I nailed it.

712
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:44,840
I think I'm good.

713
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:45,680
I...

714
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,800
Wait, you're already done?

715
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,160
Oh, sorry, guys.

716
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:49,340
I'll...

717
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,360
I'll details while you're doing.

718
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,100
No, don't worry about it.

719
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:51,800
Take your time.

720
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,380
Take your time.

721
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,700
I'm just gonna add some details.

722
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,560
Okay, maybe I'll...

723
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,700
I'll do faster then.

724
00:17:59,140 --> 00:17:59,460
Alright.

725
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,200
You know what?

726
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:02,660
Fuck it.

727
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,640
I'm just gonna...

728
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,840
The top part, I tried and then I stopped trying.

729
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,080
Wait, how deta...

730
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:15,460
You know what?

731
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,120
I'll see how detailed we're going.

732
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,960
Oh no, it's not detailed by it.

733
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,120
It's not detailed.

734
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,900
Let's make a change track.

735
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:23,660
I'll know.

736
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,380
I'll know.

737
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,000
It's not detailed.

738
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,280
I straighta...

739
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,500
I straighta gave up.

740
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,160
I...

741
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,180
We'll fix it in post.

742
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,540
We'll fix it in post.

743
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:36,540
I...

744
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,400
Ready to send it?

745
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:38,900
Okay.

746
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:39,440
Wait, uh.

747
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:39,860
Alright.

748
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,280
Yeah, I'm ready.

749
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,920
I'm just gonna snip it from my OBS.

750
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,560
Yeah, I'm just gonna copy-paste it.

751
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,400
Yeah, it's gonna be from my OBS.

752
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:51,260
Okay.

753
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:55,860
Look, it's just warm-up, it's... Send yours, send yours, send yours, send yours!

754
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,140
I'll never be able to live up to this.

755
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,440
I'll never be able to live up to this.

756
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:17,480
I feel like the alcohol has already hit it for you.

757
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,980
Oh my god.

758
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:22,620
Okay, who do you think is less accurate?

759
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:23,320
Okay.

760
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,240
I mean, more accurate.

761
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,440
Who do you think is more accurate?

762
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,980
I would say you, right?

763
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:34,180
I mean, I feel like it would be me because I had the experience of trying Beedrill so many times.

764
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,300
But... Oh, this is so cute.

765
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,180
Why don't you look up what Beedrill looks like?

766
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,420
Why don't you look it up?

767
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,360
Oh no, I'm gonna be so disappointed.

768
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,540
That's what it looks like?

769
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,240
I see...

770
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,680
That is...

771
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,640
Why did you give him, like, one...

772
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,720
Like, one black strip, like...

773
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,380
I thought... I knew... I knew there was a black stripe.

774
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,100
I just didn't know where it was.

775
00:19:59,620 --> 00:19:59,820
Oh!

776
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,800
Yeah, it looks like he's, like, wearing a little skirt.

777
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,560
Like...

778
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,840
Next Pokemon, next play.

779
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,760
I mean...

780
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,000
Wait.

781
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,480
Why did you give him lips?

782
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,460
I gave him lips?

783
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,740
Oh, I thought...

784
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,260
Yeah, why did you...

785
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:14,660
I don't know why...

786
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:14,880
Why?

787
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,180
I thought Beedrill had a mouth.

788
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,860
It's a bee.

789
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:19,880
Bees have...

790
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,900
No mouth?

791
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,800
Stay in school, kids.

792
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,400
But...

793
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,440
But it's a...

794
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,040
I mean, they do have mouths, but, like, when you look at a bee, like...

795
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,500
Maybe I've never seen a bee up close.

796
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:40,140
To be fair, to be fair, I mean, like, I'm scared of bees, too, but...

797
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:46,660
But, like, when you look at it from, you know, like, a little bit far, you don't really see a mouth in general.

798
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,420
I think.

799
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:48,940
That's true.

800
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,440
I mean, to be fair, they're, like, super fuzzy.

801
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,700
The bumblebees.

802
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,700
All right, my turn.

803
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,460
All right, guys, suggest a...

804
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,220
Suggest a Pokemon, and then we'll pick...

805
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,640
It's your turn, chat.

806
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,380
Don't disappoint us.

807
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,520
We're not gonna do another bug.

808
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,620
We're not gonna...

809
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,600
There's no more bug.

810
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,000
They were trying to suggest a buzz swole.

811
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,500
Oh god, I hope it's...

812
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,500
First three gens, cause I'm...

813
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,440
The first same.

814
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,140
I...

815
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,180
I start falling apart.

816
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:25,780
I, like, stopped paying attention to Pokemon when we went to Paris.

817
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,520
You know the, the XY?

818
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,020
We went to Paris.

819
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,020
Like, oh, no.

820
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,120
They went to Paris!

821
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:31,840
Like, XY!

822
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:32,880
Pokemon XY!

823
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,940
They have an Eiffel Tower!

824
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,860
There was an Eiffel Tower!

825
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,300
I don't think I played XY.

826
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,760
I went straight to Sun and Moon.

827
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,360
You went...

828
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,400
Wait, when did you stop?

829
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,480
Uh...

830
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,200
Like, the first three gens, and then you skipped a gen?

831
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,160
And then you went straight to Sun and Moon?

832
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,660
I think so, yeah.

833
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,240
Okay, someone said...

834
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,020
Uh...

835
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:54,620
Mudkip.

836
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:54,940
Oh!

837
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,360
Okay, Mudkip!

838
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,640
Mudkip, I remember.

839
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,320
Yeah.

840
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:58,840
Okay, yeah.

841
00:21:59,100 --> 00:21:59,420
Yeah, yeah.

842
00:21:59,520 --> 00:21:59,800
This is easy!

843
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,300
This is easy!

844
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:00,800
Mudkip's easy!

845
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:01,220
Yeah!

846
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,060
Yeah!

847
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,120
Remember those Mudkip memes?

848
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:03,900
Yeah, yeah.

849
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,220
Mudkip!

850
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,960
Yeah, that was on DeviantArt.

851
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:08,120
Yeah!

852
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,120
Oh, DeviantArt!

853
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:09,240
I'm sorry!

854
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,140
Okay, so...

855
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:13,960
I went off.

856
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:14,660
Okay, wait.

857
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,320
I actually sort of don't remember Mudkip.

858
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,280
I don't remember the Mudkip.

859
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:17,880
Yeah!

860
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,020
I was like, wait!

861
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,540
He was like...

862
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,840
He had like a big ass mouth.

863
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,400
That's his thing.

864
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,420
Because he was like, Mudkip!

865
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

866
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,560
He said Mudkip.

867
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,480
Yeah, and then...

868
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,960
Oh my god.

869
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,560
I have not drawn in so long.

870
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,580
This has been so long since I've done art.

871
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:41,700
Okay.

872
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:42,900
Accurate.

873
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:43,760
Oh, honest?

874
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,300
I'm kind of cooking with this one.

875
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,240
Oh my gosh.

876
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,120
I miss my brushes.

877
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,960
I feel so like handicapped without my usual brushes.

878
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,940
This one can kill me.

879
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,000
How does his body look?

880
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,460
It's like this, right?

881
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,980
And then he's like...

882
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:10,820
Like a little axolotl?

883
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:12,900
I don't know.

884
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,720
Oh yeah, because he was based off of an axolotl.

885
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,460
Yeah, and those are cute little guys.

886
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,260
And then it was like...

887
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,040
And then he had like little cheek things, right?

888
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,540
Did he have a tail?

889
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,460
Yeah, he did.

890
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,600
That one I remember.

891
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,280
Tail.

892
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,100
Okay, uh...

893
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,820
And then there's like...

894
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,120
It's like his...

895
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:40,740
His...

896
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,340
Oh my gosh.

897
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:41,760
His side.

898
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,860
I know I'm wrong somehow.

899
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,900
I like it.

900
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,640
This is good.

901
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:54,600
I know I'm wrong, but I...

902
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:58,960
I cannot be too sure how wrong I am.

903
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,820
I know he's like...

904
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:02,160
What is it?

905
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,140
Blue and orange, right?

906
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,440
Orange?

907
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,140
No.

908
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,240
Wait, is it not?

909
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,480
His body was blue.

910
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:08,540
Blue?

911
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,800
Yeah, but he had orange things coming out, I remember.

912
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:13,700
Was it not yellow?

913
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:14,500
Or orange?

914
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,800
It was like orange...

915
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,900
Yellow...

916
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,240
Ish?

917
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,020
And then like...

918
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,460
And then yellow...

919
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,360
Yeah, but...

920
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,700
Were these orange too?

921
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,000
Yeah, it was like that.

922
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,060
What?

923
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,420
I'm gonna just try orange.

924
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,540
I guess it's orange.

925
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,720
Yeah, it was like this.

926
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:33,160
Yeah!

927
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,380
I feel like I'm so wrong.

928
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:36,820
Yeah, no, no, no.

929
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,280
Okay!

930
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,680
This does not look right.

931
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,160
This looks...

932
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:41,660
Fantastic.

933
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,400
I might make stickers of this.

934
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,080
Nice.

935
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,120
Capitalism.

936
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,460
Mud.

937
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,440
Was it shiny?

938
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,480
Did it have a glow to it?

939
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,180
A glow?

940
00:24:59,180 --> 00:24:59,340
A glow?

941
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,120
Yeah, like a glow.

942
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,280
What?

943
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:03,460
What?

944
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:03,900
Alright!

945
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,460
Are you trying to draw a shiny right now?

946
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,480
I'm done.

947
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,520
Okay, me too.

948
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,540
Alright.

949
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,480
Okay, okay.

950
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,460
Okay, alright.

951
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,880
Wanna send it at the same time?

952
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:16,700
Alright, yeah.

953
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,980
Three, two, one.

954
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:26,890
Wait, why did I cut the same shit?

955
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:29,470
Your straws are so cute.

956
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:31,410
And tiny.

957
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:34,010
Okay.

958
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:38,210
No, to be fair, the reason why it's tiny is because I'm just snipping it from my OBS.

959
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:42,010
That's the only way I did it so tiny.

960
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:44,810
Okay.

961
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,930
Oh, these are so cute.

962
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:50,410
It's like...

963
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:51,610
Oh no, yours is...

964
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:53,370
I can tell you're the artist here.

965
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:53,910
No.

966
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:54,870
Yours is the artist.

967
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:58,030
It has the same vibe of it though, you know?

968
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,510
Yeah, you know, like...

969
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:01,330
I'm looking up how it looks.

970
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:02,050
Yeah, me too.

971
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:05,750
Wait, are we close?

972
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:06,530
Were we close?

973
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:07,370
I...

974
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:08,170
Were we close?

975
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:10,350
Oh, it was orange.

976
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:11,170
Yeah.

977
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,210
It was.

978
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:13,530
I mean...

979
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,930
We got the cheek part right.

980
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:16,370
Yeah, we got the cheek part right.

981
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:17,490
And I got the tail.

982
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:18,750
I think...

983
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:19,270
Yeah, I got it.

984
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:19,910
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

985
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:20,910
I got the tail right.

986
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,150
It was...

987
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:22,990
The top part.

988
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,470
I didn't realize the top was blue.

989
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:25,950
I forgot all about it.

990
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:26,030
I forgot.

991
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,250
I thought it was orange too.

992
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,830
Yeah, I thought it was like part...

993
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,350
The same color as...

994
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,290
You know what?

995
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:33,370
We did pretty well.

996
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,490
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

997
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:35,630
Look, see?

998
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:36,750
I mean, it's almost...

999
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:38,170
Almost looks...

1000
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:43,390
I feel like if both of our artworks had a drawing, it will produce the original Mudkip.

1001
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:44,490
Yeah, yeah.

1002
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,210
Yeah, like, because I got the...

1003
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:50,890
I got like, sort of the tail and the body right.

1004
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:53,190
And then you got the face correct.

1005
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:57,950
I think we did pretty good.

1006
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,090
I think, you know what?

1007
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:00,670
Feels like you were like...

1008
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:03,070
For some reason, I have a feeling that you draw a lot.

1009
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:07,910
No, I'm just a small-time artist.

1010
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:11,030
Yeah, it's just a little hobby of yours.

1011
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:11,950
You picked up a...

1012
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:14,090
You just started picking up a tablet.

1013
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,190
I see your little...

1014
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:19,470
I see the sketch layer in yours.

1015
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,710
I see it.

1016
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:22,390
Yeah, I don't know.

1017
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:24,470
For me, I've never really learned how...

1018
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:24,890
Not...

1019
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:25,510
I won't say...

1020
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,730
Is learning the right word?

1021
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:29,850
I never, like, learned how to do, like, freehand drawing.

1022
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:31,830
I'm so bad at freehand.

1023
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,030
It's just...

1024
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:33,850
I always...

1025
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:34,210
I had...

1026
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:36,750
When I actually used to draw, which was, like, years ago...

1027
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:38,190
Um...

1028
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:40,930
It would take me, like, a lot of...

1029
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:45,130
Like, it would take me, like, three to four hours for a finished GB in general.

1030
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:46,550
Oh, I see, I see.

1031
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:49,130
Yeah, because, like, I would, like, control Z all the time.

1032
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,970
Because I wanted, like, perfect lines and everything.

1033
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:54,090
Um...

1034
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:55,910
So, like, it was just...

1035
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:57,230
I don't know how to draw fast.

1036
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:59,670
It would take me, like, hours to even draw one thing.

1037
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:02,530
I think I am the opposite word.

1038
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:04,910
Because I streamed myself drawing...

1039
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,550
And chat has, like, such...

1040
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:07,490
Such...

1041
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:09,370
Dogshade attention span sometimes.

1042
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:10,590
I have to...

1043
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:13,050
I feel like I taught myself I gotta draw really fast.

1044
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:13,530
Oh, yeah.

1045
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:15,350
Or, like, chat would judge me.

1046
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:16,770
I don't want to embarrass myself.

1047
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:17,190
Oh, they're gonna yell at me.

1048
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:17,610
Yeah.

1049
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:22,810
I think when I used to do, like, art streams, I just, like...

1050
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:28,010
I would, like, draw for, like, ten minutes and then spend the rest of the time just chatting with my stream.

1051
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:32,390
So, like, nothing would be done.

1052
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:33,150
All right.

1053
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:34,490
All right, Lillies, chat.

1054
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:35,830
Choose the next art...

1055
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,810
Okay, chat, give me a suggestion.

1056
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:39,270
It doesn't have to be Pokemon.

1057
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:40,930
Oh, yeah.

1058
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:43,290
Honestly, send us whatever you guys want.

1059
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:44,230
Yeah, send us whatever.

1060
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,210
Let's do whatever you want.

1061
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,550
Some of these are not Pokemon.

1062
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:51,690
Why Arbok?

1063
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:53,330
Arbok's...

1064
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:54,130
Oh, Arbok's Pokemon.

1065
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:55,610
That's the snake.

1066
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:56,450
Because it's backwards.

1067
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:58,210
It's, like, it's from Ikans.

1068
00:28:58,530 --> 00:28:59,290
You know Ikans?

1069
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:02,310
The other snake and it's snake backwards.

1070
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,290
Yeah, and Cobra.

1071
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:04,810
Yeah, and Cobra.

1072
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:07,490
Oh, yeah, yeah, Arbok is Cobra backwards.

1073
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,570
Okay, let's do Arbok then.

1074
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:11,650
I remember Arbok.

1075
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:12,530
He's like...

1076
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:13,010
Arbok.

1077
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:14,570
You know what?

1078
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:16,430
And then he had, like, the little...

1079
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:19,610
He had a handsome face, from what I remember.

1080
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,390
For a snake?

1081
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:23,650
Yeah, for a snake.

1082
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:27,030
What does that mean?

1083
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:27,770
What does that mean?

1084
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:28,930
I'm gonna try and freehand this.

1085
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:29,170
He's a handsome face.

1086
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,270
He's a snake.

1087
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:32,810
And?

1088
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:36,910
What is considered a handsome snake?

1089
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:39,910
I just remember it being a little suave, you know?

1090
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,050
Like, I had a bit of, like, a...

1091
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:43,570
Am I misremembering?

1092
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:44,810
God, I hope I'm not misremembering.

1093
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:45,470
Anyway...

1094
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:45,870
Oh, wait!

1095
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,650
No, I know what you're talking about.

1096
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:52,350
Not the part that, you know, that she's right that the snake was handsome.

1097
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,230
But, like...

1098
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,130
You like snakes.

1099
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:56,430
But...

1100
00:29:57,410 --> 00:30:00,230
I remember exactly when you said, like...

1101
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:02,350
He had, like, the type of face.

1102
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:04,070
I was like, oh, I know what...

1103
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:04,610
Yeah, you remember?

1104
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:05,310
It was like a...

1105
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:05,490
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1106
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:07,690
I'm kind of looking at you sort of way, you know?

1107
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:08,830
Like a sassy face.

1108
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:09,610
Yeah, yeah.

1109
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,090
And then he had, like...

1110
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:15,270
Because it was a cobra, he had the little frill thing at the top.

1111
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:16,790
Oh, man.

1112
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:17,690
Wait, are you a skelly?

1113
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:20,090
A skelly?

1114
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:21,690
You mean, like, do I, like...

1115
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:22,690
Snakes?

1116
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,090
So, like...

1117
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:29,410
So, like, you know furries?

1118
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:30,170
Yeah.

1119
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:31,630
So, like, that's, like, the...

1120
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:34,890
That's basically for, like, skellies, it's like furries.

1121
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:38,330
But, like, specifically for, like, reptiles.

1122
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:43,030
Oh, that's why Skara calls himself, um, his fans...

1123
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:44,410
Or his viewers, skellies.

1124
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:45,010
Yeah, yeah.

1125
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,570
Because he's trying to say they're all...

1126
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:49,750
They're all sexually attracted to reptiles.

1127
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:54,510
I think I'd rather be a furry.

1128
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:55,730
Wait, why?

1129
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:56,670
Over a skelly.

1130
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:57,150
A horseman.

1131
00:30:58,330 --> 00:30:58,950
You're a horse...

1132
00:30:58,950 --> 00:30:59,570
Oh, you're a ho...

1133
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:01,010
Oh, yeah, you're a horse girl now.

1134
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:02,670
Have you ever had...

1135
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:03,310
I was...

1136
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:05,150
Have you ever had a horse girl, Ari?

1137
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:05,910
Never?

1138
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,050
No, never.

1139
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:09,570
Umamu Sima is, like, my entry to...

1140
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:11,830
Wait, not even, like, Milo Pony?

1141
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:16,730
I mean, I liked it, but I wasn't, like, super into it, you know?

1142
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:17,890
Oh, so you were in, like, a...

1143
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:18,490
What's it called?

1144
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:19,490
A Pegasus-y.

1145
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,530
I was not a Pegasus-y.

1146
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,030
Who were...

1147
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,310
Were you?

1148
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:27,810
No, no, I...

1149
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:29,170
I didn't watch...

1150
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:29,410
I didn't...

1151
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:30,610
Why did you...

1152
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:32,190
Why didn't you say it like that?

1153
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,390
No, I'm just crazy.

1154
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:36,810
You had no judgment here.

1155
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:40,990
I was, unfortunately, not a Pegasus-y, but I did...

1156
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:43,790
I did watch the show, because, like, I actually, like...

1157
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:45,370
I'm, like, a huge animation fan.

1158
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:48,050
So, like, I really liked the animation for Milo Pony.

1159
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,010
You're like Applejack!

1160
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:51,050
Sorry.

1161
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:51,830
Applejack?

1162
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:53,070
Not Rainbow Dash?

1163
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:54,630
Rainbow Dash!

1164
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:57,650
But...

1165
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:59,730
I only said Apple because of the blonde hair.

1166
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:00,170
Oh!

1167
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:00,850
Apple Dash...

1168
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:02,310
Wait, the Apple Dash had a...

1169
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,830
Oh, yeah, Apple Dash did have blonde hair.

1170
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:04,250
Mm-hmm.

1171
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:06,690
Yeah, and then she had, like, braids and stuff, too.

1172
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:07,990
But, like, you know, like...

1173
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:09,890
Each episode cost, like...

1174
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:11,370
I think, like, $440,000.

1175
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:13,490
Holy crap.

1176
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:16,390
I might be making numbers up, but it was, like...

1177
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:16,810
Triple...

1178
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,350
Like, it was, like, you know, six figures.

1179
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:20,730
Basically, per, like, episode.

1180
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:24,850
And, yeah, it was, like, super fucking expensive.

1181
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,830
But, like, you know, it's Hasbro.

1182
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:27,750
They have the money.

1183
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:29,850
They have...

1184
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:32,650
You're very knowledgeable about My Little Pony.

1185
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:35,770
Well, I just, like, I, like, I have, like, anim...

1186
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:37,830
I just know a lot of animation facts in general.

1187
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:40,850
Because, like, I spent too much...

1188
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:44,930
I was chronically online before I became a streamer.

1189
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:46,550
I'm not...

1190
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:51,070
And we are still chronically online.

1191
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:51,870
Anyway, I'm done.

1192
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:52,210
We're still chronically...

1193
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:52,830
Oh, me too.

1194
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:54,050
Oh, sick.

1195
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:54,990
Alright.

1196
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,410
I don't think I cooked with this one.

1197
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:58,350
Me too.

1198
00:32:58,690 --> 00:32:59,770
Well, my...

1199
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:05,910
I tried to draw a face on the...

1200
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:07,050
Like, you know, like...

1201
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:08,090
Because they're, like, a cobra.

1202
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,810
Oh, my God.

1203
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:14,350
You put...

1204
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,050
Why did you put...

1205
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:21,170
Why did you put so much effort on this?

1206
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:23,990
I didn't know how long it was supposed to be.

1207
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:26,030
But it was, like...

1208
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,350
I'm, like, if you scroll up...

1209
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:31,870
If you scroll up, like, you can see how fast you did Vigil.

1210
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:33,850
And then for some reason, you're...

1211
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:34,510
You're...

1212
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:37,270
He's so...

1213
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:39,970
Your art book is so detailed.

1214
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:41,430
Like, I...

1215
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:42,550
I don't...

1216
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:43,990
You got the eyes on the thing.

1217
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:45,430
I didn't know what those were.

1218
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:46,650
Wait, what?

1219
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,150
Oh, you mean the...

1220
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:49,190
The, um...

1221
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:51,470
He had a face on his chest or something, right?

1222
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,230
Wait, he had a face on his chest?

1223
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:55,610
I thought it was, like, on...

1224
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:56,730
Are those not eyes?

1225
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:57,950
Wait, okay, wait.

1226
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:58,830
All right.

1227
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:01,130
Let me look it up.

1228
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:02,350
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1229
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:02,770
It looks like an elephant.

1230
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:06,610
Yeah, I remember he had, like, evil eyes and everything.

1231
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:09,510
But, like, I couldn't remember exactly what...

1232
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:10,690
I knew there was red on it.

1233
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:12,610
And I was like, oh, whatever.

1234
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:13,890
I don't see color right now.

1235
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:14,710
I...

1236
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:16,710
I can only see in...

1237
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:18,250
I can only see in...

1238
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,870
In black and white right now.

1239
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:23,210
Yours looks like an elephant.

1240
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:28,730
With the elephant ears on...

1241
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:32,770
I feel like mine looks like an Egyptian drawing.

1242
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:34,890
Oh, that's so fun.

1243
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:37,710
Keep those.

1244
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:41,210
All right, chat.

1245
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:42,470
My chat time.

1246
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,210
Time to give us...

1247
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:45,290
Give us a...

1248
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:46,390
Any character.

1249
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:47,530
It doesn't have to be Pokemon.

1250
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:49,730
We're not locked into Pokemon, right?

1251
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:50,110
We really are.

1252
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,850
You can suggest whatever you want.

1253
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:53,250
Whatever you want, guys.

1254
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:53,850
Not...

1255
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:55,330
Not just Pokemon.

1256
00:34:56,410 --> 00:34:58,970
I like how I say that and it's still just Pokemon.

1257
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:02,990
Guys, we're not gonna draw Starscream.

1258
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:05,590
I don't think, like, either of us can.

1259
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:25,190
I'm just kidding.

1260
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1261
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:27,630
Okay, so...

1262
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:29,990
He's basically a Decepticon.

1263
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,490
And you know what Decepticons are?

1264
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:34,550
Oh, boy.

1265
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:37,230
All right, let me explain the lore of Transformers.

1266
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:40,350
So, in Transformers, it's...

1267
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:42,030
In Transformers, it's...

1268
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,010
You know Autobots?

1269
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:45,770
Okay, so...

1270
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:48,690
So, these are robots in cars.

1271
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:51,210
So, they're robots in disguise.

1272
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:53,570
But they're not just cars.

1273
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:56,810
They can be, like, any, like, mechanical thing.

1274
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,330
Or not mechanical thing.

1275
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:00,030
Depending on if it's Beast Wars.

1276
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:02,630
Because for Beast Wars, they can scan animals.

1277
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:05,190
And then turn into the animals' machine...

1278
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:07,470
Like, the machine's machinery animals.

1279
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:10,070
But so, there's different types of Transformers.

1280
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:14,190
The ones you know is Optimus Prime.

1281
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:15,370
And he's an Autobot.

1282
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:17,430
And an Autobot is, like, the good robot.

1283
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:21,290
And then he's against Megatron, who is a bad robot.

1284
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:25,690
And his crew is called Decepticons.

1285
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:27,290
And then, so, it's, like...

1286
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:29,750
It's, like, a millennia year-long battle.

1287
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:32,770
Between the Autobots versus the Decepticons.

1288
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:37,790
And so, like, Megatron's right-hand man is called Starscream.

1289
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,710
And the reason why his name is Starscream...

1290
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:45,950
Is because his voice is, like, super shrill and everything.

1291
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:48,130
So, that's why his name is Starscream.

1292
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:48,690
Because...

1293
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:49,230
Actually, no.

1294
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:51,110
It depends on which version it is.

1295
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:53,870
Because in another version, his voice was normal.

1296
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:55,750
But then Megatron, like, choked him.

1297
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:57,370
Like, and choked him.

1298
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:58,050
And he liked it.

1299
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:00,010
And then his voice turned to be, like, shrillian.

1300
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,010
And everything because of it.

1301
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:04,230
Because Megatron broke his voice box.

1302
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:07,310
And so, like, that's why his voice is like that now.

1303
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:12,150
But anyway, Starscream is, like, the right-hand man of Megatron.

1304
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:13,610
And...

1305
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:17,230
Lily, are you getting all of that?

1306
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:19,330
Yeah, I'm trying while you're...

1307
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:19,990
Oh, okay.

1308
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,670
I'm trying while you're talking, yeah.

1309
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:22,370
Okay, so, yeah.

1310
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:26,710
So, Starscream is, like, the evil right-hand man of Megatron.

1311
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:27,530
And his entire...

1312
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:30,930
And he wants to actually be the leader of the Septicons.

1313
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:34,350
So, he's always trying to sabotage, like, Megatron's plans.

1314
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:35,650
Or, like, trying to kill him and everything.

1315
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:37,230
But anyway, Starscream.

1316
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:39,310
Basically, he looks...

1317
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:42,310
It depends on which version you're talking about in Transformers.

1318
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:43,470
There's, like, various...

1319
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:47,510
There's, like, various designs of Starscream.

1320
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:49,430

There's Beast Wars Starscream.

1328
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:04,170
What does he look like?

1329
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:05,630
Just curious.

1330
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:06,970
I just want to...

1331
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:08,330
Okay, okay.

1332
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:09,150
So, sorry.

1333
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:10,950
I just need to make sure that you know the whole...

1334
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:11,770

00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:13,150
Yeah, no, I think I got it.

1336
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:16,770
So, he put that into the feeling of Starscream.

1337
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,370
Like, he put that in the feeling.

1338
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:19,890

00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:26,310
He's a jet.

1343
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:27,470
Yeah, he's a jet.

1344
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:28,910
So, untransformed.

He looks like...

1346
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:33,110
Okay, it's like a robot face.

I didn't try.

1410
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:59,450
Actually, I just want to see what you drew.

1411
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:02,670
As someone who's never seen stars green before.

1412

And red.

1430
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:30,230
Got it, got it, got it.

00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:30,990
And his, uh...

1432
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:33,730
And then, don't forget the Decepticon logo on his wing.

1433
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:35,650
So, Decepticon...

1434
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:39,530
Okay, yeah, no, I got it.

1435
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,310
So, he has a Decepticon logo.

1436
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:44,150
And his Decepticon logo...

1437
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:44,450
Yeah.

1438
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:45,890
Is on his right wing.

1439
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:46,970
Right wing?

1440
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:47,330
Yeah.

1441
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:49,110
And so, the Decepticon logo...

1442
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:49,790
It's, like...

1443
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,230
Just draw, like, a head.

1444
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:53,370
And then he has two pointy horns.

1445
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:55,510
On that.

1446
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:55,870
Got it.

1447
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:56,090
Yeah.

1448
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,010
And then, what about shoes?

1449
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:04,010
Shoes, it's, like...

1450
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:05,650
I think it's blue.

1451
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:06,990
I think it's blue.

1452
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:07,890
Okay.

1453
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:09,370
I will stick with blue.

1454
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:12,150
And I'm pretty much done, then.

1455
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:13,250
Okay.

1456
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:14,970
I didn't draw it.

1457
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:15,750
Because I...

1458
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:17,450
I just wanted to...

1459
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:19,970
Make sure you portray it accurately.

1460
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:27,710
I got to look up Starscream.

1461
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:28,770
I'm gonna see what...

1462
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:29,550
Was I close?

1463
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:31,570
Oh, I wasn't close.

1464
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:38,030
Oh...

1465
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,650
Because it's a star, you know?

1466
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:40,790
Because I...

1467
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,230
I thought the star was...

1468
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:46,570
I said...

1469
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:48,130
I said, like, the Minecraft helmet.

1470
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,270
Then why is it just a wrinkle in the helmet?

1471
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:51,110
I...

1472
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:52,010
Wait, I forgot.

1473
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,960
He's, like, going to war.

1474
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,180
Wow.

1475
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,080
Hey, I think he did a great job.

1476
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:04,600
I...

1477
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,740
You know, to be fair...

1478
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:07,960
Like, you got...

1479
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:11,680
You got the personality of Starscream correct.

1480
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:12,680
You know, I...

1481
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:16,040
People were like, why did you describe the entire plot of...

1482
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,200
Like, the entire origin?

1483
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,640
But look, she got the personality correct.

1484
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:20,640
Yeah, he's evil.

1485
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,980
If I didn't describe his entire life story...

1486
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,180
We wouldn't...

1487
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:26,220
I don't think you could have gotten that yet.

1488
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:27,160
Yeah, exactly.

1489
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,540
It's the same picture.

1490
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,340
He looks just like Starscream.

1491
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,840
I don't think I'm sorry.

1492
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:43,980
I don't think I just threw a star.

1493
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,760
Oh my gosh, I almost finished my can.

1494
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,340
I am definitely not sober.

1495
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:51,240
I...

1496
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,500
I am not...

1497
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:52,680
I am not...

1498
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,120
Alright, it's your turn.

1499
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,600
Alright, chat.

1500
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,240
Again, it doesn't have to be Pokemon.

1501
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,700
It could be whatever you want.

1502
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:04,880
Anything you want.

1503
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:06,580
Anything you want.

1504
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,180
Okay.

1505
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:09,680
Oh god.

1506
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,440
King from Tekken.

1507
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,160
Okay, but like...

1508
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:19,720
Which version?

1509
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:21,980
What's the...

1510
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:23,540
Um...

1511
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:25,020
The one from Sage and Slam.

1512
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,020
The one...

1513
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,060
Yeah, that's the...

1514
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:28,840
The default one, I guess, right?

1515
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:29,580
Huh?

1516
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,660
The default king?

1517
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:32,860
Yeah, the default...

1518
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:33,640
Okay, any king.

1519
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,880
Might as well just be any king.

1520
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:36,220
Okay.

1521
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,220
Any king you want.

1522
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:37,440
Yeah.

1523
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,560
Okay, from what I could remember...

1524
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:43,240
That's the one that had to play so much king.

1525
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:46,500
He was like half naked, right?

1526
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:49,540
Yeah, and he had a mask on.

1527
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:51,080
That's a...

1528
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:51,960
Oh yeah, that's like...

1529
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:52,520
That's not him?

1530
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,180
That's like...

1531
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:55,880
I just thought...

1532
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,840
I keep forgetting he's not a...

1533
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,340
He's not like an actual...

1534
00:43:59,340 --> 00:43:59,980
Like...

1535
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:00,440
Jaguar.

1536
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:02,940
I was like...

1537
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:04,860
Oh yeah, he's actually a man.

1538
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,140
Yeah, he was like...

1539
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:08,560
Shirtless and stuff, right?

1540
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,060
Yeah, he was like...

1541
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:10,880
A shirtless man.

1542
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,380
That just...

1543
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:14,360
Was just really, really into jaguars.

1544
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,000
In general.

1545
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:17,400
And he was like super buff and everything.

1546
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:19,640
So he was like...

1547
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:19,740
Yeah.

1548
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:21,720
And then...

1549
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:22,180
Yeah.

1550
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,440
And then...

1551
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,260
Did he have a cape?

1552
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,300
I feel like he had a cape for some reason.

1553
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:27,780
Did he?

1554
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:28,360
Did he have a cape?

1555
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,200
Am I...

1556
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,800
I don't know what the...

1557
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,060
I forgot what...

1558
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:34,680
What a man's body looks like.

1559
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:36,020
Like, the chest.

1560
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:43,560
What does the chest look like?

1561
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:44,920
Like, are we allowed?

1562
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,840
Just like a really muscular...

1563
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,480
If you draw nipples, is it still bannable on Twitch?

1564
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,340
No, no, that's art.

1565
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:53,520
That's gone, right?

1566
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:55,660
No, remember when they...

1567
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:58,940
Remember when they, like...

1568
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:01,740
Remember when they, like, did a thing where...

1569
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:04,940
Twitch did a rule where they're, like, you can draw porn...

1570
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:05,860
If it's art.

1571
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,620
And then, like...

1572
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:10,560
And then the Twitch art category was just all, like, porn artists.

1573
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:13,580
And then it got, like...

1574
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:16,000
The rule got changed within a day.

1575
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:19,360
And then, like, anyone that drew nipples or anything was bad...

1576
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,040
Like, was, like, considered bannable.

1577
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,620
So that's why I was like, did they fix that?

1578
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,540
Did they fix it?

1579
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,080
I think...

1580
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,740
I think nipples are fine here, right?

1581
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:31,540
I'm assuming...

1582
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:32,880
As long as it's art, right?

1583
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:33,500
Yeah, like...

1584
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,040
Yeah, like, dots.

1585
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:34,980
I was just trying dots.

1586
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,020
Okay, yeah.

1587
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,480
As long as it's not, like, detailed...

1588
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:37,580
Yeah.

1589
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:39,500
I'm not gonna draw a detailed king nipple.

1590
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:41,800
Oh, that's...

1591
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:42,020
Yeah.

1592
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,620
I feel like he had a...

1593
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,640
Cape for some reason.

1594
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,440
Like, I'm not giving up on this idea.

1595
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:48,120
Did he?

1596
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,300
Did he have a cape?

1597
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:52,200
I don't think so, but I...

1598
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:52,540
I don't...

1599
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:53,900
Maybe...

1600
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:56,460
And he had, like, a six pack, cause he's, like, a wrestler.

1601
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,060
He was, he was very muscular.

1602
00:45:58,060 --> 00:45:59,540
How do I draw six packs?

1603
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:00,100
What do they...

1604
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:01,020
What does that look like?

1605
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:05,820
I think I just draw a line, and then, like, three lines going through it.

1606
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:06,640
Cause I'm lazy.

1607
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:09,640
Okay.

1608
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:10,760
What...

1609
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:13,080
What was he, like, leopard colored?

1610
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:13,600
I don't...

1611
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,620
Yeah, and then he...

1612
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:15,480
He wore pants.

1613
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:16,160
That's for sure.

1614
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:17,840
I remember that.

1615
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:19,440
Wait, what was...

1616
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,740
He had pants on.

1617
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,000
Yeah.

1618
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:22,240
Yeah, yeah.

1619
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:23,560
Cause he's, like...

1620
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:24,400
Like a boxer?

1621
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:26,900
Was it boxers?

1622
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:27,200
Okay.

1623
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:29,060
Oh, I have no idea.

1624
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:29,860
Like a boxer...

1625
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:31,860
Boxer...

1626
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:32,300
Oh, whatever.

1627
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:32,680
You know.

1628
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:33,120
And then...

1629
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,720
I'm gonna go with my cape idea.

1630
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:35,600
I just...

1631
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,960
Yeah, I just...

1632
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,100
I feel like you're right.

1633
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:39,160
Because he looks so...

1634
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,100
Naked without...

1635
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:40,760
Like, I mean, he was...

1636
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:41,480
He is half naked.

1637
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:44,220
But he looks really naked without a cape on.

1638
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:45,080
So...

1639
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,280
I feel like you're right.

1640
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:49,920
This is...

1641
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,340
The worst...

1642
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:52,000
One yet.

1643
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:54,860
I tried.

1644
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:56,460
I'm gonna take a drink.

1645
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:00,820
I think...

1646
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:03,120
I think that's what he looked like.

1647
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:03,500
Yeah.

1648
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:05,460
Uh...

1649
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:08,340
Okay, guys.

1650
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,720
I don't remember...

1651
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:12,140
What the abs look like, guys.

1652
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:13,540
I don't remember.

1653
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:17,440
I haven't watched a movie in so long.

1654
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:20,020
Or like...

1655
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:21,380
TV shows where they're...

1656
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,380
There's half naked men.

1657
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:24,740
Oh, look.

1658
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:26,540
The frosty flakes guy.

1659
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:28,720
Oh, God.

1660
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,040
I think that's what he looks like.

1661
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:30,380
Yeah.

1662
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:31,800
Okay, wait.

1663
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:32,680
Am I gonna color it?

1664
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:33,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1665
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:34,140
Okay.

1666
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:34,720
I'm done.

1667
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:35,460
You're done?

1668
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:36,060
Okay.

1669
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:37,000
Let me...

1670
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,420
I'll color it a little bit, too.

1671
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,700
I'll give it a little color.

1672
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:42,980
Okay, I stopped.

1673
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:44,160
I'm not gonna color it.

1674
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:46,000
It does not look great.

1675
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:46,960
It does not look great.

1676
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:47,200
All right.

1677
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:49,260
Give me a sec.

1678
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:49,620
Okay.

1679
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:50,580
Ready?

1680
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:52,620
Yeah.

1681
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:53,700
Hey.

1682
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:02,900
Oh, you got the face shape right.

1683
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:07,520
What does yours look like?

1684
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:09,580
It looks like a...

1685
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:12,780
What does he look like?

1686
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:15,360
Why does that your head looks like a cookie?

1687
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:18,480
I thought that was a trap on us.

1688
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:19,400
I don't know.

1689
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:21,700
Oh.

1690
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:23,140
Wait, did he have a cape?

1691
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:23,740
Oh, wow.

1692
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,720
He does have a cape.

1693
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:26,940
Oh, we got him right!

1694
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:27,980
Wait.

1695
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:28,780
He has a cape.

1696
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:29,740
Wait.

1697
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:30,700
You should look him up.

1698
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:31,020
Okay.

1699
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:31,720
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1700
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:33,820
That's him.

1701
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:34,060
Oh.

1702
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:35,980
Oh, and he is half naked.

1703
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:36,160
He did.

1704
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:37,300
Yeah.

1705
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:38,540
He has a mask on.

1706
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,740
Oh, so he didn't have...

1707
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:41,040
He didn't have shorts on.

1708
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:42,660
It was, like, skin tight.

1709
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:43,040
No, no.

1710
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:43,720
I didn't know that.

1711
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,720
I could not remember that at all.

1712
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,740
He had, like, skin tight...

1713
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:49,240
Skin tight pants on.

1714
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:51,960
No.

1715
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:52,840
I couldn't...

1716
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,720
I never would have guessed skin tight pants on.

1717
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:54,920
Yeah.

1718
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:56,760
For some reason, I always thought he had shorts on.

1719
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:58,800
It felt like he had...

1720
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,340
Oh, cuz my king had shorts on.

1721
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:01,980
Oh.

1722
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:03,340
Yeah.

1723
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:04,720
Custom king.

1724
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:06,620
That's why.

1725
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:07,400
Yeah.

1726
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:08,580
Yeah.

1727
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:09,540
Yeah.

1728
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:09,880
Yeah.

1729
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:11,860
I think...

1730
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:14,020
Yeah, mine's, like, tic-tac-toe abs.

1731
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:14,700
I...

1732
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:16,120
I did not...

1733
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,800
Did not remember what abs looked like.

1734
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,300
No, I got the same tic-tac-toe.

1735
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:22,340
Wait, no.

1736
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,340
Yours is literally tic-tac-toe.

1737
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,640
Mine is literally tic-tac-toe.

1738
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:29,760
Do you know there's a game where you can play online multiplayer tic-tac-toe?

1739
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,280
With, like, a group of people.

1740
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:31,860
Look at him play.

1741
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:32,400
Oh, my God.

1742
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,720
There's, like, there's this one where, like, you can tic-tac-toe within a tic-tac-toe square.

1743
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:37,940
So you battle...

1744
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:38,240
Yeah.

1745
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:40,460
That's, like, crazy.

1746
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:41,240
I was like...

1747
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:42,100
Cuz you can have, like...

1748
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:44,520
It can be, like, four people playing tic-tac-toe at the same time.

1749
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,960
So then, like...

1750
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:48,420
You have to win the tic-tac-toe within that square.

1751
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:51,720
To, like, win the square for your main tic-tac-toe.

1752
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,820
Oh, I was just thinking of this.

1753
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,380
Regular tic-tac-toe.

1754
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:00,760
It's like...

1755
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:03,340
It's like tic-tac-toe within a tic-tac-toe.

1756
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,540
That's too much for me.

1757
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:06,500
Too much tic-tac-toe.

1758
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:09,920
Too much tic-tac-toe-ing... Toes.

1759
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:10,840
Alright.

1760
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,040
Alright.

1761
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:13,920
Oh, is the alcoholic hitting you now?

1762
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:16,540
I'm almost done with this bottle.

1763
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:19,200
Wait, you never told me how much percentage it had.

1764
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,600
Oh my god, she's still going.

1765
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,340
She's still going!

1766
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:31,060
I'm sorry.

1767
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:34,680
I couldn't suction the thing.

1768
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,040
It was, like, stuck to the...

1769
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:41,330
How much is it?

1770
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:46,490
It's only, like... I think it's 7%.

1771
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:47,470
Oh, it's not that bad.

1772
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:48,770
It's not that bad, no.

1773
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:50,930
I thought it'd be more because it's sake.

1774
00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:53,190
It's not that bad.

1775
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:56,610
I would think it was, like, more because it's sake.

1776
00:50:56,790 --> 00:50:58,710
Isn't sake, like, more alcoholic?

1777
00:50:59,070 --> 00:51:00,010
I thought so, too.

1778
00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:00,390
Yeah.

1779
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:01,870
I guess because it's sparkling.

1780
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:07,390
So it diluted it a little bit because it's... They added, like, soda to it.

1781
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:09,250
It's delicious.

1782
00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:10,370
Oh my god.

1783
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:11,710
But what brand is it?

1784
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:14,210
Hana Hawaka.

1785
00:51:14,590 --> 00:51:15,490
That's really sick.

1786
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:15,530
That's really sick.

1787
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:16,350
That's really sick.

1788
00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:17,270
Ooh, I would, like, try that.

1789
00:51:17,470 --> 00:51:18,030
I wish I had soju too, man.

1790
00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:19,610
Yo, have you ever had lemon soju?

1791
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:23,430
Oh my god, I love lemon... I love, like, my favorite flavors are lemon soju.

1792
00:51:24,370 --> 00:51:25,410
Um... Peach soju.

1793
00:51:25,410 --> 00:51:25,410
What?

1794
00:51:25,410 --> 00:51:25,870
You had it already?

1795
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:26,530
Yeah!

1796
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:27,890
No, because, like, okay.

1797
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:39,030
Um, because, like, uh... Um, when I... Um, this is a little bit, like, lore behind personal life thing, but when I was growing up, I went to international school growing up.

1798
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:39,410
Mm-hmm.

1799
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:43,110
Like, and then, like, one of the international schools I went to was just all...

1800
00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:45,610
Mostly, like, 60% Korean student body.

1801
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:46,270
Yeah.

1802
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:48,430
So then they would, like, teach me about, like, Korean drinking.

1803
00:51:48,610 --> 00:51:49,810
Okay, I didn't underage drink.

1804
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:51,030
Did I?

1805
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:51,930
No, I didn't.

1806
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:52,170
No.

1807
00:51:54,950 --> 00:52:00,130
But when I turned 18, they took me, like, I met up with them in Korea and they, like, introduced me to soju.

1808
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:02,910
Oh... Yeah.

1809
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:10,610
Yeah, no, and then, like, it was, like... Because, like, soju is, like, so dangerous because, like, you can't taste the alcohol.

1810
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:11,630
At all.

1811
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:12,530
The fruit one, yes.

1812
00:52:12,850 --> 00:52:13,170
Yeah.

1813
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:14,230
It's very dangerous.

1814
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:14,650
Yes.

1815
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:20,870
Yeah, because, like, that was, like, when they, like, introduced me to lemon soju, I had, like, I think, like, six to seven shots.

1816
00:52:21,850 --> 00:52:22,070
Whoa.

1817
00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:23,930
Because I was, like, oh, man, it's so good.

1818
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:25,470
It tastes... It's so good.

1819
00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:26,850
I can't believe they only gave me so little.

1820
00:52:27,490 --> 00:52:29,390
Like, they gave me such a tiny little cup.

1821
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:29,810
Yeah, that's just juice.

1822
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:31,890
Yeah, it tastes just like juice.

1823
00:52:32,490 --> 00:52:33,290
And everything.

1824
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:35,030
But... Don't drink, kids.

1825
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:37,010
Yeah, don't drink and draw.

1826
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:38,010
I'm staying in school.

1827
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:39,370
Don't drink and draw.

1828
00:52:42,310 --> 00:52:46,540
Oh, my... If I... I don't have a car.

1829
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:47,960
But if I did, I had a car on my car.

1830
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,440
You wanted, like, a bumper sticker.

1831
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,760
And don't drink and draw, yes.

1832
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:52,860
Don't drink and draw.

1833
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,740
Someone's gonna make that in the merch now.

1834
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:56,800
Stay in school.

1835
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:04,140
Like, in, like, in, like, a couple of months, Lily's store is gonna have... Don't drink and draw.

1836
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:04,240
Don't drink and draw.

1837
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:05,860
And I'll be like, where's my royalties?

1838
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:07,060
Oh, God.

1839
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,140
Okay, your chat now.

1840
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:13,680
My chat.

1841
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:15,960
Draw responsibly.

1842
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:19,000
That's good.

1843
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:20,560
Draw responsibly.

1844
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:20,740
Draw responsibly.

1845
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:21,420
I like that one.

1846
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:23,800
Okay.

1847
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,400
Drawing under the influence.

1848
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:26,260
No.

1849
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:27,840
Do you lie?

1850
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:28,700
That's cute, dude.

1851
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:29,440
Alright.

1852
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:31,860
Give us a... It can... It can be anything.

1853
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,400
It can be anything.

1854
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:34,960
Anything.

1855
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:35,720
Anything.

1856
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:36,560
Anything at all.

1857
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:38,020
Anything that your heart desires.

1858
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:39,040
I don't know.

1859
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:39,660
You know?

1860
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:44,060
Alright, someone suggested Zengie, but I don't want to draw another half-naked man right now.

1861
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:45,020
No more, no more.

1862
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:46,480
No more.

1863
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:54,180
No more abs.

1864
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:57,060
No more tic-tac-toe abs.

1865
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:57,760
No more yipples.

1866
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:00,060
Oh, Sans Undertale.

1867
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:02,980
Okay.

1868
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:04,020
I got this.

1869
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,000
I got this.

1870
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:06,100
I love...

1871
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:07,240
What's my Sans voice?

1872
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:08,700
What's your Sans voice?

1873
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:21,960
Oh my god, I was like...

1874
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:26,360
My chat knows this, but I was like a huge Sans fan growing up.

1875
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:27,580
Just Sans though.

1876
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:29,640
None of the other characters.

1877
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,700
She's a skeleton?

1878
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:32,600
Yeah.

1879
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:34,380
Oh god, this is so...

1880
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:35,220
I don't remember.

1881
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:35,620
Oh.

1882
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:36,920
Skeleton.

1883
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:40,240
I should just draw a skeleton and it'll look like him, probably.

1884
00:54:43,290 --> 00:54:44,540
And then he...

1885
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,280
The thing is...

1886
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,560
I love Sans so much.

1887
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:57,820
I literally had like...

1888
00:54:57,820 --> 00:54:59,940
I had like a custom Sans doll.

1889
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,880
And like a custom ball-jointed Sans doll as well.

1890
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:09,420
Like a Sans plushie and a custom ball-jointed Sans...

1891
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:12,880
Figure I bought from a Korean artist.

1892
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:16,460
For some reason, Sans is incredibly popular in Korea.

1893
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:17,920
Just Sans though.

1894
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,680
Yeah, just Sans.

1895
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:21,620
So like...

1896
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:26,540
And they had like so much cool like custom shit from there.

1897
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:28,760
Okay, uh...

1898
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:30,220
Sans is a cool character.

1899
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:32,480
I love Undertale.

1900
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,060
I actually never...

1901
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:35,680
I never played Undertale.

1902
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:36,180
Oh!

1903
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:37,220
I like...

1904
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:39,780
The thing is, I watched so many playthroughs of it though.

1905
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:40,340
I don't know.

1906
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:41,300
Yeah.

1907
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:45,020
I watched so many playthroughs of it because that...

1908
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:45,920
So it's like...

1909
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,920
I feel like me playing it...

1910
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,880
I think I can't play it blind, you know?

1911
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:51,540
That's the worst part.

1912
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:52,560
Yeah, I mean, you already know what's gonna happen.

1913
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,520
Yeah, I already know what's gonna happen, so...

1914
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:57,740
I can't play it blind in general, so it's like, I felt like...

1915
00:55:57,740 --> 00:56:00,000
Because like, my chat would be like, Oh, when are you gonna try Undertale?

1916
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:00,660
But like, I...

1917
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:01,460
I can't.

1918
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:02,720
You already know everything.

1919
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:03,880
I know everything.

1920
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:04,320
I know everything.

1921
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:04,560
I like...

1922
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:05,280
I literally...

1923
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,700
I know every like...

1924
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:08,280
Uh...

1925
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:11,500
Ending possible that you can do and all the hidden secrets and everything.

1926
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:12,540
So it's like...

1927
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:14,540
I felt like there's no point in me playing it.

1928
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:17,640
I feel like the best experience is to play it blind.

1929
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:27,260
I feel like...

1930
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:28,800
Was his jacket zipped up?

1931
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:29,680
I don't know.

1932
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:31,160
I know it was a...

1933
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:33,940
He did have a jacket that looked like a winter...

1934
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:35,600
Yeah, I remember that.

1935
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:36,340
A winter's coat sort of thing.

1936
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:36,680
Yeah.

1937
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:38,080
I got that much.

1938
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,700
And then, he...

1939
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:41,220
You know, his eyes can...

1940
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:42,000
Glow.

1941
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:42,840
There's Hollow, right?

1942
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:45,780
There's Hollow, right?

1943
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:45,920
There's Hollow, what?

1944
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:47,040
Hollow.

1945
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:48,180
Hollow.

1946
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:49,380
Hollow?

1947
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,160
Hollow eyes, right?

1948
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:52,200
Hollow eyes?

1949
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:52,540
Yeah.

1950
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:53,780
Yeah, because he's a skeleton.

1951
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:55,060
He's a skeleton.

1952
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:56,620
But he had something in it.

1953
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:57,840
Remember when the...

1954
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:58,440
You know the fu...

1955
00:56:58,440 --> 00:56:58,920
Ah, fuck.

1956
00:56:59,080 --> 00:56:59,520
I can't...

1957
00:56:59,520 --> 00:56:59,860
Ah, fuck.

1958
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:00,780
Remember what?

1959
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,960
My communication skills are going down.

1960
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:04,780
Wait.

1961
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:05,940
The flame eyes.

1962
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,520
Yeah, the blue flame eyes.

1963
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:09,600
God damn it.

1964
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:10,640
Yeah.

1965
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:14,400
There's the flame eyes.

1966
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:15,760
Oh, yeah.

1967
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:21,000
And then...

1968
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,460
I don't remember what's going on with his arm.

1969
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,280
I don't think he had chicken.

1970
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:40,680
No.

1971
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:41,920
I don't...

1972
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:44,840
Do you have pants?

1973
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,740
Are you asking if he was...

1974
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:50,300
Yes, of course he had pants on.

1975
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,460
He had pants on?

1976
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:51,780
No.

1977
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:52,900
It was like shorts.

1978
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:54,500
Oh!

1979
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:55,220
It was shorts.

1980
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:56,340
You're so right.

1981
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:57,340
You are so right.

1982
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,420
It's coming back.

1983
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,440
It's like shorts and then...

1984
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:02,760
And then he was wearing slippers.

1985
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:03,540
Pink slippers.

1986
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:04,820
Yes.

1987
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:05,740
Yes.

1988
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:06,460
Nice.

1989
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:06,880
Okay.

1990
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:08,040
Okay, look.

1991
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:10,140
When I said I had a really, really...

1992
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:11,800
Deep obsession.

1993
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:14,720
Yeah, you're very oddly knowledgeable about his...

1994
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:16,100
Outfit.

1995
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:23,020
I had a very, very deep obsession over this character.

1996
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:26,060
You guys have no idea how bad it got.

1997
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,460
It was really cool.

1998
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:32,180
He was a pretty swell guy.

1999
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:33,500
He was a pretty swell guy.

2000
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:36,600
All right.

2001
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:36,980
I'm done.

2002
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:41,160
Same, same, same, same, same, same, same, same, same, same.

2003
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:41,600
I'm ready.

2004
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:42,460
Yeah.

2005
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:42,920
Yeah, yeah.

2006
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:44,820
3...

2007
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:44,960
Oh!

2008
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:45,280
Okay.

2009
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:46,500
I am so sorry.

2010
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,640
Oh, you gotta smile!

2011
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:50,720
Yeah, yeah!

2012
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:51,660
The, the little...

2013
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:53,200
The little oboe...

2014
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,600
Steven Universe smile.

2015
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:56,440
Dang.

2016
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:58,920
The smile.

2017
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:12,700
The only reason why I remember... Okay, this is... Okay, I don't know if I can tell this story because it's like... I don't remember how fucked up this picture is, so I... Wait, let me look it up real fast before I tell this story.

2018
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:15,340
Um... Oh, okay.

2019
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:16,420
Okay.

2020
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:26,040
The only reason why I remember what his smile looks like... Was because there's a really fucked up picture where, like...

2021
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:29,340
Okay, this is really bad.

2022
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:31,600
This is really bad.

2023
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:35,340
But, like... Um... You know Steven Universe, right?

2024
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:36,420
Uh-huh.

2025
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:46,080
So, like, people were saying that... There's, like... Sans was, like, basically... It's, like... Um... It's basically, like... There's a picture of... Oh, my gosh.

2026
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:46,520
I am drunk.

2027
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:55,900
There's a picture... There's a picture progression... Of Steven... Getting cancer... And his hair falling out...

2028
00:59:55,900 --> 01:00:07,780
And then... And then... And then he looks like Sans... And then... And then he looks like Sans... That's like... That's the only reason why... That's the only reason why... That's the only reason why I remember the smile... There's a game... There... Okay,

2029
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:09,420
I'll show you the picture... Okay.

2030
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:10,160
I'm sorry.

2031
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:10,660
I'm sorry.

2032
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:10,840
No.

2033
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:12,120
I'm sorry.

2034
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:13,500
No.

2035
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:14,220
I'm sorry.

2036
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:14,220
No.

2037
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:14,840
I'm sorry.

2038
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:15,500
No.

2039
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:15,520
I'm sorry.

2040
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:15,520
No.

2041
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:16,040
I'm sorry.

2042
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:16,040
No.

2043
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:16,680
I'm sorry.

2044
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:17,000
No.

2045
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:17,240
I'm sorry.

2046
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:17,500
No.

2047
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:17,520
I'm sorry.

2048
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:18,260
No.

2049
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:18,280
I'm sorry.

2050
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:18,280
No.

2051
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:18,280
I'm sorry.

2052
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:18,280
No.

2053
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:18,520
I'm sorry.

2054
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:18,620
No.

2055
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:18,620
I'm sorry.

2056
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:18,840
No.

2057
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:18,840
I'm sorry.

2058
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:19,100
No.

2059
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:19,100
I'm sorry.

2060
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:19,100
No.

2061
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:19,100
I'm sorry.

2062
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:19,100
No.

2063
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:19,100
I'm sorry.

2064
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:19,100
No.

2065
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:19,100
I'm sorry.

2066
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:19,100
No.

2067
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:19,100
I'm sorry.

2068
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:19,100
No.

2069
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:19,100
I'm sorry.

2070
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:19,180
No.

2071
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:19,480
I'm sorry.

2072
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:20,120
No.

2073
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:20,720
I'm sorry.

2074
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:21,680
No.

2075
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:22,820
I'm sorry.

2076
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:22,820
No.

2077
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:23,980
I'm sorry.

2078
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:24,680
No.

2079
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:28,180
I'm sorry Oh, no.

2080
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:31,120
Oh my god, I can kind of see it, but no.

2081
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:33,880
Because you're like, oh, the head.

2082
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:37,180
The head is basically Steven's head.

2083
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:42,820
Hey, what is this?

2084
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:46,820
Guys, this is what... This is what Sans looks like.

2085
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:47,900
Don't worry, guys.

2086
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,920
Oh yeah, and then this is... I forgot to show Lilies.

2087
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:54,260
You can tell the more drunk she is.

2088
01:00:54,260 --> 01:01:00,000
Don't worry, the image is starting to evolve in quality.

2089
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:01,120
Is that true?

2090
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:02,040
Wait, what?

2091
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:08,120
No, you can... Look at your second artwork and then compare it to Sans.

2092
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:10,900
Oh, this is great.

2093
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:13,320
Oh god.

2094
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:15,480
You can tell when the alcohol is starting to hit.

2095
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:18,640
Next suggestion, please.

2096
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:19,440
That's your chat.

2097
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:20,940
Oh, chat.

2098
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:23,160
Anything.

2099
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:24,660
Anything.

2100
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:26,100
Anything.

2101
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:28,620
Oh god.

2102
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:32,140
Okay, I like... Oh my god.

2103
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:32,760
Oh my god.

2104
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:34,360
Um...

2105
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:34,720
Yeah?

2106
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:35,400
What?

2107
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:36,360
What?

2108
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:39,680
There's so many.

2109
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:41,120
What is it?

2110
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:42,120
I'm just gonna pick one.

2111
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:43,620
Kirby with feet.

2112
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:49,160
Did you just say curvy with feet?

2113
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,040
Sorry, I was like the one that...

2114
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,920
Is that your... Okay, curvy with...

2115
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,960
I mean, we all know what curvy looks like.

2116
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:57,360
Yeah, this should be easy.

2117
01:01:57,740 --> 01:01:58,220
Yeah, this should be easy.

2118
01:01:58,480 --> 01:01:59,600
But like, what type of feet?

2119
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:00,340
Like the...

2120
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:00,600
Feet.

2121
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:02,980
But is it like the really detailed feet version?

2122
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:05,020
I think artist...

2123
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:06,520
I can't draw a circle.

2124
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:07,500
Artist interpretation.

2125
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:08,300
Okay.

2126
01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:09,640
Okay.

2127
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:10,560
I remember it.

2128
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:11,340
Cause I...

2129
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:11,900
There was...

2130
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:12,860
There was an art...

2131
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:14,420
I was like...

2132
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:16,100
My staff member was...

2133
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:17,900
Taking me around...

2134
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:18,300
Um...

2135
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:19,320
One of the artist alleys.

2136
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:21,160
I think it was like...

2137
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:23,120
Anime Expo or some shit.

2138
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:24,960
And then like...

2139
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:27,040
There's an artist that had the plushy of the...

2140
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:28,660
Very realistic human feet.

2141
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:29,080
Kirby.

2142
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:29,760
Mmm.

2143
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:33,600
And then...

2144
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:35,400
I can't draw feet.

2145
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:36,200
So I'm just gonna...

2146
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:38,300
I think it's...

2147
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:39,320
Gotta just...

2148
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:39,660
Uh...

2149
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:40,280
Yeah, that's...

2150
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:41,660
And then...

2151
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:42,960
Wait, what's the eye?

2152
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:43,660
Wait, okay.

2153
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,000
And then...

2154
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,540
I'll do this.

2155
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:48,120
This looks good.

2156
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:50,460
Uh...

2157
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:51,480
Wait.

2158
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:52,020
Tools.

2159
01:02:53,380 --> 01:02:54,180
Transparent.

2160
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,280
This should work.

2161
01:02:57,780 --> 01:02:58,520
Oh man.

2162
01:02:58,880 --> 01:02:59,640
This one's hard.

2163
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:02,020
Yeah, this one's very hard.

2164
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:05,260
I'll try hands.

2165
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:06,660
And then...

2166
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:07,480
And then...

2167
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:08,680
I'll do this.

2168
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,740
Wait, that's not transparent.

2169
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:18,020
I'm going to experiment.

2170
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:19,200
Here now.

2171
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:21,620
Let's get the one over here.

2172
01:03:21,620 --> 01:03:22,400
Um...

2173
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:24,340
Lower dungeon-y.

2174
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:26,040
No, that doesn't work.

2175
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:28,460
And then, like, blend it in.

2176
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:29,480
Okay.

2177
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:30,580
And then...

2178
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:30,740
Oh, good.

2179
01:03:30,820 --> 01:03:31,680
I did the wrong one.

2180
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:32,240
There you go.

2181
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:34,700
Yeah, that's fine.

2182
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:35,160
That's fine.

2183
01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:35,320
That's fine.

2184
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:35,800
This is fine.

2185
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:36,720
This works.

2186
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:39,540
And then...

2187
01:03:40,540 --> 01:03:41,880
I figured it out.

2188
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:50,840
I think this is my best drawing yet.

2189
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:51,020
I think this is my best drawing yet.

2190
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:51,360
What about you?

2191
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:51,680
No.

2192
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:53,100
I...

2193
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:54,500
I'm inclined to agree.

2194
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:54,620
Okay.

2195
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:01,320
They got this.

2196
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,500
This definitely looks like Kirby.

2197
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:07,200
You know what?

2198
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,140
Kirby, why are you looking so fine?

2199
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:10,640
I'm so proud of this.

2200
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:18,980
Why are you looking so fine?

2201
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:23,040
You know what?

2202
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:24,420
I got...

2203
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:24,980
Oh...

2204
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:26,080
Kirby!

2205
01:04:26,540 --> 01:04:27,380
What's that?

2206
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:28,140
Whoa!

2207
01:04:29,860 --> 01:04:30,300
Okay.

2208
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:32,080
You know what?

2209
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:32,360
You're right.

2210
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:33,420
I'm gonna shade too.

2211
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:35,980
I'm going to give you what you want.

2212
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:38,660
I'm giving the people what they want.

2213
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:42,380
But...

2214
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:43,240
You know what?

2215
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:44,220
I'm shading too.

2216
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:45,340
For the people.

2217
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:46,800
Gonna add some details too.

2218
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:49,480
This is the most detailed drawing I've done so far.

2219
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:50,300
Me too.

2220
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:50,960
I agree.

2221
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:52,540
Okay, okay.

2222
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:54,420
I'm down to spend a little bit more time on it.

2223
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:54,680
Me too, yeah.

2224
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:56,600
Cause I just don't think I can rush this kind of art.

2225
01:04:56,740 --> 01:04:57,260
You're right.

2226
01:04:57,540 --> 01:04:58,280
You're so right.

2227
01:04:58,820 --> 01:04:59,260
Like...

2228
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:00,020
I feel like...

2229
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:01,160
I could sell this.

2230
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:02,720
Oh yeah.

2231
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:04,160
Oh yeah.

2232
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:07,440
I gotta zoom in on that.

2233
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:09,300
And then...

2234
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:09,600
You know what?

2235
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:10,940
I'm gonna do the background too.

2236
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:12,660
Oh my god.

2237
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:13,500
You're going hard.

2238
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:13,700
Yeah.

2239
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:14,540
I'm going hard.

2240
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:15,000
Yeah.

2241
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:16,560
I'm gonna go.

2242
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:17,780
Oh.

2243
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:18,140
Okay.

2244
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:18,860
This is...

2245
01:05:18,860 --> 01:05:19,400
Okay.

2246
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:19,980
Okay.

2247
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:21,220
Alright.

2248
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:22,220
Oh.

2249
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:23,560
What's that, Kirby?

2250
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,060
You want nail polish?

2251
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:32,080
Are you giving him eyelashes?

2252
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,420
I'll do what you want, Kirby.

2253
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:41,200
Anything you want, baby girl.

2254
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:41,640
Anything.

2255
01:05:42,060 --> 01:05:42,880
Are you...

2256
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:44,620
Are you pimping out, Kirby?

2257
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:45,080
No.

2258
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,300
My eyes are watery.

2259
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:50,140
Are you pimping out, Kirby?

2260
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:54,480
Axe those poles, Kirby.

2261
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,160
My eyes are just really watery.

2262
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:58,140
Axe those poles, Kirby.

2263
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:01,940
I'm gonna...

2264
01:06:01,940 --> 01:06:02,980
Ow, it's burning.

2265
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:03,160
Drink.

2266
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:04,720
Don't worry.

2267
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:05,300
Wash my face.

2268
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:05,580
Okay.

2269
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:07,680
He said...

2270
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:09,200
He's just having a good time.

2271
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:10,060
Hang out.

2272
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:11,820
And then there's the sun.

2273
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:17,100
I'm so sorry.

2274
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:25,840
Oh yeah, I forgot.

2275
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:26,920
I forgot.

2276
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:27,540
I forgot to...

2277
01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:29,100
Make sure the feet's red.

2278
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:30,040
Give me a sec.

2279
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:32,500
Don't worry.

2280
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:34,080
I got you guys.

2281
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:44,100
I think it's God's way of telling me to stop.

2282
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:45,100
I got it.

2283
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:46,220
I won't...

2284
01:06:46,220 --> 01:06:46,900
Wait, but no.

2285
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:47,720
It should be pink.

2286
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:48,080
Yes.

2287
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:48,820
I remember.

2288
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:50,240
It's like pinkish too.

2289
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:52,180
I am demoted.

2290
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:53,440
Make it more pinkish.

2291
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:54,020
Ooh.

2292
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:55,120
That's actually better.

2293
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:56,480
Cause it's like more...

2294
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:57,320
To...

2295
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:59,080
It fits to skin tone more.

2296
01:06:59,600 --> 01:06:59,960
There you go.

2297
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:00,380
I'm ready.

2298
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:01,680
A little bush.

2299
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:03,060
Okay.

2300
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:04,620
Are you ready?

2301
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:05,720
Okay.

2302
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:06,520
Give me a sec.

2303
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:07,680
Let me...

2304
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:10,080
Let me snip this for you.

2305
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:10,220
Two.

2306
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:14,000
Okay, ready.

2307
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:14,380
Okay.

2308
01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:15,420
Here we go.

2309
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:16,680
Alright.

2310
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:18,900
Three...

2311
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:19,280
Oh, okay.

2312
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:19,760
Oh, sorry.

2313
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:23,380
Oh my god.

2314
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:24,180
Okay.

2315
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:25,800
She went literal.

2316
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:31,020
Dude, where did you find those feet?

2317
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:33,340
I googled...

2318
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:34,340
Bare feet...

2319
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:35,560
PNG.

2320
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:38,540
Oh...

2321
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:41,200
Oh my god.

2322
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:41,940
Did you...

2323
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:42,100
Thank you.

2324
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,660
You gave her fishnets?

2325
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:45,480
You gave...

2326
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:46,500
Yeah, she was...

2327
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:47,480
She wanted it.

2328
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:49,560
She wanted it.

2329
01:07:50,620 --> 01:07:51,620
Holy shit.

2330
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:52,940
Alright, guys.

2331
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:53,540
This is...

2332
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:55,160
This is...

2333
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:57,020
Have you ever seen that picture though?

2334
01:07:57,180 --> 01:07:58,260
The bare feet curvy?

2335
01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:01,280
Bare feet curvy...

2336
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:01,540
Let me...

2337
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:02,080
I think I did.

2338
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:02,480
Hold on.

2339
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:06,220
Oh yeah, I've seen this.

2340
01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:06,760
Yeah, yeah.

2341
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:07,960
It is.

2342
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:10,520
There's a plushie of this?

2343
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:11,200
Are you serious?

2344
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:11,500
Yes, I saw...

2345
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:12,910
I saw someone have...

2346
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:15,680
Like, put that plushie in at Artist Alley.

2347
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:18,120
And I wanted to buy it so badly.

2348
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:19,320
Oh my god.

2349
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:19,560
Wait.

2350
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:20,000
You're...

2351
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,360
You're bare feet curvy?

2352
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:22,060
Oh my god.

2353
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:22,900
I wonder if I...

2354
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:23,640
Okay.

2355
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:25,820
I drew something very similar to this.

2356
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:26,980
It's...

2357
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:27,900
Okay.

2358
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:28,960
I don't know if I...

2359
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:29,520
Okay, let me see.

2360
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:31,180
It's...

2361
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:32,700
Okay, let me see if I can find it.

2362
01:08:33,140 --> 01:08:34,540
Guys, is it still on my Twitter?

2363
01:08:34,540 --> 01:08:35,620
Is it...

2364
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:36,960
Is it...

2365
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:37,700
That's the question.

2366
01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:39,320
Is it still on my Twitter?

2367
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:40,420
But...

2368
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:41,920
I will look for...

2369
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:42,540
Doki Bird...

2370
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:44,440
Bare Feet.

2371
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:44,760
No!

2372
01:08:44,980 --> 01:08:45,020
No!

2373
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:45,340
No!

2374
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:45,920
No!

2375
01:08:46,180 --> 01:08:46,400
No!

2376
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:49,720
Wait a minute!

2377
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:50,620
No, don't...

2378
01:08:50,620 --> 01:08:51,640
Don't look!

2379
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:52,860
Don't look!

2380
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:53,820
Don't look at that!

2381
01:08:55,660 --> 01:08:57,240
Doki, what is this?

2382
01:08:57,640 --> 01:08:58,120
No!

2383
01:08:58,940 --> 01:08:59,240
No!

2384
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:00,140
No, no, no!

2385
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:00,780
No, stop!

2386
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:01,700
Stop!

2387
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:03,600
I didn't mean it like that!

2388
01:09:03,980 --> 01:09:05,700
I didn't mean it...

2389
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:05,920
Okay.

2390
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:06,800
Okay.

2391
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:07,200
Okay.

2392
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:07,400
Okay.

2393
01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:08,560
This was...

2394
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:10,220
I said stop!

2395
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:11,520
I said stop!

2396
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:13,020
You didn't stop!

2397
01:09:13,660 --> 01:09:15,320
That is your fault!

2398
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:16,410
I said stop!

2399
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:18,460
I said stop!

2400
01:09:18,460 --> 01:09:19,060
I'm so many more!

2401
01:09:19,340 --> 01:09:20,660
There's so many more!

2402
01:09:23,820 --> 01:09:24,360
Wait!

2403
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:25,240
Wait!

2404
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:26,120
Are you on that?

2405
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:27,480
Okay, this is...

2406
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:28,600
Okay, can I...

2407
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:29,880
Okay, I'm gonna say it.

2408
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:30,480
I have an excuse.

2409
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:31,280
Are you on...

2410
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:33,920
You know that website where it's like live streamers...

2411
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,280
Twitch live streamers...

2412
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:36,420
Feet dick like...

2413
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:37,760
Feet Thesaurus or whatever?

2414
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:39,000
Where it's just...

2415
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:39,740
Oh, you mean wiki feet?

2416
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:41,020
Yeah, wiki feet?

2417
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:41,900
Are you...

2418
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:45,000
Are you asking if I'm on wiki?

2419
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:49,580
I...

2420
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:50,680
I don't wanna know.

2421
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:52,000
If I am...

2422
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,780
I think I am.

2423
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:55,740
I don't wanna know.

2424
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:56,980
You don't wanna...

2425
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:58,140
I don't know.

2426
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:58,980
I don't even have...

2427
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:00,080
Okay, honest...

2428
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:01,300
I don't think I have like...

2429
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:04,020
Nice looking feet in particular.

2430
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:04,560
Yeah.

2431
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:06,260
So I always wear socks and stuff.

2432
01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:07,160
And like...

2433
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:07,540
I don't know.

2434
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:10,460
I think my big toe is a little too big.

2435
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:13,420
Big toe!

2436
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:13,860
Big toe!

2437
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:15,420
A little too big!

2438
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:18,380
God.

2439
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:18,760
Okay.

2440
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:19,520
Oh.

2441
01:10:19,780 --> 01:10:19,960
Wait.

2442
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:20,360
Okay.

2443
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:20,780
Okay, wait.

2444
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:21,540
I need to find...

2445
01:10:21,540 --> 01:10:21,680
Okay.

2446
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:22,840
I...

2447
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:22,960
Okay.

2448
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:23,960
Apparently...

2449
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:25,040
Apparently...

2450
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:28,240
This particular artwork that I drew...

2451
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:30,200
Is still on my Twitter account.

2452
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:30,780
But...

2453
01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:32,860
I don't remember...

2454
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:33,720
I can't...

2455
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:34,340
Like...

2456
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:35,160
I have...

2457
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:36,740
I found the sketch of it.

2458
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:37,700
But...

2459
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:39,060
I think...

2460
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:40,820
I found the sketch.

2461
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:42,800
But I colored it...

2462
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:43,990
Like I actually drew...

2463
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:46,760
Colored it and finished it up a long time ago.

2464
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:49,560
But I don't remember where it went.

2465
01:10:50,220 --> 01:10:50,960
I...

2466
01:10:51,610 --> 01:10:52,300
It's okay.

2467
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:53,280
This was...

2468
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:54,700
Five years ago.

2469
01:10:56,940 --> 01:10:57,660
Oh!

2470
01:10:59,980 --> 01:11:01,900
Oh my god, is that...

2471
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:03,000
Is that...

2472
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,300
Is...

2473
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:05,640
What's the...

2474
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:05,720
Two hanging...

2475
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:06,220
It's the blobfish.

2476
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:06,600
It's the blobfish.

2477
01:11:06,620 --> 01:11:07,040
Two hanging...

2478
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:07,500
Two hanging...

2479
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:08,280
So...

2480
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:09,700
I drew this...

2481
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:10,740
Um...

2482
01:11:10,740 --> 01:11:11,800
Five years ago.

2483
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:12,780
Let's see it.

2484
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:13,600
When I used to draw.

2485
01:11:13,940 --> 01:11:14,580
When I...

2486
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:16,440
What is that?

2487
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:17,320
It could...

2488
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:18,680
It could be anything, really.

2489
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:19,300
It could be.

2490
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:20,160
It could be.

2491
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:21,580
It's like Curbio with feet.

2492
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:24,640
Wow, it's beautiful.

2493
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:25,580
Thank you.

2494
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:29,920
See, you can tell when I stopped drawing and what happened to me.

2495
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:30,940
I love this.

2496
01:11:32,140 --> 01:11:33,460
This is beautiful.

2497
01:11:34,340 --> 01:11:35,680
This should be a sticker.

2498
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:36,440
I love it.

2499
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:38,100
No, I did sell it as a sticker.

2500
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:38,740
That's the thing.

2501
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:39,520
Oh my god.

2502
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:40,720
Sell it again.

2503
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:43,960
This is... I don't know where it is.

2504
01:11:44,140 --> 01:11:47,880
It's... Okay, maybe... Maybe I can find this.

2505
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:48,520
Wait, okay.

2506
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,020
Let me scroll down my Twitter.

2507
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:51,980
I think I can find this.

2508
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:53,800
I did not tweet a lot.

2509
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:54,640
I'm pretty sure.

2510
01:11:55,860 --> 01:11:57,260
There's... Okay, I'm scrolling.

2511
01:11:57,820 --> 01:11:58,600
I'm scrolling.

2512
01:11:58,780 --> 01:12:00,740
I think I sold it as a... No, I did.

2513
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:01,780
I did.

2514
01:12:01,780 --> 01:12:05,140
I remember selling it because I used to do Artist Alley stuff.

2515
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:07,160
Oh, Artist Alley.

2516
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:07,500
Yeah.

2517
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:11,460
Oh, you did art... I remember you did Artist Alley too at TwitchCon.

2518
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:13,120
I'm trying it out.

2519
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:14,960
It's cute and fun.

2520
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:16,240
You make little cute stuff.

2521
01:12:17,180 --> 01:12:27,940
Oh... Also, guys... I can't... I forgot that since Twitter became X, you can't scroll past a certain point.

2522
01:12:28,060 --> 01:12:29,480
Oh my god, you're right.

2523
01:12:29,620 --> 01:12:31,960
I forgot about it.

2524
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:33,200
Wait, guys.

2525
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:40,940
Surely somebody remembers the blobfish... The blobfish... Sexy blobfish art I drew.

2526
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:45,580
And someone can, like, find that tweet and then at me.

2527
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:49,220
It's my own tweet, but it's not just at me.

2528
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:55,780
So it'll be back off my search history.

2529
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:57,660
Oh, yeah.

2530
01:12:58,140 --> 01:12:59,760
I deleted my search history.

2531
01:13:00,820 --> 01:13:02,520
A little bad idea.

2532
01:13:02,860 --> 01:13:03,620
I told you to stop.

2533
01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:04,680
I don't know what I was thinking, man.

2534
01:13:05,260 --> 01:13:07,240
I told you to stop.

2535
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:09,120
I just thought, you know.

2536
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:12,980
I mean, I guess... Typing in Doki...

2537
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:16,500
That was not the smartest...

2538
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:17,100
I don't know what I was thinking.

2539
01:13:17,380 --> 01:13:18,860
I don't know what I was thinking.

2540
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:21,920
No, I liked...

2541
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:23,000
I liked old...

2542
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,920
Old Doki's...

2543
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:27,220
Brushes and...

2544
01:13:27,220 --> 01:13:28,000
Oh, man, I missed...

2545
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,360
I missed this brush.

2546
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:30,760
That was such a good brush.

2547
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,160
That was my go-to brush for sketching.

2548
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:34,400
I mean, I'm just...

2549
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:36,700
Did you only draw in, uh, Paint Tool Sai?

2550
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:38,740
Yeah, I only draw in Paint Tool Sai.

2551
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:39,960
Mmm.

2552
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:41,240
It was my...

2553
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:42,740
It was my safe place.

2554
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:44,980
I'm gonna steal my...

2555
01:13:46,180 --> 01:13:48,980
I'm gonna steal Old Doki's, like, color palette.

2556
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:50,920
I'm gonna delete this.

2557
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:52,160
Ha ha ha.

2558
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:54,680
Delete Kirby.

2559
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:55,820
Ha ha ha.

2560
01:13:58,080 --> 01:13:59,900
It has to be undone.

2561
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:01,240
Goodbye, Kirby!

2562
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:03,200
Alright,

2563
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:06,820
guys.

2564
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:08,200
Suggest...

2565
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:08,840
It's my turn.

2566
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:12,120
Suggest me... Oh, wait, they found it.

2567
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:13,740
That was... No, no, not the sketch, guys.

2568
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:14,660
The finished one.

2569
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:18,760
The finished version where it's fully colored and everything.

2570
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:19,840
And he's pink.

2571
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:21,400
And fully shaded.

2572
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:24,860
Because I remembered it was fully colored.

2573
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:26,200
Okay.

2574
01:14:26,580 --> 01:14:27,380
My turn.

2575
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:29,640
Suggesting... Suggesting...

2576
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:33,720
Uh... Give me... Give us... Give us a character.

2577
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:38,880
Any character.

2578
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:42,620
Oh, someone's... Oh, since you're playing a horse game.

2579
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:45,940
We should do... Gold shit.

2580
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Gold... Oh, god.

2581
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:49,680
Off the top of my head's gonna be hard.

2582
01:14:49,820 --> 01:14:49,920
Okay.

2583
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:50,880
Yeah, me too.

2584
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:51,200
Wait.

2585
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:53,320
Guys, describe gold shit for us.

2586
01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:54,320
Actually, don't.

2587
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:56,040
I don't even play the game.

2588
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:00,140
I don't... I've seen it all over.

2589
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:01,460
I've seen it all over.

2590
01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:02,220
Twitter.

2591
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:03,200
Oh, gold shit.

2592
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:03,700
Okay.

2593
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:04,360
Gold shit.

2594
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:06,760
Oh, I found... They found... They found it.

2595
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:08,200
They found the colored version.

2596
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:08,540
Okay.

2597
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:08,780
Wait.

2598
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:09,800
I need to show you this before.

2599
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:11,100
They found it.

2600
01:15:12,220 --> 01:15:13,720
That's... Wow, that's cursed.

2601
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:14,920
That's cursed.

2602
01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:18,580
You're gonna say that's cute or something?

2603
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:19,860
No, that's just cursed.

2604
01:15:19,860 --> 01:15:21,600
You're like rubbing it up.

2605
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:28,740
You're... Oh, wait.

2606
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:29,960
I can put it on top of your head.

2607
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:32,920
You don't get... Okay.

2608
01:15:37,590 --> 01:15:38,130
Wait.

2609
01:15:38,570 --> 01:15:40,270
I can pin this on you.

2610
01:15:40,490 --> 01:15:40,670
Wait.

2611
01:15:41,230 --> 01:15:41,650
Okay.

2612
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:42,630
You don't gotta do that.

2613
01:15:42,830 --> 01:15:47,530
You don't gotta... How is this worse?

2614
01:15:48,290 --> 01:15:48,630
Yes.

2615
01:15:49,050 --> 01:15:50,510
How is this worse?

2616
01:15:50,810 --> 01:15:50,950
Yes.

2617
01:15:50,950 --> 01:15:50,950
How is this worse?

2618
01:15:50,950 --> 01:15:52,070
Like no other said.

2619
01:15:58,830 --> 01:16:04,730
This is... If I stopped... If I didn't stop being in our... Like... If I didn't stop driving...

2620
01:16:04,730 --> 01:16:10,490
And became a VTuber... I... I basically... You know, I wasted my talents.

2621
01:16:10,890 --> 01:16:18,290
I... I can't believe... I can't believe... I stopped... You know, no.

2622
01:16:18,370 --> 01:16:19,330
I stopped at the right time.

2623
01:16:19,430 --> 01:16:20,330
This was my peak art.

2624
01:16:20,670 --> 01:16:22,050
This was actually peak right there.

2625
01:16:22,410 --> 01:16:24,170
I could never replicate this again.

2626
01:16:24,770 --> 01:16:26,750
Is that the best thing you've ever drawn?

2627
01:16:26,750 --> 01:16:26,750
Yeah.

2628
01:16:26,930 --> 01:16:28,730
This is honestly the best thing I've ever drawn.

2629
01:16:28,730 --> 01:16:36,430
Honestly, this is... I feel like... I feel like I could never do anything better than this.

2630
01:16:36,610 --> 01:16:37,730
You know, I'm retweeting this.

2631
01:16:37,870 --> 01:16:43,690
I'm... This artwork deserved more than 100 likes back then.

2632
01:16:46,010 --> 01:16:49,350
Um... I honestly... Honestly... I retweeted it.

2633
01:16:49,590 --> 01:16:49,990
Retweeted it.

2634
01:16:50,090 --> 01:16:51,030
I retweeted it.

2635
01:16:51,210 --> 01:16:51,550
Nine.

2636
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:52,130
Nine.

2637
01:16:52,170 --> 01:16:52,290
Nine.

2638
01:16:53,410 --> 01:16:58,590
Five years ago, Doki would be so proud to see this artwork get attention it deserves.

2639
01:16:58,730 --> 01:16:59,470
All right.

2640
01:17:04,210 --> 01:17:07,430
Five... Five years ago, Doki would have been so proud of me.

2641
01:17:08,510 --> 01:17:14,070
Using my... Using my current fame to advertise my old art.

2642
01:17:16,110 --> 01:17:16,750
Okay, wait.

2643
01:17:16,850 --> 01:17:16,990
Oh, yeah.

2644
01:17:17,150 --> 01:17:17,750
It's pretty good.

2645
01:17:18,090 --> 01:17:20,070
I would... I would get a sticker of this.

2646
01:17:20,290 --> 01:17:21,170
It's... I liked it a lot.

2647
01:17:21,170 --> 01:17:21,190
I did.

2648
01:17:21,330 --> 01:17:23,030
I did make stickers out of this.

2649
01:17:23,330 --> 01:17:24,530
I would... I would resell this.

2650
01:17:24,650 --> 01:17:25,030
Okay, guys.

2651
01:17:25,030 --> 01:17:25,490
You should.

2652
01:17:25,490 --> 01:17:29,050
If I put this on my merch store, would you guys buy...

2653
01:17:29,050 --> 01:17:30,770
Of course they'd buy it.

2654
01:17:31,050 --> 01:17:32,550
A Doki Fruit original?

2655
01:17:33,090 --> 01:17:33,370
All right.

2656
01:17:33,430 --> 01:17:36,430
I'll tell Gamer... GamerSubs to put this as a sticker.

2657
01:17:37,070 --> 01:17:42,830
I... I'll tell... I'll tell GamerSubs to put this as a sticker.

2658
01:17:43,890 --> 01:17:45,010
Are you sure?

2659
01:17:45,510 --> 01:17:46,070
Yes.

2660
01:17:46,790 --> 01:17:47,350
Yes.

2661
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:47,750
Yes.

2662
01:17:49,210 --> 01:17:49,570
Please.

2663
01:17:50,110 --> 01:17:51,850
When you do... Can you send me one?

2664
01:17:52,070 --> 01:17:52,370
Oh, yeah.

2665
01:17:52,450 --> 01:17:52,610
Yeah.

2666
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:53,470
I'll send... Will you... Wait.

2667
01:17:53,530 --> 01:17:55,270
Will you... Where will you stick it?

2668
01:17:56,310 --> 01:17:56,990
Oh, God.

2669
01:17:57,210 --> 01:17:58,670
I got... You gotta let me think about...

2670
01:17:58,670 --> 01:18:00,630
Would you stick it in the back of your phone?

2671
01:18:01,570 --> 01:18:03,210
No, I would put it in Michael's garage.

2672
01:18:03,410 --> 01:18:05,130
But somewhere where he'll come across it one day.

2673
01:18:05,290 --> 01:18:05,910
Oh, my God.

2674
01:18:06,090 --> 01:18:07,030
Yes, you should.

2675
01:18:07,470 --> 01:18:10,950
Didn't you do like a... What was... I saw a video like where you painted...

2676
01:18:10,950 --> 01:18:11,150
Babies?

2677
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:12,530
The... The... Sorry.

2678
01:18:12,690 --> 01:18:12,770
No.

2679
01:18:12,770 --> 01:18:13,890
The... The... What?

2680
01:18:14,830 --> 01:18:15,350
No.

2681
01:18:15,470 --> 01:18:15,630
No, no, no.

2682
01:18:15,670 --> 01:18:15,810
It's good.

2683
01:18:15,970 --> 01:18:16,250
No, no.

2684
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:16,690
Can I explain?

2685
01:18:16,850 --> 01:18:17,350
Can I explain?

2686
01:18:18,170 --> 01:18:20,110
What about the babies?

2687
01:18:20,530 --> 01:18:20,670
No.

2688
01:18:20,830 --> 01:18:21,010
No.

2689
01:18:21,190 --> 01:18:23,910
I... I... I bought tiny little babies from Amazon.

2690
01:18:24,310 --> 01:18:25,150
And hit them everywhere.

2691
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:25,550
Dude.

2692
01:18:25,810 --> 01:18:26,730
Oh, my God.

2693
01:18:26,950 --> 01:18:27,310
Contact.

2694
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:29,390
Holy shit.

2695
01:18:29,570 --> 01:18:29,590
Okay.

2696
01:18:29,590 --> 01:18:30,050
The babies?

2697
01:18:32,990 --> 01:18:34,230
That was close.

2698
01:18:35,090 --> 01:18:36,750
I was gonna say like...

2699
01:18:36,750 --> 01:18:38,730
I was gonna say like...

2700
01:18:38,730 --> 01:18:41,830
Like... You're... You're... The mural you did on this garage.

2701
01:18:41,830 --> 01:18:42,010
Oh, my God.

2702
01:18:42,150 --> 01:18:44,410
I was gonna talk about that.

2703
01:18:44,710 --> 01:18:45,690
Not... That is bad.

2704
01:18:45,830 --> 01:18:47,290
Not the big babies.

2705
01:18:49,730 --> 01:18:50,510
Yeah, no, no.

2706
01:18:50,770 --> 01:18:51,270
Big babies.

2707
01:18:55,330 --> 01:18:57,670
Yeah, I'll send... I'll send you like...

2708
01:18:57,670 --> 01:18:58,790
Like... Like...

2709
01:18:58,790 --> 01:19:00,670
Like... You know, like a fistful...

2710
01:19:00,670 --> 01:19:02,410
Of stickers so that he can put it everywhere.

2711
01:19:02,870 --> 01:19:03,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2712
01:19:03,070 --> 01:19:03,710
And that's where I can put it.

2713
01:19:03,790 --> 01:19:05,030
Yeah, and then like... You know, like...

2714
01:19:05,030 --> 01:19:08,130
Where like Michael would like open a random drawer and then it'll just be there.

2715
01:19:10,270 --> 01:19:11,350
He's gonna hate it.

2716
01:19:11,350 --> 01:19:13,510
Maybe like... Like... Like...

2717
01:19:13,510 --> 01:19:16,410
Five years later, he's still trying... He's still finding you.

2718
01:19:16,670 --> 01:19:17,770
That's the dream.

2719
01:19:18,210 --> 01:19:19,470
That's the dream, baby.

2720
01:19:20,230 --> 01:19:21,130
That's the dream.

2721
01:19:22,470 --> 01:19:22,950
Okay.

2722
01:19:23,210 --> 01:19:23,370
Wait.

2723
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:24,270
What were... Oh, my gold ship.

2724
01:19:24,410 --> 01:19:25,810
I was the one that suggested it.

2725
01:19:26,510 --> 01:19:26,930
Um...

2726
01:19:26,930 --> 01:19:27,130
Wait.

2727
01:19:27,310 --> 01:19:28,810
Can you describe gold ship to me?

2728
01:19:29,590 --> 01:19:29,990
Okay.

2729
01:19:30,230 --> 01:19:31,250
Gold ship...

2730
01:19:32,270 --> 01:19:32,750
Wait.

2731
01:19:32,910 --> 01:19:33,670
Look it up.

2732
01:19:33,870 --> 01:19:34,050
Alright.

2733
01:19:34,150 --> 01:19:35,010
Finish drying your...

2734
01:19:35,870 --> 01:19:36,350
Wait.

2735
01:19:36,350 --> 01:19:38,090
She's a tall girl horse.

2736
01:19:38,090 --> 01:19:38,930
She has...

2737
01:19:38,930 --> 01:19:40,250
White silver hair.

2738
01:19:40,430 --> 01:19:41,170
Front bangs.

2739
01:19:41,710 --> 01:19:42,350
Ponytail.

2740
01:19:42,610 --> 01:19:43,370
Horse ears.

2741
01:19:43,630 --> 01:19:43,870
Okay.

2742
01:19:44,630 --> 01:19:44,850
Okay.

2743
01:19:44,850 --> 01:19:45,650
She kicks a lot.

2744
01:19:46,990 --> 01:19:47,630
Um...

2745
01:19:48,410 --> 01:19:49,050
Okay.

2746
01:19:49,730 --> 01:19:50,790
And she's...

2747
01:19:50,790 --> 01:19:50,890
Wait.

2748
01:19:50,990 --> 01:19:51,850
What is her hairstyle?

2749
01:19:53,590 --> 01:19:54,710
Front bangs, I think.

2750
01:19:54,810 --> 01:19:56,810
And she has a high pony...

2751
01:19:56,810 --> 01:19:58,970
I think...

2752
01:19:58,970 --> 01:19:59,750
Oh, but like...

2753
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:01,450
Front...

2754
01:20:01,790 --> 01:20:02,110
High...

2755
01:20:02,110 --> 01:20:02,990
Oh, so it's a ponytail.

2756
01:20:03,770 --> 01:20:04,090
Okay.

2757
01:20:04,470 --> 01:20:04,570
Yeah.

2758
01:20:04,890 --> 01:20:05,190
Wait.

2759
01:20:05,290 --> 01:20:05,330
No.

2760
01:20:05,370 --> 01:20:06,030
Is it a ponytail?

2761
01:20:07,230 --> 01:20:07,550
Wait.

2762
01:20:07,630 --> 01:20:08,270
It's not a ponytail.

2763
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:09,210
It's like down.

2764
01:20:09,530 --> 01:20:10,210
She has a hat.

2765
01:20:10,390 --> 01:20:11,110
Oh, it's not...

2766
01:20:11,110 --> 01:20:11,170
Wait.

2767
01:20:11,250 --> 01:20:11,450
Hold on.

2768
01:20:11,650 --> 01:20:11,790
Hold on.

2769
01:20:11,910 --> 01:20:12,150
I'm gonna think...

2770
01:20:12,150 --> 01:20:13,970
Am I thinking of the wrong character, guys?

2771
01:20:14,710 --> 01:20:15,950
Chad, does she have a ponytail?

2772
01:20:16,570 --> 01:20:17,330
Please tell me.

2773
01:20:17,470 --> 01:20:18,490
I can't think right now.

2774
01:20:18,930 --> 01:20:19,230
Wait.

2775
01:20:19,230 --> 01:20:20,570
What does the hat look like?

2776
01:20:21,430 --> 01:20:23,290
The hat is like...

2777
01:20:23,290 --> 01:20:24,750
A tiny...

2778
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:25,850
It's like...

2779
01:20:25,850 --> 01:20:26,270
What does...

2780
01:20:26,270 --> 01:20:27,690
What does the hat look like?

2781
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:29,450
It's between her ears!

2782
01:20:30,010 --> 01:20:31,150
What does that mean?

2783
01:20:31,550 --> 01:20:31,770
Yeah!

2784
01:20:33,250 --> 01:20:34,250
No ponytail.

2785
01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:35,870
She does not have a ponytail.

2786
01:20:36,230 --> 01:20:36,530
Okay.

2787
01:20:36,890 --> 01:20:37,250
Okay.

2788
01:20:38,470 --> 01:20:39,030
Um...

2789
01:20:40,110 --> 01:20:40,930
What else?

2790
01:20:41,690 --> 01:20:43,750
She has an earmuff things, I remember.

2791
01:20:43,930 --> 01:20:44,130
Oh, yeah.

2792
01:20:44,190 --> 01:20:44,970
She has ear muffs.

2793
01:20:45,050 --> 01:20:45,190
Okay.

2794
01:20:45,210 --> 01:20:45,910
So like...

2795
01:20:45,910 --> 01:20:47,990
That connects to the hat.

2796
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:48,970
Which connects to the hat?

2797
01:20:48,970 --> 01:20:50,210
That goes in the middle of her ears.

2798
01:20:50,210 --> 01:20:50,890
Yeah.

2799
01:20:51,030 --> 01:20:53,570
And her ears just come out of her hair, kinda, you know?

2800
01:20:53,850 --> 01:20:56,510
And her hat is like a box or something.

2801
01:20:56,710 --> 01:20:57,230
I don't know.

2802
01:20:57,470 --> 01:20:57,970
I don't remember.

2803
01:20:57,970 --> 01:20:59,210
And then, like, what's the hair?

2804
01:20:59,450 --> 01:21:01,670
Like, if she doesn't have a ponytail, then what does she have?

2805
01:21:01,850 --> 01:21:03,250
I think it's just long hair.

2806
01:21:03,430 --> 01:21:04,410
Like, really long hair.

2807
01:21:04,550 --> 01:21:10,310
And it's, like, silvery, like, very pale pale silver lavender sort of thing.

2808
01:21:10,490 --> 01:21:10,730
Yeah, okay.

2809
01:21:10,810 --> 01:21:11,990
And what about, like, the body?

2810
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:16,960
Well...

2811
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:21,230
Yeah?

2812
01:21:21,230 --> 01:21:21,330
Yeah?

2813
01:21:23,650 --> 01:21:25,910
What does the body look like?

2814
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:26,470
I don't remember.

2815
01:21:26,470 --> 01:21:27,370
What does the body look like?

2816
01:21:27,390 --> 01:21:28,210
I don't remember.

2817
01:21:28,810 --> 01:21:30,210
Oh, she's building muscular?

2818
01:21:30,370 --> 01:21:31,130
So does she show her?

2819
01:21:31,250 --> 01:21:32,210
She is muscular, yeah.

2820
01:21:32,330 --> 01:21:33,950
So does she show her belly?

2821
01:21:35,450 --> 01:21:37,150
Um, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2822
01:21:37,290 --> 01:21:38,130
You know, give her a hat.

2823
01:21:38,630 --> 01:21:38,770
Okay.

2824
01:21:38,830 --> 01:21:43,390
Okay, what about the... Does she wear pants or... But she has huge assets?

2825
01:21:44,050 --> 01:21:46,190
Or does she... Um... Does she?

2826
01:21:46,470 --> 01:21:47,550
No, I would say it's pretty normal.

2827
01:21:47,550 --> 01:21:49,630
Is it flat or medium or huge?

2828
01:21:49,950 --> 01:21:50,610
I think it's medium.

2829
01:21:50,810 --> 01:21:51,430
It's pretty medium.

2830
01:21:51,790 --> 01:21:52,710
Okay, it's too late.

2831
01:21:55,190 --> 01:21:56,690
I think she has a red dress.

2832
01:21:56,930 --> 01:21:57,610
She's very fit.

2833
01:21:57,770 --> 01:21:59,070
Like, muscular and fit, though, right?

2834
01:21:59,270 --> 01:21:59,430
Yeah.

2835
01:21:59,630 --> 01:21:59,690
Okay.

2836
01:21:59,810 --> 01:21:59,830
Yeah.

2837
01:22:00,550 --> 01:22:02,210
It's a long dress or short dress?

2838
01:22:03,470 --> 01:22:04,870
Short, I think.

2839
01:22:05,050 --> 01:22:05,610
Oh, God.

2840
01:22:06,510 --> 01:22:08,190
It's crazy how little I remember.

2841
01:22:08,570 --> 01:22:10,590
Yeah, it's how you play the horse game all the time.

2842
01:22:10,890 --> 01:22:12,710
I never use gold ship, though, you know?

2843
01:22:12,710 --> 01:22:13,390
Wait, what do you use?

2844
01:22:14,490 --> 01:22:15,390
Um... Does she have a tail?

2845
01:22:15,630 --> 01:22:17,910
She does have a tail, yeah.

2846
01:22:17,970 --> 01:22:18,990
All the horse girls have tails.

2847
01:22:19,090 --> 01:22:19,290
Okay.

2848
01:22:21,090 --> 01:22:21,450
Okay.

2849
01:22:21,550 --> 01:22:30,350
Okay, and then... Alright, I think... She's a little hard to use in the game because she does random shit and then it fucks your entire run.

2850
01:22:30,450 --> 01:22:32,530
Oh, yeah, because it's like... It's like based off of the real horse.

2851
01:22:32,930 --> 01:22:33,970
Yes, she's a troll.

2852
01:22:34,230 --> 01:22:34,510
Yeah, yeah.

2853
01:22:34,510 --> 01:22:37,330
So I don't really use her that much because it's so hard to use her.

2854
01:22:37,910 --> 01:22:39,950
Yeah, because... Don't worry, I got her silver hair, guys.

2855
01:22:40,070 --> 01:22:40,410
Don't worry.

2856
01:22:42,890 --> 01:22:44,350
I think I got her correctly.

2857
01:22:45,270 --> 01:22:46,350
I think this is accurate.

2858
01:22:47,930 --> 01:22:49,270
Make sure you got her tail.

2859
01:22:49,270 --> 01:22:50,990
She has... Wait, she has buff legs, right?

2860
01:22:52,250 --> 01:22:53,990
She's pretty fit, I would say, yeah.

2861
01:22:54,130 --> 01:22:55,350
Yeah, because she does a lot of kicking.

2862
01:22:56,090 --> 01:22:56,290
Okay.

2863
01:22:56,470 --> 01:22:56,670
She does.

2864
01:22:56,850 --> 01:22:57,450
She kicks a lot.

2865
01:22:57,550 --> 01:22:58,110
She dropkicks.

2866
01:22:58,110 --> 01:22:59,450
Okay, so I knew I fucked up somewhere.

2867
01:22:59,890 --> 01:23:01,250
I gave her sick legs.

2868
01:23:01,490 --> 01:23:02,190
Don't worry, guys.

2869
01:23:02,610 --> 01:23:03,810
I'm redeeming myself.

2870
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:09,720
Okay.

2871
01:23:10,940 --> 01:23:11,640
There we go.

2872
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:13,720
Actually, no.

2873
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:15,200
I can redeem myself even more.

2874
01:23:22,620 --> 01:23:25,320
Okay, I think I'm pretty... That's pretty good.

2875
01:23:25,780 --> 01:23:26,040
Alright.

2876
01:23:27,180 --> 01:23:28,260
I did it.

2877
01:23:28,940 --> 01:23:29,520
I did it.

2878
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:30,040
Oh, I didn't even color.

2879
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:33,060
I have not been coloring.

2880
01:23:33,620 --> 01:23:35,080
I did not color this.

2881
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:37,960
Okay.

2882
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:40,480
I'm ready whenever.

2883
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:43,760
Uh, yeah.

2884
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:44,680
You know what?

2885
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:45,720
Let's just go for it.

2886
01:23:45,780 --> 01:23:46,680
Let's go for it.

2887
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:48,000
Here, you're not gonna...

2888
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,560
Yeah, mine is not that great.

2889
01:23:50,780 --> 01:23:51,260
Alright.

2890
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:52,580
Alright.

2891
01:23:53,580 --> 01:23:54,000
Ready?

2892
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:54,580
Yeah.

2893
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:01,200
Honestly...

2894
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:03,740
Honestly...

2895
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:04,360
Um...

2896
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:05,460
Am I close?

2897
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:06,860
Am I close?

2898
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:08,120
Honestly?

2899
01:24:09,980 --> 01:24:11,260
Honestly, Koki?

2900
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:12,360
Honestly?

2901
01:24:13,180 --> 01:24:13,500
Yeah?

2902
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:14,600
Did I...

2903
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:15,120
No, no.

2904
01:24:15,460 --> 01:24:16,520
No, I...

2905
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:17,680
You see the vision?

2906
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:18,380
It's a cool image.

2907
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:19,940
Where are we?

2908
01:24:20,660 --> 01:24:21,920
I see the vision.

2909
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:22,820
You see the vision?

2910
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:23,700
Okay, let me...

2911
01:24:23,700 --> 01:24:25,000
Yeah, the neck is really long.

2912
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:28,420
Why is it... I see it, guys.

2913
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:31,740
I look at Google Goldship and I actually get the real horse.

2914
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:34,160
I get the... Yeah, he's still doing it today.

2915
01:24:34,380 --> 01:24:35,760
He's still doing great.

2916
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:37,400
Yeah, he's still alive, guys.

2917
01:24:37,700 --> 01:24:38,120
He is.

2918
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:38,840
Thank God.

2919
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:40,140
He's like... So many horse stories.

2920
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:43,180
Yeah, he gets like $2,000 to like...

2921
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:44,000
Have that horse.

2922
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:44,300
Breed?

2923
01:24:44,460 --> 01:24:44,680
Yeah.

2924
01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:45,060
Oh.

2925
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:45,540
Yeah.

2926
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:47,720
Like, have that horse fuck your horse.

2927
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:48,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2928
01:24:48,860 --> 01:24:52,000
Is it $2,000 or two... Is it $2,000 per...

2929
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:57,260
Per... Per... But like, the thing is... Is it per session or like...

2930
01:24:57,260 --> 01:24:58,120
Just for the day?

2931
01:24:59,000 --> 01:24:59,960
Yeah, how does it work?

2932
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:00,800
Yeah, how does it work?

2933
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:01,640
Is it like...

2934
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:02,280
Per session?

2935
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:05,120
I'm gonna ask... At Drock.

2936
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:10,880
How does... 2 million yen.

2937
01:25:11,020 --> 01:25:12,220
Wait, how much is that in USD?

2938
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:15,780
It's... Wait, that's more than $2,000?

2939
01:25:16,660 --> 01:25:18,720
Is it for a session?

2940
01:25:19,020 --> 01:25:19,600
A day?

2941
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:21,300
Like, what's the...

2942
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:22,100
The process?

2943
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:24,160
What's the whole process?

2944
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:28,380
How... How the horses... How the horses do it?

2945
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:31,300
20K?

2946
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:32,340
Oh, 180 session.

2947
01:25:32,740 --> 01:25:33,820
That's insane.

2948
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:34,640
That's like...

2949
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:35,660
That's like... That's like...

2950
01:25:35,660 --> 01:25:36,100
One and done?

2951
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:36,720
Let's see.

2952
01:25:40,540 --> 01:25:41,680
Per session.

2953
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:44,240
Oh my God.

2954
01:25:44,620 --> 01:25:45,260
Wait, Stucky.

2955
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:46,660
20K?

2956
01:25:46,660 --> 01:25:46,720
20K?

2957
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:48,980
30 to 35K?

2958
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:51,500
30... Wait, he got a raise?

2959
01:25:52,020 --> 01:25:52,600
Like...

2960
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:55,240
It's gotten a more expensive?

2961
01:25:56,020 --> 01:25:56,460
Oh!

2962
01:25:56,840 --> 01:25:58,600
I... I... It's cause like, he's getting older.

2963
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:00,700
So it's like, tick tock.

2964
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:01,080
You know?

2965
01:26:01,420 --> 01:26:02,680
They're like, get your...

2966
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:05,560
Your mini... Mini ships before it's gone.

2967
01:26:06,660 --> 01:26:08,540
Pit, you're paying per breeding session.

2968
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:10,780
The fee covers one mating attempt.

2969
01:26:11,180 --> 01:26:12,360
So what if you're like...

2970
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:14,100
So what if he, like, misses?

2971
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:14,920
What if he misses?

2972
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:15,580
Yeah, what if he...

2973
01:26:15,580 --> 01:26:16,520
Yeah, what if...

2974
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:17,040
Or something.

2975
01:26:17,220 --> 01:26:17,540
I don't know.

2976
01:26:17,660 --> 01:26:19,420
Like, what if he falls out?

2977
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:25,640
How do you mean misses?

2978
01:26:25,980 --> 01:26:26,720
Like, does he...

2979
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:27,240
Oh, I don't know.

2980
01:26:27,340 --> 01:26:28,260
Like, um...

2981
01:26:28,260 --> 01:26:29,780
He doesn't miss.

2982
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:32,420
Oh, Bailey doesn't miss!

2983
01:26:32,420 --> 01:26:32,860
He...

2984
01:26:33,420 --> 01:26:34,720
He stays in!

2985
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:39,620
He doesn't...

2986
01:26:39,620 --> 01:26:40,420
He has a...

2987
01:26:40,420 --> 01:26:42,320
He has a 95% accuracy!

2988
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:43,320
Oh!

2989
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:44,900
Okay, so...

2990
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:49,740
You don't pay for another stat fee if the contract includes a live fold guarantee.

2991
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:50,200
Oh!

2992
01:26:51,740 --> 01:26:52,160
Damn!

2993
01:26:52,860 --> 01:26:53,600
So like, if it...

2994
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:53,940
Okay, but...

2995
01:26:53,940 --> 01:26:54,360
Yeah.

2996
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:56,300
So like, if it didn't work...

2997
01:26:56,300 --> 01:26:57,700
Like, if it doesn't work...

2998
01:26:57,700 --> 01:26:59,340
They're like, the next one's free.

2999
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:00,880
What?

3000
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:01,560
But...

3001
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:02,640
Goldchip is apparently...

3002
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:04,820
Like, his breeding rate is super freaking high.

3003
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:05,200
Yeah.

3004
01:27:05,740 --> 01:27:06,080
Yeah, yeah.

3005
01:27:06,140 --> 01:27:07,160
Everyone just gets pregnant.

3006
01:27:07,780 --> 01:27:08,200
Pregnant.

3007
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:09,440
Pregnant.

3008
01:27:09,940 --> 01:27:10,460
Pregnant?

3009
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:11,420
Pregnant.

3010
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:13,480
Oh, wow!

3011
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:15,400
What a fertile horse!

3012
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:17,700
Yeah, it's 99% rate.

3013
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:18,640
Oh, my God!

3014
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:19,280
That's crazy!

3015
01:27:19,620 --> 01:27:20,120
That's crazy!

3016
01:27:20,380 --> 01:27:21,620
Do I feel like...

3017
01:27:21,620 --> 01:27:21,860
Do they...

3018
01:27:21,860 --> 01:27:22,940
Okay, do they do like...

3019
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:23,620
What is it called?

3020
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:25,460
You know, like when people can't have kids?

3021
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:26,620
They do like the...

3022
01:27:26,620 --> 01:27:27,340
Like the...

3023
01:27:27,340 --> 01:27:32,200
The outside thing, and then they implant the person with the egg.

3024
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:33,920
What is that called?

3025
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:37,360
The IVF thing?

3026
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:39,360
Is that IVF?

3027
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:43,660
Oh, you think when he gets older, they're just gonna store like...

3028
01:27:44,220 --> 01:27:45,720
His horse sperm?

3029
01:27:50,540 --> 01:27:52,260
They're gonna store...

3030
01:27:52,260 --> 01:27:52,760
Can they?

3031
01:27:52,980 --> 01:27:55,140
Because if they really like gold chip, right?

3032
01:27:55,140 --> 01:27:57,080
Can you just store horse sperm?

3033
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:57,720
Yeah!

3034
01:27:58,120 --> 01:27:59,100
Can you store it at...

3035
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:02,580
I mean, you can do it for humans, you should be able to do it for like horses, right?

3036
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:04,100
Yeah, that's so true.

3037
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:07,600
You gotta clean your Google history after this.

3038
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:08,820
Yeah, it can be stored, yeah.

3039
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:12,360
Involves freezing it in liquid nitrogen.

3040
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:13,900
Bro, they're gonna milk him!

3041
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:16,800
No, they're literally gonna milk him!

3042
01:28:19,860 --> 01:28:21,500
My search history spot.

3043
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:24,720
Bro, they're gonna...

3044
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:26,180
They have to keep him alive!

3045
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:27,120
Gold ship alive!

3046
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:28,580
Yeah!

3047
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:29,300
Yeah!

3048
01:28:29,660 --> 01:28:31,620
This has gone too far!

3049
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:33,820
We're just thinking, cause like...

3050
01:28:33,820 --> 01:28:35,960
We gotta keep his bloodline secure!

3051
01:28:37,140 --> 01:28:38,380
You want more gold...

3052
01:28:38,380 --> 01:28:38,620
Oh, yeah!

3053
01:28:38,820 --> 01:28:40,140
Yeah, do not want his...

3054
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:40,360
Yeah, do not want his...

3055
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:40,800
Do...

3056
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:43,580
Do you not want his bloodline insecure?

3057
01:28:44,020 --> 01:28:46,540
Procedures for handling fresh stallions!

3058
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:50,340
That's great.

3059
01:28:50,620 --> 01:28:51,420
That's good.

3060
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:52,420
I like that.

3061
01:28:53,180 --> 01:28:55,820
This bit has gone too far!

3062
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:56,980
We need to move on.

3063
01:28:57,180 --> 01:28:58,260
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

3064
01:28:58,480 --> 01:28:59,240
Your chat...

3065
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:00,280
It's your chat's turn.

3066
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:01,640
Okay, okay, okay.

3067
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:02,020
Next one.

3068
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:02,940
Oh, God.

3069
01:29:02,940 --> 01:29:05,040
Stop saying we...

3070
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:09,280
You're the people that want me to play horse game!

3071
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:11,860
I'm just trying to understand the horse lore!

3072
01:29:11,860 --> 01:29:13,760
I'm in my...

3073
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:15,740
Of course!

3074
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:17,860
Okay, chat...

3075
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:20,860
Okay, chat...

3076
01:29:20,860 --> 01:29:22,860
Alright, chat, give us...

3077
01:29:23,380 --> 01:29:24,880
Give us a suggestion.

3078
01:29:25,620 --> 01:29:27,380
You know what labooboos are?

3079
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:28,440
Yes!

3080
01:29:29,140 --> 01:29:31,100
My 24-carat girls labooboo!

3081
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:32,940
Let's do a labooboo.

3082
01:29:33,100 --> 01:29:33,800
Let's do a labooboo!

3083
01:29:34,060 --> 01:29:34,460
Labooboo!

3084
01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:34,940
Okay, I'll...

3085
01:29:34,940 --> 01:29:35,380
Labooboo!

3086
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:37,160
Labooboo, do you have a labooboo?

3087
01:29:37,860 --> 01:29:38,460
No!

3088
01:29:39,080 --> 01:29:39,480
I...

3089
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:40,080
I used to!

3090
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:41,820
Wait, what happened?

3091
01:29:42,020 --> 01:29:42,820
What did you do to it?

3092
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:50,280
Okay, one story short, I was in an aquarium and a little girl saw my LeBooBoo and she said, Oh my God, I like your LeBooBoo.

3093
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:54,420
And then my friend turned on her camera and said, Oh my God, Lily, you should give her your LeBooBoo.

3094
01:29:54,420 --> 01:29:56,000
She turned on your camera?

3095
01:29:56,620 --> 01:29:57,840
I'm just gonna vlog it.

3096
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:02,760
I'm like, oh, and I'm like, okay, I guess I'll just give her my LeBooBoo.

3097
01:30:02,900 --> 01:30:06,520
Because she made it sound like, Lily, this is probably like her first LeBooBoo and she really wants it.

3098
01:30:06,700 --> 01:30:07,720
And I gave her my LeBooBoo.

3099
01:30:07,940 --> 01:30:09,440
And the girl was like, thanks.

3100
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:10,580
And she looks at it.

3101
01:30:10,700 --> 01:30:13,120
And then she looks at me and she goes, this is my second one.

3102
01:30:13,940 --> 01:30:17,480
And then she fucking picks it and leaves.

3103
01:30:18,180 --> 01:30:20,540
She's like, I don't have one anymore.

3104
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:22,880
Fucking cutie.

3105
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:25,600
You got fleece.

3106
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:26,840
She owes me a new one.

3107
01:30:26,980 --> 01:30:28,420
You got fucking fleece.

3108
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:30,300
I bet you you're not even the first one.

3109
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:39,840
I bet you it was some fucking LeBooBoo scam where like they recruit little girls to go up to random strangers, get their LeBooBoo's, and then like, and then scalp it.

3110
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:42,120
Scalp it on the internet.

3111
01:30:42,580 --> 01:30:43,960
On the TikTok marketplace.

3112
01:30:46,580 --> 01:30:49,120
She didn't even look that like excited.

3113
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:50,660
Oh, thanks.

3114
01:30:50,900 --> 01:30:52,300
It's like my second one or something.

3115
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:53,060
I'm like, oh.

3116
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:57,120
I can't say like, I can't say like, can I have it back?

3117
01:30:57,280 --> 01:30:58,220
You know, it's like rude, you know?

3118
01:30:58,480 --> 01:30:59,180
I'm not gonna do that.

3119
01:30:59,180 --> 01:31:03,780
I can't believe it.

3120
01:31:03,980 --> 01:31:05,360
Well, you got scammed.

3121
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:06,320
Like, I...

3122
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:07,240
You got scammed.

3123
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:08,080
It was a pink one.

3124
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:09,200
You know, like this.

3125
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:10,460
Wait, was it the...

3126
01:31:10,460 --> 01:31:12,020
Okay, wait, do you remember which version?

3127
01:31:12,120 --> 01:31:13,760
Was it the sitting with you and the LeBooBoo?

3128
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:15,100
Or is it...

3129
01:31:16,140 --> 01:31:16,560
It's the...

3130
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:16,960
It's the...

3131
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:17,280
What was it?

3132
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:18,260
Energy LeBooBooBoo?

3133
01:31:18,280 --> 01:31:19,160
Oh, it's the...

3134
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:20,400
I don't know that one.

3135
01:31:20,540 --> 01:31:21,520
I just know that...

3136
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:22,020
Mood?

3137
01:31:22,160 --> 01:31:22,640
I don't remember.

3138
01:31:22,940 --> 01:31:24,340
Oh, it's the newest one.

3139
01:31:24,660 --> 01:31:25,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3140
01:31:25,700 --> 01:31:26,540
They're all past...

3141
01:31:26,540 --> 01:31:27,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3142
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:28,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3143
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:29,100
I heard about it.

3144
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:34,420
I've been having, like, so many, like, LeBooBoo-related videos on my YouTube.

3145
01:31:34,620 --> 01:31:41,140
And I was watching this video from this YouTuber that was, like, opening every mystery box from Popmart.

3146
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:45,760
And I got so invested in, like, LeBooBoo, like, history.

3147
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:50,720
Because they're like, it was so hard to grab this box of LeBooBoo's.

3148
01:31:50,900 --> 01:31:51,940
Like, I had to...

3149
01:31:51,940 --> 01:31:56,580
I had to refresh the marketplace, like, for three days straight to buy it.

3150
01:31:56,580 --> 01:31:57,900
I was like, holy fuck.

3151
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:00,360
There's so many, like, TikTok lives.

3152
01:32:00,680 --> 01:32:02,940
Or they're just, like, unboxing, like, Popmart stuff.

3153
01:32:03,180 --> 01:32:03,820
Yeah, yeah.

3154
01:32:04,300 --> 01:32:05,160
I remember part...

3155
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:05,600
I'm drawing a...

3156
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:05,880
Yeah?

3157
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:06,280
Oh, sorry.

3158
01:32:06,660 --> 01:32:07,040
No, no, no.

3159
01:32:07,160 --> 01:32:08,020
I'm drawing a...

3160
01:32:08,020 --> 01:32:09,060
Doki LeBooBoo.

3161
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:09,840
Draw...

3162
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:10,960
Oh, you know, I'll draw a...

3163
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:12,100
Lily LeBooBoo.

3164
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:12,920
LeBooBoo.

3165
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:13,240
LeBooBoo.

3166
01:32:13,300 --> 01:32:14,660
I love doing words.

3167
01:32:17,340 --> 01:32:19,480
I'll draw a Lily LeBooBoo then.

3168
01:32:22,140 --> 01:32:22,840
And then...

3169
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:24,320
And then...

3170
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:28,920
Dude, did you see that people give their LeBooBoo's, like, outfits and, like, hats and stuff?

3171
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:30,260
Oh, my God, yes!

3172
01:32:30,580 --> 01:32:33,420
They, like, can buy, like, clothes for them and everything.

3173
01:32:33,660 --> 01:32:35,880
Yeah, and, like, glasses, accessories, and everything.

3174
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:39,560
Okay, did you see the one where, like, you can buy, like, a LeBooBoo case?

3175
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:41,040
What?

3176
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:44,520
Where you can, like, imprison them in a little acrylic, like, jar?

3177
01:32:45,820 --> 01:32:47,300
Wait, wait, LeBooBoo case.

3178
01:32:47,640 --> 01:32:49,320
It's, like, okay, it's, like, crazy.

3179
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:50,080
I saw...

3180
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:51,180
Oh, my God, it looks like this.

3181
01:32:51,300 --> 01:32:53,860
It looks like they're, like, they, like, trapped it in a fucking prison.

3182
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:56,420
That's shaped, like, LeBooBoo's.

3183
01:32:57,820 --> 01:32:59,500
Oh, no, I've seen that, I've seen that.

3184
01:33:00,100 --> 01:33:01,120
That's so sad.

3185
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:04,540
I know, I was, like, that's so fucking sad.

3186
01:33:04,820 --> 01:33:05,380
Look at him.

3187
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:06,660
Look at this chat.

3188
01:33:07,740 --> 01:33:09,300
Wait, this is what it looks like.

3189
01:33:10,740 --> 01:33:12,140
Like, he's got...

3190
01:33:12,140 --> 01:33:14,220
It's, like, that Star Wars thing with Han Solo.

3191
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:18,760
It's just encased there forever.

3192
01:33:21,320 --> 01:33:22,040
Permanently.

3193
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:22,980
Okay.

3194
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:24,200
I miss my little boo-boo.

3195
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:27,040
You never trust children.

3196
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:28,320
No.

3197
01:33:28,540 --> 01:33:30,280
Never trust children.

3198
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:35,560
Okay.

3199
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:37,160
I need to color it.

3200
01:33:37,160 --> 01:33:38,300
I need to color it pink.

3201
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:40,440
I'm gonna color it.

3202
01:33:41,100 --> 01:33:41,820
What?

3203
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:46,320
Oh, you're, like, what color is she?

3204
01:33:46,460 --> 01:33:46,940
Or...

3205
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:49,440
Yellow, orange.

3206
01:33:50,380 --> 01:33:52,600
You can literally look at the screen.

3207
01:33:55,160 --> 01:33:56,320
What do you mean?

3208
01:33:57,080 --> 01:33:58,080
What were you saying?

3209
01:33:58,080 --> 01:33:59,680
Maybe, maybe, I don't want to...

3210
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:00,020
You know what?

3211
01:34:00,100 --> 01:34:01,400
I'm not calling you that anymore.

3212
01:34:01,640 --> 01:34:02,360
I'm taking the color.

3213
01:34:02,360 --> 01:34:02,680
What?

3214
01:34:04,020 --> 01:34:06,460
You're, like, you don't deserve it anymore.

3215
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:07,420
You don't...

3216
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:09,640
Oh, my God.

3217
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:11,640
I'm gonna shade you, too.

3218
01:34:11,900 --> 01:34:12,940
Because I'm a good person.

3219
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:13,880
Give me a little color.

3220
01:34:14,260 --> 01:34:17,160
Yeah, I'm gonna give you the clothes you're wearing right now.

3221
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:17,860
All right.

3222
01:34:18,060 --> 01:34:19,300
I'm just making you pink.

3223
01:34:20,300 --> 01:34:20,840
Oh, wait.

3224
01:34:20,860 --> 01:34:21,460
I should give you...

3225
01:34:21,460 --> 01:34:21,960
Yeah, you know what?

3226
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:23,460
I'll give you the clothes that you're wearing.

3227
01:34:26,890 --> 01:34:27,330
You know what?

3228
01:34:27,330 --> 01:34:28,330
I'll even shade...

3229
01:34:28,330 --> 01:34:28,930
I'm so nice.

3230
01:34:28,930 --> 01:34:29,950
I'll even shade you.

3231
01:34:30,250 --> 01:34:31,770
Wow, thank you so much.

3232
01:34:32,830 --> 01:34:33,410
Thank you.

3233
01:34:33,730 --> 01:34:34,130
All right.

3234
01:34:34,910 --> 01:34:36,630
You get to be shaded.

3235
01:34:36,910 --> 01:34:38,350
Wow, look at the opportunity.

3236
01:34:40,110 --> 01:34:41,930
What an honor, you know?

3237
01:34:48,030 --> 01:34:51,130
Okay, now I'll give you your ribbon.

3238
01:34:52,250 --> 01:34:52,710
Ah, ah.

3239
01:34:52,750 --> 01:34:53,230
Oops, sorry.

3240
01:34:53,390 --> 01:34:54,710
I hit my...

3241
01:34:54,710 --> 01:34:55,490
You okay?

3242
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:55,830
Oops.

3243
01:34:56,130 --> 01:34:56,990
Okay, I'm good.

3244
01:34:57,270 --> 01:34:58,250
Okay, there you go.

3245
01:34:58,930 --> 01:34:59,570
I got...

3246
01:34:59,570 --> 01:35:01,370
The boo-boo is done.

3247
01:35:04,410 --> 01:35:05,770
What's your favorite number?

3248
01:35:07,870 --> 01:35:09,810
Why are you laughing?

3249
01:35:10,010 --> 01:35:11,350
That's so out of nowhere.

3250
01:35:14,470 --> 01:35:15,190
Um...

3251
01:35:15,190 --> 01:35:15,810
Um...

3252
01:35:15,810 --> 01:35:16,850
What is my favorite number?

3253
01:35:16,950 --> 01:35:17,510
69.

3254
01:35:19,190 --> 01:35:19,670
Okay.

3255
01:35:22,530 --> 01:35:24,210
That's my favorite number.

3256
01:35:26,430 --> 01:35:28,150
Why would there be numbers?

3257
01:35:30,190 --> 01:35:31,190
All right, I'm ready.

3258
01:35:31,730 --> 01:35:32,370
I'm ready.

3259
01:35:32,670 --> 01:35:33,070
All right.

3260
01:35:33,430 --> 01:35:35,190
Oh, you didn't link the loboop.

3261
01:35:35,290 --> 01:35:36,230
I could've just looked that way.

3262
01:35:36,410 --> 01:35:36,690
Whoop.

3263
01:35:37,970 --> 01:35:38,290
All right.

3264
01:35:47,020 --> 01:35:51,920
Double channeled over here.

3265
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:52,020
Double channeled over here.

3266
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:55,960
A little gremlin letting me there.

3267
01:35:59,820 --> 01:36:01,860
I was like, I'm gonna kill you.

3268
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:07,000
Don't give her too much alcohol, guys.

3269
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:11,800
Do you have a loboopoo?

3270
01:36:11,980 --> 01:36:13,320
I actually don't have a loboopoo.

3271
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:14,740
I never bought a loboopoo.

3272
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:16,440
They're so cute, though.

3273
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:18,800
I know they're just a trend thingy, but I like them.

3274
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:20,300
They've been around for so long.

3275
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:22,300
It's crazy that they just blew up this year.

3276
01:36:22,440 --> 01:36:24,740
I've seen them around for the longest time.

3277
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:25,840
Wow.

3278
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:29,280
Whoever made it is pretty happy right now, I bet.

3279
01:36:29,420 --> 01:36:29,640
Yeah.

3280
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:40,100
I heard that the reason why it blew up was because it started in K-pop, actually.

3281
01:36:40,660 --> 01:36:43,140
Because a K-pop star held a loboopoo on her...

3282
01:36:43,140 --> 01:36:45,780
She had a loboopoo on her bag, and she was talking about it.

3283
01:36:45,940 --> 01:36:49,680
And then the K-pop fandom was like, I want to be just like her.

3284
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:51,060
And then it spread.

3285
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:51,820
Wait, that's why?

3286
01:36:51,900 --> 01:36:52,120
Yeah.

3287
01:36:52,360 --> 01:36:55,780
Yeah, that's how it spread into the Western audience.

3288
01:36:55,780 --> 01:37:00,240
Yeah, someone said it was Lisa from Blackpink had a loboopoo.

3289
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:01,560
That makes sense.

3290
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:01,800
That makes sense.

3291
01:37:01,940 --> 01:37:02,400
That makes sense.

3292
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:02,880
And then...

3293
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:03,240
And then...

3294
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:05,240
That's why now we have loboopoos everywhere.

3295
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:06,400
Oh my god.

3296
01:37:06,780 --> 01:37:07,060
Loboopoos are everywhere.

3297
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:09,520
I'm the $69 loboopoo.

3298
01:37:10,460 --> 01:37:11,360
You cost $69.

3299
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:12,340
Yeah, I cost $69.

3300
01:37:16,140 --> 01:37:19,260
Oh man, you heard like the counterfeit version of loboopoo?

3301
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:21,540
Oh my god, I love loboopoos.

3302
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:23,900
Wait, why do you love loboopoos?

3303
01:37:23,980 --> 01:37:25,440
They're so janky, man.

3304
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:26,520
I want to get one for Michael.

3305
01:37:26,700 --> 01:37:27,860
I just think he would love...

3306
01:37:27,860 --> 01:37:28,800
You should...

3307
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:32,620
You should get a customized loboopoo that looks like him.

3308
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:33,480
Loboopoo.

3309
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:35,500
You should get one that looks like him.

3310
01:37:37,120 --> 01:37:38,740
You can commission that.

3311
01:37:38,740 --> 01:37:40,460
I'm pretty sure you can commission it.

3312
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:42,220
Why do you custom loboopoo?

3313
01:37:42,220 --> 01:37:42,660
Custom.

3314
01:37:42,660 --> 01:37:43,500
Or loboopoo for loboopoo.

3315
01:37:43,620 --> 01:37:44,060
Custom.

3316
01:37:44,740 --> 01:37:45,180
Loboopoo.

3317
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:47,740
That would be so cute.

3318
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:48,900
There is!

3319
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:49,900
There's one on Etsy.

3320
01:37:51,220 --> 01:37:52,840
Wait, that's so cute.

3321
01:37:53,100 --> 01:37:54,120
Wait, look at this.

3322
01:37:54,120 --> 01:37:55,400
Look at this.

3323
01:37:57,200 --> 01:37:58,920
That is actually so cute.

3324
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:00,460
Oh my god.

3325
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:01,260
That is horrible.

3326
01:38:01,580 --> 01:38:01,940
You should...

3327
01:38:01,940 --> 01:38:02,940
You should...

3328
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:06,040
If you use your clout, they'll do it for you.

3329
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:07,560
They'll accept your commission.

3330
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:08,700
No, like...

3331
01:38:08,700 --> 01:38:09,120
No, like...

3332
01:38:10,860 --> 01:38:12,140
No, like...

3333
01:38:12,900 --> 01:38:13,540
No, like...

3334
01:38:13,540 --> 01:38:14,620
He's like...

3335
01:38:14,620 --> 01:38:15,460
Hello, I'm...

3336
01:38:15,460 --> 01:38:16,940
I'm Lily Pichu.

3337
01:38:17,120 --> 01:38:18,340
Can I...

3338
01:38:18,340 --> 01:38:19,080
Can I...

3339
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:19,600
Can I...

3340
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:20,260
Give me a microwave.

3341
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:22,340
Yeah, I need...

3342
01:38:22,340 --> 01:38:23,960
Give me a microwave.

3343
01:38:23,960 --> 01:38:25,120
Please, I need it.

3344
01:38:25,120 --> 01:38:28,140
I need to commission you, please.

3345
01:38:28,380 --> 01:38:28,440
Okay.

3346
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:29,740
She's accepting commissions!

3347
01:38:30,820 --> 01:38:31,500
Wait!

3348
01:38:32,380 --> 01:38:34,760
She's actually accepting commissions.

3349
01:38:35,080 --> 01:38:35,820
She says...

3350
01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:37,820
It's like, DM for inquiries.

3351
01:38:39,320 --> 01:38:40,680
Let's see...

3352
01:38:41,060 --> 01:38:41,720
It's time.

3353
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,520
Oh my god, these are crazy.

3354
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:44,220
Yeah, I know!

3355
01:38:44,540 --> 01:38:45,980
Hers are insane, though.

3356
01:38:46,360 --> 01:38:46,480
Wow.

3357
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:48,760
Oh my god, they're so good.

3358
01:38:49,480 --> 01:38:50,220
They are good, though.

3359
01:38:50,380 --> 01:38:51,340
Yeah, they're all really pretty.

3360
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:53,880
Okay, I'll show you guys which one I linked.

3361
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:54,740
I mean...

3362
01:38:54,740 --> 01:38:57,380
I did give Michael a regular little boo-boo.

3363
01:38:58,020 --> 01:38:59,880
And I watched him as he...

3364
01:38:59,880 --> 01:39:01,740
You know, attached it to his bag.

3365
01:39:01,980 --> 01:39:02,120
Yeah.

3366
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:04,160
And then I watched him again as...

3367
01:39:04,160 --> 01:39:04,740
When we went out.

3368
01:39:04,900 --> 01:39:06,120
I just think he's embarrassed.

3369
01:39:06,260 --> 01:39:07,600
And he put it back in his bag.

3370
01:39:09,020 --> 01:39:10,640
I'm like, you shithead.

3371
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:12,200
You little f- Are you serious?

3372
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:12,860
Wait.

3373
01:39:13,160 --> 01:39:14,240
Are you ashamed?

3374
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:15,140
Are you embarrassed?

3375
01:39:16,060 --> 01:39:18,480
He'll put it on if it's like a custom painted one.

3376
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:19,860
And you tell him how much it costs.

3377
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:21,020
He's embarrassed.

3378
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:24,680
He didn't want to be seen with that around.

3379
01:39:27,080 --> 01:39:27,480
Oh.

3380
01:39:31,820 --> 01:39:32,680
Oh my god.

3381
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:34,200
No, if you make him...

3382
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:36,280
If you get him a custom la-foo-foo.

3383
01:39:36,420 --> 01:39:37,040
Or la-boo-boo.

3384
01:39:37,160 --> 01:39:38,360
He'll have to put it on.

3385
01:39:38,380 --> 01:39:40,000
Yeah, if I customize it.

3386
01:39:40,340 --> 01:39:40,620
Yeah.

3387
01:39:40,940 --> 01:39:43,020
Put my whole heart and soul into it.

3388
01:39:43,140 --> 01:39:43,780
Yeah, and then be...

3389
01:39:43,780 --> 01:39:45,760
And then like, you'd be like, I did this for you.

3390
01:39:46,060 --> 01:39:47,560
But you don't tell him that you mean lies.

3391
01:39:47,680 --> 01:39:49,080
And like, you paid someone else to do it.

3392
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:50,580
He'll assume you did it yourself.

3393
01:39:50,820 --> 01:39:51,560
But then like...

3394
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:53,640
If you omit the information...

3395
01:39:53,640 --> 01:39:55,320
He'll have to put it on his bag.

3396
01:39:55,940 --> 01:39:57,260
I bet I can try to do it.

3397
01:39:57,360 --> 01:39:58,800
Like, I just get like tufts of like...

3398
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:00,000
Fake brown hair.

3399
01:40:00,020 --> 01:40:00,700
Oh, that's true.

3400
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:02,500
His hair?

3401
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:03,420
It looks so bad.

3402
01:40:03,640 --> 01:40:04,560
It's like voodoo dolls.

3403
01:40:04,940 --> 01:40:06,100
You get a voodoo doll.

3404
01:40:06,720 --> 01:40:08,080
That'd be kind of funny though.

3405
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:08,380
A voodoo...

3406
01:40:08,380 --> 01:40:09,920
You should do it on stream.

3407
01:40:10,940 --> 01:40:11,720
Make a Michael...

3408
01:40:11,720 --> 01:40:13,800
Yeah, make a Michael la-boo-boo.

3409
01:40:14,380 --> 01:40:15,500
That's a cute idea.

3410
01:40:15,860 --> 01:40:16,220
That is.

3411
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:16,600
I might do that.

3412
01:40:16,640 --> 01:40:18,160
And then they get like a matching one.

3413
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:19,340
And be like, we can match.

3414
01:40:19,340 --> 01:40:20,520
We can put it on...

3415
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:22,660
So like, I'll put it on my bag.

3416
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:23,000
Oh my god.

3417
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:24,900
And then someone was like, la-boo-doo.

3418
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:26,360
La-boo-doo?

3419
01:40:26,360 --> 01:40:27,780
That's so good.

3420
01:40:28,060 --> 01:40:28,580
That's so good.

3421
01:40:28,580 --> 01:40:29,820
Wait, that's so good.

3422
01:40:30,260 --> 01:40:30,540
Copy.

3423
01:40:30,780 --> 01:40:30,980
Wait.

3424
01:40:31,140 --> 01:40:32,240
Someone padded that.

3425
01:40:32,700 --> 01:40:33,600
I don't padded it.

3426
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:35,940
Someone la-la-la voodoo.

3427
01:40:36,520 --> 01:40:37,040
Let's get out.

3428
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:40,420
You can...

3429
01:40:40,420 --> 01:40:42,340
And you can use his actual hair.

3430
01:40:44,540 --> 01:40:45,460
Oh my god.

3431
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:46,440
Okay.

3432
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:48,480
I should get him when he's sleeping, huh?

3433
01:40:48,580 --> 01:40:50,960
But it needs to be like a place where he won't notice.

3434
01:40:50,960 --> 01:41:02,260
Yeah, you can, like... You can, like, he's sleeping and you cut a bit of his hair, and then, like, you can... It doesn't have to be, like, his entire... It could be, like, um... Like, you glue it.

3435
01:41:02,580 --> 01:41:05,700
Yeah, yeah, time it and glue it onto the... Oh, my God.

3436
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:09,660
It would mean so much more because I'm using his actual hair.

3437
01:41:09,900 --> 01:41:11,020
That's so true.

3438
01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:12,540
Oh, my God.

3439
01:41:12,720 --> 01:41:13,600
That's so smart.

3440
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:14,680
That's so smart.

3441
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:15,640
You should do it on stream.

3442
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:18,240
Not the cutting his hair part, but...

3443
01:41:18,240 --> 01:41:19,260
I'm blaming you.

3444
01:41:21,480 --> 01:41:22,760
Am I the asshole?

3445
01:41:23,220 --> 01:41:24,700
I cut off a bit of my body.

3446
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:26,120
Hair grows back.

3447
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:27,620
It's not... Hair grows back.

3448
01:41:28,860 --> 01:41:29,260
Yeah.

3449
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:30,040
Exactly.

3450
01:41:30,440 --> 01:41:34,580
Maybe, like, the back of his... Yeah, do his back of the head because he won't look... Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3451
01:41:34,580 --> 01:41:35,200
He won't look at it.

3452
01:41:35,240 --> 01:41:36,320
You should do the back of his head.

3453
01:41:37,700 --> 01:41:41,180
That is the best idea you've had all night.

3454
01:41:41,340 --> 01:41:43,040
I had so many ideas.

3455
01:41:43,240 --> 01:41:45,840
So many, but this tops all of them for some reason.

3456
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:50,840
And then... And then... And then we had a voodoo doll.

3457
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:54,940
And so if Michael... And so if Michael pisses you off...

3458
01:41:54,940 --> 01:41:57,520
Should I gather his fingernails, too, while I'm at it?

3459
01:41:58,160 --> 01:41:59,560
Yeah, you should.

3460
01:42:01,240 --> 01:42:03,100
You did not sound convinced.

3461
01:42:03,880 --> 01:42:05,600
You're like, yeah, you should.

3462
01:42:08,460 --> 01:42:09,260
All right.

3463
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:10,180
We'll stop at the hair.

3464
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:10,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3465
01:42:10,640 --> 01:42:11,340
We'll stop at the hair.

3466
01:42:11,560 --> 01:42:11,840
Yeah, it's fine.

3467
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:14,280
But all I'm saying is that if he ever pisses you off...

3468
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:16,020
You know what to do with the la voodoo doll.

3469
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:17,380
I beat the shit.

3470
01:42:18,940 --> 01:42:20,160
I'm joking, I'm joking.

3471
01:42:20,220 --> 01:42:23,400
You dropped the la voodoo doll from like...

3472
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:24,860
From like a building.

3473
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:25,960
And you'd be like...

3474
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:26,180
No!

3475
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:27,640
Don't piss me off.

3476
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:32,680
I would take good care of it.

3477
01:42:33,220 --> 01:42:34,220
Didn't you like...

3478
01:42:34,220 --> 01:42:36,600
I was watching a stream before I started a stream.

3479
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,960
When Michael came into your room, didn't you say you were gonna beat the shit out of him?

3480
01:42:40,980 --> 01:42:41,600
It's a...

3481
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:42,060
It's a...

3482
01:42:42,060 --> 01:42:42,280
It's a...

3483
01:42:42,280 --> 01:42:42,300
It's a...

3484
01:42:42,300 --> 01:42:43,280
It's a...

3485
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:46,840
No, it's because there's a meme that I beat him.

3486
01:42:46,840 --> 01:42:49,340
And like, obviously, don't beat him, right?

3487
01:42:49,740 --> 01:42:50,160
Right?

3488
01:42:50,780 --> 01:42:51,180
Sure.

3489
01:42:51,280 --> 01:42:51,920
Don't fucking wait.

3490
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:56,540
No, I'm actually gonna beat him.

3491
01:42:56,740 --> 01:42:57,560
We don't believe it.

3492
01:42:57,640 --> 01:42:58,120
No, we don't.

3493
01:42:58,240 --> 01:42:58,580
We don't.

3494
01:42:58,660 --> 01:42:59,580
I swear we don't.

3495
01:43:00,580 --> 01:43:03,080
So, you know, sometimes I make you little jokes about it.

3496
01:43:03,360 --> 01:43:05,900
How many times you made this little joke, Lily?

3497
01:43:06,500 --> 01:43:07,600
I just think it a lot.

3498
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:08,700
God damn it.

3499
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:11,240
I don't beat Michael.

3500
01:43:12,420 --> 01:43:13,640
He's a good boy.

3501
01:43:13,880 --> 01:43:15,420
He's just in his garage.

3502
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:17,280
Wait, is Michael here right now?

3503
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:19,540
He's in his garage downstairs.

3504
01:43:20,020 --> 01:43:21,000
Should we ask him?

3505
01:43:22,200 --> 01:43:24,180
No, let me slizz on stream.

3506
01:43:24,640 --> 01:43:25,820
Please stop hitting me.

3507
01:43:25,860 --> 01:43:26,760
And I'm like, can you not?

3508
01:43:27,900 --> 01:43:29,060
It's so hard.

3509
01:43:29,340 --> 01:43:30,760
To go against these allegations.

3510
01:43:31,160 --> 01:43:32,100
I don't see what you think.

3511
01:43:32,980 --> 01:43:34,100
I need a lawyer.

3512
01:43:40,820 --> 01:43:42,140
My chat turned.

3513
01:43:42,360 --> 01:43:43,260
My chat suggests.

3514
01:43:43,960 --> 01:43:44,900
So much.

3515
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,200
I was like, Michael, blink if you are in danger.

3516
01:43:50,180 --> 01:43:50,820
Okay.

3517
01:43:51,620 --> 01:43:52,760
Give us a character.

3518
01:43:53,160 --> 01:43:54,580
Give us a character, guys.

3519
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:56,980
Oh, my God.

3520
01:43:58,220 --> 01:44:00,500
I'm not sober anymore.

3521
01:44:01,080 --> 01:44:01,480
I am.

3522
01:44:05,700 --> 01:44:08,320
So, what's it from Michael?

3523
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:13,020
Because I don't remember what Michael looks like.

3524
01:44:13,180 --> 01:44:15,840
I would love to see a rendition of Michael.

3525
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:18,640
You know how, like, Michael doesn't upload videos a lot?

3526
01:44:18,920 --> 01:44:20,220
Oh, my God.

3527
01:44:21,140 --> 01:44:24,780
I'll have you know, he uploaded a short recently.

3528
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:29,400
I can't believe that.

3529
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:32,960
I

3530
01:44:38,070 --> 01:44:42,290
don't know.

3531
01:44:42,490 --> 01:44:43,850
It's been so long for me.

3532
01:44:44,970 --> 01:44:47,070
Well, video five months, yes.

3533
01:44:47,290 --> 01:44:50,870
But, shorts was like, oh, my God.

3534
01:44:51,090 --> 01:44:51,370
What do you mean?

3535
01:44:51,370 --> 01:44:52,350
He has two shorts.

3536
01:44:52,790 --> 01:44:53,970
He has two shorts.

3537
01:44:53,970 --> 01:44:55,330
He has two shorts.

3538
01:44:55,330 --> 01:44:56,630
So, I don't even...

3539
01:44:56,630 --> 01:44:57,210
Wait.

3540
01:45:02,770 --> 01:45:03,610
Okay, so, Michael?

3541
01:45:03,990 --> 01:45:04,710
Okay, Mike.

3542
01:45:04,870 --> 01:45:05,010
Okay.

3543
01:45:05,690 --> 01:45:06,090
How...

3544
01:45:06,090 --> 01:45:06,890
When was the last time...

3545
01:45:06,890 --> 01:45:07,650
Wait, you never finished...

3546
01:45:07,650 --> 01:45:09,070
When was the last time he uploaded a short?

3547
01:45:10,370 --> 01:45:12,290
I think, like, a month ago, right?

3548
01:45:12,450 --> 01:45:13,190
Is that true?

3549
01:45:13,390 --> 01:45:13,870
At chat.

3550
01:45:14,090 --> 01:45:14,550
Is that true?

3551
01:45:15,170 --> 01:45:16,330
I'm trying to...

3552
01:45:16,330 --> 01:45:17,010
Where does it stay?

3553
01:45:17,110 --> 01:45:17,830
Three weeks ago.

3554
01:45:18,510 --> 01:45:19,010
Three weeks.

3555
01:45:19,110 --> 01:45:20,010
I haven't watched that short.

3556
01:45:20,210 --> 01:45:20,310
Wait.

3557
01:45:20,310 --> 01:45:22,310
I haven't watched that short yet.

3558
01:45:23,070 --> 01:45:23,550
Okay.

3559
01:45:23,930 --> 01:45:24,870
It's so true.

3560
01:45:29,970 --> 01:45:30,450
Okay.

3561
01:45:31,150 --> 01:45:32,290
Oh, thank God.

3562
01:45:32,650 --> 01:45:34,690
When chat was like, draw him with a black...

3563
01:45:34,690 --> 01:45:37,170
I'm not gonna draw him with a black eye, guys.

3564
01:45:38,170 --> 01:45:38,650
No.

3565
01:45:38,990 --> 01:45:39,470
No, no.

3566
01:45:40,170 --> 01:45:41,270
I don't actually beat me.

3567
01:45:41,270 --> 01:45:42,050
I don't beat everything.

3568
01:45:42,350 --> 01:45:43,530
I don't beat Michael.

3569
01:45:43,690 --> 01:45:44,710
I don't beat my dogs.

3570
01:45:46,190 --> 01:45:49,050
She only does it in Minecraft, guys.

3571
01:45:49,330 --> 01:45:50,030
And that...

3572
01:45:50,030 --> 01:45:50,610
Only in Minecraft.

3573
01:45:51,050 --> 01:45:53,450
But that makes it okay, apparently.

3574
01:45:53,810 --> 01:45:55,310
That makes it...

3575
01:45:55,310 --> 01:45:56,730
No, Minecraft is better.

3576
01:45:57,070 --> 01:45:58,130
Because, like...

3577
01:45:58,130 --> 01:45:59,870
You can't leave your dog in Minecraft.

3578
01:46:00,210 --> 01:46:01,590
And, you know, log in again.

3579
01:46:01,770 --> 01:46:03,310
And they're probably still waiting for you.

3580
01:46:03,310 --> 01:46:04,010
That's so true.

3581
01:46:04,190 --> 01:46:04,990
So, Michael...

3582
01:46:04,990 --> 01:46:05,810
Michael...

3583
01:46:05,810 --> 01:46:10,030
You have, like, a Michael doll right there waiting for you every time you're angry.

3584
01:46:11,650 --> 01:46:13,550
I don't think he makes me angry.

3585
01:46:14,130 --> 01:46:16,550
As much as, uh...

3586
01:46:16,550 --> 01:46:19,270
As much as what?

3587
01:46:20,210 --> 01:46:21,710
Wait, what does Michael look like?

3588
01:46:22,650 --> 01:46:24,270
Can you describe him?

3589
01:46:25,430 --> 01:46:26,470
Okay, uh...

3590
01:46:26,470 --> 01:46:26,890
Okay, okay.

3591
01:46:26,990 --> 01:46:28,110
I'm gonna do my best.

3592
01:46:28,410 --> 01:46:28,430
Okay.

3593
01:46:30,430 --> 01:46:30,950
Guy.

3594
01:46:31,650 --> 01:46:31,950
Okay.

3595
01:46:32,790 --> 01:46:33,810
Five three and a half.

3596
01:46:34,890 --> 01:46:35,790
Is that...

3597
01:46:35,790 --> 01:46:36,830
Half Filipino, half white.

3598
01:46:36,830 --> 01:46:38,130
Is that taller or...

3599
01:46:38,890 --> 01:46:39,410
Or...

3600
01:46:39,410 --> 01:46:39,890
Shorter.

3601
01:46:40,030 --> 01:46:40,530
Shorter than you.

3602
01:46:41,170 --> 01:46:42,010
Same height.

3603
01:46:42,310 --> 01:46:42,930
Oh, same height.

3604
01:46:43,330 --> 01:46:44,370
Wait, what's his nose?

3605
01:46:45,330 --> 01:46:45,930
Uh...

3606
01:46:45,930 --> 01:46:46,510
Okay, um...

3607
01:46:46,510 --> 01:46:47,930
Do you know Daniel Radcliffe?

3608
01:46:48,550 --> 01:46:48,910
Yeah.

3609
01:46:49,850 --> 01:46:51,490
In his Harry Potter form?

3610
01:46:52,250 --> 01:46:52,770
Yeah.

3611
01:46:55,610 --> 01:46:57,210
So, just give him brown hair.

3612
01:46:57,310 --> 01:46:57,750
What the heck?

3613
01:46:58,390 --> 01:46:59,590
I said nose!

3614
01:47:00,090 --> 01:47:00,870
Wait, what?

3615
01:47:01,470 --> 01:47:03,710
I said nose!

3616
01:47:04,210 --> 01:47:05,610
Filipino Harry Potter!

3617
01:47:06,090 --> 01:47:06,950
Just go for it.

3618
01:47:07,150 --> 01:47:07,930
Filipino Harry...

3619
01:47:07,930 --> 01:47:09,930
Filipino Harry Potter!

3620
01:47:09,930 --> 01:47:10,850
They probably could have been a bad thing.

3621
01:47:10,990 --> 01:47:12,110
They probably could have been a bad thing.

3622
01:47:12,150 --> 01:47:13,970
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

3623
01:47:14,610 --> 01:47:14,830
Filipino...

3624
01:47:15,610 --> 01:47:16,030
Guys...

3625
01:47:16,030 --> 01:47:18,750
How do I draw Filipino Harry Potter?

3626
01:47:19,270 --> 01:47:19,690
Harry...

3627
01:47:30,330 --> 01:47:33,070
Is that like...

3628
01:47:33,070 --> 01:47:34,090
What makes...

3629
01:47:34,090 --> 01:47:36,270
What makes Harry Potter Filipino?

3630
01:47:37,490 --> 01:47:37,950
You're...

3631
01:47:37,950 --> 01:47:40,090
You're a Filipino Harry.

3632
01:47:40,810 --> 01:47:42,250
I'm a what?

3633
01:47:47,350 --> 01:47:48,510
Wait, what does he wear?

3634
01:47:49,010 --> 01:47:49,670
I don't...

3635
01:47:49,670 --> 01:47:51,370
Okay, so...

3636
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,560
Wait, that makes his forehead...

3637
01:47:55,560 --> 01:47:56,340
He's smart.

3638
01:47:56,520 --> 01:47:57,160
He's like...

3639
01:47:58,680 --> 01:47:59,560
A coder.

3640
01:47:59,780 --> 01:48:01,500
So, like, his forehead is fine.

3641
01:48:06,500 --> 01:48:07,120
There you go.

3642
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:11,200
And then...

3643
01:48:11,200 --> 01:48:12,440
Wait, okay.

3644
01:48:13,880 --> 01:48:15,060
What does his...

3645
01:48:15,060 --> 01:48:16,740
Yeah, I mean, he's a coder, right?

3646
01:48:16,740 --> 01:48:18,920
So he has to be, like, super smart.

3647
01:48:18,920 --> 01:48:22,000
He did that thing with the fish in the stock market.

3648
01:48:22,300 --> 01:48:23,740
And then he lost money.

3649
01:48:23,900 --> 01:48:24,940
But, like, that doesn't...

3650
01:48:24,940 --> 01:48:25,740
That's not the point.

3651
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:27,080
He made that.

3652
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:35,880
What does he wear?

3653
01:48:37,640 --> 01:48:38,760
Guys, what does he wear?

3654
01:48:39,300 --> 01:48:40,320
Does he just wear a t-shirt?

3655
01:48:51,550 --> 01:48:51,870
Okay.

3656
01:48:54,050 --> 01:48:54,870
Okay, what does...

3657
01:48:54,870 --> 01:48:56,030
Oh, does he wear flip-flops?

3658
01:48:56,090 --> 01:48:56,590
Does he get it?

3659
01:48:56,690 --> 01:48:57,130
Does he get it?

3660
01:48:57,210 --> 01:48:58,270
Does he wear flip-flops?

3661
01:48:59,010 --> 01:48:59,330
Oh.

3662
01:48:59,550 --> 01:49:00,130
Oh, my God.

3663
01:49:00,150 --> 01:49:01,030
Yes, he does.

3664
01:49:01,390 --> 01:49:01,650
Okay.

3665
01:49:01,790 --> 01:49:02,030
He does.

3666
01:49:02,230 --> 01:49:02,870
What about long...

3667
01:49:02,870 --> 01:49:03,770
Shorts or pants?

3668
01:49:05,010 --> 01:49:05,330
Shorts.

3669
01:49:05,730 --> 01:49:06,050
Okay.

3670
01:49:06,130 --> 01:49:09,370
A yellow t-shirt and, like, brown shorts.

3671
01:49:09,370 --> 01:49:09,790
Okay.

3672
01:49:10,070 --> 01:49:12,210
Does he have buff legs or skinny legs?

3673
01:49:12,850 --> 01:49:14,950
Um, they're skinnier than his arms.

3674
01:49:14,970 --> 01:49:17,270
His arms are super buff, though.

3675
01:49:17,510 --> 01:49:17,970
Oh, okay.

3676
01:49:18,190 --> 01:49:19,230
I messed that one up.

3677
01:49:19,410 --> 01:49:19,650
Don't worry.

3678
01:49:19,730 --> 01:49:20,270
I'll fix it.

3679
01:49:20,730 --> 01:49:21,330
No problem.

3680
01:49:24,330 --> 01:49:24,770
Okay.

3681
01:49:25,010 --> 01:49:25,310
It's okay.

3682
01:49:25,590 --> 01:49:26,690
He's just like Sans.

3683
01:49:26,830 --> 01:49:27,870
I'm just drawing Sans again.

3684
01:49:28,790 --> 01:49:30,030
And then make sure...

3685
01:49:30,030 --> 01:49:32,130
His eyes are, like, um...

3686
01:49:32,130 --> 01:49:33,810
They're pretty, like, boba balls.

3687
01:49:33,870 --> 01:49:34,810
I call them sometimes.

3688
01:49:35,030 --> 01:49:35,190
Boba balls?

3689
01:49:35,190 --> 01:49:35,930
They're round...

3690
01:49:35,930 --> 01:49:36,370
Okay.

3691
01:49:36,710 --> 01:49:39,030
Like, a bit of a crazed glint to it, almost.

3692
01:49:39,490 --> 01:49:39,870
Okay.

3693
01:49:40,650 --> 01:49:41,630
I got this.

3694
01:49:42,530 --> 01:49:42,690
Mm-hmm.

3695
01:49:43,010 --> 01:49:45,230
Make sure to draw him really buff, though.

3696
01:49:46,010 --> 01:49:47,730
Wait, but you said he has skinny legs.

3697
01:49:48,470 --> 01:49:49,850
Oh, like, his arms, I mean.

3698
01:49:50,070 --> 01:49:50,310
Okay.

3699
01:49:50,510 --> 01:49:55,270
It's, like, buff as in, like, rip the shirt buff type arms that will rip the shirt off?

3700
01:49:55,930 --> 01:49:56,030
Okay.

3701
01:49:56,030 --> 01:49:56,090
Okay.

3702
01:49:56,930 --> 01:49:57,450
Alright.

3703
01:49:57,730 --> 01:49:59,150
That's enough information for me.

3704
01:50:02,070 --> 01:50:02,590
Okay.

3705
01:50:09,740 --> 01:50:10,260
Alright.

3706
01:50:12,120 --> 01:50:13,460
Okay, what color is the shirt?

3707
01:50:14,220 --> 01:50:14,940
Uh, yellow.

3708
01:50:15,160 --> 01:50:15,560
Yellow, yellow.

3709
01:50:15,780 --> 01:50:16,140
Okay.

3710
01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:18,400
Um...

3711
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:20,740
And then he likes to ride motorcycles.

3712
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:21,700
I remember that.

3713
01:50:21,700 --> 01:50:22,080
He does.

3714
01:50:22,260 --> 01:50:23,300
He loves motorcycles.

3715
01:50:24,020 --> 01:50:25,680
And yet, he used to have a goldfish.

3716
01:50:25,860 --> 01:50:26,640
He died already.

3717
01:50:27,240 --> 01:50:30,620
I don't remember what motorcycles look like, so I think this is...

3718
01:50:30,620 --> 01:50:32,880
I think it's almost...

3719
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:34,240
Motorcycles have one wheel.

3720
01:50:34,440 --> 01:50:35,060
Two wheels, right?

3721
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:36,440
Two wheels, yes.

3722
01:50:36,440 --> 01:50:36,700
Okay.

3723
01:50:37,460 --> 01:50:39,280
Like a bicycle, except not really.

3724
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:40,460
Yeah, yeah.

3725
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:45,880
There you go.

3726
01:50:46,920 --> 01:50:48,240
There's his motorcycle.

3727
01:50:50,380 --> 01:50:51,500
And then...

3728
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:53,360
Uh...

3729
01:50:53,360 --> 01:50:55,020
Oh, and his goldfish.

3730
01:50:55,140 --> 01:50:56,080
His dead goldfish.

3731
01:50:56,780 --> 01:50:57,840
Yeah, then...

3732
01:50:57,840 --> 01:50:58,980
Rest in peace, Frederick.

3733
01:51:01,280 --> 01:51:02,160
Here we go.

3734
01:51:02,720 --> 01:51:03,720
I think...

3735
01:51:03,720 --> 01:51:05,360
I think I got it, right?

3736
01:51:06,660 --> 01:51:07,220
Yeah?

3737
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:07,960
Wait.

3738
01:51:15,460 --> 01:51:17,440
Wait, did I spell Filipino right?

3739
01:51:17,700 --> 01:51:18,680
I hope I'm...

3740
01:51:20,200 --> 01:51:21,300
I'm really bad.

3741
01:51:22,280 --> 01:51:24,100
I'm really bad at spelling.

3742
01:51:31,890 --> 01:51:33,430
Wait, I forgot another L.

3743
01:51:33,850 --> 01:51:34,310
There you go.

3744
01:51:35,710 --> 01:51:36,050
Wait.

3745
01:51:36,290 --> 01:51:37,310
No, it's P. Two Ps.

3746
01:51:37,570 --> 01:51:37,750
Whoops.

3747
01:51:38,070 --> 01:51:38,310
Okay.

3748
01:51:44,480 --> 01:51:45,000
Filipino.

3749
01:51:45,800 --> 01:51:46,300
There we go.

3750
01:51:50,580 --> 01:51:51,380
There we go.

3751
01:51:52,260 --> 01:51:52,780
It's okay.

3752
01:51:52,920 --> 01:51:52,940
It's okay.

3753
01:51:52,940 --> 01:51:53,420
I have one.

3754
01:51:53,780 --> 01:51:54,220
All right.

3755
01:51:54,380 --> 01:51:55,100
And then I'll color it.

3756
01:51:55,420 --> 01:51:56,680
That's the only thing I'll color.

3757
01:51:59,620 --> 01:52:00,020
Yeah.

3758
01:52:00,460 --> 01:52:01,220
This is my fault.

3759
01:52:07,700 --> 01:52:08,100
Okay.

3760
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:09,580
Maybe we can look...

3761
01:52:10,500 --> 01:52:10,900
Wait.

3762
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:11,640
People don't...

3763
01:52:11,640 --> 01:52:12,160
Oh my God.

3764
01:52:12,300 --> 01:52:14,300
My chat doesn't even know how to spell Filipino.

3765
01:52:14,300 --> 01:52:17,560
Like, they keep giving me wrong at me.

3766
01:52:18,160 --> 01:52:18,980
They're like, no.

3767
01:52:19,660 --> 01:52:19,780
Stop.

3768
01:52:20,120 --> 01:52:21,640
I'm like, I was just listening to chat.

3769
01:52:22,060 --> 01:52:23,680
So I did spell it right.

3770
01:52:24,620 --> 01:52:25,780
I spelled it right.

3771
01:52:26,360 --> 01:52:26,460
Okay.

3772
01:52:26,660 --> 01:52:26,840
You ready?

3773
01:52:27,580 --> 01:52:28,520
Give me a sec.

3774
01:52:28,600 --> 01:52:29,200
Let me...

3775
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:30,280
Okay.

3776
01:52:31,020 --> 01:52:33,460
Let me snip this real quick before...

3777
01:52:38,540 --> 01:52:40,240
I'm just snipping it real quick.

3778
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:42,340
I'm just trying to snip it.

3779
01:52:43,460 --> 01:52:45,000
All right, I'm ready.

3780
01:52:47,860 --> 01:52:48,880
Okay.

3781
01:52:49,700 --> 01:52:50,000
Hey.

3782
01:52:50,600 --> 01:52:50,780
Yeah.

3783
01:52:56,120 --> 01:52:58,780
Oh my God.

3784
01:53:00,060 --> 01:53:01,860
You're a Filipina, Harry.

3785
01:53:02,320 --> 01:53:03,380
I'm a what?

3786
01:53:13,820 --> 01:53:14,660
Oh my God.

3787
01:53:14,780 --> 01:53:15,460
You're so smart.

3788
01:53:15,620 --> 01:53:17,760
You put like his dead fish on his shirt.

3789
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:20,440
Oh yeah.

3790
01:53:20,680 --> 01:53:21,480
That's a fish.

3791
01:53:21,640 --> 01:53:21,700
Yep.

3792
01:53:23,860 --> 01:53:25,480
Can I ask about your neck?

3793
01:53:26,240 --> 01:53:27,180
Oh, my neck?

3794
01:53:27,380 --> 01:53:27,820
Oh yeah.

3795
01:53:28,120 --> 01:53:28,440
Oh yeah.

3796
01:53:28,580 --> 01:53:29,120
They're just...

3797
01:53:29,120 --> 01:53:30,200
They're all so long, you know?

3798
01:53:30,200 --> 01:53:31,360
Yeah, because it's like...

3799
01:53:31,360 --> 01:53:33,500
It's to hold up the head better.

3800
01:53:34,100 --> 01:53:34,820
You know?

3801
01:53:35,040 --> 01:53:35,640
Makes sense.

3802
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:36,960
You know how he's like...

3803
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:37,920
He's like smart.

3804
01:53:38,380 --> 01:53:39,220
And everything.

3805
01:53:39,600 --> 01:53:41,460
So like he needs a proper support structure.

3806
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:42,240
Massive brain.

3807
01:53:42,460 --> 01:53:43,360
Yeah, to support...

3808
01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:43,540
Yeah.

3809
01:53:43,580 --> 01:53:44,780
You know, support the five head.

3810
01:53:47,180 --> 01:53:47,880
Got it.

3811
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:53,180
He said his hair is like Harry Potter.

3812
01:53:53,940 --> 01:53:54,460
It's Filipino.

3813
01:53:54,460 --> 01:53:55,180
No, no.

3814
01:53:55,440 --> 01:53:55,980
That was...

3815
01:53:55,980 --> 01:53:57,260
No, it's Filipino, Harry Potter.

3816
01:53:58,240 --> 01:53:59,480
That's all I got.

3817
01:53:59,480 --> 01:54:01,560
God, you said Filipino, Harry Potter.

3818
01:54:01,920 --> 01:54:02,540
You did great.

3819
01:54:02,720 --> 01:54:03,220
You did great.

3820
01:54:03,740 --> 01:54:04,600
You did wonderful.

3821
01:54:04,600 --> 01:54:05,760
That's all I can remember.

3822
01:54:06,240 --> 01:54:06,600
Don't worry.

3823
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:07,220
That's great.

3824
01:54:07,800 --> 01:54:08,180
All right.

3825
01:54:08,380 --> 01:54:08,560
Okay.

3826
01:54:08,940 --> 01:54:09,780
Your chat's turn.

3827
01:54:13,320 --> 01:54:13,720
Okay.

3828
01:54:13,940 --> 01:54:14,200
All right.

3829
01:54:14,440 --> 01:54:14,680
Um.

3830
01:54:14,980 --> 01:54:16,320
I like how you gave him leg hair.

3831
01:54:17,300 --> 01:54:18,280
That's a good...

3832
01:54:18,280 --> 01:54:18,640
That's...

3833
01:54:18,640 --> 01:54:20,180
That's great attention to detail.

3834
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:21,980
If you told me he had leg hair...

3835
01:54:21,980 --> 01:54:22,500
I think...

3836
01:54:22,500 --> 01:54:24,320
I would have done it too.

3837
01:54:24,680 --> 01:54:25,080
If I knew.

3838
01:54:26,660 --> 01:54:29,000
Ask Doki for a neck toggle.

3839
01:54:29,340 --> 01:54:30,360
Oh my God.

3840
01:54:30,980 --> 01:54:31,200
Wait, no.

3841
01:54:31,300 --> 01:54:32,420
I showed it to you, didn't I?

3842
01:54:33,040 --> 01:54:33,840
During the podcast?

3843
01:54:35,780 --> 01:54:37,720
Didn't I show it to you during the podcast?

3844
01:54:38,680 --> 01:54:39,800
A neck toggle?

3845
01:54:40,040 --> 01:54:40,240
Yeah.

3846
01:54:40,500 --> 01:54:40,900
This one.

3847
01:54:41,340 --> 01:54:42,080
Wait, is it this one?

3848
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:43,140
Yeah.

3849
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:46,620
Did I show...

3850
01:54:46,620 --> 01:54:47,900
I thought I did.

3851
01:54:48,260 --> 01:54:48,940
Did you show...

3852
01:54:48,940 --> 01:54:50,160
I don't remember it.

3853
01:54:50,420 --> 01:54:50,860
There's so many.

3854
01:54:51,060 --> 01:54:52,220
I don't remember you showing me this.

3855
01:54:52,360 --> 01:54:54,240
So many things happened within that hour.

3856
01:54:54,580 --> 01:54:54,860
Wow.

3857
01:54:55,160 --> 01:54:55,320
You...

3858
01:54:55,760 --> 01:54:57,120
You got such a long...

3859
01:54:57,120 --> 01:54:57,680
Oh, wow.

3860
01:54:57,840 --> 01:54:58,560
That's really good.

3861
01:54:58,740 --> 01:54:59,460
Really good neck.

3862
01:54:59,640 --> 01:54:59,740
Yeah.

3863
01:55:02,460 --> 01:55:05,340
You see, you know like artists draw from real life experiences?

3864
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:09,580
All right.

3865
01:55:09,760 --> 01:55:10,020
All right.

3866
01:55:10,500 --> 01:55:11,560
Your chat's turn.

3867
01:55:12,820 --> 01:55:13,300

01:55:41,940 --> 01:55:42,460
Garfield.

3881
01:55:42,640 --> 01:55:43,220
Let's do Garfield.

3882
01:55:43,280 --> 01:55:43,600

01:55:43,800 --> 01:55:44,500
Oh, man.

01:55:48,620 --> 01:55:49,840
That's my Oshie.

3886
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:50,400
That's a great Oshie.

3888
01:55:52,040 --> 01:55:53,360
Okay, Garfield.

You need help.

3893
01:56:00,120 --> 01:56:01,000
He's orange.

3894
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:02,640
If you need help, don't worry.

3895
01:56:02,680 --> 01:56:03,260
I got you.

3896
01:56:03,940 --> 01:56:05,060
He has...

3897
01:56:05,060 --> 01:56:06,120
Eyes that are...

3898
01:56:06,120 --> 01:56:08,060
He's like...

3899
01:56:08,060 --> 01:56:09,760
His eyes are like...

3900
01:56:09,760 --> 01:56:11,740
It's like when his eyes looks like when...

3901
01:56:11,740 --> 01:56:12,580
You know, like...

01:56:12,580 --> 01:56:13,720
The half-biddled eyes.

3903
01:56:14,580 --> 01:56:15,660
Oh, yes.

3904
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:16,380
Yeah.

3905
01:56:17,560 --> 01:56:18,440
Because he's like...

3906
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:21,880
And then...

3907
01:56:21,880 --> 01:56:22,420
Oh, my gosh.

3908
01:56:22,440 --> 01:56:23,500
I'm not sober.

3909
01:56:23,660 --> 01:56:24,120
I can tell.

3910
01:56:24,260 --> 01:56:24,760
Oh, my...

3911
01:56:24,760 --> 01:56:25,580
I don't...

3912
01:56:25,580 --> 01:56:26,820
I don't know how to...

3913
01:56:26,820 --> 01:56:28,160
It's just a chill...

3914
01:56:28,160 --> 01:56:29,820
Okay, you know, I'm just gonna do my interpretation.

3915
01:56:29,980 --> 01:56:30,500
He's just a chill...

3916
01:56:30,500 --> 01:56:30,640
Yeah.

3917
01:56:37,500 --> 01:56:38,080
Oh, my God.

3918
01:56:38,260 --> 01:56:39,840
I can tell I'm not sober anymore.

3919
01:56:46,280 --> 01:56:49,020
I can tell I'm not sober anymore.

3920
01:56:50,380 --> 01:56:51,260
And then...

3921
01:56:52,460 --> 01:56:53,140
He's just like...

3922
01:56:53,140 --> 01:56:54,260
I'm sorry, John.

3923
01:56:55,300 --> 01:56:56,740
Oh, I'm sorry, John.

3924
01:56:56,760 --> 01:56:58,260
I used to love that subreddit.

3925
01:56:59,300 --> 01:57:00,000
And he has like...

3926
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:00,340
Is he still active?

3927
01:57:01,080 --> 01:57:01,520
Hmm?

3928
01:57:01,640 --> 01:57:03,400
Yeah, it's like a stomach because he's fat.

3929
01:57:08,060 --> 01:57:09,240
Sorry, he's big bone.

3930
01:57:17,770 --> 01:57:19,150
Okay, and then...

3931
01:57:20,310 --> 01:57:21,990
He likes lasagna.

3932
01:57:22,290 --> 01:57:23,030
Yeah, he does.

3933
01:57:23,470 --> 01:57:24,290
The lasagna.

3934
01:57:25,930 --> 01:57:27,810
Where's the lasagna, John?

3935
01:57:28,830 --> 01:57:30,110
Where is it?

3936
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:35,680
Okay.

3937
01:57:36,940 --> 01:57:38,760
And he has like big paws.

3938
01:57:39,720 --> 01:57:40,480
Big paws?

3939
01:57:40,740 --> 01:57:40,960
Yeah.

3940
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:42,080
Oh, God.

3941
01:57:42,100 --> 01:57:42,620
I don't remember.

3942
01:57:42,920 --> 01:57:43,340
Okay.

3943
01:57:44,760 --> 01:57:45,100
And...

3944
01:57:45,860 --> 01:57:46,540
Uh...

3945
01:57:46,540 --> 01:57:48,320
He has...

3946
01:57:48,320 --> 01:57:50,200
He has like...

3947
01:57:50,200 --> 01:57:51,320
He's like a little...

3948
01:57:51,320 --> 01:57:52,240
He's like a tablet.

3949
01:57:52,240 --> 01:57:53,440
Tabby with the black...

3950
01:57:53,440 --> 01:57:55,260
The black stuff on him.

3951
01:58:00,420 --> 01:58:02,360
He has like black stripes everywhere.

3952
01:58:04,820 --> 01:58:05,960
Okay, he is strange.

3953
01:58:05,960 --> 01:58:06,860
Because he's a tabby.

3954
01:58:09,420 --> 01:58:10,380
And then...

3955
01:58:11,360 --> 01:58:12,320
And then...

3956
01:58:12,320 --> 01:58:13,660
It's like a Pikachu, you know?

3957
01:58:13,820 --> 01:58:14,720
With the black stripes.

3958
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:15,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3959
01:58:15,660 --> 01:58:16,540
Lots of black stripes.

3960
01:58:16,840 --> 01:58:17,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3961
01:58:17,680 --> 01:58:18,340
Like a tiger.

3962
01:58:18,940 --> 01:58:19,220
Like...

3963
01:58:19,220 --> 01:58:20,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3964
01:58:20,320 --> 01:58:21,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3965
01:58:21,120 --> 01:58:21,620
No worries.

3966
01:58:26,140 --> 01:58:27,280
Does he have...

3967
01:58:27,280 --> 01:58:28,720
Does he have eyebrows?

3968
01:58:28,960 --> 01:58:29,640
I don't remember.

3969
01:58:30,280 --> 01:58:31,780
I don't remember.

3970
01:58:32,060 --> 01:58:32,720
Does he?

3971
01:58:32,940 --> 01:58:34,520
Just gonna draw...

3972
01:58:35,460 --> 01:58:40,280
I don't remember he has eyebrows.

3973
01:58:40,520 --> 01:58:41,620
Guys, does he have eyebrows?

3974
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:44,720
Fake fan.

3975
01:58:47,660 --> 01:58:50,100
Guys, the eyebrows is the last thing I remember.

3976
01:58:52,840 --> 01:58:53,240
Yes.

3977
01:58:53,400 --> 01:58:54,620
Oh yeah, he has bushy straw.

3978
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:55,440
Oh my God, you're right.

3979
01:58:55,620 --> 01:58:56,380
I remember now.

3980
01:58:57,320 --> 01:58:58,100
It's like that.

3981
01:58:58,340 --> 01:58:59,020
And then he's like...

3982
01:58:59,020 --> 01:59:00,020
Fuck...

3983
01:59:00,580 --> 01:59:01,120
Fuck...

3984
01:59:02,600 --> 01:59:03,680
Odie...

3985
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:05,140
Where's the lasagna, John?

3986
01:59:05,480 --> 01:59:06,980
Where's the lasagna?

3987
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:08,220
Okay.

3988
01:59:09,860 --> 01:59:11,000
And then...

3989
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:12,460
It's like...

3990
01:59:12,460 --> 01:59:13,180
Oopsies.

3991
01:59:13,560 --> 01:59:14,200
Oopsies.

3992
01:59:14,380 --> 01:59:15,220
It's like...

3993
01:59:16,500 --> 01:59:17,460
Big belly.

3994
01:59:17,880 --> 01:59:19,100
Alright, I think...

3995
01:59:19,600 --> 01:59:21,820
This Garfield looks big.

3996
01:59:26,340 --> 01:59:28,980
He looks so tired, he is.

3997
01:59:29,680 --> 01:59:30,080
You know what?

3998
01:59:30,140 --> 01:59:30,460
You're right.

3999
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:33,080
My Garfield looks so tired, too.

4000
01:59:33,260 --> 01:59:34,440
Okay, Garfield is like, what?

4001
01:59:34,540 --> 01:59:35,240
30 already?

4002
01:59:35,400 --> 01:59:36,760
No, he's like 40, right?

4003
01:59:38,600 --> 01:59:39,780
Look, he's middle age.

4004
01:59:40,440 --> 01:59:42,060
He's middle age right now.

4005
01:59:43,780 --> 01:59:45,260
He's a middle age man.

4006
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:47,080
He's been through a lot.

4007
01:59:47,540 --> 01:59:48,700
He has a 9 to 5.

4008
01:59:48,920 --> 01:59:49,300
You're right.

4009
01:59:49,460 --> 01:59:49,780
He does.

4010
01:59:50,160 --> 01:59:51,320
Let me give him a suitcase.

4011
01:59:53,940 --> 01:59:55,000
He's off to work.

4012
01:59:55,560 --> 01:59:56,420
He's got...

4013
01:59:56,420 --> 01:59:57,560
It looks like it's Monday's.

4014
01:59:58,140 --> 01:59:58,240
He's on status.

4015
01:59:59,560 --> 02:00:01,540
It's Monday's for Garfield right now.

4016
02:00:04,300 --> 02:00:05,100
There you go.

4017
02:00:05,300 --> 02:00:07,060
He's ready to go to his 9 to 5.

4018
02:00:15,760 --> 02:00:16,200
Alright.

4019
02:00:16,920 --> 02:00:17,560
I'm done.

4020
02:00:17,720 --> 02:00:18,140
What about you?

4021
02:00:18,800 --> 02:00:19,600
Oh, I'm...

4022
02:00:19,600 --> 02:00:20,200
Yeah, I'm done.

4023
02:00:20,340 --> 02:00:20,560
I'm done.

4024
02:00:20,780 --> 02:00:21,140
Alright.

4025
02:00:23,380 --> 02:00:24,020
Alright.

4026
02:00:30,530 --> 02:00:31,170
Okay.

4027
02:00:31,470 --> 02:00:32,850
Well, you went completely different.

4028
02:00:33,390 --> 02:00:35,710
Yours just looked like a regular cat.

4029
02:00:36,510 --> 02:00:37,830
What made it?

4030
02:00:39,750 --> 02:00:41,050
I'm gonna look up Garfield.

4031
02:00:42,010 --> 02:00:42,530
I just...

4032
02:00:42,530 --> 02:00:43,770
I just ruined his eyes.

4033
02:00:46,330 --> 02:00:46,970
Oh...

4034
02:00:46,970 --> 02:00:48,530
Oh my God.

4035
02:00:48,530 --> 02:00:50,430
Wow, I could not have gotten that.

4036
02:00:50,810 --> 02:00:54,370
Oh my god, you guys lied to me about the eyebrows!

4037
02:00:54,850 --> 02:00:56,350
This is Garfield?

4038
02:01:00,470 --> 02:01:02,760
Okay, I was... it was very close.

4039
02:01:03,350 --> 02:01:04,170
He's so shapely.

4040
02:01:04,530 --> 02:01:06,050
I told you, he's, like, fat.

4041
02:01:07,850 --> 02:01:10,690
I mean, like, all he does is eat lasagna.

4042
02:01:11,150 --> 02:01:11,850
That's true.

4043
02:01:12,230 --> 02:01:13,190
That's all he does.

4044
02:01:13,570 --> 02:01:15,110
Oh, I got the big feet, right?

4045
02:01:15,650 --> 02:01:16,990
See, I remember feet.

4046
02:01:16,990 --> 02:01:18,330
The eyeball.

4047
02:01:23,950 --> 02:01:25,890
I remember feet.

4048
02:01:26,010 --> 02:01:26,750
Oh, I'm hungry.

4049
02:01:27,010 --> 02:01:27,790
I want lasagna.

4050
02:01:28,030 --> 02:01:31,410
Oh, you should... oh, I did not eat while I was, like, before I drank.

4051
02:01:33,010 --> 02:01:34,570
Oh, that looks so good.

4052
02:01:35,050 --> 02:01:36,410
Yeah, you should order lasagna.

4053
02:01:36,870 --> 02:01:37,190
Do it.

4054
02:01:37,310 --> 02:01:39,370
I might actually order lasagna.

4055
02:01:39,370 --> 02:01:39,750
Do it.

4056
02:01:40,650 --> 02:01:41,830
What's stopping you?

4057
02:01:42,850 --> 02:01:46,470
You're, like, the devil on my shoulder.

4058
02:01:54,550 --> 02:01:55,910
Cut it from the back of his head.

4059
02:01:56,070 --> 02:01:56,690
He'll never notice.

4060
02:01:57,850 --> 02:01:58,490
He might.

4061
02:01:58,710 --> 02:01:59,470
Why would he notice?

4062
02:02:00,050 --> 02:02:01,670
No one looks at the back of his head.

4063
02:02:01,710 --> 02:02:02,430
What if you run your hair through...

4064
02:02:02,430 --> 02:02:06,170
Like, wouldn't you notice, like, a top of hair missing if you run your hand through your hair?

4065
02:02:06,170 --> 02:02:07,190
But does he do that?

4066
02:02:11,070 --> 02:02:11,930
Yeah, exactly.

4067
02:02:12,310 --> 02:02:12,690
You're Scott.

4068
02:02:12,930 --> 02:02:16,670
And I'm pretty sure there's no way he's gonna be looking through your vids.

4069
02:02:17,790 --> 02:02:18,530
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

4070
02:02:18,610 --> 02:02:19,910
I don't... I think he's super busy right now.

4071
02:02:20,490 --> 02:02:21,150
Yeah, there's no way.

4072
02:02:21,450 --> 02:02:21,750
Yeah.

4073
02:02:21,770 --> 02:02:22,810
You're, like, in the clear.

4074
02:02:22,930 --> 02:02:23,670
I mean...

4075
02:02:23,670 --> 02:02:25,370
Are you sure I should...

4076
02:02:25,370 --> 02:02:26,190
Are you sure I should...

4077
02:02:26,190 --> 02:02:26,930
Are you sure I should...

4078
02:02:26,930 --> 02:02:27,170
It would be such a...

4079
02:02:27,170 --> 02:02:28,850
It would be such a good stream idea.

4080
02:02:29,010 --> 02:02:29,650
Think about it.

4081
02:02:30,190 --> 02:02:32,210
Oh, I guess when you put it that way...

4082
02:02:32,210 --> 02:02:32,290
Yeah.

4083
02:02:32,290 --> 02:02:33,870
It could be really funny content, huh?

4084
02:02:34,290 --> 02:02:34,630
Exactly.

4085
02:02:35,010 --> 02:02:35,190
Exactly.

4086
02:02:35,730 --> 02:02:36,030
Yeah, yeah.

4087
02:02:36,170 --> 02:02:37,670
Just, like, do it as, like...

4088
02:02:37,670 --> 02:02:39,570
And then, like, give it to him on his birthday.

4089
02:02:39,870 --> 02:02:40,950
On your birthday, too.

4090
02:02:41,050 --> 02:02:41,890
Oh, yeah, my god.

4091
02:02:41,890 --> 02:02:43,030
You should give him...

4092
02:02:43,030 --> 02:02:44,570
Yeah, give him a voodoo doll first.

4093
02:02:44,570 --> 02:02:45,730
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4094
02:02:46,670 --> 02:02:47,790
There you go, honey.

4095
02:02:48,050 --> 02:02:48,730
There you go.

4096
02:02:49,050 --> 02:02:49,770
I made you a little...

4097
02:02:49,770 --> 02:02:50,350
Don't piss me off.

4098
02:02:50,470 --> 02:02:51,350
I have a second one.

4099
02:02:53,730 --> 02:02:55,330
I have to cut out so much hair.

4100
02:02:56,610 --> 02:02:58,890
I can make another one if you piss me off.

4101
02:03:03,450 --> 02:03:05,090
Oh, Garrett, what's a loopy doll?

4102
02:03:05,450 --> 02:03:05,910
Oh, god.

4103
02:03:06,050 --> 02:03:07,110
Oh, my god, that's so nice.

4104
02:03:07,590 --> 02:03:07,750
Yeah?

4105
02:03:08,470 --> 02:03:09,910
No, you know the loopy doll, right?

4106
02:03:10,030 --> 02:03:10,850
What's a loopy doll?

4107
02:03:11,150 --> 02:03:12,110
Oh, my god.

4108
02:03:12,350 --> 02:03:13,770
The fucking...

4109
02:03:13,770 --> 02:03:17,610
Girls who look like this have permission to ruin my life thing.

4110
02:03:17,750 --> 02:03:19,110
Here, I'm gonna place it on there.

4111
02:03:19,250 --> 02:03:19,470
Wait, what?

4112
02:03:21,110 --> 02:03:22,270
Oh, this one.

4113
02:03:22,370 --> 02:03:23,390
The one that looks like you.

4114
02:03:23,930 --> 02:03:24,610
Shut up.

4115
02:03:25,310 --> 02:03:26,210
Oh, my god.

4116
02:03:26,890 --> 02:03:27,550
You should...

4117
02:03:27,550 --> 02:03:28,110
It's tagged.

4118
02:03:28,390 --> 02:03:29,830
I get tagged every time.

4119
02:03:31,610 --> 02:03:32,490
You should...

4120
02:03:32,490 --> 02:03:34,250
You make the little voodoo doll.

4121
02:03:34,450 --> 02:03:35,310
The voodoo doll.

4122
02:03:35,350 --> 02:03:36,770
You should put it next to the...

4123
02:03:36,770 --> 02:03:37,350
That doll.

4124
02:03:37,590 --> 02:03:38,430
Yeah, the loopy doll.

4125
02:03:38,450 --> 02:03:39,310
The loopy doll.

4126
02:03:39,310 --> 02:03:40,170
Oh, my god.

4127
02:03:40,330 --> 02:03:41,050
It would be so...

4128
02:03:41,050 --> 02:03:42,530
And then you can have a little...

4129
02:03:42,530 --> 02:03:45,150
You can do like a little photo shoot with them.

4130
02:03:46,210 --> 02:03:47,790
Actually, that's such a cute idea.

4131
02:03:48,970 --> 02:03:49,690
Oh, god.

4132
02:03:51,650 --> 02:03:52,350
Oh, my god.

4133
02:03:52,410 --> 02:03:53,050
And this one, they...

4134
02:03:53,050 --> 02:03:53,730
I didn't notice.

4135
02:03:53,730 --> 02:03:55,730
They gave her eyelashes, too.

4136
02:03:55,890 --> 02:03:56,050
Wait.

4137
02:03:56,070 --> 02:03:56,890
That's crazy.

4138
02:03:57,870 --> 02:03:59,350
Wait, I drew a sexy bee?

4139
02:03:59,350 --> 02:04:01,310
When did I...

4140
02:04:01,310 --> 02:04:02,490
When did I...

4141
02:04:02,490 --> 02:04:03,110
When did I do that?

4142
02:04:03,370 --> 02:04:03,910
When did I do that?

4143
02:04:03,910 --> 02:04:04,650
Holy shit.

4144
02:04:05,350 --> 02:04:06,510
I think...

4145
02:04:06,510 --> 02:04:07,850
Wait, look at this.

4146
02:04:08,270 --> 02:04:08,610
Like...

4147
02:04:08,910 --> 02:04:09,490
An art...

4148
02:04:09,490 --> 02:04:10,190
I was like...

4149
02:04:10,190 --> 02:04:11,630
I was looking at my Twitter notification.

4150
02:04:12,210 --> 02:04:12,790
And...

4151
02:04:12,790 --> 02:04:13,730
One of like...

4152
02:04:13,730 --> 02:04:14,190
The art...

4153
02:04:14,190 --> 02:04:17,530
A Korean artist I follow...

4154
02:04:17,530 --> 02:04:18,430
Um...

4155
02:04:18,430 --> 02:04:18,830
Like...

4156
02:04:18,830 --> 02:04:19,310
Liked...

4157
02:04:19,310 --> 02:04:20,810
One of my old artwork.

4158
02:04:21,010 --> 02:04:21,290
And I was like...

4159
02:04:21,290 --> 02:04:22,470
How did she find...

4160
02:04:22,470 --> 02:04:24,670
How did she find this?

4161
02:04:26,150 --> 02:04:26,590
Wait.

4162
02:04:26,930 --> 02:04:27,670
This is what it looks like.

4163
02:04:28,670 --> 02:04:29,050
Oh.

4164
02:04:29,110 --> 02:04:30,090
She's extra sick.

4165
02:04:30,230 --> 02:04:30,430
Whoa.

4166
02:04:30,750 --> 02:04:31,650
What happened to me?

4167
02:04:31,770 --> 02:04:32,570
I used to...

4168
02:04:33,130 --> 02:04:34,230
This is really good.

4169
02:04:34,570 --> 02:04:34,790
Yeah.

4170
02:04:34,790 --> 02:04:35,410
I was like...

4171
02:04:35,410 --> 02:04:35,590
Wait.

4172
02:04:35,730 --> 02:04:36,630
I can draw...

4173
02:04:36,630 --> 02:04:37,150
Wait.

4174
02:04:37,530 --> 02:04:38,130
Oh, my...

4175
02:04:38,130 --> 02:04:39,150
I drew this?

4176
02:04:39,250 --> 02:04:39,830
Wait.

4177
02:04:40,330 --> 02:04:41,930
What happened to me?

4178
02:04:42,110 --> 02:04:42,190
It's really sexy.

4179
02:04:42,230 --> 02:04:42,550
Yeah.

4180
02:04:42,890 --> 02:04:44,450
What happened to me?

4181
02:04:46,530 --> 02:04:48,310
You start practice again.

4182
02:04:48,690 --> 02:04:51,550
I do not remember me being able to draw stuff like that.

4183
02:04:52,010 --> 02:04:52,110
Yeah.

4184
02:04:52,930 --> 02:04:53,250
I...

4185
02:04:53,250 --> 02:04:54,970
I drew this, guys.

4186
02:04:55,150 --> 02:04:55,570
I'm gonna make this for you.

4187
02:04:55,870 --> 02:04:56,970
Look at...

4188
02:04:56,970 --> 02:04:58,010
Look at...

4189
02:04:58,010 --> 02:04:58,170
My...

4190
02:04:58,170 --> 02:04:59,330
My sexy bee.

4191
02:04:59,810 --> 02:05:01,150
My thick, sexy bee.

4192
02:05:01,330 --> 02:05:02,470
Next to my Garfield.

4193
02:05:08,170 --> 02:05:09,670
Doki, what happened?

4194
02:05:10,370 --> 02:05:13,030
No, it's because we're doing it so fast right now, you know?

4195
02:05:13,290 --> 02:05:13,430
That's so true.

4196
02:05:13,590 --> 02:05:14,130
That's so true.

4197
02:05:14,430 --> 02:05:16,290
I think if you take your time, you can actually like...

4198
02:05:16,290 --> 02:05:17,410
You can draw something really, really good.

4199
02:05:17,590 --> 02:05:18,170
Why don't we...

4200
02:05:18,170 --> 02:05:18,290
Okay.

4201
02:05:18,590 --> 02:05:19,730
What about for our last one?

4202
02:05:20,010 --> 02:05:20,170
Yeah.

4203
02:05:20,710 --> 02:05:23,310
Like, we just spend more time on it.

4204
02:05:23,650 --> 02:05:23,870
Okay.

4205
02:05:24,190 --> 02:05:24,230
Yeah.

4206
02:05:24,230 --> 02:05:25,630
That's a good art piece.

4207
02:05:26,210 --> 02:05:27,090
That's a good idea.

4208
02:05:27,270 --> 02:05:27,430
Alright.

4209
02:05:27,690 --> 02:05:28,910
We'll have...

4210
02:05:29,650 --> 02:05:30,010
Okay.

4211
02:05:30,290 --> 02:05:30,590
Okay.

4212
02:05:31,290 --> 02:05:32,590
We'll have the...

4213
02:05:33,170 --> 02:05:33,230
Okay, yeah.

4214
02:05:33,390 --> 02:05:33,770
Yeah.

4215
02:05:33,770 --> 02:05:34,550
Who do we pick it from?

4216
02:05:34,610 --> 02:05:35,750
Your chat or my chat?

4217
02:05:36,570 --> 02:05:37,650
Why don't we do each other?

4218
02:05:38,550 --> 02:05:39,590
We'll draw each other?

4219
02:05:39,690 --> 02:05:40,070
Okay.

4220
02:05:40,430 --> 02:05:42,590
Wait, but it's not for memory because I literally see you.

4221
02:05:43,150 --> 02:05:43,430
Yeah.

4222
02:05:43,830 --> 02:05:44,090
Oh.

4223
02:05:44,370 --> 02:05:44,990
Yeah, yeah.

4224
02:05:45,230 --> 02:05:45,770
It's just an art thing.

4225
02:05:45,970 --> 02:05:47,130
It's just an art thing.

4226
02:05:47,390 --> 02:05:47,710
Okay.

4227
02:05:48,490 --> 02:05:48,870
Okay.

4228
02:05:50,590 --> 02:05:51,890
Alright, I can do this.

4229
02:05:53,070 --> 02:05:54,230
Wait, what outfit though?

4230
02:05:54,430 --> 02:05:55,410
Should we swap out?

4231
02:05:55,530 --> 02:05:56,030
No, hold on.

4232
02:05:56,110 --> 02:05:57,030
Should we do a swap out?

4233
02:05:57,670 --> 02:05:58,710
Let me think, let me think.

4234
02:05:58,810 --> 02:05:59,030
Wait.

4235
02:05:59,190 --> 02:05:59,890
What do we do?

4236
02:06:00,990 --> 02:06:02,150
Design you a new outfit.

4237
02:06:02,530 --> 02:06:03,490
You can design me a new outfit?

4238
02:06:03,930 --> 02:06:04,810
I can't do that.

4239
02:06:04,890 --> 02:06:05,710
I'm too drunk for that.

4240
02:06:08,350 --> 02:06:08,970
I'm like...

4241
02:06:08,970 --> 02:06:10,970
I'm like pleasantly tipsy.

4242
02:06:10,990 --> 02:06:12,350
You know, I'm not like drunk drunk.

4243
02:06:12,810 --> 02:06:13,070
I'm good.

4244
02:06:13,410 --> 02:06:14,070
I'm at a good...

4245
02:06:14,070 --> 02:06:16,310
I'm trying to remember what was my old art style.

4246
02:06:17,030 --> 02:06:17,890
I think it was this?

4247
02:06:18,470 --> 02:06:19,250
I think so.

4248
02:06:20,110 --> 02:06:20,830
Oh my god.

4249
02:06:20,990 --> 02:06:21,870
I haven't drawn in so long.

4250
02:06:21,970 --> 02:06:23,790
I don't even remember what my old art style was like.

4251
02:06:24,150 --> 02:06:26,090
How did I draw her out?

4252
02:06:28,830 --> 02:06:31,490
I'm gonna change the resolution of this.

4253
02:06:31,650 --> 02:06:32,170
Just in case.

4254
02:06:35,150 --> 02:06:36,710
And then...

4255
02:06:36,710 --> 02:06:37,190
Okay.

4256
02:06:38,090 --> 02:06:38,670
Tomato?

4257
02:06:38,970 --> 02:06:39,350
Mm-mm.

4258
02:06:39,810 --> 02:06:40,050
Crow?

4259
02:06:40,450 --> 02:06:41,070
Mm.

4260
02:06:41,690 --> 02:06:43,410
And then...

4261
02:06:43,930 --> 02:06:44,330
Mm.

4262
02:06:44,990 --> 02:06:46,590
I'm just looking at your model.

4263
02:06:47,370 --> 02:06:48,510
I'm gonna cheat.

4264
02:06:49,290 --> 02:06:51,210
I'm looking at yours too, Jesse.

4265
02:06:52,630 --> 02:06:53,910
I'm looking...

4266
02:06:53,910 --> 02:06:54,910
Big eye.

4267
02:06:59,390 --> 02:07:00,310
Oh no.

4268
02:07:00,590 --> 02:07:01,230
Oh my god.

4269
02:07:01,290 --> 02:07:02,370
I missed my sketch brush.

4270
02:07:02,790 --> 02:07:04,310
I want my brushes back.

4271
02:07:05,490 --> 02:07:06,710
You're just using the default...

4272
02:07:07,350 --> 02:07:08,670
Side brushes too.

4273
02:07:11,810 --> 02:07:12,450
Okay.

4274
02:07:13,750 --> 02:07:15,350
I'm just gonna draw a GV.

4275
02:07:15,350 --> 02:07:16,190
Probably...

4276
02:07:16,910 --> 02:07:17,850
Oh, you're doing chibi?

4277
02:07:18,110 --> 02:07:18,390
Yeah.

4278
02:07:19,010 --> 02:07:20,830
I don't remember how to draw real pictures.

4279
02:07:23,290 --> 02:07:24,830
I don't remember how to draw like...

4280
02:07:24,830 --> 02:07:25,070
Not...

4281
02:07:25,070 --> 02:07:25,210
Sorry.

4282
02:07:25,630 --> 02:07:27,030
Chibi is also real, guys.

4283
02:07:27,310 --> 02:07:27,750
Chibi's...

4284
02:07:27,750 --> 02:07:28,430
Chibi's real.

4285
02:07:29,050 --> 02:07:29,710
Chibi's real.

4286
02:07:29,950 --> 02:07:30,470
I meant...

4287
02:07:30,470 --> 02:07:32,130
I don't remember how to draw like...

4288
02:07:32,130 --> 02:07:33,470
In a non-chibi format.

4289
02:07:35,930 --> 02:07:36,370
Wait.

4290
02:07:36,490 --> 02:07:37,230
Is yours a dress?

4291
02:07:37,690 --> 02:07:38,490
I'm just gonna...

4292
02:07:38,490 --> 02:07:39,130
It's gonna be a dress.

4293
02:07:39,510 --> 02:07:39,990
It's a dress.

4294
02:07:40,550 --> 02:07:40,770
Okay.

4295
02:07:41,050 --> 02:07:41,570
I didn't...

4296
02:07:41,570 --> 02:07:42,810
I didn't pay for full buy.

4297
02:07:42,810 --> 02:07:43,670
I just did bust up.

4298
02:07:43,810 --> 02:07:44,790
Cause I wanted to save money.

4299
02:07:44,910 --> 02:07:45,310
I mean, that's smart though.

4300
02:07:45,530 --> 02:07:46,270
That's so smart.

4301
02:07:46,290 --> 02:07:46,870
So I don't have a...

4302
02:07:46,870 --> 02:07:48,030
I don't have a body, okay?

4303
02:07:48,490 --> 02:07:48,790
Yeah.

4304
02:07:49,170 --> 02:07:50,570
We cut our legs off.

4305
02:07:52,730 --> 02:07:54,370
It was so much cheaper though.

4306
02:07:54,750 --> 02:07:55,070
Oh my god.

4307
02:07:55,070 --> 02:07:55,750
No, it is.

4308
02:07:55,910 --> 02:07:57,590
But like people don't see like...

4309
02:07:57,590 --> 02:07:58,770
They don't see it anyways.

4310
02:07:58,770 --> 02:07:59,070
Yeah.

4311
02:07:59,070 --> 02:08:00,010
It's so true.

4312
02:08:00,510 --> 02:08:01,430
They don't see it.

4313
02:08:03,330 --> 02:08:03,590
Hmm.

4314
02:08:03,790 --> 02:08:05,030
Let's see what kind of hair...

4315
02:08:05,030 --> 02:08:05,350
Wait.

4316
02:08:05,510 --> 02:08:05,730
Okay.

4317
02:08:06,110 --> 02:08:07,150
I'm gonna...

4318
02:08:07,150 --> 02:08:07,910
You know what?

4319
02:08:07,990 --> 02:08:08,170
Wait.

4320
02:08:08,590 --> 02:08:08,870
Wait.

4321
02:08:09,030 --> 02:08:09,630
I remember...

4322
02:08:10,410 --> 02:08:10,830
What?

4323
02:08:11,610 --> 02:08:11,950
What?

4324
02:08:12,130 --> 02:08:12,830
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

4325
02:08:13,010 --> 02:08:13,150
Wait.

4326
02:08:13,230 --> 02:08:13,610
What did you do?

4327
02:08:13,790 --> 02:08:15,230
Did you look up...

4328
02:08:15,230 --> 02:08:16,290
Ooh.

4329
02:08:17,330 --> 02:08:17,890
Ooh.

4330
02:08:18,710 --> 02:08:18,730
Ooh.

4331
02:08:18,730 --> 02:08:19,010
Ooh.

4332
02:08:20,290 --> 02:08:21,070
I'm gonna try and...

4333
02:08:21,070 --> 02:08:22,470
Find my old art style.

4334
02:08:22,630 --> 02:08:23,550
Maybe I can like...

4335
02:08:23,550 --> 02:08:24,450
Copy myself.

4336
02:08:25,570 --> 02:08:27,090
I'll trace myself.

4337
02:08:27,510 --> 02:08:29,790
It's not tracing if it's from myself.

4338
02:08:30,130 --> 02:08:31,090
Five years ago.

4339
02:08:33,330 --> 02:08:34,170
Oh my god.

4340
02:08:34,170 --> 02:08:34,990
You still got it.

4341
02:08:35,210 --> 02:08:37,030
How did I draw like this before?

4342
02:08:37,390 --> 02:08:38,290
What the fuck?

4343
02:08:39,110 --> 02:08:41,490
You probably had so much more practice and stuff.

4344
02:08:41,850 --> 02:08:42,910
Oh my god.

4345
02:08:42,910 --> 02:08:44,230
I used to actually...

4346
02:08:45,310 --> 02:08:46,330
Be an artist.

4347
02:08:47,190 --> 02:08:47,630
Wow.

4348
02:08:49,450 --> 02:08:50,470
Hey, look at this.

4349
02:08:50,750 --> 02:08:51,610
I drew this.

4350
02:08:54,190 --> 02:08:55,130
Oh my god.

4351
02:08:55,270 --> 02:08:56,450
This is so cute, Doki.

4352
02:08:56,890 --> 02:08:57,530
This was...

4353
02:08:57,530 --> 02:09:00,210
This was not just six years ago, Doki.

4354
02:09:00,550 --> 02:09:02,910
You could sell this at a convention and I would try it.

4355
02:09:03,050 --> 02:09:03,110
I did too!

4356
02:09:03,810 --> 02:09:05,650
Yeah, it looks like a cute pin art.

4357
02:09:05,970 --> 02:09:07,510
Yeah, I sold this as a sticker.

4358
02:09:07,850 --> 02:09:08,410
Look at it.

4359
02:09:08,630 --> 02:09:09,110
You can still...

4360
02:09:09,110 --> 02:09:10,250
I know you can still draw.

4361
02:09:10,470 --> 02:09:10,810
You just got...

4362
02:09:10,810 --> 02:09:12,350
You're rusty, but if you keep drawing...

4363
02:09:12,990 --> 02:09:13,690
That's really good.

4364
02:09:13,730 --> 02:09:15,050
You don't just forget things like that.

4365
02:09:15,050 --> 02:09:17,110
Yeah, it's like riding a bicycle.

4366
02:09:17,550 --> 02:09:17,890
This was...

4367
02:09:17,890 --> 02:09:18,730
It really is!

4368
02:09:18,930 --> 02:09:20,170
Six years ago, Doki.

4369
02:09:20,930 --> 02:09:21,570
Right there.

4370
02:09:23,310 --> 02:09:24,370
I'm gonna...

4371
02:09:24,370 --> 02:09:25,630
I'm gonna trace myself.

4372
02:09:25,930 --> 02:09:26,430
That's a princess.

4373
02:09:30,770 --> 02:09:31,370
Okay.

4374
02:09:33,710 --> 02:09:34,310
Okay.

4375
02:09:35,810 --> 02:09:37,010
And then...

4376
02:09:37,010 --> 02:09:37,710
Alright.

4377
02:09:38,410 --> 02:09:39,390
Am I doing it?

4378
02:09:39,690 --> 02:09:41,010
I'm doing it, guys.

4379
02:09:42,330 --> 02:09:44,090
I think I'm doing it.

4380
02:09:48,260 --> 02:09:50,360
I don't know how to draw...

4381
02:09:50,360 --> 02:09:52,340
Oh, I gotta look up references or something.

4382
02:09:54,140 --> 02:09:54,740
Um...

4383
02:09:54,740 --> 02:09:57,460
I don't remember how I did the eyes and stuff.

4384
02:09:57,460 --> 02:09:57,540
I don't know.

4385
02:09:59,260 --> 02:10:00,760
Looking for like...

4386
02:10:00,760 --> 02:10:01,380
Looking for like...

4387
02:10:01,380 --> 02:10:02,780
Oh, I remember.

4388
02:10:02,980 --> 02:10:03,440
I would cheat.

4389
02:10:03,580 --> 02:10:06,820
I just draw one eye and then I like copy and paste it and then did perspective.

4390
02:10:08,620 --> 02:10:10,380
And then I did the...

4391
02:10:10,380 --> 02:10:12,120
Work smarter, not harder.

4392
02:10:13,740 --> 02:10:15,040
These are kinda cool.

4393
02:10:18,880 --> 02:10:19,720
And then...

4394
02:10:19,720 --> 02:10:20,820
Oh, these are too hard.

4395
02:10:21,560 --> 02:10:22,180
Oh.

4396
02:10:22,640 --> 02:10:23,840
I did this, guys.

4397
02:10:24,240 --> 02:10:25,480
This was my cheat method.

4398
02:10:27,570 --> 02:10:29,780
Cause I don't remember how to draw...

4399
02:10:29,780 --> 02:10:31,680
I don't know how to draw the other eye.

4400
02:10:32,820 --> 02:10:33,860
I do this.

4401
02:10:34,060 --> 02:10:34,820
And then...

4402
02:10:37,480 --> 02:10:38,680
I did this.

4403
02:10:39,460 --> 02:10:40,080
Okay.

4404
02:10:41,160 --> 02:10:43,080
And I'd be like, I did it.

4405
02:10:44,040 --> 02:10:44,980
I drew.

4406
02:10:49,120 --> 02:10:50,000
That's right.

4407
02:11:02,180 --> 02:11:03,240
Oh my god.

4408
02:11:03,600 --> 02:11:03,900
I did that.

4409
02:11:03,920 --> 02:11:05,120
Yeah, Princess Doki.

4410
02:11:05,480 --> 02:11:06,760
Princess Doki?

4411
02:11:07,260 --> 02:11:08,100
Princess Doki.

4412
02:11:08,840 --> 02:11:09,200
Whoa!

4413
02:11:10,200 --> 02:11:12,140
I'm gonna draw you like a...

4414
02:11:13,180 --> 02:11:14,300
I'm gonna...

4415
02:11:16,700 --> 02:11:18,560
I'm trying to draw the face now.

4416
02:11:20,400 --> 02:11:21,740
Oh my gosh, mate.

4417
02:11:24,140 --> 02:11:26,000
God, I hate drawing arms.

4418
02:11:26,440 --> 02:11:28,140
I'm just gonna draw it by the side.

4419
02:11:28,140 --> 02:11:28,600
That's fine.

4420
02:11:28,620 --> 02:11:29,480
You know what, that's...

4421
02:11:29,480 --> 02:11:30,040
That's...

4422
02:11:30,040 --> 02:11:31,260
We're not looking for perfection here.

4423
02:11:31,820 --> 02:11:33,140
Just draw this.

4424
02:11:34,080 --> 02:11:35,540
Eat your lasagna.

4425
02:11:36,920 --> 02:11:37,600
Lasagna.

4426
02:11:40,860 --> 02:11:41,540
Okay.

4427
02:11:41,980 --> 02:11:42,320
Alright.

4428
02:11:44,560 --> 02:11:45,920
And then...

4429
02:11:48,540 --> 02:11:49,320
Whoa.

4430
02:11:50,460 --> 02:11:51,860
How do I do hair?

4431
02:11:54,300 --> 02:11:54,980
That?

4432
02:11:57,080 --> 02:11:58,220
That's how I do hair?

4433
02:12:01,220 --> 02:12:02,100
And then...

4434
02:12:04,730 --> 02:12:05,390
And then...

4435
02:12:05,390 --> 02:12:07,350
I remember my style was I like to do this.

4436
02:12:09,510 --> 02:12:12,030
With my line art, because I thought it was cute.

4437
02:12:34,470 --> 02:12:35,350
Oh my god.

4438
02:12:42,050 --> 02:12:43,250
I hate your hair.

4439
02:12:45,510 --> 02:12:46,310
I hate your hair.

4440
02:12:46,310 --> 02:12:47,310
This is like silent.

4441
02:12:48,070 --> 02:12:49,390
I hate your hair.

4442
02:12:50,950 --> 02:12:52,310
I feel like...

4443
02:12:52,310 --> 02:12:54,290
I don't know how do I do this.

4444
02:12:54,790 --> 02:12:57,050
I didn't know how I did.

4445
02:12:57,770 --> 02:12:59,030
You got it!

4446
02:12:59,210 --> 02:13:01,290
Your old art is so good, man.

4447
02:13:01,290 --> 02:13:04,150
It would happen to me.

4448
02:13:04,310 --> 02:13:05,930
You just stopped drawing.

4449
02:13:06,230 --> 02:13:06,610
I don't know what happened to me.

4450
02:13:06,610 --> 02:13:07,570
That's all that happened.

4451
02:13:08,510 --> 02:13:08,670
That's all that happened.

4452
02:13:08,670 --> 02:13:09,850
You just gotta draw again.

4453
02:13:10,190 --> 02:13:10,650
No!

4454
02:13:12,510 --> 02:13:14,410
It's so hard though.

4455
02:13:15,430 --> 02:13:17,070
Drawing is so hard.

4456
02:13:17,710 --> 02:13:18,910
But it's so fun.

4457
02:13:24,870 --> 02:13:25,670
I'm washed.

4458
02:13:26,290 --> 02:13:27,050
I'm washed.

4459
02:13:27,190 --> 02:13:27,910
I'm washed in gaming and...

4460
02:13:33,170 --> 02:13:33,830
Oh my god.

4461
02:13:33,910 --> 02:13:34,210
That's it.

4462
02:13:34,310 --> 02:13:36,190
I'm fucking fixing my...

4463
02:13:36,650 --> 02:13:37,410
Rusty Doki.

4464
02:13:41,210 --> 02:13:41,790
It's okay.

4465
02:13:41,950 --> 02:13:42,490
There's my flip.

4466
02:13:42,570 --> 02:13:43,770
I was like, where the fuck is my...

4467
02:13:43,770 --> 02:13:44,490
Oh my god.

4468
02:13:44,830 --> 02:13:46,330
You know when you flip an artwork?

4469
02:13:46,330 --> 02:13:49,150
You flip your artwork and you're like, this does not look okay.

4470
02:13:49,890 --> 02:13:51,310
Dude, I do it all the time.

4471
02:13:51,490 --> 02:13:52,390
I flip it so much.

4472
02:13:52,530 --> 02:13:53,470
And people are always like...

4473
02:13:53,470 --> 02:13:55,470
If they don't draw or something, it's confusing.

4474
02:13:55,550 --> 02:13:56,590
Because I'm like, why do they keep...

4475
02:13:56,590 --> 02:13:57,550
Why do you always keep flipping?

4476
02:13:57,970 --> 02:13:59,850
I'm like, it helps so much.

4477
02:14:01,110 --> 02:14:01,530
It's...

4478
02:14:01,970 --> 02:14:02,750
So useful.

4479
02:14:03,150 --> 02:14:04,250
It's so useful.

4480
02:14:04,610 --> 02:14:05,850
It's so very useful.

4481
02:14:06,550 --> 02:14:06,890
Mhm.

4482
02:14:08,990 --> 02:14:09,410
Okay.

4483
02:14:13,800 --> 02:14:16,140
Life is not daijoubu right now.

4484
02:14:17,320 --> 02:14:18,380
It's not daijoubu.

4485
02:14:18,380 --> 02:14:19,260
It's gonna be daijoubu.

4486
02:14:19,440 --> 02:14:19,860
It's gonna be daijoubu.

4487
02:14:20,400 --> 02:14:20,960
Like...

4488
02:14:21,940 --> 02:14:24,680
I don't feel daijoubu right now.

4489
02:14:26,480 --> 02:14:27,820
Believe in yourself.

4490
02:14:28,120 --> 02:14:28,800
I don't.

4491
02:14:29,780 --> 02:14:31,160
You're crazy, man.

4492
02:14:31,300 --> 02:14:32,460
I don't know what to tell you anyway.

4493
02:14:35,100 --> 02:14:38,300
What do I do when I don't believe myself, Lily?

4494
02:14:38,820 --> 02:14:39,880
What do I do?

4495
02:14:40,420 --> 02:14:41,360
Who's gonna believe?

4496
02:14:43,620 --> 02:14:44,520
I don't believe.

4497
02:14:45,440 --> 02:14:45,600
I don't believe.

4498
02:14:45,600 --> 02:14:46,760
You'll believe in me?

4499
02:14:47,540 --> 02:14:48,020
Yeah.

4500
02:14:49,520 --> 02:14:50,940
That's a dumb thing to do.

4501
02:14:50,940 --> 02:14:51,680
I'm expecting great things.

4502
02:14:56,860 --> 02:14:57,540
Fucked up.

4503
02:15:00,440 --> 02:15:01,360
What color is...

4504
02:15:02,100 --> 02:15:02,980
What am I saying?

4505
02:15:03,100 --> 02:15:04,620
It's just gonna be pink anyway.

4506
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:05,440
I don't know.

4507
02:15:06,070 --> 02:15:06,920
You suck.

4508
02:15:07,200 --> 02:15:07,360
Yeah.

4509
02:15:10,480 --> 02:15:11,980
Are you okay, man?

4510
02:15:14,520 --> 02:15:15,860
Not okay.

4511
02:15:16,560 --> 02:15:17,620
She's not okay.

4512
02:15:21,660 --> 02:15:22,480
Alright.

4513
02:15:23,220 --> 02:15:24,520
She hates pink.

4514
02:15:25,850 --> 02:15:26,940
What's your favorite color?

4515
02:15:27,380 --> 02:15:27,720
Yellow.

4516
02:15:28,380 --> 02:15:29,500
That's why I'm blonde.

4517
02:15:30,200 --> 02:15:32,860
Of course, I should've... I should've guessed that one, sorry.

4518
02:15:33,940 --> 02:15:36,560
Okay, um, I sort of gave up at the bottom part.

4519
02:15:41,220 --> 02:15:42,540
Wait, why is it brown?

4520
02:15:43,580 --> 02:15:46,400
I actually used brown liner, when did that happen?

4521
02:15:55,740 --> 02:15:57,240
What is homage?

4522
02:16:05,340 --> 02:16:06,880
I know I'm cheating for this.

4523
02:16:08,360 --> 02:16:10,560
Alright, I learned this a long time ago.

4524
02:16:10,560 --> 02:16:12,780
Like, if you can't draw circles, just...

4525
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:15,120
Get a brush.

4526
02:16:15,580 --> 02:16:18,580
Make a long-ass circular blot.

4527
02:16:18,780 --> 02:16:20,740
And then get a smaller brush and then...

4528
02:16:21,100 --> 02:16:21,220
Eraser?

4529
02:16:21,320 --> 02:16:22,760
Yeah, or eraser.

4530
02:16:23,180 --> 02:16:23,620
I did it too.

4531
02:16:24,440 --> 02:16:26,000
Yeah, I learned that on Tumblr.

4532
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:27,960
You should draw on an iPad.

4533
02:16:29,160 --> 02:16:30,760
I feel like you like it a lot.

4534
02:16:31,280 --> 02:16:32,360
I tried to.

4535
02:16:32,900 --> 02:16:33,400
Really?

4536
02:16:33,800 --> 02:16:35,680
It is weird, I feel.

4537
02:16:35,960 --> 02:16:37,780
I feel weird drawing on an iPad.

4538
02:16:38,620 --> 02:16:39,500
It's a sense.

4539
02:16:39,620 --> 02:16:40,540
I think it's a sensitivity.

4540
02:16:42,960 --> 02:16:44,360
This feels weird to me.

4541
02:16:44,860 --> 02:16:45,340
Tablet.

4542
02:16:45,960 --> 02:16:47,340
I think it's because I draw...

4543
02:16:47,340 --> 02:16:49,000
I used to draw on a tablet for so long.

4544
02:16:49,160 --> 02:16:50,960
That like, it was just hard to...

4545
02:16:50,960 --> 02:16:52,080
What tablet this is?

4546
02:16:53,580 --> 02:16:54,060
Um...

4547
02:16:54,060 --> 02:16:54,680
A Wacom?

4548
02:16:54,900 --> 02:16:55,540
A Wacom?

4549
02:16:55,600 --> 02:16:55,940
Yeah.

4550
02:16:56,240 --> 02:16:57,480
Yeah, Wacom Wacom.

4551
02:16:57,580 --> 02:16:58,400
Wacom Wacom.

4552
02:16:58,400 --> 02:16:59,260
Wacom.

4553
02:17:07,660 --> 02:17:08,100
And...

4554
02:17:10,400 --> 02:17:13,020
Oh yeah, I would make layers for like, everything I...

4555
02:17:13,580 --> 02:17:15,380
Not everything, but like...

4556
02:17:15,380 --> 02:17:18,760
For a lot of like...

4557
02:17:20,240 --> 02:17:20,680
Um...

4558
02:17:21,620 --> 02:17:22,060
For...

4559
02:17:22,060 --> 02:17:24,500
Like, each line art, I guess.

4560
02:17:25,140 --> 02:17:25,320
Mhm.

4561
02:17:25,620 --> 02:17:26,780
Like, or each body part.

4562
02:17:26,980 --> 02:17:28,860
So if I fuck up, I don't have to erase everything.

4563
02:17:29,840 --> 02:17:31,000
That's pretty smart.

4564
02:17:31,240 --> 02:17:32,220
Just very tedious.

4565
02:17:32,760 --> 02:17:33,900
Yeah, it's more so...

4566
02:17:33,900 --> 02:17:38,320
Because it's like, you know, if I fuck up or something, I can just change it on that piece in general.

4567
02:17:39,040 --> 02:17:39,940
I don't have to worry about...

4568
02:17:40,760 --> 02:17:41,260
Redraw it.

4569
02:17:41,340 --> 02:17:44,220
Like, I don't have to worry about like, affecting other pieces of the artwork.

4570
02:17:47,480 --> 02:17:48,240
I'm lazy.

4571
02:17:50,640 --> 02:17:51,240
How so?

4572
02:17:52,280 --> 02:17:53,760
Oh, layer management stuff?

4573
02:17:54,720 --> 02:17:55,520
Oh, me too.

4574
02:17:55,660 --> 02:17:56,020
Don't worry.

4575
02:17:56,940 --> 02:17:59,100
And then I just merge everything together after.

4576
02:17:59,860 --> 02:18:00,740
Yeah, I do that too.

4577
02:18:00,840 --> 02:18:02,160
But I keep the original just in case.

4578
02:18:02,320 --> 02:18:03,460
Like, duplicate the file maybe.

4579
02:18:04,040 --> 02:18:04,320
Cool.

4580
02:18:05,020 --> 02:18:05,640
Yeah, that's smart.

4581
02:18:06,320 --> 02:18:06,500
Mhm.

4582
02:18:06,760 --> 02:18:07,340
Did I do that?

4583
02:18:07,400 --> 02:18:08,040
I don't remember.

4584
02:18:10,100 --> 02:18:10,820
I don't...

4585
02:18:11,240 --> 02:18:12,700
I don't remember if I did that.

4586
02:18:17,370 --> 02:18:18,030
How's your hair?

4587
02:18:18,170 --> 02:18:18,870
Oh, it's like this.

4588
02:18:31,980 --> 02:18:33,340
Is that how hair works?

4589
02:18:33,480 --> 02:18:34,000
I can't remember.

4590
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:35,040
What is that?

4591
02:18:35,560 --> 02:18:36,420
Is this...

4592
02:18:36,420 --> 02:18:38,360
Is this how hair works again, guys?

4593
02:18:38,360 --> 02:18:39,260
I like your...

4594
02:18:39,260 --> 02:18:41,140
Commentary difference for a lot.

4595
02:18:47,230 --> 02:18:47,970
Oh no.

4596
02:19:02,680 --> 02:19:03,200
Alright.

4597
02:19:03,660 --> 02:19:04,540
And then...

4598
02:19:19,440 --> 02:19:22,880
And then I'm gonna cheat and like, your other hand is like, behind your back.

4599
02:19:23,020 --> 02:19:23,840
Cause I can't be bothered.

4600
02:19:24,120 --> 02:19:26,220
I will do that all the time.

4601
02:19:26,220 --> 02:19:26,760
Yeah.

4602
02:19:27,240 --> 02:19:29,720
I don't wanna draw two hands, bro.

4603
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:31,180
Sometimes I don't even wanna draw one.

4604
02:19:31,260 --> 02:19:32,780
So both hands are behind the back.

4605
02:19:32,920 --> 02:19:34,280
And it gives like, this cute mirror.

4606
02:19:34,540 --> 02:19:35,200
Yeah, exactly.

4607
02:19:36,020 --> 02:19:36,820
Yeah, it's fine.

4608
02:19:37,060 --> 02:19:37,740
It's fine.

4609
02:19:38,140 --> 02:19:39,120
Yeah, it's fine.

4610
02:19:39,420 --> 02:19:40,080
Actually, I lied.

4611
02:19:40,200 --> 02:19:41,500
I didn't put your hands behind your back.

4612
02:19:45,180 --> 02:19:46,140
Okay, nevermind.

4613
02:19:56,340 --> 02:19:57,160
Okay.

4614
02:19:57,760 --> 02:19:58,660
What layer is this?

4615
02:19:58,700 --> 02:19:59,340
It's this layer.

4616
02:20:03,360 --> 02:20:04,520
And then...

4617
02:20:12,040 --> 02:20:13,440
And then...

4618
02:20:13,440 --> 02:20:16,560
I'm gonna cheat and grab this hand.

4619
02:20:16,760 --> 02:20:17,920
Copy and paste.

4620
02:20:18,380 --> 02:20:19,540
Move it here.

4621
02:20:20,860 --> 02:20:23,240
And then move it here.

4622
02:20:23,920 --> 02:20:25,400
That's so funny.

4623
02:20:28,120 --> 02:20:28,800
Yeah.

4624
02:20:30,160 --> 02:20:31,360
And it's like...

4625
02:20:31,360 --> 02:20:33,540
It's like I drew two different hands.

4626
02:20:33,880 --> 02:20:34,800
But I didn't.

4627
02:20:39,240 --> 02:20:41,020
Okay, not Princess Doki no more.

4628
02:20:41,320 --> 02:20:42,380
Princess Kroki now.

4629
02:20:42,600 --> 02:20:43,960
Princess Kroki?

4630
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:45,080
What did you do?

4631
02:20:47,960 --> 02:20:53,980
There you go.

4632
02:21:03,260 --> 02:21:03,900
Yeah.

4633
02:21:03,900 --> 02:21:05,300
It should have like this thing.

4634
02:21:06,260 --> 02:21:08,020
And I really feel like it should have like...

4635
02:21:09,520 --> 02:21:10,160
Yeah.

4636
02:21:12,360 --> 02:21:13,500
Like a hint.

4637
02:21:13,860 --> 02:21:14,320
Yeah.

4638
02:21:14,880 --> 02:21:15,320
Oh, yeah.

4639
02:21:15,740 --> 02:21:16,880
Oh, baby.

4640
02:21:24,210 --> 02:21:24,850
Uh...

4641
02:21:24,850 --> 02:21:25,150
Yeah.

4642
02:21:25,830 --> 02:21:26,630
Oh my god.

4643
02:21:26,770 --> 02:21:28,110
It's literally just your hair.

4644
02:21:28,890 --> 02:21:29,650
You're stupid.

4645
02:21:30,950 --> 02:21:31,590
What?

4646
02:21:32,070 --> 02:21:34,150
I mean, your beautiful hair.

4647
02:21:35,090 --> 02:21:35,370
Yeah.

4648
02:21:38,190 --> 02:21:39,250
Princess Kroki.

4649
02:21:41,390 --> 02:21:43,810
I need to sketch this out before I have to do this.

4650
02:21:44,710 --> 02:21:48,590
I'm gonna give her pink eyes.

4651
02:21:48,810 --> 02:21:49,190
Or like...

4652
02:21:49,650 --> 02:21:50,270
Red eyes.

4653
02:21:51,410 --> 02:21:53,430
Seems like a darker version, you know?

4654
02:21:55,170 --> 02:21:55,730
So...

4655
02:21:55,730 --> 02:21:56,550
Or like red eyes?

4656
02:21:57,170 --> 02:21:58,410
It's not evil.

4657
02:21:59,730 --> 02:22:00,290
Just...

4658
02:22:00,290 --> 02:22:01,270
Just what?

4659
02:22:01,970 --> 02:22:02,530
Mischievous.

4660
02:22:03,150 --> 02:22:03,510
Just...

4661
02:22:04,130 --> 02:22:06,710
She's the type of girl who'll just tell to your face.

4662
02:22:06,990 --> 02:22:07,290
Exactly.

4663
02:22:08,070 --> 02:22:08,770
Like what I tell you.

4664
02:22:08,790 --> 02:22:09,170
To cut the hair of someone.

4665
02:22:09,650 --> 02:22:10,010
Yeah.

4666
02:22:10,270 --> 02:22:10,410
Yeah, yeah.

4667
02:22:10,450 --> 02:22:11,670
To make a Buddha doll off them.

4668
02:22:11,850 --> 02:22:13,950
To order lasagna, even though you're on a diet.

4669
02:22:14,090 --> 02:22:14,770
You know, stuff like that.

4670
02:22:14,990 --> 02:22:15,070
Little stuff like that.

4671
02:22:15,070 --> 02:22:15,810
Do you order lasagna?

4672
02:22:16,750 --> 02:22:18,090
No, my phone's too...

4673
02:22:18,090 --> 02:22:20,530
My phone's been being used for VTube studio, so I can't...

4674
02:22:22,450 --> 02:22:23,170
I can't.

4675
02:22:23,170 --> 02:22:24,550
Just pause it for a little bit.

4676
02:22:24,550 --> 02:22:26,310
No, I gotta...

4677
02:22:26,310 --> 02:22:26,410
What?

4678
02:22:26,410 --> 02:22:27,870
I gotta finish this first.

4679
02:22:28,030 --> 02:22:29,270
But you want lasagna, though?

4680
02:22:29,270 --> 02:22:30,790
I don't deserve dinner until I finish this, alright?

4681
02:22:30,790 --> 02:22:31,970
Oh, that's so true, though.

4682
02:22:33,010 --> 02:22:34,050
Yeah, reward yourself.

4683
02:22:34,770 --> 02:22:34,930
Mm-hmm.

4684
02:22:34,950 --> 02:22:36,830
For a good job done.

4685
02:22:37,070 --> 02:22:37,450
Exactly.

4686
02:22:38,090 --> 02:22:38,890
Like, what did I do?

4687
02:22:39,070 --> 02:22:39,450
Nothing.

4688
02:22:40,110 --> 02:22:40,590
Exactly.

4689
02:22:41,770 --> 02:22:43,790
Did you draw, like, Michael?

4690
02:22:43,950 --> 02:22:45,390
Is that not a reward enough?

4691
02:22:46,630 --> 02:22:47,110
No.

4692
02:22:48,230 --> 02:22:49,550
But Prince is croaky?

4693
02:22:49,690 --> 02:22:49,990
Hell yeah.

4694
02:22:50,150 --> 02:22:51,090
Oh, true, true.

4695
02:22:55,550 --> 02:22:56,630
And then...

4696
02:22:59,670 --> 02:23:02,660
There's something wrong with your head, but I can't be bothered.

4697
02:23:02,840 --> 02:23:04,080
In your life or the trying?

4698
02:23:04,420 --> 02:23:05,500
The trying, right?

4699
02:23:06,500 --> 02:23:07,040
Sure.

4700
02:23:07,900 --> 02:23:08,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4701
02:23:08,960 --> 02:23:11,100
Don't worry, I can fix this in post.

4702
02:23:11,240 --> 02:23:11,640
Okay.

4703
02:23:21,770 --> 02:23:23,550
Oh, I know what to do.

4704
02:23:30,480 --> 02:23:31,460
There you go.

4705
02:23:32,760 --> 02:23:33,840
It's cramping.

4706
02:23:34,540 --> 02:23:35,740
So much coloring.

4707
02:23:36,180 --> 02:23:37,060
So much art.

4708
02:23:38,460 --> 02:23:40,980
Princess Croaky hails from the Croaky Kingdom.

4709
02:23:42,680 --> 02:23:45,020
She's taking over several neighboring nations.

4710
02:23:45,580 --> 02:23:45,960
Ooh.

4711
02:23:46,700 --> 02:23:49,540
I like how you're, like, making a whole story behind it.

4712
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:51,800
No, there's a story here for sure.

4713
02:23:54,600 --> 02:23:55,140
Yeah.

4714
02:23:56,740 --> 02:23:58,540
And now I cannot do this.

4715
02:23:58,640 --> 02:23:59,160
People have tried to catch her.

4716
02:23:59,400 --> 02:24:02,700
But she just turns into a crow and flies away anyway, so there's no point.

4717
02:24:02,760 --> 02:24:03,420
Yeah, there's no point.

4718
02:24:03,740 --> 02:24:04,160
Just die.

4719
02:24:04,160 --> 02:24:04,440
No point.

4720
02:24:04,440 --> 02:24:04,860
Yeah.

4721
02:24:05,060 --> 02:24:05,420
Mm-hmm.

4722
02:24:06,180 --> 02:24:07,040
Accept your fate.

4723
02:24:09,200 --> 02:24:10,400
Oh, I have a good idea.

4724
02:24:10,560 --> 02:24:12,100
I think I'm gonna give her a little bit of makeup here.

4725
02:24:13,620 --> 02:24:13,980
Makeup?

4726
02:24:14,140 --> 02:24:14,460
Whoa!

4727
02:24:14,840 --> 02:24:16,040
You're gonna give me eyeshadow?

4728
02:24:17,220 --> 02:24:18,360
I'm evil, you will.

4729
02:24:19,160 --> 02:24:20,100
You are evil.

4730
02:24:20,220 --> 02:24:21,240
No, you're not evil.

4731
02:24:21,360 --> 02:24:22,560
It's like mischievous, you know?

4732
02:24:22,860 --> 02:24:23,680
Oh, true, true, true.

4733
02:24:23,680 --> 02:24:26,040
I always like a bit of pink eyeshadow around it.

4734
02:24:26,640 --> 02:24:27,260
I just...

4735
02:24:27,260 --> 02:24:27,460
Yeah.

4736
02:24:29,940 --> 02:24:32,880
I think I'm gonna change the part too.

4737
02:24:33,080 --> 02:24:34,940
I mean, it's super messy, but it's okay.

4738
02:24:36,380 --> 02:24:38,860
There are no mistakes.

4739
02:24:40,560 --> 02:24:41,480
In art.

4740
02:24:42,160 --> 02:24:43,660
Only happy little accidents.

4741
02:24:43,980 --> 02:24:44,240
Exactly.

4742
02:24:48,780 --> 02:24:50,080
For a little...

4743
02:24:50,080 --> 02:24:51,360
Yeah, I'm gonna do too.

4744
02:24:52,840 --> 02:24:53,740
Actually, no.

4745
02:24:55,020 --> 02:24:56,300
Okay, my hands are too cramped.

4746
02:24:56,980 --> 02:24:58,320
Okay, I'm just gonna give her a little...

4747
02:24:58,320 --> 02:24:59,500
Yeah, like a little...

4748
02:25:00,280 --> 02:25:01,480
Crosshatch for no reason.

4749
02:25:01,860 --> 02:25:04,040
Because sometimes it just makes it look cool, you know?

4750
02:25:04,240 --> 02:25:04,540
Yeah.

4751
02:25:04,720 --> 02:25:05,780
It hides the little mistakes.

4752
02:25:06,380 --> 02:25:06,740
Yeah.

4753
02:25:07,040 --> 02:25:08,220
Like, it distracts everybody.

4754
02:25:10,260 --> 02:25:11,860
Yeah, I'm gonna cheat for this one.

4755
02:25:13,540 --> 02:25:14,540
I think I've heard that.

4756
02:25:14,720 --> 02:25:15,980
I think I've heard you say this.

4757
02:25:18,220 --> 02:25:19,540
I think I'm gonna cheat for this.

4758
02:25:20,020 --> 02:25:21,140
Yeah, I'm gonna cheat for this.

4759
02:25:21,200 --> 02:25:21,860
I hate her hair.

4760
02:25:23,800 --> 02:25:25,800
It'll make it look better, I swear to God.

4761
02:25:29,440 --> 02:25:34,440
Look, art is all about finding all these neat cool tricks that you can do to make things easier for yourself.

4762
02:25:34,960 --> 02:25:35,780
That is so true.

4763
02:25:35,960 --> 02:25:36,740
Shortcuts everywhere.

4764
02:25:37,420 --> 02:25:37,620
Yeah.

4765
02:25:38,460 --> 02:25:40,040
Literally, that's like how I...

4766
02:25:40,540 --> 02:25:41,700
How I survived.

4767
02:25:42,020 --> 02:25:43,860
How I survived in art.

4768
02:25:54,280 --> 02:25:54,760
And...

4769
02:25:54,760 --> 02:25:55,960
The croaky jewel.

4770
02:25:55,960 --> 02:25:56,020
Oh.

4771
02:26:01,670 --> 02:26:02,330
Alright.

4772
02:26:04,500 --> 02:26:05,010
Don't worry.

4773
02:26:05,450 --> 02:26:05,870
I can...

4774
02:26:05,870 --> 02:26:08,030
I've realized I forgot the most important part.

4775
02:26:08,270 --> 02:26:08,610
You're...

4776
02:26:08,610 --> 02:26:09,090
You're...

4777
02:26:09,090 --> 02:26:09,950
The flower.

4778
02:26:12,450 --> 02:26:14,010
I'll color that in later.

4779
02:26:15,530 --> 02:26:16,570
How's your...

4780
02:26:16,570 --> 02:26:16,610
Oh.

4781
02:26:17,460 --> 02:26:17,790
Right.

4782
02:26:21,150 --> 02:26:23,470
Don't worry, I'll just color that later, guys.

4783
02:26:23,470 --> 02:26:24,470
It's five.

4784
02:26:37,920 --> 02:26:39,200
Alright.

4785
02:26:46,390 --> 02:26:47,190
Yay.

4786
02:26:48,570 --> 02:26:49,650
You done?

4787
02:26:49,950 --> 02:26:50,510
No.

4788
02:26:52,510 --> 02:26:55,550
I'm just coloring your hair right now.

4789
02:26:59,620 --> 02:27:00,260
Yay.

4790
02:27:00,260 --> 02:27:00,760
Ehhh.

4791
02:27:09,760 --> 02:27:10,360
Hmm.

4792
02:27:17,180 --> 02:27:18,220
Are you done?

4793
02:27:19,180 --> 02:27:21,520
I'm just doing, like, details until you finish.

4794
02:27:21,840 --> 02:27:22,200
Okay.

4795
02:27:22,620 --> 02:27:23,400
But can I wait a second?

4796
02:27:23,400 --> 02:27:23,560
Sweet.

4797
02:27:25,420 --> 02:27:26,900
Cause I am definitely not done.

4798
02:27:27,380 --> 02:27:28,740
Do not worry.

4799
02:27:33,800 --> 02:27:34,280
Hmm.

4800
02:27:40,110 --> 02:27:40,490
Alright.

4801
02:27:40,830 --> 02:27:41,390
Let's do this.

4802
02:27:54,420 --> 02:27:55,020
Oh.

4803
02:27:55,300 --> 02:27:56,820
Like, the song that's playing right now.

4804
02:28:02,570 --> 02:28:03,170
What?

4805
02:28:04,090 --> 02:28:06,950
I have, like, a little playlist of, like, BGMs.

4806
02:28:06,950 --> 02:28:07,990
That's copyright free.

4807
02:28:09,170 --> 02:28:09,590
Oh.

4808
02:28:09,950 --> 02:28:12,090
I like the tune that's playing at the moment.

4809
02:28:13,990 --> 02:28:14,830
Your song?

4810
02:28:15,090 --> 02:28:15,570
Yeah.

4811
02:28:15,890 --> 02:28:16,990
It's on my stream.

4812
02:28:18,510 --> 02:28:19,110
Oh.

4813
02:28:19,170 --> 02:28:20,070
Speaking of...

4814
02:28:21,430 --> 02:28:22,030
What?

4815
02:28:22,530 --> 02:28:23,190
Oh, nothing.

4816
02:28:23,890 --> 02:28:24,730
Oh, yeah.

4817
02:28:24,730 --> 02:28:25,450
Oh, yeah.

4818
02:28:25,450 --> 02:28:26,850
Original song, guys.

4819
02:28:27,990 --> 02:28:28,550
How's it going?

4820
02:28:29,090 --> 02:28:29,750
How's it going?

4821
02:28:30,270 --> 02:28:31,130
Don't wash anything.

4822
02:28:31,350 --> 02:28:31,570
Don't worry.

4823
02:28:31,690 --> 02:28:32,290
Don't worry.

4824
02:28:32,410 --> 02:28:32,710
Don't worry.

4825
02:28:33,370 --> 02:28:34,390
I'm practicing it.

4826
02:28:34,810 --> 02:28:35,930
Okay, okay, okay.

4827
02:28:35,970 --> 02:28:36,850
Just so you know.

4828
02:28:37,110 --> 02:28:37,870
Just so you know.

4829
02:28:37,970 --> 02:28:39,030
Don't forget about it.

4830
02:28:39,030 --> 02:28:39,990
TJ and I will die.

4831
02:28:40,270 --> 02:28:40,630
Yeah, yeah.

4832
02:28:40,690 --> 02:28:43,170
Guys, guys, for those who don't know, who haven't watched the podcast yet.

4833
02:28:46,090 --> 02:28:46,490
Uh...

4834
02:28:46,490 --> 02:28:50,110
Lily and I have an original song that's in the works, right now.

4835
02:28:50,930 --> 02:28:52,970
Well, they're just waiting on me, but...

4836
02:28:55,690 --> 02:28:58,070
Just waiting on me, but it's in the works, guys.

4837
02:28:58,290 --> 02:28:59,510
It's in the works, guys.

4838
02:29:01,910 --> 02:29:02,830
It's beautiful.

4839
02:29:03,610 --> 02:29:05,790
I think she'll sound really pretty.

4840
02:29:07,510 --> 02:29:10,910
As soon as she records it, it's gonna be awesome.

4841
02:29:12,370 --> 02:29:13,150
Don't worry.

4842
02:29:13,430 --> 02:29:14,470
It will happen.

4843
02:29:15,630 --> 02:29:15,810
Yeah.

4844
02:29:17,670 --> 02:29:18,490
Don't worry.

4845
02:29:19,330 --> 02:29:20,410
Believe in them.

4846
02:29:20,630 --> 02:29:22,790
And me too, because it's all up to me.

4847
02:29:22,970 --> 02:29:26,890
To be fair, it's all up to me.

4848
02:29:31,290 --> 02:29:33,370
So, believe in me, actually.

4849
02:29:33,650 --> 02:29:34,370
I think that's better.

4850
02:29:34,710 --> 02:29:37,330
Believe in me to make sure we record it.

4851
02:29:38,950 --> 02:29:39,970
I believe.

4852
02:29:42,670 --> 02:29:43,910
I believe too.

4853
02:29:45,610 --> 02:29:46,830
Someone has to.

4854
02:29:46,830 --> 02:29:46,910
I believe too.

4855
02:29:54,770 --> 02:29:55,650
And then...

4856
02:29:56,850 --> 02:29:57,850
How did I do this?

4857
02:29:57,990 --> 02:29:58,050
What?

4858
02:29:58,210 --> 02:30:00,950
Okay, I'm gonna steal old Doki's skin color.

4859
02:30:03,390 --> 02:30:03,830
Alright.

4860
02:30:04,290 --> 02:30:05,350
Don't mind the feet, guys.

4861
02:30:05,510 --> 02:30:07,050
I just copy and pasting.

4862
02:30:07,050 --> 02:30:07,590
Alright.

4863
02:30:07,990 --> 02:30:08,110
Alright.

4864
02:30:09,730 --> 02:30:12,350
I'm stealing old Doki's color palette.

4865
02:30:14,980 --> 02:30:15,990
Wait, was it that?

4866
02:30:16,330 --> 02:30:17,290
Was it actually?

4867
02:30:21,820 --> 02:30:23,380
I've been...

4868
02:30:26,760 --> 02:30:28,360
I've had it once.

4869
02:30:28,580 --> 02:30:29,640
Oh, maybe it's...

4870
02:30:29,640 --> 02:30:30,780
This area.

4871
02:30:31,820 --> 02:30:32,680
Something lighter.

4872
02:30:32,680 --> 02:30:34,520
I need something here.

4873
02:30:40,950 --> 02:30:44,210
Yours is gonna be, like, super detailed, and then you'll see me...

4874
02:30:44,210 --> 02:30:45,550
No, no, no, no, no!

4875
02:30:56,300 --> 02:30:59,740
I can tell, though, that... it's been so long.

4876
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:04,420
You know, like, for me, when it's so long, my hands are not as stable as before.

4877
02:31:05,600 --> 02:31:08,320
When it comes to... You just gotta de-rust, you know?

4878
02:31:08,540 --> 02:31:08,580
Yeah.

4879
02:31:09,260 --> 02:31:12,440
But definitely I can tell my hands are not stable when it...

4880
02:31:12,440 --> 02:31:14,380
...comes to line art and stuff.

4881
02:31:15,680 --> 02:31:16,260
Cause I...

4882
02:31:16,260 --> 02:31:19,560
I was... I had, like, super...

4883
02:31:19,560 --> 02:31:21,520
...super smooth line art back then.

4884
02:31:22,540 --> 02:31:23,480
Oh my god.

4885
02:31:23,760 --> 02:31:25,440
It was only five years, man!

4886
02:31:25,540 --> 02:31:26,180
You can do it!

4887
02:31:26,440 --> 02:31:28,460
Oh, that's a long time!

4888
02:31:29,780 --> 02:31:32,180
Five years on the internet is a very long time.

4889
02:31:41,920 --> 02:31:44,140
A lot can change in five years.

4890
02:31:44,140 --> 02:31:44,180
A lot can change in five years.

4891
02:31:58,530 --> 02:31:58,930
No.

4892
02:32:07,210 --> 02:32:08,030
I don't know.

4893
02:32:17,290 --> 02:32:20,810
Thank you, Pastoki, for letting me steal my own color palette.

4894
02:32:21,490 --> 02:32:23,150
I really appreciate it.

4895
02:32:35,430 --> 02:32:36,310
Super pretty, though.

4896
02:32:36,470 --> 02:32:36,690
Okay.

4897
02:32:37,970 --> 02:32:38,770
I am...

4898
02:32:38,770 --> 02:32:39,730
...done, I think.

4899
02:32:39,850 --> 02:32:39,990
Are you done?

4900
02:32:40,450 --> 02:32:40,950
Oh, shit.

4901
02:32:40,950 --> 02:32:41,750
Yeah, but you can take your time.

4902
02:32:41,850 --> 02:32:42,430
Don't worry about it.

4903
02:32:42,430 --> 02:32:43,130
Okay, cool.

4904
02:32:44,270 --> 02:32:45,790
Cause I just have your...

4905
02:32:45,790 --> 02:32:47,610
...flower and your dress left.

4906
02:32:48,390 --> 02:32:49,710
And then I'm not gonna...

4907
02:32:49,710 --> 02:32:50,790
...try on the other parts.

4908
02:32:51,010 --> 02:32:52,510
Actually, I'm not even gonna try on your dress.

4909
02:32:53,050 --> 02:32:53,370
Let me...

4910
02:32:55,950 --> 02:32:57,070
Don't worry about it, man.

4911
02:32:57,070 --> 02:32:57,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4912
02:32:57,890 --> 02:32:58,690
If you're done...

4913
02:32:58,690 --> 02:33:00,510
If you're done, it's time...

4914
02:33:00,510 --> 02:33:01,430
...to speed run it.

4915
02:33:03,030 --> 02:33:04,690
Oh, I'm just... I'm just chillin'.

4916
02:33:04,690 --> 02:33:05,250
Do not worry.

4917
02:33:34,990 --> 02:33:35,130
I'm gonna order lasagna after.

4918
02:33:35,150 --> 02:33:35,210
Oh my god.

4919
02:33:35,210 --> 02:33:35,970
A good stream, you know?

4920
02:33:36,130 --> 02:33:36,970
A good stream?

4921
02:33:37,370 --> 02:33:39,990
A good stream with some good ideas.

4922
02:33:40,390 --> 02:33:42,030
You do drive a hard bargain, yeah.

4923
02:33:42,270 --> 02:33:42,690
Exactly.

4924
02:33:43,770 --> 02:33:45,250
Should I get breadsticks too?

4925
02:33:45,250 --> 02:33:45,670
You should.

4926
02:33:45,930 --> 02:33:47,110
Oh my god, mozzarella breadsticks.

4927
02:33:47,570 --> 02:33:48,250
Oh god, okay.

4928
02:33:49,010 --> 02:33:52,350
But just to like, even it out, should I get like a Caesar salad or something?

4929
02:33:53,170 --> 02:33:57,750
Okay, but like, I don't know if it's gonna be good Caesar salad, no, that's the thing.

4930
02:33:59,650 --> 02:34:02,490
It might not be really good Caesar salad, so I don't know.

4931
02:34:02,490 --> 02:34:02,570
Yeah.

4932
02:34:03,790 --> 02:34:05,990
But I agree on the breadsticks, though.

4933
02:34:10,770 --> 02:34:13,090
I think breadsticks is a very good idea.

4934
02:34:13,350 --> 02:34:14,110
Good job, Doki.

4935
02:34:14,590 --> 02:34:16,990
I like bread when it's like, slightly chewy.

4936
02:34:17,330 --> 02:34:18,270
I don't know how to board it.

4937
02:34:18,430 --> 02:34:19,610
Oh, that's so true.

4938
02:34:25,680 --> 02:34:26,640
There it is.

4939
02:34:50,710 --> 02:34:51,230
Alright.

4940
02:34:51,750 --> 02:34:53,290
Wait, what's the bottom half look like?

4941
02:34:54,270 --> 02:34:58,010
It really is, like... I never really fully...

4942
02:34:58,270 --> 02:34:59,530
Like, what color is it?

4943
02:35:00,390 --> 02:35:01,290
Finished it?

4944
02:35:01,430 --> 02:35:01,710
Yeah.

4945
02:35:02,390 --> 02:35:02,870
So...

4946
02:35:02,870 --> 02:35:04,290
I don't got a body.

4947
02:35:05,230 --> 02:35:06,230
Like, my bad.

4948
02:35:06,230 --> 02:35:06,870
Are you wearing...

4949
02:35:07,250 --> 02:35:09,530
Okay, I'm gonna give it black pants, then.

4950
02:35:10,750 --> 02:35:13,110
I'm like, what color is the bottom, though?

4951
02:35:16,750 --> 02:35:17,470
That's fine.

4952
02:35:17,470 --> 02:35:17,510
That's fine.

4953
02:35:40,070 --> 02:35:40,630
Alright.

4954
02:35:43,730 --> 02:35:44,850
And then...

4955
02:35:47,670 --> 02:35:50,210
I've definitely sobered up, though, while we're doing this.

4956
02:35:52,790 --> 02:35:54,570
I think I'm sobered up, too.

4957
02:35:54,890 --> 02:35:55,970
I'm not just hungry.

4958
02:35:57,130 --> 02:35:58,870
I definitely feel...

4959
02:35:58,870 --> 02:36:00,150
I feel very sober.

4960
02:36:00,470 --> 02:36:03,270
Well, not very sober, but, like, I'm definitely...

4961
02:36:04,010 --> 02:36:07,130
I can't believe an hour ago we were talking about horse...

4962
02:36:07,130 --> 02:36:08,610
Horses, and...

4963
02:36:08,610 --> 02:36:09,430
Dude, I remember...

4964
02:36:09,430 --> 02:36:11,290
I had so much conversation about...

4965
02:36:11,290 --> 02:36:12,050
Horses team.

4966
02:36:13,270 --> 02:36:15,290
We got IPM horses.

4967
02:36:15,290 --> 02:36:15,850
We...

4968
02:36:15,850 --> 02:36:16,250
We...

4969
02:36:16,250 --> 02:36:19,670
I can't believe...

4970
02:36:19,670 --> 02:36:20,250
I can't...

4971
02:36:20,250 --> 02:36:21,350
That's not what happens.

4972
02:36:21,590 --> 02:36:21,730
That was a long...

4973
02:36:21,730 --> 02:36:23,010
The conversation was too long.

4974
02:36:23,090 --> 02:36:23,550
Oh, my God.

4975
02:36:23,630 --> 02:36:25,050
And I Google image your feet.

4976
02:36:25,250 --> 02:36:25,850
Oh, my God.

4977
02:36:26,030 --> 02:36:26,310
You did.

4978
02:36:26,890 --> 02:36:26,970
Bad.

4979
02:36:27,190 --> 02:36:27,370
Bad.

4980
02:36:27,370 --> 02:36:27,830
That's bad.

4981
02:36:28,550 --> 02:36:30,010
And then we talked about wiki feet.

4982
02:36:30,010 --> 02:36:32,010
Not that your feet are bad, but just...

4983
02:36:33,630 --> 02:36:34,490
How was it?

4984
02:36:34,530 --> 02:36:35,290
How was the feet?

4985
02:36:37,090 --> 02:36:37,930
It was...

4986
02:36:38,350 --> 02:36:38,770
Delectable.

4987
02:36:39,290 --> 02:36:40,130
Is that the word?

4988
02:36:40,290 --> 02:36:41,030
Is that...

4989
02:36:41,030 --> 02:36:43,150
Is that the word you want to stick with?

4990
02:36:43,750 --> 02:36:44,170
Uh...

4991
02:36:44,590 --> 02:36:45,010
Succulent?

4992
02:36:45,010 --> 02:36:45,570
I don't know.

4993
02:36:45,570 --> 02:36:46,590
Excuse me?

4994
02:36:49,530 --> 02:36:50,010
Nice.

4995
02:36:50,630 --> 02:36:52,330
Are you sure you're sober?

4996
02:36:53,350 --> 02:36:53,830
I'm...

4997
02:36:53,830 --> 02:36:55,290
You got good grippers.

4998
02:36:58,210 --> 02:37:01,770
I have a feeling you are maybe not that sober as you think you are.

4999
02:37:02,130 --> 02:37:02,490
I am.

5000
02:37:02,790 --> 02:37:03,950
I'm very sober.

5001
02:37:04,190 --> 02:37:04,370
I...

5002
02:37:04,370 --> 02:37:06,390
I do appreciate feet though, you know?

5003
02:37:06,610 --> 02:37:06,970
Like...

5004
02:37:06,970 --> 02:37:07,210
Wait, really?

5005
02:37:07,890 --> 02:37:08,890
Like, Jury's feet.

5006
02:37:09,090 --> 02:37:10,150
Have you seen Jury's feet?

5007
02:37:10,370 --> 02:37:10,970
Wait, what?

5008
02:37:11,110 --> 02:37:11,690
Who's Jury?

5009
02:37:12,310 --> 02:37:13,410
Jury from Street Fighter.

5010
02:37:13,690 --> 02:37:13,930
Oh, Jury!

5011
02:37:13,930 --> 02:37:14,970
I was like...

5012
02:37:15,290 --> 02:37:15,470
Jury!

5013
02:37:15,830 --> 02:37:16,350
Jury!

5014
02:37:17,190 --> 02:37:17,710
Jury!

5015
02:37:19,130 --> 02:37:19,650
Oh...

5016
02:37:19,650 --> 02:37:21,330
Yeah, I know what...

5017
02:37:21,330 --> 02:37:22,890
I know who you're talking about.

5018
02:37:23,470 --> 02:37:23,730
Yeah.

5019
02:37:24,470 --> 02:37:25,270
So you understand.

5020
02:37:25,690 --> 02:37:27,370
I don't, but like I know who you're talking about.

5021
02:37:27,910 --> 02:37:29,930
I know who you're talking about.

5022
02:37:29,950 --> 02:37:31,510
I thought we were on the same page, my bad.

5023
02:37:32,130 --> 02:37:33,710
No, we were definitely...

5024
02:37:33,710 --> 02:37:35,450
As a person who is...

5025
02:37:35,450 --> 02:37:36,150
Who does not...

5026
02:37:36,150 --> 02:37:38,790
Who does not enjoy feet...

5027
02:37:38,790 --> 02:37:39,490
I...

5028
02:37:39,490 --> 02:37:39,890
I...

5029
02:37:39,890 --> 02:37:40,670
I think you lie.

5030
02:37:41,330 --> 02:37:41,790
Sure.

5031
02:37:42,310 --> 02:37:42,850
Sure, sure.

5032
02:37:42,970 --> 02:37:44,270
But like, you know...

5033
02:37:44,270 --> 02:37:45,630
I do not kink shame.

5034
02:37:48,990 --> 02:37:49,570
Yeah?

5035
02:37:49,830 --> 02:37:50,330
Are you okay?

5036
02:37:50,750 --> 02:37:51,570
Are you...

5037
02:37:51,570 --> 02:37:52,170
Are you okay?

5038
02:37:53,150 --> 02:37:56,110
Every time I sniff, I put my V2 model behind you?

5039
02:37:58,750 --> 02:37:59,630
Not the feet?

5040
02:37:59,790 --> 02:38:00,970
You can like pull my...

5041
02:38:00,970 --> 02:38:03,430
My skin suit up a little bit and...

5042
02:38:03,430 --> 02:38:03,610
Oh!

5043
02:38:03,810 --> 02:38:04,610
You have feet?

5044
02:38:05,170 --> 02:38:05,590
Damn!

5045
02:38:07,610 --> 02:38:08,650
Are you doing that now?

5046
02:38:08,650 --> 02:38:09,830
She has a whole fucking...

5047
02:38:09,830 --> 02:38:11,170
She has a whole freaking outfit.

5048
02:38:11,810 --> 02:38:12,450
Wow, that guy...

5049
02:38:12,450 --> 02:38:13,650
I can't even show myself.

5050
02:38:13,870 --> 02:38:15,170
Look, I like end right there.

5051
02:38:15,510 --> 02:38:15,930
Yeah.

5052
02:38:21,970 --> 02:38:22,810
I float.

5053
02:38:23,790 --> 02:38:24,290
Whoa.

5054
02:38:26,910 --> 02:38:28,150
How do I do glasses?

5055
02:38:29,070 --> 02:38:29,570
Don't...

5056
02:38:30,670 --> 02:38:32,430
You're not wearing glasses anymore.

5057
02:38:34,490 --> 02:38:35,330
And then...

5058
02:38:35,330 --> 02:38:36,410
You don't figure out like this.

5059
02:38:36,970 --> 02:38:38,070
I'll give you tiny glasses.

5060
02:38:43,520 --> 02:38:43,880
Okay.

5061
02:38:43,920 --> 02:38:45,200
You're not wearing glasses anymore.

5062
02:38:45,400 --> 02:38:46,240
I can't be bothered.

5063
02:38:46,520 --> 02:38:47,100
Alright, I'm done.

5064
02:38:54,960 --> 02:38:55,320
Alright.

5065
02:38:56,580 --> 02:38:57,680
Ready, ready, ready, ready.

5066
02:38:57,820 --> 02:38:58,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5067
02:38:58,340 --> 02:38:58,680
I'm done.

5068
02:38:59,700 --> 02:39:00,060
Yeah.

5069
02:39:02,680 --> 02:39:04,380
You're not wearing glasses, though.

5070
02:39:05,200 --> 02:39:05,960
I'm not wearing glasses?

5071
02:39:06,360 --> 02:39:07,300
Yeah, unfortunately.

5072
02:39:07,600 --> 02:39:07,720
Do not worry.

5073
02:39:07,880 --> 02:39:09,000
I think I have a thing with glasses.

5074
02:39:09,020 --> 02:39:09,680
There we go.

5075
02:39:09,920 --> 02:39:10,440
Actually, no.

5076
02:39:10,600 --> 02:39:11,700
I can do something for it.

5077
02:39:12,480 --> 02:39:13,640
Glasses, PNG.

5078
02:39:16,460 --> 02:39:17,140
Don't worry.

5079
02:39:17,920 --> 02:39:26,580
I can't... That's where I draw the line.

5080
02:39:27,060 --> 02:39:29,720
That's where I get... That's where I've given up.

5081
02:39:30,060 --> 02:39:32,720
Okay, circle, circle, glass.

5082
02:39:33,060 --> 02:39:34,120
Circle glasses.

5083
02:39:37,160 --> 02:39:38,540
Wait, I'm almost done.

5084
02:39:38,740 --> 02:39:40,820
I just need to do circle glasses.

5085
02:39:44,940 --> 02:39:45,440
Transparent.

5086
02:39:46,220 --> 02:39:46,980
Oh, there you go.

5087
02:39:47,100 --> 02:39:47,720
Oh, this is nice.

5088
02:39:48,080 --> 02:39:48,640
Those are cute.

5089
02:39:54,200 --> 02:39:55,120
Ready to show?

5090
02:39:55,580 --> 02:39:57,480
Um, let me give you glasses first.

5091
02:39:58,120 --> 02:40:00,260
Let me give you glasses.

5092
02:40:01,420 --> 02:40:03,100
And then I'll be ready to show.

5093
02:40:05,140 --> 02:40:05,800
Okay, wait.

5094
02:40:09,160 --> 02:40:11,060
I need to pull it up in my files.

5095
02:40:12,260 --> 02:40:13,580
Pull up in my file.

5096
02:40:14,360 --> 02:40:16,220
I love this collaboration thing.

5097
02:40:16,300 --> 02:40:17,620
It makes me want to do more VTuber collabs.

5098
02:40:17,720 --> 02:40:18,460
It's so freaking cute.

5099
02:40:18,580 --> 02:40:19,120
Oh, my God.

5100
02:40:19,400 --> 02:40:21,680
It's so, like, convenient, too, right?

5101
02:40:21,800 --> 02:40:22,500
I can go to your right.

5102
02:40:22,660 --> 02:40:23,300
I can go to your left.

5103
02:40:23,300 --> 02:40:24,180
I can go to your right.

5104
02:40:24,300 --> 02:40:24,920
That's so cool.

5105
02:40:26,200 --> 02:40:28,920
I believe... Oh, but you haven't done a lot of VTuber collabs, right?

5106
02:40:28,920 --> 02:40:30,320
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm.

5107
02:40:30,340 --> 02:40:31,280
Oh, yeah, so it's, like, museum.

5108
02:40:31,280 --> 02:40:31,740
This is really cool, though.

5109
02:40:31,800 --> 02:40:32,420
I love it.

5110
02:40:33,520 --> 02:40:36,020
Why can't I save this as a .jpeg?

5111
02:40:36,040 --> 02:40:36,380
Oh, there you go.

5112
02:40:36,740 --> 02:40:37,140
.jpeg.

5113
02:40:37,560 --> 02:40:39,460
I had to save it as a .jpeg.

5114
02:40:40,320 --> 02:40:41,700
Can I make myself huge?

5115
02:40:41,920 --> 02:40:42,600
Oh, my God.

5116
02:40:42,720 --> 02:40:43,760
That's creaky.

5117
02:40:44,720 --> 02:40:45,120
All right.

5118
02:40:48,060 --> 02:40:49,240
Oh, it wasn't transparent.

5119
02:40:50,220 --> 02:40:50,900
That's fine.

5120
02:40:55,060 --> 02:40:56,020
Let's do this.

5121
02:40:56,180 --> 02:40:56,300
Oh.

5122
02:40:57,500 --> 02:40:57,840
Big.

5123
02:40:58,880 --> 02:41:00,100
I'm like a titan.

5124
02:41:01,240 --> 02:41:02,640
What are you doing?

5125
02:41:08,800 --> 02:41:09,620
So cool.

5126
02:41:09,920 --> 02:41:09,960
Oh, my God.

5127
02:41:10,440 --> 02:41:10,900
Never mind.

5128
02:41:11,280 --> 02:41:12,840
Why didn't they give me a PNG?

5129
02:41:14,560 --> 02:41:17,460
Sorry, I'm, like, suffering here because I'm trying to find the perfect...

5130
02:41:17,460 --> 02:41:20,920
I'm trying to find the perfect PNG glasses for you.

5131
02:41:21,120 --> 02:41:22,300
Oh, okay.

5132
02:41:22,640 --> 02:41:23,300
Oh, I found a good one.

5133
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:24,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5134
02:41:25,320 --> 02:41:25,560
Wait.

5135
02:41:25,860 --> 02:41:26,940
Oh, I have to pay for this?

5136
02:41:27,900 --> 02:41:28,720
Don't pay for it.

5137
02:41:28,920 --> 02:41:30,160
Just draw the circle, man.

5138
02:41:30,460 --> 02:41:31,260
No, no!

5139
02:41:31,920 --> 02:41:32,720
You can do it.

5140
02:41:32,800 --> 02:41:33,820
I know you can do it.

5141
02:41:34,040 --> 02:41:34,700
I can't.

5142
02:41:34,820 --> 02:41:35,220
I'm not.

5143
02:41:35,320 --> 02:41:35,840
Just draw the circle.

5144
02:41:35,840 --> 02:41:37,280
I'm not strong enough.

5145
02:41:37,760 --> 02:41:38,920
You can do it.

5146
02:41:39,060 --> 02:41:39,360
No.

5147
02:41:39,860 --> 02:41:40,740
I can't.

5148
02:41:40,780 --> 02:41:41,500
I'm sorry.

5149
02:41:42,800 --> 02:41:43,680
I'm sorry.

5150
02:41:43,900 --> 02:41:44,320
I'm not.

5151
02:41:44,480 --> 02:41:45,240
I can't.

5152
02:41:45,760 --> 02:41:47,020
It's just two circles.

5153
02:41:47,020 --> 02:41:48,860
Yeah, it's just too much.

5154
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:50,220
It's too much work.

5155
02:41:50,680 --> 02:41:51,040
Is it?

5156
02:41:52,140 --> 02:41:53,000
Really not?

5157
02:41:53,620 --> 02:41:54,940
Yes, you don't understand.

5158
02:41:54,960 --> 02:41:56,140
It doesn't have to be perfect.

5159
02:41:56,680 --> 02:41:58,240
It does, though.

5160
02:41:58,420 --> 02:41:59,200
No, it doesn't.

5161
02:41:59,240 --> 02:42:00,220
Yes, it does.

5162
02:42:00,500 --> 02:42:01,780
If it's not perfect.

5163
02:42:02,060 --> 02:42:03,220
Okay, I found it.

5164
02:42:03,680 --> 02:42:06,560
Web P to PNG.

5165
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:08,100
I just need to convert it.

5166
02:42:11,500 --> 02:42:13,160
And then, and then, every...

5167
02:42:13,160 --> 02:42:13,820
No, you don't understand.

5168
02:42:14,020 --> 02:42:14,840
I swear to God.

5169
02:42:14,840 --> 02:42:15,860
It would be like...

5170
02:42:15,860 --> 02:42:17,160
It would be so worth it.

5171
02:42:17,280 --> 02:42:17,940
I swear to God.

5172
02:42:18,820 --> 02:42:19,600
I believe you.

5173
02:42:20,220 --> 02:42:22,960
It's not like the croaky thing where it wasn't worth the wait.

5174
02:42:23,180 --> 02:42:23,800
But like...

5175
02:42:24,440 --> 02:42:25,600
Yeah, that was funny.

5176
02:42:26,100 --> 02:42:26,860
Good times.

5177
02:42:27,440 --> 02:42:28,440
Good times.

5178
02:42:28,920 --> 02:42:29,300
Yeah, yeah.

5179
02:42:29,880 --> 02:42:30,220
Exactly.

5180
02:42:30,700 --> 02:42:31,140
Princess croaky.

5181
02:42:32,580 --> 02:42:32,940
Okay.

5182
02:42:33,760 --> 02:42:34,320
Save.

5183
02:42:35,740 --> 02:42:36,460
Did it save?

5184
02:42:36,700 --> 02:42:37,440
It did.

5185
02:42:38,660 --> 02:42:39,220
Yippee.

5186
02:42:40,220 --> 02:42:41,120
Okay, guys.

5187
02:42:41,720 --> 02:42:42,580
We got glasses.

5188
02:42:43,580 --> 02:42:44,020
All right.

5189
02:42:44,820 --> 02:42:46,560
We actually got glasses now.

5190
02:42:48,580 --> 02:42:49,660
It's Ray-Bans.

5191
02:42:49,880 --> 02:42:50,340
Oh my God.

5192
02:42:50,400 --> 02:42:50,980
That's even better.

5193
02:42:53,760 --> 02:42:55,440
You gave me Ray-Bans?

5194
02:42:55,700 --> 02:42:57,360
Yeah, I gave you Ray-Bans.

5195
02:42:57,880 --> 02:42:58,420
Thank you.

5196
02:42:58,800 --> 02:42:59,760
Thank you, Toki.

5197
02:43:05,360 --> 02:43:07,840
Okay, maybe I should have just drawn circles.

5198
02:43:08,020 --> 02:43:08,760
But like...

5199
02:43:11,380 --> 02:43:12,460
But it's too late.

5200
02:43:13,780 --> 02:43:14,680
It's too late.

5201
02:43:15,740 --> 02:43:16,840
It still works.

5202
02:43:19,860 --> 02:43:21,800
I took off my glasses, though.

5203
02:43:21,940 --> 02:43:22,740
So I didn't know if you...

5204
02:43:22,740 --> 02:43:23,780
Okay, I'm gonna put them back on.

5205
02:43:23,780 --> 02:43:24,980
It's like...

5206
02:43:24,980 --> 02:43:26,160
It's not that noticeable.

5207
02:43:26,620 --> 02:43:27,720
But like...

5208
02:43:27,720 --> 02:43:28,620
But like...

5209
02:43:28,620 --> 02:43:29,360
You have glasses.

5210
02:43:30,320 --> 02:43:30,680
Okay.

5211
02:43:32,340 --> 02:43:32,940
Oopsie.

5212
02:43:33,040 --> 02:43:33,380
Oh my God.

5213
02:43:33,560 --> 02:43:34,360
Oopsie, oopsie.

5214
02:43:34,480 --> 02:43:34,600
Okay.

5215
02:43:35,060 --> 02:43:35,660
Okay.

5216
02:43:35,840 --> 02:43:36,440
Okay.

5217
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:37,240
Okay.

5218
02:43:37,240 --> 02:43:39,440
I'll show you that you're not glasses one.

5219
02:43:39,660 --> 02:43:40,880
And then you're glasses one.

5220
02:43:42,160 --> 02:43:42,600
All right.

5221
02:43:43,340 --> 02:43:44,620
This is you with glasses.

5222
02:43:46,340 --> 02:43:48,020
This is you without glasses.

5223
02:43:49,400 --> 02:43:50,620
Did you send anything?

5224
02:43:50,920 --> 02:43:51,200
No.

5225
02:43:55,940 --> 02:43:57,560
Did you send me a pencil?

5226
02:43:57,960 --> 02:43:58,060
Okay.

5227
02:43:58,320 --> 02:43:59,780
Now I sent it.

5228
02:44:00,100 --> 02:44:01,060
Oh my God.

5229
02:44:01,100 --> 02:44:02,780
This is so cute, Toki.

5230
02:44:04,480 --> 02:44:05,720
You like your Ray-Bans?

5231
02:44:06,080 --> 02:44:07,240
I love them.

5232
02:44:07,440 --> 02:44:07,820
Hold on.

5233
02:44:07,920 --> 02:44:08,960
I'm gonna show my chat.

5234
02:44:09,120 --> 02:44:11,280
Oh, I'll show you the glasses I gave you.

5235
02:44:11,960 --> 02:44:12,700
So cute.

5236
02:44:13,040 --> 02:44:13,480
How cute.

5237
02:44:14,380 --> 02:44:15,320
Look at your Ray-Bans.

5238
02:44:15,340 --> 02:44:16,440
It's like a little me character.

5239
02:44:16,480 --> 02:44:17,360
I love it.

5240
02:44:19,700 --> 02:44:21,960
Guys, I'll show you the Ray-Bans chat.

5241
02:44:22,060 --> 02:44:22,420
Don't worry.

5242
02:44:24,700 --> 02:44:26,060
It's so cute.

5243
02:44:27,560 --> 02:44:29,380
I gave her these glasses.

5244
02:44:30,520 --> 02:44:32,520
I look by a little figurine of this.

5245
02:44:33,500 --> 02:44:34,280
So cute.

5246
02:44:35,560 --> 02:44:36,220
All right.

5247
02:44:36,440 --> 02:44:37,020
Your turn.

5248
02:44:37,560 --> 02:44:38,360
Thank you.

5249
02:44:38,520 --> 02:44:41,060
I think I accidentally flipped it.

5250
02:44:42,020 --> 02:44:42,720
There you go.

5251
02:44:42,980 --> 02:44:43,640
I'll get rid of it.

5252
02:44:43,780 --> 02:44:46,000
I'll give Ray-Bans to the real Lily, too.

5253
02:44:47,180 --> 02:44:48,080
Oh, how do I flip it?

5254
02:44:48,120 --> 02:44:48,800
How do I flip it?

5255
02:44:49,020 --> 02:44:49,140
Oh!

5256
02:44:50,060 --> 02:44:50,660
Wait, what happened?

5257
02:44:51,560 --> 02:44:52,940
I'm just learning how to flip.

5258
02:44:53,080 --> 02:44:53,900
Because I flipped it.

5259
02:44:54,040 --> 02:44:55,380
So it was like flipped already.

5260
02:44:55,740 --> 02:44:55,880
You know?

5261
02:44:56,160 --> 02:44:56,320
Oh!

5262
02:44:56,780 --> 02:44:57,800
Yeah, I messed up.

5263
02:44:58,520 --> 02:44:59,780
So I have to flip it again.

5264
02:45:00,640 --> 02:45:01,040
Oh!

5265
02:45:01,600 --> 02:45:02,820
Wait, that's so cute, too!

5266
02:45:03,680 --> 02:45:04,480
Princess Kroki.

5267
02:45:04,660 --> 02:45:05,680
Princess Kroki.

5268
02:45:06,140 --> 02:45:08,060
You know, when you're talking about like burning stuff.

5269
02:45:08,140 --> 02:45:11,320
I thought you were actually like drawing like a burning building and stuff behind me.

5270
02:45:12,320 --> 02:45:13,700
Oh, no, no, no, no.

5271
02:45:13,760 --> 02:45:14,600
But I can imagine it.

5272
02:45:14,660 --> 02:45:16,420
I can imagine her burning buildings.

5273
02:45:17,120 --> 02:45:17,800
You would.

5274
02:45:17,900 --> 02:45:19,740
You would burn down the neighboring nations.

5275
02:45:20,100 --> 02:45:21,980
And they would ask her to keep the tree or something.

5276
02:45:22,140 --> 02:45:23,380
Yeah, I would commit more crimes.

5277
02:45:23,380 --> 02:45:23,560
And you would burn down the tree.

5278
02:45:24,220 --> 02:45:25,120
Oh, no, no.

5279
02:45:25,200 --> 02:45:25,600
Fuck trees.

5280
02:45:25,720 --> 02:45:26,680
No, I actually hate trees.

5281
02:45:27,160 --> 02:45:27,560
Oh.

5282
02:45:27,800 --> 02:45:28,280
Oh, yeah.

5283
02:45:28,480 --> 02:45:29,640
Then you'd burn down everything.

5284
02:45:30,960 --> 02:45:31,540
Look at that.

5285
02:45:31,680 --> 02:45:32,540
Princess Kroki.

5286
02:45:33,160 --> 02:45:34,460
Guys, I don't actually...

5287
02:45:34,460 --> 02:45:36,060
Okay, I don't actually hate trees.

5288
02:45:36,280 --> 02:45:38,520
But I hate tree-adjacent characters.

5289
02:45:38,900 --> 02:45:40,420
Oh, so I said treaties?

5290
02:45:40,420 --> 02:45:40,760
Treaties?

5291
02:45:41,040 --> 02:45:41,480
Yeah.

5292
02:45:44,200 --> 02:45:46,620
Wait, did you mean treaties or trees?

5293
02:45:48,880 --> 02:45:50,200
Wait, you...

5294
02:45:50,200 --> 02:45:53,080
I don't understand anymore.

5295
02:45:55,560 --> 02:45:57,140
She hates trees?

5296
02:45:58,340 --> 02:46:00,060
We'll never know.

5297
02:46:00,860 --> 02:46:02,360
We'll never know.

5298
02:46:02,900 --> 02:46:03,660
It's so cute.

5299
02:46:04,400 --> 02:46:05,440
That's really cute.

5300
02:46:05,640 --> 02:46:06,360
I love this.

5301
02:46:06,880 --> 02:46:08,640
I love your suit.

5302
02:46:09,080 --> 02:46:09,380
Yeah.

5303
02:46:10,640 --> 02:46:12,340
Alright, it's like...

5304
02:46:12,340 --> 02:46:14,440
I was thinking about Animal Crossing and Mii's.

5305
02:46:14,980 --> 02:46:16,100
Yeah, it reminds me of it.

5306
02:46:16,520 --> 02:46:18,780
The glasses give it like a secretary look.

5307
02:46:19,100 --> 02:46:20,080
Oh, that's true.

5308
02:46:20,260 --> 02:46:21,200
You're like Isabelle.

5309
02:46:21,960 --> 02:46:22,780
Princess Kroki.

5310
02:46:23,260 --> 02:46:24,140
Yeah, Princess Kroki.

5311
02:46:24,140 --> 02:46:24,880
Do we proceed?

5312
02:46:25,220 --> 02:46:26,280
No, I'm the secretary.

5313
02:46:26,480 --> 02:46:27,260
You're the princess Kroki.

5314
02:46:27,280 --> 02:46:27,320
Yeah.

5315
02:46:27,440 --> 02:46:27,980
And I'm like...

5316
02:46:27,980 --> 02:46:29,280
And I ask you like...

5317
02:46:29,280 --> 02:46:32,080
Are you sure you want to burn down our neighboring countries?

5318
02:46:32,420 --> 02:46:33,220
And I'll be like...

5319
02:46:33,220 --> 02:46:34,380
Why are you asking me?

5320
02:46:34,380 --> 02:46:36,080
Why are you asking me?

5321
02:46:36,320 --> 02:46:36,400
I'm so sorry.

5322
02:46:36,400 --> 02:46:37,180
Why are you hesitating?

5323
02:46:37,780 --> 02:46:38,160
I'm sorry.

5324
02:46:38,160 --> 02:46:38,940
You still feel for them?

5325
02:46:42,340 --> 02:46:44,360
Do you not care about our nation?

5326
02:46:45,160 --> 02:46:45,700
I do.

5327
02:46:45,920 --> 02:46:46,360
You're right.

5328
02:46:46,860 --> 02:46:47,540
Of course.

5329
02:46:47,720 --> 02:46:49,580
Please don't hurt my dogs.

5330
02:46:51,600 --> 02:46:53,180
Please don't beat up Michael.

5331
02:46:55,500 --> 02:46:57,200
Like Michael is in the dungeon.

5332
02:46:57,600 --> 02:46:59,300
And like bring him out of the dungeon.

5333
02:46:59,580 --> 02:46:59,920
And I was like...

5334
02:46:59,920 --> 02:47:01,300
Do you have a voodoo doll?

5335
02:47:01,720 --> 02:47:02,960
And I was like...

5336
02:47:02,960 --> 02:47:08,520
Lily here tells me that she is hesitant about burning the neighboring countries.

5337
02:47:09,200 --> 02:47:10,240
Yeah, I'll be like...

5338
02:47:10,240 --> 02:47:10,740
Stop.

5339
02:47:13,800 --> 02:47:15,280
I'll be like...

5340
02:47:15,280 --> 02:47:16,920
You want to hesitate again, Lily?

5341
02:47:17,360 --> 02:47:18,680
No, I am so sorry.

5342
02:47:18,780 --> 02:47:20,560
I will go ahead and press the button.

5343
02:47:20,920 --> 02:47:21,620
That's right.

5344
02:47:21,620 --> 02:47:23,360
Or you'll have to beat up Michael.

5345
02:47:26,320 --> 02:47:27,980
Then I'll have to stage a coup.

5346
02:47:28,940 --> 02:47:29,840
You're going to stage a coup?

5347
02:47:30,040 --> 02:47:30,140
Oh, it's called?

5348
02:47:30,620 --> 02:47:31,280
Yeah, a coup.

5349
02:47:31,500 --> 02:47:31,740
Yeah, yeah.

5350
02:47:31,880 --> 02:47:32,840
To like an uprising.

5351
02:47:33,520 --> 02:47:34,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5352
02:47:34,460 --> 02:47:34,900
Like viva...

5353
02:47:34,900 --> 02:47:35,300
I want to do it.

5354
02:47:35,560 --> 02:47:36,340
Like viva la fra...

5355
02:47:36,340 --> 02:47:36,760
Viva la vida.

5356
02:47:37,240 --> 02:47:37,480
What?

5357
02:47:38,120 --> 02:47:38,380
Wait.

5358
02:47:39,460 --> 02:47:40,400
That's a cold place.

5359
02:47:43,380 --> 02:47:44,340
God damn it.

5360
02:47:44,460 --> 02:47:45,320
Stay in school case.

5361
02:47:45,580 --> 02:47:45,740
Don't you?

5362
02:47:46,220 --> 02:47:47,180
Viva la vida.

5363
02:47:47,660 --> 02:47:48,800
Viva la vida.

5364
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:52,060
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

5365
02:47:57,500 --> 02:47:58,960
Isn't that song from Shrek?

5366
02:47:59,900 --> 02:48:00,440
Viva la vida.

5367
02:48:00,440 --> 02:48:01,240
Wait, viva la vida?

5368
02:48:01,500 --> 02:48:03,160
No, viva la vida loca.

5369
02:48:03,520 --> 02:48:04,040
Oh, we are not...

5370
02:48:04,040 --> 02:48:05,820
Wait, we're not thinking the same song.

5371
02:48:06,060 --> 02:48:06,920
We are not...

5372
02:48:06,920 --> 02:48:07,840
Wait, Coldplay?

5373
02:48:08,320 --> 02:48:10,880
No, I wasn't saying Coldplay was Viva...

5374
02:48:10,880 --> 02:48:11,740
I was saying...

5375
02:48:11,740 --> 02:48:12,360
I thought I was like...

5376
02:48:12,360 --> 02:48:12,900
Coldplay?

5377
02:48:12,900 --> 02:48:14,060
Is that song from Shrek?

5378
02:48:14,500 --> 02:48:16,320
Viva la vida loca.

5379
02:48:17,960 --> 02:48:20,840
I hear Jerusalem bells.

5380
02:48:21,120 --> 02:48:21,740
I hear Jerusalem bells.

5381
02:48:21,740 --> 02:48:23,480
I can't believe it.

5382
02:48:23,480 --> 02:48:23,980
I can't believe it.

5383
02:48:24,200 --> 02:48:25,020
Fuck this shit.

5384
02:48:27,180 --> 02:48:27,820
Well...

5385
02:48:27,820 --> 02:48:29,700
Wait, is that Coldplay too?

5386
02:48:30,220 --> 02:48:31,480
Viva la loca?

5387
02:48:31,940 --> 02:48:32,420
Viva la...

5388
02:48:32,420 --> 02:48:33,100
No, that's...

5389
02:48:33,100 --> 02:48:33,880
That's another...

5390
02:48:33,880 --> 02:48:34,320
That's...

5391
02:48:34,320 --> 02:48:35,300
That's Ricky Martin.

5392
02:48:35,740 --> 02:48:35,940
Yeah.

5393
02:48:36,280 --> 02:48:37,180
Oh my god.

5394
02:48:38,400 --> 02:48:39,140
That's the...

5395
02:48:39,140 --> 02:48:39,380
Oh.

5396
02:48:39,940 --> 02:48:42,560
Yeah, my song is from Ricky Martin.

5397
02:48:42,880 --> 02:48:43,480
Not Cold...

5398
02:48:43,480 --> 02:48:45,280
I don't even know who the fuck Ricky Martin is.

5399
02:48:45,400 --> 02:48:46,100
I'm just at...

5400
02:48:46,100 --> 02:48:48,080
I was like, that's Ricky Martin.

5401
02:48:48,480 --> 02:48:49,620
Who's Ricky Martin?

5402
02:48:50,100 --> 02:48:51,180
I just know he's...

5403
02:48:51,180 --> 02:48:52,520
I just know the song is from Shrek.

5404
02:48:52,740 --> 02:48:55,160
I thought we were talking about Viva la vida from Coldplay.

5405
02:48:55,760 --> 02:48:56,500
I was talking about...

5406
02:48:56,500 --> 02:48:57,080
I thought we were...

5407
02:48:57,080 --> 02:49:00,200
You know that viral clip of the Coldplay concert?

5408
02:49:00,440 --> 02:49:03,080
Oh yeah, the one where they held each other and stuff.

5409
02:49:03,340 --> 02:49:04,980
That was so funny.

5410
02:49:05,300 --> 02:49:06,200
That blew up everywhere.

5411
02:49:06,820 --> 02:49:07,820
Oh my god.

5412
02:49:07,820 --> 02:49:09,080
You know...

5413
02:49:09,080 --> 02:49:09,840
People are like meeting it.

5414
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:11,800
Yeah, you know they just didn't do anything.

5415
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:14,220
Nobody would have like, clipped the video at all.

5416
02:49:16,120 --> 02:49:17,000
Put myself...

5417
02:49:20,500 --> 02:49:22,440
Yeah, it was Streisand Effect.

5418
02:49:23,040 --> 02:49:23,480
That's...

5419
02:49:23,480 --> 02:49:24,540
Yeah, the Streisand Effect.

5420
02:49:24,580 --> 02:49:25,660
That was crazy.

5421
02:49:26,240 --> 02:49:27,520
Yeah, and then like...

5422
02:49:27,520 --> 02:49:30,780
Yeah, the crazy part is, it was like, from the HR lady.

5423
02:49:31,820 --> 02:49:32,200
Yeah.

5424
02:49:32,200 --> 02:49:35,320
Yeah, it was like, when your HR lady is...

5425
02:49:35,320 --> 02:49:38,540
Is like, having an inter-office relationship.

5426
02:49:38,540 --> 02:49:40,020
Like, the head of HR.

5427
02:49:40,780 --> 02:49:42,660
Affair in front of all those people.

5428
02:49:42,800 --> 02:49:43,880
Like, it's just...

5429
02:49:43,880 --> 02:49:43,900
That's true.

5430
02:49:44,340 --> 02:49:44,620
Wow.

5431
02:49:44,860 --> 02:49:45,040
Yeah.

5432
02:49:45,240 --> 02:49:46,080
And then...

5433
02:49:46,080 --> 02:49:49,040
Yeah, and the fact that like, you know, they both had affairs too.

5434
02:49:50,060 --> 02:49:50,440
Mm-hmm.

5435
02:49:50,820 --> 02:49:51,080
Yeah.

5436
02:49:51,300 --> 02:49:51,880
And he was like...

5437
02:49:51,880 --> 02:49:52,640
Yeah, he's the CEO.

5438
02:49:52,800 --> 02:49:53,280
And she was...

5439
02:49:53,280 --> 02:49:54,460
She was head CEO...

5440
02:49:54,460 --> 02:49:56,720
Head HR and head CEO too.

5441
02:49:57,040 --> 02:49:58,380
I heard they both resigned though.

5442
02:49:58,500 --> 02:49:59,680
Wait, she still kept the position?

5443
02:49:59,680 --> 02:50:02,460
Wait, the HR lady is still the HR lady?

5444
02:50:02,800 --> 02:50:04,360
The CEO resigned though, didn't he?

5445
02:50:04,400 --> 02:50:05,460
Yeah, the CEO resigned.

5446
02:50:05,920 --> 02:50:10,340
But like, the fact that the HR lady, like, is still the HR lady?

5447
02:50:10,440 --> 02:50:12,600
After committing the worst HR...

5448
02:50:12,600 --> 02:50:13,500
Not the worst, obviously.

5449
02:50:13,700 --> 02:50:16,840
But like, one of like, the top offenses in HR.

5450
02:50:19,060 --> 02:50:20,300
She resigned today.

5451
02:50:20,520 --> 02:50:21,240
She resigned today.

5452
02:50:21,640 --> 02:50:21,780
Oh!

5453
02:50:22,300 --> 02:50:22,620
Okay.

5454
02:50:22,920 --> 02:50:23,520
Good for her.

5455
02:50:24,160 --> 02:50:25,180
Good for her.

5456
02:50:25,180 --> 02:50:26,300
Good for the...

5457
02:50:26,300 --> 02:50:27,580
Good for the company.

5458
02:50:28,640 --> 02:50:29,560
I'm gonna...

5459
02:50:29,560 --> 02:50:31,140
Bring me lasagna?

5460
02:50:31,860 --> 02:50:33,160
And eat food and stuff.

5461
02:50:33,620 --> 02:50:34,480
Yeah, me too.

5462
02:50:34,880 --> 02:50:36,460
But I had a great time, Lily.

5463
02:50:36,640 --> 02:50:37,180
That was really fun.

5464
02:50:37,240 --> 02:50:38,840
Yeah, that was such a fun collab.

5465
02:50:39,320 --> 02:50:41,720
We talked a lot about random.

5466
02:50:43,320 --> 02:50:45,360
My favorite conversation is...

5467
02:50:45,360 --> 02:50:49,980
You convincing me to chop off hair off of Michael and make a voodoo doll.

5468
02:50:49,980 --> 02:50:52,220
That was my favorite conversation, too!

5469
02:50:53,140 --> 02:50:55,660
I love that voodoo!

5470
02:50:59,920 --> 02:51:01,260
And don't drink and...

5471
02:51:01,260 --> 02:51:03,380
If I make the doll, I'll let you know.

5472
02:51:03,620 --> 02:51:04,000
Yeah, yeah.

5473
02:51:04,140 --> 02:51:05,340
Oh my god, you have to let me know.

5474
02:51:05,400 --> 02:51:07,180
I want to watch that stream when you do it.

5475
02:51:07,300 --> 02:51:09,200
I need to watch that stream.

5476
02:51:10,460 --> 02:51:11,840
I love voodoo.

5477
02:51:11,960 --> 02:51:13,000
Love voodoo.

5478
02:51:13,320 --> 02:51:15,560
Making my voodoo doll.

5479
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:17,920
I can... I can see it.

5480
02:51:21,420 --> 02:51:22,180
You okay?

5481
02:51:23,200 --> 02:51:25,060
You feeling saliva gets stuck in your throat?

5482
02:51:25,300 --> 02:51:26,380
Oh, yeah, I hate that.

5483
02:51:26,540 --> 02:51:26,680
Yeah.

5484
02:51:27,860 --> 02:51:28,300
Oh...

5485
02:51:28,300 --> 02:51:30,020
Yeah, hack it all out like a cat.

5486
02:51:34,500 --> 02:51:35,540
I have to mute my mic.

5487
02:51:36,480 --> 02:51:37,300
I was like...

5488
02:51:37,300 --> 02:51:37,500
Are you okay?

5489
02:51:37,500 --> 02:51:38,820
I'm gonna be a topic right now.

5490
02:51:41,240 --> 02:51:43,460
Well, it was fun hanging out today, Lily.

5491
02:51:43,520 --> 02:51:44,440
I had a great time.

5492
02:51:45,480 --> 02:51:46,580
Yeah, thanks for...

5493
02:51:46,580 --> 02:51:47,480
I'm dying.

5494
02:51:49,120 --> 02:51:49,860
Don't die.

5495
02:51:50,040 --> 02:51:51,820
If you die, you can't make your love voodoo.

5496
02:51:53,940 --> 02:51:55,520
It was nice talking to you.

5497
02:51:56,040 --> 02:51:56,480
Yeah!

5498
02:51:56,760 --> 02:51:58,980
It was great talking to you too, Lily.

5499
02:51:59,480 --> 02:51:59,960
I'm fine.

5500
02:51:59,960 --> 02:52:00,940
I hope you die.

5501
02:52:01,200 --> 02:52:02,540
I hope you don't die.

5502
02:52:02,800 --> 02:52:03,180
I hope you die?

5503
02:52:03,400 --> 02:52:03,460
What?

5504
02:52:03,760 --> 02:52:04,460
I hope you...

5505
02:52:04,460 --> 02:52:06,000
No, I said I hope you don't die.

5506
02:52:06,440 --> 02:52:06,720
I...

5507
02:52:06,720 --> 02:52:07,960
It's like...

5508
02:52:07,960 --> 02:52:08,720
Collabs over.

5509
02:52:08,720 --> 02:52:10,240
I hope you die now.

5510
02:52:12,460 --> 02:52:13,240
Good night.

5511
02:52:13,500 --> 02:52:14,440
Good night, Lily.

5512
02:52:15,080 --> 02:52:15,480
Good night.

5513
02:52:15,800 --> 02:52:16,940
Thanks for joining me.

5514
02:52:19,040 --> 02:52:20,720
Oh my god, that was so fun.

5515
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:21,760
I had a...

5516
02:52:21,760 --> 02:52:24,780
I had a fun time hanging out with Lily today.

5517
02:52:25,040 --> 02:52:25,440
I had a...

5518
02:52:25,440 --> 02:52:27,140
That was definitely a great collab idea.

5519
02:52:27,440 --> 02:52:28,640
Uh, I had with her.

5520
02:52:29,040 --> 02:52:31,280
Uh, I'd love to do more of these, I feel like.

5521
02:52:31,700 --> 02:52:32,060
Like...

5522
02:52:32,060 --> 02:52:33,400
Um, I was like thinking about it.

5523
02:52:33,420 --> 02:52:34,040
It's like, oh, if I...

5524
02:52:34,040 --> 02:52:38,420
What if I make this like a series where I drink with someone and we just draw random stuff together.

5525
02:52:38,860 --> 02:52:39,760
Um, and everything.

5526
02:52:39,960 --> 02:52:41,020
I felt like I was such...

5527
02:52:41,020 --> 02:52:41,980
That would be such a cute idea.

5528
02:52:42,080 --> 02:52:42,500
But I don't know.

5529
02:52:42,600 --> 02:52:43,340
I have so many things.

5530
02:52:43,660 --> 02:52:45,200
I already have so many things to do.

5531
02:52:47,200 --> 02:52:47,680
Uh...

5532
02:52:48,820 --> 02:52:49,300
But...

5533
02:52:49,300 --> 02:52:51,820
I definitely had a great time with Lily.

5534
02:52:52,040 --> 02:52:52,800
Talking to her.

5535
02:52:53,020 --> 02:52:53,800
While drinking.

5536
02:52:55,760 --> 02:52:56,240
Um...

5537
02:52:56,840 --> 02:52:57,320
And...

5538
02:52:57,320 --> 02:52:57,920
Um...

5539
02:52:57,920 --> 02:52:59,540
It was definitely, like, fun.

5540
02:52:59,760 --> 02:53:00,540
Just like...

5541
02:53:00,540 --> 02:53:03,180
You know, just trying to draw random things out of memory.

5542
02:53:03,380 --> 02:53:04,280
And like giving each other...

5543
02:53:05,400 --> 02:53:06,960
Describing what things look like.

5544
02:53:06,980 --> 02:53:09,060
And we're all trying to draw it from memory.

5545
02:53:09,060 --> 02:53:11,300
He he he he he he he he he.

5546
02:53:11,300 --> 02:53:11,940
He he he he he.

5547
02:53:12,720 --> 02:53:13,200
Um...

5548
02:53:13,200 --> 02:53:13,960
Um...

5549
02:53:13,960 --> 02:53:16,560
I hope you guys had a lot of fun too watching us.

5550
02:53:17,660 --> 02:53:18,140
Um...

5551
02:53:18,140 --> 02:53:18,860
Um...

5552
02:53:18,860 --> 02:53:19,700
Oh my gosh.

5553
02:53:19,880 --> 02:53:20,580
Whoa, fuck.

5554
02:53:20,640 --> 02:53:22,000
I definitely sobered up though.

5555
02:53:22,200 --> 02:53:23,720
When I was trying to do this artwork.

5556
02:53:24,020 --> 02:53:24,180
I...

5557
02:53:24,740 --> 02:53:25,220
I...

5558
02:53:27,660 --> 02:53:29,300
I definitely sobered up.

5559
02:53:29,480 --> 02:53:29,960
But...

5560
02:53:29,960 --> 02:53:30,760
Um...

5561
02:53:30,760 --> 02:53:33,360
But I definitely enjoyed all the conversations I had.

5562
02:53:33,360 --> 02:53:34,800
Even the really cursed ones.

5563
02:53:34,980 --> 02:53:35,400
There were some...

5564
02:53:35,400 --> 02:53:36,360
There were some fun conversations.

5565
02:53:37,540 --> 02:53:37,860
But...

5566
02:53:37,860 --> 02:53:38,360
Like I said.

5567
02:53:38,540 --> 02:53:40,440
I hope you guys had a lot of fun too.

5568
02:53:40,560 --> 02:53:41,120
For this collab.

5569
02:53:41,460 --> 02:53:41,600
Um...

5570
02:53:41,600 --> 02:53:43,460
Please check out the podcast that I did with Lily.

5571
02:53:44,400 --> 02:53:44,840
Um...

5572
02:53:44,840 --> 02:53:45,100
Um...

5573
02:53:45,100 --> 02:53:47,300
That was posted on the Sweet and Sour channel.

5574
02:53:47,300 --> 02:53:48,000
On YouTube.

5575
02:53:48,780 --> 02:53:49,220
And...

5576
02:53:49,220 --> 02:53:49,740
Uh...

5577
02:53:49,740 --> 02:53:50,080
Yeah.

5578
02:53:50,080 --> 02:53:52,440
I'm really looking forward to releasing a song with her.

5579
02:53:52,960 --> 02:53:53,400
Uh...

5580
02:53:53,400 --> 02:53:53,880
Well...

5581
02:53:53,880 --> 02:53:54,600
She wrote...

5582
02:53:54,600 --> 02:53:54,920
Like...

5583
02:53:54,920 --> 02:53:55,760
Well, she's not singing it.

5584
02:53:55,760 --> 02:53:56,360
I'm singing it.

5585
02:53:56,480 --> 02:53:58,660
But you know, she wrote the entire song with her producer.

5586
02:53:59,120 --> 02:53:59,560
Uh...

5587
02:53:59,560 --> 02:54:02,020
So I'm really looking forward to actually getting that done.

5588
02:54:02,720 --> 02:54:03,120
Um...

5589
02:54:03,120 --> 02:54:03,720
Either this month.

5590
02:54:03,920 --> 02:54:04,160
Not...

5591
02:54:04,160 --> 02:54:05,760
Not like the music video done then.

5592
02:54:05,820 --> 02:54:06,200
But like...

5593
02:54:06,200 --> 02:54:08,100
Me recording the song done.

5594
02:54:08,340 --> 02:54:09,660
Either this month or next month.

5595
02:54:09,820 --> 02:54:10,120
So...

5596
02:54:10,120 --> 02:54:11,240
I'm really looking forward to that.

5597
02:54:11,460 --> 02:54:12,020
Anyway guys!

5598
02:54:12,280 --> 02:54:13,480
I'm gonna call it here.

5599
02:54:13,720 --> 02:54:14,120
Now...

5600
02:54:14,120 --> 02:54:15,000
I'm gonna call it here.

5601
02:54:15,160 --> 02:54:16,720
But I hope you guys had a fun time watching.

5602
02:54:17,020 --> 02:54:18,000
As always everybody.

5603
02:54:18,220 --> 02:54:18,980
Stay hydrated.

5604
02:54:19,180 --> 02:54:19,600
Posture check.

5605
02:54:19,720 --> 02:54:20,360
Get up and move around.

5606
02:54:20,480 --> 02:54:21,400
To get that blood flowing.

5607
02:54:21,540 --> 02:54:22,040
And if you...

5608
02:54:22,040 --> 02:54:22,700
So for me...

5609
02:54:22,700 --> 02:54:23,540
Head to bed.

5610
02:54:23,720 --> 02:54:24,120
Cause...

5611
02:54:24,120 --> 02:54:25,000
You deserve it.

5612
02:54:25,120 --> 02:54:26,320
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

5613
02:54:26,880 --> 02:54:27,560
Bye guys!

5614
02:54:28,020 --> 02:54:28,420
Bye!

5615
02:54:29,780 --> 02:54:31,240
Also it was nice to dry again.

5616
02:54:31,240 --> 02:54:32,300
It's been a very long time.

5617
02:54:32,560 --> 02:54:33,820
Since I've lost the art.

5618
02:54:34,160 --> 02:54:34,320
Uh...

5619
02:54:34,320 --> 02:54:34,460
But yeah.

5620
02:54:34,580 --> 02:54:35,140
Bye bye guys!

5621
02:54:35,420 --> 02:54:35,700
Bye!

5622
02:54:35,700 --> 02:54:36,160
Bye!
