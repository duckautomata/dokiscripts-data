1
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,210
Hello, everybody.

2
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:52,510
Oh my god, starting off the fucking stream strong.

3
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,030
Hello, hello.

4
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:58,010
Oh my god.

5
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,510
Okay, I do sound a lot better.

6
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:00,690
I'm still coughing.

7
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:08,470
Bad news, I was not able to go to the hospital for the antibiotics because...

8
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,990
I sort of slept the whole day.

9
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,650
I have no excuse.

10
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:20,550
I legitimately was so tired after the back-to-back tournament that I just slept the whole day.

11
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,310
Like, no other excuses.

12
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,270
I was just extremely exhausted.

13
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:25,650
So, yeah.

14
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:34,530
Also, I heated my leftovers for dinner, so I might be munching on some leftovers from last night.

15
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,970
Do I sound better?

16
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:41,890
I sound a lot better.

17
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:42,970
Guys, no, you don't understand.

18
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,190
I literally spent the last two days just sleeping.

19
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:53,890
The first break day on Monday, I was just so tired.

20
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,710
I just slept most of the day.

21
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:57,650
And then...

22
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,850
Okay, you guys might have seen it because people already posted clips of it.

23
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:04,850
And I played Marvel Rivals late at night because I have a problem.

24
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,090
And we all know that I have a problem.

25
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,510
Thank you for the super chat.

26
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,210
Thank you, thank you.

27
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,630
You're your own worst enemy sometimes.

28
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,790
Thank you for the super chat.

29
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:14,910
Thank you, thank you.

30
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:26,130
So, there is a clip of Nekros as Spider-Man pulling me off the cliff from fucking Narnia.

31
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,730
And it was not a good day for me.

32
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:29,630
That was not...

33
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,330
And then, because of that, I Tilt-Q'd.

34
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,070
Well, not because of what he did.

35
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:38,630
But also, I was having some very fucking terrible rank...

36
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,750
I was having a very terrible rank grind.

37
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:41,810
How terrible, you might ask?

38
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,970
I'm down 150 points.

39
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,050
That's how terrible it was.

40
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:48,650
It was not a good day.

41
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:55,870
And because I was so depressed over that, next day...

42
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:59,930
I just slept the whole day yesterday as well.

43
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:00,470
I...

44
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,590
I...

45
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,510
I...

46
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,170
I slept...

47
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,070
Okay, not 150.

48
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:08,990
It was like 120.

49
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,010
I'll say 120 points.

50
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:14,510
It was more like 120 points in one session.

51
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:15,690
In one rank session.

52
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:17,370
It was just...

53
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:18,530
It was not a great day.

54
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:22,890
And then, the second day, I was very sad.

55
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,790
Not because of Marvel Rivals.

56
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:26,830
And tired.

57
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:31,050
Okay, it wasn't because I was just depressed because of Marvel Rivals.

58
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,690
I was still very, very tired.

59
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:38,870
So, yesterday, I spent the entire day also sleeping.

60
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:42,070
And...

61
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,850
And just like...

62
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,950
I just fucking hibernated the entire time.

63
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,010
I legitimately...

64
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,330
I got into my morning meeting.

65
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:48,630
My morning meeting with my manager.

66
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:49,890
Just to be like...

67
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,330
Okay, these are the things I have to do.

68
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:52,570
And shit like that.

69
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,810
And also, let me know if the BGM is loud enough.

70
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,150
Just to be like...

71
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,210
These are the things I have to do.

72
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:57,650
And I was like...

73
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:57,890
Alright.

74
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,490
And then, my manager was like...

75
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:01,030
Okay, so...

76
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:03,710
So, like...

77
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:04,530
After that...

78
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:05,650
You're gonna work on this, right?

79
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:06,450
You're gonna go to the hospital.

80
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,010
Bring your laptop and work on this.

81
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:08,610
And I was like, yeah.

82
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:11,230
And then, after the call was over...

83
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:12,350
I...

84
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,190
Went to bed.

85
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,450
And just slept.

86
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,430
I just...

87
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:22,010
I just went to bed and just...

88
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:22,310
Bye.

89
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,030
I'm gone.

90
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,110
I'm fucking gone.

91
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,390
And I woke up.

92
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:28,570
I woke up.

93
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:29,410
3 in the morning.

94
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,470
And then, I was just like...

95
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:31,710
Alright.

96
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:34,170
Well, I woke up earlier to grab something to eat.

97
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:34,670
Because I was like...

98
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,170
I should at least get some food in my system.

99
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:39,010
And after eating, I spent a little bit of time on the PC.

100
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,890
And then, I didn't play my revivals yesterday.

101
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:43,290
Because I was still depressed over losing 120 points.

102
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,750
I was still depressed.

103
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:51,530
And...

104
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:53,210
I just literally just...

105
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,190
Did my stuff.

106
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:57,770
Walked...

107
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,890
Yogi Amber Doge.

108
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:00,470
At like...

109
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,230
3 in the morning.

110
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:02,870
And then, slept again.

111
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,070
And then, slept all the way till today.

112
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,590
And I woke up today at 12.

113
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:09,830
And I was like...

114
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,690
I'm just gonna be lazy.

115
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,030
I was a lazy day.

116
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,170
I felt so lazy.

117
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,510
After winning that tournament...

118
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,230
I was just not a person.

119
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:17,810
I don't know.

120
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,010
I think like...

121
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,550
Waking up at 8 AM.

122
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:22,710
All those...

123
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,290
Waking up at 8 AM too.

124
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:25,710
For all those hours.

125
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:26,390
Just like...

126
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:26,830
I don't know.

127
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:27,830
It fucking ruined me.

128
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:34,740
The back to back 8 AM streams.

129
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,620
And then, also streaming for 8 hours straight.

130
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,040
Playing my revivals.

131
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,980
It just fucked me up.

132
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,720
It also ruined dad's fucking feeding schedule.

133
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,880
Cause now he thinks he's gonna get fed at 8 AM all the time.

134
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,060
He wakes me up at 8 AM.

135
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,200
I'm so angry.

136
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,260
He wakes me up at 8 to 9 AM for feeding.

137
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,080
Because of...

138
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,060
Because of 2 days.

139
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,280
Just 2 days of fucked up schedules.

140
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,900
He thinks his feeding time is now 8 to 9 AM.

141
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,040
I'm like...

142
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,020
It's 2 days.

143
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,280
How could 2 days change your entire life?

144
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,120
Doki.

145
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,160
How?

146
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,320
Like, I don't understand.

147
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,540
So like, now he wakes me up at 8 to 9 AM.

148
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,660
Cause he's like...

149
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,000
Woo, feeding time.

150
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,300
And I'm like, no it's not.

151
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,280
But then he doesn't stop barking.

152
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,440
He'll be like...

153
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,960
It's feeding time.

154
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,660
And I'm like, it's 8 in the fucking morning.

155
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:28,600
Like...

156
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,880
He knows I can get up early.

157
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,800
Yes, he knows that I can get up earlier.

158
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,600
That's the worst part.

159
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,880
He fucking knows.

160
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,240
Because before then, he wouldn't wake me up earlier.

161
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,080
Cause he's like, oh, she'll never wake up this early.

162
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,140
But now that he knows that I can wake up that early.

163
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,960
He wakes me up early now.

164
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,980
And I'm like, no.

165
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,960
I'm just like, no.

166
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,220
And I try to like, fix him.

167
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,640
To go back to my old schedule.

168
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,980
Because I was like, I can't.

169
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,640
I'm not a per...

170
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,340
Like, I had to feed him yesterday.

171
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,240
At like, the last 2 days.

172
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,000
At like, 9 AM or some shit.

173
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,820
And I go back to sleep.

174
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,700
Because I just can't.

175
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,440
I legitimately will not be awake.

176
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,080
I'm not a person.

177
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,560
Warren, thank you for the super chat.

178
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,480
Thank you, thank you.

179
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,540
Won't ink this.

180
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,620
The consequences of my own actions.

181
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,960
Thank you for the super chat.

182
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,360
Thank you, thank you.

183
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:19,820
But yeah.

184
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,900
Also, like, I need to tell you guys this.

185
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,560
I don't remember if this was yesterday or the day before yesterday.

186
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,820
But like, while I was like, hibernating.

187
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,340
And like, I don't know.

188
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,060
Basically being dead.

189
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,060
While I was hibernating.

190
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,660
I woke up at like, 3 in the morning.

191
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:37,760
To walk him.

192
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,860
Because like, I need to fix his schedule too.

193
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,840
Because like, his walk schedule is like, so fucked up now.

194
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,120
Like, his walking schedule is really fucked up.

195
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,620
Because like, I walked him at like, 3 PM.

196
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:55,180
So then he's like, oh now, he thinks his walking hours is like, 2 to 3 AM.

197
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:55,860
So anyway.

198
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,760
So like, I'm trying to fix that.

199
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,400
So like, I'm going to be walking him earlier today to fix that schedule.

200
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:03,800
Anyway.

201
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:04,820
So.

202
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,180
I walked him at 3 AM today.

203
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,320
Not today, sorry.

204
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,400
One of those rest days.

205
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,140
And it was so fucking weird.

206
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,200
Because, while on the walk.

207
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,620
There was a phone on the ground.

208
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,020
And like, I was...

209
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,360
It was so weird.

210
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,540
It was so ominous.

211
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:25,760
Because I was like, why is there a fucking random phone just lying on the ground.

212
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,580
On the sidewalk.

213
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,840
Because I was like, that's weird.

214
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:29,440
I've never...

215
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,180
And then the next...

216
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,680
The morning, when I did his morning walk.

217
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,560
It was gone.

218
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,360
So like, I was like, why is there this random...

219
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,680
I took a picture of it too.

220
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,860
Because I was so confused.

221
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,600
I was like, this is not right.

222
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,360
I was like, why is this here?

223
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,680
Like, I was so confused.

224
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,360
I was like, this ain't right.

225
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,200
Why is...

226
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,240
So look, look, look.

227
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,480
I found this random phone on the sidewalk.

228
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,920
Because I was like...

229
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,460
I didn't pick it up.

230
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,720
I took a picture of it.

231
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,240
But it was 3 in the morning.

232
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,780
It was 3 in the morning.

233
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,520
I was like, I took a picture of it.

234
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,500
Because I was so...

235
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,700
I thought it was weird.

236
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,080
Yeah, a random flip phone.

237
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,600
Yeah, I was like, did a crime happen?

238
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,260
Like...

239
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,700
Was there some sort of like, deal that happened in the middle of the night?

240
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,160
Like, I...

241
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,040
Like...

242
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:21,900
Yeah.

243
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:22,800
I...

244
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,480
I didn't pick it up.

245
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,520
Because I knew...

246
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,600
I knew that's weird.

247
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,200
I...

248
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,740
I knew if I picked it up...

249
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:36,460
I might be like, inflicted in some fucking crime.

250
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:39,580
Like...

251
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,900
So like, I didn't want to get my fingerprints on it.

252
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,600
But I did take a picture of it.

253
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,400
I took a picture.

254
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,060
Because I was like, that's weird.

255
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,480
Anyway...

256
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,020
The next...

257
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,120
The morning of...

258
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,500
Like, obviously, you know, because he needs his morning walks.

259
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,360
Like, the phone was gone.

260
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,480
It was gone.

261
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,140
Like...

262
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,140
Like, I was just...

263
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,140
I was like, why is this here at 3 in the morning?

264
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,620
And it was like, in the middle of the sidewalk too.

265
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:06,560
Like, I...

266
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,200
I don't know.

267
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,000
I almost picked it up.

268
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,480
I...

269
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,060
I was so close to picking this up.

270
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:16,880
I almost did.

271
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,920
I was just like, oh my god.

272
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,380
Like, what is this doing there?

273
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:24,840
Like...

274
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,080
I didn't.

275
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:28,620
Okay?

276
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,760
I didn't listen to my...

277
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,520
I didn't listen to the thoughts in my head.

278
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,120
No, it was gone.

279
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,280
Someone picked it up.

280
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,580
I don't know who.

281
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,000
But someone picked it up in the morning.

282
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:45,880
Like...

283
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,600
No, there is chat.

284
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,260
It's just the burner phone is covering it.

285
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,200
Oh wait, there is no chat.

286
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:51,740
What the fuck?

287
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,920
I thought I fixed it.

288
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,740
You're right.

289
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,000
There was no chat.

290
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:58,700
Where is it?

291
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,700
Okay, there it is.

292
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,340
Yeah, so like...

293
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,320
That's basically...

294
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,240
What happened.

295
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:05,640
During...

296
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,240
It was not very exciting last couple of days though.

297
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,660
NotSoDeadphone, thank you for the super chat.

298
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,320
Thank you, thank you.

299
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,460
That phone was a miserable story quest.

300
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,720
You're gonna have to try again on a new game.

301
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:17,180
Bless.

302
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,760
Thank you for the super chat.

303
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,680
Thank you, thank you.

304
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,820
Also, you don't train dad at this point.

305
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,960
He trains you.

306
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,600
I know.

307
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,040
He's basically...

308
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,880
He's doing his best.

309
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,980
Doing his absolute best.

310
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,460
Liz, thank you for the super chat.

311
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,300
Thank you, thank you.

312
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,980
Octopic, good news Doki.

313
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:33,660
I found the plus.

314
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,480
FYI, information for you because I only won one prize.

315
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,160
So don't give me the Torobo box.

316
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,040
So I can't exactly prove I won from there.

317
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,140
But shipping to you soon.

318
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,600
It's alright.

319
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,720
As long as we have our super buff bear plush.

320
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,940
I'll be happy.

321
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,360
Thank you for the super chat, Liz.

322
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,340
Thank you, thank you.

323
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:49,760
Also...

324
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,120
I'll take this time...

325
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,720
To show you guys an update.

326
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,460
So...

327
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,120
What I'm going to be showing you is actually from...

328
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,720
Parts from the charity outfit auction.

329
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,560
So you guys remember...

330
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:11,740
There was a charity auction for an outfit that was decided by the winner of the auction.

331
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,380
They also picked expressions.

332
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,380
So, I was getting my expressions updated on my skin suit.

333
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:19,960
Not this one.

334
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,280
But the one that's being rigged at the moment.

335
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:30,060
So, they added some of the expressions that the winner requested onto me.

336
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,460
So, I'll show you guys the update.

337
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:32,880
Woah!

338
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,800
Woah, skin suit update.

339
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,060
I can't change my hair color or anything.

340
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,440
Or like my hair or whatever.

341
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,860
Like what Mint did.

342
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,780
But I have new faces I can make.

343
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,620
And other than...

344
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,460
Okay, so this one, we requested this.

345
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,260
We requested this before.

346
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,940
Which was done a long time ago.

347
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,260
But like, I procrastinated.

348
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,300
So...

349
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,260
So...

350
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,380
After my Marvel rivals...

351
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,490
Guys...

352
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,600
Just one more game, guys.

353
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:04,940
Just...

354
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,740
Just one more game.

355
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,100
I swear to God.

356
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:12,900
Guys...

357
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,500
Just one more game.

358
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,560
I swear to God.

359
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,220
Last game.

360
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:17,680
LG.

361
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,280
This is LG, guys.

362
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,200
I just need two wins.

363
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,820
Okay, two LGs.

364
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,240
I just need two wins, guys.

365
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:25,960
Please.

366
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,600
Okay.

367
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,440
Anyway.

368
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:37,040
The next three are actually from the auction winner.

369
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,640
So, you can thank her for these pics.

370
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:41,420
So...

371
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:41,640
Oh, wait.

372
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,180
This is actually...

373
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:42,720
No, this is bonus.

374
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,380
So, this is just me blushing a little.

375
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,260
My whole teehee.

376
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:52,750
So, it's just like more of a blush.

377
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:53,690
Right here.

378
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:55,070
But then...

379
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:57,290
But then, these two were requested.

380
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,440
The doom and gloom.

381
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,260
Please, guys.

382
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,140
It'll be over soon.

383
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,080
Oh, yeah.

384
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:19,780
Me looking for it.

385
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,840
I was like, where's the map?

386
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,560
Where is it?

387
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:23,540
Oh, so...

388
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:23,680
Okay.

389
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,460
So, this one.

390
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,280
You fucking freak.

391
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:31,850
Oh,

392
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:35,740
my God.

393
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,740
So, this was the requested one.

394
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:38,500
Alright.

395
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,240
I'll fucking take you that off, though.

396
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:45,760
Yes.

397
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,740
Also, I'm calling the personnel.

398
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:52,500
For those who wanna know who won this particular...

399
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,840
Who won this particular auction to have all of that.

400
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,000
It is...

401
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,680
You have to thank Nexty for that.

402
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,660
So, yeah.

403
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,360
That was...

404
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,060
This was...

405
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:05,500
This specifically was also Nexty's...

406
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,280
That would make sense in context.

407
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:18,060
So, you gotta thank her for adding that expression.

408
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,680
Thank you for the super chat, Nexty.

409
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,280
Thank you.

410
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,200
Thank you.

411
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,200
So, yes.

412
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,880
I have new updates.

413
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,960
Thank you for the super chat.

414
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:27,240
Thank you.

415
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:27,680
Thank you.

416
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,040
We're so winning.

417
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,580
Thank you for the super chat.

418
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:30,940
Thank you.

419
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:31,800
Thank you.

420
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,480
But honestly, my favorite one so far was...

421
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,920
What context is it?

422
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:39,460
True.

423
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,660
Here's my favorite one.

424
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,120
This one is...

425
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,800
This is how I feel everyday.

426
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:49,780
Jesus.

427
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,520
Jesus.

428
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,100
Whoa, Jesus.

429
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,100
For you, Jesus.

430
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:57,660
I'll do it.

431
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,060
Thank you for the super chat.

432
00:16:59,440 --> 00:16:59,580
Thank you.

433
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,080
Damn, Jesus.

434
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,440
Oh,

435
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:06,920
my God.

436
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,780
Jesus.

437
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:09,990
Oh, my God.

438
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,640
Somebody's going to hell and it ain't me.

439
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,080
Rest in peace.

440
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,660
No, I like...

441
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,360
Calm down, Jesus.

442
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,140
So, yeah.

443
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,980
So, those are the updates for me today.

444
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:38,840
I have no idea what the schedule is going to be like for this week.

445
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,500
I am taking it so much more chill.

446
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,100
Because...

447
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:43,900
I don't know.

448
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,760
The last two days...

449
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,000
Who is this canary?

450
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,020
Lay off the bath salts.

451
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,820
Thank you for the super chat.

452
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:53,460
Fuck it.

453
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:53,840
Thank you.

454
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,520
Thank you.

455
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,400
Yeah, Jesus being a little freaky right now.

456
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,800
But, yes.

457
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,200
This week, I have no idea.

458
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:03,900
Because, like...

459
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,740
I have been super lazy the last two days.

460
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:09,820
I don't know why.

461
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:13,180
The Vtuber Rivals thing really threw me off.

462
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,660
Because, it was so intense.

463
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,480
It was just such an intense tournament.

464
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,400
Like, apparently, it was like...

465
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,240
It was 130 teams.

466
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,020
And, it was such an intense tournament.

467
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,200
That, like...

468
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,600
Like, my whole body, like, just...

469
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,700
My whole body was just like...

470
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,300
I'm done.

471
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,920
Yeah, and it did help that...

472
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,620
I had to IGL for it.

473
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,420
So, like, you know.

474
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,400
I had to, like, think a lot for that tournament as well.

475
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:44,920
So...

476
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,100
So, like, obviously, I was like...

477
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,900
I was just, like, using up all my energy and everything.

478
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:52,480
Yeah.

479
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,760
It was intense.

480
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:54,960
It was very, very intense.

481
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,540
I might maybe make a...

482
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,060
I've edited a video of it.

483
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,500
Because, it was actually a really...

484
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,040
It was a great...

485
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,800
It was a great time.

486
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,440
Thank you for the super chat.

487
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:02,760
Thank you.

488
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,200
Thank you.

489
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,020
Jesus just needs a little assistance.

490
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:08,000
Don't you want the second coming of Jesus?

491
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,180
Oh my God.

492
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,280
Thank you for the super chat.

493
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,040
Thank you.

494
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,000
Thank you.

495
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,300
Wait.

496
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,740
Is it fucked up?

497
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,640
Am I going to hell if I say, like...

498
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:26,070
Guys, would I go to hell if I say that, like...

499
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,150
Isn't Jesus, you know...

500
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,980
Isn't Jesus technically...

501
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:45,720
Okay, guys.

502
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,320
Guys.

503
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,260
I'm not religious.

504
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,500
But, like...

505
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,960
I don't know if that makes it better or not for me to say this.

506
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:52,380
Guys.

507
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:52,880
Guys.

508
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,060
Guys.

509
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,140
Is there a priest here where I can go to confession after?

510
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:01,860
Anyway.

511
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,360
Isn't he, like, sort of, you know...

512
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:07,980
A virgin?

513
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,740
Like...

514
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,640
I'm sorry.

515
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,460
I'm...

516
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,440
I'm sorry.

517
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,220
I'm sorry.

518
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:14,660
I'm...

519
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,800
Oh, boy.

520
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:21,580
And...

521
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,180
Wow.

522
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,300
It's Ash Wednesday.

523
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,520
Doki.

524
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,000
Jesus was made in the list.

525
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,760
Yeah, I mean, thank you for the super chat.

526
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,080
Thank you.

527
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:35,860
Thank you, Jesus.

528
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,200
The OG Cooner.

529
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,120
Thank you for the super chat.

530
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,840
Thank you for the super chat.

531
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,860
Well, technically, you were all here for this.

532
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,740
So, we're all going to hell unless we all repent.

533
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:47,900
Because you...

534
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,040
You guys enabled me.

535
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,520
Because you guys were part of the problem.

536
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,060
So, like...

537
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,040
We're all going...

538
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,660
We're all going somewhere together.

539
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:56,860
We're all...

540
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,560
You watched this stream.

541
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,980
So, you are part of the problem.

542
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:04,840
Yeah.

543
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,620
You chose to say it.

544
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,440
Meme.

545
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,960
Thank you for the 10 gifted ships.

546
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:13,300
Thank you.

547
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,120
Thank you.

548
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:16,620
Monkey.

549

Thank you.

552

DJ.

553
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,000
No, no.

554
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,440
She's got a point.

555
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,360
Thank you for the super chat.

556
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:24,980
Thank you.

557
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:25,900
Thank you.

558
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:26,760
Warren.

559
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
He wishes to spread his love.

560
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,560
Thank you for the super chat.

561
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:30,940
Thank you.

562
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:31,680
Thank you.

563
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:32,800
Mehdi.

564
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,000
Thank you.

565
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,280
That's why people...

566
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,400
Become a wizard.

567
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,500
They don't pay by the time they're 30.

568
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,420
Thank you for the super chat, Mehdi.

569
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:42,760
Thank you.

570
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,900
Wait, that makes him the ultimate wizard.

571
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,520
Is that...

572
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,340
Is that true?

573
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,920
I thought, like...

574
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,940
Jesus doesn't believe in magic.

575
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:54,800
Cafe.

576
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,760
Thank you for your very brave super chat.

577
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:00,580
Oh, my God.

578
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:04,260
This is a topic where he's like, You know what?

579
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,700
You deserve my money.

580
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,680
After calling out Jesus as a virgin.

581
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,740
That's crazy.

582
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,540
That's crazy.

583
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,720
I called him out and he's like, That's my streamer.

584
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,880
Right there.

585
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,260
CafeClown.

586
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,360
Thank you for the super chat.

587
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:22,740
Thank you.

588
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,460
Thank you.

589
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,400
I didn't think heaven was chill like that.

590
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,400
Guess I'll read more scripts.

591
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,980
Thank you for the super chat.

592
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:32,300
Thank you.

593
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:32,960
Thank you.

594
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,360
Heck, thank you for the Akasupa.

595
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,020
Thank you.

596
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:36,880
Thank you.

597
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,520
Repentance tax to go...

598
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,060
Guys, I mean...

599
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,760
Wait, is it fucked up if I...

600
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,440
Okay, what was it?

601
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,200
Uh...

602
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,240
Church...

603
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:47,740
Donation...

604
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,480
Oh, boy.

605
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,380
What is it called?

606
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,820
You know that little...

607
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,700
The little bowl they pass around?

608
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,780
Oh, this one.

609
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,280
Is it fucked up if...

610
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,720
Oh, I definitely am going somewhere.

611
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:05,960
That's...

612
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,900
That's great.

613
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,620
No, is it fucked up if like...

614
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,580
You know...

615
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:10,980
Like...

616
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,480
Like, if I put this out...

617
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:14,580
Here...

618
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,520
Like this...

619
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:16,960
And then...

620
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,080
Oh, wait, let me reset this.

621
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,860
If I put this here...

622
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,940
Like that, you know?

623
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,080
You know, like the thing that you pass around or that?

624
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,780
And then I...

625
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,760
And then I put...

626
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,260
And then I put...

627
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,500
Is this fucked up?

628
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,540
Am I going somewhere?

629
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,080
Am I going somewhere if I put this down here?

630
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:58,150
Am I going somewhere if I do this?

631
00:23:58,530 --> 00:23:59,030
Am I...

632
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:02,590
And then...

633
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,730
Wait, wait, where's my...

634
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:04,530
Where's my alert?

635
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:05,450
Where is it?

636
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:07,230
Okay, so my alert's over here.

637
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:09,630
So then all I have to do...

638
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:11,470
Is move the alert right here.

639
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:14,210
If I...

640
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:16,350
If I move the alert here...

641
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:17,710
Then it'll make more sense.

642
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:23,410
AK, thank you for the super chat.

643
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:24,610
Thank you, thank you.

644
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:26,370
Simple-minded.

645
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:28,330
Doki...

646
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:31,910
If you have to start a sentence like that, you already know.

647
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:34,330
Thank you for the super chat.

648
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:35,530
Thank you, thank you.

649
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:36,950
Oh shit, let me put this...

650
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,050
Oh, now it makes sense!

651
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:39,370
Guys, look at that!

652
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,530
Wait, this works!

653
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:41,830
Wait, this...

654
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:45,830
Doki buying a new way to get to the big downstairs.

655
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:49,130
Save a spot for us too.

656
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,430
Thank you for the super chat.

657
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:54,050
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

658
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:55,330
Wait, this works!

659
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:56,310
Guys!

660
00:24:56,310 --> 00:25:01,370
I like how it's like dad's dancing on the repentance.

661
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,790
Dancing in the little...

662
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:04,600
The little thing.

663
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:06,870
Wait, this makes so much sense.

664
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:10,190
Does this count as a tax rate?

665
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,210
Thank you for the super chat.

666
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:14,440
Thank you, thank you.

667
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,130
Wolfhound, thank you for the super chat.

668
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:19,090
Thank you, thank you.

669
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:24,010
Putting a fake dollar bill into the donation bowl so I go to hell.

670
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:25,510
I mean, see...

671
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:29,270
Thank you for the super chat.

672
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:31,190
Thank you, thank you.

673
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,110
This five is for the bulk.

674
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,410
I mean religion.

675
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:37,070
Golden, thank you for the super chat.

676
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:38,110
Thank you, thank you.

677
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:38,710
Yeah!

678
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:39,890
Is that what they say?

679
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:42,150
The more you donate, the more heaven you get?

680
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:42,730
Yeah!

681
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,150
Like, remember those like...

682
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:45,630
What was it called?

683
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:46,310
Like the...

684
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:48,050
The ones that are actual scams.

685
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:48,890
This isn't a scam.

686
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:51,350
But the one where they do like the tele...

687
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,470
The TV relig...

688
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:53,590
The TV churches.

689
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:54,570
You know?

690
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:55,890
Where, um...

691
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:57,250
What are they called?

692
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:58,410
The...

693
00:25:58,410 --> 00:25:59,550
Like, you know where they're like...

694
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:02,750
You gotta send your money to this church now.

695
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:03,470
And then...

696
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,430
Yeah, the televen...

697
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,250
The tele...

698
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:06,890
Televangelist.

699
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:08,030
I fucking can't pronounce it.

700
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:08,630
Yeah!

701
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:09,890
This is not that one.

702
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,790
This is like different because we're not on TV.

703
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:12,450
We're on...

704
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:16,130
It's different.

705
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,470
Because we're not on TV.

706
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:18,730
We're on the internet.

707
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:20,490
So this is a lot different.

708
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:21,110
Um...

709
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:24,370
Um...

710
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:25,810
Yes.

711
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:27,070
I will...

712
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:27,870
Anyway.

713
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,450
So you know how they're like...

714
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:30,290
It's just a call.

715
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:33,630
Jason, thank you for your very first super chat.

716
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:34,490
Thank you.

717
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:35,350
Thank you.

718
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:36,570
Um...

719
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:37,510
So like, you know.

720
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:38,430
Um...

721
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,030
They would do that.

722
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:39,430
They're like...

723
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:40,330
Oh, the more you...

724
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,170
You'd send your...

725
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:42,770
Send your money right now.

726
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,790
To like this address.

727
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:45,490
And...

728
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:46,450
And Jesus...

729
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:48,490
And God will forgive your sin.

730
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:53,530
But for me...

731
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:54,510
I'll be like...

732
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:56,650
A super chat right now.

733
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:59,630
So you can see dad dancing on the pole.

734
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,110
Brother, thank you for the super chat.

735
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:04,570
Thank you.

736
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:05,250
Thank you.

737
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:09,130
All it took was a pole for chat to unfold.

738
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:10,330
Um...

739
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:11,070
Johnny...

740
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:11,930
Thank you for the super chat.

741
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:12,230
Thank you.

742
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:12,570
Thank you.

743
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:13,050
Behold.

744
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:16,010
The rise of stream evangelists.

745
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:17,310
Don't you...

746
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,650
Stop giving them ideas.

747
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:20,290
Oh my God.

748
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:23,530
Why don't they just stream on like YouTube and Twitch for their...

749
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:24,430
Wait, what's the point?

750
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:27,770
Since we're in the new age, people don't watch TV anymore anyway.

751
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:28,590
So like...

752
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:30,810
So like...

753
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:32,530
I feel like if they...

754
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:34,790
If they're gonna keep doing this tradition...

755
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,990
They could do sermons on stream.

756
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:38,210
Like...

757
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:38,870
Did you guys...

758
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:39,730
I mean like...

759
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:41,250
It's such a great idea.

760
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,630
And then like...

761
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:44,250
They can have like super chat enable.

762
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:45,430
It'd be like...

763
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:48,250
One Akasupa equals one confession.

764
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:53,330
If you...

765
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:56,650
If you want God to forgive you...

766
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:59,450
Make sure to super chat on Akasupa.

767
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,430
They already do?

768
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:03,730
Oh my God.

769
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:05,630
They're so ahead of their time.

770
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,330
Oh my God.

771
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,610
Bro, I just figured that out today.

772
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:13,250
Confession stream when...

773
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:14,510
When they actually...

774
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,910
I saw like a priest TikTok account.

775
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:19,410
Like an actual priest that does like...

776
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:20,730
Like TikToks and stuff.

777
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:22,350
To like raise...

778
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:23,950

779
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:24,570

780
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:25,510
Make religion...

781
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,930
Make like Christianity cool again.

782
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:28,650
To like...

783
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:30,730
Be hip with the youngins.

784
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:37,810
Angel, thank you for the super chat.

785
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:38,450

794
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:53,430
Is it Ash Wednesday?

795
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:55,070
Oh my God.

796
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:56,030
We're all going...

797
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:58,090
Wait.

798
00:28:58,530 --> 00:28:59,450

799
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:00,850
Oh, fuck.

00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:01,850

00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,850
We're all going somewhere.

803
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:18,010
We're

804
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:23,490

805
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,950
We're so fucked.

806
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:31,290
Zekro, thank you for the akasupa.

807
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:32,450
Thank you, thank you.

808
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:34,470
I'm here to confess my sins.

809
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:36,550
I'm not washing up jokey boy.

810
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:37,730
Even on my breaks.

811
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:39,170
The vibes aren't enough.

812
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:41,410
Please allow me to repent.

813
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:43,270
Thank you for the akasupa.

814
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:44,550
Thank you, thank you.

815
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:45,930
Um, Casey.

816
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:47,570
Welcome to the maid of fire.

817
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:48,750
Welcome, welcome.

818
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:50,050

819
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:52,630
Please don't drag me with the others.

820
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:55,850
At least it'll be warm.

821
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:56,270
True.

822
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:57,470
True.

823
00:29:58,050 --> 00:29:59,850
Um, it'll be warm though, DJ.

824
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:00,850

00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:01,770

Thank you, thank you.

829
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:08,830
Jokey, they did the forgiving sins for super chat 600 years ago.

830
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:14,250
And it led to 100 years of war in Europe because of the prison reformation.

831
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:15,370
Thank you for the super chat.

832
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:16,030
Thank you, thank you.

833
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:18,270
Yeah, but it hasn't happened in NA yet.

834
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:20,310
First time for everything.

835
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:23,910
You know, first time for everything, guys.

836
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:31,290
Um, Kira.

837
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:32,630
Welcome to the tomato farm.

838
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:33,770
Thank you, thank you.

839
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:36,650
Um, Bexa.

Thank you for the super chat.

841
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:38,890
Thank you, thank you.

842
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:42,370
Mormons give 10% of their income.

843
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,570
So have you heard of our lord and savior, Jokey Bird?

844
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,450
Thank you for the super chat.

845
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:47,690
Thank you, thank you.

846
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,050
Oh my God.

847
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,210
Today is wild.

848
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:52,410
This is what it's like when I'm lazy today.

849
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:53,890
Um, Tia.

850
00:30:54,650 --> 00:31:03,870
I feel like today, because I feel so lazy and tired, usually, I have a slight filter on, but I definitely don't have any filters right now.

851
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:09,270
I'm going all in.

852
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:11,910
If I'm- it's too late.

853
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:15,950
Now that I know I'm definitely going somewhere, nothing can stop me now.

854
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,810
Nothing can stop me.

855
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:22,850
I already know where I'm going.

856
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:25,390
The best I can do is just keep digging.

857
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:30,250
You got lazy and condemned us all.

858
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,230
Yes!

859
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:37,930
You shall all be part of the problem.

860
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:40,410
Yes!

861
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:42,590
Yeah, thank you for the super chat.

862
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:42,950

Thank you.

864
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:44,550
Hi Doki.

00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:45,950
Thanks for coming to OtakuFest.

866
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:52,370
Just want to share that one of the Doki cosplayers in the meet-and-greet queue gave everyone a free Doki eye-print and affordable fans.

867
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,390
If you're here, thank you so much.

868
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:55,790
Oh my god, I received one of them too.

869
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:56,710

00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:01,550
I really- I was- it was really- I love doing them.

874
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:12,530
I love doing meet-and-greets and stuff because I like seeing like all the fan- fans coming together to celebrate like me for some reason even though like I'm literally sending all of us to hell, right?

875
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,450
Celebrating me right now.

876
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:24,290

Thank you.

882
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:33,410
I believe this is now the tomato church.

883
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:34,510
Thank you for the super chat.

884
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:34,910
Thank you.

885
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:35,610
Thank you.

886
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:38,970
The man, the stream took a very strange turn.

887
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,070
Thank you for the super chat.

888
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:40,390

Thank you.

890
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:44,050
I feel like- I think it's right.

891
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:46,250
I think like eventually I was heading there.

892
00:32:46,390 --> 00:33:03,170
I just- I was eventually gonna head here anyway, so I just sped up the process, you know, I just- It's the eye- yeah, the eye bags make it- wait, let me- let me like make sure it's more immersive.

893
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:03,870
Give me a sec.

894
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:05,110
Let me edit this real quick.

895
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:11,030
I'm gonna make it so that it feels more immersive and everything.

896
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:12,310
Okay, give me a sec.

897
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:13,870
I'm opening the file.

898
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:15,030
Oh my god.

899
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,970
My Photoshop is so slow right now.

900
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:19,890
All right, let me delete this real quick.

901
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:22,730
Okay, delete that.

902
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:23,650
Save.

903
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:26,590
Where is that file?

904
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:28,330
What is that file?

905
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:29,210
Was it a JPEG?

906
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,750
Is this a JPEG?

907
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:33,110
No, what is that file?

908
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:34,910
No, it is a JPEG.

909
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:37,170
Okay, all right.

910
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,770
Okay, all right, don't worry guys.

911
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:43,890
I'll make it even more immersive.

912
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:47,710
Wait, is that the right JPEG?

913
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:51,210
Whoops, it's the wrong one.

914
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:52,610
Give me a sec.

915
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:54,230
Quick export.

916
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:56,210
Whoop, I saved in the wrong area.

917
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:57,590
Quick export.

918
00:33:58,010 --> 00:33:59,210
I saved in my thumbnails.

919
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:00,590
Give me a sec.

920
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:02,970
There we go.

921
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:06,930
I feel like I kick-started something and it was a mistake.

922
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:07,930
I'm so sorry y'all.

923
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:10,650
Also, ten more for repentance.

924
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:13,330

Yeah, there we go.

928
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:18,450
Now, it's transparent.

929
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:24,810
Now it's transparent, guys.

930
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:26,410
It's even more immersive.

931
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,530
Thank you for the super chat.

932
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:31,430

00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:52,790
I found out there's a thing called plumbing competitions.

937
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:53,890
Did you guys know that?

938
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:56,830
I didn't realize plumbing competition.

939
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:58,650
There's a competition for everything.

940
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,770
So like there's like a tournament.

941
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:09,370
There's actually like a league for plumbers where they like basically compete on who's the best, like who's the fastest plumber.

942
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:10,990
Yeah, and I was like watching.

943
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:12,270
I was like, what the fuck?

944
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:18,250

945
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:20,090

00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,350
That's so interesting.

948
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:28,750
I watched a little bit of it.

949
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:32,550
Yeah, the 2023 National Plumbing Championship.

950
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:34,970

951
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:38,050

952
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:39,610
Oh my god.

953
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:45,310
Okay, let me uh, let's skip my, let me skip this ad real quick.

954
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,390
Oh my god, there's so many ads.

955
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:57,130
Sorry, they like, I don't know if you guys noticed, but like they like, um My favorite ad blocker got deleted.

956
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:02,050
That's okay, I didn't say it.

957
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:06,470
My favorite ad blocker got like deleted off of Chrome.

958
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:12,250
So if anyone who uses that might, uses that same ad blocker, it's gone now.

959
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:24,470
It's gone now, so like, I gotta, Which is good, cuz then you guys can give me more ad revenue, you know.

960
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:30,710
It's okay guys, that's alright.

961
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:35,010
I mean you, cuz you guys weren't using ad blockers on my stream, right guys?

962
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:38,250
And if you are, don't make me tap my repentance.

963
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,990
Don't make me tap the repentance side.

964
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:44,830
If you are, this is the perfect time to fucking repent right now.

965
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:51,330
If, if you were using an ad blocker on my stream, it's right here.

966
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:57,690
I would never.

967
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:01,170
Okay, alright, right in front of my channel?

968
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:02,130
Really?

969
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:12,220
Oh my god, I was like watching a little bit, it was actually pretty hardcore.

970
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:15,920
Honestly, always using premium.

971
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,780
It's pretty fucking hardcore.

972
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,340
I was like, damn, what the fuck?

973
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,180
Can't believe there's a competition for everything.

974
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:27,160
Christopher, thank you for your very first super chat.

975
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,920
Forgive me, Doki, for I have sinned.

976
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,020
It's been three months since I've last seen your stream.

977
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:41,180
I confess that I have cheated with other Vtubers and used ad blocker on, and your very first stream back is this?

978
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:46,500
Out of everything I streamed, this is your first stream coming back.

979
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,320
I'm literally, I'm not even talking about anything today.

980
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:55,260
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

981
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,100
Neppers, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

982
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,760
But I don't know what to do this week.

983
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:05,660
I have no like collabs, plan or anything.

984
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:11,800
I'm gonna like Friday, because I said I promised Adam that I'd like show up for his birthday.

985
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:24,400
I don't have like anything, like, actual plan for this week.

986
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:31,500
I've just been feeling incredibly, um, incredibly lazy this week.

987
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,040
The last two days, I've been feeling incredibly lazy.

988
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:42,820
Just cuz like, also there's some help that I've been like sick the last couple of weeks, so I've been getting better.

989
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:48,280
I don't have like, like my nose isn't stuffed up anymore, so I am getting a lot better now.

990
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,240
It's just my voice.

991
00:38:49,560 --> 00:39:02,840
My voice is still like, like a work in progress, but it is, it is sound, I do sound a lot of better now, but Griffin, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

992
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,560
Like, my voice sounds a lot better.

993
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,800
I mean, it still needs work.

994
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:10,500
It still definitely needs work, but like, I am recovering very slowly.

995
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:17,400
But I'm trying to figure out, like, I'm trying to figure out if I should go to the hospital anyway.

996
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:23,680
Um, just cuz like, just, just to be sure, just to get something to like, like fast.

997
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,820
Like, I don't know if it's just my voice anymore.

998
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:28,540
If I just need to make sure I don't talk as much the next week.

999
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:29,920
Also,

1000
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:35,270
I should.

1001
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:37,250
I'll think about it.

1002
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:41,530
I'll think about it.

1003
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:43,610
Most likely I might, I might.

1004
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:45,910
I was just, like I said, I literally was just sleeping.

1005
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:50,470
Um, I was just sleeping most of the time.

1006
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:54,350
Also, I have an idea for like, a future merch.

1007
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:58,030
Like, this popped up on my, this popped up on my Twitter.

1008
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:06,390
I did not, I should have known because like, I, you know, we have the My Melody version of this, but I saw this.

1009
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:11,540
I saw this, and I really, I really want to make...

1010
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:22,170
I want to, I saw Puchako, I saw Puchako boxers, and I was like, oh my god.

1011
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:27,210
I want to make, I want to make Dragoon.

1012
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:30,190
No, no, I do refuse.

1013
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:32,530
I will not be on the boxers, guys.

1014
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:39,650
But, I thought it would be funny to have, to have Dragoon boxers.

1015
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:41,270
Not, not me.

1016
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:43,730
I will, I will not be on those boxers.

1017
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:52,250
But, cuz like, okay, what I've noticed is that like, a lot of VTuber merch is like, very catered towards like, girls.

1018
00:40:52,730 --> 00:41:01,330
And I was like, oh my god, we should have boxers, like, to represent the guys, or like, girls who want to wear boxers, too.

1019
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:09,020
So, or, you know, I could have the tomato on, too.

1020
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:17,520
So, I thought, I thought it would be such a cool idea to have like, tomato, oh yeah, tomato, KuroKy, and Dragoon boxers in the future.

1021
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,700
So, I like, thought about it, too.

1022
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:25,800
Definitely is something in the future that I'm gonna do, where you, see guys, I know what you guys really want.

1023
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:31,260
I know, I know what you guys really want.

1024
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:38,560
The VTuber, the VTuber boxers, I'm here to represent.

1025
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:46,810
I'm sorry to all the brief users out there.

I'm not here to represent you.

1029
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:01,250

00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:44,690
But for those who are in the member stream, you sort of know why.

1096
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:46,790
Like, everything was put on a hold.

1097
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:48,230
Uh, for everything.

1098
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:50,550
So like, you guys sort of know why.

1099
00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:54,610
Like, everything was sort of like all over the place.

1100
00:47:54,890 --> 00:47:56,570
Um, if you're there for the member stream.

1101
00:47:56,570 --> 00:47:57,890
But, anyway.

1102
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:05,230
Um, I think like a couple days ago, we are finishing the setup for it.

1103
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:15,190
I'm just waiting on the team behind the server to like finish setting up their end.

1104
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:21,770
So like, I have everything set up on my end for the Discord server for the Minecraft server to do the whitelist stuff.

1105
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:25,650
But like, I'm just waiting on them to finish setting everything up now.

1106
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:28,670
So, um, I finished all my part of the thing.

1107
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:31,070
Um, because a couple days ago, I was free for a bit.

1108
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:31,850
This was before the tournament.

1109
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:32,290
I was free.

1110
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:33,170
I had free time.

1111
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:36,950
And also, like, my manager was like, God, get through your to-do list.

1112
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:38,970
And then like, cause I felt a lot better.

1113
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:40,550
I wasn't like as sick that day.

1114
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:41,910
So I went through my to-do list.

1115
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:45,030
So I just did the things I had to do to finish my side of setting it up.

1116
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:46,350
So now I'm just waiting on them.

1117
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:51,450
Um, I'm just waiting on them to finish their end.

1118
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:55,030
Finishing the setup for the Discord server and everything.

1119
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:57,530
So, um, I don't know when exactly it'll be.

1120
00:48:57,730 --> 00:49:03,710
Cause I could message them again today and they'd be like, Oh, guys, when will I, when?

1121
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:07,910
Cause like, we have the server all, all like, finalized.

1122
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:10,850
Regarding like, my side of setting it up for the Discord server.

1123
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:11,910
So I'm just waiting on them.

1124
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:15,930
Um, um, and everything.

1125
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:24,580
Um, no, we're keeping the Minecraft server, but we will update it.

1126
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:29,740
We're gonna update it, but only when your newly explored areas will have the newer Minecraft stuff.

1127
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,940
Um, cause I know like, there's new Minecraft stuff now.

1128
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:37,720
Anyway, you know what I realized?

1129
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,040
There's a lot of Sanrio boxers.

1130
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:43,100
Like, surprisingly, I was not expecting that.

1131
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:53,540
Like, I, there's like, I don't know why, but there's a huge market for like, official Sanrio boxers.

1132
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:58,760
Which was very surprising to me, because you know, Sanrio is like, the ladies, oh, that is true.

1133
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:00,400
But like, I don't know.

1134
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:09,700
Cause Sanrio, you know, Sanrio is like, more catered towards like, like, women, you know?

1135
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:13,080
Um, men can be, that's true, men can be cute too.

1136
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:19,300
But like, I, I just thought it was like, really funny.

1137
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:23,500
You know, like, you wear this on your first date.

1138
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,500
What if you wear this on your first date, guys?

1139
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,220
Would you wear this on your first date?

1140
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:33,900
Would you, would you wear this on your first date?

1141
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,700
You're right, you're right, you're right.

1142
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:42,560
Twinks do, do exist.

1143
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:43,700
You're right.

1144
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:51,380
She's not seeing it anyway, so, but what if she will?

1145
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:52,740
She'll like it.

1146
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:54,680
No, you're right, you're right, she'll enjoy it.

1147
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:58,220
She'll be like, oh my god, he's the one, you should always wear this up.

1148
00:50:58,460 --> 00:50:59,400
You're right, guys.

1149
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:00,460
Who am I kidding?

1150
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:04,740
You should always wear this on your first date.

1151
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:10,300
Cause if it, if you're about to hit a home run, she would appreciate this.

1152
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:16,380
This is like flirting, um, how to riz with Doki.

1153
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,300
As a woman.

1154
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:23,500
Here's my cheat code for you men out there, and women too.

1155
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,460
Wear this on your first date.

1156
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:39,060
Because, if you do make it, and then, you know, you're about to, you know, you take off your pants, and she sees this.

1157
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:42,460
Or he sees this, you're in, you're so in.

1158
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:46,160
And if it doesn't work, it only works one out of five times.

1159
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:49,780
So I'm, I mean, four out of, it only works four out of five times.

1160
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:54,180
So I'm really sorry, you were just the one person that didn't work with, you know.

1161
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:58,060
Probability wise, you just weren't that, you just hit the unlucky street.

1162
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:00,240
But four out of five times it works, guys.

1163
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,340
You were just the fifth guy that didn't work.

1164
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,880
No, no, no, no.

1165
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:10,940
You were all just the fifth guy where it doesn't work.

1166
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:13,760
It's like the naked man in How I Met Your Mother.

1167
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,480
It works four out of five times.

1168
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,940
Because you're just the fifth person where it doesn't work.

1169
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:20,960
You lost the pity, exactly.

1170
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:26,870
Um, Yabby, thank you for the super chat.

1171
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:27,910
Thank you, thank you.

1172
00:52:28,990 --> 00:52:31,510
Doki, you can't even play HuniePop, not taking Risley.

1173
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:32,750
Okay, that's different!

1174
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:34,470
That's anime women!

1175
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:38,050
That's different!

1176
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:39,090
Alright?

1177
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:40,950
That's anime women.

1178
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:43,250
My advice works for fleshies, okay?

1179
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:50,750
I don't have good wrists for 2D, but I have really good wrists for 3D, so...

1180
00:52:55,470 --> 00:52:56,950
Like, did you see her?

1181
00:52:57,450 --> 00:52:58,910
Did you see the proportions?

1182
00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:00,310
Look.

1183
00:53:04,410 --> 00:53:05,390
You are...

1184
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:05,930
That's why!

1185
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:07,270
You're only good at...

1186
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:08,610
Okay, I don't even know this.

1187
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:14,650
The people who are not part of the same dimensions tend to be good...

1188
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:15,250
Like, okay.

1189
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:16,370
So it's like...

1190
00:53:16,370 --> 00:53:17,670
Okay, here's how...

1191
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:18,590
This is like the metaphor.

1192
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:19,730
This is like comparison.

1193
00:53:20,290 --> 00:53:22,070
Like, you trust vets, right?

1194
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:23,170
You trust vets.

1195
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:24,590
But they're not animals.

1196
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:26,050
They're not dogs.

1197
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:28,530
But you trust a vet with your dog's life.

1198
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:35,110
Why the fuck would you trust a human person being for your dog's life when they're not even a dog themselves?

1199
00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:36,650
They don't know what they're saying.

1200
00:53:36,830 --> 00:53:38,490
How do you know what they're doing is right?

1201
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:39,770
But you trust them.

1202
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:40,410
There.

1203
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:42,130
You trust them, right?

1204
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:43,390
So it's just like me.

1205
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:49,550
I might be an anime woman, but like, you should be able to trust me to give you advice regarding fleshies.

1206
00:53:50,450 --> 00:53:54,130
I might not be fleshy, but I can still give good advice.

1207
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:01,090
They're trained by other people.

1208
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:03,170
By other people.

1209
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:05,010
They're being trained by other people.

1210
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:07,070
They're not being trained by another fucking dog.

1211
00:54:07,430 --> 00:54:09,370
They're not being trained by a fucking cat.

1212
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:11,350
They're trained by other people.

1213
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:14,730
So like, how do you know what they say is correct?

1214
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:15,890
Exactly.

1215
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:22,790
Where's your fleshy license?

1216
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:30,390
And the gold medal in mental gymnastics goes to Toe Keeper.

1217
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:32,870
Thank you for the magenta suit, bud.

1218
00:54:32,990 --> 00:54:34,350
Thank you, thank you.

1219
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,940
Doctors have actual research experience.

1220
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:42,900
Yeah, for human beings.

1221
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:45,800
How do you know the vet knows what they're doing?

1222
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,200
They're trained by other people.

1223
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:49,740
It's not like...

1224
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:54,300
It's like...

1225
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,420
But you still trust them.

1226
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,560
You still trust them.

1227
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:00,980
They're served by humans.

1228
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:01,920
They're served...

1229
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,600
It's not like the dog fucking gave that person a diploma.

1230
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,040
Be like, great job.

1231
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:08,160
You know exactly what's going on inside me.

1232
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:09,460
We don't know that.

1233
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:14,520
See, look at that.

1234
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:15,720
Checkmate, guys.

1235
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:16,760
Get lawyered.

1236
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:21,720
Wings, thank you for the super chat.

1237
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:23,040
Thank you, thank you.

1238
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:28,940
I might be a vegan, but I know my meat's hot turkey right now.

1239
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:30,520
Thank you for the super chat.

1240
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:32,380
Thank you, thank you.

1241
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:34,460
There you go.

1242
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:36,980
Exactly.

1243
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:37,960
I know.

1244
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:40,860
You don't know that.

1245
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,440
Have you asked that?

1246
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:44,460
Show us your diploma.

1247
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:46,740
Show us your diploma.

1248
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:48,960
Diplomas are fake.

1249
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:53,020
They're fake news.

1250
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,100
Anyone can buy a diploma.

1251
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:01,060
I'm here for real life experiences, guys.

1252
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,600
I'm here to provide life experiences.

1253
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:05,940
From what I experience.

1254
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,300
Thank you for the super chat.

1255
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:12,320
Thank you, thank you.

1256
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:16,220
If the Hello Kitty boxers didn't work, she wasn't the right...

1257
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:17,040
Exactly.

1258
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:18,960
That's what I'm saying.

1259
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:22,460
She just wasn't the right one.

1260
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:26,980
Didn't you go to college?

1261
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:28,000
Exactly.

1262
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:30,760
And now I'm here being an anime girl.

1263
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:34,220
Fucking giving you life advice.

1264
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,440
You think my diploma meant anything?

1265
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:38,540
That you're just proving my point.

1266
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,680
You're fucking proving my point.

1267
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:42,360
What I do for a living...

1268
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:44,380
Is...

1269
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:47,360
I did not need to go to school for.

1270
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:50,360
All I needed was Twitter.

1271
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,420
To do what I do.

1272
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:55,100
Which is a little sad.

1273
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:56,940
I get my news updates on Twitter.

1274
00:57:00,810 --> 00:57:02,550
Is there actually boxer briefs?

1275
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:03,450
Wait, are these boxers?

1276
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:05,130
I don't know my boxers and briefs.

1277
00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:06,730
Okay, boxers.

1278
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:10,710
What the fuck is the difference between boxers and boxer briefs?

1279
00:57:10,810 --> 00:57:11,510
Oh, okay.

1280
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:14,410
I guess I'll do boxer briefs and boxers then.

1281
00:57:14,650 --> 00:57:15,690
But no briefs.

1282
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:17,110
No briefs.

1283
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:19,690
Just boxers and boxer briefs.

1284
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:20,890
Bro, you think I know?

1285
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:22,450
Bro!

1286
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:26,070
You think I fucking know the difference between boxers and...

1287
00:57:26,070 --> 00:57:28,890
What if this guy was just wearing a really small boxers?

1288
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:30,170
You guys don't know that?

1289
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:36,440
Okay, this is gonna be my...

1290
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:37,200
Alright, guys.

1291
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:37,840
Would it be...

1292
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,020
Okay, guys, let me draw this.

1293
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:41,520
Would it be fucked up if I make this my boxer...

1294
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:42,740
Okay, I'm gonna...

1295
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:44,900
I want one of them to be boxer briefs.

1296
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:48,860
But would it be fucked up if I made this one of my boxer brief designs?

1297
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:53,200
Where it's like...

1298
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:58,580
So cute.

1299
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,060
Why are you laughing?

1300
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:01,420
I'm not laughing.

1301
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:01,960
I'm just...

1302
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:04,900
I'm just trying to figure out what the design will be.

1303
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:08,260
And I have a really good idea on what I want my design to be.

1304
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:09,480
Okay, so...

1305
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:10,900
Wait, how do I...

1306
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:12,780
Boost up the...

1307
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:15,080
Okay, how do I make the...

1308
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:16,200
Oh, here's the paint size.

1309
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:16,980
There we go.

1310
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:18,540
Okay, so that...

1311
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:19,960
It's gonna look like this.

1312
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:22,900
So, like, this is like where...

1313
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:25,100
You guys will know.

1314
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:26,900
This is exactly where the...

1315
00:58:31,310 --> 00:58:32,110
Okay, so...

1316
00:58:32,110 --> 00:58:33,270
This is gonna be the design.

1317
00:58:34,130 --> 00:58:35,670
So, the mouth is...

1318
00:58:40,910 --> 00:58:41,470
So...

1319
00:58:41,470 --> 00:58:44,050
So you guys will know where the mouth is gonna be.

1320
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:46,470
But like, you know...

1321
00:58:46,470 --> 00:58:48,050
You got a lady over...

1322
00:58:48,050 --> 00:58:49,770
And then you show them this.

1323
00:58:55,650 --> 00:58:57,550
You got a lady over...

1324
00:58:57,550 --> 00:58:59,770
And then the mouth is where...

1325
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:00,630
The fun is.

1326
00:59:04,530 --> 00:59:05,870
That's the best.

1327
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:12,670
There ain't no way.

1328
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:14,790
It's kinda too...

1329
00:59:14,790 --> 00:59:16,570
You need to be stopped.

1330
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:22,510
So it'll be the...

1331
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:24,170
It'll be the tomato...

1332
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:26,590
It'll be the tomato boxer briefs.

1333
00:59:26,910 --> 00:59:29,110
So, I think if I'm gonna make boxer briefs...

1334
00:59:29,110 --> 00:59:30,410
It's gonna be the tomato one.

1335
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:31,530
And...

1336
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:31,790
No, don't.

1337
00:59:31,790 --> 00:59:35,130
No, don't.

1338
00:59:35,430 --> 00:59:36,650
Please, don't.

1339
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:39,730
Oh, my God.

1340
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:53,960
I just realized what I meant by that.

1341
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:55,300
I just...

1342
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,720
I just realized.

1343
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:58,600
Oh, my God.

1344
00:59:58,880 --> 00:59:59,180
Okay.

1345
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:01,800
Okay.

1346
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:02,340
Okay, but...

1347
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:04,200
I'm not backing down, though.

1348
01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:05,120
I'm...

1349
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:10,420
Now I just need to release.

1350
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:11,040
Okay, you're right.

1351
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:12,000
It should be a little high.

1352
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:12,920
You're right, guys.

1353
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:16,560
The mouth should be...

1354
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:21,180
You're right.

1355
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:23,320
I'll put it right here.

1356
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:26,940
It would look better if the mouth was like...

1357
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:28,300
It would look better position-wise.

1358
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:29,100
Is that better?

1359
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:34,140
Position-wise.

1360
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:35,000
You're right.

1361
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:36,500
The mouth should be a little higher.

1362
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:41,600
How would you resist?

1363
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:45,020
Thank you for the super chat wings.

1364
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:47,160
Thank you, thank you.

1365
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:48,200
There we go.

1366
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:49,680
There we go.

1367
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:51,260
This is my next merch idea.

1368
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:54,180
I wanna make it so that...

1369
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:56,360
The design is hilarious.

1370
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:58,280
I'll buy it.

1371
01:00:58,340 --> 01:01:00,380
So it'll be the tomato.

1372
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:01,960
Okay, so let me...

1373
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:03,340
Let me color it, too.

1374
01:01:04,780 --> 01:01:05,260
Guys...

1375
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:07,400
Oh, my God.

1376
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:10,680
Let me color it, too.

1377
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:11,680
Guys, you're right.

1378
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:12,860
I should color it.

1379
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:14,580
So you guys can be more immersed.

1380
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:17,220
Alright, so...

1381
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:20,200
So it'll be red, as you guys all know.

1382
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:21,240
It'll be red.

1383
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:22,440
So it'll be like this.

1384
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:25,140
And then I'm gonna make sure to color this part green.

1385
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:27,000
And then everything else would be...

1386
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,500
Alright, so this is how...

1387
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:30,960
How the boxers would look like.

1388
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:31,700
Right here.

1389
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:33,740
We colorize it.

1390
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:34,320
There we go.

1391
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:36,320
I think it's perfect!

1392
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:39,500
I'm not even kidding.

1393
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:41,820
And it doesn't even look like VTuber merch.

1394
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:43,620
It just looks like...

1395
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:47,500
It doesn't even look like VTuber merch at all.

1396
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:48,600
It's just...

1397
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:51,280
Anybody can wear it.

1398
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:52,960
I'll make it in all sizes.

1399
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:54,020
For everyone.

1400
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:57,180
It's beautiful.

1401
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:59,140
Full Technicolor.

1402
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:02,060
I don't... What do you mean you don't like this anymore?

1403
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:04,980
This is like a million dollar merch idea.

1404
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:10,100
It's like...

1405
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:12,960
I swear, if I propose this at Shark Tank...

1406
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,440
I'd get all the funding, guys.

1407
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:16,940
This is a Shark Tank product.

1408
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:18,300
100%.

1409
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:24,160
My wife will be getting a nice surprise on our next date night.

1410
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:26,180
Jason, thank you for the superchat.

1411
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:27,320
Thank you.

1412
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:28,500
Hey, baby.

1413
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:31,520
I want to see my Doki Bird collection.

1414
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:36,440
No, you'd be like...

1415
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:39,160
Oh my god.

1416
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:40,880
You'd be like, hey, babe.

1417
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:44,220
I just got a new Doki Bird package.

1418
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:51,000
You want to check the package out?

1419
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:55,040
No!

1420
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:00,280
It's just the wrist.

1421
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:05,860
What do you mean?

1422
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:08,460
A million dollar idea right here.

1423
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,280
Zero, thank you for the superchat.

1424
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:13,160
Thank you, thank you.

1425
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:16,000
Send the screenshot to my boyfriend and prove this.

1426
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:19,640
Tomato boxes for date is a go.

1427
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:22,880
Buttass who has two faces.

1428
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:23,920
Please.

1429
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:26,680
Fireball, thank you for the superchat.

1430
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,020
Thank you, thank you.

1431
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:29,680
Hello, Spencer.

1432
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:31,020
Thank you for the superchat.

1433
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:32,180
Thank you, thank you.

1434
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:33,940
This is the front, by the way.

1435
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:36,680
By the way, guys, this is the front design.

1436
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,680
By the way.

1437
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:40,260
This is...

1438
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:44,560
This is not the back design of the boxer briefs.

1439
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:47,640
This is absolutely the front design.

1440
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:54,860
That's why...

1441
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:59,300
That's why I have to move the mouth somewhere.

1442
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:02,160
What's the back?

1443
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:03,540
Oh, that's a good question.

1444
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:05,020
I don't know what to put on the back.

1445
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:11,000
I don't know.

1446
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:11,420
You're right.

1447
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:13,440
I don't know.

1448
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,300
What do I put on the back of it?

1449
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:15,980
I don't know.

1450
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:16,980
Maybe I should just...

1451
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:18,000
Should I just put, like...

1452
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,820
Oh, I should put, like, a tomato...

1453
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:22,040
A fake butt.

1454
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:24,300
X marks the spot.

1455
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:26,780
There's an X on the tomato?

1456
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:28,720
The bottom.

1457
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:30,260
Oh, man.

1458
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:31,360
I'll figure that out later.

1459
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:32,420
I just know what...

1460
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:33,600
You see, this is, like...

1461
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:36,680
This is exactly why I have my repentance...

1462
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:38,200
Pan here.

1463
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:41,320
This is exactly why... On Ash Wednesday, too.

1464
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:47,360
Ash Wednesday.

1465
01:04:49,220 --> 01:04:50,900
The perfect day to repent.

1466
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:56,280
Alright.

1467
01:04:57,140 --> 01:04:57,900
Thank you, guys.

1468
01:04:57,980 --> 01:05:00,500
I'm glad, like, you all think it's a really good idea.

1469
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:04,680
I was thinking about a new merch idea and I'm definitely gonna...

1470
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:06,560
I'm definitely gonna do something like that.

1471
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:08,000
I was thinking about it, too.

1472
01:05:08,180 --> 01:05:09,740
I was like, man, I really...

1473
01:05:11,060 --> 01:05:11,420
Anything.

1474
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:16,680
I want... Just, like...

1475
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:21,160
The back is an exit sign.

1476
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:22,800
Mori, thank you for the super chat.

1477
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:23,760
Thank you, thank you.

1478
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:28,240
Um... I just thought it was a really neat idea, you know?

1479
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:32,980
Cause, like, I owned my Melody Boxer briefs and I was like, oh, man, I wanna make something similar.

1480
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:36,240
But, like, I wanted the face to be the front instead of the back.

1481
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:38,300
Cause, like...

1482
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:39,740
Cause you know why.

1483
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:46,740
You know why.

1484
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:53,400
John, thank you for the super chat.

1485
01:05:53,540 --> 01:05:54,760
Thank you, thank you.

1486
01:05:57,180 --> 01:05:58,560
Kaz, thank you for the super chat.

1487
01:05:58,660 --> 01:05:59,460
Thank you, thank you.

1488
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,900
I showed you my Toki boat.

1489
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:04,780
Please, please respond.

1490
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:06,440
Thank you for the super chat.

1491
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:07,380
Thank you, thank you.

1492
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:08,380
Why do I see it?

1493
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:09,700
Oh, this is my inspiration.

1494
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:13,820
This is my inspiration for, like, new merch ideas.

1495
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:15,520
Um... Yeah, I know!

1496
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:17,100
These boxes look so sick.

1497
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:18,980
Thank you, Hello Kitty.

1498
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:20,900
Um...

1499
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:22,200
Kongo, thank you for the super chat.

1500
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:31,880
I'm all here up, uh, experimenting, you know?

1501
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:32,780
I'm an entrepreneur.

1502
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:35,180
I'm a fucking entrepreneur.

1503
01:06:35,380 --> 01:06:36,200
What can I say?

1504
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:38,280
I have great ideas.

1505
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:40,160
Um, thank you for the super chat.

1506
01:06:40,220 --> 01:06:41,580
Thank you, thank you.

1507
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:45,040
Um, yeah.

1508
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:47,680
I'm not okay.

1509
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:52,880
I'm not okay, guys.

1510
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:57,140
Uh, Scrooge, thank you for the super chat.

1511
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:57,980
Thank you, thank you.

1512
01:06:58,260 --> 01:07:00,280
The back just has a little X for the butt.

1513
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:02,180
Oh, it's like Pompompurin.

1514
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:07,040
Where, like, his butthole, his bootyhole is just like a little X on it.

1515
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:07,780
Oh my god.

1516
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:09,420
I mean, it could be, yeah.

1517
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:10,540
See, look at that.

1518
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:11,540
There's no bad ideas.

1519
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:13,120
Just...

1520
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:17,600
Just ideas that haven't yet been discovered, guys.

1521
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:19,880
Like I said, there's no bad ideas, everybody.

1522
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:20,740
Okay?

1523
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:28,480
Can we also get a Doge or Penis Bowl merch to send to our local churches?

1524
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:30,340
Thank you for the super chat.

1525
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:31,440
Thank you, thank you.

1526
01:07:32,020 --> 01:07:32,740
Um, yeah.

1527
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:37,220
Ah, I'm so tired.

1528
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:41,180
I'm glad I was able to hang out with you guys, though.

1529
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:48,460
I really wanted to just, like, chill today and just talk to you guys and everything.

1530
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:50,440
Um, yeah.

1531
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:52,320
I just feel really lazy.

1532
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:53,660
I feel really lazy.

1533
01:07:53,780 --> 01:07:54,640
I didn't want to, like...

1534
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:56,540
I didn't want to scream or yell today.

1535
01:07:56,540 --> 01:07:58,780
Cause, like, that's usually what happens when I'm gaming.

1536
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:03,840
So I just wanted to, like, take it easy and, um, hang out with all of you guys.

1537
01:08:04,220 --> 01:08:05,780
What's your plans for tomorrow's stream?

1538
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:06,480
I don't know.

1539
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:07,380
I don't know.

1540
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,280
Most likely a gaming stream tomorrow.

1541
01:08:09,860 --> 01:08:14,060
Um, I'll do, like, a game that's, like... I'll do something like a one-off, maybe, tomorrow.

1542
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:16,440
Like, usually at 5pm or something.

1543
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:20,460
Um, but I'll do something one-off tomorrow.

1544
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:22,000
If not, maybe I'll...

1545
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,700
No, I'll just do, like, an actual stream.

1546
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:26,320
Uh, so...

1547
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:27,800
Maybe I'll do the digging holes one.

1548
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:34,660
Yeah, I haven't done the hole dig yet, but I was thinking about the digging one, but then I was like, uh, is this gonna be a chatting stream?

1549
01:08:34,780 --> 01:08:35,320
Most likely.

1550
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:36,700
So I wanna do something else.

1551
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:37,640
I wanna play something.

1552
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:38,760
I wanna play a game.

1553
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:41,220
There was, like, one where you could make a museum.

1554
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:44,060
There's, like, a museum game.

1555
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:44,620
Oh!

1556
01:08:44,860 --> 01:08:50,220
I saw someone link me, like, how to play Battle for Middle Earth, like, on PC.

1557
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:53,580
Cause there's, like, modders that, like, made, like, the RTS.

1558
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:55,720
Like, I'd be down to play that, too.

1559
01:08:55,780 --> 01:08:57,820
Cause it's, like, one of my favorite RTS games.

1560
01:08:58,100 --> 01:08:59,560
So, let's... I'll just see how...

1561
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:00,860
I'll see if I can figure it out.

1562
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:02,700
I'll see if I can figure it out.

1563
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:08,060
Um, and, like, figure out if I can actually... if I can actually get it working.

1564
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:09,860
Cause if I can, maybe I'll do that tomorrow.

1565
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:13,980
Cause I really wanna... I've been craving to play Battle for Middle Earth for a long time.

1566
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:15,280
So, yeah.

1567
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:15,960
We'll see.

1568
01:09:16,180 --> 01:09:17,100
We'll see how it goes.

1569
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:20,540
Uh...

1570
01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:22,640
Uh, but yeah, I have no ideas yet.

1571
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:24,920
Literally, I've just been, like, incredibly lazy.

1572
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:26,960
I've been so fucking lazy.

1573
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:31,320
So, I have, like, zero plans on my week.

1574
01:09:31,860 --> 01:09:32,260
I...

1575
01:09:32,260 --> 01:09:35,320
Most of the time, I've just been, like, like I said, just doing nothing.

1576
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:39,060
Which is bad, because I should be productive, cause I have a lot of stuff to do.

1577
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:40,540
But, like, um...

1578
01:09:41,860 --> 01:09:42,260
Um...

1579
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:45,840
But, like, I have an excuse just because of the Marble Rivals tournament I had earlier.

1580
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:46,880
And I won first place!

1581
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:48,540
So, I was, like, I'm treating myself.

1582
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:50,200
I'm treating myself to, like, chill.

1583
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:53,080
Uh...

1584
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:55,640
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1585
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:56,240
...

1586
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:00,750
...

1587
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:02,280
...

1588
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:03,580
...

1589
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:05,880
...

1590
01:10:06,490 --> 01:10:06,820
...

1591
01:10:06,820 --> 01:10:06,840
...

1592
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:07,820
...

1593
01:10:14,180 --> 01:10:14,840
...

1594
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:15,000
...

1595
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:16,360
...

1596
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:20,600
...

1597
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:21,400
...

1598
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:23,380
...

1599
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:25,740
...

1600
01:10:25,740 --> 01:10:25,760
...

1601
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,880
Alright, guys, I did say today was gonna be a short stream.

1602
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:32,660
Um, so, I am gonna chill now.

1603
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:34,240
I'm gonna chill now.

1604
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:37,880
I had a great time hanging out with all of you guys.

1605
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:39,160
Oh, it's your birthday, too?

1606
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:41,160
Let's do a birthday song before we go.

1607
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:42,400
Another birthday song.

1608
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:44,120
Madelyn, thank you for the superchat.

1609
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:44,900
Thank you, thank you.

1610
01:10:45,060 --> 01:10:46,520
Happy birthday to you.

1611
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:48,180
Happy birthday to you.

1612
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:50,060
Happy birthday, dear Vaseline.

1613
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:51,620
Happy birthday to you.

1614
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:52,940
Yeah, happy birthday!

1615
01:10:55,900 --> 01:10:58,140
So, I'm sorry this was a really short stream.

1616
01:10:58,540 --> 01:11:00,780
I just wanted... like I said...

1617
01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:05,440
I'm feeling like... I'm feeling like particularly eepy and lazy.

1618
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:08,040
But I had a great time talking with all my Dragons.

1619
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:10,180
I always have a great time hanging out with you guys.

1620
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:13,340
And I think like, I've sinned enough today.

1621
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,540
Today, I have sinned enough.

1622
01:11:19,980 --> 01:11:26,320
So I feel like it might be a good time to call it before I dig myself a deeper hole.

1623
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,140
But anyway guys, it was great to hang out.

1624
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:35,240
I hope you guys enjoyed...

1625
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:39,260
Um... enjoyed the, um...

1626
01:11:39,260 --> 01:11:40,740
The gorilla stream today.

1627
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:44,600
As always, everybody, stay hydrated.

1628
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:45,800
Posture check.

1629
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:48,520
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

1630
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:50,880
And if you, except for me...

1631
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,640
Head to bed, cause you deserve it.

1632
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:55,680
I'll most likely...

1633
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:57,620
Post a schedule later tonight.

1634
01:11:57,900 --> 01:11:58,860
I'll finish it up.

1635
01:11:59,540 --> 01:12:01,000
Somehow... I will finish it up.

1636
01:12:01,060 --> 01:12:01,280
I will.

1637
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:04,680
I'll post a schedule later tonight to figure out what exactly I want to do.

1638
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:07,640
Anyway, I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

1639
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:09,160
Bye guys!

1640
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:10,000
Bye!
