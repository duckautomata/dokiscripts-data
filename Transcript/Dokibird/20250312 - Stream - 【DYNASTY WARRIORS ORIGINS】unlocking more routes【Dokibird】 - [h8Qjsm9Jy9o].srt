1
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:48,860
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,140
Hello, hello!

3
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,320
Oh my god, okay, I was so ready to start.

4
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,060
Guys, I swear to god, I was so ready to start on time.

5
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:03,460
And then literally, my phone died because I forgot to plug in my phone to my charger.

6
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:07,020
And then I was like, oh shit, so I had to wait for it to turn back on.

7
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,740
And then when the moment turned back on, I was like, I'm so ready.

8
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,520
And then I got a phone call.

9
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,760
And I was like, who's calling me?

10
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,440
Who the fuck is calling me?

11
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,660
If I have a phone call, somebody must be dying.

12
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,120
Like, I swear to god, you only call me if I do not answer phone calls.

13
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,980
Unless someone is fucking dying.

14
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,320
So I was like, okay, who calls me?

15
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,420
Everyone just texts me.

16
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,080
And then I took the call, because I was like, you know what?

17
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,460
Today I'll feel nice today.

18
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,500
Usually I would leave it to voicemail.

19
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,440
Or voicemail, because I was like, if this was important, they would leave a voicemail.

20
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,360
Because then it would be telemarketers, you know?

21
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,140
I was like, it has to be telemarketers.

22
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,440
Because if it was important, they would leave a voicemail.

23
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,220
But today, I was like, you know what, Doki?

24
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,880
Your apartment is now clean, and I feel great today.

25
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:09,920
By the way, I slept, I went to bed at 8pm today.

26
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,020
I went to bed at like 8pm.

27
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:22,920
I woke up at 4 in the morning to put up my waiting room and post my tweet.

28
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,120
And that's why the waiting room came up at 4 in the morning.

29
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,500
Also, I had to, you know, walk dad.

30
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,960
Because I was like, oh fuck!

31
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,140
Usually he gets his walkies at like 2 or 3am.

32
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,320
And then I set an alarm, and I woke up at 4 in the morning.

33
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,660
But he didn't wake me up.

34
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,100
I think he was just like, I guess we just sleep.

35
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:50,860
Because when he sleeps, he goes full hibernation mode as well.

36
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,560
And then he's like, alright, guess I'll sleep as well.

37
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,460
Because he didn't wake me up either for walkies.

38
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,520
So then I woke up to give him his walkie.

39
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,700
I guess it's also daylight, oh you're right, daylight savings time.

40
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,940
It's technically 3 for him.

41
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:12,020
Like his body is like, oh you're right, I forgot about daylight savings.

42
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,160
Technically if daylight savings wasn't a thing, it would be 3 in the morning.

43
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,780
Also my bra broke, I just realized.

44
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:21,380
Sorry, TMI.

45
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,100
Okay, so for those who are men, who don't know.

46
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,280
At the bottom of the bra, it's a metal strap thing.

47
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,740
And like, this is an old one too, by the way.

48
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,840
This is TMI, I'm sorry.

49
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,180
But like, for education for the men out there about bras.

50
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,960
It's not sexy!

51
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,180
Because at the bottom, there's a thing called the underwire.

52
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,240
And like, it's an old bra.

53
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,560
So like, it's like several years old.

54
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,160
And so like, there's a metal thing.

55
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:59,640
So when it snaps, there's a fucking metal rod poking at me.

56
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,780
And it hurts.

57
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,420
And I was like, oh shit, did this break?

58
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,360
And then like, it hurts a lot.

59
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:10,220
So there's an underwire at the bottom, and it's metal.

60
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,300
And it pokes you and it can stab you.

61
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,560
So like...

62
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,980
So, what the fuck?

63
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,600
It's very uncomfortable.

64
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,530
Anyway, it's broken now.

65
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,620
So that means I'm trying to like, fucking...

66
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,580
Like, you know, I'm doing a lazy...

67
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,060
Like, have you ever...

68
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,620
For the women out there who does like...

69
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,100
Like, who used to do P.E.

70
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:39,700
and everything.

71
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:49,500
And like, you know how like, you're a bit embarrassed about like, taking your clothes off in the ladies changing room.

72
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,620
So you like, try to do it like, underneath your shirt.

73
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,100
And everything.

74
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,800
I'm doing that to take out...

75
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,340
I'm not taking my shirt off.

76
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,540
I'm just like, doing it inside.

77
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,100
It hurts.

78
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,400
Alright.

79
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:11,700
Very specific.

80
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,560
That's how I took off my bra.

81
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,680
Oh my god.

82
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,760
Ow, that actually hurt.

83
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,080
That thing was like, poking me.

84
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,860
Like, I don't know.

85
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,940
It just like, broke.

86
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,120
I think it broke when I was sleeping.

87
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,920
Sometimes I sleep with my bra...

88
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,120
Yes.

89
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,620
Apparently it's weird.

90
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,440
No, I think it...

91
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,160
I didn't notice it while I was setting up.

92
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,800
But then like, while I sat down on my PC.

93
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,380
While I sat down on my...

94
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,660
No, I'm not bleeding.

95
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,240
It's not...

96
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,380
It was...

97
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:42,580
Okay, so like, there are cases where the underwire can break through the fabric.

98
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,740
And then like, poke you and make it even hurt you more.

99
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,260
But it didn't break through the fabric.

100
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,020
It literally...

101
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,420
I think it literally like, just broke.

102
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,160
So like...

103
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,600
So like, it didn't break through the fabric yet.

104
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,000
But it was still very uncomfortable.

105
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,320
But anyway.

106
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,140
Yes.

107
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,180
Apparently it's weird to sleep with your bra on.

108
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,460
But I did that so much.

109
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,440
Like, I don't know why.

110
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,160
I just grew up doing that.

111
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,140
So it's just like...

112
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,160
Because I...

113
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,840
Okay, guys.

114
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,980
I have other women friends, guys.

115
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:13,780
I...

116
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,240
Guys.

117
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,740
So like, you know.

118
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,660
So like, you know.

119
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,480
I would be like, yeah, I sleep with my bra on.

120
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,980
And they're like, you sleep with your bra on?

121
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,400
And I was like, yeah, is that weird?

122
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,960
And apparently that's fucking weird.

123
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,940
And...

124
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,840
No way.

125
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,920
You're not just a bro.

126
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,220
Bros don't wear bra.

127
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,500
Well, some bros do, okay?

128
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,960
I'm sorry to tell you this.

129
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,920
But your bros are fucking women.

130
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,920
I'm sorry to break this news to you.

131
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,220
Yeah, so like...

132
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,980
So, they're sleeping bras?

133
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,360
Wait.

134
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,100
Okay, but I'm too lazy to have bras for separate occasions.

135
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,440
That's so weird.

136
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,440
Like, I just wear it.

137
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,080
And then we'll just go...

138
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,420
I think it's also because I'm just too lazy to take it off, I guess.

139
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,220
And then put it back on.

140
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,540
Like, that's like...

141
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,880
Look, my laziness transcends everything.

142
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:18,340
So it's like, why do I have to take it off when I can just leave it on for the next day?

143
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,400
Like, that's...

144
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,000
That's how my brain goes.

145
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,180
I was just like, why?

146
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,940
Like, why the fuck would I do that?

147
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,200
Because if I take it off, then I have to put it back on when I wake up.

148
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,100
So like, why the fuck would I do that?

149
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:35,400
I can just sleep with it on.

150
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,760
So it removes extra steps to my routine.

151
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:53,020
Anyway, but now I realize why people take it off.

152
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,980
Because it breaks very easily when you sleep with it on.

153
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,460
Invictus, thank you for the superchat.

154
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,500
Thank you, thank you.

155
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,980
Hi Doki, it's me again.

156
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,540
I love your Lord of the Rings stream as it's my favorite franchise.

157
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,220
Hopefully you will continue it.

158
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,080
Thank you for the superchat.

159
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,740
Thank you, thank you.

160
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,920
I might just go with...

161
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,980
If I do play, like, Lord of the Rings, the RTS game again.

162
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,120
I will play...

163
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,880
I might just go with the second game instead of continuing the first one.

164
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,400
Thank you for the superchat.

165
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,240
Thank you, thank you.

166
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,980
Dear, welcome to the tomato farm.

167
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,780
Welcome, welcome.

168
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,960
Cas, thank you for the superchat.

169
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,880
Thank you, thank you.

170
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,460
If the bros are wearing bras nowadays, then I gotta get one too for my bro.

171
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,140
Thank you for the superchat.

172
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,460
Thank you, thank you.

173
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,000
Nexy, Doki...

174
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,380
I changed clothes!

175
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:43,940
I'm just saying, if, like, if I take a shower in the morning, I'm gonna take it off then.

176
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,240
Or, like, later.

177
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,300
So, it's just convenient.

178
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,720
It's convenient, guys.

179
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,820
It's convenience, okay?

180
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:57,440
I'm just like, well, it means I was just, you know, I won't need to actually, like...

181
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,140
Guys, come on.

182
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,260
It's just basic convenience chat.

183
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,260
Nexy, thank you for the superchat.

184
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,400
Thank you, thank you.

185
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,360
Guys, guys, guys!

186
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:07,800
No!

187
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,200
I changed my clothes!

188
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,560
I literally just did laundry, chat.

189
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,340
I literally just did laundry.

190
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,840
Don't fucking do this to me.

191
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:15,440
Don't...

192
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,900
Don't do this to me.

193
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,160
I just did laundry, guys.

194
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,280
I put two pies in my laundry.

195
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,160
It was, uh, it was a lot of laundry.

196
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,380
I have to admit, it was.

197
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,600
But I have a lot of clothes.

198
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,280
It's because I have a lot of clothes, chat.

199
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:38,260
I have, like, a lot of clothes in my closet, okay?

200
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:42,160
So, I just put, whenever, like, you know, I was like, it's time to put this in.

201
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,580
Because I don't, I don't, technically, I don't have a laundry basket.

202
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:53,420
I just, like, if I have to, you know, if I have dirty laundry, I just stuff it in the, um, I just stuff it in the washer instead of putting it in a basket.

203
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:58,920
And then, at one point, when the washer starts getting, like, a little full, I be like, it's laundry time.

204
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,440
And then, I just do my laundry.

205
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:07,240
Hehehehehehe Oh, Wolfhound, shower clothes offer max convenience.

206
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,980
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

207
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,900
Um, Nexy, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

208
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,920
Couldn't just not wear one to sleep until after you shower, though?

209
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,320
Nexy, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

210
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,880
Well, you see, Nexy, sometimes, I wake up at 1220.

211
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,380
And then, I have to stream.

212
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:35,520
So, I can't do a morning shower, guys, because of that.

213
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:49,800
And then, sometimes, because I wake up at 1220, and then I have to stream, um, I, sometimes, I have to go out after my stream to walk Dad.

214
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:54,780
So, after I walk him, I do the shower.

215
00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:10,100
So, that's why I can't just, I can't just wake up and shower, because sometimes, I schedule a 1230 stream, and then the moment I wake up, it's streaming time.

216
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:18,940
Do not, and waking up earlier is not an option.

217
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,400
Um, normal size, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

218
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,140
Doki, when it rains, oh boy, I finally, I can do laundry.

219
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,560
Thank you for the super chat, normal size, thank you, thank you.

220
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,040
Doki, what do you mean I'm caretaker?

221
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,000
I have stream, I have a set schedule, chat.

222
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,900
I have, I have a set schedule.

223
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:48,780
Alright, anyway, so after I put my waiting room and everything, I obviously went to bed.

224
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:53,100
I went back to sleep, and I woke up at 1220, I was so fucking tired.

225
00:12:54,820 --> 00:13:02,040
Also, like, it's over for me, because, um, I started dreaming about Marvel Rivals games.

226
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,300
Like, I was in a ranked game, and I was like, it's over for me.

227
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,880
Like, there's, there's no cure for this brain rot anymore.

228
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,980
When you start dreaming about, about it, it's over.

229
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,740
There's no cure, guys.

230
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,640
Anyway, um, um, wait, what else?

231
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,480
Oh, yeah, cleaning, I forgot to talk to you about my cleaning lady story.

232
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:35,100
Uh, anyway, so, um, so, uh, because I didn't talk about it yesterday.

233
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:47,480
So, I realized how, how much the cleaning, the cleaning lady, because at first I was like, ooh, it's $200 Canadian, by the way.

234
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:52,160
I couldn't tell if $200 Canadian was expensive for cleaners.

235
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:57,780
Because, like I said, I've never had a cleaning lady come in and professionally clean my apartment before.

236
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,100
It was my first time hiring one.

237
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,860
So, I was like, I don't know if it's expensive or not.

238
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,140
Because, like, um, they charge, I couldn't tell.

239
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:12,560
And, um, so, because, uh, I, when I, when I was like, oh, man, how many people are coming?

240
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,020
And they're like, only one person is coming.

241
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:20,300
And, um, and so, like, when she came over, she was like, where do you want me to start?

242
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,840
And, obviously, I was like, the bathroom.

243
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:27,180
Because I felt like, you know, that's where all the fucked up shit happens in there.

244
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,520
Pun not intended.

245
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:33,400
But, that's where the biggest problems lies when it comes to cleaning.

246
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:40,640
And then, I was in my, I was just like, uh, also, um, dad did not like her.

247
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,900
Uh, because, like, I guess, because, like, usually, I guess he doesn't like her because she came.

248
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,560
I usually, uh, he likes women.

249
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,380
But, like, for some reason, he didn't like her.

250
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,840
And I think it's because you could tell she's afraid of him.

251
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,100
Um, because I was like, oh, I have a dog, is that okay?

252
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:57,740
And she's like, yeah.

253
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,540
And then, like, when she came in, he, like, came over.

254
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,600
And then, she, like, started, like, blocking him from her legs.

255
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:08,880
And then, that pissed him off because she, he was like, I wanna smell your legs.

256
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,900
And then, I was like, and then, and then, like, I think that, like, pissed him off.

257
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,820
Because he's like, why are you afraid of me?

258
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,600
Why won't you let me smell you?

259
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,140
So then, he started, like, barking at her.

260
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:25,540
And then, he was like, he was like, why?

261
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,440
Why won't you let me smell?

262
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,980
And then, so, like, why are you running?

263
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:49,400
So, so, like, um, so, like, I had to pick him up and, like, lock him in my bedroom.

264
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,460
Because, um, because he was being a little freak.

265
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,060
And so, so, and, like, obviously, he was, like, making her afraid and stuff.

266
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,080
So, I was like, I'm so sorry.

267
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,540
Like, he's usually, he usually really likes women.

268
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,220
So, like, I am sorry.

269
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:08,140
And I think he didn't like that she just, like, intruded on, like, his home and everything.

270
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:16,340
So, um, so, then, um, um, so, I was like, I'm so sorry.

271
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,820
Uh, he's usually really friendly.

272
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:26,920
And then, so, yeah, so, I had to lock, so, anyway, while I was, like, waiting in my bedroom so, like, he could be comfortable.

273
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,360
Um, obviously, he wasn't that comfortable because he's, like, what is she doing outside?

274
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,880
And why won't you let me smell her?

275
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:33,360
And,

276
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:43,120
um, look, I know it, okay, now that I think about it, that was a little rude for me to say.

277
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:46,240
But, like, I, I, I was, I was tired.

278
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,900
Okay, I was, like, tired and I was, like, panicking and I was, like, I don't know what to say.

279
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:54,380
And I was, like, I was surprised that he didn't like her.

280
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:58,660
Uh, but, also, he smelled, like, he knew she was afraid of him and he didn't like that.

281
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,360
And he was, like, why are you afraid of me?

282
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,780
I am a good boy.

283
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,280
I am a good boy to women.

284
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,500
Why are you afraid of me?

285
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:09,400
And he did not like that she was afraid of him because he's so used to, like, women liking him.

286
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,520
Um, anyway, anyway.

287
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,120
So, she spent an hour plus in the bathroom, just cleaning the bathroom.

288
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:24,600
And I was, like, um, I was, cause, like, she was booked for four hours.

289
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,700
And I was, like, oh, man, that's a long time cleaning the bathroom.

290
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:37,120
I'm, like, oh, oh, man.

291
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,020
No, it's a very small bathroom, guys.

292
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,620
It's, like, it's an apartment bedroom, a bathroom.

293
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:49,080
So, like, so that's why I was, like, man, for an apartment bathroom, an hour plus is a while.

294
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,940
But it's so clean now.

295
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,820
It's actually crazy how clean it is now.

296
00:17:54,200 --> 00:18:02,540
Um, and then, and after she was done in the bathroom, she was, like, wow, you have a lot of hair.

297
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,300
Because, because I told you guys, I grow hair really fast.

298
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,840
Like, my head grows hair really, really fast.

299
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:14,860
So, like, um, obviously I shed a lot when it comes to hair.

300
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:22,800
So, I shed a lot from when I, like, shower and brush my hair.

301
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,260
Like, she even, like, okay, it's so gross.

302
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:36,320
She even, like, um, she, like, basically, uh, because the floor was, like, there's lots of hair on the floor and everything, too.

303
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,960
So, uh, please, stop.

304
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:46,100
Um, and so, like, yeah, so, like, and, okay, here's the gross part.

305
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:54,700
She even, like, unclogged, it wasn't, technically it wasn't clogged, but for women out there, you know the problem.

306
00:18:54,700 --> 00:19:00,680
But sometimes, you know, like, the drain covers catches hair and stuff.

307
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,560
So, she even cleaned that.

308
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,500
And I was just like, oh, man.

309
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,040
It's true.

310
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:19,820
Yeah, yeah, so, like, you know, like, the, the thing, like, the thing where you, where you push down and then you can make a bath and stuff like that.

311
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,340
And then you put, you take it out.

312
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:29,920
And then for the women out there, when you take it out, when you take out that, that thing, the cover thing, and then you see the hair and you're like, oh, God.

313
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:37,400
And then you're like, let's pretend that doesn't exist anymore.

314
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,400
This is also, yes, but for women, we have very long hair.

315
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,960
It's a lot worse.

316
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,640
It's a, it's a lot worse for women.

317
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,740
Because we have a long hair.

318
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,100
It's hard to see it.

319
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:08,500
So, yeah, she even, and then, you know how, it's very funny because guys can, okay, that's true.

320
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,200
Guys can have long hair, too.

321
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,420
But, like, not a lot of you guys.

322
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,880
So, like, it's more common for women.

323
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,180
Anyway, so.

324
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,000
So, anyway.

325
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,060
Anyway.

326
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,360
So, anyway.

327
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:28,680
And then she, like, proved to me, like, I don't know why it was just proof that she's like, yeah, I did that.

328
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:33,220
Like, she, like, took the thing out so I could see that it was clean now.

329
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,440
You don't know me, Doki.

330
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:37,960
Yeah.

331
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,060
Bros can have long hair, too.

332
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,380
What the fuck?

333
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,440
Thank you for the super chat.

334
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,500
Thank you, thank you.

335
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:51,860
So, she took it out so I could see that it was really clean.

336
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,780
So, I was like, whoa, she even did that?

337
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,780
Anyway, it's crazy.

338
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,380
She did an amazing job.

339
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,600
Because she even cleaned my shoes.

340
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,300
I was very surprised.

341
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,100
She cleaned the bottom of my shoes.

342
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:10,400
Because I, like, went up to ask if she could do my office as well.

343
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:14,920
And I just see her, like, holding my shoes and cleaning it as well.

344
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,740
And I was like, oh my god.

345
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,740
She cleaned my shoes, too?

346
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,420
Oh my god, she can do everything.

347
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,880
Yeah, above and beyond.

348
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,620
I was like, what a...

349
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,800
$200 well spent.

350
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,880
That was actually so worth it.

351
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,210
I didn't have to pay extra at all.

352
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:37,150
That's crazy.

353
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,790
I didn't even have to pay extra.

354
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:39,950
You know what's even crazier?

355
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:43,310
I didn't even pay the next other 50%.

356
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,050
Because they haven't sent me the bill yet.

357
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:51,890
I just paid the first 50% before she came.

358
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,270
And then I messaged them.

359
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:54,570
I was like, alright, thanks.

360
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:55,250
That was great.

361
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,010
That was great.

362
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,170
When do I pay the next one?

363
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:01,110
And they still haven't sent me...

364
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:06,010
They haven't even sent me the other 50% bill.

365
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:08,270
Like, I can't even pay it.

366
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:09,670
And I was like...

367
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:14,670
I was like, okay, it's been like several days yet.

368
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:19,010
And I still haven't paid the other 50%.

369
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:22,210
I might text them back because I think they forgot about me.

370
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:27,050
But I'm definitely going to...

371
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:30,150
I'm definitely going to...

372
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:35,810
I'm definitely going to hire them monthly.

373
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:38,850
Because, like, wow, that was very convenient.

374
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:43,570
Like, it was honestly incredibly convenient how...

375
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:49,110
How great it felt right after she finished cleaning.

376
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:52,650
Because I was like, wow, I feel like a different person right after.

377
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:54,850
Like, I don't feel like I'm living in Filth anymore.

378
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,510
It wasn't that bad, guys.

379
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:59,850
Before the cleaner was here, it wasn't that bad.

380
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:03,550
But, like, still, it did feel really nice.

381
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:06,070
Like, the floors are clean and everything.

382
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:08,590
And, like, she did the dishes for free.

383
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:14,230
And, like, the bathroom has less hair in it.

384
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:20,970
It was not that bad, okay, guys?

385
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:22,810
It was not that bad.

386
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,130
But it felt nicer.

387
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,730
It did feel a lot nicer.

388
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:29,590
Mr. Sen, thank you for the Akasupa!

389
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:31,250
Thank you, thank you!

390
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:33,110
Because usually they charge...

391
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:35,130
Can you pass on the cleaner for a job well done?

392
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:35,970
Thank you again!

393
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:36,810
But usually...

394
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,710
Usually they said they charge extra for washing dishes.

395
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:41,890
But because she had time...

396
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:49,190
Because she had time, like, she was able to do the dishes for free as well.

397
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:50,950
So I was like, yippee!

398
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:54,910
I don't have to wash my own dishes!

399
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,110
Yay!

400
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:59,610
So, yeah, that makes me...

401
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:01,110
I was really happy about that.

402
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:04,850
Anyway, so today...

403
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:06,230
Okay, back to the...

404
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:08,310
Back to the game now.

405
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,130
Yoshi, thank you for the super chat!

406
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:12,210
Thank you, thank you!

407
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,890
Doki, is this game worth buying?

408
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:16,210
Also, are you gonna try the roguelike warriors game?

409
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:19,410
There's a roguelike warriors game?

410
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:20,510
Wait, what?

411
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:23,810
The roguelike...

412
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:27,070
My opinion on the game so far...

413
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:30,950
It's the best dynasty warriors game they made in the last...

414
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,050
15 plus years.

415
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:34,230
If I can...

416
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:35,830
Dynasty...

417
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,050
What was the last one?

418
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,810
Dynasty warriors...

419
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:40,430
9?

420
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,450
Was it 9 or 10?

421
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:43,370
I don't remember.

422
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:44,330
9.

423
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,290
Okay, 9.

424
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,190
9 was the last one.

425
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:47,810
And the last...

426
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:50,170
Uh...

427
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:51,310
Uh...

428
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:53,930
I think it's the best one so far.

429
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,110
In a lot...

430
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:55,910
Warriors Abyss.

431
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:57,670
Warriors Abyss?

432
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:58,790
The fuck is that?

433
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,170
When did this come out?

434
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:01,370
I never heard of it.

435
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:02,750
February 12th.

436
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:04,310
Oh, it came out last month?

437
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:06,170
I've never heard about it.

438
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:08,850
Um...

439
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:10,690
Is it fun?

440
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:13,070
That's 806...

441
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,450
It has a very pause...

442
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:16,170
I've never heard of this game.

443
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:17,470
Is it fun?

444
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:22,030
Abyss is really small but really fun.

445
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:25,190
I'm not a huge fan of the graphics so far.

446
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:27,110
I'm not gonna lie.

447
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:29,610
It's Dynasty Warriors...

448
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:30,950
What does SW mean?

449
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:32,710
It got Shadow Drop.

450
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:35,130
Yeah, I've never heard nothing about this game before.

451
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:37,150
Um...

452
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:37,810
But yeah, no.

453
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:39,850
The only issue I have...

454
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:43,870
The only issue I have regarding the Dynasty Warriors...

455
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:44,970
Oh, Samurai Warriors.

456
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:46,150
Oh, I've never played Samurai Warriors.

457
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,110
I've never played Samurai Warriors before.

458
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:48,410
Um, I...

459
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:50,470
The only, like, hack and slash...

460
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:56,450
The only hack and slash Warriors game I played was just literally Dynasty Warriors because of the three kingdoms.

461
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:59,910
Um, so I've never played, like, the other Warriors series before.

462
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:01,010
Not even the Zelda one.

463
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:03,790
Um...

464
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:05,670
Um...

465
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:06,730
Oh, that's a lot of...

466
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,410
I don't like the graphics though.

467
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,490
But I guess it's like a game where you don't care about the...

468
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:13,830
Like, you don't focus too much on the graphics and more on the gameplay.

469
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:14,990
The graphics...

470
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:15,630
Okay, let's see.

471
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:16,310
Initial thoughts.

472
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:17,990
Sadly, this seems the same.

473
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:19,970
It's not worth the price I've mentioned so far.

474
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:23,330
Phase 1 to 7 lasts about 10 seconds each!

475
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:24,750
HAHAHAHA!

476
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:26,930
HAHAHA!

477
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:28,910
Okay, that's funny.

478
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,030
HAHAHAHA!

479
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:33,990
Absolutely ridiculous game from SlappyButternut.

480
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:35,050
Um...

481
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:35,530
HAHAHA!

482
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:36,610
5 stars!

483
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:38,690
HAHAHAHAHA!

484
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:40,930
Um...

485
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:41,350
Also...

486
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,810
Okay, so this is a lot of fun for a good price.

487
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:45,490
If you're not a fan of Musou Warriors...

488
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:47,150
There are way better Hades-like updates.

489
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:47,930
Oh!

490
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:48,830
So it's like...

491
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:49,070
Oh!

492
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:50,530
So that's like...

493
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:51,790
It's basically like Hades.

494
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:53,630
But for Dynasty Warriors.

495
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:54,210
I see.

496
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:55,550
Maybe I'll check it out.

497
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:57,810
Maybe I'll check it out next time.

498
00:26:59,470 --> 00:26:59,950
Um...

499
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:00,450
Um...

500
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:01,310
But that's interesting.

501
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,810
I feel like they didn't advertise this game at all.

502
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:05,210
I've never seen anything about it.

503
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:05,970
Um...

504
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:07,550
Is Hades 2 way more complete now?

505
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:10,010
I'm gonna wait until Hades 2 fully releases.

506
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,770
Before I actually play.

507
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:14,670
Because when I play Hades 2...

508
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,750
I want to play it in its entirety.

509
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:17,950
You know, chat?

510
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:21,550
I just want to play it until completion.

511
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:24,970
Because I don't want to play it where I have to stop somewhere.

512
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:31,170
Where I have to stop somewhere and wait until the next chapter to be released.

513
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,410
Because I want it to be a full, long series.

514
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:34,630
Um...

515
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:35,990
No, it's not fully released yet.

516
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:41,730
They're like, slowly adding more and more content to the game until they finish...

517
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,150
Until like, to completion.

518
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:44,110
Um...

519
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,270
What else did I want to talk about?

520
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:45,930
Fuck!

521
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:47,990
I had something else I wanted to talk about but I forgot.

522
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:50,970
Uh, bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu...

523
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:55,970
Sorry, um...

524
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:59,430
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

525
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:04,250
Sorry, I can't say...

526
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,010
I can't.

527
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:06,950
Oh...

528
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:07,670
Oh my god.

529
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:17,770
I'm sorry, I can't say what I just saw, because NDA, but it's pretty cool.

530
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:23,490
Oh my god, I'm freaking out.

531
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,270
I wish I could say it!

532
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:26,090
Fuck!

533
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,510
Okay, I can't.

534
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:31,030
I hope this gets approved.

535
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:36,330
I hope it gets approved.

536
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:37,530
Oh my god!

537
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,590
Holy shit, okay.

538
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,550
Okay, we're cool, we're cool.

539
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:49,650
We're cool.

540
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,550
We're so cool.

541
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:56,150
Jack, thank you for the super chat.

542
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,390
Thank you, thank you.

543
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:00,990
Have you ever thought about playing NieR Automata?

544
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:04,630
Also, I gave my first super chat two streams ago, and you didn't see, so I ask again.

545
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:07,930
Nandoki, thank you for the super chat!

546
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:10,590
Thank you, so sorry to see your very first super chat!

547
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:12,350
Thank you, thank you!

548
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:17,090
Oh my god, Nandoki, you mean Priestoki.

549
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:17,450
Okay.

550
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:21,970
I'm here.

551
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:27,030
Repent, repent in super chats, guys.

552
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:30,550
Are you here to repent, Jack?

553
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:31,770
Thank you for the super chat.

554
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:32,770
Thank you, thank you.

555
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:35,630
Just tell us if our wallets are in further danger.

556
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:37,550
PapaSmart, thank you for the super chat.

557
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:38,830
Thank you, thank you.

558
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,570
I don't know.

559
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:41,630
I don't know.

560
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:47,590
Asumi, thank you for your very first super chat.

561
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:48,770
Thank you, thank you.

562
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:53,330
When will you have one eye, so you can be hard like Xiaodong?

563
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:56,170
Thank you for the super chat.

564
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,110
Thank you, thank you.

565
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:59,350
Guys, I don't think I'm chuny enough, chat.

566
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:02,250
I'm not chuny enough to have one eye yet.

567
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:04,970
Thank you for the super chat.

568
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,070
Thank you, thank you.

569
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:07,170
Your very first super chat.

570
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:09,410
Oh my god, I just realized.

571
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,530
Ah, fuck.

572
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:14,090
I remember what I wanted to talk about, and then I forgot about it again.

573
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:14,950
Fuck, okay.

574
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,410
The phone call.

575
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:19,630
I forgot to talk about the phone call, though.

576
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:23,630
So the phone call was actually...

577
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:34,150
For those who are wondering what the phone call was, the phone call was basically one of the cleaning services that I tried to reach out to, but never got back to me.

578
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:37,110
And then, like, I literally said I needed a cleaner at Sunday.

579
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:41,850
And then they called back to me, like, today, and was like, do you still need cleaning service?

580
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:45,450
And I was like, no, I needed it on Sunday.

581
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:49,270
I don't need it anymore.

582
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:52,290
So, yeah.

583
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:58,350
That was the phone call, and I was like, I knew I shouldn't... I knew I should've never picked up phone calls, guys.

584
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:07,830
See, this basically reinforces my belief that never pick up phone calls, because if it's important enough, it'll go to voicemail.

585
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:11,110
Because, like, I'm also like, who calls me?

586
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:13,410
I don't give my number out to anybody.

587
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:16,210
So I was like, who the fuck is calling me?

588
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:22,790
And the people that do have my number would text me or message me on Discord.

589
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:34,370
I'm like, if you ever would've reached him... Honestly, I would most likely be more reachable on Discord than I would be on my phone.

590
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:39,910
Because I have... My phone is on silent mode, so it, like, you know, obviously it doesn't ring or anything.

591
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:42,530
So it vibrates whenever I get, like, you know, notifications.

592
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:50,390
But the thing is, because it, like, vibrates when it gets notifications, I won't hear it because I'm wearing my fucking headphones.

593
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:52,970
Even if my phone is near me, I won't be able to hear it.

594
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:59,090
So it's easier to reach out to me on Discord, because, like, I'm on my PC if I have my headphones on.

595
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:04,130
So I'm like... So people would most likely reach out to me on my... on Discord.

596
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:09,990
And the ones who have my phone number would just message me on Discord if they ever want to reach out to me.

597
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,810
So I was like, who the fuck is calling me?

598
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:13,110
Anyway...

599
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:14,170
Oh, yes!

600
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:16,770
Someone asked me my opinion on Dynasty Warriors Origins.

601
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:29,050
The only critique I have about the new Dynasty Warriors game is that I wish I get to play the actual characters more than my... the self-insert.

602
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:40,790
Because, like, not gonna lie, you know, it's great that I'm romancing other Chinese generals, but I would prefer to play as the generals and then romancing other generals.

603
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:52,800
I feel like... not gonna lie, I think I would be much more into it and much more, like, you know, I think I'm still into it.

604
00:32:53,020 --> 00:33:03,600
But, like, I definitely would think it would be much more enjoyable if I was playing as one of the Chinese generals and then doing the same thing.

605
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:08,640
Because...

606
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,240
Anyway, I am reformed, though, by the way.

607
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,760
I am very much reformed.

608
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:28,880
Just imagine if I was playing, like, Guan Yun or something and I was talking to Lu Bu and it's the same dialogue.

609
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:35,860
I feel like it would be a lot more... it would be a lot more funnier, too.

610
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:40,900
It would be a lot more funnier, as well.

611
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,400
Yoshi, thank you for the super chat.

612
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,220
Thank you, thank you.

613
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,400
Wait, important question.

614
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,820
Can you romance Lian Shi?

615
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,260
Wait, who's Lian Shi again?

616
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,600
Who's Lian Shi?

617
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,120
Wait, I don't think I remember Lian Shi.

618
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:57,840
Wait, who's Lian...

619
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:03,060
Oh, for Lady Bu, one of Sun Quan's historical wives.

620
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,640
Oh, I don't remember Lian Shi.

621
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,400
Did they add... oh, she added her later.

622
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,620
I don't remember her that much.

623
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,100
To be fair, she's also in, like... she's also Sun Quan's wife.

624
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,900
And, like, I did not care much about Sun Quan.

625
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,120
I think it's because, like, Sun Quan...

626
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:26,480
Sun Quan, like, voice acting back in the older games was a little, like, ridiculous.

627
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:32,420
Like, he sounded like... okay, I remember Sun Quan's voice acting, but I could never take him serious.

628
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,620
Because he sounded, like, a little silly.

629
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:44,740
And he looks a little... he sometimes... like, his very first iteration was a little silly.

630
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,220
So, I could never...

631
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:52,340
I could never, like, get into Sun Quan in general.

632
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:56,180
So, like, I don't think I cared much about Lian Shi because of it.

633
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:58,740
Because he was... she was, like, part of his storyline.

634
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:04,920
So, like, that's why I don't remember... I don't remember Lian Shi at all.

635
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:10,000
I remember, like... oh my god, they gave Sun Shan Xian a fucking bow?!

636
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,220
When did they give her a bow?!

637
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,020
What the fu...

638
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,220
I don't remember... oh, wait, I remember.

639
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:16,800
No, never mind.

640
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,300
I remember her having a bow.

641
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,500
That shit was dumb.

642
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,100
I remember... that was such a... that was so weird when they...

643
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:22,700
I remember... sorry.

644
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:27,620
I remember playing the game where she had a bow and then I blocked it out of my memory.

645
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:32,040
Because I was like, not my Sun Shan... not my Sun Shan Xian.

646
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,360
That's not her.

647
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:38,700
She looked so... and then they changed her entire character design too.

648
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,620
Just for... just for that moment.

649
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,880
Anyway, sorry.

650
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,260
Game time.

651
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,500
It's gaming time.

652
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,220
Anyway...

653
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,120
Alright, sorry.

654
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,100
That was a 40 minute yapping session.

655
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:57,080
It's time... it's time to actually play the game, guys.

656
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:57,880
Alright.

657
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,500
Next scene.

658
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,140
Thank you for the super chat.

659
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,480
Thank you, thank you.

660
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,360
I just feel like, you know...

661
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:14,000
I just think I'd be much more immersed if I'm actually playing as the... you know, the generals in the game.

662
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,740
Because like, you know, they were part of history.

663
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,040
I'm just a self-insert, guys.

664
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,080
It's just that.

665
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:24,580
That's all... that's basically not because I could like, you know...

666
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,740
Aw man, I'm so broke, guys.

667
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,300
Why did no one stop me?

668
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,260
Okay, no, that's fine.

669
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,960
I just sell my older weapons.

670
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,580
That's okay.

671
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:42,400
I might be broke, but I can sell my old other weapons and then be rich again, right guys?

672
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,380
Okay.

673
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,980
It's not even that much money, though.

674
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,500
That sucks.

675
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,240
It's not that much money.

676
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,420
Oh my god, all my fucking fists are weak as hell.

677
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,820
Okay, let's just sell all of these.

678
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,340
Wait, 91?

679
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,580
Which one am I using?

680
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,900
Wait, where am I equip... which one am I...

681
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,040
Okay, okay, it's this.

682
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:05,900
Okay, now 81.

683
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:09,920
Uh, let's sell all the weaker ones first.

684
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,080
And then...

685
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,400
Okay, nice.

686
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,920
Uh, 81...

687
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,230
85...

688
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,340
God, I'm so broke right now.

689
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:22,700
I spent it all on Lu Bu.

690
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:27,200
I spent all my money on Lu Bu, guys.

691
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,980
But Lu Bu was worth it.

692
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,780
It was so worth it, though.

693
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,580
It was so worth it.

694
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:41,440
Okay, let me hydrate real fast.

695
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,360
Uh, Alan, thank you for the super chat.

696
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,600
Thank you, thank you.

697
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:50,770
Danny, thank you for the super chat.

698
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:51,830
Thank you, thank you.

699
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:55,130
Reform, more like you got back into top.

700
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:56,770
Guys, I've reformed.

701
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:58,170
I swear to god.

702
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,490
I swear to god.

703
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,350
I used to...

704
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:02,090
Guys, I was so bad.

705
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,330
I was...

706
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:13,740
Guys, I used to read fanfiction and, like, actively followed.

707
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,600
JP and Korean and Chinese artists.

708
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,920
That would drew artwork of my favorite ships, guys.

709
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:27,240
I was... And then, like, I would find their, like, secret websites.

710
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,880
Where they put the more...

711
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,520
The more...

712
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,420
The down baddest artwork.

713
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:37,420
Where they would put up secret websites of it.

714
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:42,440
And then you have to find the password that they've hidden in their fucking blog.

715
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,260
To access their secret website.

716
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:50,940
Because they don't want just anyone looking at their secret website.

717
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:56,640
They want the most down bad person to find...

718
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:02,960
The ones that can truly appreciate their favorite pairing.

719
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,500
Like, I don't know if they still do that.

720
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,600
But back in my day, when I was a Tumblr...

721
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:12,440
Back in my day, when I was a Tumblr girl.

722
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:19,700
A lot of artists, a lot of the JP Chinese or Korean artists.

723
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:23,160
They would have a separate website or blog.

724
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:28,440
Dedicated to where things go real, real after dark.

725
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,600
So...

726
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,640
And they post their more...

727
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,520
Their more crazier fanart.

728
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,080
So like, you have...

729
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,620
The thing is, you have to find the hidden password.

730
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,880
In their...

731
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,580
In their public...

732
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:46,240
In their public blog.

733
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:49,980
To access the after dark blog.

734
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:58,980
And I was that dedicated to access the after dark blog.

735
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:04,920
To satisfy my wants and needs for specific pairings.

736
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:12,000
So anyway, I'm reformed now.

737
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,660
I don't do that no more.

738
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,100
I'm very, very...

739
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:22,600
I'm very reformed now, guys.

740
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,580
Yes, my wants for these two...

741
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:31,940
My two favorite characters to do very bad things to each other.

742
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,680
But I'm reformed now.

743
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,940
It's not on my mind no more.

744
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,860
I don't have a favorite pairing.

745
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:41,760
I...

746
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,500
I don't have...

747
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,080
I don't do that no more, guys.

748
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,180
I don't do that.

749
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,740
Anyway, I'm too busy having a streaming career.

750
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:57,500
I told you guys what my favorite pairings were back then.

751
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,020
I told you.

752
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:04,430
Guys, okay, by the way...

753
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:05,850
Okay, I'll tell you this story.

754
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:07,110
When I was...

755
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:08,710
Sorry.

756
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:13,470
Okay, I'll tell you.

757
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:15,850
Okay, so like when I was first unpacking...

758
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:22,470
I've only bought two doujins in my entire life.

759
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,650
Because one of the...

760
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:24,970
And both...

761
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:26,790
One of them...

762
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:28,710
And I found they were not...

763
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:30,530
By the way, they were not safe for work.

764
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:31,350
I'll say...

765
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:33,450
They were...

766
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:36,550
They were absolutely not safe for work.

767
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:39,750
But I found one of...

768
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:41,310
I found one of them.

769
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:46,310
And like the only reason why I bought that doujin...

770
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:48,470
Was because it was a rare pair.

771
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:50,510
And like I was literally...

772
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,350
And okay...

773
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:54,050
Since we're playing Dynasty Warriors...

774
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:58,310
It was a Dynasty Warriors rare pairing.

775
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:00,670
So...

776
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:05,690
Like I needed as much content as I can to satisfy...

777
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,150
Like my...

778
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:10,850
My want to see artwork of those two.

779
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:12,030
So...

780
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,150
So...

781
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:15,430
So...

782
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:17,310
So I...

783
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:18,930
When one of my...

784
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:19,270
The...

785
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:21,350
One of the fucking five...

786
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:22,470
Three artists...

787
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:24,490
Good artists that draws them...

788
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:26,290
Like it was a JP artist.

789
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:27,230
And they were...

790
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:28,430
They were one of those...

791
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:29,450
I think it was like three.

792
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:31,470
They were one of three JP artists...

793
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:33,290
That I was able to find...

794
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:35,290
That fucking satisfy...

795
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:39,650
My itch to see those two characters...

796
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:40,850
Do stuff to each other.

797
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:44,030
So...

798
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:44,810
So...

799
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:46,670
And it was very difficult...

800
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:47,590
Because it's like...

801
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:48,650
It was a rare pair.

802
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:49,610
So like...

803
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:51,450
There's barely any content.

804
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:52,810
I'll be like...

805
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:53,730
Please feed me.

806
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:54,870
I'm fucking dying.

807
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:58,550
I was like...

808
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:00,450
Please feed me.

809
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:01,730
I'm dying.

810
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:02,730
I'm starving.

811
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:05,510
I'm fucking starving.

812
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:07,710
And so...

813
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:10,150
The artist released a doujin.

814
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:12,050
And then I was like...

815
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:13,170
Oh my god.

816
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:14,130
I...

817
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:15,950
Thank you for feeding me.

818
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:17,170
Thank you.

819
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:17,970
Thank you.

820
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:20,310
Thank you for feeding me.

821
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:23,250
And I fucking ordered that straight away.

822
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:24,390
And...

823
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:26,030
And...

824
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:27,030
I was like...

825
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:28,090
Oh my god.

826
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:28,630
I'm sorry.

827
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:29,990
Thank you.

828
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:31,310
And so it was like...

829
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:32,670
My very first time...

830
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:34,390
I've ever owned...

831
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:36,290
I've ever owned...

832
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:37,930
Like a doujin before.

833
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:39,090
Because like...

834
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:40,090
Literally like...

835
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:41,690
It was such a rare pair.

836
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:43,030
That I was just like...

837
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:44,110
I need this.

838
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:47,290
I required sustenance.

839
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:48,350
And like...

840
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:49,590
I found it.

841
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:50,370
I was like...

842
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:51,830
Oh my god.

843
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:53,210
I found it.

844
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:54,210
And then I like...

845
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:56,030
Messaged one of my friends.

846
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:57,590
Because like...

847
00:43:58,210 --> 00:43:59,890
Because I messaged one of my friends.

848
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:00,650
And then...

849
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:01,570
I was like...

850
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:02,630
I found something.

851
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:03,690
And he was like...

852
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:03,970
What?

853
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:05,370
And I was just like...

854
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:05,990
It's...

855
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:10,330
I took a picture of the inside of it.

856
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:11,150
And he was like...

857
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:13,650
Why did you send me that?

858
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:15,450
I was like...

859
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:16,810
I was just like...

860
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:18,470
It's my very first doujin.

861
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:21,150
When I was like...

862
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:22,290
A fujo.

863
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:29,670
I was like...

864
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:31,530
Not to cut the content.

865
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:36,190
Okay.

866
00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:37,410
Guys.

867
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:38,750
I was a fujo.

868
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:39,670
I'm Kira now.

869
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:40,710
I'm reformed.

870
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:44,970
I'm reformed.

871
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:45,870
Check it out, bro.

872
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:46,690
I was like...

873
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:47,670
Bro, check it out.

874
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:48,870
This is what I used to be.

875
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:55,670
Okay, I won't tell you my rare pair, guys.

876
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:57,790
Guys, they're historical figures.

877
00:44:58,430 --> 00:44:59,210
I can't.

878
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:00,650
I can't, guys.

879
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:01,330
They're historical.

880
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:02,970
They're actual real people.

881
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:05,810
I can't tell you who my rare pair was.

882
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:07,330
I can't.

883
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:13,570
You buy my silence, chat.

884
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:15,050
I can't do it for free.

885
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:17,910
I already gave so much info, guys.

886
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:20,830
You gotta buy my silence for this.

887
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,810
Thank you for the super chat.

888
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:24,270
Thank you.

889
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:25,170
Thank you.

890
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:27,310
I found two doujins.

891
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:27,810
Ah, yes.

892
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:30,210
I also enjoyed Tao Tao's poems.

893
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:31,170
Thank you for the super chat.

894
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:31,590
Thank you.

895
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:32,370
Thank you.

896
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:37,830
Anton.

897
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:39,450
Thank you for the super chat.

898
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:39,890
Thank you.

899
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:40,970
Thank you.

900
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:47,070
The lady who screams and busts muff buff muscle men, flaring dinosaur warriors.

901
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:49,870
Don't protest too much.

902
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:51,410
Anton.

903
00:45:51,410 --> 00:45:53,610
Thank you for the super chat.

904
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:54,550
Thank you.

905
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:55,810
Oh, my God.

906
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:56,790
Thank you.

907
00:45:56,810 --> 00:45:57,410
Thank you.

908
00:45:57,730 --> 00:45:58,530
Thank you.

909
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:00,710
Thank you.

910
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:01,590
Thank you.

911
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:06,960
Oh, my funds are revealed.

912
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:08,920
The rare pair.

913
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:10,940
Go on and tell us.

914
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:12,920
Thank you for the super chat, PK.

915
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:13,660
Thank you.

916
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:14,620
Thank you.

917
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,140
Oh, no.

918
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:17,600
Please.

919
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:20,500
No.

920
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:22,760
Oh, my God.

921
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:23,940
Guys.

922
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:24,520
Okay.

923
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,920
This is, like, extreme rare pair.

924
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:29,760
I will admit, it was actually...

925
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:33,060
It was, like...

926
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,760
It's, like, really, really...

927
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,420
It's, like, extreme rare pair.

928
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:44,040
That's...

929
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,060
Oh, man.

930
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:48,840
Okay.

931
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:49,180
Okay.

932
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:49,560
Okay.

933
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:51,960
Oh, fuck.

934
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:52,240
Okay.

935
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:52,820
It's a little...

936
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:56,440
It's a little embarrassing, guys.

937
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:01,840
Oh, my God.

938
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:04,300
It's a little...

939
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,660
It's a little embarrassing, guys.

940
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:08,720
It's...

941
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:09,820
Oh, man.

942
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,240
Okay.

943
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,120
Okay.

944
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:14,960
It's...

945
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:18,680
I'm...

946
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:19,880
I'm trying to...

947
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,460
Oh, my God.

948
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:24,200
We're...

949
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,540
We're listening.

950
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,040
Okay, guys.

951
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:27,840
Okay, guys.

952
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:30,480
I just need you guys to know...

953
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:36,000
There was barely any content of it.

954
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,960
And, like, I...

955
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,360
I was, like...

956
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,000
I was...

957
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:40,800
I was dying.

958
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:41,400
Okay?

959
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,060
I was dying.

960
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:46,260
And, like, I needed someone to feed me.

961
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:52,320
And it was the rare moments where I can actually be fed.

962
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:54,220
Because, like...

963
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:58,120
There was barely anything...

964
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,640
Anything there at that time.

965
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:02,160
And I was, like, please.

966
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,740
Please feed me.

967
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,040
I just...

968
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:06,520
Please.

969
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:09,180
I just need just a little bit.

970
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:09,920
Just...

971
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:11,920
Just...

972
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,860
Just a little bit.

973
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:17,280
Okay.

974
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:21,420
So, my...

975
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:23,920
My rare pair was...

976
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:27,100
God, I'm so...

977
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:29,360
I talked about it before, too.

978
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:32,180
The thing is, I revealed this before.

979
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:40,580
But, like, now that I gave you more context of how fucking starved I was, it's a little embarrassing.

980
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:43,170
It was...

981
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:48,000
It was Juge Dan and Sima Zhao.

982
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:49,220
And...

983
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:52,820
That was the...

984
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:54,820
That was the doujin I owned.

985
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,090
And then, sometimes...

986
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:04,380
Sometimes, if I'm, like, desperate, I would be okay with Juge Dan and Sima Xi.

987
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,800
But, like, my main pair...

988
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:08,190
My...

989
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:10,150
My...

990
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:15,810
My main pair was Juge Dan and Sima Zhao.

991
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:17,290
And, like...

992
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:20,350
Because, like, Juge Dan is, like, you know...

993
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:21,010
He's, like...

994
00:49:21,010 --> 00:49:22,150
He's, like, the...

995
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:25,250
Yeah, Juge Dan and the Sima Zhao.

996
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:28,150
And I had...

997
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:29,430
And, look...

998
00:49:29,850 --> 00:49:30,590
Look, I...

999
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:31,290
Like...

1000
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:31,870
Look...

1001
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:32,790
Okay, look.

1002
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:35,510
You would understand if you know these characters.

1003
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:37,550
You would understand.

1004
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:38,810
Because, like...

1005
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:40,690
Yeah, Dan is rim and proper.

1006
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:43,070
And Zhao is a bad boy.

1007
00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:44,190
Yes, exactly.

1008
00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:46,550
You know what I'm talking about.

1009
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:47,730
It's, like...

1010
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:55,170
Yes, you know exactly what I'm talking about.

1011
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:03,810
And, like, Juge Dan is, like, the strategist of the Jin Dynasty.

1012
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:05,710
And, like, he's, like...

1013
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:06,550
He's, like...

1014
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:07,190
Oh, yeah.

1015
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:08,610
Like, you're just, like...

1016
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:09,270
And he's, like...

1017
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:10,190
Like, you know, like...

1018
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:11,790
Um...

1019
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:15,410
The suck-up strategist that's trying to prove something.

1020
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:18,750
And...

1021
00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:20,850
And...

1022
00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:22,690
And...

1023
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:23,190
And...

1024
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:23,570
That ain't right.

1025
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:24,850
That's just hate.

1026
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:29,170
Thank you for the super chat.

1027
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:29,530
Thank you.

1028
00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:29,950
Thank you.

1029
00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:33,070
But no one was making content of it.

1030
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:36,410
It's rare because no one was making content.

1031
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:41,470
Guys, I was so down bad for, like...

1032
00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:45,370
I was not used to having a rare pair fixation, guys.

1033
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:49,750
Because in the past, all the pairings I liked had a lot of content.

1034
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:53,030
But I was so desperate for anything.

1035
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:56,670
I went to Pixiv and was, like...

1036
00:50:57,450 --> 00:50:59,390
I went to Pixiv.

1037
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:02,090
That was how desperate I was.

1038
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:06,630
I was, like, trying to find the tags for that specific pairing.

1039
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:08,150
Because I was, like...

1040
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:09,810
I need more content.

1041
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:21,310
And I was trying to find the specific Japanese tag that pertains to that specific pairing, guys.

1042
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:23,630
I needed more content.

1043
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:28,670
I was not used to having a rare pair that I really liked.

1044
00:51:28,890 --> 00:51:30,870
I was not used to it.

1045
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:35,590
Orca, thank you for the super chat.

1046
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:37,470
Thank you, thank you.

1047
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:38,210
Alright.

1048
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:39,710
Anyway, there you go.

1049
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:41,310
I shared my shame, guys.

1050
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:42,310
I...

1051
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:44,770
Guys, I shared my shame today.

1052
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:49,970
I'm reformed now.

1053
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:51,770
I am a reformed Fujo.

1054
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:54,170
I fixed myself, guys.

1055
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:55,410
I'm not...

1056
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:57,650
I'm not like that anymore, guys.

1057
00:51:57,710 --> 00:51:59,890
I swear to God, I have recovered.

1058
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:01,290
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1059
00:52:02,350 --> 00:52:05,290
Oh my God, thank you, Dragos, for the super chat.

1060
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:06,670
Thank you, thank you.

1061
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:08,610
You achieved so much.

1062
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:10,690
Has it all been for peace?

1063
00:52:10,810 --> 00:52:15,550
And the people used to carry out your duties as they came with no greater ambitions.

1064
00:52:16,110 --> 00:52:20,750
But now it seems as though you have a pair of wings ready to take whatever your heart desires.

1065
00:52:21,330 --> 00:52:25,190
Even a cage bird cannot help but yearn for flight after witnessing the sky beyond.

1066
00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:27,970
So where will you go next, Guardian of Peace?

1067
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:29,570
What future do you foresee?

1068
00:52:29,570 --> 00:52:31,530
Oh my God, thank you for the super chat.

1069
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:32,170
Thank you, thank you.

1070
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:35,350
Oh my God, that felt like a natural super chat right... right there.

1071
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:36,890
Alright, Yuan Shao.

1072
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:41,810
Not joking, I didn't expect to see you at the battle, Yuan Shao.

1073
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:43,630
And I've not heard a word from you since.

1074
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:44,950
Have you nothing to say to me?

1075
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:50,070
If you're too timid to call for a meeting, I'll have to give you the opportunity to break this silence myself.

1076
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:53,150
If you do not come to me, you shall regret it.

1077
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:54,630
Okay, we gotta meet Yuan Shao.

1078
00:52:54,890 --> 00:52:56,190
Oh my God, Zhang Yi.

1079
00:52:57,930 --> 00:53:00,130
This was one of my dad's favorite characters.

1080
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:03,750
Please forgive me for this unsolicited letter.

1081
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:08,710
I can only assume it must feel like an ambush of sorts.

1082
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:11,270
Don't allow me to introduce myself.

1083
00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:12,930
Oh, do allow me to introduce myself.

1084
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:14,390
I am Zhang Yi.

1085
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:21,550
And at this moment, there is nothing in the world I would like more than to speak with you.

1086
00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:24,810
Would you be willing to grant me an audience if only this once?

1087
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:31,810
I believe that we may have some degree of compatibility, but one never truly knows.

1088
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:33,670
Until they tried.

1089
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:36,730
If you would agree, then do look forward to my...

1090
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:38,670
Oh my God, Zhang Yi.

1091
00:53:38,930 --> 00:53:40,230
Oh my God.

1092
00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:41,610
Okay.

1093
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:44,070
Okay.

1094
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:45,430
Alright.

1095
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:46,970
Wow.

1096
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:50,610
Not so dead full.

1097
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:51,750
Thank you for the super chat.

1098
00:53:51,830 --> 00:53:52,850
Thank you, thank you.

1099
00:53:52,850 --> 00:53:55,670
I've heard less reforms and more relapsed.

1100
00:53:55,810 --> 00:53:58,250
Enjoy your brilliant man, queen.

1101
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:01,250
Thank you for the super chat.

1102
00:54:01,390 --> 00:54:02,450
Thank you, thank you.

1103
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:03,450
Can't say it.

1104
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:04,490
Thank you for the super chat.

1105
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:05,290
Thank you, thank you.

1106
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:11,510
With one small donation, you too can feed a hungry Fujiyoshi in your area.

1107
00:54:11,970 --> 00:54:14,990
Call this toll-free number now.

1108
00:54:15,430 --> 00:54:16,570
Thank you for the super chat.

1109
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:17,870
Thank you, thank you.

1110
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:18,630
Chill.

1111
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:19,750
Thank you for the super chat.

1112
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:20,090
Thank you.

1113
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:20,570
That is not...

1114
00:54:20,570 --> 00:54:21,050
I don't.

1115
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:23,650
I swear to God, I do not, guys.

1116
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:26,290
I have no favorite pairing in Marvel Rivals, guys.

1117
00:54:26,410 --> 00:54:27,270
I swear to God.

1118
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:34,100
Guys, I didn't even have one in Apex.

1119
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:36,720
All I cared about was the game, guys.

1120
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,660
All I did was grind the game.

1121
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:42,040
I've reformed, guys.

1122
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,740
Ever since I got into gaming, guys.

1123
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:47,780
Ever since I got into rank and gaming and streaming.

1124
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:50,460
I don't do that no more, guys.

1125
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:51,040
I swear.

1126
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:53,900
I've reformed.

1127
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,340
I'm too busy.

1128
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:55,940
Bro.

1129
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:56,620
Bro.

1130
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:57,520
Trust me, bro.

1131
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:58,820
Bro, I'm one of you.

1132
00:54:59,040 --> 00:54:59,240
Bro.

1133
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,160
Bros, guys.

1134
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,920
I'm too busy gaming, bro.

1135
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:03,640
Trust me.

1136
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:07,080
Affiliate.

1137
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:11,260
I can't believe you pulled a bone card, bro.

1138
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,020
Affiliate, thank you for the five kisses.

1139
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:18,240
Thank you.

1140
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:19,100
Thank you.

1141
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:20,920
I swear, bro.

1142
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:21,820
It's different now.

1143
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:22,980
I swear.

1144
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,040
Wait, thank you for the super chat.

1145
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:28,400
Thank you.

1146
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:29,180
Thank you.

1147
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,440
I'm a Fudanshi.

1148
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:31,980
I feel your pain.

1149
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:33,980
Thank you for the super chat.

1150
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:34,620
Thank you.

1151
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:35,400
Thank you.

1152
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:36,780
Oh, shit.

1153
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:37,660
Damn, wait.

1154
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:38,360
What's this?

1155
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,060
Yeah, but he wants to see me.

1156
00:55:58,570 --> 00:55:59,170
Oh, wait.

1157
00:55:59,210 --> 00:56:00,470
I forgot to be Left Side Doki.

1158
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:02,350
Alright, goodbye Right Side Doki.

1159
00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:04,570
You shall cease to exist now.

1160
00:56:05,590 --> 00:56:07,270
Alright, where's Left Side Doki?

1161
00:56:07,310 --> 00:56:08,810
Where did I put Left Side Doki?

1162
00:56:08,890 --> 00:56:09,670
There you are.

1163
00:56:10,330 --> 00:56:11,870
Left Side Doki is different, guys.

1164
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:17,090
Left Side Doki is even more reformed.

1165
00:56:29,330 --> 00:56:31,650
Aww, he adopted him.

1166
00:56:42,530 --> 00:56:43,530
That's me.

1167
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:44,410
I'm special.

1168
00:56:44,970 --> 00:56:47,590
I'm Cao Cao's favorite special guest.

1169
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:53,850
I'm more reformed, by the way.

1170
00:56:54,510 --> 00:56:57,070
I'm the more reformed Doki.

1171
00:56:57,070 --> 00:57:02,050
What did Left Side Doki and Right Side Doki kiss?

1172
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:04,610
Alright, thank you for the super chat.

1173
00:57:04,810 --> 00:57:05,750
Thank you, thank you.

1174
00:57:14,210 --> 00:57:16,430
Wait, they're still around?

1175
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:19,430
Yeah, they're for...

1176
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:20,430
Yeah, exactly.

1177
00:57:21,050 --> 00:57:22,030
Bro, in the other...

1178
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:25,810
I mean, they are remnants of them in actual history.

1179
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:28,950
But in the other Dynasty Warriors, when you kill them, they're just gone.

1180
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:29,890
They never existed.

1181
00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:38,510
Yeah, I killed him.

1182
00:57:39,050 --> 00:57:39,830
They don't know that.

1183
00:57:43,830 --> 00:57:46,030
He literally looks like Lu Bu's younger brother.

1184
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:48,810
He's like 30.

1185
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:53,970
He's like almost the same age as Sun Jian.

1186
00:57:55,810 --> 00:58:03,350
Our lord was appointed to the post because the former governor, Liu Dai, was murdered by these yellow turbans from Qing.

1187
00:58:04,530 --> 00:58:12,850
It has benefited us to have this territory as a base, but we cannot govern properly while such a threat lingers.

1188
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:15,110
Right.

1189
00:58:15,470 --> 00:58:20,330
And if those rebels were to launch a full-on invasion, the whole province would be devastated.

1190
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:24,310
We have heard reports that they don't even bring their own supplies.

1191
00:58:25,370 --> 00:58:26,450
What the fuck?

1192
00:58:27,590 --> 00:58:28,990
That's so risky.

1193
00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:38,770
How the fuck would you rely on stealing?

1194
00:58:39,150 --> 00:58:40,770
You know you're immune to steal stuff.

1195
00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:42,510
Do not think of them as mere rabble.

1196
00:58:42,990 --> 00:58:44,830
They're an enemy willing to do anything.

1197
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:46,310
Treat them as such.

1198
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:50,290
They're unlike the yellow turbans we fought before.

1199
00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:52,510
So keep your guard up.

1200
00:58:54,350 --> 00:58:55,850
Remember... what was her name?

1201
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:57,290
The flute girl?

1202
00:58:57,530 --> 00:58:57,770
Sorry.

1203
00:58:58,830 --> 00:58:59,910
Tao Pei's wife.

1204
00:59:00,390 --> 00:59:02,650
And she was like, man, you're so lucky.

1205
00:59:03,230 --> 00:59:10,030
I wish I can be like... I wish I can be... I can experience the outside world and there's literally like poverty and death.

1206
00:59:10,030 --> 00:59:11,190
And I was like, do you really?

1207
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:12,630
Chen Ji, yeah.

1208
00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:13,110
I was like...

1209
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:16,410
I was like, was it Chen Ji?

1210
00:59:16,450 --> 00:59:17,750
I can't... I couldn't fully remember.

1211
00:59:17,910 --> 00:59:19,870
I was like not that sure of myself.

1212
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:23,750
And she was like, I wish I could be just like you.

1213
00:59:23,970 --> 00:59:28,150
And I was like, do you... Oh my god, you're so... you're so sheltered.

1214
00:59:28,570 --> 00:59:30,990
There's literally people eating each other right now.

1215
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:32,830
Alright, Yuan Shao, what do you want to talk about?

1216
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:41,070
What do you want, Yuan Shao?

1217
00:59:46,770 --> 00:59:48,050
That's me!

1218
00:59:56,690 --> 00:59:58,690
By chance?

1219
01:00:08,830 --> 01:00:09,630
That's me!

1220
01:00:09,790 --> 01:00:10,430
I'm healthy!

1221
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:11,730
And reformed.

1222
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:16,850
I'm just a mercenary for hire.

1223
01:00:32,470 --> 01:00:34,390
Like a true great...

1224
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:38,830
Such truthful words.

1225
01:00:39,070 --> 01:00:40,730
Nobles are truly so great.

1226
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:42,810
Blurgo, thank you for the super chat.

1227
01:00:42,850 --> 01:00:43,810
Thank you, thank you.

1228
01:00:44,110 --> 01:00:48,050
Dude, I gotta say... Doki, I gotta say thank you and curse you thrice over.

1229
01:00:48,430 --> 01:00:51,650
I'm now dignant once more in the battle for Middle-Earth.

1230
01:00:55,190 --> 01:01:00,370
Wait, he prepared feast for me?

1231
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:03,130
Oh my god!

1232
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:04,970
Oh, he's definitely courting me.

1233
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:06,810
Oh my god, a feast?

1234
01:01:06,810 --> 01:01:12,550
I think he's into me, guys.

1235
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:18,890
That's right.

1236
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:21,270
Throw money at the problem, it always works.

1237
01:01:21,870 --> 01:01:22,870
Well, I mean, for me it does.

1238
01:01:22,990 --> 01:01:24,010
It actually always works.

1239
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:28,070
Whoa!

1240
01:01:32,290 --> 01:01:33,690
Whoa!

1241
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:36,510
Whoa!

1242
01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:40,650
Bro!

1243
01:01:42,010 --> 01:01:44,370
Not Doki, you're wild!

1244
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:46,190
I wish you were...

1245
01:01:46,190 --> 01:01:46,830
Whoa!

1246
01:01:48,410 --> 01:01:49,250
Yeah.

1247
01:01:51,630 --> 01:01:53,030
Damn!

1248
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:05,290
Damn!

1249
01:02:05,290 --> 01:02:07,550
Hi, problem.

1250
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:09,970
Gavin, thank you for the super chat.

1251
01:02:10,390 --> 01:02:11,430
Thank you, thank you.

1252
01:02:23,730 --> 01:02:26,110
Oh, so it's after the food, though?

1253
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:27,390
Oh yeah, chow.

1254
01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:30,650
Oh, look at the way he looks at me!

1255
01:02:30,970 --> 01:02:32,170
Oh my god!

1256
01:02:32,650 --> 01:02:35,430
Bro, what happens after the food?

1257
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:39,810
Bro, that fucking stare!

1258
01:02:40,450 --> 01:02:42,110
That glance right after!

1259
01:02:46,090 --> 01:02:47,470
Guys, I'm rooting for him, I swear.

1260
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:50,310
The feast with you was entertaining to say the least.

1261
01:02:50,470 --> 01:02:53,010
As a reward, I shall bestow you with this.

1262
01:02:53,330 --> 01:02:55,310
Oh, he just makes me do more stuff?

1263
01:02:55,310 --> 01:02:55,710
Okay.

1264
01:02:59,570 --> 01:03:01,030
I'm reformed, guys.

1265
01:03:01,150 --> 01:03:03,590
I swear to god, I am better now.

1266
01:03:03,870 --> 01:03:05,750
Okay, I'm 23.

1267
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:07,750
Okay.

1268
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:09,150
Oh, I get to have an accessory!

1269
01:03:12,730 --> 01:03:15,550
Guys, all we had was dinner, guys.

1270
01:03:15,650 --> 01:03:16,350
That's it.

1271
01:03:16,730 --> 01:03:18,510
Nothing else happened, guys.

1272
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:21,630
We just had dinner, okay?

1273
01:03:21,910 --> 01:03:27,490
He gave me a gift after, but like, it doesn't mean anything, guys.

1274
01:03:27,490 --> 01:03:31,290
He gave me a gift right after dinner, but it meant nothing.

1275
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:33,690
Okay, let's see.

1276
01:03:34,690 --> 01:03:38,950
Gong Ning battle with using the short 100 with using a battle spear.

1277
01:03:39,550 --> 01:03:40,570
With charge attack.

1278
01:03:40,690 --> 01:03:42,050
Okay, I just need to do a charge attack.

1279
01:03:42,470 --> 01:03:45,990
I was wondering if I need, like... I remember I had, like, accessories.

1280
01:03:46,330 --> 01:03:47,170
Oh yeah, okay.

1281
01:03:47,870 --> 01:03:48,470
That's fine.

1282
01:03:50,990 --> 01:03:53,070
Alright, let's kill these guys first.

1283
01:03:55,430 --> 01:03:55,910
Okay.

1284
01:03:58,830 --> 01:04:01,330
Yeah, I needed to kill these guys first.

1285
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:04,670
Nice.

1286
01:04:06,130 --> 01:04:13,370
Oh my god, I hate using every... I hate using stuff that's not... that's not the spin... what's it called?

1287
01:04:13,870 --> 01:04:15,250
The spinny wheels one?

1288
01:04:19,410 --> 01:04:22,730
Enemy forces are firing a volley of archers from high ground?

1289
01:04:22,790 --> 01:04:23,630
Where's the high ground?

1290
01:04:24,410 --> 01:04:27,370
Oh wait, guys, where's the high ground?

1291
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:30,250
I don't know where the high ground is.

1292
01:04:34,450 --> 01:04:37,470
Jesus Christ, there's so many people here.

1293
01:04:38,270 --> 01:04:39,570
Where's the high ground?

1294
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:44,170
Oh my god, oh no.

1295
01:04:44,430 --> 01:04:47,190
Guys, I think my entire... I think they're all gonna die.

1296
01:04:48,570 --> 01:04:49,890
Okay, that's fine.

1297
01:04:50,590 --> 01:04:51,850
Everything will be fine.

1298
01:04:51,990 --> 01:04:52,870
I just need to kill him.

1299
01:04:56,010 --> 01:04:57,450
Okay, nice counter.

1300
01:05:00,310 --> 01:05:01,590
But where is it?

1301
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:03,290
Where the fuck is the high ground?

1302
01:05:05,050 --> 01:05:05,770
Oh no.

1303
01:05:06,010 --> 01:05:07,270
Wait, there's more than two?

1304
01:05:08,870 --> 01:05:10,050
Okay, that's fine.

1305
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:11,710
That's fine.

1306
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:14,950
I can... I can fight two.

1307
01:05:16,850 --> 01:05:18,450
Jesus Christ, there's so many people.

1308
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:19,730
There's so many people.

1309
01:05:19,990 --> 01:05:21,390
There's so many people.

1310
01:05:21,890 --> 01:05:22,810
Where are they?

1311
01:05:24,850 --> 01:05:25,970
Okay, that's fine.

1312
01:05:27,470 --> 01:05:27,990
Counter.

1313
01:05:28,910 --> 01:05:29,730
There we go.

1314
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:31,450
My little man.

1315
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:34,210
I'm here for... Oh wait, no, I'm the little man.

1316
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:35,570
I'm here for the short kings.

1317
01:05:36,350 --> 01:05:36,790
Oh shit.

1318
01:05:36,930 --> 01:05:38,430
Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck!

1319
01:05:38,970 --> 01:05:40,190
I was too far!

1320
01:05:43,670 --> 01:05:44,390
It's okay.

1321
01:05:46,330 --> 01:05:47,070
It's fine.

1322
01:05:48,090 --> 01:05:48,730
Got him.

1323
01:05:49,690 --> 01:05:49,990
Nice.

1324
01:05:51,390 --> 01:05:52,530
Where's the other guy?

1325
01:05:52,850 --> 01:05:53,990
Wait, where's the other guy?

1326
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:57,130
There was another guy that I almost killed.

1327
01:05:59,890 --> 01:06:01,790
Okay, I don't know where he is.

1328
01:06:02,350 --> 01:06:04,190
No, no, not the reinforcements.

1329
01:06:04,330 --> 01:06:05,390
No, no.

1330
01:06:06,050 --> 01:06:07,810
I just killed one!

1331
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:09,590
What do you mean there's a reinforcement?

1332
01:06:13,630 --> 01:06:16,370
Jesus, I'm doing nothing to him!

1333
01:06:18,010 --> 01:06:19,290
Okay, nice.

1334
01:06:21,650 --> 01:06:23,050
Oh my god.

1335
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:25,130
Bro, they're doing no damage!

1336
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:29,710
Oh wait, my allies have reached high ground.

1337
01:06:29,770 --> 01:06:30,270
That's good.

1338
01:06:32,490 --> 01:06:32,650
Okay.

1339
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:35,030
Bye.

1340
01:06:36,310 --> 01:06:38,010
Oh my god.

1341
01:06:38,470 --> 01:06:40,590
Why am I doing no damage?

1342
01:06:41,550 --> 01:06:42,590
I do not have enough allies.

1343
01:06:44,370 --> 01:06:44,950
Oh shit.

1344
01:06:47,430 --> 01:06:48,430
Oh fuck!

1345
01:06:48,830 --> 01:06:49,350
Let go!

1346
01:06:49,930 --> 01:06:50,450
No!

1347
01:06:51,190 --> 01:06:51,930
He got it!

1348
01:06:52,010 --> 01:06:53,230
He has so much energy now!

1349
01:06:53,750 --> 01:06:55,370
My guard has fled?!

1350
01:06:56,090 --> 01:06:58,370
When you left me?!

1351
01:07:00,270 --> 01:07:02,850
Dragoons, why did you leave me?!

1352
01:07:04,550 --> 01:07:06,370
What do you mean?!

1353
01:07:08,790 --> 01:07:10,830
Oh my god, I'm still fighting this one guy.

1354
01:07:11,550 --> 01:07:13,730
I will be there, I swear to god.

1355
01:07:15,710 --> 01:07:18,270
I swear to god, I will be there soon.

1356
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:21,470
I have to deal with this right now.

1357
01:07:23,390 --> 01:07:25,970
Oh my god, this fight is taking forever.

1358
01:07:26,570 --> 01:07:29,670
This one guy is taking fucking forever.

1359
01:07:36,350 --> 01:07:36,910
What?!

1360
01:07:36,910 --> 01:07:38,730
Oh my god, what the fuck?

1361
01:07:43,730 --> 01:07:44,170
It's fine.

1362
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:45,250
He's dead.

1363
01:07:47,570 --> 01:07:49,190
Okay, we gotta help this other guy.

1364
01:07:51,310 --> 01:07:53,730
Oh my god, where's the other guy that I have to help?

1365
01:07:54,510 --> 01:07:55,290
He's like right here.

1366
01:07:55,570 --> 01:07:56,910
I have no bread though.

1367
01:07:58,010 --> 01:07:59,030
Don't worry, eat your bread!

1368
01:07:59,110 --> 01:07:59,690
Eat your bread!

1369
01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:02,150
It's fine, he ate his bread!

1370
01:08:06,570 --> 01:08:08,270
I'm so happy he ate his bread!

1371
01:08:10,030 --> 01:08:10,450
It's fine.

1372
01:08:10,890 --> 01:08:12,450
Okay, this guy was so fast.

1373
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:16,290
Oh fuck, okay.

1374
01:08:17,530 --> 01:08:18,270
It's okay.

1375
01:08:19,650 --> 01:08:21,890
He can't be as difficult as that last guy I fought.

1376
01:08:23,090 --> 01:08:23,570
Alright.

1377
01:08:24,330 --> 01:08:24,810
Nice.

1378
01:08:25,930 --> 01:08:26,630
Alright, nice.

1379
01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:26,950
Okay.

1380
01:08:27,610 --> 01:08:28,530
Just gotta break one more.

1381
01:08:29,510 --> 01:08:30,590
Guys, I killed Wu Bu.

1382
01:08:31,670 --> 01:08:32,850
This is easy for me.

1383
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:35,770
I need to find bread though soon.

1384
01:08:36,450 --> 01:08:37,850
I need a lot of bread.

1385
01:08:39,570 --> 01:08:41,770
Oh fuck, I forgot to block in.

1386
01:08:41,770 --> 01:08:43,790
Get over here, send me!

1387
01:08:44,950 --> 01:08:46,070
You're a default model!

1388
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:48,150
I refuse to die to a default!

1389
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:51,810
Okay.

1390
01:08:52,530 --> 01:08:53,210
Break his shield.

1391
01:08:53,970 --> 01:08:55,410
I just need one more shield break.

1392
01:08:57,470 --> 01:08:58,390
Oh fuck!

1393
01:08:59,070 --> 01:09:01,810
No, I refuse to die to a default!

1394
01:09:04,230 --> 01:09:04,830
Nice.

1395
01:09:05,390 --> 01:09:05,590
Alright.

1396
01:09:07,150 --> 01:09:07,750
We did it.

1397
01:09:08,790 --> 01:09:09,250
See that bread?

1398
01:09:09,630 --> 01:09:10,390
He has bread.

1399
01:09:11,770 --> 01:09:14,890
Okay, we gotta go grab some bread at a nearby house real fast.

1400
01:09:16,130 --> 01:09:17,110
Okay, let's grab.

1401
01:09:17,270 --> 01:09:18,150
Let's get bread here.

1402
01:09:19,710 --> 01:09:20,570
Don't die!

1403
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:21,710
I refuse.

1404
01:09:22,430 --> 01:09:26,270
I refuse to die by a fucking default.

1405
01:09:27,570 --> 01:09:28,450
Oh, there it is.

1406
01:09:29,390 --> 01:09:30,170
There's the bread.

1407
01:09:31,610 --> 01:09:34,770
How did my spear not hit the one thing in front of me?

1408
01:09:35,290 --> 01:09:35,910
Okay, nice.

1409
01:09:35,970 --> 01:09:36,290
We have two.

1410
01:09:36,410 --> 01:09:37,170
We have extra bread.

1411
01:09:38,890 --> 01:09:40,470
Alright, raid the village guys.

1412
01:09:41,290 --> 01:09:42,670
I like how...

1413
01:09:42,670 --> 01:09:48,010
I was like, how could they raid a fucking village for food when they could just get supplies?

1414
01:09:48,890 --> 01:09:51,210
Guys, I'm part of the problem.

1415
01:09:52,010 --> 01:09:53,690
I raided that village too.

1416
01:09:55,310 --> 01:09:56,270
There's a guy.

1417
01:09:56,350 --> 01:09:57,450
There's a general right here.

1418
01:09:59,090 --> 01:09:59,530
Nice.

1419
01:09:59,870 --> 01:10:00,930
Get over there.

1420
01:10:01,810 --> 01:10:02,830
We gotta help out.

1421
01:10:06,130 --> 01:10:07,190
That's fucking right.

1422
01:10:07,230 --> 01:10:07,650
Get counted.

1423
01:10:08,410 --> 01:10:11,650
Oh, you don't have a name so I know you'd be easy.

1424
01:10:12,670 --> 01:10:13,650
That's right.

1425
01:10:14,090 --> 01:10:15,510
Get out of here.

1426
01:10:16,030 --> 01:10:17,170
You don't matter.

1427
01:10:17,610 --> 01:10:20,050
You matter even less because you have no name.

1428
01:10:21,470 --> 01:10:23,250
And then we gotta take this base.

1429
01:10:26,110 --> 01:10:27,150
Alright, get over here.

1430
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:28,290
Open it.

1431
01:10:28,970 --> 01:10:29,930
Open the base!

1432
01:10:30,730 --> 01:10:32,070
Doki is coming in!

1433
01:10:32,790 --> 01:10:33,670
Get in here!

1434
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:35,150
Okay, nice.

1435
01:10:35,910 --> 01:10:37,390
Is there anyone guarding it?

1436
01:10:37,670 --> 01:10:39,250
Like actual people guarding it?

1437
01:10:40,790 --> 01:10:41,510
Oh, nice.

1438
01:10:41,610 --> 01:10:42,450
More bread for me.

1439
01:10:42,850 --> 01:10:44,190
You ain't stealing your supplies.

1440
01:10:45,390 --> 01:10:46,770
I'm not a thief, guys.

1441
01:10:47,630 --> 01:10:49,250
I'm just taking my taxes.

1442
01:10:50,170 --> 01:10:52,250
They're just my tax payments, guys.

1443
01:10:53,710 --> 01:10:55,030
I'm a tax collector.

1444
01:10:56,690 --> 01:10:56,990
Oh, shit.

1445
01:10:57,050 --> 01:10:57,350
No!

1446
01:10:57,530 --> 01:10:59,410
I didn't mean to use my bar up!

1447
01:10:59,530 --> 01:10:59,850
Oh, wait.

1448
01:10:59,870 --> 01:11:00,210
I didn't.

1449
01:11:00,270 --> 01:11:00,490
Okay.

1450
01:11:00,950 --> 01:11:01,330
Thank God.

1451
01:11:01,330 --> 01:11:04,930
I thought I accidentally used my musou.

1452
01:11:05,530 --> 01:11:06,970
I'm not a thief, guys.

1453
01:11:07,470 --> 01:11:08,910
I'm just taking what I was owed.

1454
01:11:09,550 --> 01:11:10,330
That's different.

1455
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:18,450
Get over here.

1456
01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:20,010
Come on, challenge me!

1457
01:11:23,090 --> 01:11:24,310
Challenge me!

1458
01:11:26,970 --> 01:11:30,670
Please, it's easier if you challenge me!

1459
01:11:32,110 --> 01:11:32,550
Nice.

1460
01:11:34,210 --> 01:11:34,890
Oh, fuck.

1461
01:11:34,950 --> 01:11:35,470
I missed it.

1462
01:11:36,310 --> 01:11:36,850
It's fine.

1463
01:11:36,990 --> 01:11:37,590
It's fine.

1464
01:11:37,630 --> 01:11:38,130
I'm okay.

1465
01:11:40,310 --> 01:11:41,050
So, where's your shout?

1466
01:11:41,170 --> 01:11:42,470
Wait, where the fuck did he come from?

1467
01:11:42,690 --> 01:11:42,870
Wait!

1468
01:11:44,070 --> 01:11:44,710
Wait up!

1469
01:11:44,930 --> 01:11:45,450
Wait up!

1470
01:11:45,490 --> 01:11:45,730
Fuck!

1471
01:11:46,030 --> 01:11:47,470
He just was like...

1472
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:48,310
Peekaboo!

1473
01:11:51,110 --> 01:11:52,290
I was like...

1474
01:11:52,290 --> 01:11:54,470
Wait, where the fuck did he come from?

1475
01:11:55,070 --> 01:11:57,730
He literally just appeared in front of him.

1476
01:11:58,950 --> 01:11:59,390
Nice.

1477
01:12:02,310 --> 01:12:03,550
Wait, I wanna...

1478
01:12:03,550 --> 01:12:04,370
I don't wanna target him.

1479
01:12:04,490 --> 01:12:05,390
I wanna...

1480
01:12:05,390 --> 01:12:05,890
There you go.

1481
01:12:07,910 --> 01:12:08,610
Nice counter.

1482
01:12:10,450 --> 01:12:12,490
I was like, where did you come from?

1483
01:12:14,090 --> 01:12:14,490
Nice.

1484
01:12:14,570 --> 01:12:16,750
I get to have a 2 for 1 special.

1485
01:12:18,730 --> 01:12:19,130
No!

1486
01:12:19,510 --> 01:12:19,810
Oh, wait.

1487
01:12:19,850 --> 01:12:20,450
No, he's still here.

1488
01:12:21,730 --> 01:12:22,430
That's what you are.

1489
01:12:22,490 --> 01:12:23,150
Get over here.

1490
01:12:24,230 --> 01:12:25,470
Wait, I can kill him right now.

1491
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:28,550
Let me just kill him just for XP.

1492
01:12:29,510 --> 01:12:30,970
I need you for XP, buddy.

1493
01:12:32,150 --> 01:12:33,290
There we go.

1494
01:12:33,290 --> 01:12:33,930
Oh, fuck.

1495
01:12:34,030 --> 01:12:34,270
Not...

1496
01:12:34,270 --> 01:12:35,010
Not there you go.

1497
01:12:35,870 --> 01:12:36,730
Give me your XP!

1498
01:12:37,710 --> 01:12:38,150
Nice!

1499
01:12:40,110 --> 01:12:40,970
Wait, where's your Inshall?

1500
01:12:41,150 --> 01:12:43,630
I like fucking chucked him all the way there?

1501
01:12:43,810 --> 01:12:44,690
What the fuck?

1502
01:12:45,990 --> 01:12:47,430
I was like, where did he go?

1503
01:12:48,730 --> 01:12:52,070
I like how I just randomly chucked him all the way to the other side.

1504
01:12:52,890 --> 01:12:53,310
Oh, fuck.

1505
01:12:54,730 --> 01:12:55,610
Oh, shit!

1506
01:12:57,530 --> 01:12:58,730
Can't dodge that.

1507
01:13:00,050 --> 01:13:02,890
Can't ever keep forgetting you can't dodge that.

1508
01:13:03,670 --> 01:13:04,430
Okay, nice.

1509
01:13:04,590 --> 01:13:05,810
I broke his other armor piece.

1510
01:13:08,130 --> 01:13:08,690
Please.

1511
01:13:09,150 --> 01:13:09,710
Die!

1512
01:13:10,910 --> 01:13:13,670
I like how I just talked to him just to kill him again.

1513
01:13:14,010 --> 01:13:17,990
He bought me dinner and then I was like, alright, time to kill you.

1514
01:13:21,350 --> 01:13:21,910
Okay.

1515
01:13:23,210 --> 01:13:23,770
Nice.

1516
01:13:25,970 --> 01:13:26,450
Okay.

1517
01:13:28,030 --> 01:13:28,870
One more.

1518
01:13:29,590 --> 01:13:30,950
Just one more kill.

1519
01:13:31,070 --> 01:13:31,710
One more stab.

1520
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:32,230
Woo!

1521
01:13:33,070 --> 01:13:33,630
Woo!

1522
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:35,470
Goodbye.

1523
01:13:39,370 --> 01:13:39,930
Nice!

1524
01:13:42,550 --> 01:13:43,110
Yay!

1525
01:13:45,390 --> 01:13:46,790
I did it!

1526
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:48,250
Thanks for the dinner, Inshall.

1527
01:13:48,550 --> 01:13:50,150
I really appreciate it.

1528
01:13:51,150 --> 01:13:52,630
Thanks for the free meal.

1529
01:13:52,770 --> 01:13:53,710
I'll kill you now.

1530
01:13:55,070 --> 01:13:55,630
Nice.

1531
01:13:55,630 --> 01:13:56,150
Alright.

1532
01:13:56,750 --> 01:13:57,130
Skill points.

1533
01:13:57,270 --> 01:13:58,030
Did I do it?

1534
01:13:58,910 --> 01:14:00,330
Oh, I didn't do 500.

1535
01:14:00,590 --> 01:14:00,930
Fuck!

1536
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:02,250
Okay, I need five.

1537
01:14:02,370 --> 01:14:03,490
I need...

1538
01:14:03,490 --> 01:14:05,510
I need a few more left.

1539
01:14:05,690 --> 01:14:07,430
And then what about my other training?

1540
01:14:08,330 --> 01:14:08,810
62.

1541
01:14:08,950 --> 01:14:10,810
I only did 62 with that?

1542
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:15,350
Oh, no.

1543
01:14:15,410 --> 01:14:17,830
I definitely forgot about the charge attack, though.

1544
01:14:18,330 --> 01:14:19,050
I forgot to use...

1545
01:14:19,050 --> 01:14:20,890
I forgot my spear has a charge attack.

1546
01:14:20,990 --> 01:14:22,070
I was definitely not charging.

1547
01:14:23,770 --> 01:14:25,310
I felt like I was like...

1548
01:14:25,310 --> 01:14:27,210
I felt like I was killing so many people!

1549
01:14:30,210 --> 01:14:30,730
Nice.

1550
01:14:30,970 --> 01:14:31,970
Sorry about that, buddy.

1551
01:14:33,790 --> 01:14:35,350
Hey, thanks for the...

1552
01:14:35,350 --> 01:14:36,570
Thanks for the free food.

1553
01:14:36,670 --> 01:14:38,090
I really appreciate it.

1554
01:14:39,870 --> 01:14:41,110
Hey, peace has risen!

1555
01:14:41,430 --> 01:14:42,990
Whoa, I brought more peace!

1556
01:14:44,410 --> 01:14:45,730
No need to thank me.

1557
01:14:46,170 --> 01:14:47,010
I'm a hero.

1558
01:14:48,170 --> 01:14:49,170
Okay, let's see.

1559
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:50,090
Where do I go?

1560
01:14:52,230 --> 01:14:53,910
Oh, I have someone to talk to.

1561
01:14:54,050 --> 01:14:54,490
Who's he?

1562
01:14:56,190 --> 01:14:56,770
Wait, who are you?

1563
01:14:56,830 --> 01:14:57,830
Oh, is this Zhang Yi?

1564
01:15:00,030 --> 01:15:00,690
Oh, Zero.

1565
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:01,850
Thank you for the super chat.

1566
01:15:01,930 --> 01:15:02,550
Thank you, thank you.

1567
01:15:02,550 --> 01:15:03,210
We all know.

1568
01:15:03,350 --> 01:15:04,130
Not too cute.

1569
01:15:04,230 --> 01:15:04,490
No!

1570
01:15:05,970 --> 01:15:07,090
Oh my God, my turn.

1571
01:15:07,210 --> 01:15:07,310
No!

1572
01:15:13,530 --> 01:15:14,310
Wait, he's less?

1573
01:15:16,370 --> 01:15:18,310
Wait, his voice actor is less?

1574
01:15:22,070 --> 01:15:24,710
Wait, that's not the Zhang Yi I know.

1575
01:15:24,930 --> 01:15:26,370
Wait, what happened to him?

1576
01:15:27,030 --> 01:15:28,650
What happened to him?

1577
01:15:28,850 --> 01:15:30,650
He's less flamboyant.

1578
01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:32,510
What happened?

1579
01:15:33,910 --> 01:15:36,110
Why is he less fabulous?

1580
01:15:45,590 --> 01:15:46,560
Zhang Yi!

1581
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:50,360
What did they do to you?

1582
01:15:56,610 --> 01:15:57,800
Zhang Yi, no!

1583
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:01,020
You used to be so fabulous!

1584
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:04,460
Talk about what?

1585
01:16:21,020 --> 01:16:24,780
I literally massacred my boy.

1586
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:29,600
Trust me, I'm listening.

1587
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:35,340
What did they do to you, my boy?

1588
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,740
Yes, he's the claw guy!

1589
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:46,780
He's the flamboyant, fabulous guy!

1590
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:51,480
Oh my gosh.

1591
01:16:54,780 --> 01:16:57,020
Oh my gosh.

1592
01:16:57,020 --> 01:16:59,860
Wait, maybe I'm like...

1593
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:05,680
Is it crazy to say that I'm taking him out of the closet right now?

1594
01:17:06,980 --> 01:17:10,360
Is that crazy for me to say?

1595
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:15,740
I'm the first.

1596
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:21,840
Zhang Yi.

1597
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:28,160
Your ideal?

1598
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:43,600
I'm the gate awakening!

1599
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:53,620
I'm not even in the service of Liu Bei.

1600
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:56,640
You were merely a guest of theirs.

1601
01:17:57,540 --> 01:18:01,880
The revelation was such a shock that I was forced to reflect on my own life.

1602
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:06,220
You stand on the battlefield of your own volition.

1603
01:18:09,340 --> 01:18:11,540
You give me too much credit.

1604
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:15,960
No, it is you who underestimates your own value.

1605
01:18:16,820 --> 01:18:21,140
I believe that all paths in my life will lead me to the field of battle.

1606
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:25,720
For it is there that I can express my ability to its fullest potential.

1607
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:29,560
Snatching victory from the jaws of a brutal struggle.

1608
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:35,140
It is when I'm close to death that I feel the certainty of why.

1609
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:38,260
I have no hesitation in this way of life.

1610
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:46,880
However, I had never considered the choice of not following someone else.

1611
01:18:47,820 --> 01:18:50,260
Oh, how narrow-minded I have been.

1612
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:53,700
I don't think I can go on fighting much longer.

1613
01:18:54,540 --> 01:18:55,560
Now that I know.

1614
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:01,140
Is that what you think?

1615
01:19:02,660 --> 01:19:03,600
You don't sound...

1616
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:05,500
Oh, fascinating what you do.

1617
01:19:06,820 --> 01:19:11,120
If you don't have no objections, I would like to get to know you better.

1618
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:12,600
Hmm.

1619
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:21,240
Let us spend the night discussing philosophies on...

1620
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:23,600
The fuck does that even mean?

1621
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:28,060
What the fuck does that even mean?

1622
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:31,140
Oh my god.

1623
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:33,640
Okay, for those who don't know what he used to sound like.

1624
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:34,700
Okay, I'll show you guys.

1625
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:36,560
Jung Hee... Okay.

1626
01:19:37,140 --> 01:19:37,520
Fab.

1627
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:39,580
Okay, let's see.

1628
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:41,240
Let's see if I can...

1629
01:19:42,540 --> 01:19:46,080
Let's see if I can find some of my favorite voice acting from this.

1630
01:19:46,540 --> 01:19:46,940
Alright.

1631
01:19:46,940 --> 01:19:47,600
Okay.

1632
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:50,380
Oh, sorry.

1633
01:20:50,540 --> 01:20:52,140
I didn't realize I muted myself.

1634
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:53,420
Oh my god.

1635
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:55,980
Oh man, but I actually muted the round.

1636
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:57,060
I was trying to mute the game.

1637
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:57,840
But like...

1638
01:20:58,700 --> 01:20:59,700
It was so...

1639
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:03,160
No, I accidentally muted my game.

1640
01:21:03,380 --> 01:21:04,380
I muted myself.

1641
01:21:04,580 --> 01:21:05,640
I was trying to mute my game.

1642
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:06,880
But like...

1643
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:08,320
That was what he sounded like.

1644
01:21:08,380 --> 01:21:09,920
He was so fabulous.

1645
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:14,020
And okay, but then in Dynasty Warriors 5...

1646
01:21:14,020 --> 01:21:17,100
They made a cutscene where he was just dancing with his...

1647
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:18,860
With his army.

1648
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:20,780
And you're like...

1649
01:21:20,780 --> 01:21:22,500
Wait, why is he doing that?

1650
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:23,560
It was so...

1651
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:24,680
It was so random.

1652
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:26,640
It was... He was just doing a fucking...

1653
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:27,840
Dance.

1654
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:32,640
Yeah, I muted my game on purpose so you guys can like hear it.

1655
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:33,780
And they like...

1656
01:21:33,780 --> 01:21:34,340
They like...

1657
01:21:34,340 --> 01:21:36,000
He like danced with his army.

1658
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:36,960
And it was like...

1659
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:37,640
And you're like...

1660
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:37,900
Why?

1661
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:39,920
But that's like...

1662
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:40,540
It was my favorite.

1663
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:41,960
It was my dad's favorite.

1664
01:21:42,700 --> 01:21:43,540
And I loved...

1665
01:21:43,540 --> 01:21:44,960
I loved the character too.

1666
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:47,000
Like the style points.

1667
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:48,960
I wonder if Dynasty Warriors 9...

1668
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:49,900
If he was like...

1669
01:21:49,900 --> 01:21:51,100
He was still like that.

1670
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:52,380
Let me see.

1671
01:21:54,380 --> 01:22:00,380
Okay, I'm trying to see his like voice acting in Dynasty Warriors 9.

1672
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:01,500
Oh my gosh.

1673
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:04,080
Was he still the same in Dynasty Warriors 9?

1674
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:07,160
I wish I could be this fabulous.

1675
01:22:07,620 --> 01:22:08,780
I don't remember.

1676
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:11,020
Let's see.

1677
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:13,500
Where is it?

1678
01:22:13,580 --> 01:22:15,060
Where is his character?

1679
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:17,040
Where is his like voice acting?

1680
01:22:17,260 --> 01:22:18,700
Okay, the Zhang He ending.

1681
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:21,220
Does he still sound like that or no?

1682
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:23,580
Is he still fabulous?

1683
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:29,560
Oh, even in Japanese!

1684
01:22:29,980 --> 01:22:32,540
Even in Japanese, he was like...

1685
01:22:36,390 --> 01:22:38,270
Oh my god, the music is louder than him though.

1686
01:22:39,750 --> 01:22:41,270
Are you seeing this?

1687
01:22:41,410 --> 01:22:42,830
He's also...

1688
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:49,500
Oh my god.

1689
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:50,780
He sounds great.

1690
01:22:52,620 --> 01:22:55,420
Oh, it was Dynasty Warriors 9, not in English?

1691
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:56,840
Alright, maybe in...

1692
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:58,140
Oh my god, but yes.

1693
01:22:58,380 --> 01:23:00,340
Back then, he was...

1694
01:23:00,340 --> 01:23:01,280
He used to...

1695
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:02,060
That's why I was like...

1696
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:02,680
Why did they...

1697
01:23:03,180 --> 01:23:04,820
What did they do to you?

1698
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:06,340
Zhang He.

1699
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:08,500
Why are you so normal now?

1700
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:10,160
I don't like it.

1701
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:11,980
I was like...

1702
01:23:11,980 --> 01:23:13,340
I was like...

1703
01:23:13,340 --> 01:23:13,580
No!

1704
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:17,820
Why are you so normal?

1705
01:23:20,060 --> 01:23:22,860
But yeah, you guys wanna hear more about what he sounded like?

1706
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:24,040
This is what he sounded like.

1707
01:23:24,140 --> 01:23:25,300
I was like...

1708
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:25,500
No!

1709
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:29,300
My beautiful peacock man!

1710
01:23:32,820 --> 01:23:36,300
All he wanted to do was dance!

1711
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:38,700
Oh, here's more.

1712
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:59,940
All he cared about was his beauty!

1713
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:03,020
What did they do to you?

1714
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:11,180
Oh my god, I'm so sad!

1715
01:24:11,260 --> 01:24:13,100
What did they do to you?

1716
01:24:15,060 --> 01:24:19,600
You just wanted to show the world your beauty!

1717
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:25,300
I believe everyone has some beauty within them.

1718
01:24:25,420 --> 01:24:30,280
But your beauty, general, will be quite difficult to divine.

1719
01:24:32,140 --> 01:24:34,440
Why do you keep staring at me?

1720
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:35,500
I don't know.

1721
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:36,940
I'm gonna stare.

1722
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:38,160
Do it now.

1723
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:40,400
Dance!

1724
01:24:41,140 --> 01:24:44,980
That feeling when you miss someone you haven't even met.

1725
01:24:53,370 --> 01:24:57,490
He just wanted to beautify the world!

1726
01:24:57,950 --> 01:25:00,650
How could they do this to you?

1727
01:25:03,450 --> 01:25:05,070
How could they?

1728
01:25:05,890 --> 01:25:08,670
How would you make the world beautiful?

1729
01:25:13,350 --> 01:25:14,950
It's a prequel!

1730
01:25:15,330 --> 01:25:18,170
Don't worry, I'll bring it back!

1731
01:25:19,870 --> 01:25:23,410
I found that time spent with you is never wasted.

1732
01:25:24,170 --> 01:25:30,390
I think we can be honest with one another, even if we end up on opposite sides of the battlefield.

1733
01:25:31,890 --> 01:25:34,010
We both find life's meaning in battle.

1734
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:35,330
I'm glad to have met you.

1735
01:25:36,130 --> 01:25:37,590
You're not the same.

1736
01:25:38,210 --> 01:25:41,550
You're not as beautiful as before they took your light.

1737
01:25:41,550 --> 01:25:44,190
They took away your light.

1738
01:25:44,390 --> 01:25:45,990
What if we awaken?

1739
01:25:46,330 --> 01:25:49,070
What if he hasn't awakened to beauty yet?

1740
01:25:49,390 --> 01:25:50,710
Oh my god, you're right!

1741
01:25:51,450 --> 01:25:52,230
You're right!

1742
01:25:52,970 --> 01:25:54,710
Oh my god, you're so right!

1743
01:25:54,810 --> 01:25:56,310
He just hasn't found it yet.

1744
01:25:56,450 --> 01:25:59,830
I shall awaken the beauty inside him, guys.

1745
01:26:00,390 --> 01:26:02,850
I shall be his beauty awakening.

1746
01:26:03,890 --> 01:26:05,730
Candid, thank you for the super chat.

1747
01:26:05,810 --> 01:26:06,970
Thank you, thank you.

1748
01:26:06,970 --> 01:26:17,090
It's extra funny because historical Zhang Yi was a puff-bearded badass and one of the most OP...

1749
01:26:17,090 --> 01:26:18,570
Okay, that's pretty funny.

1750
01:26:19,930 --> 01:26:24,990
Where the fuck did Dynasty Warriors' Zhang Yi come from then?

1751
01:26:27,630 --> 01:26:29,010
Oh my god.

1752
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:31,550
Like, how is that... where did that come from?

1753
01:26:31,930 --> 01:26:33,990
Okay, so you guys said I can do like...

1754
01:26:36,390 --> 01:26:37,870
Wait, what does it say?

1755
01:26:37,990 --> 01:26:38,870
Recommend battle level?

1756
01:26:38,930 --> 01:26:40,650
I am not there yet.

1757
01:26:40,790 --> 01:26:43,810
You guys said I could technically do the other ones.

1758
01:26:44,190 --> 01:26:45,410
It doesn't matter.

1759
01:26:45,610 --> 01:26:49,470
So like, I'm gonna do the other battles then.

1760
01:26:51,770 --> 01:26:54,970
His inner beauty is gonna come out, right guys?

1761
01:26:56,730 --> 01:26:57,530
That's right.

1762
01:26:57,710 --> 01:26:58,730
Oh wait, I didn't unlock this.

1763
01:26:59,130 --> 01:27:01,310
Oh my god, there's some...

1764
01:27:01,310 --> 01:27:03,170
He just made it!

1765
01:27:06,230 --> 01:27:07,230
They just...

1766
01:27:07,230 --> 01:27:14,010
Thank you for the superchat, thank you, thank you.

1767
01:27:14,090 --> 01:27:16,670
They just... they're just like, you know what?

1768
01:27:16,730 --> 01:27:19,230
We need someone flamboyant in our game.

1769
01:27:19,530 --> 01:27:21,910
Let's just rewrite history.

1770
01:27:23,070 --> 01:27:24,190
Source myself.

1771
01:27:26,150 --> 01:27:29,030
It was just a really good design, guys.

1772
01:27:29,090 --> 01:27:30,370
They didn't want to waste it.

1773
01:27:30,370 --> 01:27:34,050
They just assigned a random design to it, guys.

1774
01:27:34,090 --> 01:27:36,090
It was just such a good design.

1775
01:27:36,690 --> 01:27:39,950
It would be careless to waste such an opportunity.

1776
01:27:40,490 --> 01:27:41,850
I wanna do a...

1777
01:27:41,850 --> 01:27:44,530
I wanna do a...

1778
01:27:44,530 --> 01:27:46,690
Wei or Wu mission.

1779
01:27:52,250 --> 01:27:54,950
That's absolutely... that's so funny.

1780
01:27:55,730 --> 01:27:58,290
They just made it up!

1781
01:27:58,290 --> 01:28:00,990
That's so fucking funny.

1782
01:28:01,350 --> 01:28:02,930
Oh shit, it's level 14?

1783
01:28:03,050 --> 01:28:04,390
Let's fucking do this one.

1784
01:28:06,190 --> 01:28:10,290
Oh wait, Zhang He's name in Japanese is Butterfly, so they're like...

1785
01:28:12,110 --> 01:28:17,430
Imagine like... like... 200 years in the future, your name is like...

1786
01:28:18,690 --> 01:28:23,230
You're just like... your name is just... reminds me of a butterfly.

1787
01:28:24,770 --> 01:28:25,850
So funny.

1788
01:28:27,850 --> 01:28:30,230
Historical inaccuracy in my...

1789
01:28:30,230 --> 01:28:37,190
Like, you were like one of the best generals in your land, and you're like...

1790
01:28:37,190 --> 01:28:39,970
I wonder what will history say about me.

1791
01:28:41,270 --> 01:28:42,070
Like...

1792
01:28:42,070 --> 01:28:43,710
Imagine that.

1793
01:28:44,450 --> 01:28:46,310
They're just like, man...

1794
01:28:46,310 --> 01:28:52,190
I hope... I hope my... I hope my descendants talk about the amount of...

1795
01:28:52,190 --> 01:28:55,370
The amount of things I've done for my country.

1796
01:28:55,570 --> 01:28:58,310
And then they turned you into a flamboyant...

1797
01:29:00,170 --> 01:29:00,770
Flamboyant...

1798
01:29:01,650 --> 01:29:05,050
This is your entire personality now.

1799
01:29:05,850 --> 01:29:08,070
That's abs... that's crazy.

1800
01:29:08,150 --> 01:29:09,270
That's so funny.

1801
01:29:13,050 --> 01:29:14,050
Alright, nice.

1802
01:29:14,490 --> 01:29:15,890
Okay, finish one of the objectives.

1803
01:29:15,970 --> 01:29:16,630
What did I finish?

1804
01:29:16,730 --> 01:29:19,170
I did the 500 foes.

1805
01:29:19,610 --> 01:29:21,530
And then...

1806
01:29:21,530 --> 01:29:22,390
Spear training.

1807
01:29:22,650 --> 01:29:23,290
Which one do I mean?

1808
01:29:23,470 --> 01:29:25,650
Okay, using... Okay, I just didn't use battle arts.

1809
01:29:26,690 --> 01:29:27,410
There we go.

1810
01:29:28,530 --> 01:29:30,230
This is your legacy now.

1811
01:29:30,550 --> 01:29:31,170
That's abs...

1812
01:29:31,170 --> 01:29:33,930
This is your legacy now!

1813
01:29:34,230 --> 01:29:36,030
Oh my god!

1814
01:29:37,410 --> 01:29:38,490
That's crazy.

1815
01:29:38,490 --> 01:29:39,530
That's your legacy.

1816
01:29:40,910 --> 01:29:42,850
Like, Lu Bu...

1817
01:29:42,850 --> 01:29:46,310
Lu Bu gets like a whole fucking arc about him.

1818
01:29:47,270 --> 01:29:48,590
I mean...

1819
01:29:48,590 --> 01:29:52,910
Deserved, really, because he was like one of the strongest men in ancient China.

1820
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:57,570
And then Zhang He, who was like a great general for his faction.

1821
01:29:58,210 --> 01:30:02,010
And like was buffed and trained every day and killed so many people.

1822
01:30:02,530 --> 01:30:04,650
And then the developers were like...

1823
01:30:05,170 --> 01:30:06,650
Your name sounds like a butterfly.

1824
01:30:11,410 --> 01:30:14,870
It was like, let's make up your story.

1825
01:30:19,490 --> 01:30:20,490
Poor guy.

1826
01:30:25,230 --> 01:30:26,090
I like that.

1827
01:30:26,270 --> 01:30:28,710
To be fair, I like that version of Zhang He.

1828
01:30:31,450 --> 01:30:34,330
I like the dynasty warriors, Zhang He.

1829
01:30:34,390 --> 01:30:35,090
I'm sorry.

1830
01:30:37,130 --> 01:30:37,630
Nice.

1831
01:30:38,290 --> 01:30:38,650
Easy.

1832
01:30:39,690 --> 01:30:41,170
I'll just take this base real quick.

1833
01:30:41,330 --> 01:30:41,770
You know what?

1834
01:30:41,790 --> 01:30:43,110
You can fire some arrows.

1835
01:30:43,430 --> 01:30:45,110
Silly, silly guys.

1836
01:30:46,670 --> 01:30:47,550
Alright, nice.

1837
01:30:48,190 --> 01:30:49,050
Oh, wait.

1838
01:30:49,090 --> 01:30:49,890
It was just that easy.

1839
01:30:50,110 --> 01:30:50,350
Nice.

1840
01:30:51,410 --> 01:30:54,650
How much more do I have to do for this one?

1841
01:30:55,410 --> 01:30:56,810
Oh, I just need ten more.

1842
01:30:57,150 --> 01:30:57,730
Alright, nice.

1843
01:30:58,550 --> 01:30:59,450
Beauty is strength.

1844
01:31:01,130 --> 01:31:05,410
This is why you keep it in your will.

1845
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:09,170
In your will, just right in there.

1846
01:31:09,270 --> 01:31:11,430
Do not make up character traits.

1847
01:31:12,270 --> 01:31:18,050
If I ever get put in a dynasty warriors game, please don't make up my story.

1848
01:31:20,850 --> 01:31:21,970
Okay, nice.

1849
01:31:22,070 --> 01:31:23,430
I finished it.

1850
01:31:25,650 --> 01:31:26,210
Nice.

1851
01:31:26,490 --> 01:31:26,830
Easy.

1852
01:31:27,510 --> 01:31:29,530
And we have two more bases left.

1853
01:31:30,170 --> 01:31:30,450
Alright.

1854
01:31:31,450 --> 01:31:33,350
Okay, we finished that.

1855
01:31:33,730 --> 01:31:33,950
You know what?

1856
01:31:34,110 --> 01:31:34,490
Let's...

1857
01:31:34,490 --> 01:31:37,430
We don't need to do Lu Bu stuff because we technically...

1858
01:31:37,430 --> 01:31:41,730
We technically finished all of his because we did pay to win.

1859
01:31:42,230 --> 01:31:43,630
So, I guess we can...

1860
01:31:43,630 --> 01:31:44,530
We can do...

1861
01:31:45,630 --> 01:31:46,150
Yeah,

1862
01:31:56,410 --> 01:32:00,870
we maxed out Lu Bu.

1863
01:32:01,930 --> 01:32:02,910
I'm pretty sure.

1864
01:32:05,890 --> 01:32:09,270
You know damn well I'm not doing it for the skill points.

1865
01:32:12,990 --> 01:32:19,130
Guys, you know damn well we are not doing this for the skill points.

1866
01:32:20,210 --> 01:32:24,290
We're doing it for something more important than that.

1867
01:32:26,510 --> 01:32:28,590
Okay, we'll use the Twin Peaks.

1868
01:32:30,690 --> 01:32:32,430
Oh wait, can I not change it?

1869
01:32:32,490 --> 01:32:33,490
I should be able to change it now.

1870
01:32:33,570 --> 01:32:34,070
I stopped.

1871
01:32:35,390 --> 01:32:37,070
Okay, I should have a... 89.

1872
01:32:37,450 --> 01:32:37,890
There you go.

1873
01:32:38,590 --> 01:32:39,010
Nice.

1874
01:32:39,170 --> 01:32:39,330
Alright.

1875
01:32:40,170 --> 01:32:41,690
Let's go grab the other base.

1876
01:32:46,890 --> 01:32:51,550
It is absolutely not for the skill points.

1877
01:32:53,590 --> 01:32:53,810
Okay.

1878
01:32:56,170 --> 01:32:56,890
Nice.

1879
01:32:58,030 --> 01:32:58,750
Okay.

1880
01:32:59,350 --> 01:33:01,130
Yeah, you think you can do anything?

1881
01:33:01,130 --> 01:33:04,230
Oh my god, I hope he fucking eats some bread real quick.

1882
01:33:05,810 --> 01:33:08,750
Jesus, this weapon is so slow though.

1883
01:33:08,970 --> 01:33:12,090
I'm not a fan of how slow this weapon is.

1884
01:33:15,070 --> 01:33:16,470
Jesus, why are you running?

1885
01:33:17,470 --> 01:33:18,770
Why the fuck are you running?

1886
01:33:20,650 --> 01:33:22,830
Hey, you started this fight.

1887
01:33:24,390 --> 01:33:26,910
You fucking started this fight, buddy.

1888
01:33:29,690 --> 01:33:31,250
Yeah, this is my area.

1889
01:33:31,670 --> 01:33:32,630
Oh, we won.

1890
01:33:32,790 --> 01:33:33,450
I did it.

1891
01:33:35,810 --> 01:33:38,050
The AI won the game for me.

1892
01:33:38,110 --> 01:33:38,670
Let's go.

1893
01:33:39,670 --> 01:33:40,030
Yay!

1894
01:33:43,290 --> 01:33:44,950
I don't know if I like the Twin Peaks.

1895
01:33:45,010 --> 01:33:46,130
It's such a slow weapon.

1896
01:33:46,470 --> 01:33:48,330
Which one's the best one so far?

1897
01:33:48,850 --> 01:33:49,950
Is it still the wheels?

1898
01:33:50,490 --> 01:33:52,530
Is the wheels still the best weapon in this game?

1899
01:33:54,790 --> 01:33:55,930
It feels like it.

1900
01:33:56,990 --> 01:33:57,810
Okay, nice.

1901
01:33:58,010 --> 01:33:59,090
Unlock new skill panel.

1902
01:34:01,850 --> 01:34:02,930
Yay, birch!

1903
01:34:03,910 --> 01:34:05,590
You're stronger now!

1904
01:34:05,810 --> 01:34:06,630
Okay, the wheels.

1905
01:34:06,790 --> 01:34:08,290
Okay, I like the wheels the most.

1906
01:34:09,430 --> 01:34:09,930
Nice.

1907
01:34:12,170 --> 01:34:13,650
I got two sphere trainings.

1908
01:34:13,810 --> 01:34:14,550
I got that.

1909
01:34:15,670 --> 01:34:17,210
97 skill points.

1910
01:34:18,430 --> 01:34:18,930
Yay!

1911
01:34:19,910 --> 01:34:20,970
Okay, let's upgrade.

1912
01:34:21,290 --> 01:34:23,890
Let's just do it by... I'm just gonna do it by the order.

1913
01:34:27,010 --> 01:34:29,630
Oh, I haven't unlocked ultimate battle arts?

1914
01:34:34,270 --> 01:34:36,250
Okay, and then... Oh wait, there we go.

1915
01:34:36,350 --> 01:34:37,430
I wanted to do...

1916
01:34:37,950 --> 01:34:42,110
I wanted to do theirs because we can't do all of them for now.

1917
01:34:43,630 --> 01:34:44,830
Sun Jian's headquarters.

1918
01:34:54,020 --> 01:34:54,980
Oh, sorry.

1919
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:56,200
I accidentally interrupted him.

1920
01:35:12,630 --> 01:35:13,810
Shall you say?

1921
01:35:14,050 --> 01:35:16,130
I was definitely not there a moment ago.

1922
01:35:22,130 --> 01:35:23,950
I know he's still alive!

1923
01:35:24,150 --> 01:35:25,110
It's crazy!

1924
01:35:26,530 --> 01:35:31,030
This is the longest I've ever seen him alive in any Dynasty Warriors game.

1925
01:35:31,630 --> 01:35:34,250
By the time you play as him to stop your death.

1926
01:35:47,650 --> 01:35:48,770
Of course!

1927
01:35:54,690 --> 01:35:57,390
I haven't seen any of his sons yet.

1928
01:35:58,230 --> 01:36:01,710
None of his sons are still around.

1929
01:36:02,550 --> 01:36:04,310
Where is your bad mission?

1930
01:36:07,310 --> 01:36:10,310
Who the fuck is this mission?

1931
01:36:12,450 --> 01:36:13,890
Is it back here?

1932
01:36:14,290 --> 01:36:16,110
No, that's the new base thing, right?

1933
01:36:18,770 --> 01:36:20,190
No, that's the shop.

1934
01:36:20,310 --> 01:36:20,790
Nevermind.

1935
01:36:22,330 --> 01:36:23,470
That's the shop.

1936
01:36:24,170 --> 01:36:25,130
I'm so broke.

1937
01:36:25,130 --> 01:36:27,410
I have no money.

1938
01:36:28,150 --> 01:36:30,010
I have no money.

1939
01:36:30,610 --> 01:36:31,710
Oh, there's a fisherman.

1940
01:36:32,110 --> 01:36:33,550
Wait, I can't cross it.

1941
01:36:33,650 --> 01:36:34,010
No!

1942
01:36:35,970 --> 01:36:38,430
I wanna talk to the fisherman.

1943
01:36:39,010 --> 01:36:40,570
Where the fuck is the battle?

1944
01:36:41,490 --> 01:36:42,590
I'm so lost.

1945
01:36:43,810 --> 01:36:45,370
Nanyang, Yu province.

1946
01:36:45,730 --> 01:36:46,490
Was it this one?

1947
01:36:49,370 --> 01:36:50,630
I don't remember.

1948
01:36:50,990 --> 01:36:53,670
I don't remember, guys.

1949
01:36:54,490 --> 01:36:55,550
Was it this?

1950
01:36:58,390 --> 01:37:01,430
Oh my god, I'm so lost in all the battles.

1951
01:37:01,570 --> 01:37:02,690
Is it this one?

1952
01:37:03,710 --> 01:37:05,090
Oh yeah, I saw Nanyang.

1953
01:37:05,290 --> 01:37:05,850
There it is.

1954
01:37:06,530 --> 01:37:07,390
Sun Jian's forces.

1955
01:37:08,130 --> 01:37:08,910
There we go.

1956
01:37:12,830 --> 01:37:13,870
Hello, Sun Jian.

1957
01:37:16,270 --> 01:37:18,270
Can I fill up all the bubbles?

1958
01:37:18,550 --> 01:37:23,650
Can I still do all the bubbles for everybody?

1959
01:37:23,970 --> 01:37:28,390
Or is it like I just do it not until the last?

1960
01:37:28,450 --> 01:37:29,670
Okay, I can fill up all of them.

1961
01:37:29,670 --> 01:37:29,950
Okay.

1962
01:37:38,090 --> 01:37:39,490
Okay.

1963
01:37:39,490 --> 01:37:41,490
Okay.

1964
01:37:45,810 --> 01:37:47,210
Okay.

1965
01:37:58,850 --> 01:37:59,990
Fair enough.

1966
01:38:04,430 --> 01:38:05,550
I just gotta go in a straight path.

1967
01:38:07,310 --> 01:38:08,590
Leave it to me.

1968
01:38:10,310 --> 01:38:11,770
Alright, Huang Gai.

1969
01:38:11,990 --> 01:38:13,630
Okay, we'll get Huang Gai in here.

1970
01:38:13,910 --> 01:38:14,790
It's not the same.

1971
01:38:15,170 --> 01:38:23,290
The thing I don't like about Sun Jian's army is that they don't really have a lot of generals that I like for me.

1972
01:38:24,390 --> 01:38:26,010
Like, I hate all his sons.

1973
01:38:26,830 --> 01:38:29,410
Okay, hate is a strong word.

1974
01:38:29,870 --> 01:38:32,710
But I'm not a fan of any of his sons.

1975
01:38:33,570 --> 01:38:37,810
And the only one I like is...

1976
01:38:37,810 --> 01:38:38,830
I love his... okay.

1977
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:41,110
You're his one fan.

1978
01:38:45,930 --> 01:38:48,610
You're literally his one fan.

1979
01:38:49,270 --> 01:38:58,830
But for me, the only person I like in his army, his generals, is Sun Xianxian and Gan Ning.

1980
01:38:59,050 --> 01:39:01,150
That's the only ones I like in his army.

1981
01:39:01,770 --> 01:39:03,630
For his generals.

1982
01:39:09,070 --> 01:39:10,150
And Sun Jian.

1983
01:39:10,330 --> 01:39:11,350
But then they killed him off.

1984
01:39:11,590 --> 01:39:12,730
Not even Zhou Yu.

1985
01:39:13,570 --> 01:39:17,190
There's so many Zhou Yu's in all the other factions.

1986
01:39:18,130 --> 01:39:19,230
Like, have a Zhou Yu.

1987
01:39:21,770 --> 01:39:22,290
Guys.

1988
01:39:23,990 --> 01:39:25,710
They all have a Zhou Yu.

1989
01:39:29,410 --> 01:39:31,390
They all have a Zhou Yu.

1990
01:39:31,550 --> 01:39:33,070
It was not that special.

1991
01:39:35,590 --> 01:39:36,110
Okay,

1992
01:39:39,450 --> 01:39:40,270
we can kill him fast.

1993
01:39:42,190 --> 01:39:48,170
Wei has exactly... Wei has like 8 Zhou Yu's if you think about it.

1994
01:39:49,570 --> 01:39:51,530
Oh shit, that's not what I wanted to do.

1995
01:39:53,430 --> 01:39:54,110
There we go.

1996
01:39:58,190 --> 01:40:02,590
If you think about it, Shu had like 10 of Zhou Yu.

1997
01:40:07,850 --> 01:40:08,890
That's what I'm saying.

1998
01:40:08,990 --> 01:40:11,630
The only ones I like was Gan Ning and Sun Xianxian.

1999
01:40:12,090 --> 01:40:13,790
That was the only one I like.

2000
01:40:15,150 --> 01:40:21,170
Like, we literally have like Zhao Yun and Shu, which is practically a Zhou Yu.

2001
01:40:26,130 --> 01:40:26,950
Okay, nice.

2002
01:40:27,050 --> 01:40:28,070
Oh, what the fuck?

2003
01:40:28,230 --> 01:40:28,690
Not nice.

2004
01:40:30,430 --> 01:40:30,910
True.

2005
01:40:33,650 --> 01:40:35,130
Get out of here.

2006
01:40:39,090 --> 01:40:40,610
Alright, open the door!

2007
01:40:41,330 --> 01:40:42,570
Open the door!

2008
01:40:45,970 --> 01:40:47,430
Am I breaking the door myself?

2009
01:40:47,590 --> 01:40:48,130
No, I'm waiting.

2010
01:40:48,310 --> 01:40:49,510
I was like, am I doing it?

2011
01:40:51,730 --> 01:40:52,410
You're right.

2012
01:40:52,490 --> 01:40:54,810
The best part were their wives and I didn't even remember.

2013
01:40:54,890 --> 01:40:57,110
But the thing is, I didn't even remember the wives.

2014
01:41:04,130 --> 01:41:05,430
The best part?

2015
01:41:05,790 --> 01:41:11,950
The best part of Sun Xian's forces were the women.

2016
01:41:12,290 --> 01:41:12,710
You're right.

2017
01:41:12,810 --> 01:41:13,530
No, absolutely.

2018
01:41:13,530 --> 01:41:18,650
The women that weren't actually like... like the two girls.

2019
01:41:19,370 --> 01:41:19,370
Wait.

2020
01:41:19,790 --> 01:41:21,870
Yeah, they were the women in there.

2021
01:41:21,950 --> 01:41:22,130
Yeah.

2022
01:41:22,370 --> 01:41:23,270
No, you're right.

2023
01:41:23,330 --> 01:41:23,830
Absolutely.

2024
01:41:29,030 --> 01:41:30,610
Alright, let's go.

2025
01:41:31,550 --> 01:41:32,870
Conquer another base.

2026
01:41:35,690 --> 01:41:37,350
Oh shit, what the fuck?

2027
01:41:37,730 --> 01:41:39,050
Do you know who I am?

2028
01:41:39,630 --> 01:41:40,670
Get out of here.

2029
01:41:41,810 --> 01:41:43,250
Get out of here!

2030
01:41:45,050 --> 01:41:46,310
Okay, nice.

2031
01:41:46,390 --> 01:41:47,550
I completed new boost training.

2032
01:41:49,530 --> 01:41:50,550
Get out!

2033
01:41:54,530 --> 01:41:56,250
Okay, let's get him out of here.

2034
01:41:56,790 --> 01:41:57,370
You know what?

2035
01:41:57,550 --> 01:41:58,070
Fuck it.

2036
01:42:00,030 --> 01:42:01,030
Alright, guards!

2037
01:42:01,390 --> 01:42:01,990
DRAGONS!

2038
01:42:02,070 --> 01:42:03,310
SHOOT THAT ARROW!

2039
01:42:07,350 --> 01:42:09,150
That's fucking right, get out!

2040
01:42:10,670 --> 01:42:11,150
Easy.

2041
01:42:12,770 --> 01:42:13,730
GO DRAGONS!

2042
01:42:13,790 --> 01:42:14,750
FOR DOKI!

2043
01:42:16,950 --> 01:42:17,830
Wait, there's one more.

2044
01:42:17,970 --> 01:42:18,490
What the fuck?

2045
01:42:18,490 --> 01:42:19,390
Where did he come from?

2046
01:42:21,930 --> 01:42:23,470
I was like, where did you come from?

2047
01:42:28,670 --> 01:42:29,570
Jesus, okay.

2048
01:42:29,810 --> 01:42:32,530
It's not fair that he could interrupt that.

2049
01:42:33,230 --> 01:42:34,050
I'm like, hello?

2050
01:42:34,230 --> 01:42:36,430
I am trying to shoot my thing.

2051
01:42:36,430 --> 01:42:40,390
Hello, open the door.

2052
01:42:40,770 --> 01:42:41,630
Oh yeah!

2053
01:42:42,690 --> 01:42:43,390
Yeah!

2054
01:42:45,240 --> 01:42:45,590
Yeah!

2055
01:42:46,610 --> 01:42:48,010
Alright, nice.

2056
01:42:52,530 --> 01:42:53,890
Get out of here.

2057
01:42:57,670 --> 01:42:58,630
That's right.

2058
01:42:58,770 --> 01:43:01,650
You think you can interrupt my attack?

2059
01:43:01,950 --> 01:43:02,930
Get out of here!

2060
01:43:04,030 --> 01:43:04,390
Yeah!

2061
01:43:05,750 --> 01:43:06,390
Okay, nice.

2062
01:43:06,530 --> 01:43:07,810
My proficiency has increased.

2063
01:43:11,330 --> 01:43:14,430
I didn't need to do that, but I just did it just for fun.

2064
01:43:15,770 --> 01:43:16,990
Wait, is there a general in here?

2065
01:43:17,130 --> 01:43:17,930
Oh, there is!

2066
01:43:19,170 --> 01:43:21,070
I was like, why is this taking so long?

2067
01:43:21,170 --> 01:43:22,190
There is a general here.

2068
01:43:24,110 --> 01:43:24,370
Okay.

2069
01:43:25,830 --> 01:43:26,470
That's fine.

2070
01:43:27,670 --> 01:43:28,230
There we go.

2071
01:43:28,330 --> 01:43:28,950
General's dead.

2072
01:43:29,850 --> 01:43:30,530
Alright, let's leave.

2073
01:43:32,930 --> 01:43:34,030
We did it, let's leave.

2074
01:43:34,650 --> 01:43:35,910
Open the gates!

2075
01:43:38,010 --> 01:43:40,230
Wait, there's more reinforcements?

2076
01:43:45,730 --> 01:43:46,590
That's fine.

2077
01:43:49,250 --> 01:43:50,130
You'll be fine.

2078
01:43:52,090 --> 01:43:53,430
And how do I...

2079
01:43:53,430 --> 01:43:55,250
Okay, jump up.

2080
01:43:56,170 --> 01:43:57,750
Wait, they can just do that?

2081
01:43:58,950 --> 01:43:59,430
What?

2082
01:44:01,990 --> 01:44:02,730
That's fine.

2083
01:44:04,970 --> 01:44:05,990
I can do this.

2084
01:44:07,290 --> 01:44:08,170
There we go.

2085
01:44:09,630 --> 01:44:10,410
What's going on?

2086
01:44:10,690 --> 01:44:12,490
Oh, I did this before the cutscene.

2087
01:44:17,710 --> 01:44:19,490
Oh shit, is this where he dies?

2088
01:44:20,710 --> 01:44:21,370
Guys!

2089
01:44:25,370 --> 01:44:26,530
Wait, where's me?

2090
01:44:26,650 --> 01:44:27,670
I was just there!

2091
01:44:28,450 --> 01:44:30,230
I literally made the first opening!

2092
01:44:34,230 --> 01:44:35,870
Oh shit, his son!

2093
01:44:37,310 --> 01:44:39,630
Wait, he uses his fists now?

2094
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:48,180
Wait, what happened to...

2095
01:44:48,180 --> 01:44:50,380
Wait, what happened to his other weapon?

2096
01:44:50,980 --> 01:44:51,640
The sticks!

2097
01:44:52,100 --> 01:44:53,060
The tonfa!

2098
01:44:56,040 --> 01:44:57,600
Bro became a fister.

2099
01:44:57,860 --> 01:44:59,220
Wait, is he gonna punch the arrow?

2100
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:01,020
Oh, it's the other son!

2101
01:45:01,880 --> 01:45:03,200
No, it's Zhou Yu!

2102
01:45:08,720 --> 01:45:09,820
Wait, what the fuck?

2103
01:45:09,880 --> 01:45:10,980
He's using the staff?

2104
01:45:14,540 --> 01:45:15,440
Oh, it's him.

2105
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:23,480
Wait, when did he used to be a sword user?

2106
01:45:30,060 --> 01:45:31,880
Wait, did he have a staff since 7?

2107
01:45:32,140 --> 01:45:34,920
I liked him when he... I forgot about that.

2108
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:39,460
I personally liked his sword better.

2109
01:45:41,460 --> 01:45:43,460
Guys, she hasn't finished...

2110
01:45:43,460 --> 01:45:46,180
No, she's like... what is she in like historically wise?

2111
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:47,440
I forgot.

2112
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:50,380
She should not be in war right now.

2113
01:45:50,540 --> 01:45:55,900
What I do know is that she should not be in battle right now.

2114
01:45:59,620 --> 01:46:00,180
Okay.

2115
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:03,280
Nice.

2116
01:46:04,100 --> 01:46:05,180
Nice, Sun Jian!

2117
01:46:06,140 --> 01:46:08,940
Extreme by Pio when the swap gauges are out?

2118
01:46:13,560 --> 01:46:14,160
Okay.

2119
01:46:15,160 --> 01:46:16,780
Wait, what are they doing here?

2120
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:18,900
Why are they behind me?

2121
01:46:19,180 --> 01:46:19,940
You guys are idiots.

2122
01:46:24,240 --> 01:46:25,240
Okay, nice.

2123
01:46:26,660 --> 01:46:28,020
Alright, we got it.

2124
01:46:29,420 --> 01:46:30,940
Get through the gates!

2125
01:46:32,160 --> 01:46:33,000
Let's go!

2126
01:46:33,140 --> 01:46:34,580
Let's use it on these guys!

2127
01:46:36,060 --> 01:46:36,900
Oh my god.

2128
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:37,920
Oh my...

2129
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:38,340
Woah!

2130
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:42,780
He's still 9, Doki.

2131
01:46:42,900 --> 01:46:43,980
That hasn't changed.

2132
01:46:46,720 --> 01:46:48,140
Doki, that has not changed.

2133
01:46:48,240 --> 01:46:49,340
She's still 9.

2134
01:46:49,720 --> 01:46:51,800
What is she doing in the battlefield?

2135
01:46:53,360 --> 01:46:55,420
Get out of here, Sun Jian!

2136
01:46:58,760 --> 01:46:59,240
Okay.

2137
01:47:00,100 --> 01:47:00,580
Nice.

2138
01:47:01,200 --> 01:47:02,720
Oh my god, he's so strong.

2139
01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:05,580
Bro, that's cheating.

2140
01:47:06,300 --> 01:47:07,960
Oh my god, I did not see my HP.

2141
01:47:08,100 --> 01:47:09,760
I did not realize how low I was.

2142
01:47:11,960 --> 01:47:12,800
Nice counter.

2143
01:47:17,780 --> 01:47:18,960
Get out.

2144
01:47:23,340 --> 01:47:24,400
Come on.

2145
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:26,440
Let me fight you!

2146
01:47:27,960 --> 01:47:28,940
Okay, nice.

2147
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:30,700
Get out!

2148
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:35,340
Oh my god, you're too spongy.

2149
01:47:35,740 --> 01:47:42,340
The only thing I... Also, another critique is that so many of the generals are so spongy now.

2150
01:47:48,440 --> 01:47:49,220
Let's go.

2151
01:47:49,680 --> 01:47:50,880
Alright, let's go.

2152
01:47:52,700 --> 01:47:54,140
We gotta move forward.

2153
01:47:56,320 --> 01:47:57,920
We gotta go this way.

2154
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:06,940
Alright, open the door!

2155
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:08,500
Let's go!

2156
01:48:09,780 --> 01:48:12,720
Yeah, but I feel like they're way too spongy.

2157
01:48:12,940 --> 01:48:17,180
I think if they toned down the sponginess, I think it would be better.

2158
01:48:18,660 --> 01:48:23,880
Some of them are like... I don't think default man should be that spongy.

2159
01:48:24,420 --> 01:48:24,720
You know?

2160
01:48:27,540 --> 01:48:28,100
Spin!

2161
01:48:32,940 --> 01:48:33,500
Okay.

2162
01:48:33,780 --> 01:48:34,120
What?

2163
01:48:34,760 --> 01:48:35,160
What?

2164
01:48:35,460 --> 01:48:36,320
Alright, that's it.

2165
01:48:36,420 --> 01:48:37,000
I'm angry.

2166
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:38,740
DRAGONS, GO!

2167
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:46,000
Like, if you don't have a skin, you should be faster to kill.

2168
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:49,400
Nice.

2169
01:48:50,180 --> 01:48:51,140
My base now.

2170
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:56,680
Alright, open the door!

2171
01:48:59,540 --> 01:49:00,180
Let's go.

2172
01:49:00,820 --> 01:49:02,220
Guys, this is actually crazy.

2173
01:49:02,360 --> 01:49:04,100
This is like the most...

2174
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:09,380
The most, like, we've ever progressed in the game.

2175
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:11,220
The last three games, guys.

2176
01:49:11,260 --> 01:49:12,500
The last three parts.

2177
01:49:14,840 --> 01:49:20,180
If you think about it, this is actually the most we've ever progressed in the...

2178
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:26,780
We actually are doing two... We did like three fights, guys.

2179
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:27,600
It's crazy.

2180
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:29,900
Wait, no, this is our fourth fight!

2181
01:49:30,220 --> 01:49:31,600
Oh my god.

2182
01:49:32,900 --> 01:49:34,280
We're doing it, guys.

2183
01:49:34,360 --> 01:49:36,360
We're actually progressing the story.

2184
01:49:39,940 --> 01:49:40,980
Open the door.

2185
01:49:44,460 --> 01:49:45,400
Open the door!

2186
01:49:47,960 --> 01:49:49,600
Wait, am I supposed to be back there?

2187
01:49:53,900 --> 01:49:55,540
No, I don't think so.

2188
01:49:55,540 --> 01:49:56,860
No way.

2189
01:49:58,520 --> 01:49:59,680
Okay, nice.

2190
01:50:02,220 --> 01:50:02,820
That's right.

2191
01:50:04,580 --> 01:50:05,340
Interrupt.

2192
01:50:12,600 --> 01:50:14,560
Get out of here!

2193
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:16,440
That's fucking right!

2194
01:50:17,480 --> 01:50:18,300
I'm him!

2195
01:50:19,820 --> 01:50:20,880
Is there another boss?

2196
01:50:20,980 --> 01:50:21,180
No.

2197
01:50:21,320 --> 01:50:22,480
Okay, my base now.

2198
01:50:24,460 --> 01:50:26,340
Alright, let's see if there's any objectives.

2199
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:28,400
Okay, complete a Lu Bu's objective.

2200
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:30,780
Using Musou attacks.

2201
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:32,480
Launch a successful...

2202
01:50:33,540 --> 01:50:37,340
Where's the other one with... Wait, where's the other one with the Twin Peaks?

2203
01:50:38,280 --> 01:50:40,060
Finish a combo with Enhance.

2204
01:50:40,660 --> 01:50:42,340
Okay, I was not doing that.

2205
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:46,600
Wait, I did none of that?

2206
01:50:47,420 --> 01:50:48,220
Wait, what?

2207
01:50:48,900 --> 01:50:49,380
Okay.

2208
01:50:50,220 --> 01:50:54,300
Clearly, I was not doing my objective, guys.

2209
01:50:54,840 --> 01:50:55,140
Whoops.

2210
01:50:58,320 --> 01:50:59,000
Oops.

2211
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,100
I thought I was!

2212
01:51:02,420 --> 01:51:04,200
Okay, I just need to press Y.

2213
01:51:07,040 --> 01:51:08,420
Just press Y.

2214
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:10,360
I can do that.

2215
01:51:15,140 --> 01:51:15,540
Okay.

2216
01:51:15,540 --> 01:51:18,180
Get the pause in Strong Cat when the pikes light up?

2217
01:51:18,280 --> 01:51:19,460
I have to pause?

2218
01:51:21,200 --> 01:51:22,600
Oh my- I'm just gonna pay.

2219
01:51:22,680 --> 01:51:23,680
Fuck it, I'm just gonna pay.

2220
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:31,760
Oh, you think- What the fuck?!

2221
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:32,800
How do I- Okay.

2222
01:51:35,140 --> 01:51:35,540
Wait.

2223
01:51:40,360 --> 01:51:41,820
You can't shoot me from here.

2224
01:51:41,980 --> 01:51:43,220
That's fine.

2225
01:51:43,640 --> 01:51:45,100
That's fine.

2226
01:51:45,580 --> 01:51:46,800
Rude Force, baby!

2227
01:51:47,700 --> 01:51:48,920
Rude Force!

2228
01:51:51,420 --> 01:51:53,440
That's fucking right!

2229
01:51:55,820 --> 01:51:57,220
Rude Force!

2230
01:52:01,620 --> 01:52:02,620
Yes!

2231
01:52:04,100 --> 01:52:05,740
That's right!

2232
01:52:06,340 --> 01:52:09,660
Rude Force is the way to go.

2233
01:52:10,580 --> 01:52:12,340
That's fucking right!

2234
01:52:14,140 --> 01:52:16,580
I love Rude Forcing things!

2235
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:22,100
Eventually, it'll work!

2236
01:52:24,300 --> 01:52:26,400
Nice, we did it.

2237
01:52:27,800 --> 01:52:28,840
Tactical genius!

2238
01:52:29,640 --> 01:52:31,340
I was like, wait, what do I do?

2239
01:52:31,480 --> 01:52:32,760
Oh, I'll just keep going forward.

2240
01:52:32,860 --> 01:52:34,220
It'll work eventually, right?

2241
01:52:34,220 --> 01:52:34,260
Right?

2242
01:52:39,280 --> 01:52:39,720
Nice.

2243
01:52:40,420 --> 01:52:41,340
See, guys?

2244
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:43,520
Eventually, it'll work.

2245
01:52:44,620 --> 01:52:45,240
Oh, nice.

2246
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:45,620
Alright.

2247
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:46,800
Alright, Dracoons.

2248
01:52:47,180 --> 01:52:48,740
FIRE ARROWS!

2249
01:52:53,810 --> 01:52:55,310
That's fucking right, get counted!

2250
01:52:56,790 --> 01:52:58,690
I'm gonna do this thing!

2251
01:52:59,490 --> 01:53:00,290
Oh, nice, he's dead.

2252
01:53:00,350 --> 01:53:01,170
Oh, wait, no, he's not.

2253
01:53:02,110 --> 01:53:03,650
Okay, I need to get closer to him.

2254
01:53:04,110 --> 01:53:04,470
There we go.

2255
01:53:05,970 --> 01:53:07,310
Oh, thank you for the raid!

2256
01:53:07,450 --> 01:53:08,430
Thank you, thank you!

2257
01:53:08,950 --> 01:53:11,030
I didn't see who raided, but thank you so much!

2258
01:53:12,190 --> 01:53:13,090
That's fucking right.

2259
01:53:14,210 --> 01:53:15,330
Get twirled on!

2260
01:53:16,970 --> 01:53:20,650
Okay, I'll use my- wait, I can change characters, but I'm gonna use it later.

2261
01:53:20,730 --> 01:53:21,950
I'm gonna use it at the final boss.

2262
01:53:24,370 --> 01:53:25,050
There we go.

2263
01:53:27,690 --> 01:53:28,430
Okay, nice.

2264
01:53:28,670 --> 01:53:29,350
Get outta here.

2265
01:53:30,090 --> 01:53:30,810
That's right!

2266
01:53:31,010 --> 01:53:32,470
This is the final piece!

2267
01:53:33,910 --> 01:53:34,890
Nice, we did it!

2268
01:53:35,550 --> 01:53:36,650
Our base now!

2269
01:53:41,170 --> 01:53:42,590
Wait, was he a real person?

2270
01:53:42,870 --> 01:53:43,810
He was so easy.

2271
01:53:43,970 --> 01:53:44,650
There's no way.

2272
01:53:45,490 --> 01:53:47,010
He has to be a default man, right?

2273
01:53:51,950 --> 01:53:53,070
Oh, okay.

2274
01:53:53,770 --> 01:53:54,410
We did it.

2275
01:53:54,410 --> 01:53:57,030
Now is our time to shine!

2276
01:53:57,530 --> 01:53:58,030
Ready!

2277
01:53:59,190 --> 01:53:59,690
Charge!

2278
01:53:59,910 --> 01:54:00,310
Are we charging?

2279
01:54:00,810 --> 01:54:01,390
Oh, shit!

2280
01:54:02,830 --> 01:54:03,570
Wait, what?

2281
01:54:03,750 --> 01:54:04,950
The assault was successful?

2282
01:54:05,210 --> 01:54:06,050
What did I do?

2283
01:54:06,170 --> 01:54:07,050
Oh, fuck!

2284
01:54:10,250 --> 01:54:12,350
Wait, how is this successful?

2285
01:54:12,490 --> 01:54:15,350
I just got shot down from my fucking horse!

2286
01:54:19,210 --> 01:54:20,830
I was like, what do you mean successful?

2287
01:54:22,730 --> 01:54:24,750
I did something.

2288
01:54:26,690 --> 01:54:27,950
Alright, let's go.

2289
01:54:32,570 --> 01:54:33,470
Alright, it's time.

2290
01:54:35,190 --> 01:54:36,030
I'm ready!

2291
01:54:37,890 --> 01:54:40,590
I'm ready to start punch- why are you running?

2292
01:54:40,950 --> 01:54:41,710
Why are you running?

2293
01:54:41,890 --> 01:54:43,630
You're wasting my fucking meter!

2294
01:54:43,830 --> 01:54:45,390
Why the fuck are you running?

2295
01:54:47,350 --> 01:54:48,250
There we go.

2296
01:54:51,550 --> 01:54:52,670
What am I doing?

2297
01:54:53,090 --> 01:54:53,690
Oh, shit!

2298
01:54:54,530 --> 01:54:57,190
Oh my god, the fuck he made?

2299
01:54:58,910 --> 01:55:00,830
Defeat three enemy officers?

2300
01:55:00,990 --> 01:55:02,470
Wait, I just defeated one!

2301
01:55:02,910 --> 01:55:03,970
Wait, that's not fair!

2302
01:55:07,630 --> 01:55:08,710
What the fuck?

2303
01:55:10,190 --> 01:55:11,410
That's fucking right.

2304
01:55:11,650 --> 01:55:12,310
I'm ready.

2305
01:55:13,250 --> 01:55:14,930
I'm gonna start punching this.

2306
01:55:14,930 --> 01:55:16,630
Oh, fuck!

2307
01:55:17,850 --> 01:55:19,210
Oh, shit!

2308
01:55:19,670 --> 01:55:21,290
What the fuck happened?

2309
01:55:22,550 --> 01:55:24,690
Wait, I killed a general?

2310
01:55:27,470 --> 01:55:29,250
Oh my god.

2311
01:55:31,540 --> 01:55:34,410
I just killed- alright, get down from here.

2312
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:38,430
Get down from here.

2313
01:55:38,430 --> 01:55:43,510
Like, I just randomly killed a general.

2314
01:55:43,750 --> 01:55:50,430
I don't even know how that happened!

2315
01:55:50,970 --> 01:55:52,250
I was like, what happened?

2316
01:55:52,670 --> 01:55:53,710
Wait, he's dead?

2317
01:55:56,350 --> 01:55:57,930
That's right, swing.

2318
01:55:58,710 --> 01:55:59,950
Swing time.

2319
01:56:01,250 --> 01:56:03,350
Where do I find another general?

2320
01:56:03,350 --> 01:56:03,710
General!

2321
01:56:08,070 --> 01:56:10,070
Okay, he's like right there.

2322
01:56:10,490 --> 01:56:12,330
Give me a sec, I'm heading over!

2323
01:56:14,470 --> 01:56:17,190
This dork, he was just that guy, Dirky.

2324
01:56:19,410 --> 01:56:20,290
Okay, there we go.

2325
01:56:21,490 --> 01:56:23,390
They were so far away from me that I caught him.

2326
01:56:25,030 --> 01:56:25,650
Okay, nice.

2327
01:56:29,690 --> 01:56:30,590
Okay, nice.

2328
01:56:30,730 --> 01:56:31,270
Get out of here.

2329
01:56:31,490 --> 01:56:34,230
I need one more general to die.

2330
01:56:35,290 --> 01:56:36,310
Get out!

2331
01:56:38,470 --> 01:56:39,230
Oh, shit.

2332
01:56:39,930 --> 01:56:40,730
Oh, shit!

2333
01:56:42,210 --> 01:56:44,010
Please, I just need one more!

2334
01:56:44,190 --> 01:56:44,450
Please!

2335
01:56:47,870 --> 01:56:48,410
Press?

2336
01:56:50,170 --> 01:56:50,510
There.

2337
01:56:52,330 --> 01:56:54,270
Please, I just need one more!

2338
01:56:57,450 --> 01:56:58,990
Nice, I got it.

2339
01:56:59,170 --> 01:56:59,810
We did it.

2340
01:57:01,450 --> 01:57:03,190
That's right, no more shield for you.

2341
01:57:06,010 --> 01:57:08,670
Oh, wow, oh my god, Hong Dang, how?

2342
01:57:10,210 --> 01:57:11,570
How, Hong Dang?

2343
01:57:13,490 --> 01:57:15,390
We literally killed everybody!

2344
01:57:16,770 --> 01:57:18,350
Stop being so pathetic!

2345
01:57:19,550 --> 01:57:21,030
That's, alright, I'll go straight.

2346
01:57:21,150 --> 01:57:22,130
Oh my god, his shield.

2347
01:57:24,390 --> 01:57:25,370
Where are we?

2348
01:57:25,550 --> 01:57:27,310
Oh my god, I do not have it.

2349
01:57:27,530 --> 01:57:28,950
Oh, there's so many people.

2350
01:57:29,230 --> 01:57:29,990
Oh, please don't crash.

2351
01:57:30,270 --> 01:57:30,910
Please don't crash.

2352
01:57:31,050 --> 01:57:31,910
Please don't crash.

2353
01:57:32,050 --> 01:57:32,670
Every time.

2354
01:57:34,670 --> 01:57:36,010
Oh, please don't crash.

2355
01:57:36,190 --> 01:57:36,950
Please don't crash.

2356
01:57:37,150 --> 01:57:39,910
Every time I hit a thousand, I get scared!

2357
01:57:40,390 --> 01:57:41,850
Oh, I'm a true warrior!

2358
01:57:43,110 --> 01:57:45,370
Oh, thank god, I'm a true warrior!

2359
01:57:48,230 --> 01:57:49,970
Oh, Suda-chan, please live.

2360
01:57:53,250 --> 01:57:54,250
Okay, nice.

2361
01:57:54,570 --> 01:57:55,710
Please don't.

2362
01:57:56,250 --> 01:57:58,070
I just want to be a true warrior!

2363
01:58:02,830 --> 01:58:05,490
Okay, nice.

2364
01:58:07,650 --> 01:58:09,070
Wait, who challenged me?

2365
01:58:10,190 --> 01:58:10,850
Who is it?

2366
01:58:11,470 --> 01:58:12,530
Who wants to battle me?

2367
01:58:12,890 --> 01:58:13,790
I can't see!

2368
01:58:14,870 --> 01:58:17,990
There's too many people who wants to battle me!

2369
01:58:18,670 --> 01:58:20,390
I can't tell!

2370
01:58:20,810 --> 01:58:21,890
There's too many!

2371
01:58:24,770 --> 01:58:25,770
I can't see!

2372
01:58:30,210 --> 01:58:32,170
Oh my god, where's Sifu?

2373
01:58:36,570 --> 01:58:42,410
Wait, okay, let me kill this Yiji first, and then I'll go get Sifu, whoever he is.

2374
01:58:52,750 --> 01:58:54,190
Okay, I swear to god!

2375
01:58:55,290 --> 01:58:55,790
Oh shit!

2376
01:58:56,230 --> 01:58:57,890
Oh shit, wait, I might actually die!

2377
01:58:58,270 --> 01:58:58,650
Wait a minute.

2378
01:58:58,770 --> 01:58:59,510
Oh, JKF.

2379
01:58:59,830 --> 01:59:01,010
Killing him got me food.

2380
01:59:01,750 --> 01:59:04,030
Where the fuck is he over here?

2381
01:59:07,190 --> 01:59:08,270
I can't move!

2382
01:59:12,730 --> 01:59:13,970
Where is he?

2383
01:59:16,630 --> 01:59:17,750
Oh my god, there you are!

2384
01:59:17,750 --> 01:59:21,770
I was like, where are they?

2385
01:59:24,010 --> 01:59:25,190
Okay, I got him.

2386
01:59:25,630 --> 01:59:26,610
It's fine.

2387
01:59:28,130 --> 01:59:29,310
I found him.

2388
01:59:30,010 --> 01:59:31,210
Guys, I found him.

2389
01:59:31,730 --> 01:59:34,690
I couldn't... there was too many people!

2390
01:59:35,190 --> 01:59:36,770
Like, did you see that?

2391
01:59:39,170 --> 01:59:41,510
I was like, what was I supposed to do?

2392
01:59:44,870 --> 01:59:45,610
Okay, nice.

2393
01:59:45,990 --> 01:59:47,450
Oh please, I need to kill him then.

2394
01:59:48,050 --> 01:59:49,790
Oh no, please, I went forward!

2395
01:59:50,290 --> 01:59:51,130
Where is he?

2396
01:59:53,410 --> 01:59:54,550
Oh my god, that guy!

2397
01:59:55,030 --> 01:59:55,810
Twist 20!

2398
01:59:55,950 --> 01:59:56,430
I did it!

2399
01:59:59,070 --> 02:00:00,010
Okay, nice.

2400
02:00:00,550 --> 02:00:01,310
We did it.

2401
02:00:04,110 --> 02:00:05,450
Okay, we made it, guys.

2402
02:00:05,650 --> 02:00:06,830
We fucking made it!

2403
02:00:10,130 --> 02:00:11,490
Okay, I just need to get rid of these guys.

2404
02:00:11,510 --> 02:00:12,090
Get rid of these guys too.

2405
02:00:12,870 --> 02:00:14,790
There's so many people.

2406
02:00:15,410 --> 02:00:17,350
Oh my god!

2407
02:00:18,230 --> 02:00:20,610
Wait, what do you mean they're closing in?

2408
02:00:25,270 --> 02:00:26,610
Fuck, try my best!

2409
02:00:26,650 --> 02:00:27,610
There's so many!

2410
02:00:33,330 --> 02:00:34,090
Okay, nice.

2411
02:00:35,610 --> 02:00:37,230
Don't worry, I'll protect him.

2412
02:00:40,900 --> 02:00:42,060
Wait, time limit?

2413
02:00:42,320 --> 02:00:42,680
Time remaining?

2414
02:00:42,840 --> 02:00:44,040
Okay, 14 minutes, that's fine.

2415
02:00:44,520 --> 02:00:45,220
That's fine.

2416
02:00:45,360 --> 02:00:46,860
We can make it.

2417
02:00:47,800 --> 02:00:48,720
Oh shit.

2418
02:00:49,140 --> 02:00:50,280
We can make it, guys!

2419
02:00:53,740 --> 02:00:54,840
Okay, that's it.

2420
02:00:54,900 --> 02:00:56,240
I'm done.

2421
02:00:56,420 --> 02:00:57,900
I'm done using this.

2422
02:00:58,500 --> 02:01:00,400
I'm bringing the big boys.

2423
02:01:01,740 --> 02:01:03,860
I'm bringing the big boys!

2424
02:01:04,380 --> 02:01:06,480
I'm fucking done playing around!

2425
02:01:09,280 --> 02:01:10,340
Oh shit.

2426
02:01:10,880 --> 02:01:12,520
Oh shit, okay.

2427
02:01:12,720 --> 02:01:14,940
Okay, okay, okay, guys.

2428
02:01:15,140 --> 02:01:16,420
Guys, calm down.

2429
02:01:17,140 --> 02:01:18,500
Guys, calm down!

2430
02:01:21,700 --> 02:01:22,400
Nice.

2431
02:01:23,340 --> 02:01:24,760
Okay, now he's dead.

2432
02:01:28,220 --> 02:01:29,180
Get out!

2433
02:01:32,520 --> 02:01:33,840
Get out of here!

2434
02:01:33,940 --> 02:01:34,680
Oh fuck!

2435
02:01:37,180 --> 02:01:38,560
Get out of here!

2436
02:01:44,220 --> 02:01:45,140
Jesus Christ.

2437
02:01:47,880 --> 02:01:48,820
Do your thing!

2438
02:01:49,260 --> 02:01:51,500
Do your thing while I fight him in the background!

2439
02:01:51,940 --> 02:01:54,880
Wait, I'm still fighting him while this whole thing is going on.

2440
02:01:55,160 --> 02:01:57,640
I don't even see it!

2441
02:02:01,540 --> 02:02:02,000
Okay.

2442
02:02:03,540 --> 02:02:05,920
Oh my god, there's so many people that's in front of me.

2443
02:02:05,920 --> 02:02:08,660
I can't tell what's going on anymore.

2444
02:02:08,840 --> 02:02:10,800
There's too many people fighting.

2445
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:16,100
Oh thank god, I got buns.

2446
02:02:17,100 --> 02:02:17,780
Oh shit!

2447
02:02:18,880 --> 02:02:19,940
Extreme Musou!

2448
02:02:25,710 --> 02:02:26,470
Nice.

2449
02:02:28,950 --> 02:02:30,210
Get over here.

2450
02:02:30,930 --> 02:02:32,670
Get over here, Lu Biao!

2451
02:02:33,170 --> 02:02:34,750
Get over here!

2452
02:02:34,750 --> 02:02:34,870
Get over here!

2453
02:02:37,310 --> 02:02:38,590
Oh shit, did I do it?

2454
02:02:39,050 --> 02:02:39,810
Oh nice, I did.

2455
02:02:39,890 --> 02:02:40,490
Okay, thank god.

2456
02:02:40,530 --> 02:02:42,410
I thought he was going to fucking kill me.

2457
02:02:45,530 --> 02:02:46,430
That's fucking right.

2458
02:02:47,150 --> 02:02:48,910
The big boys are here.

2459
02:02:51,210 --> 02:02:51,930
That's right.

2460
02:02:52,410 --> 02:02:55,010
I actually know how to use this weapon!

2461
02:02:56,210 --> 02:02:56,970
Oh fuck!

2462
02:02:57,230 --> 02:02:57,650
Oh fuck!

2463
02:02:57,850 --> 02:02:58,390
Oh fuck!

2464
02:02:58,590 --> 02:02:59,570
Oh, did I dodge it?

2465
02:02:59,670 --> 02:03:00,650
Oh, that was so close!

2466
02:03:01,550 --> 02:03:04,650
Oh my god, I dodged it again!

2467
02:03:06,150 --> 02:03:07,750
Okay, that scared me.

2468
02:03:07,870 --> 02:03:09,710
She died for this.

2469
02:03:10,050 --> 02:03:12,110
She died for all her sins.

2470
02:03:12,810 --> 02:03:13,570
We did it!

2471
02:03:16,250 --> 02:03:18,170
Guys, look at that, I actually dodged.

2472
02:03:22,430 --> 02:03:23,690
Perfect dodge.

2473
02:03:24,970 --> 02:03:25,530
Fun!

2474
02:03:29,670 --> 02:03:31,910
We did it, and he lives!

2475
02:03:34,370 --> 02:03:36,370
Alright, Twin Peaks.

2476
02:03:36,550 --> 02:03:37,730
Okay, we don't care about that.

2477
02:03:39,050 --> 02:03:41,290
Most historically accurate battle.

2478
02:03:43,590 --> 02:03:44,330
Oh nice!

2479
02:03:45,290 --> 02:03:47,330
Picked up a lot of weapons that I'm not going to use.

2480
02:03:48,110 --> 02:03:49,590
We got Lu Bu's thing.

2481
02:03:50,310 --> 02:03:51,770
We got another Lu Bu thing.

2482
02:03:53,050 --> 02:03:55,530
We got the Twin Peaks there.

2483
02:03:56,650 --> 02:03:57,170
Wow!

2484
02:03:57,670 --> 02:03:58,970
It lacks so much.

2485
02:04:00,270 --> 02:04:03,250
Alright, and that did a perfect thing.

2486
02:04:03,390 --> 02:04:05,110
Is there another Twin Peaks thing I have to do?

2487
02:04:06,050 --> 02:04:09,910
Let's see, defeat 50 enemies using pull it out.

2488
02:04:10,590 --> 02:04:11,790
I don't know this one.

2489
02:04:12,530 --> 02:04:14,030
I don't know how to do this one.

2490
02:04:14,110 --> 02:04:15,350
I'm just going to pay to win that.

2491
02:04:17,390 --> 02:04:20,670
I can't be bothered to figure this one out.

2492
02:04:22,250 --> 02:04:23,870
Oh, get defense here.

2493
02:04:23,970 --> 02:04:25,010
I mean, we can get all of them.

2494
02:04:26,510 --> 02:04:28,150
He's going to be so proud of me, guys.

2495
02:04:29,850 --> 02:04:32,190
Oh my god, he's going to be so proud of me.

2496
02:04:33,790 --> 02:04:34,950
It's a timing base?

2497
02:04:35,010 --> 02:04:36,530
Yeah, we're not going to get that right.

2498
02:04:37,630 --> 02:04:39,050
I just learned how to dodge.

2499
02:04:39,170 --> 02:04:41,070
I don't think I can learn the second thing.

2500
02:04:58,400 --> 02:05:00,300
Yeah, don't worry your boyfriend.

2501
02:05:04,840 --> 02:05:06,060
Sorry, your roommate.

2502
02:05:06,400 --> 02:05:08,020
Sorry, your roommate, guys.

2503
02:05:15,520 --> 02:05:16,580
That was me.

2504
02:05:16,840 --> 02:05:17,600
I did that.

2505
02:05:17,600 --> 02:05:18,500
Yeah.

2506
02:05:23,260 --> 02:05:24,840
Whoa, wait, wait.

2507
02:05:30,360 --> 02:05:32,000
Yeah, childhood friend, guys.

2508
02:05:43,400 --> 02:05:44,240
Oh, likewise.

2509
02:05:49,060 --> 02:05:51,200
This was not a rare pair, guys.

2510
02:05:51,820 --> 02:05:53,940
Fuck them for not being a rare pair.

2511
02:06:25,500 --> 02:06:26,700
Yeah, dad.

2512
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:28,500
Where are you hiding from him?

2513
02:06:46,290 --> 02:06:48,410
Why is Student Quad not here yet?

2514
02:06:48,410 --> 02:06:51,050
Student Quad, like, inherits the throne.

2515
02:06:52,290 --> 02:06:53,890
Where the fuck is Student Quad?

2516
02:06:58,470 --> 02:06:58,990
Like...

2517
02:06:58,990 --> 02:07:02,050
He's like, all my sons are... all my children are here.

2518
02:07:02,210 --> 02:07:03,270
Oh, there he is!

2519
02:07:03,930 --> 02:07:05,710
Why the fuck was he not talking?

2520
02:07:08,370 --> 02:07:09,490
What the fuck?

2521
02:07:09,550 --> 02:07:10,850
Where did he come from?

2522
02:07:13,170 --> 02:07:14,490
He's right there.

2523
02:07:14,710 --> 02:07:16,710
Oh my god, he's so young!

2524
02:07:20,670 --> 02:07:22,610
Holy shit, who is he?

2525
02:07:23,310 --> 02:07:24,610
Why does he look like that?

2526
02:07:25,070 --> 02:07:26,310
He's so young!

2527
02:07:34,550 --> 02:07:35,590
He's eight.

2528
02:07:35,690 --> 02:07:36,470
Oh, guys.

2529
02:07:37,510 --> 02:07:44,630
If we can send Sun Quan Xian as a child soldier, we can send Sun Quan in.

2530
02:07:45,210 --> 02:07:47,410
She's only two years younger than her.

2531
02:07:51,130 --> 02:07:52,850
The Imperial Seal.

2532
02:07:53,790 --> 02:07:57,030
Then Liu Biao's attempt to prevent our return was...

2533
02:07:57,030 --> 02:07:57,970
Precisely.

2534
02:07:58,510 --> 02:08:01,470
My first thought was that they were coming after the seal.

2535
02:08:02,150 --> 02:08:06,350
But I have no intention of ever handing it over to the likes of them.

2536
02:08:07,270 --> 02:08:13,830
As a loyal subject of the Han, I will fulfill my duty to guard it with my life.

2537
02:08:14,350 --> 02:08:18,050
And when the time comes, I'll return it to His Majesty.

2538
02:08:18,050 --> 02:08:25,310
After discussing it with Cheng Pu, we have decided that this is the best path to take.

2539
02:08:25,990 --> 02:08:34,070
But, this also means that all of you will be dragged into the inevitable conflict that will arise.

2540
02:08:34,970 --> 02:08:37,950
As part of the family, just sail into the ocean.

2541
02:08:38,450 --> 02:08:39,950
Nobody can hurt you there.

2542
02:08:41,050 --> 02:08:45,830
If this is the path you've chosen for us, then we will be with you to the very end of it.

2543
02:08:46,230 --> 02:08:46,650
Won't we?

2544
02:08:46,650 --> 02:08:50,650
It's not like anything bad is going to happen to the family, guys.

2545
02:08:55,950 --> 02:08:59,010
The Red Mafia invites you to their family.

2546
02:09:00,410 --> 02:09:05,430
The most dangerous threat is the formal leader of the Alliance, Yuan Shao.

2547
02:09:06,370 --> 02:09:10,110
He believes that the Imperial seal belongs in his hands.

2548
02:09:10,950 --> 02:09:15,310
There are many other forces interested in claiming the seal for themselves.

2549
02:09:15,630 --> 02:09:19,130
It's like the family and also Sun Ce's boyfriend.

2550
02:09:19,810 --> 02:09:21,870
Sorry, Sun Ce's roommate.

2551
02:09:24,350 --> 02:09:26,970
I like how Joey is just there.

2552
02:09:27,070 --> 02:09:28,070
He's like, hey guys.

2553
02:09:29,010 --> 02:09:31,870
This is a family meeting and I'm family now.

2554
02:09:32,170 --> 02:09:33,830
Okay, I need to use the bathroom.

2555
02:09:34,230 --> 02:09:35,610
I'll be right back.

2556
02:09:43,020 --> 02:09:44,300
Still getting more water.

2557
02:11:15,310 --> 02:11:16,270
I'm back.

2558
02:11:16,430 --> 02:11:17,710
I'm back, everybody.

2559
02:11:18,050 --> 02:11:18,710
I'm back.

2560
02:11:19,430 --> 02:11:24,250
Allen, Medi, Byte, Poro, Krish, thank you for the super chat.

2561
02:11:24,370 --> 02:11:25,390
Thank you, thank you.

2562
02:11:25,530 --> 02:11:25,790
Alright.

2563
02:11:26,330 --> 02:11:27,330
You think he's up to something?

2564
02:11:27,330 --> 02:11:32,210
This is most likely a trap meant to trick us into destroying each other.

2565
02:11:33,070 --> 02:11:36,550
And then he'll pick at our remains like some kind of vulture.

2566
02:11:37,610 --> 02:11:40,130
Yuan Shao is a treacherous fool.

2567
02:11:41,310 --> 02:11:42,210
He is indeed.

2568
02:11:43,430 --> 02:11:47,210
But I plan to jump right into this trap of his all the same.

2569
02:11:47,790 --> 02:11:54,850
To protect the Imperial seal from the chaos of our world, we must be prepared to ally with beasts.

2570
02:11:54,850 --> 02:11:56,690
See, Zhou, you should be standing there.

2571
02:11:56,890 --> 02:11:59,270
Like where all the non-family members are.

2572
02:11:59,690 --> 02:12:01,730
Why the fuck is he in the family meeting?

2573
02:12:11,510 --> 02:12:12,030
Guys,

2574
02:12:16,970 --> 02:12:17,530
you don't understand.

2575
02:12:17,730 --> 02:12:23,490
As his roommate, he gets special privilege because he is family now.

2576
02:12:26,750 --> 02:12:27,970
Hey, Sun Tzu.

2577
02:12:40,440 --> 02:12:47,480
Like, he's the only one that looks the same out of all the Dynasty Warriors games.

2578
02:12:47,780 --> 02:12:49,320
He's like the only one that looks the same.

2579
02:12:49,980 --> 02:12:51,580
Everybody else looks so different.

2580
02:12:53,520 --> 02:12:55,400
Like, they never changed his design.

2581
02:12:55,720 --> 02:12:57,100
Like, they were like, this is perfect.

2582
02:12:57,340 --> 02:12:58,060
No, don't change it.

2583
02:12:58,920 --> 02:13:00,520
This is perfect.

2584
02:13:00,680 --> 02:13:02,340
We've hit perfection for him.

2585
02:13:04,920 --> 02:13:05,920
I will.

2586
02:13:06,140 --> 02:13:06,920
I'm counting on you.

2587
02:13:07,740 --> 02:13:11,580
The fight to protect the Imperial seal from our rivals is far from over.

2588
02:13:12,220 --> 02:13:16,720
Now that I think about it, my father was very brave to keep such a thing.

2589
02:13:17,600 --> 02:13:20,680
But I suppose that's just the kind of man he is.

2590
02:13:21,500 --> 02:13:27,080
After all, they don't call him the Tiger simply because of his prowess in battle.

2591
02:13:27,680 --> 02:13:32,320
Once he sets his mind on something, he dashes forth with courage and vigor.

2592
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:36,420
The lesser beasts in his way can't help but clear a path for him.

2593
02:13:38,440 --> 02:13:41,060
Indeed, he is an unstoppable force.

2594
02:13:42,020 --> 02:13:43,280
He really is.

2595
02:13:44,140 --> 02:13:46,520
I think that disregard for danger...

2596
02:13:46,520 --> 02:13:49,100
Oh yeah, it's not like someone's gonna die young too.

2597
02:13:49,640 --> 02:13:51,800
Wherever my feet take me comes from my father.

2598
02:13:52,520 --> 02:13:55,480
I also tend to trip and fall quite a bit along the way.

2599
02:13:55,480 --> 02:13:56,140
Woah!

2600
02:13:56,320 --> 02:13:56,680
Woah!

2601
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:57,380
Woah!

2602
02:13:57,500 --> 02:14:00,520
If you're gonna keep foreshadowing, it might become real!

2603
02:14:03,420 --> 02:14:03,980
Woah!

2604
02:14:04,840 --> 02:14:07,820
Unlike me, he's always thinking things through.

2605
02:14:08,680 --> 02:14:10,860
You should get to know him if you get the chance.

2606
02:14:13,860 --> 02:14:17,440
Of course I... Well, if you insist, I'll get to know him.

2607
02:14:18,320 --> 02:14:19,640
Alright, it's settled.

2608
02:14:22,780 --> 02:14:24,960
Johnny, thank you for the one gifted ship!

2609
02:14:25,120 --> 02:14:26,240
Thank you, thank you!

2610
02:14:42,440 --> 02:14:43,200
Alright, nice!

2611
02:14:43,760 --> 02:14:45,320
It's time to get to know Zhou Yu.

2612
02:14:45,500 --> 02:14:47,260
Wait, we're talking to his other brother?

2613
02:14:54,360 --> 02:14:56,300
Wait, it's pronounced Sun Quan?

2614
02:14:57,080 --> 02:14:59,180
I thought it was Sun Quan!

2615
02:15:00,780 --> 02:15:03,420
Oh no, the English dub has fucked me up, guys.

2616
02:15:08,080 --> 02:15:11,280
Oh my god, the English dub for these games has fucked up.

2617
02:15:11,760 --> 02:15:14,000
Oh, they're pronouncing it wrong.

2618
02:15:14,140 --> 02:15:14,400
Okay.

2619
02:15:14,400 --> 02:15:16,220
Okay, guys, it's not my fault, is it?

2620
02:15:21,500 --> 02:15:24,240
Wait, is Quan or Chan the correct way?

2621
02:15:24,500 --> 02:15:26,020
Did he fuck up his own name?

2622
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:28,660
It's Sun Quan?

2623
02:15:28,920 --> 02:15:30,240
I fucking knew it!

2624
02:15:32,840 --> 02:15:34,200
No, wait, I'm wrong?

2625
02:15:34,320 --> 02:15:35,240
I don't know anymore.

2626
02:15:35,380 --> 02:15:37,960
I don't know if I'm wrong or he's wrong.

2627
02:15:39,220 --> 02:15:40,680
Let's fight together, then.

2628
02:15:58,480 --> 02:15:59,040
Okay.

2629
02:16:01,660 --> 02:16:03,340
I'll say you will grow stronger.

2630
02:16:04,200 --> 02:16:07,660
You will be the oldest Sun person in the entire family.

2631
02:16:10,700 --> 02:16:13,860
Oh, his pronunciation is the right one?

2632
02:16:14,100 --> 02:16:14,960
Oh my god.

2633
02:16:17,100 --> 02:16:18,500
Can't believe it.

2634
02:16:18,980 --> 02:16:20,860
He'll always be Sun Quan for me.

2635
02:16:24,800 --> 02:16:28,240
Can't believe they made him hot!

2636
02:16:35,680 --> 02:16:39,380
No, I don't recognize his voice actor.

2637
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:43,960
He'll be their equal one day.

2638
02:16:44,520 --> 02:16:45,200
You're too modest.

2639
02:16:45,440 --> 02:16:46,760
Yeah, I just met you.

2640
02:16:47,340 --> 02:16:50,200
Like, look at his eyes!

2641
02:16:54,920 --> 02:16:56,800
Why do you have green eyes?

2642
02:16:58,520 --> 02:17:02,000
Sorry, I have just gone on and on about myself.

2643
02:17:03,220 --> 02:17:05,740
Regardless, today has been fruitful.

2644
02:17:06,800 --> 02:17:10,480
If it isn't too much trouble, I want to speak with you like this again.

2645
02:17:11,380 --> 02:17:14,860
Being with you keeps me from straying from my true path.

2646
02:17:14,860 --> 02:17:15,980
Can't stop looking at his eyes.

2647
02:17:16,060 --> 02:17:16,920
It's so weird.

2648
02:17:17,160 --> 02:17:17,880
I can feel it.

2649
02:17:18,040 --> 02:17:18,940
It's so uncanny.

2650
02:17:22,900 --> 02:17:25,300
Staring into bro's eyes.

2651
02:17:25,400 --> 02:17:28,520
Alright, so there's a reason why I never liked Sun Quan.

2652
02:17:28,900 --> 02:17:32,020
And like, it's sort of his voice acting and the way he looked.

2653
02:17:32,220 --> 02:17:35,240
So this is what he used to sound like in the past.

2654
02:17:35,820 --> 02:17:36,580
Sun Quan.

2655
02:17:37,940 --> 02:17:38,420
Dynasty.

2656
02:17:40,100 --> 02:17:40,580
Warriors.

2657
02:17:41,460 --> 02:17:45,940
This is how he used to sound like and I never liked his voice acting because of it.

2658
02:17:46,800 --> 02:17:47,600
Was it this one?

2659
02:17:48,520 --> 02:17:49,860
Wait, is it this one?

2660
02:17:49,960 --> 02:17:52,120
He sounded so like, shrill.

2661
02:17:52,300 --> 02:17:53,740
And I was just like, oh.

2662
02:17:54,600 --> 02:17:55,180
Let me check.

2663
02:17:59,830 --> 02:18:00,790
What was it?

2664
02:18:01,950 --> 02:18:04,690
I'm trying to find... When he screams, it was like...

2665
02:18:07,090 --> 02:18:11,890
When he starts yelling, it...

2666
02:18:11,890 --> 02:18:13,350
No, where was it?

2667
02:18:13,450 --> 02:18:16,270
You know how he sounded super hoarse, too?

2668
02:18:17,030 --> 02:18:18,290
What game was it?

2669
02:18:18,290 --> 02:18:21,970
What game was it where his voice was super hoarse and everything?

2670
02:18:22,610 --> 02:18:26,310
It was like... I can't remember exactly which version it was.

2671
02:18:26,450 --> 02:18:31,170
And he... Yeah, he sounded like... No, he actually sounded like a crow.

2672
02:18:34,430 --> 02:18:38,470
When he starts yelling, it was like...

2673
02:18:38,470 --> 02:18:39,230
It was a 3?

2674
02:18:39,450 --> 02:18:40,330
Oh my god.

2675
02:18:40,650 --> 02:18:44,550
Is it because of 3 and 4 that made me not like Sun Quan?

2676
02:18:44,870 --> 02:18:46,130
I think it could be.

2677
02:18:46,130 --> 02:18:48,910
I can't believe it.

2678
02:18:49,050 --> 02:18:50,670
That was

2679
02:18:54,920 --> 02:18:58,060
how long ago it was, and it made me not like it.

2680
02:19:00,640 --> 02:19:02,360
Oh my god, where was it?

2681
02:19:06,780 --> 02:19:10,040
Oh my god, I can't find the one where he's yelling.

2682
02:19:10,520 --> 02:19:13,360
I'm trying to find the yelling voice line.

2683
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,300
When he starts yelling, I hated it.

2684
02:19:17,640 --> 02:19:21,520
The first impression... Also, I never liked his character design, too.

2685
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:25,240
His character design was not it for him.

2686
02:19:27,200 --> 02:19:28,880
Alright, I can't find it, guys.

2687
02:19:29,240 --> 02:19:30,060
He sounds normal.

2688
02:19:30,180 --> 02:19:31,660
The ones I found, he sounds normal.

2689
02:19:31,780 --> 02:19:33,360
But there is a moment... I swear to god.

2690
02:19:33,640 --> 02:19:38,960
There is a moment in Dynasty Warriors when he starts yelling, and I was like...

2691
02:19:38,960 --> 02:19:39,700
That ain't it.

2692
02:19:41,160 --> 02:19:42,060
That ain't it.

2693
02:19:42,200 --> 02:19:44,820
He was so goofy to me.

2694
02:19:45,220 --> 02:19:47,560
And then I was just like... Oh, and also the beard.

2695
02:19:47,680 --> 02:19:49,600
Yeah, the beard did not help him at all.

2696
02:19:49,600 --> 02:19:50,660
No, 100%.

2697
02:19:50,660 --> 02:19:51,260
I agree.

2698
02:19:51,840 --> 02:19:53,340
His beard was not it.

2699
02:19:56,100 --> 02:19:56,520
Oh, hey.

2700
02:19:56,760 --> 02:19:57,620
It's our student's day.

2701
02:20:01,280 --> 02:20:02,360
It's something my father taught me.

2702
02:20:02,380 --> 02:20:03,700
I'd like to pass it on to you.

2703
02:20:03,860 --> 02:20:04,200
Okay.

2704
02:20:04,780 --> 02:20:05,620
The gauntlets.

2705
02:20:09,640 --> 02:20:12,240
Do I have enough money yet?

2706
02:20:12,580 --> 02:20:14,780
No, I'm still poor.

2707
02:20:15,720 --> 02:20:16,240
No.

2708
02:20:17,400 --> 02:20:20,200
I'm still so poor.

2709
02:20:20,200 --> 02:20:24,080
Why did you take all my money?

2710
02:20:25,340 --> 02:20:31,640
Why did you take all my money?

2711
02:20:32,300 --> 02:20:35,480
I can't afford anything.

2712
02:20:37,720 --> 02:20:40,500
Guys, I swear to god.

2713
02:20:40,940 --> 02:20:42,560
It wasn't my fault.

2714
02:20:42,920 --> 02:20:45,340
He took my money, guys.

2715
02:20:45,340 --> 02:20:47,780
Officials are coming to inspect the city.

2716
02:20:48,900 --> 02:20:50,320
Oh, it's still just that.

2717
02:20:51,080 --> 02:20:56,420
No, I swear to god it wasn't me.

2718
02:20:56,540 --> 02:20:58,340
He took it all, guys.

2719
02:20:58,700 --> 02:21:00,420
He did that.

2720
02:21:00,580 --> 02:21:01,520
Not me.

2721
02:21:02,700 --> 02:21:04,340
He did that.

2722
02:21:04,920 --> 02:21:06,480
Is this Chao Chao's one?

2723
02:21:06,580 --> 02:21:07,140
Yeah, it is.

2724
02:21:07,220 --> 02:21:08,360
Suppression of Yang's province.

2725
02:21:08,580 --> 02:21:09,600
Alright, let's do this one.

2726
02:21:09,980 --> 02:21:10,940
And then we'll call it here.

2727
02:21:14,240 --> 02:21:15,840
I don't want to stream too long today.

2728
02:21:16,900 --> 02:21:20,220
My voice needs rest.

2729
02:21:23,950 --> 02:21:26,330
We'll do this and then we'll do the routes.

2730
02:21:26,850 --> 02:21:30,270
We'll go back to the routes and see who I need to talk to.

2731
02:21:31,970 --> 02:21:33,510
They have no clear leader.

2732
02:21:34,330 --> 02:21:35,350
Does it lack a commander?

2733
02:21:35,590 --> 02:21:36,330
Happy Lu Bu.

2734
02:21:36,510 --> 02:21:37,550
Happy life.

2735
02:21:37,890 --> 02:21:39,330
Zero, thank you for the super chat.

2736
02:21:39,430 --> 02:21:40,510
Thank you, thank you.

2737
02:21:40,870 --> 02:21:43,630
We need to take them out one by one until their morale is diminished.

2738
02:21:43,810 --> 02:21:45,030
Unlike them, we have a leader.

2739
02:21:45,370 --> 02:21:47,390
Our forces will lead by Lord Chao Chao himself.

2740
02:21:47,390 --> 02:21:47,910
You know, wait.

2741
02:21:47,990 --> 02:21:49,530
Actually, let's...

2742
02:21:49,530 --> 02:21:51,150
Let's... Okay, I'm skipping this.

2743
02:21:51,410 --> 02:21:52,130
Let's do the routes.

2744
02:21:53,170 --> 02:21:54,690
Okay, how do I...

2745
02:21:54,690 --> 02:21:56,150
I don't want to do this...

2746
02:21:56,150 --> 02:21:56,770
Cancel.

2747
02:21:56,990 --> 02:21:57,290
Yeah.

2748
02:21:57,770 --> 02:21:58,170
Cancel.

2749
02:21:59,110 --> 02:22:00,550
Sorry, I can't fight yet.

2750
02:22:00,930 --> 02:22:02,330
I want to do the routes first.

2751
02:22:04,490 --> 02:22:06,050
Sorry, let me leave the council.

2752
02:22:06,210 --> 02:22:07,510
I'm sorry, you talked a lot.

2753
02:22:07,910 --> 02:22:09,270
But like, I'll be back.

2754
02:22:09,290 --> 02:22:10,070
I swear to God.

2755
02:22:16,120 --> 02:22:16,720
What?

2756
02:22:25,300 --> 02:22:27,020
Oh, I have some old coins.

2757
02:22:27,240 --> 02:22:27,520
Nice.

2758
02:22:27,900 --> 02:22:28,860
I got some rocks.

2759
02:22:31,080 --> 02:22:31,480
Okay.

2760
02:22:33,420 --> 02:22:34,020
Interactions.

2761
02:22:34,320 --> 02:22:35,780
Who do I need to talk to?

2762
02:22:37,400 --> 02:22:38,640
Uh... Chang'an?

2763
02:22:38,980 --> 02:22:40,000
In the Sili Province.

2764
02:22:40,260 --> 02:22:42,120
Okay, I just need to talk to Chang'an.

2765
02:22:44,820 --> 02:22:46,180
Sorry, lock...

2766
02:22:46,180 --> 02:22:47,440
Okay, Sili Province.

2767
02:22:48,280 --> 02:22:49,000
Where's Sili?

2768
02:22:50,700 --> 02:22:51,260
Okay.

2769
02:22:51,700 --> 02:22:53,600
We gotta go find Chang'an.

2770
02:22:54,720 --> 02:22:55,980
Oh, there he is!

2771
02:22:57,800 --> 02:22:58,840
So Sili.

2772
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,920
Whoa, slow down there, Chang'an.

2773
02:23:20,960 --> 02:23:21,600
I like, okay.

2774
02:23:21,880 --> 02:23:24,780
I think the funniest is because like, Chinese pronunciation.

2775
02:23:25,200 --> 02:23:27,620
We have a set pronunciation of things like the toning.

2776
02:23:27,800 --> 02:23:29,140
But in English, we don't.

2777
02:23:29,380 --> 02:23:35,480
So it's always funny when like, you can tell that the voice actors are trying to accurately pronounce their own names.

2778
02:23:35,720 --> 02:23:41,300
But it always sounds so off when they're trying to mix it with the English pronunciation.

2779
02:23:42,720 --> 02:23:47,020
Like, if you talk in full Chinese, it makes sense.

2780
02:23:47,080 --> 02:23:52,220
But then, because English has its own way of speaking intonations, it just doesn't match well.

2781
02:23:53,840 --> 02:24:02,680
It's like when Toby Fox was like, talking about like, talking about Undertale in Japanese.

2782
02:24:03,320 --> 02:24:09,960
And then, he just starts, and then when he spoke in English word, it's so different.

2783
02:24:10,920 --> 02:24:12,720
He has the hard shipments.

2784
02:24:12,840 --> 02:24:14,620
Wait, what was it?

2785
02:24:14,780 --> 02:24:18,240
I forgot what he was trying to talk about, but it was so funny.

2786
02:24:18,580 --> 02:24:19,560
The Toho project.

2787
02:24:19,620 --> 02:24:20,040
Oh, yeah!

2788
02:24:20,400 --> 02:24:24,940
Wait, let me find the Toby Fox Toho project.

2789
02:24:25,140 --> 02:24:26,660
It just reminds me of that.

2790
02:24:29,480 --> 02:24:30,380
Okay, here we go.

2791
02:24:30,460 --> 02:24:33,380
This is Toby Fox, the guy who created Undertale.

2792
02:24:53,580 --> 02:24:55,480
I love that!

2793
02:25:00,460 --> 02:25:02,160
It's one of my favorites.

2794
02:25:02,440 --> 02:25:03,700
I love that.

2795
02:25:03,840 --> 02:25:04,640
It's so funny.

2796
02:25:05,380 --> 02:25:08,860
And, of course, ZUN's Toho project.

2797
02:25:14,700 --> 02:25:16,060
Toho project.

2798
02:25:19,620 --> 02:25:21,620
Oh, yeah, it's so...

2799
02:25:21,620 --> 02:25:24,640
It just really reminds me of when...

2800
02:25:28,400 --> 02:25:31,460
Our face must be truly like you and the great Gengun.

2801
02:25:31,620 --> 02:25:32,300
You think so?

2802
02:25:32,360 --> 02:25:32,860
No!

2803
02:25:34,460 --> 02:25:36,160
I know so.

2804
02:25:37,160 --> 02:25:41,260
I've been vying for a thorough discussion with you for some time now.

2805
02:25:41,260 --> 02:25:43,300
It reminds me of playing Deltarune when the game's finished.

2806
02:25:43,900 --> 02:25:48,480
I don't like it when it's like an ongoing thing and it's like the parts are ongoing.

2807
02:25:49,300 --> 02:25:50,640
Oh, he's taking an interest on me.

2808
02:25:50,680 --> 02:25:53,700
Because I have to stop and I have to remember what happened last time.

2809
02:25:53,800 --> 02:25:56,340
But the game's releases are so long?

2810
02:25:56,900 --> 02:25:58,780
The time between releases are so long.

2811
02:25:59,860 --> 02:26:02,840
Devoted to restoring peace in the realm.

2812
02:26:03,340 --> 02:26:05,680
A survivor of the fallen.

2813
02:26:09,930 --> 02:26:11,430
How much do you know?

2814
02:26:11,650 --> 02:26:13,110
Wait, I have no memory of it.

2815
02:26:13,230 --> 02:26:16,470
Yeah, that's the thing.

2816
02:26:16,930 --> 02:26:20,170
There's such a long gap in between Deltarune releases.

2817
02:26:20,430 --> 02:26:24,170
The reason why I don't play Undertale is because I watched every playthrough of Undertale.

2818
02:26:24,250 --> 02:26:28,410
We did the Sans fight though on stream because that's the most well-known thing.

2819
02:26:28,410 --> 02:26:32,470
But the reason why I've never done an Undertale is that I'm not going in blind.

2820
02:26:32,730 --> 02:26:34,250
I was a huge fan of Undertale.

2821
02:26:34,610 --> 02:26:38,050
I watched every playthrough and I know everything about Undertale.

2822
02:26:38,370 --> 02:26:42,110
So that's why I personally don't think I can play Undertale on stream.

2823
02:26:42,170 --> 02:26:44,330
Just because I already know what's going to happen and everything.

2824
02:26:44,730 --> 02:26:47,230
I know about all the routes and stuff like that.

2825
02:26:48,390 --> 02:26:50,230
I'm blind with Deltarune though.

2826
02:26:50,310 --> 02:26:54,990
I've never watched really any playthrough or know much about Deltarune.

2827
02:26:54,990 --> 02:27:02,950
So I don't mind playing Deltarune only because I don't really know any spoilers about it.

2828
02:27:03,310 --> 02:27:06,430
And also the fact that it is still ongoing and everything.

2829
02:27:06,550 --> 02:27:08,250
And I've never played it before.

2830
02:27:11,750 --> 02:27:17,670
Yeah, I'm not going in blind for Undertale.

2831
02:27:19,770 --> 02:27:21,830
How much do you know?

2832
02:27:22,450 --> 02:27:23,630
Yeah, how much do you know?

2833
02:27:24,990 --> 02:27:25,210
Indeed.

2834
02:27:28,620 --> 02:27:31,720
That's about the extent of what I've learned about you.

2835
02:27:33,400 --> 02:27:34,600
Pursuing stability.

2836
02:27:35,340 --> 02:27:37,660
Relying on the abilities of others.

2837
02:27:38,260 --> 02:27:41,640
Living a carefree, unobserved life.

2838
02:27:42,240 --> 02:27:43,820
Slowly growing older.

2839
02:27:43,840 --> 02:27:46,060
Not going to lie, I'm not expecting you to be a big Undertale fan.

2840
02:27:46,140 --> 02:27:47,580
I was mostly a Sans fan.

2841
02:27:48,620 --> 02:27:50,420
That's really all I cared about.

2842
02:27:51,440 --> 02:27:53,420
And you just persist until you're no more.

2843
02:27:54,200 --> 02:27:57,260
Your way of life is totally different though.

2844
02:27:57,840 --> 02:27:59,960
And that fascinates me.

2845
02:28:00,320 --> 02:28:01,980
Woah, I'm fascinating too.

2846
02:28:02,980 --> 02:28:04,940
Sorry, I'm not going to swipe right.

2847
02:28:05,340 --> 02:28:05,780
That's what it is.

2848
02:28:05,800 --> 02:28:06,720
Yeah, I'm...

2849
02:28:09,160 --> 02:28:11,420
I have so many options.

2850
02:28:11,700 --> 02:28:12,340
Ding dong.

2851
02:28:12,580 --> 02:28:15,900
But I don't want to live reliant on the abilities of others.

2852
02:28:16,760 --> 02:28:21,680
I believe we are not too dissimilar.

2853
02:28:21,680 --> 02:28:23,380
You and I.

2854
02:28:25,900 --> 02:28:26,900
Perhaps that is so.

2855
02:28:27,840 --> 02:28:31,500
Oh, I did not expect you to hold back out of politeness.

2856
02:28:31,880 --> 02:28:32,460
Woah!

2857
02:28:33,240 --> 02:28:34,040
Yeah, that's right.

2858
02:28:34,040 --> 02:28:35,040
I'm very forward.

2859
02:28:36,700 --> 02:28:41,960
On the one hand, there are those who yearn for such a lifestyle.

2860
02:28:42,640 --> 02:28:48,100
On the other, there are those who naturally throw themselves into it.

2861
02:28:48,100 --> 02:28:52,960
They seem similar, but are fundamentally different.

2862
02:28:53,860 --> 02:28:59,700
It is precisely for that reason that I believe we can form deep bonds together.

2863
02:29:00,400 --> 02:29:03,940
I look forward to deepening this relationship.

2864
02:29:04,340 --> 02:29:06,560
I feel the same.

2865
02:29:06,560 --> 02:29:07,340
Mr. Gong?

2866
02:29:08,320 --> 02:29:09,260
Friendship, right?

2867
02:29:09,740 --> 02:29:10,040
Oh, sorry.

2868
02:29:10,120 --> 02:29:10,760
Mr. Chang.

2869
02:29:10,940 --> 02:29:11,800
Sorry, I first named it.

2870
02:29:12,040 --> 02:29:13,680
Mr. Chang, it's...

2871
02:29:13,680 --> 02:29:15,440
It's friendship, right?

2872
02:29:16,920 --> 02:29:20,420
Right, Mr. Chang?

2873
02:29:24,280 --> 02:29:25,360
Yeah, friendship.

2874
02:29:25,980 --> 02:29:27,400
I haven't, like, done... Okay.

2875
02:29:27,700 --> 02:29:29,520
Restores health by 5%.

2876
02:29:29,520 --> 02:29:31,860
I need, like, health fucking things.

2877
02:29:32,740 --> 02:29:33,040
Okay.

2878
02:29:33,040 --> 02:29:35,980
Lose health recovery when using a meat bun.

2879
02:29:36,240 --> 02:29:38,280
Oh, I feel like that one is still the best.

2880
02:29:38,420 --> 02:29:38,600
Yeah.

2881
02:29:39,520 --> 02:29:41,420
The restore thing is still...

2882
02:29:41,420 --> 02:29:44,460
Yeah, they were just really good friends, right guys?

2883
02:29:45,120 --> 02:29:45,580
Just...

2884
02:29:48,680 --> 02:29:50,600
Just good friends, guys.

2885
02:29:50,660 --> 02:29:51,760
Just good friends.

2886
02:29:52,140 --> 02:29:53,000
Okay, let's see.

2887
02:29:53,100 --> 02:29:54,520
Now we can do the Chao Chao one.

2888
02:29:55,040 --> 02:29:55,920
Is that the other ones?

2889
02:29:55,980 --> 02:29:57,500
Okay, so apparently...

2890
02:29:57,500 --> 02:30:00,040
We can pay for Yang...

2891
02:30:01,320 --> 02:30:04,220
Yu-Jin with the... Okay, we can...

2892
02:30:04,220 --> 02:30:07,380
We can pay for him, but I don't really want to pay for him.

2893
02:30:07,760 --> 02:30:09,040
He wants the staff, right?

2894
02:30:09,300 --> 02:30:10,980
Okay, spear and staff.

2895
02:30:11,480 --> 02:30:13,080
Alright, we'll do staff first.

2896
02:30:15,360 --> 02:30:16,620
Where's my staff?

2897
02:30:17,440 --> 02:30:18,100
There it is.

2898
02:30:18,160 --> 02:30:18,620
92.

2899
02:30:19,280 --> 02:30:22,540
Okay, he just wants battle arts, so I do have battle arts for that.

2900
02:30:26,460 --> 02:30:26,860
Uh...

2901
02:30:28,700 --> 02:30:30,340
Wait, did I fucked it up?

2902
02:30:30,460 --> 02:30:31,060
Oh, I did.

2903
02:30:31,200 --> 02:30:32,440
Okay, we put this here.

2904
02:30:33,300 --> 02:30:36,120
And then... arrow, retribution, what's this?

2905
02:30:36,480 --> 02:30:36,880
Whoa!

2906
02:30:37,500 --> 02:30:38,400
Wait, that's so cool.

2907
02:30:38,940 --> 02:30:40,300
But I don't want to use it.

2908
02:30:40,780 --> 02:30:42,240
Actually, no, I should use it.

2909
02:30:42,320 --> 02:30:43,080
That looked cool.

2910
02:30:43,620 --> 02:30:44,020
Alright.

2911
02:30:45,120 --> 02:30:46,020
Okay, nice.

2912
02:30:47,360 --> 02:30:48,020
Wait, I have nothing.

2913
02:30:48,120 --> 02:30:49,040
Do I have nothing in here?

2914
02:30:49,460 --> 02:30:50,460
No, I have the strength pill.

2915
02:30:50,480 --> 02:30:51,740
I can put another thing in here...

2916
02:30:51,740 --> 02:30:53,160
that I don't use anyway.

2917
02:30:53,960 --> 02:30:56,580
Restore his health by 70% for you.

2918
02:30:56,600 --> 02:30:57,760
Oh wait, we should get that.

2919
02:31:00,480 --> 02:31:02,240
Oh wait, no, we should do this.

2920
02:31:02,960 --> 02:31:03,240
Alright.

2921
02:31:04,900 --> 02:31:06,840
Finally, we're gonna use the staff.

2922
02:31:08,980 --> 02:31:11,220
Uh... where was the Wu thing again?

2923
02:31:12,080 --> 02:31:14,900
Where was my battle of siege?

2924
02:31:15,020 --> 02:31:15,740
Okay, there you go.

2925
02:31:16,100 --> 02:31:17,220
It's the Yang province.

2926
02:31:20,730 --> 02:31:21,710
Alright, there you go.

2927
02:31:21,850 --> 02:31:22,890
Sorry, I'm back now.

2928
02:31:22,890 --> 02:31:25,550
I'm back to actually do this mission now, TaoTao.

2929
02:31:26,050 --> 02:31:27,210
Sorry about that.

2930
02:31:27,770 --> 02:31:28,910
I had a detour.

2931
02:31:29,670 --> 02:31:30,410
With Cheng Gong.

2932
02:31:32,710 --> 02:31:34,770
Alright guys, before... actually, before...

2933
02:31:34,770 --> 02:31:36,510
Oh, I fucking... oh, they...

2934
02:31:36,510 --> 02:31:38,710
Oh, I don't get the battle... okay, that's fine.

2935
02:31:38,790 --> 02:31:40,270
We don't need that information.

2936
02:31:40,450 --> 02:31:41,210
We just go in.

2937
02:31:41,550 --> 02:31:42,790
Okay, so...

2938
02:31:42,790 --> 02:31:47,090
Before I go in, I was so obsessed with Sans and Papyrus...

2939
02:31:47,090 --> 02:31:48,830
That, like...

2940
02:31:48,830 --> 02:31:51,170
You know those parody songs?

2941
02:31:51,610 --> 02:31:53,090
Where they use their...

2942
02:31:54,050 --> 02:31:56,070
Like that?

2943
02:31:56,530 --> 02:31:58,490
I was so obsessed with it.

2944
02:31:58,870 --> 02:32:01,090
That I have songs of...

2945
02:32:01,850 --> 02:32:03,330
On my iPhone.

2946
02:32:03,830 --> 02:32:04,950
Where I download it.

2947
02:32:05,050 --> 02:32:07,210
Where they did Drop Pop Candy.

2948
02:32:07,750 --> 02:32:09,310
So I'm not gonna play it.

2949
02:32:09,350 --> 02:32:11,430
Because I think I'll get demonetized.

2950
02:32:11,650 --> 02:32:14,450
Well, I don't know if I'm gonna get demonetized for the other stuff I played.

2951
02:32:18,570 --> 02:32:19,770
By the way, let me...

2952
02:32:19,770 --> 02:32:21,330
Okay, I'm gonna... I'll link it.

2953
02:32:21,410 --> 02:32:23,990
But I was so obsessed that I was listening...

2954
02:32:23,990 --> 02:32:25,010
To, like...

2955
02:32:25,010 --> 02:32:26,490
But the thing is, I have, like...

2956
02:32:26,490 --> 02:32:28,550
A version of them technically singing.

2957
02:32:31,830 --> 02:32:32,630
Okay, so...

2958
02:32:33,390 --> 02:32:33,790
There's...

2959
02:32:34,490 --> 02:32:35,930
Oh my god, I'm, like, listening.

2960
02:32:36,110 --> 02:32:39,070
I feel so cringed.

2961
02:32:42,050 --> 02:32:43,570
So, I, like...

2962
02:32:44,950 --> 02:32:45,350
Unironically...

2963
02:32:45,350 --> 02:32:47,690
Listened to these songs.

2964
02:32:50,370 --> 02:32:53,190
And they have, like, other stuff.

2965
02:32:53,570 --> 02:32:54,670
So I...

2966
02:32:55,710 --> 02:32:56,470
Unironically...

2967
02:32:58,530 --> 02:32:59,670
Actually enjoyed...

2968
02:33:00,050 --> 02:33:01,410
The songs.

2969
02:33:04,470 --> 02:33:06,110
There's, like, no lyrics.

2970
02:33:06,250 --> 02:33:07,350
They're just going like...

2971
02:33:08,050 --> 02:33:08,610
Uh...

2972
02:33:13,710 --> 02:33:15,430
So, I actually...

2973
02:33:15,430 --> 02:33:16,930
I actually, like...

2974
02:33:16,930 --> 02:33:18,910
Saved it on...

2975
02:33:18,910 --> 02:33:21,730
I saved it on my phone.

2976
02:33:21,810 --> 02:33:22,630
And everything.

2977
02:33:23,290 --> 02:33:24,190
So, yeah.

2978
02:33:24,330 --> 02:33:24,650
Anyway.

2979
02:33:25,390 --> 02:33:27,470
Anyway, back to Dynasty Warriors.

2980
02:33:29,970 --> 02:33:30,530
Alright.

2981
02:33:31,150 --> 02:33:33,430
Yeah, I wanna know... Actually, I should know what I wanna do.

2982
02:33:33,590 --> 02:33:34,550
I, like, skipped that.

2983
02:33:38,170 --> 02:33:39,590
Okay, what do I have to do?

2984
02:33:49,930 --> 02:33:50,790
Uh... Okay.

2985
02:33:52,670 --> 02:33:54,170
Where do I go?

2986
02:33:55,330 --> 02:33:56,570
Let's move on to details.

2987
02:34:07,350 --> 02:34:09,950
However, staying purely defensive would be a waste of time.

2988
02:34:10,070 --> 02:34:13,270
We'll use the terrain to our advantage to seek an opportunity to counterattack.

2989
02:34:14,190 --> 02:34:15,510
To a critical location.

2990
02:34:15,630 --> 02:34:17,810
The high ground... Okay, I'll get...

2991
02:34:17,810 --> 02:34:18,750
I'll go to the right.

2992
02:34:19,870 --> 02:34:24,110
By controlling these plants, we can launch a large-scale attack on the enemies en route.

2993
02:34:25,590 --> 02:34:27,010
Oh, I'll go to the left then.

2994
02:34:27,050 --> 02:34:27,950
Why do I have to go to the left?

2995
02:34:30,210 --> 02:34:30,650
Person...

2996
02:34:31,350 --> 02:34:33,210
Head towards the high ground.

2997
02:34:33,770 --> 02:34:36,370
I request that Lord Chahuyuan handle the forest.

2998
02:34:36,370 --> 02:34:37,550
Alright.

2999
02:34:40,270 --> 02:34:40,870
Wait...

3000
02:34:40,870 --> 02:34:42,690
Why did he take all the flamboyancy?

3001
02:34:43,530 --> 02:34:44,510
Of Chahuyuan?

3002
02:34:47,790 --> 02:34:48,390
Alright.

3003
02:34:49,310 --> 02:34:50,630
We can do this.

3004
02:34:53,610 --> 02:34:54,670
I've got the staff.

3005
02:34:54,810 --> 02:34:56,110
We can totally do this.

3006
02:34:59,930 --> 02:35:01,170
Alright, I'll go this way.

3007
02:35:04,110 --> 02:35:04,710
Alright.

3008
02:35:04,710 --> 02:35:05,550
It's okay.

3009
02:35:05,750 --> 02:35:06,470
We'll be fine.

3010
02:35:06,890 --> 02:35:09,050
They don't have names.

3011
02:35:09,970 --> 02:35:12,510
You know we'll be fine because they have no names.

3012
02:35:15,730 --> 02:35:16,330
Nice.

3013
02:35:16,630 --> 02:35:17,630
Get out of here!

3014
02:35:18,070 --> 02:35:19,690
It's just that easy!

3015
02:35:22,690 --> 02:35:23,050
Okay.

3016
02:35:24,450 --> 02:35:25,570
We gotta get this too.

3017
02:35:27,670 --> 02:35:28,510
Gotta get the base.

3018
02:35:29,810 --> 02:35:31,130
Get over here!

3019
02:35:31,130 --> 02:35:32,310
Oh, fuck no!

3020
02:35:34,070 --> 02:35:35,050
Not the shadows!

3021
02:35:37,410 --> 02:35:38,950
Where do I go?

3022
02:35:42,190 --> 02:35:42,890
No!

3023
02:35:43,290 --> 02:35:44,170
Not the shadows!

3024
02:35:44,210 --> 02:35:45,130
Oh, there it is!

3025
02:35:45,690 --> 02:35:47,190
Oh my god, no!

3026
02:35:47,350 --> 02:35:48,170
The incense!

3027
02:35:54,210 --> 02:35:56,150
They used the incense!

3028
02:35:58,730 --> 02:36:00,750
The goddamn incense!

3029
02:36:06,650 --> 02:36:07,490
Okay.

3030
02:36:07,750 --> 02:36:09,070
Do I have to kill him?

3031
02:36:13,510 --> 02:36:14,590
Okay, nice.

3032
02:36:16,610 --> 02:36:18,350
I'm trying my best!

3033
02:36:22,890 --> 02:36:24,850
I'm trying my best!

3034
02:36:24,890 --> 02:36:26,170
I'm using a staff!

3035
02:36:31,650 --> 02:36:32,530
Okay.

3036
02:36:32,950 --> 02:36:33,570
Okay.

3037
02:36:33,830 --> 02:36:35,150
God, he's so strong!

3038
02:36:36,030 --> 02:36:37,190
Did I do it?

3039
02:36:40,270 --> 02:36:40,710
Nice!

3040
02:36:40,870 --> 02:36:41,490
I did it!

3041
02:36:42,790 --> 02:36:44,090
Okay, nice.

3042
02:36:45,210 --> 02:36:46,990
I detected sorcery.

3043
02:36:51,490 --> 02:36:52,370
Nice.

3044
02:36:54,410 --> 02:36:57,010
My base is mine now!

3045
02:36:57,010 --> 02:36:59,810
All your bases belong to me!

3046
02:37:05,730 --> 02:37:06,230
Okay.

3047
02:37:06,970 --> 02:37:08,590
Okay, I'm here to save you!

3048
02:37:09,110 --> 02:37:10,070
Don't worry, eat your bread!

3049
02:37:13,070 --> 02:37:13,570
Okay,

3050
02:37:17,770 --> 02:37:18,610
we just gotta kill him.

3051
02:37:20,070 --> 02:37:21,310
Don't worry, count it!

3052
02:37:21,430 --> 02:37:22,410
Oh my god!

3053
02:37:22,430 --> 02:37:24,930
Why is everybody dying?!

3054
02:37:28,550 --> 02:37:29,970
Okay, we gotta help.

3055
02:37:30,110 --> 02:37:32,010
Okay, we'll kill him first, and then...

3056
02:37:33,890 --> 02:37:36,570
Backstab her with that weapon!

3057
02:37:40,650 --> 02:37:41,370
Okay.

3058
02:37:42,810 --> 02:37:43,710
Nice, we got him.

3059
02:37:44,930 --> 02:37:45,650
Okay.

3060
02:37:46,170 --> 02:37:47,190
Get out of here.

3061
02:37:50,150 --> 02:37:52,190
They're throwing rocks?!

3062
02:37:53,430 --> 02:37:55,110
Okay, this is bad.

3063
02:37:55,110 --> 02:37:55,430
Okay.

3064
02:37:55,770 --> 02:37:57,250
This is actually bad.

3065
02:37:58,730 --> 02:37:59,110
Alright.

3066
02:38:00,410 --> 02:38:01,610
Okay, we gotta go this way.

3067
02:38:02,410 --> 02:38:04,650
Oh wait, no, we're throwing rocks!

3068
02:38:04,730 --> 02:38:05,590
Oh, thank god!

3069
02:38:07,450 --> 02:38:08,110
Thank god!

3070
02:38:11,150 --> 02:38:12,570
I was getting worried.

3071
02:38:14,750 --> 02:38:15,390
Oh no.

3072
02:38:15,810 --> 02:38:17,610
Oh no, I need to save Chow Chow!

3073
02:38:19,810 --> 02:38:20,370
No!

3074
02:38:20,690 --> 02:38:23,410
Wait, I have to fucking save Chow Chow!

3075
02:38:23,410 --> 02:38:24,630
Give me a sec!

3076
02:38:24,770 --> 02:38:27,230
There's an entire army heading over!

3077
02:38:30,750 --> 02:38:33,650
Give me a sec, I'm trying to- Oh my god!

3078
02:38:36,470 --> 02:38:37,030
Okay.

3079
02:38:37,710 --> 02:38:38,850
Okay, we made it.

3080
02:38:38,950 --> 02:38:39,830
We made it, guys.

3081
02:38:40,510 --> 02:38:41,610
We made it.

3082
02:38:41,830 --> 02:38:43,970
There's too many things to do!

3083
02:38:48,210 --> 02:38:49,330
Jesus Christ.

3084
02:38:53,410 --> 02:38:55,410
Why are you guys all so pathetic?!

3085
02:38:57,290 --> 02:38:59,410
You had to do everything?!

3086
02:39:00,890 --> 02:39:01,930
Jesus Christ.

3087
02:39:08,370 --> 02:39:10,170
Oh my god, please!

3088
02:39:10,590 --> 02:39:11,990
What do you mean?!

3089
02:39:11,990 --> 02:39:14,170
That was your entire job, Chow Chow!

3090
02:39:14,310 --> 02:39:18,210
I can't be everywhere!

3091
02:39:19,770 --> 02:39:21,010
Oh my god.

3092
02:39:21,010 --> 02:39:24,210
I can't be everywhere, what do you mean?!

3093
02:39:24,210 --> 02:39:26,650
Okay, we did the- We did that.

3094
02:39:26,870 --> 02:39:30,090
And now, okay, we did the- What does Alsace need?

3095
02:39:30,150 --> 02:39:30,810
He needs a spear.

3096
02:39:30,970 --> 02:39:32,270
Okay, that's fine.

3097
02:39:33,570 --> 02:39:34,570
Where's my spear?

3098
02:39:35,450 --> 02:39:36,490
Where is it?

3099
02:39:38,350 --> 02:39:40,910
Oh my god, it's weaker though.

3100
02:39:41,950 --> 02:39:43,170
It's fucking weaker.

3101
02:39:43,650 --> 02:39:45,130
Oh my god, he fucking did it.

3102
02:39:45,170 --> 02:39:46,230
I'm so proud of him.

3103
02:39:46,930 --> 02:39:48,530
I'm so proud of him.

3104
02:39:48,530 --> 02:39:50,510
He fucking did it.

3105
02:39:51,370 --> 02:39:51,710
Alright.

3106
02:39:52,350 --> 02:39:53,130
We did it.

3107
02:39:53,790 --> 02:39:54,330
Get out.

3108
02:39:54,750 --> 02:39:56,190
Get out, I killed all your leaders.

3109
02:39:56,410 --> 02:39:57,110
Get out of here.

3110
02:39:57,650 --> 02:39:59,210
I killed all of them.

3111
02:40:00,490 --> 02:40:02,230
Surely you'll recover now.

3112
02:40:03,170 --> 02:40:04,450
Surely you'll be okay.

3113
02:40:08,090 --> 02:40:10,290
Alright, now we get this base back.

3114
02:40:11,750 --> 02:40:12,310
Okay.

3115
02:40:13,390 --> 02:40:14,210
It's fine.

3116
02:40:15,490 --> 02:40:17,730
I just need to do this the whole time.

3117
02:40:20,010 --> 02:40:21,290
Get out of here.

3118
02:40:21,910 --> 02:40:23,650
I just need this base.

3119
02:40:25,370 --> 02:40:25,890
You know what?

3120
02:40:25,990 --> 02:40:26,470
Fuck it.

3121
02:40:27,530 --> 02:40:28,330
Go dragons!

3122
02:40:28,670 --> 02:40:29,510
Do something!

3123
02:40:32,530 --> 02:40:33,750
That's all I want!

3124
02:40:33,930 --> 02:40:34,630
Anything!

3125
02:40:36,550 --> 02:40:38,010
Just do something!

3126
02:40:38,270 --> 02:40:39,310
Oh my god.

3127
02:40:39,950 --> 02:40:41,290
Get out of here.

3128
02:40:41,710 --> 02:40:44,550
Just do anything!

3129
02:40:44,550 --> 02:40:46,070
That's all I ask!

3130
02:40:48,110 --> 02:40:48,950
Oh shit.

3131
02:40:51,810 --> 02:40:52,730
You know what?

3132
02:40:52,990 --> 02:40:53,570
Fuck it.

3133
02:40:54,270 --> 02:40:54,930
Fuck it.

3134
02:40:56,310 --> 02:40:57,970
I can get it back easily.

3135
02:41:00,470 --> 02:41:01,270
There you go.

3136
02:41:01,350 --> 02:41:02,590
That's all he did?!

3137
02:41:03,910 --> 02:41:04,810
That's it?!

3138
02:41:05,110 --> 02:41:05,990
That's fine.

3139
02:41:06,130 --> 02:41:06,630
That's fine.

3140
02:41:06,730 --> 02:41:07,190
That's fine.

3141
02:41:09,250 --> 02:41:10,150
That's alright.

3142
02:41:11,550 --> 02:41:12,110
Alright.

3143
02:41:12,470 --> 02:41:13,290
Oh shit.

3144
02:41:14,570 --> 02:41:16,370
Okay, he's almost dead though.

3145
02:41:16,950 --> 02:41:20,070
Oh, you're so strong for someone with no name!

3146
02:41:21,250 --> 02:41:22,390
I hate that.

3147
02:41:22,750 --> 02:41:26,770
I hate that he actually has no name, but he's so fucking strong.

3148
02:41:27,790 --> 02:41:28,870
Like, that's bullshit.

3149
02:41:31,870 --> 02:41:34,650
You should not have so much strength in you.

3150
02:41:34,750 --> 02:41:36,430
You don't even have a fucking name.

3151
02:41:38,330 --> 02:41:38,670
Okay.

3152
02:41:39,370 --> 02:41:40,050
Nice.

3153
02:41:43,630 --> 02:41:44,550
Okay, nice.

3154
02:41:45,310 --> 02:41:46,290
Get counted.

3155
02:41:46,890 --> 02:41:48,250
That's fucking right, get counted.

3156
02:41:51,150 --> 02:41:53,470
That's right, I'm just using my Y combo.

3157
02:41:55,270 --> 02:41:56,550
That's fucking right.

3158
02:41:58,370 --> 02:41:59,970
That's right, get over here!

3159
02:42:00,610 --> 02:42:01,590
Get over here!

3160
02:42:02,950 --> 02:42:03,870
No, exactly!

3161
02:42:03,870 --> 02:42:07,110
You have no- You don't have a name!

3162
02:42:08,710 --> 02:42:10,510
You should not be that strong!

3163
02:42:13,170 --> 02:42:13,930
Okay.

3164
02:42:14,390 --> 02:42:15,050
Nice.

3165
02:42:16,910 --> 02:42:17,310
Fine.

3166
02:42:17,590 --> 02:42:18,150
Explode.

3167
02:42:19,370 --> 02:42:20,130
Alright.

3168
02:42:20,630 --> 02:42:23,530
Okay, well he couldn't do the simple chorus mission.

3169
02:42:23,990 --> 02:42:24,970
That's fine.

3170
02:42:25,670 --> 02:42:33,410
I have to go fucking protect- I have to protect fucking Tao Tao and you can't even do that for me.

3171
02:42:34,370 --> 02:42:34,910
Yen.

3172
02:42:36,490 --> 02:42:38,250
I don't ask for much, Yen!

3173
02:42:40,430 --> 02:42:42,330
I don't fucking ask for much!

3174
02:42:44,770 --> 02:42:48,530
Just needed you to do one thing for me, buddy!

3175
02:42:50,390 --> 02:42:51,850
Just one thing!

3176
02:42:56,090 --> 02:42:56,770
Okay.

3177
02:42:58,470 --> 02:42:59,290
There you go.

3178
02:43:00,690 --> 02:43:01,470
There you go.

3179
02:43:01,570 --> 02:43:01,910
He's dead.

3180
02:43:02,250 --> 02:43:02,970
Wait, no he's not.

3181
02:43:03,050 --> 02:43:03,650
Now he's dead.

3182
02:43:05,230 --> 02:43:06,490
Now he's dead!

3183
02:43:07,550 --> 02:43:10,290
He's like literally- No, he's actually in a mosh pit right now.

3184
02:43:10,990 --> 02:43:15,190
I gotta try my best to fucking protect him!

3185
02:43:15,370 --> 02:43:15,570
Okay.

3186
02:43:16,270 --> 02:43:18,830
I guess we'll do the chorus then.

3187
02:43:21,750 --> 02:43:23,030
Yeah, Yen's gone.

3188
02:43:24,130 --> 02:43:26,530
He couldn't do like one thing for me.

3189
02:43:26,530 --> 02:43:34,730
Literally, all we asked was for Yen to do that one thing and he couldn't do it.

3190
02:43:35,130 --> 02:43:40,670
Actually, since he's dead already, I might as well- He's dead anyway, so I might as well help Cheng Gong.

3191
02:43:42,670 --> 02:43:43,910
Oh, look at that!

3192
02:43:44,190 --> 02:43:46,330
I don't even have to help him!

3193
02:43:49,150 --> 02:43:49,750
Wow!

3194
02:43:50,550 --> 02:43:51,150
Nevermind!

3195
02:43:52,090 --> 02:43:54,770
Unlike Yen, he's actually reliable!

3196
02:43:55,470 --> 02:43:56,090
Wow!

3197
02:43:57,670 --> 02:43:58,910
That's crazy!

3198
02:44:01,190 --> 02:44:01,810
Wow!

3199
02:44:02,130 --> 02:44:03,410
He was active!

3200
02:44:03,750 --> 02:44:05,050
Good job!

3201
02:44:07,150 --> 02:44:08,370
Who would've thought?

3202
02:44:08,490 --> 02:44:09,250
Oh god, please.

3203
02:44:09,390 --> 02:44:09,910
Please live.

3204
02:44:10,230 --> 02:44:10,790
Please live.

3205
02:44:11,090 --> 02:44:12,190
PC, please live.

3206
02:44:12,510 --> 02:44:12,750
Please!

3207
02:44:13,950 --> 02:44:15,950
I can't do this again!

3208
02:44:19,230 --> 02:44:20,110
Oh god.

3209
02:44:20,530 --> 02:44:23,030
Every time I get PTSD- No, you guys don't understand.

3210
02:44:23,250 --> 02:44:26,650
I get PTSD every time I become a true warrior.

3211
02:44:27,130 --> 02:44:32,310
I- I get PTSD every time.

3212
02:44:33,290 --> 02:44:34,730
Just a sea of yellow.

3213
02:44:37,710 --> 02:44:38,670
That's fucking right!

3214
02:44:40,550 --> 02:44:41,230
That's right!

3215
02:44:43,370 --> 02:44:45,070
Get absolutely destroyed!

3216
02:44:47,110 --> 02:44:48,250
There we go.

3217
02:44:50,950 --> 02:44:52,210
Get out of here!

3218
02:44:52,430 --> 02:44:55,470
You think you're better than me?!

3219
02:44:55,470 --> 02:44:56,530
Get out!

3220
02:44:57,750 --> 02:44:58,930
Oh shit, I'm too far.

3221
02:44:59,570 --> 02:45:00,750
It's gonna hit them, right?

3222
02:45:01,210 --> 02:45:01,550
Please!

3223
02:45:02,850 --> 02:45:03,910
Get out!

3224
02:45:05,870 --> 02:45:06,290
Oh, nice.

3225
02:45:07,870 --> 02:45:08,470
Goodbye!

3226
02:45:09,530 --> 02:45:13,330
You are a true- Frozen, thank you for the super chat!

3227
02:45:13,650 --> 02:45:14,930
Thank you, thank you!

3228
02:45:17,510 --> 02:45:18,570
That's fucking right.

3229
02:45:19,110 --> 02:45:19,670
Nice!

3230
02:45:23,810 --> 02:45:24,570
We did it.

3231
02:45:25,570 --> 02:45:26,990
It's just that easy.

3232
02:45:27,770 --> 02:45:28,870
We fucking did it.

3233
02:45:30,670 --> 02:45:33,230
We did the thing that Yuan couldn't do.

3234
02:45:37,130 --> 02:45:38,010
Wait, what?

3235
02:45:38,550 --> 02:45:39,590
God damn it!

3236
02:45:42,310 --> 02:45:43,250
Okay, we have to go back.

3237
02:45:45,430 --> 02:45:46,850
We have to go back.

3238
02:45:46,950 --> 02:45:49,350
We have to- No, please!

3239
02:45:50,330 --> 02:45:51,650
Oh my god!

3240
02:45:53,590 --> 02:45:54,150
Oh no.

3241
02:45:56,070 --> 02:45:56,710
Oh no.

3242
02:45:57,550 --> 02:46:00,350
I'm riding my horse as fast as I can.

3243
02:46:00,670 --> 02:46:01,890
Oh my god!

3244
02:46:02,130 --> 02:46:04,370
Oh my fucking god!

3245
02:46:05,070 --> 02:46:07,310
It's like a sea of ants!

3246
02:46:07,310 --> 02:46:07,970
What?

3247
02:46:10,850 --> 02:46:11,950
Holy shit!

3248
02:46:12,890 --> 02:46:15,430
It's like a fucking sea of ants!

3249
02:46:17,110 --> 02:46:18,470
That's crazy!

3250
02:46:22,930 --> 02:46:24,030
Holy shit!

3251
02:46:24,130 --> 02:46:27,390
Give me a sec, everybody!

3252
02:46:29,150 --> 02:46:31,030
Oh my god!

3253
02:46:31,150 --> 02:46:31,470
Get out!

3254
02:46:33,830 --> 02:46:35,590
Oh my god!

3255
02:46:37,430 --> 02:46:38,850
Oh my god!

3256
02:46:39,090 --> 02:46:41,110
I can't believe it!

3257
02:46:42,010 --> 02:46:42,530
Alright.

3258
02:46:43,290 --> 02:46:44,470
That's fine.

3259
02:46:45,010 --> 02:46:45,710
We did it.

3260
02:46:45,970 --> 02:46:47,290
I don't know how!

3261
02:46:47,690 --> 02:46:49,090
Holy shit!

3262
02:46:49,810 --> 02:46:51,490
Oh my god!

3263
02:46:51,670 --> 02:46:53,690
There's so many of them!

3264
02:46:55,610 --> 02:46:57,790
Look at all this fodder!

3265
02:47:02,950 --> 02:47:05,290
Holy shit, and he's huge!

3266
02:47:06,050 --> 02:47:07,530
That was crazy!

3267
02:47:07,590 --> 02:47:08,090
You know what?

3268
02:47:08,130 --> 02:47:09,230
I'm getting him in here!

3269
02:47:09,810 --> 02:47:11,070
I'm getting him in here!

3270
02:47:11,230 --> 02:47:12,570
Get over here, Shahutan!

3271
02:47:13,110 --> 02:47:14,630
Just kill them all!

3272
02:47:16,110 --> 02:47:17,970
Just kill them all!

3273
02:47:20,830 --> 02:47:22,710
Use your rage mode!

3274
02:47:26,150 --> 02:47:26,950
That's right!

3275
02:47:27,070 --> 02:47:29,150
You made a fucking mistake!

3276
02:47:30,410 --> 02:47:32,530
You made a mistake!

3277
02:47:32,530 --> 02:47:35,790
I brought in the big boys!

3278
02:47:37,090 --> 02:47:39,230
That's fucking right!

3279
02:47:42,950 --> 02:47:46,310
Brought in the big boys in here!

3280
02:47:49,330 --> 02:47:51,150
You can't prevail!

3281
02:47:51,790 --> 02:47:54,270
I am Shahutan with two eyes!

3282
02:47:55,350 --> 02:47:56,990
You think you can prevail?

3283
02:47:59,790 --> 02:48:01,190
I have two eyes!

3284
02:48:04,150 --> 02:48:05,730
Get out of here!

3285
02:48:09,950 --> 02:48:10,990
It's over!

3286
02:48:11,490 --> 02:48:12,590
No, I can't!

3287
02:48:12,750 --> 02:48:12,850
Please!

3288
02:48:13,330 --> 02:48:15,870
Please, I just want to stay!

3289
02:48:16,190 --> 02:48:16,430
I shall!

3290
02:48:16,710 --> 02:48:17,130
Please!

3291
02:48:21,290 --> 02:48:22,770
Oh my god!

3292
02:48:22,890 --> 02:48:24,210
I'm not letting you regroup!

3293
02:48:24,210 --> 02:48:26,050
You think I'm gonna let you regroup?

3294
02:48:26,250 --> 02:48:27,190
Get over here!

3295
02:48:27,970 --> 02:48:29,490
Get your ass over here!

3296
02:48:29,550 --> 02:48:31,610
You live by one HP!

3297
02:48:34,130 --> 02:48:37,290
Can't believe he lived with one HP there!

3298
02:48:47,470 --> 02:48:49,570
We gotta go to point C.

3299
02:48:54,550 --> 02:48:55,390
Nice, alright.

3300
02:48:57,510 --> 02:48:59,290
Okay, we gotta go to point C now.

3301
02:49:01,110 --> 02:49:03,050
Oh my god, so much- NO!

3302
02:49:03,170 --> 02:49:04,030
I didn't mean to fuck!

3303
02:49:04,090 --> 02:49:08,170
I was trying to- I was trying to get my horse!

3304
02:49:08,830 --> 02:49:09,830
God damn it!

3305
02:49:09,930 --> 02:49:10,850
It's okay, we don't need that.

3306
02:49:11,790 --> 02:49:12,890
We don't need it, guys.

3307
02:49:16,090 --> 02:49:16,890
That's right!

3308
02:49:19,590 --> 02:49:20,690
I'm here now!

3309
02:49:27,870 --> 02:49:28,450
Okay.

3310
02:49:29,890 --> 02:49:30,470
Okay.

3311
02:49:30,470 --> 02:49:31,110
We got this!

3312
02:49:31,670 --> 02:49:36,550
There's not a C of them though, so like it's a little harder- Jesus Christ!

3313
02:49:38,990 --> 02:49:39,270
Alright.

3314
02:49:39,850 --> 02:49:42,730
It is a little harder because there's not a C of them!

3315
02:49:46,310 --> 02:49:46,890
Okay.

3316
02:49:47,850 --> 02:49:48,430
127!

3317
02:49:49,370 --> 02:49:50,190
Alright, that's fine.

3318
02:49:53,290 --> 02:49:53,750
Alright.

3319
02:49:53,750 --> 02:49:54,930
Oh my god, Chen gone!

3320
02:49:55,110 --> 02:49:56,670
Oh my god, please eat up, Ren!

3321
02:49:57,450 --> 02:49:57,910
Please!

3322
02:50:05,350 --> 02:50:06,410
Jeez, that's dark.

3323
02:50:06,950 --> 02:50:08,090
Jesus Christ!

3324
02:50:09,510 --> 02:50:10,650
Alright, use your arrows!

3325
02:50:16,190 --> 02:50:17,390
Okay, nice, we did it.

3326
02:50:20,190 --> 02:50:22,150
Just eat your bread, please!

3327
02:50:23,610 --> 02:50:25,170
Oh shit, what the fuck?

3328
02:50:28,110 --> 02:50:28,610
Please!

3329
02:50:31,790 --> 02:50:33,250
Okay, we just need to kill him.

3330
02:50:33,830 --> 02:50:36,010
He seems to be the strongest out of all of them.

3331
02:50:41,170 --> 02:50:41,670
Nice!

3332
02:50:42,910 --> 02:50:43,310
Get out!

3333
02:50:46,010 --> 02:50:46,770
Get out!

3334
02:50:47,310 --> 02:50:49,090
Just gotta kill the strongest guy!

3335
02:50:52,710 --> 02:50:53,990
You think you're gonna run?

3336
02:50:54,870 --> 02:50:56,170
Get over here!

3337
02:50:56,230 --> 02:50:56,770
Oh fuck!

3338
02:50:58,110 --> 02:50:58,910
Get over here!

3339
02:50:59,030 --> 02:51:00,930
I spent so much time trying to kill you!

3340
02:51:01,390 --> 02:51:02,670
Get over here!

3341
02:51:04,930 --> 02:51:08,950
I wasted too much time to kill you for you to run!

3342
02:51:11,170 --> 02:51:11,810
Coward!

3343
02:51:14,090 --> 02:51:15,970
That's right, continue to starve.

3344
02:51:17,770 --> 02:51:19,530
Then you keep starving.

3345
02:51:21,550 --> 02:51:22,730
He's ruining.

3346
02:51:24,190 --> 02:51:24,910
He's ruining!

3347
02:51:27,070 --> 02:51:28,890
Alright, let's take this base too.

3348
02:51:29,130 --> 02:51:29,850
Just for the fun.

3349
02:51:31,250 --> 02:51:33,210
Also, I need to get this.

3350
02:51:36,310 --> 02:51:40,930
I need to get this achievement.

3351
02:51:45,290 --> 02:51:46,370
Okay, nice.

3352
02:51:48,210 --> 02:51:48,630
Nice!

3353
02:51:48,630 --> 02:51:49,270
Get out of here!

3354
02:51:49,470 --> 02:51:51,290
Jesus Christ, you're so tanky!

3355
02:51:51,490 --> 02:51:53,490
If I knew, I wouldn't have fought you!

3356
02:51:53,710 --> 02:51:55,570
I wouldn't have let you stay in your house!

3357
02:51:58,410 --> 02:51:59,230
Alright, nice.

3358
02:52:01,890 --> 02:52:06,210
Oh my god, I wouldn't let him stay if I knew he was this fucking tanky.

3359
02:52:10,370 --> 02:52:11,050
Okay, nice.

3360
02:52:12,070 --> 02:52:12,670
Get out!

3361
02:52:13,510 --> 02:52:14,350
You're cancelled?

3362
02:52:16,230 --> 02:52:17,890
That's what, longer already for you?

3363
02:52:19,170 --> 02:52:20,010
Alright, nice.

3364
02:52:20,530 --> 02:52:20,750
Easy.

3365
02:52:23,670 --> 02:52:24,230
Okay.

3366
02:52:25,050 --> 02:52:26,590
I need this combo though.

3367
02:52:28,090 --> 02:52:28,810
Oh, nice!

3368
02:52:28,890 --> 02:52:29,370
2,000!

3369
02:52:29,570 --> 02:52:30,070
Oh, please!

3370
02:52:30,270 --> 02:52:30,890
Please live!

3371
02:52:31,250 --> 02:52:31,810
Please live!

3372
02:52:32,230 --> 02:52:34,790
I don't wanna be a true warrior!

3373
02:52:35,230 --> 02:52:35,790
Please!

3374
02:52:36,290 --> 02:52:39,210
Please VC, I don't wanna be a true warrior!

3375
02:52:39,850 --> 02:52:41,470
I- I swear to god!

3376
02:52:41,710 --> 02:52:42,790
Okay, nice, nice.

3377
02:52:42,870 --> 02:52:44,290
We completed...

3378
02:52:45,290 --> 02:52:46,550
Did we complete all of it?

3379
02:52:46,990 --> 02:52:47,390
Nice.

3380
02:52:48,050 --> 02:52:48,850
Zero training.

3381
02:52:49,050 --> 02:52:50,470
Nice, I didn't have to pay for it too.

3382
02:52:51,170 --> 02:52:51,970
Thank god.

3383
02:52:52,430 --> 02:52:53,070
Okay, wheels.

3384
02:52:53,310 --> 02:52:53,890
Oh, okay.

3385
02:52:54,010 --> 02:52:54,970
Junhee wants wheels.

3386
02:52:56,030 --> 02:52:57,730
Oh wait, he wants- Wait, did I finish?

3387
02:52:58,090 --> 02:52:59,970
Okay, I think- Mounted charge.

3388
02:53:01,010 --> 02:53:01,810
And then...

3389
02:53:01,810 --> 02:53:03,230
Completed battle arts.

3390
02:53:03,310 --> 02:53:04,590
Okay, now I need to use the wheel.

3391
02:53:06,310 --> 02:53:06,990
Okay, nice.

3392
02:53:07,030 --> 02:53:07,970
My favorite weapon.

3393
02:53:07,970 --> 02:53:08,670
At least.

3394
02:53:12,450 --> 02:53:12,890
Alright.

3395
02:53:15,410 --> 02:53:16,550
Alright, it should be 5.

3396
02:53:17,970 --> 02:53:19,470
Was it that- Was it really that it?

3397
02:53:20,630 --> 02:53:21,710
Uh, oh wait.

3398
02:53:22,070 --> 02:53:24,010
Uh, mounted...

3399
02:53:25,330 --> 02:53:26,430
What was the other one?

3400
02:53:27,350 --> 02:53:28,190
Battle arts with wheels.

3401
02:53:28,310 --> 02:53:29,210
Okay, I can do that.

3402
02:53:31,110 --> 02:53:32,450
Wait, I went the wrong way.

3403
02:53:34,010 --> 02:53:36,010
Oh wait, I missed that horse stance.

3404
02:53:36,050 --> 02:53:36,950
Not gonna lie.

3405
02:53:37,450 --> 02:53:40,690
The horse stance- Cause I can like control that horse easier.

3406
02:53:41,910 --> 02:53:44,090
Uh, Fuzzy, thank you for the super chat.

3407
02:53:44,190 --> 02:53:45,270
Thank you, thank you.

3408
02:53:45,430 --> 02:53:47,030
If the yellow termans wanted to win...

3409
02:53:47,910 --> 02:53:51,890
Uh, they would- I said I'm- General.

3410
02:53:55,010 --> 02:53:56,930
Fuzzy, thank you for the super chat.

3411
02:53:57,030 --> 02:53:58,150
Thank you, thank you.

3412
02:53:58,910 --> 02:53:59,950
I mean, it's not wrong.

3413
02:54:00,570 --> 02:54:01,970
It's not wrong.

3414
02:54:05,230 --> 02:54:05,830
Alright.

3415
02:54:07,190 --> 02:54:07,390
Alright.

3416
02:54:07,390 --> 02:54:08,630
Do I just have to kill all of them?

3417
02:54:08,830 --> 02:54:10,090
Oh my god, I guess I do.

3418
02:54:11,670 --> 02:54:12,610
That's fine.

3419
02:54:16,290 --> 02:54:18,710
With all my might, let's fucking go.

3420
02:54:20,930 --> 02:54:22,130
Jesus Christ.

3421
02:54:22,990 --> 02:54:24,430
That is so strong.

3422
02:54:25,670 --> 02:54:27,450
That's actually crazy.

3423
02:54:28,510 --> 02:54:30,590
How strong that attack is.

3424
02:54:32,350 --> 02:54:34,990
Oh my god, they're just dead.

3425
02:54:35,390 --> 02:54:36,570
Get over here.

3426
02:54:39,370 --> 02:54:40,630
Get outta here.

3427
02:54:41,870 --> 02:54:45,490
Oh my god, I might hit 3,000 at this point.

3428
02:54:47,170 --> 02:54:49,670
Like, I'm just running in, mowing them down.

3429
02:54:50,570 --> 02:54:52,830
Like, I'm literally a long mower right now.

3430
02:54:53,210 --> 02:54:56,990
All these poor men who's gonna have widows.

3431
02:54:57,670 --> 02:54:58,970
They're just standing there.

3432
02:55:00,230 --> 02:55:03,330
They're just letting me send my things out.

3433
02:55:05,730 --> 02:55:07,270
Oh shit, wrong one.

3434
02:55:08,950 --> 02:55:09,350
Nice.

3435
02:55:10,450 --> 02:55:11,550
Alright, get over here.

3436
02:55:11,830 --> 02:55:13,590
The mower is here now.

3437
02:55:17,630 --> 02:55:17,970
Bye.

3438
02:55:19,610 --> 02:55:22,290
These men are amazing for us.

3439
02:55:24,390 --> 02:55:26,470
So many widows today.

3440
02:55:26,470 --> 02:55:28,670
So many.

3441
02:55:32,510 --> 02:55:33,730
Jesus.

3442
02:55:34,850 --> 02:55:39,130
Look at all these widows that's gonna happen.

3443
02:55:40,310 --> 02:55:41,410
There's more?

3444
02:55:42,150 --> 02:55:45,130
Oh my god, they're just standing there.

3445
02:55:46,370 --> 02:55:49,170
Ready to be mowed down.

3446
02:55:54,970 --> 02:55:57,310
Oh my god, I'm not even halfway.

3447
02:55:57,650 --> 02:56:01,250
I'm not even halfway to the large central force.

3448
02:56:01,750 --> 02:56:05,130
Like, holy shit.

3449
02:56:06,850 --> 02:56:07,910
I'm just swinging.

3450
02:56:08,110 --> 02:56:08,870
I'm at 3.

3451
02:56:08,990 --> 02:56:10,650
I'm gonna be at 3k.

3452
02:56:12,990 --> 02:56:14,250
I am the widow maker.

3453
02:56:14,890 --> 02:56:17,210
I shall become the widow maker now.

3454
02:56:18,670 --> 02:56:22,110
Okay, there has to be like an easier way to do it.

3455
02:56:22,170 --> 02:56:24,010
Okay, there's like a huge patch of people here.

3456
02:56:24,510 --> 02:56:30,130
Okay, my new patch of men to mow down.

3457
02:56:32,490 --> 02:56:33,010
Nice.

3458
02:56:33,690 --> 02:56:35,410
Did I not finish it yet?

3459
02:56:35,510 --> 02:56:37,050
How much do I have?

3460
02:56:39,870 --> 02:56:40,530
Oh, 100.

3461
02:56:40,790 --> 02:56:42,030
Okay, almost there.

3462
02:56:44,250 --> 02:56:45,630
Guys, I'm not even halfway.

3463
02:56:48,330 --> 02:56:49,950
Wait, I can just kill the officers?

3464
02:56:50,730 --> 02:56:53,490
Wait, wait, what do you- Okay, goodbye.

3465
02:56:53,630 --> 02:56:54,090
I'm leaving.

3466
02:56:56,130 --> 02:56:57,490
I'm going in.

3467
02:56:57,790 --> 02:56:58,290
Goodbye.

3468
02:57:02,530 --> 02:57:03,410
I'm leaving.

3469
02:57:05,090 --> 02:57:05,830
I'm leaving.

3470
02:57:10,450 --> 02:57:11,290
I'm leaving.

3471
02:57:11,290 --> 02:57:11,510
I'm leaving.

3472
02:57:13,810 --> 02:57:15,170
I'm fucking leaving.

3473
02:57:15,630 --> 02:57:16,050
Goodbye.

3474
02:57:17,210 --> 02:57:18,230
Wait, how do I get there?

3475
02:57:18,550 --> 02:57:19,370
Oh, it's right here.

3476
02:57:21,490 --> 02:57:22,110
Goodbye.

3477
02:57:23,910 --> 02:57:24,530
Goodbye.

3478
02:57:24,910 --> 02:57:25,850
I'm here now.

3479
02:57:26,650 --> 02:57:27,890
I'm here now.

3480
02:57:28,430 --> 02:57:31,010
I just noticed how low my HP was.

3481
02:57:31,850 --> 02:57:33,790
I'm here to mow the lawn.

3482
02:57:35,310 --> 02:57:36,630
Get over here.

3483
02:57:38,250 --> 02:57:39,250
It's time.

3484
02:57:43,900 --> 02:57:45,040
Jesus Christ.

3485
02:57:45,400 --> 02:57:47,480
Oh, this is my favorite weapon too.

3486
02:57:50,120 --> 02:57:51,460
Get out of here.

3487
02:57:51,980 --> 02:57:54,640
You shall be my 3000 kills.

3488
02:57:56,940 --> 02:57:57,680
Whoa, what?

3489
02:57:58,420 --> 02:57:59,980
Oh, he said that.

3490
02:58:01,820 --> 02:58:04,700
Can't starve if you're already dead.

3491
02:58:11,930 --> 02:58:14,070
Defeat a thousand enemies?

3492
02:58:14,410 --> 02:58:16,950
What else was I doing just then?

3493
02:58:21,550 --> 02:58:24,450
Have I not done that?

3494
02:58:26,130 --> 02:58:27,110
Oh no.

3495
02:58:27,310 --> 02:58:28,590
In two minutes.

3496
02:58:29,030 --> 02:58:30,490
In two minutes.

3497
02:58:32,710 --> 02:58:34,010
Oh my god.

3498
02:58:34,210 --> 02:58:34,490
Okay.

3499
02:58:36,730 --> 02:58:37,570
Okay, please.

3500
02:58:37,850 --> 02:58:38,310
Please, PC.

3501
02:58:38,630 --> 02:58:38,970
Please.

3502
02:58:39,190 --> 02:58:39,510
Please.

3503
02:58:39,670 --> 02:58:40,310
Please live.

3504
02:58:40,310 --> 02:58:41,290
Please live.

3505
02:58:44,350 --> 02:58:44,990
Oh my god.

3506
02:58:45,010 --> 02:58:46,050
I almost have Shao Hu done.

3507
02:58:49,410 --> 02:58:50,450
Jesus Christ.

3508
02:58:56,950 --> 02:58:57,990
He like...

3509
02:58:57,990 --> 02:59:00,510
I'm pretty sure he took over Zhang.

3510
02:59:00,910 --> 02:59:03,290
He definitely took Zhang.

3511
02:59:03,450 --> 02:59:05,030
He's the bad boy in this there.

3512
02:59:06,910 --> 02:59:07,610
Oh my god, please.

3513
02:59:07,710 --> 02:59:08,570
I'm so close.

3514
02:59:12,230 --> 02:59:13,890
Jesus Christ.

3515
02:59:14,330 --> 02:59:15,850
There's so many.

3516
02:59:16,150 --> 02:59:16,250
No!

3517
02:59:20,070 --> 02:59:21,390
There's so many!

3518
02:59:21,990 --> 02:59:23,170
Oh my god!

3519
02:59:26,870 --> 02:59:28,570
I'm trying my best.

3520
02:59:29,230 --> 02:59:32,070
I'm trying to act my best right now.

3521
02:59:34,270 --> 02:59:36,190
Oh my god!

3522
02:59:36,190 --> 02:59:40,470
How much grass is there?!

3523
02:59:40,470 --> 02:59:41,630
Jesus!

3524
02:59:42,810 --> 02:59:45,030
I'm still going!

3525
02:59:48,580 --> 02:59:50,420
Oh my god, I'm so close.

3526
02:59:52,300 --> 02:59:54,000
Oh my god, we did it!

3527
02:59:58,320 --> 02:59:59,880
Jesus Christ.

3528
03:00:00,460 --> 03:00:01,180
Oh, thank god.

3529
03:00:01,860 --> 03:00:03,040
Oh, thank god.

3530
03:00:07,780 --> 03:00:08,220
Please!

3531
03:00:11,060 --> 03:00:13,240
Get these boom men outta here!

3532
03:00:19,140 --> 03:00:20,360
Oh my god, I can't.

3533
03:00:20,380 --> 03:00:20,780
I can't.

3534
03:00:20,820 --> 03:00:22,280
I'm 1 HP right now.

3535
03:00:26,840 --> 03:00:27,720
Jesus Christ.

3536
03:00:28,300 --> 03:00:29,300
I'm gonna use that.

3537
03:00:29,440 --> 03:00:30,960
Oh my god, I had to use it.

3538
03:00:31,180 --> 03:00:32,580
I had to use it, guys.

3539
03:00:32,720 --> 03:00:33,560
I'm actually...

3540
03:00:33,560 --> 03:00:34,480
I would have died.

3541
03:00:34,480 --> 03:00:36,020
There's so much.

3542
03:00:36,080 --> 03:00:37,280
There's so many.

3543
03:00:37,460 --> 03:00:39,360
I'm at 3,900.

3544
03:00:40,820 --> 03:00:41,300
How?!

3545
03:00:41,300 --> 03:00:42,020
Oh my...

3546
03:00:42,020 --> 03:00:42,540
They're dead.

3547
03:00:42,840 --> 03:00:43,560
They're all dead.

3548
03:00:43,640 --> 03:00:45,040
I have killed millions today.

3549
03:00:45,400 --> 03:00:47,640
They're all dead.

3550
03:00:49,380 --> 03:00:50,980
Jordan, thank you for the super chat.

3551
03:00:51,120 --> 03:00:51,920
Thank you.

3552
03:00:53,640 --> 03:00:54,120
RedCliffWatchLongWin.

3553
03:00:55,660 --> 03:00:57,100
Maybe one day.

3554
03:00:58,440 --> 03:00:59,960
This is actually one of my favorite movies, though.

3555
03:01:00,200 --> 03:01:01,440
Part 1 ends part 2.

3556
03:01:01,440 --> 03:01:01,520
You know?

3557
03:01:02,660 --> 03:01:03,900
We did it, guys.

3558
03:01:07,220 --> 03:01:08,760
We killed millions today.

3559
03:01:08,980 --> 03:01:10,160
But we are an agent.

3560
03:01:10,340 --> 03:01:13,560
Remember, we are an agent of peace, guys.

3561
03:01:13,980 --> 03:01:16,620
What better way to bring peace than with violence?

3562
03:01:17,880 --> 03:01:18,400
Nice!

3563
03:01:18,660 --> 03:01:19,200
Level up.

3564
03:01:22,620 --> 03:01:24,960
Oh my god, 161?

3565
03:01:25,940 --> 03:01:28,100
I completed a lot there.

3566
03:01:28,900 --> 03:01:29,500
For peace.

3567
03:01:29,500 --> 03:01:31,540
For peace, guys.

3568
03:01:34,360 --> 03:01:35,000
Nice.

3569
03:01:35,120 --> 03:01:35,520
Completed.

3570
03:01:35,640 --> 03:01:36,180
Completed.

3571
03:01:36,360 --> 03:01:36,860
Completed.

3572
03:01:37,080 --> 03:01:37,560
Completed.

3573
03:01:37,860 --> 03:01:40,560
I may be able to talk to Junkie.

3574
03:01:45,230 --> 03:01:45,870
Alright.

3575
03:01:46,210 --> 03:01:47,790
And then...

3576
03:01:47,790 --> 03:01:48,550
Boost attack.

3577
03:01:49,350 --> 03:01:49,990
Strength.

3578
03:01:50,690 --> 03:01:51,190
Defense.

3579
03:01:52,570 --> 03:01:54,950
Okay, we definitely need to hold more bugs, though.

3580
03:01:57,570 --> 03:02:00,930
Look at all those orphans and widows that we created, guys.

3581
03:02:01,110 --> 03:02:01,530
Yeah!

3582
03:02:02,690 --> 03:02:04,150
NotSoDeadPool, thank you for the super chat.

3583
03:02:04,230 --> 03:02:05,110
Thank you, thank you.

3584
03:02:05,370 --> 03:02:07,310
Doki is a Three Kingdoms booty warrior.

3585
03:02:07,470 --> 03:02:08,850
Only one type of prize.

3586
03:02:09,070 --> 03:02:09,390
I'm kidding.

3587
03:02:10,470 --> 03:02:12,570
Thank you for the super chat.

3588
03:02:12,710 --> 03:02:13,730
Thank you, thank you.

3589
03:02:19,590 --> 03:02:22,330
Look at his puppy dog eyes.

3590
03:02:22,810 --> 03:02:25,730
He's like, please don't kill me.

3591
03:02:53,230 --> 03:02:55,490
Yeah, but he's different.

3592
03:02:57,830 --> 03:02:59,650
Look at him!

3593
03:03:03,250 --> 03:03:04,310
He's hot.

3594
03:03:05,390 --> 03:03:07,830
Hot people can't commit evil, surely.

3595
03:03:22,690 --> 03:03:24,450
If evil, why hot?

3596
03:03:24,690 --> 03:03:25,250
Exactly.

3597
03:03:25,750 --> 03:03:27,250
Fellas, welcome to The Tomato Farm!

3598
03:03:27,350 --> 03:03:28,030
Welcome, welcome!

3599
03:03:30,330 --> 03:03:30,970
Society.

3600
03:03:32,230 --> 03:03:38,490
One in which we create, protect, and share, rather than live in this endless cycle of stealing.

3601
03:03:39,090 --> 03:03:43,250
If you would like to see such a society, then join us.

3602
03:03:43,930 --> 03:03:46,110
We will give you all something to live for.

3603
03:03:46,950 --> 03:03:51,730
You have my word, as the one who defeated your leader, Zhang Jiao.

3604
03:03:53,450 --> 03:03:55,210
You're not- what?!

3605
03:03:55,210 --> 03:03:57,050
I defeated his leader!

3606
03:03:58,910 --> 03:04:00,550
What are you- what?!

3607
03:04:00,550 --> 03:04:02,050
He just took credit?!

3608
03:04:04,670 --> 03:04:06,050
What do you mean, you?!

3609
03:04:07,750 --> 03:04:10,410
Also, thanks, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

3610
03:04:10,510 --> 03:04:13,390
Hey, Doki, thanks again for mowing my lawn.

3611
03:04:13,590 --> 03:04:18,450
Here's $10, your lawn that's filled with dead people now.

3612
03:04:21,710 --> 03:04:24,870
And I'll take down all million of those.

3613
03:04:28,090 --> 03:04:35,230
They remain a fighting force, but in peacetime, they mostly train and help in the fields.

3614
03:04:35,430 --> 03:04:36,710
Did you get done in this game yet?

3615
03:04:38,210 --> 03:04:40,750
But they are dealing with huge numbers of people.

3616
03:04:41,250 --> 03:04:44,570
If he is, he'll make this game a 10 out of 10.

3617
03:04:46,470 --> 03:04:51,010
Repairing buildings, distributing land ownership, enforcing the law.

3618
03:04:52,730 --> 03:04:55,070
To develop so much in such a short time.

3619
03:04:55,070 --> 03:04:56,190
Look at that Sima Yi.

3620
03:04:56,690 --> 03:04:58,250
He looks less evil.

3621
03:05:01,110 --> 03:05:02,310
There's no way!

3622
03:05:02,570 --> 03:05:02,790
No!

3623
03:05:03,670 --> 03:05:04,030
No!

3624
03:05:04,590 --> 03:05:07,190
That's like that Steve Carell meme.

3625
03:05:07,670 --> 03:05:07,890
No!

3626
03:05:09,390 --> 03:05:13,930
There's no way, I refuse to believe- thank god, I was like, that is not Sima Yi.

3627
03:05:17,870 --> 03:05:21,530
If anybody should look evil, it would have been Sima Yi.

3628
03:05:22,450 --> 03:05:25,010
Yeah, I was gonna say, that looks like Jun Yu.

3629
03:05:25,170 --> 03:05:26,670
I was like, there's no way.

3630
03:05:57,530 --> 03:05:58,650
Who's the other guy?

3631
03:05:59,210 --> 03:06:00,470
Wait, who's the third guy?

3632
03:06:00,970 --> 03:06:02,110
Where did he come from?

3633
03:06:10,210 --> 03:06:11,450
That's Guo Jia?

3634
03:06:12,030 --> 03:06:12,370
Ji?

3635
03:06:13,610 --> 03:06:14,170
Or Jia?

3636
03:06:14,530 --> 03:06:14,970
Guo Jia?

3637
03:06:14,970 --> 03:06:20,650
It can be fun to watch such a taciturn man loosen up for once.

3638
03:06:22,230 --> 03:06:23,550
He has earrings, what the fuck?

3639
03:06:25,430 --> 03:06:26,650
Yeah, see, I told you.

3640
03:06:27,090 --> 03:06:30,310
Wei has only one Zhou Yu.

3641
03:06:30,590 --> 03:06:32,190
Wu has like 10 of them.

3642
03:06:32,570 --> 03:06:35,750
Like, that's Zhou Yu- that's blue Zhou Yu right there.

3643
03:06:35,910 --> 03:06:38,310
For a moment there, I was ready to die.

3644
03:06:39,810 --> 03:06:43,350
Luckily, a house guest of Wan Yun's came to my rescue.

3645
03:06:44,390 --> 03:06:46,650
We have blue Zhou Yu at home.

3646
03:06:55,170 --> 03:06:55,850
Woah!

3647
03:06:55,850 --> 03:06:57,030
Woah, he's shy!

3648
03:07:02,690 --> 03:07:05,550
Woah, he's like, oh my gosh!

3649
03:07:13,450 --> 03:07:14,810
I am Guo Jia.

3650
03:07:15,410 --> 03:07:19,490
I only just met these two at the governor's castle.

3651
03:07:21,010 --> 03:07:25,430
If you're here in Puyang, does that mean you've entered Lord Zhou's house first?

3652
03:07:25,430 --> 03:07:28,370
He got sober from seeing my face!

3653
03:07:30,830 --> 03:07:32,070
Guo Jia.

3654
03:07:33,030 --> 03:07:35,170
I'm trying to remember what he looks like.

3655
03:07:37,100 --> 03:07:40,290
Oh my god, they added him later, right?

3656
03:07:40,290 --> 03:07:44,030
I don't remember- oh my god, I don't remember him.

3657
03:07:44,130 --> 03:07:45,110
When did they add him?

3658
03:07:46,830 --> 03:07:48,310
When did they add this guy?

3659
03:07:48,470 --> 03:07:49,770
He's such a pretty boy.

3660
03:07:49,850 --> 03:07:50,850
He added him in 7?

3661
03:07:51,490 --> 03:07:53,270
I don't remember him at all.

3662
03:07:54,370 --> 03:07:56,510
He's such a- oh my god!

3663
03:07:57,470 --> 03:07:59,190
I'm looking at his designs!

3664
03:08:00,010 --> 03:08:03,530
And I'm like, what the- guys, look at this design.

3665
03:08:03,690 --> 03:08:06,050
Oh my- this is what he looked like before.

3666
03:08:06,270 --> 03:08:08,170
I don't remember him.

3667
03:08:09,050 --> 03:08:10,670
This is what they did to Zhang.

3668
03:08:10,770 --> 03:08:12,030
They took away Zhang.

3669
03:08:12,150 --> 03:08:12,950
He's fabulous.

3670
03:08:13,110 --> 03:08:15,270
And then just gave it to everybody else.

3671
03:08:15,850 --> 03:08:17,970
Oh my god!

3672
03:08:19,210 --> 03:08:20,590
Look at this outfit!

3673
03:08:20,630 --> 03:08:22,550
What the fuck is this outfit?

3674
03:08:23,190 --> 03:08:32,150
Oh my god, he's so- oh my god, with the thigh- with the thigh boots too?

3675
03:08:32,670 --> 03:08:34,350
Oh my god!

3676
03:08:34,350 --> 03:08:36,190
Wait, look at this outfit.

3677
03:08:36,490 --> 03:08:38,810
Look at those boots, guys!

3678
03:08:39,710 --> 03:08:41,290
Wait, does he play pool?

3679
03:08:41,790 --> 03:08:43,650
Was that his whole thing?

3680
03:08:44,550 --> 03:08:46,330
Oh my god, you're right!

3681
03:08:46,590 --> 03:08:48,910
His outfit is a pool player!

3682
03:08:50,610 --> 03:08:52,310
Looks very historical, guys.

3683
03:08:52,430 --> 03:08:52,950
It does.

3684
03:08:53,090 --> 03:08:53,590
It does.

3685
03:08:54,090 --> 03:08:55,970
I was like, who the fuck is this guy?

3686
03:09:09,690 --> 03:09:12,590
His weapon was pool sticks.

3687
03:09:12,770 --> 03:09:13,790
That's like, hilarious.

3688
03:09:28,380 --> 03:09:29,720
Who's this guy?

3689
03:09:34,940 --> 03:09:36,780
This is so default.

3690
03:09:37,160 --> 03:09:38,380
There's no way he has a name.

3691
03:09:49,920 --> 03:09:50,760
What?

3692
03:09:52,120 --> 03:09:58,020
It's like, die by trainer and die by the battlefield.

3693
03:09:59,360 --> 03:09:59,720
Eugene?

3694
03:10:07,650 --> 03:10:11,690
Apologies for inter- you'll lose your men's favorite.

3695
03:10:12,730 --> 03:10:14,550
I don't care about him too much.

3696
03:10:14,590 --> 03:10:15,690
He looks too default.

3697
03:10:35,730 --> 03:10:37,830
Eugene never asked for this!

3698
03:10:55,290 --> 03:10:57,690
I think that already happened.

3699
03:10:57,810 --> 03:11:00,590
They already outwrote me from several battles.

3700
03:11:04,030 --> 03:11:07,030
Tata literally took credit of killing Chengjiao.

3701
03:11:20,180 --> 03:11:22,740
It's disappearing in real time, guys.

3702
03:11:24,120 --> 03:11:25,200
Did you find some work?

3703
03:11:25,400 --> 03:11:27,320
Did you stop being a fucking moocher?

3704
03:11:29,740 --> 03:11:30,780
Your housewife?

3705
03:11:30,900 --> 03:11:32,100
I mean your doctor.

3706
03:11:32,860 --> 03:11:33,840
Thank god!

3707
03:11:33,920 --> 03:11:35,180
Are you gonna start paying rent?

3708
03:11:42,320 --> 03:11:43,800
My male wife.

3709
03:11:46,980 --> 03:11:47,800
Ugh!

3710
03:11:57,900 --> 03:12:04,360
I always forget he's my little roommate.

3711
03:12:05,760 --> 03:12:07,220
Back to work?

3712
03:12:10,220 --> 03:12:11,460
Oh, I'm the work?

3713
03:12:12,280 --> 03:12:16,060
Okay, I guess you're not gonna be pay- I'm still gonna pay the full rent, I guess.

3714
03:12:24,680 --> 03:12:27,480
I guess I'm still paying the full rent.

3715
03:12:28,880 --> 03:12:29,300
That's fine.

3716
03:12:30,760 --> 03:12:32,560
That's- that's fine.

3717
03:12:34,000 --> 03:12:35,540
My little freeloader.

3718
03:12:36,380 --> 03:12:38,900
That follows me around and does nothing.

3719
03:12:39,640 --> 03:12:41,720
Oh, a new super chat!

3720
03:12:42,640 --> 03:12:43,460
Not Doki.

3721
03:12:43,700 --> 03:12:46,020
Thank you for the super chat, novice Chin Soldier.

3722
03:12:46,800 --> 03:12:50,140
I was one of the people using magic in- oh, I guess that's what they call it.

3723
03:12:52,220 --> 03:12:53,940
Magic in Yang Province.

3724
03:12:54,280 --> 03:13:00,440
I should mention that thanks to Lord Tata, I was able to leave my disgraceful past behind and start a new life.

3725
03:13:00,720 --> 03:13:06,780
I owe a great deal to him, but I will also never forget the one who taught us how to harness the power of incense.

3726
03:13:06,780 --> 03:13:14,080
The way you carry yourself, your aura, that out- that outwardliness about you.

3727
03:13:14,200 --> 03:13:15,720
It so reminds me of him.

3728
03:13:16,160 --> 03:13:17,400
You two know each other, right?

3729
03:13:17,540 --> 03:13:21,260
If you ever encounter him again somewhere, please tell him that we are- Wait, what?

3730
03:13:22,040 --> 03:13:26,580
This guy super chatted me to tell Lord Chao Chao that he's grateful for him?

3731
03:13:27,060 --> 03:13:30,640
I- Okay.

3732
03:13:30,640 --> 03:13:30,800
Okay.

3733
03:13:36,440 --> 03:13:39,440
Wow, it's just like my streaming.

3734
03:13:39,960 --> 03:13:44,060
I guess thanks for the money, I guess.

3735
03:13:44,620 --> 03:13:49,040
He's just like, can you tell Chao Chao that I'm still thinking about him?

3736
03:13:49,320 --> 03:14:01,580
Since you're doing a collab with him right now, here's a- Can you pass the message- He's not reading my super chat, so I'm gonna super chat you so you can tell him about my super chat.

3737
03:14:02,640 --> 03:14:06,700
Yujin, thank you for the- Yujin, I have something I'd like to ask you.

3738
03:14:06,800 --> 03:14:11,960
I apologize for the sudden request, but can you give me a chance to speak with- I guess thanks for the money, though.

3739
03:14:12,280 --> 03:14:14,320
Give me a chance to speak with you in person?

3740
03:14:14,800 --> 03:14:16,600
There's so much I wish to know about you.

3741
03:14:16,900 --> 03:14:21,360
That's taking everything I have to contain my impulse to arrive at your door.

3742
03:14:23,340 --> 03:14:26,040
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

3743
03:14:26,040 --> 03:14:29,940
Hey Toki, can you tell him that I'm grateful for his streams?

3744
03:14:30,280 --> 03:14:31,720
She's back now!

3745
03:14:31,840 --> 03:14:33,280
She's back from Japan!

3746
03:14:34,680 --> 03:14:38,980
Thank you, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

3747
03:14:39,660 --> 03:14:41,940
But thanks for the money, I appreciate it.

3748
03:14:44,380 --> 03:14:49,120
Please come meet me in the city whenever it is convenient- Oh my god, he cannot wait for me.

3749
03:14:50,600 --> 03:14:54,180
Oh, okay, he's like- Oh shit, 30?

3750
03:14:54,500 --> 03:14:55,680
Let's fucking go.

3751
03:14:58,660 --> 03:14:59,220
Nice.

3752
03:15:00,700 --> 03:15:04,800
I have- oh my god, I think I might have to use the Oblivion gem.

3753
03:15:05,120 --> 03:15:06,760
I'm gonna use the attack, then.

3754
03:15:08,540 --> 03:15:16,640
Literally, like, my other gems aren't- My other gems are so underleveled compared to it.

3755
03:15:16,700 --> 03:15:18,820
But I like the damage boost, though.

3756
03:15:19,720 --> 03:15:23,060
Damage boost is so nice, because I parry a lot.

3757
03:15:25,980 --> 03:15:29,100
We'll try the Oblivion gem, since it is higher now.

3758
03:15:29,700 --> 03:15:31,640
Alright, who else wants to talk to me?

3759
03:15:35,660 --> 03:15:41,800
Alright, is it just- okay, I could pay for- Okay, I have Guo Ji- Jia and Yun Zhen.

3760
03:15:41,920 --> 03:15:42,480
Where is he?

3761
03:15:43,180 --> 03:15:48,260
Okay, I'm gonna pay for Dian Wei, because I cannot be bothered.

3762
03:15:48,260 --> 03:15:49,840
Actually, wait, what was it?

3763
03:15:50,180 --> 03:15:52,420
What were the things he wanted me to do, Pantong?

3764
03:15:52,700 --> 03:15:53,680
I don't remember.

3765
03:15:55,560 --> 03:15:57,860
There was, like, one that I was like, I hate it.

3766
03:16:01,800 --> 03:16:02,520
It was...

3767
03:16:03,260 --> 03:16:04,480
Oh yeah, it was this.

3768
03:16:04,560 --> 03:16:05,560
Yeah, I'm paying for that.

3769
03:16:05,660 --> 03:16:06,700
I'll pay for that later.

3770
03:16:09,020 --> 03:16:10,480
I don't wanna pay for it now.

3771
03:16:10,760 --> 03:16:12,180
Okay, is this the Yang province?

3772
03:16:13,560 --> 03:16:14,280
That's Jin.

3773
03:16:16,020 --> 03:16:16,740
Where's Yang?

3774
03:16:18,260 --> 03:16:18,880
That's Lian.

3775
03:16:19,280 --> 03:16:19,940
That's Ji.

3776
03:16:20,420 --> 03:16:21,540
That's You province.

3777
03:16:22,920 --> 03:16:24,000
That's Jin again.

3778
03:16:24,360 --> 03:16:25,880
The fuck is Yang?

3779
03:16:26,900 --> 03:16:27,440
Yu.

3780
03:16:27,900 --> 03:16:28,740
Shu.

3781
03:16:29,760 --> 03:16:30,600
Ji.

3782
03:16:31,300 --> 03:16:31,660
Qing.

3783
03:16:32,620 --> 03:16:35,580
Oh, no that- Where is it?

3784
03:16:37,060 --> 03:16:39,340
Okay, let me find it here.

3785
03:16:43,480 --> 03:16:44,180
Hu Ya?

3786
03:16:44,660 --> 03:16:45,540
It's in the middle?

3787
03:16:46,500 --> 03:16:47,000
Qing.

3788
03:16:47,600 --> 03:16:48,240
Yu.

3789
03:16:48,840 --> 03:16:49,420
Si Li.

3790
03:16:49,420 --> 03:16:50,780
Oh, there it is.

3791
03:16:50,820 --> 03:16:51,460
There's Yang.

3792
03:16:51,880 --> 03:16:53,140
Okay, I found it.

3793
03:16:55,180 --> 03:16:56,180
There he is.

3794
03:16:56,780 --> 03:16:57,880
Hey, I did your mission.

3795
03:17:03,480 --> 03:17:05,800
Are we going on another food date again?

3796
03:17:06,040 --> 03:17:08,400
I feel like all they do is just take me out for lunch.

3797
03:17:18,370 --> 03:17:19,650
What do you mean?

3798
03:17:20,390 --> 03:17:23,850
I was a little suspi- I was a little suspicious.

3799
03:17:35,290 --> 03:17:35,930
Yeah.

3800
03:17:36,590 --> 03:17:38,130
Felt like...

3801
03:17:38,130 --> 03:17:41,650
I mean, you really want to appear out of nowhere at my doorstep.

3802
03:17:46,390 --> 03:17:47,670
This could've been a text!

3803
03:17:49,410 --> 03:17:53,370
Yujin, this could- This could've been a text!

3804
03:17:55,310 --> 03:17:56,910
I could've wrote a letter!

3805
03:18:08,210 --> 03:18:10,130
You could've wrote me a letter!

3806
03:18:27,310 --> 03:18:29,490
Oh my god, I still exist here?

3807
03:18:29,570 --> 03:18:31,050
They haven't rooted me out yet?

3808
03:18:37,250 --> 03:18:38,230
Look, Yujin.

3809
03:18:38,530 --> 03:18:39,410
You're not Lu Bu.

3810
03:18:40,350 --> 03:18:40,950
I'm sorry.

3811
03:18:41,570 --> 03:18:43,050
This could've been an email.

3812
03:18:49,230 --> 03:18:52,010
And I wondered if you might have some connection to me.

3813
03:18:52,010 --> 03:18:52,010
Oh!

3814
03:18:52,170 --> 03:18:53,010
Wait, my past!

3815
03:18:53,190 --> 03:18:54,290
He has a connection about my past.

3816
03:18:54,350 --> 03:18:55,790
Anyway, I'm trying to learn everything about you.

3817
03:18:56,630 --> 03:18:57,790
I hope that's no bother.

3818
03:19:00,750 --> 03:19:05,050
Calm do- Calm down, little boy.

3819
03:19:07,490 --> 03:19:10,010
I don't remember my- I wanna say this.

3820
03:19:10,090 --> 03:19:10,830
I wanna say it.

3821
03:19:11,670 --> 03:19:13,530
I was just so excited to meet you.

3822
03:19:14,550 --> 03:19:15,370
Of course.

3823
03:19:16,030 --> 03:19:16,730
Your memories.

3824
03:19:17,670 --> 03:19:19,230
Oh, he backed off.

3825
03:19:19,370 --> 03:19:22,190
He was like, oh no, he might not be interested.

3826
03:19:25,310 --> 03:19:26,930
He backed off.

3827
03:19:27,070 --> 03:19:29,110
He was like, wait, is he not interested?

3828
03:19:34,390 --> 03:19:35,950
Slow down, buddy.

3829
03:19:36,110 --> 03:19:37,170
Slow down.

3830
03:19:37,630 --> 03:19:39,710
I have lots of choices.

3831
03:19:42,910 --> 03:19:43,990
Alright, nice.

3832
03:19:46,610 --> 03:19:47,630
What's this?

3833
03:19:47,870 --> 03:19:50,090
Okay, it's just a weapon shop, but I'm still broke.

3834
03:19:53,750 --> 03:19:57,130
You're giving him self-doubt, Toki!

3835
03:19:59,350 --> 03:20:01,150
Aw, they changed his shoes!

3836
03:20:01,670 --> 03:20:03,310
No more thigh shoes!

3837
03:20:17,430 --> 03:20:20,710
Already missed his thigh shoes.

3838
03:20:28,810 --> 03:20:31,070
Sounds so young!

3839
03:20:31,070 --> 03:20:31,730
What's happening?

3840
03:20:39,010 --> 03:20:46,070
They took away Zhang Yi's flamboyantness and then distributed it across the Wu faction.

3841
03:20:47,210 --> 03:20:48,330
A favorite of yours.

3842
03:20:49,930 --> 03:20:51,610
Wait, is he gonna show Pu?

3843
03:20:53,190 --> 03:20:55,090
Is he gonna play Pu?

3844
03:21:15,190 --> 03:21:19,470
Sorry, I meant Wei.

3845
03:21:19,790 --> 03:21:24,530
I always mix up Wei and Wu because... wait, what?

3846
03:21:26,250 --> 03:21:27,310
Wait, what?

3847
03:21:28,990 --> 03:21:33,310
But I always mix Wei and Wu because they both started with W and I always mix up the two.

3848
03:21:34,770 --> 03:21:38,110
I feel a bit... whoa, wait, what?

3849
03:21:38,430 --> 03:21:40,330
Sorry, I just processed what he said.

3850
03:21:40,810 --> 03:21:46,650
I feel a bit... what do I say?

3851
03:21:47,130 --> 03:21:48,470
Glad to have your expertise?

3852
03:21:48,850 --> 03:21:49,110
Okay.

3853
03:22:02,750 --> 03:22:03,250
Whoa!

3854
03:22:05,190 --> 03:22:05,910
Wait, what?

3855
03:22:06,590 --> 03:22:07,090
What?

3856
03:22:07,270 --> 03:22:07,570
Wait!

3857
03:22:10,190 --> 03:22:15,990
What do you... wait, why don't you want people here to watch?

3858
03:22:16,490 --> 03:22:16,770
Whoa!

3859
03:22:18,110 --> 03:22:18,610
Okay!

3860
03:22:20,070 --> 03:22:21,110
What is this dude?

3861
03:22:21,230 --> 03:22:22,470
No, you don't fade to black!

3862
03:22:22,590 --> 03:22:23,930
Show me what this dude...

3863
03:22:23,930 --> 03:22:26,310
No, you do not fade to black!

3864
03:22:26,490 --> 03:22:28,630
What is this dude doing?

3865
03:22:29,190 --> 03:22:29,890
Wait, what?

3866
03:22:30,250 --> 03:22:31,650
I never wait!

3867
03:22:32,130 --> 03:22:34,290
What do you mean fade to black?

3868
03:22:34,850 --> 03:22:37,630
Wait, what do we do?

3869
03:22:38,090 --> 03:22:40,490
What is this new experience?

3870
03:22:41,390 --> 03:22:42,910
What do we do?

3871
03:22:43,370 --> 03:22:45,150
What do you mean fade to black?

3872
03:22:46,970 --> 03:22:48,450
What do you think?

3873
03:22:48,650 --> 03:22:52,170
Are you able to see things differently now?

3874
03:22:52,890 --> 03:23:01,250
Our lives pass in a fleeting moment, so we must take time to seek out whatever brings us joy.

3875
03:23:01,690 --> 03:23:04,730
You're beginning to understand yourself.

3876
03:23:06,090 --> 03:23:07,970
What do we do?

3877
03:23:08,890 --> 03:23:10,670
What did we do?

3878
03:23:14,350 --> 03:23:16,490
Like, it just fades!

3879
03:23:16,790 --> 03:23:18,130
What did we do?

3880
03:23:18,770 --> 03:23:19,950
Oh my god!

3881
03:23:20,370 --> 03:23:25,950
Okay, alright, I guess we fade to black.

3882
03:23:26,270 --> 03:23:30,790
I don't know what happened, but I guess that's the deal.

3883
03:23:31,110 --> 03:23:38,330
He said he'll give me a new experience, and then like, he's like, let's go somewhere where there's not a lot of people.

3884
03:23:38,330 --> 03:23:41,370
I was like, okay, and then it stops!

3885
03:23:47,170 --> 03:23:50,070
That's a good stopping point, guys.

3886
03:23:50,470 --> 03:23:55,350
They play Monopoly all night long.

3887
03:23:55,790 --> 03:23:57,750
It's just Monopoly, right?

3888
03:23:58,210 --> 03:24:00,810
Warrior, peace, and speaker spread out.

3889
03:24:02,130 --> 03:24:06,250
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

3890
03:24:08,650 --> 03:24:11,630
Mantra, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

3891
03:24:11,830 --> 03:24:17,490
I mean, there was a battle in about 260 BC, China, that had about 700,000 casualties.

3892
03:24:18,450 --> 03:24:20,410
The battle changed, and it was all me.

3893
03:24:20,790 --> 03:24:22,710
The battle changed, being 450k.

3894
03:24:23,110 --> 03:24:28,110
Your KD is alright, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

3895
03:24:28,790 --> 03:24:32,870
CFMG, he don't cook, he don't clean, so let him show you how he got better.

3896
03:24:35,310 --> 03:24:40,370
Doctor, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

3897
03:24:41,050 --> 03:24:43,570
Guto, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

3898
03:24:44,050 --> 03:24:47,370
Justice for Chao Chao, he just wanted to make a world that followed the law.

3899
03:24:47,670 --> 03:24:54,030
Better than Lupe, who has no plans, let his allies do everything, and could not even protect his son from falling.

3900
03:24:54,390 --> 03:24:55,890
I mean, that's true, though.

3901
03:24:56,030 --> 03:25:03,410
Lupe literally had everything to win, but he was just so bad at being a leader.

3902
03:25:03,410 --> 03:25:06,230
But yes, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

3903
03:25:06,510 --> 03:25:09,350
Hey guys, that's a good stopping point, everybody.

3904
03:25:10,430 --> 03:25:16,710
I wish I could do a livestream for it, but like, I've just been slowly, gradually getting my voice back in order.

3905
03:25:16,850 --> 03:25:19,270
I mean, every day is an improvement, so that's good.

3906
03:25:19,710 --> 03:25:24,490
Every day, my voice is getting better and better, so like, I'm glad for that.

3907
03:25:24,570 --> 03:25:26,050
It just takes a bit to warm up.

3908
03:25:27,490 --> 03:25:28,890
But thank you all for coming!

3909
03:25:29,230 --> 03:25:30,490
I always appreciate it, guys.

3910
03:25:30,550 --> 03:25:34,090
I hope you guys had a great time on another Dynasty Warriors part.

3911
03:25:35,490 --> 03:25:36,670
Part 5 or 6?

3912
03:25:36,770 --> 03:25:39,630
I mean, this is going to be a long series, because we're going to do all the factions.

3913
03:25:39,810 --> 03:25:41,330
We're going to do Shu, Wei, Wu, and Wu.

3914
03:25:41,970 --> 03:25:43,150
So we're going to do all of them.

3915
03:25:43,470 --> 03:25:48,010
So it's definitely going to take us a while to finish this, but it's going to be worth it, because this is my favorite series.

3916
03:25:48,670 --> 03:25:50,830
This is my favorite game of all time.

3917
03:25:51,030 --> 03:25:54,750
Like, not just Origins, but Dynasty Warriors in general is just my favorite series.

3918
03:25:54,750 --> 03:25:55,790
Anyway, guys.

3919
03:25:56,570 --> 03:25:57,230
Also, Deadpool.

3920
03:25:57,410 --> 03:25:58,130
Thank you for the super chat.

3921
03:25:58,210 --> 03:25:58,990
Thank you, thank you.

3922
03:25:59,050 --> 03:26:04,790
There's a doujin of 2K Dan and Ciba Tao that shows what they did.

3923
03:26:05,070 --> 03:26:06,790
Thank you for the super chat.

3924
03:26:06,890 --> 03:26:07,870
Thank you, thank you.

3925
03:26:08,030 --> 03:26:08,650
Alright, guys.

3926
03:26:08,870 --> 03:26:09,950
As always, everybody.

3927
03:26:10,050 --> 03:26:10,250
Oh, yeah.

3928
03:26:10,290 --> 03:26:12,730
Before we go, please check out.

3929
03:26:12,770 --> 03:26:17,010
We do have official plushies out right now from YouTubes.

3930
03:26:17,330 --> 03:26:20,150
I actually... so please check it out.

3931
03:26:20,230 --> 03:26:22,850
I'm going to show a little bit, guys, before I go.

3932
03:26:22,850 --> 03:26:25,490
But yes, wish to support me.

3933
03:26:25,650 --> 03:26:27,810
Please check out these official plushies.

3934
03:26:27,970 --> 03:26:29,870
They actually sent me the plushies.

3935
03:26:30,050 --> 03:26:31,850
And they're actually really big.

3936
03:26:31,930 --> 03:26:35,230
I was very surprised how big they were in general.

3937
03:26:35,750 --> 03:26:38,830
And the quality is insane.

3938
03:26:38,970 --> 03:26:40,690
I might post a picture of it in the future.

3939
03:26:41,150 --> 03:26:42,810
I'll post a picture of it on Twitter.

3940
03:26:43,250 --> 03:26:45,010
And also show it on stream later.

3941
03:26:45,390 --> 03:26:46,530
And take a couple of pictures.

3942
03:26:46,710 --> 03:26:49,410
I think my favorite has to be the tomato.

3943
03:26:49,410 --> 03:26:52,410
I love chucking the tomato.

3944
03:26:52,930 --> 03:26:53,970
I don't know.

3945
03:26:54,250 --> 03:26:56,290
It's very chuckable.

3946
03:26:56,510 --> 03:26:57,390
Let me just say.

3947
03:26:59,450 --> 03:27:00,250
Thank you for the super chat.

3948
03:27:00,430 --> 03:27:01,210
Thank you, thank you.

3949
03:27:01,570 --> 03:27:04,570
That's way too common here to be a new experience.

3950
03:27:04,910 --> 03:27:06,490
That makes me see the world differently.

3951
03:27:06,910 --> 03:27:08,490
Oh, my God.

3952
03:27:08,850 --> 03:27:10,790
Thank you for the super chat.

3953
03:27:10,990 --> 03:27:12,210
Thank you, thank you.

3954
03:27:12,510 --> 03:27:13,190
Alright, guys.

3955
03:27:13,510 --> 03:27:15,090
As always, stay hydrated.

3956
03:27:15,390 --> 03:27:16,070
Posture check.

3957
03:27:16,070 --> 03:27:18,270
Also, I'll just say.

3958
03:27:19,010 --> 03:27:22,330
The more sales we get on these plushies.

3959
03:27:22,770 --> 03:27:25,850
The more opportunities we have in the future.

3960
03:27:26,010 --> 03:27:27,770
So it really does mean a lot.

3961
03:27:28,150 --> 03:27:29,010
If we can get more.

3962
03:27:29,230 --> 03:27:31,570
The more support we can get for these plushies.

3963
03:27:32,370 --> 03:27:33,270
Hey, guys.

3964
03:27:33,470 --> 03:27:34,310
I'll just say that.

3965
03:27:34,410 --> 03:27:34,990
That's all I'll say.

3966
03:27:35,790 --> 03:27:37,370
I'll see you guys later, everybody.

3967
03:27:37,530 --> 03:27:39,230
I'll say it again.

3968
03:27:39,330 --> 03:27:40,410
Stay hydrated.

3969
03:27:40,670 --> 03:27:41,150
Posture check.

3970
03:27:41,330 --> 03:27:42,730
Get that blood flowing.

3971
03:27:42,730 --> 03:27:44,090
And if you stayed up for me.

3972
03:27:44,190 --> 03:27:45,090
Head to bed.

3973
03:27:45,210 --> 03:27:46,630
Cause you deserve it.

3974
03:27:46,870 --> 03:27:48,570
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

3975
03:27:49,210 --> 03:27:50,130
Bye, guys.

3976
03:27:50,290 --> 03:27:50,750
Bye.
