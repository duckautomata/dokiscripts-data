1
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,740
Fake loop!

2
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,320
Fake loop!

3
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,360
That's right!

4
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,300
Get baited, everyone!

5
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,940
No loop here!

6
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,100
No loop here.

7
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,460
Anyway, give it up for day three!

8
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,780
Day three of Sleepy Bird!

9
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:23,540
I am... I am still... I am still... Eepy, unfortunately.

10
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,220
I'm... This is honestly how I've been feeling right now.

11
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,420
the last couple of days.

12
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,020
I think it doesn't help that I'm still coughing.

13
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:36,420
I think I'm not even like sick coughing anymore.

14
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,980
It's just my throat is just so scratchy.

15
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,260
I think it's just from, it must be from streaming, but then
I have to stream to make money.

16
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,120
So it's a negative loop right now, but it's okay.

17
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,260
Oh my gosh, I forgot.

18
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,020
Monday is our, is our last day for the project.

19
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:49,760
Zon boys wherever.

20
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,520
And then it's okay.

21
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,440
And then Tuesday.

22
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,120
Oh, oh yeah.

23
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,820
My sponsor on Tuesday got canceled.

24
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,060
So Tuesday is a free day for you.

25
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:55,320
Okay.

26
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,960
Tuesday will be my free day.

27
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,000
And so is Sunday.

28
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,240
Um, hey, the fix.

29
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,980
Welcome to tomato farm.

30
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:03,400
Welcome.

31
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:04,100
Welcome.

32
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,440
It's the sixth streamer paradox.

33
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,660
The thing is, after I finish streaming, I stop coughing.

34
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,480
Because like, I'm not talking.

35
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,300
So my throat isn't getting like itchy.

36
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:19,160
For those who don't know, like, um, the reason why you cough
is because your vocal cords are getting irritated.

37
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,120
So my throat is getting irritated.

38
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:21,980
So it's scratchy.

39
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,980
And that's why I cough.

40
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,060
Um, but like, I'm getting less and less cough.

41
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,000
So that's okay.

42
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:39,040
But, um, I'm still really eepy today, so that's why I'm
sleepy bird is back yet again But some very important

43
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,400

52
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,580
I am the target audience.

53
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,720
And also, Adventure Time Season part one.

54
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,960
Finn and Jake are back on the story.

55
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,740
Oh, guys, I need a...

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,620

59
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,500
Oh, guys, I'm sorry.

61
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,620

62
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,960
Give me a sec, guys.

63
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:50,880
I'm sorry.

64
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,540
Give me a sec.

65
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,280
Let me...

66
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,340
Well, I forgot.

67
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,760
I need to do this before...

68
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,440
Before I forget again.

69
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,880
Give me a sec.

70
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,580
Guys, I'm sorry.

71
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,120
Guys, I know what I am.

72
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:09,640
I'm sorry.

73
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,800
You can't fix me.

74
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,680
I know what I am.

75
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,760
I'm sorry, everyone.

76
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,040
This is who I am.

77
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,240
They got me.

78
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,580
They say oink, oink, dokey, new collab skin.

79
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,740
And I'm like, oink.

80
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:27,730
Jump little sheep.

81
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,630
It's really bad.

82
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:34,930
You can tell the point when they started announcing every
collab skin that I've always dreamed of.

83
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:38,390
I can't help it.

84
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,130
This is why.

85
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:40,770
Guys, guys, look.

86
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,510
Here's the positive thing, though.

87
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,910
At least I'm not into gambling.

88
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,410
Or CS skins, guys.

89
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:48,170
At least.

90
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,150
At least.

91
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:49,810
At least.

92
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,490
If it's any skin.

93
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:54,730
It's not CS skins, guys.

94
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,870
That's the bright side of things.

95
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:06,090
you know you know it's all about what's the word it's all
about the bright south there's a there's a phrase for it

00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,320
Oh, my God.

00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,360
Okay, give me a sec.

Let me get...

00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,300
I don't have a problem, guys.

133
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,900
I can stop anytime I want.

134
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,920
I just choose to not stop now.

135
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,980
This is a choice, guys.

136
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,640
This is a choice.

137
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:26,880
I swear I can stop anytime I want.

138
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,180
But I choose.

139
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,980
to do this to myself.

140
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:34,620
Sure.

141
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,040
Wait, do I not get the Bimo back?

142
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,640
Are you fucking kidding me?

143
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,900
Okay, that's fine.

144
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,200
That's fine.

145
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,440
I want to be Finn now.

146
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:45,940
All right, claim all.

147
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,960
Don't believe her lies.

148
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,240
Are you kidding me?

149
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,800
I want a Bimo.

150
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,220
Oh my god.

151
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,340
Wait, the dance.

152
00:11:59,360 --> 00:11:59,800
Fuck.

153
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,820
Oh, fuck.

154
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,200
Okay.

155
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,360
Fuck, do I...

156
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,000
Oh, fuck.

157
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,420
Okay, do I...

158
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:12,900
I wish I could choose my Yoshi, and this is embarrassing.

159
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,600
What do you mean?

160
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,640
Wait, what's this?

161
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,380
Mona Lisa?

162
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,860
I swear, I do not know these new dances.

163
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,100
Are there any good dances, though?

164
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:24,900
Let's see.

165
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,260
I have no idea what any of these songs are.

166
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,980
Oh, shit.

167
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,380
The shake and split.

168
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,680
I feel like I've seen that before, but I don't know from
where.

169
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,160
Uh-huh.

170
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,300
Alright.

171
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,400
Oh, he's doing it.

172
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:43,960
Go, Jake.

173
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:44,600
Go, fit.

174
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,160

God of War is having his feelings hurt again.

294
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,120
He's so cursed.

295
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,160
Oh yeah, for those who don't know, the reason for those who
are like, where's my Chibi Doki collab?

296
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,420
She is very sick right now.

297
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:36,460
because her throat just like me uh but not like me but uh
because uh she strained her throat a lot so the doctor

298
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:45,120
advised her that she needs to rest up uh so because of that
we're playing god of war yippee god of war time where's my

299
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:59,060

302
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:25,660

303
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,940
Where's my Marvel rivals, Doki?

304
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,920

305

Anyway.

306
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,260
Anyway, yippee, got a water.

307
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:40,500
Yeah.

308
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,100
See, we eventually got to there.

309
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,540
Look, it was a...

310
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,220
We had to...

311
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,840
I was like a life update, okay?

312
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,280
I lost stuff I needed to check out, guys.

313
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:52,860
Oh, yeah.

314
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:53,400
Wait, I forgot.

315
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:57,100
Speaking of rivals, speaking of fucking rivals, I...

316
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:57,780
You know what?

317
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:03,960
Okay, I will have to say after, um, okay, no, you guys do
not understand.

318
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:09,140
So I did not realize what the fuck was going on on Tyler 1's
screen.

319
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,460
But, um, oh my gosh.

320
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:16,880
No, I, it is an accomplishment that we even got third place
in the end.

321
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:27,940
Because this is what was happening on Tyler's screen while,
like, Moxie and I.

322
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,200
We're playing our fucking hearts out.

323
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:41,720
So, we're just, this was what's going on on his screen.

324
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:42,680
Well, yeah.

325
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:56,100
So, the fact that, the fact that we even made it that far to
third was like, I'm proud of ourself like i'm really proud

326
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,500
of us we're even making it this far

327
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:19,860
yeah like like we we were we did it guys we fucking did it i
didn't realize how much of a deep bro he's a dad he has no

328
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:30,180
time for this guys he's a fucking dad it was a fucking
miracle we like beat super and got third place and even got

329
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:40,080
as close as we got against XQC's team because their their
weakest player is level 66 guys they're like beginner player

330
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:51,840
is level 66 apparently from what Moxie told me and then I
was like what we had three players that weren't even level

331
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,040
10 we

332
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:01,700
We had three players that weren't even level 10.

333
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:08,500
So I was just like, oh my God, that's crazy that we've made
it so far.

334
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,820
That's actually crazy.

335
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,780
Like we've made it so far.

336
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,820
I'm proud of us.

337
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,540
I'm so proud of us right now.

338
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,760
Especially after I saw Tyler's team.

339
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,740
After I saw Tyler's club.

340
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,340
But for the fucking plate, Mordel.

341
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:32,440
Yeah.

342
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,720
Um, yeah, so it was insane.

343
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,280
I saw this clip today.

344
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:42,220
And I was like, oh my God, that's what Moxie and that's what
Moxie was talking about.

345
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,380
I did not realize it was that bad.

346
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:51,060
I, wow, with this, you got, yeah, we got third.

347
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,920
Is that insane?

348
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,900
We, I'm so proud of us.

349
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:07,800
like I'm not I was I was proud of us even before I like
before I saw this and now I'm like wow we we really pulled

350
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:15,600
off a miracle right there we did a um we did a miracle run
for during the

351
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:26,610
tournament but why can't bro that tournament was 200k first
place literally each player gets 20k

352
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:36,750
If you get the first place, first place, each player gets
$20,000 for winning first.

353
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:40,210
It's literally for money.

354
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:45,150
Yeah, it's damn crazy.

355
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:48,190
That's why everyone was, like, trying so hard.

356
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:49,950
That's where we'll find Grow a Shrine.

357
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:54,530
Yeah, we're an elf then.

358
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,900
I see the elves continue their war.

359
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,940
Yeah, so the war's still going on.

360
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:04,560
What happened?

361
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:10,220
I thought I brought peace to the world I don't know if I'm
playing J3's tournament.

362
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:13,940
I just posted an LFT I just do it for fun.

363
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:14,740
I don't do it for money

364
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,580
I just really enjoy tournaments in general

365
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:34,490
Fimble winter hit Alphine hard no Storms have plagued
Alphine's deserts long before Fimble winter all right let's

366
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:42,910

people through tournaments living desert huh i don't know i

367
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:46,450
i just made an ltc like if any of the pro players want me

368
00:27:53,710 --> 00:28:01,570

just like so if i do get offers i will

369
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:18,490

will lose but like because I'm in it but but you know you

370
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:28,690
know what I mean hold on I hear something out there
something big it's in pain oh what do you hear with your

371
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:37,650
special ears don't think it feels like some kind of animal
How could anything live in a storm like that?

372
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:39,090
Ah, oh, wait, oh.

373
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:44,550
Not exactly a paragon of comfort, but the Dark Elves get all
the rest they can't.

374
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:46,690
Fire time.

375
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:50,070
Where is the other fire?

376
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:52,930
Wait, why is it just one?

377
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:55,430
Where's the other one?

378
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:59,230
No, I'm just cursed.

379
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:09,010
We finally broke our content creator slash content creators
slash non-VTuber rivals tournament run.

380
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:17,450
I literally had such a bad percentage win rate for that
tournament, for those types of tournaments, and we finally

381
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:18,570
broke the curse.

382
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:21,830
And it was with Tyler 1.

383
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:25,390
I'm glad it was with Tyler 1 for it.

384
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:28,050
I had so much fun.

385
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:30,290
I hope I get to play with any of these people again.

386
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:31,770
Everyone was so...

387
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,510
Everyone was really fun in the end.

388
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:44,450

At least I can go down from here.

395
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,480
Women demon.

396
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,880
You don't respect your demon!

397
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,040
Like I don't respect women.

398
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,760
Guys, how much more aggressive can I be?

399
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,780
With bad hell yeah!

400
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,120
Sorry, I guess I wasn't aggressive enough with that.

401
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,120
Never let him forget.

402
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:21,740
You're right.

403
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,280
Bad Hella or I throw.

404
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:25,980
You're so right.

405
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,040
I should have been like, bad Hella or I throw.

406
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,040
GG's, we lose.

407
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:33,840
Wait.

408
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,440
Freya's brother?

409
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,300
Yes.

410
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,580
Cut from a different cloth.

411
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,160
Wait, who's Freya's brother?

412
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,100
Wait, Tear's Freya's brother?

413
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,020
Jiji go next.

414
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,460
I'm going Widowmaker.

415
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,240
Wait, wait, is Tear Freya's?

416
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,580
Oh, oh, Freya.

417
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,760
Okay, Freya and Freya.

418
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,220
Oh, Freya.

419
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:05,380
I was going to be like, there's no way my wife is a...

420
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:08,540
My wife is the sister of this fucking pussy.

421
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,120
There's no way.

422
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,780
My wife would never.

423
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,640
There's a barricade up ahead.

424
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,560
My wife would never allow this happen.

425
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,920
A rare material that can take millennia to form.

426
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,200
Majestic, isn't it?

427
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,700
Occasionally, the light of Alpine will bind to a rock and
crystallize.

428
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,920
Growing like moss on a fallen tree.

429
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,500
Truly a wonder of the nine rounds.

430
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,520
Change this color when lined up with a target.

431
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:38,920
What does that mean?

432
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,020
Reflect indicator will change.

433
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:45,580
Oh, oh!

434
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,320
What the fuck?

435
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,920
Where do I want it to reflect?

436
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,200
Oh, this is where...

437
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:53,520
Oh!

438
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,600
Hey, yo, bats.

439
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,020
I didn't know it could do that.

440
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,100
Oh, I guess that didn't matter.

441
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,320
Oh, I have to cut this.

442
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,320
Aha.

443
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,140
Whoops.

444
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,080
I just saw bats.

445
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:08,760
Oh.

446
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,140
I don't want it to reflect to.

447
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:22,210
But violence is fun.

448
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:28,130
I don't want... do I want to reflect to this rope thing?

449
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,850
Oh, there's more here.

450
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:34,510
There we go.

451
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:36,510
Very clever.

452
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,310
Clever golf.

453
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:40,730
Straight.

454
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:41,610
Fuck.

455
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:42,710
Oh my god.

456
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:43,670
Oh my god.

457
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:48,990
God damn lizards, my goddamn invasive species.

458
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,150
What is he doing?

459
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,030
He's gonna explode?

460
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:54,930
Oh, it is.

461
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:02,070
Cool spy, welcome to Tomato Farm.

462
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:03,030
Welcome, welcome.

463
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:05,010

464
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:06,930
Oh, gosh, I keep saying super chat.

00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,630
Thank you for the five gifted ships.

466
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:08,990
Thank you.

467
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:09,650
Thank you.

468
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:11,030
I really appreciate it.

469
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:11,670
Oh, yes, brother.

470
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:13,650
How was he involved?

471
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:23,810
long ago flair of the vanier traveled to alfheim where he
discovered a once beautiful land devastated by war using his

472
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:36,030
divine powers he set about cultivating a tenuous peace among
the elves oh peace is not an option to them I remember that

473
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:46,110
did you have to let this guy come with me he's like just
dead weight you hear that oh no oh shit oh shit they're

474
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:53,370

that's right

475
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:06,470
oh my god and of course the pussy fucking runs away yet
again that's all he's good for and he ran away water water

476
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:12,470
yeah here there's no god of peace here i'm God of war.

477
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,320
Whoa!

478
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,280
I think you're hanging out with the dwarves too much, but
boy.

479
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,620
I mean, same, but like.

480
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:28,900
Whoa.

481
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,680
Next, he's going to start calling them knife here.

482
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,320
More will follow once we're inside.

483
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,380
Is there truly no other way?

484
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,280
Not like they're giving us much of a choice.

485
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,060
Yeah.

486
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,100
Don't even need to teach my boy.

487
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,340
Don't say out loud, boy.

488
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,680
You say it in here.

489
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,220
In your heart.

490
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:02,530
Oh, nice.

491
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:05,170
Best we move on for now, brother.

492
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:05,850
Are you serious?

493
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:07,670
Don't think we have the right tools for this one.

494
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:09,790
God damn it, we never have the right tools.

495
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:11,890
Oh, we got the...

496
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:12,490
What is that?

497
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:13,890
Oh, it's just a tribute.

498
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:15,550

00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:30,130

00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:45,800

we came in from the top last time didn't realize all this

502
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:54,120
was even down here it's an older gate built to promote
cooperation Oh, well, it looks like it didn't really work.

503
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:54,960
How do we enter?

504
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,060
Grab that wheel and I'll show you.

505
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,260
We just push it together?

506
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,800
What teamwork?

507
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,100
Yeah.

508
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,440
I'll go first.

509
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,460
Betrayus, let me know when I've reached halfway.

510
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:13,300
So, uh, what's happening right now?

511
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:17,560
This seal is meant to represent the balance of the realm
when Freyr was here.

512
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,360
Light and dark, working together in harmony.

513
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:20,680
Oh.

514
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,820
How's that look, Atreus?

515
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,480
Good, I think.

516
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,180
Father, I...

517
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:31,280
Unfortunately for Alfheim, Freya couldn't accept his
sister's decision to marry Odin.

518
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,600
He returned to Vanaheim and left this realm to its fate.

519
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:40,100
To be fair, the Aesir did set him on fire that one time.

520
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:43,680
Oh.

521
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,380
The door should have opened.

522
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,320
Are you sure it's balanced?

523
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,320
Yeah, but the realm isn't.

524
00:37:50,380 --> 00:38:02,180
not anymore father try pulling it the other way yeah yeah
and here you keep pushing forward oh

525
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:21,090
is it just fully light now because it's not balanced no more
oh yeah cuz we like fucked over the dark elves it's no

526
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,130
longer balanced shall we

527
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:27,630
Yeah, all right.

528
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:29,970
No more dark elves.

529
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,020
What's that?

530
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,100
What's a dark elf statue?

531
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,060
Is that good?

532
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,440
That's just how they looked before the division.

533
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:41,480
The division.

534
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,660
We like, what's that word called?

535
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,360
The elves weren't always split between light and dark.

536
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,500
When you're like...

537
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,980
This statue depicts the elves before the war.

538
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,660
Before they discovered the power of the light.

539
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:52,600
Oh.

540
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,840
We like, are we the baddies?

541
00:38:56,080 --> 00:39:03,980
Like, We did exterminate one type of elves, so I- Oh, let's
not think too hard about that.

542
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:08,640
Oh, we're not- Oh, let's not think too hard about that,
guys.

543
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:09,680
Solid light.

544
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,880
Guess something don't change.

545
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,460
Now we get inside.

546
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,640
Above the door, there's a light crystal.

547
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,600
Oh, it'll break it.

548
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:25,420
Weird.

549
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,780
They usually work.

550
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,080
Do you break it?

551
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:33,960
What?

552
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,640
Oh, we have to reflect it!

553
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:38,440
Oh, my God, I keep forgetting the reflection thing.

554
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,520
Yes, I see now.

555
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:42,120
The Twilight Stone briefly imparts...

556
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,340
No, we just...

557
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:46,800
You know, like, when we go over there, we, like, re-deck...

558
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,940
We, like...

559
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,000
What's the word called?

560
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,340
We rebuild a place?

561
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:58,540
And then, like, then, and then there's, like, expensive
coffee shops and then a place where it usually was, like, a

562
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,280
poor neighborhood.

563
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,220
We just did that.

564
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,940
That's not as bad.

565
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,120
We gentrified it, guys.

566
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,100
Guys, it's okay.

567
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,620
It's just gentrification.

568
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,180
Oh, shit.

569
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:12,720
Ah!

570
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,540
I've never seen the lake of soul so volatile.

571
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,440
My eyes.

572
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:20,580
Guys, it's okay.

573
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,580
We gentrified.

574
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:22,780
Making the light unstable.

575
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,440
So the base of this light well, that's the lake of souls.

576
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:27,460
Yes.

577
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,580
After the creation of the nine rounds, Wait, we can grab one
of the souls in here.

578
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,820
You won't be blue no more.

579
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,900
Wow, coffee is now 20 bucks.

580
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,580
And thus, the light elves were born.

581
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,700
Yeah, it's not great, but it's...

582
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:52,500
I don't like that.

583
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:59,840
As a gamer that lives in a dark in a room with no windows, I
don't like that.

584
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:00,580
that.

585
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,120
That's the light!

586
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:17,960
Like a fucking vampire.

587
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:21,500
It burns.

588
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:26,040
Though I imagine our light elf friends will be less than
pleased.

589
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,980
It's alright, they can just rebuild it.

590
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,620
Oh, it's alright, they won't do anything.

591
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,620
They know what I did to the other elves.

592
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,860
They don't want to mess with me.

593
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:43,960
Speaking of light elves, let me try talking to them again.

594
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:44,340
Alright.

595
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,240
It's just a light these two do their thing, brother.

596
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:50,060
Hey, bro, I don't... I don't think they're here to talk,
guys.

597
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,040
How could they do this to me?

598
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,540
I literally fucking helped them!

599
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,280
Get here!

600
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,700
Oh shit, it's alright, whatever.

601
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,740
I just feel like punching, I guess.

602
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,720
Oh shit!

603
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,140
That's fucking right.

604
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:07,580
Get punched, nerds!

605
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,340
Oh, there's more?

606
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,100
I know, I'm like, how could they like...

607
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:14,940
Okay, I'm this.

608
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,380
I'll get it.

609
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:22,560
I literally did so much for them.

610
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,360
I gentrified the area.

611
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,740
They should be worshipping me.

612
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:32,880
Alright.

613
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,600
Let's get out of here.

614
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:51,020
here here they came across on light bridges yeah where did
the bridge go i have an idea to get us across they're not

now this whole place got re-renovated or some shit like if

625
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:33,870

back to its source to them the natural resources none more

626
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:44,090
so hi the light elf success came at a terrible price
withered into a storm-ridden wasteland soon after the

627
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:56,190
creation of this temple oh that's bad but that's really bad

00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:53,250
I'll need my rage meter.

636
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:56,670
This is the only way I can solve my problems.

637
00:45:57,390 --> 00:45:58,030
Okay, that's good.

638
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:58,910
These guys don't.

00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:04,490
All right, give me the rage meter!

640
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:07,990
Oh my god, he's literally useless.

641
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:10,150
Wait, what?

642
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:12,070
quickly tapped it.

643
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:12,070
Oh.

644
00:46:13,330 --> 00:46:13,610

Oh my god.

649
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:26,490
Wait.

650
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:26,830
Okay.

651
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:28,490
Now he does something.

652
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:30,690
The fucking one time.

653
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:31,610
Come on.

654
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:33,870
I'm trying to shield bash you.

655
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:38,290
Oh, yeah.

656
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:39,390
Oh, there's still one more.

657
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:40,370
Oh.

658
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:47,870
There's is the last guy i don't have xp oh there you go i
got xp i get it now why they keep fighting dark elves want

659
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:54,250
the souls and the light left alone but the light elves want
to keep using them that's the long and short of it hi oh no

660
00:46:54,250 --> 00:47:06,630
which side is right yeah oh this is an elven conflict i said
as much the last time we were now fine oh no we picked the

661
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:17,850
wrong side guys i don't understand the dark elves were so
aggressive though if they explained their side maybe i

662
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:25,190
wouldn't have exterminated their kind why didn't they
explain it better i'm stupid

663
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:38,090
i'm stupid L problems, not our problems.

664
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:42,070
But we still, like, killed off the dark Ls.

665
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:43,930
Alright,

666
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,280
we gotta lower this.

667
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:57,640
Where am I turning it to?

668
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,640
Press L to holding the crown to aim.

669
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,100
Oh, my axe.

670
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,900
That's true, we're evening it out right now.

671
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:19,920
that is true oh it's right here okay guys we are we are
evening it out by by killing off the light elves then

672
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:25,720
there's no more and there's no more elves which means no
more conflict think about that

673
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:36,600
no more elves means no more conflict Is that how it works?

674
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:40,480
Oh, no, that's not how it works.

675
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:42,680
True.

676
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:43,560
Technically true.

677
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:44,640
Technically true.

678
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:45,700
You think about it.

679
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:46,320
There you go.

680
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:47,660
That was midway.

681
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:50,580
Let's continue our ascent.

682
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:55,460
I'm the genius.

683
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,220
I fixed war.

684
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,900
I should be a negotiator.

685
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:13,920
I Did it guys, I don't think that's the way up to the shrine
we know it's my way Oh, I see it now forgive my impatience

686
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,800
How do I tricky what?

687
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:36,110
What exactly we're bringing balance to the world

688
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:46,810
There's got to be a way to get your axe behind this great
right I mean, I can pull up.

689
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:49,650
If I pull it down...

690
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:53,210
Ah...

691
00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:54,370
Oh my god.

692
00:49:55,470 --> 00:49:58,070
Kratos would never be able to solve these puzzles for real.

693
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:01,690
I refuse to believe it.

694
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:09,630
I don't mean to speak out of turn, but the white marble wall
behind that grate, perhaps your axe can reach it.

695
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:33,010
what what what where

696
00:50:46,760 --> 00:51:03,220

oh there we go i just slowly backed away thanks dear i love
they give us super chat thank you should get the stone wall

700
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:40,320
shield it lets you store energy when you block and then you
can bash them with the state of energy yeah but when i get a

701
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:43,880
parry it looks so cool though and then we'll be like

702
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:56,840
people think are like more impressed when i get a parry even
though it only happens like um once every 20 attempts but

703
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:14,180
those but that's the but that's the ray i'll take that oh

704
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:16,100

705
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:29,800
yeah when it hits it hits and then be like whoa quite the
collection of portugal so surprised why people are known for

706
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:38,200
their culture not surprised esteem Yeah, I live for that 20.

707
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:39,220
Oh, that's a little too high.

708
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,640
I live for that 2%.

709
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:45,880
Those are the odds I like.

710
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:47,640
Yeah, I think it was super chat.

711
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:47,920
Thank you.

712
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:48,700
Thank you.

713
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:51,360
You fix war.

714
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,740
It's almost like you're some sort of god of war.

715
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:55,320
Exactly.

716
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,900
That's why I'm perfect at fixing war.

717
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:01,200
Oh, my God.

718
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:02,000
He's so fast.

719
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:04,660
Watch your right.

720
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:06,940
That's fuck you.

721
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:07,820
Whoa, shit.

722
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,240
Oh, my God.

723
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:11,860
I don't understand.

724
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:12,600
Why couldn't I?

725
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:17,320
Bam!

726
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:18,360
Look at that.

727
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:21,660
See, I told you it looks so cool when I hit.

728
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:23,160
When I hit, I hit.

729
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,660
It makes not hitting it so worth it.

730
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:32,140
Bam.

731
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:34,360
Have I been here?

732
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:36,560
No.

733
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:45,290
All right, nice.

734
00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:49,190
All right, here we go.

735
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:49,930
Go up.

736
00:53:57,130 --> 00:53:58,930
Let's see if I can upgrade anything.

737
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:01,950
I feel like I should be able to upgrade my skills now.

738
00:54:02,870 --> 00:54:03,750
I feel like I have a lot.

739
00:54:04,370 --> 00:54:06,790
I just need a better axe, honestly.

740
00:54:07,730 --> 00:54:09,190
I should really...

741
00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:10,590
Well, I should use my blades more.

742
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:12,350
This is a...

743
00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:15,150
Oh, yeah, no, I can definitely upgrade all of this.

744
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:17,110
Arteus, are you good enough, boy?

745
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:19,650
Uh...

746
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:22,090
I will give him this.

747
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:26,890
Alright, I want him to be aggressive!

748
00:54:29,290 --> 00:54:29,690
Whoa!

749
00:54:30,110 --> 00:54:31,070
Tear can really jump.

750
00:54:33,790 --> 00:54:34,750
Wait, where did he go?

751
00:54:35,270 --> 00:54:36,230
Oh, he went this way.

752
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:42,050
Where the fuck did I do this?

753
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:42,350
Okay, I...

754
00:54:42,370 --> 00:54:43,370
I had to go here.

755
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:46,730
Oh,

756
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:49,970
wait.

757
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:54,910
If he's supposed to go that way, what's over here, though?

758
00:54:57,550 --> 00:54:59,190
See, he didn't go that way.

759
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:03,430
Yeah!

760
00:55:03,890 --> 00:55:04,950
He's getting the hang of it.

761
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:09,170
I've never seen the light elf have so much control over the
tower.

762
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:11,150
Yes, that's on us.

763
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:14,670
I have to do that here.

764
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:16,390
I have to do that here.

765
00:55:16,390 --> 00:55:17,390
The Dark Elf King.

766
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:19,650
Guess he's in the light now too.

767
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:22,030
What's that for?

768
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:27,430
Oh this!

769
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:29,430
Oh shit.

770
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:33,290
Gravity!

771
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:38,340
Okay.

772
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:44,180
Oh.

773
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:44,760
Whoops.

774
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:47,640
I didn't do this.

775
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:49,460
I know geometry.

776
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:51,880
Okay.

777
00:55:58,460 --> 00:55:58,920
Yay!

778
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:00,440
Yay!

779
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:00,940
Ah, I see.

780
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,120
The timing must be precise.

781
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,160
I told you.

782
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:06,580
I know geometry.

783
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:11,020
Yay!

784
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:15,260
Just time, just time.

785
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:19,340
You find references that are Sony facts?

786
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:19,860
fact.

787
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:20,600
Oh, that's cool.

788
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:21,900
I'm ready to give him a super chat.

789
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:22,200
Thank you.

790
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:22,840
Thank you.

791
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:24,760
Oh, I got a shortcut from this, too.

792
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:25,600
That's nice.

793
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:27,360
I love shortcuts.

794
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:30,440
This mystic doesn't see us.

795
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:32,120
There's Twilight Stone in the ground.

796
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:41,010
Ha ha.

797
00:56:41,330 --> 00:56:41,810
Stupid.

798
00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:43,590
Ha.

799
00:56:43,590 --> 00:56:44,910
We can continue up this way.

800
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:48,690
How can he not see?

801
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:49,890
Just open your eyes.

802
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:50,970
Father, over here.

803
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:55,550
Yeah.

804
00:56:56,990 --> 00:56:59,070
All right, we'll find Freya's brother.

805
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:03,610
With Freya's brother, then we can repair our relationship
with her.

806
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:09,530
Oh, it's that easy.

807
00:57:10,110 --> 00:57:10,410
Whoa!

808
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:11,650
You know what?

809
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:12,690
I'm gonna try the...

810
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:14,650
I'm gonna try the flame blades.

811
00:57:15,290 --> 00:57:17,350
I feel like I haven't done that in a while.

812
00:57:20,350 --> 00:57:21,250
That's right!

813
00:57:23,330 --> 00:57:23,850
Ah!

814
00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:27,430
Oh, there you go.

815
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:28,050
Yeah, he did.

816
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:32,550
That's right.

817
00:57:32,970 --> 00:57:33,850
Be aggressive!

818
00:57:37,850 --> 00:57:40,550
I ain't letting you become the god of mischief.

819
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:42,130
I can't figure out how they're making light bridges.

820
00:57:43,150 --> 00:57:43,770
Look at this statue.

821
00:57:43,890 --> 00:57:45,250
If I can stop him.

822
00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:49,750
Wee!

823
00:57:52,390 --> 00:57:53,750
Is it working?

824
00:57:56,130 --> 00:57:59,730
You think it's working guys?

825
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:07,900
Boopie!

826
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:11,720
Bum bum bum bum bum bum.

827
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:15,220
I should have moved it.

828
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:19,940
Oh it was just that easy.

829
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:24,120
Why the fuck was I throwing my axe there?

830
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,060
Oh I could have used it.

831
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:36,320

Yeah, I think Guy's not as bright anyway.

836
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:07,410
I do appreciate that.

837
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:10,850
Why must they insist on these frustrating trials?

838
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:12,530
Oh, my God.

839
00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:15,650
I can't remember the last time I visited the Norns.

840
00:59:16,330 --> 00:59:17,470
Nor do I wish to try.

841
00:59:19,650 --> 00:59:21,510
Gone, gone, gone.

842
00:59:23,950 --> 00:59:25,490
I wish the last one.

843
00:59:31,630 --> 00:59:32,130

You're so useless.

You are so useless, bro.

851
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:25,120
Literally, what's the point?

852
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:33,860
Oh my god.

853
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:36,380
Why is he in my party?

854
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:39,900
Why can't I just fucking throw him out of my party?

855
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:42,100
Watch out.

856
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:48,520
I'm trying to do this goddamn puzzle and then Tear fucking
throws him away.

857
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:53,280
Where the fuck is the last one?

858
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:57,080

859
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:58,300
Where's three?

860
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:03,300
Get down, Mr. President.

861
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:06,820
That's where the fuck is the third gun?

862
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:16,360
I looked at it.

863
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:19,060
I see one, two.

01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:23,640

866
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:32,280
Right to the chest.

867
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:33,100
Oh my god.

868
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:35,040
What's here?

869
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:36,860
Oh my god, is it this?

870
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:43,980
Where have I been here before?

871
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:53,720

873
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:05,340

And I get thrown, like, the fucking thing got thrown at me.

876
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:29,190
I was like, oh, where is he?

877
01:02:30,130 --> 01:02:31,650
Are you serious?

878
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:37,360
God damn it.

879
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:39,780
Oh, yeah, you didn't see that.

880
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:41,760
You didn't see that.

881
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:47,500
Just need to do it a little quicker, I think.

882
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:50,780
Are you?

883
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:51,680
Oh, my God.

884
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:56,100
Okay, I have to do this again.

885
01:02:56,620 --> 01:02:57,440
I get it now.

886
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:00,460
That's why there is a reflector.

887
01:03:09,530 --> 01:03:10,470
There we go.

888
01:03:13,070 --> 01:03:14,590
I also accidentally was doing the heavy throws.

889
01:03:14,830 --> 01:03:17,570
Oh my god, I can't fucking open it because there's one
health here.

890
01:03:18,090 --> 01:03:19,110
You know, my son was right.

891
01:03:21,890 --> 01:03:22,710
He was right.

892
01:03:25,550 --> 01:03:27,210
Oh my god, I'm just gonna...

893
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:28,310
Don't make me throw this at you.

894
01:03:28,330 --> 01:03:30,570
Oh my god, fuck this guy.

895
01:03:30,670 --> 01:03:31,390
You know what?

896
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:31,870
Fuck this.

897
01:03:31,990 --> 01:03:32,750
I know what to do.

898
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:38,280
Oh shit!

899
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:43,220
Bam!

900
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:50,460
There you go.

901
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:54,280
Which fine, I got shield.

902
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:59,560
Okay, that's not one, that's two.

903
01:04:06,570 --> 01:04:12,730

01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:48,990
All right, let's go.

907
01:04:50,170 --> 01:04:51,410
Let's go up.

908
01:04:54,940 --> 01:04:56,820
It's okay, I just didn't tell him to go up.

909
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:00,280
Yo, chill.

910
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:06,620
All right, up we go.

911
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:28,880
He's waiting for the calls dokey i come i can make my own
angle there's any way to stop the elves from fighting each

912
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:37,280
other had frayer not abandoned the realm a lasting peace may
have formed but now can we really place all the blame unfair

913
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:45,320
this war started long before his that is true though he had
the power to heal this land and end the war did he not he

914
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:51,660
made his choice the wrong Okay, well, you're not doing
anything better.

915
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:04,420
I will have to say, like, he didn't make a good choice
either, so should you really judge him?

916
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:06,140
Yeah?

917
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:10,640
Like, you weren't any better than him.

918
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:15,760
Like, bro, you got your own problems.

919
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:24,460
Ah, that should work.

920
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:31,740
You have a failed rebellion.

921
01:06:36,470 --> 01:06:39,830
Everyone has problems and everyone judges.

922
01:06:40,270 --> 01:06:40,750
Not me!

923
01:06:42,110 --> 01:06:43,410
I'm perfect!

924
01:06:50,870 --> 01:06:52,390
So how am I supposed to go?

925
01:06:53,990 --> 01:06:55,010
Except don't eat.

926
01:06:55,370 --> 01:06:56,130
Oh.

927
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:08,160
Am I looking at the wrong way?

928
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:10,360
Is that not where I'm supposed to push it?

929
01:07:26,590 --> 01:07:29,190
Yeah, there's no other way for me to push this.

930
01:07:35,410 --> 01:07:35,770
Oh!

931
01:07:37,810 --> 01:07:39,470
There we go.

932
01:07:39,470 --> 01:07:42,050
I was gonna sit.

933
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:43,150
That doesn't make sense.

934
01:07:49,830 --> 01:07:50,410
Oh!

935
01:07:53,190 --> 01:07:53,770
Okay.

936
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:01,360
Huh.

937
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:05,400
Maybe from this angle?

938
01:08:08,740 --> 01:08:09,220
No?

939
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:13,020
What angle should I hit it from?

940
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:17,600
This angle?

941
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:19,800
There must be a way to move this statue.

942
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:39,180
still so far which angle should it I thought that was the
right angle oh wait wait wait I figured out yeah there's

943
01:08:43,710 --> 01:08:54,610
no other oh wait there is another wing oh my god I didn't
see that about up there what the fuck are you pointing at

944
01:08:54,610 --> 01:09:19,360
boy how would we shoot that I don't think he can oh I see it
now the wings are connected back here hey father yeah I

945
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:25,280
could tell it's up there but I can't from below I

946
01:09:31,450 --> 01:09:33,110
don't think it reached up here.

947
01:09:34,950 --> 01:09:35,390
Yeah.

948
01:09:37,950 --> 01:09:39,950
I don't even know where it is.

949
01:09:44,330 --> 01:09:45,710
Okay, up where?

950
01:09:51,210 --> 01:09:53,930
Yeah, there's no way I can reach that.

951
01:09:57,270 --> 01:09:58,230
Oh my god.

952
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:03,720
Okay, so...

953
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:06,280
I'm perfect, guys.

954
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:07,740
That looks right.

955
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:11,880
I'm perfect.

956
01:10:20,990 --> 01:10:23,270
Are you fucking kidding me?

957
01:10:24,650 --> 01:10:25,030
Tear.

958
01:10:25,630 --> 01:10:29,070
The last time we were here, we killed the Dark Elk King.

959
01:10:29,710 --> 01:10:31,670
That's unfortunate.

960
01:10:31,870 --> 01:10:32,950
I'm so smart.

961
01:10:33,470 --> 01:10:35,010
I wondered what became of Spartan, daughter.

962
01:10:35,410 --> 01:10:36,750
We had to defend ourselves.

963
01:10:36,930 --> 01:10:40,130
But when he died, he told us we helped the wrong side.

964
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:43,130
Fine job, brother.

965
01:10:44,210 --> 01:10:46,050
This way, we're almost there.

966
01:10:46,090 --> 01:10:46,610
It's okay.

967
01:10:46,890 --> 01:10:48,370
We're going to even things out.

968
01:10:49,910 --> 01:10:50,750
Don't worry, guys.

969
01:10:50,990 --> 01:10:52,270
We're evening it out.

970
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:57,280
Yeah, geometry!

971
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:58,700
That's okay, guys.

972
01:10:58,840 --> 01:10:59,080
I'm EP.

973
01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:03,700
Do you still hear something wounded out there?

974
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:05,460
I think so.

975
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:06,660
Who is it?

976
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:07,280
Is it a storm?

977
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:08,460
Is it a bear?

978
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:12,280
Once we've uncovered a mysterious seer's hidden prophecy.

979
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:12,580
Ah!

980
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,640
Okay, we'll look on the ground.

981
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:22,500
I'm going to look at the ground.

982
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:23,340
I can't.

983
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:26,840
Oh my gosh, it's so obnoxious.

984
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:32,840
That is actually so obnoxious.

985
01:11:33,940 --> 01:11:35,060
It is way too bright.

986
01:11:35,260 --> 01:11:36,780
Oh my god, my eyes adjusted to it.

987
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:37,360
Thank God.

988
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:41,660
adjusted to it

989
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:55,990
what did he say i was not listening my i was she was too
bright what's supposed to do

990
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:10,460
there's some sounds down up there is quite nicely with the
twilight oh there it is i didn't see that good job boy you

991
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:18,820

speed this up What?

992
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:21,920
Oh, nice.

993
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:25,060
Yeah, I did it.

994
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:26,320
At your service.

995
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:30,660
Yeah, it was too bright that I couldn't hear interfered with
my ears.

996
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:34,440
Wait, there's a chest over here.

997
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:35,940
Nothing.

998
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:36,840
What's wrong?

999
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:38,100
Wait, how do I get over there?

1000
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:39,300
Mother inside last time.

1001
01:12:40,220 --> 01:12:41,100
But I can't anymore.

1002
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:43,580
Her soul is one with the light now.

1003
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:45,360
United by forces.

1004
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:46,480
How do I get over there?

1005
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:49,580
She is at peace, Atreus.

1006
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:51,720
Yeah, actually useful for once.

1007
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:52,980
And Father went inside the light.

1008
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:53,960
He said he...

1009
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:55,420
You went inside the light of Altheim?

1010
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:56,000
Yeah.

1011
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:57,100
What's wrong with that?

1012
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:00,700
And yet here you stand of sound mind and decidedly not...

1013
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:01,420
Yeah, like it's hard?

1014
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:02,900
You must tell me, Kratos.

1015
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:04,220
What did you see?

1016
01:13:04,740 --> 01:13:06,540
That memory is for me alone.

1017
01:13:07,740 --> 01:13:09,420
But I felt only moments pass.

1018
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:11,500
Didn't feel like moments to me.

1019
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:12,440
I was trapped.

1020
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:15,860
Atreus overcame great odds to save me.

1021
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:18,340
One could but only imagine.

1022
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:21,800
Well then, grow as Trip-Tick awaits.

1023
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:24,040
Oh, but what about the loot?

1024
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:25,040
Can I go back down?

1025
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:27,100
I can't even go down!

1026
01:13:28,420 --> 01:13:29,140
What the loot?

1027
01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:31,400
Oh my god, I'm stuck in like slow mode too.

1028
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:32,260
That's the worst part.

1029
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:33,160
Is there any more?

1030
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:34,040
Do I have more upgrades?

1031
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:36,880
Oh no, I finished my upgrades now.

1032
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:38,240
It's just my boy.

1033
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:39,480
Like, a second.

1034
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:41,560
Double check something real quick.

1035
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:45,920
I just realized po po po po po po po po.

1036
01:13:47,020 --> 01:13:49,760
I just wanted to double check something real quick.

1037
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:50,920
All right.

1038
01:13:54,620 --> 01:13:55,260
Off the walk.

1039
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:57,760
It's the walk of shame.

1040
01:13:58,160 --> 01:13:59,400
So, did you ever meet Groa?

1041
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:01,460
Many times.

1042
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:03,340
Simple-minded.

1043
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:04,320
Thing on the super chat.

1044
01:14:04,420 --> 01:14:04,660
Thank you.

1045
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:05,340
Thank you.

1046
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:07,600
Conversation was difficult.

1047
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:09,040
You don't even know what holds.

1048
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:11,040
That's one thing I didn't know.

1049
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:12,700
I know all the other stuff.

1050
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:15,140
They give the super chat simple-minded.

1051
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:15,500
Thank you.

1052
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:16,160
Thank you.

1053
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:17,860
But stop.

1054
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:18,620
Think of the super chat.

1055
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:19,040
Thank you.

1056
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:19,700
Thank you.

1057
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:20,980
Your chieftain looks super cute.

1058
01:14:21,180 --> 01:14:23,740
You and the chie-chie-chie-chie first looks very jar-but
today.

1059
01:14:23,740 --> 01:14:24,080
Thank you.

1060
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:24,800
It was super chat.

1061
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:25,660
Thank you.

1062
01:14:25,940 --> 01:14:27,380
I'm just EP today.

1063
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:28,660
Don't worry.

1064
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,060
Next week, I'm less EP.

1065
01:14:34,010 --> 01:14:35,390
Did we skip the cutscene?

1066
01:14:35,770 --> 01:14:36,710
How do we skip it?

1067
01:14:38,050 --> 01:14:39,730
I didn't press anything.

1068
01:14:43,930 --> 01:14:45,030
Touch the lamp.

1069
01:14:45,710 --> 01:14:46,130
Touch it.

1070
01:14:48,070 --> 01:14:48,650
Touch it.

1071
01:14:50,910 --> 01:14:52,090
No, Yawana.

1072
01:14:52,950 --> 01:14:54,790
Come on, Kratos.

1073
01:14:56,190 --> 01:14:56,990
Touch the light.

1074
01:14:58,350 --> 01:15:00,610
What are you doing?

1075
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:03,290
Boy, you cock.

1076
01:15:03,790 --> 01:15:06,290
I heard something.

1077
01:15:06,490 --> 01:15:07,590
Calling for you.

1078
01:15:09,590 --> 01:15:12,430
Boy, I'll quave the forbidden light.

1079
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:20,420
How dare you get between me and my wife, boy?

1080
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:30,480
No!

1081
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:55,500

1082
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:59,980
there huh they've changed some stuff last time.

1083
01:16:00,860 --> 01:16:02,120
There was all this hive stuff up here.

1084
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:03,900
So many dark elves.

1085
01:16:06,060 --> 01:16:06,540
I...

1086
01:16:06,540 --> 01:16:08,660
All this time, I thought the dark elf came.

1087
01:16:09,780 --> 01:16:11,360
I thought all the dark elves were...

1088
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:12,280
Yeah, say it.

1089
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:13,320
We're what?

1090
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:13,820
Yes.

1091
01:16:14,140 --> 01:16:14,940
Say it.

1092
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:16,960
What were they?

1093
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:18,920
What were the dark elves are?

1094
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:20,100
What are they?

1095
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:23,640
What's the right question?

1096
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:25,700
Is there a right side?

1097
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:26,620
Exactly.

1098
01:16:27,940 --> 01:16:28,600
What do you think?

1099
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:29,480
Dark elves are what?

1100
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:41,580
there's no right side in this wall i i don't know then
perhaps you shouldn't pick one yeah which side is the right

1101
01:16:41,580 --> 01:16:44,440
side boy light side or dark side

1102
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:50,500
what are you implying

1103
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:04,740
um Because he won't stop me from touching my wife.

1104
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:06,820
Technically, I'm touching it right here.

1105
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:16,780
Whoa.

1106
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:21,960
That's because he hanged up with the dwarves for too long,
guys.

1107
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:23,000
Not my upbringing.

1108
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:24,260
I didn't raise...

1109
01:17:24,260 --> 01:17:26,020
I didn't raise a racist.

1110
01:17:27,740 --> 01:17:29,100
I didn't...

1111
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:30,360
He said it.

1112
01:17:30,940 --> 01:17:36,200
I fight everyone equally.

1113
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:40,780
Guys, I fought everyone equally.

1114
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:44,100
In fact, I'm out here going to wipe out the light elves.

1115
01:17:52,650 --> 01:17:55,410
I did like the tree hugger.

1116
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:10,750
Maybe that was the problem.

1117
01:18:14,410 --> 01:18:17,030
Yeah, I don't discriminate on who I kill.

1118
01:18:18,010 --> 01:18:19,510
I kill everyone I see.

1119
01:18:20,770 --> 01:18:25,270
So him, him saying all that, that's not on me.

1120
01:18:29,350 --> 01:18:32,570
Wait, if he goes this way, then I'm going to go to the right
side.

1121
01:18:33,450 --> 01:18:33,930
I knew it.

1122
01:18:33,930 --> 01:18:35,170
I knew there was a chest here.

1123
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:52,000
Yeah, I raised him to hate everyone.

1124
01:18:52,580 --> 01:18:53,060
Exactly.

1125
01:18:54,460 --> 01:18:56,600
No matter what kind you are.

1126
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:09,820
I just I'm just an asshole always did enjoy hiding their
secrets in plain sight wait until you see this Huh Touch the

1127
01:19:09,820 --> 01:19:11,780
wood boy touch it

1128
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:37,280
Okay All right, what do we see yes here we have drew a
search for her missing husband She was relentless in her

1129
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:47,600
attempt to find him meditated for weeks on end unfortunately
she found something else a vision of Ragnarok word of grow

1130
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:56,080
his vision reached Odin he sought her out demanded a private
retelling didn't like what he had oh why did he just kill

1131
01:19:56,080 --> 01:20:07,420
her she's just a messenger that's the I don't know just a
messenger you just killed the Prophet curious whatever I i

1132
01:20:07,420 --> 01:20:15,060
know some giants thought so but ironwood isn't anywhere lad
it's a concept a metaphorical paradise it's not real

1133
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:22,320
presumably grower requested her ashes be returned to yoden
high while her soul found peace in the light difficult to

1134
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:32,600
imagine odin respecting those wishes hmm the champion i
think it's supposed to be is that you you assume too much

1135
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:33,280
yeah i was gonna

1136
01:20:37,420 --> 01:20:47,920
are slippery by nature you're not there yet more obvious
than others oh no that was the end of everything so this is

1137
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:54,920
it there's nothing we can do to stop it there must be a way
it's okay we'll just go to another dimension i did that last

1138
01:20:54,920 --> 01:21:07,080
time look there's other mythologies we could go it's you
fighting in ragnarok no what i don't i can't what why not

1139
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:10,280
What's this thing?

1140
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:11,060
Yeah.

1141
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:12,500
That's new.

1142
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:13,560
Huh?

1143
01:21:17,550 --> 01:21:18,490
Asgard is destroyed?

1144
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:25,040
Wait, Tyr's gonna destroy Asgard?

1145
01:21:28,150 --> 01:21:30,570
But the other realms thrive?

1146
01:21:34,790 --> 01:21:35,890
Oh, he's gone.

1147
01:21:37,290 --> 01:21:38,530
He's gonna kill Odin?

1148
01:21:38,650 --> 01:21:39,890
And Odin dies.

1149
01:21:40,010 --> 01:21:40,230
Yeah.

1150
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:46,000
She lied.

1151
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:48,000
You're all alive.

1152
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:50,420
Of course she did.

1153
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:53,400
Odin's working off a false prophecy.

1154
01:21:55,940 --> 01:21:58,100
So then we can win Ragnarok.

1155
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:01,200
We can beat Odin.

1156
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:03,600
We are not present in any of this.

1157
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:06,440
But that was Tyr leading the charge against Asgard.

1158
01:22:07,540 --> 01:22:09,300
Plus, Hell's army was there.

1159
01:22:10,260 --> 01:22:11,020
And the elves.

1160
01:22:12,220 --> 01:22:12,780
Champion.

1161
01:22:14,740 --> 01:22:15,300
Okay.

1162
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:17,180
Whoever that is doesn't matter.

1163
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:27,380
for the first time we know something odin doesn't we just
saw we can win so in the prophecy like the original prophecy

1164
01:22:27,380 --> 01:22:40,740
odin wins to define my choices but but we just saw no atreus
this is wrong why is it wrong don't you want odin to be dead

1165
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:51,060
come there is much so like the original prophecy that we
thought we knew odin wins is it like odin wins the war

1166
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:57,640
how come he didn't like it

1167
01:23:03,410 --> 01:23:16,690
oh the original is destruction of everything we can't stop
ragnarok but we can win it and then the actual prophecy is

1168
01:23:16,690 --> 01:23:18,610
that Asgard dies.

1169
01:23:23,030 --> 01:23:24,150
End of all realm.

1170
01:23:24,210 --> 01:23:25,090
What the fuck were it?

1171
01:23:25,230 --> 01:23:25,670
How did...

1172
01:23:25,670 --> 01:23:25,870
What?

1173
01:23:28,150 --> 01:23:29,230
What the...

1174
01:23:29,230 --> 01:23:32,010
I was just like, I'm done with my prophecy.

1175
01:23:32,390 --> 01:23:32,850
What the...

1176
01:23:32,850 --> 01:23:33,310
Oh my god.

1177
01:23:33,370 --> 01:23:34,450
What is he doing here?

1178
01:23:34,890 --> 01:23:38,370
Okay, so the original prophecy was right now ends all
realms.

1179
01:23:39,410 --> 01:23:41,130
And then he had to kill Tear off.

1180
01:23:41,770 --> 01:23:43,950
He had to imprison Tear so that doesn't happen.

1181
01:23:44,710 --> 01:23:46,850
But then she didn't tell...

1182
01:23:46,970 --> 01:23:52,350
that it was just Asgard's realm and Odin dies.

1183
01:23:52,950 --> 01:23:55,030
What the fuck, would you not be happy about that?

1184
01:23:55,230 --> 01:23:56,650
Bro, you were like, fuck Odin.

1185
01:23:57,590 --> 01:23:59,550
So, what'd you see?

1186
01:23:59,930 --> 01:24:00,610
A lie.

1187
01:24:01,410 --> 01:24:02,510
Roa lied to Odin.

1188
01:24:03,390 --> 01:24:04,810
Ragnarok isn't the end of everything.

1189
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:06,630
Yeah, it's just the end of Asgard.

1190
01:24:07,110 --> 01:24:07,710
Yeah, everyone.

1191
01:24:08,090 --> 01:24:09,650
The destruction of an entire realm is it?

1192
01:24:10,210 --> 01:24:12,710
To say nothing of its citizenry, it's wildlife.

1193
01:24:12,990 --> 01:24:14,830
Okay, everyone fucking hates Asgard here.

1194
01:24:15,070 --> 01:24:15,950
Goddamn hippie.

1195
01:24:16,070 --> 01:24:16,450
Enough.

1196
01:24:17,290 --> 01:24:19,970
There's much to discuss once we are safe at home.

1197
01:24:20,630 --> 01:24:21,890
Yeah, you fucking hippie?

1198
01:24:22,250 --> 01:24:22,710
Come on.

1199
01:24:22,770 --> 01:24:25,390
He fucking imprisoned you for hundreds of years.

1200
01:24:25,550 --> 01:24:27,230
You didn't eat water or food.

1201
01:24:28,290 --> 01:24:29,950
You should be happy about this.

1202
01:24:36,940 --> 01:24:38,120
Yeah, shields.

1203
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:43,540
Tears from Asgard too.

1204
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:44,800
Yeah, he can just go move.

1205
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:49,960
We can move.

1206
01:24:52,380 --> 01:24:54,800
Oh, Runic 30, though.

1207
01:25:00,980 --> 01:25:01,160
Ah.

1208
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:06,180
Wait, that seems so cool.

1209
01:25:11,410 --> 01:25:13,730
But then my defense goes up.

1210
01:25:15,490 --> 01:25:18,830
I'm going to craft this to see how much I need to upgrade.

1211
01:25:19,850 --> 01:25:21,610
Okay, can I upgrade this?

1212
01:25:21,730 --> 01:25:22,970
I can't upgrade this.

1213
01:25:23,050 --> 01:25:23,730
Okay, never mind.

1214
01:25:23,790 --> 01:25:24,350
It doesn't matter.

1215
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:26,830
I can't even upgrade it.

1216
01:25:38,390 --> 01:25:39,030
Hmm.

1217
01:25:39,050 --> 01:25:44,610
I can't upgrade anything anyway Wait, can I in fate's
injury.

1218
01:25:44,990 --> 01:25:47,090
Oh, of course not just move

1219
01:25:50,250 --> 01:25:51,830
There's only one thing.

1220
01:25:52,010 --> 01:26:02,170
It's like the trolley problem To be fair everyone in Asgard
are assholes anyway, so like who cares Throw assholes tier

1221
01:26:02,170 --> 01:26:06,010
they literally eliminated a bunch of people

1222
01:26:13,950 --> 01:26:17,750
So it's fine Don't worry, bro.

1223
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:27,240
Yeah.

1224
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:28,460
We can move here.

1225
01:26:28,900 --> 01:26:30,720
See, this place ain't so bad.

1226
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:32,120
What do you mean I got the wrong armor?

1227
01:26:32,780 --> 01:26:33,440
I think I got it.

1228
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:34,300
It's the right way.

1229
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:35,660
Really?

1230
01:26:36,140 --> 01:26:37,840
The one I have right now is better.

1231
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:38,780
Isn't it?

1232
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:41,240
Yeah, because this is less strength.

1233
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:44,900
That's like 12, and this one's 18.

1234
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:50,640
Yeah, I think my armor's stuff is fine so

1235
01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:09,040
he doesn't we found out that it's just his only and why the
fuck why was he even particularly mad no reason to be that

1236
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:20,940
man we just found out that perhaps we should focus on oh
shit oops oh i just realized i don't have my knife i'm just

1237
01:27:20,940 --> 01:27:29,300
literally Bye-bye.

1238
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:33,140
That was fine.

1239
01:27:36,580 --> 01:27:37,460
Smashy, smashy!

1240
01:27:37,660 --> 01:27:37,800
Yay!

1241
01:27:39,740 --> 01:27:41,320
God, why does he get so little?

1242
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:42,860
My boy gets so little XP.

1243
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:47,460
Have you ever been to Asgard?

1244
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:50,200
I don't think... I don't think Kratos been to Asgard, right?

1245
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:53,120
Pretty sure.

1246
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:54,460
That's right.

1247
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:55,480
I'm angry now!

1248
01:27:55,780 --> 01:27:56,480
Just for you!

1249
01:27:56,540 --> 01:28:08,060
This is a special frozen and then i'm lessing i'm like all

01:28:08,060 --> 01:28:09,320

1251
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:16,260
oh he just wants to kill my boy that's fine i'm fine with
that

1252
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:23,900
i don't think he's allowed an ass guard i'm pretty sure

1253
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:36,600
Oh, goodbye.

1254
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:39,060
Goodbye.

1255
01:28:46,900 --> 01:28:47,480
Where are they?

1256
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:48,360
Oh, there he is.

1257
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:50,760
Oh, they're so far.

1258
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:51,320
That's fine.

1259
01:28:51,460 --> 01:28:53,180
I'll just let my boy do all the way.

1260
01:28:55,260 --> 01:28:56,280
Oh, my god.

1261
01:28:56,440 --> 01:28:57,860
The stupid fucking pole.

1262
01:28:58,900 --> 01:28:59,540
Oh, my god.

1263
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:00,840
The stupid balcony.

1264
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:07,060
Yeah.

1265
01:29:07,460 --> 01:29:07,560
Yeah.

1266
01:29:11,210 --> 01:29:12,430
Yeah, that's good.

1267
01:29:12,770 --> 01:29:13,970
Oh shit, what the fuck?

1268
01:29:19,410 --> 01:29:20,290
That's right.

1269
01:29:20,570 --> 01:29:21,870
The gift of strength!

1270
01:29:24,710 --> 01:29:25,350
That's right!

1271
01:29:25,350 --> 01:29:25,850
Watch your right!

1272
01:29:29,110 --> 01:29:29,950
That's right.

1273
01:29:29,950 --> 01:29:30,250
Fire!

1274
01:29:31,670 --> 01:29:34,130
That's right with the power of fire!

1275
01:29:35,350 --> 01:29:36,350
Oh shit.

1276
01:29:36,810 --> 01:29:37,570
Let's vanish this.

1277
01:29:37,770 --> 01:29:38,690
It's just a flesh wound.

1278
01:29:40,670 --> 01:29:41,970
Oh my god, never mind.

1279
01:29:42,090 --> 01:29:43,690
Oh my god, but that looks so sick, though.

1280
01:29:46,110 --> 01:29:47,090
There you go, it's fine.

1281
01:29:47,530 --> 01:29:48,990
Got my HP back.

1282
01:29:50,550 --> 01:29:52,310
I don't know, I still like the axe more.

1283
01:29:53,790 --> 01:29:55,230
I think the axe is better.

1284
01:29:57,370 --> 01:29:57,810
IMO.

1285
01:29:59,550 --> 01:30:01,210
Alright, what the fuck is...

1286
01:30:01,210 --> 01:30:02,490
Oh, it's the little lizards.

1287
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:07,060
Wait.

1288
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:11,460
Oh shit, like, what the fuck is so fast?

1289
01:30:12,180 --> 01:30:13,000
Oh, hey, nice.

1290
01:30:13,300 --> 01:30:13,700
Friendly fire.

1291
01:30:13,860 --> 01:30:14,640
I love that.

1292
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:17,960
Thank God for friendly fire.

1293
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:22,980
But where did he go?

1294
01:30:26,890 --> 01:30:28,810
Oh, I can go both ways.

1295
01:30:29,890 --> 01:30:30,710
But I want to go back up.

1296
01:30:35,730 --> 01:30:36,130
Wait.

1297
01:30:37,090 --> 01:30:38,230
Where there was loot down there?

1298
01:30:38,310 --> 01:30:38,850
I didn't check.

1299
01:30:40,390 --> 01:30:41,470
I didn't double check.

1300
01:30:41,650 --> 01:30:43,070
And also, it's my wife's axe, too.

1301
01:30:43,470 --> 01:30:46,110
I feel closer to her when I use it.

1302
01:30:46,910 --> 01:30:48,210
You know, it's more romantic.

1303
01:30:50,370 --> 01:30:50,670
You know?

1304
01:30:50,870 --> 01:30:52,170
It's so romantic.

1305
01:30:54,070 --> 01:30:56,510
I use the axe that my wife has.

1306
01:30:56,910 --> 01:30:57,590
Oh, shit!

1307
01:30:57,730 --> 01:30:58,230
Oh, my God.

1308
01:30:58,330 --> 01:30:58,690
That's you.

1309
01:30:59,810 --> 01:31:00,570
There we go.

1310
01:31:00,690 --> 01:31:01,410
That was you.

1311
01:31:07,540 --> 01:31:09,220
We need to keep moving.

1312
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,020
He's really worked up.

1313
01:31:11,380 --> 01:31:13,360
Yeah, why is he so worked up?

1314
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:17,240
Like, Where are we going, bro?

1315
01:31:19,420 --> 01:31:19,840
What?

1316
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:21,520
Oh, wait.

1317
01:31:21,740 --> 01:31:21,820
Look.

1318
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:30,990
Yeah, but it has your previous...

1319
01:31:30,990 --> 01:31:32,650
We're thinking about now, okay?

1320
01:31:34,770 --> 01:31:35,610
This way.

1321
01:31:37,390 --> 01:31:39,030
Yeah, but like...

1322
01:31:39,030 --> 01:31:41,610
That arc is over for me, alright, guys?

1323
01:31:41,770 --> 01:31:42,850
It's all about my new...

1324
01:31:42,850 --> 01:31:44,190
My new dead wife.

1325
01:31:45,950 --> 01:31:47,490
We gotta move forward.

1326
01:31:47,650 --> 01:31:49,270
This is about my new dead wife.

1327
01:31:49,270 --> 01:31:51,610
Not my old dead wife

1328
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:04,220
Yeah, out with the old in with the new

1329
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:13,120
All right, nice

1330
01:32:25,580 --> 01:32:29,340
We killed someone oh my god alpha

1331
01:32:32,820 --> 01:32:36,100
Bro that was like It's fine, I'm gonna use this.

1332
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:37,780
Oh, he's like, I'll kill her!

1333
01:32:39,980 --> 01:32:42,840
You become welcome back, God of War.

1334
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:46,220
I'm so proud of you.

1335
01:32:46,980 --> 01:32:47,600
Finally!

1336
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:51,680
You have finally become the God of War!

1337
01:32:54,680 --> 01:32:55,640
You're back!

1338
01:32:56,500 --> 01:32:57,020
Yappa!

1339
01:33:05,900 --> 01:33:07,660
All right, that's fine.

1340
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:13,140
There you go.

1341
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:14,280
Fine.

1342
01:33:16,060 --> 01:33:16,780
Boom!

1343
01:33:17,700 --> 01:33:18,480
That's fucking right!

1344
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:20,440
Let's go, boy!

1345
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:22,100
It's family bonding time!

1346
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:22,880
Oh, shit!

1347
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:24,420
The alpha!

1348
01:33:25,140 --> 01:33:25,840
The alpha!

1349
01:33:27,060 --> 01:33:27,700
That's right.

1350
01:33:27,780 --> 01:33:29,820
I'm gonna make her a beta right now.

1351
01:33:31,100 --> 01:33:32,020
Against the fake!

1352
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:35,760
What?

1353
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:38,140
Okay, that was bullshit.

1354
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:41,560
It's fine.

1355
01:33:45,870 --> 01:33:47,170
Oh, my God.

1356
01:33:47,330 --> 01:33:48,090
Did not see that.

1357
01:33:50,590 --> 01:33:52,430
He's like, oh, it's just a flesh wound.

1358
01:33:53,550 --> 01:33:53,950
Oh, shit.

1359
01:33:55,850 --> 01:33:56,730
Oh, my God.

1360
01:33:56,830 --> 01:33:57,650
Did you see that?

1361
01:33:58,030 --> 01:34:00,350
Oh, oh, my God.

1362
01:34:00,770 --> 01:34:02,130
Okay, that combo.

1363
01:34:05,270 --> 01:34:06,470
Okay, now...

It's more sick when I get those!

01:34:21,230 --> 01:34:22,630
That's fucking right!

1368
01:34:24,150 --> 01:34:25,730
And you said you're alpha.

01:34:27,170 --> 01:34:29,510
Three parries in a row!

01:34:32,390 --> 01:34:35,610

01:36:15,740 --> 01:36:16,320
That's why you...

1381
01:36:16,780 --> 01:36:20,120
I thought it was like... I thought it was just for fun.

1382

Nice.

Oh.

1386
01:36:45,980 --> 01:36:47,100
He's a hero.

1387
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:53,920
Yeah, I thought he was just regretting for killing the elf.

1388
01:36:54,060 --> 01:36:55,900
So you wanted to give her up your proper burial.

1389
01:36:59,740 --> 01:37:01,840
Oh, I got extra stun and damage.

1390
01:37:01,980 --> 01:37:02,640
Oh, that's cool.

1391
01:37:03,540 --> 01:37:04,560
A sovereign hunter.

1392
01:37:04,700 --> 01:37:06,120
Then you was super chetting, thank you.

1393
01:37:06,300 --> 01:37:07,420
I thought that's what it did.

1394

Thanks.

1395
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:12,980
And I'm sorry about before.

1396
01:37:13,680 --> 01:37:14,120
I...

1397
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:14,500
No.

1398
01:37:15,620 --> 01:37:16,520
I am sorry.

1399
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:19,380
I should never have come.

1400
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:21,140
What do you mean?

1401
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:22,800
We shouldn't linger.

1402
01:37:24,300 --> 01:37:25,540
Also, I hope the sound is alright.

1403
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:29,620
I pushed it up a little bit more than normal than my last
stream.

1404
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:31,800
So I hope it's not too loud now.

1405
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:41,480
Sound and good.

1406
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:43,440
I just want you guys to be able to hear the dialogue.

1407
01:37:47,660 --> 01:37:48,020
Look.

1408
01:37:49,080 --> 01:37:50,660
I just want to do the right thing.

1409
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:52,540
And according to prophecy...

1410
01:37:53,160 --> 01:37:54,300
Speak no more of prophecy.

1411
01:37:55,180 --> 01:38:04,760
War will not give you the purpose you seek atreus only
slaughter so what are we supposed to do roll over do nothing

1412
01:38:04,760 --> 01:38:09,800

01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:38,820
Guys, equality, guys.

1417

Wait, they're back?

1424
01:38:56,420 --> 01:38:58,500

I'm going to be angry.

1452
01:41:36,330 --> 01:41:39,190
It'll be a shame if there is a boss fight after that,
though.

1453
01:41:39,270 --> 01:41:39,850
I would...

1454
01:41:40,570 --> 01:41:41,890
It will be a shame.

1455
01:41:44,550 --> 01:41:46,210

1456
01:41:48,070 --> 01:41:48,590

01:41:54,210 --> 01:41:54,610
This way?

1461
01:41:54,830 --> 01:41:56,230
But this way might have loot.

1462
01:41:56,930 --> 01:41:58,310
Oh, it's the same way.

1463
01:42:02,390 --> 01:42:02,630

1464
01:42:02,750 --> 01:42:03,390
I'll wait for him.

1465
01:42:05,950 --> 01:42:07,870
Yes, guys, for planes only.

1466
01:42:09,170 --> 01:42:10,050
You have no rights.

1467
01:42:10,210 --> 01:42:12,510
Did you get a license to fly at this time?

1468
01:42:15,390 --> 01:42:17,370
Surely there's no boss right here, right?

1469
01:42:17,630 --> 01:42:18,110
Yeah.

1470
01:42:21,030 --> 01:42:21,990
Fair enough.

1471
01:42:23,690 --> 01:42:25,510
Oh my god, she's actually just frozen.

1472
01:42:26,170 --> 01:42:27,890
That's good for me.

1473
01:42:30,590 --> 01:42:32,350
Yeah, this is a no fly zone.

1474
01:42:34,670 --> 01:42:34,850
Oh!

1475
01:42:36,210 --> 01:42:36,690

1476
01:42:38,790 --> 01:42:39,750
Oh, again!

1477
01:42:42,150 --> 01:42:43,070
That's okay, right?

1478
01:42:43,450 --> 01:42:44,490
Okay, I didn't do that.

1479
01:42:44,630 --> 01:42:45,350
Okay, look, okay.

1480
01:42:46,450 --> 01:42:47,790
I might have missed that though.

1481
01:42:49,890 --> 01:42:50,270
It's alright.

1482
01:42:50,430 --> 01:42:51,530
I can just be angry.

1483
01:42:53,010 --> 01:42:53,790
No way.

1484
01:42:54,170 --> 01:42:58,010
I told you, it's just cooler when I hit that 1%.

1485
01:42:59,930 --> 01:43:00,870
What the fuck?

1486
01:43:03,170 --> 01:43:04,090
Oh my god.

1487
01:43:04,330 --> 01:43:05,090
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

It's fine.

1490
01:43:08,090 --> 01:43:08,830
It's fine.

1491
01:43:09,070 --> 01:43:09,630
It's fine.

1492
01:43:09,990 --> 01:43:11,290
I'm strong, though.

1493
01:43:13,590 --> 01:43:14,690

1494
01:43:15,010 --> 01:43:15,670

Wait, why are you ditching me?

1500

You're not even heading there.

No.

1546
01:47:08,190 --> 01:47:09,270

1588
01:49:44,370 --> 01:49:45,790
I hate Sand.

1589
01:49:46,330 --> 01:49:46,830
It's coarse.

1590
01:49:50,980 --> 01:49:53,320
Yeah, the top is literally still breakable.

1591
01:49:53,400 --> 01:49:54,380
I don't understand.

1592
01:49:55,040 --> 01:49:57,000
This cave extends underneath the desert.

1593
01:49:57,600 --> 01:49:58,640
Is the creature within?

1594
01:49:58,980 --> 01:50:00,800

We'll find it if we keep going.

1596
01:50:03,640 --> 01:50:04,420
What is this place?

1597
01:50:04,700 --> 01:50:07,300
I have huge for the Dark Elves by the looks of it.

1598
01:50:07,740 --> 01:50:10,120
One of the few to meaning know that they're barred from the
temple.

1599
01:50:10,900 --> 01:50:12,260
Ah, great.

1600
01:50:14,220 --> 01:50:16,400
It's okay, we're just making sure we kill equally.

1601
01:50:16,740 --> 01:50:19,980
Need equal amounts of Light Elves and Dark Elves, guys.

1602
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:22,620
I just needed to make sure.

1603
01:50:32,150 --> 01:50:33,150
That's fucking right.

1604
01:50:34,250 --> 01:50:34,930
here.

1605
01:50:35,950 --> 01:50:36,990
This is my area.

1606
01:50:40,230 --> 01:50:41,930
We're bringing balance.

1607
01:50:49,950 --> 01:50:50,290
There you go.

1608
01:50:50,730 --> 01:50:51,190
That's everything.

1609
01:50:52,230 --> 01:50:52,230
Yeah.

1610
01:50:58,830 --> 01:51:00,390
I did not know I could do that.

1611
01:51:00,590 --> 01:51:01,270
That's actually cool.

1612
01:51:05,330 --> 01:51:05,410
Yeah!

1613
01:51:06,670 --> 01:51:09,370
We can never is welcome back, sad lad.

1614
01:51:14,530 --> 01:51:15,690
Because I cut off his wings.

1615
01:51:15,810 --> 01:51:16,790
That's why he died.

1616
01:51:24,370 --> 01:51:25,110
What the fuck?

1617
01:51:28,050 --> 01:51:29,730
Oh my god, he just kept going.

1618
01:51:30,870 --> 01:51:31,910
I was like, what the fuck?

1619
01:51:32,030 --> 01:51:32,710
He just kept going.

1620
01:51:32,930 --> 01:51:33,750
Oh wait, this is perfect.

1621
01:51:36,110 --> 01:51:36,890
And again!

1622
01:51:46,510 --> 01:51:47,310
Alright, nice.

1623
01:51:49,530 --> 01:51:49,930

Sorry, don't worry, you'll see your wife in hell too.

1627
01:52:02,370 --> 01:52:03,370
Yeah, let's go.

1628
01:52:03,710 --> 01:52:07,930
Now that I know more about the Dark Elves, I wish we didn't
have to fight.

1629
01:52:08,550 --> 01:52:09,390
That's not what I want to do.

1630
01:52:11,070 --> 01:52:12,290
Yeah, that's on them.

1631
01:52:13,370 --> 01:52:14,370
Ah, this is self-defense.

1632
01:52:14,450 --> 01:52:17,830
The last time we were in Alphan, can you really blame them?

1633
01:52:20,730 --> 01:52:22,430
How the fuck do I hit this right?

1634
01:52:23,750 --> 01:52:24,770
Oh, there's...

1635
01:52:24,770 --> 01:52:25,270
I knew it.

1636
01:52:25,370 --> 01:52:26,550
I knew there was something up here.

1637
01:52:34,360 --> 01:52:35,900
And I'm going to go here.

1638
01:52:38,700 --> 01:52:39,940

01:52:40,760 --> 01:52:40,980

Is that not enough?

1656
01:54:44,490 --> 01:54:45,850
Do I have to go from this side?

1657
01:54:47,090 --> 01:54:49,830
Because I can't throw my axe from here.

1658
01:54:50,790 --> 01:54:51,030
Yeah.

1659
01:54:53,510 --> 01:54:54,230

Oh, there's the other side.

1663
01:55:03,790 --> 01:55:05,770
Yeah, because I can't throw my axe from this side.

1664
01:55:05,870 --> 01:55:06,830
But there is another way.

1677
01:55:54,820 --> 01:55:55,960
Oh, I can open this.

1678
01:55:56,120 --> 01:55:56,240
Oh!

01:55:56,640 --> 01:55:57,020
Yay!

1680
01:55:59,660 --> 01:56:03,860
Wait, if I can open this, how the fuck do I do the thing up

01:56:07,380 --> 01:56:08,660
Can I open this?

1682
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:10,040
No, I can't.

1683
01:56:14,240 --> 01:56:15,640
Oh no.

1684
01:56:17,420 --> 01:56:18,620
Not thinking.

1685
01:56:21,240 --> 01:56:22,650
Yeah, now what?

1686
01:56:24,160 --> 01:56:24,420
Oh!

1687
01:56:29,160 --> 01:56:30,220
Excuse me?

1688
01:56:31,100 --> 01:56:32,520
I thought I was so smart.

1689
01:56:32,720 --> 01:56:34,320
Are you fucking kidding me?

1690
01:56:38,050 --> 01:56:41,490
Oh, hey, I got...

1691
01:56:44,170 --> 01:56:45,670
I mean, okay.

1692
01:56:47,490 --> 01:56:47,970
Maybe.

1693
01:56:53,070 --> 01:56:56,250
I don't know, it was just a wild guess.

1694
01:56:59,310 --> 01:57:00,350
Sick throw.

1695
01:57:02,310 --> 01:57:03,970
Oh, no, I'll get over there.

1696
01:57:04,210 --> 01:57:09,090
I talked to animals or enchanted rings or whatever.

1697
01:57:09,750 --> 01:57:10,690
Much has changed.

1698
01:57:10,930 --> 01:57:12,830
Okay, boy, a personal space.

1699
01:57:13,090 --> 01:57:13,850
Well, yeah.

1700
01:57:14,410 --> 01:57:17,170
I'm just trying to figure out why you'd help some random
animals.

1701
01:57:17,490 --> 01:57:18,790
Personal space?

1702
01:57:19,450 --> 01:57:20,490
No, no, it is.

1703
01:57:21,010 --> 01:57:23,390
I'm just surprised it's what you want too.

1704
01:57:25,910 --> 01:57:27,210
Alright, now I can climb.

1705
01:57:27,390 --> 01:57:28,730
He actually was like...

1706
01:57:28,730 --> 01:57:30,030
He was way too close.

1707
01:57:30,450 --> 01:57:31,510
And I felt...

1708
01:57:31,510 --> 01:57:34,070
From my manlyhood, I felt uncomfortable.

1709
01:57:37,690 --> 01:57:38,910
Yes, there we go.

1710
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:48,500

I was like, I hope I have enough time.

1716
01:58:33,590 --> 01:58:35,870
Because I forgot it was left or right.

1717
01:58:43,930 --> 01:58:44,690

1747
02:00:39,010 --> 02:00:39,370
alpha.

1748
02:00:40,810 --> 02:00:41,870
Yeah, except killing.

1749
02:00:43,490 --> 02:00:45,610
I'm just trying to restore balance.

1750
02:00:45,870 --> 02:00:47,090
Isn't that so wrong?

1751
02:00:47,670 --> 02:00:50,150
If you wish to abandon this creature, we will leave.

1752
02:00:50,730 --> 02:00:51,210
Well, no.

1753
02:00:51,490 --> 02:00:52,870
I don't want to abandon it.

1754
02:00:53,730 --> 02:00:56,430
But if we have to kill a bunch of Dark Elves to get there...

1755
02:00:56,430 --> 02:00:59,210
I remember a young Lodge whom until this very moment...

1756
02:00:59,210 --> 02:00:59,790
A trolley problem.

1757
02:01:00,110 --> 02:01:02,270
But an army of Draugr to save a wounded animal.

1758
02:01:02,470 --> 02:01:02,650
Yeah.

1759
02:01:02,830 --> 02:01:04,150
But these aren't undead Draugr.

1760
02:01:04,750 --> 02:01:05,310
They're elves.

1761
02:01:06,170 --> 02:01:06,650
Makes...

1762
02:01:06,650 --> 02:01:07,310
What's different?

1763
02:01:07,510 --> 02:01:09,030
We're not repeating the same mistakes.

1764
02:01:09,850 --> 02:01:11,190
Getting involved where we shouldn't.

1765
02:01:17,570 --> 02:01:18,410
It's fine.

1766
02:01:18,950 --> 02:01:20,190
It's fine, boy.

1767
02:01:21,750 --> 02:01:23,530
Animals are more important, right?

1768
02:01:24,490 --> 02:01:26,110
Isn't that your motto?

1769
02:01:29,460 --> 02:01:31,920
I thought that was your whole thing, boy.

1770
02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:38,720
Was it not?

1771
02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:43,600
Yeah.

1772
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:44,320
Yeah.

1773
02:01:45,720 --> 02:01:47,160
Which way do I go now?

1774
02:01:47,400 --> 02:01:47,900
Oh, it's here.

1775
02:01:48,580 --> 02:01:49,820
It was just a secret chest.

1776
02:01:51,720 --> 02:01:54,580
But he only loves them and a certain amount, guys.

1777
02:01:55,160 --> 02:01:56,840
He never crosses that path.

1778
02:01:57,380 --> 02:01:57,700
Okay?

1779
02:01:58,600 --> 02:01:59,640
My boy will never.

1780
02:02:00,580 --> 02:02:02,980
I did not raise no, not that type of person.

1781
02:02:07,190 --> 02:02:07,870
He will never.

1782
02:02:10,130 --> 02:02:10,690
There it is.

1783
02:02:13,230 --> 02:02:15,350
I'm gonna be a sick-ass throw if it works.

1784
02:02:16,550 --> 02:02:17,030
Okay.

1785
02:02:18,090 --> 02:02:21,120
Okay, definitely not here.

1786
02:02:27,720 --> 02:02:29,780
Oh, no.

1787
02:02:32,080 --> 02:02:32,700
Oh, no.

1788
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:33,780
What would I do?

1789
02:02:38,080 --> 02:02:40,260
Alright, I'll just slowly walk backwards.

1790
02:02:45,060 --> 02:02:46,680
That's not it?

1791
02:02:50,470 --> 02:02:52,130
No, not from here.

1792
02:02:56,050 --> 02:02:57,850
And where from?

1793
02:02:59,550 --> 02:03:00,230
Oh, there.

1794
02:03:00,650 --> 02:03:01,210
From here.

1795
02:03:04,370 --> 02:03:06,250
I'd rather bang on.

1796
02:03:06,710 --> 02:03:08,530
Gus, thank you for the super chat.

1797
02:03:08,610 --> 02:03:09,450
Thank you.

1798
02:03:13,030 --> 02:03:13,670
Yeah.

1799
02:03:14,290 --> 02:03:16,050
Not in this room, boy.

1800
02:03:19,490 --> 02:03:21,470
Where am I supposed to hit this?

1801
02:03:25,330 --> 02:03:26,090
Maybe there?

1802
02:03:26,190 --> 02:03:27,470
Oh, it has to be this way.

1803
02:03:27,890 --> 02:03:28,830
A lot of you think of this.

1804
02:03:28,910 --> 02:03:29,250
You appreciate it.

1805
02:03:29,670 --> 02:03:30,150
Thank you.

1806
02:03:35,950 --> 02:03:36,870
You're like...

1807
02:03:36,870 --> 02:03:38,370
Yeah, from...

1808
02:03:38,370 --> 02:03:39,490
Oh, not from here.

1809
02:03:40,430 --> 02:03:41,890
Ooh, definitely not from here.

1810
02:03:42,050 --> 02:03:43,190
I can't reach that shit.

1811
02:03:49,810 --> 02:03:52,590
Where the fuck were you supposed to hit then?

1812
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:57,460
Okay.

02:03:57,480 --> 02:04:05,060

Why is...

1827
02:05:24,710 --> 02:05:29,210
Why is Kratos, like, wanna help wanna help up this guy now?

1828
02:05:30,570 --> 02:05:32,130
He usually doesn't care.

1829
02:05:36,330 --> 02:05:39,350
Hey, he didn't care about the fucking baby bears!

1830
02:05:40,670 --> 02:05:42,630
How come he gets to pick and choose?

1831
02:05:45,870 --> 02:05:47,170
Yeah, I never forget.

1832
02:05:49,230 --> 02:05:50,170
I never forget.

1833
02:05:53,710 --> 02:05:57,270
Oh shit, I'm a little fucked up from that.

1834
02:05:57,830 --> 02:05:58,170
Hello?

1835
02:06:00,430 --> 02:06:02,210
Oh my god, I'm so fucked up.

1836
02:06:05,510 --> 02:06:08,390
Yeah, those baby bears were so cute.

1837
02:06:08,770 --> 02:06:12,190
Oh That's what that's where they're coming from

1838
02:06:17,270 --> 02:06:23,210
Well now he wants father-son bonding time this entire day is
father-son bonding time.

1839
02:06:23,710 --> 02:06:26,410
He's just trying to accept his furry side

1840
02:06:31,070 --> 02:06:33,370
He's like son I accept you

1841
02:06:42,240 --> 02:06:43,200
And what?

1842
02:06:44,140 --> 02:06:44,880
What is it?

1843
02:06:45,400 --> 02:06:45,920
Whoa!

1844
02:06:46,760 --> 02:06:48,040
It's a jellyfish!

1845
02:06:50,500 --> 02:06:51,980
It's not just in pain.

1846
02:06:52,500 --> 02:06:53,820
It's trying to sing.

1847
02:06:53,900 --> 02:06:54,760
Oh, it's a jellyfish.

1848
02:06:55,200 --> 02:06:55,980
It's the song of the sands.

1849
02:06:56,400 --> 02:06:58,340
You don't normally sing like this underground.

1850
02:06:59,480 --> 02:07:00,640
Is that what's causing the storm?

1851
02:07:01,180 --> 02:07:06,380
I, judging by all this hive matter weighing it down, it's
been trapped here for dozens of winters.

1852
02:07:07,840 --> 02:07:08,700
Don't worry, Lund.

1853
02:07:09,040 --> 02:07:09,860
We'll get you out.

1854
02:07:11,840 --> 02:07:13,340
What is that name?

1855
02:07:13,740 --> 02:07:17,280
Well, the last good thing you saw was Diner, so...

1856
02:07:17,280 --> 02:07:17,840
Oh, boy.

1857
02:07:18,540 --> 02:07:20,340
Well, I appreciate the attempt at humor.

1858
02:07:20,420 --> 02:07:20,760
Ha-ha!

1859
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,820
That little brother is truly awful, won't play.

1860
02:07:24,720 --> 02:07:25,480
Embarrassing, really.

1861
02:07:26,140 --> 02:07:28,420
Oh, well, can't all be winners.

1862
02:07:31,220 --> 02:07:31,500
Huh?

1863
02:07:31,820 --> 02:07:32,020
What?

1864
02:07:35,240 --> 02:07:36,800
There has to be a way to get...

1865
02:07:36,800 --> 02:07:39,880
Okay, so I actually have to go down, I think?

1866
02:07:40,200 --> 02:07:41,500
There's gotta be a way to clear the...

1867
02:07:42,220 --> 02:07:43,280
Get a better angle.

1868
02:07:43,860 --> 02:07:45,300
I'm trying, boy.

1869
02:07:49,790 --> 02:07:50,390
What better...

1870
02:07:50,390 --> 02:07:51,170
Oh, there it is.

1871
02:07:51,650 --> 02:07:55,290
I'll say, what better angle can I get?

1872
02:08:02,030 --> 02:08:02,670
Oh, nice.

1873
02:08:02,770 --> 02:08:03,610
I got a better angle.

1874
02:08:05,070 --> 02:08:08,050
Gosh, I did it.

1875
02:08:08,130 --> 02:08:08,950
I got a better angle.

1876
02:08:10,630 --> 02:08:11,210
There we go.

1877
02:08:12,110 --> 02:08:13,750
Yeah, you're free now!

1878
02:08:14,330 --> 02:08:15,630
But it still can't get out.

1879
02:08:15,930 --> 02:08:16,410

of alpine's natural resources i think you just got caught up

02:09:52,480 --> 02:09:56,260
Okay, but where... what the fuck was the fucking thing?

1891
02:09:57,720 --> 02:10:00,480
Easeous trolley problem of my life.

1892
02:10:07,220 --> 02:10:08,560
I remember it was like, slow down.

1893
02:10:08,740 --> 02:10:09,620
I forgot to slow down.

1894
02:10:13,200 --> 02:10:14,640
That's the pause.

1895
02:10:17,680 --> 02:10:18,580
This is the spot.

1896
02:10:18,980 --> 02:10:21,380
We can cut the half-goof and lose here.

1897
02:10:23,380 --> 02:10:24,640
Oh, circle.

1898
02:10:24,880 --> 02:10:25,780
It's a cutscene cut.

1899
02:10:28,800 --> 02:10:30,360
Ah, Zona, thank you for the super chat.

1900
02:10:30,460 --> 02:10:31,140
Thank you, thank you.

1901
02:10:31,280 --> 02:10:32,680

02:10:32,840 --> 02:10:34,300
Thanks for making me laugh like you did.

1903
02:10:34,420 --> 02:10:36,600

02:10:50,340 --> 02:10:51,600
Yeah, it's fine.

1910
02:10:52,160 --> 02:10:53,920
It's okay if a couple of dark elves died.

1911
02:10:54,360 --> 02:10:55,340
The storm's gone.

1912
02:10:55,980 --> 02:10:57,260
You don't have to do this kind of stuff.

games.

1920
02:12:02,280 --> 02:12:02,820
Okay.

1921
02:12:03,600 --> 02:12:04,600
Wait, he's still there?

1922
02:12:05,020 --> 02:12:06,620
Hello, jellyfish.

1923
02:12:08,540 --> 02:12:09,340
Hello.

1924
02:12:10,240 --> 02:12:11,380
Oh, he's just floating.

1925
02:12:13,560 --> 02:12:13,820
Finally.

1926
02:12:18,950 --> 02:12:20,010
Where is he going?

1927
02:12:22,610 --> 02:12:23,150
Bye.

1928
02:12:25,950 --> 02:12:28,030
A cheaper than therapy.

1929
02:12:29,030 --> 02:12:31,630
It's like, so that's how it feels.

1930
02:12:32,650 --> 02:12:33,150
Oh, it is.

1931
02:12:33,170 --> 02:12:35,970
I've got to remember to ask here about his travels to the
lands beyond the seas.

1932
02:12:36,750 --> 02:12:37,930
You wish to travel the world?

1933
02:12:38,590 --> 02:12:39,130
I don't know.

1934
02:12:39,830 --> 02:12:40,150
Maybe.

1935
02:12:40,890 --> 02:12:41,790
See new places.

1936
02:12:42,590 --> 02:12:44,550
Find out more about myself.

1937
02:12:44,550 --> 02:12:45,330
Is he going anywhere?

1938
02:12:45,470 --> 02:12:46,850
He's just vibing.

1939
02:12:48,130 --> 02:12:49,530
Is the little guy just vibing?

1940
02:12:51,870 --> 02:12:53,730
I guess he's just, he lives here now.

1941
02:12:58,190 --> 02:12:59,550
I don't understand.

1942
02:13:00,470 --> 02:13:00,910
I...

1943
02:13:01,070 --> 02:13:02,670
I don't understand.

1944
02:13:02,950 --> 02:13:03,410
Okay, there you go.

1945
02:13:03,550 --> 02:13:04,530
Yeah, I'm close enough.

1946
02:13:05,410 --> 02:13:08,330
I was gonna say, why is it not long enough?

1947
02:13:12,300 --> 02:13:12,620
Okay.

1948
02:13:14,020 --> 02:13:14,820
There you go.

1949
02:13:16,620 --> 02:13:17,620
Where's the last one?

1950
02:13:22,280 --> 02:13:23,700
It's above average.

1951
02:13:27,520 --> 02:13:31,340
I asked my wife that every day.

1952
02:13:34,960 --> 02:13:36,860
Guys, it's above average.

1953
02:13:38,360 --> 02:13:40,020
That's what my wife tells me.

1954
02:13:43,080 --> 02:13:44,380
There's the last one.

1955
02:13:46,740 --> 02:13:47,980
Okay, come on.

1956
02:13:48,040 --> 02:13:48,880
It had a glowing.

1957
02:13:53,030 --> 02:13:55,010
Where the fuck is the last one?

1958
02:13:58,250 --> 02:13:59,970
It's just very cold.

1959
02:14:04,390 --> 02:14:06,990
Where is the fucking last one?

1960
02:14:07,390 --> 02:14:08,150
What the hell?

1961
02:14:12,170 --> 02:14:23,230

1963
02:14:37,490 --> 02:14:38,730

02:14:40,310 --> 02:14:41,430
Oh, Shemriya.

1965
02:14:41,550 --> 02:14:43,350
Oh, Chokey, they can fly.

1966
02:14:43,470 --> 02:14:44,970
Soldiers be fought in Svartalfi.

1967

And help?

1968
02:14:46,790 --> 02:14:47,130

Yeah.

1970
02:14:48,410 --> 02:14:50,690
Spirits in Baha'u'llah until Ragnarok comes.

1971
02:14:50,970 --> 02:14:52,310
They were no spirits.

1972
02:14:53,650 --> 02:14:55,870
Oh, those Doki are fucking elves.

1973
02:14:56,510 --> 02:14:59,150
Activated his force as early as a standing army.

1974
02:14:59,950 --> 02:15:02,070
Perhaps something you could only do without any honor.

1975
02:15:02,090 --> 02:15:04,170
honest valkyries around to stand in his way

1976
02:15:07,430 --> 02:15:16,850

1979
02:15:40,670 --> 02:15:42,530
There's a lot, but you come here later.

1980
02:15:42,770 --> 02:15:43,010
All right.

1981
02:15:43,890 --> 02:15:46,170
I'm in there's like open world L-time now.

1982
02:15:47,270 --> 02:15:48,070
Oh, shit.

1983
02:15:48,190 --> 02:15:48,770
Where's my HP?

1984
02:15:49,050 --> 02:15:49,850
Oh, no, that's bad.

1985
02:15:50,290 --> 02:15:50,790
This is bad.

1986
02:15:50,890 --> 02:15:52,350
I didn't even realize my HP was that bad.

1987
02:15:53,250 --> 02:15:53,830
Oh, my God.

1988
02:15:54,050 --> 02:15:57,090
Fucking course, there's the exploding goddamn salamanders
that's going in.

1989
02:15:58,170 --> 02:16:00,730
Okay, I should have to do this for the heals.

1990
02:16:02,270 --> 02:16:04,710
I gotta beat them up for some extra HP.

1991
02:16:08,910 --> 02:16:09,610
That's fine.

1992
02:16:11,450 --> 02:16:11,950
Oh shit.

1993
02:16:12,710 --> 02:16:13,050
Not fine.

1994
02:16:13,230 --> 02:16:13,890
Not fine.

1995
02:16:14,250 --> 02:16:14,590
Grab me!

1996
02:16:16,750 --> 02:16:17,830
Alright, I gotta grab this.

1997
02:16:18,010 --> 02:16:19,230
Oh wait, that's just regular loot.

1998
02:16:19,330 --> 02:16:20,150
I thought that was HP.

1999
02:16:23,810 --> 02:16:25,210
Oh my god, this is bad.

2000
02:16:25,350 --> 02:16:25,870
This is bad!

2001
02:16:27,150 --> 02:16:31,430
Oh my god, it's like me going invading your home was not a
good idea guys.

2002
02:16:32,090 --> 02:16:33,170
Who would have thought?

2003
02:16:36,450 --> 02:16:38,810
Are you fucking kidding me?

2004
02:16:39,010 --> 02:16:40,170

2005
02:16:43,130 --> 02:16:44,630

02:16:47,330 --> 02:16:48,010
That's five.

2007
02:16:50,170 --> 02:16:52,930
All right, that means I can kill him.

2008
02:16:53,130 --> 02:16:55,850
All right,

2009
02:16:58,870 --> 02:16:59,390
let's get him.

2010
02:17:00,170 --> 02:17:02,270
Oh my god, he baited me.

2011
02:17:03,070 --> 02:17:03,750

I did free the jellyfish, though.

2016
02:17:37,910 --> 02:17:38,470
You're right.

2017
02:17:41,670 --> 02:17:45,070
Look, I'm making sure there's no invasive species here.

2018
02:17:45,950 --> 02:17:47,630
Who knows if this is their actual home?

2019
02:17:47,930 --> 02:17:48,170
You know?

2020
02:17:48,630 --> 02:17:50,890
What if this is the iguana situation, as always?

2021
02:17:52,610 --> 02:17:54,070
Oh, wait, that's Astro!

2022
02:17:54,210 --> 02:17:54,450
Wait!

2023
02:17:55,450 --> 02:17:55,690
Wait!

2024
02:17:58,910 --> 02:18:00,650
Was that Astro Boy?

2025
02:18:01,730 --> 02:18:02,830
We're not Astro...

2026
02:18:02,830 --> 02:18:04,430
Astro... not Astro Boy Astro...

2027
02:18:06,050 --> 02:18:07,210

02:18:07,210 --> 02:18:08,190
You know what I mean?

2029
02:18:08,630 --> 02:18:10,490
Not Astro Boy.

2030
02:18:11,730 --> 02:18:13,730
Yeah, the cover here.

2031
02:18:13,850 --> 02:18:15,610
Yes, Astro Boy.

2032
02:18:19,630 --> 02:18:20,350
Astro Boy.

2033
02:18:20,350 --> 02:18:20,870
Astro Boy.

2034
02:18:26,760 --> 02:18:27,760
Now what?

2035
02:18:28,220 --> 02:18:29,460
My face is itchy.

2036
02:18:30,240 --> 02:18:31,460
I think my beard's coming in.

2037
02:18:31,900 --> 02:18:32,680
Is it?

2038
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:33,320
Yeah.

2039
02:18:33,760 --> 02:18:34,520
On my jawline.

2040
02:18:34,680 --> 02:18:34,860
See?

2041
02:18:35,380 --> 02:18:35,880
It's growing.

2042
02:18:36,680 --> 02:18:37,380
All right, let's go.

2043
02:18:37,560 --> 02:18:37,820
Is it?

2044
02:18:37,820 --> 02:18:38,600
We go home.

2045
02:18:38,780 --> 02:18:39,920
Last note, just adopt.

2046
02:18:40,360 --> 02:18:41,160
It's not dirt.

2047
02:18:41,780 --> 02:18:42,660
Are you sure, boy?

2048
02:18:43,320 --> 02:18:45,420
Wait, there might be a little over here.

2049
02:18:45,660 --> 02:18:46,480
What is it?

2050
02:18:48,240 --> 02:18:49,500
Wait, there could be a little here.

2051
02:18:51,260 --> 02:18:52,540
Let me double check, boy.

2052
02:18:54,880 --> 02:18:55,340
Oh, shit.

2053
02:18:55,420 --> 02:18:56,400
It's just something dark out.

2054
02:18:57,240 --> 02:18:57,760
All right.

2055
02:18:58,620 --> 02:18:59,240
All right.

2056
02:19:00,160 --> 02:19:00,720
Oh, yeah.

2057
02:19:00,980 --> 02:19:01,460
It's coming.

2058
02:19:01,720 --> 02:19:03,340
Okay, you can help me though, right?

2059
02:19:04,900 --> 02:19:06,760
Alright, yeah, look!

2060
02:19:09,600 --> 02:19:11,100
Oh shit, no, it's the Lord.

2061
02:19:12,180 --> 02:19:13,840
It's the Lord, man.

2062
02:19:15,740 --> 02:19:17,640
Oh my god, are you fucking kidding me?

2063
02:19:17,820 --> 02:19:18,060
What?

2064
02:19:18,980 --> 02:19:22,620
Okay, that should have been a... that should have been a
parry though.

2065
02:19:28,020 --> 02:19:28,480
There we go.

2066
02:19:29,460 --> 02:19:31,200
That's fucking right, that parry was sick!

2067
02:19:36,540 --> 02:19:38,610
Oh shit, okay, I thought I could...

2068
02:19:39,320 --> 02:19:40,540
Alright, it's fine, it's fine.

2069
02:19:42,140 --> 02:19:48,980
I'll do this, and then grab that, and grab this, and then
grab this, and it's rage time!

Oh, and I get to read.

2077
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:17,780
It is healthy if I can't afford it.

2078
02:20:18,620 --> 02:20:21,700
It's the healthiest thing I can afford, okay, guys?

2079
02:20:25,340 --> 02:20:26,440
These are my therapists.

2080
02:20:26,800 --> 02:20:28,060
I'm unstable and emotional.

2081
02:20:28,620 --> 02:20:30,500
And that's why I don't see her no more.

2082

02:21:39,490 --> 02:21:39,770
Nice.

2099
02:21:39,890 --> 02:21:40,070
Alright.

2100
02:21:41,410 --> 02:21:43,270
Okay, we gotta progress the plot.

2101
02:21:43,550 --> 02:21:44,830
This is a very long game.

2102
02:21:45,210 --> 02:21:46,910
Okay, now, now, now we go.

2103
02:21:47,350 --> 02:21:48,410
Now we go.

2104
02:21:49,590 --> 02:21:51,550
Now we go and progress the plot.

2105
02:21:53,310 --> 02:21:55,490
Oh my god, it sounds not okay there.

2106
02:21:55,610 --> 02:21:56,510
Oh my god, there's more loot.

2107
02:21:57,730 --> 02:21:58,630
I'm okay now.

2108
02:21:58,690 --> 02:22:00,630
It is you who builds it with skill.

2109
02:22:01,190 --> 02:22:02,930
Okay, now we progress the plot.

2110
02:22:04,630 --> 02:22:06,010
No more goofing around.

2111
02:22:07,150 --> 02:22:08,890
Well, I follow the yellow marker.

2112
02:22:12,250 --> 02:22:13,230
All right, here we go.

2113
02:22:17,490 --> 02:22:22,730
Atreus, I've been considering your question about whether
grower's deception made a difference.

2114
02:22:23,750 --> 02:22:24,830
I think of it this way.

2115
02:22:25,890 --> 02:22:29,630
When it comes to subverting prophecy, knowledge is power.

2116
02:22:30,030 --> 02:22:33,070
Because that means we don't have to leave mid-guide.

2117
02:22:33,290 --> 02:22:36,290
The finer details can lead you to tragically incorrect
interpretations.

2118
02:22:37,410 --> 02:22:44,070
Back in my homeland, I was privy to the operations of a
certain coven of heat witches who were keen on destabilizing

2119
02:22:44,070 --> 02:22:44,610
the government.

2120
02:22:46,190 --> 02:22:54,690
destabilizing the government and otherwise loyal man and fed
him a story of his own ascension to king let this wait stay

2121
02:22:54,690 --> 02:23:04,390
alert and you see siya is reacting to your reaction of the
dead poet reveal it's pretty funny to see you ask why he

2122
02:23:04,390 --> 02:23:13,630
didn't sound like ryan reynolds i don't even remember what i
said that game awards was like a fucking uh like it was a

2123
02:23:13,630 --> 02:23:22,150

Yeah, technically it's coming out like Uh, what is this?

2129
02:24:06,310 --> 02:24:16,110
The Immersion for a short duration The Immersion Rage and a
Bligh Stun to Nearby Enemies What do I want?

2130
02:24:16,150 --> 02:24:17,030
Which one's better?

2131
02:24:17,970 --> 02:24:19,370
Main or Ram?

2132
02:24:24,040 --> 02:24:30,240
But they like haven't said anything About it, so I'm like
confused Is it actually going to come out?

2133
02:24:31,180 --> 02:24:38,240
Like, I've heard nothing about the game since the Game
Awards announced it.

2134
02:24:39,880 --> 02:24:40,940
Which one's better, guys?

2135
02:24:41,100 --> 02:24:41,780
Mane or Graham?

2136
02:24:43,500 --> 02:24:44,860
I just think that's weird.

2137
02:24:45,780 --> 02:24:49,440
Like, are we going to get the game?

2138
02:24:49,800 --> 02:24:52,400
Like, are we going to get the game?

2139
02:24:52,660 --> 02:24:54,040
There's no trailer.

2140
02:24:54,700 --> 02:24:55,780
There's no nothing.

2141
02:24:55,960 --> 02:24:57,440
Nothing hyping it up.

2142
02:24:57,660 --> 02:25:00,260
I want to see the gameplay.

2143
02:25:07,080 --> 02:25:09,200
Gram is useful, but later.

2144
02:25:09,760 --> 02:25:10,780
So should I just upgrade?

2145
02:25:10,880 --> 02:25:11,960
I'll just try it.

2146
02:25:12,040 --> 02:25:12,700
Which one should I?

2147
02:25:15,620 --> 02:25:16,700
I like Gram.

2148
02:25:16,920 --> 02:25:18,240
All right, we'll grab Gram then.

2149
02:25:18,360 --> 02:25:19,160
And we'll upgrade it.

2150
02:25:20,520 --> 02:25:22,700
I'll upgrade Spider-Rage, too.

2151
02:25:22,960 --> 02:25:23,880
I'm going to upgrade all of it.

2152
02:25:24,080 --> 02:25:24,600
Oh, never mind.

2153
02:25:25,920 --> 02:25:26,780
Main for now?

2154
02:25:26,920 --> 02:25:27,500
Fuck, okay.

2155
02:25:27,920 --> 02:25:29,780
Then I'll upgrade this then.

2156
02:25:30,960 --> 02:25:31,380
All right.

2157
02:25:31,440 --> 02:25:34,340
I mean, I've fucking already upgraded a lot of my stuff so

2158
02:25:40,250 --> 02:25:49,590
yeah I think I did I not yeah no I wanted you guys said
later for grab

2159
02:25:54,050 --> 02:26:02,150
I still want to try it out even if it's dead on arrival like
I've made a tweet about it but I just think shooters in

2160
02:26:02,150 --> 02:26:08,890
general is just a dying genre right now like the only thing
game people are playing like we heard like apparently Call

2161
02:26:08,890 --> 02:26:18,610
of Duty is not doing so well now and not a lot of people
play battlefield too and and um i think like shooters is

2162
02:26:18,610 --> 02:26:28,990
just a dying genre in itself so there's not there hasn't
been a lot of like uh it has been a lot of like shooter

2163
02:26:28,990 --> 02:26:33,790
games that are releasing i guess like the only ones that
people are talking about are creators but it just hasn't

2164
02:26:33,790 --> 02:26:44,970
clicked for me i'm so because i guess like i've never been
an So, it's like, I haven't had art readers just click for

2165
02:26:44,970 --> 02:26:45,070
me.

2166
02:26:45,150 --> 02:26:48,110
I was playing with, like, some friends for art creators.

2167
02:26:51,390 --> 02:26:52,350
Just to...

2168
02:26:52,350 --> 02:26:54,850
Okay, we want to go to Sindri's, yeah.

2169
02:26:55,550 --> 02:26:58,570
And, like, I was just so bored.

2170
02:27:01,910 --> 02:27:03,730
I was honestly for me, it was just...

2171
02:27:03,730 --> 02:27:05,910
I was just bored because it's like...

2172
02:27:06,910 --> 02:27:15,230
It's like, yeah, you can play peaceful mode or you can play
like pvp mode but i i just don't think for me i just i just

2173
02:27:15,230 --> 02:27:25,750
hate i just hate that you lose everything too um quite sure
what the giants meant by any of it i i just hate like the

2174
02:27:25,750 --> 02:27:32,310
fact that there's a risk of losing everything and then and
then obviously the person who's more geared is gonna win

2175
02:27:32,310 --> 02:27:44,130
most likely win the fight too and you do want to go into the
fights and then peaceful mode gets tiring after a while too

2176
02:27:44,130 --> 02:27:59,630
yeah so for me it's just i just it's not for me speak with
you oh okay i forgot about that he existed yeah and in

2177
02:27:59,630 --> 02:28:11,450
peaceful mode like it gets tiring after a while i also need
a pee real quick i'll be right back

2178
02:30:32,300 --> 02:30:51,600
back i'm back uh uh nexi allen bite solid wb for rice jay
lecon mike star uh tom uh caguya captain x factor uh papa

2179
02:30:51,600 --> 02:30:58,080
thank you for the super chat thank you thank you i'll talk
more about later i had like a literal identity crisis this

2180
02:30:58,080 --> 02:31:02,140
morning because i was like or not this morning i'm not that
i don't wake up that early i

2181
02:31:05,280 --> 02:31:06,300
Who am I kidding?

2182
02:31:06,520 --> 02:31:07,640
What do you mean morning, Doki?

2183
02:31:08,040 --> 02:31:09,300
This afternoon.

2184
02:31:11,720 --> 02:31:13,000
That ain't me.

2185
02:31:15,800 --> 02:31:17,560
Anyway, I had like an identity crisis.

2186
02:31:17,580 --> 02:31:18,640
I'll talk more about it later.

2187
02:31:19,140 --> 02:31:21,140
But I had identity crisis this afternoon.

2188
02:31:22,380 --> 02:31:25,900
Because like, imagine I were talking being like, because
like, yeah, shooter.

2189
02:31:26,060 --> 02:31:27,620
Because like, you know, I'm good aim.

2190
02:31:27,740 --> 02:31:28,620
I'm good reflexes.

2191
02:31:28,900 --> 02:31:32,780
So it makes more sense if I like, you know, play more around
my niche and everything.

2192
02:31:32,880 --> 02:31:39,740
Because I felt like I was like, Back when I was in a
company, like for ENV tubers, I was like, like, I guess like

2193
02:31:39,740 --> 02:31:49,040
one of the first ENV tubers in a corpo that played like, um,
played like shooters at a high, high for English side off,

2194
02:31:49,100 --> 02:31:50,620
like obviously at a high level.

2195
02:31:51,820 --> 02:31:55,820
And so like that was a niche I established for myself back
then.

2196
02:31:56,340 --> 02:32:03,620
And then obviously I've been like straying away from it
because it's just as like like over the last like year or

2197
02:32:03,620 --> 02:32:14,460
two i've been slowly straying away from that i mean i still
do the rivals ring thing but um but it's like it's like um

2198
02:32:14,460 --> 02:32:22,020
there just hasn't been a lot of good shooter games coming
out recently and it's like so hard because like i don't want

2199
02:32:22,020 --> 02:32:28,800
to force my like i don't want to like um you know like force
myself to play valorant or because i'm sorry but

2200
02:32:33,100 --> 02:32:37,900
I feel like if I commit to it, I can get a high rank in
Valorant, I think.

2201
02:32:38,420 --> 02:32:41,520
If I commit to it, it's just more so if I like the game or
not.

2202
02:32:43,720 --> 02:32:45,880
Because if I like a game, I will get a high rank.

2203
02:32:45,880 --> 02:32:48,240
I will get a high rank on it.

2204
02:32:48,360 --> 02:32:49,560
It's like how, yeah.

2205
02:32:50,780 --> 02:32:53,080
Yeah, or it's like, what else?

2206
02:32:53,340 --> 02:32:53,620
What else?

2207
02:32:54,100 --> 02:32:57,900
And it's like, but like there's not, hasn't been in the
past.

2208
02:32:58,060 --> 02:33:03,900
We would get, like, I think when I was like in the company,
lot of shooter games because when we were in when we were in

2209
02:33:03,900 --> 02:33:14,060
the company we had um we had so many shooter games coming
out like always so it was like so easy and then like you

2210
02:33:14,060 --> 02:33:24,220
know apex was like super popular too so i could easily just
uh hop on to apex um if i wanted to i think apex is like one

2211
02:33:24,220 --> 02:33:32,900
of the easiest shooter collab games you can do for rivals
it's not the same it's not the same at the perfect balance

2212
02:33:32,900 --> 02:33:38,800
um where like there's downtime where you can have
conversations and then there's intense fight moments but

2213
02:33:38,800 --> 02:33:45,760
like if you look at rivals you look at overwatch you look at
valorant there's never really downtime there's more so it's

2214
02:33:45,760 --> 02:33:54,460
just always like you know you're just playing the game
you're just really just you're just playing yeah and then i

2215
02:33:54,460 --> 02:34:02,400
guess you have arc raiders where there is downtime but it's
an extraction shooter so like i've just i've never vibed

2216
02:34:02,400 --> 02:34:11,040
with extraction shooters because i just hate losing loot
because it's like yeah because i it makes me play more

2217
02:34:11,040 --> 02:34:20,640
carefully too because when i have good loot um i just like i
have to play super careful and then i have to like you know

2218
02:34:20,640 --> 02:34:28,580
um make sure like the fight is in my on my side as well and
in the fucking pve aspect because like that's a

2219
02:34:33,560 --> 02:34:46,300
like yeah the gear fear i can't i can't get rid of gear fear
i'm a loot goblin i've always been a loot goblin like what

2220
02:34:46,300 --> 02:34:59,100
about fortnite people are fucking pussies in fortnite yeah
the wild card i can't fucking oh man yeah the goddamn wild

2221
02:34:59,100 --> 02:35:12,240
card with the goddamn arc raiders and arc the arcs and the
raiders yeah and fortnite is super casual too yeah so i i've

2222
02:35:12,240 --> 02:35:19,760
been i was having an actual identity crisis with my manager
um this afternoon because i was like because i i don't know

2223
02:35:19,760 --> 02:35:26,360
maybe we can check out some older shooter games because like
um like the only shooter game i can think of to look forward

2224
02:35:26,360 --> 02:35:27,960
to too um

2225
02:35:31,620 --> 02:35:39,320
it's literally high guard that's coming out that's really
the only shooter i can think about that's coming out it's

2226
02:35:39,320 --> 02:35:49,140
literally high guard yeah i can't think of any other shooter
games that are coming out like that's good that we have to

2227
02:35:49,140 --> 02:35:58,360
look forward to speak if you are ever in need of my services
and i am not present i have installed these handy chimes for

2228
02:35:58,360 --> 02:36:03,820
you to notify me Simply throw your axe and strike the
chimes, and I will attend to your needs.

2229
02:36:03,840 --> 02:36:08,640
A lot of recent FPS games, even TPS games, haven't been,
like, really great so far.

2230
02:36:10,120 --> 02:36:11,240
I will say.

2231
02:36:13,520 --> 02:36:14,080
Boop.

2232
02:36:14,280 --> 02:36:16,340
A magnificent throw, Master Gives.

2233
02:36:16,780 --> 02:36:18,200
Truly a seasoned pro.

2234
02:36:18,500 --> 02:36:18,860
Yay!

2235
02:36:19,580 --> 02:36:20,920
You know how to reach me now.

2236
02:36:21,560 --> 02:36:23,060
Well, then, what else, friends?

2237
02:36:23,460 --> 02:36:24,060
What else?

2238
02:36:24,180 --> 02:36:24,780
I have a question.

2239
02:36:25,280 --> 02:36:25,840
Splendid!

2240
02:36:26,140 --> 02:36:28,820
I delight in offering my tutelage to the Inquisitive.

2241
02:36:29,280 --> 02:36:31,360
Over the ledge, by the gateway over there.

2242
02:36:32,100 --> 02:36:33,180
I noticed these dragons.

2243
02:36:34,260 --> 02:36:35,820
Oh, no, young master Atreus.

2244
02:36:36,180 --> 02:36:38,840
Those are leaned worms, the brood of Neathogue.

2245
02:36:39,380 --> 02:36:39,880
Neathogue?

2246
02:36:40,420 --> 02:36:41,140
That's the mother?

2247
02:36:41,460 --> 02:36:41,800
Correct.

2248
02:36:42,160 --> 02:36:46,160
She's also a vital piece of the Atrecelian circle of life,
as it were.

2249
02:36:46,680 --> 02:36:51,720
I tend the branches up here, while Neathogue chooses the
roots from below to prevent overgrowth.

2250
02:36:52,140 --> 02:36:53,280
A delicate balance.

2251
02:36:53,720 --> 02:36:54,380
So they're friendly?

2252
02:36:54,760 --> 02:36:59,200
Well, they're not nearly so affable as myself, but there's
no reason to expect hostilities.

2253
02:36:59,280 --> 02:37:00,940
so long as they're left in peace.

2254
02:37:01,620 --> 02:37:07,360
Nithog is a stern matriarch, as protective of her offspring
as she is determined to teach them proper discipline.

2255
02:37:07,920 --> 02:37:09,760
That sounds familiar.

2256
02:37:12,400 --> 02:37:13,760
Until we meet again.

2257
02:37:15,940 --> 02:37:18,080
I am already here.

2258
02:37:18,460 --> 02:37:19,120
Understand the great host.

2259
02:37:19,360 --> 02:37:21,100
For precisely those, though.

2260
02:37:22,500 --> 02:37:24,140
Perhaps there was some confusion.

2261
02:37:24,600 --> 02:37:28,520
This is for calling me out here, not for when I am here.

2262
02:37:29,300 --> 02:37:32,780
Do you just like hearing the sound of the chine?

2263
02:37:33,600 --> 02:37:36,640
I suppose they do sound very pretty.

2264
02:37:38,560 --> 02:37:46,080
Master Kratos, this feels very uncharacteristic of you, but
if you enjoy the pretty chine that much, I will allow you to

2265
02:37:46,080 --> 02:37:46,440
indulge.

2266
02:37:47,600 --> 02:37:49,800
Yes, you've been well-thrown.

2267
02:37:51,160 --> 02:37:58,560
Ah, the sound of the chine is not unmeanful at this
distance, so perhaps you could not?

2268
02:38:01,840 --> 02:38:11,380
already here as it were so i see you're deliberately
attempting to push me into some sort of emotional outburst

2269
02:38:11,380 --> 02:38:23,220
aren't you well i'm not so easily swayed my good man stop
with the stupid child oh dear i'm sorry i don't know

2270
02:38:32,060 --> 02:38:39,720
yay rage bait rage bait successful

2271
02:38:42,960 --> 02:38:56,880
yay won't you oh sure do we need a jingle keys for you thank
you for the super chat thank you thank you glad you're in a

2272
02:38:56,880 --> 02:39:01,020
better mood yes oh my next Mission, eat dinner.

2273
02:39:03,220 --> 02:39:04,820
Oh, he made the table!

2274
02:39:05,560 --> 02:39:06,200
Wait, which one?

2275
02:39:06,240 --> 02:39:08,480
Did he make this one or the other table?

2276
02:39:09,540 --> 02:39:12,280
Wait, I want to sit on the nicer table!

2277
02:39:14,300 --> 02:39:15,360
That's not fair!

2278
02:39:16,060 --> 02:39:18,240
I don't want to eat on the pretty table!

2279
02:39:19,460 --> 02:39:20,360
I never said that.

2280
02:39:20,940 --> 02:39:21,980
You're kind that way.

2281
02:39:23,120 --> 02:39:24,280
But your eyes say everything.

2282
02:39:27,220 --> 02:39:27,800
What's this?

2283
02:39:28,580 --> 02:39:28,960
Eat.

2284
02:39:29,280 --> 02:39:32,780
We were in the souls of Lake and we didn't even grab his
fourth soul.

2285
02:39:32,960 --> 02:39:35,020
Now he's gonna be blue forever.

2286
02:39:35,620 --> 02:39:37,140
Joki, what's wrong with being blue?

2287
02:39:37,360 --> 02:39:38,280
He is blue!

2288
02:39:39,360 --> 02:39:39,960
What do you mean?

2289
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:41,740
What's wrong with being blue?

2290
02:39:41,920 --> 02:39:43,340
He is fucking blue!

2291
02:39:46,200 --> 02:39:48,520
You have to sit at the kid's table now.

2292
02:39:52,550 --> 02:39:53,010
Enjoy.

2293
02:39:54,710 --> 02:39:55,670
Enjoy, my friends.

2294
02:39:56,810 --> 02:39:57,150
Yeah.

2295
02:39:58,750 --> 02:40:00,390
We'll see about that.

2296
02:40:06,880 --> 02:40:07,380
Yeah.

2297
02:40:09,140 --> 02:40:10,340
Here you are.

2298
02:40:11,420 --> 02:40:13,080
A meal fit for a champion.

2299
02:40:14,620 --> 02:40:14,820
Whoa.

2300
02:40:15,240 --> 02:40:16,520
Don't touch my son.

2301
02:40:17,740 --> 02:40:18,040
Yes.

2302
02:40:18,640 --> 02:40:19,040
Of course.

2303
02:40:19,620 --> 02:40:21,000
Oh, because he's the champion.

2304
02:40:21,180 --> 02:40:22,140
He's going to kill Odin.

2305
02:40:23,480 --> 02:40:24,460
I'm not offended.

2306
02:40:25,460 --> 02:40:26,180
It's just a word.

2307
02:40:26,380 --> 02:40:27,800
The word didn't cloud your judgment.

2308
02:40:28,540 --> 02:40:29,940
Yeah, we can't have his ego.

2309
02:40:30,240 --> 02:40:31,740
You really don't think it means anything.

2310
02:40:32,080 --> 02:40:33,320
We can't boost his ego like that.

2311
02:40:33,320 --> 02:40:34,380
We got humble him.

2312
02:40:35,980 --> 02:40:48,590
everything we saw in Yodenheim what was it all for don't you
ever think about that every day purpose was to inspire you

2313
02:40:48,590 --> 02:40:57,190
to take foolishness but what if the Giants are counting on
me what Giants they're all dead boy you don't even press no

2314
02:40:57,190 --> 02:41:12,190
Giants but use the judgment of a man and not of a child but
what if Loki going to ironwood it's the only way that you're

2315
02:41:12,190 --> 02:41:35,580
not special boy he's like you're not special holy that's
fine that's too real oh my god that's too real

2316
02:41:39,100 --> 02:41:48,160
eat oh some people swear by it on almost a daily basis i
just don't understand why is there all this stuff about loki

2317
02:41:48,160 --> 02:41:58,300
and and the champion and iron would have none of it's real
he's just so ah he's gonna get her new bear i got the bear

2318
02:41:58,300 --> 02:41:58,740
in him

2319
02:42:04,040 --> 02:42:08,160
oh no that my racist dwarf is gonna say more bad things to
me

2320
02:42:15,070 --> 02:42:28,790
advice you've heard all day and possibly ever sleep that's
when all the troubles of your mind work themselves out sure

2321
02:42:28,790 --> 02:42:47,940
fine sleep sounds great I mean it I do too get out of here
already already already gone it's nice that we get his on

2322
02:42:47,940 --> 02:42:48,560
stuff.

2323
02:42:49,460 --> 02:42:51,780
I think the last game was mostly focused on Kratos.

2324
02:42:52,480 --> 02:42:55,100
But now we get to see like Arteus too.

2325
02:42:56,040 --> 02:42:57,480
We get to learn more about him.

2326
02:42:58,560 --> 02:43:00,560
It's in like a punk ass bitch no more.

2327
02:43:13,540 --> 02:43:15,660
He is too young to have opinions.

2328
02:43:17,520 --> 02:43:20,160
To have his free will.

2329
02:43:23,800 --> 02:43:25,540
Why is he lying on his bow?

2330
02:43:26,080 --> 02:43:27,120
He's gotta be protected.

2331
02:43:27,300 --> 02:43:27,440
Oh!

2332
02:43:28,180 --> 02:43:29,200
Young woman.

2333
02:43:29,720 --> 02:43:30,240
Oh no.

2334
02:43:30,600 --> 02:43:34,180
Okay, I was gonna be like, oh no, is it those types of
dreams?

2335
02:43:40,400 --> 02:43:41,780
That's why it's iron.

2336
02:43:43,500 --> 02:43:44,300
I'm sorry.

2337
02:43:44,740 --> 02:43:45,720
I'm 13.

2338
02:43:55,680 --> 02:43:59,400
My humor is that of a 13-year-old boy.

2339
02:43:59,960 --> 02:44:00,540
Oh, hey.

2340
02:44:00,940 --> 02:44:01,660
Oh, that's me.

2341
02:44:02,200 --> 02:44:04,360
That's me when God of War 1.

2342
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:05,500
Or not 1.

2343
02:44:05,740 --> 02:44:07,380
In the last God of War.

2344
02:44:08,980 --> 02:44:21,620
got an elf on I wouldn't have felt so bad about killing so
many elves what's going on what is going on that a mask I

My angst, please.

2352
02:45:14,740 --> 02:45:15,220
Whatever.

2353
02:45:25,040 --> 02:45:27,300
I'm going to hit my goth face now.

2354
02:45:27,380 --> 02:45:28,200
My emo face.

2355
02:45:28,400 --> 02:45:29,080
I got to get out of here.

2356
02:45:33,510 --> 02:45:34,950
First she came from you.

2357
02:45:35,090 --> 02:45:35,790
And so I said nothing.

2358
02:45:35,990 --> 02:45:37,850
Then she came for Smurrs.

2359
02:45:38,230 --> 02:45:38,910
Papa Smurr.

2360
02:45:39,030 --> 02:45:40,250
Thank you for the super chat.

2361
02:45:40,270 --> 02:45:40,570
Thank you.

2362
02:45:40,870 --> 02:45:41,250
Thank you.

2363
02:45:48,050 --> 02:45:49,250
The cave.

2364
02:45:50,710 --> 02:45:50,790
The cave?

2365
02:45:50,790 --> 02:45:52,590
He should pay for what he said about mother.

2366
02:45:58,350 --> 02:45:59,390
But we're gods.

2367
02:46:01,130 --> 02:46:04,470
We can do whatever we want.

2368
02:46:04,970 --> 02:46:06,410
Well, his first kill.

2369
02:46:08,190 --> 02:46:09,750
Oh, shit!

2370
02:46:12,770 --> 02:46:16,310
Bro, when you get stabbed in a dream, you get stabbed in
real life.

2371
02:46:18,250 --> 02:46:19,810
Or is this just London?

2372
02:46:20,410 --> 02:46:21,970
This is a much better knife than mothers.

2373
02:46:22,810 --> 02:46:23,550
Please, stop!

2374
02:46:54,660 --> 02:46:55,740
Where am I?

2375
02:46:55,940 --> 02:46:56,840
Yeah, where is he?

2376
02:47:00,350 --> 02:47:01,390
Surreal music.

2377
02:47:03,850 --> 02:47:05,470
Oh, that's a bear.

2378
02:47:06,750 --> 02:47:07,270
Easy.

2379
02:47:08,070 --> 02:47:09,210
Oh, that's a wolf.

2380
02:47:09,670 --> 02:47:10,410
Oh, that's a wolf.

2381
02:47:12,870 --> 02:47:15,030
Okay, it was brown.

2382
02:47:15,430 --> 02:47:17,720
I don't know if I'm supposed to know

2383
02:47:21,490 --> 02:47:29,790
No, no, oh, no, he's having his furry awakening right now.

2384
02:47:30,390 --> 02:47:34,010
No, I say his turn back See you around the other side.

2385
02:47:34,310 --> 02:47:34,850
Oh, no.

2386
02:47:35,450 --> 02:47:39,330
Why is my controller making me walk towards the wolf?

2387
02:47:41,110 --> 02:47:45,170
This is I swear, guys, it's not me.

2388
02:47:47,370 --> 02:47:48,170
Where am I?

2389
02:47:49,510 --> 02:47:50,570
Can you understand me?

2390
02:47:53,510 --> 02:47:54,430
Two wolves.

2391
02:47:55,550 --> 02:47:56,110
Hi there.

2392
02:47:59,590 --> 02:48:01,110
So, where are we going?

02:49:45,510 --> 02:49:46,970
It's like a convention.

02:49:48,210 --> 02:49:49,570
Is there a convention in town?

2409
02:49:50,730 --> 02:49:51,290

2413
02:50:05,340 --> 02:50:06,620

02:50:29,040 --> 02:50:29,800
Young woman!

2420
02:50:33,680 --> 02:50:34,640
Yeah, we're kidding.

2421
02:50:34,820 --> 02:50:36,580
Dana's made from the bark of the ironwood trees.

2422
02:50:37,960 --> 02:50:41,660
They absorb the memories of the forest so that the paint
remembers too.

2423
02:50:42,100 --> 02:50:42,820
Oh, shit.

2424
02:50:43,540 --> 02:50:44,860
Memories of the past.

2425
02:50:48,350 --> 02:50:49,290
Who are you?

2426
02:50:49,370 --> 02:50:50,010
Of the future.

2427
02:50:58,080 --> 02:50:59,440
I'd hate to get blood on it.

2428
02:51:06,830 --> 02:51:09,350
So it is that type of tree.

2429
02:51:15,150 --> 02:51:16,190
I mean,

2430
02:51:21,920 --> 02:51:23,440
she was painting me, wasn't she?

2431
02:51:24,540 --> 02:51:24,960
What's wrong?

2432
02:51:27,340 --> 02:51:29,760
I've been waiting my whole life for this moment.

2433
02:51:38,670 --> 02:51:39,710
You look...

2434
02:51:39,710 --> 02:51:41,090
Weirder than I imagined.

2435
02:51:43,330 --> 02:51:43,430
Oh.

2436
02:51:44,050 --> 02:51:45,350
Is that supposed to me?

2437
02:51:46,090 --> 02:51:46,350
Sorry.

2438
02:51:50,530 --> 02:51:52,550
Um, was that mean?

2439
02:51:53,170 --> 02:51:54,330
I don't know.

2440
02:51:54,690 --> 02:51:55,370
Damn it.

2441
02:51:56,190 --> 02:51:57,710
I'm already messing this up.

2442
02:51:59,090 --> 02:52:03,770
It's just, you're the first person that I've talked to in a
very long time.

2443
02:52:06,510 --> 02:52:08,350
Is this going to be my first girlfriend?

2444
02:52:09,110 --> 02:52:10,670
Uh, thanks.

2445
02:52:14,650 --> 02:52:18,350
I feel like Arteus has not, like, encountered, like, women
his age, too.

It is, my name.

2451
02:52:52,190 --> 02:52:53,790
It's not a horse or a wolf.

2452
02:52:54,830 --> 02:52:55,690
We did it.

2453
02:52:56,390 --> 02:52:57,890
We've succeeded in parenting.

2454
02:52:59,550 --> 02:53:00,790
Oh, there is hope.

2455
02:53:04,750 --> 02:53:06,650
He loves women.

2456
02:53:06,930 --> 02:53:08,590
Guys, human women.

2457
02:53:09,330 --> 02:53:12,350
Just remember, it's human women.

2458
02:53:15,250 --> 02:53:16,690
We did it.

2459
02:53:21,950 --> 02:53:22,470
All right.

2460
02:53:22,510 --> 02:53:23,090
Nice.

2461
02:53:26,330 --> 02:53:27,190
And then we get...

2462
02:53:27,190 --> 02:53:27,770
Oh, nice.

2463
02:53:27,910 --> 02:53:28,470
Oh, shit.

2464
02:53:28,670 --> 02:53:28,970
That's good.

2465
02:53:29,130 --> 02:53:30,110
We actually...

2466
02:53:30,110 --> 02:53:31,350
Let's grab...

2467
02:53:31,350 --> 02:53:31,970
Oh, a horn.

2468
02:53:32,310 --> 02:53:32,750
Okay, yeah.

2469
02:53:32,830 --> 02:53:33,730
We can charge it up.

2470
02:53:33,790 --> 02:53:34,690
That's good, actually.

2471
02:53:39,140 --> 02:53:39,620
She's...

2472
02:53:39,620 --> 02:53:40,460
She's human.

2473
02:53:40,780 --> 02:53:43,000
She has two legs and two arms.

2474
02:53:43,360 --> 02:53:44,700
And she's standing upright.

2475
02:53:44,980 --> 02:53:46,700
That's as human as it can get.

2476
02:53:46,860 --> 02:53:47,640
This weird fog.

2477
02:53:48,340 --> 02:53:50,680
I've heard the Uten Guard can be disorienting.

2478
02:53:51,160 --> 02:53:52,720
Still, you're safe here in the Ironwood.

2479
02:53:54,740 --> 02:54:00,440
also what in my what in my joyfriends like cj would be like
where the fuck did he go

2480
02:54:13,640 --> 02:54:21,000
so i thought ironwood wasn't a real place my stand my
standards for his future girlfriend was very low as long as

2481
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:29,420
it's a human woman then like that's all that matters wait
what are you all dead

2482
02:54:33,540 --> 02:54:37,060
I see she's talking about how the other giants are dead now.

2483
02:54:47,100 --> 02:54:47,600
What's that?

2484
02:54:48,500 --> 02:54:49,660
It's big.

2485
02:54:50,520 --> 02:54:50,660
Whoa.

2486
02:54:51,360 --> 02:54:54,980
I thought giants weren't all supposed to be giant.

2487
02:54:58,040 --> 02:54:59,560
I mean, you're not giant.

2488
02:55:01,820 --> 02:55:04,120
So that's not a good comparison.

2489
02:55:05,060 --> 02:55:15,940

Thank you So me the test doesn't count You're doing before

2504
02:56:15,700 --> 02:56:21,140

2505
02:56:31,250 --> 02:56:32,910
Guys thank you for the super chat.

2506
02:56:33,090 --> 02:56:33,230
Thank you.

2507
02:56:33,390 --> 02:56:33,810
Thank you.

2508
02:56:33,830 --> 02:56:41,200
She's the mother of veneer and her I'll be annoying.

2509
02:56:41,760 --> 02:56:43,600
No, she's she's woman-shaped guys.

2510
02:56:43,800 --> 02:56:53,040
No, no, no, no, no, no, she is woman-shaped Maybe she's
also, we shared, maybe she's also a fellow furry, you know?

2511
02:56:53,460 --> 02:56:59,440
Maybe we just, uh, maybe, maybe Arteus and her just shared
similar interests.

2512
02:56:59,880 --> 02:57:03,480
But in the end, in the end, they chose each other.

2513
02:57:04,300 --> 02:57:08,540
So I, as Kratos, have succeeded in parenting.

2514
02:57:09,640 --> 02:57:10,860
Is that chainmail?

2515
02:57:11,720 --> 02:57:14,840
Women shaped so it doesn't count.

2516
02:57:17,360 --> 02:57:18,540
Kind of?

2517
02:57:19,520 --> 02:57:21,060
You Midgard Giants are strange.

2518
02:57:21,580 --> 02:57:22,540
They're dwarves, actually.

2519
02:57:22,960 --> 02:57:23,720
Still strange.

2520
02:57:24,360 --> 02:57:24,720
Wait.

2521
02:57:24,980 --> 02:57:27,360
I can't believe there are nightmares here too.

2522
02:57:28,760 --> 02:57:30,980
Yeah, that's crazy that they're here.

2523
02:57:31,960 --> 02:57:33,560
Why are they here?

2524
02:57:53,050 --> 02:57:54,410
They're not...

2525
02:57:54,410 --> 02:57:55,890
I should shoot something here.

2526
02:57:57,270 --> 02:57:58,030
Oh, this.

2527
02:58:08,520 --> 02:58:09,280
Can I shoot this?

2528
02:58:09,360 --> 02:58:09,520
Yes.

2529
02:58:09,680 --> 02:58:11,860
I was gonna say it's a fence.

2530
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:13,340
Can I shoot the fence?

2531
02:58:15,920 --> 02:58:17,780
It's just something my father...

2532
02:58:18,560 --> 02:58:18,980
You know what?

2533
02:58:19,580 --> 02:58:19,900
Never mind.

2534
02:58:19,960 --> 02:58:21,520
I don't want to talk about my dad right now.

2535
02:58:21,840 --> 02:58:23,020
This is my angst phase.

2536
02:58:26,400 --> 02:58:28,860
I want... We're here to talk about me.

2537
02:58:29,800 --> 02:58:30,160
Hello?

2538
02:58:30,380 --> 02:58:33,400
Your entire purpose is to tell me my destiny.

2539
02:58:36,220 --> 02:58:37,900
So I don't want to talk about me.

2540
02:58:43,140 --> 02:58:44,380
That's okay, right?

2541
02:58:45,300 --> 02:58:48,600
Oh, my God.

2542
02:58:49,060 --> 02:58:49,920
Oh, I just...

2543
02:58:50,520 --> 02:58:51,980
Thank you for the super chat.

2544
02:58:52,280 --> 02:58:52,420
Thank you.

2545
02:58:52,580 --> 02:58:53,120
Thank you.

2546
02:58:54,760 --> 02:59:00,480
I think the OG missed Loki actually consumes her heart after
she gets pregnant and Loki gives birth to their children.

2547
02:59:01,620 --> 02:59:02,240
Oh, my...

2548
02:59:03,320 --> 02:59:04,400
I do not.

2549
02:59:10,230 --> 02:59:11,090
Holy shit.

2550
02:59:11,110 --> 02:59:16,170
Shit, that's, that's too, that's too kinky for even me,
Arteus.

2551
02:59:17,810 --> 02:59:20,390
That's just like, damn, bro.

2552
02:59:20,710 --> 02:59:22,570
It looks like you're going the right way.

2553
02:59:23,250 --> 02:59:25,030
Oh, these guys are wild in bed.

2554
02:59:28,170 --> 02:59:29,290
Holy shit.

2555
02:59:30,070 --> 02:59:32,010
That shit is wild, Loki.

2556
02:59:34,150 --> 02:59:37,550
No, that was like, oh my god.

2557
02:59:38,170 --> 02:59:39,290
That's too wild, bro.

2558
02:59:41,750 --> 02:59:44,730
I think she forgot to say the safe word.

2559
02:59:50,620 --> 02:59:52,720
He's like, that's how I want to go.

2560
02:59:52,840 --> 02:59:53,340
I'm great.

2561
02:59:53,720 --> 02:59:55,240
I met another living giant.

2562
02:59:56,500 --> 02:59:57,680
What's my destiny?

2563
02:59:57,880 --> 02:59:58,100
What?

2564
02:59:59,320 --> 02:59:59,640
Sorry.

2565
03:00:00,220 --> 03:00:01,940
I'm just really excited to talk to you.

2566
03:00:03,140 --> 03:00:05,360
Bro, no, he's fumbling it.

2567
03:00:05,660 --> 03:00:06,520
He's fumbling.

2568
03:00:07,100 --> 03:00:08,480
He hasn't talked to another.

2569
03:00:08,760 --> 03:00:11,740
He's been talking to animals for too long.

2570
03:00:13,780 --> 03:00:23,860
he's been talking to animals for too fucking long he doesn't
know how to talk to another person yeah i'm just in a

Okay, my parents, my one parent is also dead.

We have such good chemistry.

2601
03:02:24,280 --> 03:02:24,880
It's fate.

2602
03:02:25,380 --> 03:02:25,620
Look at that.

2603
03:02:25,720 --> 03:02:27,080
We're doing combos together.

2604
03:02:28,540 --> 03:02:29,800
Like a champion.

2605
03:02:30,620 --> 03:02:31,020
Thanks.

2606
03:02:31,200 --> 03:02:32,220

2611

She cheated.

2620
03:04:02,100 --> 03:04:03,720
She took a shortcut.

2621
03:04:06,480 --> 03:04:08,480
Well, you beat me.

2622
03:04:09,800 --> 03:04:11,720
I mean, I already knew that that.

2623
03:04:12,100 --> 03:04:13,600
Yeah, that's cheating.

2624
03:04:14,760 --> 03:04:15,240
Exactly.

2625
03:04:15,480 --> 03:04:16,640
See, she agrees with me.

2626
03:04:16,820 --> 03:04:17,380
Women.

2627
03:04:19,180 --> 03:04:19,900
Tackle worm.

2628
03:04:20,460 --> 03:04:21,360
I've seen this before.

2629
03:04:21,680 --> 03:04:23,060
Well, then you should know how to beat them.

2630
03:04:25,320 --> 03:04:26,280
Summon spirits.

2631
03:04:28,540 --> 03:04:30,280
It's usually not so lively right now.

2632
03:04:30,320 --> 03:04:31,160
Oh my god, what the fuck?

2633
03:04:32,400 --> 03:04:33,320
That's a bird.

2634
03:04:33,340 --> 03:04:34,320
You're just lucky.

2635
03:04:37,840 --> 03:04:41,500
Oh my god, look, we're laughing in the middle of the fight,
guys.

2636
03:04:41,780 --> 03:04:42,880
Oh my god.

2637
03:04:46,580 --> 03:04:47,640
Look at this.

2638
03:04:47,860 --> 03:04:48,960
Oh, we're finding.

2639
03:04:52,580 --> 03:04:54,340

Look, I'm talking to my first woman ever.

2644
03:05:32,380 --> 03:05:33,820
It's not going to be perfect.

2645
03:05:35,760 --> 03:05:38,900
We can all fumble the bag a little bit.

2646
03:05:39,020 --> 03:05:39,900
Just a little bit.

2647
03:05:40,080 --> 03:05:42,780
This is her way of ensuring the legacy of our people would
live on.

2648
03:05:43,080 --> 03:05:45,080
Despite the ACR's best efforts.

2649
03:05:49,860 --> 03:05:50,560
It's okay.

2650
03:05:50,620 --> 03:05:51,700
It's just a small fumble.

2651
03:05:52,060 --> 03:05:52,120
Oh, wow.

2652
03:05:52,940 --> 03:05:55,180
Oh, you'll see plenty more button clamps today.

2653
03:05:55,660 --> 03:05:56,320
I hope so.

2654
03:05:59,220 --> 03:06:00,060
Oh, really?

2655
03:06:01,000 --> 03:06:07,800
Oh, I hope so, because that means I get to spend more time
with you, Malini.

2656
03:06:09,720 --> 03:06:10,200
Here.

2657
03:06:11,480 --> 03:06:13,000
Guys, I'm just trying to make it more immersive.

2658
03:06:17,540 --> 03:06:18,500
Oh, yeah.

2659
03:06:19,640 --> 03:06:20,720
You know what, Daniel magic?

2660
03:06:21,140 --> 03:06:22,520
Where do you think they learned it from?

2661
03:06:22,860 --> 03:06:23,340
Stop.

2662
03:06:23,760 --> 03:06:24,340
Here we are.

2663
03:06:24,620 --> 03:06:25,040
Here we are.

2664
03:06:25,040 --> 03:06:25,660
Do you live here?

2665
03:06:26,660 --> 03:06:27,100
This way.

2666
03:06:27,420 --> 03:06:28,900
How are you gross?

2667
03:06:29,500 --> 03:06:29,980

walking it.

2672
03:07:12,420 --> 03:07:17,720
Of course, others see the future and get messed up by it.

2673
03:07:25,590 --> 03:07:25,590
Ready?

2674
03:07:26,590 --> 03:07:28,150
Yeah, I'm ready.

2675
03:07:34,710 --> 03:07:35,990
The future.

2676
03:07:36,710 --> 03:07:37,610
My destiny.

2677
03:07:41,620 --> 03:07:42,560
I've seen this before.

2678
03:07:43,340 --> 03:07:44,620
Where we scattered Mother's ashes.

2679
03:07:45,680 --> 03:07:46,380
It was on the wall.

2680
03:07:47,100 --> 03:07:48,180
Everything had happened already.

2681
03:07:48,520 --> 03:08:03,320
This is the way it's but this part was damaged oh that's us

What?

2686
03:08:33,340 --> 03:08:35,580
What the prophecy said?

2687
03:08:35,880 --> 03:08:36,060
I was...

2688
03:08:36,060 --> 03:08:36,920
Ungar's not real.

2689
03:08:37,620 --> 03:08:38,880
None of this is real.

2690
03:08:40,880 --> 03:08:42,420
Oh, fuck no!

2691
03:08:51,770 --> 03:08:51,990
No.

2692
03:08:52,710 --> 03:08:53,410
I failed.

2693
03:08:54,270 --> 03:08:55,050
I failed.

2694
03:08:55,730 --> 03:08:56,310
Calm down.

2695
03:08:56,690 --> 03:08:57,230
Calm down.

2696
03:08:57,950 --> 03:08:58,370
You're fine.

2697
03:09:02,900 --> 03:09:03,200
Jesus.

2698
03:09:05,680 --> 03:09:05,800
Hey.

2699
03:09:06,940 --> 03:09:07,120
Hey, breathe.

2700
03:09:08,260 --> 03:09:09,780
is very sad.

2701
03:09:12,620 --> 03:09:13,200
That's good.

2702
03:09:14,840 --> 03:09:15,840
See, it's okay.

2703
03:09:17,240 --> 03:09:17,640
Oh.

2704
03:09:17,980 --> 03:09:19,480
Let it go.

2705
03:09:20,760 --> 03:09:21,660
Come on back.

2706
03:09:29,190 --> 03:09:29,610
It's okay.

2707
03:09:30,070 --> 03:09:31,610
You're fine.

2708
03:09:32,770 --> 03:09:33,330
Sorry.

2709
03:09:34,270 --> 03:09:35,170
I don't know what happened.

2710
03:09:35,490 --> 03:09:36,490
Don't worry about it.

2711
03:09:36,750 --> 03:09:37,890
It happens to everyone.

2712
03:09:38,070 --> 03:09:39,070
She accepted him.

2713
03:09:39,390 --> 03:09:40,190
There's still hope.

2714
03:09:40,250 --> 03:09:42,810
Not the wolf part, but getting scared about your future.

2715
03:09:42,830 --> 03:09:43,210
Oh my god.

2716
03:09:43,370 --> 03:09:43,930
That's fine.

2717
03:09:44,750 --> 03:09:47,570
It says I serve Odin and my father dies.

2718
03:09:47,870 --> 03:09:48,710
There's just no way.

2719
03:09:48,830 --> 03:09:50,990
Look, this is the only way things turn out.

2720
03:09:51,410 --> 03:09:52,950
The sooner you accept that, the better.

2721
03:09:53,990 --> 03:09:56,550
Wait, but then the other prophecy says he dies.

2722
03:09:56,770 --> 03:09:57,570
Shit, that was mean to.

2723
03:10:01,390 --> 03:10:02,450
She accepted me.

2724
03:10:02,470 --> 03:10:03,550
There's still hope, guys.

2725
03:10:04,870 --> 03:10:06,450
Just forget about that now.

2726
03:10:07,350 --> 03:10:08,010
Yes, there's still hope.

2727
03:10:08,090 --> 03:10:08,950
It was just a one time.

2728
03:10:09,570 --> 03:10:10,810
It was one time.

2729
03:10:12,910 --> 03:10:14,030
You're a giant.

stuff.

2740
03:11:29,140 --> 03:11:31,920
But first, I want you to meet someone.

2741
03:11:32,220 --> 03:11:33,760

Perspective.

2749
03:11:52,260 --> 03:11:52,440
Perspective.

2750
03:11:53,820 --> 03:11:54,980
Perspective goes hard.

2751
03:11:55,280 --> 03:11:56,060
She's a big girl.

2752
03:12:04,390 --> 03:12:06,730
By controller, does she take me somewhere?

Ganga.

the cute girls.

happen I wouldn't join Odin if it caught the trauma if i

2781
03:15:38,150 --> 03:15:44,330

dad dad taught me things have a way of coming true one way

2782
03:15:44,330 --> 03:15:54,490
or another i learned from my father to close your heart to
it yeah see that's it see is that told him to suppress his

2783
03:15:54,490 --> 03:15:56,390
emotions and his feelings

2784
03:16:02,410 --> 03:16:03,890

do it yeah my father wasn't helping me figure out my destiny

2787
03:16:38,300 --> 03:16:47,200
when Odin and I were alone he offered to teach me if you
were alone with Odin he could have easily killed you I mean

My parents taught me.

2796
03:17:11,180 --> 03:17:12,440
It's a delicate guessing game.

03:17:13,080 --> 03:17:15,480
So you can't be sure of everything that's going to happen
then?

2928
03:28:45,280 --> 03:28:53,720
I had to show...

2929
03:28:53,720 --> 03:28:56,060
My girl wanted to see the wolf.

2930
03:28:57,440 --> 03:28:59,180
Give my girl what she wants.

2931
03:29:01,640 --> 03:29:04,780
Gotta press the ladies, guys.

2932
03:29:06,380 --> 03:29:08,380
She asked for it!

2933
03:29:10,920 --> 03:29:12,320
There you go.

2934
03:29:17,600 --> 03:29:19,440
All right, here we go.

2935
03:29:21,420 --> 03:29:26,830
All right, yeah.

2936
03:29:27,790 --> 03:29:31,090
Yeah, like I'm not in control.

2937
03:29:31,970 --> 03:29:44,170
I show her the I show her the alpha inside me On the first
date too You're freaky, freaky.

2938
03:29:45,490 --> 03:29:46,310
Oh, back to roots.

2939
03:29:46,650 --> 03:29:48,390
Well, at least there's some roots down here.

2940
03:29:48,730 --> 03:29:52,790
Grab them while we look- It's wolf in time.

2941
03:29:54,790 --> 03:29:55,190
Solid.

2942
03:29:55,530 --> 03:29:56,590
Thank you for the super chat.

2943
03:29:56,810 --> 03:29:57,010
Thank you.

2944
03:29:57,570 --> 03:29:57,830
Thank you.

2945
03:29:58,850 --> 03:29:59,430
That's your answer.

2946
03:29:59,610 --> 03:30:00,530
Thank you for the super chat.

2947
03:30:00,730 --> 03:30:01,310
Thank you.

2948
03:30:01,310 --> 03:30:01,430
Thank you.

2949
03:30:01,450 --> 03:30:02,230
I took you in time.

2950
03:30:02,290 --> 03:30:03,370
Pay you sing animals.

2951
03:30:03,970 --> 03:30:05,070
Run for room five.

2952
03:30:07,690 --> 03:30:08,270
Oh, shit.

2953
03:30:08,370 --> 03:30:09,210
That's a big boy.

2954
03:30:12,670 --> 03:30:13,330
Fuck it.

2955
03:30:14,390 --> 03:30:15,190
Oh, wait.

2956
03:30:15,370 --> 03:30:16,610
I almost got it.

2957
03:30:16,870 --> 03:30:17,870
That's Afri.

2958
03:30:18,670 --> 03:30:19,210
It's all right.

2959
03:30:19,750 --> 03:30:22,050
I got the stag in me now, though.

2960
03:30:23,610 --> 03:30:26,530
Oh my god, the stag in me.

2961
03:30:26,750 --> 03:30:30,690
There you go.

2962
03:30:33,170 --> 03:30:33,350
Oh!

2963
03:30:35,750 --> 03:30:36,350
Nice.

2964
03:30:39,590 --> 03:30:41,690
Try and charge this up.

2965
03:30:42,670 --> 03:30:44,290
charge this up too.

2966
03:30:46,050 --> 03:30:46,750
I've got you.

2967
03:30:47,390 --> 03:30:47,930
Oh, shit.

2968
03:30:48,070 --> 03:30:49,350
She got me, though.

2969
03:30:50,290 --> 03:30:50,530
Okay.

2970
03:30:51,070 --> 03:30:52,790
Maybe I don't pull up roots for a little bit.

2971
03:30:53,730 --> 03:30:54,370
It wasn't you.

2972
03:30:55,110 --> 03:30:56,690
Hey, looks like they opened up a path over there.

2973
03:30:56,790 --> 03:30:57,170
Oh, nice.

2974
03:30:57,410 --> 03:30:58,930
Let's catch up with Yala before more of them show up.

2975
03:30:59,290 --> 03:31:00,550
Yeah, I hope Yala's okay.

2976
03:31:02,850 --> 03:31:03,290
Animal.

2977
03:31:06,990 --> 03:31:11,710
Bada-bada-bada-bada-bada-bada-bada-bada-bada-bada-bada-bada-bada-bada.

2978
03:31:13,630 --> 03:31:15,210
We're practically made.

2979
03:31:15,450 --> 03:31:15,710
You're okay.

2980
03:31:17,130 --> 03:31:17,870
But what about you, Loki?

2981
03:31:18,450 --> 03:31:19,590
What do you feel when you change?

2982
03:31:20,130 --> 03:31:22,270
Just anger.

2983
03:31:23,270 --> 03:31:25,290
Part of you unleashed the wolf with that anger.

2984
03:31:26,290 --> 03:31:28,450
Maybe you just need to find the part that will guide it.

2985
03:31:28,650 --> 03:31:28,970
How?

2986
03:31:29,630 --> 03:31:33,070
You can fight with all sorts of emotion in your heart, not
just rage.

2987
03:31:33,930 --> 03:31:36,150
If rage lets it out, another might help you.

2988
03:31:36,910 --> 03:31:37,650
Stay you.

2989
03:31:38,410 --> 03:31:40,750
Oh my god, there are two wolves inside me.

2990
03:31:42,670 --> 03:31:44,070
You enjoyed that, didn't you?

2991
03:31:46,650 --> 03:31:48,870
Oh my god, one wolf is angry.

2992
03:31:49,510 --> 03:31:51,510
The other wolf is in control.

2993
03:31:52,810 --> 03:31:53,310
Home again.

2994
03:31:53,730 --> 03:31:53,870
Yeah.

2995
03:31:54,150 --> 03:31:54,930
I made it.

2996
03:31:55,110 --> 03:31:57,430
Let's drop off these roots in the bucket up on the left
here.

2997
03:31:58,070 --> 03:32:00,870
Then, I've got one last thing to show you.

2998
03:32:01,770 --> 03:32:02,050
Oh.

2999
03:32:06,460 --> 03:32:07,280
You okay?

3000
03:32:07,600 --> 03:32:09,100
Yeah, just...

3001
03:32:11,080 --> 03:32:13,160
We should head back toward the water.

3002
03:32:13,440 --> 03:32:13,740
Oh?

3003
03:32:13,820 --> 03:32:14,220
This way.

3004
03:32:15,100 --> 03:32:16,840
Is it alright if we stick around longer?

3005
03:32:17,500 --> 03:32:21,060
Might want to, you know, repair some stuff.

3006
03:32:21,600 --> 03:32:21,840
Yes.

3007
03:32:23,840 --> 03:32:24,160
Oh?

3008
03:32:24,520 --> 03:32:24,740
Oh.

3009
03:32:24,920 --> 03:32:25,700
Repair stuff.

3010
03:32:25,800 --> 03:32:26,680
I guess from here?

3011
03:32:28,480 --> 03:32:30,940
Is there anything in here that I need to look at?

3012
03:32:32,240 --> 03:32:33,960
I mean, everything's fine.

3013
03:32:36,300 --> 03:32:37,940
Oh, everything seems fine.

3014
03:32:38,520 --> 03:32:39,660
Oh, I just wanted to spend...

3015
03:32:39,660 --> 03:32:41,340
Yeah, oh, we're so smooth.

3016
03:32:41,480 --> 03:32:41,640
Yeah.

3017
03:32:42,380 --> 03:32:42,860
Repair.

3018
03:32:46,260 --> 03:32:47,940
Yeah, yeah, sure, boy.

3019
03:32:48,380 --> 03:32:51,380
You want to repair some stuff, right?

3020
03:32:58,790 --> 03:32:59,310
Alright.

3021
03:33:00,610 --> 03:33:01,510
Let's go.

3022
03:33:06,030 --> 03:33:08,010
Are there any animals you can turn into?

3023
03:33:08,610 --> 03:33:09,070
Not yet.

3024
03:33:09,470 --> 03:33:12,750
But for you, that might be a god thing and not a giant
thing.

3025
03:33:13,270 --> 03:33:13,550
Oh.

3026
03:33:13,990 --> 03:33:15,290
Thanks for rubbing it in, though.

3027
03:33:15,710 --> 03:33:16,230
Sorry.

3028
03:33:16,490 --> 03:33:16,870
Joking.

3029
03:33:17,730 --> 03:33:19,210
Through the tunnel on the right, y'all.

3030
03:33:19,470 --> 03:33:20,230
That's where we're headed.

3031
03:33:20,250 --> 03:33:21,130
Oh, okay.

3032
03:33:22,610 --> 03:33:23,630
I'm Yala.

3033
03:33:24,490 --> 03:33:25,170
Head of end.

3034
03:33:27,970 --> 03:33:28,810
Oh, la.

3035
03:33:29,670 --> 03:33:30,110
Oh.

3036
03:33:30,670 --> 03:33:32,110
I really like that spell.

3037
03:33:32,610 --> 03:33:33,470
That's so cool.

3038
03:33:34,510 --> 03:33:37,630
Maybe that's why I couldn't sense any other giants when
Father and I visited.

3039
03:33:40,450 --> 03:33:41,110
Wait, there's loot.

3040
03:33:42,210 --> 03:33:42,990
Oh, my gosh.

3041
03:33:43,050 --> 03:33:43,790
She's perfect.

3042
03:33:44,950 --> 03:33:45,970
She knows magic.

3043
03:33:46,190 --> 03:33:47,110
I know magic.

3044
03:33:47,930 --> 03:33:48,910
She's okay.

3045
03:33:49,270 --> 03:33:51,430
She likes it when I unleash the beast.

3046
03:33:57,330 --> 03:33:59,230
We're made for each other.

3047
03:33:59,570 --> 03:34:01,710
So, what's that soul in your knife?

3048
03:34:01,950 --> 03:34:02,350
The what?

3049
03:34:04,050 --> 03:34:06,630
There's a soul inside your knife.

3050
03:34:07,810 --> 03:34:08,510
It's Fenier!

3051
03:34:09,110 --> 03:34:09,370
No.

3052
03:34:10,030 --> 03:34:10,690
Who's soul?

3053
03:34:11,410 --> 03:34:14,310
You know, maybe you should keep it where it is until you
figure that out.

3054
03:34:14,830 --> 03:34:14,930
Oh!

3055
03:34:16,110 --> 03:34:16,990
I don't just...

3056
03:34:16,990 --> 03:34:18,990
Is Fenier gonna help me control my wolf?

3057
03:34:21,950 --> 03:34:23,390
How the fuck do I get that?

3058
03:34:23,810 --> 03:34:26,230
Y'all can swim around and meet us on the other side.

3059
03:34:27,290 --> 03:34:28,490
Okay, but I want to get this.

3060
03:34:29,110 --> 03:34:30,170
How the fuck do I get that?

3061
03:34:30,330 --> 03:34:31,750
Oh, I know how.

3062
03:34:32,570 --> 03:34:33,070
Watch this.

3063
03:34:33,330 --> 03:34:34,170
I figured it out.

3064
03:34:35,290 --> 03:34:37,070
This puzzle is no match for me.

3065
03:34:37,810 --> 03:34:38,490
I'm smart.

3066
03:34:40,750 --> 03:34:41,550
Watch this.

3067
03:34:42,930 --> 03:34:43,990
Ha ha ha.

3068
03:34:44,230 --> 03:34:45,530
Just drop from that clam too.

3069
03:34:46,110 --> 03:34:46,770
Want to check it out?

3070
03:34:48,010 --> 03:34:49,950
Oh my god, he's going to be the Mufasa.

3071
03:34:53,880 --> 03:34:59,220
Yeah, I'm pretty sure Venya's going to teach me out of
control my wolf oh nice we actually needed a beast bone

3072
03:35:09,030 --> 03:35:17,830
all right where do we go okay she is going left which means
i can go

3073
03:35:23,270 --> 03:35:30,230
left what you're doing what you're doing clears my mind i
try to see how many bounces i can get oh you're like

3074
03:35:30,230 --> 03:35:34,370
skipping stones looks easy enough

3075
03:35:38,930 --> 03:35:48,470
yo oh apparently not as easy a little help no i i think i
got it and you're like it's it's the rock guys it's the rock

3076
03:35:48,470 --> 03:35:55,370
we all know when you're skipping stones the rock has to be
the perfect shape for it because if it's two and it's not

3077
03:35:55,370 --> 03:36:01,650
like if it's not like sharp then it can't skip and He
purposely gave me a shitty rock.

3078
03:36:01,810 --> 03:36:03,910
I might need a little help.

3079
03:36:03,950 --> 03:36:04,730
You'll get it.

3080
03:36:04,930 --> 03:36:05,430
Throw a flatter.

3081
03:36:06,010 --> 03:36:06,930
It's all about timing.

3082
03:36:07,370 --> 03:36:08,810
When you release the rock.

3083
03:36:09,790 --> 03:36:12,830
Yeah, the rock is the most important factor.

3084
03:36:13,710 --> 03:36:14,570
Oh shit!

3085
03:36:15,590 --> 03:36:18,370
Bring the wolf Loki, but under your control.

3086
03:36:19,510 --> 03:36:20,470
I don't have to.

3087
03:36:21,570 --> 03:36:22,610
Oh shit.

3088
03:36:24,650 --> 03:36:26,290
I mean, he's gonna get them.

3089
03:36:27,590 --> 03:36:27,950
Alright.

3090
03:36:28,690 --> 03:36:29,910
I am in control.

3091
03:36:29,930 --> 03:36:32,930
I am in control!

3092
03:36:34,350 --> 03:36:38,690
Guys, I'm controlling him!

3093
03:36:40,210 --> 03:36:41,890
I am so in control!

3094
03:36:47,670 --> 03:36:49,090
Alright, nice.

3095
03:36:52,570 --> 03:36:53,670
Alright, there you go.

3096
03:36:53,910 --> 03:36:55,610
So much control!

3097
03:37:02,610 --> 03:37:04,890
Alright, let's get rid of this gap.

3098
03:37:07,410 --> 03:37:08,330
What the fuck?

3099
03:37:11,670 --> 03:37:12,210
Oh shit!

3100
03:37:13,970 --> 03:37:15,490
Okay, that guy is a big boy.

3101
03:37:21,710 --> 03:37:22,330
There you go.

3102
03:37:22,870 --> 03:37:23,970
I'll use my stag.

3103
03:37:27,810 --> 03:37:28,290
Boom!

3104
03:37:29,290 --> 03:37:29,870
There you go.

3105
03:37:31,790 --> 03:37:33,190
Oh, that's a lot of damage.

3106
03:37:33,910 --> 03:37:34,130
Ready.

3107
03:37:34,890 --> 03:37:35,890
That didn't count, by the way.

3108
03:37:36,470 --> 03:37:37,090
My last throw.

3109
03:37:37,490 --> 03:37:38,210
Oh, it counts.

3110
03:37:38,370 --> 03:37:39,630
A troger came out of the water.

3111
03:37:39,710 --> 03:37:40,870
Yeah, that's not fair.

3112
03:37:42,210 --> 03:37:42,510
What?

3113
03:37:43,070 --> 03:37:44,730
I never make any excuses.

3114
03:37:46,810 --> 03:37:46,950
All right.

3115
03:37:47,390 --> 03:37:49,450
Watch this.

3116
03:37:54,420 --> 03:37:55,120
Watch this.

3117
03:37:57,400 --> 03:37:57,540
Hold.

3118
03:37:58,260 --> 03:37:58,520
Release.

3119
03:37:59,620 --> 03:38:01,040
Oh, did she saw that?

3120
03:38:01,140 --> 03:38:01,700
Did she saw that?

3121
03:38:03,140 --> 03:38:04,000
Did she saw that?

3122
03:38:04,140 --> 03:38:04,820
Do you think she saw that?

3123
03:38:06,560 --> 03:38:08,700
Oh, and another one!

3124
03:38:08,760 --> 03:38:10,060
You want to release the rock earlier.

3125
03:38:15,810 --> 03:38:16,690
There we go.

3126
03:38:16,850 --> 03:38:17,650
You got to release it earlier.

3127
03:38:17,790 --> 03:38:18,370
What do you mean?

3128
03:38:19,350 --> 03:38:21,090
Okay, you fucking liar.

3129
03:38:22,730 --> 03:38:23,710
There we go.

3130
03:38:23,850 --> 03:38:24,510
Nice throw.

3131
03:38:25,190 --> 03:38:25,490
Yeah!

3132
03:38:26,850 --> 03:38:28,350
Look, she complimented me.

3133
03:38:28,550 --> 03:38:29,210
Almost there.

3134
03:38:29,630 --> 03:38:30,350
Okay, what the fuck do you mean?

3135
03:38:30,470 --> 03:38:30,930
Almost there.

3136
03:38:32,290 --> 03:38:32,630
Wow.

3137
03:38:32,970 --> 03:38:33,710
Oh, shit.

3138
03:38:35,270 --> 03:38:36,290
I did it.

3139
03:38:39,510 --> 03:38:39,990
See?

3140
03:38:40,010 --> 03:38:41,570
She saw it, guys.

3141
03:38:41,930 --> 03:38:43,130
She saw it.

3142
03:38:48,100 --> 03:38:50,040
I don't like the five of it being Fenrir.

3143
03:38:50,440 --> 03:38:50,880
So, raw.

3144
03:38:51,140 --> 03:38:53,240
This level three five troll is too tough.

3145
03:38:53,800 --> 03:38:54,480
I'm sorry.

3146
03:38:54,700 --> 03:38:58,660
I must release the beast and go full Fenrir mo.

3147
03:38:59,840 --> 03:39:01,480
Thank you for the super chat about you.

3148
03:39:01,780 --> 03:39:02,210
Thank you.

3149
03:39:02,780 --> 03:39:03,560
Where are we going now?

3150
03:39:04,020 --> 03:39:04,600
I have something.

3151
03:39:05,020 --> 03:39:06,360
Yes, to unleash the beast.

3152
03:39:07,440 --> 03:39:08,240
Gift, I guess.

3153
03:39:08,760 --> 03:39:10,240
Should I be scared?

3154
03:39:10,760 --> 03:39:11,600
I'll get there.

3155
03:39:13,440 --> 03:39:15,800
I don't have anything for you.

3156
03:39:16,700 --> 03:39:17,180
Oh, here.

3157
03:39:21,390 --> 03:39:23,150
That means for next time.

3158
03:39:24,170 --> 03:39:25,410
That means I have to...

3159
03:39:25,410 --> 03:39:26,190
Bro, bro.

3160
03:39:27,710 --> 03:39:29,270
Bro, Arteus, stupid.

3161
03:39:29,810 --> 03:39:31,170
That means next time.

3162
03:39:31,610 --> 03:39:36,030
That gives you an excuse to come back next time so you can
give her something, Arteus.

3163
03:39:36,410 --> 03:39:37,970
God, think with your brain.

3164
03:39:40,410 --> 03:39:41,590
Think, Arteus.

3165
03:39:42,170 --> 03:39:42,170
Think.

3166
03:39:45,130 --> 03:39:49,510
You don't have anything now, which means you can come back
and give her something later.

3167
03:39:52,750 --> 03:39:54,050
Because it's so smart.

3168
03:39:54,270 --> 03:39:54,870
I know.

3169
03:39:55,130 --> 03:39:55,530
Ask you something.

3170
03:39:56,050 --> 03:39:56,570
Of course.

3171
03:39:57,270 --> 03:39:58,610
Are you...

3172
03:39:58,610 --> 03:39:59,970
Are we...

3173
03:39:59,970 --> 03:40:01,190
The only giants left?

3174
03:40:01,190 --> 03:40:01,690
Oh, no.

3175
03:40:01,950 --> 03:40:02,470
Sort of.

3176
03:40:02,830 --> 03:40:03,830
It's complicated.

3177
03:40:03,830 --> 03:40:04,490
Wait, what?

3178
03:40:04,490 --> 03:40:04,990
I want to know.

3179
03:40:05,930 --> 03:40:07,710
It'll be much easier to just show up.

3180
03:40:07,770 --> 03:40:09,010
What about my prophecy then?

3181
03:40:09,310 --> 03:40:09,590
Wait.

3182
03:40:09,810 --> 03:40:10,530
If it is true...

3183
03:40:10,530 --> 03:40:12,050
We gotta continue the bloodline.

3184
03:40:12,190 --> 03:40:12,610
What do you think I should do?

3185
03:40:12,890 --> 03:40:13,630
Doesn't matter.

3186
03:40:14,090 --> 03:40:15,890
There's no changing where you end up.

3187
03:40:16,510 --> 03:40:19,550
You can try whatever you want to avoid it, but it'll happen
anyway.

3188
03:40:19,930 --> 03:40:22,630
You're telling me nobody has ever changed their fate?

3189
03:40:23,930 --> 03:40:24,030
Ever?

3190
03:40:24,510 --> 03:40:30,670
I mean, sure, maybe some details change, but the endpoint
remains the same.

3191
03:40:31,730 --> 03:40:34,130
It's better to walk your path than to struggle against it.

3192
03:40:36,990 --> 03:40:39,310
But then my papa dies.

3193
03:40:40,130 --> 03:40:41,310
I don't like that.

3194
03:40:41,950 --> 03:40:43,890
Wait, because, like, um...

3195
03:40:44,090 --> 03:40:47,510
Because Kratos saw that he was going to die anyway.

3196
03:40:47,870 --> 03:40:50,230
So that's why he wanted to spend more time with his son.

3197
03:40:51,450 --> 03:40:55,030
Oh, because he knows.

3198
03:40:59,540 --> 03:41:01,320
He knows his fate.

3199
03:41:03,100 --> 03:41:03,860
What's that?

3200
03:41:04,180 --> 03:41:04,560
A lift.

3201
03:41:05,140 --> 03:41:06,560
We'll have to leave Yala for a bit.

3202
03:41:08,660 --> 03:41:11,320
That's why he wanted to do the little side quest.

3203
03:41:20,380 --> 03:41:22,080
There's some gift.

3204
03:41:22,200 --> 03:41:28,200
doesn't seem like something you're excited about just means
we're coming up to the end what does that mean you'll

3205
03:41:28,200 --> 03:41:35,600
understand once we get there no does that mean no you're
real you won't disappear after it right your purpose can

3206
03:41:35,600 --> 03:41:41,220
even though your whole destiny wants to tell me this we can
still see each other right

3207
03:41:46,040 --> 03:41:53,600
now that's why he's trying to teach time to hold up my end
of the prophecy that's why he's trying to teach like him

3208
03:41:53,600 --> 03:41:55,360
everything before he goes

3209
03:41:59,000 --> 03:42:15,960
thousand i got another rune what is this oh i don't need
that that means i can upgrade okay yeah we gotta get that

3210
03:42:15,960 --> 03:42:38,000
okay oh that's why he's so harsh on him because he he's
trying and teach him as many lessons as he could before it's

3211
03:42:38,000 --> 03:42:38,880
too late.

3212
03:42:40,900 --> 03:42:41,340
Oh,

3213
03:42:45,900 --> 03:42:45,900
shit.

3214
03:42:46,100 --> 03:42:47,320
Yeah, that guy's dead, dead.

3215
03:42:53,100 --> 03:42:53,340
Oh, my gosh.

3216
03:42:53,500 --> 03:42:54,160
She's got my back.

3217
03:42:54,280 --> 03:42:54,720
Look at that.

3218
03:42:54,960 --> 03:42:56,480
She's already... Oh, my god.

3219
03:42:56,720 --> 03:42:56,720
Wait.

3220
03:42:59,440 --> 03:42:59,880
Goodbye.

3221
03:43:00,300 --> 03:43:01,060
Yeah, do you think that's...

3222
03:43:01,060 --> 03:43:01,400
Oh, wait.

3223
03:43:02,560 --> 03:43:03,920
I was like, is that overkill?

3224
03:43:04,420 --> 03:43:05,640
He's like, I live.

3225
03:43:10,970 --> 03:43:12,670
Like, fuck the wild, like.

3226
03:43:20,230 --> 03:43:22,730
Only I shall be the last bird.

3227
03:43:32,860 --> 03:43:35,420
Oh my gosh, she could like crush me right now with that
rock.

3228
03:43:39,420 --> 03:43:41,020
She could have easily killed me right there.

3229
03:43:41,300 --> 03:43:44,880
Now we know she's not lying.

3230
03:43:46,360 --> 03:43:48,120
She loves me for me.

3231
03:43:50,180 --> 03:43:51,020
That's good.

3232
03:43:51,800 --> 03:43:52,540
Now we know.

3233
03:43:53,020 --> 03:43:55,580
She's not here to actually kill me.

3234
03:43:56,640 --> 03:43:57,080
Oh,

3235
03:44:01,300 --> 03:44:01,800
yeah, you're right.

3236
03:44:01,960 --> 03:44:03,480
I quite lifted it myself, you know?

3237
03:44:03,580 --> 03:44:04,100
Uh-oh.

3238
03:44:06,360 --> 03:44:08,020
Yeah, I could have done that myself.

3239
03:44:09,760 --> 03:44:10,600
Or is it?

3240
03:44:11,000 --> 03:44:11,220
Oh.

3241
03:44:12,340 --> 03:44:12,960
Let's see.

3242
03:44:13,000 --> 03:44:13,600
Where is the...

3243
03:44:17,140 --> 03:44:18,020
Oh, shit!

3244
03:44:18,140 --> 03:44:18,940
I was like, where...

3245
03:44:18,940 --> 03:44:19,900
Oh, my God.

3246
03:44:19,960 --> 03:44:21,640
He's right above me, isn't he?

3247
03:44:21,880 --> 03:44:23,060
A fucking chorus.

3248
03:44:23,160 --> 03:44:24,560
I was like, what the fuck is the...

3249
03:44:24,580 --> 03:44:26,020
sound effects that I'm hearing.

3250
03:44:28,780 --> 03:44:30,120
I was so confused.

3251
03:44:39,260 --> 03:44:40,000
Wait, there's something.

3252
03:44:40,220 --> 03:44:41,460
I can go up here.

3253
03:44:43,080 --> 03:44:43,760
But how?

3254
03:44:45,620 --> 03:44:46,240
Oh, whatever.

3255
03:44:46,620 --> 03:44:47,760
I don't care that much.

3256
03:44:49,920 --> 03:44:52,260
Get you a girl that doesn't try to kill you.

3257
03:44:52,740 --> 03:44:54,420
We're coming up on the valley of the fallen.

3258
03:44:55,560 --> 03:44:56,940
What happened to them?

3259
03:44:57,180 --> 03:44:58,900
They were tired of living in fear of asking.

3260
03:44:58,920 --> 03:44:59,120
guard.

3261
03:44:59,860 --> 03:45:01,300
So they've hid.

3262
03:45:01,940 --> 03:45:02,920
That makes sense.

3263
03:45:03,200 --> 03:45:04,220
That's how the corpses to confuse Odin.

3264
03:45:04,520 --> 03:45:06,120
Should he ever find a way into Jotunheim?

3265
03:45:06,780 --> 03:45:07,360
Where'd they hide?

3266
03:45:07,720 --> 03:45:07,960
Yeah.

3267
03:45:08,620 --> 03:45:09,880
Wait, how did they all die?

3268
03:45:10,920 --> 03:45:14,900
If Odin never found him, how the fuck did they all die?

3269
03:45:25,570 --> 03:45:27,150
I got it.

3270
03:45:28,810 --> 03:45:30,810
He's like, yeah, I'm a strong independent woman.

3271
03:45:39,180 --> 03:45:39,580
Oh.

3272
03:45:43,720 --> 03:45:44,640
That's beautiful.

3273
03:45:44,740 --> 03:45:48,120
And his first date is going really well.

3274
03:45:54,340 --> 03:45:55,800
Oh, more marbles.

3275
03:45:56,660 --> 03:45:58,720
Wait, you've seen these before?

3276
03:45:59,800 --> 03:46:02,520
Not these, but I found a few in Midgard.

3277
03:46:02,860 --> 03:46:03,020
Where?

3278
03:46:04,240 --> 03:46:04,600
Huh?

3279
03:46:04,600 --> 03:46:05,340
Inside your mother's murals.

3280
03:46:09,040 --> 03:46:09,600
What?

3281
03:46:11,040 --> 03:46:11,820
What's that?

3282
03:46:11,860 --> 03:46:12,640
There's more out there.

3283
03:46:14,440 --> 03:46:14,740
Huh?

3284
03:46:14,860 --> 03:46:15,540
What are they?

3285
03:46:15,540 --> 03:46:18,760
just look

3286
03:46:25,850 --> 03:46:31,490
words Fiatzi

3287
03:46:37,560 --> 03:46:44,540

Am I in those plans?

3326
03:49:53,390 --> 03:49:55,190
It's over as far as the giants are concerned.

Maybe more?

3330
03:50:04,900 --> 03:50:11,480
Wait, so then like the one we found in Midgard, the other
giants figured out how to also put their souls into marbles.

3331
03:50:12,240 --> 03:50:13,120
Feel what?

Okay, that's good.

3354
03:51:25,440 --> 03:51:26,140

3365
03:51:57,080 --> 03:52:07,780
remains of the giants not all of them some are just missing
but where could they be nowhere in the nine realms as far as

3366
03:52:07,780 --> 03:52:13,540
anyone can tell because odin wants to kill all the giants so
that the prophecy doesn't go foretoed so then that means i'm

3367
03:52:13,540 --> 03:52:24,060
gonna bring the out of the marbles like a pokeball I'm like
oh giants go so I can actually so I can like make like bring

3368
03:52:24,060 --> 03:52:38,740
the prophecy to life see guys I can retain information I
follow through because I need the giants for the prophecy

3369
03:52:38,740 --> 03:52:48,800
far up past those rocks there's a sinkhole that's where
we're headed we should something on your mind nobody

3370
03:52:48,800 --> 03:52:57,320

Loki you can't tell anyone about Ironwood not even your

3371
03:52:57,320 --> 03:53:03,580
father the biggest thing keeping this place safe is that
Odin's not I did it my wards can keep the wildlife at bay

3372
03:53:03,580 --> 03:53:14,740
but if Asgard ever came looking I get it I'm sorry I won't
tell anyone they want to hear it because he was supposed to

3373
03:53:14,740 --> 03:53:24,200
lead the army of giants see see i remember i remember the

What if it's, what if he's delicious?

3383

Lots of creatures in it.

run them out your paint supplies are important if that's

Oh, I...

03:54:44,600 --> 03:54:44,700
Aww.

3394
03:54:45,320 --> 03:54:46,480
But, uh...

3395
03:54:46,480 --> 03:54:47,100
Ah!

3396
03:54:48,060 --> 03:54:48,460
Hang on.

3397
03:54:49,040 --> 03:54:50,200
We're looking for wretch nests.

3398
03:54:50,940 --> 03:54:53,820
Those will give me the supplies I need, so keep an eye out.

3399
03:55:07,180 --> 03:55:08,860
I'm okay.

3400
03:55:12,320 --> 03:55:15,120
I showed her my wolf.

3401
03:55:17,680 --> 03:55:19,360
And that's...

3402
03:55:19,360 --> 03:55:20,780
And it's already over.

3403
03:55:22,000 --> 03:55:23,300
What's the point?

3404
03:55:24,200 --> 03:55:27,460
What's the point of showing her the wolf inside me?

3405
03:55:28,700 --> 03:55:31,740
If she won't even accept my flower.

3406
03:55:32,800 --> 03:55:33,520
It's over.

3407
03:55:33,860 --> 03:55:34,800
I knew it!

3408
03:55:35,620 --> 03:55:36,960
They're all the same.

3409
03:55:37,500 --> 03:55:39,300
The first woman I met.

3410
03:55:41,220 --> 03:55:43,780
We're literally the last remaining giants.

3411
03:55:47,640 --> 03:55:48,340
Wretches.

3412
03:55:48,640 --> 03:55:49,260
A nest of them.

3413
03:55:49,620 --> 03:55:50,660
They're everywhere down here.

3414
03:55:51,540 --> 03:55:52,040
Can't.

3415
03:55:52,060 --> 03:55:52,700
Literally.

3416
03:55:53,920 --> 03:55:54,600
Literally.

3417
03:55:55,560 --> 03:55:56,680
There were the only two.

3418
03:55:56,780 --> 03:55:59,100
Like, I was part of her destiny.

3419
03:55:59,720 --> 03:56:01,380
And she already.

3420
03:56:02,680 --> 03:56:05,380
She already doesn't want me to.

3421
03:56:05,620 --> 03:56:06,040
What?

3422
03:56:06,140 --> 03:56:07,880
I'm out and grab what I need from them.

3423
03:56:08,340 --> 03:56:08,940
Let's do it.

3424
03:56:09,100 --> 03:56:11,440
If you leave, I'll light the torches.

3425
03:56:12,060 --> 03:56:13,000
What's the point?

3426
03:56:13,660 --> 03:56:14,540
Where do I lead?

3427
03:56:16,180 --> 03:56:17,000
I got this one.

3428
03:56:17,120 --> 03:56:17,940
Like this one?

3429
03:56:18,100 --> 03:56:18,580
Oh wait, look.

3430
03:56:21,900 --> 03:56:23,640
Like, what's the point?

3431
03:56:25,920 --> 03:56:26,920
Stop doing.

3432
03:56:33,240 --> 03:56:34,840
I'm so sad.

3433
03:56:37,520 --> 03:56:45,360
i thought i thought we were supposed to be like our destiny
was supposed to imply you know

3434
03:56:49,710 --> 03:56:54,410

3435
03:57:06,870 --> 03:57:14,290

3436
03:57:20,880 --> 03:57:37,580

3437
03:57:39,060 --> 03:57:42,140
Oh my god Oh my god that was not all of them

3438
03:57:45,680 --> 03:57:47,100
What the fuck is the next?

3439
03:57:47,120 --> 03:57:49,280
A little bit of this, a little bit of that.

3440
03:57:54,300 --> 03:57:56,960
Oh my god, it's above me.

3441
03:57:58,360 --> 03:58:00,080
It was above me.

3442
03:58:00,740 --> 03:58:02,620
I was like, where the fuck is it?

3443
03:58:04,040 --> 03:58:05,040
Now to find the rest.

3444
03:58:07,800 --> 03:58:09,680
Star Ace, thank you for the super chat.

3445
03:58:09,920 --> 03:58:10,740
Thank you, thank you.

3446
03:58:14,170 --> 03:58:15,970
His first heartbreak.

3447
03:58:19,210 --> 03:58:21,530
I'm sorry, Arteus.

3448
03:58:21,790 --> 03:58:22,670
It's kind of funky.

3449
03:58:23,550 --> 03:58:25,350
We have to be so vulnerable.

3450
03:58:31,210 --> 03:58:33,190
Okay, obviously we can't go there.

3451
03:58:34,530 --> 03:58:36,750
I'm always worried I'm like missing loot.

3452
03:58:39,710 --> 03:58:41,350
Tokey has such negative risk.

3453
03:58:41,650 --> 03:58:44,490
She needs prophecy to get a woman.

3454
03:58:44,990 --> 03:58:46,710
It doesn't even work.

3455
03:58:47,090 --> 03:58:51,790
She was destined to meet me and she still doesn't want to be
with me.

3456
03:59:02,490 --> 03:59:06,510
it's so hard not to get lost in here right yeah we're fine

3457
03:59:10,470 --> 03:59:29,030
what the fuck where the fuck did she fucking go oh shit how

Yeah, this is a dead end.

3468
04:00:14,810 --> 04:00:15,270
This way?

3469
04:00:17,090 --> 04:00:18,430
God, I'm so lost.

3470
04:00:22,130 --> 04:00:24,910
These tunnels are fucking hard to navigate.

04:00:26,730 --> 04:00:29,390

3475
04:00:36,730 --> 04:00:37,390
Oh, I looped.

04:00:40,070 --> 04:00:41,310
Okay, it's this way.

3477
04:00:42,710 --> 04:00:44,290
And then it's this way.

04:00:46,990 --> 04:00:48,030

04:00:52,910 --> 04:00:55,910
Maybe, like, later on, like, you know...

3482
04:00:55,910 --> 04:00:57,630
These nests aren't just out here.

3483
04:00:57,850 --> 04:00:58,330
Damn it.

3484
04:00:59,470 --> 04:01:00,130

04:01:00,490 --> 04:01:01,550
Where's the nest?

3486
04:01:03,930 --> 04:01:05,650
Can't you guys just leave us alone?

3487
04:01:05,770 --> 04:01:06,110

3488
04:01:08,870 --> 04:01:10,550
Okay, I've done a shortcut.

There you go.

3495
04:01:31,730 --> 04:01:32,630

we can bring the animals over.

3499
04:02:12,010 --> 04:02:12,770
It's okay.

3500
04:02:13,030 --> 04:02:14,450
The animals can come with us.

3501
04:02:16,550 --> 04:02:17,350
It's okay.

3502
04:02:23,760 --> 04:02:25,860
I think there's another one nearby.

3503
04:02:26,560 --> 04:02:27,440

3504
04:02:30,660 --> 04:02:31,140

It's almost down.

3512
04:02:54,750 --> 04:02:57,530
Oh my god, there's like one tiny baby that came out of it.

3513
04:02:58,830 --> 04:03:00,150

He was bound to be mad.

3529
04:04:25,110 --> 04:04:25,970
We destroyed their nest.

3530
04:04:26,170 --> 04:04:26,850
All right, that's fine.

3531
04:04:27,650 --> 04:04:28,370
Wolf time.

04:12:18,230 --> 04:12:21,350
Does that mean blind people have no souls?

3634
04:12:21,910 --> 04:12:25,590
It doesn't mean you have what her there's a gorilla on the
loose.

3635
04:12:26,310 --> 04:12:28,850
It's just like gingers.

3636
04:12:32,570 --> 04:12:34,210
Is that what she's implying?

3637
04:12:44,280 --> 04:12:45,500
Another one?

3638
04:12:45,680 --> 04:12:46,060

3639
04:12:52,650 --> 04:12:53,010

3653
04:15:03,830 --> 04:15:04,810
It's just a little guys now

3654
04:15:13,160 --> 04:15:14,720
That's fine let them explode.

3655
04:15:16,300 --> 04:15:19,520
I don't need a dwarf finisher Actually, I do.

3656
04:15:20,280 --> 04:15:20,720
Yeah

3657
04:15:24,090 --> 04:15:31,190
Did a lot of giants live here over time you want to know
about your mother she lived this entire life before she had

3658
04:15:31,190 --> 04:15:37,430
me But I don't know anything about it How did she even meet
Kratos?

3659
04:15:38,090 --> 04:15:41,110
Your mother left the path of the giants way before I was
born.

3660
04:15:51,530 --> 04:15:52,650
Alright, nice.

3661
04:15:52,870 --> 04:15:54,410
Oh nice, more free stuff.

3662
04:15:56,270 --> 04:15:56,810
Fighting?

3663
04:15:57,730 --> 04:15:59,250
I mean, he is the god of war.

3664
04:15:59,550 --> 04:16:00,210
In a battle?

3665
04:16:01,230 --> 04:16:02,370
This is Grel's home.

3666
04:16:02,970 --> 04:16:03,530
No lights.

3667
04:16:04,110 --> 04:16:07,030
She may still be checking her traps, but she might have more
animals inside.

3668
04:16:07,590 --> 04:16:08,450
We have to be quick.

3669
04:16:11,490 --> 04:16:11,930
Violence.

3670
04:16:12,210 --> 04:16:12,430
Ah.

3671
04:16:13,250 --> 04:16:14,590
The perfect way.

3672
04:16:15,650 --> 04:16:17,310
Kratos was like, John, woman.

3673
04:16:22,940 --> 04:16:24,040
There's another way in.

3674
04:16:24,160 --> 04:16:24,520
Up there.

3675
04:16:25,020 --> 04:16:26,800
We'll have to figure out how to get to it.

3676
04:16:33,460 --> 04:16:34,340
Puzzle time.

3677
04:16:36,280 --> 04:16:37,320
Oh, there it is.

3678
04:16:37,580 --> 04:16:37,980
Never mind.

3679
04:16:38,100 --> 04:16:39,520
Not really a puzzle.

3680
04:16:40,020 --> 04:16:41,140
White paint time.

3681
04:16:42,420 --> 04:16:45,660
Maybe there's a way up on the other side, but I won't be
able to get across.

3682
04:16:49,360 --> 04:16:50,460
It's not here?

3683
04:16:52,820 --> 04:16:53,280
Okay.

3684
04:16:56,340 --> 04:16:57,820
Is there something I can shoot from here?

3685
04:17:05,180 --> 04:17:07,200
Oh, I don't fucking know.

3686
04:17:10,440 --> 04:17:11,400
I'm looking.

3687
04:17:13,120 --> 04:17:14,080
I'm looking...

3688
04:17:14,080 --> 04:17:16,340
Oh my god, it's tiny green shit.

3689
04:17:17,280 --> 04:17:17,480
No.

3690
04:17:22,520 --> 04:17:26,840
It was like the faintest green I've ever seen.

3691
04:17:29,460 --> 04:17:32,760
So, Gryla, what does she need animal souls for anyway?

3692
04:17:33,440 --> 04:17:35,640
She can live moments from their lives.

3693
04:17:36,700 --> 04:17:37,900
What the fuck?

3694
04:17:38,700 --> 04:17:40,540
Bro, she's micro-dosing.

3695
04:17:41,300 --> 04:17:42,300
Oh, no.

3696
04:17:45,540 --> 04:17:47,160
But it's not real.

3697
04:17:49,200 --> 04:17:50,880
We gotta take her to rehab.

3698
04:17:54,200 --> 04:17:54,960
Oh, no.

3699
04:17:55,960 --> 04:17:57,440
Your grandma's an addict.

3700
04:17:57,740 --> 04:17:59,180
She's chasing the hot.

3701
04:18:01,480 --> 04:18:01,880
Oh, God.

3702
04:18:02,080 --> 04:18:03,720
Take your granny to rehab.

3703
04:18:09,780 --> 04:18:10,360
Oh, shit.

3704
04:18:11,940 --> 04:18:13,320
She won't hear this, right?

3705
04:18:13,440 --> 04:18:14,320
Ryl is still out.

3706
04:18:14,700 --> 04:18:14,920
Wow.

3707
04:18:15,420 --> 04:18:16,660
The things are so big.

3708
04:18:16,980 --> 04:18:17,740
Oh, my God.

3709
04:18:18,120 --> 04:18:18,260
Whoa.

3710
04:18:18,780 --> 04:18:20,280
There's a door to the cellar over here.

3711
04:18:21,320 --> 04:18:22,600
truly is a giant woman.

3712
04:18:29,420 --> 04:18:30,640
Are they here?

3713
04:18:32,440 --> 04:18:34,960
That's just lore stuff.

3714
04:18:36,260 --> 04:18:36,680
I assume?

3715
04:18:43,240 --> 04:18:44,420
The key's already in the log.

3716
04:18:44,940 --> 04:18:46,100
Just gotta turn it.

3717
04:18:47,860 --> 04:18:48,160
Eh.

3718
04:18:49,640 --> 04:18:50,300
Jesus.

3719
04:18:51,340 --> 04:18:53,920
Wait, does that mean she's gonna grow that big too?

3720
04:18:54,660 --> 04:18:56,540
If her grandma was was this big.

3721
04:18:56,780 --> 04:18:58,280
I mean, she has to be this big.

3722
04:18:59,460 --> 04:19:01,560
Just haven't hit a growth spurt yet.

3723
04:19:11,020 --> 04:19:11,780
Makes sense.

3724
04:19:15,690 --> 04:19:16,650
Oh, I can't go back.

3725
04:19:16,810 --> 04:19:18,410
Well, I hope I got all the loot there.

3726
04:19:21,570 --> 04:19:22,370
Holy shit.

3727
04:19:22,610 --> 04:19:25,950
Even this is like there's a big ass staircase.

3728
04:19:29,910 --> 04:19:33,010
I definitely like playing Arteus more than Kratos.

3729
04:19:33,430 --> 04:19:34,410
I'm breathing near the back of the cellar.

3730
04:19:34,830 --> 04:19:35,510
Me too.

3731
04:19:35,970 --> 04:19:37,070
I'm not hearing their voice.

3732
04:19:39,270 --> 04:19:40,730
I just... I think the bow...

3733
04:19:40,730 --> 04:19:42,490
I like the bow mechanic a lot more.

3734
04:19:42,890 --> 04:19:43,510
For sure.

3735
04:20:01,530 --> 04:20:02,050
Yeah.

3736
04:20:03,730 --> 04:20:05,430
Yes, he has pew pew.

3737
04:20:05,690 --> 04:20:06,250
And yeah?

3738
04:20:07,510 --> 04:20:09,210
I need to find a way back there.

3739
04:20:10,470 --> 04:20:10,910
Yeah.

3740
04:20:11,590 --> 04:20:12,610
I like pew pew.

3741
04:20:12,890 --> 04:20:13,690
What can I say?

3742
04:20:14,470 --> 04:20:15,510
Pew pew is fun.

3743
04:20:16,590 --> 04:20:17,570
Pew pew is life.

3744
04:20:30,220 --> 04:20:31,140
Alright, nice.

3745
04:20:31,660 --> 04:20:32,440
we got money.

3746
04:20:38,930 --> 04:20:40,630
Oh, it has that money too.

3747
04:20:41,210 --> 04:20:42,630
This is giant money.

3748
04:21:05,440 --> 04:21:07,120
The only Kratos had a gun.

3749
04:21:08,020 --> 04:21:09,760
In this game would be perfect.

3750
04:21:11,360 --> 04:21:12,880
Oh, it's a snake.

3751
04:21:14,120 --> 04:21:14,220
Oh.

3752
04:21:14,420 --> 04:21:14,580
Oh.

3753
04:21:14,580 --> 04:21:15,240
She took it, soul.

3754
04:21:17,320 --> 04:21:19,060
There's not much more we can do.

3755
04:21:20,400 --> 04:21:23,500
Can we not like bring, give him the soul back?

3756
04:21:25,620 --> 04:21:26,220
Oh.

3757
04:21:28,860 --> 04:21:30,060
Hold this.

3758
04:21:32,720 --> 04:21:33,440
What are you?

3759
04:21:33,620 --> 04:21:36,120
You didn't have a least favorite giant.

3760
04:21:36,980 --> 04:21:37,220
Did you?

3761
04:21:37,360 --> 04:21:39,640
What the fuck?

3762
04:21:40,120 --> 04:21:41,200
Never mind.

3763
04:21:42,420 --> 04:21:44,620
I'm gonna put a s- No.

3764
04:21:46,040 --> 04:21:48,300
Your mother said I'd know what to do with this.

3765
04:21:48,600 --> 04:21:49,140
Eventually.

3766
04:21:49,880 --> 04:21:51,060
I just gave them to you.

3767
04:21:51,380 --> 04:21:51,840
I know.

3768
04:21:52,800 --> 04:21:54,700
He's like, we're back.

3769
04:21:55,640 --> 04:22:05,220
my legs right imagine you guys just woke up you're like what

3772
04:22:38,060 --> 04:22:39,620
I don't know, man.

3773
04:22:40,040 --> 04:22:43,360
I know you love animals, but not everyone loves animals.

3774
04:22:49,470 --> 04:22:49,810
Beck yeah.

3775
04:22:54,260 --> 04:22:55,020
Beck yeah.

3776
04:22:55,580 --> 04:22:55,980
Beck yeah.

3777
04:22:59,770 --> 04:23:01,590
Oh, is this the world serpent?

3778
04:23:11,060 --> 04:23:13,180
Oh, so they gave birth to the world serpent.

3779
04:23:13,320 --> 04:23:16,860
You're like, where'd my legs and arms go?

3780
04:23:17,580 --> 04:23:18,280
That's it?

3781
04:23:18,280 --> 04:23:21,960
You got turned into a giant snake and where's it going?

3782
04:23:22,140 --> 04:23:22,620
Does that even work?

3783
04:23:23,460 --> 04:23:24,260
I don't know.

3784
04:23:25,700 --> 04:23:26,860
We're safe.

3785
04:23:27,400 --> 04:23:30,540
I was like, bro, you got turned into a giant snake.

3786
04:23:31,120 --> 04:23:33,480
Like, that's how you're gonna react.

3787
04:23:33,940 --> 04:23:35,060
But you're giving up already?

3788
04:23:36,340 --> 04:23:37,260
They're your responsibility.

3789
04:23:37,540 --> 04:23:37,840
It's not that.

3790
04:23:39,420 --> 04:23:40,480
And he's out.

3791
04:23:40,600 --> 04:23:41,120
It's not.

3792
04:23:44,420 --> 04:23:49,520
I just think they're better off with you.

3793
04:23:50,380 --> 04:23:53,760
Bro, he's just gonna put it in random animals.

3794
04:23:55,560 --> 04:23:57,780
I guess I'm a snake now.

3795
04:23:58,480 --> 04:23:59,620
Are you certain?

3796
04:24:04,280 --> 04:24:05,100
Call me, Atreus.

3797
04:24:09,940 --> 04:24:10,320
Okay.

3798
04:24:13,060 --> 04:24:14,820
Yeah, but he used to be a giant.

3799
04:24:14,820 --> 04:24:15,500
It's his whole.

3800
04:24:17,480 --> 04:24:17,900
Oh.

3801
04:24:18,340 --> 04:24:20,500
Oh my god, he just returned her gift.

3802
04:24:20,980 --> 04:24:21,720
Let's get back.

3803
04:24:22,280 --> 04:24:24,080
That's fucking crazy.

04:24:24,580 --> 04:24:24,660
I'm sorry.

I just...

3806
04:24:25,440 --> 04:24:26,440
We'll have to get out the same way.

Okay, she is, like, not letting me see anything.

3884
04:31:26,570 --> 04:31:29,750
She's not letting me get close to her at all.

3885
04:31:34,210 --> 04:31:36,630

Okay, we're fine, we're fine, we're fine.

3902
04:33:11,300 --> 04:33:12,720
I have to be so locked in!

3903
04:33:13,300 --> 04:33:14,160
Oh, fuck!

3904
04:33:16,040 --> 04:33:18,300
Guys, did you think I was really locked in?

3905
04:33:18,780 --> 04:33:20,780
Oh my god, god damn it.

3906
04:33:23,200 --> 04:33:24,500
I messed up.

3907
04:33:29,950 --> 04:33:32,030
Okay, that has to be close enough, right?

3908
04:33:33,850 --> 04:33:34,490
Nice.

3909
04:33:37,130 --> 04:33:37,570
Oh, wait!

3910
04:33:39,170 --> 04:33:39,430
Yeah!

3911
04:33:42,070 --> 04:33:44,350
Okay, okay, it's fine, it's fine.

3912
04:33:49,010 --> 04:33:50,490
I'm so alive.

3913
04:33:52,990 --> 04:33:54,490
And circle!

3914
04:33:57,150 --> 04:34:00,850
It's like she's a giant or something!

3915
04:34:01,410 --> 04:34:03,210
Let's go!

3916
04:34:07,690 --> 04:34:08,150
Yes!

3917
04:34:12,370 --> 04:34:13,910
That's right, Grandma.

3918
04:34:14,750 --> 04:34:18,430
This is an intervention and you have a problem.

3919
04:34:19,970 --> 04:34:21,150
I saved you.

3920
04:34:29,280 --> 04:34:34,220
I should have thrown you to the woods right after I pulled
you out of your mother.

3921
04:34:34,500 --> 04:34:35,340
I don't mean that.

3922
04:34:36,260 --> 04:34:36,660
Get out.

3923
04:34:38,440 --> 04:34:38,880
I just...

3924
04:34:38,880 --> 04:34:39,500
Get out!

3925
04:34:41,040 --> 04:34:41,200
No.

3926
04:34:43,180 --> 04:34:45,740
Also, I hope the mom was just as big as her.

3927
04:34:46,800 --> 04:34:49,760
Oh my gosh, she must have been a really fucking tiny babe.

3928
04:34:50,120 --> 04:34:51,020
Wait, what?

3929
04:34:52,120 --> 04:34:53,540
How does that work?

3930
04:34:53,740 --> 04:34:55,660
You think you've done something here?

3931
04:34:55,900 --> 04:35:11,920
granddaughter you are nothing and no one will ever remember
you not even Loki you'll just be a forgotten chapter in his

3932
04:35:11,920 --> 04:35:27,180
story oh he'll be too busy mourning his father he doesn't
mean that I see you again you You wish you died with your

3933
04:35:27,180 --> 04:35:27,760
parents.

3934
04:35:27,880 --> 04:35:29,440
Jesus Christ!

3935
04:35:30,020 --> 04:35:31,620
How is she not crying?

3936
04:35:33,400 --> 04:35:34,500
I'd be like...

3937
04:35:39,180 --> 04:35:41,000
Oh my God!

3938
04:35:42,260 --> 04:35:44,040
What if she comes out looking for it?

3939
04:35:44,040 --> 04:35:45,360
She used to leave me food?

3940
04:35:47,820 --> 04:35:48,100
What?

3941
04:35:50,140 --> 04:35:52,300
She'd say she didn't care about me.

3942
04:35:54,040 --> 04:35:55,880
Sometimes I'd wake up and...

3943
04:35:56,560 --> 04:35:59,900
I'd see a loaf of bread sitting next to the fire.

3944
04:36:01,420 --> 04:36:04,900
Just bake just the way she always used to.

3945
04:36:09,910 --> 04:36:10,990
That's drama, right?

3946
04:36:11,010 --> 04:36:12,510
She's not a monster, you know?

3947
04:36:13,510 --> 04:36:14,970
She still has her old cell.

3948
04:36:15,590 --> 04:36:16,490
She's lost.

3949
04:36:17,030 --> 04:36:17,270
Aww.

3950
04:36:18,410 --> 04:36:18,410
You

3951
04:36:23,910 --> 04:36:25,790
want to walk?

3952
04:36:30,130 --> 04:36:30,730
Aww.

3953
04:36:34,120 --> 04:36:35,520
We both fucked up.

3954
04:36:37,720 --> 04:36:38,840
It's okay with you.

3955
04:36:38,860 --> 04:36:41,540
We can heal from the trauma together.

3956
04:36:49,800 --> 04:36:50,480
Aww.

3957
04:36:53,380 --> 04:36:56,920
All this because of Jada's soul's addiction.

3958
04:36:57,140 --> 04:37:00,940
I just, we just want, we want, we care about her.

3959
04:37:01,020 --> 04:37:02,020
It was an intervention.

3960
04:37:03,740 --> 04:37:04,280
Holy shit.

3961
04:37:14,840 --> 04:37:15,460
You had a three?

3962
04:37:16,640 --> 04:37:17,120
Atreus.

3963
04:37:17,600 --> 04:37:18,200
Race me.

3964
04:37:18,320 --> 04:37:18,820
Come on.

3965
04:37:19,140 --> 04:37:20,240
I see what you're doing.

3966
04:37:20,440 --> 04:37:21,940
You know you want a rematch after last time.

3967
04:37:22,100 --> 04:37:22,620
I appreciate.

3968
04:37:23,200 --> 04:37:26,180
Um, last time I beat you.

3969
04:37:26,580 --> 04:37:28,380
I'm pretty sure we'll be tired.

3970
04:37:28,920 --> 04:37:29,820
Pretty sure it wasn't.

3971
04:37:29,820 --> 04:37:30,260
Aww.

3972
04:37:31,040 --> 04:37:32,340
I'm gonna try and cheer up.

3973
04:37:33,480 --> 04:37:34,700
We're trauma bonding.

3974
04:37:34,820 --> 04:37:35,380
We are.

3975
04:37:37,620 --> 04:37:38,520
So prove me wrong.

3976
04:37:39,300 --> 04:37:39,980
One, two, three, go!

3977
04:37:40,480 --> 04:37:40,800
Fine.

3978
04:37:42,420 --> 04:37:44,500
Yeah, no, that girl definitely needs a hug.

3979
04:37:44,840 --> 04:37:46,160

That's right.

3984
04:37:53,160 --> 04:37:56,000
I thought I can control my wealth.

3985
04:37:57,840 --> 04:38:00,600
I have absolutely no idea what you're saying.

3986
04:38:02,020 --> 04:38:04,560
This field always looks so amazing.

3987
04:38:06,700 --> 04:38:08,000
But it's beautiful.

3988
04:38:08,020 --> 04:38:09,740

04:38:10,040 --> 04:38:10,960

I walked past the gate.

4049
04:41:56,760 --> 04:41:57,660

4069
04:44:26,930 --> 04:44:28,250
To lose a parent.

4070
04:44:29,710 --> 04:44:30,490
That's my mom.

4071
04:44:30,770 --> 04:44:31,410
To lose both.

4072
04:44:35,120 --> 04:44:37,340
Your mother may be gone, but your father...

4073
04:44:39,660 --> 04:44:41,260
You've still got time.

4074
04:44:44,100 --> 04:44:45,600
To say goodbye.

4075
04:44:49,840 --> 04:44:50,920

4076
04:44:52,820 --> 04:44:54,200

4079
04:45:06,100 --> 04:45:09,080

4084
04:45:53,250 --> 04:45:53,450

You can do whatever you want now.

4089
04:46:00,010 --> 04:46:01,090
Oh, my God, we're so close.

4090
04:46:02,330 --> 04:46:02,930
No idea.

4091
04:46:08,270 --> 04:46:10,250
I can't just sit back and let my dad die.

4092
04:46:18,590 --> 04:46:19,590
I gotta get back.

4093
04:46:21,810 --> 04:46:22,170

No.

4101
04:46:36,590 --> 04:46:37,450
You just are.

I am gonna see you again.

4103
04:46:49,320 --> 04:46:50,080
Sure.

4104
04:46:54,270 --> 04:46:54,990
Okay, now.

4105
04:46:57,450 --> 04:46:58,490
Close your eyes.

4106
04:46:59,970 --> 04:47:01,150
And hold that tight.

4107
04:47:01,290 --> 04:47:12,810

Whoops.

4112
04:48:01,240 --> 04:48:03,500
He didn't update his address.

4113
04:48:17,290 --> 04:48:18,050
Oh,

4114
04:48:24,470 --> 04:48:26,710

4115
04:48:27,110 --> 04:48:28,050
Oh, fuck!

4116
04:48:33,860 --> 04:48:36,060
He slept in the wrong bed in Minecraft.

4117
04:48:38,820 --> 04:48:40,720
Yeah, instructions are great.

4118
04:48:42,560 --> 04:48:43,480
Oh, shit.

Yeah, he forgot to reset his spawn, bro.

4122
04:48:56,500 --> 04:48:57,840
Don't you hate it when that happens?

4123
04:49:00,680 --> 04:49:02,400
Whoops I ran the wrong way.

4124
04:49:03,020 --> 04:49:06,680
Oh my gosh, and I don't even have my fucking, I don't have
my wolf.

4125
04:49:07,960 --> 04:49:09,520
I can't leash the beast.

4126
04:49:21,360 --> 04:49:27,540
Alright, fuck it, let's do it.

4127
04:49:29,040 --> 04:49:31,420
Alright, let's get this guy out of here.

4128

Father.

4132
04:49:38,200 --> 04:49:40,940
And I gotta keep Ironwood and Anger Voter a secret somehow.

4133
04:49:41,780 --> 04:49:42,060
Oh.

4134
04:49:42,120 --> 04:49:43,260
What did I get myself into?

4135
04:49:43,660 --> 04:49:46,220

04:50:38,280 --> 04:50:39,340
But you don't believe in any of it.

4145

And still, I follow.

4146
04:50:41,480 --> 04:50:43,680
Because all that matters is that you are safe.

4147
04:50:43,940 --> 04:50:45,060
But that's not all that matters.

4148
04:50:45,800 --> 04:50:47,840

04:51:40,400 --> 04:51:42,280
Okay, now is the time I use fire.

04:54:40,200 --> 04:54:40,900
It's just a cutscene.

4199
04:54:41,100 --> 04:54:43,220

04:54:53,860 --> 04:54:56,400
Every violation imaginable.

04:54:59,720 --> 04:55:01,120
Oh, shit!

4206
04:55:03,380 --> 04:55:04,100

4209
04:55:10,840 --> 04:55:11,080
Petraeus!

4210
04:55:11,100 --> 04:55:12,200
Control your rage!

4211
04:55:13,560 --> 04:55:18,480
That was Patchwish.

4212
04:55:18,680 --> 04:55:19,200
That was Freya?

4213
04:55:19,660 --> 04:55:21,100
She was our friend.

4214
04:55:29,220 --> 04:55:31,160
My bear son.

4215
04:55:36,340 --> 04:55:37,730
I'm strong as fuck.

4216
04:55:37,890 --> 04:55:39,130
I just wrestled a bear.

4217
04:55:45,820 --> 04:55:47,640
Control your furry son.

4218
04:55:50,000 --> 04:55:55,100
Oh, she realized she's a monster now.

4219
04:55:56,640 --> 04:55:57,680
It's after all that.

4220
04:56:01,300 --> 04:56:01,420
Oh!

4221
04:56:17,240 --> 04:56:18,080
Maybe.

4222
04:56:20,600 --> 04:56:22,040
For the moment.

4223
04:56:24,460 --> 04:56:26,740
You are of more use to me.

4224
04:56:28,780 --> 04:56:29,200
Alive.

4225
04:56:29,720 --> 04:56:29,980
Oh.

4226
04:56:31,160 --> 04:56:32,060
Did it.

4227
04:56:32,440 --> 04:56:33,660
We're friends again.

4228
04:56:34,980 --> 04:56:35,580
Yay!

4229
04:56:36,840 --> 04:56:37,580
That's right.

4230
04:56:38,600 --> 04:56:38,820
Home.

4231
04:56:40,500 --> 04:56:41,100
Home.

4232
04:56:42,100 --> 04:56:42,100
Really?

4233
04:56:42,640 --> 04:56:44,580
You will tell the truth when I return.

4234
04:56:45,100 --> 04:56:46,120
Now I must set things right.

4235
04:56:46,800 --> 04:56:47,400
Um...

4236
04:56:48,300 --> 04:56:49,340
We'll take him.

4237
04:56:50,260 --> 04:56:50,440
Oh.

4238
04:56:51,340 --> 04:56:52,220
Your Majesty.

4239
04:56:53,560 --> 04:56:55,500
A pleasure to see you again.

4240
04:56:57,920 --> 04:56:58,520
Bronifer.

4241
04:57:01,660 --> 04:57:03,440
Do not let him out of your sight.

4242
04:57:04,420 --> 04:57:06,020
You heard him, sunshine.

4243
04:57:06,580 --> 04:57:07,880
Come on, get a move on.

4244
04:57:08,000 --> 04:57:09,360
You killed her last son.

4245
04:57:09,620 --> 04:57:10,860
You owe her another one.

4246
04:57:11,100 --> 04:57:12,600
What is this, Hollow Knight?

4247
04:57:16,420 --> 04:57:17,580
What is it?

4248
04:57:17,660 --> 04:57:18,020
What is it you want?

4249
04:57:19,640 --> 04:57:21,460
We're gonna make Silk Sun.

4250
04:57:21,660 --> 04:57:23,120
I have feelings to remain bound to this realm.

4251
04:57:25,920 --> 04:57:27,260
We travel to Vanaheim.

4252
04:57:28,800 --> 04:57:31,360
Well, guess it's just us, then.

4253
04:57:37,200 --> 04:57:39,260
We're gonna make silkside.

4254
04:57:40,660 --> 04:57:43,550
One gateway to Vannaheim Coming right up.

4255
04:57:45,340 --> 04:57:47,060
Valor uses rage to You're right.

4256
04:57:47,400 --> 04:57:47,860
So that...

4257
04:57:47,860 --> 04:57:50,560
I'd rather use rage to To fight.

4258
04:57:52,620 --> 04:57:53,800
No, fuck that.

4259
04:57:54,120 --> 04:57:56,340
I'm fucking raging to fight.

4260
04:57:57,060 --> 04:57:58,440
Bro, what the fuck?

4261
04:57:59,380 --> 04:58:00,460
Well, I'm angry.

4262
04:58:00,940 --> 04:58:03,060
I'm not gonna use it to You're like a pussy.

4263
04:58:04,140 --> 04:58:05,680
I ain't no pussy.

4264
04:58:07,340 --> 04:58:08,600
Oh shit, I want to fucking...

4265
04:58:08,600 --> 04:58:09,520
I want that armor.

4266
04:58:09,700 --> 04:58:10,480
What the fuck?

4267
04:58:13,590 --> 04:58:14,630
Upgrade this later.

4268
04:58:17,510 --> 04:58:18,990
They're ready for strength?

4269
04:58:19,350 --> 04:58:20,530
That shit is fire.

4270
04:58:22,550 --> 04:58:23,590
More strength.

4271
04:58:34,420 --> 04:58:35,300
I haven't unlocked.

4272
04:58:35,460 --> 04:58:36,680
I should have unlocked the axis.

4273
04:58:36,880 --> 04:58:37,100
Yeah?

4274
04:58:37,260 --> 04:58:38,600
Yeah, I knew it.

4275
04:58:44,700 --> 04:58:46,280
Switch by pausing?

4276
04:58:46,520 --> 04:58:47,340
Who pauses?

4277
04:58:52,620 --> 04:58:54,100
Yeah, sure, I'll do that.

4278
04:59:15,390 --> 04:59:16,530
I have anything new here?

4279
04:59:21,410 --> 04:59:23,030
Yeah, imagine not mashing.

4280
04:59:23,550 --> 04:59:23,930
Exactly!

04:59:28,790 --> 04:59:31,170
Alright, oh, do I have any new relics or anything?

04:59:31,310 --> 04:59:32,670
Oh yeah, this one I just put on.

You are still bound, how will you travel?

4284
04:59:35,130 --> 04:59:38,470
I crafted a protection ward that'll keep me from being
pulled out of the realm.

4285
04:59:39,050 --> 04:59:41,010
It should hold until I find what I need.

4286
04:59:41,590 --> 04:59:42,430
And what is that?

4287
04:59:44,510 --> 04:59:55,190

help you but it will not change what I have done I know all

05:02:39,290 --> 05:02:41,310
Oh, my God.

4295
05:02:42,110 --> 05:02:46,330
Like, I was not expecting that.

4296
05:02:48,770 --> 05:02:49,990
NSD, J.L.C.

4297
05:02:49,990 --> 05:02:49,990

05:03:02,310 --> 05:03:02,690
Thank you.

4304
05:03:03,190 --> 05:03:06,010
Oh my, this might be the... No, no, I have Dynasty Warriors.

4305
05:03:06,230 --> 05:03:06,670
Never mind.

4306
05:03:10,130 --> 05:03:14,170
But like, I was not expecting this game to be that long.

4307
05:03:22,960 --> 05:03:25,100
Ain't going nowhere without this.

4308
05:03:27,380 --> 05:03:27,660
Sure.

4309
05:03:28,040 --> 05:03:30,780
Where would you muck spouts even be without?

4310
05:03:30,920 --> 05:03:34,000
And I've been like doing like super long streams for this
too.

4311
05:03:48,300 --> 05:03:49,880
It's been good fun so far.

4312
05:03:49,980 --> 05:03:51,540
I've been enjoying the series, yeah.

4313
05:03:52,560 --> 05:03:53,480
Patrice, thank you for chatting.

4314
05:03:54,040 --> 05:03:56,880
Thank you for being excited to see you beat this game in
May.

4315
05:03:57,160 --> 05:03:58,880
But I still needed help to break them.

4316
05:03:59,460 --> 05:04:01,160
This one is held strong.

4317
05:04:01,360 --> 05:04:03,200
There, I was drinking my water.

4318
05:04:04,980 --> 05:04:06,860
Yeah, I've been enjoying the story so far.

4319
05:04:07,040 --> 05:04:09,780
I don't recall asking you to come along.

4320
05:04:10,240 --> 05:04:11,100
Because you didn't.

4321
05:04:11,520 --> 05:04:14,320
I got an old drinking buddy I've been meaning to look up.

4322
05:04:14,400 --> 05:04:16,260
Once this joint we're back on the map.

4323
05:04:18,300 --> 05:04:20,940
Folks, a hand's gonna end me up where I'm going.

4324
05:04:21,420 --> 05:04:22,500
And what makes you think that?

4325
05:04:22,880 --> 05:04:27,640
Because last I heard tell, she was running with that beef
with brother of yours.

4326
05:04:27,960 --> 05:04:28,500
Freya.

4327
05:04:29,940 --> 05:04:33,040
I'm closer to the beginning than to the end.

4328
05:04:33,580 --> 05:04:34,960
That's fucked.

4329
05:04:37,640 --> 05:04:38,840
That's crazy.

4330
05:04:47,750 --> 05:04:50,410
Because I felt like I made so much progress, too.

4331
05:04:50,570 --> 05:04:51,950
This is part three.

4332
05:04:57,390 --> 05:04:57,790
Really?

4333
05:04:57,850 --> 05:05:14,870
is the door did i pass the door oh my god i didn't even
notice i passed the gate i was so confused this is not the

4334
05:05:14,870 --> 05:05:24,130
gate there's gonna be no gate showing up that way you know
that bro i don't know what the gate is i was so used to just

4335
05:05:24,130 --> 05:05:28,850
walking in a straight line until the gate appears oh my god

4336
05:05:35,320 --> 05:05:38,020
All right, here we go the pool of the binding curse.

4337
05:05:38,300 --> 05:05:39,680
I literally ran through the gate

4338
05:05:47,160 --> 05:05:54,800
That's crazy Fimble winters to blame but if it helps these
two find peace this is a temporary alliance Mimir anything

4339
05:05:54,800 --> 05:05:57,000
beyond that would require trust.

4340
05:05:57,180 --> 05:06:03,700
Oh, please you know damn well Kratos isn't the true cause of
your suffering You're both as much a part of my suffering as

4341
05:06:03,700 --> 05:06:07,880
anyone What's over here, though?

4342
05:06:08,040 --> 05:06:10,360
How's about a riddle delight in the mood?

4343
05:06:13,950 --> 05:06:15,170
Easy, a nose.

4344
05:06:15,530 --> 05:06:17,110
You'll have to try harder than that, Brock.

4345
05:06:18,170 --> 05:06:20,070
Just you wait, smart guy.

4346
05:06:21,810 --> 05:06:23,730
Oh my god, I'm gonna get so lost here.

4347
05:06:24,830 --> 05:06:25,850
Wait, there's trees.

4348
05:06:26,850 --> 05:06:29,930
That's gonna need more magic than we got, Sonny.

4349
05:06:31,990 --> 05:06:33,110
Oh, fuck.

4350
05:06:33,330 --> 05:06:35,830
There's too much stuff here.

4351
05:06:36,190 --> 05:06:36,650
No!

4352
05:06:41,050 --> 05:06:42,450
There's too much.

4353
05:06:44,050 --> 05:06:45,290
Why is this glowing?

4354
05:06:45,970 --> 05:06:51,030
Oh, the axe I left in my home came back to me.

4355
05:06:51,650 --> 05:06:51,890
Oh, no.

4356
05:06:52,850 --> 05:06:53,550
Something's wrong.

4357
05:06:54,370 --> 05:06:54,570
What?

4358
05:06:54,670 --> 05:06:55,230
My spell.

4359
05:06:55,430 --> 05:06:56,310
I can feel it slipping.

4360
05:06:56,810 --> 05:06:58,850
Well, that's fimbled winner for you.

4361
05:06:59,010 --> 05:06:59,770
You don't understand.

4362
05:06:59,870 --> 05:07:01,330
I'll be torn from the realm.

4363
05:07:01,590 --> 05:07:02,330
What can be done?

4364
05:07:02,810 --> 05:07:04,210
Something I was hoping to avoid.

4365
05:07:05,910 --> 05:07:07,270
Seems I don't have much choice.

4366
05:07:09,670 --> 05:07:10,250
Falky!

4367
05:07:11,130 --> 05:07:11,290
Oh.

4368
05:07:13,630 --> 05:07:14,890
She's a bird now.

4369
05:07:15,070 --> 05:07:17,550
You had a way around Odin's curse this whole time.

4370
05:07:17,850 --> 05:07:18,110
No.

4371
05:07:18,910 --> 05:07:21,370
I discovered it once you unlocked realm travel.

4372
05:07:21,790 --> 05:07:23,150
And it solves very little.

4373
05:07:23,290 --> 05:07:25,310
This form is extremely limiting.

4374
05:07:25,690 --> 05:07:27,250
Oh, she has to be a bird now?

4375
05:07:27,330 --> 05:07:28,890
Do not.

4376
05:07:30,210 --> 05:07:31,950
I do not do it, Doki.

4377
05:07:33,890 --> 05:07:35,630
She is like, stop.

4378
05:07:38,110 --> 05:07:42,390
Also, she can travel between realms if she's a bird.

4379
05:07:43,370 --> 05:07:44,810
God damn it.

4380
05:07:50,480 --> 05:07:51,780
Watch where you're going.

4381
05:07:52,200 --> 05:07:54,760
The plants are extra aggressive in this humidity.

4382
05:07:56,920 --> 05:07:58,220
What's your talking bird?

4383
05:07:59,060 --> 05:07:59,940
Oh shit!

4384
05:08:00,960 --> 05:08:02,620
She even warned me.

4385
05:08:03,360 --> 05:08:04,740
And I didn't listen.

4386
05:08:06,220 --> 05:08:08,140
Villages would meet and trade here.

4387
05:08:09,760 --> 05:08:15,260
they never rebuilt i'm gonna say how did i not hit

4388
05:08:18,300 --> 05:08:21,420
she's just like she just just like you

4389
05:08:30,870 --> 05:08:37,530
brother do you really think she'll let us off the hook if
you help her i always forget he's here he's part of the

4390
05:08:37,530 --> 05:08:40,970
entire thing after that we will see hi

4391
05:08:45,610 --> 05:08:46,130
Nice.

4392
05:08:46,490 --> 05:08:49,750
Looks like they sure left behind a lot of goodies.

4393
05:08:51,050 --> 05:08:52,590
All right, back here we go.

4394
05:08:52,970 --> 05:08:54,890
That's one way of looking at it.

4395
05:09:00,480 --> 05:09:01,960
I see it.

4396
05:09:02,540 --> 05:09:04,660
I'm more, I'm so paranoid now.

4397
05:09:08,460 --> 05:09:10,440
Oh wait, I dropped now.

4398
05:09:10,640 --> 05:09:10,760
Nice.

4399
05:09:12,360 --> 05:09:13,000
Oh, nice!

4400
05:09:15,860 --> 05:09:17,000
What the fuck?

4401
05:09:17,720 --> 05:09:19,140
Oh shit, I started to dominate.

4402
05:09:19,160 --> 05:09:36,900
effect I was gonna say why are they all just exploding there
I swear to God where is it okay I have to be sure oh my god

4403
05:09:36,900 --> 05:09:47,360
I fucking knew it how was I supposed to know there's a chest
here the exploding plan dokey that's how you're supposed

4404
05:09:49,160 --> 05:09:54,600
They must have withdrawn, hidden themselves out in the
wilds, and covered their tracks with magic.

4405
05:09:55,300 --> 05:09:58,640
No way of knowing how many are left or how to reach them.

4406
05:09:58,980 --> 05:10:02,400
Acer ran cockshot all over this place, huh?

4407
05:10:02,720 --> 05:10:04,520
You can thank Mimir for that.

4408
05:10:04,780 --> 05:10:06,800
War with the Vanir was never my idea.

4409
05:10:07,340 --> 05:10:10,300
My idea was brokering the marriage to end it.

4410
05:10:10,460 --> 05:10:12,320
A great success that was.

4411
05:10:12,780 --> 05:10:14,340
This is like our people, right?

4412
05:10:14,480 --> 05:10:16,020
That's a disaster than the marriage.

4413
05:10:16,740 --> 05:10:18,220
Did he invade again?

4414
05:10:20,540 --> 05:10:23,060
Yeah, marriage didn't do shit.

4415
05:10:24,560 --> 05:10:26,460
Awesome, like back to where people are.

4416
05:10:30,000 --> 05:10:35,980
So after exile, he's just like, okay, back to war.

4417
05:10:41,020 --> 05:10:43,220
Good old old olden.

4418
05:10:55,380 --> 05:10:58,020
God, fucking God, damn it!

4419
05:10:59,860 --> 05:11:11,820
I kind of hate these plants so much Fuck these plants Thank
god there's like heal stones here Oh my god And all Freya is

4420
05:11:11,820 --> 05:11:18,080
doing She's just watching She's just fucking watching

4421
05:11:22,360 --> 05:11:28,240
I'll beat up the wolves I don't know It's all right.

4422
05:11:28,340 --> 05:11:29,040
We got it.

4423
05:11:29,740 --> 05:11:30,420
What the fuck?

4424
05:11:30,940 --> 05:11:32,020
Where did you come from?

4425
05:11:35,200 --> 05:11:35,800
All right, Aaron.

4426
05:11:35,980 --> 05:11:37,120
Now we got all the wolves.

4427
05:11:39,280 --> 05:11:40,220
Oh my god.

4428
05:11:40,400 --> 05:11:41,280
There's more!

4429
05:11:45,380 --> 05:11:46,020
Oh, God.

4430
05:11:46,760 --> 05:11:47,300
It's all right.

4431
05:11:47,480 --> 05:11:47,860
It's all right.

4432
05:11:48,440 --> 05:11:48,960
It mixed up.

4433
05:11:49,120 --> 05:11:49,420
Oh, wait.

4434
05:11:49,460 --> 05:11:49,780
Never mind.

4435
05:11:50,000 --> 05:11:51,360
I thought I was like, holy kill, sir.

4436
05:11:52,980 --> 05:11:55,060
Okay, you can totally help out, Praia.

4437
05:11:55,160 --> 05:11:56,560
You can literally just come in here.

4438
05:11:56,860 --> 05:11:59,320
Maybe, like, Poked him a little with your little peep.

4439
05:12:00,500 --> 05:12:02,400
There is no way you're just watching.

4440
05:12:04,080 --> 05:12:05,800
Yeah, she likes to watch.

4441
05:12:06,040 --> 05:12:09,360
Oh, I remember your brother stirring up an awful scene.

4442
05:12:10,240 --> 05:12:12,220
Why do you keep bringing him up?

4443
05:12:12,780 --> 05:12:15,220
My brother is no concern of yours.

4444
05:12:15,780 --> 05:12:16,900
Do you understand?

4445
05:12:17,740 --> 05:12:19,520
Oh, I understand, planet.

4446
05:12:21,000 --> 05:12:22,560
Look, please be nice to him.

4447
05:12:22,620 --> 05:12:24,840
He only has three out of four souls.

4448
05:12:26,140 --> 05:12:27,460
He's our special dwarf.

4449
05:12:28,720 --> 05:12:29,680
He's blue.

4450
05:12:33,680 --> 05:12:36,600
She probably does like seeing Kratos get beat the shit out
of him.

4451
05:12:43,490 --> 05:12:44,730
That's why she's not helping.

4452
05:12:48,970 --> 05:12:50,510
Where was that?

4453
05:12:57,280 --> 05:12:59,340
Oh my god, I can't even run straight.

4454
05:13:12,970 --> 05:13:14,050
I swear to god.

4455
05:13:14,290 --> 05:13:15,950
I swear, what the fuck is that?

4456
05:13:17,870 --> 05:13:26,410
hey the plant life grows more dangerous the further we go
keep your up for it dwarf wait what i kept burning listen i

4457
05:13:26,410 --> 05:13:32,790
know how bad it oh there we go i just have to chop it when
he opens up and i were on the out so long it was like not

4458
05:13:32,790 --> 05:13:40,710
having a brother at all now i'd take some of the fall for
that on account of me walking out but it never stopped me

4459
05:13:40,710 --> 05:13:43,790
blaming him most any of this

4460
05:13:47,030 --> 05:13:57,470
My point is that weren't the end to all of things after all
Once we got our heads right, it was like no time He went

4461
05:13:57,470 --> 05:14:02,690
straight back to being as big a pain in my ass as he ever
was That's family.

4462
05:14:03,030 --> 05:14:07,070
You got to keep them close where they make you good and
crazy.

4463
05:14:07,410 --> 05:14:10,230
Why do you think I need to hear any of this right now?

4464
05:14:10,730 --> 05:14:20,550
My focus is on regaining my freedom and I have no intention
of being distracted Look, all I'm saying is, if you happen

4465
05:14:20,550 --> 05:14:28,590
to find yourself talking to your brother, maybe the worst
one said between you don't have to be the last one said.

4466
05:14:29,150 --> 05:14:29,150
Enough.

4467
05:14:30,030 --> 05:14:35,190
When the day comes to face prayer again, it will be when I
am standing on my feet and free.

4468
05:14:35,350 --> 05:14:36,350
Do you understand me?

4469
05:14:36,910 --> 05:14:40,550
It will not be while I'm stuck in this preposterous
situation.

4470
05:14:41,550 --> 05:14:43,750
I've got a case of pride, I get it.

4471
05:14:44,230 --> 05:14:46,650
Hope yours clears up quicker than mine did.

4472
05:14:47,030 --> 05:14:49,180
A touching story that was.

4473
05:14:51,290 --> 05:14:54,070
They're like, they're like fucking arguing.

4474
05:14:54,950 --> 05:14:55,910
Like, what's up?

4475
05:14:58,450 --> 05:15:04,770
Where the fuck is the last one?

4476
05:15:12,830 --> 05:15:18,490
Was Brock just being like, being like, just for, like, just
don't...

4477
05:15:18,590 --> 05:15:24,570
um just don't don't let your pain and grief consume you type
deal

4478
05:15:28,490 --> 05:15:33,890

4479
05:15:39,710 --> 05:15:42,390

4481
05:16:05,820 --> 05:16:07,320

4482
05:16:15,440 --> 05:16:17,540
oh there it is are you serious?

4483
05:16:17,700 --> 05:16:30,180
It was like it's like so far back how do I get that I don't

4484
05:16:30,180 --> 05:16:38,180
fuse okay last one is as an R there you go

4485
05:16:44,570 --> 05:16:47,130
okay Man, that was a sneaky one.

4486
05:16:50,450 --> 05:16:53,710
That was a very sneaky one that they did.

4487
05:16:54,110 --> 05:16:57,130
What did Odin do to drive everyone away?

4488
05:16:57,810 --> 05:16:59,170
They literally invaded.

4489
05:17:00,690 --> 05:17:02,270
How much was just Mjolnir?

4490
05:17:03,110 --> 05:17:05,710
Can one man do this much damage?

4491
05:17:06,370 --> 05:17:09,070
Depends on the weapon and the man.

4492
05:17:09,950 --> 05:17:10,790
Mjolnir's door.

4493
05:17:12,910 --> 05:17:14,710
Do you not see what the fuck he did?

4494
05:17:14,710 --> 05:17:25,130

never seen it so empty

Oh my god, bro.

4636
05:29:06,150 --> 05:29:07,810
The forbidden love.

4637
05:29:08,570 --> 05:29:09,790
That is cute.

4638
05:29:11,210 --> 05:29:13,410
We got exiled for that.

4639
05:29:13,970 --> 05:29:14,790
Oh my god.

4640
05:29:15,350 --> 05:29:16,230
They're like, no!

4641
05:29:17,030 --> 05:29:18,670
You cannot be together.

4642
05:29:18,890 --> 05:29:19,610
It ain't right.

4643
05:29:19,810 --> 05:29:21,670
And they're like, love has no boundaries.

4644
05:29:23,070 --> 05:29:24,810
Why did I ask him for advice?

4645
05:29:29,440 --> 05:29:30,660
Why did I ask him for advice?

4646
05:29:30,760 --> 05:29:33,520
How the fuck did he was able to score a baddie like her?

4647
05:29:34,260 --> 05:29:36,160
I have words if you would hear them.

4648
05:29:36,880 --> 05:29:37,300
Speak then.

4649
05:29:37,660 --> 05:29:39,500
With anger you feel for your brother.

4650
05:29:40,240 --> 05:29:41,120
I know it well.

4651
05:29:41,480 --> 05:29:42,140
You have a brother?

4652
05:29:42,780 --> 05:29:43,840
His name was Demos.

4653
05:29:45,000 --> 05:29:49,380
When we were boys, he was taken by two gods obsessed with
prophecy.

4654
05:29:50,280 --> 05:29:52,820
The gods of my homeland seldom left survivors.

4655
05:29:53,120 --> 05:30:02,760
so by the time i learned he had lived it was too late for
amends his anger poisoned him against me but i never stopped

4656
05:30:02,760 --> 05:30:10,040
loving my brother you think my anger is irrational can he
kill his brother your moments and already you're taking his

4657
05:30:10,040 --> 05:30:20,880
side i am not taking it no you're just sharing your thoughts
on a subject you know nothing about did i kill my brother

4658
05:30:23,120 --> 05:30:24,760
Oh, someone else killed them.

4659
05:30:24,920 --> 05:30:26,700
Okay, at least it wasn't me.

4660
05:30:28,280 --> 05:30:29,140
I fucking...

4661
05:30:29,140 --> 05:30:30,440
I fucking knew it.

4662
05:30:35,140 --> 05:30:36,820
It wasn't me, though.

4663
05:30:39,460 --> 05:30:41,400
I never know if I'm...

4664
05:30:41,400 --> 05:30:42,820
Okay, I am going the right way.

4665
05:30:42,920 --> 05:30:44,500
Okay, that means there was some...

4666
05:30:44,500 --> 05:30:46,040
There was, like...

4667
05:30:46,040 --> 05:30:47,800
Are you fucking kidding me?

4668
05:30:47,860 --> 05:30:51,680
Okay, I knew there was a chest here.

4669
05:31:00,610 --> 05:31:01,810
Is there any other way here?

4670
05:31:02,250 --> 05:31:03,470
Or is this just a secret?

4671
05:31:08,920 --> 05:31:11,500
Is there like an extra path over here I didn't see?

4672
05:31:11,740 --> 05:31:12,740
I want to be sure.

4673
05:31:16,380 --> 05:31:16,620
Wait, no.

4674
05:31:16,820 --> 05:31:17,740
This was the correct way.

4675
05:31:18,300 --> 05:31:18,980
God damn it.

4676
05:31:19,000 --> 05:31:20,300
I'm always so confused.

4677
05:31:21,340 --> 05:31:21,720
Oh wait, no.

4678
05:31:22,020 --> 05:31:22,020
Yeah.

4679
05:31:27,260 --> 05:31:27,880
Yeah, loot.

4680
05:31:31,440 --> 05:31:32,620
Okay, okay, thank God.

4681
05:31:32,780 --> 05:31:33,120
I knew it.

4682
05:31:33,160 --> 05:31:33,840
I knew it.

4683
05:31:34,240 --> 05:31:38,040
I knew this was the, uh, this was the loot way.

4684
05:31:39,100 --> 05:31:40,680
My loot senses were tingling.

4685
05:31:44,800 --> 05:31:45,660
Oh, we go this way.

4686
05:31:47,380 --> 05:31:48,320
Yeah, this map is huge.

4687
05:31:48,440 --> 05:31:49,260
It's pretty though.

4688
05:31:49,940 --> 05:31:51,460
I swear to God, I swear to God.

4689
05:31:51,460 --> 05:31:55,020
Okay, okay, I was gonna say, I swear to God, if he starts
fucking exploding right there.

4690
05:32:06,320 --> 05:32:12,680
I think the worst part is that everything looks the same on
this An ancient.

4691
05:32:17,760 --> 05:32:17,920
Oh.

4692
05:32:20,260 --> 05:32:22,700

Not friendly.

4726
05:34:48,110 --> 05:34:48,690
Not friendly.

I don't know if I like the axe beam.

4731
05:35:34,570 --> 05:35:35,410
Is the axe beam that good?

4732
05:35:39,230 --> 05:35:40,170
I don't know.

4733
05:35:40,310 --> 05:35:41,930
I don't know how I feel about the axe beam.

4734
05:35:43,090 --> 05:35:44,550
Does it actually do a lot of damage?

4735
05:35:52,110 --> 05:35:53,990
Yeah, it doesn't seem very good.

4736
05:35:56,750 --> 05:35:58,330
Fuck this tree in particular.

4737
05:36:00,990 --> 05:36:02,690
Yeah, it feels kind of meh.

4738
05:36:02,850 --> 05:36:03,750
I'm not really...

4739
05:36:03,750 --> 05:36:04,510
I'm not really...

4740
05:36:05,110 --> 05:36:13,510
Enjoying it says like a lot of damage, but it did not feel
like a lot of damage Oh, I guess I have to use it for now

4741
05:36:15,470 --> 05:36:17,570
Yeah, I can't really do much about it

Nope.

4774
05:40:32,300 --> 05:40:34,020
No more alpha in the forest.

4775
05:40:35,960 --> 05:40:37,180
My forest now.

4776
05:40:37,900 --> 05:40:38,100
That's right.

4777
05:40:38,220 --> 05:40:39,900
My territory now.

4778
05:40:50,010 --> 05:40:50,930
But yeah, no, that.

4779
05:40:51,050 --> 05:40:51,590

That beam was shit.

4781
05:40:54,530 --> 05:40:58,130
I'm going to swap it back to my regular, the one I used
before.

4782
05:40:58,710 --> 05:41:00,170
I know your son's story.

4783
05:41:01,250 --> 05:41:02,450
You should know my daughter.

4784
05:41:03,250 --> 05:41:03,890
That's right.

4785
05:41:03,930 --> 05:41:04,750
I'm trauma-jumping.

4786
05:41:05,630 --> 05:41:08,130
I was tricked into destroying a village.

4787
05:41:08,890 --> 05:41:13,190
Not knowing my own wife and child were there until their
blood stained my hands.

4788
05:41:14,330 --> 05:41:15,490
I swore revenge.

4789
05:41:17,430 --> 05:41:17,990
That's...

4790
05:41:17,990 --> 05:41:18,990
I can't imagine.

4791
05:41:18,990 --> 05:41:20,390
Yeah, see, that's worse, right?

4792
05:41:20,690 --> 05:41:22,930
My trauma's worse than your trauma.

4793
05:41:23,190 --> 05:41:23,590
To the ground.

4794
05:41:28,930 --> 05:41:30,350
Perhaps you will kill me, Preya.

4795
05:41:31,490 --> 05:41:33,410
But it will bring you no peace.

4796
05:41:34,230 --> 05:41:35,450
Perhaps it is not peace.

4797
05:41:35,470 --> 05:41:46,010
i seek all those times i found you why'd you refuse to fight
me every outcome would mean defeat what does that mean i

Okay, beam!

05:42:39,370 --> 05:42:40,830
Stupid ass beam.

4805
05:42:46,550 --> 05:42:49,330
Yeah, it jumps me hard.

4806
05:42:55,040 --> 05:42:56,180
Iron ice beast scraps.

4807
05:42:56,600 --> 05:42:57,780
Those are good upgrade shit.

4808
05:42:59,660 --> 05:43:00,760
That's over here.

4809
05:43:01,440 --> 05:43:02,480
Oh, nothing.

4810
05:43:03,820 --> 05:43:04,560
What the fuck?

4811
05:43:04,740 --> 05:43:05,880
They put this little thing here.

4812
05:43:05,960 --> 05:43:06,560
It's nothing?

4813
05:43:08,300 --> 05:43:09,320
My village.

4814
05:43:10,120 --> 05:43:10,200
Oh.

4815
05:43:11,600 --> 05:43:15,140
Yeah, I don't think there's anyone here.

4816
05:43:15,480 --> 05:43:18,120
I used to play hide and seek the fair in the crops.

4817
05:43:19,500 --> 05:43:22,660
We spend afternoon stealing honey bread from the Grand Hall.

4818
05:43:23,440 --> 05:43:26,620
At harvest time, we dance and feast until the sun leaves.

4819
05:43:26,900 --> 05:43:27,140
Oh.

4820
05:43:27,520 --> 05:43:28,800
It was all so simple.

4821
05:43:29,340 --> 05:43:30,800
Why did I have to come back to you?

4822
05:43:31,760 --> 05:43:33,400
Be reminded of all this.

4823
05:43:35,680 --> 05:43:36,240
Oh.

4824
05:43:36,540 --> 05:43:36,960
Oh.

4825
05:43:41,020 --> 05:43:41,980
Poor Freya.

4826
05:43:43,720 --> 05:43:45,020
It's in ruin.

4827
05:43:45,980 --> 05:43:47,320
We're trauma bonding.

4828
05:43:53,200 --> 05:43:53,880
Weed.

4829
05:43:54,980 --> 05:43:56,540
May Freya never waver.

4830
05:43:57,200 --> 05:43:58,300
The other half is missing.

4831
05:43:59,200 --> 05:44:01,160
May she protect us always.

4832
05:44:02,620 --> 05:44:03,940
An old adage, if you will.

4833
05:44:05,020 --> 05:44:07,320
You can get through over here!

4834
05:44:09,060 --> 05:44:09,520
Oh, yeah.

4835
05:44:09,820 --> 05:44:11,360
Okay, but what if there's loot over here?

4836
05:44:12,720 --> 05:44:13,800
I'll make sure.

4837
05:44:14,880 --> 05:44:15,400
I knew it.

4838
05:44:16,220 --> 05:44:17,420
I knew it for you.

4839
05:44:17,840 --> 05:44:20,040
You try to get me away from my loot?

4840
05:44:21,060 --> 05:44:22,220
My precious loot.

4841
05:44:24,360 --> 05:44:26,740
Okay, I should be able to get here somewhere.

4842
05:44:31,460 --> 05:44:33,220
I smell the chest.

4843
05:44:36,680 --> 05:44:37,060
Wait, where?

4844
05:44:38,900 --> 05:44:41,300
Where's the place that I can get through?

4845
05:44:41,880 --> 05:44:42,420
Oh, it's here.

4846
05:44:42,520 --> 05:44:42,720
Okay.

4847
05:44:46,870 --> 05:44:48,910
Yeah, you try to...

4848
05:44:48,910 --> 05:44:49,510
What?

4849
05:44:50,130 --> 05:44:50,610
What?

4850
05:45:04,270 --> 05:45:06,590
There we go, there we go, there we go, that worked, that
worked.

4851
05:45:08,050 --> 05:45:09,430
I got it, I got it, though.

4852
05:45:10,290 --> 05:45:11,050
I got it, though.

4853
05:45:14,730 --> 05:45:16,270
It's okay, I got it in the end.

4854
05:45:19,010 --> 05:45:20,630
Why is there, like, a magic thing?

4855
05:45:20,710 --> 05:45:21,070
Oh, here.

4856
05:45:22,610 --> 05:45:24,190
Okay, I don't...

4857
05:45:24,190 --> 05:45:25,090
Missed it.

4858
05:45:32,050 --> 05:45:33,170
A hitter?

4859
05:45:33,890 --> 05:45:34,850
I can't tell.

4860
05:45:35,090 --> 05:45:35,890
No, I did not.

4861
05:45:37,610 --> 05:45:38,550
Okay, yeah, wait, wait.

4862
05:45:43,250 --> 05:45:45,830
Okay, I missed my entire beam.

4863
05:45:47,050 --> 05:45:48,650
That is a little embarrassing.

4864
05:45:51,710 --> 05:45:53,450
All right, we have to get to the archer, man.

4865
05:45:54,810 --> 05:45:56,550
Just to be sure that she doesn't summon more.

4866
05:45:58,190 --> 05:45:58,290
Whoa!

4867
05:46:01,630 --> 05:46:02,370
Yeah, no more!

4868
05:46:06,230 --> 05:46:06,690
Okay.

4869
05:46:07,230 --> 05:46:07,610
Get out of here.

4870
05:46:07,690 --> 05:46:08,330
That's right.

4871
05:46:08,810 --> 05:46:10,890
I used this pair against you.

4872
05:46:13,210 --> 05:46:13,650
There you go.

4873
05:46:15,690 --> 05:46:16,610
He comboed!

4874
05:46:23,870 --> 05:46:43,790
I'm gonna bash her up combo time this there's more oh my god

05:46:43,790 --> 05:46:52,790

4876
05:46:54,230 --> 05:46:55,830
Wait, which one is she?

4877
05:47:00,850 --> 05:47:02,530
Oh wow, I'm so confused.

4878
05:47:03,990 --> 05:47:06,770
I don't know which one is a goddamn stupid archer.

4879
05:47:13,090 --> 05:47:14,170
I'm so sad.

4880
05:47:14,250 --> 05:47:15,250
I don't know where she is.

4881
05:47:15,630 --> 05:47:18,430
I actually don't know where the Fuck the archer is.

4882
05:47:21,310 --> 05:47:23,010
I'm just gonna fucking...

4883
05:47:23,010 --> 05:47:24,190
I'm just gonna kill it.

4884
05:47:24,950 --> 05:47:25,870
Are you serious?

4885
05:47:26,050 --> 05:47:26,210
That's it.

4886
05:47:26,250 --> 05:47:26,710
I'm raging.

4887
05:47:28,850 --> 05:47:30,650
I'm just gonna get rid of this guy first.

4888
05:47:32,070 --> 05:47:34,790
And then I'm gonna stop being angry and I'm gonna find her.

4889
05:47:37,410 --> 05:47:38,190
There she is.

4890
05:47:38,430 --> 05:47:39,370
This has to be her.

4891
05:47:42,230 --> 05:47:42,950
That's right.

4892
05:47:44,650 --> 05:47:46,810
You ain't standing no more reinforcing.

4893
05:47:47,730 --> 05:47:57,530
can't do archery now when you have no arms he's desecrated
every memory I have of home be glad you have a home to

4894
05:47:57,530 --> 05:48:05,190
remember fondly oh yeah I destroyed my home we were taken
from our homes as children and raised in the a goji we

4895
05:48:05,190 --> 05:48:12,890
marched or we drowned fought for scraps or starved our
elders beat us till we cannot stand this is not a

4896
05:48:12,890 --> 05:48:18,210
competition alone Let her fucking vent!

4897
05:48:18,690 --> 05:48:21,150
That is how Spartans are made.

4898
05:48:23,190 --> 05:48:23,810
What?

4899
05:48:25,870 --> 05:48:27,870
Bro, let her vent!

4900
05:48:28,150 --> 05:48:30,790
Bro, that's a fuck.

4901
05:48:33,770 --> 05:48:35,890
He's like, oh, you think you had it bad?

4902
05:48:37,810 --> 05:48:39,330
Okay, nah, I didn't stop.

4903
05:48:41,910 --> 05:48:44,250
It's not, but he is winning.

4904
05:48:45,150 --> 05:48:49,250
cannot be, he can't lose any fight of me.

4905
05:48:54,350 --> 05:48:56,570
He's like, stop complaining, bitch.

4906
05:49:03,910 --> 05:49:06,410
It's a trauma-dumping competition.

4907
05:49:07,490 --> 05:49:09,170
And I don't think anyone's winning.

4908
05:49:09,730 --> 05:49:11,570
Oh, no, Kratos is definitely winning, JK.

4909
05:49:12,370 --> 05:49:14,110
No, he is definitely winning this.

4910
05:49:17,750 --> 05:49:18,490
Anything here?

4911
05:49:18,630 --> 05:49:21,170
Okay, she wants me to go this way.

4912
05:49:22,070 --> 05:49:23,450
I shall go this way.

4913
05:49:26,270 --> 05:49:29,210
Even in trauma, he is the strongest.

4914
05:49:29,870 --> 05:49:31,010
He really is.

4915
05:49:33,390 --> 05:49:42,860
All right, let's go this way.

4916
05:49:42,940 --> 05:49:44,040
Oh, why blue?

4917
05:49:45,140 --> 05:49:50,120
These plants behave similarly to the scorn poles we found in
the foothills of Midgard ages ago.

4918
05:49:53,020 --> 05:49:57,540
Oh, that's why it blew.

4919
05:49:59,320 --> 05:50:00,260
Wait, we're a bird.

4920
05:50:01,580 --> 05:50:02,300
Oh, bird here.

4921
05:50:11,340 --> 05:50:15,620
Well, considering how Spartans are made, it's no wonder you
turned out as you did.

4922
05:50:16,600 --> 05:50:18,380
Your fate was sealed from the start.

4923
05:50:18,860 --> 05:50:19,800
Fate can be overcome.

4924
05:50:20,380 --> 05:50:21,560
I used to think so.

4925
05:50:22,520 --> 05:50:26,660
When the Norns told me of my son's fate, I thought I could
change it.

4926
05:50:27,700 --> 05:50:32,820
You know well how that worked out the lords the fates of
these lands.

4927
05:50:33,020 --> 05:50:36,540
That's right You defy prophecy at your own peril

4928
05:50:40,420 --> 05:50:43,500
No, no no

4929
05:50:47,170 --> 05:50:54,870
I saw loot Where where did it send me?

4930
05:50:55,370 --> 05:51:04,070
Okay, here It faded me with loot Finally, to the scorn poles
we found in the foothills of Midgard ages ago.

4931
05:51:05,890 --> 05:51:10,630
Well, considering how Spartans are made, it's no wonder you
turned out as you did.

4932
05:51:10,970 --> 05:51:11,430
Agreed.

4933
05:51:11,770 --> 05:51:13,410
I got to agree.

4934
05:51:15,810 --> 05:51:17,470
Brows, thank you for the super chat.

4935
05:51:17,630 --> 05:51:17,890
Thank you.

4936
05:51:17,910 --> 05:51:18,530
Thank you.

4937
05:51:19,270 --> 05:51:22,750
Okay, this is the one that goes to your friend and say, Be
happy you have a family.

4938
05:51:23,030 --> 05:51:23,170
What?

4939
05:51:23,170 --> 05:51:24,710
You know how that worked out.

4940
05:51:25,270 --> 05:51:25,850
The Norns.

4941
05:51:26,450 --> 05:51:27,710
The fates of these lands.

4942
05:51:27,950 --> 05:51:28,350
That's right.

4943
05:51:28,610 --> 05:51:29,430
He faded me.

4944
05:51:30,410 --> 05:51:34,890
at your own i saw chess and i was like i'm gonna bunga me
likey

4945
05:51:43,340 --> 05:51:52,840
all right up we go the trace would agree with you about
prophecy he rushes blindly to a fate the giants foretold

4946
05:51:52,840 --> 05:52:03,440
this is my day with a super chat thank you thank you i know
all the ragnarok prophecies there's no champion of the

4947
05:52:03,440 --> 05:52:14,820
giants it is one because of this champion the realms are
saved at Ragnarok only as God falls and Odin with it so all

4948
05:52:14,820 --> 05:52:25,400
this time Odin's obsession with every detail of Ragnarok
he's been missing a crucial piece well done well the trace

4949
05:52:25,400 --> 05:52:35,380
will not be a pawn of prophecy you still stand against fate
you will be his own person I will not march my son to war he

4950
05:52:35,380 --> 05:52:48,220
is no spartan i would keep it that way damn he will choose
his own destiny even if it's a destiny i do not approve of

4951
05:52:48,220 --> 05:52:56,400
protecting your child is my tragedy not enough of a lesson
fighting fate is a waste of the precious time we're given to

4952
05:52:56,400 --> 05:53:15,180
spend with them okay you want me to go this way so i go this
way if he wishes to be a wolf i shall accept him if he

4953
05:53:15,180 --> 05:53:25,180
wishes we will not let prophecy dictate his fate his
prophecy didn't think he would want to be a wolf and that is

4954
05:53:25,180 --> 05:53:26,860
enough for me

4955
05:53:32,770 --> 05:53:35,430
how did I do

4956
05:53:41,310 --> 05:54:02,150

islands to get a better angle on the torch no

05:54:49,800 --> 05:54:52,000
Yeah, that's not pushing it.

4962
05:54:57,260 --> 05:54:58,540
Alright, now do that.

4963
05:54:59,020 --> 05:55:01,440
And they'll swing, right?

4964
05:55:02,720 --> 05:55:03,500
I fucking...

4965
05:55:03,500 --> 05:55:04,560
I don't fucking know.

4966
05:55:07,080 --> 05:55:07,800
Bro, I...

4967
05:55:07,800 --> 05:55:08,500
Oh, my God.

4968
05:55:10,460 --> 05:55:11,680
Why can't I...

4969
05:55:15,170 --> 05:55:15,970
Okay, wait.

4970
05:55:17,970 --> 05:55:19,790
Wait, can I actually drop down?

4971
05:55:19,910 --> 05:55:21,230
It won't let me drop down.

4972
05:55:24,150 --> 05:55:41,580
oh my god it's here okay i was so confused but it was right

and then oh okay come on bro

4975
05:55:56,360 --> 05:55:57,420
There we go.

4976
05:55:57,620 --> 05:55:58,640
Okay, I couldn't push up.

4977
05:55:58,840 --> 05:56:01,600
I have to push... I'll push down to me.

4978
05:56:04,700 --> 05:56:06,700
Let's cross the bridge now.

4979
05:56:12,580 --> 05:56:13,980
Okay, give me a sec, Freya.

4980
05:56:15,880 --> 05:56:17,700
Where's the last one, though?

4981
05:56:23,520 --> 05:56:25,180
I like this one.

4982
05:56:25,480 --> 05:56:27,200
But where's the...

4983
05:56:27,840 --> 05:56:30,340
I'm going to have to bring this over again.

4984
05:56:31,200 --> 05:56:34,640
Oh, it's down there.

4985
05:56:35,940 --> 05:56:36,340
All right.

4986
05:56:37,320 --> 05:56:41,480
How can you, of anyone alive, be squeamish about war?

4987
05:56:42,840 --> 05:56:44,280
After all the gods you've killed.

4988
05:56:44,920 --> 05:56:46,940
I have seen enough war to know the cost.

4989
05:56:47,320 --> 05:56:48,360
I'm retired.

4990
05:56:48,780 --> 05:56:50,640
I'm no longer the god of war.

4991
05:56:51,860 --> 05:56:52,940
I'm a god of dads.

4992
05:56:56,260 --> 05:56:56,960
Yeah, more health.

4993
05:57:03,040 --> 05:57:04,240
I'm retired.

4994
05:57:06,380 --> 05:57:08,900
You know, like war no more.

4995
05:57:10,400 --> 05:57:12,620
I'm the god of dads, yeah.

4996
05:57:29,410 --> 05:57:31,190
Yeah, too much trauma.

4997
05:57:31,790 --> 05:57:33,390
That's one of Odin's captains.

4998
05:57:34,230 --> 05:57:34,750
Be ready.

4999
05:57:35,610 --> 05:57:38,430
Oh, this guy?

5000
05:57:44,510 --> 05:57:45,190
Okay.

5001
05:57:48,270 --> 05:57:49,870
Oh my god, what are you...

5002
05:57:51,150 --> 05:57:52,230
I got it wrong first.

5003
05:57:52,370 --> 05:57:52,850
I got it first.

5004
05:57:52,990 --> 05:57:53,570
I got it first

5005
05:57:58,090 --> 05:58:06,690
Okay, that's fine Nice, oh shit nice No, I didn't get the
third second one.

5006
05:58:07,170 --> 05:58:08,530
Oh, I didn't get it, but I can do this now

5007
05:58:12,570 --> 05:58:13,890
Okay, that's bullshit

5008
05:58:17,750 --> 05:58:18,970
Are you fucking cute?

5009
05:58:19,030 --> 05:58:20,710
Okay, I got the Parry for it, though.

5010
05:58:22,650 --> 05:58:23,310
Get parry!

5011
05:58:25,870 --> 05:58:27,770
Oh my god, I didn't miss that.

5012
05:58:28,790 --> 05:58:30,050
Are you serious?

5013
05:58:30,170 --> 05:58:31,250
Okay, that's bullshit!

5014
05:58:34,890 --> 05:58:36,170
I got blocked!

5015
05:58:37,010 --> 05:58:37,610
Okay, this time.

5016
05:58:43,010 --> 05:58:43,870
Okay, nice.

5017
05:58:44,250 --> 05:58:44,930
It's red.

5018
05:58:45,510 --> 05:58:46,410
You know what that means?

5019
05:58:47,030 --> 05:58:47,830
Rage time!

5020
05:58:48,410 --> 05:58:48,930
Oh, wait.

5021
05:58:49,170 --> 05:58:49,450
All right.

5022
05:58:49,970 --> 05:58:50,850
but then you're rage.

5023
05:58:52,690 --> 05:58:52,690
Jesus.

5024
05:58:53,310 --> 05:58:54,730
He was his captain?

5025
05:58:55,930 --> 05:58:58,410
That scout was easy as hell.

5026
05:59:00,890 --> 05:59:01,370
Bro.

5027
05:59:02,630 --> 05:59:04,850
Don't quit your day job.

5028
05:59:08,130 --> 05:59:10,030
Bro, that guy...

5029
05:59:10,030 --> 05:59:12,150
I think Odin needs to find new recruitment.

5030
05:59:13,310 --> 05:59:16,750
It was not that difficult for a captain of his army.

5031
05:59:17,310 --> 05:59:17,730
I mean...

5032
05:59:21,190 --> 05:59:21,670
Back

5033
05:59:24,770 --> 05:59:27,490
what you have lost any more than killing me.

5034
05:59:27,710 --> 05:59:28,930
I am reaching my limit.

5035
05:59:29,270 --> 05:59:31,650
Okay, she wants me to go that way, so I go the opposite
direction.

5036
05:59:31,910 --> 05:59:33,730
Can you please just shut up and kill things?

5037
05:59:35,370 --> 05:59:37,210
Whoa, whoa, chill, chill.

5038
05:59:37,610 --> 05:59:37,790
Why not?

5039
05:59:37,910 --> 05:59:39,150
I'll do it eventually.

5040
05:59:40,050 --> 05:59:42,490
You know, I literally just killed the captain.

5041
05:59:44,610 --> 05:59:45,910
It'll happen, girl.

5042
05:59:46,210 --> 05:59:46,650
It'll happen.

5043
05:59:48,870 --> 05:59:50,550
Yeah, is this your king?

5044
05:59:53,310 --> 05:59:54,690
Please, Preya.

5045
05:59:55,070 --> 05:59:57,290
Please, let me have some loot.

5046
05:59:57,930 --> 06:00:01,490
I literally just killed the captain of the Odin's army.

5047
06:00:05,250 --> 06:00:09,010
When it wants to be an arrow prank treatment, I think it's a
super chatty.

5048
06:00:09,450 --> 06:00:10,990
Then I must accept it.

5049
06:00:13,330 --> 06:00:15,390
It'll just be a phase.

5050
06:00:26,040 --> 06:00:26,620
Oh, no.

5051
06:00:27,640 --> 06:00:29,340
Okay, okay, I can do this puzzle.

5052
06:00:30,160 --> 06:00:31,840
Oh, okay.

5053
06:00:32,580 --> 06:00:33,960
Oh, I'm just back where I started, right?

5054
06:00:34,940 --> 06:00:36,220
No, this is a puzzle.

5055
06:00:39,920 --> 06:00:43,140
Okay, so I can't do anything here.

5056
06:00:43,620 --> 06:00:45,300
Oh, oh, you used that.

5057
06:00:45,300 --> 06:00:46,460
Ha, you almost got me.

5058
06:00:46,880 --> 06:00:48,540
Oh, you thought you got me there, huh?

5059
06:00:48,760 --> 06:00:49,220
Ha, ha.

5060
06:00:49,500 --> 06:00:51,620
I fucking saw it right through you.

5061
06:00:55,280 --> 06:00:56,300
That's fucking red.

5062
06:00:56,680 --> 06:00:57,520
I saw it.

5063
06:00:57,740 --> 06:00:59,280
I saw what you wanted to do.

5064
06:01:01,920 --> 06:01:02,500
That's right.

5065
06:01:02,580 --> 06:01:03,820
He almost got me there.

5066
06:01:04,420 --> 06:01:04,420
Almost.

5067
06:01:05,300 --> 06:01:05,300
Almost.

5068
06:01:06,460 --> 06:01:09,640
Oh, he should have grown.

5069
06:01:13,700 --> 06:01:14,720
Yes, more loot.

5070
06:01:15,020 --> 06:01:15,840
More loot, please.

5071
06:01:17,320 --> 06:01:17,760
More loot.

5072
06:01:22,200 --> 06:01:23,080
Okay, cool.

5073
06:01:24,880 --> 06:01:25,640
Hey, more loot.

5074
06:01:26,560 --> 06:01:27,180
Look, loot, loot.

06:01:29,700 --> 06:01:31,380
What is there here?

5076
06:01:32,400 --> 06:01:34,000
Oh, that's where I have to go.

5077
06:01:34,180 --> 06:01:35,420
Okay, but what is this then?

5078
06:01:38,380 --> 06:01:40,060
What is this for?

5079
06:01:41,580 --> 06:01:42,560
What the fuck?

5080
06:01:42,700 --> 06:01:44,060
Wait, did I just hear dog barking?

5081
06:01:47,340 --> 06:01:48,840

5182
06:09:26,690 --> 06:09:27,190
Okay, it's fine.

5183
06:09:27,890 --> 06:09:29,110
Oh, it's not fine.

5184
06:09:29,670 --> 06:09:30,670
Oh my god, bro.

5185
06:09:30,990 --> 06:09:31,290

5186
06:09:34,350 --> 06:09:38,510

5191
06:09:42,710 --> 06:09:42,970
Okay.

5192
06:09:45,930 --> 06:09:46,910
Oh, I did it.

5193
06:09:48,730 --> 06:09:49,850
I did the thing.

5194
06:09:50,250 --> 06:09:50,470
That's right.

5195
06:09:50,470 --> 06:09:51,690
Get off of that shit.

5196
06:09:52,290 --> 06:09:53,550
Using high ground.

5197
06:09:54,450 --> 06:09:54,890
Stupid.

5198
06:09:55,530 --> 06:09:56,710
No high ground for you.

5199
06:09:56,810 --> 06:09:57,610
Only I can have high ground.

5200
06:09:57,630 --> 06:09:59,290
But I can be angry.

5201
06:10:00,010 --> 06:10:02,530
I gotta grab this first before I get angry.

5202
06:10:03,230 --> 06:10:03,790
Angry time!

5203
06:10:04,590 --> 06:10:05,190

5212
06:10:29,110 --> 06:10:31,930
Okay, I have to be able to actually have to parry this shit.

5223
06:11:16,210 --> 06:11:16,890

06:11:19,830 --> 06:11:20,890
Okay, it's fine.

5225
06:11:22,350 --> 06:11:23,470
It is more desperate!

06:11:23,910 --> 06:11:25,490
Yes, be ready for anything!

5227
06:11:27,630 --> 06:11:29,530
One fucking head was blocking it.

5228
06:11:30,230 --> 06:11:31,190
It's not fair.

5229
06:11:32,270 --> 06:11:32,270
Boom.

5230
06:11:33,370 --> 06:11:33,370

06:11:36,470 --> 06:11:38,890

5232
06:11:41,810 --> 06:11:43,910
There you go.

5233
06:11:46,570 --> 06:11:46,690

06:13:06,680 --> 06:13:07,420

06:16:22,400 --> 06:16:23,480
Yeah, she got banned.

5291
06:16:23,540 --> 06:16:24,360
This is the point.

5292
06:16:24,660 --> 06:16:26,160
She submitted it on banned request.

5293
06:16:28,700 --> 06:16:29,000
Yes?

5294
06:16:29,560 --> 06:16:30,160
No.

5295
06:16:35,170 --> 06:16:36,450
How have you decided?

5296
06:16:40,030 --> 06:16:41,710
Magical scissors.

5297
06:16:54,480 --> 06:16:54,900
Huh?

5298
06:16:55,300 --> 06:16:56,060
To be honest.

5299
06:17:00,500 --> 06:17:01,780
I don't think I can do either.

5300
06:17:03,480 --> 06:17:03,920
Oh.

5301
06:17:07,780 --> 06:17:09,680
There's still a part of me.

5302
06:17:11,540 --> 06:17:12,740
That is so...

5303
06:17:14,260 --> 06:17:15,080
angry.

5304
06:17:15,980 --> 06:17:18,120
That it'll always be!

5305
06:17:19,760 --> 06:17:21,280
It'll always be!

5306
06:17:21,300 --> 06:17:27,080
angry but

5307
06:17:30,560 --> 06:17:44,600

Odin yeah you set anger out on Odin that's what I do I do

5308
06:17:44,600 --> 06:17:52,700

5309
06:17:57,820 --> 06:18:11,570

to me not for that

5310
06:18:17,450 --> 06:18:21,290

5311
06:18:25,920 --> 06:18:37,980
do not regret saving your life and never will but the choice
between life and death should have been yours to make i

5312
06:18:37,980 --> 06:18:39,780
should not have robbed you of that choice

5313
06:18:43,600 --> 06:18:44,880
friendship now

5314
06:18:56,170 --> 06:18:57,490

5319
06:19:38,280 --> 06:19:38,280

I suppose it's time.

5324
06:19:55,530 --> 06:19:57,070
Oh, now it's time to exploit.

5325
06:19:57,170 --> 06:19:57,970
Now there's time.

5326
06:19:57,990 --> 06:19:58,770
to explain.

5327
06:19:59,650 --> 06:20:02,690
I guess it might be weird to explain while you're in bird
form.

5328
06:20:04,490 --> 06:20:06,470
Let me live with that for a moment.

5329

06:22:12,490 --> 06:22:13,470
Oh my god, he's rolling down.

5362
06:22:13,510 --> 06:22:14,250
You think he's dead?

5363
06:22:15,110 --> 06:22:15,750
Alright, there you go.

5364
06:22:20,290 --> 06:22:22,090
Oh my god, are you fucking kidding me?

5365
06:22:22,170 --> 06:22:23,510
Yeah, that's fucking... Are you deserved that?

5366
06:22:23,530 --> 06:22:24,450
Get comboed!

5367
06:22:25,650 --> 06:22:26,270
Where is he?

5368
06:22:26,310 --> 06:22:26,710
Yeah!

5369
06:22:29,770 --> 06:22:32,230
Oh shit, that was sick.

5370
06:22:32,450 --> 06:22:37,110
All right, now I got a rock for you.

5371
06:22:41,130 --> 06:22:41,870
Yeah!

5372
06:22:43,250 --> 06:22:45,030
Send Odin my regards.

5373
06:22:46,010 --> 06:22:47,950
You use your anger effectively.

5374
06:22:48,470 --> 06:22:50,030
Oh, he's just like me!

5375
06:22:50,650 --> 06:22:52,790
Oh my god, we're bonding with anger.

5376
06:22:54,930 --> 06:22:56,110
We're anger bonding.

5377
06:22:57,990 --> 06:22:58,930
Thank you for the super chat.

5378
06:22:59,110 --> 06:22:59,290
Thank you.

5379
06:22:59,450 --> 06:22:59,830
Thank you.

5380
06:22:59,990 --> 06:23:01,930
I want to be angry with Freya.

5381
06:23:02,610 --> 06:23:03,330
He's my brother.

5382
06:23:04,050 --> 06:23:06,750
He was the most important person in the world to me.

5383
06:23:07,110 --> 06:23:08,290
For half my life.

5384
06:23:09,230 --> 06:23:10,570
You're fucking stupid.

5385
06:23:10,810 --> 06:23:12,810
I'm trying to fucking listen to lore.

5386
06:23:22,830 --> 06:23:24,390
I'll just burn this real quick.

5387
06:23:28,330 --> 06:23:35,990

after my community post uh but it is it is rescheduled

5389
06:23:45,890 --> 06:23:55,290

we're gonna wait until she has that all fixed before we can

5390
06:23:55,290 --> 06:23:56,770

5391
06:24:04,190 --> 06:24:05,470

5392
06:24:08,760 --> 06:24:22,920

frost even in the axe's absence ah the sigils can't hold

5393
06:24:22,920 --> 06:24:32,240
forever let's try again what you just said to adjust our
strategy since there's more than one let's try using a sigil

5394
06:24:42,020 --> 06:24:49,880
oh i'm so stupid i'm so all right it's frozen let's take
care of the rest

5396
06:25:07,040 --> 06:25:09,780
I was like, oh, and I still didn't get it.

5397
06:25:10,080 --> 06:25:11,060
I got it now.

5398
06:25:11,160 --> 06:25:11,940
I got it now.

5399
06:25:12,080 --> 06:25:12,880
I got it now.

5400
06:25:20,920 --> 06:25:22,320
Yeah, I understand.

5401
06:25:27,360 --> 06:25:28,420
I was like, I get it.

5402
06:25:28,720 --> 06:25:29,860
I did not.

5403
06:25:30,540 --> 06:25:31,840
But I get it now.

5404
06:25:32,020 --> 06:25:32,800
I get it now.

5405
06:25:37,480 --> 06:25:38,900
Oh my god.

5406
06:25:40,020 --> 06:25:43,860
Bro, I can't, I'm already, like, I'm gonna just gonna beat
up these fucking flying orbs.

5407
06:25:44,240 --> 06:25:47,420
I have to beat this up.

5408
06:25:47,980 --> 06:25:54,100
I'm like, I have so little HP from standing in the frost
because I did not get it.

5409
06:25:54,140 --> 06:25:56,140
I never think of this place as home again.

5410
06:25:57,560 --> 06:25:59,020
After all that's happened.

5411
06:26:00,460 --> 06:26:02,640
What the fuck is this there?

5412
06:26:07,130 --> 06:26:10,850
Oh my god, that means I will have to backtrack to this area
too.

5413
06:26:20,340 --> 06:26:21,920
What the fuck?

5414
06:26:26,320 --> 06:26:27,900
Skull and Hardy are in Vanaheim.

5415
06:26:28,240 --> 06:26:29,740
Did he just destroy the moon?

5416
06:26:29,740 --> 06:26:31,960
The giants rescued them from Odin and brought them here.

5417
06:26:32,800 --> 06:26:33,080
And look.

5418
06:26:34,380 --> 06:26:36,360
The sunlight wakes the sleeping roots.

5419
06:26:37,720 --> 06:26:39,680
See how they stretch to welcome the sun.

5420
06:26:40,940 --> 06:26:41,280
Oh.

5421
06:26:42,360 --> 06:26:43,340
Beautiful, no.

5422
06:26:44,840 --> 06:26:47,540
A far cry from the sheets of Midgard snow.

5423
06:26:47,740 --> 06:26:48,800
Is this woes?

5424
06:26:49,420 --> 06:26:50,820
There's the woes.

5425
06:26:51,680 --> 06:26:56,080
Oh, yeah, it's the wolves from the prophecy or from the
lore.

5426
06:26:56,800 --> 06:27:00,140
At least the whole realm hasn't fallen to predators and
occupiers.

5427
06:27:01,180 --> 06:27:02,220
That is beautiful.

5428
06:27:02,680 --> 06:27:03,820
Something to be fought for here.

5429
06:27:04,440 --> 06:27:06,460
Something to defend even after so much damage.

5430
06:27:06,480 --> 06:27:07,840
The moon was like, oh, shit.

5431
06:27:08,720 --> 06:27:10,560
Maybe that goes for Freyr, too.

5432
06:27:11,980 --> 06:27:12,780
That is beautiful.

5433
06:27:14,240 --> 06:27:16,900
Yeah, we saw that in the beginning of the game.

5434
06:27:19,000 --> 06:27:20,280
That's pretty funny.

5435
06:27:20,580 --> 06:27:21,360
The moon's like, fuck!

5436
06:27:21,800 --> 06:27:23,680
They're back!

5437
06:27:27,840 --> 06:27:31,240
All right, what are these?

5438
06:27:36,800 --> 06:27:39,740
What the fuck is that?

5439
06:27:43,260 --> 06:27:45,340
Stupid goddamn plants.

5440
06:27:45,660 --> 06:27:46,380
Kratos, I see something.

5441
06:27:51,200 --> 06:27:51,860
What?

5442
06:27:53,360 --> 06:27:56,580
You won't be able to damage it without destroying the
mother.

5443
06:27:57,180 --> 06:27:58,500
It's a large bulbous thing.

5444
06:27:58,680 --> 06:27:59,440
You can't miss it.

5445
06:28:00,140 --> 06:28:00,460
This?

5446
06:28:04,500 --> 06:28:06,740
That's a large bulbous thing.

5447
06:28:10,560 --> 06:28:11,720
There we go.

5448
06:28:13,980 --> 06:28:15,780
I was gonna say that has to be it.

5449
06:28:17,140 --> 06:28:19,780
It was my fucking thing just didn't have range.

5450
06:28:23,170 --> 06:28:25,090
I think it was just destroy it.

5451
06:28:25,110 --> 06:28:37,730
what is this i don't know but giants definitely crafted it
there's two wolves represented here perhaps a connection to

5452
06:28:37,730 --> 06:28:46,850
our friends in the sky a mystery for another time yes two
wolves that chased the thingy all

5453
06:28:57,150 --> 06:28:59,050
right down we go

5454
06:29:03,010 --> 06:29:11,410
axe and disabled shields oh my sigils can break through Oh
shit, nice!

5455
06:29:14,170 --> 06:29:14,890
Nice!

5456
06:29:16,110 --> 06:29:17,550
Are we to Elemental?

5457
06:29:18,770 --> 06:29:19,490
Try...

5458
06:29:19,490 --> 06:29:21,050
And then...

5459
06:29:21,050 --> 06:29:21,370
Oh!

5460
06:29:21,910 --> 06:29:23,710
I should have tried that.

5461
06:29:24,790 --> 06:29:25,490
Next time.

5462
06:29:27,410 --> 06:29:29,610
And by next time, me now!

5463
06:29:30,190 --> 06:29:30,470
Whoa!

5464
06:29:33,570 --> 06:29:36,650
Oh my god, but fuck these guys though.

5465
06:29:40,950 --> 06:29:41,490
Yeah.

5466
06:29:43,110 --> 06:29:44,370
Wait, where is my thing?

5467
06:29:44,510 --> 06:29:46,810
Oh my god, I have no HP right now.

5468
06:29:47,170 --> 06:29:48,610
This is really bad, actually.

5469
06:29:51,390 --> 06:29:53,470
Oh, please tell me you give it HP.

5470
06:29:53,930 --> 06:29:56,710
I am very poor right now.

5471
06:29:59,710 --> 06:30:01,670
Oh, please tell me you have HP.

5472
06:30:02,070 --> 06:30:03,690
I really need HP.

5473
06:30:04,570 --> 06:30:04,770
No!

5474
06:30:05,230 --> 06:30:06,070
Enemy behind you, Kratos.

5475
06:30:07,550 --> 06:30:08,230
It's okay.

5476
06:30:10,390 --> 06:30:13,230
Oh my god, one of you must have HP!

5477
06:30:16,770 --> 06:30:17,590
Where am I?

5478
06:30:18,150 --> 06:30:19,090
Oh, there's shit.

5479
06:30:19,990 --> 06:30:22,210
Oh, nice, that's good.

5480
06:30:23,470 --> 06:30:23,870
What?

5481
06:30:24,110 --> 06:30:24,630
That's okay!

5482
06:30:24,830 --> 06:30:25,530
That is not good!

5483
06:30:25,770 --> 06:30:26,930
That is not good!

5484
06:30:27,330 --> 06:30:28,950
That is absolutely not good!

5485
06:30:29,830 --> 06:30:31,090
Okay, okay.

5486
06:30:31,590 --> 06:30:32,110
This is bad.

5487
06:30:32,270 --> 06:30:33,070
This is actually bad.

5488
06:30:36,070 --> 06:30:37,510
It is no longer good.

5489
06:30:43,580 --> 06:30:44,840
Oh, guys, let's get him out of it.

5490
06:30:44,940 --> 06:30:45,560
Let's get him out of it.

5491
06:30:46,440 --> 06:30:48,120
I am so low HP right now.

5492
06:30:49,280 --> 06:30:51,220
Oh, fuck all guns, don't replace.

5493
06:30:53,360 --> 06:30:54,500
Enemy to your left.

5494
06:30:55,000 --> 06:30:55,320
What?

5495
06:30:58,920 --> 06:30:59,220
Okay.

5496
06:31:00,640 --> 06:31:02,000
I'm staying over here.

5497
06:31:04,180 --> 06:31:05,580
I'm staying over here.

5498
06:31:06,400 --> 06:31:07,320
Oh, this is the last.

5499
06:31:07,380 --> 06:31:07,920
That's good.

5500
06:31:13,820 --> 06:31:15,540
Guys, I am not using...

5501
06:31:15,560 --> 06:31:27,780
saying yeah yeah oh god it's all right just a little almost
got a heart attack no no i gotta save it guys who wait we

5502
06:31:27,780 --> 06:31:38,000
might have a boss fight later guys we gotta save it i'm not
even sure where to begin what do you want from him an

5503
06:31:38,000 --> 06:31:47,060
apology would be a start i want to forgive him i'd like to
think he's changed He's all I have left now.

5504
06:31:48,140 --> 06:31:49,240
Jeremy, thank you for the raid.

5505
06:31:49,800 --> 06:31:50,120
Thank you.

5506
06:31:50,180 --> 06:31:51,060
Oh, we had a good stream.

5507
06:31:51,200 --> 06:31:54,220
It is difficult to seek forgiveness when you feel unworthy.

5508
06:31:59,080 --> 06:32:00,760
Oh, are you back home yet?

5509
06:32:01,460 --> 06:32:02,860
Now, how to get across?

5510
06:32:06,220 --> 06:32:10,400
Chain elements to where it's hard, and they grow in size and
grow bigger when chained together.

5511
06:32:10,500 --> 06:32:13,600
My sigil arrow should be able to carry the fire across the
river to reach the bramble.

5512
06:32:15,500 --> 06:32:16,000
I knew it.

5513
06:32:16,000 --> 06:32:17,120
I knew there was loot here.

5514
06:32:17,700 --> 06:32:22,180
else would there be a random place here okay play sigil

5515
06:32:26,290 --> 06:32:31,350
think larger and brighter when connected and then here

5516
06:32:37,280 --> 06:32:38,940
is that big enough

5517
06:32:43,610 --> 06:32:48,600
oh my god okay okay let me let me think

5518
06:32:53,360 --> 06:32:57,440
I can't reach it

5519
06:33:10,590 --> 06:33:15,070
Wow what if

5520
06:33:23,670 --> 06:33:29,530
I'll be able to reach it eventually right Okay

5521
06:33:42,960 --> 06:33:44,240
Okay, it's fine.

5522
06:33:44,620 --> 06:33:45,580
It is fine.

5523
06:33:50,150 --> 06:33:51,450
I can't reach that.

5524
06:33:51,550 --> 06:33:52,470
What do you mean, swing over?

5525
06:33:52,590 --> 06:33:53,190
Look at this.

5526
06:33:58,840 --> 06:33:59,180
Wait.

5527
06:33:59,660 --> 06:34:00,560
Wait, I'll get it.

5528
06:34:00,580 --> 06:34:01,210
I'll get it.

5529
06:34:02,220 --> 06:34:02,280
I'll get it.

5530
06:34:02,380 --> 06:34:03,020
I'll get it.

5531
06:34:08,080 --> 06:34:08,580
Surely.

5532
06:34:10,920 --> 06:34:12,520
I don't get it.

5533
06:34:43,060 --> 06:34:44,980
What can I touch?

5534
06:34:46,340 --> 06:34:47,080
Can I touch this?

5535
06:34:47,880 --> 06:34:50,680
Oh my god, I get it.

5536
06:34:51,100 --> 06:34:52,020
I get it now.

5537
06:35:01,180 --> 06:35:02,480
I get it.

5538
06:35:02,940 --> 06:35:03,720
I get it.

5539
06:35:04,200 --> 06:35:04,980
I get it.

5540
06:35:04,980 --> 06:35:05,440
I get it!

5541
06:35:05,580 --> 06:35:07,240
Oh my god, I got it!

5542
06:35:07,340 --> 06:35:08,180
For the unworthy.

5543
06:35:09,320 --> 06:35:11,240
My wife, Faye, taught me that.

5544
06:35:11,960 --> 06:35:12,200
Hmm.

5545
06:35:12,740 --> 06:35:18,420
Well, be glad you have a spouse to remember fondly.

5546
06:35:20,460 --> 06:35:20,740
Spouses.

5547
06:35:23,860 --> 06:35:24,660
What the fuck?

5548
06:35:25,140 --> 06:35:25,220
Oh.

5549
06:35:26,700 --> 06:35:29,740
Did you see me?

5550
06:35:36,220 --> 06:35:38,720
Oh, unleash poison?

5551
06:35:41,180 --> 06:35:43,120
Wait, I just use this.

5552
06:35:47,970 --> 06:35:49,610
Oh, shit, that's the poison.

5553
06:35:50,210 --> 06:35:50,590
Nice.

5554
06:35:51,090 --> 06:35:52,450
Wait, Freya's OP.

5555
06:35:57,450 --> 06:35:59,050
I fucking don't trust this shit.

5556
06:36:00,570 --> 06:36:01,950
Bro, she's so sure.

5557
06:36:02,150 --> 06:36:04,270
She has fucking poison, too?

5558
06:36:08,590 --> 06:36:09,650
Oh, my God.

5559
06:36:09,810 --> 06:36:10,290
Oh, my God.

5560
06:36:10,430 --> 06:36:11,010
Oh, rage!

5561
06:36:14,130 --> 06:36:15,150
Oh, my God.

5562
06:36:15,510 --> 06:36:15,830
Rage!

5563
06:36:18,530 --> 06:36:20,290
There you go.

5564
06:36:20,930 --> 06:36:21,670
It's fine.

5565
06:36:22,110 --> 06:36:22,630
I got rage.

5566
06:36:24,590 --> 06:36:29,230
Oh my god, I got more rage.

5567
06:36:29,730 --> 06:36:31,230
Why do none of them give HP?

5568
06:36:36,960 --> 06:36:38,420
Wait, there's HP right here.

5569
06:36:39,080 --> 06:36:39,520
Okay, nice.

5570
06:36:39,880 --> 06:36:40,980
I should kill him automatically.

5571
06:36:43,800 --> 06:36:45,380
Oh, thank god, now they give HP.

5572
06:36:47,680 --> 06:36:48,200
Oh.

5573
06:36:49,340 --> 06:36:50,340
Thank God.

5574
06:36:52,700 --> 06:36:53,440
I feel like I was...

5575
06:36:53,440 --> 06:36:56,560
I swear to God, I was playing with like 0 HP for that entire
time.

5576
06:36:58,260 --> 06:36:58,860
Yeah!

5577
06:37:03,770 --> 06:37:04,130
Uh.

5578
06:37:04,690 --> 06:37:05,070
TP!

5579
06:37:08,870 --> 06:37:10,490
Left or right?

5580
06:37:14,350 --> 06:37:15,790
I go...

5581
06:37:15,790 --> 06:37:16,470
This way.

5582
06:37:20,790 --> 06:37:22,850
There was no hidden loot this time.

5583
06:37:31,470 --> 06:37:58,150
yeah I time for the brother and sister meaning wait no I'm
going the right way I'm not going the right way I see the

5584
06:37:58,150 --> 06:38:00,950
numbers going getting further and further

5585
06:38:04,250 --> 06:38:07,350
I was like, Luke Kickoff is like, why are the numbers going
up?

5586
06:38:07,890 --> 06:38:09,250
That's weird.

5587
06:38:10,610 --> 06:38:12,370
That's weird.

5588
06:38:14,990 --> 06:38:18,270
I'm going the right way now.

5589
06:38:21,030 --> 06:38:21,490
Yay.

5590
06:38:25,750 --> 06:38:29,910
I just...

5591
06:38:31,710 --> 06:38:33,550
Okay, now...

5592
06:38:33,550 --> 06:38:36,550
Now I should be going...

5593
06:38:36,570 --> 06:38:41,350
the right way what

5594
06:38:45,990 --> 06:38:59,370
yeah was that there's no limit to the depths to which a soul
can sink into darkness tricked me into marriage to spare my

5595
06:38:59,370 --> 06:39:08,130
home and took my home just the same scattered my people to
the wind maybe it's time somebody drew the line maybe it's

5596
06:39:08,130 --> 06:39:12,330
time someone makes grow as Okay, but does anyone actually
like Odin though?

5597
06:39:12,350 --> 06:39:13,490
I would not wish for war, Freya.

5598
06:39:14,170 --> 06:39:15,790
War is a terrible thing, Kratos.

5599
06:39:16,850 --> 06:39:19,570
But some things are even worse.

5600
06:39:21,530 --> 06:39:26,190
You know, if Atreus rushes to Ragnarok, you may not be able
to stop him.

5601
06:39:26,570 --> 06:39:27,090
I will.

5602
06:39:27,670 --> 06:39:28,430
And if you fail?

5603
06:39:28,950 --> 06:39:32,590
I have prepared him to survive without me, if he must.

5604
06:39:35,770 --> 06:39:36,970
Raven Crooks.

5605
06:39:37,330 --> 06:39:38,450
Aw, he's watching.

5606
06:39:39,070 --> 06:39:39,670
Aw.

5607
06:39:40,630 --> 06:39:41,430
Always watching.

5608
06:39:43,590 --> 06:39:46,050
Oh my gosh, swear to God, am I going backwards again?

5609
06:39:48,770 --> 06:39:51,050
I have to, I don't trust myself.

5610
06:39:53,630 --> 06:39:54,370
No, it's fine.

5611
06:39:54,550 --> 06:39:55,090
Okay, it's here.

5612
06:40:01,000 --> 06:40:01,920
Oh, yeah, loot.

5613
06:40:08,200 --> 06:40:09,280
Watch for the plants.

5614
06:40:09,840 --> 06:40:12,300
They like me, but strangers, not so much.

5615
06:40:12,680 --> 06:40:13,480
I see that.

5616
06:40:15,300 --> 06:40:40,620
the right way this time god damn it i swear to god i will
hit this there we go that's her get out of here i don't get

5617
06:40:40,620 --> 06:40:43,120
anything from this but i stop Fuck you guys.

5618
06:40:47,210 --> 06:40:49,370
I know I could just ran past it, but you don't fuck that.

5619
06:40:50,950 --> 06:40:52,090
This was worth it.

5620
06:40:52,390 --> 06:40:53,230
Oh, I was here.

5621
06:40:53,790 --> 06:40:55,310
Oh, I'm literally just going backwards.

5622
06:41:01,780 --> 06:41:02,900
And let me even burn this.

5623
06:41:03,720 --> 06:41:04,040
No.

5624
06:41:06,640 --> 06:41:07,620
What's this then?

5625
06:41:07,660 --> 06:41:09,160
We don't have the equipment for this.

5626
06:41:10,360 --> 06:41:10,840
Unlucky.

5627
06:41:10,980 --> 06:41:11,300
What's next for you?

5628
06:41:11,700 --> 06:41:13,000
If not preparing for war.

5629
06:41:13,460 --> 06:41:14,420
Now fuck those plants.

5630
06:41:14,880 --> 06:41:16,500
I'm not going to lose to Salad.

5631
06:41:16,740 --> 06:41:17,240
With Atreus.

5632
06:41:17,820 --> 06:41:21,540
Well, you may want to think fast unless you want someone to
make that choice for you

5633
06:41:31,860 --> 06:41:36,180
Ready as I ever will be all right time to talk to your

Last Project Zomboid stream for members is on Monday.

5689
06:48:53,430 --> 06:48:55,230
We're going to have a big battle royale.

5690
06:48:55,550 --> 06:48:57,190
I'm going to enable friendly fire.

5691
06:48:57,610 --> 06:48:59,870
And then we're all going to start shooting each other.

5692
06:49:00,010 --> 06:49:01,110
And I will be on God mode.

5693

06:49:02,810 --> 06:49:08,130
So if you're a member, our last Project Zomboid stream is on
Monday.

I think after that, the next member stream will be a Men in
Black watch along.

5697
06:49:13,930 --> 06:49:15,530
Because I really want to watch Men in Black.
