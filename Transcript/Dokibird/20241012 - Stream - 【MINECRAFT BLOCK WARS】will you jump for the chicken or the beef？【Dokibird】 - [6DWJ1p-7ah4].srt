1
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,560
Hello everybody.

2
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,480
Hello, hello everyone.

3
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,700
Oh my gosh, wait, the game's a little loud.

4
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,440
Let me turn that down a little bit.

5
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,080
Alright, so we have a little bit of bad news.

6
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,540
We don't know where Gumi is.

7
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,020
Um, and uh...

8
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,240
We don't know where she is right now.

9
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,840
We don't think she's awake.

10
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,540
That's like her only...

11
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,000
She's not in the VC.

12
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:20,040
She's, she's actually, she's not in the VC, guys.

13
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,080
So, so by the way, um, this is what I look like.

14
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,960
It's, we're all Halloween skins.

15
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,460
So this is what I look like right now.

16
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,640
I think I'm a vampire.

17
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,720
No, I'm a zombie.

18
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,480
I think I'm a zombie.

19
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:41,520
I think, no, one of our carries is not here.

20
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,800
I'm so scared.

21
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:53,880
So, um, so that is our, that is our first issue.

22
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,480
So there's Giga.

23
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,680
She's a mummy.

24
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,520
I'm a, I'm a zombie.

25
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,800
We're, we're, our team is like Halloween themed.

26
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,380
Um, I watched a video of what our games are gonna be like.

27
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:13,320
And like, um, the first three, the first three games sound so, so easy to understand.

28
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,000
And then they lost me after that.

29
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:22,900
And then I kept watching and then it lost, and then I got lost.

30
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,200
And then I was like, oh, wait, is this unlisted?

31
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:26,800
It's not.

32
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,120
Okay.

33
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:33,620
So this is what the games, this is, this is what the games are gonna be like.

34
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,880
I was gonna say, is this unlisted?

35
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:35,620
But it's not.

36
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,640
So like, that means you guys can see it too.

37
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,820
What the fuck?

38
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,520
Is that from the game?

39
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,120
Is there in-game music?

40
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,400
Is this, is this in-game music?

41
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,620
Okay, that like scared me.

42
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,200
I was like, what the fuck?

43
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,900
Okay, let me turn that down.

44
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,320
That's way too loud for in-game music.

45
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,300
Where's the rest of my team?

46
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:14,920
What's the, but yeah, you're gonna see the game, you watch the video and it was like, and it was like, I was like, oh, hey, ain't nothing so bad.

47
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,860
We go down.

48
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,120
I can do that going down.

49
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,020
We just jumped down until like, and the other one was like, oh, hey, like rob banks and robbers.

50
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,680
We just rob a bank.

51
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:34,800
And, and then, um, and, and then like, and I had to spoil myself because I didn't know how to fuck to play these games.

52
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,600
And I was like, oh, that's easy.

53
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,020
We just robbed the bank and then go back.

54
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,140
And then, and then it got weird.

55
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,720
And then, and then it got fucking weird.

56
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,960
And I was just like, what are these other games?

57
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,200
And I was like, looking at it, I was like, what the fuck?

58
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:59,400
What did these fancy words mean?

59
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,220
I'm so confused.

60
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,320
I was just like, wait, what?

61
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,140
I don't understand the last, like, four, three to four other games.

62
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:18,180
I don't even know which one is like the other games after that, because they all blurred in together.

63
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,420
So I was like, the fuck is that?

64
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:28,380
Like there's, there's ice underneath.

65
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,420
What do you mean there's ice?

66
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,280
What am I supposed to do with the ice underneath?

67
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,120
The classes?

68
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:32,980
What do you mean?

69
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,960
Oh, support classes now give you points.

70
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,740
But like, what, what am I supposed to do with that information?

71
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,320
Like, what is the objective?

72
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,180
And I'm just like, I was like, what the fuck?

73
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:55,500
And then I remembered, I asked like one of the organizers, I asked one of the organizers, and I was like, hey, is there like a practice map?

74
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,200
And they're like, well, people in your skill level tend to go in blind.

75
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,060
And no, we don't have any practice maps.

76
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,500
So we do, you can, I can take you to some like mini game maps.

77
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,320
So you can like play around with those.

78
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:11,300
And I was like, oh, I guess I go in blind then.

79
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:20,100
I'm just like, well, guess I'm just gonna experience it live.

80
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:22,860
Just...

81
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,840
All right, let me unmute myself real quick.

82
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:27,820
Hello?

83
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,000
Hello?

84
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:30,320
Hello?

85
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,260
Yo.

86
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,520
So I think, I think Gumi's asleep.

87
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,620
I don't think, I don't think she's alive.

88
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:48,560
So that's an issue because usually she's not alive at this hour.

89
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,960
Let me see if I can ping Snap.

90
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,160
Like, I don't actually...

91
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,980
I mean, I could call her.

92
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,300
Wait, has anyone called her yet?

93
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,660
No, no.

94
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,120
Yeah, I'll call her and see.

95
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,700
Because I don't know.

96
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,120
I don't know where the fuck she is.

97
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,280
All right, guys.

98
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:13,220
I've been like praying that either of them respond, but I messaged both and it happened.

99
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,500
All right, we're calling Gumi.

100
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,640
We're gonna wake her up.

101
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,240
She's on do not disturb.

102
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,100
So like, there's hope.

103
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,560
There's hope.

104
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:32,520
She's not answering, which is weird because that's usually my thing.

105
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,720
That's usually something I do.

106
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,700
Is Sound Guy live as well?

107
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,340
Oh wait, I could.

108
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,280
I could call her.

109
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:45,960
All right.

110
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,160
Oh, she's not answering.

111
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,460
Okay, I could call her cell phone.

112
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,900
All right, give me a sec, guys.

113
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,720
I'm gonna be... I'm gonna call her cell phone.

114
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,380
I could.

115
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,020
I'm gonna call an American phone right now.

116
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,420
I'm calling her cell phone now.

117
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,380
Well, you hear that?

118
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,540
I should mute this.

119
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,840
Okay, Gumi's awake.

120
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,480
Gumi's awake.

121
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,520
She thought it was 12.

122
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,540
She thought...

123
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,560
You're on stream, by the way.

124
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,400
You're on stream.

125
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,160
It's right now.

126
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,060
It's literally right now.

127
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,040
We're waiting for you.

128
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,980
Okay, okay.

129
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,640
It's like, we're all like, oh no, like, where is she?

130
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,300
But just so you know, you're on stream.

131
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,280
Don't say anything, but she's alive.

132
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,380
She's alive.

133
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,120
All right, we'll see you on the server.

134
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,240
All right, bye.

135
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:09,260
She's like, I thought it was supposed to be on 12.

136
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,180
I'm like, no, we're right here.

137
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,660
Okay, I called her cell phone.

138
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,500
She's awake.

139
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,700
She thought it was at 12.

140
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,040
She's... I called her cell phone, but she's here.

141
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:23,500
She's here.

142
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,220
She's getting on.

143
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,180
Let's go.

144
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,160
Okay, wait.

145
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,040
Perfect, perfect.

146
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,320
All right, so we don't need a sub.

147
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,720
We got Gumi in.

148
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,800
That's a crazy clutch.

149
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:36,700
I was about to get the Mr. President Poundcake who was on the toilet, so this is insane.

150
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,060
He's so good at these subs.

151
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,900
Mr. President Poundcake?

152
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,420
Is that a real person?

153
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,300
That's the best microspeeder in the world, by the way.

154
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,440
Oh, okay, wait.

155
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,480
Let me call Gumi again.

156
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,240
Let me... That was a lie, by the way.

157
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:55,920
You might be the worst.

158
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:56,780
I'm not gonna lie.

159
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,160
I'm just saying, if we're gonna get the best Minecraft speedrunner, I think she'd understand.

160
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,720
No, the best microspeeder is on our team right now.

161
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,320
He's in the VC.

162
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,280
Oh, shit.

163
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:10,560
What?

164
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:11,280
No.

165
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,420
Oh, shit, you're number one?

166
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:21,720
I think the last two block wars, I had Purpled on my team, and every time he's like, hey, can you go into the chat and just say, this was Feinberg's fault?

167
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,420
He was saying it every time, and I was like, Jesus.

168
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,480
But I would do it.

169
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,100
But today, we flipped the script.

170
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:32,400
I have to find someone else to bother in chat after every round.

171
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,400
No, you can still blame him.

172
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:33,660
I think.

173
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:34,820
You can still...

174
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,840
If we lose... Yeah.

175
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,680
Yeah, yeah, every time we lose, it's his fault, remember?

176
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,500
He couldn't carry us hard enough.

177
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,360
Joe Bart did this.

178
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,900
It's like, why didn't you help us win?

179
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,480
It's never my fault.

180
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,160
Exactly.

181
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,260
It's never...

182
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:52,720
Exactly.

183
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,080
It's... We're not Minecraft players.

184
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:54,900
It's not our fault.

185
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,660
Like, they should know the risk when they invited us.

186
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,880
True, true.

187
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,740
Okay, but I go crazy in Blitz hunt for no reason, so...

188
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,380
The fuck is Blitz?

189
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,200
I'll carry you for one.

190
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,520
Oh, yeah, yeah.

191
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:12,740
Sorry, I never played any of these minigames before, so what the fuck is Blitz?

192
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,320
Are you in game?

193
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,540
I can show you.

194
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,720
There's a... There's an area that literally has a all the games.

195
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,540
Oh, shit.

196
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,680
I don't remember where it is, though.

197
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,020
One sec.

198
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,040
Wait, where are you?

199
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:21,740
I can't tell.

200
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,780
There's so many names.

201
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,000
Hello.

202
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,460
Okay, there you go.

203
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:23,740
Hi.

204
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:24,940
I'm the skeleton guy.

205
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,900
Oh, wait, you're the... You're literally the organizer.

206
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,000
Wait, you can rig the matches, technically.

207
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:29,520
No!

208
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,240
Yes!

209
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:31,540
Yes!

210
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,500
Let us win or you're never invited.

211
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,160
Okay, it's over here.

212
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:38,460
Hold on.

213
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,300
If you jump on this, you go...

214
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:41,900
Yeah.

215
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,420
Yeah, that's tip one.

216
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,960
How did you get so far?

217
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:47,860
I've been...

218
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,060
There's everything in the cave here.

219
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,240
Every game of all time is...

220
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,660
Okay, so... You got a lot of reading to do here.

221
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,020
Oh, wait, it's just reading?

222
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,840
It's not even...

223
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,560
Yeah, you just read it.

224
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,820
You said we get to try out the games.

225
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,380
Oh, did I say that?

226
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,640
You kind of did say it like that.

227
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:16,000
Yeah, you were like, oh, I can't wait to try out these games.

228
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,620
You take me there to fucking read.

229
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,020
How can you do this?

230
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,980
Oh my god, Gumi, no way!

231
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,220
I don't know how to read.

232
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,700
No, we not die, do I?

233
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,300
I have to read how to play these games.

234
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,020
Gumi, have you... You've done these... You've done block wars before, right?

235
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,300
Yeah.

236
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,520
Don't we have videos for it?

237
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,360
Okay, I'm the weakest link.

238
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,040
Okay, that's good.

239
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,160
There are videos, but that takes a bit long, maybe.

240
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,720
There are also tutorials for everything.

241
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,280
Okay, wait, I'll give you...

242
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:44,920
Are you the weakest link?

243
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,420
I'll give you the fastest intro ever.

244
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,420
Wait, you've played, right, Gumi?

245
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:52,980
Yes.

246
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,160
Okay, okay, okay.

247
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,500
All right, so we're all right.

248
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,200
We'll be okay.

249
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,920
It's okay, it's fine.

250
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,080
Last time Gumi played, she did better than me, so...

251
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,800
Oh, that's great.

252
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,520
That's good to know.

253
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,120
That's good to know.

254
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,400
Gumi, just so you know, I stopped them from replacing you.

255
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,720
I was there.

256
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,200
I clutched it for you.

257
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,380
Wow, you're my hero.

258
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:18,480
I was gonna get like a temporary sub until Gumi woke up, but Gumi woke up before I did.

259
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,940
My alarm just went off.

260
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,040
Oh my goodness.

261
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:21,680
That's awesome.

262
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:23,880
Thank god.

263
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,420
All right, let's see.

264
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,460
Wait, so what are the games...

265
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,380
Is this all the games we're playing today or just...

266
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,300
Okay, I thought it was like five.

267
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,340
This one is optional.

268
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,780
Well, not optional.

269
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,080
It's more like if we do really good, we play this one.

270
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,740
Okay, so the top two teams.

271
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,520
Okay, so I don't have to read that then.

272
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,460
It's not optional.

273
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,660
It's optional to win, but it's not optional to play.

274
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,920
We're gonna do it.

275
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,640
We could just send you into hero mode.

276
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,680
God, there's eight games.

277
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,080
Okay, okay.

278
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,500
All right, so like if...

279
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,680
It doesn't matter if I fuck up, right?

280
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,780
Like this is not that team oriented.

281
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:00,780
Okay, that's good.

282
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,860
I'm gonna be sweaty, but not mad.

283
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,340
You know what I mean?

284
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,440
Okay, that's good.

285
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,940
Because we all agreed to blame Feinberg in the end, right?

286
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,860
Yeah, I'm done.

287
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,080
I'm cool with that, yeah.

288
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,800
Yeah, yeah.

289
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:22,200
How dare this professional Minecraft player can't carry me.

290
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:29,780
Is there any like thing in Minecraft that you're like good at?

291
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,020
Or have you played the game before?

292
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,400
Have you played this game?

293
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,960
That's a good question.

294
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:46,700
I think it's best that we go in thinking that I am like a newborn baby right now.

295
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,160
Wait, I know how to shift and I know how to run.

296
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,520
Okay, that's good.

297
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,800
That's a start.

298
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,100
I saw you play in, I think it was what, House of Nightmares?

299
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,180
Yeah, the Haunted House.

300
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:58,900
Yeah, we made it.

301
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,320
Goomy and I made it pretty far.

302
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,360
To be fair, it was Goomy dragging me to the finish line.

303
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:10,000
But I was ready to get knocked out, but she dragged me kicking and screaming.

304
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,090
Okay, wait.

305
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:15,830
Oh, we're waiting on HandsomeFella.

306
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:16,390
Where is that?

307
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,890
Oh, yeah, it's not even me.

308
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:19,630
It's not me.

309
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,630
It's chill though, like the event typically starts late.

310
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:25,690
I think I'm pissing off the admins.

311
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,310
You're pissing off the admins?

312
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,490
Which game is finished?

313
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:29,810
There's three admins watching me.

314
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:33,790
So we vote for the games, we're gonna get sent to like a dome.

315
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,970
It'll explain it in the intro.

316
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,910
We get sent to like a dome, you stand in a slice.

317
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,110
And then you vote for the game by standing in the slice.

318
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,130
However, there are sabotages.

319
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,530
You can get like a cat that counts for an extra vote.

320
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,410
You can get a knife, you can kill somebody.

321
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:50,290
Or you can spawn a monster that kills the entire lobby.

322
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,870
So we'll see.

323
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:52,670
Oh, ready check.

324
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:53,810
There you go.

325
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:58,550
Yeah, oh, and it'll show before each game, it'll show like a little video.

326
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:01,750
I thought there was like a coding going down game mode.

327
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:02,650
It's not even on here.

328
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,330
It's in party.

329
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,130
Oh, it's party?

330
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:05,930
Oh, that's party?

331
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,110
Oh, okay.

332
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,110
Yeah, there's like a mini game.

333
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,430
That's just four mini games.

334
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:13,570
Wolfie, I'm so excited for party, man.

335
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:16,690
I love the new, like the updated one.

336
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,290
It looks so good.

337
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,470
I thought this was...

338
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:22,310
I thought this was Sane's music for one second.

339
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,590
Yeah, we should check cook food for you.

340
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,130
Oh my god, there's Overcooked.

341
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,570
Yeah, Order Up is Overcooked.

342
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:31,290
Okay, here, I'll give you the games that they basically are.

343
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,050
So, Order Up is Overcooked.

344
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:33,550
Okay.

345
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,650
Party has that falling down one.

346
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,030
It also has Splatoon in it.

347
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:39,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's got Splatoon, so it looks so fun.

348
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:40,370
Yeah.

349
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,550
Blitz Hunt is Hide and Seek.

350
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,370
Extraction is...

351
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,270
It's just an extraction shooter.

352
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,850
You shoot people and then extract in the middle.

353
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:50,730
Shockwave is Valorant.

354
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,990
Well, that's Valorant, but you get frozen.

355
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,290
Extraction is the one where you take damage and die.

356
00:16:56,710 --> 00:17:00,930
Yeah, Extraction is Death Valorant and Shockwave is Freeze Valorant.

357
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,330
Yes, plus it up.

358
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,850
I like Battle the most, actually.

359
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:10,430
Oh, I guess I'll never know what Spleef is.

360
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,470
I guess I'll never know.

361
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:17,370
If you die first round, you just do better the second round.

362
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:17,750
It's easy.

363
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:18,730
Okay, nice.

364
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:21,950
What the fuck?

365
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:22,890
Oh, I'm just stuck up here.

366
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:23,210
Okay.

367
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:28,450
Oh, it's like a POV of everything.

368
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:29,790
High technology cutscene.

369
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:32,530
Oh my god, that's so cool.

370
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:35,730
You can get one of these for every minigame, so at least you get like a primer on it.

371
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:42,710
Yeah, we get a multiplier to the game score, by the way, at the end of the games, like the later ones.

372
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:43,690
Yeah, higher, right?

373
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,290
Yeah, we get like slight increase.

374
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:49,890
I don't know what our best game is, so we're just gonna go with the flow.

375
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,930
Oh, I can move now, nice.

376
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:53,910
What the fuck is that?

377
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:58,390
Well, they took Parkour out, which I'm really glad about, because that's like my worst bane of my existence.

378
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:59,990
So, we're chilling.

379
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:02,210
Oh, you're gonna get an answer as well.

380
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:04,350
Hey, Doki, that's gonna be you.

381
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,590
Oh, that's gonna be me?

382
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:06,670
Where's me?

383
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,230
Yeah, hurry!

384
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,690
Oh, is it like...

385
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:09,690
Oh, let's go!

386
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:22,750
I said yay for Lee, because I've talked to him before, and then I realized I set a bad precedent, and I feel really bad if I just say yay to everybody else.

387
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:23,430
So, I just...

388
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:27,590
Btmc still has his Power Ranger from the last time.

389
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:30,550
He didn't change his skin at all, it's just yellow now.

390
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,010
Btmc still has pink hair.

391
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:33,690
Oh my God.

392
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:36,750
Everybody has custom skins, that's so cool.

393
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,270
Just for the event.

394
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:41,150
We got some as well, I think.

395
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:41,770
It's just like...

396
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:42,930
Oh my God, the Incredibles.

397
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:44,410
Yeah, ours are good.

398
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,130
You forgot about them?

399
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:46,730
Oh my God, wait, is this FNAF?

400
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:50,250
Yeah, they're FNAF.

401
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:53,270
They're like the Warden from Minecraft.

402
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,050
Oh, that's so cool.

403
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,390
They all slow turn, that was funny.

404
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:00,790
Oh, the...

405
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,110
Oh my God, they're in one piece.

406
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:03,770
Wait, no, they're half one piece.

407
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:04,130
No.

408
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:04,930
They're not coordinated.

409
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:09,830
What's this?

410
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,110
They're purple.

411
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:12,230
They're just purple?

412
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:12,650
Yeah.

413
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,550
How are we?

414
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:20,230
How are we?

415
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:21,490
Spooky scary.

416
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,870
So, this is the dome where we vote.

417
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:27,250
Yeah.

418
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:27,650
Okay.

419
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:29,630
We have to vote...

420
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:29,650
It doesn't matter.

421
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,390
Yeah, it does not matter.

422
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:34,150
Yeah, we'll go in the thing.

423
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,950
If you get a funny item, use the funny item.

424
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,750
And if you don't, then you don't...

425
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,150
I don't know, man.

426
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,710
Like, you just play the...

427
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:40,410
Just walk around.

428
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:41,830
Just walk around, okay.

429
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,250
Oh, yeah, that can happen.

430
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,890
You can get burned by fire in this.

431
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:44,370
I don't know why.

432
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,290
Wait, but like, this is literally just picking a game though, isn't it?

433
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:49,270
Yeah, it is.

434
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,670
Yeah, it's because the order like slightly matters.

435
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:54,850
Like, the games at the very end give more team points.

436
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,850
But it like really doesn't matter.

437
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:58,190
Like, it does, but it doesn't.

438
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,170
So it's just like, whatever.

439
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:02,230
If you're like min-maxing, you try to influence...

440
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:04,890
Yeah, I don't care enough for it to matter.

441
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:06,230
Exactly.

442
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:11,550
Uh, yeah, I forgot that we're voting.

443
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,530
Okay, I got a cat.

444
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:15,930
Oh, I got a molotov.

445
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:17,030
How about a player grapple?

446
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,730
Is there a game that we think you want to get out early?

447
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:19,830
Wait, who's on my head?

448
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,750
I'm gonna kill everyone on battle, because I really want to get out of here.

449
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,030
Who did I kidnap?

450
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,190
I did not kidnap somebody.

451
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:29,190
Uh, I'll vote extraction.

452
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:32,110
But it's not gonna matter, because everyone votes order up.

453
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,110
Like, that happens every single round.

454
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:36,010
I'm going for tomb titans, guys.

455
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:36,390
That's right.

456
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,850
My freaking cat's leaving!

457
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:38,810
No!

458
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:41,230
Fire!

459
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:42,550
Look at that other cat.

460
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:43,770
There's a slime for a cat!

461
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:46,150
Ow, ow.

462
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,750
Yeah, there's one in can-man.

463
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,130
Who had?

464
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,050
There's a slime for some reason.

465
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:53,850
Order up?

466
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:56,650
Um, yeah, this is the cooking one.

467
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:57,510
I love this game.

468
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,970
Wolfie, did you use that light trigger when you played the last couple of times?

469
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:01,870
I used it last time, yeah.

470
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:02,310
Goodbye!

471
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:06,090
Okay, um, you should start with it.

472
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:12,690
This is overcooked, but like...

473
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:13,110
Ohio!

474
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:14,130
Yep.

475
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:15,630
Yeah, it's... I don't know why they did that.

476
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:16,150
Um...

477
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:16,610
I don't know either.

478
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:20,130
So, Wolfie and I are gonna start at...

479
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:23,150
are gonna basically play the whole game, like, at the crafting area.

480
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:25,250
And, like, smelt stuff and craft things and everything.

481
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:30,970
And the rest of you three will be collecting for, like, a majority of the game.

482
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:33,830
And then near the end we can, like, all work together because we'll just have way too much stuff.

483
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:36,490
Okay, so we're just collecting all the food and stuff for you.

484
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:42,710
Yeah, there's... there's all, like, fish, animals, uh, crops, like, leaves for apples.

485
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,030
Um, I think that's it.

486
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:45,390
Okay.

487
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:50,530
So, um, let's have Gumi do, like, the... all the animals.

488
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:55,610
Um, uh, Giga, you can do the crops.

489
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:56,670
All right.

490
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,950
And then Doki, you can kind of do a mix of both.

491
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:01,850
I know that's not, like, a good way to split it up.

492
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:03,210
Um...

493
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:04,230
Just do it based off of need.

494
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,470
You could call out what you need more of.

495
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:06,130
Yeah, yeah.

496
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:08,630
So I do crops and... what?

497
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:09,990
Crops and...

498
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:10,770
Just crops and animals.

499
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,390
Like, yeah, whatever... whatever's, like...

500
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:12,490
Okay.

501
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:14,110
Yeah, basically a little bit of everything.

502
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,390
Like, it'll... it'll reach a point where we have so much stuff.

503
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:19,970
But, like, having extras is really good because you can convert it into...

504
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:21,530
What is it starting, Elytra?

505
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,290
That's... that's for the delivery people.

506
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:26,030
Because we have to...

507
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,830
We do not... we do not have to kill the warden anymore.

508
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:31,190
So we don't have to do the... we have to deliver?

509
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:36,370
No, all you guys are going to do is you guys are going to spend all your time on this side of the farm.

510
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:37,590
This, like, collecting area.

511
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:40,710
And then you're going to come back and you're going to put the items in this chest in the middle.

512
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:43,510
And then Wolfie and I will handle all the order stuff.

513
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,590
All right, I'll just grab everything I can.

514
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,670
I'll just grab anything I can.

515
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:48,810
I'll start left.

516
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:49,870
I'm gonna go right.

517
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,290
If you log in.

518
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,150
All right, here, I'll go.

519
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,130
I got disconnected from the server.

520
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:55,280
Should I have some of the paws, or...?

521
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,430
It's not... ah, it's not a big deal.

522
00:22:58,570 --> 00:22:59,250
It'd be cool if we got those.

523
00:22:59,410 --> 00:22:59,510
Let's kill them?

524
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:01,070
Wait, how do I...

525
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,730
If you just kill them, it'll end up in your inventory.

526
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:05,310
Yeah, if you kill the animals, they should just end up.

527
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:06,750
And then the crops, you should just punch.

528
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,110
I don't have music, it's so quiet.

529
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:14,030
Use those red, uh, jump pads to get around, too.

530
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,070
You can, like, jump between all the crops.

531
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:15,770
I'll kill all of them.

532
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:17,330
Oh, wait, those are sheep.

533
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:18,410
They don't give any...

534
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:19,350
Okay, I'm gonna keep killing.

535
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:21,390
All right.

536
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:23,050
Yeah, just kill all the animals you see.

537
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:24,670
Having extras is never bad.

538
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:25,790
I'm heading back.

539
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,970
Yep, head back, and then put stuff in the chest.

540
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:31,010
And then by the time you get back, everything will be, like, respawned.

541
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:31,950
Yay!

542
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:33,690
Oh, I'll just keep killing...

543
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:35,770
I'll keep killing the cows and the pigs.

544
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,830
I'm getting a bunch of pumpkins right now.

545
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:39,630
Yeah, beautiful.

546
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:41,510
What are the first recipes?

547
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:42,850
What do you need?

548
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,190
All right, it does not matter right now.

549
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,350
We just have to, like, ramp up.

550
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,930
And then Wolfie and I will just go absolutely insane.

551
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:51,450
I assume you, uh, take care of the upgrades, fine?

552
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:53,230
Oh, yeah, I have a stack of mushrooms right now.

553
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:54,530
Okay, the sheep do give stuff.

554
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:55,630
Do give stuff.

555
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:56,970
Uh, can you work on the last order right now?

556
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:58,350
Okay, I now know!

557
00:23:58,930 --> 00:23:59,850
I now know!

558
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:03,290
I'm a little bit laggy, but I'll work on it.

559
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:06,150
All right.

560
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:07,710
I can do the mushrooms, too.

561
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,210
I'm gonna...

562
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:10,870
I'll get the crops with you.

563
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:13,870
Oh, four, okay.

564
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:14,530
Come with me!

565
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:15,990
I'm gonna get pumpkins.

566
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,250
I got the wheat.

567
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:20,610
I'm gaming!

568
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,830
I got two cakes done.

569
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:24,730
I'm gonna run.

570
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:26,350
You're running on the paths to go faster.

571
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:27,950
I'll make another one there.

572
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:31,430
Okay, uh, it should be ready now.

573
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:32,010
Oh, shit, my shirt!

574
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:32,650
I gotta go, I'm gonna get the slime.

575
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:36,150
Oh, I'll get the mushrooms, too.

576
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:36,670
A shroom.

577
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:38,890
I can't see shit.

578
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:42,810
I brought, um...

579
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:43,650
Tons of stuff.

580
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,430
I'm farming, I'm farming.

581
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:51,010
We're just gonna make extra cakes, just so we have them.

582
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:52,730
Sure, sure, sure.

583
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:54,490
Unless we're...

584
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:57,430
Uh, I need to do one golden carrot, and then I can bring the second order.

585
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:00,450
Okay.

586
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:01,810
Here's some mushrooms.

587
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:03,910
Awesome.

588
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:06,410
Uh, I think we're a little low on fish.

589
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:07,290
Not that excited with you.

590
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:08,470
I got some fish!

591
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,570
I'm here to farm!

592
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,530
I also have some fish.

593
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:12,290
Amazing, amazing.

594
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:14,630
I figured people were just coming back with it.

595
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:15,530
That actually was a shame.

596
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:19,690
I'll make sure there will be no more fish in the ocean.

597
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:30,990
I'll make sure to get rid of Mr. Beast's legacy right here.

598
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:33,730
Get all the fish.

599
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:34,910
Fail.

600
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:39,770
Uh, okay.

601
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:40,850
Bread.

602
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,470
Oh my god, I can't get out!

603
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,410
We've got this.

604
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:48,930
You're chilling.

605
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,130
I'm helping.

606
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:51,870
You can pick her out.

607
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:53,250
Yeah, just take her, take her, take her.

608
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:55,690
Is there anything we need more of?

609
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:56,510
I'm a little bit discombobulated.

610
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:59,350
Uh, just everything always.

611
00:25:59,530 --> 00:25:59,830
Okay.

612
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,290
Yeah, just keep doing rounds.

613
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:03,190
Okay, I'll make sure to kill these animals.

614
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:03,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

615
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:05,090
Just literally everything always.

616
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:08,930
I'm just gonna get a bunch of mushrooms, just for fun.

617
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:13,110
I gotta focus the composter real quick, Wolfie.

618
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:17,150
I got, I'll take care of the left order, order two.

619
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:18,490
Oh, it's done.

620
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:21,210
I'm gonna go crazy.

621
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:23,690
Oh my god.

622
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,050
My game is kinda tweaking, but we should be fine.

623
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,010
I'm heading over.

624
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,050
I said it like twice.

625
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,470
Okay, there we go.

626
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:33,950
Oh, rush order.

627
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:36,490
Uh, I'll make the pumpkin pie.

628
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:38,870
I'll get more fish.

629
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:39,470
More pumpkins.

630
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:46,030
Oh, that's how that works.

631
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,170
Okay, pumpkin pies.

632
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:49,150
Oh, I'm lagging.

633
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:49,410
Hello.

634
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:50,750
We're good.

635
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:51,810
You have the pumpkin pie?

636
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:52,210
I'll do the stew.

637
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:53,210
I'll do the stew and take that.

638
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:53,750
I'll do the stew and take that.

639
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:54,490
You're the director.

640
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:55,570
How are you lagging?

641
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:56,850
I don't know.

642
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:57,650
They hate the Netherlands.

643
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,830
Uh, you just need one pumpkin pie on the third order and you can take it also.

644
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:03,350
I can't open the chest.

645
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:04,910
I'm just waiting to get picked, probably.

646
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,230
I can't open the chest.

647
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:07,330
Oh no.

648
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,110
Pause the game.

649
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:11,330
Pause the...

650
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:12,950
We're fine, we're fine, we're fine.

651
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:14,770
Okay, you got rabbits.

652
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:18,670
Can you just slap random stuff in the top two furnaces?

653
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:22,050
Uh, I don't really have order in my hand yet.

654
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,030
We're winning right now, so we're chilling.

655
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:26,830
Oh shit.

656
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:28,130
This is why you're lagging.

657
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:29,010
You're doing too well.

658
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:32,310
I don't even know the reason why we're winning.

659
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,830
He's actually just hitting the lag switch.

660
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,790
Yeah, yeah, he's hitting the lag switch.

661
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:41,630
Everybody's lagging now.

662
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:42,850
Oh no.

663
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:44,710
Okay.

664
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:48,010
I'll do the rabbit stew, golden carrot one.

665
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:50,550
I'll check for the right order.

666
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:51,990
Do we have potatoes already?

667
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:52,550
Baked potato.

668
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:54,310
Uh, there should be some.

669
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:56,290
Oh wait, I don't have the cooking.

670
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:57,330
Oh, I'll get the sugar cane.

671
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:58,270
I grabbed like the whole snack.

672
00:27:58,370 --> 00:27:59,510
I dropped out it on the floor now.

673
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:01,410
Oh, we're good actually.

674
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:02,430
Dropping off.

675
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,190
Cooked pork chop and chicken.

676
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:08,730
Like, we obviously need more meat.

677
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:10,690
This is delivering to Feinberg.

678
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:11,530
No way, holy moly.

679
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:13,130
Oh my god, nice.

680
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:14,530
This guy's hungry.

681
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:16,270
He's just cooking and ordering at the same time.

682
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:16,850
Wait a minute.

683
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:22,050
You're ordering for yourself for extra points?

684
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:22,910
Damn.

685
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:23,850
We get one.

686
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:25,590
Okay, this order's done too.

687
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,950
I freaking love fish.

688
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:30,790
Getting more mushroom.

689
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:34,490
It's like super close.

690
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,690
Like, everybody's super close.

691
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,310
Mm-hmm.

692
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:42,570
You'll see once the game ends that it's mostly the points that'll be different.

693
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:45,810
Like, the actual orders is pretty close.

694
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,230
But it like scales in points depending on how quick you are.

695
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:49,030
I see.

696
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,870
We need some apples if anyone...

697
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:51,730
I'm going over.

698
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:54,850
Oh, maybe I shouldn't go over because you get...

699
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:57,730
I'm kind of doing apples.

700
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:58,830
Yeah, yeah, I'll do it right for you too.

701
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,590
The potatoes are already in there.

702
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:03,550
Bread, I'll make some bread.

703
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:04,370
You make the bread.

704
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:05,410
I'll go over now.

705
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:06,790
You get the rest so I can...

706
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:07,470
Bread.

707
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,690
So they can have it.

708
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:10,490
Yeah.

709
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:13,990
Apple people coming in.

710
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:15,570
I'm waiting for more fish.

711
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:17,670
Fish time.

712
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:21,050
Man, I love fish.

713
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:22,390
I love the meals.

714
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:24,510
I love fish.

715
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,010
There's an instant order, Wolfie.

716
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:26,490
You can just go.

717
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:28,890
Let's go, Mills.

718
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:30,610
Let's go.

719
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:31,670
Let's go, man.

720
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:32,390
I love fish.

721
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:33,210
Yeah.

722
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:35,630
Oh, yeah, let's go, yeah.

723
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:38,170
If only we got to name our own teams, man.

724
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:39,870
It would be so different.

725
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:42,170
Are we team Mills?

726
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:43,470
Yeah, we're team Mills.

727
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,130
We love fish.

728
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,510
Yeah, that's basically pink team, right?

729
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:46,950
Yeah.

730
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:49,550
Yeah, don't you guys...

731
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:50,330
Do you guys like Mills?

732
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:54,790
Um, Gumi, if you want to come back and start working on some orders, you can if you want to.

733
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:55,890
We have a lot of stuff.

734
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,010
If I was just not listening to the conversation.

735
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,010
Like, you know what?

736
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:00,590
No, I don't want to stay in my game.

737
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,490
I really can't add anything of value.

738
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:04,710
So, I'm just listening.

739
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:05,710
You could give your opinion.

740
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:07,650
You guys are talking about team Mills.

741
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:09,930
Like, I'm just listening and I'm silently agreeing.

742
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:10,130
I don't know.

743
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,850
Do you like them or not?

744
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,470
I'm okay with the name.

745
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:14,770
Oh, I don't know.

746
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,330
We need the sound, we need it.

747
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:17,450
Do you love fishes?

748
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,730
Oh, wait, we have an unoccupied smoker.

749
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,110
Hold on, let's put some shit in there.

750
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:22,870
I got something.

751
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:23,770
Oh, never mind.

752
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:24,750
This guy's already on it.

753
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:27,790
Okay, the right order should be done when there's a fish in there.

754
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:28,470
It needs one.

755
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:29,750
How do I deliver it?

756
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,870
All right, take the next fish.

757
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:33,350
Uh, right click the chest and then there's a...

758
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:33,810
Over here, Gumi?

759
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:35,270
No, no, we'll figure out how to do it.

760
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:35,870
Because we have a light choice.

761
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:36,850
Gumi, just cross up.

762
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:39,610
All right, I got more stuff for you guys.

763
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:41,650
It's much too late.

764
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:42,510
I'm delivering.

765
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,750
It's chill, it's chill.

766
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:44,550
I'm trying to see.

767
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,530
I can't open the furnace.

768
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:46,850
I'll get more fish.

769
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,810
I feel like we need more fish still.

770
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:49,910
Uh-huh.

771
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:51,630
Okay, hold on.

772
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:52,550
We need more everything.

773
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:53,750
This thing's done.

774
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:57,030
All right, is there any specific thing we need most of?

775
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:59,490
I honestly don't know if we need that much stuff anymore.

776
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,230
I think we should focus on making the orders.

777
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:02,870
Because we have overtime for delivering, right?

778
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:05,630
So just try to get them all done.

779
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:08,070
And then we deliver like at the end.

780
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:09,910
Okay, I don't know if I should...

781
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,550
I don't know if I can do that, but okay.

782
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:14,950
Nadia, you're good.

783
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:15,430
You got it.

784
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,030
You're a pro.

785
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:16,730
It's easy.

786
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:18,610
Let me look.

787
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:20,570
Hold on.

788
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:20,990
What?

789
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:22,890
Okay.

790
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:24,390
Right order.

791
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:25,010
Nice.

792
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:25,550
Too bright.

793
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:26,950
Can you look at the rush order?

794
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:27,490
I'm delivering.

795
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:28,970
Yeah, got it, got it, got it.

796
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:30,210
Mushroom stew.

797
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:31,710
I'm gonna do fish.

798
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:34,410
Yup.

799
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:36,330
I got the cookies.

800
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:37,470
Bread in the middle.

801
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:38,630
For three.

802
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:40,270
Okay, mushroom stew done.

803
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:41,850
Okay, I'll take it, I'll take it.

804
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:42,650
Okay, yup.

805
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:44,990
I know my purpose.

806
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,280
Chicken.

807
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:56,160
Okay, chicken for this one.

808
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,580
I think that's good.

809
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,400
Yup, chicken there done.

810
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,480
Okay, chicken's done.

811
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,040
More pumpkin pie?

812
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,320
Is there a mutton?

813
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,600
Okay, mutton's coming.

814
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:06,240
Slow.

815
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,620
Pumpkin pie.

816
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:08,800
Does anyone make it up?

817
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:09,580
Um...

818
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,200
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.

819
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,460
A little bit more stuff real quick.

820
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,220
While everyone's working.

821
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,020
I have no idea what we need.

822
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,700
Doki, fish.

823
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,900
Oh, fish, fish.

824
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,120
I'll go, I'll go.

825
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:20,440
Order's done.

826
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,600
Reverse his legacy, reverse his legacy.

827
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,520
You're right.

828
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,620
He's got cancelled.

829
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,200
We gotta get rid of the fish now.

830
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,900
Our munchie bars aren't even good or whatever they're called.

831
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,140
It's time to burn the trees too.

832
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,060
Wolfie, you can deliver an order on the right.

833
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:34,940
I'm waiting.

834
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,060
I'm trying to complete an order.

835
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,180
Actually, waiting is so smart.

836
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,080
You're actually a genius.

837
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:38,400
Yeah, wait.

838
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,780
I'm gonna sit here and wait for the mutton.

839
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:41,220
We have the mutton.

840
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,380
Okay, wait, wait.

841
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,100
Put it in the chest.

842
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,220
Sorry, I took it.

843
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,560
Okay, that's ready.

844
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,140
We're not gonna get that in time.

845
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,340
Yeah, that mutton's not gonna be done in time.

846
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,260
Yeah, we gotta deliver then we're good.

847
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,480
Anyone delivering for you?

848
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:52,680
Hey, we did good.

849
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,380
We got first.

850
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:54,900
Do we?

851
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:55,800
Yeah.

852
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,960
Yeah, we're delivering too.

853
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:00,760
Where's my customer?

854
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,240
Mine's over here.

855
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,480
Bro is chilling up top.

856
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:07,240
He's got 20 seconds to deliver on, I believe in you.

857
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:07,780
It's fine, I got it.

858
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,500
There's one more chest here.

859
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,680
Oh, nice!

860
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,840
We can't like do it because...

861
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:11,920
Okay, cool.

862
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:12,680
Yeah, we're good, we're good.

863
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:13,060
Okay.

864
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,220
I'm giving the last one in in a second.

865
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,040
Nice.

866
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:18,940
And we're chilling.

867
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,100
Boom.

868
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,460
That game usually goes well.

869
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,540
I think I fixed the point gap too.

870
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,000
Oh my god, nice!

871
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,120
Oh my god, it's so close.

872
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,080
Yeah, the changes made sense.

873
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,260
Nevermind, it's not.

874
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:37,960
Nevermind, it's not.

875
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,960
Just wait till the later rounds, the point gaps get crazy.

876
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:53,100
This one usually was pretty high point gap, but what I did is I just made it so when you do really good, you get less points now, which was the problem before.

877
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:54,960
So now it's balanced.

878
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:59,780
Yeah, the problem is that three teams would do like all evenly pretty good and all the other teams would just had nothing.

879
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:01,440
Correct.

880
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,000
Now it's chill.

881
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,240
Let's go.

882
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,540
Guys, we're going to all be top five.

883
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,460
Again, we can celebrate.

884
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,260
Oh my god.

885
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,120
I get to see myself up there for like at least 10 minutes.

886
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,180
It's going to be so cool.

887
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,180
It's going to be so cool.

888
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,540
Let's see who actually gets the number one.

889
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,120
It could be random.

890
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:20,980
I'm fifth.

891
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,360
Oh, nevermind.

892
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,860
I was fifth in the chat last round.

893
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,360
That's an E.

894
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,700
Huge team moment.

895
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,480
Why did you give me fifth?

896
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,920
Oh, yeah, I am definitely lagging.

897
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,460
It still has my normal skin.

898
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,740
That happened to me last event.

899
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,300
If you change it late, it just happens.

900
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,700
Oh my god, we're going to go for the beef, guys.

901
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,400
You could definitely still be lagging.

902
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:51,180
Like I'm not trying to downplay that, but that's a good server thing.

903
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,500
I'm for sure lagging.

904
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,780
I thought we were the milk lovers.

905
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,420
Okay, we can be both.

906
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,140
We can love fish and beef.

907
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,540
Get it together.

908
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,320
Which is it?

909
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,260
We have to pick one.

910
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,100
I think I only like fish, so...

911
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,340
You're tearing us apart.

912
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:06,280
But like...

913
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,820
That's it, I'm taking a nap.

914
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:13,620
Choices?

915
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,200
But I want it all.

916
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,260
I'm going to relog real quick.

917
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:20,780
Yeah, I am.

918
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,480
Oh, we have like a lens.

919
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,200
It's so funny seeing you with the normal skin up there.

920
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,800
One minute until our next game.

921
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,480
Oh my god, Mr. Incredible, I'm a big fan.

922
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:30,180
Where?

923
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:30,640
Hello?

924
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,840
I love the ones that did FNAF.

925
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:33,460
Oh!

926
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,700
Hey, that's crazy.

927
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,540
Wouldn't it be funny if you just changed the server to like EU for the next game?

928
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,200
That'd be pretty troll, yeah.

929
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,440
That'd be pretty funny.

930
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,080
No, I haven't changed it to Germany or something.

931
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:53,060
Wouldn't that nerf our entire team besides just me?

932
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,600
I'm East Coast at least.

933
00:35:55,940 --> 00:36:01,160
Yeah, but like every other team will also get nerfed, because I assume there's not a lot of Europeans on right now.

934
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,680
No, yeah, there's not that many.

935
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:07,080
It's the risk we should take.

936
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,580
The most is, I think, orange with two, so...

937
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,840
Oh my god, I can read!

938
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,460
Oh my god, she couldn't read.

939
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:15,740
Oh no!

940
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,160
I just said one already?

941
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,060
I have a revival, so what are we going for?

942
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:23,660
What do I do for that?

943
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,820
I think we want to go for like...

944
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,640
I mean the thing is like...

945
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,280
I don't know what everyone wants to vote for the other teams.

946
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:36,940
I think extraction is not a bad idea to do early, because it's like one that usually is pretty tricky.

947
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,200
Oh, I got murdered, never mind.

948
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,580
Don't worry, I got you!

949
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,300
Brought you back!

950
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,940
Welcome back to your own world!

951
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:50,000
Okay, so it turns out that nobody likes fun, and we're playing the exact same game order as last time.

952
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,100
Yeah, yeah.

953
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,540
Because this was the same as last time.

954
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,600
How dare they!

955
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,120
Don't be sheep!

956
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,680
Wait, I think Fun also voted that too.

957
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,120
I think Fun voted for that.

958
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,300
Yeah, this one is Dark and Darker.

959
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,240
Fun, you're a fucking sheep!

960
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:13,620
I almost clicked the lead blockways button.

961
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:14,800
Oh no.

962
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,340
Wait, so how do you play this?

963
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:18,860
Uh, this is like...

964
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,180
Dark and Darker.

965
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,640
Yeah, like Dark and Darker, yeah.

966
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,160
Oh, okay.

967
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,580
So we can kill regular...

968
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,240
Oh, I'm by myself.

969
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,620
There's only like very specific zones you can fight other people.

970
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:37,480
So it's basically just like fighting mobs, punching these like things on the ground, like the pots, and just grabbing everything you can.

971
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,020
And just moving around a lot.

972
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,960
I will run off by myself.

973
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,020
It's a very not a team game, honestly.

974
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:45,680
No, okay.

975
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,420
Okay, so we should just explore by ourselves.

976
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,800
I will run off by myself.

977
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,340
Wolfie should go with...

978
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,280
Like, it is hard.

979
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,980
Like the mobs will kill you and that's really sad.

980
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,020
And then like you can't do anything.

981
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,200
Like your team can rez you, but you need to have someone with you.

982
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,500
So like Wolfie and Doki should probably go together.

983
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,740
And then Gumi and Giga should go together.

984
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,020
And I'll just like not die.

985
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,920
I am a little worried that I might be lagging.

986
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:11,080
So there's a chance a mob just completely combos the hell out of me.

987
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:11,800
And I won't be able to...

988
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,940
Doki, you have to protect him.

989
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,600
Doki is actually my carry.

990
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,220
All right, so it's nice knowing you.

991
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,380
It's really isn't it?

992
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,420
No, I understand.

993
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,560
I'm going to be left behind.

994
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:23,060
It's okay.

995
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,040
No, no.

996
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,720
That means we're both going to die.

997
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:28,700
But I will make sure to use you as bait first to live.

998
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:31,740
Oh, yeah.

999
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,080
Also.

1000
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,580
So there's candles that help lead you to places.

1001
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,160
The purple ones are the most important.

1002
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,940
Because you need to go through a portal to like leave and score points.

1003
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,560
Yeah, you have to do it at the end.

1004
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,700
Otherwise you die.

1005
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:44,800
All your stuff dies with you.

1006
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,280
Oh, so it's dark and dark.

1007
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:46,920
Purple candles are the limit.

1008
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:48,200
Literally.

1009
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,020
Yeah, it's like a 12 minute time limit.

1010
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,340
Wow.

1011
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:52,500
Okay.

1012
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,120
So the candles are...

1013
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,900
If you see one candle, you're a little far from it.

1014
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,980
And then like two and then three, you're getting closer to it.

1015
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:03,140
So you can kind of like use the number of candles in the stack to see what you're close to.

1016
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:03,600
Okay.

1017
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,580
Diane is a merchant to sell stuff.

1018
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,780
And then green is puzzles.

1019
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:08,580
Yep.

1020
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,720
Though I've never found a puzzle in this game.

1021
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:12,460
Oh, yeah.

1022
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,340
Also, you can't sprint.

1023
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:14,420
Fun fact.

1024
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:14,920
Okay.

1025
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:15,480
Yeah.

1026
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:16,780
Good to know.

1027
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,560
I'm gonna go left.

1028
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:22,300
If Giga goes left, I go left.

1029
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,280
Wait, where's Fun?

1030
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,860
Oh, not Fun.

1031
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,200
There's Wolfie.

1032
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:26,340
There's Wolfie.

1033
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:26,800
Okay, there you go.

1034
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:27,480
Like, I'm already split.

1035
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:27,760
Hello.

1036
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,900
Don't worry, I've got you.

1037
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:29,960
Yup.

1038
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,080
I'm good right now.

1039
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,820
There we go, baby.

1040
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:36,800
We can split like a tiny, tiny tad bit.

1041
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,580
We don't have to be like magnets the entire time.

1042
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,500
But we stick next to each other.

1043
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,780
Oh, but there's monsters.

1044
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,320
Yeah, but what if...

1045
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,940
Oh my god.

1046
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:48,500
He has a bow.

1047
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:50,780
He has a bomb?

1048
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,100
Wait, he does so much damage.

1049
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:56,360
You guys probably have figured this out already.

1050
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,640
But if you kill things, it's good.

1051
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:58,860
They can give you better gear.

1052
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:04,240
Like, you can very easily end up with full iron armor, which makes things a lot...

1053
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,340
You make sure you actually put gear on.

1054
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,680
Careful of this guy.

1055
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:09,720
Oh, never mind, I killed him.

1056
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,060
Okay, wait, I'll stick with you, Yuki.

1057
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,880
Oh, there's an arrow guy right there.

1058
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,220
We got him.

1059
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,380
Oh, there's another arrow guy right here.

1060
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,180
I'm beating him.

1061
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:22,780
I'm beating him.

1062
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:23,400
Don't worry, don't worry.

1063
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:24,580
Easy work.

1064
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,120
Oh my god, my hero.

1065
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:25,740
Hold on, hold on.

1066
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:26,800
You take, you take that.

1067
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:27,260
You take that.

1068
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,020
The trust block.

1069
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:33,280
Oh, oh, I hate women.

1070
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,880
Yo, I'm speaking my language.

1071
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,820
Whoa, hold on.

1072
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,620
Well, this arrow guy ain't shit.

1073
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,620
Okay, I got pants for you.

1074
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:46,060
Here, pants.

1075
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:47,680
Oh, that was nice.

1076
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,300
Kill him!

1077
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,780
Oh my god, Kuri died.

1078
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:57,240
Okay, Yuki, this is one where you can fight other players.

1079
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:01,920
This room, the green one, is the one where if you see another player, they can swing you.

1080
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:02,480
Okay.

1081
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,320
Oh, so be careful.

1082
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,580
There's also a mini boss in here.

1083
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,900
I don't know how strong he is, though.

1084
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,140
They can swing you.

1085
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:11,480
Yeah, it's on sight.

1086
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,200
Valorant guys.

1087
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,720
Okay, all right, I don't...

1088
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,300
Leather stuff.

1089
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:22,260
Clay shards.

1090
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,080
Yeah, you should basically hold everything that stacks.

1091
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:30,520
Like, the things you should drop first if your inventory is full is gonna be like your leather armor.

1092
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:32,320
Yep.

1093
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:33,500
There's no team kill, right?

1094
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,180
There's no friendly damage, right?

1095
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,660
Yeah, we can't hit each other now.

1096
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:39,100
Okay.

1097
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,260
Oh, I have potion of regen and potion of healing.

1098
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:41,720
Oh, nice.

1099
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,460
Okay, let me just spleef myself.

1100
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,240
That was awesome.

1101
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,680
You know, I'm trusting you with the map.

1102
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:49,880
All right, all right.

1103
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,960
I was not... I've not been looking at the map.

1104
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,400
This area is looted.

1105
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,940
We can try to see if we can go to the mini boss.

1106
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,040
I don't know if we're able to.

1107
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:59,600
I don't know where mini boss is.

1108
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,300
Like, we are in the chunk.

1109
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,380
I just don't know if we have access to it.

1110
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,080
Like, because we're at the top of the thing.

1111
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:08,800
We might be able to go over here, actually.

1112
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,880
Follow my lead.

1113
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:13,440
Oh, should I increase my Minecraft brightness?

1114
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,200
Probably, if you...

1115
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:15,360
Yeah.

1116
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:15,820
You can, yeah.

1117
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,920
Well, like, you can up to, like, 100%, but past 100%.

1118
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,660
Oh, I found some enemies.

1119
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:22,220
Oh.

1120
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:24,880
Some enemies.

1121
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,980
Do not press the button on the middle thing.

1122
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,860
That is, I think, the mini boss.

1123
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,300
I don't want to die yet, so...

1124
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:31,560
Okay.

1125
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,420
So, I can, but not now.

1126
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:34,700
Not this one.

1127
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:35,640
Oh, wait.

1128
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,520
Oh, there's other players.

1129
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,160
Oh, the bomb.

1130
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,880
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1131
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,380
I'm f****** going up now.

1132
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:43,080
You don't have to go up, you're fine.

1133
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:44,700
They're scared of us, too.

1134
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:45,080
They're scared.

1135
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:45,440
Oh, okay.

1136
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,560
I'm going back down.

1137
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,520
Here, take a stone sword.

1138
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:51,560
A better sword.

1139
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,460
Oh, we can open this.

1140
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,660
Oh, there's a guy over here.

1141
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:56,920
Okay.

1142
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:59,000
Don't worry, we double team.

1143
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:00,100
Big.

1144
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,360
What's that glowing thing up there, Geeko?

1145
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:03,640
Take a helmet.

1146
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:04,580
This is a button.

1147
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:08,760
Secret room.

1148
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:09,740
Got it, nice.

1149
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:10,760
There's someone above you.

1150
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,060
He's got pants.

1151
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:13,320
I see the players.

1152
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,020
Oh, they're actually potting up.

1153
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:18,920
Okay, wait, let's not do that.

1154
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:19,880
Okay, wait, they're potting up?

1155
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,240
If you just leave the room.

1156
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,240
Oh my god, there's somebody.

1157
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,380
No, let's go up, let's go up.

1158
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:25,920
I'm heading up, let's heading up.

1159
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,080
Debated.

1160
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:27,780
We made...

1161
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:28,700
That was on purpose.

1162
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:31,340
We made you waste your shit.

1163
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:32,160
Oh, wait.

1164
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,420
I think they're already coming over.

1165
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,560
No, I don't think so.

1166
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,060
I don't think they activated...

1167
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:38,480
Or maybe they did kill the boss already.

1168
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:38,940
I can't tell.

1169
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:40,740
I don't know if that was worth it at all.

1170
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:43,640
They stanced up.

1171
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:44,340
Oh my god.

1172
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,720
Let's go, I think, over here.

1173
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,400
Oh, somebody died.

1174
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,580
Wait, when you die, it's just game over?

1175
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:54,540
Or do they respawn?

1176
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,580
You can get regenned by your teammates.

1177
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,280
Oh, okay.

1178
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,020
Hold on, I'm missing.

1179
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,120
Oh, I'm lagging, I think.

1180
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,160
Oh, no, you are.

1181
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,040
Yeah, you are.

1182
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,360
Uh-oh.

1183
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,320
You can get it if you can...

1184
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,000
Uh, do we have a good way down?

1185
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:11,540
What?

1186
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:12,920
Oh, there's a way down here.

1187
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:15,340
You can get down this way.

1188
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,040
Okay, be safe.

1189
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:17,420
I hope I'm good.

1190
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:19,560
I mean, Doki's got it covered here, but...

1191
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,300
Yeah, let's go over here.

1192
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:20,780
Let's go over here.

1193
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:22,940
I'm going down to the bar.

1194
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:23,740
Okay, I'm not lagging anymore.

1195
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:24,540
I can hit things now.

1196
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,240
Oh, thank god, yeah.

1197
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:27,120
I saw you move, actually, for real.

1198
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:30,040
Yup, I tried.

1199
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,420
There are so many enemies here.

1200
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:31,760
Oh, no.

1201
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,120
Are we in a mini-boss room right now?

1202
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:33,740
Is that what this is?

1203
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:34,400
Or is this a merchant?

1204
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:35,120
Oh, this is a merchant.

1205
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:35,620
Oh, okay.

1206
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:38,940
The green rooms, like the slightly green ones, are the mini-boss rooms.

1207
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,020
Oh, what is this?

1208
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:41,600
I pressed a button.

1209
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,280
Oh, what did you do?

1210
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:46,100
Hey, go over here.

1211
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:46,600
There's a secret.

1212
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:47,460
Oh, a secret!

1213
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:50,020
There's so many buttons here.

1214
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:51,300
I'm scared.

1215
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:52,380
Let's do this one first.

1216
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,840
Oh, it's like a little mini-maze.

1217
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:56,100
Scary guy.

1218
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:58,520
Is there anything else?

1219
00:44:58,680 --> 00:44:59,300
Yeah, there's a chest.

1220
00:44:59,300 --> 00:44:59,680
Oh, a big guy.

1221
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,460
Wait, is he bad?

1222
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:02,960
Oh, he's bad.

1223
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:04,840
I'm looting.

1224
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:05,540
Oh, that one.

1225
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,160
I hate- Behind you!

1226
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:07,660
What?

1227
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:08,440
There's so many!

1228
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,060
Behind you!

1229
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,860
I'm gonna die, skis!

1230
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,100
Oh, oh, they hate me!

1231
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,480
Oh my god, there's a big boy.

1232
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:18,000
Uh, let's see.

1233
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:18,480
There's another button here.

1234
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:19,740
Yeah, there's more.

1235
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:21,820
Uh, I'm trying to see what loot we have.

1236
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:22,520
Oh, I died!

1237
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:23,720
Wait, you take the boots?

1238
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:26,180
If you come to me, you can come to your grave.

1239
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:26,780
Oh, no, wait.

1240
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:27,360
Do you respawn?

1241
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:28,700
No, you can just resurrect.

1242
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:29,320
Oh, behind, behind.

1243
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,140
Oh, that's right, that's right.

1244
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:31,500
There's a full, like, if you, like, hold it.

1245
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:31,680
I don't know if we, like, shift.

1246
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:33,340
Was it E?

1247
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:35,040
Oh, there we go, I got it, I got it, I got it.

1248
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:35,400
You're good.

1249
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,760
Okay, let's go over here.

1250
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:37,060
There, there, there, there.

1251
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:39,180
I forgot about the rest.

1252
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:39,460
Okay.

1253
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,080
Oh, there's more.

1254
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:41,440
That's fine.

1255
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,120
We're gamers.

1256
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:43,660
We are gamers.

1257
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:45,880
Ooh, okay, wait, you got an iron sword.

1258
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:46,500
That's really good.

1259
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:47,440
Oh, there's people.

1260
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:47,860
I did?

1261
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:49,740
Yeah, I think so.

1262
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:50,760
Oh, I did!

1263
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:52,700
I found a button.

1264
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:54,220
Wait, I have two iron swords, here.

1265
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:55,600
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1266
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,240
Yeah, thank you.

1267
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:58,480
I don't even know when I got the other one.

1268
00:45:58,860 --> 00:45:59,220
I didn't.

1269
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:00,000
Uh, okay.

1270
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:01,620
Uh, watch out.

1271
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,320
This is gonna drop, I think.

1272
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:04,740
It's probably worth it.

1273
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:04,960
Okay.

1274
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:07,180
There we go.

1275
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:09,820
That's cool.

1276
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:12,340
I didn't even know that's a thing.

1277
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:12,960
Well, that's cool.

1278
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,620
Okay, okay, okay.

1279
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,640
Um, this is looted.

1280
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,800
I think we should head over...

1281
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:19,540
Wait, it was looted?

1282
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,320
Someone was here?

1283
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,020
No, no, we looted it.

1284
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:23,320
Oh!

1285
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,380
I was like, who's here?

1286
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,120
And then you got to say it.

1287
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:32,940
Yo, should I try to solo the miniboss, Wolfie?

1288
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:34,220
Give me a yes or no.

1289
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:35,480
Uh, fuck it.

1290
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:36,760
Yes.

1291
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:39,940
Uh, is this looted?

1292
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:41,220
Oh, there's players here.

1293
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:41,820
Okay.

1294
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:43,360
Wait, and we can't kill each other.

1295
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:44,900
Oh, hey, that's- he died there!

1296
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:46,660
He died there!

1297
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,100
You killed the merchant.

1298
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:49,900
He's, like, above us.

1299
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,560
I thought you wanted to find a player.

1300
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,040
Okay, that sure was easy to tell.

1301
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:54,380
Yeah.

1302
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:55,100
Okay.

1303
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:57,820
Isn't it, like, an iron golem or something?

1304
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,500
Yeah, I, like, I smacked it and then I hit them with six hearts.

1305
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:02,340
I backed up, got scared.

1306
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,920
Can I steal their stuff?

1307
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,400
Uh, you can, I think, open their inventory, yeah.

1308
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:10,660
They can't, like- Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can open them.

1309
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:11,700
You should open and steal their stuff.

1310
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,000
Like, genuinely, you should steal their stuff.

1311
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:18,620
Yeah, no, they, no, they, like, dropped stuff and then I, like, went over there to absorb some things.

1312
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:19,000
Where do we go, where do we go?

1313
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:20,060
Follow me, follow me, follow me.

1314
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,040
Oh, there's stuff in here!

1315
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:21,500
Yeah!

1316
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,220
Oh, there's, like, an iron- I'll take that.

1317
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:23,640
Hold on.

1318
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:24,680
Oh my god, I'll take all of these.

1319
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:25,360
Wait, I'll take the iron armor as well.

1320
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:26,600
Whoa, thanks, guys!

1321
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:28,240
While we're at it.

1322
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:28,480
Oh, goodbye.

1323
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:30,080
Oh, that's perfect.

1324
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,600
Thank you, I appreciate it.

1325
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:35,700
Okay, I see a button here.

1326
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:36,060
Yeah.

1327
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:37,220
Oh, a guy.

1328
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:37,900
Okay.

1329
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,300
Okay, we'll go that way, we'll go this way.

1330
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:41,720
That way, that way, that way.

1331
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,120
I'm pretty sure they- have they done this already?

1332
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:46,500
Since they died here?

1333
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,580
No, this is not done yet.

1334
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,260
This is- here's a chest.

1335
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:49,860
Oh!

1336
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:50,700
Yeah, let's go up top.

1337
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:51,280
Oh!

1338
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,560
Is that a floating ladder?

1339
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:52,900
What is this?

1340
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:53,440
Oh, shit, I'm left!

1341
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,000
Okay, um...

1342
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:57,340
I'm scared.

1343
00:47:58,720 --> 00:47:59,500
How long do we have?

1344
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:00,520
Oh, we have three minutes.

1345
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:01,100
Should we...

1346
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,740
I have not found a purple candle yet.

1347
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:04,760
There's memes, there's memes, there's memes!

1348
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:06,860
You can check your map, Giga.

1349
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:11,560
The ones with the purple border are- Oh, they're calling us out for stealing his stuff!

1350
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:13,560
Oh, I see, I see.

1351
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,620
They said they came over and stole his stuff!

1352
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:16,100
Okay, uh, we're going this way.

1353
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:19,780
That's right, that's right, he came around.

1354
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:21,540
But like- Over here, over here.

1355
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:23,360
We didn't mean to, I swear.

1356
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:25,340
Oh, there's more on the floor!

1357
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,600
Wait, hold on, how much is this worth?

1358
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:27,260
Three points?

1359
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:28,240
Picking up our stuff!

1360
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,760
This is worth more points than what I have in my inventory.

1361
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,240
I'm grabbing the potions on the floor.

1362
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:34,580
Wait, how do we...

1363
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:35,820
Okay, wait, yeah, so...

1364
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:36,640
Should we find a portal?

1365
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:38,700
Yeah, we can go down here.

1366
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:41,020
Let's drop.

1367
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:41,760
I'm gonna drop.

1368
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:43,320
Should I drop too?

1369
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:44,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can drop.

1370
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:45,760
Okay.

1371
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,980
Oh, I see another one of us in this chunk at the top.

1372
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:50,740
Yes, me, what's up?

1373
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:51,620
Yeah, there's three of you in there.

1374
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:52,180
Hey, what's up?

1375
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:54,620
I'm gonna throw this and a leather.

1376
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:55,960
Uh, I'm like a little bit low.

1377
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:56,740
Oh.

1378
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,820
You and I are stuck with two people from red team.

1379
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,040
I can't help.

1380
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:06,000
Look at that, there's a good lover over there.

1381
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:09,220
Okay.

1382
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:12,140
Thank you.

1383
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:13,380
I'm here...

1384
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:14,320
Oh, wait, what the fuck?

1385
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:14,780
What's the...

1386
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:15,960
There's red next to us.

1387
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:17,760
Oh, yeah, that's...

1388
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:18,920
So that's decaying.

1389
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:19,360
It's like...

1390
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,060
It's like breaking.

1391
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:21,800
Oh, there's lots of loot.

1392
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,080
All right, let me get that.

1393
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:25,000
Oh, I'll get that.

1394
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:25,880
Don't worry, gay guy.

1395
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:26,860
Grab the chest.

1396
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:31,280
Should we try and find the portal now?

1397
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,300
We have a minute and 40.

1398
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:33,000
Yeah, you should.

1399
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:34,800
You should have a good idea of where one is.

1400
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:37,700
Do you have a good idea where one is?

1401
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,420
I'm on one right now.

1402
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:40,100
We can find one.

1403
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,620
Yeah, just let's go down.

1404
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:44,140
We can go down here.

1405
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:44,960
Oh, maybe not.

1406
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:45,740
No, don't.

1407
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:47,060
Gaps are 10 points.

1408
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:48,300
God, fuck, I'm chugging these.

1409
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,560
Oh, we might find a puzzle here.

1410
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:51,020
Wait, we might, we might.

1411
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:52,400
Leveler?

1412
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:52,700
Lever?

1413
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:54,360
Wait, you said...

1414
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:54,520
Lever?

1415
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:56,400
Okay, wait, let me see.

1416
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:57,000
Here we go.

1417
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,220
Oh, up here, up here, up here.

1418
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,000
I think this should probably be...

1419
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,300
Oh my god, what the fuck, this guy just dropped.

1420
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:02,080
He dropped a ruby.

1421
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:04,000
GG bro, I don't give a damn about that fucking guy.

1422
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:08,240
Yeah, we found a merchant here.

1423
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:08,880
Oh, okay.

1424
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,980
If you go more up, there's one also.

1425
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,040
Okay, we'll find it.

1426
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:13,780
Right here, right here, yeah.

1427
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:14,520
Yo, what's up squad?

1428
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:15,600
Let's go!

1429
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:16,920
Oh my god, are you okay?

1430
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:18,840
We're good.

1431
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:19,180
Me?

1432
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:20,500
Yeah, you.

1433
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:21,700
Oh, that was a shit night.

1434
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:23,340
I get in with it.

1435
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:23,940
I get in with it.

1436
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:24,460
Like, it's all good.

1437
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:26,180
We can go through the portal.

1438
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,380
We have 46 seconds.

1439
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:28,720
I think we're good, yeah.

1440
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:30,220
Um, should I go through, or...?

1441
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:31,880
Uh...

1442
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:32,380
I don't really have much.

1443
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:33,280
Oh my gosh, spider.

1444
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,340
I'm like, my inventory is like, pretty full.

1445
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,240
Yeah, I think we go, probably.

1446
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:37,940
Do I still...

1447
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:38,980
Oh, so I don't have...

1448
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:40,500
So it automatically sells when I go through?

1449
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:41,640
I'm gonna drop coins.

1450
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,260
This is for, like, max points.

1451
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:44,680
Okay, goodbye.

1452
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:45,240
Let's go.

1453
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,900
Pick them up, pick that up, and stack it with your stuff, and then I'll grab these, like...

1454
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:50,360
350 items!

1455
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:50,960
Jesus!

1456
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:52,580
Oh my god!

1457
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:53,680
Okay, let's go in.

1458
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,340
Bro, I had a hundred...

1459
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:56,340
How much did I have?

1460
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:57,300
I think I had like, 50?

1461
00:50:58,360 --> 00:50:59,500
Wait, how much did I have?

1462
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:00,680
You know this when you watch.

1463
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:01,420
Like, I just...

1464
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:02,680
I get it done time and time again.

1465
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,300
The miniboss is so easy to solo.

1466
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:08,080
Yeah.

1467
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:10,680
I mean, it gave me...

1468
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:11,640
I probably had like, 50.

1469
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:12,500
Wait, did we win?

1470
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:14,220
Yeah, we cleared by far.

1471
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:16,300
Oh my god!

1472
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:17,840
Yeah, we cleared by far.

1473
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:18,440
That was crazy.

1474
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:19,820
Oh my god!

1475
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:20,280
Gappington!

1476
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:21,960
All right, let's see this individual scoring.

1477
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:22,340
Come on.

1478
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:25,300
TommyShelby3, do me proud.

1479
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:26,900
I'm curious, I'm curious.

1480
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,380
I'm curious, yeah, yeah.

1481
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:30,400
How much did you get?

1482
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:31,120
I just don't know.

1483
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:32,340
I just don't know how different it is.

1484
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,900
Not bad.

1485
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,420
Oh my god.

1486
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:37,960
Hey, Parker kind of went off though.

1487
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:40,380
For a first time playing, that's huge.

1488
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:41,860
Way to go!

1489
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:43,600
Thank you for that performance.

1490
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:44,360
What an individual!

1491
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:46,360
Look at us!

1492
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,560
It's because you gave me your coins, Giga.

1493
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:49,060
That's all.

1494
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:49,880
I did, I know.

1495
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:51,800
You lifted me up.

1496
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:55,080
And then they called me out in chat.

1497
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:57,080
That was a 600 point experience.

1498
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:58,300
Oh my god.

1499
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:01,140
Let's go!

1500
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:04,920
Yeah, but then like the multiplayer gets like harder, right?

1501
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:06,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1502
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:10,120
Like we could totally still like get absolutely crapped on, but this is a nice start.

1503
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:11,520
It's a nice lead.

1504
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:12,100
We're still up there.

1505
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:13,380
What the heck, guys?

1506
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:14,440
Nice?

1507
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:15,000
Wait!

1508
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:18,640
Look, I'm one point ahead of you, Giga!

1509
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:19,820
Let's go!

1510
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,540
My number's better, though.

1511
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:24,220
You're right, you're right.

1512
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:27,000
If you win the war, I won the battle.

1513
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:32,220
Nice.

1514
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:38,520
All right, I think those are the only fully team split games.

1515
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:39,680
Never punished.

1516
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:42,960
Twerked on somebody's grave and still won.

1517
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:47,320
Feinberg, last time I checked, I didn't ask, so...

1518
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:47,900
Whoa!

1519
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:54,380
Battle Extraction are like the two remaining like team-team games, though.

1520
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:55,080
Yeah, yeah.

1521
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:56,880
And the others are just like a solo game?

1522
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:58,620
Part is individual, race is individual.

1523
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,180
They're all individual?

1524
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:01,900
Spleef's individual.

1525
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:08,660
Well, you can work with your teammates, but it's like not like a team-based game where like we're all winning together or losing together.

1526
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,300
Oh, I see, I see.

1527
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:13,300
Yeah, it's just like you get individually eliminated.

1528
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,680
So if any of us make it further, we get three more points.

1529
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:17,920
Wait, but Spleef is Splatoon.

1530
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:19,220
Is that a team game?

1531
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,460
The Splatoon one, party.

1532
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,760
Yeah, that part of party is team split.

1533
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:28,540
You're actually, yes.

1534
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:29,560
Yeah, yeah.

1535
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:30,640
I don't know.

1536
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:32,680
The heist one might be as well.

1537
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:33,860
Heist is not.

1538
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:35,420
Like, heist is individual.

1539
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:38,820
You're just like dumping your points into the team box, right?

1540
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:43,140
That's funny you say that, because I made the game and I don't know.

1541
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:44,880
Yeah, I was gonna say, did you make...

1542
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,460
Aren't you like the lead organizer?

1543
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,800
And you're asking the players questions?

1544
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:51,200
Like...

1545
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,780
I'm just like, no, I just genuinely don't pay attention.

1546
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,280
Interesting, interesting.

1547
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:07,380
What kits do you guys usually take for battle?

1548
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,520
We can talk about it when we get in there.

1549
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:11,920
Are we doing beta?

1550
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,200
Like an archer kind of kit.

1551
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,200
We can, we can.

1552
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:14,840
I don't know.

1553
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,520
I just don't really care about what we play when.

1554
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:18,320
Yeah, I'm down.

1555
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:19,420
I'm down to stand on battle.

1556
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:20,460
Yeah, sure.

1557
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:21,680
You can see how good it is.

1558
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:22,280
Oh, dang it.

1559
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:23,800
Oh, golf rules, okay.

1560
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:24,640
Golf rules, golf rules.

1561
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:25,920
Leave, leave, leave, leave.

1562
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:26,640
I'm gonna leave.

1563
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:27,480
Stand on party.

1564
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:28,460
I wanna play party last.

1565
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:30,520
Okay, that's blue, okay.

1566
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,500
Oh god, okay, okay.

1567
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:32,840
I don't know what's happening.

1568
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:33,840
We got Warcrabs and Lagundo.

1569
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:35,620
Okay, the WCat duo.

1570
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:37,580
No, I put my cat on battle.

1571
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:39,520
I think we're gonna be playing Spleef?

1572
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:40,920
We're playing Spleef, okay.

1573
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:41,480
We're playing Spleef?

1574
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:42,020
My cat!

1575
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:42,900
You're just...

1576
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:43,920
Nobody is in Spleef.

1577
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:44,700
Yeah, we're playing Spleef.

1578
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:47,080
Yeah, I was like, there's nobody in Spleef though.

1579
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:47,760
Are we doing party?

1580
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:49,760
I think we are.

1581
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:50,740
Because it's golf rules.

1582
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:53,960
So it's the one with the least is the one that gets picked.

1583
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:55,820
Oh, the one with the least, oh.

1584
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,020
Oh my god.

1585
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:59,500
So many lingo.

1586
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:02,040
There we go.

1587
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:02,920
What the heck?

1588
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:03,260
Alright, let's get it.

1589
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:03,580
Golf?

1590
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:04,800
What is this?

1591
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:05,980
Okay, Spleef.

1592
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,920
So you break blocks below people's feet.

1593
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:10,340
Oh, it's Fall Guys!

1594
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:12,200
Yeah, kinda.

1595
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:16,220
Except you can break blocks under people and send them down.

1596
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:17,640
Alright, guys.

1597
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,920
I cannot wait to spectate all of this.

1598
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:22,140
Sophie, I had a nightmare.

1599
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:25,140
Yeah, you were gonna go crazy, I believe.

1600
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:26,960
As a positive part of your...

1601
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,840
Also, I got the most nervous for Spleef out of any game.

1602
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:31,760
I got the most nervous for Spleef out of any game.

1603
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:35,280
I'm traumatized by Joe Bart specifically...

1604
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,380
...because he always walks up to me, looks me in the eyes...

1605
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:38,700
...and then digs under me and I die.

1606
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:40,300
It just happens like every time.

1607
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:41,780
Why don't you just walk away?

1608
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:43,880
Just go backwards.

1609
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:44,940
Just walk away.

1610
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:45,720
Have you ever heard of Jetski?

1611
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:46,160
Walk away.

1612
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:49,060
Right.

1613
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:50,780
I'll do that next time.

1614
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:53,880
You're so right.

1615
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,780
This is also a social game.

1616
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:59,800
So if someone's like mildly threatening...

1617
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,660
...just press your crouch key and you're fine.

1618
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:02,300
Okay.

1619
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,980
Just press shift and then they might be friendly.

1620
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,920
I think they would like run at you more.

1621
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:08,420
Yes!

1622
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:10,360
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1623
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:11,970
That's, that's, that's...

1624
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:13,740
It's not nice, so they won't do it.

1625
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:16,440
Don't do it.

1626
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:20,320
Oh, I'm already a layer down.

1627
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:20,870
This is awesome.

1628
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:22,640
Me too.

1629
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:24,420
That might have been my fault.

1630
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:25,460
I'm so sorry.

1631
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:27,360
Oh my god, the lag though.

1632
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:38,940
Can I dig up?

1633
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,680
Look above and you can start like...

1634
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:44,360
Oh my god, that's fucking right!

1635
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:46,040
That's fucking right.

1636
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:47,260
I'm gonna dig up now.

1637
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:50,740
No!

1638
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:52,320
I dug up.

1639
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,080
I'm gonna still dig up though.

1640
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:56,940
I can't.

1641
00:56:57,060 --> 00:56:57,400
No!

1642
00:56:57,740 --> 00:56:58,260
I'm dead.

1643
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:01,040
I need to stop digging up.

1644
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:01,860
I need to stop.

1645
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,540
This guy's emoting.

1646
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:06,740
What is going on?

1647
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:07,500
Hello?

1648
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:09,860
It's just the guy breaking it down in his sleep.

1649
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:11,780
Guys, I dug up.

1650
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:12,940
I fucked up.

1651
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:17,020
I dug up and I was not looking.

1652
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:21,440
I'm just gonna make a wide stripe in the second to last one.

1653
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,220
Let's not dig down for either.

1654
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:24,700
No, I know.

1655
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,980
I'm gonna, I'm gonna go social game right now.

1656
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:29,980
I'm gonna go crouch at everybody.

1657
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:31,620
Oh god.

1658
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:32,880
Oh, he's coming over.

1659
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:33,920
You're such a...

1660
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:34,840
You're so mean!

1661
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,440
Oh, that's not a friend.

1662
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:39,960
Why is Kuroithon and Snowball at me?

1663
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:41,020
He has one arm.

1664
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:42,160
Like, dude, does he understand?

1665
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:44,980
Yeah, he's just, he's just committed, man.

1666
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:47,980
Wait, they can, they're throwing snowballs at me.

1667
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:48,960
He's so mean.

1668
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:49,800
No!

1669
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:50,720
There's a red button too!

1670
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:51,640
Stop fighting me!

1671
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:52,120
I know.

1672
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:54,240
Parker, Parker, Parker, Parker is not nice.

1673
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:55,540
He is mean.

1674
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:56,000
Stop!

1675
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:57,700
Hold on.

1676
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:58,160
Hello, you.

1677
00:57:58,260 --> 00:57:59,360
I'm gonna stay with you.

1678
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:00,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1679
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:02,020
I'm getting...

1680
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,680
I made so many friends here.

1681
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:04,580
I'm getting terrorized by people.

1682
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:05,560
Oh my god, Kuro got last.

1683
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:06,620
Oh my god.

1684
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:08,060
Just throw up.

1685
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,140
Throw upward.

1686
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:10,460
Oh no.

1687
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,060
I'm making it my mission to go up with you now.

1688
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:14,740
I can't believe the four split leaf allegations.

1689
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:17,600
They're chaining at me!

1690
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:18,940
I know, I know, I know!

1691
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:19,740
Dude.

1692
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,960
Oh, tragic.

1693
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:24,220
I'm getting cyberbullied!

1694
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:25,200
Somebody help!

1695
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:26,980
I'm gonna kill this VTuber!

1696
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:30,900
Wow, first Twitch and now this?

1697
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:34,980
Oh no, it's...

1698
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:36,600
Now I know why you didn't turn around.

1699
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:38,040
Oh, I killed somebody.

1700
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:38,640
Let's go.

1701
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:42,860
I'm just trying to be a nice guy and it doesn't matter at all in my life.

1702
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:44,180
Of course not, B!

1703
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:44,620
No!

1704
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:47,820
I got top layer on lock.

1705
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,080
No comp.

1706
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:51,320
Okay, me and Forsyth are friends.

1707
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:51,640
This is good.

1708
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:53,760
How do I freaking spectate?

1709
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:54,540
Oh my god.

1710
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:56,720
I'm just flat.

1711
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:57,840
I'm just falling down.

1712
00:58:58,540 --> 00:58:58,940
Unlucky.

1713
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:01,220
Hold on.

1714
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,680
I'm holding it down for the pink team.

1715
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:04,860
Wait, how do I...

1716
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:06,360
Oh, I really got hit off.

1717
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:07,440
I'm looking.

1718
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:09,600
Hey guys.

1719
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:10,580
I hope you're not believing my clutch.

1720
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,020
Oh my god.

1721
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:13,520
I see Gooby, hold on.

1722
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:14,280
WT.

1723
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:15,520
You guys are going crazy, let's go.

1724
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:17,280
You see, this is where the top layer should be.

1725
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:20,320
How did you guys become friends?

1726
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:20,960
Wait, where are my...

1727
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,840
Oh, my snowballs.

1728
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:27,040
My snowballs just disappeared randomly.

1729
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:27,800
Oh no.

1730
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:29,340
Who do we have left?

1731
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:30,560
Unlucky, man.

1732
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:31,940
I got nobody.

1733
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:34,060
I got 37th.

1734
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:35,360
I just got full targeted.

1735
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:35,920
It was crazy.

1736
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:41,420
I'm like, I'm trying to consistently be a nice person and I just got full actual targeted.

1737
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:45,080
Okay, this one, you get a bow and it explodes.

1738
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:46,000
Oh, okay.

1739
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:46,740
You can rocket jump.

1740
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:49,200
And you can rocket jump with the bow.

1741
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:50,760
She doesn't know what that means.

1742
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:52,420
No, I know what rocket jump means.

1743
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:53,720
That's from Team Rocket too.

1744
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:57,420
The crossbow, you're gonna get a crossbow that like auto recharges.

1745
00:59:57,620 --> 00:59:58,720
The crossbow auto recharges.

1746
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:02,200
You can like jump and then shoot and then you go high.

1747
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:03,120
Oh my god.

1748
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:07,940
Yeah, it's kind of wicked.

1749
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:09,400
Oh, I'm sorry.

1750
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:10,020
I'm sorry.

1751
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:11,320
I didn't mean it.

1752
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:11,640
I didn't mean to.

1753
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:12,260
I'm gonna go for Luffy.

1754
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:13,080
Come back here.

1755
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:14,880
Oh, that's Toms.

1756
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:15,480
I'm so sorry.

1757
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:22,820
Oh, I can like rocket jump here.

1758
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,040
Oh, I see.

1759
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:28,380
I see the rocket jump mechanic.

1760
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:29,960
No, my god.

1761
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:32,160
I just...

1762
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,180
Oh my god.

1763
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:34,780
I got all the way down.

1764
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:36,560
I got to the last layer accidentally.

1765
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:38,640
Oh, Jimmy.

1766
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:39,560
Oh no.

1767
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:45,320
I was testing out the rocket jump and I fell through.

1768
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:50,100
Oh my god.

1769
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:54,280
I fell through because I was testing out the rocket jump.

1770
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:58,260
That make up box just combo'd me off the edge.

1771
01:00:58,520 --> 01:00:59,680
She's crazy of it.

1772
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,900
Yeah, Blue doesn't like us for some reason.

1773
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:04,460
Yeah, what the...

1774
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:05,300
What did you do?

1775
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:06,880
What did we do to Blue?

1776
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:12,060
Hooster is the number one VTuber hater in the world.

1777
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:12,720
Oh my god.

1778
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:13,060
Oh yeah.

1779
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:13,820
Certified.

1780
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:15,680
He has a diploma for it.

1781
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:17,780
Here we go for that guy.

1782
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:19,640
Oh my god.

1783
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:21,800
Oh my god.

1784
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:25,200
You can fall so far on those and it just doesn't matter.

1785
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,700
I don't think I like this game mode.

1786
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:28,400
I don't think...

1787
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:29,380
I'm gonna get the switch.

1788
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:30,360
Blue loves to...

1789
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:32,300
Oh my god, I got knocked so far down.

1790
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,460
I don't think I like this game mode, guys.

1791
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:37,900
Hold on.

1792
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:39,320
I got pushed.

1793
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,240
If I did...

1794
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:43,320
I should not have played around with rocket jump.

1795
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:44,380
That was my...

1796
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:45,560
That was my downfall.

1797
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:46,740
Your hubris.

1798
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:51,260
I literally was rocket jump and I fell all the way to the last layer.

1799
01:01:54,020 --> 01:01:54,640
I've done that.

1800
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,840
That was a mistake.

1801
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:00,680
Oh.

1802
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:03,400
Camman18, noob.

1803
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:04,860
Get Camman.

1804
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:05,720
Get him.

1805
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,800
No, oh my...

1806
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:08,020
That's crazy.

1807
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:09,800
That's crazy.

1808
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:10,460
I just play dropper.

1809
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:11,140
That's crazy.

1810
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:12,220
Oh my god.

1811
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:13,640
You actually threw the needle.

1812
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:16,740
Oh my god, there's four T's.

1813
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:18,040
That's still full party.

1814
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:20,160
That's crazy.

1815
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:24,500
Is it the more points you get for people being alive, right?

1816
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:25,000
Yes.

1817
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:25,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1818
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:27,120
Okay, sorry.

1819
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:31,140
All right, hold up.

1820
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:31,980
Time break master class.

1821
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:35,740
You've only got the entire lobby on you.

1822
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:36,600
They want you.

1823
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:37,480
Yeah, they want you.

1824
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:37,820
They know.

1825
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:38,680
Oh, goodbye.

1826
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:42,320
Oh my god.

1827
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:43,020
The opposition.

1828
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:44,700
The...

1829
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:46,240
Oh my god, they're so good.

1830
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:47,080
They're kind of worse, honestly.

1831
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:49,280
Oh, blueberries.

1832
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:50,620
Blueberries guy.

1833
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:52,580
All good.

1834
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:52,980
Get him.

1835
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:53,800
Yeah, this is a...

1836
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,060
This is a classic...

1837
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:55,660
Fuck Meteor.

1838
01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:56,500
...not explain from me.

1839
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:57,200
No, it's okay.

1840
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:58,240
It's all right.

1841
01:02:59,020 --> 01:02:59,040
Oh.

1842
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:00,580
They want pause for...

1843
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:01,740
Pause for Jojo.

1844
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:04,300
Yeah, somebody probably...

1845
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:05,900
The gamer sounds a pretty good job, so...

1846
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:07,240
Yeah, yeah.

1847
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:07,900
Yeah, no, we can...

1848
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:08,940
This gamer is just...

1849
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:10,440
This gamer is just bad, it seems.

1850
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:11,900
Okay.

1851
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:16,800
Now, I kind of love this game, but even if I die all the time...

1852
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:18,960
It's fine.

1853
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:19,500
It's...

1854
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,080
You're gonna love this round.

1855
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:22,540
You're gonna really like it.

1856
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:22,740
This round is crazy.

1857
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:25,860
So, this one is like Roblox natural disasters.

1858
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:28,220
There's meteors that fall out of the sky and they blow up.

1859
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,040
And you can pick up the meteor and throw it at people.

1860
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:33,320
Wait, you can pick up the meteor and throw...

1861
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:33,860
Oh, okay.

1862
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:34,640
Yeah, yeah.

1863
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:37,340
It'll like fall and then there's like a meteor chunk.

1864
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:39,460
And if you throw it at someone, it's like a snowball.

1865
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:41,540
But it deals like five times more knockback.

1866
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:42,220
Oh, yeah.

1867
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:42,880
Yeah.

1868
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:43,280
Okay.

1869
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:46,160
So, yeah.

1870
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:46,920
It's just goofy.

1871
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:48,440
Okay, I believe.

1872
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:49,340
I believe in us.

1873
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:50,280
Hell, yeah.

1874
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:51,460
I believe in Feinberg.

1875
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:54,060
I have personal beef with you two now.

1876
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:55,080
Okay.

1877
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:55,920
Don't hit me up.

1878
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:56,900
We can go for blue.

1879
01:03:57,020 --> 01:03:57,600
I'm okay with that.

1880
01:03:58,180 --> 01:03:59,000
That sounds like a good target.

1881
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:00,400
I just...

1882
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:01,500
I just want to live.

1883
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:02,620
I just...

1884
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:03,880
I just want to live.

1885
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:09,460
I want to be on the last layer one time.

1886
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:12,300
I just want to be alive.

1887
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:13,360
That's all I want.

1888
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:17,380
All right, here we go.

1889
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:19,200
I forgot the edges are thick.

1890
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:20,940
The ice is all single layer.

1891
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:23,000
Okay, so we can just stay at...

1892
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:25,000
Just...

1893
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:27,120
We just stay on the snow, right?

1894
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:28,780
Uh, yeah.

1895
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:30,380
But there's probably gonna be a lot of people there.

1896
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:32,820
Yeah, it's like technically safer.

1897
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:37,120
It'll probably be like pretty well contested.

1898
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:38,540
So you might want to be careful.

1899
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:40,500
Where's my friend?

1900
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:43,620
Oh my god, people are so evil.

1901
01:04:45,860 --> 01:04:46,600
I owe someone.

1902
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:47,260
Okay, wait.

1903
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:48,840
I must locate the blue team.

1904
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:50,620
Where are they at?

1905
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:54,160
Me and someone from blue just like teamed up and dug some guy out.

1906
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:56,140
Oh my god, that's fucked.

1907
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:58,580
That's actually fucked, bro.

1908
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:02,180
Wait, what's the red?

1909
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:02,740
Is that the...

1910
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:03,300
Is that the meteor?

1911
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:04,440
Oh, that's the meteor stuff.

1912
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:05,120
That's the meteor, yeah.

1913
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:05,560
That's a warning.

1914
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:06,180
It's a warning.

1915
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:08,080
It'll come down from the sky.

1916
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:09,500
Oh!

1917
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:10,580
Ouch!

1918
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:11,880
Yeah.

1919
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:14,500
It's a meteor.

1920
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:15,860
No, someone punched me off.

1921
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:18,280
Hold on.

1922
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:21,260
Oh, there's another meteor.

1923
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:22,140
There's a meteor down below.

1924
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:27,420
Where the blue team at?

1925
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:28,760
I see one blue guy.

1926
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:29,760
Oh, I see more blue guys.

1927
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:31,100
You bastard!

1928
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:32,000
You get back here!

1929
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:32,820
I hate you!

1930
01:05:33,140 --> 01:05:35,460
I don't know who you are, but I hate you!

1931
01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:44,920
Sorry, someone just got like targeted in front of me.

1932
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:46,680
And then I turn around and I get crouched down.

1933
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:47,480
I was so confused.

1934
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:48,920
It's like, oh, okay.

1935
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:50,800
Guys, don't be...

1936
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:51,540
Guys, peace.

1937
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:52,620
World peace, guys.

1938
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:53,380
World peace.

1939
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:55,460
Oh, oh, I just did Fumble Nation.

1940
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:58,040
World peace, everybody.

1941
01:05:58,380 --> 01:05:59,160
World peace.

1942
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:00,340
What?

1943
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:02,720
Oh my god.

1944
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:08,100
Oh no, I just walked behind somebody who was walking over the ice.

1945
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:10,000
And I broke the blocks in front of them.

1946
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:11,700
Oh, that's so mean.

1947
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:13,340
That's fucked.

1948
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:14,320
Feels bad.

1949
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:14,840
They're on blue.

1950
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:15,200
It's fine.

1951
01:06:15,260 --> 01:06:15,640
They're on blue.

1952
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:15,960
It's fine.

1953
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:17,460
It's all right.

1954
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:17,860
It's all right.

1955
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:19,100
That's what matters.

1956
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:22,540
I don't have much to live for anyways.

1957
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:27,120
So sad.

1958
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:31,900
I'm not being aggressive.

1959
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:36,160
If I don't aggress people, people will be nice to you.

1960
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:38,920
Please be nice to me.

1961
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:41,160
She just rocket jumped down a layer.

1962
01:06:44,820 --> 01:06:46,780
There's so many meteor chunks over here.

1963
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:47,120
Hold on.

1964
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:47,460
Catch.

1965
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:49,440
Oh god, I want another one.

1966
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:50,680
Oh no.

1967
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:51,740
Catch.

1968
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:54,860
Hey, where's that mecha blue person or whatever?

1969
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:56,320
I need better ass.

1970
01:06:56,420 --> 01:06:57,000
Get her ass.

1971
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:58,540
I need a tequila.

1972
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:00,040
Oh.

1973
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:02,920
I see Prince Zam.

1974
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:03,920
Okay.

1975
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:05,380
Prince Zam?

1976
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:07,940
Prince Zam, yeah.

1977
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:09,120
He's the op.

1978
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:10,680
There's so many meteors.

1979
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:11,880
He's the op, okay.

1980
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:14,860
He's one of them at least.

1981
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:15,420
He's on blue.

1982
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:18,640
Wait, so what does having a meteor do?

1983
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:22,720
Oh, you get to throw it at somebody.

1984
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:23,640
It's strong.

1985
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:26,080
I won't do that to you.

1986
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:28,740
You should always keep, you should always keep moving.

1987
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:30,940
Careful, the meteors are fast now.

1988
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:31,700
Oh my god.

1989
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:32,160
Yep.

1990
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:34,100
Okay, let's see.

1991
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:40,140
Oh, I died.

1992
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:41,640
Okay, that was actually totally my bad.

1993
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:43,520
I'm holding it.

1994
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:44,200
I'm holding it out.

1995
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:45,860
That's right.

1996
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:56,640
I'm so sorry.

1997
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:05,540
Oh, I like moved in a bad spot.

1998
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:07,120
That was all skilled, terrible.

1999
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,220
A meteor is actually really fun.

2000
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:10,200
Yeah, okay.

2001
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:12,700
That was all my fault.

2002
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:18,700
Like, I was like at the very top and then you were like, the meteors go faster.

2003
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:21,320
And I brought all the way down to the bottom.

2004
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:23,260
They full target where you are.

2005
01:08:23,260 --> 01:08:27,420
So you just have to find like a running path that like doesn't overlap yourself ever.

2006
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:33,520
Freak out first twice.

2007
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:34,540
Not last, not last.

2008
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:34,880
Let's go.

2009
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:36,940
That shit was so brutal.

2010
01:08:40,730 --> 01:08:42,950
Some Mari Party-ass music right now.

2011
01:08:43,690 --> 01:08:44,810
Oh, the score breakdown.

2012
01:08:45,290 --> 01:08:46,470
Oh, thank god not last.

2013
01:08:46,470 --> 01:08:48,250
The difference points actually isn't that bad though.

2014
01:08:48,250 --> 01:08:48,830
Oh my god.

2015
01:08:50,350 --> 01:08:51,810
We should have beeped that person.

2016
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:53,510
Blue team.

2017
01:08:54,310 --> 01:08:55,550
Yeah, blue went crazy.

2018
01:08:56,310 --> 01:08:58,250
They're going to be good in extraction, I think.

2019
01:08:58,350 --> 01:08:59,070
Oh, Galahad.

2020
01:08:59,110 --> 01:08:59,430
Yeah.

2021
01:09:00,050 --> 01:09:00,630
Who's there?

2022
01:09:01,090 --> 01:09:02,030
Oh, Galahad.

2023
01:09:02,270 --> 01:09:03,690
Still first, doesn't matter.

2024
01:09:04,370 --> 01:09:05,530
We're still first, let's go.

2025
01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:10,010
Gekko.

2026
01:09:11,990 --> 01:09:15,030
Joel's got, Joel's back on his hater guard, crazy.

2027
01:09:16,650 --> 01:09:17,110
Oh,

2028
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:20,950
nevermind.

2029
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:23,490
Oh, I felt my hater fingers moving.

2030
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:26,010
I was about to type deserved.

2031
01:09:28,510 --> 01:09:29,270
Let's go, Wolfy.

2032
01:09:29,610 --> 01:09:30,330
Where did we go?

2033
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:34,010
Oh shit, I'm still number two, even after that absolutely brutal game.

2034
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:36,650
I got kicked out of the rankings.

2035
01:09:38,970 --> 01:09:41,970
I got kicked out of rankings because of Spleef.

2036
01:09:43,230 --> 01:09:44,230
Bro, that shit is brutal.

2037
01:09:44,230 --> 01:09:44,870
Oh, I got a 20.

2038
01:09:45,310 --> 01:09:46,670
We'll climb back, we'll climb back.

2039
01:09:49,810 --> 01:09:50,610
I'm 15th.

2040
01:09:51,450 --> 01:09:51,850
Oh my god.

2041
01:09:51,870 --> 01:09:53,270
Oh, that's like 16th in Spleef.

2042
01:09:53,270 --> 01:09:55,530
That's what I bring to the team.

2043
01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:56,770
I got 20th.

2044
01:09:56,850 --> 01:09:59,290
It's like, I'm mid, that's my goal.

2045
01:09:59,770 --> 01:10:02,570
No, I just like, I got four targeted by blue team round one.

2046
01:10:02,790 --> 01:10:06,590
If I just like, I need to drop, I need to drop the nice guy faster in Spleef.

2047
01:10:06,750 --> 01:10:09,110
Like, I'll start with a nice guy, but I need to drop it faster.

2048
01:10:09,270 --> 01:10:10,250
I'm still complacent.

2049
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:12,730
I'm like, I'm not going to change someone's way of thinking, you know?

2050
01:10:12,790 --> 01:10:15,430
Like, they were throwing the first snowball, they were throwing the 10th, you know what I mean?

2051
01:10:15,430 --> 01:10:19,010
Like, I had to change that switch in my head and throw the snowballs back.

2052
01:10:19,190 --> 01:10:20,510
And then it was just...

2053
01:10:20,510 --> 01:10:23,770
No, it's not in my heart to do that.

2054
01:10:23,910 --> 01:10:24,890
It's not in my heart to do that.

2055
01:10:25,110 --> 01:10:26,250
I think I hate people.

2056
01:10:26,830 --> 01:10:27,130
Oh.

2057
01:10:30,050 --> 01:10:32,250
This is what Spleef causes.

2058
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:38,550
I was about to talk smack to Curry for being in 38th, but he's playing with one arm, so never mind.

2059
01:10:39,510 --> 01:10:40,910
Wait, why is he playing with one arm?

2060
01:10:40,990 --> 01:10:41,610
Is it like a nerf?

2061
01:10:41,650 --> 01:10:42,870
His other one doesn't work anymore.

2062
01:10:43,470 --> 01:10:45,670
Oh, he broke his elbow at TwitchCon.

2063
01:10:46,950 --> 01:10:47,750
Oh, damn.

2064
01:10:48,850 --> 01:10:49,630
What did he do?

2065
01:10:49,630 --> 01:10:52,150
That's like, I don't even care if you broke your elbow.

2066
01:10:53,730 --> 01:10:55,570
Uh, the one where they said that.

2067
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:56,270
I don't remember.

2068
01:10:59,110 --> 01:11:03,850
Where the guy turns around, he's like, look, I don't care that you broke your elbow.

2069
01:11:05,170 --> 01:11:06,130
It's Minecraft.

2070
01:11:06,590 --> 01:11:07,790
It's real life.

2071
01:11:11,710 --> 01:11:12,810
What is that?

2072
01:11:12,910 --> 01:11:14,190
Oh, I thought they were buttholes.

2073
01:11:14,690 --> 01:11:14,890
What?

2074
01:11:16,210 --> 01:11:18,030
What are you looking at?

2075
01:11:18,510 --> 01:11:19,290
The chat.

2076
01:11:20,670 --> 01:11:23,690
Okay, now we go for a PvP game, surely, right?

2077
01:11:23,690 --> 01:11:25,470
No, look, it kind of looks like a butthole.

2078
01:11:27,070 --> 01:11:27,430
Oh.

2079
01:11:29,030 --> 01:11:30,510
Oh, I got a cat.

2080
01:11:32,270 --> 01:11:33,910
Why do you want to put a cat, Stokie?

2081
01:11:34,170 --> 01:11:36,290
Battle, red, red, red, red, battle.

2082
01:11:36,930 --> 01:11:37,350
Okay.

2083
01:11:40,490 --> 01:11:41,330
Cat down.

2084
01:11:41,710 --> 01:11:42,330
Is that my cat?

2085
01:11:43,610 --> 01:11:45,510
Jimmy is keeping my cat hostage.

2086
01:11:45,970 --> 01:11:47,190
Wait, my cat's gone.

2087
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:48,330
I got a catnip.

2088
01:11:48,330 --> 01:11:50,190
Oh, no, I'm getting mad.

2089
01:11:50,330 --> 01:11:51,650
I think I need to beat someone.

2090
01:11:52,450 --> 01:11:53,110
My cat.

2091
01:11:53,330 --> 01:11:53,690
Do it.

2092
01:11:53,990 --> 01:11:54,770
Let it out.

2093
01:11:56,410 --> 01:11:56,810
Goodbye.

2094
01:11:57,630 --> 01:11:59,190
Okay, I think we actually get that one.

2095
01:11:59,290 --> 01:11:59,850
Not allowed in the rest of the event.

2096
01:12:00,170 --> 01:12:02,010
Oh, my god, how did I die?

2097
01:12:04,090 --> 01:12:07,710
Oh, battle not on track, like, shocker.

2098
01:12:08,150 --> 01:12:11,130
This is an elite second half coming up, hold on.

2099
01:12:11,590 --> 01:12:12,350
I'm liking this.

2100
01:12:12,770 --> 01:12:13,170
Shocker.

2101
01:12:15,790 --> 01:12:17,570
Who is still, who is still punching me?

2102
01:12:18,490 --> 01:12:21,190
I cannot even exist right now.

2103
01:12:21,410 --> 01:12:23,230
I can't even exist.

2104
01:12:24,670 --> 01:12:28,790
Okay, so this one is kit pvp battle royale.

2105
01:12:28,910 --> 01:12:29,550
Oh, okay.

2106
01:12:30,690 --> 01:12:31,730
I know that.

2107
01:12:32,590 --> 01:12:36,470
Yeah, so we pick a kit that's like rolls.

2108
01:12:36,570 --> 01:12:39,110
It's kind of like Overwatch-ish in terms of kits.

2109
01:12:40,170 --> 01:12:43,590
I think fine will probably go damage.

2110
01:12:44,010 --> 01:12:45,070
I could go damage.

2111
01:12:45,190 --> 01:12:46,570
Gumi, you said you want to do range, right?

2112
01:12:46,830 --> 01:12:47,550
I can do support.

2113
01:12:48,350 --> 01:12:48,710
Yeah.

2114
01:12:49,690 --> 01:12:50,930
So, Gumi, you can go skeleton.

2115
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:52,510
That's like the bow kit.

2116
01:12:52,970 --> 01:12:53,310
I think that would be good.

2117
01:12:53,310 --> 01:12:54,810
I'm looking at the summoner.

2118
01:12:54,810 --> 01:12:56,010
You like doing, do I get blocks?

2119
01:12:56,930 --> 01:12:58,490
Do you like doing two support or one?

2120
01:12:59,030 --> 01:12:59,710
Yeah, we should have two.

2121
01:13:00,010 --> 01:13:00,490
Two, yeah.

2122
01:13:00,970 --> 01:13:02,990
You guys get points for healing, too.

2123
01:13:03,030 --> 01:13:03,570
It's kind of awesome.

2124
01:13:04,010 --> 01:13:04,210
Yeah.

2125
01:13:04,770 --> 01:13:06,750
What do we, what should we pick for support?

2126
01:13:06,850 --> 01:13:07,690
There's like three characters.

2127
01:13:08,770 --> 01:13:11,550
Uh, I'd say fairy and medic are the easiest.

2128
01:13:11,550 --> 01:13:13,910
One of them's like, yeah, I think those two are the best one.

2129
01:13:14,190 --> 01:13:15,430
One of them's like god tier.

2130
01:13:15,450 --> 01:13:17,010
Fairy and medic at some point.

2131
01:13:17,430 --> 01:13:19,650
If fairy is crazy, I can play because I've played it before.

2132
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:21,950
That's the one that's like, uh, if you just stand on me, you regen.

2133
01:13:22,310 --> 01:13:24,350
And then I can just buff that regen every now and then.

2134
01:13:24,990 --> 01:13:27,410
So we just pack up in one spot as best we can.

2135
01:13:27,730 --> 01:13:28,770
And medic is pretty simple.

2136
01:13:28,850 --> 01:13:30,690
You just throw a potion on people.

2137
01:13:31,110 --> 01:13:32,510
What does summoner do?

2138
01:13:32,890 --> 01:13:34,050
It summons like...

2139
01:13:34,050 --> 01:13:34,850
You can click it and see.

2140
01:13:34,950 --> 01:13:35,370
You're not locked.

2141
01:13:35,410 --> 01:13:36,590
You're not locked in when you click it.

2142
01:13:39,830 --> 01:13:40,810
What's medic healing?

2143
01:13:42,530 --> 01:13:43,830
You get, you get like...

2144
01:13:43,830 --> 01:13:45,410
Medic's just like a default kind of healing kit.

2145
01:13:45,410 --> 01:13:50,570
Fairy is like, has sort of an ability that we have to like, stay next to the fairy to get better healing.

2146
01:13:50,790 --> 01:13:51,450
Alright, are you playing scout?

2147
01:13:52,150 --> 01:13:53,110
Yeah, yeah, I'm playing scout.

2148
01:13:53,470 --> 01:13:54,950
Okay, I don't know what I want to play.

2149
01:13:56,370 --> 01:13:58,710
Um, I might go like trickster.

2150
01:13:58,850 --> 01:13:59,590
That'd be kind of silly.

2151
01:14:00,150 --> 01:14:01,270
What is on this kit?

2152
01:14:01,390 --> 01:14:01,910
I don't even know.

2153
01:14:02,570 --> 01:14:04,750
I don't know what they changed for the kits this time.

2154
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:07,550
Uh, I don't think anything got changed from what I remember.

2155
01:14:08,030 --> 01:14:08,570
I don't think so, yeah.

2156
01:14:09,190 --> 01:14:11,170
But as long as, uh, one of you guys is fairy, one of you guys is medic.

2157
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:14,430
And then both me and Goomy, you guys can kind of pick whatever.

2158
01:14:14,430 --> 01:14:15,090
Yeah.

2159
01:14:15,210 --> 01:14:19,790
And I will just make call-outs as to where we're going.

2160
01:14:20,130 --> 01:14:23,390
And if we all go together and we all die, it's my fault.

2161
01:14:23,590 --> 01:14:25,890
So just don't, just listen.

2162
01:14:26,130 --> 01:14:31,950
If we all listen to the wrong comm, it's better than like half of us being split.

2163
01:14:32,170 --> 01:14:34,810
And if we end up dying, it's my fault.

2164
01:14:35,090 --> 01:14:37,810
Okay, what if I assimilate?

2165
01:14:39,230 --> 01:14:40,070
What's happening here?

2166
01:14:40,370 --> 01:14:40,790
Come here.

2167
01:14:40,950 --> 01:14:41,770
Into another team?

2168
01:14:41,990 --> 01:14:43,750
It's probably still my fault.

2169
01:14:45,010 --> 01:14:45,650
Okay, noted.

2170
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:49,650
Everyone jump on the dock.

2171
01:14:51,790 --> 01:14:52,150
Wait, oh.

2172
01:14:52,490 --> 01:14:53,430
Fuck, I forgot about the dock.

2173
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:54,410
No, this is so important.

2174
01:14:54,890 --> 01:14:55,150
Come on.

2175
01:14:55,310 --> 01:14:56,570
Wait, is it good luck?

2176
01:14:56,870 --> 01:14:57,310
You have to.

2177
01:14:57,450 --> 01:14:57,810
I'll do it next round.

2178
01:14:57,910 --> 01:14:59,570
No, I did before though.

2179
01:14:59,610 --> 01:15:00,050
I did before.

2180
01:15:00,050 --> 01:15:00,930
That was so close.

2181
01:15:02,590 --> 01:15:04,010
Okay, uh, we have a medic, right?

2182
01:15:04,050 --> 01:15:06,570
So we can do the splash absorption at the start.

2183
01:15:06,910 --> 01:15:07,310
Yeah, sure.

2184
01:15:07,630 --> 01:15:08,170
Splash absorption.

2185
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:09,510
Should I do it now or just wait for the start?

2186
01:15:09,510 --> 01:15:11,230
Let's just, let's play it, um...

2187
01:15:11,230 --> 01:15:11,790
Or wait, yeah.

2188
01:15:11,890 --> 01:15:12,510
Fine, you can just call.

2189
01:15:12,570 --> 01:15:13,110
Yeah, fine, fine.

2190
01:15:13,130 --> 01:15:14,090
Do it now, do it now, do it now.

2191
01:15:14,090 --> 01:15:15,790
Do the absorption.

2192
01:15:16,310 --> 01:15:17,190
Did I do it?

2193
01:15:18,850 --> 01:15:19,210
Um...

2194
01:15:19,210 --> 01:15:20,350
You have to throw it at the feet.

2195
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:23,210
There we go.

2196
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:24,810
All right, here, stay up, stay up, stay up.

2197
01:15:24,810 --> 01:15:25,690
We're gonna mullet off them.

2198
01:15:25,870 --> 01:15:26,590
There are some gaps.

2199
01:15:26,590 --> 01:15:27,690
Two teams here, stay up, stay up.

2200
01:15:27,730 --> 01:15:28,830
Hi, ground doki.

2201
01:15:29,010 --> 01:15:30,130
Hi, let's go.

2202
01:15:30,230 --> 01:15:32,230
We can clean up, we can clean up this fight.

2203
01:15:32,310 --> 01:15:33,590
Just use range, use range.

2204
01:15:36,370 --> 01:15:38,930
It said next to me if you are low, get on me.

2205
01:15:39,010 --> 01:15:39,230
I'll try to get you.

2206
01:15:39,230 --> 01:15:41,390
Don't worry, I've got the kill right here.

2207
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:42,570
I'll be blasting them.

2208
01:15:42,570 --> 01:15:43,890
I got a kill.

2209
01:15:44,310 --> 01:15:44,710
Okay.

2210
01:15:45,470 --> 01:15:48,590
Look at this blue and orange fight.

2211
01:15:48,650 --> 01:15:49,730
Just try to spam them with arrows.

2212
01:15:51,050 --> 01:15:53,210
Don't worry, I exist to heal.

2213
01:15:56,310 --> 01:15:57,350
Someone's hurting me.

2214
01:15:58,650 --> 01:16:00,250
Oh, I have splash harming, hold on.

2215
01:16:00,590 --> 01:16:00,890
Yeah.

2216
01:16:02,690 --> 01:16:04,410
I'm going around the slider to spam them.

2217
01:16:04,930 --> 01:16:05,610
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

2218
01:16:06,470 --> 01:16:06,890
I'll stay with.

2219
01:16:09,270 --> 01:16:09,670
Big.

2220
01:16:11,270 --> 01:16:12,270
Oh, that did big damage.

2221
01:16:12,270 --> 01:16:13,650
Hold on, cleanup crew.

2222
01:16:14,310 --> 01:16:14,790
Yeah, run, run.

2223
01:16:14,830 --> 01:16:15,690
Okay, okay.

2224
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:16,570
Cam's low.

2225
01:16:18,410 --> 01:16:20,210
A blue behind is chasing.

2226
01:16:20,850 --> 01:16:21,570
No, they're no longer chasing.

2227
01:16:22,030 --> 01:16:22,350
Nice.

2228
01:16:23,310 --> 01:16:24,530
Everyone stay, just stay, stay, stay.

2229
01:16:24,610 --> 01:16:25,090
Come, come, come.

2230
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:28,370
Try to get up this ladder if you can.

2231
01:16:29,250 --> 01:16:29,490
Yep.

2232
01:16:31,730 --> 01:16:32,830
Up the ladder I go.

2233
01:16:32,830 --> 01:16:34,850
Oh my god, up the ladder I go for real.

2234
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:36,750
We don't have like people in range.

2235
01:16:36,850 --> 01:16:39,170
We didn't get a capture point, but I think we made up for it.

2236
01:16:39,330 --> 01:16:41,410
I'm sorry, let's just run at this orange person over here.

2237
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:43,930
Okay, watch the void, watch the void, watch the void.

2238
01:16:43,950 --> 01:16:44,770
Be careful, be careful, yeah.

2239
01:16:45,250 --> 01:16:46,310
Watch the void, watch the void.

2240
01:16:46,410 --> 01:16:47,090
Yeah, don't fall, don't fall.

2241
01:16:47,290 --> 01:16:48,030
Watch the jumps here.

2242
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:50,030
There's just a couple scary jumps.

2243
01:16:50,930 --> 01:16:52,150
I'm just trying to run at this orange person.

2244
01:16:53,290 --> 01:16:55,890
They just keep, uh, I think their team is telling them that they...

2245
01:16:55,890 --> 01:16:56,950
Oh my god, parkour civilization.

2246
01:16:57,110 --> 01:16:57,710
Someone hit me, I'm in the void.

2247
01:16:58,210 --> 01:16:58,770
Oh no!

2248
01:16:59,210 --> 01:16:59,490
No!

2249
01:16:59,610 --> 01:16:59,870
No, you're here!

2250
01:17:00,090 --> 01:17:00,370
Midair.

2251
01:17:01,130 --> 01:17:01,510
Yeah, midair.

2252
01:17:01,510 --> 01:17:02,170
I'm still here, I'm still here.

2253
01:17:02,170 --> 01:17:02,430
That's okay.

2254
01:17:02,670 --> 01:17:03,590
Yeah, we'll just stay up here.

2255
01:17:03,810 --> 01:17:05,390
Try to get up a ladder if you can, yeah.

2256
01:17:05,430 --> 01:17:06,430
Try to get up a ladder if you can.

2257
01:17:06,910 --> 01:17:09,450
Every jump you make counts, parkour civilization.

2258
01:17:09,450 --> 01:17:10,930
Are you gonna jump for the beef?

2259
01:17:11,150 --> 01:17:12,870
There's one solo blue.

2260
01:17:13,310 --> 01:17:14,890
I'm jumping for the beef!

2261
01:17:17,310 --> 01:17:18,390
I can spectate, I'll watch.

2262
01:17:19,270 --> 01:17:21,270
Get the harm, get the harm!

2263
01:17:22,530 --> 01:17:25,170
Uh, border shrink is soon-ish.

2264
01:17:25,190 --> 01:17:26,530
Yeah, we're up here, we're up here, we're chilling, we're chilling.

2265
01:17:28,670 --> 01:17:32,530
So yellow has two, light blue has two, green has two.

2266
01:17:32,590 --> 01:17:33,610
How many people are alive on orange?

2267
01:17:33,690 --> 01:17:34,530
Still one or zero?

2268
01:17:34,790 --> 01:17:35,850
One, one, one.

2269
01:17:35,950 --> 01:17:36,470
Thank you, thank you.

2270
01:17:36,530 --> 01:17:38,510
And then there's two full teams, red and blue.

2271
01:17:38,510 --> 01:17:39,630
Yeah, red is full.

2272
01:17:40,050 --> 01:17:41,110
Okay, okay, very wonderful.

2273
01:17:41,210 --> 01:17:44,510
Yeah, there's Kuriwa on the right, he's like solo, just chilling on the tower.

2274
01:17:44,630 --> 01:17:47,750
I'm jumping, orange is- orange on the slider, on the slider, on the slider!

2275
01:17:48,310 --> 01:17:49,690
Yeah, hold on, yeah, yeah, get him, get him, get him.

2276
01:17:51,530 --> 01:17:51,830
Unlucky.

2277
01:17:53,070 --> 01:17:56,070
No, we can take some space here, come down, come down, come down anyways.

2278
01:17:56,470 --> 01:17:57,090
I'm down here!

2279
01:17:58,730 --> 01:18:00,610
We want to try to fight the people that are solo.

2280
01:18:01,210 --> 01:18:01,770
That is true.

2281
01:18:02,610 --> 01:18:02,890
Yeah.

2282
01:18:03,270 --> 01:18:05,730
Oh my god, this soundtrack is so intense.

2283
01:18:05,730 --> 01:18:08,390
Actually, up the slider is not fine, because the two other teams are gonna shoot us.

2284
01:18:08,490 --> 01:18:10,750
Come back, come back, come back, come back, come back, come back, we're good, we're good, we're good.

2285
01:18:10,810 --> 01:18:11,810
Blue's going after us slowly.

2286
01:18:11,850 --> 01:18:13,230
Make sure you guys are healed up.

2287
01:18:15,050 --> 01:18:15,550
Fuck it.

2288
01:18:16,290 --> 01:18:17,490
All right, come in Wolfie, come in Wolfie.

2289
01:18:17,530 --> 01:18:19,330
Okay, you can see I'm up above our head.

2290
01:18:19,330 --> 01:18:20,850
All right, everyone come in, everyone come in, watch this.

2291
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:22,850
We're gonna go down in this ice and we're just gonna start fighting people.

2292
01:18:23,210 --> 01:18:25,110
Come down this ice and just go around the ring of death, do it.

2293
01:18:26,050 --> 01:18:27,050
The ice of death!

2294
01:18:29,130 --> 01:18:30,330
Just don't touch anything.

2295
01:18:31,670 --> 01:18:32,230
Just go!

2296
01:18:32,990 --> 01:18:35,650
Some Looney Tunes-ass gameplay right here.

2297
01:18:37,850 --> 01:18:39,130
I'm trying, but I'm scared!

2298
01:18:39,130 --> 01:18:40,930
This guy can't sprint jump because he has one arm.

2299
01:18:41,470 --> 01:18:41,990
Taking advantage.

2300
01:18:44,170 --> 01:18:44,650
Oh god.

2301
01:18:44,830 --> 01:18:46,250
That was a goofy, goofy little play there.

2302
01:18:47,130 --> 01:18:47,570
Thank you.

2303
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:49,590
Okay, careful of the border.

2304
01:18:50,930 --> 01:18:53,430
You guys just have to zoom down there with you, three.

2305
01:18:54,890 --> 01:18:55,350
There's 16.

2306
01:18:55,350 --> 01:18:56,070
All right, more people dropping.

2307
01:18:56,910 --> 01:18:59,070
Hold on, I'll find one on you right now.

2308
01:18:59,530 --> 01:19:00,370
I don't have heals yet.

2309
01:19:00,370 --> 01:19:01,470
Can you heal me, heal me, heal me, can you splash it down?

2310
01:19:01,630 --> 01:19:02,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2311
01:19:02,590 --> 01:19:03,870
I splashed one down.

2312
01:19:04,350 --> 01:19:05,410
Oh, it's over time.

2313
01:19:05,450 --> 01:19:06,750
I might be dead though, I might be dead.

2314
01:19:06,750 --> 01:19:08,870
Go center, go center.

2315
01:19:09,190 --> 01:19:10,670
They all come up to me.

2316
01:19:10,730 --> 01:19:11,570
Oh god, that was purple.

2317
01:19:11,810 --> 01:19:12,250
I couldn't tell.

2318
01:19:12,450 --> 01:19:13,530
I hate women!

2319
01:19:14,090 --> 01:19:14,890
Okay, hold on.

2320
01:19:14,910 --> 01:19:15,450
Yeah, that actually was purple.

2321
01:19:15,610 --> 01:19:16,190
That actually was purple.

2322
01:19:16,410 --> 01:19:16,830
I couldn't tell.

2323
01:19:17,110 --> 01:19:18,090
I'm not even gonna ask you.

2324
01:19:18,190 --> 01:19:20,870
I couldn't tell because that color looked like our color.

2325
01:19:21,350 --> 01:19:22,450
That was so similar.

2326
01:19:22,750 --> 01:19:24,570
Yeah, I was like, team!

2327
01:19:24,950 --> 01:19:26,570
And then I got hit.

2328
01:19:26,950 --> 01:19:27,770
That was good though.

2329
01:19:27,770 --> 01:19:29,230
That was honestly really good.

2330
01:19:29,470 --> 01:19:30,950
Our dance there was good, yeah.

2331
01:19:31,130 --> 01:19:31,430
I liked it.

2332
01:19:31,430 --> 01:19:33,370
That was three percent of the damage.

2333
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:36,970
I was so sad, they shot me midair.

2334
01:19:37,190 --> 01:19:38,590
Hold on, I had eight.

2335
01:19:39,150 --> 01:19:39,570
That's crazy.

2336
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:42,510
I was just blasting the firework.

2337
01:19:42,510 --> 01:19:44,090
No, the firework crest was funny.

2338
01:19:44,230 --> 01:19:46,690
How much healing did you guys do percentage-wise?

2339
01:19:46,790 --> 01:19:47,650
I've just never seen it before.

2340
01:19:48,150 --> 01:19:49,970
Does it say in the chat?

2341
01:19:50,970 --> 01:19:52,550
Like percentage of total healing?

2342
01:19:52,850 --> 01:19:54,910
I've never, this is a new mechanic, so I'm just curious.

2343
01:19:56,410 --> 01:19:58,290
If it doesn't, that's okay.

2344
01:19:58,830 --> 01:20:00,590
It says I did, oh, I did.

2345
01:20:00,610 --> 01:20:01,870
I did 7.8.

2346
01:20:02,030 --> 01:20:04,310
I did, is that good?

2347
01:20:04,310 --> 01:20:05,550
I only got 0.3.

2348
01:20:05,670 --> 01:20:06,810
Probably, yeah, probably.

2349
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:08,690
That's okay.

2350
01:20:09,010 --> 01:20:10,150
I don't know if that's good.

2351
01:20:10,210 --> 01:20:11,170
I got plus, plus 20.

2352
01:20:11,170 --> 01:20:12,270
I don't know if it's good either.

2353
01:20:12,490 --> 01:20:15,590
Yeah, I got plus 23 points for it.

2354
01:20:17,710 --> 01:20:18,710
I'm on the dock.

2355
01:20:19,190 --> 01:20:19,550
Why?

2356
01:20:19,990 --> 01:20:21,290
I'm jumping, I'm jumping.

2357
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:24,210
If you could change your weight, would ya?

2358
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:25,470
Who's turn is it?

2359
01:20:25,590 --> 01:20:27,450
So, we have Awk on our right.

2360
01:20:27,450 --> 01:20:28,970
We're gonna go right, we're gonna go right, we're gonna go right.

2361
01:20:29,110 --> 01:20:30,650
We're gonna do the absorption at the very start, we're gonna go right.

2362
01:20:30,670 --> 01:20:31,590
Okay, splash absorption, okay.

2363
01:20:31,730 --> 01:20:34,410
We're going, okay, Ducky, throw it on the floor.

2364
01:20:34,610 --> 01:20:36,370
I do it, I'm doing it, I'm doing it.

2365
01:20:37,190 --> 01:20:37,670
Let's go.

2366
01:20:38,550 --> 01:20:39,470
And now we're going right.

2367
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:42,610
Yeah, we wanna contest, I think, for capture point.

2368
01:20:42,770 --> 01:20:43,570
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

2369
01:20:43,770 --> 01:20:45,090
We wanna contest this fight.

2370
01:20:45,210 --> 01:20:46,270
Try to stay up if you can.

2371
01:20:46,650 --> 01:20:48,290
Like, get up on this ladder, Wolfie.

2372
01:20:48,450 --> 01:20:50,650
I'm dropping down here, and I'm blasting him.

2373
01:20:51,710 --> 01:20:53,230
Okay, I'm going up on the ladder.

2374
01:20:53,330 --> 01:20:54,550
I'm going up the ladder too.

2375
01:20:57,210 --> 01:20:58,130
Stay with you.

2376
01:20:58,770 --> 01:20:59,650
Okay, moxwomb down.

2377
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:02,370
Oh, you fucking...

2378
01:21:02,850 --> 01:21:04,250
Let's pick off this one, the small orange.

2379
01:21:04,910 --> 01:21:06,070
I just... that's my bad.

2380
01:21:06,870 --> 01:21:07,790
I didn't... I wasn't thinking.

2381
01:21:08,190 --> 01:21:09,230
Your center, your center.

2382
01:21:09,550 --> 01:21:10,150
Can you guys all come?

2383
01:21:11,770 --> 01:21:13,950
Ducky and I are holding height, though.

2384
01:21:14,050 --> 01:21:14,650
Is that okay?

2385
01:21:15,230 --> 01:21:17,310
We're gonna come back up, we're gonna come back up, we're gonna come back up.

2386
01:21:18,370 --> 01:21:19,390
I'm staying up here.

2387
01:21:19,530 --> 01:21:20,430
Oh, wait, we're still capturing.

2388
01:21:21,790 --> 01:21:22,450
It's chilled out.

2389
01:21:22,650 --> 01:21:23,590
It captures when you...

2390
01:21:23,590 --> 01:21:26,330
All right, let's just get up, let's just get up.

2391
01:21:27,010 --> 01:21:28,270
I don't know where another ladder is.

2392
01:21:29,410 --> 01:21:29,970
Yeah, yeah.

2393
01:21:30,090 --> 01:21:31,810
Oh my god, I got lost.

2394
01:21:31,830 --> 01:21:34,010
Yellow is coming, yellow is coming behind us.

2395
01:21:34,250 --> 01:21:34,610
Careful.

2396
01:21:35,030 --> 01:21:36,050
They're not gonna actually fight.

2397
01:21:37,950 --> 01:21:40,150
Purple's chilling, green and red are fighting over to the right.

2398
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:40,910
We can try to clean up.

2399
01:21:40,910 --> 01:21:42,550
There's an orange to my right.

2400
01:21:43,850 --> 01:21:44,950
I'm watching left, I'm watching yellow.

2401
01:21:45,490 --> 01:21:47,230
I am existing, I'm existing.

2402
01:21:47,490 --> 01:21:48,570
There's yellow to our left.

2403
01:21:49,730 --> 01:21:52,430
I wanna try to jump green maybe if this gets ugly.

2404
01:21:52,430 --> 01:21:53,170
I don't know.

2405
01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:55,850
I'm getting...

2406
01:21:56,260 --> 01:21:57,030
Maybe if it gets ugly.

2407
01:21:58,890 --> 01:22:00,410
One yellow's heading toward us.

2408
01:22:00,530 --> 01:22:02,310
I'm gonna try to go behind orange here.

2409
01:22:02,890 --> 01:22:03,730
I'm gonna try to go behind orange.

2410
01:22:04,010 --> 01:22:05,690
Okay, okay, okay.

2411
01:22:07,550 --> 01:22:08,650
They're looking at us.

2412
01:22:08,750 --> 01:22:08,790
Where is that?

2413
01:22:09,330 --> 01:22:10,890
Oh, we are not here.

2414
01:22:12,370 --> 01:22:14,310
I was looking the wrong way.

2415
01:22:14,870 --> 01:22:15,690
Can we go over to you?

2416
01:22:16,670 --> 01:22:17,250
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2417
01:22:17,250 --> 01:22:17,810
Wolfie back up.

2418
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:21,270
Oh, this guy's committed.

2419
01:22:21,630 --> 01:22:22,070
He's mad.

2420
01:22:22,310 --> 01:22:24,290
Okay, I need healing.

2421
01:22:24,630 --> 01:22:26,510
He ran away from me.

2422
01:22:27,950 --> 01:22:28,550
Camp's on me.

2423
01:22:29,990 --> 01:22:30,990
Don't worry, I got you.

2424
01:22:31,890 --> 01:22:33,410
He's gonna back up and they're all gonna back up.

2425
01:22:33,790 --> 01:22:34,230
Pop to regen.

2426
01:22:36,150 --> 01:22:36,870
Now what?

2427
01:22:37,090 --> 01:22:39,150
Yeah, pop a healing pot on all of us together if we group up here.

2428
01:22:39,590 --> 01:22:42,190
I'll give you a harming too just in case they push up.

2429
01:22:42,650 --> 01:22:42,950
Okay.

2430
01:22:42,950 --> 01:22:43,070
Okay.

2431
01:22:43,330 --> 01:22:47,490
I have my healing pot regening right now.

2432
01:22:49,670 --> 01:22:50,510
Hey, watch the void.

2433
01:22:50,610 --> 01:22:51,050
Watch the void.

2434
01:22:51,790 --> 01:22:52,190
Careful.

2435
01:22:54,110 --> 01:22:55,990
I didn't want to get shot off like you.

2436
01:22:56,190 --> 01:22:56,870
Back up, watch the void.

2437
01:22:56,970 --> 01:22:59,070
Just don't get shot.

2438
01:23:01,270 --> 01:23:02,250
Yeah, jump over here.

2439
01:23:02,670 --> 01:23:03,450
Jump over here.

2440
01:23:03,470 --> 01:23:06,590
I'm like, I don't want to be like Keegan like last game.

2441
01:23:07,910 --> 01:23:08,310
Exactly.

2442
01:23:09,650 --> 01:23:10,390
Okay, hold on.

2443
01:23:11,190 --> 01:23:13,130
Purple over here, we can like...

2444
01:23:13,130 --> 01:23:13,530
Purple is poking?

2445
01:23:14,030 --> 01:23:15,490
No, no, we should just chill, we should just chill.

2446
01:23:15,570 --> 01:23:17,170
You should save your rocket things.

2447
01:23:17,870 --> 01:23:18,950
I have one...

2448
01:23:19,950 --> 01:23:24,710
Okay, one red, one blue, one aqua, one lime.

2449
01:23:24,770 --> 01:23:25,370
Who's on eighth?

2450
01:23:25,630 --> 01:23:26,930
Is there a person alive on orange or no?

2451
01:23:27,550 --> 01:23:28,150
There's three.

2452
01:23:29,930 --> 01:23:31,310
Let's jump all across.

2453
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:32,830
And then just chill here.

2454
01:23:33,370 --> 01:23:33,890
Oh my god.

2455
01:23:35,830 --> 01:23:37,970
I'm so chill, I feel so chill.

2456
01:23:39,030 --> 01:23:39,670
I'm watching.

2457
01:23:40,030 --> 01:23:41,690
I'm just flashing blue a little bit.

2458
01:23:42,830 --> 01:23:44,650
I'm going to shoot yellow over there.

2459
01:23:45,390 --> 01:23:46,510
I'm looking at your HP.

2460
01:23:47,870 --> 01:23:48,570
I'm standing on you.

2461
01:23:48,570 --> 01:23:48,790
I'm standing on you.

2462
01:23:49,790 --> 01:23:51,630
I'm existing, I'm Lucio-ing.

2463
01:23:52,670 --> 01:23:54,930
I'm moving, I'm moving, I'm making a tiny circle.

2464
01:23:55,910 --> 01:23:56,410
I'm moving, I'm moving, I'm making a tiny circle.

2465
01:23:56,410 --> 01:23:56,490
I'm healing.

2466
01:23:57,810 --> 01:23:59,450
Oh no, we can just stand over here.

2467
01:23:59,570 --> 01:24:00,910
These mobs are annoying as shit.

2468
01:24:01,050 --> 01:24:03,470
I need to be on healing, yo.

2469
01:24:03,630 --> 01:24:07,010
I have an instant heal, just in case.

2470
01:24:07,470 --> 01:24:09,230
Alright, let's all go down into the ice.

2471
01:24:09,310 --> 01:24:09,430
Ready?

2472
01:24:09,610 --> 01:24:10,770
3, 2, 1, go, go, jump down.

2473
01:24:11,010 --> 01:24:11,670
Go, go, go, go, go.

2474
01:24:12,710 --> 01:24:13,330
Jumping down?

2475
01:24:14,610 --> 01:24:15,210
I'm ouchie.

2476
01:24:15,430 --> 01:24:20,730
Oh god.

2477
01:24:21,150 --> 01:24:23,310
My kit's so not great on close range.

2478
01:24:23,310 --> 01:24:24,050
Okay, okay, okay.

2479
01:24:25,630 --> 01:24:27,330
Oh my god, what is...

2480
01:24:27,330 --> 01:24:28,910
Oh, it's overtime, it's overtime.

2481
01:24:29,410 --> 01:24:30,710
What is going on?

2482
01:24:30,830 --> 01:24:33,230
I'm so low, I'm so low.

2483
01:24:33,450 --> 01:24:34,310
I couldn't do it.

2484
01:24:34,310 --> 01:24:36,430
You got this, you got this, you're doing good.

2485
01:24:36,750 --> 01:24:38,030
Let's go, let's go squad, let's go squad.

2486
01:24:38,030 --> 01:24:39,070
Stay, stay middle, yep.

2487
01:24:39,850 --> 01:24:40,370
Nice!

2488
01:24:42,970 --> 01:24:43,810
Let's go!

2489
01:24:45,450 --> 01:24:45,970
Alright.

2490
01:24:46,550 --> 01:24:48,310
I did 10.88.

2491
01:24:49,150 --> 01:24:49,690
Be sad, be sad.

2492
01:24:50,070 --> 01:24:51,130
We're in first again.

2493
01:24:53,930 --> 01:24:55,970
12.29% Epic.

2494
01:24:56,810 --> 01:24:59,070
You can pick whatever, honestly.

2495
01:24:59,110 --> 01:24:59,450
Whatever.

2496
01:24:59,450 --> 01:24:59,910
Whatever.

2497
01:25:01,370 --> 01:25:02,170
Flex slots.

2498
01:25:02,510 --> 01:25:06,670
My mental game plan doesn't have a good fifth kit.

2499
01:25:06,770 --> 01:25:08,770
That I know is better than the rest of them.

2500
01:25:08,870 --> 01:25:10,730
So you can pick whatever you're most comfortable with.

2501
01:25:10,730 --> 01:25:12,130
Back on the leaderboards we go.

2502
01:25:12,450 --> 01:25:12,990
Let's go.

2503
01:25:14,150 --> 01:25:17,430
It matters in the sense that whatever you think you'll do the best with.

2504
01:25:17,510 --> 01:25:20,090
Not in the sense that this kit is so good you should pick it every time.

2505
01:25:20,430 --> 01:25:20,730
That's all.

2506
01:25:22,190 --> 01:25:24,590
Wait, how many rounds of this?

2507
01:25:25,410 --> 01:25:25,950
Oh, one more.

2508
01:25:26,970 --> 01:25:28,550
Oh, I see it, round 303.

2509
01:25:30,110 --> 01:25:30,990
Got him.

2510
01:25:32,830 --> 01:25:35,630
Rofi, it's actually criminal I got 27 that one time.

2511
01:25:36,150 --> 01:25:37,170
I'm putting it on my mind.

2512
01:25:37,170 --> 01:25:38,770
This round I have 14.

2513
01:25:39,290 --> 01:25:41,230
I have to double that to beat that.

2514
01:25:41,530 --> 01:25:43,070
It's actually insane what happened.

2515
01:25:43,130 --> 01:25:43,430
A what?

2516
01:25:43,490 --> 01:25:44,570
27 kills in one?

2517
01:25:44,570 --> 01:25:45,110
Yeah, yeah.

2518
01:25:45,790 --> 01:25:48,090
I activated the sleeper agents in my team.

2519
01:25:49,570 --> 01:25:51,510
I feel like I should have asked ahead of time.

2520
01:25:51,630 --> 01:25:54,110
Do my summoning mobs hurt us?

2521
01:25:54,770 --> 01:25:56,010
No, just other people.

2522
01:25:56,250 --> 01:25:57,510
They distract other people.

2523
01:25:57,510 --> 01:25:58,570
Oh, I see.

2524
01:25:59,890 --> 01:26:00,850
They're pretty good.

2525
01:26:00,950 --> 01:26:03,350
What we had literally last round.

2526
01:26:03,550 --> 01:26:05,890
When you're in a corner, those mobs can...

2527
01:26:05,890 --> 01:26:07,430
Yeah, I was down to 5 hearts for nothing.

2528
01:26:07,630 --> 01:26:08,230
Same, yeah.

2529
01:26:08,710 --> 01:26:10,210
I was just kind of chilling there.

2530
01:26:11,690 --> 01:26:12,170
Yay!

2531
01:26:13,750 --> 01:26:14,230
Yay!

2532
01:26:14,530 --> 01:26:15,070
Let's go!

2533
01:26:15,650 --> 01:26:20,170
I have the instant health potion so I'll just keep that in the last fight if we need it.

2534
01:26:20,990 --> 01:26:21,470
Bubblegut.

2535
01:26:22,390 --> 01:26:23,730
That damage combo is crazy.

2536
01:26:23,910 --> 01:26:24,870
What happens...

2537
01:26:24,870 --> 01:26:27,970
You know the end circle where everyone starts mosh pitting?

2538
01:26:28,230 --> 01:26:28,690
Yeah, yeah.

2539
01:26:28,690 --> 01:26:31,410
Your kit gets taken away there so you gotta use all your stuff.

2540
01:26:31,750 --> 01:26:33,390
Oh, so there's no heals or anything.

2541
01:26:33,530 --> 01:26:34,290
It's just fight.

2542
01:26:34,850 --> 01:26:35,250
Oh, I see.

2543
01:26:35,250 --> 01:26:36,870
It's just everyone's on the equal playing ground.

2544
01:26:37,490 --> 01:26:39,430
I think it's full healed back.

2545
01:26:39,690 --> 01:26:46,270
At the very end, I don't think you get full healed but everyone gets set to 5 hearts max and you have leather armor, stone sword.

2546
01:26:46,830 --> 01:26:51,890
And the end game is so funny because if you get a kill you heal either a heart or a heart and a half.

2547
01:26:52,230 --> 01:26:55,970
So hitting the last 10 people not only is good for points but it just lets you chain fights.

2548
01:26:56,150 --> 01:27:02,250
Like, I was on one heart and I swapped over to another 1v1 and just got a last hit on somebody and then killed the guy that they were fighting.

2549
01:27:02,810 --> 01:27:04,990
Oh, that makes so much more sense.

2550
01:27:05,170 --> 01:27:05,810
Yeah, yeah.

2551
01:27:06,970 --> 01:27:11,110
It enables a lot of the really cool clips because people can just stay alive longer than they should.

2552
01:27:11,250 --> 01:27:14,450
So I think it's a cool feature even if it's not the most fair.

2553
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:15,650
I mean, it's only one heart.

2554
01:27:17,310 --> 01:27:20,330
It's just to extend your living situation for one second.

2555
01:27:20,330 --> 01:27:21,250
Maybe it's two hearts.

2556
01:27:21,930 --> 01:27:22,670
Maybe it's two hearts.

2557
01:27:23,030 --> 01:27:26,050
My chat's correcting me and they love it more than I do.

2558
01:27:26,350 --> 01:27:28,070
Yeah, they love the game more than you do.

2559
01:27:28,750 --> 01:27:29,470
Believe it or not.

2560
01:27:30,230 --> 01:27:30,630
Crazy.

2561
01:27:31,250 --> 01:27:31,590
Insane.

2562
01:27:33,630 --> 01:27:35,470
You're just the one to put it on display.

2563
01:27:36,190 --> 01:27:39,330
In reality, your chat's actually the one getting first in the...

2564
01:27:41,190 --> 01:27:41,590
Orange...

2565
01:27:42,190 --> 01:27:42,590
and...

2566
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:45,210
Pink or purple.

2567
01:27:46,090 --> 01:27:47,150
Let's go right again.

2568
01:27:47,150 --> 01:27:48,110
Let's go right again.

2569
01:27:49,910 --> 01:27:51,370
But not right away.

2570
01:27:51,510 --> 01:27:52,290
Actually, let's just go right away.

2571
01:27:53,110 --> 01:27:54,030
Yeah, let's just go.

2572
01:27:54,490 --> 01:27:58,150
I keep expecting all these teams to be ready for a flank and they just never are.

2573
01:27:59,450 --> 01:28:00,630
No, no, get on the ladder.

2574
01:28:00,690 --> 01:28:01,810
Get on the ladder up here.

2575
01:28:03,630 --> 01:28:05,970
Let these teams fight over it and then we can... Oh my god, look!

2576
01:28:06,270 --> 01:28:07,430
Oh, he jumped.

2577
01:28:08,650 --> 01:28:09,850
I'm gonna come up.

2578
01:28:10,890 --> 01:28:11,450
I'm going up.

2579
01:28:13,970 --> 01:28:14,970
Nice, blue just below.

2580
01:28:15,030 --> 01:28:15,250
Be careful.

2581
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:19,840
Oh my god, you're so far.

2582
01:28:20,740 --> 01:28:21,660
Are you okay?

2583
01:28:21,740 --> 01:28:22,420
Will you be okay?

2584
01:28:22,660 --> 01:28:23,740
Yeah, yeah, I'll be fine.

2585
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:26,120
Get him!

2586
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:28,540
I really dislike this person.

2587
01:28:29,180 --> 01:28:30,120
I'm gonna come back to you guys.

2588
01:28:30,160 --> 01:28:30,680
You guys just chill.

2589
01:28:32,980 --> 01:28:33,700
Get him, chicken!

2590
01:28:34,420 --> 01:28:35,920
You need heals down there?

2591
01:28:36,620 --> 01:28:38,360
Wait, I can just throw this on them.

2592
01:28:40,220 --> 01:28:41,120
Purple, purple behind us!

2593
01:28:41,220 --> 01:28:41,660
Purple behind us!

2594
01:28:41,820 --> 01:28:42,940
Purple behind?

2595
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:43,760
Okay, okay, okay.

2596
01:28:44,860 --> 01:28:45,900
Fuck, I don't know what to do.

2597
01:28:46,340 --> 01:28:47,260
Stay up, stay up.

2598
01:28:47,980 --> 01:28:49,320
You can jump, you can jump down if you need to.

2599
01:28:49,420 --> 01:28:49,920
We can all jump down.

2600
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:53,600
Everyone jump all the way down to the middle.

2601
01:28:53,860 --> 01:28:54,460
All the way down to the middle.

2602
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,520
All the way down to the middle.

2603
01:28:57,780 --> 01:28:59,140
We're gonna have fun on the ice, we're gonna have fun on the ice.

2604
01:28:59,260 --> 01:28:59,940
We like the ice.

2605
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:02,800
Nice heal, nice heal!

2606
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:06,780
Went so bad, oh my god.

2607
01:29:07,220 --> 01:29:08,620
I'm throwing insta-heals for you guys.

2608
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:11,620
Oh god.

2609
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,380
I skipped the ice, I'm coming back.

2610
01:29:13,380 --> 01:29:14,600
Smoke bomb.

2611
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:17,200
This is tough.

2612
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:19,500
This is cucked, this is cucked.

2613
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:20,900
I'm getting chased down.

2614
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:21,680
Wait, I want this.

2615
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:25,240
I'm trying to target the people in low armor.

2616
01:29:25,640 --> 01:29:27,500
Cause the diamond, like you can't crit down here.

2617
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:29,100
Who's chasing me?

2618
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:32,500
Brother, come back!

2619
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:35,040
Come back, I have a delivery for you, man!

2620
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:37,280
I'm trying to heal you guys!

2621
01:29:37,660 --> 01:29:38,660
Let me live!

2622
01:29:39,460 --> 01:29:40,300
I'm living!

2623
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:41,680
I'm trying to get you!

2624
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:43,640
She got chased!

2625
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:45,960
Pan is just like, what the fuck is this guy?

2626
01:29:47,100 --> 01:29:48,180
I know, we're going so fast.

2627
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:51,560
We're going so fast, I'm trying to make sure to get to you guys.

2628
01:29:51,580 --> 01:29:55,360
Yeah, so this ice play is genuinely not the move, but I know that now, Elise.

2629
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:56,460
But it's fun.

2630
01:29:58,360 --> 01:30:00,260
Oh my god, there's blue and green here!

2631
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:03,040
Shooting seven on the ice, I'm trying to catch him off.

2632
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:05,720
Don't kill someone!

2633
01:30:06,380 --> 01:30:08,320
I'm trying to keep making sure he's dead!

2634
01:30:09,620 --> 01:30:12,020
Hold on, I'm coming, I'm looping back in.

2635
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:12,760
There's a green guy.

2636
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:20,120
We'll go the other side, that's where I'm going to cut you off.

2637
01:30:20,180 --> 01:30:21,920
I'm 45 degree ice skating, this is insane.

2638
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:23,100
Foot on three, foot on three, foot on three!

2639
01:30:23,380 --> 01:30:24,460
I'm going to cut you off.

2640
01:30:24,460 --> 01:30:26,460
It throws us on like, one HP as well.

2641
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:28,100
Yeah, it's just like, dying, dying.

2642
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:30,440
Don't worry, I'm going to cut them off.

2643
01:30:32,420 --> 01:30:33,880
Get him, get him, get him!

2644
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:37,760
I love skill-based gameplay, this is awesome.

2645
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:40,980
Are you guys okay?

2646
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:44,120
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

2647
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:45,720
I'm trying to chase Forest down here.

2648
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:46,620
Yeah, this is my opportunity.

2649
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:47,880
I'm going to go the other way.

2650
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:50,480
Okay, I stopped him.

2651
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:52,940
Oh my god, okay, I'm going the other way again!

2652
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:53,840
I'm going the other way!

2653
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:56,300
I blasted him.

2654
01:30:56,760 --> 01:30:58,100
I'm going the other way as well.

2655
01:30:58,600 --> 01:30:59,520
Six, six, six, six, six!

2656
01:31:01,020 --> 01:31:02,060
I did it, I missed!

2657
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:04,160
Five HP, five HP!

2658
01:31:04,260 --> 01:31:06,940
I swear to god.

2659
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:08,720
Where is he?

2660
01:31:08,780 --> 01:31:09,320
I'm going to get him, I'm going to get him.

2661
01:31:11,080 --> 01:31:11,460
Nice!

2662
01:31:12,020 --> 01:31:14,360
We should have grouped together.

2663
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:15,660
On me, on me, on me.

2664
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:18,840
Regen, pop the big regen.

2665
01:31:22,120 --> 01:31:22,500
Okay.

2666
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:24,300
You're scaring me.

2667
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:25,960
What the fuck was that play?

2668
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:28,880
Come over to the right here, come over to the right here.

2669
01:31:29,260 --> 01:31:29,420
Bet.

2670
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:32,000
Okay, okay, okay.

2671
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:35,000
More points.

2672
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:37,680
Alright, it's time.

2673
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:39,500
Doki items disappearing too.

2674
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:40,140
Kill one.

2675
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:41,720
Oh my god.

2676
01:31:44,180 --> 01:31:45,600
I got knocked down.

2677
01:31:46,140 --> 01:31:46,280
Alright.

2678
01:31:46,820 --> 01:31:48,000
Doki killed one.

2679
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:51,200
Okay, I gotta kill midair and I die, that's fine.

2680
01:31:52,220 --> 01:31:52,700
There's one!

2681
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:55,800
Let's try it.

2682
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:57,240
I walked off?

2683
01:31:58,720 --> 01:31:59,760
Oh shit.

2684
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:00,380
What?

2685
01:32:01,740 --> 01:32:03,860
Our points are good, our points are good.

2686
01:32:03,860 --> 01:32:05,300
Yeah, we got second though.

2687
01:32:05,380 --> 01:32:05,680
Did we?

2688
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:09,580
It's like, I walked off?

2689
01:32:11,100 --> 01:32:12,240
I guess I walked off.

2690
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:15,740
I think I got a kill as soon as I thought I died.

2691
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:17,340
So in my head I was like, oh shit, I'm dead.

2692
01:32:17,460 --> 01:32:19,880
And then I just started running around and I guess I walked off.

2693
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:26,860
I'll do my best.

2694
01:32:27,340 --> 01:32:28,540
I'll do my best, you know me.

2695
01:32:29,140 --> 01:32:29,840
Oh my goodness.

2696
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:32,500
Oh, shorting your elite third is crazy.

2697
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:38,600
That ice fight was some Looney Tunes shit right there.

2698
01:32:39,460 --> 01:32:42,940
The ice is not smart for points.

2699
01:32:43,220 --> 01:32:45,560
Because the kills take a year and a half.

2700
01:32:45,620 --> 01:32:47,620
Some fucking Looney Tunes shit.

2701
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:49,160
Beautiful gameplay.

2702
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:55,420
Is there a kit that does more damage with strafe?

2703
01:32:55,640 --> 01:32:56,900
Maybe like a...

2704
01:32:56,900 --> 01:32:57,500
I don't actually know.

2705
01:32:57,500 --> 01:32:59,920
I mean, you can use the axe kit down there.

2706
01:33:00,060 --> 01:33:03,480
But no, the ice is good to go in a minute later than we did.

2707
01:33:03,580 --> 01:33:05,220
The first two rounds it was actually smart.

2708
01:33:09,380 --> 01:33:11,460
The third one, I kind of panicked.

2709
01:33:12,660 --> 01:33:14,860
Because we were getting jumped and I wasn't with you guys.

2710
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:16,480
So I told us to go to a safe spot on the ice.

2711
01:33:16,620 --> 01:33:17,500
And it worked, but...

2712
01:33:18,060 --> 01:33:19,440
Wait, I lost my second?

2713
01:33:20,340 --> 01:33:20,960
Oh, I forgot.

2714
01:33:22,420 --> 01:33:23,300
It's chill though, I'm in third.

2715
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:24,140
Oh my god.

2716
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:26,700
It's fine, it's fine.

2717
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:27,840
It's like cool and chill.

2718
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:28,600
What am I?

2719
01:33:28,700 --> 01:33:29,320
I'm 19.

2720
01:33:29,460 --> 01:33:30,940
Oh my god, how did I drop even more?

2721
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:33,840
What did they do?

2722
01:33:34,340 --> 01:33:35,720
We're all top 20 though.

2723
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:36,880
Yeah, we're top 20.

2724
01:33:38,020 --> 01:33:40,440
I'm 64, he's going to beat me in Raze.

2725
01:33:42,820 --> 01:33:45,100
Raze in blue and purple are a little scary.

2726
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:47,260
Dude, SageMommy13th is awesome.

2727
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:47,740
That's insane.

2728
01:33:48,660 --> 01:33:49,360
Let's go, Jas!

2729
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:50,320
Bye-bye!

2730
01:33:51,660 --> 01:33:53,540
JoeBotBottomFrag is team awesome, hold on.

2731
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:55,220
This is epic.

2732
01:33:55,380 --> 01:33:56,820
I love looking at the individual boards.

2733
01:33:57,140 --> 01:33:59,060
Wait, how do you look at the individual scores?

2734
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:03,020
There's like an NPC next to the leaderboards.

2735
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:05,420
And you can right-click it.

2736
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:07,260
And it'll show you like in chat.

2737
01:34:08,300 --> 01:34:09,540
Oh, in chat!

2738
01:34:09,660 --> 01:34:10,520
I can just scroll up.

2739
01:34:11,460 --> 01:34:14,080
I was like wondering.

2740
01:34:15,100 --> 01:34:17,140
Hold on, JumperWhoOutFragXShatter?

2741
01:34:17,140 --> 01:34:18,680
Guys, I'm not last.

2742
01:34:18,820 --> 01:34:19,880
There's 40 players.

2743
01:34:20,180 --> 01:34:21,980
I'm like average.

2744
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:23,360
Let's go!

2745
01:34:25,380 --> 01:34:26,880
I'm like in the middle.

2746
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:33,320
Guys, look at all the actual Minecraft streamers.

2747
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:34,040
I'm better than.

2748
01:34:35,940 --> 01:34:38,320
Let me actually check the leaderboards.

2749
01:34:38,540 --> 01:34:40,260
Wait for the individual games.

2750
01:34:40,260 --> 01:34:40,980
Oh my god.

2751
01:34:44,020 --> 01:34:46,540
I think someone needs to humble her real quick.

2752
01:34:46,820 --> 01:34:48,660
No, no, don't do this.

2753
01:34:49,060 --> 01:34:50,400
Don't do this to me.

2754
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:51,660
I want to feel good.

2755
01:34:53,740 --> 01:34:56,500
I want to feel good about myself.

2756
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:01,500
No, I think you should be humble.

2757
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:03,040
No, please.

2758
01:35:04,540 --> 01:35:06,340
Please, I've suffered enough.

2759
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:09,260
Oh yeah, we have a break right now.

2760
01:35:09,260 --> 01:35:11,720
So if anyone needs to like eat or is hungry or whatever.

2761
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:13,460
You can take care of that real quick.

2762
01:35:13,480 --> 01:35:14,700
Oh man, maybe we'll get yogurt.

2763
01:35:15,900 --> 01:35:16,920
Yeah, I got food.

2764
01:35:17,260 --> 01:35:19,400
Oh my god, if Zan didn't kill steal me.

2765
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:20,440
I would be first in battle.

2766
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:23,140
Like I'm printing out someone in diamond armor.

2767
01:35:23,220 --> 01:35:24,380
And they take like a heart to hit.

2768
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:25,440
Because they're full diamond.

2769
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:28,980
So I'm just running for like 20 seconds.

2770
01:35:29,100 --> 01:35:31,240
And just runs fully into another team.

2771
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:33,040
Like what do you want me to do in that situation?

2772
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:35,300
So one HP and I get the kill steal.

2773
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:35,980
And I get nothing.

2774
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:36,980
So sad.

2775
01:35:36,980 --> 01:35:38,620
How many more games do we have left?

2776
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:39,500
Four.

2777
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:40,940
Maybe five.

2778
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:41,920
If we get top two.

2779
01:35:43,460 --> 01:35:44,480
Four more games.

2780
01:35:45,060 --> 01:35:47,080
Because games have been like super fast though.

2781
01:35:48,640 --> 01:35:51,440
You know what?

2782
01:35:51,460 --> 01:35:52,460
I'm getting a bowl of yogurt.

2783
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:53,780
Let's go.

2784
01:35:56,920 --> 01:35:59,140
So we have left...

2785
01:35:59,140 --> 01:36:00,440
We have race.

2786
01:36:00,700 --> 01:36:01,640
We have extraction.

2787
01:36:02,220 --> 01:36:03,640
We have party.

2788
01:36:04,260 --> 01:36:06,140
And I forgot the fourth one.

2789
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:07,060
Blizz Hunt.

2790
01:36:07,340 --> 01:36:08,660
The best game.

2791
01:36:09,820 --> 01:36:11,680
You gotta go to the Krusty Krab.

2792
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:13,260
Blizz Hunt is literally hide and seek.

2793
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:13,720
It's awesome.

2794
01:36:15,100 --> 01:36:16,560
No, no, no.

2795
01:36:16,680 --> 01:36:16,900
Fine.

2796
01:36:17,300 --> 01:36:19,160
Do you remember what I told you?

2797
01:36:19,180 --> 01:36:21,820
People still know about it is the problem.

2798
01:36:22,100 --> 01:36:22,400
Yeah.

2799
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:24,900
We just gotta manifest it.

2800
01:36:25,100 --> 01:36:27,280
So like for hide and seek.

2801
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:28,720
Is the map like a new map?

2802
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:32,180
Or is it like prop hunt where people just know where all the hiding spots are?

2803
01:36:32,180 --> 01:36:34,340
They add new rooms a lot.

2804
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:35,800
But there's like...

2805
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:37,080
They do a change of rooms.

2806
01:36:37,260 --> 01:36:39,000
It's pretty hard to memorize stuff.

2807
01:36:39,340 --> 01:36:40,180
There's like...

2808
01:36:40,180 --> 01:36:43,360
There's historically a skippity toilet spot.

2809
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:47,160
That was really good for like three or four seasons.

2810
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:48,220
Because it was just like...

2811
01:36:48,220 --> 01:36:50,240
Weird part to get to.

2812
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:51,960
And you also had to look up.

2813
01:36:52,160 --> 01:36:53,820
So even if someone saw you.

2814
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:55,060
Which most of the time they wouldn't.

2815
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:56,360
You had to...

2816
01:36:57,020 --> 01:36:58,800
They just wouldn't know how to get to you half the time.

2817
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:00,080
But now...

2818
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:01,340
Everybody knows.

2819
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:03,640
So it doesn't work anymore.

2820
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:06,140
And I'm kind of developing roof gang.

2821
01:37:06,780 --> 01:37:07,600
As the next spot.

2822
01:37:08,260 --> 01:37:09,480
But I...

2823
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:10,680
It's yet to be seen.

2824
01:37:12,440 --> 01:37:15,340
There's a room with a lot of buildings.

2825
01:37:15,740 --> 01:37:17,100
That just has like...

2826
01:37:17,100 --> 01:37:18,820
Two roofs on the build limit.

2827
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:20,940
And like...

2828
01:37:20,940 --> 01:37:22,540
You have to parkour to get up to it.

2829
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:23,720
And the parkour is not that hard.

2830
01:37:23,820 --> 01:37:26,740
But you have to very intentionally do the parkour.

2831
01:37:26,740 --> 01:37:28,820
So you can see yourself getting chased.

2832
01:37:29,060 --> 01:37:30,400
And also...

2833
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:31,360
People have to look up.

2834
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:33,220
Gamers don't look up.

2835
01:37:33,540 --> 01:37:33,860
We all know that.

2836
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:35,540
The room is kind of new.

2837
01:37:36,860 --> 01:37:37,780
Gamers don't look up.

2838
01:37:38,040 --> 01:37:40,320
Roof gang could be the next god spot.

2839
01:37:40,780 --> 01:37:42,580
There's also...

2840
01:37:42,580 --> 01:37:44,240
A couple of patented strats.

2841
01:37:44,700 --> 01:37:46,740
Most notably...

2842
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:48,340
Shit room theory.

2843
01:37:48,540 --> 01:37:49,320
Or skibity room theory.

2844
01:37:49,820 --> 01:37:51,480
Skibity room theory?

2845
01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:54,260
You hide in a terrible spot.

2846
01:37:56,380 --> 01:37:56,780
Objectively.

2847
01:37:57,120 --> 01:37:57,880
A terrible spot.

2848
01:37:58,160 --> 01:37:59,920
In one of the four rooms.

2849
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:00,600
Close to the center.

2850
01:38:00,940 --> 01:38:02,220
Maybe the first turn.

2851
01:38:02,540 --> 01:38:04,240
But you abuse the fact that...

2852
01:38:04,240 --> 01:38:05,920
Why would anyone hide in this spot?

2853
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:09,140
They're gonna check the corners.

2854
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:10,400
They're gonna check the weird stuff.

2855
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:11,720
They're not gonna check the house in the middle.

2856
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:13,600
Skibity room spot.

2857
01:38:13,980 --> 01:38:18,460
It's better to send something like that.

2858
01:38:18,660 --> 01:38:20,500
And then there's always the center room theory as well.

2859
01:38:20,620 --> 01:38:21,240
You can just wrap up.

2860
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:22,480
There's a lot.

2861
01:38:22,620 --> 01:38:24,860
Blitz is a great game.

2862
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:26,980
Everyone who says it's all luck doesn't understand it.

2863
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:29,420
For the hide and seek...

2864
01:38:29,420 --> 01:38:31,060
You have to catch you too, right?

2865
01:38:31,360 --> 01:38:31,620
Afterwards.

2866
01:38:32,300 --> 01:38:34,220
I wanna say a minute and a half.

2867
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:36,080
Your name tag is hidden.

2868
01:38:38,160 --> 01:38:39,520
And they just have to...

2869
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:40,480
One shot you.

2870
01:38:40,620 --> 01:38:42,140
And you can see them glow.

2871
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:44,180
You'll see them glow through walls.

2872
01:38:44,640 --> 01:38:47,300
And when you're hiding, you can see the runners glowing.

2873
01:38:47,460 --> 01:38:49,320
So you can move around a corner.

2874
01:38:49,320 --> 01:38:50,100
If you see them coming.

2875
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:52,380
You can leave a room if they just left it.

2876
01:38:52,420 --> 01:38:53,660
And you wanna play around like that.

2877
01:38:54,860 --> 01:38:57,640
They do have an ability.

2878
01:38:58,740 --> 01:39:00,620
I think they can use it every 20 seconds.

2879
01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:03,700
It just tells them how many people are near them.

2880
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:06,180
It doesn't reveal you glowing at all.

2881
01:39:06,420 --> 01:39:08,020
It just tells you how many people there are.

2882
01:39:08,100 --> 01:39:09,620
So if you're sitting in a corner and they use it.

2883
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:12,060
It'll say one or two if there's someone else next to you.

2884
01:39:13,420 --> 01:39:14,820
It's honestly probably good.

2885
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:15,620
And I should use it more.

2886
01:39:15,740 --> 01:39:16,980
But it doesn't reveal the people.

2887
01:39:17,180 --> 01:39:18,520
So I feel like it doesn't really matter.

2888
01:39:19,120 --> 01:39:20,220
It could help.

2889
01:39:20,660 --> 01:39:23,120
I think it helps the most when it says zero.

2890
01:39:23,320 --> 01:39:23,840
And then you just leave.

2891
01:39:24,280 --> 01:39:25,320
That's what I think helps the most.

2892
01:39:25,580 --> 01:39:27,120
It's better if you're at the very end.

2893
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:29,500
So you're deciding to run through rooms or sweep that room.

2894
01:39:29,620 --> 01:39:30,000
That's really it.

2895
01:39:30,760 --> 01:39:33,380
Oh, I'm learning.

2896
01:39:34,140 --> 01:39:34,780
I'm gonna get confident.

2897
01:39:35,480 --> 01:39:36,480
It's just God tier.

2898
01:39:39,480 --> 01:39:40,360
I see.

2899
01:39:41,500 --> 01:39:42,260
That's interesting.

2900
01:39:42,580 --> 01:39:45,020
What's the next game that usually people vote for now?

2901
01:39:46,180 --> 01:39:47,520
This one's Twitter.

2902
01:39:48,240 --> 01:39:49,200
I forgot about that.

2903
01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:50,560
It's just random and I don't care.

2904
01:39:51,080 --> 01:39:52,620
Oh my God, it's gonna be Blitzhunt.

2905
01:39:53,940 --> 01:39:55,140
Usually Blitzhunt's late.

2906
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:56,040
But that's good.

2907
01:39:57,140 --> 01:39:58,020
People voted.

2908
01:39:58,160 --> 01:39:59,740
It's because you guys all talked about Blitzhunt.

2909
01:39:59,900 --> 01:40:01,120
So everyone's like, we might as well.

2910
01:40:02,200 --> 01:40:02,620
I guess.

2911
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:03,880
We forgot.

2912
01:40:04,140 --> 01:40:04,880
I say we.

2913
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,200
I forgot to mention that there's a Twitter poll.

2914
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:09,180
We could actually probably influence the vote a lot.

2915
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:11,820
It's because it's whatever's the second most.

2916
01:40:12,100 --> 01:40:13,820
And then Twitter API always lags.

2917
01:40:13,820 --> 01:40:15,320
So it is just kind of effectively random.

2918
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:17,980
You can get it done like a 50-50.

2919
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:18,840
If you vote for Twitter.

2920
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:20,400
The way we were doing it last time.

2921
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:22,920
Purple would get on the mic.

2922
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:24,300
And he would just go, okay.

2923
01:40:24,620 --> 01:40:28,280
Everyone born in January and April 1st.

2924
01:40:30,060 --> 01:40:30,820
That's crazy.

2925
01:40:31,140 --> 01:40:32,600
He would separate my birthdays.

2926
01:40:32,920 --> 01:40:33,900
I was like, you're crazy.

2927
01:40:35,680 --> 01:40:36,580
But it worked.

2928
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:39,220
We actually made it work so many times.

2929
01:40:40,460 --> 01:40:40,900
Oh.

2930
01:40:41,560 --> 01:40:41,960
Oh.

2931
01:40:43,240 --> 01:40:43,640
What?

2932
01:40:47,140 --> 01:40:47,860
That's a bad joke.

2933
01:40:48,100 --> 01:40:48,780
That's a bad joke.

2934
01:40:48,940 --> 01:40:49,360
I'm so sorry.

2935
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:51,400
If you don't respond.

2936
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:54,420
If you don't click ready.

2937
01:40:54,780 --> 01:40:55,920
Oh, it does.

2938
01:40:57,980 --> 01:40:58,380
Okay.

2939
01:40:58,520 --> 01:41:00,460
Because he's making a sandwich.

2940
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:01,080
I understand.

2941
01:41:01,200 --> 01:41:04,640
I already had my sandwich.

2942
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:05,340
I'm eating it now.

2943
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:06,740
I should have been prepared.

2944
01:41:06,740 --> 01:41:08,860
I already ate my breakfast.

2945
01:41:09,120 --> 01:41:10,740
At 7 in the morning.

2946
01:41:12,360 --> 01:41:14,540
And then I went back to sleep.

2947
01:41:24,840 --> 01:41:26,480
In the spawn.

2948
01:41:26,660 --> 01:41:28,020
There's like a scary.

2949
01:41:28,420 --> 01:41:29,760
Version of the mascot.

2950
01:41:30,140 --> 01:41:30,700
At the top.

2951
01:41:31,320 --> 01:41:33,360
I saw him.

2952
01:41:34,040 --> 01:41:34,980
It was in the.

2953
01:41:35,120 --> 01:41:36,680
It was in the CGI.

2954
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:37,960
Wait, where?

2955
01:41:40,120 --> 01:41:41,440
It's going crazy right now.

2956
01:41:41,580 --> 01:41:42,260
Oh my god.

2957
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:43,660
It's Halloween themed.

2958
01:41:44,740 --> 01:41:45,580
I'm ready.

2959
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:50,260
Gumi, what the fuck was that discord message?

2960
01:41:51,540 --> 01:41:51,980
Oh.

2961
01:41:54,900 --> 01:41:56,820
You gave me no context.

2962
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,320
Oh my god, he's going crazy right now.

2963
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:01,540
Maximum spinach.

2964
01:42:01,540 --> 01:42:02,480
Maximum spinach.

2965
01:42:02,860 --> 01:42:04,040
Can I just reply?

2966
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:13,960
I love graham crackers.

2967
01:42:14,700 --> 01:42:15,660
I love Minecraft.

2968
01:42:16,140 --> 01:42:17,960
I love MILFs.

2969
01:42:18,720 --> 01:42:20,440
I agree with all three of them.

2970
01:42:23,380 --> 01:42:25,200
Would be a crazy combination.

2971
01:42:26,220 --> 01:42:27,160
Graham cracker, MILF, graham cracker.

2972
01:42:27,160 --> 01:42:28,460
Oh man, I have ideas.

2973
01:42:37,820 --> 01:42:38,480
I'm looking good Saturday.

2974
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:39,720
Why are we pausing?

2975
01:42:40,180 --> 01:42:41,340
Is somebody still eating?

2976
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:44,540
Oh.

2977
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:48,230
Red team is just hating on playing the games.

2978
01:42:49,810 --> 01:42:51,080
Red team hates Minecraft.

2979
01:42:51,080 --> 01:42:53,100
If they keep not responding time.

2980
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:54,600
You should just take points away.

2981
01:42:56,020 --> 01:42:56,920
I agree.

2982
01:42:57,440 --> 01:42:59,500
I mean, you could literally do that right now.

2983
01:42:59,500 --> 01:42:59,920
What?

2984
01:43:00,640 --> 01:43:01,760
Well, I don't have admin firms.

2985
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:05,160
They take away my admin firms when I...

2986
01:43:05,160 --> 01:43:07,320
How can they take away your admin firms?

2987
01:43:07,380 --> 01:43:08,580
You're literally the creator.

2988
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:10,140
You're gone.

2989
01:43:10,220 --> 01:43:11,200
Well, I don't make everything.

2990
01:43:11,780 --> 01:43:13,280
I make some of the parts.

2991
01:43:14,780 --> 01:43:15,880
You should pretend you made all of it.

2992
01:43:16,020 --> 01:43:18,080
Yeah, you should take all the credit.

2993
01:43:19,720 --> 01:43:21,100
Be a real CEO.

2994
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:22,860
And my logo on everything.

2995
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:26,580
Renaming the event the Wolfy Wars.

2996
01:43:27,120 --> 01:43:27,560
Exactly.

2997
01:43:27,720 --> 01:43:29,420
You should put your own name on it.

2998
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:31,040
It's all about the branding.

2999
01:43:32,580 --> 01:43:33,020
Exactly.

3000
01:43:34,420 --> 01:43:36,600
I should have paid more attention in marketing class.

3001
01:43:36,900 --> 01:43:38,000
I'm failing here.

3002
01:43:38,680 --> 01:43:40,880
Maybe I get more nervous for this game than I do.

3003
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:42,360
Really?

3004
01:43:42,820 --> 01:43:43,980
Do you get nervous for this game?

3005
01:43:44,060 --> 01:43:45,720
I get tingles, man.

3006
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:46,540
Do you get tingles?

3007
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:48,420
I've never had a bad experience.

3008
01:43:48,680 --> 01:43:51,240
I'm scared the one time I have a bad experience.

3009
01:43:51,240 --> 01:43:52,860
I don't even know where to go.

3010
01:43:52,860 --> 01:43:53,720
I know it's in this game.

3011
01:43:53,820 --> 01:43:54,660
Brain turned off.

3012
01:43:54,760 --> 01:43:55,940
I sit in the corner and I'm right.

3013
01:43:56,760 --> 01:43:59,080
You tap out and then you're like, alright.

3014
01:44:00,860 --> 01:44:02,920
I'm just fully locked out in this game.

3015
01:44:03,940 --> 01:44:05,720
Okay, so there are north, south, east, west rooms.

3016
01:44:05,900 --> 01:44:06,780
And then there are corner rooms.

3017
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:08,100
I don't know where to go.

3018
01:44:08,340 --> 01:44:10,260
No, no, no.

3019
01:44:10,660 --> 01:44:11,340
I'm going west.

3020
01:44:12,340 --> 01:44:13,700
You can try it.

3021
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:15,340
My friendship's over.

3022
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:17,580
I'll commit.

3023
01:44:17,580 --> 01:44:18,700
They know.

3024
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:20,780
I'm going west.

3025
01:44:22,380 --> 01:44:23,640
Wait, there's nobody going east.

3026
01:44:23,860 --> 01:44:24,880
Why is no one going east?

3027
01:44:25,060 --> 01:44:26,120
Everybody's going west.

3028
01:44:26,340 --> 01:44:27,660
They saw the skibbity room.

3029
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:31,000
Is east a skibbity room?

3030
01:44:31,660 --> 01:44:34,480
South, south, skibbity room.

3031
01:44:35,780 --> 01:44:38,480
This is going to be phenomenal gameplay.

3032
01:44:38,640 --> 01:44:38,980
Hold on.

3033
01:44:39,260 --> 01:44:39,760
Oh, no.

3034
01:44:40,840 --> 01:44:41,840
Oh, huh.

3035
01:44:42,740 --> 01:44:43,660
There's a hole.

3036
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:45,300
Okay, there's a spot.

3037
01:44:45,500 --> 01:44:46,180
Actually, that's going to blow.

3038
01:44:48,460 --> 01:44:50,660
I'm no longer going to skibbity room.

3039
01:44:50,820 --> 01:44:51,560
I'm leaving.

3040
01:44:52,840 --> 01:44:53,700
Where am I?

3041
01:44:53,820 --> 01:44:55,140
Oh, there is a hole in it.

3042
01:44:55,160 --> 01:44:55,620
Oh, my God.

3043
01:44:55,940 --> 01:44:58,180
Guys, I might be the first one caught.

3044
01:44:59,100 --> 01:45:01,260
I might be the first one caught going up the skibbity toilet.

3045
01:45:04,860 --> 01:45:06,780
Ain't no way I get gunned for first.

3046
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:07,460
That's crazy.

3047
01:45:09,580 --> 01:45:10,080
That's crazy.

3048
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:10,860
What is he doing not in the corner?

3049
01:45:11,140 --> 01:45:16,660
He just randomly decided, Hey, I'm going to go do this random parkour jump and check behind the tree.

3050
01:45:17,080 --> 01:45:19,340
Like, there's people literally in the sky visible.

3051
01:45:19,740 --> 01:45:20,040
Okay, whatever.

3052
01:45:20,540 --> 01:45:21,000
It's fine.

3053
01:45:21,940 --> 01:45:22,740
It doesn't matter.

3054
01:45:22,860 --> 01:45:23,520
It's chill, actually.

3055
01:45:24,520 --> 01:45:25,280
Oh, no.

3056
01:45:25,880 --> 01:45:26,360
Rootberries.

3057
01:45:27,200 --> 01:45:28,180
Center room theory.

3058
01:45:28,540 --> 01:45:29,580
Not working out for him.

3059
01:45:29,620 --> 01:45:30,760
Parkour on the prowl here.

3060
01:45:31,220 --> 01:45:34,040
Can't see them either anymore.

3061
01:45:34,260 --> 01:45:36,480
Dude, my tree has treated me well so far.

3062
01:45:36,480 --> 01:45:37,700
I'm just kidding.

3063
01:45:38,120 --> 01:45:39,740
Wait, you're in the same room I was in.

3064
01:45:40,120 --> 01:45:40,980
This is rigged.

3065
01:45:41,560 --> 01:45:43,860
Oh, never mind.

3066
01:45:44,020 --> 01:45:45,040
Laguna doesn't look right.

3067
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:49,360
Hold on.

3068
01:45:49,640 --> 01:45:51,400
Everyone else on the team is cooking, though.

3069
01:45:51,780 --> 01:45:53,560
Goomy's in the cube, whatever room.

3070
01:45:54,420 --> 01:45:56,640
I'm employing center room theory here.

3071
01:45:56,760 --> 01:45:57,940
Are they going to clear the center corner?

3072
01:45:57,960 --> 01:46:00,640
Doki's just in the gamer spot, clearly.

3073
01:46:01,400 --> 01:46:03,640
Dang, taken out by parkour here.

3074
01:46:03,640 --> 01:46:05,280
20 seconds left.

3075
01:46:05,420 --> 01:46:06,240
This is where I died.

3076
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:09,600
No, no, no, you're good.

3077
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:11,400
Okay, your time is limited.

3078
01:46:12,040 --> 01:46:13,420
No, you might be okay.

3079
01:46:13,460 --> 01:46:14,640
You might be okay.

3080
01:46:14,820 --> 01:46:14,960
Stick.

3081
01:46:16,580 --> 01:46:16,640
Stick.

3082
01:46:16,940 --> 01:46:17,940
Wait, he didn't see you.

3083
01:46:18,280 --> 01:46:18,440
Believe.

3084
01:46:18,920 --> 01:46:20,140
Oh, he's going to go.

3085
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:21,900
No, he's not.

3086
01:46:22,680 --> 01:46:23,120
Zero!

3087
01:46:25,140 --> 01:46:26,100
We did it!

3088
01:46:26,460 --> 01:46:27,980
David's still locked down, either!

3089
01:46:28,640 --> 01:46:31,800
Oh, we're hunting.

3090
01:46:31,800 --> 01:46:32,600
Okay, okay, okay.

3091
01:46:33,340 --> 01:46:37,560
Just run around and try to check the corners and you can use your eye ability thing.

3092
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:39,240
I'm going to go south at the start.

3093
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:40,560
Everyone just get walled.

3094
01:46:41,300 --> 01:46:42,100
Everyone split.

3095
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:42,960
I'll go west.

3096
01:46:42,980 --> 01:46:44,560
I'm going to go north and head west.

3097
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:45,960
Doki, you can go with Giga.

3098
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:47,360
Okay, there you are.

3099
01:46:47,740 --> 01:46:50,720
Go north and then you go right.

3100
01:46:50,860 --> 01:46:51,400
I'll go north and I'll go left.

3101
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:54,040
I'll sweep that room.

3102
01:46:55,580 --> 01:46:56,560
No center room.

3103
01:46:56,580 --> 01:46:58,720
You can see people go in the center from here.

3104
01:46:58,720 --> 01:47:00,380
With the darkness, you can see.

3105
01:47:01,080 --> 01:47:01,300
Yeah.

3106
01:47:02,640 --> 01:47:04,300
I'll do a mid-sweep at the end.

3107
01:47:04,380 --> 01:47:05,660
People usually move to mid.

3108
01:47:06,380 --> 01:47:06,940
They do?

3109
01:47:08,260 --> 01:47:09,660
I just stuck in the corner.

3110
01:47:10,260 --> 01:47:11,900
Check the left side of this room.

3111
01:47:16,760 --> 01:47:19,640
Oh, I see you.

3112
01:47:20,200 --> 01:47:21,280
I see a gamer on me.

3113
01:47:22,620 --> 01:47:23,900
She's just running away.

3114
01:47:25,380 --> 01:47:26,340
How did I not hit him?

3115
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:27,360
You see that girl?

3116
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:29,240
There's a bunch of people.

3117
01:47:29,380 --> 01:47:30,520
We did it.

3118
01:47:32,200 --> 01:47:33,840
There's someone running towards mid.

3119
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:35,320
I got another.

3120
01:47:36,660 --> 01:47:37,180
Nice.

3121
01:47:38,220 --> 01:47:39,000
Hold on.

3122
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:40,400
I found Cam.

3123
01:47:41,720 --> 01:47:42,560
Where did he go?

3124
01:47:43,320 --> 01:47:44,680
Oh, there was another one.

3125
01:47:45,420 --> 01:47:46,140
Come back here.

3126
01:47:46,240 --> 01:47:46,820
Who is that?

3127
01:47:47,100 --> 01:47:48,780
He ran out.

3128
01:47:50,280 --> 01:47:51,100
Come on.

3129
01:47:51,560 --> 01:47:51,740
Huge.

3130
01:47:52,440 --> 01:47:53,980
Where did Cam go?

3131
01:47:53,980 --> 01:47:54,040
I don't know.

3132
01:47:55,560 --> 01:47:56,760
I'm just gonna ignore this room.

3133
01:47:57,080 --> 01:47:57,860
Oh, I should use my sonar.

3134
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:00,840
That's what I've been doing too.

3135
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:02,820
I found you.

3136
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:04,960
Damn, that's...

3137
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:06,340
Oh, there's a player near me.

3138
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:08,580
And I missed both of them.

3139
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:09,860
I got another.

3140
01:48:11,140 --> 01:48:12,060
Hold on, come back.

3141
01:48:13,160 --> 01:48:14,440
There's someone here.

3142
01:48:14,580 --> 01:48:15,320
What is this?

3143
01:48:17,100 --> 01:48:18,540
I got one.

3144
01:48:19,900 --> 01:48:20,960
I got three.

3145
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:22,000
I'm getting tossed around right now.

3146
01:48:22,580 --> 01:48:23,420
I'm getting tossed like a fish.

3147
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:25,920
Come back here.

3148
01:48:27,880 --> 01:48:28,280
Fuck.

3149
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:31,660
I'm whiffing on the parkour.

3150
01:48:31,940 --> 01:48:32,100
Okay.

3151
01:48:33,680 --> 01:48:35,980
I'm getting the people who are not parkouring.

3152
01:48:37,100 --> 01:48:38,560
Okay, we did pretty solid, I think.

3153
01:48:39,560 --> 01:48:40,320
I got seven.

3154
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:41,720
I got three.

3155
01:48:42,180 --> 01:48:43,500
I also got seven, apparently.

3156
01:48:44,760 --> 01:48:50,740
I saw a player head in the room and I didn't know if it was an actual player head or a person.

3157
01:48:51,280 --> 01:48:55,840
It looked like a placed Steve head or something.

3158
01:48:56,240 --> 01:49:00,480
Oh my god, this is Roof Gang.

3159
01:49:01,140 --> 01:49:02,600
Is this the actual one?

3160
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:06,880
If you want to test Roof Gang North, you have to remember how to get out.

3161
01:49:08,040 --> 01:49:09,040
This is not the Roof Gang one.

3162
01:49:09,480 --> 01:49:11,240
Oh my god, it's not Roof Gang.

3163
01:49:12,300 --> 01:49:12,680
Panic.

3164
01:49:14,660 --> 01:49:17,020
What the fuck is this room?

3165
01:49:18,420 --> 01:49:19,700
I'm so scared.

3166
01:49:20,620 --> 01:49:21,560
I'm just going in here.

3167
01:49:21,640 --> 01:49:22,680
This room is terrible.

3168
01:49:24,240 --> 01:49:25,900
This is such an awful way.

3169
01:49:26,040 --> 01:49:27,180
Oh, that just didn't go my way.

3170
01:49:27,240 --> 01:49:28,000
Oh, that's awesome, actually.

3171
01:49:28,700 --> 01:49:29,960
This room is awful.

3172
01:49:30,260 --> 01:49:31,400
Terrible idea mode.

3173
01:49:31,600 --> 01:49:33,040
I might be dead, guys.

3174
01:49:33,940 --> 01:49:34,960
Wait, this is that?

3175
01:49:35,060 --> 01:49:36,360
There is a Skibbity Toilet Room.

3176
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:37,920
It just said it in my head.

3177
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:41,780
Dude, I see the god spots in the Skibbity Toilet Room.

3178
01:49:43,340 --> 01:49:44,600
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.

3179
01:49:45,020 --> 01:49:48,100
In the Skibbity, I see somebody in the Skibbity.

3180
01:49:49,420 --> 01:49:50,620
In the Skibbity.

3181
01:49:51,260 --> 01:49:52,320
Are you on the other side of the map?

3182
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:53,320
I don't know what direction it is.

3183
01:49:54,180 --> 01:49:56,000
There's someone literally in the Skibbity.

3184
01:49:57,800 --> 01:49:58,740
I'm not kidding.

3185
01:49:59,220 --> 01:50:00,220
You can go in the Skibbity.

3186
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:02,580
Oh no, Keegan, no.

3187
01:50:03,260 --> 01:50:04,160
The hunters aren't looking at you.

3188
01:50:04,300 --> 01:50:05,420
I can just run around.

3189
01:50:05,880 --> 01:50:06,920
Just in the middle, just chilling.

3190
01:50:07,100 --> 01:50:07,940
Yeah, they're not going to check anyways.

3191
01:50:08,820 --> 01:50:09,840
What does it matter?

3192
01:50:10,620 --> 01:50:11,600
I'm hunting now.

3193
01:50:11,720 --> 01:50:12,540
I'm hunting for the hunters.

3194
01:50:12,720 --> 01:50:13,080
They don't see me.

3195
01:50:13,120 --> 01:50:13,720
Oh, they saw me.

3196
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:14,420
Oh fuck, never mind.

3197
01:50:16,820 --> 01:50:18,720
Oh, he's on you too.

3198
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:20,000
Oh no, please.

3199
01:50:20,720 --> 01:50:21,540
I didn't mean to.

3200
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:24,760
Please, I didn't mean to be here.

3201
01:50:27,040 --> 01:50:29,060
I think he saw me.

3202
01:50:29,680 --> 01:50:30,880
Oh, I just ran into all of them.

3203
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:31,160
No!

3204
01:50:33,160 --> 01:50:34,060
Oh my god.

3205
01:50:34,220 --> 01:50:34,480
Wait.

3206
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:38,380
Oh my god.

3207
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:40,920
I need to know what room this is.

3208
01:50:41,340 --> 01:50:43,240
Oh my god.

3209
01:50:43,240 --> 01:50:46,840
Don't smell me.

3210
01:50:46,920 --> 01:50:47,400
Don't smell me.

3211
01:50:47,580 --> 01:50:48,620
This is insane.

3212
01:50:50,200 --> 01:50:52,020
Skibbity room meta is insane.

3213
01:50:52,660 --> 01:50:53,040
True Skibbity.

3214
01:50:53,460 --> 01:50:56,360
We should have all went to the Skibbity room to get there.

3215
01:50:56,380 --> 01:50:57,940
They killed so many people.

3216
01:50:58,080 --> 01:51:00,780
We should have all went to that room to get there.

3217
01:51:01,180 --> 01:51:03,300
I didn't notice it was so late.

3218
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:04,640
Is it still there?

3219
01:51:04,760 --> 01:51:05,360
Is the Skibbity room still there?

3220
01:51:05,760 --> 01:51:06,460
It's random.

3221
01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:09,180
Mushroom, right?

3222
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:10,700
Mushroom, get it?

3223
01:51:10,760 --> 01:51:11,440
It's a mushroom.

3224
01:51:12,540 --> 01:51:12,980
Oh my god.

3225
01:51:17,160 --> 01:51:18,340
I'm going to go stealth.

3226
01:51:19,120 --> 01:51:20,180
Oh fuck, we started.

3227
01:51:20,720 --> 01:51:21,200
Okay, hold on.

3228
01:51:21,900 --> 01:51:22,860
I'm checking for Skibbity.

3229
01:51:24,300 --> 01:51:25,880
No, but there's a basketball court.

3230
01:51:26,340 --> 01:51:26,780
Hello.

3231
01:51:30,520 --> 01:51:31,720
I'm going to be balling on him.

3232
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:37,800
Okay, this room is kind of trapped.

3233
01:51:37,840 --> 01:51:38,880
I'm sort of...

3234
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:40,500
I don't have a hiding spot.

3235
01:51:40,600 --> 01:51:41,440
I'm just existing.

3236
01:51:43,940 --> 01:51:45,760
If I die, I die.

3237
01:51:46,020 --> 01:51:47,100
I tried a trapdoor flick.

3238
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:48,740
I don't know if I would get yelled at for that.

3239
01:51:48,900 --> 01:51:49,560
But it didn't work anyways.

3240
01:51:50,060 --> 01:51:50,320
Okay.

3241
01:51:51,860 --> 01:51:53,900
I mean, surely they won't check, right?

3242
01:51:54,680 --> 01:51:55,360
Gamers don't look up.

3243
01:51:56,080 --> 01:51:57,960
Oh, he's looking up right now.

3244
01:51:58,300 --> 01:51:59,340
Oh, he is looking up.

3245
01:51:59,720 --> 01:52:00,820
Oh, you are being looked at.

3246
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:01,600
Upwards.

3247
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:05,700
Now how the fuck did that happen?

3248
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:08,760
How the fuck did he just decide, Hey, let me check behind the box on the other side of the map.

3249
01:52:08,820 --> 01:52:09,480
Okay, nevermind.

3250
01:52:09,620 --> 01:52:10,020
It's fine.

3251
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:10,400
It's okay.

3252
01:52:11,180 --> 01:52:13,520
This is not good for me.

3253
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:14,140
This is really scary.

3254
01:52:14,280 --> 01:52:16,220
There's like 20 million people in this room.

3255
01:52:17,460 --> 01:52:18,200
What the...

3256
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:21,260
Dude, not good for me.

3257
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:22,800
Not good for me.

3258
01:52:23,180 --> 01:52:24,420
What the hell, bro?

3259
01:52:25,680 --> 01:52:26,340
Not good.

3260
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:27,300
Hold on.

3261
01:52:27,580 --> 01:52:29,660
I see Giga is just chilling inside of a box.

3262
01:52:29,900 --> 01:52:30,320
Do they know?

3263
01:52:30,860 --> 01:52:31,480
Oh, they know.

3264
01:52:31,620 --> 01:52:31,960
Oh, they know.

3265
01:52:32,180 --> 01:52:33,100
Oh, they know.

3266
01:52:33,240 --> 01:52:33,760
Oh, I'm lucky.

3267
01:52:34,180 --> 01:52:35,440
It got slowed down right there.

3268
01:52:35,880 --> 01:52:37,100
Unfortunate, but...

3269
01:52:37,680 --> 01:52:39,220
Let's see the other squad.

3270
01:52:40,780 --> 01:52:41,100
Crazy.

3271
01:52:41,680 --> 01:52:42,400
Hold on.

3272
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:45,060
Do they look?

3273
01:52:45,140 --> 01:52:45,700
They don't look back.

3274
01:52:45,860 --> 01:52:46,340
They just don't look.

3275
01:52:47,020 --> 01:52:47,500
Anthos.

3276
01:52:48,540 --> 01:52:48,780
Anthos.

3277
01:52:48,940 --> 01:52:49,140
Anthos.

3278
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:50,120
Anthos.

3279
01:52:50,160 --> 01:52:50,160
Anthos.

3280
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:50,400
Anthos.

3281
01:52:50,660 --> 01:52:51,000
Anthos.

3282
01:52:51,160 --> 01:52:51,420
Anthos.

3283
01:52:52,140 --> 01:52:52,620
Anthos.

3284
01:52:52,620 --> 01:52:55,120
We live, Giga!

3285
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:56,960
I died.

3286
01:52:58,800 --> 01:52:59,820
You guys are alive.

3287
01:52:59,880 --> 01:53:00,660
You guys are alive, though.

3288
01:53:01,740 --> 01:53:03,100
They're just running circles.

3289
01:53:03,280 --> 01:53:03,700
It doesn't matter.

3290
01:53:04,140 --> 01:53:04,600
Oh, no.

3291
01:53:05,880 --> 01:53:06,840
Gumi not spotted.

3292
01:53:07,440 --> 01:53:07,940
Yes!

3293
01:53:09,240 --> 01:53:10,100
Let's go!

3294
01:53:11,260 --> 01:53:13,200
I live at the last second!

3295
01:53:15,660 --> 01:53:17,000
Holy fuck, man.

3296
01:53:17,260 --> 01:53:19,980
This game gets such and such a rush, bro.

3297
01:53:20,620 --> 01:53:21,240
Oh, man.

3298
01:53:21,460 --> 01:53:22,680
At the last second.

3299
01:53:23,420 --> 01:53:23,840
Oh, no.

3300
01:53:23,880 --> 01:53:24,860
Thunder's ahead now.

3301
01:53:26,020 --> 01:53:27,020
I'm gonna head north, too.

3302
01:53:27,080 --> 01:53:27,400
I'm fine.

3303
01:53:28,240 --> 01:53:29,880
I am south-gang right now.

3304
01:53:29,960 --> 01:53:31,500
Call it out if you get Skibity.

3305
01:53:32,100 --> 01:53:33,900
I just...

3306
01:53:34,740 --> 01:53:36,360
It'll be good, but...

3307
01:53:36,780 --> 01:53:37,880
I'm locked out.

3308
01:53:39,100 --> 01:53:40,680
I'm fully locked out.

3309
01:53:40,900 --> 01:53:41,940
My brain needs to turn on.

3310
01:53:42,500 --> 01:53:43,420
Oh, wait!

3311
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:44,040
Spongebob!

3312
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:45,580
Wait, what?

3313
01:53:46,100 --> 01:53:47,280
Yeah, I'm in the sponge room.

3314
01:53:47,560 --> 01:53:49,580
If we die, we both die together.

3315
01:53:51,280 --> 01:53:52,620
Holy shit, this room's bad!

3316
01:53:53,300 --> 01:53:54,300
Holy shit, this room's bad!

3317
01:53:54,860 --> 01:53:56,100
Holy fuck, this room's bad!

3318
01:53:56,800 --> 01:53:58,240
I'm with a Thunder teammate.

3319
01:53:58,600 --> 01:54:00,900
I will bring this Thunder teammate down with me.

3320
01:54:01,340 --> 01:54:04,200
There's spots in the whole room!

3321
01:54:04,740 --> 01:54:05,460
Oh, no.

3322
01:54:06,940 --> 01:54:08,900
Dude, I'm in like a 1x2.

3323
01:54:09,340 --> 01:54:10,020
What is this?

3324
01:54:10,520 --> 01:54:12,240
I don't think I'm in a good spot.

3325
01:54:16,700 --> 01:54:18,680
Okay, I'm risking my life.

3326
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:19,900
Surely they do not check in here.

3327
01:54:20,680 --> 01:54:20,900
Nope.

3328
01:54:22,480 --> 01:54:23,060
Okay, yeah, I'm good.

3329
01:54:23,060 --> 01:54:25,380
I'm with a Thunder teammate, so like...

3330
01:54:25,380 --> 01:54:27,740
I will bring down the Thunder teammate with me.

3331
01:54:28,980 --> 01:54:30,820
There's a Thunder teammate who died right below me.

3332
01:54:33,820 --> 01:54:35,120
Oh my god!

3333
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:35,880
I see a cliff!

3334
01:54:35,980 --> 01:54:36,560
I see a cliff!

3335
01:54:36,760 --> 01:54:38,180
I see a cliff in the grave!

3336
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:41,000
Oh my god.

3337
01:54:41,540 --> 01:54:43,260
Dude, I am so Karuza'd right now.

3338
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:44,020
Oh no!

3339
01:54:45,660 --> 01:54:47,120
I was in Patrick's house.

3340
01:54:47,620 --> 01:54:48,480
I'm in a 1x2.

3341
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:51,040
I'm in like the exhaust of the Krusty Krab.

3342
01:54:51,360 --> 01:54:53,680
Wait, this spot that Firebreath Man is in is so good.

3343
01:54:54,500 --> 01:54:57,220
I'm hiding in his fucking hitbox right now.

3344
01:54:58,020 --> 01:55:00,020
We both go down together, Thunder.

3345
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:03,240
Oh no!

3346
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:04,280
You died?

3347
01:55:04,500 --> 01:55:06,500
Dude, look at the spot that Firebreath Man is in.

3348
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:07,660
It's next to the Krusty Krab.

3349
01:55:07,880 --> 01:55:09,560
It's opposite the little thing.

3350
01:55:09,620 --> 01:55:10,600
He's a Krusty Krab?

3351
01:55:11,600 --> 01:55:12,560
Oh, I see him.

3352
01:55:12,780 --> 01:55:13,320
You see that?

3353
01:55:13,680 --> 01:55:15,040
Oh shit, that's really good.

3354
01:55:15,060 --> 01:55:15,660
That's really good.

3355
01:55:15,700 --> 01:55:16,120
Look at Joe.

3356
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:18,120
I'm in a really good spot.

3357
01:55:18,540 --> 01:55:19,700
Hold on, what's up squad?

3358
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:22,260
I'm inside him.

3359
01:55:23,500 --> 01:55:23,900
Yay!

3360
01:55:24,280 --> 01:55:25,300
What's up squad?

3361
01:55:25,420 --> 01:55:25,920
You hurt?

3362
01:55:27,660 --> 01:55:29,080
Oh, I see, I see.

3363
01:55:29,080 --> 01:55:31,160
Holy shit, there's still three more rounds of this?

3364
01:55:34,920 --> 01:55:36,360
Everyone has to go.

3365
01:55:36,580 --> 01:55:37,880
Oh my god.

3366
01:55:37,980 --> 01:55:40,160
I don't recognize the room I'm in.

3367
01:55:40,340 --> 01:55:41,020
This is new.

3368
01:55:42,340 --> 01:55:43,700
I'm gonna go to the new room.

3369
01:55:43,780 --> 01:55:44,420
Maybe it's goated.

3370
01:55:44,700 --> 01:55:46,740
I'm tired of hiding already.

3371
01:55:47,340 --> 01:55:48,640
It's too much pressure.

3372
01:55:49,240 --> 01:55:50,100
It's too much.

3373
01:55:50,440 --> 01:55:51,720
It's freaking me out, man.

3374
01:55:51,960 --> 01:55:53,240
Ice room?

3375
01:55:53,380 --> 01:55:55,180
Okay, I don't know where to hide in this new one.

3376
01:55:55,280 --> 01:55:56,360
I'm just gonna wing it.

3377
01:56:00,020 --> 01:56:01,940
What the hell is this?

3378
01:56:02,500 --> 01:56:03,200
What the fuck?

3379
01:56:04,200 --> 01:56:05,200
Where do I even go?

3380
01:56:05,680 --> 01:56:06,520
GG, I lost.

3381
01:56:08,080 --> 01:56:09,000
Okay, I'm just...

3382
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,080
This is really bad.

3383
01:56:11,640 --> 01:56:12,520
I'm dead, I'm dead.

3384
01:56:12,600 --> 01:56:15,580
I thought I was being really clever, but I'm dead.

3385
01:56:17,140 --> 01:56:18,080
Please don't go up, please don't go up.

3386
01:56:18,340 --> 01:56:19,420
We're good, we're good.

3387
01:56:19,880 --> 01:56:21,160
Goodbye might be the first one eliminated.

3388
01:56:22,620 --> 01:56:23,700
No, you're chilling, you're chilling.

3389
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:24,700
No!

3390
01:56:26,640 --> 01:56:28,360
He turned around!

3391
01:56:28,720 --> 01:56:29,920
He actually did!

3392
01:56:31,980 --> 01:56:35,700
I was like, no, this is the dumbest thing I've done.

3393
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,960
Wait, don't look at my spot!

3394
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:39,100
Wait, where are you?

3395
01:56:40,120 --> 01:56:41,960
I was in the same room you were in.

3396
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:43,500
Oh my god, oh my god.

3397
01:56:43,980 --> 01:56:45,920
Surely they can't find me, right?

3398
01:56:46,760 --> 01:56:48,220
Wait, what is...

3399
01:56:48,220 --> 01:56:50,580
What is this?

3400
01:56:51,300 --> 01:56:53,080
Gumi, what the fuck?

3401
01:56:53,080 --> 01:56:53,300
Gumi!

3402
01:56:54,420 --> 01:56:54,880
Gumi!

3403
01:56:56,480 --> 01:56:57,820
I'm not Gumi!

3404
01:56:58,300 --> 01:56:59,240
I'm JCB.

3405
01:56:59,640 --> 01:57:02,540
You can't fucking hide in this room, man.

3406
01:57:02,660 --> 01:57:06,320
I'm dead, but I see your little stupid guy and you are...

3407
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:08,280
You are up in this room, I'll tell you that.

3408
01:57:08,280 --> 01:57:11,400
This is crazy, I'm hiding behind a one-by-one wall.

3409
01:57:12,360 --> 01:57:13,120
This is insane.

3410
01:57:14,940 --> 01:57:16,100
Where are they?

3411
01:57:16,320 --> 01:57:19,220
Can you not move when you die so I can scout?

3412
01:57:19,600 --> 01:57:20,580
For like a second or two?

3413
01:57:20,580 --> 01:57:21,520
This spot is crazy.

3414
01:57:22,580 --> 01:57:23,640
I've been detected.

3415
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:24,900
Oh, boohoo, man.

3416
01:57:25,360 --> 01:57:25,880
Unlucky.

3417
01:57:28,580 --> 01:57:30,120
You're in the wrong room, buddy.

3418
01:57:30,680 --> 01:57:31,520
Good luck.

3419
01:57:31,880 --> 01:57:33,700
I gotta find this spot.

3420
01:57:34,060 --> 01:57:35,100
Don't move for a second.

3421
01:57:35,500 --> 01:57:36,640
Go, go, go.

3422
01:57:37,500 --> 01:57:40,140
Fine, your fucking spot is crazy.

3423
01:57:42,500 --> 01:57:44,700
Oh my god, yellow team had everybody alive.

3424
01:57:45,820 --> 01:57:47,980
Yellow team, everybody was alive.

3425
01:57:48,800 --> 01:57:50,260
Let's see if we can find some shit.

3426
01:57:53,860 --> 01:57:55,240
I don't like any side.

3427
01:57:55,300 --> 01:57:56,740
I don't like at all.

3428
01:57:56,900 --> 01:57:58,960
I'm gonna go west and then left.

3429
01:57:59,080 --> 01:58:01,940
I'm gonna hide with Thunder Person and fuck them over.

3430
01:58:03,580 --> 01:58:04,840
I believe in west and then left.

3431
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:07,560
What the fuck is this?

3432
01:58:07,740 --> 01:58:08,460
Oh no.

3433
01:58:09,760 --> 01:58:12,280
Skibity toilets, but they are aware.

3434
01:58:14,260 --> 01:58:15,140
Oh no.

3435
01:58:15,680 --> 01:58:17,460
For the culture, we have to, I feel like.

3436
01:58:17,720 --> 01:58:19,480
The actual Skibity toilets?

3437
01:58:19,740 --> 01:58:21,400
For the culture, we have to, I feel like.

3438
01:58:21,460 --> 01:58:22,820
What the fuck is my spot?

3439
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:23,820
Jesus Christ.

3440
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:26,820
This is crazy parkour needed to get here.

3441
01:58:26,940 --> 01:58:27,060
Hello?

3442
01:58:29,320 --> 01:58:29,780
I'm dead.

3443
01:58:30,420 --> 01:58:32,200
These guys know the spots.

3444
01:58:34,600 --> 01:58:40,100
For the culture, we're giving someone 100 points if they find us.

3445
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:42,540
100 points if we get found here.

3446
01:58:44,240 --> 01:58:46,780
A solid 5 bomb.

3447
01:58:48,780 --> 01:58:50,700
I lowkey wanna run over there.

3448
01:58:50,920 --> 01:58:51,720
I'm not gonna lie.

3449
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:54,480
I won't because I have a good spot.

3450
01:58:54,680 --> 01:58:55,640
It'd be so funny.

3451
01:58:56,400 --> 01:58:58,020
A solid 5 bomb.

3452
01:58:58,400 --> 01:58:59,900
Wait, is there two people on you?

3453
01:59:00,080 --> 01:59:00,700
Is that you?

3454
01:59:00,880 --> 01:59:04,280
I think...

3455
01:59:04,280 --> 01:59:05,400
I don't know if I'll live.

3456
01:59:05,920 --> 01:59:07,440
Wait, I'm shifting.

3457
01:59:09,020 --> 01:59:10,020
I'm perma crouch.

3458
01:59:10,020 --> 01:59:11,640
You're 1.5 blocks in this hole.

3459
01:59:11,720 --> 01:59:12,500
I'm perma crouch.

3460
01:59:12,880 --> 01:59:14,620
Oh shit, wait.

3461
01:59:15,420 --> 01:59:17,500
You have another lick teammate there.

3462
01:59:17,660 --> 01:59:19,180
Do I?

3463
01:59:19,280 --> 01:59:19,820
I don't think I do.

3464
01:59:20,080 --> 01:59:20,600
I think so.

3465
01:59:22,760 --> 01:59:24,280
Maybe it's lick perspective.

3466
01:59:24,700 --> 01:59:24,840
No!

3467
01:59:25,660 --> 01:59:26,360
He found me!

3468
01:59:26,740 --> 01:59:27,640
He turned around!

3469
01:59:29,760 --> 01:59:31,100
This team doesn't know!

3470
01:59:31,660 --> 01:59:32,660
This team didn't know!

3471
01:59:32,740 --> 01:59:34,980
He's getting toilet spots!

3472
01:59:36,060 --> 01:59:38,180
This motherfucker was at the top of the...

3473
01:59:38,180 --> 01:59:39,440
How is he so high?

3474
01:59:41,380 --> 01:59:43,040
Oh my god, wait.

3475
01:59:43,880 --> 01:59:45,560
There's another skippity toilet.

3476
01:59:45,860 --> 01:59:47,780
How is there so many people in here?

3477
01:59:49,160 --> 01:59:52,520
If someone came into skippity toilet room and found this spot...

3478
01:59:52,520 --> 01:59:53,140
No, no, no.

3479
01:59:53,160 --> 01:59:56,120
There is someone else in your room from our team.

3480
01:59:56,220 --> 01:59:57,340
There's so many people in there!

3481
01:59:59,020 --> 01:59:59,600
I think it was gooby.

3482
01:59:59,860 --> 02:00:00,780
Gooby was at the bottom.

3483
02:00:00,960 --> 02:00:01,960
I was in there, yeah.

3484
02:00:03,540 --> 02:00:05,460
It was just bugging on my spectate.

3485
02:00:05,460 --> 02:00:05,900
Okay, wait, wait.

3486
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:06,500
Fine, fine, fine.

3487
02:00:06,580 --> 02:00:07,220
Follow me, follow me.

3488
02:00:07,300 --> 02:00:07,840
Come east.

3489
02:00:08,280 --> 02:00:09,260
Trust, I have a spot.

3490
02:00:09,540 --> 02:00:10,040
It's insane.

3491
02:00:11,680 --> 02:00:13,220
This spot is crazy.

3492
02:00:13,580 --> 02:00:14,580
We all die.

3493
02:00:16,060 --> 02:00:16,980
It's funny, it's funny.

3494
02:00:17,240 --> 02:00:18,840
It's on top of the hill, right?

3495
02:00:19,180 --> 02:00:20,220
No, it's on top here.

3496
02:00:20,760 --> 02:00:21,280
Go in.

3497
02:00:21,680 --> 02:00:25,120
In this fucking pipe, there's like a trap door that you can stand on.

3498
02:00:25,340 --> 02:00:26,700
And you're just hidden.

3499
02:00:27,540 --> 02:00:28,200
It's crazy.

3500
02:00:28,500 --> 02:00:30,140
Lower trap door, lower trap door.

3501
02:00:31,180 --> 02:00:31,780
It's hidden.

3502
02:00:31,780 --> 02:00:33,680
You have to walk one lower.

3503
02:00:33,760 --> 02:00:34,700
You can fall one lower.

3504
02:00:35,760 --> 02:00:37,560
It's in the back, it's in the back.

3505
02:00:37,640 --> 02:00:39,680
This side, this side of the back.

3506
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:41,660
Stop trying to get in, though.

3507
02:00:42,080 --> 02:00:42,860
Because they'll see us.

3508
02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:45,840
Just stay still, just stay still.

3509
02:00:45,960 --> 02:00:46,780
No, they haven't.

3510
02:00:46,840 --> 02:00:47,660
They have not spotted us.

3511
02:00:47,940 --> 02:00:48,700
No, he's not going to look in here.

3512
02:00:50,580 --> 02:00:52,260
They saw me, they saw me, though.

3513
02:00:52,400 --> 02:00:53,420
They saw me, though.

3514
02:00:53,560 --> 02:00:55,040
OG Skidding Toilet of Ra.

3515
02:00:55,940 --> 02:00:56,660
Chapter 2.

3516
02:00:57,820 --> 02:00:59,420
This is lower expanded.

3517
02:00:59,420 --> 02:01:01,820
Chapter 2 Skidding.

3518
02:01:02,240 --> 02:01:04,460
And it's looking so good.

3519
02:01:05,520 --> 02:01:06,700
It's insane.

3520
02:01:08,240 --> 02:01:10,580
Wait, wait, wait.

3521
02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:11,860
I'm alive?

3522
02:01:12,020 --> 02:01:12,580
How many of us are here?

3523
02:01:12,760 --> 02:01:13,680
I got away?

3524
02:01:14,320 --> 02:01:15,860
I got away?

3525
02:01:16,640 --> 02:01:19,620
I just see you guys highlighted up in the Skidding Toilet.

3526
02:01:19,640 --> 02:01:20,480
I'll have to get a clip of that.

3527
02:01:21,080 --> 02:01:22,080
Oh my god.

3528
02:01:22,720 --> 02:01:24,140
Shane keeps dying.

3529
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:26,860
It's just unfortunate for some people.

3530
02:01:26,860 --> 02:01:28,500
I got away?

3531
02:01:35,410 --> 02:01:36,230
Gamers don't look up, though.

3532
02:01:36,270 --> 02:01:36,790
They don't check.

3533
02:01:37,290 --> 02:01:38,630
Look, he's not going to look in here.

3534
02:01:39,510 --> 02:01:41,250
If you look up, then you have to look down.

3535
02:01:41,370 --> 02:01:44,390
And when you're in the room, everyone's like, you have to check Skibbity, you have to check Skibbity.

3536
02:01:46,470 --> 02:01:47,930
Look at them checking Skibbity.

3537
02:01:48,150 --> 02:01:48,810
What noobs.

3538
02:01:49,190 --> 02:01:49,870
What noobs.

3539
02:01:52,690 --> 02:01:53,850
Someone was actually up there.

3540
02:01:55,090 --> 02:01:55,870
They won't look.

3541
02:01:57,850 --> 02:01:59,670
You guys are so safe where you are.

3542
02:01:59,670 --> 02:02:01,230
This is chilling.

3543
02:02:01,730 --> 02:02:03,070
Are we all surviving?

3544
02:02:04,970 --> 02:02:06,550
I'm so sorry.

3545
02:02:07,050 --> 02:02:08,610
We did, man.

3546
02:02:08,870 --> 02:02:09,790
That is my bad.

3547
02:02:10,370 --> 02:02:13,270
This team works on their fucking searching.

3548
02:02:13,430 --> 02:02:19,810
I had the greatest escape, and then we all go to survive?

3549
02:02:20,270 --> 02:02:20,890
Oh man.

3550
02:02:20,970 --> 02:02:22,430
We pretty much tied first.

3551
02:02:22,710 --> 02:02:24,270
The blink gap is nothing.

3552
02:02:24,830 --> 02:02:25,890
Oh my god.

3553
02:02:25,890 --> 02:02:26,790
Oh my god.

3554
02:02:27,770 --> 02:02:30,230
This game is so good, man.

3555
02:02:30,410 --> 02:02:31,250
I love BlizzCon.

3556
02:02:31,670 --> 02:02:35,410
Okay, now every game now is a multiplier, by the way.

3557
02:02:36,490 --> 02:02:38,250
It's like small multiplier first.

3558
02:02:38,470 --> 02:02:39,530
It's a 1-7?

3559
02:02:40,290 --> 02:02:41,370
Maybe 1-6.

3560
02:02:45,250 --> 02:02:47,030
500 points for BlizzCon.

3561
02:02:48,350 --> 02:02:49,510
It's a skill-based game, man.

3562
02:02:49,610 --> 02:02:51,350
I love gaming.

3563
02:02:51,990 --> 02:02:53,450
It's just a skill-based game.

3564
02:02:53,450 --> 02:02:56,030
We are exactly a thousand points ahead from second.

3565
02:02:56,150 --> 02:02:56,550
That's crazy.

3566
02:02:58,010 --> 02:02:58,810
I can't believe it.

3567
02:02:58,810 --> 02:03:00,430
I didn't see the room with the garage in it.

3568
02:03:00,450 --> 02:03:03,950
There's this one room where you can go into the garage and like get up in the back somehow?

3569
02:03:04,130 --> 02:03:05,010
I didn't see it once.

3570
02:03:05,810 --> 02:03:06,550
I wonder if it's still in there.

3571
02:03:07,370 --> 02:03:11,290
I just had like the greatest escape just to get fucked over by the caster curse.

3572
02:03:12,770 --> 02:03:13,650
My bad, guys.

3573
02:03:15,550 --> 02:03:16,710
Oh, Wolfie, holy brother.

3574
02:03:17,310 --> 02:03:19,230
The gap on this leaderboard is something.

3575
02:03:19,230 --> 02:03:21,230
Oh, wow.

3576
02:03:21,870 --> 02:03:22,470
Holy brother.

3577
02:03:24,290 --> 02:03:27,510
Shane probably genuinely got 150 points.

3578
02:03:28,530 --> 02:03:30,410
Wait, but there's a multiplier now, though.

3579
02:03:30,410 --> 02:03:31,890
It felt way worse, I'm gonna be honest.

3580
02:03:32,230 --> 02:03:33,330
Oh, I ranked up!

3581
02:03:34,070 --> 02:03:34,870
Let's go!

3582
02:03:36,710 --> 02:03:37,770
I'm 18th now.

3583
02:03:37,850 --> 02:03:39,710
Alright, guys, look at all the Minecrafters I'm better.

3584
02:03:41,830 --> 02:03:42,270
Damn.

3585
02:03:44,830 --> 02:03:45,170
Wow.

3586
02:03:46,230 --> 02:03:47,030
Look at these guys.

3587
02:03:47,030 --> 02:03:51,750
I'm a laughing fire breath man by exactly one tiny point.

3588
02:03:53,530 --> 02:03:54,630
Should've been better at the game.

3589
02:03:55,950 --> 02:03:57,730
Hey, man, one point's a pretty big gap, dude.

3590
02:03:58,310 --> 02:04:00,830
I mean, he's gonna beat my ass in race, so that's when it's over.

3591
02:04:01,370 --> 02:04:02,190
That's the one point?

3592
02:04:02,910 --> 02:04:05,590
I mean, that's gonna be more than one point, probably, but like, you know.

3593
02:04:07,350 --> 02:04:08,870
Today could be your day, who knows?

3594
02:04:09,150 --> 02:04:14,390
Last time we pretty much tied, because EU ping diff, you know, makes up for the one tick difference.

3595
02:04:14,390 --> 02:04:16,630
The one tick.

3596
02:04:17,190 --> 02:04:18,230
Literally one tick.

3597
02:04:18,470 --> 02:04:19,490
He beat me by one tick.

3598
02:04:20,750 --> 02:04:21,470
That's crazy.

3599
02:04:22,930 --> 02:04:24,850
So, EU ping diff makes up for it.

3600
02:04:24,890 --> 02:04:25,790
I technically beat your ass.

3601
02:04:25,910 --> 02:04:26,390
That's how it works.

3602
02:04:28,030 --> 02:04:29,290
We're just playing party last.

3603
02:04:29,770 --> 02:04:31,410
I'm mentally invested in playing party last.

3604
02:04:31,610 --> 02:04:32,010
I'm down for that.

3605
02:04:32,470 --> 02:04:33,190
Party seems really fun, too.

3606
02:04:33,190 --> 02:04:36,050
It's risky, because we don't know half the games, but I guess everyone doesn't know half the games.

3607
02:04:36,210 --> 02:04:37,750
Yeah, like no one does in this.

3608
02:04:38,730 --> 02:04:40,230
We don't know, they don't know.

3609
02:04:40,370 --> 02:04:41,750
And I absolutely do not know.

3610
02:04:41,750 --> 02:04:42,910
Mm-hmm.

3611
02:04:44,030 --> 02:04:46,030
Whoa, how'd that person have a boat?

3612
02:04:46,770 --> 02:04:47,190
Wait, where?

3613
02:04:47,470 --> 02:04:49,110
Click on the ice.

3614
02:04:49,390 --> 02:04:49,530
Can?

3615
02:04:50,970 --> 02:04:51,370
Where?

3616
02:04:53,370 --> 02:04:55,250
Just all on the outside of the hub.

3617
02:04:55,410 --> 02:04:56,170
You can just click on the ice.

3618
02:04:56,970 --> 02:04:57,270
Oh!

3619
02:04:59,950 --> 02:05:03,310
Is there like an invisible wall we can't go past a certain area?

3620
02:05:03,630 --> 02:05:05,250
No, you'll just fall off and it'll keep you back.

3621
02:05:05,550 --> 02:05:06,210
Oh, okay.

3622
02:05:06,430 --> 02:05:07,730
You can just boat off if you wanted to.

3623
02:05:07,990 --> 02:05:09,830
Oh, I couldn't even boat off.

3624
02:05:09,830 --> 02:05:13,230
Okay, uh... I mean, I say we go race, but I don't think it matters.

3625
02:05:13,470 --> 02:05:14,310
No, man!

3626
02:05:14,490 --> 02:05:15,550
Oh my god, my heart.

3627
02:05:15,830 --> 02:05:16,710
I glanced off.

3628
02:05:17,350 --> 02:05:18,910
I read extraction as construction.

3629
02:05:19,450 --> 02:05:22,430
So, like, we can have less multiplier when we do it now, right?

3630
02:05:22,670 --> 02:05:22,770
Oh my god.

3631
02:05:22,990 --> 02:05:24,470
I only see extraction.

3632
02:05:24,830 --> 02:05:25,930
I only see one sign.

3633
02:05:26,130 --> 02:05:26,730
That's my cat.

3634
02:05:26,810 --> 02:05:27,890
Why is it named Feinberg?

3635
02:05:29,170 --> 02:05:29,830
Why is my cat...

3636
02:05:31,110 --> 02:05:31,830
It's construction!

3637
02:05:32,650 --> 02:05:34,290
This is supposed to be my cat.

3638
02:05:34,930 --> 02:05:37,810
Oh, it's because you're dead, so I, like, reborn you as a cat.

3639
02:05:40,990 --> 02:05:42,930
Where are my cats going?

3640
02:05:43,050 --> 02:05:44,150
Oh, my cat got reborn.

3641
02:05:45,250 --> 02:05:46,410
Vote for race.

3642
02:05:46,550 --> 02:05:46,830
Vote for race.

3643
02:05:46,850 --> 02:05:47,790
I think it is going to be race.

3644
02:05:48,010 --> 02:05:49,830
Yeah, it looks like it's going to be race right now.

3645
02:05:49,990 --> 02:05:51,570
I don't even have any signs.

3646
02:05:51,850 --> 02:05:52,550
Yeah, it's race.

3647
02:05:55,230 --> 02:05:56,450
Alright, there we go.

3648
02:05:56,670 --> 02:05:57,890
What the...

3649
02:05:57,890 --> 02:05:58,490
Ouch!

3650
02:05:59,390 --> 02:06:00,690
Race time, race time.

3651
02:06:01,450 --> 02:06:03,510
Bruh, they love extraction late.

3652
02:06:03,630 --> 02:06:04,970
It's always, like...

3653
02:06:04,970 --> 02:06:07,130
It's just a really good game to them.

3654
02:06:07,130 --> 02:06:08,290
I guess, yeah.

3655
02:06:08,430 --> 02:06:09,010
Honestly, yeah.

3656
02:06:09,790 --> 02:06:11,410
I don't know how good we'll be at it.

3657
02:06:11,470 --> 02:06:13,770
Okay, how do you play this?

3658
02:06:14,510 --> 02:06:15,210
It's a race.

3659
02:06:16,750 --> 02:06:17,550
You run...

3660
02:06:17,550 --> 02:06:20,350
It'll explain, like, the different movement things.

3661
02:06:20,390 --> 02:06:21,390
Like the jump pads and stuff.

3662
02:06:22,070 --> 02:06:22,450
Yeah.

3663
02:06:22,670 --> 02:06:24,050
With a little guy on the screen.

3664
02:06:26,070 --> 02:06:28,010
It's going to be the sickest video you've ever seen.

3665
02:06:28,570 --> 02:06:29,730
I'm not going to throw the trident section.

3666
02:06:30,250 --> 02:06:30,970
It's not going to happen.

3667
02:06:31,770 --> 02:06:32,570
Easy pad, hard pad.

3668
02:06:32,570 --> 02:06:36,590
If I go 1 for 3 on the tridents, it's better than last race.

3669
02:06:36,830 --> 02:06:37,190
Tridents?

3670
02:06:38,630 --> 02:06:39,050
Oh.

3671
02:06:40,470 --> 02:06:41,030
Yeah.

3672
02:06:42,670 --> 02:06:43,390
That's okay.

3673
02:06:44,190 --> 02:06:44,750
Tridents.

3674
02:06:46,170 --> 02:06:47,290
All good.

3675
02:06:47,710 --> 02:06:49,970
Do your best.

3676
02:06:50,490 --> 02:06:51,430
This is the jump pad.

3677
02:06:52,250 --> 02:06:53,550
And then this is the launch pad.

3678
02:06:53,750 --> 02:06:55,030
Jump pad goes straight up.

3679
02:06:55,970 --> 02:06:57,870
The green pads go straight up.

3680
02:06:57,990 --> 02:07:00,290
The red pads go, like, diagonal up, forward.

3681
02:07:00,290 --> 02:07:02,330
And then the pink pads is just running.

3682
02:07:02,450 --> 02:07:03,310
You don't want to jump on those.

3683
02:07:03,910 --> 02:07:06,150
Wait, so which pads are jump again?

3684
02:07:06,770 --> 02:07:08,650
The red and the green big ones are jump.

3685
02:07:08,690 --> 02:07:09,650
The pink ones are not.

3686
02:07:09,670 --> 02:07:11,670
Green, jump, red, far forward.

3687
02:07:12,450 --> 02:07:14,830
Red and green, you want the space bar on pink.

3688
02:07:14,890 --> 02:07:15,090
Okay.

3689
02:07:15,290 --> 02:07:16,250
Red, green, jump.

3690
02:07:16,390 --> 02:07:17,250
Red, green, jump.

3691
02:07:17,390 --> 02:07:17,590
Okay.

3692
02:07:17,770 --> 02:07:20,530
Trident, be in water, hold right click, and then let go.

3693
02:07:20,610 --> 02:07:21,110
And you'll launch.

3694
02:07:21,270 --> 02:07:21,550
Okay.

3695
02:07:22,750 --> 02:07:23,130
Understood.

3696
02:07:23,950 --> 02:07:25,290
Oh, it's banger song time.

3697
02:07:25,450 --> 02:07:25,590
Hold on.

3698
02:07:25,710 --> 02:07:26,150
I love this song.

3699
02:07:26,150 --> 02:07:26,590
Wow.

3700
02:07:27,310 --> 02:07:28,830
This shit gets me locked in.

3701
02:07:29,210 --> 02:07:29,430
Oh.

3702
02:07:31,370 --> 02:07:32,090
I'm ready.

3703
02:07:32,490 --> 02:07:35,110
You want to, like, sprint jump when you don't have speed.

3704
02:07:35,710 --> 02:07:37,670
Wait, where did everybody go?

3705
02:07:38,730 --> 02:07:40,450
Everyone's invisible, so you can actually see what you're doing.

3706
02:07:40,590 --> 02:07:41,030
Oh my god.

3707
02:07:42,610 --> 02:07:45,850
I walked back because I got so confused.

3708
02:07:46,450 --> 02:07:47,470
It's already over.

3709
02:07:47,850 --> 02:07:48,630
It's already over.

3710
02:07:48,790 --> 02:07:50,270
I missed the elytra hole.

3711
02:07:50,510 --> 02:07:50,990
It's over.

3712
02:07:51,130 --> 02:07:53,210
I didn't realize.

3713
02:07:53,210 --> 02:07:55,150
I missed the elytra.

3714
02:07:55,510 --> 02:07:59,550
I didn't realize everybody's invisible, so I walked back.

3715
02:08:00,170 --> 02:08:01,170
Oh no.

3716
02:08:01,510 --> 02:08:03,590
I was like, did I walk the wrong way?

3717
02:08:08,950 --> 02:08:09,470
Okay.

3718
02:08:10,190 --> 02:08:10,990
Ice boat time.

3719
02:08:13,210 --> 02:08:14,170
Or maybe not.

3720
02:08:14,450 --> 02:08:14,670
Oh god.

3721
02:08:14,670 --> 02:08:15,810
Oh Shane, good ice building, man.

3722
02:08:15,870 --> 02:08:16,870
Looks like you're in second now.

3723
02:08:18,250 --> 02:08:19,090
That's crazy.

3724
02:08:22,430 --> 02:08:23,570
That's the boat labs, brother.

3725
02:08:24,690 --> 02:08:25,010
Oh god.

3726
02:08:25,370 --> 02:08:28,550
Oh my god, I'm so...

3727
02:08:28,550 --> 02:08:29,630
Oh, I'm fumbling.

3728
02:08:29,770 --> 02:08:30,630
Fumble Nation is back.

3729
02:08:31,190 --> 02:08:32,690
I'm playing for, like, 15th right now.

3730
02:08:32,790 --> 02:08:33,890
That's the direction you're looking.

3731
02:08:35,070 --> 02:08:36,710
The boat is fucking me up, guys.

3732
02:08:39,550 --> 02:08:43,530
I don't think I'm a boat person, I realize.

3733
02:08:47,130 --> 02:08:47,650
What?

3734
02:08:51,790 --> 02:08:52,830
So over for me.

3735
02:08:52,830 --> 02:08:53,970
Okay, Skiff Nation is back.

3736
02:08:55,010 --> 02:08:57,710
I can't believe I'm in 10th after all the fumbling I just did.

3737
02:08:57,770 --> 02:08:58,190
That's crazy.

3738
02:08:59,350 --> 02:09:00,210
That's insane.

3739
02:09:00,850 --> 02:09:01,370
Hold on.

3740
02:09:02,350 --> 02:09:03,990
Guys, I'm not last, guys.

3741
02:09:04,650 --> 02:09:06,070
I'm only in 7th.

3742
02:09:07,170 --> 02:09:07,690
Bigger.

3743
02:09:07,990 --> 02:09:09,030
Huge, actually.

3744
02:09:09,210 --> 02:09:09,550
Larger.

3745
02:09:14,070 --> 02:09:15,850
Especially everything I went through.

3746
02:09:15,850 --> 02:09:17,330
Oh my god, we both fumbled the ice boat.

3747
02:09:18,210 --> 02:09:19,010
Or it's just weird.

3748
02:09:19,410 --> 02:09:20,090
You know, it's just weird.

3749
02:09:21,350 --> 02:09:22,090
Oh, fuck.

3750
02:09:22,450 --> 02:09:24,130
I fumbled the beginning and I'll never recover.

3751
02:09:24,670 --> 02:09:25,490
It's so sad.

3752
02:09:27,510 --> 02:09:28,550
Oh, that's what you do.

3753
02:09:29,430 --> 02:09:31,650
I'm, like, learning this race as I go along.

3754
02:09:32,230 --> 02:09:32,530
Yeah.

3755
02:09:35,590 --> 02:09:37,850
I'm surprised I'm even, like...

3756
02:09:39,750 --> 02:09:40,630
in this...

3757
02:09:41,370 --> 02:09:42,290
You got this.

3758
02:09:42,330 --> 02:09:42,870
You win these.

3759
02:09:47,250 --> 02:09:47,890
Oh my...

3760
02:09:47,890 --> 02:09:48,330
glob.

3761
02:09:49,010 --> 02:09:51,010
I think you and Shane are very far ahead, fine.

3762
02:09:51,150 --> 02:09:52,170
Because I'm with the whole squad.

3763
02:09:52,250 --> 02:09:54,030
No, Kevin's on 3rd.

3764
02:09:54,910 --> 02:09:56,410
Is Jojo close to you in 4th, though?

3765
02:09:57,090 --> 02:09:58,330
Yeah, I'm fairly sure.

3766
02:09:58,450 --> 02:09:59,590
I've seen Jojo around a lot.

3767
02:09:59,950 --> 02:10:02,630
There's literally a group of, like, 5 all together here.

3768
02:10:03,290 --> 02:10:04,190
Yeah, I'm, like, 10th.

3769
02:10:04,310 --> 02:10:05,690
Shane and Kevin are kind of far ahead.

3770
02:10:06,110 --> 02:10:06,490
Yeah, yeah.

3771
02:10:08,690 --> 02:10:09,290
Wait, what?

3772
02:10:09,330 --> 02:10:11,870
We have, like, actually a group of 5 just chilling in ice boats right now.

3773
02:10:12,490 --> 02:10:13,390
Okay, okay.

3774
02:10:15,270 --> 02:10:16,070
Yay, 37th!

3775
02:10:16,070 --> 02:10:16,530
Let's go!

3776
02:10:19,230 --> 02:10:20,290
No loss, no loss.

3777
02:10:20,370 --> 02:10:20,530
GG.

3778
02:10:21,790 --> 02:10:22,590
Wait, what?

3779
02:10:24,110 --> 02:10:25,690
Oh, I don't know how to do this section.

3780
02:10:27,370 --> 02:10:28,950
Dude, the Neo's so fucking weird.

3781
02:10:29,070 --> 02:10:29,590
Why do I...

3782
02:10:29,590 --> 02:10:30,430
I have no confidence.

3783
02:10:32,590 --> 02:10:33,050
Oh, lucky bro.

3784
02:10:33,430 --> 02:10:36,070
Oh, I saw Xshatter faceplant into a wall.

3785
02:10:36,190 --> 02:10:36,750
Unlucky, bro.

3786
02:10:38,010 --> 02:10:38,670
Oh, cam man.

3787
02:10:39,090 --> 02:10:39,370
Oh, cam man.

3788
02:10:39,370 --> 02:10:40,830
Oh my god, I inventory jammed.

3789
02:10:40,870 --> 02:10:42,030
My trident didn't work there.

3790
02:10:42,610 --> 02:10:43,470
Oh, he doesn't know how to skip.

3791
02:10:43,690 --> 02:10:43,950
Wait, GG.

3792
02:10:44,670 --> 02:10:45,530
Oh, you win these.

3793
02:10:48,330 --> 02:10:49,170
Oh my god.

3794
02:10:52,210 --> 02:10:52,890
Wait, what?

3795
02:10:54,670 --> 02:10:55,910
Wait, how do I get back up?

3796
02:10:56,490 --> 02:10:57,670
Shane's gonna be so...

3797
02:10:57,670 --> 02:10:58,810
Wait, where are you?

3798
02:10:59,610 --> 02:11:00,010
What?

3799
02:11:00,210 --> 02:11:00,690
I'm stuck.

3800
02:11:00,730 --> 02:11:01,550
You're so ahead.

3801
02:11:01,630 --> 02:11:02,030
I hate this.

3802
02:11:02,350 --> 02:11:07,470
If you're stuck, you can use the 9th inventory button and it should TP you back to your last record.

3803
02:11:07,470 --> 02:11:07,950
Wait, what?

3804
02:11:09,030 --> 02:11:12,430
Dude, same shit with the trident I just did, man.

3805
02:11:12,590 --> 02:11:12,890
What?

3806
02:11:13,810 --> 02:11:14,770
I'm a troll, man.

3807
02:11:15,130 --> 02:11:15,930
Okay, guys.

3808
02:11:17,010 --> 02:11:18,410
I am not doing this.

3809
02:11:19,730 --> 02:11:21,790
Guys, I'm like stuck here.

3810
02:11:22,530 --> 02:11:23,310
No, you got this.

3811
02:11:23,730 --> 02:11:26,850
I'm stuck in this water area because I'm confused.

3812
02:11:27,130 --> 02:11:27,690
Oh my god, cam man.

3813
02:11:27,750 --> 02:11:28,050
Nice try.

3814
02:11:29,310 --> 02:11:30,530
Hey, we're fighting for second here, man.

3815
02:11:31,530 --> 02:11:35,690
I'm like fighting for like range of 4th to 10th.

3816
02:11:35,690 --> 02:11:36,130
I don't know.

3817
02:11:36,410 --> 02:11:37,030
That's big.

3818
02:11:37,090 --> 02:11:38,430
That's big points if you clutch it.

3819
02:11:38,950 --> 02:11:40,850
I'm not clutching it, but I'm trying.

3820
02:11:41,010 --> 02:11:42,330
You can clutch it.

3821
02:11:43,650 --> 02:11:44,830
I'm stuck forever.

3822
02:11:46,050 --> 02:11:47,710
Oh, and Fumble Nation applied.

3823
02:11:48,530 --> 02:11:48,990
Like, what?

3824
02:11:48,990 --> 02:11:49,770
Applications accepted.

3825
02:11:49,910 --> 02:11:50,450
I got in.

3826
02:11:51,310 --> 02:11:52,110
Oh my god.

3827
02:11:52,550 --> 02:11:54,210
You passed?

3828
02:11:54,550 --> 02:11:57,770
I was just overqualified, honestly.

3829
02:11:58,410 --> 02:12:00,130
I was overqualified from Fumble Nation.

3830
02:12:00,690 --> 02:12:01,490
This was hell.

3831
02:12:01,890 --> 02:12:03,210
I was stuck in hell right there.

3832
02:12:03,210 --> 02:12:06,090
I figured it out.

3833
02:12:06,150 --> 02:12:08,150
I figured out what I did wrong.

3834
02:12:08,690 --> 02:12:09,210
Huge.

3835
02:12:09,490 --> 02:12:10,450
You fought through it.

3836
02:12:11,970 --> 02:12:13,990
I fought through the pain.

3837
02:12:17,890 --> 02:12:20,310
Who am I even...

3838
02:12:20,310 --> 02:12:21,290
Who is in front of me?

3839
02:12:21,390 --> 02:12:22,210
I think that's Jojo.

3840
02:12:22,610 --> 02:12:23,390
I fell.

3841
02:12:23,690 --> 02:12:24,010
It's over.

3842
02:12:27,010 --> 02:12:27,670
Oh my god.

3843
02:12:27,670 --> 02:12:28,070
Oh, fuck.

3844
02:12:29,490 --> 02:12:30,230
Oh, glob.

3845
02:12:30,230 --> 02:12:30,290
Oh, glob.

3846
02:12:32,330 --> 02:12:33,030
Oh, I know.

3847
02:12:33,170 --> 02:12:34,070
I got Loki, Saint, oh, glob.

3848
02:12:35,010 --> 02:12:39,150
I think, honestly, the worst part is just, I just don't know this math.

3849
02:12:40,230 --> 02:12:40,630
Yeah.

3850
02:12:42,310 --> 02:12:43,030
There's a lot.

3851
02:12:43,390 --> 02:12:46,930
Oh my god, his old ass can't keep up with me, surely.

3852
02:12:47,210 --> 02:12:47,490
Come on.

3853
02:12:48,410 --> 02:12:50,130
Goddamn, she's so fucking fast.

3854
02:12:51,990 --> 02:12:52,850
Back here, bitch.

3855
02:12:53,050 --> 02:12:53,130
Come on.

3856
02:12:53,130 --> 02:12:54,750
As long as I'm not last, everybody.

3857
02:12:55,570 --> 02:12:56,450
That's all that matters.

3858
02:13:00,490 --> 02:13:01,890
Oh, I miss my jumps.

3859
02:13:02,030 --> 02:13:02,250
Okay.

3860
02:13:04,310 --> 02:13:05,390
Hey, guys.

3861
02:13:06,830 --> 02:13:07,750
I'm 38th.

3862
02:13:07,750 --> 02:13:08,450
Let's go.

3863
02:13:09,270 --> 02:13:10,170
You got that?

3864
02:13:10,310 --> 02:13:11,270
38th in style, though.

3865
02:13:11,850 --> 02:13:12,310
Exactly.

3866
02:13:13,610 --> 02:13:14,430
Oh my god.

3867
02:13:15,630 --> 02:13:16,750
Nah, he beats my ass.

3868
02:13:16,810 --> 02:13:17,050
Unlucky.

3869
02:13:17,270 --> 02:13:17,970
It's chill.

3870
02:13:20,410 --> 02:13:21,170
We take that.

3871
02:13:28,110 --> 02:13:31,270
My last lap was a 9 second improvement.

3872
02:13:31,590 --> 02:13:35,110
Oh my god, that just shows how much I was eating dirt in the beginning.

3873
02:13:35,570 --> 02:13:37,190
That's actually a huge difference.

3874
02:13:37,650 --> 02:13:38,670
Yeah, that's crazy.

3875
02:13:41,610 --> 02:13:41,930
God.

3876
02:13:44,150 --> 02:13:45,690
We locked it down here.

3877
02:13:45,810 --> 02:13:46,550
We locked it down.

3878
02:13:46,990 --> 02:13:48,070
Back at it, Akko.

3879
02:13:49,350 --> 02:13:52,410
I think I see... Oh, Doki Bird coming in clutch.

3880
02:13:52,750 --> 02:13:53,930
I'm heading back.

3881
02:13:54,010 --> 02:13:54,950
I'm still on my...

3882
02:13:54,950 --> 02:13:57,090
I don't even know how many laps I have left.

3883
02:13:58,110 --> 02:13:59,030
Okay, that's lap 2.

3884
02:13:59,170 --> 02:13:59,970
That's all good.

3885
02:14:00,130 --> 02:14:00,430
You got it.

3886
02:14:00,430 --> 02:14:02,110
There's somebody who hasn't done a lap.

3887
02:14:02,330 --> 02:14:03,370
No, you have one more lap.

3888
02:14:04,090 --> 02:14:04,750
Oh, okay.

3889
02:14:09,130 --> 02:14:10,670
Someone hasn't finished a lap.

3890
02:14:10,970 --> 02:14:12,030
I don't know who it is.

3891
02:14:12,430 --> 02:14:13,450
I think I might know.

3892
02:14:13,590 --> 02:14:14,390
I don't know.

3893
02:14:17,230 --> 02:14:18,390
Where did I just TP to?

3894
02:14:19,510 --> 02:14:20,870
Okay, I think it's Toma.

3895
02:14:22,150 --> 02:14:23,330
Toma got 39th.

3896
02:14:26,770 --> 02:14:28,530
Oh, wait, did Toma get 39th?

3897
02:14:29,130 --> 02:14:29,930
It's Toms.

3898
02:14:30,870 --> 02:14:33,470
Yeah, I think it's Toms.

3899
02:14:34,010 --> 02:14:37,970
Toms is currently hanging out in the water.

3900
02:14:38,690 --> 02:14:39,190
Oh no.

3901
02:14:40,530 --> 02:14:41,730
It's unfortunate.

3902
02:14:43,210 --> 02:14:44,630
There's Rev going through.

3903
02:14:47,070 --> 02:14:48,970
I've locked in for 31st.

3904
02:14:49,230 --> 02:14:49,910
Oh my god.

3905
02:14:50,850 --> 02:14:51,390
Oh my god.

3906
02:14:51,510 --> 02:14:52,710
You know what we should do, actually?

3907
02:14:53,890 --> 02:14:56,730
I hate the boat so much.

3908
02:14:58,830 --> 02:15:00,890
I mean, this is unfortunate.

3909
02:15:01,070 --> 02:15:01,710
This is pretty bad.

3910
02:15:03,250 --> 02:15:14,470
But it probably wouldn't hurt because the event is trending lower comp to have like a... you know how PD Voidbound lets you just run it for 30 seconds as a practice?

3911
02:15:14,670 --> 02:15:18,290
You should just do that with Trident and the boost pad.

3912
02:15:18,470 --> 02:15:19,570
Just some runaround thing.

3913
02:15:19,770 --> 02:15:21,670
Like how Battle lets you do the kits for a minute and a half.

3914
02:15:21,770 --> 02:15:23,130
I don't think it would hurt.

3915
02:15:25,770 --> 02:15:27,130
This would not happen.

3916
02:15:27,130 --> 02:15:27,990
Are you still watching?

3917
02:15:28,490 --> 02:15:29,550
I am watching.

3918
02:15:29,710 --> 02:15:34,770
I'm kind of curious about how the team is not telling them what to do.

3919
02:15:34,810 --> 02:15:35,390
Oh man.

3920
02:15:35,550 --> 02:15:36,830
Is Toma okay?

3921
02:15:37,990 --> 02:15:40,090
Toms is currently iceboarding.

3922
02:15:40,590 --> 02:15:41,970
Wait, I'm laughing her.

3923
02:15:45,150 --> 02:15:46,350
Get her ass.

3924
02:15:46,470 --> 02:15:46,910
Get her ass.

3925
02:15:47,610 --> 02:15:49,210
I'm sorry, Toma.

3926
02:15:49,690 --> 02:15:52,930
I'm sorry, Toma.

3927
02:15:52,950 --> 02:15:53,210
Get her.

3928
02:15:53,290 --> 02:15:53,910
Hit those stairs.

3929
02:15:53,910 --> 02:15:54,970
I'm sorry.

3930
02:15:56,250 --> 02:15:57,170
And it's okay?

3931
02:15:57,710 --> 02:15:58,650
Apparently you can.

3932
02:15:59,090 --> 02:16:01,410
They're just going for the scenic route really at this point.

3933
02:16:01,730 --> 02:16:05,010
This is a really romantic route that they're taking.

3934
02:16:05,570 --> 02:16:07,310
I think they've given up.

3935
02:16:07,470 --> 02:16:09,450
I honestly don't think Toms cares anymore.

3936
02:16:09,710 --> 02:16:13,670
I think it's fair considering this is round one.

3937
02:16:14,550 --> 02:16:15,670
Yeah, it's chill.

3938
02:16:16,390 --> 02:16:16,950
Oh man.

3939
02:16:17,270 --> 02:16:19,210
I'm right behind you.

3940
02:16:19,650 --> 02:16:21,090
Surely there's no barriers.

3941
02:16:21,090 --> 02:16:21,850
No.

3942
02:16:23,890 --> 02:16:26,410
This person doesn't know the exit boat control.

3943
02:16:26,550 --> 02:16:27,610
Oh my god, it worked and I put him up.

3944
02:16:28,390 --> 02:16:30,110
We're not having to beat them.

3945
02:16:30,750 --> 02:16:31,630
Verdict up in the air.

3946
02:16:32,730 --> 02:16:33,990
Verdict genuinely up in the air.

3947
02:16:37,030 --> 02:16:39,470
Has their team told Toms how to sprint?

3948
02:16:39,970 --> 02:16:40,590
Like, hello?

3949
02:16:40,750 --> 02:16:41,410
Oh Jesus.

3950
02:16:42,690 --> 02:16:43,670
What's going on?

3951
02:16:43,670 --> 02:16:45,430
Oh my god, they're just like Jesus right now.

3952
02:16:45,550 --> 02:16:46,350
Yeah, they're actually like Jesus.

3953
02:16:46,490 --> 02:16:47,570
They're just walking in the water.

3954
02:16:47,590 --> 02:16:47,950
Is he okay?

3955
02:16:47,950 --> 02:16:49,850
It's gotta be a visual bug.

3956
02:16:49,930 --> 02:16:50,590
It's a visual bug.

3957
02:16:50,650 --> 02:16:51,170
Oh wait, there we go.

3958
02:16:51,750 --> 02:16:52,770
Okay, okay, okay.

3959
02:16:53,590 --> 02:16:54,130
Big swing.

3960
02:16:54,610 --> 02:16:56,410
I've never been in this easy path before.

3961
02:16:57,250 --> 02:16:58,590
Yeah, I've never seen this before.

3962
02:16:58,890 --> 02:16:59,450
One ring.

3963
02:17:00,430 --> 02:17:00,910
Bang.

3964
02:17:01,190 --> 02:17:01,670
Handled.

3965
02:17:02,070 --> 02:17:03,390
Wait, what lap is he on?

3966
02:17:04,070 --> 02:17:04,430
One.

3967
02:17:05,910 --> 02:17:06,790
What happened?

3968
02:17:11,060 --> 02:17:11,840
Here's Tom.

3969
02:17:11,960 --> 02:17:12,220
Okay.

3970
02:17:13,260 --> 02:17:18,660
I think my downfall was when I got confused that everybody disappeared and I turned around and looked back.

3971
02:17:20,820 --> 02:17:21,240
Oh my god.

3972
02:17:21,300 --> 02:17:21,760
Alright, come on.

3973
02:17:21,800 --> 02:17:22,480
Let's hand it to Charlie.

3974
02:17:23,500 --> 02:17:24,160
They got this.

3975
02:17:24,180 --> 02:17:24,680
They got this.

3976
02:17:24,860 --> 02:17:26,920
They're on the wall.

3977
02:17:27,600 --> 02:17:28,340
They're on the wall.

3978
02:17:29,280 --> 02:17:30,580
Nope, they don't want to go.

3979
02:17:30,700 --> 02:17:31,060
Okay, wait.

3980
02:17:31,120 --> 02:17:31,340
Maybe?

3981
02:17:31,520 --> 02:17:31,740
Maybe?

3982
02:17:32,100 --> 02:17:33,340
And then look up, right?

3983
02:17:33,500 --> 02:17:33,940
Yeah, surely.

3984
02:17:34,620 --> 02:17:35,160
Up there.

3985
02:17:36,340 --> 02:17:36,660
Insane.

3986
02:17:37,420 --> 02:17:37,740
GG.

3987
02:17:39,160 --> 02:17:39,800
Holy moly.

3988
02:17:40,540 --> 02:17:41,940
Alright, so Tom, skip to the left.

3989
02:17:42,140 --> 02:17:42,880
Boostpad to the left.

3990
02:17:42,960 --> 02:17:44,040
Skip and then hold left.

3991
02:17:44,200 --> 02:17:44,720
3 plus 1.

3992
02:17:44,780 --> 02:17:45,620
Yeah, it's light work.

3993
02:17:45,700 --> 02:17:46,220
Just do the skip.

3994
02:17:46,320 --> 02:17:46,840
It's not easy.

3995
02:17:47,840 --> 02:17:49,120
Did someone boost my cutover?

3996
02:17:50,300 --> 02:17:51,200
Oh my god.

3997
02:17:52,700 --> 02:17:54,180
There's another boat section.

3998
02:17:54,380 --> 02:17:55,060
There's another boat section.

3999
02:17:55,240 --> 02:17:55,720
Oh no.

4000
02:17:56,140 --> 02:17:58,440
I blame Booster for this one.

4001
02:17:59,380 --> 02:18:02,820
Lowkey, I think Booster needs to do some more teamwork here.

4002
02:18:03,380 --> 02:18:03,840
Honestly.

4003
02:18:04,060 --> 02:18:05,960
Wait, what happened to him in the last boat section?

4004
02:18:07,800 --> 02:18:09,260
They spent like 7 minutes.

4005
02:18:09,600 --> 02:18:11,100
And then they fell off entirely.

4006
02:18:11,120 --> 02:18:11,340
Wait?

4007
02:18:11,540 --> 02:18:14,820
See these like 3 block barrels where your boat goes really slow?

4008
02:18:15,380 --> 02:18:16,540
Yeah, they just launched it over.

4009
02:18:16,540 --> 02:18:17,160
They're doing it though.

4010
02:18:17,180 --> 02:18:18,060
Crazy, crazy movement.

4011
02:18:18,960 --> 02:18:20,900
I fucking struggle so hard on this.

4012
02:18:21,060 --> 02:18:21,600
Oh my god.

4013
02:18:21,660 --> 02:18:21,960
Oh my god.

4014
02:18:22,020 --> 02:18:22,280
To the left.

4015
02:18:23,060 --> 02:18:24,000
You got this, Luffy.

4016
02:18:24,440 --> 02:18:26,360
You got this, Luffy.

4017
02:18:27,200 --> 02:18:27,860
Or not.

4018
02:18:27,920 --> 02:18:28,200
Or not.

4019
02:18:28,260 --> 02:18:28,540
Or not.

4020
02:18:28,600 --> 02:18:28,960
Nevermind.

4021
02:18:30,040 --> 02:18:30,480
Oh, oh.

4022
02:18:30,660 --> 02:18:31,060
Oh, oh.

4023
02:18:32,460 --> 02:18:33,340
Close enough.

4024
02:18:34,200 --> 02:18:34,700
Let's go.

4025
02:18:35,480 --> 02:18:36,840
And he did it!

4026
02:18:37,060 --> 02:18:37,160
Oh.

4027
02:18:38,240 --> 02:18:39,400
What does that mean?

4028
02:18:39,400 --> 02:18:40,420
Oh, that's what?

4029
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:45,520
This person was going through it, guys.

4030
02:18:45,600 --> 02:18:45,680
Okay?

4031
02:18:45,840 --> 02:18:46,840
This person was going through it.

4032
02:18:48,320 --> 02:18:50,160
Look at this clean Elytra though.

4033
02:18:50,180 --> 02:18:51,020
Look at this clean Elytra.

4034
02:18:51,540 --> 02:18:51,980
Damn.

4035
02:18:52,740 --> 02:18:53,920
He's on team blue, right?

4036
02:18:54,100 --> 02:18:54,360
Okay.

4037
02:18:54,520 --> 02:18:54,700
Yeah.

4038
02:18:55,500 --> 02:18:56,340
Oh shit.

4039
02:18:57,200 --> 02:18:58,080
Holy shit.

4040
02:18:58,220 --> 02:19:01,140
Team Fighters got so many points.

4041
02:19:01,500 --> 02:19:02,320
They did crazy.

4042
02:19:04,840 --> 02:19:06,520
I did not help out.

4043
02:19:06,700 --> 02:19:07,220
Not gonna lie.

4044
02:19:07,220 --> 02:19:08,320
With the points for that.

4045
02:19:11,080 --> 02:19:12,320
Is their ping bad?

4046
02:19:12,460 --> 02:19:14,320
Why did they get no jump on that pad?

4047
02:19:14,480 --> 02:19:15,040
Maybe they do.

4048
02:19:15,220 --> 02:19:15,900
I can't check.

4049
02:19:15,920 --> 02:19:16,360
Oh my god.

4050
02:19:16,480 --> 02:19:16,800
No!

4051
02:19:16,920 --> 02:19:17,480
You're gonna make it!

4052
02:19:17,480 --> 02:19:18,260
Maybe they do have bad ping.

4053
02:19:18,280 --> 02:19:19,780
You can't even let him finish!

4054
02:19:20,420 --> 02:19:21,420
You're not even gonna let this poor man finish!

4055
02:19:21,560 --> 02:19:22,820
Problems like West Coast.

4056
02:19:22,980 --> 02:19:24,600
So it shouldn't be that bad.

4057
02:19:25,180 --> 02:19:26,040
Something's not working.

4058
02:19:26,340 --> 02:19:27,900
Yeah, something's wrong with their thing.

4059
02:19:27,980 --> 02:19:28,300
I don't know.

4060
02:19:28,380 --> 02:19:28,520
Yeah.

4061
02:19:29,060 --> 02:19:30,480
Is he streaming right now?

4062
02:19:31,460 --> 02:19:34,100
Maybe if you spam jump on it, it's bad?

4063
02:19:34,200 --> 02:19:34,660
I don't know.

4064
02:19:34,660 --> 02:19:36,840
The jump pad definitely isn't working.

4065
02:19:37,040 --> 02:19:39,640
Maybe if you hold space, it's just doesn't work.

4066
02:19:39,960 --> 02:19:41,920
Let this man finish the lap!

4067
02:19:41,980 --> 02:19:43,620
He struggled so hard!

4068
02:19:44,380 --> 02:19:46,200
Big Tome of Hours, let's go!

4069
02:19:48,520 --> 02:19:49,980
Alright, Top's time.

4070
02:19:50,740 --> 02:19:51,300
Okay.

4071
02:19:52,020 --> 02:19:52,380
Uh-huh.

4072
02:19:53,400 --> 02:19:54,320
Wait, hold on.

4073
02:19:54,640 --> 02:19:54,960
Crazy.

4074
02:19:55,180 --> 02:19:55,660
Hold on.

4075
02:19:55,760 --> 02:19:56,220
No, no, no.

4076
02:19:56,220 --> 02:19:57,420
Just gotta slow down tactically.

4077
02:19:57,920 --> 02:19:59,180
Don't go too far.

4078
02:19:59,180 --> 02:20:00,080
Don't go too far.

4079
02:20:01,200 --> 02:20:04,340
Wait, does he have to climb back up?

4080
02:20:04,860 --> 02:20:08,880
Yeah, you have to, like, get to the end here and then climb all the way.

4081
02:20:09,580 --> 02:20:10,100
No!

4082
02:20:10,660 --> 02:20:11,320
Add time!

4083
02:20:11,540 --> 02:20:11,820
Add time!

4084
02:20:11,980 --> 02:20:14,660
We did not convince the admins to add time.

4085
02:20:15,160 --> 02:20:15,380
Yay.

4086
02:20:16,260 --> 02:20:20,280
That's a great response after playing one and maybe a half lap.

4087
02:20:21,620 --> 02:20:22,140
Yay.

4088
02:20:23,120 --> 02:20:24,660
Oh, we still got second?

4089
02:20:25,420 --> 02:20:26,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4090
02:20:26,400 --> 02:20:27,720
Damn, okay.

4091
02:20:27,960 --> 02:20:30,160
There you go.

4092
02:20:30,320 --> 02:20:31,580
Yeah, Shane's disgusting, man.

4093
02:20:31,680 --> 02:20:32,520
Like, what is that, bro?

4094
02:20:32,920 --> 02:20:33,500
What is that, bro?

4095
02:20:34,260 --> 02:20:35,160
I don't know.

4096
02:20:36,240 --> 02:20:36,740
Uh-oh!

4097
02:20:38,880 --> 02:20:42,400
It only shows one fastest lap per person, so it's respectful.

4098
02:20:43,080 --> 02:20:44,040
Otherwise, um...

4099
02:20:44,040 --> 02:20:47,220
My placement is definitely going to fall from that.

4100
02:20:48,760 --> 02:20:49,320
Yup!

4101
02:20:50,040 --> 02:20:53,500
17 seconds results in 28 individual points.

4102
02:20:53,500 --> 02:20:58,860
My individual leaderboard is going to get absolutely blasted.

4103
02:20:59,700 --> 02:21:03,620
We're still over a thousand ahead, which is great.

4104
02:21:03,620 --> 02:21:08,460
I mean, fighters got the points, and fighters were, like, in the bottom, so it doesn't really affect us.

4105
02:21:09,460 --> 02:21:09,980
Doki!

4106
02:21:11,440 --> 02:21:13,520
This is a competitive game.

4107
02:21:17,720 --> 02:21:20,000
It is, like...

4108
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:21,480
Second is up there, man.

4109
02:21:21,480 --> 02:21:23,080
Second is up for grabs here.

4110
02:21:24,080 --> 02:21:24,960
Okay, okay.

4111
02:21:25,440 --> 02:21:27,800
I mean, extraction could change a lot.

4112
02:21:27,980 --> 02:21:29,620
Alright, how much did that fall?

4113
02:21:30,340 --> 02:21:31,100
Oh my god.

4114
02:21:31,320 --> 02:21:33,200
I don't want to look at it anymore.

4115
02:21:34,780 --> 02:21:35,740
What I'm looking for!

4116
02:21:36,400 --> 02:21:37,160
I don't know!

4117
02:21:38,120 --> 02:21:39,320
Don't look at it!

4118
02:21:39,620 --> 02:21:41,620
Whenever we pick these back up...

4119
02:21:41,620 --> 02:21:44,980
I think I'd have to get zero points in party for this.

4120
02:21:46,440 --> 02:21:48,220
We're going to go crazy on party.

4121
02:21:48,220 --> 02:21:49,160
Alright, extraction.

4122
02:21:49,980 --> 02:21:51,220
Extraction's going to be fun too.

4123
02:21:55,380 --> 02:21:56,840
Alright, it's big gaming hours.

4124
02:21:57,860 --> 02:21:59,960
I kind of want to see an extraction right now.

4125
02:22:00,480 --> 02:22:04,620
I think party will be better at it, because it's a bunch of different stuff.

4126
02:22:05,600 --> 02:22:06,060
Party?

4127
02:22:06,580 --> 02:22:12,300
I don't like that the NPCs whip their head and turn to look at you.

4128
02:22:12,720 --> 02:22:12,960
Why?

4129
02:22:12,980 --> 02:22:16,320
Which NPC is it?

4130
02:22:16,840 --> 02:22:18,500
All the NPCs!

4131
02:22:18,700 --> 02:22:19,240
All of them?

4132
02:22:20,340 --> 02:22:21,180
Which one's the NPC?

4133
02:22:22,060 --> 02:22:22,840
They're just sassy.

4134
02:22:23,860 --> 02:22:26,800
Which one's the NPC and which one's fake?

4135
02:22:28,200 --> 02:22:30,820
The ones at the bottom of the leaderboard are the NPCs.

4136
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:32,320
And then the rest...

4137
02:22:32,940 --> 02:22:33,740
No, no, no.

4138
02:22:33,740 --> 02:22:34,840
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

4139
02:22:35,720 --> 02:22:37,220
Oh, they're like the leader!

4140
02:22:37,960 --> 02:22:38,740
To be toxic!

4141
02:22:38,740 --> 02:22:38,760
Toxic!

4142
02:22:43,440 --> 02:22:48,520
No, but the NPCs are in the theme park area.

4143
02:22:49,460 --> 02:22:50,820
Yeah, I saw some of them.

4144
02:22:50,940 --> 02:22:51,520
Oh, Wolfy's World!

4145
02:22:52,120 --> 02:22:53,640
Yeah, Wolfy World, that's what it's called.

4146
02:22:54,520 --> 02:22:56,540
By the way, I want to clarify.

4147
02:22:56,780 --> 02:22:57,880
I did not name it.

4148
02:22:58,400 --> 02:22:59,520
This is not my responsibility.

4149
02:22:59,760 --> 02:23:00,720
Sure, sure, sure.

4150
02:23:02,820 --> 02:23:03,640
That's what...

4151
02:23:04,800 --> 02:23:06,560
That's what Walt Disney would say, yeah.

4152
02:23:06,560 --> 02:23:08,440
The lore is...

4153
02:23:08,440 --> 02:23:16,720
We have a builder called Dynamite Donuts and he made an area called The Decision Donut after himself and then we went, that's kind of cringe.

4154
02:23:16,840 --> 02:23:18,180
And then he just made Wolfy World.

4155
02:23:18,420 --> 02:23:19,740
I was like, okay, I guess it's mine now.

4156
02:23:20,420 --> 02:23:21,720
What are we voting for?

4157
02:23:22,280 --> 02:23:23,340
Extraction or Party?

4158
02:23:24,200 --> 02:23:26,020
We should vote for Extraction.

4159
02:23:26,480 --> 02:23:27,520
Yeah, Extraction 100%.

4160
02:23:27,520 --> 02:23:30,320
Careful of crazy-ass bombs and shit.

4161
02:23:30,940 --> 02:23:34,000
Why haven't I got a different item than a cat this entire game?

4162
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:35,540
Hey, you got cats.

4163
02:23:35,700 --> 02:23:36,460
So many cats.

4164
02:23:37,120 --> 02:23:39,420
I'm gonna vote people off so they can't vote.

4165
02:23:42,640 --> 02:23:44,880
I'm not letting you vote.

4166
02:23:44,960 --> 02:23:47,300
I'm not gonna let you vote.

4167
02:23:47,420 --> 02:23:50,580
I'm not gonna let you vote.

4168
02:23:50,760 --> 02:23:51,060
I'm not gonna let you vote.

4169
02:23:51,160 --> 02:23:52,020
Yeah, beat them.

4170
02:23:52,980 --> 02:23:54,520
You can't vote no more.

4171
02:23:54,680 --> 02:23:56,000
You can't vote no more.

4172
02:23:56,780 --> 02:23:58,420
Get out of green.

4173
02:23:59,520 --> 02:24:00,980
Looks like we're playing Extraction.

4174
02:24:00,980 --> 02:24:01,580
I saw that.

4175
02:24:04,760 --> 02:24:05,280
Okay.

4176
02:24:07,380 --> 02:24:08,200
Good shit.

4177
02:24:08,520 --> 02:24:11,360
We're playing a map that very few people have played before.

4178
02:24:11,520 --> 02:24:12,900
Okay, so how do you play Extraction?

4179
02:24:13,260 --> 02:24:13,640
Oh yeah.

4180
02:24:14,160 --> 02:24:15,400
Extraction is crossbow.

4181
02:24:15,800 --> 02:24:19,460
You charge and then you shoot, but you can charge and run.

4182
02:24:20,160 --> 02:24:23,900
It's a 5v5 shooter game, basically.

4183
02:24:24,300 --> 02:24:25,260
It's a little arena shooter.

4184
02:24:26,120 --> 02:24:33,120
The crossbow, you have to like what we were saying, you hold right click to charge it, and then you right click again to shoot it.

4185
02:24:33,220 --> 02:24:33,900
It's not like a bow.

4186
02:24:34,020 --> 02:24:36,240
A bow, you have to hold and release and it'll shoot.

4187
02:24:36,340 --> 02:24:41,160
The crossbow, you like charge, you have to hold it to charge the arrow first.

4188
02:24:41,560 --> 02:24:44,180
And then once it's charged, you can click whenever you want.

4189
02:24:44,180 --> 02:24:46,640
Oh, okay, so you can let go after it's fully charged.

4190
02:24:47,580 --> 02:24:49,180
If you let go, it won't shoot.

4191
02:24:49,500 --> 02:24:51,460
You have to charge it and then click again.

4192
02:24:51,620 --> 02:24:53,460
Oh, so left click or right click?

4193
02:24:53,660 --> 02:24:54,020
Right click.

4194
02:24:54,920 --> 02:24:55,780
You'll figure it out.

4195
02:24:55,780 --> 02:24:57,700
You can use the first one to test it.

4196
02:24:57,920 --> 02:25:02,880
But the strategy is we're going to all go on one side of the map.

4197
02:25:03,400 --> 02:25:04,080
Every time.

4198
02:25:04,220 --> 02:25:05,440
We'll all call out which side we're going.

4199
02:25:05,600 --> 02:25:13,840
Because if this game like, if you are caught in a position where it's like a 1v3 or like a 2v4, you just lose.

4200
02:25:13,960 --> 02:25:20,140
It doesn't matter how good you are or how bad they are or whatever, you can't physically shoot more than one person at the same time.

4201
02:25:20,200 --> 02:25:22,800
Because you have to do the charge and then click again.

4202
02:25:22,940 --> 02:25:24,660
So we're just trying to overwhelm people.

4203
02:25:26,380 --> 02:25:27,660
Is the whole idea.

4204
02:25:27,820 --> 02:25:28,820
And I'll just call a side.

4205
02:25:29,120 --> 02:25:30,340
We'll go over to one of the sides.

4206
02:25:30,580 --> 02:25:33,720
We'll try to get this health up power up on the sides if you see it.

4207
02:25:36,420 --> 02:25:39,360
This health up thing on the side is just one free heart.

4208
02:25:39,500 --> 02:25:43,740
So we'll just try to have either me or Wolfie or whoever's closest try to just insta-grab it every round.

4209
02:25:44,420 --> 02:25:47,920
And then we'll just fight on whatever side.

4210
02:25:48,020 --> 02:25:51,740
And if we notice that there's a couple people out we'll just fully jump them.

4211
02:25:51,740 --> 02:25:53,260
Because again, you can't do anything.

4212
02:25:53,520 --> 02:25:54,980
And there's no friendly fire, right?

4213
02:25:55,660 --> 02:25:56,640
No friendly fire at all.

4214
02:25:56,720 --> 02:25:58,040
You can miss as many times as you want.

4215
02:25:58,640 --> 02:26:00,260
Every bun is four hits.

4216
02:26:00,440 --> 02:26:01,520
And every hit does one heart.

4217
02:26:01,580 --> 02:26:02,160
Everyone has four hearts.

4218
02:26:03,200 --> 02:26:04,860
Don't forget to extract.

4219
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:06,980
If you don't extract in time, you don't get to.

4220
02:26:07,580 --> 02:26:08,820
We go right?

4221
02:26:09,480 --> 02:26:10,520
Yeah, we're gonna go right.

4222
02:26:10,660 --> 02:26:11,360
Wolfie, what's...

4223
02:26:11,360 --> 02:26:12,440
I don't even know what skin you are.

4224
02:26:12,500 --> 02:26:14,060
What spot are you right now from one to five?

4225
02:26:14,820 --> 02:26:15,540
Far right.

4226
02:26:17,140 --> 02:26:18,440
You can pre-charge it.

4227
02:26:18,440 --> 02:26:20,400
Okay, I'm gonna try...

4228
02:26:21,940 --> 02:26:25,280
One of you guys on the left line, there's a smoke bomb in mid.

4229
02:26:25,340 --> 02:26:26,740
You can maybe grab that on the way.

4230
02:26:26,940 --> 02:26:28,820
Let's just all go right.

4231
02:26:29,060 --> 02:26:29,980
All go right.

4232
02:26:30,880 --> 02:26:31,940
Okay, I get it now.

4233
02:26:33,340 --> 02:26:34,680
They're also going right.

4234
02:26:35,180 --> 02:26:36,060
I see some of them.

4235
02:26:36,100 --> 02:26:36,460
Oh, okay.

4236
02:26:36,480 --> 02:26:37,000
I shot one.

4237
02:26:39,860 --> 02:26:42,160
You can launch over some of these walls sometimes.

4238
02:26:42,360 --> 02:26:43,920
In the arc, it might still get them.

4239
02:26:45,720 --> 02:26:46,320
Oh, no.

4240
02:26:46,320 --> 02:26:47,360
I got hit.

4241
02:26:51,100 --> 02:26:51,660
Oh, I'm dead.

4242
02:26:53,480 --> 02:26:53,960
Holy...

4243
02:26:53,960 --> 02:26:54,500
Wait, what?

4244
02:26:54,560 --> 02:26:55,380
There's a guy behind us!

4245
02:26:55,960 --> 02:26:56,920
He flanked.

4246
02:26:58,900 --> 02:27:00,680
No, I got flanked.

4247
02:27:00,980 --> 02:27:03,660
I don't like how two of the colors are the same.

4248
02:27:04,880 --> 02:27:06,620
I'm trying to figure out the map.

4249
02:27:07,980 --> 02:27:08,380
A two?

4250
02:27:08,760 --> 02:27:09,040
A three?

4251
02:27:09,040 --> 02:27:09,920
Oh, my god.

4252
02:27:09,920 --> 02:27:10,560
One of me too, actually.

4253
02:27:12,420 --> 02:27:13,060
Oh, damn.

4254
02:27:13,460 --> 02:27:15,920
I think I don't like the colors that you're seeing.

4255
02:27:17,180 --> 02:27:18,480
Yeah, you were cooking.

4256
02:27:19,300 --> 02:27:21,660
I don't know if we can all crowd in the same area.

4257
02:27:22,460 --> 02:27:25,020
Yeah, I think we just need to go more aggressive on the side.

4258
02:27:25,160 --> 02:27:29,080
Like when we were poking around the wall and stuff, we just need to go more aggressive, that's all.

4259
02:27:29,400 --> 02:27:30,400
Otherwise, it's fine.

4260
02:27:30,700 --> 02:27:32,060
It's not as different than what I usually play.

4261
02:27:32,080 --> 02:27:35,540
The fact that we were the same color, I thought I was my teammate.

4262
02:27:35,540 --> 02:27:37,540
Oh, that's a good one.

4263
02:27:37,840 --> 02:27:40,060
Shatter's also very, very good.

4264
02:27:40,420 --> 02:27:40,820
Yeah.

4265
02:27:41,920 --> 02:27:44,180
Shatter's like, honestly, debatably the number one.

4266
02:27:44,720 --> 02:27:45,920
Alright, let's go right.

4267
02:27:46,740 --> 02:27:46,960
Yeah.

4268
02:27:47,200 --> 02:27:47,400
Okay.

4269
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:49,160
I'll grab the smoke bomb.

4270
02:27:49,260 --> 02:27:51,540
Purple versus lighter purple, yeah, that's basically...

4271
02:27:52,060 --> 02:27:52,760
Yeah, pretty much.

4272
02:27:53,180 --> 02:27:56,000
I was like, hey, teammate, and then I got shot at.

4273
02:27:59,460 --> 02:28:00,980
Okay, I got a smoke bomb.

4274
02:28:01,880 --> 02:28:02,400
Grab the heart.

4275
02:28:02,400 --> 02:28:02,520
Okay.

4276
02:28:03,520 --> 02:28:04,720
Two people on me over here.

4277
02:28:05,800 --> 02:28:06,980
Oh my god, I'm getting cross-mapped.

4278
02:28:07,240 --> 02:28:08,140
Oh, I'm so close.

4279
02:28:09,380 --> 02:28:10,340
I'm dead here.

4280
02:28:11,240 --> 02:28:12,520
I'm also low-key dying.

4281
02:28:12,740 --> 02:28:13,120
I'm dead.

4282
02:28:14,080 --> 02:28:14,560
Okay.

4283
02:28:18,080 --> 02:28:20,380
There's one solo on Gumi right now.

4284
02:28:20,700 --> 02:28:22,900
Oh my god, they like...

4285
02:28:22,900 --> 02:28:23,580
Oh my god.

4286
02:28:25,180 --> 02:28:26,940
They like ganked up on us.

4287
02:28:27,020 --> 02:28:27,600
Holy shit.

4288
02:28:27,600 --> 02:28:27,940
Damn.

4289
02:28:28,980 --> 02:28:30,260
I'm refining strategy.

4290
02:28:33,940 --> 02:28:36,860
Low-key, what if we go through mid?

4291
02:28:37,020 --> 02:28:38,320
I feel like mid's uncontested.

4292
02:28:38,420 --> 02:28:38,880
We can flank.

4293
02:28:39,440 --> 02:28:41,480
Yeah, and they all just split up on us.

4294
02:28:41,600 --> 02:28:44,220
Maybe this map is better for flanking.

4295
02:28:45,540 --> 02:28:46,480
Because you're in a hallway.

4296
02:28:47,780 --> 02:28:53,360
I think two right so you can do that little fork that split one on either side of it, and then three mid.

4297
02:28:54,020 --> 02:28:56,100
The only problem is we don't get the health.

4298
02:28:56,760 --> 02:28:57,180
Yeah.

4299
02:28:59,260 --> 02:29:03,420
We can maybe do like partial one side, then partial mid.

4300
02:29:04,300 --> 02:29:04,720
Maybe?

4301
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:05,440
I don't know.

4302
02:29:06,200 --> 02:29:08,900
Because you want the health because it's just extra health.

4303
02:29:09,160 --> 02:29:11,880
You don't want them to have two extra HP.

4304
02:29:13,600 --> 02:29:14,180
Oh shit.

4305
02:29:14,860 --> 02:29:16,800
It's okay though, this is a learning experience.

4306
02:29:17,060 --> 02:29:17,700
Yeah, we're learning.

4307
02:29:18,100 --> 02:29:19,460
You could all rush the health and then split.

4308
02:29:19,540 --> 02:29:21,100
A couple go left, a couple stay right.

4309
02:29:21,240 --> 02:29:21,760
Yeah, yeah.

4310
02:29:21,760 --> 02:29:23,920
Like split into mid, right?

4311
02:29:24,280 --> 02:29:25,040
So you rush the health first.

4312
02:29:25,700 --> 02:29:28,820
Let's try to go left, and I'll try to do a mid flank.

4313
02:29:30,760 --> 02:29:33,180
Let's fight over the left area at least a couple times.

4314
02:29:34,420 --> 02:29:35,420
I'll try to flank mid.

4315
02:29:35,520 --> 02:29:36,600
I'll grab the smoke bomb as well.

4316
02:29:38,980 --> 02:29:40,420
Okay, are we contested here?

4317
02:29:41,320 --> 02:29:42,040
Yeah, we are.

4318
02:29:42,960 --> 02:29:43,860
I'm grabbing the health now.

4319
02:29:43,980 --> 02:29:44,640
Got it, yep.

4320
02:29:45,440 --> 02:29:46,700
Hit Lagundo, he's at two.

4321
02:29:48,060 --> 02:29:49,280
I am almost dead.

4322
02:29:49,280 --> 02:29:50,700
With extra health, I still got Lagundo.

4323
02:29:52,100 --> 02:29:52,960
That's crazy.

4324
02:29:54,040 --> 02:29:54,800
Oh, I got one.

4325
02:29:56,220 --> 02:29:57,600
I shot a lot on flank.

4326
02:29:57,700 --> 02:29:58,820
I think Parker's one.

4327
02:29:59,480 --> 02:29:59,980
In there.

4328
02:30:00,940 --> 02:30:02,260
Try to get some cover.

4329
02:30:04,360 --> 02:30:05,320
Cory's three.

4330
02:30:07,740 --> 02:30:08,560
Coming in.

4331
02:30:10,320 --> 02:30:11,800
One flank, one flank, one flank.

4332
02:30:12,500 --> 02:30:12,880
Yep, yep, yep.

4333
02:30:13,980 --> 02:30:14,540
Oh shit.

4334
02:30:16,100 --> 02:30:16,980
He's one on me.

4335
02:30:16,980 --> 02:30:17,360
I got one.

4336
02:30:19,640 --> 02:30:20,720
He's on me, he's on me.

4337
02:30:20,860 --> 02:30:21,620
Either one or two.

4338
02:30:21,880 --> 02:30:23,140
He's in the middle, I can't really ping him.

4339
02:30:23,280 --> 02:30:24,020
Yeah, nice.

4340
02:30:25,160 --> 02:30:26,540
Good job, good job.

4341
02:30:26,800 --> 02:30:27,300
Let's go.

4342
02:30:29,520 --> 02:30:29,880
Yippee.

4343
02:30:30,920 --> 02:30:32,520
We're figuring it out now.

4344
02:30:32,680 --> 02:30:33,740
We're figuring it out.

4345
02:30:35,600 --> 02:30:39,020
If you're really good in the charge, you can almost shotgun with the crossbow.

4346
02:30:39,360 --> 02:30:42,140
Yeah, it goes way faster than you would think.

4347
02:30:42,380 --> 02:30:44,420
I can only do it on NA ping though, I'm not gonna lie.

4348
02:30:44,420 --> 02:30:46,500
I keep getting diffed when people get on me.

4349
02:30:46,900 --> 02:30:47,660
That's fair, yeah.

4350
02:30:48,120 --> 02:30:49,960
I'll go for that flank again, I think it was okay.

4351
02:30:50,820 --> 02:30:51,860
I might join.

4352
02:30:52,900 --> 02:30:54,880
I flanked a little too and got a kill.

4353
02:30:55,680 --> 02:30:55,920
Yeah.

4354
02:30:56,400 --> 02:30:59,820
I got a lot of damage, I didn't get any kills, but I feel like I got a lot of pings.

4355
02:31:00,620 --> 02:31:01,200
Right, right, right.

4356
02:31:01,580 --> 02:31:02,540
Only four actually.

4357
02:31:03,440 --> 02:31:05,100
Oh, the charge is faster than I think.

4358
02:31:05,600 --> 02:31:07,780
Red team is cooking right now.

4359
02:31:07,900 --> 02:31:09,300
The points are crazy.

4360
02:31:09,620 --> 02:31:10,780
Let's go right, let's go right.

4361
02:31:10,780 --> 02:31:11,520
Let's go right.

4362
02:31:11,800 --> 02:31:14,580
Okay, I'll grab smoke bomb, or do you want to grab smoke bomb?

4363
02:31:14,600 --> 02:31:16,620
I'll grab smoke bomb, I'll grab smoke bomb and flank mid.

4364
02:31:18,620 --> 02:31:23,960
I'm gonna go down, so you guys go right top, I'm gonna go down like, can I ping that?

4365
02:31:24,800 --> 02:31:27,560
I'm gonna try to go down, I'm gonna do them down mid flank as well, you can come with me.

4366
02:31:28,660 --> 02:31:31,120
Okay, so we just have to hold these.

4367
02:31:31,420 --> 02:31:32,720
One's mid, one's holding mid here.

4368
02:31:32,800 --> 02:31:33,720
Oops, they got me once.

4369
02:31:33,880 --> 02:31:35,120
I'm just committing.

4370
02:31:36,380 --> 02:31:37,400
Oh, they got me too.

4371
02:31:37,980 --> 02:31:39,760
Oh, there's multiple in here.

4372
02:31:39,780 --> 02:31:41,020
Behind you, Motherfucker!

4373
02:31:42,240 --> 02:31:43,080
Right here?

4374
02:31:43,320 --> 02:31:44,540
Got one.

4375
02:31:45,480 --> 02:31:46,960
Oh, he hit me, but I might be dead.

4376
02:31:49,540 --> 02:31:51,160
One down, I'm dead.

4377
02:31:51,860 --> 02:31:53,640
Oh, I'm just blocking your vision, my bad.

4378
02:31:55,260 --> 02:31:56,700
I'm in their spawn.

4379
02:31:57,560 --> 02:31:59,260
This guy's going mid, around the left.

4380
02:32:00,920 --> 02:32:02,260
I don't know how much damage I got.

4381
02:32:02,660 --> 02:32:04,640
He's going left, he's going to you.

4382
02:32:04,640 --> 02:32:05,400
Oh, hello.

4383
02:32:06,040 --> 02:32:07,120
Okay, I shot him once.

4384
02:32:09,180 --> 02:32:10,440
He's going to your left.

4385
02:32:11,380 --> 02:32:12,380
Yeah, I just missed the cat.

4386
02:32:12,920 --> 02:32:13,700
He's going past mid.

4387
02:32:14,160 --> 02:32:15,400
I know I hit him once, at least.

4388
02:32:18,840 --> 02:32:20,720
She's in mid, left side over here.

4389
02:32:22,280 --> 02:32:22,960
I hit him once!

4390
02:32:23,840 --> 02:32:25,360
I definitely don't know the charge speed.

4391
02:32:26,580 --> 02:32:27,020
Nice!

4392
02:32:28,080 --> 02:32:28,520
Okay.

4393
02:32:29,460 --> 02:32:29,820
Large.

4394
02:32:30,540 --> 02:32:31,060
Large.

4395
02:32:33,240 --> 02:32:36,120
Yeah, I think the flank is 100% the play.

4396
02:32:36,300 --> 02:32:41,680
I beamed Joel down from max HP to dead in like 5 seconds.

4397
02:32:42,160 --> 02:32:44,600
He didn't see me at all.

4398
02:32:45,020 --> 02:32:46,600
I'll try to flank with you also.

4399
02:32:48,240 --> 02:32:49,600
We're the flankers now.

4400
02:32:51,280 --> 02:32:54,060
It's so map dependent, that's so interesting.

4401
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:56,200
Are you left or right side?

4402
02:32:56,660 --> 02:32:57,600
I'm left, far left.

4403
02:32:57,600 --> 02:32:59,060
Okay, let's go right then.

4404
02:32:59,220 --> 02:32:59,920
Let's go right as a team.

4405
02:33:01,360 --> 02:33:02,760
You three hold the front lines, we'll flank.

4406
02:33:03,340 --> 02:33:04,240
It kind of works out.

4407
02:33:06,260 --> 02:33:07,980
Okay, this is the charge speed.

4408
02:33:12,400 --> 02:33:13,260
Cpk's hit once.

4409
02:33:15,660 --> 02:33:16,400
I have two.

4410
02:33:17,620 --> 02:33:19,100
Shot one, shot another one.

4411
02:33:20,080 --> 02:33:20,780
One on me.

4412
02:33:21,580 --> 02:33:22,220
Far right.

4413
02:33:23,460 --> 02:33:25,460
I'm like beaming them right now, this is insane.

4414
02:33:26,060 --> 02:33:26,800
We can flank them here.

4415
02:33:26,800 --> 02:33:27,140
Two dead.

4416
02:33:29,980 --> 02:33:30,820
Where's the last guy?

4417
02:33:31,140 --> 02:33:31,480
One more.

4418
02:33:33,500 --> 02:33:34,800
I see him, he's over there.

4419
02:33:37,140 --> 02:33:37,800
He's on me.

4420
02:33:40,280 --> 02:33:41,080
He's low, he's low.

4421
02:33:41,720 --> 02:33:42,740
Oh no, he's low, I hit him once.

4422
02:33:44,420 --> 02:33:45,640
He's one hit, he's literally one.

4423
02:33:46,460 --> 02:33:47,600
No, he's literally one!

4424
02:33:51,280 --> 02:33:52,940
Yeah, we have to.

4425
02:33:52,940 --> 02:33:54,320
What is that early extraction, brother?

4426
02:33:54,320 --> 02:33:55,720
I was trying to...

4427
02:33:55,720 --> 02:33:58,240
No, no, no, no.

4428
02:33:58,380 --> 02:34:00,480
I was trying to get the high ground shot.

4429
02:34:00,760 --> 02:34:02,120
Okay, that's okay, fine.

4430
02:34:02,240 --> 02:34:03,460
You saved it, you saved it.

4431
02:34:03,560 --> 02:34:04,600
I committed, okay.

4432
02:34:05,580 --> 02:34:07,680
Hey, we're clutching up though.

4433
02:34:08,160 --> 02:34:09,380
Yeah, we're figuring it out.

4434
02:34:09,600 --> 02:34:11,780
It's so map dependent, that's so interesting.

4435
02:34:11,920 --> 02:34:14,320
It makes perfect sense, but like...

4436
02:34:16,200 --> 02:34:19,960
We won our last three games, but we're still...

4437
02:34:20,620 --> 02:34:21,520
We're still like...

4438
02:34:21,520 --> 02:34:22,700
I think it's because...

4439
02:34:22,700 --> 02:34:24,960
I think it's because...

4440
02:34:24,960 --> 02:34:27,300
The first two rounds, I think...

4441
02:34:27,300 --> 02:34:28,740
It's a lot closer than it used to be though.

4442
02:34:28,780 --> 02:34:29,440
Okay, let's go left.

4443
02:34:31,120 --> 02:34:32,980
I'm gonna go left and...

4444
02:34:32,980 --> 02:34:34,300
I'll go for the health actually.

4445
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:36,800
I'll contest.

4446
02:34:37,160 --> 02:34:42,660
I guess they're also alive too then, so...

4447
02:34:42,660 --> 02:34:43,980
I got health, I'm coming back.

4448
02:34:45,220 --> 02:34:46,240
I'm just gonna go down.

4449
02:34:47,760 --> 02:34:49,200
Right, they're shooting across.

4450
02:34:49,900 --> 02:34:51,000
They're all right.

4451
02:34:51,260 --> 02:34:53,300
Giving them info, I mean...

4452
02:34:53,300 --> 02:34:55,060
They're right here, homie.

4453
02:34:55,840 --> 02:34:57,000
I hit Anne once.

4454
02:34:58,860 --> 02:34:59,680
Hey man.

4455
02:35:00,980 --> 02:35:02,260
Crazy bait.

4456
02:35:03,800 --> 02:35:05,080
I'm gonna bait him again.

4457
02:35:05,800 --> 02:35:06,200
Come on, three.

4458
02:35:06,900 --> 02:35:08,760
Oh, Shadow hit once.

4459
02:35:09,700 --> 02:35:11,300
Oh no, I got hit.

4460
02:35:14,020 --> 02:35:15,720
That was his three HP.

4461
02:35:16,540 --> 02:35:17,820
Linking action, huge.

4462
02:35:18,280 --> 02:35:19,100
Who's in this building?

4463
02:35:19,220 --> 02:35:19,760
Wolfie, come push.

4464
02:35:21,080 --> 02:35:21,320
One HP.

4465
02:35:21,860 --> 02:35:22,260
Two HP.

4466
02:35:22,860 --> 02:35:27,400
Oh my god, nice shot.

4467
02:35:27,520 --> 02:35:28,580
Two on you, Giga.

4468
02:35:29,420 --> 02:35:29,940
Behind you.

4469
02:35:31,280 --> 02:35:31,900
One HP.

4470
02:35:33,380 --> 02:35:34,320
Oh, behind me.

4471
02:35:34,780 --> 02:35:37,100
One HP in the middle in front of you.

4472
02:35:37,120 --> 02:35:37,860
He's on your left, right there.

4473
02:35:38,580 --> 02:35:39,640
You got him, he's one.

4474
02:35:41,300 --> 02:35:42,320
He's still behind that wall.

4475
02:35:43,340 --> 02:35:44,760
He's got the peak advantage.

4476
02:35:44,760 --> 02:35:46,760
I know you're both glowing, so...

4477
02:35:47,860 --> 02:35:49,440
He's gonna head toward me.

4478
02:35:49,480 --> 02:35:50,600
He's gonna maybe try to extract.

4479
02:35:50,980 --> 02:35:51,740
Just play the kill.

4480
02:35:51,880 --> 02:35:52,900
If he tries to go up, it doesn't matter.

4481
02:35:53,500 --> 02:35:53,700
Yeah.

4482
02:35:56,040 --> 02:35:56,920
He's going, he's going.

4483
02:35:58,360 --> 02:35:58,760
No!

4484
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,040
That was so close, though.

4485
02:36:02,540 --> 02:36:03,840
That was really close.

4486
02:36:04,020 --> 02:36:04,500
That was close.

4487
02:36:04,780 --> 02:36:05,620
But he didn't get to extract.

4488
02:36:07,060 --> 02:36:07,660
Oh, we're third.

4489
02:36:09,220 --> 02:36:09,840
Yeah, let's go.

4490
02:36:10,800 --> 02:36:11,600
Let's go.

4491
02:36:11,600 --> 02:36:12,540
In the middle.

4492
02:36:12,920 --> 02:36:13,280
I'm running.

4493
02:36:14,180 --> 02:36:15,340
I'm actually running.

4494
02:36:16,520 --> 02:36:17,060
Uh...

4495
02:36:18,500 --> 02:36:20,300
I'll go for the flank.

4496
02:36:20,300 --> 02:36:20,540
I'll come with you.

4497
02:36:24,240 --> 02:36:25,180
Oh my god, two under.

4498
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:26,300
Smoking.

4499
02:36:27,220 --> 02:36:27,800
I can't help you.

4500
02:36:28,780 --> 02:36:29,720
I'm just spamming.

4501
02:36:30,340 --> 02:36:31,280
I can't see them.

4502
02:36:32,140 --> 02:36:34,460
I got MechaFox's two HP.

4503
02:36:35,720 --> 02:36:36,880
One HP MechaFox.

4504
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:38,440
I'm literally on five of them.

4505
02:36:38,520 --> 02:36:39,840
I don't know how I got in this situation.

4506
02:36:41,740 --> 02:36:42,420
One MechaFox's one.

4507
02:36:42,540 --> 02:36:43,420
Zam one HP, Zam one HP.

4508
02:36:43,840 --> 02:36:45,660
Four in their spawn, four in their spawn still.

4509
02:36:45,860 --> 02:36:47,420
And one's wrapping you guys to the left.

4510
02:36:48,180 --> 02:36:48,640
I see him.

4511
02:36:49,860 --> 02:36:50,500
One's under.

4512
02:36:52,020 --> 02:36:52,660
I'm coming.

4513
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:54,020
I'm going to go to their spawn.

4514
02:36:54,020 --> 02:36:54,580
One on me, one on me.

4515
02:36:55,480 --> 02:36:56,500
Oh, they're not in their spawn.

4516
02:36:56,640 --> 02:36:57,020
Oh, hello.

4517
02:36:58,160 --> 02:36:58,480
Nice.

4518
02:37:00,580 --> 02:37:01,400
One's high ground with me.

4519
02:37:01,480 --> 02:37:02,280
Above you right now.

4520
02:37:02,880 --> 02:37:03,200
Oh.

4521
02:37:06,340 --> 02:37:06,860
Oh, shit.

4522
02:37:07,420 --> 02:37:08,140
Nice, good shot.

4523
02:37:08,800 --> 02:37:10,400
Um, one is on...

4524
02:37:10,400 --> 02:37:11,340
Oh my god.

4525
02:37:13,640 --> 02:37:14,660
Two's going mid.

4526
02:37:14,940 --> 02:37:15,580
Two mid, two mid.

4527
02:37:15,840 --> 02:37:16,340
Two mid, two mid.

4528
02:37:18,520 --> 02:37:19,020
Pick him in the sky.

4529
02:37:20,500 --> 02:37:22,400
Oh, they're going...

4530
02:37:22,400 --> 02:37:23,440
On the left, both together.

4531
02:37:25,640 --> 02:37:27,400
Oh, that was fun.

4532
02:37:28,360 --> 02:37:29,200
That's all good though.

4533
02:37:29,280 --> 02:37:31,180
Hey, last round, we were pretty solid.

4534
02:37:31,660 --> 02:37:32,360
We did good, we did good.

4535
02:37:34,120 --> 02:37:36,840
Good recovery from...

4536
02:37:36,840 --> 02:37:38,100
Oh, we take a six, that's good too.

4537
02:37:38,240 --> 02:37:39,960
It's not that much of a point gap though.

4538
02:37:40,560 --> 02:37:42,120
Yeah, the middle's all the same.

4539
02:37:42,520 --> 02:37:44,480
So map dependent, I guess, yeah.

4540
02:37:44,680 --> 02:37:45,880
Flanks just make sense.

4541
02:37:46,640 --> 02:37:47,380
Glad we switched it up.

4542
02:37:48,520 --> 02:37:50,480
I got 38 damage, I might be top 5.

4543
02:37:50,640 --> 02:37:51,420
Oh, shit.

4544
02:37:52,980 --> 02:37:54,780
And 11 kills, I might be top 5.

4545
02:37:54,780 --> 02:37:55,980
Oh my god, you're gaming.

4546
02:37:56,840 --> 02:37:57,240
I know.

4547
02:37:58,020 --> 02:37:58,700
I know.

4548
02:38:01,240 --> 02:38:02,660
They game even harder.

4549
02:38:11,500 --> 02:38:12,820
Oh, hey, we're still...

4550
02:38:12,820 --> 02:38:15,300
That's crazy how we're still first.

4551
02:38:24,960 --> 02:38:27,120
Oh, party game, let's go.

4552
02:38:32,760 --> 02:38:34,060
Party game time.

4553
02:38:34,760 --> 02:38:35,540
There's one in the middle.

4554
02:38:36,060 --> 02:38:36,160
Yeah.

4555
02:38:37,340 --> 02:38:38,180
I like that.

4556
02:38:38,320 --> 02:38:39,760
We can split, I don't know.

4557
02:38:40,340 --> 02:38:41,380
Oh, I got 10.

4558
02:38:43,760 --> 02:38:44,600
I got 14.

4559
02:38:45,100 --> 02:38:46,380
Dude, beat the MC, got 11.

4560
02:38:46,380 --> 02:38:47,840
Where was this last event?

4561
02:38:48,140 --> 02:38:48,480
What?

4562
02:38:50,760 --> 02:38:54,020
It's okay, not last, guys.

4563
02:38:56,060 --> 02:38:56,600
Oh, shit.

4564
02:38:59,020 --> 02:38:59,460
Rough.

4565
02:39:05,740 --> 02:39:07,260
I'm surprised by this board.

4566
02:39:07,580 --> 02:39:10,180
I did not expect to get fourth, but I guess fine brick difference, you know.

4567
02:39:10,340 --> 02:39:11,900
Brother, one more game, lock in.

4568
02:39:11,980 --> 02:39:12,600
Could be sixth.

4569
02:39:13,440 --> 02:39:14,860
We need to focus.

4570
02:39:15,560 --> 02:39:17,160
Is it we play both the...

4571
02:39:17,160 --> 02:39:19,240
The Splatoon and the Get Down for party?

4572
02:39:19,700 --> 02:39:20,260
Or...

4573
02:39:20,260 --> 02:39:21,920
It's like a few minigames.

4574
02:39:22,280 --> 02:39:24,600
Splatoon, the Go Down, we play...

4575
02:39:25,180 --> 02:39:27,460
Like Photon, which is like Valorant Deathmatch.

4576
02:39:27,820 --> 02:39:28,160
Okay.

4577
02:39:28,260 --> 02:39:31,140
And then we play Heist, which is like Payday.

4578
02:39:31,340 --> 02:39:33,660
Oh, so that's all in the minigames.

4579
02:39:33,840 --> 02:39:34,120
Oh.

4580
02:39:34,760 --> 02:39:36,340
Okay, okay, I understand.

4581
02:39:36,580 --> 02:39:37,760
We just do like one of each.

4582
02:39:38,340 --> 02:39:39,720
Oh, okay.

4583
02:39:39,720 --> 02:39:39,880
Okay.

4584
02:39:42,100 --> 02:39:43,280
Do like all these...

4585
02:39:43,280 --> 02:39:45,840
Do like most of the games repeat for Block Wars?

4586
02:39:46,040 --> 02:39:48,000
Or like...

4587
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:49,020
Uh, you mean like...

4588
02:39:49,460 --> 02:39:51,120
There's the eight here that we're playing.

4589
02:39:51,280 --> 02:39:54,260
There's Trailblazers, which is a movement type game.

4590
02:39:54,380 --> 02:39:56,040
Where you get to like choose what you're doing.

4591
02:39:56,140 --> 02:39:57,000
So there's like...

4592
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,140
You have 12 minutes and it's just all individual.

4593
02:39:59,320 --> 02:40:01,940
And you can do like parkour, you can do elytra stuff.

4594
02:40:02,020 --> 02:40:04,060
You can do boat stuff, you can do trident stuff.

4595
02:40:04,160 --> 02:40:05,320
You can do block placing stuff.

4596
02:40:05,440 --> 02:40:07,240
It's like a race that you kind of get to choose what you're doing.

4597
02:40:07,240 --> 02:40:07,940
So it's kind of cool.

4598
02:40:09,620 --> 02:40:10,600
That's one of the games.

4599
02:40:10,840 --> 02:40:13,140
Another one of the games is...

4600
02:40:13,140 --> 02:40:13,740
Construction.

4601
02:40:15,820 --> 02:40:16,300
And...

4602
02:40:16,300 --> 02:40:17,940
That's just a building game.

4603
02:40:18,200 --> 02:40:19,760
And it's, I think, getting reworked.

4604
02:40:19,940 --> 02:40:20,540
Or recoded.

4605
02:40:20,620 --> 02:40:20,980
Or both.

4606
02:40:21,580 --> 02:40:23,500
Well, that's why it's a 2-2-1.

4607
02:40:24,420 --> 02:40:24,960
No comment.

4608
02:40:25,340 --> 02:40:25,760
And then...

4609
02:40:26,320 --> 02:40:27,480
I'm forgetting one.

4610
02:40:29,580 --> 02:40:31,100
I'm fairly sure that's it.

4611
02:40:31,580 --> 02:40:32,580
I knew it.

4612
02:40:33,080 --> 02:40:34,100
Guys, I'm not bad.

4613
02:40:34,140 --> 02:40:35,640
I'm just inexperienced.

4614
02:40:35,640 --> 02:40:36,440
Okay, guys.

4615
02:40:37,140 --> 02:40:38,280
Skyzone is dead.

4616
02:40:40,320 --> 02:40:41,060
Skyzone is dead.

4617
02:40:41,520 --> 02:40:43,520
I'm just inexperienced.

4618
02:40:47,220 --> 02:40:49,200
These maps come back, guys.

4619
02:40:51,140 --> 02:40:52,580
I forgot to vote, guys.

4620
02:40:52,620 --> 02:40:53,260
This is tragic.

4621
02:40:53,560 --> 02:40:54,880
I wonder what game it's gonna be.

4622
02:40:55,020 --> 02:40:56,600
What game are we gonna play?

4623
02:40:57,380 --> 02:40:58,700
I won a bunch, too.

4624
02:40:58,820 --> 02:40:59,360
Hey, guys.

4625
02:40:59,440 --> 02:41:01,400
I love getting people out of a 1x5.

4626
02:41:01,400 --> 02:41:02,240
This is like a mosh pit.

4627
02:41:02,360 --> 02:41:03,400
Oh my god, that's mosh.

4628
02:41:07,060 --> 02:41:07,780
All right.

4629
02:41:09,540 --> 02:41:10,840
Oh, this is a new hub.

4630
02:41:10,960 --> 02:41:12,060
I forgot they made a new hub.

4631
02:41:12,180 --> 02:41:12,960
Oh, yeah.

4632
02:41:13,360 --> 02:41:14,400
How are you doing?

4633
02:41:15,560 --> 02:41:18,820
We're playing Morse code on the screen.

4634
02:41:18,960 --> 02:41:19,400
What the hell?

4635
02:41:20,020 --> 02:41:20,560
Single Neo.

4636
02:41:20,880 --> 02:41:21,560
Holy moly.

4637
02:41:22,160 --> 02:41:22,480
Oh, yeah.

4638
02:41:22,600 --> 02:41:23,480
So, also...

4639
02:41:23,480 --> 02:41:25,580
Last game, the scores were hidden.

4640
02:41:25,760 --> 02:41:27,720
So, we won't be able to see how well anyone's doing.

4641
02:41:28,020 --> 02:41:28,780
Oh, I see.

4642
02:41:29,680 --> 02:41:30,500
Why did they make the triple Neo...

4643
02:41:30,500 --> 02:41:31,440
It's like an arcade.

4644
02:41:31,840 --> 02:41:32,340
We're in an arcade.

4645
02:41:32,340 --> 02:41:33,720
Why did they make the triple Neo, like, barrier?

4646
02:41:33,960 --> 02:41:36,020
You should actually have to hit it.

4647
02:41:37,460 --> 02:41:38,400
What do you mean they make it barrier?

4648
02:41:39,160 --> 02:41:40,760
Like, the ground is one block tall.

4649
02:41:40,900 --> 02:41:42,680
Like, they should make this, like, two down.

4650
02:41:43,240 --> 02:41:43,540
Over here.

4651
02:41:43,720 --> 02:41:45,380
So, if you're standing on the triple Neo...

4652
02:41:45,380 --> 02:41:47,240
You're like a pro, you know?

4653
02:41:48,180 --> 02:41:49,140
Like Fargo Master.

4654
02:41:49,360 --> 02:41:50,080
Like Fargo Civilization.

4655
02:41:50,220 --> 02:41:51,640
Right, right, right, right, right.

4656
02:41:56,180 --> 02:41:58,340
Oh my god, it's the construction guy.

4657
02:41:59,020 --> 02:42:00,160
Oh my god.

4658
02:42:00,160 --> 02:42:01,300
What's happening?

4659
02:42:01,980 --> 02:42:02,260
What?

4660
02:42:03,040 --> 02:42:06,280
Okay, is this all lagging for you guys or is it...

4661
02:42:06,280 --> 02:42:09,060
Oh my god, that's a lot of blocks.

4662
02:42:10,420 --> 02:42:11,560
Holy shit.

4663
02:42:11,940 --> 02:42:14,120
The camera couldn't even load those blocks in.

4664
02:42:20,070 --> 02:42:20,990
Oh my god.

4665
02:42:22,750 --> 02:42:23,510
Heist.

4666
02:42:25,150 --> 02:42:25,650
Heist.

4667
02:42:27,370 --> 02:42:28,130
Everybody.

4668
02:42:30,390 --> 02:42:30,730
No.

4669
02:42:37,740 --> 02:42:39,980
They're all lagging on Discord.

4670
02:42:40,980 --> 02:42:42,320
Oh no.

4671
02:42:43,020 --> 02:42:44,760
What the fuck do I do with a stick?

4672
02:42:45,840 --> 02:42:48,420
What to do with stick.

4673
02:42:49,220 --> 02:42:51,740
What does

4674
02:42:55,800 --> 02:42:56,400
stick mean?

4675
02:42:57,640 --> 02:42:58,160
Oh no.

4676
02:42:58,880 --> 02:43:01,180
Oh, it's knockback stick.

4677
02:43:01,380 --> 02:43:01,580
Okay.

4678
02:43:02,120 --> 02:43:02,820
Get away.

4679
02:43:03,720 --> 02:43:04,520
Get away.

4680
02:43:07,340 --> 02:43:07,740
Alright.

4681
02:43:08,460 --> 02:43:10,140
Wait, maybe PVP will be there immediately.

4682
02:43:10,260 --> 02:43:10,880
Who can we bully?

4683
02:43:10,980 --> 02:43:11,740
Let's go for blue team.

4684
02:43:14,500 --> 02:43:18,680
I'm gonna run at blue team with my knockback stick and stop them from entering the bank.

4685
02:43:18,920 --> 02:43:19,720
Oh, are we back?

4686
02:43:20,160 --> 02:43:21,200
Yeah, we're back.

4687
02:43:21,500 --> 02:43:25,060
Where do we deposit our money?

4688
02:43:25,740 --> 02:43:27,140
See this truck to the right?

4689
02:43:27,220 --> 02:43:28,260
With the arrow on it?

4690
02:43:28,380 --> 02:43:29,520
You go in there and you deposit.

4691
02:43:29,520 --> 02:43:33,320
You go in and the higher quality ore blocks you mine, the more points you get.

4692
02:43:33,480 --> 02:43:35,560
Higher up in the thing.

4693
02:43:36,320 --> 02:43:37,020
Do we run in?

4694
02:43:37,080 --> 02:43:37,820
Do we have to hit anything?

4695
02:43:38,900 --> 02:43:40,600
No, you just run in and you mine stuff.

4696
02:43:40,680 --> 02:43:43,020
There's gonna be mobs and I think we just knock back them away.

4697
02:43:44,540 --> 02:43:45,200
Get away.

4698
02:43:46,140 --> 02:43:46,760
Get away.

4699
02:43:47,880 --> 02:43:51,780
So it's like when you spray holy water on the demons, you use that.

4700
02:43:54,600 --> 02:43:56,120
Don't let the demons get you.

4701
02:43:56,420 --> 02:43:57,260
That's pretty cool.

4702
02:43:57,260 --> 02:43:59,320
Don't let the demons get you.

4703
02:44:03,920 --> 02:44:04,540
Let's go.

4704
02:44:05,660 --> 02:44:07,700
I'm gonna full send top floor if I die.

4705
02:44:10,080 --> 02:44:10,920
We're just waiting.

4706
02:44:11,560 --> 02:44:12,300
I'm just not even...

4707
02:44:12,300 --> 02:44:13,960
Do you know how long we have to play?

4708
02:44:15,580 --> 02:44:16,680
Probably two or three.

4709
02:44:16,840 --> 02:44:18,160
Between two and three, probably.

4710
02:44:19,160 --> 02:44:20,120
I don't even know if I readied it.

4711
02:44:20,180 --> 02:44:20,560
Oh, I did.

4712
02:44:20,640 --> 02:44:22,020
I think there's an overtime as well.

4713
02:44:22,560 --> 02:44:25,020
I think there's a 30 second overtime that you can use to get out.

4714
02:44:25,020 --> 02:44:27,160
Oh, it starts in 12 seconds.

4715
02:44:27,940 --> 02:44:28,380
Yes.

4716
02:44:28,580 --> 02:44:29,500
Do we have speed or not?

4717
02:44:29,600 --> 02:44:30,020
Probably not, right?

4718
02:44:30,140 --> 02:44:30,860
Yes, yes.

4719
02:44:31,080 --> 02:44:31,600
Oh, yeah.

4720
02:44:32,740 --> 02:44:34,100
You start with speed.

4721
02:44:34,320 --> 02:44:37,320
The more stuff you have on you, the slower you become.

4722
02:44:37,880 --> 02:44:38,160
Okay.

4723
02:44:38,560 --> 02:44:39,840
It's like a realistic weight mechanics.

4724
02:44:42,060 --> 02:44:43,520
Yeah, I'm also sending top floor.

4725
02:44:45,100 --> 02:44:45,840
That'd be funny.

4726
02:44:51,680 --> 02:44:53,180
Whoa, don't hit me.

4727
02:44:53,200 --> 02:44:55,220
I don't know where up is here.

4728
02:44:56,320 --> 02:44:56,960
I'm going up.

4729
02:44:56,960 --> 02:44:58,940
Yeah, this is just not where I'm supposed to go.

4730
02:44:59,040 --> 02:44:59,360
Never mind.

4731
02:44:59,480 --> 02:44:59,740
Oopsie.

4732
02:45:01,280 --> 02:45:02,640
I don't have any diamonds.

4733
02:45:02,780 --> 02:45:03,840
Oh, they're fine.

4734
02:45:05,900 --> 02:45:07,700
Now I don't know how to parkour this.

4735
02:45:09,280 --> 02:45:11,900
I'll just be the poor little iron girl.

4736
02:45:12,420 --> 02:45:13,120
Wait, maybe not.

4737
02:45:16,420 --> 02:45:17,240
Oh, hello.

4738
02:45:20,520 --> 02:45:22,660
Yeah, yeah, we can knock each other.

4739
02:45:23,620 --> 02:45:23,780
Yeah.

4740
02:45:26,120 --> 02:45:27,480
How did you get roof?

4741
02:45:27,560 --> 02:45:28,940
Is there just one path that I need to find?

4742
02:45:29,160 --> 02:45:29,940
I think it's in the back.

4743
02:45:31,100 --> 02:45:35,120
Oh, my speed has decreased so much.

4744
02:45:35,180 --> 02:45:35,660
Holy fuck.

4745
02:45:36,960 --> 02:45:39,260
Oh, that is a roof.

4746
02:45:39,400 --> 02:45:40,760
We're gonna head back now.

4747
02:45:40,840 --> 02:45:42,800
I'm just gonna go deposit now.

4748
02:45:43,100 --> 02:45:43,380
Honestly.

4749
02:45:44,580 --> 02:45:45,740
What is this place?

4750
02:45:46,940 --> 02:45:47,700
I'm lost.

4751
02:45:50,720 --> 02:45:51,660
That's all good.

4752
02:45:52,480 --> 02:45:53,760
Oh, there it is.

4753
02:45:54,800 --> 02:45:55,500
I see it.

4754
02:45:56,880 --> 02:45:57,360
Emeralds.

4755
02:45:58,400 --> 02:45:59,460
What the fuck?

4756
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:01,100
Oh, I'm dead.

4757
02:46:01,300 --> 02:46:01,800
Okay, sick.

4758
02:46:02,960 --> 02:46:03,620
That's crazy.

4759
02:46:03,860 --> 02:46:04,740
The Ravager is insane.

4760
02:46:05,120 --> 02:46:06,180
Well, I just lost all my points.

4761
02:46:06,300 --> 02:46:06,660
That's awesome.

4762
02:46:07,460 --> 02:46:09,300
40% of your stuff drops?

4763
02:46:09,480 --> 02:46:10,040
Or something like that?

4764
02:46:10,460 --> 02:46:15,420
It drops it on the floor, but I just don't have anything anywhere.

4765
02:46:15,720 --> 02:46:17,340
I'm gonna go back and deposit now.

4766
02:46:17,340 --> 02:46:18,320
I got a diamond.

4767
02:46:19,440 --> 02:46:19,960
Oh.

4768
02:46:21,280 --> 02:46:23,400
I deposited 19 orbs.

4769
02:46:23,400 --> 02:46:23,660
Let's go.

4770
02:46:25,880 --> 02:46:27,560
That's gonna be my next wave.

4771
02:46:28,560 --> 02:46:29,380
Oh, golly.

4772
02:46:29,740 --> 02:46:30,020
Oh, golly.

4773
02:46:30,340 --> 02:46:33,860
I just got shot by a thing that was not...

4774
02:46:33,860 --> 02:46:34,740
Wait, what?

4775
02:46:35,300 --> 02:46:35,820
Oh!

4776
02:46:37,720 --> 02:46:39,160
Now I know why they were running.

4777
02:46:39,500 --> 02:46:39,760
Ow, ow.

4778
02:46:40,820 --> 02:46:41,540
Oh, my God, I can't.

4779
02:46:43,720 --> 02:46:44,500
Oh, my God.

4780
02:46:44,540 --> 02:46:46,480
All the mobs are gone, I believe.

4781
02:46:46,480 --> 02:46:47,580
Oh, there's so many.

4782
02:46:48,420 --> 02:46:48,760
No, I believe.

4783
02:46:49,940 --> 02:46:51,700
Oh, I need to get out so I don't die.

4784
02:46:52,800 --> 02:46:53,820
Hello, everybody.

4785
02:46:55,040 --> 02:46:55,740
Wait, are we still...

4786
02:46:55,740 --> 02:46:57,060
I don't know how to get out of here.

4787
02:46:59,520 --> 02:47:00,360
It's truly...

4788
02:47:00,360 --> 02:47:01,080
Oh, I died.

4789
02:47:01,900 --> 02:47:03,380
No, I had so much stuff.

4790
02:47:03,580 --> 02:47:05,780
Yeah, don't be greedy, guys.

4791
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:06,720
Don't be greedy.

4792
02:47:07,280 --> 02:47:10,200
I'm taking what I got and brain that I can get out.

4793
02:47:10,680 --> 02:47:12,320
Don't be greedy, everybody.

4794
02:47:12,320 --> 02:47:12,360
Don't be greedy.

4795
02:47:14,680 --> 02:47:15,760
Just dodge and weave.

4796
02:47:15,920 --> 02:47:18,700
I'm gonna die immediately.

4797
02:47:18,840 --> 02:47:19,300
No, I'm out.

4798
02:47:20,280 --> 02:47:21,240
Dodge and weave.

4799
02:47:24,640 --> 02:47:25,760
Oh, it's cooked.

4800
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:28,620
Holy fuck, there's like 40 of them in one spot.

4801
02:47:29,120 --> 02:47:29,440
I can't leave.

4802
02:47:29,580 --> 02:47:31,060
I can't leave.

4803
02:47:31,940 --> 02:47:34,120
There's just a ravager in the fucking one doorway.

4804
02:47:34,940 --> 02:47:35,640
Oh, my God.

4805
02:47:35,940 --> 02:47:36,820
Oh, my God.

4806
02:47:36,820 --> 02:47:39,020
Oh, my God.

4807
02:47:39,020 --> 02:47:40,080
I scored 0 points.

4808
02:47:40,240 --> 02:47:40,740
I scored 0 points.

4809
02:47:41,080 --> 02:47:43,760
I scored 0 as well.

4810
02:47:44,940 --> 02:47:46,240
I scored too.

4811
02:47:46,700 --> 02:47:47,100
I scored.

4812
02:47:48,280 --> 02:47:49,960
Oh, my God.

4813
02:47:51,180 --> 02:47:53,640
I got 236 in one party game.

4814
02:47:53,740 --> 02:47:54,360
Let's go.

4815
02:47:55,500 --> 02:47:56,800
I got 0 points.

4816
02:47:57,720 --> 02:48:01,320
Why is there one guy like right here just...

4817
02:48:01,320 --> 02:48:02,540
He's just...

4818
02:48:02,540 --> 02:48:03,920
He's just...

4819
02:48:05,080 --> 02:48:07,260
There's one just guarding it.

4820
02:48:07,260 --> 02:48:10,600
Don't be greedy, guys.

4821
02:48:13,780 --> 02:48:15,320
That's raw points.

4822
02:48:16,900 --> 02:48:18,920
I'm in the barriers again.

4823
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:20,220
I got 236.

4824
02:48:20,460 --> 02:48:21,500
That's crazy.

4825
02:48:22,280 --> 02:48:22,920
36.

4826
02:48:24,860 --> 02:48:25,500
Damn.

4827
02:48:26,200 --> 02:48:30,380
I don't know if I did good.

4828
02:48:30,700 --> 02:48:32,240
I got no points, that's so funny.

4829
02:48:32,520 --> 02:48:32,980
That's crazy.

4830
02:48:32,980 --> 02:48:34,060
It's just how I did the math.

4831
02:48:34,140 --> 02:48:36,040
There's like a pack of a billion of them.

4832
02:48:36,400 --> 02:48:37,840
Please give me go down.

4833
02:48:38,380 --> 02:48:39,480
Go down.

4834
02:48:42,160 --> 02:48:43,280
Splatoon time.

4835
02:48:44,720 --> 02:48:51,380
Dude, I was on one heart at the top for so long.

4836
02:48:52,540 --> 02:48:53,660
Fine, I was cooked.

4837
02:48:53,860 --> 02:48:55,380
I had points to go back.

4838
02:48:55,660 --> 02:49:01,660
The one path downward was blocked by a ravager and about 20 other motherfuckers over there.

4839
02:49:01,660 --> 02:49:02,820
And I just couldn't go there.

4840
02:49:03,820 --> 02:49:06,160
And then I ran back and there was another 10.

4841
02:49:06,800 --> 02:49:08,280
Where are we going?

4842
02:49:09,100 --> 02:49:09,640
Down.

4843
02:49:10,480 --> 02:49:11,260
Do we just spray?

4844
02:49:12,700 --> 02:49:14,000
It's time to goon.

4845
02:49:14,460 --> 02:49:15,740
You can hit each other.

4846
02:49:15,880 --> 02:49:16,840
You can hit other players.

4847
02:49:19,660 --> 02:49:21,320
We just start gooning.

4848
02:49:21,720 --> 02:49:22,560
Oh my god.

4849
02:49:23,120 --> 02:49:23,700
I'm gooning.

4850
02:49:25,760 --> 02:49:27,500
You can hit walls and ceiling.

4851
02:49:27,900 --> 02:49:29,420
How do we...

4852
02:49:29,420 --> 02:49:30,080
Out of ink?

4853
02:49:30,400 --> 02:49:33,460
Oh, it is like...

4854
02:49:33,460 --> 02:49:33,880
Splatoon.

4855
02:49:34,900 --> 02:49:36,660
You have to hold crush.

4856
02:49:38,260 --> 02:49:40,320
Freaking fire breath man.

4857
02:49:42,280 --> 02:49:44,220
Wait, I can die?

4858
02:49:45,900 --> 02:49:46,060
Yeah.

4859
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:48,000
What the fuck?

4860
02:49:48,060 --> 02:49:49,280
I would've been shooting in the beginning.

4861
02:49:52,560 --> 02:49:56,100
If I knew it's over for you.

4862
02:49:57,820 --> 02:49:58,800
If I knew...

4863
02:49:58,800 --> 02:49:59,560
I thought this was...

4864
02:49:59,560 --> 02:50:01,080
I thought this was just chill.

4865
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:04,660
This fuck guy is going...

4866
02:50:04,660 --> 02:50:05,540
Beaming for my eyes.

4867
02:50:05,940 --> 02:50:06,500
Come back here.

4868
02:50:07,740 --> 02:50:10,300
Now that I know it's no longer chill.

4869
02:50:14,260 --> 02:50:16,480
I'm just covering all the high walls.

4870
02:50:16,800 --> 02:50:18,280
Do the buildings count too?

4871
02:50:18,380 --> 02:50:18,880
Like walls?

4872
02:50:18,920 --> 02:50:21,160
Yeah, every single block.

4873
02:50:21,220 --> 02:50:22,480
Oh no, he got me.

4874
02:50:26,360 --> 02:50:27,220
Jesus Christ.

4875
02:50:27,220 --> 02:50:29,120
Just get like high ground and start launching.

4876
02:50:32,110 --> 02:50:35,230
Yeah, I'm trying to grab the ones that aren't even inked yet.

4877
02:50:35,230 --> 02:50:35,770
Oh my god.

4878
02:50:36,170 --> 02:50:36,390
Oh?

4879
02:50:39,050 --> 02:50:41,010
Can kills like give us more ink?

4880
02:50:41,270 --> 02:50:43,330
Kills give just hella points.

4881
02:50:43,650 --> 02:50:44,410
Oh it does?

4882
02:50:44,670 --> 02:50:46,550
You do get um...

4883
02:50:46,550 --> 02:50:48,430
You actually get ink bombs for kills.

4884
02:50:49,030 --> 02:50:50,230
So it does actually give.

4885
02:50:50,250 --> 02:50:50,770
Oh shit.

4886
02:50:52,090 --> 02:50:55,010
I got like fucking ran at by 20 people.

4887
02:50:56,190 --> 02:50:58,570
I tried to 1v1 CPK and I died.

4888
02:50:59,190 --> 02:51:01,510
Dude, the fucking ink bomb used to do damage and they didn't.

4889
02:51:01,670 --> 02:51:02,490
They changed my game.

4890
02:51:02,570 --> 02:51:03,230
They ruined my baby.

4891
02:51:03,610 --> 02:51:05,750
They ruined your baby.

4892
02:51:06,070 --> 02:51:07,230
This is so messed up.

4893
02:51:08,110 --> 02:51:09,870
How could they do such a thing?

4894
02:51:12,310 --> 02:51:13,130
Player spotted.

4895
02:51:13,510 --> 02:51:13,950
It's fruit berries.

4896
02:51:16,830 --> 02:51:17,270
Hello?

4897
02:51:18,630 --> 02:51:19,070
What?

4898
02:51:19,430 --> 02:51:20,050
It doesn't matter.

4899
02:51:20,470 --> 02:51:21,050
It's fine actually.

4900
02:51:21,050 --> 02:51:22,890
I almost got him.

4901
02:51:24,810 --> 02:51:25,650
Come on.

4902
02:51:26,050 --> 02:51:27,810
Is that a good hit?

4903
02:51:28,750 --> 02:51:30,910
I'm going random spray around the map strat.

4904
02:51:31,930 --> 02:51:34,950
Just hold right click and start geeking on the spray.

4905
02:51:35,210 --> 02:51:35,430
No!

4906
02:51:35,510 --> 02:51:36,910
I got hit by behind!

4907
02:51:37,130 --> 02:51:38,110
The third parties!

4908
02:51:38,670 --> 02:51:39,150
Stop!

4909
02:51:41,570 --> 02:51:42,950
Oh my god, this Firebrand loves it.

4910
02:51:43,150 --> 02:51:45,090
Third parties should be illegal.

4911
02:51:45,650 --> 02:51:47,170
I got 22 kills.

4912
02:51:47,430 --> 02:51:47,890
Nice.

4913
02:51:47,890 --> 02:51:49,210
I got 5.

4914
02:51:49,210 --> 02:51:50,970
I actually think I'm getting bottom 10 this game.

4915
02:51:51,070 --> 02:51:51,750
It's crazy.

4916
02:51:52,710 --> 02:51:54,950
I'm actually destined for greatness right now.

4917
02:51:55,790 --> 02:51:57,350
Wolfie, what happened to you?

4918
02:51:57,790 --> 02:52:01,070
I got 0 points in heist.

4919
02:52:01,690 --> 02:52:02,570
Absolutely 0.

4920
02:52:02,730 --> 02:52:06,710
I got 5 kills here, which is alright.

4921
02:52:08,270 --> 02:52:09,690
I'm going to be right there with you.

4922
02:52:10,330 --> 02:52:11,430
Oh my god.

4923
02:52:13,410 --> 02:52:14,850
Wait, does it not tell you your points?

4924
02:52:14,850 --> 02:52:17,190
It only adds the blocks?

4925
02:52:18,970 --> 02:52:23,170
Well, we don't get to know points right now because it's like game 8 hidden scores.

4926
02:52:23,290 --> 02:52:25,490
Oh my god, new Photon map!

4927
02:52:25,870 --> 02:52:27,610
This map looks crazy.

4928
02:52:30,530 --> 02:52:31,050
Deathmatch!

4929
02:52:31,450 --> 02:52:31,630
Okay.

4930
02:52:33,110 --> 02:52:34,570
No, he saw me!

4931
02:52:35,390 --> 02:52:36,370
What the hell just happened?

4932
02:52:36,630 --> 02:52:39,590
I see fruit and I'm trying to crouch away from him.

4933
02:52:40,770 --> 02:52:41,850
Please, I'm a baby.

4934
02:52:42,050 --> 02:52:42,990
Don't do anything.

4935
02:52:42,990 --> 02:52:44,290
I'm just going to come up to you.

4936
02:52:44,290 --> 02:52:44,930
I'm turning up the music.

4937
02:52:46,390 --> 02:52:47,670
I'm going to die instantly here.

4938
02:52:48,230 --> 02:52:49,950
There's a guy right in front of me.

4939
02:52:50,570 --> 02:52:52,330
No, this is for people who love Boomer Shooters.

4940
02:52:52,450 --> 02:52:52,770
Trust.

4941
02:52:52,910 --> 02:52:53,210
No!

4942
02:52:53,570 --> 02:52:55,970
I had 2 people on me?!

4943
02:52:59,650 --> 02:53:02,350
I literally had 2 people on me.

4944
02:53:02,470 --> 02:53:03,630
That's actually...

4945
02:53:03,630 --> 02:53:06,850
I'm literally spawning into people.

4946
02:53:07,190 --> 02:53:07,670
Holy shit.

4947
02:53:09,350 --> 02:53:10,230
What the...

4948
02:53:10,230 --> 02:53:12,350
What the fuck was I supposed to do?

4949
02:53:12,950 --> 02:53:13,710
Oh my god.

4950
02:53:14,810 --> 02:53:17,090
Oh my god, thank fucking god.

4951
02:53:17,870 --> 02:53:19,110
I was going to be so mad.

4952
02:53:20,750 --> 02:53:22,550
Oh my god, I killed a country soldier.

4953
02:53:24,230 --> 02:53:25,390
I died, okay.

4954
02:53:28,310 --> 02:53:28,810
Minot!

4955
02:53:29,470 --> 02:53:29,810
Minot!

4956
02:53:31,130 --> 02:53:31,850
I'm winning.

4957
02:53:33,150 --> 02:53:34,090
Where am I going?

4958
02:53:34,490 --> 02:53:35,850
Oh, there's always someone behind me.

4959
02:53:36,190 --> 02:53:37,730
Yeah, no, that happens to me too.

4960
02:53:39,530 --> 02:53:40,330
Oh, nice.

4961
02:53:42,330 --> 02:53:43,210
Oh, get sniped.

4962
02:53:43,350 --> 02:53:44,410
Oh, come on, man.

4963
02:53:44,710 --> 02:53:45,710
Wait, what?

4964
02:53:46,330 --> 02:53:47,810
I can't find anyone.

4965
02:53:48,470 --> 02:53:49,170
What do you mean?

4966
02:53:50,670 --> 02:53:51,590
Okay, nice.

4967
02:53:52,610 --> 02:53:54,330
Oh, I'm figuring it out.

4968
02:53:57,950 --> 02:53:58,610
Behind me?

4969
02:53:58,710 --> 02:53:59,110
In front of me?

4970
02:53:59,270 --> 02:53:59,670
To the side?

4971
02:53:59,790 --> 02:54:00,110
To the left?

4972
02:54:00,210 --> 02:54:00,430
To the right?

4973
02:54:00,450 --> 02:54:01,590
That was me when I spawned in.

4974
02:54:01,650 --> 02:54:02,470
I know how you feel.

4975
02:54:02,690 --> 02:54:03,750
This guy's on the floor.

4976
02:54:04,250 --> 02:54:04,890
XShatter's cheating.

4977
02:54:04,890 --> 02:54:07,170
What is going on?

4978
02:54:07,450 --> 02:54:07,490
What?

4979
02:54:07,830 --> 02:54:08,150
Okay.

4980
02:54:08,930 --> 02:54:10,690
Oh my god.

4981
02:54:10,850 --> 02:54:14,350
XShatter is fully swimming on the floor while shooting.

4982
02:54:17,490 --> 02:54:19,950
When they spawn next to you, it's...

4983
02:54:20,650 --> 02:54:22,810
I keep trading with people.

4984
02:54:23,330 --> 02:54:23,730
That's crazy.

4985
02:54:25,170 --> 02:54:26,070
They killed me!

4986
02:54:26,110 --> 02:54:26,250
What?

4987
02:54:26,830 --> 02:54:27,350
I just...

4988
02:54:29,210 --> 02:54:30,570
I'm just...

4989
02:54:30,570 --> 02:54:31,870
I'm just hitting spawn camps.

4990
02:54:31,870 --> 02:54:33,470
Oh, just killed me twice in a row.

4991
02:54:33,550 --> 02:54:34,010
That's crazy.

4992
02:54:34,210 --> 02:54:35,710
I'm just hitting spawn camps.

4993
02:54:35,890 --> 02:54:37,010
Are you serious?

4994
02:54:37,570 --> 02:54:38,230
I can't hit him.

4995
02:54:38,310 --> 02:54:39,590
Okay, I got him.

4996
02:54:40,050 --> 02:54:41,150
I lurk away.

4997
02:54:42,870 --> 02:54:44,170
Oh my god.

4998
02:54:45,110 --> 02:54:46,470
Oh my god.

4999
02:54:46,530 --> 02:54:47,830
I'm gonna freak out.

5000
02:54:47,990 --> 02:54:52,190
I'm actually gonna freak out if I get spawn camped one more time.

5001
02:54:55,630 --> 02:54:57,370
I'm gonna lose it.

5002
02:54:57,610 --> 02:54:59,190
I'm gonna fucking lose it.

5003
02:55:02,510 --> 02:55:03,070
Oh, okay.

5004
02:55:03,450 --> 02:55:05,910
I'm getting absolutely destroyed.

5005
02:55:06,090 --> 02:55:07,050
Oh, she plays very hard.

5006
02:55:07,130 --> 02:55:07,510
That's not fair.

5007
02:55:12,150 --> 02:55:13,930
I'm gonna go to their house.

5008
02:55:14,930 --> 02:55:15,110
What?

5009
02:55:16,230 --> 02:55:18,290
I'm on my way right now.

5010
02:55:22,250 --> 02:55:22,870
Oh, man.

5011
02:55:23,650 --> 02:55:25,090
I didn't even know he existed.

5012
02:55:27,850 --> 02:55:29,030
Oh, we're teamed up.

5013
02:55:29,030 --> 02:55:29,550
We're teamed up.

5014
02:55:29,730 --> 02:55:29,990
We're here.

5015
02:55:30,910 --> 02:55:31,430
Okay,

5016
02:55:39,870 --> 02:55:41,650
I know where people spawn now.

5017
02:55:42,330 --> 02:55:44,190
I just got 360, man.

5018
02:55:44,310 --> 02:55:44,870
Oh my god.

5019
02:55:45,410 --> 02:55:48,070
If I get spawn camp, we all get spawn camp.

5020
02:55:53,050 --> 02:55:55,750
I got 12 kills.

5021
02:55:55,750 --> 02:55:56,930
I got 12.

5022
02:55:57,970 --> 02:56:01,270
I feel like I could have gotten more if I didn't get spawn camp.

5023
02:56:01,430 --> 02:56:02,430
He didn't even have to say it.

5024
02:56:03,570 --> 02:56:05,190
That's the first time I ever told you.

5025
02:56:06,810 --> 02:56:07,890
The leaderboard speaks for itself.

5026
02:56:08,430 --> 02:56:10,490
This is part of the record, bro.

5027
02:56:12,450 --> 02:56:13,830
Honestly, you're kind of right.

5028
02:56:13,910 --> 02:56:14,530
Oh my god.

5029
02:56:14,890 --> 02:56:17,350
I have to pop off on go down.

5030
02:56:17,910 --> 02:56:19,030
I have to walk in on go down.

5031
02:56:19,190 --> 02:56:20,810
This is your game.

5032
02:56:20,810 --> 02:56:24,030
I hope that cam doesn't punch you off or something.

5033
02:56:24,890 --> 02:56:26,250
We're going to win go down.

5034
02:56:26,570 --> 02:56:31,150
I realized that the spawns are the same so you can literally just stay there and spawn camp.

5035
02:56:32,570 --> 02:56:34,150
So that's what I did.

5036
02:56:37,510 --> 02:56:38,270
It's dropper.

5037
02:56:39,770 --> 02:56:41,050
You have limited health.

5038
02:56:41,190 --> 02:56:43,070
You have to get to the bottom and stay alive.

5039
02:56:43,490 --> 02:56:45,610
When you die, you go back to the top.

5040
02:56:45,890 --> 02:56:47,290
When you die, you go back to the top.

5041
02:56:47,350 --> 02:56:47,950
You get nothing.

5042
02:56:47,950 --> 02:56:50,590
If you get to the bottom, you go back to the top and you just play again.

5043
02:56:51,050 --> 02:56:55,830
You can punch other people but it's so not worth it.

5044
02:56:56,130 --> 02:56:57,270
Points wise, it's so not worth it.

5045
02:56:57,370 --> 02:56:58,430
But I kind of want to.

5046
02:57:04,700 --> 02:57:06,060
Come back here, Joel.

5047
02:57:06,680 --> 02:57:07,900
I see you.

5048
02:57:09,200 --> 02:57:09,640
God.

5049
02:57:15,120 --> 02:57:15,880
The karma.

5050
02:57:15,880 --> 02:57:16,700
It's unlucky.

5051
02:57:17,140 --> 02:57:22,520
Oh my god.

5052
02:57:23,520 --> 02:57:24,600
Genuinely targeted.

5053
02:57:25,680 --> 02:57:26,660
That's crazy.

5054
02:57:27,080 --> 02:57:28,940
Change your skin right now.

5055
02:57:29,920 --> 02:57:30,580
It's high.

5056
02:57:34,520 --> 02:57:37,980
You can go pretty far down the first couple layers.

5057
02:57:38,160 --> 02:57:38,780
Yeah, I just found that out.

5058
02:57:38,780 --> 02:57:41,180
Also, when you hit a...

5059
02:57:41,880 --> 02:57:43,160
a new layer...

5060
02:57:43,160 --> 02:57:43,620
Oh god.

5061
02:57:44,040 --> 02:57:45,400
It heals you, right?

5062
02:57:47,660 --> 02:57:48,740
Yeah, it heals you.

5063
02:57:48,860 --> 02:57:49,460
Oh, that's big.

5064
02:57:49,700 --> 02:57:53,860
I made three insane mistakes and it just literally didn't matter at all.

5065
02:57:54,460 --> 02:57:56,060
Yeah, there's a damage reduction.

5066
02:57:57,780 --> 02:57:58,780
Oh, I'm live?

5067
02:57:59,080 --> 02:57:59,500
Okay.

5068
02:58:01,100 --> 02:58:02,380
Oh, Winston health pot.

5069
02:58:02,440 --> 02:58:03,020
Hold on.

5070
02:58:05,360 --> 02:58:06,380
I have a fishing rod.

5071
02:58:06,500 --> 02:58:06,940
Oh my god.

5072
02:58:08,480 --> 02:58:09,940
What's the tech with the fishing rod?

5073
02:58:09,940 --> 02:58:10,480
Oh no!

5074
02:58:11,020 --> 02:58:14,360
You grab somebody from up top and then you drag them and then they're gone.

5075
02:58:14,740 --> 02:58:15,220
Okay.

5076
02:58:15,460 --> 02:58:16,340
Okay, it doesn't reach.

5077
02:58:17,380 --> 02:58:21,000
We were friendly because you guys said it wasn't worth it.

5078
02:58:21,020 --> 02:58:21,500
Oh, I'm dead.

5079
02:58:21,660 --> 02:58:21,740
Okay.

5080
02:58:24,660 --> 02:58:25,500
Hold on.

5081
02:58:30,540 --> 02:58:33,080
I got to pink, but then I died.

5082
02:58:34,220 --> 02:58:35,080
I'm on pink right now.

5083
02:58:35,120 --> 02:58:36,560
Hold on.

5084
02:58:36,560 --> 02:58:37,940
Oh, there's a pig here.

5085
02:58:38,060 --> 02:58:39,080
No, no, no.

5086
02:58:40,340 --> 02:58:41,140
Let's go!

5087
02:58:41,520 --> 02:58:41,980
I did one.

5088
02:58:42,420 --> 02:58:43,280
Wait, I died?

5089
02:58:43,700 --> 02:58:44,120
What?

5090
02:58:46,060 --> 02:58:49,460
Oh, did somebody hit me in the back of the head?

5091
02:58:49,840 --> 02:58:51,020
Oh, I'm so dead.

5092
02:58:51,340 --> 02:58:52,840
Sometimes they do, yeah.

5093
02:58:55,840 --> 02:58:57,420
Oh my god.

5094
02:58:57,740 --> 02:58:58,560
Show Bart.

5095
02:59:00,340 --> 02:59:01,880
People keep hitting me.

5096
02:59:02,680 --> 02:59:03,920
I'm just running it down.

5097
02:59:04,740 --> 02:59:05,620
I didn't do it.

5098
02:59:05,620 --> 02:59:09,060
For the first couple, run it down pretty easily.

5099
02:59:09,480 --> 02:59:10,120
I see a pig.

5100
02:59:10,180 --> 02:59:10,540
Hold on.

5101
02:59:12,640 --> 02:59:14,940
Oh, I'm freaking eagling now.

5102
02:59:15,120 --> 02:59:15,940
Oh my god, I thought I was going to die.

5103
02:59:16,420 --> 02:59:17,980
Dude, dude, dude, who is this?

5104
02:59:18,180 --> 02:59:20,060
Kaboodle's just swinging my ass on the checkpoint.

5105
02:59:20,300 --> 02:59:20,480
Hello?

5106
02:59:23,720 --> 02:59:24,240
I'm alive.

5107
02:59:24,420 --> 02:59:24,980
Fuck you.

5108
02:59:25,680 --> 02:59:26,800
Oh, I fumble.

5109
02:59:26,980 --> 02:59:27,480
Fumble nation.

5110
02:59:27,720 --> 02:59:28,580
Fumble nation is so bad.

5111
02:59:29,120 --> 02:59:31,860
I couldn't get to the pink.

5112
02:59:32,960 --> 02:59:34,180
I did two laps.

5113
02:59:34,280 --> 02:59:34,940
Did I even do three?

5114
02:59:35,440 --> 02:59:37,100
Bro, I didn't even get to the bottom.

5115
02:59:37,780 --> 02:59:39,200
I did one lap.

5116
02:59:39,220 --> 02:59:40,360
I didn't even do a lap.

5117
02:59:41,200 --> 02:59:42,760
I was so close.

5118
02:59:42,880 --> 02:59:43,540
I got to the pink.

5119
02:59:43,600 --> 02:59:45,040
And then I got beat off.

5120
02:59:45,680 --> 02:59:45,960
Yeah.

5121
02:59:48,520 --> 02:59:49,300
It's time.

5122
02:59:49,520 --> 02:59:51,200
We'll see if we did good, guys.

5123
02:59:52,040 --> 02:59:53,840
I got beat off.

5124
02:59:55,780 --> 02:59:58,380
It's possible we could not be first.

5125
02:59:58,520 --> 02:59:59,640
It is technically possible.

5126
02:59:59,640 --> 03:00:01,760
Because I did absolute shit.

5127
03:00:01,940 --> 03:00:04,760
I had the best party performance that has ever been seen ever.

5128
03:00:05,120 --> 03:00:07,000
Yeah, but I like balanced it out.

5129
03:00:17,440 --> 03:00:21,060
It's cooked if I don't even get called on this leaderboard, I'm not going to lie.

5130
03:00:22,620 --> 03:00:23,360
I don't even care.

5131
03:00:23,520 --> 03:00:24,160
It's no big deal.

5132
03:00:24,720 --> 03:00:25,720
Yeah, I don't care.

5133
03:00:25,720 --> 03:00:27,140
Yeah, yeah.

5134
03:00:27,280 --> 03:00:28,560
We don't care.

5135
03:00:29,520 --> 03:00:30,640
It's no big deal.

5136
03:00:31,660 --> 03:00:32,100
Yeah.

5137
03:00:33,820 --> 03:00:34,340
Cheers.

5138
03:00:36,600 --> 03:00:37,120
Whatever.

5139
03:00:37,560 --> 03:00:38,880
Yeah, whatever.

5140
03:00:39,900 --> 03:00:41,120
Okay, that's good.

5141
03:00:41,320 --> 03:00:42,740
I only dropped two.

5142
03:00:43,120 --> 03:00:43,580
That's fine.

5143
03:00:48,770 --> 03:00:49,730
Alright, alright.

5144
03:00:49,790 --> 03:00:49,990
Damn.

5145
03:00:53,250 --> 03:00:54,330
Shatter went crazy.

5146
03:00:55,230 --> 03:00:56,370
I'm not going to look at them.

5147
03:00:56,370 --> 03:00:57,630
They don't deserve my...

5148
03:01:01,710 --> 03:01:04,550
Why do you keep inviting me back, man?

5149
03:01:04,610 --> 03:01:06,830
How do you keep getting away with it?

5150
03:01:07,450 --> 03:01:07,650
What?

5151
03:01:08,410 --> 03:01:09,670
How do I keep getting away with it?

5152
03:01:10,630 --> 03:01:11,790
This is just endive.

5153
03:01:11,850 --> 03:01:14,170
Now onto the leaderboards.

5154
03:01:14,470 --> 03:01:15,450
We crushed team.

5155
03:01:17,090 --> 03:01:18,190
We crushed team.

5156
03:01:19,350 --> 03:01:22,390
Well, that's until I got no points in one of the games.

5157
03:01:23,230 --> 03:01:24,430
We crushed team.

5158
03:01:25,330 --> 03:01:26,390
That gap is crazy.

5159
03:01:27,610 --> 03:01:28,590
Oh my god.

5160
03:01:28,830 --> 03:01:31,870
I can't even not look at it if I wanted to.

5161
03:01:32,490 --> 03:01:33,690
Wait, this is close.

5162
03:01:33,970 --> 03:01:36,150
It's so crazy for a lime, right?

5163
03:01:36,250 --> 03:01:36,810
Fruit should in.

5164
03:01:37,990 --> 03:01:38,750
It's red.

5165
03:01:38,870 --> 03:01:39,790
It's either red or...

5166
03:01:39,790 --> 03:01:40,710
This is so close.

5167
03:01:42,290 --> 03:01:42,770
Gulp.

5168
03:01:44,310 --> 03:01:45,250
Red or purple?

5169
03:01:46,370 --> 03:01:47,770
I think red did the most.

5170
03:01:47,790 --> 03:01:48,650
We're gonna be fine.

5171
03:01:48,650 --> 03:01:50,090
Alright.

5172
03:01:50,190 --> 03:01:51,010
Yay!

5173
03:01:52,850 --> 03:01:54,290
That's us!

5174
03:01:54,890 --> 03:01:56,110
We get to play Valorant.

5175
03:01:56,490 --> 03:01:57,770
We get to play Valorant.

5176
03:01:58,270 --> 03:01:58,750
Let's go.

5177
03:02:00,310 --> 03:02:01,130
We're in first!

5178
03:02:02,630 --> 03:02:03,930
We were.

5179
03:02:04,250 --> 03:02:05,850
Wait a minute.

5180
03:02:05,910 --> 03:02:06,790
Oh my god.

5181
03:02:08,480 --> 03:02:09,810
We got first.

5182
03:02:10,790 --> 03:02:11,810
Fun fact.

5183
03:02:12,490 --> 03:02:14,510
Red team has two Valorant players.

5184
03:02:14,510 --> 03:02:15,010
Okay.

5185
03:02:16,730 --> 03:02:18,330
I'm also a Valorant player.

5186
03:02:18,670 --> 03:02:20,210
I'm an Apex player.

5187
03:02:20,470 --> 03:02:21,490
Slash Overwatch player.

5188
03:02:21,750 --> 03:02:23,750
But I don't know how this game works.

5189
03:02:24,410 --> 03:02:27,230
They have two Valorant players.

5190
03:02:27,410 --> 03:02:28,310
A Minecraft player.

5191
03:02:29,010 --> 03:02:30,310
A Fortnite player.

5192
03:02:30,810 --> 03:02:32,230
And an osu!

5193
03:02:32,270 --> 03:02:32,430
player.

5194
03:02:33,110 --> 03:02:34,330
I'm 0 for 2 on this game.

5195
03:02:34,570 --> 03:02:35,790
So, I don't know what to do.

5196
03:02:36,270 --> 03:02:36,970
I'm sorry.

5197
03:02:37,710 --> 03:02:38,490
We just gotta shoot them.

5198
03:02:39,430 --> 03:02:40,810
How do you play this?

5199
03:02:40,810 --> 03:02:42,970
This is the one game I didn't read.

5200
03:02:43,450 --> 03:02:44,870
When you shoot someone, they get frozen.

5201
03:02:46,290 --> 03:02:47,530
That's like the main thing here.

5202
03:02:47,650 --> 03:02:49,010
So, you wanna just tap people.

5203
03:02:49,450 --> 03:02:50,450
Oh, is this freeze tag?

5204
03:02:51,210 --> 03:02:51,510
Yeah.

5205
03:02:52,130 --> 03:02:53,710
It should show in the tutorial.

5206
03:02:54,950 --> 03:02:56,010
Yeah, there's a charge.

5207
03:02:56,150 --> 03:02:57,390
You pick it up, you plant it.

5208
03:02:58,330 --> 03:03:00,810
Getting it planted early seems to be really important.

5209
03:03:01,270 --> 03:03:02,910
It takes a while to break it too.

5210
03:03:03,030 --> 03:03:05,690
So, if you can find a little corner to peek around to break it, it's good.

5211
03:03:05,750 --> 03:03:07,650
Because otherwise, they'll just find you and bam, you're done.

5212
03:03:09,030 --> 03:03:10,430
Alright, does anyone know the corners?

5213
03:03:10,630 --> 03:03:11,510
Does anyone know that?

5214
03:03:12,190 --> 03:03:13,350
I am not the plant.

5215
03:03:13,470 --> 03:03:14,510
I can't do the planting.

5216
03:03:14,750 --> 03:03:16,170
I don't know how to plant either.

5217
03:03:16,450 --> 03:03:19,070
I think Fine should do it since he's actually played this before.

5218
03:03:19,370 --> 03:03:21,450
Alright, Fine, you can't.

5219
03:03:21,470 --> 03:03:22,290
I'll do whatever, man.

5220
03:03:22,350 --> 03:03:23,890
I don't know how to play this.

5221
03:03:26,690 --> 03:03:27,830
See ya, Tom.

5222
03:03:30,250 --> 03:03:32,110
I don't even know what's good to start as, even.

5223
03:03:32,950 --> 03:03:34,010
Wait, there's like classes?

5224
03:03:34,990 --> 03:03:36,510
Well, you just start as attacker, defense.

5225
03:03:36,510 --> 03:03:37,290
Oh, okay.

5226
03:03:37,810 --> 03:03:39,350
Is this attacker or D-sided?

5227
03:03:40,330 --> 03:03:41,390
I don't know.

5228
03:03:41,990 --> 03:03:43,830
Alright, Wolfie, let us know as the organizer.

5229
03:03:43,990 --> 03:03:44,550
Is this attacker?

5230
03:03:44,730 --> 03:03:45,130
Is this D-sided?

5231
03:03:45,130 --> 03:03:46,190
I don't know.

5232
03:03:48,010 --> 03:03:49,470
We have the charge, so we're planting.

5233
03:03:49,810 --> 03:03:51,330
Oh, no, we get to choose.

5234
03:03:52,250 --> 03:03:54,150
Attack maybe on start?

5235
03:03:54,210 --> 03:03:54,850
I'm not sure.

5236
03:03:57,170 --> 03:03:59,890
Defense was really good, but I don't know how good it is now.

5237
03:04:00,930 --> 03:04:01,310
Yeah.

5238
03:04:01,870 --> 03:04:03,610
Yeah, there's a heart over their head and you like...

5239
03:04:03,610 --> 03:04:06,130
Yeah, I'm gonna lock attack.

5240
03:04:07,030 --> 03:04:08,350
Just cause I don't know, man.

5241
03:04:10,150 --> 03:04:10,970
Are you locking attack?

5242
03:04:10,990 --> 03:04:11,430
Rush B!

5243
03:04:11,590 --> 03:04:12,330
Rush B!

5244
03:04:12,730 --> 03:04:13,910
Oh, that's B!

5245
03:04:14,030 --> 03:04:14,190
Okay.

5246
03:04:14,850 --> 03:04:15,790
Yeah, I'm down to rush B.

5247
03:04:16,410 --> 03:04:18,170
It's closer, it looks like, maybe.

5248
03:04:19,970 --> 03:04:20,570
Uh, maybe.

5249
03:04:21,150 --> 03:04:22,710
We have pretty quick access to it.

5250
03:04:23,310 --> 03:04:24,490
I'm gonna try to flank.

5251
03:04:24,530 --> 03:04:26,030
I'm gonna try to flank through mid.

5252
03:04:26,130 --> 03:04:26,790
Wait, but who's planting?

5253
03:04:26,930 --> 03:04:27,870
I'm gonna try to flank through mid.

5254
03:04:27,950 --> 03:04:28,750
Everyone should go B.

5255
03:04:28,830 --> 03:04:29,390
Wolfie, you can plant.

5256
03:04:29,730 --> 03:04:29,990
Okay.

5257
03:04:30,510 --> 03:04:30,990
Sorry.

5258
03:04:31,450 --> 03:04:32,190
Wait, but Wolfie...

5259
03:04:32,190 --> 03:04:35,250
I was gonna say...

5260
03:04:35,250 --> 03:04:36,750
I'm gonna plant over here.

5261
03:04:37,910 --> 03:04:39,170
This sprint is weird.

5262
03:04:39,510 --> 03:04:41,930
3, 3, 3, 3 rotating, 3 rotating, 3 rotating.

5263
03:04:45,170 --> 03:04:45,910
Got one.

5264
03:04:46,690 --> 03:04:47,910
Crazy pre-fire, by the way.

5265
03:04:48,010 --> 03:04:48,470
2 more rotating.

5266
03:04:49,590 --> 03:04:50,510
Oh, behind us.

5267
03:04:51,830 --> 03:04:53,590
Far flank, Shane's far flanking.

5268
03:04:55,090 --> 03:04:55,770
That's insane.

5269
03:04:56,710 --> 03:04:57,510
He was so good.

5270
03:04:58,190 --> 03:04:58,550
Nice.

5271
03:04:58,850 --> 03:05:00,230
Maybe defusing, Wolfie?

5272
03:05:00,870 --> 03:05:01,910
No, no, no, not defusing.

5273
03:05:02,750 --> 03:05:03,450
Good trade.

5274
03:05:04,390 --> 03:05:04,750
Nice!

5275
03:05:06,890 --> 03:05:08,910
Just play for bomb, play for bomb if you can.

5276
03:05:10,930 --> 03:05:12,950
Yeah, just wait for them to try and get the charge.

5277
03:05:15,090 --> 03:05:16,390
They're coming in now, on site.

5278
03:05:16,670 --> 03:05:17,010
Nice!

5279
03:05:19,510 --> 03:05:20,110
Let's go!

5280
03:05:21,610 --> 03:05:27,130
I forgot it was one shot because I saw all my hearts and I was like, I have plenty time to live.

5281
03:05:28,530 --> 03:05:29,990
Are we rushing B again?

5282
03:05:30,990 --> 03:05:31,870
Yeah, I'll do the same thing.

5283
03:05:33,630 --> 03:05:35,270
They'll probably expect it, but that's true.

5284
03:05:36,810 --> 03:05:37,950
I'm just gonna do it differently.

5285
03:05:38,290 --> 03:05:39,950
But you got the charge down so fast on B.

5286
03:05:40,450 --> 03:05:42,870
Yeah, I try to not plant it at the corner.

5287
03:05:48,290 --> 03:05:49,650
There's one in front, right in front of you.

5288
03:05:51,230 --> 03:05:51,850
Got him.

5289
03:05:53,170 --> 03:05:53,750
Got him.

5290
03:05:54,050 --> 03:05:54,370
Nice.

5291
03:05:54,870 --> 03:05:55,830
Three down on site.

5292
03:05:55,830 --> 03:05:57,010
Is there fall damage or no?

5293
03:05:57,150 --> 03:05:59,070
It's just Shane on me, it's just Shane on me in the corner.

5294
03:05:59,190 --> 03:05:59,770
I'm just time stalling.

5295
03:06:00,330 --> 03:06:01,710
I'm coming for flank.

5296
03:06:05,090 --> 03:06:07,750
I got him, I got him, I got him.

5297
03:06:08,070 --> 03:06:08,670
Nice, nice, nice.

5298
03:06:11,970 --> 03:06:12,670
Holy moly.

5299
03:06:13,030 --> 03:06:14,250
Okay, we're defending now.

5300
03:06:16,830 --> 03:06:17,630
Go B!

5301
03:06:17,850 --> 03:06:18,930
Go B, go rush B!

5302
03:06:19,970 --> 03:06:21,390
He split surely, right?

5303
03:06:22,350 --> 03:06:23,830
I can maybe go mid.

5304
03:06:24,290 --> 03:06:26,390
Maybe we can have one A and then I'll B.

5305
03:06:26,610 --> 03:06:26,950
I'll go A, I'll go A.

5306
03:06:27,470 --> 03:06:29,090
Two split, two A, two B.

5307
03:06:29,290 --> 03:06:29,910
I'll go B.

5308
03:06:30,370 --> 03:06:31,550
I'll go A too then.

5309
03:06:32,110 --> 03:06:32,830
I'll go B.

5310
03:06:38,020 --> 03:06:39,240
I don't know where they're going.

5311
03:06:39,380 --> 03:06:40,120
I don't know if they saw me.

5312
03:06:41,720 --> 03:06:42,120
They saw me.

5313
03:06:42,380 --> 03:06:43,280
They're B, they're B.

5314
03:06:46,220 --> 03:06:47,140
One down mid.

5315
03:06:47,760 --> 03:06:49,160
I'm down mid, that was not a great play.

5316
03:06:49,240 --> 03:06:50,880
Close on the wall, close on your wall.

5317
03:06:52,500 --> 03:06:52,860
Nice.

5318
03:06:52,900 --> 03:06:53,720
Nice trade, nice trade.

5319
03:06:54,980 --> 03:06:56,300
They're rezzing mid.

5320
03:06:56,460 --> 03:06:58,120
You should fight on the site right now.

5321
03:06:58,260 --> 03:06:58,860
I'm trying to get bomb A.

5322
03:07:00,280 --> 03:07:00,980
That's hard, that's hard.

5323
03:07:02,600 --> 03:07:03,460
I think attack was good.

5324
03:07:04,240 --> 03:07:05,800
I don't think mid is the play.

5325
03:07:06,700 --> 03:07:09,800
I don't think we need mid because there's only two points anyway.

5326
03:07:10,200 --> 03:07:11,320
Mid is just for location.

5327
03:07:12,080 --> 03:07:13,080
I was going to go for flank.

5328
03:07:13,380 --> 03:07:16,420
You can play mid and just watch them trying to flank us.

5329
03:07:16,940 --> 03:07:18,720
I'm going to go B, I'm going to go B.

5330
03:07:18,940 --> 03:07:19,540
I'll watch mid.

5331
03:07:19,540 --> 03:07:21,540
I'm rushing it.

5332
03:07:21,680 --> 03:07:23,640
This is attack sided, heavily.

5333
03:07:24,380 --> 03:07:24,800
I think.

5334
03:07:25,200 --> 03:07:27,200
I think they're going A.

5335
03:07:28,020 --> 03:07:29,100
B, I see two B.

5336
03:07:29,260 --> 03:07:29,980
Nevermind, I lied.

5337
03:07:30,340 --> 03:07:31,620
I spread misinformation on the internet.

5338
03:07:34,340 --> 03:07:35,780
Yeah, I'll come over to B.

5339
03:07:38,740 --> 03:07:39,680
Let's just take the fight.

5340
03:07:40,740 --> 03:07:41,640
They're not on site.

5341
03:07:42,280 --> 03:07:43,020
They planted the bomb.

5342
03:07:43,240 --> 03:07:44,420
I traded.

5343
03:07:45,640 --> 03:07:46,420
Yeah, they did plant.

5344
03:07:46,520 --> 03:07:46,940
I traded.

5345
03:07:48,280 --> 03:07:49,520
Where's the other team?

5346
03:07:49,900 --> 03:07:50,880
Wait, where's the other team?

5347
03:07:51,120 --> 03:07:52,860
Hold me, hold me, hold me.

5348
03:07:52,960 --> 03:07:54,340
Behind, behind, behind.

5349
03:07:55,780 --> 03:07:56,740
I just...

5350
03:07:57,700 --> 03:07:59,400
Bomb, bomb, maybe last.

5351
03:08:00,120 --> 03:08:01,280
I'm going around the corner.

5352
03:08:01,540 --> 03:08:02,080
To your left, Doki.

5353
03:08:03,440 --> 03:08:04,360
Oh my god.

5354
03:08:04,620 --> 03:08:06,860
I don't know the chart for this.

5355
03:08:07,880 --> 03:08:08,260
Nice.

5356
03:08:09,280 --> 03:08:09,760
Diffuse.

5357
03:08:10,140 --> 03:08:11,900
Just hold it down.

5358
03:08:13,220 --> 03:08:14,940
I didn't know you had the...

5359
03:08:14,940 --> 03:08:16,660
What was it?

5360
03:08:17,120 --> 03:08:18,680
The charge up of the bomb?

5361
03:08:19,460 --> 03:08:20,620
Did we even kill all five?

5362
03:08:20,680 --> 03:08:21,420
I guess we did.

5363
03:08:21,820 --> 03:08:23,700
I guess we did, yeah.

5364
03:08:25,940 --> 03:08:27,660
Yeah, you have to get the charge up.

5365
03:08:27,800 --> 03:08:31,100
The chat's so weird because it overlaps between rounds.

5366
03:08:31,200 --> 03:08:31,580
You know what I mean?

5367
03:08:32,840 --> 03:08:34,440
Are we attacking now?

5368
03:08:34,540 --> 03:08:36,140
Yeah, we are.

5369
03:08:36,740 --> 03:08:37,480
Can we go A?

5370
03:08:37,620 --> 03:08:38,760
Because everyone's been going B.

5371
03:08:38,860 --> 03:08:39,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5372
03:08:40,740 --> 03:08:43,080
I can go to B just to bait them.

5373
03:08:43,080 --> 03:08:44,400
I'll bait on B.

5374
03:08:44,680 --> 03:08:44,920
Oh, you bait?

5375
03:08:44,940 --> 03:08:45,260
Okay.

5376
03:08:47,320 --> 03:08:49,040
Do we wait then on A or no?

5377
03:08:49,240 --> 03:08:50,360
No, no, just plant instantly.

5378
03:08:51,340 --> 03:08:54,660
I'm going to plant at a really bad spot.

5379
03:08:54,680 --> 03:08:57,080
I don't know this spot though, so...

5380
03:08:58,160 --> 03:08:59,320
Two flank, two flank, two flank.

5381
03:08:59,440 --> 03:09:00,460
One more flank, one more flank.

5382
03:09:00,700 --> 03:09:01,720
Resing the bodies, resing the bodies.

5383
03:09:01,920 --> 03:09:02,900
Two more flank, two more flank.

5384
03:09:03,480 --> 03:09:06,500
All three flank, all three flanking.

5385
03:09:06,840 --> 03:09:09,300
All five flanking, all five now up and flanking.

5386
03:09:09,460 --> 03:09:10,320
Maybe splitting up now.

5387
03:09:10,320 --> 03:09:12,040
All five back there, all five.

5388
03:09:13,640 --> 03:09:14,160
Okay, I see one.

5389
03:09:14,840 --> 03:09:16,120
Right here, right here.

5390
03:09:16,220 --> 03:09:17,140
On the bomb, on the bomb, on the bomb.

5391
03:09:17,980 --> 03:09:18,340
Yep.

5392
03:09:21,760 --> 03:09:22,600
Nice, good trades.

5393
03:09:22,980 --> 03:09:23,360
Oh, empty.

5394
03:09:24,220 --> 03:09:24,500
On me.

5395
03:09:25,500 --> 03:09:27,440
Nice trades, 2v2, 1v2.

5396
03:09:29,100 --> 03:09:30,500
On site, on site, on site.

5397
03:09:30,540 --> 03:09:31,940
Nice try, nice try.

5398
03:09:32,560 --> 03:09:33,060
Yeah, yeah.

5399
03:09:34,500 --> 03:09:36,440
Dude, I held flank and they were just like...

5400
03:09:37,900 --> 03:09:39,860
I got the first shot.

5401
03:09:40,160 --> 03:09:41,020
I think we should go B now after that.

5402
03:09:41,200 --> 03:09:42,120
I think so.

5403
03:09:42,600 --> 03:09:43,280
I think we swap.

5404
03:09:43,460 --> 03:09:46,580
I think we know B better than A.

5405
03:09:47,040 --> 03:09:48,340
Oh, we're defending, we're defending.

5406
03:09:48,540 --> 03:09:48,940
Oh, we're defending?

5407
03:09:49,220 --> 03:09:49,440
Okay.

5408
03:09:49,760 --> 03:09:50,860
Oh, it swaps 1-1-1?

5409
03:09:50,980 --> 03:09:51,440
Sure, sure, sure.

5410
03:09:52,460 --> 03:09:53,500
I'll go B then.

5411
03:09:54,260 --> 03:09:54,620
I'll go A.

5412
03:09:55,440 --> 03:09:57,300
They're just pre-firing by the way.

5413
03:09:57,380 --> 03:09:58,500
They're not even aiming anymore.

5414
03:09:59,420 --> 03:10:00,580
I noticed that.

5415
03:10:03,060 --> 03:10:03,840
I'll watch mid.

5416
03:10:04,560 --> 03:10:06,440
I think B is easier to attack.

5417
03:10:07,660 --> 03:10:08,660
It really is.

5418
03:10:09,260 --> 03:10:09,640
Uh-huh.

5419
03:10:13,360 --> 03:10:14,700
Uh, one mid.

5420
03:10:15,100 --> 03:10:16,680
I see them, I see them, I see them.

5421
03:10:16,800 --> 03:10:17,940
They're B, they're B, they're B.

5422
03:10:18,100 --> 03:10:19,180
They're pre-firing my area.

5423
03:10:19,180 --> 03:10:19,800
One is mid.

5424
03:10:21,480 --> 03:10:22,020
Got one.

5425
03:10:23,860 --> 03:10:25,040
One's on top of the spike.

5426
03:10:25,380 --> 03:10:27,160
There's three, there's three on B.

5427
03:10:28,980 --> 03:10:30,080
Oh, oh, one got me.

5428
03:10:31,160 --> 03:10:31,300
Alright.

5429
03:10:32,380 --> 03:10:34,480
Woah, woah, woah, one is in their spawn.

5430
03:10:34,480 --> 03:10:34,880
Hello?

5431
03:10:35,520 --> 03:10:35,940
Jesus.

5432
03:10:36,340 --> 03:10:38,220
There's two right where I'm shooting right here.

5433
03:10:38,440 --> 03:10:40,420
One's in their spawn, on you Doki, on your right.

5434
03:10:40,940 --> 03:10:41,320
How do I rez?

5435
03:10:41,560 --> 03:10:41,980
How do I rez?

5436
03:10:44,340 --> 03:10:45,780
Oh no, I didn't know how to rez.

5437
03:10:47,180 --> 03:10:48,200
Is there one left?

5438
03:10:48,840 --> 03:10:50,140
Last one was on...

5439
03:10:50,140 --> 03:10:50,720
Yeah, there's one.

5440
03:10:51,620 --> 03:10:54,340
I didn't know how to rez, so...

5441
03:10:54,340 --> 03:10:55,600
I was trying to cover.

5442
03:10:56,380 --> 03:10:57,100
It's okay, it's okay.

5443
03:10:58,120 --> 03:11:00,540
I think we push B, fight B.

5444
03:11:00,580 --> 03:11:01,260
Yeah, just fight B.

5445
03:11:01,900 --> 03:11:03,160
Do we do overtime?

5446
03:11:04,040 --> 03:11:04,980
This is overtime.

5447
03:11:05,280 --> 03:11:06,540
This is the last one.

5448
03:11:07,720 --> 03:11:09,000
Push B, push B.

5449
03:11:11,940 --> 03:11:12,680
That's crazy.

5450
03:11:12,820 --> 03:11:14,360
I'll try to hold mid.

5451
03:11:14,600 --> 03:11:15,240
Very passive.

5452
03:11:17,260 --> 03:11:18,360
Yeah, I think we have to play passive.

5453
03:11:18,480 --> 03:11:19,540
I don't think we should flank anymore.

5454
03:11:20,600 --> 03:11:21,740
We have everybody here.

5455
03:11:21,820 --> 03:11:23,700
I'm gonna hold their flank, if anything.

5456
03:11:26,020 --> 03:11:28,060
We're starting fights as a 3v4.

5457
03:11:29,340 --> 03:11:30,020
On me.

5458
03:11:30,240 --> 03:11:31,240
On bomb.

5459
03:11:31,880 --> 03:11:32,360
Diffusing.

5460
03:11:34,040 --> 03:11:35,300
Diffusing in the corner.

5461
03:11:35,960 --> 03:11:36,720
Did you get him?

5462
03:11:37,940 --> 03:11:38,880
Nice, Feinberg.

5463
03:11:40,000 --> 03:11:40,960
I got...

5464
03:11:40,960 --> 03:11:42,540
One behind you.

5465
03:11:42,980 --> 03:11:43,940
One on site.

5466
03:11:45,160 --> 03:11:46,320
On that dark oak.

5467
03:11:47,640 --> 03:11:49,100
You can try to rez me, maybe?

5468
03:11:49,580 --> 03:11:50,600
You don't have to push.

5469
03:11:51,260 --> 03:11:53,040
Just keep them from getting charged.

5470
03:11:53,120 --> 03:11:54,320
I'll tell you if I see them getting charged.

5471
03:11:55,120 --> 03:11:56,320
You can try and rez.

5472
03:11:57,680 --> 03:11:58,280
Maybe not.

5473
03:11:59,760 --> 03:12:00,540
They're still around that box.

5474
03:12:00,760 --> 03:12:01,580
Can they rez?

5475
03:12:01,720 --> 03:12:03,400
Do they have any bodies on them?

5476
03:12:03,500 --> 03:12:04,140
I don't think so, right?

5477
03:12:05,420 --> 03:12:06,220
Zucky, just play time.

5478
03:12:06,860 --> 03:12:07,640
Still around that box.

5479
03:12:08,640 --> 03:12:09,860
Still around that box.

5480
03:12:11,140 --> 03:12:12,020
On spike.

5481
03:12:12,320 --> 03:12:14,280
Fake, fake, fake.

5482
03:12:15,920 --> 03:12:16,360
Faking.

5483
03:12:16,920 --> 03:12:17,880
Fake, fake, fake.

5484
03:12:18,820 --> 03:12:20,020
Push out, push out, push out.

5485
03:12:20,020 --> 03:12:20,500
You win.

5486
03:12:20,500 --> 03:12:22,480
You're fine, you're fine, you're fine.

5487
03:12:22,560 --> 03:12:23,160
Push, push, push, push.

5488
03:12:23,480 --> 03:12:23,980
He's pushing you!

5489
03:12:24,900 --> 03:12:26,040
I'm pre-fired.

5490
03:12:28,320 --> 03:12:29,800
He's pre-fired!

5491
03:12:31,340 --> 03:12:31,620
No!

5492
03:12:33,860 --> 03:12:34,700
Let's go!

5493
03:12:34,720 --> 03:12:35,920
I pre-fired that.

5494
03:12:38,020 --> 03:12:38,860
Huge clutch.

5495
03:12:41,000 --> 03:12:41,940
Let's go.

5496
03:12:44,860 --> 03:12:45,500
Jesus.

5497
03:12:46,240 --> 03:12:47,180
Good job.

5498
03:12:47,180 --> 03:12:48,540
Oh my god.

5499
03:12:48,600 --> 03:12:50,260
I don't think he even showed up on my screen.

5500
03:12:50,440 --> 03:12:51,680
It was just a good pre-fire.

5501
03:12:51,860 --> 03:12:52,220
Oh my god.

5502
03:12:52,940 --> 03:12:53,760
Oh my god.

5503
03:12:55,800 --> 03:12:56,320
Yeah!

5504
03:12:57,480 --> 03:12:58,280
Let's go!

5505
03:12:59,180 --> 03:13:00,300
Thank you, Raid.

5506
03:13:00,380 --> 03:13:03,600
This is my first time playing Black Wars.

5507
03:13:04,500 --> 03:13:05,920
Thank you, Raid.

5508
03:13:06,040 --> 03:13:07,640
This is my second time!

5509
03:13:11,520 --> 03:13:12,980
Wolfie and I played a lot.

5510
03:13:12,980 --> 03:13:13,120
Dude.

5511
03:13:14,620 --> 03:13:17,000
This is the second time I even made Finale.

5512
03:13:18,240 --> 03:13:18,880
Huge win.

5513
03:13:20,120 --> 03:13:21,260
Let's go!

5514
03:13:23,160 --> 03:13:23,800
Enormous.

5515
03:13:26,060 --> 03:13:29,460
And then I never played Black Wars to be undefeated.

5516
03:13:36,740 --> 03:13:38,320
I want to see the leaderboard.

5517
03:13:38,880 --> 03:13:39,840
Let's go!

5518
03:13:41,600 --> 03:13:42,400
Winner POV.

5519
03:13:42,740 --> 03:13:44,380
It didn't matter that you trolled, man.

5520
03:13:44,500 --> 03:13:46,000
I'm telling you, it didn't matter that you trolled, man.

5521
03:13:50,260 --> 03:13:56,420
How do I get off this thing?

5522
03:13:56,580 --> 03:13:57,300
Yeah, how do we get off?

5523
03:13:57,400 --> 03:13:58,180
Guys, I don't want to leave.

5524
03:13:59,000 --> 03:14:00,520
Go through the back.

5525
03:14:01,900 --> 03:14:02,260
Oh, nice.

5526
03:14:02,980 --> 03:14:04,820
Please, I don't want to leave.

5527
03:14:05,060 --> 03:14:06,260
Exit stage left.

5528
03:14:06,260 --> 03:14:08,000
I'm stuck there forever.

5529
03:14:10,520 --> 03:14:11,700
First win for sure.

5530
03:14:11,960 --> 03:14:12,540
Team picture.

5531
03:14:13,880 --> 03:14:15,100
We should go back on the platform.

5532
03:14:15,640 --> 03:14:16,620
Get back on the platform.

5533
03:14:17,360 --> 03:14:19,180
Can you go back?

5534
03:14:19,260 --> 03:14:19,840
I'm lost.

5535
03:14:21,120 --> 03:14:22,160
We can.

5536
03:14:23,240 --> 03:14:23,960
I'm back here.

5537
03:14:26,680 --> 03:14:27,320
I'm lost.

5538
03:14:27,680 --> 03:14:31,060
What's the POV to make it so you're a third person?

5539
03:14:31,660 --> 03:14:32,080
F5.

5540
03:14:32,980 --> 03:14:34,880
How do I get back there?

5541
03:14:34,880 --> 03:14:36,880
Get back there.

5542
03:14:38,340 --> 03:14:39,440
Look at us.

5543
03:14:39,920 --> 03:14:41,120
Look at us.

5544
03:14:41,140 --> 03:14:42,700
I'm like a real Minecraft YouTuber.

5545
03:14:43,960 --> 03:14:45,440
We're Minecrafters now.

5546
03:14:45,980 --> 03:14:46,620
What's up, guys?

5547
03:14:47,120 --> 03:14:49,440
I have a barrier block in my way.

5548
03:14:53,160 --> 03:14:54,100
Awkwardly in the back.

5549
03:14:55,180 --> 03:14:55,960
Photos, guys.

5550
03:14:57,740 --> 03:14:58,260
Cheese.

5551
03:14:58,640 --> 03:15:00,360
We all did it.

5552
03:15:02,220 --> 03:15:03,100
Let's go.

5553
03:15:03,100 --> 03:15:03,960
That was fun.

5554
03:15:05,680 --> 03:15:07,640
Incredible team games at the start.

5555
03:15:07,900 --> 03:15:10,200
A 1k gap after two games.

5556
03:15:10,200 --> 03:15:13,280
Thanks for holding my hand throughout that.

5557
03:15:13,420 --> 03:15:14,300
That was...

5558
03:15:17,480 --> 03:15:19,760
I can't believe we did it.

5559
03:15:20,420 --> 03:15:20,700
Let's go.

5560
03:15:21,020 --> 03:15:23,280
Team game start was good for the mentality.

5561
03:15:23,540 --> 03:15:24,680
We had the winner mindset.

5562
03:15:25,100 --> 03:15:25,360
Yeah.

5563
03:15:26,380 --> 03:15:28,540
We had such a huge lead that we knew...

5564
03:15:29,100 --> 03:15:30,360
It was manifested.

5565
03:15:31,980 --> 03:15:33,020
GGs, everybody.

5566
03:15:33,140 --> 03:15:33,880
I had a great time.

5567
03:15:33,920 --> 03:15:36,540
Thank you for inviting me to participate.

5568
03:15:37,360 --> 03:15:38,280
That was great.

5569
03:15:38,780 --> 03:15:39,880
I'd love to do it again.

5570
03:15:40,760 --> 03:15:42,780
Now that I know the race.

5571
03:15:45,840 --> 03:15:48,380
I won't pause and turn around.

5572
03:15:50,820 --> 03:15:52,780
You should have seen my POV.

5573
03:15:52,920 --> 03:15:54,180
Where did everybody go?

5574
03:15:54,260 --> 03:15:55,740
I literally walked backwards.

5575
03:15:59,400 --> 03:16:00,380
GGs, guys.

5576
03:16:00,640 --> 03:16:01,160
GGs.

5577
03:16:02,120 --> 03:16:04,300
Great playing with all of you guys.

5578
03:16:04,500 --> 03:16:05,340
Of course.

5579
03:16:05,840 --> 03:16:08,100
It was super fun.

5580
03:16:08,580 --> 03:16:11,300
I love the high energy.

5581
03:16:13,900 --> 03:16:16,880
Even when you fucked up the bank thing.

5582
03:16:16,980 --> 03:16:18,040
We still did it.

5583
03:16:20,360 --> 03:16:22,980
I'm pretty sure I picked up your stuff.

5584
03:16:23,060 --> 03:16:24,320
Did you die with four emeralds?

5585
03:16:24,580 --> 03:16:25,180
Yeah.

5586
03:16:25,180 --> 03:16:27,040
I died top layer.

5587
03:16:27,200 --> 03:16:29,120
I'm pretty sure I picked up someone's stuff.

5588
03:16:29,120 --> 03:16:31,200
Technically, your stuff contributed.

5589
03:16:32,840 --> 03:16:34,560
You can take like a hundred on my end.

5590
03:16:38,540 --> 03:16:39,600
GGs, everybody.

5591
03:16:39,780 --> 03:16:41,740
I'm going to go talk to my chat now.

5592
03:16:42,220 --> 03:16:44,600
Have a great rest of your day.

5593
03:16:46,800 --> 03:16:48,300
What is it, Goomy?

5594
03:16:48,560 --> 03:16:51,000
Can we play Liar's Bar, please?

5595
03:16:51,080 --> 03:16:51,620
Right now?

5596
03:16:52,400 --> 03:16:53,540
Yeah, it's really good.

5597
03:16:53,620 --> 03:16:55,980
I have a stream at 5, but we can do it another time.

5598
03:16:56,280 --> 03:16:57,100
I hope.

5599
03:16:57,700 --> 03:16:59,660
We can do it next week.

5600
03:17:01,100 --> 03:17:01,500
Promise?

5601
03:17:02,020 --> 03:17:02,720
Yeah, I promise.

5602
03:17:03,780 --> 03:17:05,620
Do you remember that we're supposed to do the other game?

5603
03:17:05,760 --> 03:17:06,320
Yeah, I do.

5604
03:17:11,520 --> 03:17:12,460
I'm out of here.

5605
03:17:12,680 --> 03:17:13,620
Okay, see you guys.

5606
03:17:14,220 --> 03:17:14,620
Bye, everybody.

5607
03:17:17,660 --> 03:17:18,460
Thank you.

5608
03:17:18,460 --> 03:17:20,760
We did it!

5609
03:17:20,820 --> 03:17:22,340
We got first!

5610
03:17:23,080 --> 03:17:23,780
Let's go!

5611
03:17:26,360 --> 03:17:28,740
Okay, that Valorant fight...

5612
03:17:29,180 --> 03:17:31,000
That Valorant fight...

5613
03:17:31,000 --> 03:17:32,400
I need you guys to know...

5614
03:17:33,400 --> 03:17:34,160
I...

5615
03:17:34,160 --> 03:17:36,600
He wasn't even on my screen.

5616
03:17:39,640 --> 03:17:42,260
He wasn't even on my screen.

5617
03:17:42,460 --> 03:17:43,920
I just pre-fired.

5618
03:17:44,100 --> 03:17:45,720
Because he said he was pushing.

5619
03:17:46,000 --> 03:17:46,920
And it was...

5620
03:17:46,920 --> 03:17:49,520
It was a 50-50.

5621
03:17:49,800 --> 03:17:50,620
It was...

5622
03:17:50,620 --> 03:17:51,640
I won.

5623
03:17:51,880 --> 03:17:54,160
I literally won the 50-50.

5624
03:17:54,680 --> 03:17:57,240
I don't know if you guys saw that.

5625
03:17:57,380 --> 03:17:58,140
But like...

5626
03:17:58,140 --> 03:18:00,080
I didn't even see him on my screen.

5627
03:18:00,320 --> 03:18:01,640
Did you see him on my screen?

5628
03:18:02,000 --> 03:18:03,080
I didn't.

5629
03:18:05,020 --> 03:18:07,080
It was just an insane read.

5630
03:18:07,720 --> 03:18:08,880
Yeah, I just...

5631
03:18:08,880 --> 03:18:10,780
I read him because I was like...

5632
03:18:10,780 --> 03:18:12,520
Because they were all pre-firing.

5633
03:18:12,680 --> 03:18:13,340
I was like...

5634
03:18:13,340 --> 03:18:14,920
Wait, they're not even like...

5635
03:18:14,920 --> 03:18:17,340
I learned that they weren't even like...

5636
03:18:19,000 --> 03:18:20,600
They weren't even aiming.

5637
03:18:20,980 --> 03:18:22,640
They were literally just pre-firing.

5638
03:18:22,820 --> 03:18:24,800
So I was like, there's no point in me pushing up.

5639
03:18:25,700 --> 03:18:27,440
There was no point in me pushing up.

5640
03:18:27,460 --> 03:18:29,600
Because I had a feeling they were just going to rush...

5641
03:18:29,600 --> 03:18:30,900
They were going to run at me.

5642
03:18:30,960 --> 03:18:32,980
So if they're going to run at me, I'm just going to play Valorant.

5643
03:18:33,040 --> 03:18:33,980
And hide in a corner.

5644
03:18:33,980 --> 03:18:34,620
And...

5645
03:18:39,980 --> 03:18:41,480
I was just like...

5646
03:18:41,480 --> 03:18:43,060
If I'm going to be playing Valorant...

5647
03:18:43,060 --> 03:18:44,960
I'm going to be playing Valorant.

5648
03:18:47,660 --> 03:18:48,180
Like...

5649
03:19:03,980 --> 03:19:04,060
Thank you.

5650
03:19:06,500 --> 03:19:08,120
But yeah, it was really fun.

5651
03:19:08,180 --> 03:19:09,440
I'm really glad they invited me.

5652
03:19:10,480 --> 03:19:11,680
Invited me to Black Wars.

5653
03:19:11,900 --> 03:19:13,520
I had an incredible fun time.

5654
03:19:13,620 --> 03:19:15,620
I was learning everything as we go along.

5655
03:19:16,000 --> 03:19:18,460
So like...

5656
03:19:18,460 --> 03:19:20,720
I didn't know what...

5657
03:19:20,720 --> 03:19:22,380
Everybody else had a lot of experience.

5658
03:19:22,600 --> 03:19:23,960
So I was just like, what am I doing?

5659
03:19:24,120 --> 03:19:26,640
I was so confused in the race.

5660
03:19:27,180 --> 03:19:28,700
In the...

5661
03:19:28,700 --> 03:19:31,980
In the race and the...

5662
03:19:31,980 --> 03:19:33,460
The one where...

5663
03:19:33,460 --> 03:19:35,900
The extraction one was so confusing at first.

5664
03:19:35,980 --> 03:19:37,320
Because I don't use crossbows.

5665
03:19:37,440 --> 03:19:38,860
So I didn't know the charge up.

5666
03:19:39,100 --> 03:19:40,100
But we...

5667
03:19:40,100 --> 03:19:41,740
We did it.

5668
03:19:43,900 --> 03:19:46,320
I was so confused.

5669
03:19:50,080 --> 03:19:50,620
So...

5670
03:19:50,620 --> 03:19:53,100
I'm just glad we still got it.

5671
03:19:53,100 --> 03:19:54,580
We still won in the end.

5672
03:19:54,840 --> 03:19:56,740
We beat the Valorant team too.

5673
03:19:57,080 --> 03:19:58,660
We beat the Valorant team.

5674
03:19:58,660 --> 03:19:59,920
So that's all that matters.

5675
03:20:00,880 --> 03:20:02,520
Oh my god, that race though.

5676
03:20:02,640 --> 03:20:04,300
That race was fucking a disaster.

5677
03:20:04,300 --> 03:20:06,080
I'm so confused.

5678
03:20:06,660 --> 03:20:10,390
What the fuck is going on?

5679
03:20:11,980 --> 03:20:13,160
Because I can tell.

5680
03:20:13,480 --> 03:20:16,480
People here seem to have done this multiple times.

5681
03:20:17,020 --> 03:20:17,260
Like...

5682
03:20:17,970 --> 03:20:21,040
Everybody seems to know what's going on.

5683
03:20:24,760 --> 03:20:25,380
So...

5684
03:20:26,040 --> 03:20:27,820
We don't talk about that.

5685
03:20:29,080 --> 03:20:29,480
But...

5686
03:20:29,480 --> 03:20:31,500
I have...

5687
03:20:32,380 --> 03:20:34,180
We have a member stream tonight.

5688
03:20:34,560 --> 03:20:36,100
For Team Fortress 2 in 3 hours.

5689
03:20:36,480 --> 03:20:38,100
So I am going to prep for that.

5690
03:20:38,280 --> 03:20:40,160
I didn't tweet it out yet.

5691
03:20:40,220 --> 03:20:41,240
So I'm going to make a waiting for that.

5692
03:20:41,640 --> 03:20:43,120
There was no race in block wars yet.

5693
03:20:43,740 --> 03:20:45,380
But it was a great time with my team.

5694
03:20:45,520 --> 03:20:47,760
We did incredibly well.

5695
03:20:48,220 --> 03:20:50,020
I felt like the games were really fun.

5696
03:20:50,200 --> 03:20:51,220
Were really well designed.

5697
03:20:52,240 --> 03:20:54,780
And as always, everybody stay hydrated.

5698
03:20:54,960 --> 03:20:55,480
Posture check.

5699
03:20:55,480 --> 03:20:57,260
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

5700
03:20:57,340 --> 03:20:58,940
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

5701
03:20:59,020 --> 03:21:00,080
Because you deserve it.

5702
03:21:00,140 --> 03:21:01,180
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

5703
03:21:01,740 --> 03:21:02,380
Bye guys.

5704
03:21:03,060 --> 03:21:03,380
Bye.
