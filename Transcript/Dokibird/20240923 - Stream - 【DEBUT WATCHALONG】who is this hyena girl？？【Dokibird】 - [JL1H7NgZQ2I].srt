1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,940
Hello guys, no intro, we're going straight in.

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:13,440
Because I was like, if we let the intro play, like, her debut would have been like, oh yeah, her debut is literally starting now.

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,240
Like, I was like, we're going straight in.

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:28,220
If I had an intro in, guys, if I had an intro in, we would have missed, like, I don't know, like, already, they would have started their, uh, Lorde video.

5
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:38,220
I was like, oh man, I should have started a little early so I could just talk a little bit, but it's too late.

6
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,360
I, I, I agree to, I'm just doing my best.

7
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:54,520
Anyway, there won't be any visuals or audio of the debut stream, so please, uh, check out the link in the pinned messages to watch along with me.

8
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,160
I haven't done a debut watch along in a long time.

9
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,800
I tend to usually, in my opinion.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,480
I tend to usually, uh, if I, I don't, I think I talked about it before, during my last, uh, sponsored watch along.

11
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,880
By the way, this is sponsored, guys.

12
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:16,380
Um, this is, uh, sponsored by B for Mirai to watch their newest, I guess, I think, Gen 4 debut.

13
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:22,940
And I'll be watching their first up, uh, first streamer, which her name is Poma, Poma Pon.

14
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,000
Poma Pon?

15
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:24,960
Poma Pon?

16
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,360
Or, I think it's Poma Pon, because it's like, she's like a cheerleader.

17
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,600
She's like a hyena.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,920
She's like a girl, VTuber, cheerleader, so I assume it's like Poma Pon.

19
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:37,620
Um, I think, oh, I think her mascots are like Pomeranians.

20
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,480
I mean, that makes a lot of sense.

21
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:51,200
Like, that makes sense, you know, like, uh, but I personally, um, I have, I'm sorry, I have coffee right now.

22
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:59,180
My body is not used to streaming on Sunday, like, for three plus years.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,580
I have, I have usually made Sunday my rest day.

24
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,780
I just chugged down some coffee, like, real quick.

25
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,680
Um, literally, my body was, like, shutting down.

26
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:15,000
Because I was like, usually I take a nap right now.

27
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,040
Or I sleep in.

28
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,120
Um, but I was like, oh man, okay, body, you gotta work with me.

29
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,780
I'm sponsored today, body.

30
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,040
You gotta fucking work with me today.

31
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,840
Um, so I have coffee in my hand at the moment.

32
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,940
Iced coffee, by the way.

33
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,900
I don't drink warm coffee, I just don't like warm, warm coffee.

34
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,020
Oh my god, we could have had the intro playing.

35
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:45,880
I thought we were going, oh my god, we could, we actually could have had the intro playing!

36
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,700
It's okay, It's okay.

37
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,100
We had a little introduction for today.

38
00:02:53,560 --> 00:03:01,300
Um, but like I said, I tend to not watch, uh, debut streams because, um, I feel like debut streams are not an accurate representation...

39
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,980
This is the presentation of the VTuber in general.

40
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:10,680
I think like debut stream usually a lot of VTubers are like incredibly nervous and like Very nervous and everything.

41
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,940
So, um, oh my gosh, what is this?

42
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:31,480
This is her lore video and I usually watch like her like other peep their streams after like one or two weeks After they debut to see what they're like because usually in the first week They're all like trying to figure out who they are as a person So I tend to like off my free time.

43
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:37,760
I tend to know I don't watch debut streams in general All right her lore video

44
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:51,410
Oh my god, okay her outfit with the heart window

45
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,730
Just like oh my god

46
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,900
Yeah, the contrast after people get acclimated yeah

47
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:40,750
Lore directed and written by Oh Yeah, it's like those like 2000s 2000s like advertisements for videos oh My gosh, this is like an actual class I think like V for Mirai is like whole lore as a company is that they're a school Which is like you become a VTuber to go back to school.

48
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,630
I become a VTuber to like

49
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:48,770
Escape reality.

50
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:54,150
I don't want to relive school I don't want to relive.

51
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,850
I don't want to relive school

52
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:08,050
Take off the- I shouldn't say that Well,

53
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:27,030
I'm gonna say take off your hair clip there's too many I don't know what you guys think I was going to say.

54
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,510
Look at that tailed goat.

55
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:40,630
I mean, she is a hyena.

56
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,410
Dogs love to wag their tails.

57
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,080
Isn't she like the only cheerleader?

58
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,540
That's sad.

59
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:14,800
Being like having a cheer tryouts and then nobody else trying out because you're literally the only cheerleader.

60
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,980
Wait, hyenas are actually cats?

61
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,600
I didn't know that.

62
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,420
I mean, that would make sense.

63
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,560
Actually, that does make a little sense.

64
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,360
That does make sense.

65
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,520
Oh, it says 2022?

66
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,000
Wait, you're right.

67
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,500
Oh my god.

68
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,740
Wait, they're not new?

69
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,340
I thought they were new students.

70
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,220
What is the history?

71
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,210
I mean, oh they're closer to cats than dogs?

72
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,670
Then what kind of species are they?

73
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,580
She said that she hates humans.

74
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,960
Is that warrior cats?

75
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:05,400
Oh.

76
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,940
Warrior cats were popular around the time um...

77
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,560
Hurry!

78
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,540
It's furries or hags.

79
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,460
It's one or the other.

80
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,770
Visual novel style introduction.

81
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:48,830
The hardest part.

82
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:49,150
Okay.

83
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:55,110
I remember the hardest part regarding Lorde debut streams is also...

84
00:07:55,670 --> 00:08:05,530
It's so hard to have a creative debut stream um that like no one has done before because everything has done.

85
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:11,110
Everything has been done and you're always like especially if you're like debuting for the first time.

86
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:19,250
Um there is a budget like obviously like um you gotta fund everything yourself or there is like a small budget.

87
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:31,230
And obviously especially if you're new to the whole vtubing thing it's like depends on like how much you're willing to invest into it and if you'll have like a return on a return investment in the in your debut thing.

88
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:35,670
This is very difficult especially if you want a debut stream that catches people's attention.

89
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:42,450
Also yeah I never thought lore was important as many people forget it after a week.

90
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,210
That is also true.

91
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:48,430
People, a lot of debut streams, they will have like really complicated lore.

92
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:49,930
But then like...

93
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:51,970
They like...

94
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:57,050
This is why I tend to like see what they're like one to two weeks after the debut stream.

95
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:01,930
Because it's interesting to see how their personality settles.

96
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,690
And how they like diverge from the lore.

97
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:08,970
It's always funny because it's like, I am the...

98
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,390
I am...

99
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:18,590
I am the most powerful, powerful creature in the world and I am here to destroy society.

100
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:22,710
And then like two years later, they're like, I...

101
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:27,730
Oh man, I love getting bubble tea and hanging out and hanging out with everybody and...

102
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,420
Oh man, she got rejected again.

103
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,200
I've never been to a school with actual cheerleaders.

104
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,180
I think it's because like I went to international school.

105
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,620
And like...

106
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,440
We just...

107
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,120
We just...

108
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,640
I just...

109
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,520
We just didn't have enough people to be cheerleaders.

110
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:16,920
Like...

111
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,520
I think...

112
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,920
I don't know if it's an American thing.

113
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,040
I don't know if it's like an American thing.

114
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:31,180
But I've never actually had like an opportunity to like see cheerleaders in the wild.

115
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,940
Like real cheerleaders.

116
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,320
Is it like an American thing?

117
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,120
I know you can like make a lot of money being a cheerleader because of like...

118
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,560
You get to do it like NFL and stuff like that.

119
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,300
That's really impressive though.

120
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:55,920
Like...

121
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,980
Gen 4...

122
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:04,500
Like for a new gen to get like 50,000 subscribers before they debut.

123
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,020
That's incredibly impressive.

124
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,520
That's really good for them.

125
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,780
Are cheerleaders real?

126
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,660
I don't know if America just invented it for like TV or movies.

127
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,080
Oh, she's...

128
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,460
She's a yandere.

129
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,000
Is America...

130
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,340
Yes, they are very real.

131
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,040
I...

132
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:40,040
God, I hope they're real because their American money is so much better than almost the rest of the world except for euros.

133
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,400
And the British pound.

134
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:55,800
What I love about NFL is that it only exists in America.

135
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,680
I think it's...

136
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:06,040
I think it's funny because like, you know, it's like all the other sports that America loves to play exists in the rest of the world.

137
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,780
But the NFL is literally just in America.

138
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,060
Yes!

139
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:11,620
Yes!

140
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:12,660
Yes!

141
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:13,660
Yes!

142
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:13,880
Yes!

143
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,140
Yes!

144
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:14,360
Yes!

145
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:14,500
Yes!

146
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:15,940
Yes!

147
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,120
Yes!

148
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:16,220
Yes!

149
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,300
It literally doesn't exist anywhere else.

150
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,460
We played it in Brazil this year.

151
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,560
Yeah, this year.

152
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,440
It only just started.

153
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,900
The World Championships of NFL.

154
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,340
Only in America.

155
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,020
Sorry.

156
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,080
What about the Canadian football?

157
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,180
We have a Canadian football?

158
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,300
That's how I feel about it.

159
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:48,520
I didn't even realize there's a Canadian football.

160
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:48,960
So, we got a three-point finish.

161
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,560
Like footballing.

162
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,340
Oh, shit.

163
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,140
We're good.

164
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,000
Oh, my God.

165
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:53,960
Is that MSN?

166
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:54,880
Like...

167
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:56,900
Oh, no.

168
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,680
It's AIM...

169
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,060
Oh, no.

170
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,240
She is a hack.

171
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,400
There's no way.

172
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,460
How does she know how AAM looks like?

173
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,400
I thought it was MSN.

174
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,960
I didn't realize there's something before MSN.

175
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:12,440
I didn't even know what the thing before MSN looks like.

176
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,520
How does she know what the thing looked like before MSN?

177
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,080
That's creative.

178
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,540
That's cute.

179
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,860
That's cute, but also AIM.

180
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:54,410
Guys, her eyes are up there.

181
00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:01,430
Guys, her eyes are up here, guys.

182
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,170
Guys, remember where her eyes are.

183
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:09,150
Remember where her eyes are.

184
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,800
Did anyone sign up for a cheer tryouts?

185
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:20,960
Is this a cheer tryouts?

186
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,960
Are we all like...

187
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,700
Did she like force us?

188
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,220
Did she like force our names to sign up for a cheer tryouts?

189
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,660
Looking respectively.

190
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,460
Oh my god.

191
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,540
I think...

192
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,040
Okay, what I love about her skin suit is that...

193
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,260
Oh wait, no, it's her actual skin.

194
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:55,540
What I love about her entire being is that...

195
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,880
Oh my god.

196
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,560
Is that...

197
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:06,720
There's more movement down there than there is at the... at the hair.

198
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,920
Oh my god.

199
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:24,930
They just know where the... they got the priorities correct.

200
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:26,850
That's true.

201
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,490
Alright, what are the activities?

202
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,250
For cheer tryouts?

203
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:47,150
Ma'am, I don't think that's what you do at cheerleading.

204
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,390
Wait, you're right.

205
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:03,790
Why are there grenades on her...

206
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:05,130
Wait!

207
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,470
Wait, you're right.

208
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,330
Why are there grenades on her skirt?

209
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,900
Oh, she plays Fallout.

210
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:23,780
She's like a... I guess like a long RPG... a long game streamer.

211
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,500
Oh shit, that's... just like me.

212
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,560
Oh shit, that's...

213
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:31,560
just like me.

214
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,160
I'm sorry for talking over here, guys.

215
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:33,940
I'm sorry!

216
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:39,900
I'm not used to just... like... like... not talking for a while.

217
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,920
For watch-a-longs.

218
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,580
Wait, are hyenas stupid?

219
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,660
Are hyenas stupid?

220
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,960
Hyenas are part of intelligent and loving hy...

221
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,440
Wait, what's wrong with her?

222
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,860
I literally... I literally...

223
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:15,340
These animals are fierce, social, and incredibly smart.

224
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,600
Wait a minute.

225
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,780
What's wrong?

226
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:23,820
What happened?

227
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,440
That's what she said!

228
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:31,680
She's like, I'm a hyena, so I'm stupid.

229
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,920
I'm like, is that true?

230
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,240
I thought...

231
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,930
She's just special.

232
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,100
Is it because she's...

233
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,440
Well, crows are smart.

234
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,880
Yeah, but I... everybody knows I'm stupid.

235
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,900
It doesn't matter what type of animal or what type of... or what type of thing I am.

236
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,620
Like, I'm...

237
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,740
Oh, wait, she has a heart on...

238
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:44,120
Sorry, my eyes were respectfully at her eyes, by the way.

239
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,700
But I just noticed a heart.

240
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:51,160
Guys, it took me this long because respectfully, I was not looking at that place.

241
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,240
I'm smart.

242
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:59,620
It's like a

243
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:03,510
heart within a heart.

244
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:24,480
Alright.

245
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,060
How else are you gonna have explosions at your child's?

246
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,740
Alright, so there's no liability forms that were signed.

247
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,120
There's no...

248
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,660
Alright,

249
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,000
people definitely did not sign any liability... liability contracts.

250
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,860
Like a true American.

251
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,940
Wouldn't it be funny if she's not even American in the end?

252
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:54,420
Like...

253
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:59,200
And she's not even American in the end.

254
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,000
Oh my God, do a flip!

255
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,400
Do a flip!

256
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:26,650
Oh my God, she's flipping!

257
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,110
Oh my God!

258
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:34,210
Wait, is she like actually moving while this happens?

259
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:34,870
Oh my...

260
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:35,370
Oh!

261
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,760
Toki, can you do a flip?

262
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:46,780
She's too...

263
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,080
She's always been too deep.

264
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,540
She actually did a flip!

265
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,700
Oh my God!

266
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,700
Oh my God.

267
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,780
What is she?

268
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:13,120
What the fuck?

269
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,160
What?

270
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,160
What the fuck?

271
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,220
What the fuck?

272
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,940
What the fuck?

273
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,820
Biblically accurate hyena!

274
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,840
She's a biblically accurate hyena!

275
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,340
Wait, is she doing a fucking split?

276
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,300
What is that?

277
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:47,310
Guys, I wrote this debut, by the way.

278
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:48,970
I wrote this debut.

279
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:54,290
I was the ghost writer.

280
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,160
Do not be afraid.

281
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,320
Yes!

282
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,600
I mean, to be fair, I noticed that...

283
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,280
I'm pretty sure all the B4MRI girls get their 3D eventually.

284
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,260
Like, really fast, actually, too.

285
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:22,540
No...

286
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,340
Oh my God...

287
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,080
No...

288
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,160
Not the AI for like that.

289
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:46,000
The reason why it's really cursed is that you're not supposed to use illustrations for it.

290
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,400
I've seen...

291
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,280
I've seen people use that program.

292
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,120
It's actually so fucking weird.

293
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,760
You can actually...

294
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,000
You can actually...

295
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,820
Like, if you can use...

296
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,680
It's supposed to be, like, with regular pictures of people.

297
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,320
And it's so...

298
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,680
It's so accurate.

299
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,920
I saw, like...

300
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,620
One of my...

301
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,880
One of the TikToks...

302
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,460
Not TikToks...

303
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,860
One of the YouTube shorts people I watch...

304
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:13,000
That does, like, Peach and Bowser cosplays...

305
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,120
He, like...

306
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:19,160
She made, like, the Bowser cosplayer do a Fortnite dance with just a picture.

307
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:28,870
High energy?

308
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:29,790
Well...

309
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,450
Well, when you...

310
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:32,750
Especially if you're new...

311
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,250
And you have a lot of eyes on you...

312
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:38,110
On your first debut, you usually have, like, a lot of energy.

313
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:40,270
And that's just based off my experience.

314
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:41,970
Because when I debuted...

315
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,630
I had so much fucking energy.

316
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:46,030
Because I was so nervous, too.

317
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:46,910
So I had to, like...

318
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:48,850
Expel all my energy here.

319
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,540
Do we win anything?

320
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,980
Oh, the nerves is...

321
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,320
In game, right?

322
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,880
Wait, she didn't say in game, guys.

323
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,940
Guys, she didn't say in game.

324
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,960
It's her first impression.

325
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:23,940
Yeah.

326
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,160
Yeah.

327
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,200
Especially when...

328
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,700
There's so many, uh, debuts nowadays.

329
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,060
Um...

330
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,360
You know, you have to have, like...

331
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,180
A lot of energy going in.

332
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,580
Because it's your first impression.

333
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,540
Oh, yeah, no.

334
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,080
A lot of...

335
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,820
A lot of people drink coffee before their debut.

336
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,900
Because they're, like...

337
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,620
Um...

338
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:47,180
I know, like, people would be, like, so scared or nervous that they can't sleep the day before their debut.

339
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,060
So they would, like, drink, like, caffeine the day...

340
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:50,360
Like...

341
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,440
Before streaming.

342
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,060
I mean...

343
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:19,420
True.

344
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,820
I don't really watch a lot of anime.

345
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,860
But, like, I know that.

346
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,320
About the second season.

347
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,820
They, like, what?

348
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:30,220
They, like, changed a lot of stuff about Promised Neverland, right?

349
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,200
For the second season.

350
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,960
They diverted from the manga for some reason.

351
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:43,130
Also, thank you guys for the Super Chess.

352
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:45,750
I'm sorry I can't read, uh, read them off the bat.

353
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,470
For today's stream.

354
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:53,010
Alright, now they'll never send hearts again.

355
00:25:58,170 --> 00:25:58,770
Noooo!

356
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,750
My heart is broken!

357
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:04,150
I'll never send a heart again!

358
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,560
You never even superchatted, surefory!

359
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,420
Don't be a fucking liar!

360
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:28,530
What was the last anime I watched?

361
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,190
Oh my god that's hard to say.

362
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:32,110
I don't even...

363
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:37,950
I think JJK... JJK the episode before the city.

364
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,860
Pink team!

365
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,900
I'm pink team!

366
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,760
Oh, is this chat interaction?

367
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:07,360
I always wanted to do a chat interaction...

368
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,920
A chat interaction game.

369
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,140
They always seem really fun.

370
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,520
They're like, you know, like Twitch plays Pokemon.

371
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,780
I need to hire a programmer for that shit.

372
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:24,000
Because I know a lot of like chat interaction stuff usually works on Twitch but not on YouTube.

373
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,980
So it's like a whole new thing.

374
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,040
Guys, I'm on pink team, guys.

375
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,040
Are you really gonna let me lose?

376
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,060
Guys!

377
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,820
Are you really gonna let me lose?

378
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,520
Guys!

379
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,340
This is a crime!

380
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,600
This is a fucking crime!

381
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:03,800
Yeah.

382
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,280
Stop rigging it.

383
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,040
That's right.

384
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,320
We're gonna rig...

385
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,480
We're gonna rig the debut.

386
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,760
I swear to God.

387
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,660
As pink team, we deserve to...

388
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,900
Why would you love yourself?

389
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,580
Why would you say that?

390
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,470
Wait, we're...

391
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:34,530
How do we know who wins?

392
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,030
How do we...

393
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,640
Guys.

394
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:51,040
What's the point of like rigging the debut when it doesn't go my way?

395
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,060
It's...

396
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,180
Robbed!

397
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,240
We were robbed!

398
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,560
I spite voted for blue.

399
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,720
That's fucked.

400
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,960
That's so fucked.

401
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,360
What?

402
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:19,680
Oh.

403
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,300
Mama!

404
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,280
Is this a pager?

405
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:26,680
Is...

406
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,860
What year is this?

407
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,740
How much are pagers now?

408
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,020
How much is a pa...

409
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,320
Do people still use that?

410
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,760
Do doctors actually use it?

411
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,680
Pagers are $300?

412
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,100
Oh, no.

413
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:38,880
It's 20 to 80.

414
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,240
For a basic numeric pager.

415
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,120
What year is this?

416
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,000
I don't know what year is this anymore.

417
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:53,540
First it's 2022 and then she pulled up AIM.

418
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,660
And then she's debuting now.

419
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,500
And now there's a pager?

420
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:58,500
Now...

421
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,340
Hospitals use pagers.

422
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,760
Does she look like she's in the hospital?

423
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,520
Oh my god.

424
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:11,920
We're back.

425
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,060
Now we're in 2010.

426
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,700
Party rocking's in the house tonight.

427
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:20,700
Ba da da da da da ba da da da da da.

428
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,200
Da da da da...

429
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:22,740
I like...

430
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,780
I like that you can see the...

431
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:26,660
The...

432
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,840
The big ol' dot AI.

433
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,820
Hey guys, that's where she got it.

434
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,920
The score on that line is weird.

435
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,800
Are they like in hyperbolic time chamber?

436
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,680
Like, you know how they...

437
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,460
In some shows they're like they're trapped in the 80s forever.

438
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:44,860
Like...

439
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,000
Is she a time travel teacher leader?

440
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,580
Rockin' in the house tonight.

441
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,620
Everybody's gonna have a good time.

442
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,840
Rockin' in the house tonight.

443
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:19,790
I'm getting whiplash.

444
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,010
It's a sing-along!

445
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,090
Shake it.

446
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:30,130
Rockin' in the house tonight.

447
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:30,470
Everybody's gonna have a good time.

448
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:40,230
Guys, I lived at a time when party... every fucking school assembly, there will be the dance club doing god damn party rocking.

449
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:42,450
And it fucking never stops.

450
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:46,950
Like, it'll be like a school assembly and we're like, guys, we're gonna do a demonstration!

451
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:49,250
And then it's always party rocking.

452
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:50,910
It's never anything else.

453
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:53,550
It's Gangnam Style or it's party rocking.

454
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,910
I fucking hated it.

455
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,690
Anyway, I love this song.

456
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:03,950
I just... I just hated the dance.

457
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:05,690
Rockin'

458
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,460
in the house tonight.

459
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:22,230
There's also I got a... Oh, and then...

460
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:25,210
What was it?

461
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:30,890
I saw on Twitter, someone was like, what does the fox say?

462
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:34,170
It was that generation's skibbity toilet.

463
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:37,650
But that is a fucking insult to what does a fox say.

464
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,190
How dare...

465
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:46,890
I felt like... I felt like that was actually a crime for saying that.

466
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:48,870
That is a lie.

467
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:51,650
I was like, how dare you...

468
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:55,290
How dare they... What slander is this?

469
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:58,050
That is actually a hate crime.

470
00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:59,110
Like...

471
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,260
Get up, get down.

472
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,180
Put your hands up to the down.

473
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,960
Get up, get down.

474
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:24,260
You know what's sad about that?

475
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,780
You know what's sad about the... the...

476
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:33,920
I'm sad because they broke up after having like... like 500,000 hit songs together.

477
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,520
Because they were like uncle and nephew.

478
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,320
Duel.

479
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:41,920
And then they broke up after... after like all their songs got... were hits.

480
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,000
And then... and then... because it was money.

481
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,200
It was money.

482
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:50,300
They're like... they were just really greedy.

483
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:56,380
So they broke up and tried to pursue solo careers and obviously it didn't work.

484
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:59,500
Which sucks because their songs are actual bangers.

485
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,960
Like... they're like really good like dance music.

486
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,020
Yeah, apparently the uncle was...

487
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,980
Like a douchebag.

488
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,580
Yeah, they were really, really good.

489
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:18,020
Really, really good dance music.

490
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:33,560
When you get DMCA'd, this background track is not the actual...

491
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:36,700
This background track is definitely not Party Rockin'.

492
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,080
So she's safe.

493
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,720
As somebody that has listened to Party Rockin'...

494
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,660
So much in my youth.

495
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:50,020
I know for sure this background track is not gonna get DMCA'd.

496
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:50,700
Like...

497
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,920
I've heard it so many times.

498
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,970
Party rocking in the house tonight.

499
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:18,750
Ba dum ba dum bum ba dum bum bum.

500
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:22,490
Ba dum ba dum ba dum bum ba dum.

501
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,990
Ba da da da da.

502
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,350
Shake it.

503
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:32,510
Ha ha ha ha ha Every day I'm shuffling.

504
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:36,390
Ba dum ba dum bum bum ba dum.

505
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:38,430
Ba da da dum bum bum ba dum ba dum.

506
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:39,330
Ba da dum bum ba dum ba dum.

507
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:42,040
Ba da ba dum bum ba dum ba dum.

508
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,840
Ha ha ha ha.

509
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,000
Can I have my lawyer look at this contract?

510
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,560
Ha ha ha ha.

511
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,340
All right.

512
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,040
All right.

513
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,000
I need like one to two business days.

514
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,100
And have my lawyer look at this contract.

515
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,300
Guys, never sign a contract.

516
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,320
Guys, never sign a contract right away, guys!

517
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:06,460
Guys!

518
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:07,660
Dragoons!

519
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:11,280
Guys, get your lawyers to read the fine print!

520
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:16,000
As somebody that's paid a lot of money and have two lawyers on retainer.

521
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,440
Do not do that!

522
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:31,290
It's okay.

523
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:32,430
You can like...

524
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:35,210
You can get like regurgitated...

525
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:35,930
Uh...

526
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:38,410
Lawyer advice!

527
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:41,390
Do not use me for lawyer advice, by the way.

528
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:43,090
Do not... What is that word for?

529
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:47,010
For like... Oh, do not use me for trickle-down lawyer advice, guys.

530
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:51,150
I pay too much money to spread that lawyer advice to you guys.

531
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:03,750
BabyTuber told me to do it.

532
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,010
Politely say no.

533
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:10,410
Politely say no.

534
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:12,330
Politely say no.

535
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:14,290
Politely say no.

536
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:14,470
Yay!

537
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:16,870
It's not rigged!

538
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:19,270
It's not rigged!

539
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,120
Say no.

540
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:34,720
Say...

541
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,440
She's crying!

542
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,180
Why are you laughing?

543
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:40,780
Say no.

544
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,930
Say no.

545
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:16,590
Insist no.

546
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:21,150
She literally said she has a restraining order!

547
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:24,610
Why would I sign the contract after that?

548
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:26,990
That doesn't make it better!

549
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:30,530
Those are like red flags!

550
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:39,130
Red flags!

551
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:42,270
Women crying by one weakness!

552
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:46,730
Oh my gosh, she's about to go Monica on us.

553
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,800
Oh, it is Monica!

554
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:52,900
We're in space!

555
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,520
You see that?

556
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,040
We're in space chat!

557
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,720
Gives the best totally official legal advice.

558
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:01,340
Yes.

559
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,880
Thank you!

560
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:08,200
Oh my god, we got the Doki Doki Literature Club ending!

561
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,000
It's the secret easter egg ending!

562
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:12,680
Like how Silent Hill has the little doggy!

563
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:17,580
Like, you know when you get the secret easter egg ending and it's always that dog and the UFO?

564
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:18,500
This is it!

565
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,860
Oh, she has a lot of different expressions.

566
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:35,850
No.

567
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:36,130
No.

568
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:38,170
No.

569
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:41,830
No.

570
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:44,490
No.

571
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,070
Yay!

572
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:50,810
Wait, what?

573
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:53,330
Closing the tab.

574
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:54,430
I'm joking!

575
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:55,210
I'm joking!

576
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,530
I'm joking!

577
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:03,790
I'm joking!

578
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:03,850
I'm joking!

579
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:07,630
Old F4!

580
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,330
Old F4!

581
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:23,190
Guys, remember the hot crazy scale?

582
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:27,430
We have to sign the contract on the hot crazy scale.

583
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:32,530
It's like from good ol' Barney Simpson, who is the most reliable guy out there.

584
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:37,330
Wait, wait!

585
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:38,130
What is this?

586
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:39,070
What is this contract?

587
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:41,170
Alterations to terms.

588
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:43,090
Reserves the right to alter these terms.

589
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:45,390
The contract is internal and cannot...

590
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:46,670
Guys, the contract is eternal!

591
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,330
The contract...

592
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:50,590
She has three.

593
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:51,810
Look, biblically accurate.

594
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:53,110
Hyena.

595
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:05,690
What do you mean, why did I sign it?

596
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,350
Why didn't you sign it?

597
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:09,470
And then you said eternal.

598
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:11,450
And then you said eternal.

599
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,340
Palm squad training video.

600
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,920
Stop being dramatic!

601
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,840
Stop being dramatic!

602
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,040
Dragoons!

603
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,180
I said calmly.

604
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,240
Alright, what's the palm squad...

605
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,500
Wait, is that a DVD?

606
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,900
Why is the DVD of VHS quality?

607
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:51,980
Why?

608
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,080
Oh my god!

609
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,500
Look, there's puppets!

610
00:41:55,600 --> 00:42:00,520
I love how the DVD is like VHS quality.

611
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,000
What year is this?

612
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,680
This is a hyperbolic time chamber.

613
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:07,220
It's a CDR.

614
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,180
It's a CDR.

615
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,180
Why is it...

616
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,260
It's a hot new technology.

617
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,760
Don't keep...

618
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,880
That's really cool.

619
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:23,500
The puppet.

620
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:26,600
It's like a full on muppet.

621
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:34,310
It's a VHS rip-off on CDR.

622
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:36,070
Wait, how do you know about that?

623
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:37,350
What does that even mean?

624
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:41,810
What does that even mean?

625
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:43,010
What does that even mean?

626
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:50,820
Oh my god.

627
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,800
The RTX on is like so HD.

628
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:57,970
Oh my god!

629
00:42:58,030 --> 00:42:59,790
She even made the dog?

630
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:01,250
Oh, that's cute!

631
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:01,550
Cute!

632
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:26,520
Oh, that's why she wanted to do crafting streams.

633
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:30,860
She can like make puppets.

634
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:35,720
I like copyright free Mario on the top right.

635
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:36,620
Did you guys see that?

636
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,540
She's perfect Doki.

637
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:40,340
I love her.

638
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:44,220
This would be the only Super Chat I've read because how fucking dare you.

639
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:47,840
On my stream.

640
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:51,860
Thank you for the Super Chat.

641
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,280
Thank you, thank you.

642
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:57,640
Am I getting NTR'd right now?

643
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,480
On my sponsored stream.

644
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:28,050
And guys, none of you guys signed, right?

645
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:30,370
Okay, I'm joking.

646
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:32,330
I'm joking, guys.

647
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,240
Wait, is this a call?

648
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:55,880
Oh my god.

649
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:59,520
I would never kill you guys like how she killed that sock puppet.

650
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:01,740
Intentionally.

651
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:09,840
If it's an accident, that's not my fault.

652
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,760
You've done it so many times.

653
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,260
It was all an accident.

654
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:20,660
I would never do it intentionally.

655
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:27,320
They were all an accident.

656
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:41,840
Pom Squad.

657
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:04,740
It's okay.

658
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,940
Our names aren't on it.

659
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,880
That's not a legal binding name.

660
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:10,920
I don't think she even has Pom Squad trademarked.

661
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:11,720
So like...

662
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:15,340
Legally...

663
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:20,100
It's not legally binding, guys.

664
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:21,180
It's not legally binding, guys.

665
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:28,780
Call your lawyers!

666
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:29,540
Quick Trademark it!

667
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:33,180
Quick Trademark Pom Squad!

668
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:35,420
Call your lawyers!

669
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:02,970
Holy shit!

670
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:04,490
Cheerleading is so hardcore!

671
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:11,290
Any cheerleaders in chat, do you back me up on this?

672
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:12,170
Is this true?

673
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:14,650
Is this what cheerleading is like?

674
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,160
Damn.

675
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:24,280
I didn't even realize Cheerleading is this hardcore.

676
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:43,670
Where is she?

677
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:50,010
That was really creative.

678
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:51,410
The puppet thing.

679
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:58,010
And it really showed her creativity on what you can see on the crafting stuff too.

680
00:47:58,010 --> 00:48:05,230
Since I believe her main branding has to be her crafting.

681
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:10,540
What?

682
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:11,080
MySpace?

683
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:12,820
What?

684
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:20,780
Are we in the 80s, 90s, 2000s, 2010s?

685
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:21,340
What year?

686
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:23,340
What year?

687
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:28,260
What year are we in?

688
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:38,060
Oh, oh, it's over.

689
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:39,360
Oh, okay.

690
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,700
Oh, that was the ending screen.

691
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:46,860
Oh, okay.

692
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:50,480
2024.

693
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:52,820
Are we in 2024?

694
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:54,480
I can't tell anymore.

695
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:55,720
I can't.

696
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,740
That was a fever dream.

697
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:01,820
Oh my god.

698
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:07,920
I really like her creativity in terms of like how she presented the whole 90s.

699
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,080
I guess it's the 90s aesthetic.

700
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:13,840
The whole 90s to 2010s aesthetic.

701
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:16,760
It was really interesting to see.

702
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:20,540
I actually, I never knew what AIM looked like.

703
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,000
So I was like, what the fuck is that?

704
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,320
That does not look like MSN.

705
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,540
So I was like, oh my god, AIM.

706
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,380
The thing before MSN?

707
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:32,720
I think that was like literally the first time I've ever seen it.

708
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:40,120
But yeah, her little puppets were, her little puppets were really cute.

709
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:45,240
I really enjoyed the puppet section because it really does show like, like what her creativity.

710
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:55,640
And it sort of gives me the glimpse of like what her, what her stream could turn into and what her branding could be in the next couple of weeks.

711
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,040
So that part is like what's...

712
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:59,180
is the most interesting.

713
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:05,160
Because every debut stream it was like, it's like, what is it that makes this VTuber special?

714
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:11,340
And the puppet thing is like her niche that I can see that she can develop a lot more later on too.

715
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:13,880
Yeah, it's a good preview.

716
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:21,960
And yeah, she has some, she has like Lollipop Chainsaw Repop, which is like a good game choice for her.

717
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:24,940
Because like her aesthetic is practically that game.

718
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:28,020
And then she has her Handcam stream, which is like...

719
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:31,860
which is basically, I guess, making puppets and then talking about her favorite game.

720
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:33,640
And I assume Half-Life is her...

721
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:36,480
Half-Life is her favorite game series.

722
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:38,680
Because she talked about it earlier.

723
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:41,860
All right, guys, I got to send you off to the next debut.

724
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,640
But I hope you guys enjoyed this Watch-A-Lot.

725
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:50,360
I usually don't really know what to do when I'm doing debut Watch-A-Lot.

726
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:51,960
So I hope I did an okay job.

727
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:53,440
I hope I did!

728
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:57,820
I hope I did an okay job watching a lot.

729
00:50:57,860 --> 00:50:58,000
I hope I did an okay job watching a lot.

730
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,860
Because it's hard to balance like...

731
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:04,720
For me, I'm like wondering, oh, when do I talk?

732
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,280
When do I commentate?

733
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:12,880
But yeah, I'm going to go right into the next debut stream now.

734
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:14,860
I hope you guys had a great time watching.

735
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:17,060
Feel free to check out Pullman Pollen.

736
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,260
Her debut was very interesting to watch.

737
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:25,820
Very creative in terms of what she is going into in her future as a VTuber.

738
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:28,000
But yes, I'm going to send you off.

739
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:29,160
To the next debut now.

740
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:31,120
As always everybody, stay hydrated.

741
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,080
Posture check up.

742
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,320
And move around to get that blood flowing.

743
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:34,980
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

744
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:36,300
Because you deserve it.

745
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:37,500
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

746
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:38,780
Bye guys!

747
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:39,540
Bye!
