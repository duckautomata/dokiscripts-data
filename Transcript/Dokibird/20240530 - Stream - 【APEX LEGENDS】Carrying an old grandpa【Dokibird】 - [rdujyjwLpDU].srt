1
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,900
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:51,980
Hello, hello!

3
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,900
Look who I met randomly in Apex.

4
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,040
That's our story, right?

5
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:58,960
Tenjin, that's...

6
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,900
Say something, Tenjin!

7
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:05,620
Come on!

8
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,920
Who is this man?

9
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,680
He's fucking old, that's who.

10
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,720
Nice to meet you.

11
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,060
My name is Tenjin.

12
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,140
Fuck off!

13
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,240
I met Doki randomly in a lobby.

14
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,860
Nice to meet you, Tenjin.

15
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,260
Hey, Tenjin's chat!

16
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,200
Fuck off!

17
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:33,360
Yeah, yeah, we met randomly in a pubs match in Apex.

18
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,780
And I was like, whoa, dude, you should be a streamer.

19
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,460
And so I did!

20
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,160
Yeah!

21
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,260
I started this man's career.

22
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,560
Yeah!

23
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,280
Hell yeah!

24
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:49,840
Yeah!

25
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,140
Oh my god.

26
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:51,780
My stomach hurts.

27
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,420
Are you okay?

28
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,300
I've been trying to poop, it doesn't come out.

29
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,400
Oh yeah, he's been having like digestive issues.

30
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,580
Well, to be fair, there's been a lot of issues, but...

31
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:06,820
What issues?

32
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,460
You've been... what do you mean?

33
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,780
You're always sick!

34
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,140
What the fuck do you mean?

35
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,380
You're always fucking sick.

36
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:12,880
What do you mean?

37
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,560
What do you know about me?

38
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,060
We just met.

39
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,060
Oh, I mean like today you were telling me...

40
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,400
Okay, that's a lie because you called me out on stream.

41
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,460
Like that's a...

42
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,120
That's a fucking lie!

43
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,180
You literally called me out on stream!

44
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,240
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

45
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,920
A few days ago, I was lurking and he called me out.

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,480
Yeah?

47
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:35,960
Yeah?

48
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:36,920
What's your excuse?

49
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:37,940
No, that didn't happen.

50
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:38,660
That didn't happen.

51
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:43,140
Oh yeah, yeah, that fucking thing... you do know people clipped us, you know?

52
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,360
It was fucking...

53
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,500
Whoa, I got clipped?

54
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,100
No way!

55
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,900
Yeah, you got fucking clipped!

56
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,760
I'm nobody!

57
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,560
I was fucking lurking.

58
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:04,280
Bro, I... oh, by the way, by the way, Tenjin, I told them... you remember that... remember that Tarkov story you told me?

59
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:12,180
The one where you... like... the one where you spent money on Tarkov after the whole scam thing because it was 80% off?

60
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,060
It was 50% off, though.

61
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,200
It was 50%... yeah, yeah, they... like, I told that story...

62
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:16,900
Yeah, but it was 50% off, though.

63
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,540
I told that story, but I didn't mention, like, who it was.

64
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:20,900
It was this man.

65
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,480
Yeah, but it was 50% off.

66
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,740
They literally just got out of a scam!

67
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,160
Yo, I'm blind.

68
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,080
You're blind.

69
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,020
Was it worth it?

70
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:34,920
Was it worth it?

71
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:35,280
No.

72
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,240
What?

73
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,820
I thought it was 80%.

74
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,700
It was actually 50%.

75
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,020
It was not.

76
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,460
If it was 80%, then it would've been worth it, but, like, you know...

77
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,520
It definitely would be.

78
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,080
Yes.

79
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,340
Yeah, it was 80%.

80
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,380
Anyway, guys... guys, someone quick refund him that money right now.

81
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,340
Someone refund him that money.

82
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,300
Hell, I'm about to get reimbursed.

83
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:00,880
No way.

84
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:01,820
Reimbursed.

85
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:05,280
Time to ask Steam for a refund real quick.

86
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,160
I can't aim.

87
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,420
Oh, nah, this thing is not tough.

88
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,280
Okay, I'm good.

89
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:08,960
Alright.

90
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:09,700
I'm dead.

91
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,180
Are you dead already?

92
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,940
We literally just... Oh my god, we literally just started...

93
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,000
Wait, do we have a new castle?

94
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,500
Wait, there's a new castle here.

95
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,620
Yeah, there's everyone here.

96
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,120
Wait, no, there's literally a new castle thing here.

97
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,740
That means there's a... Is there a team here?

98
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,400
Yeah, no, the enemy has a new castle.

99
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,580
Oh, oh, okay, okay, okay.

100
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:28,760
That's fine.

101
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,360
That's fine.

102
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:29,700
Whoa!

103
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,960
Are we getting... run out?

104
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,760
Yeah, we're getting...

105
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,320
No, we're not.

106
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,220
I knocked one.

107
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,060
Our teammate's dead.

108
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,300
Am I left?

109
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,060
Oh, he's so low!

110
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,760
Yeah, he's dead.

111
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,120
He's dead.

112
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:45,440
He's dead.

113
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,320
Yippee!

114
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:47,580
Yeah!

115
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:50,680
Yippee!

116
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,260
Nice.

117
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,360
Our teammate's dog shit.

118
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,220
Alright, so what have you been playing?

119
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,940
Where have you been... Oh, what the fuck?

120
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:02,320
Whoa!

121
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,220
How is he dead again?

122
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,620
Got you?

123
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,060
I got you.

124
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:08,860
Are you good?

125
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,340
Oh, you are not good.

126
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,020
You are not good.

127
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:11,600
You are not good.

128
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,840
I am not.

129
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:13,580
How?

130
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,500
I am still.

131
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,340
Oh my god, he's... Holy shit!

132
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,340
I'm fucking...

133
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,200
Bro!

134
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,140
Okay, I'm definitely lagging.

135
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,460
Yeah, well, you insisted playing here.

136
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,900
Yeah, yeah, okay, look.

137
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,660
Okay, look, it'll be fine.

138
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,540
It'll be fine.

139
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,700
I just... I hit like seven bullets and none of them registered.

140
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,940
I just need you to know that.

141
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,340
Oh, shit.

142
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,060
What's the chat?

143
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,280
How's the volume for you?

144
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,300
Oh, I'm using a Tengen now.

145
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,060
How is that?

146
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:42,640
Is that okay?

147
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,760
How's my volume on Tengen stream too?

148
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,680
You'll be fine.

149
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,000
What do you mean?

150
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,200
I put you on Compressor.

151
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,320
Oh, that's true.

152
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,460
Wait, so what have you been playing recently, Tengen?

153
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,160
I know you've been playing that finals game because...

154
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,820
For just the tournament.

155
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,560
Uh-huh, even though it's just for tournament.

156
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:02,960
Yeah.

157
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,620
But like... What did I play?

158
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,100
Yeah, what have you been playing?

159
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,020
Look, we've been having a rut, okay, guys?

160
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,300
That's a good question.

161
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,800
We have like zero FPS games to play these days.

162
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,860
I have... It is a hard time for FPS games.

163
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,340
Yeah, it's a hard time for us.

164
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,800
I like how someone said Tengen life alert fun, but then super chatted to me.

165
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,700
Thank you, man.

166
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,520
Don't worry.

167
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,020
I'll make sure Tengen gets it.

168
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:31,960
What?

169
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:32,360
Nah.

170
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:34,460
Nah.

171
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,140
Oh, wait.

172
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,240
Have you tried X-Defiant yet?

173
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,480
Um... My friend's been trying to convince me to play, actually.

174
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,880
The good part is that there's no skill-based matchmaking.

175
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,180
Yeah, that's what I heard.

176
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,620
And it's like Overwatch and Call of Duty at the same time.

177
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,900
But I just don't like the pace.

178
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,940
How do you not like the pace if you've never played it yet?

179
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,600
I played the close beta.

180
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,460
Oh, yeah, you got into beta?

181
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,380
Oh, okay.

182
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,300
You think it's better than the beta?

183
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:01,880
I got into it twice.

184
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,760
I felt... I don't know.

185
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,340
Is it just me that I haven't been touching that game in a while?

186
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:07,620
Yeah.

187
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,140
It's like, it feels slower for some reason.

188
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,160
Or am I just... thinking?

189
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,460
I don't know.

190
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,360
I haven't tried it yet.

191
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:13,940
Where are you?

192
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,500
Where are you shooting?

193
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,440
Oh, my god.

194
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,700
You're literally on the tree!

195
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,940
Bro, I'm blind!

196
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,420
You're literally right in front of us, Tengen.

197
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,300
What the fuck?

198
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,540
That's why you're old.

199
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,500
I'm not old.

200
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,100
Yes, you are.

201
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,020
Why do you have white hair?

202
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,360
You.

203
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:30,600
Okay.

204
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,420
The stress from me.

205
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,760
We met, like, today.

206
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:35,460
What are you...

207
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:36,920
Yeah.

208
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,000
It took me two hours.

209
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,560
It took you two hours to have white hair?

210
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,260
Oh, my gosh.

211
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,120
What the fuck?

212
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,520
Oh, that's their whole team!

213
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,340
You can 1v3 that.

214
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,620
Hell!

215
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,880
What does that mean?

216
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,120
You're Tengen.

217
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,880
That's what I mean.

218
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,440
You'll be fine, right?

219
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,120
Yeah, see?

220
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,560
Wait, where's his teammate?

221
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,120
Nice.

222
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,620
Nice.

223
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,380
Nice, man.

224
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,500
That is a long finish.

225
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,500
Yeah, I was gonna say.

226
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,840
Bro took everything.

227
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:11,900
I killed him.

228
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,840
Bro, like, what the fuck's wrong with him?

229
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,040
Bro, I know, right?

230
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,000
This is why.

231
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
He took everything.

232
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,400
This is why, chat.

233
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,060
This is why.

234
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,840
This is why you have white hair.

235
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,380
This is why.

236
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,100
I can't believe that man would do that.

237
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,840
I haven't even debuted in just a second.

238
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:35,880
I'm hurting.

239
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,420
I'm getting white here.

240
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,440
We almost leaked his new...

241
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,980
It was close.

242
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,140
We almost leaked it.

243
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:48,280
You know, if he had all his stuff, he would have...

244
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:49,420
Gorillas.

245
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,140
Yeah, he would have gorilla debuted.

246
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,280
And I was like, do it.

247
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,760
He was like, shit-ass, and I was a bad influence.

248
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,780
I was like, you shit.

249
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,680
A bad idea is still an idea.

250
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,460
I mean, it would have been pretty cool.

251
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,360
It would have been funny.

252
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,220
I would have thought it would have been funny.

253
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,300
Why not?

254
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,440
Because you're like... it would be just be like... like first stream.

255
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,100
That's not like the fucking finals.

256
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,940
I like how your first stream, like back was the finals.

257
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,900
Like just some random tournament.

258
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:21,320
Yeah.

259
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,860
That was like...

260
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,640
Hi, I'm back.

261
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,840
I'm playing tournament now.

262
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,280
Yeah, yeah.

263
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,320
You're like, I'm back.

264
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,960
By the way, this is a tournament stream.

265
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,280
Dude, you wanna know what happened?

266
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:31,680
What?

267
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,340
Thing is, a friend of mine got like invited to a tournament.

268
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:35,960
Yeah.

269
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,600
And he was told like, hey, you should invite two more guys.

270
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,100
You're in.

271
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:39,940
Something like that.

272
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,140
It was like five minutes from the announcement.

273
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:42,920
Yeah.

274
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,540
Oh my God.

275
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,520
I was registered without even asked.

276
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:49,240
Two of us, me including the other teammate, was registered without being asked.

277
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,540
Oh, you were... they just registered you?

278
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,540
Knowing that we'd say yes.

279
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,660
They were just like, whatever, whatever.

280
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,220
Ten just gonna say yes anyway.

281
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:02,340
Crazy.

282
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,080
This guy.

283
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:03,860
Yeah.

284
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:07,160
So that means I can... Oh yeah, but yeah, I told him.

285
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,580
I told him like you were like one of the first subs for that Nokia tournament.

286
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:16,120
And then my chat, my chat said you got region locked in the IRL.

287
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,440
He actually got region locked IRL.

288
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:25,360
Do not, do not send stuff from international shipping to Indonesia.

289
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,160
Believe.

290
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:31,180
They're like, yeah, they're like, yeah, we don't know if he's gonna get in in time because of customs.

291
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,140
There's people in front of us.

292
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, someone's in front of us.

293
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,400
Yeah, wait, there's someone below?

294
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,020
What the fuck?

295
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:36,700
Someone's in front of you.

296
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,420
Yeah, what is he doing here?

297
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,160
Oh my God, where did this guy come from?

298
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:51,920
I thought it was like our decoy just now for some reason.

299
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,360
I was like, that had to be a decoy.

300
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,180
That was a chat.

301
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,580
I didn't see if you guys think if Tenjin's sound is okay.

302
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,120
Wait, where are you?

303
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,900
Oh, teammates over there.

304
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,060
They went over there.

305
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,540
Does this hit?

306
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,940
No, it doesn't hit.

307
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,720
Okay, I'm just gonna get closer.

308
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,660
It's okay.

309
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,920
They can't drop down now.

310
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,600
It's okay.

311
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,340
All right.

312
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,600
All right, I'll wait.

313
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,820
Okay, I'm heading up.

314
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,300
They ran.

315
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,300
Wait, no, they did.

316
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:25,760
On me?

317
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,560
Oh shit.

318
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,380
Hey, I got shot from behind.

319
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,400
It's okay.

320
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,300
I'm just gonna walk back.

321
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,340
Wait, I'm so safe.

322
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,740
I'm so safe.

323
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,660
Trust, trust, trust, trust.

324
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:37,980
Uh-huh.

325
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,420
Trust, trust, trust, trust, trust, trust.

326
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,560
Yeah, see, I told you.

327
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:44,680
Nice.

328
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,820
Always believe in me.

329
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:48,580
Oh.

330
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,220
Oh.

331
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,300
Okay, I'm Phoenix Kidd.

332
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,360
Let me know if they're pushing up.

333
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,240
I'm Phoenix Kidd.

334
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,360
Let me know.

335
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,980
Okay, that is...

336
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,580
Oh, okay.

337
00:12:59,020 --> 00:12:59,480
We're dead.

338
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,460
No, we're not.

339
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,480
Shit.

340
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:02,520
We're dead.

341
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,200
We're dead.

342
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,160
We're dead.

343
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:04,820
We're dead.

344
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,600
We're dead.

345
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:06,640
We're dead.

346
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:06,780
Oh, gosh.

347
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,140
Oh, my God.

348
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,500
Shoot the thing.

349
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,600
Oh, my God, shoot the thing.

350
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,080
Oh, God.

351
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:15,920
Oh.

352
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,040
Nexus.

353
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:17,520
Oh.

354
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,460
No.

355
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,500
Oh, shit.

356
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:19,700
What?

357
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,360
My...

358
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,200
What's wrong with my E?

359
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,520
Oh, oh, oh, oh, my God.

360
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,900
Mirage, please res me.

361
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,600
Mirage!

362
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,200
No!

363
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,260
Mirage!

364
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,660
You killed me, Mirage!

365
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,040
Okay, I'm Mirage.

366
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:32,320
Mirage.

367
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,380
This just fucking sucks.

368
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,160
I hate him.

369
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,580
I hate our Mirage.

370
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,960
Our Mirage is fucking terrible.

371
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,280
Wait, there's different teams?

372
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:41,940
Oh no.

373
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,540
No, no, no, no, no!

374
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:44,800
Nooooo!

375
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,600
Why did he not rez?

376
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,240
Okay.

377
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,500
Okay.

378
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,060
This Mirage is terrible.

379
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,580
This guy has 300 damage?

380
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,840
Bro, I'm lagging in my...

381
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,360
I'm getting more damage.

382
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,900
Is he crafting us?

383
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,860
Bro is not crafting us here.

384
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,540
He is crafting us.

385
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,900
He is crafting us.

386
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:09,680
Bro is not crafting us here and reviving us here.

387
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,000
Nooooo!

388
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,440
Why is he ulting?

389
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,380
Bro, is he...

390
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,600
Is he actually rezzing us here?

391
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,440
Bro, are you... I mean, he can do invisible.

392
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,260
Yeah, but why did he...

393
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,680
Why did he do that?

394
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,300
Nooooo way!

395
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,300
We're so fucked.

396
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:25,980
We're so fucked.

397
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,240
Nooooo way!

398
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,200
We're so fucked.

399
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,920
Oh no way!

400
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,660
We're so dead.

401
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,080
I hope they shoot you first.

402
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,760
No way!

403
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,580
Oh no, we're so fucked.

404
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,140
I love this.

405
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,400
They're gonna... They're flying!

406
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,380
They're flying!

407
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:41,840
Oh no!

408
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,080
Where are they flying?

409
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,240
Where are they flying?

410
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,720
I don't know.

411
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,400
Oh shit.

412
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,440
On us.

413
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,520
They're on us, aren't they?

414
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,520
They're on us, aren't they?

415
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,680
Are they on us?

416
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:53,860
Oh.

417
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,940
Wait, wait, wait.

418
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,940
We can get our stuff!

419
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,580
Wait, wait, wait.

420
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,080
We can get our stuff!

421
00:14:59,220 --> 00:14:59,660
They flew to him!

422
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,140
They flew to him!

423
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:01,820
Wait, he's dead!

424
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,000
Let's get our stuff!

425
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:03,600
Let's get our stuff!

426
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:04,640
Alright.

427
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,040
Alright.

428
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,560
Everything worked out.

429
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,120
Yeah, it all... Yeah, everything worked out for us.

430
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,380
We'll... We'll give it back to you, man.

431
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

432
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:16,660
We'll...

433
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,460
We'll be back.

434
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:18,900
Don't worry.

435
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,780
Double it and give it to the next person.

436
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

437
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,780
Double it and give it to the next person.

438
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:25,920
Don't worry.

439
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,280
We'll be there.

440
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,420
Oh, he's there in front of us.

441
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,540
Tengen, they're in front of us.

442
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,260
They literally flew to us.

443
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,320
They literally flew to us.

444
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,320
What did you do?!

445
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:39,480
That's crazy.

446
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,220
One's cracked.

447
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,540
One's cracked fully low.

448
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,500
Like, that's two shots directed.

449
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:44,580
You're good.

450
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,140
You're good.

451
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:45,380
You're good.

452
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:45,900
No, I'm not.

453
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,740
I don't feel good.

454
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,620
I don't feel good.

455
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,300
I don't feel good!

456
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:48,620
You're good.

457
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:48,640
You're good.

458
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:48,920
You're good.

459
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,920
I don't think we did it.

460
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,040
Yeah, we can just queue up.

461
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,700
Yeah, we can queue again.

462
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,460
Thank you, Apex.

463
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,120
Yeah, thank you.

464
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,180
So we don't have to...

465
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:04,340
Bro, they actually fucking blocked...

466
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,220
What the fuck?

467
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,840
What's wrong with them?

468
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,440
Freaks.

469
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,780
They're actual freaks.

470
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,840
Okay, to be fair, we had a terrible third.

471
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,900
Like, to be fair, our third was...

472
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,120
Maybe we needed a fourth.

473
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:22,180
Maybe we need a fourth player to make up for this mirage.

474
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:22,600
We do.

475
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,360
Oh, yeah, so...

476
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,280
Wait, so...

477
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,260
X to find, you just think it's way too slow?

478
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:32,740
Um...

479
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,640
I guess?

480
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,700
But, I mean, I'll give it a shot, right?

481
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,400
Yeah.

482
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,060
I'm down.

483
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,300
I was planning to download it.

484
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,920
Bro, let's fucking play it.

485
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:44,060
Let's do it next week.

486
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,700
For real?

487
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,540
Yeah, fucking let's do it!

488
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,680
Let's do it next week!

489
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:50,140
For real?

490
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,580
Yeah, we'll play on your servers.

491
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,480
Cause your internet's dog shit.

492
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:54,840
No shit.

493
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:07,600
Like, literally, last week, like, some cable on the ocean was like, broke down into like something, I guess.

494
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:07,620
Wait, what?

495
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:11,620
Yeah, so we got redirected to another whole server.

496
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,000
So we could not connect to Singapore.

497
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:13,420
What?

498
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:16,140
So there's a whole lot of latency for a couple of while.

499
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,140
Wait, was that for like Indonesia?

500
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:20,140
Only?

501
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,240
Uh...

502
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,000
I guess?

503
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,600
It happened for like five, four days.

504
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:26,880
Oh my god!

505
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,780
How do you live like that?

506
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,820
I can't...

507
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:35,000
I don't know, it's been decades.

508
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,920
I'm just like thinking like...

509
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,120
We had worse.

510
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,760
Oh my god!

511
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,040
We had worse.

512
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,780
Wait, so a shark bit the cable?

513
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,000
Probably.

514
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,420
What the fuck?

515
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:47,940
It happens.

516
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,460
We never knew what really happened.

517
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,220
That's crazy.

518
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,020
I just suddenly got emailed like, oh, something's wrong under the water.

519
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,660
What the fuck?

520
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:56,920
I'm sorry.

521
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,260
Here's a compensation.

522
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,140
Oh my god, and the server crashed.

523
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,440
Oh wait!

524
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,520
It's okay guys.

525
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,220
I thought that was my internet.

526
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,140
That was so funny.

527
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,020
That was my internet.

528
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,980
Oh no, the shark bit another cable.

529
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,020
Like, there's no way.

530
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,620
That was like the timing of that too.

531
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,380
I was like, there's no way.

532
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,640
A shark literally...

533
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,280
bit another cable.

534
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:26,720
Nice.

535
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,140
Okay.

536
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:32,920
Oh no.

537
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,120
That's not the gun I wanted.

538
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:36,820
Oh, what the fuck?

539
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,340
Oh, I might need help.

540
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:40,980
Oh wait.

541
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:42,900
No, he's low!

542
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,560
He's flashed!

543
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,140
He's flashed!

544
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,440
What the fuck?

545
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,020
What the fuck?

546
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,080
What?

547
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,640
Calm down.

548
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,960
Sorry, I was watching the horizon.

549
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,340
The horizon was pretty embarrassing.

550
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:00,360
What?

551
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,780
You were yelling at me and you were spectating at the wrong person?

552
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,220
Look, no, no, no.

553
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,680
I was still knocked, okay?

554
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:12,280
Look, I didn't realize you were not the horizon.

555
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,000
But you're playing...

556
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,940
Wait, what's her name again?

557
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:17,220
Alter?

558
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,380
What do you think about Alter?

559
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:21,880
It's fun.

560
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,660
Like, I can make portals randomly and people just get thrown off.

561
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,060
I feel like Alter...

562
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,540
I made a portal out of nowhere and they just go through it.

563
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,940
I feel like Alter, you need to have a good team to play with her.

564
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,820
Cause she's so...

565
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,260
Oh, she's...

566
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,180
This guy has bad connection.

567
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:40,960
Wait, what the fuck?

568
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,160
Who is that guy?

569
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,020
And got him?

570
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,560
He did?

571
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,200
I need a heal?

572
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:51,800
Oh!

573
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,300
I'm okay.

574
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,200
Can I swap?

575
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,620
Is there a swap?

576
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,020
One's knocked.

577
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,880
One left behind that stone.

578
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:02,920
Oh, there he is.

579
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:03,880
He got this, right?

580
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:08,020
Bro, I swear to fucking god.

581
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,340
I swear to fucking...

582
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,020
Okay, I have a gold red shield.

583
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,160
Yeah, that's why.

584
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,820
I literally just got it.

585
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,800
You don't even know.

586
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,140
Yeah, I know.

587
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:19,860
Don't worry about it.

588
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,380
I'm your teammate.

589
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,240
Sure.

590
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,080
There's a phoenix kit here.

591
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:24,980
Oh, you already have one.

592
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,180
Okay.

593
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,480
I'm using one right now.

594
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,120
Yay!

595
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,380
Where's that dude with the...

596
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:34,340
Freaking...

597
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,800
Whatever, hop up thing.

598
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:37,820
Alright, what's your...

599
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,220
Where are you planning on streaming now that you're back?

600
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,220
I gots to debut first.

601
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:44,820
At least.

602
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,780
You could be a PNG.

603
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,380
Forever?

604
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,500
No thanks.

605
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,900
Yeah, but you could be a PNG until you debut.

606
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,920
Because you don't know when you're debuting yet.

607
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,700
Maybe tomorrow.

608
00:20:59,180 --> 00:20:59,680
Wait, actually?

609
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,040
Wait, what?

610
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:04,640
So, like, legit, it's just a stinger.

611
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,960
It's just a stinger.

612
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,300
Yeah, I am.

613
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,860
But you don't know when that's gonna be.

614
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:15,780
You know, like, I bet, like, you can just debut without the stinger and then you just, like, it just shows up one day.

615
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,760
Yeah, I could do that.

616
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,680
Because the intro and the outro is done.

617
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,400
Yeah, it's just the stinger, yeah?

618
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,180
Yeah.

619
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,540
I know what it looks like, chat.

620
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,980
I know what it looks like.

621
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:28,580
No you don't.

622
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,180
Yes I do.

623
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,240
No you don't.

624
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,220
Guys, it has white hair.

625
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:37,800
No.

626
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,480
I shouldn't make you bet.

627
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,280
Like, you don't deserve that.

628
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,940
What if I change my hair color?

629
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,380
You would change the hair color just to spite me?

630
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,360
Just to fuck with me?

631
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,080
Yeah, I'm against you.

632
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,240
That's so fucked up, man.

633
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,040
That's so fucked up.

634
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,480
Yeah, hell.

635
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,120
Yeah, he's like an old...

636
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,360
Oh yeah, you're...

637
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,660
I shouldn't reveal your lore yet.

638
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,300
Because it's a secret.

639
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:05,560
I have a lore?

640
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,240
It's crazy.

641
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,140
Yes you did.

642
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,520
You fucking told me the lore.

643
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,420
I didn't.

644
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,220
Yes you did.

645
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,240
Nuh uh.

646
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,120
I can say it right now and...

647
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,200
Hell.

648
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,900
I can say it right now.

649
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,000
Nuh uh.

650
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,460
What lore?

651
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,800
Are you gonna bait me?

652
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,960
What are you talking about?

653
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:29,400
Yeah, bro.

654
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,700
Don't fucking...

655
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,620
Don't bait me because now I really want to say it.

656
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,300
Yeah, yeah.

657
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:36,780
Hell.

658
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,820
Anyway, he's gonna be like...

659
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,960
I don't know if you guys know, but he's really old.

660
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,200
And um...

661
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,900
Man, I'm dead.

662
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,120
He's like an old grandpa.

663
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,120
And like in his lore...

664
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,140
He has like white hair.

665
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,620
It's always about the white hair.

666
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:03,440
It's the only thing he can say that won't actually leak anywhere.

667
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:03,600
It's the only thing he can say that won't actually leak anywhere.

668
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,740
That's honestly true.

669
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,820
Oh my god.

670
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,920
That's all you guys need to know.

671
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,440
People didn't know...

672
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,960
That I'm an old guy.

673
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,440
That's the thing, man.

674
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,360
Yeah, so old.

675
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:20,400
You're not supposed to know you're old?

676
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,180
Then change your hair color.

677
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,600
I'm 12.

678
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,460
Seconds away from dying.

679
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,380
Oh my god.

680
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,520
To be fair, when are you like...

681
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,760
Not dying though.

682
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:33,440
To be fair.

683
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:33,920
I'm a sleeve.

684
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,760
Good question.

685
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:40,160
I feel like after... maybe you won't even get a stream tomorrow.

686
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,880
Because you're gonna fucking...

687
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,280
Jesus Christ.

688
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,320
You're hoping me to die?

689
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:46,780
What?

690
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,060
No!

691
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,660
I'm just talking about the odds.

692
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,940
The odds of that happening, you know?

693
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,380
The odds of me dying...

694
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,720
Because of natural causes is way smaller...

695
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:56,600
It's like way...

696
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,420
Than getting into an accident.

697
00:23:58,860 --> 00:23:59,900
Okay, I'm just saying.

698
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,780
Putting it out there.

699
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,100
I'm just saying.

700
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:06,900
Just don't go outside.

701
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,180
Yeah, just like... imagine.

702
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,820
There's like a random shark just jumping at me.

703
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,980
Just don't go outside, Tenjin.

704
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:14,840
Then you'll be fine.

705
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,460
But I like touching the grass.

706
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,060
No you don't.

707
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,160
What do you mean?

708
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,980
You assume I just stay at home?

709
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:27,760
If you had a choice, You would 100% just stay at home.

710
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,760
What do you mean?

711
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:30,940
Honestly, you're right.

712
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:31,180
I'm just saying.

713
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,560
There's no fucking way.

714
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,920
You hate going out.

715
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,080
Honestly, you're right.

716
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,700
I can't refute that.

717
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,200
Bro, okay, I was gonna say.

718
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:45,080
Even though I know you for like a couple of days.

719
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,340
A couple of days.

720
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,720
Just a couple of days.

721
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,240
I know that you do not like to go outside.

722
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,700
From those experiences from a couple of days.

723
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,140
Guys, just you know.

724
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,200
She's saying I'm a virgin, Chet.

725
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,600
Yeah, that too.

726
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,520
I mean, it's true.

727
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,360
That's crazy.

728
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,940
He's a fucking wizard.

729
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,860
She called me a fucking virgin.

730
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:07,580
That's crazy.

731
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,140
No, no.

732
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,480
It's called a wizard.

733
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:12,200
You're like a level 100 wizard right now.

734
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,520
You don't want to break that streak.

735
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,240
She's calling me old now.

736
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,780
I've been calling you old since the stream started.

737
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,240
My title is literally grandpa.

738
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,020
It's literally carrying this old grandpa.

739
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,280
Where are we going?

740
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:29,780
I don't know.

741
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,620
I see nothing.

742
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,280
I don't want to be outside of the zone.

743
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,260
That's stupid.

744
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,160
That's true.

745
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,640
Is she wrong?

746
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,680
Is she?

747
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:42,660
Damn.

748
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,820
Even the chats are against me now.

749
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,260
Look what you did.

750
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,440
Yay!

751
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,760
I did my job.

752
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,380
Influencer.

753
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,100
Yeah, I'm an influencer, guys.

754
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,520
Double it and give it to the next one.

755
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,520
I'm an influencer.

756
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,880
Wait, were you watching that part in Rust?

757
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:03,940
Is that why?

758
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,240
The part where I was like, hello, I'm an influencer.

759
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,620
I think I was.

760
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,340
I was smoking outside.

761
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,520
I was like, why were you...

762
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:16,460
You were smoking outside just watching me fuck around in Rust.

763
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,220
You were smoking outside just watching me fuck around in Rust.

764
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:20,940
Okay, again, I miscalculated the stream time and my sleep time.

765
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:21,540
Okay, again, I miscalculated the stream time and my sleep time.

766
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:21,560
Yeah.

767
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,240
It's time to stream.

768
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,360
I woke up.

769
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,360
It's 2AM.

770
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:27,680
What happened?

771
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,080
What am I gonna do?

772
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,120
What the fuck?

773
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:31,920
This guy just...

774
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:34,220
Yeah, yeah, he had white armor.

775
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,940
By the way, there's another team up the hill.

776
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,200
I was not...

777
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,660
I thought you don't like being outside the zone.

778
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:41,080
Yeah, but like we can gatekeep them.

779
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,580
Or I could put a nexus.

780
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,380
Oh, true, true, true.

781
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,080
You're so smart.

782
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:46,900
I forgot about that.

783
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:51,400
I don't know if they're still there, but I saw them chilling up there.

784
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,560
I don't know if they're still there, but I saw them chilling up there.

785
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,920
Yeah, my MrBeast arc.

786
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,440
Just double it.

787
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,300
Double it and give it to the next one.

788
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,260
Oh, shit.

789
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,240
The ring is even like...

790
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:00,920
You sure about this?

791
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,100
I mean, it's round two.

792
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,920
I think there are two that are left.

793
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:06,200
They're not!

794
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,140
They're not!

795
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:07,440
They're not!

796
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,440
You big liar.

797
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:11,800
You big liar.

798
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,200
Oh my god!

799
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,440
I'm not a liar!

800
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,620
I just didn't know!

801
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,100
You big lie man.

802
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,780
Oh my god.

803
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,920
I mean, you killed all of them.

804
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,800
Fuck you going to the nexus.

805
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,080
I wiped the whole tour.

806
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,620
Yeah, I'm going to the nexus.

807
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,400
Bye.

808
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,140
I gotta loot all this stuff first though.

809
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,400
I think there's another team near us.

810
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,080
Yeah, there should be at least.

811
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,080
Alright, I'm going back.

812
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,240
This shit hurts, yo.

813
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,020
Yeah, it's round two though.

814
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:37,860
It's not that bad.

815
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,460
I wanna see another team though near us.

816
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,240
Yay!

817
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,780
Oh, ow, ow, ow.

818
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,560
I don't have a medkit?

819
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,320
I'm fucked.

820
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:48,680
You don't have syringes?

821
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,160
I have syringes, but not medkits.

822
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,660
Oh, you almost timed that wrong.

823
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:56,940
Yeah.

824
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,620
I predicted it wrong.

825
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,200
Yeah.

826
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:03,800
Oh, hey look.

827
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,160
There should be meds here.

828
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,140
I'm going to grab some syringes.

829
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,580
Oh, okay.

830
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,260
I found three fucking bats instead.

831
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,120
If you want.

832
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,680
I need medkits and syringes.

833
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,080
Yeah, I...

834
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,240
This is my last one.

835
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,380
I have one syringe here.

836
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,200
You know what?

837
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:19,920
Fuck it.

838
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:20,940
Let's do this.

839
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,060
I know there was one behind the tower.

840
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,080
I know there was one behind us, but I'm lazy.

841
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,560
I'm too lazy to take that.

842
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,440
I'm too lazy to walk behind us.

843
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:30,760
I'm going to go to zone.

844
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,160
That's crazy.

845
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,660
Oh, I'm going to go to zone.

846
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:36,740
Wait.

847
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Behind us?

848
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:38,660
Up top?

849
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,160
Oh shit.

850
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:41,560
Oh shit.

851
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,540
Why am I being shot at?

852
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,020
Behind us.

853
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,960
Just don't let them break our armor.

854
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,760
Just don't let them break our armor.

855
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,760
Then we'll have a...

856
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:52,700
Significant advantage.

857
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:53,360
Yeah.

858
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,940
Because we just don't have heals.

859
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:55,880
That's really it.

860
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,180
As long as they don't break our armor, we're fine.

861
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,040
Where are they shooting us from?

862
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:01,920
From that room.

863
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,420
What the fuck is wrong with them?

864
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,280
What?

865
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,260
What am I looking at?

866
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,700
Where's the other team then?

867
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,680
Okay, they're behind a shield.

868
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,640
I ain't fighting that.

869
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,920
Yeah, I'm not fighting that.

870
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:13,480
That's stupid.

871
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,620
They're behind a shield.

872
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,160
I'm not doing that.

873
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,940
I broke their shield.

874
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,840
They're shooting me without it now because I broke...

875
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:24,940
They're shooting me without it now because I broke...

876
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,140
Wait, someone died to ring.

877
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,420
Wait, what?

878
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,840
The other team is dying to ring.

879
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:33,400
The other team is dying to ring.

880
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,480
What the fuck?

881
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,020
What the fuck?

882
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,280
Yeah, because they're the ones two hours left.

883
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,000
Yeah, but who's the ring people?

884
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,140
Yeah, but who's the ring people?

885
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:44,600
Don't ask me.

886
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:44,880
What the fuck?

887
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,640
What are we ever gonna do?

888
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,560
We just wait.

889
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,020
This is...

890
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,180
They have to come to us.

891
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,460
Yeah, see they're over here, left side.

892
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,560
I told you.

893
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,460
Oh, that is super low.

894
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,120
I told you.

895
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,200
They just have to come to us.

896
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:01,460
Perfect made.

897
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,040
No?

898
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:02,960
Nevermind.

899
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:04,580
Flesh?

900
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,120
No, it...

901
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,540
That's not reachable?

902
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,080
I'm just gonna push up a little.

903
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,300
Oh, one is up here, by the way.

904
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:18,800
Oh, one is up here, by the way.

905
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,200
Wait, this is two different teams.

906
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:23,840
I just realized.

907
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,660
One is above us and the other one is to our left.

908
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:28,240
One is above us and the other one is to our left.

909
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:28,620
Uh...

910
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,880
Oh shit, that's me.

911
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,320
Yeah.

912
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,020
Why are they...

913
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,960
So one is like up here.

914
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,280
There's so much stuff.

915
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,880
It's fine, we'll be fine, right?

916
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,280
We'll be fine, right?

917
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,100
Are we?

918
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,140
We'll be fine, right?

919
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,360
I believe in us.

920
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,120
Oh shit!

921
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:48,880
Okay.

922
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,500
That guy was stupid.

923
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,240
Help me over here.

924
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,540
With this guy.

925
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,960
I can't climb.

926
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,420
There's a reason why.

927
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,720
Alright, I'm gonna take his loot then.

928
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:00,840
Wait, what?

929
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,520
Who's this guy?

930
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,760
He's just... he's just you.

931
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,280
Who's this guy?

932
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,300
Alright.

933
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,340
Where did he come from?

934
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,120
Okay, I'm just gonna heal.

935
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,240
You're fine, right?

936
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,500
I'm fine.

937
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,160
I'm fine.

938
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,860
Okay, I'm gonna take his... I'm gonna loot then.

939
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,600
Are you still fine?

940
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,820
Oh my god, he went down.

941
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,060
Wait, where's the last guy then?

942
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:28,700
Don't know.

943
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:30,300
You're alive?

944
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,940
I wouldn't even know.

945
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,000
I don't know where he is.

946
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,240
I swear I saw some guy here.

947
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,220
Where the fuck did he go?

948
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:42,560
Okay.

949
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,000
What the fuck?

950
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,680
Where did he go?

951
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:50,700
Oh.

952
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:50,980
Oh.

953
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:51,300
Wait.

954
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,000
Oh he's behind.

955
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:52,320
Wait.

956
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:52,940
That's the whole team!

957
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:53,480
That's the whole team!

958
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,220
That's the whole team.

959
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:54,660
That's the whole team.

960
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:55,100
Please!

961
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,460
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.

962
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:57,560
Don't let them push.

963
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,060
Don't let them push.

964
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,580
Where did this team come from?

965
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:01,960
OH.

966
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:02,740
I'M DEAD!

967
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,040
I'M DEAD!

968
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,100
I'm dead I'm dead I'm dead!

969
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,120
Peek me!

970
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,920
I'm not dead I'm not dead.

971
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:10,560
Knocked one.

972
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:13,740
I'm not dead.

973
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:13,740
I'm dead.

974
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,840
I'm gonna go for this guy.

975
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:19,810
There's one.

976
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:22,430
Behind you, behind you.

977
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:23,250
I know I need to...

978
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:24,490
Okay, I got one.

979
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,490
I'm gonna have to flourish this guy.

980
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:25,930
I'm gonna thirst him.

981
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:26,730
He's right here.

982
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:27,110
He's right here.

983
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:28,490
I'm gonna thirst him though.

984
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,070
Okay, I'm getting over.

985
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:33,010
Don't die!

986
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,130
I'm here.

987
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:37,450
Okay, he thirsted him too.

988
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:39,330
There's no way he wins this 1v2.

989
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:41,190
Yeah, he's won.

990
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:43,090
Nice.

991
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:44,310
See?

992
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:44,930
Aw.

993
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,050
He said sorry.

994
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:46,490
Hell yeah.

995
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:47,770
You better be...

996
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:51,170
Whatdo you, what'd he say?

997
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,070
He said sorry.

998
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:54,630
Oh my God.

999
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:56,630
Oh my God.

1000
00:32:59,170 --> 00:32:59,850
Oh.

1001
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:00,530
My.

1002
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:00,850
God.

1003
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:03,670
Wow.

1004
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:08,010
My God, he was stream sniping us!

1005
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:09,330
Tenshin.

1006
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:11,590
Oh my God!

1007
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:12,230
This guy!

1008
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,270
SEEDOON!

1009
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,170
You're gonna stream Sniperz?

1010
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:17,130
You should have had more than 1k damage.

1011
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:17,570
Not gonna lie.

1012
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:23,550
This is a little embarrassing.

1013
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:24,370
That's true.

1014
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:28,090
You don't know if he's a dragoon.

1015
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:30,950
He could be like whatever the fuck Tengen's chat is.

1016
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:32,390
What do you call your chat?

1017
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:35,310
Bro...

1018
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:36,950
What do you call your chat?

1019
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:39,310
I have yet to reveal that just yet.

1020
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:40,070
Reveal?

1021
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,570
Let's do it now.

1022
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:43,130
No.

1023
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:43,390
No.

1024
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:44,630
Why not?

1025
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,190
It would be like an exclusive.

1026
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:47,870
Hell no.

1027
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:50,090
Anjing.

1028
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,210
Is it Anjing?

1029
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:57,930
What does that mean?

1030
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:59,630
Tengen, I've never heard that before.

1031
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:00,690
What does that really mean?

1032
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:02,270
Yeah, I've never heard that.

1033
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:05,650
It means a dog or a bitch.

1034
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:07,810
Oh yeah, how do you say that fully?

1035
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:13,010
How do you say that fully?

1036
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:14,830
Tengen?

1037
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:16,770
Yeah.

1038
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:19,450
Anjing.

1039
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:21,010
Anjing what?

1040
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:22,330
Anjing.

1041
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:23,310
Anjing.

1042
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:24,630
Isn't there more to that?

1043
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,670
I'm pretty sure that was...

1044
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:28,690
Really?

1045
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:29,490
Really?

1046
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:30,750
There's no need to...

1047
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:31,430
Is there not?

1048
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:33,990
Probably not.

1049
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:35,470
Chat, is that...

1050
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:36,330
Is that true?

1051
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,110
There are people who look at your chat.

1052
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:42,790
Your chat would tell the truth.

1053
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:43,110
Yeah.

1054
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:45,270
Your chat would tell the truth.

1055
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:46,230
Alright.

1056
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:46,710
No.

1057
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:48,050
Nah.

1058
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:49,650
Yeah?

1059
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:50,550
Anjing what?

1060
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:51,870
My chat's a gaslighter.

1061
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:52,130
Anjing.

1062
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:53,250
An...

1063
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,190
Nah.

1064
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:59,090
Wait, do you call your chat Anjing now?

1065
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:00,790
Nah.

1066
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:01,590
Sometimes, yeah.

1067
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,190
Oh my god, you call your chat dogs?

1068
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:05,250
Yeah.

1069
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:07,350
Sometimes.

1070
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:09,690
Maybe they like it.

1071
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:11,470
They have to behave like a puppy.

1072
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:12,330
Yeah, they do.

1073
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:12,950
Maybe they like it.

1074
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:13,090
Maybe they like it.

1075
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:14,310
I'm sure they do.

1076
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,270
I'm sure they do.

1077
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:20,730
Tenjin's Anjing's.

1078
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:26,710
Guys, I can't get in trouble because it's Tenjin's fault.

1079
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:28,470
What?

1080
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,610
It's not my fault.

1081
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:31,670
I'm just trying to learn.

1082
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:35,730
I'm just trying to learn.

1083
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:36,010
Nah, it was never my fault.

1084
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:38,870
My behavior is mostly because of my friends.

1085
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:40,450
Me too.

1086
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:41,150
So I blame my friends.

1087
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:42,230
Yeah, I blame...

1088
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:43,930
blame my friends too.

1089
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:46,070
Thank God we just met each other.

1090
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:46,970
Yeah, thank God we just met.

1091
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:47,710
So we're not friends.

1092
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:48,490
We...

1093
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,310
We're just acquaintances guys.

1094
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:54,390
Well...

1095
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:56,410
Akquaintance.

1096
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:57,010
Yeah.

1097
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:57,310
I'm just saying.

1098
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:57,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1099
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:59,330
We were just randos.

1100
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:03,310
Yeah, we were just randos and we just want to win some Apex games, you know.

1101
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:04,410
We like Apex.

1102
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:06,770
Yeah, we're just like damn, you're so good at Apex.

1103
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:11,290
Like you wanna like fucking do a collab, so we can boost our win rates.

1104
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:11,690
Nemesis's.

1105
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:15,290
Oh, I got the wrong person with that.

1106
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:15,890
Oops.

1107
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:17,950
Hope you don't die.

1108
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:20,710
Heading over?

1109
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:22,910
Wait, there's a guy right here in front of me.

1110
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,110
Yeah, someone's on you.

1111
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:25,870
Were you champions?

1112
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:28,770
What the fuck?

1113
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:29,570
Was I?

1114
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:31,650
Oh my god!

1115
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:34,490
I couldn't even look!

1116
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,270
I'm so fucked.

1117
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:37,470
Alright.

1118
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:41,830
Yeah, that guy instantly killed me.

1119
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,150
It was actually crazy.

1120
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:45,250
I literally looked up and got beaten.

1121
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:47,610
Wait.

1122
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:49,470
Oh my god, maybe he'll rez me too.

1123
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:51,090
I got scammed?

1124
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:52,950
I'm safe though.

1125
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:53,710
I'm really safe.

1126
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:54,790
I'm really safe, Tangent.

1127
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:55,570
I'm really safe.

1128
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:57,090
Okay, you're dead.

1129
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:59,110
I'm still very safe.

1130
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,190
Wait, did he thirst again?

1131
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,070
There's a whole different team.

1132
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:03,830
Oh, rez.

1133
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:07,370
I'm safe for rez.

1134
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:08,830
No lie.

1135
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:11,690
Do you think he'll rez me?

1136
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:12,650
Oh, he got peacekeep.

1137
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:13,930
Okay, he's fucking dead.

1138
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:14,150
Boom!

1139
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:15,830
Wait, wait, he won that.

1140
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:16,410
Oh, he's dead.

1141
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:17,590
There's two shotguns in that team.

1142
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:17,750
There's no way.

1143
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:20,510
He should have rez'd.

1144
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,250
He should have rez'd.

1145
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:25,230
We would have fucking helped him.

1146
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,530
We would have, yes.

1147
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:28,370
Yeah!

1148
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:29,730
Wait, I have an idea.

1149
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:31,450
You have zero damage.

1150
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:34,450
Okay, I literally looked up and died.

1151
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,250
That's not fair.

1152
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:37,450
I literally looked up and died.

1153
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:38,430
Welcome to my servers.

1154
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:43,390
No, in NA, we would have fucking died so fast.

1155
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:46,150
That's where all the ruler players live.

1156
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:48,730
You know that.

1157
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:49,750
You played NA servers.

1158
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:51,670
No, I have not.

1159
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:52,250
Yes, you have.

1160
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:53,770
I have not.

1161
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:54,870
What are you talking about?

1162
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:55,770
Oh, true, true, true.

1163
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:57,610
Sorry, I was thinking about somebody else.

1164
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:59,730
We met in... I think we met in Tokyo.

1165
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:03,510
Like, we met like the day before your final... the finals tournament.

1166
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:05,370
And that's why I was lurking in his chat.

1167
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:09,010
If you guys want a timeline of everything.

1168
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:09,810
You're stretching it.

1169
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:12,730
Yeah, that's our timeline.

1170
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:16,510
That's the canon event.

1171
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:17,790
Right.

1172
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:20,990
Yeah, yeah, and we met on like Tokyo servers, right?

1173
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:21,930
Mm-hmm.

1174
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:27,110
Yeah, yeah, so it was on Tokyo servers that we bumped into each other.

1175
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:28,630
And then like...

1176
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:29,610
Coincidentally, it was off stream.

1177
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:30,750
Yeah, it was off stream.

1178
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:31,910
I was like, real Doki?

1179
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:32,810
Yeah, and then...

1180
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:33,030
No way.

1181
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,010
Oh my god, yeah.

1182
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:36,270
And he's like a huge fan of me, by the way.

1183
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:38,390
So, he's actually a Dragoon.

1184
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:39,810
He's been like a...

1185
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:41,850
Like a...

1186
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:44,470
He's been a Dragoon member for like...

1187
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,310
How many months now?

1188
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:46,370
Five months, right?

1189
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:48,970
Why don't you prove it in chat right now?

1190
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:51,250
In my chat and type, show your membership badge.

1191
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:52,890
And show that it's real.

1192
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,630
Hey, aren't you a member?

1193
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:56,250
Mm-hmm.

1194
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:57,050
Was.

1195
00:38:58,270 --> 00:38:59,490
Was what happened?

1196
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,390
We became friends.

1197
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:03,910
Oh, I thought we were acquaintances.

1198
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:09,630
We became friends.

1199
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:12,230
Oh yeah, we just became friends like right now.

1200
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:14,090
So, he un-membered.

1201
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:16,050
I can be a fan and a friend at the same time.

1202
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,230
Yeah, so why aren't you membering?

1203
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:21,090
I need to pay my electricity bills.

1204
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:23,970
Okay, true, true.

1205
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:25,290
All right, don't worry.

1206
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:26,510
You can never die now.

1207
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:29,010
You think my water bills are like...

1208
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:32,130
Crazy.

1209
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:33,630
That's crazy.

1210
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:35,750
Damn, you got me there.

1211
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:42,210
Yeah, he had to cancel his membership to me because he had to pay his bills.

1212
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:43,090
Yeah.

1213
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:49,610
It's okay guys.

1214
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:54,750
So like guys, that means like...

1215
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:59,830
Guys, you have to superchat to Tenjin so that he can afford to member.

1216
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:07,830
Guys, I need him to member to me so...

1217
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:12,750
Why do you want me to member you?

1218
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:15,150
I have your chat open.

1219
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:16,850
Someone literally gave you a superchat.

1220
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:17,210
It's time.

1221
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:19,770
Why you have my chat open?

1222
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:23,450
That's so... what?

1223
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:24,670
Hey...

1224
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:25,810
That's crazy.

1225
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:27,530
Because you said you couldn't afford it.

1226
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:30,550
You said you couldn't afford it.

1227
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:31,370
So now you should...

1228
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,790
You should be able to afford it now, right?

1229
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:35,390
Unless you were lying to me.

1230
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:38,910
I would never lie to you.

1231
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:39,850
Alright, member me right now.

1232
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:44,270
I'm in Apex.

1233
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:45,490
Do you expect me to member you?

1234
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:46,150
Oh, don't worry.

1235
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:49,030
At the end of the stream, we're gonna watch you member me, right?

1236
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:51,450
What?

1237
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:55,330
What is that statement, man?

1238
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:57,210
Join Tomato Farm.

1239
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:57,570
What?

1240
00:40:59,410 --> 00:40:59,810
Nah...

1241
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:03,230
People are pressuring me to do this now, huh?

1242
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:06,010
Your pressure is okay sometimes.

1243
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:08,050
Sometimes?

1244
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:09,450
Sometimes?

1245
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:10,370
Oh, you're right.

1246
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:11,270
All the time.

1247
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:11,910
You're right.

1248
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:14,630
All the time.

1249
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:19,990
There's like a huge fight going on in front of me, by the way.

1250
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:21,910
There's like a huge fight going on in front of me, by the way.

1251
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:23,170
Don't worry.

1252
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:23,770
I'm lifelike.

1253
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:26,450
If you go there and die, and then I rez you just like Mercy.

1254
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:28,910
Die, I have rez.

1255
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,830
What the fuck is going on?

1256
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:33,470
What the fuck is going on?

1257
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:34,290
What are you doing?

1258
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:35,450
You have a healer drone.

1259
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:36,190
You deserve it.

1260
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:36,930
I... yeah.

1261
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:38,510
You deserve this.

1262
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:39,170
Oh, in front of me?

1263
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:41,190
In front of me?

1264
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:41,530
In front of me?

1265
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:43,030
Okay, okay.

1266
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:45,210
Knocked one.

1267
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:48,950
Second person is here.

1268
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:50,510
Second person is here.

1269
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,850
What is he doing here?

1270
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,090
Got the second one.

1271
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:56,110
Engine, die!

1272
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:56,430

1273
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:00,850
Die, I have rez!

1274
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:02,190
Just like Overwatch.

1275
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:05,530
What are you just like Overwatch at?

1276
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:06,850
I'm more like Mercy.

1277
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:07,930
I've never played Overwatch.

1278
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:08,770
What the fuck do you do?

1279
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,670
I've never played Overwatch.

1280
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:12,410
What are you talking about?

1281
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,410
How do you know that?

1282
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:15,930
Die, I have rez.

1283
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:17,290
Just like Marble Rivals.

1284
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:20,690
And you know you can't say you don't have it.

1285
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:21,050
You don't.

1286
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:24,050
Okay, okay.

1287
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:25,410
You can't lie.

1288
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:27,410
I don't know why you can't lie.

1289
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:30,450
Because I gave him a fucking code for Marble Rivals.

1290
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:33,130
Yes, I'm calling you out.

1291
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:35,650
I gave this man a fucking code for Marble Rivals.

1292
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:37,030
So you can't lie about it.

1293
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:38,770
So you can't lie about it.

1294
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:39,430
What?

1295
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:42,970
You sold your soul to me now.

1296
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:43,250
You sold your soul to me now.

1297
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:44,870
Bro!

1298
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:45,350
Yeah?

1299
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:47,690
Yeah, yeah.

1300
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:49,050
This is your fault.

1301
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:51,190
No, I know you said you want a code for Marble Rivals.

1302
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:53,510
No, this is your fault.

1303
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:54,410
Someone sent a red.

1304
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:55,490
Oh, someone sent a red.

1305
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:57,550
You know what to do.

1306
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:00,270
This is your fault.

1307
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:01,630
How is that my fault?

1308
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:02,890
I'm doing this.

1309
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:03,870
What the fuck?

1310
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:04,550
You're a scam.

1311
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:07,850
I can't believe it.

1312
00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:09,270
This guy scammed me.

1313
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:10,550
No, no, no.

1314
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:11,750
Hail.

1315
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:15,050
Where's membership?

1316
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:16,470
I haven't even debuted yet.

1317
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:17,350
Where's membership?

1318
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:21,650
That's... man.

1319
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:22,010
Damn.

1320
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:24,190
What?

1321
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:25,850
Where are we going?

1322
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:26,810
I don't know.

1323
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:28,110
I'm fucking Lifeline.

1324
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:29,190
Your IGF.

1325
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:30,570
I'm Lifeline.

1326
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:32,110
Okay, we're following the Bangalore.

1327
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:33,430
Okay, you so nasty.

1328
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:35,190
Why?

1329
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:37,390
That's the guy's name.

1330
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:38,690
What do you mean why?

1331
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:40,770
That's literally the guy's name.

1332
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:41,710
Oh, that's the guy's name?

1333
00:43:41,770 --> 00:43:42,330
I'm streamer mode.

1334
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:43,810
Oh, you're streamer mode.

1335
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:45,210
Why are you streamer mode?

1336
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:46,210
Why?

1337
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:47,630
Are you scared of dying?

1338
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:48,630
No.

1339
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:53,770
What are you doing?

1340
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:54,970
Get your shit off streamer mode.

1341
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:56,150
What are you scared of?

1342
00:43:57,590 --> 00:43:59,590
What are you laughing about?

1343
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:03,150
What are you scared of?

1344
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:04,470
No, no, no.

1345
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:05,070
Don't worry about it.

1346
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:05,530
What are you doing?

1347
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:07,350
I'm fucking pulling up your stream right now.

1348
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:08,610
Nothing.

1349
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:09,550
Nothing.

1350
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:11,890
There's nothing.

1351
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:12,710
There's nothing.

1352
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:13,750
What are you doing?

1353
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:14,790
Nothing.

1354
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:16,090
No, I didn't do anything.

1355
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:20,590
Don't worry about it.

1356
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:23,070
They don't really like it.

1357
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:23,790
Nothing.

1358
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:28,610
I didn't do anything.

1359
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:29,710
Trust me.

1360
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:30,630
You did something.

1361
00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:32,390
You fucking did something.

1362
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:33,750
I didn't do anything.

1363
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:35,570
Why you don't trust me?

1364
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:36,650
We literally just met.

1365
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:37,490
You don't trust me.

1366
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:41,010
I do trust you to the point where I cannot trust you.

1367
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:42,930
Because I trust you to not trust.

1368
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:44,770
That's how hard it is.

1369
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:46,610
For real.

1370
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:48,610
For real.

1371
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:49,710
Oh my god.

1372
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:49,970
Wait.

1373
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:50,890
Let's see.

1374
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:51,630
Oh wait.

1375
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:52,170
I have a...

1376
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:54,090
I have a package.

1377
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:56,730
Where the fuck are people though?

1378
00:44:58,110 --> 00:44:58,510
Oh.

1379
00:44:58,510 --> 00:44:58,990
Oh I see them.

1380
00:44:59,050 --> 00:44:59,250
I see them.

1381
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:02,070
Cracked one.

1382
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:02,570
You just have to ask.

1383
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:06,530
They're like all the way over to the other side.

1384
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:09,230
What do we have here?

1385
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:10,530
Someone's flying.

1386
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:10,850
Just bats.

1387
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:11,410
Wait.

1388
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:11,650
Is there?

1389
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:12,110
Oh wait.

1390
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:13,590
They are.

1391
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:15,730
That's the team I like cracked I think.

1392
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:16,910
Yeah they are.

1393
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:18,870
Wait.

1394
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:19,150
Where?

1395
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:20,290
I don't see them.

1396
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:22,970
Where did they fly?

1397
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:23,450
Oh I see them.

1398
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:23,750
I see them.

1399
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:27,310
Do we have...

1400
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:28,050
Do I have ammo?

1401
00:45:28,070 --> 00:45:28,570
I need ammo.

1402
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:29,810
What kind of ammo do you need?

1403
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:31,990
Blue armor?

1404
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:32,530
Red?

1405
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:34,570
I'm doing season 3 meta.

1406
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:35,990
Wait.

1407
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:36,350
PK.

1408
00:45:36,610 --> 00:45:38,530
Oh you're doing PK wingman.

1409
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:39,290
I fucking knew it.

1410
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:41,050
Like the moment he said season 3.

1411
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:42,470
I fucking knew it was PK.

1412
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:44,030
I don't even remember the dictionary.

1413
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:47,470
Bro season 3 is...

1414
00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:50,450
Season 3 and 4 were my friend out like...

1415
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:51,530
Like friend years.

1416
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:54,870
A fucking course I remember is season 3 fucking meta.

1417
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:55,790
Oh my god.

1418
00:45:55,850 --> 00:45:57,910
That shit is ingrained in my mind.

1419
00:45:58,410 --> 00:45:58,910
You were...

1420
00:45:59,810 --> 00:46:00,610
Over here.

1421
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:03,250
And to my right as well.

1422
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:05,030
There's like... I don't know if it's the same team.

1423
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:07,230
Shit.

1424
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:09,610
You should craft some... You can craft some ammo.

1425
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:12,410
I thought I cracked something already dude.

1426
00:46:12,590 --> 00:46:13,570
I thought I cracked something already dude.

1427
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:14,410
Probably.

1428
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:17,970
I mean they're playing Gibby.

1429
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:19,290
And Octane.

1430
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:20,390
Why are they playing Gibby?

1431
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:21,770
I never see Gibby anymore.

1432
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:22,510
I swear to god.

1433
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:23,970
Cause isn't it...

1434
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:26,590
What do I move?

1435
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:27,490
What are they doing?

1436
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:28,710
Do you see that Gibby not moving?

1437
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:32,470
Is that Gibby just chilling there behind the rock?

1438
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:34,350
Oh it's cause there's a new team.

1439
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:36,450
Yeah this Gibby is so...

1440
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:38,850
Oh my god.

1441
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:40,450
This Gibby is so fucked.

1442
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:42,170
Um...

1443
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:43,470
Like a Nexus.

1444
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:45,990
I'm gonna... Yeah get that Nexus in.

1445
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:48,090
Uhhh...

1446
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:49,550
Okay let's go.

1447
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:51,550
You go first.

1448
00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:52,750
Wait you have a user portal.

1449
00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:55,810
Wait can I... Does it even go through that?

1450
00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:58,010
Oh here I can do that.

1451
00:46:58,110 --> 00:46:58,550
Over there.

1452
00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:00,050
Oh okay yeah.

1453
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:02,390
Yeah it's...

1454
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:05,330
Where's like his teammates though?

1455
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:06,410
Why is he taking the Nexus?

1456
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:06,810
What?

1457
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:08,050
Did he fuck up?

1458
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:09,230
Did he use up the Nexus?

1459
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:11,930
Oh he's stupid.

1460
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:12,650
He's special.

1461
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:15,030
It's Singapore service.

1462
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:17,070
Okay.

1463
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:18,450
I'm in front of this.

1464
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:22,350
Alright I literally have a sniper.

1465
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:23,590
So I'm counting on you.

1466
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:24,870
Wait he is.

1467
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:26,010
Yeah he is.

1468
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:26,790
Dude who's on your right?

1469
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:27,630
What the fuck?

1470
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:28,810
I thought you were supposed to help me.

1471
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:31,770
He ran away.

1472
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:33,850
Why is he scared?

1473
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:36,230
Cause...

1474
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:37,710
You're dope.

1475
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:39,630
We should go for the guy to our left.

1476
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:42,150
That one?

1477
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:42,790
Yeah.

1478
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:43,630
I don't know.

1479
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:44,490
I don't see him but yeah.

1480
00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:49,270
Oh my god.

1481
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:50,290
Cracked like two of them.

1482
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:51,030
He's so low.

1483
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:53,310
You got this.

1484
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:54,090
I believe in you.

1485
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:55,450
Literally one...

1486
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:57,550
Oh it's okay.

1487
00:47:57,610 --> 00:47:57,810
It's okay.

1488
00:47:57,890 --> 00:47:58,270
Watch this.

1489
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:00,550
That's why I'm lifelined.

1490
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:04,670
Yo you even got like a...

1491
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:05,450
Field drone.

1492
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:06,550
Someone's behind you.

1493
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:07,690
You're fine.

1494
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:08,010
You're fine.

1495
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:08,270
You're fine.

1496
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:08,570
Oh!

1497
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:10,130
Yeah yeah exactly.

1498
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:11,510
You're fine.

1499
00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:12,170
You're so fine.

1500
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:12,930
Where are you?

1501
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:13,930
Where did you die?

1502
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:15,070
You need to...

1503
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:16,890
No.

1504
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:17,850
I told you.

1505
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:18,470
You're so fine.

1506
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:18,790
Huh?

1507
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:20,230
Oh my god.

1508
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:21,090
I told you.

1509
00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:23,230
Guys we have to go.

1510
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:23,890
Go.

1511
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:26,450
Ow.

1512
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:28,330
I'm leaving by the way.

1513
00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:29,190
The zone is coming.

1514
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:31,950
Hey but I have a package.

1515
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:34,590
I'm so healthy.

1516
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:37,230
I know there's like one more team.

1517
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:38,330
Somewhere here.

1518
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:40,090
Do you have your Q?

1519
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:42,030
Uh no I used it.

1520
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:44,530
But I do have...

1521
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:47,450
A knockdown shield.

1522
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:49,150
Would I need that?

1523
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:53,070
Uh we need a go go.

1524
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:53,990
I'm gonna take the redeploy.

1525
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:55,710
I have a...

1526
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:57,010
Thingy.

1527
00:48:57,010 --> 00:48:57,450
Whatever.

1528
00:48:57,490 --> 00:48:57,970
Oh a redeploy?

1529
00:48:58,190 --> 00:48:58,690
The fly.

1530
00:48:58,850 --> 00:48:59,090
Yeah.

1531
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:00,870
Yeah I'm gonna take that then.

1532
00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:02,090
You guys can take yours.

1533
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:03,350
I'll take this in front of me.

1534
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:05,990
Let's go bang!

1535
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:07,790
Come on!

1536
00:49:08,330 --> 00:49:10,910
It would be so funny if I died from getting shot from this.

1537
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:12,770
It would be so funny.

1538
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:15,470
It would be so fucking funny.

1539
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:16,450
Where are we going?

1540
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:17,390
Straight?

1541
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:19,150
Let's head to zone.

1542
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:21,610
We're literally so far from zone.

1543
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:23,270
Yep.

1544
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:24,810
I'm gonna head to this actually.

1545
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:26,130
And then fly over it.

1546
00:49:27,350 --> 00:49:28,370
Do another jump down?

1547
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:28,950
Yeah.

1548
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:30,950
I think we're fine.

1549
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:31,910
We're so safe.

1550
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:33,810
Like what are you gonna do?

1551
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:34,250
Kill us?

1552
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:35,850
Someone's resing.

1553
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:36,450
Where?

1554
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:37,850
Oh.

1555
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:38,450
Okay.

1556
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:39,050
Then we'll go here.

1557
00:49:40,370 --> 00:49:40,990
Down here.

1558
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:42,310
That's good.

1559
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:43,110
Yeah.

1560
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:44,650
Then we'll shoot them and kill them.

1561
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:46,770
Oh I see them.

1562
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:47,450
They're too far left.

1563
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:47,710
Yeah.

1564
00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:49,810
He's literally right there.

1565
00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:51,130
Okay.

1566
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:51,990
Yeah there's nobody here.

1567
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:52,530
There's nobody here.

1568
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:53,370
I'm gonna go up.

1569
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:57,730
Didn't they just craft a mobile res beacon I'm pretty sure.

1570
00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:00,450
You can craft a mobile res beacon.

1571
00:50:00,830 --> 00:50:01,470
I think you can right?

1572
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:02,550
There's a lot of dead bodies in there.

1573
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:03,070
I think you can right?

1574
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:03,070
There's a lot of dead bodies in there.

1575
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:04,390
That must be where they died.

1576
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:06,050
Oh I see them.

1577
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:07,510
Oh.

1578
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:09,630
Full team.

1579
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:09,990
Full team.

1580
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:10,330
Full team.

1581
00:50:10,350 --> 00:50:10,650
Full team.

1582
00:50:11,330 --> 00:50:11,810
Okay.

1583
00:50:12,290 --> 00:50:13,350
Yeah I'm gonna chill.

1584
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:13,730
I'm chilling.

1585
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:15,930
Whoa!

1586
00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:16,930
Back away!

1587
00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:19,050
I'm using my heal drone.

1588
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:24,460
Someone step on that please.

1589
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:24,980
Come on.

1590
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:28,600
Where the fuck are you doomed?

1591
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:31,460
It's so funny.

1592
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,140
If someone steps in there.

1593
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,700
They are not stepping.

1594
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,720
You know damn well they are not stepping on it.

1595
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:39,080
Oh they will.

1596
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:40,280
Eventually they will.

1597
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:41,980
They are not stepping on it.

1598
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:42,520
Tension.

1599
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,580
They are not stepping on it.

1600
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,040
Eventually they will.

1601
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:47,440
Eventually they will.

1602
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:47,640
Trust me.

1603
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:48,700
Wait they have to leave though.

1604
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:49,700
Yeah they do.

1605
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:50,320
Cause they're not in zone.

1606
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,160
Alright I'm leaving.

1607
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:51,440
We're not in zone.

1608
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:52,620
Yeah I was gonna say.

1609
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:54,420
Tension they didn't step on it.

1610
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,180
I thought you said they would.

1611
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:57,560
Nobody is that blind.

1612
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,320
Don't worry about it.

1613
00:50:58,360 --> 00:50:58,800
I am.

1614
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:01,400
Let me see if I can climb up this.

1615
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:01,740
Nice.

1616
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:02,040
Okay.

1617
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:04,260
What?

1618
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:07,040
Okay I fucked up.

1619
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:07,880
I fucked up.

1620
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:08,800
They might rush now.

1621
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:09,220
What did you do?

1622
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,020
I fucked up.

1623
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,560
I thought they weren't gonna turn around.

1624
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:12,080
What did you do?

1625
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:13,280
I nearly walked them.

1626
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:15,300
Guys I really need a rez.

1627
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,760
They're gonna rush with this.

1628
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:18,480
Guys.

1629
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:19,180
Tension.

1630
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:20,320
You have the mobile.

1631
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:21,940
You have the mobile rez.

1632
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:22,980
You have the gold rez right?

1633
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:24,780
Oh they're here.

1634
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:25,200
They're here.

1635
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:25,580
They're here.

1636
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:27,260
I'm gonna take your.

1637
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:29,460
Okay that nexus is.

1638
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:30,200
You'll be fine.

1639
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:31,520
You'll be fine.

1640
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,000
Taking your nexus.

1641
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:35,060
You got me right?

1642
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:35,660
You got me right?

1643
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:37,040
No no no no.

1644
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:37,880
You got me right?

1645
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:40,240
Bro what the fuck is this nexus?

1646
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:43,190
You got me right?

1647
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:43,830
Take the nexus.

1648
00:51:44,430 --> 00:51:45,410
Take the fucking nexus.

1649
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:46,090
Oh.

1650
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:48,190
You got me right?

1651
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:48,710
Yeah.

1652
00:51:50,290 --> 00:51:50,770
Yeah.

1653
00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:51,250
Alright.

1654
00:51:51,530 --> 00:51:52,010
Yeah.

1655
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:52,610
Let's do this.

1656
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:53,510
There's a craft.

1657
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:54,950
Yeah I do.

1658
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:55,210
Right there.

1659
00:51:55,450 --> 00:51:57,090
And then you craft in the big mod.

1660
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:59,130
Yeah I do.

1661
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:00,190
You got this.

1662
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:01,610
Yeah.

1663
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:03,450
Yeah.

1664
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:03,470
Yeah.

1665
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,390
This is awkward.

1666
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:11,410
Wait they're getting shot at.

1667
00:52:11,850 --> 00:52:13,230
Yeah I told you just craft.

1668
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:14,330
You know and leave.

1669
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:15,730
Where?

1670
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:16,310
Craft.

1671
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:18,010
Dude on your right.

1672
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:18,590
Hello?

1673
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:19,210
What the fuck?

1674
00:52:20,090 --> 00:52:20,570
Dude.

1675
00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:21,310
What the fuck?

1676
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:21,990
What?

1677
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:25,010
Dude.

1678
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:26,530
What is wrong?

1679
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,120
Oh that's right you fucking.

1680
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:35,020
That's right you're.

1681
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:35,760
They're dead.

1682
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:36,080
They're dead.

1683
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,340
This is round three.

1684
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:37,920
They're dead.

1685
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:39,400
They're dead.

1686
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:40,440
You killed us.

1687
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:41,440
Bro.

1688
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,020
I want you to watch them die.

1689
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:45,960
Bro.

1690
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,440
No they died by default.

1691
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:49,300
We won by default.

1692
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:49,720
I can't believe it.

1693
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:50,560
I can't fucking.

1694
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:52,800
You didn't see that.

1695
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,680
Oh that's a cool ass name.

1696
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:56,180
I can't believe it.

1697
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:00,200
We could have saw this.

1698
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,300
I can't believe it.

1699
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:02,540
We won by default.

1700
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:03,440
Don't worry about it.

1701
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,100
Honestly true true true.

1702
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:05,560
They died.

1703
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:07,020
That means we won automatically.

1704
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:08,360
Yeah we won.

1705
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:10,580
Easy.

1706
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,440
You're right.

1707
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,580
It was easily a GG's anyway.

1708
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:20,420
That's crazy.

1709
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:23,860
I can't believe they threw.

1710
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:26,240
They just didn't go to zone.

1711
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:28,100
They could have.

1712
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:28,360
Yeah.

1713
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:30,420
That's all they had to do.

1714
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:35,910
Yeah we won chat.

1715
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:36,950
Yeah we won.

1716
00:53:36,970 --> 00:53:37,490
Don't worry about it.

1717
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:39,050
We won the mental game.

1718
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:40,570
Shit.

1719
00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:43,810
The mental game.

1720
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:45,970
Yeah we won the mental warfare.

1721
00:53:46,610 --> 00:53:48,070
Mentally I am not here.

1722
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:50,030
True.

1723
00:53:52,550 --> 00:53:54,130
Mentally I'm in Tarkov.

1724
00:53:55,010 --> 00:53:56,650
Bro you're still playing as GAM.

1725
00:53:57,050 --> 00:53:57,650
No.

1726
00:53:58,270 --> 00:53:59,970
I haven't touched it in like.

1727
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:03,810
See you fucking bought that 50% shit.

1728
00:54:03,810 --> 00:54:05,470
And then you're fucking playing.

1729
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:05,810
Oh shit.

1730
00:54:05,830 --> 00:54:06,670
I'm letting you.

1731
00:54:07,390 --> 00:54:08,250
I'm letting you.

1732
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:11,510
I'm a wingy.

1733
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:13,510
Alright.

1734
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:14,770
I'm a wingy.

1735
00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:15,450
I have a flat line.

1736
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:19,070
Don't die.

1737
00:54:19,870 --> 00:54:20,930
That's all I can say.

1738
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:22,990
Just don't die.

1739
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:24,250
Oh is that guy gonna leave?

1740
00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:25,570
I might be dead though.

1741
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:27,050
Our guy left.

1742
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:28,930
What the fuck?

1743
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:35,550
Hey I'm missing all my shi- No!

1744
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:36,430
I flashed.

1745
00:54:36,450 --> 00:54:36,650
I flashed.

1746
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:36,650
I flashed.

1747
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:38,530
Oh no.

1748
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:39,610
I got flashed.

1749
00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:40,890
Don't worry I shield you.

1750
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:41,350
I got you.

1751
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:42,650
What are you doing bro?

1752
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:45,230
Oh my god bro.

1753
00:54:45,730 --> 00:54:46,330
Wait.

1754
00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:48,270
Don't die like this.

1755
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:49,770
Ohhhh.

1756
00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:51,710
Okay that was sick.

1757
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:52,630
There's no team.

1758
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:57,150
Okay.

1759
00:54:57,490 --> 00:55:00,030
I expected that from far away.

1760
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:01,290
That was cool.

1761
00:55:01,350 --> 00:55:03,530
I expected that from far far away.

1762
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:05,990
You died to cream de la pussy.

1763
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:10,070
I broke his knees.

1764
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:11,530
I broke his knees.

1765
00:55:11,870 --> 00:55:12,990
Oh my god.

1766
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:14,130
That was cool though.

1767
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:16,030
I expected that so much.

1768
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:17,450
That was that back and forth.

1769
00:55:17,830 --> 00:55:18,890
There's a second team.

1770
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:19,590
There is.

1771
00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:23,870
We landed with like four teams.

1772
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:24,770
Oh my god.

1773
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:26,130
I mean you clutched it.

1774
00:55:26,330 --> 00:55:27,890
You clutched it and then you died.

1775
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:29,370
Yeah well that's a win in my book.

1776
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:30,950
Oh shit.

1777
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:35,370
Okay he must have a shotgun ball.

1778
00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:35,990
There's no way.

1779
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:38,350
That swap was so fucking fast.

1780
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:38,990
Did you see that?

1781
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:41,130
That's...

1782
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:43,970
That was such a fucking fast swap.

1783
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:47,580
Man.

1784
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:51,760
I have been streaming Apex for three days straight.

1785
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:52,220
Have I?

1786
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:54,000
Were you actually streaming Apex?

1787
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:54,380
Really?

1788
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:55,260
I thought you played finals.

1789
00:55:56,700 --> 00:56:00,260
Yeah after finals there's Apex and then Apex and then a break.

1790
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:02,080
And then Apex at night and then Apex.

1791
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:03,140
And then now you Apex.

1792
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:03,920
Yay.

1793
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,560
I mean it shows.

1794
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:08,280
It shows that you're warmed up.

1795
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:09,740
Well...

1796
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:10,780
Probably.

1797
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:12,880
It's mostly stupidity.

1798
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:14,760
Because it's just the boys.

1799
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:17,000
Oh because you guys are playing rank right?

1800
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:18,360
Yeah we were.

1801
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:20,400
Yeah that's why you're gold.

1802
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:22,580
Because someone challenged us.

1803
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:24,700
Well someone challenged my teammate.

1804
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:29,580
That if we reach masters someone's gonna buy him like a scuf controller or something like that.

1805
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:29,900
I don't know.

1806
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:30,540
But yeah.

1807
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:31,820
What the fuck?

1808
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:32,900
Why does he want a controller?

1809
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:34,980
Because he's a controller player.

1810
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,040
I don't know.

1811
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:38,360
Oh wait no tell him to get him a battle beaver.

1812
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:40,760
What's that?

1813
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:44,680
That's like the controller that everybody uses.

1814
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:45,680
Like all the pros uses.

1815
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,200
For real?

1816
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:47,720
Yeah.

1817
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:51,300
I know because I bought one and I never used it.

1818
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:54,480
That's...

1819
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:55,420
Yeah.

1820
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,760
I know we just met but I could tell you'd do that.

1821
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:00,280
Yeah.

1822
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:02,640
You knew that.

1823
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:06,860
Wait so like he needs to be masters to get that?

1824
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:07,100
Yeah.

1825
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,000
But that's so fucking easy.

1826
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:10,720
I know right?

1827
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:11,200
Yeah.

1828
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:12,820
Wait what rank is he now?

1829
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:15,460
Gold 1 I guess.

1830
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:17,260
Yeah but how long...

1831
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:21,060
How many days left till rank is over?

1832
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:23,000
I'm not sure actually.

1833
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:24,480
I'm pretty sure it's not that...

1834
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,240
Like there's still a long time right?

1835
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:26,840
Rank just started.

1836
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:28,760
Guys how many more days till rank is over?

1837
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:31,380
Whoa whoa whoa I got freaked out.

1838
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:32,420
I'm here I'm coming over.

1839
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:33,900
JK I'm looting.

1840
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:35,380
I'm looting right now.

1841
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:37,280
You guys are fine right?

1842
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,940
He has 26 days bro that's so easy.

1843
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:42,540
Yeah there's a lot.

1844
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:44,560
Yeah you can literally get that in like...

1845
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,220
Like 2 weeks.

1846
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:47,820
We got this.

1847
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:51,380
Like literally 2 weeks you can get masters.

1848
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:52,720
That's so fucking easy.

1849
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:54,620
No no no no no.

1850
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:56,720
Wait what?

1851
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:58,140
You guys need HP?

1852
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,900
I can't get on the goddamn train.

1853
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:02,240
What the fuck are you doing?

1854
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:02,760
For some reason.

1855
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:04,680
Okay there's a team on the other side.

1856
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,440
Yeah that's why I wanted to go there.

1857
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:08,840
I don't see them though.

1858
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,260
But I know they landed there.

1859
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:12,420
Where are they?

1860
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:16,240
Where the fuck are they?

1861
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:18,540
They're all over there.

1862
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:19,420
Pigeon look.

1863
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:20,780
Look with your eyes.

1864
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:22,080
Tell me where they are.

1865
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,180
Look with your eyes.

1866
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:27,320
Oh true you're Asian.

1867
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:28,980
So am I.

1868
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:31,500
We are all.

1869
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:32,340
So am I.

1870
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,660
Alright don't worry I'm coming over.

1871
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:38,980
I'm coming over.

1872
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:39,540
I'm coming over.

1873
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:42,840
I wanna go through that too.

1874
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:44,860
Wait where are they?

1875
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:46,760
What the fuck?

1876
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:49,660
I didn't finish you on this guy.

1877
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:50,900
I didn't finish you on this guy.

1878
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:51,760
Accidentally.

1879
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:53,380
Where are you?

1880
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:56,240
Over there below.

1881
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:58,380
Flesh?

1882
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:59,040
JK?

1883
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:01,800
What?

1884
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:03,960
What?

1885
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:05,240
What?

1886
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:08,080
I'm being shot by another squad.

1887
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:12,660
Behind us?

1888
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:13,620
Okay.

1889
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:15,760
There's a wingman here.

1890
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:16,140
You want it?

1891
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:17,320
Hold on.

1892
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:20,280
I'll take it.

1893
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:21,740
Oh that's insane.

1894
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:22,400
You needed the...

1895
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:24,360
I don't think they're pushing.

1896
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:26,060
There's no way they're pushing.

1897
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:27,540
They're too scared.

1898
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:31,880
I don't think I'll switch the loom in just a second.

1899
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:34,880
Wait I don't see them?

1900
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:37,280
I don't see them.

1901
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:40,280
Yeah let's just head over.

1902
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:41,240
Yeah.

1903
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:42,460
Alright.

1904
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:45,220
Yeah of course.

1905
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:45,860
Are you scared?

1906
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:47,060
No.

1907
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:48,220
Yeah don't be a little bitch.

1908
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,140
When did you become a little bitch?

1909
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:51,440
Yeah.

1910
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:54,620
Yeah you're not a little... Tell the world you're not a little bitch.

1911
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:58,840
Okay he's a little bitch.

1912
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:00,900
No I'm too tired.

1913
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:04,100
I've been awake since 2 man.

1914
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:06,580
What the fuck?

1915
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:08,420
What the fuck?

1916
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:09,660
You're like literally...

1917
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:10,860
He's super low.

1918
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:11,920
Oh yeah he's dead.

1919
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:14,920
Nice he's dead too.

1920
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:18,040
Wait where did his teammate go?

1921
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:19,280
Did he run?

1922
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:20,840
You got this.

1923
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:23,280
You got this.

1924
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:24,860
I'm thirsting.

1925
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:26,460
I'm watching you.

1926
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:28,000
Yeah see?

1927
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:29,800
You almost fucking died.

1928
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:31,160
Here's a kill drone.

1929
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:33,840
That's a little embarrassing.

1930
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,080
Yeah hey I punched him like a man.

1931
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:39,180
I showed myself I am no bitch.

1932
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:40,420
Yeah didn't you miss?

1933
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:41,840
No I didn't.

1934
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:42,560
Oh you didn't?

1935
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:43,240
Oh I thought you missed.

1936
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:44,120
That's why you punched him.

1937
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:47,160
Well I ran out of ammo.

1938
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:51,780
I'm gonna go get some more ammo.

1939
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:51,820
I'm gonna go get some more ammo.

1940
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:52,880
Talk to grandpa that way.

1941
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:56,460
Grandpa is like a hardened war veteran.

1942
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:58,940
He can take it.

1943
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:02,560
He can take it.

1944
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:03,400
He can take it.

1945
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:04,560
He's used to it.

1946
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:07,260
Yes yes.

1947
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:09,420
The worst was my wife.

1948
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:11,380
My ex-wife.

1949
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:13,460
She uh...

1950
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:15,980
I thought you were a level 100 wizard.

1951
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:17,880
I thought you were a level 100 wizard.

1952
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:22,000
She divorced me as soon as the same day as we got married.

1953
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:26,220
Oh cause you save it for marriage.

1954
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:31,560
Is that what you're trying to plot?

1955
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:33,840
Oh hey golden triple take.

1956
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:36,100
Waaaaaah it's gone.

1957
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:40,340
Hey hey hey stop shooting me.

1958
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:40,740
Stop shooting me.

1959
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:42,920
I'm heading over.

1960
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,220
Wait they're white armor.

1961
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:46,760
For real?

1962
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:47,220
Yeah.

1963
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:48,020
Why are you saying that?

1964
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:48,380
I'm scared.

1965
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:49,120
They're literally...

1966
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:49,300
Why?

1967
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:52,520
They're white armor.

1968
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:55,080
That's some break.

1969
01:01:58,920 --> 01:01:59,460
Punch him.

1970
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:01,100
Yeah.

1971
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:01,540
Babies.

1972
01:02:01,540 --> 01:02:02,300
They're actual babies.

1973
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:07,600
Is he just by himself or what?

1974
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:08,200
I don't fucking know.

1975
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:09,160
I'm fucking stealing his shit.

1976
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:09,700
What?

1977
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:13,340
No he was...

1978
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:14,200
There was a bloodhound.

1979
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:15,160
I think the bloodhound ran.

1980
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:16,960
Why?

1981
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:18,000
I don't know.

1982
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:18,900
They're white armor.

1983
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:19,860
What do you think why?

1984
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,840
They shot me and they see purple.

1985
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:24,480
Oh there they are.

1986
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:25,620
Oh my god.

1987
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,420
Wait this guy is actually a baby.

1988
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:30,140
He's right here.

1989
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:30,880
He's flesh.

1990
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,120
You can literally kill him.

1991
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:35,940
Well this guy is an actual child.

1992
01:02:40,110 --> 01:02:41,470
Did you kill him?

1993
01:02:42,830 --> 01:02:44,130
So fucked up.

1994
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:46,630
You actually killed a child.

1995
01:02:46,810 --> 01:02:47,470
In game.

1996
01:02:49,010 --> 01:02:50,110
My specialty.

1997
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:55,010
Wait your specialty?

1998
01:02:55,610 --> 01:02:57,290
Wait how many children?

1999
01:02:59,510 --> 01:03:00,170
Wait.

2000
01:03:00,230 --> 01:03:01,190
More than my fingers.

2001
01:03:04,730 --> 01:03:05,390
Alright.

2002
01:03:05,530 --> 01:03:05,990
Oh man.

2003
01:03:06,130 --> 01:03:07,310
Seven more teams.

2004
01:03:09,130 --> 01:03:12,070
Alright what are your plans for streams?

2005
01:03:12,290 --> 01:03:13,190
When you debut?

2006
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:14,650
Benjen.

2007
01:03:15,370 --> 01:03:16,570
What plan are you doing?

2008
01:03:16,770 --> 01:03:16,970
I honestly.

2009
01:03:16,970 --> 01:03:17,450
I'm not sure.

2010
01:03:17,470 --> 01:03:18,170
I have no clue.

2011
01:03:18,310 --> 01:03:21,230
I'm only here to fuck around and find out.

2012
01:03:21,290 --> 01:03:22,890
But he has one to see him stream.

2013
01:03:23,890 --> 01:03:24,370
Guys.

2014
01:03:24,810 --> 01:03:26,590
They want to see me naked.

2015
01:03:26,650 --> 01:03:27,870
Wait is that true?

2016
01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:29,010
Yeah.

2017
01:03:29,550 --> 01:03:31,150
Guys you can't see him naked.

2018
01:03:31,170 --> 01:03:32,130
You gotta marry him first.

2019
01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:33,130
What?

2020
01:03:36,350 --> 01:03:36,850
That's why.

2021
01:03:37,050 --> 01:03:37,890
That's one big super chat.

2022
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:42,350
Chat you can't see him naked guys.

2023
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:45,250
Wait will you marry all of your chat then?

2024
01:03:46,150 --> 01:03:46,630
What?

2025
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:49,170
If they want to see you naked.

2026
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:50,550
Huh?

2027
01:03:51,070 --> 01:03:52,270
They want to see him naked.

2028
01:03:53,550 --> 01:03:54,470
But I'm shy.

2029
01:03:55,530 --> 01:03:56,130
Well.

2030
01:03:57,010 --> 01:03:58,530
That's why you got divorced.

2031
01:03:58,530 --> 01:03:59,550
That's why you got divorced.

2032
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:08,290
Oh my god.

2033
01:04:10,590 --> 01:04:11,790
Oh man.

2034
01:04:15,170 --> 01:04:17,390
I got divorced one day.

2035
01:04:17,510 --> 01:04:18,310
Poor guy.

2036
01:04:20,710 --> 01:04:21,350
Damn.

2037
01:04:22,490 --> 01:04:23,630
It's okay man.

2038
01:04:23,910 --> 01:04:24,670
It's okay bro.

2039
01:04:27,550 --> 01:04:28,570
Shut up.

2040
01:04:28,710 --> 01:04:30,150
I don't want to hear that from you.

2041
01:04:31,270 --> 01:04:32,950
Bro it's okay bro.

2042
01:04:33,230 --> 01:04:35,610
Everything will be okay bro.

2043
01:04:36,470 --> 01:04:37,690
I ain't hearing that.

2044
01:04:39,230 --> 01:04:40,510
One day it's okay.

2045
01:04:40,570 --> 01:04:41,770
Being level 100 is okay.

2046
01:04:41,770 --> 01:04:42,390
I'm a champion and one wizard.

2047
01:04:42,550 --> 01:04:43,670
It's also cool.

2048
01:04:43,970 --> 01:04:46,250
Oh there's enemies in front of me too.

2049
01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:47,430
Don't care about that guy.

2050
01:04:48,330 --> 01:04:49,630
Yeah don't care about him.

2051
01:04:49,630 --> 01:04:51,150
But our teammate is a youtuber.

2052
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:52,130
Don't care.

2053
01:04:52,190 --> 01:04:52,910
Don't care about him.

2054
01:04:53,130 --> 01:04:53,970
We can craft him.

2055
01:04:53,970 --> 01:04:54,430
He's a youtuber.

2056
01:04:54,890 --> 01:04:55,850
He's from youtube.

2057
01:04:56,190 --> 01:04:56,490
It's fine.

2058
01:04:56,670 --> 01:04:57,250
We don't care.

2059
01:04:57,410 --> 01:04:58,450
We're gonna teach him a lesson.

2060
01:05:00,490 --> 01:05:02,730
We're gonna teach him a lesson.

2061
01:05:02,730 --> 01:05:03,350
I can...

2062
01:05:05,490 --> 01:05:07,110
There was a res in front of me.

2063
01:05:07,110 --> 01:05:07,570
Should I just make him a nexus?

2064
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:09,010
Should I make him a nexus?

2065
01:05:09,010 --> 01:05:10,050
No what the fuck.

2066
01:05:10,110 --> 01:05:11,010
He's gotta learn.

2067
01:05:11,710 --> 01:05:12,850
He'll never learn.

2068
01:05:13,090 --> 01:05:16,110
We just rotated the whole line.

2069
01:05:16,130 --> 01:05:17,230
Yeah but we saw a res.

2070
01:05:18,650 --> 01:05:19,130
It's okay.

2071
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:21,970
We saw a res so like it was worth it.

2072
01:05:22,010 --> 01:05:22,830
And also we're going to zone.

2073
01:05:23,490 --> 01:05:25,230
We're just trying to find people.

2074
01:05:26,430 --> 01:05:26,910
Okay.

2075
01:05:28,450 --> 01:05:30,170
Alright I'm climbing up.

2076
01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:32,810
Stop bullying small content creators.

2077
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:34,090
Attention.

2078
01:05:35,790 --> 01:05:36,350
Attention.

2079
01:05:37,050 --> 01:05:38,390
I'm a small content creator.

2080
01:05:38,730 --> 01:05:39,850
No I'm not gonna say that.

2081
01:05:40,110 --> 01:05:41,170
Of course I know.

2082
01:05:43,150 --> 01:05:43,710
Yeah.

2083
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:45,110
I'm sure you know that.

2084
01:05:45,610 --> 01:05:48,050
But like I'm here to give you courage.

2085
01:05:48,410 --> 01:05:49,630
I'm not bullying you right?

2086
01:05:50,190 --> 01:05:51,610
I'm inspiring you.

2087
01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:54,050
I'm inspiring you right now.

2088
01:05:54,270 --> 01:05:55,270
Oh my god.

2089
01:05:55,310 --> 01:05:56,690
What is this laugh?

2090
01:05:56,750 --> 01:05:57,330
Are you okay?

2091
01:05:57,670 --> 01:05:58,430
No I'm not.

2092
01:05:58,450 --> 01:05:59,150
I'm not okay.

2093
01:05:59,670 --> 01:06:03,370
Bro I had like the most insane lag ever.

2094
01:06:03,850 --> 01:06:04,690
Bro I had like the most insane lag ever.

2095
01:06:04,690 --> 01:06:06,030
That was actually crazy.

2096
01:06:06,290 --> 01:06:07,490
That lag was insane.

2097
01:06:09,730 --> 01:06:10,950
Where did it go?

2098
01:06:12,090 --> 01:06:13,310
Did it stop peaking?

2099
01:06:15,030 --> 01:06:15,950
Wait where?

2100
01:06:16,810 --> 01:06:18,610
I'm gonna take my package here.

2101
01:06:23,130 --> 01:06:24,770
Oh my god.

2102
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:26,870
That lag was actually crazy.

2103
01:06:27,470 --> 01:06:28,550
I can't.

2104
01:06:28,550 --> 01:06:29,690
I can't climb it.

2105
01:06:29,770 --> 01:06:30,210
Oh my god.

2106
01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:31,070
Poor guys.

2107
01:06:31,650 --> 01:06:34,210
Poor guys like what the fuck is going on?

2108
01:06:34,350 --> 01:06:35,530
This guy lagged.

2109
01:06:37,350 --> 01:06:38,110
Oh my god.

2110
01:06:38,130 --> 01:06:39,470
We have 500 ping.

2111
01:06:39,510 --> 01:06:40,370
That's actually crazy.

2112
01:06:41,270 --> 01:06:41,750
Wait.

2113
01:06:41,870 --> 01:06:43,930
What I do is actually insane.

2114
01:06:44,490 --> 01:06:44,970
Okay.

2115
01:06:45,770 --> 01:06:48,130
I did something to that poor lifeline.

2116
01:06:49,510 --> 01:06:50,250
And like.

2117
01:06:50,350 --> 01:06:51,270
I feel bad.

2118
01:06:51,930 --> 01:06:53,350
What I did to him.

2119
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:58,620
Oh my god.

2120
01:06:58,620 --> 01:07:00,600
I hit these but like it doesn't register.

2121
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:03,920
I'm gonna go to the right.

2122
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:07,120
I'm gonna go to the right.

2123
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:07,580
Our guard is pushing.

2124
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:09,680
Oh he's fucking crazy then.

2125
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:11,520
You're crazy.

2126
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:13,060
I mean there's two teams.

2127
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:14,120
Yeah still.

2128
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:17,160
I'm gonna heal.

2129
01:07:21,140 --> 01:07:22,040
He's on the roof.

2130
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:23,960
What someone's on the roof?

2131
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:28,060
Don't worry my shots are gonna hit like three seconds later.

2132
01:07:28,620 --> 01:07:29,380
Someone lagged.

2133
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,580
That no ray.

2134
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:33,840
How am I at 500 ping?

2135
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:36,440
This is the worst gun to have.

2136
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:37,420
To be lagging with.

2137
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:42,120
Wait there's people behind us.

2138
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:46,180
I'm heading over here.

2139
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:51,260
I'm gonna head to my guy.

2140
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:56,400
Okay I stopped lagging there at least.

2141
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:57,100
I'm gonna fucking.

2142
01:07:57,380 --> 01:07:58,380
You think I won't?

2143
01:07:58,620 --> 01:07:59,480
I have so much ammo.

2144
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:02,820
No please.

2145
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:04,220
Please Dokie.

2146
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:05,240
Don't do this to me.

2147
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:06,740
No.

2148
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:09,020
It'll be fine right?

2149
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:11,440
Yeah see I knew it.

2150
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:14,000
Woah.

2151
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:15,340
We gotta go to zone though.

2152
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:18,200
I'm heading over to zone.

2153
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:20,580
Sure.

2154
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:21,940
Right below.

2155
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:23,460
Oh in front of us.

2156
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:24,920
They're so far though.

2157
01:08:26,860 --> 01:08:27,460
They are.

2158
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:28,280
What do we do?

2159
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:30,900
I broke their thing so now they're scared.

2160
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:32,300
We're gonna head to zone.

2161
01:08:32,540 --> 01:08:33,280
Someone's resing?

2162
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:35,840
Okay I'm gonna head to the far right.

2163
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:36,800
I'm gonna head to the tunnels.

2164
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:39,980
Yeah they're just gonna camp us out.

2165
01:08:40,660 --> 01:08:41,600
Let's head to the tunnels.

2166
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:42,620
It's not worth it.

2167
01:08:44,180 --> 01:08:46,220
The zone is closing anyway so.

2168
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:47,280
Wait can we make it?

2169
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:50,000
Wait I don't even know if we can make it to the tunnels.

2170
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:51,540
Can we?

2171
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:52,200
No we can't.

2172
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:53,140
We actually can't.

2173
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:54,320
We have to go like.

2174
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:56,180
Do we have to?

2175
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:57,740
I can't make that.

2176
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:00,180
We have to go here.

2177
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:02,240
I'm gonna go.

2178
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:03,540
I'm just gonna go here then.

2179
01:09:03,820 --> 01:09:04,700
Are guys fighting?

2180
01:09:04,980 --> 01:09:05,600
Wait what?

2181
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:09,160
I got this for you guys.

2182
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:11,500
Wait we have your Q.

2183
01:09:13,180 --> 01:09:13,660
Yeah.

2184
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:18,180
Yeah we have your Q to rotate.

2185
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:24,120
Alright.

2186
01:09:25,780 --> 01:09:26,420
Climb up.

2187
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:30,000
Is there a rez out here?

2188
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:35,900
Climb up.

2189
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:37,640
I'm not climbing up anymore.

2190
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:40,020
I'm taking your portal.

2191
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:42,200
Oh my god.

2192
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:42,480
What?

2193
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:45,120
Oh my god.

2194
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:46,600
Oh my god.

2195
01:09:46,660 --> 01:09:47,740
They're blasting me.

2196
01:09:48,860 --> 01:09:49,560
What the fuck?

2197
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,520
We can't camp that place.

2198
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:52,520
Oh shit.

2199
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:55,640
Jesus Christ.

2200
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:56,960
What happened?

2201
01:09:58,260 --> 01:09:59,600
I have no clue.

2202
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:00,800
What happened to you guys?

2203
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:03,120
You died so fast.

2204
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:04,000
I don't know.

2205
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:05,120
That was bad.

2206
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:07,800
All eyes were on me.

2207
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:12,460
I literally went up the portal and everything was just gone.

2208
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:21,380
I thought I was behind a pole and I was safe.

2209
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:22,400
Yeah.

2210
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:25,300
You were just gone.

2211
01:10:25,740 --> 01:10:26,260
Yeah.

2212
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:29,800
Man.

2213
01:10:30,220 --> 01:10:32,480
You like literally got deleted so fast.

2214
01:10:32,620 --> 01:10:33,100
I'm not gonna lie.

2215
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:35,900
That's Apex.

2216
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:41,460
That's Apex.

2217
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:41,880
Oh.

2218
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:42,920
It's okay.

2219
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:43,620
It's alright.

2220
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:44,860
We're gonna win this next one.

2221
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:45,620
Cause we're better.

2222
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:46,480
Oh hey.

2223
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:47,400
We all did pretty well.

2224
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:49,680
Hey that YouTuber guy did pretty good.

2225
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:51,680
He was not dead weight.

2226
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:53,100
He's alright.

2227
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:56,140
Guys he was not dead weight.

2228
01:10:56,180 --> 01:10:56,800
He did it.

2229
01:10:57,100 --> 01:10:59,360
We got a random that actually did stuff.

2230
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:02,220
We got a random that actually did stuff.

2231
01:11:02,220 --> 01:11:02,760
Good for him.

2232
01:11:05,260 --> 01:11:06,160
Good for him.

2233
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:06,540
Good on him.

2234
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:07,720
Good for him.

2235
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:09,000
Yay.

2236
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:11,560
Why's the QN taking so long?

2237
01:11:12,890 --> 01:11:13,220
Yay.

2238
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:18,880
Apparently like I tweeted out that like I joined a cool religion.

2239
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:25,860
Apparently, Klu In like I guess like Brazilian Is ass.

2240
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:29,980
So I technically tweeted out I joined an ass religion today.

2241
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:36,260
All my like Brazilian dragoons are really confused.

2242
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:40,640
I never knew you were an ass person.

2243
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:48,520
I was like wondering why there's so much Brazilian comments.

2244
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:55,020
Oh shit it's KingShy.

2245
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:55,560
Fuck!

2246
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:56,880
Why did I play Alter?

2247
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:58,100
Why did I go Alter?

2248
01:11:58,100 --> 01:11:59,680
Ah damn.

2249
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:02,440
Yeah so apparently people were like...

2250
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:02,900
Not judging.

2251
01:12:03,380 --> 01:12:06,400
Why are you saying ass?

2252
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:13,960
So how'd you join the ass cult?

2253
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:18,060
And like where do I sign up?

2254
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:19,760
Did you just tear it open?

2255
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:22,320
Did you tear it open or what?

2256
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:27,320
Oh my god.

2257
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:28,480
Whoops.

2258
01:12:29,860 --> 01:12:30,460
Whoops.

2259
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:32,560
I mean it works still.

2260
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:33,560
It works still.

2261
01:12:34,700 --> 01:12:36,020
Yeah it's Portuguese.

2262
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:36,700
Yeah.

2263
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:38,560
Apparently...

2264
01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:42,440
I don't even know how it's pronounced.

2265
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:46,240
But like someone in my comments, the replies were like...

2266
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:48,740
Ooh the Brazilian dragoons are coming.

2267
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:49,720
And I got so confused.

2268
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:51,740
I got so fucking confused.

2269
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:52,320
I was like why?

2270
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:54,700
It's silent and deadly religion.

2271
01:12:55,220 --> 01:12:56,920
And then I saw like...

2272
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:59,260
I guess I saw Portuguese in my chat.

2273
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:00,240
Like in my replies.

2274
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:03,340
And I was like why is there so much Portuguese right now?

2275
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:04,600
Going on in my replies.

2276
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:08,660
Well now you know.

2277
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:09,640
What's going on?

2278
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:12,740
Bro I miss.

2279
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:15,380
Oh wait there is...

2280
01:13:15,380 --> 01:13:16,280
Is there team on us?

2281
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:17,820
Not really.

2282
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:21,840
I'm not sure.

2283
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:22,920
There shouldn't be.

2284
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:24,580
Doki come to Brazil.

2285
01:13:24,580 --> 01:13:27,400
Then have a Brazilian convention invite me guys.

2286
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:30,120
I'm down.

2287
01:13:30,540 --> 01:13:32,100
I wanna go to Brazil.

2288
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:33,520
Like virtually.

2289
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:35,280
You're going to Brazil.

2290
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:35,860
Virtually.

2291
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:40,740
Tell your local...

2292
01:13:40,740 --> 01:13:41,300
Not local.

2293
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:42,520
Tell your conventions.

2294
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:43,280
Your big...

2295
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:45,500
Anime conventions to invite me.

2296
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:46,500
To Brazil.

2297
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:48,680
I'll come to Brazil.

2298
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:50,880
Bro.

2299
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:57,220
I don't know.

2300
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:57,600
I don't know.

2301
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:57,860
I don't know when.

2302
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:01,120
I don't know.

2303
01:14:01,340 --> 01:14:02,640
I don't know.

2304
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:02,760
I don't know when.

2305
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:04,960
You're the one that has the connections.

2306
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:06,480
Hey man.

2307
01:14:06,540 --> 01:14:07,140
Hey man.

2308
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:08,440
I link...

2309
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:09,740
I try linking you up.

2310
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:11,160
That's all I did.

2311
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:11,500
Yo.

2312
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:12,020
Okay look.

2313
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:12,420
Look.

2314
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:13,060
They just...

2315
01:14:13,060 --> 01:14:13,740
Okay to be fair.

2316
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:14,320
That's on me.

2317
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:16,700
Cause like I didn't reply back to...

2318
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:17,860
Like the email.

2319
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:19,180
No they didn't send me...

2320
01:14:19,180 --> 01:14:20,840
They didn't send me the new email.

2321
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:23,160
I was waiting for the new email.

2322
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:24,620
But it wasn't sent.

2323
01:14:25,780 --> 01:14:27,900
That's not fully on me.

2324
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:31,900
Guys, guys, guys.

2325
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:32,580
I need help.

2326
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:33,920
Guys, guys, here.

2327
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:35,300
I got distracted by Brazil.

2328
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:39,720
I got distracted.

2329
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,180
I blame Tengen.

2330
01:14:42,140 --> 01:14:43,440
I blame Tengen.

2331
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:44,700
You distracted me.

2332
01:14:44,860 --> 01:14:45,880
Yeah, that's why.

2333
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:46,880
Now you're dead.

2334
01:14:47,180 --> 01:14:49,380
Now you're fucking dead.

2335
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:51,380
We got the caustic in the team.

2336
01:14:52,220 --> 01:14:53,860
He got down.

2337
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:59,220
Wait, wait, he can do this.

2338
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:00,240
He's better.

2339
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:00,600
He can.

2340
01:15:00,860 --> 01:15:00,960
He can.

2341
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:02,400
He's so much better.

2342
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:03,520
Someone's rezzing.

2343
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:06,040
Yeah, it's the guy that our guy fucking...

2344
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:07,060
Okay, he's not that better.

2345
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:08,600
Never mind.

2346
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:09,740
He's not that much better.

2347
01:15:12,860 --> 01:15:17,180
Look, maybe I'll be there at an Indonesian convention.

2348
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:18,500
Maybe.

2349
01:15:19,380 --> 01:15:20,520
I just need, you know...

2350
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:23,680
Tengen, tell them to email me.

2351
01:15:25,580 --> 01:15:26,160
On it.

2352
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:26,740
Yeah.

2353
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:29,640
I told you to tell them to email me.

2354
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:31,740
And you just like replied back to the old email.

2355
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:34,900
I was just like, yeah, but like it's the old email.

2356
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:35,560
I need to...

2357
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:36,620
It doesn't matter.

2358
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:37,800
Yes, it does.

2359
01:15:37,940 --> 01:15:39,440
Because it's the old one.

2360
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:41,240
All right, all right, all right.

2361
01:15:41,260 --> 01:15:42,500
Because that date was gone.

2362
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:45,280
I'll try to set it up.

2363
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:45,620
Okay.

2364
01:15:45,980 --> 01:15:46,020
Yeah.

2365
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:48,780
You have a lot of fans in Indonesia.

2366
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:49,560
Yeah.

2367
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,540
Any Indo bros?

2368
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:54,080
Indo bros, rise up.

2369
01:15:55,220 --> 01:15:55,780
Rise up.

2370
01:15:55,780 --> 01:15:56,260
There's a lot, bro.

2371
01:15:56,820 --> 01:15:57,720
I'm one of them.

2372
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:58,860
Oh shit, you're right.

2373
01:15:58,900 --> 01:15:59,920
Yeah, the one that's...

2374
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:01,540
Yeah, yeah, he's membered now, right?

2375
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:02,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2376
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:03,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2377
01:16:05,780 --> 01:16:07,200
Yeah, he's my biggest fan.

2378
01:16:07,420 --> 01:16:08,960
Oh yeah, that's our story, right?

2379
01:16:09,020 --> 01:16:09,160
Yeah.

2380
01:16:09,260 --> 01:16:11,320
You were like the biggest Doki fan.

2381
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:14,760
And then we bumped into each other.

2382
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:16,140
I forgot our story almost.

2383
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:23,320
We bumped into each other in Apex and he was fangirling me hard.

2384
01:16:23,660 --> 01:16:26,080
And he was like, oh my God, you're the real Doki Bird.

2385
01:16:26,340 --> 01:16:28,100
I've been following you for like...

2386
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:29,860
Oh my God, is that Doki Bird?

2387
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:32,180
Yeah, that's what he said in voice chat.

2388
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:32,640
Yeah, that's what I said.

2389
01:16:32,740 --> 01:16:33,600
And then I blocked him.

2390
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:35,980
Yeah, pretty much what happened.

2391
01:16:36,180 --> 01:16:38,580
Yeah, and then I blocked him because I was like, ugh.

2392
01:16:40,540 --> 01:16:40,980
Indeed.

2393
01:16:41,900 --> 01:16:43,560
I was like, oh my God.

2394
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:45,520
I'm fucked.

2395
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:46,020
So real.

2396
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:46,760
I'm fucked.

2397
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:49,080
They landed there?

2398
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:49,460
Really?

2399
01:16:49,540 --> 01:16:50,060
I don't have a gun.

2400
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:51,620
You don't have a gun.

2401
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:52,360
I have one gun.

2402
01:16:53,060 --> 01:16:57,740
You know, like they made a thing where you loot a pill, they automatically give you a gun when you first land.

2403
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:00,140
Shit.

2404
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:01,080
Are they following us?

2405
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:02,840
Oh fuck, no, I don't have a gun.

2406
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:07,040
Hey, oh my God.

2407
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:09,420
Hey, oh my God.

2408
01:17:10,660 --> 01:17:12,020
Oh, I'm going to rotate.

2409
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:13,800
If you guys die, it's on you.

2410
01:17:14,020 --> 01:17:15,480
Oh, there's guns here.

2411
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:18,040
I'm fine.

2412
01:17:21,250 --> 01:17:22,390
They are scared now.

2413
01:17:22,470 --> 01:17:22,830
They're scared.

2414
01:17:23,190 --> 01:17:25,490
I literally can barely see them, but they're scared.

2415
01:17:27,050 --> 01:17:29,490
I'm going to put this.

2416
01:17:32,510 --> 01:17:32,990
Yeah.

2417
01:17:35,450 --> 01:17:35,930
Okay.

2418
01:17:36,730 --> 01:17:38,110
What a wingman?

2419
01:17:38,910 --> 01:17:40,510
I found a turbocharger.

2420
01:17:41,390 --> 01:17:41,870
Okay.

2421
01:17:43,350 --> 01:17:44,310
I have...

2422
01:17:44,310 --> 01:17:44,970
Oh, wait, they're fighting.

2423
01:17:45,170 --> 01:17:46,490
The worst you could say was no.

2424
01:17:46,630 --> 01:17:47,110
No, no, no, no.

2425
01:17:47,110 --> 01:17:48,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2426
01:17:49,030 --> 01:17:50,230
There's worse...

2427
01:17:51,050 --> 01:17:54,150
Someone said like the worst thing she could say is no.

2428
01:17:55,030 --> 01:17:55,630
Nah.

2429
01:17:57,230 --> 01:17:58,550
There's more than that.

2430
01:17:58,670 --> 01:17:58,890
Oh yeah?

2431
01:17:59,050 --> 01:17:59,710
You have experience?

2432
01:18:00,010 --> 01:18:00,150
What?

2433
01:18:01,330 --> 01:18:03,430
I'd rather not talk about it.

2434
01:18:03,450 --> 01:18:03,990
Nah.

2435
01:18:05,830 --> 01:18:06,430
Nah.

2436
01:18:07,010 --> 01:18:08,370
Oh no, trauma.

2437
01:18:10,470 --> 01:18:11,070
Yep.

2438
01:18:11,970 --> 01:18:13,110
Wanna go from behind?

2439
01:18:13,110 --> 01:18:13,650
We brought complex.

2440
01:18:13,970 --> 01:18:15,030
I'm from below.

2441
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:16,850
I need help.

2442
01:18:17,390 --> 01:18:17,970
Complex?

2443
01:18:18,150 --> 01:18:19,770
I'm also fighting someone.

2444
01:18:21,770 --> 01:18:22,670
Oh crap.

2445
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:24,530
Got one.

2446
01:18:25,070 --> 01:18:26,010
Oh god!

2447
01:18:26,790 --> 01:18:27,190
Wait,

2448
01:18:30,890 --> 01:18:31,170
wait, wait.

2449
01:18:31,310 --> 01:18:31,850
I need to swap.

2450
01:18:31,990 --> 01:18:32,230
No!

2451
01:18:34,870 --> 01:18:36,470
I gotta kill someone.

2452
01:18:36,610 --> 01:18:37,610
I'm fighting my demons.

2453
01:18:37,810 --> 01:18:39,010
Oh my god!

2454
01:18:39,130 --> 01:18:41,470
I'm fighting your demons right now!

2455
01:18:41,810 --> 01:18:42,570
He's up there.

2456
01:18:42,610 --> 01:18:43,030
He's up top.

2457
01:18:43,090 --> 01:18:44,670
He's up top still?

2458
01:18:44,870 --> 01:18:45,450
Why?

2459
01:18:46,710 --> 01:18:47,610
I don't fucking know.

2460
01:18:50,170 --> 01:18:50,850
Sick one.

2461
01:18:50,950 --> 01:18:51,890
Oh he hates you.

2462
01:18:51,990 --> 01:18:53,490
He's fucking BMing you.

2463
01:18:53,590 --> 01:18:54,610
Now you have to win.

2464
01:18:55,050 --> 01:18:56,670
So you can shit talk him after.

2465
01:18:59,070 --> 01:19:00,150
Oh no way.

2466
01:19:00,150 --> 01:19:01,370
You proved this point!

2467
01:19:02,090 --> 01:19:02,570
No way.

2468
01:19:02,570 --> 01:19:02,950
You proved it.

2469
01:19:03,930 --> 01:19:04,410
Yeah.

2470
01:19:04,610 --> 01:19:05,750
God damn.

2471
01:19:06,050 --> 01:19:06,530
Alt.

2472
01:19:10,610 --> 01:19:11,570
No way.

2473
01:19:12,010 --> 01:19:12,270
No way.

2474
01:19:13,930 --> 01:19:14,410
Damn.

2475
01:19:14,650 --> 01:19:15,370
You got called out.

2476
01:19:16,610 --> 01:19:17,090
Yeah.

2477
01:19:17,290 --> 01:19:18,850
You got fucking called out bro.

2478
01:19:20,170 --> 01:19:21,250
It doesn't matter.

2479
01:19:21,770 --> 01:19:23,230
Lots of trash in the sheet.

2480
01:19:26,850 --> 01:19:27,810
Oh man.

2481
01:19:30,930 --> 01:19:33,610
What do you think about Rival Rivalist so far?

2482
01:19:36,050 --> 01:19:36,690
I...

2483
01:19:36,690 --> 01:19:38,350
Very laggy.

2484
01:19:38,490 --> 01:19:40,270
Because there's no Asian server.

2485
01:19:40,270 --> 01:19:40,610
There's no Asian.

2486
01:19:40,770 --> 01:19:40,910
Yeah.

2487
01:19:40,970 --> 01:19:41,250
Yeah.

2488
01:19:41,450 --> 01:19:42,190
There's a thing.

2489
01:19:42,990 --> 01:19:45,750
I'm trying to enjoy the server.

2490
01:19:45,750 --> 01:19:46,970
It's just too laggy.

2491
01:19:47,130 --> 01:19:49,270
For the movements.

2492
01:19:49,270 --> 01:19:51,070
It's too much.

2493
01:19:51,390 --> 01:19:52,110
Oh my god.

2494
01:19:52,110 --> 01:19:52,950
Have you tried Spider-Man?

2495
01:19:52,990 --> 01:19:54,130
That fucking shit was crazy.

2496
01:19:54,250 --> 01:19:55,810
I main Spider-Man.

2497
01:19:56,950 --> 01:19:57,390
Why?

2498
01:19:57,910 --> 01:19:59,610
Why would you do that to yourself?

2499
01:19:59,610 --> 01:20:00,610
Hey the wall run.

2500
01:20:00,650 --> 01:20:01,930
The wall run is fun.

2501
01:20:02,570 --> 01:20:03,790
Yeah but it was like.

2502
01:20:03,870 --> 01:20:04,990
I tried to play Spider-Man.

2503
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:05,350
I was like.

2504
01:20:06,450 --> 01:20:08,170
Like I wanted to throw up.

2505
01:20:08,390 --> 01:20:08,830
Nah.

2506
01:20:08,830 --> 01:20:08,830
Nah.

2507
01:20:08,830 --> 01:20:10,050
You gotta combo it.

2508
01:20:10,170 --> 01:20:12,510
The motion was so bad.

2509
01:20:13,010 --> 01:20:14,230
You gotta combo it.

2510
01:20:15,270 --> 01:20:15,910
Come on.

2511
01:20:15,910 --> 01:20:18,150
I thought you were good at FPS games.

2512
01:20:18,630 --> 01:20:19,130
What?

2513
01:20:19,230 --> 01:20:19,750
Oh yeah.

2514
01:20:19,830 --> 01:20:20,690
Yeah the fucking.

2515
01:20:21,030 --> 01:20:22,410
Spider-Man melee.

2516
01:20:22,530 --> 01:20:23,750
The FPS games.

2517
01:20:23,910 --> 01:20:24,370
Yeah.

2518
01:20:25,050 --> 01:20:25,550
Yeah.

2519
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:25,750
Yeah.

2520
01:20:25,790 --> 01:20:25,830
Yeah.

2521
01:20:25,830 --> 01:20:26,290
Tangent.

2522
01:20:27,190 --> 01:20:29,070
It's first punching shooter.

2523
01:20:29,430 --> 01:20:30,790
So fucking true.

2524
01:20:31,610 --> 01:20:32,110
Exactly.

2525
01:20:32,230 --> 01:20:33,850
Where's our guy gonna take us?

2526
01:20:35,230 --> 01:20:35,730
Sir.

2527
01:20:35,790 --> 01:20:36,590
Where are you gonna take us?

2528
01:20:36,810 --> 01:20:37,450
Oh he's level 14.

2529
01:20:37,690 --> 01:20:38,630
Wait this guy's a baby.

2530
01:20:39,790 --> 01:20:42,170
This guy's acting like he's level 14.

2531
01:20:42,730 --> 01:20:43,670
Woah woah woah.

2532
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:44,990
We're dropping in the shit.

2533
01:20:45,030 --> 01:20:45,370
Oh shit.

2534
01:20:45,530 --> 01:20:45,890
Hell no.

2535
01:20:45,910 --> 01:20:46,810
No I'm not dropping in the shit.

2536
01:20:46,890 --> 01:20:48,870
Wait is he actually trying to get to the shit?

2537
01:20:49,330 --> 01:20:50,730
He's trying to get to the shit.

2538
01:20:50,830 --> 01:20:52,150
At least he was.

2539
01:20:52,470 --> 01:20:52,610
He's fucking stupid.

2540
01:20:52,810 --> 01:20:54,170
And he didn't reach it.

2541
01:20:54,810 --> 01:20:56,310
Bro he's level 14.

2542
01:20:56,370 --> 01:20:57,590
Of course he's not.

2543
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:02,170
Oh boy.

2544
01:21:03,030 --> 01:21:04,290
Is there anyone near us?

2545
01:21:06,230 --> 01:21:06,910
Probably not.

2546
01:21:07,550 --> 01:21:08,470
Yeah I'm gonna say.

2547
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:09,710
That drop was terrible.

2548
01:21:09,790 --> 01:21:11,690
That drop was a level 14 drop.

2549
01:21:13,890 --> 01:21:15,130
Like oh my god.

2550
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:15,870
That shit was terrible.

2551
01:21:17,030 --> 01:21:18,570
I'm gonna say I head to labs.

2552
01:21:21,650 --> 01:21:24,290
Oh I hear people fighting.

2553
01:21:25,530 --> 01:21:27,030
I'm heading over to the fight.

2554
01:21:28,690 --> 01:21:30,150
Where are you?

2555
01:21:30,210 --> 01:21:30,910
Where are you Tenjin?

2556
01:21:31,110 --> 01:21:31,470
What?

2557
01:21:31,650 --> 01:21:33,250
Movement weird.

2558
01:21:33,550 --> 01:21:34,870
Where the fuck are you?

2559
01:21:35,490 --> 01:21:37,130
I'm going man.

2560
01:21:37,850 --> 01:21:37,990
Where the fuck are you?

2561
01:21:40,010 --> 01:21:41,030
I'm going.

2562
01:21:42,170 --> 01:21:44,290
I might be a little slow.

2563
01:21:44,590 --> 01:21:45,770
Oh I know.

2564
01:21:45,990 --> 01:21:47,950
At least it's something.

2565
01:21:48,430 --> 01:21:50,030
Even if it's stupid.

2566
01:21:52,630 --> 01:21:53,810
Oh I need help.

2567
01:21:55,190 --> 01:21:55,750
Yes.

2568
01:21:55,810 --> 01:21:56,690
I'm right here.

2569
01:21:57,970 --> 01:21:59,010
Holy shit.

2570
01:21:59,230 --> 01:22:00,150
Yeah I definitely need help.

2571
01:22:01,270 --> 01:22:01,830
Oh.

2572
01:22:02,110 --> 01:22:02,770
He's one.

2573
01:22:04,130 --> 01:22:05,050
Oh that's you.

2574
01:22:06,550 --> 01:22:07,110
Okay.

2575
01:22:08,010 --> 01:22:09,230
I have to.

2576
01:22:09,630 --> 01:22:11,090
I have to do stuff.

2577
01:22:12,930 --> 01:22:14,790
Yeah see I knew you got this.

2578
01:22:16,990 --> 01:22:18,250
Wait where's his teammate?

2579
01:22:18,490 --> 01:22:19,410
Oh his teammate's coming.

2580
01:22:21,310 --> 01:22:22,790
Oh his teammate has no armor.

2581
01:22:24,910 --> 01:22:25,470
Okay.

2582
01:22:25,670 --> 01:22:27,430
That was embarrassing for him.

2583
01:22:28,830 --> 01:22:29,890
Uh huh.

2584
01:22:30,030 --> 01:22:33,470
His teammate has no more like armor at all.

2585
01:22:36,250 --> 01:22:36,810
Yay.

2586
01:22:37,230 --> 01:22:38,170
Wanna use that?

2587
01:22:38,810 --> 01:22:39,370
What?

2588
01:22:40,510 --> 01:22:41,070
I'm gonna use that.

2589
01:22:41,090 --> 01:22:41,570
What?

2590
01:22:41,690 --> 01:22:42,330
Ultimix?

2591
01:22:42,370 --> 01:22:42,650
Why?

2592
01:22:43,690 --> 01:22:45,070
This is not rank.

2593
01:22:45,270 --> 01:22:45,810
Tengen?

2594
01:22:46,690 --> 01:22:48,450
Oh yeah it's not rank.

2595
01:22:48,730 --> 01:22:49,890
Who the fuck cares?

2596
01:22:50,270 --> 01:22:51,450
I have PTSD's.

2597
01:22:51,470 --> 01:22:52,810
Who the fuck cares?

2598
01:22:52,870 --> 01:22:54,750
I have PTSD's.

2599
01:22:55,230 --> 01:22:56,170
I can tell.

2600
01:22:57,170 --> 01:23:01,290
We literally have like the ult shit right here too.

2601
01:23:02,050 --> 01:23:03,950
We literally have the charge tower.

2602
01:23:04,130 --> 01:23:05,010
I was like what the fuck?

2603
01:23:06,430 --> 01:23:09,510
I keep forgetting R9 is dog shit now.

2604
01:23:09,590 --> 01:23:10,010
It sucks.

2605
01:23:11,090 --> 01:23:11,410
Yeah same.

2606
01:23:11,670 --> 01:23:13,230
I keep fucking...

2607
01:23:13,230 --> 01:23:16,570
I need to like swap my gun.

2608
01:23:16,910 --> 01:23:19,350
My scroll wheel is double clicking.

2609
01:23:19,650 --> 01:23:19,970
What?

2610
01:23:19,970 --> 01:23:21,990
That is the most annoying part that I'm having.

2611
01:23:21,990 --> 01:23:22,710
Is your mouse broke?

2612
01:23:23,950 --> 01:23:26,850
Yeah I really wanna fix it but then I'm lazy.

2613
01:23:27,270 --> 01:23:27,770
What do you mean?

2614
01:23:27,790 --> 01:23:28,830
Just buy a mouse.

2615
01:23:29,650 --> 01:23:34,710
You and your stuff.

2616
01:23:35,230 --> 01:23:36,550
What do you mean?

2617
01:23:36,810 --> 01:23:37,930
If it's broken.

2618
01:23:38,630 --> 01:23:39,230
Man.

2619
01:23:39,530 --> 01:23:40,810
Hey man I can...

2620
01:23:41,090 --> 01:23:41,490
I can fix it.

2621
01:23:41,570 --> 01:23:43,450
Did you forget where I'm from?

2622
01:23:43,550 --> 01:23:44,790
A third world country.

2623
01:23:44,790 --> 01:23:45,170
Oh true.

2624
01:23:45,510 --> 01:23:49,770
Just go out and buy it so you don't have to worry about customs.

2625
01:23:49,830 --> 01:23:51,310
Yeah go through the jungle and...

2626
01:23:51,310 --> 01:23:53,650
Yeah go through the jungle and then...

2627
01:23:53,650 --> 01:23:55,570
There has to be mouse stores.

2628
01:23:56,190 --> 01:23:58,310
And miss money bags.

2629
01:23:58,630 --> 01:24:00,270
No he's talking about customs.

2630
01:24:00,890 --> 01:24:03,030
He's not talking about like...

2631
01:24:03,030 --> 01:24:04,970
Not being able to afford it.

2632
01:24:05,050 --> 01:24:06,110
He's talking about customs.

2633
01:24:06,810 --> 01:24:11,070
Cause like Indonesian customs is like terrible when it comes to shopping.

2634
01:24:11,090 --> 01:24:11,330
Yeah.

2635
01:24:11,330 --> 01:24:11,630
Like shipping stuff.

2636
01:24:13,090 --> 01:24:13,610
Yes.

2637
01:24:14,070 --> 01:24:15,770
Even though like...

2638
01:24:15,770 --> 01:24:17,690
You know you declare it.

2639
01:24:17,750 --> 01:24:18,290
Oh it's a gift.

2640
01:24:18,490 --> 01:24:20,130
And they're like no it's not.

2641
01:24:20,350 --> 01:24:21,650
Yeah so like...

2642
01:24:21,650 --> 01:24:23,570
And then you get like taxed or whatever right?

2643
01:24:24,950 --> 01:24:26,070
Yeah isn't there like...

2644
01:24:26,070 --> 01:24:27,050
I'm calling them out.

2645
01:24:27,530 --> 01:24:28,050
Legit.

2646
01:24:28,110 --> 01:24:30,790
What are they gonna do like send somebody over?

2647
01:24:31,290 --> 01:24:34,650
They're gonna charge me for something that I didn't order.

2648
01:24:34,950 --> 01:24:38,330
If Tenzin doesn't show up for his own debut tomorrow.

2649
01:24:38,490 --> 01:24:39,770
We know what happened.

2650
01:24:40,350 --> 01:24:43,770
Even if there's documents like declaring this is a gift.

2651
01:24:43,850 --> 01:24:45,430
Gift cannot be like you know.

2652
01:24:45,510 --> 01:24:46,750
You can't charge that shit.

2653
01:24:46,910 --> 01:24:47,990
And they're like nuh uh.

2654
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:49,130
It's not a gift.

2655
01:24:49,490 --> 01:24:50,390
You got this.

2656
01:24:50,570 --> 01:24:52,150
Yeah so just go out and...

2657
01:24:53,610 --> 01:24:54,130
Just...

2658
01:24:54,130 --> 01:24:55,770
Can you go out and like...

2659
01:24:55,770 --> 01:24:58,070
Buy a mouse?

2660
01:24:58,250 --> 01:24:58,610
Mouse.

2661
01:25:01,630 --> 01:25:02,810
Can you just do that?

2662
01:25:03,070 --> 01:25:04,790
I don't even know what to buy now.

2663
01:25:05,090 --> 01:25:07,570
Just fucking get a G Pro Wireless.

2664
01:25:08,030 --> 01:25:08,550
Again?

2665
01:25:09,770 --> 01:25:10,970
I mean that's the classic.

2666
01:25:12,250 --> 01:25:14,770
I'm using G Pro Wireless.

2667
01:25:14,810 --> 01:25:17,750
Yeah but aren't you like... isn't your G Pro Wireless fucking up right now?

2668
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:19,710
Only the scroll wheel.

2669
01:25:19,850 --> 01:25:21,090
I can change the switches.

2670
01:25:21,550 --> 01:25:23,650
Like I did with the other clicks.

2671
01:25:24,550 --> 01:25:26,370
You're just gonna change your bindings?

2672
01:25:27,150 --> 01:25:28,350
No, I soldered it.

2673
01:25:29,570 --> 01:25:31,910
Like I tear it apart, I soldered my shit.

2674
01:25:31,990 --> 01:25:33,110
Oh man, that's so much work.

2675
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:36,510
I swapped it with a better switch.

2676
01:25:36,510 --> 01:25:38,890
Yeah but like it's so much easier to just...

2677
01:25:38,890 --> 01:25:41,530
Doesn't have that mushy click when I bought it on day one.

2678
01:25:41,830 --> 01:25:44,510
But it's so much easier to just, you know...

2679
01:25:46,350 --> 01:25:48,270
Wait, to our left?

2680
01:25:49,650 --> 01:25:50,970
There's people to my right.

2681
01:25:51,130 --> 01:25:53,090
Someone's dropping over there.

2682
01:25:53,250 --> 01:25:54,750
Yeah, it's a full team.

2683
01:25:55,770 --> 01:25:56,870
I think they saw me.

2684
01:25:58,210 --> 01:25:59,530
Wait, what the fuck?

2685
01:25:59,710 --> 01:26:00,770
There's another team here.

2686
01:26:01,110 --> 01:26:01,630
Right there.

2687
01:26:03,370 --> 01:26:04,630
Yeah, I think they saw you man.

2688
01:26:04,810 --> 01:26:06,410
I think they saw me too.

2689
01:26:06,510 --> 01:26:08,650
I think they saw you.

2690
01:26:08,770 --> 01:26:09,950
I think they saw me.

2691
01:26:10,050 --> 01:26:11,210
Dude, we're fucked!

2692
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:13,010
I think they saw both of you.

2693
01:26:14,050 --> 01:26:14,970
Dude, we're fucked.

2694
01:26:14,970 --> 01:26:15,570
There's two teams.

2695
01:26:18,790 --> 01:26:19,870
There's two teams!

2696
01:26:20,490 --> 01:26:21,810
I think we're both fucked.

2697
01:26:22,790 --> 01:26:23,970
Bro, there's two teams.

2698
01:26:24,250 --> 01:26:25,330
I think we're both fucked, guys.

2699
01:26:26,230 --> 01:26:26,830
Uh-huh.

2700
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:29,250
I don't think they saw me, right?

2701
01:26:30,030 --> 01:26:30,470
No!

2702
01:26:30,490 --> 01:26:30,690
Aye.

2703
01:26:31,510 --> 01:26:31,950
Yep.

2704
01:26:33,870 --> 01:26:35,970
They wouldn't see you.

2705
01:26:36,950 --> 01:26:37,910
They wouldn't see you.

2706
01:26:37,930 --> 01:26:38,910
How would they see you?

2707
01:26:38,910 --> 01:26:39,590
How would they know?

2708
01:26:39,630 --> 01:26:40,250
I don't know.

2709
01:26:40,310 --> 01:26:40,750
They don't know.

2710
01:26:41,230 --> 01:26:42,050
How would they know?

2711
01:26:42,190 --> 01:26:42,670
They don't know.

2712
01:26:42,750 --> 01:26:42,790
They don't know.

2713
01:26:42,790 --> 01:26:43,170
They don't know.

2714
01:26:43,230 --> 01:26:43,930
They wouldn't know.

2715
01:26:44,030 --> 01:26:44,770
They wouldn't know.

2716
01:26:44,790 --> 01:26:45,270
Who the fuck shot me in the back?

2717
01:26:45,270 --> 01:26:45,710
They know.

2718
01:26:47,030 --> 01:26:48,570
I got away for so long.

2719
01:26:48,670 --> 01:26:48,890
Just go.

2720
01:26:48,890 --> 01:26:50,630
I got away for so long!

2721
01:26:53,650 --> 01:26:54,810
So they did know.

2722
01:26:54,910 --> 01:26:55,330
How did they know?

2723
01:26:56,390 --> 01:26:57,210
No, they're hacking.

2724
01:26:57,210 --> 01:26:57,970
So they did know.

2725
01:26:58,050 --> 01:26:58,870
They're hacking.

2726
01:26:59,110 --> 01:26:59,930
There's no way.

2727
01:27:00,210 --> 01:27:00,390
Yeah, for real.

2728
01:27:00,770 --> 01:27:01,170
Shit.

2729
01:27:01,530 --> 01:27:02,390
There's no way.

2730
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:05,070
Somebody get those, like, IP ban.

2731
01:27:05,070 --> 01:27:07,410
Ah, hardware ban!

2732
01:27:10,090 --> 01:27:10,810
Somebody...

2733
01:27:12,550 --> 01:27:13,270
What?

2734
01:27:13,670 --> 01:27:14,390
What.

2735
01:27:14,610 --> 01:27:17,570
Did somebody just super chat for you to get a mouse?

2736
01:27:17,870 --> 01:27:19,610
Mmm, more-more or less.

2737
01:27:21,430 --> 01:27:23,050
Courtesy of the Dragoons.

2738
01:27:23,050 --> 01:27:24,830
Somebody was like, what the fuck.

2739
01:27:27,650 --> 01:27:28,930
That's craaaauen overly.

2740
01:27:28,930 --> 01:27:29,470
Mouse fun!

2741
01:27:29,830 --> 01:27:32,030
Go fucking get a better mouse!

2742
01:27:33,950 --> 01:27:35,050
Yeah, but like, this is...

2743
01:27:35,070 --> 01:27:35,830
I could fix this.

2744
01:27:36,190 --> 01:27:38,890
And how long have you been having this problem?

2745
01:27:40,450 --> 01:27:41,690
Just like two months.

2746
01:27:41,990 --> 01:27:42,890
Bro, what the fuck?

2747
01:27:43,150 --> 01:27:44,290
When did you...

2748
01:27:46,330 --> 01:27:48,110
I could fix this.

2749
01:27:50,310 --> 01:27:53,150
Yeah, why fix when can buy?

2750
01:27:53,230 --> 01:27:53,390
No!

2751
01:27:53,730 --> 01:27:56,510
Yeah, that's my motto.

2752
01:27:59,110 --> 01:27:59,670
That's crazy.

2753
01:28:01,570 --> 01:28:03,470
That's what I do.

2754
01:28:04,610 --> 01:28:05,190
Exactly.

2755
01:28:05,810 --> 01:28:07,470
That's what you do.

2756
01:28:07,790 --> 01:28:10,610
Why fix when I can just buy?

2757
01:28:11,010 --> 01:28:13,070
Because I can fix it.

2758
01:28:13,190 --> 01:28:14,470
And I can't buy it.

2759
01:28:14,470 --> 01:28:15,410
That's so much work.

2760
01:28:20,810 --> 01:28:21,670
Monetarily wise?

2761
01:28:22,970 --> 01:28:23,550
Yeah.

2762
01:28:23,590 --> 01:28:24,910
I guess I can buy it.

2763
01:28:25,190 --> 01:28:25,770
Yeah!

2764
01:28:26,690 --> 01:28:28,990
But then I'll just change the switch immediately.

2765
01:28:29,430 --> 01:28:31,550
You're not even... yeah, you can sell the old one.

2766
01:28:32,670 --> 01:28:33,250
Yeah.

2767
01:28:33,470 --> 01:28:33,850
I'm free love.

2768
01:28:34,430 --> 01:28:34,870
Signed.

2769
01:28:34,870 --> 01:28:35,130
Yeah, see?

2770
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:36,530
Oh my god, you just...

2771
01:28:36,530 --> 01:28:37,910
You can do that now.

2772
01:28:37,970 --> 01:28:39,230
You can auction off your...

2773
01:28:40,370 --> 01:28:40,810
Wait!

2774
01:28:41,930 --> 01:28:42,670
You could!

2775
01:28:42,690 --> 01:28:45,110
You sign the mouse and then you auction it off.

2776
01:28:45,230 --> 01:28:45,330
I could.

2777
01:28:46,810 --> 01:28:49,630
But like, I do have to point out the disclaimer.

2778
01:28:49,830 --> 01:28:51,190
It doesn't come with my skills.

2779
01:28:51,930 --> 01:28:54,690
I mean, I don't think that's what they want from them.

2780
01:28:54,850 --> 01:28:57,410
I mean, you don't know my fans.

2781
01:28:57,450 --> 01:28:59,410
I think other stuff is gonna be done.

2782
01:28:59,590 --> 01:29:00,410
No, no, no.

2783
01:29:00,470 --> 01:29:03,150
I think other stuff is gonna be done with your mouse.

2784
01:29:03,150 --> 01:29:03,450
They'll be desperate.

2785
01:29:05,710 --> 01:29:06,150
Ewww!

2786
01:29:08,390 --> 01:29:08,830
Ewww!

2787
01:29:08,830 --> 01:29:09,030
Ewww!

2788
01:29:09,030 --> 01:29:09,770
What do you mean, eww?

2789
01:29:10,410 --> 01:29:11,590
It's like a collection.

2790
01:29:12,030 --> 01:29:12,370
Eww!

2791
01:29:13,590 --> 01:29:14,030
Eww!

2792
01:29:14,850 --> 01:29:17,610
Yeah, it comes with the gamer sweat.

2793
01:29:17,650 --> 01:29:18,030
What skills?

2794
01:29:18,210 --> 01:29:19,430
Indeed, I don't have one.

2795
01:29:21,130 --> 01:29:22,330
The gamer sweat.

2796
01:29:23,290 --> 01:29:24,770
Yeah, it just comes with my sweat.

2797
01:29:25,290 --> 01:29:26,450
Yeah, and then...

2798
01:29:27,550 --> 01:29:29,010
Oh yeah, they like that.

2799
01:29:29,050 --> 01:29:29,430
What the fuck?

2800
01:29:29,450 --> 01:29:30,250
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

2801
01:29:31,110 --> 01:29:31,750
What the hell?

2802
01:29:33,070 --> 01:29:36,250
That sounds like they're not buying it for the skills.

2803
01:29:36,570 --> 01:29:38,570
Put the mouse in the what?

2804
01:29:38,730 --> 01:29:39,470
The jar?

2805
01:29:39,970 --> 01:29:41,670
Oh, what the fuck?

2806
01:29:41,770 --> 01:29:44,110
Okay, but Tengen, think about the amount of money you'll get.

2807
01:29:47,930 --> 01:29:49,150
Think about it.

2808
01:29:49,450 --> 01:29:49,950
No.

2809
01:29:50,530 --> 01:29:52,070
You know it's tempting.

2810
01:29:53,130 --> 01:29:55,190
You should auction it off.

2811
01:29:55,670 --> 01:29:57,710
And then if it's signed too.

2812
01:30:01,790 --> 01:30:02,690
What the fuck?

2813
01:30:02,690 --> 01:30:03,770
A mouse smitten me!

2814
01:30:03,990 --> 01:30:06,250
I'm just helping Tengen make money.

2815
01:30:06,390 --> 01:30:06,950
What do you mean?

2816
01:30:08,450 --> 01:30:09,010
Dude!

2817
01:30:09,830 --> 01:30:10,850
Wait, what the fuck?

2818
01:30:10,930 --> 01:30:12,590
Bro, this guy...

2819
01:30:12,590 --> 01:30:14,390
I think this guy's special.

2820
01:30:16,670 --> 01:30:18,830
Did you just go around and call people special?

2821
01:30:18,990 --> 01:30:21,030
No, you should've seen what I just saw.

2822
01:30:21,430 --> 01:30:21,990
Like...

2823
01:30:22,870 --> 01:30:23,430
Okay.

2824
01:30:24,010 --> 01:30:27,290
You should've seen what I saw.

2825
01:30:27,290 --> 01:30:29,530
You literally stood there to get shot at.

2826
01:30:29,650 --> 01:30:32,450
For like at least five seconds.

2827
01:30:33,550 --> 01:30:34,650
They're like right here.

2828
01:30:35,670 --> 01:30:37,050
He's definitely special.

2829
01:30:39,690 --> 01:30:40,210
What?

2830
01:30:41,010 --> 01:30:43,230
I'm trying to figure out...

2831
01:30:43,230 --> 01:30:43,750
Do you know where they are?

2832
01:30:43,910 --> 01:30:46,090
Like below me?

2833
01:30:46,310 --> 01:30:46,730
Hey.

2834
01:30:50,690 --> 01:30:51,730
Are we fine?

2835
01:30:52,090 --> 01:30:52,250
Ha!

2836
01:30:52,750 --> 01:30:53,270
Ha!

2837
01:30:53,770 --> 01:30:54,270
Ha!

2838
01:30:55,110 --> 01:30:56,190
Oh, you'll be fine?

2839
01:30:56,810 --> 01:30:57,970
Oh, you got them.

2840
01:30:59,330 --> 01:31:00,590
Where's his teammate though?

2841
01:31:01,070 --> 01:31:02,590
I'm in the sky waiting.

2842
01:31:04,390 --> 01:31:04,870
Surely.

2843
01:31:05,970 --> 01:31:07,090
Does he have heavy ammo?

2844
01:31:07,690 --> 01:31:09,230
Is this a special guy?

2845
01:31:09,310 --> 01:31:10,270
Guy I almost killed?

2846
01:31:10,390 --> 01:31:10,510
No.

2847
01:31:11,470 --> 01:31:11,950
Probably.

2848
01:31:12,330 --> 01:31:13,130
No, it's not.

2849
01:31:13,410 --> 01:31:13,950
Let me know you're fine.

2850
01:31:14,050 --> 01:31:14,590
Oh, wait, I hear him.

2851
01:31:16,310 --> 01:31:17,790
Let me know you guys find heavy ammo.

2852
01:31:20,090 --> 01:31:21,290
Oh, there he is.

2853
01:31:21,750 --> 01:31:22,230
Oh.

2854
01:31:23,110 --> 01:31:24,610
Was that the special kid?

2855
01:31:25,690 --> 01:31:26,890
What did he do?

2856
01:31:28,850 --> 01:31:29,890
What did he do?

2857
01:31:31,530 --> 01:31:32,310
What did he do?

2858
01:31:33,310 --> 01:31:34,110
What happened?

2859
01:31:34,390 --> 01:31:35,570
What the fuck did he do?

2860
01:31:36,990 --> 01:31:41,330
Okay, he blasted the whole Spitfire at me and didn't hit a single one.

2861
01:31:41,450 --> 01:31:41,530
Oh.

2862
01:31:42,090 --> 01:31:44,370
I am like shotgun range man.

2863
01:31:44,390 --> 01:31:45,390
That might have been him.

2864
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:47,810
That might have been him.

2865
01:31:49,070 --> 01:31:50,130
I told you.

2866
01:31:50,270 --> 01:31:51,130
He's special.

2867
01:31:52,550 --> 01:31:53,010
Oh.

2868
01:31:53,050 --> 01:31:53,490
Oh, wait, wait.

2869
01:31:53,730 --> 01:31:55,850
To my right, I see the sniper.

2870
01:31:56,890 --> 01:31:58,450
Oh, wait, he's actually hitting you.

2871
01:31:59,170 --> 01:32:00,070
Nice scream.

2872
01:32:02,030 --> 01:32:03,070
Please stop.

2873
01:32:03,230 --> 01:32:03,650
I'm scared.

2874
01:32:03,870 --> 01:32:05,090
Okay, Valkyrie.

2875
01:32:08,490 --> 01:32:09,010
Okay.

2876
01:32:09,470 --> 01:32:09,990
Okay.

2877
01:32:10,250 --> 01:32:10,770
Okay.

2878
01:32:11,430 --> 01:32:13,210
I don't know where his teammates are.

2879
01:32:14,390 --> 01:32:18,030
Like, this guy is definitely...

2880
01:32:18,030 --> 01:32:18,230
Like, this guy is definitely...

2881
01:32:18,230 --> 01:32:20,990
Wait, I'm getting shot from a second cross.

2882
01:32:22,170 --> 01:32:22,690
Wait, I'm getting shot from a second cross.

2883
01:32:22,690 --> 01:32:23,310
I'm getting shot from a cross.

2884
01:32:24,150 --> 01:32:24,930
Am I right?

2885
01:32:25,150 --> 01:32:25,310
Am I right?

2886
01:32:27,590 --> 01:32:28,490
Oh, nice.

2887
01:32:31,650 --> 01:32:32,330
Alright.

2888
01:32:33,070 --> 01:32:34,710
Yeah, this feels like...

2889
01:32:34,710 --> 01:32:36,390
This feels like Singapore servers.

2890
01:32:39,270 --> 01:32:39,950
The...

2891
01:32:39,950 --> 01:32:40,230
The...

2892
01:32:40,850 --> 01:32:44,710
The different ranges of fucking skills in this lobby.

2893
01:32:44,830 --> 01:32:45,250
Yeah.

2894
01:32:47,650 --> 01:32:48,330
Yeah.

2895
01:32:48,910 --> 01:32:51,710
This is how it goes down here.

2896
01:32:51,870 --> 01:32:52,250
Yeah.

2897
01:32:52,390 --> 01:32:54,550
The wild west, that's for sure.

2898
01:32:56,430 --> 01:32:57,970
I saw the Valk...

2899
01:32:57,970 --> 01:33:00,390
I saw the Valk literally just like fucking...

2900
01:33:00,390 --> 01:33:01,450
I saw the Valk literally just like fucking...

2901
01:33:01,450 --> 01:33:03,950
like M1 flew to my face.

2902
01:33:04,210 --> 01:33:04,970
And I'm like, okay.

2903
01:33:05,310 --> 01:33:06,490
I mean, okay.

2904
01:33:08,730 --> 01:33:09,670
That's the play.

2905
01:33:10,590 --> 01:33:12,930
I'm gonna fucking grab the...

2906
01:33:12,930 --> 01:33:13,750
I'm gonna fucking grab the...

2907
01:33:14,270 --> 01:33:15,010
armor shit.

2908
01:33:15,330 --> 01:33:17,230
I wanna have that care package.

2909
01:33:17,570 --> 01:33:21,210
That next lifeline care package.

2910
01:33:22,230 --> 01:33:23,910
That next lifeline care package.

2911
01:33:26,730 --> 01:33:27,290
Okay.

2912
01:33:28,190 --> 01:33:29,550
Another squad, what?

2913
01:33:29,770 --> 01:33:31,090
Is there... oh, the...

2914
01:33:31,090 --> 01:33:33,910
Oh, okay.

2915
01:33:33,910 --> 01:33:35,910
Oh, okay.

2916
01:33:38,700 --> 01:33:40,960
Yeah, two golden triple taking one squad.

2917
01:33:41,060 --> 01:33:42,420
I don't get what they're doing, but hey.

2918
01:33:43,100 --> 01:33:44,360
Where are they?

2919
01:33:45,140 --> 01:33:46,780
Where are they, Tengen?

2920
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:48,600
It's King's Canyon, I'm not sure.

2921
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:49,120
Tengen!

2922
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:50,720
Where are they?

2923
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:52,500
Over there.

2924
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:53,420
Where's there?

2925
01:33:54,580 --> 01:33:55,020
There.

2926
01:33:55,020 --> 01:33:56,080
Wait, are they actually?

2927
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:57,960
Wait, oh my god, they are!

2928
01:33:58,180 --> 01:33:58,680
What the fuck?

2929
01:33:58,740 --> 01:33:59,400
How did you see it?

2930
01:34:00,300 --> 01:34:01,400
Oh, he's fucking dead.

2931
01:34:02,380 --> 01:34:02,820
Oh.

2932
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:03,940
Oh.

2933
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:04,480
Goodbye.

2934
01:34:04,900 --> 01:34:05,660
Get outta there, man.

2935
01:34:06,660 --> 01:34:07,560
Get outta there.

2936
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:08,480
Goodbye.

2937
01:34:09,340 --> 01:34:10,400
Get outta there, bro.

2938
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:11,740
Bro, get outta there.

2939
01:34:11,740 --> 01:34:12,640
I'm coming over, I'm coming over.

2940
01:34:12,940 --> 01:34:14,320
I'm meeting the lifeline.

2941
01:34:14,460 --> 01:34:15,120
Get outta there.

2942
01:34:15,480 --> 01:34:19,080
I think he also is a little special too.

2943
01:34:23,540 --> 01:34:24,540
Oh, you saw that, no?

2944
01:34:24,900 --> 01:34:25,180
Yep.

2945
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:26,980
Take it, take a sip.

2946
01:34:28,360 --> 01:34:29,820
Don't take a sip, don't take a sip, don't take a sip!

2947
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:31,520
Shit, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead!

2948
01:34:31,620 --> 01:34:32,380
Cover me, cover me!

2949
01:34:32,780 --> 01:34:33,480
What do you mean?

2950
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:33,880
No!

2951
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:41,480
I can't believe you guys just let them do that to me.

2952
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:42,900
That's fucked up.

2953
01:34:44,020 --> 01:34:45,800
Okay, Tengen, do not... Tengen, no!

2954
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:46,280
Oh, he's so low!

2955
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:47,220
What is he doing?

2956
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:50,500
Bro, I hit two shots!

2957
01:34:50,900 --> 01:34:51,460
Oh no.

2958
01:34:52,620 --> 01:34:53,900
Legit, I hit two shots.

2959
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:54,320
They rez, they rez.

2960
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:56,040
Oh no, they rez.

2961
01:34:56,420 --> 01:34:57,740
I hear her, the rez.

2962
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:00,580
Oh my god, he's jumping over.

2963
01:35:00,660 --> 01:35:02,100
He's on the roof, he's spiderman-ing.

2964
01:35:02,660 --> 01:35:03,300
Oh crap.

2965
01:35:04,020 --> 01:35:05,260
He's on the roof, Tengen!

2966
01:35:06,900 --> 01:35:08,740
Oh my god, the bloodhound's coming over too!

2967
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:13,060
Okay, you gotta make sure the lifeline doesn't rez him.

2968
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:13,860
You gotta heal, you gotta heal.

2969
01:35:13,860 --> 01:35:14,920
Where is my friend?

2970
01:35:15,020 --> 01:35:16,440
He's over there, he's over there!

2971
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:16,780
I'm watching!

2972
01:35:16,780 --> 01:35:17,540
What is he doing?

2973
01:35:17,660 --> 01:35:18,040
Shoot!

2974
01:35:18,260 --> 01:35:19,400
I'm watching, I'm watching!

2975
01:35:20,940 --> 01:35:22,600
Oh my god, the lifeline's rez-ing!

2976
01:35:22,660 --> 01:35:23,540
The lifeline's rez-ing!

2977
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:25,840
Bro, where is my friend?

2978
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:27,520
Bro, he's special, okay?

2979
01:35:27,900 --> 01:35:29,220
He missed?

2980
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:31,700
Okay...

2981
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:33,400
You should really...

2982
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:34,680
Oh no.

2983
01:35:36,060 --> 01:35:36,640
Oh no.

2984
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:40,220
I'm spraying left and right for you.

2985
01:35:40,280 --> 01:35:40,500
Oh my...

2986
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:42,260
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead!

2987
01:35:44,860 --> 01:35:45,320
Okay.

2988
01:35:45,340 --> 01:35:45,940
I have...

2989
01:35:45,940 --> 01:35:47,820
I have... I fucked up.

2990
01:35:47,900 --> 01:35:49,020
I... I... I...

2991
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:51,460
Okay, I would admit... I have aneurysm.

2992
01:35:51,620 --> 01:35:55,580
I would admit I did do something a little special today.

2993
01:35:59,540 --> 01:36:01,180
I'm gonna have a stroke.

2994
01:36:01,380 --> 01:36:09,160
I swear, I blasted like three mags to people, two people are low, my friend's behind just charging himself.

2995
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:11,420
Oh my god!

2996
01:36:12,680 --> 01:36:14,440
Oh my god.

2997
01:36:17,220 --> 01:36:18,180
That was...

2998
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:19,320
Uh...

2999
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:23,840
Oh, we have a bot.

3000
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:24,820
Oh, we have a bot.

3001
01:36:24,820 --> 01:36:25,700
Oh, it's okay, we...

3002
01:36:25,700 --> 01:36:26,720
It's okay.

3003
01:36:27,700 --> 01:36:30,040
I just... I got a little bit too...

3004
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:30,480
You know what?

3005
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:31,400
I'm gonna...

3006
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:33,440
I'm gonna actually... I'm gonna play the game.

3007
01:36:34,380 --> 01:36:35,620
You're gonna actually...

3008
01:36:35,620 --> 01:36:37,580
You're gonna actually play the game!

3009
01:36:37,580 --> 01:36:38,720
No way.

3010
01:36:39,340 --> 01:36:41,740
I've been autopiloting as well the whole time.

3011
01:36:42,180 --> 01:36:42,320
No way.

3012
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:42,320
I've been autopiloting as well the whole time.

3013
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:45,460
Oh man.

3014
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:48,920
I'm gonna actually play the game this time.

3015
01:36:50,440 --> 01:36:51,900
She's actually playing.

3016
01:36:52,060 --> 01:36:53,800
Oh my god, this is it.

3017
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:55,240
There's no way.

3018
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:57,320
This is it.

3019
01:36:57,540 --> 01:36:59,100
I didn't know you played Bangalore.

3020
01:36:59,340 --> 01:37:00,460
Oh my god, really?

3021
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:02,600
Oh yeah, you just met me so you don't know.

3022
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:06,880
Right.

3023
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:07,540
Yeah.

3024
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:08,840
You just found out.

3025
01:37:10,060 --> 01:37:11,880
Don't worry, I'm gonna show you.

3026
01:37:12,700 --> 01:37:13,820
Yeah, what do you play?

3027
01:37:13,820 --> 01:37:14,680
Dungeon?

3028
01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:16,340
What do I play?

3029
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:17,500
Yeah, who do you main?

3030
01:37:18,820 --> 01:37:19,260
Hmm...

3031
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:22,000
Shit, who did I main?

3032
01:37:23,700 --> 01:37:24,740
I just fail.

3033
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:25,400
I fail.

3034
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:26,300
I'll be honest.

3035
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:29,740
I have no...

3036
01:37:30,820 --> 01:37:33,080
boundaries of who to play and what to play.

3037
01:37:33,260 --> 01:37:33,440
Really?

3038
01:37:34,300 --> 01:37:34,740
Yeah.

3039
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:36,480
And you used to play something before?

3040
01:37:38,820 --> 01:37:39,700
What was it?

3041
01:37:39,780 --> 01:37:40,320
You have like...

3042
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:40,980
Huh.

3043
01:37:42,380 --> 01:37:43,300
You used to play...

3044
01:37:43,820 --> 01:37:47,000
You mentioned it before to me when we met like a couple of days ago.

3045
01:37:47,240 --> 01:37:47,860
Was it Newcastle?

3046
01:37:48,660 --> 01:37:49,360
Yeah, sure.

3047
01:37:51,060 --> 01:37:52,640
Oh my god.

3048
01:37:52,820 --> 01:37:53,820
There's 20 people on me.

3049
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:54,660
There's 20 people on me.

3050
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:58,780
Yeah, because you have a goddamn trail on your ass.

3051
01:37:59,660 --> 01:38:02,040
You thought there's 20 people on me.

3052
01:38:02,140 --> 01:38:03,100
Oh my god.

3053
01:38:03,700 --> 01:38:05,060
That's a whole ass...

3054
01:38:05,060 --> 01:38:05,980
I told you!

3055
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:09,140
There's 20 people on my ass!

3056
01:38:10,220 --> 01:38:11,640
Oh my god.

3057
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:15,720
Oh my god.

3058
01:38:16,040 --> 01:38:17,260
Okay, I am okay.

3059
01:38:18,060 --> 01:38:18,480
Wait, what?

3060
01:38:18,620 --> 01:38:19,120
I can't click.

3061
01:38:19,380 --> 01:38:19,960
Behind you!

3062
01:38:19,980 --> 01:38:20,080
Behind you!

3063
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:20,320
Behind you!

3064
01:38:21,820 --> 01:38:23,720
There's another guy to our right as well.

3065
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:27,260
I'm just gonna walk away.

3066
01:38:27,720 --> 01:38:29,060
But you can rush me against this door.

3067
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:30,020
It'll be safe.

3068
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:31,100
Where are you?

3069
01:38:31,180 --> 01:38:31,540
Right here?

3070
01:38:31,820 --> 01:38:32,400
Wait, it's okay.

3071
01:38:32,440 --> 01:38:33,240
Our guys can rush me.

3072
01:38:33,260 --> 01:38:33,460
Wait, wait, wait.

3073
01:38:33,700 --> 01:38:33,980
There's more.

3074
01:38:34,260 --> 01:38:35,020
Yeah, our guys...

3075
01:38:35,580 --> 01:38:35,940
No.

3076
01:38:36,280 --> 01:38:37,040
Oh no.

3077
01:38:37,240 --> 01:38:38,720
I'm like... The door is...

3078
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:39,840
No!

3079
01:38:41,580 --> 01:38:42,580
There's more people!

3080
01:38:42,900 --> 01:38:43,660
Bro, I fucking...

3081
01:38:43,820 --> 01:38:44,340
No!

3082
01:38:44,420 --> 01:38:45,740
I said there's a lot!

3083
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:48,560
Why did we land here?

3084
01:38:48,940 --> 01:38:49,340
You!

3085
01:38:49,460 --> 01:38:50,800
I was not jumpmaster!

3086
01:38:51,480 --> 01:38:52,860
Oh yeah, you was not.

3087
01:38:57,460 --> 01:38:58,300
You got this.

3088
01:38:58,920 --> 01:38:59,600
Where is he?

3089
01:39:00,260 --> 01:39:00,880
Right there.

3090
01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:01,760
Okay.

3091
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:04,940
Okay, they're fighting each other.

3092
01:39:04,940 --> 01:39:05,360
They're fighting each other.

3093
01:39:06,700 --> 01:39:08,000
No way!

3094
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:10,680
You're not doing this.

3095
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:11,640
Are you?

3096
01:39:11,820 --> 01:39:13,700
Are you?

3097
01:39:17,010 --> 01:39:18,310
No!

3098
01:39:18,470 --> 01:39:19,070
Oh my god.

3099
01:39:20,010 --> 01:39:21,710
Oh god.

3100
01:39:26,190 --> 01:39:27,450
Oh god.

3101
01:39:27,630 --> 01:39:28,170
No!

3102
01:39:28,450 --> 01:39:29,510
He can't... No!

3103
01:39:29,530 --> 01:39:30,170
Swap!

3104
01:39:30,590 --> 01:39:31,190
Swap!

3105
01:39:32,450 --> 01:39:33,850
Oh my god!

3106
01:39:34,750 --> 01:39:35,550
Bro!

3107
01:39:36,450 --> 01:39:38,570
I'm having that moment!

3108
01:39:38,710 --> 01:39:41,050
Are you fucking kidding me?

3109
01:39:42,190 --> 01:39:43,750
Bro, we win!

3110
01:39:43,810 --> 01:39:46,370
Okay, that was pretty game-y though.

3111
01:39:46,370 --> 01:39:46,870
Dude.

3112
01:39:47,150 --> 01:39:49,350
That was pretty game-y.

3113
01:39:49,470 --> 01:39:51,970
Yeah, that is awesome.

3114
01:39:51,990 --> 01:39:52,670
That was sick.

3115
01:39:52,670 --> 01:39:53,710
Honestly, that was clean.

3116
01:39:54,170 --> 01:39:57,030
But the timing could not have been better but that got out.

3117
01:39:57,030 --> 01:39:57,050
That was pretty clean.

3118
01:39:57,550 --> 01:39:59,550
That was pretty fucking clean.

3119
01:39:59,590 --> 01:40:02,590
I hit all those shots that I needed to hit there.

3120
01:40:04,170 --> 01:40:04,770
Yeah.

3121
01:40:04,770 --> 01:40:05,190
Holy shit.

3122
01:40:05,310 --> 01:40:07,250
That was awesome.

3123
01:40:07,470 --> 01:40:09,150
Yeah, that was pretty clean.

3124
01:40:11,070 --> 01:40:11,670
Spitfire.

3125
01:40:11,690 --> 01:40:13,790
If only our fucking...

3126
01:40:13,790 --> 01:40:17,350
If our guy still had his shield, I think I could have clutched it.

3127
01:40:17,490 --> 01:40:19,990
But the Rampart shit fucked him up.

3128
01:40:20,270 --> 01:40:22,590
The Rampart shit was too good.

3129
01:40:25,870 --> 01:40:26,990
Oh my god.

3130
01:40:27,210 --> 01:40:27,690
Okay.

3131
01:40:28,030 --> 01:40:30,310
We can't end until we win, Tenjin.

3132
01:40:30,910 --> 01:40:32,110
We're gonna be here forever.

3133
01:40:32,350 --> 01:40:33,310
We're ending?

3134
01:40:33,650 --> 01:40:33,990
Nah.

3135
01:40:34,490 --> 01:40:35,050
Nah.

3136
01:40:36,770 --> 01:40:37,570
What's that?

3137
01:40:38,310 --> 01:40:39,150
Funny word.

3138
01:40:39,750 --> 01:40:41,670
We don't end until I win.

3139
01:40:41,970 --> 01:40:42,690
Alright, let's be serious.

3140
01:40:46,250 --> 01:40:48,630
Oh, now you wanna be serious.

3141
01:40:49,230 --> 01:40:49,810
Oh, now you wanna be serious.

3142
01:40:50,450 --> 01:40:50,890
Wow.

3143
01:40:52,430 --> 01:40:53,290
Alright, here we go.

3144
01:40:54,410 --> 01:40:55,870
I told you I was playing for real.

3145
01:40:56,670 --> 01:40:59,110
Yeah, we're playing for real now.

3146
01:40:59,290 --> 01:41:00,490
Yeah, I told you guys.

3147
01:41:00,650 --> 01:41:01,590
We're playing for real.

3148
01:41:02,850 --> 01:41:04,210
For real, for reals.

3149
01:41:04,490 --> 01:41:04,930
Yeah.

3150
01:41:05,950 --> 01:41:06,710
We're gamers.

3151
01:41:08,530 --> 01:41:10,950
That boy is ready to sleep, to be fair.

3152
01:41:11,090 --> 01:41:11,210
That boy is ready to sleep, to be fair.

3153
01:41:11,210 --> 01:41:16,570
He like, before we started this stream, he was like, Oh man, my fucking stomach.

3154
01:41:17,650 --> 01:41:18,170
Yeah.

3155
01:41:19,050 --> 01:41:20,230
I needed to shit.

3156
01:41:21,990 --> 01:41:24,390
He drank coffee before the stream, guys.

3157
01:41:25,010 --> 01:41:25,330
He did.

3158
01:41:26,390 --> 01:41:27,170
I stayed up from 2.

3159
01:41:27,170 --> 01:41:27,790
You still drinking?

3160
01:41:28,470 --> 01:41:28,990
No.

3161
01:41:29,150 --> 01:41:29,570
I'm good.

3162
01:41:29,730 --> 01:41:30,550
I'm drinking water.

3163
01:41:30,850 --> 01:41:31,270
Okay.

3164
01:41:35,370 --> 01:41:36,570
Yeah, he stayed.

3165
01:41:36,890 --> 01:41:38,830
He like, woke up the wrong time.

3166
01:41:38,970 --> 01:41:41,010
Even though I reminded him the time.

3167
01:41:42,070 --> 01:41:43,690
Like, and he saw my schedule.

3168
01:41:43,690 --> 01:41:46,190
And he still forgot the actual time.

3169
01:41:47,670 --> 01:41:48,150
Oh.

3170
01:41:48,250 --> 01:41:49,830
No, my game crashed!

3171
01:41:50,170 --> 01:41:50,430
No!

3172
01:41:50,770 --> 01:41:51,370
Oh, no.

3173
01:41:51,450 --> 01:41:52,110
Oh, no.

3174
01:41:52,250 --> 01:41:55,550
Oh my god.

3175
01:41:55,830 --> 01:41:57,090
Please keep me alive.

3176
01:41:57,330 --> 01:41:57,870
Keep me alive.

3177
01:41:58,010 --> 01:41:58,450
Yes, you can.

3178
01:41:58,550 --> 01:42:02,730
No, it's not that bad.

3179
01:42:03,030 --> 01:42:05,750
I swear it's not that bad.

3180
01:42:05,930 --> 01:42:07,690
I swear.

3181
01:42:08,610 --> 01:42:09,490
We'll be okay.

3182
01:42:09,690 --> 01:42:10,530
Am I dead?

3183
01:42:10,610 --> 01:42:10,910
Am I dead?

3184
01:42:11,490 --> 01:42:11,970
No.

3185
01:42:12,210 --> 01:42:12,590
Okay.

3186
01:42:12,870 --> 01:42:13,350
Okay.

3187
01:42:13,370 --> 01:42:13,670
Just keep going.

3188
01:42:13,690 --> 01:42:14,110
Keep guard.

3189
01:42:14,250 --> 01:42:16,270
They won't expect it because I'm standing still.

3190
01:42:16,410 --> 01:42:18,510
So it's like I'm part of the nature.

3191
01:42:18,510 --> 01:42:19,350
You're not gonna make any noises, right?

3192
01:42:19,490 --> 01:42:20,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3193
01:42:20,590 --> 01:42:21,130
I hear you.

3194
01:42:21,150 --> 01:42:21,530
I hear you.

3195
01:42:22,450 --> 01:42:23,890
It's part of the nature.

3196
01:42:25,390 --> 01:42:27,310
Okay, please tell me I'm still alive, Tangent.

3197
01:42:27,550 --> 01:42:27,950
You are.

3198
01:42:27,970 --> 01:42:28,170
You are.

3199
01:42:28,250 --> 01:42:28,570
Okay.

3200
01:42:29,530 --> 01:42:30,010
I'm in.

3201
01:42:31,770 --> 01:42:32,290
I'm in.

3202
01:42:33,250 --> 01:42:33,570
Whoa!

3203
01:42:34,030 --> 01:42:34,690
Oh my god.

3204
01:42:34,770 --> 01:42:35,530
I am safe.

3205
01:42:35,630 --> 01:42:36,650
Holy shit.

3206
01:42:36,670 --> 01:42:38,030
How did you get me all the way here?

3207
01:42:39,730 --> 01:42:40,890
There's a whole team inside of you.

3208
01:42:40,910 --> 01:42:41,070
Okay.

3209
01:42:42,070 --> 01:42:42,730
I'm coming over.

3210
01:42:43,690 --> 01:42:44,050
Don't worry.

3211
01:42:45,390 --> 01:42:47,190
Oh, maybe you worry a little bit.

3212
01:42:47,910 --> 01:42:48,830
Wait, there's another team!

3213
01:42:48,870 --> 01:42:49,430
Oh my god!

3214
01:42:49,630 --> 01:42:50,050
I'm dead.

3215
01:42:51,090 --> 01:42:52,110
There's already another team.

3216
01:42:52,270 --> 01:42:52,670
Look, man.

3217
01:42:53,190 --> 01:42:53,950
Look, man.

3218
01:42:53,970 --> 01:42:55,670
We're pretty much f'd.

3219
01:42:56,250 --> 01:42:56,930
Oh, no.

3220
01:42:56,990 --> 01:42:57,690
I'm still okay.

3221
01:42:58,010 --> 01:42:59,290
They're not gonna look here.

3222
01:43:00,330 --> 01:43:01,150
You're good, right?

3223
01:43:01,270 --> 01:43:01,950
Yeah, I'm good.

3224
01:43:03,410 --> 01:43:04,070
I'm good.

3225
01:43:05,030 --> 01:43:07,010
No, I'm not because there's two thieves.

3226
01:43:07,830 --> 01:43:08,570
I'm okay.

3227
01:43:10,270 --> 01:43:11,150
I'm okay.

3228
01:43:11,150 --> 01:43:11,510
I'm okay.

3229
01:43:11,530 --> 01:43:13,310
They're like on the wall right now.

3230
01:43:13,370 --> 01:43:13,910
On the roof.

3231
01:43:14,170 --> 01:43:15,990
I don't know.

3232
01:43:16,870 --> 01:43:19,190
See, I told you I'm okay.

3233
01:43:20,330 --> 01:43:22,210
Oh, you're so not okay, Tangent.

3234
01:43:22,490 --> 01:43:22,950
Oh, I'm dead.

3235
01:43:23,150 --> 01:43:24,450
You are so f'd.

3236
01:43:24,530 --> 01:43:25,090
Keep crawling.

3237
01:43:27,250 --> 01:43:28,350
You got this.

3238
01:43:28,530 --> 01:43:29,370
Yeah, I told you.

3239
01:43:29,490 --> 01:43:29,950
Keep crawling.

3240
01:43:32,530 --> 01:43:33,710
You'll be alright.

3241
01:43:33,990 --> 01:43:34,470
No.

3242
01:43:34,990 --> 01:43:35,470
No!

3243
01:43:35,830 --> 01:43:36,310
What?

3244
01:43:36,790 --> 01:43:37,810
Who are you?

3245
01:43:37,810 --> 01:43:38,270
You!

3246
01:43:38,930 --> 01:43:39,930
Give us smoke.

3247
01:43:40,070 --> 01:43:40,590
Give us smoke.

3248
01:43:40,630 --> 01:43:40,790
No.

3249
01:43:41,610 --> 01:43:43,590
Like, literally, I'm one hit.

3250
01:43:43,710 --> 01:43:44,470
Get out of here.

3251
01:43:44,570 --> 01:43:45,110
Get out of here.

3252
01:43:45,310 --> 01:43:45,830
Okay.

3253
01:43:47,390 --> 01:43:48,230
I have ult.

3254
01:43:49,990 --> 01:43:52,890
What the f'k are these people?

3255
01:43:53,990 --> 01:43:55,730
Oh, my God.

3256
01:43:56,850 --> 01:44:00,110
Where did these guys come from?

3257
01:44:00,430 --> 01:44:00,970
Where did these guys come from?

3258
01:44:00,970 --> 01:44:01,250
Okay.

3259
01:44:01,430 --> 01:44:02,930
It's definitely not okay.

3260
01:44:03,010 --> 01:44:04,870
I was not okay.

3261
01:44:05,910 --> 01:44:07,570
How did your game go?

3262
01:44:08,110 --> 01:44:08,930
I don't know.

3263
01:44:08,970 --> 01:44:10,730
I got like some weird error code.

3264
01:44:11,030 --> 01:44:12,370
I didn't even read it fully.

3265
01:44:12,470 --> 01:44:14,390
Because I was like, what the f'k is this error code?

3266
01:44:15,570 --> 01:44:16,890
It's the weirdest sh'it.

3267
01:44:16,990 --> 01:44:17,230
Okay.

3268
01:44:17,290 --> 01:44:19,810
There was like four f'ing teams here.

3269
01:44:20,150 --> 01:44:21,210
There was so...

3270
01:44:21,210 --> 01:44:21,850
Oh, my God.

3271
01:44:22,030 --> 01:44:22,750
There is like four...

3272
01:44:22,750 --> 01:44:22,990
It's okay.

3273
01:44:23,030 --> 01:44:23,970
The guy that killed me died.

3274
01:44:24,150 --> 01:44:24,890
That's all that matters.

3275
01:44:25,450 --> 01:44:26,630
They don't deserve it.

3276
01:44:27,050 --> 01:44:27,850
I hope...

3277
01:44:27,850 --> 01:44:30,790
They don't deserve anything.

3278
01:44:32,030 --> 01:44:32,830
Paid actor.

3279
01:44:32,990 --> 01:44:35,110
Oh, my God.

3280
01:44:35,150 --> 01:44:36,770
Literally came out of f'ing nowhere.

3281
01:44:38,110 --> 01:44:39,810
What is that Horizon doing?

3282
01:44:39,930 --> 01:44:40,650
Or Talos?

3283
01:44:41,230 --> 01:44:43,230
What is happening with this team?

3284
01:44:43,710 --> 01:44:44,490
The hell?

3285
01:44:46,850 --> 01:44:48,690
I thought you were gonna focus up.

3286
01:44:48,790 --> 01:44:49,250
What happened?

3287
01:44:51,310 --> 01:44:52,290
You crashed?

3288
01:44:53,130 --> 01:44:53,650
Okay.

3289
01:44:53,710 --> 01:44:55,930
I crashed, but I was still alive.

3290
01:44:56,210 --> 01:44:58,030
I wanted to push someone.

3291
01:44:59,410 --> 01:45:00,650
And then my game crashed.

3292
01:45:00,870 --> 01:45:01,330
Wait.

3293
01:45:01,690 --> 01:45:02,750
You were crashed too?

3294
01:45:03,090 --> 01:45:03,610
No.

3295
01:45:03,670 --> 01:45:04,510
I'm good.

3296
01:45:04,810 --> 01:45:05,390
I'm good.

3297
01:45:05,390 --> 01:45:05,490
I'm good.

3298
01:45:05,510 --> 01:45:05,750
I'm good.

3299
01:45:06,030 --> 01:45:11,730
I was gonna say.

3300
01:45:15,310 --> 01:45:15,890
I was gonna say.

3301
01:45:19,630 --> 01:45:20,510
This time.

3302
01:45:21,930 --> 01:45:22,810
This time.

3303
01:45:22,930 --> 01:45:23,230
Surely.

3304
01:45:24,130 --> 01:45:24,570
Surely.

3305
01:45:26,830 --> 01:45:27,570
There's no way.

3306
01:45:29,530 --> 01:45:30,650
There's no f'ing way.

3307
01:45:31,990 --> 01:45:33,210
I just slapped myself.

3308
01:45:34,370 --> 01:45:35,330
If we lose...

3309
01:45:35,330 --> 01:45:35,910
I don't know why, but hey.

3310
01:45:35,910 --> 01:45:38,030
If we don't win this next game...

3311
01:45:38,030 --> 01:45:38,690
Stay on me.

3312
01:45:38,790 --> 01:45:39,410
I'm the champion.

3313
01:45:39,470 --> 01:45:40,810
I'll superchat Tenjin.

3314
01:45:41,250 --> 01:45:41,690
Wait.

3315
01:45:41,770 --> 01:45:41,890
No.

3316
01:45:41,890 --> 01:45:42,690
Because then you wanna lose.

3317
01:45:43,870 --> 01:45:44,310
No.

3318
01:45:44,310 --> 01:45:45,270
I won't.

3319
01:45:46,490 --> 01:45:47,170
I won't.

3320
01:45:47,170 --> 01:45:47,570
Trust.

3321
01:45:47,570 --> 01:45:48,290
If we win this game...

3322
01:45:49,710 --> 01:45:51,070
I'll superchat Tenjin.

3323
01:45:52,370 --> 01:45:52,810
What?

3324
01:45:54,510 --> 01:45:54,950
What?

3325
01:45:56,910 --> 01:45:57,350
What?

3326
01:45:58,030 --> 01:45:58,470
Nah.

3327
01:46:00,450 --> 01:46:00,890
Nah.

3328
01:46:00,950 --> 01:46:01,830
You can't do this to me.

3329
01:46:02,850 --> 01:46:04,250
Why are you giving me pressure?

3330
01:46:04,250 --> 01:46:05,630
And expectations.

3331
01:46:05,950 --> 01:46:07,530
Which I never really had.

3332
01:46:07,790 --> 01:46:09,710
I can do something really f'ed up.

3333
01:46:09,890 --> 01:46:11,370
I can be like...

3334
01:46:12,130 --> 01:46:14,090
The superchat starts at 500...

3335
01:46:14,090 --> 01:46:14,630
Not 500.

3336
01:46:14,710 --> 01:46:14,950
100.

3337
01:46:15,310 --> 01:46:18,150
And then every loss, it loses $10.

3338
01:46:18,970 --> 01:46:19,570
What?

3339
01:46:19,970 --> 01:46:21,150
Who are you?

3340
01:46:21,190 --> 01:46:21,890
Mr. Beast?

3341
01:46:22,890 --> 01:46:24,510
You Mr. Beast era?

3342
01:46:28,110 --> 01:46:29,630
We double or nothing.

3343
01:46:30,630 --> 01:46:32,550
But instead of giving money...

3344
01:46:32,550 --> 01:46:33,550
I take it away.

3345
01:46:36,810 --> 01:46:37,570
Where are they?

3346
01:46:38,170 --> 01:46:39,270
They're in this building.

3347
01:46:39,530 --> 01:46:39,930
Oh.

3348
01:46:39,930 --> 01:46:40,310
I see them.

3349
01:46:43,010 --> 01:46:43,810
Oh shit.

3350
01:46:43,990 --> 01:46:44,690
Oh my god.

3351
01:46:44,770 --> 01:46:44,930
Wait.

3352
01:46:45,010 --> 01:46:45,630
I got shot by a...

3353
01:46:45,630 --> 01:46:47,810
Good luck Tenjin.

3354
01:46:49,450 --> 01:46:50,410
Mr. Beast.

3355
01:46:51,190 --> 01:46:51,590
Tenjin.

3356
01:46:51,670 --> 01:46:52,110
Good luck.

3357
01:47:03,250 --> 01:47:03,650
Tenjin.

3358
01:47:03,770 --> 01:47:04,230
Think about it.

3359
01:47:04,250 --> 01:47:04,690
Think about the money.

3360
01:47:05,090 --> 01:47:05,530
Yeah.

3361
01:47:05,810 --> 01:47:07,110
He's rising in front of you.

3362
01:47:16,520 --> 01:47:16,960
Okay.

3363
01:47:17,080 --> 01:47:17,840
But now you have to win.

3364
01:47:17,900 --> 01:47:19,200
We have to win this as a duo now.

3365
01:47:21,540 --> 01:47:21,980
What?

3366
01:47:23,540 --> 01:47:23,980
No.

3367
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:24,700
It's still 100.

3368
01:47:24,980 --> 01:47:25,860
It's still one akka.

3369
01:47:27,800 --> 01:47:30,280
Where are the Doki Beast funds?

3370
01:47:32,160 --> 01:47:33,580
Doki Beast funds.

3371
01:47:34,580 --> 01:47:36,720
I like how someone's like throwing to pay less.

3372
01:47:37,940 --> 01:47:39,120
That wasn't throwing.

3373
01:47:39,120 --> 01:47:40,260
They're just throwing in the...

3374
01:47:40,700 --> 01:47:41,560
He's throwing in a pot.

3375
01:47:44,440 --> 01:47:47,340
I didn't expect to get shot by three fucking people.

3376
01:47:49,480 --> 01:47:50,700
Like what the fuck?

3377
01:47:50,740 --> 01:47:52,020
How do you expect me to live?

3378
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:55,360
I was like what the fuck?

3379
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:57,220
I mean I don't even know what our teammate was doing.

3380
01:47:57,500 --> 01:47:58,440
Honestly it's true.

3381
01:47:58,620 --> 01:47:59,460
I don't know either.

3382
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:02,080
Like they just waited there.

3383
01:48:02,100 --> 01:48:02,460
Oh okay.

3384
01:48:02,540 --> 01:48:03,220
Oh I like it.

3385
01:48:03,320 --> 01:48:05,120
Every kill gets $10.

3386
01:48:06,260 --> 01:48:07,160
Assists don't count.

3387
01:48:08,900 --> 01:48:09,800
Someone's flying here.

3388
01:48:10,700 --> 01:48:11,080
Let's go.

3389
01:48:11,200 --> 01:48:11,920
Oh shit.

3390
01:48:13,540 --> 01:48:14,180
Already?

3391
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:17,560
Oh he's serious now.

3392
01:48:19,320 --> 01:48:20,220
Lifeline's on you.

3393
01:48:20,380 --> 01:48:21,940
Oh my god.

3394
01:48:26,020 --> 01:48:27,080
No he's one.

3395
01:48:30,340 --> 01:48:31,480
Oh he's resing.

3396
01:48:32,120 --> 01:48:32,960
Below you.

3397
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:35,700
Yeah well I can't do anything can I?

3398
01:48:35,900 --> 01:48:37,360
Oh no.

3399
01:48:37,360 --> 01:48:37,740
No.

3400
01:48:39,500 --> 01:48:41,220
Pension I think you should just leave.

3401
01:48:42,240 --> 01:48:43,340
I don't know man.

3402
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:50,040
Oh.

3403
01:48:51,960 --> 01:48:52,480
Oh.

3404
01:48:53,060 --> 01:48:54,180
He's running out.

3405
01:48:54,860 --> 01:48:55,700
Over here on me.

3406
01:48:57,180 --> 01:48:59,080
What the fuck is wrong with you?

3407
01:49:00,120 --> 01:49:00,920
The heck?

3408
01:49:01,220 --> 01:49:01,660
Alright.

3409
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:02,840

Okay.

3414
01:49:12,440 --> 01:49:12,940

Damn.

01:50:59,080 --> 01:51:01,220
You're stealing it from a fellow.

3471
01:51:01,460 --> 01:51:01,940
A fellow.

3472
01:51:03,120 --> 01:51:03,520

First you steal my money.

3475
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:08,760
And I never had rights to begin with.

3476
01:51:09,540 --> 01:51:12,940
That was my one way ticket to having rights man.

3477
01:51:13,020 --> 01:51:13,680
How dare you.

3478
01:51:14,100 --> 01:51:14,620

Bro took the rights.

He's like if I can't be on your team.

3484

3485
01:51:31,080 --> 01:51:31,420

Hell.

3487
01:51:33,860 --> 01:51:36,180
Bro is praying for my downfall.

3488
01:51:36,740 --> 01:51:38,260
I'm gonna check out the map room.

3489

Wait there's people here.

Wait is there?

3491
01:51:41,720 --> 01:51:42,820
No I was lying.

3492
01:51:43,740 --> 01:51:46,160
We could scan the radar.

3493
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:47,020
Yeah I was lying.

3494
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:50,460
I was just paranoid.

3495
01:51:50,860 --> 01:51:51,560
That's it.

3496
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:54,240
See I'm gonna grab.

Oh no I'm seeing things.

3499
01:51:57,160 --> 01:51:57,920
Oh.

3500
01:52:02,100 --> 01:52:03,460
I'm not even here.

3501
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:05,820
I've been.

3502
01:52:05,820 --> 01:52:07,160
This has been the solo stream.

3503
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:08,460
I actually.

3504
01:52:08,540 --> 01:52:10,260
Tengiz my secret account.

3505
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:12,680
Imaginary friend.

3506
01:52:12,940 --> 01:52:15,120
Someone scanned us just now.

3507
01:52:15,260 --> 01:52:15,660
They're here.

3508
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:18,140
Don't worry I'm serious now.

3509
01:52:20,600 --> 01:52:22,520
They know I'm literally right here.

3510
01:52:23,460 --> 01:52:24,280
Got one.

3511
01:52:25,240 --> 01:52:26,160
Oh shit.

3512
01:52:26,360 --> 01:52:27,100
Oh shit.

3513
01:52:27,160 --> 01:52:28,800
Wow ever since I gave him an incentive.

3514
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:30,100
He's actually killing everybody.

3515
01:52:30,660 --> 01:52:31,980
That's actually crazy.

3516
01:52:34,040 --> 01:52:35,200
Where is his teammate?

3517
01:52:36,720 --> 01:52:37,940
Did you get another one?

3518
01:52:38,260 --> 01:52:39,300
Oh my god.

3519
01:52:39,740 --> 01:52:40,380
Oh he's behind.

3520
01:52:40,560 --> 01:52:41,720
Let him rez.

3521
01:52:43,240 --> 01:52:44,360
Wait where?

3522
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:50,260
Okay he doesn't rez me.

3523
01:52:50,380 --> 01:52:51,620
I don't know where he's going.

3524
01:52:53,180 --> 01:52:53,920
It's fine.

3525
01:52:54,080 --> 01:52:54,860
He's almost dead.

3526
01:52:57,160 --> 01:52:57,420
He's not rezzing you?

3527
01:52:58,460 --> 01:52:58,900
No.

3528
01:52:59,080 --> 01:53:00,460
There's a $10 for you.

3529
01:53:01,660 --> 01:53:02,100
There.

3530
01:53:05,160 --> 01:53:06,400
Oh he's a YouTuber.

3531
01:53:06,720 --> 01:53:07,900

We should take the clips away from him.

3537
01:53:17,460 --> 01:53:18,540
He doesn't deserve it.

3538
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:22,620
Yeah we're also growing streamers.

3539
01:53:22,620 --> 01:53:23,300

From 10 to his balance?

3588
01:55:03,880 --> 01:55:05,060

3592
01:55:09,960 --> 01:55:11,080
No cause he'll do it for free.

3593
01:55:11,080 --> 01:55:11,400
I'm chilling.

3594
01:55:11,680 --> 01:55:15,420
He doesn't need the $10.

3595
01:55:15,680 --> 01:55:17,220
He'll do it for free.

3596
01:55:18,940 --> 01:55:19,780

He didn't even want it.

3601
01:55:28,860 --> 01:55:30,400
He had no purpose.

3602
01:55:31,400 --> 01:55:32,360
No reason.

3603
01:55:32,580 --> 01:55:34,400
No reason to be there.

3604
01:55:35,900 --> 01:55:37,540
Oh he's not in the game.

3605
01:55:37,900 --> 01:55:39,140
No he's not in the game.

3606
01:55:39,180 --> 01:55:41,040
If he was he'd be ready.

3607
01:55:41,100 --> 01:55:42,260
He probably would.

3608
01:55:43,460 --> 01:55:44,380
I could tell.

3609
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:47,500

That's a whole lot.

3629
01:56:20,900 --> 01:56:22,280

3638
01:56:39,080 --> 01:56:40,200
Wait really?

3639

01:57:29,140 --> 01:57:29,540
I mean that's Asia in general though.

3664

Is that just Asia?

3665
01:57:32,620 --> 01:57:33,720
They don't see us.

3666
01:57:34,760 --> 01:57:36,140
Okay now they might know.

3667
01:57:38,400 --> 01:57:39,720

Okay.

3675
01:57:51,120 --> 01:57:52,140

Holy shit that guy's a baby.

There's no way.

01:58:05,540 --> 01:58:07,460
Oh my god we actually killed a child.

3684
01:58:08,360 --> 01:58:09,120

Yeah yeah in the game.

3693
01:58:22,220 --> 01:58:23,900
We don't want a repeat.

Okay but did you see that bloodhound?

3695
01:58:28,760 --> 01:58:29,740
He was so confused.

Where did he go?

3703
01:58:43,800 --> 01:58:44,400
Oh there he is.

Knocked him.

01:59:13,620 --> 01:59:14,440
I'm bailing.

3718
01:59:14,440 --> 01:59:14,700
I'm bailing.

3719
01:59:15,280 --> 01:59:16,140
Where's the other?

3720
01:59:16,300 --> 01:59:17,520
Where's his teammate then?

3721
01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:18,260
Shit!

3722
01:59:19,940 --> 01:59:20,720
They're scared.

3723
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:23,780
Wait I hear him.

3724
01:59:23,880 --> 01:59:24,460
To my left.

3725
01:59:24,660 --> 01:59:25,040
Yeah yeah yeah.

3726
01:59:25,040 --> 01:59:25,820
He's in here.

3727
01:59:25,920 --> 01:59:26,220
He's in there.

3728
01:59:26,640 --> 01:59:27,460
He went inside.

3729
01:59:30,220 --> 01:59:31,140
I didn't get him.

3730
01:59:32,980 --> 01:59:34,100
I'm just gonna loot this.

3731
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:34,620
Woah!

3732
01:59:37,080 --> 01:59:37,800
Red armor?

3733
01:59:39,080 --> 01:59:39,780
I'm gonna...

3734
01:59:39,780 --> 01:59:40,400
bat?

3735
01:59:42,240 --> 01:59:43,260
Don't worry I got you.

3736
01:59:44,580 --> 01:59:45,060
I'm gonna...

3737
01:59:45,820 --> 01:59:46,220
Nice!

3738
01:59:49,480 --> 01:59:50,360
They have to come to us.

3739
01:59:50,380 --> 01:59:51,480
This team has to come to us.

3740
01:59:51,980 --> 01:59:52,420
Hold on.

3741
01:59:52,700 --> 01:59:55,180
Four seconds.

3742
01:59:55,820 --> 01:59:56,740
Oh man they're...

3743
01:59:56,740 --> 01:59:57,640
Yeah they're rolling down.

3744
01:59:57,700 --> 01:59:58,060
They're rolling down.

3745
01:59:58,200 --> 01:59:58,560
I'm watching.

3746
01:59:58,820 --> 01:59:59,340
You alright?

3747
02:00:04,640 --> 02:00:05,500
I'm just holding them.

3748
02:00:06,700 --> 02:00:07,300
Where they at?

3749
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:09,580
My ping.

3750
02:00:09,720 --> 02:00:10,140
My ping.

3751
02:00:10,180 --> 02:00:10,600
My ping.

3752
02:00:12,140 --> 02:00:12,660
On me?

3753
02:00:13,900 --> 02:00:14,680
Behind this rock?

3754
02:00:14,880 --> 02:00:15,200
Yeah.

3755
02:00:17,360 --> 02:00:17,760
Wait.

3756
02:00:18,080 --> 02:00:18,800
That's like a solo.

3757
02:00:19,040 --> 02:00:19,520
Hiding.

3758
02:00:22,300 --> 02:00:23,720
There's a solo right there.

3759
02:00:27,480 --> 02:00:27,960
Yeah!

3760
02:00:29,040 --> 02:00:30,200
No no no no no!

3761
02:00:30,680 --> 02:00:31,160
No!

3762
02:00:33,260 --> 02:00:34,800
Wait that's not even a solo!

3763
02:00:37,540 --> 02:00:38,920
You want that.

3764
02:00:39,120 --> 02:00:39,740
You want that.

3765
02:00:40,680 --> 02:00:41,700
Wait where did he go?

3766
02:00:41,860 --> 02:00:42,620
Did someone rotate this?

3767
02:00:42,820 --> 02:00:43,360
Yeah he did.

3768
02:00:43,620 --> 02:00:44,040
No way.

3769
02:00:45,160 --> 02:00:46,120
No way!

3770
02:00:46,340 --> 02:00:47,320
No kill for you!

3771
02:00:47,740 --> 02:00:49,720
No way they rotated that.

3772
02:00:50,620 --> 02:00:51,660
That's crazy.

3773
02:00:52,080 --> 02:00:53,500
What the fuck!

3774
02:00:54,920 --> 02:00:55,440
Alright.

3775
02:00:55,620 --> 02:00:56,800
One last team.

3776
02:01:01,160 --> 02:01:02,860
One last team huh?

3777
02:01:03,260 --> 02:01:05,220
Wouldn't it be funny if that one team killed us?

3778
02:01:07,740 --> 02:01:09,040
That would be so funny.

3779
02:01:09,540 --> 02:01:11,540
Tenzin it would be so fucking funny.

3780
02:01:11,620 --> 02:01:11,940
You know it.

3781
02:01:16,240 --> 02:01:16,760
Wait.

3782
02:01:16,820 --> 02:01:17,340
That's open.

3783
02:01:17,980 --> 02:01:18,500
Yeah.

3784
02:01:18,620 --> 02:01:19,500
Friggin shot by it.

3785
02:01:19,740 --> 02:01:21,020
Oh my god!

3786
02:01:21,680 --> 02:01:24,020
Would it be funny if I just throw that right now?

3787
02:01:27,380 --> 02:01:28,440
Oh, it's over there.

3788
02:01:33,760 --> 02:01:35,520
Woah, where am I getting shot from?

3789
02:01:35,580 --> 02:01:35,960
I swear.

3790
02:01:36,920 --> 02:01:37,980
What are you doing something stupid?

3791
02:01:37,980 --> 02:01:39,480
It's like they're hitting me mid-airs.

3792
02:01:42,760 --> 02:01:44,080
Oh wait, what the fuck?

3793
02:01:44,340 --> 02:01:45,320
I knocked one.

3794
02:01:49,010 --> 02:01:49,770
Where's his teammate?

3795
02:01:56,570 --> 02:01:58,110
Wait, his teammate's so far.

3796
02:01:58,370 --> 02:02:00,570
They made a nexus.

3797
02:02:00,930 --> 02:02:01,550
Oh!

3798
02:02:02,570 --> 02:02:03,410
That's dumb.

3799
02:02:05,530 --> 02:02:07,310
Tengen, the last kill!

3800
02:02:07,890 --> 02:02:08,530
Tengen!

3801
02:02:09,710 --> 02:02:10,350
Tengen!

3802
02:02:13,610 --> 02:02:16,430
Man, they went by a nexus?

3803
02:02:16,710 --> 02:02:17,290
That's annoying.

3804
02:02:18,090 --> 02:02:20,990
Holy shit, they made a nexus to go back.

3805
02:02:23,090 --> 02:02:24,790
Unlucky Tengen, you had...

3806
02:02:26,330 --> 02:02:26,810
Unlucky.

3807
02:02:28,950 --> 02:02:29,830
That's crazy.

3808
02:02:31,710 --> 02:02:33,230
But you got that... you got...

3809
02:02:33,230 --> 02:02:34,690
Okay, but you didn't get other kills.

3810
02:02:34,870 --> 02:02:36,370
Okay, that was 90 for the win.

3811
02:02:37,310 --> 02:02:38,570
And... how much?

3812
02:02:39,150 --> 02:02:39,850
How much?

3813
02:02:39,950 --> 02:02:41,330
Woah, you got 7 kills?

3814
02:02:42,550 --> 02:02:43,350
Bro, Red Sea.

3815
02:02:43,590 --> 02:02:45,490
Red Sea, delete your YouTube channel, Red Sea.

3816
02:02:49,950 --> 02:02:50,730
That's 160!

3817
02:02:50,730 --> 02:02:51,150
160!

3818
02:02:53,330 --> 02:02:53,770
What?

3819
02:02:54,370 --> 02:02:55,950
Yeah, the 90 on top.

3820
02:02:56,170 --> 02:02:57,310
Also, Red Sea, I'm joking.

3821
02:02:57,410 --> 02:02:58,410
Don't delete your YouTube channel.

3822
02:02:58,810 --> 02:02:59,270
But like...

3823
02:02:59,270 --> 02:03:02,370
But like... bro, it's a little embarrassing, bro.

3824
02:03:06,690 --> 02:03:07,570
A win?

3825
02:03:08,170 --> 02:03:09,370
Yeah, you got a win!

3826
02:03:10,910 --> 02:03:11,790
A win?

3827
02:03:11,790 --> 02:03:12,310
No way.

3828
02:03:12,310 --> 02:03:12,570
You did it!

3829
02:03:13,970 --> 02:03:14,890
How do you feel?

3830
02:03:16,190 --> 02:03:17,290
I can buy more cigarettes.

3831
02:03:19,830 --> 02:03:20,710
How do you feel?

3832
02:03:22,070 --> 02:03:23,030
I'm kidding.

3833
02:03:23,430 --> 02:03:24,310
I'm kidding.

3834
02:03:24,910 --> 02:03:26,050
I'm joking.

3835
02:03:26,090 --> 02:03:27,010
Holy shit.

3836
02:03:27,170 --> 02:03:28,930
I have pocket money, bro.

3837
02:03:29,190 --> 02:03:29,650
That's...

3838
02:03:29,650 --> 02:03:29,930
That's...

3839
02:03:29,930 --> 02:03:31,530
God, see...

3840
02:03:33,110 --> 02:03:34,810
I swear to God.

3841
02:03:34,970 --> 02:03:35,170
No, dude.

3842
02:03:39,630 --> 02:03:42,170
I swear to fucking God, man.

3843
02:03:42,470 --> 02:03:44,810
I swear to God.

3844
02:03:45,290 --> 02:03:45,890
Okay.

3845
02:03:45,950 --> 02:03:46,230
What?

3846
02:03:47,290 --> 02:03:48,430
Oh yeah, I forgot.

3847
02:03:49,710 --> 02:03:50,690
It's not a cigarette.

3848
02:03:50,690 --> 02:03:51,630
I forgot.

3849
02:03:51,730 --> 02:03:52,930
I'm not using Super Chat.

3850
02:03:55,610 --> 02:03:56,790
We don't want...

3851
02:03:56,790 --> 02:03:56,890
You forgot.

3852
02:03:57,050 --> 02:03:59,670
YouTube should not be taking this cut.

3853
02:04:00,510 --> 02:04:01,070
No!

3854
02:04:01,790 --> 02:04:03,530
Oh yeah, YouTube takes a cut.

3855
02:04:03,610 --> 02:04:04,410
I forgot about that.

3856
02:04:04,450 --> 02:04:04,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3857
02:04:04,650 --> 02:04:05,570
Holy shit.

3858
02:04:05,790 --> 02:04:07,170
That's why I was like...

3859
02:04:07,170 --> 02:04:07,630
That is so true.

3860
02:04:07,630 --> 02:04:10,290
You're not taking attention cigarette money.

3861
02:04:10,550 --> 02:04:11,190
You're not...

3862
02:04:11,190 --> 02:04:12,090
I can't...

3863
02:04:13,530 --> 02:04:14,390
Oh, man.

3864
02:04:15,890 --> 02:04:17,710
See, that's not so hard.

3865
02:04:19,530 --> 02:04:19,930
Nah.

3866
02:04:19,930 --> 02:04:21,190
It's not so...

3867
02:04:21,190 --> 02:04:21,490
It's an easy game.

3868
02:04:21,650 --> 02:04:22,530
See, look at that.

3869
02:04:23,010 --> 02:04:28,690
Like, if you... I think if you didn't get Streams Night by your friend, you could have won the last game.

3870
02:04:28,750 --> 02:04:29,930
I think 100%.

3871
02:04:31,890 --> 02:04:32,770
Not really.

3872
02:04:33,030 --> 02:04:34,750
There's two... Oh, no.

3873
02:04:34,870 --> 02:04:35,590
There you go.

3874
02:04:37,130 --> 02:04:37,570
Easy.

3875
02:04:38,290 --> 02:04:39,010
Uh-huh.

3876
02:04:40,110 --> 02:04:41,170
Yeah, look, that's me!

3877
02:04:41,990 --> 02:04:43,370
Not cigarette money.

3878
02:04:43,850 --> 02:04:44,470
That's me.

3879
02:04:45,070 --> 02:04:45,790
It could be.

3880
02:04:45,790 --> 02:04:46,230
Thanks for the...

3881
02:04:46,230 --> 02:04:47,490
It could be a cigarette money.

3882
02:04:47,490 --> 02:04:48,890
Thanks for the... Thanks for the boost, man.

3883
02:04:53,760 --> 02:04:56,020
You know how they're like, here's my PayPal.

3884
02:04:59,060 --> 02:05:00,960
Even though I did more damage there.

3885
02:05:02,200 --> 02:05:02,680
Wow.

3886
02:05:02,680 --> 02:05:04,180
Thank you, Doki Beast.

3887
02:05:05,400 --> 02:05:06,260
Oh, my God.

3888
02:05:06,640 --> 02:05:08,960
I'm surprised you didn't double or nothing.

3889
02:05:09,020 --> 02:05:10,020
Give it to the next guy.

3890
02:05:10,660 --> 02:05:12,580
Give it to the next guy?

3891
02:05:12,840 --> 02:05:13,680
Nah, nah, nah.

3892
02:05:14,020 --> 02:05:16,140
If I have some fuel left, maybe...

3893
02:05:16,140 --> 02:05:17,020
Doki Beast.

3894
02:05:17,180 --> 02:05:19,000
Doki Beast is here.

3895
02:05:19,280 --> 02:05:20,260
Don't worry, guys.

3896
02:05:20,960 --> 02:05:25,360
Oh, you wanna be my... Who are the... Who is like that... The Mr. Beast people?

3897
02:05:25,880 --> 02:05:29,840
Like, the guy that's always sticking around with Mr. Beast?

3898
02:05:32,180 --> 02:05:33,080
His gang.

3899
02:05:33,080 --> 02:05:33,780
Yeah, his gang.

3900
02:05:33,820 --> 02:05:34,320
Who is this?

3901
02:05:34,440 --> 02:05:35,660
Are you like my shadow?

3902
02:05:36,360 --> 02:05:38,700
Why is there a gif in the middle?

3903
02:05:38,860 --> 02:05:40,040
What the fu... Oh, my God.

3904
02:05:40,120 --> 02:05:40,580
I see.

3905
02:05:40,860 --> 02:05:42,660
What is there... Oh, so what?

3906
02:05:43,080 --> 02:05:45,040
Why is she that funny?

3907
02:05:45,220 --> 02:05:47,220
I was like, why is there a gif?

3908
02:05:47,260 --> 02:05:49,860
A single gif in the middle?

3909
02:05:50,260 --> 02:05:51,500
The Indonesian flag.

3910
02:05:53,260 --> 02:05:57,200
Yeah, you wanna be my... You can be my... Do you wanna be my Carl or Chandler?

3911
02:05:57,360 --> 02:05:57,540
Yeah.

3912
02:05:57,860 --> 02:05:58,260
Who do you wanna be?

3913
02:05:58,260 --> 02:05:59,280
I can be your Chandler.

3914
02:05:59,360 --> 02:06:00,180
You wanna be my Chandler?

3915
02:06:00,240 --> 02:06:00,620
Okay.

3916
02:06:00,860 --> 02:06:01,260
Okay.

3917
02:06:01,280 --> 02:06:03,880
This is Chandler Tengen.

3918
02:06:07,260 --> 02:06:08,220
Oh, my God.

3919
02:06:08,260 --> 02:06:08,580
Don't worry.

3920
02:06:08,680 --> 02:06:11,320
I'm gonna be the VTuber Mr. Beast here.

3921
02:06:14,560 --> 02:06:15,100
GG's, man.

3922
02:06:15,380 --> 02:06:16,540
I had a great time, though.

3923
02:06:16,620 --> 02:06:17,000
GG's.

3924
02:06:17,120 --> 02:06:17,520
GG's.

3925
02:06:17,540 --> 02:06:18,020
We're gonna...

3926
02:06:18,020 --> 02:06:18,280
Yes.

3927
02:06:20,260 --> 02:06:21,600
I played Defiant next week.

3928
02:06:22,740 --> 02:06:23,100
Yeah.

3929
02:06:23,180 --> 02:06:23,980
That's my ex-Defiant.

3930
02:06:24,160 --> 02:06:25,940
Yeah, ex-Defiant next week.

3931
02:06:26,020 --> 02:06:26,820
We're going to... guys, next week...

3932
02:06:26,820 --> 02:06:27,840
Gather people if you want.

3933
02:06:27,960 --> 02:06:28,580
Oh, hell yeah.

3934
02:06:28,620 --> 02:06:29,080
Let's do it.

3935
02:06:29,180 --> 02:06:29,400
Wait.

3936
02:06:29,900 --> 02:06:31,020
How many people do we need?

3937
02:06:32,140 --> 02:06:32,860
I'm not sure.

3938
02:06:32,920 --> 02:06:34,180
How much is a full party for?

3939
02:06:34,240 --> 02:06:34,960
I don't fucking know.

3940
02:06:34,960 --> 02:06:36,280
I haven't touched that game yet.

3941
02:06:36,860 --> 02:06:37,600
I'll ask around.

3942
02:06:39,240 --> 02:06:39,680
All right.

3943
02:06:39,680 --> 02:06:40,300
Yeah, I'm down.

3944
02:06:40,500 --> 02:06:40,940
I'm down.

3945
02:06:41,640 --> 02:06:42,180
GG's, man.

3946
02:06:42,280 --> 02:06:44,180
I have a try-hard friend there for some reason.

3947
02:06:44,820 --> 02:06:45,320
Oh, yeah.

3948
02:06:45,400 --> 02:06:46,260
People are gonna be so...

3949
02:06:46,260 --> 02:06:46,660
Kaz.

3950
02:06:47,960 --> 02:06:50,020
Kaz is my brother's name.

3951
02:06:50,200 --> 02:06:53,900
I swear if that's actually my little brother donating...

3952
02:06:54,320 --> 02:06:55,160
Oh, no, no.

3953
02:06:55,160 --> 02:06:55,680
That's a...

3954
02:06:55,680 --> 02:06:56,120
What the fuck is he doing?

3955
02:06:56,660 --> 02:06:58,040
What the fuck is he doing?

3956
02:06:58,460 --> 02:06:59,220
That's a dragoon.

3957
02:06:59,220 --> 02:06:59,480
That's a dragoon.

3958
02:06:59,480 --> 02:07:00,120
That's a dragoon.

3959
02:07:00,200 --> 02:07:02,520
Kaz is my little bro's name, by the way.

3960
02:07:02,520 --> 02:07:02,640
Oh, my God.

3961
02:07:02,680 --> 02:07:03,240
Kaz.

3962
02:07:03,260 --> 02:07:05,920
You're secretly his little brother?

3963
02:07:06,740 --> 02:07:08,240
I didn't realize that.

3964
02:07:10,340 --> 02:07:11,540
Who would have thought?

3965
02:07:11,560 --> 02:07:11,700
Oh, my God.

3966
02:07:11,980 --> 02:07:13,440
I can't believe it.

3967
02:07:13,560 --> 02:07:14,660
Kaz was secretly...

3968
02:07:15,360 --> 02:07:15,920
Kaz?

3969
02:07:15,920 --> 02:07:17,420
...sincerely the little brother.

3970
02:07:17,420 --> 02:07:17,820
The little dragoon?

3971
02:07:18,740 --> 02:07:19,580
Yeah, of course.

3972
02:07:19,820 --> 02:07:20,160
No way.

3973
02:07:20,200 --> 02:07:20,660
That's...

3974
02:07:20,660 --> 02:07:23,320
You know the allowance you gave your little brother?

3975
02:07:23,520 --> 02:07:24,720
It all went back to me.

3976
02:07:24,920 --> 02:07:26,780
I see.

3977
02:07:27,340 --> 02:07:27,880
I see.

3978
02:07:27,880 --> 02:07:29,440
That's why I'm giving it back.

3979
02:07:29,620 --> 02:07:31,460
Giving it back all the time.

3980
02:07:32,080 --> 02:07:33,460
This whole time.

3981
02:07:33,780 --> 02:07:34,860
No way.

3982
02:07:35,380 --> 02:07:36,440
Yeah, damn right.

3983
02:07:38,880 --> 02:07:40,040
Oh, bless you.

3984
02:07:40,640 --> 02:07:41,360
GG's, though.

3985
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:42,360
Have a great time.

3986
02:07:42,380 --> 02:07:42,880
GG's.

3987
02:07:47,500 --> 02:07:48,060
GG's.

3988
02:07:48,160 --> 02:07:50,480
I'm gonna go talk to my dragoons now.

3989
02:07:50,540 --> 02:07:55,520
Hope you guys enjoyed us playing together for the very first time on stream.

3990
02:07:57,340 --> 02:07:58,760
For the very first time.

3991
02:07:58,860 --> 02:07:59,940
Yeah, very first time.

3992
02:07:59,940 --> 02:08:00,500
Once again, very first time.

3993
02:08:00,600 --> 02:08:01,980
We haven't met until...

3994
02:08:01,980 --> 02:08:02,260
I had a very good impression.

3995
02:08:02,720 --> 02:08:03,280
Yeah.

3996
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:05,280
Very good impression.

3997
02:08:05,600 --> 02:08:05,980
Yeah.

3998
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:07,620
It's not like I...

3999
02:08:07,620 --> 02:08:13,080
I found this person on, like, Fiverr to make me...

4000
02:08:14,620 --> 02:08:15,780
Totally not Pryp.

4001
02:08:15,780 --> 02:08:15,900
Totally not Pryp.

4002
02:08:15,900 --> 02:08:17,960
I put myself on Craigslist to beat something.

4003
02:08:18,520 --> 02:08:18,560
Yeah, on Craigslist.

4004
02:08:18,700 --> 02:08:21,300
And I need, like, meet a collab partner.

4005
02:08:22,180 --> 02:08:26,280
Meet a collab partner who's good at, like, FPS games.

4006
02:08:26,620 --> 02:08:31,500
And also to make me look... but not good enough so that I can look good.

4007
02:08:34,420 --> 02:08:34,900
Yeah,

4008
02:08:39,440 --> 02:08:40,660
what is it, Ten?

4009
02:08:40,700 --> 02:08:41,300
What do you wanna say?

4010
02:08:41,540 --> 02:08:42,620
But obviously now we didn't do that.

4011
02:08:42,620 --> 02:08:43,520
No, I'm having a heart attack.

4012
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:45,200
Guys, we didn't do that, guys.

4013
02:08:45,220 --> 02:08:45,620
Obviously.

4014
02:08:45,900 --> 02:08:47,340
Like, he's a real person.

4015
02:08:47,560 --> 02:08:49,740
He's a real person.

4016
02:08:49,740 --> 02:08:49,840
I am.

4017
02:08:49,880 --> 02:08:50,160
He's a real person.

4018
02:08:50,180 --> 02:08:51,260
I'm not a paid actor.

4019
02:08:51,420 --> 02:08:51,640
Don't worry.

4020
02:08:51,640 --> 02:08:52,960
He's not a paid actor, guys.

4021
02:08:53,200 --> 02:08:56,020
Totally not behind in contract to say this.

4022
02:08:56,180 --> 02:09:00,060
When I sent him that $160, we did not plan this, guys.

4023
02:09:00,180 --> 02:09:08,200
Because it was not because that $160 was, like, part of his, like, hourly wage for, like, playing with me.

4024
02:09:10,880 --> 02:09:13,720
It was a real challenge, guys.

4025
02:09:13,980 --> 02:09:15,620
A very real challenge.

4026
02:09:15,620 --> 02:09:16,080
A real challenge.

4027
02:09:19,700 --> 02:09:21,060
My pits are sweating.

4028
02:09:23,660 --> 02:09:30,280
Any final words, Tenjin, before I talk to my dragoons and you talk to your Anjings?

4029
02:09:32,520 --> 02:09:33,560
Thank you.

4030
02:09:33,780 --> 02:09:38,680
And honestly, I'm actually... what do you call it?

4031
02:09:38,720 --> 02:09:39,640
I'm in a rush right now.

4032
02:09:39,960 --> 02:09:41,100
Oh, wait.

4033
02:09:41,200 --> 02:09:41,420
Why?

4034
02:09:42,340 --> 02:09:44,580
Because I have to head to a hospital.

4035
02:09:44,580 --> 02:09:46,180
Wait, what?

4036
02:09:47,620 --> 02:09:50,740
My grandfather is going through a surgery.

4037
02:09:50,980 --> 02:09:51,820
Oh shit!

4038
02:09:52,120 --> 02:09:53,440
Oh my god!

4039
02:09:53,640 --> 02:09:54,300
Yeah, fuck!

4040
02:09:54,680 --> 02:09:55,780
Go do that!

4041
02:09:55,880 --> 02:09:56,420
Go!

4042
02:09:56,480 --> 02:09:56,860
Go!

4043
02:09:56,940 --> 02:09:57,960
What the fuck!

4044
02:09:59,560 --> 02:10:01,640
Yeah, go freaking do it!

4045
02:10:01,660 --> 02:10:02,480
What are you doing here?

4046
02:10:02,900 --> 02:10:05,240
An hour later probably, yeah.

4047
02:10:05,340 --> 02:10:07,260
Alright, GG man!

4048
02:10:07,680 --> 02:10:08,320
GG!

4049
02:10:10,040 --> 02:10:11,640
Alright, I'll see you dude.

4050
02:10:11,900 --> 02:10:12,900
See you next week.

4051
02:10:13,860 --> 02:10:14,500
Will do.

4052
02:10:14,660 --> 02:10:15,040
Bye!

4053
02:10:16,580 --> 02:10:17,020
Bye!

4054
02:10:18,940 --> 02:10:19,780
Oh my god!

4055
02:10:20,200 --> 02:10:21,100
What the fuck!

4056
02:10:21,140 --> 02:10:21,940
That went too real!

4057
02:10:24,160 --> 02:10:26,020
I hope like, yeah well...

4058
02:10:26,020 --> 02:10:28,900
He said it's in an hour so he'll be there in like...

4059
02:10:28,900 --> 02:10:31,240
He says plenty of time to go to the hospital.

4060
02:10:31,400 --> 02:10:32,260
But yeah, it was great!

4061
02:10:33,460 --> 02:10:35,000
Connecting with Tengen.

4062
02:10:35,040 --> 02:10:36,340
Let me swap real quick.

4063
02:10:38,580 --> 02:10:39,600
Where's my chatting screen?

4064
02:10:39,660 --> 02:10:40,080
There we go.

4065
02:10:42,120 --> 02:10:42,860
Add a...

4066
02:10:42,900 --> 02:10:43,700
Great time.

4067
02:10:44,640 --> 02:10:46,640
Um, hanging out with Tengen today.

4068
02:10:47,260 --> 02:10:47,860
Um...

4069
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:50,840
And just talking about like...

4070
02:10:50,840 --> 02:10:51,980
The most random shit.

4071
02:10:52,060 --> 02:10:53,480
And just fucking around.

4072
02:10:53,720 --> 02:10:54,940
Like he's a real homie.

4073
02:10:55,060 --> 02:10:57,360
He's a real homie slash bro.

4074
02:10:58,200 --> 02:11:00,420
So, just felt like, you know...

4075
02:11:00,420 --> 02:11:02,340
Just talk about the fucking craziest shit.

4076
02:11:06,420 --> 02:11:08,940
And just having fun time.

4077
02:11:09,040 --> 02:11:10,280
Just playing...

4078
02:11:10,280 --> 02:11:11,920
Would you hire him again?

4079
02:11:12,900 --> 02:11:13,820
He's a real friend.

4080
02:11:13,940 --> 02:11:15,520
He's a real person.

4081
02:11:15,720 --> 02:11:18,500
I did not hire him off of Fiverr.

4082
02:11:18,640 --> 02:11:20,260
And paid him a salary.

4083
02:11:20,280 --> 02:11:22,260
To make me look good, guys.

4084
02:11:22,480 --> 02:11:23,560
He's real!

4085
02:11:26,660 --> 02:11:28,920
None of it was scripted!

4086
02:11:28,940 --> 02:11:29,880
I swear!

4087
02:11:31,300 --> 02:11:32,940
All of it was...

4088
02:11:32,940 --> 02:11:33,500
Real!

4089
02:11:35,580 --> 02:11:36,860
Anyway guys...

4090
02:11:39,120 --> 02:11:39,760
Um...

4091
02:11:39,760 --> 02:11:40,300
Um...

4092
02:11:40,300 --> 02:11:41,040
It was a great time.

4093
02:11:42,900 --> 02:11:44,400
I didn't think I was gonna play Rust.

4094
02:11:44,740 --> 02:11:45,960
For so long.

4095
02:11:46,680 --> 02:11:49,200
But I actually enjoyed the roleplaying.

4096
02:11:49,620 --> 02:11:50,940
And like...

4097
02:11:50,940 --> 02:11:51,700
It was actually funny.

4098
02:11:52,080 --> 02:11:53,980
Willnef actually followed me back on Twitter.

4099
02:11:54,160 --> 02:11:55,260
Which I thought was funny.

4100
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:57,020
Which I thought was really nice.

4101
02:11:57,240 --> 02:11:59,060
Because I didn't think he would...

4102
02:11:59,060 --> 02:12:01,520
He's also a pretty big streamer.

4103
02:12:01,780 --> 02:12:04,640
So I thought it was really nice that...

4104
02:12:05,360 --> 02:12:06,680
Willnef followed me back.

4105
02:12:06,760 --> 02:12:08,180
For those who don't know who he was...

4106
02:12:08,180 --> 02:12:08,880
In Rust.

4107
02:12:08,880 --> 02:12:10,000
He was like...

4108
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:10,600
He was uncle.

4109
02:12:12,820 --> 02:12:14,420
The uncle Billy.

4110
02:12:14,940 --> 02:12:15,320
So...

4111
02:12:16,700 --> 02:12:18,240
Yeah, uncle baby Billy.

4112
02:12:19,460 --> 02:12:20,080
So...

4113
02:12:21,980 --> 02:12:22,600
Um...

4114
02:12:22,600 --> 02:12:24,520
So that was like...

4115
02:12:24,520 --> 02:12:25,280
A really fun time.

4116
02:12:26,520 --> 02:12:27,140
And...

4117
02:12:29,060 --> 02:12:29,680
Um...

4118
02:12:29,680 --> 02:12:33,440
And I had a great time on both Rust and Apex today.

4119
02:12:33,700 --> 02:12:35,880
I think tomorrow is a rest day for me.

4120
02:12:35,940 --> 02:12:36,140
Right?

4121
02:12:36,220 --> 02:12:38,460
Tomorrow is a... Yes!

4122
02:12:38,460 --> 02:12:38,700
Okay.

4123
02:12:38,880 --> 02:12:39,140
Thank God.

4124
02:12:39,160 --> 02:12:39,380
Okay.

4125
02:12:39,420 --> 02:12:40,860
Because I really need the rest right now.

4126
02:12:41,280 --> 02:12:42,380
I'm so tired.

4127
02:12:43,560 --> 02:12:45,000
The double streams...

4128
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:46,120
Made me so tired.

4129
02:12:46,360 --> 02:12:47,380
So I'm like... Oh thank God.

4130
02:12:47,420 --> 02:12:48,120
It's a rest day.

4131
02:12:48,480 --> 02:12:49,200
Oh thank God.

4132
02:12:51,240 --> 02:12:52,300
Because I was like...

4133
02:12:52,300 --> 02:12:52,820
Oh man.

4134
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:54,940
I don't think I have the energy...

4135
02:12:54,940 --> 02:12:55,840
For tomorrow.

4136
02:12:56,260 --> 02:12:57,300
I don't...

4137
02:12:59,460 --> 02:13:00,380
I don't...

4138
02:13:00,380 --> 02:13:02,760
I don't think I have the fucking...

4139
02:13:02,760 --> 02:13:03,300
Energy.

4140
02:13:06,060 --> 02:13:06,520
Um...

4141
02:13:06,520 --> 02:13:07,260
Yes everybody.

4142
02:13:07,420 --> 02:13:08,500
It was such a fun time.

4143
02:13:08,880 --> 02:13:09,760
It was actually really fun.

4144
02:13:09,920 --> 02:13:11,980
I was honestly so nervous.

4145
02:13:12,920 --> 02:13:13,520
Uh...

4146
02:13:13,520 --> 02:13:16,000
So nervous today in Rust.

4147
02:13:16,280 --> 02:13:18,940
And um... I like that...

4148
02:13:20,700 --> 02:13:21,300
Um...

4149
02:13:21,300 --> 02:13:22,440
Um...

4150
02:13:22,440 --> 02:13:25,320
I... I'm happy that I was able to have...

4151
02:13:25,320 --> 02:13:26,380
Like such a fun experience.

4152
02:13:27,260 --> 02:13:27,860
Um...

4153
02:13:27,860 --> 02:13:30,600
In Rust with everybody and just like...

4154
02:13:30,600 --> 02:13:32,840
Talking to... Making like new friends and stuff.

4155
02:13:33,040 --> 02:13:34,100
And roleplaying.

4156
02:13:34,260 --> 02:13:35,900
Because I'm always scared of roleplaying.

4157
02:13:35,900 --> 02:13:37,400
Because I'm very...

4158
02:13:37,400 --> 02:13:38,980
Scared of like...

4159
02:13:38,980 --> 02:13:41,080
I feel like I'm not a very good roleplayer.

4160
02:13:41,320 --> 02:13:44,140
So like I'm always super scared about roleplaying.

4161
02:13:44,260 --> 02:13:46,080
Just because I don't think I'm good at roleplaying.

4162
02:13:46,300 --> 02:13:48,000
So I'm glad that like...

4163
02:13:50,320 --> 02:13:51,440
I'm glad...

4164
02:13:51,440 --> 02:13:51,880
I'm glad...

4165
02:13:51,880 --> 02:13:53,100
That I was able to...

4166
02:13:53,760 --> 02:13:54,600
To our...

4167
02:13:54,600 --> 02:13:57,140
Like you know... Make it entertaining for people.

4168
02:13:57,520 --> 02:14:00,360
And had like really good roleplayers.

4169
02:14:00,360 --> 02:14:01,080
To like...

4170
02:14:02,860 --> 02:14:03,420
Um...

4171
02:14:03,420 --> 02:14:05,340
To like... Um...

4172
02:14:06,380 --> 02:14:07,520
Bounce off on.

4173
02:14:07,980 --> 02:14:09,640
Um... I... It was crazy.

4174
02:14:09,840 --> 02:14:12,060
Okay so I actually knew about the whole...

4175
02:14:12,060 --> 02:14:13,320
The Blood God shit.

4176
02:14:13,600 --> 02:14:15,360
Like because I remember...

4177
02:14:15,760 --> 02:14:17,740
I used to watch like...

4178
02:14:17,740 --> 02:14:20,300
Uh... I remember I watched the very first...

4179
02:14:20,300 --> 02:14:20,980
Rust Arc.

4180
02:14:21,220 --> 02:14:23,680
So the very very first Rust Arc...

4181
02:14:23,680 --> 02:14:25,140
With like...

4182
02:14:25,140 --> 02:14:27,380
When the Blood God thing first started.

4183
02:14:28,380 --> 02:14:28,980
Uh...

4184
02:14:29,700 --> 02:14:31,680
Like... I think like two years ago.

4185
02:14:32,740 --> 02:14:33,340
Um...

4186
02:14:33,340 --> 02:14:34,240
Two years ago.

4187
02:14:34,320 --> 02:14:35,880
Like the very first time...

4188
02:14:35,900 --> 02:14:37,800
The Blood God thing started.

4189
02:14:38,160 --> 02:14:39,160
Two years ago.

4190
02:14:39,360 --> 02:14:40,560
And I used to watch that.

4191
02:14:40,700 --> 02:14:42,240
I remember watching that too.

4192
02:14:42,600 --> 02:14:43,460
On stream.

4193
02:14:43,600 --> 02:14:44,520
It's a consistent lore.

4194
02:14:44,620 --> 02:14:45,940
Yeah it's not like this is new.

4195
02:14:47,840 --> 02:14:48,720
So... Um...

4196
02:14:48,720 --> 02:14:50,120
So like...

4197
02:14:50,120 --> 02:14:51,640
I was so...

4198
02:14:51,640 --> 02:14:52,900
Yeah it was during the pandemic.

4199
02:14:52,920 --> 02:14:55,660
So when the fact that I was able to like...

4200
02:14:55,660 --> 02:14:56,760
Be a part of it.

4201
02:14:56,820 --> 02:14:57,660
Cause this was like...

4202
02:14:58,620 --> 02:14:59,980
Pre... Like you know...

4203
02:14:59,980 --> 02:15:01,740
Before I was like a streamer thing.

4204
02:15:01,800 --> 02:15:03,420
Before I was like a streamer.

4205
02:15:03,420 --> 02:15:05,700
I remember watching shit like that.

4206
02:15:05,840 --> 02:15:06,900
Like watching it.

4207
02:15:06,980 --> 02:15:08,080
It wasn't even two years.

4208
02:15:08,140 --> 02:15:08,960
Was it three years ago?

4209
02:15:09,180 --> 02:15:11,440
Holy shit that was so long ago.

4210
02:15:11,960 --> 02:15:13,300
Like I think it was like three...

4211
02:15:13,300 --> 02:15:14,480
Three plus years ago.

4212
02:15:14,560 --> 02:15:17,120
When the Blood God thing first started.

4213
02:15:17,460 --> 02:15:18,860
And the fact that...

4214
02:15:19,420 --> 02:15:21,700
Like I got to be part of it now.

4215
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:23,600
It was four years ago?

4216
02:15:24,180 --> 02:15:25,440
Oh my god!

4217
02:15:26,580 --> 02:15:29,910
Oh my god!

4218
02:15:30,150 --> 02:15:30,750
Anyway...

4219
02:15:30,750 --> 02:15:34,090
Like I said that I got a chance to actually be part...

4220
02:15:34,090 --> 02:15:35,090
Of the...

4221
02:15:35,270 --> 02:15:36,350
Blood God cult.

4222
02:15:36,550 --> 02:15:38,850
Something I watched four years ago.

4223
02:15:38,890 --> 02:15:40,210
When I was like a nobody.

4224
02:15:40,650 --> 02:15:42,510
And then like four years later.

4225
02:15:42,690 --> 02:15:45,310
I actually got to meet Will Neff.

4226
02:15:45,510 --> 02:15:47,470
And like actually got to like...

4227
02:15:47,470 --> 02:15:49,090
RP and join the cult.

4228
02:15:49,210 --> 02:15:49,670
And everything.

4229
02:15:50,130 --> 02:15:51,210
Oh my god.

4230
02:15:51,270 --> 02:15:52,170
Like that shit was...

4231
02:15:52,170 --> 02:15:53,650
That shit blew my mind.

4232
02:15:53,910 --> 02:15:54,850
Like I was you know...

4233
02:15:54,850 --> 02:15:58,550
Like roleplaying as like super gullible and oblivious.

4234
02:15:58,550 --> 02:15:59,350
And stuff like that.

4235
02:15:59,590 --> 02:16:00,910
Cause I didn't you know...

4236
02:16:00,910 --> 02:16:03,230
For the RP's sake.

4237
02:16:05,410 --> 02:16:06,010
And...

4238
02:16:06,010 --> 02:16:08,470
And it was just... It was crazy.

4239
02:16:08,690 --> 02:16:10,190
I thought it was like crazy.

4240
02:16:10,970 --> 02:16:13,350
To be able to RP stuff like that.

4241
02:16:14,490 --> 02:16:17,030
For people that like I used to watch...

4242
02:16:17,030 --> 02:16:18,230
Four plus years ago.

4243
02:16:18,430 --> 02:16:20,650
And like also interact with like...

4244
02:16:20,650 --> 02:16:21,750
You were acting?

4245
02:16:21,910 --> 02:16:23,150
Okay maybe it was like...

4246
02:16:23,150 --> 02:16:24,290
Half acting.

4247
02:16:27,470 --> 02:16:28,070
Okay.

4248
02:16:30,590 --> 02:16:31,790
Half acting.

4249
02:16:33,790 --> 02:16:34,350
Um...

4250
02:16:34,350 --> 02:16:35,430
Yeah.

4251
02:16:35,550 --> 02:16:37,310
So it was pretty fun.

4252
02:16:37,470 --> 02:16:38,890
I had a great time playing...

4253
02:16:38,890 --> 02:16:41,570
Rest and I'm really happy that Gumi...

4254
02:16:41,570 --> 02:16:43,150
Gave her time to...

4255
02:16:43,630 --> 02:16:44,850
Give me a tour.

4256
02:16:45,010 --> 02:16:45,370
You know?

4257
02:16:45,510 --> 02:16:48,210
Give me a tour and like introduce me to some people.

4258
02:16:48,630 --> 02:16:49,630
And like...

4259
02:16:49,630 --> 02:16:52,070
Like you know start the roleplay stuff.

4260
02:16:52,190 --> 02:16:52,690
And everything.

4261
02:16:53,030 --> 02:16:53,970
So yeah.

4262
02:16:54,070 --> 02:16:54,990
I had a great time.

4263
02:16:56,310 --> 02:16:56,870
Um...

4264
02:16:56,870 --> 02:16:58,650
And a great time...

4265
02:16:58,650 --> 02:17:00,550
Playing with Tenjin today.

4266
02:17:00,650 --> 02:17:01,770
And just like...

4267
02:17:01,790 --> 02:17:03,890
Hang out with Tenjin.

4268
02:17:04,230 --> 02:17:05,410
And uh...

4269
02:17:05,410 --> 02:17:06,810
You know like we've actually...

4270
02:17:06,810 --> 02:17:08,610
We've actually uh...

4271
02:17:08,610 --> 02:17:10,290
Hanged out a lot off stream.
