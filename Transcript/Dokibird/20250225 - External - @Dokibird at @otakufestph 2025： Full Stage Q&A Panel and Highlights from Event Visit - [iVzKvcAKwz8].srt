00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:29,460
She is top-ranked in Apex Legends, played with many professional players, and has participated in multiple tournaments.

3
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,340
Dragoons, give it up for Donkey Bird!

4
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:45,460
Hello?

5
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:46,620
Hello everyone!

6
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,920
Oh my god, I sound like death right now, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,540
My throat is not okay at the moment.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,840
It's okay, it's okay.

9
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:03,060
I have like tea by my side, I had medicine, I have honey, I have cough drops, like I'm gonna make it.

10
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:03,740
I hope.

11
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:04,820
I'm gonna be okay.

12
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:12,640
It's also midnight right now, but I know it's, the mud I see is very sunny right now in the Philippines.

13
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:13,740
But hello everybody!

14
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,360
Hello all the dragoons here in the Philippines!

15
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,180
Hello, hello!

16
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:18,940
Hello!

17
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,280
I'm sorry I sound like I'm about to die, I swear I'm okay.

18
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:24,780
It's just my throat.

19
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:35,120
And for those who don't actually know me, I was like who that, I'm sorry I'm trying to remember not to swear because I know there's children walking around because I'm outside, I'm not an enclosed area.

20
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,620
So like I know there's kids out there so I'm trying not to swear now.

21
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,820
Parents out there who are like, oh this is like an anime girl.

22
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,500
Clearly she's safe for kids.

23
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,860
I am not safe for children.

24
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,520
So my usual content is not PG friendly.

25
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,900
Anyway, but yes, it's me, Toki Baron!

26
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,100
Hello everybody!

27
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,420
Hello, hello!

28
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:06,480
So today I believe it's gonna be me talking about myself, of course, because I love myself.

29
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:14,840
And also there's gonna be a few questions I'm gonna be answering that I believe were sent to or were screened earlier.

30
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,700
So I'll be answering a couple of questions.

31
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:22,800
I don't know if like the staff is gonna read out the questions for me or if I'm reading out the questions.

32
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,300
But like I honestly I prefer the staff to read out the questions so I can talk less.

33
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,020
Don't worry, Toki Baron!

34
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:30,800
We're ready!

35
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,620
That's much more ideal for me.

36
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,220
Yes, we're ready to ask you two questions.

37
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,320
Hello everybody!

38
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,740
I guess that's my introduction.

39
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,040
I guess first question.

40
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,300
I guess if a staff could ask me my first question for today's panel.

41
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:49,620
Hey there!

42
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,920
Are you able to hear me, Toki?

43
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,180
Can you hear me?

44
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,320
Yeah, I can hear you.

45
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:55,520
Yeah.

46
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,600
Alright, we love that.

47
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,820
We are really sorry to hear that your voice or your throat hurts.

48
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,880
We hope that you feel better soon.

49
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:09,980
But your first question is, if it's alright with you, can you tell us your experience at OtakuFest?

50
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,460
How was meeting your Filipino dragoons?

51
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,900
Oh my god!

52
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:26,360
Okay, so like, I would say this at conventions, but it's always a great time to meet dragoons, especially from around the world.

53
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,720
Because it's always crazy to be like, oh my god, I have fans in so many different parts of the world.

54
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,460
Like, it's not just NA.

55
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,040
Like, oh my god, the world exists beyond just North America.

56
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,780
Which is, you know, for someone that's in NA, it's like, always blows my mind.

57
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,640
Like, for me to have like, oh my god, should I have fans?

58
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,400
Like, beyond just NA people.

59
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:48,120
And like, they actually like my content, even though I'm weird.

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,740
And it's always amazing to me.

61
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:58,460
I'm always really happy to know that a lot of you guys watch, especially with my messed up stream hours.

62
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:04,400
Because like, when I stream, I stream like, I stream like my times, you know, like my time zone.

63
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,620
So like, for you guys, you guys have to watch in the morning.

64
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,580
And like, I'm sorry.

65
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,640
Because it's like, you wake up to a Doki Bird stream.

66
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,500
And I don't know if that's a good thing to start your day off of my stream.

67
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:22,340
Because like, I don't know what's gonna... I mean, if anybody watched today's stream...

68
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:27,280
Well, technically, it was my today's stream, where we did like live 2D rigging of a dragoon.

69
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,080
I don't know if you want to start your day off of that stream.

70
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,960
Because that stream was wild.

71
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:39,140
We gave like a dragoon butt cheeks and like everything and like holding water balloons and stuff like that.

72
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:43,560
And like, if you start your day off of that stream, I'm sorry.

73
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:55,580
Anyway, so like I said, it's always great meeting dragoons from around the world because like, you know, I'm like, oh my God, you guys are real people.

74
00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:02,240
It's not like, you know, not like my manager bought me like a million bots AI's like talking in my chat.

75
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,440
But there's actual real people behind the chat.

76
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,900
And you're like, you guys exist.

77
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:13,000
Oh my God, it's not me and one other dragoon and 10,000 AI bots talking to me.

78
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,460
You guys are real people.

79
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,680
So it's been a great experience.

80
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,120
And it's also crazy.

81
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,240
Otaku Fest.

82
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,840
There's so many people at Otaku Fest.

83
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:23,460
I'm actually going to be getting a tour of Otaku Fest later.

84
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:23,700
Okay.

85
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,740
I don't know if I should have said that because now I might get mobbed.

86
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,360
I think I wasn't supposed to say that.

87
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:32,700
Whoops.

88
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,100
Oops.

89
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,100
But I'm going to be getting a tour, checking out Otaku Fest later to see, like, I already said it anyway.

90
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,940
So I might as well double down on it.

91
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,880
It's not like I'm going to be like, JK, I'm not.

92
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,820
But it's going to be exciting to see the rest of Otaku Fest and, like, you know, buying my own merch because I love myself.

93
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,280
And just seeing so many of my, like, you know, Filipino dragoons and stuff and meeting you guys.

94
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,380
It's always a great time.

95
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,380
But yeah, hope that answers your question.

96
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,280
Yes.

97
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,800
Who are the dragoons in the audience with Doki Bird merch?

98
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,020
There you go.

99
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:10,360
Oh, yeah.

100
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,320
Buy my merch, guys.

101
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,980
And I'm sure that they're excited to have their breakfast watching Doki Bird in the morning.

102
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:25,340
And as we know, Cebu is known for its cuisine like lechon.

103
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,940
What food here would you like to try?

104
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,760
Oh, my God.

105
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,060
Okay.

106
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,780
So, actually, in one of my meet and greets, I met so many dragoons.

107
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,340
Apparently, I met 50 dragoons, which is crazy.

108
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,200
Like, it passed.

109
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:39,820
But I didn't...

110
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,900
When I was doing it, it didn't feel like 50.

111
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:46,040
But, like, I met 50 dragoons in the meet and greet in one day, which is a lot.

112
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,360
I think that's, like, my record in terms of, like, meet and greets.

113
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,120
How many dragoons I can meet in one day.

114
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,440
50 is definitely my record right now.

115
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,940
But, like, one of my dragoons was like, you gotta check out Balut.

116
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,140
And I was like, the heck is Balut?

117
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,720
And then I...

118
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,560
You know, the great thing about being a, you know, being a YouTuber is that I can...

119
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,840
I can Google what Balut is in the middle of the meet and greet.

120
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,780
And I was like, oh, my...

121
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,860
Okay, this was actually the first time I've ever seen what a Balut is.

122
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,380
And, like, you know, you like...

123
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,300
It's like...

124
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:20,920
What is it?

125
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,120
Like, a fertilized...

126
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,620
Like, a fertilized egg.

127
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:24,700
And, like...

128
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,960
And then, like, I was reading it.

129
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,180
And they're like, oh, yeah, it's just like...

130
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,240
It's just a little crunchy.

131
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,060
And I was like, a little crunchy?

132
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,300
There's a whole ass duckling in there.

133
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,840
What do you mean a little crunchy?

134
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,440
And it's because they're...

135
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,240
And I read the description.

136
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,320
Like, oh, yeah, the bones aren't developed yet.

137
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,220
So, maybe it'd be a bit crunchy.

138
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,860
I was like, oh, my God.

139
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,820
I was like, oh, my God.

140
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,320
I mean, it's interesting.

141
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,400
I mean, to be fair, I'm also Asian.

142
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,220
So, like, I've ate some weird shit, too.

143
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:52,960
So, like...

144
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,660
So, yeah, I've ate some weird shit.

145
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,520
So, I was like, you know what?

146
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,460
This can't be the weirdest thing I've ever eaten, to be fair.

147
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,180
If I ever do try Baloo.

148
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,880
Because, like, I've eaten...

149
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,900
My mom once tricked me into eating worms.

150
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:09,960
So, like...

151
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,420
Like, there's, like, a cuisine.

152
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,680
And there's, like...

153
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,780
Yeah, my mom once tricked me.

154
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,220
They're like, you should try this.

155
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,280
And there's, like, there's, like, worms drenched in, like, hot soup or whatever.

156
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,940
And I was like, what is that?

157
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,940
And they're like, you should try it.

158
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,580
And then I tried it.

159
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,340
And she's like, it's worms.

160
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,220
And I was like, did you like it?

161
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,340
And obviously, I'd be like...

162
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,460
Like, I'm like, no.

163
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,100
But, um, I'm interested in trying Baloo.

164
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,440
And then I'm actually not gonna lie.

165
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,420
I've never tried Ube.

166
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,220
Like, it's actually, like, it's so rare.

167
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,580
I've never tried it before.

168
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,360
I've not tried...

169
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,600
I've had Taro before.

170
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,900
Like, the other purple thing.

171
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,640
But I've actually never had Ube before.

172
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,500
Which is something I've always wanted to try.

173
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,780
And then there's also, like...

174
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,080
And then everybody kept eating.

175
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,540
Like, and I had someone that was like, have you ever tried Jollibee's?

176
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,880
Luckily, there's a Jollibee's in Canada.

177
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,160
But then they're like, yeah, but have you ever had the mango pie?

178
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,620
And I was like, no.

179
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,420
And they're like, oh, my God.

180
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,720
You had tried Jollibee's, but never the mango pie?

181
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,520
And I'm like, okay, buddy.

182
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:20,560
The peach mango pie was apparently a crime that I didn't try yet.

183
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,920
But I'll try...

184
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,580
Since I do have a Jollibee's in Canada, I will try the peach mango pie.

185
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,240
Because that's, like, the most easily obtainable thing I could get.

186
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,580
I think Ube, too.

187
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,320
Because, like, Ube also seems very easy.

188
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,000
I don't know about Balut, though.

189
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,620
I don't know if I could get Balut in Canada.

190
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:46,960
But I think Ube and peach mango pie is the most easy obtainable thing I can get, like, so far.

191
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,700
But yeah, these are three things I would love to try out for in the Philippines.

192
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,360
Alright, thank you so much for that, Doki.

193
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,380
If I'm going to be honest, I'm going to recommend Ube more.

194
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:07,760
But, you know, you mentioned that there are a lot of perks of being a VTuber.

195
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:13,900
Which is why we wanted to ask, what is your most memorable experience of being a VTuber?

196
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,760
Oh, man.

197
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,260
There's so many, to be fair.

198
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,980
Because I've done a lot of stuff now.

199
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,520
Like, I've done so many things.

200
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:31,820
So it's like, it's so difficult to be like, what would be your most memorable thing?

201
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:40,720
I think, okay, recently, I think it would be the Phantom Thief concert that I did with Mint.

202
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:45,580
Because I think you guys all know, like, it's literally a 3D concert.

203
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:51,720
And that shit was so hard to prep for.

204
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:58,180
And like, usually concerts would take like, a year in development.

205
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:04,320
We got that stuff done in like, two to three months prepping for this.

206
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:09,520
Like, it was like two to three months of prep for this concert.

207
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,160
So it was like, I, oh my, that was hell.

208
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:13,940
That was actual.

209
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,460
Like, dance practice.

210
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:21,860
Like, we had a month of dance practices to get ready for the concert.

211
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,940
It's like a month and a half of dance practice, which is not a lot.

212
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,360
Weird, there were so many songs in there.

213
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,420
It was like, yeah, a month and a half of dance practices.

214
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:37,440
And we've only had like, two rehearsals together of us dancing together.

215
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,440
So like, it was basically all or nothing at the concert.

216
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,940
So like, but it was such a great experience.

217
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:48,060
Like, like, I don't know if you guys know, it's in those 3D suits.

218
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,040
It's so tiring.

219
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,700
Because there's wires everywhere.

220
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,060
So like, you can't slap each other.

221
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:58,660
Like, if you slap on the back of somebody, you like, you, it's so like, difficult.

222
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,940
Because like, wires can get tangled and stuff.

223
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,680
So it was, oh my God, it was such a wild experience.

224
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,620
Because we have to like, figure out where we are.

225
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:10,220
Because sometimes when we're touching somebody, our hands might not actually be touching each other.

226
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:14,360
So then we're like, okay, I'm gonna bend my hand a little differently.

227
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,480
So it looks like we're touching each other, even though we're not.

228
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:26,180
And then like, you know, it was just such a wild experience.

229
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:36,680
And then being in the, the stadium itself, when we were there, like, being the auditorium, like where the concert was held was absolutely insane.

230
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,080
Like, it was a beautiful event.

231
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,540
And I would love to do more of these in the future.

232
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,640
If anybody wants to like, you know, help us host.

233
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:49,400
Like, obviously, we didn't pay for the, or like, setting up the concert or anything.

234
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:54,360
The, the sponsor or the organizers paid us to do the concert.

235
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,260
So we would love to be able to do something like that again in the future.

236
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,460
Because it was definitely like, such a great experience.

237
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,340
Like doing 3D stuff has been amazing.

238
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:06,560
But that has to be one of my most memorable experiences as a VTuber.

239
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,860
I think doing 3D is very memorable in general.

240
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,680
Because it's just different from doing, you know, being 2D.

241
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,020
Because I'm literally in my pajamas right now.

242
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,060
It's, it's 12 a.m.

243
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,840
and I'm in my pajamas, relaxing.

244
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,880
I'm not sweating like crazy right now in 3D.

245
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:34,180
But that has to be one of my most memorable experiences as a VTuber.

246
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,760
That's definitely amazing.

247
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:39,760
Gosh.

248
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:44,600
I heard that we have some questions from the audience for you, Doki Bird.

249
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,500
Would you like to answer them?

250
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:54,140
Can we ask our first audience member to come on stage to ask their question for Doki Bird?

251
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,720
Of course, of course.

252
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,500
There you go.

253
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,280
You can wave and say hi to Doki.

254
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,320
Hello.

255
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:07,620
Hello.

256
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,160
Oh my God.

257
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,240
Look, there he is.

258
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,180
I can see him.

259
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,180
Can you ask Doki Bird?

260
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:14,900
What is your question?

261
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:15,740
Of course.

262
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,680
Hello there, Doki.

263
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,060
Hi.

264
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,440
I'm sorry.

265
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:19,720
I'm sorry.

266
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,160
They're a little bit nervous.

267
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,840
I'm a little nervous.

268
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,460
I'm sorry.

269
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,300
Okay.

270
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,360
Okay.

271
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,200
For my question.

272
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,100
I'm Fane.

273
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,020
I have a friend over in America.

274
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:31,800
Her name is Alora.

275
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:37,440
I'd like to ask you since you've been an inspiration for both of us for quite some time at this point.

276
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:42,520
And I'd like to ask if you had any tips or advice for us as upcoming VTubers.

277
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,280
Whoa.

278
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,220
Whoa.

279
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:46,820
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

280
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,420
Aspiring VTubers.

281
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,260
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

282
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:48,660
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

283
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:48,740
Okay.

284
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,680
That's a good question.

285
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,080
Okay.

286
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,880
So like, actually, I remember someone asked me that at this meeting.

287
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:53,080
Great.

288
00:14:53,540 --> 00:15:06,520
Um, but first thing is that you have to know this content creation in general, but like in content creation, it's not, it's 90% luck in general to like your big break or et cetera and stuff like that.

289
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,680
So like, so don't be discouraged if you're like, oh, I'm not, why is this not working?

290
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,980
Like, am I not working hard enough?

291
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,800
No, it's just cause you haven't had your lucky break yet.

292
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:22,120
And technically, um, especially like the bigger, the long, like basically like you can't, you don't become famous overnight.

293
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,280
Um, unless you, I don't know, unless you get into a big company.

294
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:29,400
Um, but you don't, you don't get famous overnight.

295
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:39,220
Um, um, if you're in indie or like if you're starting out and it's usually like, you have to know the algorithm really, really well.

296
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:46,500
So like, you know, if you guys don't know, like people today, we have very, very short attention spans today.

297
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,980
Like, I know you guys are all like looking at TikTok and YouTube shorts and stuff like that.

298
00:15:51,060 --> 00:16:00,940
And that's why I spam YouTube shorts and TikTok because I know you guys don't have the attention span for long things anymore because I don't either.

299
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:07,080
Um, I don't have ADHD, but I can spend like hours on YouTube shorts and TikTok.

300
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:23,220
Um, so like I would highly suggest like, you know, if you, if you don't want to pay for editors, learn how to edit and make your own YouTube shorts and make your own TikToks and just keep posting those and then like get the algorithm into it.

301
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,980
And like, uh, like get into the algorithm and stuff like that.

302
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,000
Use tags, network.

303
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,560
Networking is really good.

304
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,080
Collaborate with people and stuff like that.

305
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,780
It's always good to networking and make friends.

306
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,240
You can't really, unless you're KSO, I guess.

307
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,700
KSO somehow blew up by doing solo stuff all the time.

308
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:51,960
Um, but as a VTuber, it's really hard to, to like, you know, like VTubing, you have to connect to people.

309
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,520
You can't be like you're in your own little space.

310
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,980
You actually have to like talk to people, interact with people.

311
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:00,980
Um, and as an introvert, I know it's really hard because it's really hard for me.

312
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:07,580
Literally like, I, I, I'm really bad at talking to people and I just be like, I just messaged me like collab.

313
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,680
And they'll be like collab and be like, cool.

314
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:13,740
Like, there's like, I don't know.

315
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,400
I'm really bad at small talk.

316
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,380
I just be like, do you want to collab?

317
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,640
And they'll be like, sure.

318
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,700
And I'll be like, cool.

319
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,180
Okay.

320
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,140
Um, first step done.

321
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:28,020
Um, um, um, but yeah, that's really my advice.

322
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:34,720
It's mostly, like, know the algorithm, abuse shorts, network, talk to people, communicate.

323
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,460
And, yeah, that's really it, mostly.

324
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:42,900
And then just remember that it's mostly about luck, in terms of, like, becoming, quote-unquote, popular.

325
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,480
And, like, you know, it's also time, too.

326
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,660
Like, you gotta invest a lot of time into it.

327
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,200
And don't put all your eggs in one basket.

328
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,860
Like, diversify your, like, posting and stuff like that.

329
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,920
Don't just be on Twitch.

330
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,960
Post, like, maybe post videos on YouTube and then stream on Twitch, stuff like that.

331
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,540
Post stuff on TikTok.

332
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,880
Post stuff on Instagram.

333
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,860
Don't focus on everything on Twitter and stuff like that.

334
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,640
Just make sure to do as much as you can.

335
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,820
But, yeah, that's my advice.

336
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,780
I'm also very tired.

337
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:13,960
Thank you.

338
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:14,980
It's so nice to meet you.

339
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:15,600
Thank you.

340
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,100
Yeah, no problem.

341
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,480
It's a lot of work.

342
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:20,500
Thank you so much.

343
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,060
Be safe in going down the stage.

344
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:22,840
All right.

345
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,440
Do we have our next audience question?

346
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,300
All right.

347
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,120
Please come here up the stage and you may ask your question.

348
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,040
All right.

349
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,560
Yes, we have our lovely lady in red.

350
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,480
Okay.

351
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,160
Okay.

352
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,200
We move slightly here.

353
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:40,960
Hello.

354
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,200
Hi, Doki.

355
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:43,960
Oh, my God.

356
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,620
So, I'm being a big fan of you.

357
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,640
So, it's, like, I'm really happy to see you.

358
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,540
And my question for you is, like, how are you these days?

359
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,560
Like, that's pretty simple since I didn't know what to say.

360
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,160
But, yeah, I just want to know how are you these days, really?

361
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,220
I'm very caring.

362
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,800
I almost swore.

363
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,480
I'm sorry.

364
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,540
I almost swore.

365
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,520
I had to stop myself.

366
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,760
I was like, there's children here.

367
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,840
I'm very sick.

368
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,920
No, but, like, I'm a lot better now.

369
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:20,920
If it was, like, two days ago, I would have been so messed up.

370
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,040
But today, my throat, my throat doesn't hurt.

371
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,020
It's just I sound like I'm chain smoke.

372
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,220
I've been chain smoking for 10 years, but I don't smoke, by the way, guys.

373
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,560
I just sound like that.

374
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,760
But, like, it doesn't hurt.

375
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,840
It's just you could tell, like, it's fighting for its life right now.

376
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,540
My voice is fighting for its life.

377
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,240
But other than that, I am tired because, like...

378
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,580
Okay, so for those who don't know, I've been...

379
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:54,260
My immune system ever since COVID, my immune system is, like, you're not supposed to be alive.

380
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,520
Because, like, no, it's, like, basically, when you're a bubble...

381
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,640
I talked about this on stream.

382
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,040
Look, I'm not dying, guys.

383
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:03,860
I'm not dying.

384
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,660
I'm okay.

385
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:17,640
But it's more so, like, when you've been stuck inside since COVID, your immune system gets weaker because you're, like, not exposed to, like, outside bacteria.

386
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,200
So your immune system is like, whoa, let's party.

387
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,780
We don't care about threats anymore.

388
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,640
So we can chill and relax.

389
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:34,660
And then because I've been stuck inside for, like, two plus years, and then everybody was like, it's okay, guys.

390
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,000
You can go outside now.

391
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:39,760
I still didn't go outside because, like, at the time, I lived...

392
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,940
My parents lived with me.

393
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:41,780
I didn't live with my parents.

394
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,080
My parents lived with me.

395
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,560
So they're like, we'll take care of you.

396
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:49,640
So you can focus on work and you don't have to go outside if you have to.

397
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,900
So I'll be like, yeah.

398
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:56,540
So my immune system got even weaker because they're like, you have no bacteria anymore.

399
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,640
No more threats to your life.

400
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,160
And then now I live by myself.

401
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:07,440
So, like, for almost half, more than half a year, I had to go outside.

402
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:12,620
And, like, my body is like, what is all these things outside?

403
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,340
Like, we haven't seen these for years.

404
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,780
So I've been sick for, like...

405
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:23,420
Okay, so, like, I have been, like, perpetually sick.

406
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,960
Not, like, on and off for, like, more than half a year.

407
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,480
And a lot of dragons know this because, like, if you click on random bots, you could hear.

408
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,160
Sometimes I would be, like, randomly coughing or, like, my throat sounds just like this.

409
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,440
But then, like, two weeks later, I'd be okay.

410
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,100
And then a month later, I'm back to, like, that.

411
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,700
So it's like, I'm, like, perpetually on and off of sickness right now.

412
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,700
I'm hoping this is the last time.

413
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:56,520
I'm hoping that my immune system has finally learned what it means to, like, you know, protect myself is like.

414
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:00,100
So, like, I hope this is the last time I get sick.

415
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,540
But I know it's not.

416
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,280
I'm just coping right now.

417
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,920
I'm just heavily coping.

418
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,760
But, yeah, like, I've been sick.

419
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,140
And I felt better.

420
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,160
And then, you know, I've been sick.

421
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,240
And then I went to Japan.

422
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,160
And I came back from Japan.

423
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,640
And then I got sick.

424
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,700
And then I got better.

425
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,280
And then I got sick again last week.

426
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,980
And then here I am.

427
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,220
But I'm mentally, I'm okay.

428
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,220
Physically, I might not be.

429
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,060
But, like, mentally, I'm all right.

430
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:40,420
Yes, everyone here at Otaku Fest is wishing you well.

431
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,020
Right, guys?

432
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,480
Thank you.

433
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,360
Thank you, guys.

434
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,720
I really need it.

435
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,780
Also, like, also, like, don't try to go to doctors in Canada.

436
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,720
It's hopeless.

437
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,800
There's, like, you can't get a doctor in Canada, too.

438
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:57,920
Oh, no.

439
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,560
Thank you very much.

440
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,880
And I think we have time for one last audience question.

441
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,140
All right.

442
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,060
Next question.

443
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,420
Hello, my neighbor Totoro.

444
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,740
Sporting hour at Otaku Fest shirt.

445
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,360
Oh, my God, it's cute.

446
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,120
Here, let's move close.

447
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,980
Let's move to the center so that Doki can see you.

448
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,160
Hello, Doki.

449
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:19,880
It's fine.

450
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,180
Hey.

451
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,240
I'm really, I'm very...

452
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,380
Oh, thank you.

453
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:26,420
I admire your game sense and all your videos.

454
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:34,860
So I was just asking as a new to Marvel rivals, how do you survive five seconds in the game as just the support in the team?

455
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,340
Oh.

456
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,260
Could you, could you repeat that?

457
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,020
It cut off the internet buffered a little there.

458
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:50,980
Oh, um, as new to Marvel rivals, I wanted to know how do you survive five seconds in the game as just a support in the team?

459
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,840
Oh, okay.

460
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,600
That's, that's crazy because sometimes you don't.

461
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:01,880
Okay, so, like, it depends on what rank you are.

462
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:06,260
So, like, for those who don't know, I'm one above all in Marvel Rivals.

463
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,780
For those who are like, what the heck is one above all?

464
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,260
That's top 500 in Marvel Rivals.

465
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:16,460
And I've been top 500 since, uh, season zero to now, because I'm still top 500 now.

466
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:21,840
Um, and so, like, I played support and I main Luna.

467
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,420
I main meta.

468
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,620
I'm like a meta slave.

469
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:31,620
So, like, uh, I main Luna, cloak, uh, I can play Adam, I can play Loki if I have to.

470
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:34,880
I can play Miss Fantastic if I have to.

471
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,720
Um, but, like, my most comfortable pick is obviously Luna is my most comfortable pick.

472
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:43,140
Like, she's my specialty, but I can play other supports at that level, too.

473
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,500
I just like playing Luna the most.

474
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:50,080
Um, but it really depends on what support you're playing, uh, and, like, what the meta is now.

475
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:58,360
Um, I haven't played this season yet because, like, you know, everybody's still experimenting on what the meta is this season because there's so many things that got nerfed.

476
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:09,320
Um, but, like, honestly, uh, always, like, what I notice in lower elo is that support players don't trust the other support player.

477
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,300
I notice that a lot.

478
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:27,000
So, like, um, you have to actually, if you really, really want to climb as a support player, because, if you guys didn't know, being a support player is one of the hardest, uh, class to climb as because you're only as good as your team.

479
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:31,220
Um, and if your team is shit, like, you die, okay?

480
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:42,600
Like, so, um, unless you play Adam, Adam and Mantis are the only two characters I know where you can solo carry it because you're basically a DPS character.

481
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:47,580
Um, but, um, you have to actually talk to your team.

482
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:57,860
Because if you don't, then, like, you know, you can't, if you get dived, like, you have to tell your team, I'm getting, you know, beat up by Iron Fist or something.

483
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,300
So you have to actually call for help and stuff.

484
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,900
You have to actually use voice chat and stuff.

485
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:13,880
And then you have to talk to your other support because the only way to survive flankers is if you and your support work together as a team, you don't run away from your other support.

486
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,300
You actually have to actually work together.

487
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,000
I know it's very hard to do because you always, you think the other support is bad.

488
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:28,260
Um, but you have to work together, um, to, like, kill flankers together because that's the whole point, um, to beat a flanker.

489
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,820
And then you have to also be like, I alt first to yell at your other support.

490
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,700
Be like, don't alt first, I alt first.

491
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:42,700
Because double support all together is like the biggest, the worst thing you can ever do in the game because I got yelled at for that.

492
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:50,680
I got yelled at by one person and he's hated me ever since I double support ulted with him like one month ago and he still hates me.

493
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:55,200
Like, I never double support ulted.

494
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:01,160
Every time he sees me, he's like, oh my god, Dokiberg, you freaking suck.

495
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,100
And I'm like, what, because of that one time I double support ulted?

496
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:07,980
But yeah, it's that too.

497
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:11,660
And then I guess like, there's so many things you have to do.

498
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:17,300
And if you're like playing an aim character, you have to like, obviously you have to know how to aim.

499
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:23,680
But if you're playing somebody like, you know, cloak and dagger, it's more about knowing what abilities you have.

500
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:30,540
And then screaming at your Magneto to bubble you when you ult because like, if you don't, then the enemy Magneto is going to be like, fear.

501
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,160
And then you're like, oh, I'm dead.

502
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,500
But yeah, that's basically all my tips regarding support play.

503
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:44,680
I mean, I could give you guys more, but like, this whole, I can actually talk about Marvel Rivals for like two hours.

504
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,740
So I don't want to do that because we have 30 minutes left.

505
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:58,820
But, but you want to know my honest and honest advice on how to climb as a support player, do all of a DPS player.

506
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,300
Then like, at least you have someone you can rely on.

507
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,700
But that like, that's like the easiest way to climb.

508
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,900
Duo with somebody.

509
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:17,680
Because if you solo queue as a support player, you don't love yourself and you just want to suffer.

510
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,000
Please come back since PH.

511
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,000
Thank you.

512
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,120
Of course.

513
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:27,780
Thank you.

514
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,300
All right.

515
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,540
Thank you so much for those wonderful questions.

516
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:35,820
Unfortunately, those are the only questions we're able to entertain.

517
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:43,480
But however, uh, Doki Bird over here was very much happy to answer to all those questions.

518
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,300
Right, ladies and gentlemen?

519
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,880
Let's give her a big round of applause!

520
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:47,580
Woo!

521
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,340
That's great!

522
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,760
Round of applause to me!

523
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:58,480
So before you leave, uh, Doki Bird, if it's all right with you, we have a tiny request.

524
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,740
Can you say...

525
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,620
Yeah, of course.

526
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,120
Gihigugma Kita Cebu?

527
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,880
That means, I love you Cebu in Cebuano.

528
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:16,340
Okay, I'm gonna butcher this so badly because I'm very bad with languages.

529
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,420
I can say that one more time for you.

530
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,360
Okay, can you say it again?

531
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,400
Gihigugma Kita Cebu.

532
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,440
Okay.

533
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,700
Gihigugma Tika Cebu.

534
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,520
Did I do it?

535
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,040
Oh yeah, I did it!

536
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:32,840
Let's go!

537
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,300
I'm so smart.

538
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,380
I knew I could do it.

539
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,980
You actually said it perfectly, Doki.

540
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:38,840
Yes!

541
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:44,460
And does our OtakuFest audience want to say I love you back to Doki Bird?

542
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:52,690
Doh!

543
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:55,350
Woo!

544
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:56,750
Buy my merch.

545
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:03,330
So much love for you Doki Bird.

546
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:07,150
Do you have one last thing you would like to say to our audience before you take your leave?

547
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:11,090
Oh my god, thank you again for inviting me.

548
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:13,890
Oh my gosh, that time passed by so fast.

549
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:14,870
I thought I had longer.

550
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:17,490
Honestly, I would have talked to you even a lot more.

551
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:18,790
But like, thank you guys.

552
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:21,870
It's been a great time being here in OtakuFest.

553
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:26,030
I always appreciate being invited to these conventions, meeting all of you guys.

554
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:27,170
It's always such a pleasure.

555
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:29,870
I don't care what time it is on my end.

556
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:32,930
I always wanted to talk to you, my dragoons from around the world.

557
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:34,950
And of course, buy my merch.

558
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:38,370
Oh, and subscribe to me too.

559
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:39,550
I guess that's also important.

560
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:48,930
Once again, Doki Bird's doll is near the entrance of the Mountain Way if you'd like to check out her merchandise.

561
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:54,990
So, alright.

562
00:30:55,250 --> 00:31:05,210
So for those who are a big fan of Doki Bird as well, we'd like to ask you guys to please go to the Doki Bird tribute area.

563
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:08,590
It's actually right near the Artist Alley for a fan meet.

564
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:12,910
Just to provide a welcome to Doki Bird.

565
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:20,450
Everyone is welcome for Doki Bird tribute area near the Artist Alley for a really, really short and quick fan meet.

566
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:26,190
Once again, thank you so much Doki Bird for giving us the time learning more about you.

567
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:29,110
We hope, once again, you feel much better.

568
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:35,430
But in the meantime, good luck, be safe, and once again, Sibu loves you.

569
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:39,030
Oh, thank you!

570
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,340
Thank you!

571
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,460
Alright, everyone.

572
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,980
Bye-bye, guys!

573
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,200
Bye-bye!

574
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,560
Is that the only one you have left?

575
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:24,600
I'll talk to you later.

576
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:24,660
Bye-bye!
