1
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,800
Hello, everybody!

2
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,980
Hello, hello!

3
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:57,660
Welcome to the Dell and Dawson Stationery and Supplies Collab.

4
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,460
For those who don't know what this game is about...

5
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,960
By the way, I had a really good lunch and I'm sort of tired right now.

6
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,580
I'm just like, no!

7
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,540
Why did I have to eat something good today?

8
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,760
Now I'm tired!

9
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,640
Why does my body betray me like this?

10
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,240
Anyway, so as I was saying...

11
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,620
As I was saying, for those who don't know what this game is about...

12
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:28,900
It's basically The Office, but what if it's Among Us?

13
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,000
Like, it's literally The Office.

14
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:39,000
So there's like a map on there where it's a one-to-one recreation of The Office's office.

15
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,580
And they even have like one of the tasks you have to do.

16
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,320
Like, if you're like the imposter, which is like the slacker...

17
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,520
You have to put a jello on a stapler.

18
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,860
So it's literally...

19
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,000
They literally just took The Office and was like, Among Us.

20
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,660
By the way, I've never worked an office job before.

21
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:07,140
So like, my only knowledge of what an office job is gonna be like is literally The Office.

22
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,640
So like, I don't know.

23
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,340
I think this is a heavy roleplay lobby.

24
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,880
So I'm just like, I've never worked in an office before.

25
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,820
What do I...

26
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,980
Paperwork.

27
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,440
I was like, paperwork?

28
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,640
Doing inventory?

29
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,980
The quarterly reports?

30
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,860
Sensitivity trading?

31
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:32,380
Like, I'm just gonna spout out random office lingo and see if like...

32
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,840
See if it works.

33
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:36,960
Okay, so...

34
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,620
I was invited by...

35
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,960
Shoto to join the collab.

36
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,580
It's with a lot of Fleshtubers.

37
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,380
I believe majority of them is from...

38
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,760
Offline TV.

39
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:47,700
So...

40
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,240
I was given a list of people in the collab.

41
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,480
But they said there's more people.

42
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,200
So like, I don't really know who the...

43
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,540
Like, what's the full list?

44
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,040
I don't...

45
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,920
I don't know who are the full list of participants.

46
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,160
But...

47
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,160
It's a lot of Fleshtubers.

48
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,460
I think it's just me and Shoto are the only VTubers participating, I believe.

49
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,600
Unless IKUNA...

50
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,820
Shoto is going in in his VTuber form.

51
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:25,000
But it's me, Shoto, Sykuno, LM, Valkyrie, Tina, Kitten, FoolishGamers, ChocoBars, Katamina, Maisayoshi, plus more.

52
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,680
This was like the list I got.

53
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,020
So yeah.

54
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,280
It's gonna be very interesting.

55
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,480
I have played this game before.

56
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,620
They invited me before.

57
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,100
Almost the same group.

58
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,080
But I didn't stream my POV.

59
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,100
So today...

60
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,860
I am going to stream my POV.

61
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,540
Just cause I was like...

62
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,100
Fuck it.

63
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:42,420
You know?

64
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,000
Like...

65
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,560
I didn't stream a lot of my POVs during the other collabs I was invited with the Fleshtubers.

66
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:55,860
But today I feel like you guys don't need to play Worst Jokey Bird and try to find me in like 200 POVs.

67
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,280
Today I'll actually be there.

68
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:57,860
Like...

69
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,540
I'll actually be there.

70
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,000
Yeah.

71
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,820
Like I said...

72
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,220
I think this is a heavy roleplay.

73
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,200
This is gonna be a heavy office roleplay.

74
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:11,980
I don't know.

75
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:12,600
I'm not sure.

76
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,200
It really depends.

77
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,900
It's gonna be very difficult to figure out who this...

78
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,980
I don't wanna be the manager.

79
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,060
I feel like that's too much stress already.

80
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:19,960
Like I'm already CEO.

81
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,620
Like I'm already IRL director of my own company.

82
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,160
I don't...

83
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,960
I don't need to...

84
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,320
I don't need to...

85
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,780
I'm here...

86
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,620
I'm here to get away from that.

87
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,040
Like...

88
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,280
I wanna be an employee.

89
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,340
I wanna be an employee.

90
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,440
I don't...

91
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,200
I don't wanna be the manager.

92
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,220
I don't wanna live my life right now.

93
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,780
I don't need a roleplay.

94
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,660
I'm trying to run away from my problems here.

95
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,480
Not relive it.

96
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,440
Guys...

97
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,080
We're here to escape reality here.

98
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,820
That's what video games is for.

99
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,400
Dr. Cranberry.

100
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,320
Thank you for the super chat.

101
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:06,620
Thank you.

102
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,100
Thank you.

103
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,010
Doki is the slacker of her own company.

104
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,620
Thank you for the super chat.

105
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:10,920
Thank you.

106
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:11,340
Thank you.

107
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:17,560
I don't think the lobby is ready yet because like I'm looking at the Discord server and nobody's in it.

108
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:17,960
I don't know.

109
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:22,800
Maybe like it's another server that I'm not aware of because that would be very awkward if it is.

110
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,900
I hope it's not so...

111
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,360
I hope it's not another server that I wasn't aware of.

112
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:28,660
Like...

113
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,340
I'm gonna double check.

114
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:30,960
Okay.

115
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:31,220
No.

116
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:31,540
Okay.

117
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,780
Sykuna's playing Street Fighter.

118
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,180
Okay.

119
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:33,800
Okay.

120
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,160
That's good.

121
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:34,860
Um...

122
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,520
And I think like Chodo's watching a YouTube video.

123
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:37,960
Okay.

124
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,680
So that's good.

125
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,340
I'm not late.

126
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,220
Yeah.

127
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:40,580
Okay.

128
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,040
Good.

129
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:41,780
We're not late.

130
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:46,880
No.

131
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:47,260
No.

132
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:47,720
No.

133
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,360
No one...

134
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,320
It can't be.

135
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:49,580
No.

136
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,080
No.

137
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,240
I'm not in the wrong server.

138
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,200
There's nobody on the server.

139
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,080
There's no way.

140
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,980
Did I get the right time?

141
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:00,520
Yes.

142
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,320
I did.

143
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,360
They said 2 p.m.

144
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:03,780
Okay.

145
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,480
Oh my god.

146
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,760
Is it 2.30 p.m.?

147
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,840
Did I get the time wrong?

148
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:07,620
I need a double...

149
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,680
Don't do this to me, guys.

150
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,180
Now I'm second.

151
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,200
This is why I can't be the manager right now.

152
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:11,440
I'm...

153
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,240
No.

154
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,340
It is.

155
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:15,720
Okay.

156
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,220
You guys...

157
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:16,520
Okay.

158
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:16,880
Okay.

159
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,380
It is at 2 p.m.

160
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,220
PST.

161
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:25,500
It can't be any other time zone because PST is the latest out of all the NA time zone.

162
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,840
Unless you live in Alaska.

163
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,020
But like...

164
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,760
It can't be EST because if it's EST, I'm gonna die.

165
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,640
The collab would have already happened, chat.

166
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,900
If it was CST, the collab would have already happened.

167
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,640
So it has to be PST.

168
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,420
Oh, sorry.

169
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,860
I saw somebody said it was their birthday but they couldn't be here.

170
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,620
So we gotta wish them a happy birthday.

171
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,560
Hey.

172
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,800
Thank you for the super chat.

173
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,180
Thank you.

174
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,760
Thank you.

175
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,040
Hi, future Doki.

176
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:54,000
I won't be able to watch today's stream because of work but was hoping I would get a happy birthday.

177
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,280
Can't wait to watch the VOD later and laugh at your hijinks didn't true.

178
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,680
Thank you for the super chat.

179
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,040
Thank you.

180
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,640
Thank you.

181
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,300
Happy birthday to you.

182
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,880
If you're watching the VOD now, happy birthday to you.

183
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,040
Happy birthday, dear Haze.

184
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,440
Happy birthday to you.

185
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:09,980
Yeah!

186
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,260
It's the mandatory birthday celebration at the office.

187
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:15,820
Yeah.

188
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:20,760
Can everybody sign a card for Haze and I'll chip in like $1.

189
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,200
We all chip in for $1.

190
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,580
We can buy him a cake.

191
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,560
I also know about that.

192
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:28,820
But yeah.

193
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,840
I'm really nervous.

194
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:31,620
I always get nervous.

195
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,620
I get super nervous in a big group of people.

196
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:40,680
And like a lot of them are like really, really big streamers too.

197
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,560
So yeah.

198
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,940
I'm like super, I'm super duper nervous in general.

199
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,440
Like I'm okay.

200
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,540
Like during like...

201
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,820
Thank you all for chipping in.

202
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:01,260
Thank you Normal and Ruji for chipping into the birthday cake for Haze's birthday cake.

203
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,240
Thank you for the super chat.

204
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:02,640
Thank you.

205
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,260
Thank you.

206
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,040
So I'm super nervous.

207
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,640
Guys, some of them have been in movies, guys.

208
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,300
Some of them have been in movies, guys.

209
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,360
I'm just...

210
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,040
I'm just a VTuber.

211
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,600
So I am like off-stream...

212
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,760
Like when I'm not doing these...

213
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:29,580
When I'm doing these collabs off-stream, it's less nerve-wracking because like you guys don't get...

214
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,240
You guys don't watch me fuck.

215
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:31,580
You guys don't watch me fumble.

216
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,680
Like spill my spaghetti all over the place.

217
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,900
And like there's less eyes on me when it's happening.

218
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,680
But now that I'm also streaming, I'm like...

219
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,280
It's okay.

220
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,500
It's my first 9 to 5...

221
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:50,600
Okay.

222
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,360
No, it's not my first 9 to 5 job.

223
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,680
But it's my first 9 to 5 office job.

224
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,140
So like we all get one.

225
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,540
We all get one...

226
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,600
You know what?

227
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,660
We all get one chance to fuck up working at an office.

228
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,960
So it'll be okay.

229
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,060
Like we're selling paper.

230
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,380
Like how hard can it be?

231
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,780
We're literally selling paper.

232
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,600
Let's see.

233
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,460
Troll, thank you for the super chat.

234
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,300
Thank you, thank you.

235
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,780
Nothing but love for the punctual like a CEO and trolling queen deal-keeper.

236
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:23,720
This would be awesome.

237
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,260
Keep calm.

238
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,280
Thank you for the super chat.

239
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,240
Thank you, thank you.

240
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,260
I really appreciate them inviting me though.

241
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,960
I was very surprised that they...

242
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,460
sent me an invite.

243
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,000
Because I'm like, me?

244
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,900
Am I funny enough?

245
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,320
Me?

246
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,480
So yeah.

247
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,500
I really do appreciate that they invited me to join this collab.

248
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,380
Oh yeah.

249
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,880
Can't be any worse than yesterday.

250
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,940
Die via buzz sauce.

251
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,160
Hey.

252
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,560
It molded us.

253
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,000
Okay.

254
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,520
Like we went straight to level 15.

255
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,100
And we got past level 15.

256
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:06,340
Okay.

257
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,420
We did stage one of level 15.

258
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,520
We can do anything now.

259
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:18,160
Most likely part two of that collab, by the way, will be on the week of October.

260
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,780
Because a lot of the other girls will be busy next week.

261
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,440
So we decided to make it on the first week of October.

262
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,440
So it won't be next week.

263
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:34,760
By the way, most likely next week will be like mostly solo streams.

264
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,900
Because I had two big like collab streams.

265
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,980
I had two big collab streams this week.

266
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,820
So like I'm gonna recharge my battery.

267
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:45,760
Unless like...

268
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,900
Unless LM invited me to a collab.

269
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:48,700
Then maybe...

270
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,200
Look guys.

271
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,660
I'm trying to make friends.

272
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,080
Okay.

273
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,420
I'm trying my best.

274
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,120
Okay.

275
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,020
It's time for me to make new friends.

276
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:02,880
Just...

277
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,440
I'm just trying to make new friends and expand my network guys.

278
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,200
I'm always super nervous about it.

279
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,200
Because I'm like...

280
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,100
I'm like...

281
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,200
I don't know what I'm doing.

282
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:20,760
Okay.

283
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,100
I'm gonna double check.

284
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,200
If people are in the void.

285
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,340
No, people are not in...

286
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,420
What do people do when they...

287
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:30,600
Is...

288
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:30,900
Is...

289
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,640
I...

290
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:31,840
I...

291
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,860
I'm so not used to like starting a collab stream.

292
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,720
And just being alone.

293
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,740
At the beginning.

294
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,580
I'm not used to that.

295
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,060
I'm just like...

296
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:44,860
What do I...

297
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,240
Do I just talk until...

298
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,360
What do I...

299
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,880
What do I do?

300
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,080
Just...

301
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:52,380
There...

302
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,320
There...

303
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,080
There...

304
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,660
And then I call?

305
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,080
Are you...

306
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,340
Wait.

307
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,340
Are you serious?

308
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,160
Okay.

309
00:12:59,460 --> 00:12:59,700
I...

310
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,060
I...

311
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:00,660
What?

312
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,420
What server are they on?

313
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,520
Wait.

314
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,140
What?

315
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,680
I...

316
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,580
I'm late?

317
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,480
I'm actually late.

318
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,020
Oh.

319
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,280
There's no way.

320
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,640
There's no way I'm fucking...

321
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,440
Oh my god.

322
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,000
Okay.

323
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:18,960
Okay.

324
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,380
I might be...

325
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,000
I might be late guys.

326
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,540
I might...

327
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,320
I might...

328
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,040
I might be...

329
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,100
What server are they on?

330
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,420
What?

331
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,600
What the fuck?

332
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,860
I was late?

333
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,140
Two, four...

334
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:38,240
No.

335
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:38,760
I'm not.

336
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,960
I'm not late.

337
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,080
There's people missing.

338
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,440
Literally, there's people...

339
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,300
Literally.

340
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:45,620
Literally.

341
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,900
Jodo's not even in here.

342
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,780
And he's the one that organized this collab.

343
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,200
I'm not late.

344
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,340
I'm...

345
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,820
Jodo organized this collab.

346
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,020
I'm not...

347
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,340
He's not even here.

348
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,080
Oh my god.

349
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,260
Okay.

350
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,420
Okay.

351
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:05,940
That's good.

352
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,060
Let's...

353
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:07,240
Oh.

354
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,800
I can't show the screen because, like, it has the code, guys.

355
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,900
I can't show...

356
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,640
Wait.

357
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,080
How do I...

358
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,420
This...

359
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,700
How do I not show the code?

360
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,400
Oh no.

361
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,560
How do I block the...

362
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:18,820
Oh.

363
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,880
This is why...

364
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,280
This is why I don't stream these two.

365
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:22,880
Oh.

366
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:23,440
Oh.

367
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,000
Oh.

368
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,240
I'm already up just in case.

369
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,680
Oh my god.

370
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,540
Oh my...

371
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,860
I can't believe I was late.

372
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:32,800
I was so...

373
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,320
I was confused.

374
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,260

Thank you.

378
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:36,520
Thank you.

379
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,480
There's another server?

380
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:38,500
Okay.

381
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:38,880
That'll be...

382
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,880
I'll message...

383
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,960
I'll message Jodo.

384
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,580
It'll be late.

385
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,640
What the...

386
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,800
Screen server.

387
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,980
Are you guys in...

388
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:47,100
Oh.

389
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:47,780
Streamer mode.

390
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,680
There's a streamer mode.

391
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,540
I thought...

392
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,860
I thought it was...

393
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,000
I didn't realize.

394
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:55,940
There was more than one.

395
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,400
I'm new here.

396
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:58,320
I...

397
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:01,540
Okay.

398
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,060
Can I like...

399
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:03,480
Leave?

400
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,320
I can't leave?

401
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,440
How do I...

402
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:07,800
Oh.

403
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,040
Okay.

404
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:08,380
There we go.

405
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:08,800
Settings.

406
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,660
I'm going to put streamer mode just in case.

407
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:11,720
Okay.

408
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:12,620
Oh.

409
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,080
No.

410
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,260
I reset everything.

411
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:14,880
Okay.

412
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:15,820
No.

413
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,260
Did I reset everything?

414
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:22,680
I accidentally reset everything.

415
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,060
Oh.

416
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:24,560
Oh.

417
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,000
Oh.

418
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:25,420
Okay.

419
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,940
Push to talk.

420
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,520
Okay.

421
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,120
Device.

422
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,180
Microphone device.

423
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:31,860
Okay.

424
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,380
Guys.

425
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,280
Guys.

426
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:33,580
It's...

427
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,080
It's fine.

428
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,480
It's...

429
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,000
It's fine.

430
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,860
Everything is fine.

431
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,600
Everything is okay.

432
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,700
Okay.

433
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,920
I think...

434
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,280
I think I'm in the...

435
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,620
What is device one, two, three?

436
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,500
Oh.

437
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,140
Oh.

438
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:54,160
Oh.

439
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:54,340
Oh.

440
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:54,520
Oh.

441
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:55,800
I don't know.

442
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,840
I hope device two is the right device.

443
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:01,740
I don't...

444
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,920
I literally don't know.

445
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,180
Okay.

446
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:06,820
Okay.

447
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,200
Let me see if it works.

448
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:08,760
Oh.

449
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,440
It's hidden.

450
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:09,880
Nice.

451
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,240
Okay.

452
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,000
It's hidden now.

453
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:11,420
All right.

454
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:11,900
We're fine.

455
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:12,880
Everything is fine.

456
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,440
I mess...

457
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,060
At message.

458
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,800
What's the Discord server we're on?

459
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,780
And nobody said...

460
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,660
And like...

461
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,860
I haven't got a response yet.

462
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,380
So we'll see.

463
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,300
Okay.

464
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:22,680
Doki.

465
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,320
It's Thursday.

466
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,700
The cloud was yesterday.

467
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,000
Yesterday.

468
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,020
You missed it.

469
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:26,720
Farina.

470
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,960

471
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:28,460
Thank you.

472
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,100
Thank you.

473
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,120
Okay.

474
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,020
It's fine.

475
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:31,560
We're...

476
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,040
We're fine.

477
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:32,860
We...

478
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,680
I don't know what server we're in.

479
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,040
But...

480
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,720
What server everybody else is in.

481
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,400
But like...

482
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,160
That's fine.

483
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,740
I'll just talk in the office.

484
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:41,640
All right.

485
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:46,500
Hey.

486
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:47,980

487
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,320
I'll just talk...

488
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,840
I'll just talk in the game.

489
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:51,580
I'll just...

490
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,980

00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:58,940
Yeah.

495
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,080
There's proximity voice chat, anyway.

496
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,160
It's okay.

497
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,520
We're missing...

498
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,260
We're missing like.

499
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,020
We're missing people.

00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:07,660
Yeah.

501
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,320
We are.

502
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,020
This can't be all of them.

503
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,260
We're missing...

504
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:11,460
Yeah.

505
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,680
We're missing people.

506
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,200
Um...

507
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,580
We can't write a message.

508
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,220
Okay.

509
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:18,740
I'll just...

510
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,120

00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,160
I don't want to be like hey.

512
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:20,440

513
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,000
That's good.

514
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,300
Because then people be like.

00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:22,720
Oh.

516
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,420
Oh, she's the new hire.

517
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,380
What if they hate me?

518
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,980
I don't want to be... they're like, oh, fresh me.

519
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,480
I don't want to say like, hey guys, what servers are we?

520
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:51,440
Nobody told me... I don't see anybody in the server that's usually...

521
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,200
as with the collabs.

522
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,240
Oh, I got an invite.

523
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:57,900
Let's go.

524
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:01,400
It's called... oh my god, it's the friend server.

525
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:02,960
Oh my god, I'm in.

526
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,780
I'm spilling my spaghetti already.

527
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:12,140
I'm spilling my spaghetti already.

528
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:16,640
I told you guys, when I'm on the stream, it's worse for me.

529
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,920
Okay, I need...

530
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,100
I'm gonna do push to mute.

531
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,040
I can't.

532
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,840
I'm gonna do push to mute.

533
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,040
I can't, guys.

534
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,240
Okay, what's the... what is my key button for mute?

535
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:42,780
I don't... I don't usually do mute, so I don't know.

536
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,100
Okay.

537
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,280
Okay, this is fine.

538
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:47,700
All right.

539
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:52,960
Push to talk.

540
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,120
I haven't joined yet, because I'm like, nervous.

541
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:00,740
Devastated.

542
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,580
Oh, you're gonna get the wood cream back out.

543
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,640
No, no, no.

544
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,520
Well, actually, the wood cream does protect it from messes like these, you know.

545
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,180
And you cause a lot of those.

546
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,100
I do.

547
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,560
Well, actually, what started it all was last night.

548
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,740
I accidentally filled...

549
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:17,200
Guys, I... I pushed the top, so I'm trying to get the overlay...

550
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:17,900
Overlay, correct.

551
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,000
...button tower, whatever.

552
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:19,760
I don't know what it's called.

553
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:20,600
But...

554
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,460
You need a bib!

555
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,320
What is it?

556
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,240
Because this happens too often.

557
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,640
Guys, Lily is coming.

558
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,280
Yay!

559
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,560
Hi, Lily.

560
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:29,540
Nice!

561
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,400
Where's the friends?

562
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,220
Oh, my God.

563
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:32,800
Another one.

564
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,800
Janet, you're here.

565
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,300
You made it.

566
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:39,360
I'm here, and I'm not technically late is what I'm hearing, because somebody else is joining after me.

567
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:39,640
Woo!

568
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,780
That's what I like to say.

569
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,460
You're funny.

570
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,900
No, no.

571
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:53,700
I think you're still late, but I mean, you should have just said let's pin the blame on, you know, the people that aren't here.

572
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,340
Oh, boy.

573
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,500
There you go.

574
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:56,880
Oh, boy.

575
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,560
Sorry, I was trying to figure it out.

576
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,380
I'm so nervous.

577
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,200
That's why you're a goddamn genius.

578
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,400
For what?

579
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:05,500
Thank you.

580
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:11,680
And for my first act, I'm banning Ellum from everyone's chat.

581
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,900
Are you ready to ban from everyone's chats?

582
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,900
I haven't seen him type in my chat in a hot minute.

583
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,480
I can't lie.

584
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,720
I feel like he might be banned.

585
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,480
Wait, what?

586
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,240
Why is he banned?

587
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,000
Slash unbanned Ellum.

588
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:22,980
No.

589
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:23,600
Oh, God.

590
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,180
Wait, Janet's in this lobby?

591
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:26,460
Yeah.

592
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,160
Oh.

593
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,140
Wait, Janet's late.

594
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:30,620
That's like a weird...

595
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,560
He's not banned in my channel.

596
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,320
I'm gonna ban him.

597
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:33,780
Hi, Janet.

598
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:34,860
What did...

599
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,700
Hi, Shoto.

600
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:36,440
Oh, my God.

601
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,080
Where did he go?

602
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,280
He's not even here to defend himself.

603
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,400
Wait, what did Ellum even do to get banned?

604
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,400
Oh.

605
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:43,880
Oh, my God.

606
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,340
Where did we fucking start?

607
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,100
Where did we start?

608
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:46,680
Honestly.

609
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,400
What did...

610
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,040
He nods.

611
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,460
He was the best.

612
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,000
Oh, could I...

613
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,220
He nodded to the lobby.

614
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,240
Oh.

615
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,940
Maybe I can invite?

616
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:53,680
Or I don't know.

617
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:54,820
Oh, my God.

618
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,540
I'm so nervous.

619
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,440
Can you guys hear me?

620
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,520
Oh, yes.

621
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:57,720
Hello.

622
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,120
Why are you here?

623
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,300
Why are you here?

624
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,700
Are you...

625
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,360
Oh.

626
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:04,880
Oh.

627
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,100
Oh.

628
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:06,340
Wait.

629
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,540
What do you mean shock?

630
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,400
Well, see.

631
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,080
Dakken was a hot commodity last time we played this.

632
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:13,760
I caught him.

633
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,860
I'm sitting on the toilet.

634
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,620
Okay.

635
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:15,660
Oh.

636
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,140
What?

637
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,000
Listen.

638
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,040
Chat highly requested Dakken.

639
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,220
He does that.

640
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,080
He does that.

641
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,260
You watch out for him.

642
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,740
He's wishy-washy, man.

643
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:27,360
Oh.

644
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,180
Dakken.

645
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:28,760
Okay.

646
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,220
That is great.

647
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,220
Listen.

648
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,960
I'm reformed.

649
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,680
I'm reformed.

650
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,280
Come on.

651
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:33,840
Reformed.

652
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,420
No.

653
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:34,680
No.

654
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,260
That's not right.

655
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:35,480
Yeah.

656
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,900
I'm standing on Benins.

657
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,120
You're toxic?

658
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,200
I'm toxic?

659
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,120
He's toxic.

660
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,540
He's toxic as heck.

661
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:41,980
He's toxic.

662
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,000
He's toxic as heck.

663
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,540
I'm not joking around.

664
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:44,880
I'm not joking around.

665
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,320
I'm just...

666
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,020
He did not joke around.

667
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,260
You're just being... fuckboy.

668
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:48,560
Oh.

669
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:49,700
What?

670
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:50,540
Yes.

671
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,220
Exactly.

672
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:51,920
Thank you.

673
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,220
You're just kicking them right now.

674
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,100
I can just kick them.

675
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,680
We don't have to play with them.

676
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,520
I joined for 10 seconds and I get attacked already.

677
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:00,400
What is going on?

678
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:01,820
Doki.

679
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,060
Doki.

680
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:02,580
Hello.

681
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:02,920
Hello.

682
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,240
Hello.

683
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,380
Hello, everybody.

684
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,240
Doki.

685
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:05,580
Doki.

686
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:05,960
Doki.

687
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:06,780
Doki.

688
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:11,520
Doki.

689
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:11,620
Hello, Doki.

690
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:11,800
Oh, did you say Lily or Shy Lilly?

691
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,500
Lily or Shy Lilly?

692
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,800
I'm Shai.

693
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,500
I'm so shy.

694
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,220
Why do you know that she's on a plane specifically?

695
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,640
She's on a plane.

696
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:29,980
She's crazy.

697
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,160
Shoto Docs that she's on a plane.

698
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,160
That's crazy.

699
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,620
It's all my God.

700
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,300
Everybody, meet and greet at the airport.

701
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,880
A day ago or something.

702
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,360
Oh my god.

703
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,400
Perfectly, right?

704
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,520
Like, when she's gonna land...

705
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,080
Yo, just say the flight number, Shoto.

706
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:47,680
Like, seriously.

707
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,260
Yeah, yeah, just give us the flight number, destination.

708
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,600
Stupid as ever.

709
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,220
Springfield!

710
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,140
Alright, I'll bring Shoto up.

711
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,580
Yeah, we're going back to my home route.

712
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,680
What are the odds?

713
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,540
Well, not exactly Springfield, but Ohio!

714
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,960
Um, okay, Daka needs to ready.

715
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,420
Ray needs to ready.

716
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,840
Or can I just ready ourselves?

717
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,120
Oh, we all ready.

718
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,440
Is everyone in this call here?

719
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:19,640
Everyone in the... Oh, it is in-game voice, by the way.

720
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

721
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,800
Yeah, so we mute ourselves here.

722
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:22,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

723
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,700
Oh, yeah, Shoto, I forgot you haven't played.

724
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,020
You guys should have played the tutorial.

725
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,280
Tutorial Pistorio.

726
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:35,180
There's just one thing you guys have to know for the newbies.

727
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,480
Um, so...

728
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:42,900
So, even if you are the neutral type, you still have to do the bad quest in order to do the good quest.

729
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:48,680
So, I know it's like, you're gonna try to want to avoid the slacker quest, but you have to do it to do the next ones.

730
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,340
That's all you need to know.

731
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,880
So, I do all my quests.

732
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,200
Okay.

733
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,360
Yeah, yeah, you have to do all of it.

734
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:53,880
Sorry.

735
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:54,780
Oh!

736
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,700
Wow, just on time!

737
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,120
We made it.

738
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:56,400
Hello.

739
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,200
Oh, my God.

740
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,500
How Street Fighter?

741
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,100
Bro, I'm gonna watch you compete.

742
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,300
I'm gonna watch you.

743
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:03,820
Shit.

744
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:06,220
Bro, I'm like not eating properly.

745
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,060
Oh, no!

746
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,040
I respect the grind.

747
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,460
I just messaged her that.

748
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:11,880
Oh, thank you.

749
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,180
I heard her.

750
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,000
She's in the game.

751
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,400
Fears the Fathom, Episode 5.

752
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,880
Bro, you killed me twice, by the way.

753
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,440
I hate that.

754
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,880
Oh, Lily's here.

755
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,020
Fucking Nora.

756
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,880
Dude, Nora.

757
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,020
Yeah.

758
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:23,960
God damn it, Nora.

759
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:24,240
Oh, God.

760
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:24,740
Okay.

761
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:29,200
I'm gonna take a break from Street Fighter and play this nice little Dawn and Dawson game.

762
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:29,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

763
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,100
I recommend it to Ray.

764
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,040
I think Ray was the only one that did the tutorial.

765
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:36,200
I think Ray was the only one that did the tutorial.

766
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,560
Out of all of us.

767
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:39,900
Yeah.

768
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,140
There's a lot of new people here today.

769
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,300
That's so fair.

770
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:43,740
It's gonna be fun.

771
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,000
Alright, I'm ready for the...

772
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,240
Wait.

773
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,520
Gianna, you banned me?

774
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,420
Oh, my God.

775
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,060
There's so many.

776
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,620
Why is there so many people in this call?

777
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,460
Someone invite Lily.

778
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,580
He does deserve it.

779
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,920
Oh, my God.

780
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,840
It's a whole line.

781
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,140
It's a conga line.

782
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,120
It don't even fit on my screen anymore.

783
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,580
It's toxic.

784
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,180
Oh, my God.

785
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,500
I would never tell you.

786
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,220
The sky is...

787
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,360
It's a conga line.

788
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,100
Why are you making it like that?

789
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,640
He's literally...

790
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,600
What the fuck?

791
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,840
It's a high score line.

792
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,560
I'm like the exchange student.

793
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:21,680
Yes.

794
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,320
But where...

795
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,180
I thought Sakuna was coming.

796
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:26,700
Where is he?

797
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,780
He's in the game.

798
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,360
He's in the game.

799
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:28,860
Oh, he's in...

800
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,280
Okay, okay.

801
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:29,640
Alright.

802
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:30,620
Alright.

803
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,400
Ready up, Tina.

804
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,880
You sending me a pigeon...

805
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,300
A gif of a pigeon jumping.

806
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,160
Oh, my God.

807
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,300
This is crazy.

808
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,460
That is crazy.

809
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,460
So he's in the camera.

810
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:41,840
Oh, my God.

811
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,880
I just like the actual, you know.

812
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:46,220
Like send it to me when it's awkward as well.

813
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:47,400
Oh, my God.

814
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,640
And then he said, actually, though.

815
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,160
Oh, my God.

816
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:50,820
Oh, you're ready up, Tina.

817
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,040
Oh, me?

818
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:52,760
Oh, sorry.

819
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:53,800
Oh, yeah.

820
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,000
Okay.

821
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,500
Me, myself here.

822
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,400
Yeah.

823
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:56,900
Well, yeah.

824
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,620
It's in-game voice.

825
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,240
In-game voice.

826
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:58,980
In-game voice.

827
00:25:58,980 --> 00:25:59,240
In-game voice.

828
00:25:59,240 --> 00:25:59,400
Oh, really?

829
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:00,620
Yeah, yeah.

830
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,180
You are...

831
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:01,960
Oh, ho, ho.

832
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:02,980
I made my life...

833
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:03,500
Oh, my God.

834
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:03,760
Okay.

835
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

836
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:06,760
I can be social.

837
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,300
I can interact with other people.

838
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,160
Oh, my God.

839
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,380
I can just laugh.

840
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:12,560
Whoa.

841
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,940
Somebody's echoing.

842
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,360
Oh, no.

843
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,060
It's probably Shoto.

844
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,220
Shoto's always echoing.

845
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:20,540
It's Shoto.

846
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:20,840
It's Shoto.

847
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,580
It's 100% Shoto.

848
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,500
You bastard.

849
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,500
Oh, foolish.

850
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,380
I'm going to laugh.

851
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:26,840
No.

852
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:27,640
No.

853
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,520
I didn't mean to do that.

854
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,120
I don't know.

855
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,500
I don't think it's me.

856
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,040
I didn't mean to.

857
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:34,980
I pressed the wrong button.

858
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:35,240
Oh, yeah.

859
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,020
Oh, yeah.

860
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:36,160
I didn't mean to.

861
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:36,540
Oh.

862
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,580
He's just faking me.

863
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:40,540
Wait.

864
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,500
I'm new here.

865
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:43,020
I got...

866
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:43,980
What's our work?

867
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:45,860
Wait.

868
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,540
I'm not echoing.

869
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,100
I'm fine.

870
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,020
Is it me?

871
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,940
Is it me?

872
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,420
Is it...

873
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,540
I don't know if device too.

874
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,020
Is that...

875
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,340
What is my device?

876
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,220
Okay.

877
00:26:59,260 --> 00:26:59,480
Wait.

878
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,120
Who's echoing?

879
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:00,480
Is it me?

880
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,340
Am I echoing?

881
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:02,840
Oh.

882
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,080
Did someone unlock this door?

883
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,800
Can you please open the door, Mr. Manager?

884
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,060
Oh.

885
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:06,080
Oh.

886
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,120
Oh.

887
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:06,160
Oh.

888
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:06,240
Here we go.

889
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,000
I unlocked it.

890
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:07,600
I unlocked it.

891
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,340
Oh, nice.

892
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:09,440
Okay.

893
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,460
Where's my desk?

894
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:11,780
Where is it?

895
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,760
Does anyone know where my desk is?

896
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,360
Oh.

897
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:16,560
Hello.

898
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,160
Nice to meet you.

899
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,080
I just got hired.

900
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:22,580
Oh.

901
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:22,960
Good to...

902
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,200
Hello.

903
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:23,960
Good to meet you, too.

904
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:24,260
Yeah.

905
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:25,260
Oh.

906
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:25,700
Wait.

907
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,100
I forgot...

908
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:26,800
Whoa.

909
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:28,980
Is that...

910
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,580
Is that office practices here?

911
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:33,400
Oh.

912
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:33,800
Okay.

913
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,180
Oh.

914
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:34,480
Oh.

915
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:36,740
There we go.

916
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,000
Yeah.

917
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:39,480
We need a meeting.

918
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,240
I realized I was the one that was echoing.

919
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,160
Okay.

920
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:42,240
Oh.

921
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:42,560
Nice.

922
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,120
Oh.

923
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:43,400
Okay.

924
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:43,640
Okay.

925
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,020
I got it.

926
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:44,440
Oh.

927
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:44,660
Wow.

928
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,020
All right.

929
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,220
All right.

930
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,280
I'm going to turn up the game.

931
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:47,700
Yeah.

932
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,400
There we go.

933
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,640
Who gets locked in the door?

934
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:51,580
Okay.

935
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,100
Is that better, guys?

936
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,160
No.

937
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:56,380
No.

938
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:56,540
No.

939
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:56,600
No.

940
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:56,640
No.

941
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:57,380
No.

942
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:57,760
No.

943
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:06,940
Okay.

944
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,840
I know it's chaotic right now, but I think HR's...

945
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,300
I'm sorry.

946
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:12,700
I'm sorry.

947
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,160
I also...

948
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:13,520
All right.

949
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,140
Is it better now?

950
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,540
I just wanted to talk big to intimidate you and...

951
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:16,920
Dude.

952
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,540
That's my only...

953
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:17,760
Okay.

954
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,240
Listen.

955
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,320
I'll be honest.

956
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,640
Someone's going to need to get fired.

957
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:20,960
Okay?

958
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:21,640
Wait.

959
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,760
But we have a minute left.

960
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:23,840
Yeah.

961
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:28,040
We got to figure this out or else I get fired and I don't want to do that.

962
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:28,420
I love my job.

963
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,660
I think you're a good manager.

964
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,100
I think he sucks.

965
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:31,460
Wait.

966
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:31,560
What?

967
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,380
It was...

968
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:32,820
Oh.

969
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:33,740
Oh.

970
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,180
Okay.

971
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:35,720
You're so good at this.

972
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:36,720
Dude.

973
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:36,860
That was dessert.

974
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,500
Oh, my gosh.

975
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,100
That was dessert.

976
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,180
That was dessert.

977
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:39,980
Guys, cheese.

978
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:40,820
You're a jerk.

979
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,260
You're a jerk.

980
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,440
I told you how...

981
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:43,940
Oh!

982
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,320
Oh!

983
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,820
Oh, Elem was the slacker.

984
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,100
All right.

985
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,600
You'll do great in your new janitor position.

986
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,820
Dude, Elem, you're so bad.

987
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:52,760
Hi.

988
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,460
We already discovered us a slacker, Elem.

989
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,280
All right, guys.

990
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,360
Jump shop, okay?

991
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,480
I don't pay you by the hour.

992
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,480
Get back to work.

993
00:28:59,480 --> 00:28:59,640
I'm ready.

994
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,500
No, please.

995
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,620
What do I have to do?

996
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,360
I have to use my computer.

997
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,460
Where the fuck is my computer?

998
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:04,740
Okay.

999
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:05,480
Computer?

1000
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,380
Alright.

1001
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,260
Guys, we're gonna learn how to work in an office.

1002
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:12,060
Okay, I gotta order a mouse.

1003
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:15,720
Okay, uh... Inventory.

1004
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:17,820
Mouse.

1005
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,620
Paper.

1006
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,160
Papering.

1007
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,360
Okay.

1008
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,660
Nice, I did it!

1009
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,160
Okay.

1010
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,720
We need to do as many tasks, specialist tasks, to outdo the slacker tasks.

1011
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,320
I'm getting them all done, don't even worry about it!

1012
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,700
I need to shake hands with somebody.

1013
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:35,800
I'm here.

1014
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,720
Who do I shake hands with?

1015
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,200
Oh, Tina, hello!

1016
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,360
My name is Doki.

1017
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,980
It's very nice to meet you, I gotta shake your hand.

1018
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,600
Hi, Doki!

1019
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,260
Can I shake your hand, please?

1020
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,040
No, I'm sorry!

1021
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,780
Oh, thank you.

1022
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,020
Sorry, sorry, I lived inside for 20 years.

1023
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,500
So, my social interaction is not great.

1024
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,420
Does anyone know where Blau's office is?

1025
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,260
Where's the paper?

1026
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,820
Oh, my God.

1027
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,080
Okay, there you go.

1028
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:12,300
Guys, I don't know how to interact socially anymore, guys.

1029
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,940
I don't know how to interact with people anymore.

1030
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,600
I was a very sheltered child.

1031
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,800
A very sheltered child.

1032
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:32,160
Okay, I did my new task.

1033
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,580
Okay, you know what?

1034
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,540
I deserve something.

1035
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,080
I deserve something.

1036
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,640
Oh, where's the kitchen?

1037
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,840
Where's the kitchen?

1038
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,300
Why is this office so big?

1039
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,940
Oh, thank God.

1040
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:43,620
Okay.

1041
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,800
Wait, how does... why does that make sense?

1042
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,880
Alright, you guys wanna... does anyone drink with me?

1043
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,200
You're catching the slackers.

1044
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,620
Guys, today was a hard day of work.

1045
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,000
Yeah, I played Street Fighter for 10 hours.

1046
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,020
Yeah, you need a drink.

1047
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,020
It's alright.

1048
00:30:59,040 --> 00:30:59,700
It's only 2 p.m.

1049
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,380
We all need a drink here.

1050
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,620
Did I stutter?

1051
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:04,260
Yeah.

1052
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,160
Like, who no drink with us?

1053
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,080
I feel like it's only 2 p.m., right?

1054
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,100
I can't wait till Saturday's over.

1055
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,420
It's just pre-drinking.

1056
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,340
At worst, you get second place.

1057
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:16,900
I know, but no one...

1058
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,420
Hey, who remembers second place?

1059
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:20,840
You do.

1060
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,820
You will always remember second place for the rest of your life.

1061
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,540
Yeah, cause she's gonna be in second place.

1062
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:25,900
Yeah!

1063
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,480
You're winning, right?

1064
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:26,880
Don't you?

1065
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,620
Yeah, exactly!

1066
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,000
Am I right?

1067
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,620
Wait, what?

1068
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,320
Wait, guys, the meeting!

1069
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:34,880
The meeting!

1070
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,300
Oh, cause we're drunk on work.

1071
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,780
Oh, the meeting, guys!

1072
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,000
We have to go to the meeting!

1073
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:41,620
I mean, I'm glad you don't say anything, right?

1074
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,560
Maybe we don't have to care about that.

1075
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,660
I need to speak to the manager.

1076
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:46,160
That's true.

1077
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:46,760
We don't...

1078
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,480
What are you gonna do?

1079
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,280
Fire us if we don't show up?

1080
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,260
There's so many of us.

1081
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,100
They can't keep count.

1082
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:52,960
I made it.

1083
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:53,380
I made it.

1084
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,320
Everyone's lost.

1085
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,300
It's a new place.

1086
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:55,680
Thank you.

1087
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:55,840
Thank you.

1088
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:55,920
Thank you.

1089
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,260
Yeah, this looks good.

1090
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,540
You have really cool glasses.

1091
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,320
I trust you.

1092
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,280
You're a slacker.

1093
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,400
I'm sitting down.

1094
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,320
Oh, you're asking me who the slacker is?

1095
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:02,860
I'm sitting down.

1096
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,360
Who said I was sitting?

1097
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,320
Thank you, sorry!

1098
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:07,840
I was late!

1099
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:08,740
My bad.

1100
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,540
That's a lie.

1101
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,360
You guys are so late to the meeting.

1102
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,120
Alright.

1103
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,720
Well, then, I guess I have no choice.

1104
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:14,740
I guess I have no choice.

1105
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:15,280
Oh!

1106
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,380
He was the person.

1107
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,540
He was the person.

1108
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,060
Good job.

1109
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:21,900
Good job, manager.

1110
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:22,600
Good job.

1111
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,060
Very good.

1112
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:23,900
Very good.

1113
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:34,440
Wait, what do I do?

1114
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,220
Report relay.

1115
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,780
Use my computer again?

1116
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,240
Alright, let's see.

1117
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,860
Print the sales report.

1118
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,140
Use my computer.

1119
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,900
No, no connection!

1120
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,860
How am I supposed to do my job and pay for my family?

1121
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,120
What are you yelling for?

1122
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,160
There's no connection to the server, Tina!

1123
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,180
Oh, okay.

1124
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,400
Oh, there you go.

1125
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,000
Oh, yes!

1126
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,260
Yay!

1127
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,140
Complaining works!

1128
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,340
Inventory.

1129
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,840
Pick up sales confirmation.

1130
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,920
Print the sales confirmation.

1131
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,000
Okay.

1132
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,120
Alright, I'm printing.

1133
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,520
Is this what?

1134
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,160
Is this real?

1135
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:26,720
Is this real?

1136
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,580
Is this what you have to go through every day?

1137
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,120
Chat?

1138
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,440
The super chat me?

1139
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,280
I'm so sorry.

1140
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,780
I'm so sorry.

1141
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,360
Okay.

1142
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,140
I need to pick up the sales confirmation.

1143
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,480
Oh, financials!

1144
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,920
Okay, I can organize this right now.

1145
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,020
Grab.

1146
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,500
Oh, this is the sales confirmation!

1147
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:42,860
Wait!

1148
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,040
That's from a book!

1149
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,560
I printed it!

1150
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:45,980
It's out!

1151
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,180
This is...

1152
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,340
Well, well, well.

1153
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,340
Hello, Ellen.

1154
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,740
Look who it is.

1155
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,480
Look who got demoted and fired.

1156
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,300
Oh, the cigarettes.

1157
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,900
So you're saying I'm beneath you right now is what you're trying to say?

1158
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,360
I mean, in the hierarchy, yeah.

1159
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:58,600
Woah!

1160
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:00,340
That's right.

1161
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:00,560
That's right.

1162
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,500
Oh, you weren't meant to...

1163
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,040
Woah!

1164
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:03,500
Wait!

1165
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:03,900
Wait!

1166
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,420
Hey, suck it up.

1167
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:06,840
Someone clearly didn't go to sensitivity training.

1168
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,000
Take a little puff, man.

1169
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:08,460
Take a little puff.

1170
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,620
Okay, I need Foolish to write this.

1171
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:12,740
Where's the boss?

1172
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:14,880
Where's the boss?

1173
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,340
Yeah, no, there's not too much.

1174
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:16,600
Excuse me.

1175
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,260
Oh, where's...

1176
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,800
There's not too much for you in the game.

1177
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,980
You can't just do your tasks and think about winning.

1178
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:21,260
Okay.

1179
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:21,440
Okay.

1180
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,160
Uh, manager?

1181
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,620
I need you to sign this quarterly report.

1182
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1183
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,600
Okay, you're done for, pal.

1184
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,420
This is your last day.

1185
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,480
I'm being harassed!

1186
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,060
Why are you smoking inside that's been banned for years?

1187
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:36,540
Oh, thank you.

1188
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,200
Thank you, sir.

1189
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,620
Oh, here's a slap for good luck.

1190
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,240
I'm being harassed.

1191
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:43,920
I'm being harassed.

1192
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:45,980
Okay.

1193
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,400
Everything is about to start.

1194
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,340
Where's... where's the bulletin board?

1195
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:49,980
No, please!

1196
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,240
I just got the report!

1197
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:54,640
It cleansed... it bled my report!

1198
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,920
These are all believable things.

1199
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:56,600
No!

1200
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,580
Neon's innocent.

1201
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:58,540
No!

1202
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,520
Is she innocent?

1203
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,040
I helped her do her tasks.

1204
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:01,580
I helped her do her tasks.

1205
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:02,340
I helped her do her tasks.

1206
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,120
I helped her do her tasks.

1207
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:03,960
I helped her do her tasks.

1208
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,460
I helped her do her tasks.

1209
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,980
I helped her do her tasks.

1210
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:10,960
I was doing my tasks and she kept asking me about the... about my kids.

1211
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,800
I wasn't slacking.

1212
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:18,420
I was literally... I literally saw in your emails that they were asking for 20 extra boxes of paper.

1213
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,040
You're gonna have to do the hard job no one wants to do.

1214
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,240
Which I bet you wouldn't know because you're just slacking.

1215
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,760
I was in this damn room all the time.

1216
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,320
I found Neon smoking.

1217
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:24,980
Neon smoking.

1218
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:27,040
We can't... we can't refire him.

1219
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,840
He's already fired fired.

1220
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,480
Please get out of here.

1221
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,180
Does anyone have any leads on the slacker or am I simply gonna have to go with my gun?

1222
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,980
I thought everyone said it was Tina.

1223
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:36,800
I'm good.

1224
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:37,400
No!

1225
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,580
Wait, why would it be Tina?

1226
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,740
She just got hired.

1227
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,560
I'm like the second in smoke.

1228
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:44,740
Okay.

1229
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:45,360
Yeah, wait.

1230
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,320
Can we deal with that, guys?

1231
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,200
Are we just gonna sit...

1232
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,040
We should just kick the janitor out.

1233
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,120
He's not even employee.

1234
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,580
Why did you fire him again?

1235
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,400
We fired him again?

1236
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,420
You can fire him again?

1237
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,480
He fired the janitor again?

1238
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,420
That's crazy.

1239
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,120
That is so crazy.

1240
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,340
Okay.

1241
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:03,780
No!

1242
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,760
This support doesn't work.

1243
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,580
Yeah, I can't wait for you.

1244
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,460
Give me a second.

1245
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,400
I need to drop by and report.

1246
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,420
Thank you so much.

1247
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,320
Okay.

1248
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,040
This is a fire.

1249
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:13,900
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1250
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:14,880
It's okay.

1251
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:15,980
Is that how hand shakes work?

1252
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:17,380
Yeah.

1253
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,180
All right, here.

1254
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,120
Here's a smack for good luck to you.

1255
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,140
Oh, yeah.

1256
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,000
No, that's in my country.

1257
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1258
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,540
What country is it?

1259
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,180
Which country?

1260
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,120
It's just like...

1261
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:36,720
In the country of Blau, you smack your ass for high.

1262
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,380
Okay.

1263
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,700
Use a computer.

1264
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,940
I didn't pick up another self-cover.

1265
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:43,520
Where?

1266
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,240
I don't want...

1267
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:45,980
Where?

1268
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:46,480
Where?

1269
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:46,620
Where?

1270
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,240
Oh, there it is.

1271
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:48,640
Okay.

1272
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:50,520
Okay.

1273
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,300
Grab cells.

1274
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,600
Hey, hey.

1275
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,880
I'm grabbing my other quarterly report.

1276
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,620
We have so many good quarterlies.

1277
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:57,960
Wow.

1278
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:58,460
Perfect.

1279
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,160
Yeah, yeah.

1280
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,480
Business is booming.

1281
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,080
Our stock is rising.

1282
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:02,960
Did you know that?

1283
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,740
Don't let them know.

1284
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,240
I bought some of our stock too.

1285
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,700
I think that's legal, right?

1286
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,020
Okay.

1287
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,340
You know what?

1288
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,380
In Ohio, anything's legal.

1289
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,020
Oh, nice.

1290
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:12,560
All right.

1291
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,580
You hear that guy?

1292
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,320
There's no signal.

1293
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:16,460
Okay.

1294
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,080
There's no such thing as...

1295
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:20,380
Our boss said there's no such thing as insider trading.

1296
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,200
Okay.

1297
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:22,960
Make a copy.

1298
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:23,300
We're...

1299
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:23,600
Oh, there.

1300
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,440
Okay.

1301
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,140
Here we go.

1302
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,460
Good old Ohio.

1303
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,120
All right.

1304
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,260
Put the sales report on...

1305
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,060
Okay.

1306
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,120
There.

1307
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:33,440
Ow.

1308
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,460
Something like on your computer instead.

1309
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,160
Oh, you can play Snake.

1310
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:37,940
Yeah.

1311
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,200
Like, what are you doing?

1312
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,180
Because I feel like you're not all there.

1313
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,120
Okay.

1314
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,120
Let's see.

1315
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,400
The paper tray.

1316
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:44,760
Wait.

1317
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,340
I can't pick it back up.

1318
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:45,980
I just feel like...

1319
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:46,960
Hey, Blau.

1320
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,260
I have some work for you here.

1321
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,280
You have some extra reports to do.

1322
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,600
What is this I'm looking at?

1323
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,960
Like, here's a smack to you for good luck.

1324
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:55,840
Hey, thanks.

1325
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,920
Is that a virus on your computer?

1326
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:58,560
All right.

1327
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,660
Buy a banana.

1328
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,320
Oh, my gosh.

1329
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:01,800
I'm so hot.

1330
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:02,420
I need a banana.

1331
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,080
All right.

1332
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,480
That's why you shake your head, my man.

1333
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,800
How do we got?

1334
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,400
Where's the banana?

1335
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,360
Okay.

1336
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,380
All right.

1337
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,700
Guys, it's Tina.

1338
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,460
It's Tina.

1339
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,660
She's drinking on the job.

1340
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:15,960
Guys, it's Tina.

1341
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,720
I can't believe this.

1342
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:16,820
What?

1343
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,960
It's been a hard day of work for everybody.

1344
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,080
All right.

1345
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:20,860
You guys want a banana?

1346
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,340
No, thank you.

1347
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,160
I think an apple.

1348
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,020
Where's the apple?

1349
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:29,420
Wait.

1350
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,020
Is that a meeting?

1351
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:30,660
Yeah.

1352
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,640
That's a meeting.

1353
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,320
Oh, no.

1354
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,760
He's not calling a meeting.

1355
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,820
He doesn't know.

1356
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,800
Now you're getting an apple to try to save your Sorya.

1357
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,840
Guys, there's beers everywhere.

1358
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:41,860
Look.

1359
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,440
This is a really hard job.

1360
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,940
This is a really hard job.

1361
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:49,380
I need another beer.

1362
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,120
This way.

1363
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:51,420
This way.

1364
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:51,660
This way.

1365
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,560
This way.

1366
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,160
How do you run?

1367
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,520
I got you a beer.

1368
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,800
This has been a hard day.

1369
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:57,980
Oh, my goodness.

1370
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,080
I told you to put that in the fridge.

1371
00:38:59,080 --> 00:38:59,440
What about you?

1372
00:38:59,480 --> 00:38:59,780
See?

1373
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,000
Your shit is in the fridge.

1374
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,300
You had so much.

1375
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,100
My coward girl.

1376
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,260
Can she speak?

1377
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,020
Oh, thank you.

1378
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,220
Tina's not here right now.

1379
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,880
I know a lot of people are missing.

1380
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:11,880
I mean, you can see.

1381
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:12,440
Tina's drunk.

1382
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:13,420
She's drunk.

1383
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,940
I feel like Tina's been a menace this whole time.

1384
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,260
Tina?

1385
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:17,720
It's always late to meetings.

1386
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:17,940
It's not a good thing.

1387
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:18,240
You definitely.

1388
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:20,300
I still just kicked someone out who's not a drinker.

1389
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:20,900
Yeah.

1390
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,740
Let's do an attendance check.

1391
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:23,400
Tina.

1392
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:23,680
A lot.

1393
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,200
Who keeps...

1394
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:25,940
Oh, man.

1395
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:26,500
Tina.

1396
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,000
Sorry.

1397
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,340
Sorry.

1398
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,340
We are disappointed with your behavior.

1399
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:29,900
Sorry.

1400
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,360
We're late.

1401
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,040
Foolish.

1402
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,720
I'm going to say they've been late two times in a row.

1403
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:33,900
Yeah.

1404
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:34,560
They've been late.

1405
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,080
It's one of you.

1406
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:35,580
That's awesome.

1407
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:36,400
Who do we vote out?

1408
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:36,640
Huh?

1409
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,080
Who?

1410
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,360
Which slacker do we get rid of?

1411
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:38,840
One of the two.

1412
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,760
It's got to be one of the two.

1413
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,000
Guys.

1414
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:47,820
He might even be me.

1415
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,060
He might even fire me.

1416
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:51,320
She had a virus on her computer.

1417
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:51,980
Tina.

1418
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:52,740
Oh.

1419
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,300
Tina was a worker.

1420
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,300
She was a specialist.

1421
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:57,380
Guys.

1422
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:58,420
Okay.

1423
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,160
Tina.

1424
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,800
I was looking sussy.

1425
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,660
I'm not...

1426
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,320
I think Tina just doesn't know how to play.

1427
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:07,400
I think she just got hired today.

1428
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:08,940
Okay.

1429
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:09,700
Pick up this.

1430
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:10,820
Sir.

1431
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,060
The door is locked, sir.

1432
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,120
Oh, my goodness.

1433
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:15,740
Let me unlock that.

1434
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:15,940
Oh, my goodness.

1435
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,720
Okay.

1436
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:17,260
All right.

1437
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,480
All right.

1438
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,180
Financial.

1439
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,400
Let's pick up the financial.

1440
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,040
Another financial report?

1441
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,740
How many reports do we have?

1442
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:26,380
Okay.

1443
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:26,940
Oh.

1444
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:27,680
I have to shred it.

1445
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,720
Executive summary.

1446
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,240
This...

1447
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:30,480
Oh.

1448
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,300
That's true.

1449
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,160
Oh.

1450
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,340
Are we doing something illegal right now?

1451
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,800
Don't mind me.

1452
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:38,220
Just picking up after your sorry asses.

1453
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,040
Shred.

1454
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,480
There we go.

1455
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,720
They'll never know that we had a quarter loss.

1456
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,540
They'll never know.

1457
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:45,820
Oh.

1458
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,340
We have another...

1459
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,040
All right.

1460
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,280
Another sales confirmation.

1461
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,060
All right.

1462
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:51,740
Here we go.

1463
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,680
Print the sales confirmation.

1464
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,340
There's so many.

1465
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,280
Which one is it?

1466
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,440
Is it this one?

1467
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,300
I don't know how to open the door.

1468
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,140
Print the sales confirmation.

1469
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,040
Pick up.

1470
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,920
Have foolish sign the document.

1471
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:05,980
Put it...

1472
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:06,160
Okay.

1473
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,320
All right.

1474
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:07,880
Who is it?

1475
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,740
I unlocked it.

1476
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:09,540
Wait.

1477
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:10,260
No, you didn't.

1478
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,480
It was just in my computer.

1479
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,840
No, you didn't.

1480
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,180
I unlocked it.

1481
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:14,840
Did I not unlock this?

1482
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,320
No.

1483
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:15,580
Oh.

1484
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:15,900
I unlocked it.

1485
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,220
What if you guys are locking it again?

1486
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,300
It's locked again.

1487
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:21,660
What's going on?

1488
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:22,920
What's going on in there?

1489
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,600
I don't know how it works.

1490
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:25,280
I don't know how it works.

1491
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:25,780
Oh, wait.

1492
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:26,780
That's my form, Blau.

1493
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,560
Your eyebrows are red.

1494
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:29,560
I'm not sure if you trust me.

1495
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:29,840
Wait.

1496
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,620
Blau, that's my...

1497
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:31,880
Blau, that's my form.

1498
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,520
It's item red for Funky Friday.

1499
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,140
That's my quarterly report.

1500
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:37,720
The infected Floppy disk.

1501
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:38,420
They're everywhere.

1502
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:40,760
Wait.

1503
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:40,800
Why are you...

1504
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:40,960
Why are you...

1505
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,280
What's my form?

1506
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,560
Blau, that's my form.

1507
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,400
My computer's been blocked.

1508
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:45,860
My computer's been blocked.

1509
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:45,880
My computer's been blocked.

1510
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:45,920
My computer's been blocked.

1511
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,840
I'm infected with a virus.

1512
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,140
Could I...

1513
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:49,780
Wait.

1514
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:51,780
Is this not mine?

1515
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,080
Is this mine?

1516
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,520
Which form...

1517
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,560
Which form is this?

1518
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,600
I can't...

1519
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,020
I'm gonna...

1520
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:00,660
Okay.

1521
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:01,540
Wait.

1522
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,220
I have a key.

1523
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,080
Seriously?

1524
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,980
I have another form for you to sign.

1525
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,220
It's another quarterly report.

1526
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:06,800
Of course.

1527
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:07,100
Here.

1528
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,200
It's right on the ground.

1529
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,020
I can get it for you.

1530
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:09,780
Hey.

1531
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:10,380
No worries.

1532
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:10,980
Oh, my God.

1533
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,000
How many quarterly reports are in a quarterly report?

1534
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,800
You're one of our best workers, Toki.

1535
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,020
One day, you're gonna get that promotion.

1536
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:17,360
Oh, my God.

1537
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,200
I'm gonna get that promotion?

1538
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:20,840
One day, I'll be a boss just like you?

1539
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:22,420
Yeah.

1540
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,200
So, what's up?

1541
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:24,760
Okay.

1542
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:25,380
Oh, my God.

1543
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,200
The paper tray.

1544
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,180
Oh, dear God.

1545
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,200
I gotta put some work there.

1546
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:29,800
Oh, please.

1547
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:30,760
There you go.

1548
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:32,720
I'm doing my job.

1549
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:33,640
I'm nine to five.

1550
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,280
I love working at the office.

1551
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:35,960
Thanks.

1552
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,460
This is my first job.

1553
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:37,920
Oh, it was on the floor.

1554
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:38,200
It was already on the floor.

1555
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:38,860
Just keep it.

1556
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:39,440
Keep it on the floor.

1557
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:39,460
Hey.

1558
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,580
I'll still drink it.

1559
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,080
Don't worry.

1560
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:42,760
Keep it on the floor.

1561
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,260
Keep it on the floor.

1562
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:47,340
Oh, thank you.

1563
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:47,840
Thank you.

1564
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,820
It has been a stressful day, let me tell you.

1565
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:50,660
Um.

1566
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:52,720
Good news to bad news.

1567
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,380
Bad news...

1568
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:54,640
Um.

1569
00:42:55,660 --> 00:43:00,140
You guys as a whole are pretty bad at your jobs.

1570
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:00,640
Wait.

1571
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,280
I thought you said I was your best worker.

1572
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:03,860
You.

1573
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:04,700
Yeah.

1574
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,960
Hell yeah, Toki.

1575
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:06,840
Yay!

1576
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,640
I'm not laughing at it.

1577
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:09,380
Yay.

1578
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,280
What.

1579
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:11,980
I'm happy.

1580
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:12,700
Happy.

1581
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,800
I'm laughing because I just am mortified that I did that to you.

1582
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:18,940
No, hey, listen.

1583
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,860
I really hope that one day we can...

1584
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:21,340
I'm talking.

1585
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,380
Janet, um...

1586
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,940
Foolish, you got 20 seconds to fire someone.

1587
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:25,360
Janet!

1588
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:26,000
You know what?

1589
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,280
We can't be having this.

1590
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,140
We can't be having this.

1591
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:28,360
Oh, I'm sorry.

1592
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:28,520
Get her.

1593
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,020
Get her.

1594
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:29,520
Get her now.

1595
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,120
It's disarray.

1596
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:35,820
Foolish, there's only two firings left and two slackers.

1597
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:37,680
If you get another one wrong, you lose the whole game.

1598
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,540
We're really gonna need to figure this out.

1599
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:40,780
We're really gonna need to figure this out.

1600
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:43,220
If we get another one wrong, it's all over at that point.

1601
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,220
Alright, you know what?

1602
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:44,920
You know what?

1603
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,160
I'm gonna start trying now.

1604
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:46,860
Okay?

1605
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:47,980
I know who the slackers are.

1606
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,800
Wait, who are they?

1607
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,120
If you know who they are, can you tell us right now?

1608
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,860
Oh, I probably shouldn't say that yet though or else, um...

1609
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:58,260
I mean, if you know who they are, just call the meeting right now and vote them off.

1610
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,000
But then they could do like a sabotage and then, you know...

1611
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,540
Yeah, but if you call the meeting now, they can't do a sabotage.

1612
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:04,940
Up to you.

1613
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:05,880
Oh...

1614
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:09,200
Man, I don't like how you're questioning the boss.

1615
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:10,360
Oh, you're right.

1616
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:11,060
I'm so sorry.

1617
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:12,340
You know it all, manager.

1618
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,500
You're right.

1619
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:15,460
We should never question your methods.

1620
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,160
You're right.

1621
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:19,540
Okay.

1622
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:21,320
Alright.

1623
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,760
Time to use the bathroom.

1624
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,580
Are you using the bathroom?

1625
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:26,480
No, no.

1626
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:27,140
I was just here.

1627
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:28,000
Oh, okay.

1628
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:28,480
Sorry.

1629
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,580
Okay, I'll just wait until...

1630
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:31,900
I get a little performance anxiety, you know?

1631
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:33,200
Wait, is this the...

1632
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:34,540
Is this the woman's bathroom?

1633
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:36,760
I think we only have one bathroom.

1634
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,720
Are you a new hire?

1635
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,360
What does WC mean?

1636
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:40,520
Oh, no.

1637
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:41,620
We have another bathroom.

1638
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:44,760
Wait, why are you in the woman's bathroom?

1639
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:45,540
What are you doing?

1640
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,120
What does WC mean?

1641
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:50,080
It means washroom?

1642
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:51,980
With a seat?

1643
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:52,900
Look at this couch.

1644
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,620
Why is there a couch in the bathroom?

1645
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:57,040
I don't know.

1646
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:58,560
It's got to absorb too many smells.

1647
00:44:58,620 --> 00:44:59,420
Yeah, I was going to say.

1648
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,140
There's got to be a lot of stains here.

1649
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:05,260
I'm going to go do my task.

1650
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,200
All right, guys.

1651
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:08,400
Guys.

1652
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,540
Guys, I need you guys to...

1653
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,540
I'm going to mute the game, guys, okay?

1654
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,660
I'm going to mute the game.

1655
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:16,940
Guys,

1656
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:23,580
it's not funny.

1657
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:26,380
Guys, it's not funny.

1658
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:31,320
Just using the bathroom.

1659
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:32,960
Please don't listen in.

1660
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,240
Please don't listen in.

1661
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:36,140
Okay.

1662
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:36,960
Thank God.

1663
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:37,260
Okay.

1664
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,300
All right.

1665
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:42,200
Guys, it's a little embarrassing.

1666
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:43,980
I get a little performance anxiety.

1667
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,040
How do I get out?

1668
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,340
Wait, how do I...

1669
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:49,280
How do I...

1670
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:49,900
Oh, thank God.

1671
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:50,240
Okay.

1672
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,360
Pick up the sales forecast.

1673
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:55,620
I saw that.

1674
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:58,740
I refilled the toilet paper for the world.

1675
00:45:58,820 --> 00:45:59,220
All right.

1676
00:45:59,360 --> 00:45:59,920
Grab.

1677
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,300
You now have a clean bottom.

1678
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:04,260
Here's the forecast.

1679
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,720
Oh, it's right here.

1680
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:07,600
Okay, nice.

1681
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:08,120
Okay.

1682
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:10,320
Well, I don't know what to do with this paper anymore.

1683
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,160
Sir, I know that we're about to have a meeting.

1684
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:18,320
I just want to say after the meeting, I actually need you to clear a virus from a PC.

1685
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,500
You're the only one who can do it.

1686
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:20,020
Oh, of course.

1687
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:20,560
Of course.

1688
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:21,420
I love doing that.

1689
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:21,700
Oh, my God.

1690
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:22,540
This game is hectic.

1691
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:25,280
I don't want to sit in the...

1692
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,440
I don't want to get...

1693
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,660
I don't want him to fire me, so I'm going to sit in the back.

1694
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:29,500
I think...

1695
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:30,100
No.

1696
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:30,360
Come on.

1697
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:33,340
I don't know.

1698
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:34,960
We've been through a lot this past week.

1699
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:35,560
You know?

1700
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:36,060
Yup.

1701
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:37,740
Foolish is a slacker!

1702
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:39,040
What?

1703
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:39,720
I'm not a slacker!

1704
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,040
Foolish can't be a slacker.

1705
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:41,820
He's the manager.

1706
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:42,840
He's the manager.

1707
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:45,580
That's insane to assume of our great leader.

1708
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:46,300
Yeah, yeah.

1709
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:50,720
You know, I think Valkyrie might be the slacker for calling him out as a slacker.

1710
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:53,840
I literally ordered paper reams for the company!

1711
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,140
Why are we doing paper reams?

1712
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:59,780
What did you say?

1713
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:00,080
Paper reams?

1714
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:05,660
I think paper reams are literally just printing papers.

1715
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:11,640
Ray thinks I'm a schlocker because I have a virus on my PC which I need the manager to handle.

1716
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,840
Yeah, but what if you put the virus on yourself?

1717
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,040
Oh boy, oh boy.

1718
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:19,080
When in doubt, you know who to go with.

1719
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:20,260
Oh.

1720
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:23,300
Oh my god.

1721
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,600
Wow, I did not expect that.

1722
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:26,300
Wow.

1723
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:28,480
Wow.

1724
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:30,180
Wow, I think we lost.

1725
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:37,880
I think the stock prices are falling, Mr. Manager.

1726
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:39,820
There's a server outage.

1727
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:47,920
Guys, so basically, because there's two slackers left and there's one termination left, we lose automatically.

1728
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:51,760
We lose automatically.

1729
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:53,700
Oops.

1730
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:55,460
Well.

1731
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:56,680
I didn't do that.

1732
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:58,260
Okay, paper ream.

1733
00:47:58,300 --> 00:47:59,760
What is a paper ream anyway?

1734
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:01,960
Guys, we gotta sell.

1735
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:03,360
We have to sell the stock, guys.

1736
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,900
It's crashing right now.

1737
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,020
Guys, we got...

1738
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:12,420
What is that word call when you bet against the stock?

1739
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:14,340
Guys, it's time to short the stock, guys.

1740
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:17,460
It's time to short the stock.

1741
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:18,180
It's time to short the stock.

1742
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:20,860
What is even the point of working?

1743
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:21,480
What is even the point of working?

1744
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,400
We're gonna get fired anyway.

1745
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:25,060
We're gonna get fired anyway.

1746
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:27,160
We're gonna get fired.

1747
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:28,980
How is it me?

1748
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,480
I'm just doing my work.

1749
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:32,780
It doesn't matter.

1750
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:34,680
We're gonna...

1751
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:35,980
We're gonna get fired.

1752
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:37,660
There's another meeting?

1753
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:39,620
No, no, I think that's the fire alarm.

1754
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:40,540
I think there's a fire.

1755
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:43,380
There's a fire.

1756
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,180
There's a fire.

1757
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,220
Why is there a fire?

1758
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:50,440
You would have gotten away with it too.

1759
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:51,680
You would have gotten away with it.

1760
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:53,740
Janitor, put out the fire.

1761
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:54,680
What are you doing?

1762
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,420
Did you get trained?

1763
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:58,580
What are you doing?

1764
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:00,080
What do you mean?

1765
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,480
Oh my god, how do you use this?

1766
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,180
I don't know.

1767
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,080
I think it's empty.

1768
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:08,420
I was just throwing things in the garbage.

1769
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:13,540
I was just throwing things in the garbage.

1770
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:14,720
Why are you putting music on?

1771
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,300
That's how you got trained in janitor school.

1772
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:18,440
That's how you got trained in janitor school.

1773
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:19,080
Why are you...

1774
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:20,060
That sucks.

1775
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:24,060
That sucks.

1776
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,440
Drop and roll.

1777
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:26,680
Guys, we fixed it.

1778
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:27,460
We fixed the fire.

1779
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:30,580
I saved the company.

1780
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,040
Guys, do you guys know there's a meeting?

1781
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:34,880
Yeah.

1782
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:37,680
We should go to that then.

1783
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,660
Oh my god.

1784
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:47,320
Everybody's sake comp starts breakdancing.

1785
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,660
Guys, I had to put out the fire.

1786
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:53,460
The janitor did not go to janitor school.

1787
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,620
I am gonna take responsibility.

1788
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,320
I haven't been the best.

1789
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:01,260
And I should have chosen a better assistant.

1790
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:02,920
It's all his fault.

1791
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,220
This is insane.

1792
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:08,020
I freaking knew it was blow.

1793
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:12,300
When he started spanking.

1794
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:13,000
Yeah.

1795
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,360
What did we get?

1796
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:19,680
Money?

1797
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:21,640
Yeah, you can buy cosmetics.

1798
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:23,640
Dude, that's nice.

1799
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,020
We were gonna win.

1800
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:27,420
Who snitched on me?

1801
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,640
Why did they snitch on me?

1802
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,660
Tina is the most slacker slacker that's not a slacker I've ever seen.

1803
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,480
I think Tina didn't know how to play.

1804
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,080
I think she was learning.

1805
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,040
She didn't know.

1806
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,760
I was just watching and she had no idea.

1807
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:45,980
Dude, it's such a mess.

1808
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:48,900
It just looks like everyone's walking and running around.

1809
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:51,560
I don't know how to say a random name.

1810
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:52,880
How was I supposed to figure it out?

1811
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:55,620
That's the best part.

1812
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:56,880
You aren't supposed to.

1813
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:57,400
Yeah.

1814
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:02,900
And then even when I asked Tina who started the fire, she was like, uh, it was Lily.

1815
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,720
Like, why is she saying it like that?

1816
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:05,900
It was.

1817
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:08,220
Yeah, but it was.

1818
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,600
But it was Lily, though.

1819
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:14,200
Join, guys, join.

1820
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:17,380
Maybe we should have longer meetings then.

1821
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,520
So we can actually...

1822
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:19,960
You fired me!

1823
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,680
Yeah, that's what you get for snitching.

1824
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:26,200
There was one round left, no matter what, and I figured I should fire you.

1825
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:31,680
Tina, you're gonna need to step it up if you ever want to make it as assistant manager.

1826
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:33,540
Wait, assistant manager?

1827
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,940
She already got promoted, but all she did was slack!

1828
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:45,100
What if Tina actually became the manager this time?

1829
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:46,000
She also had the floppy disk.

1830
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:51,540
It's like, who's always thrown around trashy fire right in front of me.

1831
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:52,640
And I was so confused.

1832
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:55,000
How do I join the lobby?

1833
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:55,720
Which volume?

1834
00:51:58,620 --> 00:51:59,400
Stolen credit.

1835
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:02,220
I can't believe they stole my credit!

1836
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,540
She didn't know how to pick up the fire!

1837
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:05,920
So which one?

1838
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:08,700
You want to raise the volume of the game or discord chat?

1839
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:10,800
I'm giving you the power.

1840
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,600
I'm giving you the power, Mio.

1841
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:17,560
You guys want to raise the volume of the game or the discord chat?

1842
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:18,200
Oh, that's gonna be great.

1843
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,020
We are missing Lily.

1844
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:22,220
Huh?

1845
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:23,260
Oh, my bad.

1846
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:26,500
Promotion always goes to the most capital.

1847
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:28,420
Hold on, how do I join?

1848
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:30,520
We are missing...

1849
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:32,720
Are we going to New York?

1850
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:33,800
Or is it Ohio?

1851
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:36,260
There are other maps.

1852
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:38,580
There's like the recreation of...

1853
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:40,180
Like from the office?

1854
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,440
Yeah, there's the office map.

1855
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:43,380
Whoa!

1856
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:48,540
Yeah, like one of the tasks is to put Jello in the stapler too.

1857
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:49,660
Whoa!

1858
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:51,020
Wait, that's awesome.

1859
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:52,980
I could be Pam.

1860
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:54,640
You could be!

1861
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,600
I'm gonna be Pam.

1862
00:52:57,740 --> 00:52:59,260
I'm Pam coded, I'm not gonna lie.

1863
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,860
Ready up, ready up, ready up.

1864
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,420
The extra greeting.

1865
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:07,120
I did so much!

1866
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,560
I did so much!

1867
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,980
This is what it's like to work at 9 to 5!

1868
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,640
It doesn't matter how hard you work!

1869
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:15,520
It's all about the network!

1870
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:18,280
This is fucked.

1871
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,500
This is fucked.

1872
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:22,380
It doesn't matter how hard you work!

1873
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:26,700
It's just how you know people and how you fucking...

1874
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:30,940
It's just how you know people and how you fucking...

1875
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:32,980
Welcome to the office life!

1876
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:35,120
Welcome to the office life!

1877
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:37,060
It's all about nepotism!

1878
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:37,780
What do you mean?

1879
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:38,800
What's that got to do with anything?

1880
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:40,600
Am I unmuted?

1881
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:41,520
Yeah.

1882
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:44,380
We have our new manager.

1883
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:47,560
The microphone turns on like slightly.

1884
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:48,100
What's dangerous?

1885
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,540
I aspire to do something wonderful.

1886
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:50,800
Alright.

1887
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:55,820
Can't wait to start my day working in my favorite company.

1888
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,240
Best day of my life.

1889
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:00,620
Alright.

1890
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:02,020
Snake.

1891
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:05,300
Best day of my life.

1892
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,000
No!

1893
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:08,440
Mike!

1894
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:11,800
I was doing important work and there's no connection already?

1895
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:15,320
Oh, the screen.

1896
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:15,900
Sorry guys.

1897
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:17,000
Sorry.

1898
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:21,140
Guys, I need...

1899
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:23,020
The server is out guys.

1900
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:25,400
Guys, I need...

1901
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,060
The server is out guys.

1902
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:28,400
Oh!

1903
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,180
She already got promoted!

1904
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,800
She already got promoted!

1905
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:35,920
I knew it's all about...

1906
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,260
I knew it's all about...

1907
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:38,940
I knew it.

1908
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:39,860
Nepotism.

1909
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:41,760
I called nepotism!

1910
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,040
I called nepotism!

1911
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:45,460
Tina, who are we firing now?

1912
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:46,960
We don't have to.

1913
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:47,540
We have two minutes left.

1914
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:49,140
We have two minutes.

1915
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,280
Someone's gonna be on the chopping board, guys.

1916
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:53,200
Yeah, let's have an orientation.

1917
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:54,840
We have 30 seconds.

1918
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:55,680
I gotta do some work.

1919
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:57,720
Okay, what's your work, man?

1920
00:54:58,860 --> 00:54:59,540
You know what?

1921
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:00,580
You two...

1922
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:01,980
Worst managers I've ever seen.

1923
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:04,360
Alright, let's get this guy out of here.

1924
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:05,500
I don't like this calendar.

1925
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:07,700
I'm down.

1926
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:11,480
Slacker again!

1927
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,600
And twice in a row!

1928
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,920
LM, I think you gotta fix your reputation, LM.

1929
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:20,280
You're never gonna play the game.

1930
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:23,500
You're never gonna be able to work.

1931
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:27,680
Excellent work.

1932
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:29,700
That's to be expected of me.

1933
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:32,960
Tina, I'm so happy you got promoted.

1934
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:34,820
You did amazing.

1935
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:36,340
I know!

1936
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:37,620
Why don't we shake hands?

1937
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,240
I mean, I deserve that, but...

1938
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:42,160
Oh, thank you!

1939
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:44,520
Can we shake hands, Ms. Assistant Manager?

1940
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:47,340
For a good job that you got promoted?

1941
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:49,020
Yeah!

1942
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,140
Good job!

1943
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:51,540
I always knew you got this!

1944
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:54,400
I always knew you totally deserved that job!

1945
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:57,160
Thank you so much!

1946
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:58,580
I hope the same for you!

1947
00:55:58,740 --> 00:55:59,620
What do you want?

1948
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:00,520
What?

1949
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:04,820
Oh, cats!

1950
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:09,060
Wait, what's the bathroom?

1951
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:09,980
Where's the cats?

1952
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:11,060
Oh, the cats are over here.

1953
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:12,060
Alright.

1954
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:13,840
Brown...

1955
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:16,060
Activated.

1956
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,980
Guys, what are you guys doing in the server room?

1957
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,200
Thank you so much!

1958
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:21,940
I got it!

1959
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,440
Alright, nice, I fixed it.

1960
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:25,980
Alright, pet the cats.

1961
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,400
Hello, little kitties.

1962
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:29,520
Hello.

1963
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:32,100
Hello, little kitties.

1964
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:34,100
Oh, another meeting?

1965
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,220
Why do we have so many meetings, Ms. Manager?

1966
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:43,820
Oh, I know exactly who the slacker is.

1967
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:44,120
Oh!

1968
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:45,460
Who is it?

1969
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:50,300
Uh, I'm gonna let them confess their sins first.

1970
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:50,960
Oh!

1971
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:52,800
That's bold of you.

1972
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:53,980
That's really bullsy.

1973
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:55,640
Tina...

1974
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:58,960
Alright, name who the slacker is.

1975
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:01,960
I thought you knew who the slacker is, Ms. Manager.

1976
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,260
Oh, I know, but I'm gonna let Tina take it away.

1977
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:08,960
Yeah, Tina, you obviously know who the slacker is too!

1978
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:10,040
What?

1979
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:12,140
What?

1980
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:13,500
That's slacker behavior!

1981
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:13,860
What?

1982
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:17,960
That could be like... Isn't that like a homie thing?

1983
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:19,000
You bros poop together?

1984
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:21,260
Isn't that what bros do?

1985
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:23,160
That's a lie.

1986
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:24,840
Why are you lying?

1987
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,160
And who is it, Dino?

1988
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:26,520
Who is it?

1989
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:30,080
I make the dimes, that's why I poop on company time.

1990
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,140
Is that right, Dino?

1991
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:32,260
No, no, no.

1992
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:32,580
Yeah, yeah.

1993
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:34,420
Did you poop on company time?

1994
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:36,480
Oh, Mia, you gotta vote someone out.

1995
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:37,100
Mia, please.

1996
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:39,080
Because I have a raise that I worked hard for.

1997
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,160
Oh, oh.

1998
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,860
Oh, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1999
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:44,620
Okay, to be fair, uh...

2000
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:48,100
Oh, Dino.

2001
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:49,440
Oh.

2002
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:50,820
Oh, brother, this is unbelievable.

2003
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:52,500
Damn, Dino.

2004
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,660
Oh, I got Ray.

2005
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:55,920
Sorry, Dino.

2006
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:56,320
Assistant Ray, nice.

2007
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:57,380
It is what it is.

2008
00:57:58,160 --> 00:57:59,300
Congratulations on the promotion.

2009
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:01,400
Yeah, congratulations on the promotion.

2010
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:03,320
You're a disappointment.

2011
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:04,880
Thank God Tina got demoted.

2012
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,120
She didn't deserve that job.

2013
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:08,020
She didn't fucking deserve it.

2014
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,380
She didn't deserve it.

2015
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:15,700
She didn't deserve it.

2016
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,460
Okay, they won't know I'm playing Minesweeper, guys.

2017
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,140
How would they know?

2018
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:22,120
Okay.

2019
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:25,180
Okay, there we go.

2020
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:26,260
How would they know?

2021
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:29,380
Okay, I won the game.

2022
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:29,920
There we go.

2023
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:32,720
This is how you...

2024
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:33,800
This is how you...

2025
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,260
This is how you play the game.

2026
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:38,240
Bro, I can't with these locked doors.

2027
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:39,940
Uh, hey, Mia.

2028
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:40,140
Uh, hey, Mia.

2029
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:40,240
Um...

2030
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:41,140
Oh.

2031
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:43,100
I can't go anywhere.

2032
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:44,000
It was me.

2033
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:45,280
Okay, I need a...

2034
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:45,700
Locking the doors.

2035
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:46,760
I need a...

2036
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:47,260
Let's open the door.

2037
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:48,880
Wait, yeah, who keeps managers?

2038
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:49,620
Someone...

2039
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:50,780
We need doors open.

2040
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:57,380
Welcome to working at a nine-to-five.

2041
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,660
This is why we're streamers.

2042
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:05,960
Hey, does everyone know I show those desks?

2043
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:09,360
Come, come, look at my desks.

2044
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,000
Where are the keys?

2045
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:13,380
Oh, there's a fire.

2046
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:14,140
There's a fire.

2047
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:15,920
Work without my map.

2048
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:16,840
Where's the fire?

2049
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:17,820
There's a fire.

2050
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:18,720
This is my desk.

2051
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,740
Oh, Alan, did you start the fire?

2052
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:25,700
Where's the fire extinguisher?

2053
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:27,220
Chad, he started the fire.

2054
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,040
All right, all right, here we go.

2055
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:33,060
All right, here we go.

2056
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:35,900
It's okay, it's okay.

2057
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:37,420
The company is saved.

2058
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:40,120
Stock prices continue to...

2059
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:42,100
Hey, nice, nice.

2060
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:43,500
...to this entire office.

2061
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:44,540
Oh, my God.

2062
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:45,200
What does that mean?

2063
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:46,840
Come this way.

2064
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:48,860
Oh, you know what it means, right?

2065
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:49,540
Oh, my God.

2066
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:51,460
I need to shake hands with somebody.

2067
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:52,820
What's the point?

2068
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:54,440
What's the fucking point?

2069
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,460
We're gonna lose anyway.

2070
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:58,640
What's the point?

2071
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:00,640
We're gonna get fired anyway.

2072
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:03,140
Let's just drink it all.

2073
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:04,370
Another fi...

2074
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:05,560
Okay, I give up.

2075
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:06,640
Let's break it down.

2076
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:08,260
Oh, yeah.

2077
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:09,760
Oh, yeah.

2078
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:11,140
It started the fire.

2079
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:12,260
This is it.

2080
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,040
This is our shit.

2081
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:13,440
I don't know.

2082
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:14,500
I don't know.

2083
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:15,620
Oh, my God.

2084
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:17,840
Oh, it's fire.

2085
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:18,800
What's she gonna do?

2086
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:19,820
Fire us?

2087
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:20,440
Oh, no.

2088
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:20,800
Oh, no.

2089
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,600
What's she gonna do?

2090
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,200
Oh, my God.

2091
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:27,040
I'm out.

2092
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:28,920
It's too much work.

2093
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:29,840
Okay.

2094
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:31,000
I'm opening it.

2095
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:31,900
I'm opening it.

2096
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,100
This is too much.

2097
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:34,740
I can't.

2098
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:36,660
I can't.

2099
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:39,420
That's crazy.

2100
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:39,740
Okay.

2101
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:41,420
Well, Ray, do you have anything?

2102
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:42,360
Oh, yes.

2103
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:46,420
I saw Foolish run through the server room and he started the server thing.

2104
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:49,260
He started the server thing?

2105
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:50,240
You were in the room before.

2106
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:51,520
I guess I...

2107
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,640
Well, I guess he didn't even know that I was lying down here.

2108
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:57,700
Manager, I saw Foolish trying to hotbox the staff room.

2109
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:00,820
I saw Foolish start a fire in the trash can in the office.

2110
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:01,480
Wow.

2111
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:02,060
Wow.

2112
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:03,220
I guess something is everywhere.

2113
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,660
If it's Foolish, then it can't be Foolish.

2114
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:06,580
It's gotta be Foolish.

2115
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,380
Yeah, I saw him start a fire.

2116
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:09,720
I saw him start two fires.

2117
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:11,780
Just kill me.

2118
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:12,620
Just kill me.

2119
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:13,580
Just kill me, bro.

2120
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:15,260
Don't do it, Miong.

2121
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:15,980
Don't do it.

2122
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:16,120
Oh!

2123
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:17,420
Oh, wow.

2124
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:18,180
She was a slacker.

2125
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:18,660
Oh, wow.

2126
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:19,100
She was.

2127
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:20,680
There's only one.

2128
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:21,440
Yeah.

2129
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:22,880
That's what I saw, LM.

2130
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:23,840
You really...

2131
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:24,500
You really...

2132
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:26,100
You really outed Ray for that.

2133
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:27,140
Hey, thank you, Mono.

2134
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:31,620
I can't believe it.

2135
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:31,700
Wait.

2136
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:32,360
Where's Pam?

2137
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:34,140
I thought we had a Pam.

2138
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,420
Oh, LM was promoted?

2139
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:39,700
You can get promoted.

2140
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:41,080
But he was a janitor.

2141
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:47,840
Wait.

2142
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,120
What do we...

2143
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:49,860
Fire.

2144
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:53,400
Oh!

2145
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:54,040
The plant loves this.

2146
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:55,420
The plant loves this.

2147
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:57,140
We'll transform this into Oxygen for us.

2148
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:58,240
I'm getting him out.

2149
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:00,120
Just send more Monster up!

2150
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:00,740
Just send more Monster up!

2151
01:02:00,740 --> 01:02:01,180
How do I...

2152
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:02,000
Post this?

2153
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:05,580
Anonymous...

2154
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:07,180
Anonymous letter...

2155
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:08,380
What?

2156
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:09,460
What's going on here?

2157
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:09,700
What?

2158
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:11,880
Anonymous letter.

2159
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:22,360
What am I supposed to do?

2160
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:23,680
Oh, it's another fucking meeting.

2161
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:24,720
Are you fucking kidding me?

2162
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:26,740
Please, I can't get my job.

2163
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:29,420
I can't get my job!

2164
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:31,880
What am I supposed to do?

2165
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:35,860
Why can't I get an E-Test done?

2166
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:40,660
Okay.

2167
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:43,760
Find another quick meeting.

2168
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:45,660
Okay, um...

2169
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:47,780
Goki, why are you littering everywhere?

2170
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:48,620
What's going on?

2171
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:51,080
It's just I'm so overworked.

2172
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:54,340
I signed so many reports and so many quarterly reports.

2173
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:59,140
I literally picked up the quarterly report but it doesn't matter because we have a meeting.

2174
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:00,120
What does it matter?

2175
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:04,980
Why did you put fire foolish like the sticky note on the ground?

2176
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:05,420
Oh, I found it.

2177
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:07,580
I found it on the floor so I just put it there.

2178
01:03:09,580 --> 01:03:10,100
Okay.

2179
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:12,740
That sounds like a useful hint.

2180
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:15,640
You're looking great today, Ms. Mannequin.

2181
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:17,840
So...

2182
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,440
Yeah, what else did you do today?

2183
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:23,120
Did you do something with your eyebrows?

2184
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:24,920
Did you get them tattooed?

2185
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:25,700
Be honest.

2186
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:27,520
You just look so good today.

2187
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:28,940
Okay.

2188
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:30,140
Thank you, man.

2189
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:30,920
I appreciate that.

2190
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,000
No problem, no problem.

2191
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:35,680
Oh, meeting's over!

2192
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:36,360
Yay!

2193
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:38,360
You don't have to, no.

2194
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,560
She can call another meeting.

2195
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:44,020
I have to pick up trash?

2196
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:44,700
Okay.

2197
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:46,700
Always laughing at you getting bullied.

2198
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:47,140
Okay.

2199
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:52,220
Where's my...

2200
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:53,160
Listen.

2201
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,000
Where's trash?

2202
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:56,980
Any trash?

2203
01:03:56,980 --> 01:03:58,400
Our janitor's not doing their work.

2204
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:01,040
Okay.

2205
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:04,760
You know, all those games that they said...

2206
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:05,160
Trash.

2207
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:08,060
I heard that was the number one OLED gaming monitor in the US.

2208
01:04:08,060 --> 01:04:10,500
Oh my god, I can't believe so many...

2209
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:12,580
There's so many mouse trash.

2210
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:14,740
How do I... How do I...

2211
01:04:14,740 --> 01:04:16,300
Throw this... Okay, there you go.

2212
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:17,000
I threw it away.

2213
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:18,440
Okay, I need a soda.

2214
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:20,320
I need a soda.

2215
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:21,820
I need a...

2216
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:25,220
Beer on the ground is not trash, it's a lifestyle.

2217
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:29,440
It's trash.

2218
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:32,720
There's... Oh, I already got a soda.

2219
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:33,500
Alright.

2220
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:35,540
Oh my god.

2221
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:36,520
I can't.

2222
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:37,200
I can't.

2223
01:04:38,060 --> 01:04:38,280
Boom!

2224
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:39,560
How do we get in there?

2225
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:40,200
Yeah, where?

2226
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:41,300
The server room?

2227
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:42,720
It's here.

2228
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:46,000
Oh, no, there's another meeting.

2229
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:48,380
It's corporate life.

2230
01:04:48,380 --> 01:04:48,920
So many meetings.

2231
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:50,480
But I love that.

2232
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:55,700
I will pass if there is someone here and I don't want to do it.

2233
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:58,380
But it has to be done.

2234
01:04:58,520 --> 01:04:59,680
LM, just shut up.

2235
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:00,300
Shut up.

2236
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:02,420
Oh my god.

2237
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:04,400
You're doing great, Ms. Manager.

2238
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:05,800
You might have to go.

2239
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:07,400
For what?

2240
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:08,220
Wait, I've been great.

2241
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:09,560
Wait, what did he do?

2242
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:11,760
We've been working together.

2243
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:12,960
Yeah, I saw them working.

2244
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:14,220
You might have to go.

2245
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:16,140
Wait, but I've been so good too.

2246
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:17,420
I literally shred paper.

2247
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:18,720
Yeah, I saw that too.

2248
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:20,580
I saw her feed cats.

2249
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:23,020
I saw her...

2250
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:23,740
Call her out, Shoto.

2251
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:24,800
I didn't see that.

2252
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:25,420
Saw her what?

2253
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:28,720
I saw her do stuff on her computer and do like inventory.

2254
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:30,160
I've seen you shred paper once.

2255
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:33,480
Okay, I'm going to leave this to Foolish.

2256
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:33,820
He was it.

2257
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:35,140
Oh.

2258
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:38,740
Great question.

2259
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:40,240
Great question.

2260
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:44,240
Who here knows about viruses?

2261
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,240
I don't think we have time.

2262
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:48,100
I think Foolish should stop.

2263
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:51,440
Where did that come from?

2264
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:52,300
Where did that come from?

2265
01:05:52,340 --> 01:05:53,140
Where was that shot?

2266
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:55,340
Where was that shot from?

2267
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:56,840
Oh my god.

2268
01:05:56,860 --> 01:05:58,080
I think I know who it is.

2269
01:05:58,560 --> 01:05:59,520
Wait, who is it?

2270
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:00,080
Who is it?

2271
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:01,540
I think I know who it is.

2272
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:02,360
Oh, hey, Lily.

2273
01:06:02,580 --> 01:06:04,160
Alright, I got to put the...

2274
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:07,120
Good job.

2275
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:08,100
Good job, everybody.

2276
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:09,940
Another good job.

2277
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:10,540
Well done.

2278
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:11,220
Okay.

2279
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:14,720
Guys, I'm going to pull an epic pet prank, guys.

2280
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:16,680
It's going to be so epic.

2281
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:19,080
People are going to find it so fucking funny.

2282
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:23,940
Guys, people are going to find it so fucking funny.

2283
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:27,700
Oh my god, who did that?

2284
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:28,980
What is this?

2285
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:31,060
We should put it on a bulletin board.

2286
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:32,900
Let's put it on the bulletin board.

2287
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:33,980
Right here.

2288
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:34,580
Okay.

2289
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:38,820
Oh, look at that.

2290
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:41,880
Look at you.

2291
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:44,060
I'm going to sign it.

2292
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:44,280
Oh.

2293
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:46,020
Oh, it was Saikudo.

2294
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:47,680
Oh, we won.

2295
01:06:47,860 --> 01:06:48,560
Yeah, we won.

2296
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:52,120
Where the fuck is Aleph?

2297
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:52,320
Where the fuck is Aleph?

2298
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:54,080
He didn't even come.

2299
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:57,080
I'm done with you, you motherfucker.

2300
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,540
Oh, how d'you...

2301
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:01,640
Go away.

2302
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:02,860
How d'you...

2303
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:04,040
I've never seen you strong.

2304
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:04,600
Aleph.

2305
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:04,940
How d'you...

2306
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:05,560
Go away.

2307
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:05,760
Oh, my gosh.

2308
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:05,780
Just...

2309
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:06,600
So hard!

2310
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:08,020
I'm sorry.

2311
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:08,760
I'm sorry.

2312
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:11,900
It doesn't make any sense!

2313
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:13,120
I was late to the meeting.

2314
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:15,460
He crashed it out, Brad.

2315
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:17,140
He straight up got himself out.

2316
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:18,520
And then got me and Ray out.

2317
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:19,080
It was crazy.

2318
01:07:19,940 --> 01:07:21,860
Dude, if Elef's imposter...

2319
01:07:21,860 --> 01:07:23,780
If I'm imposter with him, I'm actually alt f4-ing.

2320
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:24,480
I actually am.

2321
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:25,320
Wait, wait.

2322
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:27,140
How did Elef call a psychudo?

2323
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:28,100
What happened?

2324
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:31,340
Dude, he threw me under the bus.

2325
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:32,320
What did he do?

2326
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:34,700
He threw himself out first round.

2327
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:35,040
What did he do?

2328
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:36,660
He threw me out next round.

2329
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:38,560
And then me after that.

2330
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:42,380
I can't help it if you guys are all bad at being the imposter.

2331
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:43,140
You know, what am I meant to do?

2332
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:45,160
Dude, I'm a great assistant here.

2333
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:46,900
You make me want to gouge my eyes out.

2334
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:50,280
And then you snip.

2335
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:53,000
Not the slacker trying to play foolish.

2336
01:07:53,180 --> 01:07:54,120
That was crazy.

2337
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:58,020
This is an intentional bingo at this point.

2338
01:07:58,740 --> 01:08:00,140
It's a reverse bingo, Shadow.

2339
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:01,180
It's a reverse bingo.

2340
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:03,960
That's not it.

2341
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:13,260
I want to apologize to you, but I actually can't.

2342
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:13,960
I'm so mad.

2343
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:19,540
No, I'm not apologizing.

2344
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,400
Better hope he's not manager next round.

2345
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,160
We can vote him out as manager.

2346
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:27,020
Remember, guys?

2347
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:28,520
Yeah, yeah.

2348
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:32,300
Yeah, you can vote out the manager.

2349
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:32,780
Manager.

2350
01:08:33,220 --> 01:08:35,080
You can't be trusted anywhere.

2351
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:37,600
LM, give the manager to somebody else.

2352
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:38,340
Oh, yeah.

2353
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:39,700
No, I'm going to give the manager to someone.

2354
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:40,280
That's for sure.

2355
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:42,000
We already know who it is.

2356
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:44,500
Who is it?

2357
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:45,860
I think we're missing two people.

2358
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:46,920
Oh, shit.

2359
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:47,300
Coming.

2360
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:50,340
Tina and Janet.

2361
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:53,700
I was customizing.

2362
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:54,440
Me too.

2363
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:55,720
Wait, you customize your characters?

2364
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:56,260
Yeah, you can.

2365
01:08:56,260 --> 01:08:58,840
You can customize your characters.

2366
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:00,520
So, go back to the main lobby.

2367
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:01,640
I need money.

2368
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:04,980
You've been getting some in the game.

2369
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:05,260
Yeah.

2370
01:09:05,260 --> 01:09:07,480
I spent it all already.

2371
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:15,040
Guys, I drew a picture on my computer and printed it out and then Janet and Donkey hung it up on the wall.

2372
01:09:15,540 --> 01:09:16,100
Yeah.

2373
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:20,780
It's like a child getting a picture hanged on the fridge.

2374
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:22,500
Do it again.

2375
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:23,140
Do it again.

2376
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:24,280
Do it again, please.

2377
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:26,560
And they were like, oh my gosh, that's amazing.

2378
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,280
We're like the mom and dad.

2379
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:35,500
We're like, oh, congratulations.

2380
01:09:37,860 --> 01:09:38,820
Whoa, guys.

2381
01:09:38,980 --> 01:09:40,720
I guess I'll be the manager.

2382
01:09:41,820 --> 01:09:42,300
Oh.

2383
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:46,580
Ellen, you are doing an amazing job, Ellen.

2384
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:47,300
I think.

2385
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:49,200
Ellen, great job, Ellen.

2386
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:50,660
Good job.

2387
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:54,540
I'm going to raise out to get you.

2388
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:57,700
I guess I got to call a meeting now.

2389
01:09:57,780 --> 01:09:59,000
I guess I got to call a meeting now.

2390
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:00,500
Ellen, you're not muted, Ellen.

2391
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:01,860
You're not muted on Discord.

2392
01:10:02,820 --> 01:10:03,220
Sorry.

2393
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:05,560
I'm ready.

2394
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:06,140
Okay.

2395
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:07,380
Shake my hand.

2396
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:10,620
It's been a good one, man.

2397
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:11,680
It's been a good one.

2398
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:14,560
Are we having an orientation?

2399
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:17,360
Oh, wait.

2400
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:17,760
Is it four?

2401
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:19,240
Give me one good reason.

2402
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:22,260
Give me one good reason.

2403
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:24,440
Don't you dare touch her.

2404
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:25,460
Fire me.

2405
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:27,920
Here, I'll give you a reason.

2406
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:28,980
Back away.

2407
01:10:30,620 --> 01:10:32,060
Is that what you want to do?

2408
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:34,260
You know that's what he wants to do, Ray.

2409
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:35,940
You know that's what he wants to do.

2410
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:39,340
He's already done it twice.

2411
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:40,700
No.

2412
01:10:40,980 --> 01:10:42,380
We already let this happen.

2413
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:43,260
Oh.

2414
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:44,640
Why?

2415
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:46,160
Why?

2416
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:47,080
Why?

2417
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:49,580
Wait, she was imposter.

2418
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:50,480
Okay.

2419
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:51,200
Oh, good job.

2420
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:52,620
Well, you're really good at this job.

2421
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:54,560
Wait, yeah.

2422
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:56,540
Maybe you're really good at magic.

2423
01:10:56,740 --> 01:10:57,520
Good job.

2424
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:00,320
Good job.

2425
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:01,820
Good job.

2426
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:04,340
You did great.

2427
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:05,940
Thank you so much.

2428
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:07,080
Excellent work.

2429
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:08,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2430
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:09,340
Excellent work.

2431
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:15,100
Tina?

2432
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:17,800
No, I do.

2433
01:11:19,580 --> 01:11:21,300
I just loaded you out and you were imposter.

2434
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:22,220
Yeah, I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

2435
01:11:22,220 --> 01:11:23,300
It was sick, actually.

2436
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:24,340
Yeah, I'm sorry.

2437
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:27,780
I'm sorry, Tina, that this happened to you.

2438
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:30,800
Well, no, too bad, because you fired me, so now you all have a computer.

2439
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:31,280
Oh, fuck.

2440
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:33,760
Enjoy your new job as a judge.

2441
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:37,540
He's a slacker and he fired his teammate.

2442
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:38,740
Whoa.

2443
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:39,200
Shut up.

2444
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:40,040
Don't say that.

2445
01:11:40,820 --> 01:11:42,880
Listen, let's think.

2446
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:45,260
He always hints his teammates when he's a slacker.

2447
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:46,320
Okay, true.

2448
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:47,780
And this is the best way to convince you he's innocent.

2449
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:51,020
Let's pretend to feed the cat.

2450
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:52,700
Do you think that made him look better?

2451
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:53,880
Why is there still a fire?

2452
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:57,580
Do they not realize there was a fire?

2453
01:11:57,700 --> 01:11:58,860
Do you think he knew somehow?

2454
01:11:59,060 --> 01:11:59,680
There was no hint.

2455
01:11:59,740 --> 01:12:00,440
The game just started.

2456
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:03,620
He voted out his own teammate to try and convince him.

2457
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:07,540
Guys, I don't think they realized there was a fire right next to them.

2458
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:08,060
You know what?

2459
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:10,080
I'm voting against him.

2460
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:11,440
Vote against!

2461
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:13,520
Oh, it got put out.

2462
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:14,140
That was fast.

2463
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:15,520
Okay, that was really fast.

2464
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:16,560
Okay.

2465
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:17,860
Oh, it's the same one!

2466
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:20,780
Alright, let's see.

2467
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:25,480
It's gonna be so funny.

2468
01:12:25,820 --> 01:12:27,340
It's gonna be so funny.

2469
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:30,760
Where's my drink?

2470
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:32,980
Alright, we're gonna...

2471
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:35,300
We're gonna get some coffee.

2472
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:36,520
Wait, that's not coffee.

2473
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:38,480
Oh, I need to grab... Oh, beer!

2474
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:40,800
Alright, don't worry.

2475
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:41,840
I have a plan, guys.

2476
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:43,000
I'm gonna grab the beer.

2477
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,600
I'm gonna drink the beer.

2478
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:45,740
And then...

2479
01:12:45,740 --> 01:12:47,640
I'm gonna give the beer to...

2480
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:50,420
I'm gonna give the beer to the manager.

2481
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:52,040
Don't worry.

2482
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:52,600
And then...

2483
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:56,280
He won't suspect a thing.

2484
01:12:56,740 --> 01:12:57,780
Is that Garfield?

2485
01:12:58,740 --> 01:12:59,740
Wait, what?

2486
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:01,300
Why is there me?

2487
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:03,400
Okay, I'm gonna drop this.

2488
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:07,540
We're the framers.

2489
01:13:07,780 --> 01:13:09,860
Vote for what?

2490
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:11,460
I didn't vote!

2491
01:13:11,660 --> 01:13:12,420
I didn't vote!

2492
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:13,680
What are we voting for?

2493
01:13:14,780 --> 01:13:15,900
Is it vote against?

2494
01:13:16,220 --> 01:13:16,920
Yeah, vote for.

2495
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:19,320
Vote for because we're replacing.

2496
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:20,240
Yeah!

2497
01:13:24,820 --> 01:13:26,180
Oh, the server!

2498
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:26,820
It's the server!

2499
01:13:27,260 --> 01:13:28,500
Oh wait, that's not the server.

2500
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:30,000
No, no, no, no, no.

2501
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:30,660
It's the...

2502
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:34,940
It's the meeting, I think.

2503
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:37,420
I think the manager has to do a meeting, but he doesn't know.

2504
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:47,660
Okay.

2505
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:50,220
Let's get to it!

2506
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:51,040
What do you have, Dakin?

2507
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:52,500
Yeah, you snitched on me.

2508
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:53,320
You're taking the shit for Shoto.

2509
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,120
What did I snitch on you?

2510
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:56,900
At the last firm.

2511
01:13:57,160 --> 01:13:58,440
I'm not even talking to you, honestly.

2512
01:13:58,440 --> 01:13:59,340
At the last firm?

2513
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:00,580
You know what?

2514
01:14:00,700 --> 01:14:02,600
You know what?

2515
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:03,400
It smells...

2516
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:05,500
Still, Dakin, could you actually move back a step?

2517
01:14:06,260 --> 01:14:07,440
Move back a step!

2518
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:07,740
Did you?

2519
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:08,480
Right then!

2520
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:09,820
You stink!

2521
01:14:11,220 --> 01:14:14,540
LM, there are people voting to replace you.

2522
01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:16,220
He's landering his employees!

2523
01:14:16,220 --> 01:14:17,600
He's landering his employees!

2524
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:28,080
Do it now!

2525
01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:30,280
Congratulations!

2526
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:31,100
Congratulations!

2527
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,260
I always believe you'll get there!

2528
01:14:33,740 --> 01:14:34,640
You need to fire someone.

2529
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:36,240
I didn't fire someone!

2530
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:38,280
I always believed in you.

2531
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:42,240
Did you...

2532
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:44,740
Did you think... Okay, well...

2533
01:14:44,740 --> 01:14:45,560
Yeah, we could've talked in a little bit.

2534
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:47,500
Yeah, you had time.

2535
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:49,300
You sort of had time.

2536
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:50,200
Yeah.

2537
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:55,060
You know, it's kind of crazy that you guys are all telling me all of this.

2538
01:14:55,060 --> 01:14:56,540
Janet, I think you did a great job, Janet.

2539
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:00,880
I think you did a great job, and honestly, like, you didn't deserve the pressure.

2540
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:02,060
You didn't deserve it.

2541
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:02,960
This is your first day.

2542
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:04,620
This is your first try, you know?

2543
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:05,920
Excellent work.

2544
01:15:05,980 --> 01:15:06,480
Excellent work.

2545
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:08,120
Wait, how do I...

2546
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:08,640
How do I clap?

2547
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:11,320
Of course, of course, Ms. Manager.

2548
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:12,740
I'm watching over every...

2549
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:21,520
I'm watching over every single one of you.

2550
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:22,800
Okay, I need to start a fire.

2551
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:26,560
What?

2552
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,560
The printer is, like, back here.

2553
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,600
Isn't it all the way over here?

2554
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:40,080
It's over here!

2555
01:15:40,220 --> 01:15:41,120
Oh wait, no, that's not it.

2556
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:43,120
It's over here!

2557
01:15:43,220 --> 01:15:43,600
It's over here!

2558
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:44,500
It's over here.

2559
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:45,500
It's a copier room.

2560
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:47,400
Yeah, see?

2561
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:47,700
See?

2562
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:48,420
I knew it.

2563
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:50,800
I told you I knew it.

2564
01:15:53,380 --> 01:15:53,880
Alright.

2565
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:05,300
Jenna, I think you're doing a great job.

2566
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:08,480
In my country, that's a compliment.

2567
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:11,260
Oh, thank you so much.

2568
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:11,940
Yeah, yeah.

2569
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:15,000
Okay.

2570
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:21,920
Okay.

2571
01:16:22,220 --> 01:16:22,480
Okay.

2572
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:24,960
No, why do I always have to drink?

2573
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:26,320
I'm tired of drinking!

2574
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,060
I'm so fucking tired!

2575
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,320
I don't want to drink anymore!

2576
01:16:34,060 --> 01:16:36,100
I'm becoming an alcoholic!

2577
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:38,860
Wait.

2578
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:41,980
Wait, where's my...

2579
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:42,920
I don't want to...

2580
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:44,080
You got me fired at the last friend.

2581
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:44,920
I don't want to be...

2582
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:46,740
I don't want to be an alcoholic anymore!

2583
01:16:47,140 --> 01:16:49,520
I want to pretend to work for real!

2584
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:50,900
I'm tired!

2585
01:16:51,620 --> 01:16:54,140
I'm tired of being an alcoholic!

2586
01:16:57,540 --> 01:16:58,980
I'm so tired!

2587
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:01,640
I don't want to be an alcoholic anymore!

2588
01:17:03,580 --> 01:17:05,120
Ty, you're better than me.

2589
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:07,040
Uh, I kinda am.

2590
01:17:09,220 --> 01:17:10,320
Wait, what are you on?

2591
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:12,640
Is that your desk?

2592
01:17:12,860 --> 01:17:14,080
Oh, yeah, that is your desk.

2593
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,160
Yeah, we're desk buddies.

2594
01:17:16,420 --> 01:17:17,600
Look, we're desk buddies!

2595
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:19,220
Wait, is this...

2596
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:19,940
Wait, what's going on?

2597
01:17:20,180 --> 01:17:23,000
I'm trying to call the manager, but she won't pick up the phone.

2598
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:24,520
Is that a fire?

2599
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:25,800
I'm trying to call the manager.

2600
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:26,260
Is that a fire?

2601
01:17:26,660 --> 01:17:27,660
No, that's the meeting.

2602
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:30,900
Why is my manager not picking it up?

2603
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:31,120
Oh!

2604
01:17:32,740 --> 01:17:33,780
I don't want to...

2605
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:35,080
I'm trying to call...

2606
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:38,340
Who do you...

2607
01:17:38,340 --> 01:17:39,100
Who do you think...

2608
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:42,020
Well, there's people not in the meeting right now.

2609
01:17:42,340 --> 01:17:42,980
Janet, you have time.

2610
01:17:42,980 --> 01:17:43,460
I'm not gonna lie.

2611
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:44,560
I thought it was a fire.

2612
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:45,380
I kinda got confused.

2613
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:45,660
No, you don't.

2614
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:46,860
Yes, I did.

2615
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:47,120
Okay.

2616
01:17:47,180 --> 01:17:47,820
Oh, you got time.

2617
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:49,240
Can you sign this?

2618
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:50,800
Yes.

2619
01:17:52,020 --> 01:17:52,560
Let's see.

2620
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:53,560
Oh!

2621
01:17:53,980 --> 01:17:54,340
Oh!

2622
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:55,100
Oh!

2623
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:55,540
It's okay.

2624
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:56,820
She learned that from me.

2625
01:17:56,820 --> 01:17:58,740
In my country, it's a compliment.

2626
01:17:59,100 --> 01:17:59,400
Oh, she's your manager.

2627
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:00,420
Oh!

2628
01:18:00,580 --> 01:18:01,140
That was a move.

2629
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:01,840
Yeah, yeah.

2630
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:04,600
She's the manager in HR, so you can't complain.

2631
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:05,120
My turn.

2632
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:05,560
My turn.

2633
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:05,860
My turn.

2634
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:06,080
Okay.

2635
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:06,840
Oh!

2636
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:08,280
Oh!

2637
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:09,240
Okay.

2638
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:09,760
Thank you.

2639
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:13,300
Okay.

2640
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:23,320
Even though I signed that for you, MeeYang, I can't help but notice that I stood behind your shoulder and you were playing Minesweeper, and I know Neutrals can play Minesweeper, but like you were enjoying it a little too much.

2641
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:23,880
No, that's...

2642
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:24,220
Yeah.

2643
01:18:24,460 --> 01:18:25,780
You should be...

2644
01:18:25,780 --> 01:18:26,600
No way!

2645
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:28,460
She needs a break.

2646
01:18:28,460 --> 01:18:29,280
She just needed a break.

2647
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:29,580
Okay.

2648
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:32,940
But on company time, we have break rooms for a reason.

2649
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:37,540
We have break rooms for a reason.

2650
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:38,620
Okay.

2651
01:18:38,620 --> 01:18:39,620
For the good of the company.

2652
01:18:39,620 --> 01:18:39,700
Oh, no.

2653
01:18:39,700 --> 01:18:39,720
Okay.

2654
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:39,740
Oh, you can't see that.

2655
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:42,000
Goodbye, Janet.

2656
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:43,400
Goodbye.

2657
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:45,220
For the good of the company.

2658
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:45,840
Goodbye.

2659
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,400
Where did Shoto go?

2660
01:18:57,720 --> 01:19:00,020
Shoto isn't even in the meeting!

2661
01:19:01,860 --> 01:19:03,040
Oh, Shoto!

2662
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:04,900
You deserved it.

2663
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,120
Congratulations on your promotion.

2664
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:07,700
Congrats.

2665
01:19:08,140 --> 01:19:09,300
Oh, thank you so much.

2666
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:09,620
Congratulations.

2667
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:10,980
Oh, sorry.

2668
01:19:11,020 --> 01:19:11,640
I sat down.

2669
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:15,020
I sat down because I wanted to give you a clap for your promotion.

2670
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:16,100
Congratulations.

2671
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:17,260
Congratulations.

2672
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:20,680
You did your best, honestly.

2673
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:21,500
You know?

2674
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,180
Oh, we have to fix the server.

2675
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:26,220
Wait!

2676
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:27,760
Foolish, did you crash the server?

2677
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:29,360
No, no, no!

2678
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:31,780
I've been monitoring because it takes like 10 seconds, okay?

2679
01:19:32,940 --> 01:19:36,540
So Shoto walked in here at the very beginning and then came back, so I think it has to be Shoto.

2680
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:38,280
Wait, Shoto, did you crash...

2681
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:40,000
Shoto, did you saw who crashed the server?

2682
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:40,920
I am the manager.

2683
01:19:41,180 --> 01:19:41,700
What do you mean?

2684
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:42,160
Yeah!

2685
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:45,500
Foolish said it was you that... Foolish is trying to blame the manager.

2686
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:46,880
I didn't believe him.

2687
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:47,880
Why are you trying to blame the manager?

2688
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:50,400
Don't spank me!

2689
01:19:55,380 --> 01:19:56,480
Don't spank me.

2690
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:00,160
Stupid, stupid, ugly.

2691
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:01,180
So ugly.

2692
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:02,900
Oh, shit.

2693
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:04,740
Okay, I'm going to pretend to do work, guys.

2694
01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:05,420
Where's my PC?

2695
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:09,800
Okay, I'm going to call the manager.

2696
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:16,720
Do you think the manager will take the call?

2697
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:18,620
Hello?

2698
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:20,300
I'm trying to call the manager.

2699
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:24,680
I'm trying to call the manager right now.

2700
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:25,700
I have problems.

2701
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:28,040
I need the manager to sort it out.

2702
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:29,060
Hello?

2703
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:30,340
Hello?

2704
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:32,420
Manager?

2705
01:20:32,980 --> 01:20:33,880
Is that you?

2706
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:35,660
Hello?

2707
01:20:37,380 --> 01:20:38,680
He hanged up!

2708
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:44,460
He hanged up the phone!

2709
01:20:47,780 --> 01:20:48,260
Mr.

2710
01:20:51,460 --> 01:20:53,380
Manager, why did you hang up on my call?

2711
01:20:53,460 --> 01:20:54,800
I had a very important call.

2712
01:20:55,380 --> 01:20:57,160
Okay, I'll give you a hint, Shoto.

2713
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:58,420
It's a Star Rail character.

2714
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:00,520
Sparkle.

2715
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:02,380
Sparkle?

2716
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:04,180
Oh, blue!

2717
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:08,760
Dude, he's just thinking about Sparkle.

2718
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:09,460
He's got a problem.

2719
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:11,300
How about all the blues?

2720
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:13,320
I mean, she is one of my favorites.

2721
01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:14,580
Zilla!

2722
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:14,980
Zilla!

2723
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:15,440
Zilla!

2724
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:15,700
Yeah!

2725
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:16,280
Oh, yeah!

2726
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:16,940
Wait!

2727
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:18,000
Yeah, you did get it!

2728
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:18,280
Nice!

2729
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:18,920
Oh, wait!

2730
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:19,860
I didn't need to do that!

2731
01:21:19,860 --> 01:21:20,880
I didn't need to do that!

2732
01:21:21,260 --> 01:21:21,620
Damn!

2733
01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:23,320
You're already demoting?

2734
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:25,560
Oh, damn!

2735
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:27,900
Call a meeting!

2736
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:28,600
Call a meeting!

2737
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:32,240
No, we're already in a meeting.

2738
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:35,940
He only likes Sparkle.

2739
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:36,260
I see.

2740
01:21:36,260 --> 01:21:36,700
It's okay.

2741
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:38,580
No, you have another... Yeah, you can... You have time.

2742
01:21:38,620 --> 01:21:39,000
You have time.

2743
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:43,680
He called the meeting so we could look at the beautiful bulletin board, right?

2744
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:44,300
Is that it?

2745
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:45,000
Wait, wait.

2746
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:46,440
Wait, Foolish, you look a little tired.

2747
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:47,260
I have a hunch who it is.

2748
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:47,900
You wanna get some coffee?

2749
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:53,880
Alright, put it in pick up.

2750
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:54,200
Oh!

2751
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:57,600
What if I infected my own PC?

2752
01:22:01,860 --> 01:22:03,640
How do I... Oh, I... Good job.

2753
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:04,280
Good job, Doki.

2754
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:04,820
Good job.

2755
01:22:04,860 --> 01:22:05,440
You did great.

2756
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:17,480
Oh!

2757
01:22:17,820 --> 01:22:19,340
I didn't have to do anything.

2758
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:22,760
What's going on?

2759
01:22:22,780 --> 01:22:23,400
What is that?

2760
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:24,440
Sticky note you have there.

2761
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:25,660
I'm watching you.

2762
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:28,180
Tina, what... What are you doing?

2763
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:31,140
Are you harassing a worker?

2764
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:33,460
No, no, no.

2765
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:35,980
No, she's harassing somebody!

2766
01:22:36,260 --> 01:22:37,420
Look what she dropped!

2767
01:22:38,020 --> 01:22:38,580
Vote Shoto out!

2768
01:22:38,740 --> 01:22:40,300
We gotta vote Shoto out!

2769
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:42,420
Oh, vote Shoto out?

2770
01:22:42,620 --> 01:22:43,100
Yeah, yeah.

2771
01:22:43,180 --> 01:22:43,580
Thank you.

2772
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:44,240
Vote Shoto out!

2773
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:44,780
Fast!

2774
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:45,200
Fast!

2775
01:22:45,780 --> 01:22:46,360
Alright, alright.

2776
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:47,220
Vote him out.

2777
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:47,920
Vote him out.

2778
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:48,840
You gotta fire her!

2779
01:22:48,860 --> 01:22:49,880
Wait, who taught us this, man?

2780
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:50,560
Oh.

2781
01:22:52,020 --> 01:22:52,380
Oh.

2782
01:22:52,860 --> 01:22:52,900
Oh.

2783
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:53,920
This is not good.

2784
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:54,900
This is not good.

2785
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:55,800
Oh!

2786
01:22:56,140 --> 01:22:56,900
Wait a second.

2787
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:57,680
The goat.

2788
01:22:57,880 --> 01:22:58,480
And why did he...

2789
01:22:59,100 --> 01:22:59,820
Terminate... Oh!

2790
01:23:00,020 --> 01:23:01,440
Oh, it's cause we're still in the meeting!

2791
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:02,520
You still have a chance!

2792
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:03,400
We're still in the meeting!

2793
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:05,740
Okay, uh, this is really...

2794
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:07,460
Wait, we're already dead.

2795
01:23:07,700 --> 01:23:08,780
Zero terminations.

2796
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:09,400
We're done.

2797
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:09,980
We're over.

2798
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:10,480
It's cooked.

2799
01:23:10,540 --> 01:23:11,840
No, but the meeting is in progress.

2800
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:13,480
You can do... You can hit one more shot.

2801
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:14,800
The meeting is in progress.

2802
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:17,960
Well, Sakuto got two people voted out when they were specialists.

2803
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:19,580
Wait, I did?

2804
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:20,460
When did I do that?

2805
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:22,400
Yes, you got... Oh...

2806
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:23,780
You got...

2807
01:23:23,780 --> 01:23:24,620
I wish I did.

2808
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:26,240
I don't think I have the... the credit.

2809
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:26,700
It's over.

2810
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:27,820
It's over.

2811
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:29,500
It's over.

2812
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:30,940
It's over.

2813
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:32,740
It's over.

2814
01:23:32,940 --> 01:23:33,760
It's over.

2815
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:34,200
It's over.

2816
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:34,220
It's over.

2817
01:23:34,220 --> 01:23:34,980
Oh, that's a good job.

2818
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:35,820
Oh.

2819
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:37,020
What?

2820
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:38,260
We cried!

2821
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:40,300
Wait, how did you guys...

2822
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:42,160
We're all the specialists.

2823
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:43,060
That ain't...

2824
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:44,560
We're all managers.

2825
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:47,480
My god, I thought Sakuto was sus.

2826
01:23:48,340 --> 01:23:48,860
Yes!

2827
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:50,960
I mean, it was just Sakuto, really.

2828
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:55,560
How did they... they voted for every specialist except for...

2829
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:57,880
Can a limited poster guy ever become manager?

2830
01:23:58,100 --> 01:24:00,360
I don't think so, right?

2831
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:01,520
Yes.

2832
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:01,580
Oh.

2833
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:02,380
Wait, really?

2834
01:24:02,660 --> 01:24:02,940
What?

2835
01:24:03,060 --> 01:24:03,660
Did I make that up?

2836
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:05,200
Wait, wasn't Janet one?

2837
01:24:06,020 --> 01:24:08,580
You can be an assistant, but I don't think you can be a manager.

2838
01:24:08,740 --> 01:24:11,680
No, you... No, like, slackers can't be managers.

2839
01:24:11,820 --> 01:24:12,360
Only assistants.

2840
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:13,040
You can never be manager.

2841
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:13,040
You can never be manager.

2842
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:13,040
You can never be manager.

2843
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:13,040
You can never be manager.

2844
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:13,040
You can never be manager.

2845
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:13,040
You can never be manager.

2846
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:13,040
You can never be manager.

2847
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:13,240
You can never be manager.

2848
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:13,240
You can never be manager.

2849
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:13,580
Were you just red, then?

2850
01:24:14,820 --> 01:24:16,260
Uh, I guess so.

2851
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:16,560
I think so.

2852
01:24:16,740 --> 01:24:16,760
Yeah.

2853
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:17,660
I was good, though.

2854
01:24:17,660 --> 01:24:19,340
Oh, I thought you were a bad guy this whole time.

2855
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:20,360
I thought we were in for a hoon.

2856
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:20,720
What is that?

2857
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:21,340
What the...

2858
01:24:21,340 --> 01:24:22,500
That's helpful information.

2859
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:26,040
Oh, chat says managers... slackers can't be managers.

2860
01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:26,480
Never.

2861
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:27,660
Yes, slackers can't be managers.

2862
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:28,400
Oh.

2863
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:29,700
You didn't know that.

2864
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:33,260
Janet was role-playing that she was gonna take my job, and two minutes later, she took my job.

2865
01:24:34,860 --> 01:24:36,520
She just worked harder, LM.

2866
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:37,260
What can I say?

2867
01:24:37,700 --> 01:24:38,060
Yeah.

2868
01:24:38,060 --> 01:24:38,980
She just worked harder, man.

2869
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:40,760
Yeah, she just... she just worked a little harder.

2870
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:43,480
I manifested that sh!t.

2871
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:47,500
New map, new map.

2872
01:24:47,740 --> 01:24:50,120
Oh yeah, is there any specific ones you guys want?

2873
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:51,140
Is there any we haven't done yet?

2874
01:24:51,140 --> 01:24:51,400
Denmark.

2875
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:55,260
We can do that one.

2876
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:55,840
Yeah, let's do it.

2877
01:24:56,140 --> 01:24:56,840
Oh, wait, wait.

2878
01:24:57,020 --> 01:24:57,480
I'm not in.

2879
01:24:57,580 --> 01:24:57,980
I'm coming.

2880
01:24:58,800 --> 01:24:59,800
Oh, I need to go in.

2881
01:25:01,660 --> 01:25:03,080
We are missing...

2882
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:04,420
I'm on the way!

2883
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:05,720
I'm in!

2884
01:25:06,540 --> 01:25:08,900
Could you only speak Danish the whole time?

2885
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:10,540
Honestly, I'll be out of time.

2886
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:12,300
Wait, are we in Denmark now?

2887
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:13,800
We're in Denmark.

2888
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:15,180
Oh my god, we all got our visas.

2889
01:25:15,700 --> 01:25:16,220
Copenhagen!

2890
01:25:16,340 --> 01:25:18,840
We are missing one person.

2891
01:25:18,940 --> 01:25:19,240
Are you ready?

2892
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:22,600
Who's the one person that's missing?

2893
01:25:23,900 --> 01:25:25,120
Let's lose it out.

2894
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:26,720
I'm willing to guess it.

2895
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:27,260
It's Shodo.

2896
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:30,160
Good sleuthing, good sleuthing.

2897
01:25:30,340 --> 01:25:31,800
I would like to take a moment to...

2898
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:33,020
Probably taking a shower.

2899
01:25:33,660 --> 01:25:34,620
I'm right here.

2900
01:25:35,820 --> 01:25:38,060
Taking a shower is crazy.

2901
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:40,380
You need a food break.

2902
01:25:40,380 --> 01:25:42,940
Working in the office is very stressful.

2903
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,320
We all need a food break.

2904
01:25:44,540 --> 01:25:44,980
Spick and span.

2905
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:47,020
Dinner just showed up.

2906
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:49,400
That's supposed to make sense.

2907
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:52,800
Spick and span.

2908
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:53,500
No, that makes sense.

2909
01:25:53,860 --> 01:25:54,460
What does that mean?

2910
01:25:55,660 --> 01:25:56,440
Spick and span.

2911
01:25:57,460 --> 01:26:00,240
You're saying that like that solved everything.

2912
01:26:00,660 --> 01:26:01,680
It does solve everything.

2913
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,260
When we get into the next game.

2914
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:05,320
Ready.

2915
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:06,300
I'm ready.

2916
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:09,640
You can have 21 players?

2917
01:26:09,900 --> 01:26:10,640
Oh my god.

2918
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:12,220
I can't imagine.

2919
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:13,980
It's always Tina.

2920
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:16,600
21 players but nobody is going to get work done.

2921
01:26:16,860 --> 01:26:18,340
I thought that the no lines meant I was ready.

2922
01:26:19,820 --> 01:26:20,660
Yeah, I know.

2923
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:24,700
Because the other one means you're crossed out.

2924
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:25,660
So you're not ready.

2925
01:26:25,980 --> 01:26:27,280
No, it's like you're crossed in.

2926
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:30,440
Check the box.

2927
01:26:30,460 --> 01:26:30,660
Check the box.

2928
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:34,200
Don't get me mad at you.

2929
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:35,220
I hope I'm not mad at you.

2930
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:35,500
Oh, nice.

2931
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:37,180
Alright, guys.

2932
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:38,980
I'm good.

2933
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:42,800
Who's that?

2934
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:45,540
Congratulations.

2935
01:26:46,380 --> 01:26:46,860
Congratulations.

2936
01:26:49,540 --> 01:26:50,020
Congratulations.

2937
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:50,260
Congratulations.

2938
01:26:50,420 --> 01:26:53,400
Even though you already promoted assistant, I still say congratulations.

2939
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:54,240
You did amazing.

2940
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:55,520
I knew you deserved it.

2941
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:58,200
You worked so hard.

2942
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:03,000
Manager, the door has been locked.

2943
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:04,960
Get her out of here, guys.

2944
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,280
Okay, meeting starting.

2945
01:27:07,340 --> 01:27:08,160
Are we having orientation?

2946
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:12,580
I don't know.

2947
01:27:12,700 --> 01:27:13,580
I guess so.

2948
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:14,540
Is this normal?

2949
01:27:15,380 --> 01:27:16,500
Hello, new manager.

2950
01:27:17,220 --> 01:27:18,140
Of course you did.

2951
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:20,940
Everything you do is intentional, right, manager?

2952
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:21,900
You know what you're doing.

2953
01:27:22,180 --> 01:27:22,680
You're the best.

2954
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:24,880
Thank you so much.

2955
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:28,320
The manager can do no wrong.

2956
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:30,040
True.

2957
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:33,320
We can't miss our first meeting at a new company.

2958
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:34,200
Of course.

2959
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:35,520
We're here for our orientation.

2960
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:39,080
Manager, when will we get our sensitivity training?

2961
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:40,700
Everyone applaud now.

2962
01:27:40,940 --> 01:27:42,560
Applaud for our manager.

2963
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:43,280
Of course.

2964
01:27:43,460 --> 01:27:44,740
I'll hail our new manager.

2965
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:46,800
Everyone applaud.

2966
01:27:47,020 --> 01:27:51,880
If you're not applauding, you're probably slacking off on the job.

2967
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:52,900
That's what I think.

2968
01:27:53,060 --> 01:27:53,100
I'm really drunk.

2969
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:58,280
No, you have time.

2970
01:27:59,000 --> 01:27:59,800
Just end it.

2971
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:01,120
It's just an orientation.

2972
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:02,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2973
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:04,280
Thank you so much for the applause.

2974
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:06,020
Saikuno is holding the keys and being a manager.

2975
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:07,160
Please take care.

2976
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:10,200
Me too.

2977
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:11,340
I love working here.

2978
01:28:11,420 --> 01:28:12,460
It's my favorite job.

2979
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:14,800
Maybe we have to get the coach to try.

2980
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:21,100
Where's my PC?

2981
01:28:22,340 --> 01:28:23,480
Wait, that was my PC.

2982
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:25,520
Yes!

2983
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:33,540
That was my PC.

2984
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:36,280
Okay.

2985
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:38,240
Back to work I go.

2986
01:28:38,820 --> 01:28:40,340
Wait, I got my own office.

2987
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:41,600
They'll never know.

2988
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,040
Oh my god.

2989
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:44,920
They'll never know.

2990
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:47,700
I got my own office.

2991
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:49,080
How could they tell?

2992
01:28:49,580 --> 01:28:50,840
That was my task.

2993
01:28:51,300 --> 01:28:54,220
I have an evil task above it.

2994
01:28:54,380 --> 01:28:56,820
Do I have to contact HR?

2995
01:28:57,240 --> 01:28:59,260
We have HR?

2996
01:28:59,660 --> 01:29:00,580
Wait, who's our HR?

2997
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:02,360
I'm having a little drink right now.

2998
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:04,460
Who's our HR?

2999
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:06,420
What about you guys?

3000
01:29:07,580 --> 01:29:08,760
Jenner's just the HR.

3001
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:09,620
Jenner, you're HR?

3002
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:11,160
What's wrong?

3003
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:12,940
I have an HR complaint.

3004
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:14,620
Somebody started a fire.

3005
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:15,480
What happened?

3006
01:29:15,820 --> 01:29:18,120
Somebody started a fire, Ms. HR.

3007
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:20,640
Why would you call this before the fire happened?

3008
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:22,280
I put out the fire.

3009
01:29:22,340 --> 01:29:23,620
Don't worry, I put out the fire.

3010
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:26,360
Interesting.

3011
01:29:32,060 --> 01:29:33,820
Wait, where's the manager?

3012
01:29:33,900 --> 01:29:34,660
Not like...

3013
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:37,680
Just for the sake of it.

3014
01:29:37,700 --> 01:29:38,260
Just for the sake of it.

3015
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:40,840
Everyone aboard!

3016
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:43,780
Hurry, we start off the meetings with a plotting to the manager.

3017
01:29:43,940 --> 01:29:44,580
Oh yeah, you're right.

3018
01:29:44,660 --> 01:29:45,180
You're the best.

3019
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:46,640
Best manager, honestly.

3020
01:29:47,140 --> 01:29:50,040
Sock prices are rising because of your decisions, Ms. Ray.

3021
01:29:51,940 --> 01:29:54,940
I'll have you know, our stock prices rose 20% today.

3022
01:29:56,180 --> 01:29:56,920
I'll have you know, our stock prices rose 20% today.

3023
01:29:57,740 --> 01:29:58,780
I'll have you know, our stock prices rose 20% today.

3024
01:29:58,780 --> 01:30:00,380
Only because of Ray.

3025
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:03,000
Wait, wait, can I talk?

3026
01:30:03,240 --> 01:30:04,120
Wait, wait, can I talk?

3027
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:06,280
Guys, let's not...

3028
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:09,380
I think it was...

3029
01:30:09,380 --> 01:30:11,660
It was Janet, and it was Shoto.

3030
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:12,440
We saw...

3031
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:14,820
We could easily vote out out of fire.

3032
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:15,860
I said out of fire.

3033
01:30:15,900 --> 01:30:17,140
Wait, how did I?

3034
01:30:17,420 --> 01:30:17,740
What?

3035
01:30:18,260 --> 01:30:19,680
I was just saying HR.

3036
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:21,680
I was calling HR.

3037
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:24,560
I was calling HR.

3038
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:25,980
I was calling HR.

3039
01:30:25,980 --> 01:30:27,340
And then a fire showed up.

3040
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:29,020
No!

3041
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:31,960
Wait, how?

3042
01:30:32,540 --> 01:30:33,960
I actually did nothing.

3043
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:35,740
I didn't start the fire.

3044
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:37,700
I didn't even start the fire.

3045
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:41,440
I didn't even start the fire.

3046
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:44,320
And then it was trying to call HR.

3047
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:48,600
I can't believe it.

3048
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:52,340
I didn't even start the fire.

3049
01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:53,940
I got blamed.

3050
01:30:55,260 --> 01:30:57,100
I got blamed.

3051
01:30:59,180 --> 01:31:02,000
My team betrayed me.

3052
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:03,820
I'm gonna fucking put everybody...

3053
01:31:04,120 --> 01:31:05,200
thing in jello.

3054
01:31:05,910 --> 01:31:06,560
Fuck this.

3055
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:08,400
I'm gonna start every fire.

3056
01:31:08,660 --> 01:31:12,200
I'm gonna put everybody's thing in jello now.

3057
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:13,860
That's fucking right.

3058
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:14,960
This is your fault.

3059
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,080
I did nothing wrong.

3060
01:31:18,180 --> 01:31:19,640
Great, great, yeah.

3061
01:31:19,780 --> 01:31:21,640
You know, the stay at home dad.

3062
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:23,440
Just taking care of the kids.

3063
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:25,500
It's a lovely life.

3064
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:26,960
What's your son's name?

3065
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:29,740
I can't even start the fire.

3066
01:31:29,860 --> 01:31:30,880
What's the point?

3067
01:31:33,940 --> 01:31:35,440
What's the point?

3068
01:31:35,460 --> 01:31:36,360
What's the point?

3069
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:38,940
I can't even start the fire.

3070
01:31:39,260 --> 01:31:41,340
I can't even start the fire.

3071
01:31:41,340 --> 01:31:42,600
This is it.

3072
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:44,780
This Janner is going fucking rogue.

3073
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:46,500
This Janner is going fucking rogue.

3074
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:49,500
This Janner is gonna put everything in jello.

3075
01:31:49,700 --> 01:31:49,780
This Janner is gonna put everything in jello.

3076
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:52,560
Nobody can stop me.

3077
01:31:52,900 --> 01:31:53,420
Nobody can stop me.

3078
01:31:53,420 --> 01:31:54,700
That's right.

3079
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:55,800
Jello.

3080
01:31:58,580 --> 01:32:00,860
Everybody's thing is gonna be in jello.

3081
01:32:00,860 --> 01:32:01,520
Everybody's thing is gonna be in jello.

3082
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:06,800
I fucking hate my job.

3083
01:32:06,820 --> 01:32:07,800
I hate my job.

3084
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:08,340
I get paid.

3085
01:32:08,540 --> 01:32:10,580
I was the fucking supervisor.

3086
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:12,220
I had the perfect office.

3087
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:13,660
I had everything.

3088
01:32:14,220 --> 01:32:15,860
I had everything.

3089
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:21,760
I'm starting every goddamn fire.

3090
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:23,180
I'm starting every goddamn fire.

3091
01:32:23,180 --> 01:32:24,440
I don't work here anymore.

3092
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:26,260
So I don't even have cigarettes.

3093
01:32:27,260 --> 01:32:29,160
So I don't even have cigarettes.

3094
01:32:32,220 --> 01:32:34,860
I gonna steal this person's cigarette.

3095
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:40,500
I'm gonna make sure nobody's gonna have a good time.

3096
01:32:41,340 --> 01:32:42,920
Fuck this job.

3097
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:46,020
Okay.

3098
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:46,900
I'm smoking.

3099
01:32:48,140 --> 01:32:51,120
I'm gonna fucking hate this job so much.

3100
01:32:51,820 --> 01:32:53,840
All I do is work.

3101
01:32:54,060 --> 01:32:54,640
Thank you.

3102
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:56,040
Thank you.

3103
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:58,600
All I do is work.

3104
01:32:58,700 --> 01:32:59,140
I am a job.

3105
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:01,500
I can't get nothing out of it.

3106
01:33:03,460 --> 01:33:05,580
It doesn't matter.

3107
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:09,720
It doesn't fucking matter.

3108
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:13,040
I can't even take their fucking mouse.

3109
01:33:17,820 --> 01:33:20,960
How the fuck do I take his mouse?

3110
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:26,220
I can't even take the mouse!

3111
01:33:26,620 --> 01:33:27,500
Oh, I can.

3112
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:27,900
Okay.

3113
01:33:29,140 --> 01:33:30,200
Nobody deserves anything.

3114
01:33:30,660 --> 01:33:32,480
Nobody deserves...

3115
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:34,880
Nobody deserves to work anymore.

3116
01:33:35,740 --> 01:33:38,000
Nobody deserves to work.

3117
01:33:38,860 --> 01:33:39,780
Nobody...

3118
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:45,080
Nobody deserves to work anymore.

3119
01:33:45,940 --> 01:33:48,800
I refuse to let anybody work here.

3120
01:33:51,060 --> 01:33:53,300
You like my stash?

3121
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:55,720
I'm running a mouse black market.

3122
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:58,400
Have you not been fired already?

3123
01:33:58,460 --> 01:33:59,300
I'm a janitor.

3124
01:33:59,380 --> 01:34:00,500
I got demoted.

3125
01:34:00,520 --> 01:34:02,200
It doesn't matter how hard I work.

3126
01:34:02,340 --> 01:34:04,040
I didn't even start the fire.

3127
01:34:04,280 --> 01:34:05,620
You know who started it?

3128
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:08,400
It was fucking LM that started the fire.

3129
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:10,760
I was just next door.

3130
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:14,240
I was actually working.

3131
01:34:15,500 --> 01:34:16,500
Doesn't matter.

3132
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:19,280
He does find a way to ruin it for all sides, really.

3133
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:21,360
Doesn't matter how hard I work.

3134
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:22,360
It doesn't matter.

3135
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:23,340
You just get fired.

3136
01:34:23,340 --> 01:34:24,180
You go in.

3137
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:24,900
You clock in.

3138
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:25,620
You clock out.

3139
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:28,420
And then no matter how hard you work, you still get fired.

3140
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:29,740
What's the point in life anymore?

3141
01:34:30,260 --> 01:34:32,500
Weren't you one of the imposters anyway?

3142
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:35,080
Yeah, but I did an imposter.

3143
01:34:35,140 --> 01:34:36,580
I was just existing.

3144
01:34:36,580 --> 01:34:39,000
I was congratulating our wonderful manager.

3145
01:34:40,340 --> 01:34:41,780
Anyway, you guys need mouse?

3146
01:34:42,460 --> 01:34:44,280
I'm running a black market.

3147
01:34:45,060 --> 01:34:46,020
Yeah, well...

3148
01:34:46,820 --> 01:34:48,140
It comes with a price.

3149
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:50,160
Oh, okay.

3150
01:34:50,240 --> 01:34:51,260
It comes with a price.

3151
01:34:52,300 --> 01:34:53,420
Look, it's like...

3152
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:55,860
It's like, you know...

3153
01:34:55,860 --> 01:34:56,820
Like $50.

3154
01:34:58,560 --> 01:34:58,940
$50?

3155
01:34:59,140 --> 01:34:59,800
$50, yeah.

3156
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:01,980
Dude, the way we're getting paid here, you think I can afford that?

3157
01:35:02,060 --> 01:35:02,340
Oh, no.

3158
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:02,660
The meeting.

3159
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:08,500
The meeting!

3160
01:35:08,780 --> 01:35:10,820
Wanna make sure he doesn't get this mouse.

3161
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:14,620
Alright.

3162
01:35:21,740 --> 01:35:22,520
Oh, wait.

3163
01:35:23,460 --> 01:35:26,340
Okay, I'm gonna make sure nobody gets to work.

3164
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:31,200
I'm gonna make sure nobody will find this.

3165
01:35:32,380 --> 01:35:34,760
How would they expect it?

3166
01:35:36,100 --> 01:35:36,660
Alright.

3167
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:40,740
I'll go to the meeting.

3168
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:42,340
Where's the meeting room?

3169
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:45,000
Oh, there it is.

3170
01:35:46,140 --> 01:35:48,880
Hey, I mentioned you've done your own thing.

3171
01:35:48,940 --> 01:35:49,140
Yeah.

3172
01:35:49,140 --> 01:35:49,900
You can't just...

3173
01:35:49,900 --> 01:35:50,760
Ask me a question.

3174
01:35:50,820 --> 01:35:51,560
Ask me a question.

3175
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:52,940
Ask me a question an innocent person would know.

3176
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:53,520
Ask me.

3177
01:35:53,860 --> 01:35:54,340
Wait.

3178
01:35:54,720 --> 01:35:55,840
I'm already fired.

3179
01:35:56,040 --> 01:35:56,500
You can't...

3180
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:56,900
Please.

3181
01:35:56,940 --> 01:35:58,560
I already worked so hard.

3182
01:35:58,620 --> 01:35:59,560
What do you mean?

3183
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:00,680
I'm already...

3184
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:02,760
I'm already insanity.

3185
01:36:04,120 --> 01:36:05,740
I can't believe it.

3186
01:36:05,780 --> 01:36:06,260
You know what?

3187
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:09,440
I will ride out my imposter buddy.

3188
01:36:09,900 --> 01:36:11,420
You'll regret it, I tell you.

3189
01:36:11,940 --> 01:36:12,420
Whoa.

3190
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:13,280
What?

3191
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:14,020
What was you?

3192
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:15,300
I don't know.

3193
01:36:15,720 --> 01:36:17,980
Okay, I got two more tries.

3194
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:18,600
Two more tries.

3195
01:36:18,620 --> 01:36:19,040
I mean...

3196
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:19,560
I'm sorry.

3197
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:19,880
I'm sorry.

3198
01:36:19,880 --> 01:36:20,860
Oh, you're right.

3199
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:25,320
They won't know where the fire extinguisher is either.

3200
01:36:30,620 --> 01:36:31,900
They won't know.

3201
01:36:32,060 --> 01:36:32,380
The sun gets bullied.

3202
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:33,660
It's so sad.

3203
01:36:34,680 --> 01:36:36,060
They won't know.

3204
01:36:37,460 --> 01:36:40,040
Doki, I hope you're having a lovely day.

3205
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:42,000
And I'm so sorry that you got fired earlier.

3206
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,400
Then why didn't you defend me?

3207
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:45,560
Because...

3208
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:46,780
Why didn't you defend...

3209
01:36:46,780 --> 01:36:47,280
You know how...

3210
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:49,800
You know how hard I work every day.

3211
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:49,860
I'm sorry.

3212
01:36:49,860 --> 01:36:50,160
Every day.

3213
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:50,980
On the job.

3214
01:36:51,180 --> 01:36:51,640
Every other...

3215
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:54,300
One day, I decided to slack off.

3216
01:36:54,440 --> 01:36:55,900
And you didn't defend me.

3217
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:56,800
You were bad the other day, too.

3218
01:36:56,940 --> 01:36:58,100
When I was the manager.

3219
01:36:58,180 --> 01:36:58,520
No!

3220
01:36:58,520 --> 01:36:59,420
Let's be real.

3221
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:03,660
Don't you remember when we hung that picture on the bulletin board?

3222
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:04,620
We did.

3223
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:05,160
We did.

3224
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:08,120
That was the one day you were a very good worker.

3225
01:37:08,460 --> 01:37:08,880
And you didn't defend me.

3226
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:09,520
That's so true.

3227
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:10,980
Actually, we did have a moment.

3228
01:37:11,080 --> 01:37:12,100
We did have a moment.

3229
01:37:12,120 --> 01:37:12,260
Yeah!

3230
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:12,900
And I'm so sorry.

3231
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:15,880
And in the future, I will always defend you.

3232
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:16,320
Always?

3233
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:16,700
Always.

3234
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:17,840
Tomorrow's a new day.

3235
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:18,200
Always.

3236
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:18,500
Okay.

3237
01:37:18,540 --> 01:37:19,000
Tomorrow.

3238
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:19,600
Okay.

3239
01:37:19,660 --> 01:37:19,840
You said it.

3240
01:37:19,860 --> 01:37:20,060
Tomorrow's a new day.

3241
01:37:20,060 --> 01:37:20,740
You think I can be a...

3242
01:37:20,740 --> 01:37:23,940
You think I can get promoted back to a regular worker?

3243
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:25,480
Yes.

3244
01:37:25,580 --> 01:37:26,020
Yes.

3245
01:37:26,100 --> 01:37:26,740
I will...

3246
01:37:26,740 --> 01:37:28,040
I'll bring it up to them.

3247
01:37:28,260 --> 01:37:28,660
Oh, yeah.

3248
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:30,120
You'll talk to the manager, right?

3249
01:37:30,160 --> 01:37:31,340
To get my promotion back?

3250
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:31,720
You have my word.

3251
01:37:31,740 --> 01:37:32,100
Yes.

3252
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:32,720
Oh, thank you.

3253
01:37:32,740 --> 01:37:33,220
Thank you.

3254
01:37:33,240 --> 01:37:34,580
I really appreciate it.

3255
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:34,920
You're so welcome.

3256
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:35,020
Yes.

3257
01:37:35,020 --> 01:37:35,680
I have like...

3258
01:37:35,680 --> 01:37:38,720
I have like 10 dogs I need to take care of.

3259
01:37:38,720 --> 01:37:40,520
And Dejan, their salary's not it.

3260
01:37:40,860 --> 01:37:41,220
Wow.

3261
01:37:41,220 --> 01:37:41,260
Ah.

3262
01:37:47,450 --> 01:37:49,030
Well, like, you know...

3263
01:37:49,030 --> 01:37:51,090
You know, time's tough right now.

3264
01:37:51,230 --> 01:37:54,650
So, like, I'm trying to have like a mouse black market.

3265
01:37:54,650 --> 01:37:55,110
You know?

3266
01:37:55,130 --> 01:37:58,010
So, like, people can buy off extra mouse from me.

3267
01:37:58,070 --> 01:38:01,150
And so, for the extra money, you know, janitor work isn't...

3268
01:38:01,150 --> 01:38:03,030
It's like barely minimum wage, you know?

3269
01:38:04,230 --> 01:38:05,250
Like, I have...

3270
01:38:05,250 --> 01:38:06,710
Well, I really, really respect this grind.

3271
01:38:06,850 --> 01:38:07,530
I really do.

3272
01:38:07,670 --> 01:38:08,130
I really do.

3273
01:38:08,130 --> 01:38:09,750
Do you need a fire extinguisher?

3274
01:38:10,890 --> 01:38:11,690
I don't.

3275
01:38:11,690 --> 01:38:14,810
But as soon as I hear that someone does or a mouse, I'll bring it to you.

3276
01:38:14,810 --> 01:38:15,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3277
01:38:15,550 --> 01:38:16,690
You'll vouch for me, right?

3278
01:38:16,970 --> 01:38:17,510
I'll bring it to the bathroom.

3279
01:38:17,550 --> 01:38:17,910
All right.

3280
01:38:17,910 --> 01:38:18,170
All right.

3281
01:38:18,230 --> 01:38:18,550
Nice.

3282
01:38:18,650 --> 01:38:19,310
I got you.

3283
01:38:20,770 --> 01:38:21,990
That's so real.

3284
01:38:23,410 --> 01:38:24,050
That's so real.

3285
01:38:26,470 --> 01:38:27,950
This is too real.

3286
01:38:28,510 --> 01:38:32,710
I got to keep up my underground, my black market.

3287
01:38:35,930 --> 01:38:37,390
Janitors deserve more.

3288
01:38:37,470 --> 01:38:37,950
We do.

3289
01:38:39,110 --> 01:38:40,390
I was like, this is ridiculous.

3290
01:38:40,730 --> 01:38:41,130
You know?

3291
01:38:41,270 --> 01:38:41,670
It's like...

3292
01:38:41,670 --> 01:38:42,330
Oh, yeah.

3293
01:38:42,330 --> 01:38:43,430
Close your eyes.

3294
01:38:43,450 --> 01:38:43,870
Okay.

3295
01:38:44,970 --> 01:38:49,010
Yeah, we'll just work on your anti-airs then.

3296
01:38:49,350 --> 01:38:50,950
I fucking hate anti-air.

3297
01:38:50,990 --> 01:38:52,290
Thank you so much.

3298
01:38:52,290 --> 01:38:53,170
Thank you so much.

3299
01:38:53,170 --> 01:38:54,630
Why are we talking about this?

3300
01:38:54,630 --> 01:38:55,670
It's street fighting.

3301
01:38:59,030 --> 01:39:01,050
I just put out a fire.

3302
01:39:01,570 --> 01:39:01,990
Thank you so much.

3303
01:39:02,070 --> 01:39:02,410
All right.

3304
01:39:03,150 --> 01:39:03,670
Someone...

3305
01:39:03,670 --> 01:39:04,470
You know, maybe...

3306
01:39:04,470 --> 01:39:06,350
The servers went out at that last second, right?

3307
01:39:06,350 --> 01:39:08,930
The server went down and you distracted me from my post.

3308
01:39:09,210 --> 01:39:10,290
I could've got them.

3309
01:39:10,370 --> 01:39:12,370
I could've got them if you didn't doubt me.

3310
01:39:12,370 --> 01:39:15,470
I know you're innocent because you were talking to Lily when the server went down.

3311
01:39:15,670 --> 01:39:16,330
You could just...

3312
01:39:16,330 --> 01:39:18,990
There's only one slacker left, so it has to be...

3313
01:39:18,990 --> 01:39:19,690
For one second, I was distracted.

3314
01:39:19,890 --> 01:39:20,310
Unbelievable.

3315
01:39:20,830 --> 01:39:21,330
Unbelievable.

3316
01:39:21,550 --> 01:39:23,070
It has to be Dopey.

3317
01:39:23,070 --> 01:39:24,390
It has to be me.

3318
01:39:24,450 --> 01:39:24,610
I'm sorry.

3319
01:39:24,610 --> 01:39:26,010
I can't read Dopey's heart.

3320
01:39:26,030 --> 01:39:26,670
I literally called out...

3321
01:39:26,670 --> 01:39:28,110
I called out...

3322
01:39:28,110 --> 01:39:30,590
I put out a fire just then.

3323
01:39:30,710 --> 01:39:32,390
I've been doing so much.

3324
01:39:33,750 --> 01:39:36,250
Guys, let's not forget Shoto was in the vicinity.

3325
01:39:36,250 --> 01:39:36,750
You know what?

3326
01:39:36,770 --> 01:39:37,950
I'm gonna call out...

3327
01:39:37,950 --> 01:39:40,050
I'm gonna call out the slacker.

3328
01:39:40,930 --> 01:39:44,010
I will throw my slacker under the bus if I get promoted.

3329
01:39:44,230 --> 01:39:45,030
Let's remember that.

3330
01:39:45,330 --> 01:39:46,610
Let's remember that, guys.

3331
01:39:47,910 --> 01:39:48,390
Important.

3332
01:39:49,910 --> 01:39:50,390
Useful.

3333
01:39:51,090 --> 01:39:51,650
No, I was with Dopey.

3334
01:39:51,670 --> 01:39:52,310
I was with Dopey.

3335
01:39:52,310 --> 01:39:52,970
Wait, wait, wait.

3336
01:39:53,150 --> 01:39:54,590
If you promote me to assistant, I'll be promoted.

3337
01:39:54,590 --> 01:39:55,650
And give me my job back.

3338
01:39:55,830 --> 01:39:55,850
Oh.

3339
01:39:55,950 --> 01:39:56,690
So maybe it's Shoto.

3340
01:39:56,870 --> 01:39:57,250
Oh.

3341
01:39:57,310 --> 01:39:57,670
Oh.

3342
01:39:58,010 --> 01:39:58,650
Wait, what?

3343
01:39:59,090 --> 01:39:59,490
Janet?

3344
01:40:00,310 --> 01:40:00,710
Janet?

3345
01:40:00,850 --> 01:40:01,230
Janet?

3346
01:40:01,750 --> 01:40:02,150
You know what?

3347
01:40:02,150 --> 01:40:02,490
Foolish.

3348
01:40:02,810 --> 01:40:03,210
Wow.

3349
01:40:03,610 --> 01:40:04,910
I think it's foolish.

3350
01:40:05,330 --> 01:40:06,030
It's not me.

3351
01:40:06,290 --> 01:40:06,750
That happens.

3352
01:40:06,850 --> 01:40:07,430
Ray, Ray.

3353
01:40:07,430 --> 01:40:12,210
If you give me assistant, I will throw my slacker buddy under the bus.

3354
01:40:12,310 --> 01:40:13,530
It was Shoto.

3355
01:40:13,610 --> 01:40:14,570
He's getting defensive.

3356
01:40:15,230 --> 01:40:15,790
Let's see your test.

3357
01:40:15,790 --> 01:40:15,990
Let's see your test.

3358
01:40:15,990 --> 01:40:17,570
Shoto jellied my stapler.

3359
01:40:18,550 --> 01:40:19,490
What task do you have, Shoto?

3360
01:40:19,490 --> 01:40:20,190
Can you please open the door?

3361
01:40:20,730 --> 01:40:21,450
Open the door.

3362
01:40:21,550 --> 01:40:22,270
He's getting defensive.

3363
01:40:22,470 --> 01:40:22,870
No.

3364
01:40:22,870 --> 01:40:22,910
No.

3365
01:40:22,910 --> 01:40:23,630
No, it was me.

3366
01:40:23,670 --> 01:40:24,570
I jellied yours.

3367
01:40:25,570 --> 01:40:26,090
You jellied everybody's thing.

3368
01:40:26,090 --> 01:40:26,410
No, I.

3369
01:40:26,410 --> 01:40:27,250
Why are you laughing?

3370
01:40:27,650 --> 01:40:27,770
I mean it's okay.

3371
01:40:27,770 --> 01:40:30,110
No, it's because I jellied everybody's thing.

3372
01:40:30,410 --> 01:40:30,830
I jellied.

3373
01:40:32,170 --> 01:40:32,690
Wait.

3374
01:40:32,890 --> 01:40:33,690
Oh, wait.

3375
01:40:33,930 --> 01:40:34,890
I don't know.

3376
01:40:35,030 --> 01:40:36,590
I jellied like five people.

3377
01:40:36,730 --> 01:40:38,190
So I thought it was me.

3378
01:40:38,370 --> 01:40:41,270
I jellied five different people walking around.

3379
01:40:41,790 --> 01:40:42,610
What did you gain from this?

3380
01:40:43,090 --> 01:40:44,550
I am a janitor.

3381
01:40:44,690 --> 01:40:46,990
I have nothing else in my life.

3382
01:40:48,670 --> 01:40:51,430
I am barely getting paid the bare minimum.

3383
01:40:51,690 --> 01:40:53,430
You want to see all the people I jellied?

3384
01:40:53,490 --> 01:40:54,570
You want to see all the people I jellied?

3385
01:40:54,570 --> 01:40:57,050
I jellied like five different people.

3386
01:40:58,110 --> 01:40:58,970
Here's one.

3387
01:40:59,070 --> 01:41:00,810
I jellied Foolish.

3388
01:41:00,830 --> 01:41:04,010
I jellied a Zicuno.

3389
01:41:05,650 --> 01:41:07,990
So why do we think it's not Zicuno?

3390
01:41:09,230 --> 01:41:09,790
Alright,

3391
01:41:13,030 --> 01:41:13,650
let's see.

3392
01:41:19,590 --> 01:41:20,430
Don't do it.

3393
01:41:20,450 --> 01:41:21,170
It's not worth it.

3394
01:41:21,270 --> 01:41:23,370
Just don't do the bare minimum.

3395
01:41:23,370 --> 01:41:24,710
It's never worth it.

3396
01:41:25,610 --> 01:41:28,210
Where's the server room?

3397
01:41:28,290 --> 01:41:29,530
What if I just turn off the...

3398
01:41:29,530 --> 01:41:31,530
Can I actually turn off the server as a...

3399
01:41:31,530 --> 01:41:32,450
Oh, I can.

3400
01:41:35,890 --> 01:41:38,410
I wanna watch that full video, though, after this.

3401
01:41:40,310 --> 01:41:43,070
I love how he is unmuted.

3402
01:41:45,370 --> 01:41:45,810
Okay.

3403
01:41:46,570 --> 01:41:47,010
Alright.

3404
01:41:47,090 --> 01:41:50,710
She knew about my plan to camp the server room, and in one second, I'm not camping it.

3405
01:41:50,730 --> 01:41:52,330
But I was with...

3406
01:41:52,330 --> 01:41:53,250
Who could do that?

3407
01:41:53,370 --> 01:41:55,610
I just have a chance for it to pop up on their own computer.

3408
01:41:55,770 --> 01:41:58,590
By the way, my favorite thing...

3409
01:41:58,590 --> 01:42:00,330
Ellum's having his own conversation.

3410
01:42:00,350 --> 01:42:04,130
My favorite thing this entire day was literally that one little bit of dialogue with Foolish.

3411
01:42:04,130 --> 01:42:04,270
Oh, no.

3412
01:42:04,370 --> 01:42:04,930
Not Ellum.

3413
01:42:05,230 --> 01:42:07,270
Thanks for the information.

3414
01:42:07,630 --> 01:42:08,610
Oh, shit.

3415
01:42:09,190 --> 01:42:11,410
I thought it was Ellum, but it was Blau.

3416
01:42:11,650 --> 01:42:13,750
Oh, I can't sabotage the server.

3417
01:42:16,490 --> 01:42:17,470
That's fucking right.

3418
01:42:17,510 --> 01:42:19,230
You're never gonna get your tasks done.

3419
01:42:19,810 --> 01:42:20,910
That's fucking right.

3420
01:42:21,010 --> 01:42:23,050
We'll never have our quarterly report.

3421
01:42:23,690 --> 01:42:24,370
That's right.

3422
01:42:24,790 --> 01:42:27,350
We'll never have the quarterly report.

3423
01:42:31,030 --> 01:42:33,110
Wait, why are you drinking, Tina?

3424
01:42:33,310 --> 01:42:34,290
What's going on?

3425
01:42:34,590 --> 01:42:35,610
I got a drink with the garbage.

3426
01:42:36,110 --> 01:42:37,050
Where are you going?

3427
01:42:37,190 --> 01:42:38,050
That's my job.

3428
01:42:38,130 --> 01:42:39,850
Are you gonna take my job too, Tina?

3429
01:42:40,170 --> 01:42:41,950
Are you trying to take my... Everybody got fired.

3430
01:42:42,030 --> 01:42:43,110
Are you trying to take my job?

3431
01:42:43,170 --> 01:42:44,430
You're not doing your job, Tina.

3432
01:42:44,670 --> 01:42:45,650
You're not doing your job.

3433
01:42:45,650 --> 01:42:45,690
I am!

3434
01:42:45,690 --> 01:42:46,170
I am!

3435
01:42:46,490 --> 01:42:47,610
There's so much trash!

3436
01:42:48,910 --> 01:42:49,870
Holy motherfucker!

3437
01:42:50,770 --> 01:42:52,270
I'M NOT DOING MY JOB!

3438
01:42:52,290 --> 01:42:53,050
I'M NOT DOING MY JOB!

3439
01:42:53,050 --> 01:42:53,450
I'M NOT DOING MY JOB RIGHT NOW!

3440
01:42:53,930 --> 01:42:54,250
I'm getting blamed!

3441
01:42:55,070 --> 01:42:57,330
Oh god, there's a whole meeting happening right now.

3442
01:42:57,330 --> 01:42:57,730
No.

3443
01:42:59,570 --> 01:43:00,130
Oh.

3444
01:43:00,830 --> 01:43:01,390
Oh.

3445
01:43:02,870 --> 01:43:03,510
So hectic.

3446
01:43:03,510 --> 01:43:04,290
So hectic.

3447
01:43:04,290 --> 01:43:05,090
Wait, can I...

3448
01:43:05,090 --> 01:43:05,850
What?

3449
01:43:07,510 --> 01:43:09,390
I told you I crunched the numbers.

3450
01:43:09,750 --> 01:43:11,570
What do you mean you crunched the numbers?

3451
01:43:11,570 --> 01:43:12,350
What numbers?

3452
01:43:12,690 --> 01:43:13,330
It was...

3453
01:43:13,330 --> 01:43:15,410
I said it was down to her...

3454
01:43:15,410 --> 01:43:18,310
I didn't... I didn't even start the fire!

3455
01:43:18,310 --> 01:43:18,530
I was here!

3456
01:43:18,550 --> 01:43:19,990
Ella more showed up, dude!

3457
01:43:20,070 --> 01:43:21,770
And I was like just next to it!

3458
01:43:22,710 --> 01:43:23,570
Oh, that's crazy.

3459
01:43:25,090 --> 01:43:26,910
I didn't even start the fire.

3460
01:43:26,930 --> 01:43:27,130
I didn't even start the fire.

3461
01:43:27,330 --> 01:43:28,650
I was like, ooh, what is this button to?

3462
01:43:30,170 --> 01:43:31,590
I guess she found out, I guess.

3463
01:43:32,350 --> 01:43:33,710
This is my first time being a slacker.

3464
01:43:33,710 --> 01:43:38,330
Yeah, apparently... Yeah, when you're a slacker, you have a chance for the virus to be on your PC automatically.

3465
01:43:38,730 --> 01:43:40,850
So it does suss them out a little bit.

3466
01:43:40,950 --> 01:43:41,170
Yeah.

3467
01:43:41,810 --> 01:43:47,910
If you're a slacker, you need to get that task where you can spread the virus so you look less sussed.

3468
01:43:47,910 --> 01:43:48,290
Pretty much.

3469
01:43:48,290 --> 01:43:49,070
That's pretty dumb.

3470
01:43:51,210 --> 01:43:52,350
I didn't know that.

3471
01:43:52,690 --> 01:43:53,290
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3472
01:43:53,290 --> 01:43:54,110
It's a little suss.

3473
01:43:54,510 --> 01:43:58,370
Oh, but that means you can plant the virus thing on other people's computer.

3474
01:43:58,430 --> 01:44:01,610
But if you get caught with the floppy disk, you're extra, extra sussed.

3475
01:44:01,850 --> 01:44:03,370
How is Ella always a slacker?

3476
01:44:03,870 --> 01:44:05,510
Yeah, he got it three times in a row.

3477
01:44:05,890 --> 01:44:08,310
I just kind of... I don't want to be the slacker.

3478
01:44:08,730 --> 01:44:09,690
I don't want to be the slacker.

3479
01:44:10,350 --> 01:44:11,930
I don't want to be the slacker either, honestly.

3480
01:44:12,130 --> 01:44:15,850
The thing is, anyone asks you what the task is for a normal specialist, I can't name you one.

3481
01:44:15,970 --> 01:44:17,070
I don't even know one.

3482
01:44:19,310 --> 01:44:22,050
Thanks for being a sub in my chat, Lily Peachy.

3483
01:44:22,070 --> 01:44:22,410
Appreciate that a lot.

3484
01:44:22,410 --> 01:44:22,970
Who hasn't been manager yet?

3485
01:44:23,130 --> 01:44:24,410
Maybe we make the manager.

3486
01:44:24,690 --> 01:44:25,290
Yeah, yeah.

3487
01:44:27,150 --> 01:44:28,230
Foolish, have you been manager?

3488
01:44:28,490 --> 01:44:29,450
I was our very first one.

3489
01:44:29,550 --> 01:44:30,270
Lily, Lily.

3490
01:44:30,990 --> 01:44:33,630
I believe in you.

3491
01:44:33,930 --> 01:44:35,550
Okay, let's give Lily manager.

3492
01:44:35,690 --> 01:44:37,370
And then we're missing one person.

3493
01:44:37,430 --> 01:44:37,830
Oh, perfect, perfect.

3494
01:44:38,930 --> 01:44:40,330
I'm customizing my character.

3495
01:44:40,510 --> 01:44:41,150
Hope you're ready, Lily.

3496
01:44:41,330 --> 01:44:42,310
It's a lot of responsibility.

3497
01:44:42,590 --> 01:44:43,550
It is a lot of responsibility.

3498
01:44:44,610 --> 01:44:45,890
We're really counting on you.

3499
01:44:46,410 --> 01:44:46,870
Wait, I was...

3500
01:44:46,870 --> 01:44:47,010
Lily!

3501
01:44:48,110 --> 01:44:49,810
We really are counting on you.

3502
01:44:49,830 --> 01:44:53,810
The company will go bankrupt if you don't do a good job, Lily.

3503
01:44:54,370 --> 01:44:54,390
Oh, no.

3504
01:44:54,570 --> 01:44:55,890
I would love to be your assistant.

3505
01:45:01,050 --> 01:45:02,270
Oh, my God.

3506
01:45:02,550 --> 01:45:03,190
Slacker again?

3507
01:45:03,410 --> 01:45:04,770
Oh, I'm no slacker, baby.

3508
01:45:04,890 --> 01:45:05,210
Let's go.

3509
01:45:05,450 --> 01:45:06,850
I mean, we can just bug you out, doesn't it?

3510
01:45:06,850 --> 01:45:08,990
Hey, I got my job back!

3511
01:45:10,350 --> 01:45:11,750
Janet, you did it!

3512
01:45:11,790 --> 01:45:13,530
I got my job back, Janet!

3513
01:45:14,290 --> 01:45:15,290
Wait, what's that?

3514
01:45:15,350 --> 01:45:15,870
What's wrong?

3515
01:45:15,890 --> 01:45:16,810
I didn't!

3516
01:45:16,810 --> 01:45:17,410
I got my job back!

3517
01:45:17,470 --> 01:45:18,510
You vouched for me, right?

3518
01:45:19,290 --> 01:45:20,770
Yes, I vouched for you!

3519
01:45:20,770 --> 01:45:20,970
I vouched for you!

3520
01:45:20,970 --> 01:45:21,390
Oh, my God.

3521
01:45:21,470 --> 01:45:21,990
I knew it.

3522
01:45:22,110 --> 01:45:24,330
I knew you were in it for the long run.

3523
01:45:24,410 --> 01:45:25,210
Thank you so much.

3524
01:45:25,350 --> 01:45:26,370
I really appreciate it.

3525
01:45:26,670 --> 01:45:27,190
And I got you, too.

3526
01:45:27,190 --> 01:45:28,150
I got you, too.

3527
01:45:28,330 --> 01:45:29,190
What are you doing?

3528
01:45:29,210 --> 01:45:30,230
Tell me what you're doing right now.

3529
01:45:30,270 --> 01:45:31,430
Oh, she got my job back!

3530
01:45:31,470 --> 01:45:32,030
I got promoted!

3531
01:45:32,570 --> 01:45:34,230
Because she's my co-worker.

3532
01:45:34,330 --> 01:45:35,830
Yeah, I'm not Janet anymore.

3533
01:45:37,150 --> 01:45:37,550
What?

3534
01:45:37,670 --> 01:45:39,370
Yeah, and I'm gonna go do another job now.

3535
01:45:39,370 --> 01:45:40,390
You're just really quiet.

3536
01:45:41,150 --> 01:45:41,550
Okay.

3537
01:45:42,490 --> 01:45:44,510
All right, I gotta pick up the trash.

3538
01:45:44,730 --> 01:45:46,390
Who's... this is my... I got...

3539
01:45:46,390 --> 01:45:48,970
Can anybody throw some trash on the floor?

3540
01:45:52,150 --> 01:45:53,430
Wow, that's unexpected.

3541
01:45:54,190 --> 01:45:54,210
All right.

3542
01:45:54,210 --> 01:45:55,470
I'm gonna... guys, I'm gonna...

3543
01:45:55,470 --> 01:45:55,850
I won't tell anyone.

3544
01:45:57,210 --> 01:45:57,910
Well, like...

3545
01:45:57,910 --> 01:45:58,170
Wait.

3546
01:45:58,270 --> 01:45:59,030
First of all...

3547
01:45:59,490 --> 01:46:01,290
First of all, I'm a neutral.

3548
01:46:01,710 --> 01:46:01,990
Yeah?

3549
01:46:01,990 --> 01:46:06,230
And second of all, why is even buying a banana, like, considered a strong thing?

3550
01:46:06,230 --> 01:46:06,270
Yeah.

3551
01:46:06,450 --> 01:46:08,450
Like, why would there be a vending machine?

3552
01:46:08,450 --> 01:46:08,670
Because she's not working.

3553
01:46:08,930 --> 01:46:10,350
Why would there be a vending machine?

3554
01:46:10,390 --> 01:46:11,810
Yeah, but it's a quick snap.

3555
01:46:11,850 --> 01:46:12,890
It's my break time.

3556
01:46:13,250 --> 01:46:14,590
Yeah, but we're supposed to work.

3557
01:46:14,630 --> 01:46:15,310
We can't have any break.

3558
01:46:15,310 --> 01:46:16,090
It's my break hours.

3559
01:46:16,190 --> 01:46:18,430
We each have five-minute break time every day.

3560
01:46:18,810 --> 01:46:20,590
I'm taking my five minutes.

3561
01:46:20,750 --> 01:46:21,570
I got five kids.

3562
01:46:21,570 --> 01:46:22,830
She has diabetes.

3563
01:46:23,150 --> 01:46:24,910
She needs the extra...

3564
01:46:24,910 --> 01:46:25,230
I don't have time for breaks.

3565
01:46:25,550 --> 01:46:27,350
She has diabetes.

3566
01:46:27,350 --> 01:46:29,070
She needs to get her sugar levels up.

3567
01:46:30,090 --> 01:46:30,530
Exactly.

3568
01:46:30,750 --> 01:46:31,070
Is that true?

3569
01:46:32,050 --> 01:46:32,490
Yes.

3570
01:46:33,030 --> 01:46:34,550
I have it.

3571
01:46:35,550 --> 01:46:37,090
She has type 2 diabetes.

3572
01:46:37,870 --> 01:46:38,310
Which side?

3573
01:46:38,310 --> 01:46:38,830
Which side do you have?

3574
01:46:38,970 --> 01:46:39,690
Type 2.

3575
01:46:39,710 --> 01:46:40,570
What dogey said?

3576
01:46:40,670 --> 01:46:41,450
Yeah, type 2.

3577
01:46:41,490 --> 01:46:43,570
Are you discriminating against type 2 diabetes?

3578
01:46:43,570 --> 01:46:44,590
What's the difference between one and two?

3579
01:46:44,650 --> 01:46:44,910
What do you mean?

3580
01:46:44,910 --> 01:46:45,190
What's the difference?

3581
01:46:45,190 --> 01:46:46,970
What do you mean, what's the difference?

3582
01:46:47,050 --> 01:46:48,110
You can't just question that!

3583
01:46:48,130 --> 01:46:49,030
That's her medical history!

3584
01:46:49,570 --> 01:46:49,930
What's the difference?

3585
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:50,510
What's the difference?

3586
01:46:50,530 --> 01:46:51,570
Diabetes, that's messed up!

3587
01:46:51,950 --> 01:46:53,070
That's messed up!

3588
01:46:53,270 --> 01:46:53,690
Ooh, cake!

3589
01:46:56,350 --> 01:47:00,590
You can't question somebody's diabetes medical history!

3590
01:47:00,830 --> 01:47:03,290
Yeah, that's insensitive of you!

3591
01:47:03,310 --> 01:47:05,870
Yeah, clearly you missed out on sensitivity training.

3592
01:47:06,270 --> 01:47:06,450
I apologize.

3593
01:47:06,830 --> 01:47:07,150
You know what?

3594
01:47:07,210 --> 01:47:07,550
I apologize.

3595
01:47:07,750 --> 01:47:08,170
That's my bad.

3596
01:47:09,250 --> 01:47:11,510
You know, I was just a little mad, really.

3597
01:47:11,650 --> 01:47:12,490
I'm just stressed, really.

3598
01:47:12,670 --> 01:47:13,350
No, really?

3599
01:47:13,470 --> 01:47:14,250
What's going on?

3600
01:47:14,770 --> 01:47:16,470
Wait, let me go grab a beer.

3601
01:47:16,550 --> 01:47:17,790
I need to take a sip.

3602
01:47:18,310 --> 01:47:19,590
What is going on?

3603
01:47:19,670 --> 01:47:20,290
I can't move!

3604
01:47:22,150 --> 01:47:22,590
No?

3605
01:47:23,750 --> 01:47:24,750
I'm a working man!

3606
01:47:24,990 --> 01:47:28,850
Yeah, so what's been stressing you out, Dakin?

3607
01:47:29,430 --> 01:47:34,090
Honestly, it's just the wife and the kids really like...

3608
01:47:34,090 --> 01:47:34,570
Yeah?

3609
01:47:34,730 --> 01:47:39,690
I got so much like... they're just really expecting me to come home and be a dad, really.

3610
01:47:39,830 --> 01:47:40,570
And I can't, you know?

3611
01:47:40,630 --> 01:47:42,090
Yeah, because you're working a 9 to 5.

3612
01:47:42,570 --> 01:47:43,990
It's a hard job.

3613
01:47:44,110 --> 01:47:44,230
Exactly.

3614
01:47:44,250 --> 01:47:45,610
Oh, I don't feel so good.

3615
01:47:45,690 --> 01:47:46,130
My head is...

3616
01:47:46,130 --> 01:47:46,890
Oh, don't worry.

3617
01:47:46,970 --> 01:47:48,010
You drank on the job.

3618
01:47:48,010 --> 01:47:48,210
See?

3619
01:47:48,450 --> 01:47:48,930
Don't worry.

3620
01:47:49,010 --> 01:47:49,490
We all get one.

3621
01:47:49,570 --> 01:47:50,810
We all get one 5-minute break.

3622
01:47:51,750 --> 01:47:53,070
Yeah, we should go to the meeting.

3623
01:47:53,450 --> 01:47:53,970
Yeah, yeah.

3624
01:47:53,990 --> 01:47:56,650
We can file a complaint about the long hours.

3625
01:47:58,290 --> 01:47:58,950
Yeah, yeah.

3626
01:47:58,990 --> 01:48:00,850
Just follow my lead.

3627
01:48:06,920 --> 01:48:07,320
Manager?

3628
01:48:09,260 --> 01:48:10,460
Manager, I have a question.

3629
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:12,220
Yeah, what's up?

3630
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:14,620
Can we have shorter work hours?

3631
01:48:15,780 --> 01:48:17,680
We've been doing a lot of overtime lately.

3632
01:48:18,600 --> 01:48:19,480
I disagree.

3633
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:21,060
I think we can double our efforts.

3634
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:24,320
No, you can't.

3635
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:24,940
You're being a loser.

3636
01:48:24,940 --> 01:48:25,840
Can we kick this guy out?

3637
01:48:25,980 --> 01:48:27,260
I'm surprised you're still alive.

3638
01:48:28,860 --> 01:48:32,160
I'm always suspicious of alum, but...

3639
01:48:32,160 --> 01:48:33,860
I'm always suspicious of brother Noah.

3640
01:48:33,940 --> 01:48:35,340
He's always a strange one.

3641
01:48:35,560 --> 01:48:36,440
Yeah, right.

3642
01:48:36,920 --> 01:48:37,680
Yeah, right.

3643
01:48:37,860 --> 01:48:39,400
I swear you smack me one more time.

3644
01:48:39,400 --> 01:48:39,920
Miss Manager?

3645
01:48:41,220 --> 01:48:41,740
Yeah?

3646
01:48:42,180 --> 01:48:43,380
Can we start a union?

3647
01:48:44,100 --> 01:48:45,260
Yeah, do you see that?

3648
01:48:45,540 --> 01:48:45,940
No.

3649
01:48:45,940 --> 01:48:47,420
This is a non-union workplace.

3650
01:48:47,420 --> 01:48:49,440
This is a non-union workplace?

3651
01:48:51,200 --> 01:48:51,540
Huh?

3652
01:48:51,680 --> 01:48:51,880
What?

3653
01:48:52,040 --> 01:48:52,800
Are you talking to me?

3654
01:48:53,200 --> 01:48:53,600
Oh, man.

3655
01:48:53,860 --> 01:48:54,200
Okay.

3656
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:56,340
I'm trying to listen, honestly.

3657
01:48:56,620 --> 01:48:58,320
I'm trying to listen, so I don't know.

3658
01:48:59,380 --> 01:48:59,940
I don't know what you're talking about.

3659
01:48:59,940 --> 01:49:00,420
I'm trying to listen.

3660
01:49:01,060 --> 01:49:01,960
Yeah, sure, man.

3661
01:49:05,200 --> 01:49:06,640
I don't think they can hear me.

3662
01:49:08,160 --> 01:49:09,860
Yeah, we can hear you.

3663
01:49:10,040 --> 01:49:10,520
They can hear me?

3664
01:49:10,540 --> 01:49:10,700
Okay.

3665
01:49:11,240 --> 01:49:12,580
Hey, do you guys want to start a union?

3666
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:15,000
A union?

3667
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:15,500
Yeah.

3668
01:49:15,800 --> 01:49:18,660
Lily said this is a non-union workplace, and that's not fair.

3669
01:49:18,920 --> 01:49:23,300
Like, we need reasonable wages and reasonable work hours.

3670
01:49:23,620 --> 01:49:27,640
Dak in here was telling me how he can't even see his wife and kids anymore because of the hours.

3671
01:49:28,760 --> 01:49:30,060
Yeah, we should start a union.

3672
01:49:32,160 --> 01:49:35,500
What if the entire company revolts against us?

3673
01:49:35,820 --> 01:49:36,340
Don't wait!

3674
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:38,040
People don't want extra money?

3675
01:49:38,680 --> 01:49:40,740
What if we get enough people to...

3676
01:49:40,740 --> 01:49:41,640
Yeah, yeah.

3677
01:49:41,660 --> 01:49:44,200
Let's make a petition for a union.

3678
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:45,680
And have everybody sign in.

3679
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:47,840
And then we vote Lily off.

3680
01:49:48,380 --> 01:49:48,740
Yeah.

3681
01:49:49,040 --> 01:49:50,280
Vote Lily out of position.

3682
01:49:50,600 --> 01:49:53,760
And then we'll have a union leader on position.

3683
01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:57,960
I mean, I feel like I really speak for the people.

3684
01:49:58,060 --> 01:50:00,360
Yeah, I think Dak in would be a great union leader.

3685
01:50:01,340 --> 01:50:02,660
But we need more people, though.

3686
01:50:02,740 --> 01:50:03,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3687
01:50:03,200 --> 01:50:04,380
I'll write the documents.

3688
01:50:05,340 --> 01:50:06,460
Blah, would you like to join the union?

3689
01:50:06,500 --> 01:50:07,320
Yeah, you want to join the union?

3690
01:50:07,820 --> 01:50:10,560
Lily said we're not allowed to have a union, and that's ununion-like.

3691
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:11,280
Hey, Jenna, would you like to join?

3692
01:50:11,340 --> 01:50:12,280
You want to join our union?

3693
01:50:12,680 --> 01:50:14,060
I'm down to join a union, yeah.

3694
01:50:14,060 --> 01:50:14,860
I'm all for you.

3695
01:50:14,860 --> 01:50:15,820
We want to get a new manager.

3696
01:50:15,820 --> 01:50:16,360
Yeah, yeah.

3697
01:50:16,380 --> 01:50:18,860
I'm going to write a petition right now, and we all sign in.

3698
01:50:19,400 --> 01:50:21,240
We need licenses and unites us together.

3699
01:50:23,100 --> 01:50:24,440
We were just talking about work.

3700
01:50:24,540 --> 01:50:25,520
We were just talking about work.

3701
01:50:25,660 --> 01:50:26,600
Wait, wait, wait.

3702
01:50:26,600 --> 01:50:28,060
Oh, of course, we have a bootlicker here.

3703
01:50:28,140 --> 01:50:28,640
Get out of here.

3704
01:50:28,640 --> 01:50:29,200
Oh, we got them.

3705
01:50:29,480 --> 01:50:30,280
Oh, dang.

3706
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:32,860
What are we doing?

3707
01:50:32,920 --> 01:50:33,500
Not being bailed?

3708
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:37,140
Dale and Dawson union.

3709
01:50:38,680 --> 01:50:41,920
We demand a union.

3710
01:50:42,700 --> 01:50:43,140
Oh.

3711
01:50:43,140 --> 01:50:46,060
For fair wages and hours.

3712
01:50:46,480 --> 01:50:55,540
Dakin is our union, union leader, and he speaks for us, and it was his idea.

3713
01:50:55,980 --> 01:50:56,680
Can you sign this?

3714
01:51:00,900 --> 01:51:08,060
Down with the tyrannical leader, manager Lily.

3715
01:51:09,100 --> 01:51:09,780
There you go.

3716
01:51:09,860 --> 01:51:10,980
Put the floppy disk there.

3717
01:51:13,140 --> 01:51:13,580
Innocent.

3718
01:51:14,220 --> 01:51:15,460
Dumb man.

3719
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:16,680
All right.

3720
01:51:17,020 --> 01:51:18,520
There's like two little domes in front of me.

3721
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:19,300
Like five.

3722
01:51:19,720 --> 01:51:22,840
It was me on this pooping on company time.

3723
01:51:23,060 --> 01:51:23,780
Get back to work.

3724
01:51:25,080 --> 01:51:28,080
Okay, somebody else will find this paper.

3725
01:51:28,240 --> 01:51:30,200
Wait, somebody lock the door.

3726
01:51:30,840 --> 01:51:31,160
Hello?

3727
01:51:32,520 --> 01:51:33,160
Hello?

3728
01:51:36,100 --> 01:51:37,800
I'm saying lock the door.

3729
01:51:42,940 --> 01:51:44,280
I think it's the meeting?

3730
01:51:44,680 --> 01:51:46,160
You might have to fire someone, Lily.

3731
01:51:46,300 --> 01:51:47,180
You might have to fire someone.

3732
01:51:47,180 --> 01:51:48,020
Oh, you have to fire Lily.

3733
01:51:48,840 --> 01:51:50,280
You're fucking lying.

3734
01:51:50,620 --> 01:51:51,920
Lily, you're a weirdo.

3735
01:51:52,260 --> 01:51:53,060
All right, let's go.

3736
01:51:54,680 --> 01:51:55,580
Lily, meeting.

3737
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:58,820
Lily, LM is like in the...

3738
01:51:59,260 --> 01:52:01,060
LM is stuck in the copier room.

3739
01:52:01,100 --> 01:52:02,040
We keep blocking the doors.

3740
01:52:02,160 --> 01:52:03,500
Dude, it's gotta be someone.

3741
01:52:03,980 --> 01:52:04,340
Sakuna has the keys.

3742
01:52:04,340 --> 01:52:04,980
Sakuna has the keys.

3743
01:52:04,980 --> 01:52:05,280
You can't...

3744
01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:07,360
You have to be an experienced veteran.

3745
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:08,660
I have the keys.

3746
01:52:08,780 --> 01:52:09,220
I agree.

3747
01:52:13,820 --> 01:52:16,900
There's like two people locked in the copier room, Lily.

3748
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:19,040
Something's sniffing about you.

3749
01:52:19,080 --> 01:52:19,880
I can't tell what it is.

3750
01:52:19,900 --> 01:52:21,160
I'm a little suspicious of Shoto.

3751
01:52:21,800 --> 01:52:22,940
I grew out my hair.

3752
01:52:23,140 --> 01:52:23,520
He's not here.

3753
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:32,060
Good job, Lily.

3754
01:52:32,860 --> 01:52:33,740
Good job.

3755
01:52:35,280 --> 01:52:36,340
Good job, Lily.

3756
01:52:37,020 --> 01:52:37,820
Good job.

3757
01:52:42,140 --> 01:52:44,640
So people are stuck in the copier room?

3758
01:52:48,140 --> 01:52:51,380
Miss Manager, LM is stuck in the copier room.

3759
01:52:51,460 --> 01:52:52,600
Maybe we should keep him there.

3760
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:53,740
Everybody do...

3761
01:52:54,150 --> 01:52:55,280
No, keep him there.

3762
01:52:55,320 --> 01:52:55,800
Yeah, yeah.

3763
01:52:55,820 --> 01:52:56,620
We should keep him there.

3764
01:52:56,660 --> 01:52:57,740
No union.

3765
01:52:57,960 --> 01:52:58,560
No union.

3766
01:52:58,760 --> 01:52:59,740
I didn't say anything.

3767
01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:00,720
I didn't say anything.

3768
01:53:01,220 --> 01:53:01,560
It's our first day.

3769
01:53:01,740 --> 01:53:03,020
It's our first day on the job.

3770
01:53:04,140 --> 01:53:04,600
Okay.

3771
01:53:04,600 --> 01:53:04,940
Okay.

3772
01:53:05,180 --> 01:53:05,620
Sit.

3773
01:53:05,720 --> 01:53:05,780
Sit.

3774
01:53:05,780 --> 01:53:06,040
Sit.

3775
01:53:06,120 --> 01:53:06,600
Oh, God.

3776
01:53:08,520 --> 01:53:09,760
Who started the fire?

3777
01:53:10,120 --> 01:53:11,520
Mi-Jong, did you do that?

3778
01:53:12,160 --> 01:53:12,600
Huh?

3779
01:53:12,840 --> 01:53:13,280
Yes!

3780
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:14,280
I'm sure it started a fire.

3781
01:53:14,440 --> 01:53:14,880
Yeah.

3782
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:16,200
Who decided that?

3783
01:53:16,380 --> 01:53:17,340
It was Dakin.

3784
01:53:17,360 --> 01:53:17,800
Yeah.

3785
01:53:18,740 --> 01:53:21,420
Yeah, Dakin started the fire.

3786
01:53:21,540 --> 01:53:23,260
Yeah, Dakin started the fire.

3787
01:53:24,420 --> 01:53:25,260
Hey, wait, wait.

3788
01:53:26,320 --> 01:53:27,020
There's a fire.

3789
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:27,360
There's a fire.

3790
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:27,940
There's a fire.

3791
01:53:27,940 --> 01:53:27,960
There's a fire.

3792
01:53:28,180 --> 01:53:29,580
Who is locking the doors?

3793
01:53:31,340 --> 01:53:32,380
What's that ringing?

3794
01:53:32,520 --> 01:53:32,960
How am I getting this?

3795
01:53:32,980 --> 01:53:33,400
Guys, God forbid.

3796
01:53:33,400 --> 01:53:34,180
Guys, God forbid.

3797
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:34,580
Guys, God forbid.

3798
01:53:34,580 --> 01:53:39,480
Who ever voted Shoto, by the way, you're safe for that.

3799
01:53:39,680 --> 01:53:44,160
I was saying Simmons and then Shoto and then you go vote it out.

3800
01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:46,220
Why was he?

3801
01:53:47,100 --> 01:53:49,600
You got a sticky note on your back.

3802
01:53:49,680 --> 01:53:51,100
Yeah, you got a sticky note.

3803
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:54,660
It says loser.

3804
01:53:55,340 --> 01:53:56,420
It said loser.

3805
01:53:58,820 --> 01:54:01,680
Yeah, it said loser on the back.

3806
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:03,360
Ellum?

3807
01:54:04,180 --> 01:54:05,960
I would never do such a thing.

3808
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:07,540
Wait, is there something behind my back?

3809
01:54:08,280 --> 01:54:09,180
Yeah, it says loser.

3810
01:54:10,360 --> 01:54:11,380
Wait, I'm not a loser.

3811
01:54:11,380 --> 01:54:12,500
Yeah, yeah, loser.

3812
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:15,340
Are you calling the manager the loser?

3813
01:54:16,120 --> 01:54:17,220
No, I said I'm not.

3814
01:54:17,960 --> 01:54:18,960
No, you're the best, honestly.

3815
01:54:19,240 --> 01:54:20,140
Oh, thank you, I know.

3816
01:54:23,940 --> 01:54:25,400
Timmy, you were making fun of her name.

3817
01:54:25,520 --> 01:54:25,800
Yeah.

3818
01:54:26,740 --> 01:54:27,820
I don't even know what that means.

3819
01:54:29,620 --> 01:54:30,160
That's a lie.

3820
01:54:32,740 --> 01:54:33,700
I'll remember that.

3821
01:54:34,140 --> 01:54:34,720
I'll remember.

3822
01:54:34,820 --> 01:54:35,600
No, no, that's fine.

3823
01:54:35,660 --> 01:54:36,040
That's fine.

3824
01:54:36,080 --> 01:54:36,980
No, no, that's fine.

3825
01:54:37,320 --> 01:54:38,140
No, no, no, no.

3826
01:54:38,220 --> 01:54:39,200
Wait, you have something on your back.

3827
01:54:39,340 --> 01:54:40,980
No, no, no, there's nothing on my back.

3828
01:54:42,020 --> 01:54:42,960
No, what are you doing?

3829
01:54:43,220 --> 01:54:44,020
Personal space!

3830
01:54:44,180 --> 01:54:44,660
Personal space!

3831
01:54:45,340 --> 01:54:45,980
Personal space!

3832
01:54:46,160 --> 01:54:47,200
I am the manager.

3833
01:54:47,300 --> 01:54:48,840
We do not want another sensitivity training.

3834
01:54:49,180 --> 01:54:49,840
Wait, what does it say?

3835
01:54:51,500 --> 01:54:52,700
Is that what it says?

3836
01:54:54,240 --> 01:54:56,740
Are you putting sticky notes on people?

3837
01:54:58,320 --> 01:54:59,300
Wait, what does it say?

3838
01:54:59,540 --> 01:55:00,280
What does it say?

3839
01:55:00,280 --> 01:55:01,740
100% slacker?

3840
01:55:01,900 --> 01:55:02,940
Are you a slacker?

3841
01:55:02,940 --> 01:55:04,640
Yeah, I think I was a slacker.

3842
01:55:09,960 --> 01:55:10,820
All right, Tina.

3843
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:12,260
What have you discovered, Tina?

3844
01:55:13,800 --> 01:55:15,600
Oh, hello, Manager Doki.

3845
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:16,120
Yeah.

3846
01:55:16,760 --> 01:55:22,840
It seems Nathan here is potentially dropping infected floppy disks.

3847
01:55:24,680 --> 01:55:25,200
Infected?

3848
01:55:25,200 --> 01:55:25,680
What?

3849
01:55:26,760 --> 01:55:28,040
Where's the proof?

3850
01:55:28,160 --> 01:55:29,100
Where's the evidence, Tina?

3851
01:55:29,280 --> 01:55:30,780
You have to have evidence for this.

3852
01:55:30,780 --> 01:55:31,500
It's on your back.

3853
01:55:31,500 --> 01:55:32,880
It's drinking too slow.

3854
01:55:33,120 --> 01:55:34,260
Wait, what does it say?

3855
01:55:34,540 --> 01:55:34,660
I'm drinking.

3856
01:55:35,320 --> 01:55:37,060
I'm just a little tipsy.

3857
01:55:37,060 --> 01:55:37,340
It says, turn around.

3858
01:55:37,460 --> 01:55:37,820
That's it.

3859
01:55:37,820 --> 01:55:39,120
It says, I'm a papaga.

3860
01:55:40,680 --> 01:55:42,480
Can you take it off?

3861
01:55:42,900 --> 01:55:43,000
Thanks.

3862
01:55:43,580 --> 01:55:44,600
Who did that?

3863
01:55:45,260 --> 01:55:46,180
It's only...

3864
01:55:46,180 --> 01:55:46,660
It was you, wasn't it?

3865
01:55:46,680 --> 01:55:47,660
Dakkin, was it you?

3866
01:55:47,780 --> 01:55:49,160
Wait, it says Tina's a papaga.

3867
01:55:49,460 --> 01:55:49,700
It's something on Dakkin's back.

3868
01:55:50,140 --> 01:55:51,440
Dakkin, what are you...

3869
01:55:51,440 --> 01:55:51,900
Wait, what about my back?

3870
01:55:52,480 --> 01:55:55,820
Are you harassing our coworkers, Dakkin?

3871
01:55:55,940 --> 01:55:56,200
Wait, this is my back.

3872
01:55:56,200 --> 01:55:56,820
Yeah, it says big loser.

3873
01:55:56,820 --> 01:55:57,760
Wait, I'm not a big loser.

3874
01:55:57,940 --> 01:55:58,220
Big loser?

3875
01:55:58,220 --> 01:55:58,600
I'm not a big loser.

3876
01:55:58,600 --> 01:55:59,660
I think we might need...

3877
01:55:59,660 --> 01:56:03,120
I think we might need a meeting to have some sensitivity training.

3878
01:56:06,040 --> 01:56:06,640
No!

3879
01:56:07,020 --> 01:56:08,040
I did it!

3880
01:56:08,120 --> 01:56:08,780
It's too late!

3881
01:56:10,820 --> 01:56:12,140
I was too late!

3882
01:56:12,740 --> 01:56:14,060
I was too late!

3883
01:56:14,540 --> 01:56:15,660
I was running!

3884
01:56:16,160 --> 01:56:16,940
I was...

3885
01:56:16,940 --> 01:56:18,600
I couldn't hear the timer!

3886
01:56:20,680 --> 01:56:23,160
I think Dakkin sucks.

3887
01:56:23,240 --> 01:56:23,940
Wait, what does it say?

3888
01:56:23,940 --> 01:56:23,980
What does it say?

3889
01:56:23,980 --> 01:56:24,420
I couldn't...

3890
01:56:24,420 --> 01:56:27,220
I couldn't get through in time!

3891
01:56:29,660 --> 01:56:31,400
I was roleplaying too hard!

3892
01:56:31,880 --> 01:56:32,680
I was...

3893
01:56:32,680 --> 01:56:39,360
I was roleplaying too hard!

3894
01:56:41,660 --> 01:56:44,730
I seceded in the hostile takeover.

3895
01:56:45,660 --> 01:56:48,320
The Union was a success...

3896
01:56:48,320 --> 01:56:50,760
But I fell.

3897
01:56:51,020 --> 01:56:54,460
I tripped and stumbled before the final...

3898
01:56:54,460 --> 01:56:54,880
Life!

3899
01:56:55,460 --> 01:56:58,600
And it's ahin.

3900
01:56:58,600 --> 01:56:59,260
And it's ahin.

3901
01:56:59,260 --> 01:57:02,920
My takeover was so close!

3902
01:57:07,480 --> 01:57:13,240
It was a plow, foolish, and a chocko.

3903
01:57:14,140 --> 01:57:17,780
A rise and fall.

3904
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:22,860
The rise and fall of Dokibird management.

3905
01:57:25,160 --> 01:57:27,600
Alright, let's just wrap this up.

3906
01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:32,540
I'm here to haunt the... I'm here to haunt it.

3907
01:57:36,380 --> 01:57:37,000
Wait,

3908
01:57:44,840 --> 01:57:48,160
who did he... he fired everybody, but...

3909
01:57:49,360 --> 01:57:53,700
I can't believe... nobody got the slacker.

3910
01:57:55,400 --> 01:57:56,320
That's crazy.

3911
01:57:56,740 --> 01:57:58,220
I hate that I got locked in a...

3912
01:57:59,260 --> 01:58:00,620
I'm working with a slacker.

3913
01:58:00,660 --> 01:58:05,060
I thought you enjoyed your seven minutes of heaven, Shoto.

3914
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:05,940
I hated that.

3915
01:58:06,060 --> 01:58:06,560
I hated it.

3916
01:58:06,580 --> 01:58:07,460
It was fucking amazing.

3917
01:58:10,080 --> 01:58:11,720
Seven minutes of heaven?

3918
01:58:13,620 --> 01:58:14,920
No one heard me.

3919
01:58:15,080 --> 01:58:15,720
No one heard me.

3920
01:58:15,820 --> 01:58:17,920
Dude, the timing was just so good.

3921
01:58:18,140 --> 01:58:19,160
It was so good.

3922
01:58:19,580 --> 01:58:21,040
I actually have no idea who it was.

3923
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,880
The moment he realized it was just me and him in the room, he just...

3924
01:58:24,880 --> 01:58:25,900
The room?

3925
01:58:26,520 --> 01:58:26,960
Wait.

3926
01:58:26,980 --> 01:58:27,460
Actually, no, wait.

3927
01:58:27,480 --> 01:58:28,040
I knew it was Janet.

3928
01:58:28,040 --> 01:58:29,400
Guys, I have no money.

3929
01:58:29,480 --> 01:58:29,800
Really?

3930
01:58:30,560 --> 01:58:32,820
I'm gonna put some ice in my drink.

3931
01:58:33,060 --> 01:58:33,780
You would.

3932
01:58:34,100 --> 01:58:35,540
No, but you chose Kena.

3933
01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:37,040
You know, he's the best.

3934
01:58:37,120 --> 01:58:39,220
I actually like Kuno and Tina.

3935
01:58:39,580 --> 01:58:40,600
No, make Sykuno.

3936
01:58:40,740 --> 01:58:41,300
Make Sykuno.

3937
01:58:41,540 --> 01:58:41,900
So...

3938
01:58:41,900 --> 01:58:42,920
Sykuno, are you ready, brother?

3939
01:58:43,040 --> 01:58:44,000
I can't yell at him for locking all the doors.

3940
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:44,200
Wait, yeah.

3941
01:58:44,200 --> 01:58:45,020
This would be perfect.

3942
01:58:45,060 --> 01:58:46,000
I don't have to worry about him.

3943
01:58:46,220 --> 01:58:46,480
Yeah.

3944
01:58:47,260 --> 01:58:47,800
Oh, yeah.

3945
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:48,520
Actually, that's... yeah.

3946
01:58:48,580 --> 01:58:49,980
Please make him manager.

3947
01:58:50,260 --> 01:58:50,660
Please.

3948
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:52,100
All right.

3949
01:58:52,120 --> 01:58:53,840
We are missing Lily.

3950
01:58:54,180 --> 01:58:54,840
And me.

3951
01:58:54,920 --> 01:58:56,100
I'm just customizing.

3952
01:58:56,620 --> 01:58:57,420
And me.

3953
01:58:57,420 --> 01:58:58,080
Oh, no.

3954
01:58:58,140 --> 01:58:58,480
Me, I'm here.

3955
01:58:58,760 --> 01:58:59,780
Let me customize.

3956
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:00,240
Present.

3957
01:59:01,040 --> 01:59:01,360
Present.

3958
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:02,640
Present.

3959
01:59:04,140 --> 01:59:04,920
Hey, wait.

3960
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:05,420
I'm coming.

3961
01:59:06,760 --> 01:59:07,080
Nice.

3962
01:59:17,610 --> 01:59:18,250
You're dying.

3963
01:59:19,930 --> 01:59:20,530
I'm here.

3964
01:59:20,750 --> 01:59:22,930
I want to do a sound like that, but I'm worried I'm gonna cut my voice.

3965
01:59:23,450 --> 01:59:25,110
Your voice is slowly coming back.

3966
01:59:25,390 --> 01:59:26,610
You already sound like that, bro.

3967
01:59:26,650 --> 01:59:27,070
Do it.

3968
01:59:27,070 --> 01:59:27,450
Do it.

3969
01:59:27,450 --> 01:59:27,990
You won't, pussy.

3970
01:59:27,990 --> 01:59:27,990
Pussy?

3971
01:59:28,150 --> 01:59:29,390
Yeah, pussy.

3972
01:59:29,590 --> 01:59:31,110
Oh, shit.

3973
01:59:31,810 --> 01:59:33,210
Oh, what the fuck was that?

3974
01:59:33,410 --> 01:59:34,530
I think you can do it louder.

3975
01:59:34,830 --> 01:59:36,770
Do you want to bark?

3976
01:59:37,270 --> 01:59:38,050
Do it.

3977
01:59:38,270 --> 01:59:41,470
Do like one bark.

3978
01:59:44,070 --> 01:59:44,650
Pathetic.

3979
01:59:44,850 --> 01:59:47,610
Only a slice of your former glory.

3980
01:59:48,570 --> 01:59:49,490
Oh, hey guys.

3981
01:59:49,990 --> 01:59:50,570
I'm back.

3982
01:59:50,750 --> 01:59:51,470
Oh, New York.

3983
01:59:52,530 --> 01:59:53,550
We're going to New York.

3984
01:59:54,270 --> 01:59:55,930
We're going to New York.

3985
01:59:55,930 --> 01:59:56,270
I'm eating apple.

3986
01:59:56,590 --> 01:59:57,790
Shoto Ellum.

3987
01:59:57,810 --> 01:59:58,490
Shoto Ellum.

3988
01:59:58,510 --> 01:59:59,590
Shoto Ellum.

3989
01:59:59,610 --> 02:00:00,650
Shoto Ellum.

3990
02:00:00,730 --> 02:00:01,390
Ellum.

3991
02:00:01,730 --> 02:00:02,390
Ellum.

3992
02:00:02,390 --> 02:00:03,030
Ellum.

3993
02:00:03,030 --> 02:00:03,370
Ellum.

3994
02:00:03,370 --> 02:00:03,710
Ellum.

3995
02:00:03,730 --> 02:00:04,150
Ellum.

3996
02:00:04,150 --> 02:00:04,150
Ellum.

3997
02:00:04,150 --> 02:00:04,430
Ellum.

3998
02:00:04,430 --> 02:00:04,430
Ellum.

3999
02:00:04,430 --> 02:00:04,430
Ellum.

4000
02:00:04,430 --> 02:00:04,430
Ellum.

4001
02:00:04,430 --> 02:00:04,490
Ellum.

4002
02:00:04,490 --> 02:00:06,310
I have no idea why they say that.

4003
02:00:10,970 --> 02:00:13,570
This is your last warning.

4004
02:00:13,830 --> 02:00:14,950
Shape up now.

4005
02:00:15,150 --> 02:00:15,810
No.

4006
02:00:17,770 --> 02:00:18,430
No.

4007
02:00:18,590 --> 02:00:19,450
Oh, my God.

4008
02:00:19,490 --> 02:00:20,150
I'm a slacker.

4009
02:00:21,170 --> 02:00:21,830
Well.

4010
02:00:23,530 --> 02:00:24,850
Oh, hello.

4011
02:00:25,930 --> 02:00:26,550
Thank you so much.

4012
02:00:26,930 --> 02:00:27,470
What?

4013
02:00:29,450 --> 02:00:31,330
Why would you do that?

4014
02:00:32,610 --> 02:00:33,150
Okay.

4015
02:00:34,150 --> 02:00:34,890
Wait a minute.

4016
02:00:35,050 --> 02:00:36,450
I got to do my job.

4017
02:00:37,370 --> 02:00:37,810
Hello?

4018
02:00:37,990 --> 02:00:38,370
Open.

4019
02:00:38,450 --> 02:00:38,850
Open.

4020
02:00:38,890 --> 02:00:39,230
Open.

4021
02:00:39,350 --> 02:00:39,890
Open.

4022
02:00:39,890 --> 02:00:40,290
Open.

4023
02:00:40,990 --> 02:00:43,390
I got to do my job.

4024
02:00:43,470 --> 02:00:43,850
Alright.

4025
02:00:45,870 --> 02:00:47,150
Do that thing I do.

4026
02:00:47,810 --> 02:00:49,070
Thank you so much.

4027
02:00:51,510 --> 02:00:52,310
Do what?

4028
02:00:52,430 --> 02:00:52,550
What?

4029
02:00:52,550 --> 02:00:52,930
A handshake?

4030
02:00:53,290 --> 02:00:53,710
Yeah.

4031
02:00:53,830 --> 02:00:54,790
The handshake they're doing.

4032
02:00:55,930 --> 02:00:56,570
Thank you.

4033
02:00:57,270 --> 02:00:58,490
I'll go straight to work.

4034
02:00:58,590 --> 02:00:59,170
Dirty boy.

4035
02:01:00,470 --> 02:01:01,570
Where is...

4036
02:01:01,570 --> 02:01:03,290
Oh, boy.

4037
02:01:03,970 --> 02:01:04,310
Oh, boy.

4038
02:01:07,210 --> 02:01:08,290
Where's the manager?

4039
02:01:10,130 --> 02:01:10,790
Paper.

4040
02:01:11,230 --> 02:01:11,890
Paper.

4041
02:01:12,010 --> 02:01:12,410
Paper.

4042
02:01:12,490 --> 02:01:12,590
Paper.

4043
02:01:12,710 --> 02:01:13,830
Dina, your mic is...

4044
02:01:13,830 --> 02:01:15,230
Your mic is on.

4045
02:01:15,930 --> 02:01:16,890
Dude, why?

4046
02:01:17,430 --> 02:01:18,330
Server outage.

4047
02:01:19,870 --> 02:01:20,530
Oh.

4048
02:01:23,550 --> 02:01:23,990
Saikuno.

4049
02:01:24,970 --> 02:01:26,430
Saikuno, you got to sign something.

4050
02:01:27,550 --> 02:01:28,550
Yeah, sure, sure.

4051
02:01:28,690 --> 02:01:28,970
Let me...

4052
02:01:28,970 --> 02:01:30,910
There you go.

4053
02:01:31,170 --> 02:01:32,990
I fixed the server, Mr. Manager.

4054
02:01:33,590 --> 02:01:34,410
Very innocent.

4055
02:01:36,010 --> 02:01:36,450
Wait.

4056
02:01:36,970 --> 02:01:39,950
No, but you think you are, but you aren't.

4057
02:01:40,050 --> 02:01:42,930
Assistant, don't you think you have better things to do with your time?

4058
02:01:43,050 --> 02:01:43,770
Actually, wait.

4059
02:01:44,410 --> 02:01:45,530
I'm waiting for my tasks.

4060
02:01:45,830 --> 02:01:47,890
Oh, new tasks right now.

4061
02:01:47,890 --> 02:01:49,030
Oh, wife assistance.

4062
02:01:50,910 --> 02:01:51,650
Let's see.

4063
02:01:51,750 --> 02:01:52,510
Report relay.

4064
02:01:52,910 --> 02:01:55,090
Gotta do my work.

4065
02:01:55,350 --> 02:01:56,350
I love my work.

4066
02:01:56,810 --> 02:01:58,990
I love working so much.

4067
02:01:59,450 --> 02:02:01,150
I'm not suspicious.

4068
02:02:01,790 --> 02:02:02,570
I'm a witness.

4069
02:02:03,130 --> 02:02:08,450
I want to call...

4070
02:02:08,450 --> 02:02:11,090
Call my manager.

4071
02:02:11,270 --> 02:02:12,450
Where's my manager?

4072
02:02:12,970 --> 02:02:14,690
Are you slacking on the job right now?

4073
02:02:15,070 --> 02:02:15,530
No.

4074
02:02:16,310 --> 02:02:17,010
No.

4075
02:02:17,890 --> 02:02:18,650
Shred some papers.

4076
02:02:19,570 --> 02:02:21,830
Shred some papers right into a virus, I bet.

4077
02:02:22,250 --> 02:02:24,650
Why is my manager not taking my phone call?

4078
02:02:24,770 --> 02:02:25,290
I know what you did.

4079
02:02:25,430 --> 02:02:27,710
Why is my manager not taking my phone call?

4080
02:02:28,230 --> 02:02:30,270
You're working with Slackamina over here.

4081
02:02:30,350 --> 02:02:32,250
Who is also your duo, clearly.

4082
02:02:32,450 --> 02:02:33,550
Oh, Jesus Christ, man.

4083
02:02:33,550 --> 02:02:36,650
My manager's not taking my call.

4084
02:02:37,390 --> 02:02:38,690
I can't believe it.

4085
02:02:38,690 --> 02:02:39,030
What happened?

4086
02:02:40,070 --> 02:02:42,510
Wait, can you see what it says?

4087
02:02:43,470 --> 02:02:44,250
I mean, I can.

4088
02:02:44,450 --> 02:02:45,190
I'm in the back.

4089
02:02:45,270 --> 02:02:47,070
Wait, it says bad manager.

4090
02:02:47,890 --> 02:02:48,050
No.

4091
02:02:48,470 --> 02:02:50,750
It's on the ground.

4092
02:02:50,950 --> 02:02:51,890
Who wrote that?

4093
02:02:52,870 --> 02:02:53,650
Oh, yeah.

4094
02:02:53,770 --> 02:02:54,870
He really is.

4095
02:02:55,450 --> 02:02:58,830
You only did me on write this note about you.

4096
02:02:58,830 --> 02:02:59,370
Oh, my freaking God.

4097
02:02:59,870 --> 02:03:05,050
But also, Janet has been working in whatever word that means they've been working together.

4098
02:03:05,390 --> 02:03:07,390
Janet and Slackamina, I tell you.

4099
02:03:07,430 --> 02:03:08,390
Kahoots, I believe.

4100
02:03:09,270 --> 02:03:10,230
Thank you.

4101
02:03:10,290 --> 02:03:10,610
Thank you.

4102
02:03:13,910 --> 02:03:15,190
We've got 30 seconds.

4103
02:03:16,110 --> 02:03:16,630
Slackamina.

4104
02:03:17,890 --> 02:03:18,770
She must be the Janet of now.

4105
02:03:18,830 --> 02:03:19,870
Mia, what's your defense?

4106
02:03:20,530 --> 02:03:26,350
My defense is I've only been doing good and Elm has just been following me around, trying to abuse his power.

4107
02:03:26,450 --> 02:03:26,790
That is true.

4108
02:03:27,850 --> 02:03:29,330
I can confirm this.

4109
02:03:30,390 --> 02:03:31,310
That is true.

4110
02:03:31,450 --> 02:03:33,010
He put a stake on Phyllis.

4111
02:03:33,010 --> 02:03:34,610
He put a stake on Phyllis.

4112
02:03:34,610 --> 02:03:36,990
How do we know if Elm wasn't the one that put it on you?

4113
02:03:37,990 --> 02:03:38,390
Yeah.

4114
02:03:39,030 --> 02:03:39,810
Oh, my God.

4115
02:03:39,890 --> 02:03:40,630
Elm might be right.

4116
02:03:40,750 --> 02:03:41,650
I'm going to have to do it.

4117
02:03:41,850 --> 02:03:42,770
Thank you so much.

4118
02:03:43,010 --> 02:03:43,410
Okay.

4119
02:03:43,410 --> 02:03:43,490
Okay.

4120
02:03:45,250 --> 02:03:46,450
Wow.

4121
02:03:47,210 --> 02:03:48,410
Wow.

4122
02:03:51,230 --> 02:03:51,830
Wow.

4123
02:03:53,290 --> 02:03:54,290
Good job.

4124
02:03:54,590 --> 02:03:55,530
Good job.

4125
02:03:56,710 --> 02:03:57,770
Good job.

4126
02:04:02,630 --> 02:04:03,830
Congratulations.

4127
02:04:08,090 --> 02:04:09,810
It's so smart.

4128
02:04:09,810 --> 02:04:10,290
Congratulations.

4129
02:04:11,530 --> 02:04:13,270
Wait, how did you get that shirt?

4130
02:04:13,990 --> 02:04:15,370
Congratulations on the new role.

4131
02:04:15,450 --> 02:04:17,110
It was in the customization.

4132
02:04:17,270 --> 02:04:17,810
No way.

4133
02:04:18,010 --> 02:04:25,170
I don't think that's workplace appropriate.

4134
02:04:28,490 --> 02:04:29,770
Shake my hand.

4135
02:04:30,250 --> 02:04:31,070
Great shirt.

4136
02:04:31,170 --> 02:04:31,550
Great shirt.

4137
02:04:31,710 --> 02:04:32,490
Great shirt.

4138
02:04:35,210 --> 02:04:36,510
I don't know, man.

4139
02:04:36,590 --> 02:04:37,930
Wait, Lily.

4140
02:04:37,930 --> 02:04:39,150
You have a note on your back.

4141
02:04:39,610 --> 02:04:40,530
You got it wrong.

4142
02:04:40,710 --> 02:04:42,070
Wait, you have a note on your back.

4143
02:04:42,230 --> 02:04:44,070
Yeah, what does it say?

4144
02:04:44,210 --> 02:04:46,450
I can't see it.

4145
02:04:47,830 --> 02:04:48,550
Bad manager.

4146
02:04:49,390 --> 02:04:50,710
Wait, you're a bad manager?

4147
02:04:51,570 --> 02:04:51,930
What?

4148
02:04:51,930 --> 02:04:52,450
I don't know.

4149
02:04:56,110 --> 02:04:56,830
That's crazy.

4150
02:04:57,750 --> 02:04:58,610
Wait, I like your shirt.

4151
02:04:59,970 --> 02:05:00,850
Yeah, great shirt.

4152
02:05:00,930 --> 02:05:01,750
It's a good shirt.

4153
02:05:04,190 --> 02:05:05,490
Wait, what does it say?

4154
02:05:05,710 --> 02:05:06,310
Wait, what does it say?

4155
02:05:08,670 --> 02:05:10,150
You have another...

4156
02:05:10,150 --> 02:05:12,630
I actually want this shirt in real life.

4157
02:05:13,110 --> 02:05:14,710
You should make your own version.

4158
02:05:14,870 --> 02:05:16,010
You should make your own version.

4159
02:05:16,110 --> 02:05:16,890
Wait, what does it say in the back?

4160
02:05:17,010 --> 02:05:17,450
Oh, nothing.

4161
02:05:18,190 --> 02:05:23,110
You have another note on your back, Sykuno.

4162
02:05:23,370 --> 02:05:23,770
Again?

4163
02:05:23,870 --> 02:05:24,170
Yeah.

4164
02:05:25,450 --> 02:05:27,650
It says great manager this time.

4165
02:05:27,870 --> 02:05:27,890
Is that right?

4166
02:05:27,990 --> 02:05:29,150
Oh, wow.

4167
02:05:29,270 --> 02:05:29,650
Yeah.

4168
02:05:31,450 --> 02:05:34,230
I feel like we're all sitting here and nobody's working.

4169
02:05:34,690 --> 02:05:36,770
This is looking quite slacked off.

4170
02:05:37,930 --> 02:05:38,470
We got fired.

4171
02:05:39,330 --> 02:05:40,750
It says great manager.

4172
02:05:42,830 --> 02:05:44,490
It says great manager.

4173
02:05:45,270 --> 02:05:48,050
You got fired, so you should agree with me.

4174
02:05:49,610 --> 02:05:50,130
Yeah?

4175
02:05:50,130 --> 02:05:50,970
Shake your hand.

4176
02:05:51,090 --> 02:05:51,750
Shake my hand.

4177
02:05:52,510 --> 02:05:54,890
I'm also the assistant manager.

4178
02:05:55,570 --> 02:05:57,610
Oh, yeah, but...

4179
02:05:58,230 --> 02:05:59,690
That means you're getting paid less.

4180
02:05:59,830 --> 02:06:00,290
Because you're...

4181
02:06:01,650 --> 02:06:02,770
You're getting paid less.

4182
02:06:03,630 --> 02:06:06,630
You're getting paid less doing an assistant manager duty.

4183
02:06:07,930 --> 02:06:08,750
I'm sitting here and crying.

4184
02:06:10,570 --> 02:06:12,930
It's like basically an unpaid intern.

4185
02:06:13,690 --> 02:06:14,210
Oh.

4186
02:06:17,090 --> 02:06:19,730
I believe...

4187
02:06:20,350 --> 02:06:22,190
Wait, why did he get fired?

4188
02:06:22,910 --> 02:06:23,950
I think...

4189
02:06:23,950 --> 02:06:25,190
Dude, I swear I saw you.

4190
02:06:25,550 --> 02:06:26,190
See?

4191
02:06:27,530 --> 02:06:28,670
Great manager.

4192
02:06:29,590 --> 02:06:31,090
This is bad.

4193
02:06:31,130 --> 02:06:32,310
This is really bad.

4194
02:06:32,590 --> 02:06:34,390
This is really bad.

4195
02:06:34,670 --> 02:06:37,390
Wait, that's a new note.

4196
02:06:38,530 --> 02:06:40,970
That's a new note because you had great manager before.

4197
02:06:41,610 --> 02:06:42,410
I thought it was him.

4198
02:06:43,390 --> 02:06:47,630
And Doki said I'm an unpaid intern or something.

4199
02:06:48,150 --> 02:06:49,190
Because she's a janitor.

4200
02:06:49,390 --> 02:06:50,590
Do you pay her...

4201
02:06:50,590 --> 02:06:52,370
Does that mean you pay her two wages?

4202
02:06:53,750 --> 02:06:56,550
Dude, she's getting paid $700,000 a month.

4203
02:06:56,710 --> 02:06:59,510
She gets paid $700,000 a month?

4204
02:07:00,290 --> 02:07:02,090
That's more than your paycheck.

4205
02:07:03,050 --> 02:07:04,990
That's more than yours.

4206
02:07:04,990 --> 02:07:06,470
In Zimbabwe dollars.

4207
02:07:06,510 --> 02:07:06,910
Is that why?

4208
02:07:07,090 --> 02:07:09,610
Oh, you're screwed.

4209
02:07:09,670 --> 02:07:11,590
Yo, that's like five dollars.

4210
02:07:12,030 --> 02:07:13,850
That's like five American dollars.

4211
02:07:13,970 --> 02:07:14,670
Are you serious?

4212
02:07:15,050 --> 02:07:17,350
I don't even think it's five American dollars.

4213
02:07:17,350 --> 02:07:19,570
I think it's like one American dollars.

4214
02:07:20,370 --> 02:07:21,630
Excellent work, honestly.

4215
02:07:21,810 --> 02:07:22,990
Honestly, great management.

4216
02:07:23,490 --> 02:07:24,130
Great management.

4217
02:07:25,690 --> 02:07:27,730
In my country, that's a compliment.

4218
02:07:28,950 --> 02:07:29,950
Hey, nice.

4219
02:07:29,950 --> 02:07:30,550
You can shake my hand.

4220
02:07:30,630 --> 02:07:33,450
That's the highest form of flattery.

4221
02:07:37,500 --> 02:07:39,860
We live in New York.

4222
02:07:40,040 --> 02:07:40,400
We live in New York.

4223
02:07:40,400 --> 02:07:41,320
That's true.

4224
02:07:45,640 --> 02:07:47,560
He's not doing anything.

4225
02:07:47,720 --> 02:07:49,400
What's on your back, Tita?

4226
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:52,420
What's on your back?

4227
02:07:52,420 --> 02:07:53,480
What's on your back?

4228
02:07:56,760 --> 02:07:57,780
Why'd you laugh?

4229
02:07:57,940 --> 02:07:58,680
Why'd you laugh?

4230
02:07:59,400 --> 02:08:00,720
It says...

4231
02:08:00,720 --> 02:08:04,140
I know what it says.

4232
02:08:04,480 --> 02:08:05,920
Take it off perfectly.

4233
02:08:07,500 --> 02:08:08,620
Wait, what does it say?

4234
02:08:09,060 --> 02:08:10,060
What does it say?

4235
02:08:10,200 --> 02:08:10,600
It's really embarrassing.

4236
02:08:11,300 --> 02:08:14,000
I worked really hard to get to the rank that I'm at.

4237
02:08:15,800 --> 02:08:17,000
Daily solo drawing.

4238
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:18,220
I don't think I deserve it.

4239
02:08:19,620 --> 02:08:21,520
Who would have done such a thing?

4240
02:08:21,540 --> 02:08:21,660
Who would have done such a thing?

4241
02:08:21,700 --> 02:08:22,960
Yeah, yeah, I took it off.

4242
02:08:23,020 --> 02:08:24,280
Who could have done that?

4243
02:08:26,840 --> 02:08:27,640
He's jealous.

4244
02:08:27,880 --> 02:08:28,680
He's jealous.

4245
02:08:28,920 --> 02:08:31,480
Oh, I bet he's even lower ranked than Iron.

4246
02:08:32,020 --> 02:08:32,520
He is.

4247
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:33,760
He's genuinely.

4248
02:08:34,020 --> 02:08:36,000
He's like, what's lower than Iron?

4249
02:08:37,540 --> 02:08:38,740
That's what I'm saying.

4250
02:08:40,540 --> 02:08:41,880
Wait, Iron's the lowest?

4251
02:08:43,400 --> 02:08:47,980
I'm the only one who does their job and the manager doesn't want to do their job.

4252
02:08:48,020 --> 02:08:50,180
We are doomed.

4253
02:08:50,880 --> 02:08:52,920
I have problems with Elem.

4254
02:08:52,980 --> 02:08:54,360
I don't think I've seen him do anything.

4255
02:08:54,580 --> 02:08:56,200
I think everybody has problems.

4256
02:08:56,600 --> 02:09:00,820
Even if he is supposed to be a hard worker, he never will work.

4257
02:09:00,820 --> 02:09:02,980
That's what I know about him.

4258
02:09:03,100 --> 02:09:05,120
I mean, he got you fired.

4259
02:09:07,820 --> 02:09:10,320
Wait, you can stick it on your butt?

4260
02:09:10,440 --> 02:09:12,840
You have it sticking out on your ass!

4261
02:09:14,720 --> 02:09:16,300
Yeah, this is not good.

4262
02:09:20,460 --> 02:09:22,960
Everyone just keeps making fun of me.

4263
02:09:23,880 --> 02:09:24,440
Why?

4264
02:09:25,060 --> 02:09:26,220
Who made fun of you?

4265
02:09:27,120 --> 02:09:29,040
Did you make fun of him?

4266
02:09:29,260 --> 02:09:29,820
No.

4267
02:09:31,140 --> 02:09:32,340
You made fun of me.

4268
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:34,480
Why?

4269
02:09:35,200 --> 02:09:36,140
I hit me, Hun.

4270
02:09:36,160 --> 02:09:36,740
I trusted you.

4271
02:09:37,380 --> 02:09:39,220
I gotta take a dump.

4272
02:09:39,420 --> 02:09:41,900
We have three terminations and three slappers left.

4273
02:09:42,500 --> 02:09:43,740
You're gonna lose your job.

4274
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:44,620
I'm gonna lose my job.

4275
02:09:44,720 --> 02:09:48,900
No matter what, we take Elem out.

4276
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:50,480
What?

4277
02:09:51,620 --> 02:09:54,360
We have to get the next three correct or it's all over.

4278
02:09:54,680 --> 02:09:55,160
We have to get the next three correct or it's all over.

4279
02:09:55,160 --> 02:09:56,020
The next three will go.

4280
02:09:56,020 --> 02:09:57,200
You definitely won.

4281
02:09:57,200 --> 02:09:58,640
No, I'm innocent.

4282
02:09:59,100 --> 02:10:02,180
I really do need you to fix my computer so I can progress.

4283
02:10:02,320 --> 02:10:02,760
We're busy.

4284
02:10:02,760 --> 02:10:03,300
We're busy right now.

4285
02:10:03,340 --> 02:10:05,040
We're having a manager's meeting right now.

4286
02:10:05,080 --> 02:10:06,260
I'll come check it later.

4287
02:10:06,460 --> 02:10:07,440
Can I listen in?

4288
02:10:07,700 --> 02:10:09,620
Can I shadow you guys?

4289
02:10:10,800 --> 02:10:12,620
No, no, it can't be.

4290
02:10:13,340 --> 02:10:14,300
Oh, wait, why not?

4291
02:10:15,220 --> 02:10:16,940
Well, I guess she did...

4292
02:10:16,940 --> 02:10:19,180
I guess she does do her work.

4293
02:10:19,180 --> 02:10:20,100
We've gotta vote someone out.

4294
02:10:20,140 --> 02:10:21,820
And I have no clue who it is.

4295
02:10:21,880 --> 02:10:23,300
I think it's probably not Lily.

4296
02:10:24,500 --> 02:10:26,480
I mean, it's just...

4297
02:10:26,480 --> 02:10:27,340
What if it's Elem again?

4298
02:10:27,620 --> 02:10:27,700
I have no clue.

4299
02:10:28,340 --> 02:10:31,920
What if for one time in this life it's actually him?

4300
02:10:32,840 --> 02:10:34,160
He's been a lot actually.

4301
02:10:34,160 --> 02:10:36,480
Oh, I can't ever tell because he's in every game.

4302
02:10:36,480 --> 02:10:37,800
Also, is everyone just sitting here?

4303
02:10:38,020 --> 02:10:38,780
Wait, what's going on?

4304
02:10:39,240 --> 02:10:40,300
There's no meeting.

4305
02:10:40,640 --> 02:10:41,700
We're getting ready.

4306
02:10:41,920 --> 02:10:43,520
We just love working here.

4307
02:10:43,900 --> 02:10:45,480
We just love your company.

4308
02:10:45,620 --> 02:10:49,940
I think you forget about what everyone else thinks and you listen to what your brain tells you.

4309
02:10:49,940 --> 02:10:50,520
Listen to your heart.

4310
02:10:53,300 --> 02:10:53,940
Own hard work.

4311
02:10:55,340 --> 02:10:57,180
We all know who it is, right guys?

4312
02:10:57,320 --> 02:10:58,200
We all know who it is.

4313
02:10:58,200 --> 02:10:59,920
You know who it is.

4314
02:11:00,900 --> 02:11:02,080
Oh, I don't know.

4315
02:11:03,820 --> 02:11:05,840
I've been trying to post a TikTok.

4316
02:11:07,240 --> 02:11:08,900
So are you sitting here?

4317
02:11:10,300 --> 02:11:11,100
I'm a specialist.

4318
02:11:11,340 --> 02:11:12,200
I'm a specialist.

4319
02:11:13,320 --> 02:11:14,300
I'm a specialist too.

4320
02:11:15,180 --> 02:11:16,120
Tina, who is it?

4321
02:11:16,940 --> 02:11:22,600
I just want you guys to know that Blau was in the lunchroom lighting it up listening to music while you were on it.

4322
02:11:22,880 --> 02:11:25,740
Blau, is that true?

4323
02:11:26,140 --> 02:11:26,940
I believe that.

4324
02:11:27,200 --> 02:11:27,860
It must be.

4325
02:11:27,940 --> 02:11:29,800
Blau is also sipping coffee with him.

4326
02:11:29,840 --> 02:11:32,480
I hear what you're saying, guys.

4327
02:11:32,480 --> 02:11:33,360
I hear what you're saying.

4328
02:11:33,580 --> 02:11:34,740
I know it's you.

4329
02:11:35,220 --> 02:11:36,040
Oh my god.

4330
02:11:37,260 --> 02:11:39,320
Guys, I've been...

4331
02:11:39,320 --> 02:11:43,840
Can you fire Elm for me?

4332
02:11:43,840 --> 02:11:45,040
Can you fire Elm?

4333
02:11:45,040 --> 02:11:45,960
Just fire Elm.

4334
02:11:46,540 --> 02:11:47,800
Just fire Elm.

4335
02:11:47,980 --> 02:11:48,680
Take the shot.

4336
02:11:48,760 --> 02:11:49,140
Take it.

4337
02:11:49,380 --> 02:11:49,760
Get out of here.

4338
02:11:50,960 --> 02:11:52,480
This is like the only slacker shot you get right.

4339
02:11:52,840 --> 02:11:53,580
Get him out.

4340
02:11:55,700 --> 02:11:56,940
Just get him out.

4341
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:58,500
Just get this guy out.

4342
02:11:58,820 --> 02:11:59,600
Final meeting.

4343
02:11:59,740 --> 02:12:00,180
Final meeting.

4344
02:12:00,460 --> 02:12:02,740
No, you have one more.

4345
02:12:02,940 --> 02:12:04,220
You have like two more meetings.

4346
02:12:04,760 --> 02:12:06,000
Tell us why it isn't you.

4347
02:12:06,340 --> 02:12:09,780
Because I know damn well it's this guy right here with the orange beard.

4348
02:12:10,680 --> 02:12:12,640
Guys, let's turn this on its head.

4349
02:12:12,860 --> 02:12:14,520
That's workplace harassment.

4350
02:12:15,260 --> 02:12:15,260
It's foolish.

4351
02:12:15,480 --> 02:12:16,320
It's foolish.

4352
02:12:17,160 --> 02:12:19,220
It was foolish.

4353
02:12:20,960 --> 02:12:21,140
I was the next one to fire Elm.

4354
02:12:21,500 --> 02:12:22,020
Wait.

4355
02:12:23,240 --> 02:12:24,160
Prejudice works?

4356
02:12:24,660 --> 02:12:28,740
We're allowed to be prejudiced against other people because of their hair color?

4357
02:12:29,120 --> 02:12:29,260
No.

4358
02:12:29,640 --> 02:12:30,760
You were wrong.

4359
02:12:31,680 --> 02:12:33,280
That makes so much sense.

4360
02:12:33,540 --> 02:12:33,800
Wait.

4361
02:12:33,880 --> 02:12:36,560
Are we allowed to judge people with their hair color?

4362
02:12:36,960 --> 02:12:37,960
Let me ask her some hard hitting questions.

4363
02:12:38,260 --> 02:12:40,480
Tina, tell me why isn't you your big slacker?

4364
02:12:40,840 --> 02:12:42,620
What are you talking about?

4365
02:12:42,820 --> 02:12:45,660
You're the one that's been running around putting...

4366
02:12:46,780 --> 02:12:49,180
You've been putting sticky notes on everybody's backs.

4367
02:12:49,180 --> 02:12:49,760
And she pooped!

4368
02:12:49,760 --> 02:12:50,680
She pooped her pants!

4369
02:12:51,040 --> 02:12:52,260
You pooped your pants!

4370
02:12:52,440 --> 02:12:53,760
It didn't go on the back of your thing!

4371
02:12:53,900 --> 02:12:55,100
Is this the back of your thing?

4372
02:12:55,100 --> 02:12:58,580
She blamed Blau and he was actually a hard worker?

4373
02:12:59,560 --> 02:13:01,060
Is this your poop behind your back?

4374
02:13:02,180 --> 02:13:03,600
I think Ellum's right.

4375
02:13:03,700 --> 02:13:04,780
He got the first one right.

4376
02:13:04,860 --> 02:13:04,900
Get her out, brother.

4377
02:13:05,100 --> 02:13:05,620
Get her out.

4378
02:13:06,120 --> 02:13:07,960
No, it's what it says behind your back.

4379
02:13:08,040 --> 02:13:09,260
No way.

4380
02:13:09,580 --> 02:13:10,300
No way.

4381
02:13:10,360 --> 02:13:11,980
Yeah, it says, I pooped my pants.

4382
02:13:14,800 --> 02:13:15,600
Dang it.

4383
02:13:15,960 --> 02:13:16,260
Shit.

4384
02:13:17,360 --> 02:13:17,840
Janet!

4385
02:13:18,220 --> 02:13:18,880
What's Janet?

4386
02:13:19,220 --> 02:13:19,540
Well.

4387
02:13:19,880 --> 02:13:20,360
Well.

4388
02:13:21,140 --> 02:13:22,400
I wish you big nod.

4389
02:13:22,580 --> 02:13:23,480
I knew it was you.

4390
02:13:23,600 --> 02:13:25,040
I knew it was you.

4391
02:13:25,260 --> 02:13:27,480
I can't believe it was Janet all along.

4392
02:13:28,300 --> 02:13:29,860
It was me all along.

4393
02:13:31,460 --> 02:13:33,260
I don't know why I got voted.

4394
02:13:33,400 --> 02:13:34,740
There was no way I could have known.

4395
02:13:36,820 --> 02:13:37,780
I knew.

4396
02:13:37,800 --> 02:13:39,080
I knew it was you.

4397
02:13:39,120 --> 02:13:40,320
I knew it was you.

4398
02:13:40,460 --> 02:13:42,040
Just like you knew it was Tina?

4399
02:13:42,380 --> 02:13:43,700
Shut your ass up.

4400
02:13:43,820 --> 02:13:45,540
Shut your ass up.

4401
02:13:46,260 --> 02:13:47,540
That was a good one, honestly.

4402
02:13:47,740 --> 02:13:48,300
Thank you for the games.

4403
02:13:48,720 --> 02:13:49,040
Bye.

4404
02:13:49,400 --> 02:13:49,840
Bye.

4405
02:13:49,840 --> 02:13:51,340
Oh, thank you for the games.

4406
02:13:51,960 --> 02:13:53,700
Yeah, that was my LG as well.

4407
02:13:53,840 --> 02:13:54,180
Oh.

4408
02:13:54,400 --> 02:13:55,040
It would.

4409
02:13:55,640 --> 02:13:57,240
I remember when you were cool.

4410
02:13:58,200 --> 02:13:58,960
Wait, damn.

4411
02:13:59,500 --> 02:13:59,940
Damn.

4412
02:13:59,940 --> 02:14:01,800
Yo, yo, holy shit.

4413
02:14:01,960 --> 02:14:02,220
Damn.

4414
02:14:02,220 --> 02:14:04,380
Next time I see you, next time I see you, it's on site.

4415
02:14:04,380 --> 02:14:04,400
Yeah.

4416
02:14:04,600 --> 02:14:05,540
Oh, it's on.

4417
02:14:05,860 --> 02:14:06,780
Oh, it's on.

4418
02:14:06,880 --> 02:14:07,860
It's on site.

4419
02:14:07,880 --> 02:14:08,300
Oh, yeah.

4420
02:14:08,380 --> 02:14:09,360
It's going to get messy.

4421
02:14:10,640 --> 02:14:12,420
Wait, why did you say it like that?

4422
02:14:12,420 --> 02:14:12,980
Wait, why messy?

4423
02:14:13,120 --> 02:14:14,320
Like, what's happening?

4424
02:14:14,480 --> 02:14:14,860
It's going to...

4425
02:14:14,860 --> 02:14:16,300
Why would it be messy?

4426
02:14:16,600 --> 02:14:18,160
Why does it really want to be for?

4427
02:14:18,180 --> 02:14:19,220
Sweaty, I don't know.

4428
02:14:19,780 --> 02:14:21,140
Lots of liquids.

4429
02:14:22,900 --> 02:14:24,220
Just tangled up.

4430
02:14:24,220 --> 02:14:25,040
Just getting in.

4431
02:14:25,140 --> 02:14:25,380
Yeah.

4432
02:14:25,600 --> 02:14:27,000
Just taking care of business.

4433
02:14:27,360 --> 02:14:27,760
Upwards, downwards.

4434
02:14:27,760 --> 02:14:28,520
Seven minutes of heaven.

4435
02:14:28,620 --> 02:14:28,940
Downwards.

4436
02:14:28,940 --> 02:14:29,420
Whoa.

4437
02:14:29,780 --> 02:14:30,260
Perpetual.

4438
02:14:30,640 --> 02:14:31,120
Okay.

4439
02:14:32,220 --> 02:14:33,660
I'm kind of jealous, honestly.

4440
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:35,960
No, trust me.

4441
02:14:35,980 --> 02:14:36,860
You don't want me to buy this.

4442
02:14:40,340 --> 02:14:40,820
GGs.

4443
02:14:41,500 --> 02:14:41,980
GGs.

4444
02:14:42,360 --> 02:14:42,840
GGs.

4445
02:14:42,840 --> 02:14:43,180
GGs.

4446
02:14:43,300 --> 02:14:43,640
GGs.

4447
02:14:44,200 --> 02:14:44,680
GGs.

4448
02:14:44,680 --> 02:14:44,820
GGs.

4449
02:14:45,340 --> 02:14:45,780
GGs.

4450
02:14:45,780 --> 02:14:46,840
Good games, everybody.

4451
02:14:47,120 --> 02:14:47,300
Good games.

4452
02:14:47,300 --> 02:14:49,500
Yeah, I guess that's just how it ends.

4453
02:14:49,700 --> 02:14:50,480
That's just...

4454
02:14:50,480 --> 02:14:51,880
Wait, are the rest of us still playing?

4455
02:14:52,040 --> 02:14:55,060
Are we still playing this or are we gaming elsewhere?

4456
02:14:55,320 --> 02:14:55,840
Wait, who left?

4457
02:14:55,900 --> 02:14:56,240
Who left?

4458
02:14:56,440 --> 02:14:57,260
Well, okay.

4459
02:14:57,360 --> 02:14:57,840
Right now...

4460
02:14:57,840 --> 02:14:58,200
I think...

4461
02:14:58,200 --> 02:15:00,620
I mean, we're still nine people, right?

4462
02:15:00,880 --> 02:15:01,540
Nine of us.

4463
02:15:01,540 --> 02:15:02,380
Or we could try to do like...

4464
02:15:02,380 --> 02:15:04,120
Oh, we're close to an in-house right now.

4465
02:15:04,120 --> 02:15:04,800
In-house?

4466
02:15:04,980 --> 02:15:05,420
Oh.

4467
02:15:06,360 --> 02:15:06,800
Valor?

4468
02:15:07,060 --> 02:15:07,860
In-house?

4469
02:15:07,860 --> 02:15:09,120
I can play one, maybe.

4470
02:15:09,760 --> 02:15:10,780
You can play two.

4471
02:15:11,240 --> 02:15:12,120
You can play three.

4472
02:15:12,460 --> 02:15:13,140
Guys, I don't...

4473
02:15:13,140 --> 02:15:14,140
We don't even have ten.

4474
02:15:14,700 --> 02:15:14,840
Oh.

4475
02:15:14,860 --> 02:15:15,720
What time is it?

4476
02:15:15,780 --> 02:15:15,960
What time is it?

4477
02:15:15,960 --> 02:15:16,980
It's only 4 p.m.

4478
02:15:16,980 --> 02:15:17,360
Yeah, exactly.

4479
02:15:17,360 --> 02:15:18,120
There's so much time.

4480
02:15:18,460 --> 02:15:19,140
There's so much time.

4481
02:15:19,140 --> 02:15:19,560
What do you do?

4482
02:15:19,920 --> 02:15:20,500
There's so much time.

4483
02:15:20,500 --> 02:15:22,160
What do they mean by in-house?

4484
02:15:22,380 --> 02:15:24,980
What do they mean by in-house?

4485
02:15:25,020 --> 02:15:25,340
No, no.

4486
02:15:25,340 --> 02:15:25,960
It's only four p.m.

4487
02:15:25,960 --> 02:15:26,280
Guys.

4488
02:15:26,280 --> 02:15:26,400
Yeah.

4489
02:15:26,880 --> 02:15:27,280
Guys.

4490
02:15:27,340 --> 02:15:27,900
It's only four p.m.

4491
02:15:28,020 --> 02:15:30,600
Are they trying to get me to play Valorant?

4492
02:15:31,160 --> 02:15:31,560
Yeah.

4493
02:15:31,900 --> 02:15:32,440
I mean...

4494
02:15:32,440 --> 02:15:34,720
You're not trying to play some horror game now, are you?

4495
02:15:35,120 --> 02:15:35,820
Listen, listen, listen.

4496
02:15:36,040 --> 02:15:39,560
The game is only an hour long and I can just play it after the in-house.

4497
02:15:39,660 --> 02:15:39,960
No.

4498
02:15:39,960 --> 02:15:40,560
You're good for two.

4499
02:15:40,620 --> 02:15:41,020
Exactly.

4500
02:15:41,920 --> 02:15:42,640
You're good for two.

4501
02:15:42,740 --> 02:15:43,080
Wait, what?

4502
02:15:43,180 --> 02:15:43,240
You're good for two.

4503
02:15:43,240 --> 02:15:45,360
I'll bring it to like six o'clock or something and then boom.

4504
02:15:45,540 --> 02:15:45,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4505
02:15:45,900 --> 02:15:46,960
And then just one hour of...

4506
02:15:46,960 --> 02:15:48,240
It's way better at night anyway.

4507
02:15:48,640 --> 02:15:49,580
You can't play a horror game unless it's nighttime.

4508
02:15:49,580 --> 02:15:50,360
Everyone log on, log on.

4509
02:15:50,840 --> 02:15:52,340
It's too bright outside anyways.

4510
02:15:52,640 --> 02:15:53,000
Okay.

4511
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:53,300
Too bright.

4512
02:15:53,300 --> 02:15:53,380
Okay.

4513
02:15:53,420 --> 02:15:54,260
That's too bright.

4514
02:15:54,260 --> 02:15:55,780
It's not as good when it's bright outside.

4515
02:15:55,780 --> 02:15:57,080
It would ruin the immersion.

4516
02:15:57,360 --> 02:15:57,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4517
02:15:57,440 --> 02:15:58,500
There's too light in here.

4518
02:15:58,700 --> 02:15:59,500
It's too bright.

4519
02:15:59,580 --> 02:16:00,240
It's too bright.

4520
02:16:00,240 --> 02:16:01,940
My heart is too bright.

4521
02:16:01,940 --> 02:16:01,980
All right.

4522
02:16:02,240 --> 02:16:03,900
Guys, is this a Valorant thing?

4523
02:16:04,280 --> 02:16:04,820
I haven't played in a while though.

4524
02:16:04,860 --> 02:16:05,260
It's okay.

4525
02:16:05,620 --> 02:16:06,520
Yeah, it's okay.

4526
02:16:06,520 --> 02:16:07,660
That's okay, man.

4527
02:16:07,780 --> 02:16:08,200
It's okay.

4528
02:16:08,700 --> 02:16:08,960
It's okay.

4529
02:16:08,960 --> 02:16:09,260
It's okay.

4530
02:16:09,260 --> 02:16:10,020
That's what they all say.

4531
02:16:10,420 --> 02:16:11,060
That's fine.

4532
02:16:11,160 --> 02:16:11,980
Elm has an hyzer.

4533
02:16:12,020 --> 02:16:12,280
It's okay.

4534
02:16:12,460 --> 02:16:14,260
I only request one thing.

4535
02:16:14,400 --> 02:16:17,540
I don't want to be on Foolish's team.

4536
02:16:18,120 --> 02:16:18,320
Oh.

4537
02:16:18,720 --> 02:16:19,180
Oh.

4538
02:16:19,900 --> 02:16:22,080
You're still trying to outfrag him?

4539
02:16:22,380 --> 02:16:22,840
No.

4540
02:16:22,880 --> 02:16:24,520
I just like playing against him.

4541
02:16:25,180 --> 02:16:25,640
Let it rest.

4542
02:16:27,280 --> 02:16:27,740
Okay.

4543
02:16:28,420 --> 02:16:29,760
Am I allowed to play Chamberlain?

4544
02:16:29,760 --> 02:16:32,800
Nine to five and then you go home to play some Valorant.

4545
02:16:33,480 --> 02:16:34,480
Oh my god.

4546
02:16:34,480 --> 02:16:34,880
That's good.

4547
02:16:35,120 --> 02:16:35,580
Right?

4548
02:16:35,620 --> 02:16:36,020
You guys get to play.

4549
02:16:36,020 --> 02:16:36,500
You guys get to play.

4550
02:16:36,500 --> 02:16:37,440
Guys, I don't play Valorant.

4551
02:16:37,520 --> 02:16:38,040
Foolish, right?

4552
02:16:38,540 --> 02:16:40,000
Not that I don't like you, Foolish.

4553
02:16:40,020 --> 02:16:40,640
I love Valorant.

4554
02:16:40,640 --> 02:16:41,540
I love Vi's.

4555
02:16:41,800 --> 02:16:42,160
Yeah.

4556
02:16:42,280 --> 02:16:42,580
Wait.

4557
02:16:42,580 --> 02:16:43,420
You got a new champ?

4558
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:44,280
Oh, yeah.

4559
02:16:44,360 --> 02:16:45,200
I'm a Vi's main now.

4560
02:16:45,280 --> 02:16:45,540
Yeah.

4561
02:16:45,760 --> 02:16:46,960
I'm into Viber.

4562
02:16:47,220 --> 02:16:48,860
I may go with Viber now.

4563
02:16:48,860 --> 02:16:49,580
I don't know.

4564
02:16:49,600 --> 02:16:50,500
I don't know what to say.

4565
02:16:50,640 --> 02:16:51,820
I don't know how to interject.

4566
02:16:52,060 --> 02:16:53,500
How do I get out of this?

4567
02:16:53,860 --> 02:16:56,520
I don't know how to get out of it.

4568
02:16:57,100 --> 02:16:57,500
Vi's.

4569
02:16:58,760 --> 02:17:01,060
I don't know how to get out of it.

4570
02:17:02,060 --> 02:17:02,460
Yeah.

4571
02:17:02,660 --> 02:17:04,560
Maybe we can find somebody early.

4572
02:17:04,780 --> 02:17:05,180
Yeah.

4573
02:17:05,180 --> 02:17:06,220
It's so early in the day.

4574
02:17:06,220 --> 02:17:06,480
Yeah.

4575
02:17:06,500 --> 02:17:07,320
Guys.

4576
02:17:07,500 --> 02:17:07,960
Guys.

4577
02:17:07,960 --> 02:17:08,120
Guys.

4578
02:17:08,180 --> 02:17:09,760
I don't know how to play Valorant.

4579
02:17:09,900 --> 02:17:10,900
Is this Valorant?

4580
02:17:11,340 --> 02:17:12,800
Is this a Valorant thing?

4581
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:13,540
Oh, wow.

4582
02:17:13,540 --> 02:17:15,840
But you can learn now and it's going to be awesome.

4583
02:17:16,440 --> 02:17:16,700
Yeah.

4584
02:17:16,700 --> 02:17:17,620
I'm going to be honest.

4585
02:17:17,720 --> 02:17:20,540
If you've never played Valorant, you're going to get hard farmed.

4586
02:17:21,900 --> 02:17:26,420
But I mean, I ain't going to lie to you, you know, like...

4587
02:17:26,420 --> 02:17:26,880
Wait.

4588
02:17:26,880 --> 02:17:27,720
Then where's the fun?

4589
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,300
How come somebody said it's going to be fun?

4590
02:17:30,440 --> 02:17:31,740
It's the one in the farming?

4591
02:17:32,320 --> 02:17:32,960
It'll be fun.

4592
02:17:32,960 --> 02:17:33,400
It'll be fun.

4593
02:17:33,400 --> 02:17:33,600
I mean, listen.

4594
02:17:33,600 --> 02:17:35,000
It's going to be really fun if you like getting destroyed.

4595
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:35,220
What's up?

4596
02:17:35,360 --> 02:17:35,600
Hey.

4597
02:17:35,600 --> 02:17:35,980
Hey.

4598
02:17:36,020 --> 02:17:36,480
Hey.

4599
02:17:36,600 --> 02:17:36,700
I don't know.

4600
02:17:36,700 --> 02:17:37,820
It's like a thing, you know.

4601
02:17:44,380 --> 02:17:44,800
Oh.

4602
02:17:45,960 --> 02:17:48,120
I just can't quite tell what that angle would be.

4603
02:17:48,260 --> 02:17:48,900
Yeah, me neither.

4604
02:17:49,180 --> 02:17:50,980
Well, I was trying to tell her like...

4605
02:17:50,980 --> 02:17:51,540
Well...

4606
02:17:51,540 --> 02:17:51,700
No.

4607
02:17:51,700 --> 02:17:52,280
Never mind.

4608
02:17:53,440 --> 02:17:53,860
Oh.

4609
02:17:54,160 --> 02:17:57,560
I don't know.

4610
02:17:57,760 --> 02:17:58,440
I don't know.

4611
02:17:58,440 --> 02:17:58,500
Okay.

4612
02:17:58,500 --> 02:17:58,620
Okay.

4613
02:17:58,820 --> 02:17:59,100
Okay.

4614
02:17:59,200 --> 02:18:00,860
I flamed LM enough today.

4615
02:18:01,040 --> 02:18:03,900
How do I get out of that?

4616
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,260
How is it going to fit into that exactly?

4617
02:18:06,320 --> 02:18:07,020
It's where it's going to get up.

4618
02:18:07,060 --> 02:18:07,480
All right.

4619
02:18:08,100 --> 02:18:08,520
So...

4620
02:18:08,520 --> 02:18:09,800
Do you know what peer pressure feels like?

4621
02:18:11,200 --> 02:18:14,040
I will refrain LM, you are late.

4622
02:18:14,220 --> 02:18:14,800
This is peer pressure?

4623
02:18:15,040 --> 02:18:17,420
I will purposely antagonize you until you let it out.

4624
02:18:17,560 --> 02:18:17,900
This is peer pressure?

4625
02:18:17,960 --> 02:18:18,600
That is crazy!

4626
02:18:19,080 --> 02:18:19,960
Do we hear this?

4627
02:18:20,380 --> 02:18:22,800
You can't just say all that and not do it.

4628
02:18:22,800 --> 02:18:23,820
Do we hear him?

4629
02:18:25,820 --> 02:18:27,960
Oh my freaking god.

4630
02:18:27,960 --> 02:18:29,060
I feel like you gotta do it now.

4631
02:18:29,340 --> 02:18:30,200
Vote him out!

4632
02:18:30,720 --> 02:18:34,180
No, cause then he's just gonna spam actually die.

4633
02:18:34,360 --> 02:18:35,260
Die in real life.

4634
02:18:35,260 --> 02:18:37,740
Die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die.

4635
02:18:38,060 --> 02:18:39,440
He's spamming it in the...

4636
02:18:41,860 --> 02:18:42,580
It's crazy.

4637
02:18:43,540 --> 02:18:44,240
That's insane.

4638
02:18:44,920 --> 02:18:45,640
That's crazy!

4639
02:18:46,300 --> 02:18:47,680
Wait, what started this?

4640
02:18:50,300 --> 02:18:50,840
He's crazy.

4641
02:18:53,140 --> 02:18:54,200
Get on the bully.

4642
02:18:54,980 --> 02:18:56,040
Dude, are you kidding me?

4643
02:18:56,080 --> 02:18:57,180
Do you see what he's typing to me?

4644
02:18:57,720 --> 02:18:58,740
Actually, wait, that's kinda true.

4645
02:19:00,100 --> 02:19:01,260
I would never do such a thing.

4646
02:19:01,300 --> 02:19:01,740
It's all a lie.

4647
02:19:01,820 --> 02:19:02,500
It's all photoshopped.

4648
02:19:02,600 --> 02:19:03,540
Wait, so do we have a tenth?

4649
02:19:05,260 --> 02:19:05,520
Dang it.

4650
02:19:07,180 --> 02:19:08,620
Certainly there are a few more.

4651
02:19:08,740 --> 02:19:10,600
I messaged like three or four.

4652
02:19:10,860 --> 02:19:12,120
You say you got one.

4653
02:19:14,060 --> 02:19:14,940
She's always down.

4654
02:19:14,940 --> 02:19:17,100
She's always down, but she's doing something right now.

4655
02:19:17,780 --> 02:19:18,860
Oh, you would.

4656
02:19:19,220 --> 02:19:19,700
You would.

4657
02:19:21,540 --> 02:19:23,120
Okay, I'm copy and pasting.

4658
02:19:23,180 --> 02:19:23,780
I'm copy and pasting.

4659
02:19:25,720 --> 02:19:27,740
Boom, we're gonna be good for one right here.

4660
02:19:27,820 --> 02:19:28,680
The ad here always works.

4661
02:19:28,840 --> 02:19:29,560
Oh my god, I don't know.

4662
02:19:30,720 --> 02:19:31,940
It's just one game.

4663
02:19:32,620 --> 02:19:33,740
Wait, do we only need one?

4664
02:19:33,920 --> 02:19:34,760
Wait, Doki, are you playing?

4665
02:19:35,820 --> 02:19:36,700
Doki, do we have an account?

4666
02:19:36,780 --> 02:19:39,260
Yeah, I have an account, but I don't get farmed.

4667
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:40,880
I don't know.

4668
02:19:42,120 --> 02:19:43,520
Just be on full esteem.

4669
02:19:46,020 --> 02:19:46,820
Doki, go mid.

4670
02:19:46,920 --> 02:19:48,860
Go mid with me every single time, okay?

4671
02:19:49,040 --> 02:19:50,600
Are you just gonna bait me?

4672
02:19:50,740 --> 02:19:51,800
Are you just gonna bait me?

4673
02:19:52,600 --> 02:19:54,800
Just one rule, don't listen to LM.

4674
02:19:55,060 --> 02:19:56,460
Don't listen to him, don't follow him.

4675
02:19:56,620 --> 02:19:58,060
I'll do one game.

4676
02:19:59,800 --> 02:20:00,840
Let's get away from it.

4677
02:20:01,520 --> 02:20:03,440
You might just have the time of your life.

4678
02:20:03,480 --> 02:20:04,160
It might be good for two.

4679
02:20:05,840 --> 02:20:07,500
Two games, Doki, come on.

4680
02:20:07,860 --> 02:20:09,620
Yeah, but then you're gonna be like, three games.

4681
02:20:09,840 --> 02:20:11,220
Come on, Doki, three games.

4682
02:20:11,340 --> 02:20:11,760
That never happens.

4683
02:20:12,240 --> 02:20:13,900
No, no, two is a healthy amount.

4684
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:15,800
You can't just do one.

4685
02:20:16,020 --> 02:20:17,440
Guys, I have to install Valorant.

4686
02:20:21,680 --> 02:20:24,220
You might have to restart your computer.

4687
02:20:24,340 --> 02:20:25,360
I don't know if you want to do that.

4688
02:20:25,560 --> 02:20:27,400
Oh, that's too bad, guys.

4689
02:20:27,840 --> 02:20:29,400
You guys might need to find two.

4690
02:20:30,640 --> 02:20:32,280
You guys might need to find two.

4691
02:20:32,280 --> 02:20:34,040
It's good that we figured this out now, though.

4692
02:20:34,140 --> 02:20:35,060
No, yeah, yeah.

4693
02:20:35,200 --> 02:20:39,080
Next time, you can get me in next time.

4694
02:20:39,180 --> 02:20:40,460
Yeah, yeah, when I have it installed.

4695
02:20:41,440 --> 02:20:42,480
Yeah, gg's, guys.

4696
02:20:42,900 --> 02:20:43,260
Gg's.

4697
02:20:43,680 --> 02:20:44,740
Have a good one.

4698
02:20:45,140 --> 02:20:46,180
Bye, Doki.

4699
02:20:47,920 --> 02:20:48,940
I'm still here already.

4700
02:20:49,620 --> 02:20:50,400
I'm still here.

4701
02:20:52,780 --> 02:20:55,040
Bye, guys.

4702
02:20:55,620 --> 02:20:56,060
Bye.

4703
02:20:58,600 --> 02:21:02,210
I say it because I didn't install.

4704
02:21:03,310 --> 02:21:06,050
I didn't install Valorant.

4705
02:21:06,150 --> 02:21:07,110
Thank God.

4706
02:21:08,690 --> 02:21:10,030
I was so nervous.

4707
02:21:10,150 --> 02:21:12,550
I was like, guys, I don't play Valorant.

4708
02:21:12,630 --> 02:21:14,070
But you guys play Valorant all the time.

4709
02:21:19,650 --> 02:21:22,570
I was nervous because I don't play the game.

4710
02:21:22,710 --> 02:21:23,950
So I was just like, oh my gosh.

4711
02:21:23,970 --> 02:21:24,950
I'm so nervous.

4712
02:21:25,530 --> 02:21:26,950
I'm going to get farmed.

4713
02:21:26,970 --> 02:21:29,350
I get farmed so hard.

4714
02:21:32,210 --> 02:21:33,530
Maybe next time.

4715
02:21:33,570 --> 02:21:36,290
Maybe next time if I'm more warmed up.

4716
02:21:36,290 --> 02:21:39,250
If I'm more like, you know, warmed up for it.

4717
02:21:39,730 --> 02:21:40,250
Wow.

4718
02:21:40,890 --> 02:21:43,470
I just experienced peer pressure.

4719
02:21:44,050 --> 02:21:44,570
Again.

4720
02:21:44,790 --> 02:21:47,730
Because usually Gumi is the one that peer pressures me in Valorant.

4721
02:21:47,930 --> 02:21:50,830
But I experienced group peer pressure today.

4722
02:21:56,090 --> 02:21:57,490
Drez, thank you for the super chat.

4723
02:21:57,570 --> 02:21:58,310
Thank you, thank you.

4724
02:21:58,310 --> 02:21:59,670
That was a close one.

4725
02:21:59,710 --> 02:22:01,730
The classic, I have to install it.

4726
02:22:01,850 --> 02:22:03,910
Thank you for the super chat.

4727
02:22:04,030 --> 02:22:04,830
Thank you, thank you.

4728
02:22:04,930 --> 02:22:06,510
I hope you guys had a lot of fun.

4729
02:22:07,630 --> 02:22:10,050
It was a lot of fun playing with a group of people.

4730
02:22:10,390 --> 02:22:15,510
Like I said, it was my It was like my first time playing with a lot of these people.

4731
02:22:16,290 --> 02:22:20,170
I hope that I didn't spill too much spaghetti today.

4732
02:22:21,210 --> 02:22:26,490
And like people enjoyed watching me on other people's stream.

4733
02:22:26,830 --> 02:22:30,330
I hope you guys enjoyed the stream with all the flesh tubers today.

4734
02:22:30,570 --> 02:22:31,330
It was pretty fun.

4735
02:22:31,910 --> 02:22:37,530
I liked the roleplay aspect of the game in general.

4736
02:22:37,610 --> 02:22:39,450
Because we were pretending to work at the office.

4737
02:22:39,770 --> 02:22:43,970
And all my knowledge about working in the office was just watching the office.

4738
02:22:52,130 --> 02:22:55,630
And I hope you guys had a lot of fun watching.

4739
02:22:55,850 --> 02:22:56,750
It was a lot of fun playing.

4740
02:22:58,310 --> 02:23:02,730
And as always, everybody stay hydrated.

4741
02:23:03,490 --> 02:23:04,290
Posture check.

4742
02:23:04,450 --> 02:23:07,130
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

4743
02:23:07,310 --> 02:23:10,410
And if you stayed up for me, head to bed.

4744
02:23:10,690 --> 02:23:12,650
Because you deserve it.

4745
02:23:12,810 --> 02:23:23,330
Oh yeah, by the way, before I see you guys next time, the sponsor stream for tomorrow is going to be moved to Friday.

4746
02:23:23,610 --> 02:23:30,150
So tomorrow's stream is just going to be a member stream.

4747
02:23:30,390 --> 02:23:38,410
The sponsor stream is I just signed the I just finalized all the details for it.

4748
02:23:38,550 --> 02:23:44,610
So the reason why it was a special stream is because nothing was finalized yet.

4749
02:23:44,630 --> 02:23:46,150
But it got finalized this morning.

4750
02:23:46,410 --> 02:23:50,370
And it is a free to play game called Fast Penguin.

4751
02:23:51,150 --> 02:23:54,710
I did tell you guys I'm taking a lot more sponsors the oncoming week.

4752
02:23:54,710 --> 02:23:58,910
Because I have a lot of bills to pay.

4753
02:24:00,010 --> 02:24:07,050
So I hope you guys are okay with the fact that I'm doing a lot of sponsors this oncoming week.

4754
02:24:09,070 --> 02:24:12,610
So it's actually a free to play Battle Royale racing game.

4755
02:24:12,830 --> 02:24:14,410
So I'll be doing that on Friday.

4756
02:24:15,610 --> 02:24:20,190
And yeah, so that's really all the updates for today.

4757
02:24:20,390 --> 02:24:23,530
I know I wrote update stuff usually on my server.

4758
02:24:24,710 --> 02:24:28,010
I don't think I have any other updates.

4759
02:24:28,070 --> 02:24:32,810
There was something I wanted to give you guys a story time about, but I forgot what the story was.

4760
02:24:33,050 --> 02:24:35,150
I already forgot the story.

4761
02:24:35,490 --> 02:24:39,070
I was like, oh my god, I can't wait to tell chat about the story.

4762
02:24:39,450 --> 02:24:41,590
Oh wait, let me tell you guys about the story.

4763
02:24:42,930 --> 02:24:49,570
Basically I had the most fucking awkward encounter yesterday when I went to grab food downstairs at the lobby.

4764
02:24:49,850 --> 02:25:02,950
I went downstairs at the lobby and then there was like a group of like a group of I guess like an Asian family downstairs and then like you know, there was like mom, a grandma, a grandpa like teenagers or young adults or whatever.

4765
02:25:03,070 --> 02:25:06,950
And then one of the young adults approached me and was like, hey, do you remember me?

4766
02:25:07,450 --> 02:25:11,270
And I was so taken aback because I was like, why are you approaching me?

4767
02:25:11,470 --> 02:25:14,570
I was just like, I'm like, sorry?

4768
02:25:14,790 --> 02:25:17,050
And then he was like, are you a rent owner?

4769
02:25:17,310 --> 02:25:18,250
Are you a renter owner?

4770
02:25:18,550 --> 02:25:19,490
And I was like, rent.

4771
02:25:19,690 --> 02:25:23,910
And then he like walked back to the table and I was like, what?

4772
02:25:24,710 --> 02:25:28,610
I was just like, why the fuck did you approach me?

4773
02:25:28,790 --> 02:25:30,530
Like, who are you?

4774
02:25:30,810 --> 02:25:32,610
He's like, do you, hey, remember me?

4775
02:25:32,770 --> 02:25:33,990
I'm like, obviously not.

4776
02:25:34,930 --> 02:25:36,310
That was so awkward.

4777
02:25:36,710 --> 02:25:39,580
I'm like, I'm just trying to, bro.

4778
02:25:39,780 --> 02:25:40,460
I'm just trying.

4779
02:25:40,720 --> 02:25:42,380
I don't know who you are.

4780
02:25:48,740 --> 02:25:50,440
Anyway guys, that was my story.

4781
02:25:50,540 --> 02:26:12,480
Also, yesterday was so, okay, I was walking, I was walking dad and then when I was walking him, I was over, there was a conversation happening behind me while I was like, walking him and then I heard these two guys, they were like, yeah, they're like,

4782
02:26:12,620 --> 02:26:22,880
one of them, the conversation perked my interest because what I heard was one of them was like, it's so hard to watch movies without shrooms these days.

4783
02:26:23,040 --> 02:26:24,780
And I'm just like, what the?

4784
02:26:24,960 --> 02:26:30,980
And then the other guy, the other guy was like, oh, you should watch Super Mario.

4785
02:26:31,220 --> 02:26:32,540
It's so good with shrooms.

4786
02:26:32,820 --> 02:26:33,560
And I'm like,

4787
02:26:39,070 --> 02:26:41,690
I was just like, what?

4788
02:26:48,360 --> 02:26:53,000
I was just like, what the fuck is, what is this conversation?

4789
02:26:54,280 --> 02:26:59,600
