1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:03,560
Oh,

2
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,690
hello everybody!

3
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,330
Hello, hello!

4
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:53,450
Welcome back!

5
00:01:53,970 --> 00:02:00,250
Oh my gosh, uh, I like passed out so fast after...

6
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:07,750
Well, not after the sponsor stream yesterday, but like after I ate dinner... did I eat... yeah, after I ate... I was like, did I eat dinner?

7
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:08,750
Yes, after I ate dinner.

8
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:16,690
After I ate dinner, um, I like, I was like, I'm gonna take a nap.

9
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:17,530
I'm tired.

10
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,890
I'm, I'm, I'm gonna take a nap.

11
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:20,850
I'm gonna set up an alarm.

12
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:31,950
I, I need you guys to know, I, I snoozed on my, on my phone alarm ten times, I think.

13
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,530
It felt like ten times.

14
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,730
To the point where I...

15
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:51,690
I think, um, I vaguely remember this, but like, um, one of my parents went into my room and like, just took my phone and shut it off.

16
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:52,290
Like...

17
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:03,270
Because, because, you know, every, every ten to fifteen minutes, it just kept, you know, ringing.

18
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:08,730
The alarm just kept ringing, cause I keep snoozing, cause I couldn't wake, I couldn't properly wake up.

19
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:20,850
So then like, one of my parents just went into my room, they had it, and they went into my room and finally shut my alarm off so that I would never snooze again.

20
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:27,320
I was so tired.

21
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,120
I'm still tired.

22
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,720
Oh my god.

23
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:38,760
Um, needless to say, uh, I'm gonna be taking two rest days in a row.

24
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,680
So Sunday and Monday, I'm out.

25
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm out.

26
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,940
Um, let me, I need to, where's my...

27
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:45,940
Let me open the window.

28
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,680
It always gets like, I think like ever since I got my, uh, new PC, it's like a lot stronger now.

29
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:53,700
Um...

30
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,920
Um, it's a lot stronger now.

31
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:00,060
So like, because of that, it does generate heat more often.

32
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:04,480
It does generate a lot, I feel like it generates a lot more heat now.

33
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,860
So like, because it's like a super buff PC.

34
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,980
But like, um, so now it's like extra stuffy in my room.

35
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,560
So I need to like always open the window.

36
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,560
Give me a sec guys.

37
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,040
I don't, I have to close my window at night because I don't want bugs in my room.

38
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,560
Um, give me a sec.

39
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:20,680
No.

40
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:29,960
Okay.

41
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,440
How I open the window is like, super unconventional.

42
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:39,500
Because like, it's one of those windows where it has two locks.

43
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,600
So the lock, one of the locks is at the top.

44
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,320
Um, so what I do is that I grab the lock.

45
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,220
So I get the bottom lock.

46
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:55,520
And then what I do to get the top lock is that I take the ends of the blinds.

47
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,480
And then I just like, I use it to poke the...

48
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,560
I take the ends of the blinds.

49
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,940
And then I pull it up and just use it as like a pointer stick.

50
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,980
And just to unlock the lock.

51
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:15,220
And that's how I do it because I'm not tall enough.

52
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,280
It's a really tall lock.

53
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,320
It's really tall.

54
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,700
Um, but yeah, that's how I do it.

55
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,060
Okay guys, I might actually need coffee.

56
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:25,920
Give me a second.

57
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,660
I was like, I'm like, oh no, this game.

58
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,760
Somebody was like, you should not be playing this game while tired.

59
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,300
And I was like, oh shit, you're right.

60
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,280
This game is actually hard.

61
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,500
Give me a sec.

62
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,560
I will grab coffee real quick.

63
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:51,430
Alright.

64
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,990
I've got my canned coffee.

65
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:55,250
My...

66
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,410
I'm a canned coffee connoisseur.

67
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,010
Oh my gosh.

68
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:01,390
Okay, sorry.

69
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,510
I thought I put my headphone.

70
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,470
Oh my gosh, why is my headphone so...

71
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,230
Oh no, did I accidentally...

72
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:11,660
I broke my headphone in the middle.

73
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:13,420
Okay.

74
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,620
Give me a sec.

75
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,300
Alright, it's sort of...

76
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,100
It's not fixed.

77
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,020
Oh no.

78
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,860
I got to buy new headphones.

79
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,140
I'm a mess right now.

80
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,320
I don't know

81
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,840
what headphones this is.

82
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,440
Oh, I'm a mess.

83
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,460
I can't even open my canned coffee.

84
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,020
Give me...

85
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,760
Okay, now I open it.

86
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,220
Okay.

87
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,600
You can hear the strength.

88
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,680
I'm strong as fuck.

89
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,200
Okay.

90
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,140
I open it.

91
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,760
I'm going to have to order new headphones after this stream.

92
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,460
I just started and I'm a mess.

93
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,880
Oh my god.

94
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,660
Holy shit.

95
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,280
So, uh, but yeah, it has been a lot.

96
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,820
It's been a lot.

97
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,180
Thank you Super Chat.

98
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:07,480
Thank you.

99
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,440
Thank you, My Solutions having an alarm volume so loud, I almost get panic attacks when waking up.

100
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,220
That's the thing.

101
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,860
I do have a very loud alarm.

102
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:21,980
It's a classic like So, that's a sad alarm.

103
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:26,060
But, like, I've been using that alarm for my whole life.

104
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,920
Like, ever since I got an iPhone?

105
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,860
Um, that like my body can just be, you know?

106
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,000
...has trained itself to like, uh...

107
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,260
...to like... what's the word?

108
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,920
...that I got used to it.

109
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,160
Like, it's not... I'm so fucked on a real fire alarm.

110
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,160
I... I once slept through a fire alarm.

111
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,020
It's that bad!

112
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,860
I... I once slept through a fire alarm.

113
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,120
Luckily, it was like a drill, a practice fire alarm.

114
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,320
Like, it wasn't a real fire alarm.

115
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:04,840
Cause I be really fucked cause I live in a very, very... I live on like, the higher floors...

116
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,380
...um... at my apartment.

117
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,300
So like, I be very, very fucked.

118
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:09,880
...

119
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:10,860
...

120
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,780
I... I...

121
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:17,520
Okay, not gonna lie, I'm gonna say, I don't understand.

122
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,100
I don't know if this is like, an Asian thing.

123
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,960
But like, I actually... I honestly... I... I don't underst...

124
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,620
Oh, so my... I don't know why, every time like, I start stream...

125
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,140
...um... my chat dies.

126
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,300
I don't know if it's like, an OBS thing or whatever.

127
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,620
Uh... but it's been like...

128
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:36,560
Like, if I like, swap from this scene, my chat just disappears.

129
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,400
And I don't know if it's like, an OBS...

130
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,380
Um... an OBS bug or whatever.

131
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,080
But it's happening a lot frequently.

132
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,680
Um... but... um...

133
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,760
Wait, where was I on topic?

134
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:48,440
Uh...

135
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,840
Oh yeah, okay, I don't know if it's an Asian thing.

136
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,780
But like... um...

137
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,360
Like... I... like...

138
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,160
I always... like, I... I... Everytime...

139
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,520
We like... you know, like...

140
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,120
...um... my parents are like...

141
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,440
We like, move somewhere.

142
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:11,680
Or like, for hotels and stuff, They're always like, Oh, we gotta get the highest floors.

143
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,700
Because the higher the floor you are, the more important you are.

144
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,700
Or, like the more...

145
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,480
like the better the room is, the better the place is.

146
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,280
But like... I... I don't underst..

147
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,720
...the reason why.

148
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,440
Like... I don't... I don't... I don't...

149
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,140
I don't understand the reasoning.

150
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:34,220
I'd rather it be like... is it less noise?

151
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,540
Is that it?

152
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,120
Higher is better.

153
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,820
I guess it's like less bug.

154
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,280
Is that really... is it like less bugs or what?

155
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,180
I don't understand.

156
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,580
Closer... I like something... it's closer to heaven.

157
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,880
I don't understand... I don't understand.

158
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,580
Cause i rather be closer to the floor.

159
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:15,500
Because um... I feel... it's just... I don't know... If there's a fire alarm, I don't have to walk down so many stairs.

160
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:20,560
Like...方." Oh, less noise from the streets?

161
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,380
I guess so.

162
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,400
I guess that makes sense.

163
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,340
I couldn't understand it at first.

164
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,540
But I think...

165
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:31,480
It's good that you guys are smarter than me because I would be fine living closer to the ground.

166
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,520
Like, I don't really care too much about...

167
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:44,080
I guess like... I'm so used to living in apartments that's like at higher floors.

168
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:50,000
That like I didn't realize it also potentially means less bugs.

169
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,320
Which is a good thing because I have my windows open.

170
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,140
And like bugs that made it to my floor, like they deserve to be in here.

171
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,840
Because like I live really... I live like really high up.

172
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:05,280
So if they manage to fly all the way up here, then like good for them.

173
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:05,980
You know what?

174
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:06,680
They made it.

175
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,140
They made it.

176
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,140
It's like a pilgrimage.

177
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,260
They finally made it.

178
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,840
They won only...

179
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,840
Yeah, they won only up.

180
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,540
They deserve to be here.

181
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,660
Lusagi, thank you for the super chat.

182
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,220
Thank you, thank you.

183
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,300
Oh my god, it's your first super chat too!

184
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,540
Thank you!

185
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,820
Also, I'm sorry I didn't read super chats yesterday during the sponsor stream.

186
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,200
I got so absorbed into Neopets that like...

187
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,860
I forgot all about like reading the super chats.

188
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,480
I'm so sorry.

189
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,700
There were so many first time super chatters too.

190
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,200
But thank you so much for the super chat, Lusagi.

191
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,240
Thank you, thank you.

192
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,960
Towards your new headphones!

193
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,600
So happy to be here for Digimon.

194
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,100
Who's your favorite Digimon?

195
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,460
Oh, I talked about it, but it's Betsumon.

196
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,700
If you're talking about joke Digimon, it's Betsumon.

197
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:07,300
But like if you're talking about actual my favorite Digimon, I would say it's like...

198
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,280
It's Gatomon.

199
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:12,840
All the Digimon in... all the Digimon starters for Tamers.

200
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,400
Because they're all peak.

201
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,080
I think Digimon Tamers had all the peak Digimon designs.

202
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,490
And I like...

203
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,700
And I think Patamon is ugly.

204
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:32,000
Everyone was always saying like, oh, Patamon is like the mascot Digimon.

205
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,660
Just like how Pikachu is the mascot Pokemon.

206
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,860
But I'm like, why Patamon?

207
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,520
He's so fucking ugly!

208
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,380
I don't understand!

209
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,980
He's not cute at all!

210
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,520
I think he's just a...

211
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,960
If you take away his wings, he's just a giant potato with legs.

212
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,640
He's like a giant thumb with legs, if you think about it.

213
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:02,800
Like you just... if you take your thumb out and you put wings on it, that's Patamon.

214
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:03,760
That's...

215
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,900
No, people would say that Patamon...

216
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:11,380
You guys were like, no, the mascot is Agumon.

217
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:18,360
No, back then... back then, everybody would say like Patamon is like the cute mascot for Digimon back then.

218
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,460
And they would make like so much merch for it.

219
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:25,420
Because like, Patamon is like... was like a lot easier to like merchandise.

220
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,440
Which I understand, because it's literally a thumb with wings.

221
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,720
But like, back then it was Patamon.

222
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,160
Where they kept like pushing Patamon everywhere.

223
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,120
Now it's Agumon.

224
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:43,900
Because like now they're like, oh, Agumon was actual... the actual like main mascot for Digimon.

225
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,680
But even then, like...

226
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,340
They would make so much merch for it.

227
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,400
I would have liked to have Patamon back then.

228
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,840
Because they're like, Patamon is the main character.

229
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,200
They would push Patamon everywhere in NA.

230
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,720
And I thought he was like the ugliest... one of the ugliest Digimon in the franchise.

231
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,900
Don't... don't...

232
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,180
You just hate me because I'm right.

233
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:15,560
You just... it's exactly... it's a... it's a bean with wings.

234
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,620
It's a giant thumb with wings.

235
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,060
It's not even cute.

236
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,300
It's not even...

237
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,520
They booed her because she's right.

238
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,480
There were so many more cuter Digimon than Patamon.

239
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,400
Okay, Digimon...

240
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,760
Season 1.

241
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,300
Like...

242
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,540
Okay, I have to admit though, like...

243
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:44,100
Oh my god, her... Patamon is so fucking ugly compared to everybody else.

244
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:44,840
Like...

245
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,980
I'm just... I'm just looking at... I'm looking at like...

246
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,660
The Digimon...

247
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:57,340
The Digimon variants in Season 1.

248
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,400
I mean, look at this!

249
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,520
Alright!

250
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,860
Compared to every other Digimon there for the DigiDestined.

251
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,900
Like, look at all the Digimon for the DigiDestined.

252
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,480
Like... Okay, Agumon, I would admit, it's not like everybody's favorite.

253
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,460
Because like, even though he's like a dino...

254
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:13,920
Um...

255
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,920
He's like a very...

256
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,740
He has like a...

257
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,440
The chest of a human...

258
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,280
Like a...

259
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,580
A chest of a human.

260
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,020
So like, I can understand where people are like...

261
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,360
Um... Agumon is like not their thing.

262
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,140
Because... Honestly, for me, it was also bad to me too.

263
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,880
I never liked Agumon.

264
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,980
Because like, his chest is literally like...

265
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,860
Uh...

266
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,120
Like that of like...

267
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,300
Um...

268
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:40,700
Um...

269
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,900
Of like a person that might have like let themselves go a little bit.

270
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,620
Uh...

271
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,240
Yeah, he's got the...

272
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,660
He's got the dad bod.

273
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,280
I would admit, he's got the dad bod.

274
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,460
And...

275
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:57,040
So like, I wasn't like a huge fan of Agumon.

276
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,120
Um...

277
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:58,700
So...

278
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,540
I wasn't... Okay, I wouldn't say I didn't like Agumon.

279
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,960
Like, I have...

280
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,640
I was just like indifferent to Agumon.

281
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,260
I hated Patamon because they kept pushing Patamon...

282
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,900
As like the main cute man.

283
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,000
As like the mascot of Digimon.

284
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,700
And I hated his design.

285
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,840
Because I thought like Patamon's design was like so ugly.

286
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,680
And I still do.

287
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:22,320
Um...

288
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,340
Like, Patamon plushies aren't even cute.

289
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,560
Like...

290
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,160
I...

291
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:26,400
It...

292
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:26,740
Okay.

293
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,320
Official Patamon plushie is not even cute.

294
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:30,960
Like I...

295
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,700
Like, okay.

296
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,740
This is like what they sold back then.

297
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,860
For like...

298
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,520
Um...

299
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,720
They were like selling...

300
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,580
Like, you know...

301
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,000
Like...

302
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It's very hard to get Digimon merch.

303
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:42,600
I'll just say.

304
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,660
I remember like back then.

305
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,840
It was so difficult to get Digimon merch in the West.

306
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,520
Because like Digimon was not popular at all.

307
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:49,980
And...

308
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:50,560
Like...

309
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,240
It was popular but not as popular as Pokemon.

310
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,360
Because like...

311
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:55,720
You know...

312
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,080
Pokemon was here first.

313
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:57,860
In...

314
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,160
Um...

315
00:16:59,160 --> 00:16:59,800
In the West.

316
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:00,640
Um...

317
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,120
Even though I would say the anime series is so much better.

318
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,000
Versus...

319
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,560
Uh...

320
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,000
Versus Pokemon.

321
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:07,900
Um...

322
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,980
And I feel like they just didn't have like a lot of good games.

323
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:11,540
They just...

324
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:17,420
The biggest downside for Digimon in the West is that they didn't have a lot of good games.

325
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,020
But like...

326
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,700
Look at this ugly fucker.

327
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,100
They still don't...

328
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,560
It's really difficult to make Digimon games.

329
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:30,980
But like...

330
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:31,580
Um...

331
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,320
Like...

332
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:32,980
Oh my god.

333
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,040
He's so ugly.

334
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,540
Like...

335
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:40,730
I just never liked how he looked.

336
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:41,570
I...

337
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:45,260
But he...

338
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:45,500
He's so cute.

339
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:45,800
He's so cute.

340
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:45,880
You're...

341
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,700
Okay.

342
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,340
Like...

343
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,040
But like...

344
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,000
You're...

345
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,380
You're just mad because you...

346
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,960
You know there's like better...

347
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,560
Like Terriormon...

348
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,520
It should've...

349
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,320
Terriormon...

350
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,500
I bet you like...

351
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,200
Um...

352
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,520
If Terriormon was in Season 1...

353
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,040
Like...

354
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:02,880
He would be the...

355
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,620
He would've beaten Pikachu.

356
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:11,660
Terriormon would've 100% beaten Pikachu if he was created in Season 1.

357
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,420
Like...

358
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,480
He has everything.

359
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,220
Everything that Pikachu wishes!

360
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,600
They made Pikachu...

361
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:30,300
Pikachu used to be a fat fuck and then like he got skinnier and skinnier into like Terrarium on bods like

362
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:39,360
Okay, Pikachu fat Pikachu, okay, there you go like Okay, let's see.

363
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,780
I mean there's like the evolution like look at him.

364
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:48,220
This is like Terrarium on had that body before Pikachu became skinny

365
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,560
This is literally Terriormon!

366
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,780
Are your eyes okay?

367
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,880
Bad Pikachu, my boy.

368
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,080
Alright, Terrier... okay, Digimon Tamers.

369
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,840
When did Digimon Tamers come out?

370
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,480
Digimon Tamers came out in 2001!

371
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,480
Skinny Pikachu was 2010!

372
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,740
You guys are like, but I used to love Fat Pikachu.

373
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,300
Yeah, but it was... oh my gosh, okay.

374
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,800
Um, wait...

375
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,240
Pikachu... okay, the reason... I feel like one of the reasons why...

376
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,360
Oh my god, okay...

377
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,540
I looked up... I looked up...

378
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:04,280
I looked up Fat Pikachu plush and I got this.

379
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,400
I'm sorry, I should be playing the game, but like...

380
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,900
I'm a little bit too absorbed right now.

381
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,380
And... and... and...

382
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,720
Pikachu versus Terriormon.

383
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,220
But look at... look at...

384
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,020
Look at this absolute unit, though.

385
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,680
This is unrelated to my conversation, but like, I really want...

386
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,540
I really want this...

387
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,180
I really want this...

388
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:27,360
I really want this...

389
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,280
I really want this...

390
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,860
I want this... what the fuck?

391
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,840
Can I buy this?

392
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,520
Where can I buy one of these Fat Pikachu plushies?

393
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,000
Wait, I wanna buy one too!

394
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,360
Oh my god!

395
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,160
No!

396
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,340
They don't scum!

397
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:44,460
No!

398
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:44,460
They don't scum!

399
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,900
I want the Mochi Pikachu plushie!

400
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,460
No!

401
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,120
They don't sell these guys any!

402
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,300
I should want this!

403
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,140
Wait, what the fuck?

404
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:53,820
This is amazing!

405
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,720
I want this!

406
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,400
That's Pikachu...

407
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,020
That's the strongest Pikachu!

408
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,940
Oh my god!

409
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,540
I love this plushie!

410
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,260
I...

411
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,300
Okay, anyway...

412
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,460
Sorry, I got it.

413
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,600
I got a little off topic before.

414
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,980
But like, I feel like one of the main reasons why Pikachu got like...

415
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:27,120
the proportions of Pikachu changed was because the plushies just didn't look cute at all.

416
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:38,100
I thought they looked cute, but like, I guess when you compare to like, current Pikachu plushies versus like, Pikachu plushies now, um, like they're just like...

417
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,440
It's harder to make older Pikachu plushies because of the proportions.

418
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,360
It's not marketable enough because of the proportions.

419
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,700
It's like, it's like a version size for plushies, and like, it feels like it's harder to make.

420
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,120
But I used to own this.

421
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,800
I was trying to find this plushie.

422
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,240
I was trying to find this guy!

423
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,260
Um...

424
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:57,560
And...

425
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,100
And like, this is the one I...

426
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,400
I actually owned this plushie.

427
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,820
I used to own this as a little kid.

428
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,660
I remember because I like, loved this plushie so much.

429
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,620
Back then.

430
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,620
That's what I'm saying!

431
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,740
Digimon back then didn't have like, a lot of merch too.

432
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:16,060
It didn't have like, as much merch as Pokemon, which was really sad.

433
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,060
Um...

434
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,260
But yeah, anyway, um...

435
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:29,740
Anyway, if Terriomon existed back when Pikachu was like, the main contender, Terriomon would have won, like 100%.

436
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,620
Like, look at him!

437
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,440
He's so cute and his floppy ears!

438
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:39,860
And like, I honestly, like Terriomon would beat the shit out of Pikachu because he digivolves into something with guns.

439
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:40,220
I don't know.

440
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:49,780
For those who are not familiar, with Digimon, how they do uh, evolution compared to Pokemon is that the stronger they are, the more guns they get.

441
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,360
Like...

442
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,140
For those who...

443
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,660
Okay, Gargomon.

444
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,100
Yeah, he I forgot his evolution.

445
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,980
Um, oh yeah, and he has pants too.

446
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:07,680
I would admit Gargomon is not pretty, is not as pretty as Terriomon.

447
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,140
Um...

448
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,080
Anyway...

449
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:14,260
Like, I mean, he has guns for hands.

450
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:14,880
Like...

451
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,640
For those who...

452
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:19,920
Uh...

453
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:29,500
For those who like, uh, don't understand like Digimon digivolution, um, basically like, in order...

454
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:34,100
The stronger they get, um, the more guns they have.

455
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:40,200
Because I'm pretty sure like after Gargomon, he digivolves into like some guy with like missiles.

456
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,360
Oh yeah, there you go!

457
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:44,500
Mech... Okay, and then he turns into a mecha.

458
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:45,620
Rapidmon.

459
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,080
Um, this is like his his next evolution.

460
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,200
Or, uh, digivolution.

461
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,840
Uh, which is basically, uh...

462
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,740
Basically like missiles.

463
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,560
So, this is how they're... I know.

464
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:04,480
Okay, I would admit, like, for those who are like, oh, he's not as cute when they get older.

465
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,340
Um...

466
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,800
I could understand that.

467
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:13,390
But like...

468
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:15,610
But they have guns!

469
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:19,530
They have... They have guns and missiles!

470
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:20,810
Oh...

471
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:28,630
Look, they have missiles and guns.

472
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:29,610
That's all that matters.

473
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:32,790
Uh... Um, Envy, thank you for the super chat.

474
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:33,510
Thank you, thank you.

475
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,690
Teramon also has the Six Sister Unit.

476
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:38,430
Lopoma, who turns into an... Oh yeah, I know about Lopoma.

477
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:41,490
I don't like Lopoma because I don't like her color scheme.

478
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:54,810
I think like, um... I prefer I... I prefer Teramon over Lopoma because like, I feel like Teramon's color scheme is a lot cuter than Lopoma's color scheme.

479
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:55,950
Um...

480
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:01,550
So I... I personally prefer... I personally prefer Teramon more.

481
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:04,670
Also, I think Lopoma just has too, too many horns.

482
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:08,110
Because Lopoma has three horns and I'm like, that's too many horns.

483
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:10,010
Like, what the fuck are you doing with all those horns?

484
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:10,830
Like...

485
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:11,850
.

486
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:16,530
.

487
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:17,450
It turns into a...

488
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:24,070
Okay, but before it turns into a cool demon, it turns into a... Like, I don't want to say it but, like...

489
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:24,810
.

490
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:28,530
You know, before the...

491
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:31,150
Before the demon, um...

492
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:36,190
Digivolution, it turns into like... like a very ugly one.

493
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:38,710
And then it turns into a cooler...

494
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:39,030
.

495
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,690
Cooler, don't you...

496
00:25:46,690 --> 00:26:02,450
Anyway, yeah, I'm talking about when... Okay, so before it turns into like the cooler demon, it turns into WendyGomon, which is like, in my opinion, like, not really... not that pretty.

497
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,770
Not that pretty.

498
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:05,010
Not that pretty.

499
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:10,170
But it's after that.

500
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:13,930
After that, he turns into a more handsome Digimon.

501
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:17,090
Alright, let me... Sorry, I got like so off topic.

502
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,010
I'm sorry.

503
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:27,610
I get like... When I get passionate about stuff, I tend to like... I get way too passionate.

504
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:34,250
Alright, the reason why I didn't have the game booted up is that the game starts playing a opening.

505
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:37,310
So, that's why I didn't have it opened.

506
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:38,610
Because I want you guys to watch the opening.

507
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,530
I didn't even watch the opening yet too?

508
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,540
All right, here we go.

509
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,420
Ooo, it's made in Unity!

510
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:35,850
Oh no.

511
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,620
It's copyrighted.

512
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,240
Oh no!

513
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,540
They're gonna get five cents off of this meme.

514
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:48,760
XD

515
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,440
Oh no, what are they gonna do?

516
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,000
Tell my company?

517
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,160
You mean the company that I own?

518
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,340
Oh, it crashed.

519
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,260
What the fuck?

520
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,060
Okay.

521
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,980
No, they got me!

522
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,780
They got me!

523
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:21,000
They got me, guys!

524
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,900
They didn't keep Bruce caught.

525
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,040
I got live caught.

526
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:27,840
No!

527
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:32,080
Oh no, I have to listen to the music again.

528
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,640
Oh no!

529
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,620
John Digimon!

530
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,160
Please!

531
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,360
They hit me live.

532
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,360
It would be funny if it crashes at that exact moment too.

533
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:06,310
It's a good song though.

534
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:10,730
Watch it crash again.

535
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:17,010
Alright, for those who don't know, sorry, I never explained the game.

536
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:21,210
But Digimon World Next Order is like the spiritual sequel.

537
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,730
I don't know if it's a sequel to the game.

538
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:27,210
I would say like spiritual sequel to the original Digimon World.

539
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:36,610
And Digimon World was like the very first PS1 game I've ever played.

540
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:37,950
But it was in Japanese.

541
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:42,170
So I didn't know what I was playing.

542
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:43,970
Like I didn't know what was going on.

543
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:46,470
But like I love the shit out of it.

544
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:48,590
Like it was like one of my favorite PS1 games.

545
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,510
Oh, is it sequel?

546
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:50,890
Sequel?

547
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:51,950
Full on sequel?

548
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:56,910
I feel like the only sequel part is that it's like the mechanics are like...

549
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:59,930
Are basically the same.

550
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:05,410
But like it doesn't build off of the original world from what I heard.

551
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:09,430
And they tend to not...

552
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,830
Nowadays they do JRPGs.

553
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:15,010
But back in the day they experimented a lot with Digimon games.

554
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:16,290
Digimon World!

555
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:16,910
Next Order!

556
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:21,590
They like... Digimon... Okay.

557
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:26,210
The reason why Pokemon is also more popular than Digimon is that they had a formula.

558
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:28,670
And they stuck it the entire...

559
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:29,670
Like...

560
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:31,690
The entire time they existed.

561
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:33,930
They found the most successful formula.

562
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,390
But Digimon...

563
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:37,550
Digimon had like the weirdest history.

564
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:41,710
Because it started off as like the male equivalent...

565
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,810
Male version of Tamagotchis.

566
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:46,970
Because Tamagotchis was really popular females.

567
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:48,470
And then they were like...

568
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,570
Well, we want males to...

569
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:50,150
We want guys...

570
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:53,190
Like little boys to play Tamagotchi like games too.

571
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:54,690
So they made Digimon.

572
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:56,190
And that's why they have more guns.

573
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,690
Because they're like...

574
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:58,690
What do boys like?

575
00:30:58,850 --> 00:30:59,270
Oh yes.

576
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:00,390
Violence and guns.

577
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:01,330
Let's just add...

578
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:04,770
Let's add...

579
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:06,030
Let's give them guns!

580
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:10,430
Let's get these Tamagotchi pets guns!

581
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,950
That's what the little boys like.

582
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:21,270
That's sort of why the designs...

583
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,690
Because they're like...

584
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:22,770
Oh!

585
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:25,950
In Pokemon, people love Charmander.

586
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:38,050
So that's why the designs tend to have lots of guns and missiles and tanks and dragons and dinosaurs.

587
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:39,090
Because they're like...

588
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:41,190
What do the little boys like back then?

589
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:41,750
Oh yes.

590
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:43,670
Dinosaurs and guns.

591
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:46,990
So then they combined the two together and made Digimon.

592
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:48,170
Anyway...

593
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:49,930
Anyway...

594
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:50,470
Anyway...

595
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:50,590
Anyway...

596
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:52,070
After that, they were like...

597
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:54,850
What should the next series be when it comes to gaming?

598
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,750
And so they went with like...

599
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:57,290
Oh let's...

600
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,270
Let's give like...

601
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:58,610
I think...

602
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:00,330
Is Digimon World the first...

603
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:02,690
The next game they made for the console?

604
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:03,610
Next gen console?

605
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,750
So like then they went with Digimon World.

606
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,630
And that was also like...

607
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:08,830
Like you know...

608
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:11,210
It was like pet raising and fighting other Digimon.

609
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,030
But they die.

610
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:12,710
Okay.

611
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:13,310
I need...

612
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:14,230
I need to let you guys now know.

613
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,530
Digimon die in this game.

614
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:19,790
And they don't come back.

615
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:20,570
They're gone forever.

616
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:21,850
So...

617
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:25,570
I'm gonna make name all my Digimon after dragoons.

618
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:26,510
So...

619
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:30,950
Anyway...

620
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,210
The stakes are...

621
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:33,770
Are very high here.

622
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:36,170
And...

623
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:37,830
And then Digimon World 2.

624
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:38,370
Oh yeah.

625
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:39,770
And then Digimon World 2.

626
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,730
They made it a dungeon crawler.

627
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:43,650
So they went away from the original game.

628
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:48,530
And then they made it into a dungeon crawler.

629
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:49,890
I own Digimon World 2.

630
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:50,770
And I was like...

631
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:52,510
I thought it was gonna be like Digimon World 1.

632
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,770
And then so when I bought Digimon World 2.

633
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:56,230
I was very disappointed.

634
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:57,750
I was very...

635
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:58,270
I...

636
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,130
I remembered.

637
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:01,530
I remembered as a...

638
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:02,390
As a kid.

639
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,030
I was so excited.

640
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:05,310
It was the one...

641
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:05,510
Wait.

642
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,010
The character was like...

643
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:09,170
A Digimon with a sword in his mouth.

644
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:09,410
Right?

645
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:10,090
I don't remember.

646
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:13,070
They made a new Digimon just for Digimon World 2.

647
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:13,630
And then they made a new Digimon...

648
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:15,430
And I was so sad.

649
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:16,670
Because...

650
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:18,010
I was so sad.

651
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:19,050
Because I was like...

652
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,230
I love Digimon World 1.

653
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:21,730
Even though I didn't really know how to play it.

654
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:22,670
Because it was all in Japanese.

655
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,170
But I really enjoyed the game.

656
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:25,190
And...

657
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:26,750
But then so when I got Digimon World 2.

658
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:27,570
And it was in English.

659
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,210
I was so happy.

660
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:32,710
I was so...

661
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,030
I was so happy.

662
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:35,170
Because...

663
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:36,250
Oh it wasn't the sword.

664
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,710
Was it not the sword Digimon?

665
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:38,410
That was 4?

666
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:39,130
Okay.

667
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:40,390
I need to look up Digimon World 2.

668
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:41,190
Now I'm like...

669
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:43,390
I'm like getting my Digimons confused.

670
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:43,610
I'm like...

671
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:44,030
Okay.

672
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,950
Because every Digimon World...

673
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:47,670
Oh no it wasn't Digimon 2.

674
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:49,630
It was 4.

675
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:50,590
Yeah.

676
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:51,010
4.

677
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:51,750
Yeah.

678
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:54,190
Digimon World 4 was so weird.

679
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:56,050
Because they had swords.

680
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,150
Wait.

681
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:57,650
Okay.

682
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:58,410
All right.

683
00:33:58,450 --> 00:33:58,790
Let me.

684
00:33:58,910 --> 00:33:59,450
Let me.

685
00:33:59,530 --> 00:33:59,870
Okay.

686
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:04,990
So every new Digimon World game was so weird.

687
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,730
It was so different.

688
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:07,810
It was...

689
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:09,810
Because I didn't know what to do.

690
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:10,810
And it was like...

691
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:12,310
So that's why I felt like...

692
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:12,690
Okay.

693
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:13,590
So this is the game name.

694
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:18,030
The first game I played, the next Digimon World game I played was 4.

695
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:21,910
But I went from Digimon World 1 to 4.

696
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:24,050
And I was like, what is this?

697
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:27,730
Like, why do they have swords?

698
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:29,990
I was so confused.

699
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:33,810
Like, I didn't know what was going on.

700
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:40,110
I was so confused.

701
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:44,670
But every Digimon World is like different.

702
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:46,710
It's so different.

703
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:50,130
And I remember Digimon World 3.

704
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:56,230
I remember my dad bought me Digimon World 3.

705
00:34:56,450 --> 00:35:00,990
And I had no idea how to play 3.

706
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:03,430
Because 3 was like an RPG.

707
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:05,950
And so I was like, okay.

708
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:09,930
And then I personally bought Digimon World 4.

709
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:12,790
Because I was like, oh my god, Digimon World 4.

710
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:15,710
Maybe this one will be similar.

711
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:19,310
And then Digimon World 4 was like...

712
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:23,290
You run around with swords killing other Digimon.

713
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:25,010
And I'm like, what?

714
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,070
I was like, where are the people?

715
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:34,240
So this is what like...

716
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:36,210
And I had no friends.

717
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:38,430
So, well, I had friends.

718
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:39,930
But they don't play video games.

719
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:42,230
So like, as like, you know...

720
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,050
Like all my...

721
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:45,410
I didn't really have friends that play video games.

722
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,590
So like this was Digimon World 4.

723
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:49,370
And it was so different.

724
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:54,770
It was so different from like the other Digimons I played.

725
00:35:56,470 --> 00:36:02,750
And so like I was like literally the only girl in my class that played video games or consoles.

726
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:05,550
And like I never really hang out with the guys.

727
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,650
Other than like...

728
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:10,350
Oh, and my parents would not let me invite anybody over.

729
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:18,930
So like I don't think like the first time I've ever had people come over to my house was when I was like nine years old, I think.

730
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:21,110
Yeah, nine years old for a class project.

731
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:27,670
And like that was like literally the only time I've ever had like people over my house.

732
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:30,150
Because I was not allowed to have people over my house.

733
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:31,650
So like I had...

734
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:33,270
The first time was when I was nine.

735
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:34,470
It was a class project.

736
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,450
And then we played video games together.

737
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:38,390
And instead of doing our project...

738
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:40,330
I have to say...

739
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:42,930
Instead of doing our class project.

740
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:45,710
So I've always played video games by myself.

741
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:47,910
I've always played...

742
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:53,790
So I had no friends to play Digimon World 4 with me.

743
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:56,310
So I thought it was dog shit.

744
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:58,870
I was like, I don't like this.

745
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:00,370
I can't play this solo.

746
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:03,270
It's not a good solo game.

747
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:06,430
This game was definitely not meant to be played by me.

748
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:06,870
This game was meant to be played by myself.

749
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:09,410
Because I thought it was a bad game.

750
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:11,310
But then I saw people in my chat was like...

751
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:12,130
Oh, I had a great...

752
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:12,870
I had...

753
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:17,070
I had a great time playing with all my friends in Digimon World 4.

754
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:20,990
I was like, I didn't have friends to play this game with.

755
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:23,270
Is that why I thought it was dog shit?

756
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:24,210
Is that...

757
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:30,440
Is that why?

758
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,320
Anyway, as I was saying...

759
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,000
Um, Digimon did not know what its identity was...

760
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,380
when it came to video games.

761
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:44,140
Because every fucking iteration of a Digimon game is so different.

762
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,260
And now they're doing JRPGs.

763
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,580
Because CyberScoop did really, really well.

764
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,060
So like, I...

765
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,380
Okay, I was sad.

766
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:55,740
Because I thought Digimon Survive was supposed to be like a horror game.

767
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,860
Because like, I was like, oh, a Digimon horror game?

768
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,100
Oh my god.

769
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:00,980
I can't...

770
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:01,880
I'm so excited.

771
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:02,720
A Digi...

772
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,880
Oh my god, a Digimon horror game.

773
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,820
And then I found out it was like a visual novel.

774
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:11,860
Because like, the way they like, advertised Survive...

775
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,540
felt like it was...

776
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,040
Um...

777
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,620
Um, the way they advertised Survive at first...

778
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,180
It was like...

779
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:21,500
I felt like it was like a horror, more so like an action...

780
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,320
Not action, but like...

781
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,300
Um, you know what I mean when...

782
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:29,160
Like, not like a visual novel, but more of like gameplay-wise.

783
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,060
That it's not...

784
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:33,400
I didn't realize it was like a visual novel gameplay...

785
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,600
uh, game.

786
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:37,500
And I'm not like a huge fan of like visual novels...

787
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,000
in general.

788
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,520
Because that's a lot of reading.

789
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,460
That's a lot of reading!

790
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:46,080
I know like Cyber Snoop is like really good, but it's a JRPG and I'm not a JRPG player.

791
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,640
So like, it's not my type of genre.

792
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:53,740
Um, so like when they announced Survive, I was so excited because I was like, oh my god.

793
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,520
Like, that's like something they've never really done before.

794
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,300
Like a horror...

795
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,680
Like more so of a horror element.

796
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:03,020
Um, so I was like super hyped up and then I found out it was a visual novel and then I didn't touch it.

797
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:03,600
So...

798
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,100
I was just like...

799
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:05,940
I was just like...

800
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,080
Oh, it's...

801
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,680
It's a visual novel.

802
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:09,580
Guess...

803
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,780
Guess I...

804
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:13,640
Guess I won't be touching that game anymore.

805
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,980
Because I can't...

806
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:22,600
I also heard they released a horror anime based off of Digimon as well.

807
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:23,040
Which was...

808
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,080
I thought it was really interesting.

809
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,360
Um, they...

810
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:25,660
I...

811
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,700
That's why like in the West, it was...

812
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,680
Digimon was not as popular.

813
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:32,940
Um...

814
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,980
It was not as popular as it is versus Pokemon.

815
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:36,960
Um...

816
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:46,680
Just because like they didn't establish an identity early on in Pokemon when they had like such a dominant force in the West in NA.

817
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,400
That like, uh...

818
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,720
They just like took over.

819
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,820
They literally...

820
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,340
Um...

821
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,140
They literally got...

822
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,980
Like it literally got taken over.

823
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:58,980
That was just too late.

824
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:03,960
Like they had such a stronghold in the market when it comes to like, you know, uh...

825
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,240
A little like...

826
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,600
Like monster companions.

827
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:10,040
That was so hard for Digimon to like, um...

828
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,600
Expand more after that.

829
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:16,040
But I still like Digimon more than Pokemon because I personally think that...

830
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:16,920
Their...

831
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,280
Their...

832
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,360
The anime and the designs are a lot better than Pokemon.

833
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,100
Even like the more recent designs.

834
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:26,460
I feel like Digimon is much more creative when it comes to like the more recent iterations.

835
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,660
I do not...

836
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,720
Personally do not like the newer designs of Pokemon.

837
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:36,520
And like I felt like the newer designs for Pokemon is more so markability in terms of merch.

838
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:40,600
Than like what actually looking good to me.

839
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:41,440
I don't know.

840
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,580
This is my personal opinion.

841
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,660
But I feel like...

842
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:44,380
Um...

843
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:44,820
It's...

844
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,800
The designs are not as good as it once was.

845
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,320
Because I feel like the more recent ones...

846
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:50,680
The...

847
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,540
It's so simple.

848
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,620
Like not simple.

849
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,520
But there's just something...

850
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,720
Off of it.

851
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:58,600
About it for me.

852
00:40:58,780 --> 00:40:59,160
Like...

853
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,420
It's just...

854
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,540
There's something...

855
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:05,340
Off.

856
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,760
About the newer Pokemon designs.

857
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,080
Um...

858
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,040
And...

859
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:15,260
Um...

860
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,440
And so like...

861
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:16,880
That's why...

862
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,380
Like even the starters too.

863
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,080
I'm not like a...

864
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,640
I don't really like the newer starters designs lately.

865
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:22,480
Um...

866
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,260
But I feel like Digimon designs...

867
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,220
In my opinion the newer designs...

868
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,600
I do like it a lot more.

869
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:28,220
Um...

870
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,540
Because they're not afraid to do like more...

871
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:31,260
Uh...

872
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,960
Complicated stuff when it...

873
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,800
Complicated more memorable stuff.

874
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,880
Versus like...

875
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,760
Uh...

876
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,500
Pokemon.

877
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:39,880
Um...

878
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,760
Because like...

879
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,600
Some of the designs that Digimon does...

880
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:42,860
Is like...

881
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:43,220
What the f...

882
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:43,980
How do you make that...

883
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,280
Like a marketable plushie?

884
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:45,640
Like...

885
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,340
It looks cool!

886
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,000
It looks cool!

887
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,080
But like...

888
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,920
How do you make that like a fucking plushie?

889
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:52,180
Like...

890
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,040
Yeah...

891
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:57,580
Yeah...

892
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:58,780
Digimon is like...

893
00:41:58,780 --> 00:41:59,760
More experimental...

894
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,860
When it comes to their designs.

895
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:01,440
I...

896
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,440
Heavily agree.

897
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:03,980
Um...

898
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:04,320
Um...

899
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:04,780
Um...

900
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:05,440
So...

901
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,180
I just realized...

902
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,640
I don't want to talk too much to you guys...

903
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:11,800
But I was like...

904
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:11,820
So...

905
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:11,980
Sorry...

906
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:13,600
Sorry...

907
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,760
I was like...

908
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,620
Sorry...

909
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:16,780
I'm sorry...

910
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:16,940
Sorry...

911
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:17,780
I love...

912
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,600
I love Digimon!

913
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,400
Easy for those who just want...

914
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:21,780
Not for...

915
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,340
For those familiar with the world.

916
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:23,900
I'll do easy.

917
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,220
Um...

918
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,320
If I do normal...

919
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:26,800
Guys...

920
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,600
You can't be like...

921
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,420
No, Doki.

922
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,080
Do normal.

923
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:30,520
Don't be a pussy!

924
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:30,740
Let's see!

925
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,560
If I do normal, you guys will die in like less than a day.

926
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:40,260
So, do you guys want to live and survive and live out your life until you're elderly?

927
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:43,900
Or do you want to die the moment you like poop?

928
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:51,120
I am ready to die.

929
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:51,580
Oh!

930
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:53,680
The girl's cute!

931
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:59,200
Oi, Shiki is so much cuter than Takuto.

932
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,060
I think that's his name.

933
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:02,720
Oh!

934
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,320
I don't like the blue thing coming out of his head.

935
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:10,740
Like, I know that's his hair, but I'm not a huge fan of that.

936
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:15,720
I think Shiki's cute.

937
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,480
Please enter the name.

938
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:19,160
Ooh, me.

939
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:20,900
Doki.

940
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,180
The cuter Doki.

941
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:26,440
Oh!

942
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,220
Okay, cute.

943
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:29,940
Okay, is this eight?

944
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,900
One, two, three, four, five...

945
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:35,120
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

946
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:35,940
Okay.

947
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:37,300
Cuter Doki.

948
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:37,600
Okay.

949
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,020
Cute Doki.

950
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:39,700
There you go.

951
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,420
That's eight.

952
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,770
We'll die for the content.

953
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:52,500
Oh, there's DigiDevice.

954
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,120
Oh my god, I got chosen!

955
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,940
I got ch-ch-ch-chosen!

956
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:08,680
I got ch-ch-ch-chosen!

957
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:09,500
I

958
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,220
got ch-ch-ch-ch-chosen!

959
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:35,020
I mean, technically it is an isekai, but like, I basically got transported into the digi world.

960
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:36,780
The digi-digital world.

961
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:38,880
We're gonna become digital champions.

962
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:41,040
Ooh!

963
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:43,820
Hm.

964
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,200
There's something over there.

965
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,380
The chat died?

966
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:50,200
How the fuck did you guys die?

967
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,680
Like, what happened?

968
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:56,100
How did you guys die?

969
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:58,680
Okay, give me a sec, let me fix it.

970
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:00,380
I don't- I don't know.

971
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,060
I actually don't know why it does that.

972
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:10,180
I don't know if it's like the chat CSS, or if it's just something to do with the new OBS.

973
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,360
Don't worry, I fixed you guys.

974
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:14,220
Okay, the volume is low.

975
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:15,300
You know what's funny?

976
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:19,620
It's not letting me go to my settings.

977
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:24,480
Can I- Oh, I cannot- Guys, I literally cannot go to the settings here.

978
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,760
They locked me in!

979
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,960
They locked me in here!

980
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,020
Yeah, I was gonna say, it's not really an isekai.

981
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,400
Because the digital world is part of this world.

982
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,200
Um, it's just the digital world.

983
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,000
We're literally in your computers.

984
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,200
Oh no, he's evil.

985
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:50,780
Machine dream on.

986
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,420
Can I pet it?

987
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:03,430
He's so cool!

988
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:05,390
What the fuck is that guy?

989
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:07,850
Oh my god!

990
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:09,390
Wait, that wasn't you two?

991
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:12,950
Oh yeah, by the way, they can talk.

992
00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:15,990
For those who are not familiar with Digimon, they can talk to us.

993
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:20,330
It's like a grown man in this dog.

994
00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:25,090
What is it?

995
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:29,090
You've always given us commands in battle.

996
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:32,010
Oh, they're my Digimon!

997
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:33,650
You seem really confused, all of us.

998
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:35,430
It can't be helped.

999
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:36,570
We'll back you up.

1000
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:38,550
He's got that dog in him.

1001
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:40,190
You've gotta be kidding me.

1002
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:41,950
You're not supposed to forget us.

1003
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:43,070
You're partners.

1004
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:50,320
Alright, Digimon battles.

1005
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:56,840
In pursuit of victory, your partner Digimon will choose and attack targets of their own accord.

1006
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:01,160
However, teamers can use orders to command them more directly.

1007
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:03,600
Open ordering for partner L.

1008
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:04,460
I had two?

1009
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:05,960
I did multitask?

1010
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:06,560
Multitask?

1011
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:10,380
Okay, I can do this.

1012
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:12,260
Left stick, order.

1013
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:14,620
So you can open the ring...

1014
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:18,740
Okay, I'm glad I had coffee.

1015
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,380
How long you have left to give it before the ring closes?

1016
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,280
The timer stopped when she was ordered, but only for 5 seconds.

1017
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:30,300
The ring closes the timer when she was ordered, and you'll have to wait 5 seconds to open it again.

1018
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:31,320
Try it out!

1019
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:31,800
Okay.

1020
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,280
Order WarGreymon to use the Mach Jab.

1021
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:37,980
RB and tilt left then press A.

1022
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,720
Okay, I need to use the Jab.

1023
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:41,500
There they are.

1024
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,160
Umm... Mach Jab.

1025
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:48,540
Alright.

1026
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,120
Do your thing!

1027
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:52,140
Oh, he did it!

1028
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:55,260
Okay, and then next try use Agitation.

1029
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:56,980
MetalGurumon.

1030
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:57,780
Okay.

1031
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,400
I can do this.

1032
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,400
Alright, Metal...

1033
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:02,020
Where's Metal?

1034
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:03,540
Where is it?

1035
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:05,420
Oh... No!

1036
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,320
I'm sorry MetalGurumon!

1037
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:13,140
Oh, agitated.

1038
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,160
It was right here?

1039
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:17,940
Okay, nice.

1040
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:22,280
We'll let him automatically recover HP for a period of time.

1041
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,680
There are various types of agitation time used as a Digimon.

1042
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,280
Um, and hair abilities.

1043
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:27,760
He added more order power.

1044
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:29,940
For stronger order power, you need...

1045
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,680
Okay, for stronger orders, you need more order power.

1046
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,820
So you'll require your partners to build more order powers.

1047
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:38,220
Press A buttons to support WarGreymon until you've gathered 150.

1048
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:42,680
When a partner attack has hit and after taking damage, that's your chance!

1049
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:47,960
After using support, you will need to wait a bit before using it again.

1050
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:51,780
Okay, is he doing it?

1051
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,240
Is he doing it?

1052
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:54,440
Yeah!

1053
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:55,940
Support!

1054
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:57,080
Go!

1055
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:57,600
Go!

1056
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:57,980
Go!

1057
00:48:58,580 --> 00:48:59,880
I'm cheating them on!

1058
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:02,380
You're getting the hang of it, I am!

1059
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:07,280
I don't know who I am!

1060
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:10,200
Does it look like I know what I'm doing, guys?

1061
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:10,500
Bam!

1062
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:14,220
Woo!

1063
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:19,620
Oh my god, he's doing the thing!

1064
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:21,200
It's the terror force!

1065
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:23,400
I remember that in the anime!

1066
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:27,840
I'm beginning to believe.

1067
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:32,940
I'm so strong!

1068
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:34,360
No good?

1069
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:35,400
No.

1070
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:36,940
I have to keep going.

1071
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,980
I've finally met my tamer.

1072
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,380
This is where I'm a goner?

1073
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:45,720
I finally met you!

1074
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:47,880
Guys, you can't give up!

1075
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,920
You finally met me, guys!

1076
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:51,140
Gotta keep going!

1077
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,120
I see.

1078
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,700
We may be defeated here.

1079
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,860
But we won't let that happen to you!

1080
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,140
Ha!

1081
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:01,640
It happened!

1082
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:03,280
Too cute, Doki!

1083
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:08,520
Do it for Doki!

1084
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,440
Oh my god, we're bonding!

1085
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:16,940
Yeah!

1086
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:25,440
You don't wanna be losers?

1087
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:27,540
You're winners!

1088
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:29,440
Dragons, you're winners!

1089
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,100
You gotta keep going!

1090
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:35,160
Alright.

1091
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,340
LB to open for both.

1092
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,560
Normally, the icon here is for Digifuse skills.

1093
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:43,100
In certain circumstances, EXE will be available.

1094
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,460
At the same time, and tilt then press A.

1095
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:45,920
Okay.

1096
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:47,140
Alright.

1097
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:49,860
Alright, let me out of the ring of destruction.

1098
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:51,220
Okay.

1099
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:52,260
Uh...

1100
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:54,820
Alright, what's this?

1101
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:56,620
Extra cross evolution?

1102
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:57,140
Extra cross evolution?

1103
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:00,720
Am I gonna digivolve?

1104
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:01,660
Are we fusing?

1105
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:02,560
Are we fusing?

1106
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:03,660
The PGM!

1107
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:05,100
Oh!

1108
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:05,880
The PGM!

1109
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:07,620
Uh!

1110
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:09,220
The PGM!

1111
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:09,560
The PGM!

1112
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:09,600
The PGM!

1113
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:09,680
The PGM!

1114
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:10,360
Digimon!

1115
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:11,640
The OGs!

1116
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:11,840
God!

1117
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:12,820
Thank you, Super Chat!

1118
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:13,100
The...

1119
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:14,360
Thank you, Gothamette!

1120
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:21,160
Oh my god, you're fusing!

1121
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:24,040
What are you gonna become?

1122
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:25,120
Oh!

1123
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:26,520
Oh!

1124
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:29,160
Oh that guy!

1125
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,620
I forgot his name.

1126
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,700
Is it Omegamon?

1127
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:34,880
Omegamon!

1128
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,320
His arm... oh shit!

1129
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:48,240
He gets a sword and gun?

1130
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:53,320
Success!

1131
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:58,100
With EXE, your partner Digimon will fuse into extra powerful forms.

1132
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:00,940
After the battle is over, your Digimon will separate again.

1133
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:06,240
Guys, we can't fall in love with this Digimon because he's gonna die.

1134
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:11,840
That's the whole point of this game.

1135
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:19,750
Wait, is he dead?

1136
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:24,090
Wait, did he die?

1137
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:27,130
No, you can't die!

1138
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:29,250
What?!

1139
00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:32,850
We lost?!

1140
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:35,570
We need to be sleepy!

1141
00:52:35,890 --> 00:52:37,890
We must defend our partner!

1142
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:51,900
I love how the cutscene audio is so quiet compared to the game.

1143
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,480
I can't believe it!

1144
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:03,400
Right after they Digi-fused, they fucking just died like that?!

1145
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:17,640
Wait, they won!

1146
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:19,280
Then what was the point of fusing?

1147
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:23,000
What was the point of fusing?

1148
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:28,780
What was the point of fusing if like... they're just better separately?

1149
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:32,100
Some people are just not meant to be together.

1150
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:38,640
Oh yeah, and then when they die, they just devolve.

1151
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:40,940
So now they're a baby.

1152
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:44,280
Yay!

1153
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:49,700
What about you, Dragoons?

1154
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:51,540
Um...

1155
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:52,840
Are you... how old are you guys?

1156
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,860
Are you guys gonna die of old age soon?

1157
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,080
Oh.

1158
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:03,110
Oh, I guess...

1159
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:05,550
I guess they're dead?

1160
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:10,650
Just... just one thing.

1161
00:54:10,930 --> 00:54:11,530
Peace.

1162
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:17,670
Okay, okay.

1163
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:20,550
Oh, oh no, you guys are fine!

1164
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:23,610
It seems like it.

1165
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:24,190
Hmm?

1166
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:25,790
A human?

1167
00:54:26,050 --> 00:54:30,670
A machine Draymond disappears and a human appears.

1168
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:32,470
Fascinating!

1169
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:33,390
Oh, it's him!

1170
00:54:33,730 --> 00:54:34,610
It's Gigi-mon!

1171
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:36,710
This person was in...

1172
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:40,810
This guy was in the first Digimon World game.

1173
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:50,730
You defeated that machine Draymond.

1174
00:54:51,130 --> 00:54:54,810
That must be what destabilized the other dimension.

1175
00:54:55,650 --> 00:54:56,330
Hmm.

1176
00:54:56,330 --> 00:54:59,230
These must be your partners.

1177
00:54:59,270 --> 00:54:59,730
Yeah!

1178
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:02,370
Dragoon 1 and Dragoon 2.

1179
00:55:02,770 --> 00:55:04,750
That's an odd relationship.

1180
00:55:05,450 --> 00:55:06,990
Okay, wait, wait.

1181
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:07,790
What?

1182
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:09,370
I can't have two Digimons?

1183
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:09,950
Like...

1184
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:15,070
If Pokemon can have six, I can have two!

1185
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:19,970
They did everything they could to defend you.

1186
00:55:19,970 --> 00:55:21,170
Don't make it weird.

1187
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:23,090
I'm not making it weird!

1188
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:24,810
He's making it weird!

1189
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:27,830
I'm gonna have three Digimons too!

1190
00:55:28,010 --> 00:55:30,230
That little guy right there is gonna join the squad!

1191
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:34,990
Why did Mom let you have two Digimons?

1192
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:43,150
No need to look so depressed.

1193
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:53,940
They were partner Digimon.

1194
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:58,740
So it is possible to revive them with a Digi-egg.

1195
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:00,580
I have preserved them.

1196
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:01,740
Wait, they just died.

1197
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:02,360
They have them in external storage.

1198
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,580
Wait, did they actually die?

1199
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,440
Oh shit!

1200
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,440
07, that was fast.

1201
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:13,780
Goodbye Dragoon 1 and Dragoon 2.

1202
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:18,520
So, hold your partner in your heart.

1203
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:21,320
Goodbye Dragoon 1 and 2.

1204
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:25,040
That was so fast.

1205
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:26,900
Wait, isn't this Terriormon?

1206
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:28,060
Wait, which one is...

1207
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:29,680
Okay, I want Gatomon.

1208
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,180
I'm trying to remember.

1209
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,680
I'm trying to remember which one was which.

1210
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,240
Digivolution details.

1211
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:37,880
Tsunomon.

1212
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:38,540
Okay.

1213
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:40,980
Which one was this?

1214
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:41,640
Tokomon.

1215
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,060
Rare in training.

1216
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:45,600
It has hands and feet.

1217
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:47,100
It's cute but it has...

1218
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:48,240
Oh, this one is the...

1219
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,080
It's the triangle...

1220
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:51,040
It's the yellow cat, right?

1221
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:52,960
Okay, but like which one...

1222
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:53,560
Which one...

1223
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:54,620
This one is Gatomon.

1224
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:56,160
This one is Gatomon.

1225
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,760
Which one is this one?

1226
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:58,800
I don't remember this one.

1227
00:56:58,800 --> 00:56:59,500
Gummymon?

1228
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,800
That grew from Bright and Cheerful.

1229
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:03,420
It has a high horn.

1230
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,140
Which one was this one?

1231
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:09,460
Is that Terriormon?

1232
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:15,300
That's Terrier?

1233
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:16,520
That's Terriormon?

1234
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:17,680
I'm gonna get Terriormon.

1235
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:18,960
Oh my god, this is so difficult.

1236
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:20,680
I don't know if I should get...

1237
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:24,260
Terriormon or Gatomon.

1238
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:25,660
I'm gonna get Terriormon.

1239
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:26,820
I like Terriormon more.

1240
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:27,360
This is Lopo.

1241
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:28,480
I know this is Lopomon.

1242
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:30,180
And this is...

1243
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:30,900
I'm gonna get...

1244
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:31,740
Oh, it's so difficult.

1245
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:34,320
Okay, when Terriormon dies, I'm gonna get Gatomon later.

1246
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:42,380
Yay!

1247
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,660
Dragon 3 and 4, let's go.

1248
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:52,400
Thank you for the super chat.

1249
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:53,100
Thank you, thank you.

1250
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:53,680
Zerimon!

1251
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:54,800
Oh, I get two.

1252
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:56,920
I can get Gatomon and Terriormon.

1253
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:58,180
Oh my god.

1254
00:57:58,680 --> 00:57:59,500
Dragon 3.

1255
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:04,440
No!

1256
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:04,780
No!

1257
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:08,760
That's okay.

1258
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:10,140
Dragoon 3.

1259
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,240
What are more words?

1260
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:13,440
I can't do...

1261
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:14,040
That's...

1262
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:16,640
How would you know it's one or two more?

1263
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:19,820
Zerimon is not even a real word!

1264
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:21,860
Dragonmon!

1265
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:25,520
Dragoon 2mon!

1266
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:27,140
Nothing!

1267
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:28,420
Nothing...

1268
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:28,880
Nothing...

1269
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:29,500
Nothing...

1270
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:29,720
Nothing...

1271
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:30,300
Nothing...

1272
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:32,880
Nothing...

1273
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:33,220
This is good?

1274
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:41,320
DRAG MON 3 GUN MON 3 Okay.

1275
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:43,660
Oh my god!

1276
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:44,800
It's not fair!

1277
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:51,760
You may- Oh now I can't even enter 8 letters.

1278
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,820
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

1279
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:56,480
That's 7!

1280
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:00,420
What?!

1281
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:00,840
Okay.

1282
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:05,480
DRAG MON 3 What do you mean?!

1283
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:10,420
Wait.

1284
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:14,100
I didn't name him!

1285
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:15,300
I didn't!

1286
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:16,800
Did I- What?

1287
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,160
What happened?!

1288
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:20,560
Wait, what happened?!

1289
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,500
Did I- Wait!

1290
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:23,980
I didn't name him!

1291
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:29,660
Why did I name him?!

1292
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:30,900
Nooooo!

1293
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:34,980
Now he's just default man!

1294
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:39,000
You went bad.

1295
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:40,640
Nooooo!

1296
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:49,920
Okay, we're gonna grab our Gato Mon 2.

1297
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:53,780
Oh, I can rename him later?

1298
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:54,500
Thank god.

1299
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:59,720
Wait, I can't believe GUN is a bad word.

1300
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,420
Did he-

1301
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:09,300
Oh, you gave me a book- Oh, I'm sorry.

1302
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:14,460
They get like- Like 200,000- Oh, I'm sorry.

1303
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:16,840
That is more than 8 letters!

1304
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:23,700
That- This is more than 8 letters!

1305
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:25,320
This is not fair!

1306
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:27,040
That's like 50!

1307
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:31,960
Like, why can you give me a book that's like 50?!

1308
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:32,300
Gato Mon!

1309
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,120
50 letters!

1310
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,460
And I'm restricted to 8!

1311
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,880
I can't believe it!

1312
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:44,040
I can't believe it!

1313
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,960
Okay, drag mon...

1314
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:46,820
Okay, drag mon...

1315
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:47,200
Um...

1316
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:49,580
Drag mon 4.

1317
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:53,140
You may enter- That's not fair!

1318
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:55,980
Drag...

1319
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:58,400
Oh, we used Roman numerals!

1320
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:00,640
Guys, what's in the Roman numeral for 4?

1321
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:01,260
Again.

1322
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:06,240
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...

1323
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:07,280
What's the Roman numeral?

1324
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:09,320
IV, okay.

1325
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:11,140
God damn it!

1326
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:11,300
Okay.

1327
01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:15,440
Dra- Dra-mon IV.

1328
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:16,860
Okay, there you go.

1329
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:19,880
Oh my god, that's our way!

1330
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:21,480
That's how we're gonna do this!

1331
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:24,880
This is a tremendous success!

1332
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:26,500
Roman numerals!

1333
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:26,660
Roman numerals!

1334
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:32,420
Then their rebirths will be complete.

1335
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:34,520
We can't go in the bad way!

1336
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:40,860
Just remember, as their tamer, you have a duty to care for them.

1337
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:42,600
Okay.

1338
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:47,640
Hmm...

1339
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:50,980
You don't seem to understand what's what.

1340
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:54,740
I am just as in the dark as you.

1341
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:58,120
I wonder what is going on.

1342
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:03,200
Why don't we go to my house and you can tell me your story.

1343
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:04,300
Okay.

1344
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:07,080
Looks like Tokomon is still unconscious.

1345
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:10,120
Wait, is Tokomon not gonna be my Digimon?

1346
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,640
I thought I can- I can't have three?

1347
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:29,920
So you were sucked in by the Digivice and unluckily fell into the dimension I created.

1348
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:31,300
Wait, you're gone?

1349
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:37,420
And then your partners in the Digivice defeated Machine Draymond for me.

1350
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:40,700
I see.

1351
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:43,900
Coincidence has been our friend today.

1352
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:46,640
I owe you my thanks.

1353
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:53,700
Actually, this world is at a crisis point.

1354
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:59,300
As you can see, the city we are in, Floatia, is in disarray.

1355
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:01,180
What's happening in Floatia?

1356
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:01,360
I don't know.

1357
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:04,800
It's because of the Machine Draymond.

1358
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:06,700
Yeah, him!

1359
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:08,580
I made him small now.

1360
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:12,960
He started attacking us for no reason and did a lot of damage to the city.

1361
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:15,040
Oh, like Kanya's Goon?

1362
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:16,520
He just Kanya's Nier Merl?

1363
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:17,500
Oh, okay.

1364
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,560
I know what to name our Digimon now.

1365
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:24,940
It appeared from nowhere and caused massive damage and then disappeared.

1366
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,780
We were at our wits' end.

1367
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:37,000
I mobilized my knowledge and technology to build a trap in order to capture the Machine Draymond.

1368
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:44,100
I thought that when it appeared, I could transport it to another dimension and imprison it.

1369
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:45,560
The plan worked.

1370
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:49,100
In fact, the plan went even better than expected.

1371
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:54,800
Thanks to you, we were able to defeat that Machine Draymond.

1372
01:03:55,240 --> 01:04:00,320
But that doesn't mean the danger has entirely passed.

1373
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:11,510
The phenomenon of a Machine Draymond getting violent and then disappearing has occurred several times in many areas.

1374
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:19,380
It would be hard to believe that it is just one lone Mega Digimon doing all this damage.

1375
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:23,980
So there's more of them that we have to stop.

1376
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:27,600
We were able to survive this time because of your valiant efforts.

1377
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:35,200
Unfortunately, we don't know from where and how the Machine Draymond are appearing.

1378
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:37,640
It seems hopeless.

1379
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,500
But if we just had a clue, maybe we could do something.

1380
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,800
If only we had a clue.

1381
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:52,900
Take away all the Digimon that like digivolve into Machine Draymond and teach them about the power of good.

1382
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:54,820
It's just that easy.

1383
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:58,340
Because they come from a specific line of Digimon.

1384
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:02,860
And all we have to do is make sure they don't go evil.

1385
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:04,040
What?

1386
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:09,280
This Tokomon was the Machine Draymond?

1387
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:11,400
It can't be.

1388
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:12,760
No.

1389
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:16,860
But I am sensing a strange data wave coming from this Tokomon.

1390
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:18,920
That's every evil Machine Digimon.

1391
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:22,300
Then we'll get all the Machine Digimon!

1392
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:26,320
What should we make of this?

1393
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:31,840
A Tokomon living in this city that digivolved into a Machine Draymond?

1394
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:38,300
I've never heard of such a Digi... Get all the Tokomon together and teach them the power of good.

1395
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:40,040
There's something here in the cloud memory.

1396
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:42,360
But why did this Tokomon digivolve into Machine Draymond?

1397
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:43,140
Just delete the code.

1398
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:44,280
Or we just delete the code.

1399
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:47,680
Or at least an alternate form of Machine Draymond.

1400
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,580
Get the code and just delete the line.

1401
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,240
That's all we need to do.

1402
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:57,820
We won't be able to figure it out with just this small amount of information from this Tokomon.

1403
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:04,200
But it looks like we finally have a chance to actually do something about this threat.

1404
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:06,800
We need to act.

1405
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:09,980
I have something to ask of you.

1406
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:11,340
Just erase them.

1407
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:13,820
It's like they never existed in the code.

1408
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:17,600
We want to return you back to the world you came from as soon as possible.

1409
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:21,680
But we can't leave this city in the state it's in.

1410
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:31,100
To get the city back to the way it was, will you help bring back the residents that fled from the Machine Draymond attacks?

1411
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:34,260
Why don't you do it yourself?

1412
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:36,800
Yeah, old man.

1413
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:41,340
I would do it myself, but there are too many children in the city.

1414
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,340
I can't leave them alone.

1415
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:45,260
I can babysit the kids.

1416
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:50,640
So, go out with your partners and look for the residents who fled the city.

1417
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:54,980
But like, why is he allowed to just like...

1418
01:06:54,980 --> 01:06:57,060
I will look into this small amount of strange data.

1419
01:06:57,060 --> 01:06:57,900
Why is he allowed to stay here?

1420
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:03,260
We have collected more information about the people outside the city than me.

1421
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:04,040
I just got here.

1422
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:06,820
He's old.

1423
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:08,060
He's not old.

1424
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:10,380
It's just what he looks like.

1425
01:07:13,580 --> 01:07:16,500
You can't grow old in Digimon.

1426
01:07:16,860 --> 01:07:18,240
You just die.

1427
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:22,860
That's why I first intend to make a detection device.

1428
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:25,200
That's literally what he looks like.

1429
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:27,080
He's not a real person.

1430
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:28,480
He's a Digimon.

1431
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:29,600
He was born in the city.

1432
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:31,220
I'm programmed to look like this.

1433
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:33,520
So please check your Digi-vice.

1434
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:35,100
He was born in...

1435
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:39,560
So then, I'm counting on you.

1436
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:45,380
He's literally an old, mad Digimon.

1437
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:51,420
Okay, it's not much, but all of us got these items for you.

1438
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:52,640
Oh, thank you, Kuromon!

1439
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:56,060
Oh my god, I got Portable Toilet!

1440
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:00,780
Okay, guys.

1441
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:03,640
For those who are like, why do you have a portable toilet?

1442
01:08:03,820 --> 01:08:07,160
If you don't poop, you're actually... you die.

1443
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:14,340
You get... you turn like ugly, apparently.

1444
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:17,520
If you don't poop, you turn ugly in your Digivolution.

1445
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:20,860
So I gotta make sure you like...

1446
01:08:20,860 --> 01:08:27,260
I gotta... I gotta make sure you use the bathroom.

1447
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:30,580
How do I...

1448
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:33,780
How do I like...

1449
01:08:33,780 --> 01:08:34,360
Oh, there we go.

1450
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:34,800
It's Y.

1451
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:36,680
Okay, um...

1452
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:40,200
Alright, we gotta bring... Oh my god, he yapped a lot.

1453
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:41,680
Okay, we gotta bring stuff down.

1454
01:08:41,980 --> 01:08:43,620
Okay, uh... voice...

1455
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:45,560
We bring down voice a little bit.

1456
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:48,840
And then, we bring down music a little bit, too.

1457
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:50,720
Alright.

1458
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:52,600
And then, we'll bring this down as well.

1459
01:08:52,820 --> 01:08:53,600
Alright, that should be good.

1460
01:08:55,020 --> 01:08:55,420
Alright.

1461
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:57,640
I wanna rename you.

1462
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,340
How do I rename... Oh, I got Digi-mail!

1463
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:01,000
Bring Digimon to town.

1464
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:03,020
Alright, we gotta look at the nine planes.

1465
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:03,700
Okay.

1466
01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:05,240
Uh... partner.

1467
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:08,420
Um... how do I change your name?

1468
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:11,040
Zerriermon.

1469
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:14,120
Uh... how do I change your name, guys?

1470
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:15,840
I'm gonna rename you.

1471
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:19,820
I wanna rename you guys.

1472
01:09:23,890 --> 01:09:24,870
How do I do it?

1473
01:09:25,350 --> 01:09:26,890
I don't want you guys to be cut.

1474
01:09:27,230 --> 01:09:28,050
Oh, I could...

1475
01:09:28,050 --> 01:09:29,450
Uh... Bakamon?

1476
01:09:29,730 --> 01:09:30,850
That's not Bakamon.

1477
01:09:30,870 --> 01:09:31,570
That's Gigi-mon.

1478
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:32,970
Who are you?

1479
01:09:33,410 --> 01:09:33,870
Punimon.

1480
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:35,490
Who do you wanna talk about?

1481
01:09:35,590 --> 01:09:37,290
I can tell you all you need to know about battle.

1482
01:09:37,490 --> 01:09:38,090
Okay, not that.

1483
01:09:39,030 --> 01:09:39,490
Uh...

1484
01:09:39,490 --> 01:09:40,650
You're not Bakamon.

1485
01:09:41,290 --> 01:09:42,190
You're Kodomon.

1486
01:09:42,750 --> 01:09:43,850
Oh, I have a chest.

1487
01:09:44,130 --> 01:09:44,590
Who are you?

1488
01:09:45,410 --> 01:09:46,330
That's Poyomon.

1489
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:48,430
Dimensional boxes?

1490
01:09:49,010 --> 01:09:50,370
What the fuck is that?

1491
01:09:55,990 --> 01:09:56,450
Alright.

1492
01:09:57,270 --> 01:09:57,730
Presents.

1493
01:09:57,890 --> 01:09:58,850
Oh, do I get presents?

1494
01:10:00,170 --> 01:10:01,090
Omega, Alt...

1495
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:02,210
Digivolution?

1496
01:10:03,030 --> 01:10:03,530
Oh!

1497
01:10:03,890 --> 01:10:05,750
What the fuck did I receive?

1498
01:10:07,230 --> 01:10:08,230
Battle Rankings?

1499
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:09,230
Okay, we're not fighting.

1500
01:10:09,410 --> 01:10:10,230
Oh, that's PvP.

1501
01:10:11,390 --> 01:10:12,450
Oh, I have new mail!

1502
01:10:16,090 --> 01:10:16,950
Daily quest.

1503
01:10:17,490 --> 01:10:19,030
Gather three quick fruits.

1504
01:10:19,190 --> 01:10:20,030
Oh, I get 3000.

1505
01:10:20,190 --> 01:10:21,850
Oh my gosh, there's quests and everything?

1506
01:10:22,190 --> 01:10:24,270
The longer I wait, the...

1507
01:10:24,270 --> 01:10:25,250
Oh, that's you guys!

1508
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:33,100
The 4HC now is the one Gigi-mon and the rest of us have work to rebuild.

1509
01:10:33,220 --> 01:10:33,840
But you're all children!

1510
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:35,020
How are you rebuilding?

1511
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:37,960
Oh, Kyudoki, hold on.

1512
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:39,260
Yeah?

1513
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:42,300
I show you around Felicia and teach you all sorts of things.

1514
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:43,220
But you're a child!

1515
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:44,860
How are you teaching me?

1516
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:46,140
You're literally a child!

1517
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:47,620
Okay.

1518
01:10:47,780 --> 01:10:49,180
Yeah, I need a tour guide anyway.

1519
01:10:56,670 --> 01:10:58,150
They're actually all kids!

1520
01:10:58,570 --> 01:11:00,630
Who let these kids work here?

1521
01:11:05,890 --> 01:11:08,510
Why are you letting children run the city?

1522
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:10,150
Is this the children town?

1523
01:11:10,410 --> 01:11:12,730
The infamous town for kids?

1524
01:11:13,230 --> 01:11:14,190
That's shut down?

1525
01:11:16,310 --> 01:11:17,630
The name is Tainmon.

1526
01:11:20,890 --> 01:11:22,350
Why do you think it was super chat?

1527
01:11:22,410 --> 01:11:22,670
Thank you.

1528
01:11:22,850 --> 01:11:26,750
There isn't a single game that wouldn't be improved with a poop mechanic.

1529
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:27,990
Not a single one.

1530
01:11:29,050 --> 01:11:30,270
How do you get me from this?

1531
01:11:30,450 --> 01:11:30,770
Why?

1532
01:11:30,810 --> 01:11:31,770
What's so weird about that?

1533
01:11:35,150 --> 01:11:37,050
Who let the kids run the city?

1534
01:11:37,050 --> 01:11:37,250
Kidnation!

1535
01:11:39,510 --> 01:11:42,230
Oh my god, it's kidnation all over again!

1536
01:11:42,870 --> 01:11:45,470
If not enough, go get some mushrooms or something.

1537
01:11:45,730 --> 01:11:47,550
When your partners are hungry, give them some meat.

1538
01:11:48,090 --> 01:11:49,030
You picked up.

1539
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:51,330
Oh, there's the portable potty.

1540
01:11:51,630 --> 01:11:52,970
And you know what comes up?

1541
01:11:53,030 --> 01:11:54,630
That's why we have a bathroom here.

1542
01:11:54,890 --> 01:11:57,650
As for a bathroom break, you'd better hurry on over here!

1543
01:11:59,490 --> 01:12:01,330
Next to that is the training hall.

1544
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:03,310
The training hall is a very important facility.

1545
01:12:04,110 --> 01:12:05,930
They'll explain everything when you go inside.

1546
01:12:06,250 --> 01:12:08,790
Okay, yeah, you guys gotta train too.

1547
01:12:10,510 --> 01:12:12,050
It's to train your partner Digimon.

1548
01:12:12,130 --> 01:12:14,230
For now, I'll give you a real rough rundown.

1549
01:12:15,270 --> 01:12:17,090
Touch this to do some training.

1550
01:12:17,210 --> 01:12:18,570
The training input will pop up.

1551
01:12:18,810 --> 01:12:20,630
Set and confirm what gear you want to partner.

1552
01:12:21,850 --> 01:12:24,670
Once time takes a single hour, it makes the Digimon tired.

1553
01:12:24,730 --> 01:12:26,230
Keep an eye on the fatigue.

1554
01:12:29,270 --> 01:12:32,470
In the etude, they could get sick or their life could diminish if that happens.

1555
01:12:32,690 --> 01:12:34,090
Let them rest on this bed.

1556
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:35,770
Oh, he's so cute!

1557
01:12:36,910 --> 01:12:38,750
Talk to Chichimon when it's time to rest.

1558
01:12:38,950 --> 01:12:41,750
When the sleep sign appears, let them sleep in care mode.

1559
01:12:41,870 --> 01:12:43,910
Oh my god, look at him!

1560
01:12:43,970 --> 01:12:44,910
He's so cute!

1561
01:12:46,550 --> 01:12:47,030
Alright.

1562
01:12:48,650 --> 01:12:54,150
If there's anything you don't get after that, ask Tsunomon and Mutimon about it.

1563
01:12:54,450 --> 01:12:55,570
They're all children!

1564
01:12:56,830 --> 01:12:59,090
They're actually all just...

1565
01:12:59,090 --> 01:13:03,350
Cause like, okay, by the way, these aren't even supposed to be children, cause these are babies.

1566
01:13:03,850 --> 01:13:08,830
Oh no, these are babies, and then these guys are like adolescents or something.

1567
01:13:09,090 --> 01:13:11,670
They're like toddlers.

1568
01:13:11,790 --> 01:13:16,090
Yeah, these are like I was just born, and these are like babies.

1569
01:13:16,570 --> 01:13:19,290
So like, I'm literally asking babies on what to do.

1570
01:13:20,470 --> 01:13:21,190
They're rookie.

1571
01:13:22,990 --> 01:13:24,830
You want to see this white machine here.

1572
01:13:24,910 --> 01:13:26,130
When you train, power will build up.

1573
01:13:26,190 --> 01:13:27,670
When the power fills up, you can improve that gear.

1574
01:13:27,810 --> 01:13:30,390
But there's no Digimon in the city that can do improvements yet.

1575
01:13:31,330 --> 01:13:32,390
I'm a master at training.

1576
01:13:32,470 --> 01:13:33,190
Go on, ask me.

1577
01:13:33,210 --> 01:13:33,890
You're a child!

1578
01:13:34,190 --> 01:13:34,610
Would you...

1579
01:13:34,650 --> 01:13:35,630
You're not a master of anything!

1580
01:13:36,050 --> 01:13:37,230
You're literally a child!

1581
01:13:39,210 --> 01:13:44,710
Training is focused more around adjusting Digivolution-related skills, but another important part is food effects.

1582
01:13:44,890 --> 01:13:46,990
Food items can be divided into eight types.

1583
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:48,630
Um, no thank you.

1584
01:13:49,290 --> 01:13:50,490
I don't really want to know.

1585
01:13:50,650 --> 01:13:52,410
Alright, let's start training one of you guys.

1586
01:13:52,750 --> 01:13:53,510
Let's train.

1587
01:13:53,890 --> 01:13:56,850
You can train your party positions with the left and right stick.

1588
01:13:57,450 --> 01:14:01,610
Stats on both sides around the circle of the set gear will increase a little.

1589
01:14:01,730 --> 01:14:07,490
For example, if strength is set, then stats and speed will also increase a little.

1590
01:14:08,490 --> 01:14:10,070
Bonuses are shown on both sides.

1591
01:14:10,290 --> 01:14:12,890
If you have a bonus, the stat will increase more.

1592
01:14:14,050 --> 01:14:14,850
Confirm with A.

1593
01:14:15,270 --> 01:14:15,710
Okay.

1594
01:14:17,090 --> 01:14:17,530
Uhhh...

1595
01:14:18,090 --> 01:14:20,090
I want you guys to be strong.

1596
01:14:24,270 --> 01:14:25,990
I want you guys to be...

1597
01:14:25,990 --> 01:14:26,690
You're not.

1598
01:14:26,730 --> 01:14:27,690
You don't need wisdom.

1599
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:29,510
Alright, go.

1600
01:14:30,570 --> 01:14:31,630
Play the role... Yo.

1601
01:14:31,810 --> 01:14:33,230
Press A to stop spinning.

1602
01:14:33,310 --> 01:14:34,270
Your win was indicated.

1603
01:14:34,530 --> 01:14:36,630
Then it... time it well and you may get... Oh!

1604
01:14:37,630 --> 01:14:38,970
Wait, which one is it?

1605
01:14:40,890 --> 01:14:41,370
This.

1606
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:41,790
Alright.

1607
01:14:42,030 --> 01:14:42,470
Yay!

1608
01:14:44,550 --> 01:14:46,910
Each time a Digimon train, fatigue increases.

1609
01:14:47,390 --> 01:14:50,790
They are in danger when their fatigue level is over 50%.

1610
01:14:51,390 --> 01:14:52,930
Give them rest or let them sleep.

1611
01:14:57,530 --> 01:14:59,490
Oh, it doesn't matter which one you hit.

1612
01:14:59,630 --> 01:15:00,390
Any icon?

1613
01:15:00,650 --> 01:15:01,310
Oh, okay.

1614
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:05,680
You guys are fine.

1615
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:07,420
Are you guys hungry?

1616
01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:10,560
How do I get you guys out of here?

1617
01:15:10,660 --> 01:15:11,140
I'm going to go to the other side.

1618
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:13,540
Oh no.

1619
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:20,380
After training 2, I can definitely...

1620
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:23,740
After training 2, I can definitely dive into...

1621
01:15:23,740 --> 01:15:24,340
something.

1622
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:27,960
I'm going out now.

1623
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:28,800
I'll think it over.

1624
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:32,000
Alright, I guess you guys have to keep training.

1625
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:34,200
Oh, you guys are hungry?

1626
01:15:34,820 --> 01:15:35,340
Um...

1627
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:36,460
I'm sorry.

1628
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:37,260
I...

1629
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,040
Be serious!

1630
01:15:41,220 --> 01:15:41,740
Sorry.

1631
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:43,720
They won't let me give you guys food.

1632
01:15:44,060 --> 01:15:44,380
So...

1633
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:47,420
Oh, I can feed them here?

1634
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:48,940
Items.

1635
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:50,180
Where is it?

1636
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:50,680
Meat?

1637
01:15:51,620 --> 01:15:52,940
How do I feed you guys?

1638
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:55,400
I'm just going to let you starve.

1639
01:15:56,140 --> 01:15:56,660
Am I?

1640
01:15:59,700 --> 01:16:00,580
Oh, okay.

1641
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:01,860
Hey guys!

1642
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:02,900
I have food!

1643
01:16:04,020 --> 01:16:06,400
I would never let you guys starve.

1644
01:16:06,940 --> 01:16:07,420
But...

1645
01:16:07,420 --> 01:16:09,140
A popular mushroom with digital sports.

1646
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:10,280
I'm just going to give you guys mushrooms.

1647
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:13,080
Meat is so hard to get.

1648
01:16:13,340 --> 01:16:14,600
So you guys are going to get mushrooms.

1649
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:16,860
Alright.

1650
01:16:17,420 --> 01:16:18,580
Wait down by...

1651
01:16:18,580 --> 01:16:19,680
Did I feed both of you guys?

1652
01:16:20,460 --> 01:16:21,240
Oh, I did!

1653
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:22,420
Alright.

1654
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:24,740
You're not hungry anymore, right?

1655
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:26,200
You're still hungry?

1656
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:28,420
Oh, I didn't feed you!

1657
01:16:28,780 --> 01:16:29,220
Sorry.

1658
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:31,520
Sorry, I don't need...

1659
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:32,940
You can tell which one is my favorite.

1660
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:34,920
Come on!

1661
01:16:35,020 --> 01:16:35,480
Eat up!

1662
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:39,360
Here you go.

1663
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:40,220
Here you go.

1664
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:40,600
Now!

1665
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:44,980
Alright, there you go.

1666
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,420
Now you guys are fat.

1667
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:49,300
Okay.

1668
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:51,200
Back to training you go.

1669
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:52,700
More strength.

1670
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:54,700
Be strong!

1671
01:16:56,540 --> 01:16:57,180
Yay!

1672
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:03,800
Alright.

1673
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:05,240
Now you're stronger!

1674
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:11,380
Are you digivolving?

1675
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:13,360
You're digivolving!

1676
01:17:18,450 --> 01:17:19,370
What are you?

1677
01:17:21,950 --> 01:17:23,710
Now you're a slime!

1678
01:17:23,830 --> 01:17:25,150
Now you're Gummymon!

1679
01:17:30,850 --> 01:17:31,370
Now you're Gummymon!

1680
01:17:31,370 --> 01:17:31,910
Where's the other one?

1681
01:17:32,090 --> 01:17:32,650
Oh, there you go.

1682
01:17:32,930 --> 01:17:34,110
You're going to be Cat now!

1683
01:17:38,030 --> 01:17:40,350
This guy digivolved too!

1684
01:17:41,110 --> 01:17:41,130
This guy digivolved too!

1685
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:46,600
Naruman!

1686
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:49,420
Naruman!

1687
01:17:52,930 --> 01:17:53,990
Oh my god!

1688
01:17:54,310 --> 01:17:54,990
Please, no.

1689
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:55,970
You're not going to be smart.

1690
01:17:56,250 --> 01:17:57,710
I can't have Dragoons for a long time.

1691
01:17:57,730 --> 01:17:58,310
You're smarter than me.

1692
01:17:58,550 --> 01:17:58,970
Alright.

1693
01:18:00,150 --> 01:18:03,390
Alright, now we leave.

1694
01:18:05,150 --> 01:18:06,070
Are you going out?

1695
01:18:06,190 --> 01:18:07,110
I think you better at least...

1696
01:18:07,110 --> 01:18:08,150
Are you not Rookie?

1697
01:18:10,870 --> 01:18:11,570
Wait, are you...

1698
01:18:11,570 --> 01:18:12,310
Is this not Rookie?

1699
01:18:12,470 --> 01:18:13,870
Are we still in Toddler form?

1700
01:18:15,090 --> 01:18:15,930
Is this still...

1701
01:18:15,930 --> 01:18:16,750
Is this not Rookie?

1702
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:23,790
They aren't a Rookie yet?

1703
01:18:23,930 --> 01:18:25,430
Oh, this is Toddler!

1704
01:18:25,430 --> 01:18:25,950
Okay.

1705
01:18:26,430 --> 01:18:28,030
Back to strength, guys.

1706
01:18:28,310 --> 01:18:28,850
Back to...

1707
01:18:31,690 --> 01:18:32,810
More strength!

1708
01:18:34,970 --> 01:18:36,810
Wait, is this like revival?

1709
01:18:36,850 --> 01:18:37,350
It's MP.

1710
01:18:37,870 --> 01:18:39,090
That's magic, right?

1711
01:18:41,390 --> 01:18:42,810
Now it's Baby too.

1712
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:43,990
Alright, back to...

1713
01:18:44,630 --> 01:18:46,790
Okay, back you go.

1714
01:18:50,550 --> 01:18:51,470
There you go.

1715
01:18:52,990 --> 01:18:53,550
Yay!

1716
01:18:53,930 --> 01:18:56,190
It's not 50% yet, so I can keep going.

1717
01:18:56,890 --> 01:18:57,850
Alright, guys.

1718
01:18:57,990 --> 01:18:59,070
You're still going to be training.

1719
01:18:59,390 --> 01:19:00,230
Alright, let's do it!

1720
01:19:00,790 --> 01:19:02,750
You're still... More strength!

1721
01:19:07,150 --> 01:19:08,470
More strength!

1722
01:19:09,770 --> 01:19:10,430
It's...

1723
01:19:10,430 --> 01:19:12,210
Un-ga-pung-a-time!

1724
01:19:14,950 --> 01:19:15,610
No!

1725
01:19:15,850 --> 01:19:17,150
I missed it!

1726
01:19:18,010 --> 01:19:19,150
Oh, now you're...

1727
01:19:20,810 --> 01:19:22,950
Who said you can be hungry?

1728
01:19:25,370 --> 01:19:26,970
Alright, here we go.

1729
01:19:28,550 --> 01:19:29,690
You guys need to poop yet?

1730
01:19:29,850 --> 01:19:31,050
No, you don't have poop meters.

1731
01:19:31,970 --> 01:19:32,850
You're still fine.

1732
01:19:34,370 --> 01:19:35,250
Here you go.

1733
01:19:36,510 --> 01:19:37,370
You're so...

1734
01:19:37,370 --> 01:19:38,550
Me-me!

1735
01:19:38,950 --> 01:19:39,910
Little ones.

1736
01:19:41,370 --> 01:19:42,910
Alright, now they're completely full.

1737
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:43,350
Okay.

1738
01:19:43,830 --> 01:19:44,830
Wait, do you need poop?

1739
01:19:45,130 --> 01:19:45,590
What is that?

1740
01:19:45,710 --> 01:19:46,310
Where are those icons?

1741
01:19:47,670 --> 01:19:48,530
Where are those icons?

1742
01:19:51,950 --> 01:19:52,910
Where are those icons?

1743
01:19:53,450 --> 01:19:54,330
Are you guys okay?

1744
01:19:55,150 --> 01:19:56,110
Are you...

1745
01:19:56,110 --> 01:19:58,210
My tummy hurt!

1746
01:19:58,770 --> 01:20:00,190
My tummy hurt!

1747
01:20:01,490 --> 01:20:02,770
Alright, let's see.

1748
01:20:03,790 --> 01:20:04,410
Um...

1749
01:20:05,230 --> 01:20:06,390
Wait, I can check the...

1750
01:20:07,290 --> 01:20:08,190
Digivolution line.

1751
01:20:09,370 --> 01:20:09,990
Uh...

1752
01:20:09,990 --> 01:20:10,750
Let's see.

1753
01:20:10,830 --> 01:20:11,430
Where is it?

1754
01:20:11,470 --> 01:20:12,070
Partner...

1755
01:20:12,070 --> 01:20:12,970
History...

1756
01:20:12,970 --> 01:20:14,630
No, it's more so here.

1757
01:20:14,970 --> 01:20:16,130
Oh, no!

1758
01:20:16,630 --> 01:20:18,010
Wait, I can make you...

1759
01:20:18,010 --> 01:20:18,550
Renamod?

1760
01:20:20,350 --> 01:20:21,430
Oh, no!

1761
01:20:24,210 --> 01:20:24,970
Oh, no.

1762
01:20:24,970 --> 01:20:25,090
Oh, no.

1763
01:20:25,090 --> 01:20:26,310
You're not gonna turn...

1764
01:20:26,310 --> 01:20:26,790
No!

1765
01:20:37,540 --> 01:20:39,120
That's not fair!

1766
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:43,500
Why do you have to be smart?

1767
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:50,260
You're too dumb to be a cat!

1768
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:53,080
It's not fair!

1769
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:55,600
Why are you too dumb to be a cat!

1770
01:21:01,780 --> 01:21:05,420
I need to turn things down.

1771
01:21:06,780 --> 01:21:10,160
I'm going to turn it down by another 10.

1772
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:13,760
And then music by another 7.

1773
01:21:15,380 --> 01:21:16,800
There we go.

1774
01:21:17,420 --> 01:21:19,300
I can't believe it!

1775
01:21:20,060 --> 01:21:25,240
Okay, what I can't believe is that you turn into a puppy and then into a cat.

1776
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:29,040
That one was what I can't believe too either.

1777
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:31,600
I can't believe it!

1778
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:35,060
Renamon's a rookie?

1779
01:21:35,740 --> 01:21:38,520
Renamon should not be a rookie, not going to lie.

1780
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:41,380
Renamon is like a woman.

1781
01:21:44,220 --> 01:21:49,220
You guys know damn well.

1782
01:21:49,900 --> 01:21:52,460
Renamon is not like a rookie.

1783
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:01,240
Not right.

1784
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:05,020
Okay, no, you got to be smart!

1785
01:22:05,980 --> 01:22:07,660
Fuck yeah, I'm going with Renamon.

1786
01:22:07,660 --> 01:22:08,760
I'm going to have woman.

1787
01:22:10,540 --> 01:22:11,660
All right, Teramon.

1788
01:22:12,580 --> 01:22:13,140
No!

1789
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:16,140
You don't, you're not even smart!

1790
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:20,040
Teramon, you need defense?

1791
01:22:22,420 --> 01:22:23,920
Oh my God.

1792
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:25,240
Who the fuck wants...

1793
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:26,100
Haguruman.

1794
01:22:27,140 --> 01:22:28,780
No, none of them is strength.

1795
01:22:28,820 --> 01:22:30,220
Respect for Gaomon.

1796
01:22:31,060 --> 01:22:32,540
Okay, we need...

1797
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:33,480
We need...

1798
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:33,980
Um...

1799
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:36,380
We need defense and speed.

1800
01:22:36,860 --> 01:22:38,320
Okay, defense, speed.

1801
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:39,220
What about you?

1802
01:22:40,660 --> 01:22:41,700
We need...

1803
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:42,720
Uh...

1804
01:22:43,460 --> 01:22:46,180
Oh, we don't even have like the conditions for Renamon.

1805
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:47,660
Renamon needs fucking magic.

1806
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:49,900
You don't even...

1807
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:51,740
You don't even love it yet.

1808
01:22:51,780 --> 01:22:52,820
Okay, we got a...

1809
01:22:52,820 --> 01:22:54,400
All right, we're just going to go with cat.

1810
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:55,780
Uh...

1811
01:22:55,780 --> 01:22:56,800
Hahaha.

1812
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:01,620
Renamon is a woman.

1813
01:23:01,780 --> 01:23:04,420
I screamed to the police officer.

1814
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:07,060
Thank you for the super chat, Razza.

1815
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:07,400
Thank you.

1816
01:23:08,460 --> 01:23:10,920
Renamon should not be a rookie Digimon.

1817
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:12,760
How is Renamon a rookie?

1818
01:23:13,140 --> 01:23:17,060
Renamon fucking beats the shit out of like all the other Digimon.

1819
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:18,700
She's so tall.

1820
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,940
She's so fucking tall.

1821
01:23:22,180 --> 01:23:22,740
Okay.

1822
01:23:23,180 --> 01:23:24,180
Wisdom and speed.

1823
01:23:24,180 --> 01:23:26,000
Goddamn, I have to give you guys books now.

1824
01:23:26,380 --> 01:23:26,820
Okay.

1825
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:29,180
All right, you two rest for now.

1826
01:23:31,220 --> 01:23:33,340
Wait, can I not make you guys rest?

1827
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,240
How do I make you guys rest?

1828
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:36,380
Are you guys not resting yet?

1829
01:23:36,580 --> 01:23:37,320
All right, rest.

1830
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:39,980
You guys not resting?

1831
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:43,880
Yes, rest.

1832
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:46,120
Yeah.

1833
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:47,940
If rookie, why tall?

1834
01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:50,840
Uh, Scrooge, thank you for the one gift this year.

1835
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:51,440
Thank you.

1836
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:52,920
That's so true.

1837
01:23:53,580 --> 01:23:54,940
Why are they tall?

1838
01:23:55,660 --> 01:23:56,580
Okay, fuck.

1839
01:23:56,640 --> 01:23:59,500
I now need to figure out what your lines are.

1840
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:02,680
Figure out your evolution line.

1841
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:04,000
All right.

1842
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:07,760
Okay, you are going to become Terimon.

1843
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:09,460
I need stat and speed.

1844
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:11,000
Okay, stat and speed.

1845
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:12,920
And then I have to buy you...

1846
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:14,460
I need to buy you a book.

1847
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:16,000
All right, here we go.

1848
01:24:17,740 --> 01:24:18,220
Nice.

1849
01:24:22,030 --> 01:24:22,510
Stat.

1850
01:24:22,870 --> 01:24:24,150
Okay, wisdom.

1851
01:24:25,450 --> 01:24:27,150
You went up, wisdom.

1852
01:24:27,390 --> 01:24:28,190
Now you got a poop?

1853
01:24:29,470 --> 01:24:30,490
God damn it.

1854
01:24:30,650 --> 01:24:31,510
Get over here.

1855
01:24:31,550 --> 01:24:32,790
We're taking you to the party.

1856
01:24:36,730 --> 01:24:37,750
They need a poop.

1857
01:24:37,890 --> 01:24:39,890
I can't stop them from that.

1858
01:24:42,770 --> 01:24:43,170
Okay.

1859
01:24:44,150 --> 01:24:46,810
There aren't anything around here yet, but you have a bunch more Digimon.

1860
01:24:46,830 --> 01:24:47,870
Come here, call them or bring them.

1861
01:24:48,030 --> 01:24:49,910
Then you can build facility and get to work.

1862
01:24:50,110 --> 01:24:51,670
It all depends on the effort you put in.

1863
01:24:52,010 --> 01:24:53,930
Oh, there's a bathroom in the gym?

1864
01:24:54,030 --> 01:24:54,130
I don't know.

1865
01:24:56,030 --> 01:24:56,970
I didn't know that.

1866
01:24:57,190 --> 01:24:58,610
This exit takes you out of the city.

1867
01:24:58,650 --> 01:25:00,230
Outside there are Digimon that will attack you.

1868
01:25:00,290 --> 01:25:02,270
If you play it right, you can avoid battles entirely.

1869
01:25:02,590 --> 01:25:04,630
If things get dicey, head back to the city.

1870
01:25:05,290 --> 01:25:07,710
Or you can open a Digi-vice by pressing Y.

1871
01:25:07,930 --> 01:25:09,050
You can check...

1872
01:25:11,490 --> 01:25:13,830
As well as Digi-mails sent to you there.

1873
01:25:18,260 --> 01:25:19,600
What the fuck happened?

1874
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:23,780
Why are these kids so knowledgeable?

1875
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:31,540
That's the end of my explanation.

1876
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:32,500
Thank you for listening.

1877
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:33,580
Alright.

1878
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:34,860
They seem satisfied.

1879
01:25:34,860 --> 01:25:35,900
We are in our new strength.

1880
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:38,080
Alright.

1881
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:39,920
You guys did great, Dragoons.

1882
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:42,140
Who is a good Dragoon?

1883
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:43,800
Bon up!

1884
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:44,420
Yay!

1885
01:25:45,100 --> 01:25:45,580
Alright.

1886
01:25:45,660 --> 01:25:46,900
Go use the potty now.

1887
01:25:47,260 --> 01:25:47,980
Go poop.

1888
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:49,960
Go.

1889
01:25:50,940 --> 01:25:52,160
Oh, we can't see.

1890
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:52,580
What?

1891
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:54,140
There's literally a door.

1892
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:55,880
Like, I'm not going to watch it.

1893
01:25:56,020 --> 01:25:57,520
I can't even see.

1894
01:25:57,520 --> 01:25:57,680
Like, I'm not going to watch it.

1895
01:25:57,740 --> 01:25:59,920
Oh, only one of you needs to poop?

1896
01:26:00,700 --> 01:26:01,880
Alright, get over here.

1897
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:04,380
What do you want me to see?

1898
01:26:05,180 --> 01:26:07,040
Alright, we gotta make sure you're a rookie.

1899
01:26:10,060 --> 01:26:12,080
Alright, speed... wisdom.

1900
01:26:14,660 --> 01:26:17,040
Are they... are they smart enough yet?

1901
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:21,300
Alright, here we go.

1902
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:23,500
Did they poop together?

1903
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:28,760
Alright, 76... 94.

1904
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:31,920
Okay, how much did you guys need?

1905
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:34,780
76, 94?

1906
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:36,240
Oh my... okay.

1907
01:26:36,380 --> 01:26:37,240
Oh, we got 8!

1908
01:26:37,340 --> 01:26:38,260
Okay, 80.

1909
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:39,680
Now you just need MP.

1910
01:26:40,340 --> 01:26:41,840
Alright, we need... oh wait, no.

1911
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:42,600
That's not what we need.

1912
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:43,340
We need more stats.

1913
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:43,900
Fuck!

1914
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,060
Okay, we need 150.

1915
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:48,340
I'm not turning you into Toy Agumon!

1916
01:26:48,700 --> 01:26:51,900
You're not gonna be Agumon under this roof!

1917
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:53,320
I don't care!

1918
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:54,280
I don't care if this is your calling!

1919
01:26:54,580 --> 01:26:57,520
You're never gonna be Agumon under this house!

1920
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:01,620
Alright, let's see.

1921
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:03,000
We still need to be smarter.

1922
01:27:03,220 --> 01:27:05,100
You're not gonna be Agumon!

1923
01:27:05,340 --> 01:27:09,780
If you live under this roof, I will never let you be a dinosaur!

1924
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:17,200
I need to buy you guys more books.

1925
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:18,160
Over here!

1926
01:27:18,660 --> 01:27:19,200
Why?

1927
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:23,480
But, Donkey, I wanna be a dinosaur!

1928
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:24,620
Dinosaur!

1929
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:29,840
You don't like this item?!

1930
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:30,200
Stop it!

1931
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:33,740
You think you can decide what you wanna eat?!

1932
01:27:34,740 --> 01:27:35,760
Time to eat!

1933
01:27:36,060 --> 01:27:38,040
That's right, now eat this mushroom!

1934
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:45,120
Good.

1935
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:48,940
Alright, now you're not hungry anymore.

1936
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:49,920
There you go.

1937
01:27:50,060 --> 01:27:51,940
Keep this tire bomb.

1938
01:27:55,900 --> 01:27:56,420
Alright.

1939
01:27:57,220 --> 01:27:58,480
Oh, no bonus.

1940
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,080
Pooping with homies is a bonding experience.

1941
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:02,960
You wouldn't get it!

1942
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:04,740
Thank you for the super chat, Kaz!

1943
01:28:04,860 --> 01:28:06,040
Thank you, thank you!

1944
01:28:06,540 --> 01:28:08,880
Are you guys... are you guys there yet?

1945
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:10,160
Alright, 94.

1946
01:28:11,180 --> 01:28:12,700
Wisdom, 22.

1947
01:28:16,660 --> 01:28:20,220
The dinosaurs are closer to dragons than cats, Donkey!

1948
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:23,320
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you!

1949
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:23,440
Thank you!

1950
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:25,900
Alright, are you guys tired?

1951
01:28:26,220 --> 01:28:28,000
How are you guys tired already?!

1952
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:31,860
How are you guys tired?!

1953
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:33,440
What's your tired meter?

1954
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:34,540
Oh my god, you guys are tired.

1955
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:35,560
I should take you to bed.

1956
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:36,160
Alright.

1957
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:37,680
Rest.

1958
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:39,080
Wait, we're still okay.

1959
01:28:39,260 --> 01:28:41,260
Wait, I don't know if I should like put you guys...

1960
01:28:41,260 --> 01:28:44,500
Uh, Donkey, don't make us read.

1961
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:45,860
Alright.

1962
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:47,240
Now rest.

1963
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:50,740
It's like a bear.

1964
01:28:50,820 --> 01:28:51,400
You ate!

1965
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:53,420
You ate the mushroom in the end!

1966
01:28:55,700 --> 01:28:56,600
Wait, what?

1967
01:28:56,780 --> 01:28:58,000
Are you guys digifoaming?

1968
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:00,640
No.

1969
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:01,880
No!

1970
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:03,360
I told you!

1971
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:06,060
You cannot turn into Aquaman!

1972
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:07,320
No!

1973
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:20,120
What am I gonna do with two Aquamans?!

1974
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:21,300
What?!

1975
01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:23,280
What am I...

1976
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:27,380
What am I gonna do with two Aquamans?!

1977
01:29:30,340 --> 01:29:31,200
Let's go!

1978
01:29:34,100 --> 01:29:36,780
This is who I am, mother!

1979
01:29:37,820 --> 01:29:38,960
Oh my god!

1980
01:29:39,020 --> 01:29:39,740
What am I gonna do?!

1981
01:29:39,740 --> 01:29:41,420
You fucking just deceived me!

1982
01:29:44,310 --> 01:29:46,610
I wanna tear your mind!

1983
01:29:47,770 --> 01:29:48,470
And...

1984
01:29:48,470 --> 01:29:50,630
And Gato's mind!

1985
01:29:50,670 --> 01:29:53,750
What am I fucking gonna do with Legos?!

1986
01:29:53,750 --> 01:29:54,610
Wait!

1987
01:29:54,610 --> 01:29:56,750
Somebody's just gonna take you apart!

1988
01:29:58,250 --> 01:29:59,450
Accept us!

1989
01:29:59,710 --> 01:30:02,130
Why did you make us ugly?

1990
01:30:02,570 --> 01:30:04,450
Ally, thank you for the super chat!

1991
01:30:04,550 --> 01:30:05,010
Thank you!

1992
01:30:05,050 --> 01:30:05,550
Thank you!

1993
01:30:06,810 --> 01:30:08,510
Oh my god!

1994
01:30:08,650 --> 01:30:10,530
Damn, that Lego looks...

1995
01:30:10,530 --> 01:30:12,250
That Lego is you!

1996
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:16,610
What am I gonna do with this?!

1997
01:30:16,610 --> 01:30:19,810
I don't even know what you can digivolve!

1998
01:30:23,390 --> 01:30:24,590
I don't even know what you can digivolve!

1999
01:30:25,890 --> 01:30:28,810
Why you did this to us?!

2000
01:30:28,810 --> 01:30:31,090
I want you to be a cat!

2001
01:30:34,230 --> 01:30:35,970
Oh... I guess I leave now!

2002
01:30:36,470 --> 01:30:36,950
Wait!

2003
01:30:38,210 --> 01:30:42,310
They seem satisfied with their new strength from training!

2004
01:30:46,530 --> 01:30:49,710
Don't worry, you'll die soon so I can restart!

2005
01:30:57,570 --> 01:31:00,270
I hope perfect this formula.

2006
01:31:00,670 --> 01:31:02,770
I hope perfect...

2007
01:31:04,510 --> 01:31:05,310
Alright.

2008
01:31:06,490 --> 01:31:07,850
What do I even get?

2009
01:31:08,190 --> 01:31:09,450
A fucking wizard mod?

2010
01:31:10,010 --> 01:31:12,070
You just turned into a person?

2011
01:31:12,390 --> 01:31:15,470
I don't want you to be Hyaga mod!

2012
01:31:16,090 --> 01:31:18,490
He's so... he looks so ugly!

2013
01:31:20,930 --> 01:31:21,730
Alright.

2014
01:31:21,730 --> 01:31:21,930
Alright.

2015
01:31:22,450 --> 01:31:25,190
What the fuck do I do with you two?

2016
01:31:25,850 --> 01:31:26,170
What?

2017
01:31:28,990 --> 01:31:29,430
Alright.

2018
01:31:29,870 --> 01:31:31,890
I wanna make the city even more wonderful.

2019
01:31:34,310 --> 01:31:35,070
The city.

2020
01:31:35,090 --> 01:31:35,730
Is it a village city?

2021
01:31:35,830 --> 01:31:36,630
This is a city.

2022
01:31:36,790 --> 01:31:38,530
Where do I... where is the guy that...

2023
01:31:38,530 --> 01:31:40,710
It appears sometimes when you pick up materials.

2024
01:31:41,190 --> 01:31:42,610
It's hard to get...

2025
01:31:44,690 --> 01:31:45,250
Let's go.

2026
01:31:45,410 --> 01:31:47,170
We get to be wizards.

2027
01:31:48,690 --> 01:31:51,210
Well, I guess we leave the city now.

2028
01:31:54,650 --> 01:31:55,010
Alright.

2029
01:31:55,310 --> 01:31:55,490
Alright.

2030
01:31:55,750 --> 01:31:56,830
Oh, there's Patamon!

2031
01:31:56,910 --> 01:31:57,610
Beat him up!

2032
01:31:58,790 --> 01:32:01,330
From here on, Digimon will appear to attack you as enemies.

2033
01:32:01,810 --> 01:32:03,430
Enemy Digimon react when you approach them.

2034
01:32:03,470 --> 01:32:04,450
They will chase you and...

2035
01:32:04,450 --> 01:32:05,650
Tetsuon will start a battle.

2036
01:32:05,850 --> 01:32:08,410
A Digimon that doesn't react may be one that comes to the city.

2037
01:32:08,490 --> 01:32:10,030
Talk to them with A or get closer.

2038
01:32:10,130 --> 01:32:10,770
Trigger an event.

2039
01:32:10,970 --> 01:32:11,570
Is that hostile?

2040
01:32:12,090 --> 01:32:13,450
Oh my god, there he is.

2041
01:32:14,050 --> 01:32:14,770
I hope...

2042
01:32:14,770 --> 01:32:16,510
Oh my god, it better be an enemy.

2043
01:32:16,670 --> 01:32:17,190
It's time.

2044
01:32:19,830 --> 01:32:21,110
Are you friendly or not?

2045
01:32:21,830 --> 01:32:22,330
No!

2046
01:32:22,710 --> 01:32:23,650
He's friendly!

2047
01:32:29,810 --> 01:32:31,290
Are you one of those humans?

2048
01:32:31,510 --> 01:32:33,950
Oh, I see you're controlling Machine Dreammon.

2049
01:32:35,250 --> 01:32:36,970
How dare you mess with Flutia.

2050
01:32:37,090 --> 01:32:37,310
I'll...

2051
01:32:37,310 --> 01:32:38,070
Oh, yes!

2052
01:32:38,390 --> 01:32:38,890
Yes!

2053
01:32:38,930 --> 01:32:40,630
It's time to teach Patamon a lesson!

2054
01:32:41,030 --> 01:32:43,430
Time to teach this giant thumb a lesson!

2055
01:32:46,890 --> 01:32:48,630
I think I was like, he's friendly.

2056
01:32:48,890 --> 01:32:49,590
Y'all chill.

2057
01:32:49,590 --> 01:32:51,870
He is definitely not friendly.

2058
01:32:54,350 --> 01:32:55,450
Use those claws!

2059
01:32:55,970 --> 01:32:59,270
Oh, you were not clo... You have to be close enough?

2060
01:33:00,750 --> 01:33:01,710
Beat him up!

2061
01:33:02,010 --> 01:33:03,690
Yeah, that's right.

2062
01:33:05,290 --> 01:33:05,890
Nice.

2063
01:33:07,270 --> 01:33:08,190
Okay, nice.

2064
01:33:08,250 --> 01:33:09,210
Now you got it.

2065
01:33:09,390 --> 01:33:10,570
I figured it out.

2066
01:33:11,450 --> 01:33:12,190
That's right.

2067
01:33:12,230 --> 01:33:13,030
Did you learn your lesson?

2068
01:33:14,470 --> 01:33:16,170
It doesn't really hurt.

2069
01:33:16,170 --> 01:33:16,310
It doesn't hurt.

2070
01:33:18,390 --> 01:33:19,870
Let's go back to town.

2071
01:33:20,370 --> 01:33:21,030
GGmon's waiting.

2072
01:33:22,970 --> 01:33:23,750
Potato down.

2073
01:33:24,710 --> 01:33:25,830
You know GGmon?

2074
01:33:26,110 --> 01:33:27,670
Don't tell me you're not a bad guy.

2075
01:33:30,770 --> 01:33:31,510
Is that right?

2076
01:33:31,670 --> 01:33:32,170
My bad.

2077
01:33:32,330 --> 01:33:33,350
I got ahead of myself.

2078
01:33:35,010 --> 01:33:36,950
I've never seen a human before, you see?

2079
01:33:38,490 --> 01:33:40,290
Right then, I'm going back to Flutia.

2080
01:33:40,390 --> 01:33:42,050
Give me a holler if you see me out there.

2081
01:33:42,410 --> 01:33:43,790
Wait, what does Patamon get me?

2082
01:33:45,530 --> 01:33:46,930
Patamon joined the city.

2083
01:33:49,050 --> 01:33:51,670
Please be proud of us.

2084
01:33:52,410 --> 01:33:54,750
The wild Digimon decided to join.

2085
01:33:54,790 --> 01:33:57,010
Now let's find some partner Digimon and bring them back.

2086
01:33:57,370 --> 01:34:00,490
Also, the Digimon mark appeared in the lower right corner.

2087
01:34:00,690 --> 01:34:03,070
A notice was displayed whatever DigiMail is delivered.

2088
01:34:03,550 --> 01:34:05,010
Okay, I know that.

2089
01:34:05,390 --> 01:34:06,950
What new DigiMail did I get?

2090
01:34:07,530 --> 01:34:08,470
I got mail.

2091
01:34:09,850 --> 01:34:11,430
Is your DigiMonsters going well?

2092
01:34:11,530 --> 01:34:13,430
I picked up lots of information about Digimon.

2093
01:34:13,430 --> 01:34:16,430
And asked the Botamon in my house to pass it on to you.

2094
01:34:16,450 --> 01:34:18,390
If you need any help, go talk to him.

2095
01:34:19,010 --> 01:34:23,190
Wait, wasn't he the one that was like... that can change names?

2096
01:34:25,350 --> 01:34:27,090
Does Botamon let me change names?

2097
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:35,600
I don't remember... you guys said that one of them lets me change names.

2098
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:36,780
I don't remember which one.

2099
01:34:38,220 --> 01:34:39,620
Oh, it's Bakumon?

2100
01:34:40,440 --> 01:34:40,880
Bukamon?

2101
01:34:41,180 --> 01:34:42,540
Oh, it's the fish one.

2102
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:45,340
I have good news?

2103
01:34:47,120 --> 01:34:50,020
Yeah, I fucking beat him up to come back home.

2104
01:34:52,180 --> 01:34:54,240
The city prosperity is now won.

2105
01:34:54,380 --> 01:34:55,480
There's still a long way to go.

2106
01:34:55,700 --> 01:34:56,900
It's the fish one.

2107
01:34:57,120 --> 01:34:57,420
Okay.

2108
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,560
Wait, stop looking at me like that.

2109
01:34:59,620 --> 01:35:01,560
Oh my god, you're so fucking ugly.

2110
01:35:02,460 --> 01:35:03,340
Oh, wait.

2111
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:08,220
Like... look at you.

2112
01:35:11,220 --> 01:35:14,000
Don't be... at least... you know what?

2113
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:15,320
Like... you're okay.

2114
01:35:15,320 --> 01:35:17,940
Compared to this guy over here.

2115
01:35:18,820 --> 01:35:20,040
How do you sleep?

2116
01:35:20,260 --> 01:35:20,940
I don't understand.

2117
01:35:21,660 --> 01:35:22,380
You sleep?

2118
01:35:23,580 --> 01:35:24,940
Let me sleep.

2119
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:26,020
Okay, there you go.

2120
01:35:26,460 --> 01:35:27,760
Sleep on the floor.

2121
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:33,500
Mom, please don't hate us.

2122
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:35,600
No, I'm not talking about you.

2123
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:36,840
You look fine.

2124
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:39,480
You're... you know, you're just Agumon.

2125
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:40,320
But like, wait.

2126
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:42,840
You... you're a...

2127
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:46,360
You have a face that even a mother couldn't love.

2128
01:35:46,540 --> 01:35:47,520
And I'm the mother.

2129
01:35:47,780 --> 01:35:49,260
But you, you're great, sweetie.

2130
01:35:49,480 --> 01:35:50,000
You look amazing.

2131
01:35:56,680 --> 01:35:57,860
It's food time.

2132
01:36:02,300 --> 01:36:05,900
Alright, are you guys satisfied?

2133
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:06,900
You're still hungry?

2134
01:36:09,300 --> 01:36:10,920
Freaky Lego mom.

2135
01:36:12,900 --> 01:36:14,560
That's all you got.

2136
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:15,780
Okay.

2137
01:36:18,860 --> 01:36:21,140
I wanted a fucking cat.

2138
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:25,560
We can do something with you.

2139
01:36:25,820 --> 01:36:27,560
I wanted a cat.

2140
01:36:32,700 --> 01:36:33,860
Okay, let's...

2141
01:36:35,460 --> 01:36:37,280
Oh yeah, we can get another more meat.

2142
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:38,920
The next day.

2143
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:40,300
Here's the meat.

2144
01:36:40,360 --> 01:36:40,880
Five?!

2145
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:42,360
You gave me ten yesterday.

2146
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:42,920
Hey!

2147
01:36:43,460 --> 01:36:44,920
Are you... Oh, Bakumon!

2148
01:36:45,060 --> 01:36:46,460
Alright, we gotta change your name.

2149
01:36:48,900 --> 01:36:51,820
Yeah, uh, I wanna change Toy Agumon.

2150
01:36:52,160 --> 01:36:53,560
Okay, Toy Agumon.

2151
01:36:55,420 --> 01:36:56,380
Okay, Goon...

2152
01:36:56,380 --> 01:36:58,240
Uh, Goon 3.

2153
01:36:58,500 --> 01:36:59,240
There we go.

2154
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:02,020
2, 4, 5, 6, 7... Yeah, there we go.

2155
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:02,980
Goon 3.

2156
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:04,780
Wait, what?

2157
01:37:05,020 --> 01:37:05,840
I can't do that?

2158
01:37:05,880 --> 01:37:08,180
Goon is actually a name you can't say!

2159
01:37:08,180 --> 01:37:11,420
3-mon... Okay, there we go.

2160
01:37:11,460 --> 01:37:12,100
Oh my god.

2161
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:16,100
3... D-Drumon.

2162
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:21,760
Goon is actually a fan.

2163
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:23,260
Alright.

2164
01:37:25,140 --> 01:37:26,440
Let's see, Patamon.

2165
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,540
No Gooning here.

2166
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:32,200
Leave Duplamon alone.

2167
01:37:33,620 --> 01:37:36,020
Thank you for the super chat, fans.

2168
01:37:36,180 --> 01:37:37,380
I thank you, thank you.

2169
01:37:37,380 --> 01:37:39,980
And store... I don't need to store anything.

2170
01:37:41,420 --> 01:37:42,800
Alright, get over here.

2171
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:45,680
No Goons allowed.

2172
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:48,660
Get over here.

2173
01:37:49,300 --> 01:37:51,100
I have to make do with what I have.

2174
01:37:54,180 --> 01:37:55,840
Alright, we got five...

2175
01:37:56,920 --> 01:37:59,340
We gotta... We got five more Digimon.

2176
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:00,360
Is there a thing here?

2177
01:38:00,440 --> 01:38:00,560
Where?

2178
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:01,680
Where's the thing?

2179
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:02,140
Here?

2180
01:38:02,540 --> 01:38:04,100
We can't get down here yet.

2181
01:38:04,280 --> 01:38:05,900
What's this thing are you guys talking about?

2182
01:38:05,900 --> 01:38:08,400
Alright, let's grab some mushrooms though.

2183
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:09,420
You guys need more food.

2184
01:38:10,100 --> 01:38:10,580
Yay!

2185
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:13,620
The game hates us?

2186
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:14,860
No, no, I don't hate you!

2187
01:38:15,340 --> 01:38:17,880
I don't hate you, D-Drumon4!

2188
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:20,840
It's you and I against the world.

2189
01:38:22,580 --> 01:38:24,060
Be strong for your mother.

2190
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:28,360
Holy shit, this guy's huge!

2191
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:30,360
Wait, he's level 6!

2192
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:31,460
Are we strong enough?

2193
01:38:31,940 --> 01:38:33,460
Well, it's time to find out.

2194
01:38:33,540 --> 01:38:35,300
If you guys die, I can always...

2195
01:38:35,300 --> 01:38:36,260
uh, restart.

2196
01:38:39,180 --> 01:38:40,640
You guys do it!

2197
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:41,720
Go, go, go!

2198
01:38:58,040 --> 01:38:59,260
Oh, you're alive!

2199
01:39:00,140 --> 01:39:01,100
Oh, you're...

2200
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:12,940
Oh shit, you're alive!

2201
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:14,060
Okay...

2202
01:39:14,060 --> 01:39:16,360
You can't be mad at me!

2203
01:39:16,360 --> 01:39:18,880
You literally died!

2204
01:39:22,020 --> 01:39:24,500
I just broke apart.

2205
01:39:24,940 --> 01:39:27,060
You can't be mad at me!

2206
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:27,780
You lied!

2207
01:39:34,460 --> 01:39:41,960
You literally are mad that you ran away, but you literally almost died in front of me!

2208
01:39:45,060 --> 01:39:48,680
I literally ran away so you guys can live!

2209
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:58,240
You know what, you didn't...

2210
01:39:59,700 --> 01:40:03,700
I was... I was supposed to know he was so much stronger!

2211
01:40:07,480 --> 01:40:07,860
Alright.

2212
01:40:08,220 --> 01:40:09,740
Let's collect some materials.

2213
01:40:11,820 --> 01:40:14,700
Mom, you only care for brother.

2214
01:40:15,260 --> 01:40:16,600
Mom, you only care for brother.

2215
01:40:21,560 --> 01:40:22,240
Oh,

2216
01:40:25,580 --> 01:40:25,820
okay.

2217
01:40:29,810 --> 01:40:33,230
It was like three times our size.

2218
01:40:33,850 --> 01:40:35,990
It was a level 6 champion.

2219
01:40:36,050 --> 01:40:36,890
I'm sorry!

2220
01:40:38,030 --> 01:40:40,210
I'm sorry that you're too weak!

2221
01:40:41,290 --> 01:40:45,050
If you were a cat, you would have won the fight.

2222
01:40:46,110 --> 01:40:46,530
Anyway...

2223
01:40:50,530 --> 01:40:52,770
The further you go, the stronger your enemies become.

2224
01:40:52,890 --> 01:40:54,410
You must build the strength of your partners.

2225
01:40:54,570 --> 01:40:58,390
For now, let's go to the 9 planes and get used to living with your partner Digimon.

2226
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:04,140
Oh, there's another guy!

2227
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:06,380
You guys can take him on, right?

2228
01:41:08,780 --> 01:41:10,440
I'll take this opportunity to explain more.

2229
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:12,000
I filled up your partners.

2230
01:41:12,060 --> 01:41:13,540
Let's do this battle to learn.

2231
01:41:13,820 --> 01:41:15,800
Oh, I should have went left instead of right.

2232
01:41:20,330 --> 01:41:23,470
Use the tactics methods to flee or change targets using items.

2233
01:41:24,350 --> 01:41:26,830
Time will be paused when the box is opened.

2234
01:41:27,050 --> 01:41:31,210
You can select items by moving up and down.

2235
01:41:31,390 --> 01:41:31,530
Okay.

2236
01:41:35,070 --> 01:41:36,350
Item to both partners.

2237
01:41:36,810 --> 01:41:38,990
Press L or R to change focus and use items individually.

2238
01:41:38,990 --> 01:41:41,830
LB or RB to change focus and use items individually.

2239
01:41:42,690 --> 01:41:46,630
Toss the right items to partners depending on the situation and give yourself a big advantage.

2240
01:41:47,370 --> 01:41:49,810
Press X to open the tactics menu.

2241
01:41:50,190 --> 01:41:51,970
Time will be paused when this is opened.

2242
01:41:52,250 --> 01:41:55,510
Here you can confirm who is targeting who or abandon and flee the fight.

2243
01:41:55,630 --> 01:41:58,510
If you choose to flee, you will be returned to the entrance of the sub arena.

2244
01:41:58,950 --> 01:42:02,090
Press L, B, or RB to individual commands.

2245
01:42:02,550 --> 01:42:08,750
The top commands indicate automatic MP usage in battle and the bottom command determines the target enemy.

2246
01:42:09,070 --> 01:42:11,930
Switch these depending on the situation and dominate in battle.

2247
01:42:12,230 --> 01:42:12,670
Okay.

2248
01:42:13,010 --> 01:42:14,290
You guys will be fine, right?

2249
01:42:16,630 --> 01:42:17,070
Yeah!

2250
01:42:20,850 --> 01:42:23,390
You guys just do that thing.

2251
01:42:23,950 --> 01:42:24,830
Now fight!

2252
01:42:25,790 --> 01:42:26,370
Fight!

2253
01:42:28,830 --> 01:42:29,930
See, you're fine.

2254
01:42:30,250 --> 01:42:31,730
See, it's like nothing bad happened.

2255
01:42:31,810 --> 01:42:32,510
See, they're level one!

2256
01:42:33,150 --> 01:42:33,670
Wow!

2257
01:42:33,790 --> 01:42:37,770
It's like, you know, you should have been fighting Digimon of your own level.

2258
01:42:41,850 --> 01:42:43,690
You guys did it!

2259
01:42:44,170 --> 01:42:44,750
Yay!

2260
01:42:50,210 --> 01:42:53,990
Good thing you guys fought Digimon of your own level, guys!

2261
01:42:54,570 --> 01:42:55,550
It's a good thing!

2262
01:42:59,310 --> 01:43:02,990
Now realize you guys were level one this entire time.

2263
01:43:03,770 --> 01:43:04,210
Um...

2264
01:43:04,210 --> 01:43:06,970
Guys, why didn't you tell me you were level one?

2265
01:43:07,170 --> 01:43:07,590
No...

2266
01:43:08,310 --> 01:43:09,890
Oh shit, you need a poop.

2267
01:43:10,030 --> 01:43:10,250
Okay.

2268
01:43:10,710 --> 01:43:12,390
Okay, um, we're gonna head home.

2269
01:43:12,630 --> 01:43:13,770
We're gonna head home.

2270
01:43:14,110 --> 01:43:15,230
Guys, no, no, no!

2271
01:43:15,270 --> 01:43:16,550
Hold in your poops, guys!

2272
01:43:17,150 --> 01:43:18,170
Hold it in!

2273
01:43:19,730 --> 01:43:20,690
Guys, please!

2274
01:43:20,870 --> 01:43:23,270
The city is like right beside us!

2275
01:43:26,430 --> 01:43:27,550
There's a toilet nearby?

2276
01:43:27,990 --> 01:43:28,810
Wait, where's the toilet?

2277
01:43:30,870 --> 01:43:32,170
Where's the toilet near us?

2278
01:43:32,850 --> 01:43:34,150
There's a potty potty?

2279
01:43:35,430 --> 01:43:36,350
Oh, there it is!

2280
01:43:36,390 --> 01:43:36,830
I see it!

2281
01:43:36,870 --> 01:43:37,410
It's over the bridge!

2282
01:43:37,630 --> 01:43:39,190
Guys, hold your poop!

2283
01:43:40,190 --> 01:43:42,070
Guys, there's a bathroom over the bridge!

2284
01:43:42,730 --> 01:43:43,210
No!

2285
01:43:43,210 --> 01:43:43,410
No!

2286
01:43:45,570 --> 01:43:48,090
I'm not wasting my potty potty!

2287
01:43:48,250 --> 01:43:49,410
I literally have two!

2288
01:43:49,910 --> 01:43:51,230
Hold it in your lego!

2289
01:43:51,350 --> 01:43:52,430
How are you supposed to poop?

2290
01:43:52,530 --> 01:43:53,510
You're literally lego!

2291
01:43:56,230 --> 01:43:58,310
Guys, we're almost there!

2292
01:43:59,010 --> 01:44:00,190
There's the bathroom!

2293
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:02,210
We're almost there!

2294
01:44:02,270 --> 01:44:03,090
Use the bathroom!

2295
01:44:04,090 --> 01:44:05,910
With the lego on poop.

2296
01:44:06,010 --> 01:44:07,070
Smaller lego.

2297
01:44:09,630 --> 01:44:10,250
Alright.

2298
01:44:10,250 --> 01:44:11,130
Yay!

2299
01:44:11,950 --> 01:44:13,450
Now you're happy again.

2300
01:44:13,550 --> 01:44:15,070
Thank fucking god!

2301
01:44:17,190 --> 01:44:18,530
How are you mad?

2302
01:44:18,710 --> 01:44:20,810
You- I- Okay, I am a good person.

2303
01:44:22,330 --> 01:44:24,470
I don't understand how you can be mad.

2304
01:44:24,770 --> 01:44:26,090
I don't understand.

2305
01:44:28,290 --> 01:44:28,810
Yay!

2306
01:44:30,150 --> 01:44:30,670
Oh!

2307
01:44:30,930 --> 01:44:32,330
He can't be that strong!

2308
01:44:33,190 --> 01:44:34,290
Yeah, it's a level 3!

2309
01:44:34,410 --> 01:44:35,270
You guys got this!

2310
01:44:35,330 --> 01:44:36,110
It's a level 3!

2311
01:44:37,850 --> 01:44:40,070
One of us is happy with the other.

2312
01:44:44,450 --> 01:44:45,590
Come on guys!

2313
01:44:46,690 --> 01:44:53,710
Look, this is why I love Gray- This is exactly why Gray Agumon is like my favorite.

2314
01:44:57,270 --> 01:44:58,470
Oh no!

2315
01:44:58,630 --> 01:44:59,270
Oh no!

2316
01:44:59,870 --> 01:45:00,950
Use your bubble!

2317
01:45:01,070 --> 01:45:01,570
Use your bubble!

2318
01:45:02,230 --> 01:45:03,130
Help him!

2319
01:45:03,850 --> 01:45:04,930
Help your bro-

2320
01:45:09,300 --> 01:45:11,080
Help your fucking brother!

2321
01:45:11,380 --> 01:45:12,460
Oh no!

2322
01:45:12,660 --> 01:45:13,260
Oh no!

2323
01:45:13,260 --> 01:45:13,800
Oh no!

2324
01:45:16,220 --> 01:45:17,000
Okay, nice.

2325
01:45:17,500 --> 01:45:18,160
That's good.

2326
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:20,340
Use your claws!

2327
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:20,940
Use your claws!

2328
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:22,960
Snow Agumon!

2329
01:45:23,060 --> 01:45:23,720
Go in there!

2330
01:45:26,700 --> 01:45:27,180
Okay.

2331
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:28,920
Oh, I can use the big one!

2332
01:45:32,060 --> 01:45:33,300
What am I doing?

2333
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:34,680
Oh, I can use Blizzard!

2334
01:45:35,860 --> 01:45:37,000
Why help him?

2335
01:45:37,060 --> 01:45:38,520
He's the favorite.

2336
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:41,160
Cause he's your brother!

2337
01:45:41,160 --> 01:45:43,800
You're supposed to love each other!

2338
01:45:44,220 --> 01:45:49,040
Without family- You can't go through the world without the bond of your brother!

2339
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:55,380
Yay!

2340
01:45:56,910 --> 01:45:57,620
Good job!

2341
01:45:57,840 --> 01:45:58,860
You did great guys!

2342
01:45:59,320 --> 01:46:01,320
You did great!

2343
01:46:01,320 --> 01:46:01,540
You did great!

2344
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:07,040
Yeah, Green Man's Digi- Evolution info.

2345
01:46:07,380 --> 01:46:08,680
Oh, I got- I got Gatomon?

2346
01:46:08,680 --> 01:46:10,960
Wait, I can still evolve to Gatomon!

2347
01:46:11,120 --> 01:46:11,720
It's so fun!

2348
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:12,920
This is why you're my favorite!

2349
01:46:14,540 --> 01:46:15,120
Wait!

2350
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:17,160
He can still be Gatomon?

2351
01:46:18,430 --> 01:46:18,720
Okay.

2352
01:46:20,760 --> 01:46:21,640
Oh my god.

2353
01:46:21,680 --> 01:46:22,720
I still- still hope.

2354
01:46:23,020 --> 01:46:24,620
There's still hope for you!

2355
01:46:25,020 --> 01:46:26,500
There's still hope!

2356
01:46:26,740 --> 01:46:28,220
The dream is alive!

2357
01:46:32,440 --> 01:46:34,620
The dream is still alive!

2358
01:46:37,560 --> 01:46:38,140
Okay.

2359
01:46:38,980 --> 01:46:39,500
Alright.

2360
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,100
Oh my god.

2361
01:46:41,160 --> 01:46:42,380
It's still alive!

2362
01:46:43,220 --> 01:46:46,660
We still have a chance to get Gatomon!

2363
01:46:46,760 --> 01:46:48,300
We still have a chance to get a cat!

2364
01:46:48,700 --> 01:46:50,580
You were supposed to be Terriermon!

2365
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:52,500
But we can still get a cat!

2366
01:46:52,720 --> 01:46:55,860
We can still get a- We can still get a cat!

2367
01:46:57,020 --> 01:46:57,540
Okay.

2368
01:46:57,540 --> 01:46:58,340
That's good!

2369
01:47:01,420 --> 01:47:01,940
Alright.

2370
01:47:02,140 --> 01:47:02,960
Oh shit!

2371
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:03,800
I should be healing!

2372
01:47:04,900 --> 01:47:05,420
Okay.

2373
01:47:05,700 --> 01:47:06,400
Give me a sec.

2374
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:07,180
We gotta heal.

2375
01:47:09,700 --> 01:47:10,140
Wait.

2376
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:11,560
Both of you got the heals?

2377
01:47:13,940 --> 01:47:14,380
Nice.

2378
01:47:14,580 --> 01:47:14,760
Alright.

2379
01:47:15,020 --> 01:47:17,100
Make sure you get that.

2380
01:47:17,220 --> 01:47:18,760
And I'll make sure you use a bubble.

2381
01:47:20,980 --> 01:47:21,700
Beat it up!

2382
01:47:21,780 --> 01:47:22,520
Beat up the plant!

2383
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:25,280
We don't need more oxygen in the world.

2384
01:47:25,320 --> 01:47:26,120
Beat up the plant!

2385
01:47:31,060 --> 01:47:31,500
Look!

2386
01:47:31,500 --> 01:47:32,340
I healed!

2387
01:47:34,160 --> 01:47:34,600
Nice.

2388
01:47:34,680 --> 01:47:34,920
Go!

2389
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:35,160
Go!

2390
01:47:35,200 --> 01:47:35,340
Go!

2391
01:47:36,220 --> 01:47:37,180
Help your brother!

2392
01:47:38,740 --> 01:47:39,380
Alright.

2393
01:47:39,480 --> 01:47:40,260
And then bubble.

2394
01:47:40,340 --> 01:47:40,920
Use the bubble!

2395
01:47:41,560 --> 01:47:42,580
Nice one!

2396
01:47:42,700 --> 01:47:45,660
Why does it keep fucking beating up SnowGreymon?

2397
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:47,060
Or Agumon?

2398
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:48,780
Nice hit!

2399
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:50,000
Alright.

2400
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:50,320
Cheer!

2401
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:50,540
Cheer!

2402
01:47:50,620 --> 01:47:50,740
Cheer!

2403
01:47:50,900 --> 01:47:52,060
You missed!

2404
01:47:53,460 --> 01:47:54,100
No!

2405
01:47:54,300 --> 01:47:55,080
Your brother!

2406
01:47:55,300 --> 01:47:56,420
Your brother needs her!

2407
01:48:03,040 --> 01:48:05,040
Fucking help your brother!

2408
01:48:06,660 --> 01:48:07,300
Yeah!

2409
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:11,780
Oh my god!

2410
01:48:11,780 --> 01:48:14,300
Let him get hit!

2411
01:48:14,540 --> 01:48:17,260
We're doing a lot with him!

2412
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:20,460
He's a favorite!

2413
01:48:20,680 --> 01:48:21,840
He can take it!

2414
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:25,500
No!

2415
01:48:26,100 --> 01:48:27,020
Oh wait!

2416
01:48:27,180 --> 01:48:28,920
He can come to the city!

2417
01:48:30,180 --> 01:48:31,460
What can I say?

2418
01:48:31,540 --> 01:48:32,860
I'm a gourmand!

2419
01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:36,080
This is a momentous occasion indeed!

2420
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:39,000
You see, I won five green digi stocks.

2421
01:48:39,220 --> 01:48:40,560
I don't have them.

2422
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:41,460
Sorry.

2423
01:48:41,460 --> 01:48:43,580
I don't have the digi stocks.

2424
01:48:43,940 --> 01:48:44,840
Oh no!

2425
01:48:44,920 --> 01:48:45,620
You need a bandaid?

2426
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:47,540
Okay, don't worry.

2427
01:48:47,640 --> 01:48:48,200
I got you.

2428
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:51,680
Uh... We need to give you a bandaid.

2429
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:53,560
Alright.

2430
01:48:53,620 --> 01:48:54,160
There you go.

2431
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:56,360
There you go.

2432
01:48:57,620 --> 01:48:58,780
You're healed now.

2433
01:48:59,220 --> 01:49:00,320
Oh thank god.

2434
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:01,040
It's okay.

2435
01:49:01,300 --> 01:49:02,360
You're okay now.

2436
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:11,020
Toy Agumon knows that he's not the favorite.

2437
01:49:11,120 --> 01:49:12,800
He's like not even happy.

2438
01:49:16,100 --> 01:49:16,700
Alright.

2439
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:17,540
Grab the wood.

2440
01:49:17,740 --> 01:49:18,200
Guys.

2441
01:49:18,460 --> 01:49:19,040
Yes.

2442
01:49:22,820 --> 01:49:24,300
I can collect one more time.

2443
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:25,320
Okay, I'll collect one more time.

2444
01:49:27,160 --> 01:49:27,760
Alright.

2445
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:29,560
Dragoon... Dragoon...

2446
01:49:29,560 --> 01:49:31,300
Dragoon 4 is...

2447
01:49:31,300 --> 01:49:33,280
Dragoon 3 is still mad.

2448
01:49:33,700 --> 01:49:35,620
Why are you still mad?

2449
01:49:36,920 --> 01:49:37,780
Oh no!

2450
01:49:39,180 --> 01:49:40,340
Oh no.

2451
01:49:41,140 --> 01:49:41,360
This is bad.

2452
01:49:42,260 --> 01:49:44,100
This is really bad.

2453
01:49:44,500 --> 01:49:45,120
Uh...

2454
01:49:45,120 --> 01:49:50,400
We gotta make sure that he's okay.

2455
01:49:52,060 --> 01:49:52,780
Alright.

2456
01:49:52,860 --> 01:49:53,120
Nice.

2457
01:49:54,300 --> 01:49:55,020
Okay.

2458
01:49:55,260 --> 01:49:56,560
I need...

2459
01:49:56,560 --> 01:49:58,360
Your brother does not want to help.

2460
01:49:58,980 --> 01:50:00,240
Oh thank god.

2461
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:00,660
Okay.

2462
01:50:02,260 --> 01:50:02,980
Help!

2463
01:50:03,020 --> 01:50:03,620
Help him!

2464
01:50:05,500 --> 01:50:07,080
Stop running away!

2465
01:50:07,340 --> 01:50:08,340
Dragoon 3!

2466
01:50:10,940 --> 01:50:12,720
Your brother needs help!

2467
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:13,280
Your brother needs help!

2468
01:50:13,500 --> 01:50:14,880
You were born together!

2469
01:50:15,800 --> 01:50:15,880
You were born together!

2470
01:50:15,880 --> 01:50:16,240
Go for it!

2471
01:50:18,260 --> 01:50:19,600
That's how you do it!

2472
01:50:20,660 --> 01:50:21,700
Oh no.

2473
01:50:22,080 --> 01:50:22,840
Please!

2474
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:24,140
He's getting... Brother!

2475
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:26,560
I refuse.

2476
01:50:26,920 --> 01:50:28,360
It's his battle.

2477
01:50:28,740 --> 01:50:30,780
You guys were born together!

2478
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:33,260
What happened to the brotherly bonds?

2479
01:50:34,500 --> 01:50:36,020
What happened?

2480
01:50:36,080 --> 01:50:36,540
What happened?

2481
01:50:36,540 --> 01:50:38,300
What happened?

2482
01:50:39,540 --> 01:50:40,260
Okay.

2483
01:50:40,980 --> 01:50:41,700
Uh...

2484
01:50:42,340 --> 01:50:42,980
Okay.

2485
01:50:43,020 --> 01:50:43,620
We're gonna use claws.

2486
01:50:44,200 --> 01:50:45,340
Oh I missed.

2487
01:50:45,500 --> 01:50:47,880
I keep forgetting that you have to be closer together.

2488
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:50,600
Toki happens.

2489
01:50:50,980 --> 01:50:52,720
No Bros got this.

2490
01:50:52,780 --> 01:50:54,820
All you do is run away!

2491
01:50:55,340 --> 01:50:55,840
Why?

2492
01:50:56,600 --> 01:50:57,800
I don't...

2493
01:50:58,760 --> 01:51:01,100
Why do you back up?

2494
01:51:01,100 --> 01:51:02,720
Just attack him!

2495
01:51:03,640 --> 01:51:04,740
You just...

2496
01:51:04,740 --> 01:51:07,420
You're letting your brother do all the work!

2497
01:51:07,420 --> 01:51:08,340
Like...

2498
01:51:09,260 --> 01:51:11,620
He's just a one-eyed...

2499
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,240
He can't...

2500
01:51:13,240 --> 01:51:14,880
WALK UP TO HIM!

2501
01:51:19,420 --> 01:51:21,200
Holy shit.

2502
01:51:21,940 --> 01:51:24,160
It's called dodging.

2503
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:25,320
I'm scared.

2504
01:51:26,140 --> 01:51:28,020
Oh the gas...

2505
01:51:28,020 --> 01:51:28,380
How?

2506
01:51:28,640 --> 01:51:30,000
How are you out of MP?

2507
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:32,140
Oh my god.

2508
01:51:32,160 --> 01:51:33,760
You're still walking away!

2509
01:51:34,440 --> 01:51:35,340
I...

2510
01:51:35,340 --> 01:51:36,840
used it.

2511
01:51:38,300 --> 01:51:40,100
Oh my god.

2512
01:51:40,300 --> 01:51:42,280
Oh my god.

2513
01:51:42,420 --> 01:51:43,040
Oh my god.

2514
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:46,220
Your brother at least is trying his best here.

2515
01:51:47,040 --> 01:51:50,820
This is exactly why Snow Agumon is my favorite.

2516
01:51:50,980 --> 01:51:52,940
This is why Dragoon IV is my favorite.

2517
01:51:53,160 --> 01:51:54,840
This is exactly why.

2518
01:51:55,180 --> 01:51:56,320
This is exactly why.

2519
01:51:56,320 --> 01:51:58,060
This is exactly why.

2520
01:51:58,360 --> 01:51:59,120
Please.

2521
01:51:59,140 --> 01:51:59,540
Why?

2522
01:51:59,960 --> 01:52:03,120
How is you still not recharging MP enough?

2523
01:52:03,480 --> 01:52:04,100
Nice one!

2524
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:07,220
You never train our MP.

2525
01:52:07,420 --> 01:52:07,960
You never train our MP.

2526
01:52:08,140 --> 01:52:08,700
You never train our MP.

2527
01:52:11,940 --> 01:52:13,060
Holy shit.

2528
01:52:13,260 --> 01:52:14,300
Oh no.

2529
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:16,520
How do I leave this area?

2530
01:52:16,780 --> 01:52:18,880
How do I leave this area?

2531
01:52:18,960 --> 01:52:19,880
I'm fucked up.

2532
01:52:19,880 --> 01:52:21,220
I walked the wrong way.

2533
01:52:22,080 --> 01:52:23,000
Oh no.

2534
01:52:23,220 --> 01:52:24,780
They're still chasing me.

2535
01:52:24,920 --> 01:52:25,540
Oh he's gone.

2536
01:52:25,720 --> 01:52:26,860
Okay we gotta pick up this apple.

2537
01:52:27,400 --> 01:52:29,200
He's not a fighter.

2538
01:52:29,280 --> 01:52:30,300
He's a dancer.

2539
01:52:30,980 --> 01:52:32,120
Oh I got an apple!

2540
01:52:33,640 --> 01:52:34,200
Alright.

2541
01:52:34,840 --> 01:52:36,700
At least he's happy.

2542
01:52:37,560 --> 01:52:38,720
Alright we got it.

2543
01:52:38,740 --> 01:52:39,720
Oh there's another green sock.

2544
01:52:41,300 --> 01:52:42,340
I'm a lego.

2545
01:52:43,400 --> 01:52:44,040
I'm a lego.

2546
01:52:45,960 --> 01:52:47,600
What about being a little brother?

2547
01:52:47,740 --> 01:52:49,540
Always throw your brother under the bus.

2548
01:52:49,600 --> 01:52:50,080
Rule 2.

2549
01:52:50,160 --> 01:52:51,540
Take credit afterwards.

2550
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:53,200
Why are you mad?

2551
01:52:54,660 --> 01:52:56,060
What do you want?

2552
01:52:56,700 --> 01:52:57,660
Dragoon III.

2553
01:52:58,060 --> 01:52:58,580
Or IV.

2554
01:52:59,340 --> 01:53:00,920
No you're IV.

2555
01:53:01,200 --> 01:53:01,980
You're III.

2556
01:53:01,980 --> 01:53:03,060
You're III.

2557
01:53:03,340 --> 01:53:04,040
IV is better.

2558
01:53:04,220 --> 01:53:04,500
Yeah.

2559
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:07,900
Sorry I lost track of the numbers.

2560
01:53:08,420 --> 01:53:10,820
Because you don't love him.

2561
01:53:11,580 --> 01:53:13,480
I am a lego.

2562
01:53:13,660 --> 01:53:17,460
I am a lego.

2563
01:53:17,960 --> 01:53:19,280
Alright we got it.

2564
01:53:19,380 --> 01:53:19,440
Alright we got it.

2565
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:20,180
It doesn't recharge?

2566
01:53:20,840 --> 01:53:22,160
That is not true.

2567
01:53:22,480 --> 01:53:24,880
Drag- oh wait there's a- There's a mushroom here.

2568
01:53:27,200 --> 01:53:31,180
Dragoon IV's- Dragoon IV's MP recharge.

2569
01:53:31,400 --> 01:53:31,860
Dragoon IV's MP recharge.

2570
01:53:31,980 --> 01:53:34,040
Why didn't your MP recharge?

2571
01:53:34,240 --> 01:53:34,980
Dragoon III?

2572
01:53:37,020 --> 01:53:37,720
Dragoon III.

2573
01:53:37,780 --> 01:53:38,840
Where was your recharge?

2574
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:45,040
Dragoon IV is the golden child.

2575
01:53:46,120 --> 01:53:47,200
Wait you're hungry?

2576
01:53:47,680 --> 01:53:49,540
Okay we'll get food when we're home.

2577
01:53:49,700 --> 01:53:50,740
We'll get food when we're home.

2578
01:53:50,880 --> 01:53:52,020
Guys we're almost home.

2579
01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:54,060
He's a lion.

2580
01:53:57,880 --> 01:53:59,440
I scolded you once.

2581
01:53:59,520 --> 01:54:00,900
Because you wouldn't eat mushrooms.

2582
01:54:03,660 --> 01:54:06,220
I scolded you one time.

2583
01:54:06,680 --> 01:54:08,820
Just one time.

2584
01:54:08,840 --> 01:54:10,040
Because you were being a picky eater.

2585
01:54:12,040 --> 01:54:14,300
And I'm the bad guy.

2586
01:54:14,760 --> 01:54:16,520
Oh you don't like this item?

2587
01:54:18,330 --> 01:54:18,950
Bad.

2588
01:54:20,250 --> 01:54:21,690
Bad Dragoon.

2589
01:54:28,070 --> 01:54:29,170
Now eat.

2590
01:54:30,370 --> 01:54:31,090
No.

2591
01:54:31,330 --> 01:54:32,030
No.

2592
01:54:32,130 --> 01:54:32,850
No.

2593
01:54:32,950 --> 01:54:33,670
No.

2594
01:54:34,070 --> 01:54:34,790
No.

2595
01:54:36,410 --> 01:54:37,130
Good.

2596
01:54:37,270 --> 01:54:38,910
Now you're hungry.

2597
01:54:39,790 --> 01:54:42,330
Now we're gonna have our fill.

2598
01:54:42,490 --> 01:54:43,130
See?

2599
01:54:44,830 --> 01:54:45,550
Dragoon.

2600
01:54:47,150 --> 01:54:49,310
This Dragoon likes it.

2601
01:54:49,510 --> 01:54:50,290
This Dragoon likes it.

2602
01:54:50,410 --> 01:54:50,710
This Dragoon likes it.

2603
01:54:50,710 --> 01:54:51,330
Alright let's see.

2604
01:54:51,810 --> 01:54:55,130
I need to...

2605
01:54:55,130 --> 01:54:56,450
I need to...

2606
01:54:56,450 --> 01:55:00,290
Dragoon III I don't understand why you don't like...

2607
01:55:00,290 --> 01:55:02,210
Why don't you like the mushrooms?

2608
01:55:02,830 --> 01:55:03,030
Why don't you like the mushrooms?

2609
01:55:03,030 --> 01:55:04,530
Alright how's your bond with me?

2610
01:55:04,810 --> 01:55:05,990
Not so great.

2611
01:55:06,210 --> 01:55:06,770
Hey!

2612
01:55:15,550 --> 01:55:18,270
You can't tell...

2613
01:55:18,270 --> 01:55:20,890
Which one's the favorite child.

2614
01:55:24,810 --> 01:55:27,150
I wonder why.

2615
01:55:27,150 --> 01:55:27,310
Why?

2616
01:55:40,070 --> 01:55:40,830
Dragoon IV.

2617
01:55:41,990 --> 01:55:43,650
You're doing great sweetie.

2618
01:55:43,890 --> 01:55:45,270
You're doing great Dragoon IV.

2619
01:55:45,330 --> 01:55:46,030
Dragoon III!

2620
01:55:46,670 --> 01:55:48,550
Why are you running away from your mom?

2621
01:55:55,910 --> 01:55:56,430
Okay.

2622
01:55:57,210 --> 01:55:58,010
Let's see.

2623
01:55:59,230 --> 01:55:59,910
Um...

2624
01:55:59,910 --> 01:56:02,330
How do I get you to...

2625
01:56:02,330 --> 01:56:04,690
What do I need to train you for?

2626
01:56:06,550 --> 01:56:07,230
Uh...

2627
01:56:07,230 --> 01:56:10,210
He doesn't even want you close.

2628
01:56:10,490 --> 01:56:11,110
He doesn't even want you close.

2629
01:56:11,550 --> 01:56:12,230
Alright.

2630
01:56:12,570 --> 01:56:17,290
Oh there's a chance you might evolve into Wizard Mom because you're malnourished!

2631
01:56:17,650 --> 01:56:18,490
Oh there's a chance you might evolve into Wizard Mom because you're malnourished!

2632
01:56:18,490 --> 01:56:18,570
Oh no!

2633
01:56:19,670 --> 01:56:19,730
Oh no!

2634
01:56:21,630 --> 01:56:23,170
Oh my god!

2635
01:56:23,830 --> 01:56:24,850
Oh my god!

2636
01:56:26,430 --> 01:56:27,990
There's a chance you're gonna be a wizard mom.

2637
01:56:29,650 --> 01:56:32,470
You don't have the weight.

2638
01:56:38,330 --> 01:56:40,430
I didn't mean to!

2639
01:56:42,430 --> 01:56:43,470
Oh yeah.

2640
01:56:43,730 --> 01:56:44,030
GG!

2641
01:56:44,390 --> 01:56:45,530
Do you have like...

2642
01:56:45,530 --> 01:56:48,710
So I've collected all the information about all the Digimon in the city borders.

2643
01:56:49,270 --> 01:56:52,470
I've asked Botemon over there to help you with everything that we learned.

2644
01:56:52,950 --> 01:56:55,090
If you ever fix, just talk to Botemon, okay?

2645
01:56:55,190 --> 01:56:55,830
Don't forget!

2646
01:56:55,830 --> 01:56:57,610
Oh, I thought he has like free stuff.

2647
01:57:01,250 --> 01:57:01,610
Dragoon.

2648
01:57:01,750 --> 01:57:02,250
Dragoon 4.

2649
01:57:02,390 --> 01:57:03,150
You're doing great.

2650
01:57:03,330 --> 01:57:04,630
You're doing so great.

2651
01:57:04,730 --> 01:57:07,350
I can't wait for you to turn into a cat soon.

2652
01:57:08,510 --> 01:57:09,470
You're my favorite.

2653
01:57:10,310 --> 01:57:10,870
Dragoon 3.

2654
01:57:11,250 --> 01:57:11,770

2655
01:57:11,870 --> 01:57:12,350
Get over here.

2656
01:57:12,350 --> 01:57:12,850

2657
01:57:12,890 --> 01:57:13,250

2658
01:57:13,310 --> 01:57:13,750

Let's see...

2662
01:57:26,290 --> 01:57:26,810
Starving.

2663
01:57:26,810 --> 01:57:28,130
Can you find food?

2664
01:57:28,270 --> 01:57:29,810
What about us?

2665
01:57:31,190 --> 01:57:32,630
What do I want to get?

2666
01:57:32,890 --> 01:57:33,690
I want... Oh yeah.

2667
01:57:33,850 --> 01:57:35,590
I want to explore more.

2668
01:57:36,130 --> 01:57:37,290
Are we fully healed?

2669
01:57:37,410 --> 01:57:38,350
How do we heal up?

2670
01:57:38,430 --> 01:57:39,290
Do we just rest?

2671
01:57:40,390 --> 01:57:42,470
Guys, how do we heal up?

2672
01:57:42,590 --> 01:57:45,070
He's actually running away.

2673
01:57:47,390 --> 01:57:49,130
How do we heal up?

2674
01:57:50,910 --> 01:57:52,510
Go to the resting?

2675
01:57:53,070 --> 01:57:53,810
Oh, here?

2676
01:57:54,010 --> 01:57:54,750
Sharpen your skills!

2677
01:57:55,210 --> 01:57:55,610
Alright.

2678
01:57:57,470 --> 01:57:57,870
Rest.

2679
01:57:59,110 --> 01:57:59,850
I don't know.

2680
01:57:59,930 --> 01:58:01,090
Ask our brother.

2681
01:58:04,670 --> 01:58:05,470
There we go.

2682
01:58:06,530 --> 01:58:07,630
Oh my god!

2683
01:58:12,130 --> 01:58:14,310
I don't know what to train you guys for.

2684
01:58:15,050 --> 01:58:15,790
I don't know.

2685
01:58:16,230 --> 01:58:18,350
What was the idea for Gaonomon?

2686
01:58:20,750 --> 01:58:21,150
Alright.

2687
01:58:21,250 --> 01:58:21,870
Oh, you need to poop.

2688
01:58:22,070 --> 01:58:22,550
Okay, don't worry.

2689
01:58:22,630 --> 01:58:23,770
I'll take you guys to the bathroom.

2690
01:58:23,770 --> 01:58:25,130
Alright, time to poop, guys.

2691
01:58:25,890 --> 01:58:26,770
Time to poop.

2692
01:58:30,130 --> 01:58:33,790
I like how all of you guys associate stuff with like...

2693
01:58:34,370 --> 01:58:36,370
with like, Dragoon...

2694
01:58:36,370 --> 01:58:37,210
Oh yeah.

2695
01:58:37,310 --> 01:58:38,690
Stop being mad!

2696
01:58:39,350 --> 01:58:41,550
Your brother doesn't like it when you're mad!

2697
01:58:42,170 --> 01:58:42,730
Dragoon...

2698
01:58:43,310 --> 01:58:44,710
Stop being mad!

2699
01:58:46,090 --> 01:58:46,910
Dragoon 3.

2700
01:58:47,170 --> 01:58:49,090
Dragoon 4 doesn't like it when you're mad!

2701
01:58:55,210 --> 01:58:56,390
We want attention.

2702
01:58:56,590 --> 01:58:58,270
I'm giving you guys attention!

2703
01:58:59,750 --> 01:59:02,130
It's not my fault you fucking won't eat mushrooms!

2704
01:59:05,930 --> 01:59:06,410
Alright.

2705
01:59:06,750 --> 01:59:07,330
Let's go.

2706
01:59:07,630 --> 01:59:08,770
Is there anything here?

2707
01:59:08,990 --> 01:59:09,530
Is there?

2708
01:59:10,350 --> 01:59:11,410
I feel like...

2709
01:59:11,410 --> 01:59:12,610
We got to go this way.

2710
01:59:13,710 --> 01:59:14,350
Oh wait.

2711
01:59:14,390 --> 01:59:15,030
Do we have...

2712
01:59:15,030 --> 01:59:15,930
How do we save?

2713
01:59:16,070 --> 01:59:16,770
Oh, there it is.

2714
01:59:16,770 --> 01:59:17,310
Wow!

2715
01:59:17,590 --> 01:59:19,570
We did not save our game!

2716
01:59:23,630 --> 01:59:26,070
Okay, but who's Dragoon...

2717
01:59:27,730 --> 01:59:29,330
But who's Dragoon 4 in my chat?

2718
01:59:32,690 --> 01:59:34,550
Alright, let's go this way.

2719
01:59:35,110 --> 01:59:36,610
Where am I supposed to go anyway?

2720
01:59:37,510 --> 01:59:38,150
Map.

2721
01:59:39,950 --> 01:59:41,010
I'm here.

2722
01:59:41,530 --> 01:59:42,370
Where's star?

2723
01:59:42,450 --> 01:59:43,170
Material spot.

2724
01:59:43,470 --> 01:59:44,390
Fishing hole.

2725
01:59:44,450 --> 01:59:44,990
There's fishing?

2726
01:59:45,830 --> 01:59:47,230
Oh, there's fishing!

2727
01:59:47,930 --> 01:59:49,070
Oh, that's cool.

2728
01:59:50,550 --> 01:59:51,670
I volunteer.

2729
01:59:52,490 --> 01:59:53,970
Oh, he's level 2!

2730
01:59:54,210 --> 01:59:54,670
Get him!

2731
01:59:54,750 --> 01:59:55,370
It's a goblin!

2732
01:59:57,690 --> 02:00:00,930
I would rather die than be...

2733
02:00:00,930 --> 02:00:01,350
Wait!

2734
02:00:01,490 --> 02:00:02,890
They're not fully healed yet!

2735
02:00:03,850 --> 02:00:04,410
What?

2736
02:00:04,610 --> 02:00:05,890
I thought they... I rested!

2737
02:00:06,930 --> 02:00:08,030
They're not rest?

2738
02:00:08,810 --> 02:00:10,770
Inside you there are two Dragoons.

2739
02:00:12,550 --> 02:00:14,690
Oh no, oh no, no, no, no, no.

2740
02:00:14,770 --> 02:00:14,970
Oh no, oh no, no, no, no, no.

2741
02:00:14,990 --> 02:00:15,350
Help!

2742
02:00:15,370 --> 02:00:16,010
Help your brother!

2743
02:00:16,070 --> 02:00:16,570
Help your brother!

2744
02:00:16,770 --> 02:00:17,590
He's gonna die!

2745
02:00:18,030 --> 02:00:18,970
Help your brother!

2746
02:00:20,150 --> 02:00:21,110
Help your brother!

2747
02:00:21,230 --> 02:00:21,950
He's gonna die!

2748
02:00:22,390 --> 02:00:23,010
Get up!

2749
02:00:23,130 --> 02:00:23,390
No!

2750
02:00:26,120 --> 02:00:26,920
Oh my god.

2751
02:00:27,960 --> 02:00:28,980
Wake up!

2752
02:00:29,540 --> 02:00:30,260
Wake up!

2753
02:00:35,280 --> 02:00:36,680
How do you heal?

2754
02:00:37,400 --> 02:00:38,540
I don't understand.

2755
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:41,860
Not live the game.

2756
02:00:42,500 --> 02:00:44,440
I didn't know he was gonna die!

2757
02:00:44,460 --> 02:00:46,280
I thought your brother was gonna help you!

2758
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:47,620
Good aim!

2759
02:00:50,120 --> 02:00:51,920
I thought he was a favorite child!

2760
02:00:52,080 --> 02:00:53,640
That's why he got instantly rest!

2761
02:00:53,880 --> 02:00:55,580
And then when Dragoon...

2762
02:00:55,580 --> 02:00:57,400
When Dragoon 3...

2763
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,180
died, I fucking just ran.

2764
02:01:03,820 --> 02:01:04,460
Nice.

2765
02:01:06,620 --> 02:01:07,260
Yay!

2766
02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:11,860
Oh, we got some MP discs too.

2767
02:01:12,420 --> 02:01:14,240
The battle and your partner's return.

2768
02:01:14,640 --> 02:01:14,940
Yay!

2769
02:01:15,060 --> 02:01:16,140
You did great guys!

2770
02:01:16,200 --> 02:01:17,060
Great job!

2771
02:01:20,120 --> 02:01:20,900
You got...

2772
02:01:21,840 --> 02:01:23,940
Gardenmon, you got Gatomon, did you?

2773
02:01:24,100 --> 02:01:24,500
Oh!

2774
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:25,240
Speed!

2775
02:01:25,660 --> 02:01:26,400
Oh, bonds!

2776
02:01:26,600 --> 02:01:26,860
Okay!

2777
02:01:27,060 --> 02:01:28,520
Okay, we gotta figure out...

2778
02:01:28,520 --> 02:01:30,340
Okay, I gotta pick up this apple though.

2779
02:01:32,460 --> 02:01:32,900
Okay.

2780
02:01:33,760 --> 02:01:35,820
How do I... So how do they heal?

2781
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:38,000
I don't wanna use my items.

2782
02:01:38,160 --> 02:01:39,100
Oh god, it's night time.

2783
02:01:39,180 --> 02:01:39,680
What the fuck?

2784
02:01:40,080 --> 02:01:42,440
I did not expect it to be night time.

2785
02:01:46,920 --> 02:01:49,320
Oh, sleep at the end of the day.

2786
02:01:49,520 --> 02:01:49,960
Okay.

2787
02:01:50,120 --> 02:01:51,580
Alright, Gatomon.

2788
02:01:52,040 --> 02:01:53,180
Bond is there.

2789
02:01:53,740 --> 02:01:54,840
Speed is not.

2790
02:01:55,220 --> 02:01:57,800
Okay, we gotta train up your speed, guys.

2791
02:01:58,740 --> 02:01:59,900
Uh... Okay.

2792
02:01:59,960 --> 02:02:01,980
This is not good that like, uh...

2793
02:02:01,980 --> 02:02:05,580
It's not good that the weight portion is satisfied.

2794
02:02:05,960 --> 02:02:07,380
So we gotta...

2795
02:02:08,400 --> 02:02:11,320
We gotta make sure that...

2796
02:02:12,280 --> 02:02:14,760
I mean, Wizardmon's pretty cool.

2797
02:02:15,280 --> 02:02:17,140
Oh, speed isn't important.

2798
02:02:17,440 --> 02:02:18,680
Oh, it has no speed.

2799
02:02:18,820 --> 02:02:19,120
Okay.

2800
02:02:20,120 --> 02:02:20,400
I get it.

2801
02:02:21,940 --> 02:02:22,880
I get it now.

2802
02:02:23,380 --> 02:02:24,860
Speed does not matter.

2803
02:02:25,040 --> 02:02:26,260
Alright, let's get all the materials.

2804
02:02:27,900 --> 02:02:28,620
Okay, nice.

2805
02:02:28,780 --> 02:02:32,620
I like how we're using Dragoon 3 to farm the wood.

2806
02:02:34,020 --> 02:02:34,620
Oh, no!

2807
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:35,860
Okay, Dragoon 4 is helping!

2808
02:02:36,480 --> 02:02:36,960
Nice.

2809
02:02:38,520 --> 02:02:39,480
Uh... Map.

2810
02:02:39,700 --> 02:02:40,060
Okay.

2811
02:02:40,300 --> 02:02:41,140
Map time.

2812
02:02:42,360 --> 02:02:43,460
Wait, how do I...

2813
02:02:44,100 --> 02:02:44,940
Map time.

2814
02:02:45,220 --> 02:02:47,380
There is a subquest right here.

2815
02:02:47,740 --> 02:02:49,600
We're just gonna run from that.

2816
02:02:50,300 --> 02:02:50,820
Real quick.

2817
02:02:50,980 --> 02:02:51,340
Oh!

2818
02:02:53,940 --> 02:02:55,400
Oh, no, no, no, no, stop chasing!

2819
02:02:55,560 --> 02:02:55,940
Stop chasing!

2820
02:02:56,140 --> 02:02:56,800
I wanna talk to him!

2821
02:02:56,880 --> 02:02:57,620
I wanna talk to him!

2822
02:03:00,700 --> 02:03:01,420
It's Tentamon!

2823
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:05,500
I was thinking around these parts.

2824
02:03:05,640 --> 02:03:06,260
Hey, wait a minute.

2825
02:03:06,340 --> 02:03:07,260
Are you one of them humans?

2826
02:03:07,720 --> 02:03:08,580
Boy, howdy!

2827
02:03:08,740 --> 02:03:10,440
It must have been fate that brought us together.

2828
02:03:10,680 --> 02:03:12,240
I saw something tell you, in fact.

2829
02:03:12,740 --> 02:03:13,600
So what do you think?

2830
02:03:13,760 --> 02:03:14,860
Have I piped your interest?

2831
02:03:15,100 --> 02:03:15,560
Or do you want us...

2832
02:03:16,080 --> 02:03:17,940
I should pick your nose instead?

2833
02:03:19,620 --> 02:03:20,200
Uh...

2834
02:03:20,200 --> 02:03:22,220
Go on and pick it.

2835
02:03:22,460 --> 02:03:23,020
Oh!

2836
02:03:24,040 --> 02:03:25,560
What the fuck?

2837
02:03:27,660 --> 02:03:29,920
Have I picked your interest?

2838
02:03:30,040 --> 02:03:30,840
Or... Well, alright.

2839
02:03:31,580 --> 02:03:32,160
Okay.

2840
02:03:32,560 --> 02:03:33,140
Alright.

2841
02:03:33,400 --> 02:03:35,440
I could tell you were a sharp one.

2842
02:03:35,580 --> 02:03:37,240
Now then, check out this...

2843
02:03:38,960 --> 02:03:40,040
Batten Boy.

2844
02:03:43,660 --> 02:03:44,580
Ta-da!

2845
02:03:44,620 --> 02:03:45,560
A recovery chest!

2846
02:03:45,560 --> 02:03:47,060
Just what every tamer needs.

2847
02:03:47,320 --> 02:03:49,880
I can let it go for now a hundred bits.

2848
02:03:51,140 --> 02:03:51,620
Uh...

2849
02:03:51,620 --> 02:03:53,180
Sure, I'll do it.

2850
02:03:54,040 --> 02:03:54,520
Thanks.

2851
02:03:54,620 --> 02:03:54,920
Really?

2852
02:03:55,120 --> 02:03:57,200
Well then, pleasure doing business with you, partner!

2853
02:03:58,220 --> 02:04:00,880
Thanks to you, I can finally open my item shop!

2854
02:04:01,080 --> 02:04:03,320
I'll have more deals down the line!

2855
02:04:03,440 --> 02:04:04,780
So give me a holler in town!

2856
02:04:05,180 --> 02:04:06,300
Peace out, hombre!

2857
02:04:12,300 --> 02:04:12,780
Yeah!

2858
02:04:13,480 --> 02:04:13,960
Tentamon!

2859
02:04:15,540 --> 02:04:17,520
Tentamon has joined the army!

2860
02:04:18,660 --> 02:04:21,680
Alright, let's see... We have to head to... Uh...

2861
02:04:22,280 --> 02:04:23,100
Oh, fishing!

2862
02:04:23,340 --> 02:04:24,020
How do I fish?

2863
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:26,360
Oh, I don't have a fishing rod.

2864
02:04:26,500 --> 02:04:27,000
Not yet.

2865
02:04:27,220 --> 02:04:27,760
Oh, wait!

2866
02:04:27,840 --> 02:04:28,660
Can you guys farm this?

2867
02:04:29,720 --> 02:04:30,980
Yeah, grab some stones!

2868
02:04:31,280 --> 02:04:32,380
Grab some stones, dragons!

2869
02:04:35,600 --> 02:04:37,380
Farm the stone, dragon 3!

2870
02:04:39,460 --> 02:04:40,460
Come on, dragon 3!

2871
02:04:41,120 --> 02:04:42,000
You can still do it!

2872
02:04:43,580 --> 02:04:44,700
Come on, dragon 3!

2873
02:04:44,800 --> 02:04:45,460
Farm harder!

2874
02:04:45,660 --> 02:04:46,760
Use your lego hands!

2875
02:04:48,660 --> 02:04:50,340
Mom, my brother hit me!

2876
02:04:50,620 --> 02:04:51,980
Stop hitting each other!

2877
02:04:55,620 --> 02:04:57,860
Oh, I can't carry any more materials.

2878
02:04:58,160 --> 02:04:58,500
Okay.

2879
02:04:58,760 --> 02:05:00,920
Guys, you guys gotta stop hitting each other!

2880
02:05:01,040 --> 02:05:01,260
Alright?

2881
02:05:01,320 --> 02:05:02,660
You guys were born together!

2882
02:05:02,840 --> 02:05:03,920
We are a family!

2883
02:05:04,140 --> 02:05:06,120
I love you both equally!

2884
02:05:10,420 --> 02:05:17,260
You both share the same amount of love I have for the both of you, despite some failures on one of you guys.

2885
02:05:18,860 --> 02:05:19,940
That's a lie!

2886
02:05:21,900 --> 02:05:22,740
Oh, Beelmon!

2887
02:05:22,980 --> 02:05:23,920
Here I go!

2888
02:05:24,740 --> 02:05:25,380
Dang it!

2889
02:05:25,540 --> 02:05:26,440
Can't do it!

2890
02:05:27,480 --> 02:05:29,400
I wanna fly all through the sky!

2891
02:05:29,720 --> 02:05:32,260
The thing is though, I'm not very good at it.

2892
02:05:32,500 --> 02:05:34,380
Won't someone teach me how to fly?

2893
02:05:35,940 --> 02:05:36,420
Um...

2894
02:05:36,420 --> 02:05:37,740
I don't think it's possible.

2895
02:05:39,060 --> 02:05:40,020
Keep trying!

2896
02:05:40,140 --> 02:05:41,140
You can do it, Beelmon!

2897
02:05:45,320 --> 02:05:45,900
I will!

2898
02:05:46,120 --> 02:05:46,460
Thanks!

2899
02:05:46,840 --> 02:05:49,920
If you meet any Digimon that could give some pointers, please let me know!

2900
02:05:50,620 --> 02:05:52,700
Wait, do I need like a Digimon that can fly?

2901
02:05:54,460 --> 02:05:55,080
What's this?

2902
02:05:56,620 --> 02:05:57,100
Oh!

2903
02:05:57,220 --> 02:05:57,760
I got fruit!

2904
02:05:58,580 --> 02:06:01,820
Oh, I need like a Digimon that can fly to help them.

2905
02:06:04,260 --> 02:06:04,740
...

2906
02:06:05,900 --> 02:06:07,660
Thank you for the super chat!

2907
02:06:07,760 --> 02:06:08,140
Thank you!

2908
02:06:08,640 --> 02:06:13,680
So far, this game has had pooping and picking boogers.

2909
02:06:13,820 --> 02:06:17,480
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, why Pokemon was more successful.

2910
02:06:17,480 --> 02:06:19,660
Well, thank you for the super chat!

2911
02:06:19,760 --> 02:06:21,280
Thank you, thank you, Rassan!

2912
02:06:22,040 --> 02:06:22,560
Um...

2913
02:06:23,180 --> 02:06:28,800
I think like... No, I just need you guys to know, Digimon World 1 was so hardcore.

2914
02:06:29,280 --> 02:06:34,000
It was like, a lot more brutal than it is!

2915
02:06:36,460 --> 02:06:42,760
Because like, if they, if they are, if they need to use the bathroom, they will poop on the floor.

2916
02:06:44,560 --> 02:06:45,680
They'll do it!

2917
02:06:45,680 --> 02:06:51,100
And like, you do not have time to... You do not have time to take them to the bathroom.

2918
02:06:51,820 --> 02:06:52,760
Got a second?

2919
02:06:54,900 --> 02:06:55,900
Made my day!

2920
02:06:56,800 --> 02:06:57,760
Oh, I got...

2921
02:06:57,760 --> 02:06:58,780
Yeah, I got a Tentamon!

2922
02:07:00,140 --> 02:07:02,000
Yeah, he's gonna open up an item shop!

2923
02:07:02,300 --> 02:07:03,360
I got two now!

2924
02:07:07,820 --> 02:07:08,300
Okay.

2925
02:07:08,300 --> 02:07:08,780
Nice!

2926
02:07:10,020 --> 02:07:10,500
Alright.

2927
02:07:10,800 --> 02:07:11,640
You're hungry?

2928
02:07:13,340 --> 02:07:15,380
Oh, they poop on the floor here too?

2929
02:07:15,560 --> 02:07:15,940
...

2930
02:07:18,660 --> 02:07:24,300
I knew like, they poop on the floor, but they also like, um... Okay, we're gonna feed you guys mushrooms.

2931
02:07:25,940 --> 02:07:26,580
Here you go!

2932
02:07:27,700 --> 02:07:28,920
Here's a mushroom for you!

2933
02:07:31,720 --> 02:07:33,340
Alright, maybe I should give you guys...

2934
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:35,320
Are you guys tired?

2935
02:07:35,600 --> 02:07:36,420
Are you guys still hungry?

2936
02:07:36,620 --> 02:07:37,660
Why are you guys still hungry?

2937
02:07:40,660 --> 02:07:41,060
Fine!

2938
02:07:41,060 --> 02:07:42,560
I'll give you guys meat!

2939
02:07:44,360 --> 02:07:45,240
There you go!

2940
02:07:45,660 --> 02:07:47,240
Are you guys happier now?

2941
02:07:49,660 --> 02:07:51,480
Are you guys happier now?

2942
02:07:52,740 --> 02:07:53,320
Are you guys happier now?

2943
02:07:53,500 --> 02:07:54,340
There you go!

2944
02:07:54,500 --> 02:07:54,740
See?

2945
02:07:55,640 --> 02:07:58,280
Okay, someone said I need to talk to a specific mon.

2946
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:00,880
Um, to get free items.

2947
02:08:03,280 --> 02:08:06,960
There's a plant-type Digimon in Nine Plains who wants some kind of material.

2948
02:08:07,260 --> 02:08:09,980
A bug-type Digimon has been spotted in the forest.

2949
02:08:10,280 --> 02:08:12,560
And there's a Digimon in need of a good meal in the forest.

2950
02:08:12,640 --> 02:08:14,980
Oh, that's the one that wants the green mushrooms.

2951
02:08:16,520 --> 02:08:17,000
Alright.

2952
02:08:17,240 --> 02:08:18,680
Which one talked to Kuromon?

2953
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:20,580
Which one was Kuromon again?

2954
02:08:21,060 --> 02:08:22,080
Is this Kuromon?

2955
02:08:22,420 --> 02:08:23,180
Okay, no.

2956
02:08:23,240 --> 02:08:25,860
That's... Are you Kur... No, that's Tokomon.

2957
02:08:26,240 --> 02:08:27,220
What is Kuromon?

2958
02:08:27,580 --> 02:08:28,920
What does Kuromon look like?

2959
02:08:29,620 --> 02:08:29,860
...

2960
02:08:32,200 --> 02:08:34,000
Are you Kuromon?

2961
02:08:34,140 --> 02:08:35,000
No, you're Poyomon.

2962
02:08:35,400 --> 02:08:37,080
I can never rem... Oh!

2963
02:08:37,220 --> 02:08:39,500
I talked to everybody but Kuromon!

2964
02:08:40,100 --> 02:08:40,680
...

2965
02:08:41,240 --> 02:08:41,580
...

2966
02:08:43,900 --> 02:08:44,580
Sorry.

2967
02:08:44,580 --> 02:08:47,900
I don't remember what the babies look like.

2968
02:08:48,220 --> 02:08:51,320
I only remember like the rookies and the champions.

2969
02:08:51,960 --> 02:08:54,940
The baby names are like so hard to remember.

2970
02:08:57,780 --> 02:08:58,560
Let's see.

2971
02:09:00,620 --> 02:09:02,600
I need you to be the cat.

2972
02:09:02,940 --> 02:09:04,640
I just want you to be a cat.

2973
02:09:05,260 --> 02:09:06,000
It's hot.

2974
02:09:10,560 --> 02:09:11,520
You need to sleep?

2975
02:09:11,600 --> 02:09:12,940
You're not tired yet, right guys?

2976
02:09:13,880 --> 02:09:15,320
I don't think you guys are tired yet.

2977
02:09:15,340 --> 02:09:16,800
So we can go... We can go outside.

2978
02:09:16,900 --> 02:09:18,100
and explore a little bit longer.

2979
02:09:19,540 --> 02:09:20,820
We sleep when...

2980
02:09:20,820 --> 02:09:22,780
We sleep when I see you be tired.

2981
02:09:26,900 --> 02:09:28,560
Not until you see the ZZZ.

2982
02:09:28,780 --> 02:09:29,000
Oh!

2983
02:09:29,960 --> 02:09:30,720
What would...

2984
02:09:30,720 --> 02:09:31,840
What would make him a cat?

2985
02:09:34,260 --> 02:09:34,740
Guys.

2986
02:09:36,260 --> 02:09:37,700
What would make him a cat?

2987
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,060
Toy... Toy Agumon is like...

2988
02:09:41,840 --> 02:09:42,660
Um... No.

2989
02:09:42,720 --> 02:09:43,180
It's hopeless.

2990
02:09:43,440 --> 02:09:44,960
But I can still...

2991
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:45,120
...

2992
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:48,160
Dragoon... Dragoon 4?

2993
02:09:49,040 --> 02:09:50,160
I have potential in Dragoon 4.

2994
02:09:50,480 --> 02:09:51,980
Dragoon 3, you're hopeless.

2995
02:09:52,220 --> 02:09:54,080
But Dragoon 4, you have potential still.

2996
02:09:54,660 --> 02:09:54,940
Uh...

2997
02:09:57,660 --> 02:09:59,260
It is wisdom.

2998
02:10:00,800 --> 02:10:01,320
Wait.

2999
02:10:01,500 --> 02:10:01,800
What?

3000
02:10:01,840 --> 02:10:02,800
Wisdom for both?

3001
02:10:02,900 --> 02:10:04,760
I think they hit wisdom already, didn't they?

3002
02:10:06,580 --> 02:10:07,100
Yeah.

3003
02:10:07,180 --> 02:10:07,520
Oh no.

3004
02:10:07,580 --> 02:10:07,760
Okay.

3005
02:10:07,880 --> 02:10:08,320
Wisdom.

3006
02:10:08,420 --> 02:10:08,720
Okay.

3007
02:10:08,960 --> 02:10:09,840
Keep getting stronger!

3008
02:10:10,100 --> 02:10:11,560
Mom, calm me.

3009
02:10:11,940 --> 02:10:12,580
Don't worry.

3010
02:10:12,660 --> 02:10:13,580
We can remake you.

3011
02:10:13,700 --> 02:10:15,680
You're not forever hopeless.

3012
02:10:16,120 --> 02:10:17,200
The moment...

3013
02:10:19,220 --> 02:10:20,420
You still have potential.

3014
02:10:21,460 --> 02:10:22,600
In your next life.

3015
02:10:25,140 --> 02:10:27,480
You still have potential in your next life.

3016
02:10:27,860 --> 02:10:28,200
Alright.

3017
02:10:28,240 --> 02:10:29,100
We're giving you MP.

3018
02:10:29,340 --> 02:10:31,060
Just because you have none of that.

3019
02:10:33,240 --> 02:10:33,680
Yay!

3020
02:10:36,240 --> 02:10:36,680
Alright.

3021
02:10:36,860 --> 02:10:37,460
Let's see.

3022
02:10:37,560 --> 02:10:39,040
We have... Oh, you need a poop?

3023
02:10:39,300 --> 02:10:39,500
Okay.

3024
02:10:39,540 --> 02:10:40,280
We gotta take you outside.

3025
02:10:43,620 --> 02:10:45,560
It seems satisfied with their new strength.

3026
02:10:45,860 --> 02:10:46,840
You guys did it!

3027
02:10:46,840 --> 02:10:48,300
Don't worry.

3028
02:10:48,640 --> 02:10:49,840
Dragoon 4.

3029
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:51,260
You're gonna be so smart.

3030
02:10:52,680 --> 02:10:53,280
Guardmon.

3031
02:10:53,380 --> 02:10:53,700
Okay.

3032
02:10:53,740 --> 02:10:54,880
We don't care about Guardmon.

3033
02:10:54,980 --> 02:10:55,100
Alright.

3034
02:10:55,140 --> 02:10:55,780
Go poop now.

3035
02:10:57,420 --> 02:10:58,360
Go poop.

3036
02:11:00,800 --> 02:11:04,080
Oh, I keep forgetting there's a bathroom like next to us.

3037
02:11:04,580 --> 02:11:05,180
Alright.

3038
02:11:05,420 --> 02:11:06,020
Speed?

3039
02:11:07,480 --> 02:11:09,360
What does Guardmon mean?

3040
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:11,480
Uh...

3041
02:11:12,880 --> 02:11:14,300
I keep forgetting that.

3042
02:11:16,680 --> 02:11:17,200
Uh...

3043
02:11:18,900 --> 02:11:19,940
Speed doesn't...

3044
02:11:19,940 --> 02:11:21,080
What does...

3045
02:11:21,080 --> 02:11:22,880
What does Guardmon mean?

3046
02:11:23,640 --> 02:11:24,160
HP?

3047
02:11:25,780 --> 02:11:27,020
A bit of strength?

3048
02:11:27,280 --> 02:11:28,260
Don't need speed.

3049
02:11:28,460 --> 02:11:28,760
Okay.

3050
02:11:29,600 --> 02:11:30,800
Wisdom and MP.

3051
02:11:31,120 --> 02:11:31,620
Okay.

3052
02:11:31,880 --> 02:11:32,400
Uh...

3053
02:11:33,160 --> 02:11:34,320
We'll just give you...

3054
02:11:36,600 --> 02:11:37,720
We'll give you a defense.

3055
02:11:38,140 --> 02:11:38,420
We'll give you a defense.

3056
02:11:39,080 --> 02:11:40,960
Just because I don't know what else to do with you.

3057
02:11:41,660 --> 02:11:42,520
Dragoon 3.

3058
02:11:42,520 --> 02:11:42,840
Dragoon 3.

3059
02:11:44,500 --> 02:11:45,460
Dragoon 3.

3060
02:11:45,460 --> 02:11:45,820
Yay!

3061
02:11:46,040 --> 02:11:46,700
I've got a star!

3062
02:11:49,840 --> 02:11:50,320
Alright.

3063
02:11:50,500 --> 02:11:50,980
Nice.

3064
02:11:52,400 --> 02:11:52,880
Yeah!

3065
02:11:54,360 --> 02:11:55,420
Oh, now you wanna sleep.

3066
02:11:55,600 --> 02:11:56,040
Alright, guys.

3067
02:11:56,140 --> 02:11:57,100
We're gonna go sleep now.

3068
02:11:57,520 --> 02:11:58,240
Let's sleep.

3069
02:11:58,400 --> 02:11:59,280
Let's sleep outside.

3070
02:11:59,500 --> 02:12:00,820
We're gonna look at the stars tonight.

3071
02:12:02,700 --> 02:12:03,840
We're gonna sleep outside.

3072
02:12:03,960 --> 02:12:05,440
With all the other babies.

3073
02:12:11,360 --> 02:12:11,840
Yay!

3074
02:12:12,040 --> 02:12:12,460
Yay!

3075
02:12:13,780 --> 02:12:14,620
We recovered.

3076
02:12:15,900 --> 02:12:16,260
We've recovered everything.

3077
02:12:18,060 --> 02:12:18,580
Alright.

3078
02:12:18,700 --> 02:12:19,860
Let's grab some meat, guys.

3079
02:12:21,100 --> 02:12:21,620
Yay!

3080
02:12:22,020 --> 02:12:22,220
Alright.

3081
02:12:22,280 --> 02:12:22,920
Feeding time!

3082
02:12:23,080 --> 02:12:23,660
Feeding time!

3083
02:12:24,220 --> 02:12:26,120
Come over here, Dragoons!

3084
02:12:26,140 --> 02:12:27,020
It's time to eat!

3085
02:12:27,600 --> 02:12:28,680
It's time to eat!

3086
02:12:29,460 --> 02:12:30,500
Time to eat!

3087
02:12:31,540 --> 02:12:32,440
There you go!

3088
02:12:36,930 --> 02:12:37,450
Yay!

3089
02:12:38,430 --> 02:12:39,810
You're still hungry?

3090
02:12:39,990 --> 02:12:40,250
Okay.

3091
02:12:40,350 --> 02:12:41,110
We're giving you mushrooms.

3092
02:12:41,290 --> 02:12:42,470
You ate too much, guys.

3093
02:12:43,010 --> 02:12:44,090
It's mushroom time.

3094
02:12:44,490 --> 02:12:45,530
You gotta eat your veggies.

3095
02:12:45,530 --> 02:12:48,390
You gotta balance it with veggies and meat.

3096
02:12:49,630 --> 02:12:50,070
You gotta balance it with veggies and meat.

3097
02:12:50,070 --> 02:12:52,590
I need you to be the ultimate ultimate weight.

3098
02:12:52,810 --> 02:12:54,050
Oh, we can get more free stuff.

3099
02:12:54,290 --> 02:12:54,410
Alright.

3100
02:12:54,490 --> 02:12:55,190
Give me more free stuff.

3101
02:12:55,830 --> 02:12:56,270
Yay!

3102
02:12:56,450 --> 02:12:57,110
We got medicine!

3103
02:12:58,050 --> 02:12:58,490
Nice.

3104
02:12:58,590 --> 02:12:59,050
Alright, guys.

3105
02:12:59,330 --> 02:12:59,850
Let's go!

3106
02:13:03,330 --> 02:13:03,830
Let's go.

3107
02:13:03,930 --> 02:13:04,510
We need to...

3108
02:13:04,510 --> 02:13:06,350
We need to go find more Digimon.

3109
02:13:07,110 --> 02:13:08,650
To bring back into town.

3110
02:13:09,730 --> 02:13:11,270
And we have to make sure...

3111
02:13:11,270 --> 02:13:13,230
I need you to Digivolve into a cat.

3112
02:13:13,230 --> 02:13:14,410
That's all I want.

3113
02:13:16,290 --> 02:13:17,690
Dragoons 3, you can just like...

3114
02:13:17,690 --> 02:13:18,590
I don't know...

3115
02:13:19,130 --> 02:13:19,690
Be there.

3116
02:13:24,770 --> 02:13:27,490
You can watch your brother Digivolve into a cat.

3117
02:13:27,910 --> 02:13:28,970
You don't have to...

3118
02:13:28,970 --> 02:13:31,690
You don't have to advance from Lego if you don't want to.

3119
02:13:37,590 --> 02:13:38,070
Um...

3120
02:13:38,750 --> 02:13:39,490
Let's see.

3121
02:13:39,610 --> 02:13:40,890
We gotta go...

3122
02:13:40,890 --> 02:13:41,470
Where do I have to go?

3123
02:13:42,530 --> 02:13:43,210
Where are we?

3124
02:13:43,230 --> 02:13:43,430
Where are we?

3125
02:13:45,060 --> 02:13:45,910
We're like here.

3126
02:13:46,090 --> 02:13:47,110
To the forest path.

3127
02:13:48,090 --> 02:13:48,790
Uh...

3128
02:13:48,790 --> 02:13:49,830
Materialist spot.

3129
02:13:51,050 --> 02:13:52,210
Fishing spot.

3130
02:13:53,150 --> 02:13:55,430
Oh, we can like go talk to this one.

3131
02:13:57,020 --> 02:13:59,470
Life is pain as a Lego.

3132
02:14:03,110 --> 02:14:05,290
I love all Dragoons equally!

3133
02:14:07,370 --> 02:14:09,010
You still have potential!

3134
02:14:09,750 --> 02:14:10,710
Dragoon 3.

3135
02:14:11,810 --> 02:14:12,830
This way.

3136
02:14:13,010 --> 02:14:13,210
Alright.

3137
02:14:13,230 --> 02:14:13,710
This way.

3138
02:14:18,390 --> 02:14:18,930
Alright.

3139
02:14:19,050 --> 02:14:19,330
Alright.

3140
02:14:19,330 --> 02:14:20,530
I'm trying to figure out how to...

3141
02:14:20,530 --> 02:14:23,050
I want to know what this Digimon wants.

3142
02:14:23,250 --> 02:14:24,450
To come to my town.

3143
02:14:26,070 --> 02:14:26,910
Alright, let's go.

3144
02:14:28,010 --> 02:14:28,550
God!

3145
02:14:29,270 --> 02:14:30,570
The way you run!

3146
02:14:35,750 --> 02:14:39,070
Some fucking off-brand Lego shit right there!

3147
02:14:39,690 --> 02:14:40,230
...

3148
02:14:43,290 --> 02:14:45,590
I love all my Digimon equally.

3149
02:14:46,450 --> 02:14:46,890
...

3150
02:14:48,110 --> 02:14:48,550
Alright.

3151
02:14:49,730 --> 02:14:51,590
Yes, I've come at a good time!

3152
02:14:51,750 --> 02:14:52,610
I need help with something!

3153
02:14:53,070 --> 02:14:55,990
I'm looking for fertilizer to help me make some tasty meat.

3154
02:14:56,210 --> 02:14:57,470
But I'm having a little trouble.

3155
02:14:57,570 --> 02:14:58,670
That's where you come from.

3156
02:14:59,450 --> 02:15:00,190
No problem.

3157
02:15:00,510 --> 02:15:01,550
Thanks, you're the best!

3158
02:15:02,030 --> 02:15:06,070
Bring me a cheerful apple, a digi stalk, and some salty fruit.

3159
02:15:06,330 --> 02:15:07,530
We need to find them.

3160
02:15:07,550 --> 02:15:07,970
Got it?

3161
02:15:07,970 --> 02:15:09,070
Okay.

3162
02:15:09,310 --> 02:15:10,210
Salty fruit.

3163
02:15:10,590 --> 02:15:12,070
Where do I get salty fruit?

3164
02:15:12,890 --> 02:15:15,250
I don't think I've ever seen a salty fruit before.

3165
02:15:16,810 --> 02:15:18,310
Just admit that you hate us?

3166
02:15:18,390 --> 02:15:19,250
I don't!

3167
02:15:20,370 --> 02:15:21,770
I love Dragon 4!

3168
02:15:22,690 --> 02:15:23,250
...

3169
02:15:23,250 --> 02:15:23,850
...

3170
02:15:27,310 --> 02:15:29,250
I like how we go into this ring.

3171
02:15:29,650 --> 02:15:30,190
...

3172
02:15:30,190 --> 02:15:30,730
Nice one!

3173
02:15:31,170 --> 02:15:31,890
That's the way!

3174
02:15:31,890 --> 02:15:32,410
Nice.

3175
02:15:32,510 --> 02:15:33,590
Stronger power level.

3176
02:15:33,870 --> 02:15:34,570
That's good!

3177
02:15:35,150 --> 02:15:37,530
... Oh my god!

3178
02:15:37,550 --> 02:15:37,730
See?

3179
02:15:37,970 --> 02:15:39,590
At least Dragon 4 hubs!

3180
02:15:39,990 --> 02:15:40,590
...

3181
02:15:43,270 --> 02:15:45,770
Wait a minute...

3182
02:15:45,770 --> 02:15:47,210
That's the way!

3183
02:15:47,270 --> 02:15:48,750
Come on, Dragon 4!

3184
02:15:49,210 --> 02:15:51,030
Make Mommy proud!

3185
02:15:51,670 --> 02:15:52,650
Go, 4!

3186
02:15:52,710 --> 02:15:53,010
Go!

3187
02:15:54,930 --> 02:15:55,610
3.

3188
02:15:55,690 --> 02:15:56,950
Don't take your brother's spotlight.

3189
02:15:57,690 --> 02:15:58,030
3.

3190
02:15:58,270 --> 02:16:01,430
Let your younger brother have the spotlight.

3191
02:16:01,530 --> 02:16:01,810
...

3192
02:16:01,810 --> 02:16:01,810
2.

3193
02:16:01,930 --> 02:16:02,190
3.

3194
02:16:03,470 --> 02:16:04,150
4!

3195
02:16:04,350 --> 02:16:05,250
You did it!

3196
02:16:05,670 --> 02:16:06,250
4!

3197
02:16:07,990 --> 02:16:08,810
Oh my!

3198
02:16:10,290 --> 02:16:11,170
You did amazing!

3199
02:16:13,510 --> 02:16:14,070
...

3200
02:16:15,750 --> 02:16:16,310
...

3201
02:16:17,810 --> 02:16:18,370
...

3202
02:16:18,370 --> 02:16:18,850
...

3203
02:16:19,950 --> 02:16:22,530
There are 4 systems and tamer skills.

3204
02:16:23,010 --> 02:16:23,570
...

3205
02:16:24,870 --> 02:16:27,750
And 3 to 5 subsystems within these.

3206
02:16:27,890 --> 02:16:29,190
Switch between these systems.

3207
02:16:29,510 --> 02:16:29,810
Oh!

3208
02:16:29,910 --> 02:16:31,430
Press A to look for subsystems.

3209
02:16:31,970 --> 02:16:34,210
Oh my god, this is a lot more elaborate than I expected.

3210
02:16:34,970 --> 02:16:35,530
...

3211
02:16:36,190 --> 02:16:36,750
Um...

3212
02:16:36,750 --> 02:16:44,050
Getting a skill is not possible until the skills before that one have been acquired.

3213
02:16:44,310 --> 02:16:47,010
Press A on the skill panel to acquire the skills.

3214
02:16:47,290 --> 02:16:47,430
Oh!

3215
02:16:47,670 --> 02:16:48,850
What the heck?

3216
02:16:49,630 --> 02:16:50,790
What the fuck?

3217
02:16:51,210 --> 02:16:51,490
...

3218
02:16:52,570 --> 02:16:54,690
This is like so complicated.

3219
02:16:55,150 --> 02:16:55,550
What's this?

3220
02:16:56,530 --> 02:16:58,850
Small bonus during the bond boost.

3221
02:16:59,270 --> 02:16:59,830
Oh!

3222
02:17:00,010 --> 02:17:02,630
It's treat type, life type, reverse type.

3223
02:17:03,010 --> 02:17:06,010
Boost parameter inheritance by 1 level.

3224
02:17:06,010 --> 02:17:06,230
Oh!

3225
02:17:06,330 --> 02:17:07,010
I would like that.

3226
02:17:07,210 --> 02:17:07,330
Yeah.

3227
02:17:08,850 --> 02:17:09,250
Uh...

3228
02:17:09,250 --> 02:17:12,250
If you are a tamer in a lower region, you will definitely be able to acquire all skills.

3229
02:17:12,350 --> 02:17:13,610
So learn the ones you need.

3230
02:17:14,410 --> 02:17:14,810
Okay.

3231
02:17:15,230 --> 02:17:16,530
I really want to learn this one.

3232
02:17:16,810 --> 02:17:18,250
What's the best one to have?

3233
02:17:20,250 --> 02:17:20,650
Um...

3234
02:17:20,650 --> 02:17:22,670
There are so many skill sets.

3235
02:17:23,250 --> 02:17:25,990
Yeah, I felt like the egg would be the best because...

3236
02:17:26,430 --> 02:17:26,830
Uh...

3237
02:17:28,330 --> 02:17:28,730
Um...

3238
02:17:29,390 --> 02:17:31,070
Walker type for free heal?

3239
02:17:31,610 --> 02:17:32,770
Where's the free heal?

3240
02:17:33,590 --> 02:17:34,330
Oh, here!

3241
02:17:34,870 --> 02:17:35,310
...

3242
02:17:36,870 --> 02:17:38,190
Heal while running is good.

3243
02:17:38,310 --> 02:17:39,390
Okay, we'll get that one next.

3244
02:17:42,570 --> 02:17:43,010
Um...

3245
02:17:44,670 --> 02:17:45,550
Let's see...

3246
02:17:46,810 --> 02:17:47,250
History...

3247
02:17:47,250 --> 02:17:48,410
Have you unlocked it yet?

3248
02:17:48,910 --> 02:17:51,190
Okay, we still have the bonds for it.

3249
02:17:52,170 --> 02:17:52,610
Uh...

3250
02:17:52,610 --> 02:17:54,890
But other than that, we don't really have anything else.

3251
02:17:55,470 --> 02:17:57,610
What the fuck is Gajramon?

3252
02:17:58,130 --> 02:17:58,570
Good.

3253
02:18:00,230 --> 02:18:01,430
Okay, where do we need to go?

3254
02:18:03,250 --> 02:18:04,690
Okay, I want to go this way.

3255
02:18:05,390 --> 02:18:06,850
I think there might be...

3256
02:18:06,850 --> 02:18:08,250
We might be able to find the fruit here.

3257
02:18:09,270 --> 02:18:10,610
Defend order is good.

3258
02:18:11,570 --> 02:18:12,530
Defend... um...

3259
02:18:12,530 --> 02:18:13,030
Walker.

3260
02:18:13,230 --> 02:18:14,090
Okay, we'll get Walker.

3261
02:18:14,270 --> 02:18:15,190
What the fuck?

3262
02:18:15,370 --> 02:18:16,270
Oh, it's...

3263
02:18:16,270 --> 02:18:17,610
Uh, what's your name?

3264
02:18:18,010 --> 02:18:18,810
It's Vemon!

3265
02:18:19,990 --> 02:18:21,530
The blockhead Togmon.

3266
02:18:22,070 --> 02:18:24,890
Even though my special move is so cool and strong...

3267
02:18:24,890 --> 02:18:26,250
I'll never go back there.

3268
02:18:26,450 --> 02:18:26,850
Hmph!

3269
02:18:27,470 --> 02:18:28,130
What's this?

3270
02:18:28,270 --> 02:18:29,090
Are you a human?

3271
02:18:29,650 --> 02:18:31,570
What are you doing in a place like this?

3272
02:18:32,770 --> 02:18:34,110
Is this your first time here?

3273
02:18:34,890 --> 02:18:35,890
Wait, there's like...

3274
02:18:35,890 --> 02:18:37,470
fucking servers here.

3275
02:18:37,770 --> 02:18:39,530
Why are there servers in my desert?

3276
02:18:39,930 --> 02:18:40,610
Hahahaha!

3277
02:18:43,490 --> 02:18:45,510
This is server desert.

3278
02:18:46,130 --> 02:18:52,650
A place devoid of vegetation after intense heat from old servers withered all the plants away.

3279
02:18:52,870 --> 02:18:53,750
Oh, that's clever.

3280
02:18:56,350 --> 02:18:57,770
This is my space.

3281
02:18:58,230 --> 02:18:58,910
Hahahaha!

3282
02:19:00,550 --> 02:19:01,230
This is my space.

3283
02:19:01,230 --> 02:19:01,310
Hahahaha!

3284
02:19:03,850 --> 02:19:08,410
The old break room called Oasis has a vending machine and a toilet.

3285
02:19:08,650 --> 02:19:11,770
Out here, a tower of new type servers lies deep within.

3286
02:19:12,410 --> 02:19:12,930
Um...

3287
02:19:12,930 --> 02:19:16,830
And out west, a ways to reach wasteland.

3288
02:19:16,950 --> 02:19:21,050
South of here lies another area called Logic Volcano.

3289
02:19:22,630 --> 02:19:23,150
Um...

3290
02:19:23,150 --> 02:19:26,610
But beware, the Digimon out there are stronger than the ones you'll face in Nine Plains.

3291
02:19:26,770 --> 02:19:27,910
Are you coming home with us?

3292
02:19:30,230 --> 02:19:30,790
That...

3293
02:19:30,790 --> 02:19:31,250
That...

3294
02:19:31,250 --> 02:19:33,250
Oh wait, are you telling me this again?

3295
02:19:33,390 --> 02:19:35,490
Oh wait, oh, did he introduce this again?

3296
02:19:39,840 --> 02:19:42,140
Cryptomine killed the planets.

3297
02:19:42,620 --> 02:19:43,180
Cryptomine killed the planets.

3298
02:19:43,180 --> 02:19:43,580
Plants.

3299
02:19:43,700 --> 02:19:44,640
Oh my god.

3300
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:45,400
Hahahaha!

3301
02:19:47,680 --> 02:19:53,060
What was that really intense game that's known to like be used to test PCs?

3302
02:19:53,920 --> 02:19:59,320
I remember you guys wanted me to try it out because the game was like Oh no, you guys need to use the bathroom.

3303
02:19:59,760 --> 02:20:00,360
You need to go back.

3304
02:20:01,280 --> 02:20:01,840
No!

3305
02:20:02,180 --> 02:20:03,560
Oh my god!

3306
02:20:03,700 --> 02:20:06,340
I wanted to get to the bathroom!

3307
02:20:06,800 --> 02:20:07,760
Crisis, yeah.

3308
02:20:07,900 --> 02:20:11,600
This is all the PCs that are trying to run Crisis right now.

3309
02:20:11,900 --> 02:20:12,140
Hahaha!

3310
02:20:13,500 --> 02:20:13,780
Hahaha!

3311
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:17,240
Alright, keep going!

3312
02:20:17,440 --> 02:20:18,260
Keep going guys!

3313
02:20:18,700 --> 02:20:19,860
Dragoons, keep fighting!

3314
02:20:21,720 --> 02:20:23,640
What level are you guys anyway?

3315
02:20:24,840 --> 02:20:25,680
Oh no.

3316
02:20:25,800 --> 02:20:27,600
Oh no, your brother is always getting hurt!

3317
02:20:27,740 --> 02:20:28,920
You have to help him!

3318
02:20:29,760 --> 02:20:30,400
Let's go!

3319
02:20:30,800 --> 02:20:33,300
Your brother is always getting hurt, guys!

3320
02:20:36,180 --> 02:20:37,300
Help your brother!

3321
02:20:38,820 --> 02:20:39,740
Help him!

3322
02:20:39,780 --> 02:20:41,960
Dragoons, help your younger brother!

3323
02:20:43,380 --> 02:20:44,580
He needs help!

3324
02:20:45,720 --> 02:20:46,320
He needs help!

3325
02:20:47,100 --> 02:20:47,680
Hahaha!

3326
02:20:49,580 --> 02:20:50,160
Hahaha!

3327
02:20:50,860 --> 02:20:56,000
Alright, we gotta We gotta take you to the bathroom.

3328
02:20:56,200 --> 02:20:57,420
I'm heading there, I'm heading there guys!

3329
02:20:57,420 --> 02:20:58,200
Give me a sec!

3330
02:20:58,880 --> 02:21:01,580
We're getting there as fast as our little feets can take us!

3331
02:21:01,840 --> 02:21:02,840
Little feetsies!

3332
02:21:03,520 --> 02:21:04,640
It's right over there!

3333
02:21:07,140 --> 02:21:08,180
I don't know why.

3334
02:21:08,580 --> 02:21:09,240
I don't know why!

3335
02:21:09,460 --> 02:21:11,820
Dragoons 3, why don't you like your younger brother?

3336
02:21:13,380 --> 02:21:17,240
You're older, so you have the experience to teach him!

3337
02:21:17,380 --> 02:21:18,420
You gotta take care of him!

3338
02:21:19,620 --> 02:21:21,600
You guys have shared the same blood!

3339
02:21:24,020 --> 02:21:26,620
Nononononono He's faster than me!

3340
02:21:26,700 --> 02:21:27,140
Nonononono!

3341
02:21:27,420 --> 02:21:28,780
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3342
02:21:28,940 --> 02:21:29,900
No, no, no, no, no, no.

3343
02:21:29,900 --> 02:21:31,660
I'm not gonna waste my porta-potty.

3344
02:21:31,720 --> 02:21:33,720
I'm not, I'm not gonna waste...

3345
02:21:33,720 --> 02:21:36,440
I would rather you poop on the floor then use my porta-potty.

3346
02:21:36,600 --> 02:21:38,480
I gotta, I gotta save up.

3347
02:21:42,180 --> 02:21:44,020
The same DigiBlood.

3348
02:21:47,740 --> 02:21:48,160
155.

3349
02:21:48,560 --> 02:21:48,980
Jesus.

3350
02:21:49,500 --> 02:21:51,280
Our bond is like half.

3351
02:21:55,240 --> 02:21:55,660
Alright.

3352
02:21:55,660 --> 02:21:56,520
Let's go this way.

3353
02:21:57,740 --> 02:21:59,480
We gotta run faster than...

3354
02:21:59,480 --> 02:22:01,180
Faster than these guys.

3355
02:22:02,520 --> 02:22:04,060
Like these guys are...

3356
02:22:04,060 --> 02:22:05,500
Are so strong.

3357
02:22:05,740 --> 02:22:06,800
Oh my god, they're level 3.

3358
02:22:07,520 --> 02:22:08,620
They're level 3.

3359
02:22:09,280 --> 02:22:11,020
There's so many of them too.

3360
02:22:11,180 --> 02:22:12,860
We gotta run past all of them.

3361
02:22:14,480 --> 02:22:15,000
Alright.

3362
02:22:15,480 --> 02:22:17,360
I don't hate you guys.

3363
02:22:18,360 --> 02:22:19,600
You're all equal.

3364
02:22:20,300 --> 02:22:21,560
Oh my god.

3365
02:22:21,600 --> 02:22:21,760
Oh!

3366
02:22:23,180 --> 02:22:24,340
Oh my god, oh my god.

3367
02:22:24,400 --> 02:22:24,620
No!

3368
02:22:26,520 --> 02:22:27,700
God damn it.

3369
02:22:27,800 --> 02:22:29,580
Oh god, I need to use items.

3370
02:22:30,600 --> 02:22:31,100
Uh...

3371
02:22:31,960 --> 02:22:32,600
Let's see.

3372
02:22:32,800 --> 02:22:33,580
Oh, I have a lot more.

3373
02:22:33,940 --> 02:22:35,140
Good, I still have a lot more.

3374
02:22:35,880 --> 02:22:37,720
Don't even take any damage.

3375
02:22:38,900 --> 02:22:39,580
Dragoon 3.

3376
02:22:40,760 --> 02:22:41,600
Alright, nice.

3377
02:22:42,900 --> 02:22:43,580
Come on.

3378
02:22:43,640 --> 02:22:44,640
Come on, you guys got this.

3379
02:22:45,920 --> 02:22:46,720
Keep fighting.

3380
02:22:48,740 --> 02:22:50,100
I'm cheering you guys on.

3381
02:22:50,520 --> 02:22:51,240
We're together.

3382
02:22:51,340 --> 02:22:52,340
Oh no.

3383
02:22:52,840 --> 02:22:53,340
What?

3384
02:22:54,500 --> 02:22:55,380
Dragoon 4.

3385
02:22:55,380 --> 02:22:56,720
How could you miss?

3386
02:23:01,980 --> 02:23:02,840
Dragoon 4.

3387
02:23:02,900 --> 02:23:03,100
Dragoon 4, please.

3388
02:23:09,380 --> 02:23:11,740
Dragoon 3, help your little brother out.

3389
02:23:12,220 --> 02:23:13,260
He can't aim.

3390
02:23:14,440 --> 02:23:17,140
He doesn't have the hand-eye coordination.

3391
02:23:19,720 --> 02:23:21,600
He's trying his best.

3392
02:23:25,500 --> 02:23:27,180
Bro-cat aim.

3393
02:23:29,700 --> 02:23:30,360
Yay!

3394
02:23:32,360 --> 02:23:34,960
You did it, Dragoon 3!

3395
02:23:36,040 --> 02:23:37,440
We have to describe items?

3396
02:23:38,720 --> 02:23:40,320
Return to town.

3397
02:23:41,360 --> 02:23:42,420
Wisdom chip.

3398
02:23:42,680 --> 02:23:44,740
Oh wait, I can like increase your...

3399
02:23:44,740 --> 02:23:45,500
your...

3400
02:23:46,350 --> 02:23:47,640
I can increase you guys.

3401
02:23:48,080 --> 02:23:50,060
Oh no, I don't know what to throw away.

3402
02:23:50,580 --> 02:23:52,120
Oh, this is going to be difficult.

3403
02:23:53,340 --> 02:23:53,800
Ooh.

3404
02:23:54,500 --> 02:23:56,160
What do I throw away?

3405
02:23:58,560 --> 02:24:00,260
Get rid of the autopilot.

3406
02:24:00,340 --> 02:24:01,140
Do we not need that?

3407
02:24:08,860 --> 02:24:09,320
Alright.

3408
02:24:10,980 --> 02:24:11,440
Discard.

3409
02:24:13,680 --> 02:24:14,400
Alright, guys.

3410
02:24:14,960 --> 02:24:20,120
Apparently, I didn't even realize I had items that can increase your stats.

3411
02:24:20,200 --> 02:24:22,040
So I don't have to train you guys anymore.

3412
02:24:22,500 --> 02:24:24,020
Alright, which one is it?

3413
02:24:24,100 --> 02:24:27,620
Which one do I need to give Dragoon 4?

3414
02:24:27,620 --> 02:24:29,280
For Gatomon.

3415
02:24:34,460 --> 02:24:35,500
What do I need?

3416
02:24:36,580 --> 02:24:38,640
Give all wisdom and HP.

3417
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:39,720
Okay, wisdom.

3418
02:24:40,360 --> 02:24:40,940
Alright.

3419
02:24:42,160 --> 02:24:43,760
Oh, you both get it?

3420
02:24:44,380 --> 02:24:45,480
God, I didn't...

3421
02:24:45,480 --> 02:24:46,720
You're not supposed to be smarter.

3422
02:24:48,200 --> 02:24:49,580
Oh, just...

3423
02:24:49,580 --> 02:24:50,420
Okay, just you.

3424
02:24:50,560 --> 02:24:51,120
Okay, nice.

3425
02:24:51,380 --> 02:24:52,560
Alright, I figured it out.

3426
02:24:52,800 --> 02:24:53,160
Alright.

3427
02:24:53,320 --> 02:24:54,280
MP as well.

3428
02:24:54,780 --> 02:24:56,140
Wisdom and MP.

3429
02:24:56,320 --> 02:24:57,420
Okay, here you go.

3430
02:24:57,920 --> 02:24:59,080
You deserve this.

3431
02:24:59,860 --> 02:25:00,540
Yay!

3432
02:25:02,840 --> 02:25:03,760
Don't worry.

3433
02:25:03,900 --> 02:25:04,900
You deserve this.

3434
02:25:05,220 --> 02:25:06,120
Good job.

3435
02:25:06,560 --> 02:25:08,420
Good job, Dragoon 4.

3436
02:25:09,080 --> 02:25:10,220
Alright, nice.

3437
02:25:10,660 --> 02:25:11,340
Alright.

3438
02:25:12,040 --> 02:25:12,380
No!

3439
02:25:12,760 --> 02:25:14,340
What's the way did he come from?

3440
02:25:14,640 --> 02:25:15,100
Wait!

3441
02:25:15,620 --> 02:25:17,380
Keep your eyes open.

3442
02:25:21,020 --> 02:25:22,260
Where the fuck...

3443
02:25:22,680 --> 02:25:23,200
Please!

3444
02:25:23,240 --> 02:25:25,360
What gets out of you aim?

3445
02:25:26,180 --> 02:25:29,060
I raised you guys to be aimers.

3446
02:25:29,840 --> 02:25:30,960
I raised...

3447
02:25:33,640 --> 02:25:36,860
I raised you guys to be able to aim.

3448
02:25:37,260 --> 02:25:38,620
I don't understand.

3449
02:25:43,940 --> 02:25:44,500
Alright.

3450
02:25:45,060 --> 02:25:45,820
Come on.

3451
02:25:46,060 --> 02:25:47,420
Come on, Dragoon 3.

3452
02:25:48,240 --> 02:25:49,580
Okay, I'm gonna use this.

3453
02:25:50,500 --> 02:25:51,060
Okay.

3454
02:25:51,480 --> 02:25:52,540
We should be able...

3455
02:25:52,540 --> 02:25:53,880
That should be like one hit for him.

3456
02:25:54,320 --> 02:25:55,620
It did not register?

3457
02:25:57,460 --> 02:25:58,120
Oh, wait.

3458
02:25:58,120 --> 02:25:58,760
I used agitation.

3459
02:25:58,760 --> 02:25:59,040
No.

3460
02:25:59,040 --> 02:25:59,440
Okay.

3461
02:25:59,740 --> 02:26:00,180
There we go.

3462
02:26:00,240 --> 02:26:00,520
Blizzard.

3463
02:26:01,600 --> 02:26:02,440
This should do it.

3464
02:26:03,760 --> 02:26:06,220
Brother ain't that smart even with all...

3465
02:26:07,940 --> 02:26:10,560
No, I mean, thank you for the super chat.

3466
02:26:10,660 --> 02:26:10,860
Thank you.

3467
02:26:10,980 --> 02:26:11,400
Thank you.

3468
02:26:14,260 --> 02:26:14,700
Alright.

3469
02:26:15,060 --> 02:26:15,500
Nice.

3470
02:26:15,600 --> 02:26:15,800
Okay.

3471
02:26:15,880 --> 02:26:16,760
Now I can talk.

3472
02:26:16,900 --> 02:26:17,280
Please.

3473
02:26:17,360 --> 02:26:18,540
I just want to talk to him.

3474
02:26:20,540 --> 02:26:21,360
It's no good.

3475
02:26:21,500 --> 02:26:22,600
I can't think of anything.

3476
02:26:23,100 --> 02:26:25,940
I may be weak, but I want to help people.

3477
02:26:26,060 --> 02:26:28,680
The problem is my only skill is making this thread.

3478
02:26:28,800 --> 02:26:29,020
I can't think of anything.

3479
02:26:29,020 --> 02:26:31,660
I'm confident in strength, but what can I use it for?

3480
02:26:32,820 --> 02:26:33,820
A fishing line.

3481
02:26:34,880 --> 02:26:35,460
Fishing line.

3482
02:26:35,620 --> 02:26:36,560
What a great idea.

3483
02:26:36,960 --> 02:26:38,660
Even I could make something like that.

3484
02:26:38,800 --> 02:26:40,380
Oh, this is where we get the fishing rod.

3485
02:26:41,320 --> 02:26:43,240
I don't have anything I could use as a fishing rod.

3486
02:26:43,440 --> 02:26:44,420
Can you help me find a stick?

3487
02:26:44,800 --> 02:26:45,160
Sure.

3488
02:26:46,260 --> 02:26:47,700
I wonder if I could use it as a rod.

3489
02:26:47,780 --> 02:26:48,280
Bring it here.

3490
02:26:48,360 --> 02:26:48,980
I'm counting on you.

3491
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:49,840
How am I gonna get a stick?

3492
02:26:50,380 --> 02:26:50,940
Oh, God.

3493
02:26:51,040 --> 02:26:51,340
Oh, God.

3494
02:26:51,360 --> 02:26:51,780
Leave me alone.

3495
02:26:51,940 --> 02:26:52,480
Leave me alone.

3496
02:26:52,660 --> 02:26:53,520
Please leave me alone.

3497
02:26:53,900 --> 02:26:54,260
Please.

3498
02:26:54,580 --> 02:26:55,600
Please leave me alone.

3499
02:26:56,280 --> 02:26:56,640
Please.

3500
02:26:56,720 --> 02:26:58,120
I need to go find a stick.

3501
02:26:58,640 --> 02:26:59,000
I need to go find a stick.

3502
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:00,600
Wait, do I have enough items?

3503
02:27:01,180 --> 02:27:03,080
I should have enough items to feed them, right?

3504
02:27:03,260 --> 02:27:04,300
I need like five.

3505
02:27:04,960 --> 02:27:06,320
No, I only have two.

3506
02:27:07,680 --> 02:27:11,740
I didn't kill enough Digimon for more of the mushrooms.

3507
02:27:12,300 --> 02:27:12,920
Oh, no.

3508
02:27:13,020 --> 02:27:13,540
Oh, no.

3509
02:27:13,900 --> 02:27:14,680
Oh, no.

3510
02:27:14,780 --> 02:27:15,840
Oh, no.

3511
02:27:16,700 --> 02:27:17,520
Oh, no.

3512
02:27:17,940 --> 02:27:18,360
Oh, no.

3513
02:27:18,360 --> 02:27:18,520
Oh, no.

3514
02:27:18,560 --> 02:27:19,060
I'm gonna run away.

3515
02:27:19,960 --> 02:27:21,400
Yeah, let me grab this first.

3516
02:27:21,740 --> 02:27:22,140
Nice.

3517
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:29,380
I'm gonna go back to the gaming.

3518
02:27:32,100 --> 02:27:32,660
Okay.

3519
02:27:33,860 --> 02:27:41,800
I need to go back to give the food to the... give food to the one, the other Digimon.

3520
02:27:43,200 --> 02:27:45,280
I'm for the chooks.

3521
02:27:47,400 --> 02:27:48,900
All right, here we go.

3522
02:27:49,480 --> 02:27:52,360
God, I just want to evolve you into Gatomon.

3523
02:27:52,860 --> 02:27:54,780
I can't believe it.

3524
02:27:55,600 --> 02:27:56,480
No, please.

3525
02:27:56,860 --> 02:27:57,420
No.

3526
02:27:58,040 --> 02:27:58,760
All right.

3527
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:00,020
I missed the stick.

3528
02:28:00,140 --> 02:28:00,440
No.

3529
02:28:00,900 --> 02:28:01,460
It's okay.

3530
02:28:01,660 --> 02:28:02,120
It's okay.

3531
02:28:02,200 --> 02:28:03,240
We have to go this way anyway.

3532
02:28:03,700 --> 02:28:04,220
It's okay.

3533
02:28:04,300 --> 02:28:05,180
Run, run, run.

3534
02:28:05,680 --> 02:28:07,280
No, we have to go this way anyway.

3535
02:28:07,380 --> 02:28:07,880
That's fine.

3536
02:28:08,800 --> 02:28:09,720
Where is he?

3537
02:28:10,520 --> 02:28:11,800
Where's the quest line for this?

3538
02:28:12,040 --> 02:28:13,040
Oh, it's over there.

3539
02:28:13,040 --> 02:28:14,240
I went around the wrong way.

3540
02:28:14,680 --> 02:28:15,660
It's over there.

3541
02:28:16,420 --> 02:28:16,920
Don't worry.

3542
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:17,580
We're heading there.

3543
02:28:18,960 --> 02:28:19,980
Run, run, run.

3544
02:28:22,160 --> 02:28:22,560
Okay.

3545
02:28:23,040 --> 02:28:23,580
Don't worry.

3546
02:28:23,640 --> 02:28:25,080
We'll find another stick, guys.

3547
02:28:25,280 --> 02:28:26,200
We can always find...

3548
02:28:26,200 --> 02:28:27,080
There's trees everywhere.

3549
02:28:27,440 --> 02:28:28,980
Surely one of them can be a stick.

3550
02:28:28,980 --> 02:28:29,980
All right.

3551
02:28:31,020 --> 02:28:31,240
Nice.

3552
02:28:32,660 --> 02:28:33,380
All right.

3553
02:28:33,380 --> 02:28:33,800
Here we go.

3554
02:28:34,700 --> 02:28:35,260
Hello.

3555
02:28:35,580 --> 02:28:36,640
Hello, plant lady.

3556
02:28:37,660 --> 02:28:38,220
Yes.

3557
02:28:38,720 --> 02:28:39,720
I got everything.

3558
02:28:43,220 --> 02:28:43,780
Yay!

3559
02:28:44,640 --> 02:28:46,100
Powmon joined the city.

3560
02:28:47,940 --> 02:28:48,500
Okay.

3561
02:28:48,600 --> 02:28:49,720
We can find another stick.

3562
02:28:50,020 --> 02:28:51,940
There has to be another stick over there.

3563
02:28:52,760 --> 02:28:53,820
There's no way.

3564
02:28:55,060 --> 02:28:56,840
Something's here or something's there.

3565
02:28:57,480 --> 02:28:58,040
Really?

3566
02:28:58,160 --> 02:28:58,600
Here we go.

3567
02:28:58,600 --> 02:28:58,960
One.

3568
02:28:58,960 --> 02:28:59,980
I don't think I see anything here.

3569
02:29:00,760 --> 02:29:01,040
Okay.

3570
02:29:01,040 --> 02:29:01,780
We'll go through...

3571
02:29:01,780 --> 02:29:02,420
Is it this way?

3572
02:29:02,500 --> 02:29:02,660
No.

3573
02:29:02,780 --> 02:29:03,480
It was like...

3574
02:29:03,480 --> 02:29:04,120
Oh my God.

3575
02:29:04,140 --> 02:29:04,340
I'm ready.

3576
02:29:04,460 --> 02:29:05,100
How am I lost?

3577
02:29:05,700 --> 02:29:06,280
How am I...

3578
02:29:08,740 --> 02:29:11,020
Oh, it's this way.

3579
02:29:11,060 --> 02:29:11,260
Okay.

3580
02:29:11,340 --> 02:29:13,040
I was going to say, how am I...

3581
02:29:13,560 --> 02:29:14,680
How am I lost?

3582
02:29:14,860 --> 02:29:16,400
Is this only like...

3583
02:29:16,940 --> 02:29:18,740
How did it caught up to me?

3584
02:29:20,580 --> 02:29:21,640
Oh my God.

3585
02:29:21,700 --> 02:29:23,200
Please leave me alone.

3586
02:29:26,140 --> 02:29:27,260
Leave us alone.

3587
02:29:27,840 --> 02:29:28,840
I'm so sorry.

3588
02:29:28,840 --> 02:29:28,940
I'm so sorry.

3589
02:29:30,840 --> 02:29:31,280
Okay.

3590
02:29:31,480 --> 02:29:31,900
It's working.

3591
02:29:31,980 --> 02:29:32,420
It's working.

3592
02:29:32,420 --> 02:29:32,860
Way to go!

3593
02:29:33,060 --> 02:29:35,000
I wish I could run away faster, dude.

3594
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:35,980
That's all I wish for.

3595
02:29:36,260 --> 02:29:36,420
Alright.

3596
02:29:36,840 --> 02:29:37,600
Use your...

3597
02:29:37,600 --> 02:29:37,620
Oh.

3598
02:29:37,760 --> 02:29:38,660
I shouldn't have done that.

3599
02:29:39,040 --> 02:29:39,480
Bigay!

3600
02:29:39,760 --> 02:29:40,420
Oh, no.

3601
02:29:40,520 --> 02:29:40,920
Oh, no.

3602
02:29:40,960 --> 02:29:41,180
No!

3603
02:29:41,560 --> 02:29:41,740
No!!

3604
02:29:41,740 --> 02:29:42,460
Your brother!!

3605
02:29:44,500 --> 02:29:45,180
Oh, No.

3606
02:29:47,480 --> 02:29:47,920
Live!

3607
02:29:48,760 --> 02:29:49,700
Here you go.

3608
02:29:50,760 --> 02:29:51,200
Live!!

3609
02:29:52,100 --> 02:29:56,120
Why do you always let your brother die!?

3610
02:29:56,120 --> 02:29:56,500
Okay.

3611
02:29:57,260 --> 02:29:57,980
That's the way.

3612
02:29:57,980 --> 02:30:03,700
Why do you never... I keep forgetting how low HP he is!

3613
02:30:07,180 --> 02:30:08,160
Younger brother!

3614
02:30:08,680 --> 02:30:10,800
You gotta help your younger brother!

3615
02:30:10,940 --> 02:30:12,180
Help your younger brother!

3616
02:30:12,900 --> 02:30:13,620
Go!

3617
02:30:15,220 --> 02:30:16,720
No MP.

3618
02:30:18,820 --> 02:30:21,800
Why do you always run out of MP?

3619
02:30:21,800 --> 02:30:21,880
MP!

3620
02:30:22,720 --> 02:30:26,650
Oh my god.

3621
02:30:27,770 --> 02:30:29,510
Dragon 4, you did great.

3622
02:30:29,870 --> 02:30:31,610
Dragon 3, you were there.

3623
02:30:40,750 --> 02:30:42,850
Oh, we got Greymon.

3624
02:30:42,910 --> 02:30:43,730
What's TF?

3625
02:30:45,290 --> 02:30:46,690
What the fuck is TF?

3626
02:30:46,810 --> 02:30:48,130
We got the TF part.

3627
02:30:49,370 --> 02:30:49,690
Okay.

3628
02:30:50,990 --> 02:30:53,010
And then, let's see...

3629
02:30:53,650 --> 02:30:54,070
I don't even know.

3630
02:30:54,470 --> 02:30:57,070
I hope we get there for like the other stuff.

3631
02:30:57,950 --> 02:30:59,350
Oh, training failure?

3632
02:31:02,010 --> 02:31:02,970
You failed?

3633
02:31:03,630 --> 02:31:04,710
How did you fail?

3634
02:31:07,970 --> 02:31:09,450
How did you fail training?

3635
02:31:12,190 --> 02:31:13,270
How the fuck...

3636
02:31:17,030 --> 02:31:19,470
I didn't even let you guys poop on the floor.

3637
02:31:19,530 --> 02:31:21,370
When did you guys poop on the floor?

3638
02:31:29,150 --> 02:31:30,730
Oh, the mistakes!

3639
02:31:31,270 --> 02:31:31,510
Oh!

3640
02:31:34,410 --> 02:31:35,590
Oh, I see.

3641
02:31:35,890 --> 02:31:36,830
I see.

3642
02:31:37,070 --> 02:31:38,410
You don't hit the icons.

3643
02:31:38,790 --> 02:31:39,310
Okay.

3644
02:31:40,010 --> 02:31:42,230
Alright, we're gonna go back.

3645
02:31:43,450 --> 02:31:45,210
Okay, we're gonna give you guys food, actually.

3646
02:31:45,830 --> 02:31:47,370
We're gonna make sure you guys have food.

3647
02:31:50,090 --> 02:31:50,610
Uh...

3648
02:31:51,350 --> 02:31:53,310
Alright, I'm gonna give you guys...

3649
02:31:54,350 --> 02:31:55,770
I'm gonna give you guys regular meat.

3650
02:31:56,650 --> 02:31:57,730
And then... Oh, wait.

3651
02:31:57,770 --> 02:31:58,830
I just fed one of you guys.

3652
02:31:58,970 --> 02:31:59,210
Oops.

3653
02:32:01,430 --> 02:32:01,910
Sorry.

3654
02:32:02,790 --> 02:32:04,010
You need food too.

3655
02:32:04,110 --> 02:32:04,570
Give me...

3656
02:32:07,150 --> 02:32:07,630
Sorry.

3657
02:32:07,630 --> 02:32:09,310
I only fed one of you.

3658
02:32:09,390 --> 02:32:10,130
Don't worry.

3659
02:32:10,230 --> 02:32:10,710
Here you go.

3660
02:32:13,870 --> 02:32:16,130
I almost didn't feed you too.

3661
02:32:17,130 --> 02:32:18,090
I don't...

3662
02:32:18,090 --> 02:32:19,310
I don't...

3663
02:32:20,930 --> 02:32:22,330
Alright, let's go back.

3664
02:32:22,330 --> 02:32:23,430
It's time to train.

3665
02:32:23,990 --> 02:32:25,350
It's time to train again.

3666
02:32:27,990 --> 02:32:28,470
Yay!

3667
02:32:28,470 --> 02:32:29,610
We got Palmon!

3668
02:32:31,970 --> 02:32:33,190

3669
02:32:34,570 --> 02:32:36,790
Alright, we gotta go and...

3670
02:32:37,510 --> 02:32:39,190
We gotta go and give you more training.

3671
02:32:40,590 --> 02:32:41,450
Oh, Palmon!

3672
02:32:41,630 --> 02:32:42,230
What are you gonna do?

3673
02:32:44,910 --> 02:32:48,650
Oh, they're gonna up like the amount of stuff there.

3674
02:32:50,710 --> 02:32:51,230
Alright.

3675
02:32:52,850 --> 02:32:55,330
What does... What does, uh...

3676
02:32:55,330 --> 02:32:56,530
Dragon 4 need?

3677
02:32:56,830 --> 02:32:57,990
I'll give you more MP.

3678
02:32:58,230 --> 02:33:00,170
Cause you're... You need more of that.

3679
02:33:01,150 --> 02:33:01,670
Um...

3680
02:33:02,330 --> 02:33:04,370
What does Dragon 4 need more of?

3681
02:33:07,150 --> 02:33:09,070
No, Dragon 4 has a lot of love.

3682
02:33:13,890 --> 02:33:15,570
Oh, 4 Wisdom?

3683
02:33:15,710 --> 02:33:16,690
What are they now?

3684
02:33:18,130 --> 02:33:18,970
Partner...

3685
02:33:19,690 --> 02:33:20,810
Uh, Status.

3686
02:33:22,250 --> 02:33:25,490
Let's see... He's only at 207.

3687
02:33:25,910 --> 02:33:27,550
Holy shit!

3688
02:33:27,670 --> 02:33:29,870
You need so much Wisdom!

3689
02:33:32,770 --> 02:33:33,610
Yay!

3690
02:33:33,770 --> 02:33:34,690
We got the Heart Bonus!

3691
02:33:35,930 --> 02:33:36,770
Nice.

3692
02:33:37,890 --> 02:33:40,110
Okay, 100... 240.

3693
02:33:41,170 --> 02:33:42,130
Alright, more.

3694
02:33:43,910 --> 02:33:44,750
Alright.

3695
02:33:44,830 --> 02:33:45,190
Okay.

3696
02:33:46,770 --> 02:33:47,290
Yay!

3697
02:33:51,010 --> 02:33:51,950

Plus 7.

3699
02:33:53,170 --> 02:33:53,810
Plus 65.

3700
02:33:54,430 --> 02:33:54,950
Okay.

3701
02:33:56,670 --> 02:33:57,190
Nice.

3702
02:33:57,670 --> 02:33:58,530
Okay, don't worry.

3703
02:33:58,610 --> 02:33:59,470
I'll take you to the bathroom!

3704
02:34:03,330 --> 02:34:06,830
600 Wisdom and 7900...

3705
02:34:06,830 --> 02:34:07,150
Jeez!

3706
02:34:08,790 --> 02:34:10,770
You guys have... Are you guys too tired?

3707
02:34:10,890 --> 02:34:11,330
Not yet?

3708
02:34:11,530 --> 02:34:12,250
Or are you guys good?

3709
02:34:14,330 --> 02:34:16,310
Okay, I can still train you guys a little more.

3710
02:34:17,050 --> 02:34:17,550
Alright.

3711
02:34:18,450 --> 02:34:18,950
Go.

3712
02:34:21,030 --> 02:34:21,530
Uh...

3713
02:34:24,050 --> 02:34:25,070
Go do your thing.

3714
02:34:26,170 --> 02:34:26,670
Yay!

3715
02:34:26,950 --> 02:34:27,970
We got another Bonus!

3716
02:34:29,350 --> 02:34:30,550

3717
02:34:30,910 --> 02:34:31,930
Plus 65.

3718
02:34:33,990 --> 02:34:34,490
Um...

3719
02:34:35,230 --> 02:34:35,730
Nice.

3720
02:34:35,810 --> 02:34:36,030
Alright.

3721
02:34:37,450 --> 02:34:39,510
I mean, I guess you're slowly getting smarter.

3722
02:34:39,970 --> 02:34:41,010
Are you tired?

3723
02:34:41,190 --> 02:34:41,730
I'm tired.

3724
02:34:41,730 --> 02:34:41,750
I'm tired.

3725
02:34:41,750 --> 02:34:41,810
I'm tired.

3726
02:34:43,270 --> 02:34:44,490
Are you tired?

3727
02:34:45,590 --> 02:34:46,310
Are you tired?

3728
02:34:46,310 --> 02:34:47,350
Dragon 4 wasn't tired.

3729
02:34:48,570 --> 02:34:49,870
How are you tired?

3730
02:34:56,720 --> 02:34:58,290
How are you tired?

3731
02:34:59,610 --> 02:35:00,650
It's tears.

3732
02:35:03,850 --> 02:35:04,550
Yay!

3733
02:35:09,920 --> 02:35:10,700
We got another Bonus!

3734
02:35:10,880 --> 02:35:11,460
Let's go!

3735
02:35:11,840 --> 02:35:13,000
I'm getting better at this.

3736
02:35:13,260 --> 02:35:14,080
Alright, 65.

3737
02:35:14,080 --> 02:35:16,940
65, 33... okay, wisdom is almost there.

3738
02:35:17,280 --> 02:35:18,800
We're almost there for wisdom.

3739
02:35:19,220 --> 02:35:20,640
Oh, are you guys hungry?

3740
02:35:20,860 --> 02:35:21,960
Oh, Dragon 4, you're hungry?

3741
02:35:22,060 --> 02:35:22,420
Don't worry.

3742
02:35:22,600 --> 02:35:22,960
Don't worry.

3743
02:35:23,540 --> 02:35:24,800
Mama's here to feed you.

3744
02:35:25,900 --> 02:35:27,880
Alright, here, have some meat.

3745
02:35:30,020 --> 02:35:30,860
What are you doing?

3746
02:35:30,960 --> 02:35:32,000
You're not Dragon 4.

3747
02:35:36,080 --> 02:35:41,120
I guess you can have some meat as well.

3748
02:35:46,200 --> 02:35:47,460
Alright, you're full.

3749
02:35:48,580 --> 02:35:49,140
Yay!

3750
02:35:52,760 --> 02:35:55,140
I need to remember to have both selected.

3751
02:35:56,200 --> 02:35:57,320
Oh wait.

3752
02:36:00,360 --> 02:36:01,540
That's not what I want to do.

3753
02:36:01,980 --> 02:36:03,700
Alright, time for more training guys!

3754
02:36:03,900 --> 02:36:04,720
It's training again!

3755
02:36:05,900 --> 02:36:06,460
Yeah!

3756
02:36:06,500 --> 02:36:07,280
More bonus!

3757
02:36:09,580 --> 02:36:11,640
Let's see... 65, 33...

3758
02:36:13,180 --> 02:36:14,120
Alright, that's good.

3759
02:36:14,600 --> 02:36:15,620
I'm just going to keep training.

3760
02:36:15,640 --> 02:36:16,560
I'm just going to keep training you guys until you're done.

3761
02:36:18,380 --> 02:36:20,920
I'm going to be here until I get got them on.

3762
02:36:22,040 --> 02:36:22,480
Yeah!

3763
02:36:22,940 --> 02:36:25,100
Okay, plus 33, plus 65.

3764
02:36:25,800 --> 02:36:27,480
Alright, one of you guys need to poop.

3765
02:36:27,760 --> 02:36:28,420
I'll take you.

3766
02:36:28,520 --> 02:36:30,040
One of you guys go to the bathroom break.

3767
02:36:30,480 --> 02:36:31,700
And then...

3768
02:36:33,380 --> 02:36:34,040
And then you.

3769
02:36:34,220 --> 02:36:35,060
We got to feed you.

3770
02:36:36,480 --> 02:36:36,920
Hello!

3771
02:36:39,640 --> 02:36:40,520
Alright, um...

3772
02:36:41,040 --> 02:36:41,480
Jesus.

3773
02:36:41,720 --> 02:36:42,500
How are you...

3774
02:36:42,500 --> 02:36:44,600
Dragon 3, how are you still so unhappy?

3775
02:36:45,640 --> 02:36:46,260
How are you still...

3776
02:36:46,260 --> 02:36:47,840
How are you...

3777
02:36:50,060 --> 02:36:51,940
I don't understand.

3778
02:36:52,400 --> 02:36:53,600
How are you still unhappy?

3779
02:36:54,410 --> 02:36:55,700
I feed you.

3780
02:36:57,800 --> 02:36:58,960
Stay focused.

3781
02:36:59,900 --> 02:37:03,600
We're going to keep training until we get got them on.

3782
02:37:04,920 --> 02:37:06,880
Until we get a cat.

3783
02:37:08,220 --> 02:37:09,740
That's all I want.

3784
02:37:10,320 --> 02:37:10,620
I'm here.

3785
02:37:12,390 --> 02:37:12,740
Night.

3786
02:37:15,340 --> 02:37:17,160
Alright, you're gonna sleep in the gym.

3787
02:37:20,480 --> 02:37:22,100
We're gonna sleep in the gym.

3788
02:37:22,600 --> 02:37:23,640
Alright, time to eat!

3789
02:37:23,740 --> 02:37:24,620
It's breakfast time!

3790
02:37:25,660 --> 02:37:28,600
Alright, you guys gotta lose weight, so I'm gonna feed you guys mushrooms now.

3791
02:37:29,360 --> 02:37:31,140
You both need to lose weight, guys.

3792
02:37:32,460 --> 02:37:34,160
I've been feeding you guys too much meat.

3793
02:37:35,760 --> 02:37:37,600
Okay, an apple with a smile to make you... Yeah!

3794
02:37:37,840 --> 02:37:39,260
Let's give you guys an apple too.

3795
02:37:41,440 --> 02:37:42,800
You guys lose weight with apple?

3796
02:37:42,800 --> 02:37:44,740
Completely full.

3797
02:37:44,860 --> 02:37:46,980
HP recovered by 10.

3798
02:37:47,180 --> 02:37:49,580
Oh, it's just mixed like... Holy shit!

3799
02:37:49,600 --> 02:37:50,920
How did you get sad?

3800
02:37:52,060 --> 02:37:53,900
How did you hate me more?

3801
02:37:53,980 --> 02:37:55,640
You lost your sadness!

3802
02:37:57,080 --> 02:37:57,660
Wait!

3803
02:37:57,960 --> 02:38:00,500
How did he lose his sad...

3804
02:38:00,500 --> 02:38:00,980
Wait!

3805
02:38:01,100 --> 02:38:02,760
He hates me more now!

3806
02:38:02,880 --> 02:38:03,740
I don't understand!

3807
02:38:06,440 --> 02:38:07,660
I don't understand!

3808
02:38:07,900 --> 02:38:09,920
Why does he hate me more?

3809
02:38:10,040 --> 02:38:11,220
What did I do?

3810
02:38:15,820 --> 02:38:17,600
What did I do to him?

3811
02:38:20,360 --> 02:38:22,780
Alright, 30, 60...

3812
02:38:24,880 --> 02:38:25,840
We're almost there.

3813
02:38:25,980 --> 02:38:26,820
We just need two more.

3814
02:38:27,480 --> 02:38:29,880
Alright, we're gonna go out to grab some food.

3815
02:38:31,440 --> 02:38:33,740
They seem satisfied with their new strength and training.

3816
02:38:33,980 --> 02:38:35,760
You did great, Dragos!

3817
02:38:35,780 --> 02:38:36,700
You did great!

3818
02:38:39,420 --> 02:38:42,780
Got Sorcerer's Mons, got Guard's Mons, Evil Geese...

3819
02:38:42,780 --> 02:38:43,060
Got the Solution.

3820
02:38:43,400 --> 02:38:45,200
We gotta grab some more meat though.

3821
02:38:45,560 --> 02:38:46,180
Eight!

3822
02:38:46,200 --> 02:38:46,540
Nice!

3823
02:38:47,320 --> 02:38:48,660
We now have eight meat.

3824
02:38:49,320 --> 02:38:51,680
We gotta store some stuff though.

3825
02:38:52,530 --> 02:38:52,840
Store.

3826
02:38:54,800 --> 02:38:57,040
We're holding way too much stuff.

3827
02:39:03,400 --> 02:39:04,580
I'll put seven.

3828
02:39:05,530 --> 02:39:06,300
And then...

3829
02:39:07,340 --> 02:39:09,040
I'll put the Porta Potties.

3830
02:39:10,360 --> 02:39:10,720
Uh...

3831
02:39:11,600 --> 02:39:12,820
Shady, thank you for the super chat!

3832
02:39:12,880 --> 02:39:13,140
Thank you!

3833
02:39:13,880 --> 02:39:16,780
Training will continue until happiness increases.

3834
02:39:18,280 --> 02:39:18,640
Alright.

3835
02:39:19,220 --> 02:39:20,300
We need more wisdom.

3836
02:39:20,500 --> 02:39:21,240
Do I have enough wisdom?

3837
02:39:21,800 --> 02:39:23,240
I don't remember if I like...

3838
02:39:24,060 --> 02:39:24,800
No, I don't.

3839
02:39:24,860 --> 02:39:26,120
I only have these.

3840
02:39:26,440 --> 02:39:27,140
Oh, I have MP.

3841
02:39:27,300 --> 02:39:27,660
Oh, wait.

3842
02:39:27,660 --> 02:39:28,380
Now that restores.

3843
02:39:28,920 --> 02:39:30,440
Alright, back to training you go!

3844
02:39:32,240 --> 02:39:34,360
Guys, we're not leaving until...

3845
02:39:37,980 --> 02:39:39,020
We're not leaving until...

3846
02:39:39,020 --> 02:39:41,500
One of you guys turn into the cat!

3847
02:39:43,840 --> 02:39:45,060
Where should we put...

3848
02:39:45,060 --> 02:39:47,080
Where should we put Dragoon 3, guys?

3849
02:39:48,060 --> 02:39:48,640
Where...

3850
02:39:48,640 --> 02:39:51,040
Where do we put Dragoon 3?

3851
02:40:00,680 --> 02:40:01,720

3852
02:40:02,980 --> 02:40:03,560

3853
02:40:03,700 --> 02:40:04,960
Alright, we'll put you in Strength.

3854
02:40:04,960 --> 02:40:05,180
Strength.

3855
02:40:07,580 --> 02:40:08,180
Yay!

3856
02:40:09,320 --> 02:40:09,920
Bonus!

3857
02:40:11,300 --> 02:40:13,360
Plus 28, plus 55.

3858
02:40:13,540 --> 02:40:14,520
Oh my god, we're almost there.

3859
02:40:14,540 --> 02:40:15,820
We need like 100 more.

3860
02:40:16,120 --> 02:40:17,180
Alright, bathroom break.

3861
02:40:22,650 --> 02:40:24,690
I got stronger into Spider.

3862
02:40:28,930 --> 02:40:29,530
Yeah!

3863
02:40:29,990 --> 02:40:31,110
We got the bonus!

3864
02:40:32,410 --> 02:40:33,830
128 you go.

3865
02:40:34,190 --> 02:40:34,910
We're so close.

3866
02:40:35,070 --> 02:40:35,950
We're so close.

3867
02:40:37,870 --> 02:40:38,790
Okay, uh...

3868
02:40:40,210 --> 02:40:41,590
Okay, we're gonna keep going.

3869
02:40:41,830 --> 02:40:45,170
I like how all the bonuses are on the other Dragoon.

3870
02:40:46,210 --> 02:40:46,810
Yeah!

3871
02:40:52,370 --> 02:40:53,270
Oh my god.

3872
02:40:53,330 --> 02:40:54,430
We're almost there.

3873
02:40:55,450 --> 02:40:57,790
Okay, I'll let you sleep.

3874
02:40:59,450 --> 02:41:01,610
You're not leaving this gym!

3875
02:41:04,050 --> 02:41:05,170
Don't hold back!

3876
02:41:05,170 --> 02:41:07,650
Your brother has to become a cat!

3877
02:41:09,150 --> 02:41:11,810
If it's the last thing I do!

3878
02:41:13,130 --> 02:41:13,850
Alright,

3879
02:41:17,230 --> 02:41:17,730
let's do it.

3880
02:41:17,850 --> 02:41:19,890
Keep going.

3881
02:41:20,730 --> 02:41:21,450
Yay!

3882
02:41:23,150 --> 02:41:24,650
Oh shit, you're hungry.

3883
02:41:25,230 --> 02:41:27,370
Sorry, I forgot to feed you guys.

3884
02:41:27,670 --> 02:41:28,750
Uh, items.

3885
02:41:30,410 --> 02:41:31,610
Time to eat!

3886
02:41:31,810 --> 02:41:32,170
Time to eat!

3887
02:41:33,450 --> 02:41:34,890
Time to eat!

3888
02:41:36,050 --> 02:41:37,250
And then... nice!

3889
02:41:37,390 --> 02:41:37,570
Okay.

3890
02:41:38,150 --> 02:41:39,170
Oh shit, not you.

3891
02:41:39,410 --> 02:41:40,010
God damn it!

3892
02:41:40,010 --> 02:41:41,050
I keep forgetting to feed the other!

3893
02:41:41,250 --> 02:41:43,290
I keep forgetting to do the all button!

3894
02:41:45,810 --> 02:41:46,610
Okay, there we go.

3895
02:41:46,750 --> 02:41:48,030
Now I'll feed both of them.

3896
02:41:49,530 --> 02:41:50,990
And then... come on!

3897
02:41:51,310 --> 02:41:51,970
Come eat!

3898
02:41:52,430 --> 02:41:53,510
My favorite child!

3899
02:41:54,230 --> 02:41:56,330
If I have a favorite but I don't...

3900
02:41:56,890 --> 02:41:58,450
Alright, back to the gym you go!

3901
02:42:00,590 --> 02:42:01,030
Yay!

3902
02:42:03,150 --> 02:42:03,530

3903
02:42:03,530 --> 02:42:03,790
Bonus!

3904
02:42:05,130 --> 02:42:06,190
Let's see...

3905
02:42:07,770 --> 02:42:09,170
Alright, that should be it, right?

3906
02:42:10,810 --> 02:42:11,890
I'm tired out.

3907
02:42:12,130 --> 02:42:13,010
Is that it?

3908
02:42:17,100 --> 02:42:17,700
Yes.

3909
02:42:17,700 --> 02:42:18,300
Rest.

3910
02:42:20,080 --> 02:42:22,220
Three finally smiled.

3911
02:42:25,840 --> 02:42:26,660
Oh yeah!

3912
02:42:26,820 --> 02:42:28,100
You guys did great!

3913
02:42:28,440 --> 02:42:30,060
You guys did great!

3914
02:42:30,060 --> 02:42:30,380
Three!

3915
02:42:32,840 --> 02:42:34,760
Okay, I need MP now.

3916
02:42:35,180 --> 02:42:36,220
Alright, go to the bathroom.

3917
02:42:39,480 --> 02:42:40,640
I need less weight?

3918
02:42:41,760 --> 02:42:42,520
Oh my god.

3919
02:42:42,660 --> 02:42:44,380
Alright, it's time to go on a diet, Dragoon 4.

3920
02:42:46,700 --> 02:42:49,700
Dragoon 4, you gotta go on a diet for mommy.

3921
02:42:50,840 --> 02:42:52,040
We gotta find some mushrooms.

3922
02:42:52,220 --> 02:42:53,140
We gotta find some veggies.

3923
02:42:54,840 --> 02:42:56,520
Dragoon 3, you can eat as much as you want.

3924
02:42:56,660 --> 02:42:57,540
I don't really care.

3925
02:42:57,680 --> 02:42:58,560
But like, Dragoon 4!

3926
02:42:58,560 --> 02:43:08,280
If you want the talent scouts to choose you and say you're special cause you're mommy's special little Digimon, you gotta lose some weight.

3927
02:43:08,460 --> 02:43:08,880
Alright?

3928
02:43:11,240 --> 02:43:13,580
We'll eat this food.

3929
02:43:14,260 --> 02:43:15,300
That's on...

3930
02:43:15,300 --> 02:43:19,680
This is a pattern telling you certain Evos have weight maximum of 14.

3931
02:43:20,640 --> 02:43:23,760
Okay, we're gonna fucking need to find some mushrooms for you.

3932
02:43:26,120 --> 02:43:28,060
We gotta find you some vegetables.

3933
02:43:30,940 --> 02:43:37,260
You gotta find you some vegetables so you can be a hot and... hot... hot angelmon.

3934
02:43:37,420 --> 02:43:38,320
Wait, what was it?

3935
02:43:38,420 --> 02:43:38,820
What was it?

3936
02:43:39,200 --> 02:43:39,680
Angelwoman!

3937
02:43:41,120 --> 02:43:42,960
Oh yeah, it was Angelwoman.

3938
02:43:46,840 --> 02:43:48,920
Cause after that you go!

3939
02:43:56,880 --> 02:43:59,740
Wait, two of the... Level 4?!

3940
02:44:00,520 --> 02:44:01,640
Holy shit!

3941
02:44:04,380 --> 02:44:05,500
Oh my...

3942
02:44:05,500 --> 02:44:06,000
Oh

3943
02:44:25,800 --> 02:44:27,180

3944
02:44:27,900 --> 02:44:28,680
Oh no.

3945
02:44:29,100 --> 02:44:31,240
Um... I'm trying...

3946
02:44:31,240 --> 02:44:31,920
No, don't cry.

3947
02:44:32,060 --> 02:44:32,540
Don't cry.

3948
02:44:32,920 --> 02:44:33,740
Don't cry.

3949
02:44:33,900 --> 02:44:35,620
I got... I got the bandaid!

3950
02:44:36,200 --> 02:44:37,060
Here you go!

3951
02:44:39,100 --> 02:44:40,320
Oh, thank god.

3952
02:44:40,440 --> 02:44:41,440
Oh, you're not dead.

3953
02:44:41,660 --> 02:44:43,340
Oh, I thought you guys died.

3954
02:44:43,660 --> 02:44:45,380
I... I thought...

3955
02:44:45,380 --> 02:44:47,560
After... I thought after everything...

3956
02:44:47,560 --> 02:44:51,660
After all the time I spent on trying to get you into... a cat!

3957
02:44:51,980 --> 02:44:53,960
I thought I lost all the progress!

3958
02:44:54,480 --> 02:44:55,700
Oh, you're still alive!

3959
02:44:56,060 --> 02:44:56,720
Thank god!

3960
02:44:59,060 --> 02:45:01,300
Oh, thank god they're still alive!

3961
02:45:01,640 --> 02:45:03,840
Oh my god, I thought they died.

3962
02:45:04,720 --> 02:45:05,840
Holy shit!

3963
02:45:06,100 --> 02:45:07,520
Anyway, back to training you go.

3964
02:45:07,640 --> 02:45:08,440
It's MP time.

3965
02:45:08,780 --> 02:45:11,560
Alright, MP and then I guess you can do strength.

3966
02:45:11,940 --> 02:45:13,680
Alright, back to the gym you go.

3967
02:45:14,020 --> 02:45:14,820
Back to...

3968
02:45:15,380 --> 02:45:16,620
Back to training.

3969
02:45:16,680 --> 02:45:20,180
All she cares about is the dumb cat.

3970
02:45:24,220 --> 02:45:25,820
That's the king, right?

3971
02:45:29,420 --> 02:45:31,040
Here you go.

3972
02:45:31,060 --> 02:45:32,020
Eat your mushrooms.

3973
02:45:32,160 --> 02:45:33,300
You gotta lose weight.

3974
02:45:34,160 --> 02:45:35,480
You gotta lose weight.

3975
02:45:36,720 --> 02:45:37,360
Alright.

3976
02:45:39,620 --> 02:45:40,900
Okay, uh...

3977
02:45:40,900 --> 02:45:42,900
This one you get meat.

3978
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:44,500
You can eat meat if you want.

3979
02:45:45,380 --> 02:45:45,780
Okay.

3980
02:45:45,800 --> 02:45:45,980
Get it.

3981
02:45:47,860 --> 02:45:49,680
Alright, nice.

3982
02:45:49,860 --> 02:45:50,660
Alright, time to train.

3983
02:45:52,360 --> 02:45:53,240
Training again.

3984
02:45:56,440 --> 02:45:56,880
Yay!

3985
02:45:56,880 --> 02:45:57,320
Bonus!

3986
02:46:00,200 --> 02:46:00,720
Let's see.

3987
02:46:00,820 --> 02:46:01,520
We're almost there.

3988
02:46:02,580 --> 02:46:04,520
Alright, and then... more bonus.

3989
02:46:05,840 --> 02:46:06,280
Yeah!

3990
02:46:09,270 --> 02:46:10,550
God, I'm so good at this.

3991
02:46:10,990 --> 02:46:12,030
So good at this game.

3992
02:46:12,230 --> 02:46:12,430
Okay.

3993
02:46:13,030 --> 02:46:13,670
Potty break!

3994
02:46:14,110 --> 02:46:14,710
Potty break!

3995
02:46:19,030 --> 02:46:19,590
Yay!

3996
02:46:20,290 --> 02:46:21,390
Alright, it's...

3997
02:46:21,390 --> 02:46:22,390
We're good to go.

3998
02:46:23,790 --> 02:46:24,690
Alright, you guys.

3999
02:46:24,910 --> 02:46:26,430
Are you guys happy with mommy?

4000
02:46:27,610 --> 02:46:29,410
Wait, we gotta put some stuff away.

4001
02:46:30,810 --> 02:46:31,370
Uh...

4002
02:46:31,370 --> 02:46:32,110
Store.

4003
02:46:32,810 --> 02:46:35,010
I don't think we need any of the chips anymore.

4004
02:46:37,050 --> 02:46:39,670
We need more of the green mushrooms though.

4005
02:46:40,430 --> 02:46:42,190
Um... 4000 MP?

4006
02:46:42,750 --> 02:46:44,010
Wait, it needs 4000?

4007
02:46:44,010 --> 02:46:47,190
I thought it was 3000.

4008
02:46:56,410 --> 02:46:58,530
7000... 7800 for a cat?

4009
02:46:59,470 --> 02:47:01,590
Alright, I need you to eat this disc.

4010
02:47:02,130 --> 02:47:02,470
I need...

4011
02:47:04,410 --> 02:47:05,890
Oh no, that's the restore.

4012
02:47:06,090 --> 02:47:07,630
God damn, I keep thinking that's the...

4013
02:47:10,690 --> 02:47:12,430
It's 7800... Back to the gym.

4014
02:47:13,630 --> 02:47:16,010
We're not leaving the gym.

4015
02:47:17,830 --> 02:47:18,530
We're gonna try...

4016
02:47:18,530 --> 02:47:19,490
We're gonna try...

4017
02:47:19,490 --> 02:47:21,290
Train until you're a cat.

4018
02:47:21,710 --> 02:47:22,750
Wait a minute.

4019
02:47:24,510 --> 02:47:26,030
Holy shit!

4020
02:47:26,190 --> 02:47:29,570
What do you mean a 7800?

4021
02:47:31,090 --> 02:47:31,930
What?

4022
02:47:41,120 --> 02:47:43,380
Oh shit, it was...

4023
02:47:44,300 --> 02:47:45,580
Doesn't wanna wake up?

4024
02:47:47,300 --> 02:47:48,960
Who doesn't wanna wake up?

4025
02:47:50,200 --> 02:47:51,500
Dragon 3.

4026
02:47:51,500 --> 02:47:52,500
Stop that!

4027
02:47:52,520 --> 02:47:53,500
Bad dragon!

4028
02:47:53,940 --> 02:47:55,780
Listen to your tamer!

4029
02:47:55,920 --> 02:47:57,360
I wanna eat!

4030
02:47:57,940 --> 02:47:59,500
Holy shit!

4031
02:48:04,100 --> 02:48:09,820
Dragon 4 was like, listen to your tamer, I wanna eat!

4032
02:48:10,480 --> 02:48:11,720
Here you go!

4033
02:48:14,300 --> 02:48:15,940
There we go.

4034
02:48:17,580 --> 02:48:19,300
Holy shit.

4035
02:48:19,520 --> 02:48:21,480
Dragon 4 is like, listen to your tamer, I wanna eat!

4036
02:48:31,840 --> 02:48:33,000
Dragon 4?

4037
02:48:35,920 --> 02:48:36,180
Dragon 4 is like, let me be ledge language...

4038
02:48:36,820 --> 02:48:37,600
Dragon 5, come join us.

4039
02:48:37,600 --> 02:48:41,580
No, no, no need to come here.

4040
02:48:41,580 --> 02:48:41,860
Mommy!

4041
02:48:43,040 --> 02:48:44,420
Alright, here, have some meat.

4042
02:48:45,320 --> 02:48:47,580
Dragon 3 needs some vacation.

4043
02:48:50,680 --> 02:48:52,820
Alright, it's time for you to lose weight, Mori.

4044
02:48:53,760 --> 02:48:55,440
You're still not the ideal weight.

4045
02:48:56,780 --> 02:48:57,460
Alright, nice.

4046
02:48:57,580 --> 02:48:58,860
Okay, we gotta find plants though.

4047
02:48:59,320 --> 02:49:00,060
Let's go back.

4048
02:49:01,020 --> 02:49:02,780
And then we're gonna grab some...

4049
02:49:04,040 --> 02:49:05,140
Let's get some meat.

4050
02:49:05,300 --> 02:49:07,000
Alright, we gotta find some...

4051
02:49:08,760 --> 02:49:10,840
We gotta find some plants for you.

4052
02:49:12,140 --> 02:49:14,840
MP 7800, Wisdom 600.

4053
02:49:15,160 --> 02:49:16,540
Jesus Christ!

4054
02:49:16,720 --> 02:49:18,480
That's a lot of wisdom!

4055
02:49:22,160 --> 02:49:23,800
Oh my god!

4056
02:49:24,300 --> 02:49:26,240
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

4057
02:49:26,300 --> 02:49:27,360
Thank you, thank you.

4058
02:49:28,320 --> 02:49:31,100
We need to find plants so you can lose weight!

4059
02:49:33,440 --> 02:49:34,120
Gatomon!

4060
02:49:35,640 --> 02:49:38,040
Gatomon is like skinny.

4061
02:49:38,100 --> 02:49:40,500
You're too flabby right now.

4062
02:49:42,380 --> 02:49:44,600
How the fuck do I find the mushrooms?

4063
02:49:45,880 --> 02:49:47,920
These mushrooms are so hard to find!

4064
02:49:50,660 --> 02:49:51,840
We need to get MP!

4065
02:49:54,540 --> 02:49:56,100
Just go to Battle Winds.

4066
02:49:56,300 --> 02:49:57,860
You're right, maybe I should just get Battle Winds.

4067
02:49:57,960 --> 02:49:59,200
But I still need mushrooms though.

4068
02:49:59,540 --> 02:50:00,780
I need to find mushrooms.

4069
02:50:02,820 --> 02:50:05,020
How the fuck... where are the mushrooms?

4070
02:50:06,400 --> 02:50:08,760
Okay guys, we need to walk around until we get mushrooms.

4071
02:50:09,280 --> 02:50:09,860
Wait, what?

4072
02:50:11,860 --> 02:50:12,760
Nooooooo!

4073
02:50:12,780 --> 02:50:13,420
No!

4074
02:50:13,680 --> 02:50:16,240
You better evolve into a fucking cat!

4075
02:50:21,530 --> 02:50:22,430
Yes!

4076
02:50:23,450 --> 02:50:24,650
You're a cat!

4077
02:50:32,170 --> 02:50:35,270
Oh my god, look at you!

4078
02:50:36,230 --> 02:50:38,130
You're so cute!

4079
02:50:39,150 --> 02:50:39,850
Not you.

4080
02:50:40,640 --> 02:50:41,610
Look at you!

4081
02:50:42,540 --> 02:50:42,990
Ready?

4082
02:50:42,990 --> 02:50:43,490
I...

4083
02:50:50,710 --> 02:50:54,710
I got the cat!

4084
02:50:54,710 --> 02:50:54,890
Aaaaa!

4085
02:50:57,030 --> 02:50:58,850
Oh my god!

4086
02:50:59,430 --> 02:51:01,450
You're mommy's favorite!

4087
02:51:02,430 --> 02:51:04,010
Look at you!

4088
02:51:06,670 --> 02:51:08,710
This damn cat!

4089
02:51:11,050 --> 02:51:13,110
You're mommy's favorite!

4090
02:51:17,070 --> 02:51:19,710
I got the cat!

4091
02:51:20,090 --> 02:51:21,410
You're so cute!

4092
02:51:22,210 --> 02:51:23,430
You're so cute!

4093
02:51:24,350 --> 02:51:25,410
Look at him!

4094
02:51:27,390 --> 02:51:28,710
Let's pick this up.

4095
02:51:29,050 --> 02:51:30,150
What level is that?

4096
02:51:31,310 --> 02:51:32,690
Oh shit, level 3?

4097
02:51:33,330 --> 02:51:34,450
We should be fine.

4098
02:51:34,510 --> 02:51:35,750
We should be fine with level 3.

4099
02:51:38,010 --> 02:51:39,310
Oh, look at you!

4100
02:51:43,080 --> 02:51:43,900
Oh my god.

4101
02:51:47,240 --> 02:51:48,700
What the fuck?

4102
02:51:48,760 --> 02:51:49,520
I thought...

4103
02:51:49,520 --> 02:51:51,320
How strong is he?

4104
02:51:52,140 --> 02:51:54,400
No, no, restore 500.

4105
02:51:54,400 --> 02:51:55,700
Go get... No!

4106
02:51:56,320 --> 02:51:56,640
No!

4107
02:51:58,100 --> 02:51:58,760
No!

4108
02:52:06,260 --> 02:52:06,970
Are you okay?

4109
02:52:08,630 --> 02:52:10,410
Are you okay, Drago4?

4110
02:52:11,190 --> 02:52:12,450
Drago4, are you okay?

4111
02:52:12,730 --> 02:52:13,390
Drago4?

4112
02:52:13,910 --> 02:52:15,130
Drago4, are you okay?

4113
02:52:15,210 --> 02:52:16,490
I'm so sorry!

4114
02:52:16,890 --> 02:52:17,950
Mommy's sorry!

4115
02:52:18,470 --> 02:52:19,530
Are you okay?

4116
02:52:24,220 --> 02:52:25,630
Are you okay?

4117
02:52:26,610 --> 02:52:28,790
Don't worry, mommy's got you.

4118
02:52:28,830 --> 02:52:30,270
I got the recovery disc.

4119
02:52:30,470 --> 02:52:30,810
I got the recovery disc for you.

4120
02:52:31,350 --> 02:52:33,490
I got the recovery disc for both of you.

4121
02:52:34,830 --> 02:52:35,470
It's okay.

4122
02:52:37,030 --> 02:52:39,030
Mommy loves you, Drago4.

4123
02:52:40,090 --> 02:52:41,570
Here, I'll kiss your poo-poos.

4124
02:52:43,750 --> 02:52:44,670
Drago3, what are you doing?

4125
02:52:44,790 --> 02:52:45,190
Drago3.

4126
02:52:46,070 --> 02:52:48,390
You were supposed to protect your brother!

4127
02:52:48,990 --> 02:52:52,190
You were supposed to protect your younger brother, Drago3!

4128
02:52:52,430 --> 02:52:53,210
What were you doing?

4129
02:52:53,510 --> 02:52:55,250
Why would you let your older brother...

4130
02:52:55,250 --> 02:52:58,470
Why would you let your younger brother get hurt?

4131
02:52:58,470 --> 02:52:59,030
Why are you hurting him?!

4132
02:53:04,550 --> 02:53:05,730
Okay, let's see.

4133
02:53:06,130 --> 02:53:07,550
Oh my god, look, now you're a cat!

4134
02:53:08,110 --> 02:53:09,390
Look at that, Drago4!

4135
02:53:09,450 --> 02:53:10,370
Now you're a cat!

4136
02:53:13,590 --> 02:53:14,930
Oh my god, you're so cute!

4137
02:53:15,210 --> 02:53:17,990
Look at what they can piec up.

4138
02:53:18,090 --> 02:53:20,250
And they are raised with love!

4139
02:53:20,670 --> 02:53:22,370
Thank you the superchat Gio.

4140
02:53:22,470 --> 02:53:22,890
Thank you!

4141
02:53:22,890 --> 02:53:23,510
Thank you.

4142
02:53:27,070 --> 02:53:28,210
Alright, let's see.

4143
02:53:28,530 --> 02:53:31,270
We gotta go... let's go to the weaker areas.

4144
02:53:31,390 --> 02:53:33,770
Why are we like so weak?

4145
02:53:34,010 --> 02:53:35,430
Like where can we go?

4146
02:53:35,750 --> 02:53:39,510
I feel like we can't go anywhere because we're so weak.

4147
02:53:44,730 --> 02:53:47,090
Like where can I live?

4148
02:53:47,590 --> 02:53:49,750
I feel like I'm just weak.

4149
02:53:49,750 --> 02:53:50,310
Weak!

4150
02:53:51,730 --> 02:53:53,970
Because you're still level one.

4151
02:53:55,950 --> 02:53:57,130
Alright, let's go.

4152
02:53:57,470 --> 02:53:57,790
Alright.

4153
02:53:58,050 --> 02:53:58,850
I got them all!

4154
02:53:59,170 --> 02:53:59,930
Dragone 4!

4155
02:54:00,630 --> 02:54:02,070
Show me what you got!

4156
02:54:03,050 --> 02:54:04,070
Fight this!

4157
02:54:04,530 --> 02:54:05,770
Fight the goblin!

4158
02:54:06,870 --> 02:54:09,270
I wanna see how your strength is like!

4159
02:54:10,650 --> 02:54:11,290
Go!

4160
02:54:12,570 --> 02:54:14,590
Wait, maybe he's a little weak.

4161
02:54:14,790 --> 02:54:15,870
No, he's not weak.

4162
02:54:16,430 --> 02:54:17,070
Yeah!

4163
02:54:19,750 --> 02:54:20,030
Okay.

4164
02:54:20,170 --> 02:54:21,130
Lightning paw!

4165
02:54:21,290 --> 02:54:22,510
Show me the lightning paw!

4166
02:54:25,750 --> 02:54:27,370
I live at the gym!

4167
02:54:30,990 --> 02:54:33,110
A thousand damage!

4168
02:54:33,630 --> 02:54:34,610
Wait that's actually crazy.

4169
02:54:37,110 --> 02:54:37,830
Alright.

4170
02:54:39,510 --> 02:54:40,870
You guys did great!

4171
02:54:41,450 --> 02:54:41,690
Good job!

4172
02:54:41,710 --> 02:54:42,750
Good job everybody!

4173
02:54:43,490 --> 02:54:44,290
Good job!

4174
02:54:45,250 --> 02:54:47,410
Good job!

4175
02:54:47,410 --> 02:54:47,630
Good job!

4176
02:54:47,630 --> 02:54:49,070
You got Taomon's...

4177
02:54:49,070 --> 02:54:49,270
You got Taomon's...

4178
02:54:49,270 --> 02:54:50,030
Ability?

4179
02:54:50,190 --> 02:54:51,910
Okay, let's go grab this berry.

4180
02:54:52,810 --> 02:54:53,570
What's this?

4181
02:54:54,270 --> 02:54:56,570
Wait, what can you evolve into, Gatomon?

4182
02:54:58,990 --> 02:55:00,450
Okay, let's see.

4183
02:55:02,670 --> 02:55:03,250
Taomon.

4184
02:55:03,450 --> 02:55:05,010
Oh no, that's...

4185
02:55:05,010 --> 02:55:07,370
I want Angel Woman.

4186
02:55:07,870 --> 02:55:10,170
I want you to evolve into Angel Woman.

4187
02:55:11,030 --> 02:55:12,530
Alright, let's grab the mushrooms.

4188
02:55:14,190 --> 02:55:14,770
Nice.

4189
02:55:14,990 --> 02:55:15,570
Alright.

4190
02:55:15,570 --> 02:55:15,770
Okay.

4191
02:55:16,250 --> 02:55:18,350
Maybe there's like less people...

4192
02:55:18,350 --> 02:55:19,190
Maybe like...

4193
02:55:19,890 --> 02:55:22,210
They're hard... They're less hard here.

4194
02:55:23,350 --> 02:55:24,950
It's a power plant number two.

4195
02:55:25,010 --> 02:55:26,290
Maybe power plant number two.

4196
02:55:27,090 --> 02:55:30,470
Because I feel like everybody is so like overpowered.

4197
02:55:31,390 --> 02:55:32,630
Oh god, oh god.

4198
02:55:33,950 --> 02:55:34,970
Oh god, we gotta go.

4199
02:55:35,050 --> 02:55:35,630
We gotta go this way.

4200
02:55:35,650 --> 02:55:36,170
We gotta go this way.

4201
02:55:38,390 --> 02:55:40,350
Oh, definitely not this way.

4202
02:55:42,890 --> 02:55:44,710
I saw level five.

4203
02:55:46,010 --> 02:55:47,550
Definitely not there.

4204
02:55:48,050 --> 02:55:49,590
Maybe the cableway?

4205
02:55:49,930 --> 02:55:51,570
Where the fuck do I go?

4206
02:55:51,730 --> 02:55:54,050
Why is everybody so strong?

4207
02:55:59,630 --> 02:56:00,990
Wait, it's two.

4208
02:56:01,110 --> 02:56:02,650
Okay, we're gonna have to use our items.

4209
02:56:03,370 --> 02:56:03,890
Recovery.

4210
02:56:05,610 --> 02:56:06,130
Nice.

4211
02:56:06,130 --> 02:56:06,390
Alright.

4212
02:56:07,350 --> 02:56:08,890
So, and then...

4213
02:56:08,890 --> 02:56:10,010
Use your metal claws.

4214
02:56:10,150 --> 02:56:10,490
Use it!

4215
02:56:12,170 --> 02:56:12,690
Go!

4216
02:56:15,670 --> 02:56:16,470
Punch him up!

4217
02:56:16,650 --> 02:56:17,390
Speed him up!

4218
02:56:20,550 --> 02:56:21,890
Come on, he's so low!

4219
02:56:22,210 --> 02:56:22,650
Yeah!

4220
02:56:23,650 --> 02:56:26,630
You go to the gym and live there forever!

4221
02:56:28,270 --> 02:56:31,310
But I don't wanna live in the gym!

4222
02:56:37,490 --> 02:56:40,530
I'm trying to find a stick right now!

4223
02:56:43,970 --> 02:56:46,990
Why is it so hard to find a stick?

4224
02:56:51,690 --> 02:56:53,070
I missed the gym!

4225
02:56:54,910 --> 02:56:57,510
Why is everybody so strong?

4226
02:56:57,990 --> 02:56:59,950
Oh, it's Dark Gobblemon!

4227
02:57:01,490 --> 02:57:03,810
Okay, we do not wanna mess with them.

4228
02:57:03,970 --> 02:57:06,830
We don't wanna mess with them.

4229
02:57:06,890 --> 02:57:08,750
Guys, we don't wanna mess with them.

4230
02:57:08,950 --> 02:57:11,230
We don't wanna mess with them.

4231
02:57:13,770 --> 02:57:15,110
Oh my god.

4232
02:57:17,810 --> 02:57:20,290
Oh my god, that was scary.

4233
02:57:20,430 --> 02:57:21,670
I saw level six, but I didn't know what was going on.

4234
02:57:21,670 --> 02:57:24,150
Oh my god, we're so fucking dead.

4235
02:57:24,930 --> 02:57:26,370
We're so dead.

4236
02:57:28,090 --> 02:57:29,890
Okay, maybe there's a stick over there.

4237
02:57:33,520 --> 02:57:35,420
Maybe there's a stick over here.

4238
02:57:39,020 --> 02:57:40,160
Are there any sticks?

4239
02:57:41,340 --> 02:57:42,780
Are there any sticks here?

4240
02:57:43,320 --> 02:57:44,320
I fucked up.

4241
02:57:44,360 --> 02:57:45,960
That one time, I like...

4242
02:57:46,900 --> 02:57:49,080
That was actually so fucked up.

4243
02:57:49,120 --> 02:57:54,260
I did not realize that was like the one time I found the fucking elusive rare stick.

4244
02:57:54,260 --> 02:57:54,440
I did not realize that was like the one time I found the fucking elusive rare stick.

4245
02:57:58,290 --> 02:57:59,990
Back to the forest we go.

4246
02:58:00,970 --> 02:58:01,750
Come on.

4247
02:58:01,810 --> 02:58:02,690
Come on, three.

4248
02:58:02,970 --> 02:58:04,830
Your brother already leveled up.

4249
02:58:04,910 --> 02:58:06,270
You were born first, three.

4250
02:58:06,490 --> 02:58:08,330
Your brother's already leveled up.

4251
02:58:08,370 --> 02:58:10,190
What's stopping you from leveling up as well?

4252
02:58:11,110 --> 02:58:11,870
Come on!

4253
02:58:13,930 --> 02:58:16,570
If you wanna win mommy's love, you gotta...

4254
02:58:16,570 --> 02:58:17,010
If you wanna win mommy's love, you gotta...

4255
02:58:17,010 --> 02:58:17,810
You gotta earn it.

4256
02:58:21,150 --> 02:58:22,210
Look for the...

4257
02:58:22,210 --> 02:58:23,790
Oh, it's golden glowing patch.

4258
02:58:23,790 --> 02:58:24,730
Okay, it's gold.

4259
02:58:26,530 --> 02:58:27,830
Uh, three...

4260
02:58:28,690 --> 02:58:30,050
Late bloomer.

4261
02:58:30,290 --> 02:58:32,010
I love you enough!

4262
02:58:35,610 --> 02:58:38,290
You're supposed to make sure your brother's safe.

4263
02:58:39,410 --> 02:58:42,110
Uh, where the fuck are the sticks?

4264
02:58:43,330 --> 02:58:45,070
All I get is wood.

4265
02:58:47,670 --> 02:58:49,970
All I get is wood.

4266
02:58:49,990 --> 02:58:51,510
I wish you could stop digivolution.

4267
02:58:56,170 --> 02:58:57,210
Check the stats?

4268
02:58:57,490 --> 02:58:58,150
No, it's okay.

4269
02:58:58,550 --> 02:59:00,170
He'll evolve when he has to.

4270
02:59:00,250 --> 02:59:01,790
He'll digivolve when he has to.

4271
02:59:05,070 --> 02:59:05,850
Wait, I got sick?

4272
02:59:06,170 --> 02:59:07,070
Oh, I just got it?

4273
02:59:07,150 --> 02:59:07,790
I didn't even notice.

4274
02:59:08,110 --> 02:59:09,050
I didn't even notice.

4275
02:59:11,610 --> 02:59:12,050
Okay.

4276
02:59:13,630 --> 02:59:14,810
I wanna make...

4277
02:59:14,810 --> 02:59:15,190
I want...

4278
02:59:15,190 --> 02:59:16,690
I want Gatomon to be a...

4279
02:59:16,690 --> 02:59:17,710
Be a cat forever.

4280
02:59:17,970 --> 02:59:18,130
Look!

4281
02:59:18,290 --> 02:59:19,430
Look at Gatomon run!

4282
02:59:20,350 --> 02:59:21,450
Look at her go!

4283
02:59:22,350 --> 02:59:23,250
Oh my god.

4284
02:59:23,250 --> 02:59:24,170
You're so cute!

4285
02:59:25,230 --> 02:59:26,610
You're so cute!

4286
02:59:27,310 --> 02:59:32,470
All that effort I spent in making you the cutest paid off!

4287
02:59:33,250 --> 02:59:34,450
Oh, you need to eat.

4288
02:59:35,390 --> 02:59:36,370
Alright, gather around.

4289
02:59:36,690 --> 02:59:38,230
Now you can eat again!

4290
02:59:39,450 --> 02:59:40,010
Now...

4291
02:59:40,010 --> 02:59:42,230
Now you can both eat!

4292
02:59:44,770 --> 02:59:46,030
Wait, I wanna make...

4293
02:59:46,030 --> 02:59:47,130
I wanna feed both of you.

4294
02:59:47,230 --> 02:59:48,850
Why can't I feed both of you guys?

4295
02:59:49,610 --> 02:59:50,510
Oh, there you go.

4296
02:59:50,570 --> 02:59:50,770
Alright.

4297
02:59:50,890 --> 02:59:52,730
Now you both eat me!

4298
02:59:56,310 --> 02:59:56,710
Alright.

4299
02:59:56,890 --> 02:59:57,190
Yay!

4300
02:59:58,690 --> 02:59:59,630
Time to eat!

4301
02:59:59,670 --> 03:00:00,150
Here you go!

4302
03:00:00,770 --> 03:00:03,570
You don't have to go on a diet anymore, Dragoon 4!

4303
03:00:05,770 --> 03:00:06,570
Alright, nice.

4304
03:00:07,010 --> 03:00:09,570
Alright, we're gonna give him a stick.

4305
03:00:10,690 --> 03:00:11,670
I'm gonna run around.

4306
03:00:11,770 --> 03:00:12,350
Wanna run away.

4307
03:00:12,410 --> 03:00:12,750
Wanna run away.

4308
03:00:12,770 --> 03:00:13,210
Wanna run away.

4309
03:00:13,490 --> 03:00:13,890
Okay.

4310
03:00:15,310 --> 03:00:15,710
Yes!

4311
03:00:16,650 --> 03:00:17,770
I got you a stick!

4312
03:00:19,210 --> 03:00:19,610
Pesto!

4313
03:00:20,150 --> 03:00:21,150
Fishing rod complete!

4314
03:00:21,250 --> 03:00:22,130
Could have done it without...

4315
03:00:22,130 --> 03:00:22,710
Without...

4316
03:00:22,710 --> 03:00:22,830
Yeah!

4317
03:00:23,070 --> 03:00:24,110
Now I can fish!

4318
03:00:25,750 --> 03:00:26,950
Okay, we gotta go home now.

4319
03:00:27,090 --> 03:00:27,390
No!

4320
03:00:28,190 --> 03:00:29,010
Of course.

4321
03:00:29,310 --> 03:00:31,090
I just literally...

4322
03:00:33,370 --> 03:00:33,850
Yeah!

4323
03:00:33,950 --> 03:00:34,670
Kick the plant!

4324
03:00:35,950 --> 03:00:36,790
Kick the plant!

4325
03:00:37,350 --> 03:00:39,110
Okay, I can't do anything.

4326
03:00:40,470 --> 03:00:41,390
Alright, go fight!

4327
03:00:41,490 --> 03:00:41,790
Go fight!

4328
03:00:44,130 --> 03:00:45,130
Okay, there you go.

4329
03:00:45,550 --> 03:00:46,730
Oh, critical hit!

4330
03:00:46,910 --> 03:00:47,330
Nice!

4331
03:00:47,750 --> 03:00:48,830
How did you miss?

4332
03:00:50,090 --> 03:00:50,570
Yeah!

4333
03:00:51,330 --> 03:00:52,690
Oh, nice!

4334
03:00:57,080 --> 03:00:58,140
We did it!

4335
03:00:59,500 --> 03:01:00,880
You guys did great!

4336
03:01:01,120 --> 03:01:03,740
I'm so proud of you, Dragoon 4!

4337
03:01:08,160 --> 03:01:08,680
Three?

4338
03:01:09,460 --> 03:01:10,360
Alright, what did you...

4339
03:01:10,360 --> 03:01:10,620
What...

4340
03:01:10,620 --> 03:01:11,600
Three, what are you gonna become?

4341
03:01:12,580 --> 03:01:13,620
Oh my god, finally!

4342
03:01:14,040 --> 03:01:15,580
You were such a late bloomer!

4343
03:01:16,900 --> 03:01:18,780
I wonder what he is gonna become though.

4344
03:01:20,460 --> 03:01:21,260
A man!

4345
03:01:24,080 --> 03:01:24,600
No!

4346
03:01:36,490 --> 03:01:37,010
No!

4347
03:01:37,030 --> 03:01:37,330
No!

4348
03:01:38,830 --> 03:01:43,440
No, no, no!

4349
03:01:44,240 --> 03:01:46,680
Oh god, oh god!

4350
03:01:46,780 --> 03:01:47,800
We gotta run!

4351
03:01:48,900 --> 03:01:50,560
Oh my

4352
03:01:55,190 --> 03:01:55,190
god!

4353
03:01:55,570 --> 03:01:56,790
We got...

4354
03:01:56,790 --> 03:02:06,390
It was meant to be!

4355
03:02:07,950 --> 03:02:10,030
We can't watch him die!

4356
03:02:10,190 --> 03:02:11,690
We can't give drama!

4357
03:02:12,250 --> 03:02:12,590
We...

4358
03:02:12,590 --> 03:02:14,170
Oh my god...

4359
03:02:15,350 --> 03:02:16,150
Blah!

4360
03:02:16,170 --> 03:02:16,910
Trapify!

4361
03:02:16,930 --> 03:02:18,310
Oh my god, we did it!

4362
03:02:18,310 --> 03:02:20,050
We saved Wizardmon!

4363
03:02:23,740 --> 03:02:24,730
Oh my god!

4364
03:02:24,950 --> 03:02:27,830
We actually saved Wizardmon!

4365
03:02:27,890 --> 03:02:29,110
He didn't die!

4366
03:02:33,650 --> 03:02:36,070
I'm so proud of you, Dragoon3.

4367
03:02:36,350 --> 03:02:38,550
Oh my god, I've always...

4368
03:02:39,270 --> 03:02:45,110
You were always a great... You were always a good Dragoon.

4369
03:02:47,990 --> 03:02:49,610
I actually got it!

4370
03:02:49,610 --> 03:02:51,250
I got the iconic duo!

4371
03:02:51,790 --> 03:02:52,890
I knew it!

4372
03:02:53,030 --> 03:02:59,810
My mistreatment of you, Dragoon3, was only so you can become Wizardmon!

4373
03:03:00,250 --> 03:03:04,710
It was... I did it out of love, Wizardmon!

4374
03:03:06,210 --> 03:03:08,390
Dragoon3, I did it out of love!

4375
03:03:12,470 --> 03:03:16,910
I needed you to become... I needed you to harden your heart.

4376
03:03:16,930 --> 03:03:19,710
You need to harden yourself so you can become Wizardmon!

4377
03:03:20,390 --> 03:03:21,790
What do you love?

4378
03:03:21,990 --> 03:03:24,070
It was for your own good!

4379
03:03:31,610 --> 03:03:33,170
Oh my god, I'm so happy!

4380
03:03:33,410 --> 03:03:35,730
I got Wizardmon and Gatomon!

4381
03:03:35,910 --> 03:03:37,250
We're canon now!

4382
03:03:37,710 --> 03:03:38,850
We're canon!

4383
03:03:39,310 --> 03:03:40,770
And we can fish!

4384
03:03:41,130 --> 03:03:43,150
It was DigiDestiny!

4385
03:03:43,450 --> 03:03:44,170
Exactly!

4386
03:03:46,930 --> 03:03:49,330
Thank you for the magenta super blade!

4387
03:03:49,790 --> 03:03:51,150
Thank you, thank you!

4388
03:03:51,330 --> 03:03:53,530
It was DigiDestiny!

4389
03:03:54,010 --> 03:03:54,610
Guys!

4390
03:03:56,730 --> 03:03:59,370
Okay, we need to get heals for you, Wizardmon.

4391
03:03:59,410 --> 03:04:00,650
You're fucked up right now.

4392
03:04:03,310 --> 03:04:08,590
All that time doing strength training just to get a wizard.

4393
03:04:08,870 --> 03:04:15,830
Look, it's because of my love that Dragoon3 became who he was supposed to be.

4394
03:04:20,110 --> 03:04:22,070
My love did this.

4395
03:04:22,690 --> 03:04:25,990
You guys doubted me, but there was a plan.

4396
03:04:26,450 --> 03:04:28,390
There was a whole plan.

4397
03:04:37,590 --> 03:04:38,930
Alright, let's go!

4398
03:04:39,590 --> 03:04:41,010
Oh, I got... yeah, I got...

4399
03:04:41,010 --> 03:04:42,110
You're back!

4400
03:04:42,290 --> 03:04:43,110
I have good news!

4401
03:04:43,530 --> 03:04:44,610
Made my day!

4402
03:04:45,430 --> 03:04:45,710
Mmm!

4403
03:04:48,370 --> 03:04:50,430
I can tell you what your partner's favorite fruit is!

4404
03:04:50,670 --> 03:04:52,750
The city's prosperity is now four!

4405
03:04:53,050 --> 03:04:54,330
There's still a long way to go!

4406
03:04:54,610 --> 03:04:56,010
I can't believe it!

4407
03:04:59,470 --> 03:05:00,510
Oh, we got recovery.

4408
03:05:00,630 --> 03:05:01,670
Nice, we actually needed that.

4409
03:05:01,870 --> 03:05:03,430
I can't believe it!

4410
03:05:03,490 --> 03:05:05,610
We actually got...

4411
03:05:05,610 --> 03:05:09,670
We actually got the dynamic duo!

4412
03:05:10,550 --> 03:05:11,750
A health runner.

4413
03:05:11,930 --> 03:05:13,150
Okay, we need that actually.

4414
03:05:13,810 --> 03:05:15,110
Yeah, we need health runner.

4415
03:05:15,250 --> 03:05:16,130
What else do we need?

4416
03:05:17,630 --> 03:05:18,110
That's low.

4417
03:05:18,390 --> 03:05:19,710
I hate the city contempt.

4418
03:05:23,430 --> 03:05:25,710
What is my... what is the other one that we need?

4419
03:05:25,870 --> 03:05:26,450
MP runner?

4420
03:05:28,750 --> 03:05:29,190
Lifetype?

4421
03:05:31,750 --> 03:05:34,330
Who's happy when... wait, what do we want then?

4422
03:05:35,990 --> 03:05:36,870
MP runner.

4423
03:05:38,350 --> 03:05:39,230
MP runner?

4424
03:05:39,510 --> 03:05:39,930
Oh, here!

4425
03:05:40,130 --> 03:05:40,350
Okay.

4426
03:05:40,590 --> 03:05:41,950
Yeah, we... oh, we don't have enough!

4427
03:05:41,950 --> 03:05:43,830
We don't have enough though.

4428
03:05:43,930 --> 03:05:44,670
We gotta save up.

4429
03:05:45,010 --> 03:05:46,450
I can't believe it.

4430
03:05:46,530 --> 03:05:46,790
I... I...

4431
03:05:47,530 --> 03:05:48,910
It's so funny!

4432
03:05:50,730 --> 03:05:51,850
I just saved...

4433
03:05:51,850 --> 03:05:54,470
I can't believe I actually got them!

4434
03:05:54,850 --> 03:05:56,350
Holy shit!

4435
03:05:57,510 --> 03:05:59,810
Alright, do I have enough HP recovery?

4436
03:06:00,310 --> 03:06:03,510
I don't remember if I withdraw any... if I...

4437
03:06:05,010 --> 03:06:06,770
Uh... no, I didn't.

4438
03:06:06,850 --> 03:06:08,090
Okay, we gotta buy some.

4439
03:06:08,590 --> 03:06:09,610
Buy some.

4440
03:06:11,330 --> 03:06:11,930
Buy some.

4441
03:06:11,930 --> 03:06:14,190
Oh, we're not... wait, you're not 100%?

4442
03:06:14,270 --> 03:06:14,730
Oh, you are.

4443
03:06:14,810 --> 03:06:15,310
Okay, bye.

4444
03:06:16,590 --> 03:06:18,030
Autopilot recovery disc.

4445
03:06:18,370 --> 03:06:18,650
Alright.

4446
03:06:19,370 --> 03:06:20,550
I'll buy one extra.

4447
03:06:23,010 --> 03:06:25,790
Give HP and strength to Gato.

4448
03:06:26,270 --> 03:06:27,310
The Dragoon IV.

4449
03:06:27,750 --> 03:06:28,190
Okay.

4450
03:06:29,670 --> 03:06:31,370
Um, HP, strength.

4451
03:06:31,430 --> 03:06:31,830
Okay.

4452
03:06:32,490 --> 03:06:33,050
Alright.

4453
03:06:33,710 --> 03:06:34,730
Alright, Gato-mon!

4454
03:06:34,870 --> 03:06:35,730
Get over here!

4455
03:06:36,730 --> 03:06:39,290
I gotta give you HP and strength.

4456
03:06:40,110 --> 03:06:41,050
Alright, here.

4457
03:06:41,750 --> 03:06:42,750
Get more heals!

4458
03:06:43,170 --> 03:06:44,990
Cause mommy loves you!

4459
03:06:45,570 --> 03:06:46,950
And more strength!

4460
03:06:47,090 --> 03:06:48,870
Cause mommy really loves you!

4461
03:06:49,390 --> 03:06:49,930
Alright.

4462
03:06:50,210 --> 03:06:52,870
And Dragoon III, you're doing great.

4463
03:06:53,210 --> 03:06:53,970
Just don't die.

4464
03:07:02,950 --> 03:07:03,610
That's it.

4465
03:07:05,990 --> 03:07:07,910
Oh yeah, I was supposed to heal you!

4466
03:07:08,050 --> 03:07:08,590
Sorry!

4467
03:07:09,470 --> 03:07:11,010
Sorry, I need to take you back to the bed.

4468
03:07:11,150 --> 03:07:12,130
I forgot to heal you.

4469
03:07:15,050 --> 03:07:17,490
Give me a sec, I gotta go back to heal you.

4470
03:07:17,990 --> 03:07:19,930
Forgot the one most important thing.

4471
03:07:20,210 --> 03:07:21,750
Wait, so how do they die?

4472
03:07:22,610 --> 03:07:24,870
Like, I... okay, me and my chat's dead too.

4473
03:07:25,030 --> 03:07:26,490
I think it has to be OBS.

4474
03:07:26,830 --> 03:07:28,650
It has to be an OBS issue.

4475
03:07:28,750 --> 03:07:30,630
But I'll ask the chat coder.

4476
03:07:30,790 --> 03:07:36,230
To see if it's like... I'll ask the chat... the person who coded the chat to see if they know what's going on.

4477
03:07:37,650 --> 03:07:38,050
Alright.

4478
03:07:40,210 --> 03:07:40,850
Uh...

4479
03:07:40,850 --> 03:07:42,030
I need a rest.

4480
03:07:45,350 --> 03:07:45,990
Yeah.

4481
03:07:47,670 --> 03:07:48,570
Sleep tight!

4482
03:07:50,710 --> 03:07:51,350
Yay!

4483
03:07:52,170 --> 03:07:52,990
Alright, let's go.

4484
03:07:54,250 --> 03:07:56,270
You guys are so strong now!

4485
03:08:01,530 --> 03:08:02,590
Three battles!

4486
03:08:02,730 --> 03:08:04,690
Oh my god, I literally...

4487
03:08:05,770 --> 03:08:06,410
Wait!

4488
03:08:07,910 --> 03:08:12,630
If I lost that battle there, we would've died!

4489
03:08:12,890 --> 03:08:14,310
Yeah, we would've died!

4490
03:08:14,330 --> 03:08:18,290
I literally avoided canon event!

4491
03:08:18,690 --> 03:08:20,430
Wait, that's so funny!

4492
03:08:20,710 --> 03:08:23,450
I actually saved his life!

4493
03:08:26,150 --> 03:08:29,050
He was actually gonna die there!

4494
03:08:29,270 --> 03:08:31,530
That's actually so funny!

4495
03:08:31,950 --> 03:08:33,730
Oh my god!

4496
03:08:35,010 --> 03:08:36,650
Holy shit!

4497
03:08:37,350 --> 03:08:39,030
That's so funny!

4498
03:08:39,070 --> 03:08:42,670
I can't believe I actually avoided his canon death!

4499
03:08:42,670 --> 03:08:45,150
Holy shit!

4500
03:08:47,970 --> 03:08:50,510
A canon event avoided!

4501
03:08:51,550 --> 03:08:53,210
I wanted to fish!

4502
03:08:54,030 --> 03:08:55,370
You guys did great!

4503
03:08:55,630 --> 03:08:58,010
You guys avoided the canon event!

4504
03:08:58,410 --> 03:09:00,010
We Spider-Man'd that shit!

4505
03:09:00,350 --> 03:09:01,470
You guys did amazing!

4506
03:09:03,130 --> 03:09:06,530
I still can't believe we actually avoided...

4507
03:09:06,530 --> 03:09:07,710
avoided it!

4508
03:09:10,390 --> 03:09:11,510
Where's the fishing?

4509
03:09:12,430 --> 03:09:14,370
I was told I can fish here!

4510
03:09:15,030 --> 03:09:15,550
Oh!

4511
03:09:15,670 --> 03:09:16,490
Let's go fishing!

4512
03:09:18,550 --> 03:09:19,590
Aww man!

4513
03:09:20,070 --> 03:09:21,370
Press A to try fishing...

4514
03:09:21,370 --> 03:09:22,710
to try choosing...

4515
03:09:22,710 --> 03:09:23,990
Okay, normal there.

4516
03:09:24,110 --> 03:09:24,690
How do I fish?

4517
03:09:29,150 --> 03:09:30,250
The fish comes...

4518
03:09:30,250 --> 03:09:31,310
The boy with twitch...

4519
03:09:31,310 --> 03:09:32,690
Press the polar...

4520
03:09:32,690 --> 03:09:35,190
If you try to do this before, fishing will be interrupted.

4521
03:09:36,010 --> 03:09:36,530
Okay.

4522
03:09:39,750 --> 03:09:41,850
Alright, press A with the right timing.

4523
03:09:42,370 --> 03:09:43,290
Where's the fish?

4524
03:09:44,470 --> 03:09:44,950
Oh!

4525
03:09:46,110 --> 03:09:46,590
Yay!

4526
03:09:46,990 --> 03:09:48,570
I got Digicarp!

4527
03:09:48,970 --> 03:09:50,630
Because it's not a real fish!

4528
03:09:52,370 --> 03:09:53,870
Oh, I can feed you guys!

4529
03:09:56,430 --> 03:09:57,290
Alright, level 2.

4530
03:09:57,470 --> 03:09:58,070
Oh my god!

4531
03:09:58,170 --> 03:09:59,210
Wizardmon is so strong!

4532
03:09:59,830 --> 03:10:00,370
Come on!

4533
03:10:03,630 --> 03:10:04,430
Go in there!

4534
03:10:06,450 --> 03:10:07,410
Jesus Christ!

4535
03:10:12,590 --> 03:10:13,750
I told you!

4536
03:10:14,250 --> 03:10:15,110
Tough love!

4537
03:10:15,270 --> 03:10:15,690
I told you!

4538
03:10:15,690 --> 03:10:16,430
Works!

4539
03:10:18,710 --> 03:10:19,910
Holy shit!

4540
03:10:25,230 --> 03:10:27,590
Dragon 3, tough love works!

4541
03:10:27,730 --> 03:10:28,950
Dragon 3, look at you!

4542
03:10:28,970 --> 03:10:30,010
Now you're so strong!

4543
03:10:31,030 --> 03:10:35,950
Now you're actually so fucking strong!

4544
03:10:36,170 --> 03:10:37,550
Jesus Christ!

4545
03:10:38,090 --> 03:10:39,150
What the fuck?

4546
03:10:39,450 --> 03:10:41,050
What the fuck happened?

4547
03:10:42,170 --> 03:10:45,050
You learned how to defend this brother!

4548
03:10:45,050 --> 03:10:46,470
Oh shit, we gotta head home!

4549
03:10:46,730 --> 03:10:47,890
Is there no food?

4550
03:10:47,990 --> 03:10:48,770
I have food!

4551
03:10:49,190 --> 03:10:49,330
Ready?

4552
03:10:49,730 --> 03:10:50,490
Oh no.

4553
03:10:51,370 --> 03:10:53,130
What do you mean is there no food?

4554
03:10:53,350 --> 03:10:54,270
You think...

4555
03:10:54,270 --> 03:10:57,930
You think mama would mistreat you guys like this?

4556
03:10:59,670 --> 03:11:02,030
Okay, I need to make sure we're both being fed.

4557
03:11:02,970 --> 03:11:04,110
You don't like this?

4558
03:11:06,250 --> 03:11:06,970
It's okay.

4559
03:11:07,130 --> 03:11:08,910
It's okay if you don't like this.

4560
03:11:12,630 --> 03:11:13,130
Alright.

4561
03:11:13,130 --> 03:11:14,390
Let's see.

4562
03:11:15,210 --> 03:11:16,310
Time to eat!

4563
03:11:16,710 --> 03:11:17,170
Time to eat!

4564
03:11:18,410 --> 03:11:19,050
Yay!

4565
03:11:22,780 --> 03:11:24,220
Alright, are you guys still hungry?

4566
03:11:24,840 --> 03:11:25,480
C'mon!

4567
03:11:25,480 --> 03:11:26,600
Don't worry, I have more meat.

4568
03:11:30,840 --> 03:11:33,740
Alright, I like how only uh...

4569
03:11:34,920 --> 03:11:37,000
I like how only ah...

4570
03:11:37,000 --> 03:11:38,840
Dragon 4 is happy.

4571
03:11:39,140 --> 03:11:41,380
Dragon 3 is just edgy as fuck.

4572
03:11:41,880 --> 03:11:42,520
Ahaha!

4573
03:11:43,100 --> 03:11:43,380
Ahaha!

4574
03:11:43,520 --> 03:11:44,160
Ahaha!

4575
03:11:44,600 --> 03:11:45,240
Uh...

4576
03:11:45,240 --> 03:11:45,880
Ahaha!

4577
03:11:45,980 --> 03:11:46,440
Ahaha!

4578
03:11:46,440 --> 03:11:46,620
Ahaha!

4579
03:11:46,620 --> 03:11:48,560
Something delicious is here?

4580
03:11:49,760 --> 03:11:50,400
What is?

4581
03:11:54,720 --> 03:11:55,600
What's hopping?

4582
03:11:57,720 --> 03:11:58,740
Did you guys hear that?

4583
03:12:00,620 --> 03:12:01,760
Is it Gatomon?

4584
03:12:03,420 --> 03:12:04,960
Is Gatomon hopping?

4585
03:12:05,700 --> 03:12:06,820
Is that your sound?

4586
03:12:09,020 --> 03:12:10,240
Alright, thank you for the super chat.

4587
03:12:10,300 --> 03:12:10,980
Thank you, thank you.

4588
03:12:11,020 --> 03:12:13,040
Speaking of food, please feed us and meal pets.

4589
03:12:13,140 --> 03:12:14,900
We're starving and dying of pox.

4590
03:12:14,940 --> 03:12:16,020
Thank you for the super chat.

4591
03:12:16,120 --> 03:12:16,600
Thank you, thank you.

4592
03:12:16,600 --> 03:12:17,920
You know what's funny?

4593
03:12:18,180 --> 03:12:23,860
I checked my inventory and so many people gifted me the medicine to cure Neopox.

4594
03:12:26,460 --> 03:12:30,580
Everybody was sending me the medicine to heal you guys.

4595
03:12:32,220 --> 03:12:35,140
And I... I didn't accept it.

4596
03:12:35,180 --> 03:12:37,040
I rejected the medicine.

4597
03:12:37,700 --> 03:12:46,460
Guys, I am trying to make sure you guys develop the right antibodies to fight off Neopox.

4598
03:12:46,600 --> 03:12:47,180
Chat.

4599
03:12:47,420 --> 03:12:56,020
If I just give you the medicine, then you're just never gonna develop the antibodies that will require you to fight it off.

4600
03:12:56,440 --> 03:12:58,920
You're just gonna be like a fucking bubble boy.

4601
03:13:02,520 --> 03:13:07,020
We're literally living the life of medieval peasants there.

4602
03:13:08,260 --> 03:13:10,040
You're literally in the hotel.

4603
03:13:10,180 --> 03:13:13,420
She's a natural medicine auntie.

4604
03:13:16,860 --> 03:13:17,420
No!

4605
03:13:19,880 --> 03:13:25,480
Okay, I'm gonna go... Okay, I'm gonna... I'm gonna... Okay, I'm gonna buy you the medicine.

4606
03:13:25,560 --> 03:13:27,680
I'm gonna buy you the medicine.

4607
03:13:28,200 --> 03:13:33,000
I'm gonna buy you the medicine, guys.

4608
03:13:33,360 --> 03:13:34,480
Alright, let's go to the gym.

4609
03:13:36,040 --> 03:13:40,200
Okay, you need to... You need more, I think, wisdom, right?

4610
03:13:41,140 --> 03:13:42,440
Alright, here we go.

4611
03:13:43,440 --> 03:13:44,000
No!

4612
03:13:44,060 --> 03:13:45,080
I failed it!

4613
03:13:45,080 --> 03:13:46,980
This is the first time I failed it!

4614
03:13:47,480 --> 03:13:50,980
Oh my god, this is actually the first time I've ever failed it.

4615
03:13:55,560 --> 03:13:57,140
Alright, time to train more.

4616
03:13:58,060 --> 03:13:59,580
You need speed as well?

4617
03:13:59,700 --> 03:13:59,920
Okay.

4618
03:14:04,020 --> 03:14:04,540
Alright.

4619
03:14:05,900 --> 03:14:06,420
Yeah!

4620
03:14:09,720 --> 03:14:11,060
Alright, sleepy time.

4621
03:14:11,160 --> 03:14:11,940
Sleep in the gym.

4622
03:14:14,160 --> 03:14:14,900
Sleepy time.

4623
03:14:15,640 --> 03:14:16,140
Yeah!

4624
03:14:21,470 --> 03:14:22,590
Some good sleep.

4625
03:14:22,730 --> 03:14:23,910
Alright, food time!

4626
03:14:24,050 --> 03:14:25,110
We're gonna eat food outside.

4627
03:14:25,530 --> 03:14:28,810
Cause mom doesn't have food anymore, so she gotta go to the soup kitchen.

4628
03:14:29,690 --> 03:14:30,770
Sorry, the meat kitchen.

4629
03:14:31,590 --> 03:14:32,090
Yay!

4630
03:14:32,230 --> 03:14:33,470
It's meat kitchen time!

4631
03:14:34,350 --> 03:14:35,950
Meat that grows from the ground.

4632
03:14:37,030 --> 03:14:38,130
Alright, let's see.

4633
03:14:39,570 --> 03:14:40,290
There you go.

4634
03:14:40,650 --> 03:14:41,850
You don't like that item?

4635
03:14:43,290 --> 03:14:44,010
It's okay.

4636
03:14:44,010 --> 03:14:45,550
It's okay to be picky.

4637
03:14:45,710 --> 03:14:46,630
You gotta have standards.

4638
03:14:49,870 --> 03:14:50,270
Yeah.

4639
03:14:51,110 --> 03:14:52,370
Anyway, eat it again.

4640
03:14:53,630 --> 03:14:54,350
Alright, nice.

4641
03:14:54,590 --> 03:14:54,950
Alright.

4642
03:14:56,650 --> 03:14:57,870
So like, when do they die?

4643
03:14:58,910 --> 03:15:00,790
How many days are they allowed to be alive?

4644
03:15:06,230 --> 03:15:09,370
I don't know if I want to see them die.

4645
03:15:09,930 --> 03:15:10,330
Like...

4646
03:15:11,110 --> 03:15:11,950
Oh, the age.

4647
03:15:12,310 --> 03:15:13,330
Oh, 14 days.

4648
03:15:13,450 --> 03:15:13,990
Oh, thank you.

4649
03:15:14,010 --> 03:15:14,130
Oh my god.

4650
03:15:14,350 --> 03:15:14,610
Okay.

4651
03:15:14,850 --> 03:15:15,830
14 days.

4652
03:15:15,990 --> 03:15:18,910
Okay, so technically, they can never die.

4653
03:15:19,210 --> 03:15:20,690
I can't believe it though.

4654
03:15:22,950 --> 03:15:25,010
I can't believe I actually...

4655
03:15:25,010 --> 03:15:26,530
I don't wanna digivolve them.

4656
03:15:27,750 --> 03:15:29,930
Alright, I think we'll call it here.

4657
03:15:34,630 --> 03:15:37,530
The fact that I saved wizard mod.

4658
03:15:37,690 --> 03:15:40,150
I can't believe I saved...

4659
03:15:40,150 --> 03:15:42,430
I don't want those guys to digivolve.

4660
03:15:42,510 --> 03:15:43,170
They're perfect!

4661
03:15:44,010 --> 03:15:45,450
They're actually perfect!

4662
03:15:45,910 --> 03:15:46,370
They're...

4663
03:15:49,630 --> 03:15:51,590
They're perfect as they are!

4664
03:15:52,310 --> 03:15:53,790
That's what I'm gonna call it here.

4665
03:15:54,830 --> 03:15:55,970
Oh my god.

4666
03:15:56,030 --> 03:15:58,110
That was really fun though.

4667
03:15:58,290 --> 03:15:59,470
I had a really fun time.

4668
03:16:00,130 --> 03:16:04,130
I still can't believe we got the cat.

4669
03:16:04,470 --> 03:16:07,970
We got Wizardmon and Gothamon.

4670
03:16:07,970 --> 03:16:10,730
I was not expecting Wizardmon at all.

4671
03:16:11,510 --> 03:16:12,670
I'm gonna save game.

4672
03:16:14,490 --> 03:16:15,910
Oh my god.

4673
03:16:16,010 --> 03:16:17,030
Yeah, I saved it.

4674
03:16:17,090 --> 03:16:17,690
I saved it.

4675
03:16:17,730 --> 03:16:18,590
I saved it guys.

4676
03:16:18,650 --> 03:16:19,030
Don't worry.

4677
03:16:19,250 --> 03:16:20,770
That's so funny though.

4678
03:16:20,830 --> 03:16:26,670
That I managed to get... and then I saved Wizardmon before he fucking got killed a third time.

4679
03:16:27,530 --> 03:16:28,550
You could...

4680
03:16:28,550 --> 03:16:31,190
He actually... it was this close.

4681
03:16:31,450 --> 03:16:39,350
It was actually this close that we could've got a Wizardmon death right after the digivolution.

4682
03:16:41,710 --> 03:16:42,350
Um...

4683
03:16:42,350 --> 03:16:44,090
The digibomb.

4684
03:16:44,130 --> 03:16:45,390
I can't believe it.

4685
03:16:46,750 --> 03:16:47,390
Um...

4686
03:16:47,390 --> 03:16:48,810
Kaz, thank you for the superchat.

4687
03:16:48,870 --> 03:16:49,470
Thank you, thank you.

4688
03:16:49,530 --> 03:16:54,610
We actually witnessed the origin story of OG Gothamon and Wizardmon right here.

4689
03:16:54,910 --> 03:16:56,130
Thank you for the superchat.

4690
03:16:56,190 --> 03:16:57,290
Thank you, thank you.

4691
03:16:57,450 --> 03:16:58,590
Half a second.

4692
03:16:58,690 --> 03:17:00,710
If we... if we let it...

4693
03:17:00,710 --> 03:17:05,710
If we like hesitated for one more second, Wizardmon would've been gone.

4694
03:17:06,170 --> 03:17:09,110
He would've actually been gone.

4695
03:17:09,730 --> 03:17:10,710
Oh my god.

4696
03:17:10,730 --> 03:17:11,390
Oh my god.

4697
03:17:15,510 --> 03:17:17,730
Guys, tough love made you so strong.

4698
03:17:17,970 --> 03:17:19,250
And now look at you!

4699
03:17:19,310 --> 03:17:21,830
You're even stronger than Gothamon!

4700
03:17:22,010 --> 03:17:22,830
That was crazy!

4701
03:17:23,510 --> 03:17:25,810
You literally like two shot...

4702
03:17:25,810 --> 03:17:27,450
You two shot people.

4703
03:17:28,310 --> 03:17:28,390
Uh...

4704
03:17:31,270 --> 03:17:31,670
Um...

4705
03:17:32,510 --> 03:17:33,870
Yeah, thank you for the superchat.

4706
03:17:33,950 --> 03:17:34,590
Thank you, thank you.

4707
03:17:34,670 --> 03:17:35,930
Rule one... Oh wait, sorry.

4708
03:17:36,070 --> 03:17:36,430
I read that.

4709
03:17:36,630 --> 03:17:37,090
But thank you again.

4710
03:17:37,770 --> 03:17:38,170
Um...

4711
03:17:39,030 --> 03:17:40,230
Yeah, thank you for the superchat.

4712
03:17:40,270 --> 03:17:40,870
Thank you, thank you.

4713
03:17:40,870 --> 03:17:44,750
Maybe Dragon 3 has only put in the same amount of work as the appreciation he received.

4714
03:17:44,910 --> 03:17:46,030
Thank you for the superchat.

4715
03:17:46,110 --> 03:17:47,190
Thank you, thank you.

4716
03:17:47,570 --> 03:17:48,550
Oh my god.

4717
03:17:48,610 --> 03:17:49,610
That's really fun though.

4718
03:17:49,790 --> 03:17:52,670
I had a really fun time playing Digimon World.

4719
03:17:52,990 --> 03:17:53,330
I...

4720
03:17:54,310 --> 03:17:55,970
I do wish it was...

4721
03:17:56,550 --> 03:17:59,870
Um... It was more similar to the original Digimon World.

4722
03:18:00,090 --> 03:18:05,410
Because the original Digimon World was like much... I don't know if it's cause like I need to travel more.

4723
03:18:05,510 --> 03:18:08,050
I feel like the original Digimon World, you'd never...

4724
03:18:08,050 --> 03:18:11,050
You didn't really have to live in the gym that much.

4725
03:18:14,940 --> 03:18:16,300
I feel like...

4726
03:18:16,300 --> 03:18:18,640
I feel like the original Digimon World...

4727
03:18:18,640 --> 03:18:21,900
Yeah, you didn't have to live in the gym for that long.

4728
03:18:21,980 --> 03:18:24,440
You can actually explore much... explore more.

4729
03:18:24,780 --> 03:18:25,760
Wait, you did?

4730
03:18:25,980 --> 03:18:27,100
You actually did?

4731
03:18:27,240 --> 03:18:27,880
I don't remember.

4732
03:18:28,260 --> 03:18:30,080
I think it's cause... um...

4733
03:18:30,080 --> 03:18:32,480
Was it actually... the original was so much harder?

4734
03:18:32,880 --> 03:18:35,820
Oh, that's why my Digimon kept dying.

4735
03:18:37,100 --> 03:18:37,660
Oh...

4736
03:18:37,660 --> 03:18:39,360
That makes more sense now.

4737
03:18:39,500 --> 03:18:40,660
Cause I didn't play the...

4738
03:18:40,660 --> 03:18:43,500
I was like way too young to be playing that game.

4739
03:18:43,940 --> 03:18:44,500
And...

4740
03:18:49,200 --> 03:18:50,600
So that's why...

4741
03:18:50,600 --> 03:18:52,720
Okay, that makes a lot more sense now.

4742
03:18:52,860 --> 03:18:54,860
I was not training my Digimon in the gym.

4743
03:18:55,020 --> 03:18:56,680
I was just exploring the world.

4744
03:18:56,840 --> 03:19:00,260
I was triggering some like uh... game events too.

4745
03:19:00,480 --> 03:19:07,280
Cause like... uh... if you visit the beach at one point, like a monster comes up and takes you to the other side of the island.

4746
03:19:07,440 --> 03:19:08,740
And I remember stuff like that.

4747
03:19:08,860 --> 03:19:11,820
Oh, that's why my Digimon was so underpowered.

4748
03:19:12,260 --> 03:19:13,060
Oh my god.

4749

03:19:13,180 --> 03:19:13,400

The world in Digimon World the original was like really interesting.

4765
03:19:39,580 --> 03:19:44,320
And like... I loved exploring around the environment cause I couldn't read cause it was all in Japanese.

4766
03:19:44,700 --> 03:19:51,940
But I loved like exploring the area and everything and like looking at the different uh... different Digimons uh... around the area.
