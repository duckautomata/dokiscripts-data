00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,240
Oh, yes.

10
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,080
That update.

11
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:39,900
So, after my Haudenosaunee stream, you know, I took him out for walkies and everything.

12
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,540
We had a little adventure.

13
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,920
During our walkies.

14
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,420
He took me, like, further.

15
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,040
You know, like, I don't know.

16
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,100
After Hall Night, I had the adrenaline in me.

17
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,160
And I was like, you know what?

18
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,180
Even though it's, like, 11 p.m., we're going to have a little adventure late at night.

19
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:58,940
I 11...

20
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:59,240
Okay.

21
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,540
The more I talk about it, the more I realize I really should not be alive.

22
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:06,840
Okay.

23
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,160
Anyway, I was like, it's 11 p.m.

24
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,700
Time to have a little adventure.

25
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,120
with my dog late at night.

26
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,540
It's in a very safe neighborhood, I think.

27
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,980
I just arrived.

28
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,820
It was 200 years ago.

29
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:27,000
My parents would abandon me in the forest because they would know I would not, it was not worth raising me.

30
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,760
It's okay.

31
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,500
I have dad there to protect me, my tiny ass dog.

32
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:38,460
And all he could do is just, I guess he would just bark them away.

33
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,360
Anyway.

34
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:45,000
Anyway, so I decided, I was like, oh man, I had a good holiday night.

35
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,120
She's like, I had a good silk song stream today.

36
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,320
Let me go out at 11 p.m.

37
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:57,780
to walk my dog and also, like, have a little adventure outside and explore a little bit of the neighborhood.

38
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,260
He's trying his best.

39
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:05,500
My old injured small dog will protect me, guys.

40
00:07:06,120 --> 00:08:06,000
It's not like he had one back surgery, another misaligned disc on his neck or anything and he is seven years old now but don't worry he'll protect me anyway so um during the during the walkies uh nah he'd win so during the walkies uh when i was you know he was doing his usual pee and poop but while he was pooping he had a little accident what kind of accident would you might you wonder so when he was pooping he somehow lost his balance i've never seen this before like seven years he somehow lost his balance in the middle of pooping fell to the side while he's still pooping got back up and then continue to poop.

41
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,930
What did you, how did you lose your balance?

42
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,930
oh, it was dark.

43
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,510
He could not see a donkey.

44
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,990
You decided to walk him at 11 p.m.

45
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,950
London Bridge is falling down.

46
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,330
Falling down.

47
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,690
Falling down.

48
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,190
And he like played it off.

49
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:35,570
It was like nothing happened.

50
00:08:35,750 --> 00:09:41,950
He was like, oh, I was just a regular old day for me uh but yes he literally like tipped over to his side because he lost he somehow i don't even know how he lost his balance it's mostly a flat floor it's mostly like a flat surface so i don't know what happened um i'm meant to do that anyway so uh and you expose him to everyone he thought it was a safe space dokey how dare you tell the story did he even sent to this he thought it was just a private moment between you and him and you had to tell the story to everyone that's messed up dokey not using him for content that poor old man i can't believe you would you would abuse the elderly like this for content Imagine if I exposed my kids a bathroom stories on stream.

51
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:43,230
Okay, yeah, anyway.

52
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,830
So, yeah, he, like, tipped over to the side.

53
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:49,210
And he just kept, he just got back up and just, he just, like, nothing happened.

54
00:09:52,510 --> 00:10:03,170
Anyway, while we were on our little late night, late night adventure, I was walking, you know, I was walking past down, like, several streets.

55
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:16,630
And when we were walking back, uh there was like a yeah i was walking past a grocery store um that's not near my place because we walked pretty far

56
00:10:21,190 --> 00:11:06,210
um and uh and so i heard a noise on in the trash can i was like the fuck is that like i was just like what the fuck is that noise and so dad i just stopped because i was like was there something in the trash can and out from the trash can came a little ratatouille a little a little fucking remy from ratatouille came out of the trash can um chucked up whatever the fuck he was holding he chucked it on the ground and then dropped down looked at dad and dad and dad was just like what the fuck because i was like what the fuck that was like what the fuck And then,

57
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,210
like, we were just looking at it.

58
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:11,590
And then he, like, picked up the food and just ran into the bushes.

59
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:14,810
And then Dad reacted.

60
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:16,190
But very slow reaction.

61
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:20,090
And then he fucking reacted after the rat ran away.

62
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,210
So I'm just like, what the fuck was that?

63
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:25,270
Like, oh, now you react.

64
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,510
What if that rat had a knife?

65
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:30,790
What?

66
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,610
What if he had a knife?

67
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:35,530
You're reacting after he runs away.

68
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:38,590
Like, yeah, you better run.

69
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,630
I was like, yeah, that's right.

70
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,750
He was shook.

71
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:44,370
Yeah, yeah.

72
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:47,510
I'm around with a knife.

73
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,050
Then he'd be out right.

74
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,890
He can't outrun me when I have him on the leash.

75
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:55,170
If anything, I'll pull him back and then I'll be in front.

76
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:59,150
Had to do a vibe check first.

77
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:07,610
I was like, I was like, you're supposed to bike with.

78
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,170
the rat comes up.

79
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:12,470
Not after the rat runs away, dad.

80
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:17,010
Like, he could have had a gun.

81
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:22,850
Excuse him for not reacting at freaking midnight.

82
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,430
Your poor poor dog.

83
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:26,930
Don't blame him.

84
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:33,170
He just has 300 MS ping from high to his leg and stay out.

85
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:34,410
Yeah, that's right.

86
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:35,290
Run.

87
00:12:36,530 --> 00:13:35,150
Um, but yeah, that was was my late night adventures uh with my dog um and we arrived safely home it might have been midnight but we were it was midnight but we were safely home guys you know i maybe i should not have had my little adventure at around 11 to midnight i think that was a very bad idea it's a miracle that I have survived this long with all my with all my quirky little ideas that I have then then you have the super chat thank you thank you when I lived in New York City the rats got into my protein powder I caught one and it was the size of a small dog holy fuck what that rat was fucking lifting weights holy shit I was on some goddamn steroids at that point.

88
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,070
Vela, welcome to Tomato Farm.

89
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:37,910
Welcome, welcome.

90
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,210
Oh yeah, apparently the plague is back.

91
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:49,470
Because I was telling this I was telling this rat story to one of my friends.

92
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:56,290
And then they were like, oh yeah, maybe they should kill off all the rats in that neighborhood.

93
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:56,950
That's not good.

94
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,750
I was like, oh, that's fucked up, bro.

95
00:13:59,250 --> 00:15:02,810
And then my friend was like, did you not hear the plague back i was like what and i was like what do you mean i thought the plague was just a thing in the medieval times we're in 2025 what what do you mean the plague is back i was so confused yeah so apparently um recently there was a case in california where um someone died from the plague the plague sequel yeah and so um so like yeah a woman died in california it's just california things but a woman died in california from the plague i'm like but how just like how is it i guess we forget that it was supposed to be gone how did it it's like measles like we just some people just stopped it doing stop being vaccinated to measles and just came back.

96
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,570
I was just like, they could do that.

97
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,430
They could just come back.

98
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:10,150
What's the point of having it eradicated if it just comes back?

99
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,070
That is not eradication.

100
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:15,730
It was just on a very long vacation.

101
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:19,710
Like instead of eradication, it was just on a vacation.

102
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:22,250
And it just, it can just come back.

103
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:26,170
Like, I, can we get rid of California?

104
00:15:30,730 --> 00:16:02,310
Yeah, so um so yeah anyway so that's how i found out that's just another new fear of mine i just found out that the plague can just come back now and it could be it could come to any one of and there's rats in my neighborhood so that's really good news there's apparently a bunch of rats in my neighborhood and the plague is back so um let's just Oh,

105
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:07,170
none of the rats there are like carriers for the plague.

106
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:16,030
Rabies is way worse, but to get rabies, you just gotta be bit by a wild animal.

107
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:18,830
And as long as I don't go outside, that's never gonna happen.

108
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:23,330
And I know dad doesn't have rabies, so he won't fucking give me rabies.

109
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:26,070
You will be missed.

110
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:30,230
It's just a little plague, Toki.

111
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,590
Everything will be fine.

112
00:16:33,990 --> 00:17:47,070
No, I don't go to the dog park anymore Because they put a curfew at the dog park And then they were like If we find you Because sometimes I go to the dog park At like 3 in the morning To take dad for walkies If I'm having a late Super late night of work And they recently put a curfew At the dog park And they're like If we see you Going to the dog park After this time you will be fine and we have cameras and then i was like well guess i'm fucking not going to the dog park anymore so so i haven't been at a dog park here for a while ever since they um do not go to the dog park at three in the morning it was very safe though that was the reason why i went to the dog part during late at night because like it was because like I couldn't go to the dog part through um um the passageway through my apartment so like my apartment had like a small passageway to the dog part which and then like all I had to do was just go outside for just a little bit and then I'll be there um so that's why I felt

113
00:17:47,070 --> 00:18:54,670
like very safe going there but then now now they're like oh we have a curfew because apparently it wasn't just me guys other people were also going to the dog park after like after like 11 p.m um and because of that the neighbors like the people who were like who were like uh stationed who were living like close to the dog park were were like complaining about it because apparently there were some very rowdy dogs at the dog park um after 11 p.m and so they had to be more strict with the curfew and i know it wasn't me and dad because dad says nothing unless unless there's another dog he doesn't care he just does his thing and then leaves and there's no other dog at three in the morning so i i know that we weren't the problem because there's no other dogs at three in the morning at the dog part so like we weren't the ones that caused the curfew so i don't know a gang of dogs like was just being way too rowdy late at night um so so i i that means that there were other dogs that were

114
00:18:54,670 --> 00:19:15,570
barking and causing a scene you know the use that the there were other use that the dog part that were causing a scene the dog crew um that were giving noise complaints to the neighbors so now that now that they put a curfew they're like and they're like we have cameras and we will find you and we find who you are.

115
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,290
I was like, oh, I don't risk that.

116
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,870
So I just like, I don't take him to the dog park anymore.

117
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:22,390
And anyway, he doesn't, can't even play fetch anyway.

118
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:25,690
So the only reason why I go to a dog park was just to play fetch with him.

119
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:38,330
Um, but now that he's like, you know, he's like that, that's SpongeBob character in, uh, that SpongeBob character where he's like, if I breathe, I snap 20 bones in my body.

120
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:46,870
Now that dad is like that, there's no reason to go like, Like, yeah, 10th date of third time.

121
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,190
I can't go to the dog park.

122
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:51,830
I can't really go to the dog park anymore and play fetch because, like, I don't want to risk anything.

123
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,990
Anyway, it's Minecraft time.

124
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,850
That was a dad update for today.

125
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:01,790
And also, like, a concern for all of you guys about my...

126
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:10,870
Another concern for you guys about my lack of survival and things.

127
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:11,770
Oh, yeah.

128
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:14,050
This is very out of topic.

129
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:28,690
Um, I really want to show you guys this picture because I don't keep up with Pokemon anymore and I really I literally thought this was a shitpost like but for those who don't keep up with Pokemon anymore like this is a real Pokemon design.

130
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:41,190
I this was apparently for Pokemon Sword and Shield and it's like what the villain what is it is it the villains for Sword.

131
00:20:45,290 --> 00:21:13,150
style is based upon uh pokemon sword and shield so they're like how do we make them how do we make them look like you know represent a sword and shield why don't we just make the hair i thought they were the pokemon that yeah turkey it's a miracle you're still alive at this point You're good.

Sword bird and shield bird.

00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,690
There's no way.

165
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,470

Oh, you know what's even sad?

170
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:21,650
When they try to make a trainer card for them and they try to keep it very serious.

171
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,490
The artist tried so hard.

172
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:31,390
You know this artist was trying so hard to make this card even remotely look good.

173
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:35,690
God, they're stupid people.

176
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,930
We all have to play a part, guys.

177
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:49,810
There's no exceptions in Doki Land.

178
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:51,750
All right, let's see.

179
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:58,250
Unless you're the rich, then, like, your tax, uh, then, then don't worry about it.

180
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:59,130
Don't worry about it.

I will say that I do indeed take bribes.

184
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:49,070
A corrupt government is a good government.

185
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:59,030
Like, I like how his hair is super floppy because they're like, no, we still have to figure out the physics in Pokemon hair.

186
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:02,170
All right, let's actually play Minecraft.

00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:27,310
Hello.

196
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:30,510
Proceed.

197
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:33,050
I'll have to download a custom pack.

198
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:33,750

199
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:34,390

King Doki Bird is here.

204
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:47,050
That's right.

205
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:49,170
Long live the king.

206
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:51,750

Thank you, everybody.

209
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:56,950
Why do I have a German flag?

210
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:58,430
Oh, I forgot.

211
00:26:58,530 --> 00:26:58,710

212
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,650

00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:05,130
I keep forgetting.

214
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:07,150
Emperor Doki Bac...

00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:10,470

00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:12,750
What is this?

218
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:15,250

219
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:16,550

220
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:17,830
Oh, okay, it's just a hook.

221
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:20,770
Don't worry.

222
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:23,910
Emperor Joke-Bird has returned from the lands.

223
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:28,010
Here to collect the taxes from the people.

224

Put some shoes on.

228
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:39,230
Now they will never know.

229
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:41,270
They'll never know where I am.

230
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:42,490
Alright, let's see.

00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:43,950

00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,580
Wait, I can't fly.

331
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,240

Wait, but it says it doesn't.

339
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:42,850
I can't claim anything here.

340
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:44,670
Excuse me?

341
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:48,750
Why does it say I can't claim anything?

342
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:50,970
Oh my god.

343
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:54,330
Okay, apparently...

344
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:55,470

00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:05,810
I know the way of Doki land, alright?

349
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:08,570
I'm not out of touch.

350
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:10,090
Of my own kingdom.

351
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:12,270
Why can't I fly anymore?

352
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:17,470

353
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:18,350

00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:22,570

Alright.

360
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:32,670
I will find a land.

361
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,830
Surely there would be a land.

362
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:38,910
Okay, wilderness.

363
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:41,270
Parkour civilization?

364
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:44,050
Who fucking lives here?

365
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:47,590
Why is there?

366
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,970
There's parkour civilization.

367
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:51,490
Okay.

368
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:53,610
Maybe here?

369
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:54,750
Okay, no.

370
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:55,610
Pixel lives here.

371
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:56,810
There's a tree house.

372
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:58,310
There's a wilderness.

373
00:36:58,590 --> 00:36:59,610
There's Aziz land.

374
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:00,190
Again?

375
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:01,930
How many lands do you have?

376
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:03,650

377
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:04,330

378
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:04,730
Okay.

379
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,610
There's Aziz land again.

380
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:07,410
Wait, here!

381
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:07,950

382
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:08,730
Oh, shit.

383
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:12,830
Wait, nobody has this claim on this land.

384
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,290
I'll claim here.

385
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,590

386
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:19,150

00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,370
Okay, this is a little awkward.

00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:24,050

393
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:34,830
Wait, what?

394
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:38,930
I can't claim one more chunk for this land.

00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:45,670
Give me more land.

398
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,790
Toki demands more land.

399
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:54,870
Okay, wait, how do I...

400
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:55,170

I got more land.

403
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:01,090
See, all you gotta do is just yell mods.

404
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:02,530
Wait, whoops, L map.

405
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:06,350
Alright, where is it?

406
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:09,310
Wait, did people claim my stuff?

407
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:36,910

408
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:38,270
That's right.

409
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:39,710
TP me back.

410
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:42,550
Teach them my lesson.

411
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:45,930
TP me back to my...

412
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:49,970
I was trying to figure out how to clean my land.

413
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:53,890
Banish them for 24 hours.

414
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:55,790
Let them...

415
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:56,310
No, okay.

416
00:39:56,610 --> 00:40:00,130
In the future, what we should do in the future is...

417
00:40:00,130 --> 00:41:04,990
If Cloud Nord would let us, we should create a temporary server where it's like a solitary confinement and then we just banish them into that solitary confinement just making a giant white block house and everything and then like just force them to stay in there for 24 hours every time they log in and then or the only way to get out of get out of that land is to force them to is to make them um write a in a journal about what they did wrong and then have to be pre and then and then the and one of the mods will have to read um the journal and see if they learn their lesson and i think that that morally is the right thing to do all right uh anyone that kills me will get a temporary ban while i'm trying to claim this land all right i'm just saying i don't even know where i was claiming.

418
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:11,090
Like, where... Where was I claiming land?

419
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:12,930
I don't even remember.

420
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:17,230
Where is my land?

421
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:19,130
Where did it go?

422
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,640
Okay, um, map.

00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:55,930
Wait, I can't...

433
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,370
Okay, whoever kills me dies.

434
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:58,290
Just saying.

435
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:00,610

00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:44,790
Oh, there's no claimed lands?

492
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:46,030
A map.

494
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:48,550

495
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:52,890
I'm trying to learn my own server.

496
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:56,050
Trying to figure this out.

497
00:45:56,690 --> 00:45:58,590
Where is that area that I claimed?

498
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:02,550
I claimed some fucking random patch of land and I don't know where.

499
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:05,470
Where is this random patch of land.

500
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:10,130
I claim a map.

501
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:12,630
Oh, hey, I can claim this.

502
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:13,930
I'll claim this.

503
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:15,210
Oh, failure.

504
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:21,230
Oakle is 25.

505
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:24,230
Why can't I claim it?

506
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:28,360
Oakle.

507
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:30,320
Who the fuck is Oakle?

508
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:32,520
Is that my land?

509
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,080
Doki land.

510
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:43,680
Oh.

511
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,000
Oh, I don't have money.

512
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,240
What the fuck?

513
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:49,480
Why don't I have money?

514
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,320
Why don't I have money?

515
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,340
I'm a god.

516
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,880
How do I not have money?

517
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,220
I'm a god.

518
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,840
I don't understand.

519
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:07,800
I am a god.

520
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:10,020
Wait.

521
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,140
I'm in someone else's land.

522
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:18,680
What the fuck?

523
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,400
Who the fuck is Oak all?

524
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,980
Oh, Darius Oak?

525
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:27,020
Oh, I'm sorry.

526
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,960
I... Oh, I'm so sorry.

527
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:33,140
I've... I'm in some random person's area.

528
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,700
Who the fuck is Darius Oak?

529
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:41,560
Who are you and why do you have... Why am I part of your society?

530
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:45,980
I... No, I gave you...

531
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:49,000
Oops, sorry.

532
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:55,220
Leave my society, Oak!

533
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,820
I'm gonna unclaim your land now.

534
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,140
I mean, I can't claim this.

535
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:03,640
Unclaimed.

536
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:07,400
That's right, I'm unclaiming your land.

537
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,020
Wait, L.A., okay.

538
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:13,820
Unclaimed.

539
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:17,840
Unclaim.

540
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,420
I'll claim all your lands.

541
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:21,240
Oh, nice.

542
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:21,600
Oops.

543
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:22,160
Sorry.

544
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:22,780
Oh, cool.

545
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:23,540
Sorry.

546
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,180
I'm not sorry.

547
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:29,260
I... That's right.

548
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:33,280
If you trust me on your land, I will unclaim your land.

549
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,460
Don't test me.

550
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,380
Don't test this god.

551
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:37,440
Okay.

552
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:39,180
El map.

553
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:41,180
All right.

554
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:41,840
Now.

555
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:45,400
Yay.

556
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:46,500
Wait.

557
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:50,300
Is this O'Kill?

558
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:52,240
Darius?

559
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,100
Wait, why am I still part of your land?

560
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:57,260
This land isn't looking for new members.

561
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:58,240
What the fuck?

562
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,520
I actually claimed this land again.

563
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,780
Oh my god, that's it.

564
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:03,520
Is this also...

565
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,160
Okay, okay.

566
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:05,220
Unclaimed.

567
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:07,800
Unclaimed.

568
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:13,560
Unclaimed.

569
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,080
How dare you?

570
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:17,520
This is gonna be...

571
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:19,940
My land, Toki, no.

572
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:23,600
Alright, nice.

573
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:27,260
Okay, now that that's gone, who's here?

574
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:28,200
Who is here?

575
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:32,500
Okay, this is a random unclaim.

576
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,800
Do L delete land name trust?

577
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:41,120
Oh, L delete oak hole.

578
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:43,600
Wait, does that delete everything?

579
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:45,680
Oh, trust.

580
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:47,020
Okay, there you go.

581
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:50,780
Oko trust.

582
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:53,860
I was about to delete this entire person's place.

583
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:58,040
Wait.

584
00:49:58,940 --> 00:49:59,960
Land solidly.

585
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:01,460
Oko confirmed.

586
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,720
Oh, you should not have trusted me, Oko.

587
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,680
I could have deleted your entire land claim.

588
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:12,840
Okay.

589
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:14,240
Map.

590
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:16,960
Is this mine now?

591
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,480
Why am I still claiming land for Orkul?

592
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:23,100
Who is he?

593
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:29,120
Get me out of your society!

594
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:33,660
Why am I still claiming land for you?

595
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:37,820
Get out!

596
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:43,380
No way, you're nowhere near me.

597
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,120
Do slash edit.

598
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:46,300
Slash.

599
00:50:46,960 --> 00:51:18,400

601
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,020
Oh my god, I've actually put it now.

602
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,340
Nobody can get my storage.

603
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,880
I need to use the bathroom.

604
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:32,360
Your back, guys.

605
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:19,980
Emperor is back.

606
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:22,900
Okay, how do I put the storage below?

607
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:26,100
I think it's a little inconvenient.

608
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:27,340
Just a little.

609
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,940
Oh, just a little bit.

610
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:35,120
Let's see.

611
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:39,560
How do I...

612
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,960
Okay, I own all of this, right?

613
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,040
Oh, no, these are the wilderness.

614
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:46,060
Okay, oh.

615
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,820
Oh, I guess I own that random paw area, too.

616
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,580
So how do I...

617
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:55,820
Slash, edit, do L, set, spawn?

618
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,540
Okay, I'll set spawn right here.

619
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:02,380
Set L slash set spawn.

620
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:02,820
spot.

621
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:05,520
I'm not out of touch with my people.

622
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:09,580
Oh my gosh, am I lagging?

623
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:10,740
Why am I lagging?

624
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:13,440
Why am I lagging?

625
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:16,600
Okay, what is causing my lag?

626
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:19,800
Okay, wait.

627
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:21,020
I gotta figure this out.

628
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:24,060
Have I been lagging this entire time?

629
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:27,540
Okay, details.

630
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:32,940
Oh, I have?

631
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:40,430
Okay, did I set my spawn?

632
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:41,250
Where is it?

633
00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:42,890
Wait, where did my thing go?

634
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:44,730
Is it still up top?

635
00:55:44,930 --> 00:55:45,310
Okay.

636
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:47,610
Uh.

637
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:51,410
Okay.

638
00:55:52,430 --> 00:55:53,070
There we go.

639
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:57,800
Alright.

640
00:55:58,600 --> 00:55:59,660
Let's set spawn.

641
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:05,120
Slash, set, spell, set, spawn.

642
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:10,470
Cost.

643
00:56:10,990 --> 00:56:11,590
Zero dollars.

644
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:14,330
Yes, I have that money.

645
00:56:14,790 --> 00:56:16,270
L-edit.

646
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:19,330
L-set spawn.

647
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:21,990
What do you mean?

648
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:22,950
It costs $0.

649
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:24,670
Let me set my spawn!

650
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:31,270
Remove this!

651
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,580
This I don't understand!

652
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:43,580
Alright, video settings.

653
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:47,140
Maybe I'll set my frame weight.

654
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,700
Why do I have 240 on 4?

655
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:53,980
Fucking...

656
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:54,600
Wait.

657
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:55,720
Reduce.

658
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:57,360
FPS.

659
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:58,280
Use no anime.

660
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,220
Only use entity.

661
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:03,340
And use not inside a visible chunk.

662
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:05,860
CP.

663
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:06,500
I don't know.

664
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:07,760
I can't read any of this.

665
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:09,300
I can't break it.

666
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:11,360
Land.

667
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:11,960
Open.

668
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,720
I'm trying to put this at the bottom.

669
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:17,940
I can't put this.

670
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:19,020
I don't know why I'm lagging.

671
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:40,710
