1
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,070
Hey guys, I've fucked up a little bit.

2
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,990
You guys don't hear it right now, but I'm actually on a call at the moment.

3
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:05,550
Okay, so I didn't realize when they said play test, it's predetermined.

4
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:06,830
Okay, sorry, I need to listen to this.

5
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,490
I don't know if I'm allowed to let you guys hear this right now.

6
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:24,450
Okay, they're talking about the play test right now, and I don't know if you guys are supposed to hear this, so I muted it.

7
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,490
I fucked up a little bit.

8
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:32,630
I didn't even do the tutorial!

9
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,490
I am so fucked!

10
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:42,310
I don't know if you guys are supposed to listen on.

11
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:46,210
It's an FPS... they're saying it's an FPS game.

12
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,430
And that's complicated.

13
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,970
I don't know if I'm supposed to say that.

14
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,930
It is not an extraction shooter, apparently.

15
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,890
Oh, thank god I didn't let you guys listen to this.

16
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:10,950
It's capture the flag.

17
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,830
It's a capture the flag game.

18
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,230
Oh

19
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,140
my god, they're watching my stream!

20
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,200
Oh, okay, you guys can hear it, by the way.

21
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:42,860
Okay, they were listening on my stream, and they were like, Hey, Doki on her stream was asking if you could, if we could, like, stream this part.

22
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,940
Alright, you guys can hear this.

23
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,980
I don't think anybody else has, so NDAs, there's nothing you can do.

24
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,780
No one wants to talk about this game as freely as you want.

25
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,620
But, back to it.

26
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,940
We're not an extraction shooter.

27
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:53,800
We're not an exfil.

28
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:57,240
It's not like DMZ or Tarkov where you go in, pick shit up...

29
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,240
That's not good for me.

30
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,600
All you need to do is go into the match.

31
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,720
You all start the same.

32
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,800
All you need to do is go into the match.

33
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:02,800
You all start the same.

34
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,360
You all have unique weapons.

35
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,620
You all have the same exact weapon.

36
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,940
By the way, guys, I'm muted, so they should have heard me say this.

37
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,580
And you go in, capture a biocore, defend it from everybody else who wants to steal it from you, and then get the hell out.

38
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:12,660
That's about it.

39
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,460
The tutorial should have kind of walked you through a couple of things.

40
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,260
I didn't do the tutorial, guys.

41
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,880
The devs that's listening to this, I didn't do the tutorial.

42
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,760
I didn't realize it was teams.

43
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,820
Like, I've been replaying with other players in this grid.

44
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:30,160
My biggest recommendation here is don't just WP the fuck out of there and go straight to the objective.

45
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,120
Pick a little bit of time to smell the roses.

46
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,860
Kill some snails.

47
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,740
Break their shells.

48
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,220
I didn't realize we're starting exactly at six, guys.

49
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,080
I thought I had some time.

50
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,920
I thought I had time.

51
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,120
So you do have respawns in here, guys.

52
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,000
So it's not a one and done.

53
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,020
We're not a battle royale.

54
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,880
You do respawn with three lives.

55
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,780
So you can find more around the map.

56
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,040
You get them as you find biocores as well.

57
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,700
But other than that, that's all I'm going to yap about.

58
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,720
Those are my two hints.

59
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,820
You're going to be assigned some players who are going to be community members with us.

60
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,960
So they've been playing for roughly about a year now.

61
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,700
They've seen the game in many stages.

62
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,800
And they know exactly how to kind of lead you in the right direction.

63
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,060
It's improv.

64
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,780
We're going to bring those people in here right now.

65
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,060
We're going in raw with reactions.

66
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,540
Thank you.

67
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:20,200
And what we're going to do is we're going to assign you some of these players that you're going to be on their team.

68
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,480
So some of them are little shy guys, you know, little silly guys.

69
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,520
They may not be able to chat and yap like I can.

70
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,880
But again, just follow their lead.

71
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,140
Ask them questions.

72
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,300
They'll be happy to help you out.

73
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:37,480
Now, questions by chance from anybody here that has not played.

74
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,600
Guys, I don't have questions, right?

75
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,960
We're just going to figure it out as we go along.

76
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,900
I'm currently going through a tutorial right now.

77
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,240
Oh, thank God.

78
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:45,820
It's not me.

79
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,940
But I won't admit it.

80
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,600
Are you okay?

81
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:50,620
Are you okay?

82
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,320
Yes.

83
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,460
Just dealing with the children.

84
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,980
I won't admit it in a room full of people.

85
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,180
I'll tell it to you guys.

86
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,280
Which is more than the room full of people that's in this room.

87
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:01,620
It's totally fine.

88
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,640
I'm sure we'll have some throughout gameplay.

89
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,200
I'm okay telling you guys I didn't do the tutorial because you guys know me.

90
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,680
So I'm going to start assigning some things here.

91
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:12,080
But before I do that, admit that you're going through the tutorial right now.

92
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,200
Who here is still going through the tutorial and has not completed the tutorial?

93
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,880
I haven't done the tutorial yet.

94
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,280
I'm in the middle of it.

95
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,660
I'm reading Power right now.

96
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,780
Okay, I said it.

97
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,860
I said it.

98
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,220
I said it.

99
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:30,700
It's me.

100
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,840
I raised my hand.

101
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:35,540
That's fair.

102
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,400
Are you completed with the tutorial as well?

103
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,520
Or are you still going through it?

104
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,520
Yeah, I'm completing the tutorial.

105
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,260
I'm just waiting in the main menu or lobby, I guess you'd say.

106
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,160
Cash money.

107
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:44,800
All right, cool.

108
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,760
So we're going to give it a little bit of time for everyone to complete the tutorial.

109
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,960
I didn't do the homework.

110
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,240
I didn't do the homework.

111
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:49,840
In the meantime...

112
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,260
My dog ate my homework.

113
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,640
There's going to be like a weird awkward pause here.

114
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,760
I wasn't the only one.

115
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,880
The other guy admitted it too.

116
00:06:59,440 --> 00:06:59,840
So I'm going to give it a little bit of time for everyone to complete the tutorial.

117
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,840
I don't need questions, but I'm like anticipating them.

118
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,500
So you don't have to have questions, but I won't be hurt if you don't.

119
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:18,760
I will ask a question to just since it seems like you are eager about questions is were you guys inspired by Vanilla Psycho at all by any chance?

120
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,720
The fuck is that?

121
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:24,220
We have a lot of people on the team who were inspired by Psycho.

122
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,680
If anything, you'll see a lot of things in inspiration from mini games.

123
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,820
Such as Psycho, such as Hunt Showdown.

124
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,860
I know that!

125
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,300
I don't know Hunt Showdown.

126
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,560
The fuck is Vanilla Psycho?

127
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,600
The Psycho!

128
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,340
Oh!

129
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:41,620
Oh!

130
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,500
The Psycho!

131
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,060
I played that!

132
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,940
I was like Vanilla Psycho?

133
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,180
Is that a rap song?

134
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,800
The goal isn't to W key and get kills.

135
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,780
Winning is acquiring...

136
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,380
Didn't he shut down?

137
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,380
Oh, I shouldn't say that.

138
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,920
I shouldn't say that.

139
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,540
Have you ever...

140
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,500
Have you ever watched or played Vanilla the Psycho?

141
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,500
I know that the Psycho Frontiers was the one that was similar to Tarkov.

142
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:10,880
But I don't know how many people actually know about Vanilla Psycho before it turned into...

143
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:10,920
The fuck?

144
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,040
There's more than one?

145
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,400
Man, let me tell you...

146
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,700
Am I supposed to do a tutorial while they're doing Q&A?

147
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,480
I don't know what my place is.

148
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,500
So a lot of people...

149
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,980
A lot of people are definitely inspired by...

150
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,020
Am I supposed to do the tutorial while they're doing a Q&A?

151
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,280
Oh, shit!

152
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,180
Okay, guys, I'm gonna do the tutorial.

153
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,460
Guys, okay, we're...

154
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,500
I'm sorry, we're going straight...

155
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,240
I can't even play the tutorial!

156
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:42,200
As you said, the objective isn't to W key people, it's to kill people.

157
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,660
Every part of Vanilla Psycho was that.

158
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,580
I don't... I can't...

159
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:53,360
I was really only to halt them from doing their PvE missions.

160
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,180
Because you could be a PvE god and win every match.

161
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:56,640
Wait, let me...

162
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,500
Maybe if I reboot it, maybe...

163
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,720
Maybe if I reboot the game, maybe...

164
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,240
Maybe it's me, I'm the problem.

165
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,160
I'm just gonna assume I'm the problem.

166
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,380
How did he get in the tutorial?

167
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,180
How did he...

168
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,820
It's not that we cater to that specific side of players, it's just...

169
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,920
That's where the core audience...

170
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,160
How did they get in the tutorial?

171
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,220
And I didn't!

172
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,940
Not make it just a PvPvE.

173
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:29,960
Right.

174
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,420
We still have the PvE in there.

175
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:31,560
Okay.

176
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,160
You're going to see cool bosses in there.

177
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,260
Don't worry, everything is okay, guys.

178
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,240
Don't worry.

179
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,180
They're in there, but it's not the cool...

180
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,100
Everything is...

181
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:39,820
Alienware?

182
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,540
Oh, Alienware sponsored this.

183
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,920
...PvE related as well.

184
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,180
From the numerous NPCs you see around here.

185
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:45,500
Okay.

186
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,860
Maybe I got access while I was...

187
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,120
Oh, there it is!

188
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:50,600
I...

189
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,040
What?

190
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,660
Okay.

191
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:53,580
Um...

192
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:54,900
Hey!

193
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,180
In the middle of the tutorial?

194
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,120
Yes.

195
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,800
I can't seem to get into the tutorial since I don't have access.

196
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,540
You don't have...

197
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,140
Let me see here.

198
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:04,420
All right.

199
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:04,820
Are you...

200
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,840
You're streaming right now.

201
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,200
Yeah.

202
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,720
Did you put in the beta branch code into the Steam properties?

203
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,440
I was not given that.

204
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,140
I just got a...

205
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,200
I can send it to you now.

206
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,080
I just got a code...

207
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,960
A key, and then that was all I got.

208
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,200
That's all I got for the game.

209
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,260
Okay.

210
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,060
It wasn't me.

211
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:23,460
Tell me.

212
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:23,560
Tell me.

213
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,700
It wasn't me.

214
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,480
Yeah.

215
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,200
I did my job.

216
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,180
I provided everything.

217
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,360
I literally got a code from...

218
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:29,820
Just kidding.

219
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,140
Just kidding.

220
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:30,680
No, no.

221
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,520
It's just things happen.

222
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,280
I got a code from somebody, and then they...

223
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,360
The way that y'all had access to the game was like...

224
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:35,520
That was it.

225
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,540
It wasn't my fault.

226
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,600
What the fuck is all this?

227
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,820
So, totally understand if it was a little bit confusing.

228
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:40,960
Or if you just didn't...

229
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,180
Oh.

230
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,220
I do have another question.

231
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,680
How did you guys go about...

232
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,980
There's a branch key?

233
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,980
...selecting content creators?

234
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:47,660
Okay.

235
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,920
Full transparency.

236
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,360
We go through a lot of creators that we can't select.

237
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:53,540
So...

238
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,300
How do I...

239
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:54,860
And also...

240
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,600
What do I do?

241
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:55,880
...look through...

242
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,460
I think it was, what?

243
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,320
Steam charts as well?

244
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,200
I don't get a message.

245
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,000
Streamer charts.

246
00:10:59,180 --> 00:10:59,940
Where's the message?

247
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,660
There is a lot of people that we can't select.

248
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:08,440
And there's a lot of people that we just kind of look at what kind of games that they're playing and send them an invite on the off chance that they're interested.

249
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,440
That's awesome.

250
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,280
I think...

251
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,640
Full transparency.

252
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,440
Again, people have done that where they've never heard of us.

253
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:20,760
And to be quite frankly, there's people we've never heard of that we're happy to meet in a scenario like this.

254
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,560
We do these...

255
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,000
Right.

256
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,200
I want to say every single week.

257
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:23,680
Where is it?

258
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,940
Fridays and Saturdays.

259
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:25,820
Today is a little bit of a day.

260
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,400
Oh, there it is.

261
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:26,840
Okay.

262
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,040
I got added.

263
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:28,480
Okay.

264
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,340
I was like...

265
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:29,920
Where is it?

266
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,520
Where do I put this?

267
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,320
Oh, there you go.

268
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:33,960
Okay.

269
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,280
Yes.

270
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:36,820
Opt into...

271
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,480
Oh, there you go.

272
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,020
I'm in.

273
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,980
Now to update the game.

274
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,160
9.87 gigabytes?

275
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:45,940
Guys...

276
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,600
But I was always interested in knowing...

277
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,700
This is going to cut in and out, guys.

278
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,180
This is going to cut in and out.

279
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:51,980
There's an endless number of...

280
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:52,760
9.87?

281
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,740
I wonder if it's like a range.

282
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,440
Guys, the stream might buffer, maybe.

283
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,660
The stream might buffer.

284
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:00,820
No.

285
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,880
Are you guys scouting it?

286
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,000
Guys, the stream is going to...

287
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,300
No, no.

288
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:06,600
I'm going to...

289
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,000
The stream and Discord might buffer.

290
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,120
That's what some of our employees are designed to do.

291
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,620
That's what I did for a solid year.

292
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,320
I worked...

293
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:14,880
All right.

294
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,160
Don't worry.

295
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,260
It's going in.

296
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,540
We're at three gigabytes.

297
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:19,880
We're at...

298
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,320
Yeah.

299
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,300
We're at three gigabytes.

300
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:21,960
What do we have?

301
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,800
We're gonna piece this together.

302
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:29,200
We're gonna... You guys helped me piece together this conversation.

303
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:30,920
We pooled a list of creators.

304
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,460
We looked at the game they played.

305
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,420
Depending on where we are at with the development.

306
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,160
It's a puzzle, isn't it?

307
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,600
It's a puzzle right now.

308
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,500
It would specifically resonate with us.

309
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:46,880
Right.

310
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,800
And you know, both of us are gonna be game after this.

311
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,460
We want to be able to...

312
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,380
For those who don't know what the fuck is going on.

313
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,040
I got invited to a playtest.

314
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,800
Somebody messaged me asking if I want to do the playtest.

315
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,680
And I was like, sure.

316
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,760
And they're like, oh they just want to see how you vibe.

317
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,620
And then maybe there's more opportunities in the future.

318
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,280
And I was like, yeah sure.

319
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,540
I don't mind.

320
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,960
And then I just was given a key and that was it.

321
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:13,300
And I was like, join the discord and here's the key.

322
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,240
And I was like, cool.

323
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:14,780
Sweet.

324
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,480
I didn't realize there was more.

325
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,320
There was more to this playtest.

326
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,140
I didn't realize how in-depth the playtest was.

327
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,420
I thought I'd just show up and stream it.

328
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,440
Instructors were definitely unclear.

329
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,420
Anyway, have you guys pieced this conversation together?

330
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,140
Because I have no idea what's going on.

331
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,540
I'm trying to fucking get the game to work.

332
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,260
I didn't do my homework.

333
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,660
Hello fellow playtesters.

334
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,260
I did not do my homework.

335
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,100
I'm just here.

336
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,260
That's one thing that we're doing.

337
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,480
And in the past we've also done, what do you call it?

338
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,020
Immortalization projects as well.

339
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,600
Instruction unclear.

340
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,880
Downloading the game again.

341
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,060
Firing range area.

342
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,540
Above there's this digital chandelier.

343
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,480
I'm worried I'm going to miss out on information.

344
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,960
And those are creators who have worked with us in the past.

345
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,140
Have developed content for us.

346
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,440
Will this be on the quiz teacher?

347
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,480
To make it better.

348
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,100
By the way, this is capture the flag.

349
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,460
For those who don't know.

350
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,740
This is not an extraction shooter.

351
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,480
I was like, oh, it looks like an extraction shooter.

352
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,540
But it's actually capture the flag.

353
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,700
I'm part of the group project.

354
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,140
Really?

355
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,140
We're all assigned in the teams.

356
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:30,720
I.e.

357
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,420
group projects.

358
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,520
And we're supposed to talk to each other too.

359
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,760
In the teams.

360
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,280
I thought it was like, you know.

361
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,700
You know, like randoms and stuff.

362
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,820
Like, you know, in other playtests.

363
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,460
You play with other randoms.

364
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,620
But you don't really talk to them.

365
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,200
But we're supposed to divide each other.

366
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,480
Into groups.

367
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:47,680
And then...

368
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,400
And also just really created cool...

369
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,020
And then like play with the team.

370
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,320
And play against each other.

371
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,140
And then we're flunking.

372
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:55,820
We are so...

373
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,700
I'm so sorry.

374
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,380
I hope there's like the two other...

375
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,680
By the way, teams of three.

376
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,700
I really hope the other team...

377
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,820
My other team members is going to carry me.

378
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,820
Because I have no idea what the fuck is going on.

379
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,260
So we got stuff like this.

380
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,800
I get this question a lot.

381
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,220
There's a...

382
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,580
I don't even know.

383
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,640
What kind of questions are you asking?

384
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:15,980
People have been asking me.

385
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:16,560
Is this live?

386
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,540
It's not.

387
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,800
It would be really cool if it was.

388
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,100
Apparently I'm patching 33 guild fights.

389
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,160
But we're at 33 now.

390
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,560
I haven't really asked about what this TV is going to do in the future.

391
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,140
But somebody suggested, hey, can I just stream in here?

392
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:28,940
And I was like, why not?

393
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:34,880
And then somebody said, well, what if it automatically like pulls somebody who's just trolling and puts like...

394
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,140
That's me.

395
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,060
Bad things on their stream and says...

396
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:37,580
That's not me.

397
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:38,560
That's not me.

398
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:40,940
But no.

399
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,220
More stuff like this.

400
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:48,580
This weekend, we do have a brand new version of this to bring players in.

401
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,080
And our community is going to test for us.

402
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:51,780
Because that's not me.

403
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,100
He meant really bad things.

404
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,940
Not the bad things.

405
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,960
And right above the dance floor, we have a very special room.

406
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,600
And I can't say anything.

407
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,420
We haven't announced it yet.

408
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,540
But we have a very special room.

409
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,640
It's going to come up right over here.

410
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,060
And we just looked at it today and it looks sick.

411
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,860
Here we're dancing.

412
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,320
It's even further up above.

413
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,480
But that's where it goes.

414
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,920
Also, this snail hologram has boobs.

415
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,520
I don't know if anyone's interested in looking.

416
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,160
Oh, I turned nudity off, guys.

417
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,300
There's apparently...

418
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,860
Now I know why.

419
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,000
I see.

420
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,720
There's a nudity function in the game.

421
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,160
And I was like, why is there a nudity function?

422
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,040
Let me turn that off.

423
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:33,820
That's crazy.

424
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,280
Snitties?

425
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,780
Snitties is crazy.

426
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:37,840
Like the sensor.

427
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,980
I turned it off.

428
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,700
I turned it off, the sensor.

429
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:40,840
Snitties is wild, bro.

430
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:40,960
That's crazy.

431
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,660
So, like, I don't know what it's going to be, but...

432
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,040
No, that's actually not...

433
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,520
I know.

434
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:47,860
We'll see.

435
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,620
There was talks about putting a sneener on it, but I think...

436
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,200
What?

437
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:51,720
Wow.

438
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:52,880
Okay.

439
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,720
See, here it is.

440
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:54,620
Show nudity.

441
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,960
You know, being inclusive, I support it.

442
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:57,320
Sneetie.

443
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,660
He's in sneener.

444
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:58,980
Oh.

445
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,660
Why am I lagging?

446
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,060
Be careful.

447
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,500
Whoa.

448
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,340
Why am I lagging?

449
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,720
There is a nudity option, actually, in the game.

450
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:05,900
What?

451
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:06,520
Oh, yeah.

452
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,120
I was like, what happened?

453
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:08,580
What happened?

454
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,520
If you watch it...

455
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:09,820
What happened?

456
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,440
You can.

457
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:10,820
Just watch it.

458
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,600
Let's go straight to the...

459
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,260
Because I showed the options?

460
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:13,920
Okay.

461
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:14,580
Let's go in.

462
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,440
Maybe I can go in now.

463
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,580
Turn off the camera customization, and from there, you'll be able to...

464
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,940
I'll turn the discreet a little bit quiet.

465
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,520
You guys don't need to listen to this.

466
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:26,740
If you only knew the power of the Biocore, he'd be on our...

467
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:27,900
Is this tutorial?

468
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,860
Oh, there's me.

469
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,240
Oh, this is, like, retro.

470
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,660
If you only knew the power of the...

471
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,220
Now, remember the plan.

472
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,400
Oh my god.

473
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:39,680
Oh my god.

474
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,840
I look like Sylvester Stallone right now.

475
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,020
Except with 80's hair.

476
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,560
Body scar?

477
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,000
That's right.

478
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,120
That's me!

479
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,000
No, it's not Doki Bird.

480
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,280
It says show nudity.

481
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,240
Wait.

482
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:02,960
Oh god.

483
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:04,880
Wait.

484
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:08,900
Wait.

485
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,080
I'm not... I don't want to... I'm worried.

486
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:17,780
I'm...

487
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,360
Wait, if I...

488
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,480
Oh thank god.

489
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:21,940
Okay.

490
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,820
Wait, wait.

491
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,200
Can I technically take it off?

492
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:29,580
Like...

493
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,380
I don't... where does the... cause it says show nudity.

494
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,200
Like where... where does it show?

495
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,480
Like where does it...

496
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,060
Maybe it's the boobs.

497
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,600
Maybe...

498
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,180
Maybe it's like...

499
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,740
Maybe it's the... for the girl.

500
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,060
Okay, we're definitely not going to do it for...

501
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,420
I... I was curious.

502
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,160
I was curious.

503
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:51,720
Okay.

504
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:56,800
Like... I was like wondering where that part... where the nudity part shows.

505
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,100
So I... I was curious.

506
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,040
But now I'm like no, that's a bad idea.

507
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,220
That's actually...

508
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,360
I stopped myself before it's too late.

509
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,140
I realized it was a very bad idea, guys.

510
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:07,960
I...

511
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:12,280
I realized it was a very bad idea.

512
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,620
Okay, let's see.

513
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,920
I turned down the Discord cause you guys don't have to hear.

514
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:23,720
Actually...

515
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:26,340
Okay.

516
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,700
Did he just fucking say 55 runs?

517
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,460
This is my first game.

518
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,400
And we also have minigames.

519
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:38,620
There's minigames?

520
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:39,520
Um...

521
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:39,860
Wait.

522
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:40,860
We did a test to see how much...

523
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:41,560
Oh...

524
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,080
We did a test to see how much...

525
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,320
Oh...

526
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:43,340
We did a test to see how much...

527
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,260
would handle performance-wise.

528
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:45,960
And it was okay.

529
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:46,980
It could be better, but...

530
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,900
Okay, nice.

531
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,320
I gotta show the abs.

532
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,960
If not Doki Bird worked out so hard, I gotta show the assets.

533
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,000
Right now, it's set to 21.

534
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,500
Yeah, that seems right.

535
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,180
But we can do any number that we want to.

536
00:19:59,260 --> 00:19:59,500
I think...

537
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,840
Oh, I have a flat ass.

538
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,360
This sucks.

539
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:01,620
This sucks.

540
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,060
Wait, none?

541
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,280
Just some more optimization.

542
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,900
Dude, why was there...

543
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,960
Definitely CPS.

544
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,240
Okay.

545
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,260
I gotta show...

546
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,460
I gotta show...

547
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,120
I got it.

548
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:15,540
If this...

549
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:18,860
If this showed more ass, I would pick this, because it hugs the body.

550
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,240
But, like, it doesn't matter.

551
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,340
It doesn't...

552
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,260
It doesn't matter.

553
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:28,960
Ooh.

554
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,200
Okay.

555
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:30,860
This way.

556
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,120
Alright.

557
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,720
Grab your gear, folks.

558
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,280
I know what you are.

559
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,900
Let's hit the battlefield and make this place totally ours.

560
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,320
Stoked to get started.

561
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,600
Yes.

562
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,440
Look at...

563
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,460
Do you have a good...

564
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,360
This is...

565
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:46,720
Yes.

566
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,100
This way.

567
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,600
Let's keep walking this shit, dude.

568
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:51,820
Okay.

569
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:52,940
We did it.

570
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:58,180
I think he perfectly reflects voice number three.

571
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,100
I think...

572
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,700
I think he definitely...

573
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:00,980
I think...

574
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,800
Let's go, bro!

575
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:05,700
Let's go!

576
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:06,900
Okay.

577
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,660
Makeup and face paint?

578
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,300
Oh, shit.

579
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:14,580
Alright.

580
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,560
You don't see the eyes though.

581
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,300
Let's see.

582
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,320
No, no tattoo.

583
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,460
Alright.

584
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:21,800
We are good.

585
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,080
Let's go.

586
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,380
Finish.

587
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,440
I'm pretty sure Dokie is going through the tutorial.

588
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,680
Is everybody still going through the tutorial?

589
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,100
I got called out.

590
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,860
I don't know if you guys heard that.

591
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,780
I don't know if you guys heard that.

592
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,540
Yeah, that's me.

593
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,840
No, you're not supposed...

594
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:52,960
What?

595
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,140
Was it an error message?

596
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,900
Was it an error message?

597
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,880
Yeah, we're going through tutorial, guys!

598
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,880
We're going through tutorial!

599
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,380
Guys, I'm gonna turn down the Discord.

600
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,340
I don't want you guys...

601
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,860
to hear them call me out even more.

602
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,360
I'm gonna mute the Discord.

603
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,020
Look, I already got called out!

604
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,200
Oh, nice!

605
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,780
I've just been using the cafeteria.

606
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:08,020
Now, there are other shades with other less good-looking fucking douchebags living in there.

607
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,820
It's okay, they're still doing the Q&A!

608
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,520
Okay, I'll turn up the game audio.

609
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,800
...competing over them to stay alive.

610
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:26,080
So, before you were frozen, you may have been a dental hygienist, or an accountant, or a vegetarian, but now you're a fighter.

611
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,880
Because that's what we need.

612
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:35,080
So get used to running, shooting, and getting shot in the face, because that's what you're gonna be doing for the majority of your time.

613
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,020
I recommend you get shot with...

614
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,940
Sorry, I'm listening.

615
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,560
Hopefully, this has helped.

616
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,640
If not, I don't care.

617
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:48,300
Guys, maybe I should skip the tutorial, guys!

618
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,980
Maybe I should

619
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,620
skip the tutorial!

620
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,100
...

621
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,120
Alright, we're gonna speedrun!

622
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,400
We're gonna speedrun this!

623
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,360
We're gonna speedrun!

624
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,560
I raised up the volume!

625
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,560
I hope it's okay!

626
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,820
No, I won't say they're waiting on me!

627
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,980
But, like, I'm speedrunning!

628
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:16,940
No!

629
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:17,640
...

630
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,820
Alright, let's go, let's go, let's go!

631
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,400
...

632
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,500
...

633
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:34,210
Why isn't it going faster?!

634
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:36,570
I'm literally waiting at an elevator!

635
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:38,130
Oh my god!

636
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,430
This is elevator simulator!

637
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:40,650
I don't understand!

638
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,950
Please, I need...

639
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:43,930
...

640
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:48,410
...

641
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:49,890
...

642
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:50,070
...

643
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:53,730
I'm trying!

644
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:55,970
I'm in a fucking cutscene!

645
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:58,090
Okay, where the fuck...

646
00:24:58,090 --> 00:24:59,050
Who do I talk to?

647
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:01,250
Okay...

648
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:03,730
Yeah, that's me!

649
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,330
Yeah, let's go!

650
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:07,570
Mission complete!

651
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,070
Wait, is...

652
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:10,910
Are these real people?

653
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:12,830
Did I do it?

654
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:15,670
Oh, now I do the tutorial!

655
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:16,730
What if I just don't?

656
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:17,410
...

657
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:23,230
Guys, we'll figure out the lore at another time!

658
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,390
Okay, now we're in the tutorial!

659
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:27,470
Now!

660
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:28,130
...

661
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:32,360
...

662
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,840
I thought we were!

663
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,600
Apparently this is a tutorial!

664
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:39,600
...

665
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,820
This is what all the fuss is over.

666
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:42,540
The goal?

667
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,200
Find and secure as many Biocores as you can.

668
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,460
There are three of them out there creatively named Biocore A, B, and C.

669
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:53,020
Whichever team gets the most, wins.

670
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:58,700
You'll always find them somewhere in the center of the map, but the locations change every match.

671
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,500
Nothing you can't handle.

672
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,200
Probably.

673
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,320
Okay.

674
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,500
You can start each match in your base vehicle.

675
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,640
Bring any Biocores.

676
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,320
I can do that.

677
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,200
Alright, here we go.

678
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:13,680
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

679
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,600
Oh wait, do I have to kill these?

680
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,840
Okay, these don't matter.

681
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,160
Go, go, go, go, go!

682
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,360
The dead yard is a barren area, separating the shade from the... Go, go, go, go!

683
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,040
We're going so fast!

684
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:31,140
We have to do our homework five minutes before classes start!

685
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,240
Let's head upstairs and activate the Biocore scanner and find out where they are.

686
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:37,740
Okay.

687
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:38,820
Activate system.

688
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,760
The Biocore scanner will show you where the Biocore is known by...

689
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:41,880
Okay.

690
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:42,800
This is scanner!

691
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,820
If you get killed, you can respawn.

692
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:46,240
Okay!

693
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,380
We have three lives!

694
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:47,940
Okay!

695
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,060
Gotcha!

696
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:56,160
When you're out there for reals, fighting for a Biocore with your standard issued peashooter could be an uphill battle.

697
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,040
So let's get you some better gear.

698
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,940
But in order to buy anything, first you need to get some power.

699
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:02,660
Okay.

700
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,500
So let's get murdering.

701
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,380
Get the Biocore!

702
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,100
Alright.

703
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:09,960
Take the loot!

704
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,680
You can't get gear without power.

705
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,720
And you can't get power without... Okay.

706
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,700
Oh my god, why is it taking so long to kill these guys?

707
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:22,780
...practice looting by mercilessly killing these cardboard cutouts we've conveniently left free.

708
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,680
Alright, that should be enough power for a gun and a shield.

709
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,980
So now it's time to go shopping.

710
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,180
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

711
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,020
Okay, shopping time!

712
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,300
You can use the power to buy gear.

713
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,620
Any weapons you buy will stay with you for the rest to locate the shop.

714
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,260
Okay, shop.

715
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,300
Alright, buy!

716
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:40,920
Shield!

717
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,340
What did I buy?

718
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,060
Oh my god!

719
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,180
...

720
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,500
I was like, what the fuck did I buy?

721
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:48,720
Okay, it's okay.

722
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,360
We got a gun.

723
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,140
I'm trying my best!

724
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:51,920
...

725
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,840
I'm speedrunning so hard!

726
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:57,700
...

727
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,020
Hey!

728
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,300
Okay, Biocores are usually fine to take the biocore.

729
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:06,400
First you need to interact.

730
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,480
First you stabilize this.

731
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,080
Okay, interact!

732
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,680
Okay, there you go.

733
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,520
Okay, we gotta lower the...

734
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,220
That's okay.

735
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,620
I can lower the sound effect while I do this.

736
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,280
Okay, there you go.

737
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:20,500
...

738
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,600
I have waiting time.

739
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,520
...

740
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,140
I'm trying my best!

741
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:31,900
Boom!

742
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,000
Alright.

743
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,740
Okay, I have special abilities!

744
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,360
Use a biocore!

745
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,520
Alright, watch this!

746
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:41,860
Speedrun!

747
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,180
Okay, sorry, that...

748
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,380
Now!

749
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,680
Speedrun starts now!

750
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:49,200
...

751
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:51,920
Wait!

752
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:54,060
Wait fast!

753
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:54,640
...

754
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,560
...

755
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:58,800
...

756
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,800
...

757
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,420
...

758
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,000
...

759
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,020
...

760
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,200
...

761
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:10,220
...

762
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,720
...

763
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,160
I am pinging!

764
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,240
Please!

765
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,380
This is a speedrun!

766
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:19,820
...

767
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,700
Oh my god!

768
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,800
I need to be taught how to revive!

769
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,200
Oh my god, look at me!

770
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:27,580
...

771
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,120
...

772
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,000
...

773
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,480
Alright.

774
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,620
Get the biocore.

775
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,320
I'm running!

776
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,080
I'm running as fast as I can!

777
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:40,880
Oh, I can slide!

778
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,860
Oh my god, what the fuck is going on in my name?

779
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,760
Okay, there you go.

780
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,960
Alright, as you cross, the biocore will alert them to your position.

781
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:48,520
Oh yeah?

782
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,620
Watch this.

783
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,540
Okay, give me a sec.

784
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,920
Sorry, I'm a little nervous.

785
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,000
...

786
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,200
...

787
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:57,840
...

788
00:29:59,360 --> 00:29:59,760
No!

789
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,860
Okay, there you go, go, go, go.

790
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,000
We don't need to learn how...

791
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,840
They were telling me to ping, and I was like no.

792
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:09,140
...

793
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,880
To secure the put in the machine.

794
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,780
They're like, Doki ping!

795
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:16,840
Ping Doki!

796
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:17,400
And I'm like, no!

797
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,620
My teammates don't need to know what's happening!

798
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:20,420
...

799
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,000
...

800
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,240
Oh, I have to defend!

801
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:25,740
Okay.

802
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:26,760
That's fine.

803
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,100
...

804
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:30,620
...

805
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,280
Get too close?

806
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:33,640
Okay.

807
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:35,920
Wait.

808
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,140
They're not even gonna move closer to me.

809
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,020
Where's the wrist?

810
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,880
Oh my god, this gun is weak as hell.

811
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,300
Holy shit.

812
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,960
Okay, I should have kept the shotgun.

813
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,000
... Nice.

814
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:48,700
We did it.

815
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,000
That was so easy.

816
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:57,060
Yeah, why would the enemies need to know where they are?

817
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,040
They're gonna be dead anyway.

818
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:58,820
...

819
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:03,400
My team doesn't need to know where they are.

820
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,340
One of the devs was like, please ping.

821
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:07,660
...

822
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:08,620
...

823
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,240
...

824
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:11,840
...

825
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,500
They're like, Doki ping, please.

826
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,520
...

827
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,880
...

828
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,500
We did it!

829
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:21,840
...

830
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,660
...

831
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,340
...

832
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,940
...

833
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:27,540
...

834
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,080
...

835
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,130
...

836
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:32,270
...

837
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:34,650
I don't trust where it comes from, I really want to play it off.

838
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:35,050
...

839
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:35,830
...

840
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:37,370
...

841
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:44,330
That was a good gel for you two there.

842
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:44,710
...

843
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:45,550
...

844
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:49,250
Oh, can you?

845
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:50,210
That's pretty dope.

846
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:51,630
Okay, I mean it.

847
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:52,250
...

848
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:53,190
...

849
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:57,550
Oh, I'm...

850
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:57,770
...

851
00:31:57,770 --> 00:31:58,390
It's not just me!

852
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,690
Somebody's having issues!

853
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:01,610
I'm not last!

854
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,890
Oh my god, it's not just me!

855
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:07,950
Let's fucking go!

856
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:10,390
Alright, now I'll listen to you.

857
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:10,890
Let's go!

858
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,810
I'm gonna switch my shirt out real quick and I'll be right back.

859
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:16,050
Not last!

860
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:20,830
I didn't even do my homework and at least I showed up!

861
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:21,670
Hex Blaster.

862
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:23,350
Alright, I'm gonna switch to the Hex Blaster.

863
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:25,410
It's up to you.

864
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,030
And now you're done with the...

865
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,950
Don't forget about the gear.

866
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:32,970
When you get there, I want you to locate a shop and buy yourself a shield.

867
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,530
3 minutes or 1 minute?

868
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:35,110
3 minutes.

869
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:38,450
What do you mean step 2 out of 8?!

870
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:40,830
There was more?!

871
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:47,410
Step 2?!

872
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:52,150
Alright, so Doki's done.

873
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:52,830
I'm done!

874
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:55,950
He said I'm done!

875
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:57,770
So like right now, as I speak.

876
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:00,090
No way.

877
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:01,330
Press play.

878
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,250
It shouldn't take this long.

879
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:06,510
It should be literally less than 10 seconds.

880
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,230
Alright, I'm gonna get the shotgun.

881
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:10,270
I feel like...

882
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:11,350
What about the sniper?

883
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:12,430
I wanna try the sniper.

884
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:13,910
Is this test?

885
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:16,190
Alright, I'm in the test now.

886
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:19,130
No Doki!

887
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:19,710
No Doki!

888
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:20,330
Don't kill him!

889
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:21,370
No Doki!

890
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:22,890
No Doki!

891
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:23,230
Cancel Q!

892
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:23,630
Cancel Q!

893
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:24,050
Cancel!

894
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:24,410
Okay!

895
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:27,430
Damn it.

896
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:28,030
He got me.

897
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:29,870
I canceled.

898
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:31,230
I did it.

899
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:34,170
Alright, let's see.

900
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,070
I need to lower my sense.

901
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:35,930
It's way too high.

902
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:38,130
Alright, so let me at least get this game ready.

903
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:43,890
Graham, if it's not giving you any luck here, we can have somebody trying to help you out with...

904
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,830
I'm like bringing...

905
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:47,370
I'm like the...

906
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:49,510
There's a group of friends.

907
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:54,390
And then one of the friends was like, Hey, can my little sister come and join us?

908
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:55,390
No, no.

909
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:56,130
It's entirely up to you.

910
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:58,990
The reason why I ask is because it might require a PC restart.

911
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:00,830
That's me.

912
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:02,730
Yeah, yeah.

913
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:03,570
Just give it a quick restart.

914
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:05,230
And I'm gonna get people into it when you come back.

915
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,810
Hopefully, you should be able to get in the game.

916
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,190
Try that out.

917
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:10,570
And then when you come back, I'll let you know when you're on.

918
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:10,710
That's me.

919
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,510
If not, we'll have somebody help out.

920
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:12,690
Okay?

921
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:13,930
Thank you.

922
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:15,190
Yeah, for sure.

923
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:16,550
Alrighty, so...

924
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:20,310
What we're gonna do now is finally hopefully play the game.

925
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:23,570
So, I'm gonna announce teams who are gonna be competing with each other.

926
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:29,790
And all you have to do to accept the team invite is press Y on your keyboard.

927
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:30,430
Okay.

928
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:33,350
And if you're Latino like me, you press E.

929
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:34,610
What?

930
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,410
You guys have different keyboards?

931
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:36,970
So...

932
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:41,990
Team 1 is gonna be myself, Doki, and Iko.

933
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:44,650
So, I'm gonna send y'all guys some invites here.

934
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:46,530
And then Team 2 is gonna be...

935
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:48,150
Iceman.

936
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:49,690
Five stars.

937
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:51,270
Is it stars?

938
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:52,030
Yeah.

939
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:52,990
Okay.

940
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:53,410
Five stars.

941
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:55,710
Iceman, invite five stars and Kubaki.

942
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:56,890
Mm-hmm.

943
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:59,990
Winton, invite Catboy and Dasbear.

944
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:02,770
Froggy, invite Calus.

945
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:04,110
Oh, I just pronounced E.

946
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:05,890
Oh, I thought you guys just had different keyboards.

947
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:10,670
But if you can't get Grim in, we might have to put Kusai in there for you until...

948
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:11,410
For the time being.

949
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:14,270
All right.

950
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:14,590
So...

951
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:14,790
Whee!

952
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:16,150
I just did an invite to Iko.

953
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:16,330
My bad.

954
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:16,510
Guys, we're gonna be inviting Grim.

955
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:17,130
We're so fucked.

956
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:21,190
Wait.

957
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:24,730
We're not ready.

958
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:29,070
Is there gonna be like a stream mode for the music?

959
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,430
We're not gonna be pinging anything.

960
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:31,650
There is a stream mode right now.

961
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,050
Wow!

962
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:33,670
Wait, can I get back up?

963
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:33,950
All right.

964
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:37,230
I'm watching Doki's chat tell her the best why.

965
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:37,870
Oh!

966
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:40,750
It's giving me so much energy right now.

967
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:44,130
I thought you guys were teaching me how to say...

968
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:46,490
I thought you guys were just teaching me how to say, like, let's go.

969
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:49,730
Why in Spanish?

970
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:52,990
So, I'm just gonna wait for Grim to come in real quick.

971
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:57,290
I thought you guys were teaching me how to say why in Spanish.

972
00:35:57,370 --> 00:36:00,710
But once we get the combinations in, we're gonna all press Y to queue up.

973
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:03,070
And I'll give the announcement for that.

974
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:07,590
All righty.

975
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:07,890
I'm back.

976
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:11,720
It's okay.

977
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,780
We're okay, guys.

978
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,680
Hey, if I'm ready up, it's fine.

979
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,620
Actually, I also just noticed...

980
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,220
Because I need to wait for two other people.

981
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:17,680
Okay.

982
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:17,720
I'm back.

983
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,300
I'm back.

984
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:19,800
Deep voice guy.

985
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:20,700
So, it doesn't matter.

986
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,000
Because you guys are teaching me how to say Y.

987
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,600
I'm a resident announcer.

988
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:25,880
There we go.

989
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,200
And why?

990
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,980
I was like, wait, are these real people?

991
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:28,920
No, they're not.

992
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,460
So, who was the last team?

993
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:33,620
If Grim can't get in, just invite Metzu.

994
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:34,640
Froggy.

995
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,200
Yeah!

996
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,300
Not last!

997
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,780
I showed up, even though I didn't do my homework.

998
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,100
I showed up.

999
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,080
Guys, they're play testing for people like me.

1000
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:45,500
They're playing testing for people like you.

1001
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:45,780
I'm just kidding.

1002
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,240
I'm just kidding.

1003
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:47,780
I'm just kidding.

1004
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,340
I am the regular player.

1005
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:53,760
If they Doki proof this, this game will be solid.

1006
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,340
Not right.

1007
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,920
You gotta lock in.

1008
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,980
Guys, I have a sniper.

1009
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,860
I'm so locked in.

1010
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,460
I don't know how good people are at FPS games in this lobby.

1011
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,180
So, like...

1012
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,920
Why do you want me to look at your ass so badly?

1013
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,820
I might be fucked.

1014
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:13,920
Hold still.

1015
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:14,460
Nice test.

1016
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,240
Dude, you're so oily, bro.

1017
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,740
What the fuck is...

1018
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,520
What is with your pants, dude?

1019
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,780
It looks like there's a hole in it.

1020
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:22,360
This is a test.

1021
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:22,400
This is a test.

1022
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:25,800
Dude, did you put a hole on your b-hole, dude?

1023
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:26,820
What?

1024
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:30,660
You put a black little dot on his b-hole on his underwear.

1025
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:36,000
Bro, this is one of the developers, guys.

1026
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,040
Yeah, you can ready up right now.

1027
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:42,620
Your team lead will queue the search for the match once we're all ready.

1028
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,780
All right, sounds good.

1029
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,380
What's going on?

1030
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,500
I'm doing the best I can.

1031
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,100
Yeah.

1032
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,080
My best.

1033
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,780
That's what's going on.

1034
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,360
We're just waiting.

1035
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,780
We're waiting for some guy that didn't show up.

1036
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:12,140
And that's why we haven't started the game in 38 minutes.

1037
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,740
Because of that one guy.

1038
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,040
What I just said y'all did not hear, right?

1039
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:21,680
In Discord?

1040
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,280
Nope, didn't hear anything.

1041
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:23,860
Sweet!

1042
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:31,180
Yeah, that one guy that we're waiting for right now.

1043
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,280
I didn't say anything amazing.

1044
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,280
I just wanted to see if y'all could hear me.

1045
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,520
Uh, Grim, what's up?

1046
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,120
Hey, what's up?

1047
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:39,540
I'm back.

1048
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:40,940
Alright, awesome.

1049
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,980
I don't even know.

1050
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,520
I think he never showed up.

1051
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,460
Yeah.

1052
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,800
Can't believe it.

1053
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:50,120
We couldn't start the lobby because of him.

1054
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,580
Not because of me.

1055
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:56,540
You don't like chicken.

1056
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:02,540
Nah, just any type of chicken.

1057
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,280
It's okay not to like chicken.

1058
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,620
I don't already do any.

1059
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,000
Where's my melee?

1060
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,500
He needed to save you.

1061
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:13,340
Yeah.

1062
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,560
I remember back in the day I used to get excited.

1063
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,380
I think you're nice.

1064
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:20,440
Guys, I can't be like...

1065
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,620
Guys, I can't be illiterate.

1066
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:24,800
If I was illiterate, why do I have glasses?

1067
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:33,360
If I was illiterate, how could I have glasses on?

1068
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,320
I feel like it just sits in the skin.

1069
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,580
And the meat is always just whack.

1070
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:38,180
Exactly.

1071
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,460
I can't be illiterate.

1072
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,540
Yeah, but that's like all of them.

1073
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,440
Oh yeah, did I bring down... I already brought down the sound effects.

1074
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:47,240
Is Discord okay too?

1075
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:49,700
Shut up, Echo.

1076
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,020
Who asked?

1077
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,060
Oh my god.

1078
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,200
Oh my god, you guys are all so mean to me.

1079
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,640
Oh my god.

1080
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,380
We are back.

1081
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:00,400
It's like the pineapple.

1082
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,360
We're still waiting.

1083
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:07,540
Alright, so because I did not account for Metsu rizzing me up, I have to put him on a team here.

1084
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:08,080
So...

1085
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,280
Wynton, can you actually...

1086
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:12,460
Catboy actually...

1087
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,180
How did he get that?

1088
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,300
Sorry man, I'm kicking you out.

1089
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:14,820
Oh!

1090
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,040
Wait, which sniper did I get?

1091
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,580
Is it a battle rifle?

1092
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:21,260
Oh, there it is.

1093
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,000
Look at the Rizzlord.

1094
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,400
Which one did I get?

1095
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,280
I assume these are all... this is default.

1096
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,960
Do what you can do here.

1097
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,080
Okay.

1098
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,100
Did I say Metsu?

1099
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,440
No, this is way too slow.

1100
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,520
I'm borderline dyslexic.

1101
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,740
This is way... the sentence is way too slow.

1102
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:40,680
Okay, here we go.

1103
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,680
Oh shit.

1104
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,920
You mean to tell me you got that dyslexic Rizz?

1105
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:48,420
Oh, hey.

1106
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,440
I need to make sure the...

1107
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,140
Bro...

1108
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,180
I need to make sure...

1109
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,780
You don't know what it is, do you?

1110
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:55,960
No, not yet.

1111
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:57,320
I'm suffering over here.

1112
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:57,740
Okay.

1113
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:03,260
Alright, so for the sake of getting through this man, I don't want to waste your time on it.

1114
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,240
Let's get somebody to help you out.

1115
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:09,000
So, in this case, we're going to swap you out.

1116
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:09,540
No.

1117
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,180
And I don't know who you're supposed to be with again, my bad.

1118
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:12,440
Okay.

1119
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,220
Yeah, yeah, Kuzai.

1120
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,720
Yeah, yeah, just in fact, Kuzai.

1121
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:15,660
And we're gonna get started...

1122
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:15,920
Okay.

1123
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,520
I'm just making sure I understand the sniper.

1124
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,160
So, let me just be like, everybody can now start reining up.

1125
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:19,740
So, everybody can be like, everybody can now start reining up.

1126
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:20,140
Press free to draw.

1127
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,280
And then we're gonna start searching for the match.

1128
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,480
As far as...

1129
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,780
Who's gonna be helping you, let me see here.

1130
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,080
Oh, we're in!

1131
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:30,740
Oh, searching.

1132
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,280
Guys, we went straight into...

1133
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,720
I was gonna give you guys life updates, but like, we went straight into this.

1134
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,440
We went straight into this.

1135
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,460
I was right into this.

1136
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,700
We had no intro, we were just doing it live.

1137
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,680
See why not?

1138
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,640
There we go.

1139
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,540
Oh, match found!

1140
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:54,340
Alright, so.

1141
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:54,760
Okay.

1142
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:06,580
What's gonna happen is, whenever you load into the game after the little animation you have with the cool car driving everywhere, you're gonna see on the bottom left corner of your monitor what team you are on.

1143
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,720
It's gonna say team 1, 2, 3, or 4.

1144
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:13,820
You're gonna join the Discord BC right below us here in this server.

1145
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:16,020
Just join the matching team that you have.

1146
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:18,320
Doki, you do not do that.

1147
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,720
We stay up here.

1148
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,340
I work here.

1149
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,040
I refuse to move.

1150
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:21,820
Yay!

1151
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:26,300
I have HeadDev!

1152
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:27,380
Wait!

1153
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,340
We can't lose!

1154
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:30,940
He can literally cheat!

1155
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:31,660
Guys!

1156
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:37,980
My Dev can literally put in a cheat code and make sure I don't lose.

1157
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,780
Is it just Ascendant?

1158
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:42,140
Yes, Ascendant.com.

1159
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:42,980
Okay.

1160
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:45,580
I get HeadDev!

1161
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,260
Okay, I see.

1162
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,300
The Dev's my favorite!

1163
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,560
I'm the little sister!

1164
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,960
Special treatment!

1165
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:56,740
Let's go!

1166
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,480
Slash... Slash God mode.

1167
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,260
Catboy.

1168
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,680
Okay, what do I have?

1169
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:07,780
I have Seer.

1170
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,280
I have a little bit of Troubleshooting.

1171
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,320
What do I have?

1172
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:11,280
I only have one thing.

1173
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:12,080
I'm broke.

1174
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:13,460
I have Finite.

1175
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,940
I can try, but...

1176
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:15,240
Okay.

1177
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,120
Perks are passive.

1178
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,220
I have none.

1179
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:19,800
I don't have any problems with the game.

1180
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,160
But Grim likes stuff nice.

1181
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:28,920
Grim, my recommendation is to try and change your graphic settings in the game.

1182
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:29,980
Let's go!

1183
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:31,840
Okay.

1184
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:35,920
Try that out and see if it gets you in.

1185
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:37,500
Alright.

1186
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,480
What's happening?

1187
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,980
Why is this gun so fucking weak?

1188
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:46,480
Holy shit!

1189
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,480
Holy shit!

1190
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,500
That gun is so weak!

1191
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:53,580
Oh my god!

1192
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:54,600
I have a sniper!

1193
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,320
Where's my cheat code to make you buff my sniper?

1194
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:02,720
Okey dokey!

1195
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:04,140
You there?

1196
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:05,520
Yo!

1197
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,200
Are we gaming?

1198
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:09,080
Am I talking in game?

1199
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:11,580
Wait!

1200
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:13,460
My in-game voice chat doesn't work!

1201
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:14,640
No!

1202
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:15,680
Okay.

1203
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,260
Give me a sec.

1204
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,380
Let's go to Doki real quick.

1205
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,000
No!

1206
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:20,900
Okay.

1207
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:21,340
Wait.

1208
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:22,480
Okay.

1209
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:22,880
Now...

1210
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:23,160
Don't hit that tree.

1211
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:23,680
Wait.

1212
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,000
Let me...

1213
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,180
I need to push the talk, guys.

1214
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:25,900
I need...

1215
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,380
Give me a sec.

1216
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,780
I need to push the talk on Discord.

1217
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,840
Why are you inside, Doki?

1218
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:35,220
Hello?

1219
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:35,500
Hello?

1220
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:36,780
Don't say that.

1221
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:37,140
Hello?

1222
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:37,900
Don't say that.

1223
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,920
I hope that God heard chat and I knew that.

1224
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:40,720
That was fucking awful.

1225
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,080
What do we...

1226
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:41,580
What do we do?

1227
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,720
Why is my sniper gun so bad?

1228
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,360
What do you mean it's so bad?

1229
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:48,800
Explain.

1230
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:49,500
Give me context.

1231
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,360
Why is the damage so weak?

1232
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:53,000
Can you buff the damage on the sniper gun?

1233
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:53,140
Okay.

1234
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:53,440
No, no, no.

1235
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:53,640
All right.

1236
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:54,440
No.

1237
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:54,920
Okay.

1238
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:55,540
So come here.

1239
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:55,900
Come here.

1240
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:56,200
All right.

1241
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,060
So we're gonna...

1242
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,360
We're gonna run into some smart stuff.

1243
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:58,800
All right.

1244
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,840
See this little gun in my hand?

1245
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:00,040
Yeah.

1246
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,080
A little pistol that I got?

1247
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,000
This is a...

1248
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,080
Get out of here, chat!

1249
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:03,940
Sorry.

1250
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:04,340
This is a...

1251
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:04,680
Oh.

1252
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:06,680
Press your three key.

1253
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:07,840
You're gonna get a pistol out.

1254
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:08,420
Yeah.

1255
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,320
And this is gonna have unlimited ammo.

1256
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:12,500
This is like your utility to kill everything that is not...

1257
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:12,680
Wait.

1258
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,560
Is this the strongest gun?

1259
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:14,580
No.

1260
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,040
Oh.

1261
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:17,400
It's just the strongest gun against...

1262
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:18,960
The mobs?

1263
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:19,940
Yeah.

1264
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:20,220
The mobs.

1265
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:20,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1266
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:20,840
Oh!

1267
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:21,260
Wait.

1268
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:22,540
I have limited ammo?

1269
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:23,660
Yeah.

1270
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:24,960
You have limited ammo with the pistol.

1271
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:25,520
But not your sniper.

1272
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:26,920
You don't have unlimited ammo with your sniper.

1273
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:27,560
Okay.

1274
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:29,380
All right.

1275
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:30,360
So, see that snail?

1276
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:30,940
Go murder it.

1277
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:31,420
Okay.

1278
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:33,260
Murder it faster.

1279
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:34,380
There you go.

1280
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:35,860
Nice.

1281
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:36,160
All right.

1282
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:39,320
So, whenever you kill these things, don't run over it yet.

1283
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:40,340
It's gonna drop stuff.

1284
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:40,720
All right?

1285
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:41,000
See?

1286
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:41,800
Heal stuff.

1287
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:42,700
Okay.

1288
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,520
We're gonna watch the snails drop stuff.

1289
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:47,300
All right.

1290
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:47,640
So...

1291
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:47,660
Oh, okay.

1292
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:49,840
Let me see here.

1293
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:50,740
Where's the snail?

1294
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:52,980
Fix your game, ascendant.

1295
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:53,640
Where's your snails at?

1296
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:53,820
Okay.

1297
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:54,320
Here's one right here.

1298
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:54,880
Let me kill it real quick.

1299
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:55,960
All right.

1300
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:56,620
So, you drop stuff.

1301
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:58,080
You see this little green thing right here?

1302
00:45:58,180 --> 00:45:58,240
Yeah.

1303
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:58,560
Over here.

1304
00:45:58,880 --> 00:45:59,440
That's the power.

1305
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,960
We need to get as much of that as we can for maybe two minutes while we're out here.

1306
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:03,140
Okay.

1307
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:03,320
Okay.

1308
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:04,580
All right.

1309
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:09,140
So, the more we have this, the more we'll be able to use it to buy gear and stuff.

1310
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:09,760
Oh, you can take that.

1311
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:10,480
You can take that right there.

1312
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:11,940
It's a purple shield that you can have.

1313
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:12,140
Oh, nice.

1314
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,020
All right.

1315
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:14,980
So, big.

1316
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:17,420
We've got 90, 50, 60, eco.

1317
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:18,280
What's the math?

1318
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:21,180
Hurry up, Jarvis.

1319
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:21,840
200.

1320
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:22,240
200.

1321
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:22,720
Thank you.

1322
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:23,140
All right.

1323
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,380
So, we have 200 power.

1324
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,780
We're gonna go all...

1325
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:25,940
We're gonna go...

1326
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:27,860
We're all gonna leave the scales alone now.

1327
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:28,280
Okay.

1328
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:32,100
And we're gonna go right over here to scan for the objective.

1329
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,640
This is the objective, but you need to scan for more objectives.

1330
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:36,100
Okay.

1331
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:36,660
It's confusing.

1332
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:37,060
I know.

1333
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:37,480
It's crazy.

1334
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:38,180
Where's the other teams?

1335
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,640
They're doing the same exact thing we are right now, which is...

1336
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,500
Oh, but they're on other sides of the maps, right?

1337
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:45,540
Exactly.

1338
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:46,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1339
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:49,280
So, this is our forward base.

1340
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,840
This is where we're gonna respawn when we die.

1341
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:51,080
Okay.

1342
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,660
So, you can respawn...

1343
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:53,240
We have to go to A.

1344
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:54,600
Yeah, yeah.

1345
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:55,040
We're gonna go to A.

1346
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:57,560
And then we found A again using A.

1347
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:58,060
Oh, A.

1348
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:58,920
What?

1349
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,440
That's what it is.

1350
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:02,780
Oh, dude, we got super lucky.

1351
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:03,780
It's like right in front of us.

1352
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:05,020
Yay!

1353
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:06,740
Yippee!

1354
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:07,940
All right.

1355
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:11,060
So, actually, we're gonna go over here really quick before we start counting down A.

1356
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:12,140
Because...

1357
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:13,480
We're gonna deposit all of our power.

1358
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:14,960
We're gonna upgrade our weapons.

1359
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:16,620
Yeah, we're gonna upgrade our weapons.

1360
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:17,920
We're gonna upgrade our shields.

1361
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:20,440
So, that purple shield you have, right?

1362
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:21,080
Yeah.

1363
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:21,820
Whenever you die...

1364
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:22,380
Wait, do I have fall damage?

1365
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:23,420
Nope.

1366
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:23,840
You can jump off of it.

1367
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:24,780
Oh, there's no fall damage?

1368
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:25,360
Fuck yeah.

1369
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:25,840
There's no fall damage.

1370
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:25,920
There's no fall damage.

1371
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:26,620
Sweet.

1372
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:27,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1373
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:28,000
So...

1374
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:29,180
Wait.

1375
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,080
It's a little ouchy.

1376
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:36,380
Where the fuck...

1377
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:37,080
Where are they?

1378
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:39,740
So, yeah.

1379
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:40,140
I believe you.

1380
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:41,740
Oh, my God.

1381
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:43,020
Oh, really?

1382
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:44,560
Can I have my hand, please?

1383
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:48,340
Yeah, see?

1384
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:49,860
The death advantage.

1385
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:50,800
I didn't shoot my gun.

1386
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,980
So, that purple shield that you have, if you die, you do not respawn with it.

1387
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:53,800
Whoa!

1388
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,660
Everything that you buy...

1389
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:55,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1390
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:55,900
...from...

1391
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:01,520
This beautiful big machine, that will, like, everything you buy here, you will respawn with.

1392
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:06,560
So, what we're gonna do, really quick, we're gonna spend some cash, but I need you to deposit your cash.

1393
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:07,320
Wait.

1394
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:07,820
Where do I deposit?

1395
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:08,860
How do I deposit?

1396
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:09,180
Right here.

1397
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:09,940
Right here.

1398
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:10,100
Right here.

1399
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:10,700
Is your balance?

1400
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:11,100
Yeah, yeah.

1401
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:11,680
Put it all in there.

1402
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:12,420
All right.

1403
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,760
So, it should say, like, 300, almost 400 for you right now.

1404
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,220
Now, you're gonna use that power to buy anything that you want here.

1405
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:22,520
So, I would recommend buying a blue shield, but picking up your purple shield when you drop it.

1406
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:23,960
Because if you die...

1407
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:25,160
Why would I...

1408
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:27,080
Because if you die, you don't keep the purple shield.

1409
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:27,340
Oh!

1410
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:27,960
Okay.

1411
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:29,040
Yeah.

1412
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:32,400
But since you bought this from the shop, you will respawn with it.

1413
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:32,780
There you go.

1414
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:33,140
All right.

1415
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:33,640
Now, pick it up.

1416
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:35,100
And then, I'll pick up the purple.

1417
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:35,460
Okay.

1418
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:36,300
Nice.

1419
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:36,780
Yeah.

1420
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:37,260
There we go.

1421
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:37,440
Okay.

1422
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,180
And then, one last thing.

1423
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:40,020
You're gonna buy this thing called a VTEC-6.

1424
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:41,000
The VTEC-6?

1425
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:42,420
Oh, behind...

1426
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:42,900
Whoa!

1427
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:44,920
There's a shield there.

1428
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:45,100
Oh, my God.

1429
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:45,860
Okay.

1430
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:46,740
That's fine.

1431
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:47,240
My bad.

1432
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:47,840
No, my bad.

1433
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:48,620
That's on me.

1434
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,660
I was yapping too long.

1435
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:53,120
Let me know... oh, they are pushing.

1436
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:55,320
Wait, wait.

1437
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:56,120
Do I have to get the hell out of here?

1438
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:57,180
No, no, no.

1439
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:57,720
I don't need to.

1440
00:48:59,240 --> 00:48:59,640
Okay.

1441
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:00,200
Maybe I do.

1442
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:02,500
Wait.

1443
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:03,140
What the fuck?

1444
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:05,640
Oh, they didn't reload!

1445
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,100
This gun isn't reloading!

1446
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:08,120
No!

1447
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,120
So, it looks like we...

1448
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:17,760
It's not that we are intentionally designed to share the shop, but because we spawn technically close together...

1449
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:17,980
Yeah.

1450
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:18,500
This is very...

1451
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,200
Again, this is how the shop works.

1452
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:20,900
Okay.

1453
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:23,500
So, they also needed the exact same things that we do.

1454
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:23,780
So...

1455
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:24,020
Okay.

1456
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:25,640
Let's just go to A.

1457
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:27,280
Looks like somebody is at A right now.

1458
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:27,740
Okay.

1459
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:28,020
Okay.

1460
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:30,400
I can't believe...

1461
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,000
If I...

1462
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,060
If my shotgun was reloaded, he would have been dead.

1463
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:34,100
I believe.

1464
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,000
Oh, what the fuck?

1465
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:37,260
Okay.

1466
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:38,140
There's two up here right now.

1467
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,340
I just keep dying.

1468
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:39,720
Just fall down.

1469
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:40,060
Fall down.

1470
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:40,260
Fall down.

1471
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:40,700
I'll get you.

1472
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:41,900
Okay.

1473
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:42,840
They're not...

1474
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:43,360
Oh, they're...

1475
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:44,060
Just give us a little bit of cover.

1476
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:45,060
I don't think they're gonna push.

1477
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:46,100
No, they're not.

1478
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:47,380
They're low.

1479
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:50,900
They're low.

1480
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:53,120
Oh, behind us!

1481
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,380
Something going on?

1482
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:54,980
I don't think they're gonna push.

1483
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:55,140
No, they're not.

1484
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:58,280
Oh!

1485
00:49:58,380 --> 00:49:58,740
Oh!

1486
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:01,520
I'm coming.

1487
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:01,820
I'm...

1488
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:02,420
Oh, no!

1489
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:02,980
I'm down.

1490
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:04,320
Oh, I think...

1491
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,020
I'm fucked, here.

1492
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:06,760
I guess.

1493
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:07,360
There's so many...

1494
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,340
There's so many people here.

1495
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:09,840
I'm healing ya.

1496
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,460
I would say let's just like hold back really quick.

1497
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:15,040
It might be smarter to let like these teams fight each other.

1498
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:15,860
Oh, yeah.

1499
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:19,700
I'm about to spawn in three seconds.

1500
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,880
And if they wanna take A, they can.

1501
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:24,720
But we can now scan for B.

1502
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:33,880
I hear them above me.

1503
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:34,780
Oh, they are right here.

1504
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:42,110
I thought I had a shotgun earlier.

1505
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:52,620
Oh, I knocked one.

1506
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:04,470
How do we heal?

1507
00:51:06,190 --> 00:51:06,990
Yeah, yeah, eco.

1508
00:51:07,390 --> 00:51:08,250
Show her the gloves.

1509
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:11,050
I need some energy ammo.

1510
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:12,430
Here, here.

1511
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:13,430
No, I don't have energy ammo.

1512
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:15,550
Doki, come over here real quick.

1513
00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:18,330
Shit, there is someone next to me.

1514
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:19,550
Oh, no, no, they are up here.

1515
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:21,430
They are trying to shoot us through the fucking window.

1516
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:22,550
Where are they?

1517
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:24,530
We are going to come right here actually.

1518
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:25,130
We are going to protect ourselves.

1519
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:26,470
Oh, he got me.

1520
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:27,710
Yeah, he did.

1521
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:29,610
Whoa, there is people behind me.

1522
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:31,270
Oh shit, there is people behind you.

1523
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:31,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1524
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:35,250
I'm like sort of safe.

1525
00:51:36,270 --> 00:51:36,730
Do it.

1526
00:51:36,810 --> 00:51:37,270
I don't know.

1527
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:38,110
I'm watching, I'm watching.

1528
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:42,330
Let's just fall back this way.

1529
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:43,830
Oh shit, there is somebody right here in front of us.

1530
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:45,290
Just run, just run, just run.

1531
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:48,710
Let's go into our base.

1532
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:49,290
Okay.

1533
00:51:49,350 --> 00:51:49,970
Let's get some safety.

1534
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:53,670
Oh, up top, up top, up top.

1535
00:51:54,870 --> 00:51:55,430
Up top?

1536
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:56,830
Oh.

1537
00:51:56,870 --> 00:51:57,290
How am I peeing?

1538
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:02,530
I am ass dude.

1539
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:03,370
Oh my god.

1540
00:52:04,110 --> 00:52:04,550
One down.

1541
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:06,550
Alright, you got energy right there by the way.

1542
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:08,810
Okay, alright.

1543
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:09,450
Stay right here Doki.

1544
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:10,930
Actually, press right here.

1545
00:52:11,290 --> 00:52:14,650
I want you to come in here and I want you to see if you can share some of your ammo.

1546
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:16,170
Oh.

1547
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:17,610
Share my ammo?

1548
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:18,730
How do I share it?

1549
00:52:18,930 --> 00:52:19,510
Yeah, press tab.

1550
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:20,270
Okay.

1551
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:24,230
And on the right side, you are going to see like a green circle of bullets on it.

1552
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:24,690
Oh.

1553
00:52:24,730 --> 00:52:26,150
Is it like full or anything?

1554
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:27,110
Does it have a number on top of it?

1555
00:52:27,370 --> 00:52:28,010
Do you want me to drop this?

1556
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:28,210
Thank you.

1557
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:29,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1558
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:30,530
Drop all of it.

1559
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:31,190
I did.

1560
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:31,450
I did.

1561
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:33,190
Okay, cool.

1562
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:35,550
So, now what Iko is going to do, she is going to use these healing gloves.

1563
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:37,610
Oh.

1564
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:40,650
Oh, I see.

1565
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:42,750
Alright, cool.

1566
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:47,530
Now, do you want to see how you can also heal by yourself if you don't have any type of heals?

1567
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:48,190
Okay.

1568
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:49,790
We are going to go to the snail.

1569
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:50,530
Look at my shields.

1570
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:51,150
I have white shields.

1571
00:52:51,390 --> 00:52:52,030
Don't kill them yet.

1572
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:54,410
What I'm going to do, I'm going to crack the shield.

1573
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:55,670
I'm going to melee it.

1574
00:52:55,810 --> 00:52:56,790
See how I got my shield back?

1575
00:52:56,910 --> 00:52:57,610
If you melee...

1576
00:52:57,610 --> 00:52:59,490
You melee to get shield back?

1577
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:00,490
Oh, okay.

1578
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:01,630
You can...

1579
00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:05,450
And so like, imagine a scenario where you've got a player down.

1580
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:06,550
Like, an enemy player down.

1581
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:07,090
Yeah.

1582
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:07,630
And they're crawling.

1583
00:53:07,830 --> 00:53:08,770
And they're waiting to be picked up.

1584
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:09,150
You can...

1585
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:13,110
Instead of just thirsting them with your weapon, you can run up to them and melee the shield and get your shield back.

1586
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:13,610
I see.

1587
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:14,250
Shields up.

1588
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:16,350
I need heavy ammo.

1589
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:16,910
I'm not heavy.

1590
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:17,930
Shotgun ammo.

1591
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:20,070
What color is it?

1592
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:20,510
Red.

1593
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:21,750
You need red?

1594
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:22,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1595
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:23,770
We definitely don't have that.

1596
00:53:23,830 --> 00:53:25,190
But we do have enough power at the shop.

1597
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:25,450
Nice.

1598
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:26,170
So, you can go buy some ammo.

1599
00:53:26,350 --> 00:53:26,550
Okay.

1600
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:26,950
I got some.

1601
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:27,550
No, it's okay.

1602
00:53:27,590 --> 00:53:28,110
I got some.

1603
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:30,870
Okay, guys.

1604
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:31,330
We're learning.

1605
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:32,130
We're getting better.

1606
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:32,470
Okay.

1607
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:33,090
Looks like we're...

1608
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:36,050
Yeah, they're running off with A, but we can just go B instead.

1609
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:36,910
So, let's just do that.

1610
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:39,550
Okay.

1611
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:42,530
The sniper fucking sucks, guys.

1612
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:46,290
That barely does jack shit.

1613
00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:49,270
Do you want a tank?

1614
00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:50,190
Do you want a tank?

1615
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:50,970
Tank?

1616
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:52,030
What do you mean?

1617
00:53:52,570 --> 00:53:53,230
It's a tank.

1618
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:54,390
Oh, there's a tank?

1619
00:53:55,430 --> 00:53:55,830
Okay.

1620
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:56,590
Yes.

1621
00:53:56,690 --> 00:53:58,330
Come up to the front right here and then just press E.

1622
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:00,850
Oh, shit.

1623
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:03,010
And press right.

1624
00:54:05,590 --> 00:54:06,290
I'm right-clicking.

1625
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:06,430
I'm right -clicking.

1626
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:08,370
I killed a snail.

1627
00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:09,670
I ran over a snail.

1628
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:13,250
I'm right-clicking.

1629
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:13,570
I don't hear the music.

1630
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:15,010
I don't know if...

1631
00:54:15,010 --> 00:54:15,530
There it is.

1632
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:16,150
Oh, there it is.

1633
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:17,070
Wait, do I...

1634
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:17,910
Can I run people over?

1635
00:54:18,290 --> 00:54:20,190
Why can't I run over a fucking tree?

1636
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:24,990
If you hit left-click, too, you have a flamethrower on front.

1637
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:25,950
Oh, shit.

1638
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:28,490
Oh, I can't burn the tree down.

1639
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:29,450
It's not worth it.

1640
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:30,970
Let's see if I can get...

1641
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:31,830
Oh, my God.

1642
00:54:31,850 --> 00:54:32,050
Please.

1643
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:33,070
I need a follow-up.

1644
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:33,230
I need a follow-up.

1645
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:34,750
Why didn't I follow the road to get anywhere?

1646
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:39,270
Like, where did I drive to?

1647
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:43,950
Like, where did I drive this thing to?

1648
00:54:44,070 --> 00:54:44,430
It's like...

1649
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:44,750
You're doing...

1650
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:45,270
Oh, my God.

1651
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:47,550
I didn't thread the fucking needle.

1652
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:48,470
There you go.

1653
00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:50,610
You're zooming.

1654
00:54:51,410 --> 00:54:53,050
Oh, my God.

1655
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:53,430
Run.

1656
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:54,530
This is...

1657
00:54:54,530 --> 00:54:57,030
My truck is too tall.

1658
00:54:57,630 --> 00:54:58,590
You want to...

1659
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:01,350
My truck is too fucking tall.

1660
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:04,270
This is bullshit.

1661
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:05,870
Like, where do I fucking hide?

1662
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:07,210
Just stay right there.

1663
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:08,870
You're literally in the tank.

1664
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:14,010
What we're gonna do, I'm gonna try and grab B and we can capture it using this tank.

1665
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:14,870
Okay, okay.

1666
00:55:16,930 --> 00:55:18,430
What can I do?

1667
00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:20,870
Man, that's a big bitch thing.

1668
00:55:21,090 --> 00:55:21,710
Turn around.

1669
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:23,870
Austin powers it.

1670
00:55:23,950 --> 00:55:28,470
My truck is 15 meters and this only accepts 14 meters and under.

1671
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:32,150
Alright.

1672
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:32,630
Alright.

1673
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:34,750
Man, I think you got a bigger bed than you need.

1674
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:35,390
No!

1675
00:55:37,890 --> 00:55:39,650
I can't just force it.

1676
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:42,030
No!

1677
00:55:44,930 --> 00:55:45,410
Yep.

1678
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:47,630
You press E, though, so you can hop back out of the tank.

1679
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:50,710
Don't you dare fucking take it.

1680
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:51,810
What do I do?

1681
00:55:51,970 --> 00:55:53,010
I'm just here.

1682
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:55,510
That was dirty.

1683
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:56,150
That was dirty.

1684
00:55:57,650 --> 00:55:58,930
Guys, I just...

1685
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:01,130
My truck is so poor.

1686
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:01,450
Oh, man.

1687
00:56:04,510 --> 00:56:05,370
What are you gonna do?

1688
00:56:05,410 --> 00:56:06,850
Fucking kill me in the truck?

1689
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:08,010
Get down here.

1690
00:56:08,350 --> 00:56:09,730
Okay, I'm still in the truck.

1691
00:56:10,970 --> 00:56:13,130
I would say just stay in it.

1692
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:15,210
They literally cannot kill you.

1693
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:16,410
Wait, they can't kill me?

1694
00:56:16,670 --> 00:56:17,290
Oh, sweet.

1695
00:56:18,010 --> 00:56:21,230
It's gonna take a fuck-ton to kill you, so that's why I would say stay in it.

1696
00:56:21,310 --> 00:56:24,930
But at the same time, we need to also catch up with you so that way we can...

1697
00:56:24,930 --> 00:56:27,250
Yeah, like, put these outside.

1698
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:29,190
I think they know there's a truck in here.

1699
00:56:29,850 --> 00:56:31,090
Put it in reverse, Terry.

1700
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:31,810
It's okay.

1701
00:56:31,910 --> 00:56:32,730
I'm the getaway car.

1702
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:35,110
The moment you get this, we can get away.

1703
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:36,550
Wait, there's people behind.

1704
00:56:36,870 --> 00:56:37,710
No, that's you guys.

1705
00:56:38,330 --> 00:56:39,030
Yeah, it's us.

1706
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,540
Wait, why am I glitching out?

1707
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:47,320
All right, here, here, here.

1708
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:47,960
Let me drive.

1709
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:49,180
Oh, okay.

1710
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:49,680
Call me a coach.

1711
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:50,320
Okay.

1712
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:53,060
I don't know if you can, like, get past that.

1713
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:55,020
There's, like, a meter thing over there.

1714
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:05,620
Oh, my God.

1715
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:06,040
I have, like...

1716
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:06,660
Oh, there's a purple shield in there.

1717
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:08,220
Oh, I used up all my bullets.

1718
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:11,460
You were trying... Are you fucking kidding me?

1719
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:12,880
There's ammo on this?

1720
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:14,400
Okay, no.

1721
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:16,320
Okay, no.

1722
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:18,020
I was like, there's a purple shield right here.

1723
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:19,220
No, never mind.

1724
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:19,640
Never mind.

1725
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:20,800
It just has four shots.

1726
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:23,520
What are we supposed to do?

1727
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:24,760
I'm sorry.

1728
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:24,980
I'm frustrated.

1729
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:25,580
Okay.

1730
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:27,360
It's always the staff on staff violence.

1731
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,980
I didn't mean to yell at you.

1732
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:30,320
Oh, it's a cooldown.

1733
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:32,980
All right, cool.

1734
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:34,240
So, we're out of here.

1735
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:35,880
We want to try and use...

1736
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:36,800
Wait, but I thought we were supposed to go to B.

1737
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:37,960
No, no.

1738
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:38,980
We are supposed to go to B.

1739
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:43,160
But, like, at the same time, we can also choose to go to C.

1740
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:44,600
We've got three objectives to choose from.

1741
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:46,800
So, it's about, like, adapting to you.

1742
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:47,740
Oh, okay.

1743
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:49,700
You don't have to go to it.

1744
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:50,620
You can just choose not to.

1745
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:53,000
And I think it's the best to just park the car here.

1746
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:55,200
But what if they steal the car?

1747
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,180
There's no way that they will.

1748
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:58,260
There's no way that they will.

1749
00:57:58,340 --> 00:57:58,480
Okay.

1750
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:01,860
I think they're gonna steal the car, guys.

1751
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:03,480
I am literally Megamind right now.

1752
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,600
I think they're gonna steal the car, guys.

1753
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,060
I can't promise that they won't.

1754
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:08,280
But I don't think that they will.

1755
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:10,940
If I see a fucking tank, I'm gonna steal it.

1756
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:16,120
I would 100% steal a tank.

1757
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:22,120
Guys, I think we're gonna come back and then the tank is gone.

1758
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:24,220
What?

1759
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:31,760
Wait.

1760
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:34,460
Steal bow... Oh, they're still fighting!

1761
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:37,440
What the fuck is going on?

1762
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:39,840
I'm so confused.

1763
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:40,900
I can't climb!

1764
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:42,700
You know what, Toki?

1765
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:43,360
We're not gonna go that way.

1766
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:43,860
We're gonna go this way.

1767
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:44,600
Wait, I'm here.

1768
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:46,780
We're gonna go up the ladder.

1769
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:48,040
But I'm here.

1770
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:49,320
You're here?

1771
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:49,880
What do you mean you're here?

1772
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:51,380
One right here.

1773
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:51,920
Oh, in front of you!

1774
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,020
Come here, come here, come here!

1775
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,060
Oh my god, he's so low!

1776
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:58,300
Oh, nice.

1777
00:58:58,460 --> 00:58:59,020
I got one down.

1778
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:00,080
There's one guy on me.

1779
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,580
But I don't know where he went.

1780
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:04,200
Yeah, he has the bio cord too, so we definitely need to kill him.

1781
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,720
Wait, how did I get damaged?

1782
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:09,460
Nice,

1783
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:14,080
okay.

1784
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:15,040
Let's shield swap.

1785
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:16,800
Wait, I'm like low HP.

1786
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,040
I don't know how I got damaged.

1787
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:21,220
Uh, here you can take this.

1788
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:23,280
Oh, I picked that up by yourself.

1789
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,060
I just picked it up.

1790
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:25,400
I tried to dodge it.

1791
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:26,560
What?

1792
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:29,860
Ooh, ooh, oh, Toki, Toki, get this gun, get this gun right here.

1793
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:30,140
This gun?

1794
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:30,600
Okay.

1795
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:32,040
Best gun in the game.

1796
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:32,880
Oh, okay.

1797
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:33,320
Hands down.

1798
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:37,840
So, the way that it works, it is a multi-fire burst, but...

1799
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:38,240
Yeah?

1800
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:39,540
Oh, he's gonna shout at me.

1801
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:43,780
Um, it is a multi-fire burst, but it does a shit ton of damage to shields.

1802
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:44,980
What the fuck?

1803
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:45,560
What hurt me?

1804
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:46,760
It will, it will...

1805
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:49,820
So, it's not that it's hurting you, there's this little thing around the map.

1806
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:50,500
Um...

1807
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:50,900
Yeah?

1808
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:54,640
And that truck, whenever it's activated, it can turn off technology.

1809
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:58,800
So it can shut doors, lock them down, and turn off, like, and shut off your shields.

1810
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:02,860
Wait, oh, okay, so the enemy team did that, or is it just an event?

1811
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:04,540
Yeah, an enemy team did it.

1812
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:05,160
Oh, okay.

1813
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:06,560
It is an event, though.

1814
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:08,020
Like, it's a manual triggered event.

1815
01:00:12,630 --> 01:00:13,330
Yeah, shut...

1816
01:00:13,330 --> 01:00:14,010
Cover me, I'm reloading.

1817
01:00:14,190 --> 01:00:15,370
...the Bio-Core holder.

1818
01:00:15,510 --> 01:00:18,350
This is something we definitely want to push now, because it's the last remaining Bio-Core.

1819
01:00:18,430 --> 01:00:18,650
Okay.

1820
01:00:19,870 --> 01:00:21,210
Guys, I think they stole the truck.

1821
01:00:21,330 --> 01:00:22,350
There's someone behind you, there's someone behind you.

1822
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:22,570
Oh.

1823
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:24,530
What?

1824
01:00:24,710 --> 01:00:25,390
I didn't reload!

1825
01:00:25,550 --> 01:00:26,610
I didn't reload again!

1826
01:00:29,010 --> 01:00:31,430
Okay, I, I, I need to learn to reload.

1827
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:33,010
Wait, what?

1828
01:00:36,610 --> 01:00:38,430
Oh, it's just very limited.

1829
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:40,130
The ammo per shot.

1830
01:00:40,990 --> 01:00:41,350
Okay.

1831
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:42,510
Yeah, yeah.

1832
01:00:42,530 --> 01:00:48,050
So, it's like an eight burst shot, but I'm telling you, like, once you, once you kind of, like, figure it out, like, it rips.

1833
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:49,250
It's insanely good.

1834
01:00:49,410 --> 01:00:49,890
Oh, I see.

1835
01:00:50,050 --> 01:00:50,630
I see.

1836
01:00:52,310 --> 01:00:52,670
Okay.

1837
01:00:57,010 --> 01:00:57,910
It has, like...

1838
01:00:57,910 --> 01:00:58,830
No, it has, like...

1839
01:00:58,830 --> 01:01:01,030
Yeah, no, it has eight rounds, but it's so fast.

1840
01:01:01,030 --> 01:01:02,930
And if you also, uh, pull out your pistol, it will run a little bit faster, as well.

1841
01:01:03,710 --> 01:01:04,990
Oh, so it's, like, normal.

1842
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:06,610
I might need...

1843
01:01:06,610 --> 01:01:07,110
Is there heals?

1844
01:01:07,890 --> 01:01:08,830
I'm, I'm low.

1845
01:01:09,350 --> 01:01:09,730
I'm HP.

1846
01:01:09,730 --> 01:01:10,210
Yeah, you are low.

1847
01:01:10,210 --> 01:01:10,470
I'm HP.

1848
01:01:10,470 --> 01:01:10,750
I'm HP.

1849
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:10,770
I'm HP.

1850
01:01:10,770 --> 01:01:12,830
You might have some shield repairs on you.

1851
01:01:13,030 --> 01:01:13,910
Do you see, like...

1852
01:01:13,910 --> 01:01:14,070
What?

1853
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:14,210
Shield repairs?

1854
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:16,110
You might have shield repairs.

1855
01:01:16,310 --> 01:01:19,390
Press, like, look, hold your four key, and you'll bring up the, the healing wheel.

1856
01:01:19,890 --> 01:01:20,250
No.

1857
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:22,990
That means you ain't got shit, then.

1858
01:01:23,790 --> 01:01:24,510
That's nothing.

1859
01:01:25,230 --> 01:01:26,290
There's a sniper behind us.

1860
01:01:26,310 --> 01:01:26,630
Couple, couple.

1861
01:01:26,810 --> 01:01:27,430
Oh, shit.

1862
01:01:27,830 --> 01:01:28,490
I'm lefty.

1863
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:30,010
I'm gonna kill this snail.

1864
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:31,390
Oh, shit!

1865
01:01:32,450 --> 01:01:33,290
Yeah, yeah, kill the snail.

1866
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:33,530
You got it.

1867
01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:34,710
No, no, there's a guy behind me.

1868
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:35,810
Okay, I'm coming.

1869
01:01:36,170 --> 01:01:36,910
I'm holding your hand.

1870
01:01:36,910 --> 01:01:37,210
I'm holding your hand.

1871
01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:37,930
Oh, what the fuck?

1872
01:01:39,710 --> 01:01:40,470
What the fuck?

1873
01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:40,650
Hit!

1874
01:01:40,670 --> 01:01:40,750
Hit!

1875
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:41,330
What?

1876
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:42,870
He's way over here.

1877
01:01:43,210 --> 01:01:43,310
I...

1878
01:01:44,470 --> 01:01:45,110
It's Winston.

1879
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:46,730
He, he also has a midnight surge.

1880
01:01:46,990 --> 01:01:47,730
That's his gun.

1881
01:01:47,790 --> 01:01:48,130
Oh!

1882
01:01:48,390 --> 01:01:49,050
How do I...

1883
01:01:49,730 --> 01:01:50,490
Oh, respawn.

1884
01:01:50,550 --> 01:01:50,750
Okay.

1885
01:01:50,830 --> 01:01:51,750
I was like, what hit?

1886
01:01:51,810 --> 01:01:52,810
I died so fast!

1887
01:01:54,810 --> 01:01:56,630
I just wanted to punch some snails.

1888
01:01:56,650 --> 01:01:56,690
He's down.

1889
01:01:56,690 --> 01:01:56,810
He's down.

1890
01:01:56,810 --> 01:01:57,010
He's down.

1891
01:01:57,030 --> 01:01:57,230
He's down.

1892
01:01:57,230 --> 01:01:57,450
He's down.

1893
01:01:57,450 --> 01:01:57,570
He's down.

1894
01:01:57,910 --> 01:01:58,310
He's down.

1895
01:01:58,310 --> 01:01:58,490
He's down.

1896
01:02:07,310 --> 01:02:08,110
He's down.

1897
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:13,530
He's down.

1898
01:02:14,550 --> 01:02:14,910
Nice.

1899
01:02:17,430 --> 01:02:20,090
Alright, I'm rushing towards the sea right now.

1900
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:20,910
Are y'all in a car?

1901
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:22,370
Yeah, we're coming over.

1902
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:27,570
We're figuring it out as we go along.

1903
01:02:28,210 --> 01:02:28,690
Oh, wait!

1904
01:02:28,710 --> 01:02:29,530
A tank is still here!

1905
01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:31,850
Wait, nobody stole the tank!

1906
01:02:32,570 --> 01:02:33,130
Oh, there's a tree.

1907
01:02:34,630 --> 01:02:34,990
What?

1908
01:02:35,070 --> 01:02:35,410
Don't mind me.

1909
01:02:35,450 --> 01:02:35,670
It's okay.

1910
01:02:35,770 --> 01:02:36,390
I haven't got my license.

1911
01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:38,890
Oh, my God.

1912
01:02:39,350 --> 01:02:40,010
Put it on.

1913
01:02:40,030 --> 01:02:40,690
Put it on.

1914
01:02:41,230 --> 01:02:42,210
Put it on.

1915
01:02:42,210 --> 01:02:42,430
Put it on.

1916
01:02:42,430 --> 01:02:42,710
Oh, yeah.

1917
01:02:42,730 --> 01:02:43,430
They asked if I...

1918
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:43,850
If I...

1919
01:02:43,870 --> 01:02:47,030
If I'm in the option, you can put streamer mode on, and I feel a little wild today.

1920
01:02:49,930 --> 01:02:52,950
I didn't do my homework, and I'm fucking playing...

1921
01:02:52,950 --> 01:02:54,050
Oh, shit!

1922
01:02:55,570 --> 01:02:56,810
We are in the open.

1923
01:02:56,890 --> 01:02:57,650
I don't like that.

1924
01:02:58,490 --> 01:02:59,410
This is not great.

1925
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:05,250
Oh, I'm okay, but I don't know for how long, because I'm very low.

1926
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:07,470
Run, run, run, run.

1927
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:08,750
I don't think I can run.

1928
01:03:08,830 --> 01:03:09,990
I'm gonna have to die here.

1929
01:03:14,350 --> 01:03:15,350
Oh, no way.

1930
01:03:15,350 --> 01:03:15,670
Oh, no way, bro.

1931
01:03:15,830 --> 01:03:16,350
All right.

1932
01:03:16,350 --> 01:03:17,370
Well, that was my last try.

1933
01:03:17,730 --> 01:03:18,530
I'm big dead.

1934
01:03:18,810 --> 01:03:19,530
You have the wrong dude to mess with.

1935
01:03:20,050 --> 01:03:21,130
Sniper on the prowl.

1936
01:03:21,150 --> 01:03:22,750
Trying to ruin my totally bitching day.

1937
01:03:23,490 --> 01:03:24,070
Man down.

1938
01:03:24,290 --> 01:03:25,470
We'll miss you out there, buddy.

1939
01:03:25,630 --> 01:03:26,510
No stress, Doki.

1940
01:03:26,610 --> 01:03:27,050
It's all you.

1941
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:27,930
You win this.

1942
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:28,130
Easy.

1943
01:03:28,130 --> 01:03:28,150
Oh, hey.

1944
01:03:28,150 --> 01:03:29,630
I don't think so, because...

1945
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:32,630
What the fuck?

1946
01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:33,710
That should have been a hit.

1947
01:03:33,770 --> 01:03:34,030
You can easily...

1948
01:03:34,690 --> 01:03:35,050
No!

1949
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:36,610
It's okay.

1950
01:03:36,690 --> 01:03:37,290
I still have a life.

1951
01:03:38,230 --> 01:03:39,050
You do have a life.

1952
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:39,810
That should have been a hit.

1953
01:03:40,210 --> 01:03:40,570
You're free.

1954
01:03:42,410 --> 01:03:42,990
All right.

1955
01:03:43,630 --> 01:03:44,350
Last respawn.

1956
01:03:44,370 --> 01:03:44,510
Wait.

1957
01:03:44,650 --> 01:03:45,210
Can I...

1958
01:03:45,210 --> 01:03:45,330
Can I...

1959
01:03:45,350 --> 01:03:46,290
Can I buy people back?

1960
01:03:46,630 --> 01:03:47,130
How do I...

1961
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:47,430
You can.

1962
01:03:48,070 --> 01:03:49,610
How do I buy people back?

1963
01:03:50,330 --> 01:03:54,590
You got to go to a computer called a resurrection point, so...

1964
01:03:54,590 --> 01:03:55,270
Do I have the money?

1965
01:03:55,530 --> 01:03:57,810
You have to have power, which we did, to buy them back.

1966
01:03:57,870 --> 01:03:58,710
It's very much like Call of Duty.

1967
01:03:58,770 --> 01:03:59,070
Oh, okay.

1968
01:03:59,230 --> 01:04:00,310
I think I have the money.

1969
01:04:00,310 --> 01:04:01,190
I didn't spend anything.

1970
01:04:01,850 --> 01:04:02,790
Yeah, you should have the money.

1971
01:04:02,850 --> 01:04:03,710
But I also think that's the game.

1972
01:04:03,890 --> 01:04:04,110
Oh, no.

1973
01:04:04,170 --> 01:04:04,750
It's still being held up.

1974
01:04:05,610 --> 01:04:06,170
Okay, so...

1975
01:04:06,170 --> 01:04:06,570
No, I...

1976
01:04:06,570 --> 01:04:07,870
Oh, wait.

1977
01:04:07,930 --> 01:04:08,470
I don't.

1978
01:04:09,370 --> 01:04:10,110
No, that's defensive.

1979
01:04:10,290 --> 01:04:10,510
Wait.

1980
01:04:10,570 --> 01:04:10,830
What?

1981
01:04:10,830 --> 01:04:11,410
Where is it?

1982
01:04:11,990 --> 01:04:12,330
So...

1983
01:04:17,010 --> 01:04:17,830
I'm moving here.

1984
01:04:17,870 --> 01:04:18,550
There you go.

1985
01:04:18,590 --> 01:04:18,810
All right.

1986
01:04:18,850 --> 01:04:20,430
So, you have a waypoint marker.

1987
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:21,170
Oh, I see it.

1988
01:04:21,170 --> 01:04:21,670
I see it.

1989
01:04:21,670 --> 01:04:22,070
It's pink.

1990
01:04:22,970 --> 01:04:23,470
Yeah, yeah.

1991
01:04:23,990 --> 01:04:25,150
Get in the car and drive there.

1992
01:04:25,650 --> 01:04:26,350
Oh, my God.

1993
01:04:26,370 --> 01:04:27,730
It's 200 meters away?

1994
01:04:28,270 --> 01:04:28,830
Yeah, I know.

1995
01:04:28,870 --> 01:04:29,250
That's far.

1996
01:04:29,450 --> 01:04:29,750
Okay.

1997
01:04:29,770 --> 01:04:30,110
Also, yes.

1998
01:04:30,390 --> 01:04:30,750
Yes.

1999
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:31,390
I thought it was like...

2000
01:04:31,390 --> 01:04:31,590
Wow.

2001
01:04:31,790 --> 01:04:32,250
Oh, God.

2002
01:04:32,550 --> 01:04:33,970
The camera on here sucks.

2003
01:04:34,110 --> 01:04:34,610
Like, yeah.

2004
01:04:34,610 --> 01:04:35,650
We were very aware of it.

2005
01:04:35,730 --> 01:04:36,230
We fixed it.

2006
01:04:36,590 --> 01:04:36,970
Oh, God.

2007
01:04:37,830 --> 01:04:38,590
I'm getting off.

2008
01:04:38,610 --> 01:04:38,950
I'm sorry.

2009
01:04:39,550 --> 01:04:40,250
No, that's fair.

2010
01:04:42,410 --> 01:04:43,890
That's not a very good car.

2011
01:04:45,410 --> 01:04:46,550
I don't blame you.

2012
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:48,610
Wait.

2013
01:04:48,710 --> 01:04:50,510
Why is there a number five on my screen?

2014
01:04:51,370 --> 01:04:53,730
So, that top left corner says steal bio core.

2015
01:04:54,110 --> 01:04:54,470
Yeah.

2016
01:04:55,150 --> 01:04:58,370
That is the timer and how much longer you need to wait to...

2017
01:04:58,370 --> 01:05:01,090
How much time you have left to steal the bio core from somebody.

2018
01:05:01,170 --> 01:05:01,730
Oh, I see.

2019
01:05:01,730 --> 01:05:03,130
Four seconds away from capturing it.

2020
01:05:03,270 --> 01:05:04,690
No time for naps now, my friend.

2021
01:05:04,850 --> 01:05:05,930
We need to get back in the action.

2022
01:05:05,930 --> 01:05:06,010
Okay.

2023
01:05:06,010 --> 01:05:06,250
I got it.

2024
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:07,850
You can tell me about heaven later.

2025
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:08,830
Because now, right now...

2026
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:10,830
Do we go to...

2027
01:05:10,830 --> 01:05:11,110
Right now.

2028
01:05:11,110 --> 01:05:11,350
Now, get it.

2029
01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:11,610
Oh, don't.

2030
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:11,990
Get back here.

2031
01:05:12,430 --> 01:05:13,010
We're gonna go.

2032
01:05:13,030 --> 01:05:13,270
We're gonna go.

2033
01:05:13,270 --> 01:05:13,410
Okay.

2034
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:13,850
We're gonna go.

2035
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:15,610
Wait.

2036
01:05:15,630 --> 01:05:16,210
Why are we...

2037
01:05:16,210 --> 01:05:16,310
That's the end.

2038
01:05:16,390 --> 01:05:16,990
One last time.

2039
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:17,570
Why are we going...

2040
01:05:17,570 --> 01:05:18,190
Oh, my God.

2041
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:19,690
What is going on over here, dude?

2042
01:05:19,910 --> 01:05:21,810
Why are we going away from the bio core?

2043
01:05:22,530 --> 01:05:26,490
I have to go around a little bit here because driving through all that was a pain in the ass.

2044
01:05:26,770 --> 01:05:27,130
Oh.

2045
01:05:28,170 --> 01:05:29,530
We're not gonna make it.

2046
01:05:29,970 --> 01:05:30,330
We're...

2047
01:05:30,330 --> 01:05:31,110
Oh, boy.

2048
01:05:31,110 --> 01:05:31,790
You never know.

2049
01:05:31,890 --> 01:05:32,070
Never know.

2050
01:05:32,070 --> 01:05:33,310
We're not gonna make it.

2051
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:34,830
We should go.

2052
01:05:35,510 --> 01:05:38,190
This is the longest two seconds of my life.

2053
01:05:39,790 --> 01:05:40,770
I found another car.

2054
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:41,130
It's fine.

2055
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:41,350
It's fine.

2056
01:05:42,070 --> 01:05:42,590
I'm with you.

2057
01:05:42,650 --> 01:05:42,910
I'm with you.

2058
01:05:42,970 --> 01:05:43,330
I'm with you.

2059
01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:43,410
I'm with you.

2060
01:05:44,790 --> 01:05:47,310
Oh, it's the final countdown, guys.

2061
01:05:47,490 --> 01:05:47,790
Two.

2062
01:05:48,590 --> 01:05:50,810
Guys, it's still at two, guys.

2063
01:05:51,330 --> 01:05:54,130
This is the longest two seconds of my life.

2064
01:05:54,210 --> 01:05:55,210
Honey, I'm coming home.

2065
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:55,710
Honey.

2066
01:05:56,090 --> 01:05:58,330
That's the longest two seconds.

2067
01:05:59,450 --> 01:06:01,710
It's still at two.

2068
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:03,590
Where am I?

2069
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:05,130
I'm not controlling the cat.

2070
01:06:05,230 --> 01:06:05,550
One.

2071
01:06:06,070 --> 01:06:07,850
Oh, no.

2072
01:06:08,870 --> 01:06:09,670
We got that.

2073
01:06:10,110 --> 01:06:11,010
We're here.

2074
01:06:11,570 --> 01:06:12,770
We're at least...

2075
01:06:12,770 --> 01:06:13,830
Oh, my God.

2076
01:06:13,830 --> 01:06:13,850
Oh, my God.

2077
01:06:13,890 --> 01:06:13,970
I'm so sorry.

2078
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:14,870
Come on.

2079
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:15,650
Get away, bro.

2080
01:06:15,950 --> 01:06:17,190
At least we're here.

2081
01:06:19,590 --> 01:06:20,030
Okay.

2082
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:20,950
I'm learning.

2083
01:06:22,150 --> 01:06:22,910
It's not fair.

2084
01:06:22,990 --> 01:06:24,310
These guys know how they play the game.

2085
01:06:24,470 --> 01:06:25,630
You guys know how...

2086
01:06:25,630 --> 01:06:26,230
It's so unfair though.

2087
01:06:26,730 --> 01:06:27,990
First game, you're fine.

2088
01:06:27,990 --> 01:06:29,810
Guys, they know how to play the game, guys.

2089
01:06:30,030 --> 01:06:30,270
I...

2090
01:06:30,270 --> 01:06:31,950
This is my first game.

2091
01:06:32,330 --> 01:06:33,270
This is...

2092
01:06:36,170 --> 01:06:37,830
We didn't even use the...

2093
01:06:37,830 --> 01:06:39,010
We didn't even use the tank.

2094
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:41,090
We didn't use the tank.

2095
01:06:44,310 --> 01:06:46,250
Guys, we didn't use the tank, okay?

2096
01:06:47,410 --> 01:06:48,550
That's why we lost.

2097
01:06:48,890 --> 01:06:50,830
We didn't get to use the tank.

2098
01:06:55,710 --> 01:06:57,610
Don't miss out for future.

2099
01:06:59,650 --> 01:07:01,390
Alright, we figured it out, guys.

2100
01:07:01,610 --> 01:07:03,310
Now it's so open.

2101
01:07:03,330 --> 01:07:04,270
The sniper fucking sucks.

2102
01:07:04,410 --> 01:07:07,170
That's what I figured out.

2103
01:07:07,330 --> 01:07:12,710
The sniper is... It's all about close range, I feel like.

2104
01:07:15,630 --> 01:07:16,850
Turn that down a little?

2105
01:07:17,090 --> 01:07:19,090
I feel like it should be the sound effects, right?

2106
01:07:19,690 --> 01:07:21,550
Maybe I just need to turn it down a little more.

2107
01:07:22,570 --> 01:07:24,110
Play sound in the background?

2108
01:07:24,490 --> 01:07:25,810
What the fuck does that mean?

2109
01:07:26,530 --> 01:07:27,350
I'll just play this.

2110
01:07:27,450 --> 01:07:28,250
Put that lower.

2111
01:07:30,110 --> 01:07:31,550
Okay, let's test the gun out.

2112
01:07:31,610 --> 01:07:33,310
Yeah, let me know if it fixes it.

2113
01:07:37,030 --> 01:07:38,650
What the fuck is this?

2114
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:42,410
Oh, it's a Demoman!

2115
01:07:43,950 --> 01:07:44,830
It's Demoman!

2116
01:07:45,230 --> 01:07:45,630
Okay.

2117
01:07:46,510 --> 01:07:47,250
Let me know.

2118
01:07:47,650 --> 01:07:49,150
Let me know, sound guy.

2119
01:07:52,630 --> 01:07:53,710
Is it better?

2120
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:55,110
Yeah!

2121
01:08:05,810 --> 01:08:06,850
Try another gun?

2122
01:08:07,070 --> 01:08:08,470
Okay, I'll try the battle rifle.

2123
01:08:11,650 --> 01:08:13,170
Oh, this one you have to click.

2124
01:08:13,230 --> 01:08:14,110
You can't hold this.

2125
01:08:15,150 --> 01:08:16,710
There's so many different guns.

2126
01:08:16,910 --> 01:08:18,450
That was a match of chaos.

2127
01:08:19,790 --> 01:08:20,490
Indeed, indeed.

2128
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:21,610
Okay.

2129
01:08:21,750 --> 01:08:22,750
Yo, froggy, man.

2130
01:08:22,810 --> 01:08:23,970
This is so slow.

2131
01:08:24,050 --> 01:08:24,850
It's a very slow gun.

2132
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:25,790
Oh, this is the heal gun!

2133
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:27,870
And then there's the shotgun.

2134
01:08:30,870 --> 01:08:33,470
Shotgun sounds like a gun.

2135
01:08:33,470 --> 01:08:35,170
You may have to talk to Kimmy again.

2136
01:08:37,770 --> 01:08:38,250
Yeah.

2137
01:08:38,250 --> 01:08:39,790
There's so many different guns.

2138
01:08:42,030 --> 01:08:44,750
I feel like the sniper fucking sucks.

2139
01:08:44,990 --> 01:08:46,790
That's not... That's my opinion.

2140
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:48,170
Out of all the guns...

2141
01:08:49,010 --> 01:08:53,530
The sniper... What is this supposed to... The sniper damage is not that great.

2142
01:08:54,710 --> 01:08:57,010
Or like the projectile is so slow.

2143
01:08:57,550 --> 01:09:00,330
There were moments where I was like, that had to be a hit.

2144
01:09:00,490 --> 01:09:01,010
You know?

2145
01:09:01,570 --> 01:09:04,110
I was like, that should be a hit, but it didn't hit.

2146
01:09:04,470 --> 01:09:08,670
I don't know if it's like the projectile... It's not like full hit scan or something.

2147
01:09:13,110 --> 01:09:14,810
Yeah, the damage is pretty meh.

2148
01:09:14,890 --> 01:09:16,390
That's what I didn't like about the sniper.

2149
01:09:16,810 --> 01:09:19,930
I feel like the damage was better on the other guns.

2150
01:09:20,930 --> 01:09:22,430
Nah, this one's cooler.

2151
01:09:24,090 --> 01:09:25,930
This is the best sniper apparently.

2152
01:09:26,170 --> 01:09:27,050
Is this the best sniper?

2153
01:09:27,430 --> 01:09:28,790
Yeah, it is.

2154
01:09:29,450 --> 01:09:30,470
Or this one.

2155
01:09:30,710 --> 01:09:31,470
It's purple.

2156
01:09:32,410 --> 01:09:32,970
Oh!

2157
01:09:33,690 --> 01:09:35,010
That's a good damage.

2158
01:09:36,370 --> 01:09:36,930
Yeah.

2159
01:09:38,030 --> 01:09:39,690
Tire... Tire hard or whatever?

2160
01:09:40,550 --> 01:09:41,670
That's good damage.

2161
01:09:46,310 --> 01:09:47,830
That's a really good damage.

2162
01:09:48,510 --> 01:09:51,590
Yeah, that's... That's Kraber right there.

2163
01:09:52,810 --> 01:09:53,890
I want a 1v1.

2164
01:09:54,110 --> 01:09:55,570
Oh wait, is this a shop?

2165
01:09:55,770 --> 01:09:56,750
He's still in the lobby.

2166
01:09:56,990 --> 01:09:57,870
He's still in his lobby.

2167
01:09:57,990 --> 01:09:58,350
Froggy.

2168
01:09:59,910 --> 01:10:02,050
He's still... He's still down below.

2169
01:10:02,530 --> 01:10:03,930
I got to talk to Gibby.

2170
01:10:04,190 --> 01:10:04,810
He's bouncing around.

2171
01:10:06,090 --> 01:10:06,770
Well done.

2172
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:07,210
Okay.

2173
01:10:09,190 --> 01:10:10,510
This is so... Okay.

2174
01:10:11,150 --> 01:10:13,090
The whole theme is 80s, guys.

2175
01:10:15,150 --> 01:10:16,950
I'm tired of losing these gunfights to him.

2176
01:10:17,930 --> 01:10:19,130
There's more to them.

2177
01:10:19,630 --> 01:10:20,750
You might realize...

2178
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:21,730
Froggy is a nuisance.

2179
01:10:21,730 --> 01:10:23,970
To get some insights into the more advanced functions.

2180
01:10:24,150 --> 01:10:25,010
Turn over to Chip.

2181
01:10:25,270 --> 01:10:27,650
How do I swap my loadout?

2182
01:10:27,870 --> 01:10:28,050
Shop.

2183
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:28,510
Okay.

2184
01:10:29,170 --> 01:10:30,430
I completed it.

2185
01:10:31,510 --> 01:10:33,390
I want to swap my loadout.

2186
01:10:33,570 --> 01:10:34,070
Oh wait.

2187
01:10:35,490 --> 01:10:38,510
He's got this... Yeah, it's basically 80s.

2188
01:10:39,270 --> 01:10:42,370
I'm surprised they got the music rights for the final countdown.

2189
01:10:44,090 --> 01:10:45,370
Tell me about the shops.

2190
01:10:46,670 --> 01:10:47,810
There are two things you can do.

2191
01:10:48,150 --> 01:10:48,670
Banking.

2192
01:10:48,710 --> 01:10:50,190
And your team to spend later.

2193
01:10:50,190 --> 01:10:52,130
Using any held or banked prize.

2194
01:10:52,170 --> 01:10:52,970
Something nice for yourself.

2195
01:10:53,930 --> 01:10:54,490
Yeah.

2196
01:10:54,870 --> 01:10:55,430
Wait.

2197
01:10:55,670 --> 01:10:56,150
So...

2198
01:10:56,150 --> 01:10:56,510
I do.

2199
01:10:56,790 --> 01:10:57,770
That's... Okay.

2200
01:10:57,890 --> 01:10:58,670
That's pretty crazy.

2201
01:10:59,910 --> 01:11:06,530
So it's very, very highly incentivized for everyone on the team to come and deposit their bank.

2202
01:11:06,670 --> 01:11:09,090
Because it gives everyone on the team money.

2203
01:11:09,230 --> 01:11:12,390
But if I'm spending cash, it doesn't affect the cash that you guys have.

2204
01:11:13,070 --> 01:11:13,710
Yeah, exactly.

2205
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:15,430
Wow.

2206
01:11:16,250 --> 01:11:16,910
Cool concept.

2207
01:11:17,750 --> 01:11:18,310
Very.

2208
01:11:19,190 --> 01:11:20,310
I'm doing a tutorial.

2209
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:22,010
Because I didn't want to buy stuff.

2210
01:11:22,110 --> 01:11:25,050
That first match, I have only bought literally two things.

2211
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:27,710
I don't want to take from other people.

2212
01:11:27,830 --> 01:11:29,230
But yeah, that's actually really freaking dope.

2213
01:11:29,810 --> 01:11:34,090
Yeah, it's kind of hard to explain that concept without the guide you get given.

2214
01:11:34,130 --> 01:11:35,650
You have to actually work together.

2215
01:11:37,230 --> 01:11:37,670
Okay.

2216
01:11:38,270 --> 01:11:40,770
Yeah, I already... No, please don't show me again.

2217
01:11:40,830 --> 01:11:42,270
I thought this was over.

2218
01:11:42,470 --> 01:11:44,550
I thought the tutorial was over.

2219
01:11:45,790 --> 01:11:47,630
It's like, let me show that again.

2220
01:11:47,630 --> 01:11:48,910
How did they...

2221
01:11:48,910 --> 01:11:49,850
How did they...

2222
01:11:49,850 --> 01:11:51,790
Oh, is this part of the Power Glove?

2223
01:11:51,950 --> 01:11:53,290
My homeboy said, y'all hiring.

2224
01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:56,290
Oh.

2225
01:11:59,150 --> 01:12:00,190
I see.

2226
01:12:00,310 --> 01:12:01,190
So I'm healing.

2227
01:12:03,650 --> 01:12:04,510
I heal.

2228
01:12:05,150 --> 01:12:05,910
I'm healing.

2229
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:06,350
I'm healing.

2230
01:12:06,670 --> 01:12:08,290
Oh, that's a heal.

2231
01:12:08,510 --> 01:12:10,950
I thought that was a fucking Gibraltar shield.

2232
01:12:11,210 --> 01:12:13,230
That's why I didn't shoot the fucking yellow aura.

2233
01:12:13,710 --> 01:12:16,450
I was like, that's a barrier right there.

2234
01:12:16,450 --> 01:12:17,210
Oh!

2235
01:12:18,170 --> 01:12:20,230
That was a fucking...

2236
01:12:20,230 --> 01:12:21,030
Okay.

2237
01:12:21,370 --> 01:12:24,010
I was like, oh, I'm going to stop shooting that.

2238
01:12:24,070 --> 01:12:25,210
That's a heal.

2239
01:12:27,770 --> 01:12:30,250
That was a fucking barrier.

2240
01:12:32,530 --> 01:12:35,970
I'm this purple because it's based off my girlfriend.

2241
01:12:36,090 --> 01:12:36,730
She has purple hair.

2242
01:12:36,830 --> 01:12:37,730
It's her favorite color too.

2243
01:12:38,150 --> 01:12:39,230
I see.

2244
01:12:40,050 --> 01:12:42,490
You watch exactly what you're trying to shoot.

2245
01:12:42,990 --> 01:12:43,750
I see.

2246
01:12:44,210 --> 01:12:44,790
I'm warded.

2247
01:12:45,670 --> 01:12:46,830
I'm figuring it out.

2248
01:12:47,010 --> 01:12:47,170
Okay, guys.

2249
01:12:47,170 --> 01:12:47,350
So.

2250
01:12:47,470 --> 01:12:48,110
How do people have names?

2251
01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:54,150
Before we get started in the game two here, you might have... you might have... you will have another objective from Gibi.

2252
01:12:54,990 --> 01:12:56,570
Ico, did you run them through this yet by chance?

2253
01:12:57,010 --> 01:12:58,530
I have an objective from Gibi?

2254
01:12:58,550 --> 01:12:58,570
Yeah.

2255
01:12:58,630 --> 01:13:00,770
I talked to a few of them here at the time.

2256
01:13:02,590 --> 01:13:03,070
All right.

2257
01:13:03,090 --> 01:13:03,190
Cool.

2258
01:13:03,310 --> 01:13:03,750
Do I?

2259
01:13:04,010 --> 01:13:05,990
If you haven't talked to Gibi, go talk to Gibi.

2260
01:13:06,030 --> 01:13:09,050
Complete the rest of the objectives after you're done talking to Gibi.

2261
01:13:09,050 --> 01:13:10,670
He showed me the shop four times.

2262
01:13:10,670 --> 01:13:10,790
You can go talk to the chip.

2263
01:13:10,810 --> 01:13:12,210
He's going to yap like I do.

2264
01:13:12,330 --> 01:13:14,770
And then once you're done talking to the chip, you're going to do one action here.

2265
01:13:18,730 --> 01:13:21,130
Why do I still need to talk to him?

2266
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:22,630
He's just saying the same thing.

2267
01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:25,110
Yeah, we're going to stick with the same team.

2268
01:13:27,850 --> 01:13:29,530
Unfortunately, we can't bring Grim in.

2269
01:13:29,750 --> 01:13:32,470
It looks like our game is just not working with him at all.

2270
01:13:32,930 --> 01:13:37,890
We're going to put him out of his misery today and not waste his time.

2271
01:13:38,110 --> 01:13:38,830
That couldn't be me.

2272
01:13:39,110 --> 01:13:40,910
I did my homework and I showed up.

2273
01:13:44,210 --> 01:13:47,670
Oh, I have to talk to him after he shows me stuff?

2274
01:13:48,490 --> 01:13:50,550
Now let's pretend you're carrying another 100 pounds.

2275
01:13:50,590 --> 01:13:51,870
Go ahead and pop it in.

2276
01:13:53,070 --> 01:13:53,510
So...

2277
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:56,930
Oh, that's why I kept repeating it.

2278
01:13:57,010 --> 01:13:58,350
I just had a question and it just left me.

2279
01:14:00,390 --> 01:14:01,610
What's the target price for this?

2280
01:14:02,970 --> 01:14:03,850
Good question.

2281
01:14:03,950 --> 01:14:05,110
I know, but I can't share it.

2282
01:14:05,530 --> 01:14:09,710
But I can say...

2283
01:14:09,710 --> 01:14:10,590
But I can say...

2284
01:14:10,910 --> 01:14:14,010
This is not going to be Call of Duty levels of expensive.

2285
01:14:15,210 --> 01:14:17,250
Guys, I get to play this for free.

2286
01:14:19,810 --> 01:14:23,730
We know it's not $70 for the base.

2287
01:14:25,730 --> 01:14:27,710
$195 for the next edition.

2288
01:14:27,950 --> 01:14:29,830
Well, I mean, you don't actually know that.

2289
01:14:29,930 --> 01:14:33,510
He simply said it's not going to be Call of Duty levels of expensive.

2290
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:37,670
That doesn't tell us if it's going to be higher than Call of Duty.

2291
01:14:37,970 --> 01:14:39,410
Or lower than Call of Duty.

2292
01:14:41,450 --> 01:14:42,630
I'll tell you right now.

2293
01:14:42,710 --> 01:14:44,030
It's not going to be $70.

2294
01:14:44,110 --> 01:14:45,330
And it ain't going to be...

2295
01:14:45,790 --> 01:14:47,230
Honestly, I thought it was going to be free to play.

2296
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:48,910
Talk to Gibby.

2297
01:14:49,330 --> 01:14:50,350
It's not going to be $65.

2298
01:14:50,530 --> 01:14:51,610
I can say that.

2299
01:14:51,730 --> 01:14:52,530
It's not going to be $65.

2300
01:14:53,690 --> 01:14:54,410
Don't worry.

2301
01:14:54,430 --> 01:14:55,550
I think they learned from Concord.

2302
01:14:55,830 --> 01:14:57,010
Don't worry, I did.

2303
01:14:57,170 --> 01:15:01,590
I guess the real objective is to get those...

2304
01:15:01,590 --> 01:15:03,050
Oh my god, can I finally get a purse?

2305
01:15:03,970 --> 01:15:07,090
Once he got in the trailer, he put his head back to another frame.

2306
01:15:07,270 --> 01:15:09,110
Oh my god, he got a purse!

2307
01:15:09,110 --> 01:15:11,950
He put his head back to the lobby in general.

2308
01:15:14,090 --> 01:15:16,350
Unlocks additional things and gives you progress.

2309
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:18,070
It's generalizing progress, right?

2310
01:15:18,190 --> 01:15:21,370
You get cores in matches and then it progresses you outside of matches.

2311
01:15:21,390 --> 01:15:23,090
That way you can go back into matches stronger.

2312
01:15:23,570 --> 01:15:24,510
What the fuck?

2313
01:15:24,510 --> 01:15:24,770
Why?

2314
01:15:25,210 --> 01:15:26,010
It's not fair.

2315
01:15:26,050 --> 01:15:27,790
All the other people I played against had all of this.

2316
01:15:27,950 --> 01:15:30,670
When it comes to a victor in the match, right?

2317
01:15:31,070 --> 01:15:34,190
Is there an ideal victor?

2318
01:15:34,490 --> 01:15:36,210
Or if each team...

2319
01:15:36,210 --> 01:15:39,090
There's only three cores, right?

2320
01:15:40,510 --> 01:15:41,610
Yes, there's only three cores.

2321
01:15:41,610 --> 01:15:41,950
Custom weapons?

2322
01:15:42,630 --> 01:15:46,110
And then there's currently, we're playing with four teams of three.

2323
01:15:47,170 --> 01:15:47,650
Yes.

2324
01:15:48,070 --> 01:15:50,750
So if three of those teams all get one core...

2325
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:52,410
We're carrying keycard, it'll be used to be later.

2326
01:15:52,630 --> 01:15:53,050
Okay.

2327
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:55,470
I wanna be fast.

2328
01:15:56,050 --> 01:15:59,050
And then I wanna increase my melee damage.

2329
01:15:59,170 --> 01:15:59,730
What's my utility?

2330
01:16:00,190 --> 01:16:03,250
The way that the victory process works in here is two ways.

2331
01:16:03,250 --> 01:16:03,690
Oh, I have so many perks.

2332
01:16:03,910 --> 01:16:06,390
One, your objective is just so linear.

2333
01:16:06,390 --> 01:16:07,310
You get a biocore.

2334
01:16:07,310 --> 01:16:11,350
Even if you die and you still manage to extract a biocore at your home base.

2335
01:16:11,510 --> 01:16:12,950
And you die, like lose life completely.

2336
01:16:13,150 --> 01:16:14,030
I'll never die.

2337
01:16:14,390 --> 01:16:16,530
That is the overall premise of the game.

2338
01:16:16,550 --> 01:16:17,810
So I won't get the power insurance.

2339
01:16:18,230 --> 01:16:19,670
When it comes to the actual MVP...

2340
01:16:19,670 --> 01:16:23,150
When you have reached to swap it out or to add a custom weapon.

2341
01:16:23,470 --> 01:16:24,150
That's not fair.

2342
01:16:24,790 --> 01:16:25,230
Right.

2343
01:16:25,870 --> 01:16:27,810
The more kills you get, the more support you offer.

2344
01:16:27,810 --> 01:16:29,090
Okay, we're not gonna do sniper anymore.

2345
01:16:29,210 --> 01:16:30,210
Sniper fucking sucks.

2346
01:16:30,610 --> 01:16:32,350
I found out.

2347
01:16:32,910 --> 01:16:33,950
Okay, what's the...

2348
01:16:33,950 --> 01:16:36,230
So, it's not exactly...

2349
01:16:36,230 --> 01:16:38,370
There is benefit out of getting...

2350
01:16:38,370 --> 01:16:39,370
I'll get the shotgun first.

2351
01:16:39,450 --> 01:16:40,970
I feel like shotgun is like the best.

2352
01:16:40,970 --> 01:16:42,290
Which is getting all three biocores.

2353
01:16:42,390 --> 01:16:44,790
But if you get all three biocores, like that's just better for you.

2354
01:16:44,870 --> 01:16:46,210
All three of you now have...

2355
01:16:46,210 --> 01:16:46,850
All four...

2356
01:16:46,850 --> 01:16:48,870
All three of you now have three biocores.

2357
01:16:49,070 --> 01:16:50,390
Wait, what the fuck?

2358
01:16:50,890 --> 01:16:51,630
In this case, don't look at it...

2359
01:16:51,630 --> 01:16:53,270
Oh, this is when you get the biocore.

2360
01:16:53,270 --> 01:16:55,350
At like the same type of objective style based arena style shooter.

2361
01:16:56,170 --> 01:16:56,970
Everybody can...

2362
01:16:56,970 --> 01:17:00,330
Only one team can come out not successful.

2363
01:17:00,430 --> 01:17:01,030
And that's it.

2364
01:17:01,850 --> 01:17:02,250
Right.

2365
01:17:03,090 --> 01:17:03,490
Okay.

2366
01:17:03,770 --> 01:17:06,210
Because pretty much I was trying to differentiate...

2367
01:17:06,230 --> 01:17:07,130
What are we waiting for?

2368
01:17:07,550 --> 01:17:09,010
In the sense of...

2369
01:17:09,410 --> 01:17:11,110
Yeah, it feels like there is...

2370
01:17:11,110 --> 01:17:11,390
What is the...

2371
01:17:11,850 --> 01:17:14,730
There's so many times where I have to shotgun people.

2372
01:17:14,770 --> 01:17:15,870
Because we got a biocore.

2373
01:17:16,370 --> 01:17:19,890
And I think like two other teams had gotten like the other two.

2374
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:20,650
Demoman.

2375
01:17:20,850 --> 01:17:22,930
But I was like, if we got a biocore, then like...

2376
01:17:23,450 --> 01:17:23,850
Demoman.

2377
01:17:24,550 --> 01:17:25,590
Or is it like...

2378
01:17:25,590 --> 01:17:26,930
Oh, I can't shoot this in public.

2379
01:17:27,030 --> 01:17:28,230
But essentially, overall...

2380
01:17:28,230 --> 01:17:29,630
I have to shoot it in the fire range.

2381
01:17:30,450 --> 01:17:30,850
Casual.

2382
01:17:30,890 --> 01:17:33,210
You know, people who are more casual, right?

2383
01:17:33,670 --> 01:17:34,710
Came into play.

2384
01:17:34,930 --> 01:17:36,150
Is that they don't have to...

2385
01:17:36,150 --> 01:17:36,210
Oh, I can't shoot this in public.

2386
01:17:36,210 --> 01:17:38,310
We can have a biocore and have some stress about winning or loosing.

2387
01:17:38,430 --> 01:17:42,250
Because the only personal goal is to extract those biocores.

2388
01:17:42,430 --> 01:17:44,070
They can be completely passive...

2389
01:17:44,070 --> 01:17:46,810
And get biocores and then get completely dumped on, right?

2390
01:17:46,850 --> 01:17:47,490
They lose all of their lives.

2391
01:17:47,630 --> 01:17:49,330
This is crazy the amount of damage...

2392
01:17:49,330 --> 01:17:52,390
But as long as they got at least 1 biocore, then they can vibe out, play this game...

2393
01:17:52,390 --> 01:17:54,510
I can't tear that people in public.

2394
01:17:55,910 --> 01:17:56,350
Booo...

2395
01:17:58,190 --> 01:18:00,110
I want to play...

2396
01:18:00,110 --> 01:18:02,570
When it comes to the general battle for the biocore...

2397
01:18:02,570 --> 01:18:04,350
What if I just que up right now?

2398
01:18:04,670 --> 01:18:04,970
That's really cool.

2399
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:06,190
We got two players...

2400
01:18:06,210 --> 01:18:16,550
There's gonna be a very simple matchmaking process for this, so whenever the game launches, you press Q of A13 through SQM, and you'll have it in there as well.

2401
01:18:16,870 --> 01:18:18,790
But also, as far as the casualty...

2402
01:18:18,790 --> 01:18:19,230
Is there a left?

2403
01:18:19,330 --> 01:18:19,490
No.

2404
01:18:19,550 --> 01:18:21,550
Oh, there is, but I don't think it matters.

2405
01:18:21,930 --> 01:18:24,950
I don't think ADSing on the shotgun really matters.

2406
01:18:25,430 --> 01:18:31,270
The experience there is gonna be very similar, but in this case, it's still going to be...

2407
01:18:31,270 --> 01:18:34,830
Like, there's no power-up for ADSing.

2408
01:18:34,830 --> 01:18:36,230
Who's yapping?

2409
01:18:36,230 --> 01:18:37,750
A dev and a player.

2410
01:18:40,470 --> 01:18:42,390
You're learning about the game.

2411
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:43,950
Mid-range?

2412
01:18:44,090 --> 01:18:44,630
Mid-range?

2413
01:18:44,850 --> 01:18:46,270
Um, look at how far they are.

2414
01:18:47,570 --> 01:18:48,790
How do I get this?

2415
01:18:48,910 --> 01:18:49,670
Oh, there it is!

2416
01:18:50,770 --> 01:18:51,630
Toggle target?

2417
01:18:54,530 --> 01:18:56,430
Oh, how do I get them closer?

2418
01:18:56,870 --> 01:18:59,130
How do I get them closer?

2419
01:18:59,230 --> 01:19:03,630
Oh, there it is.

2420
01:19:05,130 --> 01:19:05,570
How do I get them closer?

2421
01:19:05,570 --> 01:19:05,570
Oh, there it is.

2422
01:19:05,570 --> 01:19:07,190
Right now, I'm just rambling, just as you do.

2423
01:19:07,290 --> 01:19:09,310
So now we're rambling each other.

2424
01:19:11,470 --> 01:19:14,050
Then I was thinking about how...

2425
01:19:14,050 --> 01:19:15,370
Wait, there's no power-up!

2426
01:19:15,510 --> 01:19:17,030
If we have time to talk afterwards then yeah.

2427
01:19:17,350 --> 01:19:17,790
Okay.

2428
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:19,170
There it is.

2429
01:19:19,450 --> 01:19:20,750
Wait, what the fuck?

2430
01:19:21,570 --> 01:19:22,310
That's crazy!

2431
01:19:27,490 --> 01:19:28,370
Wait, what?

2432
01:19:30,170 --> 01:19:30,850
Wait, what?

2433
01:19:30,910 --> 01:19:32,530
Wait, what?

2434
01:19:32,830 --> 01:19:34,610
Wait, what?

2435
01:19:39,350 --> 01:19:41,250
Oh, there's the end.

2436
01:19:44,350 --> 01:19:45,710
Oh, there it is.

2437
01:19:45,710 --> 01:19:45,930
Perfect.

2438
01:19:46,130 --> 01:19:46,470
There you go.

2439
01:19:47,930 --> 01:19:49,770
Guys, it wasn't me.

2440
01:19:53,010 --> 01:19:53,510
Me?

2441
01:19:58,230 --> 01:19:59,530
I can't promise.

2442
01:20:00,070 --> 01:20:01,430
I did get out of one.

2443
01:20:01,470 --> 01:20:03,530
How big are the aerial leaves for these?

2444
01:20:03,610 --> 01:20:04,510
I just...

2445
01:20:04,510 --> 01:20:04,590
I don't know.

2446
01:20:04,590 --> 01:20:05,770
She knew we do not have the end.

2447
01:20:05,830 --> 01:20:06,450
That's a clue.

2448
01:20:07,210 --> 01:20:08,850
I don't want to hear that question ever again in my life.

2449
01:20:08,850 --> 01:20:09,710
Guys, I didn't know!

2450
01:20:10,970 --> 01:20:14,170
I realized we were waiting for me in the end!

2451
01:20:14,170 --> 01:20:14,930
You said you got it twice.

2452
01:20:15,230 --> 01:20:16,910
I got it twice.

2453
01:20:16,950 --> 01:20:18,950
It's a horrible day to have yours.

2454
01:20:19,930 --> 01:20:21,670
It's a horrible day to have yours.

2455
01:20:21,670 --> 01:20:23,430
It's a horrible day to have yours.

2456
01:20:24,250 --> 01:20:26,390
It didn't show up in the corner!

2457
01:20:27,330 --> 01:20:28,230
It didn't!

2458
01:20:29,210 --> 01:20:31,430
Is everyone in the team searching for Matthew?

2459
01:20:31,470 --> 01:20:33,650
I was looking for him in the corner.

2460
01:20:34,590 --> 01:20:35,230
I know!

2461
01:20:35,650 --> 01:20:37,570
Everyone is searching for Matthew at the top of the screen.

2462
01:20:37,770 --> 01:20:38,170
Matthew...

2463
01:20:40,970 --> 01:20:41,770
Oh, okay.

2464
01:20:41,870 --> 01:20:42,070
Perfect.

2465
01:20:44,490 --> 01:20:44,890
Yeah!

2466
01:20:47,230 --> 01:20:47,710
Let's go.

2467
01:20:49,070 --> 01:20:50,390
Guys, look how he's dying!

2468
01:20:51,030 --> 01:20:51,990
It was me!

2469
01:20:52,210 --> 01:20:53,110
It was me!

2470
01:20:53,410 --> 01:20:57,690
Yeah, it will be a different team number, so just keep an eye on that bottom left and you'll know what team you need to be in.

2471
01:20:58,250 --> 01:21:01,730
Guys, I'm the little sister they brought along to the group hangout.

2472
01:21:02,030 --> 01:21:03,370
You can't blame me.

2473
01:21:05,810 --> 01:21:07,670
I don't know what's going on.

2474
01:21:07,810 --> 01:21:09,330
It was you all along.

2475
01:21:11,970 --> 01:21:13,590
Yeah, we filmed the hangout.

2476
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:15,730
Okay, I figured it out now.

2477
01:21:18,670 --> 01:21:21,110
I know what to do this time.

2478
01:21:21,350 --> 01:21:22,310
Look at my loadout!

2479
01:21:22,550 --> 01:21:24,170
Look at all that shit!

2480
01:21:24,730 --> 01:21:25,610
Look at that!

2481
01:21:26,530 --> 01:21:28,770
I know what I'm doing this time.

2482
01:21:28,910 --> 01:21:32,390
If you look at my loadout, you can tell I know what I'm doing.

2483
01:21:36,070 --> 01:21:38,250
Look at my crop top.

2484
01:21:38,430 --> 01:21:40,190
Thanks, I worked really hard for that.

2485
01:21:43,690 --> 01:21:44,130
Nice.

2486
01:21:44,450 --> 01:21:45,610
Ooh, I forgot.

2487
01:21:45,810 --> 01:21:48,010
I made a new weapon and I named it P. Diddy.

2488
01:21:49,030 --> 01:21:49,830
Oh gosh.

2489
01:21:51,330 --> 01:21:52,370
Is that just for me?

2490
01:21:54,630 --> 01:21:55,510
I hope not.

2491
01:21:56,390 --> 01:21:57,510
We should win now.

2492
01:21:57,830 --> 01:21:59,430
I have every perk of it.

2493
01:21:59,430 --> 01:21:59,810
I don't know.

2494
01:22:00,210 --> 01:22:02,010
We can't lose this time.

2495
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:03,070
They're with Winton.

2496
01:22:03,310 --> 01:22:04,130
Team 2.

2497
01:22:04,390 --> 01:22:04,750
Perfect.

2498
01:22:06,550 --> 01:22:07,730
Guys, we can do this.

2499
01:22:08,530 --> 01:22:10,510
I know how to play the game now.

2500
01:22:11,270 --> 01:22:11,750
Okay.

2501
01:22:12,730 --> 01:22:13,330
Harmony, huh?

2502
01:22:13,590 --> 01:22:14,630
Sounds like my time.

2503
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:16,990
Are you ready to win this time?

2504
01:22:17,090 --> 01:22:18,650
Yeah, I know how to play this time.

2505
01:22:18,710 --> 01:22:19,150
It's over.

2506
01:22:19,370 --> 01:22:20,390
Where are the snails?

2507
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:22,790
There's the snails hiding.

2508
01:22:23,690 --> 01:22:24,570
Oh, they're hiding?

2509
01:22:24,810 --> 01:22:25,750
Okay, I'm gonna go right side.

2510
01:22:27,550 --> 01:22:29,450
Okay, guys, I'm gonna find the snails, guys.

2511
01:22:30,110 --> 01:22:31,050
How's chat feeling about it?

2512
01:22:31,050 --> 01:22:31,330
Oh, see?

2513
01:22:31,430 --> 01:22:32,310
Look, I did it!

2514
01:22:32,390 --> 01:22:33,490
I found...

2515
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:37,490
Are they, like, bullying you to win?

2516
01:22:37,630 --> 01:22:39,330
They love the game.

2517
01:22:39,430 --> 01:22:40,030
Right, guys?

2518
01:22:40,090 --> 01:22:41,270
You guys love the game, right?

2519
01:22:43,530 --> 01:22:45,610
Guys, even if you don't like it, please lie.

2520
01:22:49,830 --> 01:22:51,750
Guys, even if you don't like it, please lie.

2521
01:22:51,810 --> 01:22:52,810
I need this spot.

2522
01:22:53,030 --> 01:22:53,750
No, I'm joking.

2523
01:22:59,090 --> 01:23:00,510
Where are these snails from?

2524
01:23:01,110 --> 01:23:01,210
Where are these snails from?

2525
01:23:01,210 --> 01:23:01,370
Where are these snails from?

2526
01:23:02,070 --> 01:23:02,850
I found one.

2527
01:23:02,930 --> 01:23:03,670
I found one.

2528
01:23:07,470 --> 01:23:08,790
Froggy and I were talking about it.

2529
01:23:08,830 --> 01:23:13,870
We noticed that, like, if you kind of just circle around, the snail will spawn back where you are.

2530
01:23:14,370 --> 01:23:14,690
Whoa, what the fuck is that?

2531
01:23:14,690 --> 01:23:15,670
Whoa, what the fuck is that?

2532
01:23:16,810 --> 01:23:17,950
Oh my god, you can...

2533
01:23:18,730 --> 01:23:21,110
Walk up and press E, you can ride them.

2534
01:23:21,630 --> 01:23:23,410
Wait, we can ride them by shot?

2535
01:23:23,410 --> 01:23:24,990
Yeah, no, no, just walk up.

2536
01:23:25,050 --> 01:23:25,730
Just walk up and press E.

2537
01:23:25,750 --> 01:23:26,750
But I shot him.

2538
01:23:26,890 --> 01:23:27,710
I pressed E.

2539
01:23:27,770 --> 01:23:28,770
I don't think he likes me.

2540
01:23:29,210 --> 01:23:30,810
Trust me, I'd never lead you astray.

2541
01:23:30,850 --> 01:23:33,090
Okay, but he hit me and now I lost HP.

2542
01:23:33,530 --> 01:23:34,450
So, I'm leaving.

2543
01:23:36,170 --> 01:23:37,250
Wait, do I kill him?

2544
01:23:37,790 --> 01:23:38,670
Yeah, you kill him.

2545
01:23:39,430 --> 01:23:40,170
I killed you?

2546
01:23:41,990 --> 01:23:42,430
Okay.

2547
01:23:42,430 --> 01:23:42,870
Nice.

2548
01:23:43,510 --> 01:23:44,450
Alright, alright, alright.

2549
01:23:44,790 --> 01:23:47,230
You just shit?

2550
01:23:48,470 --> 01:23:48,910
Nice.

2551
01:23:50,430 --> 01:23:51,570
Wait, I need tears.

2552
01:23:52,270 --> 01:23:55,910
Wait, I have, like, this F key, what is that?

2553
01:23:56,090 --> 01:23:56,850
What am I holding?

2554
01:23:57,530 --> 01:23:58,930
That's gonna be your utility key.

2555
01:23:59,110 --> 01:24:00,850
So you'll be able to use things like traps.

2556
01:24:00,950 --> 01:24:02,070
Oh, I have a tracker, Glen!

2557
01:24:02,990 --> 01:24:05,050
Yeah, so, like, you throw it, and it's remote.

2558
01:24:05,190 --> 01:24:07,570
It's not remote detonation, it's movement detonation.

2559
01:24:07,670 --> 01:24:12,450
So, like, you throw it, and if somebody walks past it, they're going to be highlighted for you.

2560
01:24:12,830 --> 01:24:13,710
Oh, I see.

2561
01:24:15,170 --> 01:24:16,430
Get out of here, snail.

2562
01:24:18,890 --> 01:24:19,790
That's fucking right.

2563
01:24:19,790 --> 01:24:20,230
Alright, cool.

2564
01:24:20,250 --> 01:24:25,890
We have a lot of power, so I think we're good to go to A and scan for the next biocore here.

2565
01:24:28,970 --> 01:24:30,290
Guys, type in my...

2566
01:24:30,290 --> 01:24:34,750
Guys, after the stream, type in my comment section and be like, game of the year.

2567
01:24:42,730 --> 01:24:46,670
And then be like, Jedi is my favorite dev.

2568
01:24:49,790 --> 01:24:51,330
In the comments.

2569
01:24:53,410 --> 01:24:57,170
And be like, Jedi is my favorite developer.

2570
01:25:00,710 --> 01:25:06,530
Alright, I actually think it would be better if we put our power here.

2571
01:25:07,570 --> 01:25:08,210
Shields.

2572
01:25:10,250 --> 01:25:11,810
There we go.

2573
01:25:13,370 --> 01:25:17,330
We can go take a peek at the shop.

2574
01:25:17,330 --> 01:25:18,350
What is this?

2575
01:25:18,470 --> 01:25:19,090
Take item?

2576
01:25:19,970 --> 01:25:20,630
Yeah, yeah.

2577
01:25:21,490 --> 01:25:26,310
So you know how the first game we walked up to that shop Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2578
01:25:26,870 --> 01:25:30,070
You can actually buy shields from your respawn base.

2579
01:25:30,410 --> 01:25:31,830
Oh, I see.

2580
01:25:32,310 --> 01:25:34,350
It costs just a little bit more.

2581
01:25:34,510 --> 01:25:35,730
It costs 100 more power.

2582
01:25:35,930 --> 01:25:36,630
Oh, I see.

2583
01:25:38,370 --> 01:25:40,470
I'm going to put my shotgun out just in case, guys.

2584
01:25:40,590 --> 01:25:42,030
I have no more power, but we do have 200.

2585
01:25:42,450 --> 01:25:43,930
Wait, I didn't deposit my power.

2586
01:25:44,810 --> 01:25:46,410
I've added power to the team bank.

2587
01:25:47,590 --> 01:25:48,550
I put some.

2588
01:25:49,950 --> 01:25:52,010
There's a score creeper.

2589
01:25:52,390 --> 01:25:55,290
Try to buy this score creeper.

2590
01:25:56,070 --> 01:25:57,030
Score creeper.

2591
01:25:57,490 --> 01:25:58,590
I'm buying it.

2592
01:25:58,730 --> 01:25:59,930
Got me a sweet battle rifle.

2593
01:26:00,090 --> 01:26:00,690
Totally rad.

2594
01:26:02,510 --> 01:26:03,490
Beam glove secured.

2595
01:26:04,510 --> 01:26:06,110
I just want to poke around a little bit.

2596
01:26:06,230 --> 01:26:07,030
There's usually some pretty...

2597
01:26:07,030 --> 01:26:07,990
Oh my god, look at this.

2598
01:26:08,130 --> 01:26:09,590
You can have this.

2599
01:26:09,730 --> 01:26:10,290
Get over here.

2600
01:26:11,550 --> 01:26:12,790
Pick one up.

2601
01:26:12,850 --> 01:26:14,450
Pick up the shiny.

2602
01:26:14,690 --> 01:26:15,530
There's a shiny?

2603
01:26:16,010 --> 01:26:16,730
There's a shiny.

2604
01:26:16,910 --> 01:26:19,030
Oh, it's tier 4!

2605
01:26:19,770 --> 01:26:20,870
I'll never die.

2606
01:26:23,990 --> 01:26:25,450
Guys, I'm being fed so much.

2607
01:26:25,750 --> 01:26:25,910
What the hell is that?

2608
01:26:26,550 --> 01:26:27,910
These are shield repairs.

2609
01:26:28,530 --> 01:26:29,250
Wait, what?

2610
01:26:29,510 --> 01:26:31,130
Here, here, here.

2611
01:26:32,490 --> 01:26:34,550
This right here on the ground is a shield repair.

2612
01:26:34,830 --> 01:26:35,530
Use your...

2613
01:26:37,050 --> 01:26:37,950
Apex brain it.

2614
01:26:37,970 --> 01:26:38,970
Use 4k to heal.

2615
01:26:39,430 --> 01:26:40,890
Oh, I see, I see.

2616
01:26:41,150 --> 01:26:42,370
Wait, I hear gunshots outside.

2617
01:26:43,270 --> 01:26:44,130
Yeah, I do too.

2618
01:26:44,330 --> 01:26:45,170
I don't want to look at it yet.

2619
01:26:45,530 --> 01:26:47,490
I want to do just a little bit more...

2620
01:26:47,490 --> 01:26:48,070
Looting.

2621
01:26:48,070 --> 01:26:48,590
On me, on me!

2622
01:26:53,690 --> 01:26:54,090
Okay.

2623
01:26:55,570 --> 01:26:56,270
Oh, I passed.

2624
01:26:56,470 --> 01:26:57,450
Oh no, I'm getting healed.

2625
01:26:57,550 --> 01:26:58,230
By the aura.

2626
01:26:59,870 --> 01:27:01,090
I'm grabbing the shotgun.

2627
01:27:01,170 --> 01:27:03,130
I feel like the shotgun is better, chat.

2628
01:27:03,670 --> 01:27:05,590
I don't know, the rifle feels so...

2629
01:27:05,590 --> 01:27:08,270
Not rifle, but like...

2630
01:27:09,070 --> 01:27:09,470
Broke.

2631
01:27:10,290 --> 01:27:11,530
It's like 33...

2632
01:27:11,530 --> 01:27:12,510
I hit 33.

2633
01:27:13,370 --> 01:27:14,130
On me, on me!

2634
01:27:15,050 --> 01:27:15,550
On me!

2635
01:27:18,050 --> 01:27:18,970
Oh, I got it down?

2636
01:27:19,390 --> 01:27:21,050
What the fuck happened there?

2637
01:27:24,050 --> 01:27:24,690
Oh, no.

2638
01:27:26,250 --> 01:27:27,250
Alright, I'm gonna push here.

2639
01:27:27,350 --> 01:27:27,990
They have one down.

2640
01:27:28,070 --> 01:27:28,610
There's only two of them.

2641
01:27:28,730 --> 01:27:28,990
Oh, okay.

2642
01:27:29,090 --> 01:27:29,870
Oh, dude, he's dead.

2643
01:27:30,070 --> 01:27:30,890
Dude, I killed Iceman.

2644
01:27:30,950 --> 01:27:31,230
That was sick.

2645
01:27:34,210 --> 01:27:34,930
28 flesh.

2646
01:27:35,950 --> 01:27:36,490
Here's one!

2647
01:27:37,210 --> 01:27:38,070
I'm gonna chop him behind.

2648
01:27:39,530 --> 01:27:40,570
Oh, he's right here, right here.

2649
01:27:40,710 --> 01:27:40,990
Yeah.

2650
01:27:41,530 --> 01:27:42,650
Wait, is there friendly fire?

2651
01:27:48,830 --> 01:27:49,270
Nice.

2652
01:27:50,090 --> 01:27:51,030
Oh, yoink.

2653
01:27:52,510 --> 01:27:53,190
That's the mob.

2654
01:27:53,890 --> 01:27:55,410
Is this a better shotgun?

2655
01:27:55,750 --> 01:27:57,050
Oh, it is!

2656
01:27:57,170 --> 01:27:57,390
Okay.

2657
01:27:59,070 --> 01:28:00,610
Oh, there's people coming into the shop.

2658
01:28:00,790 --> 01:28:01,750
Oh, okay.

2659
01:28:02,290 --> 01:28:04,110
I'm like, I need some shields.

2660
01:28:05,070 --> 01:28:07,150
Have you got any energy ammo?

2661
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:07,590
Yeah, yeah, I got some here.

2662
01:28:08,890 --> 01:28:10,270
Here, Doki, I'm gonna drop some shields for you.

2663
01:28:10,370 --> 01:28:11,690
Uh, I have...

2664
01:28:11,690 --> 01:28:12,530
Oh, nice.

2665
01:28:12,750 --> 01:28:13,110
Okay.

2666
01:28:14,690 --> 01:28:15,470
I have some energy.

2667
01:28:15,870 --> 01:28:16,550
You said you need ammo here.

2668
01:28:18,730 --> 01:28:19,450
Sure thing.

2669
01:28:19,710 --> 01:28:20,350
Let's do it.

2670
01:28:24,350 --> 01:28:28,190
Alright, now with these beam gloves, you can also do this little AOE right here, so you can get in the bubble.

2671
01:28:28,390 --> 01:28:29,950
And also, she can heal you.

2672
01:28:30,110 --> 01:28:30,330
Oh, okay.

2673
01:28:31,030 --> 01:28:34,630
It doesn't heal as good as, like, a lock-on heal, but, you know, it's...

2674
01:28:34,630 --> 01:28:35,410
But it's just AOE.

2675
01:28:35,470 --> 01:28:36,430
Yeah, it's just AOE.

2676
01:28:36,430 --> 01:28:37,750
Oh, above me, above me.

2677
01:28:41,570 --> 01:28:43,170
Oh, there's so many people!

2678
01:28:44,690 --> 01:28:45,570
I don't see shit!

2679
01:28:45,850 --> 01:28:46,710
I don't see shit!

2680
01:28:46,870 --> 01:28:46,890
I don't see shit!

2681
01:28:47,450 --> 01:28:48,530
They're all up up there.

2682
01:28:48,550 --> 01:28:49,870
What do you mean they're there?

2683
01:28:50,430 --> 01:28:53,050
Oh, frag grenade.

2684
01:28:53,330 --> 01:28:54,090
That's my nade.

2685
01:28:54,630 --> 01:28:56,410
Okay, I'm backing out a little bit.

2686
01:28:56,730 --> 01:28:57,970
Oh my god, I'm so fucked.

2687
01:28:58,090 --> 01:28:58,290
I'm so fucked.

2688
01:28:59,350 --> 01:28:59,750
Ah!

2689
01:29:00,070 --> 01:29:00,930
Right here in front of me!

2690
01:29:03,570 --> 01:29:03,970
Down.

2691
01:29:03,970 --> 01:29:04,950
I'm backing out a little.

2692
01:29:05,270 --> 01:29:06,050
Oh, I'm gonna die.

2693
01:29:08,890 --> 01:29:09,890
Oh, got it.

2694
01:29:09,910 --> 01:29:10,150
Me too.

2695
01:29:10,730 --> 01:29:11,530
Ah, no!

2696
01:29:11,710 --> 01:29:12,750
He headshot me!

2697
01:29:13,290 --> 01:29:13,770
No!

2698
01:29:15,570 --> 01:29:17,270
I was trying to shoot you, Ico.

2699
01:29:17,450 --> 01:29:18,390
Oh my god.

2700
01:29:18,490 --> 01:29:19,790
Is it friendly fire?

2701
01:29:20,030 --> 01:29:21,010
I thought no.

2702
01:29:21,270 --> 01:29:23,050
I just thought she was a bad person.

2703
01:29:23,150 --> 01:29:23,550
It's okay.

2704
01:29:23,730 --> 01:29:24,330
I'm alive.

2705
01:29:24,650 --> 01:29:26,530
But, like, at what cost?

2706
01:29:28,030 --> 01:29:28,510
Help.

2707
01:29:29,070 --> 01:29:31,490
They had gold shields too, bro.

2708
01:29:31,690 --> 01:29:32,770
They had gold shields.

2709
01:29:32,810 --> 01:29:33,530
Okay, that's not fair.

2710
01:29:33,590 --> 01:29:34,410
I'm just gonna die here.

2711
01:29:35,830 --> 01:29:36,930
Get that shotgun.

2712
01:29:36,930 --> 01:29:37,190
Come on.

2713
01:29:39,970 --> 01:29:42,370
It takes so long to reload the shotgun.

2714
01:29:42,870 --> 01:29:43,570
I noticed.

2715
01:29:45,310 --> 01:29:45,970
Yeah, chat.

2716
01:29:46,110 --> 01:29:47,050
It takes so long.

2717
01:29:47,350 --> 01:29:48,150
I'm not ready.

2718
01:29:48,250 --> 01:29:50,430
Like, I shot one bullet, and I was like, reload.

2719
01:29:50,790 --> 01:29:52,450
I was like, why did I do that?

2720
01:29:53,970 --> 01:29:55,450
And this whip?

2721
01:29:55,830 --> 01:29:57,490
Yeah, teammates can block shots.

2722
01:29:57,690 --> 01:30:00,250
The Mustang that I'm driving, it's fully customizable too.

2723
01:30:01,370 --> 01:30:02,990
You can, like, make it look cool as shit.

2724
01:30:04,410 --> 01:30:07,830
So when you pull up the Shorty's house, you can be like, Hey, what's up, baby mama?

2725
01:30:08,090 --> 01:30:09,090
What the fuck?

2726
01:30:11,230 --> 01:30:13,830
He's stuck in the 80s right now.

2727
01:30:13,970 --> 01:30:15,270
I don't think he knows it's 2024.

2728
01:30:16,270 --> 01:30:17,850
By the way, this dev's awesome.

2729
01:30:18,010 --> 01:30:19,930
I'm really gonna comment that on the VOD.

2730
01:30:20,090 --> 01:30:20,490
Are we gonna make it?

2731
01:30:21,390 --> 01:30:22,930
I don't keep up for a big fight.

2732
01:30:27,090 --> 01:30:27,930
Oh, shit.

2733
01:30:29,890 --> 01:30:30,550
He's down.

2734
01:30:31,010 --> 01:30:32,110
I need heals, though.

2735
01:30:32,150 --> 01:30:32,930
I'm fucking low.

2736
01:30:33,210 --> 01:30:33,630
Oh, next one.

2737
01:30:33,790 --> 01:30:34,210
Yeah.

2738
01:30:36,930 --> 01:30:37,250
I got you.

2739
01:30:37,770 --> 01:30:38,810
Give me my shield.

2740
01:30:39,810 --> 01:30:43,250
Dude, no way they actually got that off.

2741
01:30:44,310 --> 01:30:44,710
Unlucky.

2742
01:30:45,250 --> 01:30:45,930
We were right down.

2743
01:30:48,370 --> 01:30:49,670
One's super weak right now.

2744
01:30:49,950 --> 01:30:53,310
He is?

2745
01:30:57,090 --> 01:30:57,850
Oh, he's dead.

2746
01:30:57,970 --> 01:30:58,150
Okay.

2747
01:30:58,950 --> 01:30:59,970
There's another squad right here.

2748
01:30:59,970 --> 01:31:01,230
Killed by a girl.

2749
01:31:01,390 --> 01:31:02,330
So embarrassing.

2750
01:31:03,630 --> 01:31:05,070
I'm behind you, Jay.

2751
01:31:05,290 --> 01:31:07,330
No, I don't want that.

2752
01:31:07,790 --> 01:31:09,170
Give me my gun.

2753
01:31:10,050 --> 01:31:11,130
Gotta reload.

2754
01:31:11,430 --> 01:31:12,230
Cover me, dudes.

2755
01:31:13,690 --> 01:31:15,170
Wait, what?

2756
01:31:15,270 --> 01:31:15,670
What happened?

2757
01:31:15,910 --> 01:31:16,510
Oh, it's an airstrike.

2758
01:31:16,910 --> 01:31:18,270
What the fuck?

2759
01:31:18,370 --> 01:31:19,710
There's airstrikes?

2760
01:31:21,170 --> 01:31:22,170
Okay, I'm okay.

2761
01:31:23,130 --> 01:31:23,950
Where are you?

2762
01:31:23,990 --> 01:31:24,490
He's dead.

2763
01:31:25,030 --> 01:31:27,610
I got literally deleted by Thanos.

2764
01:31:27,610 --> 01:31:29,590
Wait, how is there an airstrike?

2765
01:31:30,610 --> 01:31:33,130
So, uh, you remember that EMP I was talking about last game?

2766
01:31:33,270 --> 01:31:33,510
Yeah.

2767
01:31:34,630 --> 01:31:38,290
The airstrike is also like a manually triggered event.

2768
01:31:38,850 --> 01:31:39,210
Oh!

2769
01:31:41,570 --> 01:31:41,930
Okay.

2770
01:31:42,710 --> 01:31:45,790
Whenever you start the match, you'll be able to see where it's at on the map.

2771
01:31:46,010 --> 01:31:46,910
And you just go straight.

2772
01:31:46,990 --> 01:31:48,690
You can go straight towards it, just fire it right off.

2773
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:50,150
Oh, I see.

2774
01:31:51,170 --> 01:31:51,670
That's fun.

2775
01:31:51,790 --> 01:31:53,570
And we have a lot more.

2776
01:31:53,790 --> 01:31:55,370
So we've got stuff like lightning strikes.

2777
01:31:55,370 --> 01:31:57,730
We've also got toxic chambers.

2778
01:31:58,730 --> 01:32:00,290
Right now, we're on the top ground.

2779
01:32:00,410 --> 01:32:01,330
We haven't gone underground yet.

2780
01:32:01,410 --> 01:32:04,110
We have a full underground area of the map as well.

2781
01:32:04,190 --> 01:32:04,530
And it's huge.

2782
01:32:05,050 --> 01:32:05,410
Okay.

2783
01:32:05,810 --> 01:32:08,450
You can flood it with toxic gas to force people out.

2784
01:32:08,970 --> 01:32:10,670
Also, we have this one thing.

2785
01:32:10,810 --> 01:32:11,710
You can see everybody on the map.

2786
01:32:11,730 --> 01:32:12,090
It's kind of cool.

2787
01:32:12,750 --> 01:32:13,630
Give me my shield.

2788
01:32:13,770 --> 01:32:14,530
Give me my shield.

2789
01:32:14,710 --> 01:32:16,290
That's one last catamon in the forest.

2790
01:32:16,570 --> 01:32:18,270
Some of them require a little bit of work.

2791
01:32:18,390 --> 01:32:20,630
Some of them are pretty easy to just activate.

2792
01:32:21,410 --> 01:32:22,510
Oh, I see.

2793
01:32:22,630 --> 01:32:24,090
So they just activate it.

2794
01:32:24,090 --> 01:32:26,310
But why would they activate it on us?

2795
01:32:28,450 --> 01:32:29,970
It depends on what it is.

2796
01:32:30,070 --> 01:32:33,030
So like, for example, the airstrike tower, right?

2797
01:32:33,410 --> 01:32:34,010
It's obvious.

2798
01:32:34,130 --> 01:32:38,850
You want to drop an airstrike on where there's a lot of people so that way you can get as many kills as possible and deal as much damage.

2799
01:32:39,010 --> 01:32:39,950
Oh, I see.

2800
01:32:40,110 --> 01:32:41,790
So they just wanted the kills.

2801
01:32:42,310 --> 01:32:42,850
Yeah, yeah.

2802
01:32:42,910 --> 01:32:44,250
And it really depends.

2803
01:32:44,390 --> 01:32:45,490
It's situational, right?

2804
01:32:45,650 --> 01:32:54,150
How do you use the event to your tactical advantage to secure a biocore or just create friction in any kind of firefight?

2805
01:32:54,430 --> 01:32:55,590
If you want to be a troll, you can.

2806
01:32:55,790 --> 01:32:57,510
But everybody knows where you're at.

2807
01:32:57,910 --> 01:32:59,430
Everybody knows where you're at when you're doing it.

2808
01:32:59,850 --> 01:33:02,030
It's okay, I don't because I wasn't paying attention.

2809
01:33:03,390 --> 01:33:05,350
I'm not gonna lie, I wasn't paying attention either.

2810
01:33:06,830 --> 01:33:08,030
Oh, we need fire.

2811
01:33:09,330 --> 01:33:11,450
What the fuck is this gun recoil?

2812
01:33:11,850 --> 01:33:12,730
What the fuck is this gun recoil?

2813
01:33:12,730 --> 01:33:13,650
There's people in front of me?

2814
01:33:16,190 --> 01:33:17,310
Sniper on the prowl.

2815
01:33:17,310 --> 01:33:18,850
Trying to ruin my totally bitchin' day.

2816
01:33:18,930 --> 01:33:19,630
Oh, there's a sniper somewhere.

2817
01:33:19,630 --> 01:33:23,850
Bro, the hipfire for this gun is like weird too, guys.

2818
01:33:24,370 --> 01:33:25,190
I would admit.

2819
01:33:28,510 --> 01:33:29,690
We can rush him, we can rush him.

2820
01:33:29,730 --> 01:33:30,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2821
01:33:30,490 --> 01:33:31,670
There's two teams though.

2822
01:33:32,090 --> 01:33:32,850
What was that, two?

2823
01:33:33,130 --> 01:33:34,390
Yeah, yeah, there's two teams fighting.

2824
01:33:35,730 --> 01:33:36,750
You know what we can do?

2825
01:33:36,910 --> 01:33:38,150
We can try and do the airstrike.

2826
01:33:38,210 --> 01:33:39,010
The airstrike's reloaded.

2827
01:33:39,190 --> 01:33:40,570
Yeah, yeah, let's go to the airstrike.

2828
01:33:40,670 --> 01:33:42,430
Let's go light people on fire.

2829
01:33:42,910 --> 01:33:45,510
I got two knocks though on me.

2830
01:33:45,910 --> 01:33:46,590
He's shredding.

2831
01:33:47,450 --> 01:33:49,330
Biocore B is 50% complete.

2832
01:33:50,190 --> 01:33:51,770
Melee them so you can get your shield back too.

2833
01:33:56,370 --> 01:33:57,010
Melee them.

2834
01:33:57,930 --> 01:33:58,410
Yeah.

2835
01:33:58,990 --> 01:33:59,750
Okay, nice.

2836
01:34:01,990 --> 01:34:03,730
I can hit people on me.

2837
01:34:04,610 --> 01:34:05,090
Okay.

2838
01:34:05,270 --> 01:34:05,970
Oh, there's one right here.

2839
01:34:08,230 --> 01:34:09,130
Right below you right now.

2840
01:34:09,130 --> 01:34:10,750
Right below you right now.

2841
01:34:11,510 --> 01:34:12,910
What gun do I have?

2842
01:34:13,590 --> 01:34:14,070
No visuals.

2843
01:34:15,050 --> 01:34:16,770
I hear people behind me.

2844
01:34:17,330 --> 01:34:18,470
There's one behind you.

2845
01:34:18,470 --> 01:34:19,510
I'm over here.

2846
01:34:20,090 --> 01:34:21,350
Okay, we can't shoot through that.

2847
01:34:21,570 --> 01:34:22,850
Should we get the biocore?

2848
01:34:24,410 --> 01:34:25,350
We can.

2849
01:34:25,450 --> 01:34:27,210
Let's go through this window up here.

2850
01:34:27,590 --> 01:34:28,070
Ooh.

2851
01:34:30,710 --> 01:34:32,030
Sniper douchebag on you, my dudes.

2852
01:34:32,030 --> 01:34:32,670
There's a sniper somewhere.

2853
01:34:33,230 --> 01:34:34,770
Damn chump trying to pin me down.

2854
01:34:35,830 --> 01:34:37,150
I broke somebody in here.

2855
01:34:37,310 --> 01:34:37,790
Oh, on you?

2856
01:34:39,650 --> 01:34:40,730
Oh my god.

2857
01:34:41,010 --> 01:34:43,910
This is like a full... what?

2858
01:34:45,270 --> 01:34:45,890
Whoa.

2859
01:34:46,370 --> 01:34:46,990
Yeah.

2860
01:34:48,330 --> 01:34:49,450
Insta headshot.

2861
01:34:50,550 --> 01:34:51,170
Bitch.

2862
01:34:52,370 --> 01:34:53,410
Oh my god.

2863
01:34:53,550 --> 01:34:53,770
Okay.

2864
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:57,690
Oh, I got insta headshot.

2865
01:34:58,270 --> 01:34:59,090
What's that?

2866
01:34:59,170 --> 01:35:00,630
Why can't I do that damage?

2867
01:35:03,130 --> 01:35:04,730
I want that guy's gun.

2868
01:35:05,030 --> 01:35:07,430
I want that guy's fucking gun.

2869
01:35:08,090 --> 01:35:09,690
What gun is that?

2870
01:35:10,110 --> 01:35:11,250
What the fuck?

2871
01:35:11,660 --> 01:35:13,830
Why can't I see what gun killed me?

2872
01:35:13,910 --> 01:35:15,350
I just see killed by Iceman.

2873
01:35:15,550 --> 01:35:16,870
What kind of gun was that?

2874
01:35:17,810 --> 01:35:18,250
Okay.

2875
01:35:18,550 --> 01:35:23,050
Well, we can't play for C since we know B is a little bit of a pain in the ass to go grab.

2876
01:35:23,450 --> 01:35:24,570
Biocore rescue underway.

2877
01:35:25,150 --> 01:35:26,650
I have some power too.

2878
01:35:26,750 --> 01:35:28,690
This is more kind of adventure.

2879
01:35:28,970 --> 01:35:29,690
What's the point?

2880
01:35:29,950 --> 01:35:31,010
You know what?

2881
01:35:31,030 --> 01:35:31,770
Maybe sniper is good.

2882
01:35:31,830 --> 01:35:34,490
Whatever sniper that guy has, bro, fuck that guy.

2883
01:35:34,750 --> 01:35:35,930
I want that guy's gun.

2884
01:35:37,210 --> 01:35:39,450
I've added some juice to the team bank.

2885
01:35:39,650 --> 01:35:40,590
Oh, I don't have any.

2886
01:35:41,150 --> 01:35:41,810
Alright, here.

2887
01:35:41,990 --> 01:35:43,070
I'm gonna give you something cool.

2888
01:35:43,910 --> 01:35:44,070
Okay.

2889
01:35:44,070 --> 01:35:44,690
What is it?

2890
01:35:44,950 --> 01:35:46,210
I'm gonna give you P Diddy.

2891
01:35:46,750 --> 01:35:47,570
What is that?

2892
01:35:47,990 --> 01:35:49,070
A custom weapon.

2893
01:35:49,290 --> 01:35:52,830
This is my cheat code to you.

2894
01:35:52,950 --> 01:35:54,910
Is this a sniper?

2895
01:35:55,330 --> 01:35:56,250
This is a sniper.

2896
01:35:56,430 --> 01:35:57,650
It's a very special sniper.

2897
01:35:59,210 --> 01:36:06,130
It should have a faster ADS and it should also heal you whenever you hit them.

2898
01:36:06,130 --> 01:36:07,270
Oh, if I hit the shot?

2899
01:36:07,570 --> 01:36:08,750
Okay, let's go to C.

2900
01:36:08,930 --> 01:36:11,010
It should do like 5% shield repair.

2901
01:36:11,830 --> 01:36:12,630
Oh, shit.

2902
01:36:12,790 --> 01:36:13,830
Okay, I'm heading up.

2903
01:36:16,230 --> 01:36:17,090
Okay, you guys go.

2904
01:36:17,150 --> 01:36:17,930
I'm just gonna snipe.

2905
01:36:20,170 --> 01:36:20,570
Wait.

2906
01:36:20,670 --> 01:36:21,730
Should we go to B?

2907
01:36:22,390 --> 01:36:23,570
I would say go to C.

2908
01:36:23,970 --> 01:36:25,050
C is really close.

2909
01:36:25,170 --> 01:36:26,950
We're literally right next to it.

2910
01:36:28,370 --> 01:36:29,770
I see people next to me.

2911
01:36:30,110 --> 01:36:30,850
There's a heart in here.

2912
01:36:32,710 --> 01:36:33,110
Oh!

2913
01:36:33,890 --> 01:36:34,290
Okay.

2914
01:36:40,780 --> 01:36:41,920
Bro, stop ADSing.

2915
01:36:43,020 --> 01:36:43,760
Yes, okay.

2916
01:36:45,540 --> 01:36:48,560
They're over here fighting right now and I'm...

2917
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:50,000
I knocked somebody.

2918
01:36:50,860 --> 01:36:51,580
Yeah, dude.

2919
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:53,140
They're still over there.

2920
01:36:53,180 --> 01:36:54,780
We wanna do anything about it.

2921
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:58,120
Oh, there's a purple shield down here.

2922
01:36:58,160 --> 01:36:58,800
Do you wanna...

2923
01:36:59,900 --> 01:37:00,940
Bring it up.

2924
01:37:01,340 --> 01:37:01,920
Taxi it.

2925
01:37:02,620 --> 01:37:03,340
Taxi it?

2926
01:37:03,380 --> 01:37:04,440
Yeah, taxi it.

2927
01:37:08,220 --> 01:37:08,900
He's dead.

2928
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:11,460
Alright, where are you?

2929
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:12,380
I'm up top.

2930
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:17,840
I actually like...

2931
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:20,740
I think I'm gonna ban everybody who uses the Spore Creeper, dude.

2932
01:37:22,060 --> 01:37:23,980
I cracked him several times.

2933
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:25,500
Stop it.

2934
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:29,500
The bio-gat thing is right over here next to us.

2935
01:37:29,560 --> 01:37:30,640
Let's go grab it.

2936
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:32,180
I cover.

2937
01:37:32,300 --> 01:37:32,720
I can cover.

2938
01:37:37,020 --> 01:37:38,100
Oh, there's a team in here.

2939
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:39,660
Oh, he's one!

2940
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:40,560
He's one!

2941
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:44,040
Behind you!

2942
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:44,380
Behind you!

2943
01:37:46,860 --> 01:37:47,660
Oh, dude!

2944
01:37:47,700 --> 01:37:49,320
I got fucking deleted.

2945
01:37:49,660 --> 01:37:50,540
Wait, can you rez him?

2946
01:37:50,720 --> 01:37:51,280
I can cover.

2947
01:37:51,900 --> 01:37:53,460
Yeah, I should be relatively safe.

2948
01:37:53,460 --> 01:37:54,200
You're rez-able.

2949
01:37:54,380 --> 01:37:56,120
Yeah, they're not looking at you.

2950
01:38:00,940 --> 01:38:01,740
The EMP'd.

2951
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:04,560
They're looking at me, so...

2952
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:06,700
Okay.

2953
01:38:07,300 --> 01:38:08,180
I downed him.

2954
01:38:08,900 --> 01:38:09,300
Nice!

2955
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:13,880
Hey, I think I like this gun, guys.

2956
01:38:14,100 --> 01:38:15,200
I think...

2957
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:18,180
Boom, baby!

2958
01:38:18,780 --> 01:38:19,420
Oh, nice!

2959
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:19,980
I got a kill!

2960
01:38:20,700 --> 01:38:21,940
Oh, there's people in this room on me.

2961
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:24,860
He is right next to us right now.

2962
01:38:25,880 --> 01:38:26,500
Right here.

2963
01:38:27,780 --> 01:38:28,320
He's coming up.

2964
01:38:28,780 --> 01:38:30,740
Wait, where are you guys?

2965
01:38:31,480 --> 01:38:31,840
Broke.

2966
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:32,140
Broke.

2967
01:38:32,180 --> 01:38:32,360
Broke.

2968
01:38:32,360 --> 01:38:32,480
Broke.

2969
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:32,520
Broke.

2970
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:34,720
I don't even know how to get to you guys.

2971
01:38:38,160 --> 01:38:38,980
Should we go to...

2972
01:38:38,980 --> 01:38:40,640
Oh, above me.

2973
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:41,060
Above me.

2974
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:42,760
On the roof.

2975
01:38:42,860 --> 01:38:43,140
On the roof.

2976
01:38:43,640 --> 01:38:44,040
Coming.

2977
01:38:44,440 --> 01:38:45,440
I don't know where he went.

2978
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:49,100
He's literally there with me.

2979
01:38:50,380 --> 01:38:52,380
Because I don't want to lose my sniper, guys.

2980
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:53,480
Because I don't want to lose my sniper, guys.

2981
01:38:53,480 --> 01:38:56,240
So, if you die, I can get it back.

2982
01:38:56,500 --> 01:38:56,940
Oh, okay.

2983
01:38:57,540 --> 01:38:58,520
Can we go to B?

2984
01:38:58,680 --> 01:38:59,540
They're literally chilling.

2985
01:38:59,540 --> 01:39:00,020
No, no, no.

2986
01:39:00,140 --> 01:39:00,840
We're good.

2987
01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:02,640
We are chilling even more.

2988
01:39:02,780 --> 01:39:04,980
Like, right now, we have access to B very easily.

2989
01:39:05,620 --> 01:39:07,760
If you want to take potshots, I'm not going to tell you no.

2990
01:39:08,980 --> 01:39:10,880
If you want to take potshots, and then you buy me back the sniper.

2991
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:11,820
Okay.

2992
01:39:13,740 --> 01:39:14,680
I'm heading over.

2993
01:39:14,920 --> 01:39:15,520
What is this thing?

2994
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:17,760
Alright, I'll grab my club.

2995
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:19,680
I'm going to head over.

2996
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:24,700
Holy shit, it's so far!

2997
01:39:26,860 --> 01:39:28,320
Guys, I won't lose the...

2998
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:29,760
Guys, it's going to be okay, guys.

2999
01:39:29,860 --> 01:39:32,540
If I die, the devs are going to give me their legendary armor.

3000
01:39:32,980 --> 01:39:35,300
And then they're going to give me another sniper, guys.

3001
01:39:36,140 --> 01:39:37,280
Guys, I won't die.

3002
01:39:37,620 --> 01:39:38,460
There's no way.

3003
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:41,500
Guys, trust me.

3004
01:39:42,020 --> 01:39:42,740
He's going to...

3005
01:39:42,740 --> 01:39:43,260
Okay.

3006
01:39:46,180 --> 01:39:47,480
He's going to give me his...

3007
01:39:47,480 --> 01:39:48,860
He's going to give me his armor.

3008
01:39:49,260 --> 01:39:50,480
He has an orange armor.

3009
01:39:50,940 --> 01:39:51,980
And then he's going to...

3010
01:39:51,980 --> 01:39:54,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3011
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:55,120
I'm getting that B.

3012
01:39:56,140 --> 01:39:57,060
I'm getting those kills.

3013
01:39:57,940 --> 01:39:59,200
You're not going to expect it.

3014
01:39:59,620 --> 01:40:00,500
I believe, I believe.

3015
01:40:09,740 --> 01:40:10,760
They don't know.

3016
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:13,360
They're like, where is she?

3017
01:40:13,720 --> 01:40:14,920
They're like, where is she?

3018
01:40:14,940 --> 01:40:15,420
I really don't know.

3019
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:18,320
They know where I am.

3020
01:40:22,700 --> 01:40:24,140
Wait, dowsing effect?

3021
01:40:24,940 --> 01:40:27,120
Oh, is that the gun poison?

3022
01:40:28,380 --> 01:40:28,980
Yeah.

3023
01:40:29,020 --> 01:40:31,480
So, there are status effects that you can...

3024
01:40:31,480 --> 01:40:33,040
That you can deal.

3025
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:34,200
Oh.

3026
01:40:34,620 --> 01:40:35,580
I see.

3027
01:40:36,160 --> 01:40:38,580
So, like, there's fire, there's poison.

3028
01:40:39,660 --> 01:40:40,260
Uh...

3029
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:42,280
I think that's their ammo.

3030
01:40:42,280 --> 01:40:44,160
Guys, I'm coming back.

3031
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:44,680
I'm scared.

3032
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:51,180
Guys, I'm walking in a straight line.

3033
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:51,580
Guys, I'm walking in a straight line.

3034
01:40:51,640 --> 01:40:53,180
There might be a life.

3035
01:40:56,160 --> 01:40:57,320
I'm so scared.

3036
01:40:58,780 --> 01:40:59,380
I'm so scared.

3037
01:40:59,380 --> 01:40:59,440
Oh, fuck!

3038
01:40:59,860 --> 01:41:01,200
Guys, I'm so scared.

3039
01:41:01,220 --> 01:41:02,220
I'm getting shot at.

3040
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:03,720
You win these.

3041
01:41:03,900 --> 01:41:04,460
You're fine.

3042
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:06,860
There's an airstrike for sure.

3043
01:41:08,180 --> 01:41:08,640
Oh!

3044
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:14,800
They'll never expect me in the fucking water.

3045
01:41:15,100 --> 01:41:15,940
I swear to god.

3046
01:41:16,060 --> 01:41:18,480
If I die in the water, I swear to fucking god.

3047
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:19,560
Yo, get in here!

3048
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:20,920
Get in here, snail!

3049
01:41:21,180 --> 01:41:21,540
No!

3050
01:41:22,700 --> 01:41:24,860
You're gonna be coming behind some people they'll see.

3051
01:41:25,220 --> 01:41:26,280
Oh, shit!

3052
01:41:29,380 --> 01:41:30,840
Come on, get over here.

3053
01:41:30,940 --> 01:41:32,080
There's snails that you can kill.

3054
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:33,600
I'm coming.

3055
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:33,840
I'm coming.

3056
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:34,640
We're both behind you.

3057
01:41:34,660 --> 01:41:35,140
We're both behind you.

3058
01:41:35,140 --> 01:41:36,000
He's so low!

3059
01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:39,660
That's fucking where you're scared now, you bitch!

3060
01:41:41,120 --> 01:41:41,900
Guys, guys.

3061
01:41:42,140 --> 01:41:42,540
Please.

3062
01:41:42,620 --> 01:41:43,540
She's so low.

3063
01:41:46,660 --> 01:41:48,720
Give me my shield back.

3064
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:49,480
Give me my shield back.

3065
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:50,840
Oh, we did it.

3066
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:51,320
We did it.

3067
01:41:51,340 --> 01:41:51,640
Okay.

3068
01:41:58,080 --> 01:41:59,160
We did it.

3069
01:42:00,260 --> 01:42:00,780
Yay!

3070
01:42:03,640 --> 01:42:04,600
Did we win?

3071
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:05,340
We won!

3072
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:07,700
We did it!

3073
01:42:11,120 --> 01:42:11,640
Yay!

3074
01:42:13,080 --> 01:42:14,600
We did it.

3075
01:42:14,840 --> 01:42:15,700
We just needed a warm up match.

3076
01:42:16,100 --> 01:42:18,480
We just needed to understand the game.

3077
01:42:19,020 --> 01:42:21,560
She needed a warm up match and P Diddy.

3078
01:42:22,360 --> 01:42:23,680
I just need that gun.

3079
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:24,600
I need that gun.

3080
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:35,140
And that gun right there is an example of how the game encourages you to try shit out.

3081
01:42:35,300 --> 01:42:37,180
You could literally build that game.

3082
01:42:37,320 --> 01:42:38,280
So, another cool thing.

3083
01:42:38,700 --> 01:42:40,820
Imagine I killed you with that gun, right?

3084
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:41,060
Yeah.

3085
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:43,780
And you picked it up and you tried it yourself.

3086
01:42:43,900 --> 01:42:45,000
Oh my god, guys!

3087
01:42:45,140 --> 01:42:46,120
I got six kills!

3088
01:42:46,440 --> 01:42:48,320
Look at these losers with zero!

3089
01:42:48,440 --> 01:42:52,420
On the top of your death screen, you can actually see what weapons you were dead by.

3090
01:42:52,580 --> 01:42:55,540
And you can copy people's guns and make it yourself.

3091
01:42:55,880 --> 01:42:55,940
Oh!

3092
01:42:57,200 --> 01:42:57,820
That's cool!

3093
01:42:58,320 --> 01:42:59,540
So, how do I copy again?

3094
01:43:01,040 --> 01:43:09,660
You won't be able to copy right now, but whenever you die, and you look at the top left of your respawn screen, it's gonna show you how you died, who killed you.

3095
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:11,400
Click on where it says how you died.

3096
01:43:12,040 --> 01:43:13,700
It'll show the gun that killed you.

3097
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:14,620
That's the most damage!

3098
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:16,440
And it saves it to your profile.

3099
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:20,040
And then you just go straight over to a weapons terminal.

3100
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:20,580
Oh!

3101
01:43:21,660 --> 01:43:24,560
And it'll be like, hey, here's a gun that you copied.

3102
01:43:24,860 --> 01:43:25,920
This is how you build it.

3103
01:43:25,940 --> 01:43:28,680
Wait, since you're a dev, can you just put the gun in my account?

3104
01:43:29,580 --> 01:43:31,000
Uh, not with this build, no.

3105
01:43:31,100 --> 01:43:31,600
Oh, okay.

3106
01:43:32,900 --> 01:43:34,120
I'm trying to get those cheats already.

3107
01:43:38,260 --> 01:43:38,720
It's just easier, Chad!

3108
01:43:38,720 --> 01:43:40,040
It's just easier, Chad!

3109
01:43:41,060 --> 01:43:42,680
There is actually a streamer mode.

3110
01:43:42,980 --> 01:43:45,400
If you go to the audio, tap on the settings.

3111
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:45,740
No, it's okay.

3112
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:48,520
She's like, it stays.

3113
01:43:49,540 --> 01:43:50,060
It's okay.

3114
01:43:50,220 --> 01:43:52,520
I want to listen to the copyright music.

3115
01:43:56,500 --> 01:43:57,480
I'm still...

3116
01:43:57,480 --> 01:43:59,160
I'm still to this day...

3117
01:43:59,160 --> 01:44:01,100
Because I have the most damage.

3118
01:44:01,240 --> 01:44:01,920
I'm gaming.

3119
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:03,820
This is my second game.

3120
01:44:03,980 --> 01:44:05,620
And I'm the most damaged, Chad.

3121
01:44:06,100 --> 01:44:07,160
I'm out of time.

3122
01:44:07,220 --> 01:44:07,960
I'm fucking gaming.

3123
01:44:08,020 --> 01:44:09,980
I have more damage than the fucking developer.

3124
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:18,140
Let's see what happens with everybody when they come back in.

3125
01:44:18,780 --> 01:44:22,680
Toki supports small, multi-million dollar brands.

3126
01:44:22,940 --> 01:44:24,440
You know who needs more money?

3127
01:44:24,540 --> 01:44:26,580
The guy who fucking made the final countdown.

3128
01:44:27,100 --> 01:44:30,740
Like, it's not like they play that song every fucking New Year's or anything.

3129
01:44:32,540 --> 01:44:35,080
As it gets closer to New Year's.

3130
01:44:35,120 --> 01:44:37,820
That guy definitely needs more money.

3131
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:42,220
Alright, some battle rifle mods.

3132
01:44:42,580 --> 01:44:42,740
Oh!

3133
01:44:44,260 --> 01:44:45,260
Where's Jenny?

3134
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:47,980
True, you know what?

3135
01:44:48,060 --> 01:44:48,620
True.

3136
01:44:50,380 --> 01:44:52,020
They just had a mega contest.

3137
01:44:52,200 --> 01:44:53,440
Guys, you don't understand.

3138
01:44:53,980 --> 01:44:57,480
They're wiping their tears with only $50 bills.

3139
01:44:57,680 --> 01:45:00,480
I want them to wipe their tears with $100 bills.

3140
01:45:00,980 --> 01:45:01,460
Like...

3141
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:09,220
Oh, that's weird.

3142
01:45:12,200 --> 01:45:14,120
Because I have more damage than the developer.

3143
01:45:14,280 --> 01:45:16,080
And the amount of times he's played this fucking game.

3144
01:45:16,140 --> 01:45:17,200
Guys, I'm a gamer.

3145
01:45:18,920 --> 01:45:19,740
How kind.

3146
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:25,460
Oh, we're all talking to her.

3147
01:45:26,380 --> 01:45:27,020
Yes!

3148
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:30,540
Let's start something just by hooking up.

3149
01:45:31,020 --> 01:45:31,660
Okay.

3150
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:34,640
A medium barrel fitter that reduces recoil.

3151
01:45:35,080 --> 01:45:37,720
Bro, everybody has such fucking insane guns!

3152
01:45:38,460 --> 01:45:39,620
All these people.

3153
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:41,300
Now I got the recoil thingy.

3154
01:45:42,060 --> 01:45:46,700
Wait, equip the medium dampener to a battle rifle and save it.

3155
01:45:49,140 --> 01:45:49,780
Okay.

3156
01:45:50,500 --> 01:45:51,380
That's a weapon.

3157
01:45:53,220 --> 01:45:55,180
I'm not created anything yet.

3158
01:45:56,200 --> 01:45:57,520
Oh, you can move people?

3159
01:45:57,680 --> 01:45:58,940
How dare you move me?

3160
01:45:59,220 --> 01:46:00,620
Oh, I have a key card.

3161
01:46:00,940 --> 01:46:01,360
That wasn't me.

3162
01:46:01,480 --> 01:46:03,120
I don't have that at all.

3163
01:46:03,200 --> 01:46:05,720
Wait, I can buy a key card!

3164
01:46:05,740 --> 01:46:07,340
I can shift it to another room.

3165
01:46:07,940 --> 01:46:08,600
Alrighty, guys.

3166
01:46:08,740 --> 01:46:09,980
How are we feeling right now?

3167
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:11,320
Game three right now.

3168
01:46:11,380 --> 01:46:13,500
We could do one more if everyone's got time.

3169
01:46:13,680 --> 01:46:14,580
If everyone's got interest.

3170
01:46:14,940 --> 01:46:16,280
I won't be hurt if you don't.

3171
01:46:17,540 --> 01:46:18,700
Wait, where's the vault?

3172
01:46:19,220 --> 01:46:19,840
I'm down.

3173
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:20,960
Alright, have fun.

3174
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:23,520
Alright, cool.

3175
01:46:23,720 --> 01:46:27,920
So, before we get into game three, we're gonna play hide and seek here in the lobby.

3176
01:46:28,060 --> 01:46:29,300
It's built into the game.

3177
01:46:29,460 --> 01:46:30,860
So, go to the disco room.

3178
01:46:32,040 --> 01:46:34,020
Follow everybody into the disco room.

3179
01:46:34,440 --> 01:46:35,920
I said I was sliding around.

3180
01:46:36,140 --> 01:46:36,580
There we go.

3181
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,240
Doki got a taste of the custom weapons.

3182
01:46:41,340 --> 01:46:44,280
Wait, can you like unlock all the stuff for me?

3183
01:46:44,660 --> 01:46:45,480
I cannot.

3184
01:46:46,280 --> 01:46:46,540
I cannot.

3185
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:49,260
Give me an unlocker.

3186
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:52,780
So, Jay, is game three gonna be give custom weapons?

3187
01:46:52,780 --> 01:46:54,340
Hey, it doesn't hurt to ask, guys.

3188
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:57,220
It doesn't hurt to ask.

3189
01:46:57,680 --> 01:47:01,220
I know both of y'all are also so feel free to have fun.

3190
01:47:01,380 --> 01:47:02,760
I want Glossy!

3191
01:47:06,220 --> 01:47:10,240
I want Glossy!

3192
01:47:11,360 --> 01:47:13,060
We'll make my guns sparkle!

3193
01:47:13,940 --> 01:47:15,860
So, right down over here, it's a hide and seek.

3194
01:47:17,780 --> 01:47:20,900
It's gonna count down and allow you to sign up.

3195
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:24,340
And once you register, you're gonna see names, your name as well, on the top right screen.

3196
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:27,200
Once you see your name up there, that means you are registered for hide and seek.

3197
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:29,000
As soon as you see it, go hide.

3198
01:47:29,100 --> 01:47:30,200
Go find somewhere to hide.

3199
01:47:30,340 --> 01:47:30,540
Okay.

3200
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:35,160
Yo.

3201
01:47:36,160 --> 01:47:37,940
Be that person I have right in the front room.

3202
01:47:38,420 --> 01:47:39,800
Wait, are we going up first?

3203
01:47:39,900 --> 01:47:40,040
No.

3204
01:47:40,340 --> 01:47:41,200
Do we go up first?

3205
01:47:41,240 --> 01:47:43,020
He didn't sign up.

3206
01:47:43,160 --> 01:47:44,160
Wait, I didn't sign up?

3207
01:47:44,260 --> 01:47:44,960
I thought I did.

3208
01:47:45,340 --> 01:47:45,660
No.

3209
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:47,600
Oh, okay.

3210
01:47:47,860 --> 01:47:49,800
I'm in a different place, anyway, so.

3211
01:47:50,820 --> 01:47:51,180
Okay.

3212
01:47:51,360 --> 01:47:56,620
This game, this is basically infection in any video game you've ever played.

3213
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:00,100
One person's gonna be the infector, and they have to find everybody.

3214
01:48:00,420 --> 01:48:03,660
And once they infect that person, that person is now infecting the other person.

3215
01:48:03,800 --> 01:48:05,400
So it's hide and seek, but infection.

3216
01:48:07,140 --> 01:48:09,120
Guys, do you think I can pull off the Gibby stance?

3217
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:10,260
Maybe.

3218
01:48:12,460 --> 01:48:13,700
Okay, but like...

3219
01:48:15,120 --> 01:48:15,480
Wait.

3220
01:48:16,280 --> 01:48:17,080
What if I'm on...

3221
01:48:17,080 --> 01:48:18,640
Oh no, where do I hide?

3222
01:48:19,380 --> 01:48:21,600
What do you mean there's never been two NPCs?

3223
01:48:21,740 --> 01:48:22,640
Where do I hide?

3224
01:48:22,940 --> 01:48:23,720
There's 10 sec...

3225
01:48:23,720 --> 01:48:25,320
Why is there so many people here?

3226
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:29,240
They'll never find me here, bro.

3227
01:48:29,380 --> 01:48:33,260
Oh my god, they'll never find me here because I'm going so far away from the fucking map.

3228
01:48:33,780 --> 01:48:35,300
There's no way.

3229
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:37,040
I hate it here.

3230
01:48:37,220 --> 01:48:38,600
I had a feeling that was gonna happen.

3231
01:48:39,320 --> 01:48:41,000
There's no way they're gonna...

3232
01:48:41,500 --> 01:48:42,480
That's why I didn't hide.

3233
01:48:43,200 --> 01:48:45,540
It's so far away from everybody, guys.

3234
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:48,300
Nobody's gonna walk all the way here.

3235
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:49,720
I saw you go hide.

3236
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:59,180
My favorite thing about hide and seek is that you'll see people hide with you and you'll know exactly where to go.

3237
01:48:59,860 --> 01:49:00,320
Exactly.

3238
01:49:00,640 --> 01:49:01,240
Ah, shit.

3239
01:49:01,480 --> 01:49:02,280
There's no way.

3240
01:49:02,840 --> 01:49:07,200
It's so deep in the map there's no way they'd know the map well enough, chat.

3241
01:49:07,680 --> 01:49:08,600
There's no way.

3242
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:14,120
Alright, so I'm gonna take five minutes just to go on Twitch and see who else is streaming that way I can...

3243
01:49:14,120 --> 01:49:16,780
Lil doesn't know I'm not on Twitch, guys.

3244
01:49:17,800 --> 01:49:18,640
He's stream sniping.

3245
01:49:19,260 --> 01:49:20,720
Doesn't know I'm not on Twitch.

3246
01:49:21,200 --> 01:49:22,180
It's not stream sniping.

3247
01:49:22,220 --> 01:49:22,840
I don't have a sniper.

3248
01:49:24,780 --> 01:49:25,440
It's not that.

3249
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:28,940
I'm not on Twitch.

3250
01:49:29,820 --> 01:49:31,260
He's never gonna know.

3251
01:49:33,220 --> 01:49:34,100
Nobody got caught yet.

3252
01:49:36,820 --> 01:49:38,460
There's more to this map?

3253
01:49:39,800 --> 01:49:40,080
Yep.

3254
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:45,140
There's more to this map?

3255
01:49:45,340 --> 01:49:47,060
How fucking far is this?

3256
01:49:47,220 --> 01:49:49,960
Does it turn off the name tag over your head?

3257
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:51,060
Yes, it does.

3258
01:49:52,260 --> 01:49:54,580
Nobody can see you when they're in the Infector.

3259
01:49:55,720 --> 01:49:58,820
No one expects a YouTube stream, right?

3260
01:49:59,220 --> 01:50:02,220
Which means what you could do is just stand around like an NPC.

3261
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:06,320
Sorry, I have a person here.

3262
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:07,860
What every NPC looks like.

3263
01:50:10,120 --> 01:50:11,980
I was like, who the fuck is this guy?

3264
01:50:12,280 --> 01:50:14,320
That's why there was a dead end right over here.

3265
01:50:15,620 --> 01:50:17,700
We've just spent too much time in the lobby, Wynton.

3266
01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:18,880
Oh shit, you're right.

3267
01:50:18,920 --> 01:50:20,000
I'm hiding with a Twitch streamer.

3268
01:50:20,060 --> 01:50:20,380
Oh no.

3269
01:50:21,640 --> 01:50:22,440
Uh oh.

3270
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:26,820
Saw a naked man in the corner, bro.

3271
01:50:26,860 --> 01:50:27,860
That's not no damn NPC.

3272
01:50:28,720 --> 01:50:29,300
It's okay.

3273
01:50:29,540 --> 01:50:31,660
This map is so deep, they won't know.

3274
01:50:32,920 --> 01:50:33,640
Damn it.

3275
01:50:33,660 --> 01:50:34,060
How?

3276
01:50:34,420 --> 01:50:37,300
We didn't get caught last first, so it's fine.

3277
01:50:37,300 --> 01:50:40,720
Bro, right when you say, is that oiled up cheeks, I turn a corner and I see cheeks.

3278
01:50:40,740 --> 01:50:42,140
You're right, maybe I should keep it.

3279
01:50:43,340 --> 01:50:44,240
Maybe you're right.

3280
01:50:44,780 --> 01:50:45,860
Maybe I'll be in the middle.

3281
01:50:46,140 --> 01:50:47,440
This should've been a better spot here.

3282
01:50:48,300 --> 01:50:50,160
It should've gave me a little bit more time.

3283
01:50:50,480 --> 01:50:52,020
Every time you gate somebody.

3284
01:50:54,060 --> 01:50:54,580
It's not fair!

3285
01:50:55,080 --> 01:50:58,060
If the dev gets caught, they'll know every fucking area in the map.

3286
01:50:58,300 --> 01:51:00,260
We had a completely different lobby before this one.

3287
01:51:01,060 --> 01:51:03,480
And it had a lot of cheeky hiding spots.

3288
01:51:03,820 --> 01:51:04,420
It was fun.

3289
01:51:04,420 --> 01:51:06,000
So we're adding more.

3290
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:07,220
There's more?

3291
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:10,400
You could be anywhere.

3292
01:51:10,900 --> 01:51:10,940
No!

3293
01:51:11,080 --> 01:51:11,900
The thing!

3294
01:51:11,920 --> 01:51:14,200
Oh shit, wait, there's more than one person.

3295
01:51:14,380 --> 01:51:18,700
Wait, I just remembered, there's more than one person trying to kill me.

3296
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:19,180
You should've been behind you.

3297
01:51:20,120 --> 01:51:20,740
That's crazy.

3298
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:24,400
You literally could be behind somebody and they wouldn't hear you.

3299
01:51:24,440 --> 01:51:24,600
No.

3300
01:51:25,640 --> 01:51:26,440
That's crazy.

3301
01:51:26,760 --> 01:51:28,200
I was trying to bait him.

3302
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:32,100
I wanted to bait him.

3303
01:51:33,540 --> 01:51:35,500
I was trying to get a full 360.

3304
01:51:38,340 --> 01:51:39,120
Kick again.

3305
01:51:39,220 --> 01:51:40,000
Maybe look up.

3306
01:51:40,140 --> 01:51:41,780
Oh, you beat it!

3307
01:51:41,880 --> 01:51:43,460
He's so locked in!

3308
01:51:44,420 --> 01:51:45,800
He's so locked in!

3309
01:51:46,160 --> 01:51:47,460
You can't find him.

3310
01:51:47,460 --> 01:51:48,220
You're trying your best.

3311
01:51:49,460 --> 01:51:52,020
He's so locked in right now.

3312
01:51:53,200 --> 01:51:54,380
Is that you, Nico?

3313
01:51:54,440 --> 01:51:55,960
You did the same thing as you did yesterday.

3314
01:51:56,300 --> 01:51:56,860
Wait a minute.

3315
01:51:57,060 --> 01:51:57,460
Ignore me.

3316
01:51:57,500 --> 01:51:57,800
Ignore me.

3317
01:51:58,000 --> 01:51:58,700
I'm not here.

3318
01:51:58,780 --> 01:51:59,480
Don't worry about it.

3319
01:52:00,760 --> 01:52:01,460
Ignore me.

3320
01:52:02,220 --> 01:52:03,880
I think that is you.

3321
01:52:03,900 --> 01:52:04,280
He's a little guy.

3322
01:52:04,520 --> 01:52:05,280
They don't know.

3323
01:52:05,440 --> 01:52:07,180
They don't know this area.

3324
01:52:07,740 --> 01:52:08,100
JJ!

3325
01:52:08,860 --> 01:52:12,200
Wait, there's two, four, six, seven.

3326
01:52:12,400 --> 01:52:12,800
Got him.

3327
01:52:13,320 --> 01:52:15,660
Guys, I'm already halfway through.

3328
01:52:15,900 --> 01:52:17,860
I need everyone to panic right now.

3329
01:52:19,440 --> 01:52:20,660
Not my favorite.

3330
01:52:21,120 --> 01:52:21,640
I think they found Froggy, no?

3331
01:52:22,420 --> 01:52:23,720
Yeah, we found Froggy.

3332
01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:24,820
Oh, he's not dead.

3333
01:52:26,080 --> 01:52:26,600
No!

3334
01:52:27,320 --> 01:52:27,840
Wow!

3335
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:29,580
I found out.

3336
01:52:29,580 --> 01:52:30,960
I saw him hide.

3337
01:52:32,060 --> 01:52:33,360
Oh, on top of that machine.

3338
01:52:34,160 --> 01:52:35,140
Yo, what's up, bro?

3339
01:52:39,100 --> 01:52:40,400
Oh my gosh.

3340
01:52:40,680 --> 01:52:41,940
Y'all are fighting everybody, bro.

3341
01:52:42,260 --> 01:52:42,880
What's up?

3342
01:52:43,560 --> 01:52:44,160
Wait.

3343
01:52:44,300 --> 01:52:45,460
Please don't.

3344
01:52:45,900 --> 01:52:46,500
Please.

3345
01:52:48,560 --> 01:52:50,840
I don't know where to go!

3346
01:52:53,580 --> 01:52:55,320
They did it!

3347
01:52:58,740 --> 01:52:59,920
Who's not talking?

3348
01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:02,600
I'm just like, where the fuck do I go?

3349
01:53:03,260 --> 01:53:03,420
You're just standing there.

3350
01:53:03,420 --> 01:53:05,580
Let me look behind you.

3351
01:53:05,620 --> 01:53:06,700
No, try.

3352
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:07,500
No way.

3353
01:53:07,900 --> 01:53:09,680
This is not fair!

3354
01:53:10,340 --> 01:53:12,140
Why would you take a shower?

3355
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:13,160
Why?

3356
01:53:16,440 --> 01:53:19,640
Why the fuck did you do this?

3357
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:21,660
Somebody gotta find us and make this movie.

3358
01:53:22,280 --> 01:53:23,460
No escape.

3359
01:53:23,600 --> 01:53:24,820
We got 29 seconds.

3360
01:53:25,320 --> 01:53:25,840
This is bullshit.

3361
01:53:25,980 --> 01:53:28,400
This is so bullshit.

3362
01:53:29,200 --> 01:53:31,800
I can't believe it.

3363
01:53:33,240 --> 01:53:34,360
So fucked.

3364
01:53:35,620 --> 01:53:36,240
Who's that?

3365
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:37,580
Who's that I'm looking at?

3366
01:53:38,120 --> 01:53:39,200
Oh, it's two of you.

3367
01:53:39,280 --> 01:53:39,800
Three of you.

3368
01:53:41,280 --> 01:53:43,780
I'm actually so fucked.

3369
01:53:44,120 --> 01:53:45,660
Oh, no way.

3370
01:53:45,960 --> 01:53:47,180
Oh, wow.

3371
01:53:47,360 --> 01:53:48,220
It almost worked.

3372
01:53:48,440 --> 01:53:49,760
It almost worked.

3373
01:53:49,980 --> 01:53:51,800
I'm so fucked, man.

3374
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:52,780
Damn it.

3375
01:53:52,780 --> 01:53:53,860
I'm so sad.

3376
01:53:55,060 --> 01:53:56,000
Hold on.

3377
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:56,360
No way.

3378
01:53:57,600 --> 01:53:58,260
Look.

3379
01:53:58,540 --> 01:53:59,200
No.

3380
01:53:59,660 --> 01:54:00,320
Wow.

3381
01:54:00,760 --> 01:54:01,780
That's cheating.

3382
01:54:03,780 --> 01:54:05,460
I'm just standing in the rock.

3383
01:54:05,960 --> 01:54:07,340
What the fuck?

3384
01:54:07,640 --> 01:54:09,620
The moment I go down there.

3385
01:54:09,880 --> 01:54:11,220
You were in that spot.

3386
01:54:11,220 --> 01:54:13,340
The moment I go down there.

3387
01:54:13,400 --> 01:54:14,480
What the fuck?

3388
01:54:14,780 --> 01:54:16,220
How the fuck did you get there?

3389
01:54:16,820 --> 01:54:17,960
I just died.

3390
01:54:17,960 --> 01:54:18,340
This is wild.

3391
01:54:19,260 --> 01:54:20,660
There's two rocks I found.

3392
01:54:20,720 --> 01:54:21,560
You can stand inside.

3393
01:54:21,780 --> 01:54:22,640
Oh, yeah.

3394
01:54:22,740 --> 01:54:22,920
Wow.

3395
01:54:23,340 --> 01:54:26,000
This one you can get even crazier with it.

3396
01:54:26,180 --> 01:54:27,380
Nah, that's OD.

3397
01:54:28,040 --> 01:54:29,560
These people are OD.

3398
01:54:30,160 --> 01:54:31,760
This is not how you see me.

3399
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:33,860
This is not how you see me.

3400
01:54:34,600 --> 01:54:35,300
Where am I?

3401
01:54:36,620 --> 01:54:38,860
I know where I am.

3402
01:54:39,360 --> 01:54:39,880
Nah.

3403
01:54:40,180 --> 01:54:41,940
This is not okay.

3404
01:54:44,080 --> 01:54:45,900
Bro, all of you could have been right here.

3405
01:54:46,080 --> 01:54:46,700
These guys have played so long.

3406
01:54:48,640 --> 01:54:49,740
Guys, I won.

3407
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:51,700
And they fucking played for so long.

3408
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:53,500
Guys, most damage?

3409
01:54:53,720 --> 01:54:55,320
And they played for how long?

3410
01:54:57,520 --> 01:54:58,920
You know what?

3411
01:54:59,100 --> 01:55:01,520
Guys, I'm happy with how well I'm doing.

3412
01:55:04,820 --> 01:55:06,640
They played for how long?

3413
01:55:06,800 --> 01:55:09,560
And I got most damage in this fucking lobby?

3414
01:55:17,960 --> 01:55:19,800
I just died.

3415
01:55:20,120 --> 01:55:21,180
I was crazy.

3416
01:55:21,280 --> 01:55:22,180
Nobody was looking for me.

3417
01:55:23,880 --> 01:55:25,160
Maybe it wasn't looking for you.

3418
01:55:25,160 --> 01:55:26,380
They should have had the same weapon.

3419
01:55:27,620 --> 01:55:29,280
If they played for so long.

3420
01:55:29,900 --> 01:55:31,440
If they played for so long.

3421
01:55:31,540 --> 01:55:34,060
They should be able to custom make the same weapon.

3422
01:55:34,600 --> 01:55:36,020
You said you were gonna sit over.

3423
01:55:36,700 --> 01:55:37,760
I'm so humble.

3424
01:55:38,740 --> 01:55:42,260
Guys, they tried to give me a controller that wasn't pregnant.

3425
01:55:42,540 --> 01:55:43,440
I deserve this.

3426
01:55:45,980 --> 01:55:49,620
If there's no one on the screen, press P and there should be one next to my name.

3427
01:55:49,760 --> 01:55:50,200
Guys.

3428
01:55:51,620 --> 01:55:53,600
Please complete my mission.

3429
01:55:54,280 --> 01:55:55,560
I can't even.

3430
01:55:56,900 --> 01:55:58,660
Okay, where is my mission?

3431
01:55:59,380 --> 01:56:00,000
Guys, please.

3432
01:56:00,040 --> 01:56:01,060
I can't be the last one.

3433
01:56:03,100 --> 01:56:04,020
Okay, there we go.

3434
01:56:04,440 --> 01:56:05,420
Here we go.

3435
01:56:06,880 --> 01:56:08,000
Yeah, go talk to Chip.

3436
01:56:08,200 --> 01:56:08,920
There we go.

3437
01:56:09,080 --> 01:56:10,360
I complete my mission.

3438
01:56:10,460 --> 01:56:10,920
Let's go.

3439
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:13,600
Yeah.

3440
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:15,780
Do I need a vial core to Jenny?

3441
01:56:16,180 --> 01:56:16,800
Who's Jenny?

3442
01:56:17,460 --> 01:56:18,480
Oh, that's her.

3443
01:56:22,100 --> 01:56:22,600
Don't.

3444
01:56:22,600 --> 01:56:23,200
It's not me.

3445
01:56:23,360 --> 01:56:24,140
That's for sure.

3446
01:56:24,560 --> 01:56:25,520
I'm not that guy.

3447
01:56:27,640 --> 01:56:31,200
I have a vial core for you.

3448
01:56:31,460 --> 01:56:32,160
Oh, yeah.

3449
01:56:33,740 --> 01:56:38,020
Most of the character's items will be locked behind a reputation requirement.

3450
01:56:38,260 --> 01:56:38,600
Most of the character's items will be locked behind a reputation requirement.

3451
01:56:38,600 --> 01:56:39,080
This character belongs.

3452
01:56:40,900 --> 01:56:42,660
Donating vial cores to a character.

3453
01:56:45,620 --> 01:56:46,020
Okay.

3454
01:56:46,020 --> 01:56:46,900
Where do you think you're going to go?

3455
01:56:47,560 --> 01:56:48,320
Well done.

3456
01:56:48,780 --> 01:56:49,760
I did it.

3457
01:56:49,980 --> 01:56:52,840
To the left of the firing range you can interact with.

3458
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:56,160
Iko, the only thing I'm not saying is that you're not readied up.

3459
01:56:57,780 --> 01:56:58,180
Iko, the only thing I'm not saying is that you're not readied up.

3460
01:56:58,180 --> 01:56:59,280
No, he's just doing the Jenny mission.

3461
01:56:59,280 --> 01:57:00,580
No, he's just doing the Jenny mission.

3462
01:57:00,760 --> 01:57:00,820
Oh, okay.

3463
01:57:03,160 --> 01:57:03,560
What?

3464
01:57:03,560 --> 01:57:05,040
You don't need to wait for me.

3465
01:57:07,500 --> 01:57:08,620
It's not me.

3466
01:57:08,840 --> 01:57:10,940
You don't have to wait for me.

3467
01:57:12,240 --> 01:57:13,460
I keep donating?

3468
01:57:14,080 --> 01:57:14,420
Yes, I do.

3469
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:16,280
Yeah, go talk to that guy.

3470
01:57:19,360 --> 01:57:21,400
Why did I get called out?

3471
01:57:22,080 --> 01:57:23,180
I have to customize the weapon.

3472
01:57:23,460 --> 01:57:24,860
Take your time with it.

3473
01:57:24,940 --> 01:57:25,780
We can just do it.

3474
01:57:26,260 --> 01:57:31,420
So, when the weapon stats, when the power increases, why are the numbers red?

3475
01:57:32,580 --> 01:57:35,780
Why is it doing the missions because it was there?

3476
01:57:36,540 --> 01:57:38,040
Can you build a weapon?

3477
01:57:38,720 --> 01:57:43,020
Yeah, so like, traditionally, green is better, red is worse.

3478
01:57:43,240 --> 01:57:46,460
But when you have the standard barrel, right?

3479
01:57:46,580 --> 01:57:47,420
Your power is at 125.

3480
01:57:47,980 --> 01:57:53,580
When you equip the medium barrel, the damper, the red numbers go up by 110.

3481
01:57:54,820 --> 01:57:56,660
Like, insane gun customization.

3482
01:57:57,480 --> 01:57:58,880
Yeah, I'm readied up, guys!

3483
01:57:59,300 --> 01:58:00,300
I'm readied up.

3484
01:58:00,500 --> 01:58:01,180
Is this my stream?

3485
01:58:01,780 --> 01:58:02,380
Nerd.

3486
01:58:03,280 --> 01:58:07,140
Oh, so that's why it's red.

3487
01:58:07,280 --> 01:58:07,660
Okay.

3488
01:58:08,600 --> 01:58:12,060
Alright, and power being the currency in-game.

3489
01:58:12,680 --> 01:58:13,300
Oh, okay.

3490
01:58:13,740 --> 01:58:14,120
Okay.

3491
01:58:15,600 --> 01:58:17,700
Sorry, I had to step away quickly.

3492
01:58:17,900 --> 01:58:18,700
But I did get the question.

3493
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:20,080
Eiko, were you answering it?

3494
01:58:21,400 --> 01:58:21,780
No.

3495
01:58:22,340 --> 01:58:23,000
I got it.

3496
01:58:24,320 --> 01:58:25,240
Sorry about that.

3497
01:58:25,300 --> 01:58:25,680
No.

3498
01:58:27,100 --> 01:58:28,400
I didn't mean to step away like that.

3499
01:58:29,380 --> 01:58:30,560
I see how you are.

3500
01:58:30,900 --> 01:58:32,000
Because I was calling you.

3501
01:58:32,280 --> 01:58:35,540
The custom thing might be, like, hard for you to get used to.

3502
01:58:35,540 --> 01:58:36,320
I'm gonna be honest, man.

3503
01:58:36,360 --> 01:58:37,260
You're being out-rizzed.

3504
01:58:39,060 --> 01:58:39,420
Oh, wait.

3505
01:58:40,480 --> 01:58:40,840
We?

3506
01:58:41,600 --> 01:58:42,840
Wait, let's see what you're selling.

3507
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:45,740
Oh, this is the EMP.

3508
01:58:46,180 --> 01:58:47,640
She has home advantage, quite literally.

3509
01:58:49,200 --> 01:58:52,660
If anyone's interested to know what I got called to, she was like, come here, come here.

3510
01:58:52,780 --> 01:58:54,580
I was like, what the f- Oh my god, I thought it was like an emergency.

3511
01:58:55,240 --> 01:58:57,160
She's making dinner right now.

3512
01:58:57,200 --> 01:58:58,800
She found an egg with two yolks in it.

3513
01:58:59,900 --> 01:59:01,320
Oh, I could get a hacker.

3514
01:59:01,980 --> 01:59:02,900
I wouldn't use it.

3515
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:07,340
Wait, they have they have reputation 3?

3516
01:59:07,720 --> 01:59:10,360
That just means double- How fucking much did they play?

3517
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:13,580
Let me know how it turned out.

3518
01:59:13,700 --> 01:59:13,980
Alright.

3519
01:59:15,500 --> 01:59:16,220
My man.

3520
01:59:17,120 --> 01:59:17,480
Bro.

3521
01:59:18,780 --> 01:59:20,800
He has reputation 3.

3522
01:59:23,300 --> 01:59:24,420
God, I wish that were me.

3523
01:59:25,620 --> 01:59:26,340
That's crazy.

3524
01:59:26,620 --> 01:59:29,020
You know what this guy, the developer's voice sounds like?

3525
01:59:29,220 --> 01:59:30,220
She goes, come here, come here.

3526
01:59:30,340 --> 01:59:31,760
I look at her, she's like, it's twins.

3527
01:59:33,340 --> 01:59:40,680
I can't help but think, because I used to watch Overwatch streamers and also play a lot of Overwatch, he literally sounds like Emon.

3528
01:59:45,880 --> 01:59:47,560
He's an Overwatch streamer.

3529
01:59:47,640 --> 01:59:50,100
I couldn't get it out of my head when I was like, that's Emon.

3530
01:59:53,320 --> 01:59:54,860
He's an Overwatch OG.

3531
02:00:01,760 --> 02:00:08,680
I just see him as Emon, but what if instead of maxing out on Overwatch, he maxes out on game devs in the 80s?

3532
02:00:09,080 --> 02:00:11,600
What if it is Emon?

3533
02:00:18,380 --> 02:00:20,100
Am I Insider?

3534
02:00:21,100 --> 02:00:22,100
What am I?

3535
02:00:31,760 --> 02:00:32,520
80s Emon.

3536
02:00:33,300 --> 02:00:35,460
Wait, get more pricks?

3537
02:00:35,640 --> 02:00:36,760
I don't have a lot.

3538
02:00:38,920 --> 02:00:41,140
What other pricks do I have?

3539
02:00:44,500 --> 02:00:46,220
Yeah, I don't have anymore.

3540
02:00:46,660 --> 02:00:47,700
Guys, I'm broke.

3541
02:00:49,560 --> 02:00:50,620
I'm new here.

3542
02:00:51,860 --> 02:00:53,260
Emon is so good.

3543
02:00:53,500 --> 02:00:54,820
They made the two.

3544
02:00:56,620 --> 02:00:58,580
And Emon in each game.

3545
02:00:59,080 --> 02:01:01,220
He literally sounds like Emon.

3546
02:01:02,780 --> 02:01:03,540
Most wins?

3547
02:01:03,820 --> 02:01:04,000
Boom.

3548
02:01:04,780 --> 02:01:05,180
54?

3549
02:01:08,560 --> 02:01:10,380
Boom, that's good.

3550
02:01:10,920 --> 02:01:11,540
Here we go.

3551
02:01:12,940 --> 02:01:15,160
So this is the last one of the night?

3552
02:01:15,640 --> 02:01:16,780
Yep, this is the last one.

3553
02:01:17,780 --> 02:01:20,320
Bro, he only played two games.

3554
02:01:20,560 --> 02:01:22,340
How did he fucking have 54?

3555
02:01:23,420 --> 02:01:24,440
We got our feedback.

3556
02:01:24,620 --> 02:01:25,740
Just go ahead and make them quit.

3557
02:01:26,260 --> 02:01:28,020
Yeah, go ahead and get your custom weapons.

3558
02:01:28,380 --> 02:01:28,900
Do your work.

3559
02:01:28,920 --> 02:01:30,060
Now I can brag.

3560
02:01:33,400 --> 02:01:35,810
He just really likes the 80s.

3561
02:01:36,300 --> 02:01:40,840
He just really likes the 80s.

3562
02:01:43,380 --> 02:01:45,640
That would be a truly epic gamer moment.

3563
02:01:48,420 --> 02:01:49,720
Oh, where's me?

3564
02:01:50,340 --> 02:01:50,920
Shotgun.

3565
02:01:52,460 --> 02:01:53,040
Okay.

3566
02:01:55,660 --> 02:01:57,320
I'm gonna still keep the shotgun.

3567
02:01:57,460 --> 02:02:01,740
I think the shotgun is the best in terms of what I have.

3568
02:02:01,740 --> 02:02:05,640
In terms of default-wise, this is like all I can have.

3569
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:22,240
That means he has enough time to do at least enough games to get 54 wins while waiting for the matches to start, guys.

3570
02:02:22,400 --> 02:02:24,900
That doesn't make it better.

3571
02:02:29,140 --> 02:02:33,440
He was in the lobby long enough during playtest.

3572
02:02:37,020 --> 02:02:39,720
Are you talking about that Oreo Coca-Cola again?

3573
02:02:39,920 --> 02:02:40,740
Alright, let's go.

3574
02:02:41,420 --> 02:02:43,080
He spat around them.

3575
02:02:43,680 --> 02:02:45,440
Guys, I told you I didn't need a ping.

3576
02:02:45,540 --> 02:02:46,520
I never pinged once.

3577
02:02:47,460 --> 02:02:48,300
Did I ping?

3578
02:02:48,460 --> 02:02:49,380
No, I didn't.

3579
02:02:49,380 --> 02:02:50,320
I didn't ping at all.

3580
02:02:53,580 --> 02:02:55,220
Where the fuck are the snails?

3581
02:02:56,360 --> 02:02:56,800
Snails?

3582
02:02:58,500 --> 02:03:00,120
Where are the snails?

3583
02:03:00,360 --> 02:03:01,480
It's time to...

3584
02:03:02,220 --> 02:03:04,320
It's time to kill all snails.

3585
02:03:05,320 --> 02:03:06,040
Frog.

3586
02:03:07,600 --> 02:03:08,560
Hello, frog.

3587
02:03:09,240 --> 02:03:09,960
Hello.

3588
02:03:11,100 --> 02:03:12,340
Where is it?

3589
02:03:12,960 --> 02:03:14,440
Yeah, never ping.

3590
02:03:14,540 --> 02:03:16,540
Keep your team guessing exactly.

3591
02:03:16,980 --> 02:03:19,600
I'm just parkouring until I find a snail.

3592
02:03:19,940 --> 02:03:21,420
But where is the fucking snail?

3593
02:03:22,020 --> 02:03:23,440
I've seen one.

3594
02:03:24,280 --> 02:03:25,620
Why did we...

3595
02:03:26,540 --> 02:03:32,060
Can you, like, in developer chat, just add snails in our area?

3596
02:03:36,900 --> 02:03:37,380
Like...

3597
02:03:37,380 --> 02:03:43,380
If I actually had the tools for this version, I would abuse the hell out of it.

3598
02:03:43,500 --> 02:03:44,200
But I genuinely...

3599
02:03:44,200 --> 02:03:45,460
Wait, why don't you have it?

3600
02:03:46,300 --> 02:03:48,640
This is a locked down version of the game to ensure...

3601
02:03:48,640 --> 02:03:49,280
They locked it?

3602
02:03:49,520 --> 02:03:50,380
Not everybody.

3603
02:03:50,560 --> 02:03:53,080
So make sure everybody can have access to it.

3604
02:03:54,360 --> 02:03:56,000
Wait, so who has the power?

3605
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:57,380
Nobody.

3606
02:03:57,480 --> 02:03:58,140
There is no power.

3607
02:03:58,380 --> 02:04:00,960
There's no... Why are you playing this version instead of the other version?

3608
02:04:02,440 --> 02:04:04,160
Because other people can use it.

3609
02:04:04,820 --> 02:04:06,580
Yeah, but they won't.

3610
02:04:08,340 --> 02:04:09,440
You're convincing me.

3611
02:04:11,160 --> 02:04:11,920
They won't.

3612
02:04:12,540 --> 02:04:14,360
Oh, is this a... Oh, no, it's just a mega smoke.

3613
02:04:14,560 --> 02:04:16,360
Dude, where the fuck... How many... Okay, you know what?

3614
02:04:16,360 --> 02:04:16,980
We've got enough power.

3615
02:04:17,060 --> 02:04:17,800
Let's just get the hell out of here.

3616
02:04:19,680 --> 02:04:21,440
They'll only abuse it for me, child.

3617
02:04:21,540 --> 02:04:21,820
Like...

3618
02:04:26,320 --> 02:04:29,420
The developers, they wouldn't abuse it.

3619
02:04:32,280 --> 02:04:36,500
The developers wouldn't abuse it, guys.

3620
02:04:42,110 --> 02:04:43,870
Yeah, this is LG anyway.

3621
02:04:44,150 --> 02:04:45,010
I can't believe it.

3622
02:04:45,070 --> 02:04:46,130
They locked it down.

3623
02:04:46,470 --> 02:04:47,910
So I can't get...

3624
02:04:52,990 --> 02:04:54,410
Can't believe it.

3625
02:04:55,410 --> 02:04:56,770
I can't believe they would do such a thing.

3626
02:04:57,430 --> 02:04:59,670
I'm also trying to slam my dinner at the same time.

3627
02:05:00,710 --> 02:05:04,250
Guys, I just want one unfair advantage.

3628
02:05:04,590 --> 02:05:05,310
Like, just one.

3629
02:05:05,610 --> 02:05:09,330
I got half brown, eggs, and shortcut bacon.

3630
02:05:10,630 --> 02:05:12,870
I wouldn't, like, abuse it on purpose.

3631
02:05:15,710 --> 02:05:17,290
It's just gonna be an accident.

3632
02:05:17,610 --> 02:05:18,250
They'll be like, whoa.

3633
02:05:19,390 --> 02:05:22,130
What did I just accidentally picked up?

3634
02:05:26,450 --> 02:05:27,990
Just one, you know?

3635
02:05:28,030 --> 02:05:31,790
And if it turns into two, then it was a lovely coincidence.

3636
02:05:34,330 --> 02:05:35,310
Wait, where do we go?

3637
02:05:36,330 --> 02:05:38,890
We're gonna go to a shop, so that way we have all of our power.

3638
02:05:41,350 --> 02:05:42,050
There's a team here.

3639
02:05:43,650 --> 02:05:44,330
Wait, where?

3640
02:05:45,030 --> 02:05:45,870
Oh, on here.

3641
02:05:46,330 --> 02:05:48,130
Oh, there's another one in here.

3642
02:05:49,150 --> 02:05:49,710
Oh, shit.

3643
02:05:49,810 --> 02:05:50,710
Okay, I'm heading over.

3644
02:05:50,930 --> 02:05:51,330
Oh, dude.

3645
02:05:51,350 --> 02:05:51,930
I got shredded.

3646
02:05:51,930 --> 02:05:51,950
I got shredded.

3647
02:05:54,070 --> 02:05:54,390
77?

3648
02:05:55,970 --> 02:05:56,810
Oh, there's two in there.

3649
02:05:57,370 --> 02:05:57,690
Yeah.

3650
02:06:01,450 --> 02:06:02,090
Oh, you...

3651
02:06:03,210 --> 02:06:03,730
That's unlucky.

3652
02:06:05,110 --> 02:06:05,430
Okay.

3653
02:06:05,490 --> 02:06:05,770
We got this.

3654
02:06:05,870 --> 02:06:06,130
We got this.

3655
02:06:06,170 --> 02:06:06,570
Stokey carry.

3656
02:06:06,590 --> 02:06:07,190
I'm gonna...

3657
02:06:08,430 --> 02:06:09,850
I'm gonna go be up here for a sec.

3658
02:06:10,170 --> 02:06:10,970
Are they rezzing or no?

3659
02:06:12,550 --> 02:06:13,010
Can't tell.

3660
02:06:13,070 --> 02:06:13,490
We're both down.

3661
02:06:14,570 --> 02:06:15,490
Oh, someone behind me.

3662
02:06:16,490 --> 02:06:17,130
Oh, no.

3663
02:06:17,630 --> 02:06:19,710
Just play your life here, so that way you don't lose...

3664
02:06:20,410 --> 02:06:21,290
Fuck you.

3665
02:06:22,430 --> 02:06:23,630
I might be dead though.

3666
02:06:24,870 --> 02:06:25,490
Oh, wait.

3667
02:06:25,590 --> 02:06:25,810
He's...

3668
02:06:25,810 --> 02:06:26,690
He doesn't wanna...

3669
02:06:26,690 --> 02:06:28,170
Oh, that's why he doesn't wanna fight!

3670
02:06:28,350 --> 02:06:28,650
Okay.

3671
02:06:29,530 --> 02:06:30,450
Need some cover.

3672
02:06:31,910 --> 02:06:33,930
I now know why he didn't wanna fight.

3673
02:06:34,730 --> 02:06:35,330
Hold on.

3674
02:06:35,450 --> 02:06:36,630
Shields need a little tune-up.

3675
02:06:36,890 --> 02:06:37,610
Oh, shit.

3676
02:06:37,750 --> 02:06:38,610
He's looking at me.

3677
02:06:40,050 --> 02:06:40,850
Look at him back.

3678
02:06:41,170 --> 02:06:42,030
Stram down to death.

3679
02:06:42,570 --> 02:06:43,890
Calling in some fresh wheels.

3680
02:06:44,990 --> 02:06:45,430
Okay.

3681
02:06:50,630 --> 02:06:51,410
We're coming, Doki.

3682
02:06:54,930 --> 02:06:55,530
Oh, no.

3683
02:06:55,690 --> 02:06:55,850
Oh, no.

3684
02:06:57,050 --> 02:06:57,470
No!

3685
02:06:57,790 --> 02:06:58,550
I have to reload!

3686
02:06:58,710 --> 02:06:59,250
I hate that!

3687
02:07:00,470 --> 02:07:01,150
Fuck you!

3688
02:07:02,030 --> 02:07:03,630
Dude, no way, bro.

3689
02:07:03,790 --> 02:07:04,350
Cause I just...

3690
02:07:05,690 --> 02:07:08,130
Okay, I'm fucking leaving.

3691
02:07:08,650 --> 02:07:09,630
I got one over here.

3692
02:07:09,710 --> 02:07:09,970
On me.

3693
02:07:11,950 --> 02:07:13,450
Why is Q's IJ?

3694
02:07:13,630 --> 02:07:13,950
Do you know?

3695
02:07:14,390 --> 02:07:15,430
I need a reload.

3696
02:07:19,210 --> 02:07:20,190
I'm gonna attempt this.

3697
02:07:20,190 --> 02:07:20,650
It's risky.

3698
02:07:21,430 --> 02:07:21,850
Okay.

3699
02:07:21,890 --> 02:07:21,970
Okay.

3700
02:07:22,170 --> 02:07:22,230
Okay.

3701
02:07:22,370 --> 02:07:22,790
Okay.

3702
02:07:24,310 --> 02:07:25,030
Holy shit!

3703
02:07:25,050 --> 02:07:26,870
He has a red gun and he's still lost?

3704
02:07:27,850 --> 02:07:28,790
Shop shooter alert.

3705
02:07:29,230 --> 02:07:29,870
You're just better.

3706
02:07:31,270 --> 02:07:31,630
Dude.

3707
02:07:31,810 --> 02:07:32,470
Oh, my God.

3708
02:07:32,470 --> 02:07:32,850
Keep your sight.

3709
02:07:32,890 --> 02:07:33,110
Okay.

3710
02:07:33,110 --> 02:07:33,150
Wait.

3711
02:07:33,190 --> 02:07:33,510
Keep cover.

3712
02:07:33,510 --> 02:07:35,690
I'm gonna go scream in his fucking discord and tell him to fuck off.

3713
02:07:36,330 --> 02:07:36,690
Okay.

3714
02:07:36,870 --> 02:07:37,350
Now this...

3715
02:07:37,350 --> 02:07:38,190
I know this gun sucks.

3716
02:07:38,190 --> 02:07:38,410
Sorry.

3717
02:07:38,490 --> 02:07:38,910
You're out.

3718
02:07:39,010 --> 02:07:39,730
You're on your own.

3719
02:07:39,910 --> 02:07:41,430
This gun fucking sucks.

3720
02:07:42,570 --> 02:07:45,110
Well, Doki, if you run into the shop, actually, you have a lot of power.

3721
02:07:45,210 --> 02:07:46,350
I can get you a custom sniper.

3722
02:07:46,350 --> 02:07:46,650
Wait.

3723
02:07:46,650 --> 02:07:46,670
Wait.

3724
02:07:47,610 --> 02:07:47,970
Sorry.

3725
02:07:48,070 --> 02:07:48,770
You might die here.

3726
02:07:50,390 --> 02:07:52,050
Honestly, I think I'm kinda cucked.

3727
02:07:52,430 --> 02:07:52,790
Okay.

3728
02:07:56,320 --> 02:07:57,340
I'm, like, inside.

3729
02:07:57,860 --> 02:07:58,220
Wait.

3730
02:07:58,280 --> 02:07:58,800
Can I rez you?

3731
02:07:58,940 --> 02:07:59,160
No.

3732
02:07:59,200 --> 02:07:59,480
You're dead.

3733
02:07:59,620 --> 02:07:59,820
Okay.

3734
02:08:01,200 --> 02:08:02,640
I'm gonna steal your stuff, though.

3735
02:08:03,720 --> 02:08:04,160
Oh!

3736
02:08:05,640 --> 02:08:07,340
Damn chump trying to pin me down.

3737
02:08:09,960 --> 02:08:11,020
That's why he lost.

3738
02:08:11,140 --> 02:08:11,440
Yeah!

3739
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:13,200
The recoil is insane!

3740
02:08:14,620 --> 02:08:15,500
Holy shit!

3741
02:08:17,540 --> 02:08:18,080
All right.

3742
02:08:18,120 --> 02:08:19,160
I have my shotgun out.

3743
02:08:19,740 --> 02:08:21,620
That recoil was fucking crazy.

3744
02:08:22,960 --> 02:08:23,780
Do you have heals?

3745
02:08:24,660 --> 02:08:25,100
Yeah.

3746
02:08:25,580 --> 02:08:27,100
There's a health pack in here.

3747
02:08:27,200 --> 02:08:27,940
Come through this window.

3748
02:08:28,200 --> 02:08:28,520
Okay.

3749
02:08:28,760 --> 02:08:29,940
I'm genuinely afraid to leave right now.

3750
02:08:30,140 --> 02:08:30,820
This is so exciting.

3751
02:08:31,100 --> 02:08:32,440
I may have weed myself.

3752
02:08:32,760 --> 02:08:33,560
Oh, but I don't need...

3753
02:08:33,560 --> 02:08:34,080
I need shields.

3754
02:08:34,480 --> 02:08:34,580
That's a big one.

3755
02:08:34,660 --> 02:08:35,260
Watch your step.

3756
02:08:35,680 --> 02:08:36,040
Hmm.

3757
02:08:38,200 --> 02:08:41,540
If you go down to the shop down here, you can buy some shield repairs.

3758
02:08:42,320 --> 02:08:42,680
No.

3759
02:08:42,740 --> 02:08:43,340
I want a gun.

3760
02:08:44,200 --> 02:08:44,980
You want a gun?

3761
02:08:45,160 --> 02:08:45,360
Yeah.

3762
02:08:45,400 --> 02:08:45,980
I want a gun.

3763
02:08:46,060 --> 02:08:46,520
Do I deposit?

3764
02:08:47,300 --> 02:08:47,660
Yeah.

3765
02:08:47,660 --> 02:08:48,220
Go deposit.

3766
02:08:48,540 --> 02:08:48,720
Okay.

3767
02:08:50,560 --> 02:08:51,680
So, what have we got?

3768
02:08:52,880 --> 02:08:53,240
Gun tag.

3769
02:08:53,240 --> 02:08:54,240
Jay, how much is your sniper rifle?

3770
02:08:55,040 --> 02:08:56,200
I think it's like 600.

3771
02:08:57,160 --> 02:08:57,800
Shields up.

3772
02:08:58,200 --> 02:08:58,560
Shields up.

3773
02:08:58,700 --> 02:08:59,260
Got a tier 2 shield.

3774
02:08:59,420 --> 02:08:59,560
No.

3775
02:08:59,580 --> 02:08:59,660
No.

3776
02:08:59,720 --> 02:08:59,840
No.

3777
02:08:59,920 --> 02:09:00,400
It's 350.

3778
02:09:00,580 --> 02:09:00,820
Here.

3779
02:09:00,820 --> 02:09:01,080
I got it.

3780
02:09:02,300 --> 02:09:03,920
I'd say mine is like 800 or so.

3781
02:09:04,900 --> 02:09:05,440
Here you go.

3782
02:09:05,640 --> 02:09:06,740
P Diddy is all yours.

3783
02:09:06,980 --> 02:09:07,120
Oh!

3784
02:09:07,400 --> 02:09:08,620
I dropped this red gun.

3785
02:09:08,640 --> 02:09:09,360
It's garbage.

3786
02:09:09,980 --> 02:09:10,580
I'll take it.

3787
02:09:10,740 --> 02:09:11,100
Reclose.

3788
02:09:11,120 --> 02:09:11,340
Bad.

3789
02:09:12,800 --> 02:09:13,620
Oh, it's an SMG.

3790
02:09:13,660 --> 02:09:13,780
That's why.

3791
02:09:13,780 --> 02:09:14,260
Oh, Doki Doki.

3792
02:09:14,880 --> 02:09:15,240
Yeah?

3793
02:09:15,780 --> 02:09:17,120
You missed a sniper rifle as well.

3794
02:09:17,880 --> 02:09:18,620
Hey, what's this?

3795
02:09:18,880 --> 02:09:19,200
Wait.

3796
02:09:19,280 --> 02:09:19,500
Is that...

3797
02:09:19,500 --> 02:09:19,840
P Diddy.

3798
02:09:19,940 --> 02:09:20,300
Wait.

3799
02:09:20,360 --> 02:09:21,280
What gun did I get?

3800
02:09:24,240 --> 02:09:26,520
Yeah, that's a P Diddy sniper rifle I gave you last game.

3801
02:09:26,840 --> 02:09:27,220
Okay.

3802
02:09:27,740 --> 02:09:28,560
Can we go to A?

3803
02:09:29,400 --> 02:09:29,780
Yeah.

3804
02:09:29,820 --> 02:09:30,120
Let's go A.

3805
02:09:30,140 --> 02:09:30,320
Yeah, we go to A.

3806
02:09:34,440 --> 02:09:35,460
Where are people?

3807
02:09:35,560 --> 02:09:36,260
I'm scared.

3808
02:09:36,540 --> 02:09:37,500
Oh, I see him.

3809
02:09:37,540 --> 02:09:37,900
Don't worry.

3810
02:09:37,960 --> 02:09:38,420
I snipe.

3811
02:09:39,100 --> 02:09:39,700
Don't worry, guys.

3812
02:09:39,740 --> 02:09:40,220
Watch this.

3813
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:42,140
I'm not going to lose my gun.

3814
02:09:43,380 --> 02:09:44,020
I swear.

3815
02:09:44,400 --> 02:09:44,960
Oh, yeah.

3816
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:46,540
I hit 40.

3817
02:09:47,780 --> 02:09:48,540
Nice shot.

3818
02:09:50,200 --> 02:09:51,380
They're not peeking anymore.

3819
02:09:52,680 --> 02:09:53,280
On my left.

3820
02:09:53,380 --> 02:09:53,720
On my left.

3821
02:09:53,760 --> 02:09:53,940
On my left.

3822
02:09:53,940 --> 02:09:54,000
On my left.

3823
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:54,180
On my left.

3824
02:09:55,060 --> 02:09:55,380
40.

3825
02:09:55,660 --> 02:09:56,500
I'm coming to you.

3826
02:09:56,580 --> 02:09:56,800
I'm coming to you.

3827
02:09:56,860 --> 02:09:57,380
I pinged.

3828
02:09:57,800 --> 02:09:58,120
137.

3829
02:09:58,380 --> 02:09:58,440
Oh, damn.

3830
02:09:58,560 --> 02:09:58,940
Shredded him.

3831
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:02,600
Oh, they got purple shields.

3832
02:10:03,400 --> 02:10:03,720
Wait.

3833
02:10:05,260 --> 02:10:06,160
I'm going to go thirst.

3834
02:10:06,240 --> 02:10:06,900
I'm thirsting.

3835
02:10:06,900 --> 02:10:07,420
I'm thirsting.

3836
02:10:07,960 --> 02:10:08,440
Up here.

3837
02:10:08,540 --> 02:10:08,720
Up here.

3838
02:10:08,820 --> 02:10:08,860
Up here.

3839
02:10:16,320 --> 02:10:16,640
44.

3840
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:17,580
He's broke up top.

3841
02:10:17,880 --> 02:10:18,200
Yeah.

3842
02:10:18,200 --> 02:10:18,720
I hit 44.

3843
02:10:19,700 --> 02:10:20,020
Eagle.

3844
02:10:20,080 --> 02:10:20,280
Eagle.

3845
02:10:21,020 --> 02:10:21,060
Eagle.

3846
02:10:21,060 --> 02:10:21,180
Eagle.

3847
02:10:21,380 --> 02:10:21,500
Eagle.

3848
02:10:21,800 --> 02:10:22,120
Eagle.

3849
02:10:22,120 --> 02:10:22,280
Eagle.

3850
02:10:22,280 --> 02:10:22,400
Eagle.

3851
02:10:22,500 --> 02:10:22,820
Eagle.

3852
02:10:22,900 --> 02:10:23,080
Staircase.

3853
02:10:23,160 --> 02:10:23,380
Staircase.

3854
02:10:23,440 --> 02:10:23,760
Beneath you.

3855
02:10:23,840 --> 02:10:24,100
Staircase.

3856
02:10:24,200 --> 02:10:24,440
Staircase.

3857
02:10:24,840 --> 02:10:25,200
Yep.

3858
02:10:25,200 --> 02:10:25,320
Yep.

3859
02:10:25,320 --> 02:10:26,060
He went back up top.

3860
02:10:26,060 --> 02:10:26,520
He went back up top.

3861
02:10:26,540 --> 02:10:26,820
He went down.

3862
02:10:27,660 --> 02:10:28,020
Wait.

3863
02:10:28,120 --> 02:10:28,720
They fell down?

3864
02:10:29,340 --> 02:10:30,240
There's two of them, man.

3865
02:10:30,840 --> 02:10:32,540
Some of them fell down.

3866
02:10:33,500 --> 02:10:34,120
I pinged.

3867
02:10:34,140 --> 02:10:34,380
Yeah.

3868
02:10:34,380 --> 02:10:34,760
They jumped off.

3869
02:10:38,440 --> 02:10:39,700
They're all inside right now.

3870
02:10:39,760 --> 02:10:40,480
It's just hard to like...

3871
02:10:40,480 --> 02:10:40,660
Oh.

3872
02:10:40,860 --> 02:10:41,220
Yeah.

3873
02:10:41,320 --> 02:10:42,300
I don't know what we could do there.

3874
02:10:42,620 --> 02:10:43,240
Be reliable.

3875
02:10:45,560 --> 02:10:46,960
I think we're dead, actually.

3876
02:10:47,100 --> 02:10:48,080
There's something going on down here, man.

3877
02:10:48,120 --> 02:10:50,600
There's somebody that went in on down there where I pinged.

3878
02:10:51,920 --> 02:10:52,800
They probably fell down.

3879
02:10:52,800 --> 02:10:53,260
Did that blow me?

3880
02:10:55,360 --> 02:10:55,780
Wait.

3881
02:10:55,880 --> 02:10:56,860
Am I hearing things?

3882
02:10:57,120 --> 02:10:57,700
I'm scared.

3883
02:10:57,800 --> 02:10:58,920
They might be inside.

3884
02:10:59,880 --> 02:11:01,200
I'm coming over to you.

3885
02:11:01,660 --> 02:11:02,080
I'm scared.

3886
02:11:02,080 --> 02:11:02,880
There's fights over here.

3887
02:11:04,660 --> 02:11:05,740
Did we get the A?

3888
02:11:05,940 --> 02:11:06,640
Did we get it?

3889
02:11:07,240 --> 02:11:07,820
Not yet.

3890
02:11:07,840 --> 02:11:09,280
It's got to reach 100%.

3891
02:11:09,700 --> 02:11:10,120
Oh.

3892
02:11:10,740 --> 02:11:11,160
Okay.

3893
02:11:11,200 --> 02:11:12,140
I'll just stay here then.

3894
02:11:13,280 --> 02:11:14,320
And die, I guess.

3895
02:11:14,420 --> 02:11:16,120
Somebody is shooting somebody down here.

3896
02:11:17,320 --> 02:11:18,460
I hear that.

3897
02:11:18,580 --> 02:11:18,720
Yeah.

3898
02:11:19,860 --> 02:11:20,280
Oh.

3899
02:11:20,340 --> 02:11:20,900
You can actually...

3900
02:11:20,900 --> 02:11:21,000
Oh.

3901
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:21,380
That might be...

3902
02:11:21,380 --> 02:11:22,060
Looks like they grabbed B.

3903
02:11:22,100 --> 02:11:22,280
I'm asking on.

3904
02:11:22,440 --> 02:11:22,780
Oh.

3905
02:11:22,800 --> 02:11:24,200
One right here.

3906
02:11:26,540 --> 02:11:27,180
48.

3907
02:11:27,520 --> 02:11:27,880
Broke.

3908
02:11:27,980 --> 02:11:28,420
Broke.

3909
02:11:30,100 --> 02:11:30,740
Oh.

3910
02:11:30,760 --> 02:11:31,600
I shot his toesies.

3911
02:11:32,600 --> 02:11:33,420
Right here.

3912
02:11:33,440 --> 02:11:33,820
Three people.

3913
02:11:34,620 --> 02:11:36,120
I'm waiting for them to peek.

3914
02:11:41,550 --> 02:11:42,190
Down.

3915
02:11:42,470 --> 02:11:43,110
Nice.

3916
02:11:43,830 --> 02:11:44,670
Enemy down here.

3917
02:11:48,270 --> 02:11:49,610
What the fuck?

3918
02:11:51,610 --> 02:11:52,250
Oh.

3919
02:11:52,250 --> 02:11:53,030
You're scared.

3920
02:11:53,250 --> 02:11:54,530
You're fucking scared.

3921
02:11:54,850 --> 02:11:55,490
Oh.

3922
02:11:55,890 --> 02:11:55,950
Oh.

3923
02:11:56,070 --> 02:11:56,430
Oh.

3924
02:11:56,430 --> 02:11:56,550
Oh.

3925
02:11:58,330 --> 02:11:58,770
What are you doing?

3926
02:11:58,830 --> 02:11:58,850
You take so much...

3927
02:12:01,480 --> 02:12:03,260
Why is A taking so long?

3928
02:12:03,500 --> 02:12:04,120
Compared to B.

3929
02:12:05,700 --> 02:12:06,020
Oh.

3930
02:12:06,040 --> 02:12:07,700
I think I have a hacking device, actually.

3931
02:12:07,860 --> 02:12:10,000
Yeah, they might have had a hacking device to meet here.

3932
02:12:10,020 --> 02:12:10,140
Oh...

3933
02:12:10,140 --> 02:12:10,380
I don't know...

3934
02:12:10,380 --> 02:12:11,220
Well, she did.

3935
02:12:11,860 --> 02:12:12,180
Those cheaters.

3936
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:16,640
All right.

3937
02:12:16,680 --> 02:12:17,800
We're running this back to A.

3938
02:12:17,880 --> 02:12:19,320
If you want to camp, you can...

3939
02:12:19,320 --> 02:12:19,940
Yeah, yeah.

3940
02:12:20,060 --> 02:12:22,500
...ieni- Oh, where's C?

3941
02:12:24,160 --> 02:12:25,480
C hasn't been discovered yet.

3942
02:12:25,560 --> 02:12:26,100
So, you got to...

3943
02:12:26,100 --> 02:12:26,180
Oh, yeah.

3944
02:12:26,180 --> 02:12:29,500
You either gotta wait for it to unlock or you gotta scan for it.

3945
02:12:30,440 --> 02:12:32,060
Okay, I'll just wait here.

3946
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:34,040
Or snipe.

3947
02:12:35,620 --> 02:12:36,380
Or die.

3948
02:12:40,880 --> 02:12:42,140
There's nobody here.

3949
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:43,960
Everybody's quiet.

3950
02:12:45,400 --> 02:12:48,280
I think a lot of people lost a lot of lives in the very beginning.

3951
02:12:50,460 --> 02:12:52,440
Sniper douchebag on me, my dudes.

3952
02:12:53,840 --> 02:12:54,500
I'm better.

3953
02:12:56,860 --> 02:12:57,960
Anyone cheating, EJ?

3954
02:12:58,280 --> 02:12:59,640
That's fucking right, I'm still better.

3955
02:12:59,920 --> 02:13:00,900
I don't see no one.

3956
02:13:11,680 --> 02:13:13,300
That's fucking right, leave.

3957
02:13:13,440 --> 02:13:15,440
You know I'm better at sniping than you.

3958
02:13:20,840 --> 02:13:21,780
Oh, you're scared!

3959
02:13:22,100 --> 02:13:22,420
Yeah, that's right!

3960
02:13:22,440 --> 02:13:23,860
That's fucking right, run, bitch!

3961
02:13:24,800 --> 02:13:26,080
Okay, I need to find a snail.

3962
02:13:28,380 --> 02:13:32,440
Where the fuck are snails?

3963
02:13:33,040 --> 02:13:35,140
They don't deserve to live in the 80s.

3964
02:13:43,320 --> 02:13:44,280
Oh no.

3965
02:13:45,220 --> 02:13:46,980
I don't know where the snails are.

3966
02:13:48,200 --> 02:13:49,860
Don't keep toxic!

3967
02:13:51,100 --> 02:13:52,420
There's no more snails!

3968
02:13:52,440 --> 02:13:52,640
There is!

3969
02:13:53,960 --> 02:13:56,180
The fuck am I gonna survive?

3970
02:13:59,440 --> 02:14:04,000
I can only be alive when all the snails are dead in the 80s.

3971
02:14:04,380 --> 02:14:06,020
Guys, in the 80s.

3972
02:14:06,040 --> 02:14:07,700
Guys, have you guys seen any snails?

3973
02:14:07,720 --> 02:14:09,760
I fucking need some HP.

3974
02:14:10,520 --> 02:14:12,100
They're usually out in the forest.

3975
02:14:12,660 --> 02:14:13,140
Oh!

3976
02:14:14,940 --> 02:14:15,900
I see.

3977
02:14:16,300 --> 02:14:17,380
Oh, I found a shield repair.

3978
02:14:20,020 --> 02:14:20,980
Come drop me one.

3979
02:14:21,200 --> 02:14:21,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3980
02:14:24,120 --> 02:14:25,580
Only in the 80s, though, guys.

3981
02:14:25,680 --> 02:14:28,560
Only in the 80s when snail hate is relevant.

3982
02:14:29,140 --> 02:14:31,300
Here we go.

3983
02:14:32,540 --> 02:14:32,980
Nice.

3984
02:14:33,820 --> 02:14:36,180
Why didn't let me...

3985
02:14:36,640 --> 02:14:37,780
Oh, okay, I got it.

3986
02:14:39,540 --> 02:14:40,160
Let's get C.

3987
02:14:44,320 --> 02:14:45,200
Why snails?

3988
02:14:45,220 --> 02:14:46,920
Because you get your HP back from snails.

3989
02:14:47,060 --> 02:14:47,120
...

3990
02:14:47,120 --> 02:14:49,300
You're about to witness a heist so badass...

3991
02:14:49,300 --> 02:14:51,060
it'll be the stuff of legend.

3992
02:14:51,580 --> 02:14:53,700
Let's grab it before those other Tulses do.

3993
02:14:54,300 --> 02:14:55,600
Alright, where are you?

3994
02:14:55,800 --> 02:14:59,220
I really like... I really like this sniper.

3995
02:14:59,440 --> 02:15:02,180
All the other snipers were bad except for this one sniper.

3996
02:15:03,900 --> 02:15:06,960
I don't know how Oreo Coca Cola can taste like.

3997
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:07,540
Ah, fuck!

3998
02:15:08,120 --> 02:15:10,600
Is this an American thing, chat?

3999
02:15:10,840 --> 02:15:11,300
Is it just vanilla?

4000
02:15:12,860 --> 02:15:15,500
I've never heard about但是 Oreo.

4001
02:15:15,640 --> 02:15:18,140
Is that an American thing?

4002
02:15:18,360 --> 02:15:19,300
It just tastes like Oreo.

4003
02:15:19,340 --> 02:15:19,740
Yes?

4004
02:15:19,780 --> 02:15:20,560
Okay, no wonder.

4005
02:15:20,700 --> 02:15:22,260
Yeah, it seemed like an American thing.

4006
02:15:22,340 --> 02:15:25,060
I was like, I've never heard of Oreo Coca-Cola.

4007
02:15:25,320 --> 02:15:26,120
It's so good.

4008
02:15:26,700 --> 02:15:28,180
It sounds so American.

4009
02:15:28,520 --> 02:15:29,240
It does.

4010
02:15:29,580 --> 02:15:29,640
Oh!

4011
02:15:30,060 --> 02:15:30,720
Got me!

4012
02:15:31,020 --> 02:15:32,840
Chat, I am looking at you right now.

4013
02:15:32,980 --> 02:15:34,180
I stand my ground.

4014
02:15:34,260 --> 02:15:34,740
It's so good.

4015
02:15:34,840 --> 02:15:35,160
Stream sniper!

4016
02:15:40,560 --> 02:15:42,120
I can't believe it!

4017
02:15:42,140 --> 02:15:43,480
My dev stream snipes!

4018
02:15:43,480 --> 02:15:44,140
What about it?

4019
02:15:44,220 --> 02:15:44,340
You're lying.

4020
02:15:51,320 --> 02:15:52,040
The integrity!

4021
02:15:56,340 --> 02:15:58,040
Oh, I hit someone up in a door over here.

4022
02:15:58,860 --> 02:16:01,640
Yeah, there was like a guy next to me earlier, but he's gone.

4023
02:16:02,580 --> 02:16:05,280
You like how he got quiet the moment I yelled stream sniper?

4024
02:16:05,900 --> 02:16:06,860
Okay, he's right here.

4025
02:16:06,960 --> 02:16:08,160
People probably come here to fight him.

4026
02:16:13,560 --> 02:16:16,840
My favorite dev is a stream sniper.

4027
02:16:17,980 --> 02:16:18,620
Let's go!

4028
02:16:19,700 --> 02:16:21,800
Where is everybody?

4029
02:16:22,300 --> 02:16:23,300
How did they all die?

4030
02:16:25,020 --> 02:16:26,980
Frog, are you still in here?

4031
02:16:27,460 --> 02:16:28,360
What is that?

4032
02:16:29,460 --> 02:16:30,540
Oh, shit!

4033
02:16:30,600 --> 02:16:30,900
They're on me!

4034
02:16:32,120 --> 02:16:32,820
What, what, what?

4035
02:16:33,220 --> 02:16:34,160
They're on a car!

4036
02:16:34,440 --> 02:16:35,840
On me?

4037
02:16:35,920 --> 02:16:38,180
She's like a million miles above ground?

4038
02:16:38,400 --> 02:16:38,900
It's okay.

4039
02:16:39,080 --> 02:16:40,120
You guys are fine.

4040
02:16:40,320 --> 02:16:41,860
They're just chilling over there.

4041
02:16:42,600 --> 02:16:43,480
They're so far.

4042
02:16:43,680 --> 02:16:44,400
What is this?

4043
02:16:45,600 --> 02:16:47,200
There's something going on down here, man.

4044
02:16:47,300 --> 02:16:48,840
There's like a pod in the floor.

4045
02:16:49,060 --> 02:16:50,340
Oh, it's like an airdrop.

4046
02:16:50,420 --> 02:16:53,680
So it's gonna have like good material in it.

4047
02:16:54,460 --> 02:16:55,360
Oh, I see.

4048
02:16:56,780 --> 02:16:58,500
They're fighting to my left.

4049
02:16:59,320 --> 02:17:00,600
I see them on the roof.

4050
02:17:05,400 --> 02:17:07,260
Everybody in your team is dead?

4051
02:17:07,440 --> 02:17:08,840
Is your team just out?

4052
02:17:12,680 --> 02:17:14,300
Um, if everyone's got no lives, yeah.

4053
02:17:14,680 --> 02:17:15,340
Oh, okay.

4054
02:17:16,180 --> 02:17:18,960
Um, but you can actually resurrect teammates if they run out of lives.

4055
02:17:19,260 --> 02:17:19,720
Oh, okay.

4056
02:17:20,940 --> 02:17:21,360
Yeah, yeah.

4057
02:17:21,400 --> 02:17:22,340
Did she not do that?

4058
02:17:22,400 --> 02:17:22,960
Yeah, I did that.

4059
02:17:23,120 --> 02:17:23,480
I did that.

4060
02:17:23,480 --> 02:17:23,740
Oh, yeah.

4061
02:17:23,740 --> 02:17:24,080
You can do that.

4062
02:17:27,580 --> 02:17:31,280
They're all in there, but the pod... the C is over here, though.

4063
02:17:31,440 --> 02:17:35,880
I think they're just like bumping into each other and like tunneling on trying to kill each other.

4064
02:17:36,540 --> 02:17:38,380
Biocore C is 50% complete.

4065
02:17:40,180 --> 02:17:41,400
Hope they don't come near me.

4066
02:17:44,320 --> 02:17:45,480
I don't see nobody.

4067
02:17:46,200 --> 02:17:48,140
Dude, I am straight up doo-doo butter.

4068
02:17:48,400 --> 02:17:48,820
Oh, no.

4069
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:49,440
On me.

4070
02:17:50,300 --> 02:17:51,260
Coming, coming, coming, coming.

4071
02:17:51,820 --> 02:17:52,540
Oh, cracked.

4072
02:17:53,380 --> 02:17:53,980
He's inside?

4073
02:17:54,120 --> 02:17:54,300
Alright.

4074
02:17:56,380 --> 02:17:57,100
Are you guys okay?

4075
02:17:57,400 --> 02:17:59,700
Because I'm looking at this other team right now.

4076
02:18:01,420 --> 02:18:02,420
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.

4077
02:18:02,560 --> 02:18:03,100
It's Kuzai.

4078
02:18:03,160 --> 02:18:03,620
Got a heal in it.

4079
02:18:04,320 --> 02:18:06,040
Oh, he's so fucking weak right now.

4080
02:18:06,160 --> 02:18:06,240
Get him.

4081
02:18:06,360 --> 02:18:06,700
Get him.

4082
02:18:07,860 --> 02:18:09,280
I'm guarding the roofs.

4083
02:18:10,340 --> 02:18:11,320
I'm coming for you, bitch!

4084
02:18:11,380 --> 02:18:11,520
Ah!

4085
02:18:11,560 --> 02:18:12,140
He's... I...

4086
02:18:12,340 --> 02:18:12,460
Oh, shit.

4087
02:18:12,600 --> 02:18:13,100
He's got more shells.

4088
02:18:13,120 --> 02:18:13,280
Fuck.

4089
02:18:16,880 --> 02:18:17,400
Oh!

4090
02:18:19,160 --> 02:18:20,120
Oh, I got him.

4091
02:18:20,120 --> 02:18:20,920
Get... Fuck, Kuzai!

4092
02:18:21,100 --> 02:18:22,900
Go back to the fucking lobby, you bitch!

4093
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:26,080
I have people... below me.

4094
02:18:27,660 --> 02:18:28,980
Oh, I have the Biocore.

4095
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:31,960
I'm covering.

4096
02:18:33,020 --> 02:18:33,860
Sit, sit, sit.

4097
02:18:35,580 --> 02:18:37,380
I'm covering you over here.

4098
02:18:37,860 --> 02:18:39,540
I don't see nobody right now.

4099
02:18:40,340 --> 02:18:41,480
See, I'm going that way.

4100
02:18:43,360 --> 02:18:46,340
Yeah, I saw like a team here, but I don't see them right now.

4101
02:18:46,520 --> 02:18:47,420
Oh, there they are.

4102
02:18:49,280 --> 02:18:49,840
Oh, shit.

4103
02:18:49,940 --> 02:18:50,280
The reload.

4104
02:18:50,620 --> 02:18:51,380
No, no.

4105
02:18:52,360 --> 02:18:52,720
Oh,

4106
02:18:55,880 --> 02:18:56,180
they're on.

4107
02:19:01,600 --> 02:19:02,320
Sniper douchebag.

4108
02:19:02,420 --> 02:19:02,980
Come on!

4109
02:19:03,400 --> 02:19:03,980
Sniper off!

4110
02:19:04,080 --> 02:19:04,720
He's sniper.

4111
02:19:05,040 --> 02:19:05,540
Over me, dudes.

4112
02:19:06,860 --> 02:19:07,320
Wait, he...

4113
02:19:07,320 --> 02:19:08,220
He don't got that nog on him.

4114
02:19:08,600 --> 02:19:09,380
Wait, he left.

4115
02:19:09,480 --> 02:19:10,220
The sniper fight.

4116
02:19:12,400 --> 02:19:13,920
Why did you leave the sniper fight?

4117
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:15,060
You fucking cowards!

4118
02:19:18,460 --> 02:19:19,420
Look, he ran away!

4119
02:19:20,940 --> 02:19:22,320
Chase him down, chase him down, I believe.

4120
02:19:23,260 --> 02:19:25,000
Wait, there's falloff?

4121
02:19:27,240 --> 02:19:27,740
Oh shit.

4122
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:29,880
Okay, now I'm dead.

4123
02:19:30,040 --> 02:19:30,320
I need to run.

4124
02:19:35,120 --> 02:19:36,400
Wait, is there falloff?

4125
02:19:37,500 --> 02:19:39,960
Yeah, yeah, there's drop- Noooo!

4126
02:19:40,320 --> 02:19:41,740
Yeah, there's bullet drop.

4127
02:19:42,180 --> 02:19:42,620
Noooo!

4128
02:19:42,900 --> 02:19:43,840
You should remove that.

4129
02:19:44,140 --> 02:19:48,960
That's my- That's my honest- So, no, no, no, no.

4130
02:19:49,020 --> 02:19:49,700
Hear me out.

4131
02:19:49,820 --> 02:19:52,640
You can make a sniper that doesn't have any drop-off.

4132
02:19:52,740 --> 02:19:57,180
Oh, wait, how come this gun doesn't- How come this gun has drop-off?

4133
02:19:57,260 --> 02:20:00,880
I'm sorry, Doki, I can't- I can't bend the fucking knee!

4134
02:20:01,020 --> 02:20:01,200
What?

4135
02:20:01,320 --> 02:20:02,760
I can't give you anything!

4136
02:20:03,140 --> 02:20:03,160
You're a dumb!

4137
02:20:03,540 --> 02:20:05,400
You said this was a cheat code!

4138
02:20:06,200 --> 02:20:07,720
I gave you a cheat code!

4139
02:20:07,860 --> 02:20:10,580
I've used everything in my power to build that motherfucker!

4140
02:20:10,860 --> 02:20:12,680
And you're like- He has to give me more!

4141
02:20:12,840 --> 02:20:13,740
What more do you need?

4142
02:20:14,700 --> 02:20:15,500
No drop-off?

4143
02:20:17,940 --> 02:20:19,500
I just want one thing.

4144
02:20:19,580 --> 02:20:20,680
That's really it.

4145
02:20:22,400 --> 02:20:24,700
You just want the- I just want the moon!

4146
02:20:24,940 --> 02:20:25,800
Can you give me the moon?

4147
02:20:27,100 --> 02:20:28,800
Hey, I'm the invited guest.

4148
02:20:33,380 --> 02:20:34,700
There's people here.

4149
02:20:38,080 --> 02:20:41,120
Use my beautiful dev creation to kill this guy.

4150
02:20:41,120 --> 02:20:42,200
Yeah, yeah!

4151
02:20:47,720 --> 02:20:49,340
You're getting clapped in the cheeks!

4152
02:20:49,700 --> 02:20:51,760
Wait, wait, people are on you?

4153
02:20:51,900 --> 02:20:53,280
Oh shit, okay, I'm heading back.

4154
02:20:53,740 --> 02:20:56,560
Okay, I'm like 200 meters away.

4155
02:20:56,680 --> 02:20:57,620
I'll be there soon.

4156
02:20:58,340 --> 02:20:58,860
Soon?

4157
02:21:00,860 --> 02:21:02,640
I'm 200 meters away.

4158
02:21:02,740 --> 02:21:03,360
I'll be there.

4159
02:21:05,080 --> 02:21:06,760
Wait, how is there people there?

4160
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:09,120
They walked there!

4161
02:21:09,180 --> 02:21:09,920
They used their legs!

4162
02:21:10,380 --> 02:21:11,240
That's not a thing.

4163
02:21:11,460 --> 02:21:12,500
I got it, I got it, I got it!

4164
02:21:12,600 --> 02:21:13,360
I'm coming over.

4165
02:21:15,080 --> 02:21:16,100
I'm almost there.

4166
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,320
I'm 100 meters- I'm 170 meters.

4167
02:21:19,680 --> 02:21:21,060
I killed everyone, let's fucking go!

4168
02:21:21,200 --> 02:21:21,540
Let's go!

4169
02:21:23,720 --> 02:21:25,480
Guys, I'm almost- don't worry, 135.

4170
02:21:28,460 --> 02:21:30,840
See, WK just enabled them cheats, don't worry about it.

4171
02:21:30,860 --> 02:21:31,300
Yeah, see?

4172
02:21:31,760 --> 02:21:32,160
See?

4173
02:21:32,260 --> 02:21:35,160
If Ico can do it, like, I don't understand why.

4174
02:21:35,480 --> 02:21:36,640
This other dev, cool.

4175
02:21:36,820 --> 02:21:37,420
One of them?

4176
02:21:37,740 --> 02:21:38,620
One of them?

4177
02:21:42,360 --> 02:21:42,820
Oh, hey.

4178
02:21:46,100 --> 02:21:47,000
Oh, he's scared.

4179
02:21:47,260 --> 02:21:48,180
There's a guy near me.

4180
02:21:48,460 --> 02:21:49,180
But he ran.

4181
02:21:50,620 --> 02:21:51,220
Oh, he's up here?

4182
02:21:53,160 --> 02:21:53,680
Got him.

4183
02:21:54,140 --> 02:21:54,480
Nice.

4184
02:21:55,820 --> 02:21:57,060
How are you still- okay, there you go.

4185
02:21:57,080 --> 02:21:57,440
Oh my god, it got me!

4186
02:21:57,440 --> 02:21:58,760
How are you still alive, bro?

4187
02:21:59,860 --> 02:22:00,940
Wait, I'm heading over.

4188
02:22:02,440 --> 02:22:03,160
We did it!

4189
02:22:05,140 --> 02:22:06,040
Did we win?

4190
02:22:06,260 --> 02:22:06,700
We were on fire.

4191
02:22:07,440 --> 02:22:08,280
Hell yeah, we did.

4192
02:22:08,780 --> 02:22:09,700
Yeah, you know what?

4193
02:22:09,740 --> 02:22:12,680
We didn't win, no thanks to my shitty sniper rifle, apparently.

4194
02:22:13,380 --> 02:22:16,140
Yeah, I mean, that's why I had my sniper rifle.

4195
02:22:17,100 --> 02:22:18,600
That is my sniper rifle!

4196
02:22:18,740 --> 02:22:19,800
No, it's in my hands.

4197
02:22:19,920 --> 02:22:20,960
I don't know about that.

4198
02:22:23,480 --> 02:22:25,000
It is in my hands.

4199
02:22:26,180 --> 02:22:27,400
Oh, god, dude.

4200
02:22:30,280 --> 02:22:33,800
This whole stream- this whole play to do this is an absolute whiplash.

4201
02:22:37,520 --> 02:22:38,400
This whole stream- this whole play to do this is an absolute whiplash.

4202
02:22:39,040 --> 02:22:40,680
I made this.

4203
02:22:40,680 --> 02:22:44,180
Do you have the do not return list, Iko?

4204
02:22:46,600 --> 02:22:47,120
Huh?

4205
02:22:47,640 --> 02:22:49,720
Do you have the do not return list?

4206
02:22:50,960 --> 02:22:54,480
Yeah, I'll put Doki and Big Ball Lettuce right along the top.

4207
02:22:54,800 --> 02:22:54,820
Oh, shit.

4208
02:22:58,060 --> 02:23:02,920
Iko, you didn't kill me without going down.

4209
02:23:03,040 --> 02:23:03,460
Get owned.

4210
02:23:04,880 --> 02:23:05,840
Did I win?

4211
02:23:07,880 --> 02:23:08,700
I don't know, did you?

4212
02:23:08,800 --> 02:23:09,740
I don't buy a dungeon, do I?

4213
02:23:10,260 --> 02:23:11,020
I don't buy a dungeon.

4214
02:23:11,180 --> 02:23:11,520
It's too late.

4215
02:23:11,640 --> 02:23:13,360
I already got in on the first day.

4216
02:23:13,400 --> 02:23:14,260
It's too late already.

4217
02:23:16,960 --> 02:23:17,280
Guys!

4218
02:23:22,140 --> 02:23:22,740
Look at me!

4219
02:23:23,160 --> 02:23:25,320
I got more damage than the dev!

4220
02:23:28,580 --> 02:23:30,600
Iko, you got downed by Connie's Nightmare, okay?

4221
02:23:30,760 --> 02:23:31,060
So...

4222
02:23:31,920 --> 02:23:32,560
By what?

4223
02:23:32,660 --> 02:23:33,200
Look at me!

4224
02:23:33,280 --> 02:23:33,840
Connie's Nightmare.

4225
02:23:33,860 --> 02:23:34,440
It's the name of the gun.

4226
02:23:34,440 --> 02:23:35,020
Is that what it's called?

4227
02:23:35,260 --> 02:23:35,920
That's what it's called.

4228
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:36,580
It's Connie's Nightmare.

4229
02:23:38,640 --> 02:23:40,980
Connie's Nightmare was me getting my hands on fire stuff.

4230
02:23:41,180 --> 02:23:42,340
No, that's not her Nightmare.

4231
02:23:42,340 --> 02:23:43,400
I know what her Nightmare is.

4232
02:23:43,400 --> 02:23:44,160
It's Hydration.

4233
02:23:44,380 --> 02:23:45,500
Because she never fucking hydrates.

4234
02:23:45,520 --> 02:23:46,540
No, it's Rocky.

4235
02:23:46,780 --> 02:23:48,380
Or whatever you lot call Rocky.

4236
02:23:49,660 --> 02:23:50,260
Vegetable stuff.

4237
02:23:50,320 --> 02:23:50,800
She told me.

4238
02:23:53,120 --> 02:23:56,300
After I told her it was me, she left for my Nightmare.

4239
02:23:56,400 --> 02:23:57,560
What do you mean, sir?

4240
02:23:57,860 --> 02:23:59,720
Thank you for the super chat.

4241
02:23:59,960 --> 02:24:01,380
Thank you, thank you.

4242
02:24:01,500 --> 02:24:02,680
Wait, Doki, did you not die?

4243
02:24:02,960 --> 02:24:03,380
No!

4244
02:24:03,380 --> 02:24:04,780
She didn't die once, no!

4245
02:24:04,780 --> 02:24:05,460
I was a gamer.

4246
02:24:06,760 --> 02:24:07,500
Hella gaming.

4247
02:24:07,760 --> 02:24:08,220
Yeah!

4248
02:24:08,800 --> 02:24:09,720
She had the power of...

4249
02:24:09,720 --> 02:24:12,120
I had, like, double Jedi's damage, too.

4250
02:24:14,900 --> 02:24:16,360
Showed anime and friendship.

4251
02:24:24,100 --> 02:24:25,380
So, GG's, everybody.

4252
02:24:25,580 --> 02:24:27,860
We're closing this motherfrigger off.

4253
02:24:28,320 --> 02:24:30,560
Thank you, everybody, for joining us today.

4254
02:24:30,680 --> 02:24:33,020
I hope y'all had just as much fun as I did.

4255
02:24:33,020 --> 02:24:34,060
Every single one of you.

4256
02:24:34,100 --> 02:24:34,660
But you had fun?

4257
02:24:35,540 --> 02:24:36,860
Yeah, I had so much fun.

4258
02:24:36,880 --> 02:24:37,340
See, guys?

4259
02:24:37,340 --> 02:24:38,120
He had fun!

4260
02:24:38,680 --> 02:24:40,400
I'm clenching my fist so hard right now.

4261
02:24:40,400 --> 02:24:41,320
Guys, I told you!

4262
02:24:41,480 --> 02:24:42,420
He had fun!

4263
02:24:43,240 --> 02:24:44,420
No, it really was fun.

4264
02:24:44,500 --> 02:24:45,380
Thank you so much, everybody.

4265
02:24:45,560 --> 02:24:46,780
This is a really big blast.

4266
02:24:46,940 --> 02:24:48,180
I hope everybody here...

4267
02:24:48,180 --> 02:24:52,300
What the fuck is... What the fu... I'm seeing some crazy shit right now on my screen.

4268
02:24:52,360 --> 02:24:52,900
See, guys?

4269
02:24:53,080 --> 02:24:54,020
He had fun!

4270
02:24:54,700 --> 02:24:55,600
Sorry about that.

4271
02:24:55,660 --> 02:24:56,560
Little ADHD moment.

4272
02:24:58,280 --> 02:25:01,360
But, so, things I want to quickly close out on is...

4273
02:25:01,360 --> 02:25:06,220
One, tomorrow is our technical... our closed technical test.

4274
02:25:06,460 --> 02:25:08,060
Anyone is welcome to join it.

4275
02:25:08,100 --> 02:25:10,040
There is a registration process to it.

4276
02:25:10,040 --> 02:25:11,500
As you can join the technical test tomorrow.

4277
02:25:11,500 --> 02:25:16,500
So, if you want to play the most recent version of Ascendant, which was quite literally finalized today...

4278
02:25:16,500 --> 02:25:17,760
Yeah, that's locked out from DevHack Hacking.

4279
02:25:17,760 --> 02:25:21,720
You're more than welcome to register for that, and you will get access to the game tomorrow.

4280
02:25:21,960 --> 02:25:25,320
And this includes anyone's community in here.

4281
02:25:25,480 --> 02:25:29,720
If you want to bring friends in, if you want to bring your community in, you're more than welcome to.

4282
02:25:29,760 --> 02:25:30,260
It's closed.

4283
02:25:30,260 --> 02:25:34,500
It's closed, but the reason why we're calling it closed is because if we get too much people in here, people are going to be like, this game's dick.

4284
02:25:34,560 --> 02:25:34,980
Oh, shit.

4285
02:25:35,060 --> 02:25:35,560
It's closed.

4286
02:25:35,820 --> 02:25:36,060
Okay.

4287
02:25:36,080 --> 02:25:37,880
So, we're looking for feedback.

4288
02:25:38,140 --> 02:25:41,960
We're looking to make things better for the game and for the community when we get closer to launch.

4289
02:25:42,120 --> 02:25:44,400
So, you're welcome to try it out tomorrow.

4290
02:25:44,660 --> 02:25:45,880
Big changes are happening.

4291
02:25:46,060 --> 02:25:52,220
So, second is we have a lot more stuff coming along the way in terms of events.

4292
02:25:52,480 --> 02:25:56,200
We do these things every week, and anyone's more than welcome to come back.

4293
02:25:56,340 --> 02:25:58,320
We'll happily pull you back in.

4294
02:25:58,340 --> 02:25:58,660
See?

4295
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:00,120
Anybody is welcome.

4296
02:26:00,120 --> 02:26:02,500
It's more than welcome to come back.

4297
02:26:03,100 --> 02:26:05,000
I'm not blacklisted.

4298
02:26:05,120 --> 02:26:07,560
If I was, he'd be like, accept no key.

4299
02:26:07,860 --> 02:26:13,280
I can't name everybody here, but for the most part, everyone here is a community member that supports these events like this.

4300
02:26:13,340 --> 02:26:19,640
So, if you want to try and, you know, take part in it, have some more fun, get to learn the game a little bit more, more than welcome to join us.

4301
02:26:20,240 --> 02:26:25,520
So, other than that, we have more events coming up, especially in the very, very close future.

4302
02:26:25,780 --> 02:26:30,100
I mentioned it earlier, but we're looking at ways that we can get more creator in.

4303
02:26:30,100 --> 02:26:31,720
We're looking at ways that we can get more events developed for the game.

4304
02:26:31,860 --> 02:26:34,140
So, think creator clans.

4305
02:26:34,320 --> 02:26:36,960
Think leaderboards for clans for those creators specifically.

4306
02:26:37,140 --> 02:26:38,640
Except in the fine print.

4307
02:26:39,760 --> 02:26:40,940
Except no key.

4308
02:26:41,840 --> 02:26:46,100
We're looking to see how we can get more of you into the game as well.

4309
02:26:46,340 --> 02:26:48,620
So, other than that, I have nothing else.

4310
02:26:48,940 --> 02:26:54,320
I know you had some more conversational stuff that you wanted to talk about, Metsu, so I'll stick around a little bit more.

4311
02:26:54,420 --> 02:26:58,340
But everybody else, the server should be up for, I think, the next 30 minutes.

4312
02:26:58,340 --> 02:27:04,340
So, you're more than welcome to hang around the lobby, play with some stuff, build a weapon out or two, test it out in 1v1 challenges.

4313
02:27:04,620 --> 02:27:05,640
You can do all of that.

4314
02:27:06,020 --> 02:27:09,060
And, yeah, other than that, thank you so much, everybody.

4315
02:27:09,360 --> 02:27:10,500
It really means a lot to us.

4316
02:27:10,820 --> 02:27:12,320
A hundred wins?!

4317
02:27:12,320 --> 02:27:14,620
Who the fuck is in this lobby?!

4318
02:27:15,200 --> 02:27:16,180
We won, though.

4319
02:27:16,420 --> 02:27:17,040
We won.

4320
02:27:17,220 --> 02:27:18,700
I had the main dev on my team.

4321
02:27:18,700 --> 02:27:20,620
Don't worry about the secret Raccoon devs.

4322
02:27:20,920 --> 02:27:21,640
That's a secret.

4323
02:27:21,960 --> 02:27:22,560
Oh, what?

4324
02:27:22,680 --> 02:27:23,360
There's a secret?

4325
02:27:25,160 --> 02:27:25,560
What?

4326
02:27:26,540 --> 02:27:27,460
Don't worry about it.

4327
02:27:27,460 --> 02:27:28,480
There's a secret?

4328
02:27:28,740 --> 02:27:30,300
Oh my god, I don't...

4329
02:27:34,680 --> 02:27:37,860
Guys, I got placed in the best team, guys.

4330
02:27:38,840 --> 02:27:41,600
Even with, like, a hundred wins.

4331
02:27:45,820 --> 02:27:49,720
Oh, I remember, so the last thing that we were talking about was...

4332
02:27:49,720 --> 02:27:50,600
Wait, is this over?

4333
02:27:50,960 --> 02:27:52,240
Like, the...

4334
02:27:52,240 --> 02:27:55,740
Oh, she's a dragon!

4335
02:27:57,460 --> 02:28:00,200
I don't understand, like, what was the victory aspect, because there's no...

4336
02:28:00,660 --> 02:28:03,540
For example, in Battle Royale's...

4337
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:04,420
Guys, we won.

4338
02:28:04,600 --> 02:28:05,360
...traditional last-minute...

4339
02:28:05,360 --> 02:28:06,740
They might have a hundred wins, but we won.

4340
02:28:06,740 --> 02:28:09,920
...extraction shooters is that there's no real victory other than...

4341
02:28:09,920 --> 02:28:10,240
We won, guys.

4342
02:28:10,260 --> 02:28:12,080
...grabbing the shit that you want and leaving, right?

4343
02:28:12,220 --> 02:28:16,240
So with this, it being presented as Capture the Flag...

4344
02:28:18,360 --> 02:28:19,480
What is that?!

4345
02:28:19,480 --> 02:28:22,180
It's equivalent to Capture the Flag, but the...

4346
02:28:23,700 --> 02:28:24,860
How can I put it?

4347
02:28:25,080 --> 02:28:26,080
Why is this interacting?

4348
02:28:26,700 --> 02:28:29,060
Like, there's no, like, actual, like, victory...

4349
02:28:29,060 --> 02:28:29,560
Oh, what the fuck is that?!

4350
02:28:29,560 --> 02:28:30,220
...status thing.

4351
02:28:30,400 --> 02:28:34,020
That was kind of, like, throwing me off, because I'm trying to play in the sense of...

4352
02:28:34,020 --> 02:28:34,040
I can't even get there!

4353
02:28:34,040 --> 02:28:34,540
I'm just opening the door!

4354
02:28:34,540 --> 02:28:39,060
...all of us are competing to have, like, a victory screen, when in reality, we're just all competing to...

4355
02:28:39,060 --> 02:28:42,040
Like, I can't even get there, I'm just opening the door.

4356
02:28:42,520 --> 02:28:42,540
...get the only course that I can grab.

4357
02:28:43,400 --> 02:28:45,240
It's a door that I cannot reach.

4358
02:28:45,300 --> 02:28:46,560
But yeah, with ranked, I was thinking about...

4359
02:28:46,560 --> 02:28:49,120
Can I... I don't know if I... I need to listen to this.

4360
02:28:49,120 --> 02:28:54,360
...with the different tiers that you were talking about, if... within, like, a specific...

4361
02:28:55,260 --> 02:28:56,060
The Elevator.

4362
02:28:56,060 --> 02:28:56,340
The Elevator?

4363
02:28:56,460 --> 02:28:57,820
No, I can't reach down there.

4364
02:28:57,940 --> 02:29:02,000
I wouldn't know how to put it off, because if a team is just going ham and getting three cores, right?

4365
02:29:02,080 --> 02:29:03,740
But it's a big door!

4366
02:29:04,060 --> 02:29:06,960
Another team that isn't as good, when that other team gets off, even if they get one...

4367
02:29:06,960 --> 02:29:08,040
Look at that big door that we can't reach!

4368
02:29:08,040 --> 02:29:11,960
...everybody's eventually gonna hit, say, if, you know, it's, like, 50 cores for the day.

4369
02:29:12,060 --> 02:29:13,740
So I was just trying to figure out, like...

4370
02:29:13,740 --> 02:29:14,420
I guess we'll call it here.

4371
02:29:14,480 --> 02:29:17,280
How could you get around that?

4372
02:29:17,280 --> 02:29:19,060
I don't know, everybody is still here.

4373
02:29:19,360 --> 02:29:24,280
It's kind of... I don't want to make any comparisons and say that this is exactly how it's going to work.

4374
02:29:24,400 --> 02:29:24,740
But...

4375
02:29:24,740 --> 02:29:25,060
Right, right.

4376
02:29:25,060 --> 02:29:26,380
I think a good...

4377
02:29:26,940 --> 02:29:27,780
I feel weird.

4378
02:29:27,780 --> 02:29:29,000
Everybody is still here.

4379
02:29:29,440 --> 02:29:30,220
I want to say...

4380
02:29:31,540 --> 02:29:33,600
A very, very different game, right?

4381
02:29:33,720 --> 02:29:39,640
But the way that their ranking works is all about performance within those specific roles that you have.

4382
02:29:39,800 --> 02:29:41,160
Now, there's no roles in here, but...

4383
02:29:41,160 --> 02:29:41,940
What's Q&A?

4384
02:29:42,080 --> 02:29:44,040
Guys, what kind of questions do you guys have?

4385
02:29:44,300 --> 02:29:44,740
Wait!

4386
02:29:44,880 --> 02:29:45,780
Is this...

4387
02:29:45,780 --> 02:29:46,040
No!

4388
02:29:46,280 --> 02:29:47,800
...any game that we play in today.

4389
02:29:48,420 --> 02:29:50,060
So you're gonna have your ranked tiers...

4390
02:29:50,060 --> 02:29:50,980
Sorry, just really quickly, Jade.

4391
02:29:51,260 --> 02:29:51,840
Yeah, what's up?

4392
02:29:53,040 --> 02:29:55,040
If you guys have places to be created, don't worry about it.

4393
02:29:55,040 --> 02:29:56,020
You don't have to stick around.

4394
02:29:56,220 --> 02:29:56,960
I can just see chat.

4395
02:29:58,120 --> 02:29:59,260
Talking about DokiMiki.

4396
02:29:59,440 --> 02:29:59,900
It's okay.

4397
02:30:00,340 --> 02:30:01,180
We're just chatting now.

4398
02:30:02,140 --> 02:30:02,760
Oh, okay.

4399
02:30:03,900 --> 02:30:04,300
Nice.

4400
02:30:04,500 --> 02:30:05,540
Guys, we can leave.

4401
02:30:06,020 --> 02:30:07,020
Don't worry about it!

4402
02:30:07,320 --> 02:30:08,960
We have permission to leave!

4403
02:30:09,460 --> 02:30:09,860
Anyway...

4404
02:30:09,860 --> 02:30:11,480
The test is over, don't worry.

4405
02:30:11,660 --> 02:30:12,380
Okay, okay.

4406
02:30:12,520 --> 02:30:12,920
So...

4407
02:30:13,380 --> 02:30:16,020
Yeah, the way that's gonna work is that you...

4408
02:30:16,020 --> 02:30:16,440
The way that's gonna work is that you...

4409
02:30:16,440 --> 02:30:16,700
Yeah, the way that's gonna work is that you...

4410
02:30:16,700 --> 02:30:18,380
No, this L-Painting can only go up!

4411
02:30:18,380 --> 02:30:20,880
Your performance is going to matter in every single game that you play.

4412
02:30:21,020 --> 02:30:22,120
So, rank...

4413
02:30:22,120 --> 02:30:23,720
This can only go up!

4414
02:30:23,760 --> 02:30:23,820
Just because you grabbed Bio 4...

4415
02:30:23,820 --> 02:30:26,320
But you've got zero overall score.

4416
02:30:26,620 --> 02:30:28,240
Like, you didn't really contribute to the team.

4417
02:30:28,700 --> 02:30:30,380
You did get a Bio Core.

4418
02:30:30,460 --> 02:30:32,300
You are walking out with a Bio Core, even in that rank match.

4419
02:30:32,300 --> 02:30:32,640
I contributed.

4420
02:30:33,200 --> 02:30:34,440
But you're not...

4421
02:30:34,440 --> 02:30:36,960
Are we legally allowed to leave the class now?

4422
02:30:37,720 --> 02:30:39,320
Professor, it's...

4423
02:30:39,820 --> 02:30:40,300
Class...

4424
02:30:40,820 --> 02:30:42,380
Class is supposed to end at 3.

4425
02:30:42,440 --> 02:30:44,040
Are we legally allowed to leave?

4426
02:30:44,040 --> 02:30:45,880
Or do we have to stick for the Q&A?

4427
02:30:46,560 --> 02:30:50,460
Can you ask if they can make the elevators go down?

4428
02:30:50,460 --> 02:30:52,800
I would say the only thing that's gonna...

4429
02:30:53,820 --> 02:30:58,280
Probably be hated, but what we do want to try is allowing mixed ranks.

4430
02:30:58,280 --> 02:31:00,560
Okay, we're just gonna leave the class, I guess, now.

4431
02:31:01,140 --> 02:31:01,720
...within these matches.

4432
02:31:03,780 --> 02:31:04,840
I don't know!

4433
02:31:05,380 --> 02:31:07,520
I don't know if you guys had any questions.

4434
02:31:07,680 --> 02:31:08,840
I didn't have any questions.

4435
02:31:08,940 --> 02:31:09,440
It's just...

4436
02:31:09,440 --> 02:31:10,640
It's a technical test.

4437
02:31:10,940 --> 02:31:13,840
Like, as long as the game is fun, that's all I care about.

4438
02:31:14,220 --> 02:31:14,660
Like...

4439
02:31:17,120 --> 02:31:18,000
I just...

4440
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:19,980
As long as the game is fun.

4441
02:31:20,040 --> 02:31:22,640
And if the game's fun, that's all I care about.

4442
02:31:22,640 --> 02:31:30,220
It was technical stuff, so I was like, well, they were talking about matchmaking.

4443
02:31:32,400 --> 02:31:34,340
I mean, it's a technical test.

4444
02:31:34,600 --> 02:31:38,220
I'm pretty sure there's going to be other updates and stuff going on, too.

4445
02:31:39,120 --> 02:31:40,860
Oh yeah, by the way, guys.

4446
02:31:41,840 --> 02:31:50,600
By the way, for those who were not a member goon, I'm having some new updates for you guys to show you guys.

4447
02:31:50,660 --> 02:31:51,100
Watch this.

4448
02:31:51,100 --> 02:31:54,480
So as you guys all know, I have glasses now.

4449
02:31:54,760 --> 02:31:55,300
Yeah.

4450
02:31:55,540 --> 02:32:02,180
But like, what I didn't show you guys for the public streams was...

4451
02:32:10,500 --> 02:32:12,240
So yeah, like, that's what I...

4452
02:32:15,200 --> 02:32:23,080
So this is like a new update on the skin suit, so I can easily go.

4453
02:32:28,480 --> 02:32:30,220
Wait, maybe I have a green screen.

4454
02:32:30,480 --> 02:32:30,760
Okay.

4455
02:32:30,860 --> 02:32:32,640
Sorry, my magenta screen.

4456
02:32:36,760 --> 02:32:42,800
So I have that now.

4457
02:32:43,160 --> 02:32:49,560
And also, if you guys didn't know, you might have seen this.

4458
02:32:49,680 --> 02:32:51,420
You might have seen this before.

4459
02:32:51,500 --> 02:32:53,540
But basically, when my...

4460
02:32:53,540 --> 02:32:57,000
The tomato is out of the skin suit, this is what happens.

4461
02:33:04,650 --> 02:33:06,010
So yeah, like...

4462
02:33:09,010 --> 02:33:14,270
So, you know, if I have to use the bathroom or anything...

4463
02:33:15,170 --> 02:33:19,610
If I have to use the bathroom and I, you know, the tomato is out of the suit...

4464
02:33:29,680 --> 02:33:30,080
I can use the bathroom instead.

4465
02:33:31,500 --> 02:33:33,060
So it's loading...

4466
02:33:33,060 --> 02:33:36,300
We're loading right now.

4467
02:33:36,860 --> 02:33:37,260
Um...

4468
02:33:37,260 --> 02:33:39,220
But yeah, anyway, those are the updates.

4469
02:33:39,300 --> 02:33:43,560
I was gonna show you guys the updates in the beginning of the stream but then I didn't do my homework going in.

4470
02:33:43,800 --> 02:33:44,880
I hope they...

4471
02:33:44,880 --> 02:33:47,440
I hope the devs still have fun with me.

4472
02:33:47,460 --> 02:33:48,980
I was so unprepared, I...

4473
02:33:48,980 --> 02:33:49,860
I literally...

4474
02:33:49,860 --> 02:33:52,440
They were like, here's the key to the game.

4475
02:33:52,560 --> 02:33:53,360
And I was like, sweet.

4476
02:33:53,360 --> 02:33:56,080
And then just show up at like 6 p.m.

4477
02:33:56,240 --> 02:33:57,060
And I was like, okay.

4478
02:33:59,040 --> 02:34:00,300
I didn't realize.

4479
02:34:00,400 --> 02:34:01,300
I was like, I had...

4480
02:34:01,300 --> 02:34:02,200
There's homework?

4481
02:34:06,480 --> 02:34:11,140
But yeah, thank you to the devs for inviting me.

4482
02:34:13,640 --> 02:34:16,600
And for letting me try Ascendant.

4483
02:34:16,600 --> 02:34:17,120
It was pretty fun.

4484
02:34:17,460 --> 02:34:21,540
I had a really great time getting cheat codes from the devs too.

4485
02:34:21,860 --> 02:34:22,760
Thoughts on the movement?

4486
02:34:22,760 --> 02:34:25,220
I feel like...

4487
02:34:26,480 --> 02:34:27,360
There was...

4488
02:34:27,360 --> 02:34:29,880
I think the slide definitely needs a little bit of work.

4489
02:34:30,320 --> 02:34:31,640
I don't know if it was ping.

4490
02:34:31,780 --> 02:34:32,920
I don't know what server it was.

4491
02:34:33,020 --> 02:34:33,580
I didn't know...

4492
02:34:33,580 --> 02:34:37,220
I didn't know like what server we were on.

4493
02:34:37,380 --> 02:34:38,540
What region it was.

4494
02:34:38,800 --> 02:34:40,100
But it did feel...

4495
02:34:40,100 --> 02:34:42,580
The movement feels just a little bit stiff.

4496
02:34:43,300 --> 02:34:44,860
Because I was...

4497
02:34:44,860 --> 02:34:45,820
I don't know if you guys saw it.

4498
02:34:45,860 --> 02:34:47,260
But at some moments like...

4499
02:34:47,260 --> 02:34:50,080
I don't know if it's the slide or it was my ping.

4500
02:34:50,420 --> 02:34:51,180
But yeah.

4501
02:34:51,400 --> 02:34:52,340
Also like...

4502
02:34:52,760 --> 02:34:54,060
The fact that like...

4503
02:34:54,060 --> 02:34:54,860
Oh my god.

4504
02:34:54,940 --> 02:34:59,000
Like when you have like an actual overpowered gun in your hands.

4505
02:34:59,080 --> 02:35:01,220
The other guns like just doesn't compare.

4506
02:35:01,480 --> 02:35:02,100
Because I was like wondering.

4507
02:35:02,160 --> 02:35:03,420
I was like why does my sniper do...

4508
02:35:03,420 --> 02:35:09,120
I was like wondering why does my guns do so little damage compared to like other people's guns.

4509
02:35:09,360 --> 02:35:10,020
And then I realized.

4510
02:35:10,200 --> 02:35:11,960
Oh they had custom guns.

4511
02:35:12,220 --> 02:35:13,080
Like I was like...

4512
02:35:13,080 --> 02:35:14,300
I was like there's no way.

4513
02:35:14,400 --> 02:35:15,200
I was like how...

4514
02:35:15,200 --> 02:35:16,820
Is there shots hitting me more?

4515
02:35:17,140 --> 02:35:17,620
Yeah.

4516
02:35:18,540 --> 02:35:19,580
I was like...

4517
02:35:19,580 --> 02:35:20,280
And I was like...

4518
02:35:20,280 --> 02:35:22,520
Oh it's the fucking custom guns.

4519
02:35:22,960 --> 02:35:24,620
Like the crafted guns.

4520
02:35:24,960 --> 02:35:27,600
And they had like so much time in the game.

4521
02:35:27,900 --> 02:35:30,020
So they obviously they have crafted guns.

4522
02:35:30,220 --> 02:35:31,160
So the moment...

4523
02:35:32,680 --> 02:35:34,780
The moment I got a real gun.

4524
02:35:35,060 --> 02:35:37,780
Like the moment I had a real gun in my hands.

4525
02:35:37,980 --> 02:35:39,440
I was like it's over for you guys.

4526
02:35:39,700 --> 02:35:40,980
It's fucking over.

4527
02:35:43,760 --> 02:35:45,120
I was like...

4528
02:35:45,120 --> 02:35:45,880
You're going...

4529
02:35:45,880 --> 02:35:46,620
Yeah it's over.

4530
02:35:46,720 --> 02:35:47,540
You're going down.

4531
02:35:47,860 --> 02:35:49,460
I have a fucking crafted gun.

4532
02:35:50,800 --> 02:35:52,080
I didn't like...

4533
02:35:52,080 --> 02:35:54,340
The one thing I really didn't like though was...

4534
02:35:55,260 --> 02:35:57,840
You can't swap your gun when you're reloading.

4535
02:35:57,900 --> 02:35:58,400
I don't know.

4536
02:35:58,500 --> 02:36:00,160
I don't know if I fucked it up.

4537
02:36:00,280 --> 02:36:03,240
But like when I was doing that 1v1 against that other guy.

4538
02:36:03,400 --> 02:36:04,780
And I tried to swap to my pistol.

4539
02:36:05,040 --> 02:36:07,240
I was reloading my shotgun.

4540
02:36:07,400 --> 02:36:10,200
And I had to wait until my shotgun finished reloading.

4541
02:36:10,380 --> 02:36:12,960
And then swap to the pistol.

4542
02:36:13,360 --> 02:36:14,840
Like I don't know if I had to cancel.

4543
02:36:15,140 --> 02:36:17,520
I think maybe I had to melee cancel.

4544
02:36:18,760 --> 02:36:19,640
But like...

4545
02:36:21,100 --> 02:36:23,140
I would definitely like to swap my gun.

4546
02:36:23,380 --> 02:36:24,920
If I want to like...

4547
02:36:24,920 --> 02:36:28,800
I don't want to cancel my reloading by just swapping my gun.

4548
02:36:28,980 --> 02:36:30,740
But I might have had to melee cancel.

4549
02:36:32,680 --> 02:36:34,080
I'm not used to...

4550
02:36:35,280 --> 02:36:36,880
I'm not used to like...

4551
02:36:36,880 --> 02:36:37,500
Swap...

4552
02:36:37,500 --> 02:36:38,720
Melee cancel the swap.

4553
02:36:39,620 --> 02:36:41,040
But yeah like...

4554
02:36:41,040 --> 02:36:43,220
That was the one thing I really didn't like.

4555
02:36:43,580 --> 02:36:46,340
I was locked into the reload animation.

4556
02:36:46,960 --> 02:36:48,260
Because I was trying to like...

4557
02:36:48,260 --> 02:36:49,120
Because I just realized...

4558
02:36:49,120 --> 02:36:49,940
Oh I should swap my pistol.

4559
02:36:50,220 --> 02:36:51,620
But I already reloaded my shotgun.

4560
02:36:51,740 --> 02:36:53,000
But other than that it was really fun.

4561
02:36:53,360 --> 02:36:54,680
Learning the mechanics.

4562
02:36:55,240 --> 02:36:56,580
Because it was like...

4563
02:36:56,580 --> 02:36:58,160
It was basically capture the flag.

4564
02:36:58,480 --> 02:37:00,340
And then the environment stuff.

4565
02:37:00,680 --> 02:37:01,460
The snail...

4566
02:37:01,460 --> 02:37:03,140
The environment stuff.

4567
02:37:04,400 --> 02:37:04,960
So...

4568
02:37:05,580 --> 02:37:06,840
It was pretty fun.

4569
02:37:07,080 --> 02:37:08,800
Having the devs teach me how to play.

4570
02:37:09,060 --> 02:37:10,340
Also fucking...

4571
02:37:10,340 --> 02:37:10,940
Okay...

4572
02:37:12,760 --> 02:37:14,520
The tank was so cool.

4573
02:37:14,860 --> 02:37:17,280
But the fact that like...

4574
02:37:17,280 --> 02:37:18,380
I got stopped.

4575
02:37:18,380 --> 02:37:20,300
Stopped by the fucking tunnel.

4576
02:37:20,420 --> 02:37:21,840
Because it's like...

4577
02:37:22,360 --> 02:37:27,020
This parking lot can only take cars that are 4 feet...

4578
02:37:27,020 --> 02:37:28,760
4.5 feet and under.

4579
02:37:29,080 --> 02:37:30,280
I was like...

4580
02:37:30,280 --> 02:37:31,120
No!

4581
02:37:31,480 --> 02:37:32,300
Where is...

4582
02:37:35,060 --> 02:37:36,020
The realism.

4583
02:37:39,100 --> 02:37:42,260
I can't believe it.

4584
02:37:42,380 --> 02:37:44,000
I was like...

4585
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:45,260
I was like...

4586
02:37:45,260 --> 02:37:46,660
I can't believe it.

4587
02:37:46,840 --> 02:37:48,380
The fucking tank.

4588
02:37:48,580 --> 02:37:49,740
Why tank?

4589
02:37:49,740 --> 02:37:51,580
If I can't go anywhere.

4590
02:37:52,060 --> 02:37:52,820
Exactly!

4591
02:37:53,680 --> 02:37:57,500
Why can't I use the tank if I can't go anywhere?

4592
02:37:58,060 --> 02:38:04,100
I was so surprised.

4593
02:38:04,280 --> 02:38:05,400
I was like...

4594
02:38:05,400 --> 02:38:08,260
Why can't my tank go anywhere?

4595
02:38:10,760 --> 02:38:12,520
It looked cool.

4596
02:38:12,720 --> 02:38:14,740
I'm just sad I couldn't do anything.

4597
02:38:15,340 --> 02:38:17,940
I can't even run over the trees.

4598
02:38:17,940 --> 02:38:21,280
I can't even burn the trees down.

4599
02:38:22,420 --> 02:38:24,100
What is the point?

4600
02:38:26,640 --> 02:38:29,980
I like the soundtrack though.

4601
02:38:30,340 --> 02:38:30,960
I like that.

4602
02:38:31,060 --> 02:38:31,960
I was just...

4603
02:38:31,960 --> 02:38:32,300
I was like...

4604
02:38:32,300 --> 02:38:32,420
Wow!

4605
02:38:32,540 --> 02:38:34,140
They got the final countdown right.

4606
02:38:34,240 --> 02:38:34,820
So I was like...

4607
02:38:34,820 --> 02:38:36,020
Very impressed.

4608
02:38:36,020 --> 02:38:37,620
They got right to the final countdown.

4609
02:38:37,960 --> 02:38:38,800
And now...

4610
02:38:38,800 --> 02:38:39,340
And now...

4611
02:38:39,340 --> 02:38:43,540
And now the creators of the final countdown are gonna get my ad revenue.

4612
02:38:43,720 --> 02:38:44,460
But that's okay.

4613
02:38:44,680 --> 02:38:45,080
That's...

4614
02:38:45,760 --> 02:38:47,720
They clearly need more money.

4615
02:38:50,780 --> 02:38:52,260
But I had a great time.

4616
02:38:52,420 --> 02:38:55,720
Huge shoutout to the developers for inviting me and for...

4617
02:38:57,680 --> 02:38:59,120
And for giving me a code.

4618
02:38:59,260 --> 02:39:00,540
I'm sorry I didn't do my homework.

4619
02:39:00,640 --> 02:39:01,840
My dog ate my homework.

4620
02:39:01,960 --> 02:39:02,540
I'm really sorry.

4621
02:39:02,920 --> 02:39:06,240
I did my homework like five minutes before class started.

4622
02:39:06,580 --> 02:39:07,960
But at least I showed up.

4623
02:39:08,040 --> 02:39:08,360
You know?

4624
02:39:10,680 --> 02:39:13,760
Unlike that other guy that never showed up.

4625
02:39:13,880 --> 02:39:16,080
Unlike that one guy that didn't show up.

4626
02:39:16,140 --> 02:39:16,800
I showed up.

4627
02:39:22,740 --> 02:39:23,100
Alright, I gotta go.

4628
02:39:23,100 --> 02:39:23,280
Um...

4629
02:39:24,920 --> 02:39:25,280
Yeah.

4630
02:39:25,700 --> 02:39:26,060
Anyways.

4631
02:39:26,240 --> 02:39:26,900
I win it.

4632
02:39:26,940 --> 02:39:28,180
Like, I wasn't gonna stream today.

4633
02:39:28,340 --> 02:39:29,000
But like I said.

4634
02:39:29,080 --> 02:39:30,500
I got an invite to this playtest.

4635
02:39:30,720 --> 02:39:31,820
So that's why I'm here.

4636
02:39:32,440 --> 02:39:35,060
And, uh, I hope you guys had a great time watching.

4637
02:39:35,580 --> 02:39:35,940
Um...

4638
02:39:35,940 --> 02:39:37,660
By the way, also a little update.

4639
02:39:38,240 --> 02:39:40,460
Also a little update, by the way.

4640
02:39:42,960 --> 02:39:48,780
We picked the winners for the Gamersub art contest.

4641
02:39:49,480 --> 02:39:50,200
Finally.

4642
02:39:50,500 --> 02:39:51,760
I'm so sorry.

4643
02:39:51,840 --> 02:39:53,980
I got really delayed because life.

4644
02:39:54,740 --> 02:39:57,100
But we finally picked the winners.

4645
02:39:57,180 --> 02:40:01,620
We have contacted the winners of the Gamersubs art contest.

4646
02:40:02,700 --> 02:40:06,920
We sent emails out, I believe, yesterday.

4647
02:40:07,660 --> 02:40:09,960
Those that got top...

4648
02:40:10,620 --> 02:40:12,220
Those that got...

4649
02:40:13,880 --> 02:40:15,120
Actually, okay.

4650
02:40:15,260 --> 02:40:16,640
I think...

4651
02:40:16,640 --> 02:40:17,960
Oh, okay.

4652
02:40:18,140 --> 02:40:20,600
Wait, I need to remember what my staff told me.

4653
02:40:20,880 --> 02:40:24,580
Okay, so, top 5 got emails currently.

4654
02:40:24,700 --> 02:40:29,200
Because we are going to be using the top 5 for merch.

4655
02:40:29,520 --> 02:40:31,600
So, top 5 got emails.

4656
02:40:32,380 --> 02:40:40,800
The other placements, top 6 and under, like 6 to 22, have not yet got emails yet.

4657
02:40:41,120 --> 02:40:44,920
So, if you're top 5, you got your emails.

4658
02:40:45,040 --> 02:40:48,460
Because we're planning on, you know, making merch out of it.

4659
02:40:48,740 --> 02:40:50,740
So, just that.

4660
02:40:50,900 --> 02:40:53,160
So, you guys didn't get email, but you're in the top 22.

4661
02:40:53,820 --> 02:40:55,760
I don't know if emails are being sent out later.

4662
02:40:56,160 --> 02:40:57,560
I'm not handling the email.

4663
02:40:57,620 --> 02:41:00,060
I chose... I just chose who won.

4664
02:41:00,240 --> 02:41:00,580
That's...

4665
02:41:01,620 --> 02:41:03,100
I chose the top 22.

4666
02:41:03,320 --> 02:41:03,860
That's it.

4667
02:41:04,040 --> 02:41:07,480
And then I let the staff and gamer subs handle the rest.

4668
02:41:11,040 --> 02:41:16,600
So, I most likely will be announcing the winners next week.

4669
02:41:19,320 --> 02:41:20,080
So, yeah.

4670
02:41:21,060 --> 02:41:22,320
Anyway, also Minecraft.

4671
02:41:22,480 --> 02:41:24,340
For those who are wondering about the Minecraft server.

4672
02:41:24,660 --> 02:41:26,300
So, apparently, I was...

4673
02:41:26,300 --> 02:41:28,040
I mean, the members, I was talking about...

4674
02:41:28,040 --> 02:41:29,200
Sorry about the whitelist.

4675
02:41:29,340 --> 02:41:31,440
The whitelist has been, like, stopped for a while.

4676
02:41:31,620 --> 02:41:35,080
Because we're trying to deal with making a special Discord server.

4677
02:41:35,340 --> 02:41:36,460
Just for the Minecraft.

4678
02:41:38,420 --> 02:41:40,620
And it's not gonna be...

4679
02:41:40,620 --> 02:41:42,020
I thought it was gonna be done today.

4680
02:41:42,080 --> 02:41:43,360
For the Discord server.

4681
02:41:43,600 --> 02:41:44,440
For the whitelist.

4682
02:41:44,900 --> 02:41:47,260
But they contacted me today.

4683
02:41:47,440 --> 02:41:49,380
And saying that the main developer.

4684
02:41:49,620 --> 02:41:51,660
The main person that's implementing it.

4685
02:41:51,740 --> 02:41:53,940
Has to go on a trip.

4686
02:41:54,020 --> 02:41:56,080
A business trip for the next two weeks.

4687
02:41:56,340 --> 02:41:58,040
So, he said that, like...

4688
02:41:58,040 --> 02:42:01,500
Well, the other developers will be working on implementing other updates.

4689
02:42:01,500 --> 02:42:02,180
To the server.

4690
02:42:02,240 --> 02:42:02,840
Minecraft server.

4691
02:42:03,640 --> 02:42:06,920
But the guy that's gonna implement it on Discord.

4692
02:42:07,160 --> 02:42:09,980
The main developer for the Discord.

4693
02:42:11,220 --> 02:42:13,020
He's gonna go on a business trip.

4694
02:42:13,420 --> 02:42:13,920
So...

4695
02:42:14,460 --> 02:42:15,940
And he's like, when he comes back.

4696
02:42:16,060 --> 02:42:18,480
It'll be implemented on the Discord server.

4697
02:42:18,840 --> 02:42:20,140
So, that is why.

4698
02:42:20,480 --> 02:42:21,340
It's not...

4699
02:42:21,340 --> 02:42:23,420
Yesterday, on the membership stream.

4700
02:42:23,580 --> 02:42:24,780
I said it might be done today.

4701
02:42:24,900 --> 02:42:26,340
But, like, apparently...

4702
02:42:29,180 --> 02:42:29,780
Apparently...

4703
02:42:29,780 --> 02:42:30,940
The other...

4704
02:42:30,940 --> 02:42:33,720
He has to go on a business trip.

4705
02:42:33,880 --> 02:42:34,200
So...

4706
02:42:34,200 --> 02:42:37,020
So, he won't be there until two weeks.

4707
02:42:37,120 --> 02:42:37,360
So...

4708
02:42:41,200 --> 02:42:42,140
So, that's why.

4709
02:42:42,460 --> 02:42:44,400
Sorry for those who are waiting for the whitelist.

4710
02:42:44,500 --> 02:42:47,420
Whitelist has literally been stopped for a while now.

4711
02:42:48,980 --> 02:42:52,980
Because we had to implement the new updates into the server.

4712
02:42:53,140 --> 02:42:54,640
So, we haven't been able to add anything.

4713
02:42:55,580 --> 02:42:58,560
And I was very busy with a lot of stuff.

4714
02:42:58,780 --> 02:42:59,080
So...

4715
02:43:00,400 --> 02:43:00,880
But...

4716
02:43:00,880 --> 02:43:03,640
Life is going on track at the moment.

4717
02:43:03,800 --> 02:43:05,100
I'm a lot less...

4718
02:43:05,100 --> 02:43:06,620
No, I'm still really busy.

4719
02:43:06,860 --> 02:43:10,840
But can finally handle, like, behind the scenes work now.

4720
02:43:11,200 --> 02:43:11,680
Like...

4721
02:43:11,680 --> 02:43:12,520
Properly.

4722
02:43:12,680 --> 02:43:13,360
So, yeah.

4723
02:43:13,500 --> 02:43:14,580
Life is on track.

4724
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:17,100
Like, it's still being fixed.

4725
02:43:17,180 --> 02:43:18,180
But life is on track.

4726
02:43:18,420 --> 02:43:18,780
Anyway.

4727
02:43:18,920 --> 02:43:19,880
I had a great time.

4728
02:43:20,140 --> 02:43:20,720
I really did.

4729
02:43:20,880 --> 02:43:22,480
I had a great time hanging out with everybody.

4730
02:43:23,440 --> 02:43:23,920
And...

4731
02:43:23,920 --> 02:43:24,920
Like I said.

4732
02:43:25,080 --> 02:43:25,780
Like, I went...

4733
02:43:25,780 --> 02:43:26,600
I didn't realize.

4734
02:43:26,800 --> 02:43:27,780
I legitimately...

4735
02:43:27,780 --> 02:43:28,580
I thought...

4736
02:43:28,580 --> 02:43:29,620
That, like...

4737
02:43:29,620 --> 02:43:34,540
I didn't realize it was, like, a playtest with a very small group of people.

4738
02:43:34,800 --> 02:43:35,860
Because when they said...

4739
02:43:35,860 --> 02:43:37,900
I thought it was gonna be, like...

4740
02:43:37,900 --> 02:43:39,300
Like, I wasn't...

4741
02:43:39,300 --> 02:43:40,900
I've been in Apex playtest.

4742
02:43:41,060 --> 02:43:42,920
And I've been, like, another, like, big...

4743
02:43:42,920 --> 02:43:44,460
Like, I guess, like, Apex playtest.

4744
02:43:44,820 --> 02:43:45,300
And...

4745
02:43:47,260 --> 02:43:48,220
Marvel Rivals.

4746
02:43:48,360 --> 02:43:52,420
So, I legitimately assumed, like, it was just people just queuing up.

4747
02:43:52,460 --> 02:43:53,260
Queuing up.

4748
02:43:53,320 --> 02:43:54,440
And then we're just playing.

4749
02:43:54,780 --> 02:43:57,520
I didn't realize that it was a very small...

4750
02:43:57,520 --> 02:43:58,500
Like, group of people.

4751
02:43:58,780 --> 02:44:01,000
So, I went in very chill.

4752
02:44:01,240 --> 02:44:02,420
Like, I went...

4753
02:44:02,420 --> 02:44:05,680
Like, I went in thinking that I was...

4754
02:44:05,680 --> 02:44:06,800
Like, I was just gonna...

4755
02:44:06,800 --> 02:44:10,040
I could, like, talk to you guys before going in and start...

4756
02:44:10,040 --> 02:44:11,740
Like, talk to you guys before play...

4757
02:44:11,740 --> 02:44:12,920
Like, just queuing up a game.

4758
02:44:13,040 --> 02:44:14,040
But I was, like, oh, man.

4759
02:44:14,120 --> 02:44:15,460
This is a very personal experience.

4760
02:44:15,900 --> 02:44:16,300
I was, like...

4761
02:44:16,300 --> 02:44:18,280
I didn't even realize, like, you know...

4762
02:44:18,280 --> 02:44:20,320
Devs were gonna be talking to me.

4763
02:44:20,920 --> 02:44:21,320
Like...

4764
02:44:26,320 --> 02:44:26,720
Um...

4765
02:44:26,720 --> 02:44:27,300
So, yeah.

4766
02:44:27,300 --> 02:44:27,340
So, yeah.

4767
02:44:28,160 --> 02:44:29,380
So, that's why I went...

4768
02:44:29,380 --> 02:44:30,780
When the beginning of the stream, I was like...

4769
02:44:30,780 --> 02:44:32,040
I don't even know...

4770
02:44:32,040 --> 02:44:35,600
I don't even know if I was suppo- I was like, oh, no.

4771
02:44:35,700 --> 02:44:38,500
Am I allowed to stream this, like, discord call?

4772
02:44:39,400 --> 02:44:45,660
It was like, at the playtesters, we need you in the lobby in the voice chat while we prepare.

4773
02:44:45,920 --> 02:44:46,920
And I was like, what?

4774
02:44:51,560 --> 02:44:55,160
I was like, what do you mean you need me in the discord call?

4775
02:44:55,300 --> 02:44:58,120
So, I was just gonna talk to my chat at 6 p.m.

4776
02:44:58,180 --> 02:44:59,380
I was like, oh, man.

4777
02:45:00,060 --> 02:45:00,460
I was like, what?

4778
02:45:01,140 --> 02:45:09,760
And then they had my stream open and it was like, Doki is asking right now if we could stream this discord conversation, and I was like, NO!

4779
02:45:10,200 --> 02:45:10,720
WHAT?!

4780
02:45:13,600 --> 02:45:16,480
What do you mean you're watching this?!

4781
02:45:16,480 --> 02:45:21,060
This is my private sanctuary in front of 2,000 people!

4782
02:45:24,080 --> 02:45:25,700
How did you know?

4783
02:45:26,160 --> 02:45:31,220
This is my 2,000 plus echo chamber.

4784
02:45:36,200 --> 02:45:37,680
Very private.

4785
02:45:43,040 --> 02:45:45,240
I thought it was really funny.

4786
02:45:45,240 --> 02:45:50,920
I thought that was really funny.

4787
02:45:51,140 --> 02:45:53,720
I got called out so many times.

4788
02:45:54,840 --> 02:45:57,480
They're like, Doki, did you do the tutorial?

4789
02:45:57,600 --> 02:45:59,160
And I'm like, YEAH!

4790
02:45:59,500 --> 02:46:01,340
As I am in the custom character.

4791
02:46:03,020 --> 02:46:05,860
I was customizing my character.

4792
02:46:09,900 --> 02:46:12,240
Anyway, that was fun.

4793
02:46:15,240 --> 02:46:16,700
It was really fun.

4794
02:46:17,780 --> 02:46:19,780
And guys, I'm going to call it here.

4795
02:46:19,840 --> 02:46:21,920
Tomorrow is another sponsored stream.

4796
02:46:22,240 --> 02:46:24,000
This one was just an invited playtest.

4797
02:46:24,060 --> 02:46:24,860
I wasn't sponsored.

4798
02:46:25,820 --> 02:46:32,620
I wasn't sponsored to do today's stream, but I wanted to do the playtest and check it out.

4799
02:46:32,660 --> 02:46:35,400
I heard stuff about Sen and so I thought it was fun to check it out.

4800
02:46:35,900 --> 02:46:38,020
Tomorrow is an actual sponsored stream.

4801
02:46:39,940 --> 02:46:44,100
Bandai sponsored me to check out one of their newest games, Senuality.

4802
02:46:45,240 --> 02:46:47,620
I'm pronouncing it wrong because I'm illiterate.

4803
02:46:49,720 --> 02:46:52,580
But yeah, go support that stream tomorrow.

4804
02:46:53,320 --> 02:46:55,260
Creator Corner, thank you so much for the super chat.

4805
02:46:55,380 --> 02:46:56,200
Thank you, thank you.

4806
02:46:56,300 --> 02:46:58,320
Can't describe this so much without putting in words.

4807
02:46:58,420 --> 02:47:01,580
I guess thank you so much for your love and your support of your community.

4808
02:47:01,680 --> 02:47:03,660
Thank you, thank you for the super chat, Creator Corner.

4809
02:47:03,740 --> 02:47:04,720
Thank you, thank you.

4810
02:47:04,960 --> 02:47:06,160
I really appreciate it.

4811
02:47:06,200 --> 02:47:06,840
Thank you so much.

4812
02:47:07,080 --> 02:47:09,480
Anyway, I'm going to see you guys tomorrow, everybody.

4813
02:47:09,800 --> 02:47:10,760
Thanks for hanging out.

4814
02:47:12,260 --> 02:47:13,560
The rest of the week has been great.

4815
02:47:13,780 --> 02:47:14,600
I haven't been working.

4816
02:47:14,600 --> 02:47:16,240
The first three days.

4817
02:47:16,840 --> 02:47:24,780
By the way, I did show up in a couple of collabs with Ellum because he invited me to some collabs while I was resting.

4818
02:47:25,060 --> 02:47:28,180
I didn't really announce it, but you can check out Ellum.

4819
02:47:28,280 --> 02:47:31,220
I know Nycewig was in one of the collabs and stuff.

4820
02:47:31,900 --> 02:47:33,180
Ellum and Nycewig's mods.

4821
02:47:34,120 --> 02:47:39,780
Because I didn't announce it on Twitter or social media because I was also resting.

4822
02:47:40,140 --> 02:47:41,720
And then it's one of those games where...

4823
02:47:43,020 --> 02:47:44,440
It's basically like...

4824
02:47:44,600 --> 02:47:45,380
Where's Doki?

4825
02:47:45,580 --> 02:47:45,960
Like...

4826
02:47:46,540 --> 02:47:47,500
Where's Waldo?

4827
02:47:48,540 --> 02:47:49,560
And Psychonauts.

4828
02:47:49,600 --> 02:47:53,400
So I didn't announce it because I was super down low key.

4829
02:47:54,020 --> 02:47:57,800
Not like low energy, but not streaming.

4830
02:47:58,100 --> 02:48:00,700
So then I was just like, I'll just fucking exist.

4831
02:48:01,700 --> 02:48:04,020
Interact when I need to interact type deal.

4832
02:48:05,680 --> 02:48:12,100
And I know people would be trying to find like, oh, where's DokiBrain in the POVs?

4833
02:48:12,100 --> 02:48:13,220
Because I was jumping around.

4834
02:48:13,220 --> 02:48:15,400
Like just hanging out and stuff.

4835
02:48:15,640 --> 02:48:16,260
So yeah.

4836
02:48:17,300 --> 02:48:19,560
That's why I tend to not announce these types of collabs.

4837
02:48:19,600 --> 02:48:21,160
Especially if I don't have my own POV.

4838
02:48:21,460 --> 02:48:23,240
And there's a lot of people in it.

4839
02:48:23,940 --> 02:48:26,720
If there's a lot of people in it, I tend to not announce it.

4840
02:48:27,420 --> 02:48:28,620
Especially if I have no POV.

4841
02:48:28,880 --> 02:48:29,360
So yeah.

4842
02:48:31,380 --> 02:48:31,940
There's that.

4843
02:48:32,080 --> 02:48:39,380
If you guys want to check out some VODs to catch up on if you want to.

4844
02:48:39,860 --> 02:48:40,300
Anyway.

4845
02:48:40,860 --> 02:48:41,300
Anyway.

4846
02:48:42,400 --> 02:48:43,200
I am...

4847
02:48:43,200 --> 02:48:44,780
I'm going to head out for real now, chat.

4848
02:48:45,260 --> 02:48:47,040
It's been a very nice rest week.

4849
02:48:47,100 --> 02:48:47,640
Not going to lie.

4850
02:48:47,820 --> 02:48:48,820
I really needed it.

4851
02:48:48,900 --> 02:48:52,340
I definitely really, really needed the rest week.

4852
02:48:52,440 --> 02:48:53,560
It was really nice.

4853
02:48:53,660 --> 02:48:57,660
Just not doing anything and just sleeping in.

4854
02:48:57,840 --> 02:48:59,420
Yesterday I started working again.

4855
02:48:59,660 --> 02:49:02,000
So back on work mode.

4856
02:49:02,380 --> 02:49:04,480
But other than that, it's been a nice break.

4857
02:49:04,600 --> 02:49:08,960
I almost got really burnt out after Street Fighter.

4858
02:49:09,240 --> 02:49:12,960
I play so much Street Fighter.

4859
02:49:12,960 --> 02:49:16,080
That I was so burnt out.

4860
02:49:16,580 --> 02:49:20,320
Because I did not take a lot of breaks.

4861
02:49:20,540 --> 02:49:21,240
Other than...

4862
02:49:21,240 --> 02:49:23,260
I'm glad I did take the break the day before the finals.

4863
02:49:23,480 --> 02:49:25,780
But at that point, I was like, I needed to rest.

4864
02:49:27,940 --> 02:49:31,140
I was like, I needed to rest.

4865
02:49:31,540 --> 02:49:34,760
So it's been really nice.

4866
02:49:35,040 --> 02:49:40,460
It's been really, really nice just being able to relax.

4867
02:49:40,660 --> 02:49:41,240
I feel...

4868
02:49:41,240 --> 02:49:41,940
I know...

4869
02:49:41,940 --> 02:49:43,120
Especially like...

4870
02:49:43,120 --> 02:49:44,130
I know like the team...

4871
02:49:44,560 --> 02:49:45,680
Because the teams...

4872
02:49:45,680 --> 02:49:46,500
You guys don't know.

4873
02:49:47,140 --> 02:49:52,020
Sykuno will be representing me for Team Brian F.

4874
02:49:52,520 --> 02:49:57,700
So Sykuno will be substituting for me for the tournament.

4875
02:49:58,100 --> 02:50:03,160
So everybody is grinding every day on Street Fighter.

4876
02:50:03,400 --> 02:50:05,040
For those who are...

4877
02:50:05,040 --> 02:50:07,660
He's going to be wearing a Doki Bird wig.

4878
02:50:07,820 --> 02:50:08,800
That was my only condition.

4879
02:50:09,180 --> 02:50:09,940
I was like...

4880
02:50:10,660 --> 02:50:11,300
Um...

4881
02:50:11,300 --> 02:50:12,460
That's why I tweeted out.

4882
02:50:12,640 --> 02:50:13,580
I was like, I need a wig.

4883
02:50:13,720 --> 02:50:14,780
I was like...

4884
02:50:15,800 --> 02:50:17,140
They were like asking my...

4885
02:50:17,140 --> 02:50:18,940
Is it okay if Sykuno subs in?

4886
02:50:19,180 --> 02:50:19,700
And I was like...

4887
02:50:19,700 --> 02:50:20,800
If he wears the wig.

4888
02:50:22,140 --> 02:50:23,080
That's literally it!

4889
02:50:23,380 --> 02:50:24,520
I was like...

4890
02:50:25,060 --> 02:50:27,140
Only if he wears the wig.

4891
02:50:28,080 --> 02:50:28,920
And they're like...

4892
02:50:28,920 --> 02:50:29,480
Okay...

4893
02:50:29,480 --> 02:50:30,740
Like we can make that happen.

4894
02:50:31,400 --> 02:50:32,200
Because I was like...

4895
02:50:32,200 --> 02:50:32,960
I'll pay for it.

4896
02:50:33,200 --> 02:50:35,220
I was like...

4897
02:50:35,220 --> 02:50:36,120
I'll pay for the wig.

4898
02:50:36,180 --> 02:50:37,320
I just need him to wear it.

4899
02:50:37,360 --> 02:50:37,640
Like...

4900
02:50:39,620 --> 02:50:41,280
I was like...

4901
02:50:44,540 --> 02:50:46,940
So he's going to wear the wings.

4902
02:50:48,240 --> 02:50:50,000
I've commissioned somebody.

4903
02:50:50,060 --> 02:50:51,260
It's going to be done by TwitchCon.

4904
02:50:51,600 --> 02:50:55,980
But yeah, I was like, everybody is grinding Street Fighter right now.

4905
02:50:56,040 --> 02:51:01,440
I know Lily got to plat rank, as in the beginner division too.

4906
02:51:01,540 --> 02:51:06,160
She's in plat rank and everybody is literally playing every day on Street Fighter.

4907
02:51:06,320 --> 02:51:08,840
I was like, Godspeed to all of you guys.

4908
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:13,920
To everybody grinding every day for it.

4909
02:51:14,540 --> 02:51:17,580
Because I was like, oh my God, I don't know if I could...

4910
02:51:17,580 --> 02:51:18,460
I don't know.

4911
02:51:19,060 --> 02:51:20,940
Because I'm a variety streamer.

4912
02:51:21,080 --> 02:51:23,800
I'm a variety streamer, so I was like, I don't know.

4913
02:51:24,260 --> 02:51:29,720
If I was at TwitchCon, I had to play Street Fighter for another two weeks until TwitchCon.

4914
02:51:30,020 --> 02:51:31,960
And then hard grind the game.

4915
02:51:32,080 --> 02:51:33,340
And I was like, oh my God, I don't know.

4916
02:51:42,360 --> 02:51:45,840
So I wish them good luck in all the division.

4917
02:51:46,220 --> 02:51:47,740
Yeah, I wish them good luck.

4918
02:51:47,820 --> 02:51:50,840
I know like Bra Pro went on vacation right after.

4919
02:51:51,480 --> 02:51:57,420
Because like he got like burnt out from the rank grind like the day before the finals too.

4920
02:51:57,680 --> 02:52:01,520
So I was like, you got to be able to balance it too.

4921
02:52:01,720 --> 02:52:03,200
So I hope everybody will be okay.

4922
02:52:03,260 --> 02:52:07,860
I know SK has been fucking streaming Street Fighter for like eight plus hours every day.

4923
02:52:07,860 --> 02:52:10,380
Like I was like, oh my God.

4924
02:52:10,440 --> 02:52:12,140
Like, are you okay?

4925
02:52:14,980 --> 02:52:18,180
Because she's like, til queuing rank two.

4926
02:52:18,400 --> 02:52:19,340
And I'm like, are you?

4927
02:52:19,380 --> 02:52:20,280
Oh my God, SK.

4928
02:52:21,820 --> 02:52:27,800
Like she's been doing eight plus hours til queuing Street Fighter rank every day.

4929
02:52:30,100 --> 02:52:32,420
And I'm just like, are you okay?

4930
02:52:41,600 --> 02:52:50,360
I told you guys, I was like, I told you guys, I stopped rank at silver four because it's never been that angry before.

4931
02:52:51,860 --> 02:52:59,440
This has been like, I had like, I've never had experience in rank where I've been that angry that I literally stopped playing rank.

4932
02:52:59,620 --> 02:53:01,080
Because I'm very competitive.

4933
02:53:01,180 --> 02:53:03,080
I'm a very competitive person in general.

4934
02:53:03,260 --> 02:53:06,300
So like I could queue rank for like a long time.

4935
02:53:06,440 --> 02:53:07,020
But like...

4936
02:53:07,020 --> 02:53:10,340
I hit a breaking point with Street Fighter rank.

4937
02:53:10,500 --> 02:53:11,280
I actually did.

4938
02:53:11,480 --> 02:53:13,040
Like I actually...

4939
02:53:16,140 --> 02:53:17,840
That I stopped.

4940
02:53:24,740 --> 02:53:27,260
Like I was just like, I'm just doing custom rooms.

4941
02:53:27,440 --> 02:53:30,340
Like I'm doing custom rooms.

4942
02:53:33,600 --> 02:53:35,980
I've never like been so mad.

4943
02:53:37,840 --> 02:53:39,560
I've never been so mad.

4944
02:53:43,280 --> 02:53:45,240
I was like, no I can't.

4945
02:53:45,280 --> 02:53:46,840
I can't keep doing rank anymore.

4946
02:53:46,920 --> 02:53:48,380
I'm just gonna practice custom.

4947
02:53:48,480 --> 02:53:49,980
Practice against viewers.

4948
02:53:52,660 --> 02:53:54,940
But it was still a really fun experience.

4949
02:53:55,880 --> 02:53:58,340
Especially like interacting with...

4950
02:53:58,340 --> 02:53:59,860
It was really fun though.

4951
02:53:59,900 --> 02:54:00,840
I made a lot of new friends.

4952
02:54:01,340 --> 02:54:02,620
In Sajam Slam.

4953
02:54:03,200 --> 02:54:04,240
In Street Fighter.

4954
02:54:04,400 --> 02:54:05,360
I made a lot of new friends.

4955
02:54:05,360 --> 02:54:08,700
And got to interact with a lot of new people.

4956
02:54:08,920 --> 02:54:11,820
And a lot of people seemed to really like watching me too.

4957
02:54:12,020 --> 02:54:13,700
From the FGC community.

4958
02:54:14,120 --> 02:54:16,840
So I still don't know what Doki Zeme means.

4959
02:54:17,080 --> 02:54:19,660
Everybody keeps saying like, oh my god Doki Zeme.

4960
02:54:19,880 --> 02:54:21,360
I don't know what that means.

4961
02:54:21,580 --> 02:54:23,040
And I still don't know what neutral means.

4962
02:54:23,200 --> 02:54:24,500
But I'm pretending that I do.

4963
02:54:25,600 --> 02:54:26,500
I'm not.

4964
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:28,520
I'm not.

4965
02:54:29,800 --> 02:54:30,580
I'm not.

4966
02:54:31,500 --> 02:54:32,020
I'm not.

4967
02:54:32,560 --> 02:54:32,620
I'm not.

4968
02:54:33,380 --> 02:54:34,280
I'm not.

4969
02:54:34,460 --> 02:54:35,160
I'm not.

4970
02:54:35,300 --> 02:54:38,340
I'm gonna let everybody think I actually understand what neutral is.

4971
02:54:40,020 --> 02:54:42,560
I still don't know what it actually means.

4972
02:54:43,100 --> 02:54:46,180
But I'm glad people enjoyed my...

4973
02:54:48,500 --> 02:54:49,400
I was...

4974
02:54:49,400 --> 02:54:50,680
I said it in my member stream.

4975
02:54:50,840 --> 02:54:53,380
But I was basically everybody's character arc.

4976
02:54:53,560 --> 02:54:54,540
Which was funny.

4977
02:54:54,680 --> 02:54:55,700
I thought that was really funny.

4978
02:54:57,680 --> 02:55:01,640
That I suddenly became everybody's character arc.

4979
02:55:01,800 --> 02:55:02,940
Like I was like...

4980
02:55:02,940 --> 02:55:03,620
Like...

4981
02:55:03,620 --> 02:55:06,700
Like I helped grow everybody in general.

4982
02:55:07,340 --> 02:55:11,120
Like everybody had like a storyline with me.

4983
02:55:16,260 --> 02:55:19,140
The amount of like clips that showed up.

4984
02:55:19,220 --> 02:55:22,680
Like every action of finally beating Doki Bird.

4985
02:55:22,840 --> 02:55:26,640
Like from different people that I fought.

4986
02:55:26,780 --> 02:55:28,300
Like I thought that was really funny.

4987
02:55:35,100 --> 02:55:35,620
Um...

4988
02:55:35,620 --> 02:55:36,480
Um...

4989
02:55:36,480 --> 02:55:37,400
So...

4990
02:55:37,400 --> 02:55:37,840
Yeah.

4991
02:55:37,960 --> 02:55:38,500
I was...

4992
02:55:38,500 --> 02:55:40,100
I was everybody's character arc.

4993
02:55:40,380 --> 02:55:40,900
Everybody...

4994
02:55:40,900 --> 02:55:42,740
Like every tournament needed a heal.

4995
02:55:42,920 --> 02:55:44,880
And I'm glad to be that heal.

4996
02:55:45,120 --> 02:55:48,920
And I'm glad everybody enjoyed my dumb ass...

4997
02:55:48,920 --> 02:55:49,600
Me.

4998
02:55:49,800 --> 02:55:50,320
Like...

4999
02:55:50,320 --> 02:55:52,060
Enjoyed this dumb ass.

5000
02:55:52,260 --> 02:55:52,780
Like...

5001
02:55:52,780 --> 02:55:54,760
I don't know what I was doing.

5002
02:55:54,860 --> 02:55:56,920
But I'm glad people had a great time watching.

5003
02:55:57,340 --> 02:55:57,860
Uh...

5004
02:55:57,860 --> 02:55:58,200
So yeah.

5005
02:55:58,260 --> 02:55:59,560
Thank you to all the new viewers.

5006
02:55:59,600 --> 02:56:00,900
That followed me.

5007
02:56:00,980 --> 02:56:01,980
And subscribed to me.

5008
02:56:01,980 --> 02:56:03,080
After Sajam Slam.

5009
02:56:03,480 --> 02:56:04,000
Um...

5010
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:04,300
Yeah!

5011
02:56:04,480 --> 02:56:06,820
And then I got acknowledged by Angry Bird.

5012
02:56:06,940 --> 02:56:07,820
If you guys didn't...

5013
02:56:07,820 --> 02:56:07,960
Wait.

5014
02:56:08,040 --> 02:56:09,320
Is it Angry Bird or Big Bird?

5015
02:56:09,440 --> 02:56:09,820
I got...

5016
02:56:09,820 --> 02:56:11,180
I lost track of all the birds.

5017
02:56:11,440 --> 02:56:12,480
I lost...

5018
02:56:12,480 --> 02:56:14,780
I lost track of the birds.

5019
02:56:14,940 --> 02:56:15,360
Sorry.

5020
02:56:15,440 --> 02:56:17,020
I got acknowledged by Big Bird.

5021
02:56:17,140 --> 02:56:19,000

5022
02:56:19,840 --> 02:56:20,360
Um...

5023

5024
02:56:21,300 --> 02:56:22,180
Bird.

5025
02:56:22,600 --> 02:56:25,220
I got acknowledged by Big Bird.

5026
02:56:25,840 --> 02:56:26,360
Um...

5027
02:56:26,360 --> 02:56:27,500
There's too many birds.

5028
02:56:27,700 --> 02:56:29,400
It's me, Angry Bird, and Big Bird.

5029
02:56:29,540 --> 02:56:31,340
And he like acknowledged me.

5030
02:56:31,480 --> 02:56:31,960
And was like...

5031
02:56:31,980 --> 02:56:34,440

5032
02:56:34,700 --> 02:56:35,240

That's me!

5034

I'm part of the bird family.

5035
02:56:38,680 --> 02:56:38,980
Uh...

5038
02:56:46,540 --> 02:56:47,020
Um...

5039
02:56:47,020 --> 02:56:48,460
So I thought that was really cool.

5040
02:56:48,820 --> 02:56:49,060
I...

5041
02:56:49,060 --> 02:56:50,380
I thought...

5042
02:56:50,380 --> 02:56:50,880
Yeah!

5043
02:56:50,980 --> 02:56:52,240
A lot of the FGC...

5044
02:56:52,240 --> 02:56:53,040
Uh...

5045
02:56:53,540 --> 02:56:54,020
Pros...

5046
02:56:54,020 --> 02:56:54,940
Acknowledged me.

5047
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:56,140
And I thought that was really cool.

5048
02:56:56,420 --> 02:56:58,180
Like a lot of people were freaking out...

5049
02:56:58,180 --> 02:56:59,140
About it.

5050
02:56:59,400 --> 02:56:59,880
Uh...

5051
02:56:59,880 --> 02:57:00,400
And like...

5052
02:57:00,400 --> 02:57:01,300
Even Justin was like...

5053
02:57:01,300 --> 02:57:01,800
It was so fun.

5054
02:57:01,840 --> 02:57:01,960
Like...

5055
02:57:01,960 --> 02:57:02,780
I'm like watching you play.

5056
02:57:03,100 --> 02:57:03,540
And...

5057
02:57:03,540 --> 02:57:04,580
He was really sad.

5058
02:57:04,720 --> 02:57:05,880
That I wasn't gonna be at TwitchCon.

5059
02:57:06,340 --> 02:57:06,780
Uh...

5060

5069
02:57:13,420 --> 02:57:14,820
We're gonna miss out on a Doki Zeme.

5073
02:57:17,860 --> 02:57:18,280

5075

You're so fun to play with.

And you're so fun to watch.

5077

5078
02:57:24,500 --> 02:57:25,020
Thank you.

02:57:25,120 --> 02:57:26,480
I really appreciate it, Justin.

5080
02:57:26,980 --> 02:57:28,460
I really appreciate it.

5081
02:57:29,080 --> 02:57:29,520

Street Fighter.

5106
02:57:48,380 --> 02:57:49,280
Seijam Slam.

5107
02:57:49,640 --> 02:57:50,240

Anyway.

5118
02:58:06,520 --> 02:58:07,180
I'm gonna...

5119
02:58:07,180 --> 02:58:08,720
Say bye for real now.

5120
02:58:09,220 --> 02:58:09,620
Cause...

5121
02:58:09,620 --> 02:58:10,280
Uh...

5122
02:58:10,880 --> 02:58:12,200
I need a rest, I guess.

5123
02:58:12,420 --> 02:58:12,720
Haha!

5124
02:58:13,600 --> 02:58:14,640
I need to eat dinner.

5125
02:58:14,860 --> 02:58:15,780
As always, everybody.

5126
02:58:15,980 --> 02:58:16,680
Stay hydrated.

5127
02:58:16,960 --> 02:58:17,440
Posture check.

5128
02:58:17,500 --> 02:58:18,180
Get up and move around.

5129
02:58:18,280 --> 02:58:19,060
To get that blood flowing.

5130
02:58:19,220 --> 02:58:20,540
And if you stayed up for me...

5131
02:58:20,540 --> 02:58:21,220
Head to bed!

5132
02:58:21,480 --> 02:58:21,880
Cause...

5133
02:58:21,880 --> 02:58:22,780
You deserve it.

5134
02:58:22,860 --> 02:58:24,260
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

5135
02:58:24,860 --> 02:58:25,720
Bye, guys!

5136
02:58:27,120 --> 02:58:27,520

5137
02:58:27,640 --> 02:58:28,040
