00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,310
Hello, sorry for being a little bit late today, everyone.

2
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,450
Oh my gosh, I swear to God.

3
00:01:50,830 --> 00:02:00,330
I've been getting, like, messages, like, five to ten minutes right before my stream time, and, like, there are, like, messages where you're like, you have to answer them now, or it'll be too late.

4
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:10,850
I had, like, I had, like, two messages, two DMs from two different things, and then also an email that's a reply to, and I was like, I'm just about to start streaming!

5
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,370
I was awake since ten in the morning!

6
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:15,850
What do you mean?

7
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,170
What do you mean you can't send this to me earlier?

8
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,470
Oh, it wasn't even ten.

9
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,570
I was awake since nine in the morning.

10
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,970
By the way, Dad is, um, Dad is not here right now.

11
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:30,190
Um, I put him at the babysitter, or the dog sitter, because, like, I need some me time.

12
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,970
Like, I'm sorry.

13
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,670
I... Mommy needs some me time!

14
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,050
I can't.

15
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,610
I really... I want to...

16
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,070
I want to sleep in.

17
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,870
Sage, thank you for the Super Chat.

18
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,050
Thank you, thank you!

19
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,090
Good job.

20
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:54,650
Ganu, super chat, thank you, glad to see the zero depth run is going well.

21
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,770
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you!

22
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,870
Yes, I'm still zero depth, guys.

23
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,510
So, happy Canada Day by the way.

24
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,090
It's debating on whether or not to do anything on Canada Day.

25
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:09,390
Like, you know, do stuff for myself.

26
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,610
Not for you guys.

27
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,030
Look, you guys have like two events already.

28
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:16,390
Do you really need a third?

29
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,810
Daddy needs some me time as well.

30
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:28,750
Like... We're so... I still have the birthday stream, Alan!

31
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,370
It's not just the concert.

32
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,390
We still have the birthday stream.

33
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,810
We're starving, Doki.

34
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:42,810
Anyway, so... Anyway, guys...

35
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,190
What do you mean you're starving?

36
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:48,190
I'm literally streaming on Canada Day.

37
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:53,270
Anyway, so I was debating whether... I'm doing two streams on Canada Day!

38
00:03:54,010 --> 00:04:03,130
I'm debating whether or not to like actually go out during Canada Day to like, you know, enjoy Canada Day.

39
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:07,870
But you see, as you see on my schedule, I am currently doing two streams today.

40
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:17,690
Um... But also, the reason why was that... Um... Um... Was that because... Uh... Um...

41
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:23,750
Like... I know like, during these events, it's gonna be like, super fucking crowded.

42
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,030
And also like, I don't know.

43
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,090
Like, I don't know.

44
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:31,150
I've... And like, expensive food that isn't worth it.

45
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,690
Like, overpriced food trucks.

46
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:33,790
And... And...

47
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:37,710
So... I don't know.

48
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:40,490
I just... I feel like it's gonna be like, incredibly crowded anyway.

49
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:46,130
And like, um... Like, there's not gonna be like... I guess there'd be like, you know, bands playing and stuff like that.

50
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:48,350
But I feel like it's just gonna be like, so fucking crowded.

51
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:51,110
And like, it's just like, filled with people.

52
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,170
And like, food is gonna be overpriced and shitty.

53
00:04:54,170 --> 00:05:01,510
And and so I was just like, ah, might as well just stay... Stay inside today.

54
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,370
I also went, I went to like a market.

55
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,970
Like, I went to like, a food market a couple of days ago.

56
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,990
I think like, on like, two to three days ago.

57
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,230
I went to like, a food market anyway.

58
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:18,790
And already it was... it was already, like, overpriced food and, like, uh, and overpriced shit.

59
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:23,890
I already had my experience that day of, like, what to expect for Canada Day.

60
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:31,070
So I figured, like, oh, man, like, you know, I don't have a fa... I don't, like, have, like, a family, uh, to do that with.

61
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:38,330
Or, like, anyone to really do, like, go out and, like, spend, like, spend too much money on things that, like, I might not need.

62
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:47,010
So I was just, like, uh, nah, I decided to stay in and stream today.

63
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:50,250
Uh, Zyko, thank you for the super chat.

64
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:50,570
Thank you.

65
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:51,330
Thank you.

66
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:54,330
Uh, uh, Jakarta, thank you for the super chat.

67
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:54,670
Thank you.

68
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,250
Thank you.

69
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,370
Wait, Doki is Canadian?

70
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,370
But their birthday is literally 4th of July.

71
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,330
I'm getting mixed messages here.

72
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,690
Since when was Doki Canadian?

73
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,450
Thank you for the super chat.

74
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:04,890
Thank you.

75
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:05,490
Thank you.

76
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,030
Okay, I wrote, like, a couple of things I really want to talk about.

77
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:13,850
Oh, yeah, by the way, for those who saw my schedule at first, and it says Mecha Break at 5 p.m.

78
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:19,170
PST, it's actually gonna be at, um, tonight at 9 p.m.

79
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,950
PST, because that's when the servers go live.

80
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,210
Um, we both fucked up.

81
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:30,370
Me and the agent fucked up because, like, or the agent for the sponsor fucked up because we were like, okay, 5 p.m.

82
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:36,990
PST is the normal, usual time that she does her, uh, streams, like, the more primetime streams.

83
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,130
And they're like, okay, yeah.

84
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:45,370
And then later on, I read the briefing, and it was like, servers are gonna start at 9, like, servers are gonna be on at 9 p.m.

85
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:45,770
PST.

86
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,150
And I was like, wait a minute.

87
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:53,390
Because my manager was like, make sure to read the briefing, make sure to read it.

88
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:58,370
You know, like, he's been, like, pushing me to be more prepared for sponsors.

89
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,370
So I was just like, okay.

90
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:04,730
And then, you know, for once in my life, I read the briefing a day before the sponsor.

91
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:07,150
And then it literally said 9 p.m.

92
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,190
And I was like, wait a minute.

93
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:12,750
How come, how come this says, like, 9 p.m.?

94
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,510
But, like, I'm gonna stream tomorrow at 5 p.m.?

95
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:18,130
And then we're like, wait, that's, that doesn't seem right.

96
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:21,230
So then we're like, oh, and then the AJ was like, oh, sorry.

97
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:22,990
Sorry, we've, we missed that.

98
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:23,530
We missed it.

99
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:29,630
We, we, sorry, that was like, uh, um, misunderstanding slash, like, what is it called?

100
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:35,550
Uh, they misread something and, like, uh, and was like, oh, shit, sorry.

101
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,490
Yeah, server's gonna be up at 9 p.m.

102
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,470
So, yeah, you might have to move your stream to that time.

103
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,030
And I was like, oh, okay, well.

104
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,030
All right, 9 p.m.

105
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,150
PST, yeah, oversight.

106
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,150
That was an oversight from them.

107
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,310
So they're like, all right.

108
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:52,510
So that's why I was like, okay, guys, 9 p.m.

109
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:53,450
PST on Twitch.

110
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:57,010
We're gonna, uh, we're gonna play Mecha Break, which is great.

111
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,130
Because, like, I was gonna play it for free anyway.

112
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:03,590
So the fact that they came up to me and be like, hey, we'll pay you to play the game.

113
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,770
And I was like, oh, that's cool.

114
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:05,510
I mean,

115
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:14,670
The only downside is that I gotta be a little bit more family-friendly.

116
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:19,070
But, you know, but at least I don't get to play it for free.

117
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:19,930
Like, I...

118
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,250
So I was like, oh, shit, nice.

119
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:25,510
I was gonna play it anyway.

120
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,770
But, yeah, I get paid to play it.

121
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:30,170
Just gotta be a little more family-friendly than usual.

122
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:53,630
But, yeah, no, it's gonna be pretty exciting.

123
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:57,250
I heard a lot of good things above Mecha Break.

124
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,730
Uh, so I'm looking forward to trying out the game later tonight.

125
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:12,250
Um, also, um, I found out that, uh, because I didn't realize this, because I've been so busy, I actually haven't been, like, keeping up to date with Marvel Rivals.

126
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:20,170
But we're gonna have an extra stream this week for the early access, uh, for Marvel Rivals Season 3.

127
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,910
Uh, and that is, I believe, also on July 3rd.

128
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,090
Uh, so it'll be at, like, 4 p.m.

129
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:26,510
PST.

130
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,510
So it is an extra bonus stream.

131
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,630
Um, because I forgot about that.

132
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:36,350
I didn't even realize it was gonna be that soon, the early access, because the new season starts at July 12th?

133
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:42,310
I believe the newest season for Season 3 for Marvel Rivals starts at July 13th.

134
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:48,670
But, like, the early season preview starts at July 3rd.

135
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,050
So I didn't realize that.

136
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:55,730
So the only reason why I found out was because, uh, one of my friends was asking me, like, Oh, did you know the new hero?

137
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:56,950
What the new hero's gonna be?

138
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,670
I was like, no.

139
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,050
And he's like, oh, it's gonna be Phoenix.

140
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,610
And that was before, like, today got announced it was gonna be Phoenix.

141
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,290
So, like, they, like, leaked it to me.

142
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,470
And I was like, oh, I won't say who, because maybe.

143
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,170
But it's out anyway.

144
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,370
So I was like, oh, shit.

145
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:17,050
So then, like, yesterday, like, I was, it was leaked to me, like, a day early before, uh, the Marvel Rivals thing will be on YouTube.

146
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:21,670
Um, but basically, they leaked it to me, like, a day before it got announced, which is today.

147
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,330
So I got, I knew about it yesterday.

148
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,010
Or the, no, I knew about it two days before they announced it.

149
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:31,250
So, um, um, so I was like, oh, shit, okay.

150
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,670
Uh, no, I didn't hear about it.

151
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,650
And then they're like, oh, yeah, they're gonna be doing the season preview soon.

152
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,710
And I was like, oh, shit.

153
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:39,150
So then I messaged my Marvel Rivals person.

154
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:44,810
I was like, hey, can I be, like, in the other, the newest preview, the next streamer preview event?

155
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,770
Because, I know, I was like, oh, I'm gonna do it anyway, but it'll be cool if I get paid for it.

156
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,430
I didn't say that.

157
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:52,530
I didn't say that.

158
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,850
But I was like, you know, I shot my shot, you know?

159
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,710
Always shoot your shot, you know?

160
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:02,350
My goal is so, you know, the worst thing you can say is no.

161
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:11,330
So I was trying to shoot my shot and be like, oh, hey, can I, like, um, you know, be invited to, to the next preview for it?

162
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,730
Because I heard that, like, you know, the new season's coming out.

163
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,070
So that means the new preview's coming out.

164
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,830
And they're like, oh, so I already selected the streamers.

165
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:22,510
Um, but, like, you know, if anybody can make it, we'll, we'll have you in mine.

166
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,370
And then I was like, oh, it's okay.

167
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,890
But then, like, I still have the general streamer.

168
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:27,910
I just don't get paid for it.

169
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,430
But that also means I can stream it on YouTube, you know?

170
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:31,930
Yeah.

171
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:36,930
So, um, so there's two things, one, two versions.

172
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:42,910
There's one where it's like the early streamer preview, where they get it earlier than the general preview, early access.

173
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:46,350
So general early access, no one gets paid to test it out.

174
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:51,030
But the, the, the real streamer access, people get, we get paid for that.

175
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:51,910
So it's sponsored.

176
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:57,030
And you're playing with other content creators, you know, like other big content creators and other streamers.

177
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:05,890
Like, like when I did the one last time, I got in my, I got invited with like huge content creators, like ones that are in like Kaisenats groups and stuff like that.

178
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:16,590
Like people who were in the Kaisenat group or like, um, um, and like, uh, the really, really big content creators that has like millions and millions of followers and stuff.

179
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:20,930
So like, um, there's that one and you get paid to do that.

180
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:25,790
And they get the early access two hours before the general early access.

181
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,730
So I was like, eh.

182
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,430
And then they were like, sorry, we already selected our streamer.

183
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,350
So I was like, oh.

184
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,770
I was like, ah.

185
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:43,190
But I still have the general early access, which I don't get paid to do, but I get to be on YouTube.

186
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:47,870
That's two hours after the streamer preview.

187
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:00,090
So we're gonna... It's like 4 p.m.

188
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:00,770
PSC.

189
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:03,730
So we'll... Yeah, it was worth the try, you know?

190
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,290
It was worth the try.

191
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:08,750
Like I said, it doesn't hurt to shoot your shot, you know?

192
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:09,270
It doesn't hurt.

193
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,430
The worst thing to say is no.

194
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:14,210
And they said no, but they were like, we'll keep you in mind for the next one.

195
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:15,650
Like for other events.

196
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,610
I was like, yippee!

197
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:22,710
But yeah, there was that.

198
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:28,410
And so an extra stream on the 4th.

199
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,270
Oh, sorry, not the 4th.

200
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:29,850
On the 3rd.

201
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,810
An extra stream on the 3rd at 4 p.m.

202
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:35,290
PSC for the new Marvel Rivals early access for Phoenix.

203
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:37,970
For Phoenix.

204
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:39,670
And it's gonna be on YouTube.

205
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:40,790
That one's not gonna be on Twitch.

206
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,590
The Mechabrick stream will be on Twitch, though.

207
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:42,950
It's crazy.

208
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:46,270
A lot of the sponsors have been lately going towards Twitch rather than YouTube.

209
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,470
Because of like Twitch drops.

210
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:52,710
And because there's, you know, Twitch drops is easier for Twitch drops.

211
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,330
And they want to boost the category up for the viewer count.

212
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,650
Because, you know, they're sponsoring a lot of people.

213
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:01,410
And usually it's more so of like, they want the category to be like higher.

214
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:04,670
So a lot of them tend to not want it on YouTube.

215
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:17,350
I found out, other than Gacha, Gacha is mostly on YouTube because like, I guess it's more so like, I guess it's like more so of like, it's, Gacha tends to not have Twitch drops.

216
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:24,270
So like, they're more okay with it be on YouTube and even, and it is like where majority of my audiences are.

217
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,870
So I thought that was really interesting.

218
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:36,410
But a lot of, a lot of games that are non-Gacha tends to want me to stream on Twitch due to like, you know, the category and, uh, and like Twitch drops.

219
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,070
So it's like, it makes more sense.

220
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:44,890
So it's like, when I was sponsored by Marvel Rivals, they also wanted me to be on Twitch as well because of like Twitch drops plus the category.

221
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:52,230
Um, yeah, so, speaking of Gacha game, my fucking Twitter feed is all about the goddamn horse game.

222
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:52,750
Um,

223
00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:12,710
like, I knew that game is really popular, was already really, really popular in Japan, but like, it recently hit, like, the servers, uh, English servers recently went live, um, in N.A., and everybody is fucking playing it and talking about it.

224
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:20,350
And like, I, um, I was curious because I was like, okay, um, but it was like, I don't, there's no gameplay.

225
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:39,860
Like, I'm sorry, but I, I like, like, one of my friends was trying to, trying to convince me, I was trying to, there is, you're blind.

226
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:52,740
Um, but, they tried to convince me, and I was, I was literally just, wait, we're, wait, are we just watching?

227
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,020
Oh, I understand that they're making a lot of money.

228
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:12,440
I understand the Gacha purposes of the game, but I was like, wait, oh,

229
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,100
I understand what gameplay you guys are talking about.

230
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:35,860
But, it has, Lord, Doki, you gotta read it, it's not, it's not just about the game, Doki, it's about raising your horse so she can be the idol that she was meant to be.

231
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,040
Is that it, guys?

232
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,840
Is it, is that it?

233
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:47,800
Okay, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you, Doki, think of it this way.

234
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:56,460
Uma Musume, pretty derby, is a roguelike horse training simulator with cute girls, thank you for this super chat, thank you, thank you.

235
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,680
No name.

236
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,600
Thank you for the super chat.

237
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,560
Thank you, thank you.

238
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,220
But where's the gameplay?

239
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,260
Gameplay?

240
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,640
And then, but like, I was watching like the horse racing part.

241
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:15,800
And, um, I thought it was, like, it's just, it's just legal horse...

242
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,100
It's legal horse racing.

243
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:21,500
So like, you can, you can play it no matter what age.

244
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,420
And it's all legal.

245
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:29,560
Um, it still has the, uh, it still has the debt ramifications of horse betting.

246
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,860
You could potentially go broke just like horse betting.

247
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:42,340
But instead of, you know, going to the derby and watching it on TV.

248
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,120
You watch it on your monitor, on your PC or your phone.

249
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,460
Yeah, no Yakuza to worry about.

250
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:57,540
And you can bet on your favorite horse girl at any age you want.

251
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,940
Now you get it!

252
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:05,560
Because when I was watching, I was like, oh shit, this is like basically actual horse racing.

253
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,200
But they just swapped, they just turned them into anime horse girls.

254
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,600
Uh, GoldenFoxy, thank you for the super chat.

255
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,640
Thank you, thank you.

256
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:16,040
Uh, since horse racing is another form of gambling, it makes sense.

257
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:16,480
Gotcha.

258
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,240
Like it.

259
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,740
Thank you for the super chat.

260
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,920
Thank you, thank you.

261
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:30,000
Um, uh, but yeah, I thought, I thought that.

262
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,040
I know like, like my friend was like, you should play on stream.

263
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,780
I was like, I'm not gonna play, I'm sorry guys.

264
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,580
I'm not gonna play on stream.

265
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,440
And I know for sure they'll never sponsor me for this.

266
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:42,560
Because they make enough money right now off of NA.

267
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:48,320
They're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they make enough money in NA.

268
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,920
And obviously, they do not need extra publicity.

269
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,660
Uh, Cindy, thank you for the super chat.

270
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:55,960
Thank you, thank you.

271
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,960
I'm subscribing because I'm not gonna play the hoist girl game.

272
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:06,120
I, you know I won't, you know I won't spend money on this guys.

273
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,400
You know I, I won't spend money on it.

274
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,000
Um.

275
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:15,880
Hi Doki, did you find 11 other members for your B12 music video?

276
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,960
Thank you for the super chat.

277
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:17,840
Thank you, thank you.

278
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,140
Oh my God, you know who like instantly showed up in my DMs.

279
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:32,260
When I, when I tweet, someone instantly showed up in my DMs when I, when I tweeted about it.

280
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:42,700
I, I won't say who, but she was very, very into actually wanting to make this a reality.

281
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,440
That's all I'll say.

282
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:44,920
uh.

283
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:49,960
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

284
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,180
Uh.

285
00:19:50,680 --> 00:20:02,620
Uh... Apparently, she has been like, obsessed with the, the song, like, B12 for, yeah, she's been obsessed with that song for a while now.

286
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,660
And ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

287
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:09,120
And she's like, if you are serious, I want in.

288
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:13,260
And I was just like...

289
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:19,880
Because obviously, my intentions for making that tweet was originally as a shitpost.

290
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:24,740
But, like, a lot of people were actually so, like, really wanted to make that real.

291
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:32,240
I was very surprised that, like, that tweet, like, blew up.

292
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,420
Because I've been shitposting the last couple of days.

293
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,440
So I was very surprised.

294
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,920
Thank you for the super chat.

295
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:40,740
Thank you, thank you.

296
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,060
You have to do it now.

297
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,400
Thank you for the super chat.

298
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,480
Thank you, thank you.

299
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:52,120
But, yeah, I'll just say that her hair was pastel.

300
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,280
Of a pink variety.

301
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,380
Anyway...

302
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,780
What else did I want to say?

303
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,520
There was something else I wanted to talk about.

304
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,340
Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.

305
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,600
Fuck, what was it?

306
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,180
Also, I'm really sad.

307
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,960
I'm really mad that Pom Pom Perun won the Sandoval contest.

308
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:14,920
That fucking whore.

309
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:15,460
That...

310
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,460
He only won because he showed his ass.

311
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,440
And you all know it.

312
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,780
You all know it.

313
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,280
He was fucking flying that shit everywhere during the Sani World contest.

314
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,600
Fuck that dog.

315
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,040
My dog should have won, guys.

316
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,560
My dog should have won.

317
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,800
Not that dog.

318
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,260
My dog.

319
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,880
Don't hate the player.

320
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,600
Join that booty around.

321
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,460
Goddamn slut.

322
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,240
No, he has to win all the time.

323
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,820
He deserves it.

324
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,540
He's the people's dog.

325
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:06,220
He did what he had to do.

326
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,240
RMD.

327
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,160
Thank you for the super chat.

328
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:08,480
Thank you.

329
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:08,980
Thank you.

330
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,840
Perfect opportunity to stream Barbie horse adventures.

331
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,500
Get a competing horse girl game narrative going.

332
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,660
Thank you for the super chat.

333
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:18,300
Thank you.

334
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,160
Thank you.

335
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:25,160
The fact that... Okay, what was it even worse?

336
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,000
Like, where the fuck did Pochaco come from?

337
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,380
I was like, who the fuck?

338
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,800
I was like, who the fuck wrote it for goddamn Pochaco?

339
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,520
Where the fuck did that guy come in to get third place?

340
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,800
I was so surprised.

341
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,340
I was so surprised.

342
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,440
I was like, where's my queen, Kuromi?

343
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:43,660
Uh, do no one like goth girls anymore?

344
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,280
What happened?

345
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,140
Oh, where did he come from?

346
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:52,220
Like, Pochaco came out of nowhere with a goddamn chair.

347
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,740
Uh, Pochaco fat here.

348
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,360
None of this Pochaco.

349
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,620
He is a generic dog.

350
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,640
It's not even that special.

351
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,020
Uh, that's right.

352
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,660
I'm coming for all of you guys.

353
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:06,620
I...

354
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,300
I...

355
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,380
Um...

356
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:13,940
Um...

357
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,880
The two Pochaco fans in chat.

358
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,260
I was just like, I can't believe...

359
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,240
Where did Pochaco come from?

360
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,180
Like, I... He was never popular and then suddenly he is third?

361
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,440
I was so surprised.

362
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,100
I was like, how did he become third?

363
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,120
He was never popular in the first place.

364
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,460
I don't understand.

365
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,660
He is...

366
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:39,100
He is special in my eyes.

367
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:42,840
I am very passionate about this.

368
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,860
Also, um, I forgot to mention about the concert.

369
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,140
Uh, uh, you're so good at social media, Doki.

370
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,200
Powerful.

371
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,400
Thank you for the super chat.

372
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:52,760
Thank you.

373
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,320
Thank you.

374
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,000
I...

375
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,820
The...

376
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,040
I don't know what got into me.

377
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:01,400
Every time I actually, like, want to do something on social media, I just pop off.

378
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,160
I...

379
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,340
I just...

380
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:09,400
It's like, I just shitpost, like, once or twice a year.

381
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,540
Like, like, once or twice, maybe, like, every two to three months.

382
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:15,120
I just shitpost, like, tweet, like, one or two things.

383
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,680
And then it pops off.

384
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,760
And then I disappear.

385
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:18,920
I...

386
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:21,800
I just...

387
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,300
I disappear after that.

388
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,760
Back to just retweeting.

389
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,620
And tweeting out my waiting rooms.

390
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:29,620
And I'm like, oh shit, speaking of that, let me be, like, live now.

391
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,220
Uh, don't slander my boy Pochaco.

392
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,860
He came out of nowhere!

393
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,660
He's been, like, bottom of the leaderboards for fucking years!

394
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:41,380
And then, like, suddenly he's third place?

395
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,500
Like, what the fuck?

396
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,000
Okay, that is...

397
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,940
That's, like, an inside job or some shit.

398
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,920
Okay, anyway, let me type, live now.

399
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,680
Live now!

400
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,040
All right.

401
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,660
All right, there we go.

402
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,920
Um, yeah.

403
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,120
I thought...

404
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:00,980
What was that?

405
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,620
Oh, yeah, the concert.

406
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,960
By the way, okay, so...

407
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,500
I talked about this in member stream.

408
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,340
But if you were going to...

409
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,700
Sorry, there's a lot of updates.

410
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,500
Sorry, guys.

411
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:12,380
But if you were going to...

412
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,540
Anime Expo.

413
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:14,540
All right.

414
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,480
So, this is not just a blob.

415
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:17,540
Okay, so...

416
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,980
So, here is the venue for...

417
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,860
Um, Anime Expo.

418
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:23,540
The concert.

419
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,280
Which, by the way, I'm so fucking tired from...

420
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,540
From planning this and preparing for this.

421
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,520
I am so tired.

422
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,200
There's so much going in.

423
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:32,800
Anyway.

424
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,940
As you can see, there is no...

425
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,360
If you were going to Anime Expo concert...

426
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,380
The best seats are not the center.

427
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,400
If you want to watch the concert itself...

428
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,180
It's the side seats right here.

429
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:43,820
If you're...

430
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,000
You got the front row...

431
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,200
You have to get these seats right here.

432
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,440
Like, uh...

433
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,020
Like...

434
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:49,340
Sorry.

435
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,020
These seats right here are the best seats.

436
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:52,880
Because there is the screen.

437
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,600
Because, um...

438
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,740
The side seats are meta.

439
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,220
It's not the center seats.

440
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:57,780
Uh...

441
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:58,800
It's the side seats.

442
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,040
So, if you're going to Anime Expo for my birthday concert...

443
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,080
Um...

444
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,540
On July 3rd...

445
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,760
You get the side seats.

446
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,640
The reason being is that...

447
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,080
We try to make it...

448
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,480
Get the center screen.

449
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,280
Um...

450
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:12,520
Uh...

451
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,680
The Watage people will be here on this stage.

452
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,540
You can see here.

453
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,180
Right here.

454
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,660
That's where the Watage people will be at.

455
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,540
Performing.

456
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,440
Right here in the center.

457
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,240
So...

458
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,620
The reason why...

459
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:22,960
Uh...

460
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,120
We don't have a center screen.

461
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,040
We try...

462
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,620
We asked Anime Expo...

463
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,160
If we could...

464
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:29,740
Um...

465
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,420
We could get a center screen.

466
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,080
Because it's going to be like, you know...

467
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:33,380
A...

468
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,760
A VTuber concert.

469
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,100
And they were like...

470
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:36,640
Yeah, you can.

471
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,180
You can.

472
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:37,660
Absolutely.

473
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,440
We're fine with that.

474
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,280
And then we asked the Fire Marshals...

475
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:40,780
And the Union.

476
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,980
And they said no.

477
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,740
Now, I'm not against Unions.

478
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:45,740
But I...

479
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:47,500
Disclaimer.

480
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,380
I'm not against Unions.

481
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:49,960
But...

482
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,700
I was like...

483
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,020
Why the fuck am I not allowed?

484
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:53,560
That was...

485
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,240
There's like...

486
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,120
10...

487
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:55,920
There's like...

488
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,400
20 plus...

489
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:57,980
Exits.

490
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:58,820
I was like...

491
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,300
Why the...

492
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,300
I was like...

493
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,840
What would the center...

494
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,440
Like...

495
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,860
Why is it...

496
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:06,260
Like...

497
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,960
Why can't we have a center screen?

498
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,240
And they're like...

499
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:09,960
Apparently...

500
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,100
We were told that...

501
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,360
And we were told about this like...

502
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,800
The last couple...

503
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,320
Of days.

504
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:14,820
Like...

505
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,160
It was like the last couple days ago...

506
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,740
That we were told about this super last minute.

507
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,000
Um...

508
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,160
Stop slut-shaming Pruitt just because you're Oshi lost.

509
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,700
What a shame, Toki.

510
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,760
Loli, thank you for the Super Chat.

511
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,220
Thank you.

512
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:28,880
Thank you.

513
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:29,500
Okay.

514
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:35,340
Anyway, they were saying that it's too much work.

515
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:41,120
And there's too much work and like, you know, potential for fire.

516
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:48,410
And I was like, how the fuck would that happen?

517
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:51,090
I was just like, okay, I was like, but we'll pay for it.

518
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:54,090
And they're like, we literally said we'll pay for it.

519
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:56,650
That's what we told them.

520
00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:00,270
That we will pay for it.

521
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:02,170
I mean, look how I can count the exits.

522
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:08,730
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.

523
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:10,550
There's like, I don't know, I might have counted more than one.

524
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:12,170
There's like at least 20 exits.

525
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:35,430
So because of that, um, we're trying to figure out solutions, um, we're trying to figure out solutions on like what to do for the center screen because we already put so much work into this concert, like money wise and like practicing and everything for it.

526
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,370
I'm so tired.

527
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:39,330
So I'm so tired.

528
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:49,270
And so, um, so they're like, you can't, you can't put us, you can't rent a center screen or anything because of it.

529
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:53,730
So we're like, okay, then, and then me and my staff were like, what do we do?

530
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:04,810
Anyway, uh, anyway, so I was, I suggested at first we're like, oh, we could have like displays and stuff like that.

531
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:11,330
Like cutouts, like live, like giant stands on me and then get cosplayers and stuff like that.

532
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:22,850
And then I was like, what if we get, uh, Watage people there, like, you know, performing to the song since we have the center stage open, you know, like, it's literally there, like, it's open, it's a blank area.

533
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:26,030
So they're like, we're like, so then it was super last minute.

534
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:34,650
We actually got confirmation yesterday night on like whether or not they could like come because like it was incredibly last minute and everything.

535
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,670
So they're like, yeah, we can do it.

536
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:42,730
We can do that since they're already heading to, and the best, the great thing about it was that they're already heading to Anime Expo as well.

537
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:49,530
So like, it was just convenient timing for us and them because, uh, they were already heading there.

538
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:52,590
So like, it's just like, you know, something they could do while they're there already.

539
00:29:52,870 --> 00:30:00,890
So, um, so they're going to be performing on the center stage alongside the concert where they gave them the set list and everything.

540
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:04,430
So they know what song is going to be.

541
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:06,590
So they are going to be preparing for that.

542
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:10,390
And yeah, so it's something extra for those who are going to the concert.

543
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,930
It's just, you know, an extra experience.

544
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:23,190
When the video, when the vibe of the concert itself is going to be on my channel later, obviously you guys won't see the Watage things.

545
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:25,230
Because that's like on the venue.

546
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:30,630
So this is like a little extra something for those who are there at Anime Expo.

547
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:34,710
So, yeah, but anyway.

548
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:39,550
Yeah, so I hope everybody will enjoy the Anime Expo concert.

549
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,270
For those who can't make it, don't worry.

550
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:51,230
The video of the concert, of the performance itself, will be published on my channel at a later date when we refine it more.

551
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:57,190
I just need you guys to remember that this concert was literally done in less than a month.

552
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:02,150
Actually no, we had just a month to do all of this.

553
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:07,230
So, it was crazy.

554
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:11,550
Like, usually concerts take a lot more time.

555
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:18,610
Especially with like songs, choreo, dancing, motion capture, production.

556
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,970
That is like, it's crazy.

557
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:26,270
I managed to do all of this with a team of people in a month.

558
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:31,550
So, we gotta, we have to polish it.

559
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:40,310
We have to polish it after its debut at Anime Expo.

560
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:44,950
Because like, today, um, we're going through stuff today.

561
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:51,290
And I was like, okay, here, like, state the stuff I want to fix on like, the concert stage and stuff like that.

562
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:52,950
And like, the lighting and stuff.

563
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,470
And they're like, yeah, we could do some of this.

564
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:57,670
But like, we can't do all of this because we have two days left.

565
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:00,330
So, I was like, it's fine.

566
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:03,470
We'll, we'll do this after the anime.

567
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:06,550
We'll fix the stage after Anime Expo.

568
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:08,430
Like...

569
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:11,790
Please, girl, you gotta stop doing this yourself.

570
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:13,350
Thank you, Super Chat, JL.

571
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:13,870
Thank you, thank you.

572
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:16,090
Just remember, I'm doing this.

573
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:21,410
Plus, I'm prepping for something special on the birthday itself as well.

574
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:26,610
So, a lot of stuff is going on.

575
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:34,210
Because, um, we're also, I also have stuff I'm doing for my actual birthday stream.

576
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,630
Not just the concert.

577
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:39,610
So, it's like, all like, condensed into the...

578
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:40,730
This week is crazy.

579
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:41,790
I'll just say that.

580
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:43,810
This week is fucking crazy.

581
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,090
It's, it's a lot.

582
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:52,370
It's definitely, um, a lot of stuff going on right now.

583
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:54,930
Anyway, let's actually play Elden Ring.

584
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:55,410
Sorry.

585
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:59,250
We had a very long, very long tangent today.

586
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:01,770
So, let's actually get Elden Ring booted up.

587
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:03,710
Um...

588
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:04,810
No, I'm definitely...

589
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:08,410
After my birthday week, I'm gonna take it a little, um...

590
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:10,410
A little, um...

591
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:12,710
Like...

592
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:15,350
A chiller week after the birthday week.

593
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:18,430
Because of everything that led up to the birthday week.

594
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,330
It was a lot.

595
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:21,410
It was fucking a lot, guys.

596
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:21,990
Uh...

597
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:28,030
Dango, thank you for the super chat.

598
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:28,330
Thank you.

599
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:28,770
Thank you.

600
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:31,370
My health still won't allow me to go to things like off-kind meet and greets.

601
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:33,710
Even though I live down the street from the center or AX.

602
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:35,650
So, this super chat is how I show my support.

603
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:36,850
Thank you for the super chat.

604
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:38,810
Dango, thank you.

605
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:39,510
Thank you.

606
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,730
I'm very appreciative.

607
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,250
I hope...

608
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:42,690
Um...

609
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:43,650
Your health recovers.

610
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:44,930
I really appreciate it.

611
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:46,450
Yeah.

612
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:46,670
No.

613
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:47,970
You will understand.

614
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:48,910
When...

615
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,190
Um...

616
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:51,050
When you see...

617
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:52,350
When I talk about the concert.

618
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:53,890
You'll understand.

619
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:56,670
I mean...

620
00:33:56,670 --> 00:34:01,550
The fact that I got a concert made within a month is already pretty fucking crazy.

621
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:23,790
But, you'll understand when I go into detail about this goddamn concert, you'll... I will leak secrets that they won't tell you... Not won't, but like, usually people don't talk much about how concert planning goes into it, along with like, the motion capture.

622
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:24,890
And the price!

623
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:29,490
Okay, I will review how much it fucking costs!

624
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,090
Like, I'm... I...

625
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:48,510
And like, apparently, by the way, apparently, what I spent on my concert is cheaper than like, how it usually costs, if you like, get it done in Japan.

626
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:52,130
Because my studio is a Chinese studio.

627
00:34:52,490 --> 00:35:02,850
And apparently, I was, I was like, swapping notes with someone else who's, um... With someone else who works with like, Japanese 3D studios.

628
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:06,010
And mine... Was a lot cheaper.

629
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:11,390
And mine was already very expensive.

630
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:17,330
I was like, holy fuck!

631
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:24,050
I... Dookie, are you having, uh, Wotage performers with planned choreo?

632
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:26,990
Or just fans doing... No, they're, they're an actual group.

633
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:29,810
Uh, they have my set list, so they're planning something around it.

634
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:31,230
But thank you for the super chat, JP.

635
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:31,970
Thank you, thank you.

636
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,110
They're like, an actual... Professional group that does it.

637
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:39,310
Um... That does it like, quite often for like, other... Uh, places.

638
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:41,410
Like, other... They did like a performance in OffGuy.

639
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:42,770
Uh, so, yeah.

640
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:45,930
Um... Alright, where do we go?

641
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:47,610
I'm so fucking lost.

642
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:49,990
Where... Do we go here?

643
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:59,690
I went to... I went to Chinese studio, because, um... Um...

644
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:05,630
Because, like, um... It was based off of, like... Gacha games.

645
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:07,990
And, like, how their mocap is done.

646
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:10,310
And the 3D for gacha games and mocap.

647
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:17,270
So, I was like... I felt like, um... Now, recently, like... The technology for it.

648
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:20,070
For, like... Chinese, like, gacha games.

649
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:21,370
And 3D technology.

650
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,090
Is, like, super good.

651
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:24,810
So, I... Oh, this tree?

652
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:25,150
Okay.

653
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:29,330
So, I went... So, that's why I went with a... Uh, with a Chinese studio.

654
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:33,430
And also, like... I could speak to them.

655
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:34,490
You know?

656
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:38,570
Like... I could communicate with them better.

657
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:39,210
Yeah.

658
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:44,490
They definitely... Um... I feel like the motion capture in, like, 3D got a lot better.

659
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:45,050
Too.

660
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:49,530
I wonder how... How do I make it so I use 2?

661
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:53,290
Do I do, like... How do I make it so I use 2?

662
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:53,670
Okay.

663
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:54,370
Okay.

664
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:56,010
So, it's L... Yeah.

665
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:58,510
So, I have... I'm trying to, like...

666
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:59,670
Oh, my god.

667
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:01,150
I'm trying to use this sword.

668
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:03,330
Okay.

669
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:04,130
Alright.

670
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:05,750
This is the first time using this sword.

671
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:07,210
So, the double katana.

672
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:08,550
Alright.

673
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:09,450
Oh, that's good.

674
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:10,170
Alright.

675
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:13,250
I spoke Canto.

676
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:14,490
I speak Canto.

677
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:16,310
But, like, I can hear Mandarin.

678
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:19,790
And... And, like, I can speak a little bit of Mandarin.

679
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:22,170
And also, um...

680
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:27,410
Um... And also, I have staff members that can speak Chinese.

681
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:31,050
And also, they speak English.

682
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:36,190
In the end, I... They also speak English.

683
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:38,450
So, like, I didn't need all that anyway.

684
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:40,410
Uh...

685
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:44,050
In the end, the staff ended up speaking English to me.

686
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,310
So, that was nice.

687
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:48,510
I didn't have to, uh, get a translator at all.

688
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,730
That... That helped a lot, you know?

689
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:54,630
Like, I was prepared.

690
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:57,130
They grabbed, like, staff and stuff and everything.

691
00:37:57,130 --> 00:38:00,230
But, in the end, they also speak English as well.

692
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,450
So, that... That helped.

693
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:02,830
Um...

694
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:03,690
I remember when I was, like...

695
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:06,470
I was, like, scouting out for 3D Studios.

696
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:11,430
I had to add, like, a Japanese translator to help me with, um...

697
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:15,930
To help me with, like, communicating with the JP Studios.

698
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:18,610
But, uh, when I went for...

699
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:20,470
I... When I looked for a Chinese...

700
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:22,470
Like, when I, you know, look at my various options...

701
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:25,230
That was also the only reason why I picked the studio.

702
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:26,630
Because they also speak English.

703
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:28,130
So, I was, like, oh, that's cool.

704
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:28,650
I don't...

705
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:29,230
You know?

706
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:30,330
I was, like, oh, that's cool.

707
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:34,150
Thank God.

708
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:37,110
So, there's no, like, miscommunication and stuff.

709
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:39,730
Uh...

710
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:42,110
Alright.

711
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:42,930
That's stuff.

712
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:44,610
And I'm just going forward.

713
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:45,830
Am I...

714
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:47,230
I need to double check something.

715
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:50,050
To make sure the graphics are okay.

716
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:51,730
Uh...

717
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:51,850
Yeah.

718
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:54,990
It's portless, window, advanced settings.

719
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:55,630
Okay.

720
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:56,750
I don't know if I...

721
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:57,210
Oh, wait.

722
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:57,470
Wait.

723
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:58,030
Give me a sec.

724
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:58,930
I know what to do.

725
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:00,290
It's gonna save.

726
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:02,230
Feels a little off.

727
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:02,670
Okay.

728
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:03,350
That should be better.

729
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:04,110
Alright.

730
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:05,770
Darkblade, thank you for the super chat.

731
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:06,070
Thank you.

732
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:07,590
I'm gonna yell at you.

733
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:09,910
So, I'm sending this for more womanbird tomato thing.

734
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:12,730
Why do you spend so much money to make us happy?

735
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:13,830
Because...

736
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:14,250
YOLO.

737
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:14,870
Haha.

738
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:16,790
Thank you for the super chat, Darkblade.

739
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:17,230
Thank you.

740
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:17,950
Thank you.

741
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:19,250
YOLO.

742
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:19,710
You know?

743
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:22,290
I don't know how long I'm gonna be...

744
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:23,670
this...

745
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:24,630
popular...

746
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,190
I guess?

747
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,270
I don't know when exactly.

748
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:29,290
OH my God!

749
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:29,870
He...

750
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,130
Holy shit!

751
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:32,410
He slam tucked me!

752
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:35,970
I don't know how long I'm gonna be, like...

753
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:38,570
Um, oh my god.

754
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:42,170
Until I fall off, so I'm making the best out of it.

755
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:47,010
I wanna know, like, how much... how much does he give?

756
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:50,770
Oh my god, this fucking guy who slam dunked me.

757
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:53,270
How much was that?

758
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:55,730
Wait, that's... I don't even know how much he gave me there.

759
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:59,130
I never saw it coming, to be fair.

760
00:39:59,350 --> 00:39:59,570
I never...

761
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:02,570
That's right.

762
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:04,870
You wanna ban me?

763
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:06,250
Get out of here.

764
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:08,370
Oh wait, there's a map right here.

765
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:09,530
That's actually what we needed.

766
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:11,650
Oh, that's really good.

767
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:13,850
Also, like, I watched an Elden Ring playthrough.

768
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:17,530
Uh, well, it wasn't necessarily an Elden Ring playthrough.

769
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:21,090
Okay, since playing Elden Ring, I'm getting recommended a lot of fucking Elden Ring videos.

770
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:24,650
But they have the most clickbaity goddamn titles that they always get me.

771
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:26,250
They always fucking get me.

772
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:32,950
They always get me to goddamn click the video, and they know it.

773
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:36,450
Anyway, so, one of the video was like...

774
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:40,550
I saw, it was like, um...

775
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:43,790
I beat Elden Ring by only level one stat.

776
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,290
And it's like, strength.

777
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,090
I was like, bro, what the fuck?

778
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:52,830
So I was like, bro, that can't be.

779
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:56,130
How the fuck did this man fucking beat Elden Ring?

780
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:58,550
Love that one stat.

781
00:40:58,950 --> 00:40:59,810
And it's strength.

782
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:00,730
And he's like...

783
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:03,090
Ungabunga.

784
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:03,870
Me...

785
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:05,850
Me pound you with hammer.

786
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:07,950
Because he carries, like, a giant...

787
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:08,430
Goddamn.

788
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:09,730
Oh my god, I missed the bird.

789
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:11,030
He is...

790
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:12,670
I missed the third bird.

791
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:13,710
God fucking damn.

792
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:14,810
And...

793
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:16,210
Gronk.

794
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:16,490
Kill.

795
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:17,990
Like, big bonk.

796
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:18,950
And...

797
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:22,390
He is like...

798
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:23,210
It was like...

799
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:24,570
All strength.

800
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:26,530
And it was literally, like...

801
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:28,090
Fucking...

802
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:31,290
With giant ass armor.

803
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:32,990
With no...

804
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,030
A giant ass hammer.

805
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:35,770
With no...

806
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:36,750
Goddamn...

807
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:37,910
Um...

808
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:41,710
There was no fucking stats on anything else.

809
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:43,670
And he wasn't wearing armor, too.

810
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:44,910
Um...

811
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:46,310
He's just...

812
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:51,470
He's like...

813
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:52,130
Grog smash.

814
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:55,490
Anyways, so...

815
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:55,930
I will...

816
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,510
That video popped up.

817
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:57,890
And I was like...

818
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:58,370
Are you fucking...

819
00:41:58,370 --> 00:41:59,150
And then...

820
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:01,210
What pissed me off the most...

821
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:02,110
Was that...

822
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:05,050
He beat the entire fucking game...

823
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:05,790
In...

824
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:06,450
Eight hours.

825
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:09,170
With less than a hundred deaths.

826
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:10,010
Like...

827
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:10,850
Oh my god.

828
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:11,590
That's...

829
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:13,310
That's what pissed me off the most.

830
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:14,270
Oh hey, it's two...

831
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:15,290
It's a witch.

832
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:16,410
Uh...

833
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:16,850
The...

834
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:17,010
Two...

835
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:17,530
Two toes.

836
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:18,670
Um...

837
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:18,990
Hahaha.

838
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:23,130
I was like...

839
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:23,750
Are you...

840
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:24,950
Fucking kidding me?

841
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:26,050
He...

842
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:28,230
All he had was strength!

843
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:30,950
And he fucking won the game!

844
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:31,770
In...

845
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:32,750
Less than...

846
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:33,510
Eight hours!

847
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:35,610
No armor!

848
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,470
What about my fingers?

849
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:46,470
Yeah?

850
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:47,590
We're gonna see my hands?

851
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:49,610
Thank you.

852
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:50,630
Is this...

853
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:52,090
Is this a fetish thing?

854
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,740
Ruins of gold...

855
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:03,050
To the west...

856
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:06,600
The serpent's sacrilege...

857
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,600
Wherever the path leads...

858
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:16,960
So shall you follow...

859
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,440
Wherever the path leads...

860
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,820
Only more...

861
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:24,220
Oh!

862
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,420
She's telling me where the story bosses are.

863
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:28,980
Tis a curse...

864
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:30,220
A curse...

865
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:30,500
A curse...

866
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:30,660
A curse...

867
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:31,400
You okay, ma'am?

868
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,220
The curse of...

869
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:34,140
Queen...

870
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:35,200
Marika!

871
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,020
Oh no...

872
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:46,470
Have you ever thought about...

873
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:47,570
Not being sad?

874
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:55,450
More?

875
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:55,570
What?

876
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:57,970
Why do you want to see more of my fingers?

877
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:02,030
Oh no, that's... one is enough.

878
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:03,670
You got to pay for the second time.

879
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:05,950
You were... Okay, so...

880
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:10,710
Guys, she just cured the... Yeah, have you ever thought about not being sad?

881
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:22,110
Also, like, another one that popped up in my recommended was one where it was like...

882
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:24,670
There was a mod where you can just have a gun.

883
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:31,770
And I was this close...

884
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:36,950
I was this fucking close to installing that mod...

885
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:40,570
But I found out that you have to restart your game if you...

886
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:47,850
Like, like, I literally wanted to start today's playthrough with, like, just a gun...

887
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:50,890
There's, like, it's basically a mod where you have a gun...

888
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:52,330
And a tank...

889
00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:52,610
And a...

890
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:53,670
And a fighter jack...

891
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:54,810
And a...

892
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:56,390
And a fucking nuke...

893
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:56,930
And I was...

894
00:44:56,930 --> 00:44:58,430
And I was this close...

895
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:00,870
And I saw, like, a playthrough of that...

896
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:05,070
And I was this close to, like, installing that mod today...

897
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:06,410
Like, for today's stream...

898
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:07,840
And just started out with...

899
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:09,620
Just like, hey, guys...

900
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:11,620
So now I have a gun...

901
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:12,460
I...

902
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,440
It was...

903
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,820
I was so close, guys...

904
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:18,420
I was all...

905
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:19,420
I saw...

906
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:20,580
I was like, oh my god...

907
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:22,540
I could have a gun right now...

908
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:24,500
Xanatos...

909
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:24,940
Xanatos, thank you...

910
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:26,160
Five gifted...

911
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,200
Of my ships...

912
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,100
Thank you, thank you...

913
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:32,180
Xanatos, thank you, Superchild...

914
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:32,800
Thank you, thank you...

915
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:33,820
Today's a special day...

916
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:34,920
And I want to share it with you all...

917
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:35,540
That is right...

918
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:36,680
It is my birthday...

919
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,340
Happy birthday, Xanatos!

920
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,200
Happy birthday to you...

921
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,840
Happy birthday to you...

922
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:46,400
Happy birthday, dear Xanatos...

923
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,300
Happy birthday to you...

924
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:48,600
Yeah!

925
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:49,460
Happy birthday!

926
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:49,660
Yay!

927
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:52,160
I have a great birthday.

928
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,440
Anton, thank you for the super chat.

929
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:55,280
Thank you, thank you.

930
00:45:55,340 --> 00:46:01,600
It's a good thing you didn't because unless you use a seamless co-op or offline, the mod would have instantly banned your Steam account.

931
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,360
No more phrases.

932
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:08,720
Yeah, but I couldn't have a... I couldn't have a gun though, guys.

933
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,580
Oh, did I go the wrong way?

934
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:11,660
That's... that's alright.

935
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,300
I can just teleport back.

936
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:17,760
That's alright.

937
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:20,140
For he's a jolly good fellow.

938
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:21,980
For he's a jolly good fellow.

939
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,640
For he's a jolly good fellow.

940
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,840
Ba dum ba dum ba dum.

941
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:30,780
If only I had a gun.

942
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:33,080
Shogun.

943
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,340
Alright, lump of flesh.

944
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,680
Where the fuck do I go now?

945
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,060
I'm so lost.

946
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:42,400
Alright.

947
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:48,990
Okay, this is a giant hill.

948
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:51,050
Alright.

949
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:52,790
Go down here.

950
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:55,470
I think I could.

951
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:58,590
I can make it.

952
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:01,230
Oh, yeah.

953
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:01,890
There you go.

954
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:07,950
Okay.

955
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:10,510
That was... that was bait.

956
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:12,950
It just seemed like I made it.

957
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:17,530
That was... I was like, oh shit.

958
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:18,210
Yeah, I did it.

959
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:22,830
Okay, that... that was fucking bait.

960
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:26,870
Cause it like... it looked like I made it at the end.

961
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:29,110
And then I touched the last area.

962
00:47:29,370 --> 00:47:30,890
The last floor.

963
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:35,110
I knew gravity.

964
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:37,390
It felt like... I don't know.

965
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:40,790
It felt like I just lived for some reason.

966
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:42,430
Alright.

967
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:45,050
The bats are back, guys.

968
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:45,550
Oh my god.

969
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:47,690
That was a giant ass bat there that killed me.

970
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:48,430
Chat.

971
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:52,890
Um... Sydney, thank you for the super chat.

972
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:53,290
Thank you.

973
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:54,050
Thank you.

974
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:56,330
Joki's modern warfare build.

975
00:47:56,490 --> 00:47:59,350
Firing RPGs at the stupid snake.

976
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:00,930
Thank you for the super chat.

977
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:01,330
Thank you.

978
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:02,070
Thank you.

979
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:03,830
Where the fuck do I go?

980
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:06,830
There has to be a bottom somewhere.

981
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:08,490
Okay, I'm getting... I'm getting horse out.

982
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:10,450
Horse, tell me where to go.

983
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:14,670
Maybe down here?

984
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:19,010
What the fuck?

985
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,380
Yeah, there it is.

986
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:25,840
But like, how do I get there?

987
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:30,800
Where does that go?

988
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:32,860
Oh, it's here.

989
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:33,720
Okay, I found it.

990
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:35,820
Okay.

991
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,320
I'm curious about these guys.

992
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,760
Okay, I might be... Okay, there we go.

993
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:43,720
Okay, I'll do here and then we'll go from here.

994
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:44,840
Alright, we figured it out.

995
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:46,860
Guys, we found the bottom.

996
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:48,860
Okay.

997
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:52,760
Alright, there we go.

998
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:53,800
I figured it out.

999
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:55,260
I did a flip.

1000
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:56,340
And everything.

1001
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:59,220
Alright, and then...

1002
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,000
We should be able to head to the giant ass...

1003
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:01,820
Fucking tree.

1004
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:02,880
Right?

1005
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:03,760
Is the tree over here?

1006
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:05,580
Wait, where did the tree go?

1007
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,000
Wait, where did the big ass...

1008
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,260
Oh, the tree's to my right.

1009
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,540
Okay, we're going this way now.

1010
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:14,320
Uh...

1011
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:15,840
Okay.

1012
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:18,380
Okay, the tree's above me.

1013
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:22,960
Okay, we went...

1014
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,960
Alright, we went the wrong way.

1015
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:27,360
We went...

1016
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:30,080
Guys, the tree was apparently above me.

1017
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:30,580
Guys.

1018
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:33,780
Alright.

1019
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:34,620
Maybe...

1020
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:36,420
Guys, maybe there's a way here.

1021
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:37,220
Maybe...

1022
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:38,200
Guys, I...

1023
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,120
This is not a filler episode, guys.

1024
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,020
I swear to God.

1025
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:41,580
We're...

1026
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:43,680
We're past the filler episode.

1027
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:46,600
Okay, but there's another tree here, though.

1028
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,440
What about the tree above me?

1029
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,020
What about this tree?

1030
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,940
Is there anything special with the tree up here?

1031
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:04,280
Wait, I don't like how there's health beetles around here.

1032
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:05,780
I don't like that.

1033
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:08,620
Oh.

1034
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:13,770
He's pretty big.

1035
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:15,790
Oh, my God.

1036
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:16,630
Are you okay, buddy?

1037
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:18,570
Okay, he seems pretty sick, too.

1038
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:19,370
I...

1039
00:50:23,410 --> 00:50:24,470
Oh, my gosh.

1040
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:25,070
Oh, wait.

1041
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:26,130
These are little guys.

1042
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:26,750
Wait.

1043
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:27,910
Wait.

1044
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:29,130
Is that guy a boss?

1045
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:30,110
Okay, let's find out.

1046
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:32,010
I'm curious.

1047
00:50:34,710 --> 00:50:35,710
Oh, worm face.

1048
00:50:35,890 --> 00:50:36,630
Yeah, he is.

1049
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:37,170
Okay.

1050
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:37,930
And he has...

1051
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:38,990
Okay, that's not fair.

1052
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:39,830
He has friends.

1053
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:41,290
That's not fair at all.

1054
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:42,330
Oh, and he's poison.

1055
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:43,450
Oh, wait.

1056
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:44,090
And he's weak.

1057
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:44,770
Oh, wait.

1058
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:45,910
I got this, guys.

1059
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:47,590
I got this.

1060
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:50,690
He's weak as fuck.

1061
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:53,910
Okay, that's not what I meant to do.

1062
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:54,930
I got this.

1063
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:56,730
Look at him slowly walking up to me.

1064
00:50:56,830 --> 00:50:58,050
Like, what is he gonna do?

1065
00:50:58,450 --> 00:50:59,510
Look at that.

1066
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:01,010
Oh!

1067
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:07,130
Okay.

1068
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:11,210
Okay.

1069
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:12,170
Okay.

1070
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:12,910
I...

1071
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:13,670
Now I know.

1072
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:14,890
Now I...

1073
00:51:14,890 --> 00:51:15,610
Okay.

1074
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:16,430
Okay.

1075
00:51:16,590 --> 00:51:16,790
Okay.

1076
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:20,170
Okay.

1077
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:20,790
I know now.

1078
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:21,410
Alright.

1079
00:51:22,310 --> 00:51:24,680
Now that I know what he can do.

1080
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:25,610
It's...

1081
00:51:25,610 --> 00:51:26,510
It's over.

1082
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:28,210
I know now, guys.

1083
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:29,930
I know what he can do.

1084
00:51:31,570 --> 00:51:32,090
Okay.

1085
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:32,810
Guys.

1086
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:34,190
I know what he can do.

1087
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:35,090
So, like...

1088
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:36,190
Oh, my God.

1089
00:51:36,370 --> 00:51:47,830
Oh, my God.

1090
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:51,030
Wait, I think... I think that's a tree.

1091
00:51:51,310 --> 00:51:53,670
Oh, I think this is gonna turn me into a tree man.

1092
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:54,710
Wait.

1093
00:51:56,170 --> 00:51:58,330
Wait, there's tree men all over him.

1094
00:51:58,750 --> 00:51:59,550
Oh, no!

1095
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:00,250
No!

1096
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:01,630
I don't wanna be a tree!

1097
00:52:02,070 --> 00:52:02,530
No!

1098
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:05,690
Ah, I'm okay!

1099
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:07,330
I'm not okay.

1100
00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:14,670
Guys, I'm not okay.

1101
00:52:15,570 --> 00:52:16,710
That's insane!

1102
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:16,950
Instant!

1103
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:20,970
Why is that instant?

1104
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:23,610
Holy fuck!

1105
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:27,310
Okay, that's illegal.

1106
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,830
I am Groot.

1107
00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:37,090
Where's my fucking... Where's my... Is that it?

1108
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:38,610
Is that where I died?

1109
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:40,210
Oh, that is where I died.

1110
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:41,490
Holy shit, I died so far.

1111
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:43,750
Okay, I figured it out, though.

1112
00:52:45,510 --> 00:52:47,090
I am Groot.

1113
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:48,870
Okay.

1114
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:51,310
I figured it out.

1115
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:06,050
Um... Guys, um... Oh... Okay.

1116
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:08,130
Oh my god.

1117
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:09,830
Guys, I don't wanna fight him anymore.

1118
00:53:12,570 --> 00:53:15,610
Actually, don't... Actually, I think I'm done fighting.

1119
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:18,470
Oh, shit!

1120
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:19,490
Where did he come from?

1121
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:25,730
Okay, let me... Okay, let me... Let me get this down real quick fast.

1122
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:26,970
Let me...

1123
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:29,230
Okay, wait.

1124
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:30,350
Let me figure this out.

1125
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:31,390
Okay.

1126
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:31,830
Yes!

1127
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:32,230
Oh!

1128
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:38,780
Oh my god.

1129
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:48,220
He just... He, like, fucking just spit at me and it was over.

1130
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:51,020
Like, what was I supposed to do?

1131
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,260
Where's my... Where's my thing?

1132
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:57,340
Okay, there it is.

1133
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:00,220
Alright, let me grab my... Okay, we're leaving.

1134
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:04,020
Okay, I realized that he's not weak, guys.

1135
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:09,960
Alright, now that I know that that was a mistake, I go now.

1136
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:18,180
How can message appraisal save me?

1137
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:21,320
Okay, we'll go this way.

1138
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,480
We'll go this way now.

1139
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:27,360
Alright, here we go.

1140
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:31,520
How will this message appraisal save me?

1141
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:36,300
How can it save me from instant death?

1142
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:39,180
Blackfire, thank you for the five gifted chips.

1143
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,120
Thank you, thank you.

1144
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:41,200
Holy shit.

1145
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:42,360
Okay, I just need you to know...

1146
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:44,560
Um...

1147
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,020
Oh my god.

1148
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:50,380
I'm at 80% CP right now.

1149
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:52,400
Okay.

1150
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,740
We'll follow the road.

1151
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,220
If only I had a gun, guys.

1152
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:57,660
If only I had my fighter jet.

1153
00:55:01,930 --> 00:55:02,410
Alright.

1154
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:05,890
My only issue is that, you know I'm mad.

1155
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:07,370
I'm gonna beat you guys up.

1156
00:55:07,450 --> 00:55:07,930
I'm mad.

1157
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:09,810
That's fucking right.

1158
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:11,190
I'm mad.

1159
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:13,670
Okay.

1160
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:15,310
Get outta here!

1161
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:16,430
That's right!

1162
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:19,010
I let my anger out on the little guys.

1163
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:20,330
But...

1164
00:55:20,330 --> 00:55:22,290
You were the Canadian one, Doki.

1165
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:25,670
You were meant to chop down the trees, not join them.

1166
00:55:26,110 --> 00:55:27,650
Danny, thank you for the super chat.

1167
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:28,850
Thank you, thank you.

1168
00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:29,910
Oh shit.

1169
00:55:32,210 --> 00:55:33,210
Okay, that's fine.

1170
00:55:34,450 --> 00:55:35,270
And then...

1171
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:35,630
Whoops.

1172
00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:36,370
That's fine.

1173
00:55:36,370 --> 00:55:37,290
I don't care about these jets.

1174
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:38,150
Oh.

1175
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:39,990
That's fucking right.

1176
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:41,350
You think I care?

1177
00:55:41,590 --> 00:55:43,170
I have nine pots.

1178
00:55:43,810 --> 00:55:44,450
Yeah, you can...

1179
00:55:44,450 --> 00:55:44,910
Come on!

1180
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:45,910
Hit me again!

1181
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:46,610
I like it!

1182
00:55:48,770 --> 00:55:50,190
Yeah, you think I care?

1183
00:55:50,290 --> 00:55:52,090
That's right, you're gonna die anyway.

1184
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:53,350
There we go.

1185
00:55:53,730 --> 00:55:54,770
I can brute force that.

1186
00:55:58,390 --> 00:55:59,550
That's fucking right.

1187
00:55:59,770 --> 00:56:00,610
Brute force time.

1188
00:56:00,970 --> 00:56:01,370
Let's go.

1189
00:56:03,070 --> 00:56:03,550
Alright.

1190
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:04,650
We go...

1191
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:05,690
It should be like...

1192
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:06,390
This way?

1193
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:07,870
And then up this rock?

1194
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:09,050
The fuck?

1195
00:56:09,410 --> 00:56:10,650
Why do I get up there?

1196
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:14,090
How do I get up there?

1197
00:56:17,170 --> 00:56:18,390
Do I go this way?

1198
00:56:18,570 --> 00:56:19,870
Do I go to that giant bridge?

1199
00:56:21,270 --> 00:56:21,970
Or do I...

1200
00:56:21,970 --> 00:56:23,210
Oh, I can climb up these rocks.

1201
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:29,170
Wait, but I can go up these rocks, though.

1202
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:32,890
Does this work?

1203
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:40,690
Okay, this does not work.

1204
00:56:43,530 --> 00:56:43,970
JK.

1205
00:56:45,330 --> 00:56:46,650
This doesn't work, guys.

1206
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:48,410
God, I'm so lost.

1207
00:56:49,470 --> 00:56:50,770
Guys, it's not the...

1208
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:51,310
Oh wait, look.

1209
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:51,670
NPC.

1210
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:52,190
Nice.

1211
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:52,710
Free stuff.

1212
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:54,630
Give me...

1213
00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:55,830
Give me free stuff first, though.

1214
00:56:56,990 --> 00:56:57,310
Hello.

1215
00:56:58,730 --> 00:56:59,390
Oh, Earth Tree.

1216
00:56:59,530 --> 00:57:00,190
Great Earth Tree.

1217
00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:01,370
The Golden Order itself.

1218
00:57:01,610 --> 00:57:03,090
Unwavering stretch to the sky.

1219
00:57:03,530 --> 00:57:05,670
Confere your guidance to our Elden Lord.

1220
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:08,130
You put this worry world to rights.

1221
00:57:08,430 --> 00:57:10,570
Okay, where's my fucking free shit, buddy?

1222
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:13,610
I'm not your buddy, guy.

1223
00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:17,570
Alright.

1224
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:20,110
Get out of here.

1225
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:21,350
Give me your shit.

1226
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:23,990
Oh, just cause you have a big arrow.

1227
00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:24,820
You think I'm scared?

1228
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:28,710
AHHHHH!

1229
00:57:29,390 --> 00:57:30,290
Guys, can you...

1230
00:57:30,290 --> 00:57:31,650
Can you get your big arrow back?

1231
00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:37,370
Oh, shit.

1232
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:38,850
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1233
00:57:39,070 --> 00:57:39,390
I...

1234
00:57:39,390 --> 00:57:40,890
Your big arrow was so cool.

1235
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:43,230
It was so cool, though.

1236
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:47,310
I'm sorry.

1237
00:57:47,310 --> 00:57:47,590
It...

1238
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:48,270
It was so cool.

1239
00:57:48,370 --> 00:57:48,930
I'm sorry.

1240
00:57:49,770 --> 00:57:50,070
It...

1241
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:52,230
I...

1242
00:57:52,230 --> 00:57:52,890
AHH!

1243
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:56,810
It was so cool.

1244
00:57:57,870 --> 00:57:59,230
I peed it.

1245
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:02,930
Carilla's strengths.

1246
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:04,990
It's okay.

1247
00:58:05,230 --> 00:58:05,550
I can't...

1248
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:05,610
I can't...

1249
00:58:05,610 --> 00:58:06,350
I got my stuff.

1250
00:58:06,670 --> 00:58:07,690
City ahead.

1251
00:58:07,910 --> 00:58:08,430
Oh, this way.

1252
00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:09,450
Oh!

1253
00:58:09,670 --> 00:58:10,150
This way.

1254
00:58:10,390 --> 00:58:10,570
Oh!

1255
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:10,790
Okay.

1256
00:58:14,570 --> 00:58:16,870
You do this to yourself.

1257
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:21,450
I don't know.

1258
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:24,630
I thought he was gonna still have the giant ass arrows.

1259
00:58:25,450 --> 00:58:27,310
I'd be like, fucking stupid.

1260
00:58:27,590 --> 00:58:27,950
What are you gonna do?

1261
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:28,950
Oh, shit!

1262
00:58:31,790 --> 00:58:33,870
Oh my god, I didn't see the crossbowers.

1263
00:58:34,430 --> 00:58:36,230
Yeah, I'm fucking getting torn in here.

1264
00:58:36,370 --> 00:58:37,650
I'm getting my horse in here.

1265
00:58:38,290 --> 00:58:39,270
Wait, Grace, am I right?

1266
00:58:39,530 --> 00:58:40,630
Oh, shit, I like that.

1267
00:58:40,790 --> 00:58:42,150
I like Grace.

1268
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,740
Where is it?

1269
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:51,120
Where the fuck is the Grace?

1270
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:54,860
Where the fuck is the goddamn Grace?

1271
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:03,340
Oh my god, he said right!

1272
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,640
Oh, sorry, you're right.

1273
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,780
Sorry, you're right, not my right.

1274
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:16,320
Alright, let me go the other right.

1275
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:21,500
Alright, let's go to find the Grace again.

1276
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:26,240
They have enough for a level up, I'm pretty sure.

1277
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:28,400
Yeah?

1278
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:33,520
Where the fuck is the Grace?

1279
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,240
Where is it?

1280
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:41,200
No!

1281
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:42,620
That's another!

1282
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:45,580
Oh my god, near the night you just killed.

1283
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:47,880
Oh my god, which one?

1284
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:53,640
Oh, the giant arrow man.

1285
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:55,560
Okay, okay, we're figuring it out.

1286
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:00,380
Okay.

1287
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:00,820
Okay.

1288
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:02,440
Okay, so, there is him.

1289
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:05,060
Alright, which right is it?

1290
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:06,840
Oh, there it is!

1291
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:08,500
Oh my god, it was back here.

1292
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:08,860
Sorry.

1293
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,160
Apparently, sorry.

1294
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:13,680
You got- you must- might have- your stream might be a little slow.

1295
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:17,900
Alright.

1296
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:18,280
Alright.

1297
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:19,680
Now, we got it.

1298
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:20,260
Okay.

1299
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:22,160
Let's sit down.

1300
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:25,540
Do I have enough?

1301
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,080
Okay, how much do I need?

1302
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:28,400
26.

1303
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:30,660
Uh...

1304
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:32,700
Okay, we could farm that guy.

1305
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:35,320
Actually, let's see our inventory.

1306
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:36,580
Real quick.

1307
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:37,620
Just to be sure.

1308
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:42,620
800, 2,000... Okay, 2.2...

1309
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:44,640
No, we don't have enough.

1310
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:45,900
I gotta kill him again.

1311
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:48,260
No, I don't have enough runes.

1312
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:50,020
I might have to level up before I go up there.

1313
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:51,000
Just in case.

1314
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:54,920
Just in case something bad happens to me.

1315
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:56,680
Which might be...

1316
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:59,000
Which happens quite often.

1317
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:05,080
I also don't know how much damage he does, to be fair.

1318
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,380
Oh shit, I forgot again!

1319
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:14,100
I forgot he does that.

1320
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:16,180
I forgot...

1321
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:18,280
I forgot he does that.

1322
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:19,180
Whoop!

1323
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:22,400
Okay, that's fine.

1324
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:24,260
Oh, that's not fine.

1325
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:25,900
That's not fine.

1326
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:26,640
Let me...

1327
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,140
Get down from here.

1328
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:29,140
Oh, okay.

1329
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:32,900
Oh no!

1330
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:33,680
Oh no!

1331
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:35,740
Okay.

1332
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:38,540
It's fine.

1333
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:40,540
Oh, it's not fine.

1334
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:42,240
It's not fine.

1335
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:44,940
Oh my god!

1336
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:46,420
It's okay.

1337
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:49,960
Nice, okay.

1338
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:52,020
Oh, he's just one hit.

1339
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,500
I got this.

1340
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:54,280
There we go.

1341
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:56,500
Oh, he gives me 900!

1342
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:57,860
Okay, that's 1k.

1343
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:58,860
Okay, that's fine.

1344
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:01,940
Uh, and then I just need to do like...

1345
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:04,160
23...

1346
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:04,640
Maybe?

1347
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:09,580
Okay, if I get to 23, I should have enough.

1348
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:10,560
Or 20...

1349
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,240
2, 3...

1350
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:13,040
Actually, no.

1351
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:14,120
I should have enough right now.

1352
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:15,940
I'll just use up all my runes.

1353
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:16,440
Fuck it.

1354
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:17,240
Oh wait, no!

1355
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:18,080
I have enough right now!

1356
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:18,580
Alright.

1357
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:20,740
Nice, I can't count, guys.

1358
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:22,240
I didn't realize I had 2.

1359
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,880
Alright, now I have enough.

1360
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:28,020
Uh...

1361
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:29,360
Alright.

1362
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:30,920
Okay, I don't have enough.

1363
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:31,300
Okay.

1364
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:36,480
Now!

1365
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:39,000
I have enough.

1366
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:41,940
Oh fuck, I still don't have enough.

1367
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:42,360
Okay.

1368
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:44,960
I should have used this one.

1369
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:47,000
Okay, now I have enough.

1370
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:48,260
For now.

1371
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:48,700
Okay.

1372
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:49,840
Alright, what do we get?

1373
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,240
What do we get, guys?

1374
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:55,360
Bigger.

1375
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:56,200
Endurance.

1376
01:02:56,580 --> 01:02:56,780
Strength.

1377
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:57,820
Okay, we're not doing strength.

1378
01:02:58,760 --> 01:02:59,280
Dexterity.

1379
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:00,620
Arcane.

1380
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:02,640
One day.

1381
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:18,940
The problem with trying to give Doki directions of any kind is that she never stops moving for more than one second.

1382
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:19,840
Gladstone.

1383
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:20,860
Thank you for the super chat.

1384
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:22,000
Thank you.

1385
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:23,000
Dexterity?

1386
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:24,260
Okay, we'll do Dexterity.

1387
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:28,870
Alright.

1388
01:03:30,070 --> 01:03:31,670
Okay, now we can leave.

1389
01:03:32,590 --> 01:03:33,550
Alright, horse.

1390
01:03:33,890 --> 01:03:34,890
Come with me!

1391
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:37,850
We're gonna go on a little adventure.

1392
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:40,370
Weeeee!

1393
01:03:41,830 --> 01:03:43,150
I don't like today.

1394
01:03:43,430 --> 01:03:46,050
My CPU is like going fucking crazy today.

1395
01:03:48,390 --> 01:03:49,010
Alright.

1396
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:50,130
Up we go.

1397
01:03:51,710 --> 01:03:52,130
Yay!

1398
01:03:53,710 --> 01:03:55,670
Okay, we can ride through all of this.

1399
01:03:58,150 --> 01:03:59,170
It's fine.

1400
01:03:59,530 --> 01:03:59,690
It's fine.

1401
01:03:59,690 --> 01:04:00,750
There should be nothing here anyway.

1402
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:03,010
Wait, unless...

1403
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:03,930
Anything here?

1404
01:04:04,390 --> 01:04:06,170
No, there shouldn't be anything here.

1405
01:04:09,170 --> 01:04:09,850
Alright.

1406
01:04:10,230 --> 01:04:10,930
It's fine.

1407
01:04:11,870 --> 01:04:14,010
I can just ride through all of this.

1408
01:04:14,690 --> 01:04:15,370
Weeeee!

1409
01:04:18,550 --> 01:04:19,230
Weeeee!

1410
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:19,590
Oh, look.

1411
01:04:19,670 --> 01:04:21,510
There's a little buddy of mine here.

1412
01:04:22,930 --> 01:04:23,450
Weeeee!

1413
01:04:24,510 --> 01:04:26,730
Look at these other big ass horses.

1414
01:04:27,210 --> 01:04:27,370
Ha!

1415
01:04:27,710 --> 01:04:28,610
But I don't...

1416
01:04:28,610 --> 01:04:28,870
Ha!

1417
01:04:29,210 --> 01:04:29,590
Ha!

1418
01:04:30,050 --> 01:04:30,190
Ha!

1419
01:04:32,830 --> 01:04:33,350
Ha!

1420
01:04:33,350 --> 01:04:33,410
Ha!

1421
01:04:34,190 --> 01:04:34,290
Ha!

1422
01:04:34,290 --> 01:04:34,370
There.

1423
01:04:34,790 --> 01:04:35,150
Ha!

1424
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:35,850
Ha!

1425
01:04:35,870 --> 01:04:36,030
Ha!

1426
01:04:36,030 --> 01:04:36,150
Ha!

1427
01:04:37,070 --> 01:04:37,790
Ha!

1428
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:38,850
I...

1429
01:04:38,850 --> 01:04:39,270
I...

1430
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:42,030
Did not expect another big ass horse here.

1431
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:43,210
But that's okay.

1432
01:04:43,730 --> 01:04:44,890
I got...

1433
01:04:44,890 --> 01:04:45,810
Botee!

1434
01:04:46,410 --> 01:04:47,010
Hehehe!

1435
01:04:47,590 --> 01:04:48,050
Yay!

1436
01:04:49,470 --> 01:04:50,810
Can I like...

1437
01:04:51,350 --> 01:04:52,250
Go home?

1438
01:04:53,330 --> 01:04:54,870
Oh, they got tired.

1439
01:04:55,210 --> 01:04:55,870
That's cool.

1440
01:04:56,870 --> 01:04:57,090
Ha!

1441
01:04:57,090 --> 01:04:58,050
They got...

1442
01:04:58,050 --> 01:04:59,630
They got tired, guys.

1443
01:04:59,730 --> 01:05:00,210
We're fine.

1444
01:05:00,810 --> 01:05:01,850
They got sleepy.

1445
01:05:02,850 --> 01:05:04,330
Oh, I still don't have enough?

1446
01:05:04,830 --> 01:05:06,290
How much do you need for flask?

1447
01:05:07,210 --> 01:05:08,370
Well, I need three.

1448
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:09,050
I only have two.

1449
01:05:09,430 --> 01:05:09,570
Okay.

1450
01:05:11,230 --> 01:05:11,750
Alright.

1451
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:14,430
Okay, I'm gonna grab this item.

1452
01:05:14,630 --> 01:05:15,610
And then I...

1453
01:05:15,610 --> 01:05:16,530
I'll go challenge them.

1454
01:05:17,370 --> 01:05:17,810
Alright.

1455
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:18,790
I'm ready.

1456
01:05:19,490 --> 01:05:19,690
Ha!

1457
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:21,750
They think they can win?

1458
01:05:21,950 --> 01:05:23,330
Just cuz there's two of them?

1459
01:05:23,910 --> 01:05:24,410
Ha ha!

1460
01:05:29,350 --> 01:05:29,870
Alright.

1461
01:05:30,610 --> 01:05:31,810
That's what they think.

1462
01:05:34,370 --> 01:05:35,270
There we go.

1463
01:05:35,410 --> 01:05:36,250
We do it here.

1464
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:37,850
And then...

1465
01:05:39,230 --> 01:05:39,790
Alright.

1466
01:05:40,310 --> 01:05:41,090
Alright, guys.

1467
01:05:41,290 --> 01:05:41,830
I need...

1468
01:05:41,830 --> 01:05:43,690
Because there's two of them...

1469
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:44,090
Uh...

1470
01:05:44,090 --> 01:05:44,870
Ha ha ha!

1471
01:05:48,490 --> 01:05:51,950
Because there's two of them, we need as much help as I can get.

1472
01:05:54,930 --> 01:05:55,490
Alright.

1473
01:05:56,370 --> 01:05:56,930
Ah...

1474
01:05:57,630 --> 01:05:59,510
We're min-maxing right here.

1475
01:05:59,930 --> 01:06:00,650
Ha ha ha ha!

1476
01:06:01,810 --> 01:06:02,810
Alright, I'm ready.

1477
01:06:02,810 --> 01:06:04,950
I'm fucking ready, guys.

1478
01:06:05,290 --> 01:06:07,070
Get in position, dragoons!

1479
01:06:07,470 --> 01:06:08,890
Get in position!

1480
01:06:09,370 --> 01:06:09,970
We're ready!

1481
01:06:12,370 --> 01:06:14,370
We're so ready now.

1482
01:06:14,810 --> 01:06:15,630
That's fucking right.

1483
01:06:15,670 --> 01:06:16,990
I can take them now.

1484
01:06:17,290 --> 01:06:18,870
I'm not scared.

1485
01:06:24,510 --> 01:06:26,130
That's fucking right.

1486
01:06:26,790 --> 01:06:27,370
That's right.

1487
01:06:27,470 --> 01:06:28,370
What you gonna do now?

1488
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:31,510
You think you can win?

1489
01:06:32,270 --> 01:06:34,650
I have... I have jellyfish.

1490
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:36,650
Wait, actually, I can just aggro one guy.

1491
01:06:37,290 --> 01:06:37,510
Wait.

1492
01:06:38,810 --> 01:06:39,290
Wait.

1493
01:06:39,530 --> 01:06:40,090
Wait a minute.

1494
01:06:42,230 --> 01:06:42,830
That's it!

1495
01:06:42,850 --> 01:06:43,910
I don't need an army!

1496
01:06:44,050 --> 01:06:44,850
I have cheese!

1497
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:48,050
Let's go!

1498
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:50,950
I only have to fight one!

1499
01:06:51,770 --> 01:06:52,810
Let's actually go!

1500
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:53,510
Oh my god!

1501
01:06:53,650 --> 01:06:55,690
And this one guy is already so fucking strong.

1502
01:06:56,110 --> 01:06:56,870
Holy shit.

1503
01:06:56,950 --> 01:06:57,870
Maybe I do need cheese.

1504
01:06:57,870 --> 01:06:59,210
Oh my god.

1505
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:03,110
What is my jellyfish doing?!

1506
01:07:03,110 --> 01:07:03,610
Oh!

1507
01:07:03,830 --> 01:07:04,090
Guys!

1508
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:04,290
Guys!

1509
01:07:04,390 --> 01:07:04,590
Guys!

1510
01:07:04,590 --> 01:07:04,710
Guys!

1511
01:07:04,710 --> 01:07:04,890
Guys!

1512
01:07:04,890 --> 01:07:05,050
I'm choking!

1513
01:07:05,270 --> 01:07:05,470
I'm choking!

1514
01:07:05,910 --> 01:07:06,930
I'm choking!

1515
01:07:12,850 --> 01:07:15,350
What is my jellyfish doing?!

1516
01:07:15,350 --> 01:07:16,390
Oh my god!

1517
01:07:16,890 --> 01:07:18,510
He can't be in here.

1518
01:07:18,730 --> 01:07:19,570
I just...

1519
01:07:19,570 --> 01:07:22,530
It's... Oh my god, I just noticed.

1520
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:25,310
I just noticed he can't be in here.

1521
01:07:25,790 --> 01:07:27,210
Oh my god.

1522
01:07:30,030 --> 01:07:31,950
He can't be in here.

1523
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:34,750
Bro, but I have to fight him here!

1524
01:07:35,690 --> 01:07:36,310
Okay.

1525
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:40,250
That's it.

1526
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:41,770
I still got this.

1527
01:07:41,930 --> 01:07:43,750
Okay, I can do this without the jellyfish.

1528
01:07:43,830 --> 01:07:44,950
It's me and the dragoons.

1529
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:47,770
Dragoons is enough.

1530
01:07:49,570 --> 01:07:50,790
What's the dragoons right now?

1531
01:07:53,470 --> 01:07:55,470
Me and my dragoons!

1532
01:07:55,570 --> 01:07:56,010
Come on!

1533
01:07:57,150 --> 01:07:58,550
We can do this!

1534
01:07:59,650 --> 01:08:00,330
10v1!

1535
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:05,120
Okay.

1536
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:08,340
Holy shit.

1537
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:09,780
Guys, 10v1!

1538
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:13,820
Okay, that's fine.

1539
01:08:15,340 --> 01:08:18,580
Guys, guys, any moment now, any...

1540
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:23,920
Any moment now, guys?

1541
01:08:24,180 --> 01:08:25,220
Guys, any...

1542
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:26,540
Any moment, guys?

1543
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:27,500
Come on!

1544
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:31,500
You guys gave me that little message of praise on the goddamn tree!

1545
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,740
Any moment, guys!

1546
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:36,180
I'm ready!

1547
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:37,500
I'm so ready, guys!

1548
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:38,920
I'm right here!

1549
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:44,120
Guys, come on!

1550
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:45,640
I'm right here, guys!

1551
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:47,520
Come on!

1552
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:47,980
Whoa!

1553
01:08:50,620 --> 01:08:51,300
Oh!

1554
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:52,300
Oh, my God!

1555
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:53,560
No help.

1556
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:54,960
No help.

1557
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:56,280
Guys, come on!

1558
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:56,940
We're a team!

1559
01:08:57,460 --> 01:08:58,720
What happened to...

1560
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:00,240
I have an army!

1561
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:02,100
Remember that whole speech I had?

1562
01:09:02,940 --> 01:09:05,540
Guys, guys, what happened to my speech?

1563
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:08,340
It was so motivational and everything!

1564
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:11,720
Guys, were you not motivated?

1565
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:17,280
Oh, my God.

1566
01:09:18,380 --> 01:09:19,680
Come on, guys!

1567
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:21,920
It was so motivational!

1568
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,460
Oh, my God.

1569
01:09:26,140 --> 01:09:26,960
Just one!

1570
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:27,980
Just one!

1571
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:29,620
Just one, that's all I ask.

1572
01:09:29,980 --> 01:09:31,620
I put two messages down, please.

1573
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:32,380
I...

1574
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:35,000
Oh, no!

1575
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:36,340
Sorry, Doki.

1576
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:37,780
We're on a break right now.

1577
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:39,960
Okay.

1578
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:41,040
Okay.

1579
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:42,100
I had to shut the lock-in.

1580
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:43,100
Oh, my God.

1581
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:45,520
Finally, somebody found my messages.

1582
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:47,480
They did it!

1583
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:48,620
Oh, my God!

1584
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,080
Oh, my God!

1585
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:54,060
That's fine!

1586
01:09:54,180 --> 01:09:55,200
Me and that one dragon!

1587
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:56,640
We got this!

1588
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:00,260
Oh, no.

1589
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:01,220
Oh, no!

1590
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:03,260
I'm living by a thread.

1591
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:06,320
Oh, my God.

1592
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:10,360
Okay.

1593
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:13,980
What the fuck?

1594
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:14,520
He's just...

1595
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:14,840
No!

1596
01:10:15,260 --> 01:10:16,380
No, you can't just...

1597
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:16,800
No!

1598
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:19,390
No, no.

1599
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:21,410
No, no, no, no.

1600
01:10:21,670 --> 01:10:22,230
You...

1601
01:10:22,230 --> 01:10:22,970
I swear to God.

1602
01:10:23,170 --> 01:10:23,890
I swear...

1603
01:10:23,890 --> 01:10:25,350
I swear to God.

1604
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:26,010
I...

1605
01:10:26,010 --> 01:10:27,430
I swear to God.

1606
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:29,590
If you still have your HP...

1607
01:10:29,590 --> 01:10:29,850
I...

1608
01:10:29,850 --> 01:10:31,350
Then he just walks away!

1609
01:10:32,050 --> 01:10:33,070
You fucker.

1610
01:10:33,090 --> 01:10:34,910
You actual fucker.

1611
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:35,910
I swear to God.

1612
01:10:36,230 --> 01:10:37,510
I swear to God.

1613
01:10:37,570 --> 01:10:38,770
I'm not done with you.

1614
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:40,770
I'm not done with you.

1615
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:41,890
Oh!

1616
01:10:42,210 --> 01:10:42,730
Okay.

1617
01:10:42,790 --> 01:10:43,570
Maybe I am.

1618
01:10:43,750 --> 01:10:44,850
I'm done with you.

1619
01:10:45,030 --> 01:10:46,010
I'm done with you.

1620
01:10:46,170 --> 01:10:46,610
I'm...

1621
01:10:59,990 --> 01:11:02,250
I'm not getting my runes back.

1622
01:11:02,390 --> 01:11:03,810
I'm not going that far up.

1623
01:11:03,810 --> 01:11:04,430
All right.

1624
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:05,570
He said...

1625
01:11:06,210 --> 01:11:08,350
Come get any water away.

1626
01:11:08,710 --> 01:11:09,790
Water, water...

1627
01:11:16,910 --> 01:11:17,550
Okay.

1628
01:11:18,050 --> 01:11:18,390
I'm...

1629
01:11:18,390 --> 01:11:19,270
Maybe I'll try this guy.

1630
01:11:19,430 --> 01:11:20,330
Maybe this guy.

1631
01:11:20,590 --> 01:11:22,330
Maybe he'll be easier.

1632
01:11:22,650 --> 01:11:22,890
Okay.

1633
01:11:23,990 --> 01:11:24,390
Maybe.

1634
01:11:25,510 --> 01:11:26,770
I'll try this guy.

1635
01:11:26,930 --> 01:11:27,230
All right.

1636
01:11:27,370 --> 01:11:29,590
We'll try the right side.

1637
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:32,390
Maybe the right side will be easier.

1638
01:11:33,730 --> 01:11:35,270
He's the right horse.

1639
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:36,950
Truly the right horse.

1640
01:11:37,750 --> 01:11:39,110
Oh my god.

1641
01:11:48,150 --> 01:11:50,250
Okay, we'll go with left side.

1642
01:11:50,430 --> 01:11:53,130
Left side seems to be the easier one.

1643
01:11:56,250 --> 01:12:04,090
Alright, okay, now that we tested both the left and the right horse, I think I relate to the most to the left horse.

1644
01:12:04,090 --> 01:12:04,990
Alright.

1645
01:12:05,630 --> 01:12:07,850
Yeah, the left sounds good.

1646
01:12:08,110 --> 01:12:09,030
The left sounds good.

1647
01:12:09,210 --> 01:12:09,930
We got this.

1648
01:12:12,130 --> 01:12:13,390
Alright, here we go.

1649
01:12:14,170 --> 01:12:16,450
Bum bum bum, and he watered away.

1650
01:12:16,850 --> 01:12:17,690
Bum bum bum.

1651
01:12:18,690 --> 01:12:19,370
Alright.

1652
01:12:19,870 --> 01:12:20,510
Let's go.

1653
01:12:22,710 --> 01:12:23,390
Okay.

1654
01:12:23,910 --> 01:12:25,010
Okay, we're fine.

1655
01:12:26,350 --> 01:12:26,730
Alright.

1656
01:12:29,510 --> 01:12:30,190
Okay.

1657
01:12:30,190 --> 01:12:31,190
Okay, buddy.

1658
01:12:34,990 --> 01:12:36,030
Okay.

1659
01:12:37,050 --> 01:12:37,890
Okay, buddy.

1660
01:12:39,470 --> 01:12:40,090
Alright.

1661
01:12:44,110 --> 01:12:45,210
Jesus Christ!

1662
01:12:45,610 --> 01:12:46,870
Holy fuck!

1663
01:12:49,110 --> 01:12:51,510
I need a dodge left for that.

1664
01:12:53,330 --> 01:12:54,690
Okay, so...

1665
01:12:57,130 --> 01:12:58,730
You know, I would...

1666
01:12:58,730 --> 01:13:02,090
I would summon the jelly, but in my area...

1667
01:13:02,970 --> 01:13:04,190
There's no jelly here.

1668
01:13:04,290 --> 01:13:05,830
I can't get the jelly in here.

1669
01:13:07,710 --> 01:13:09,770
Why do I use... I'm so bad with the horse.

1670
01:13:09,790 --> 01:13:11,070
I can't fight with the horse.

1671
01:13:12,810 --> 01:13:15,010
I'm actually terrible fighting with the horse.

1672
01:13:18,790 --> 01:13:20,030
Okay, this time.

1673
01:13:25,770 --> 01:13:26,210
Woo!

1674
01:13:27,190 --> 01:13:27,630
Woo!

1675
01:13:29,150 --> 01:13:29,590
Woo!

1676
01:13:32,050 --> 01:13:32,490
Okay.

1677
01:13:34,390 --> 01:13:36,250
Yeah, I hate the horse combat in this game.

1678
01:13:36,350 --> 01:13:37,030
That's why I don't do it.

1679
01:13:37,030 --> 01:13:37,890
Oh!

1680
01:13:40,110 --> 01:13:40,590
No!

1681
01:13:41,470 --> 01:13:42,430
Holy fuck!

1682
01:13:42,730 --> 01:13:42,990
Okay.

1683
01:13:46,990 --> 01:13:47,690
Oh my god.

1684
01:13:47,830 --> 01:13:48,610
Oh my god.

1685
01:13:48,730 --> 01:13:49,470
That was awkward.

1686
01:13:49,810 --> 01:13:50,530
But that's fine.

1687
01:13:51,950 --> 01:13:53,010
I'm fine with that.

1688
01:13:57,450 --> 01:13:58,310
Holy shit.

1689
01:13:58,650 --> 01:14:00,810
Me and my dragoons, we're doing it.

1690
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:03,210
Oh fuck!

1691
01:14:03,330 --> 01:14:04,750
Okay, I did not mean to face stack that.

1692
01:14:04,790 --> 01:14:05,370
I swear to god.

1693
01:14:06,750 --> 01:14:07,810
Oh my god.

1694
01:14:07,970 --> 01:14:09,410
And I did not mean to do that either.

1695
01:14:09,970 --> 01:14:10,450
I...

1696
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:14,810
Okay, I need to remember not to go too far out.

1697
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:15,830
Okay.

1698
01:14:16,310 --> 01:14:16,750
It's fine.

1699
01:14:18,490 --> 01:14:19,530
Are you serious?

1700
01:14:20,510 --> 01:14:22,070
You're such a bitch!

1701
01:14:22,470 --> 01:14:23,890
Oh my god, you're actually such a bitch.

1702
01:14:24,290 --> 01:14:25,110
You're such a bitch.

1703
01:14:25,430 --> 01:14:26,590
You're such a bitch.

1704
01:14:27,110 --> 01:14:27,950
Holy shit.

1705
01:14:32,290 --> 01:14:33,490
Okay, we're fine.

1706
01:14:36,050 --> 01:14:36,730
Alright.

1707
01:14:37,110 --> 01:14:38,850
I still don't know his combos.

1708
01:14:42,410 --> 01:14:43,710
Is it obvious?

1709
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:44,990
Nah, right?

1710
01:14:50,350 --> 01:14:52,190
There's no way it's that obvious.

1711
01:14:55,410 --> 01:14:56,090
Ah!

1712
01:14:56,470 --> 01:14:57,490
Fucking hell!

1713
01:14:57,690 --> 01:14:58,870
What can I do?

1714
01:15:02,190 --> 01:15:02,870
Okay.

1715
01:15:02,870 --> 01:15:04,810
I know that combo at least.

1716
01:15:08,030 --> 01:15:08,510
Okay.

1717
01:15:09,030 --> 01:15:09,850
We know that one.

1718
01:15:10,070 --> 01:15:10,690
They got it.

1719
01:15:13,630 --> 01:15:14,450
Oh fuck!

1720
01:15:21,510 --> 01:15:22,790
I don't know that one, guys.

1721
01:15:22,970 --> 01:15:23,690
I don't know that one.

1722
01:15:25,910 --> 01:15:26,870
Oh my god.

1723
01:15:29,210 --> 01:15:29,830
It's okay.

1724
01:15:30,410 --> 01:15:30,770
We're fine.

1725
01:15:33,810 --> 01:15:35,970
It's okay.

1726
01:15:35,970 --> 01:15:36,070
Oh my god.

1727
01:15:36,070 --> 01:15:36,590
Holy shit.

1728
01:15:37,350 --> 01:15:37,810
Oh!

1729
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:40,330
Oh my god.

1730
01:15:40,590 --> 01:15:41,810
I'm not okay.

1731
01:15:42,450 --> 01:15:43,930
I'm not okay.

1732
01:15:44,430 --> 01:15:45,230
Oh!

1733
01:15:47,470 --> 01:15:48,590
Oh my.

1734
01:15:50,310 --> 01:15:50,850
Okay.

1735
01:15:50,850 --> 01:15:51,750
Okay, that's fine.

1736
01:15:52,870 --> 01:15:54,210
Oh, that's not fine!

1737
01:15:57,710 --> 01:15:58,690
Oh god, okay.

1738
01:15:59,390 --> 01:15:59,790
It's fine.

1739
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:04,270
Please!

1740
01:16:05,130 --> 01:16:06,850
I will reinforce this, I swear!

1741
01:16:11,990 --> 01:16:12,910
We got it.

1742
01:16:14,230 --> 01:16:14,670
Okay.

1743
01:16:15,490 --> 01:16:16,610
Alright, one down.

1744
01:16:16,910 --> 01:16:17,790
Okay, I'm gonna go back.

1745
01:16:18,290 --> 01:16:20,990
Wait, what?

1746
01:16:21,830 --> 01:16:23,490
I don't want to get anything out of that.

1747
01:16:23,670 --> 01:16:24,730
Do I have to kill two of them?

1748
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:27,030
Wait, I don't get runes?!

1749
01:16:27,030 --> 01:16:29,990
I... Okay.

1750
01:16:31,670 --> 01:16:39,110
Wait, if I go recover... Guys, if I go back, does he respawn?

1751
01:16:39,690 --> 01:16:42,710
Oh my god, he fucking... Oh my god.

1752
01:16:43,050 --> 01:16:45,690
He... Oh my god.

1753
01:16:45,690 --> 01:16:47,510
He respawns, doesn't he?

1754
01:16:48,110 --> 01:16:50,090
Where did he go?!

1755
01:16:50,090 --> 01:16:52,930
Where did he go?!

1756
01:16:55,750 --> 01:16:57,950
Where... Where did the other one go?!

1757
01:16:57,950 --> 01:16:58,810
Oh my god, he's down there!

1758
01:16:59,010 --> 01:17:04,150
Okay, I was gonna be like... Where did... Where did the other one go?!

1759
01:17:04,150 --> 01:17:06,430
He just walked down the stairs!

1760
01:17:06,550 --> 01:17:08,030
Oh my god, this fucker.

1761
01:17:08,730 --> 01:17:18,870
Oh... Okay... Okay... Okay... Can I backstab the horse?

1762
01:17:19,110 --> 01:17:20,230
We'll try to find out.

1763
01:17:23,350 --> 01:17:34,930
I don't... You cannot backstab the horse... I don't know... I just thought maybe... You know... It was a good effort.

1764
01:17:39,310 --> 01:17:43,150
It would've been pretty funny if I could backstab the horse, guys.

1765
01:17:45,570 --> 01:17:47,410
It was worth trying.

1766
01:17:47,990 --> 01:17:49,350
Holy shit!

1767
01:17:49,810 --> 01:17:51,330
My poor jellyfish!

1768
01:17:51,730 --> 01:17:53,310
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum!

1769
01:17:53,310 --> 01:17:53,890
My poor me!

1770
01:17:54,190 --> 01:17:54,770
Poor me!

1771
01:17:54,930 --> 01:17:55,250
Poor me!

1772
01:17:55,250 --> 01:17:55,290
Poor me!

1773
01:17:55,790 --> 01:17:56,230
Poor me!

1774
01:17:58,010 --> 01:18:00,370
Okay... Bro, my jellyfish is not okay.

1775
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:06,560
Oh my god, he's not okay, guys.

1776
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:08,360
He's like, literally one hit.

1777
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:13,560
Okay... Jesus Christ!

1778
01:18:14,660 --> 01:18:16,720
Please, at least poison him before you die.

1779
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:17,980
That's all I want, buddy.

1780
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,320
Watch him die right here.

1781
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:28,020
Oh my god, he did his best.

1782
01:18:28,820 --> 01:18:31,480
Oh, I'm gonna get back here a little bit.

1783
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:33,320
Are you serious?

1784
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:35,320
I thought he... Are you serious?!

1785
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:37,520
I thought... Okay, I thought he was gonna get towards me.

1786
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:38,380
I don't know.

1787
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:43,920
I don't... Oh my god.

1788
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:47,120
Oh...

1789
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:48,120
You know, I'll take that.

1790
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:50,280
Maybe he'll bleed, too.

1791
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:51,040
I don't know.

1792
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:53,840
Okay.

1793
01:18:55,340 --> 01:18:55,920
That's fine.

1794
01:18:56,940 --> 01:18:57,700
Oh, fuck!

1795
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:58,460
That's not fine.

1796
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:00,820
Oh my god.

1797
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:02,860
Ah!

1798
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:03,280
Fuck!

1799
01:19:03,460 --> 01:19:03,600
Okay.

1800
01:19:04,020 --> 01:19:05,120
I thought I was gonna die there.

1801
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:05,920
For that.

1802
01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:09,600
Oh, ho.

1803
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:11,240
Bum, bum, bum.

1804
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:13,560
Okay.

1805
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:17,000
I'll be full HP just in case, because I don't trust myself.

1806
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,060
I really, really do not trust myself.

1807
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:25,680
It's... It's not a good day to be Doki right now.

1808
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:29,100
Oh, fuck!

1809
01:19:29,260 --> 01:19:30,240
Okay, I... FUCK!

1810
01:19:30,540 --> 01:19:31,480
Not that combo!

1811
01:19:34,350 --> 01:19:35,150
Oh, no.

1812
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:36,430
I have one blast left.

1813
01:19:37,270 --> 01:19:37,490
Woo!

1814
01:19:40,990 --> 01:19:42,090
I miss her.

1815
01:19:47,270 --> 01:19:48,190
Oh, shit!

1816
01:19:49,610 --> 01:19:50,210
Okay.

1817
01:19:55,430 --> 01:19:56,030
Okay.

1818
01:19:57,230 --> 01:19:57,670
Okay.

1819
01:19:59,910 --> 01:20:00,350
Okay.

1820
01:20:00,350 --> 01:20:01,770
Okay, we got that combo off.

1821
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:09,050
Oh, not combo, but... You know, at least... Guys, I need... Guys, Doki, thank you.

1822
01:20:09,370 --> 01:20:09,810
Guys!

1823
01:20:12,030 --> 01:20:12,990
Ah, thank god!

1824
01:20:13,310 --> 01:20:13,550
Oh!

1825
01:20:14,470 --> 01:20:14,830
Whoa!

1826
01:20:15,530 --> 01:20:17,870
I'll use my last blast just in case, because I don't trust myself.

1827
01:20:18,250 --> 01:20:21,630
I... Holy shit!

1828
01:20:23,530 --> 01:20:24,290
Oh my god.

1829
01:20:24,290 --> 01:20:24,390
Okay.

1830
01:20:24,390 --> 01:20:24,550
Okay!

1831
01:20:24,550 --> 01:20:24,550
No!

1832
01:20:24,550 --> 01:20:24,550
Okay.

1833
01:20:24,550 --> 01:20:24,550
Okay.

1834
01:20:24,550 --> 01:20:24,550
Okay.

1835
01:20:26,650 --> 01:20:27,450
Okay.

1836
01:20:30,470 --> 01:20:31,210
Okay.

1837
01:20:31,210 --> 01:20:31,730
Oh, shit!

1838
01:20:32,090 --> 01:20:32,630
No!

1839
01:20:32,790 --> 01:20:32,990
No!

1840
01:20:33,230 --> 01:20:33,230
No!

1841
01:20:33,230 --> 01:20:34,490
No-no-no-no-no-no!

1842
01:20:37,540 --> 01:20:38,340
No!

1843
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:39,240
NI-no!

1844
01:20:40,660 --> 01:20:41,460
No!

1845
01:20:41,460 --> 01:20:44,910
Oh my god.

1846
01:20:45,410 --> 01:20:48,450
No, he comes back and he comes back.

1847
01:20:49,130 --> 01:20:49,930
Ah!

1848
01:20:50,290 --> 01:20:51,650
He even rolled!

1849
01:20:52,330 --> 01:20:53,390
I rolled!

1850
01:20:53,790 --> 01:20:55,750
But I missed-time the rolled!

1851
01:20:56,770 --> 01:20:57,030
Oh!

1852
01:20:58,390 --> 01:21:00,170
I give this that close.

1853
01:21:00,170 --> 01:21:02,390
Oh, oh my god.

1854
01:21:03,730 --> 01:21:06,310
Oh, I rolled too.

1855
01:21:06,730 --> 01:21:07,630
No, he's back.

1856
01:21:08,750 --> 01:21:10,350
Okay, he's back.

1857
01:21:14,230 --> 01:21:17,270
Okay, we... we get back here.

1858
01:21:17,490 --> 01:21:19,110
We're in our little house.

1859
01:21:20,450 --> 01:21:22,890
Okay, now we're in our little house.

1860
01:21:23,070 --> 01:21:24,450
Okay, okay.

1861
01:21:26,370 --> 01:21:27,610
Are you serious?

1862
01:21:27,870 --> 01:21:28,770
Oh my god.

1863
01:21:29,650 --> 01:21:34,510
And this... and this little guy saying thank you for the super chat.

1864
01:21:36,710 --> 01:21:40,630
I don't know if I should use my R... my bleed or both my poison.

1865
01:21:41,070 --> 01:21:41,870
I don't know.

1866
01:21:43,110 --> 01:21:46,890
I don't know which one would work because I feel like he's not getting poisoned at all.

1867
01:21:48,110 --> 01:21:49,110
Dude, that's the thing.

1868
01:21:53,470 --> 01:21:54,210
Do a bleed?

1869
01:21:54,450 --> 01:21:55,390
You should just use your bleed?

1870
01:21:55,530 --> 01:21:56,530
Okay, I'll just use my bleed.

1871
01:21:57,350 --> 01:21:58,170
Oh, fuck.

1872
01:21:58,330 --> 01:22:00,070
I thought I had a tough time to dodge that.

1873
01:22:00,530 --> 01:22:01,790
That was my bad.

1874
01:22:02,950 --> 01:22:04,270
Okay, I'll just use my bleed then.

1875
01:22:06,870 --> 01:22:09,370
Is this attack that fucks me up the most?

1876
01:22:12,310 --> 01:22:12,790
Okay.

1877
01:22:15,110 --> 01:22:17,550
I got the bleed out once, I saw.

1878
01:22:18,370 --> 01:22:19,230
It's this one.

1879
01:22:19,310 --> 01:22:20,230
It's this attack!

1880
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:24,050
Time the fucking...

1881
01:22:24,050 --> 01:22:25,430
Oh, I always mistim that.

1882
01:22:34,030 --> 01:22:35,430
Where's power stancing?

1883
01:22:39,890 --> 01:22:41,890
Yeah, should I just two-hand the bleed then?

1884
01:22:42,770 --> 01:22:44,070
Alright, I'll two-hand the bleed.

1885
01:22:50,980 --> 01:22:52,460
Okay, the L1.

1886
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:55,420
Alright, I'll do...

1887
01:22:59,420 --> 01:23:01,880
Oh my god, I hate when they just walk forward.

1888
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,360
I hate that.

1889
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:06,400
I hate that.

1890
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:07,540
I'm like, get over here.

1891
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:11,280
Alright.

1892
01:23:13,740 --> 01:23:14,540
Oh my god.

1893
01:23:14,700 --> 01:23:15,460
Oh my god.

1894
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:18,940
Okay.

1895
01:23:23,980 --> 01:23:26,040
I wish I had my AR right now.

1896
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:32,440
I wish I had a gun.

1897
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:34,740
I wish I had a gun.

1898
01:23:34,740 --> 01:23:36,600
A gun would definitely work right now.

1899
01:23:38,420 --> 01:23:38,980
Okay.

1900
01:23:43,030 --> 01:23:44,430
Okay, we both missed.

1901
01:23:44,550 --> 01:23:45,950
It's not that embarrassing.

1902
01:23:46,810 --> 01:23:47,950
It's not...

1903
01:23:47,950 --> 01:23:50,990
It's not that embarrassing when we both missed.

1904
01:23:51,230 --> 01:23:51,950
Thank god.

1905
01:23:56,930 --> 01:23:57,610
Okay.

1906
01:24:00,690 --> 01:24:01,570
Oh my god.

1907
01:24:01,710 --> 01:24:02,510
It's always this one.

1908
01:24:02,730 --> 01:24:03,770
That fuck up on.

1909
01:24:05,210 --> 01:24:05,730
Ah!

1910
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:17,520
Jesus Christ.

1911
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:18,780
Fuck you, actually.

1912
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:19,760
Oh, nice.

1913
01:24:19,900 --> 01:24:20,480
I got the bleed.

1914
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:22,300
Yeah, see, I get bleed, but...

1915
01:24:22,300 --> 01:24:23,980
I haven't seen poison yet.

1916
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:27,220
Holy fuck.

1917
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:28,520
I can't see.

1918
01:24:28,700 --> 01:24:29,760
I can't see!

1919
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:32,380
Okay, I need...

1920
01:24:32,380 --> 01:24:33,560
Oh my god, please!

1921
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:34,980
I'm blind!

1922
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:40,510
I'm blind!

1923
01:24:40,850 --> 01:24:41,450
Okay.

1924
01:24:44,330 --> 01:24:46,050
Oh my god, he jumps too.

1925
01:24:46,610 --> 01:24:47,450
Fuckin' bitch.

1926
01:24:48,330 --> 01:24:49,350
Fuckin' what?

1927
01:24:51,250 --> 01:24:53,850
Oh my god, I need to stop face tanking that heal.

1928
01:24:55,610 --> 01:24:56,630
Are you serious?

1929
01:24:56,950 --> 01:24:58,710
Oh, I thought he was gonna do a charge!

1930
01:24:59,910 --> 01:25:02,730
I thought he was gonna do a charge!

1931
01:25:04,310 --> 01:25:06,710
Turkey, thank you for that one gifted chip.

1932
01:25:06,810 --> 01:25:07,810
Thank you, thank you.

1933
01:25:08,010 --> 01:25:08,210
Aw!

1934
01:25:08,970 --> 01:25:11,150
I thought I was gonna be a charge.

1935
01:25:11,150 --> 01:25:12,890
I was ready for a charge!

1936
01:25:18,450 --> 01:25:19,710
I got baited.

1937
01:25:20,430 --> 01:25:22,470
I got baited so hard.

1938
01:25:23,710 --> 01:25:24,930
I do more damage to...

1939
01:25:24,930 --> 01:25:25,370
I don't know.

1940
01:25:25,650 --> 01:25:26,390
I can't tell.

1941
01:25:26,390 --> 01:25:27,210
That's the thing.

1942
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:35,180
I can't tell if I do more damage.

1943
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:38,780
Two-handing or dual-wielding.

1944
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:41,880
Maybe I should try?

1945
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:44,900
I'm gonna try again.

1946
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:49,160
Okay, I'll try dual-wielding this.

1947
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:53,860
Oh my god, I hate you.

1948
01:26:00,390 --> 01:26:02,080
I hate you so much!

1949
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:03,320
I hate you.

1950
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:04,700
I hope your mother dies.

1951
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:08,620
Okay, I'm locking in.

1952
01:26:12,940 --> 01:26:13,540
Okay.

1953
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:15,700
Oh my god, stop running away!

1954
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:19,740
Jesus Christ.

1955
01:26:24,420 --> 01:26:26,060
Getting too far.

1956
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:28,160
Leave his mother out of here.

1957
01:26:34,620 --> 01:26:37,660
Why do you guys care so much about the fucking tree sentinel?

1958
01:26:38,020 --> 01:26:38,520
What?

1959
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:42,060
Okay.

1960
01:26:42,540 --> 01:26:43,080
I have this.

1961
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:44,840
To maybe help me with healing.

1962
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:47,780
On Canada today!

1963
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,700
Okay, if anything, I'm pretty sure he's not Canadian.

1964
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:58,480
Guys, I'm pretty sure the tree sentinel is not Canadian, guys.

1965
01:27:04,030 --> 01:27:04,630
Okay.

1966
01:27:04,630 --> 01:27:06,030
How do you know?

1967
01:27:06,190 --> 01:27:09,230
Because Canada doesn't exist in the Elden Ring universe!

1968
01:27:10,610 --> 01:27:12,210
There's no Canada here!

1969
01:27:14,290 --> 01:27:15,810
Oh my god, he's poisoned.

1970
01:27:16,150 --> 01:27:17,930
Oh my god, he's actually poisoned!

1971
01:27:17,930 --> 01:27:19,050
How?!

1972
01:27:25,190 --> 01:27:25,830
Okay.

1973
01:27:27,210 --> 01:27:28,170
The Mounties!

1974
01:27:30,210 --> 01:27:32,470
Oh my god, I actually poisoned him!

1975
01:27:32,570 --> 01:27:33,870
I don't know how I did it!

1976
01:27:34,270 --> 01:27:36,250
I thought poison doesn't exist here!

1977
01:27:37,310 --> 01:27:39,490
Oh wait, you guys, message to praise me.

1978
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:44,230
Oh my god, I hate it when he does that.

1979
01:27:44,950 --> 01:27:46,450
Oh wait, he's not poisoned anymore.

1980
01:27:46,530 --> 01:27:47,630
Wait, he can just get better?

1981
01:27:49,290 --> 01:27:51,050
He can just cure himself?

1982
01:27:51,950 --> 01:27:53,350
Maybe he is Canadian.

1983
01:27:53,510 --> 01:27:55,010
A Canadian healthcare, guys.

1984
01:27:55,950 --> 01:27:57,650
He got Canadian healthcare.

1985
01:28:00,830 --> 01:28:01,270
Wow!

1986
01:28:08,590 --> 01:28:09,030
Okay.

1987
01:28:10,230 --> 01:28:12,130
Oh my god, I was gonna roll that!

1988
01:28:12,590 --> 01:28:14,490
Dude, that's the thing that sucked the most.

1989
01:28:14,810 --> 01:28:16,110
I was about to roll that.

1990
01:28:17,530 --> 01:28:19,230
Oh my god, fuck!

1991
01:28:19,870 --> 01:28:22,170
Every time he jumps when I'm about to...

1992
01:28:22,170 --> 01:28:23,290
Oh, he jumps when I slash.

1993
01:28:24,130 --> 01:28:25,290
Goddamn stupid horse.

1994
01:28:30,970 --> 01:28:31,530
Alright.

1995
01:28:32,070 --> 01:28:33,210
Stupid fucking horse.

1996
01:28:38,650 --> 01:28:39,230
Okay.

1997
01:28:40,270 --> 01:28:43,510
You're right, it can't be Canada, he'd still be in the office waiting.

1998
01:28:44,210 --> 01:28:44,990
You're so right.

1999
01:28:47,570 --> 01:28:48,150
Alright.

2000
01:28:50,890 --> 01:28:51,890
Here we go.

2001
01:28:52,270 --> 01:28:53,690
Here we go again.

2002
01:28:54,330 --> 01:28:56,030
Here we go again.

2003
01:28:58,030 --> 01:29:00,270
It's a stupid horse and he knows it.

2004
01:29:05,290 --> 01:29:06,550
That's fucking right.

2005
01:29:06,850 --> 01:29:07,810
I did that.

2006
01:29:13,910 --> 01:29:18,670
Oh my god, I can actually have time to use my stance too.

2007
01:29:18,670 --> 01:29:19,830
That's actually crazy.

2008
01:29:20,870 --> 01:29:22,390
That's actually...

2009
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:23,030
Actually...

2010
01:29:23,670 --> 01:29:26,230
Oh my god, and he's actually poisoned.

2011
01:29:26,570 --> 01:29:27,270
Hold the...

2012
01:29:27,270 --> 01:29:27,570
Oh!

2013
01:29:27,970 --> 01:29:28,390
Fuck!

2014
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:31,640
Okay.

2015
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:33,200
That's right!

2016
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:34,420
Double poison!

2017
01:29:38,550 --> 01:29:38,970
Okay.

2018
01:29:41,850 --> 01:29:43,090
Are you serious?

2019
01:29:43,390 --> 01:29:44,190
Are you...

2020
01:29:44,190 --> 01:29:45,430
Okay, that was bullshit.

2021
01:29:46,310 --> 01:29:47,850
That was actually bullshit.

2022
01:29:50,750 --> 01:29:52,090
Oh my god, fuck.

2023
01:29:56,190 --> 01:29:57,390
Ho ho ho ho ho!

2024
01:29:57,830 --> 01:29:58,570
Ho ho!

2025
01:29:59,390 --> 01:30:01,810
Yeah, go after my jellyfish, stupid.

2026
01:30:03,670 --> 01:30:05,650
Okay, I don't have stances left.

2027
01:30:09,470 --> 01:30:09,790
Okay.

2028
01:30:10,530 --> 01:30:11,230
Goddamn it.

2029
01:30:11,230 --> 01:30:13,310
Oh my god, I'm right here!

2030
01:30:13,770 --> 01:30:14,270
Wait!

2031
01:30:15,470 --> 01:30:16,470
Jesus Christ.

2032
01:30:19,090 --> 01:30:19,890
Oh, fuck!

2033
01:30:20,070 --> 01:30:20,230
Okay.

2034
01:30:21,990 --> 01:30:22,490
Okay.

2035
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:27,300
Okay, it's fine.

2036
01:30:31,990 --> 01:30:32,490
What?!

2037
01:30:37,070 --> 01:30:41,150
Oh, that was close.

2038
01:30:41,550 --> 01:30:42,330
Oh, that was close.

2039
01:30:42,570 --> 01:30:42,810
Oh, that was close.

2040
01:30:42,810 --> 01:30:43,590
Holy shit, that was close.

2041
01:30:47,250 --> 01:30:47,730
Oh!

2042
01:30:48,530 --> 01:30:49,590
Guys, I think I'm fucked.

2043
01:30:50,250 --> 01:30:51,370
I'm gonna choke right here.

2044
01:30:51,610 --> 01:30:52,090
Watch this.

2045
01:30:53,210 --> 01:30:53,650
Oh!

2046
01:30:56,590 --> 01:30:58,410
Okay, maybe he'll slowly die of poison.

2047
01:31:02,550 --> 01:31:03,950
Guys, I'm not risking it.

2048
01:31:03,950 --> 01:31:04,850
I'll just...

2049
01:31:04,850 --> 01:31:05,670
I can't wait.

2050
01:31:06,210 --> 01:31:07,410
I can't wait.

2051
01:31:08,090 --> 01:31:09,130
I can't wait.

2052
01:31:09,430 --> 01:31:10,350
I can't wait.

2053
01:31:10,450 --> 01:31:12,030
Oh my god, I can wait.

2054
01:31:12,530 --> 01:31:13,410
Oh my god, that's right.

2055
01:31:13,570 --> 01:31:13,750
Die!

2056
01:31:14,610 --> 01:31:15,210
Yeah!

2057
01:31:16,270 --> 01:31:17,170
I can't...

2058
01:31:18,230 --> 01:31:19,310
There we go.

2059
01:31:19,890 --> 01:31:23,390
Alright, with the power of poison by my side.

2060
01:31:23,830 --> 01:31:25,010
Let's let it go.

2061
01:31:25,010 --> 01:31:25,550
Holy fuck!

2062
01:31:25,550 --> 01:31:27,350
Holy fuck!

2063
01:31:29,190 --> 01:31:30,290
We did it!

2064
01:31:30,770 --> 01:31:31,210
We did...

2065
01:31:31,550 --> 01:31:33,750
Oh, Johnny, thank you for the super chat.

2066
01:31:33,870 --> 01:31:34,690
Thank you, thank you.

2067
01:31:35,090 --> 01:31:36,530
Congrats on your victory.

2068
01:31:36,830 --> 01:31:41,410
I wonder if this is a bad time to mention there is a more powerful and dangerous variant.

2069
01:31:41,410 --> 01:31:41,950
We did it all.

2070
01:31:42,150 --> 01:31:42,870
No, I know.

2071
01:31:43,230 --> 01:31:43,910
I know.

2072
01:31:44,050 --> 01:31:44,910
I've seen Night Ring.

2073
01:31:45,010 --> 01:31:46,270
I've seen him in Night Ring.

2074
01:31:46,490 --> 01:31:46,990
Don't worry.

2075
01:31:47,270 --> 01:31:49,590
I remember him in Night Ring.

2076
01:31:50,090 --> 01:31:53,010
Oh my god, it's not even enough to level up.

2077
01:31:53,230 --> 01:31:54,570
That's the worst part.

2078
01:31:55,570 --> 01:31:56,430
Holy shit.

2079
01:31:56,970 --> 01:31:57,230
Okay.

2080
01:31:58,650 --> 01:32:00,450
Oh shit, can I actually use this?

2081
01:32:00,650 --> 01:32:01,110
Or nah?

2082
01:32:02,010 --> 01:32:02,350
Wait.

2083
01:32:02,950 --> 01:32:03,470
Is this actually...

2084
01:32:03,470 --> 01:32:04,310
Can I actually use this?

2085
01:32:04,410 --> 01:32:05,430
Or do I need to save this?

2086
01:32:09,450 --> 01:32:09,930
Yeah?

2087
01:32:10,250 --> 01:32:10,730
Okay.

2088
01:32:14,430 --> 01:32:14,990
Okay.

2089
01:32:16,070 --> 01:32:16,630
Now...

2090
01:32:17,330 --> 01:32:17,890
Alright.

2091
01:32:18,250 --> 01:32:19,230
Now I can level up.

2092
01:32:19,290 --> 01:32:19,710
Alright, guys.

2093
01:32:20,170 --> 01:32:21,030
Pick my stat.

2094
01:32:22,170 --> 01:32:22,830
Yum, yum, yum.

2095
01:32:28,380 --> 01:32:30,540
Time to pick my stat as our favorite game.

2096
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:32,820
It's our...

2097
01:32:32,820 --> 01:32:34,380
It's our favorite game.

2098
01:32:34,540 --> 01:32:35,120
Pick this.

2099
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:38,240
Oh, Dexterity the...

2100
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:39,640
Dexterity?

2101
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:40,000
Okay.

2102
01:32:41,540 --> 01:32:42,100
Alright.

2103
01:32:43,820 --> 01:32:45,400
Okay, where do we go now?

2104
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:47,800
New map has been found.

2105
01:32:47,860 --> 01:32:49,100
Oh, I guess we go straight here.

2106
01:32:49,380 --> 01:32:50,020
I guess so.

2107
01:32:50,580 --> 01:32:51,480
Where else would we go?

2108
01:32:54,760 --> 01:32:56,040
Alright, let's go straight up.

2109
01:32:56,580 --> 01:32:57,860
I don't know where else to go.

2110
01:32:58,040 --> 01:32:58,400
Honestly.

2111
01:33:01,820 --> 01:33:02,660
Assume it's here.

2112
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:03,460
I don't know why.

2113
01:33:03,660 --> 01:33:04,240
Like, it's a...

2114
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:05,100
What the...

2115
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:05,400
Okay.

2116
01:33:07,220 --> 01:33:07,940
Does he have...

2117
01:33:07,940 --> 01:33:09,060
Okay, he's not even...

2118
01:33:09,060 --> 01:33:09,720
You're not even part...

2119
01:33:09,720 --> 01:33:10,500
Oh my god.

2120
01:33:10,660 --> 01:33:11,880
Bro, you're not even part of the story.

2121
01:33:12,060 --> 01:33:12,600
Get out of here.

2122
01:33:13,980 --> 01:33:14,660
You're not...

2123
01:33:14,660 --> 01:33:16,560
Guys, he doesn't have a boss name.

2124
01:33:17,180 --> 01:33:18,740
He's not part of the boss.

2125
01:33:22,420 --> 01:33:23,220
I...

2126
01:33:24,740 --> 01:33:25,540
I...

2127
01:33:25,540 --> 01:33:25,920
You fucker.

2128
01:33:26,340 --> 01:33:27,220
I can...

2129
01:33:27,220 --> 01:33:28,640
I can run.

2130
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:33,220
Bro, you fucking idiot.

2131
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:35,120
Just summon him again.

2132
01:33:38,100 --> 01:33:39,860
Okay, we need that actually.

2133
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:42,420
Oh hey, there's a...

2134
01:33:42,420 --> 01:33:43,240
A witch lady.

2135
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:44,660
Hello there, ma'am.

2136
01:33:47,350 --> 01:33:48,230
You.

2137
01:33:49,410 --> 01:33:49,850
Please.

2138
01:33:50,490 --> 01:33:52,170
I can read them.

2139
01:33:52,610 --> 01:33:52,790
What?

2140
01:33:53,370 --> 01:33:54,930
Your fingers.

2141
01:33:55,450 --> 01:33:55,870
Please.

2142
01:33:56,410 --> 01:33:57,010
Your fingers.

2143
01:33:58,490 --> 01:33:59,850
How did you get here?

2144
01:34:00,330 --> 01:34:00,730
Okay.

2145
01:34:02,010 --> 01:34:03,890
The fingers I served.

2146
01:34:05,450 --> 01:34:06,770
Once prophesied.

2147
01:34:08,370 --> 01:34:11,570
A tarnished would one day...

2148
01:34:11,570 --> 01:34:12,110
That's me!

2149
01:34:12,110 --> 01:34:13,970
The Elden Lord.

2150
01:34:14,250 --> 01:34:15,160
And restore...

2151
01:34:15,990 --> 01:34:17,540
The Golden Order.

2152
01:34:17,890 --> 01:34:18,550
Yeah.

2153
01:34:20,670 --> 01:34:22,810
Surely you see it too.

2154
01:34:24,940 --> 01:34:26,470
She's talking about me, guys.

2155
01:34:27,450 --> 01:34:28,570
That's me.

2156
01:34:29,410 --> 01:34:30,330
The Great Tree.

2157
01:34:31,030 --> 01:34:32,280
Which begets...

2158
01:34:33,010 --> 01:34:34,430
The Pillars of Light.

2159
01:34:38,700 --> 01:34:40,740
Hasten to the foot of the tree.

2160
01:34:40,740 --> 01:34:42,850
She's spoiling the story.

2161
01:34:42,850 --> 01:34:43,050
Sorry.

2162
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:49,120
The fingers?

2163
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:52,960
Okay.

2164
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:56,260
I listened to the...

2165
01:34:56,260 --> 01:34:57,120
Two toes, man.

2166
01:34:58,280 --> 01:35:00,020
Alright, is there any grace nearby, chat?

2167
01:35:00,520 --> 01:35:01,060
At chat.

2168
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:02,060
Any grace nearby?

2169
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:07,740
I can't believe she just spoiled a plot like that for us.

2170
01:35:11,910 --> 01:35:12,470
No?

2171
01:35:12,830 --> 01:35:13,510
Up the slope?

2172
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:14,150
This one?

2173
01:35:14,310 --> 01:35:14,670
Or this?

2174
01:35:14,870 --> 01:35:15,250
The one?

2175
01:35:15,630 --> 01:35:16,570
North side?

2176
01:35:16,850 --> 01:35:17,610
Or the...

2177
01:35:17,610 --> 01:35:18,910
The east side?

2178
01:35:20,010 --> 01:35:20,570
North?

2179
01:35:22,730 --> 01:35:24,190
I don't know why I'm like...

2180
01:35:24,190 --> 01:35:25,530
Maybe I'll just lower some of the graphics.

2181
01:35:29,370 --> 01:35:29,930
Uh...

2182
01:35:29,930 --> 01:35:31,270
What do we not need?

2183
01:35:34,490 --> 01:35:34,970
What do we not need?

2184
01:35:34,970 --> 01:35:35,250
Okay, guys.

2185
01:35:35,650 --> 01:35:36,970
We're gonna lower something on the...

2186
01:35:36,970 --> 01:35:38,470
What do we not need as much?

2187
01:35:38,570 --> 01:35:39,050
Less grass?

2188
01:35:39,550 --> 01:35:39,970
Alright.

2189
01:35:40,210 --> 01:35:40,610
Oh, wait.

2190
01:35:40,710 --> 01:35:41,730
That is the less grass.

2191
01:35:41,910 --> 01:35:43,350
We can only have like...

2192
01:35:43,350 --> 01:35:43,850
Medium?

2193
01:35:44,370 --> 01:35:44,850
Or...

2194
01:35:44,850 --> 01:35:45,350
Alright.

2195
01:35:45,530 --> 01:35:45,750
Okay.

2196
01:35:47,010 --> 01:35:47,390
Low.

2197
01:35:47,930 --> 01:35:48,370
Okay.

2198
01:35:50,030 --> 01:35:51,810
I don't know why it's staggering a little.

2199
01:35:52,050 --> 01:35:53,510
It's not that bad, but...

2200
01:35:53,890 --> 01:35:54,210
Uh...

2201
01:35:54,210 --> 01:35:55,130
It's still a little annoying.

2202
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:00,820
I did...

2203
01:36:00,820 --> 01:36:02,140
I bought a CPU upgrade.

2204
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:03,120
So maybe that'll fi...

2205
01:36:03,120 --> 01:36:04,100
I hope that fixes it.

2206
01:36:05,320 --> 01:36:05,800
What?

2207
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:08,040
Oh, hi.

2208
01:36:10,660 --> 01:36:11,420
Oh shit!

2209
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:11,760
Bye!

2210
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:21,280
Alright, well...

2211
01:36:22,440 --> 01:36:22,920
Alright.

2212
01:36:25,540 --> 01:36:27,000
I haven't installed it yet.

2213
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:29,400
I haven't...

2214
01:36:29,940 --> 01:36:30,340
Uh...

2215
01:36:30,340 --> 01:36:30,680
Guys!

2216
01:36:30,820 --> 01:36:32,460
I need to find a grace first!

2217
01:36:32,660 --> 01:36:32,940
Oh my god.

2218
01:36:33,020 --> 01:36:34,140
Did you guys lie about the grace?

2219
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,140
Did you guys fucking...

2220
01:36:39,640 --> 01:36:41,140
Did you guys...

2221
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:44,120
Where is it?

2222
01:36:44,260 --> 01:36:45,060
Oh, it's right here.

2223
01:36:45,220 --> 01:36:45,820
Okay, I see it.

2224
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:46,440
It's right here.

2225
01:36:47,020 --> 01:36:47,980
Alright, we'll fight him.

2226
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:52,000
I literally just missed it.

2227
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:56,440
Alright, we'll fight him.

2228
01:36:59,520 --> 01:36:59,900
Okay.

2229
01:36:59,900 --> 01:37:00,640
After I do this.

2230
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:02,780
After I sit down and relax a little.

2231
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:05,280
Oh, I can have flask.

2232
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:05,580
Okay.

2233
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:06,720
Wait, we need the flask.

2234
01:37:12,100 --> 01:37:12,860
Okay, nice.

2235
01:37:14,780 --> 01:37:15,800
Oh, I wanna talk to her.

2236
01:37:15,980 --> 01:37:16,300
Hi!

2237
01:37:22,060 --> 01:37:22,440
Eh?

2238
01:37:23,660 --> 01:37:24,040
Lady?

2239
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:26,820
The character who vanished long ago.

2240
01:37:27,060 --> 01:37:30,940
If you wish, I will share them with you.

2241
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:32,580
Share.

2242
01:37:32,980 --> 01:37:37,140
In Marika's own words, hear me, demigods.

2243
01:37:37,660 --> 01:37:44,060
My children, beloved, make of thyselves that which he desires.

2244
01:37:44,060 --> 01:37:58,600
Here, be it a lord, be it a god, but should ye fail to become aught at all, ye will be forsaken, amounting only to sacrifices.

2245
01:38:01,310 --> 01:38:01,700
Cool.

2246
01:38:02,680 --> 01:38:04,700
I-I don't really understand, but cool.

2247
01:38:09,620 --> 01:38:10,400
That's...

2248
01:38:10,950 --> 01:38:11,920
That's a cool story.

2249
01:38:14,060 --> 01:38:15,520
Alright, goodbye, m'lady.

2250
01:38:16,760 --> 01:38:17,680
Nice talk.

2251
01:38:18,940 --> 01:38:21,240
Oh, he comes... Okay, he still pretends...

2252
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:24,360
I-I don't understand why he's still pretending that I didn't see him transforming.

2253
01:38:24,900 --> 01:38:26,840
He's like, don't worry.

2254
01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:28,900
She won't know.

2255
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:32,500
She won't... She won't know a second time.

2256
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:40,360
There's no possible way she'll know a second time when I transform.

2257
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:42,240
Alright.

2258
01:38:43,100 --> 01:38:43,580
Let's...

2259
01:38:44,820 --> 01:38:46,500
He's just a little guy.

2260
01:38:47,120 --> 01:38:48,960
Guys, don't never know.

2261
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:50,920
I wonder if like...

2262
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:51,880
Okay, I think I...

2263
01:38:51,880 --> 01:38:52,700
Maybe if I...

2264
01:38:52,700 --> 01:38:52,900
Okay.

2265
01:38:53,480 --> 01:38:54,920
I fix the center like this.

2266
01:38:55,080 --> 01:38:55,740
Alright, here you go.

2267
01:39:02,860 --> 01:39:04,060
Wait, can I not summon?

2268
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:06,600
Oh my god, I can't summon.

2269
01:39:07,060 --> 01:39:07,940
Oh my god.

2270
01:39:10,380 --> 01:39:11,240
Oh my god.

2271
01:39:11,240 --> 01:39:11,260
Oh my god.

2272
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:13,200
What do you mean I can't summon?

2273
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:14,940
Oh my god, what do you mean?

2274
01:39:20,640 --> 01:39:22,980
It doesn't have to be a boss to summon, guys!

2275
01:39:27,340 --> 01:39:28,860
Oh my god.

2276
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:30,320
I forgot.

2277
01:39:30,680 --> 01:39:30,760
Oh.

2278
01:39:33,680 --> 01:39:34,820
Oh shit!

2279
01:39:37,870 --> 01:39:38,790
Where am I?

2280
01:39:39,970 --> 01:39:40,950
Where am I?

2281
01:39:42,370 --> 01:39:44,770
Oh my god, he just throws shit at me!

2282
01:39:50,300 --> 01:39:50,940
Shit.

2283
01:39:52,420 --> 01:39:55,820
Look, he did something!

2284
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:57,260
What are you doing?

2285
01:39:57,440 --> 01:39:58,700
I'm sorry, I'm panicking!

2286
01:40:00,580 --> 01:40:01,930
I don't have my jellyfish!

2287
01:40:02,820 --> 01:40:05,100
He's gone and I'm scared!

2288
01:40:09,780 --> 01:40:11,820
I don't know what to do when...

2289
01:40:11,820 --> 01:40:12,700
He's gone!

2290
01:40:19,750 --> 01:40:20,530
Oh my god.

2291
01:40:20,690 --> 01:40:21,910
I almost forgot to do this.

2292
01:40:25,510 --> 01:40:26,050
Okay.

2293
01:40:26,370 --> 01:40:27,170
Okay, we did it.

2294
01:40:27,350 --> 01:40:28,070
We did it.

2295
01:40:28,230 --> 01:40:28,930
Oh, thank god.

2296
01:40:29,310 --> 01:40:30,230
First try!

2297
01:40:34,170 --> 01:40:34,830
Alright.

2298
01:40:35,350 --> 01:40:36,150
It wasn't that bad.

2299
01:40:39,090 --> 01:40:39,750
Oh.

2300
01:40:40,650 --> 01:40:41,310
Nice.

2301
01:40:42,030 --> 01:40:43,870
Okay, everything is okay now.

2302
01:40:44,890 --> 01:40:45,510
Yippee!

2303
01:40:46,210 --> 01:40:47,170
Wait, where's the...

2304
01:40:47,170 --> 01:40:47,630
Grace?

2305
01:40:48,610 --> 01:40:49,370
It's right here.

2306
01:40:51,170 --> 01:40:51,590
Oh!

2307
01:40:53,870 --> 01:40:55,110
Where did I...

2308
01:40:56,030 --> 01:40:57,370
Oh my god, it's right here.

2309
01:40:57,550 --> 01:40:57,950
Oh my god.

2310
01:40:58,490 --> 01:40:59,050
I...

2311
01:41:00,190 --> 01:41:00,850
Wait.

2312
01:41:04,370 --> 01:41:04,810
Where...

2313
01:41:04,810 --> 01:41:05,730
Oh, it's right here.

2314
01:41:07,550 --> 01:41:08,430
I'm sorry.

2315
01:41:08,610 --> 01:41:09,570
I'm so lost.

2316
01:41:10,150 --> 01:41:10,470
I...

2317
01:41:10,470 --> 01:41:11,370
I don't know.

2318
01:41:11,810 --> 01:41:13,510
The map don't go...

2319
01:41:13,950 --> 01:41:14,390
Alright.

2320
01:41:14,630 --> 01:41:14,850
Nice.

2321
01:41:15,030 --> 01:41:15,690
We're okay now.

2322
01:41:17,710 --> 01:41:18,490
Oh, it's good?

2323
01:41:18,670 --> 01:41:18,890
Alright.

2324
01:41:19,290 --> 01:41:19,890
Let me...

2325
01:41:19,890 --> 01:41:21,090
Let me grab...

2326
01:41:21,090 --> 01:41:21,750
Grab it.

2327
01:41:23,950 --> 01:41:24,390
Really?

2328
01:41:24,590 --> 01:41:25,350
Oh, it's stamina!

2329
01:41:25,670 --> 01:41:26,570
Okay, that's good actually.

2330
01:41:29,830 --> 01:41:30,270
This?

2331
01:41:30,490 --> 01:41:31,110
Oh, I can have another.

2332
01:41:31,270 --> 01:41:31,450
Nice.

2333
01:41:31,450 --> 01:41:34,950
Oh wait, I should...

2334
01:41:36,210 --> 01:41:37,750
Should I like...

2335
01:41:38,570 --> 01:41:39,730
Put it on that?

2336
01:41:42,330 --> 01:41:43,750
Do I want more focus?

2337
01:41:46,620 --> 01:41:47,580
Or...

2338
01:41:47,580 --> 01:41:48,400
Look at that?

2339
01:41:49,740 --> 01:41:50,320
Yeah.

2340
01:41:51,460 --> 01:41:52,580
Isn't Vitality good?

2341
01:41:57,890 --> 01:41:58,650
This one?

2342
01:42:01,870 --> 01:42:04,650
She finally quipped the third one!

2343
01:42:07,150 --> 01:42:07,650
Alright.

2344
01:42:09,650 --> 01:42:11,210
Alright, we're okay now.

2345
01:42:12,250 --> 01:42:14,570
And now we can go up that scary hill.

2346
01:42:21,390 --> 01:42:22,670
Equip back the blue...

2347
01:42:22,670 --> 01:42:23,830
Yeah, but...

2348
01:42:25,470 --> 01:42:26,470
This isn't...

2349
01:42:26,470 --> 01:42:27,570
Maximum HP is good.

2350
01:42:27,930 --> 01:42:28,410
I get more...

2351
01:42:28,410 --> 01:42:29,310
Oh wait, I should go back.

2352
01:42:29,670 --> 01:42:30,590
For my HP.

2353
01:42:31,050 --> 01:42:32,330
I forgot it doesn't like...

2354
01:42:32,330 --> 01:42:33,130
You have to go back.

2355
01:42:34,790 --> 01:42:36,230
Did I max my flask?

2356
01:42:36,330 --> 01:42:37,150
Oh, I didn't?

2357
01:42:37,350 --> 01:42:37,750
Oh shit.

2358
01:42:38,490 --> 01:42:39,210
I thought...

2359
01:42:39,210 --> 01:42:40,590
No, it's cause I...

2360
01:42:40,590 --> 01:42:41,870
I healed one time.

2361
01:42:47,740 --> 01:42:49,680
Wait, didn't I already max it up?

2362
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:51,280
Did I not?

2363
01:42:55,560 --> 01:42:56,400
What do you mean?

2364
01:42:57,240 --> 01:42:58,720
Oh, mixed flask?

2365
01:42:58,720 --> 01:42:59,160
Oh!

2366
01:42:59,700 --> 01:43:00,060
Fuck!

2367
01:43:00,920 --> 01:43:02,380
I forgot about this guy.

2368
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:05,580
We have nothing to mix it with.

2369
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:07,920
I don't even have anything to mix it with.

2370
01:43:08,100 --> 01:43:08,760
Okay, it doesn't matter.

2371
01:43:09,160 --> 01:43:09,440
I...

2372
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:10,080
I have nothing.

2373
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:14,840
Guys.

2374
01:43:15,060 --> 01:43:15,800
Wait, he's back.

2375
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:17,300
Wait, I can farm him.

2376
01:43:18,940 --> 01:43:20,900
Wait, he just comes back like that?

2377
01:43:23,700 --> 01:43:25,540
Wait, I can farm this guy.

2378
01:43:25,540 --> 01:43:27,420
Oh, he's just a regular guy.

2379
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:28,320
Nevermind.

2380
01:43:29,260 --> 01:43:29,780
Nevermind.

2381
01:43:29,980 --> 01:43:30,620
I was like, whoa!

2382
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:34,280
How?

2383
01:43:37,060 --> 01:43:39,700
People are just like, how do you have nothing?

2384
01:43:42,100 --> 01:43:43,220
Guys, I just...

2385
01:43:43,220 --> 01:43:43,680
I don't know.

2386
01:43:44,240 --> 01:43:45,220
It's just...

2387
01:43:45,220 --> 01:43:47,100
Just the way it is.

2388
01:43:47,940 --> 01:43:48,960
It's been...

2389
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:49,500
It's been...

2390
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:50,240
It's been what?

2391
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:50,820
Five?

2392
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:51,720
Six screams?

2393
01:43:52,220 --> 01:43:54,340
Do you not question Toki?

2394
01:43:54,340 --> 01:43:54,560
Like...

2395
01:43:55,150 --> 01:43:56,080
It literally...

2396
01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:57,380
It's just like...

2397
01:43:57,380 --> 01:43:57,840
How?

2398
01:44:02,920 --> 01:44:05,340
How it comes with one tear?

2399
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:08,180
Honestly, it's impressive.

2400
01:44:09,560 --> 01:44:10,580
I don't know.

2401
01:44:10,740 --> 01:44:11,240
I just...

2402
01:44:11,240 --> 01:44:12,180
It never showed up.

2403
01:44:12,340 --> 01:44:13,560
It just never showed up!

2404
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:14,580
I never had to!

2405
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:15,000
Okay?

2406
01:44:17,900 --> 01:44:19,560
It never came up!

2407
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:25,140
Okay.

2408
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:28,500
Uh...

2409
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:29,760
I think that's enough, actually.

2410
01:44:30,060 --> 01:44:30,760
Should have enough.

2411
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:32,280
For one more upgrade.

2412
01:44:32,420 --> 01:44:32,780
Alright, guys.

2413
01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:34,240
It's time to help me decide what to get.

2414
01:44:34,460 --> 01:44:34,900
What's upgrade.

2415
01:44:35,680 --> 01:44:35,980
Yeah.

2416
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:37,000
That should be it.

2417
01:44:44,840 --> 01:44:45,260
Alright.

2418
01:44:47,860 --> 01:44:48,820
Wait, where's the...

2419
01:44:48,820 --> 01:44:49,740
Oh, it's right back up here.

2420
01:44:50,580 --> 01:44:51,960
Oh, dexterity to 40.

2421
01:44:52,140 --> 01:44:52,300
Okay.

2422
01:44:52,300 --> 01:44:52,320
Okay.

2423
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:56,400
I think that's enough.

2424
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:00,740
Oops, not flask.

2425
01:45:03,560 --> 01:45:04,060
Alright.

2426
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:08,700
Alright, let's go.

2427
01:45:10,580 --> 01:45:13,120
I assume we deal with the lightning sentinel.

2428
01:45:13,500 --> 01:45:14,200
Over there.

2429
01:45:14,680 --> 01:45:16,840
Last time I fought that guy, I was the archer.

2430
01:45:16,940 --> 01:45:17,940
And that was so easy.

2431
01:45:17,940 --> 01:45:19,680
That's the archer.

2432
01:45:21,120 --> 01:45:22,180
So, not that.

2433
01:45:22,500 --> 01:45:23,600
Castle over here.

2434
01:45:29,280 --> 01:45:30,240
Not that.

2435
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:31,180
From up here.

2436
01:45:32,040 --> 01:45:33,200
What's up here?

2437
01:45:35,200 --> 01:45:36,560
What's up here, though?

2438
01:45:37,200 --> 01:45:38,580
It looks so scary.

2439
01:45:41,460 --> 01:45:42,920
Oh, is it closed?

2440
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:43,960
Oh!

2441
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:47,820
It cannot open.

2442
01:45:48,020 --> 01:45:48,380
Oh!

2443
01:45:49,100 --> 01:45:49,500
Okay.

2444
01:45:52,220 --> 01:45:52,820
Alright.

2445
01:45:54,160 --> 01:45:55,480
Do we go...

2446
01:45:55,480 --> 01:45:56,460
This way?

2447
01:45:56,780 --> 01:45:57,600
Or around?

2448
01:45:57,720 --> 01:45:58,520
Oh, do we go around?

2449
01:45:58,720 --> 01:45:59,140
Like here.

2450
01:45:59,580 --> 01:46:00,600
Do we go this way?

2451
01:46:03,620 --> 01:46:04,520
This way?

2452
01:46:05,720 --> 01:46:06,320
Or...

2453
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:07,260
Oh, okay.

2454
01:46:08,140 --> 01:46:08,740
Okay.

2455
01:46:10,140 --> 01:46:11,740
Alright, we go around then.

2456
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:15,420
But technically, the tree sentinels are story bosses, right?

2457
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:19,360
Technically, I just defeated a story...

2458
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:20,140
Oh my god, thank god.

2459
01:46:20,620 --> 01:46:22,460
I finally defeated a story boss.

2460
01:46:25,480 --> 01:46:26,960
Okay, but they are mandatory!

2461
01:46:27,420 --> 01:46:28,140
Okay, technically...

2462
01:46:28,140 --> 01:46:28,540
Actually, no.

2463
01:46:28,680 --> 01:46:29,480
Cause I can just run away.

2464
01:46:29,620 --> 01:46:30,020
Nevermind.

2465
01:46:30,660 --> 01:46:31,080
Nevermind.

2466
01:46:31,220 --> 01:46:31,780
I literally...

2467
01:46:31,780 --> 01:46:33,280
You can literally just run away from them.

2468
01:46:33,560 --> 01:46:35,740
You don't have to fight them.

2469
01:46:36,420 --> 01:46:37,120
I forgot.

2470
01:46:40,300 --> 01:46:42,680
They are definitely 100% optional.

2471
01:46:43,420 --> 01:46:44,860
I guess I follow this pathway.

2472
01:46:46,300 --> 01:46:47,000
I assume.

2473
01:46:48,540 --> 01:46:49,440
What's that sound?

2474
01:46:53,560 --> 01:46:54,700
Can't be that bad, right?

2475
01:46:57,140 --> 01:46:58,540
Okay, I feel like I have to go around.

2476
01:47:01,180 --> 01:47:02,540
I feel like it's down here.

2477
01:47:04,020 --> 01:47:05,200
I don't think it's up here.

2478
01:47:09,560 --> 01:47:12,000
Does not seem like a place where I should be.

2479
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:17,500
What is up here?

2480
01:47:18,580 --> 01:47:19,700
Oh, there's items.

2481
01:47:19,980 --> 01:47:20,200
Okay.

2482
01:47:21,660 --> 01:47:22,380
Oh, it's like...

2483
01:47:22,380 --> 01:47:23,380
I can't believe they don't guard it.

2484
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:28,260
Oh, fuck!

2485
01:47:28,380 --> 01:47:29,260
I thought I was faster!

2486
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:29,840
Oh my god.

2487
01:47:30,120 --> 01:47:30,880
Oh my god.

2488
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:31,560
Not the trees.

2489
01:47:32,120 --> 01:47:32,400
Okay.

2490
01:47:33,140 --> 01:47:33,640
It's fine.

2491
01:47:33,640 --> 01:47:34,340
I got away.

2492
01:47:35,260 --> 01:47:35,860
It's okay.

2493
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:36,800
I still got away.

2494
01:47:37,180 --> 01:47:38,320
I was like...

2495
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:38,520
Ha ha!

2496
01:47:38,840 --> 01:47:39,780
Dodge this!

2497
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:41,720
Oh yeah.

2498
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:42,280
Another item.

2499
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:43,980
Nice.

2500
01:47:44,180 --> 01:47:44,620
We needed that.

2501
01:47:46,780 --> 01:47:48,080
And then we'll go down here.

2502
01:47:55,530 --> 01:47:55,970
Alright.

2503
01:47:57,030 --> 01:47:58,050
And then we go around.

2504
01:47:58,230 --> 01:47:58,510
Oh hey!

2505
01:47:58,670 --> 01:47:59,090
Free souls!

2506
01:48:00,510 --> 01:48:01,990
I thought there's somebody died there.

2507
01:48:03,830 --> 01:48:05,930
Somebody died in front of me, but I don't know why.

2508
01:48:09,290 --> 01:48:09,850
Oh!

2509
01:48:14,510 --> 01:48:15,910
I think I know why.

2510
01:48:16,310 --> 01:48:17,270
Okay, now I know.

2511
01:48:17,450 --> 01:48:18,910
Now I know how he died.

2512
01:48:19,170 --> 01:48:19,290
Okay.

2513
01:48:20,190 --> 01:48:20,750
Um...

2514
01:48:21,970 --> 01:48:22,530
Ooh!

2515
01:48:23,930 --> 01:48:25,470
Guys, I think I know!

2516
01:48:27,030 --> 01:48:28,590
I think I know now!

2517
01:48:30,570 --> 01:48:31,130
Oh!

2518
01:48:31,270 --> 01:48:31,510
God!

2519
01:48:31,850 --> 01:48:32,030
Oh!

2520
01:48:32,910 --> 01:48:33,470
Whoa!

2521
01:48:33,750 --> 01:48:34,070
Okay.

2522
01:48:34,690 --> 01:48:35,250
Okay.

2523
01:48:35,650 --> 01:48:36,230
It's okay.

2524
01:48:36,430 --> 01:48:36,730
It's okay.

2525
01:48:36,810 --> 01:48:37,770
I'm faster than here.

2526
01:48:38,350 --> 01:48:38,790
I...

2527
01:48:40,410 --> 01:48:40,850
I...

2528
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:44,440
Oh!

2529
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:45,120
Oh!

2530
01:48:45,240 --> 01:48:45,840
There he is!

2531
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:46,760
Oh!

2532
01:48:46,840 --> 01:48:47,460
There he is!

2533
01:48:47,540 --> 01:48:48,260
I see him!

2534
01:48:48,760 --> 01:48:49,480
Hey there, buddy!

2535
01:48:51,660 --> 01:48:52,100
Oh!

2536
01:48:52,200 --> 01:48:53,020
But there's a cool...

2537
01:48:53,020 --> 01:48:53,600
Look at that!

2538
01:48:53,660 --> 01:48:55,100
There's a guy over here though!

2539
01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:56,160
Okay, I see him.

2540
01:48:56,620 --> 01:48:56,960
Oh!

2541
01:48:57,220 --> 01:48:57,660
Oh!

2542
01:48:57,800 --> 01:48:58,380
I see him!

2543
01:48:58,500 --> 01:48:59,300
There he is!

2544
01:48:59,460 --> 01:49:00,560
Look at that little fella!

2545
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:01,360
Oh!

2546
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:02,860
Not very little, but look at him!

2547
01:49:02,920 --> 01:49:03,540
There he is!

2548
01:49:03,700 --> 01:49:03,900
Whoa!

2549
01:49:03,900 --> 01:49:04,020
Oh!

2550
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:08,080
Okay.

2551
01:49:12,790 --> 01:49:13,770
What the fuck are you?

2552
01:49:13,870 --> 01:49:14,310
Oh my God!

2553
01:49:14,430 --> 01:49:14,830
Please do not!

2554
01:49:14,930 --> 01:49:15,450
I swear to God!

2555
01:49:15,530 --> 01:49:18,090
If you aggro the big ass man over there, I swear to God!

2556
01:49:22,540 --> 01:49:23,700
Okay, she's just missing.

2557
01:49:23,920 --> 01:49:24,060
Okay.

2558
01:49:26,440 --> 01:49:26,760
Oh!

2559
01:49:28,460 --> 01:49:28,980
Oh!

2560
01:49:28,980 --> 01:49:29,100
Oh!

2561
01:49:33,220 --> 01:49:33,360
Oh!

2562
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:33,400
Okay.

2563
01:49:35,940 --> 01:49:36,420
Okay.

2564
01:49:36,420 --> 01:49:36,660
That's fine.

2565
01:49:36,780 --> 01:49:37,020
Oh!

2566
01:49:37,160 --> 01:49:37,360
Nice!

2567
01:49:38,920 --> 01:49:39,940
Oh my God!

2568
01:49:40,120 --> 01:49:40,340
No!

2569
01:49:41,500 --> 01:49:42,020
Jellyfish!

2570
01:49:43,640 --> 01:49:44,080
Oh.

2571
01:49:44,220 --> 01:49:44,460
Oh my God!

2572
01:50:01,690 --> 01:50:02,570
Jesus Christ!

2573
01:50:03,190 --> 01:50:03,290
Oh!

2574
01:50:03,470 --> 01:50:04,530
He does so much!

2575
01:50:04,710 --> 01:50:05,090
Guys!

2576
01:50:05,210 --> 01:50:06,330
He does so much damage!

2577
01:50:06,470 --> 01:50:07,750
I forgot to send up messages!

2578
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:15,840
Oh!

2579
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:15,960
Oh!

2580
01:50:15,960 --> 01:50:16,520
There it is!

2581
01:50:20,830 --> 01:50:21,270
Oh!

2582
01:50:21,370 --> 01:50:22,110
There it is!

2583
01:50:22,270 --> 01:50:22,390
Oh!

2584
01:50:22,570 --> 01:50:23,310
There it is!

2585
01:50:23,530 --> 01:50:23,930
Wow!

2586
01:50:24,990 --> 01:50:25,430
Wow!

2587
01:50:35,260 --> 01:50:36,760
I'm distracted because she died!

2588
01:50:37,740 --> 01:50:39,280
I was like, how did she die?

2589
01:50:39,300 --> 01:50:40,240
How did she die?

2590
01:50:43,740 --> 01:50:46,320
Oh my god, please.

2591
01:50:49,300 --> 01:50:50,340
Holy shit.

2592
01:50:51,740 --> 01:50:54,540
I got so distracted, it's not fair.

2593
01:50:55,400 --> 01:50:56,620
Oh my god.

2594
01:50:58,420 --> 01:50:59,440
Wait, I'm stuck.

2595
01:51:04,380 --> 01:51:06,820
Wait, I'm stuck.

2596
01:51:07,020 --> 01:51:07,700
I'm stuck.

2597
01:51:07,960 --> 01:51:09,400
Oh, I'm stuck!

2598
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:11,000
Guys, message refresh, please, please, please, please, please.

2599
01:51:11,160 --> 01:51:11,700
I'm stuck.

2600
01:51:11,880 --> 01:51:12,820
I'm actually stuck.

2601
01:51:13,020 --> 01:51:13,320
Please.

2602
01:51:13,340 --> 01:51:13,420
Please.

2603
01:51:13,820 --> 01:51:15,020
I'm stuck.

2604
01:51:17,320 --> 01:51:19,060
Oh my god.

2605
01:51:19,980 --> 01:51:23,360
I thought he was the one that was stuck.

2606
01:51:24,120 --> 01:51:24,720
JK.

2607
01:51:26,120 --> 01:51:26,960
JK.

2608
01:51:28,300 --> 01:51:29,420
Silly me.

2609
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:32,160
I was the stuck one in the end.

2610
01:51:34,280 --> 01:51:35,320
Oh fuck.

2611
01:51:42,560 --> 01:51:43,860
Oh my god.

2612
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:46,960
Oh my god.

2613
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:47,540
Okay, I need to heal.

2614
01:51:47,740 --> 01:51:48,900
I don't trust myself.

2615
01:51:52,970 --> 01:51:53,370
Woo!

2616
01:51:55,850 --> 01:51:56,550
Oh my god.

2617
01:51:56,650 --> 01:51:57,770
I don't trust myself at all.

2618
01:52:01,730 --> 01:52:02,410
Oh no.

2619
01:52:02,810 --> 01:52:03,570
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2620
01:52:06,470 --> 01:52:06,870
Oh!

2621
01:52:10,750 --> 01:52:11,630
Okay, I'm focusing.

2622
01:52:11,850 --> 01:52:13,570
I'm actually locking it in right now.

2623
01:52:26,550 --> 01:52:27,970
Oh my god.

2624
01:52:31,620 --> 01:52:32,590
First try!

2625
01:52:34,110 --> 01:52:35,210
I'm scared!

2626
01:52:38,850 --> 01:52:40,930
Oh my god!

2627
01:52:41,290 --> 01:52:44,450
Oh my fucking god!

2628
01:52:47,750 --> 01:52:50,250
Oh my god!

2629
01:52:51,170 --> 01:52:54,950
Oh, I don't know how I did that, right?

2630
01:52:56,090 --> 01:52:56,790
We fell.

2631
01:53:01,790 --> 01:53:03,110
What, like, it was hard?

2632
01:53:03,570 --> 01:53:06,450
I can't believe you guys were so scared of this sentinel.

2633
01:53:07,330 --> 01:53:09,790
I can't believe you guys were that scared.

2634
01:53:10,150 --> 01:53:11,290
It was pretty easy.

2635
01:53:16,150 --> 01:53:19,870
It's pretty fucking... I'm not even gonna meme on ya.

2636
01:53:20,050 --> 01:53:22,230
I'm actually impressed.

2637
01:53:22,910 --> 01:53:25,030
Johnny, thank you for the super chat.

2638
01:53:25,190 --> 01:53:26,370
Thank you, thank you.

2639
01:53:26,370 --> 01:53:28,750
Guys, you guys died to that?

2640
01:53:28,950 --> 01:53:29,930
Fucking, wow.

2641
01:53:35,110 --> 01:53:38,450
That guy took me three hours.

2642
01:53:42,190 --> 01:53:43,530
Like it was hard?

2643
01:53:47,120 --> 01:53:48,470
That was pretty easy.

2644
01:53:49,090 --> 01:53:50,850
Alright, we did a story boss, guys.

2645
01:53:51,130 --> 01:53:52,210
We fucking did it.

2646
01:53:59,070 --> 01:54:00,490
I'm sure you don't have the right.

2647
01:54:00,630 --> 01:54:01,910
Oh, you don't have the right.

2648
01:54:02,290 --> 01:54:03,870
Be wary of drag.

2649
01:54:04,050 --> 01:54:05,370
I don't wanna hear...

2650
01:54:06,570 --> 01:54:08,810
Everyone stop appraising till you...

2651
01:54:08,810 --> 01:54:09,170
What?

2652
01:54:09,410 --> 01:54:10,450
Oh, I'm sorry.

2653
01:54:10,750 --> 01:54:11,390
Skill dip.

2654
01:54:15,550 --> 01:54:21,710
I don't wanna be salty as you got dipped by an anime girl.

2655
01:54:24,890 --> 01:54:27,550
Give me back my congratulations.

2656
01:54:27,550 --> 01:54:36,930
I don't know her ego.

2657
01:54:41,050 --> 01:54:43,330
Alan, thank you for the super chat.

2658
01:54:43,490 --> 01:54:44,550
Thank you, thank you.

2659
01:54:46,330 --> 01:54:49,630
Doki failing multiple times at regular tree sentinel.

2660
01:54:49,850 --> 01:54:52,110
Just the first try to trick Koenig one.

2661
01:54:52,110 --> 01:54:53,590
Doki moment.

2662
01:54:53,870 --> 01:54:55,110
Thank you for the super chat.

2663
01:54:55,290 --> 01:54:56,150
Thank you, thank you.

2664
01:54:56,430 --> 01:54:57,330
Guys, come on.

2665
01:54:57,490 --> 01:54:58,570
I don't mean that.

2666
01:54:59,190 --> 01:55:01,130
Guys, I love your appraisals.

2667
01:55:01,310 --> 01:55:01,810
Guys, come on.

2668
01:55:02,170 --> 01:55:03,990
I couldn't have done it, guys.

2669
01:55:04,090 --> 01:55:05,430
Without your appraisals.

2670
01:55:05,550 --> 01:55:05,950
Come on.

2671
01:55:09,730 --> 01:55:10,310
Alright.

2672
01:55:11,210 --> 01:55:12,630
Let's get this finger remedy.

2673
01:55:14,070 --> 01:55:15,150
Too late.

2674
01:55:17,130 --> 01:55:19,630
I demand appraisal refund.

2675
01:55:20,530 --> 01:55:21,330
Behold, city.

2676
01:55:21,490 --> 01:55:21,630
Ooh.

2677
01:55:22,270 --> 01:55:22,690
Oh, wait.

2678
01:55:22,850 --> 01:55:24,630
Is it... Is it... Was it the...

2679
01:55:24,630 --> 01:55:26,010
Irwood tree or something?

2680
01:55:26,370 --> 01:55:27,030
Your tree.

2681
01:55:30,550 --> 01:55:32,650
Would this be a traitor or a friend?

2682
01:55:33,090 --> 01:55:33,350
Oh.

2683
01:55:33,790 --> 01:55:35,750
I don't think I should do anything.

2684
01:55:36,650 --> 01:55:37,330
Dog.

2685
01:55:37,590 --> 01:55:37,810
I...

2686
01:55:38,490 --> 01:55:39,630
That's fucked up.

2687
01:55:40,030 --> 01:55:41,390
That's a person.

2688
01:55:41,910 --> 01:55:42,630
Holy shit.

2689
01:55:43,530 --> 01:55:45,030
Just getting started.

2690
01:55:45,270 --> 01:55:46,290
Wait, how did these guys die?

2691
01:55:53,170 --> 01:55:53,730
Okay.

2692
01:55:54,390 --> 01:55:55,150
Yeah, that makes sense.

2693
01:55:55,830 --> 01:55:56,910
Or just be a head.

2694
01:55:58,450 --> 01:55:59,750
Bro, bro.

2695
01:55:59,910 --> 01:56:00,890
This guy just went like...

2696
01:56:04,090 --> 01:56:05,850
Stupid ass man.

2697
01:56:07,130 --> 01:56:07,950
He slipped.

2698
01:56:09,250 --> 01:56:11,450
Be wary of a head.

2699
01:56:12,650 --> 01:56:13,970
Why is there always recklessness?

2700
01:56:14,270 --> 01:56:14,610
Oh, hey.

2701
01:56:15,470 --> 01:56:16,430
There's a grace, though.

2702
01:56:18,610 --> 01:56:19,770
He tripped.

2703
01:56:23,940 --> 01:56:25,700
Don't listen to anyone, Stokey.

2704
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:28,340
You're the best Elden Ranked player in history.

2705
01:56:28,860 --> 01:56:30,020
I kneel.

2706
01:56:30,140 --> 01:56:33,120
I never remembered that you were in the super chat.

2707
01:56:33,340 --> 01:56:33,640
Thank you.

2708
01:56:33,820 --> 01:56:34,340
Thank you.

2709
01:56:35,480 --> 01:56:35,780
Nice.

2710
01:56:37,040 --> 01:56:38,460
Alright, let's go this way.

2711
01:56:39,560 --> 01:56:39,960
Oh, wait.

2712
01:56:40,080 --> 01:56:41,080
That's so beautiful.

2713
01:56:41,880 --> 01:56:42,080
Wait.

2714
01:56:42,720 --> 01:56:44,220
Could this be Elden Ring?

2715
01:56:44,460 --> 01:56:45,260
Wait, is that...

2716
01:56:45,260 --> 01:56:46,200
Is that Elden Ring?

2717
01:56:46,480 --> 01:56:46,840
Hahaha.

2718
01:56:50,240 --> 01:56:51,200
That's so pretty.

2719
01:56:51,480 --> 01:56:52,380
Why is this city...

2720
01:56:52,380 --> 01:56:52,860
Oh, never mind.

2721
01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:53,360
I was gonna say.

2722
01:56:53,560 --> 01:56:54,840
This city looks like...

2723
01:56:54,840 --> 01:56:56,180
Untouched and everything.

2724
01:56:56,940 --> 01:56:57,760
Are they bad?

2725
01:56:58,660 --> 01:56:59,940
I mean, they seem...

2726
01:57:01,400 --> 01:57:02,720
They seem like good people.

2727
01:57:02,720 --> 01:57:03,280
Hi.

2728
01:57:05,640 --> 01:57:06,660
Oh, fuck.

2729
01:57:06,920 --> 01:57:07,720
Okay, never mind.

2730
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:08,580
Bad.

2731
01:57:09,340 --> 01:57:09,740
No.

2732
01:57:10,160 --> 01:57:10,340
Bad.

2733
01:57:10,940 --> 01:57:11,380
No.

2734
01:57:12,480 --> 01:57:13,120
Bad.

2735
01:57:13,840 --> 01:57:15,220
Don't you do that again.

2736
01:57:16,340 --> 01:57:16,620
Doot.

2737
01:57:16,760 --> 01:57:18,700
Yeah, she killed me with the doots.

2738
01:57:20,100 --> 01:57:20,980
She did a doot.

2739
01:57:23,440 --> 01:57:24,040
Doot doot.

2740
01:57:24,580 --> 01:57:26,480
Okay, Fred wouldn't do that, though.

2741
01:57:27,240 --> 01:57:28,180
Not Fred.

2742
01:57:29,300 --> 01:57:30,100
If Fred...

2743
01:57:30,100 --> 01:57:31,140
Why is she doot on me?

2744
01:57:32,500 --> 01:57:34,210
Didn't expect lovable sword.

2745
01:57:35,320 --> 01:57:36,100
The doot squad.

2746
01:57:36,840 --> 01:57:37,480
Doot a doot.

2747
01:57:37,580 --> 01:57:37,980
Oh my god.

2748
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:38,880
She's a big dude.

2749
01:57:39,700 --> 01:57:40,500
Oh, shit!

2750
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:41,120
Oh!

2751
01:57:41,360 --> 01:57:42,380
Okay, we both missed out.

2752
01:57:42,600 --> 01:57:44,180
That was embarrassing for both of us again.

2753
01:57:46,260 --> 01:57:46,980
That's fine.

2754
01:57:47,600 --> 01:57:49,620
We both embarrassed ourselves today.

2755
01:57:49,860 --> 01:57:50,600
And that's okay.

2756
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:52,500
Yeah!

2757
01:57:53,700 --> 01:57:54,420
Oh, nice.

2758
01:57:54,540 --> 01:57:55,300
We got Golden Rune.

2759
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:57,160
The huge doot.

2760
01:57:58,020 --> 01:57:58,780
Doot doot.

2761
01:58:00,100 --> 01:58:00,700
Dog ahead.

2762
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:01,460
This guy?

2763
01:58:01,740 --> 01:58:02,540
That's a woman.

2764
01:58:03,850 --> 01:58:04,600
Oh my god!

2765
01:58:04,680 --> 01:58:05,960
What happened?!

2766
01:58:08,280 --> 01:58:08,820
Okay.

2767
01:58:09,440 --> 01:58:10,220
She's a TP.

2768
01:58:10,620 --> 01:58:11,280
Oh no!

2769
01:58:11,460 --> 01:58:11,800
Yeah, no.

2770
01:58:11,900 --> 01:58:12,380
That's a dog.

2771
01:58:12,620 --> 01:58:13,100
Nevermind.

2772
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:15,100
Oh yeah, that's...

2773
01:58:15,100 --> 01:58:15,220
Yeah.

2774
01:58:19,020 --> 01:58:20,100
Okay, um...

2775
01:58:20,100 --> 01:58:20,700
Okay.

2776
01:58:21,040 --> 01:58:21,460
Nevermind.

2777
01:58:21,460 --> 01:58:22,000
That...

2778
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:22,380
No.

2779
01:58:22,680 --> 01:58:22,920
That...

2780
01:58:22,920 --> 01:58:24,200
Yeah, that's the dog, guys.

2781
01:58:25,120 --> 01:58:25,960
There she is.

2782
01:58:27,320 --> 01:58:27,620
What?

2783
01:58:28,720 --> 01:58:29,880
Jesus Christ.

2784
01:58:30,080 --> 01:58:30,880
What the fuck do I do?

2785
01:58:32,060 --> 01:58:34,600
My dog can't do that.

2786
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:38,680
What?!

2787
01:58:39,960 --> 01:58:40,380
What?!

2788
01:58:40,380 --> 01:58:40,780
What?!

2789
01:58:40,780 --> 01:58:41,680
How hip went wall?!

2790
01:58:44,660 --> 01:58:46,360
Okay, let me go down from here.

2791
01:58:51,240 --> 01:58:53,200
I'll do this, and then...

2792
01:58:58,720 --> 01:58:59,560
Wait, not...

2793
01:59:01,900 --> 01:59:02,700
Okay, I'm fine.

2794
01:59:02,860 --> 01:59:03,320
What the fuck?

2795
01:59:03,460 --> 01:59:04,160
Why was I scared?

2796
01:59:08,380 --> 01:59:09,500
Just do that.

2797
01:59:12,520 --> 01:59:13,240
Alright.

2798
01:59:18,920 --> 01:59:19,640
Nice.

2799
01:59:20,380 --> 01:59:21,440
We did it.

2800
01:59:23,040 --> 01:59:24,640
Still no high road.

2801
01:59:25,100 --> 01:59:25,960
What's over here?

2802
01:59:27,320 --> 01:59:28,040
Oh!

2803
01:59:28,320 --> 01:59:29,040
Wait, is this shortcut?

2804
01:59:33,310 --> 01:59:34,290
What's this?

2805
01:59:36,010 --> 01:59:37,130
Try target law?

2806
01:59:39,810 --> 01:59:40,530
No.

2807
01:59:40,550 --> 01:59:40,730
No?

2808
01:59:41,010 --> 01:59:42,470
Wait, was this the way to go then?

2809
01:59:46,950 --> 01:59:48,870
Oh, I keep forgetting to put my lantern on.

2810
01:59:50,450 --> 01:59:50,870
Oh, hey.

2811
01:59:52,950 --> 01:59:53,410
Whoa!

2812
01:59:57,290 --> 01:59:58,210
It's like...

2813
01:59:58,210 --> 01:59:58,650
Hey, buddy.

2814
02:00:01,230 --> 02:00:02,090
I don't know.

2815
02:00:02,250 --> 02:00:02,890
I thought...

2816
02:00:02,890 --> 02:00:03,790
I don't know.

2817
02:00:03,990 --> 02:00:05,450
For some reason, I was like...

2818
02:00:05,450 --> 02:00:05,650
Friend?

2819
02:00:05,830 --> 02:00:06,790
I don't know why.

2820
02:00:07,210 --> 02:00:08,050
I don't know.

2821
02:00:08,910 --> 02:00:10,070
I don't know, guys.

2822
02:00:10,310 --> 02:00:10,750
I keep...

2823
02:00:10,750 --> 02:00:11,430
I'm too friendly.

2824
02:00:11,430 --> 02:00:12,110
I...

2825
02:00:14,230 --> 02:00:15,190
He's like...

2826
02:00:15,190 --> 02:00:16,050
Home Invader!

2827
02:00:17,930 --> 02:00:18,570
Sorry.

2828
02:00:18,570 --> 02:00:20,310
I invaded this man's home.

2829
02:00:20,790 --> 02:00:21,190
I...

2830
02:00:25,680 --> 02:00:26,960
I just...

2831
02:00:27,440 --> 02:00:27,760
Oh.

2832
02:00:31,160 --> 02:00:32,360
Oh, that's sad.

2833
02:00:33,880 --> 02:00:34,940
Oh, my God.

2834
02:00:35,140 --> 02:00:35,740
Oh, my God.

2835
02:00:35,760 --> 02:00:37,040
He's actually limbless.

2836
02:00:37,280 --> 02:00:38,460
Oh, my God.

2837
02:00:38,580 --> 02:00:39,160
This...

2838
02:00:39,160 --> 02:00:39,480
Oh, my...

2839
02:00:39,480 --> 02:00:39,800
Don't worry.

2840
02:00:39,880 --> 02:00:40,460
I freed him.

2841
02:00:42,100 --> 02:00:43,640
I freed this man.

2842
02:00:45,680 --> 02:00:46,900
I freed him.

2843
02:00:47,580 --> 02:00:47,660
I freed him.

2844
02:00:47,660 --> 02:00:48,480
He doesn't have to live.

2845
02:00:48,620 --> 02:00:49,000
Oh, shit.

2846
02:00:49,220 --> 02:00:50,460
There's a dragon over there.

2847
02:00:51,100 --> 02:00:53,400
He can't turn, Toki.

2848
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:56,420
I freed him!

2849
02:00:56,940 --> 02:00:57,380
What was...

2850
02:00:57,380 --> 02:00:58,720
He was gonna suffer anyway.

2851
02:00:58,720 --> 02:01:00,140
Now he's in heaven, guys.

2852
02:01:00,280 --> 02:01:01,220
No, he can no longer...

2853
02:01:02,100 --> 02:01:03,180
Be in pain.

2854
02:01:03,680 --> 02:01:04,860
Don't worry, everyone.

2855
02:01:05,160 --> 02:01:06,020
I freed him.

2856
02:01:06,020 --> 02:01:07,320
Yeah.

2857
02:01:09,680 --> 02:01:10,020
Yeah.

2858
02:01:11,200 --> 02:01:11,800
Yeah.

2859
02:01:11,800 --> 02:01:14,280
He killed an unarmed man.

2860
02:01:14,280 --> 02:01:16,540
What the fuck is wrong with me?

2861
02:01:16,700 --> 02:01:17,180
Guys!

2862
02:01:17,400 --> 02:01:19,120
I freed him from his...

2863
02:01:19,120 --> 02:01:21,080
From his physical prison.

2864
02:01:21,380 --> 02:01:21,540
Okay?

2865
02:01:21,620 --> 02:01:22,760
From his mortal prison.

2866
02:01:22,980 --> 02:01:24,260
He's in heaven now.

2867
02:01:24,400 --> 02:01:25,120
Okay, guys?

2868
02:01:25,360 --> 02:01:26,260
He was suffering.

2869
02:01:26,260 --> 02:01:27,180
I freed him.

2870
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:29,860
I let him.

2871
02:01:36,390 --> 02:01:37,830
He doesn't have to suffer.

2872
02:01:37,990 --> 02:01:38,290
Oh, my God.

2873
02:01:38,370 --> 02:01:39,450
It's a perfumer, man.

2874
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:40,890
It's a perfumer.

2875
02:01:41,210 --> 02:01:43,830
It's a perfumer.

2876
02:01:43,830 --> 02:01:44,170
All right.

2877
02:01:44,230 --> 02:01:44,670
There you go.

2878
02:01:44,810 --> 02:01:45,890
Bye, perfumers.

2879
02:01:49,720 --> 02:01:50,500
There you go.

2880
02:01:51,980 --> 02:01:53,680
No more perfume for you.

2881
02:01:55,280 --> 02:01:56,660
Okay, we go this way.

2882
02:01:56,660 --> 02:01:56,720
Okay.

2883
02:01:59,360 --> 02:02:02,640
Actually, I don't think I need to use the special ones.

2884
02:02:04,360 --> 02:02:04,940
All right.

2885
02:02:06,260 --> 02:02:07,220
Listen carefully.

2886
02:02:08,400 --> 02:02:09,860
Why is there always sadness?

2887
02:02:11,120 --> 02:02:12,120
Oh, like the doots?

2888
02:02:12,940 --> 02:02:14,040
The doot-a-doots?

2889
02:02:17,720 --> 02:02:19,520
Okay, get these guys out of the way.

2890
02:02:20,560 --> 02:02:21,140
Or not.

2891
02:02:21,640 --> 02:02:23,540
They don't deserve to smell good.

2892
02:02:27,480 --> 02:02:28,320
Where do I go?

2893
02:02:28,460 --> 02:02:29,740
There's so many areas to go.

2894
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:32,560
Let's get rid of these guys, though.

2895
02:02:37,420 --> 02:02:37,900
Oh.

2896
02:02:38,120 --> 02:02:38,620
Ooh, item.

2897
02:02:39,560 --> 02:02:40,040
Yeah!

2898
02:02:43,920 --> 02:02:45,000
Kill him first.

2899
02:02:45,140 --> 02:02:46,580
And then, like...

2900
02:02:46,580 --> 02:02:47,180
I'll leave.

2901
02:02:47,600 --> 02:02:48,560
Oh, fuck!

2902
02:02:51,680 --> 02:02:53,280
Okay, I guess I don't leave?

2903
02:02:53,700 --> 02:02:54,060
Question?

2904
02:02:56,040 --> 02:02:56,520
Okay.

2905
02:02:57,240 --> 02:02:58,060
Oh, fuck.

2906
02:02:58,100 --> 02:02:58,800
I don't have enough.

2907
02:02:59,360 --> 02:02:59,860
It's fine.

2908
02:03:02,020 --> 02:03:03,120
I can do this.

2909
02:03:04,620 --> 02:03:05,140
Whoa!

2910
02:03:05,640 --> 02:03:06,780
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

2911
02:03:07,200 --> 02:03:08,060
Jesus Christ.

2912
02:03:08,280 --> 02:03:08,380
Okay.

2913
02:03:11,700 --> 02:03:12,860
Oh, my God!

2914
02:03:12,920 --> 02:03:13,380
That's cheating!

2915
02:03:13,820 --> 02:03:14,820
Stupid fucking nerd.

2916
02:03:15,240 --> 02:03:16,280
That's cheating, you nerd!

2917
02:03:18,360 --> 02:03:19,100
Oh, my God.

2918
02:03:19,220 --> 02:03:20,080
That's stupid nerding.

2919
02:03:22,600 --> 02:03:23,420
Oh, my!

2920
02:03:23,420 --> 02:03:24,100
I was trying to roll.

2921
02:03:25,100 --> 02:03:25,940
I was trying to roll.

2922
02:03:27,680 --> 02:03:28,480
Jesus Christ.

2923
02:03:28,620 --> 02:03:29,720
I hate these guys so much.

2924
02:03:33,560 --> 02:03:33,960
Yeah.

2925
02:03:37,700 --> 02:03:38,060
All right.

2926
02:03:38,520 --> 02:03:38,940
It's fine.

2927
02:03:39,020 --> 02:03:39,940
I still have flasks.

2928
02:03:41,800 --> 02:03:42,500
Ha, ha, ha!

2929
02:03:43,260 --> 02:03:44,200
God damn it.

2930
02:03:44,200 --> 02:03:44,380
God damn it.

2931
02:03:48,010 --> 02:03:49,150
Are you serious?

2932
02:03:49,410 --> 02:03:50,590
I'm in a confined area!

2933
02:03:55,100 --> 02:03:56,100
Oh, my God.

2934
02:03:56,100 --> 02:03:56,780
Oh, my God.

2935
02:03:58,040 --> 02:03:59,000
Okay, we got him.

2936
02:04:00,140 --> 02:04:01,240
Oh, we got him.

2937
02:04:07,110 --> 02:04:08,050
Oh, wait.

2938
02:04:08,270 --> 02:04:08,690
Oh, wait.

2939
02:04:08,850 --> 02:04:09,850
This guy has...

2940
02:04:09,850 --> 02:04:10,930
This guy has...

2941
02:04:10,930 --> 02:04:11,590
Oh, nice bleed.

2942
02:04:11,970 --> 02:04:12,410
That's fine.

2943
02:04:13,350 --> 02:04:14,050
Ha, ha, ha!

2944
02:04:14,370 --> 02:04:15,470
I have bleed!

2945
02:04:16,870 --> 02:04:18,070
That's ra- Oh, shit!

2946
02:04:18,290 --> 02:04:19,190
Oh, no!

2947
02:04:19,770 --> 02:04:19,870
No.

2948
02:04:20,010 --> 02:04:21,070
No, no, no.

2949
02:04:22,050 --> 02:04:24,190
Oh, my God, he scared the shit out of me.

2950
02:04:26,690 --> 02:04:27,490
Oh, shit!

2951
02:04:27,650 --> 02:04:29,010
That guy scared the shit up...

2952
02:04:29,010 --> 02:04:30,030
Oh, he has armors?

2953
02:04:30,870 --> 02:04:31,330
All right.

2954
02:04:31,390 --> 02:04:31,770
There we go.

2955
02:04:32,770 --> 02:04:33,330
That's fine.

2956
02:04:33,950 --> 02:04:34,270
Ohh!

2957
02:04:34,670 --> 02:04:35,670
Oh, we did it.

2958
02:04:36,710 --> 02:04:37,490
We did it.

2959
02:04:39,870 --> 02:04:40,270
Okay.

2960
02:04:40,450 --> 02:04:41,130
Last blast.

2961
02:04:45,110 --> 02:04:45,750
Alright.

2962
02:04:45,750 --> 02:04:47,010
Can't believe it.

2963
02:04:47,110 --> 02:04:50,550
I came to his home and he's here to... Alright.

2964
02:04:54,020 --> 02:04:55,060
Where is he?

2965
02:04:56,220 --> 02:04:57,260
Oh, there you go.

2966
02:05:11,260 --> 02:05:12,480
I'm fucking 13.

2967
02:05:12,560 --> 02:05:13,180
I'm sorry.

2968
02:05:16,260 --> 02:05:17,320
Bush ahead.

2969
02:05:17,600 --> 02:05:17,740
Where?

2970
02:05:19,660 --> 02:05:20,300
Where?

2971
02:05:23,860 --> 02:05:24,500
Okay.

2972
02:05:24,500 --> 02:05:25,180
Okay, bro.

2973
02:05:25,440 --> 02:05:26,100
Okay.

2974
02:05:31,060 --> 02:05:32,100
Oh, here?

2975
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:34,680
Okay, but I need grace.

2976
02:05:34,680 --> 02:05:36,780
I need grace so badly right now.

2977
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:38,540
Is there any grace nearby?

2978
02:05:38,540 --> 02:05:39,520
Holy fuck.

2979
02:05:43,660 --> 02:05:46,180
That was not very nice.

2980
02:05:50,480 --> 02:05:52,140
Okay, no door ahead.

2981
02:05:59,990 --> 02:06:00,270
Okay.

2982
02:06:00,590 --> 02:06:02,630
I'm, like, a little worried right now.

2983
02:06:08,200 --> 02:06:09,420
You where I left?

2984
02:06:11,540 --> 02:06:12,160
Oh.

2985
02:06:13,660 --> 02:06:14,280
Haha!

2986
02:06:14,440 --> 02:06:15,740
You thought I didn't see you.

2987
02:06:18,040 --> 02:06:18,660
Hahaha!

2988
02:06:19,640 --> 02:06:21,580
And now that you helped me, sir.

2989
02:06:25,640 --> 02:06:28,260
Now... Now that you've helped me.

2990
02:06:28,840 --> 02:06:29,180

2991
02:06:29,920 --> 02:06:30,540
Alright.

2992
02:06:31,280 --> 02:06:32,460
Where is it?

2993
02:06:33,460 --> 02:06:34,180
Places.

2994
02:06:34,580 --> 02:06:35,040
Affinity.

2995
02:06:35,540 --> 02:06:36,220
Concept.

2996
02:06:38,780 --> 02:06:39,500
Direction.

2997
02:06:39,780 --> 02:06:40,340
Situation.

2998
02:06:42,520 --> 02:06:46,700
Guys, I'm trying to find a very specific thing here.

2999
02:06:47,900 --> 02:06:48,260
Teacher.

3000
02:06:48,860 --> 02:06:49,180
Lover.

3001
02:06:49,540 --> 02:06:50,160
Ain't wicked.

3002
02:06:50,560 --> 02:06:51,080
Oh, there you go.

3044
02:08:14,880 --> 02:08:15,480
Wait.

3045
02:08:17,760 --> 02:08:19,200
Guys, look at my HP!

3046
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:21,680
Yeah, do you think it is wise for me to go?

3047
02:08:25,180 --> 02:08:28,480
Pass the tree with the big ass guy that fucking floated from above?

3048
02:08:31,520 --> 02:08:32,480
Okay, guys, please.

3049
02:08:32,780 --> 02:08:33,260

Guys, look at me.

3058
02:08:46,240 --> 02:08:47,680
I'm so fucked up right now.

3059
02:08:48,380 --> 02:08:50,160
Guys, does this look like a person?

3060
02:08:50,160 --> 02:08:51,380
That's doing okay?

3061
02:08:56,260 --> 02:08:58,520
Do it for us.

I'm so ready.

3067
02:09:10,280 --> 02:09:11,220
Is it here?

3068
02:09:15,220 --> 02:09:16,280
Oh, shit.

3069
02:09:16,460 --> 02:09:18,140
Okay, we're not supposed to be here.

3070
02:09:18,540 --> 02:09:19,000
We're...

3071
02:09:22,100 --> 02:09:22,620
Okay, no.

3072
02:09:22,720 --> 02:09:23,200
He can...

3073
02:09:23,200 --> 02:09:24,100
He can stay there.

3074
02:09:24,340 --> 02:09:24,700
I...

3075
02:09:24,700 --> 02:09:24,940
Fuck you.

3076
02:09:24,980 --> 02:09:25,740
I'm not dealing with that.

3077
02:09:27,060 --> 02:09:28,300
Anyone appraise this yet?

3078
02:09:28,640 --> 02:09:29,360
Come on, please.

3079
02:09:38,220 --> 02:09:39,100
Oh, my God.

3080
02:09:39,260 --> 02:09:39,320
Oh, my God.

3081
02:09:39,320 --> 02:09:40,360
I don't have my horse.

3082
02:09:42,520 --> 02:09:43,760
Guys, my horse.

3083
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:44,680

3087
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:51,020
I have so much money, guys.

3088
02:09:51,040 --> 02:09:53,180
You don't want me to get robbed in Crime City.

3089
02:09:53,700 --> 02:09:54,480
Guys, I...

3090
02:09:54,480 --> 02:09:58,460
Please, I don't want to get robbed in Crime Alley, guys.

3091
02:10:02,400 --> 02:10:06,720
Oh, there's a healing gem in my inventory.

3092
02:10:06,840 --> 02:10:07,480
Okay, I believe.

3093
02:10:08,140 --> 02:10:09,460
Okay, I figured it out.

3094
02:10:10,020 --> 02:10:11,280

Okay, what does it look like?

3099
02:10:23,040 --> 02:10:24,700
What does it look like?

3100
02:10:29,410 --> 02:10:30,430
Where is it?

3101
02:10:33,050 --> 02:10:33,990
A gem.

3102
02:10:34,190 --> 02:10:35,410
It looks like a gem.

3103
02:10:35,810 --> 02:10:36,290
That's okay.

3104
02:10:39,210 --> 02:10:39,810
Thank you.

3105
02:10:41,270 --> 02:10:42,750
Okay, is it this?

3106
02:10:44,370 --> 02:10:45,990
What else could it look like?

3107
02:10:52,840 --> 02:10:53,900
Is it this?

3108
02:10:54,440 --> 02:10:55,560
How do I use it?

3109
02:10:57,200 --> 02:10:59,060
Oh my god, I have no mana.

3110
02:11:03,910 --> 02:11:05,490
Oh my god, I don't have it.

3111
02:11:06,210 --> 02:11:08,070
I don't have mana for this.

3112
02:11:08,290 --> 02:11:09,050
I am...

3113
02:11:13,250 --> 02:11:14,350
Okay, it's fine.

3114
02:11:14,650 --> 02:11:16,110
We can run past this.

3115
02:11:16,450 --> 02:11:17,610
Guys, I just...

3116
02:11:17,610 --> 02:11:18,290
Guys, come on.

3117
02:11:18,430 --> 02:11:18,950
I just...

3118
02:11:18,950 --> 02:11:19,770
One of you...

3119
02:11:19,770 --> 02:11:21,070
Guys, I will give you a shout-out.

3120
02:11:23,150 --> 02:11:24,030
I will...

3121
02:11:24,030 --> 02:11:25,750
Guys, I will give you a shout-out.

3122
02:11:25,750 --> 02:11:27,410
If I get one message appraised.

3123
02:11:27,550 --> 02:11:27,990
Come on.

3124
02:11:28,190 --> 02:11:28,650
Come on.

3125
02:11:28,710 --> 02:11:29,070
Just one.

3126
02:11:29,510 --> 02:11:29,950
Just one.

3127
02:11:33,730 --> 02:11:34,350
I'm okay.

3128
02:11:34,970 --> 02:11:36,030
Oh my god.

3129
02:11:36,230 --> 02:11:37,890
Guys, I think he's gonna fucking kill me.

3130
02:11:38,710 --> 02:11:39,350
Oh!

3131
02:11:39,710 --> 02:11:40,350
Oh!

3132
02:11:43,130 --> 02:11:43,770
Holy shit.

3133
02:11:44,170 --> 02:11:45,250
Holy shit.

3134
02:11:45,550 --> 02:11:46,830
Oh my god.

3135
02:11:47,130 --> 02:11:48,930
I do not deserve that.

3136
02:11:49,690 --> 02:11:50,010
Oh!

3137
02:11:50,570 --> 02:11:51,490
My god!

3138
02:11:51,750 --> 02:11:52,630
I don't need you!

3139
02:11:52,850 --> 02:11:53,930
I don't need you!

3140
02:11:54,070 --> 02:11:54,490
I'm kidding!

3141
02:11:54,490 --> 02:11:54,750
I'm screaming!

3142
02:11:57,550 --> 02:11:59,410
That's fucking right!

3143
02:12:00,030 --> 02:12:01,250
That's right message.

3144
02:12:01,450 --> 02:12:02,090
I praise the...

3145
02:12:02,090 --> 02:12:02,430
Hello.

3146
02:12:04,330 --> 02:12:08,990
My utmost thanks for bringing me to the base of the earth.

3147
02:12:09,510 --> 02:12:10,110
There we go.

3148
02:12:10,150 --> 02:12:11,010
I did it.

3149
02:12:11,870 --> 02:12:12,550
That's...

3150
02:12:12,550 --> 02:12:13,490
I keep right message.

3151
02:12:13,490 --> 02:12:14,530
I praise this!

3152
02:12:18,870 --> 02:12:19,430
I...

3153
02:12:19,810 --> 02:12:20,090
Wait.

3154
02:12:21,770 --> 02:12:23,470
Who will upgrade my stuff?

3155
02:12:23,990 --> 02:12:24,270
Farewell.

3156
02:12:24,770 --> 02:12:26,150
I shall leave Torrent.

3157
02:12:27,270 --> 02:12:29,990
And the power to turn runes into strength.

3158
02:12:30,890 --> 02:12:31,850
Oh, thank god.

3159
02:12:31,850 --> 02:12:34,250
I was gonna say, who the fuck is gonna upgrade?

3160
02:12:38,370 --> 02:12:38,930
Ungrateful.

3161
02:12:40,090 --> 02:12:40,890
No, wait.

3162
02:12:41,010 --> 02:12:41,670
Don't leave me!

3163
02:12:41,670 --> 02:12:45,210
No doubt, you will become Elden Lord.

3164
02:12:46,290 --> 02:12:48,010
May you take the throne.

3165
02:12:48,990 --> 02:12:50,450
Oh, hey, Maxxer.

3166
02:12:50,930 --> 02:12:52,950
Johnny, thank you in the super chat.

3167
02:12:53,090 --> 02:12:54,150
Thank you, thank you.

3168
02:12:54,710 --> 02:12:55,410
What is...

3169
02:12:55,410 --> 02:12:56,450
What is that?

3170
02:12:56,750 --> 02:12:57,870
Anyway, where...

3171
02:12:58,830 --> 02:12:59,430
Where...

3172
02:12:59,430 --> 02:13:00,770
Where is she from?

3173
02:13:01,070 --> 02:13:01,890
Ashes of War?

3174
02:13:02,070 --> 02:13:02,350
No.

3175
02:13:04,390 --> 02:13:05,410
I don't even know what...

3176
02:13:05,410 --> 02:13:06,650
What did you do?

3177
02:13:10,010 --> 02:13:11,450
What did you do?

3178
02:13:11,670 --> 02:13:12,770
I don't even remember.

3179
02:13:13,330 --> 02:13:13,730
I...

3180
02:13:16,530 --> 02:13:17,970
She's gone, bro.

3181
02:13:18,870 --> 02:13:19,350
Oh, shit.

3182
02:13:19,490 --> 02:13:20,090
Okay, here we go.

3183
02:13:20,430 --> 02:13:22,270
Oh, was she the one that leveled me up?

3184
02:13:22,350 --> 02:13:22,650
Okay.

3185
02:13:23,070 --> 02:13:24,930
Okay, clearly I was...

3186
02:13:25,350 --> 02:13:27,850
Sorry, I had too many Maidens that it was hard to keep track.

3187
02:13:29,170 --> 02:13:29,570
Core.

3188
02:13:31,350 --> 02:13:31,750
Alright.

3189
02:13:35,540 --> 02:13:40,960
No, guys, I just had too many Maidens that it was so hard to keep track, guys.

3190
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:43,240
Of, like, which...

3191
02:13:43,240 --> 02:13:44,040
What she did.

3192
02:13:45,520 --> 02:13:46,460
Oh, my God.

3193
02:13:49,420 --> 02:13:50,020
Jesus.

3194
02:13:50,280 --> 02:13:50,560
Okay.

3195
02:13:51,300 --> 02:13:52,480
Okay, we're fine.

3196
02:13:53,180 --> 02:13:54,620
Let's just sneak up.

3197
02:13:55,520 --> 02:13:56,580
They won't know.

3198
02:14:02,740 --> 02:14:03,340
Oh,

3199
02:14:07,490 --> 02:14:08,090
fuck!

3200
02:14:08,470 --> 02:14:09,810
I didn't mean that!

3201
02:14:10,090 --> 02:14:11,350
Oh, shit!

3202
02:14:11,750 --> 02:14:12,250
Okay.

3203
02:14:13,070 --> 02:14:14,230
Okay, I'm okay.

3204
02:14:14,470 --> 02:14:15,350
I'm okay.

3205
02:14:15,630 --> 02:14:16,390
I'm okay.

3206
02:14:18,050 --> 02:14:18,770
I'm okay.

3207
02:14:18,770 --> 02:14:18,830
I'm...

3208
02:14:18,830 --> 02:14:19,790
I'm okay, guys.

3209
02:14:20,950 --> 02:14:21,550
I'm...

3210
02:14:23,310 --> 02:14:24,470
Oh, fuck!

3211
02:14:24,990 --> 02:14:25,770
Oh, shit!

3212
02:14:26,170 --> 02:14:26,890
Oh, shit!

3213
02:14:27,190 --> 02:14:27,690
I don't...

3214
02:14:27,690 --> 02:14:28,790
Guys, I don't...

3215
02:14:28,790 --> 02:14:31,010
I don't think I'm getting any message of praise, aren't I?

3216
02:14:31,010 --> 02:14:31,030
I...

3217
02:14:33,750 --> 02:14:35,030
I'm so serious.

3218
02:14:35,350 --> 02:14:38,130
I have a feeling that...

3219
02:14:38,130 --> 02:14:41,570
Maybe my drag wounds aren't gonna praise me anymore.

3220
02:14:42,090 --> 02:14:42,470
I...

3221
02:14:43,870 --> 02:14:45,030
Oh, my God.

3222
02:14:45,130 --> 02:14:45,810
I'm dead!

3223
02:14:46,310 --> 02:14:48,490
What do you want from me?

3224
02:14:49,830 --> 02:14:52,730
You said you didn't need it.

3225
02:14:53,730 --> 02:14:55,950
Guys, guys, I was joking.

3226
02:14:56,170 --> 02:14:56,630
It was...

3227
02:14:56,630 --> 02:14:58,870
It was for content, guys.

3228
02:14:59,170 --> 02:15:00,730
Come on, come on, come on.

3229
02:15:00,730 --> 02:15:01,250
God, you...

3230
02:15:01,250 --> 02:15:02,230
You know you wanted to...

3231
02:15:02,230 --> 02:15:02,950
Oh, look at that.

3232
02:15:03,270 --> 02:15:03,970
Thank you.

3233
02:15:04,130 --> 02:15:05,590
Thank you for the...

3234
02:15:05,590 --> 02:15:06,730
Message of praise, chat.

3235
02:15:06,990 --> 02:15:09,070
I really appreciate that.

3236
02:15:10,570 --> 02:15:11,870
Thank you, guys.

3237
02:15:13,930 --> 02:15:15,830
This is for content.

3238
02:15:23,130 --> 02:15:23,950
Oh, fuck.

3239
02:15:24,170 --> 02:15:24,570
What?

3240
02:15:25,030 --> 02:15:25,750
That's awkward.

3241
02:15:27,050 --> 02:15:27,850
That's awkward.

3242
02:15:30,730 --> 02:15:31,530
Union rules.

3243
02:15:32,070 --> 02:15:32,470
Sorry.

3244
02:15:33,170 --> 02:15:35,690
Papa, sir, thank you for the super chat.

3245
02:15:35,850 --> 02:15:36,710
Thank you, thank you.

3246
02:15:37,050 --> 02:15:38,410
Sir, thank you for the super chat.

3247
02:15:38,570 --> 02:15:39,290
Thank you, thank you.

3248
02:15:39,370 --> 02:15:39,770
Does he know?

3249
02:15:39,950 --> 02:15:40,470
Oh, he knows.

3250
02:15:46,310 --> 02:15:47,890
Okay, but I have the high ground.

3251
02:15:47,890 --> 02:15:47,990
Come on.

3252
02:15:51,920 --> 02:15:52,380
Yeah.

3253
02:15:52,680 --> 02:15:53,540
What was he gonna do?

3254
02:15:53,700 --> 02:15:55,040
I literally have the high ground.

3255
02:15:56,840 --> 02:15:57,480
That's right.

3256
02:15:57,640 --> 02:15:58,520
Challenge me.

3257
02:15:59,760 --> 02:16:00,500
That's right.

3258
02:16:03,340 --> 02:16:03,960
That's right.

3259
02:16:04,040 --> 02:16:04,920
Are you scared?

3260
02:16:05,420 --> 02:16:06,880
Oh, you're scared.

3261
02:16:07,060 --> 02:16:07,720
I fucking knew it.

3262
02:16:07,960 --> 02:16:08,420
Wait.

3263
02:16:08,780 --> 02:16:08,920
Wait.

3264
02:16:09,020 --> 02:16:10,060
I figured it out.

3265
02:16:10,280 --> 02:16:10,740
Watch this.

3266
02:16:13,800 --> 02:16:15,280
Okay, I hope that doesn't hit me.

3267
02:16:20,090 --> 02:16:20,930
That's right.

3268
02:16:21,190 --> 02:16:22,410
I didn't watch this.

3269
02:16:25,070 --> 02:16:25,810
That's right.

3270
02:16:26,050 --> 02:16:26,490
Come on.

3271
02:16:27,290 --> 02:16:28,230
Challenge me.

3272
02:16:29,070 --> 02:16:31,730
I have the high ground yet again.

3273
02:16:32,210 --> 02:16:34,010
You don't know how to walk up...

3274
02:16:34,010 --> 02:16:34,910
Oh, he's...

3275
02:16:34,910 --> 02:16:34,990
Oh.

3276
02:16:35,990 --> 02:16:37,210
You don't know how to walk upstairs.

3277
02:16:37,650 --> 02:16:38,550
That's right.

3278
02:16:39,030 --> 02:16:40,250
What you gonna do?

3279
02:16:40,650 --> 02:16:41,230
Oh, shit.

3280
02:16:41,450 --> 02:16:42,010
Oh, shit.

3281
02:16:42,010 --> 02:16:43,610
He's walking up the stairs even more.

3282
02:16:44,110 --> 02:16:45,030
Oh, fuck.

3283
02:16:45,370 --> 02:16:45,510
Okay.

3284
02:16:46,010 --> 02:16:46,830
That's right.

3285
02:16:49,850 --> 02:16:50,450
Oh, my God.

3286
02:16:50,530 --> 02:16:51,010
He's up here.

3287
02:16:51,250 --> 02:16:51,870
Oh, my God.

3288
02:16:51,970 --> 02:16:52,830
I didn't think this far.

3289
02:16:53,250 --> 02:16:53,610
I...

3290
02:16:56,190 --> 02:16:56,550
Guys.

3291
02:16:56,770 --> 02:16:57,590
I didn't think this far.

3292
02:16:57,710 --> 02:16:58,770
I didn't think he'd come up here.

3293
02:17:00,730 --> 02:17:01,530
Oh, my God.

3294
02:17:01,690 --> 02:17:02,730
I didn't think he'd come up here.

3295
02:17:03,190 --> 02:17:03,410
Guys.

3296
02:17:04,050 --> 02:17:04,410
I...

3297
02:17:05,470 --> 02:17:06,390
Why is he here?

3298
02:17:07,270 --> 02:17:08,310
Why is he here?

3299
02:17:09,270 --> 02:17:10,090
Oh, my God.

3300
02:17:10,270 --> 02:17:11,090
Why are you here?

3301
02:17:11,430 --> 02:17:12,270
Oh, fuck.

3302
02:17:12,270 --> 02:17:16,830
Oh my god.

3303
02:17:18,350 --> 02:17:19,970
Oh my god, I thought he turned around.

3304
02:17:20,090 --> 02:17:21,250
That was like my entire plan.

3305
02:17:21,710 --> 02:17:28,210
That was like... I thought he... he turned around!

3306
02:17:28,670 --> 02:17:30,610
He did that the first time!

3307
02:17:35,950 --> 02:17:37,330
He killed you.

3308
02:17:37,570 --> 02:17:39,630
I thought he would turn around!

3309
02:17:40,450 --> 02:17:41,350
Okay, okay.

3310
02:17:41,430 --> 02:17:42,270
I figured it out.

3311
02:17:43,510 --> 02:17:46,250
He spared you the first time.

3312
02:17:47,170 --> 02:17:48,330
I don't understand.

3313
02:17:48,810 --> 02:17:50,330
Why didn't he turn around?

3314
02:17:54,800 --> 02:17:56,900
He is no coward.

3315
02:17:59,360 --> 02:17:59,920
Okay.

3316
02:18:00,280 --> 02:18:01,120
I got it.

3317
02:18:01,580 --> 02:18:02,460
And then he'll do it the second.

3318
02:18:02,740 --> 02:18:03,780
He'll turn around the second.

3319
02:18:03,780 --> 02:18:04,680
He he he.

3320
02:18:04,980 --> 02:18:06,160
He he he.

3321
02:18:06,160 --> 02:18:06,700
He he.

3322
02:18:08,540 --> 02:18:09,220
That's right.

3323
02:18:09,680 --> 02:18:10,240
He he he he.

3324
02:18:10,460 --> 02:18:12,020
Don't you ever learn.

3325
02:18:12,640 --> 02:18:13,080
Raxi.

3326
02:18:13,260 --> 02:18:14,360
Thank you for the super chat.

3327
02:18:14,520 --> 02:18:14,760
Thank you.

3328
02:18:14,840 --> 02:18:15,080
Thank you.

3329
02:18:15,140 --> 02:18:15,680
Okay, now.

3330
02:18:16,800 --> 02:18:18,500
Now I'm out of the high ground.

3331
02:18:20,080 --> 02:18:21,100
Is he coming over?

3332
02:18:24,040 --> 02:18:24,760
I'm out of the high ground.

3333
02:18:28,200 --> 02:18:28,920
I'm out of the high ground.

3334
02:18:28,920 --> 02:18:29,300
He he he.

3335
02:18:31,500 --> 02:18:32,440
Ahh-ha!

3336
02:18:34,620 --> 02:18:35,620
That's right!

3337
02:18:35,980 --> 02:18:38,040
Oh fuck!

3338
02:18:39,100 --> 02:18:39,820
Oh shit!

3339
02:18:40,180 --> 02:18:40,700
Oh shit!

3340
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:41,360
Oh shit!

3341
02:18:42,740 --> 02:18:43,960
Guys I didn't hit it.

3342
02:18:44,180 --> 02:18:44,300
Okay.

3343
02:18:44,300 --> 02:18:44,300
Okay.

3344
02:18:55,330 --> 02:18:56,710
Like, he knows.

3345
02:18:59,270 --> 02:19:01,150
Guess he doesn't see me.

3346
02:19:02,070 --> 02:19:08,610
All according to... All according to... He doesn't know.

3347
02:19:10,730 --> 02:19:12,390
Forget about me, right?

3348
02:19:16,530 --> 02:19:17,530
Alright.

3349
02:19:22,540 --> 02:19:24,400
Alright, round three.

3350
02:19:28,840 --> 02:19:29,560
Oh!

3351
02:19:29,560 --> 02:19:30,640
Holy shit!

3352
02:19:31,180 --> 02:19:32,380
He bit him!

3353
02:19:32,500 --> 02:19:33,580
He's shame on me!

3354
02:19:36,780 --> 02:19:38,380
Fooled me twice!

3355
02:19:38,920 --> 02:19:40,840
Oh my god, he's actually running!

3356
02:19:42,480 --> 02:19:45,160
Holy... He did not forget.

3357
02:19:46,360 --> 02:19:48,360
Oh my god, he actually ran.

3358
02:19:48,680 --> 02:19:50,040
He could tell.

3359
02:19:50,640 --> 02:19:53,140
He cut the eye out his nose.

3360
02:19:55,880 --> 02:19:58,340
It's okay if Crouch, he'll turn around.

3361
02:19:59,080 --> 02:20:04,500
Oh my god, he's actually... He's slowly backing up with his shield out!

3362
02:20:05,020 --> 02:20:05,120
Oh!

3363
02:20:08,130 --> 02:20:09,110
I'm getting closer!

3364
02:20:09,610 --> 02:20:10,870
Oh my god!

3365
02:20:13,390 --> 02:20:14,250
What?

3366
02:20:14,510 --> 02:20:17,650
What do you mean they can learn this much?

3367
02:20:18,230 --> 02:20:20,010
Oh my god!

3368
02:20:21,510 --> 02:20:22,890
Bro, that's fucked up.

3369
02:20:22,890 --> 02:20:27,610
That's actually... That's actually... That's actually fucked up, buddy.

3370
02:20:32,090 --> 02:20:32,970
Okay.

3371
02:20:32,970 --> 02:20:34,490
Clever boy.

3372
02:20:35,270 --> 02:20:38,030
I... I... Nobody told me they can actually learn!

3373
02:20:41,130 --> 02:20:42,530
Oh my god!

3374
02:20:42,850 --> 02:20:44,250
Oh my god!

3375
02:20:44,470 --> 02:20:45,110
Oh my god!

3376
02:20:45,110 --> 02:20:46,470
Oh my god!

3377
02:20:46,470 --> 02:20:48,250
Oh my god!

3378
02:20:48,790 --> 02:20:50,830
Oh my god!

3379
02:20:51,990 --> 02:20:53,050
Oh my god!

3380
02:20:54,050 --> 02:21:01,490
Oh my god!

3381
02:21:01,970 --> 02:21:03,930
Oh my god!

3382
02:21:04,070 --> 02:21:04,830
Oh my god!

3383
02:21:04,930 --> 02:21:05,310
I'm stuck!

3384
02:21:05,610 --> 02:21:06,310
I'm stuck!

3385
02:21:06,590 --> 02:21:07,330
Oh my god!

3386
02:21:07,530 --> 02:21:08,010
He got it!

3387
02:21:08,010 --> 02:21:08,570
He got me stuck!

3388
02:21:21,720 --> 02:21:23,860
He got me stuck!

3389
02:21:25,180 --> 02:21:26,620
Okay, we're getting out of here.

3390
02:21:26,720 --> 02:21:27,920
I'm not fighting them anymore.

3391
02:21:28,600 --> 02:21:28,740
Okay.

3392
02:21:29,360 --> 02:21:29,880
Alright.

3393
02:21:30,340 --> 02:21:31,140
They won.

3394
02:21:33,420 --> 02:21:34,240
They've won.

3395
02:21:34,720 --> 02:21:35,340
I'm not fighting.

3396
02:21:35,380 --> 02:21:35,620
Okay.

3397
02:21:36,020 --> 02:21:37,820
I'll do one last backstab on that guy.

3398
02:21:38,680 --> 02:21:40,680
I didn't think I'd be stuck!

3399
02:21:40,880 --> 02:21:43,760
I didn't heal because I thought I'd be okay.

3400
02:21:44,600 --> 02:21:45,720
Okay, I'll do this.

3401
02:21:47,060 --> 02:21:48,240
Grab this!

3402
02:21:48,440 --> 02:21:49,200
And then leave.

3403
02:21:52,380 --> 02:21:52,980
Okay.

3404
02:21:53,640 --> 02:21:54,300
Here we go.

3405
02:21:54,860 --> 02:21:55,480
We're fine now.

3406
02:21:56,160 --> 02:21:56,620
Oh, thank you.

3407
02:21:56,820 --> 02:21:58,840
Thank you for the message of praise.

3408
02:21:59,520 --> 02:22:00,200
Thank you guys.

3409
02:22:01,160 --> 02:22:01,460
Alright.

3410
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:03,340
I've learned my lesson.

3411
02:22:03,820 --> 02:22:05,560
I'm not going through that guy.

3412
02:22:11,070 --> 02:22:12,350
I've learned my lesson.

3413
02:22:12,570 --> 02:22:13,610
I'm not doing that.

3414
02:22:14,290 --> 02:22:15,870
I didn't hit you.

3415
02:22:18,170 --> 02:22:18,990
They've won.

3416
02:22:19,230 --> 02:22:20,610
I'm not going through that.

3417
02:22:21,550 --> 02:22:22,570
Precious item ahead?

3418
02:22:22,870 --> 02:22:23,150
Oh.

3419
02:22:23,790 --> 02:22:24,530
We need that.

3420
02:22:27,490 --> 02:22:28,490
What's over here?

3421
02:22:29,330 --> 02:22:31,010
No secret passage.

3422
02:22:31,190 --> 02:22:31,290
Okay.

3423
02:22:32,690 --> 02:22:33,750
That's not the way.

3424
02:22:34,310 --> 02:22:34,670
Oh, hey!

3425
02:22:34,710 --> 02:22:35,430
There's the dragon!

3426
02:22:35,910 --> 02:22:36,890
There he is.

3427
02:22:38,010 --> 02:22:39,350
And where is Zoe?

3428
02:22:41,150 --> 02:22:42,310
Try jumping?

3429
02:22:43,250 --> 02:22:43,610
Okay.

3430
02:22:43,970 --> 02:22:44,230
No.

3431
02:22:45,590 --> 02:22:46,310
No.

3432
02:22:46,510 --> 02:22:46,990
Not here.

3433
02:22:51,720 --> 02:22:52,800
Maybe like...

3434
02:22:53,160 --> 02:22:54,240
There's a ladder here.

3435
02:22:56,460 --> 02:22:57,540
Snakes and ladders?

3436
02:22:57,820 --> 02:22:58,260
Anton!

3437
02:22:58,540 --> 02:22:59,420
Thank you for the super...

3438
02:22:59,420 --> 02:23:00,620
Uh, thank you for the one gifted ship.

3439
02:23:00,760 --> 02:23:01,640
Thank you, thank you.

3440
02:23:17,420 --> 02:23:18,100
I'm sorry.

3441
02:23:23,910 --> 02:23:26,270
I feel like that's a fair reaction, guys.

3442
02:23:30,910 --> 02:23:32,350
Oh, I'm calling the dragon?

3443
02:23:32,670 --> 02:23:32,930
Nice.

3444
02:23:32,930 --> 02:23:34,570
Is he dead or is he sleeping?

3445
02:23:39,280 --> 02:23:39,800
Alright.

3446
02:23:42,020 --> 02:23:43,020
I can't tell.

3447
02:23:44,060 --> 02:23:44,880
He dead?

3448
02:23:45,360 --> 02:23:47,680
Why don't they just get rid of this dragon?

3449
02:23:48,440 --> 02:23:49,680
What's he doing here?

3450
02:23:52,860 --> 02:23:54,720
How do I get out of here?

3451
02:23:54,960 --> 02:23:56,100
Oh, he's petrified.

3452
02:23:56,240 --> 02:23:56,880
Yeah, I was gonna say.

3453
02:23:57,160 --> 02:23:59,940
How do you just remove a dragon from all of this?

3454
02:24:03,360 --> 02:24:04,140
I guess here?

3455
02:24:07,080 --> 02:24:07,880
Oh, nice.

3456
02:24:09,920 --> 02:24:10,780
I don't know.

3457
02:24:10,920 --> 02:24:13,600
You can just, like, start cutting it into pieces.

3458
02:24:15,660 --> 02:24:16,640
That's a neat thing.

3459
02:24:16,860 --> 02:24:17,680
You don't.

3460
02:24:20,100 --> 02:24:21,340
You wear a strong flow.

3461
02:24:21,540 --> 02:24:22,400
First off, well done.

3462
02:24:22,540 --> 02:24:23,120
I didn't!

3463
02:24:24,980 --> 02:24:25,460
Huh?

3464
02:24:26,380 --> 02:24:27,260
Oh my god, no.

3465
02:24:27,260 --> 02:24:27,320
No.

3466
02:24:28,800 --> 02:24:30,400
No, not these guys again.

3467
02:24:44,570 --> 02:24:45,490
Oh my god.

3468
02:24:45,630 --> 02:24:46,350
Just stab him.

3469
02:24:48,730 --> 02:24:49,810
I just...

3470
02:24:52,330 --> 02:24:53,890
No, I shouldn't.

3471
02:24:53,910 --> 02:24:55,030
I shouldn't test my luck.

3472
02:24:56,770 --> 02:24:57,850
Look at the fact.

3473
02:24:59,420 --> 02:25:01,840
I don't trust you guys to save me anymore.

3474
02:25:06,630 --> 02:25:08,780
I may or may not have...

3475
02:25:09,410 --> 02:25:11,130
I might have, like...

3476
02:25:11,130 --> 02:25:12,230
Oh wait, did he hear me?

3477
02:25:12,350 --> 02:25:12,810
Oh shit!

3478
02:25:13,230 --> 02:25:13,710
Oh shit!

3479
02:25:19,370 --> 02:25:21,710
I don't think you guys will save me.

3480
02:25:22,070 --> 02:25:24,190
You'll let me die to teach me a lesson.

3481
02:25:32,440 --> 02:25:32,880
Okay.

3482
02:25:33,360 --> 02:25:33,880
What does it say?

3483
02:25:33,920 --> 02:25:34,800
I wanna read your message.

3484
02:25:34,980 --> 02:25:35,300
You're stupid.

3485
02:25:35,460 --> 02:25:37,300
I wanna read your fucking stupid message.

3486
02:25:37,620 --> 02:25:38,540
I'm curious.

3487
02:25:39,460 --> 02:25:40,820
Goddammit, I'm not that curious.

3488
02:25:44,740 --> 02:25:45,920
Okay, she doesn't trust us.

3489
02:25:46,020 --> 02:25:46,180
Okay.

3490
02:25:46,600 --> 02:25:47,600
I swear to god.

3491
02:25:48,020 --> 02:25:48,360
Alright.

3492
02:25:48,700 --> 02:25:50,180
I swear, I swear to god.

3493
02:25:50,360 --> 02:25:51,240
I'll fight him.

3494
02:25:51,440 --> 02:25:52,200
But I swear to god.

3495
02:25:52,540 --> 02:25:53,980
Oh shit, he did...

3496
02:25:56,340 --> 02:25:58,760
I can't believe it worked a second time.

3497
02:25:59,340 --> 02:25:59,840
Me too.

3498
02:26:02,340 --> 02:26:02,840
Alright.

3499
02:26:02,960 --> 02:26:03,460
Alright.

3500
02:26:03,700 --> 02:26:03,720
Alright.

3501
02:26:03,720 --> 02:26:05,020
Am I gonna get help?

3502
02:26:06,080 --> 02:26:06,580
Dragoons?

3503
02:26:07,060 --> 02:26:07,540
Am I...

3504
02:26:07,540 --> 02:26:09,140
Guys, am I gonna get help?

3505
02:26:09,360 --> 02:26:09,600
Huh?

3506
02:26:09,800 --> 02:26:10,580
Am I...

3507
02:26:10,580 --> 02:26:11,200
Alright.

3508
02:26:11,420 --> 02:26:12,440
Time to find out.

3509
02:26:13,400 --> 02:26:14,600
Will I get help?

3510
02:26:14,600 --> 02:26:16,100
Come on.

3511
02:26:22,710 --> 02:26:23,490
Come on!

3512
02:26:23,490 --> 02:26:23,750
Alright!

3513
02:26:23,910 --> 02:26:24,410

3521
02:26:31,710 --> 02:26:32,370
The message apprais.

3522
02:26:35,650 --> 02:26:36,170

3523
02:26:36,430 --> 02:26:36,650

3524
02:26:37,090 --> 02:26:37,350

3525
02:26:37,470 --> 02:26:38,230
He's stabbing me!

3526
02:26:38,410 --> 02:26:39,850
He's stabbing me guys!

3527
02:26:40,770 --> 02:26:41,290
He....

3528
02:26:41,290 --> 02:26:41,950
Okay!

3529
02:26:42,450 --> 02:26:43,910
He's still stabbing me!

3530
02:26:44,470 --> 02:26:44,990
Guys!

3531
02:26:47,430 --> 02:26:49,450
Oh my god, he does it twice now?

3532
02:26:53,230 --> 02:26:54,130
Oh my god.

3533
02:26:56,390 --> 02:26:56,910
No!

3534
02:26:57,630 --> 02:26:58,150
No!

3535
02:27:07,840 --> 02:27:08,360
Oh,

3536
02:27:16,080 --> 02:27:17,060
yeah, yeah, greed.

3537
02:27:17,480 --> 02:27:18,660
Yeah, yeah, greed.

3538
02:27:18,960 --> 02:27:19,660
That was it.

3539
02:27:19,760 --> 02:27:23,540
Guys, that was... that was the issue.

3540
02:27:24,120 --> 02:27:25,640
Yeah, okay.

3541
02:27:26,540 --> 02:27:28,740
Message was a break.

3542
02:27:31,500 --> 02:27:34,700
Alright, let's grab this and leave.

3543
02:27:36,520 --> 02:27:39,320
Your greed sickens me.

3544
02:27:40,380 --> 02:27:41,540
You're dead.

3545
02:27:41,840 --> 02:27:43,640
No, not big surprise.

3546
02:27:44,220 --> 02:27:45,980
Raksha, thank you for the super chat.

3547
02:27:46,100 --> 02:27:46,920
Thank you, thank you.

3548
02:27:46,920 --> 02:27:47,780
Nervous.

3549
02:27:47,900 --> 02:27:48,740
Thank you for the super chat.

3550
02:27:48,840 --> 02:27:49,780
Thank you, thank you.

3551
02:27:50,520 --> 02:27:50,880
Oh.

3552
02:27:51,580 --> 02:27:53,380
Oh, they're like mourning something.

3553
02:27:56,160 --> 02:27:57,320
So there's speed.

3554
02:27:59,000 --> 02:27:59,560
Blocking.

3555
02:28:00,420 --> 02:28:02,180
Thanks for all the laughs and smiles.

3556
02:28:03,380 --> 02:28:04,880
Is this precious item ahead?

3557
02:28:05,180 --> 02:28:06,020
Oh, there it is.

3558
02:28:07,480 --> 02:28:09,340
Do you have a favorite candy?

3559
02:28:09,880 --> 02:28:11,080
Oh, Lindit chocolates.

3560
02:28:11,560 --> 02:28:12,480
I love Lindit.

3561
02:28:13,100 --> 02:28:14,240
The chocolates.

3562
02:28:15,320 --> 02:28:15,940
Chocolate.

3563
02:28:15,940 --> 02:28:16,580
Latte.

3564
02:28:18,300 --> 02:28:18,900
Oh.

3565
02:28:19,560 --> 02:28:20,800
Oh, da da pom pom.

3566
02:28:21,140 --> 02:28:22,280
Chocolate misto.

3567
02:28:22,600 --> 02:28:23,000
Pa da dum.

3568
02:28:23,300 --> 02:28:23,980
Pam pum.

3569
02:28:24,500 --> 02:28:25,400
Pa da dum.

3570
02:28:25,720 --> 02:28:26,040
Hi.

3571
02:28:33,100 --> 02:28:34,360
But those are my favorite.

3572
02:28:35,180 --> 02:28:35,940
Down ahead.

3573
02:28:36,140 --> 02:28:37,060
But first off... Lever?

3574
02:28:38,200 --> 02:28:40,220
Get it out of my head!

3575
02:28:40,940 --> 02:28:41,920
Where's the lever?

3576
02:28:43,540 --> 02:28:45,240
You said there was a lever here.

3577
02:28:51,540 --> 02:28:52,020
Where?

3578
02:28:52,120 --> 02:28:53,080
The fuck is this lever?

3579
02:28:59,180 --> 02:29:00,040
Am I blind?

3580
02:29:02,560 --> 02:29:05,120
Where is this man po- Oh my god, I am.

3581
02:29:05,480 --> 02:29:09,240
It's literally- Okay, that literally blended into the surroundings.

3582
02:29:09,380 --> 02:29:10,520
You can't blame me on that.

3583
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:12,180
A lever.

3584
02:29:13,840 --> 02:29:15,100
As I do though.

3585
02:29:19,940 --> 02:29:21,200
Where is this lever?

3586
02:29:21,380 --> 02:29:22,900
I don't know what this lever is doing.

3587
02:29:23,660 --> 02:29:25,200
Oh, it's this door!

3588
02:29:25,560 --> 02:29:25,840
Oh!

3589
02:29:25,840 --> 02:29:26,580
Oh!

3590
02:29:27,880 --> 02:29:29,580
Oh, okay, I can make this jump.

3591
02:29:33,910 --> 02:29:35,090
Actually, I don't think I can.

3592
02:29:42,120 --> 02:29:43,800
Okay, there's no red patches.

3593
02:29:44,680 --> 02:29:45,860
So I think I can.

3594
02:29:47,540 --> 02:29:48,840
Maybe if I'm full healed.

3595
02:29:49,480 --> 02:29:53,460
Maybe if I'm... Guys, how about we coordinate?

3596
02:29:53,560 --> 02:29:54,460
Okay, I got an idea.

3597
02:29:54,940 --> 02:29:58,780
When I hit the ground, we coordinate message appraises.

3598
02:29:59,220 --> 02:30:00,860
So, oh wait, I can just go for it.

3599
02:30:00,860 --> 02:30:01,200
From there.

3600
02:30:01,480 --> 02:30:01,640
Wait.

3601
02:30:02,380 --> 02:30:02,900
Okay, wait.

3602
02:30:03,040 --> 02:30:04,580
I can just go from there.

3603
02:30:05,180 --> 02:30:05,440
Okay.

3604
02:30:09,020 --> 02:30:10,320
Never mind, guys.

3605
02:30:10,780 --> 02:30:11,740
Never mind.

3606
02:30:11,760 --> 02:30:14,040
I can literally drop down from here.

3607
02:30:14,640 --> 02:30:15,240
Never mind.

3608
02:30:17,860 --> 02:30:18,920
There we go.

3609
02:30:19,120 --> 02:30:20,220
There we go.

3610
02:30:20,700 --> 02:30:21,740
There we go.

3611
02:30:22,500 --> 02:30:24,300
You almost got me.

3612
02:30:25,080 --> 02:30:27,540
You almost got me, guys.

3613
02:30:29,920 --> 02:30:31,480
You almost got me.

3614
02:30:31,720 --> 02:30:32,280
Look at you.

3615
02:30:32,440 --> 02:30:33,200
Look at me go.

3616
02:30:35,200 --> 02:30:36,180
First off, good luck.

3617
02:30:36,360 --> 02:30:37,020
And then try skill.

3618
02:30:37,200 --> 02:30:37,740
Grace ahead.

3619
02:30:38,060 --> 02:30:38,460
Seek right.

3620
02:30:38,640 --> 02:30:39,040
Oh, okay.

3621
02:30:42,860 --> 02:30:47,760
I don't like this bomb this way.

3622
02:30:49,800 --> 02:30:50,520
Where the fuck?

3623
02:30:50,640 --> 02:30:51,320
Oh, it's over here.

3624
02:30:57,670 --> 02:30:58,450
Oh, there it is.

3625
02:30:58,630 --> 02:31:00,910
Okay, I was gonna be like, where the fuck is this grace?

3626
02:31:05,580 --> 02:31:05,920
All right.

3627
02:31:07,560 --> 02:31:08,540
Okay, nice.

3628
02:31:09,240 --> 02:31:10,180
Made it pretty far.

3629
02:31:10,440 --> 02:31:10,940
What's this?

3630
02:31:11,380 --> 02:31:11,580
Oh.

3631
02:31:12,260 --> 02:31:13,060
Got another painting.

3632
02:31:13,340 --> 02:31:13,820
Let's go.

3633
02:31:19,890 --> 02:31:20,750
Notice what?

3634
02:31:31,500 --> 02:31:32,680
First off, good luck?

3635
02:31:33,040 --> 02:31:33,740
Notice what?

3636
02:31:36,340 --> 02:31:37,580
Now I notice it.

3637
02:31:37,640 --> 02:31:39,280
I just felt like something's gonna kill me.

3638
02:31:39,580 --> 02:31:40,740
If I take it.

3639
02:31:44,280 --> 02:31:45,080
Oh, shit.

3640
02:31:45,240 --> 02:31:45,480
Oh, shit.

3641
02:31:45,480 --> 02:31:45,520
Nice.

3642
02:31:46,700 --> 02:31:48,580
Wait, I get to take this for free?

3643
02:31:49,800 --> 02:31:50,720
Oh, shit.

3644
02:31:51,440 --> 02:31:51,900
Nice.

3645
02:31:52,060 --> 02:31:52,860
I like free stuff.

3646
02:31:53,460 --> 02:31:54,340
For free?

3647
02:32:01,620 --> 02:32:02,100
Nice.

3648
02:32:03,820 --> 02:32:04,740
Oh, my God.

3649
02:32:04,760 --> 02:32:06,780
I don't get punished for it, too?

3650
02:32:07,220 --> 02:32:09,560
Okay, I legitimately thought I was gonna fucking...

3651
02:32:09,560 --> 02:32:12,300
Something was gonna, like, come up and slap me or something.

3652
02:32:15,560 --> 02:32:16,340
That's nice.

3653
02:32:20,900 --> 02:32:22,040
I'm so paranoid.

3654
02:32:22,240 --> 02:32:23,200
Of course I'm paranoid.

3655
02:32:23,400 --> 02:32:23,980
It's Elden Ring.

3656
02:32:24,400 --> 02:32:25,800
It's a Souls game.

3657
02:32:29,920 --> 02:32:30,940
It's this way.

3658
02:32:33,600 --> 02:32:35,240
They're all out to get me.

3659
02:32:36,340 --> 02:32:37,600
I can feel it.

3660
02:32:46,680 --> 02:32:48,440
They all want a piece of me.

3661
02:32:49,520 --> 02:32:50,580
Oh, two fingers.

3662
02:32:50,920 --> 02:32:51,140
Nice.

3663
02:32:52,180 --> 02:32:54,240
Well, I'll never know what that message says.

3664
02:32:57,500 --> 02:32:58,340
Okay, nice.

3665
02:32:58,340 --> 02:32:59,620
What are you gonna do?

3666
02:32:59,780 --> 02:33:01,300
Fucking throw food at me, bro.

3667
02:33:01,860 --> 02:33:02,500
That's sad.

3668
02:33:03,720 --> 02:33:04,880
So sad.

3669
02:33:07,360 --> 02:33:09,740
Doki, they were just kitchen workers.

3670
02:33:09,940 --> 02:33:11,260
I can't believe it.

3671
02:33:11,560 --> 02:33:12,740
Killing the hell?

3672
02:33:13,080 --> 02:33:14,760
How far are you falling?

3673
02:33:16,040 --> 02:33:17,000
Only two?

3674
02:33:17,540 --> 02:33:19,480
Sometimes three is pretty good, too.

3675
02:33:22,960 --> 02:33:24,180
Ladder ahead?

3676
02:33:24,740 --> 02:33:25,480
I don't know.

3677
02:33:25,480 --> 02:33:25,880
Wait, there is?

3678
02:33:29,280 --> 02:33:30,640
Where is it?

3679
02:33:34,300 --> 02:33:35,000
Come on.

3680
02:33:35,260 --> 02:33:37,300
I am blind, but like...

3681
02:33:39,680 --> 02:33:40,560
Huh?

3682
02:33:47,890 --> 02:33:48,770
Huh?

3683
02:33:55,320 --> 02:33:57,340
You only had a friend.

3684
02:33:57,740 --> 02:33:59,160
Where is this message point?

3685
02:34:00,960 --> 02:34:02,340
Where you pointing to, sir?

3686
02:34:09,410 --> 02:34:10,950
Oh my god!

3687
02:34:12,970 --> 02:34:14,390
Oh, you fucker!

3688
02:34:14,850 --> 02:34:16,210
You... God!

3689
02:34:21,450 --> 02:34:23,850
No, you fucker.

3690
02:34:27,470 --> 02:34:28,690
So good.

3691
02:34:30,530 --> 02:34:31,970
That's so good.

3692
02:34:32,370 --> 02:34:33,810
Okay, I have...

3693
02:34:33,810 --> 02:34:34,570
Okay, you...

3694
02:34:34,570 --> 02:34:35,050
I...

3695
02:34:35,050 --> 02:34:37,270
I also gotta help out.

3696
02:34:37,650 --> 02:34:40,290
I have to help him out, too.

3697
02:34:41,090 --> 02:34:41,590
Okay.

3698
02:34:42,770 --> 02:34:44,430
Where the fuck is ladder?

3699
02:34:44,690 --> 02:34:44,850
Okay.

3700
02:34:52,750 --> 02:34:53,390
Wait!

3701
02:34:53,710 --> 02:34:54,350
Is that...

3702
02:34:54,350 --> 02:34:55,050
Oh, wait.

3703
02:34:55,250 --> 02:34:56,710
Okay, these are my appraisals.

3704
02:34:57,530 --> 02:34:58,170
I...

3705
02:34:58,170 --> 02:34:59,070
Look at that.

3706
02:35:00,670 --> 02:35:01,230
Look at that.

3707
02:35:01,230 --> 02:35:02,130
No porn messages.

3708
02:35:02,450 --> 02:35:03,270
Look at that, guys.

3709
02:35:03,590 --> 02:35:04,450
Okay, how do I...

3710
02:35:04,450 --> 02:35:06,170
How do I add, like...

3711
02:35:07,130 --> 02:35:07,410
Uh...

3712
02:35:07,690 --> 02:35:09,210
How do I add, like...

3713
02:35:09,210 --> 02:35:10,050
Um...

3714
02:35:10,050 --> 02:35:11,150
A...

3715
02:35:12,010 --> 02:35:12,930
Emote to it.

3716
02:35:13,050 --> 02:35:13,450
I forgot.

3717
02:35:13,790 --> 02:35:14,730
It's been so long.

3718
02:35:14,870 --> 02:35:15,470
I forgot.

3719
02:35:15,950 --> 02:35:16,050
It's been so long.

3720
02:35:16,050 --> 02:35:16,370
Is it Y?

3721
02:35:17,130 --> 02:35:17,850
Oh, okay.

3722
02:35:18,070 --> 02:35:18,290
Nice.

3723
02:35:22,590 --> 02:35:23,050
Alright.

3724
02:35:23,430 --> 02:35:24,830
I shall also help you out.

3725
02:35:24,830 --> 02:35:25,530
Alright.

3726
02:35:26,390 --> 02:35:26,510
Hahaha.

3727
02:35:28,810 --> 02:35:28,950
Hahaha.

3728
02:35:30,850 --> 02:35:30,970
Hahaha.

3729
02:35:41,150 --> 02:35:41,510
Okay.

3730
02:35:42,170 --> 02:35:43,210
Detour?

3731
02:35:46,150 --> 02:35:47,330
Enemy ahead?

3732
02:35:48,950 --> 02:35:50,390
Strong foe ahead?

3733
02:35:51,190 --> 02:35:51,910
Hello?

3734
02:35:53,150 --> 02:35:54,390
Oh, my God.

3735
02:35:54,530 --> 02:35:57,410
The fact that it slowly walked forward.

3736
02:35:57,770 --> 02:35:59,910
Oh, my God.

3737
02:36:00,590 --> 02:36:02,990
Oh, don't eat me!

3738
02:36:03,450 --> 02:36:03,890
Please!

3739
02:36:04,890 --> 02:36:05,190
Hahaha.

3740
02:36:08,770 --> 02:36:09,090
Okay.

3741
02:36:09,250 --> 02:36:09,650
It's fine.

3742
02:36:10,610 --> 02:36:11,070
It's fine.

3743
02:36:11,230 --> 02:36:12,450
I can run past all of this.

3744
02:36:12,910 --> 02:36:13,150
Oh, wait.

3745
02:36:13,230 --> 02:36:13,650
My item.

3746
02:36:14,270 --> 02:36:14,550
Woo!

3747
02:36:16,750 --> 02:36:17,850
Got item, though.

3748
02:36:18,690 --> 02:36:19,170
Ah!

3749
02:36:19,170 --> 02:36:19,750
Hahaha.

3750
02:36:20,450 --> 02:36:21,250
That's on me.

3751
02:36:21,530 --> 02:36:22,250
That's on me.

3752
02:36:22,330 --> 02:36:22,750
I got greedy.

3753
02:36:24,370 --> 02:36:24,930
Alright.

3754
02:36:26,410 --> 02:36:27,310
We made it.

3755
02:36:28,250 --> 02:36:28,690
Hahaha.

3756
02:36:29,650 --> 02:36:30,910
She can't go through doors.

3757
02:36:36,760 --> 02:36:37,560
Holy shit.

3758
02:36:37,720 --> 02:36:39,160
I thought she was gonna come over.

3759
02:36:39,380 --> 02:36:40,340
I thought she...

3760
02:36:40,340 --> 02:36:41,980
I thought she was gonna come over.

3761
02:36:42,220 --> 02:36:42,580
Oh.

3762
02:36:42,980 --> 02:36:43,500
Okay.

3763
02:36:43,900 --> 02:36:44,920
Okay, we're fine.

3764
02:36:47,800 --> 02:36:51,800
When she slowly approached me, I thought I was not fine.

3765
02:36:51,800 --> 02:36:52,640
But it's okay.

3766
02:36:52,780 --> 02:36:53,200
I'm fine.

3767
02:36:54,680 --> 02:36:56,560
Why does it always seems familiar?

3768
02:36:56,940 --> 02:36:57,700
What is...

3769
02:36:57,700 --> 02:36:58,120
Ah.

3770
02:36:58,440 --> 02:36:59,920
That's a boss bite right here.

3771
02:37:02,320 --> 02:37:02,840
Hahaha.

3772
02:37:06,700 --> 02:37:07,460
Oh, thank God.

3773
02:37:07,460 --> 02:37:08,060
There's a grace.

3774
02:37:10,420 --> 02:37:10,940
Nice.

3775
02:37:12,420 --> 02:37:12,760
Okay.

3776
02:37:13,540 --> 02:37:14,060
Let's...

3777
02:37:14,640 --> 02:37:16,240
Let's stay here for a little bit.

3778
02:37:16,660 --> 02:37:17,700
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

3779
02:37:17,740 --> 02:37:18,540
I'll be right back, chat.

3780
02:38:33,620 --> 02:38:34,120
Alright.

3781
02:38:34,280 --> 02:38:34,540
I'm back.

3782
02:38:35,200 --> 02:38:35,520
Okay.

3783
02:38:35,580 --> 02:38:37,720
Let me check something real quick.

3784
02:38:39,200 --> 02:38:39,700
Okay.

3785
02:38:40,460 --> 02:38:41,460
Some hydration.

3786
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:43,080
Hmm.

3787
02:38:44,800 --> 02:38:47,140
Senator, Chris, Johnny, thank you for the super chat.

3788
02:38:47,260 --> 02:38:47,500
Thank you.

3789
02:38:47,620 --> 02:38:48,200
Thank you.

3790
02:38:48,640 --> 02:38:49,040
Uh...

3791
02:38:49,040 --> 02:38:54,040
Powerball, Nexi, Mike, Neera, Solid, Snake, Bite, Alan, thank you for the super chat.

3792
02:38:54,160 --> 02:38:54,400
Thank you.

3793
02:38:54,540 --> 02:38:54,920
Thank you.

3794
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:55,100
Alright.

3795
02:38:55,260 --> 02:38:57,540
I feel like we should upgrade our stuff because it has been a while.

3796
02:39:00,200 --> 02:39:01,120
Let's go back.

3797
02:39:01,340 --> 02:39:04,600
Let's go back to see if there's like anything we can upgrade real quick.

3798
02:39:06,500 --> 02:39:08,480
Um, Yaku, thank you for the super chat.

3799
02:39:08,600 --> 02:39:08,840
Thank you.

3800
02:39:09,040 --> 02:39:09,580
Thank you.

3801
02:39:10,420 --> 02:39:12,140
Yes, I washed my hands, guys.

3802
02:39:12,560 --> 02:39:13,160
Of course I did.

3803
02:39:16,340 --> 02:39:16,700
Uh...

3804
02:39:16,700 --> 02:39:17,480
Oh, I don't have that.

3805
02:39:17,760 --> 02:39:18,640
I don't have a level six.

3806
02:39:18,880 --> 02:39:19,920
I don't know what I need.

3807
02:39:23,360 --> 02:39:26,660
Oh, I need one more level four Smithing Stone.

3808
02:39:28,580 --> 02:39:28,940
Ah...

3809
02:39:28,940 --> 02:39:30,580
Fuck, I don't know if it's worth it yet.

3810
02:39:33,340 --> 02:39:34,770
Okay, but like...

3811
02:39:35,900 --> 02:39:38,280
Do I really need a filler?

3812
02:39:38,420 --> 02:39:38,860
Another filler?

3813
02:39:39,040 --> 02:39:39,200
Guys.

3814
02:39:39,660 --> 02:39:43,920
We traveled so far already for no filler today.

3815
02:39:45,860 --> 02:39:49,920
We traveled so far without a filler episode.

3816
02:39:52,660 --> 02:39:53,440
Okay.

3817
02:39:54,340 --> 02:39:55,440
The next...

3818
02:39:55,440 --> 02:39:55,900
Okay.

3819
02:39:56,320 --> 02:39:56,640
Okay.

3820
02:39:56,960 --> 02:39:58,340
Where is the next mine?

3821
02:39:59,450 --> 02:40:00,400
Where do I go?

3822
02:40:00,580 --> 02:40:02,920
If I do do a mine, where is it?

3823
02:40:02,980 --> 02:40:03,060
Where is it?

3824
02:40:03,060 --> 02:40:03,920
We'll do one filler.

3825
02:40:05,200 --> 02:40:06,280
We'll do one filler.

3826
02:40:06,680 --> 02:40:07,060
Where do...

3827
02:40:07,060 --> 02:40:08,740
Oh my god, I don't even know where I came from.

3828
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:14,280
Okay, we're gonna figure out where I was, too, after this.

3829
02:40:14,380 --> 02:40:15,600
I actually don't remember.

3830
02:40:22,120 --> 02:40:24,160
Okay, where is the...

3831
02:40:24,160 --> 02:40:25,060
Where is the...

3832
02:40:25,060 --> 02:40:25,720
Is it this one?

3833
02:40:25,880 --> 02:40:26,720
Is it this mine?

3834
02:40:33,680 --> 02:40:34,120
No?

3835
02:40:34,520 --> 02:40:35,500
Which one is it?

3836
02:40:36,820 --> 02:40:37,800
Is it this one?

3837
02:40:41,820 --> 02:40:43,780
There's one that lets you like...

3838
02:40:43,780 --> 02:40:44,000
Uh...

3839
02:40:45,540 --> 02:40:45,980
Buy...

3840
02:40:45,980 --> 02:40:47,420
Oh, this one?

3841
02:40:47,600 --> 02:40:47,960
Okay.

3842
02:40:48,720 --> 02:40:51,880
So which one was the one that lets you buy stones later?

3843
02:40:52,420 --> 02:40:52,580
Though.

3844
02:40:52,940 --> 02:40:53,580
Is this one?

3845
02:40:59,560 --> 02:41:00,000
Okay.

3846
02:41:00,540 --> 02:41:01,400
Alright, we'll go here.

3847
02:41:05,600 --> 02:41:07,380
Actually, I don't know if that's the one where I can go.

3848
02:41:11,640 --> 02:41:11,960
Actually...

3849
02:41:12,380 --> 02:41:13,240
We go here?

3850
02:41:13,400 --> 02:41:14,320
Actually, we should go here.

3851
02:41:14,680 --> 02:41:16,180
And then walk up here, right?

3852
02:41:16,980 --> 02:41:17,300
Yeah.

3853
02:41:17,600 --> 02:41:18,420
I should go from here.

3854
02:41:20,120 --> 02:41:20,440
Yeah.

3855
02:41:20,440 --> 02:41:20,460
Yeah.

3856
02:41:20,620 --> 02:41:23,340
I was gonna say, I'm pretty sure I have to go through a boss fight.

3857
02:41:23,620 --> 02:41:24,420
Ha ha ha!

3858
02:41:30,550 --> 02:41:31,510
Okay, it's...

3859
02:41:31,510 --> 02:41:32,570
Should be this way.

3860
02:41:33,430 --> 02:41:35,690
Okay, we should actually march shit down now.

3861
02:41:36,390 --> 02:41:36,670
Alright.

3862
02:41:37,510 --> 02:41:38,350
Okay, let's go.

3863
02:41:38,490 --> 02:41:38,970
Oh my god.

3864
02:41:39,130 --> 02:41:40,010
We're Soling, guys.

3865
02:41:40,210 --> 02:41:40,970
We're Elden Ringing.

3866
02:41:41,490 --> 02:41:43,010
We're so good at this game.

3867
02:41:43,570 --> 02:41:44,670
Look at us go.

3868
02:41:45,550 --> 02:41:46,510
We're becoming...

3869
02:41:46,510 --> 02:41:47,790
We're Elden Ringing now.

3870
02:41:47,790 --> 02:41:48,530
Oh, hey.

3871
02:41:48,690 --> 02:41:48,970
Dude.

3872
02:41:50,110 --> 02:41:50,630
Hello.

3873
02:41:50,890 --> 02:41:51,270
Goodbye.

3874
02:41:52,410 --> 02:41:52,810
Grease?

3875
02:41:52,930 --> 02:41:54,890
The fuck are these woes doing with Grease?

3876
02:41:58,490 --> 02:41:59,010
Okay.

3877
02:41:59,250 --> 02:42:00,410
I think this is how you go down.

3878
02:42:00,690 --> 02:42:00,790
Yeah.

3879
02:42:03,830 --> 02:42:05,070
We're doing it, guys.

3880
02:42:05,310 --> 02:42:06,190
We're Elden Ringing.

3881
02:42:09,050 --> 02:42:09,710
On the...

3882
02:42:09,710 --> 02:42:10,730
I'm John Elden!

3883
02:42:11,150 --> 02:42:12,510
Ha ha ha ha!

3884
02:42:14,010 --> 02:42:15,570
Oh my god, guys.

3885
02:42:15,830 --> 02:42:17,050
I'm John Elden now.

3886
02:42:20,130 --> 02:42:20,710
Alright.

3887
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:26,160
Go this way.

3888
02:42:26,500 --> 02:42:27,540
Okay, there's the mines.

3889
02:42:28,820 --> 02:42:29,760
There it is.

3890
02:42:29,940 --> 02:42:31,160
No, that wasn't so hard.

3891
02:42:32,120 --> 02:42:32,980
Literally, right there.

3892
02:42:33,460 --> 02:42:34,300
Goodbye, horse.

3893
02:42:36,060 --> 02:42:36,640
Goodbye.

3894
02:42:40,910 --> 02:42:42,450
Oh, I hear the miners.

3895
02:42:43,670 --> 02:42:45,430
I'm yearning for those mines.

3896
02:42:47,490 --> 02:42:48,430
How do I get that?

3897
02:42:48,570 --> 02:42:49,090
Oh, there...

3898
02:42:52,230 --> 02:42:53,450
Fucking knew it.

3899
02:42:53,450 --> 02:42:54,250
I knew it.

3900
02:42:54,330 --> 02:42:55,930
I was like, why is there a random indent?

3901
02:42:56,690 --> 02:42:57,570
I knew it.

3902
02:42:57,690 --> 02:42:58,890
I know what you are.

3903
02:42:59,190 --> 02:43:00,410
Ha ha ha ha.

3904
02:43:02,030 --> 02:43:02,810
Oh, shit.

3905
02:43:04,070 --> 02:43:05,390
Oh my god.

3906
02:43:05,650 --> 02:43:07,050
Oh my god.

3907
02:43:07,050 --> 02:43:09,110
I forgot that they don't do pierce.

3908
02:43:09,210 --> 02:43:09,490
Oh!

3909
02:43:09,810 --> 02:43:10,230
Come on!

3910
02:43:11,390 --> 02:43:12,330
Is that fair?

3911
02:43:12,450 --> 02:43:13,070
Oh shit.

3912
02:43:13,350 --> 02:43:14,190
Oh my god.

3913
02:43:14,450 --> 02:43:15,610
Just beat me up.

3914
02:43:17,730 --> 02:43:19,930
Okay, this is awkward cause...

3915
02:43:19,930 --> 02:43:21,810
I need to figure out like...

3916
02:43:21,810 --> 02:43:22,610
Ha ha ha ha.

3917
02:43:22,610 --> 02:43:23,470
I don't have...

3918
02:43:23,470 --> 02:43:25,230
Actually have a weapon for these guys.

3919
02:43:27,990 --> 02:43:29,150
I have to use two hands?

3920
02:43:29,290 --> 02:43:29,830
What the fuck?

3921
02:43:29,950 --> 02:43:30,370
Oh my gosh.

3922
02:43:30,510 --> 02:43:30,810
Short King.

3923
02:43:31,790 --> 02:43:32,410
Let's go.

3924
02:43:37,520 --> 02:43:37,920
Okay.

3925
02:43:38,040 --> 02:43:39,100
These guys don't care.

3926
02:43:40,260 --> 02:43:40,840
That's fine.

3927
02:43:40,840 --> 02:43:42,700
I'm not looking to get these.

3928
02:43:46,620 --> 02:43:47,060
Okay.

3929
02:43:47,280 --> 02:43:47,560
Nice.

3930
02:43:49,640 --> 02:43:50,080
Okay.

3931
02:43:50,900 --> 02:43:51,340
Oh!

3932
02:43:51,620 --> 02:43:52,060
Shit!

3933
02:43:53,720 --> 02:43:55,200
What the fuck are you gonna blow fire?

3934
02:43:55,300 --> 02:43:55,620
Oh shit!

3935
02:43:55,720 --> 02:43:56,640
He is gonna blow fire!

3936
02:43:59,560 --> 02:44:01,860
I was like, what you shaking your lantern for?

3937
02:44:01,980 --> 02:44:02,420
Stupid!

3938
02:44:06,840 --> 02:44:07,700
Oh my god.

3939
02:44:07,920 --> 02:44:08,020
Okay.

3940
02:44:10,420 --> 02:44:10,860
Nice.

3941
02:44:13,460 --> 02:44:15,120
Yeah, I picked up the chest earlier.

3942
02:44:15,520 --> 02:44:16,340
I'm pretty sure I did.

3943
02:44:17,180 --> 02:44:17,420
Alright?

3944
02:44:18,360 --> 02:44:19,560
I'm gonna go check it again.

3945
02:44:20,100 --> 02:44:20,500
Oh my god.

3946
02:44:20,680 --> 02:44:22,180
It opened it and I was like, bye.

3947
02:44:22,700 --> 02:44:23,280
Ha ha ha!

3948
02:44:24,040 --> 02:44:26,600
I'm only here for the thrill of opening chests.

3949
02:44:32,520 --> 02:44:33,500
That's my thrill.

3950
02:44:36,900 --> 02:44:37,940
Has to be like...

3951
02:44:40,640 --> 02:44:42,360
Okay, it's a sealed tunnel.

3952
02:44:44,300 --> 02:44:46,340
So if there's a hole, there's a gold.

3953
02:44:47,120 --> 02:44:48,060
Oh my god.

3954
02:44:48,240 --> 02:44:49,100
Is it back here?

3955
02:44:51,220 --> 02:44:52,180
Oh my god.

3956
02:44:52,280 --> 02:44:52,940
It's back here.

3957
02:44:53,180 --> 02:44:54,700
It's next to the chest.

3958
02:44:56,380 --> 02:44:57,180
Clever, girl.

3959
02:45:09,070 --> 02:45:09,590
Alright.

3960
02:45:11,310 --> 02:45:12,590
And path ahead.

3961
02:45:12,590 --> 02:45:14,050
Behold attacking.

3962
02:45:14,890 --> 02:45:17,510
There's like 200 messages for this hidden path.

3963
02:45:22,820 --> 02:45:23,500
Alright.

3964
02:45:23,880 --> 02:45:24,840
Here I am.

3965
02:45:26,120 --> 02:45:27,780
Not so hidden, is it?

3966
02:45:28,720 --> 02:45:29,240
Try sword.

3967
02:45:29,420 --> 02:45:30,680
Fucking nah nah, nerd.

3968
02:45:34,600 --> 02:45:35,600
That's right.

3969
02:45:36,080 --> 02:45:37,860
Try to make me be a fucking nerd.

3970
02:45:38,580 --> 02:45:39,680
Get out of here.

3971
02:45:41,040 --> 02:45:41,720
Whoa!

3972
02:45:42,560 --> 02:45:45,970
My god!

3973
02:45:47,030 --> 02:45:48,010
Oh shit!

3974
02:45:51,660 --> 02:45:52,480
Oh my god.

3975
02:45:53,660 --> 02:45:54,820
Oh my god.

3976
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:55,840
Oh my god.

3977
02:45:55,960 --> 02:45:56,600
There's so many of them.

3978
02:45:57,220 --> 02:45:58,300
There's so many of them.

3979
02:46:02,860 --> 02:46:03,640
Holy shit.

3980
02:46:05,380 --> 02:46:05,900
What?

3981
02:46:06,440 --> 02:46:07,620
Like I can't see you?

3982
02:46:08,080 --> 02:46:08,600
Like...

3983
02:46:08,600 --> 02:46:08,940
What are you gonna do?

3984
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:10,260
Throw smoke at me?

3985
02:46:10,980 --> 02:46:12,260
Okay, I'm okay guys.

3986
02:46:12,520 --> 02:46:12,860
I'm...

3987
02:46:12,860 --> 02:46:13,660
I'm okay.

3988
02:46:14,040 --> 02:46:15,020
That was a little scary.

3989
02:46:15,220 --> 02:46:16,120
But I'm okay.

3990
02:46:21,610 --> 02:46:23,750
Go back to school.

3991
02:46:23,750 --> 02:46:25,730
Who let these kids here?

3992
02:46:28,770 --> 02:46:30,590
A pocket set.

3993
02:46:31,490 --> 02:46:32,670
Be wary of explosion.

3994
02:46:32,870 --> 02:46:33,170
Here.

3995
02:46:33,670 --> 02:46:34,590
What is here?

3996
02:46:35,550 --> 02:46:36,490
What do you mean here?

3997
02:46:38,450 --> 02:46:39,330
Oh my god.

3998
02:46:39,470 --> 02:46:40,330
It's literally right here.

3999
02:46:40,870 --> 02:46:41,370
It's...

4000
02:46:45,470 --> 02:46:47,090
Bro, what the fuck do I do?

4001
02:46:48,870 --> 02:46:49,430
Oh!

4002
02:46:49,750 --> 02:46:51,590
That's what he meant by here!

4003
02:46:52,170 --> 02:46:52,490
Oh!

4004
02:46:57,250 --> 02:46:58,290
Didn't get me.

4005
02:47:00,950 --> 02:47:01,790
Okay, nice.

4006
02:47:01,790 --> 02:47:01,950
Nice.

4007
02:47:02,370 --> 02:47:04,310
I was like, what the fuck does he mean here?

4008
02:47:08,360 --> 02:47:09,440
Oh, nice item.

4009
02:47:15,790 --> 02:47:16,270
Okay.

4010
02:47:17,170 --> 02:47:18,290
I need this though.

4011
02:47:18,470 --> 02:47:18,770
Yoink!

4012
02:47:21,250 --> 02:47:21,730
Explode!

4013
02:47:25,810 --> 02:47:29,470
To be fair, I thought that I was far enough.

4014
02:47:30,070 --> 02:47:30,470
To be fair.

4015
02:47:31,070 --> 02:47:31,190
I...

4016
02:47:31,190 --> 02:47:32,830
I didn't think I was that close.

4017
02:47:33,470 --> 02:47:33,810
I...

4018
02:47:34,730 --> 02:47:35,970
I was like...

4019
02:47:37,210 --> 02:47:38,070
Explode on me.

4020
02:47:38,170 --> 02:47:39,870
What's gonna happen to me anyway?

4021
02:47:40,450 --> 02:47:41,050
Nothing.

4022
02:47:41,910 --> 02:47:43,670
In the end something happened.

4023
02:47:45,930 --> 02:47:46,850
Trap ahead?

4024
02:47:52,080 --> 02:47:52,800
Okay.

4025
02:47:52,980 --> 02:47:53,160
Okay, nice.

4026
02:47:54,760 --> 02:47:56,100
And then hidden.

4027
02:47:56,340 --> 02:47:56,520
Nice.

4028
02:47:59,160 --> 02:48:00,580
Jesus Christ.

4029
02:48:00,580 --> 02:48:02,780
How many areas are there?

4030
02:48:04,160 --> 02:48:05,080
Oh no.

4031
02:48:06,520 --> 02:48:07,100
Okay.

4032
02:48:07,700 --> 02:48:09,620
I should fall in the center.

4033
02:48:12,040 --> 02:48:12,760
God.

4034
02:48:13,300 --> 02:48:14,420
This is way too much.

4035
02:48:17,730 --> 02:48:19,330
Okay, how important is that though?

4036
02:48:19,970 --> 02:48:20,910
Can't be that important.

4037
02:48:28,780 --> 02:48:29,380
Woo!

4038
02:48:29,840 --> 02:48:30,640
Made it.

4039
02:48:32,080 --> 02:48:32,920
Try item.

4040
02:48:33,120 --> 02:48:33,760
Try jumping.

4041
02:48:34,020 --> 02:48:34,940
Okay, but is that...

4042
02:48:35,720 --> 02:48:36,540
I can't...

4043
02:48:36,540 --> 02:48:38,080
I don't believe it's that important.

4044
02:48:40,660 --> 02:48:43,800
I refuse to believe that item is important.

4045
02:48:44,740 --> 02:48:45,600
It's not.

4046
02:48:45,780 --> 02:48:46,880
You can't fucking bait me.

4047
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:48,200
I know it's not important.

4048
02:48:48,440 --> 02:48:49,680
I know it's not.

4049
02:48:57,270 --> 02:48:58,910
Therefore likely rolling.

4050
02:49:00,150 --> 02:49:02,230
Okay, but where the fuck do I drop down?

4051
02:49:03,670 --> 02:49:04,130
Here?

4052
02:49:04,590 --> 02:49:06,410
Do I live if I drop down here?

4053
02:49:14,170 --> 02:49:15,610
Doki, you have to go there.

4054
02:49:15,730 --> 02:49:17,230
That's where the Elden Ring is.

4055
02:49:21,350 --> 02:49:23,130
Doki, you're missing the Elden Ring.

4056
02:49:24,830 --> 02:49:26,890
The Elden Ring is literally right there.

4057
02:49:28,950 --> 02:49:32,150
You can end the game right now if you get it.

4058
02:49:36,960 --> 02:49:37,560
Oh.

4059
02:49:38,880 --> 02:49:40,660
This looks like a boss fight.

4060
02:49:42,200 --> 02:49:44,400
But then this also looks like danger.

4061
02:49:45,540 --> 02:49:46,380
Dead end ahead.

4062
02:49:46,840 --> 02:49:47,840
Could this be rolling?

4063
02:49:48,980 --> 02:49:49,420
Something?

4064
02:49:49,420 --> 02:49:49,900
Something ahead?

4065
02:49:52,960 --> 02:49:53,800
Oh my god.

4066
02:49:58,300 --> 02:49:59,760
Oh my god, I fucking...

4067
02:49:59,760 --> 02:50:00,480
Oh my god.

4068
02:50:00,680 --> 02:50:01,640
Oh my god.

4069
02:50:01,820 --> 02:50:01,980
Okay.

4070
02:50:02,480 --> 02:50:03,340
Okay, me and no.

4071
02:50:03,480 --> 02:50:03,640
Okay.

4072
02:50:05,700 --> 02:50:06,140
Okay.

4073
02:50:06,640 --> 02:50:07,500
Okay, he's naked.

4074
02:50:07,800 --> 02:50:08,880
He can't be that good.

4075
02:50:09,020 --> 02:50:09,400
He's naked.

4076
02:50:21,100 --> 02:50:21,780
Okay.

4077
02:50:22,260 --> 02:50:23,240
Oh shit!

4078
02:50:23,780 --> 02:50:25,140
What the fuck did he do?

4079
02:50:25,620 --> 02:50:26,660
Oh my god.

4080
02:50:26,980 --> 02:50:28,060
What did he do?

4081
02:50:32,760 --> 02:50:33,920
Oh shit!

4082
02:50:34,620 --> 02:50:35,820
He's a nerd.

4083
02:50:35,980 --> 02:50:36,580
But he's naked.

4084
02:50:36,580 --> 02:50:36,680
He's naked.

4085
02:50:39,160 --> 02:50:40,000
What?

4086
02:50:41,160 --> 02:50:42,920
Okay, every time I get close.

4087
02:50:44,220 --> 02:50:44,700
Oh!

4088
02:50:52,060 --> 02:50:52,900
Okay.

4089
02:50:54,640 --> 02:50:56,140
Are you serious?

4090
02:50:58,560 --> 02:51:00,040
Who are you?

4091
02:51:00,480 --> 02:51:00,880
Fuck.

4092
02:51:03,600 --> 02:51:04,360
Oh my god.

4093
02:51:09,810 --> 02:51:11,410
Oh my god, I fucked it up.

4094
02:51:14,750 --> 02:51:15,930
Oh shit!

4095
02:51:17,190 --> 02:51:18,210
Okay, nice.

4096
02:51:20,030 --> 02:51:21,070
Okay, I got him.

4097
02:51:21,830 --> 02:51:22,970
I got him.

4098
02:51:23,130 --> 02:51:23,530
It's fine.

4099
02:51:23,850 --> 02:51:24,930
I got him.

4100
02:51:25,330 --> 02:51:26,310
It's okay.

4101
02:51:27,610 --> 02:51:29,330
Nothing to worry about.

4102
02:51:30,150 --> 02:51:31,570
I did it.

4103
02:51:32,610 --> 02:51:33,970
Easy as hell.

4104
02:51:35,870 --> 02:51:37,530
Not even close.

4105
02:51:38,510 --> 02:51:39,470
Let's go.

4106
02:51:40,590 --> 02:51:41,610
Oh hey, there's a grease.

4107
02:51:42,010 --> 02:51:42,670
First try.

4108
02:51:44,470 --> 02:51:45,910
First fucking try.

4109
02:51:46,770 --> 02:51:48,090
My mini filler episode.

4110
02:51:48,270 --> 02:51:49,290
Oh hey, there's the other tree.

4111
02:51:53,320 --> 02:51:53,940
Three ahead.

4112
02:51:54,280 --> 02:51:54,360
Tree.

4113
02:51:55,760 --> 02:51:56,360
Nice.

4114
02:51:56,680 --> 02:51:57,220
There's the tree.

4115
02:52:00,790 --> 02:52:01,390
Alright.

4116
02:52:02,190 --> 02:52:03,250
Where is this?

4117
02:52:05,810 --> 02:52:08,490
Seek something incredible or dead end.

4118
02:52:09,990 --> 02:52:11,090
What's this?

4119
02:52:11,870 --> 02:52:13,390
Is this the Elden Ring?

4120
02:52:16,070 --> 02:52:16,850
Hello?

4121
02:52:18,410 --> 02:52:19,190
Hello?

4122
02:52:23,100 --> 02:52:24,560
Behold, I did it.

4123
02:52:24,560 --> 02:52:25,040
Oh my god.

4124
02:52:25,160 --> 02:52:25,220
Oh my god.

4125
02:52:25,220 --> 02:52:26,460
Am I gonna get the Elden Ring?

4126
02:52:36,100 --> 02:52:36,560
Hello?

4127
02:52:40,640 --> 02:52:41,100
Hello?

4128
02:52:41,440 --> 02:52:41,660
Ooh.

4129
02:52:42,240 --> 02:52:43,560
Look at all the pretty...

4130
02:52:43,560 --> 02:52:43,800
Whoa!

4131
02:52:44,540 --> 02:52:45,620
Message of praise.

4132
02:52:46,040 --> 02:52:46,500
Thank you.

4133
02:52:46,720 --> 02:52:47,140
Thank you.

4134
02:52:49,700 --> 02:52:51,640
I mean, look at all these shagging rocks.

4135
02:52:54,720 --> 02:52:55,380
Oh my god.

4136
02:52:55,500 --> 02:52:56,060
I could have leveled up.

4137
02:52:56,240 --> 02:52:57,000
Oh my god.

4138
02:52:57,380 --> 02:52:58,060
Okay, that's fine.

4139
02:52:58,680 --> 02:52:58,880
I'm clear.

4140
02:52:59,020 --> 02:53:00,480
I'm pretty sure there's no boss battle here.

4141
02:53:01,200 --> 02:53:02,760
I'm pretty sure it's just pretty rocks.

4142
02:53:04,920 --> 02:53:05,960
Oh, it's another grace.

4143
02:53:06,740 --> 02:53:08,140
Where the fuck am I?

4144
02:53:08,760 --> 02:53:09,140
I...

4145
02:53:10,680 --> 02:53:11,880
I'm at a weird part.

4146
02:53:12,040 --> 02:53:12,260
I...

4147
02:53:12,260 --> 02:53:14,280
I accidentally got into a filler episode.

4148
02:53:14,320 --> 02:53:15,400
So I don't know where I am.

4149
02:53:20,720 --> 02:53:21,280
Okay.

4150
02:53:21,640 --> 02:53:22,620
Let's get...

4151
02:53:24,740 --> 02:53:26,160
I should be able to level up.

4152
02:53:30,740 --> 02:53:31,300
Alright.

4153
02:53:32,640 --> 02:53:33,520
Level up.

4154
02:53:33,800 --> 02:53:34,680
And then...

4155
02:53:34,680 --> 02:53:35,220
Dexterity.

4156
02:53:37,920 --> 02:53:39,500
Yes, I'm not gonna jump.

4157
02:53:40,020 --> 02:53:41,240
I'm not...

4158
02:53:44,530 --> 02:53:46,010
What is this place?

4159
02:53:46,010 --> 02:53:46,870
Hello?

4160
02:53:51,450 --> 02:53:52,290
Wait, what?

4161
02:53:53,090 --> 02:53:54,250
What is this for?

4162
02:53:58,750 --> 02:53:59,950
I don't know what I did.

4163
02:54:01,150 --> 02:54:01,710
Oh!

4164
02:54:01,930 --> 02:54:04,050
I got Rykard's great rune.

4165
02:54:04,270 --> 02:54:04,710
Cool!

4166
02:54:11,650 --> 02:54:12,990
Visions of fire.

4167
02:54:13,410 --> 02:54:14,290
I did it!

4168
02:54:14,850 --> 02:54:15,830
Is that...

4169
02:54:17,470 --> 02:54:18,590
Oh my god!

4170
02:54:18,850 --> 02:54:19,330
Is that...

4171
02:54:19,330 --> 02:54:20,330
Is that the other ring?

4172
02:54:21,230 --> 02:54:22,050
Did I do it?

4173
02:54:22,050 --> 02:54:23,050
Alright, now...

4174
02:54:24,810 --> 02:54:25,370
Now...

4175
02:54:25,370 --> 02:54:26,210
I should be able to...

4176
02:54:26,210 --> 02:54:27,330
Buy some stuff.

4177
02:54:32,120 --> 02:54:34,440
Alright, now I should be able to upgrade shit now.

4178
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:37,100
You did it!

4179
02:54:37,300 --> 02:54:37,900
A tree!

4180
02:54:39,140 --> 02:54:40,800
I took you for no matter.

4181
02:54:40,900 --> 02:54:41,480
Stay out your arm.

4182
02:54:41,720 --> 02:54:43,380
Every time he thinks I died.

4183
02:54:43,640 --> 02:54:44,000
Okay.

4184
02:54:44,280 --> 02:54:45,180
I still don't have enough.

4185
02:54:45,520 --> 02:54:46,460
So that means...

4186
02:54:46,460 --> 02:54:47,460
I have to go back.

4187
02:54:47,820 --> 02:54:49,300
Give the bell to the lady.

4188
02:54:49,740 --> 02:54:51,520
And then buy more runes.

4189
02:54:51,640 --> 02:54:52,760
And then go back to him.

4190
02:54:52,900 --> 02:54:53,800
Upgrade my sword.

4191
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:55,840
And then go back to the main storyline.

4192
02:54:57,760 --> 02:54:58,360
Oh.

4193
02:54:58,380 --> 02:54:58,920
Hello.

4194
02:55:01,980 --> 02:55:02,580
Okay.

4195
02:55:04,940 --> 02:55:05,880
Was it three?

4196
02:55:06,500 --> 02:55:07,420
That's three, right?

4197
02:55:07,660 --> 02:55:07,980
Okay.

4198
02:55:10,700 --> 02:55:12,120
Oh fuck, it wasn't three.

4199
02:55:12,220 --> 02:55:12,640
It was four.

4200
02:55:12,940 --> 02:55:13,560
I can't count.

4201
02:55:14,600 --> 02:55:15,520
It's four.

4202
02:55:16,640 --> 02:55:18,780
Okay, let me pop some runes real quick.

4203
02:55:24,610 --> 02:55:25,170
Hello.

4204
02:55:25,590 --> 02:55:26,310
M'lady.

4205
02:55:26,610 --> 02:55:28,270
I'm just popping some runes.

4206
02:55:31,290 --> 02:55:32,610
There's three and four.

4207
02:55:33,110 --> 02:55:34,010
I'm back.

4208
02:55:34,370 --> 02:55:35,670
You're looking pretty.

4209
02:55:36,030 --> 02:55:37,850
You're looking pretty young, ladies.

4210
02:55:38,310 --> 02:55:39,690
Oh my god, is that your sister?

4211
02:55:40,670 --> 02:55:41,130
Whoa.

4212
02:55:41,670 --> 02:55:43,590
You guys don't look a day over a thousand.

4213
02:55:45,730 --> 02:55:47,590
Yeah, but I think I need one for each.

4214
02:55:47,730 --> 02:55:49,430
I wonder how many runes I need after.

4215
02:55:49,830 --> 02:55:51,510
I have stones I need for this.

4216
02:55:52,450 --> 02:55:52,990
No matter.

4217
02:55:55,150 --> 02:55:56,690
Okay, we'll grab this.

4218
02:56:00,620 --> 02:56:02,360
Oh my god, I can just keep going.

4219
02:56:02,620 --> 02:56:02,760
Okay.

4220
02:56:03,780 --> 02:56:04,380
Uh...

4221
02:56:04,380 --> 02:56:05,320
And then...

4222
02:56:05,320 --> 02:56:06,420
I need...

4223
02:56:06,420 --> 02:56:07,360
Six of three.

4224
02:56:07,620 --> 02:56:07,840
Okay.

4225
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:09,760
Six of three.

4226
02:56:10,060 --> 02:56:10,780
And then...

4227
02:56:10,780 --> 02:56:11,440
We should be good.

4228
02:56:20,340 --> 02:56:20,940
Okay.

4229
02:56:22,220 --> 02:56:23,340
Six of three.

4230
02:56:28,410 --> 02:56:29,010
Oh.

4231
02:56:29,310 --> 02:56:29,650
Wait.

4232
02:56:30,230 --> 02:56:31,510
I need...

4233
02:56:31,510 --> 02:56:31,750
Fuck.

4234
02:56:31,750 --> 02:56:33,210
I need...

4235
02:56:33,210 --> 02:56:34,950
Crack up some more runes.

4236
02:56:39,060 --> 02:56:40,340
And I need more, right?

4237
02:56:40,540 --> 02:56:41,320
I don't have a lot.

4238
02:56:45,040 --> 02:56:45,960
Fuck is it?

4239
02:56:48,200 --> 02:56:49,200
Oh, there it is.

4240
02:56:51,840 --> 02:56:52,360
Alright.

4241
02:56:52,760 --> 02:56:53,040
Wait.

4242
02:56:53,140 --> 02:56:54,100
Is plus 14 good?

4243
02:56:54,900 --> 02:56:55,700
Oh, nice.

4244
02:56:55,920 --> 02:56:56,280
Fuck yeah.

4245
02:57:00,190 --> 02:57:01,710
We need five of this.

4246
02:57:03,450 --> 02:57:04,050
Alright.

4247
02:57:04,190 --> 02:57:05,330
So we can upgrade our poison.

4248
02:57:12,280 --> 02:57:12,880
Alright.

4249
02:57:14,400 --> 02:57:15,760
Upgrade my sword.

4250
02:57:16,480 --> 02:57:16,780
Sir?

4251
02:57:20,440 --> 02:57:21,040
Alright.

4252
02:57:21,220 --> 02:57:22,320
And then...

4253
02:57:22,320 --> 02:57:23,160
Um...

4254
02:57:23,160 --> 02:57:23,880
Is it worth...

4255
02:57:25,060 --> 02:57:25,800
Fuck it.

4256
02:57:25,880 --> 02:57:26,460
Let's keep upgrading.

4257
02:57:30,440 --> 02:57:31,040
Alright.

4258
02:57:31,440 --> 02:57:32,420
So we should grab more.

4259
02:57:33,380 --> 02:57:33,980
Fuck it.

4260
02:57:33,980 --> 02:57:34,560
We might as well.

4261
02:57:37,280 --> 02:57:37,640
Alright.

4262
02:57:37,880 --> 02:57:38,260
I'm back.

4263
02:57:38,720 --> 02:57:39,700
We need four, right?

4264
02:57:46,570 --> 02:57:47,150
Grab ten.

4265
02:57:47,390 --> 02:57:48,210
I think it was ten, right?

4266
02:57:48,470 --> 02:57:51,830
It was two, four, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine...

4267
02:57:51,830 --> 02:57:52,170
Yeah, ten.

4268
02:57:54,650 --> 02:57:55,010
Wait.

4269
02:57:57,150 --> 02:57:57,970
I need two more.

4270
02:57:58,150 --> 02:57:58,730
I can't count.

4271
02:58:00,730 --> 02:58:01,090
Whoops.

4272
02:58:02,890 --> 02:58:03,590
Sorry.

4273
02:58:03,690 --> 02:58:05,050
I'm not counting, right?

4274
02:58:08,010 --> 02:58:08,710
Boop.

4275
02:58:10,870 --> 02:58:12,050
I can buy another one.

4276
02:58:13,890 --> 02:58:14,590
Alright.

4277
02:58:14,990 --> 02:58:16,270
And then...

4278
02:58:16,270 --> 02:58:16,670
Now!

4279
02:58:16,670 --> 02:58:19,050
I should be able to upgrade my poison katana.

4280
02:58:20,890 --> 02:58:21,590
There we go.

4281
02:58:23,870 --> 02:58:24,730
Here I go.

4282
02:58:26,410 --> 02:58:27,850
I went through...

4283
02:58:27,850 --> 02:58:28,990
One ep...

4284
02:58:28,990 --> 02:58:31,510
One and a half episode of this failure for this.

4285
02:58:33,410 --> 02:58:34,210
Oh my god.

4286
02:58:34,250 --> 02:58:34,950
I'm broke again.

4287
02:58:35,150 --> 02:58:35,950
Jesus Christ.

4288
02:58:36,570 --> 02:58:38,770
I'm broke again.

4289
02:58:42,010 --> 02:58:42,570
Pop!

4290
02:58:44,610 --> 02:58:45,170
Alright.

4291
02:58:46,650 --> 02:58:47,690
I'm always back.

4292
02:58:48,030 --> 02:58:49,310
I'm always back for more.

4293
02:58:53,280 --> 02:58:54,260
Eh, fuck it.

4294
02:58:54,560 --> 02:58:55,000
Let's go.

4295
02:58:55,000 --> 02:58:55,680
Alright.

4296
02:58:55,920 --> 02:58:57,460
Now we're good to go.

4297
02:59:01,340 --> 02:59:01,680
Alright.

4298
02:59:03,980 --> 02:59:04,660
Now...

4299
02:59:04,660 --> 02:59:05,320
Now we're...

4300
02:59:05,320 --> 02:59:06,240
Now we're cheeked up.

4301
02:59:06,620 --> 02:59:07,240
We're ready.

4302
02:59:09,200 --> 02:59:10,360
Okay, here.

4303
02:59:11,460 --> 02:59:12,840
The vine bridge.

4304
02:59:17,220 --> 02:59:17,900
Alright.

4305
02:59:18,080 --> 02:59:19,000
Time for the boss fight.

4306
02:59:20,160 --> 02:59:22,920
How bad can I be?

4307
02:59:23,420 --> 02:59:25,420
I'm just doing what's unnecessary.

4308
02:59:28,740 --> 02:59:30,060
Oh, it's not summable.

4309
02:59:30,380 --> 02:59:30,620
Okay.

4310
02:59:34,550 --> 02:59:35,150
Okay.

4311
02:59:35,430 --> 02:59:35,530
Okay.

4312
02:59:35,530 --> 02:59:36,370
Oh, shit.

4313
02:59:40,390 --> 02:59:41,370
Oh, shit.

4314
02:59:41,370 --> 02:59:41,690
Oh my god.

4315
02:59:41,870 --> 02:59:43,310
You're not even a boss fight.

4316
02:59:47,190 --> 02:59:48,130
Oh, shit!

4317
02:59:48,330 --> 02:59:48,750
Oh shit!

4318
02:59:50,410 --> 02:59:51,030
Oh, shit!

4319
02:59:51,690 --> 02:59:54,370
Oh, shit!

4320
03:00:00,290 --> 03:00:00,890
Okay.

4321
03:00:00,890 --> 03:00:01,310
Oh shit.

4322
03:00:03,770 --> 03:00:06,070
Oh my god, it's so delayed!

4323
03:00:06,950 --> 03:00:08,390
It's not fair!

4324
03:00:15,090 --> 03:00:16,050
It's fine.

4325
03:00:19,210 --> 03:00:19,890
Okay.

4326
03:00:22,990 --> 03:00:24,050
Okay, it's fine.

4327
03:00:25,650 --> 03:00:26,010
Whoa!

4328
03:00:28,790 --> 03:00:31,430
I don't know, maybe I'll poison fuck a rock.

4329
03:00:32,210 --> 03:00:32,890
Maybe...

4330
03:00:34,470 --> 03:00:35,630
Why is it a rock?

4331
03:00:35,850 --> 03:00:36,710
I don't know.

4332
03:00:40,250 --> 03:00:41,190
Okay, it's fine.

4333
03:00:41,310 --> 03:00:41,690
He's dead.

4334
03:00:42,330 --> 03:00:43,130
It's fine.

4335
03:00:43,350 --> 03:00:43,750
It's dead.

4336
03:00:44,170 --> 03:00:48,970
I don't know if it was worth killing him, but I think he's... I think he'll come back.

4337
03:00:49,170 --> 03:00:51,130
Wait, he doesn't even give me anything.

4338
03:00:51,570 --> 03:00:52,650
Wait, what?

4339
03:00:55,410 --> 03:00:57,430
You don't even give me anything?

4340
03:01:02,400 --> 03:01:03,440
Oh my god.

4341
03:01:03,720 --> 03:01:04,840
Oh my god.

4342
03:01:05,760 --> 03:01:07,300
Your life has no meaning.

4343
03:01:07,720 --> 03:01:08,800
I can't believe it.

4344
03:01:09,940 --> 03:01:11,920
His life actually has no meaning.

4345
03:01:12,740 --> 03:01:13,280
Alright, nice.

4346
03:01:13,440 --> 03:01:14,720
I have a... Oh, yippee.

4347
03:01:14,980 --> 03:01:15,280
I guess.

4348
03:01:15,900 --> 03:01:16,080
Ooh.

4349
03:01:17,380 --> 03:01:17,980
Oh, wait.

4350
03:01:18,060 --> 03:01:18,480
Actually, wait.

4351
03:01:18,560 --> 03:01:18,980
Actually, no.

4352
03:01:19,100 --> 03:01:19,760
This is yippee.

4353
03:01:19,860 --> 03:01:20,120
Oh, wait.

4354
03:01:20,680 --> 03:01:21,160
Yippee.

4355
03:01:22,520 --> 03:01:23,340
Oh my god.

4356
03:01:23,440 --> 03:01:24,160
This is yippee.

4357
03:01:24,380 --> 03:01:25,100
Oh my god.

4358
03:01:31,960 --> 03:01:32,920
Wait a minute.

4359
03:01:34,860 --> 03:01:36,820
It actually goaded.

4360
03:01:40,640 --> 03:01:44,960
Look at that HP go up so fast, Doki.

4361
03:01:50,760 --> 03:01:51,200
What?

4362
03:01:55,660 --> 03:01:56,780
What do you mean?

4363
03:02:02,350 --> 03:02:03,510
Oh my god.

4364
03:02:03,770 --> 03:02:03,930
Okay.

4365
03:02:06,430 --> 03:02:08,110
Where am I supposed to go?

4366
03:02:16,620 --> 03:02:18,180
I don't have...

4367
03:02:18,180 --> 03:02:21,040
What am I supposed to...

4368
03:02:22,200 --> 03:02:24,200
Oh, it's always the tree.

4369
03:02:24,520 --> 03:02:24,980
It's...

4370
03:02:24,980 --> 03:02:26,660
Dude, that tree.

4371
03:02:27,580 --> 03:02:30,440
Why is it always the pocket tree?

4372
03:02:33,060 --> 03:02:33,900
Alright.

4373
03:02:40,410 --> 03:02:41,990
Where is the closest?

4374
03:02:44,510 --> 03:02:45,730
Is it here?

4375
03:02:55,100 --> 03:02:55,580
Okay.

4376
03:02:55,880 --> 03:02:56,300
Capital.

4377
03:02:58,780 --> 03:03:00,180
It's up the dragon?

4378
03:03:00,440 --> 03:03:03,320
I didn't do the right dragon parkour?

4379
03:03:04,680 --> 03:03:05,700
Where am I?

4380
03:03:05,940 --> 03:03:06,600
Oh, it's up here.

4381
03:03:06,780 --> 03:03:06,940
Okay.

4382
03:03:08,480 --> 03:03:08,960
Okay.

4383
03:03:09,140 --> 03:03:09,520
It's here.

4384
03:03:10,620 --> 03:03:11,480
Did you just go straight?

4385
03:03:13,740 --> 03:03:15,080
Just go straight then, right?

4386
03:03:20,990 --> 03:03:21,470
Oh!

4387
03:03:21,750 --> 03:03:22,890
Those tree roots.

4388
03:03:23,070 --> 03:03:23,230
Okay.

4389
03:03:23,270 --> 03:03:24,270
I just gotta do that again.

4390
03:03:27,450 --> 03:03:28,290
Oh my god.

4391
03:03:28,450 --> 03:03:28,810
I lived.

4392
03:03:32,300 --> 03:03:34,700
Time to climb the tree to get to a big tree.

4393
03:03:41,440 --> 03:03:41,940
Alright.

4394
03:03:42,100 --> 03:03:42,560
Here we go.

4395
03:03:44,040 --> 03:03:46,240
Climb the tree to get to a big tree.

4396
03:03:47,220 --> 03:03:49,200
Coming over, Mr. Big Tree.

4397
03:03:49,740 --> 03:03:51,000
Is he a bad person?

4398
03:03:52,220 --> 03:03:53,140
Oh no.

4399
03:03:53,320 --> 03:03:54,340
They're tree men.

4400
03:03:55,660 --> 03:03:56,660
Oh no.

4401
03:04:02,880 --> 03:04:04,100
Oh wait, they're weak.

4402
03:04:04,360 --> 03:04:04,900
Okay, thank god.

4403
03:04:06,360 --> 03:04:07,640
Okay, thank god they're weak.

4404
03:04:10,740 --> 03:04:11,800
Oh, thank god.

4405
03:04:15,390 --> 03:04:16,490
Alright, get him out.

4406
03:04:16,670 --> 03:04:17,110
Oh shit.

4407
03:04:17,230 --> 03:04:17,530
Hey there.

4408
03:04:21,030 --> 03:04:22,030
Oh my god.

4409
03:04:22,170 --> 03:04:23,830
No, he drops poison!

4410
03:04:24,550 --> 03:04:25,350
Okay, it's fine.

4411
03:04:29,730 --> 03:04:30,010
Okay.

4412
03:04:30,910 --> 03:04:31,690
Your buddy's dead.

4413
03:04:32,790 --> 03:04:33,270
Goodbye.

4414
03:04:37,410 --> 03:04:38,410
Alright, it's fine.

4415
03:04:38,590 --> 03:04:39,350
We're still fine.

4416
03:04:43,030 --> 03:04:44,150
What the fuck?

4417
03:04:44,930 --> 03:04:46,010
What are you doing?

4418
03:04:47,350 --> 03:04:48,870
It's just chilling up there.

4419
03:04:51,650 --> 03:04:52,390
Oh shit.

4420
03:04:52,550 --> 03:04:54,250
I thought they lined up for me.

4421
03:04:54,850 --> 03:04:55,870
I'm not gonna lie.

4422
03:04:57,230 --> 03:04:58,510
It literally looks...

4423
03:04:58,510 --> 03:04:59,210
Oh shit!

4424
03:04:59,510 --> 03:04:59,850
Oh my god.

4425
03:04:59,870 --> 03:05:00,290
I'm gonna fall.

4426
03:05:00,530 --> 03:05:01,310
I'm gonna fall.

4427
03:05:03,930 --> 03:05:06,910
Okay, but it actually looked like they were just gonna line up for me.

4428
03:05:08,810 --> 03:05:09,690
Oh no.

4429
03:05:10,270 --> 03:05:10,690
It's fine.

4430
03:05:15,150 --> 03:05:15,870
It's okay.

4431
03:05:16,070 --> 03:05:17,350
I'm just a little poison.

4432
03:05:18,650 --> 03:05:20,630
Oh, apparently these guys don't attack.

4433
03:05:20,750 --> 03:05:21,690
The ones with no flowers.

4434
03:05:25,010 --> 03:05:25,630
It's fine.

4435
03:05:25,630 --> 03:05:26,710
I'm just a little poison.

4436
03:05:27,770 --> 03:05:28,830
Doesn't hurt nobody.

4437
03:05:29,690 --> 03:05:30,250
You know what?

4438
03:05:30,250 --> 03:05:31,250
I want the extra souls.

4439
03:05:31,710 --> 03:05:32,630
Get over here.

4440
03:05:35,810 --> 03:05:36,690
That's right.

4441
03:05:37,450 --> 03:05:38,330
That 500?

4442
03:05:38,670 --> 03:05:39,230
Yummy, yummy.

4443
03:05:39,870 --> 03:05:40,630
Good enough.

4444
03:05:45,380 --> 03:05:46,020
Alright.

4445
03:05:47,880 --> 03:05:49,240
Okay, you have a flower.

4446
03:05:49,400 --> 03:05:50,020
You must die.

4447
03:05:54,820 --> 03:05:56,400
No flower for you.

4448
03:05:58,800 --> 03:06:00,100
Tarnish required ahead.

4449
03:06:00,740 --> 03:06:01,560
Boss ahead.

4450
03:06:01,940 --> 03:06:02,480
Good luck.

4451
03:06:02,700 --> 03:06:03,140
Oh shit.

4452
03:06:03,300 --> 03:06:04,240
Maybe I shouldn't have got poison.

4453
03:06:07,440 --> 03:06:07,900
Shit.

4454
03:06:08,480 --> 03:06:08,720
Okay.

4455
03:06:09,340 --> 03:06:09,500
Alright.

4456
03:06:09,660 --> 03:06:10,400
Well, that's too bad.

4457
03:06:10,520 --> 03:06:12,040
I have to live with my consequences.

4458
03:06:12,040 --> 03:06:12,760
I guess.

4459
03:06:13,000 --> 03:06:13,720
I...

4460
03:06:13,720 --> 03:06:14,820
Oh shit.

4461
03:06:15,080 --> 03:06:16,400
Oh shit.

4462
03:06:16,640 --> 03:06:17,020
I don't...

4463
03:06:17,020 --> 03:06:17,760
Oh my god.

4464
03:06:17,900 --> 03:06:18,300
It's you.

4465
03:06:22,700 --> 03:06:23,620
Oh shit.

4466
03:06:24,120 --> 03:06:25,160
Oh fuck.

4467
03:06:25,480 --> 03:06:25,580
Okay.

4468
03:06:26,420 --> 03:06:27,140
Okay.

4469
03:06:27,260 --> 03:06:27,960
That was a...

4470
03:06:27,960 --> 03:06:30,820
That was a mistake and a half.

4471
03:06:32,520 --> 03:06:33,900
That guy...

4472
03:06:33,900 --> 03:06:35,220
Guys, no I can't.

4473
03:06:35,220 --> 03:06:35,840
I...

4474
03:06:42,520 --> 03:06:43,120
Okay.

4475
03:06:43,520 --> 03:06:44,440
I wasn't ready.

4476
03:06:44,660 --> 03:06:46,300
Mentally I was not there.

4477
03:06:46,500 --> 03:06:47,940
I was not there.

4478
03:06:48,620 --> 03:06:50,640
Mentally my head was not there.

4479
03:06:50,760 --> 03:06:52,180
I have to admit.

4480
03:06:52,680 --> 03:06:52,980
I...

4481
03:06:52,980 --> 03:06:54,220
I was not.

4482
03:06:54,360 --> 03:06:56,840
I think the poison hit hard there.

4483
03:06:57,400 --> 03:06:57,520
The...

4484
03:06:57,520 --> 03:06:58,000
The...

4485
03:06:58,000 --> 03:06:58,460
It was...

4486
03:06:58,460 --> 03:06:59,620
It was the poison guy.

4487
03:07:01,720 --> 03:07:03,300
I swear to God.

4488
03:07:03,580 --> 03:07:04,880
It was the poison.

4489
03:07:11,600 --> 03:07:13,580
Oh my god, let me grab this real quick.

4490
03:07:17,140 --> 03:07:19,140
Okay, how fucked is my jellyfish?

4491
03:07:19,260 --> 03:07:19,900
Oh, she's okay.

4492
03:07:21,960 --> 03:07:23,060
She's so healthy.

4493
03:07:23,780 --> 03:07:25,860
Oh my god, there you go.

4494
03:07:32,900 --> 03:07:33,380
Okay,

4495
03:07:38,200 --> 03:07:38,540
we're fine.

4496
03:07:38,880 --> 03:07:39,920
We're okay for now.

4497
03:07:45,140 --> 03:07:46,200
Wait, can I not?

4498
03:07:46,200 --> 03:07:50,120
Can I not do a backstab on this guy?

4499
03:07:50,260 --> 03:07:51,080
Is it because he's a ghost?

4500
03:07:51,520 --> 03:07:52,560
Why is it?

4501
03:07:53,800 --> 03:07:55,400
Oh, I... oh my god.

4502
03:07:55,540 --> 03:07:55,900
Oh, nice.

4503
03:07:56,560 --> 03:07:57,220
Got the crit.

4504
03:07:58,260 --> 03:08:00,740
I was gonna say, why can't I backstab the ghost?

4505
03:08:01,920 --> 03:08:03,420
Can ghost bleed?

4506
03:08:03,820 --> 03:08:05,360
Wait, that's a good question.

4507
03:08:05,900 --> 03:08:06,560
Oh, shit!

4508
03:08:07,060 --> 03:08:08,020
Oh, fuck!

4509
03:08:08,120 --> 03:08:09,480
I'm sorry, I'm fucking around too much!

4510
03:08:19,580 --> 03:08:20,620
Holy shit!

4511
03:08:24,200 --> 03:08:24,600
Wow!

4512
03:08:30,380 --> 03:08:31,840
Okay, that's cool.

4513
03:08:32,740 --> 03:08:34,780
What is the range?!

4514
03:08:34,780 --> 03:08:37,620
What is the range for your fucking weapon?!

4515
03:08:38,260 --> 03:08:39,120
Holy shit!

4516
03:08:39,340 --> 03:08:40,100
Oh my god!

4517
03:08:40,340 --> 03:08:41,820
You're not even real!

4518
03:08:42,260 --> 03:08:44,740
Oh my god, you're not even real!

4519
03:08:46,080 --> 03:08:46,760
Yes!

4520
03:08:48,040 --> 03:08:48,720
Yes!

4521
03:08:48,720 --> 03:08:48,780
Yes!

4522
03:08:48,780 --> 03:08:49,260
Holy shit!

4523
03:08:49,880 --> 03:08:50,580
Yeah, we did it!

4524
03:08:50,800 --> 03:08:50,980
Okay.

4525
03:08:51,880 --> 03:08:53,880
No, there are ranges!

4526
03:08:54,520 --> 03:08:54,740
Yes!

4527
03:08:56,680 --> 03:08:59,680
I didn't expect the real...

4528
03:08:59,680 --> 03:09:01,940
The real one.

4529
03:09:02,820 --> 03:09:03,640
Oh my god.

4530
03:09:03,860 --> 03:09:04,420
Okay, thank god.

4531
03:09:04,680 --> 03:09:04,860
Okay.

4532
03:09:07,140 --> 03:09:07,660
Okay.

4533
03:09:07,880 --> 03:09:08,400
We're good.

4534
03:09:08,780 --> 03:09:09,460
We're okay.

4535
03:09:09,680 --> 03:09:09,800
Alright.

4536
03:09:09,980 --> 03:09:10,260
You know what?

4537
03:09:10,320 --> 03:09:10,900
I'll call...

4538
03:09:10,900 --> 03:09:12,060
We're calling it here.

4539
03:09:12,540 --> 03:09:14,300
We have two streams today.

4540
03:09:14,720 --> 03:09:15,660
We're calling it...

4541
03:09:15,660 --> 03:09:16,180
That's a...

4542
03:09:16,180 --> 03:09:17,380
That's a story boss!

4543
03:09:17,480 --> 03:09:19,600
We did two story bosses, guys!

4544
03:09:20,240 --> 03:09:20,760
That's...

4545
03:09:20,760 --> 03:09:21,740
Holy shit!

4546
03:09:21,820 --> 03:09:22,700
And we got the low...

4547
03:09:22,700 --> 03:09:22,960
Okay.

4548
03:09:23,220 --> 03:09:24,020
That was good.

4549
03:09:24,400 --> 03:09:24,920
That's...

4550
03:09:27,340 --> 03:09:28,740
There's one more!

4551
03:09:28,740 --> 03:09:30,520
That's for next week, Doki.

4552
03:09:30,660 --> 03:09:31,900
They deal with...

4553
03:09:31,900 --> 03:09:32,500
That's...

4554
03:09:32,500 --> 03:09:34,620
We have a packed week this week.

4555
03:09:35,400 --> 03:09:35,900
Uh...

4556
03:09:35,900 --> 03:09:36,260
That...

4557
03:09:36,260 --> 03:09:37,340
We did two...

4558
03:09:37,340 --> 03:09:39,360
We technically did two story bosses.

4559
03:09:39,740 --> 03:09:40,100
Guys.

4560
03:09:40,480 --> 03:09:40,960
Technically.

4561
03:09:41,660 --> 03:09:41,820
Yeah.

4562
03:09:44,040 --> 03:09:44,540
Two...

4563
03:09:44,540 --> 03:09:46,340
Two whole story bosses.

4564
03:09:46,760 --> 03:09:48,040
Cindy, thank you for Super Chat.

4565
03:09:48,160 --> 03:09:48,860
Thank you, thank you.

4566
03:09:48,960 --> 03:09:50,020
Good job, Doki.

4567
03:09:50,180 --> 03:09:50,720
Two tries.

4568
03:09:50,940 --> 03:09:51,660
I'm so proud of you.

4569
03:09:51,760 --> 03:09:52,300
Thank you, guys.

4570
03:09:52,440 --> 03:09:52,900
Thank you, guys.

4571
03:09:53,020 --> 03:09:55,620
You guys saw how I first tried Tree Set all day?

4572
03:09:55,880 --> 03:09:56,880
Oh, man.

4573
03:09:57,280 --> 03:09:58,500
Those are good times.

4574
03:10:04,060 --> 03:10:05,020
Anyway, so...

4575
03:10:05,020 --> 03:10:06,380
Tonight, we're gonna have another stream tonight.

4576
03:10:06,500 --> 03:10:08,680
It's gonna be a sponsored stream with Mecha Break.

4577
03:10:09,000 --> 03:10:10,880
So, um...

4578
03:10:10,880 --> 03:10:11,220
Um...

4579
03:10:11,220 --> 03:10:13,460
You guys wanna support the stream and, uh...

4580
03:10:13,460 --> 03:10:15,500
Support the game and me, uh...

4581
03:10:16,060 --> 03:10:18,800
Come over on Twitch at 9pm PSC.

4582
03:10:18,860 --> 03:10:21,300
It's gonna be 9pm PSC on Twitch for Mecha Break.

4583
03:10:21,400 --> 03:10:23,160
And it's gonna be the Mecha Break launch, too.

4584
03:10:23,440 --> 03:10:25,540
Um, so you guys wanted to check out Mecha Break anyway.

4585
03:10:25,860 --> 03:10:28,000
Um, it is the launch day for it at 9pm.

4586
03:10:28,600 --> 03:10:28,960
PSC.

4587
03:10:29,920 --> 03:10:30,520
Hey, guys.

4588
03:10:30,980 --> 03:10:32,160
I'm gonna call it here.

4589
03:10:32,320 --> 03:10:34,180
Uh, because we're gonna do a second stream anyway.

4590
03:10:34,460 --> 03:10:35,160
And, uh...

4591
03:10:35,560 --> 03:10:36,040
Uh, you know.

4592
03:10:36,200 --> 03:10:37,960
We already did a long first stream on YouTube.

4593
03:10:38,260 --> 03:10:39,560
And we're gonna do another two...

4594
03:10:39,560 --> 03:10:41,120
At least two hour stream, uh, tonight.

4595
03:10:41,440 --> 03:10:41,880
Hey, guys.

4596
03:10:42,000 --> 03:10:42,820
As always, everybody.

4597
03:10:43,060 --> 03:10:43,900
Stay hydrated.

4598
03:10:45,180 --> 03:10:45,780
Pause your check.

4599
03:10:46,100 --> 03:10:47,620
Get up and move around to get that...

4600
03:10:47,620 --> 03:10:48,040
Oh my god.

4601
03:10:48,100 --> 03:10:49,860
Of course you guys message appraise me now.

4602
03:10:50,060 --> 03:10:51,100
You guys are like, It's time!

4603
03:10:51,400 --> 03:10:52,100
It's time!

4604
03:10:52,300 --> 03:10:52,740
She's...

4605
03:10:54,740 --> 03:10:57,200
We've withheld all these message appraise.

4606
03:10:57,460 --> 03:10:59,700
Now it's time to message...

4607
03:10:59,700 --> 03:11:01,460
I think she learned her lesson.

4608
03:11:01,460 --> 03:11:03,580
Now we can message appraise her.

4609
03:11:03,980 --> 03:11:04,540
Hey, guys.

4610
03:11:04,640 --> 03:11:05,680
As always, everybody.

4611
03:11:05,860 --> 03:11:06,740
Stay hydrated.

4612
03:11:07,120 --> 03:11:07,640
Pause your check.

4613
03:11:07,780 --> 03:11:09,620
