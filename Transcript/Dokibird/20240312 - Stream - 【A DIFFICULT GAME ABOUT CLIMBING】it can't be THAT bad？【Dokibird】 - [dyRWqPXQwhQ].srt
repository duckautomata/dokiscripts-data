1
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,400
Oh wait, wrong one.

2
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,880
Sorry!

3
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,220
Sorry, wrong screen.

4
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,620
Hello everybody!

5
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:03,880
Welcome!

6
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,480
Welcome!

7
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,340
I hope you guys had a nice rest day yesterday.

8
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,600
I sure did.

9
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,200
I slept so much.

10
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,080
Oh my gosh, I slept a lot.

11
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:19,740
Tomatoes!

12
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,880
Oh my god, look at all of you guys.

13
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,920
I can't believe it's been one month of memberships already.

14
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,040
That's actually crazy.

15
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,540
That's a really... I've been like streaming for a month now.

16
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:31,720
Oh my god.

17
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,560
Congratulations!

18
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,600
I have no other badges other than tomatoes, so...

19
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:42,460
And we won't be having other badges yet.

20
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,300
Okay?

21
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,580
The reason why is that...

22
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:52,360
I'm trying to like finalize some stuff right now regarding like my new skin suit.

23
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:56,360
So like that is why we don't have a badge after the tomato.

24
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,440
Because I'm trying to like figure out what I want to do.

25
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:03,680
What I want to do for my badges at the moment.

26
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,340
Most likely it will be dragoon themed as always.

27
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,240
But then like I'm like trying to figure out for...

28
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:15,260
Like after... because like you know after the dragoon badges like what's after that?

29
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,780
I don't know what's after that.

30
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,680
So that's why...

31
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,560
That's why there's no badges other than the tomato badge for now.

32
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,280
We're trying to do everything.

33
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,360
There's so many things I have to do.

34
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,280
Anyway!

35
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,160
I love how like this game has like a rage quit option too.

36
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,600
That makes sense.

37
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,360
That makes sense for the type of game that we're playing today.

38
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,840
For those who are wondering, wow Doki, what game are you playing today?

39
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,780
It's called A Difficult Game About Clash of Clans.

40
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,120
It's a game that's like a rock climbing.

41
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,700
It's not by the creators of getting over it.

42
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:57,280
It is like a spiritual successor to getting over it by some different person.

43
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,660
Instead of you know a pot and a sledgehammer, we're gonna be rock climbing.

44
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,480
And like okay, I usually never touch these types of games.

45
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:11,040
But I also had a perfectly good excuse to not touch these types of games.

46
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,200
One of them was that like I could be like...

47
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,140
Ooh, I don't know guys.

48
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:17,580
Permissu.

49
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,580
But now, I don't really have that anymore.

50
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,620
So like now, I get to feel the FOMO.

51
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,980
The fear of missing out.

52
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:34,720
You know, because like it just came out and everybody is playing it now.

53
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,620
All the streamers are playing it.

54
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,180
So like no!

55
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,680
Now I have FOMO!

56
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,420
I can't use the excuse anymore!

57
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,080
Because then I could be like...

58
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,580
Well guys, the game came out a long time ago.

59
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,540
And like I don't want to put myself through that.

60
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,680
I don't want to put myself through that.

61
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,180
Because I know it's a really... it's a rage game.

62
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,400
It's a game that's making you supposed to be raging.

63
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,820
The game just came out.

64
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,320
This game... this game just came out.

65
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,400
So now I don't have any excuse.

66
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,740
Because it's the streamer game now.

67
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,520
And now I'm feeling the FOMO.

68
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,400
I'm feeling it guys.

69
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,540
I'm feeling the fear of missing out.

70
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,960
I don't have any excuses anymore.

71
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,920
I'm weak to FOMO.

72
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:18,900
I...

73
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,220
It's the meta stream game.

74
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,160
I need to follow the meta.

75
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,160
I'm always following the meta.

76
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,340
No!

77
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,540
I'm really feeling the FOMO at the moment.

78
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,860
I'm feeling it.

79
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,600
Okay, also like we're going to have some background music.

80
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,600
Because like this game is like...

81
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,460
It's like water.

82
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,460
You hear...

83
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,600
You hear water.

84
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,480
So let me just...

85
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,940
Let me put like a BGM.

86
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,400
Just to be a little sane.

87
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,980
Ba-ba-bum.

88
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,180
Ba-dum-ba-dum.

89
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,600
I don't know if you guys can hear that.

90
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,600
That might be a bit too quiet.

91
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,100
Alright, here we go.

92
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,940
Alright, so...

93
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,440
The goal...

94
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,960
Is to climb.

95
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,340
Okay, I don't know the game is too loud.

96
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,340
Let me check.

97
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,480
Alright.

98
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,720
Okay, and then we do this.

99
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,620
And then...

100
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,880
How do I...

101
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,980
And then I grab like...

102
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,060
Oh!

103
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,840
Wait!

104
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,940
This is so easy!

105
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,140
What the fuck?

106
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,340
What's so difficult about climbing?

107
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,400
I don't understand.

108
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,760
What can be so difficult about this?

109
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:29,740
Okay, wait.

110
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,280
Wait.

111
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,220
Okay, wait.

112
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:33,700
Wait.

113
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,580
Wait, I can feel...

114
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,660
Wait, now...

115
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:38,500
Wait, sorry.

116
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,860
I think I know now.

117
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,440
I think...

118
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,520
Okay, wait.

119
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,880
Wait, I think...

120
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,040
No!

121
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:44,540
No!

122
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,360
I don't!

123
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:45,580
No!

124
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,040
Wait, wait, wait!

125
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,280
Wait, wait.

126
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:47,920
I think...

127
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,160
I think I understand now.

128
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,480
I think I understand what could be so difficult about...

129
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,740
A difficult game about climbing.

130
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:54,760
What?

131
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,940
What's your weak ass hand doing?

132
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,360
Is it...

133
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:00,460
Oh!

134
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,360
It's cause this water is...

135
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,100
This is a shaky rock.

136
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,360
Cause it's like water...

137
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:06,580
Oh!

138
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,000
Guys, I'm learning.

139
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:08,480
I'm learning.

140
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,360
I'm learning.

141
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,460
It's a shaky rock.

142
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,760
Okay, now this is the easiest fucking game I've ever played.

143
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,380
Ba-ba-dum!

144
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,160
Okay.

145
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,780
Can I grab...

146
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,980
Can I grab can?

147
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,180
I can.

148
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:21,820
Okay.

149
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,640
I mean, the controls are very intuitive.

150
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,220
Like, it's not...

151
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,160
I swear to God.

152
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:28,920
Can I grab the side?

153
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,120
Yeah, okay.

154
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,320
Alright.

155
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,500
It's not...

156
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,500
You know, it's not that stupid.

157
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,260
Okay, I need to remember what you...

158
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:36,700
What?

159
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,060
No!

160
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:38,460
What?

161
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:39,860
No!

162
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,340
I can just swim away.

163
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,600
I can't believe it.

164
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,800
Okay, now I know.

165
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,480
Now I can feel it.

166
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,400
No!

167
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,040
Guys, now I understand.

168
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,360
I understand now.

169
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,540
I don't understand!

170
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,540
Why couldn't you climb?

171
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,040
Okay.

172
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,440
Alright.

173
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,500
At least, like, I died there.

174
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,100
You know?

175
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,680
It's not that bad.

176
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,140
Boom.

177
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:09,420
Boom.

178
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:10,500
Boom.

179
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,300
Boom.

180
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:11,780
Boom.

181
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:13,420
Boom.

182
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:13,660
Boom.

183
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,060
Boom.

184
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:14,180
Boom.

185
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:14,720
Boom.

186
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:14,900
Boom.

187
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,140
Boom.

188
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:15,860
All right.

189
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,300
Here we go.

190
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,360
Up and then... climb?

191
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,320
There we go.

192
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,260
I got this down.

193
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,740
I mean, this is...

194
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,600
Honestly, the controls for this?

195
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,360
It's...

196
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,320
I'll say it.

197
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,760
It's easier than getting over it.

198
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,620
It is 100% easier than getting over it.

199
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,160
It's, like, so intuitive.

200
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,400
Like...

201
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,920
Even a fucking child can do this.

202
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,920
Now I need to figure out how to get over there.

203
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,740
Okay, come on.

204
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,360
Use your upper body strength.

205
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:47,820
Come on!

206
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:48,920
Come on!

207
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:50,620
Yes!

208
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,120
Your arm can go further!

209
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,120
Yes, okay.

210
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,220
Oh, thank god.

211
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:54,440
Okay.

212
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,960
Okay, we're good.

213
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,500
We're good.

214
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,500
We're good.

215
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,260
He stretched himself.

216
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,940
Alright, and then we're gonna climb this fucking bark.

217
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:03,760
Okay.

218
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,000
That's good.

219
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,740
Alright, where the fuck do I go from there?

220
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,840
I don't know.

221
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,940
Okay, we're gonna grab...

222
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,200
We're gonna...

223
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,820
Please.

224
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,900
Okay, this...

225
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,300
I hate this BGM.

226
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,820
I might have chose, like, the fucking worst BGM ever.

227
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,100
Okay.

228
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,200
Please.

229
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,520
There we go.

230
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,060
There we go.

231
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:31,360
We're fine.

232
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:31,740
We're fine.

233
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,280
Okay.

234
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,940
Where the fuck do I go?

235
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,620
Where do I go?

236
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:37,940
Okay.

237
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,760
Oh no.

238
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,540
No, no, no, no, no!

239
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,100
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

240
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,640
No!

241
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,750
I don't understand!

242
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,450
Why can't he use his legs?

243
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,350
Is he stupid?

244
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,550
Like...

245
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,550
I don't understand!

246
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:00,850
Why do I lose my grip there and not the other way around?

247
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:02,810
I need... the sense needs to be higher.

248
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:03,790
I can't.

249
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:04,730
I can't.

250
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:07,050
Is he fucking stupid?

251
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,730
Why can't he fucking grip that?

252
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:11,770
Okay.

253
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:12,810
Okay.

254
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,090
Alright.

255
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:15,590
Okay.

256
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:17,350
I can speedrun this part.

257
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,010
Okay.

258
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,570
No!

259
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,690
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

260
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:21,330
Alright.

261
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:25,090
Okay, we're fine.

262
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:26,430
We're fine.

263
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:27,930
We're fine.

264
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,550
Please.

265
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:30,690
Please!

266
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,150
Just grip it!

267
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,230
Just grip it!

268
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,730
I don't understand why you're weak to water!

269
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:41,410
Okay.

270
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:42,370
It's okay.

271
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,070
We're good.

272
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,810
We can speedrun this part.

273
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,650
Like, this part is easy.

274
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:47,310
Oh!

275
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:49,930
Don't go too fast!

276
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,190
Don't go too fast!

277
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:53,230
Okay.

278
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:54,350
Nice.

279
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,950
I'm speedrunning this part.

280
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:56,850
Okay.

281
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:57,910
Yes!

282
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:58,270
Okay.

283
00:11:58,910 --> 00:11:59,430
Alright.

284
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:00,250
We're good.

285
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:00,650
We're good.

286
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:01,050
We're good.

287
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:01,430
We're good.

288
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,110
We're good.

289
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:02,850
We're good.

290
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:04,730
Okay.

291
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:05,350
Okay.

292
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:05,730
Okay.

293
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:06,750
What do we do here, though?

294
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:09,170
What do we do here, though?

295
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,750
What do we do here, though?

296
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:12,550
I don't know.

297
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,330
Do I... Do I...

298
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:15,870
Okay.

299
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:16,910
I gripped that.

300
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,270
And I gripped the box.

301
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:19,790
Okay.

302
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:20,810
Come on.

303
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:21,830
Yes!

304
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,730
Go higher.

305
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,850
Higher than you've ever gone before, Mr. Man.

306
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:27,210
Okay.

307
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,230
Alright.

308
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:29,970
Oh!

309
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:30,410
Oh!

310
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:30,650
Oh!

311
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:30,930
Oh!

312
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:31,990
I'm up!

313
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,750
You know, this game is pretty easy, actually.

314
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:35,990
Okay.

315
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,050
If I just keep...

316
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,570
Oh, I can grip bushes!

317
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,070
Wait, that's new information!

318
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:44,530
Okay.

319
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,050
Okay, okay, okay.

320
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,890
Just keep gripping the bushes.

321
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:48,870
Yes.

322
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,090
And up I go!

323
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:50,810
Yes!

324
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,070
Up you go, sir!

325
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:53,530
Nice!

326
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:54,810
Wait, what?

327
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:56,410
What do I do?

328
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:57,710
What do I do?

329
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:58,990
Wait.

330
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,950
What do I do from here?

331
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,270
Down?

332
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:03,130
What?

333
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,990
I don't want to go down!

334
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,990
I worked so hard to get here!

335
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:08,510
Wait, what?

336
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,310
No!

337
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:13,030
Don't make me go down!

338
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,530
The leap of faith.

339
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:15,850
Okay.

340
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:16,750
Here we go.

341
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,270
No!

342
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,270
No!

343
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,180
Why did I listen?

344
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,080
Why did I listen to you guys?

345
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:31,680
Okay.

346
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,480
So, is the BGM too loud or is it good?

347
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,600
No!

348
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,620
Why did I go down?

349
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,120
It was too much pain.

350
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:43,740
Too...

351
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:44,780
Not...

352
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,960
Doki, not that down.

353
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,900
The other down.

354
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,040
Oh, shit.

355
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:49,780
It's too quiet?

356
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:50,320
Okay.

357
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,780
I didn't realize it was too quiet.

358
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,260
I've been listening to the sound...

359
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,280
This BGM, like, blasted up to my ears.

360
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,920
Did you guys hear that?

361
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:00,560
Okay.

362
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,580
I'll turn it up a little.

363
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:02,660
Over now.

364
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:04,560
Alright.

365
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,640
Oh, God.

366
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:07,080
Okay.

367
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,380
Alright.

368
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:08,880
It's fine.

369
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,420
It's fine.

370
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:09,980
We're fine.

371
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,500
Like, I'm starting getting better at this.

372
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,520
No!

373
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:14,680
No!

374
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:16,900
No!

375
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:20,500
No!

376
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:20,760
No!

377
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,380
No!

378
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,260
No!

379
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:23,860
No!

380
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,400
No!

381
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,280
It's not that difficult.

382
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,800
I would say this is easier than getting over it.

383
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:35,720
100%.

384
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,480
See, look at me.

385
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,820
I can, like, speedrun this.

386
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:39,580
Let me...

387
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,700
Maybe I should watch a speedrun.

388
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,420
Shout out to the highest working link cop ever.

389
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,840
Pass the point.

390
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,840
Thank you for the super chat.

391
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:47,280
Thank you.

392
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:47,840
Thank you.

393
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,180
Okay.

394
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,520
If I, like, do this and then...

395
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:50,900
Yes.

396
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,240
Okay.

397
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:52,460
Okay.

398
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,320
You just keep climbing.

399
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,000
You won't let this...

400
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:56,980
Okay.

401
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,320
Nice.

402
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:57,960
Push.

403
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,000
Push.

404
00:14:59,020 --> 00:14:59,380
Push.

405
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,200
Good job, push.

406
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,240
Okay.

407
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,600
Come on.

408
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,320
Come on.

409
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,000
Come on.

410
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,920
You got this.

411
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:05,980
Come on, sir.

412
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,540
Come on, sir.

413
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:07,840
No!

414
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,280
Don't let water destroy you!

415
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,320
It's just water!

416
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:12,780
Oh.

417
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,140
Oh.

418
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,640
Okay.

419
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:14,420
Alright.

420
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,480
It's okay.

421
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:16,780
It's okay.

422
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,320
Keep climbing!

423
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,000
Just keep climbing!

424
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,400
Scratch and break your nails!

425
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,200
Okay.

426
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,180
Alright.

427
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,060
Alright.

428
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:24,580
We're fine.

429
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:24,960
Okay.

430
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:25,520
Here we go.

431
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:26,660
Alright.

432
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,540
And then...

433
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:27,820
Okay.

434
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:28,580
No.

435
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:33,920
We're gonna use that to boost our momentum and go...

436
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,400
Wait.

437
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,400
What the fuck?

438
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,040
How did you lose your grip?

439
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,640
How did you lose your grip?

440
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,360
There you go.

441
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,520
Nice.

442
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,540
I figured it out.

443
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,560
I figured out the system.

444
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,280
And then we grab this.

445
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:48,940
Oh, God.

446
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:49,640
This is scary.

447
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:50,680
No!

448
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,060
No!

449
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,240
No!

450
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:51,380
No!

451
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:51,600
No!

452
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:51,800
No!

453
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,080
No!

454
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:52,840
No!

455
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:53,600
No!

456
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,140
No, no, no, no!

457
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,260
No!

458
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:56,660
No!

459
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:57,400
No!

460
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,160
Ahhh!

461
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:02,880
Why?

462
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,660
I'm in a game of controller.

463
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:08,840
Okay.

464
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,000
Up.

465
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:10,700
Higher.

466
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,740
The sensitivity must be higher!

467
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,160
Okay.

468
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:21,160
Honestly, I think it's like, you max out the senses, the way to go, honestly, at this point.

469
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:21,280
Wait.

470
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,100
Alright.

471
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,200
Okay.

472
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:23,900
Nice.

473
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,240
Nice.

474
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,500
We got this one down.

475
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:27,740
Alright.

476
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:32,320
And then... I don't understand why my grip will sometimes get fucked.

477
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,860
I don't understand.

478
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,280
Okay.

479
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:35,420
Okay.

480
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:37,760
Alright.

481
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,480
And then we just keep... Boost!

482
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,340
Alright.

483
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,460
And then we grab this.

484
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,560
And then... Okay.

485
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:46,340
Okay.

486
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:48,520
Boost!

487
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:48,980
Nice.

488
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:49,940
Okay.

489
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,180
Okay.

490
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:50,540
Here we go.

491
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,160
This is the way.

492
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:51,940
Boost!

493
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,220
Sir!

494
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,160
Pull up!

495
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,440
Pull up!

496
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,260
Okay.

497
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,000
Okay.

498
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,560
Here we try again.

499
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,100
Pull up!

500
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:58,760
There you go.

501
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,660
I'm like... Honestly...

502
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,320
There might be a time where I pull out the controller.

503
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,940
I feel like...

504
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,420
A controller might be easier to handle.

505
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,400
Alright.

506
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:15,840
Here we go.

507
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:16,660
Okay.

508
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:20,300
I want to grab the other hand.

509
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,120
Alright.

510
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:22,960
Nice.

511
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:23,300
Okay.

512
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,460
I didn't grab the tree branch there.

513
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:26,340
Alright.

514
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:26,780
Here we go.

515
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,380
Bush!

516
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:30,500
Okay.

517
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,060
Okay.

518
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:31,540
No.

519
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:31,780
No.

520
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:31,920
No.

521
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,660
That's not a bush.

522
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:33,800
Okay.

523
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,760
We need to grab...

524
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,260
We need to grab...

525
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,320
We need to grab the grass.

526
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,520
Grab the grass, sir.

527
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,200
Okay.

528
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,120
Okay.

529
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:40,820
Here we go.

530
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,880
And we need to grab a higher upper of the grass.

531
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:44,180
Okay.

532
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:44,560
One.

533
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:45,340
Two.

534
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,060
Three!

535
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:46,920
Yes!

536
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,240
Good job!

537
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,320
Alright.

538
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,440
This part...

539
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,040
I don't know.

540
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:53,920
I don't know.

541
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,420
Do I just swing?

542
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,100
What?

543
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,560
Okay.

544
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:00,200
I swing.

545
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:00,920
Okay.

546
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:01,960
Okay.

547
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,380
That was scary.

548
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,020
That was a little scary.

549
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,100
Okay.

550
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm gonna use bones now, too.

551
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,320
Alright.

552
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,960
What do I do here?

553
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,400
Do I...

554
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,420
Do I swing?

555
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,960
Oh, I don't like this.

556
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,660
I don't like this!

557
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,360
Do I...

558
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,320
No!

559
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:18,640
No!

560
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:18,820
No!

561
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,000
No!

562
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,400
That's a bad idea!

563
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,300
That's a bad idea!

564
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,580
That's a bad idea!

565
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,120
I don't...

566
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,600
I'm so scared!

567
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,320
Bone!

568
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:29,800
Bone!

569
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,020
Okay.

570
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,540
Do I go down?

571
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,540
Do I...

572
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:40,900
No?

573
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,100
Go up?

574
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,680
Where?

575
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,760
Where go?

576
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,680
Where do I climb?

577
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,300
Okay.

578
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,560
Poe not good?

579
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,060
It's true!

580
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,240
I hate FOMO.

581
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,280
Backseaters!

582
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,420
This is your time to shine!

583
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:01,500
No!

584
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:04,980
No!

585
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,480
No!

586
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,680
Do I swing?

587
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,380
Damn you FOMO!

588
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,480
But the bone zone...

589
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,220
Damn you FOMO!

590
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,660
Why are Rage Games streamer games?

591
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,160
God damn it.

592
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,680
I wish I was a game programmer so I can make Rage Games.

593
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,900
Hey guys!

594
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,020

599
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:39,680
Exexpect... Yeah.

600
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:40,840
Yeah.

601
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,740
I... I figured it out.

602
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:43,180
Yeah.

603
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:44,640
Yeah!

604
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,760
Figured it out.

605
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,260
Thank you for the Akasupa.

606
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:50,960
Thank you.

607
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,480
Thank you.

608
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:52,680
Okay.

609
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:54,840
Alright.

610
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,260
Here we go.

611
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,120
Nice.

612
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:57,740
Alright.

613
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:58,640
Oh yeah.

614
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,260
I forgot how's the sound by the way.

615
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,480
I forgot to ask you guys how you think about the sound.

616
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,060
If it's too loud or if it's perfect.

617
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,300
Alright.

618
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,900
At least I got this part down.

619
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,560
Like this part is fucking easy.

620
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,940
This part is for fucking babies.

621
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,280
Which is soft.

622
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,160
The game sound or... Okay.

623
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,460
Do you really need to know about like... Do you really need to know the game sound of this man?

624
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,540
All he's doing... Oh my god.

625
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,800
All he's doing is just grunting.

626
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,380
Like in the water.

627
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,880
Like that's all he's doing.

628
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,900
He's just grunting.

629
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,380
So you guys don't... You're not missing out.

630
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,960
You're not missing out right now.

631
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:44,940
Don't worry.

632
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,500
There's no FOMO to be had here.

633
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,380
Okay.

634
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:47,860
Here we go.

635
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,200
The grunting is important.

636
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,980
Don't understand Doki.

637
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:57,000
We need to hear this man go...

638
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,240
It's important!

639
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,340
Okay.

640
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:06,380
Okay.

641
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:06,780
Here we go.

642
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,480
Here we go.

643
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,300
There.

644
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,860
I'll voice act it for you guys.

645
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,980
It might just be the same.

646
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:12,780
Here.

647
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:14,420
Here.

648
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,100
Please.

649
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,700
Please grab onto this.

650
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,240
Okay.

651
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:28,660
Okay.

652
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,000

657
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:35,440
Okay.

658
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:35,760
Nice.

659
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,080
Alright.

660
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:36,640
We got the boost.

661
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:37,580
Okay.

662
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,080
We need to pick this up.

663
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:39,800
And then...

664
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,140
Okay.

665
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,000

There we go.

669
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:46,800
Nice.

670
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,380
And then... Yes!

671
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,320
Okay.

672
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:54,560
I need to grab... I need to grab this side.

673
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:55,540
No.

674
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,580
It's not what I want.

675
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:57,900
Okay.

676
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,200
One.

677
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:58,780
Two.

678
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:58,780
Three.

679
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,720
Nice.

00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,760
We got it.

681
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:02,660
Okay.

682
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,280
We got this down.

683
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,560
This part is super easy.

684
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,660
This part is like really easy for me.

685
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,800
The scariest part is the dropping down because like I don't have faith in anything.

686
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,100
Okay.

687
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:14,580
One.

688
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,360

00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:16,860
Nice.

691
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:17,080
Okay.

692
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,020
Alright.

693
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,060
We gotta fall now.

694
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,120
I don't wanna fall.

695
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:20,840
I don't...

696
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,200
One.

697
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:22,680
Two.

698
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:23,600
Three!

699
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,160
Okay.

700
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,760
Don't worry.

701
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,160
What is... I hate this stuff.

702
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:31,920
Okay.

703
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:32,820
Okay.

704
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:33,440
Here we go.

705
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,520
Where do I go from here?

706
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,660
I don't understand.

707
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,920
Where do I...

708
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,900
Where do I...

709
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,600
Do I swing?

710
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,960
There's no way.

711
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,980
There's no way I can make it.

712
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,000
Do I make it?

713
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:51,800
No!

714
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,160
Full swing?

715
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,660
Okay.

716
00:22:59,060 --> 00:22:59,660
One.

717
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,260
Okay.

718
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:00,740
I'm scared.

719
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,160
Guys.

720
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:01,500
Guys.

721
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:01,960
I'm scared.

722
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,520
I am so scared.

723
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,520
I am so scared.

724
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,780
The sign?

725
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,800
What sign?

726
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,200
Okay.

727
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,800
Full swing?

728
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,180
What if we don't make it?

729
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,440
Higher up?

730
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,080
Here?

731
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,300
We go?

732
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:20,780
Higher?

733
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,620
But like... That's where I came from!

734
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,840
What do you mean?

735
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,620
Aim for the side.

736
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,340
But how?

737
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:32,660
Okay.

738
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,720
Go high.

739
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:34,840
And then...

740
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,680
Okay.

741
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:36,800
No.

742
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,480
You're too far.

743
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,200
Guys.

744
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:38,720
I'm scared.

745
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,640
I'm scared.

746
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:41,540
Okay.

747
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,180
One.

748
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,260
Oh god.

749
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:43,780
Oh god.

750
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,020
This is where it gets difficult.

751
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,680
We're already down?

752
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:48,780
Okay.

753
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,160
One.

754
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:50,880
Two!

755
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,300
No!

756
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:53,440
No!

757
00:23:58,910 --> 00:23:59,590
What?

758
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:02,940
Grab the bone.

759
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,760
Swing for the side.

760
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:05,420
Okay.

761
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,880
I just need to grab the bone.

762
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:08,500
Alright.

763
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,360
Grab the bone.

764
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,100
Okay.

765
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,700
Grab the bone.

766
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,120
What's the world record currently?

767
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,740
What even is the current world record?

768
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,300
For this game?

769
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:21,860
Like...

770
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,880
Well...

771
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,000
Okay.

772
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,180
Okay.

773
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,620
SEVEN FUCKING MINUTES?!

774
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,200
BRO!

775
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,420
What are you doing?!

776
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,920
What are you doing?!

777
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,140
What are you doing, Doki?!

778
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,160
Okay.

779
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,040
Alright, here we go.

780
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:45,840
Well, at least I'm like, feeling this game now.

781
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,120
I'm feeling it.

782
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,280
I'm feeling this game now.

783
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,900
I don't even need to do the boost.

784
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:55,980
I can just like... I can just do regular bounces.

785
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,300
Now I need to do the boost though.

786
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,520
Here we go.

787
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,000
Up.

788
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,480
Up I go.

789
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,660
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

790
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,680
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Doki.

791
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:06,940
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

792
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,200
Okay.

793
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,680
I need to do this arm.

794
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,220
Okay.

795
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,240
No, no, no, no, no, no.

796
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,220
Okay.

797
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,020
No, no, no, no, no, no.

798
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,720
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

799
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:18,360
Okay.

800
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:19,600
One.

801
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:20,200
Two.

802
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:20,560
Three.

803
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,460
Don't fall, don't fall, don't fall.

804
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:23,760
Okay.

805
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,140
Don't fall.

806
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,980
Okay, we got this part down.

807
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,420
We just need to start.

808
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,280
We just need to...

809
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,520
Where's your other... no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

810
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,100
Where's your other car?

811
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:36,420
I'm going.

812
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,320
Where's your other car?

813
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:37,580
I'm going.

814
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,380
Where is it going?

815
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,100
All right, nice.

816
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:41,900
No!

817
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:42,460
No!

818
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,340
No!

819
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,960
Why did the bush fail me?

820
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,380
Why is the bush failing me?

821
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,040
I fucking hate the water!

822
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,600
Okay, I'm good.

823
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,240
I'm okay.

824
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,240
I need to turn down the BGM.

825
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,820
The BGM is pissing me off.

826
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,300
Why are you so stupid?

827
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,720
Use your fucking legs!

828
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,180
I don't understand.

829
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:16,480
Okay.

830
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,960
It's only been 26 minutes.

831
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,600
I swear I feel like I've been playing this game for an hour already.

832
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,960
I hate FOMO.

833
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,800
Okay, here we go.

834
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:30,520
I swear, it feels like I've been playing for like...

835
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:31,800
hours.

836
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:35,540
I feel like I've just like witnessed everything in life.

837
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,320
Okay, let's see.

838
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,840
All right, nice.

839
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,740
We grab that and then we grab this.

840
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,060
And then...

841
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,080
Okay.

842
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,600
I can't...

843
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:47,980
Swing!

844
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,160
There we go.

845
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,180
All right.

846
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:51,780
Swing!

847
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,240
There we go.

848
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:53,480
All right.

849
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,020
Swing!

850
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:55,160
Swing!

851
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:55,780
You're gonna hit it.

852
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,240
Yeah.

853
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:56,940
Here we go.

854
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:57,720
One...

855
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,380
Two...

856
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:00,420
Three.

857
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:00,740
Okay.

858
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,180
All right.

859
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,180
Okay.

860
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,820
One, two, three!

861
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:06,620
Nice.

862
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,900
We grab that.

863
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,940
Like this part is like super easy now.

864
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,400
But like...

865
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,320
Oh my god.

866
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,800
As I get higher and higher...

867
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,660
Holy shit!

868
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,320
By the way, guys.

869
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,120
I was like talking to the Minecraft team.

870
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:19,920
The people who are...

871
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,860
For those who are gonna be members, if you guys don't know.

872
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,960
We're gonna be creating a members of Minecraft community.

873
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,500
Community server.

874
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:28,500
I was talking to like the Minecraft team.

875
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,520
And we're like talking about like faction...

876
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,280
Making factions and stuff.

877
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,980
So like basically...

878
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:34,380
Okay.

879
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:34,560
Wait.

880
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,340
Give me a sec, guys.

881
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:35,620
Sorry.

882
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,640
You're gonna be on a cliffhanger because I need to get to the other fucking side.

883
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,140
Give me a sec.

884
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,060
Swing!

885
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:40,880
Okay.

886
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:41,360
Okay.

887
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:41,620
Okay.

888
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:41,900
Anyway.

889
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,480
As I was saying...

890
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,220
So thank you for the machete.

891
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:46,580
Super.

892
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,040
Thank you.

893
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:47,600
Thank you.

894
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,820
Doki is a pro climber.

895
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:49,480
Expected.

896
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,060
Thank you.

897
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:50,620
All right.

898
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,720
So like the most exciting part is that we're talking about how to do the faction stuff.

899
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,880
And like basically like...

900
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:57,900
Oh.

901
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:58,340
Oh.

902
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:58,800
Oh.

903
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,220
Okay.

904
00:27:59,340 --> 00:27:59,580
Sorry.

905
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,720
I had to...

906
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,060
Okay.

907
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,800
Basically, it's gonna be when you enter the town.

908
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,400
When you enter the lobby, the pre-made town.

909
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,000
You get to pick your faction.

910
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:18,240
So like obviously the faction is gonna be divided by like long goon, chunky goon, egg goon, and like regular goon.

911
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,660
And like...

912
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,420
And then like...

913
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,480
There's gonna be like power levels.

914
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,840
And like the stronger your faction is, the more land you can claim.

915
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,980
So technically you could be like...

916
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:33,160
You can like wage wars against other dragoons.

917
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,200
For more land.

918
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,440
And like...

919
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,180
And like there's gonna be like a communal bank system or something.

920
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,160
And...

921
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,880
So like the more...

922
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,280
The more dragoon types you kill...

923
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,940
Like the more enemy dragoons you kill, the more land you can claim.

924
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:56,540
Like like...

925
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:57,720
So...

926
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,520
I was like talking to like the Minecraft team about that.

927
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:05,620
So...

928
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,400
Alright.

929
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:06,940
Here we go.

930
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,400
Let's see.

931
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,840
I need to figure out how to swing.

932
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,340
Which is the best area to swing from?

933
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,040
Like do I go higher?

934
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:14,460
Or...

935
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,180
Haha.

936
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,100
I don't get it.

937
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,200
Do I go higher?

938
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,580
Do I swing from the bone?

939
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,140
I thought I can't touch the bone.

940
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,300
Bone!

941
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:24,320
Okay.

942
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,160
The bone is... yeah, the bone is slippery!

943
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,580
What do you mean?

944
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,440
Okay.

945
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,180
Bone bad!

946
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,120
Bone bad!

947
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,640
Everything changed with the Nes-tical faction attack.

948
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,780
Thank you for the super chat.

949
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,860
Thank you, thank you.

950
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,660
Okay, closer to a sign.

951
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,260
Let me know.

952
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,160
Do hot and cold.

953
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:45,820
Am I hot?

954
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,140
Sorry.

955
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,740
Am I close to the thing?

956
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:55,160
Am I cold or hot to the area?

957
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,240
Okay.

958
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,420
A bit higher area.

959
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,840
A bit higher here?

960
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,400
Is that it?

961
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,600
Is that it?

962
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,820
Am I at the swing?

963
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,860
The optimal swing?

964
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:10,960
Guys, okay.

965
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,240
I need to know this is important, guys.

966
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,300
Am I at the optimal swing?

967
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,800
A bit higher?

968
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,000
Here?

969
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:24,620
Here?

970
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,480
Oh, God.

971
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,840
Oh, God.

972
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:29,540
No!

973
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,480
Where?

974
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,800
Too high?

975
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,160
Okay, here.

976
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,000
Here.

977
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:37,560
Is this it?

978
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,300
Is this it?

979
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,540
Is this the optimal swing?

980
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,060
Is this the optimal swing?

981
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:45,500
Cold!

982
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:46,460
Cold or hot?

983
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,180
I'm not gonna wing it!

984
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:51,800
Lower?

985
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:52,800
Okay.

986
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,360
Okay, here.

987
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,360
Okay.

988
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,080
Is this optimal swing?

989
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,600
Is this optimal swing?

990
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,500
I swear to God.

991
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:07,600
I will pull up the fucking speedrun of this just to figure out which is the optimal swing.

992
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:11,840
Okay.

993
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:13,840
Okay.

994
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,080
What?

995
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:15,780
No!

996
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,300
No!

997
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:19,780
No!

998
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:21,720
No!

999
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,240
I'm fucking pulling up the vine.

1000
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,460
Give me a sec.

1001
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:35,520
Difficult game about climbing speedrun.

1002
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,860
I'm pulling up.

1003
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:37,840
I'm fucking...

1004
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,760
Alright, 7.55.

1005
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:40,900
What the fuck?

1006
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,980
It goes to a... Why is it purple?

1007
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,300
Okay.

1008
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,720
What the fuck?

1009
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:47,820
Guys!

1010
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,140
Okay.

1011
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,500
I blame you guys.

1012
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,560
This could have been so much easier.

1013
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:02,920
Guys, I can't believe you made this harder than I expected.

1014
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,020
I can't believe it.

1015
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:05,280
Alright.

1016
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,320
I should have just...

1017
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,740
I should have just fucking watched a professional.

1018
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:09,800
I see.

1019
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,900
Yeah, why is he purple now?

1020
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,760
Alright, here you go.

1021
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,300
I can't believe it, guys.

1022
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,700
My Oshii matpack graduated.

1023
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,360
Like...

1024
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,600
Was it yesterday?

1025
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:22,340
I don't even remember.

1026
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,140
Guys, he's my Oshii, but I don't even remember.

1027
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,380
I can't believe it!

1028
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,180
Biggest graduation stream I've ever seen!

1029
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,660
Alright, here you go.

1030
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:36,880
Sad.

1031
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,320
I can't believe it.

1032
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:45,620
I like how he made... I watched a little bit because I was curious, like, what his last video was gonna be.

1033
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,900
And then, like, I love how, like, he...

1034
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,480
He, like, announced a website and it literally crashed in one second.

1035
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,640
Like, I thought... I was like, is this a virus?

1036
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,220
Because I was like, what is this website?

1037
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,420
And then, like, what the fuck?

1038
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,320
It literally crashed the moment it was posted.

1039
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:00,640
Okay.

1040
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,600
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1041
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:03,860
Okay.

1042
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,000
There you go.

1043
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:06,340
Nice.

1044
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,380
Alright, we're good.

1045
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,580
We're good.

1046
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:09,800
This is fine.

1047
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,000
This part I got hands down.

1048
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:12,360
Oh.

1049
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,120
Except for that part.

1050
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,840
This part I got, like, easily.

1051
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:17,680
Alright.

1052
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,900
Oh, seven to our Oshii MatPat.

1053
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:26,980
Now, who am I gonna go to for all the wacky FNAF theories?

1054
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,000
Alright.

1055
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:34,960
It's funny though to see him, like, call out Scott for, like, stealing his theories.

1056
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,180
But Scott literally made him.

1057
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,980
The creator of FNAF blu...

1058
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,480
Like, his... his... like, yeah, his videos were popular.

1059
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,560
But, like, FNAF made him for who he is.

1060
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,020
Okay.

1061
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:52,940
Let's see.

1062
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:53,660
Here we go.

1063
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,580
What the fuck?

1064
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:56,820
Okay.

1065
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,320
That is, like, so scary though.

1066
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,460
Every time...

1067
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,380
Every time doing that leap of faith...

1068
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:02,980
Okay.

1069
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:03,740
It's, like, here.

1070
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,180
This is the... the spot.

1071
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,640
The optimal swing spot.

1072
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:07,980
And then you go like this.

1073
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,260
Okay.

1074
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,120
Wait.

1075
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:10,700
Wait.

1076
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:11,220
And then...

1077
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,080
Oh my god.

1078
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:12,720
This is so scary.

1079
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,220
Okay.

1080
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,260
Give me a sec.

1081
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,280
I need an ally.

1082
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:17,880
Okay.

1083
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:21,240
He is giving me a sick... How does he do it?

1084
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:23,020
How does this man do it?

1085
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,740
Okay, he grabs... Oh my god!

1086
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:26,660
That's so scary!

1087
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,480
How does he do that?

1088
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,920
Okay, am I at that right spot?

1089
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,560
Is it higher?

1090
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,200
It's higher.

1091
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:34,660
Okay.

1092
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:35,820
Okay.

1093
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,760
Okay, it's like here.

1094
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,180
This is how he does it.

1095
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:39,960
This is so scary.

1096
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,880
I have to believe.

1097
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,100
What?

1098
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:44,860
What

1099
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,620
does it matter if I'm cheating?

1100
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,360
I can't even get it right!

1101
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:59,800
Okay, wait, wait, but... I can't even get that shit right!

1102
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,280
What does it matter?

1103
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:13,520
But what I did learn... What I did learn... What I did learn!

1104
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,880
How does he do it?

1105
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,100
How does he do it?

1106
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,020
Please!

1107
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,820
This would save so much time!

1108
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:22,480
Please!

1109
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,600
Please, purple guy!

1110
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:27,540
No.

1111
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,420
Okay, this would save so much time though.

1112
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,200
Just think about it.

1113
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,660
Just think about it.

1114
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:32,400
Please.

1115
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,680
This would save so much time.

1116
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,360
I know you can do this.

1117
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,400
No, you can do it!

1118
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,560
I... Fuck it, I give up.

1119
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,380
We're fucking... We're not meant to speedrun.

1120
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,960
We were never meant to speedrun, guys.

1121
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,360
We were never meant to speedrun, guys.

1122
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,800
We were not meant to speedrun.

1123
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,340
We're just a streamer.

1124
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:53,820
Okay.

1125
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:58,640
Look, I speedrun real games like Peppa Pig.

1126
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,840
Not a fucking difficult game about climbing.

1127
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,940
And you won't see this in SDGTQD.

1128
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,180
Okay.

1129
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,160
Please.

1130
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,000
No, I'm losing it.

1131
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,600
I'm losing my touch.

1132
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,120
No, no, no, you're not losing it, Doki.

1133
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,340
You gotta believe.

1134
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,040
Come on.

1135
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:24,800
Come on, this is so easy for you!

1136
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:27,840
Okay.

1137
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,240
Okay.

1138
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,140
No, this is not the right angle.

1139
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,740
This is not the right angle.

1140
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,740
Okay, one, two, three!

1141
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:36,540
There you go.

1142
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,180
I mean, the controls aren't bad!

1143
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,700
The controls aren't bad!

1144
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,460
It's a fun game!

1145
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,660
Oh no, please, please, please, please!

1146
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:51,960
Grab some sand!

1147
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,320
Okay.

1148
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:54,860
Okay.

1149
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,140
Come on, up you go.

1150
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,200
Nice.

1151
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,080
Alright.

1152
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,600
Oh god, oh god.

1153
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,160
Okay.

1154
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,040
We're good, we're good, we're good.

1155
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,440
And we have to swing from here.

1156
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,280
Okay.

1157
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,300
I got the swing for this down.

1158
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:13,040
Yeah, okay.

1159
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,820
Like, I got the leap of faith for this down.

1160
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,840
But how do you do this?

1161
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:21,940
Like...

1162
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,140
What arm is this?

1163
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:26,880
What arm is this?

1164
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,960
What arm is this?

1165
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,440
Okay, that's this arm.

1166
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:29,840
Okay.

1167
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,320
Can I climb this?

1168
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,760
Why can't I climb this?

1169
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,120
Give me...

1170
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:43,680
Give me... If I... Give me... Why can't I climb this?

1171
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,380
I don't...

1172
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:47,220
Oh god, oh god, oh god.

1173
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,400
Oh, oh, oh, please.

1174
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,720
Oh, please, climbing guy!

1175
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,660
Sir!

1176
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:55,720
Please.

1177
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,380
Please.

1178
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,960
Think of the children.

1179
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,080
Here.

1180
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:03,100
Oh no, I don't like this.

1181
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,540
I don't like this!

1182
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,340
Oh, please.

1183
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,660
Oh god, oh god.

1184
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,500
I'm so stressed out.

1185
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,720
I'm so stressed out.

1186
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:20,760
Swing!

1187
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:21,800
Okay.

1188
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:23,880
Okay.

1189
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,660
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

1190
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:30,820
oh, oh, oh, oh.

1191
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,000
No!

1192
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:32,620
No!

1193
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:36,200
Okay.

1194
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,020
Okay.

1195
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:40,680
Okay.

1196
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:41,300
Oh!

1197
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,620
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1198
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1199
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,160
Okay.

1200
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,680
I'm gonna fall.

1201
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,460
I can feel it.

1202
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,440
I can feel, I can feel the fall.

1203
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:02,210
Oh, please!

1204
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:05,410
Let me touch you!

1205
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:09,510
Oh, she falls.

1206
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:10,630
She falls.

1207
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:11,650
Please!

1208
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:13,630
Ah!

1209
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,900
I'm looking up the speedrun.

1210
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:40,020
There is a way to get there faster!

1211
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,660
I need a note!

1212
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,800
Okay, teach me purple guy.

1213
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,420
Teach me purple- what the fuck am I watching?

1214
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:53,680
Okay, okay, purple guy.

1215
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,720
Purple guy, teach me!

1216
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,020
That's fucking right!

1217
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,460
I can do this!

1218
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,660
Go purple guy, go!

1219
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,740
Okay, I figured it out.

1220
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:04,880
I figured it out.

1221
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,000
Okay, give me a sec.

1222
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,660
I still need to figure this out though.

1223
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,540
I figured it out guys.

1224
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,800
Purple guy taught me.

1225
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,440
Watch this.

1226
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,920
You guys wanna see something cool?

1227
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,180
Okay, not yet.

1228
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,180
You guys wanna see something cool?

1229
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,040
I caught you!

1230
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,900
I caught my time!

1231
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,740
So guys, I pioneered that.

1232
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:29,340
I just- I made up that trick today.

1233
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,960
Guys, isn't that cool?

1234
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,540
Guys, I made up that trick guys.

1235
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,260
Oh my god, please.

1236
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,300
It's not plagiarized!

1237
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,100
It's called the Doki Grasp!

1238
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,680
Trinkmarked by Doki.

1239
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,100
I discovered it today.

1240
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,660
Guys... damn.

1241
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,360
I trademarked it.

1242
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:57,500
Guys, call me a- who is it?

1243
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:00,620
Who is the guy who steals all- I mean, who like invents everything?

1244
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,160
Thomas Edison.

1245
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,400
Wait, no.

1246
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,400
Guys, Tesla who?

1247
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,920
Okay, here we go.

1248
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:14,500
Okay, wait.

1249
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,340
Wait, we got this.

1250
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:16,420
Alright.

1251
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,580
He was a genius!

1252
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:19,640
He was a genius!

1253
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:23,160
Thomas Edison inventing all these inventions.

1254
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,660
That's right, he's my role model right there.

1255
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,140
Guys...

1256
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,380
Who the fuck is Tesla?

1257
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,620
All I know about Tesla is that it's a car.

1258
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:39,000
That's his only contribution to society.

1259
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:44,560
He tried to fucking frame my Oshii Thomas Edison for stealing ideas?

1260
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:45,860
Fucking...

1261
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,640
He's the loser who didn't trademark.

1262
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,460
Alright, let's see.

1263
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:03,580
Alright, let's see.

1264
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,020
Guys...

1265
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,500
But I want to grow up.

1266
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,300
I want to be just like Mr. Edison.

1267
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:09,500
Inventing all those cool ideas.

1268
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,340
Just like- I'm getting there!

1269
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,100
I invented the Doki-Doki Crasp!

1270
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:25,840
Oh my god, speed-runners are gonna use- Okay, anytime you see a speedrunner that used my patented Doki Grasp, just remember I did that.

1271
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,300
I pioneered the Doki Grasp.

1272
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:31,760
Watch this.

1273
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,800
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, sorry, wait, wait, wait.

1274
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:42,200
Sorry, okay, so for those who would like to learn speedrunning, what you do is that you put your hand right here.

1275
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,280
And then you go down and then you go up.

1276
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,420
And then, sorry, this is what you shouldn't do.

1277
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:50,900
This is what you shouldn't do.

1278
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:57,220
So what you should do is like this.

1279
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,120
Oh, okay, so what you should do...

1280
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,940
is like this.

1281
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,820
Okay, guys, give me a sec.

1282
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,020
Guys, give me a sec.

1283
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:14,140
Guys, guys, don't worry, I'm trying to... I'm teaching you what the wrong ways are.

1284
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,180
Oh, God, please.

1285
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,420
Please, there you go.

1286
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:18,880
No!

1287
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:20,500
Please!

1288
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:22,300
Please!

1289
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,260
The Doki Grasp!

1290
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:25,300
Please!

1291
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,360
Patented by Doki Bird!

1292
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:30,760
Okay.

1293
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:33,580
Doki Grasp.

1294
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:35,220
Doki, just grasp it.

1295
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:36,860
Doki Grasp!

1296
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,240
Doki Grasp!

1297
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:44,180
I don't understand why is this so much harder now.

1298
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,280
I don't understand.

1299
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,480
I was doing so well.

1300
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:50,860
I was doing so well with the Doki Grasp.

1301
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:51,780
Yeah, sorry.

1302
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:54,420
There's like so many people that have been doing the grasp wrong.

1303
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,680
I'm trying to show you all the wrong ways to do it.

1304
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,100
Before I do the right way.

1305
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,400
Come on.

1306
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:02,500
Come on.

1307
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,340
No, you're strong enough for this.

1308
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:05,360
Come on.

1309
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:07,160
Come on.

1310
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:08,900
Come on!

1311
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:09,620
No!

1312
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:13,380
I see how it's safe.

1313
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,120
It does!

1314
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,120
It saves so much time!

1315
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:16,820
Look at me go!

1316
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:18,580
That's like you're right.

1317
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,440
My pure spite and anger.

1318
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:21,860
Fuck you whoever said that.

1319
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,040
I did it for you.

1320
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:27,640
Okay.

1321
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:29,480
Oh my god.

1322
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:30,460
I don't know why I did that.

1323
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:31,820
I don't know why I did that.

1324
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,200
That was way too risky.

1325
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:34,580
Okay.

1326
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:36,960
Okay.

1327
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:38,720
No!

1328
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:40,840
Please!

1329
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:43,380
Why is it so difficult?

1330
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:47,400
How did I go to grasp that?

1331
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,100
I don't understand!

1332
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,040
How does he do it?

1333
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:54,020
How?!

1334
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:56,440
How do you do that?

1335
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,900
How did you do all of this?

1336
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,040
Oh my god.

1337
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:03,700
Okay.

1338
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,320
The Doki drop.

1339
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:08,200
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1340
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,260
I don't drop.

1341
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:12,920
Every time I fall it's like strategic.

1342
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,100
Guys, I just felt like I'm going to drop.

1343
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,520
I reset my timer.

1344
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:18,700
Guys, I reset my timer every time I drop.

1345
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:21,020
Because I feel like it's just not...

1346
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:22,800
It's just not an optimal time!

1347
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:26,700
As a fellow speedrunner, you would understand, but you're not.

1348
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:29,900
You don't understand because you're not part of the group.

1349
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,340
Look at that!

1350
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:34,460
Fuck!

1351
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:34,900
Okay!

1352
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,540
Guys, I just wanted to do it again.

1353
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:39,640
I was like, that was way too easy.

1354
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:43,080
I knew people didn't see it, so I had to do it again.

1355
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:48,520
Guys, I was like, oh my god, that was way too fucking easy how I grasped that.

1356
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:52,140
So I had to do it again for everybody that missed out.

1357
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,040
Okay.

1358
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:54,340
Okay.

1359
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:57,300
Please.

1360
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:58,760
Please.

1361
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:00,280
Please.

1362
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,040
Please.

1363
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:03,880
Please.

1364
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:08,560
Okay, wait.

1365
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:10,360
There you go.

1366
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:11,920
Alright, there you go.

1367
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,040
You guys saw that?

1368
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:13,900
Alright, good.

1369
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:14,940
Because I'm not doing it again.

1370
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:20,200
I felt like I was giving you guys too many examples on how to do it.

1371
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:22,180
And you guys gotta learn eventually.

1372
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:24,280
Okay.

1373
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:24,760
Okay.

1374
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,120
That was a little risky.

1375
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:29,560
That was a little too risky for me.

1376
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:30,760
Okay.

1377
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:34,220
No!

1378
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:35,460
I didn't let go!

1379
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:36,000
It's hard!

1380
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:41,570
Why?

1381
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:43,970
Why is the Doki so...

1382
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:45,770
Guys, I just haven't perfected the Doki.

1383
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:48,470
I just haven't perfected the Doki swing.

1384
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:49,410
I just haven't perfected the Doki swing, guys.

1385
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:52,850
We will see more than just the rock.

1386
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:54,670
There's a town nearby!

1387
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:57,290
Apparently there's a town!

1388
00:46:57,890 --> 00:46:59,810
I wanna see the town!

1389
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:03,270
Let me see the town.

1390
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:04,070
Please.

1391
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:05,570
That's all I ask.

1392
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:07,770
I just wanna see the town.

1393
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:09,110
Please.

1394
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:12,710
Please let me see the town.

1395
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:14,030
Please.

1396
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:16,110
Please.

1397
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:16,470
Please.

1398
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:17,910
Let me see the town!

1399
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:18,950
Okay.

1400
00:47:19,390 --> 00:47:19,990
Alright.

1401
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:21,910
That's all I want.

1402
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:24,330
That's all Doki wants.

1403
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:26,870
She wants to know what the city looks like.

1404
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:27,730
Okay.

1405
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:30,170
We're almost there, guys!

1406
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,890
I will perfect the Doki swing!

1407
00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:36,710
Okay.

1408
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:40,770
What the fuck?!

1409
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:42,730
How did I do it?!

1410
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:46,230
How did I do it?!

1411
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:49,030
I don't understand!

1412
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:53,390
How the fuck did I do it?!

1413
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:57,090
It needs work but the Doki drop is on point.

1414
00:47:57,390 --> 00:47:59,350
Thank you for the Hakka soup.

1415
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:00,350
Thank you.

1416
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:01,010
Thank you.

1417
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:01,950
I don't understand!

1418
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:04,510
How did I do it?!

1419
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:06,370
How?!

1420
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:07,290
Okay.

1421
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:12,930
It was just so perfect that I can't perfect it?!

1422
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:13,670
Okay.

1423
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:14,010
Okay.

1424
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:15,250
We're good.

1425
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:15,490
There we go.

1426
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:16,750
Okay.

1427
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:17,530
Alright.

1428
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:18,010
We're good.

1429
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:18,430
We're good.

1430
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:19,170
We're good.

1431
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:20,090
Alright.

1432
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:23,670
We're just gonna keep climbing.

1433
00:48:24,290 --> 00:48:25,090
Keep climbing.

1434
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:26,490
Keep climbing.

1435
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:29,210
You will get the Doki swing!

1436
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:31,270
Give me a second.

1437
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:32,510
I need to look at a professional.

1438
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:34,470
Time out!

1439
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:35,210
Time out!

1440
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:36,790
It's like basketball where you get your coach in.

1441
00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:37,790
Guys, don't worry.

1442
00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:38,570
I have a coach.

1443
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:39,190
Don't...

1444
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:43,790
Don't worry.

1445
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:43,990
I have a coach.

1446
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:45,230
I have a coach.

1447
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:47,150
How the fuck does he do that?

1448
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:49,410
Is it because he has a top hat?

1449
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:56,150
Is it the top hat?

1450
00:48:56,330 --> 00:48:57,910
Is it the fucking top hat?

1451
00:48:57,970 --> 00:48:59,170
How do I get the top hat?

1452
00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:02,730
Okay, I need to make sure I don't fall.

1453
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:04,130
What arm is this?

1454
00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:05,570
Oh god, okay.

1455
00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:07,030
Okay, here we go.

1456
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:09,930
It must be the hat.

1457
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:11,130
I think it's the hat.

1458
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:14,410
I think it's the fucking hat.

1459
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:14,750
There's...

1460
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:17,370
Oh god!

1461
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:18,630
I need a timeout!

1462
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:19,770
The timeout worked, guys!

1463
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:21,310
The timeout!

1464
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:24,150
Oh god.

1465
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:43,800
Using foot.

1466
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:44,700
Guys!

1467
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:47,580
If I could use a foot, I would use a foot!

1468
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:49,500
Okay.

1469
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:53,280
Here we go.

1470
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:55,720
Oh god, it's okay.

1471
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:57,080
It's okay.

1472
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,460
It gives me more chance to perfect all my techniques.

1473
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:08,500
Guys, it's like that... it's like that... that kung fu movie where like you do like meaningless tasks... you think like they're meaningless tasks.

1474
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,440
But like all these techniques that we're learning now...

1475
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:20,360
Like the... like the... like the doki... the doki grasp... it's gonna help us in the long run, guys.

1476
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:23,060
Guys, like that shit... look at that.

1477
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:23,540
Look at that.

1478
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:24,800
I figured out the shortcut too.

1479
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:26,320
Okay.

1480
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:29,080
No!

1481
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:31,520
Yeah, yeah, karate kid!

1482
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:33,900
We're just karate kidding it right now!

1483
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:36,320
The doki grasp is gonna save lives!

1484
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:37,420
You don't understand!

1485
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,840
We're just slowly perfecting doki grasp!

1486
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:43,220
And then it'll be like baby mode.

1487
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:48,400
I'm just gonna put on...

1488
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,440
You'll see.

1489
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,220
You'll see, guys.

1490
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:52,460
The moment I let go of my training weights...

1491
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:53,860
You'll see.

1492
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,260
Okay, here we go.

1493
00:50:58,660 --> 00:50:59,140
Oh!

1494
00:50:59,140 --> 00:50:59,620
Please.

1495
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:00,680
Please.

1496
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:02,220
Okay, okay, here we go.

1497
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:05,440
Oh god, please, please, please, please.

1498
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:06,520
Please.

1499
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:08,320
Please.

1500
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:10,620
Just firmly grasp it.

1501
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:11,380
Please.

1502
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:13,000
We perfected you.

1503
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:14,220
What happened?

1504
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:14,680
Oh, nice.

1505
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:14,980
Okay.

1506
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:16,680
I told you we perfected it.

1507
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:18,720
I knew we perfected this.

1508
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:19,780
Look at that.

1509
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:22,780
Look at how fast we cut time!

1510
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:24,120
Okay.

1511
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:25,300
Okay.

1512
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:26,400
Okay.

1513
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:29,160
Oh!

1514
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:29,740
Oh!

1515
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:30,460
Oh my god!

1516
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:31,480
The doki swing.

1517
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:32,760
Here it comes.

1518
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:34,660
Oh my god!

1519
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,780
Oh my god!

1520
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:37,300
We're doing it!

1521
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:40,220
Okay.

1522
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:40,960
Okay.

1523
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:41,380
Time out.

1524
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:42,260
Basketball time out.

1525
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,720
Basketball time out!

1526
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:44,600
What did I do?

1527
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:47,540
How does he do it?

1528
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,000
How does he do it?

1529
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,400
How do you do that swing?

1530
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:51,640
Okay.

1531
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:52,260
He was like...

1532
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:52,800
Okay.

1533
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:53,500
Okay.

1534
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:54,500
Basketball time out.

1535
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:55,180
Don't worry.

1536
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:55,780
We're back in.

1537
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,500
We're back in.

1538
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:59,260
Benny, thank you for the magenta soup.

1539
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:00,180
Thank you.

1540
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:00,780
Thank you.

1541
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,140
I can finally watch stream again.

1542
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:05,320
I'm free!

1543
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,760
Welcome back, Benny!

1544
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:07,600
Oh god.

1545
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:09,020
Okay.

1546
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:09,440
Grasp.

1547
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:10,100
Okay.

1548
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:12,760
He grasped this.

1549
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:14,180
Okay.

1550
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:15,580
Coach said...

1551
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:16,040
Guys.

1552
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:17,680
Coach said...

1553
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:20,640
I need to put my hand right here.

1554
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,480
And then do...

1555
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:23,580
A swing!

1556
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:24,360
Okay.

1557
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:24,860
Wait, wait, wait.

1558
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:25,760
Wait, wait, wait.

1559
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:26,940
And then...

1560
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:27,420
No!

1561
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:28,900
No, no, no.

1562
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:29,360
Coach!

1563
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:29,920
Coach!

1564
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:30,420
Coach!

1565
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:31,500
Coach!

1566
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:36,820
Okay.

1567
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:38,900
And...

1568
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:40,400
And then...

1569
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:40,860
A swing!

1570
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:41,640
Okay.

1571
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:42,440
Coach.

1572
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:43,460
Coach, I need help.

1573
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:43,620
Coach.

1574
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:45,300
Coach, I need help!

1575
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:51,860
Please.

1576
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:53,200
Coach.

1577
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:56,080
How do you do this?

1578
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:57,260
Okay.

1579
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:58,800
And then...

1580
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,080
Oh my god.

1581
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,380
Please, please, please don't.

1582
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:01,860
No!

1583
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:08,910
My god.

1584
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:12,530
Why is that part so difficult?

1585
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:12,910
Oh my god!

1586
00:53:14,010 --> 00:53:15,870
I just want to see the town!

1587
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:18,590
Let me see the town!

1588
00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:20,670
I don't want to finish this game!

1589
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:22,270
I just want to see the city!

1590
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:23,850
That's all...

1591
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:25,970
That's all I want!

1592
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:27,490
I don't even care!

1593
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:30,610
I never want to finish this game!

1594
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:35,270
Thank you for the super chat!

1595
00:53:35,410 --> 00:53:36,070
Thank you, thank you!

1596
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:41,610
Each atom of that stone, each mineral, flake of that night-filled mountain, an item forms the world.

1597
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:44,590
The struggle itself towards the height is enough to fill a bird's heart.

1598
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:47,250
One must imagine Doki is happy!

1599
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:49,730
I'm so happy.

1600
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:51,510
I'm so happy.

1601
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:52,770
Guys!

1602
00:53:53,110 --> 00:53:54,190
There's a city!

1603
00:53:55,870 --> 00:53:57,470
I saw a city!

1604
00:53:58,130 --> 00:54:00,050
The coach saw a city!

1605
00:54:02,470 --> 00:54:03,630
It exists!

1606
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:06,310
It's like the fountain of youth!

1607
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:08,150
It exists, guys!

1608
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:10,390
I'll be the Spaniards...

1609
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:11,850
who discovered the city!

1610
00:54:12,570 --> 00:54:14,590
Thank you for the magenta soup!

1611
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:15,890
Thank you, thank you!

1612
00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:19,870
Thank you, Doki, for showing me how to master the Doki dive!

1613
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:22,970
Now I feel like a true speedrunner!

1614
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:23,530
No!

1615
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:26,030
This won't be my legacy!

1616
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:28,170
Oh my god, the Doki swing!

1617
00:54:28,450 --> 00:54:30,950
The Doki swing is getting better and better!

1618
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:35,430
I refuse to let that be my legacy!

1619
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:38,530
Oh god.

1620
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:39,610
Please.

1621
00:54:39,970 --> 00:54:40,790
Please.

1622
00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:41,910
Please.

1623
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:44,430
Come on, man!

1624
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:45,570
Come on!

1625
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:50,190
Man, come on!

1626
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:53,270
Just grasp it!

1627
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:03,000
The RC Civilization!

1628
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:05,820
Thank you for the super chat!

1629
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:07,180
Thank you, thank you!

1630
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:11,100
Oh my god, I just wanna see the city!

1631
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:12,420
Please!

1632
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:16,360
I just wanna know what the city looks like!

1633
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:19,140
They must have fiber over there!

1634
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:22,520
Oh god.

1635
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:26,200
At least, like, that part is getting easier.

1636
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:28,060
Of course it's easy!

1637
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,540
I fucking trademarked that!

1638
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:30,060
Of course!

1639
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:31,920
Doki, what are you trying to say?

1640
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:33,940
Of course it'll be easy!

1641
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,480
You literally trademarked this!

1642
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:38,340
God damn it, swing!

1643
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:40,000
Too much!

1644
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,120
Oh, shit...

1645
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,660
Nice and thank you for the super chat!

1646
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:47,520
Thank you, thank you!

1647
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:49,860
Doki, I'll be like the Batgirl banner!

1648
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:50,420
Oh!

1649
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:51,880
I'll go check it out later.

1650
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:52,700
Alright.

1651
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:53,800
Don't worry.

1652
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:54,940
But first...

1653
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:56,420
Doki must grasp.

1654
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,140
And Doki must swing.

1655
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:00,580
Don't worry.

1656
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:03,420
Oh my god, please.

1657
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:04,880
Please stop worrying.

1658
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:06,840
Guys, please stop worrying.

1659
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:07,700
Doki's got this.

1660
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:09,660
I'm gonna try to get this.

1661
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:09,980
God, please.

1662
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,460
Guys, why are you worried?

1663
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:12,940
Why are you worried, guys?

1664
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:14,680
Doki's got this!

1665
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:17,540
Doki, what happened?

1666
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:18,320
You were a master?

1667
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:19,600
There you go.

1668
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:21,880
There you go.

1669
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:22,860
Good job.

1670
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:26,700
God, why are you so fucking good at video games?

1671
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:31,980
Okay.

1672
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:35,220
No!

1673
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:35,700
Stop!

1674
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:36,500
Why are you...

1675
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,980
I can't believe it.

1676
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:42,340
Please!

1677
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:48,220
Patches, thank you for the super chat.

1678
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:49,200
Thank you, thank you.

1679
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:53,960
It's really cool that they break up this swimming game with a bit of rock climbing.

1680
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,800
Thank you for the super chat.

1681
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:56,780
Thank you, thank you.

1682
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:57,440
I swear.

1683
00:56:57,540 --> 00:57:01,960
I'm pretty sure more than 50% of the game is me climbing.

1684
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:02,860
You can't say that.

1685
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:04,800
You can't say that.

1686
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:06,120
How dare you!

1687
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:07,540
How dare you!

1688
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:13,040
This is the stream where I've discovered the speedrun technique.

1689
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,100
How dare you!

1690
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:15,880
Please.

1691
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:17,360
Oh, God, okay.

1692
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:19,140
Alright, we got this down.

1693
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:20,240
How dare you.

1694
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:22,280
This is a master at work right now.

1695
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:26,440
This is literally a master at work.

1696
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:27,880
Oh, God, please.

1697
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:29,240
Please.

1698
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:30,000
Oh, my God.

1699
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:30,720
Please.

1700
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:32,920
The Doki Sleeve!

1701
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:34,860
The Doki Sleeve!

1702
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:37,080
The Doki Sleeve!

1703
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:40,960
Oh, God, I almost fell off.

1704
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:41,640
I let go.

1705
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:43,120
I was so excited.

1706
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:44,500
I actually let go.

1707
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:46,420
I knew it.

1708
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:49,300
I knew the Doki Sleeve was right!

1709
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:52,160
Okay.

1710
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:52,840
Okay.

1711
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,300
The Doki Sleeve.

1712
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:59,860
The Doki Sleeve will always prevail.

1713
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:03,160
There were so many doubters.

1714
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:07,000
So many people that didn't believe in me.

1715
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:08,780
That's right.

1716
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:10,060
You're all Teslas.

1717
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:12,740
You'll never be like Thomas Edison!

1718
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:14,540
My Oshii!

1719
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:22,050
You'll never be as great as my Oshii.

1720
00:58:22,170 --> 00:58:23,470
You're all Teslas!

1721
00:58:26,090 --> 00:58:28,570
What a wild statement.

1722
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:32,630
There you go.

1723
00:58:34,910 --> 00:58:36,870
How dare you say Edison sucked.

1724
00:58:37,070 --> 00:58:38,710
Edison invented everything!

1725
00:58:41,450 --> 00:58:43,910
There's the money after this stream.

1726
00:58:44,830 --> 00:58:45,350
Okay.

1727
00:58:45,970 --> 00:58:47,550
Where do I go from here?

1728
00:58:47,950 --> 00:58:49,650
Where the fuck do I go?

1729
00:58:49,770 --> 00:58:51,010
I don't want to go in the water.

1730
00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:52,010
What if I die?

1731
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:53,530
I don't know if I can...

1732
00:58:54,210 --> 00:58:55,310
Is this a checkpoint?

1733
00:58:56,410 --> 00:58:56,930
Guys!

1734
00:58:57,210 --> 00:58:58,210
This is important.

1735
00:58:58,810 --> 00:59:00,310
Is this a checkpoint?

1736
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:06,490
Do I drop?

1737
00:59:08,490 --> 00:59:09,050
Yes!

1738
00:59:09,350 --> 00:59:10,690
Oh, thank God.

1739
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:12,490
Oh, thank God.

1740
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:12,810
Okay.

1741
00:59:13,530 --> 00:59:15,130
Oh, I didn't get one guide.

1742
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:17,230
I was worried that I'd get one guide.

1743
00:59:17,790 --> 00:59:19,510
I was so fucking worried.

1744
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:21,010
Alright, here you go.

1745
00:59:22,110 --> 00:59:24,530
Congratulations, you finally finished the tutorial.

1746
00:59:24,850 --> 00:59:25,970
Good luck.

1747
00:59:26,350 --> 00:59:28,010
Thank you for the chat.

1748
00:59:28,330 --> 00:59:28,830
Thank you.

1749
00:59:28,870 --> 00:59:29,390
Thank you.

1750
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:31,030
Oh, God.

1751
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:32,270
I'm scared here actually.

1752
00:59:33,910 --> 00:59:34,530
Oh, God.

1753
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:34,810
Okay.

1754
00:59:35,290 --> 00:59:36,310
Grasp the bush.

1755
00:59:37,810 --> 00:59:39,090
Grasp the bush!

1756
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:42,370
Okay, here you go.

1757
00:59:42,890 --> 00:59:43,730
I made it.

1758
00:59:43,890 --> 00:59:44,330
Guys.

1759
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:46,890
I made it to the first checkpoint!

1760
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:48,590
Wait.

1761
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:49,470
Do I grasp this?

1762
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:50,370
Yeah, I think so.

1763
00:59:51,010 --> 00:59:51,450
Okay.

1764
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:53,230
Alright.

1765
00:59:53,230 --> 00:59:53,930
This is good.

1766
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:55,230
This is good.

1767
00:59:55,570 --> 00:59:56,170
One minute.

1768
00:59:57,170 --> 00:59:57,610
Please.

1769
00:59:58,030 --> 00:59:58,470
Okay.

1770
00:59:59,390 --> 01:00:00,050
We're not gonna...

1771
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:01,570
We're not gonna go down.

1772
01:00:02,530 --> 01:00:03,070
Ugh!

1773
01:00:03,910 --> 01:00:04,450
Come on!

1774
01:00:05,530 --> 01:00:07,130
What would Edison do?

1775
01:00:08,550 --> 01:00:09,810
Always tell yourself!

1776
01:00:10,450 --> 01:00:12,610
What would Thomas Edison do?

1777
01:00:13,590 --> 01:00:16,130
Your words of motivation is right here!

1778
01:00:18,190 --> 01:00:18,730
No!

1779
01:00:19,230 --> 01:00:21,070
Oh, oh, oh.

1780
01:00:21,370 --> 01:00:21,930
Oh, God.

1781
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:22,470
Oh, God.

1782
01:00:22,470 --> 01:00:22,870
Oh, God.

1783
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:23,290
Oh, God.

1784
01:00:23,290 --> 01:00:23,670
Oh, God.

1785
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:24,470
Where's my other hand?

1786
01:00:24,910 --> 01:00:25,990
Where's my other hand?

1787
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:27,270
Where is it?

1788
01:00:28,430 --> 01:00:29,370
It's not there.

1789
01:00:29,370 --> 01:00:31,150
Edison would not fall.

1790
01:00:31,530 --> 01:00:33,270
Edison would not fall.

1791
01:00:34,930 --> 01:00:36,470
Edison would never...

1792
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:39,610
Edison would never give up and will keep on stealing ideas!

1793
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:41,610
I mean, um...

1794
01:00:41,610 --> 01:00:43,470
He is a great inventor, guys.

1795
01:00:45,310 --> 01:00:48,450
While I'm climbing in swimming game.

1796
01:00:48,830 --> 01:00:50,650
Thank you for the super chat, beast.

1797
01:00:50,890 --> 01:00:51,230
Thank you.

1798
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:51,930
Thank you.

1799
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:53,950
Channel Edison.

1800
01:00:56,070 --> 01:00:56,670
Here.

1801
01:00:57,030 --> 01:00:58,890
This is it.

1802
01:00:59,870 --> 01:01:00,870
Alright, here we go.

1803
01:01:00,970 --> 01:01:02,010
You would never fall!

1804
01:01:05,170 --> 01:01:05,650
Alright.

1805
01:01:08,350 --> 01:01:09,430
Alright, here we go.

1806
01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:11,670
Okay.

1807
01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:12,590
Okay, here we go.

1808
01:01:12,910 --> 01:01:14,490
Gotta get a bit closer.

1809
01:01:15,290 --> 01:01:17,210
Gotta get a bit closer to that bush.

1810
01:01:17,870 --> 01:01:19,150
Before we can...

1811
01:01:19,150 --> 01:01:19,550
Whoa!

1812
01:01:20,090 --> 01:01:22,210
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1813
01:01:22,410 --> 01:01:22,890
Here we go.

1814
01:01:23,470 --> 01:01:23,950
Alright.

1815
01:01:24,070 --> 01:01:24,790
This is it.

1816
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:27,150
Alright.

1817
01:01:27,270 --> 01:01:28,750
We gotta...

1818
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:30,370
We gotta...

1819
01:01:30,370 --> 01:01:31,810
Grasp the bush!

1820
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:34,590
Okay, the bush has been grasped.

1821
01:01:34,970 --> 01:01:35,650
Alright.

1822
01:01:36,550 --> 01:01:37,970
I am so scared.

1823
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:40,510
I am so scared.

1824
01:01:42,330 --> 01:01:43,530
Oh, God.

1825
01:01:43,690 --> 01:01:45,430
I don't like this level.

1826
01:01:45,650 --> 01:01:47,790
I don't like this level at all.

1827
01:01:48,570 --> 01:01:49,770
There's too much water.

1828
01:01:50,570 --> 01:01:51,570
I hate water.

1829
01:01:53,350 --> 01:01:56,130
Why must we need water to survive?

1830
01:01:57,990 --> 01:02:00,170
What has water... You know what?

1831
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:03,090
I wish the human body never needed water.

1832
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:04,770
Okay, here we go.

1833
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:06,470
Okay, and then...

1834
01:02:06,470 --> 01:02:07,450
Come on.

1835
01:02:08,110 --> 01:02:09,050
Come on.

1836
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:10,710
There's a rock right here!

1837
01:02:12,030 --> 01:02:12,930
Okay, nice.

1838
01:02:13,950 --> 01:02:15,970
What has water done for me?

1839
01:02:17,090 --> 01:02:17,690
Nothing!

1840
01:02:18,510 --> 01:02:19,470
Okay, this way.

1841
01:02:20,650 --> 01:02:22,790
Why must we need water?

1842
01:02:22,930 --> 01:02:23,870
It's stupid!

1843
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:29,630
Oh, God.

1844
01:02:29,710 --> 01:02:30,090
Oh, God.

1845
01:02:30,090 --> 01:02:33,650
That is like such a fucking scary bush right there.

1846
01:02:34,270 --> 01:02:34,870
Okay.

1847
01:02:35,590 --> 01:02:36,410
This way.

1848
01:02:37,350 --> 01:02:38,550
Down we go.

1849
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:43,140
Is that...

1850
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:44,480
Is that bush I can grab?

1851
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:45,320
I can't tell!

1852
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:49,400
I can't tell what I can grab and what I can't grab!

1853
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:52,280
No, that's just rock.

1854
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:53,240
Okay.

1855
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,240
Wait, what?

1856
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:56,280
What do I grab?

1857
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:57,240
Down here?

1858
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:01,060
Okay.

1859
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:02,140
Come on.

1860
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,360
Your arm can extend higher!

1861
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:06,860
Don't fuck with me!

1862
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:08,260
Don't fuck with me!

1863
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:09,240
Don't fuck with me!

1864
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:11,520
Okay.

1865
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:15,480
I know your hand can extend higher than this!

1866
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:16,340
I know your hand can extend higher than this!

1867
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:16,420
Okay.

1868
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:18,980
That's a scary rock there.

1869
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:21,180
I can't!

1870
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:21,880
I'm trying!

1871
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:24,720
I'm trying to grab!

1872
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:27,660
Okay.

1873
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:29,300
Alright.

1874
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:32,680
AHHHHHHH!

1875
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:43,160
Whoa.

1876
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:44,220
Whoa.

1877
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:46,120
That was close.

1878
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,440
That was a little too close.

1879
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:49,660
I didn't like that.

1880
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:51,440
I didn't like that.

1881
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,300
Guys, I might have to call a timeout.

1882
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:55,340
My coach might want me to call a timeout, guys.

1883
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:56,080
I...

1884
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:01,460
Okay, here we go.

1885
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:02,640
Alright.

1886
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:04,040
Up.

1887
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:05,240
Up, Baco.

1888
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:06,340
No!

1889
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:06,900
No!

1890
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:07,360
No!

1891
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:08,340
Sanctuary!

1892
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:09,500
Sanctuary!

1893
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,980
Sorry, thank you for the super chat.

1894
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:16,140
Thank you, thank you.

1895
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:19,700
Guys, I might have to call a basketball timeout, guys.

1896
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:20,620
Okay, bye.

1897
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:23,980
No coach, only climb.

1898
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:29,980
Do you think Michael Phelps didn't do it all by himself?

1899
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:34,360
Michael Phelps I don't know if you guys know.

1900
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:37,920
Other than his fucking proportionally abnormal fucking body.

1901
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:43,340
Because his fucking arms are longer than like the fucking rest of his body.

1902
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,300
He needed a coach too, guys.

1903
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:47,920
It's not just genetics.

1904
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:52,360
It's not just genetics.

1905
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:54,460
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1906
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:54,720
Okay.

1907
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:57,260
Okay, here we go.

1908
01:04:58,080 --> 01:04:58,600
Okay.

1909
01:04:58,600 --> 01:04:58,720
Okay.

1910
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:01,600
Alright, this is it.

1911
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:03,080
This is it.

1912
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:05,600
Okay, we grassed the bush.

1913
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:08,380
We grassed the branch right here.

1914
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:09,940
Here we go.

1915
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:11,020
Oh!

1916
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:13,000
Oh!

1917
01:05:13,180 --> 01:05:13,780
Okay.

1918
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:15,540
Alright.

1919
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:18,020
Okay.

1920
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:20,240
Guys, it's not just genetics.

1921
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:24,280
We have to remember the coaches we have all along!

1922
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:28,440
You think Thomas Edison did this all by himself?

1923
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:29,220
He did.

1924
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:31,360
He's a fucking genius and that's why he's my Oshie.

1925
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:33,440
Don't believe the lies Tesla says.

1926
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:41,520
The only man that never needed a coach was Thomas Edison.

1927
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:43,240
All him.

1928
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:44,800
Okay.

1929
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:45,420
There we go.

1930
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:47,080
Alright.

1931
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:50,740
That's why he's my Oshie.

1932
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:52,120
Okay.

1933
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:55,840
This is an anti-Tesla sound.

1934
01:05:57,460 --> 01:05:58,580
This is an anti-Tesla sound.

1935
01:05:58,580 --> 01:05:59,920
I'm a Tesla anti.

1936
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:01,220
That's looking right.

1937
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:04,760
I will die a Tesla anti.

1938
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:10,140
He didn't steal Jack's shit!

1939
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,920
That's what the haters said!

1940
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:14,120
You don't have proof!

1941
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:16,580
It's been hundreds of years!

1942
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:17,440
Move on!

1943
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:22,740
Okay.

1944
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:25,000
Here we go.

1945
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:27,160
Oh my god, please.

1946
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:27,960
Let me.

1947
01:06:28,580 --> 01:06:29,740
Let me go around.

1948
01:06:30,510 --> 01:06:30,960
No.

1949
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:35,430
Okay.

1950
01:06:35,630 --> 01:06:36,290
Thanks!

1951
01:06:36,290 --> 01:06:37,330
Okay, grass.

1952
01:06:37,510 --> 01:06:37,750
Okay.

1953
01:06:38,150 --> 01:06:38,990
No!

1954
01:06:39,190 --> 01:06:39,430
Okay.

1955
01:06:39,510 --> 01:06:39,990
Oh, thank god.

1956
01:06:40,010 --> 01:06:40,250
Okay.

1957
01:06:41,570 --> 01:06:43,110
Tesla's landing.

1958
01:06:43,730 --> 01:06:46,070
I love pressing it.

1959
01:06:46,230 --> 01:06:48,190
Thomas Edison edition.

1960
01:06:49,150 --> 01:06:50,050
Edison edition.

1961
01:06:50,150 --> 01:06:51,050
Guys.

1962
01:06:51,530 --> 01:06:52,810
Move on!

1963
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:56,410
Edison won!

1964
01:06:56,490 --> 01:06:58,910
Move on, Tesla fans!

1965
01:07:02,910 --> 01:07:03,590
Okay.

1966
01:07:03,670 --> 01:07:04,770
This is it.

1967
01:07:04,850 --> 01:07:05,330
Ugh.

1968
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:07,910
I don't know what to do.

1969
01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:10,870
I don't remember how I did this.

1970
01:07:10,970 --> 01:07:12,330
What is this game?

1971
01:07:13,270 --> 01:07:17,330
It is a game that reunites...

1972
01:07:17,330 --> 01:07:21,790
It's helped to inflame my love for my Oshie.

1973
01:07:24,590 --> 01:07:26,690
Tesla shitless enchantment.

1974
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:27,410
Tesla shitless enchantment.

1975
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:27,750
Tesla shitless enchantment.

1976
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:28,890
Tesla shitless enchantment.

1977
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:31,910
Oh shit, I hate this.

1978
01:07:31,970 --> 01:07:33,050
I hate that.

1979
01:07:33,410 --> 01:07:34,430
Alright, here we go.

1980
01:07:35,170 --> 01:07:35,690
Alright,

1981
01:07:38,710 --> 01:07:39,210
here we go.

1982
01:07:42,670 --> 01:07:44,250
Okay, let's see what's down.

1983
01:07:44,430 --> 01:07:45,950
I don't know how to do this.

1984
01:07:46,330 --> 01:07:46,850
Guys!

1985
01:07:47,330 --> 01:07:49,010
Guys, I'm calling in my coach!

1986
01:07:49,370 --> 01:07:50,170
Thomas Edison!

1987
01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:50,410
Thomas Edison!

1988
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:55,490
Guys, I'm calling in my coach!

1989
01:07:55,710 --> 01:07:56,770
How does he do it?

1990
01:07:56,850 --> 01:07:57,030
Coach!

1991
01:07:57,470 --> 01:07:58,510
Coach, I'm struggling!

1992
01:07:58,570 --> 01:07:59,870
How do you do that, coach?

1993
01:08:06,310 --> 01:08:09,190
It's okay, the coach will save me.

1994
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:10,190
Coach!

1995
01:08:10,770 --> 01:08:12,230
Okay, he did that.

1996
01:08:12,470 --> 01:08:13,730
Okay, coach is there.

1997
01:08:14,450 --> 01:08:14,930
Coach!

1998
01:08:14,950 --> 01:08:15,710
Coach Edison!

1999
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:18,990
Thank you, coach Edison, with your power!

2000
01:08:20,170 --> 01:08:21,690
I shall be able to climb now.

2001
01:08:26,950 --> 01:08:29,050
No, oh, oh, oh, coach!

2002
01:08:29,510 --> 01:08:30,030
Coach!

2003
01:08:30,330 --> 01:08:31,170
Thank you, coach!

2004
01:08:32,390 --> 01:08:33,430
AHHHHH COACH!

2005
01:08:35,670 --> 01:08:36,850
Coach, I'm falling!

2006
01:08:37,130 --> 01:08:38,270
Is this supposed to happen?

2007
01:08:42,010 --> 01:08:44,050
Okay, all right, I figured out though.

2008
01:08:44,390 --> 01:08:46,190
I figured out how to get through that.

2009
01:08:46,930 --> 01:08:49,810
Coach said that was supposed to happen because I didn't do it.

2010
01:08:50,170 --> 01:08:50,470
I didn't do it good enough.

2011
01:08:51,750 --> 01:09:01,130
He said that coach Edison told me that because I didn't do the technique properly enough that I have to restart from down there.

2012
01:09:01,490 --> 01:09:02,670
Thank you!

2013
01:09:03,250 --> 01:09:04,350
Don't worry, coach.

2014
01:09:04,610 --> 01:09:06,210
I'll perfect this technique!

2015
01:09:07,870 --> 01:09:09,450
Yes, thank you for the super chat.

2016
01:09:09,530 --> 01:09:10,230
Thank you, thank you!

2017
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:12,710
Pulling up the Ouija board every time.

2018
01:09:12,850 --> 01:09:15,930
Every time I have to contact their Oshii.

2019
01:09:16,030 --> 01:09:17,490
You don't understand!

2020
01:09:18,190 --> 01:09:18,810
Hehehehe.

2021
01:09:20,170 --> 01:09:20,390
Okay.

2022
01:09:21,610 --> 01:09:22,170
All right.

2023
01:09:23,210 --> 01:09:23,830
All right.

2024
01:09:24,970 --> 01:09:25,750
Here we go.

2025
01:09:25,890 --> 01:09:26,770
I need to climb up the rock.

2026
01:09:27,690 --> 01:09:28,170
HWAAA!

2027
01:09:28,270 --> 01:09:29,090
Oh, God.

2028
01:09:29,550 --> 01:09:30,250
Here we go.

2029
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:31,330
Ah.

2030
01:09:31,630 --> 01:09:32,110
Eh!

2031
01:09:32,350 --> 01:09:32,830
COACH!

2032
01:09:32,970 --> 01:09:33,910
I SWEAR, COACH!

2033
01:09:34,010 --> 01:09:35,110
LET ME HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE!

2034
01:09:35,810 --> 01:09:37,370
I GOT THIS, COACH!

2035
01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:38,870
Hehehehe.

2036
01:09:39,110 --> 01:09:39,590
Hehehehe.

2037
01:09:42,110 --> 01:09:42,590
COACH!

2038
01:09:43,830 --> 01:09:44,310
Hehehehe.

2039
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:46,870
Hehehehe.

2040
01:09:46,870 --> 01:09:47,230
Hehehehe.

2041
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:49,530
Please don't make me restart!

2042
01:09:50,990 --> 01:09:51,350
Okay.

2043
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:53,090
Okay.

2044
01:09:54,090 --> 01:09:54,610
All right.

2045
01:09:54,710 --> 01:09:57,090
We gotta get up from here.

2046
01:09:58,070 --> 01:09:58,430
HWAAA!

2047
01:09:58,610 --> 01:09:59,130
There we go!

2048
01:09:59,490 --> 01:10:00,210
I figured it.

2049
01:10:00,310 --> 01:10:00,470
No!

2050
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:01,630
No, no, no, no, no, no!

2051
01:10:02,030 --> 01:10:02,870
No, no, no, no, no, no!

2052
01:10:02,890 --> 01:10:03,470
It's fine.

2053
01:10:03,570 --> 01:10:03,930
We're fine.

2054
01:10:04,030 --> 01:10:04,310
We're fine.

2055
01:10:04,970 --> 01:10:06,770
Okay, we need two hands on this rock.

2056
01:10:07,270 --> 01:10:08,110
And then...

2057
01:10:08,790 --> 01:10:09,670
Okay, here we go.

2058
01:10:10,470 --> 01:10:11,030
Here we go.

2059
01:10:11,870 --> 01:10:12,290
Here we go.

2060
01:10:12,690 --> 01:10:14,030
And then...

2061
01:10:14,970 --> 01:10:15,330
Reset.

2062
01:10:15,330 --> 01:10:15,550
No!

2063
01:10:15,830 --> 01:10:16,130
Woo!

2064
01:10:17,150 --> 01:10:17,590
Okay.

2065
01:10:17,590 --> 01:10:18,150
It's fine.

2066
01:10:18,210 --> 01:10:18,870
We can drop here.

2067
01:10:19,390 --> 01:10:20,370
It's our sanctuary.

2068
01:10:20,970 --> 01:10:22,410
We can drop here.

2069
01:10:23,110 --> 01:10:23,650
Here we go.

2070
01:10:23,770 --> 01:10:24,030
Try it.

2071
01:10:24,070 --> 01:10:24,850
Thank you for the super chat.

2072
01:10:24,930 --> 01:10:25,170
Thank you.

2073
01:10:25,230 --> 01:10:25,650
Thank you.

2074
01:10:25,750 --> 01:10:26,970
I just got here.

2075
01:10:27,110 --> 01:10:30,010
Thank you for joining at the beginning for me.

2076
01:10:30,290 --> 01:10:31,550
This isn't the beginning!

2077
01:10:32,310 --> 01:10:33,610
This is the sanctuary!

2078
01:10:35,710 --> 01:10:37,370
Thank you for the super chat.

2079
01:10:37,470 --> 01:10:37,810
Thank you.

2080
01:10:37,830 --> 01:10:38,390
Thank you.

2081
01:10:38,970 --> 01:10:39,590
All right.

2082
01:10:40,290 --> 01:10:40,850
Here we go.

2083
01:10:41,790 --> 01:10:42,390
All right.

2084
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:43,950
This is fine.

2085
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:46,330
This is fine.

2086
01:10:47,090 --> 01:10:47,610
Okay.

2087
01:10:48,170 --> 01:10:48,790
We're good.

2088
01:10:48,890 --> 01:10:49,130
We're good.

2089
01:10:50,510 --> 01:10:51,030
Oh!

2090
01:10:52,010 --> 01:10:53,250
We made it though.

2091
01:10:53,850 --> 01:10:55,090
We made it here.

2092
01:10:55,670 --> 01:10:56,610
This is fine.

2093
01:10:58,010 --> 01:10:59,050
This is fine.

2094
01:11:00,810 --> 01:11:01,850
Come on!

2095
01:11:02,890 --> 01:11:04,450
Just grasp it!

2096
01:11:05,650 --> 01:11:07,470
The Doki Grasp!

2097
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:10,230
The Doki Grasp!

2098
01:11:10,750 --> 01:11:11,270
Okay.

2099
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:12,970
Maybe the Doki Grasp back here.

2100
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:14,290
Oh.

2101
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:16,590
Let's see.

2102
01:11:18,330 --> 01:11:18,970
Okay.

2103
01:11:19,210 --> 01:11:19,970
All right.

2104
01:11:20,350 --> 01:11:21,070
Come on.

2105
01:11:21,630 --> 01:11:22,450
Come on.

2106
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:23,590
No!

2107
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:24,110
No!

2108
01:11:24,130 --> 01:11:24,750
Come on!

2109
01:11:24,770 --> 01:11:25,350
Please!

2110
01:11:26,830 --> 01:11:27,470
Please!

2111
01:11:27,630 --> 01:11:30,310
I just want to see the city!

2112
01:11:30,790 --> 01:11:33,770
I want to know what the city looks like!

2113
01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:37,410
I've only heard stories from Maoshi!

2114
01:11:39,070 --> 01:11:39,710
Please!

2115
01:11:41,270 --> 01:11:44,530
I remember when I first saw Maoshi.

2116
01:11:44,530 --> 01:11:46,750
Mr. Thomas Edison.

2117
01:11:48,130 --> 01:11:50,030
He promised me a tale.

2118
01:11:50,270 --> 01:11:52,450
He promised me a golden city.

2119
01:11:53,070 --> 01:11:54,930
If I reach the top!

2120
01:11:58,650 --> 01:11:59,250
Please!

2121
01:12:00,930 --> 01:12:01,530
Okay.

2122
01:12:03,190 --> 01:12:03,930
It's okay.

2123
01:12:05,890 --> 01:12:06,750
It's okay.

2124
01:12:10,030 --> 01:12:10,790
It's okay.

2125
01:12:10,890 --> 01:12:11,290
We're fine.

2126
01:12:12,070 --> 01:12:13,630
Thank you for the super chat.

2127
01:12:13,630 --> 01:12:14,050
Thank you.

2128
01:12:14,250 --> 01:12:14,650
Thank you.

2129
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:16,190
Please.

2130
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:16,630
Just...

2131
01:12:17,070 --> 01:12:17,510
Please.

2132
01:12:18,050 --> 01:12:19,770
Please let me grab it!

2133
01:12:19,830 --> 01:12:21,270
Why can't I grab water?

2134
01:12:22,350 --> 01:12:23,610
Why are you a liquid?

2135
01:12:24,490 --> 01:12:25,890
Are you stupid?

2136
01:12:30,910 --> 01:12:31,350
Okay.

2137
01:12:32,130 --> 01:12:32,790
All right.

2138
01:12:32,930 --> 01:12:33,570
I'm good.

2139
01:12:33,630 --> 01:12:33,970
I'm good.

2140
01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:34,450
I'm good.

2141
01:12:34,470 --> 01:12:35,610
I just need to grab this rock.

2142
01:12:36,850 --> 01:12:37,290
Please.

2143
01:12:37,330 --> 01:12:37,870
Just let me...

2144
01:12:37,870 --> 01:12:39,230
I can't even grab rocks anymore.

2145
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:40,790
I can't even...

2146
01:12:40,790 --> 01:12:40,930
Okay.

2147
01:12:40,970 --> 01:12:41,290
Here we go.

2148
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:50,490
Just like that.

2149
01:13:03,090 --> 01:13:03,990
Let me grab rocks.

2150
01:13:04,270 --> 01:13:05,090
Okay.

2151
01:13:05,410 --> 01:13:06,070
All right.

2152
01:13:07,110 --> 01:13:07,490
Here we go.

2153
01:13:07,510 --> 01:13:11,170
Oh my god.

2154
01:13:11,170 --> 01:13:11,270
Let's grab things.

2155
01:13:11,270 --> 01:13:13,230
Tesla paid for all that!

2156
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:20,910
You're getting shilled by the Tesla Corps!

2157
01:13:22,750 --> 01:13:25,610
Nice try Tesla propagandist!

2158
01:13:25,630 --> 01:13:27,230
You can't fool me!

2159
01:13:27,710 --> 01:13:31,930
Edison already told me to be careful with people like you!

2160
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:38,740
Okay, here we go.

2161
01:13:38,980 --> 01:13:39,900
Here we go.

2162
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:44,860
I can not grab that rocket!

2163
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:46,420
Don't be a sheep!

2164
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:48,540
Open your eyes!

2165
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:51,240
Oh thank god!

2166
01:13:51,340 --> 01:13:52,720
It just hit my head on the rock!

2167
01:13:52,780 --> 01:13:53,180
It's okay.

2168
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:53,800
I'm still here!

2169
01:13:55,420 --> 01:14:02,660
Get off Twitter and read a book!

2170
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:03,720
Tesla shill!

2171
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:13,000
Read the history book!

2172
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:15,240
No one talks about Tesla there!

2173
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:21,160
They say history books are written by winners!

2174
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:22,860
That means it's true!

2175
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:26,300
That means Thomas Edison won!

2176
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:28,280
So it's true!

2177
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:30,860
Here we go.

2178
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:33,380
Edison losing to Edward.

2179
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:38,640
That's so true!

2180
01:14:39,820 --> 01:14:40,440
That's right!

2181
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:42,420
That means Tesla's a loser!

2182
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:45,380
If he's not in that history books!

2183
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,100
Alright, let's go.

2184
01:14:48,180 --> 01:14:51,680
I didn't expect myself to start my day ranting about this.

2185
01:14:54,220 --> 01:14:55,640
Edison invents itself!

2186
01:14:55,780 --> 01:14:56,340
Exactly!

2187
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,120
There it is!

2188
01:14:58,120 --> 01:14:59,220
Thank you for the super chat!

2189
01:14:59,360 --> 01:14:59,860
Thank you!

2190
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:00,540
Thank you!

2191
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:02,260
Okay.

2192
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:03,360
Alright.

2193
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:04,820
Here we go.

2194
01:15:09,930 --> 01:15:10,970
That's...here we go.

2195
01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:12,090
Make a bullet!

2196
01:15:12,210 --> 01:15:14,110
Edison versus Tesla!

2197
01:15:14,430 --> 01:15:15,810
I don't need a make a bullet!

2198
01:15:15,830 --> 01:15:16,230
Pick a paw!

2199
01:15:16,610 --> 01:15:18,670
I know who's a real winner!

2200
01:15:20,350 --> 01:15:20,930
Okay.

2201
01:15:24,330 --> 01:15:25,330
Here we go.

2202
01:15:26,910 --> 01:15:27,910
Oh my god.

2203
01:15:28,290 --> 01:15:30,070
You know now that I think about it...

2204
01:15:30,070 --> 01:15:32,210
Eventually somebody's gonna draw like...

2205
01:15:32,210 --> 01:15:32,750
Thishimen.

2206
01:15:33,030 --> 01:15:34,110
Is that how you pronounce it?

2207
01:15:35,750 --> 01:15:36,850
Um...Tesla and Edison.

2208
01:15:37,190 --> 01:15:41,850
Unless somebody's gonna draw like a manga about like...

2209
01:15:43,190 --> 01:15:44,330
Um...Tesla and Edison.

2210
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:45,810
Or something like... reading comics.

2211
01:15:45,830 --> 01:15:49,710
It's like, we just reincarnated Tesla and Edison in like modern world.

2212
01:15:49,950 --> 01:15:51,670
And then people are gonna ship this too.

2213
01:15:51,870 --> 01:15:55,190
I swear if it hasn't been done already, I know it's going to happen.

2214
01:15:57,970 --> 01:16:02,510
Manga has... Manga anime has no bounds.

2215
01:16:02,810 --> 01:16:04,650
It will always happen eventually.

2216
01:16:04,950 --> 01:16:06,890
It already exists.

2217
01:16:07,470 --> 01:16:08,710
I know.

2218
01:16:08,710 --> 01:16:12,390
Yeah, it came then Tesla and Edison.

2219
01:16:12,710 --> 01:16:14,130
I can feel it.

2220
01:16:14,190 --> 01:16:16,970
Edison is the jock and then...

2221
01:16:20,430 --> 01:16:23,010
And Tesla is the art kid.

2222
01:16:24,670 --> 01:16:25,990
Worlds collide.

2223
01:16:33,490 --> 01:16:35,170
Here you go.

2224
01:16:36,390 --> 01:16:38,670
If it hasn't happened yet, it's...

2225
01:16:38,710 --> 01:16:39,970
You guys know it.

2226
01:16:39,990 --> 01:16:40,610
Don't stop it.

2227
01:16:40,750 --> 01:16:43,070
You can't stop it.

2228
01:16:44,450 --> 01:16:45,090
Okay.

2229
01:16:45,090 --> 01:16:45,990
Here you go.

2230
01:16:50,510 --> 01:16:53,090
Please, let me grasp the rock.

2231
01:16:53,910 --> 01:16:54,810
Here you go.

2232
01:16:56,450 --> 01:16:56,990
Oh god.

2233
01:16:57,550 --> 01:16:58,350
Oh god.

2234
01:16:58,670 --> 01:17:00,030
And then... Okay, here you go.

2235
01:17:00,110 --> 01:17:04,050
And then like Edison and Tesla got assigned on a science project together.

2236
01:17:04,430 --> 01:17:10,250
And then Tesla's like...

2237
01:17:10,270 --> 01:17:12,270
Thought that like Edison and him were getting closer.

2238
01:17:12,610 --> 01:17:17,570
But then like he felt betrayed because Thomas Edison took all the credit for his work.

2239
01:17:17,770 --> 01:17:20,870
And he never talked to him again after the science project.

2240
01:17:21,150 --> 01:17:22,590
And then, he was heartbroken.

2241
01:17:24,910 --> 01:17:25,510
Stop.

2242
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:32,450
Oh my god, the sanctuary.

2243
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:35,130
Stop letting her cook.

2244
01:17:36,310 --> 01:17:37,390
Alright, here you go.

2245
01:17:39,150 --> 01:17:39,930
Alright, here we go.

2246
01:17:39,930 --> 01:17:45,270
I can't believe Duggazot cancelled over 200 year old corporate espionage.

2247
01:17:45,610 --> 01:17:47,310
Thank you for the super chat.

2248
01:17:47,430 --> 01:17:48,890
Thank you, thank you, general.

2249
01:17:49,290 --> 01:17:50,910
Never cook again.

2250
01:17:51,270 --> 01:17:52,110
It exists.

2251
01:17:52,370 --> 01:17:53,490
I don't even need a cook.

2252
01:17:53,610 --> 01:17:55,210
I'm pretty sure it exists somewhere.

2253
01:17:55,570 --> 01:17:56,890
I'm pretty sure.

2254
01:17:58,590 --> 01:18:00,130
You can't stop it.

2255
01:18:01,690 --> 01:18:04,450
Alright, here we go.

2256
01:18:05,690 --> 01:18:06,810
There you go.

2257
01:18:06,810 --> 01:18:06,810
Nice.

2258
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:08,530
We got the bush.

2259
01:18:09,110 --> 01:18:10,170
It's the rock.

2260
01:18:10,330 --> 01:18:12,150
I can never do the rock anymore!

2261
01:18:15,550 --> 01:18:18,650
I can never do the rock!

2262
01:18:19,810 --> 01:18:19,970
Okay.

2263
01:18:21,410 --> 01:18:22,050
Please!

2264
01:18:24,070 --> 01:18:25,410
Please for Edison!

2265
01:18:28,170 --> 01:18:28,490
Please.

2266
01:18:29,590 --> 01:18:31,290
Please, I just...

2267
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:33,430
My coach is watching me.

2268
01:18:34,450 --> 01:18:35,170
He's filming this!

2269
01:18:35,370 --> 01:18:35,710
Please!

2270
01:18:37,850 --> 01:18:38,370
Please!

2271
01:18:38,670 --> 01:18:41,050
I don't want to be kicked out of the Edison Club!

2272
01:18:41,570 --> 01:18:42,810
I worked so hard!

2273
01:18:43,470 --> 01:18:44,190
There you go.

2274
01:18:44,330 --> 01:18:45,250
Oh, thank god.

2275
01:18:45,370 --> 01:18:45,610
No!

2276
01:18:47,830 --> 01:18:48,350
No!

2277
01:18:49,750 --> 01:18:50,270
No!

2278
01:18:51,910 --> 01:18:54,010
Alright, thank you for the super chat.

2279
01:18:54,090 --> 01:18:54,950
Thank you, thank you.

2280
01:18:55,070 --> 01:18:56,550
Edison, you telegram.

2281
01:18:56,770 --> 01:18:57,370
Who's this?

2282
01:18:58,070 --> 01:18:59,650
Tesla fiercely typing.

2283
01:18:59,690 --> 01:19:01,310
Thank you for the super chat.

2284
01:19:01,410 --> 01:19:02,350
Thank you, thank you.

2285
01:19:04,530 --> 01:19:06,270
Thank you for the super chat.

2286
01:19:06,350 --> 01:19:07,370
Thank you, thank you.

2287
01:19:07,450 --> 01:19:08,210
Wait, wait, wait.

2288
01:19:08,350 --> 01:19:11,090
Oh, sanctuary!

2289
01:19:11,650 --> 01:19:12,290
Sanctuary!

2290
01:19:13,470 --> 01:19:21,210
Because of the Hamilton musical, I've ironically seen people ship the historical figures of those guys they're based off.

2291
01:19:21,370 --> 01:19:24,490
So Tesla X Edison is definitely a thing that probably exists.

2292
01:19:24,650 --> 01:19:25,250
Exactly!

2293
01:19:26,830 --> 01:19:27,470
Exactly!

2294
01:19:27,470 --> 01:19:27,990
Exactly!

2295
01:19:31,290 --> 01:19:33,030
Anything is shippable!

2296
01:19:34,830 --> 01:19:36,570
You can avoid it!

2297
01:19:36,590 --> 01:19:38,670
Kitchen appliances can be shippable!

2298
01:19:38,870 --> 01:19:40,070
Are you thinking hard enough?

2299
01:19:40,410 --> 01:19:42,190
But please don't think hard enough, guys.

2300
01:19:42,270 --> 01:19:42,870
We don't need...

2301
01:19:45,770 --> 01:19:46,390
Alright.

2302
01:19:47,310 --> 01:19:48,290
Okay, here we go.

2303
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:49,570
Alright.

2304
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:53,030
Doki, please stop cooking.

2305
01:19:53,110 --> 01:19:56,210
I'm not ready for Nicole Edison to ship this out.

2306
01:19:57,470 --> 01:19:59,070
Super chat, thank you, thank you.

2307
01:19:59,170 --> 01:20:00,210
It's too late.

2308
01:20:00,490 --> 01:20:01,510
It's too late.

2309
01:20:01,590 --> 01:20:03,130
I'm pretty sure it already exists.

2310
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:04,830
I'm pretty sure.

2311
01:20:05,090 --> 01:20:07,130
We just need to make them anime boys.

2312
01:20:09,710 --> 01:20:11,470
To complete the trifecta.

2313
01:20:12,230 --> 01:20:14,850
We need to make them anime boys.

2314
01:20:14,970 --> 01:20:15,710
Or girls.

2315
01:20:15,950 --> 01:20:17,710
You know, cause that also works too.

2316
01:20:21,230 --> 01:20:23,550
If we can do it with countries!

2317
01:20:23,970 --> 01:20:25,970
We can do it with Tesla!

2318
01:20:26,470 --> 01:20:27,450
We can do it with Tesla!

2319
01:20:27,470 --> 01:20:27,850
And Edison!

2320
01:20:31,390 --> 01:20:33,270
Not just once!

2321
01:20:33,490 --> 01:20:35,230
But three times!

2322
01:20:36,150 --> 01:20:38,930
Do you think it only happened in Italia?

2323
01:20:39,450 --> 01:20:40,030
No!

2324
01:20:40,410 --> 01:20:44,990
We've had personification of countries three fucking times!

2325
01:20:46,150 --> 01:20:48,630
And they are always getting shipped!

2326
01:20:52,630 --> 01:20:54,250
Stop cooking.

2327
01:20:54,670 --> 01:20:55,630
Stop cooking.

2328
01:20:56,390 --> 01:20:57,880
Three fucking times!

2329
01:20:58,470 --> 01:20:59,790
When will we stop?

2330
01:21:00,470 --> 01:21:01,190
Okay.

2331
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:01,730
Anyway.

2332
01:21:02,110 --> 01:21:03,030
Here we go.

2333
01:21:04,030 --> 01:21:06,530
And one time they were just balls!

2334
01:21:07,110 --> 01:21:09,390
But yet people still shipped them!

2335
01:21:09,790 --> 01:21:11,890
They were just balls!

2336
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:15,160
They were just balls!

2337
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:17,380
When will we learn?

2338
01:21:17,420 --> 01:21:19,220
We will never learn.

2339
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:24,820
We will never learn.

2340
01:21:24,940 --> 01:21:27,320
You're so right though.

2341
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:30,860
What the hell is she yapping about?

2342
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:31,240
No!

2343
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:33,080
No!

2344
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:37,160
I got kicked out of my seat!

2345
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:37,670
No!

2346
01:21:45,570 --> 01:21:46,390
No!

2347
01:21:46,730 --> 01:21:47,490
No!

2348
01:21:47,490 --> 01:21:48,070
No!

2349
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:48,390
No!

2350
01:21:49,330 --> 01:21:50,850
I talk too much!

2351
01:21:51,250 --> 01:21:52,070
No!

2352
01:21:56,310 --> 01:21:57,130
Tesla!

2353
01:21:57,370 --> 01:21:58,750
This is your fault!

2354
01:22:00,070 --> 01:22:01,670
America's only shit!

2355
01:22:01,690 --> 01:22:02,770
Your ship is to oil!

2356
01:22:02,930 --> 01:22:05,610
Thank you for the super chat!

2357
01:22:05,670 --> 01:22:06,530
Thank you!

2358
01:22:06,570 --> 01:22:10,050
I got kicked out for talking too much!

2359
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:12,790
For talking too much about shipping!

2360
01:22:13,570 --> 01:22:15,710
For talking too much about shipping!

2361
01:22:15,710 --> 01:22:15,970
No!

2362
01:22:16,970 --> 01:22:17,710
No!

2363
01:22:17,710 --> 01:22:18,410
The sanctuary!

2364
01:22:19,890 --> 01:22:20,630
No!

2365
01:22:24,070 --> 01:22:26,710
I don't even remember I did this!

2366
01:22:27,090 --> 01:22:27,110
I don't even remember I did this!

2367
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:27,810
Okay.

2368
01:22:28,390 --> 01:22:29,130
Okay.

2369
01:22:29,150 --> 01:22:29,570
Here we go.

2370
01:22:29,790 --> 01:22:31,390
The dokey grass!

2371
01:22:31,690 --> 01:22:31,930
No!

2372
01:22:31,930 --> 01:22:32,870
The dokey grass!

2373
01:22:35,510 --> 01:22:36,130
Oh my god.

2374
01:22:36,370 --> 01:22:38,430
It's not muscle memory anymore.

2375
01:22:38,950 --> 01:22:41,650
It's been too long since I've grasped here.

2376
01:22:42,030 --> 01:22:42,710
Okay.

2377
01:22:44,070 --> 01:22:44,750
Okay.

2378
01:22:45,230 --> 01:22:46,690
We just gotta...

2379
01:22:46,690 --> 01:22:48,330
We just gotta do this.

2380
01:22:48,350 --> 01:22:49,350
The dokey swing.

2381
01:22:49,990 --> 01:22:50,670
Okay.

2382
01:22:52,110 --> 01:22:52,790
Please!

2383
01:22:52,850 --> 01:22:53,530
No!

2384
01:22:55,750 --> 01:22:56,270
No!

2385
01:22:56,270 --> 01:22:56,290
No!

2386
01:22:58,870 --> 01:22:59,390
Ninja!

2387
01:22:59,530 --> 01:23:00,670
Don't say that!

2388
01:23:01,130 --> 01:23:02,470
Thank you for the super chat!

2389
01:23:02,550 --> 01:23:02,850
Thank you!

2390
01:23:04,550 --> 01:23:06,550
I'm sorry to tell you this dokey.

2391
01:23:06,670 --> 01:23:08,370
The game knows Tesla was right.

2392
01:23:08,630 --> 01:23:10,210
And will never let you see...

2393
01:23:10,210 --> 01:23:10,670
Please!

2394
01:23:12,190 --> 01:23:14,590
You will never change a Tesla empty!

2395
01:23:19,530 --> 01:23:21,970
You will never change my mind!

2396
01:23:22,030 --> 01:23:22,590
You will never change my mind!

2397
01:23:23,750 --> 01:23:24,830
Edison forever!

2398
01:23:26,270 --> 01:23:26,870
Okay.

2399
01:23:27,290 --> 01:23:27,890
No!

2400
01:23:28,090 --> 01:23:28,510
Fuck!

2401
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:28,930
Okay.

2402
01:23:30,290 --> 01:23:31,070
It's fine.

2403
01:23:31,210 --> 01:23:32,570
That doesn't count as a fall.

2404
01:23:32,730 --> 01:23:35,630
I grasped the mountain in time.

2405
01:23:36,490 --> 01:23:37,090
Okay.

2406
01:23:37,150 --> 01:23:37,650
Here we go.

2407
01:23:38,410 --> 01:23:39,010
Alright.

2408
01:23:39,570 --> 01:23:40,890
We're gonna go up.

2409
01:23:41,810 --> 01:23:44,210
Woshi Edison for life!

2410
01:23:44,490 --> 01:23:45,590
Edison for life!

2411
01:23:45,930 --> 01:23:46,530
Mahoshi!

2412
01:23:46,910 --> 01:23:48,390
He can do no wrong!

2413
01:23:48,390 --> 01:23:49,450
Okay.

2414
01:23:52,190 --> 01:23:52,510
Alright.

2415
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:53,050
Here we go.

2416
01:23:53,930 --> 01:23:54,570
Grasp!

2417
01:23:55,090 --> 01:23:55,730
Okay.

2418
01:23:56,830 --> 01:23:57,470
Grasp.

2419
01:23:57,690 --> 01:24:00,290
I don't remember how to do the swing.

2420
01:24:00,950 --> 01:24:03,010
The dokey swing eludes me.

2421
01:24:04,130 --> 01:24:04,710
I spin.

2422
01:24:05,730 --> 01:24:07,670
My muscle memory is gone.

2423
01:24:08,990 --> 01:24:09,630
Okay.

2424
01:24:11,970 --> 01:24:13,150
Please don't!

2425
01:24:17,070 --> 01:24:17,710
Darkblade!

2426
01:24:17,770 --> 01:24:18,370
Thank you for the super chat!

2427
01:24:18,390 --> 01:24:19,270
Thank you!

2428
01:24:19,410 --> 01:24:19,850
Thank you!

2429
01:24:19,890 --> 01:24:27,930
As a child, Edison saved me from a burning building which was caused by Tesla's blatant and fork copy of Edison's work.

2430
01:24:28,190 --> 01:24:30,870
I am only alive due to Edison.

2431
01:24:31,150 --> 01:24:32,790
Thank you, Oshi Edison!

2432
01:24:33,090 --> 01:24:34,170
I am 100%...

2433
01:24:34,170 --> 01:24:34,370
See!

2434
01:24:34,750 --> 01:24:35,770
Look at that!

2435
01:24:36,170 --> 01:24:39,130
We have testimonies from fellow Edison fans!

2436
01:24:39,790 --> 01:24:40,890
Look at that!

2437
01:24:43,230 --> 01:24:43,930
Alright.

2438
01:24:44,150 --> 01:24:48,370
We as part of the Edison fandom We're called the Edison fans.

2439
01:24:48,390 --> 01:24:48,590
We're the...

2440
01:24:51,930 --> 01:24:52,570
We're...

2441
01:24:52,570 --> 01:24:53,450
We're...

2442
01:24:54,130 --> 01:24:55,470
What's our fan name, guys?

2443
01:24:55,710 --> 01:24:58,890
What is the Thomas Edison fan name, guys?

2444
01:24:59,010 --> 01:24:59,930
What are we?

2445
01:25:01,430 --> 01:25:02,710
The Edison's...

2446
01:25:02,710 --> 01:25:04,470
The Eddieheads...

2447
01:25:04,470 --> 01:25:07,310
As a fellow Eddiehead!

2448
01:25:07,630 --> 01:25:08,230
Uh...

01:25:13,370 --> 01:25:16,690

2451
01:25:16,810 --> 01:25:17,130

Guys, as a fellow Eddie's...

2457

We will not let you tarnish our Oshi's name like this!

2458
01:25:29,170 --> 01:25:29,750
Fucking...

2459
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:32,570
Stupid Tesla... The Tesla sons?

2460
01:25:32,950 --> 01:25:33,450
I don't know.

2461
01:25:33,630 --> 01:25:34,210
I don't know.

2462
01:25:34,310 --> 01:25:38,770
I don't care enough about the Tesla fandom to know what your fan name is!

2463
01:25:44,170 --> 01:25:45,230
Oh, please!

2464
01:25:45,310 --> 01:25:47,590
I can't swim anymore!

2465
01:25:57,510 --> 01:25:59,990
I saw Edison start the fire and take care of it.

2466
01:26:00,170 --> 01:26:00,390
No!

2467
01:26:00,550 --> 01:26:01,330
You did not!

2468
01:26:02,010 --> 01:26:02,930
That's a Tesla!

2469
01:26:03,310 --> 01:26:04,330
That's a Tesla!

2470
01:26:08,350 --> 01:26:09,790
Yeah, that's my Oshi...

2471
01:26:09,790 --> 01:26:12,490
I like that the light bulb is my Oshi sign.

2472
01:26:14,590 --> 01:26:16,030
Yeah, that's what the fucking...

2473
01:26:16,030 --> 01:26:17,950
The fucking testicles say.

2474
01:26:18,070 --> 01:26:18,890
Yeah, that's right.

2475
01:26:18,950 --> 01:26:20,110
I call you testicles!

2476
01:26:20,510 --> 01:26:21,290
That's right!

2477
01:26:21,370 --> 01:26:22,890
What are you gonna do about it, huh?

2478
01:26:23,730 --> 01:26:26,710
You don't have cool names like us, the Eddie's.

2479
01:26:27,390 --> 01:26:28,530
That's fucking right.

2480
01:26:28,830 --> 01:26:30,870
Try to steal our Oshi mark too?

2481
01:26:31,070 --> 01:26:34,030
We all know Edison invented the light bulb.

2482
01:26:35,010 --> 01:26:36,990
Get your own Oshi mark.

2483
01:26:41,850 --> 01:26:42,890
Alright, here you go.

2484
01:26:45,150 --> 01:26:46,390
Alright, no please!

2485
01:26:47,610 --> 01:26:49,850
I just wanna get to the sanctuary.

2486
01:26:51,410 --> 01:26:52,310
Oh, there you go.

2487
01:26:52,370 --> 01:26:52,830
We got it.

2488
01:26:53,370 --> 01:26:55,030
Oh god, oh god, oh god.

2489
01:26:55,090 --> 01:26:56,350
What is going on with you?

2490
01:26:56,470 --> 01:26:58,110
Why are you freaking out on me?

2491
01:26:58,990 --> 01:27:00,070
Bro, Eddie's forever.

2492
01:27:00,730 --> 01:27:01,390
Eddie's forever!

2493
01:27:02,950 --> 01:27:04,090
My true fandom.

2494
01:27:05,690 --> 01:27:06,130
Okay.

2495
01:27:06,890 --> 01:27:07,650
Here you go.

2496
01:27:08,110 --> 01:27:10,170
I need to remember how to fucking do the swing.

2497
01:27:10,170 --> 01:27:12,550
The swing is so hard, guys.

2498
01:27:12,750 --> 01:27:14,650
It's so difficult, guys.

2499
01:27:16,690 --> 01:27:17,250
Oh!

2500
01:27:17,250 --> 01:27:17,810
Oh!

2501
01:27:17,810 --> 01:27:18,730
Oh, I did it!

2502
01:27:20,890 --> 01:27:21,450
No!

2503
01:27:21,450 --> 01:27:22,010
What?!

2504
01:27:26,180 --> 01:27:27,240
Yeah, Tesla.

2505
01:27:27,380 --> 01:27:28,640
More like Tess lame.

2506
01:27:29,020 --> 01:27:29,240
Oh!

2507
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:33,480
Thank you for the super chat, man.

2508
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:34,540
Thank you, thank you.

2509
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:36,480
Jesus, please.

2510
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:37,780
I just wanna go back.

2511
01:27:37,940 --> 01:27:39,460
Let me go back to the sanctuary.

2512
01:27:40,140 --> 01:27:40,700
Please.

2513
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:42,700
Let me go back.

2514
01:27:44,580 --> 01:27:45,900
This game.

2515
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:47,100
Please.

2516
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:48,700
Please.

2517
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:50,700
I have enough of FOMO.

2518
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:53,140
Please.

2519
01:27:53,140 --> 01:27:54,360
I got the FOMO.

2520
01:27:55,180 --> 01:27:55,840
Ugh.

2521
01:27:57,060 --> 01:27:58,720
I already have enough.

2522
01:27:58,960 --> 01:27:59,920
I don't wanna miss.

2523
01:28:00,060 --> 01:28:01,240
I'm done missing out.

2524
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:05,280
I'm okay with missing out now.

2525
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:06,680
Okay, nice.

2526
01:28:06,740 --> 01:28:07,460
Okay, here you go.

2527
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:09,120
Alright.

2528
01:28:10,580 --> 01:28:11,240
Okay.

2529
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:12,400
Grab.

2530
01:28:13,060 --> 01:28:13,580
Grab.

2531
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:15,160
Grab.

2532
01:28:15,480 --> 01:28:18,760
They don't know about my light pop Eddie's try.

2533
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:21,040
Thank you for the super chat, guys.

2534
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:21,760
Thank you.

2535
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:22,520
Thank you.

2536
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:25,840
No!

2537
01:28:25,940 --> 01:28:31,950
Why did you f- Neapolitan, thank you for the super chat.

2538
01:28:32,050 --> 01:28:32,470
Thank you.

2539
01:28:32,490 --> 01:28:33,090
Thank you.

2540
01:28:34,010 --> 01:28:36,810
We Eddies will not bow down to the Tessies.

2541
01:28:37,270 --> 01:28:37,790
Exactly.

2542
01:28:38,230 --> 01:28:38,850
That's right.

2543
01:28:38,990 --> 01:28:41,190
We don't even know what your fan names are.

2544
01:28:41,190 --> 01:28:44,230
We just call you Tessicles to make fun of you.

2545
01:28:50,810 --> 01:28:51,870
Alright, here you go.

2546
01:28:52,450 --> 01:28:53,030
Let's go.

2547
01:28:53,550 --> 01:28:54,070
No!

2548
01:28:54,070 --> 01:28:54,690
Come on!

2549
01:28:55,270 --> 01:28:57,390
Just let me back in.

2550
01:28:57,990 --> 01:29:00,450
I just wanna go back to the sanctuary.

2551
01:29:03,850 --> 01:29:04,810
Alright, here you go.

2552
01:29:05,530 --> 01:29:06,050
Ugh.

2553
01:29:06,110 --> 01:29:06,750
No, no.

2554
01:29:06,770 --> 01:29:07,230
Come on.

2555
01:29:07,390 --> 01:29:07,950
Come on!

2556
01:29:09,630 --> 01:29:10,150
Grasp!

2557
01:29:11,630 --> 01:29:12,150
Grasp!

2558
01:29:13,730 --> 01:29:14,250
Grasp!

2559
01:29:14,510 --> 01:29:16,150
Okay, maybe I go a bit higher.

2560
01:29:16,590 --> 01:29:17,530
Okay, here you go.

2561
01:29:18,550 --> 01:29:19,070
Nice.

2562
01:29:19,310 --> 01:29:19,630
No!

2563
01:29:19,830 --> 01:29:20,430
Not nice!

2564
01:29:22,270 --> 01:29:23,050
Not nice.

2565
01:29:24,050 --> 01:29:24,810
Not nice.

2566
01:29:25,630 --> 01:29:26,310
Not nice.

2567
01:29:26,910 --> 01:29:30,350
Like I said, I can't be as innocent as that.

2568
01:29:30,690 --> 01:29:32,750
Thank you for the super chat, Ninja.

2569
01:29:32,790 --> 01:29:33,370
Thank you.

2570
01:29:33,390 --> 01:29:33,990
Thank you.

2571
01:29:34,010 --> 01:29:35,610
You're just brainwashed.

2572
01:29:35,810 --> 01:29:37,070
Don't be a sheep.

2573
01:29:40,210 --> 01:29:41,090
Alright, here you go.

2574
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:42,750
Okay.

2575
01:29:42,750 --> 01:29:43,190
Breezy.

2576
01:29:43,230 --> 01:29:44,570
Have you tried not falling?

2577
01:29:44,770 --> 01:29:45,590
I hear it's helpful.

2578
01:29:45,950 --> 01:29:46,930
Thank you for the super chat.

2579
01:29:47,030 --> 01:29:47,390
Thank you.

2580
01:29:47,390 --> 01:29:47,850
Thank you.

2581
01:29:47,890 --> 01:29:48,370
Oh, shit!

2582
01:29:48,410 --> 01:29:48,790
You're right.

2583
01:29:48,930 --> 01:29:49,570
Sorry, guys.

2584
01:29:50,310 --> 01:29:51,110
Sorry, I forgot.

2585
01:29:51,170 --> 01:29:52,110
I had my fall.

2586
01:29:52,250 --> 01:29:53,850
I had my fall button on.

2587
01:29:54,030 --> 01:29:55,450
I just turned it off, guys.

2588
01:29:56,030 --> 01:29:56,930
So you watch this.

2589
01:29:57,850 --> 01:29:58,290
Woo!

2590
01:29:58,290 --> 01:29:58,730
Fuck!

2591
01:29:58,950 --> 01:29:59,310
No!

2592
01:30:00,210 --> 01:30:02,230
Why do you fall like this?

2593
01:30:03,150 --> 01:30:03,590
Why?

2594
01:30:04,950 --> 01:30:07,250
Why do you fall like that?

2595
01:30:08,410 --> 01:30:08,850
Bro!

2596
01:30:10,270 --> 01:30:12,810
I just wanted to go to the city.

2597
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:14,650
I just wanted to go to the city.

2598
01:30:15,710 --> 01:30:16,670
Okay, here you go.

2599
01:30:17,550 --> 01:30:18,250
Here you go.

2600
01:30:18,550 --> 01:30:19,290
It's okay.

2601
01:30:20,150 --> 01:30:20,890
It's okay.

2602
01:30:21,070 --> 01:30:23,870
I fall on purpose to perfect my technique, guys.

2603
01:30:24,270 --> 01:30:30,990
Like, I have to perfect my technique here in the beginning instead of like further down the line.

2604
01:30:31,050 --> 01:30:31,590
You know, guys?

2605
01:30:31,790 --> 01:30:36,610
Like, if I perfect it here, then I won't like fuck it up next time.

2606
01:30:36,710 --> 01:30:37,010
You know?

2607
01:30:37,310 --> 01:30:39,650
You gotta perfect it in the beginning.

2608
01:30:40,370 --> 01:30:42,370
So like, you can use it later on.

2609
01:30:42,930 --> 01:30:44,070
At the later stages.

2610
01:30:45,210 --> 01:30:45,910
There you go.

2611
01:30:45,970 --> 01:30:46,170
See?

2612
01:30:46,310 --> 01:30:46,690
Look at that.

2613
01:30:46,750 --> 01:30:47,530
Like the Doki grasp.

2614
01:30:47,850 --> 01:30:55,210
I perfected it here in the beginning, and because of that, like, I don't have to worry about fucking it up at the later stages.

2615
01:30:56,830 --> 01:30:57,310
Okay.

2616
01:31:00,210 --> 01:31:01,330
Oh my god.

2617
01:31:01,690 --> 01:31:02,170
Please.

2618
01:31:04,650 --> 01:31:05,130
Please.

2619
01:31:07,050 --> 01:31:07,530
Please.

2620
01:31:12,140 --> 01:31:12,940
Please.

2621
01:31:12,940 --> 01:31:15,520
Just let me experience.

2622
01:31:15,580 --> 01:31:16,220
Please.

2623
01:31:16,300 --> 01:31:17,020
Why?

2624
01:31:17,060 --> 01:31:20,660
Why did I hit my head in the sanctuary?

2625
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:23,280
Why?

2626
01:31:25,700 --> 01:31:26,500
Why?

2627
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:35,580
Why won't a shark just put me under my misery and just eat me?

2628
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:37,600
Please.

2629
01:31:39,700 --> 01:31:40,500
Okay.

2630
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:41,500
We're fine.

2631
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:42,920
We're fine.

2632
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:44,220
It's fine.

2633
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:46,000
Everything's fine.

2634
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:47,440
Boop.

2635
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:48,460
Up we go.

2636
01:31:48,820 --> 01:31:50,020
Up we go.

2637
01:31:50,300 --> 01:31:52,020
Imperial, thank you for the super chat.

2638
01:31:52,100 --> 01:31:52,580
Thank you.

2639
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:53,240
Thank you.

2640
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:55,160
Grasp.

2641
01:31:55,480 --> 01:31:56,040
No.

2642
01:31:56,160 --> 01:31:57,620
It has to be like perfectly here.

2643
01:31:57,980 --> 01:31:58,540
Grasp!

2644
01:31:59,020 --> 01:31:59,580
Okay.

2645
01:31:59,740 --> 01:32:00,880
Got that down.

2646
01:32:01,680 --> 01:32:03,400
I got the grasp down.

2647
01:32:04,300 --> 01:32:04,860
Okay.

2648
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:08,120
Okay.

2649
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:08,220
Okay.

2650
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:12,740
Yes!

2651
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:15,080
Which arm is this?

2652
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:16,420
Okay, it's this arm.

2653
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:17,500
Okay.

2654
01:32:20,700 --> 01:32:21,220
Okay.

2655
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:22,460
Oh!

2656
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:25,480
I hate this.

2657
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:27,580
Oh!

2658
01:32:27,580 --> 01:32:28,660
Please.

2659
01:32:31,610 --> 01:32:32,750
Oh!

2660
01:32:32,850 --> 01:32:33,930
Please.

2661
01:32:34,850 --> 01:32:35,990
Oh!

2662
01:32:36,700 --> 01:32:37,270
Please.

2663
01:32:37,270 --> 01:32:37,470
Please.

2664
01:32:37,870 --> 01:32:38,870
Please.

2665
01:32:41,130 --> 01:32:43,390
Oh, please.

2666
01:32:47,570 --> 01:32:48,570
Please.

2667
01:32:49,370 --> 01:32:49,710
Please!

2668
01:32:51,250 --> 01:32:51,270
Ah!

2669
01:32:53,230 --> 01:32:56,210
I hate this so much.

2670
01:32:56,510 --> 01:32:58,530
I hate this so much.

2671
01:32:58,550 --> 01:32:59,770
Oh, God.

2672
01:33:00,350 --> 01:33:01,630
Oh, God.

2673
01:33:04,590 --> 01:33:05,590
Oh!

2674
01:33:06,670 --> 01:33:09,640
The alien's grasp!

2675
01:33:09,940 --> 01:33:10,380
Okay.

2676
01:33:10,580 --> 01:33:11,240
Okay.

2677
01:33:11,700 --> 01:33:12,400
Okay.

2678
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:13,500
Alright.

2679
01:33:14,700 --> 01:33:15,400
Alright.

2680
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:16,540
We made it.

2681
01:33:17,740 --> 01:33:18,840
We made it.

2682
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:21,240
Oh, I hate that sound though.

2683
01:33:22,060 --> 01:33:24,460
I hate that sound so much.

2684
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:27,240
I hate that sound so much.

2685
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:27,560
Okay.

2686
01:33:27,740 --> 01:33:28,020
Okay.

2687
01:33:31,750 --> 01:33:32,450
WWED.

2688
01:33:32,710 --> 01:33:33,770
What will Edison do?

2689
01:33:34,110 --> 01:33:35,950
Always practice WWED.

2690
01:33:36,390 --> 01:33:37,990
Always practice WWED.

2691
01:33:37,990 --> 01:33:38,310
Ah!

2692
01:33:38,630 --> 01:33:39,270
No!

2693
01:33:39,850 --> 01:33:39,850
Ah!

2694
01:33:40,650 --> 01:33:41,130
No!

2695
01:33:53,930 --> 01:33:56,110
I can't believe it.

2696
01:33:56,290 --> 01:33:57,030
I can't believe it.

2697
01:33:57,950 --> 01:33:59,410
We were there.

2698
01:33:59,830 --> 01:34:01,250
We were there.

2699
01:34:02,170 --> 01:34:04,670
We were right there, chat.

2700
01:34:05,910 --> 01:34:08,430
It was actually right there.

2701
01:34:10,070 --> 01:34:10,530
No!

2702
01:34:10,850 --> 01:34:13,750
Why must you test me like this?

2703
01:34:14,030 --> 01:34:18,710
I've been in Advent any since you've debuted.

2704
01:34:19,170 --> 01:34:19,630
any since you've debuted.

2705
01:34:20,770 --> 01:34:21,410
No!

2706
01:34:24,530 --> 01:34:25,170
Okay.

2707
01:34:25,410 --> 01:34:25,730
Nice.

2708
01:34:26,050 --> 01:34:27,050
We got it.

2709
01:34:28,970 --> 01:34:30,370
This is Tesla's fault.

2710
01:34:30,470 --> 01:34:31,110
I can feel it.

2711
01:34:31,970 --> 01:34:32,870
I can feel it.

2712
01:34:35,510 --> 01:34:37,210
Spreading his fucking propaganda.

2713
01:34:37,710 --> 01:34:39,430
You'll never convert me!

2714
01:34:40,390 --> 01:34:43,370
I'll never be a goddamn testicle!

2715
01:34:46,870 --> 01:34:47,510
Okay.

2716
01:34:47,990 --> 01:34:48,630
Okay.

2717
01:34:48,690 --> 01:34:48,870
Okay.

2718
01:34:50,250 --> 01:34:50,770
Alright.

2719
01:34:50,870 --> 01:34:51,350
Here we go.

2720
01:34:52,630 --> 01:34:53,510
Okay.

2721
01:34:54,110 --> 01:34:54,990
Okay.

2722
01:34:55,370 --> 01:34:56,250
Okay.

2723
01:34:58,010 --> 01:34:58,450
Alright.

2724
01:34:58,450 --> 01:34:59,330
Crap.

2725
01:34:59,490 --> 01:34:59,950
Here.

2726
01:35:02,590 --> 01:35:03,330
Ugh!

2727
01:35:04,230 --> 01:35:05,070
UGH!

2728
01:35:06,270 --> 01:35:07,150
AHH!

2729
01:35:08,030 --> 01:35:10,030
No, no, no, no, no!

2730
01:35:12,170 --> 01:35:12,770
Here we go.

2731
01:35:13,210 --> 01:35:13,770
No!

2732
01:35:14,110 --> 01:35:14,990
No!

2733
01:35:15,930 --> 01:35:16,810
No!

2734
01:35:17,350 --> 01:35:18,230
No!

2735
01:35:20,250 --> 01:35:21,110
I don't understand!

2736
01:35:26,710 --> 01:35:28,370
I don't understand!

2737
01:35:30,370 --> 01:35:32,590
Everything else is so easy!

2738
01:35:34,610 --> 01:35:35,070
Yes.

2739
01:35:35,550 --> 01:35:37,170
Take me to the... I don't care.

2740
01:35:37,390 --> 01:35:38,410
I'm gonna settle.

2741
01:35:39,590 --> 01:35:40,650
I'm gonna settle.

2742
01:35:40,890 --> 01:35:42,630
I just wanna go to the sanctuary.

2743
01:35:43,250 --> 01:35:44,230
I'm settling.

2744
01:35:44,730 --> 01:35:45,770
I'm settling.

2745
01:35:47,980 --> 01:35:49,270
I don't care anymore.

2746
01:35:49,410 --> 01:35:51,150
Just take me to the sanctuary.

2747
01:35:51,590 --> 01:35:52,750
I don't care.

2748
01:35:54,490 --> 01:35:55,090
WHAAAA!

2749
01:35:59,310 --> 01:35:59,910
Please.

2750
01:36:00,270 --> 01:36:02,010
I'm gonna settle!

2751
01:36:06,650 --> 01:36:08,750
Gwen, thank you for the super chat.

2752
01:36:08,850 --> 01:36:09,230
Thank you.

2753
01:36:09,290 --> 01:36:09,830
Thank you.

2754
01:36:10,410 --> 01:36:15,330
When you wanna climb up but a game detects an Edison, support testicles.

2755
01:36:15,870 --> 01:36:18,230
Thank you for the super chat.

2756
01:36:18,310 --> 01:36:19,250
Thank you.

2757
01:36:21,390 --> 01:36:21,990
No!

2758
01:36:21,990 --> 01:36:23,730
We're not gonna settle!

2759
01:36:24,150 --> 01:36:25,190
I can't!

2760
01:36:25,190 --> 01:36:27,590
I don't think we're making it to the city!

2761
01:36:29,170 --> 01:36:29,890
Okay.

2762
01:36:30,990 --> 01:36:31,710
Up!

2763
01:36:31,890 --> 01:36:32,790
There we go.

2764
01:36:33,370 --> 01:36:34,090
Alright.

2765
01:36:34,410 --> 01:36:38,170
At least I trademarked the Doki Grasp there.

2766
01:36:38,430 --> 01:36:39,910
Doki Grasp technique.

2767
01:36:40,250 --> 01:36:41,170
You're welcome.

2768
01:36:42,570 --> 01:36:42,930
Okay.

2769
01:36:47,830 --> 01:36:48,550
No!

2770
01:36:48,850 --> 01:36:49,570
Fuck!

2771
01:36:49,910 --> 01:36:51,330
God damn it!

2772
01:36:51,330 --> 01:36:52,050
This momentum!

2773
01:36:52,170 --> 01:36:53,310
I hate it!

2774
01:36:53,310 --> 01:36:56,390
I'm pretty sure I'm not even doing it correctly.

2775
01:36:56,570 --> 01:36:58,190
I'm pretty sure.

2776
01:36:58,590 --> 01:37:02,710
I'm pretty sure that's not even the correct way to fucking do the swing.

2777
01:37:03,110 --> 01:37:04,850
God damn it!

2778
01:37:07,290 --> 01:37:07,970
Please.

2779
01:37:09,110 --> 01:37:11,170
That's like the hardest part.

2780
01:37:12,590 --> 01:37:14,690
The 360 swing.

2781
01:37:14,990 --> 01:37:18,250
Why is Edison not doing a 360 swing?

2782
01:37:19,070 --> 01:37:20,710
How does he do it?

2783
01:37:21,490 --> 01:37:22,170
Okay.

2784
01:37:23,310 --> 01:37:23,430
Okay.

2785
01:37:24,090 --> 01:37:26,950
We need to realign ourselves here.

2786
01:37:29,170 --> 01:37:32,810
We need to realign ourselves to be at this edge.

2787
01:37:33,090 --> 01:37:34,150
And then...

2788
01:37:35,330 --> 01:37:35,970
Please.

2789
01:37:36,650 --> 01:37:37,290
Please.

2790
01:37:38,130 --> 01:37:39,610
Please just grasp this.

2791
01:37:41,090 --> 01:37:41,730
Please.

2792
01:37:41,970 --> 01:37:42,730
Oh god.

2793
01:37:42,790 --> 01:37:42,970
Okay.

2794
01:37:43,210 --> 01:37:44,450
We grasp that.

2795
01:37:44,610 --> 01:37:45,330
And then...

2796
01:37:46,190 --> 01:37:47,710
And then we go from here.

2797
01:37:50,230 --> 01:37:51,510
This part.

2798
01:37:51,670 --> 01:37:53,730
I hate this part so much.

2799
01:37:54,870 --> 01:37:55,670
Okay.

2800
01:37:59,770 --> 01:38:02,010
God damn it!

2801
01:38:05,830 --> 01:38:09,210
Let me go past this area!

2802
01:38:09,610 --> 01:38:11,270
We were so close!

2803
01:38:11,510 --> 01:38:11,970
See?

2804
01:38:12,190 --> 01:38:13,470
That's the worst part!

2805
01:38:13,910 --> 01:38:15,590
We were like right there!

2806
01:38:16,910 --> 01:38:18,410
We were literally right there!

2807
01:38:20,430 --> 01:38:21,810
Oh my god.

2808
01:38:23,310 --> 01:38:23,890
We were right there!

2809
01:38:24,110 --> 01:38:25,450
It was so close!

2810
01:38:28,090 --> 01:38:29,650
We were right there!

2811
01:38:29,830 --> 01:38:31,690
I literally saw the sanctuary!

2812
01:38:33,030 --> 01:38:34,090
The sanctuary!

2813
01:38:35,250 --> 01:38:37,130
We were right there!

2814
01:38:37,510 --> 01:38:39,530
Why did I have to hit my head?

2815
01:38:40,890 --> 01:38:41,490
Why did I have to hit my head?

2816
01:38:43,670 --> 01:38:44,270
Okay.

2817
01:38:44,270 --> 01:38:44,330
Alright.

2818
01:38:44,390 --> 01:38:44,630
There you go.

2819
01:38:45,630 --> 01:38:46,230
Alright.

2820
01:38:47,030 --> 01:38:47,910
This is it.

2821
01:38:48,990 --> 01:38:50,350
There you go.

2822
01:38:53,230 --> 01:38:54,390
I'm gonna try this swing.

2823
01:38:55,330 --> 01:38:56,330
I'm gonna try this.

2824
01:38:57,650 --> 01:38:58,130
Yes!

2825
01:38:58,670 --> 01:38:58,970
Oh!

2826
01:38:59,130 --> 01:38:59,610
I did it!

2827
01:39:01,290 --> 01:39:03,290
Perfected a new technique that's less...

2828
01:39:03,950 --> 01:39:05,210
That's less fucked up!

2829
01:39:05,610 --> 01:39:06,090
Guys!

2830
01:39:06,110 --> 01:39:07,670
I perfected a new technique guys!

2831
01:39:11,150 --> 01:39:11,630
No.

2832
01:39:12,010 --> 01:39:12,490
No!

2833
01:39:13,610 --> 01:39:14,090
No!

2834
01:39:14,250 --> 01:39:14,390
No!

2835
01:39:15,590 --> 01:39:16,070
I...

2836
01:39:18,050 --> 01:39:18,500
Please!

2837
01:39:18,950 --> 01:39:19,130
Please!

2838
01:39:19,610 --> 01:39:21,470
Just get me out of here!

2839
01:39:22,130 --> 01:39:24,990
I don't wanna be here anymore!

2840
01:39:26,630 --> 01:39:29,750
I just wanna be at the sanctuary!

2841
01:39:31,090 --> 01:39:31,990
Please!

2842
01:39:34,470 --> 01:39:35,150
Okay.

2843
01:39:35,850 --> 01:39:37,710
I don't understand!

2844
01:39:41,750 --> 01:39:43,550
Just... grasping!

2845
01:39:43,730 --> 01:39:44,470
Alright.

2846
01:39:44,810 --> 01:39:45,990
Like this.

2847
01:39:46,070 --> 01:39:47,670
This part we got down.

2848
01:39:47,890 --> 01:39:50,130
Hands down the easiest part.

2849
01:39:50,670 --> 01:39:51,430
Okay.

2850
01:39:53,710 --> 01:39:55,890
This part is the easiest part for us.

2851
01:39:56,810 --> 01:39:57,570
But...

2852
01:39:57,570 --> 01:40:00,070
For some reason...

2853
01:40:01,110 --> 01:40:02,290
There we go.

2854
01:40:02,710 --> 01:40:04,210
For some reason...

2855
01:40:05,070 --> 01:40:07,490
We can't do the other part!

2856
01:40:08,050 --> 01:40:08,330
No!

2857
01:40:09,890 --> 01:40:13,550
I wasn't... I didn't grab on the edge enough!

2858
01:40:14,670 --> 01:40:18,750
I've been playing for so long that my background music stopped!

2859
01:40:19,050 --> 01:40:21,630
My background music was like, are you sure?

2860
01:40:22,230 --> 01:40:23,850
Are you sure?

2861
01:40:27,870 --> 01:40:28,470
Please!

2862
01:40:32,470 --> 01:40:35,750
You're like, are you sure you wanna keep going, Doki?

2863
01:40:36,250 --> 01:40:38,490
This is getting embarrassing now.

2864
01:40:41,890 --> 01:40:43,330
I wanna settle.

2865
01:40:43,590 --> 01:40:44,610
I wanna settle.

2866
01:40:46,070 --> 01:40:46,650
That's all I want.

2867
01:40:46,950 --> 01:40:48,730
Just let me get there.

2868
01:40:48,870 --> 01:40:50,710
Let me get to that one area.

2869
01:40:51,050 --> 01:40:51,790
That's all.

2870
01:40:53,090 --> 01:40:54,630
Like, I don't want much.

2871
01:40:55,130 --> 01:40:57,150
Just let me be in my sanctuary.

2872
01:41:00,250 --> 01:41:00,770
Please.

2873
01:41:01,890 --> 01:41:03,850
If I make it to the first checkpoint.

2874
01:41:04,850 --> 01:41:06,010
That's all I want.

2875
01:41:08,930 --> 01:41:10,650
That's all I want.

2876
01:41:11,470 --> 01:41:11,990
No!

2877
01:41:12,150 --> 01:41:14,390
I don't care about the city anymore!

2878
01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:17,110
It's not worth it!

2879
01:41:20,270 --> 01:41:20,750
Okay.

2880
01:41:20,990 --> 01:41:21,290
Okay.

2881
01:41:21,850 --> 01:41:23,350
The city is not worth it.

2882
01:41:23,470 --> 01:41:25,950
I realize the city was a lie.

2883
01:41:28,510 --> 01:41:29,990
It was a lie all along.

2884
01:41:35,910 --> 01:41:36,390
Please.

2885
01:41:38,070 --> 01:41:38,550
No.

2886
01:41:38,550 --> 01:41:45,030
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no No, no, no, no...

2887
01:41:46,370 --> 01:41:46,710
Okay.

2888
01:41:49,650 --> 01:41:50,330
Please.

2889
01:41:51,370 --> 01:41:52,050
Please.

2890
01:41:53,390 --> 01:41:53,730
Okay.

2891
01:41:54,050 --> 01:41:54,830
You gotta focus.

2892
01:41:55,030 --> 01:41:56,170
You gotta focus, Doki.

2893
01:41:58,010 --> 01:41:58,810
Just focus.

2894
01:41:59,450 --> 01:42:00,510
Just focus.

2895
01:42:01,650 --> 01:42:03,150
Just keep focusing.

2896
01:42:05,050 --> 01:42:05,730
Goodbye.

2897
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:10,140
Oh god.

2898
01:42:12,240 --> 01:42:12,920
Okay.

2899
01:42:15,060 --> 01:42:16,460
Just keep focusing.

2900
01:42:18,220 --> 01:42:20,320
Just grab onto the top!

2901
01:42:22,100 --> 01:42:24,400
Just grab onto the top!

2902
01:42:27,690 --> 01:42:28,410
Oh god.

2903
01:42:28,550 --> 01:42:29,170
Oh god.

2904
01:42:29,330 --> 01:42:30,330
Just keep focusing.

2905
01:42:30,930 --> 01:42:32,090
Just keep focusing.

2906
01:42:32,170 --> 01:42:32,810
The promised land.

2907
01:42:33,170 --> 01:42:35,030
The promised land is right there.

2908
01:42:38,030 --> 01:42:39,090
Don't fuck up.

2909
01:42:40,590 --> 01:42:41,870
Don't fuck up!

2910
01:42:42,310 --> 01:42:42,950
YES!

2911
01:42:43,930 --> 01:42:44,990
WE DID IT!

2912
01:42:51,670 --> 01:42:53,070
Okay, we can keep going.

2913
01:42:53,270 --> 01:42:53,950
No!

2914
01:42:54,490 --> 01:42:55,510
I'm settling.

2915
01:42:55,690 --> 01:42:56,170
I'm settling.

2916
01:42:56,610 --> 01:42:57,890
I'm gonna settle.

2917
01:42:58,770 --> 01:42:59,990
I'm gonna settle.

2918
01:43:00,350 --> 01:43:01,590
I'm calling it.

2919
01:43:04,950 --> 01:43:08,610
This is my new home now.

2920
01:43:08,870 --> 01:43:10,770
I'm done with FOMO.

2921
01:43:11,550 --> 01:43:13,570
I'm done with FOMO.

2922
01:43:16,830 --> 01:43:18,370
I beat the game.

2923
01:43:18,530 --> 01:43:19,030
Time!

2924
01:43:19,590 --> 01:43:20,270
Time!

2925
01:43:23,050 --> 01:43:24,890
FOMO is no more.

2926
01:43:25,330 --> 01:43:27,730
I've made it.

2927
01:43:27,730 --> 01:43:29,550
No more FOMO for me.

2928
01:43:34,370 --> 01:43:36,190
We did it!

2929
01:43:40,610 --> 01:43:41,710
Oh my god.

2930
01:43:41,770 --> 01:43:43,710
Thank you everybody for watching.

2931
01:43:44,050 --> 01:43:44,830
I'm done.

2932
01:43:45,090 --> 01:43:47,170
I'm sorry this is a short stream.

2933
01:43:47,510 --> 01:43:50,850
But I don't wanna risk losing my life.

2934
01:43:50,870 --> 01:43:51,570
I'm gonna lose my sanctuary.

2935
01:43:51,970 --> 01:43:54,250
I don't wanna risk it.

2936
01:43:54,530 --> 01:43:55,430
Okay guys.

2937
01:43:57,050 --> 01:44:01,010
Whenever we hit 800,000 subscribers.

2938
01:44:01,610 --> 01:44:02,910
Wait, where are we at?

2939
01:44:03,030 --> 01:44:04,590
Alright, 700,000 subscribers.

2940
01:44:04,830 --> 01:44:09,830
When we hit 700,000 subscribers, I will finish the game.

2941
01:44:10,050 --> 01:44:11,790
I will finish the game.

2942
01:44:16,690 --> 01:44:17,390
700K subscribers.

2943
01:44:17,390 --> 01:44:19,750
And I will finish the game.

2944
01:44:20,110 --> 01:44:23,610
But for now, this Eddy has to...

2945
01:44:23,610 --> 01:44:25,270
He's gonna peace out.

2946
01:44:30,130 --> 01:44:31,050
Alright guys.

2947
01:44:31,330 --> 01:44:33,210
I think we have a lot of super chats coming in.

2948
01:44:33,310 --> 01:44:34,790
So I'm gonna call it here everybody.

2949
01:44:35,290 --> 01:44:37,110
But like, thank you all for calling.

2950
01:44:37,170 --> 01:44:39,470
I hope you guys enjoyed today's stream.

2951
01:44:39,910 --> 01:44:40,430
Everyone.

2952
01:44:40,750 --> 01:44:42,610
It was very chaotic.

2953
01:44:44,410 --> 01:44:45,950
As always everybody.

2954
01:44:45,950 --> 01:44:47,710
Stay hydrated.

2955
01:44:48,330 --> 01:44:49,030
Posture check.

2956
01:44:49,150 --> 01:44:51,210
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

2957
01:44:51,390 --> 01:44:52,910
And if you stay up for me.

2958
01:44:53,070 --> 01:44:54,010
Head to bed.

2959
01:44:54,210 --> 01:44:55,570
Cause you deserve it.

2960
01:44:55,670 --> 01:44:56,810
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

2961
01:44:57,330 --> 01:44:58,090
Bye guys.

2962
01:44:58,570 --> 01:44:59,010
Bye.
