1
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,640
Welcome to Blind Spot.

2
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,240
Actually, let's make that PUBG Blind Spot.

3
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,560
It's a 5v5 PvP game from a top-down view.

4
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,700
But watch your step.

5
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,340
Into the darkness lies the blind spot.

6
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,280
You can't see them, but they can see you.

7
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,380
Danger is literally around every spot.

8
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,700
Plant the bomb, defend the site.

9
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,520
Haven't I played this a million times before?

10
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:29,620
Well, hold that thought, because this is where we change the
rules.

11
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,720
Pick a route and let's break in.

12
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,780
Wait, hold up.

13
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:37,760
Keep it down.

14
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,640
Use your elbow.

15
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,080
Slip in quietly.

16
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,880
Watch every blind spot.

17
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,460
Shields up the front.

18
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,220
Use everything you've got.

19
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,960
Maybe Red Chip Amplifier this time.

20
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,260
Stealth mode.

21
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:53,820
Ambush.

22
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,280
Or flashbang.

23
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:55,800
Ambush.

24
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,220
Breaching hook.

25
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,320
Blue chip detector.

26
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,140
Ambush.

27
00:04:59,640 --> 00:04:59,960
Wait.

28
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,480
What if they're waiting to ambush us?

29
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,520
As long as we've got your back, you'll clear that path
eventually.

30
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,360
Alright, here we are at the crypt site.

31
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,660
Man, look at that defense.

32
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,640
Let's bust these barricades open.

33
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,540
It's your showtime.

34
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,120
Smash it.

35
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,120
Blow it up.

36
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:22,960
Everything.

37
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,860
Time to plant the decryptor.

38
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,180
But heads up, this is their last stand.

39
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,240
And they won't go down easily.

40
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,120
Pop smoke and blind the defense.

41
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,060
Still too many hostiles?

42
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,500
Screw it.

43
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,120
Just force your way in and tank it with the shield.

44
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,460
Now, planting is the ideal way to win, sure.

45
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:51,620
But...

46
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,800
And you're the last one standing?

47
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,300
Then lock in.

48
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,780
It's time to make a highlight reel.

49
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,060
Double kill.

50
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:03,600
Triple kill.

51
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:04,960
Quadra kill.

52
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:06,740
Clutch.

53
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,200
Every angle counts.

54
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,860
PUBG Blindspot.

55
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,120

They're like, we want to sponsor you to organize the very
first NA tournament for this game.

89

And I was very scared.

00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:49,240
Because I haven't organized or hosted a tournament in a long
time because I've been very, very busy.

91
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,300
And at first I was like, are you sure I could just be a
participant?

92
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,800
And you're like, no, we want to have your name, your brand
on this tournament.

Blindspot launches into early access.

105
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,660
A new era begins together with Doki Bird.

106
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,060
Hey, that's me!

107
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,260
This isn't just an update.

108
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,580
Strategy, mind games, and an entire new formula to win.

109
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,920
You're about to witness the evolution of gameplay.

110
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,120
Who will be the first to show us these grand changes?

111
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,040
These are the players that I have my eyes on.

112
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:54,540
They have their own style, own personality, and are ready to
bring the fun.

113
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:02,260
Some of them might take big risks, so we'll just play for
Chaos, and others might be the surprise star.

114
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,680
Don't you wanna know what they'll show us?

115
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,400
This match is gonna carry my name.

116
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,180
It's no small game.

117
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:17,500
That's right, a total of 15,000 USD, and the winner takes
$7,000.

118
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,800
That's a lot of money.

119
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,480
Check it out yourself to see who takes the spotlight.

120

story originally uh the trailer uh was not narrated by me um

139
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:45,330
but when we were going over it we were like oh it feels a
little you know we want to add more like you know because it

140
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:50,850
is a dokeyberg tournament and they were like how about you
narrate this instead of like you know the voiceover because

141
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:58,470
at first i was like whoa the the guy voicing this i feel
like you know he needs more personality in there more oomph

142
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:04,350
to it and they're like how about you narrate this and then i
accidentally did not see the message for two days and the

143
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:16,870
deadline was like in two days and i was like oh my god i'm
so sorry i i'm so out of it and i was like i i did it i And

160
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:24,550
battlegrounds it's not a battle royale in fact it's its own
little thing so you guys might have remembered me playing

161
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:33,150
this before in a previous sponsor as well so the best part
of this game is that it's free to play so you can actually

162
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:41,850
try to gain yourself right now in early access and it's
basically like a top-down 5v5 tactical So you know the drill

163
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:47,530
regarding tactical shooters, so you have a defense and
attack side round and your goal is to either prevent the

164
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:50,650
team from planting the bomb or be the one to plant the bomb.

165
00:16:50,890 --> 00:17:00,210
So, you know, you remember when during the last time I
played this game in the earlier early axis, like the guy

166
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:02,030
that we were against, he was like against the wall.

167
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,050
And I was like, I'm going to breach that wall.

168
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:10,430
And I just like, I just like, I destroyed the wall and he
was just right there.

169
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:11,630
I was like, shoot him!

170
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:15,490
So, I hope we get a lot.

171
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:20,030
I'm definitely going to be breaching a lot of walls next
week.

172
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,330
I'm going to be like, guys, don't worry.

173
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:24,150
He's definitely going to be on that other side.

174
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,090
I'm going to breach that wall.

175
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:33,670
Anyway, so yeah, you can destroy walls, wallbang, as you
guys saw in the trailer.

176
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:37,670
Shoot someone with a grenade launcher, which obviously won't
get...

177
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,370
I'm going to try that one time.

178
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,050
And it's definitely not going to back.

179
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:46,610
I feel like when you guys see my team, you're going to know
like one of us is going to try that.

180
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,950
And I'm definitely not going to go wrong.

181
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,190
Definitely nothing's going to go badly from that.

182
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:57,710
And you can use all types of util for an advantage.

183
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:01,370
And a lot of the utility is mapped to a specific agent.

184
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:07,750
So like each agent has its own utility, its own specific
guns and everything.

185
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:17,530
which agent is perfect for your playstyle uh but yeah also
another great thing is that there's shared vision combat so

186
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:26,110
what that means is that your team shares enemy sightings and
lines a sight in real time so whether your teammate sees you

187
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:36,030
can see as well so basically your teammate can give you wall
hacks as long as they aren't incompetent and die just just

188
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:48,930
don't die that's all we ask always have wall hacks as long
as they don't die oh i see also don't worry if you are not

189
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:55,210
like very into like the whole 5v5 tactical part of the
gameplay there is team death match um if you want to check

190
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:59,750
out the game yourself like i said there is team death match
for those who just don't want to go just want to go

191
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:06,990
ungabunga uh but uh but in the tournament we are going to be
playing the um the other game mode which is the search and

192
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:17,070
destroy so the attack and defense uh so yeah anyway next
slide which i control so i'm telling myself next slide uh

193
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:24,830
nsd welcome thank you for the five gift and chips thank you
thank you all right so there are some patch notes that uh so

194
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:32,310
i have to let you guys know for those who have played the
earlier access and have seen the previous stream i've done

195
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:39,270
for the sponsor stream um they have changed some things um
in this game compared to the last time we looked into it so

196
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:42,910
Anyway, small dokey will be a smaller dokey now.

197
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:54,910
Alright, so anyway, so the first thing that they added that
we didn't see before is they added this thing called down

198
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:55,850
but not out.

199
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:00,330
So in the previous sponsor, we didn't see this ability
before.

200
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:07,670
So basically, I know this is going to be super funny when we
do this in the tournament.

201
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:16,770
lot of things are going to go wrong when this happens in the
tournament uh but basically what this means is that when you

202
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:27,850
kill someone they don't fall dive so they they're they're
down so you need to double tap them to kill someone uh so

203
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:40,150
there is a revive system which they added for in the early
axis so they enter a down state and you i can't I can

204
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:52,290
already imagine one of my teammates who you will find out
later on who it is is gonna be shouting Rizmi he's gonna be

205
00:20:52,290 --> 00:21:07,110
shouting Rizmi come on Rizmi I'm safe it's not me okay it's
not me okay technically it's my entire team my entire team

206
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:20,890
is is that player uh christmas i'm so safe guys i swear to
god and the okay but another plus side of this new update is

207
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:35,750
that um they also can they can crawl so so so if you don't
fully kill someone um they can crawl up i can't imagine you

208
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:44,750
knock someone they just crawl away like where do they go um
but they can crawl away and they do also share vision um

209
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:56,270
they can also share vision even though if even if they're
crawling um um so the shame crawled i just want to do this

210
00:21:56,270 --> 00:22:03,090
okay if i have a chance in the tournament i definitely i'm
gonna knock someone down and just watch them crawl away i'll

211
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:10,190
be like all right boy lead me to the rest of your teammates
i know you want to oh you're gonna revive you.

212
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:12,350
Oh, that's so cute.

213
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:13,310
Yes, come on.

214
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,770
Lead me to them.

215
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:25,570
Yeah, I can see some people doing that next week.

216
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:30,570
Anyway, another thing that they have changed, I believe.

217
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:36,470
Yeah, they have adjusted him before they wall bang you.

218
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:41,210
He takes you to one of the walls and you get I don't that's
that at that point.

219
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:48,690
That's just karma as I played with my food for too long
Other things they have added a mini map Shooting mechanisms

220
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:49,890
have improved.

221
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:57,250
They have changed some of the stuff on the maps So like if
you notice some things from the early earlier access like

222
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:57,880
the ones before

223
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:11,130
They have changed a few of these things and I had and also
expanded you could decrypt your placement range um i believe

224
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:18,710
has been yeah they have like a placement range to it now
anyway so these are patch note number one patch note number

225
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:27,570
two that they wanted me to let you guys know is that they
have added a new character yeah so there's a new new agent

226
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:39,470
here his name is blaze a new operator uh he uses he has a
molotov gadget and also uses the ump 45 the ump 45 so This

227
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:42,910
is the new operator that they added for the newest early
access.

228
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:52,090
And then there's a bunch of adjustments to a bunch of the
other characters like Buddy, Zen, Patch, and Hayes.

229
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:59,470
So if you guys have played this game before, these
characters have been adjusted for the current early access.

230
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,350
So they are a little bit different.

231
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:04,590
So Zen, for example, he is only attack only.

232
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:06,370
You could have played him in defense and attack.

233
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:07,430
Now he's attack only.

234
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:17,810
only to attack defense, so you can play her in both attack
defense and change some stuff regarding Hayes' kit in

235
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:21,150
general, so you can't... What the?

236
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:27,890
Okay, I didn't even realize this, but in the past, he had a
weapon that had headshot one hit kill.

237
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:31,030
They thankfully removed that.

238
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,110
Thank God.

239
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:35,110
That... You know what?

240
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:37,150
No, that does seem a little broken.

241
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:39,350
So, that's gone now.

242
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:40,290
Don't worry.

243
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,590
That is God now.

244
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:44,570
He does not one shot headshot kill now.

245
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:53,990
So luckily we're safe Um, so they didn't balance that out
and yeah, they changed buddy's uh gadget as well So now he

246
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:57,430
has what a camera drone toy penetration gadget.

247
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:02,110
So that used to be haze's oh my god Hey, oh yeah, I remember
haze had the penetration.

248
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:04,030
Oh yeah, haze was crazy broken.

249
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:15,190
I remember now So yeah, he doesn't have any of that anymore
thank god uh all right those are all the new changes for the

250
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:25,150
current um for the current build of the early access so you
were used if you did play this before if all of these things

251
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:34,450
changed as well and we got a new new operator blaze all
right next up team captains yes so team captains this

252
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:43,430
tournament has um it has v-tubers and fleshy's so it's a mix
of both um and the two team captains as it was announced

253
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:56,490
earlier is me that's me jokie bear uh lily peachy uh muda
and sub sub rose i rosa sorry sub rosa i apologize if i

254
00:25:56,490 --> 00:26:03,750
mispronounce your names i english is my very first language
but unfortunately i am a little bit illiterate i am very

255
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:14,570
sorry but these are the team captains it is a team of five
for each team so they each pick we each picked our own

256
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:26,250
teammates for this tournament alright next up prizes the
prize money tournament structure so as I said before this is

257
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:34,890
a $15,000 tournament and it is fully funded fully sponsored
by PUBG blind spot again thank you again Yay!

258
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:38,770
Thank you for funding the entire tournament and also helping
me with the assets.

259
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:42,890
And they also are helping with the casting and the
production.

260
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:51,730
So the production side of the tournament stream is going to
be a very, what's the word?

261
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:57,190
Very high quality because they actually got like a cat, like
they actually got real casters instead of like, you know, me

262
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:57,690
and Mint.

263
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:01,410
Trying to cast this.

264
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:04,430
So they got actual professional casters for this.

265
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:10,430
tournament and also a professional production team uh for
like the camera shots and everything and the swapping

266
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:17,230
between scenes so i won't be controlling the uh i won't be
solo controlling the entire tournament stream this time like

267
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:23,810
i have in the previous uh things i've organized so there's
going to be an actual professional production team that's

268
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:33,290
handling all of that so huge shout out to pubg blind spot
for taking care of all this for me um anyway so first place

269
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:41,730
is $7,000, second place is $3,000, and third place is
$2,000.

270
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:50,430
So everybody, everybody wins, except for last place, but
everybody, everyone gets money, except for last, everyone

271
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:51,430
gets money.

272
00:27:55,990 --> 00:28:00,910
Anyway, other than that, we do also have a special prize.

273
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:02,810
It's just, just don't get last,

274
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:25,870
um anyway so there are special everyone wins um not actually
the fine print um and yeah the fine print anyway so so there

275
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:37,150
are also uh special prizes so each individual uh whoever the
individual who gets MVP, where MVP, the most valued player

276
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:40,710
in the entire tournament, gets an additional $2,000.

277
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:44,890
And the kill leader can also get $1,000.

278
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:53,610
So we do have these two as the special incentives for those
who want to, you know, be like extra sweaty.

279
00:28:54,150 --> 00:29:00,610
So an individual can potentially even get both $2,000 or
$1,000 at the same time.

280
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:02,610
and MVP.

281
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:08,610
So technically, last place could technically get Kill
Leader, guys.

282
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:10,610
They could technically do it.

283
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:21,830
And I believe, wait, let me message, let me message, just to
be sure.

284
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:27,170
Because I wasn't fully sure about this one detail about how
MVP is selected.

285
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:32,010
So let me shoot this message real quick, just to be sure,
because I remember we were talking about this before.

286
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:39,870
um so um so i just want to fully confirm before i say it
because that'll be a little awkward if i said it and then

287
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:49,790
the organizers are like um that's uh that's not how we're
doing it so um regarding how mvp is selected anyway so other

288
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:57,670
than that this is the schedule uh february 6th right now uh
at 3 p.m pst which i just started uh the announcement stream

289
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,810
of all the tournament of the tournament itself.

290
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,950
February 15th and 16th.

291
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:05,810
Like I said, it starts at the exact same time as this
announcement stream.

292
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:10,130
But Group Stage will be at 3 p.m.

293
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:19,750
PST for day one, and Grand Finals will also be at 3 p.m.

294
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:21,510
PST.

295
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:31,730
So just letting you guys know, we try to keep it very easy
to remember Every day of this tournament is at 3 p.m.

296
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:38,190
PST, so we're not like, you know, jump-scaring everyone on
how it's done.

297
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:49,570
Okay, so I'm just confirming how MVP is selected for this
right now.

298
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:58,590
But yeah, so group stage is most likely it, okay, not most
likely it is, I am the, I don't know why I said that.

299
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:08,510
most likely when I am in the tournament but it is a group
stage round robin-esque and then the grand final is where

300
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:22,930
like the elimination actually starts next slide there we go
I knew it the overview there we go so format uh I oh all

301
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:34,110
right so MVP this is how MVP is going to be selected all
right so it'll be very uh awkward if there was a different

302
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:40,090
plan apparently i was not on the same wavelength um they're
like i think what you want is what we will do so they assume

303
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:48,250
that we are on the same wavelength so okay so this is what i
thought basically mvp will be selected by a vote on my

304
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:59,990
channel and then i and guys you know you could also vote for
me because i'm also on the tournament too so But anyway, but

305
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:02,790
no, no, I'm not rigging the votes guys.

306
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:03,870
We're not I'm not rig.

307
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:10,090
I'm just giving a Suggestion Wait a minute.

308
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:15,190
So it will be the vote where MVP guys.

309
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:16,570
It's just it's just a suggestion.

310
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:22,390
I'm not rigging anything Um, I was giving an example of how
you can vote.

311
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:37,150
So it will be a It'll be a vote on the dokey bird Rick got
it Ricky get it no no no no no no no disclaimer I'll give it

312
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:45,070
a little disclaimer I was just giving an example just a
little you know a little example on how it could work you

313
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:52,250
know it would be like alright who you guys want for MVP oh
dokey bird alright let's put her name on the pull guys and

314
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:59,690
it's like dokey bird and all the other options and if
somehow dokey bird wins she gets MVP and $2,000.

315
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:07,690
But you guys can vote for anyone, even for someone who was
on last place, too.

316
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:08,210
You know?

317
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:11,290
You can also vote for someone who was on last place.

318
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:14,690
It could also be me there, in last place, so.

319
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:24,490
But anyway, that is how the MVP system will go.

320
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:28,350
So you all have a choice.

321
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:41,990
on who mvp is not me but you chat the power is in your hands
guys on who you want to vote for on the dokeybird channel um

322
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:54,870
who your oh she is also uh who happens to also be dokeybird
so it's it's your choice on how this is gonna go uh sure

323
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:13,910
but it could be anyone it could be anyone it could be anyone
um anyway so so day one uh day day day one all right guys

324
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:21,690
how about okay i think it would be more fair i you know i'm
so humble i'm so humble and like i'm for the people you know

325
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:32,150
so i my own decision i will take myself out of the vote
because I want this tournament to be fair and just and I

326
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:41,590
know so many people will see me as the most valued player
going in as a person with the most experience going in but

327
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:54,830
because I am so humble and and I want other people to have a
chance to win MVP I will take myself of the vote to give

328
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:59,350
everyone a fair opportunity uh hashtag humble

329
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:16,190
um anyway so day one will be four teams group stage so it is
a round robin um but um the fourth team will get eliminated

330
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,990
before day two.

331
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:21,730
You're anti-green, disgusting.

332
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:31,310
Anyway, so the last place team, the fourth team, will get
eliminated on day one.

333
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:39,630
And then on day two, we will go through the deciding matches
between, it'll just be like elimination from the last

334
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,630
remaining teams.

335
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:56,650
Another thing to add, uh about this uh I already forgot what
it's gonna say there's no other thing to add that's it that

336
00:35:56,650 --> 00:36:05,750
I mean the format is pretty straightforward four teams fight
it out the team that loses the most gets eliminated on day

337
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:13,950
one and oh yeah um we made sure to make the tournament not
too long we find it on into one day because we were worried

338
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:21,110
that it might be too long and people will get tired so uh
because of that we split it into two days and then you know

339
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:26,470
after tournament they can do whatever they want um so day
two would be a lot shorter compared to day one and all

340
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:34,530
matches will be played simultaneously so uh the broadcast
will only cover selected matches uh so like there's like a

341
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:39,450
match if you want broadcast this match but every game will
be played simultaneously so they don't have to wait in

342
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:45,110
between games you know that's like obviously the worst part
that's why i hate the most when you gotta wait like one to

343
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:52,930
two hours towards the next game so yeah every game will be
played at once uh to give everyone uh to give every like you

344
00:36:52,930 --> 00:37:02,250
know to move things on like forward in a nice timely manner
um all right next slide whoa captains again all right so

345
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:14,130
who's gonna be on whose team uh i will start first you will
now understand why i say my team my team is gonna be a

346
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:24,510
little messy if we manage to work together and not yell at
each other i will call that a win and i created this team by

347
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:36,510
the way i personally created this team knowing what's gonna
happen all right anyway so my team all right tanya tanydoki

348
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:44,030
again it will be Me, Kony, Heavenly Father, Super Gomez, and
Sheriff War.

349
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:55,570
So, um, it was, I was actually the last person to submit my
team because, like, like I said, I had someone drop out last

350
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:57,690
minute because, uh, they weren't feeling so good.

351
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:59,590
So they were like, oh, I don't think I could do a
tournament.

352
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:00,450
So it was like, it's okay.

353
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:13,770
And then I also was like, um, so each of us, That's why I'm
saying like each of us would be the one to shout res me Like

354
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:25,290
why didn't you res me each of us it could be any one of us
Um So um It was actually really difficult to create this

355
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:33,110
team because like everyone was apparently like very busy too
so like I message uh, I message a lot of people and I'm very

356
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:39,530
thankful Uh to all the people that said yes to be part of my
team and to participate in this tournament.

357
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:47,570
So huge shout out to Kony, Heavenly Father, Trooper Gomez,
and sure for joining this tournament and being on my team.

358
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:50,110
Um, this team, yeah.

359
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:52,530
I forgot.

360
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:53,690
Was there team kills?

361
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:54,970
Was there friendly fire?

362
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:56,290
I don't remember.

363
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:58,750
I think there, there wasn't, right?

364
00:38:58,750 --> 00:38:59,370
Oh, thank God.

365
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:00,770
There was no friendly fire, guys.

366
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:01,330
Thank God.

367
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:02,150
I just remembered.

368
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,450
Uh, wait, there is.

369
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:05,430
Oh, no.

370
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:06,510
Wait, never mind.

371
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:07,630
There was friendly fire.

372
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:08,850
My mistake.

373
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:10,330
Okay, this is gonna...

374
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:13,030
Okay, I don't remember, but then I remember.

375
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:15,970
There is friendly fire, so this is gonna be a little messy.

376
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:17,010
Let's hope...

377
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:23,690
There's only one way to find out if there's friendly fire or
not.

378
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:25,730
But anyway, this is my team.

379
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:34,470
Next up, we have Lily Peachy and the Beasties.

380
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:37,930
So, yes, all of the Beasties will be participating.

381
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:47,050
i also want to do another disclaimer we warned her about how
sweaty this this tournament might be oh just just a little

382
00:39:47,050 --> 00:40:00,450
we're not sending we're not sending a child out to die guys
we warned them also also it is a top-down shooter so like so

383
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:08,530
like if they see the person first if they see the person
first um they can they they can win the fight i believe.

384
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:10,970
Okay, I believe in them.

385
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:11,430
All right.

386
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:15,190
I, we all love the underdog story and I believe in them.

387
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:22,650
So it is Lily Peachy, Berrybug, PFP, Tori, and Kyrieu.

388
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:25,170
Um, that will be on Lily Peachy's team.

389
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:26,990
And I believe in Lily Peachy.

390
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:32,230
I believe she can lead her team, uh, to victory and not
last.

391
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:33,370
I believe in her.

392
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:36,230
Um, but I'm not being last though.

393
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:39,130
Like if anyone has to be last, I hope it.

394
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:40,610
I'm sorry, Lily.

395
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:44,910
If it's me and you and one of us has to be last, I'm sorry.

396
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:50,310
But, but, but I do not want to be last.

397
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:55,070
All right.

398
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:58,770
The next team will be Team Muda.

399
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:07,190
So in Muda's team, it'll be Cloudy X3, Kamali, NelFPS, and
Dashnerf.

400
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:09,610
is Muda's team.

401
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:12,890
But yeah, there they are.

402
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:13,410
Yay!

403
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:24,570
I believe they are all very talented in shooters in general.

404
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:29,770
So, oh my god, there are looks maxing right now.

405
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:34,450
Yeah, from what I was told, they are gamers.

406
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:35,290
Gamers.

407
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:42,790
So, if it's between me and Lily Peachy, To be not last, I am
sorry, Lily, but I will lock in so hard.

408
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:49,590
I do not want to be like Super, who got knocked out of his
own tournament.

409
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:55,310
I have to show up on day two, Lily.

410
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:56,550
I'm sorry.

411
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:59,390
I have to show up on day two.

412
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:01,470
I can't give you mercy.

413
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:06,370
All right.

414
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:14,970
All right, last team, the very final team, will be Team
Subrosa.

415
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:22,070
So it will be a GMDD Dynamic, Simone, FPS, and N-Pride.

416
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:25,690
I do recognize some of the people on this team.

417
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:29,430
They are all also very good at various shooter games.

418
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:32,890
And also, I know, yeah, all the teams are pretty stacked.

419
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:38,010
I know, like, some of them are actually, were pros in other
games.

420
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:42,910
So, uh, yeah, I know that some of these are gamer gamers who
have been pro players.

421
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:45,030
I mean, one of them is literally wearing their jersey shirt.

422
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:51,710
So one of them is literally wearing their, their esports
sport team.

423
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:56,810
So I assume they are all, I mean, the other guy has two of
them have FPS in their name.

424
00:42:56,930 --> 00:43:00,810
So I, I assume they're very good at FPS, guys.

425
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:07,490
I, it would be, I mean, if you put FPS as your gamer tag,
you, you must be good at FPS.

426
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:12,170
Because then that would be a little embarrassing if
you're...

427
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:13,990
It's just there for fun.

428
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:19,230
But yeah, anyway, that was Subrosa's team.

429
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:20,930
And that was all the teams.

430
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:23,690
All the teams for the tournament.

431
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:27,650
They were invited by the team captains.

432
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:32,070
We're invited by PUBG Blindspot.

433
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:38,110
And we allowed the team captains to select the teammates
that they wanted to participate.

434
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:44,250

could you know we could be surprised because it is a top

458
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:47,110
down tactical shooter and it's usually I feel like it's
peekers advantage because of it because it's like whoever

459
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:54,410
sees the person's first because it's top down so as long as
you put like you know you point your mouse directly at

460
00:46:54,410 --> 00:47:07,470
someone like you know they'll die like that's on paper
that's how it works so it could you know anyone can win you

467
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:04,750
That would be pretty awkward.

468
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:09,010
My Timmy's and Yimmy's will cheer me on.

469
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:10,650

00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:23,610
I don't remember.

475
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:24,710
I don't know if it...

476
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:25,770
I think it rolls over.

477
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:27,290
Yeah, this looks like it rolled over.

478
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:37,570
okay and there was like there was something that i was just
like i was like on and off about and it was the where was it

479
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:44,730
it was the one where it's like wherever you're facing is
where you're shooting at show control show blackout pings

482
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:18,170

484
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:48,620

go to the next location I love ruining.

486
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:58,840
What do you mean?

487
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:01,920
Alright, fire at target.

488
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:06,680
Yeah, they changed the tutorial a little bit.

489
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:08,840
It's different.

490
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:13,790
Oh, aim low.

491
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:14,170
Okay.

492
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:17,330
Aim low at target area.

493
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:18,590
Too close to the wall.

494
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:19,110
What do you mean?

495
00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:20,190
Too close to the wall.

496
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:24,990
I'm reloading?

497
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:30,590
Aim low at target.

498
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:42,690
oh my god it's so different now or maybe yeah it feel it
definitely feels different i swear to god i made me low what

499
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:54,410
am i doing wrong what am i i am pressing control this is
control oh my god i re-binded it that's why wait i remember

500
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:58,330
i re-binded the controls Give me a sec.

501
00:50:58,410 --> 00:50:59,990
I forgot what I binded it to.

502
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:01,070
It's not them.

503
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:01,670
It's me.

504
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:03,490
I re-binded the controls.

505
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:08,550
I remember now.

506
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:09,670
I was like, I don't understand.

507
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:13,090
Because like, control was not crouched at first.

508
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:14,550
And then I was like, I don't like that.

509
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:16,730
I'm gonna make it control is crouched.

510
00:51:17,090 --> 00:51:18,910
And I realized, wait a minute.

511
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:20,650
Wait a minute.

512
00:51:21,490 --> 00:51:23,230
That makes more sense now.

513
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:28,450
What was it?

514
00:51:28,990 --> 00:51:30,530
What did I put it as?

515
00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:33,390
I don't remember.

516
00:51:34,270 --> 00:51:35,150
It's, okay, okay.

517
00:51:35,770 --> 00:51:36,790
Mouse, aim.

518
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:37,930
Oh, it's C.

519
00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:39,850
Oh my god, it was C.

520
00:51:40,210 --> 00:51:42,810
Why did I put it as C, Doki?

521
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:45,190
It's not, it carried over.

522
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:46,770
It actually carried over.

523
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:52,290
All the past Doki's control was carried over into this game.

524
00:51:54,810 --> 00:51:55,990
Past Doki.

525
00:51:56,670 --> 00:51:57,870
I was in C.

526
00:51:58,610 --> 00:52:00,150
I don't understand.

527
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:03,790
Alright.

528
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:05,790
Why did I put it?

529
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:06,090
Yeah.

530
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:06,970
I don't.

531
00:52:07,170 --> 00:52:08,550
Why did I put it?

532
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:09,230

533
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:14,630

539
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:26,650

It's okay.

566
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:20,790
Just a little friendly fire.

567
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:22,250
I'm just practicing.

568
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:26,370
Just practicing friendly fire for my team.

569
00:54:26,990 --> 00:54:27,650
It down all.

570
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:32,640
I don't know about it.

571
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,800
Wait, can I hit from...

572
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,160
Can I wallbang glass?

573
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:37,700

00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:39,440
Oh, wait.

575
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:40,600
That's the grenade, right?

576
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,100
Yeah, look at that.

577
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,040
I think...

578
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:50,140
Yeah, I remember, like, in the end, I liked facing towards
where I'm planning on shooting.

579
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:53,420
I felt like that was, like, the most convenient overall.

580
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:54,560
All right.

581
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:55,620

There you go.

701
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:29,960
Double HP?

702
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:31,600

703
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:33,500

01:09:36,030 --> 01:09:36,550
Watch out!

801
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:39,030
They'll never see.

802
01:09:39,990 --> 01:09:41,010
Oh my god, they saw.

803
01:09:44,290 --> 01:09:45,530
They'll never know.

804
01:09:47,150 --> 01:09:47,990
I lost my sensor.

805
01:09:48,510 --> 01:09:50,470
Don't worry, they'll never... I got the second sensor.

806
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:51,610
Oh, there you go.

807
01:09:52,010 --> 01:09:52,570
See?

808
01:09:53,490 --> 01:09:55,290
They never expect a second sensor.

809
01:09:56,270 --> 01:09:56,850
Oh, shit.

810
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:05,360
Guys, I'm scared.

811
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:08,980
Wait, I have bomb.

812
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:10,140
Oh, my bad.

813
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:14,100
Wait, no, everyone has bomb, right?

814
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:15,200
What's that thing?

815
01:10:24,740 --> 01:10:25,920
All right, I'm planting.

816
01:10:29,140 --> 01:10:31,700
Cover me, cover me, cover me, cover me, cover me.

817
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:33,400
Right there, yep, there we go.

818
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:41,140
Motion sensor, placed.

819
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:44,840
They were...

820
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:47,020
Oh, no.

821
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:49,360
One enemy left.

822
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:50,740
They won't know.

823
01:10:56,450 --> 01:10:57,050
Yeah!

824
01:10:58,570 --> 01:11:00,010
I didn't have to do anything.

825
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:02,190
Let's go!

826
01:11:04,990 --> 01:11:05,430
Yay!

827
01:11:06,990 --> 01:11:09,090
Wait, that motion sensor goes hard, though.

828
01:11:09,490 --> 01:11:10,470
Wait, I figured it out.

829
01:11:13,670 --> 01:11:14,290
No, no, no.

830
01:11:14,390 --> 01:11:16,690
I was the backup flag.

831
01:11:16,910 --> 01:11:19,770
I couldn't shoot because he was in front of me.

832
01:11:20,110 --> 01:11:22,850

There you go.

845
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:00,240

That's right.

851
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:13,320
Never expected me on the other side!

852
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:14,940
Okay, we're...

853
01:13:15,740 --> 01:13:18,300
This is the most tactical I've ever been.

854
01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:21,900
All right, now it's defense.

855
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:24,320
What was the best for defense?

856
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:25,960
It was like...

857
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:27,120
Oh, this one.

858
01:13:27,220 --> 01:13:28,900
I remember I used her because I had Medkit.

859
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:31,020
I can just heal myself.

860
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:34,380
I'm so tactical.

861
01:13:34,540 --> 01:13:35,000
Look at that.

862
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:38,740
Look at that.

863
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,680
These guys are super new, new.

864
01:13:44,860 --> 01:13:45,460
That's me.

865
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:46,580
All right.

866
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:47,680
Don't worry, guys.

867
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:50,380

868
01:13:50,380 --> 01:13:51,160
What was it?

869
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:54,480
Alright, deploy a barricade.

870
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:00,420
And then...

871
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:02,020
They'll never expect this.

872
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:05,300
Or this.

873
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:08,260
That's right.

874
01:14:08,780 --> 01:14:09,240
And then...

875
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:10,900

I'm so goddamn paranoid.

905
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:45,060
I feel like the motion sensor helps with that.

906
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:48,500
Wait, unless someone...

907
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:49,560

Alright, here we go.

913
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:21,350
Is it really paranoid if they're actually out to get you

914
01:18:21,350 --> 01:18:33,290

That's actually a crazy thing to say.

922
01:18:57,570 --> 01:18:58,030
What?

923
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:03,940
I didn't even have a chance.

924
01:19:08,220 --> 01:19:12,640
Oh my god, I looked out at the window one time.

925
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:14,060
How do we get the crawl?

926
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,820
don't even get the privilege to crawl.

927
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:21,940
I just wanted to hammer.

928
01:19:31,180 --> 01:19:32,760
I wanted to hammer.

929
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:37,520
Well, that guy's crazy.

930
01:19:37,620 --> 01:19:40,220
Oh my god, the jiggle peeks though.

931
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:44,880
It's okay, my team can carry me.

932
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:48,160
I believe in my team.

933
01:19:48,820 --> 01:19:49,480
She's planning.

934
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,160
Look at them go.

935
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:55,140
Well, How do I expect the next person?

936
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:56,620
Wait, that is so smart.

937
01:19:57,080 --> 01:19:57,820
Write this down.

938
01:19:58,180 --> 01:19:59,600
Guys, write this down for my tournament.

939
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:02,780
Wait, that is so smart.

940
01:20:03,220 --> 01:20:04,740
Why is this face?

941
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:08,400
The pawn plant is next to the window.

942
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:09,540
Guys, write this down.

943
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,920
I will choose this map so I can plant right here.

944
01:20:12,580 --> 01:20:19,720
I will plant it right here.

945
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:23,120
Guys, write this down so I won't be last place.

946
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:38,980
the coldest not last oh my god my team is smart the enemy
can do yeah but if we do it first it'll be different guys i

947
01:20:38,980 --> 01:20:42,020
don't think hammer boy is good in this map maybe

948
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:57,870
yeah note to sell platinum year windows i have a feeling
that maybe maybe hammer boy might not be for this particular

949
01:20:57,870 --> 01:20:58,490
area.

950
01:20:59,650 --> 01:21:00,990
Oh, that guy's level 8 already.

951
01:21:02,090 --> 01:21:03,590
I might need more than a habit.

952
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:11,320
Alright.

953
01:21:11,620 --> 01:21:13,280
See you guys, but I'm figuring it out.

954
01:21:13,660 --> 01:21:13,980
Slowly but surely.

955
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:16,240
I'm relearning the game for next week.

956
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:18,420
Slowly but surely.

957
01:21:18,700 --> 01:21:20,760
It will work out eventually.

958
01:21:23,900 --> 01:21:26,580
That's the risk I'm willing to take.

959
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:38,520
Alright, I'm going to believe in my team to show me the way
all right reloading cover me i have motion oh wait is that

960
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:42,300
same bad spot no oh my god it is

961

962
01:22:09,170 --> 01:22:12,070

963
01:22:16,850 --> 01:22:18,570
Oh my god, he's right there.

964
01:22:19,910 --> 01:22:21,050
I'm scared, guys.

965
01:22:21,110 --> 01:22:21,590
He just want to hop.

966
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:23,930
He just want to hop spin and plant.

967
01:22:24,150 --> 01:22:25,030
We got you.

968
01:22:27,290 --> 01:22:29,050
He's like, come on, you got this.

969
01:22:30,990 --> 01:22:35,270
I got to be

970
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:44,840
the smartest shit I ever done.

971
01:22:49,030 --> 01:22:50,110
What the fuck he crouched?

972
01:22:50,570 --> 01:22:53,290
He fucking crashed so I couldn't shoot at him!

973
01:22:53,490 --> 01:22:53,630
Ah!

974
01:22:56,510 --> 01:22:57,390

983
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:19,650

The crouch technique.

985
01:23:23,790 --> 01:23:26,030

986
01:23:26,130 --> 01:23:28,150

One minute remaining.

1037
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:42,220

1253
01:42:17,540 --> 01:42:26,120

fucking panicking.

1258
01:42:38,460 --> 01:42:42,500
Like, literally, like, an hour before the stream was going
to start.

1259
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:44,160
I was having a breakdown.

1260
01:42:44,340 --> 01:42:46,840
I was just like, ah, what do I say?

1261
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:48,420
Ah!

1262
01:42:52,730 --> 01:42:54,270
But I'm feeling a lot better now.

1263
01:42:54,310 --> 01:42:54,970
I'm okay now.

1264
01:42:55,110 --> 01:42:55,510
I'm okay.

1265
01:42:55,530 --> 01:43:05,130
everything uh flowed naturally in the end i mean i'm i feel
like i'm very good at like improv or like uh just in the

1266
01:43:05,130 --> 01:43:17,030
moment in the moment i'm really good with like uh how do i
say it like just being able to uh go with the flow in the

1267
01:43:17,030 --> 01:43:24,210
moment but if i'm like but before it happens because i like
go into streamer mode real quick, I click into the streamer

1268
01:43:24,210 --> 01:43:28,630
mode, um, persona.

1269
01:43:29,130 --> 01:43:31,990
I don't say persona, but like perspective, I guess.

1270
01:43:32,790 --> 01:43:40,290
And, and then like, I, my mind just like does everything
like, um, does everything like instantly.

1271
01:43:41,330 --> 01:43:46,230
And, but if I'm not streaming, if I'm not streaming, I'm
just panicking.

1272
01:43:47,770 --> 01:43:53,930
I'm freaking out and panicking because I don't know what to
when i'm not streaming yeah the mindset i just switch into

1273
01:43:53,930 --> 01:44:00,910
the mindset and then like i know how to like salvage
situations or like uh just fix stuff like on the fly type

1274
01:44:00,910 --> 01:44:07,270
deal but when i'm not streaming is i'm just panic i'm just
like in full-on panic mode because i'm like what do i do

i'm just I'm not like, I'm like, I don't know.

1307
01:48:48,160 --> 01:48:52,580
It's always, event streams are always like a lot for me.

1308
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:54,980
And like, I only had a month.

1309
01:48:55,060 --> 01:48:57,020
I will give you guys like a heads up.

1310
01:48:57,340 --> 01:49:00,440
Because obviously, you know, I had like the new year stuff
to do too.

1311
01:49:00,780 --> 01:49:02,920
So you know how I had the new year stuff as well.

1312
01:49:03,820 --> 01:49:06,620
So all my attention was spent on the new year's prep.

1313
01:49:07,180 --> 01:49:13,820
And then so for the anniversary, I only had a month to
actually figure out what exactly I wanted to do.

1314
01:49:15,600 --> 01:49:24,280
then I went straight to like anniversary prepping um and so
I was like super like I I didn't have I didn't know what to

1315
01:49:24,280 --> 01:49:34,000
do at first so I'm glad that I figured it out at the end
after the new year's so I just hope you guys enjoy it I

1316
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:46,560
really do um all right I think that's my waiting room is
complete all right yay anyway you're a member of your

1317
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:53,060
YouTube member we are going to be watching men in black I'm
super excited because I personally love the men in black

1318
01:49:53,060 --> 01:50:00,800
series and I've been looking forward to watching um an
actual good movie for a while now um and I'm glad men in

1319
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:10,820
black is uh the movie of the choice also fun fact I don't
this is uh this is uh unrelated uh out of topic but did you

1320
01:50:10,820 --> 01:50:24,500
guys know Timu now offers food now you can order steak off
of Timu I don't know if it's advisable, but you can now

1321
01:50:24,500 --> 01:50:27,520
order Timu steak, by the way.

1322
01:50:29,320 --> 01:50:45,340
Also, another little fun thing that I wrote down, but did
you guys know that, yeah, what animal is that?

1323
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:57,340
Did you guys see that Morse Critical uploaded a video today
where apparently like the new trend right now with AI is

1324
01:50:57,340 --> 01:51:07,040
that they take big content creator videos and then redub it
in AI in Chinese with their voice.

1325
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:11,860
So there is a, so he was showing a channel that was just
redubbing

1326
01:51:15,620 --> 01:51:28,220
just like him but if he speaks Chinese like it was no I
think I think that was crazy because it literally sounds

1327
01:51:28,220 --> 01:51:36,660
just like him but what if he speaks Mandarin like and like
it's like the speaking style too like the way he talks this

1328
01:51:36,660 --> 01:51:44,760
unique way of speaking and also like just his voice in
general and it's so funny It was like the, the, the Toby

1329
01:51:44,760 --> 01:51:51,520
Fox, like, um, Toby Fox, uh, you know how he's like, what
was it called?

1330
01:51:52,720 --> 01:51:54,180
Like Toho Project.

1331
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:59,280
You know how Toby Fox is like, when he speaks English, he
was doing, like, he was doing an interview in Japanese.

1332
01:51:59,680 --> 01:52:03,700
And he was like Toho Project, and, and in, and in Japanese.

1333
01:52:04,200 --> 01:52:14,640
And there was that moment with the AI dub, and he was like,
Markiplier, I don't know you want to do what's so funny.

1334
01:52:15,040 --> 01:52:18,180
I was just like, it's like, I don't know what you want to
do.

1335
01:52:19,420 --> 01:52:19,940
Markiplier.

1336
01:52:25,630 --> 01:52:27,430
It's like, what the fuck?

1337
01:52:27,730 --> 01:52:30,890
And then the channel had other YouTubers too.

1338
01:52:31,210 --> 01:52:34,290
And I was like, oh my, it's just so funny.

1339
01:52:34,370 --> 01:52:36,670
I actually like, I know like, you know, it's AI.

1340
01:52:36,910 --> 01:52:48,270
But like, I sort of want to know what it sounds like if, If
it was like Koso or XQC dubbed in Chinese, I really want to

1341
01:52:48,270 --> 01:52:48,690
know.

1342
01:52:49,010 --> 01:52:52,530
I want to know what does Chinese XQC sound like?

1343
01:52:52,890 --> 01:52:53,690
I'm sorry.

1344
01:52:54,010 --> 01:52:55,730
I just, I'm so curious.

1345
01:52:56,450 --> 01:52:59,230
Yeah, Chinese XQC, imagine.

1346
01:52:59,870 --> 01:53:00,850
Man, this was the video.

1347
01:53:01,650 --> 01:53:07,250

long time, but it popped up in my recommended.

was like what does that mean

1349
01:53:29,820 --> 01:53:36,600

crazy i guess

I'm just checking out the, what the, what is on here.

1359
01:54:32,980 --> 01:54:34,860
What is that zoo game?

1360
01:54:35,260 --> 01:54:39,660
I know every, I know like, I wasn't thinking of playing as a
main game.

1361
01:54:40,020 --> 01:54:40,420
I don't know.

1362
01:54:43,220 --> 01:54:45,640
Wait, when does I have to do it?

1363
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:46,600
Okay, Resident Evil.

1364
01:54:46,720 --> 01:54:47,280
I don't do it.

1365
01:54:47,300 --> 01:54:53,060
stream for that like I know I said I wasn't gonna play
Resident Evil Requiem but then someone offered me money and

1366
01:54:53,060 --> 01:55:05,400
then I was like okay I originally I wasn't going to and then
they're like what if you do it for X amount of money and I

1367
01:55:05,400 --> 01:55:18,960
was like all right money is nice let's see uh The power of
money.

1368
01:55:19,160 --> 01:55:19,980
It truly is.

1369
01:55:21,480 --> 01:55:23,420
Truly is the power of money.

1370
01:55:24,760 --> 01:55:25,900
Wait, what is this?

1371
01:55:30,630 --> 01:55:32,330
$20 is $20.

1372
01:55:34,130 --> 01:55:36,050
Oh, you guys want me to do My Voice Zoo?

1373
01:55:36,430 --> 01:55:37,330
I mean, I could try it out.

1374
01:55:37,670 --> 01:55:42,430
I was about, I felt like this was like, I mean, it could be
a one-off, but it felt like such a short one-off because

1375
01:55:42,430 --> 01:55:43,790
it's just like an idle game.

1376
01:55:43,870 --> 01:55:49,510
For those who don't know, My Voice Zoo, it's an idle game
where you voice act several.

1377
01:55:49,530 --> 01:55:57,810
zoo animals uh with your own voice and like it for me it
didn't feel like a mainstream game like a main channel game

1378
01:55:57,810 --> 01:56:04,110
because it's like it's like it seems like something you it's
like it seems like a quick throwaway game i don't know how

1379
01:56:04,110 --> 01:56:14,910
much content i can get out of that all right let's try it
out my voice zoo yeah quick one and done it's very short and

1380
01:56:14,910 --> 01:56:17,430
shitty all right let's open our own zoo

1381
01:56:27,360 --> 01:56:27,840
Uh...

1382
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:28,560
What's it called?

1383
01:56:29,460 --> 01:56:29,940
My...

1384
01:56:31,100 --> 01:56:31,580

01:56:31,580 --> 01:56:32,140
Zoo.

1386
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:35,300
Wow!

1387
01:56:35,580 --> 01:56:38,280
Is this the zoo I'll get to take care of starting today?

1388
01:56:39,080 --> 01:56:40,800
I'll have to make the animal sounds myself?

1389
01:56:41,320 --> 01:56:42,640
That's a little weird.

1390
01:56:43,660 --> 01:56:45,520
Hmm, but it does sound kind of fun.

1391
01:56:46,240 --> 01:56:49,100
Literally, I bought this game in like one minute and
download...

1392
01:56:49,100 --> 01:56:51,300
I bought and downloaded this game in one minute.

1393
01:56:54,300 --> 01:56:55,420
Alright, here we go.

1394
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:57,360
Oh, I got a duck!

1395
01:56:59,320 --> 01:56:59,880
Alright.

1396
01:57:00,840 --> 01:57:02,840

Oh, I got a sheep.

1406
01:57:38,580 --> 01:57:39,140

America's Next Top Model.

1584
02:09:40,930 --> 02:09:42,710

That's a lion, right?

1643
02:13:17,780 --> 02:13:19,560
Okay, wait, I have a good one.

1644
02:13:21,600 --> 02:13:22,620
Lion Goon.

1645
02:13:23,160 --> 02:13:24,130
Wait, okay, it's...

1646
02:13:27,490 --> 02:13:29,110
Oh my god, how did it go?

1647
02:13:32,090 --> 02:13:33,650
I've always wanted a brother.

1648
02:13:41,490 --> 02:13:44,450
I've always wanted a brother.

1649
02:13:48,490 --> 02:13:49,770
All right.

1650
02:13:49,990 --> 02:13:51,070
I was rooting for you.

1651
02:13:51,310 --> 02:13:52,930
We were all rooting for you.

1652
02:13:53,010 --> 02:13:53,270
All right.

1653
02:13:54,270 --> 02:13:56,470
I've always wanted a brother.

1654
02:13:59,150 --> 02:14:08,490
Where you can harmonize with these Where you can do you can
harmonize with all your animals I think I think my favorite

1655
02:14:08,490 --> 02:14:19,350
is These two the classics, you know, we do you know first
try is perfection You could never outdo your first try and

1656
02:14:19,350 --> 02:14:31,410
in this guy We're the ladies or walrus We're the ladies or
And then...

1657
02:14:33,690 --> 02:14:34,770
Alright, what else?

1658
02:14:34,850 --> 02:14:35,870
Who else do we have left?

1659
02:14:35,930 --> 02:14:38,770
See, this is so... I feel like we're almost done unlocking
everything.

1660
02:14:40,010 --> 02:14:40,670
Oh, Rhino.

1661
02:14:41,410 --> 02:14:41,870
Fuck.

1662
02:14:42,410 --> 02:14:44,610
I don't know why Rhino sound like.

1663
02:14:45,610 --> 02:14:46,810
Rhine Goon.

1664
02:14:47,110 --> 02:14:49,050
What the fuck do Rhino sound like?

1665
02:14:55,200 --> 02:14:56,460
I don't know.

1666
02:14:58,900 --> 02:15:00,420
Rhino, that's hard.

1667
02:15:01,780 --> 02:15:02,180
Okay.

1668
02:15:02,640 --> 02:15:05,900
Rhino, Rhino sounds.

1669
02:15:06,440 --> 02:15:08,500
What do rhinos even sound like in general?

1670
02:15:09,620 --> 02:15:10,300
I never heard her.

1671
02:15:11,020 --> 02:15:11,760
What the fuck?

1672
02:15:15,200 --> 02:15:15,880
Um...

1673
02:15:15,880 --> 02:15:19,140
Oh, wait, I know.

1674
02:15:19,480 --> 02:15:20,920
I know, I know now.

1675
02:15:22,620 --> 02:15:23,240
Oh, me.

1676
02:15:24,120 --> 02:15:25,020
Oh, me.

1677
02:15:26,400 --> 02:15:27,380
Oh, me.

1678
02:15:28,280 --> 02:15:28,740
Oh.

1679
02:15:32,910 --> 02:15:33,890
There you go.

1680
02:15:34,870 --> 02:15:36,030
It sounds like Mars.

1681
02:15:36,110 --> 02:15:37,430
That's what they sound like.

1682
02:15:37,610 --> 02:15:40,930
I literally looked up Rhino's sound effects.

1683
02:15:41,070 --> 02:15:42,390
That's what they sound like.

1684
02:15:44,330 --> 02:15:46,530
I am your character arc.

1685
02:15:48,950 --> 02:15:49,610
Don't believe me.

1686
02:15:49,670 --> 02:15:51,670
Look up Rhino sounds right now.

1687
02:15:52,210 --> 02:15:54,050
That's literally what they sound like.

1688
02:15:54,710 --> 02:15:54,830
Oh, wait.

1689
02:15:54,930 --> 02:15:55,490
That's an elephant.

1690
02:15:57,070 --> 02:15:57,230
Wait.

1691
02:15:59,110 --> 02:15:59,670
Wait.

1692
02:15:59,670 --> 02:16:00,890
Wait, no, I can't do elephant.

1693
02:16:07,330 --> 02:16:12,070
That's not right, is that a...

1694
02:16:12,070 --> 02:16:13,130
There you go.

1695
02:16:16,060 --> 02:16:17,620
Alright, that's a natural real sound.

1696
02:16:19,520 --> 02:16:19,960
Look at that!

1697
02:16:20,260 --> 02:16:22,020
I made a real animal sound!

1698
02:16:22,260 --> 02:16:22,860
See guys?

1699
02:16:24,020 --> 02:16:24,800
I care.

1700
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:28,720
And then use like a little trumpet.

1701
02:16:32,460 --> 02:16:33,420
Oh me!

1702
02:16:34,740 --> 02:16:36,060
I'm ready for you!

1703
02:16:39,220 --> 02:16:41,840
Holy fuck, I'm so stupid.

1704
02:16:42,160 --> 02:16:43,200
Oh, we gotta wait.

1705
02:16:44,960 --> 02:16:46,800
We gotta wait, but we can hang out with the bird.

1706
02:16:55,580 --> 02:16:58,300
Say, can you see?

1707
02:17:01,680 --> 02:17:03,900
Say, can you see?

1708
02:17:06,340 --> 02:17:06,980
America!

1709
02:17:14,520 --> 02:17:17,580
Oh my god, it's gonna take forever, guys.

1710
02:17:18,360 --> 02:17:18,880
Yep, loud.

1711
02:17:19,280 --> 02:17:19,980
Yep, more.

1712
02:17:22,040 --> 02:17:23,160
I'm a bear.

1713
02:17:24,040 --> 02:17:24,940
That's just not real.

1714
02:17:25,740 --> 02:17:26,220
Yeah.

1715
02:17:28,760 --> 02:17:30,120
All right, God, I can't afford it.

1716
02:17:30,700 --> 02:17:32,140
I can afford a hippo now.

1717
02:17:33,880 --> 02:17:34,720
Oh, what to do?

1718
02:17:35,820 --> 02:17:36,840
Oh, wait, I got an idea.

1719
02:17:38,800 --> 02:17:39,280
Uh.

1720
02:17:41,680 --> 02:17:42,260
Wait, I have an idea.

1721
02:17:42,320 --> 02:17:43,680
I know what to do.

1722
02:17:53,760 --> 02:17:54,240
Wait, wait,

1723
02:17:57,570 --> 02:17:58,630
wait, wait, I got it.

1724
02:17:59,510 --> 02:18:04,950
I like them big.

1725
02:18:05,390 --> 02:18:06,570
I like them chunky.

1726
02:18:08,090 --> 02:18:09,110
I like them big.

1727
02:18:09,890 --> 02:18:10,750
I like them chunky.

1728
02:18:12,750 --> 02:18:13,810
There you go.

1729
02:18:13,950 --> 02:18:14,450
There you go.

1730
02:18:15,850 --> 02:18:16,350
Moto, Gune.

1731
02:18:17,550 --> 02:18:19,470
Moto, Moto likes you.

1732
02:18:26,510 --> 02:18:28,410
We can't buy another one.

1733
02:18:29,030 --> 02:18:29,530
Oh, I can't.

1734
02:18:29,530 --> 02:18:34,090
I was gonna say I want another one to be like, Mutto Mutto
likes you.

1735
02:18:34,290 --> 02:18:35,250
There we go.

1736
02:18:36,050 --> 02:18:36,930
A funky course.

1737
02:18:37,230 --> 02:18:38,870
What else would the hippo be?

1738
02:18:43,750 --> 02:18:44,130
Come on.

1739
02:18:44,230 --> 02:18:45,290
I like them big.

1740
02:18:45,990 --> 02:18:47,070
I like them chunky.

1741
02:18:47,550 --> 02:18:48,510
I like them chunk.

1742
02:18:50,370 --> 02:18:51,470
Just record.

1743
02:18:51,810 --> 02:18:54,590
Again, I only have three seconds.

1744
02:18:55,350 --> 02:18:56,890
That's all I can fit in.

1745
02:18:58,230 --> 02:19:06,850
If I could, if I could buy multiple hippos, I will record
the entire Motomoto song around this pond.

1746
02:19:08,950 --> 02:19:12,090
I'll record the entire clip just here.

1747
02:19:19,070 --> 02:19:19,570
All right, can we afford?

1748
02:19:19,650 --> 02:19:20,430
Oh, we can't afford it.

1749
02:19:20,610 --> 02:19:20,970
What is this?

1750
02:19:21,250 --> 02:19:22,950
Oh, that's just a regular bear.

1751
02:19:27,150 --> 02:19:27,870
Bear goon.

1752
02:19:28,950 --> 02:19:29,710
I don't know.

1753
02:19:29,710 --> 02:19:32,550
What would a- I mean, I already have a polar bear.

1754
02:19:34,490 --> 02:19:36,710
What other references can I do?

1755
02:19:37,810 --> 02:19:39,230
He's the bear.

1756
02:19:44,320 --> 02:19:44,900
Oh, wait.

1757
02:19:47,180 --> 02:19:49,920

a lot of like hannah barbara shows are like sort of like

1779
02:21:35,180 --> 02:21:41,500
they're like super retro now and there's no like actual
where you boost up No one wants to really do a reboot of

1780
02:21:41,500 --> 02:21:48,340
them because I feel like Those types of cartoons are like
Not what kids like to watch these days

1781
02:21:58,310 --> 02:22:00,630
Ah yes, the king of the jungle

1782
02:22:03,870 --> 02:22:12,930
Yeah, but Scooby-Doo works But like I feel like Yogi Bear
and also Rocky and Bo Winkle Is like shows that don't really

1783
02:22:12,930 --> 02:22:22,830
work in today's generations People don't watch like Tom and
Jerry is very popular in Asia, but in NA it's like not like

1784
02:22:22,830 --> 02:22:25,050
people don't really watch Tom and Jerry shows anymore

1785
02:22:30,450 --> 02:22:36,770
Tom and Jerry shows in Asia are so cute though Is that
another that's a gorilla?

1786

gorilla.

1788
02:22:45,910 --> 02:22:48,950
I just gotta wait we're almost there

1789
02:22:54,870 --> 02:23:03,350
I don't think Looney Tunes I think their best Looney Tunes
adaptation was the one where they had what's her name?

1790
02:23:07,230 --> 02:23:14,550
Kristen Wig as Lola Bunny I know people were really upset
that Lola Bunny wasn't hot anymore but the show was so funny

1791
02:23:14,550 --> 02:23:21,830
like you know like Kristen Wig did was like Lola was Lola
and she was like this crazy soccer girlfriend, but the show

1792
02:23:21,830 --> 02:23:23,890
was really fucking funny and then it got cancelled.

1793
02:23:24,190 --> 02:23:26,390
I don't like the newer Looney Tunes shows.

1794
02:23:28,130 --> 02:23:29,290
The newer one was not as good.

1795
02:23:29,610 --> 02:23:32,830
I know they canceled the Tiny Tunes too, like the reboot.

1796
02:23:34,570 --> 02:23:34,830
All right.

1797
02:23:38,480 --> 02:23:38,980
Okay.

1798
02:23:43,430 --> 02:23:44,530

1808
02:24:17,680 --> 02:24:18,320

Guys, I have one.

1815
02:24:31,580 --> 02:24:34,060
Only one to Harambe is so hard to pick.

Wait, don't you?

1819
02:24:46,540 --> 02:24:47,600

Never falls.

1822
02:24:57,200 --> 02:24:58,080
Wait, wait.

1823
02:24:59,040 --> 02:25:00,900

Wife gone.

1836
02:25:49,520 --> 02:25:50,260
Regret.

1837
02:25:50,600 --> 02:25:52,400

1838
02:25:52,640 --> 02:25:53,440
Is that the one?

1839

Think about wife.

I've never had a cat with a dog before.

1949
02:35:30,960 --> 02:35:34,960
I'm actually curious if dad would like to hang out with a
cat.

1950
02:35:38,160 --> 02:35:40,400
Doggo, why did you interrupt her son?

1951
02:35:41,640 --> 02:35:44,000
This is why she never finished her son.

1952
02:35:46,040 --> 02:35:48,320
They have to grow up to get it all.

1953
02:35:49,340 --> 02:35:49,820
Unlucky.

1954
02:35:50,340 --> 02:35:52,580

1966
02:36:46,280 --> 02:36:47,200
We were all brooding!

1967
02:36:52,290 --> 02:36:54,810
All right, now we can finally buy the rabbit.

1968
02:36:56,310 --> 02:36:57,070
Oh, man.

1969
02:36:57,230 --> 02:36:57,950
I don't know.

1970
02:36:58,770 --> 02:37:00,390
I don't know the rabbit, Bunny.

1971
02:37:00,670 --> 02:37:02,870
Why is she with the...

1972
02:37:02,870 --> 02:37:04,530
Why is she with the caribou?

1973
02:37:06,290 --> 02:37:06,930
Oh, wait.

1974
02:37:07,950 --> 02:37:09,190

1980
02:37:22,560 --> 02:37:23,400

1981
02:37:24,800 --> 02:37:25,860

1982
02:37:26,400 --> 02:37:27,180

1983
02:37:27,180 --> 02:37:28,340
What's up, Doc?

1984
02:37:29,100 --> 02:37:30,600
Where are the ladies?

1985
02:37:31,640 --> 02:37:32,880
Where are the ladies?

1986
02:37:34,060 --> 02:37:34,980

1987
02:37:38,560 --> 02:37:39,480
Oh, wait, you're right.

1988
02:37:39,980 --> 02:37:40,500

02:37:40,500 --> 02:37:42,200
Oh, I can't change the name.

1990
02:37:42,720 --> 02:37:45,340

02:37:45,340 --> 02:37:47,280
She wanted to be here, guys.

1992
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:51,620
Technically, she wanted to be near the...

1993
02:37:51,620 --> 02:37:53,340
It was automatic!

02:39:45,070 --> 02:39:45,830
Dirtle.

2021
02:39:46,090 --> 02:39:46,970
It's like squirtle.

2022
02:39:47,330 --> 02:39:48,610
But it's turtle.

2023
02:39:50,290 --> 02:39:50,410
Dirtle.

2024
02:39:50,830 --> 02:39:54,690
All right.

2025
02:39:54,870 --> 02:39:55,770

2026
02:39:56,070 --> 02:39:56,250
Dirtle.

02:40:08,480 --> 02:40:10,000
Turtle Goon use water gun.

02:40:52,470 --> 02:40:57,980
Do you really think he fits with them?

2039
02:41:11,760 --> 02:41:14,220

2050
02:42:18,220 --> 02:42:24,400
For those who don't understand that reference, James Baxter
is the most talented animator in the world.

2051
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:28,600
He's like a crazy good animator, and he animates a lot of
stuff by himself.

2052
02:42:28,620 --> 02:42:37,600
himself and Adventure Dime did like a little episode
dedicated to him where he animated himself as a horse uh on

Cow goon.

2060
02:43:53,680 --> 02:43:55,500
Why does the male cow have udders?

2061
02:43:57,220 --> 02:43:59,080
Why does the male cow have udders?

2062
02:44:04,670 --> 02:44:06,510
Why does the male cow have udders?

2063
02:44:11,990 --> 02:44:22,130
Have you guys ever watched Have you ever watched Barney?

2064
02:44:22,150 --> 02:44:26,670
Guys, why do all the male cows in Barnyard have other?

2065
02:44:27,150 --> 02:44:29,870
There are no male cows.

2066
02:44:33,610 --> 02:44:35,390
If you ever watched the movie Barnyard.

2067
02:44:37,330 --> 02:44:45,890
If you ever watched Barnyard, for some reason, the main
character who was supposed to be a male cow.

2068
02:44:46,930 --> 02:44:48,570
He has others.

2069
02:44:48,870 --> 02:44:49,770
The male cow have others.

02:44:59,470 --> 02:45:01,750
Why does the male cow have udders?

All right, chick mugs.

2076
02:45:07,370 --> 02:45:08,610
Oh my God.

2077
02:45:12,890 --> 02:45:14,570
Oh my God.

2078
02:45:17,390 --> 02:45:18,390
My beautiful zoo.

02:45:18,430 --> 02:45:20,290
I'm going to start moving them here.

2080
02:45:20,890 --> 02:45:23,050
I'm going to start moving them into my campsite.

2081
02:45:24,090 --> 02:45:24,330
Why?

2082
02:45:28,440 --> 02:45:32,260
We're moving them all close while we wait.

2083
02:45:34,580 --> 02:45:36,440
We'll put them all here.

2084
02:45:41,370 --> 02:45:42,530
Alright, here you go.

2085
02:45:45,890 --> 02:45:48,090
This is a beautiful orchestra.

2086
02:45:56,320 --> 02:45:58,580
It's time to get over simulated, guys.

02:46:06,980 --> 02:46:09,000

2089
02:46:10,220 --> 02:46:12,560
Is there anything over here?

2090
02:46:12,900 --> 02:46:13,080
No.

2091
02:46:14,020 --> 02:46:16,220

There's a stale!

2120
02:49:30,630 --> 02:49:33,070

2121
02:49:35,930 --> 02:49:36,690
Alright, nice!

2122
02:49:36,910 --> 02:49:37,330
We did it!

2123
02:49:37,330 --> 02:49:39,450
We completed the game, guys!

2124
02:49:40,170 --> 02:49:41,650
Can you guys hear me?

2125
02:49:42,390 --> 02:49:44,130
Guys, can you hear me?

2126
02:49:59,180 --> 02:50:01,900
Which one is the streamer?

2127
02:50:02,260 --> 02:50:03,360
Who is who?

2128
02:50:15,220 --> 02:50:16,640
And was that one?

2129
02:50:16,660 --> 02:50:17,580
We finished...

2130
02:50:17,580 --> 02:50:18,320
Oh, wait, we got...

2131
02:50:18,320 --> 02:50:19,860
We unlocked the Windy Hill.

2132
02:50:22,260 --> 02:50:25,200
Do we get more animals when we go up?

2133
02:50:27,100 --> 02:50:28,300
Oh, no, we don't.

2134
02:50:28,620 --> 02:50:28,960
Oh, my God.

2135
02:50:29,060 --> 02:50:30,100
We beat the game, guys.

2136
02:50:30,200 --> 02:50:30,440
See?

2137
02:50:30,560 --> 02:50:31,100
I told you.

2138
02:50:31,100 --> 02:50:33,300
I was like, there's no way I can make this a mainstream.

2139
02:50:39,410 --> 02:50:40,130
Sweet silence.

2140
02:50:42,410 --> 02:50:43,570
Look at how we did it, guys.

2141
02:50:43,770 --> 02:50:44,070
Oh, my God.

2142
02:50:44,210 --> 02:50:45,270
I could buy a...

2143
02:50:46,250 --> 02:50:47,290
I could be a duck.

2144
02:51:24,400 --> 02:51:30,900
I was like,

2145
02:51:41,200 --> 02:51:42,260
I think this is my favorite.

2146
02:52:22,360 --> 02:52:24,040
In harmony?

2147
02:52:24,620 --> 02:52:26,580
I don't think you can harmonize that.

2148
02:52:27,860 --> 02:52:28,340
Nice.

2149
02:52:29,340 --> 02:52:29,620
Oh,

2150
02:52:37,520 --> 02:52:38,500
it's for this.

2151
02:52:39,380 --> 02:52:40,220
Santa's not real.

2152
02:52:41,940 --> 02:52:42,380
Okay.

2153
02:52:47,160 --> 02:52:48,300
Alright, I gotta go now.

2154
02:52:48,500 --> 02:52:49,140
I gotta go.

2155
02:52:49,300 --> 02:52:52,720
I had a really fun time with this one.

2156
02:52:52,880 --> 02:52:55,600
I told, I said, there was a reason why I never played this.

2157
02:52:55,600 --> 02:52:58,860
I wanted to check this out, but I was like, there's no way I
can do it on the main channel.

2158
02:52:59,040 --> 02:53:00,060
This game is so short.

2159
02:53:01,280 --> 02:53:05,220
I literally finished this game in like 30 minutes.

2160
02:53:06,220 --> 02:53:07,600
Santa's not real.

2161
02:53:10,620 --> 02:53:11,500
Alright, guys.

2162
02:53:12,560 --> 02:53:14,260
I have a member stream tonight.

2163
02:53:14,380 --> 02:53:16,480
If you are a member, we're going to be watching Men in
Black.

2164
02:53:16,600 --> 02:53:25,200
Thank you all for coming to the announcement and also, uh,
and also coming to staying here for the Twitch stream, the

2165
02:53:25,200 --> 02:53:26,220
little after party.

2166
02:53:26,840 --> 02:53:28,660
Um, I'm going to go prep.

2167
02:53:28,760 --> 02:53:32,160
I'm going to grab some food and then prep for the watchers
on stream.

2168
02:53:32,640 --> 02:53:35,720
Uh, it might be like five to ten minutes late only because
I'm going to grab food.

2169
02:53:36,120 --> 02:53:38,840
But as always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture check.

2170
