14
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:18,260

hour it was like i think so i think it's like an hour long

15
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:28,340
it's like an um hb like canadian hbo we have canadian hbo
called crave um and it's it's pretty gay i would say it's

16
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:43,660
it's it's pretty gay it's very gay because i was just like
whoa oh my god Yeah, people were telling me about it.

17
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,220
It's like based off of some real people or something.

18
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,380
It was like, it was based off a book.

19
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,820
So apparently, like, like there's a lot of closeted hockey
players.

20
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:53,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,620
Because it's such a maddenly sport.

22
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,760
So like, a lot of them don't really want to come out.

23
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,800
Apparently, like, after the, after the show came out, a lot
of like, I think like one or two hockey players actually

24
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,520
came out of the closet because they were inspired by heated
rivalry and stuff.

25
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:19,340
you know like the amount of like a lot of people were
talking about it and so i was like oh it must be like you

26
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:26,360
know like the sex scenes i was like oh it must be like you
know pretty like not not like super intense no i've heard

27
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:36,400
i've heard that it's all raunchy and yeah it's yeah i was
like oh my fan fiction heart she's going back to pujo

28
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:44,720
everybody i was just like oh my god normally but it's on
camera.

29
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:45,780
It's...

30
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:53,680
The only thing I know, well, besides like that, it's super
sexy is like, I've seen like families watch it.

31
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:58,960
Like, yeah, because like I was thinking, oh yeah, wait, Game
of Thrones is sort of like Game of Thrones where like

32
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,340
everybody's watching it.

33
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,000
But then there's like some very intense scenes in Game of
Thrones.

34
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:11,420
It's basically like, like, okay, my favorite part, though,
is like, there's like, it's like every time they like swap

35
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:11,900
positions.

36
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:19,140
they do a fade to black like it's a you know like those like
point games on newgrounds and yeah you're very familiar with

37
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:27,960
that right like like i hear that'll explain it to you in a
way that you'll understand so every time they like change

38
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:33,440
positions they do a fade to black and there'll be a new
position i was like and then somebody was like wait this is

39
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,520
like there's like one two three four

40
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:48,980
It's looking crazy, I was just like, and then it's always
like three months later, and then like two weeks later,

41
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,920
there's so many like jump cuts to like be like, two years
later.

42
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,140
What the hell?

43
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,240
Oh my god.

44
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:02,060
Yeah, it got to load the new animation.

45
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:12,320
Oh, and then they're apparently, apparently it's so
influential that I just saw on Twitter that they, selected

46
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:19,540
to be the torchbearers for the winter Olympics yeah oh my
god yeah they're gonna be the torchbearer like there

47
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:26,340
obviously there's like lots of torchbearers but like the
actors also the Russian guy isn't even Russian he's fucking

48
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:38,620
Canadian yeah yeah I was like bro this Madden ain't even
Russian he's Canadian okay but it was actually it was a

49
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:48,500
really good Russian accent though it one thing i've heard
about the show is that because the guys like the actors are

50
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:54,800
so like they're they're blowing up like they're really
charming and like people like the actors themselves too yeah

51
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:01,820
but like other like i've heard that like other hollywood
actors are like upset about it because they're like we had

52
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:08,880
to like fight through hollywood and these guys come in and
they're on their random crave tv show and they get to people

53
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,400
it's a very respectable canadian hbo

54
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:21,120
it's all we have because hbo doesn't exist in canada so the
crave is all we have like yeah apparently they're like

55
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:28,520
really jealous right it's so rude like one of the one of the
guys was like was like a server at a restaurant like yeah

56
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:38,420
yeah yeah it's crazy also they're cheeked up they're very
cheeked up they have like it's crazy because i was like man

57
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:45,220
man these guys They have like really, they're like, their
chest is like, like mini boobs, I would say.

58
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,200
They're very puffy.

59
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,180
And then they have very...

60
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,260
Like a Pillsbury man.

61
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

62
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,760
You're like, damn.

63
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,500
And also their asses too.

64
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,700
I was like, damn, that's a bubble butt right there.

65
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:08,000
I mean, I wonder if they had to be like, you know, your
cheeks are going to be on screen a lot.

66
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,180
No, that's why.

67
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,020
We gotta enhance it.

68
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:16,180
We gotta do, like, special regiments for it.

69
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,620
That's why Snake's butt is big, because Kojima was like,
well, you're gonna be staring at it a lot.

70
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,280
Yeah, dude, did he scan that guy's butt when they did that?

71
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,820
Like, you know how, like, they scanned the lady's toes?

72
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,640
Well, I don't think they scanned anybody for him back in the
day.

73
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,980
Oh, they said they had to...

74
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,000
Oh, they had to hand-model it.

75
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,480
Yeah, they hand-model that.

76
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,620
Oh, so there's more love put...

77
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,400
There's more love put into it.

78
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:48,540
he was like more pixels more pixels it's not my vision in a
sense like 20 references like i need the butt to be like

79
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:56,860
this to the eye like little notes like red notes like like
notes for it too like he just he just sends a picture of his

80
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:08,680
hands like pretending to grip a butt and like to that size
to that more party yeah hand hand sculpted with care and

81
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:21,600
love like a sponge bob crabby patty like i know this is
really random i was just thinking about it oh so um so

82
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,700
there's this i just thought about it because we're talking
about games but apparently do you know like You didn't do

83
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:33,260
you hear about the there's a game coming on called marathon
and people were downloading the early access of it And when

84
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:44,120
they download early access of it destiny 2 gets installed on
your PC So they they they installed the early access game

85
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:53,080
and then and then they also installed destiny 2 It just
randomly shows up on your PC.

86
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,060
It's crazy is that like a malware?

87
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,080
Yeah He's like, don't know.

88
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,100
I got Destiny 2 a monkey.

89
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,600
You will play Destiny 2.

90
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,740
I feel like that's actually like what malware is.

91
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,000
The Destiny 2 malware.

92
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,640
Wait, that's true.

93
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,620
They actually...

94
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,600
That's crazy.

95
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,180
They created their own malware.

96
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,540
Oh, yeah.

97
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,520
It's like the YouTube album.

98
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,820
Oh, I remembered that.

99
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:33,540
the youtube album remember that when apple first came out
with like the apple music and then youtube albums were like

100
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:40,540
installed onto your phone and you can never delete it what
no i don't remember that it was like when the first iphone i

101
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:46,220
think it was when the first iphone came out and then itunes
was a thing like when itunes first came out and then they're

102
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:54,340
like um and then whenever you sync your phone to itunes like
you have a youtube album a youtube album yeah youtube album

103
00:11:54,340 --> 00:12:03,520
and to and then they were like you can't delete it oh wait i
think i do remember hearing about that yeah yeah yeah and

104
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:14,780
then like like legally you cannot get rid of the album too
so you have to like crack the iphone to delete oh my god the

105
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:22,780
iphone too yeah and then like people were complaining they
pay to like be stuck on the phone

106
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:26,520
It's crazy.

107
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,480
Someone's like, it's still in my library.

108
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,840
I still own the copy of the album.

109
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,260
Anyway, today we're playing Metal Gear Solid Dugdub.

110
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:42,800
It could be the final part because Mint said the rate we're
going that we might be able to finish it today.

111
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:47,300
I feel like if you play as much as you did last time, you
can beat it today.

112
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,580
Oh yeah, I forgot.

113
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,000

My camels goes crazy.

115
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,880
I also forgot all the controls, by the way.

00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,820
It's been a while.

117
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,740

00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,020
Okay.

120
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,100
Who's that over?

121
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:02,900
Oh, that's a bird.

147
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,160
Sending reinforcements.

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:13,660
It's okay.

149
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,060
It's okay.

00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,560
I have an idea.

151
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,240

Okay.

Those birds.

Oh, there we go.

316
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,920
You have to switch the view, yeah.

317
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,700
Oh my god, controller aim is so fucking close.

318
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,420

Yeah, controller aim ain't it.

I'm pretty sure there's a scorpion over here.

322
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:23,580
It's okay.

323
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:24,800

Look at him.

330
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,380
Oh, he doesn't care about it, you guys.

00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,260
Yeah, I'm hungry.

334
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:46,780
All right, now.

335
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,500
Oh, wait, I should eat the vulture.

336
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,440
And they've had, technically, it's cannibalism.

337
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,760
Legally distinct cannibalism.

338
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,500
Legally distinct cannibalism.

339
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,660
Yeah, the best type of cannibalism.

340
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,220
Hey, that's good.

341
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:00,980
Because it's like...

342
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:01,880
Hey, that's good.

343
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,100
More...

344
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,780
It's like, okay, so it's like, you know, you don't...

345
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,080
You know how pigs can eat anything?

346
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:08,380
Yeah.

347
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,860
So, like, how would you know your pig didn't eat a person?

348
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,020
You know?

349
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:13,700
You would never...

350
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:22,440
know you would never know exactly they're here to eat you
know how like like some murderers they like dispose the body

351
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:29,200
parts by like feeding it to pigs because they'll literally
eat anything so like really what if what if your pig was

352
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:40,720
owned by a murderer oh hey it's a crowba cobra a crowba yeah
yeah it could be the mafia pig farms exactly how would you

353
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,660
know if your pig isn't owned by Posing bodies.

354
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,820
He's really tearing into that guy.

355
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:51,140
So technically, we could all be legally distinct cannibals.

356
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,400
We don't know.

357
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,140
You could have eaten...

358
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:57,540
Like if I eat like a pork or then... Yeah.

359
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,920
Maybe it was... He ate a human.

360
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:00,480
Exactly.

361
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,160
He might have eaten a human finger.

362
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,000
You don't know that.

363
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:04,460
Finger!

364
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:05,620
Yeah.

365
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,900
Anti-aircraft.

366
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,200
We're already aircrafts.

367
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:09,960
Yeah.

368
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,920

Mouse and keyboard time.

There we go.

No.

They said they lost sight of me.

Just being a little crocodile.

Just a little crocodile.

438
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,080
Trying to find his way in this big world.

439
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,820
You're going the wrong way.

440
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,440
Just a little crocodile trying to find his way.

441
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,900
Yeah, I'm here to guide you through the world.

442
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:49,180
Just trying to find my place in this big scary world.

443
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:49,880

here oh no i'm fine all right yeah i feel so so safe right

445
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:09,440
now there's a hole there too if you want to like crawl
through it oh what's there oh it really just leads you to

446
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:18,540
the other side but if you i like all right you know what
this will be a stealth run starting now starting starting

447
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:29,800
now okay wait all stuff started why is snakes so oily it's
so like when the enemy team grabs a hold of them he can slip

448
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:42,400
right through oh I see it's like a strat did you see the guy
to the your left oh and you're right oh okay wait there's a

449
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:50,960
guy to my left oh there is it maybe I saw the guy to the
right because the camera angles are your camera Our work is

450
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,080
just very erratic.

451
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:53,320
Okay.

452
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,860
You think I can shoot him from here?

453
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,740
Yeah, I think so.

454
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:06,180
Now just hit the back, the peak of his head right here.

455
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,740
Oh, well, he's wearing a helmet.

456
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,620
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

457
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,280
I have an idea.

458
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:17,460
If I use the sleep dart and I angle it all the way up here,
and then, oh, oh, oh, you waited it out.

459
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:18,400
Yay!

460
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,080
Oh, see, there was another guy.

I knew it.

462
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,340
I knew it.

463
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:24,960
How did that?

464
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,300
Because of the explosion.

465
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:29,320
Oh.

466
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:32,960
How did they?

467
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,340
How did they know?

468
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:44,480
I think you could go.

469
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,780
I don't think I'm sick.

470
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:46,960
This area is like pretty.

471
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:47,600
I'm not gonna lie.

472
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,680
This area is ass.

00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:55,700
Oh shit!

476
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,280
There we go.

00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:00,960
I'll just...

478
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,340
Get in the hole.

479
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,040
Get in the hole.

480
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,200
My little safety hole.

481
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,480
My little safety hole.

482
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:11,080
Okay, we're gonna do a stealth round starting now.

483
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:13,760
Who are they...

484
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,300
Who are they even shooting at?

485
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,360
They don't even know they're stupid.

486
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:17,740
Oh my god.

487
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:18,720
He doesn't see me.

488
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,380
He doesn't see you.

489
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:19,980
He doesn't see you.

490
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,000
He doesn't see me.

491
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,200
Can't see me if he's dead.

492
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,780
Okay, starting now.

493
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,560
Okay, starting now.

494
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,620
How did he see you?

495
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:32,720
Exactly!

496
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,180
How did he see me?

497
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,680
Oh my god, he's literally right there, right above me.

498
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,100
Oh yeah, he sees you.

499
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,940
Oh yeah, no, he definitely sees me.

500
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,460
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Whoa!

503
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,180
But they're stupid, silly little guys.

504
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,060
They don't know where you go once you hide again.

505
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:50,720
They don't know.

506
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,580
Yeah, they don't know.

507
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,300

00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,740
It's technically stuff.

594
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,840
Go to your map, because you'll want to see the map for this
area.

595
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,560
It's like all the yellow dot all the way up there.

And there's like only certain, like there's little, see how

The trenches, yeah.

600
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,900
Sometimes you can get through certain ways in the trenches,
and sometimes you can't.

601
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:40,420
You got to like...

602

Yeah, I said I'm on fire.

605
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:49,950
Yeah, yeah, we gotta get him out of here.

606
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:52,850
It's the most silent way to kill.

607
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:53,890
Wait, can I...

608
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:55,830
Can I shoot that and it'll explode?

609
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:57,430
Oh, probably.

610
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:58,110

00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,730
There is a helicopter that's around.

614
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:03,690
It will attack you if you start, you know.

615
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:04,710
If you go into alert.

616
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:05,790
Oh.

617
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,370
Wait, then what's the point?

618
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:09,190
What if I throw a grenade?

619
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:11,090
Will it alert me?

620
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:14,610

00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:11,490
Sick.

682
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:12,690
Barely noticeable.

683
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:13,590
Oh, that's fine.

684
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:15,070
Alright.

685
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:18,190
That's tasty.

686
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:20,150
Okay, it was pretty stealthy.

687
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:24,250
It was stealthy until...

688
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:24,790
Until...

689
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:27,770
I forgot to put on the suppressor.

690
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:29,470
Yeah, that's true.

691
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:31,050
It was the suppressor's fault.

692
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:34,870
And I did take down the helicopter.

693
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:37,810
Alright, maybe he has more food for me.

694
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:38,890
Wait, is that him?

695
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:40,230
Where is he?

696
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:42,110
Wait behind him.

697
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:43,570
He's right behind me.

698
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:45,010
No, no, down, down, down, down.

699
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:47,710
There's nobody down here.

700
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:48,690
There is a guy.

701
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:49,770
There was a guy standing there.

702
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:51,730
I'm just gonna get rid of this.

703
00:44:53,330 --> 00:44:53,770
Really?

704
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:57,090
He's so fast!

705
00:44:57,310 --> 00:44:58,450
Oh wait, is that food?

706
00:44:58,930 --> 00:44:59,390
What is this?

707
00:44:59,670 --> 00:44:59,670
No.

708
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:00,850
Oh, no, yeah.

709
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:03,250
Okay, surely you don't know I'm here, right?

710
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:03,710
Wait, what?

711
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:04,990
Oh, never mind.

712
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:05,630
Yeah, yeah.

713
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:07,410
Oh, they might.

714
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:08,090
It depends.

715
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:08,750
No, no, it's fine.

716
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:10,390
See, they don't know.

717
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:15,330
Yeah, by the way, you can't go into the next area unless
you're not in an alert mode.

718
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:16,530
Are you fucking- Okay, okay.

719
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:17,110
Alright.

720
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:18,810
Don't worry, I got this.

721
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:20,210
I'm so stealthy.

722
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:20,650
Yeah.

723
00:45:20,810 --> 00:45:23,390
Okay, how far am I from the next area?

724
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:24,790
Oh, I'm almost there.

725
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:25,850
I'm almost there.

726
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:27,030
Here we go.

727
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:28,750
All right.

728
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:31,650
And then...

729
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:34,070
Wait, I could technically take down the helicopter.

730
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:36,070
You could.

731
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:37,510
Yeah, yeah.

732
00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:39,670
Okay.

733
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:41,550
Do you think he knows I'm here?

734
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:42,630
Bombing this area.

735
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:44,310
I'm going to pee while...

736
00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:47,570
Trust that no one will know.

737
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:49,030
No, nobody's going to come in.

738
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:50,050
I trust my house.

739
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:51,710
I'm going to use the bathroom real quick.

740
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:52,850
I trust my house.

741
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:53,790
Okay.

742
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:56,030
She's not...

743
00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:56,630
Oh, okay.

744
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:00,090
Trust guys, trust.

745
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:02,590
Trust?

746
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:06,670
I don't think they'll search during caution.

747
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,080
I think she's fine.

748
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:21,740
I can hear the guy who's saying that.

749
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:23,300
He's close.

750
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,680
I don't think they'll come in here.

751
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:29,360
during caution.

752
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,300
I think she's okay.

753
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,340
That better guy walks in.

754
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:39,860
See?

755
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:41,320
I told you.

756
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,840
I told you I was safe.

757
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:45,200
Look at that.

758
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:46,820
It's going down.

759
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:47,760
Yeah!

760
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:49,620
Look at that.

761
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:51,560
No one knows.

762
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,160
No one knows.

763
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,200
How could they know?

764
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:58,580
The Doki strats always work 100% of the time.

765
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:00,540
Yeah.

766
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:03,020
As we've, as has been demonstrated.

767
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,280
Nine out of ten times the Doki Strat works 100% of the time.

768
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:09,360
All right.

769
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,840
Now I go outside.

770
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:19,820
And then...

771
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:22,420
No, why?

772
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:24,140
No.

773
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:26,100
Get his feet from under the door.

774
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:26,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

775
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:27,540
That's the Strat.

776
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:30,420
Cool.

777
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,380
Oh, is he coming?

778
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:34,640
Is he coming?

779
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:36,980
Wait, I know an idea.

780
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:40,400
Oh,

781
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:45,220
what's that?

782
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:46,220
What's that?

783
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:47,200
What's that?

784
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:48,340
What's that?

785
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:49,640
What's that?

786
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,440
Is he not coming?

787
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:55,640
Well, how will you know if you don't hear?

788
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:57,540
Oh, he walked away.

789
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:00,720
They're so stupid.

790
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:08,820

794
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:34,690
Oh, you should have killed him.

795
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:35,870
You should have killed him when he had the chance.

796
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:36,510
Oh, shit.

797
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:37,830
Oh, shit.

798
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:40,210
Oh, okay, it's fine.

799
00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:43,770

Oh, oh, why your ass?

There we go.

810
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:32,910
There it is.

811
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:33,450
There it is.

812
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:33,910
There it is.

813
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:34,450

00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:36,690
And then...

815
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:40,240
Oh yeah.

816
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:41,920
They'll never know.

817
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,880
And then watch this.

818
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:45,740
Okay, not that.

819
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:46,240
Not that.

820
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,020
Not that.

821
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:47,720
Watch this.

822
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:49,520
I'm gonna be like... BAM!

823
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:51,560
And then...

824
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:54,000
Holy fuck, how many people are shooting me?

825
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:55,780
Oh, they broke the door!

826
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:57,260
Not my door!

827
00:49:58,440 --> 00:49:59,240
Oh man.

828
00:49:59,260 --> 00:49:59,840
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

829
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,800
Do I have to keep watching or...

830
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:02,640
No, no, no, no.

831
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:03,280
Watch this.

832
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:03,860
Watch this.

833
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,040
It's going to work.

834
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:12,000
And then...

835
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:12,620
Oh, shit.

836
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:13,160

Oh, shit.

00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,080
I can't...

840
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:16,880
How do you...

841
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:17,600
Oh, my God.

842
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,320
Why am I...

843
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,140
Snake, get up, get up, get up.

844
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:22,800
Snake, please.

845
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:24,260
I'm...

846
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:25,300
Snake, please.

847
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:26,240
No!

848
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:36,780
Oh, he's dead.

849
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:37,100
Okay.

850
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:41,620
How did the guy die?

851
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:42,620
No!

852
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:44,360
That's okay.

853
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:44,860
That's okay.

854
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:47,780
Watch this.

855
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:50,220
Wait, he didn't...

856
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:52,380
He will go down eventually, you know.

857
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:53,520
Like, you could just wait.

858
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:56,240
You could have patience and, like, they'll eventually get...

859
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:57,820
They'll have...

860
00:50:57,820 --> 00:50:58,700
You don't have to keep shooting.

861
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:00,640
Oh!

862
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:01,340
Nice.

863
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:01,700
Yeah.

864
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:02,360
Alright.

865
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:06,820
See, okay, now... Now stealth mode starts now.

866
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:08,080
Set him on fire.

867
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,900
Yeah, you know the drill.

868
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:11,860
You know the drill.

869
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:22,640
all right and then just like last time i'll be right back
i'm gonna get a snack

870
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:35,720
it works nine or ten times it works a hundred percent of the
time just like that

871
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:43,770
starting now

872
00:51:51,220 --> 00:52:01,480
stealth Okay.

873
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:05,940
Oh, oh, I didn't mean to pick him up.

874
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:07,240
Oh, I didn't mean to pick him up.

875
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:08,520
Oh, free loot though.

876
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:11,340
Okay, like that fire.

877
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:13,660
And then burn!

878
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:16,160
There we go.

879
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:16,860
Stealth.

880
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:20,540
And then watch this.

881
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:32,100
we go into my little house my little stealth house I grab
some more ammo and then I eat some food.

882
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:32,520
Oh my god.

883
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:34,240
And then look, I'm making it.

884
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:34,800
Look at that.

885
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:35,220
Look at that.

886
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,400
I learned my lesson.

887
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:42,400
I learned how I learned my lesson.

888
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:43,000
Look at that.

889
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:43,680
Look, look.

890
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:45,600
We're still here.

891
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:48,560
There's a hole to your left.

892
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:49,620
It could go in there if you wanted.

893
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:50,760
Wait, there is?

894
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:52,080
There's no hole.

895
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:52,620
No.

896
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:53,620
No, in the trench.

897
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:54,500
Oh.

898
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:59,220
I see it.

899
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:00,540
All right.

900
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:03,140
But no bump.

901
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:05,120
Wait, does it not take me back to downstairs?

902
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:06,540
Oh, yeah.

903
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:07,420
Well, I mean.

904
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:11,880
I didn't tell you where it would go.

905
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:13,180
I'm just saying there's a hole.

906
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:17,740
Oh, you mean the other hole over here that takes me upstairs
instead?

907
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,900
I mean, that's, I mean, you can go into any little hole that
you want.

908
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:22,900
Yeah, all right, all right.

909
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,880
Someone doesn't know their lefts and right.

910
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:30,750
This is a little freaky.

911
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:36,820
Oh my god, where are they?

912
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:39,400
No!

913
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:40,340
No!

914
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:44,240
Get his face!

915
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:49,000
Because it's a trick!

916
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:53,460
Immediately pulls out the RPGs.

917
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:54,420
Nice.

918
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:04,660
If I'm going down, I'm taking him down with me.

919
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:08,600
Alright.

920
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:14,300
Oh no, oh no, where do I hide?

921
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:20,480
Okay.

922
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:24,670
Push my torch.

923
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:26,130
Wait, where is it?

924
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:26,410
Oh, there.

925
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:29,470
Just leave him.

926
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:30,470
Just leave him.

927
00:54:30,830 --> 00:54:32,290
You're not even- It's not even lit!

928
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:33,510
No man left behind!

929
00:54:34,330 --> 00:54:34,910
Oh shit!

930
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:40,150
Okay, maybe one man left behind.

931
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:44,870
Oh!

932
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:46,030
Friendly fire?

933
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:49,910
Friendly fire?

934
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:52,330
No man- Now keep going to- keep going to your- right?

935
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:53,750
Yeah, turn- go straight.

936
00:54:54,770 --> 00:54:55,390
There you go.

937
00:54:55,810 --> 00:54:57,290
A man left behind.

938
00:54:59,790 --> 00:55:00,730
It's okay, it's okay.

939
00:55:00,810 --> 00:55:01,530
Everything is fine.

940
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:03,290
It's just one helicopter.

941
00:55:05,730 --> 00:55:08,110
It's just one tiny little helicopter.

942
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:09,810
That's tasty.

943
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:12,490
All right.

944
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:15,570
And now that I'm fully recovered.

945
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:20,070
Well, your stamina is fully recovered, not your health.

946
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:21,870
Now that I'm fully recovered.

947
00:55:23,950 --> 00:55:24,390
Oh my god.

948
00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:24,970
Where the fuck?

949
00:55:25,330 --> 00:55:25,630
It's okay.

950
00:55:25,870 --> 00:55:26,210
It's okay.

951
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:26,970
It's okay.

952
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:28,230
This is no man's land.

953
00:55:31,990 --> 00:55:33,490
Look, look, guys.

954
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:35,750
Just get out of the alert.

955
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:36,470
We did it.

956
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:36,930
We did it.

957
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:37,110
We did it.

958
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:37,270
Yay!

959
00:55:38,270 --> 00:55:38,450
Yeah.

960
00:55:38,770 --> 00:55:40,010
Oh, see, I told you.

961
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:41,490
I'm not good at stealth.

962
00:55:44,990 --> 00:55:47,730
Might be the most stealthy player in Metal Gear Solid.

963
00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:51,350
How did I let you win?

964
00:55:53,990 --> 00:55:54,870
Never punished.

965
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:55,750
What can I say?

966
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:04,210
Oh!

967
00:56:05,350 --> 00:56:05,790
Mommy?

968
00:56:08,850 --> 00:56:09,290
Mommy?

969
00:56:09,290 --> 00:56:09,670
Mommy?

970
00:56:10,190 --> 00:56:10,570
Mommy?

971
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:13,070
Whoa!

972
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:15,890
Oh god, oh yeah, she needs to breathe through her skin.

973
00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:17,470
She's pretty quiet.

974
00:56:19,090 --> 00:56:20,350
It's the beta test.

975
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:22,170
Hasn't left me much time to sleep.

976
00:56:22,890 --> 00:56:23,870
Where'd you get those cuts?

977
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:25,070
The Colonel.

978
00:56:25,770 --> 00:56:26,810
He found out.

979
00:56:27,570 --> 00:56:29,030
If he knew I'd be dead already.

980
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:31,050
No, this is his hobby.

981
00:56:31,790 --> 00:56:32,630
He's a sadist.

982
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:33,890
Oh shit.

983
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:35,530
Yeah, he's freaky.

984
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:37,010
That's a freaky man.

985
00:56:41,330 --> 00:56:41,810
Whoa.

986
00:56:45,350 --> 00:56:48,110
Oh, yeah.

987
00:56:48,330 --> 00:56:49,630
I'm the same way.

988
00:56:50,270 --> 00:56:51,010
Scars all over.

989
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:54,270
The Croc mask is just too sexy.

990
00:56:57,350 --> 00:56:58,470
Where'd you get this one?

991
00:56:59,110 --> 00:57:01,010
I got it after defecting to the Soviet Union.

992
00:57:02,270 --> 00:57:03,210
I don't think so.

993
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:04,490
It's older than that.

994
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:07,310
Code breaking is a desk job.

995
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:08,790
Where'd you get this kind of scar?

996
00:57:08,810 --> 00:57:09,210
Yeah.

997
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:11,970
You're not a cracker.

998
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:13,810
You want to know how I got these scars?

999
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:14,330
Yeah.

1000
00:57:17,010 --> 00:57:19,250
A girl's got to have some secrets here.

1001
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:21,990
She's like...

1002
00:57:21,990 --> 00:57:23,890
It's like in her head.

1003
00:57:23,990 --> 00:57:26,170
These two trials, a shaggle hot is about to start.

1004
00:57:26,370 --> 00:57:28,690
And it looks like someone might be coming to spoil the
party.

1005
00:57:30,370 --> 00:57:31,990
The master is on.

1006
00:57:33,710 --> 00:57:36,210
The colonel is gathering his troops together to meet them.

1007
00:57:37,430 --> 00:57:40,170
If we don't get a move on, the security will be even
tighter.

1008
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:41,030
than it is now.

1009
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:45,330
You'll need this key.

1010
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:48,330
It unlocks the door to the underground tunnel.

1011
00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:52,270
Once you're in there, you can follow the tunnel to get
inside Groznygrad.

1012
00:57:53,290 --> 00:57:54,450
Oh, yeah, Groznygrad.

1013
00:57:55,410 --> 00:57:56,090
Oh, hey, ramen.

1014
00:57:57,470 --> 00:57:59,210
How did she get Japanese ramen?

1015
00:57:59,670 --> 00:58:00,610
What is this?

1016
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:02,430
What are these funny characters?

1017
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:04,370
Food of the future.

1018
00:58:05,830 --> 00:58:07,810
It's good to eat some real food once in a while.

1019
00:58:08,490 --> 00:58:09,290
Instant ramen.

1020
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:11,050
I know.

1021
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:13,550
Don't forget the R1.

1022
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:14,850
Oh.

1023
00:58:14,850 --> 00:58:16,490
I'll bet if I kissed you.

1024
00:58:16,590 --> 00:58:19,830
You taste like a wild beast.

1025
00:58:20,990 --> 00:58:22,690
Fucking crock the towel.

1026
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:29,270
Do you know where exactly in Grosnagrad, Sokolov is located?

1027
00:58:29,930 --> 00:58:32,150
He's in the heart of the fortress, the weapons lab.

1028
00:58:33,350 --> 00:58:36,110
The weapons lab is divided into three wings.

1029
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:37,610
Oh my god.

1030
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:38,450
Here comes my man.

1031
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:39,630
The man.

1032
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:43,190
Yeah, Raikov.

1033
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:45,590
That's where the Shadowhawk is.

1034
00:58:47,030 --> 00:58:50,950
Finally, there's the West Wing which is connected via a
passageway to the main building.

1035
00:58:51,930 --> 00:58:53,110
That's where Sokolov is.

1036
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:57,070
To get in, you'll have to enter the main wing from the East
Wing.

1037
00:58:57,930 --> 00:59:01,170
Then go through the passageway on the second floor of the
main wing.

1038
00:59:01,910 --> 00:59:03,610
The West Wing of the Weapons Lab.

1039
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,250
Oh, got it.

1040
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:08,110
There's just one problem.

1041
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:09,670
Not again.

1042
00:59:10,190 --> 00:59:13,230
The West Wing is protected by the highest level of security.

1043
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:19,790
You need to be Colonel class to get in Colonel class Here,
look at this picture.

1044
00:59:21,710 --> 00:59:25,430
Major Ivan Rydanovich Rykov Pretend you're him.

1045
00:59:25,870 --> 00:59:26,210
I'm right.

1046
00:59:27,050 --> 00:59:31,890
I'm pretending to be Russian Yeah, you're pretending to be
this dude.

1047
00:59:32,330 --> 00:59:32,770
Oh Fuck.

1048
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:38,090
You're pretending to be Volgan's lover His little his twink.

1049
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:41,370
Yeah, you're pretending to be his Twink, yeah, yeah.

1050
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:43,730
Oh my god, there's a little boy toy.

1051
00:59:45,530 --> 00:59:46,290
Break up!

1052
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:49,630
You're gonna like this part.

1053
00:59:52,110 --> 00:59:53,010
Is that me?

1054
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:54,690
That will be you.

1055
00:59:55,090 --> 00:59:56,150
You gotta steal his clothes.

1056
00:59:56,570 --> 00:59:58,870
Oh, I'm gonna strip him, aren't that?

1057
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:00,550
Yep.

1058
01:00:01,290 --> 01:00:02,350
He's a little meow meow.

1059
01:00:03,190 --> 01:00:04,370
Get Sokolov out of there.

1060
01:00:05,630 --> 01:00:08,150
Command said you're supposed to have something ready for me.

1061
01:00:08,990 --> 01:00:09,510
And I do.

1062
01:00:12,970 --> 01:00:17,950
It's our little sensor, you know, the black eye sensor bar.

1063
01:00:18,930 --> 01:00:20,970
I know, it's too, like, cinematic.

1064
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:24,670
I can't fly one of those.

1065
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:26,370
That's okay.

1066
01:00:27,230 --> 01:00:29,030
I happen to be an excellent pilot.

1067
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:30,490
Oh, yeah.

1068
01:00:30,510 --> 01:00:32,730
Taking off from a lake is trickier than it looks.

1069
01:00:33,110 --> 01:00:34,590
It's not like riding a motorcycle.

1070
01:00:34,830 --> 01:00:36,190
You've got to be more delicate.

1071
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:37,310
Of course I will.

1072
01:00:37,390 --> 01:00:39,090
You've seen how good I am with the bike, right?

1073

She wants that croc.

1081
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,220
Don't say that.

1082
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:57,040
It's very true though.

1083
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:02,970
Well, she likes it.

1084
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:05,550
The croc cat like opening its mouth every time.

1085
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:06,810
Yeah, girl.

1086
01:02:08,830 --> 01:02:11,810
I've never been interested in other people's lives.

1087
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:14,130
You were interested.

1088
01:02:14,370 --> 01:02:29,430
i'm the main character she was different damn how do you

Snake?

1092
01:02:47,370 --> 01:02:48,590
He's not reciprocating.

1093
01:02:48,990 --> 01:02:50,990
Oh, she's like, my first kiss.

1094
01:02:51,530 --> 01:02:53,230
Look at him, he's just standing there.

1095
01:02:54,410 --> 01:02:56,890
He's like, his first kiss.

1096
01:02:59,110 --> 01:03:00,810
Like, oh, no, goodies.

1097
01:03:01,430 --> 01:03:03,310
Oh, no, goodies.

1098
01:03:04,550 --> 01:03:05,450
What's wrong?

1099
01:03:06,170 --> 01:03:08,410
I never learned to kiss in the mission.

1100
01:03:09,890 --> 01:03:12,490
This wasn't in the guidebook.

1101
01:03:12,490 --> 01:03:14,530
Mommy didn't teach me this.

1102
01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:14,850
Mommy.

1103
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:16,130
Mommy?

1104
01:03:16,610 --> 01:03:17,050
Mommy?

1105
01:03:17,450 --> 01:03:19,530
Why did you teach me this, Mommy?

1106
01:03:21,950 --> 01:03:22,390
Oh.

1107
01:03:23,810 --> 01:03:25,390
This part, this part's good.

1108
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:30,170
Yeah, Grozny Grand.

1109
01:03:30,330 --> 01:03:31,170
See you around, Snake.

1110
01:03:31,890 --> 01:03:32,690
Take care of yourself.

1111
01:03:33,110 --> 01:03:33,810
What about you?

1112
01:03:35,490 --> 01:03:36,070
CQK.

1113
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:38,510
Are you going to be okay?

1114
01:03:39,170 --> 01:03:39,730
Not sure.

1115
01:03:39,830 --> 01:03:41,570
They're not stupid.

1116
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:42,830
They know there's a spy.

1117
01:03:43,950 --> 01:03:45,430
There's no way you could have gotten that.

1118
01:03:47,570 --> 01:03:49,030
What's that supposed to mean?

1119
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:55,830
The guy in the standing like totally bloodied up with his
crock hat on.

1120
01:03:59,610 --> 01:04:00,130
Damn.

1121
01:04:03,850 --> 01:04:06,930
Ma'am, your jacket is still zipped down, ma'am.

1122
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:16,050

1123
01:04:18,210 --> 01:04:23,050

01:04:47,170 --> 01:04:49,370
Wait, there was a person in there?

01:04:51,850 --> 01:04:52,710
Oh shit.

1127
01:04:54,530 --> 01:04:55,490
Ripperoni.

1128
01:04:57,030 --> 01:05:00,490
Oh, I think he's dead, dead.

1129
01:05:03,890 --> 01:05:04,470
Granite!

1130
01:05:04,590 --> 01:05:05,630
It's grandpa!

1131
01:05:06,910 --> 01:05:07,570
No.

1132
01:05:08,030 --> 01:05:11,450
He can't put legs on tanks anymore!

1133
01:05:14,070 --> 01:05:14,550
No!

1134
01:05:15,410 --> 01:05:16,250
His dream!

1135
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:29,140
Do we think he's okay?

1136
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:32,760
What's that?

1137
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:35,960
That tracker in his shoes.

1138
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:37,180
Huh?

1139
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:37,960
Exactly.

1140
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:41,260
Planted to keep someone informed of his location.

1141
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:44,100
Oh, shit.

1142
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:50,340
Does this mean Granon was the spy?

1143
01:05:51,260 --> 01:06:02,700
perhaps he was being used by someone else perhaps this man
was our comrade comrade or not he's of no use to us now I

1144
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:16,160
mean he's dead so yeah I don't need your approval oh he has
daddy and mommy issues and that nuclear shell still feeling

01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:24,240
sore about that are you what are you gonna do report it to
the authorities This is war, Major.

1146
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:25,860
The Cold War.

1147
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:28,740
Caught with information and espionage.

1148
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:30,440
Not the Cold War.

1149
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,460
Spies wherever they hide.

1150
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,700
Look at his thighs, man.

1151
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:38,680
Potential threats must be weeded out.

1152
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:41,640
Your feelings are a mess.

1153
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:42,940
This is the unity of our organization.

1154
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:46,160
Someone is guiding the enemy's hand.

1155
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:49,600
A single man can only accomplish so much.

1156
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:57,660
make no mistake there is a spy among us but casting
suspicion among us the c3 explosives have been stolen you

I just noticed that that's her.

1161
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:36,080
It's like Superman where you put the glasses on.

1162
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:37,820
It is!

1163
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:41,860
It works!

1164
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:44,080
She put on the glasses and

1165
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:48,870
I...

1166
01:07:48,870 --> 01:07:50,050
He's good.

1167
01:07:50,790 --> 01:07:50,890

I thought it's just some oh man.

1172
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:11,040
It's pretty fucked.

1173
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:12,540
That's fucked up man.

1174
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:13,740
I wonder when that happened

1175
01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:18,020
Huh?

1176
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:22,140
Why the fuck did she bring a horse to kill me as well?

1177
01:08:22,860 --> 01:08:28,160
That's her horse colonel tighten the security on this place
He's coming here.

1178
01:08:28,260 --> 01:08:29,130
I'm sure of it.

1179
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:34,660
I'm going to get the Davy Crockett.

1180
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:35,900
The Davy Crockett.

1181
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:37,460
I thought that's in America.

1182
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:40,160
No, the thing that...

1183
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:40,620
Oh, the giant...

1184
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:40,920
Yeah.

1185
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:42,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1186
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:44,940
Clark Kent is Superman.

1187
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:46,080
No way.

1188
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:47,180
No way.

1189
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:47,740
But it works!

1190
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:48,620
The glasses!

1191
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:53,220
She put on glasses.

1192
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:54,200
I could never tell.

1193
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:55,800
Yeah.

1194
01:08:55,820 --> 01:09:01,440

01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:27,900
nice boots

1197
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:35,580
They're scuffed.

1198
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:37,520
There's sand on it.

1199
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:42,320
Yeah, finger guns.

1200
01:09:42,780 --> 01:09:44,260
He's such a little loser.

1201
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:46,100
I love this so much.

1202
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:49,220
Yeah, no, he's definitely the bottom.

1203
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:50,420
Oh.

1204
01:10:02,210 --> 01:10:03,710
Okay, so bad news.

1205
01:10:03,870 --> 01:10:06,290
You have to go back through that previous area you were just
at.

1206
01:10:07,310 --> 01:10:09,610
No, surely I can...

1207
01:10:09,610 --> 01:10:09,770
Oh.

1208
01:10:12,430 --> 01:10:12,910
Yeah.

1209
01:10:13,650 --> 01:10:14,070
No.

1210
01:10:16,850 --> 01:10:17,330
No.

1211
01:10:18,950 --> 01:10:21,150
Where do I go from there?

1212
01:10:21,790 --> 01:10:23,750
So there's going to be a red door.

1213
01:10:24,130 --> 01:10:24,530
Okay.

1214
01:10:24,770 --> 01:10:25,530
That you go to.

1215
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:26,150
That door?

1216
01:10:27,550 --> 01:10:29,630
Also, search this area because you'll get stuff.

1217
01:10:29,790 --> 01:10:30,510
Oh, yeah, ramen noodles.

1218
01:10:30,970 --> 01:10:31,830
Yeah, get your noodles.

1219
01:10:32,070 --> 01:10:33,250
Get your stuff down there, dear.

1220
01:10:33,830 --> 01:10:35,070
Oh, yeah, there's the red door.

1221
01:10:35,990 --> 01:10:36,290
Yeah.

1222
01:10:37,510 --> 01:10:40,870
The one that you walk through to get to the previous area.

1223
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:47,200
Alright.

1224
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:49,140
And now...

1225
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:50,260
Where the fuck is that?

1226
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:54,400
It's like a little past the, um...

1227
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,760
The storage room that you were in.

1228
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:57,560
Alright.

1229
01:10:57,780 --> 01:10:59,540
Don't worry, I'm stealthing.

1230
01:11:01,780 --> 01:11:04,500
Surely there's no more defense down here, right?

1231
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:07,200
Oh yeah, those guys are long gone.

1232
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:08,840
Yeah, yeah, I'm pretty sure.

1233
01:11:10,740 --> 01:11:12,900
Okay, so the guys are gone, right?

1234
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:14,020
Who's that?

1235
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:19,980
Oh yeah, the fire, um, the flamethrowers?

1236
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:28,600
So, the fire, I guess.

1237
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:31,320
I did warn you about those guys.

1238
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:32,640
To be fair.

1239
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:48,240
All right.

1240
01:11:49,660 --> 01:11:50,520
I'm ready.

1241
01:11:52,580 --> 01:11:53,060
Oh, yeah.

1242
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:54,080
I'm ready.

1243
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:54,480
Oh.

1244
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:56,980
Okay.

1245
01:11:58,120 --> 01:11:58,880
There we go.

1246
01:11:59,660 --> 01:12:00,040
Nice.

1247
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:00,800
That's fine.

1248
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:05,780
I'll just head down.

1249
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:09,380
Nice.

1250
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:09,880
Oh.

1251
01:12:10,180 --> 01:12:10,640
All right.

1252
01:12:11,140 --> 01:12:11,280
Oh.

1253
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:11,940

1254
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:12,720
All right.

01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:14,400
Nice.

1256
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:15,680
There we go.

1257
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:20,560
I would just climb up there.

1258
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:20,840
Really?

1259
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:21,540
Alright.

1260
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:26,300
Wait, where is it?

1261
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:26,820
Down here?

1262
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:29,280
Oh, there's more guys.

1263
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:32,620

1264
01:12:33,380 --> 01:12:34,320
Yeah, where are they?

1266
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:36,440
There it is.

1267
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:36,980
Alright.

1268
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:39,500
So you're playing Apex!

1269
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:41,200
Not Apex.

1270
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:42,240
Oh, what do you play now?

1271
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:42,840
Rivals!

1272
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,880
No, this is just Apex.

1273
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:47,700
Oh yeah, so you're playing Apex!

1274
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:50,140
Oh, hey, there's a bird.

1275
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:51,220
Yeah.

1276
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:51,960
All right.

1277
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:53,760
Nice shot.

1278
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:54,540
It's like right below there.

1279
01:12:55,220 --> 01:12:56,640
All right, that means I can just...

1280
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:57,200
Come in, HQ.

1281
01:12:58,100 --> 01:12:58,900
Yeah, just drop down.

1282
01:12:59,240 --> 01:12:59,760
Oh, shit.

1283
01:12:59,980 --> 01:13:00,420
Okay, wait.

1284
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:01,000
Control here.

1285
01:13:02,060 --> 01:13:02,960
We've lost the enemy.

1286
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:05,600
All right.

1287
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:06,020
Like it.

1288
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:06,860
Now, just drop down.

1289
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:07,320
Just drop down.

1290
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:10,100
Yeah, but I just wanted to...

1291
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:11,260
Oh, oh, you missed.

1292
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:11,640
Oh, there it is.

1293
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:11,940
There it is.

1294
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:12,440
There it is.

1295
01:13:12,540 --> 01:13:12,880
Yay.

1296
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:14,340
Yay, easy.

01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:18,800
Yay!

1300
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,660
It's just that easy.

1301
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:22,600
Look at that.

1302
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:24,340
All right.

1303
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:26,120
Now, now back to control.

1304
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:27,380
All right, back to stealth.

1305
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:29,880
And remember how there was like the Cobra unit.

1306
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:30,780
Yeah.

1307
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:33,200

Was he?

1310
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:37,280
Wait, you missed an item.

01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:40,840
So who is the last guy?

1314
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:41,820
Oh, it's a grenade.

1315
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:42,120
You'll see.

1316
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:43,060
Oh, it's just grenade.

Space.

Wait, he has a helmet?

1333
01:15:20,870 --> 01:15:21,830

01:15:24,410 --> 01:15:25,590
He's spaceman!

1335
01:15:26,470 --> 01:15:29,870
Bro, Glass is not going to protect you from a bullet.

1336
01:15:33,430 --> 01:15:35,510
He looks so cool.

1337
01:15:36,890 --> 01:15:37,950
Oh my god.

1338
01:15:39,110 --> 01:15:41,110
He is among us.

1339
01:15:41,790 --> 01:15:44,070
I am the fury.

1340
01:15:44,210 --> 01:15:45,090
Oh, the fury.

1341
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:47,950
Yes.

1342
01:15:49,190 --> 01:15:50,350
Why are you so mad?

1343
01:15:50,990 --> 01:15:51,530
I came back from space.

1344
01:15:51,850 --> 01:15:54,010
He came back from space.

1345
01:15:54,630 --> 01:15:56,090
I had one vision.

1346
01:15:56,250 --> 01:15:58,250
The world set ablaze.

1347
01:15:58,490 --> 01:16:00,510
And do you know what I saw this?

1348
01:16:00,510 --> 01:16:04,590
Chad, doesn't he kind of look like the Luden's mascot now?

1349
01:16:05,630 --> 01:16:06,490
The what mascot?

1350
01:16:08,830 --> 01:16:09,970
Kojima's, like, mascot.

1351
01:16:10,230 --> 01:16:11,470
Oh, he's the skeleton boy.

1352
01:16:11,950 --> 01:16:12,450
Yeah, yeah.

1353
01:16:12,670 --> 01:16:14,450
Oh, my God, you can fly?

1354
01:16:15,250 --> 01:16:15,770
Yeah.

1355
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:17,230
He has a jet pack.

1356
01:16:20,790 --> 01:16:25,210
Now, you're going to feel the scorching heat of that
horrible blackness.

1357
01:16:27,010 --> 01:16:28,130
Oh shit!

1358
01:16:30,330 --> 01:16:31,210
Ah yeah!

1359
01:16:31,730 --> 01:16:33,470
Alright, let me grab my AK.

1360
01:16:34,650 --> 01:16:36,370
Oh, sure.

1361
01:16:36,730 --> 01:16:37,590
Let me grab my AK.

1362
01:16:38,830 --> 01:16:39,770
Um, oh wait.

1363
01:16:40,450 --> 01:16:42,750
And RPG might work also.

1364
01:16:45,230 --> 01:16:45,750
Where is he?

1365
01:16:48,110 --> 01:16:49,110
Oh my god!

1366
01:16:49,770 --> 01:16:50,450
There's him!

1367
01:16:50,750 --> 01:16:51,530
Where is he?

1368
01:16:52,730 --> 01:16:55,450
Where would- what do you- how far does this fire go?

1369
01:16:56,370 --> 01:16:57,070
Pretty far.

1370
01:16:57,190 --> 01:16:58,170
It goes down the whole tunnel.

1371
01:16:59,370 --> 01:16:59,410
Oh.

1372
01:17:00,510 --> 01:17:01,630
That's not good.

1373
01:17:01,930 --> 01:17:02,610
I see him.

1374
01:17:02,670 --> 01:17:03,270
He's right there.

1375
01:17:03,330 --> 01:17:03,910
You see him?

1376
01:17:04,050 --> 01:17:05,070
He peeked out on me.

1377
01:17:05,490 --> 01:17:06,450
Yeah, I did see him too.

1378
01:17:08,170 --> 01:17:08,830
What is he doing?

1379
01:17:08,830 --> 01:17:11,190
He just kind of like walks up and down the aisles.

1380
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:13,650
What?

1381
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:16,130
He just walks around.

1382
01:17:16,290 --> 01:17:17,150
He's just walking around.

1383
01:17:17,970 --> 01:17:18,890
Where did he go?

1384
01:17:21,110 --> 01:17:21,510

I keep forgetting that.

1394
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:08,460
There we go.

1395
01:18:10,790 --> 01:18:11,490
Oh, my God.

1396
01:18:13,430 --> 01:18:15,150
Oh, didn't catch me.

01:18:16,110 --> 01:18:16,970
We're too slow.

1398
01:18:21,260 --> 01:18:22,370
Where did he go?

1399
01:18:23,090 --> 01:18:23,590
Oh, shit.

1401
01:18:27,130 --> 01:18:27,590
Keep him down.

1402

He's not that good at his job man Pretty bad at him.

1404
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:03,020
I'm not going to lie.

1405
01:19:04,780 --> 01:19:06,540
He's very bad at his job.

1406
01:19:10,260 --> 01:19:12,300
You're bullying him.

1407
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:15,140
Don't use the RPG.

1408
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:16,000
It's not worth it.

1409
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:17,440
It's not worth it.

1410
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:19,380
But I tapped all more ammo.

1411

We tried.

1590
01:29:50,650 --> 01:29:51,890
We wanted him to...

1591
01:29:51,890 --> 01:29:53,070
Well, he wasn't going to live regardless.

1592
01:29:53,510 --> 01:29:54,890
Can you, like, push him from the front?

1593
01:29:55,030 --> 01:29:55,630
I don't think so.

1594
01:29:55,710 --> 01:29:55,850
Yeah, I did.

1595
01:29:56,030 --> 01:29:56,610
I tried.

1596
01:29:56,910 --> 01:29:57,110
Yeah.

1597
01:29:57,810 --> 01:29:58,210
Yeah.

1598
01:29:58,670 --> 01:30:00,130
Like, we all...

1599
01:30:00,130 --> 01:30:01,510
I mean, he wasn't going to live regardless.

1600
01:30:01,910 --> 01:30:03,670
I was just wanted to hide his body.

1601
01:30:03,930 --> 01:30:06,850
You can hide them in, like, lockers and stuff, but...

1602
01:30:06,850 --> 01:30:07,510
Oh, yeah.

1603
01:30:07,510 --> 01:30:09,030
I don't think there's a locker near me.

1604
01:30:09,570 --> 01:30:09,910
No.

1605
01:30:10,590 --> 01:30:10,990
Alright.

1606
01:30:11,730 --> 01:30:12,130
Alright.

1607
01:30:12,290 --> 01:30:14,190
I would check the map and see where you got to go.

1608
01:30:14,310 --> 01:30:14,990
Oh, that's true.

1609
01:30:17,430 --> 01:30:17,830
Alright.

1610
01:30:17,890 --> 01:30:18,470
over there.

1611
01:30:19,030 --> 01:30:19,730
Grab this loot.

1612
01:30:22,010 --> 01:30:22,090
Uh-huh.

1613
01:30:22,870 --> 01:30:24,510
See, guys, I can still.

1614
01:30:26,650 --> 01:30:27,090
Look at that.

1615
01:30:27,290 --> 01:30:29,990
Are you, like, used to not, like, looking where you're
going?

1616
01:30:31,630 --> 01:30:35,010
Do you just, like, do you, like, never check ever?

1617
01:30:35,090 --> 01:30:36,610
Is that just how you play games?

1618
01:30:37,210 --> 01:30:39,350
There's, like, pure instinct, you know?

1619
01:30:41,290 --> 01:30:42,310
I didn't hit him.

1620
01:30:44,510 --> 01:30:47,870
I don't need to check when I could feel them.

1621
01:30:49,590 --> 01:30:51,210
You can feel them.

1622
01:30:51,370 --> 01:30:52,970
I can feel it.

1623
01:30:55,670 --> 01:30:55,690
Nice.

1624
01:31:00,810 --> 01:31:03,230
I don't think you have to kill each one.

1625
01:31:04,770 --> 01:31:06,030
I don't have to.

1626
01:31:07,370 --> 01:31:08,230
Don't give you a river.

1627
01:31:08,550 --> 01:31:09,330
Think of your river.

1628
01:31:09,610 --> 01:31:10,090
What river?

1629
01:31:10,230 --> 01:31:11,750
I thought we already bypassed the river.

1630
01:31:13,030 --> 01:31:14,010
With a sniper.

1631
01:31:14,910 --> 01:31:16,030
What are you talking about?

1632
01:31:18,010 --> 01:31:18,490
Okay.

1633
01:31:19,010 --> 01:31:19,630
You know where to go?

1634
01:31:20,010 --> 01:31:20,190

I can't strip this guy.

1681
01:33:54,440 --> 01:33:55,880
It has to be specifically him.

01:52:02,200 --> 01:52:11,940
know before he dies right you know yeah blind

1917
01:52:17,240 --> 01:52:26,080
tatiana how could she not see him run off this man is he's
built like a wall how could you not i know it's like those

1918
01:52:26,080 --> 01:52:36,740
shoes are making a tippy tappy noise yeah you're the man
from the cia it's me what are you doing here i told you

1919
01:52:36,740 --> 01:52:48,460
before didn't i i'm going to get you out of here honor just
like your commander but i'm afraid you're too late too late

1920
01:52:48,460 --> 01:52:54,860
too late tell me the shag of huds Uh-oh.

1921
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:55,780
Spaghetti-oh.

1922
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:58,980
Preparations for phase two are complete.

1923
01:53:00,140 --> 01:53:01,520
There's still phase three, right?

1924
01:53:01,800 --> 01:53:02,340
Phase two.

1925
01:53:03,500 --> 01:53:04,860
Maybe there's a phase three.

1926
01:53:05,600 --> 01:53:09,520
It's a composite range extension system for medium range
ballistic missiles.

1927
01:53:09,700 --> 01:53:11,080
I feel like it's time to go.

1928
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:14,400
The game audio is really quiet.

1929
01:53:14,500 --> 01:53:18,240
I feel like this game's audio balancing is all over the
place.

1930
01:53:18,640 --> 01:53:19,240
It really is.

1931
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:19,640
Yeah.

1932
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:22,340
That could launch nuclear missiles from any time.

1933
01:53:22,360 --> 01:53:33,680
of terrain it's phase three profit we couldn't figure out
how to solve the icbms we have today are simply too big for

1934
01:53:33,680 --> 01:53:42,240
the shagohod to carry but the military would not hear of it
they demanded a weapon that could launch a nuclear missile

1935
01:53:42,240 --> 01:53:51,760
directly into the american homeland that is when i came up
with the idea for phase two phase two but there's no way you

1936
01:53:51,760 --> 01:54:02,080
could load an cbm onto the shagohod so how do you do it by
accelerating the shagohod itself oh accelerating it it

1937
01:54:02,080 --> 01:54:11,020
doesn't make it go really fast it just has to go super duper
fast the unit incorporates the same technology used in the

1938
01:54:11,020 --> 01:54:21,600
Vostok rocket that sent major Gagarin into space you can do
the shagohod i can achieve a land speed of over 300 miles

1939
01:54:21,600 --> 01:54:25,800
per hour That monster can go more than 300 miles per hour.

1940
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:27,840
Holy shit, that's really fast!

1941
01:54:28,040 --> 01:54:31,620
From this state of accelerated motion, it launches a nuclear
missile.

1942
01:54:33,360 --> 01:54:35,000
But like, how does that help?

1943
01:54:35,480 --> 01:54:38,000
Shagohod acts like the first stage of a rocket.

1944
01:54:38,400 --> 01:54:38,440
Oh!

1945
01:54:40,420 --> 01:54:40,820
Yeah.

1946
01:54:41,140 --> 01:54:45,000
The range of the missile launched by the Shagohod thus
increases from...

1947
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,680
And then it has its little parachute to stop it.

1948
01:54:51,040 --> 01:54:52,340
I feel like...

1949
01:54:52,360 --> 01:54:53,920
That doesn't actually work.

1950
01:54:54,120 --> 01:54:58,160
I feel like physics wise that I think I'll recalculate the
math here.

1951
01:55:03,320 --> 01:55:10,560
All you need is three miles every time you want to launch a
rocket.

1952
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:14,060
It's like a plane.

1953
01:55:15,740 --> 01:55:16,520
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

1954
01:55:16,520 --> 01:55:17,500
It's like a missile plane.

1955
01:55:19,380 --> 01:55:21,620
Also, the parachute seems way too tiny.

1956
01:55:22,360 --> 01:55:24,220
There were three of them.

1957
01:55:24,980 --> 01:55:25,680
Yeah, three pairs.

1958
01:55:25,960 --> 01:55:28,660
One plus one plus one equals one big pair, too.

1959
01:55:31,560 --> 01:55:34,560
A completed prototype now sits in the hangar.

1960
01:55:35,020 --> 01:55:37,840
At present, it is the only one of its kind.

1961
01:55:38,820 --> 01:55:41,800
But Vulcan is planning to mass-produce them based on...

1962
01:55:41,800 --> 01:55:44,460
Everybody will be making their own three-mile...

1963
01:55:44,460 --> 01:55:46,000
Three-mile raft.

1964
01:55:46,500 --> 01:55:48,460
Yes, but that's not the end of it.

1965
01:55:49,440 --> 01:55:50,660
He's going to ship them to...

1966
01:55:52,360 --> 01:56:03,040
surveying like through satellite like who's building a three
mile runway okay but what if it's four miles undetectable

1967
01:56:03,040 --> 01:56:12,900
undetectable his funds are nearly limitless he could start
mass production tomorrow if he wanted the reason that

1968
01:56:12,900 --> 01:56:20,640
tensions between east and west have settled into a cold war
is because each side fears the other's power deterrence

1969
01:56:20,640 --> 01:56:30,380
deterrence using threats to keep one's enemy in check is the
perfect word to sum up this state of affairs but the

1970
01:56:30,380 --> 01:56:37,800
shagohan goes far beyond the level of threat it will render
the concept of deter yeah by the way don't keep this is like

1971
01:56:37,800 --> 01:56:45,340
a really long cut oh my god it's longer than the intro it
will not be long there's no way there's no way that's not i

1972
01:56:45,340 --> 01:56:46,720
think it's like a half hour long

1973
01:56:51,420 --> 01:56:54,320
All right, I paused a little.

1974
01:56:54,540 --> 01:56:55,460
Oh, wait, it's not paused.

1975
01:56:55,740 --> 01:56:55,960
Oops, sorry.

1976
01:56:56,080 --> 01:56:58,640
I wanted to up the thing a little bit more.

1977
01:56:59,100 --> 01:57:01,780
So you see, it's already too late.

1978
01:57:03,100 --> 01:57:04,520
I hope it's not too loud.

1979
01:57:04,880 --> 01:57:05,200
It's not too late.

1980
01:57:05,820 --> 01:57:06,380
What do you mean?

1981
01:57:07,740 --> 01:57:09,020
We've still got a chance.

1982
01:57:09,180 --> 01:57:13,180
All we have to do is destroy the prototype and the whole
facility before they can mass produce it.

1983
01:57:14,700 --> 01:57:16,700
But just tell me what I need to do to do.

1984
01:57:16,720 --> 01:57:27,920
destroy this place all right the liquid fuel used in the
rocket engine is stored in a tank if you can blow it up

1985
01:57:27,920 --> 01:57:37,400
somehow or is that easy some c3 ought to be enough to blow
the entire hangar to smith just get some c3 baby you mean

1986
01:57:37,400 --> 01:57:47,800
that cutting-edge plastic explosive it could be molded into
any shape the bomb of the future We're getting all sorts of

1987
01:57:47,800 --> 01:57:48,660
things in the future.

1988
01:57:48,860 --> 01:57:49,720
We got ramen.

1989
01:57:52,320 --> 01:57:53,340
Calorie, mate.

1990
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:55,680
No, that's not her name.

1991
01:57:56,200 --> 01:57:57,500
Her name is Tatiana.

1992
01:57:58,680 --> 01:57:59,200
Tatiana!

1993
01:57:59,740 --> 01:58:01,240
By becoming Vulcan's lover.

1994
01:58:03,140 --> 01:58:04,320
I thought she was your lover.

1995
01:58:04,700 --> 01:58:06,740
How many lovers does she have?

1996
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,140
Oh my god, we're gonna finally see his wife.

1997
01:58:10,700 --> 01:58:11,680
Wait, but what?

1998
01:58:12,500 --> 01:58:13,400
I thought she was.

1999
01:58:13,740 --> 01:58:14,580
Oh, okay.

2000
01:58:14,700 --> 01:58:15,700
What does she look like?

2001
01:58:16,720 --> 01:58:17,720
Check out his wife.

2002
01:58:19,320 --> 01:58:20,680
What's wrong with his wife?

2003
01:58:20,900 --> 01:58:21,800
Who are they?

2004
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:22,280
They?

2005
01:58:22,700 --> 01:58:23,340
Oh, okay.

2006
01:58:24,160 --> 01:58:24,380
Oh.

2007
01:58:25,120 --> 01:58:25,880
Oh.

2008
01:58:26,580 --> 01:58:26,760
Oh.

2009
01:58:27,200 --> 01:58:27,700
Oh.

2010
01:58:27,700 --> 01:58:29,120
Are they okay?

2011
01:58:29,880 --> 01:58:30,960
Are they ghosts?

2012
01:58:31,480 --> 01:58:33,680
Like, are they ghosts?

2013
01:58:33,700 --> 01:58:33,920
Like...

2014
01:58:33,920 --> 01:58:36,360
Did he know they're ghosts?

2015
01:58:39,340 --> 01:58:42,820
He finally saw her, the ugly one!

2016
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:50,020
Bro, it looks like some phasophobia shit.

2017
01:58:50,640 --> 01:58:54,980
Does he know?

2018
01:58:55,360 --> 01:58:56,220
Does he have?

2019
01:58:56,860 --> 01:59:01,160
Like, when you take a picture and then the ghost distorts
the fucking face, like shit.

2020
01:59:02,500 --> 01:59:03,500
She saw the tape.

2021
01:59:03,600 --> 01:59:04,680
She has seven days left.

2022
01:59:05,400 --> 01:59:06,580
I'm not going.

2023
01:59:07,660 --> 01:59:09,560
Like, She went to bed.

2024
01:59:10,320 --> 01:59:12,800
She went to bed.

2025
01:59:12,820 --> 01:59:28,420
to into the grudge house oh no oh no not kusha i would most
certainly be sent to the gulags uh what about the us they're

2026
01:59:28,420 --> 01:59:39,280
always looking for scientists yeah yeah he's done it for
years but even if i fled to the united states i would once

2027
01:59:39,280 --> 01:59:49,640
again find myself creating weapons of mass murder yeah oh
144.75 what it was on the thing where are these freaky

2028
01:59:49,640 --> 02:00:02,420
numbers you're speaking of the codec to be honest with you
i'm tired oh so beloved oh it's like the things that should

2029
02:00:02,420 --> 02:00:10,580
never be used things that should never is it called the the
nuclear bomb movie without he's like that guy oh openheimer

2030
02:00:10,580 --> 02:00:16,720
he's openheimer he's russian openheimer do not even benefit
mankind

2031
02:00:20,650 --> 02:00:34,590
this is a common theme in metal gear he's barbie he's barbie
yeah it's barbie hiber oh he just wanted to be going to

2032
02:00:34,590 --> 02:00:46,190
space the prey of politicians the space race and the arms
race are one and the same missiles rockets what's the

2033
02:00:46,190 --> 02:00:50,670
difference scientists are always being used

2034
02:00:55,610 --> 02:01:08,790
oh my god like i i didn't even if he didn't say daughter i
would not think that was like a child I don't know why the

2035
02:01:08,790 --> 02:01:19,690
picture is so messed up looking Yeah, yeah It's like an
actual cursed family Oh, vulgar Let's go, it's time Oh god,

2036
02:01:19,710 --> 02:01:27,210
he's gotta wear his mask He's ready for his lover His boy
toy Oh yeah

2037
02:01:30,760 --> 02:01:33,120
Major What are you doing here?

2038
02:01:34,020 --> 02:01:35,440
I've been waiting for you in my room

2039
02:01:42,160 --> 02:01:43,520
Oh boy!

2040
02:01:45,220 --> 02:01:46,580
Oh shit!

2041
02:01:47,440 --> 02:01:48,320
Oh again?

2042
02:01:49,700 --> 02:01:51,200
He's gotta confirm.

2043
02:01:51,700 --> 02:01:52,100
He's got it.

2044
02:01:52,580 --> 02:01:53,240
No, he got it.

2045
02:01:53,340 --> 02:01:56,360
He's very familiar with it.

2046
02:02:00,600 --> 02:02:02,580
So is he bigger or smaller?

2047
02:02:03,160 --> 02:02:03,840
Is he...

2048
02:02:03,840 --> 02:02:06,080
I know that means you.

2049
02:02:08,520 --> 02:02:11,360
Look, he took lots of pills, you know?

2050
02:02:11,580 --> 02:02:12,760
He just saw the eyes.

2051
02:02:13,140 --> 02:02:14,040
He took the...

2052
02:02:15,560 --> 02:02:19,100
You know, the opener, shake this pill, get bigger.

2053
02:02:25,860 --> 02:02:27,600
Oh, my God!

2054
02:02:28,580 --> 02:02:29,080
What?

2055
02:02:30,160 --> 02:02:31,160
Poor Sokolov.

2056
02:02:31,580 --> 02:02:32,520
Did he like what he see?

2057
02:02:33,120 --> 02:02:34,280
Like, did he...

2058
02:02:34,280 --> 02:02:35,040
What he felt?

2059
02:02:35,420 --> 02:02:36,920
Yeah, yeah, did he like what he felt?

2060
02:02:37,040 --> 02:02:39,180
Is that why they shoot the knee?

2061
02:02:42,880 --> 02:02:44,860
He's like, I don't want anyone interrupting.

2062
02:02:49,100 --> 02:02:50,280
Oh shit.

2063
02:02:51,420 --> 02:02:52,680
In the mask is so funny.

2064
02:02:54,480 --> 02:02:58,560
Yeah, I would feel like it's not good for freezing.

2065
02:03:03,680 --> 02:03:05,740
What if he's by?

2066
02:03:07,600 --> 02:03:09,740
Whoa, can she call him that?

2067
02:03:09,740 --> 02:03:10,080
What if?

2068
02:03:12,060 --> 02:03:13,980
Can she call him that?

2069
02:03:15,820 --> 02:03:16,900
Stay out of this.

2070
02:03:19,200 --> 02:03:20,360
She's so awesome.

2071
02:03:20,560 --> 02:03:22,640
She just took down every man in this room.

2072
02:03:24,100 --> 02:03:26,480
Well, to be fair, this guy was not much of a challenge.

2073
02:03:26,660 --> 02:03:27,820
You got his knees shot.

2074
02:03:28,820 --> 02:03:30,900
I see why they call you the boss.

2075
02:03:32,440 --> 02:03:33,040
What was that?

2076
02:03:33,160 --> 02:03:34,060
You're so cool.

2077
02:03:35,100 --> 02:03:36,560
No, it's CQC.

2078
02:03:37,040 --> 02:03:39,020
Basic form of close quarters combat.

2079
02:03:40,460 --> 02:03:43,100
He and I developed it together.

2080
02:03:44,780 --> 02:03:45,420
Splendid.

2081
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:47,200
Splendid.

2082
02:03:47,200 --> 02:03:48,720

2083
02:03:48,860 --> 02:03:49,660
Oh shit.

2084
02:03:50,500 --> 02:03:52,380
Are you going to kill him?

2085
02:03:53,660 --> 02:03:54,880
I don't like this part.

2086
02:03:54,960 --> 02:03:55,340
Of course.

2087
02:03:56,300 --> 02:03:58,320
But first...

2088
02:03:58,840 --> 02:03:59,220
What?

2089
02:03:59,320 --> 02:04:02,500
I will make him pay for hurting Ivan.

2090
02:04:02,680 --> 02:04:03,460
Oh no!

2091
02:04:03,880 --> 02:04:04,520

Oh!

2093
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:10,160
You hurt his lover and stripped him of his clothes.

2094
02:04:10,280 --> 02:04:13,680
Oh, he's like, only I could see him naked.

2095
02:04:14,920 --> 02:04:18,260
Yeah, he's like, how dare you touch him?

2096
02:04:20,160 --> 02:04:22,480
Did you see his lightning bolt tidy whitties?

2097
02:04:23,740 --> 02:04:25,920
Those beetles were for me.

2098
02:04:27,220 --> 02:04:27,820
Oh, my God.

2099
02:04:27,940 --> 02:04:29,420
I saw just hanging outside.

2100
02:04:31,140 --> 02:04:33,240
We're hurting his little poopy bear.

2101
02:04:41,340 --> 02:04:42,000

No, no, it's a punch!

2107
02:05:38,970 --> 02:05:40,290
It's a jaw punch!

2108
02:05:48,840 --> 02:05:50,340
Oh my god, there's so much blood.

2109
02:05:50,540 --> 02:05:51,840
Wait, whose blood is it?

2110
02:05:52,660 --> 02:05:54,980
I'm pretty sure it's Snake's blood.

2111
02:05:57,280 --> 02:05:59,380
That's a concussion right there.

2112
02:06:00,040 --> 02:06:00,620
Oh yeah.

2113
02:06:00,620 --> 02:06:09,500

Who is Khrushchev's lapdog?

02:06:30,220 --> 02:06:31,820
Oh, is he beating up the scientists?

2118
02:06:32,620 --> 02:06:34,220
He's beating up Sokolov.

2119
02:06:34,660 --> 02:06:35,060
Yeah.

2120
02:06:43,190 --> 02:06:45,690
Oh, it's so wet.

2121
02:06:46,370 --> 02:06:47,750
Oh, okay.

2122
02:06:47,750 --> 02:06:48,890
I think he's dead.

2123
02:06:50,430 --> 02:06:53,050
Oh, that sounds like a dead body.

2124
02:06:55,110 --> 02:06:56,550
I guess he's dead.

2125
02:06:59,370 --> 02:07:00,730
No way.

2126
02:07:00,730 --> 02:07:01,870
No way.

2127
02:07:02,330 --> 02:07:02,790
Really?

2128
02:07:04,450 --> 02:07:06,130
You gotta make sure you're right.

2129
02:07:06,270 --> 02:07:07,230
It's the double tap.

2130
02:07:11,310 --> 02:07:14,370
This is like a PSA that nerds aren't welcome.

2131
02:07:15,550 --> 02:07:20,690
I hope you'll prove more entertaining than he was.

2132
02:07:23,170 --> 02:07:27,550
But first, let's take a look at your body, shall we?

2133
02:07:28,870 --> 02:07:29,550
Whoa.

2134
02:07:32,050 --> 02:07:34,870
You've certainly seen your share of battles.

2135
02:07:37,590 --> 02:07:38,910
It's like actual ASMR.

2136
02:07:40,950 --> 02:07:43,430
Close your eyes and just listen to my voice.

2137
02:07:44,950 --> 02:07:47,450
Well then, let's get started.

02:07:54,530 --> 02:07:57,170

02:08:41,750 --> 02:08:42,610
Is that what you see?

2153
02:08:42,950 --> 02:08:46,370
Yes, he is watching very intently.

2154
02:08:52,880 --> 02:08:53,840
Oh, shit.

2155
02:08:57,100 --> 02:08:58,240

2161
02:10:04,570 --> 02:10:11,110
peeing himself and then he gets shot because that goes
through his pee-pee I mean, he's already covered in water.

2162
02:10:11,330 --> 02:10:15,390
Oh, that is true Yeah, but then it's going straight to the
hole

2163
02:10:24,270 --> 02:10:35,630
That's why I'm saying that got hurt that's even more painful
And you're looking for a record of where all that money is

2164
02:10:35,630 --> 02:10:36,510
hidden, right?

2165
02:10:39,790 --> 02:10:41,770
It's going up the hall!

2166
02:10:43,410 --> 02:10:44,990
That that's torture.

2167
02:10:47,410 --> 02:10:50,290
In the underground vault of the honeycrap.

2168
02:10:50,730 --> 02:10:51,990
Oh, that's... Oh, nice.

2169
02:10:52,410 --> 02:10:55,010
Everybody now knows where he actually just...

2170
02:10:55,670 --> 02:10:59,010
He's like, you're not gonna talk while I'll tell you.

2171
02:11:00,350 --> 02:11:01,510
There's a spy among us.

2172
02:11:01,670 --> 02:11:02,910
Also, by the way, the thing that you're...

2173
02:11:02,930 --> 02:11:17,090
looking for he's like you know if nobody's gonna tell it me
I'm gonna tell myself who's responsible for this oh not me

2174
02:11:17,090 --> 02:11:31,630
not me oh I planted it on him to keep track of his movements
why so the Cobras could ambush him if they knew where he was

2175
02:11:31,630 --> 02:11:40,310
gonna be they wouldn't have he's like now i can kill yeah
but it's because he knows cqc boss but under the

2176
02:11:40,310 --> 02:11:48,090
circumstances i'm afraid i must ask you to show me some
proof that you and he were not in collusion you don't trust

2177
02:11:48,090 --> 02:11:58,050
me is that it not that oh she's lost her men your apprentice
what do you want me to do kill him let's see

2178
02:12:04,350 --> 02:12:07,110
Is that why he has an eye patch?

2179
02:12:08,330 --> 02:12:09,370
Yeah, baby.

2180
02:12:10,970 --> 02:12:13,570
There's nothing more important to a soldier than his eyes.

2181
02:12:14,230 --> 02:12:15,490
You made him a soldier.

2182
02:12:15,870 --> 02:12:17,470
And now you will unmake him.

2183
02:12:18,390 --> 02:12:18,410
Yes.

2184
02:12:18,910 --> 02:12:20,350
It'll make for a touching display.

2185
02:12:21,070 --> 02:12:22,810
But he looks so badass, though.

2186
02:12:23,130 --> 02:12:24,210
He's all yours.

2187
02:12:24,510 --> 02:12:25,750
Yeah, but the depth perception.

2188
02:12:29,070 --> 02:12:30,250
But she's like, don't do it.

2189
02:12:31,130 --> 02:12:32,290
To meet that eye.

2190
02:12:32,590 --> 02:12:33,170
Drew and him.

2191
02:12:34,390 --> 02:12:36,150
Aw, the cope was.

2192
02:12:36,370 --> 02:12:37,050
I missed him.

2193
02:12:38,210 --> 02:12:40,450
It died pretty fast.

2194
02:12:41,650 --> 02:12:43,130
He has no more Pokemens.

2195
02:12:45,090 --> 02:12:46,270
Ooh, this is Elite 4.

2196
02:12:46,450 --> 02:12:47,270
Don't underestimate.

2197
02:12:47,850 --> 02:12:48,470
Mommy, please.

2198
02:12:51,370 --> 02:12:53,570
Mommy, why are you getting near me?

2199
02:12:56,990 --> 02:12:57,630
Oh.

2200
02:12:58,350 --> 02:13:01,090
Was he listening to, like, a fucking song?

2201
02:13:01,110 --> 02:13:04,570
What do you mean?

2202
02:13:04,690 --> 02:13:05,430
That's the Kodak.

2203
02:13:06,030 --> 02:13:06,590
Oh, that's the Kodak.

2204
02:13:06,830 --> 02:13:09,770
Okay, I was going to say it's jamming out right now while
getting tortured.

2205
02:13:10,970 --> 02:13:14,310
He has air condition and listening to his favorite song.

2206
02:13:14,430 --> 02:13:14,970
He's okay.

2207
02:13:17,210 --> 02:13:18,630
What is it, Tanya?

2208
02:13:20,030 --> 02:13:21,390
He suffered enough.

2209
02:13:22,270 --> 02:13:23,270
Well, well.

2210
02:13:24,070 --> 02:13:24,670
Oh.

2211
02:13:25,070 --> 02:13:26,010
He knows.

2212
02:13:26,530 --> 02:13:26,970
Yeah.

2213
02:13:30,700 --> 02:13:31,010
Oh.

2214
02:13:31,110 --> 02:13:33,550
He smells mad on her.

2215
02:13:33,570 --> 02:13:34,170
That smell.

2216
02:13:35,250 --> 02:13:36,210
That smelly smell.

2217
02:13:36,930 --> 02:13:38,850
Smelly smell that smells.

2218
02:13:38,870 --> 02:13:39,290
Smelly.

2219
02:13:40,940 --> 02:13:41,970
You're the spy.

2220
02:13:43,050 --> 02:13:43,770
That done.

2221
02:13:45,410 --> 02:13:46,910
You're the monster.

2222
02:13:47,750 --> 02:13:48,570
Like she's so...

2223
02:13:48,570 --> 02:13:50,070
Yeah, that's so suspicious.

2224
02:13:50,430 --> 02:13:50,930
I know.

2225
02:13:53,090 --> 02:13:53,670
Gay.

2226
02:13:54,650 --> 02:13:55,930
Oh, what?

2227
02:13:56,110 --> 02:13:56,930
Stop it.

2228
02:13:57,150 --> 02:13:58,450
Take attention to her.

2229
02:14:01,110 --> 02:14:02,390
He's like, yeah.

2230
02:14:02,830 --> 02:14:03,010
Me too.

2231
02:14:04,170 --> 02:14:04,850
What?

2232
02:14:06,210 --> 02:14:07,570
I want to test her.

2233
02:14:09,270 --> 02:14:10,430
Bro, look at her.

2234
02:14:12,090 --> 02:14:14,510
He has interest in one thing only.

2235
02:14:14,890 --> 02:14:15,610
That's true.

2236
02:14:16,610 --> 02:14:16,770
Do

2237
02:14:20,540 --> 02:14:24,380
we forget about cutting Snake's eyes out?

2238
02:14:26,140 --> 02:14:27,600
There's more pressing matters.

2239
02:14:31,600 --> 02:14:33,380
He's got to make everything a show.

2240
02:14:45,230 --> 02:14:46,510
Oh, shit.

2241
02:14:47,170 --> 02:14:49,630
Oh, my God.

2242
02:14:49,850 --> 02:14:53,410
There is no way his entire eye blocked the bullet.

2243
02:14:54,030 --> 02:14:55,410
A revolver's bullet.

2244
02:14:56,070 --> 02:14:59,230
That should be, like, in his fucking brain.

2245
02:15:00,630 --> 02:15:00,650
Come.

2246
02:15:01,090 --> 02:15:01,910
We're going to my room.

2247
02:15:03,310 --> 02:15:05,290
He's like, I'm all excited now.

2248
02:15:07,070 --> 02:15:07,990
Oh, yeah.

2249
02:15:08,110 --> 02:15:09,830
He's like, go get into my room.

2250
02:15:15,550 --> 02:15:16,350
Oh.

2251
02:15:17,950 --> 02:15:18,750
Oh.

2252
02:15:19,850 --> 02:15:22,610
So you survive the colonel's torture, eh?

2253
02:15:22,990 --> 02:15:25,470
Oh my god, he's so impressed.

2254
02:15:25,870 --> 02:15:26,470
He's so...

2255
02:15:27,250 --> 02:15:32,390
Watching this has made me realize something.

2256
02:15:32,990 --> 02:15:34,430
I have a torture kink.

2257
02:15:38,350 --> 02:15:40,890
It's the ultimate form of expression.

2258
02:15:42,290 --> 02:15:43,570
Oh my god, he's so insane.

2259
02:15:43,830 --> 02:15:44,250
Oh my god.

2260
02:15:44,770 --> 02:15:46,790
Oh, it's a muzzle flash that got the eye.

2261
02:15:47,090 --> 02:15:50,970
Okay, I was going to say, there's no way that eyes, those
eyes are made of steel.

2262
02:15:51,010 --> 02:15:52,470
You're lucky this time, Tatiana.

2263
02:15:52,970 --> 02:15:54,930
Nah, he's just built different.

2264
02:15:57,510 --> 02:15:58,770
She's such a good actress.

2265
02:15:59,990 --> 02:16:01,950
I mean, that would probably be actually.

2266
02:16:03,050 --> 02:16:04,790
You know, actual fear.

2267
02:16:05,350 --> 02:16:05,750
Yeah.

2268
02:16:06,490 --> 02:16:08,030
There might be a sense of that.

2269
02:16:08,170 --> 02:16:09,570
I was going to be like, damn, she's good.

2270
02:16:10,550 --> 02:16:11,790
I was going to be like, damn, she's good.

2271
02:16:19,370 --> 02:16:20,010
Oh!

2272
02:16:21,730 --> 02:16:22,210
Did he...

2273
02:16:22,210 --> 02:16:23,990
Oh, I thought it was the dick.

2274
02:16:26,650 --> 02:16:27,290
R1.

2275
02:16:27,850 --> 02:16:28,030

02:16:32,750 --> 02:16:33,270
144.

2278
02:16:34,730 --> 02:16:35,670
Oh, 144.

2279
02:16:36,910 --> 02:16:38,390
What the fuck was that?

2280
02:16:38,490 --> 02:16:39,670
Was that a ghost?

2281
02:16:40,610 --> 02:16:41,070
Hmm.

2282
02:16:46,630 --> 02:16:48,630
I've prepared an escape route for us.

2283
02:16:48,970 --> 02:16:49,970
Go out and head west.

2284
02:16:51,370 --> 02:16:53,210
Pass underneath The connecting passageway.

2285
02:16:53,370 --> 02:16:55,530

2286
02:16:55,670 --> 02:16:55,830

You're quiet!

2289
02:17:03,350 --> 02:17:04,910
The sewers are unlocked.

2290
02:17:05,330 --> 02:17:07,070
You can use it to get outside the fortress.

2291
02:17:08,070 --> 02:17:08,950

It's fine.

2307
02:18:35,880 --> 02:18:42,800
Basically, so there's a transmitter that the one that Ocelot
put in and if you keep it in, you get a special cutscene but

2308
02:18:42,800 --> 02:18:43,220

2309
02:18:44,180 --> 02:18:45,560
What did I do?

02:18:46,480 --> 02:18:46,980
You took it out.

02:18:47,180 --> 02:18:47,720
That's okay though.

2312
02:18:47,880 --> 02:18:48,300

02:18:49,360 --> 02:18:49,420

2323
02:19:04,260 --> 02:19:04,840

2325
02:19:06,740 --> 02:19:07,280
Okay, okay.

2326
02:19:08,600 --> 02:19:09,700
Hey, let me have my gun.

2327
02:19:10,280 --> 02:19:10,710
All right.

2328
02:19:13,900 --> 02:19:14,520
Eat that.

2329
02:19:14,520 --> 02:19:15,520

Yeah.

2333
02:19:18,860 --> 02:19:21,360
So there's a couple fun things you can do in here.

2334
02:19:21,740 --> 02:19:22,080
Yeah.

2335
02:19:22,900 --> 02:19:23,400

02:19:25,060 --> 02:19:25,560
Yeah.

2337
02:19:26,100 --> 02:19:28,800
So I don't cure myself, basically, right?

2338
02:19:29,420 --> 02:19:30,500
You can cure.

2339
02:19:30,700 --> 02:19:31,800
Just don't take out the transmitter.

2340
02:19:32,760 --> 02:19:33,740
So you can cure your leg.

2341
02:19:33,920 --> 02:19:34,680
Oh, this.

2342
02:19:34,960 --> 02:19:36,300
Oh, okay.

02:19:36,320 --> 02:19:37,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2344
02:19:37,760 --> 02:19:39,020
I mean, how do I cure this?

2345
02:19:39,060 --> 02:19:41,020
Do I get my fork on it?

2346
02:19:42,940 --> 02:19:43,420
Yes.

2347
02:19:44,940 --> 02:19:46,440
Oh, I see.

2348
02:19:46,460 --> 02:19:47,800
And then just leave the transmitter.

2349
02:19:48,600 --> 02:19:50,020
It's a little fun extra thing.

2350
02:19:50,860 --> 02:19:51,360
All right.

2351
02:19:56,160 --> 02:19:57,560
What do I do here?

2352
02:19:59,360 --> 02:20:00,760
Am I stuck here?

2353
02:20:01,160 --> 02:20:03,280
You haven't codecked anybody at all this one time.

2354
02:20:03,580 --> 02:20:04,180

2355

Snake, have you ever heard of Renfield?

Is that a movie?

2385
02:22:18,510 --> 02:22:19,770
It's the name of a character.

2386
02:22:20,170 --> 02:22:25,310
He's locked up in a cell waiting for the master to return,
eating the spiders that crawl along the walls.

2387
02:22:25,830 --> 02:22:26,890
Change the channel.

2388
02:22:27,890 --> 02:22:29,910
Let's change the channel.

2389
02:22:31,670 --> 02:22:33,270
Why are you so good at that?

2390
02:22:33,970 --> 02:22:35,110
Change the channel.

02:22:35,730 --> 02:22:37,670
Change the channel.

2392
02:22:38,530 --> 02:22:39,170
Paramedic.

2393

Hold on, this is the important part.

2397
02:22:51,930 --> 02:22:55,950
If you stay there too long, your old buddy Dracula is going
to come and get you too.

2398
02:22:56,130 --> 02:22:57,010

Oh, I had to change the source.

2412
02:24:08,650 --> 02:24:10,110
Apparently it's a whole new different thing.

2413
02:24:10,550 --> 02:24:12,310
Yeah, it opens up like a new window.

2414

Oh, it's called Night...

Is it Nightmare?

2416
02:24:16,130 --> 02:24:17,670
Yeah, because they're having a nightmare.

Yeah.

02:24:23,750 --> 02:24:24,830
Oh, so they were planning...

02:29:03,480 --> 02:29:04,060
Oh, yeah.

2484
02:29:04,060 --> 02:29:07,080
I make sure that flies didn't lay eggs on his, like, in his
arms.

2485
02:29:07,920 --> 02:29:08,900
That's what larvae is.

2486
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,800
You know, like, if you don't, like, um...

2487
02:29:11,800 --> 02:29:14,960
Stitch up the wounds and there's flies there, it'll lay eggs
in it.

2488
02:29:15,220 --> 02:29:15,660
Ew!

2489
02:29:16,120 --> 02:29:16,480
Yeah.

2490
02:29:17,540 --> 02:29:19,800
That's why you gotta put a band-aid on.

2491
02:29:22,220 --> 02:29:22,680
Kedokie.

2492
02:29:22,880 --> 02:29:23,860

That's true.

2494
02:29:26,760 --> 02:29:29,460
That's why you can't have gaping holes, a snake.

2495
02:29:29,760 --> 02:29:33,140
I mean, I think there's other reasons why you shouldn't have
gaping holes on you.

2496
02:29:33,440 --> 02:29:35,200
I think that does, I guess.

2497
02:29:35,300 --> 02:29:36,740
I guess that does.

2498
02:29:38,040 --> 02:29:39,700

2583
02:38:04,450 --> 02:38:05,650
Oh, the guy has a name?

2584
02:38:05,750 --> 02:38:09,030
Oh, what about the other fucking 80 guards I killed?

2585
02:38:09,170 --> 02:38:11,170
Oh, you care about Johnny.

2586
02:38:15,050 --> 02:38:16,290
Is she real?

2587
02:38:17,110 --> 02:38:18,970
Is this like Kojima's like little...

2588
02:38:22,460 --> 02:38:23,620
Little shout-outs?

2589
02:38:23,720 --> 02:38:26,960

2590
02:38:30,080 --> 02:38:31,280
Wait, where do I go?

2591
02:38:34,260 --> 02:38:35,080
Okay, this way.

2592
02:38:37,020 --> 02:38:37,420
Wait.

2593
02:38:38,980 --> 02:38:40,140
Wait, is it this way?

2594
02:38:41,840 --> 02:38:42,540
It is.

2595
02:38:43,800 --> 02:38:44,080
Oh.

2596
02:38:48,100 --> 02:38:49,820
I don't think he sees me.

2597
02:38:56,210 --> 02:38:56,930
Oh, shit!

2598
02:38:57,710 --> 02:38:58,590
Oh, fuck!

2599
02:38:58,690 --> 02:38:59,750
I thought I could see you.

2600
02:38:59,890 --> 02:39:00,590
You see what I was for!

2601
02:39:00,910 --> 02:39:02,510
I really thought I could see you.

2602
02:39:04,090 --> 02:39:04,910
I'm sorry.

2603
02:39:08,430 --> 02:39:13,070
Alright, so apparently you cannot CQC with forks.

2604
02:39:13,610 --> 02:39:15,190
I now know that.

2605
02:39:16,330 --> 02:39:17,630
I am now aware.

2606
02:39:18,730 --> 02:39:19,230
It's okay.

2607
02:39:19,430 --> 02:39:20,150
What are you gonna do?

2608
02:39:20,310 --> 02:39:20,630
Oh!

2609
02:39:26,100 --> 02:39:26,900
It's okay.

2610
02:39:27,600 --> 02:39:28,200
Alright.

2611
02:39:35,630 --> 02:39:36,450
Oh, wait.

2612
02:39:36,550 --> 02:39:37,190
That's a natural.

2613
02:39:37,830 --> 02:39:38,730
That doesn't work.

2614
02:39:39,090 --> 02:39:39,690
Oh, okay.

2615
02:39:39,690 --> 02:39:39,890
It's okay.

2616
02:39:39,930 --> 02:39:40,710
I'll just keep running.

2617
02:39:41,070 --> 02:39:42,410
I can run through this.

2618
02:39:43,930 --> 02:39:45,470
I can serpentine this.

2619
02:39:45,670 --> 02:39:46,290
Oh, shit.

2620
02:39:46,670 --> 02:39:47,230
That's okay.

2621
02:39:47,470 --> 02:39:48,110
That's okay.

2622
02:39:48,170 --> 02:39:48,950
I can keep running.

2623
02:39:51,210 --> 02:39:52,090
I made it.

2624
02:39:56,670 --> 02:39:57,070
Okay.

2625
02:39:57,650 --> 02:39:58,330
Now, where do I go?

2626
02:39:58,430 --> 02:40:00,050
Okay, I go left.

2627
02:40:00,790 --> 02:40:01,250
Where do I go?

2628
02:40:01,430 --> 02:40:02,450
Oh, I go there.

2629
02:40:02,990 --> 02:40:04,170
And then, okay, I can...

2630
02:40:04,170 --> 02:40:04,710
I'll make it.

2631
02:40:09,840 --> 02:40:10,660
Wait, is it?

2632
02:40:10,740 --> 02:40:11,240
Is it here?

2633
02:40:12,060 --> 02:40:12,540
Oh, my God.

2634
02:40:12,640 --> 02:40:13,220
It's over here.

2635
02:40:14,780 --> 02:40:15,560

I can still make it, guys!

2639
02:40:21,280 --> 02:40:22,900
They can't shoot forever!

2640
02:40:25,460 --> 02:40:26,300
What happened?

2641
02:40:26,920 --> 02:40:29,080
You catch CQC with a fork!

2642
02:40:35,500 --> 02:40:37,580
Why didn't you tell me that...

2643
02:40:37,580 --> 02:40:38,860
Oh my god, I used to rock.

2644
02:40:39,240 --> 02:40:40,980
Why didn't you tell me that CQC...

2645
02:40:40,980 --> 02:40:42,460
Wait, did you just take out the transmitter?

2646
02:40:42,800 --> 02:40:43,820
No, no, no, no.

2647
02:40:44,240 --> 02:40:45,180
I got cut.

2648
02:40:46,680 --> 02:40:47,040
Okay.

2649
02:40:47,360 --> 02:40:47,580

Oh, my God.

02:40:51,480 --> 02:40:52,780
It's a deep cut, too.

2655
02:40:53,780 --> 02:40:54,460
Uh, disinfect.

2659
02:41:06,710 --> 02:41:07,870
She killed Johnny.

2660
02:41:08,010 --> 02:41:09,290
I told you guys that she would.

2661
02:41:11,010 --> 02:41:12,770
Told you he didn't stand a chance.

2662
02:41:13,130 --> 02:41:13,810
Watch this.

2663
02:41:14,890 --> 02:41:15,950
What are you doing?

2664
02:41:18,270 --> 02:41:19,870
Do you think they know?

2665
02:41:20,430 --> 02:41:21,390

Let me guess.

2716
02:44:30,710 --> 02:44:31,570
There's a problem.

2717
02:44:31,890 --> 02:44:32,430
What problem?

2718
02:44:32,630 --> 02:44:33,250
I'm alive.

02:44:33,510 --> 02:44:34,370
What is it this time?

2720
02:44:35,030 --> 02:44:36,490
The Colonel found out you escaped.

2721
02:44:36,910 --> 02:44:37,790
He did, huh?

2722
02:44:38,210 --> 02:44:39,250
I figured as much.

2723
02:44:39,690 --> 02:44:39,770
Yeah.

2724
02:44:40,110 --> 02:44:41,130
I wonder how.

2725
02:44:41,410 --> 02:44:43,030
I wonder how he figured.

2726
02:44:43,450 --> 02:44:46,730
How did he know he got out?

2727
02:44:47,650 --> 02:44:50,190

02:44:51,190 --> 02:44:53,410
Just a couple of dogs found out.

03:01:27,580 --> 03:01:29,060
They're in a better place now.

2923
03:01:29,340 --> 03:01:30,500
How is this bad?

2924
03:01:35,340 --> 03:01:38,000
I did it for America.

2925
03:01:39,960 --> 03:01:41,460
Not for honor.

2926
03:01:42,360 --> 03:01:42,740
Oh, God.

2927
03:01:42,760 --> 03:01:43,060
Oh, God.

2928
03:01:43,420 --> 03:01:44,080
Wait, your health.

2929
03:01:44,160 --> 03:01:45,180
Wait, your health for real.

2930
03:01:45,300 --> 03:01:46,540
Are you going to actually die?

2931
03:01:46,740 --> 03:01:46,880
Oh, God.

2932
03:01:46,880 --> 03:01:47,020
Oh, God.

Like, how come I can't shoot him?

2944
03:02:12,540 --> 03:02:14,500
The ghosts.

You're killing them again?

2957
03:03:46,510 --> 03:03:48,230
You haven't learned your lesson.

2958
03:03:49,290 --> 03:03:50,510
Oh my god.

2959
03:03:51,930 --> 03:03:54,130

We're figuring it out.

2965
03:04:07,750 --> 03:04:09,130
I'd never punish!

2966
03:04:11,030 --> 03:04:13,370
As long as Doki can have a gun.

2967
03:04:13,830 --> 03:04:14,170
Never punish.

2968
03:04:14,770 --> 03:04:15,690
Never punish.

2969
03:04:16,690 --> 03:04:18,850
I feel so safe now.

2970
03:04:23,950 --> 03:04:25,310
I still...

2971
03:04:25,310 --> 03:04:27,150
I never learned my lesson.

2972
03:04:27,150 --> 03:04:29,370
This is the spirit of America!

2973
03:04:31,550 --> 03:04:32,230
USA.

2974
03:04:32,990 --> 03:04:33,670

2982
03:05:01,380 --> 03:05:02,640
He's sleeping.

2983
03:05:03,640 --> 03:05:05,780

03:07:16,560 --> 03:07:20,800
One bullet Oh, oh, oh, oh.

3017
03:07:20,800 --> 03:07:21,540
There we go.

3018
03:07:22,080 --> 03:07:23,060
Just keep going.

3019
03:07:24,560 --> 03:07:25,120
Yeah, just keep.

3020
03:07:25,180 --> 03:07:26,220
Why do you have to fight?

3021
03:07:26,560 --> 03:07:26,980
Why the fuck?

3022
03:07:27,360 --> 03:07:28,300

It's okay.

3025
03:07:30,140 --> 03:07:30,860
He deserves that one.

3026
03:07:31,100 --> 03:07:32,060
He didn't make it.

3027
03:07:32,160 --> 03:07:32,680
He didn't make it.

3028
03:07:32,820 --> 03:07:33,300
He didn't make it.

3029
03:07:33,340 --> 03:07:34,340
He didn't make it.

3030
03:07:34,560 --> 03:07:39,560
All right, here we go.

3031
03:07:41,380 --> 03:07:42,040
There we go.

3032
03:07:42,300 --> 03:07:43,220
We did it, guys.

3033
03:07:44,880 --> 03:07:45,540
Look at that.

3034
03:07:47,680 --> 03:07:48,480
Never punished.

3035
03:07:51,180 --> 03:07:52,860
You might want to leave.

3036
03:07:53,080 --> 03:07:53,820
You might want to get out.

3037
03:07:54,340 --> 03:07:55,100
How do I leave?

3038
03:07:57,900 --> 03:07:59,040
That's what I'm trying to do.

3039
03:08:00,060 --> 03:08:00,740
How do I leave?

3040
03:08:01,180 --> 03:08:04,740
Look at the body he's over.

3041
03:08:04,960 --> 03:08:05,240
Oh, here?

3042
03:08:06,560 --> 03:08:07,200
Oh, oh.

3043
03:08:08,000 --> 03:08:09,300
Oh, oh, wait.

3044
03:08:09,940 --> 03:08:10,700
Oh, dude.

3045
03:08:14,770 --> 03:08:15,210
Alright.

3046
03:08:21,780 --> 03:08:23,100
You can do this.

3047
03:08:23,160 --> 03:08:24,040
You can do this, Doki.

3048
03:08:24,380 --> 03:08:25,040
You can do this.

3049
03:08:25,680 --> 03:08:26,720
You can do this.

3050
03:08:59,880 --> 03:09:01,020
Take a look.

3051
03:09:01,160 --> 03:09:03,080
Maybe there's something in your items that could help you.

3052
03:09:03,420 --> 03:09:03,820
Besides a guide.

3053
03:09:05,320 --> 03:09:06,580
Besides a guide.

3054
03:09:07,020 --> 03:09:07,980
Besides a guide.

3055
03:09:09,000 --> 03:09:11,080
Take a look at all your items and your weapons.

3056
03:09:11,360 --> 03:09:12,620
Everything that you have.

3057
03:09:16,760 --> 03:09:18,580
That equips a different gun.

3058
03:09:21,880 --> 03:09:22,400
Check.

3059
03:09:22,420 --> 03:09:24,420
Take a look at what items you got, too.

3060
03:09:26,080 --> 03:09:26,980
I don't know.

3061
03:09:27,000 --> 03:09:27,780
Not just your weapons.

3062
03:09:27,980 --> 03:09:28,840
There are other items, too.

3063
03:09:29,400 --> 03:09:29,900
My book?

3064
03:09:30,040 --> 03:09:30,360
Items.

3065
03:09:30,440 --> 03:09:31,180
You're on weapons.

3066
03:09:31,360 --> 03:09:32,080
You're on weapons.

3067
03:09:32,220 --> 03:09:33,080
Oh, oh, oh.

3068
03:09:33,380 --> 03:09:33,780
Go back.

3069
03:09:34,240 --> 03:09:34,900
There you go.

3070
03:09:35,400 --> 03:09:36,420
See what else you got.

3071
03:09:49,570 --> 03:09:50,370
I did.

3072
03:09:54,010 --> 03:09:54,410
What?

3073
03:10:02,280 --> 03:10:10,090
I can't even take What's the point?

3074
03:10:11,070 --> 03:10:11,070
What

3075
03:10:14,160 --> 03:10:21,000
do you think you're doing?

3076
03:10:21,820 --> 03:10:24,820
These are the creatures you have killed

3077
03:10:32,590 --> 03:10:35,670
You can figure out the rest, Doki

3078
03:10:39,830 --> 03:10:41,230
No!

3079
03:10:45,030 --> 03:10:45,170
No!

3080
03:10:49,130 --> 03:10:49,550
No!

3081
03:10:51,770 --> 03:10:54,710
I worked so hard!

3082
03:10:56,630 --> 03:10:59,890
I made it so far!

3083
03:11:02,710 --> 03:11:04,110
No!

3084
03:11:06,410 --> 03:11:06,930
Excellent.

3085
03:11:10,810 --> 03:11:12,630
I don't understand!

3086
03:11:16,790 --> 03:11:21,350
Why wouldn't my crocodiles scare away the ghosts?

3087
03:11:25,130 --> 03:11:25,910
Oh no, it's gonna hit.

3088
03:11:26,150 --> 03:11:27,270
Ghosts love crocodiles.

3089
03:11:28,610 --> 03:11:28,790
Okay.

3090
03:11:29,950 --> 03:11:30,190
Okay.

3091
03:11:30,450 --> 03:11:32,090
You're getting your life sucked.

3092
03:11:32,430 --> 03:11:33,030
Oh my god.

3093
03:11:33,530 --> 03:11:35,970

This is definitely...

3160
03:17:21,160 --> 03:17:23,320
Since you said that, this is not the run.

3161
03:17:23,500 --> 03:17:24,460
This is not the run right now.

3162
03:17:24,460 --> 03:17:24,740

03:17:40,220 --> 03:17:41,900
Wait, what does the dive button do?

3173
03:17:43,240 --> 03:17:44,680
It makes you so you can swim.

3174
03:17:46,400 --> 03:17:47,720
Should I be swimming?

03:17:52,460 --> 03:17:53,920

03:20:31,860 --> 03:20:34,980
Holy shit, don't these brains work.

03:20:36,680 --> 03:20:41,760
I think you put the aha soup up.

3201
03:20:51,250 --> 03:20:51,710
Nice.

3202
03:20:52,030 --> 03:20:52,450
Nice.

3203
03:20:58,650 --> 03:21:00,150
You've just been in the water.

3204
03:21:00,170 --> 03:21:09,770
water that entire time just drowning away casually drowning
you know maybe you know a couple more brain cells have died

3205
03:21:09,770 --> 03:21:24,010
from suffocation but that's all right it's possible for him
there's nothing left it's just pure instinct now oh i had a

3206
03:21:24,010 --> 03:21:28,750
butterfly oh oh there's the ghost yeah

3207
03:21:35,170 --> 03:21:36,250
The sorrow.

3208
03:21:37,370 --> 03:21:38,490
Snake, are you all right?

3209
03:21:39,170 --> 03:21:40,070
That was a close call.

3210
03:21:40,670 --> 03:21:41,750
What the hell happened to me?

3211
03:21:42,130 --> 03:21:43,990
You were halfway drowned at the bottom of the river.

3212
03:21:44,710 --> 03:21:46,490
Almost crossed over to the other side.

3213
03:21:47,210 --> 03:21:47,870
Other side.

3214
03:21:48,030 --> 03:21:48,630
That's right.

3215
03:21:48,730 --> 03:21:50,050
Never punished.

3216
03:21:51,790 --> 03:21:57,170
That means I can kill more because there's no punishment.

3217
03:21:57,770 --> 03:21:59,130
Yeah, there's no punishment no more.

3218
03:22:00,150 --> 03:22:01,370
What kind of man was he?

3219
03:22:01,450 --> 03:22:02,390
He survived the river.

3220
03:22:03,250 --> 03:22:04,570
I survived so

3221
03:22:09,270 --> 03:22:18,050
good job you managed to avoid drowning someone who can
communicate with the spirit world and evoke the spirits of

3222
03:22:18,050 --> 03:22:26,350
the dead in other words he could talk to ghosts in the end i
learned that i could finally kill again what about him and

3223
03:22:26,350 --> 03:22:34,570
the boss what was the story between them i don't know the
details why don't we ask sigand all right i finished

3224
03:22:34,570 --> 03:22:41,590
checking up on this sorrow guy a while ago i thought you
guys already knew though knew what that he's dead he's been

3225
03:22:41,590 --> 03:22:50,070

to you know those clips you were at and the boss is the one

3226
03:22:51,430 --> 03:22:59,210
the boss two years ago the boss was sent by the cia on a
secret mission to seleno yarsk that's when she met the

3227
03:22:59,210 --> 03:23:05,390
sorrow who'd gone back to the soviet union after the cobras
broke up at the end of the war except this time they were

3228
03:23:05,390 --> 03:23:13,050
enemies and then what what happened the sorrow herself and
accomplished her mission at least that's what the records

3229
03:23:13,050 --> 03:23:22,190
say he is dead he was never there in the first place he just
couldn't ignore the boss oh he was like in love yeah it

3230
03:23:22,190 --> 03:23:29,930
looks like it's not time for me to die he hasn't moved on
otherwise the whole mission is We're counting on you, pal.

3231
03:23:30,650 --> 03:23:31,130
Roger that.

3232
03:23:31,550 --> 03:23:33,330
They said this in a...

3233
03:23:33,330 --> 03:23:34,990
I didn't spoil nothing.

3234
03:23:35,150 --> 03:23:36,970
They literally said this in a codec last time.

3235
03:23:37,110 --> 03:23:37,490
I remember.

3236
03:23:37,830 --> 03:23:37,890
Yeah.

3237
03:23:38,430 --> 03:23:40,430
I took a pretty freaky detour.

3238
03:23:41,150 --> 03:23:41,970
What are you talking about?

3239
03:23:42,570 --> 03:23:42,850
Nothing.

3240
03:23:43,210 --> 03:23:43,710
Forget it.

3241
03:23:44,310 --> 03:23:45,430
Let's just say I'm back.

3242
03:23:46,770 --> 03:23:48,430
But how did you escape from the sewers?

3243
03:23:49,050 --> 03:23:49,690
I jumped in the river.

3244
03:23:49,690 --> 03:23:51,110
They were just reiterating it.

3245
03:23:53,610 --> 03:23:57,130
Yeah, you can't actually lead Metal Gear Solid YouTuber.

3246
03:23:59,770 --> 03:24:05,210
I mean, if you ended up in the river, then I know a good
spot nearby.

3247
03:24:05,850 --> 03:24:06,570
Let's meet up there.

3248
03:24:07,170 --> 03:24:07,670
Where is it?

3249
03:24:08,250 --> 03:24:10,730
Keep going upstream until you get to a waterfall.

3250
03:24:11,830 --> 03:24:12,670
A waterfall, huh?

3251
03:24:13,310 --> 03:24:14,930
Rage bait's successful.

3252
03:24:17,150 --> 03:24:19,490
The cave behind a waterfall upstream.

3253
03:24:19,830 --> 03:24:20,930
Impossible to rage bait me.

3254
03:24:23,010 --> 03:24:23,570

03:31:47,770 --> 03:31:49,190
Yeah, you ain't a bro.

3359
03:31:49,370 --> 03:31:50,110

What?

3363
03:31:59,790 --> 03:32:02,450

03:32:04,550 --> 03:32:06,230

Let me do it.

3369
03:32:15,750 --> 03:32:17,250
Oh, it's Austin Powers.

3370
03:32:17,590 --> 03:32:19,450
Oh, I've been trying to do this kind of thing myself.

3371
03:32:19,770 --> 03:32:21,970
Just relax and let me handle it.

3372
03:32:24,610 --> 03:32:25,610
It's a restituber.

3373
03:32:26,370 --> 03:32:26,950
Yeah, I mean...

3374
03:32:26,970 --> 03:32:29,510
This is WrestleTube for 2026, guys.

We're getting it.

3376
03:32:30,550 --> 03:32:31,650
We got it.

3377
03:32:32,710 --> 03:32:34,050
What the fuck?

3378
03:32:39,260 --> 03:32:42,380
Holy shit, he stepped on her boss.

3379
03:32:45,160 --> 03:32:47,080
Oh, my god.

3380
03:32:48,360 --> 03:32:50,080
There, a transmitter.

3381
03:32:53,550 --> 03:32:54,890
Is that how they do it in the KGB?

3382
03:32:55,530 --> 03:32:56,050
Sometimes.

3383
03:32:56,410 --> 03:32:58,130
Would you rather I did it American style?

3384
03:33:01,810 --> 03:33:02,330
CBT.

3385
03:33:02,350 --> 03:33:03,150
Shut up.

3386
03:33:15,620 --> 03:33:17,400
Oh my god.

3387
03:33:18,520 --> 03:33:19,740
Yay, you got your stuff back.

3388
03:33:20,580 --> 03:33:21,680
On my clothes.

3389
03:33:22,560 --> 03:33:23,720
Oh my god, my eye patch!

3390
03:33:24,280 --> 03:33:25,040
Yeah, it looks so good.

3391
03:33:25,080 --> 03:33:26,720
That's the Metal Gear reference.

3392
03:33:28,160 --> 03:33:28,560
Yeah.

3393
03:33:28,860 --> 03:33:30,640
A highly proved explosive from the west.

3394
03:33:32,800 --> 03:33:40,020
molded into any shape like clay with just this much you
could blow up the shagohad and the lab along with it is that

3395
03:33:40,020 --> 03:33:54,860
right yeah but there's a trick to using it tell me about it
oh my guys she molding them that's a waste of material what

3396
03:33:54,860 --> 03:34:02,300
do you think oh my she used half of the material no it's
still good

3397
03:34:05,940 --> 03:34:14,980
he's like hey heart okay anyway tell me tell me the briefing
Easter unit uses liquid fuel the fuel tanks are in the main

3398
03:34:14,980 --> 03:34:21,540
wing of the weapons lab in the hangar housing the Shagohat
itself so I should blow up the tanks that's the basic idea

3399
03:34:21,540 --> 03:34:29,240
it should be enough to blow up the entire hangar what man
that's some strong-ass shit in order to destroy the hangar

3400
03:34:29,240 --> 03:34:37,220
you'll have to set explosives on each of those tanks all
four of them it should be no sweat for you oh this part's

3401
03:34:37,220 --> 03:34:43,940
not that bad okay the hangar is completely deserted not
quite they've still got guards posted there so what do i do

3402
03:34:43,940 --> 03:34:54,360
after i set the c3 the bombs run off the top also that's a
lie there are definitely guys in there oh yeah okay oh my

3403
03:34:54,360 --> 03:34:57,780
actually time 20 minutes oh okay 20 That's fine.

3404
03:34:59,640 --> 03:35:00,680
Uh, yeah.

3405
03:35:04,740 --> 03:35:06,420
20 minutes, that's fine.

3406
03:35:06,640 --> 03:35:08,080
I can do this in 20 minutes.

3407
03:35:09,600 --> 03:35:09,880
Yeah.

3408
03:35:10,520 --> 03:35:10,800
Yeah.

3409
03:35:13,840 --> 03:35:15,800
That's the mission I was given.

3410
03:35:16,660 --> 03:35:17,260
By CruzeGen?

3411
03:35:18,280 --> 03:35:21,720
America doesn't have any use for it, does it?

3412
03:35:21,960 --> 03:35:24,260
But I haven't forgotten my other mission either.

3413
03:35:24,620 --> 03:35:25,240
Wait, she has the lipstick.

3414
03:35:25,520 --> 03:35:26,040
Wait.

3415
03:35:27,100 --> 03:35:29,020
Was she poisoning me?

3416
03:35:30,920 --> 03:35:33,000
She would have to poison herself too.

3417
03:35:34,520 --> 03:35:36,160
As long as she doesn't lick her lips is fine.

3418
03:35:41,800 --> 03:35:45,760
Okay, well you have to go back to Grozny Graz.

3419
03:35:45,860 --> 03:35:47,460
Go back to Grozny Graz.

3420
03:35:48,860 --> 03:35:50,260
Go to Grozny Graz.

3421
03:35:50,720 --> 03:35:57,880
When you entered the main wing from the second floor of the
east wing, yeah, that's the entrance to the the Shagohod's

3422
03:35:57,880 --> 03:35:58,240
hangar.

3423
03:36:04,000 --> 03:36:05,880
Use this key to open that door.

3424
03:36:07,800 --> 03:36:09,560
The door right when I enter the main wing.

3425
03:36:10,960 --> 03:36:11,200
Got it.

3426
03:36:12,120 --> 03:36:12,760
What about you?

3427
03:36:13,360 --> 03:36:14,900
I'll get things ready for our escape.

3428
03:36:15,000 --> 03:36:16,320
She's her getaway driving.

3429
03:36:17,960 --> 03:36:18,440
Yep.

3430
03:36:18,480 --> 03:36:21,540
I'm going to set a bomb there, so I'm taking half of the C3
with me.

3431
03:36:21,640 --> 03:36:21,880
Right.

3432
03:36:22,080 --> 03:36:23,680
I'll set off the weapons lab then.

3433
03:36:23,880 --> 03:36:24,960
She's so hot.

3434
03:36:26,320 --> 03:36:28,100
And watch out for Ocelot.

3435
03:36:28,500 --> 03:36:30,200
He suspects you're not who you say you are.

Those guys literally don't matter.

03:46:40,410 --> 03:46:42,230
They're just screaming at you out.

This locker.

This one?

3639
03:48:12,790 --> 03:48:13,930
Oh, oh, and now...

Just kidding.

03:48:14,910 --> 03:48:16,710
No, it's not that one, but...

3643
03:48:16,710 --> 03:48:17,650
That one's still good.

3644
03:48:17,830 --> 03:48:18,690
You could hide in there.

3645
03:48:18,850 --> 03:48:19,390
Wait, yeah.

3646
03:48:19,710 --> 03:48:20,050
Yeah.

3647
03:48:21,590 --> 03:48:23,390
Now, now we start to sell.

3648
03:48:30,060 --> 03:48:30,340
Oh.

3649
03:48:31,140 --> 03:48:31,940
Everything's good.

3650
03:48:33,200 --> 03:48:33,480
Yep.

3651
03:48:33,980 --> 03:48:34,240
Oh.

3652
03:48:38,280 --> 03:48:40,080
Just a nerd and a locker.

3653
03:48:41,660 --> 03:48:44,240
Wait, if the nerds see me, will they alert?

3654
03:48:45,240 --> 03:48:46,300
They scream, yeah.

3655
03:48:47,180 --> 03:48:51,780
They're really annoying because they just go, Oh, and they
alert everybody.

3656
03:48:54,220 --> 03:48:55,000
Why are you doing that?

3657
03:48:55,180 --> 03:48:55,920
They're going to hear you.

3658
03:49:00,120 --> 03:49:02,820
You're going to wait the full 80 minutes or 80 seconds.

3659
03:49:03,640 --> 03:49:04,360
Let's just leave.

3660
03:49:05,600 --> 03:49:07,440
Okay, well, okay.

3661
03:49:07,840 --> 03:49:08,980
Yeah, we can do it without it.

3662
03:49:09,480 --> 03:49:10,100
Wait, do what?

3663
03:49:11,460 --> 03:49:15,220
No, well, you have to put the bombs on the thing.

3664
03:49:23,310 --> 03:49:26,230
You just go and do things so quickly.

3665
03:49:26,810 --> 03:49:26,970
Oh.

3666
03:49:30,730 --> 03:49:31,870
But when you said...

3667
03:49:32,810 --> 03:49:35,190
When you said it's not that locker, I just...

3668
03:49:35,190 --> 03:49:36,850
Oh, okay, I guess none of the locker.

3669
03:49:38,690 --> 03:49:40,090
What do you mean?

3670
03:49:40,270 --> 03:49:41,350
None of the locker!

3671
03:49:41,870 --> 03:49:45,870
I just thought, oh, I guess that means it's none of the
lockers.

3672
03:49:47,250 --> 03:49:48,930
If it's none of the lockers.

3673
03:49:50,710 --> 03:49:52,170
You can go back.

3674
03:49:52,410 --> 03:49:52,890
You can get it.

3675
03:49:53,070 --> 03:49:53,290
Oh, yeah.

3676
03:49:53,750 --> 03:49:53,910
Yeah.

3677
03:49:55,570 --> 03:49:57,290
It's just, it just makes this a whole lot easier.

3678
03:49:58,270 --> 03:49:58,750
Agreed.

3679
03:49:59,270 --> 03:50:01,670
That leaves just one more mission for you to carry out.

3680
03:50:02,130 --> 03:50:02,750
The boss.

3681
03:50:03,030 --> 03:50:03,890
The boss.

3682
03:50:05,210 --> 03:50:05,530
Aww.

3683
03:50:05,930 --> 03:50:08,430
For now, just focus on destroying the Shagga Hood.

3684
03:50:09,050 --> 03:50:09,530
Yes, sir.

3685
03:50:10,070 --> 03:50:13,030
I'll let Sigint fill you in on how to destroy it.

3686
03:50:13,230 --> 03:50:14,150
Yeah, how do I do the thing?

3687
03:50:14,490 --> 03:50:20,010
Like Eva was saying, if you're looking to blow the whole
place sky high, the best way is to take out those liquid

3688
03:50:20,010 --> 03:50:21,410
fuel tanks with the C3.

3689
03:50:22,290 --> 03:50:23,910
You know there's four tanks in there, right?

3690
03:50:24,250 --> 03:50:26,410
You have to put C3 on all four of them.

3691
03:50:26,990 --> 03:50:33,010
To plan a C3 charge, all you gotta do is equip the C3 and
press the attack button while standing near a tank.

3692
03:50:33,430 --> 03:50:34,530
Just like TNT.

3693
03:50:34,750 --> 03:50:36,310
Ooh, it's that easy.

3694
03:50:36,490 --> 03:50:37,550
But make sure you don't plant it in the wrong place.

3695
03:50:37,730 --> 03:50:39,510
You barely got enough C3 as it is.

3696
03:50:39,530 --> 03:50:47,910
right good point i'll make sure not to plant it anywhere
else could man and be careful liquid fuel has a nasty habit

3697
03:50:47,910 --> 03:50:53,410
of going off at the slightest shock so don't go using any
heavy firepower near the tanks unless you're aiming to get

3698
03:50:53,410 --> 03:50:59,990
yourself barbecue i'll keep that in mind that doesn't sound
fun the c3 charges all have to go off at once if you want to

3699
03:50:59,990 --> 03:51:06,370
bring down the hanger in one fell swoop so if i were you i'd
wait until after you plant the last charge to start the

3700
03:51:06,370 --> 03:51:17,870
timer planting all four charges before I start the timer
okay yeah 20 minutes that's easy make sure you get your ass

3701
03:51:17,870 --> 03:51:26,350
out of that place by yeah I just had to run fast all I've
got the rest is up to you good luck pal all right I plant

3702
03:51:26,350 --> 03:51:35,930
all four bombs and then and then I do the charge I can
listen

3703
03:51:39,530 --> 03:51:51,450
listen you guys i can i can process information wait which
locker is it uh figure it out this locker is it this locker

3704
03:51:51,450 --> 03:52:07,170
oh there's food there's a passion oh is it this one is it

3705
03:52:07,170 --> 03:52:20,090

uniform that's the one so basically there's you know how

3706
03:52:20,090 --> 03:52:26,930
they were like oh yeah there's guards there's guards manning
it no not the sneaking one oh makes this yeah so they say

3707
03:52:26,930 --> 03:52:35,710
there's not there's guards but there's also janitor guys
that that act just like the scientists so yeah, like they'll

3708
03:52:35,710 --> 03:52:42,350
recognize you or they'll be they'll they'll notice you if
you get too close to them they'll be like, huh, that's not

3709
03:52:42,350 --> 03:52:45,570
that's not one of our men, but the guards, they don't notice
at all.

3710
03:52:45,770 --> 03:52:46,310
So you're okay.

3711
03:52:46,590 --> 03:52:47,870
So I can wear this right?

3712
03:52:48,290 --> 03:52:48,430
Yep.

3713
03:52:48,750 --> 03:52:50,110
Look at his ass and it too.

3715
03:52:51,070 --> 03:52:52,770
Oh, that's why you wouldn't.

3716
03:52:53,130 --> 03:52:53,490
Oh,

3717
03:52:56,750 --> 03:52:58,650
yeah, yeah, they're the janitors.

3718
03:52:59,210 --> 03:52:59,870
Look at this.

3719
03:53:00,410 --> 03:53:03,250
Oh, I mean, they're like specially molded.

3720
03:53:03,450 --> 03:53:05,450
It's like so...

3721
03:53:06,770 --> 03:53:10,650
Don't have lots of experience with this, doing this with
rivals.

3722
03:53:11,510 --> 03:53:11,530
Wow.

3723
03:53:13,030 --> 03:53:13,550

3791
03:57:53,720 --> 03:57:56,460
If we get rid of the bridge, the enemy won't be able to
follow us.

3792
03:57:57,120 --> 03:57:58,700
That should at least buy us some time.

Do you guys hear pee-pee?

That definitely wasn't there to her.

3823
04:00:01,440 --> 04:00:03,300
I'm on my way out now.

3824
04:00:04,060 --> 04:00:05,660
What a funny prank, guys.

3825
04:00:05,820 --> 04:00:06,460
Plenty fake.

3826
04:00:06,660 --> 04:00:08,300
Pretty fake C3s on these.

3827
04:00:08,600 --> 04:00:09,620
Yeah, she can handle it.

3828
04:00:09,940 --> 04:00:10,300
All right, then.

3829
04:00:10,420 --> 04:00:11,880
We'll hurry up and get out of there.

3830
04:00:12,660 --> 04:00:13,140
All right.

3831
04:00:14,320 --> 04:00:15,160
Oh, man.

3832
04:00:15,480 --> 04:00:15,840
Oh, CQC.

3833
04:00:17,000 --> 04:00:17,440
CQC?

3834
04:00:17,540 --> 04:00:17,740
What?

3835
04:00:17,820 --> 04:00:19,560
Now he gets to walk around with his gun.

3836
04:00:20,520 --> 04:00:20,700
Oh.

3837
04:00:21,480 --> 04:00:21,920
Eva!

3838
04:00:23,520 --> 04:00:25,580
Wait, I thought she was ready!

3839
04:00:27,280 --> 04:00:27,840
Uh-oh.

3840
04:00:27,940 --> 04:00:28,620
Uh-oh.

3841
04:00:30,700 --> 04:00:32,320
Hey, remember me?

3842
04:00:33,020 --> 04:00:34,160
Oh, shit, boss!

3843
04:00:35,480 --> 04:00:35,780
Mommy.

3844
04:00:36,760 --> 04:00:37,040
Mom?

3845
04:00:39,670 --> 04:00:40,930
Why'd you come back?

3846
04:00:44,360 --> 04:00:45,540
Valid question.

3847
04:00:47,000 --> 04:00:47,860
Oh, shit.

3848
04:00:49,100 --> 04:00:50,240
Oh, snake.

3849
04:00:50,520 --> 04:00:51,640
You should have...

3850
04:00:52,360 --> 04:00:53,080
Oh.

3851
04:00:57,420 --> 04:01:00,120
Damn, he breakdancing.

3852
04:01:07,380 --> 04:01:08,180
Ooh, the tension.

3853
04:01:11,800 --> 04:01:16,080
It does look like a squid game outfit.

3854
04:01:17,180 --> 04:01:18,220
That's true.

3855
04:01:19,220 --> 04:01:21,860
Oh, R1.

3856
04:01:22,280 --> 04:01:24,100
I saw it.

3857
04:01:28,810 --> 04:01:29,590
You see

3858
04:01:32,880 --> 04:01:35,520
it in that one frame?

3859
04:01:42,210 --> 04:01:43,690
Yep, I saw our eyes.

3860
04:01:43,730 --> 04:01:45,070
Yeah, we had a wide frame.

3861
04:01:45,250 --> 04:01:47,930
This woman was found snooping around my underground vault.

3862
04:01:49,450 --> 04:01:52,150
When she was captured, look what we found on her.

3863
04:01:54,630 --> 04:01:55,290
Did you see it?

3864
04:01:58,150 --> 04:01:59,430
The Philosopher's Legacy.

3865
04:02:00,170 --> 04:02:01,890
Oh my god, the Philosopher's Legacy!

3866
04:02:03,070 --> 04:02:06,030
Oh, it was like like the in the Bollywood cut, like cuts.

3867
04:02:07,290 --> 04:02:08,330
I won, I won, I won, I won!

3868
04:02:10,010 --> 04:02:11,750
Yeah, remember that 20 minutes?

3869
04:02:12,290 --> 04:02:12,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3870
04:02:12,950 --> 04:02:14,270
Bro, he looked like...

3871
04:02:15,330 --> 04:02:16,330
What's his name?

3872
04:02:16,770 --> 04:02:20,230
The guy who does, like, Avengers Cat, like, the Marvel
cameos.

3873
04:02:21,450 --> 04:02:22,290
Oh, yeah.

3874
04:02:22,670 --> 04:02:23,230
Yeah.

3875
04:02:26,870 --> 04:02:28,590
It was gasoline.

3876
04:02:29,990 --> 04:02:31,110
Motorcycle gasoline.

3877
04:02:32,270 --> 04:02:34,630
Yeah, he looked like Stan Lee for a second.

3878
04:02:35,870 --> 04:02:38,330
To think that lovely Tatiana was a spy.

3879
04:02:38,350 --> 04:02:39,910
The guy who does the Marvel cameos.

3880
04:02:40,010 --> 04:02:42,110
It was not like he was the guy who fucking like...

3881
04:02:42,110 --> 04:02:50,070
He was the guy that does the marble can of use?

3882
04:02:50,950 --> 04:02:54,110
Such a fine woman she was.

3883
04:02:54,790 --> 04:02:55,110
Damn.

3884
04:02:55,410 --> 04:02:58,070
What about Radcliffe?

3885
04:02:58,850 --> 04:02:59,450
Radcliffe.

3886
04:03:00,530 --> 04:03:00,870
What?

3887
04:03:01,170 --> 04:03:02,010
He's gonna be...

3888
04:03:02,870 --> 04:03:03,430
Raikoff!

3889
04:03:03,910 --> 04:03:04,510
Raikoff!

3890
04:03:04,730 --> 04:03:04,910
Yeah.

3891
04:03:05,550 --> 04:03:06,410
He's done.

3892
04:03:06,590 --> 04:03:06,970
That's it.

3893
04:03:07,710 --> 04:03:08,130
That's it.

3894
04:03:08,190 --> 04:03:08,490
What?

3895
04:03:10,010 --> 04:03:24,930
he doesn't show up anymore yes she was an obedient one oh
she was my precious little oh my god oh isn't that right my

3896
04:03:24,930 --> 04:03:40,570
poor princess oh what was that do you have something to say
to me oh it's the kiss of death yeah oh oh no No.

3897
04:03:41,890 --> 04:03:42,950
So close.

3898
04:03:43,150 --> 04:03:44,190
Maybe you shouldn't have said anything.

3899
04:03:46,110 --> 04:03:49,230
Maybe she shouldn't have said that.

3900
04:03:50,550 --> 04:03:51,310
Like...

3901
04:03:51,310 --> 04:03:52,070
I've had enough kisses from you.

3902
04:03:52,750 --> 04:03:52,990
Oh!

3903
04:03:55,550 --> 04:03:57,910
I've had enough kisses from you.

3904
04:03:58,790 --> 04:03:59,470
Jesus.

3905
04:04:00,290 --> 04:04:02,730
It's like my favorite line in this whole game.

3906
04:04:04,010 --> 04:04:05,390
That's your favorite.

3907
04:04:06,090 --> 04:04:06,650
Oh, shit.

3908
04:04:06,850 --> 04:04:07,230
Sadly.

3909
04:04:10,010 --> 04:04:15,470
something so beautiful yeah the timer is still going even
during the cutscene isn't that so funny like you don't have

3910
04:04:15,470 --> 04:04:24,550
20 minutes you have oh no explain it before i kill you i've
had enough kisses during the last great war oh my god all

3911
04:04:24,550 --> 04:04:32,630
right i put my controller down i'm getting a history lesson
now the pact was a blueprint for defeating the axis powers

3912
04:04:32,630 --> 04:04:42,190
and creating a new world order to secure victory in the war
the three countries pooled their resources to conduct the

3913
04:04:42,190 --> 04:04:55,510
most covert types of operations and research the atomic bomb
rocket technology the Cobra unit one might not be and they

3914
04:04:55,510 --> 04:05:02,130
amassed an enormous sum of money to fund these money money
they're explaining the war philosopher's legacy though

3915
04:05:02,130 --> 04:05:12,310
uh-huh man that wealth is the philosopher's legacy hey baby
after the war was the three countries were to divide the

3916
04:05:12,310 --> 04:05:14,250
Philosopher's Legacy amongst themselves.

3917
04:05:15,890 --> 04:05:21,670
This explains why the United States and the Soviet Union
were able to steal away the best scientific minds in Germany

3918
04:05:21,670 --> 04:05:23,090
as soon as the war ended.

3919
04:05:25,390 --> 04:05:29,330
But our great motherland has far surpassed its pathetic
rivals.

3920
04:05:31,130 --> 04:05:38,510
We possess enormous wealth, the most advanced technology,
and overwhelming power, assets fitting of our great country.

3921
04:05:41,030 --> 04:05:45,490
My father was one of the men in charge of managing the
Philosopher's Legacy.

3922
04:05:46,890 --> 04:05:52,870
In the confusion that ensued after the war ended, he devised
a series of ingenious plots to ensure that the Soviet Union

3923
04:05:52,870 --> 04:05:54,910
would have total control over the legacy.

3924
04:05:56,410 --> 04:06:00,410
The money was divided up and laundered through banks all
over the world.

3925
04:06:02,710 --> 04:06:05,470
Switzerland, Austria, and Hong Kong.

3926
04:06:05,890 --> 04:06:06,590
Oh, God!

3927
04:06:12,170 --> 04:06:14,470
Thank you, Kojumbo.

3928
04:06:15,410 --> 04:06:19,850
After my father's death, I learned of this secret and
obtained the microfilm.

3929
04:06:22,250 --> 04:06:28,870
With this money and the support of Brezhnev and his allies,
I built this fortress of Grosnygrad and Granin's research

3930
04:06:28,870 --> 04:06:29,530
facility.

3931
04:06:31,970 --> 04:06:35,790
But that worthless fool Granin failed to produce results.

3932
04:06:36,590 --> 04:06:48,800
to build mechos dog sokolov and his invention the shagohad
my physician and grew made it too troublesome to attack

3933
04:06:48,800 --> 04:06:58,460
sokolov's facility directly but the spy network established
by the secret pack still existed i used it to contact the

3934
04:06:58,460 --> 04:07:10,020
boss yeah the boss was conniving enough to see things my
Wait, was that the... Is that the boss?

3935
04:07:10,420 --> 04:07:11,160
Yeah, that's the boss.

3936
04:07:11,240 --> 04:07:11,800
Look at the eyes!

3937
04:07:11,940 --> 04:07:12,580
Look at the cutie!

3938
04:07:12,600 --> 04:07:13,060
The cripple!

3939
04:07:15,600 --> 04:07:20,780
We will use the legacy to heal that rift and make the world
whole again.

3940
04:07:23,080 --> 04:07:28,700
To do this, we need strength, an unstoppable trump card with
enough power to bring order to the world.

3941
04:07:30,480 --> 04:07:34,560
That trump card was to be the Shagohod and the Cobra Unit.

3942
04:07:43,790 --> 04:07:45,390
Do you really?

3943
04:07:47,470 --> 04:07:50,510
I still have the Shagohod and the legacy.

3944
04:07:51,410 --> 04:07:55,830

04:17:22,800 --> 04:17:23,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4121
04:17:23,560 --> 04:17:24,540
What is he doing?

4122
04:17:25,880 --> 04:17:26,840
He's recharging.

4123
04:17:27,520 --> 04:17:28,900
Oh, that's how he recharged?

4124
04:17:29,240 --> 04:17:30,000
Quiet, Ocelot.

4125
04:17:31,340 --> 04:17:32,220
That's on him.

4126
04:17:33,280 --> 04:17:33,640
Boom.

4127
04:17:35,060 --> 04:17:36,160
Oh, three now!

4128
04:17:38,300 --> 04:17:39,260
Hey, CKC!

4129
04:17:41,440 --> 04:17:43,840
Okay, there we go.

4130
04:17:44,480 --> 04:17:44,960
Wow.

4131
04:17:48,440 --> 04:17:49,560
It's that easy.

4132
04:17:50,160 --> 04:17:50,840
Phase two.

4133
04:17:53,980 --> 04:17:56,560
Okay, I do not have a lot of time left.

4134
04:17:57,220 --> 04:17:57,660
So, oh.

4135
04:17:58,140 --> 04:17:59,380
He's not even watching.

4136
04:18:00,340 --> 04:18:01,100
He's angry.

4137
04:18:01,840 --> 04:18:03,160
Oh, he's angry.

4138
04:18:04,780 --> 04:18:06,300
No talking.

4139
04:18:06,340 --> 04:18:07,040
He no talking.

4140
04:18:10,840 --> 04:18:11,880
Sorry, Colonel.

4141
04:18:12,440 --> 04:18:13,980
I'm afraid I can't do that.

4142
04:18:13,980 --> 04:18:16,180
What do you mean, you can't?

4143
04:18:17,380 --> 04:18:19,100
I made a promise to the boss.

4144
04:18:19,540 --> 04:18:20,280
Who the boss?

4145
04:18:20,880 --> 04:18:22,200
What did she ask for?

4146
04:18:22,520 --> 04:18:24,100
I am your commanding officer.

4147
04:18:25,340 --> 04:18:26,220
Oh, shit.

4148
04:18:32,460 --> 04:18:34,960
Oh, yeah, he shot every...

4149
04:18:34,960 --> 04:18:35,740
Okay, yeah.

4150
04:18:35,820 --> 04:18:36,180
Alright.

4151
04:18:37,880 --> 04:18:38,840
So funny.

4152
04:18:39,500 --> 04:18:41,620
Oh, he used up too much energy.

4153
04:18:42,100 --> 04:18:43,020
Are you questioning my authority?

4154
04:18:43,720 --> 04:18:44,480
My authority?

4155
04:18:54,950 --> 04:18:56,070
Oh shit.

4156
04:18:59,930 --> 04:19:01,390
Fight like a man, Vol.

4157
04:19:08,380 --> 04:19:08,940
Oh!

4158
04:19:09,000 --> 04:19:09,200
Uh-oh.

4159
04:19:09,380 --> 04:19:10,860
Oh, sick bird!

4160
04:19:12,760 --> 04:19:13,620
Ah, Salat.

4161
04:19:14,120 --> 04:19:15,880
Find those bombs!

4162
04:19:15,960 --> 04:19:17,340
He's still pointing at it.

4163
04:19:17,720 --> 04:19:18,920
It's like...

4164
04:19:18,920 --> 04:19:19,840
So dramatic.

4165
04:19:23,380 --> 04:19:25,320
With the glasses.

4166
04:19:26,360 --> 04:19:28,160
What he has to see!

4167
04:19:28,400 --> 04:19:30,620
He doesn't have 2020 vision.

4168
04:19:32,580 --> 04:19:33,440
He's blind.

4169
04:19:35,300 --> 04:19:36,900
Oh, where's...

4170
04:19:36,900 --> 04:19:37,040
Oh.

4171
04:19:37,860 --> 04:19:38,000
Oh.

4172
04:19:38,660 --> 04:19:39,040
Oh.

4173
04:19:40,100 --> 04:19:41,400
It's like...

4174
04:19:41,400 --> 04:19:42,740
It's like...

4175
04:19:42,740 --> 04:19:44,100

I could do this all day.

4184
04:20:26,280 --> 04:20:27,100
You might want to kill her.

4185
04:20:28,440 --> 04:20:28,940
Oh, yeah.

4186
04:20:30,680 --> 04:20:30,860

04:20:31,400 --> 04:20:32,560
Well, I did see it.

4188
04:20:32,700 --> 04:20:35,520
Yeah, I saw that lightning coming right at me.

4189
04:20:36,420 --> 04:20:37,020
Just be ready.

4190
04:20:37,460 --> 04:20:37,940

4195
04:20:44,760 --> 04:20:45,700
Oh, it hit me.

4196
04:20:45,880 --> 04:20:46,320

4197
04:20:46,480 --> 04:20:46,940
Oh, shit!

4198
04:20:48,260 --> 04:20:49,080

See you, Sam.

4203
04:20:56,000 --> 04:20:56,600
Get dodged.

4204
04:20:56,780 --> 04:20:57,600
Now I can't, not can.

4205
04:20:57,980 --> 04:20:58,460
Now I can.

4212
04:21:05,120 --> 04:21:05,980
Wait, where's my shotgun?

4213
04:21:06,140 --> 04:21:06,780
Oh, there it is.

4214
04:21:07,420 --> 04:21:07,960
There you go.

4215
04:21:11,580 --> 04:21:11,920

04:21:14,300 --> 04:21:14,880
Oh, my God.

4217
04:21:14,940 --> 04:21:15,300
One minute.

4218
04:21:15,400 --> 04:21:15,740
Oh, God.

4219
04:21:15,880 --> 04:21:17,120
Women, not even close.

Not even close.

4221
04:21:19,420 --> 04:21:21,120
One minute remains.

4222
04:21:21,740 --> 04:21:22,680
Stop wasting time.

4223
04:21:23,500 --> 04:21:24,240
Come on.

4224
04:21:25,080 --> 04:21:25,760
Oh, God.

4225
04:21:26,780 --> 04:21:27,440
CQC.

04:21:27,820 --> 04:21:28,480
Oh, shit.

4227
04:21:29,400 --> 04:21:30,060
CQC.

04:21:30,360 --> 04:21:30,700
Oh, shit.

4229
04:21:31,340 --> 04:21:32,120
Oh, geez.

4230
04:21:32,540 --> 04:21:33,580
Oh, I want to like...

4231
04:21:33,580 --> 04:21:34,260
CQC, CQ.

4232
04:21:34,380 --> 04:21:35,960

4233
04:21:36,300 --> 04:21:36,580

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4238
04:21:41,760 --> 04:21:42,260
Yeah.

4239
04:21:42,520 --> 04:21:43,380
Get his butt.

4240
04:21:45,040 --> 04:21:45,860
There we go.

4241
04:21:45,880 --> 04:21:47,420
There you go, got it, got it, you got it.

4242
04:21:47,500 --> 04:21:48,960
Nice, you're not even close.

4243
04:21:49,980 --> 04:21:50,440
Oh, yeah.

4244
04:21:54,340 --> 04:21:54,740
Yay!

4245
04:22:02,390 --> 04:22:04,610
All right, I can get out in one minute.

4246
04:22:04,810 --> 04:22:05,710
It should be fine.

4247
04:22:06,490 --> 04:22:06,890
Easy.

4248
04:22:07,450 --> 04:22:08,970
Yeah, that's pretty easy.

4249
04:22:12,570 --> 04:22:13,810
Can't be that bad.

4250
04:22:15,550 --> 04:22:15,950
Nah.

4251
04:22:17,830 --> 04:22:18,570
Oh, shit.

4252
04:22:19,770 --> 04:22:20,250
Ew.

4253
04:22:20,790 --> 04:22:21,370
Oh, man.

4254
04:22:21,990 --> 04:22:23,170
That's like goopy blood.

4255
04:22:25,450 --> 04:22:26,770
Even Snake is going through.

4256
04:22:27,450 --> 04:22:28,650
I mean, Snake's been going through.

4257
04:22:28,890 --> 04:22:32,050
Yeah, it means I don't think he has had time to recover at
all.

4258
04:22:32,770 --> 04:22:35,310
I think there's like maybe at least 50 bullets in him.

4259
04:22:39,020 --> 04:22:39,740
Minimum, yeah.

4260
04:22:39,840 --> 04:22:40,320
Yeah, minimum.

4261
04:22:40,320 --> 04:22:43,520
This guy is like him going through a metal detector would be
insane.

4262
04:22:43,580 --> 04:22:44,280
Beep, beep, beep.

4263
04:22:45,780 --> 04:22:47,760
He'll never get an MRI ever.

4264
04:22:48,120 --> 04:22:48,540
Yeah.

4265
04:22:54,520 --> 04:22:57,040
They why did they had a full 20 minutes.

4266
04:22:57,100 --> 04:23:04,120
Yeah, you couldn't have got out wouldn't it and also that's
just that Yeah, he's like whatever it's like I hope my

4267
04:23:04,120 --> 04:23:04,840
boyfriend gets out.

4268
04:23:05,240 --> 04:23:06,260
Yeah, oh he got out.

4269
04:23:06,620 --> 04:23:07,180
Yeah

4270
04:23:11,460 --> 04:23:14,680
He's just like until we meet again

4271
04:23:18,100 --> 04:23:19,220
Hop in

4272
04:23:24,840 --> 04:23:28,760
That is the longest two minutes step on it I know.

4273
04:23:29,860 --> 04:23:31,000
It wasn't even two minutes.

4274
04:23:31,120 --> 04:23:31,900
It was less than a minute.

4275
04:23:32,160 --> 04:23:33,940
Yeah, it was a minute and 30 seconds.

4276
04:23:39,410 --> 04:23:40,470
Oh, shit.

4277
04:23:40,730 --> 04:23:42,270
Oh, no.

4278
04:23:43,570 --> 04:23:44,050
Oh, no.

4279
04:23:44,510 --> 04:23:44,990
Five.

4280
04:23:45,550 --> 04:23:46,030
Johnny.

4281
04:23:47,030 --> 04:23:47,850
Johnny, too.

4282
04:23:49,430 --> 04:23:54,230
I mean, if they hadn't gotten got by the explosion, they
would have got got by you.

4283
04:23:54,810 --> 04:23:56,690
Literally, that's what you would have done to him.

4284
04:23:56,750 --> 04:23:57,450
Set him on five.

4285
04:23:57,670 --> 04:23:58,210
That's true.

4286
04:24:00,230 --> 04:24:03,830
the boss let me go the river oh my god that crooked

4287
04:24:08,090 --> 04:24:25,290

hat's covering the booms the sacrifices we make holy he's

4288
04:24:25,290 --> 04:24:26,280
jumping down

4289
04:24:31,850 --> 04:24:34,270
I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you.

4290
04:24:35,330 --> 04:24:36,910
Oh, yeah, the boss is at the lake.

4291
04:24:40,550 --> 04:24:42,190
I don't want you to fight her.

4292
04:24:42,930 --> 04:24:43,210
Why?

4293
04:24:44,170 --> 04:24:45,670
It's my final mission.

4294
04:24:46,570 --> 04:24:49,690
I've come to realize that there's a special relationship
between...

4295
04:24:49,690 --> 04:24:50,990
I gotta do this, though.

4296
04:24:52,430 --> 04:24:54,310
Something I can't understand.

4297
04:24:54,490 --> 04:24:56,750
Something that goes beyond a man and a woman.

4298
04:24:58,230 --> 04:24:59,130
I envy you.

Do I have to worry about the guys behind me?

4474
04:39:45,750 --> 04:39:46,890
No, okay.

4475
04:39:47,870 --> 04:39:49,780

4476
04:39:57,120 --> 04:39:58,200

All right.

4478
04:39:59,680 --> 04:40:00,540
One shot.

4479
04:40:01,080 --> 04:40:01,640
Oh, never mind.

4480
04:40:01,820 --> 04:40:02,060

Yeah.

4483
04:40:05,060 --> 04:40:08,480
I'd say I feel like you have like one more hour to go.

4484
04:40:10,100 --> 04:40:10,860
From the game.

4485
04:40:11,000 --> 04:40:11,500
What?

4486
04:40:12,760 --> 04:40:13,300

4487
04:40:13,560 --> 04:40:14,340
Is that too much?

4488
04:40:16,640 --> 04:40:17,520
No, no.

4489
04:40:17,700 --> 04:40:20,540
It's just, this really does feel end game, but okay.

4490
04:40:20,680 --> 04:40:29,020
give me like one hour of cutscenes right like um well that's
part of the hour oh okay

4491
04:40:35,820 --> 04:40:42,280
but when the fuck do i have more cutscenes than gameplay
there's like four i'd say like four more big events that you

4492
04:40:42,280 --> 04:41:00,220
have to do and then you're good oh oh r1 yeah yeah yeah oh
all right now just wait until he's on the bridge she's gonna

4648
04:50:05,590 --> 04:50:10,350

Yeah.

4656
04:50:46,190 --> 04:50:47,230

04:50:59,540 --> 04:51:00,980
How is he still shooting?

4660
04:51:01,820 --> 04:51:02,080
Okay.

4661
04:51:03,920 --> 04:51:04,680
There we go.

4662
04:51:05,280 --> 04:51:05,400

That's so much for like the, I'll distract him, you know.

4664
04:51:08,960 --> 04:51:09,260
Yeah.

4665
04:51:09,460 --> 04:51:10,320
Why is this happening?

4666
04:51:11,080 --> 04:51:12,000
Why is this happening?

4667
04:51:12,000 --> 04:51:12,160
Yeah.

4668
04:51:12,300 --> 04:51:13,240
Why is this happening?

4669
04:51:14,500 --> 04:51:16,340

4670
04:51:20,280 --> 04:51:21,160

Yeah, Evo, why aren't you distracting him?

4676
04:51:28,780 --> 04:51:30,400
Why are you not distracting him?

4677
04:51:30,960 --> 04:51:33,840
I did 20 years to reload my fucking missiles!

4678
04:51:34,700 --> 04:51:34,980
Okay.

04:51:36,480 --> 04:51:37,780

04:51:37,980 --> 04:51:38,960
She's so rude.

4681
04:51:39,880 --> 04:51:42,640
Yeah, why aren't you doing the thing that I want you to do?

4682
04:51:42,640 --> 04:51:43,560

That's the end.

04:54:17,980 --> 04:54:19,060
Feliz Navida.

4710
04:54:19,540 --> 04:54:20,520
It's finally over.

4711
04:54:21,340 --> 04:54:22,980
Oh, I thought so too.

4712
04:54:23,440 --> 04:54:24,900
Why did you say Feliz Navida?

4713
04:54:27,620 --> 04:54:29,280
It's Happy New Year!

4714
04:54:34,220 --> 04:54:35,060
This

4715
04:54:41,710 --> 04:54:43,090
seems very...

4716
04:54:43,750 --> 04:54:46,370
Look, oh, this is the ghost.

4717
04:54:46,710 --> 04:54:47,490
This is San Lee.

4718
04:54:48,930 --> 04:54:50,610
Oh, no, you're getting chased again.

4719
04:54:51,130 --> 04:54:51,490
By who?

4720
04:54:51,790 --> 04:54:53,030
I killed the leader.

4721
04:54:54,510 --> 04:54:55,810
No, it's time to go.

4722
04:54:56,450 --> 04:54:58,230
The escape craft is just up ahead.

4723
04:55:01,210 --> 04:55:02,330
Oh, my God.

4724
04:55:09,070 --> 04:55:10,030
Let's get going.

4725
04:55:19,820 --> 04:55:22,640
Also, guys, I saw you saying that the reload does work.

4726
04:55:22,740 --> 04:55:24,320
It definitely didn't work when I played.

4727
04:55:24,480 --> 04:55:26,260
So unless they patched it, then I don't know.

4728

04:56:16,340 --> 04:56:18,400
Alright, I'm gonna fucking reload my RPG.

Over here.

4741
04:56:26,960 --> 04:56:28,440
Like, I would just leave.

4742
04:56:28,440 --> 04:56:28,920

4743
04:56:29,720 --> 04:56:30,440

Alright.

4746
04:56:37,620 --> 04:56:38,160
I love this.

4747
04:56:40,380 --> 04:56:41,960
Oh, reloading, reloading, reloading!

4748
04:56:42,100 --> 04:56:42,540
Oh, shit!

4749
04:56:43,880 --> 04:56:44,460
It's fine.

4750
04:56:44,660 --> 04:56:45,220
Yeah, it's fine.

4751
04:56:45,420 --> 04:56:46,460
They're not really...

4752
04:56:46,460 --> 04:56:46,920
Yeah.

4753
04:56:47,020 --> 04:56:49,740
Yeah, they're not really that much of a risk to be fair.

4754
04:56:51,320 --> 04:56:53,440
Yeah, who's paying for these motorcycles?

4755
04:56:54,620 --> 04:56:55,200
I know.

4756
04:56:55,740 --> 04:56:56,420
It's an ambush.

4757
04:56:56,740 --> 04:56:57,440
It's an ambush?

4758
04:56:57,440 --> 04:56:58,960
It's been an ambush.

4759
04:56:59,000 --> 04:57:00,900
Yes, it's all been an ambush.

4760
04:57:01,120 --> 04:57:02,300
Wait, this is just what?

4761
04:57:02,520 --> 04:57:04,800
Oh, I do have to kill him Why she stops here.

4762
04:57:05,040 --> 04:57:07,380
I'm just like you could have just killed him.

4763
04:57:08,000 --> 04:57:08,480
Oh my god.

4764
04:57:08,640 --> 04:57:10,660
Do you want me to shoot them or not Eva?

4765
04:57:11,020 --> 04:57:12,440
Just so my okay.

4766
04:57:12,880 --> 04:57:12,880
Okay.

4767
04:57:13,380 --> 04:57:13,940
She does not.

4768
04:57:14,660 --> 04:57:17,060
She is so obnoxious and she gets worse.

4769
04:57:17,300 --> 04:57:17,520
I'm sorry.

4770
04:57:18,040 --> 04:57:21,220
Okay, all right I like literally do not have to shoot
anything.

4771
04:57:21,420 --> 04:57:21,840
I hear that.

4772
04:57:22,200 --> 04:57:22,580
Okay

4773
04:57:27,440 --> 04:57:28,320
I don't know.

4774
04:57:34,360 --> 04:57:36,700
Am I supposed to be watching or playing?

4775
04:57:36,900 --> 04:57:38,140
She's testing your skills.

4776
04:57:38,700 --> 04:57:39,440
I can't tell.

4777
04:57:39,960 --> 04:57:43,640
I can't tell if I'm supposed to be watching or playing at
this point.

4778
04:57:43,900 --> 04:57:46,520
Like, at this point, I can literally just not do anything.

4779
04:57:47,240 --> 04:57:50,640
Also, you're going to have to watch out for your front, too,
because you have to shoot the logs.

4780
04:57:51,600 --> 04:57:51,860
What?

4781
04:57:52,480 --> 04:57:55,280
Yeah, there's, like, logs in the road or something.

4782
04:57:56,880 --> 04:57:58,640
These seeds are so chaotic.

4783
04:57:59,340 --> 04:58:00,800
It's always the same.

4784
04:58:00,820 --> 04:58:02,160
It's always bad.

4785
04:58:06,280 --> 04:58:06,800
Like...

4786
04:58:06,800 --> 04:58:08,180
Oh my god.

4787
04:58:11,520 --> 04:58:12,720
Why is it not shooting?

4788
04:58:12,900 --> 04:58:13,700
Okay, there it is.

4789
04:58:13,800 --> 04:58:14,000
Okay.

4790
04:58:14,960 --> 04:58:15,980
Okay, it's fine.

4791
04:58:18,400 --> 04:58:19,380
No, she can't jump in.

4792
04:58:19,400 --> 04:58:20,120
Not this time.

4793
04:58:20,760 --> 04:58:22,700
Like, I can't shoot him because he's...

4794
04:58:22,700 --> 04:58:23,300
Oh my...

4795
04:58:23,300 --> 04:58:23,560
Okay.

4796
04:58:28,490 --> 04:58:30,950
I actually have to, like, do like, a scroll.

4797
04:58:31,770 --> 04:58:32,290
Okay.

4798
04:58:33,810 --> 04:58:35,470
Oh my god, why isn't it shooting?

4799
04:58:39,290 --> 04:58:43,050
The fucking slowest turn of my life.

4800
04:58:45,870 --> 04:58:45,890
Yeah.

4801
04:58:46,970 --> 04:58:47,830
Oh, there's a log.

4802
04:58:48,050 --> 04:58:48,850
You gotta get the log.

4803
04:58:50,270 --> 04:58:50,830
Shoot the log.

4804
04:58:51,290 --> 04:58:52,010
Where is it?

4805
04:58:52,570 --> 04:58:53,370
Did I shot it?

4806
04:58:54,190 --> 04:58:55,090
That right there.

4807
04:58:55,270 --> 04:58:55,610
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

4808
04:58:55,610 --> 04:58:56,150
I got it, I got it.

4809
04:58:56,330 --> 04:59:00,390
For some reason, she can't jump over it like she's done in
the past.

4810
04:59:01,070 --> 04:59:01,190
But.

4811
04:59:03,290 --> 04:59:05,130
Oh my god, there you go.

4812
04:59:06,110 --> 04:59:10,150
It's just too much pressure, you know It's fine.

4813
04:59:10,290 --> 04:59:11,470
You're not taking like oh there we go.

4814
04:59:11,670 --> 04:59:11,910
We're good.

4815
04:59:11,910 --> 04:59:12,250
We're good.

4816
04:59:12,650 --> 04:59:13,030
Yeah, yeah

4817
04:59:16,050 --> 04:59:19,390
Yeah, I swear to God I'm about to shoot another dog.

4818
04:59:19,750 --> 04:59:24,250

04:59:24,250 --> 04:59:25,410
Oh, where is he?

4820
04:59:25,650 --> 04:59:26,150
Where is he?

4821
04:59:26,730 --> 04:59:28,030
Oh my god, where the fucking?

4822
04:59:29,010 --> 04:59:30,110

That felt much better.

4833
05:00:38,940 --> 05:00:39,920
Here comes her jump.

4834
05:00:40,360 --> 05:00:41,620

Okay, that's a big jump.

Beat it.

4838
05:00:52,280 --> 05:00:53,320
What'd you think of that?

4839
05:00:53,620 --> 05:00:54,840
She's, like, so quiet.

4840
05:00:55,120 --> 05:00:56,600
Because she's all the way over there.

4841
05:00:57,300 --> 05:00:59,180
I can't hear her talking.

4842
05:01:01,200 --> 05:01:02,760
Zau's yours, Ewest.

4843
05:01:03,140 --> 05:01:03,580
Nice.

4844
05:01:04,260 --> 05:01:04,660
Thanks.

4845
05:01:09,320 --> 05:01:11,000
Looks like they finally gave up.

4846
05:01:11,380 --> 05:01:12,280
Don't start celebrating.

4847
05:01:12,720 --> 05:01:13,920
We're leaking fuel.

4848
05:01:13,960 --> 05:01:14,620
Oh, shit.

4849
05:01:15,680 --> 05:01:17,420
Just get a band-aid.

4850
05:01:18,320 --> 05:01:19,820
Just hold your hand on top.

4851
05:01:20,360 --> 05:01:21,840
Get your finger and plug it up.

4852
05:01:22,820 --> 05:01:24,480
Literally just plug it up with your finger.

4853
05:01:24,740 --> 05:01:25,200
Oh, my God, Eva.

4854
05:01:25,480 --> 05:01:26,240
Oh, my God, Eva.

4855
05:01:26,340 --> 05:01:26,820
Oh, Eva.

4856
05:01:27,100 --> 05:01:27,620
No.

4857
05:01:36,480 --> 05:01:38,420
No, she's going to be depressed.

4858
05:01:42,160 --> 05:01:44,040
It's literally her life.

4859
05:01:45,400 --> 05:01:47,240
She's going to be depressed.

4860
05:01:51,260 --> 05:01:53,900
Oh, Snake, you were supposed to shoot the logs.

4861
05:01:54,260 --> 05:01:55,680
Stokey, why didn't you shoot the log?

4862
05:01:56,840 --> 05:01:58,200
I was looking at the fuel!

4863
05:01:59,620 --> 05:01:59,840
Oh?

4864
05:02:00,960 --> 05:02:01,820
Is she okay?

4865
05:02:11,210 --> 05:02:12,590
She seems fine.

4866
05:02:13,070 --> 05:02:14,190
Does he have a hole in his ass?

4867
05:02:14,450 --> 05:02:14,790
Does he?

4868
05:02:15,970 --> 05:02:17,490
Sure did look like him.

4869
05:02:20,940 --> 05:02:21,700
Yeah, see...

4870
05:02:21,700 --> 05:02:22,320
Oh.

4871
05:02:26,570 --> 05:02:27,050
Oh.

4872
05:02:27,410 --> 05:02:31,290
It looks alright.

4873
05:02:31,690 --> 05:02:32,570
Is this...

4874
05:02:32,570 --> 05:02:33,690
It's alright.

4875
05:02:35,750 --> 05:02:36,430
Oh.

4876
05:02:40,170 --> 05:02:40,450
Oh.

4877
05:02:41,510 --> 05:02:41,790
Oh.

4878
05:02:41,930 --> 05:02:42,550
Oh, she's such a...

4879
05:02:42,550 --> 05:02:43,750
She's such a pussy.

4880
05:02:44,050 --> 05:02:46,670
Oh, I have like 20 bullets in my body.

4881
05:02:49,090 --> 05:02:51,030
She's not built for this.

4882
05:02:54,470 --> 05:02:56,310
Snake is a brick wall.

4883
05:02:56,710 --> 05:02:57,390
Oh.

4884
05:02:57,410 --> 05:03:11,430
Let's go Okay, we could literally like take that out and
then like get to go get a lighter and Stitch that up I don't

4885
05:03:11,430 --> 05:03:20,710
know about that Surely it didn't hit any sensitive organs It
looked like it passed right through See you act this week

4886
05:03:20,710 --> 05:03:27,970
Now he's saying exactly what he said Like bro, it's such a
pussy I can do that in front of snake.

4887
05:03:28,850 --> 05:03:30,130
Oh my god.

4888
05:03:32,630 --> 05:03:34,110
I need you.

4889
05:03:34,190 --> 05:03:35,130
Say that one more time.

4890
05:03:36,770 --> 05:03:37,750
I need you.

4891
05:03:37,930 --> 05:03:38,310
Oh.

4892
05:03:39,850 --> 05:03:42,370
I can't fly the wig by myself.

4893
05:03:47,050 --> 05:03:48,890
That's the only reason.

4894
05:03:48,970 --> 05:03:51,810
He's like, I don't have a flying license.

4895
05:03:54,170 --> 05:03:55,590
He's so stupid.

4896
05:03:55,610 --> 05:03:58,810

4897
05:04:05,170 --> 05:04:15,910

wound i think you're bleeding out she's holding one side but

4899
05:04:24,550 --> 05:04:31,470

boy.

4900
05:04:32,090 --> 05:04:34,010
Oh, I have my first aid menu.

4901
05:04:35,630 --> 05:04:36,510
Okay, tutorial time.

4902
05:04:36,670 --> 05:04:37,950
The game is just getting started.

4903
05:04:38,650 --> 05:04:40,210
Oh my god, I finally beat the tutorial.

4904
05:04:40,850 --> 05:04:41,190
Yeah.

4905
05:04:43,930 --> 05:04:45,410
Snake, can you hear me?

4906
05:04:45,570 --> 05:04:45,890
Yeah.

4907
05:04:45,890 --> 05:04:46,430
Yeah, I'm medic.

4908
05:04:46,830 --> 05:04:47,450
Thank God.

4909
05:04:47,970 --> 05:04:49,370
Eva's been seriously hurt.

4910
05:04:49,850 --> 05:04:51,270
Yeah, I took her to like...

4911
05:04:51,270 --> 05:04:52,870
Luckily, I think her organs are all intact.

4912
05:04:53,470 --> 05:04:54,410
See, I told you.

4913
05:04:54,510 --> 05:04:55,830
It went through the organs.

4914
05:04:56,750 --> 05:04:58,390
Around the organs, not through.

4915
05:04:58,530 --> 05:04:58,790
Yeah.

4916
05:04:59,090 --> 05:05:01,190
I was trying to run around the organs.

4917
05:05:01,970 --> 05:05:02,510
I understand.

4918
05:05:03,010 --> 05:05:04,450
So you've got to calm down.

4919
05:05:05,210 --> 05:05:05,210
Right.

4920
05:05:05,870 --> 05:05:06,310
Okay.

4921
05:05:07,410 --> 05:05:07,410
Okay.

4922
05:05:08,010 --> 05:05:10,690
Now let's open up the survival viewer and treat the injury.

4923
05:05:11,070 --> 05:05:12,270
Do you have supplies with you?

4924
05:05:12,790 --> 05:05:14,250
I'm running kind of short.

4925
05:05:14,950 --> 05:05:18,750
Then by switching the survival viewer over to Eva, you can
treat her wounds too.

4926
05:05:19,150 --> 05:05:20,390
Now get to work.

4927
05:05:20,650 --> 05:05:20,910
Yeah.

4928
05:05:21,490 --> 05:05:23,530
I'm pretty sure you know this already.

4929
05:05:24,050 --> 05:05:27,930
But if you don't have enough supplies for the both of you,
your wounds come first.

4930
05:05:29,310 --> 05:05:31,090
Do you get my meaning, Snake?

4931
05:05:31,970 --> 05:05:33,450
You've still got a mission to complete.

4932
05:05:35,170 --> 05:05:37,330
She's like, kill her if you have to.

4933
05:05:39,030 --> 05:05:40,450
But she hot.

4934
05:05:42,810 --> 05:05:43,110
Alright.

4935
05:05:43,710 --> 05:05:44,150
Kira.

4936
05:05:45,470 --> 05:05:46,170
Wait, wait.

4937
05:05:46,350 --> 05:05:47,050
Me first.

4938
05:05:48,350 --> 05:05:48,950
That's fine.

4939
05:05:49,110 --> 05:05:50,370
I have so much.

4940
05:05:51,530 --> 05:05:54,030
Okay, have fun with this next part.

4941
05:05:54,770 --> 05:05:56,290
Alright, and then...

4942
05:05:56,290 --> 05:05:57,030
Bleeding.

4943
05:05:59,110 --> 05:05:59,630
Infect.

4944
05:06:00,010 --> 05:06:00,270
Boom.

4945
05:06:00,510 --> 05:06:00,990
See it.

4946
05:06:01,270 --> 05:06:01,590
Easy.

4947
05:06:02,070 --> 05:06:02,910
Afflicted area.

4948
05:06:03,030 --> 05:06:03,630
Now you see.

4949
05:06:03,690 --> 05:06:04,390
That's split.

4950
05:06:05,470 --> 05:06:05,990
Bandage.

4951
05:06:06,110 --> 05:06:06,670
There you go.

4952
05:06:07,010 --> 05:06:07,510
Alright, Eva.

4953
05:06:08,250 --> 05:06:09,650
Can I actually leave her to die?

4954
05:06:10,970 --> 05:06:12,210
Uh, I don't think so.

4955
05:06:12,750 --> 05:06:13,230
Oh, so.

4956
05:06:13,610 --> 05:06:15,030
Like, I just don't heal her.

4957
05:06:17,430 --> 05:06:17,950
Alright.

4958
05:06:18,110 --> 05:06:19,350
Wound bleeding.

4959
05:06:21,370 --> 05:06:21,690
Uh.

4960
05:06:23,070 --> 05:06:27,230
Yeah, there's some fun little secrets if you, like, look at
her medical history.

4961
05:06:27,230 --> 05:06:39,370
oh i didn't check her medical history i just went straight
to curing her because i am a gentleman yeah i was so focused

4962
05:06:45,040 --> 05:06:47,680

4963
05:06:52,320 --> 05:07:02,080
oh she's looking at my lips my eyes are up here she wants
you so bad oh here Take my gun.

4964
05:07:03,940 --> 05:07:04,720
Are you still check?

4965
05:07:07,000 --> 05:07:09,220
Time to geek out.

4966
05:07:09,520 --> 05:07:10,620
All right, all right, snake.

4967
05:07:10,880 --> 05:07:12,100
Give us 10 minutes of this.

4968
05:07:15,180 --> 05:07:17,300
That's like first date material.

4969
05:07:18,320 --> 05:07:19,960
That's what you know he's into you.

4970
05:07:20,160 --> 05:07:20,840
Oh, yeah.

4971
05:07:21,100 --> 05:07:22,180
Tells you about his gun.

4972
05:07:24,100 --> 05:07:25,540
And not the one in the pants.

4973
05:07:28,120 --> 05:07:28,440
Ooh.

4974
05:07:31,680 --> 05:07:33,280
Wait, I can see you see it.

4975
05:07:35,760 --> 05:07:36,740
Snake, are you all right?

4976
05:07:37,400 --> 05:07:38,620
I've been better.

4977
05:07:39,400 --> 05:07:39,940
What about Eva?

4978
05:07:40,660 --> 05:07:41,500
I healed her up.

4979
05:07:42,000 --> 05:07:42,660
She can manage.

4980
05:07:44,700 --> 05:07:47,700
Snake, you'll take the lead and break through the enemy's
line of defense.

4981
05:07:48,800 --> 05:07:50,740
Eva will ordinarily be following behind you.

4982
05:07:51,100 --> 05:07:53,200
If you lie on your belly, she'll lie down as well.

4983
05:07:53,660 --> 05:07:56,560
If you slip and fall off a cliff, she'll follow right
behind.

4984
05:07:57,380 --> 05:08:00,280
You can call out to Eva by pressing the action button.

4985
05:08:01,000 --> 05:08:01,840
God, is this...

4986
05:08:02,800 --> 05:08:04,740
Is this an escort mission?

4987
05:08:06,220 --> 05:08:07,180
Yep, baby.

4988
05:08:08,080 --> 05:08:09,020
Have fun.

4989
05:08:10,380 --> 05:08:11,420
Oh, it's bad.

4990
05:08:12,440 --> 05:08:14,260
It's several areas, too.

4991
05:08:16,880 --> 05:08:20,760
But it's just this, and then one more thing, and then you're
done.

4992
05:08:22,240 --> 05:08:23,200
What's the survivor?

4993
05:08:23,340 --> 05:08:24,200
Wait, what's the...

4994
05:08:24,200 --> 05:08:25,540
And then a lot of cutscenes, but yeah.

4995
05:08:25,700 --> 05:08:27,480
Wait, how do I look at her?

4996
05:08:28,100 --> 05:08:28,760
Oh, medical history.

4997
05:08:28,760 --> 05:08:29,880
Oh, medical history, yeah, triangle.

4998
05:08:31,180 --> 05:08:32,300
back pain.

4999
05:08:32,500 --> 05:08:33,560
She got the tummy ache.

5000
05:08:34,060 --> 05:08:35,120
Oh, she got tummy ache.

5001
05:08:35,320 --> 05:08:36,000
Oh, I get that.

5002
05:08:36,000 --> 05:08:36,360
Broken meal.

5003
05:08:36,940 --> 05:08:45,760
Okay, frost, but gunshot wound, bronchitis, breast
enhancement, sleep paralysis, cavity.

5004
05:08:47,000 --> 05:08:47,140
Okay.

5005
05:08:47,640 --> 05:08:48,620
What is that?

5006
05:08:48,820 --> 05:08:48,960
What?

5007
05:08:49,440 --> 05:08:51,220
You can see your food history too.

5008
05:08:51,340 --> 05:08:51,980
It's just kind of funny.

5009
05:08:52,220 --> 05:08:52,220
Oh, shit.

5010
05:08:52,600 --> 05:08:52,600
Okay.

5011
05:08:52,900 --> 05:08:57,920
Stomach ache, broken nail, cord, a blow, sustain.

5012
05:09:00,200 --> 05:09:00,820
Hey, chill.

5013
05:09:01,000 --> 05:09:02,040
Bless you.

5014
05:09:02,320 --> 05:09:02,620
Thank you.

5015
05:09:03,160 --> 05:09:04,280
Electrical burn.

5016
05:09:05,040 --> 05:09:07,620
Those are all vulgan.

5017
05:09:08,860 --> 05:09:09,440
All right.

5018
05:09:09,980 --> 05:09:10,900
Melon tofu.

5019
05:09:11,100 --> 05:09:12,360
Damn, she eating good.

5020
05:09:12,800 --> 05:09:17,840
I like to look at her food history and then go to my food
history and just compare the two.

5021
05:09:18,040 --> 05:09:19,480
Seafood, fried rice.

5022
05:09:19,600 --> 05:09:20,860
Grilled picking dogs.

5023
05:09:21,460 --> 05:09:23,080
Russian floss, mango, gelato.

5024
05:09:23,900 --> 05:09:25,440
Gorgonzola cream, fettuccine.

5025
05:09:25,580 --> 05:09:26,340
I hate her.

5026
05:09:26,640 --> 05:09:29,980
I mean, I had a pretty good time until vulture, vulture,
vulture, vulture.

5027
05:09:34,620 --> 05:09:36,020
It's like, it was all right.

5028
05:09:36,160 --> 05:09:39,520
It's like, rat ration, tree, frog.

5029
05:09:41,780 --> 05:09:44,400
It's a vulture, vulture, vulture, vulture, vulture.

5030
05:09:45,660 --> 05:09:47,320
Hey, those were apparently pretty good.

5031
05:09:47,720 --> 05:09:48,660
Yeah, apparently I killed.

5032
05:09:48,680 --> 05:09:50,420
She's out here having cheese omelets.

5033
05:09:50,780 --> 05:09:56,000
Yeah, apparently I killed so many vultures that they showed
up in the fucking river.

5034
05:09:56,460 --> 05:10:02,540
But like, but like when, but no other animals showed up
except.

5035
05:10:03,780 --> 05:10:04,180
Yeah,

5036
05:10:08,210 --> 05:10:12,250
I think I killed a little bit too many vultures there.

5037
05:10:13,330 --> 05:10:14,310
Okay, wait, do I have?

5038
05:10:15,530 --> 05:10:17,790
All right, I don't need luck.

5039
05:10:19,330 --> 05:10:20,870
I'll just kill everything on my path.

5040
05:10:21,090 --> 05:10:22,830
She's so obnoxious, though, I'll let you know.

5041
05:10:23,310 --> 05:10:24,430
Oh, God, all right.

5042
05:10:25,010 --> 05:10:25,390
It's fine.

5043
05:10:25,390 --> 05:10:30,450
You can knock her out and carry her, but you can't go into
other areas without her being conscious.

5044
05:10:31,070 --> 05:10:31,510
All right.

5045
05:10:31,750 --> 05:10:33,250
She's not following you, by the way.

5046
05:10:34,670 --> 05:10:36,050
Like turn around?

5047
05:10:37,830 --> 05:10:38,970
Oh my god.

5048
05:10:39,130 --> 05:10:40,710
I cured you.

5049
05:10:41,030 --> 05:10:42,730
She still has a stab.

5050
05:10:43,110 --> 05:10:45,710
I cured you.

5051
05:10:48,750 --> 05:10:50,770
I don't understand.

5052
05:10:52,190 --> 05:10:55,010
All right, back to my naked woodland.

5053
05:10:55,970 --> 05:11:01,350
In case you missed it, Doki, Eva actually ate all the ramen
and calorie mates from your old food inventory when you lost

5054
05:11:01,350 --> 05:11:01,930

They're behind you.

5068
05:12:24,500 --> 05:12:27,360
Remember, they came in from behind you and she didn't follow
you.

5069
05:12:27,520 --> 05:12:28,460
So they saw her.

5070
05:12:28,800 --> 05:12:29,380
Is she okay?

5071
05:12:29,380 --> 05:12:30,360
And now they're killing her.

05:12:35,700 --> 05:12:37,040

Hey, you guys.

5154
05:18:38,030 --> 05:18:39,290

Oh, there she goes.

05:18:43,150 --> 05:18:44,150
Slowly but surely.

5160
05:18:44,270 --> 05:18:45,290
She's coming over.

5161
05:18:45,410 --> 05:18:46,290

05:18:46,750 --> 05:18:48,130

05:21:21,900 --> 05:21:23,360
She tries to be insane.

05:21:24,600 --> 05:21:27,280
Oh, you're not race baiting me right now.

There you go.

5206
05:21:33,120 --> 05:21:34,260
Okay, she can go down.

5207
05:21:34,380 --> 05:21:35,480
She can go down.

5208
05:21:35,680 --> 05:21:36,300
Oh, my.

5209
05:21:36,620 --> 05:21:36,860
Oh.

5210
05:21:37,560 --> 05:21:38,320
Did you see him?

5211
05:21:40,880 --> 05:21:41,360
Oh.

5212
05:21:42,380 --> 05:21:42,860
Okay.

5213
05:21:43,260 --> 05:21:44,780
That was the last guy.

5214
05:21:46,820 --> 05:21:47,300
Yep.

5215
05:21:48,220 --> 05:21:48,880
All right.

5216
05:21:49,420 --> 05:21:50,020
Okay, it's there.

5217
05:21:50,080 --> 05:21:50,980
All right, I'm going to...

5218
05:21:50,980 --> 05:21:52,200
Okay, I need food.

5219
05:21:52,720 --> 05:21:53,500
Do you have food?

5220
05:21:53,600 --> 05:21:53,820
Yeah.

5221
05:21:54,260 --> 05:21:55,000
Oh, man.

5222
05:21:55,400 --> 05:21:58,140
You'll have food in the fight, but, you know.

5223
05:21:58,180 --> 05:21:58,920
Okay, that's good.

5224
05:21:58,940 --> 05:22:00,820
That was a sick-ass headshot I did.

5225
05:22:01,760 --> 05:22:02,460
Alright, get over here.

5226
05:22:02,480 --> 05:22:02,900
Come on, Eva.

5227
05:22:04,320 --> 05:22:05,760
Yeah, that was good.

5228
05:22:07,340 --> 05:22:07,820
Eva!

5229
05:22:08,180 --> 05:22:08,420
Eva?

5230
05:22:09,020 --> 05:22:10,000
Wait, where is she?

5231
05:22:10,660 --> 05:22:10,860
Eva?

5232
05:22:12,320 --> 05:22:12,800
Eva?

5233
05:22:12,800 --> 05:22:14,300
You could farm food here, for real.

5234
05:22:15,220 --> 05:22:15,700
Eva.

5235
05:22:16,500 --> 05:22:17,400
Eva, get over here.

5236
05:22:17,460 --> 05:22:19,280
I'm eating the last Russian ration.

5237
05:22:19,460 --> 05:22:20,200
Fuck you, Eva.

5238
05:22:20,520 --> 05:22:22,440
I'm eating the last Russian.

5239
05:22:25,540 --> 05:22:26,420
Eva, please.

5240
05:22:27,160 --> 05:22:28,360
Eva, I have several more.

5241
05:22:28,940 --> 05:22:30,480
Eva, please.

5242
05:22:30,880 --> 05:22:33,180
I have several more places to go.

5243
05:22:34,920 --> 05:22:35,100
No.

5244
05:22:35,680 --> 05:22:36,760
You're so close.

5245
05:22:38,720 --> 05:22:39,020
All right.

5246
05:22:39,120 --> 05:22:40,720
Do you have any Russian ration?

5247
05:22:42,900 --> 05:22:43,740
Oh, my God.

5248
05:22:43,860 --> 05:22:44,360
It's just bullets.

5249
05:22:44,360 --> 05:22:46,380
It's like bullets I don't even need.

5250
05:22:46,800 --> 05:22:47,960
Oh, my God.

5251
05:22:48,240 --> 05:22:49,000
Just don't even.

5252
05:22:49,200 --> 05:22:50,220
Just ignore her.

5253
05:22:50,400 --> 05:22:50,680
Just go.

5254
05:22:51,160 --> 05:22:51,220
Yeah.

5255
05:22:51,980 --> 05:22:52,580
It's okay.

5256
05:22:53,020 --> 05:22:53,360
It's okay.

5257
05:22:53,500 --> 05:22:55,160
There's no way she can die from starvation.

5258
05:22:56,300 --> 05:22:56,480
No.

5259
05:22:56,660 --> 05:22:58,620
She'll get a nice caviar meal later.

5260
05:22:59,960 --> 05:23:11,810
but I'm so hungry oh my god Eva please so how please you can
please you can last like ten more minutes if you're so

5261
05:23:11,810 --> 05:23:23,390

5262
05:23:37,430 --> 05:23:49,740

5264
05:24:02,960 --> 05:24:16,100

hungry no more oh okay it's the boss isn't it I'll go get

5265
05:24:16,100 --> 05:24:25,840
the wig ready to take off right I'll leave you two alone but
come back in one piece okay

5266
05:24:28,900 --> 05:24:34,440
One piece One piece Promise me

5267
05:24:40,150 --> 05:24:48,130
Oh my god And she's just running Prancing around to the
plane Oh yeah like Yeah the fucking wound that you got

5268
05:24:48,130 --> 05:24:52,250
earlier Oh shit What the fuck

5269
05:24:55,950 --> 05:25:13,690
Whoa What the fuck was that the plane planes life's end
isn't it beautiful they're so beautiful when life ends it

5270
05:25:13,690 --> 05:25:24,410
gives off a final lingering aroma light is but a farewell
gift from the darkness to those on their way to die i've

5271
05:25:24,410 --> 05:25:27,070
been waiting snake for a long time

5272
05:25:30,270 --> 05:25:47,170
your growth and the finality of today boss why are you doing
this why to make the world one again oh the world used to be

5273
05:25:47,170 --> 05:25:54,370
whole but with the end of the second world war the
philosophers began to fight amongst themselves and the world

5274
05:25:54,370 --> 05:26:01,570
was torn apart the Cobras all comrades who trained and
fought alongside me were torn apart as well.

5275
05:26:03,130 --> 05:26:09,810
The foothills of politics and a march of time can turn
friends into enemies just as easily as the wind changes.

5276
05:26:11,030 --> 05:26:12,110
Ridiculous, isn't it?

5277
05:26:14,690 --> 05:26:17,110
Yesterday's ally becomes today's opposition.

5278
05:26:19,410 --> 05:26:20,850
You good?

5279
05:26:21,030 --> 05:26:21,410
Yeah.

5280
05:26:22,010 --> 05:26:23,090
I'm alright.

5281
05:26:23,350 --> 05:26:25,250
As America and Russia were fighting together.

5282
05:26:26,870 --> 05:26:34,170
Now, consider whether America and Russia still be enemies in
the 21st century oh yeah

5283
05:26:39,850 --> 05:26:43,310
boss oh boss and we soldiers are so helpful

5284
05:26:47,650 --> 05:26:55,790
i didn't raise you and shape you into the man you are today
just so we could face each other in battle a soldier's

5285
05:26:55,790 --> 05:27:02,090
skills aren't meant to be used to hurt friends So then what
is an enemy?

5286
05:27:04,430 --> 05:27:07,050
Is there such a thing as an absolute timeless enemy?

5287
05:27:08,850 --> 05:27:11,430
There is no such thing, and never has been.

5288
05:27:12,790 --> 05:27:15,970
And the reason is that our enemies are human beings like us.

5289
05:27:17,530 --> 05:27:20,030
They can only be our enemies in relative terms.

5290
05:27:23,230 --> 05:27:25,210
The world must be made whole again.

5291
05:27:26,710 --> 05:27:28,950
The philosophers must be reunited.

5292
05:27:30,050 --> 05:27:32,170
I will devote my skills to that purpose.

5293
05:27:32,450 --> 05:27:33,730
We are the world.

5294
05:27:34,010 --> 05:27:36,290
And with the Colonel's money, we are the pain.

5295
05:27:37,350 --> 05:27:38,670
Yeah, just don't worry.

5296
05:27:39,050 --> 05:27:41,410
Michael Jackson will unite us all.

5297
05:27:44,270 --> 05:27:45,630
It's Macross.

5298
05:27:47,430 --> 05:27:50,310
Oh, but I still have a family.

5299
05:27:53,800 --> 05:27:57,280
It was November 1st, 1951.

5300
05:27:57,340 --> 05:27:58,560
Oh, my God.

5301
05:27:58,920 --> 05:28:00,020
I was in the Nevada desert.

5302
05:28:00,020 --> 05:28:16,470
I'm I'm going to use the bathroom wash the name Nevada is
derived from Spanish covered in snow white is snow and snow

5303
05:28:16,470 --> 05:28:28,090
is exactly what I saw in that Nevada desert it froze my
blood white oh it's the first testing of the nuclear bomb

5304
05:28:28,090 --> 05:28:36,950
atomic test subject weren't you on bikini at all bikini
that's part of the reason i was drawn to you you and i are

5305
05:28:36,950 --> 05:28:48,250
alike we're both slowly being eaten away by the karma of
others we'll never have the chance to die peacefully of old

5306
05:28:48,250 --> 05:29:01,610
age we have no tomorrow but we can still have hope for the
future oh snake right there like MGS3 like original render

5307
05:29:01,610 --> 05:29:12,530
of him from space three years earlier the Soviet Union had
succeeded in launching Sputnik oh Sputnik made satellite in

5308
05:29:12,530 --> 05:29:22,830
history I know I know that this came as a real history real
real history Kojima made history it had into its own manned

5309
05:29:22,830 --> 05:29:25,450
spaceflight project the mercury program

5310
05:29:29,150 --> 05:29:31,630
seem poised to send their first man into space.

5311
05:29:32,550 --> 05:29:35,570
America was still experimenting with chimpanzees and
rockets.

5312
05:29:36,750 --> 05:29:37,310
Monkey.

5313
05:29:38,090 --> 05:29:38,610
Monkey.

5314
05:29:38,790 --> 05:29:40,510
The government wanted human data.

5315
05:29:42,370 --> 05:29:46,090
So they secretly decided to send a human being into space.

5316
05:29:47,070 --> 05:29:47,730
Who could that be?

5317
05:29:48,150 --> 05:29:50,150
I was the one they chose.

5318
05:29:50,370 --> 05:29:51,330
Oh my god.

5319
05:29:51,590 --> 05:29:52,210
Oh my god.

5320
05:29:52,350 --> 05:29:52,590
Her?

5321
05:29:53,450 --> 05:29:54,570
It's not Neal Armstrong?

5322
05:29:55,210 --> 05:29:55,810
It's not Neal Armstrong?

5323
05:29:56,350 --> 05:30:03,790
And whoever they sent up would inevitably be exposed to
heavy radiation that's why they chose me after all i'd

5324
05:30:03,790 --> 05:30:10,330
already been irradiated once of course you won't find any of
this oh that's why she can't have children i could see the

5325
05:30:10,330 --> 05:30:20,330
planet as it appeared from space that's when it finally came
space exploration is nothing but another game in the power

5326
05:30:20,330 --> 05:30:26,330
struggle between the u.s and the USSR politics economics the
arms race

5327
05:30:30,990 --> 05:30:38,910
I'm sure you can see that, but the Earth itself has no
boundaries, no East, no West, no Cold War.

5328
05:30:40,830 --> 05:30:47,410
And the irony of it is, the United States and the Soviet
Union are spending billions on their space programs and the

5329
05:30:47,410 --> 05:30:50,770
missile race, only to arrive at the same conclusion.

5330
05:30:52,490 --> 05:31:00,270
In the 21st century, everyone will be able to see that we
are all just inhabitants of a little celestial body called

5331
05:31:00,270 --> 05:31:14,580
earth a world without communism or capitalism that is the
world i wanted to see but reality continued to betray me

5332
05:31:18,320 --> 05:31:30,920
in 1961 i was sent to cuba to baye de cochinos it was part
of a cia sponsored invasion under the guise of taking cuban

5333
05:31:30,920 --> 05:31:39,840
exiles back to their country but the u.s government betrayed
them our weak need president held back their air support

5334
05:31:39,840 --> 05:31:51,200
defenseless the exiles were annihilated by the cuban army oh
all i could do was watch in silence no i was set up by the

5335
05:31:51,200 --> 05:32:02,200
very country i sacrificed so much by the very government i
dedicated my life to defending from the surface world and i

5336
05:32:02,200 --> 05:32:16,620
went underground then two years ago i faced the sorrow my
old comrade in battle oh oh i love it it was my friend and

5337
05:32:16,620 --> 05:32:29,120
but one of us had to die oh oh i was left with no choice oh
that was the skeleton i saw yeah it was him there is no

5338
05:32:29,120 --> 05:32:40,160
enmity between us one must live and one must die that was
the mission the mission the one who is the mission were the

5339
05:32:40,160 --> 05:32:51,020
philosophers Stanley early in the 20th century the true
holders of power in the United States the Republic of China

5340
05:32:51,020 --> 05:32:58,180
and the newly formed Soviet Union gathered together in a
secret meeting that would later be known as the Wiseman's

5341
05:32:58,180 --> 05:33:06,880
Committee the secret marked the beginning of the
philosophers but the last of the original members Thanos

5342
05:33:06,880 --> 05:33:20,940
Thanos Thanos oh my god and the wise men's committee
degenerate Thanos snap Thanos the philosophers of today have

5343
05:33:20,940 --> 05:33:32,980
no sense oh my god who else is Thanos oh snap Thanos they
have become war itself until there's no one left that's how

5344
05:33:32,980 --> 05:33:40,860
they operate the sacrifices of war cause a shift in the
times this shift leads to renewed conflict and in turn

5345
05:33:40,860 --> 05:33:48,720
triggers the next war like a nuclear chain reaction each
conflict sparks countless others forming an endless spiral

5346
05:33:48,720 --> 05:33:58,780
that will continue on for eternity do you understand what
I'm saying snake by consuming me and you the philosophers

5347
05:33:58,780 --> 05:34:13,660
intend to keep that cycle going did you see the little baby
yeah over there the right side oh her dad was oh you see i

5348
05:34:13,660 --> 05:34:23,600
am the last remaining child of the philosophers it's like so
sad but after he revealed the truth my father was killed by

5349
05:34:23,600 --> 05:34:24,960
that same shapeless

5350
05:34:29,700 --> 05:34:33,100
My father isn't the only thing the philosophers have taken
from me.

5351
05:34:35,680 --> 05:34:40,020
If all those philosophers are God, then how could they take
more?

5352
05:34:40,060 --> 05:34:41,800
I took part in the landing at Normandy.

5353
05:34:43,320 --> 05:34:48,800
We'd been given a top-secret mission to locate and destroy
enemy V-2 rocket installations.

5354
05:34:51,680 --> 05:34:53,660
I was pregnant at the time.

5355
05:34:55,280 --> 05:34:57,140
The sorrow was the father.

5356
05:34:59,700 --> 05:35:09,460
on the field of battle a beautiful baby boy oh my god that
is mummy but my child was snatched away from me by the

5357
05:35:09,460 --> 05:35:16,400
philosophers it should me or i should not wait

is our destiny the one who survives will inherit the title

5367
05:36:54,910 --> 05:36:58,490
of boss oh the one who inherits the

5368
05:37:04,970 --> 05:37:06,710

That's 10 minutes.

5373
05:37:15,110 --> 05:37:18,210
If you can get me in less than 10 minutes, you'll be able to
escape in time.

5374
05:37:20,330 --> 05:37:21,130
Oh, shit.

5375
05:37:21,350 --> 05:37:23,750
This is the greatest 10 minutes of our lives, Jack.

Alright.

5377
05:37:25,770 --> 05:37:27,390
Do I need a CQC here?

Why can't I see?

5407
05:40:03,290 --> 05:40:03,930
You gotta keep doing it.

5408
05:40:04,050 --> 05:40:21,270
gotta keep doing it no like like what it like there's no
prompts for it like you have to do it like in the cutscene

5409
05:40:21,270 --> 05:40:30,990
it's very strange I didn't even see it it doesn't it doesn't
appear it's a timing thing how do I know the timing you just

5410
05:40:30,990 --> 05:40:32,770
that's That's the issue.

5411
05:40:34,990 --> 05:40:35,490
I...

5412
05:40:35,490 --> 05:40:37,010
I pressed it.

5413
05:40:38,590 --> 05:40:39,350
It's hard.

5414
05:40:40,330 --> 05:40:40,830
I'm...

5415
05:40:40,830 --> 05:40:42,270
Do I press it or hold it?

5416
05:40:44,570 --> 05:40:46,530
Like, is it a press or a hold?

5417
05:40:46,990 --> 05:40:47,390
That's the thing.

5418
05:40:48,230 --> 05:40:48,730
It's...

5419
05:40:49,450 --> 05:40:50,390
You can get it.

5420
05:40:50,510 --> 05:40:51,430
Oh, you're getting hungry.

5421
05:40:51,790 --> 05:40:53,330
I'm getting hungry right now.

5422
05:40:53,790 --> 05:40:54,030
It's okay.

5423
05:40:54,110 --> 05:40:56,190
We'll keep doing it until it works, right?

5424
05:41:00,770 --> 05:41:01,550
Come on.

5425
05:41:01,810 --> 05:41:02,810
You can just feel it.

5426
05:41:02,810 --> 05:41:04,590
Just feel when you press it.

5427
05:41:05,670 --> 05:41:06,110
Um.

5428
05:41:06,810 --> 05:41:07,230
Oh.

5429
05:41:08,190 --> 05:41:10,270
I don't think I felt it.

5430
05:41:11,790 --> 05:41:12,530
It's okay.

5431
05:41:12,810 --> 05:41:14,230
She took apart, like, all your weapons.

5432
05:41:14,510 --> 05:41:14,850
No, no.

5433
05:41:14,870 --> 05:41:16,210
I still had, like, 20 more.

5434
05:41:16,350 --> 05:41:17,650
I still...

5435
05:41:17,650 --> 05:41:20,290
Just don't press until the slowdown.

5436
05:41:20,570 --> 05:41:20,670
Oh.

5437
05:41:22,370 --> 05:41:23,990
It's the same thing here, too, yeah.

5438
05:41:28,550 --> 05:41:28,990
I...

5439
05:41:28,990 --> 05:41:30,990
I like how you're trying to figure it out.

5440
05:41:31,470 --> 05:41:31,830
Yeah, yeah.

5441
05:41:31,890 --> 05:41:33,030
I'll figure this out.

5442
05:41:34,750 --> 05:41:35,630
Wait, what?

5443
05:41:36,850 --> 05:41:37,830
Wait, what?

5444
05:41:39,330 --> 05:41:40,290
You rolled into her.

5445
05:41:40,990 --> 05:41:41,850
Wait, I could do that?

5446
05:41:43,810 --> 05:41:45,670
She's just taking a nice look now.

5447
05:41:46,150 --> 05:41:46,190
Wait.

5448
05:41:47,050 --> 05:41:48,290
Wait, oh, shit.

5449
05:41:49,270 --> 05:41:49,950
Oh, shit.

5450
05:41:50,930 --> 05:41:51,230
Where is she?

5451
05:41:51,350 --> 05:41:51,470
Oh.

5452
05:41:52,650 --> 05:41:53,850
Oh, there she goes.

5453
05:41:54,310 --> 05:41:56,550
I like the sniper in this fight, but...

5454
05:41:56,550 --> 05:41:57,850
Is the sniper good for this fight?

5455
05:41:59,050 --> 05:42:02,270
Well, yeah, if you're hidden, but also...

5456
05:42:02,270 --> 05:42:02,690
Oh, no!

5457
05:42:02,970 --> 05:42:03,310
My snob!

5458
05:42:03,670 --> 05:42:04,730

5459
05:42:04,750 --> 05:42:05,590

5460
05:42:07,230 --> 05:42:07,710

5461
05:42:08,050 --> 05:42:08,610

05:42:13,610 --> 05:42:14,250
Okay.

5464
05:42:17,510 --> 05:42:19,730
I will never figure out CQC.

5465
05:42:20,790 --> 05:42:22,090
I will never figure...

5466
05:42:22,090 --> 05:42:23,650
She does not know the basics at all.

5467
05:42:23,750 --> 05:42:24,750
She doesn't know the basics.

5468
05:42:25,650 --> 05:42:25,970
Shooter!

5469
05:42:28,530 --> 05:42:30,330

05:44:23,220 --> 05:44:26,040
I see, though, the sniper for this is like...

5501
05:44:26,040 --> 05:44:26,640
There we go.

5502
05:44:26,940 --> 05:44:28,180
That's 1 HP, right?

5503
05:44:29,580 --> 05:44:30,020
Hmm.

5504
05:44:32,120 --> 05:44:32,560
Maybe.

5505
05:44:33,260 --> 05:44:35,160
Is that 1 HP or should I...

5506
05:44:35,160 --> 05:44:35,780
Shoot her again?

5507
05:44:36,620 --> 05:44:38,000
No, just... No, no, no.

5508
05:44:38,260 --> 05:44:39,540
Just chill for a bit.

5509
05:44:39,620 --> 05:44:39,940
Yeah?

5510
05:44:40,640 --> 05:44:41,080
Yeah.

5511
05:44:42,340 --> 05:44:42,780
Yeah.

5512
05:44:44,420 --> 05:44:46,700
She's not gonna get close to me, right?

5513
05:44:47,620 --> 05:44:47,880
No.

5514
05:44:48,400 --> 05:44:48,460
No?

5515
05:44:50,040 --> 05:44:51,700
Just taking everything.

5516
05:44:53,520 --> 05:44:54,960
The last fight.

5517
05:44:57,500 --> 05:44:58,660
Okay, now...

5518
05:44:59,260 --> 05:44:59,840
Now...

5519
05:44:59,840 --> 05:45:02,240
Come on, just let her get close a little.

5520
05:45:02,580 --> 05:45:03,580
She's getting...

5521
05:45:03,580 --> 05:45:05,620
She's getting a little too close right now.

5522
05:45:06,120 --> 05:45:07,660
Do the CQ so you can have those.

5523
05:45:10,420 --> 05:45:11,940
I don't... I don't know.

5524
05:45:13,340 --> 05:45:14,120
Just chill.

5525
05:45:14,260 --> 05:45:16,160
You got time.

5526
05:45:16,260 --> 05:45:16,780
You got time.

5527
05:45:18,020 --> 05:45:20,000
You got lots of time.

5537
05:45:45,180 --> 05:45:45,740

5565
05:48:12,150 --> 05:48:14,270
You don't want to kill her when the end of the song happens?

5566
05:48:15,050 --> 05:48:17,950
Oh, you just want to listen to Snake Heater.

5590
05:49:47,060 --> 05:49:47,900
There we go.

5591
05:49:52,720 --> 05:49:53,920
Don't do that.

5592
05:49:54,120 --> 05:49:54,560
Don't do that.

5593
05:49:54,980 --> 05:49:55,900
Don't do that.

5594
05:50:02,860 --> 05:50:04,920
Yeah, that was the best way to end it.

5595
05:50:06,940 --> 05:50:08,640
Not with the tea bagging.

5596
05:50:11,140 --> 05:50:13,120
I see QC there.

5597
05:50:18,990 --> 05:50:20,990

5614
05:52:51,740 --> 05:52:53,420
Oh, the snake is gone.

5615
05:52:54,940 --> 05:52:56,280
It becomes a snake.

5616
05:53:00,660 --> 05:53:01,520
Oh.

5617
05:53:17,400 --> 05:53:18,820
Yay, you beat the game!

05:53:24,000 --> 05:53:25,340
Oh, okay, not yet.

5620
05:53:25,740 --> 05:53:27,000
We still have more to go.

5621
05:53:27,880 --> 05:53:28,740
But no more gameplay.

5622
05:53:29,040 --> 05:53:30,520
Oh, okay, it's just cutscene, all right.

5623
05:53:30,960 --> 05:53:31,240
Yeah.

5624
05:53:33,360 --> 05:53:35,060
No, she beat the game, you guys.

5625
05:53:35,240 --> 05:53:37,780
This is where you would call time in a speed run.

5626
05:53:38,500 --> 05:53:38,900
Time.

5627
05:53:39,700 --> 05:53:39,980
Yeah.

5628
05:53:41,380 --> 05:53:43,680
And the SGDQD.

5629
05:53:45,180 --> 05:53:45,740
WCB.

5630
05:53:53,760 --> 05:53:54,560
Oh, I'm sorry.

5631
05:53:54,700 --> 05:53:55,960
There's one more gameplay.

5632
05:53:56,200 --> 05:53:56,980
You guys are right.

5633
05:53:57,080 --> 05:53:57,280
Fine.

5634
05:53:58,400 --> 05:53:59,180
Oh, my God.

5635
05:53:59,500 --> 05:54:00,960
There's one more.

5636
05:54:03,340 --> 05:54:04,900
I'm sorry, my mommy.

5637
05:54:12,760 --> 05:54:13,640
Mommy's dead.

5638
05:54:15,080 --> 05:54:15,940
Are you okay?

5639
05:54:16,420 --> 05:54:18,680
Like, as if he didn't have to kill her.

5640
05:54:19,960 --> 05:54:20,380
Oh.

5641
05:54:23,940 --> 05:54:25,360
Oh, it's white again.

5642
05:54:38,070 --> 05:54:39,230

Oh shit!

5651
05:56:01,850 --> 05:56:04,910
They are so close to kissing.

5652
05:56:09,970 --> 05:56:10,930
This is foreplay.

5653
05:56:11,850 --> 05:56:12,710
Yeah, absolutely.

5654
05:56:17,110 --> 05:56:17,910
Oh

05:56:31,660 --> 05:56:32,360
shit!

5656
05:56:38,460 --> 05:56:40,500
Fly the plane and they're making out.

5657
05:56:40,640 --> 05:56:43,420
Try to remember some of the basics of CQC.

5658
05:56:45,480 --> 05:56:46,520
That stance.

5659
05:56:46,900 --> 05:56:48,700
Oh, CQC time.

5660
05:56:51,260 --> 05:56:53,840
That's all he knows.

5661
05:56:56,440 --> 05:56:57,480
Oh, shit.

5662
05:56:59,300 --> 05:57:01,000
Yeah, so that was not smart.

5663
05:57:01,320 --> 05:57:02,520
Ocelot's too fat.

5664
05:57:04,180 --> 05:57:05,820
Somebody's Duffy has got to go.

5665
05:57:08,420 --> 05:57:09,320
Oh, shit.

5666
05:57:09,740 --> 05:57:10,800
Oh, no, reversal him.

05:57:13,940 --> 05:57:14,800
What the fuck?

5668
05:57:14,940 --> 05:57:16,540
Is that physically possible?

5669
05:57:19,020 --> 05:57:21,080
They're just dancing at this point.

5670
05:57:21,440 --> 05:57:25,180
I'm like, is that even humanly possible to do in the fight?

5671
05:57:27,100 --> 05:57:28,440
The fucking flip.

5672
05:57:29,900 --> 05:57:31,300
He tried to get him in the eye.

5673
05:57:31,900 --> 05:57:36,200

05:58:21,120 --> 05:58:22,880
One more shot.

5679
05:58:28,690 --> 05:58:30,530
Oh, the magic bullet.

5680
05:58:31,190 --> 05:58:32,630
One last showdown.

5681
05:58:36,210 --> 05:58:37,190
Yeah, all right.

5682
05:58:40,040 --> 05:58:41,510
The crock at me.

5683
05:58:42,010 --> 05:58:42,590
Every time.

5684
05:58:43,030 --> 05:58:43,470
Get to me.

5685
05:58:47,220 --> 05:58:48,570
All right, pay attention.

5686
05:58:49,210 --> 05:58:49,470
Okay.

5687
05:58:50,330 --> 05:58:51,170
Oh.

5688
05:58:52,570 --> 05:58:54,050
Snake's got his own moves.

5689
05:58:55,970 --> 05:58:57,590
He learned it just for him.

5690
05:58:58,550 --> 05:58:59,530
That's the left one.

5691
05:58:59,710 --> 05:58:59,910
All right.

5692
05:59:00,030 --> 05:59:00,430
R1.

5693
05:59:01,250 --> 05:59:01,310
Oh.

5694
05:59:05,130 --> 05:59:05,910
Oh, shit.

5695
05:59:06,510 --> 05:59:07,830
Oh, shit.

5696
05:59:11,190 --> 05:59:12,350
Oh, my God.

5697
05:59:14,390 --> 05:59:15,230
Okay.

5698
05:59:15,690 --> 05:59:16,250
Oh, man.

5699
05:59:24,430 --> 05:59:25,910
Okay, aww.

5700
05:59:26,490 --> 05:59:28,470
I love this game, man.

5701
05:59:29,370 --> 05:59:30,690
Crock Cat is such a...

5702
05:59:30,690 --> 05:59:31,530
Oh, shit.

5703
05:59:32,510 --> 05:59:34,050
I didn't do it.

5704
05:59:34,410 --> 05:59:36,890
The crock difficulty.

5705
05:59:38,350 --> 05:59:39,130
Not that name.

5706
05:59:40,030 --> 05:59:41,270
Your real name.

5707
05:59:41,590 --> 05:59:42,170
You're not a snake.

5708
05:59:42,870 --> 05:59:44,050
And I'm not an Ocelot.

5709
05:59:44,630 --> 05:59:45,830
Don't say that.

5710
05:59:46,290 --> 05:59:47,150
You are an Ocelot.

5711
05:59:47,670 --> 05:59:49,550
My name is Adamska.

5712
05:59:51,130 --> 05:59:51,870
Adamska!

5713
05:59:52,630 --> 05:59:54,950
I don't, Scott.

5714
05:59:55,950 --> 05:59:57,210
Drawing Metal Gear.

5715
05:59:58,150 --> 05:59:59,770
Drawing Metal Gear, yeah.

5716
06:00:02,090 --> 06:00:03,730
But I won't forget!

5717
06:00:08,310 --> 06:00:09,070
Sorry.

5718
06:00:11,530 --> 06:00:13,050
Come on!

5719
06:00:13,790 --> 06:00:15,930
All right, make the right choice.

5720
06:00:16,270 --> 06:00:25,410
You know, Oh, oh, now I took off the croc.

5721
06:00:28,610 --> 06:00:30,470
Now I took it off.

5722
06:00:30,470 --> 06:00:31,530
Now you can't have it.

5723
06:00:31,890 --> 06:00:32,950
Nothing left.

5724
06:00:33,490 --> 06:00:34,010
All right.

5725
06:00:34,670 --> 06:00:35,910
You can pick either one now.

5726
06:00:36,090 --> 06:00:36,910
Go left.

5727
06:00:41,310 --> 06:00:42,710
Okay, let's see.

5728
06:00:43,650 --> 06:00:44,230
Okay.

5729
06:00:46,010 --> 06:00:46,650
All right.

5730
06:00:46,850 --> 06:00:48,790
Oh, it's a showdown now.

5731
06:00:51,990 --> 06:00:52,610
Let's see.

5732
06:00:52,630 --> 06:00:54,710
You hard time.

5733
06:01:04,660 --> 06:01:06,140
A good old duel.

5734
06:01:06,980 --> 06:01:08,140
Yeah, poor Eva.

5735
06:01:16,100 --> 06:01:16,860
Do it.

5736
06:01:21,300 --> 06:01:22,540
Oh, it was me!

5737
06:01:22,920 --> 06:01:23,320
Yay!

5738
06:01:26,300 --> 06:01:28,480
Okay, I was not aiming there.

5739
06:01:28,640 --> 06:01:29,760
I'll just say that.

5740
06:01:37,770 --> 06:01:39,530
It's a blank.

5741
06:01:39,830 --> 06:01:40,050
What?

5742
06:01:41,470 --> 06:01:42,970
So there was no choice.

5743
06:01:43,670 --> 06:01:44,810
Choices don't matter!

5744
06:01:45,410 --> 06:01:46,250
This guy!

5745
06:01:49,530 --> 06:01:51,610
Just a prank, bro.

5746
06:01:51,890 --> 06:01:53,070
That was fun.

5747
06:01:54,410 --> 06:01:54,890
Why?

5748
06:01:56,110 --> 06:01:56,550
Alright.

5749
06:01:57,510 --> 06:01:58,670
See ya, but bro.

5750
06:01:58,910 --> 06:02:01,850
Now he's gonna do the dumbest thing I've ever seen him do.

5751
06:02:02,050 --> 06:02:02,570
Oh my god.

5752
06:02:03,390 --> 06:02:09,790
Also, I- You're not gonna- No, man, whatever it lives.

5753
06:02:14,550 --> 06:02:16,610
He's just like, nice.

5754
06:02:17,050 --> 06:02:19,770
He had his wrestling and he's fine now.

5755
06:02:20,270 --> 06:02:20,830
He's satisfied.

5756
06:02:21,230 --> 06:02:22,430
He's actually so stupid.

5757
06:02:26,270 --> 06:02:28,950
He's in the middle of the lake, you guys.

5758
06:02:31,070 --> 06:02:33,990
Bro, he's literally rolling on water, bro.

5759
06:02:34,010 --> 06:02:35,230
He's running on water.

5760
06:02:35,730 --> 06:02:36,330
Jesus.

5761
06:02:37,590 --> 06:02:39,590
The second coming of Christ.

5762
06:02:40,150 --> 06:02:43,370
She's just been going in circles trying to keep the plane
up.

5763
06:02:46,450 --> 06:02:46,970
Yay!

5764
06:02:51,800 --> 06:02:52,920
Okay, now you're done.

5765
06:02:57,760 --> 06:02:58,800
So funny.

5766
06:02:59,960 --> 06:03:01,440
It's like such a good scene.

5767
06:03:02,240 --> 06:03:06,920
He was like, now that I have my personal time with my
boyfriend, I leave now.

5768
06:03:07,420 --> 06:03:07,680
Yeah.

5769
06:03:07,820 --> 06:03:08,320
We made it.

5770
06:03:08,580 --> 06:03:10,080
Yeah, we sure did.

5771
06:03:19,380 --> 06:03:19,980
Aww.

5772
06:03:21,120 --> 06:03:24,740
That's actually crazy that Ocelot brought the plane weight
down.

5773
06:03:25,360 --> 06:03:26,600
I know.

5774
06:03:27,880 --> 06:03:30,000
He is the thousand pound man.

5775
06:03:30,380 --> 06:03:30,380
Yeah.

5776
06:03:30,780 --> 06:03:32,940
Also, what are we gonna do with that horse?

5777
06:03:33,220 --> 06:03:35,500
Like, did we just left the horse there?

5778
06:03:35,780 --> 06:03:36,720
Yeah, we just leave the horse.

5779
06:03:38,040 --> 06:03:41,740
That's a domestic- Ocelot's ego is like 500 pounds away.

5780
06:03:42,940 --> 06:03:46,000
No, his gun alone is like 100 pounds.

5781
06:03:46,540 --> 06:03:46,940
Yeah.

5782
06:03:49,100 --> 06:03:49,760
Uh-oh.

5783
06:03:50,280 --> 06:03:50,880
Uh-oh.

5784
06:03:50,940 --> 06:03:52,020
There's no way out.

5785
06:03:52,520 --> 06:03:53,260
What are we gonna do?

5786
06:03:54,040 --> 06:03:56,940
We've come too far to let them stop us now.

5787
06:04:00,800 --> 06:04:02,080
Those things have got to be armed.

5788
06:04:02,400 --> 06:04:03,200
It's no use.

5789
06:04:03,300 --> 06:04:05,200
There's no way we can outmaneuver them.

5790
06:04:07,360 --> 06:04:07,840
Unless?

5791
06:04:10,040 --> 06:04:11,500
They're gonna shoot us down.

5792
06:04:12,420 --> 06:04:13,580
We were so close.

5793
06:04:14,260 --> 06:04:15,000
They were so close.

5794
06:04:15,000 --> 06:04:15,700
Weapons systems on.

5795
06:04:16,260 --> 06:04:17,280
Locked on targets.

5796
06:04:17,400 --> 06:04:17,680
Wait.

5797
06:04:17,680 --> 06:04:19,080
They sound American.

5798
06:04:21,020 --> 06:04:22,900
You were great, Eva.

5799
06:04:23,660 --> 06:04:25,040
Everybody has sounded American.

5800
06:04:41,830 --> 06:04:43,430
We did it!

5801
06:04:44,630 --> 06:04:47,250
Oh, I think they realized they're not getting paid.

5802
06:04:48,690 --> 06:04:50,050
I didn't realize now.

5803
06:04:51,110 --> 06:04:52,850
They're like, oh, the commander's dead.

5804
06:04:53,650 --> 06:04:55,650
Oh, probably, yeah.

5805
06:04:56,590 --> 06:04:56,690
Yeah.

5806
06:04:56,690 --> 06:04:58,810
They were like, they told me to shut down.

5807
06:05:00,190 --> 06:05:00,490
Look!

5808
06:05:09,340 --> 06:05:10,180
Just a prank.

5809
06:05:10,860 --> 06:05:11,580
Oh, nice.

5810
06:05:11,920 --> 06:05:12,280
Yay!

5811
06:05:12,400 --> 06:05:13,520
They just want a kiss.

5812
06:05:13,760 --> 06:05:15,060
They just want a kiss.

5813
06:05:16,020 --> 06:05:17,460
Oh, my God.

5814
06:05:17,560 --> 06:05:19,060
Oh, he's blocked.

5815
06:05:19,440 --> 06:05:19,780
Always blocked.

5816
06:05:19,800 --> 06:05:20,380
Always blocked.

5817
06:05:21,240 --> 06:05:21,520
Again.

5818
06:05:22,780 --> 06:05:23,340
Again.

5819
06:05:23,760 --> 06:05:24,100
Oh.

5820
06:05:24,840 --> 06:05:26,500
The MiG's disengaged.

5821
06:05:26,980 --> 06:05:28,660
Most likely under orders from Khrushchev.

5822
06:05:29,280 --> 06:05:30,560
Is this his way of helping us?

5823
06:05:30,680 --> 06:05:36,940
Who knows maybe he didn't want things to get messier than
they already are or maybe he just wanted us to owe him one

5824
06:05:36,940 --> 06:05:39,860
The important thing is you made it out alive.

5825
06:05:39,860 --> 06:05:48,660
I did it Yippee yay It should be smooth sailing all the way
to Alaska croc block someone out to Galina base to meet you

Langley Don't keep them waiting.

5827
06:05:55,860 --> 06:05:59,220
Yeah, no President wants to see us

5828
06:06:07,780 --> 06:06:08,900
Alaska hole.

5829
06:06:11,680 --> 06:06:13,800
I'm gonna get a medal of honor.

5830
06:06:15,460 --> 06:06:16,860
There's still so much cutscene.

5831
06:06:17,220 --> 06:06:17,900
I'm sorry.

5832
06:06:19,100 --> 06:06:19,980
I'm really sorry.

All right, Kojumbo.

He finally hit puberty.

06:08:16,470 --> 06:08:17,290
She was looking at me.

5862
06:08:17,990 --> 06:08:20,590
Oh, cock blocks again.

5863
06:08:21,170 --> 06:08:21,670
Nah.

5864
06:08:24,170 --> 06:08:26,170
I'm just crying.

5865
06:08:27,930 --> 06:08:29,390
Aslak, don't knock.

5866
06:08:30,590 --> 06:08:31,510
Oh, shit.

5867
06:08:31,650 --> 06:08:34,230
Wait, that's the government paid for that.

5868
06:08:34,990 --> 06:08:35,530
That's fine.

5869
06:08:37,330 --> 06:08:40,210
She's like, Shake, there's a bushel coming here!

5870
06:08:43,850 --> 06:08:45,430
Oh my god!

5871
06:08:45,650 --> 06:08:47,210
Oh my god!

5872
06:08:47,730 --> 06:08:52,250
That was not the smartest thing that Eva did.

5873
06:08:57,750 --> 06:08:58,890
Okay, sexy time is over.

5874
06:09:00,770 --> 06:09:03,310
Damn, oh my god, look at all those veins.

5875
06:09:04,010 --> 06:09:05,630
Look at all those wounds!

5876
06:09:06,210 --> 06:09:07,250
Oh my god.

5877
06:09:13,510 --> 06:09:14,530
Good morning.

5878
06:09:14,690 --> 06:09:15,010
Snake.

5879
06:09:15,290 --> 06:09:15,650
Good morning.

5880
06:09:15,970 --> 06:09:16,330
A snake.

5881
06:09:20,950 --> 06:09:22,270
What's wrong with this tummy?

5882
06:09:22,410 --> 06:09:23,650
What you do to him?

5883
06:09:23,790 --> 06:09:25,590
What the fuck is wrong?

5884
06:09:25,910 --> 06:09:26,010
What?

5885
06:09:27,090 --> 06:09:28,590
Okay, what did you do to him?

5886
06:09:29,810 --> 06:09:33,070
It's like a giant ass hickey on the stomach.

5887
06:09:33,750 --> 06:09:34,110
Oh my god.

5888
06:09:35,110 --> 06:09:39,530
But she was just like vacuuming the stomach.

5889
06:09:40,910 --> 06:09:42,090
Okay, here's important Lord.

5890
06:09:42,110 --> 06:10:01,650
dump fruit of knowledge forgive me snake ah she took the
philosophy goodbye one night stand oh

5891
06:10:07,620 --> 06:10:12,360
snake is always getting played by someone man oh man snake

5892
06:10:22,510 --> 06:10:30,090
she took his kidney it looks like it looks like she took his
kidneys are it

5893
06:10:33,670 --> 06:10:47,810
jesus christ he's a heavy sleeper i wasn't sent by cruise
ship i'm not a kgb spy and i know i'm an agent of the

5894
06:10:47,810 --> 06:11:00,150
people's republic of china the third party

5895
06:11:03,450 --> 06:11:05,730
Never would have expected it.

5896
06:11:05,850 --> 06:11:06,970
Oh my god.

5897
06:11:07,890 --> 06:11:08,970
She's Chinese?

5898
06:11:13,110 --> 06:11:17,950
You know that video where it was like, he's actually
Chinese.

5899
06:11:18,170 --> 06:11:18,710
You know this?

5900
06:11:19,830 --> 06:11:22,850
Wait, you did not heard of that video before?

5901
06:11:23,370 --> 06:11:25,510
Oh, there were philosophers in China.

5902
06:11:27,070 --> 06:11:27,410
Yeah.

5903
06:11:28,550 --> 06:11:31,510
So I infiltrated his base as a K-2.

5904
06:11:32,890 --> 06:11:45,310
The two NSA code breakers who defected in 1960 Were actually
both men The real Adam never showed up at the meeting place

5905
06:11:47,610 --> 06:11:58,290
Saving me the trouble of having to eliminate him I sneaked
in by pretending I was Eva That's why she didn't know The

5906
06:11:58,290 --> 06:12:05,770
Yorolala Rala Ba La la la la lilo

5907
06:12:09,150 --> 06:12:17,990
I knew it I was like you know she didn't know The Chinese
government had its eye in the legacy too But she was hot

5908
06:12:17,990 --> 06:12:27,330
we've just trusted her And also the nuclear missile launched
data from the shagohad Oh my god well she got too many

5909
06:12:27,330 --> 06:12:34,070
things The Soviet Union stopped supplying us with nuclear
weapons technology Since then, China's Leon Don easing.

5910
06:12:34,310 --> 06:12:36,350
Yeah, Toki, you don't know the password either.

5911
06:12:37,810 --> 06:12:40,250
Yeah, but I'm not part of the government.

5912
06:12:41,570 --> 06:12:44,470
We'll create a deterrent force to rival those of the U.S.

5913
06:12:44,490 --> 06:12:45,070
and Soviet Union.

5914
06:12:45,170 --> 06:12:47,690
That color is not the color that was on the back of that
thing.

5915
06:12:48,450 --> 06:12:49,530
Thanks to your help.

5916
06:12:53,680 --> 06:12:55,200
I, too, am one of the philosophers.

5917
06:12:56,900 --> 06:13:00,200
I'm an agent of the philosophers, a graduate of one of their
charm schools.

5918
06:13:00,420 --> 06:13:01,220
Charm schools?

5919
06:13:01,940 --> 06:13:03,760
I was raised in a joint U.S.-Soviet China.

5920
06:13:03,860 --> 06:13:04,940
He's like a honeypot.

5921
06:13:08,060 --> 06:13:08,900
Charm school.

5922
06:13:08,900 --> 06:13:11,400
Back then, they were collecting children from all over the
world.

5923
06:13:12,560 --> 06:13:15,740
As a result, I'm indistinguishable from a native-born
American.

5924
06:13:16,480 --> 06:13:19,300
So it didn't surprise me when you and Vulgan couldn't tell
the difference.

5925
06:13:21,080 --> 06:13:23,340
But she knew right from the beginning.

5926
06:13:24,620 --> 06:13:29,500
She knew because before the war, she was at one of the
philosopher's schools too as an instructor.

5927
06:13:30,700 --> 06:13:31,400
The boss.

5928
06:13:31,400 --> 06:13:33,320
My boss was the only one I couldn't fool.

5929
06:13:34,280 --> 06:13:34,320
Yep.

5930
06:13:34,860 --> 06:13:37,020
She was the only one who knew I was a fake.

5931
06:13:39,160 --> 06:13:40,960
She told me everything.

5932
06:13:43,100 --> 06:13:44,900
Why did she open her heart to me like that?

5933
06:13:45,440 --> 06:13:45,940
Wait!

5934
06:13:46,220 --> 06:13:48,120
At the time, I couldn't understand it.

5935
06:13:48,160 --> 06:13:48,520
Mommy?

5936
06:13:49,460 --> 06:13:51,780
But now, I think I do.

5937
06:13:52,460 --> 06:13:53,140
Oh, Snake.

5938
06:13:54,760 --> 06:13:56,900
She wanted you to know the truth.

5939
06:13:58,400 --> 06:14:00,460
She chose me to tell you.

5940
06:14:02,480 --> 06:14:04,400
That's why she saved my life.

5941
06:14:06,500 --> 06:14:09,380
I've lied to you so many times, but not this time.

5942
06:14:10,840 --> 06:14:13,340
My orders from the government were to obtain the legacy.

5943
06:14:13,840 --> 06:14:16,020
Holy shit, the fuck did you sit through all that?

5944
06:14:18,420 --> 06:14:19,180
Drugged his drink.

5945
06:14:21,260 --> 06:14:21,360
Oh.

5946
06:14:23,900 --> 06:14:25,520
I thought he was just tired.

5947
06:14:26,260 --> 06:14:27,120
He could be too.

5948
06:14:27,440 --> 06:14:28,420
Maybe he's some sleep.

5949
06:14:28,980 --> 06:14:29,580
Yeah, yeah.

5950
06:14:33,830 --> 06:14:37,150
All everyone does just lie to him.

5951
06:14:38,030 --> 06:14:41,110
And not because you saved my life.

5952
06:14:43,350 --> 06:14:45,390
But because I made a promise to the boss.

5953
06:14:47,010 --> 06:14:48,990
And I intend to keep it.

5954
06:14:50,470 --> 06:14:53,070
But you know, the saving your life thing is pretty important
too.

5955
06:14:53,370 --> 06:14:54,350
Yeah, and you know.

5956
06:14:55,490 --> 06:14:59,210
He did, you know, wash you limp for like two force levels.

5957
06:15:06,630 --> 06:15:07,930
Poor Snake.

5958
06:15:07,970 --> 06:15:08,810
Poor Snake.

5959
06:15:09,390 --> 06:15:10,550
Always getting deceived.

5960
06:15:10,810 --> 06:15:12,410
He got lied to by...

5961
06:15:12,410 --> 06:15:14,650
She's always self-destructs.

5962
06:15:14,770 --> 06:15:15,170
Yeah.

5963
06:15:15,590 --> 06:15:17,550
Like the good old spy movies.

5964
06:15:17,970 --> 06:15:19,290
That's this whole game.

5965
06:15:22,090 --> 06:15:23,470
Everybody's a spy.

5966
06:15:25,070 --> 06:15:25,210
Snake.

5967
06:15:26,010 --> 06:15:27,770
Should have picked us a lot.

5968
06:15:28,210 --> 06:15:29,450
She didn't betray the United States.

5969
06:15:30,850 --> 06:15:31,090
No.

5970
06:15:32,090 --> 06:15:33,090
Far from it.

5971
06:15:33,550 --> 06:15:35,710
She was a hero who died for her country.

5972
06:15:36,630 --> 06:15:38,290
It's the famous scene.

5973
06:15:38,930 --> 06:15:41,150
I know this Metal Gear reference.

5974
06:15:41,510 --> 06:15:48,370
I would hold

5975
06:15:52,710 --> 06:15:53,890
R1 here.

5976
06:15:59,010 --> 06:16:01,070
Holy shit, that is fortunes.

5977
06:16:01,750 --> 06:16:03,090
Oh my god, it is.

5978
06:16:05,190 --> 06:16:06,010
She's so cute.

5979
06:16:10,300 --> 06:16:13,180
You are above even the boss.

5980
06:16:14,060 --> 06:16:15,420
I hereby award you.

5981
06:16:15,440 --> 06:16:17,560
Big boss!

5982
06:16:18,600 --> 06:16:20,880
I got it!

5983
06:16:22,480 --> 06:16:23,500
At what cost?

5984
06:16:25,640 --> 06:16:27,900
You are a true patriot.

5985
06:16:29,120 --> 06:16:30,500
La la lo lo lo lo.

5986
06:16:36,970 --> 06:16:38,910
Oh, look to the left.

5987
06:16:39,950 --> 06:16:41,030
What the?

5988
06:16:43,390 --> 06:16:45,390
What is he...

5989
06:16:45,390 --> 06:16:49,010
What is he doing there?

5990
06:16:49,590 --> 06:17:04,130
I'm just imagining like is his boyfriend like he's just
imagining his boyfriend right it's like I wish he was here

5991
06:17:04,130 --> 06:17:08,150
to watch me get this award

5992
06:17:12,250 --> 06:17:14,250
oh this guy sucks

5993
06:17:22,910 --> 06:17:25,470
He actually lives for it free.

5994
06:17:28,550 --> 06:17:33,230
Someone like him to handle our top secret sneaking missions
for us.

5995
06:17:34,130 --> 06:17:36,450
A man who combines the qualities of a soldier and an agent.

5996
06:17:37,910 --> 06:17:41,170
The boss's defection was a ruse set up by the U.S.

5997
06:17:41,350 --> 06:17:41,530
government.

5998
06:17:45,710 --> 06:17:54,490
so they could get their hands on the philosopher's legacy
and the boss knows the story of the show see she was a

5999
06:17:54,490 --> 06:18:03,710
double agent and destroy the shagohad at the same time only
a legendary hero like the boss could have earned vulgan's

6000
06:18:03,710 --> 06:18:10,470
trust finding out where the philosopher's legacy was hidden
was to be her greatest mission everything was going

6001
06:18:10,470 --> 06:18:16,670
according to plan and then but then one could have
predicted.

6002
06:18:18,290 --> 06:18:22,710
Colonel Volgan fired an American-made nuclear warhead at
Sokolov's research facility.

6003
06:18:24,550 --> 06:18:26,230
Krutzev demanded by the U.S.

6004
06:18:26,430 --> 06:18:28,270
government to provide proof that it wasn't involved.

6005
06:18:29,550 --> 06:18:32,170
They couldn't just abort the operation to steal the legacy.

6006
06:18:33,990 --> 06:18:37,270
So the operation itself was greatly expanded and revised.

6007
06:18:39,350 --> 06:18:41,170
I don't think the crew got the memo.

6008
06:18:42,830 --> 06:18:45,470
I literally think they just told her our name.

6009
06:18:46,210 --> 06:18:47,930
The others were just like, yes, man.

6010
06:18:47,930 --> 06:18:49,610
And that one of their own would have to do the job.

6011
06:18:50,210 --> 06:18:50,670
The end.

6012
06:18:51,210 --> 06:18:53,450
The public couldn't be allowed to find out about it.

6013
06:18:53,990 --> 06:18:54,670
Not ever.

6014
06:18:56,590 --> 06:19:00,070
This they concluded would be the best way to keep the whole
thing under wraps.

6015
06:19:03,290 --> 06:19:05,390
The boss wouldn't be allowed to come back home alive.

6016
06:19:06,230 --> 06:19:08,410
And she wouldn't be allowed to kill herself.

6017
06:19:09,750 --> 06:19:12,630
Her life would be ended by her most beloved disciple.

6018
06:19:13,890 --> 06:19:15,430
It was all scripted.

6019
06:19:15,710 --> 06:19:17,830
That was the way the government wanted it.

6020
06:19:18,670 --> 06:19:20,090
That was the mission she was given.

6021
06:19:20,750 --> 06:19:23,590
And she had no choice but to carry it out.

6022
06:19:24,430 --> 06:19:26,150
Because she loved her country.

6023
06:19:26,670 --> 06:19:27,010
Oh!

6024
06:19:29,850 --> 06:19:32,990
Out of duty, she turned her back on her own comrades.

6025
06:19:34,450 --> 06:19:37,150
A lesser woman would have been crushed by such a burden.

6026
06:19:39,410 --> 06:19:42,770
The taint of disgrace will follow her to her grave.

6027
06:19:45,710 --> 06:19:48,210
The future generations will revile her.

6028
06:19:50,170 --> 06:19:51,730
The world never changes.

6029
06:19:51,730 --> 06:19:54,130
In America as a despicable traitor with no sense of honor.

6030
06:19:55,490 --> 06:19:58,470
And in Russia as a monster who unleashed a nuclear
catastrophe.

6031
06:20:01,210 --> 06:20:05,070
She will go down in official history as a war criminal.

6032
06:20:07,390 --> 06:20:09,130
And no one will ever understand her.

6033
06:20:11,890 --> 06:20:14,450
That was her final mission.

6034
06:20:16,730 --> 06:20:20,350
And like a true soldier, she saw it through to the end.

6035
06:20:23,470 --> 06:20:27,710
But I think she wanted you, of all people, to know the
truth.

6036
06:20:31,430 --> 06:20:35,330
She wanted to live on in your memory.

6037
06:20:38,210 --> 06:20:42,290
Not as a soldier, but as a woman.

6038
06:20:47,190 --> 06:20:49,830
She was forbidden to tell you herself.

6039
06:20:52,690 --> 06:20:53,930
That's why she told me.

6040
06:20:59,730 --> 06:21:03,690
Snake, history will never know what she did.

6041
06:21:05,210 --> 06:21:07,150
No one will ever learn the truth.

6042
06:21:08,570 --> 06:21:14,670
Her story, her debriefing, will endure only in your heart.

6043
06:21:21,010 --> 06:21:32,570
everything she did she did for her country she sacrificed
her life and her honor for her native land she was a real

6044
06:21:32,570 --> 06:21:52,270
hero she was a true patriot oh seven oh seven oh seven oh
it's shaky blurry vision

6045
06:22:06,250 --> 06:22:29,170
history history diva disappears oh the spans fox oh and then
they became the patriots establishes foxhound oh

6046

6063
06:24:13,280 --> 06:24:22,140
Kojima Kojima Kojima oh okay i thought it would be like
mostly Kojima Yoji Sinkawa is the other guy that's like

yeah what do you think of the story or like just like like
It was, yeah.

6066
06:24:36,640 --> 06:24:41,720
It feels like Kojima definitely had a lot of fun writing
this.

6067
06:24:43,940 --> 06:24:45,920
He had a blast.

6068
06:24:46,620 --> 06:24:47,140
Yeah.

6069
06:24:49,620 --> 06:24:50,380

So good.

6071
06:25:00,060 --> 06:25:01,340
Now you gotta play the other games.

6072
06:25:01,480 --> 06:25:02,560
It was truly cinema.

6073
06:25:03,540 --> 06:25:03,960
Yes.

6074
06:25:03,960 --> 06:25:20,580
really was I get it I think definitely I think from from all
the streams my favorite part was when we were like R1 while

6075
06:25:20,580 --> 06:25:30,800
he was flipping the guns and then the giant crocodile was
there and I was like I don't think we're gonna make it I

6076
06:25:34,080 --> 06:25:35,740
It's so good.

6077
06:25:36,540 --> 06:25:41,120
You guys, I can't make Doki play the rest of the games, but
if Doki has another Donothod.

6078
06:25:41,760 --> 06:25:44,060
That's why you'd be at charity auctions?

6079
06:25:44,440 --> 06:25:45,620
Yeah, at a charity auction.

6080
06:25:45,820 --> 06:25:46,620
That's what it was, yeah.

6081
06:25:46,940 --> 06:25:48,740
That's my Donothodod.

6082
06:26:01,000 --> 06:26:02,400

Yeah.

6099
06:27:47,100 --> 06:27:51,900
I was, like, debating, it was either big boss or, like,
snake or, or Ocelot.

6100
06:27:53,000 --> 06:27:53,760
It was one or two.

6101
06:27:53,760 --> 06:27:54,360
Oh, yeah, yeah.

6102
06:27:54,640 --> 06:28:01,080
No, like, snake, uh, naked snake is not, like, her actual
child.

6103
06:28:01,760 --> 06:28:01,860
Yeah.

6104
06:28:01,860 --> 06:28:03,860

because you're like mentor, you know.

6106
06:28:06,640 --> 06:28:09,520
Yeah, it was like, you are like a son to me.

6107
06:28:09,940 --> 06:28:14,420
Yeah, there is like a codec in this game that kind of
implies it.

6108
06:28:14,820 --> 06:28:20,460
So, but yeah, also it does look like the boss, too.

6109
06:28:21,460 --> 06:28:23,320
He looks like the boss and the sorrow.

6110
06:28:26,000 --> 06:28:29,480
Wait, what was that co-op Metal Gear game that was really
good?

6111
06:28:30,040 --> 06:28:33,440
Was the Peace Walker, the really good one that everyone
loves?

6112
06:28:34,060 --> 06:28:36,440
Um, it's really good, I agree.

6113
06:28:36,980 --> 06:28:38,420
Yeah, yeah, that's what it is.

6114
06:28:40,060 --> 06:28:41,960
No, you know what I'm talking about.

6115
06:28:42,140 --> 06:28:43,620
You're adding a really good one.

6116
06:28:43,960 --> 06:28:44,580
Oh, yeah.

6117
06:28:44,840 --> 06:28:45,120

06:28:45,880 --> 06:28:46,740
Oh, yeah.

6119
06:28:46,920 --> 06:28:52,080
There is, there is, like, a fox hunt in this game that's
online.

6120
06:28:53,580 --> 06:28:55,500
So you can play with people, too.

6121
06:28:56,320 --> 06:28:57,400
Oh, I see.

6122
06:28:58,060 --> 06:28:58,500
Yeah.

6123
06:28:59,420 --> 06:29:01,740
That's the, Peace Walker's the zombie one, right?

6124
06:29:02,660 --> 06:29:03,940
No, that survived.

6125
06:29:03,960 --> 06:29:06,340
Oh, why don't we play that?

6126
06:29:06,840 --> 06:29:08,260

06:29:11,600 --> 06:29:12,480
Isn't that the really good?

6129
06:29:12,600 --> 06:29:13,960
Wait, you're a Metal Gear...

6130
06:29:14,660 --> 06:29:17,960
You're the Metal Gear Vtuber, you haven't played Survive.

either.

6132
06:29:22,080 --> 06:29:23,140
Wait, which one was it?

6133
06:29:24,160 --> 06:29:26,960

6134
06:29:27,320 --> 06:29:27,760
Survive.

6135
06:29:28,220 --> 06:29:28,620
Oh!

6136
06:29:28,820 --> 06:29:33,200

were bullshitting, but...

6137
06:29:35,040 --> 06:29:37,080
Okay, that was a really good game.

6138
06:29:37,280 --> 06:29:38,000
Here's the extra scene.

6139
06:29:39,380 --> 06:29:43,960
Yes, Grozny Grad and the Grannon research facility have both
been wiped out without a trace.

6140
06:29:46,000 --> 06:29:46,840
The horse!

6142
06:29:53,200 --> 06:29:56,020
Yes, the CIA has taken care of the boss themselves.

6143
06:29:59,820 --> 06:30:01,620
I believe the White House will be satisfied.

6144
06:30:04,280 --> 06:30:05,300

6193
06:35:16,190 --> 06:35:21,530
At this point, let me tell you, it's like watching the Lord
of the Rings with somebody.

6194
06:35:23,230 --> 06:35:28,830
He was like, did you know that Gandalf was actually a film
separately from the hospital?

6195
06:35:29,890 --> 06:35:33,550
Did you know that he actually broke his hand in this scene?

6196
06:35:33,730 --> 06:35:36,250
His screams of pain were real.

6197
06:35:38,730 --> 06:35:41,010
Did you know the giant eagles were real?

6198
06:35:42,790 --> 06:35:45,050
He actually found them in New Zealand.

6199
06:35:46,230 --> 06:35:47,610
He broke his foot.

6200
06:35:48,050 --> 06:35:48,830
It was tough.

6201
06:35:49,390 --> 06:35:51,350
It's so...

6202
06:35:51,350 --> 06:35:53,390
They actually threw a man in a volcano.

6203
06:35:53,650 --> 06:35:54,250
Did you know that?

6204
06:35:57,370 --> 06:36:03,190
Nobody was harmed in the making of this film except for
everybody except for that one guy they threw in the volcano

6205
06:36:03,190 --> 06:36:16,570
all the people that were killed on screen we're actually
killed now you understand all of these cut scenes yeah i was
