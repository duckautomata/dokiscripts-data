00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:57,970
Hellooo everybody!

2
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,170
Hello, hello!

3
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,950
They couldn't hear you because I had Discord muted by the way, now they can.

4
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:09,910
Hello guys!

5
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,650
So first off...

6
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:15,930
At first, I was waiting for Gumi...

7
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,870
You didn't download the game!

8
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,390
You didn't download the game!

9
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,770
I said at first!

10
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,270
You didn't let me finish the sentence!

11
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:26,650
It's okay.

12
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,950
Anyway, at first...

13
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:32,150
I was waiting for Gumi before I got really interrupted.

14
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:44,490
Anyway, and then...

15
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,430
And then I realized I didn't install the game.

16
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:55,250
I thought she would take a little longer.

17
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:58,070
So I can use that as an excuse for a bit longer.

18
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:01,370
I told you 10 minutes and I joined at 10 minutes.

19
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,450
No, no, no, no.

20
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,130
You... okay.

21
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,610
No, no, no.

22
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:05,770
Wait, you did.

23
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:06,810
I misremembered.

24
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,030
I thought you said 15 minutes.

25
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:10,570
So I thought... It doesn't matter!

26
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:12,110
I apparently needed 20 minutes.

27
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:15,590
To install 44 gigabytes, by the way.

28
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:18,470
Holy shit, why is this game 44 gigabytes?

29
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,290
Why is this game so fucking huge?

30
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:24,510
We literally talked about how it's 15 hours long.

31
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:30,650
Yeah, but there's some games that aren't that long that isn't 44 gigabytes.

32
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,810
It's a fucking long game.

33
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,010
It's a huge game.

34
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:40,670
But anyway, it took me 20 minutes to install and it takes 2.

35
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,610
We were talking earlier on.

36
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,210
We were talking about...

37
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,090
How we don't want this child.

38
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,530
Because in Gumi's words...

39
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,610
In Gumi's words...

40
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,390
She thinks our kid's ugly.

41
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,930
I never said that!

42
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,510
Then why don't you want this child?

43
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:04,810
What the hell?

44
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:05,290
I don't want...

45
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,410
You said the child's ugly!

46
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:12,790
Dude, the child who wants cereal and cereal is $8!

47
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:17,330
You didn't even know it was $8 until I told you it was $8!

48
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,430
You were the one who wanted the child beforehand!

49
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,830
You can't buy the cereal while looking at the price.

50
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,250
This is why we're getting a divorce.

51
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,130
You don't look at prices.

52
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,470
No, it's just I don't buy cereal.

53
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:25,810
You don't look at prices.

54
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,070
I look at prices.

55
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,270
I just don't eat cereal.

56
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,730
Yeah, then why did you buy cereal for a child?

57
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,830
I'll buy it if she wants it because I'm a good parent.

58
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:36,430
But if she...

59
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,590
I don't want her!

60
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:46,470
Okay, all of us say a good parent wouldn't say I don't want her.

61
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:47,570
Like...

62
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:48,770
That's...

63
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:52,250
That's...

64
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,190
That is...

65
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:53,830
Bro...

66
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:57,650
Are you really going to say you're a good parent after that?

67
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:58,870
You're winning this case.

68
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:59,610
You're winning this case.

69
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:00,190
You can have her.

70
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,570
Hey, you can have her.

71
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:02,450
I mean...

72
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:03,490
No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait.

73
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:08,630
You're trying to purposely be a bad mom so the court wouldn't give you the child.

74
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,170
That's fucked up.

75
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,770
You wanted the child, not me.

76
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:14,870
Wait.

77
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,370
Who's playing husband?

78
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,010
Who's playing wife?

79
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:17,570
I'm playing husband.

80
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:18,870
Okay.

81
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:19,930
Look at us.

82
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,230
Who's going to be playing the husband if you let me?

83
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:22,910
Look at us.

84
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,110
It's not you.

85
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,090
I'm pretty sure you don't have a big dick.

86
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,070
I'm sending you a photo of...

87
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,590
I'm sending you a photo of mine too?

88
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,350
Hey guys.

89
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:38,930
Do you guys want to see the picture?

90
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:39,230
Hold on.

91
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,170
Discord.

92
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,430
Upload a file.

93
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,070
Hey guys.

94
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,770
Do you guys want to see the picture?

95
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,370
I'm going to send her.

96
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:50,330
Alright.

97
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,330
I'm going to need this.

98
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:51,950
Alright.

99
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:52,210
I'm going to need this.

100
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,090
I'm sending you this.

101
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:56,510
I am not sending that to chat.

102
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,270
But...

103
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:57,930
Wait.

104
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,270
I am not...

105
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,650
I think mine is bigger.

106
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,510
Mine is bigger but yours is faster.

107
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,450
Yours is attached.

108
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,810
Mine is part of the body.

109
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,970
It is not part of the body.

110
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,110
That's a rat.

111
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:11,670
Guys.

112
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,270
This is part of the body.

113
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,130
This is...

114
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:16,810
It's a fucking rat.

115
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,230
Don't say that about him.

116
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,450
He gets sensitive.

117
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,010
I know you are working through this.

118
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,470
I get sensitive.

119
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,930
He gets sensitive.

120
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,330
Don't say that.

121
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,430
He's going to retract.

122
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:39,690
He's going to shrivel up.

123
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,330
He's going to shrivel up now.

124
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:42,770
You hurt his feelings.

125
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,010
You're gonna hurt his feelings!

126
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:45,050
You're gonna hurt his feelings!

127
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,310
You're gonna hurt his feelings!

128
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:49,590
You're gonna hurt his feelings!

129
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:51,710
Good.

130
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:54,470
Mine is bigger than if it shrivels up.

131
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,710
Yours isn't real!

132
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,290
It's not biologic.

133
00:07:58,810 --> 00:07:59,290
Biological.

134
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:03,770
Hey, if I glue it on, if I glue it on somehow, it's gonna be real.

135
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:04,710
It's not biological!

136
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,510
It's made of plastic!

137
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,050
It's not biological!

138
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:09,150
It's made of plastic!

139
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,510
Okay, for those of you guys who really wanna know...

140
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,270
It's made of plastic!

141
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:16,530
Okay, Gumiho, why don't you explain what photo you sent me?

142
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:17,750
I sent her Dikachu!

143
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,050
Can you say that again?

144
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,790
Can you elaborate?

145
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,390
I, V.

146
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,810
Gumiho, sent Doki Bird Dikachu.

147
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,130
Can you elaborate what that is?

148
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:36,050
It is a Pikachu with a huge strap on.

149
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:38,990
Okay.

150
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:46,290
Okay.

151
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,310
Okay.

152
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:58,210
By the way, guys, this is one of her favorite pictures that she has in her folder.

153
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,750
I have this photo for like, seven years!

154
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:03,650
And that helps my- That does not defend you!

155
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,750
That literally helps my case!

156
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,830
She has this photo!

157
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:11,810
I've seen this photo so many times!

158
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:12,430
I've seen this photo so many times!

159
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:13,530
Because she loves it!

160
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,510
She loves this photo so much!

161
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:19,090
We've been friends for more than eight years now!

162
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:24,150
And I have- I've seen Dikachu for a while now!

163
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:25,570
And I have- I've seen Dikachu for a while now!

164
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:26,550
It is so good!

165
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,470
It's such a good photo!

166
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,770
It's so good!

167
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:31,630
Alright.

168
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:36,950
Okay, apparently my sound guy was like, you gotta turn Gumi down a little bit.

169
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,430
Sound guy?

170
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:40,630
Sound guy?

171
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:41,810
Okay.

172
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:43,290
Okay.

173
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,130
How about- How about now?

174
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,610
Alright, anyway guys.

175
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:53,650
This is gonna be like, the true friendship test between Gumi and I.

176
00:09:53,810 --> 00:10:04,230
Because we've been friends for more than eight- Gumi, you know you're not gonna be- You're gonna be screaming in like- If I turn you up right now because you talk like that, you're gonna be screaming in the next like, ten minutes.

177
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,550
Yeah...

178
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:11,570
Alright, so...

179
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:14,230
By the way, later on apparently- That's me!

180
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,010
I was not ready you son of a bitch!

181
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,590
That's me- It's a cutscene!

182
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:19,950
You don't have to be ready!

183
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:21,550
I love cutscenes!

184
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,270
No you don't!

185
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:24,750
Okay, I don't.

186
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:30,130
I was like, don't search Dikachu in Google.

187
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:34,610
Yes, if there's a dick in front of Dikachu, don't search it.

188
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,490
I know, I've gotta work overtime.

189
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:38,750
Well you're British?

190
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:39,850
That is you.

191
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:40,710
That is so you.

192
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:41,570
You're British too!

193
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:42,870
That is so you.

194
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:43,410
No I'm not!

195
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,930
I can't do any accents!

196
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,090
Oh fuck, you're right!

197
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,610
Oh fuck, you're right!

198
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Oh my god, our child is- Is she okay?

199
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:57,480
What?

200
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,700
What is she doing?

201
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,960
Why is she watching us?

202
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:05,770
Dude, that was me!

203
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:06,950
That was me in fourth grade!

204
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,550
Did I tell you the story?

205
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:09,690
In fourth grade?

206
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:12,090
Mhm, when I was a kid.

207
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:12,650
Yeah?

208
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:21,730
I got a bad report card, so my family told me I wasn't allowed to be in a room with any working electronics so I was locked in a dark room basically.

209
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,250
And I played with clay.

210
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:23,550
Well not even lights?

211
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:33,030
Well the lights were allowed to be on, but like I played, like- Get out, get out, that- Wait, I can't Oh, get out.

212
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,190
Wait, you husband.

213
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:42,570
Anyways, I played with clay the entire summer and I think that's what like broke me mentally.

214
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,310
Wait, that was your breaking point?

215
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:50,030
Yeah, no, I used to be like the stereotypical like quiet girl in school.

216
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:50,730
Yeah.

217
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,630
But then um- There's no way you were like that.

218
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,170
Playing with clay and talking to clay all summer.

219
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:57,370
Did they have a name?

220
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,590
Does he- Does he have a name?

221
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,950
No, I made like different clay monsters.

222
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:03,430
I made them evolve into Pokemon.

223
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,390
They were my OCs, if you will.

224
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,230
Uh, Rose.

225
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,130
We know your original characters do not steal.

226
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,130
You know we love you.

227
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:15,390
Your mom doesn't love you, apparently.

228
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,330
That means that- Okay.

229
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:22,290
Um, your dad actually doesn't want you.

230
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,610
Neither of us wants you.

231
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:29,090
Uh, we're trying to say we're sending you away to Harry Styles.

232
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:30,770
Harry Styles?

233
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:32,850
Where the fuck is Harry Styles?

234
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,010
We're sending you to Harry Styles.

235
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:41,110
Yeah, but where is Harry Styles as a location?

236
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:49,130
Oh shit, you know Harry Styles?

237
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:57,970
Wait, what the fuck is that bird thing on her poster?

238
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:00,070
Who- Bro, she's so spoiled!

239
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,670
What bird thing?

240
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,190
Like that post- The dragon?

241
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,130
Yeah, no.

242
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,350
Bro, this girl is so spoiled.

243
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:10,070
This girl has a room that's like twice as big as my room.

244
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:11,170
Oh fuck!

245
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,190
She lives in a fucking barn?

246
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,110
I would- woah!

247
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,710
No, it's just- that's not a barn.

248
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:24,250
It's like when suburban areas have those- oh no, this is a farm.

249
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:29,230
It's a different body, this is a farm.

250
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,050
I saw the milk cat.

251
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:33,450
I was gonna say.

252
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,730
What the fuck, Dr. Hakeem?

253
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:42,470
But where did she get her British- oh, her mom.

254
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:46,070
Okay, I was gonna say, where did the girl- little girl get this British accent?

255
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:49,510
That shows I take better care of her because she took after my accent.

256
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:54,490
Yeah, because someone has to work and make money for this family!

257
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,410
I'm a doctor!

258
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,950
I'm literally a doctor!

259
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,430
You don't know- we don't know that.

260
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:01,290
For real.

261
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:07,830
You could be pretending- you could just- Say you're a doctor, and then like, just go out to the bar or some shit.

262
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,690
That seems like a goomy thing to do.

263
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:13,110
Honey, I have to go to work now.

264
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,330
It's 9pm.

265
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,610
Yeah, it was an emergency call.

266
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,230
Yeah, the horses need help.

267
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,470
I'm a horse doctor, by the way.

268
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,210
You said you were a chicken doctor yesterday!

269
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:30,710
Girl, I- call me Mr. Worldwide.

270
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,830
I'd be all over the world and fixin' everything.

271
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:46,970
Cody!

272
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,530
I'm trying to sleep!

273
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:49,630
Shut up!

274
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:51,970
That's us.

275
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,670
Does that mean we can't die now that we're dolls?

276
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,110
Maybe.

277
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:01,410
Yo, the little girl's pretty impressive.

278
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:06,810
How the fuck did she make a doll with like, puppet- With like, crochet and wood?

279
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,750
Did she like, carve that herself?

280
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,250
This looks handmade.

281
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:11,470
Yeah.

282
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,690
Oh, she's pretty talented.

283
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,050
That's our child.

284
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:15,950
Dude, our place is a mess.

285
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:17,930
No wonder I'm divorcing you.

286
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:19,470
Oh, yeah, yeah.

287
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:22,790
It was my fault that the barn's not clean enough.

288
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:26,650
You literally say you work in the farm and at the barn.

289
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:27,910
No, no, no, no, no.

290
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:28,930
I say I work.

291
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,750
I didn't say I clean the barn.

292
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:32,690
What the fuck?

293
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:35,750
Can't keep your workplace clean.

294
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:37,670
Dude, this guy makes me uncomfortable.

295
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,530
The book of love.

296
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,610
Dude, he has a butt chin.

297
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,510
Oh my god, he does.

298
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:48,390
Oh, is that his lip?

299
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,850
Oh my god, you did jump.

300
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,810
Killing myself in game.

301
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,710
Oh shit, we can't die!

302
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,690
We can't die!

303
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,050
Oh my god.

304
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,250
He's creepy.

305
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,050
I would never want to talk to this guy.

306
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:13,610
Hey!

307
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:17,630
This could be our third husband.

308
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:20,650
Third?

309
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:24,090
This everyone is omen from Melon, obviously.

310
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,290
Wait a minute.

311
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:28,750
Third?

312
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:34,170
Plus, I promised your daughter to fix your marriage.

313
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,450
How the fuck do you promise our daughter anything?

314
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:37,710
Why would you try?

315
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:38,510
You've been talking to her all day.

316
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,330
Hey, it's Rose!

317
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:40,810
Wait.

318
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:44,290
Dude, he had a creepy ass old man flip-top on her.

319
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,190
Wait a minute.

320
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,610
Excuse me, sir.

321
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:53,670
But why are you talking to our daughter?

322
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:54,310
What?

323
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,930
This is me.

324
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:58,630
I'm left.

325
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,810
Okay, X is... we're using controller, right?

326
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,870
Well, let's find a way.

327
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:06,730
Alright, we gotta leave.

328
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,490
Okay, when you said you're left, I'm left.

329
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:09,670
So I guess it's just like...

330
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:09,790
I'm left.

331
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,130
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

332
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:11,830
I think so, yeah.

333
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:13,770
Alright, we gotta turn on this lever.

334
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:15,750
Oh my god, it's like McGee.

335
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,090
Be a deer.

336
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,130
Be a deer and help me turn on this lever.

337
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,590
I don't think that you're talking to me, man.

338
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:22,870
Hey, man!

339
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:24,270
What's going on here?

340
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:25,130
Goomy.

341
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:25,810
How do I punch?

342
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,910
Turn on this lever.

343
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:28,990
Whoa.

344
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:29,470
Ooh.

345
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,230
Whoa, Meg.

346
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:31,810
Ew.

347
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:33,330
Meg, uh, they're alive.

348
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,070
What is going on here?

349
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,530
I have no clue.

350
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:42,890
But whatever's going on, we can't lower that staircase without those fuses.

351
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,330
But... those fuses?

352
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:48,510
They just... they just ran away.

353
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,410
I mean, did you see them with their little fuse legs?

354
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:52,850
We'll worry about that later.

355
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,730
Let's just bring them back.

356
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,370
Wait, we have to bring them back?

357
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:57,950
Then what's the point of like...

358
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,930
Okay, do we work... oh wait.

359
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:00,310
Oh, no.

360
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,210
It's just two.

361
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:02,610
We already got two of them.

362
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,830
That's the easiest puzzles ever.

363
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:06,490
Yep.

364
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:07,390
Last one.

365
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:07,890
This is the third one.

366
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,310
Yeah, but do we have to do it together?

367
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,450
Yeah, we don't even have to do this together.

368
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,510
Only one of us has to do this.

369
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:16,190
Same here.

370
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,430
Okay, A... okay, A, B.

371
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,390
Where the fuck...

372
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,930
Oh, it teaches us the controls.

373
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,470
It's like Mega Man.

374
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,490
Tomorrow, we'll be Mega Man.

375
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:29,790
You know what?

376
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:30,790
I don't even need to do this.

377
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:31,590
You can do this yourself.

378
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:33,390
I'll just wait here.

379
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:34,610
Okay.

380
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:37,970
I don't like the sound of that.

381
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,750
Girl, I literally need... look at this shit.

382
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,050
Oh shit, okay.

383
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,630
I didn't know at first.

384
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,150
I was like... it was like one guy.

385
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,170
Come on, you're strong enough for that.

386
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,030
You don't need me.

387
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,510
Come on, what happened to all the horses?

388
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,530
Girl, I'm not carrying them.

389
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:01,250
What happened to all the horses?

390
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:01,750
I'm just fixing them.

391
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,590
Yeah, but don't you have to like, you know, like...

392
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,310
What the fuck is that sound?

393
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:05,930
Do you hear that?

394
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,590
What is that?

395
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,350
I think it was the door.

396
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:09,730
No, there was something.

397
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,130
There was a little grumble sound.

398
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:12,670
Is it one of your horses?

399
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,810
This is why they're divorced?

400
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,810
Look, that's why we're trying to get divorced right now.

401
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:18,910
What the fuck?

402
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:21,910
Wait, toggle sprint.

403
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:22,970
Oh, okay.

404
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,150
We just gotta press that.

405
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:25,050
Oh.

406
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,710
Wait, how do we get there?

407
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,810
Oh, there's a wood... there's a wood over here.

408
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:33,650
There's a wood over here.

409
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,550
There's a wood over there.

410
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:36,650
Alright.

411
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,230
Let's do this together.

412
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:38,750
Look at that.

413
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:39,050
See?

414
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,550
Look at this teamwork.

415
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,870
And then we jump...

416
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,270
Wait.

417
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,350
Oh shit, I'm dead.

418
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,250
Wait, what?

419
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,150
Oh, okay.

420
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:50,410
This is why you're the doctor.

421
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:51,990
And I'm the farm boy.

422
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:54,190
Yeah.

423
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:02,050
This is... this is why you do all the thinking for us here.

424
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,070
Yeah.

425
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:04,870
I'm like...

426
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,270
Sorry.

427
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,890
I'm like the... Oh, what the fuck?

428
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:09,250
X?

429
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,030
Yeah, that's what I said.

430
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,190
I'm like the... I'm like the... the arm here.

431
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:19,390
I'm the muscle.

432
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:20,150
You're like the arm here?

433
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:20,950
I'm the muscle.

434
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,390
Wait, how did you get there?

435
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:23,890
Wait, how do I...

436
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:24,550
This way.

437
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:25,830
I'm the muscle.

438
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:27,250
Whoa.

439
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:29,350
I think this powers up the soul.

440
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:30,850
What do you do?

441
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,010
Let's check it out.

442
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:32,850
What?

443
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:33,690
Oh, okay.

444
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,250
I did it.

445
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,090
You're welcome, sweetie.

446
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:39,890
Ew.

447
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:43,750
Hey, I think we have to do something about this.

448
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:44,090
What do you mean ew?

449
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:45,050
We're married.

450
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,090
What do you mean?

451
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,370
Not for long.

452
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:54,650
I mean, our daughter's trying to fix our relationship right now.

453
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,830
What, you don't want your daughter to fix her relationship?

454
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,370
I'll throw this shit off the cliff.

455
00:20:59,510 --> 00:20:59,850
Do it.

456
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:00,670
Do it, pussy.

457
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:01,290
You won't.

458
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:02,170
Do it.

459
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,790
Yeah, that's fucking right.

460
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:13,050
What the fuck is that?

461
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:13,730
Do you see that shit?

462
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:14,690
What?

463
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:14,970
What?

464
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:15,250
What?

465
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:15,910
See what?

466
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:16,910
It's looking at us.

467
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:17,470
What is?

468
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:18,270
On top of the bucket.

469
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:18,490
Look.

470
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:19,390
Where is she?

471
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:19,710
Where?

472
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:20,370
On the bucket.

473
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:20,770
Look.

474
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:21,090
Where?

475
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,050
I think you're going crazy.

476
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,750
Just ignore the glowing eye.

477
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:25,870
I think... yeah.

478
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:30,250
Yeah, just ignore the glowing eye.

479
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:30,870
Bye-bye.

480
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:31,330
Bye-bye.

481
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,030
Oh, my head's too big?

482
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:36,930
Give me a sec.

483
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:37,250
Sorry.

484
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:38,870
It's where I startle all my brain.

485
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:46,040
Give me a sec.

486
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,700
Apparently, my head is too big.

487
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,300
That was a cool joke, man.

488
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:53,960
Okay.

489
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,200
What do you mean joke?

490
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,740
What do you mean joke, huh?

491
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:00,700
Okay.

492
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,000
There's a reason why I'm the doctor.

493
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:02,860
Oh, perfect.

494
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:03,320
Yeah.

495
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,740
Are you trying to say people who work in the barn are stupid?

496
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,780
Is that what you're trying to say?

497
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:07,940
No.

498
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,620
I'm just saying I'm smarter than you and my brain's bigger.

499
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,060
I don't know.

500
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,100
Look at the head size.

501
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,900
Well, what kind of brain can be stored in that tiny head of yours?

502
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:20,180
Girl, sometimes I'll be hearing you shake your head and it sounds like a baby rattle.

503
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,080
There she is.

504
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:21,480
No.

505
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:23,760
Rose, darling.

506
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,540
Rose, darling.

507
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,380
Rose, darling.

508
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,520
Rose, darling.

509
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:27,960
Rose, darling.

510
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,720
Rose, darling.

511
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,640
Dude, get this guy away from our kid.

512
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,720
Yeah, get out of the way.

513
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,860
I need to go and talk to my daughter.

514
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,040
Your daughter?

515
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,800
Oh, you talk like you own her.

516
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,420
Oh, whoa.

517
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,360
Whoa.

518
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:43,060
We don't own people anymore.

519
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:44,800
Whoa.

520
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,100
It's 2024.

521
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,200
Hey, explain Pal World.

522
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,280
Explain Pal World.

523
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,400
They're not people.

524
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,200
Oh, except for those people.

525
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:52,720
You can catch humans.

526
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,120
Yeah.

527
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,800
Why do I recognize your voice?

528
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,140
What the fuck?

529
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:58,720
What?

530
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,140
No.

531
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,980
We've never met.

532
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,100
Sorry.

533
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,700
Looks a bit like a vacuum cleaner.

534
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:04,720
Oh, yeah.

535
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,440
Because it is your vacuum cleaner.

536
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,540
Is that a vacuum cleaner?

537
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,480
My vacuum?

538
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,440
It's not my job.

539
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,640
Dude, imagine putting something in a vacuum.

540
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,380
You know, the guy who suck up all kinds of crap in your stomach.

541
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,640
Oh, no.

542
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,540
That's...

543
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,640
That's you.

544
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,360
You've ruined my bowels with all that crap.

545
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,920
That's your purpose, though.

546
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:27,840
What are you sucking up dust?

547
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:28,620
That was it?

548
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:28,980
Yeah.

549
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,380
Whoa!

550
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:33,920
No!

551
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:35,620
God!

552
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,660
Look, there it is!

553
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,580
Is that dirt?

554
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,400
You call that dust?

555
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,040
Well, I mean, you know, some of it...

556
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,600
That's why it broke down.

557
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,220
It was your fault.

558
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,700
It's a vacuum cleaner!

559
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:50,620
No!

560
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,140
Fix me!

561
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,200
Thank you.

562
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,400
Instead, you put me away from life in here!

563
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,320
Yup.

564
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,480
Look at what you fucking did!

565
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,780
We got consumed.

566
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,660
Oh god, I hate throw up.

567
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,080
That's a lie.

568
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,140
You have two emotes dedicated to it.

569
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,660
I should have never made that bet with you.

570
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,060
We got bored.

571
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,340
Eww!

572
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:33,560
Oh god, please just take us to the math part.

573
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,760
That is our strong point!

574
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,840
We're collabing right now!

575
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,260
I don't like that he's humping the air.

576
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,520
You saw that?

577
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,780
Look at him!

578
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,140
Wait, did he flex his hips at us?

579
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,500
Yeah, he did.

580
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,500
I think we're getting closer because of our hate of this guy.

581
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,740
Yeah, I think he is fixing our marriage.

582
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,420
Yeah, look!

583
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,520
It is fixable!

584
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:22,380
What if we both just go separate ways?

585
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,780
Do we really have to?

586
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:24,260
Yeah!

587
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,520
We just walk away from each other.

588
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:30,900
We just walk away from each other.

589
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,460
What if we just decide to stay dolls forever?

590
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,440
Yeah, yeah.

591
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,160
What if we just decide that?

592
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:36,860
What the fuck?

593
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,800
What the fuck is that music?

594
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,660
That's bad.

595
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,360
Bad water.

596
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,320
Hey, have you ever thought about jumping?

597
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,480
There's a fucking eyeball!

598
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,740
Have you ever thought about jumping?

599
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,980
Alright, I'll race you to the finish line!

600
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:56,440
Sorry, I said press G.

601
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,140
I'm up.

602
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,020
I'm already gone!

603
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:02,880
What the fuck?

604
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,060
What the fuck?

605
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:05,720
How do we do this?

606
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,620
It's not this way.

607
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,200
It's not that way.

608
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:08,900
It's the other way.

609
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,860
Oh, wait, you have to move it!

610
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,660
You have to move it!

611
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:12,900
Okay.

612
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,640
Get inside!

613
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,420
You bitch!

614
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,820
You fucking bitch!

615
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:24,700
This is exactly why we're getting a divorce!

616
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,900
This is exactly why we're getting a divorce!

617
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,280
I hope we stay dolls forever!

618
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:39,680
I hope we stay dolls forever and get eaten by a fucking cat!

619
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,260
What the fuck!

620
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:45,960
That's taking right!

621
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:46,820
I said it!

622
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,500
I fucking said it!

623
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,900
What are you gonna do about it?

624
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,600
Oh shit, you're a dog!

625
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,460
I hope... what the fuck?

626
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,680
I hope you get shit off by a bird.

627
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,360
Whoa!

628
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,220
Hey, I'll wait for you.

629
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,680
Wait, why does it have a thingy over there too?

630
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,920
Oh nice, okay I have to...

631
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,220
do this.

632
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,080
What does that do?

633
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:18,840
I don't know.

634
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:19,700
Alright!

635
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,260
The current has reversed!

636
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,280
Oh, it reversed!

637
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,840
So you have to...

638
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,640
So you have to do the thing on the other side.

639
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,180
Okay, no.

640
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,720
Like, on the other side, you pick it up.

641
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,880
And then... yeah, yeah, yeah.

642
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,020
And then you put it up.

643
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:34,480
Yeah, that's right.

644
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,320
Yeah, see?

645
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,040
You're gonna let me tell you what to do.

646
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:42,900
Man moment.

647
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:43,760
Man moment.

648
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,040
See, I don't miss the hole.

649
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,240
Cause I'm not a man.

650
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,660
It was one time!

651
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

652
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,700
It was one time!

653
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,000
That was kinda fun actually.

654
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,000
Oh shit, what the fuck is this?

655
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,520
Get in.

656
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,220
You bitch!

657
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,180
My hand slipped!

658
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,020
My hand slipped!

659
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:18,380
You fucker!

660
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,760
Oh, oh, oh!

661
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,420
Woah!

662
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:21,900
Woah!

663
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,740
I'm gonna punch you!

664
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,580
Alright, you're good.

665
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,900
Don't worry, I'll help you.

666
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,560
Woah, woah, woah!

667
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,420
Woah, woah, woah!

668
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,260
No!

669
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,000
What the fuck is this?

670
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,020
Do it.

671
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,120
Just press the button!

672
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:46,880
There you go.

673
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:47,380
See?

674
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,660
Look at that.

675
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,560
I sac- Go to the next one, you bitch!

676
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:52,640
Oh, whoops.

677
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,380
Sorry.

678
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,260
Sorry.

679
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,720
Husband moment.

680
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,620
Husband moment.

681
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,580
Husband moment.

682
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,500
Go to the next one!

683
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,380
I'm trying!

684
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,160
I am!

685
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,920
I did the thing!

686
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,420
Alright.

687
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,480
Look at me go.

688
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,680
This is why I'm first.

689
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,240
How long is this freaking vacuum?

690
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,380
I don't know.

691
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,200
It's pretty long.

692
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:22,880
Woah!

693
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,900
Wait, am I gonna make it?

694
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:26,540
I think I made it.

695
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,160
I made it.

696
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,040
See, look, I didn't miss the hole.

697
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,540
I didn't miss the hole this time.

698
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,860
Yeah, everyone gets lucky once in a while.

699
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,620
This is why we only have one kid.

700
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:47,750
This is why we only have one kid.

701
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:48,210
Thank god.

702
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:49,190
It happens.

703
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:52,290
Thank god we only traumatized one child.

704
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:54,830
It's alright.

705
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:57,190
Only one kid will have to pay for therapy.

706
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:00,150
I'm not paying for it.

707
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:01,470
I'm not paying for it.

708
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:02,750
She's gonna pay for it herself.

709
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:04,830
What the fuck?

710
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:05,750
What the fuck?

711
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:06,530
Okay, I'm dead.

712
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:08,690
What happened to you?

713
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:09,990
I don't know.

714
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:14,150
Someone was trying to jump and I thought she was doing the right thing.

715
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:17,790
Oh!

716
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:19,070
Oh, wow.

717
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,950
You couldn't even make that jump.

718
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:22,190
I made it, man.

719
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:26,190
You know you gotta grip onto the side to make it.

720
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,230
That's not making a jump.

721
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:30,870
If you barely made it, it's not making a jump.

722
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:32,170
What the fuck?

723
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:33,410
Why did you fucking...

724
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:38,250
Okay, no, no, no.

725
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:38,690
I fucked up.

726
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:39,670
I fucked up.

727
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:41,930
I didn't realize...

728
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:44,230
I can't grip on this.

729
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,690
Alright, now pull.

730
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:48,510
Yes, okay, now keep...

731
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,250
Now keep spinning it.

732
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,050
There you go.

733
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:53,710
Good.

734
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:55,170
Does that mean I can leave you now?

735
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:57,210
What the fuck?

736
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:00,010
Well, I'm not the one with the third husband.

737
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:04,870
Hey, no need to be jealous of Omen, man.

738
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:10,410
Oh, I accidentally jumped off it.

739
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:12,690
You know what they say about marriage?

740
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:14,150
Death do us part.

741
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:16,530
What?

742
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,930
You don't know it.

743
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:19,850
What does that mean?

744
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:21,390
No, no, no.

745
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:25,250
You fucking whore!

746
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:32,910
You know,

747
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:39,670
I think you know why we're getting a divorce now.

748
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:45,930
How the fuck do you do this?

749
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,450
Get in there!

750
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:49,730
You get in there!

751
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:51,450
No!

752
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:52,130
Why me?

753
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:58,650
You fucking bitch!

754
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:09,490
I'm not even doing anything!

755
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:11,050
That's just you!

756
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:11,350
Swap it!

757
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:12,350
Swap it!

758
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:14,570
Swap it!

759
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:15,610
I swapped!

760
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,530
I swapped!

761
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:17,630
I swapped!

762
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:18,130
I swapped!

763
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:24,010
There you go!

764
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,150
God!

765
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,470
I have to go non-verbal.

766
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:29,990
You have to go non-verbal?

767
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:34,670
Oh no, we have to do this too?

768
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:35,770
Okay.

769
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:38,010
Goomy, remember all the good times we've had?

770
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:43,190
Goomy, remember all the good- You missed that jump!

771
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,570
How do we tie him up?

772
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:50,070
It's so cute.

773
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:53,650
It's cause I don't trust you that I'm double jumping.

774
00:32:58,090 --> 00:32:59,150
What do we do here?

775
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:01,210
Oh, what the... get on the Roombas.

776
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,030
There we go.

777
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:07,270
Okay, let's go.

778
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:08,510
We're such good friends.

779
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:11,090
Friends?

780
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:14,990
We have to stay friends after divorce!

781
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:16,490
For a child!

782
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:19,410
I only do that to exes I like.

783
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:20,050
I only do that to exes I like.

784
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:22,170
Alright.

785
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:23,010
Wait.

786
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:25,050
Where's the other end of this though?

787
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:30,090
Wait, but where do we- do I just like go here?

788
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:31,210
No.

789
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:33,010
It doesn't make sense.

790
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:37,210
Where does the end of that vacuum go?

791
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:37,970
Where does the end of that vacuum go?

792
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:37,990
Oh!

793
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:39,830
I get sucked in here!

794
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:41,470
Goomy, you could have said something!

795
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:43,630
Hey, listen.

796
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:45,070
Everyday's a school day.

797
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:46,090
You learn more and more everyday.

798
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:48,250
You could have said something.

799
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:49,030
You could have said something.

800
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:52,870
Alright, here you go.

801
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:53,330
What's this?

802
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,050
I turned off the light.

803
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:56,090
I don't know what it does.

804
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:00,810
Why didn't you turn it back on?

805
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:04,070
What, you don't trust my judge?

806
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:05,930
We're trying to save electricity here.

807
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:07,430
Girl.

808
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:09,950
I'm trying to take every cent of your money.

809
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:10,810
Woah!

810
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:12,830
Uh huh.

811
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:15,590
I thought we signed a prenup!

812
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:16,370
No.

813
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:19,070
Wait, you didn't sign the prenup?

814
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:22,710
I wrote down Kaz's name instead.

815
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:24,010
That's fucked up.

816
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,570
That is fucked up.

817
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:27,110
That is actually illegal.

818
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:29,550
Wait.

819
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:33,590
Did you just admit that you committed fraud on my stream?

820
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:35,350
No, hey.

821
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:35,830
No.

822
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:42,090
Hey, I think one of us had to press the- You know what to do.

823
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,870
You know what to do.

824
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,650
Goomy, you know what to do.

825
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:49,590
Come on.

826
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:50,730
You don't trust me?

827
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:51,790
Okay, that's on you.

828
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:55,210
I didn't trust you.

829
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:56,850
Go, go.

830
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:57,630
Okay, I'm going.

831
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:58,490
There, see?

832
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:00,590
Oh, you don't trust me.

833
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:01,030
Wow.

834
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:02,930
Wow.

835
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:06,990
How do I do this?

836
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:09,990
I'm sending over a platform, man.

837
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:11,850
How is that a platform?

838
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:14,310
It's this!

839
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:15,670
This was a platform!

840
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:17,250
Oh, okay.

841
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:18,010
I see it now.

842
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:19,530
I'm a little special.

843
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,030
You like that.

844
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,690
Fucking whore.

845
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:28,350
Hey.

846
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:29,690
You bitch.

847
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:33,330
Oh, get on that.

848
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:34,710
No, you get on it.

849
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,850
You get on it.

850
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:41,130
You're pissing me off.

851
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:42,190
You're pissing me off.

852
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:46,990
Goomy, grab the pipe!

853
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:47,730
Grab the pipe!

854
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,180
I'll do it this time.

855
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,300
Sorry, I didn't know where to go.

856
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,700
Oh, I'm sorry.

857
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,520
I didn't know where to go.

858
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,820
You didn't tell me where to go.

859
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,620
I need someone to tell me what to do.

860
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,700
You didn't aim it high enough!

861
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,800
Maybe you should do this.

862
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:18,980
Yay.

863
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:19,100
Yay.

864
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,640
But clearly I'm not good at aiming.

865
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,420
You should know in the bathroom.

866
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,240
I should have known.

867
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:29,020
You should have known in the bathroom.

868
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:34,830
What are you doing?

869
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:35,750
Oh, you go up!

870
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:39,830
Yeah, I'm kind of smart or something.

871
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:41,730
What do we do from here?

872
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:43,570
Oh, oh, I go inside!

873
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:49,830
We need to get it down!

874
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:50,710
We need to get it down!

875
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:51,570
Wait, where are you?

876
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:52,570
Where did you go?

877
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:56,530
Where are you?

878
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:57,430
Oh, aim that thingy!

879
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:00,890
Like this?

880
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:03,650
Yeah, aim at the hole!

881
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:05,370
I'm doing it, I'm doing it.

882
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:06,790
Well, you have to aim too.

883
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:10,250
What do you mean I have to aim?

884
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,230
I'm sending it to you!

885
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:12,030
I'm doing it!

886
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:12,670
I'm doing it!

887
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:15,510
I think I'm doing it!

888
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:18,170
Am I doing it?

889
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:19,930
I don't think I'm doing...

890
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:20,530
Oh, am I?

891
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:21,110
I'm doing it!

892
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:21,590
I'm doing it!

893
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:22,010
It's getting full!

894
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:25,450
I can aim!

895
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,330
Oh, I'm making it a little bit dirty.

896
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:28,810
You're gonna have to clean that up later.

897
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:31,070
What the fuck?

898
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:37,410
I'm the perfect husband.

899
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:39,430
Oh, then we push.

900
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:42,070
Oh, talk about dead weight!

901
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:43,150
Yeah.

902
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,050
That's you, right?

903
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:46,410
What?

904
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:47,850
I don't even have a death counter.

905
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:49,110
Uh oh.

906
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:50,130
Uh oh.

907
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:51,250
Is that first boss fight?

908
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,210
It's ugly!

909
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:55,670
You bought that vacuum!

910
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:59,590
I didn't think it had fucking googly eyes!

911
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:00,610
I didn't think it had fucking googly eyes!

912
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:02,670
No, I glued that on because I thought it looked cute.

913
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,990
No, I glued that on because I thought it looked cute.

914
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:09,970
Oh my gosh, she just liked me for real.

915
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:12,070
I can fix you!

916
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,910
That's why you married me!

917
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:15,870
Oh, I'm an engineer.

918
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:16,430
Oh!

919
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:18,970
You're an engineer doctor?

920
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:20,230
Yeah.

921
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:22,270
And you settled for me?

922
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,710
Yeah, worst mistake of my life.

923
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,600
Damn.

924
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,460
That's harsh, man.

925
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,380
You're replaceable.

926
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,120
That's why she's trying to replace me with a better husband.

927
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:49,920
What?

928
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:51,640
What?

929
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,780
I'm out of here!

930
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:53,540
See you later!

931
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,820
I'll show you who's the best, sucker!

932
00:38:59,100 --> 00:38:59,620
I'll show you who's the best, sucker!

933
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,640
How the fuck do we defeat him?

934
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,200
I don't see your fire blood here!

935
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:10,300
I thought we had to throw it back or some shit!

936
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,360
I thought we had to throw it back or some shit!

937
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,960
I'm literally doing my job!

938
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:17,340
I'm out of here!

939
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,440
Girl, what is that aim?

940
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,420
What do you mean?

941
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:19,940
That's a hit!

942
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:20,540
That's a hit!

943
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,100
That's a fucking hit!

944
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:22,760
Ow.

945
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:24,640
Okay.

946
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,700
Look, if you can't do this, you can't platform.

947
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,460
Girl, did you get hit earlier?

948
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,040
No.

949
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:34,620
No?

950
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,240
Are you aimed then?

951
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,480
If you're so good!

952
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,480
I'm sucking it!

953
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,180
It's still it?

954
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:43,560
I'm going to!

955
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:43,920
Look!

956
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:44,140
See?

957
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:44,540
Look!

958
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,120
I hit him!

959
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,340
This is the fucking easiest platform game ever.

960
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:50,700
What the fuck?

961
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:51,080
What the fuck?

962
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,260
Just run!

963
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,040
Just run!

964
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,800
You can't fucking throw forever!

965
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:56,380
See?

966
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,400
Oh shit.

967
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,100
I think you can go forever.

968
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,360
No, no.

969
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:03,760
It's fine.

970
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:04,280
It's fine.

971
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:04,940
No, you can't.

972
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:05,220
See?

973
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:05,500
Look.

974
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:06,920
You got tired.

975
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,260
Alright, I'll be at the bottom.

976
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:08,800
Okay?

977
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,320
I'll let you do the work at the top.

978
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:11,300
Ow.

979
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,280
I got hit.

980
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:15,800
Um, I fucked up.

981
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,640
Look, I'm sucking!

982
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,340
There you go!

983
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:21,640
There you go!

984
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,140
It's coming in!

985
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:22,740
It's coming in!

986
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:24,920
Look at that.

987
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,680
So easy.

988
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,360
Bro, we can't...

989
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:35,480
How are we supposed to get a speedrun if they're fucking making us do all this other shit?

990
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,920
I'm pretty sure there's got to be an exploit or something, right?

991
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:41,600
There has to be.

992
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,220
This is the slowest boss battle ever.

993
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:43,340
I'm pretty sure there's got to be an exploit or something, right?

994
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:46,720
I'm pretty sure there's got to be an exploit or something, right?

995
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:48,820
What are you mean?

996
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,180
It spawned next to me!

997
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:53,340
It spawned next to me!

998
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,360
Okay, I can't suck anymore.

999
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,400
Okay, I can't suck anymore.

1000
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,280
I can't suck anymore.

1001
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,420
It's my limit.

1002
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:01,740
Oh, shit.

1003
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:02,120
Oh, shit.

1004
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,060
I'm okay.

1005
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,380
I'm okay.

1006
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:07,660
Oh, I don't know.

1007
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,480
Why didn't you care about me getting hurt?

1008
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,700
Oh, I don't know.

1009
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,180
Why didn't you care about me getting hurt?

1010
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,580
And the fucker you're inting my run.

1011
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,660
Suck it!

1012
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,840
I'm sucking!

1013
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,360
Yeah.

1014
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,260
Yeah, I kinda did all that damage.

1015
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,500
I don't know what you're talking about.

1016
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:36,330
Hey, I'm back.

1017
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:37,870
Oh, hey, look.

1018
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:40,210
Your husband was gone, but you didn't care.

1019
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:40,870
Did you die?

1020
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:41,430
Oh, wow!

1021
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:43,170
Wow!

1022
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:45,390
You didn't even think about it.

1023
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:45,970
Did you even notice?

1024
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:48,290
Wow!

1025
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:52,230
She's already moved on so fast!

1026
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:53,650
I was focused on living, man.

1027
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:56,610
Time to finish this.

1028
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:57,930
How do we finish this?

1029
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:00,870
Oh, no!

1030
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:02,110
Eyeballs!

1031
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:05,870
Oh, that is so fucked up!

1032
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:07,490
Do you think this is too much?

1033
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:08,390
Kind of.

1034
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:10,110
But he tried to kill us.

1035
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:11,310
Oh, my God!

1036
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:12,170
Bro!

1037
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:14,550
What is wrong with you?

1038
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:18,970
What is wrong with you?

1039
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:19,630
What is wrong with you?

1040
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:19,690
Oh!

1041
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:22,930
He's gonna eat his eye!

1042
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,880
That's fucked up.

1043
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,520
That's fucked up.

1044
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,060
Oh, my God!

1045
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,600
Imagine dying like that.

1046
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,060
Bro, this was your idea.

1047
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:44,440
No.

1048
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,420
We both did it.

1049
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,100
I was peer pressured.

1050
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:50,440
Watch it.

1051
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,860
Why did she make them look like us?

1052
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,240
Because you're never home.

1053
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:57,160
Why didn't you tell me about them?

1054
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,820
I'm never home?

1055
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,960
I'm the one that knew about it!

1056
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:02,800
I'm the one that knew about it!

1057
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,380
Well, come on.

1058
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,060
Let's find her.

1059
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:04,840
Well, come on.

1060
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:04,940
Let's find her.

1061
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,360
Where are we?

1062
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:08,420
That's fucked up.

1063
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,140
Yeah, you were never home.

1064
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,140
Use this place.

1065
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,400
Get away from me.

1066
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:15,840
I'm getting closer.

1067
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:16,460
I'm getting closer.

1068
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:16,900
I'm getting closer.

1069
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,000
I'm getting closer.

1070
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:21,460
Ow.

1071
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,440
Hey, your husband drowned.

1072
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,060
Yeah, not a new.

1073
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:28,340
Whoa!

1074
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,260
Yeah, you need my help.

1075
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,040
You can't...

1076
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,260
I have to be here.

1077
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:36,520
Unfortunately.

1078
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,820
Dude, why the fuck is she still in here playing on her own?

1079
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:42,300
Rose!

1080
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:42,300
Rose!

1081
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:42,300
Rose!

1082
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:45,240
Rose, you have no other toys.

1083
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:46,580
You can look at her.

1084
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,500
That's crazy.

1085
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,500
This is her only toy.

1086
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,520
What the fuck is that?

1087
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:58,880
Who said that?

1088
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,860
What the hell is that?

1089
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:06,960
Ew!

1090
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:07,580
Is that a hammer?

1091
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:08,680
Yeah, it is!

1092
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:09,600
What is that?

1093
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:10,380
That's my tool, friends.

1094
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:15,500
We used to be important and taken care of, but that human locked us up in her toolbox and left.

1095
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,380
Yeah, that human.

1096
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:19,100
Her daughter?

1097
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,200
No, you!

1098
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:29,360
I heard that heartless woman found a new job in town and doesn't have time for her hobbies anymore.

1099
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,240
Who cares about hobbies?

1100
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:33,980
You know how painful it is to die from rust?

1101
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:35,840
Yeah, you heartless woman!

1102
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,320
Slowly!

1103
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:38,220
Slowly!

1104
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:38,620
Slowly!

1105
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:39,180
What the fuck?

1106
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:40,640
I don't like his eyes.

1107
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:42,540
You just don't like eyes in general.

1108
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:47,660
Ew.

1109
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:50,380
Oh.

1110
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,880
I don't even think I want to touch him.

1111
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:55,640
I wonder if he can poke his eyes out.

1112
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:59,000
Okay, what is going on there?

1113
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,760
How is he on my back?

1114
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:04,740
Woah!

1115
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:05,080
Oh!

1116
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:07,280
You're like that guy from Guardians of the Galaxy.

1117
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:07,760
Yeah!

1118
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,220
I have the whistle power.

1119
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:10,500
Yeah.

1120
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:15,560
Oh, nice.

1121
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:17,880
I bet you can't whistle.

1122
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,260
That's me.

1123
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:23,040
I did that.

1124
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:30,900
That was me.

1125
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,160
Do you like my whistle?

1126
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:34,940
Stop!

1127
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,580
What are you doing?

1128
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,540
Why are you having me?

1129
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,480
I can't do anything.

1130
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:47,660
Stop!

1131
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:52,760
Go ahead, then.

1132
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:53,380
Get away.

1133
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:54,940
Get away.

1134
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,800
Of course, I'm the one that aims.

1135
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,020
What are we supposed to do?

1136
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:02,060
Oh, like this?

1137
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,280
Okay.

1138
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:15,900
Okay.

1139
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:16,260
Okay.

1140
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:16,860
Okay.

1141
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:17,640
Wait, what are you doing?

1142
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,880
I think you have to jump down.

1143
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:22,700
On the other side.

1144
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:23,160
No.

1145
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,120
On the other side.

1146
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:25,440
Go on the other side!

1147
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,020
You said jump down!

1148
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:29,280
Oh!

1149
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:30,460
Oh!

1150
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:33,840
Okay, okay, I figured it out, Gumi.

1151
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:34,720
Okay, so you do that.

1152
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:36,180
I'll keep doing that.

1153
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:37,260
Gumi, I figured it out.

1154
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:37,700
I figured it out.

1155
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:38,820
I know how to solve this puzzle.

1156
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:40,860
And that's how you do it.

1157
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:41,360
You're welcome!

1158
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,000
This is why I'm the brains.

1159
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:44,420
Thank you!

1160
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:45,300
Thank you!

1161
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,080
You're welcome!

1162
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,860
Your savior is here now.

1163
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:50,340
Ready now?

1164
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:53,000
What the fuck?

1165
00:46:58,880 --> 00:46:59,620
You're fine.

1166
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:02,860
But how do I get across?

1167
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,080
Can I just swing from this?

1168
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:08,880
Can you throw your nail here?

1169
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:10,160
Oh, okay.

1170
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:14,040
What the fuck?

1171
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:15,240
What the fuck?

1172
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:19,980
Okay.

1173
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:28,790
You suck at this game.

1174
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:30,130
What do you mean me?

1175
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:32,110
You suck at the game too!

1176
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:35,230
Why didn't you make them jump already?

1177
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:36,950
Why do you need so much prep time?

1178
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:39,530
Why do you need so much prep time, huh?

1179
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:40,770
It's called momentum!

1180
00:47:41,210 --> 00:47:43,150
If you were an engineer, you would know that!

1181
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:44,670
But I'm not.

1182
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:45,950
You're the one that's stuck.

1183
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:47,130
You said it with a farm boy!

1184
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:50,070
Throw the fucking nail!

1185
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:51,410
Where?

1186
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,090
Oh, there.

1187
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:53,010
Sorry, I'm blind.

1188
00:47:56,170 --> 00:47:58,550
Dude, do I have to wait for it to load a bit?

1189
00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:00,250
I don't know.

1190
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:04,310
I think I have to wait for the wheel to complete.

1191
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:06,610
The wheel?

1192
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:07,830
No.

1193
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:09,950
Yeah, it has a small wheel on it.

1194
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:10,470
Oh!

1195
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:11,470
Oh!

1196
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:14,910
Here, have a second nail.

1197
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:17,250
I got two nails!

1198
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:19,870
Okay.

1199
00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:22,250
Nice.

1200
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:26,570
Look, see we're working together like a good couple.

1201
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:28,050
Why is this?

1202
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:29,110
Why do we do this here?

1203
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:31,770
Oh, wait, maybe...

1204
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:33,690
Oh, wait, what?

1205
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:34,990
Oh, you have to hammer that.

1206
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:35,630
Throw it in the hole!

1207
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:36,790
No, you have to come back here.

1208
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:37,550
No, you have to come here.

1209
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:38,150
Okay.

1210
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:38,890
Throw it in the hole.

1211
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:43,850
Okay, so what I think is that I have to throw it into a hole after you do that.

1212
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:46,790
See, that's what you do.

1213
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:48,930
So when you hammer...

1214
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:53,550
Yeah, so when you hammer it, I throw it into the hole.

1215
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:56,110
You're lucky I was here to help you.

1216
00:48:57,270 --> 00:48:59,410
I think I'm lucky to have you here.

1217
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:01,030
Yeah, you're so lucky.

1218
00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:02,810
You son of a bitch!

1219
00:49:03,830 --> 00:49:05,390
You come down here!

1220
00:49:06,590 --> 00:49:08,870
How was I supposed to know you didn't come down here?

1221
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:09,750
I didn't make it!

1222
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:11,590
Look at the other screen!

1223
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:15,670
Why would I look at the other screen?

1224
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:16,890
This is your business!

1225
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:18,470
Like...

1226
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:24,190
Nice.

1227
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:26,350
Thank you.

1228
00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:32,930
Whoa!

1229
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:33,790
Oh my god!

1230
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:34,770
I hate him.

1231
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:36,650
There are no relationships without challenges.

1232
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:38,390
Challenges make you grow!

1233
00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:39,730
What is it with you?

1234
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:40,790
Can't you just leave us alone?

1235
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:41,690
Yeah, leave us alone!

1236
00:49:42,050 --> 00:49:43,750
We're trying to fix our marriage!

1237
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:46,010
And it's going really well.

1238
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:47,910
Right?

1239
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:51,030
So, when you hear this sound...

1240
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:53,470
Following it, keep following it, and you will find the challenge you seek!

1241
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:54,090
Oh, that's kind of cute.

1242
00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:57,790
And you will find the challenge you seek!

1243
00:49:58,090 --> 00:49:59,150
Do we have to do the challenge?

1244
00:49:59,390 --> 00:49:59,950
We're not completionists.

1245
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:01,990
Yeah!

1246
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:02,410
I don't know.

1247
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:04,970
Welcome to your first couple challenge!

1248
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:05,670
I think we have to.

1249
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:09,410
Win or lose, you must do it together!

1250
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:09,790
You must do it together!

1251
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:10,750
You must do it together!

1252
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:11,590
Huh?

1253
00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:14,050
Well, I guess we're gonna have to.

1254
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:16,050
All right, you wanna give it a try?

1255
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:17,590
We haven't got time for this.

1256
00:50:17,830 --> 00:50:19,050
Oh, you afraid of losing?

1257
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:20,190
Me?

1258
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:22,050
No way!

1259
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:23,690
Bring it on!

1260
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:24,830
Oh, I'm gonna bring it.

1261
00:50:26,510 --> 00:50:28,870
This isn't a competition, Gumi.

1262
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:34,670
Score it by staying up and...

1263
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:35,590
Wait.

1264
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:40,590
Go ahead and ready up!

1265
00:50:40,590 --> 00:50:40,770
I'm ready!

1266
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:41,650
No, wait a minute.

1267
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:43,730
Go ahead and ready up!

1268
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:44,890
Wait a minute!

1269
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:45,870
Go ahead!

1270
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:46,870
Ready up!

1271
00:50:47,770 --> 00:50:48,450
Oh, no.

1272
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:49,130
I don't know.

1273
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:50,750
I mean, we don't have to.

1274
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:51,370
What?

1275
00:50:51,370 --> 00:50:52,090
No, no, no.

1276
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:52,510
You know?

1277
00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:54,310
Hey, ready up.

1278
00:50:54,310 --> 00:50:54,750
I'm ready.

1279
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:56,910
Look, I'm shaking my hips on the screen.

1280
00:50:57,310 --> 00:51:00,750
No, come on.

1281
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:01,850
Gumi, we've been...

1282
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:02,270
Yeah, go ahead.

1283
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:05,150
We've been such good friends for...

1284
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:05,950
I'm winning.

1285
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:07,450
I'm winning.

1286
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:09,750
You need to warm up for this.

1287
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:10,090
I'm gonna go get some ice cream.

1288
00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:12,130
Where am I gonna go?

1289
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:37,860
Oh, no.

1290
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:38,700
Hey.

1291
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,580
You're pretty bad at this.

1292
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:44,540
You're not even gaining points either!

1293
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:47,020
You're pretty bad at this.

1294
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:47,640
I'm not gonna lie.

1295
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:52,800
Neither one of us is getting any points.

1296
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,580
Why are we not getting any points?

1297
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:56,120
Because you're not staying up.

1298
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,520
I don't have to.

1299
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:00,100
Ow.

1300
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:04,540
I think I went from fault.

1301
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,900
Like, how do I gain points?

1302
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,180
I don't understand.

1303
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,280
You gave me points.

1304
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:14,580
Did you not read the rules?

1305
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:15,520
Sorry.

1306
00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:19,850
Don't go.

1307
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:22,810
That's not fair!

1308
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:26,240
I can't stay up for life!

1309
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,760
Yeah, because I'm a god gamer.

1310
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,080
It's not fair!

1311
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:37,440
The game is actually rigged!

1312
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:41,240
Like, this game is actually rigged!

1313
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:43,780
This is not fair.

1314
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,360
This is like not fair.

1315
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:47,520
This game is so rigged.

1316
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:55,620
This is not fair.

1317
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,920
This is fucked up.

1318
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,440
This is so fucked up!

1319
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:04,840
Oh, you got a point!

1320
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:06,440
How?

1321
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:09,160
How did I get a point?

1322
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:15,020
There should be like a cooldown.

1323
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:16,560
What the fuck?

1324
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:18,560
How did I even get this point?

1325
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:19,240
I don't know.

1326
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:22,020
Oh my god.

1327
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:30,580
Give me another point!

1328
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:32,000
Give me another point!

1329
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:35,800
I hate this.

1330
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:36,360
I got one!

1331
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:37,860
I hate this.

1332
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:39,880
Oh, I got another!

1333
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:40,240
No!

1334
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:43,740
This is fucked up.

1335
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,660
This is like so geared up towards the hammer.

1336
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:48,200
There's no way.

1337
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:51,140
There's no fucking way.

1338
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,840
There's nothing better!

1339
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,100
What did he say?

1340
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:56,600
Can you throw your nail somewhere?

1341
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:57,880
I don't think so.

1342
00:53:58,540 --> 00:53:59,400
Oh, I can.

1343
00:53:59,520 --> 00:53:59,980
Here, I can.

1344
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:00,380
Yeah.

1345
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:04,220
There you go.

1346
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:04,880
You're welcome.

1347
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:06,320
Huh?

1348
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:08,880
Okay, here you go.

1349
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:10,360
It's time for you to do your job.

1350
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,220
Hey, why put my other nail?

1351
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:15,980
Did you not grab it back?

1352
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:17,940
No, I don't think I get it back.

1353
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:19,040
I think I have to like...

1354
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:22,240
take it and then like do it really fast.

1355
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:26,720
Yeah, I have to do that.

1356
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:28,420
Oh wait, you don't even need me.

1357
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,380
Yeah, I don't.

1358
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:32,920
You have to do over there.

1359
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:36,880
Uh...

1360
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:39,300
Come now.

1361
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:40,800
Oh, here, here, here.

1362
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:43,560
Oh, wait.

1363
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:43,840
What?

1364
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:45,660
No.

1365
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:47,100
What do I do?

1366
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:47,560
Stay here?

1367
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:48,820
Oh, okay.

1368
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:49,400
Don't worry.

1369
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:50,020
I figured it out.

1370
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:52,000
You're welcome.

1371
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,020
And then...

1372
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:54,580
Oops.

1373
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:57,720
Oh, I got two nails!

1374
00:54:59,260 --> 00:54:59,660
Oh.

1375
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:00,440
Alright.

1376
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:03,100
And then...

1377
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,980
She left it way back where she pulled it out of the platform early.

1378
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:08,220
She left it way back where she pulled it out of the platform early.

1379
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:09,360
I think you're supposed to have three nails.

1380
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,280
I'm supposed to have three nails?

1381
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:13,420
I'm supposed to have three nails?

1382
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:15,160
Yeah, I think you're supposed to have three nails.

1383
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:16,140
No, no, no.

1384
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:16,700
I have two nails.

1385
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:18,760
Oh, you have it now?

1386
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:20,560
Oh, okay.

1387
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:21,400
And then I do it here.

1388
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:23,300
Yeah, I'm good.

1389
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:25,680
Um...

1390
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:27,480
Um...

1391
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,340
Oh, okay.

1392
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,920
I thought I was going to be stuck forever.

1393
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:32,780
I thought I actually soft-locked myself.

1394
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:34,800
I thought I actually soft-locked myself.

1395
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:35,420
Oh, what's this?

1396
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,500
Oh, we have to go here.

1397
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,620
Oh, it's a game for us.

1398
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:43,740
Yeah, what is that?

1399
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:44,600
Flip the switch?

1400
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:47,940
What do I do here?

1401
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:50,460
Shoot at...

1402
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:53,000
Use your hammers on a target to score.

1403
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:53,440
Oh!

1404
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:54,640
Oh!

1405
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:55,240
Oh!

1406
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:59,180
Wait, where's the target though?

1407
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:05,240
This is not fair.

1408
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:07,040
Like...

1409
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:09,040
You just have to hammer.

1410
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:09,600
I have to aim.

1411
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,340
Oh, God.

1412
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:17,920
Yeah!

1413
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:22,240
FPS, bitch!

1414
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:24,100
That's what you're like.

1415
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:26,260
That's fucking right.

1416
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:29,540
I have to aim with a controller.

1417
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,260
I'm not a controller player.

1418
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:31,940
I'm not a controller player.

1419
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,840
I have to run.

1420
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:36,360
I have to aim.

1421
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:37,920
What happened to your aim?

1422
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:38,780
I have to aim.

1423
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:41,780
You don't have to aim with a...

1424
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:43,720
You don't have to aim with a hammer.

1425
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:45,940
Oh, my God.

1426
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,580
You have to aim at that.

1427
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:51,860
You have to aim at it, okay?

1428
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:52,600
Yeah!

1429
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:53,620
You have to aim.

1430
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:57,960
Cody, don't screw this up.

1431
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,680
Are you gonna...

1432
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,980
Cody, don't screw this up.

1433
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:03,660
Yeah, yeah.

1434
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:04,640
Just get the jump.

1435
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:05,120
There you go.

1436
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:06,440
You're welcome.

1437
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:08,180
Pull it back.

1438
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:09,120
Pull it back.

1439
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:10,500
There you go.

1440
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:11,160
You're welcome.

1441
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:16,960
Yeah.

1442
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,020
Oh, you're not patient.

1443
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:19,300
You have to be patient.

1444
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:22,340
There you go.

1445
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:23,180
See?

1446
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:26,940
You have to be patient there.

1447
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:30,360
You trust me?

1448
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:34,820
You didn't say yes or no.

1449
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:41,140
You didn't answer back.

1450
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:43,800
Nice one!

1451
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:45,880
You pissed me off.

1452
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:47,700
Why?

1453
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,020
I asked you if you trusted me.

1454
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:52,600
You didn't say anything.

1455
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:53,340
You didn't say anything.

1456
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:55,220
How was I supposed to do?

1457
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,080
Oh, what the fuck?

1458
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:00,960
You have to like...

1459
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,540
I have to aim it so that you...

1460
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:07,320
I don't think you can make that actually.

1461
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:08,520
You have to go through another cycle.

1462
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:11,700
The more I got you.

1463
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:13,440
You trust me?

1464
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:18,180
I didn't realize.

1465
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,100
You have to...

1466
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:21,220
Wait, how do you get hit over there?

1467
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:24,000
You have to land up here?

1468
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:25,460
You have to land up here?

1469
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:25,520
You have to land up here?

1470
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:25,540
Oh!

1471
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:27,880
Oh, what?

1472
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:28,980
Wait, what?

1473
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:30,500
I have to jump early.

1474
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:31,820
I have to go early.

1475
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:33,420
Oh, okay.

1476
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:36,880
So it wasn't my fault.

1477
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:38,720
Oh, but...

1478
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:39,040
Okay.

1479
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:40,120
Oh, whoops.

1480
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:43,520
Wait, where are you...

1481
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,300
Oh, it's here.

1482
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:48,080
Alright, I'm here now.

1483
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:53,540
Oh, here you go.

1484
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:55,240
Three nails.

1485
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:55,540
What the fuck?

1486
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:56,580
How do I...

1487
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:57,660
Oh, I got three nails.

1488
00:58:57,780 --> 00:58:57,980
Nice.

1489
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:00,880
I fell down.

1490
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:03,820
How do I get out of here?

1491
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:08,320
Is there anything on your side?

1492
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:13,440
How do I get out of this?

1493
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:14,920
Oh, I can jump?

1494
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:16,840
Oh my god!

1495
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,360
Yeah, I needed the boost.

1496
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:20,080
I got it.

1497
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:21,100
Nice.

1498
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:21,620
I'm here.

1499
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:23,560
Okay.

1500
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,160
Oh, this is easy.

1501
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:29,940
Alright.

1502
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:30,860
I'm here.

1503
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:32,740
And then...

1504
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:33,740
Oh, okay.

1505
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:34,820
And then I do this jump jump.

1506
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:36,880
No, no, you have to do this... No, you have to do the other one.

1507
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:37,500
Oh.

1508
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:38,760
Because I have to wall jump.

1509
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:39,680
Yeah.

1510
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:42,860
Okay, so like what I figured out is that I have to do...

1511
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:47,820
And then...

1512
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:49,480
Yeah, and then I do that.

1513
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:50,220
And then...

1514
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:52,580
And then I put this back here.

1515
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:54,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1516
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:56,480
Yeah, and then I do that.

1517
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:56,800
Nice.

1518
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:57,720
And then...

1519
00:59:58,380 --> 00:59:58,980
Look at that.

1520
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:00,720
God, I'm so good at this game.

1521
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:00,840
Nice.

1522
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:02,580
And then...

1523
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:03,320
Bam.

1524
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:05,660
Nice.

1525
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:07,160
I'm so smart.

1526
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:12,140
Damn, she just liked me for real.

1527
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:14,400
Look, we have good teamwork.

1528
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,280
I don't know about that.

1529
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:17,220
The book said so.

1530
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:20,140
You want to trust that book?

1531
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:20,900
Yeah.

1532
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:21,540
Okay.

1533
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:22,660
I mean...

1534
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:26,660
I mean, he complimented me.

1535
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:28,040
Unlike some people.

1536
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,520
You get it when you deserve it.

1537
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:32,920
Oh!

1538
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,300
What did I deserve?

1539
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:39,640
Oh, what the fuck?

1540
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:40,460
What the fuck?

1541
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:41,100
That's his friend.

1542
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,020
That's his best friend.

1543
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:44,880
It doesn't look like your friend's happy.

1544
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:46,240
Oh.

1545
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:48,040
We have a...

1546
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:48,740
Wow.

1547
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:52,860
Whoa!

1548
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:54,880
Wait, he's shooting at us!

1549
01:00:56,180 --> 01:00:57,440
Oh, we have to run forward!

1550
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:58,120
We have to run forward!

1551
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:01,680
It's parkour!

1552
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:03,720
Stop playing hard to catch!

1553
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:04,680
Um...

1554
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:07,000
I'm still alive?

1555
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,720
You got this!

1556
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:13,060
Do this for us!

1557
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,040
Do this for our child!

1558
01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:16,200
You have to be here!

1559
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:18,720
Do this for our child!

1560
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:20,420
I believe in you!

1561
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:25,320
Alright, I'm here now.

1562
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:27,700
What do we do?

1563
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,100
Oh, I have to go here.

1564
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:31,000
Hahaha!

1565
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:33,900
Hahaha!

1566
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:35,980
I'm on the other side!

1567
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:39,400
What do I do from here?

1568
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:40,300
Oh, I have to do this.

1569
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:44,240
Wait, but what about you?

1570
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:45,840
Will you ever be able to come back?

1571
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:48,160
Is there something you can stick here?

1572
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:50,080
I don't know.

1573
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:52,300
I guess I'll just...

1574
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:55,880
Do I just wait here for you?

1575
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:57,980
Oh, I think I should have helped you.

1576
01:01:58,960 --> 01:01:59,360
No!

1577
01:01:59,360 --> 01:01:59,660
Yes!

1578
01:01:59,680 --> 01:01:59,940
See?

1579
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:00,840
You don't need me!

1580
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:02,420
Hahaha!

1581
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:03,780
Oh!

1582
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:04,920
Hahaha!

1583
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:10,140
You didn't need me!

1584
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:11,320
Oh!

1585
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:12,740
I'm dead.

1586
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:16,740
I'm coming back!

1587
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:18,080
Oh my god!

1588
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:19,060
I have to run all the way back!

1589
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:19,980
Give me a sec!

1590
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:21,280
I'm coming back!

1591
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:26,380
Give me a sec!

1592
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:28,300
I'm coming over!

1593
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:30,320
Don't worry, honey!

1594
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:31,680
I'm coming over!

1595
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:32,860
Hahaha!

1596
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:34,760
There you go!

1597
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,100
There you go!

1598
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:39,420
You're welcome!

1599
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:42,500
There, see?

1600
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,300
I did it!

1601
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:47,160
I'm doing it!

1602
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:53,520
Alright, we need to hammer this.

1603
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:57,240
Oh!

1604
01:02:58,100 --> 01:02:58,740
Hahaha!

1605
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:00,080
That's my bad.

1606
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:01,300
I pressed the wrong input!

1607
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:02,060
Hahaha!

1608
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:04,620
Don't die like me!

1609
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:05,840
I never died.

1610
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:07,980
You have to put a nail in it, Doki!

1611
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:09,880
You have to hammer it first!

1612
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,200
You have to put a nail in it from far!

1613
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:14,480
You have to hammer it first!

1614
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:14,800
No, it's fine.

1615
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:15,820
See?

1616
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:16,680
You still made it!

1617
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:19,960
You still made it!

1618
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:22,820
Look, you're just making this harder for us.

1619
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:23,520
What about our speedrun?

1620
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:24,880
What about our speedrun?

1621
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:26,820
I'm speedrunning!

1622
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:27,380
I'm running!

1623
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:29,460
Push out!

1624
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:30,280
Push out!

1625
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:31,260
Put a nail in it!

1626
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:32,000
I'm trying!

1627
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:34,360
You're not making it!

1628
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:35,880
Hahaha!

1629
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:39,860
Now I know why we're getting a divorce.

1630
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:40,680
Hahaha!

1631
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:41,260
I know why.

1632
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:42,400
I've been knowing why.

1633
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:44,220
Now I know why.

1634
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:45,880
Now I know why.

1635
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:46,760
Do this transformer!

1636
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:52,600
Bro, I thought he liked his friends!

1637
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:54,140
Yeah!

1638
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:55,260
I think this guy...

1639
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:55,460
Oh!

1640
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:56,420
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1641
01:03:56,620 --> 01:03:57,800
I think this guy lied.

1642
01:03:58,300 --> 01:03:58,740
Ow!

1643
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:00,380
Okay.

1644
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:01,840
I'll put a nail in it!

1645
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:03,800
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1646
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:05,620
I did everything I can!

1647
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:11,440
Bro, I don't think this guy wants him to be friends with him anymore.

1648
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:16,440
Oh, what's he gonna do?

1649
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:17,540
Smash you with the shovel?

1650
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,660
Oh, he flipped you off!

1651
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:26,120
Oh, we can't suck the eyes off him.

1652
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:26,460
Whoa!

1653
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:30,580
Wait, why isn't that tool...

1654
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:32,140
Why doesn't that tool have eyes?

1655
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:34,180
He's cutting holes in the floor.

1656
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:35,760
Oh, I don't like that.

1657
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:40,660
Where the fuck is the...

1658
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:42,240
Can I just like...

1659
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:42,820
Ow!

1660
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:45,080
Ow!

1661
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:51,640
Okay, don't worry, I can do this.

1662
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:54,400
I was caught by surprise.

1663
01:04:56,580 --> 01:04:59,060
Wait, do I have to like...

1664
01:04:59,060 --> 01:04:59,640
Oh, he's coming!

1665
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:00,080
He's swiping!

1666
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:00,580
He's swiping!

1667
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:02,440
Oh!

1668
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:04,280
I'm throwing!

1669
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:07,600
Your fucking thick head blocked my nails!

1670
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:11,140
Okay, here we go.

1671
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:12,780
We're good, we're good, we're good.

1672
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:14,380
Keep hammering, keep hammering!

1673
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:16,180
You did it!

1674
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:18,540
He doesn't have an arm anymore!

1675
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:22,180
Oh!

1676
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:24,000
Oh, shit!

1677
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:25,900
Holy...

1678
01:05:26,580 --> 01:05:29,000
Oh my god, you're so flexible!

1679
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:30,000
What the fuck?

1680
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,620
I know, I can do this quick!

1681
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:34,440
Because yoga lessons paid off!

1682
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:35,420
Oh!

1683
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:42,400
Oh, he angie!

1684
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:44,360
He angie now!

1685
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:45,680
Oh, what the hell?

1686
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,240
Oh, he's very angie!

1687
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:49,080
How do I...

1688
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:50,060
Um...

1689
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:54,220
Don't worry, I dodged it!

1690
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:55,140
Dodged!

1691
01:05:57,700 --> 01:05:58,460
I'm gaming!

1692
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:00,700
Oh, he's on you!

1693
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:01,600
I just sat near.

1694
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:04,560
Oh, shit!

1695
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:05,880
Oh, it's on you.

1696
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,600
Oh, no, no, no, it would have passed that.

1697
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:08,200
You're the...

1698
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:12,960
Oh!

1699
01:06:14,020 --> 01:06:14,440
Oh!

1700
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:19,020
I was trying to hammer!

1701
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:19,860
Hammer, hammer, hammer!

1702
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:21,380
Get on him!

1703
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:22,140
Get on him!

1704
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:22,960
Get on him!

1705
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:27,620
Break the contract!

1706
01:06:29,540 --> 01:06:30,980
That's why I married you!

1707
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:32,540
You!

1708
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:36,840
You're the one that's supposed to yell the contact clues.

1709
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,380
Hammer, hammer, hammer!

1710
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:38,620
Get on!

1711
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:39,240
Get on!

1712
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:39,820
Get on!

1713
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:41,400
Get off me!

1714
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,300
Jim, you suck!

1715
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:50,200
You didn't tell me the contact clues.

1716
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:52,500
That's what marriage is about!

1717
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:57,680
I don't need to know what marriage is about!

1718
01:06:58,260 --> 01:07:01,240
You're supposed to tell me the contact clue.

1719
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:01,780
Look at the camera!

1720
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:10,280
Look, this is not my fault.

1721
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,720
Marriage is like a teamwork.

1722
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:16,240
And there is no I in team Gumi.

1723
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:18,060
Really?

1724
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:20,400
There's no I.

1725
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:23,020
I have to do quite a bit of communication here.

1726
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:23,880
There's no I.

1727
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:24,860
I don't know.

1728
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:28,140
I don't feel like I understood the context clues in...

1729
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:30,120
Don't die.

1730
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:34,880
Where was my context clues again?

1731
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:36,960
Don't die!

1732
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:37,460
Don't die!

1733
01:07:37,540 --> 01:07:37,800
Don't die!

1734
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:38,240
No!

1735
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:40,020
Hammer!

1736
01:07:40,180 --> 01:07:40,540
Hammer!

1737
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:40,780
Hammer!

1738
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:44,180
There you go.

1739
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:44,720
Are you happy?

1740
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:45,860
Are you happy now?

1741
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:46,360
I got two.

1742
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:52,020
I skipped that thing.

1743
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:52,280
Oh my god!

1744
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:52,420
Our floor!

1745
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:53,180
Our floor!

1746
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:54,140
It's okay.

1747
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:55,540
It won't cut everything.

1748
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:57,140
Right?

1749
01:07:58,140 --> 01:07:58,760
Um...

1750
01:07:58,760 --> 01:07:59,780
Um...

1751
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:00,100
Um...

1752
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:01,960
See?

1753
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:02,940
I told you!

1754
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:04,320
It can't cut everything!

1755
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:07,600
Okay.

1756
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:08,700
That's on you.

1757
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,240
I swear to god.

1758
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:16,820
Don't die!

1759
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:17,680
Don't die!

1760
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:17,740
Don't die!

1761
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:22,640
Where's my fucking wife?

1762
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:26,540
There you go.

1763
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:31,820
Easy.

1764
01:08:39,450 --> 01:08:40,130
Nice.

1765
01:08:40,410 --> 01:08:40,930
You see?

1766
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:41,570
We did it.

1767
01:08:41,770 --> 01:08:42,450
Teamwork.

1768
01:08:42,490 --> 01:08:44,330
Why do the other tools not have eyes?

1769
01:08:45,150 --> 01:08:45,830
Like...

1770
01:08:47,030 --> 01:08:47,710
Eww!

1771
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:48,850
Oh god!

1772
01:08:51,130 --> 01:08:52,310
Oh god.

1773
01:08:52,410 --> 01:08:52,810
Oh!

1774
01:08:54,930 --> 01:08:56,730
I don't like that.

1775
01:08:57,210 --> 01:08:59,190
I don't like that at all.

1776
01:09:00,450 --> 01:09:01,130
Oh.

1777
01:09:01,130 --> 01:09:01,470
Oh.

1778
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:02,150
Oh.

1779
01:09:02,150 --> 01:09:02,430
Look at me!

1780
01:09:02,550 --> 01:09:03,210
I'm whole!

1781
01:09:03,470 --> 01:09:04,310
I'm whole!

1782
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:07,610
You saved us from that Rust in Toolbox!

1783
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:08,270
They're all blind.

1784
01:09:08,810 --> 01:09:09,390
Thank you, Mei!

1785
01:09:09,750 --> 01:09:11,670
You are a true hero!

1786
01:09:11,950 --> 01:09:12,390
Oh...

1787
01:09:12,390 --> 01:09:13,270
Thank you, Mei.

1788
01:09:13,270 --> 01:09:15,110
Yeah, I'm a true hero.

1789
01:09:15,490 --> 01:09:16,430
Wait, what about me?

1790
01:09:16,670 --> 01:09:17,630
I did all the work.

1791
01:09:18,150 --> 01:09:18,270
What did you do?

1792
01:09:18,270 --> 01:09:19,110
Did you see that explosion?

1793
01:09:19,350 --> 01:09:20,790
Anyway, we still have to get to Rose.

1794
01:09:21,050 --> 01:09:22,430
Oh of course, of course!

1795
01:09:22,430 --> 01:09:24,150
We did all the work together.

1796
01:09:24,690 --> 01:09:24,950
Can you help us?

1797
01:09:24,950 --> 01:09:26,090
They have to get to the other side.

1798
01:09:28,190 --> 01:09:28,630
Ew!

1799
01:09:28,630 --> 01:09:29,010
Ew.

1800
01:09:33,530 --> 01:09:34,170
Yeah,

1801
01:09:37,230 --> 01:09:38,610
it does not feel safe at all.

1802
01:09:41,730 --> 01:09:44,370
I don't think that's how physics works.

1803
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,340
Rose, look down!

1804
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:57,920
Gamers, look down!

1805
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:04,800
What the fuck, asshole?

1806
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:05,940
What the fuck?

1807
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:06,640
Bro!

1808
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:13,500
The moment we turn into human form, we burn the book.

1809
01:10:13,740 --> 01:10:14,420
For real?

1810
01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:17,720
And we never buy books for a child again.

1811
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:19,380
Oh, wait, pause.

1812
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:24,560
Learning was a mistake.

1813
01:10:26,140 --> 01:10:27,940
Okay, that's why I'm the engineer.

1814
01:10:33,340 --> 01:10:37,060
They turn into dolls and now she questions the science?

1815
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:40,260
That's true.

1816
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:42,380
Oh, we can skate now!

1817
01:10:44,580 --> 01:10:46,000
I'm a skater boy.

1818
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:50,000
Oh, jump.

1819
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:55,400
I fucked up.

1820
01:10:55,580 --> 01:10:57,920
I fucked up.

1821
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:04,060
How far is this fucking thing?

1822
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:05,520
I'm pretty good at this.

1823
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:06,520
Me too.

1824
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:07,380
Woo!

1825
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:08,260
Woo!

1826
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:09,360
Woo!

1827
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:17,900
Woo!

1828
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:19,000
It's like Tony Hawk.

1829
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:19,940
Skater boy.

1830
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:20,760
Yeah!

1831
01:11:26,230 --> 01:11:28,310
Oh, my God, how long is this?

1832
01:11:29,130 --> 01:11:29,990
There's another one.

1833
01:11:30,170 --> 01:11:31,310
There's another one?

1834
01:11:35,270 --> 01:11:36,690
Oh, my God, I'm almost there.

1835
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:37,870
I almost caught up to you.

1836
01:11:38,490 --> 01:11:40,470
Oh, my God, I have to wait for you.

1837
01:11:40,570 --> 01:11:41,910
I almost caught up to you.

1838
01:11:41,910 --> 01:11:43,230
Don't worry, here I am.

1839
01:11:43,650 --> 01:11:44,850
Okay, stay right there.

1840
01:11:44,970 --> 01:11:45,710
Stay right there.

1841
01:11:48,310 --> 01:11:48,710
Hello.

1842
01:11:48,710 --> 01:11:48,950
Hello.

1843
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:50,590
I'm with you.

1844
01:11:53,170 --> 01:11:54,290
There you go, you're welcome.

1845
01:11:55,650 --> 01:11:56,650
I turned it on.

1846
01:11:59,070 --> 01:11:59,550
Wait.

1847
01:12:02,170 --> 01:12:02,650
You...

1848
01:12:03,450 --> 01:12:04,710
You wait right here.

1849
01:12:04,990 --> 01:12:06,190
Okay, you wait right here.

1850
01:12:06,230 --> 01:12:07,710
This one's the shorter path, okay?

1851
01:12:07,790 --> 01:12:09,750
You turn not off when I get over there.

1852
01:12:10,030 --> 01:12:10,510
Okay.

1853
01:12:10,630 --> 01:12:11,070
Okay?

1854
01:12:11,710 --> 01:12:12,190
Okay.

1855
01:12:13,050 --> 01:12:13,530
Okay!

1856
01:12:13,950 --> 01:12:15,030
Go over there!

1857
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:15,990
Go over there!

1858
01:12:16,050 --> 01:12:16,930
Go over there!

1859
01:12:16,930 --> 01:12:18,230
I'm heading over!

1860
01:12:18,350 --> 01:12:18,930
I'm heading over!

1861
01:12:24,070 --> 01:12:24,550
Boom!

1862
01:12:24,550 --> 01:12:25,370
You're welcome.

1863
01:12:26,910 --> 01:12:28,490
Okay, how about you wait...

1864
01:12:28,490 --> 01:12:30,590
How about you wait next to the start?

1865
01:12:30,810 --> 01:12:31,910
How about you go back?

1866
01:12:32,130 --> 01:12:32,830
I'm going!

1867
01:12:36,730 --> 01:12:37,310
I'm here!

1868
01:12:37,390 --> 01:12:37,670
I'm here!

1869
01:12:37,730 --> 01:12:37,990
I'm here!

1870
01:12:40,790 --> 01:12:41,710
I fell down.

1871
01:12:44,470 --> 01:12:45,350
We did!

1872
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:47,910
Yay!

1873
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:48,890
I pressed it.

1874
01:12:49,450 --> 01:12:49,930
Woah!

1875
01:12:50,130 --> 01:12:50,870
We're so close!

1876
01:12:50,890 --> 01:12:51,450
We're coordinated!

1877
01:12:52,710 --> 01:12:53,710
Look at us!

1878
01:12:54,450 --> 01:12:55,950
This is why we're a couple!

1879
01:12:56,630 --> 01:12:57,450
I died.

1880
01:12:58,470 --> 01:12:59,470
I died.

1881
01:13:02,830 --> 01:13:04,370
We... I need you back here!

1882
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:05,150
It stopped!

1883
01:13:05,550 --> 01:13:05,910
We...

1884
01:13:06,350 --> 01:13:07,450
Oh, hey, thank you.

1885
01:13:07,530 --> 01:13:07,950
I don't...

1886
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:11,450
Wait, I can just let you do everything and I can just respawn next to you.

1887
01:13:12,470 --> 01:13:12,990
What?

1888
01:13:16,570 --> 01:13:17,090
Yeah?

1889
01:13:17,370 --> 01:13:17,590
Yeah?

1890
01:13:18,370 --> 01:13:18,510
Yeah?

1891
01:13:19,790 --> 01:13:20,870
Do you need me to come over?

1892
01:13:20,870 --> 01:13:20,870
Do you need me to come over?

1893
01:13:20,870 --> 01:13:21,250
Thank you for that!

1894
01:13:22,530 --> 01:13:23,470
Do you need me?

1895
01:13:25,450 --> 01:13:26,670
I think I need you.

1896
01:13:27,610 --> 01:13:29,910
Okay, I'm here now.

1897
01:13:31,390 --> 01:13:32,070
I'm here.

1898
01:13:35,710 --> 01:13:36,750
Gumi, Gumi carry!

1899
01:13:36,930 --> 01:13:38,530
Gumi and Doki carry.

1900
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:41,250
Oh!

1901
01:13:41,290 --> 01:13:42,250
Oh, more eyes!

1902
01:13:44,010 --> 01:13:45,970
This game has a weird obsession with eyes.

1903
01:13:46,070 --> 01:13:46,750
It does.

1904
01:13:47,210 --> 01:13:47,710
Same.

1905
01:13:50,870 --> 01:13:53,230
You are... nothing escapes my lenses.

1906
01:13:53,850 --> 01:13:54,210
Look!

1907
01:13:55,490 --> 01:13:56,610
Wait, in here?

1908
01:13:56,770 --> 01:13:57,670
Alright, okay.

1909
01:13:58,930 --> 01:13:59,430
Let's see.

1910
01:14:01,590 --> 01:14:02,250
That's a human!

1911
01:14:02,570 --> 01:14:03,090
Is he...

1912
01:14:03,750 --> 01:14:04,110
That's him!

1913
01:14:05,130 --> 01:14:05,670
That's me?

1914
01:14:05,970 --> 01:14:06,170
Am I dead?

1915
01:14:06,630 --> 01:14:07,850
You're not dead!

1916
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:10,210
What's going on?

1917
01:14:10,330 --> 01:14:11,350
Yeah, what's going on?

1918
01:14:11,470 --> 01:14:11,870
Where's she?

1919
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:12,570
Where are you?

1920
01:14:13,530 --> 01:14:14,250
You're streaming.

1921
01:14:14,570 --> 01:14:15,250
I'm taking a little nappy.

1922
01:14:15,510 --> 01:14:16,070
What's the matter with us?

1923
01:14:16,070 --> 01:14:16,770
Take your little nappy.

1924
01:14:16,950 --> 01:14:17,590
Me, me, me, me, me, me.

1925
01:14:17,890 --> 01:14:20,050
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

1926
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:22,630
And she's just sitting there with her dolls.

1927
01:14:22,950 --> 01:14:25,410
And then you two came alive.

1928
01:14:25,650 --> 01:14:30,190
Also, like, it's weird ... that's a little creepy that there's a binoculars up here.

1929
01:14:30,810 --> 01:14:32,270
Like, who's looking at us?

1930
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:33,370
What happened?

1931
01:14:33,690 --> 01:14:34,710
Bird watching me.

1932
01:14:34,810 --> 01:14:35,130
Huh!

1933
01:14:35,290 --> 01:14:36,190
She was crying.

1934
01:14:37,370 --> 01:14:38,750
Oh my god...

1935
01:14:38,750 --> 01:14:39,930
Who hurt her?

1936
01:14:40,130 --> 01:14:40,930
Can't be us.

1937
01:14:40,970 --> 01:14:41,590
We're good parents.

1938
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:42,210
Yeah.

1939
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:44,710
I bought her $8.00 cereal.

1940
01:14:45,010 --> 01:14:45,670
That's me!

1941
01:14:46,290 --> 01:14:46,950
Oh my god.

1942
01:14:48,470 --> 01:14:49,470
That's me!

1943
01:14:49,470 --> 01:14:49,810
Oh my god!

1944
01:14:49,950 --> 01:14:50,530
That's me!

1945
01:14:50,530 --> 01:14:52,790
She always wanted, every day she gets a new doll.

1946
01:14:53,270 --> 01:14:54,530
What the f*** is that?

1947
01:14:54,530 --> 01:14:55,030
What am I doing?

1948
01:14:57,730 --> 01:14:58,210
No...

1949
01:15:03,190 --> 01:15:07,350
We could be having a nightmare right now.

1950
01:15:23,090 --> 01:15:24,110
I knew it!

1951
01:15:24,330 --> 01:15:25,650
Magic was real!

1952
01:15:26,930 --> 01:15:28,970
You didn't believe in me, Goomy!

1953
01:15:29,690 --> 01:15:33,390
Na na na na na na na na na na na, my little pony!

1954
01:15:34,730 --> 01:15:36,390
I'm a virtual wizard!

1955
01:15:38,370 --> 01:15:39,890
I'm still a wizard?!

1956
01:15:39,890 --> 01:15:40,770
How do we get a kid?

1957
01:15:50,570 --> 01:15:51,610
That's the laugh he did.

1958
01:15:53,770 --> 01:15:55,590
So you settled for me?

1959
01:15:56,470 --> 01:15:59,390
You are an engineer and you married me?

1960
01:16:03,890 --> 01:16:07,330
Sometimes you date and you marry someone because they're funny.

1961
01:16:08,690 --> 01:16:09,870
Am I funny?

1962
01:16:10,170 --> 01:16:11,350
Wait, I'm funny?

1963
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:22,920
What the fuck?

1964
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:23,520
Creep?

1965
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:27,520
How does she know where exactly our daughter is at all times?

1966
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:31,460
I mean, whose binoculars are these two?

1967
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:34,440
That's facing our house!

1968
01:16:38,210 --> 01:16:39,210
We're outside!

1969
01:16:39,950 --> 01:16:40,730
We're gonna touch grass!

1970
01:16:44,170 --> 01:16:45,670
Did you watch?

1971
01:16:46,710 --> 01:16:48,950
It was pretty cool, right?

1972
01:16:49,730 --> 01:16:51,010
What the fuck?

1973
01:16:53,130 --> 01:16:53,850
Eww!

1974
01:17:02,650 --> 01:17:05,430
Lock distance initiatives do work!

1975
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:09,430
Bro, I just wanna punch it.

1976
01:17:09,790 --> 01:17:10,390
Yeah.

1977
01:17:13,610 --> 01:17:15,370
Oh, we got rope powers!

1978
01:17:16,210 --> 01:17:18,030
I had it outburst and I had to say it.

1979
01:17:20,570 --> 01:17:21,770
Alright, let's swing across!

1980
01:17:22,910 --> 01:17:24,030
Oh, that's easy!

1981
01:17:24,570 --> 01:17:25,650
That tree is huge!

1982
01:17:26,190 --> 01:17:27,110
Don't worry about it!

1983
01:17:27,170 --> 01:17:29,130
The ropes will take us to Rose in an instant!

1984
01:17:30,030 --> 01:17:31,890
Sorry, I was looking at the ladybugs.

1985
01:17:32,030 --> 01:17:33,230
Yeah, I was looking at the ants.

1986
01:17:34,570 --> 01:17:36,290
Okay, we don't jump that way, by the way.

1987
01:17:36,310 --> 01:17:37,390
We don't jump the left side.

1988
01:17:37,570 --> 01:17:38,590
It's the right side.

1989
01:17:39,450 --> 01:17:40,810
It's the other side.

1990
01:17:42,030 --> 01:17:43,790
It's the side I didn't look at.

1991
01:17:43,790 --> 01:17:44,870
Oh, there's a plane!

1992
01:17:45,250 --> 01:17:46,090
Look at this!

1993
01:17:46,110 --> 01:17:46,410
Where?

1994
01:17:46,870 --> 01:17:47,590
Right here!

1995
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:48,750
Oh, throw it!

1996
01:17:48,910 --> 01:17:49,290
Throw it!

1997
01:17:49,370 --> 01:17:50,290
Where do I throw it?

1998
01:17:51,070 --> 01:17:52,630
Oh, no, wherever you want!

1999
01:17:52,890 --> 01:17:53,410
Okay.

2000
01:17:53,810 --> 01:17:54,370
Weeeeee!

2001
01:17:57,630 --> 01:17:58,190
Weeeeee!

2002
01:17:58,810 --> 01:18:00,030
Where is it going?

2003
01:18:00,230 --> 01:18:01,370
We'll never know.

2004
01:18:01,990 --> 01:18:04,530
Um, did you build a treehouse for Rose?

2005
01:18:04,810 --> 01:18:05,110
No.

2006
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:06,430
Why do you ask?

2007
01:18:06,710 --> 01:18:07,510
There are windows.

2008
01:18:08,390 --> 01:18:09,450
There's windows?

2009
01:18:09,910 --> 01:18:10,450
Yeah.

2010
01:18:11,090 --> 01:18:11,650
Oh.

2011
01:18:11,650 --> 01:18:13,190
Who lives there?

2012
01:18:14,630 --> 01:18:15,710
I don't know.

2013
01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:16,630
Tree people, I guess.

2014
01:18:16,870 --> 01:18:17,470
They exist?

2015
01:18:17,910 --> 01:18:20,450
I mean, if magic exists, tree people exist too, right?

2016
01:18:23,250 --> 01:18:24,670
Why are you not waiting up for me?

2017
01:18:25,150 --> 01:18:26,230
I'm right behind you!

2018
01:18:26,290 --> 01:18:27,810
You told me to throw the paper airplane!

2019
01:18:28,930 --> 01:18:29,330
No, no, no.

2020
01:18:29,350 --> 01:18:30,190
It took 50 years.

2021
01:18:30,870 --> 01:18:35,350
It's a heavy... Look, it's a heavy airplane, okay?

2022
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:38,570
I'm not as jacked as I was before when you married me.

2023
01:18:39,710 --> 01:18:40,190
Okay.

2024
01:18:40,190 --> 01:18:40,210
I'm not going to throw it.

2025
01:18:40,930 --> 01:18:47,110
Yeah, that's because all you do is do your farm work and then eat them goddamn potato chips.

2026
01:18:47,350 --> 01:18:50,230
Yeah, but we get fresh potato chips because of meat.

2027
01:18:50,290 --> 01:18:51,850
Those are your favorite potato chips.

2028
01:18:52,170 --> 01:18:54,270
I actually don't like chips.

2029
01:18:54,310 --> 01:18:55,230
So you lied.

2030
01:18:55,450 --> 01:18:56,730
So you lied to my face.

2031
01:18:56,830 --> 01:18:57,790
I don't like chips at all.

2032
01:18:58,170 --> 01:18:58,910
You lied...

2033
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:12,160
I don't like chips.

2034
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:13,100
You're welcome.

2035
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:14,180
I grew those.

2036
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:16,960
I'm going to put them on.

2037
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:17,900
All I need are rice crackers.

2038
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:19,220
All I need are rice crackers.

2039
01:19:19,860 --> 01:19:21,480
You see how far away it is?

2040
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:24,160
I think lying isn't good for a marriage, you know?

2041
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:26,420
I'm going to put them on.

2042
01:19:26,420 --> 01:19:26,840
I'm going to eat..

2043
01:19:33,780 --> 01:19:35,000
What's inside there?

2044
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,480
You're so lucky I had only one cracker left on my table.

2045
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:37,720
Oh, a table.

2046
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:39,820
That was perfect timing.

2047
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:41,120
What the fuck?

2048
01:19:41,340 --> 01:19:42,400
Oh my god, it's a fucking rat.

2049
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,120
Dude, I think that's a squirrel.

2050
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:46,520
No, it's a fucking rat.

2051
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:49,500
Squirrels are just tree rats.

2052
01:19:51,780 --> 01:19:55,220
What the fuck?

2053
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:56,100
What the fuck?

2054
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:56,940
Where did he get the jar?

2055
01:19:58,860 --> 01:20:00,620
You know what happens when wearing a jar?

2056
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:02,880
No, no, no.

2057
01:20:03,020 --> 01:20:04,540
Please elaborate what happens.

2058
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:05,280
Rainbow Dash.

2059
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:09,880
What is the context of that?

2060
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:10,480
What is that?

2061
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:14,200
Why is there white goop in here?

2062
01:20:14,620 --> 01:20:15,060
Glue?

2063
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:15,800
Isn't that glue?

2064
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:17,200
Look, it's like arts and crafts.

2065
01:20:17,220 --> 01:20:18,300
Why do you have glue in here?

2066
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:19,500
It's like arts and crafts.

2067
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:21,740
Oh my god, she's talking to you.

2068
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:22,600
I just wanted to tell you something.

2069
01:20:22,820 --> 01:20:23,420
It's important.

2070
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:29,260
Have you heard of this book by Dr. Hakim?

2071
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:33,820
He says that it's important to forgive each other.

2072
01:20:35,020 --> 01:20:36,680
This is so fucked up.

2073
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:37,360
We've become friends.

2074
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:37,460
We've become friends.

2075
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:44,680
Imagine like you're a daughter talking to your dad about something important.

2076
01:20:44,780 --> 01:20:46,380
He's just sitting there ignoring your ass.

2077
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:48,220
Oh, that is... that's trauma.

2078
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:48,860
It's okay.

2079
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:50,760
She's already gonna get therapy anyway.

2080
01:20:50,980 --> 01:20:51,740
This is just gonna be...

2081
01:20:51,740 --> 01:20:51,920
It's okay.

2082
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:52,420
You're busy.

2083
01:20:52,820 --> 01:20:53,260
Sorry.

2084
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:54,300
It's okay.

2085
01:20:54,580 --> 01:20:56,040
She's already getting therapy anyway.

2086
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:57,060
It's a two-for-one deal.

2087
01:20:57,820 --> 01:20:58,260
Oh.

2088
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:01,580
Yeah, she might as well.

2089
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:05,020
Like the extra trauma doesn't matter.

2090
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:06,460
What the fuck?

2091
01:21:13,020 --> 01:21:14,160
What the fuck?

2092
01:21:14,180 --> 01:21:15,220
We're getting interrogated.

2093
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:18,440
Are you in with the wasps?

2094
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:19,100
Are you in with the wasps?

2095
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:20,640
The wasps versus tree rats?

2096
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:21,920
What?

2097
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:23,120
Kill you?

2098
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:23,380
No.

2099
01:21:23,660 --> 01:21:25,240
We're not working for any wasps.

2100
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:27,140
We'll see you, Sigeron.

2101
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:29,660
Pull the switch.

2102
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:31,140
You got it, chief.

2103
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:32,560
Oh my god, what?

2104
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:34,080
They're gonna kill us.

2105
01:21:34,740 --> 01:21:35,480
Get away!

2106
01:21:35,580 --> 01:21:35,880
Get away!

2107
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:36,440
Oh!

2108
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:42,960
We're unkillable.

2109
01:21:43,860 --> 01:21:44,720
That's crazy.

2110
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:45,040
That's crazy.

2111
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:45,040
That's crazy.

2112
01:21:45,060 --> 01:21:45,940
They're just watching the shit.

2113
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:46,600
Yeah, I know.

2114
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:48,200
That's another issue here.

2115
01:21:55,590 --> 01:21:57,170
They wanted us to die.

2116
01:21:58,710 --> 01:22:02,530
Why would we help them after they tried to kill us multiple times?

2117
01:22:04,010 --> 01:22:04,990
Let's find out.

2118
01:22:05,610 --> 01:22:07,070
I'll only do it for money.

2119
01:22:07,990 --> 01:22:08,510
What?

2120
01:22:09,050 --> 01:22:10,250
That was terrible.

2121
01:22:10,810 --> 01:22:11,330
Horrendous.

2122
01:22:13,730 --> 01:22:15,830
Is this Alvin and the Chick Monks?

2123
01:22:17,630 --> 01:22:18,850
There's three of them!

2124
01:22:19,270 --> 01:22:22,690
There's Alvin, Theodore, and the other one.

2125
01:22:22,790 --> 01:22:22,810
Oh, right!

2126
01:22:22,810 --> 01:22:23,430
Dude, this gotta be Alvin!

2127
01:22:23,690 --> 01:22:24,930
That has to be Alvin!

2128
01:22:25,070 --> 01:22:26,350
He looks like an Alvin.

2129
01:22:28,450 --> 01:22:31,230
Wait, where did the chairs go?

2130
01:22:31,610 --> 01:22:32,930
Does it disappear with us?

2131
01:22:33,410 --> 01:22:36,670
I think the fucking wasp got sucked up in it.

2132
01:22:36,950 --> 01:22:37,810
I think the fucking wasp got sucked up in it.

2133
01:22:37,810 --> 01:22:38,910
I think the fucking wasp got sucked up in it.

2134
01:22:39,590 --> 01:22:42,050
Why the fuck was he holding his pod?

2135
01:22:42,110 --> 01:22:43,290
Why the fuck was he holding his pod?

2136
01:22:43,290 --> 01:22:44,610
Oh, did you see he has a machete?

2137
01:22:45,830 --> 01:22:47,410
Yeah, it's not like they could have guns.

2138
01:22:47,670 --> 01:22:49,810
It must be like a broken knife or some shit.

2139
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:56,700
Oh, it's like... look at that tiny knife!

2140
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:57,680
Awwww!

2141
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:00,060
Look, it's Simon!

2142
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:02,020
Oh my god!

2143
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:03,820
Simon, Theodore, and Alvin!

2144
01:23:07,340 --> 01:23:08,540
Fucking rats.

2145
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:10,180
And look, Theodore!

2146
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:14,640
What the fuck?

2147
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:16,760
They made shrines out of them.

2148
01:23:18,260 --> 01:23:18,880
Oh, she's...

2149
01:23:19,820 --> 01:23:20,340
Oh!

2150
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:24,440
What's your Oshie mark in this?

2151
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:25,760
Is that my Oshie mark?

2152
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:27,680
The nail, of course.

2153
01:23:28,620 --> 01:23:29,140
Oh!

2154
01:23:29,140 --> 01:23:30,340
Mine is glasses.

2155
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:33,880
Yeah!

2156
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:34,160
Tree...

2157
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:34,900
Wait, they have a TV?

2158
01:23:36,180 --> 01:23:37,440
Dude, they stole our TV!

2159
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:39,420
Bro, what the fuck?

2160
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:40,840
How smart are these tree rats?

2161
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:44,600
The wasps have invaded our tree and wiped out most of our tribe.

2162
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:45,760
Oh!

2163
01:23:46,340 --> 01:23:47,940
That's a pocket knife that he has.

2164
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:49,840
What?

2165
01:23:50,580 --> 01:23:52,860
We can't kill those crazy creatures.

2166
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:53,440
You nuts!

2167
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:59,440
I did not realize there was like a actual war going on.

2168
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:04,400
Like, this game had something to do with like war between squirrels and wasps.

2169
01:24:05,300 --> 01:24:05,820
What?

2170
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:07,760
Does this mean it's gonna get Call of Duty?

2171
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:09,140
Oh my god!

2172
01:24:09,180 --> 01:24:10,380
It's gonna get Call of Duty!

2173
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:12,620
Of course, I get the gun.

2174
01:24:14,540 --> 01:24:15,060
Oh!

2175
01:24:18,990 --> 01:24:20,890
I get the fucking bazooka, bitch!

2176
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:21,910
You get that?

2177
01:24:21,930 --> 01:24:22,910
Hehehehehe!

2178
01:24:23,290 --> 01:24:26,830
We sent in an undercover agent who would operate our mean robot.

2179
01:24:28,130 --> 01:24:31,750
As planned, the wasps believed the robot was their real queen.

2180
01:24:31,950 --> 01:24:37,510
But instead of wiping out the wasps, our agent was seduced by its power and switched sides.

2181
01:24:37,670 --> 01:24:38,270
Aaaaah!

2182
01:24:38,830 --> 01:24:41,310
So, kill the wasps...

2183
01:24:41,310 --> 01:24:41,930
Oh my god!

2184
01:24:43,850 --> 01:24:45,050
The agent...

2185
01:24:45,050 --> 01:24:46,290
went rogue.

2186
01:24:46,990 --> 01:24:51,930
Yeah, sure, but The wasps cannot take our nuts.

2187
01:24:52,550 --> 01:24:54,970
There's no way this game takes 15 hours.

2188
01:24:56,150 --> 01:24:57,090
There's no way.

2189
01:24:57,110 --> 01:24:58,850
We're like speedrunning this shit.

2190
01:24:59,170 --> 01:25:01,510
Yeah, I feel like we're already like 30% way through.

2191
01:25:01,910 --> 01:25:05,110
How much have we finished in this game, guys?

2192
01:25:06,610 --> 01:25:08,790
We got through two bosses already?

2193
01:25:09,310 --> 01:25:11,470
The vacuum and the toolbox?

2194
01:25:11,690 --> 01:25:13,350
Yeah, in within an hour and 30 minutes.

2195
01:25:19,290 --> 01:25:22,070
We're not even at 10% of the game.

2196
01:25:22,650 --> 01:25:44,490
You never take anything I do seriously!

2197
01:25:49,510 --> 01:25:50,190
Yeah!

2198
01:25:50,190 --> 01:25:51,170
Me too!

2199
01:25:52,170 --> 01:25:56,550
The divorce happened early.

2200
01:25:57,050 --> 01:25:57,930
Look at that!

2201
01:25:58,250 --> 01:26:00,910
They answered our prayers.

2202
01:26:06,790 --> 01:26:09,350
Apparently we just completed chapter one.

2203
01:26:09,530 --> 01:26:11,570
That was actually chapter one.

2204
01:26:13,730 --> 01:26:15,170
Okay, how does this work?

2205
01:26:20,290 --> 01:26:21,210
That's not fair.

2206
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:22,930
Why do you get the cool zone?

2207
01:26:27,610 --> 01:26:28,610
Poor Emma.

2208
01:26:28,870 --> 01:26:29,390
What the hell?

2209
01:26:34,930 --> 01:26:36,110
Are you not here yet?

2210
01:26:36,350 --> 01:26:36,650
Oh.

2211
01:26:37,910 --> 01:26:39,310
I was testing out my gun.

2212
01:26:45,550 --> 01:26:46,050
Oh!

2213
01:26:52,170 --> 01:26:54,190
My thing is like fuel!

2214
01:26:56,610 --> 01:26:58,850
Okay, shoot it at the pile of sticks over there.

2215
01:26:58,870 --> 01:27:00,010
My thing is like fuel!

2216
01:27:00,210 --> 01:27:03,230
Okay, shoot it at the pile of sticks over there.

2217
01:27:06,350 --> 01:27:08,210
See, this is why we're good together.

2218
01:27:08,470 --> 01:27:09,710
Here are the context clues.

2219
01:27:12,110 --> 01:27:14,050
I'll just watch you fire that shit away!

2220
01:27:14,590 --> 01:27:16,310
Here are the context clues!

2221
01:27:16,510 --> 01:27:17,030
What do you mean?

2222
01:27:17,310 --> 01:27:17,690
Over here!

2223
01:27:18,930 --> 01:27:20,470
You give me the clues!

2224
01:27:23,070 --> 01:27:23,830
What is this?

2225
01:27:26,590 --> 01:27:28,010
Oh, it's the practice.

2226
01:27:28,110 --> 01:27:29,150
We don't need practice.

2227
01:27:29,150 --> 01:27:29,750
We're good.

2228
01:27:29,930 --> 01:27:30,670
We're good at this.

2229
01:27:31,250 --> 01:27:32,530
We don't need practice.

2230
01:27:32,670 --> 01:27:34,110
I already got it down.

2231
01:27:35,470 --> 01:27:36,210
See, look.

2232
01:27:37,870 --> 01:27:39,910
There, see?

2233
01:27:40,050 --> 01:27:40,610
Look at that.

2234
01:27:40,750 --> 01:27:42,050
No practice needed.

2235
01:27:48,690 --> 01:27:49,170
Umm...

2236
01:27:50,330 --> 01:27:52,490
Do I have to go there too?

2237
01:27:53,490 --> 01:27:54,190
Wait, what?

2238
01:27:56,190 --> 01:27:57,150
Yeah, I'm pretty sure you have to go through.

2239
01:27:57,450 --> 01:27:57,590
Yeah.

2240
01:27:58,930 --> 01:28:00,910
Yeah, I didn't know if there was something I had to do over there.

2241
01:28:01,150 --> 01:28:02,230
Then I can...

2242
01:28:02,930 --> 01:28:03,930
put this down.

2243
01:28:04,930 --> 01:28:05,630
See, look.

2244
01:28:05,830 --> 01:28:06,470
I did it.

2245
01:28:07,450 --> 01:28:09,030
The muscle can think sometimes.

2246
01:28:09,410 --> 01:28:09,650
Oh!

2247
01:28:11,910 --> 01:28:13,950
I don't think we needed to do that, but okay.

2248
01:28:16,690 --> 01:28:17,650
Oh, wait, we do!

2249
01:28:17,890 --> 01:28:19,270
We have to launch... Oh, wait, it's up here!

2250
01:28:20,230 --> 01:28:20,930
It's up here.

2251
01:28:21,150 --> 01:28:22,590
Yeah, I didn't need to do that.

2252
01:28:25,030 --> 01:28:26,930
Yeah, and then you have to blast the target.

2253
01:28:29,690 --> 01:28:30,210
Yay!

2254
01:28:33,530 --> 01:28:34,050
Progress!

2255
01:28:37,070 --> 01:28:41,670
This is like just very... This tree must be dying because it's so empty on the inside.

2256
01:28:42,610 --> 01:28:43,130
Yeah.

2257
01:28:43,670 --> 01:28:47,350
I mean, they're at war right now, so...

2258
01:28:47,350 --> 01:28:48,470
The grass?

2259
01:28:48,930 --> 01:28:49,710
The grass?

2260
01:28:50,570 --> 01:28:52,110
Look, I was getting there.

2261
01:28:52,210 --> 01:28:52,570
I was getting there.

2262
01:28:53,130 --> 01:28:54,410
I don't need it!

2263
01:28:57,930 --> 01:29:01,110
I was about to... I was about to shoot it!

2264
01:29:01,610 --> 01:29:03,010
You just had to be patient!

2265
01:29:08,570 --> 01:29:10,170
Okay, and then I think you have to destroy it.

2266
01:29:10,410 --> 01:29:10,850
Yeah.

2267
01:29:11,590 --> 01:29:12,410
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2268
01:29:12,810 --> 01:29:13,870
Don't worry, I got you.

2269
01:29:14,470 --> 01:29:14,910
Okay.

2270
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:26,960
Uh...

2271
01:29:30,580 --> 01:29:31,580
Oh, it's over there!

2272
01:29:31,720 --> 01:29:32,420
You just had to hit it!

2273
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:34,320
Hit what?

2274
01:29:34,780 --> 01:29:35,440
Isn't that?

2275
01:29:37,660 --> 01:29:38,880
Yeah, I've been hitting that.

2276
01:29:41,620 --> 01:29:42,620
Oh, uh...

2277
01:29:43,460 --> 01:29:44,680
Wait, lower it again.

2278
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:47,060
Stupid.

2279
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:50,320
Fuck you, man.

2280
01:29:51,460 --> 01:29:54,820
I thought about the answer myself with no help whatsoever.

2281
01:29:55,540 --> 01:29:56,500
Wait, hey!

2282
01:29:56,700 --> 01:29:58,120
Every day is a school day!

2283
01:29:58,180 --> 01:29:58,340
Right?

2284
01:29:58,360 --> 01:29:58,740
You're learning!

2285
01:29:59,120 --> 01:29:59,420
Yeah!

2286
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:01,280
Yeah!

2287
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:01,780
Yay!

2288
01:30:04,740 --> 01:30:06,060
I lowered this.

2289
01:30:08,060 --> 01:30:09,300
Wait, it doesn't go through.

2290
01:30:09,540 --> 01:30:10,660
Yeah, the sap isn't sticking.

2291
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:14,760
What's this?

2292
01:30:19,780 --> 01:30:20,620
Where are you?

2293
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:25,220
I think you need to weigh this down.

2294
01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:26,880
Up here.

2295
01:30:27,540 --> 01:30:29,500
I think you need to weigh this down.

2296
01:30:30,620 --> 01:30:31,240
Up here.

2297
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:36,380
Good thinking, brains.

2298
01:30:40,010 --> 01:30:41,630
I think you have to blow it up on your end.

2299
01:30:41,630 --> 01:30:42,830
I think you have to weigh it down a little.

2300
01:30:43,090 --> 01:30:44,790
No, I think you have to blow it up on your end.

2301
01:30:45,150 --> 01:30:45,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2302
01:30:47,110 --> 01:30:47,490
See?

2303
01:30:48,610 --> 01:30:49,610
Look at that.

2304
01:30:49,750 --> 01:30:50,410
You need me.

2305
01:30:50,830 --> 01:30:51,750
You need me.

2306
01:30:52,890 --> 01:30:53,270
Okay.

2307
01:30:53,390 --> 01:30:54,170
You need me.

2308
01:30:54,890 --> 01:30:55,270
Okay.

2309
01:30:56,210 --> 01:30:56,590
Okay.

2310
01:30:56,770 --> 01:30:56,970
What?

2311
01:30:58,890 --> 01:31:01,270
I think you climb to it and then I turn you.

2312
01:31:02,230 --> 01:31:02,610
Okay.

2313
01:31:02,610 --> 01:31:03,090
Not even...

2314
01:31:03,090 --> 01:31:03,910
Oh, I can grip it.

2315
01:31:03,950 --> 01:31:04,490
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2316
01:31:07,090 --> 01:31:07,450
Nice.

2317
01:31:07,650 --> 01:31:11,470
Okay, and then I... jump on it?

2318
01:31:13,770 --> 01:31:14,130
Yeah.

2319
01:31:14,590 --> 01:31:14,950
Yeah.

2320
01:31:16,110 --> 01:31:16,810
And then what?

2321
01:31:17,510 --> 01:31:19,130
Oh, and then we go through the door.

2322
01:31:19,370 --> 01:31:19,730
Yeah.

2323
01:31:21,210 --> 01:31:22,550
What the fuck is this?

2324
01:31:22,690 --> 01:31:23,150
What is this?

2325
01:31:23,730 --> 01:31:24,710
That's an acorn.

2326
01:31:25,010 --> 01:31:26,230
I'm experimenting on an acorn.

2327
01:31:26,650 --> 01:31:27,730
They really are nuts.

2328
01:31:28,290 --> 01:31:28,650
Ha!

2329
01:31:31,390 --> 01:31:32,430
I don't think that's it.

2330
01:31:32,890 --> 01:31:34,050
No, we have to wait like this.

2331
01:31:34,050 --> 01:31:34,170
Look at that.

2332
01:31:36,270 --> 01:31:36,950
You go...

2333
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:39,110
You jump on and then I push you up.

2334
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:44,700
Yeah, you jump on one of them.

2335
01:31:45,140 --> 01:31:46,400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2336
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:47,760
Can you grip this?

2337
01:31:48,160 --> 01:31:48,720
Oh, okay.

2338
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:49,780
Yeah, I'm pretty...

2339
01:31:49,780 --> 01:31:50,460
Can you grip this?

2340
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:55,160
And then you do a wall jump and stuff.

2341
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:55,860
Can you grip that?

2342
01:31:58,060 --> 01:31:58,740
Okay, sorry.

2343
01:31:59,060 --> 01:31:59,960
That's too far.

2344
01:32:00,020 --> 01:32:00,400
Yeah.

2345
01:32:00,420 --> 01:32:01,400
That's too far.

2346
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:02,600
All right.

2347
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:04,180
Can you grip this?

2348
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:07,800
Alright.

2349
01:32:10,460 --> 01:32:11,180
Yeah, see?

2350
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:13,940
God, I'm so smart.

2351
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:14,940
You're dead.

2352
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:16,800
Yeah.

2353
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:19,600
It didn't stick you for too long.

2354
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:22,360
Okay, don't worry.

2355
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:22,880
I got this.

2356
01:32:26,260 --> 01:32:28,060
It didn't let me on the wall.

2357
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:28,820
Okay.

2358
01:32:30,340 --> 01:32:31,720
This ain't it, apparently.

2359
01:32:33,700 --> 01:32:35,000
Then what is it?

2360
01:32:35,460 --> 01:32:36,780
Oh, there's more here.

2361
01:32:36,920 --> 01:32:37,800
Oh, there's more here.

2362
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:40,120
Oh, you go from here.

2363
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:44,800
Oh!

2364
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:46,020
Okay, blow that up.

2365
01:32:46,100 --> 01:32:46,700
Get on there.

2366
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:49,240
Okay, I figured it out.

2367
01:32:50,060 --> 01:32:51,860
And then you jump on that.

2368
01:32:53,220 --> 01:32:54,900
And now I'm gonna make this heavy.

2369
01:32:57,120 --> 01:32:59,140
Yeah, and then you jump on that.

2370
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:00,960
And then I'm gonna make this heavy.

2371
01:33:03,640 --> 01:33:05,120
Okay, and then I'll do this.

2372
01:33:06,140 --> 01:33:06,620
Okay,

2373
01:33:11,350 --> 01:33:11,350
and then I'll do this.

2374
01:33:11,350 --> 01:33:12,530
I'm running out of ammo.

2375
01:33:14,050 --> 01:33:15,430
I'm running out of ammo.

2376
01:33:17,910 --> 01:33:19,650
It's getting a little too heavy.

2377
01:33:25,810 --> 01:33:27,590
Blow up the one below you.

2378
01:33:27,650 --> 01:33:28,770
Blow up that one below you.

2379
01:33:29,070 --> 01:33:29,250
I can't.

2380
01:33:29,250 --> 01:33:30,510
I can't blow up.

2381
01:33:30,550 --> 01:33:31,170
Blow it up.

2382
01:33:31,430 --> 01:33:32,050
Blow it up.

2383
01:33:32,050 --> 01:33:35,350
It doesn't let me scoop in.

2384
01:33:36,030 --> 01:33:37,030
Oh my god.

2385
01:33:37,150 --> 01:33:37,470
Okay.

2386
01:33:38,290 --> 01:33:38,750
Don't worry.

2387
01:33:38,890 --> 01:33:39,310
I got this.

2388
01:33:39,410 --> 01:33:40,230
I figured it out.

2389
01:33:40,610 --> 01:33:43,530
I'll just keep overloading it.

2390
01:33:43,610 --> 01:33:45,410
I'll overload it and then...

2391
01:33:46,030 --> 01:33:46,910
Okay, I got an idea.

2392
01:33:47,030 --> 01:33:47,450
I got an idea.

2393
01:33:47,550 --> 01:33:49,070
Okay, you go back on the other side.

2394
01:33:49,470 --> 01:33:50,610
Then you blow it up.

2395
01:33:51,650 --> 01:33:52,290
I can't.

2396
01:33:52,730 --> 01:33:54,150
You want me to go all the way home?

2397
01:33:54,270 --> 01:33:54,630
Yeah, no, no.

2398
01:33:54,650 --> 01:33:55,170
Go over here.

2399
01:33:55,230 --> 01:33:56,150
You can't go from here.

2400
01:33:56,290 --> 01:33:57,210
This side of the wall.

2401
01:33:57,210 --> 01:33:57,650
No, I can't.

2402
01:33:57,650 --> 01:33:59,330
I can't shoot while I'm on this.

2403
01:33:59,410 --> 01:33:59,910
Oh, okay.

2404
01:34:00,430 --> 01:34:00,890
It's okay.

2405
01:34:01,490 --> 01:34:06,650
I will spill so much goo that it will have to go down.

2406
01:34:07,250 --> 01:34:08,250
There's no way.

2407
01:34:08,470 --> 01:34:10,830
There's gonna be so much goo on this.

2408
01:34:12,750 --> 01:34:13,230
There's gonna be so much goo on this.

2409
01:34:13,230 --> 01:34:15,230
I'm gonna overload this with the goo.

2410
01:34:16,470 --> 01:34:16,510
I'm gonna overload this with the goo.

2411
01:34:17,330 --> 01:34:18,470
Hey, you're doing it.

2412
01:34:18,610 --> 01:34:19,270
I'm doing it.

2413
01:34:19,710 --> 01:34:20,610
I'm doing it.

2414
01:34:20,650 --> 01:34:21,870
There's so much goo going on.

2415
01:34:22,390 --> 01:34:23,010
Don't worry.

2416
01:34:24,210 --> 01:34:25,290
Do not worry.

2417
01:34:25,430 --> 01:34:26,330
It's extra goo.

2418
01:34:27,270 --> 01:34:27,750
Okay.

2419
01:34:28,790 --> 01:34:29,270
Okay.

2420
01:34:31,590 --> 01:34:32,070
Okay.

2421
01:34:32,070 --> 01:34:34,030
Okay, now you can blow it.

2422
01:34:39,170 --> 01:34:41,050
What do I do from here?

2423
01:34:41,750 --> 01:34:42,650
Oh, I see.

2424
01:34:42,750 --> 01:34:42,850
Oh!

2425
01:34:43,290 --> 01:34:44,110
Okay, okay, okay.

2426
01:34:44,210 --> 01:34:44,690
I'm on it.

2427
01:34:49,060 --> 01:34:50,440
Why is she supposed to shoot it?

2428
01:34:51,580 --> 01:34:52,300
I don't know.

2429
01:34:52,340 --> 01:34:53,220
This is your side.

2430
01:34:53,480 --> 01:34:56,120
I was like, why would I know?

2431
01:34:56,740 --> 01:34:57,220
I'm looking.

2432
01:34:59,020 --> 01:34:59,460
Hello?

2433
01:35:01,460 --> 01:35:02,720
My gun's kind of weak.

2434
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:03,400
What the fuck?

2435
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:04,640
So weak.

2436
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:07,800
There you go.

2437
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:09,800
Look at that.

2438
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:10,380
Goo.

2439
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:13,720
Now I understand why I'm the goo.

2440
01:35:14,860 --> 01:35:16,180
What does that mean?

2441
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:21,600
Only husbands know.

2442
01:35:26,700 --> 01:35:27,260
Oh!

2443
01:35:27,380 --> 01:35:29,640
Hey, I wonder what these buttons do?

2444
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:32,100
What the hell?

2445
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:33,360
What the hell?

2446
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:36,340
Oh my god, they have a torture chamber.

2447
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:37,240
Yeah, they do.

2448
01:35:37,680 --> 01:35:38,420
What is this?

2449
01:35:42,020 --> 01:35:43,060
What happens?

2450
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:46,880
Oh shit.

2451
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:47,700
What about this?

2452
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:48,760
Oops.

2453
01:35:49,100 --> 01:35:49,760
Wrong button.

2454
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:52,660
Oh, you're an acorn!

2455
01:35:53,740 --> 01:35:56,140
How did they turn you into an acorn?

2456
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:56,780
How did they turn you into an acorn?

2457
01:35:56,780 --> 01:35:57,180
Where did you go?

2458
01:35:58,200 --> 01:35:58,880
The expected distance.

2459
01:35:59,060 --> 01:35:59,260
Close.

2460
01:36:01,620 --> 01:36:02,620
There you go.

2461
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:03,260
You're welcome.

2462
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:05,480
Wait, what?

2463
01:36:07,820 --> 01:36:08,520
Wait, what?

2464
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:09,560
Oh, I got you out.

2465
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:14,120
Dude, they have a fucking torture chamber for the wasps.

2466
01:36:14,180 --> 01:36:14,540
I know.

2467
01:36:14,640 --> 01:36:14,920
Yeah!

2468
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:17,380
Wait, you can just turn them into acorns forever.

2469
01:36:18,820 --> 01:36:19,820
So you eat them.

2470
01:36:22,460 --> 01:36:22,900
Oh.

2471
01:36:28,930 --> 01:36:29,990
Wait, do we go this way?

2472
01:36:30,230 --> 01:36:32,130
This lid doesn't look so stable.

2473
01:36:33,290 --> 01:36:35,310
Hang on, those are interesting calculations.

2474
01:36:36,190 --> 01:36:37,070
Over here!

2475
01:36:37,310 --> 01:36:37,750
Over here!

2476
01:36:38,410 --> 01:36:38,930
Corrosive.

2477
01:36:39,330 --> 01:36:40,390
Chain reaction.

2478
01:36:41,290 --> 01:36:42,010
Wait, what?

2479
01:36:42,290 --> 01:36:43,910
Do I just put this?

2480
01:36:47,740 --> 01:36:48,440
What's it do?

2481
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:49,220
Oh!

2482
01:36:49,580 --> 01:36:50,580
The latches.

2483
01:36:50,580 --> 01:36:51,000
They're opening.

2484
01:36:51,220 --> 01:36:53,180
I got it!

2485
01:36:53,300 --> 01:36:54,200
You gotta wait.

2486
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:54,600
You gotta wait.

2487
01:36:57,040 --> 01:36:58,440
I made a circle.

2488
01:36:58,720 --> 01:36:59,380
You like it?

2489
01:36:59,420 --> 01:36:59,980
It's my artwork.

2490
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:02,160
Wait, this one...

2491
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:02,600
You missed that one.

2492
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:03,600
Okay, wait.

2493
01:37:03,700 --> 01:37:05,080
Sorry, I'm not good at...

2494
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:06,520
I need more practice.

2495
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:12,580
Let me go to the bathroom real quick.

2496
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:15,720
What?

2497
01:37:15,940 --> 01:37:16,740
Oh no.

2498
01:37:17,080 --> 01:37:17,600
It's...

2499
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:19,340
Oh no, give me a sec.

2500
01:37:22,060 --> 01:37:22,580
Whoa!

2501
01:37:23,460 --> 01:37:25,060
Looks like something was kept in here.

2502
01:37:25,460 --> 01:37:25,980
Oh.

2503
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:29,580
Whatever it was, it's gone now.

2504
01:37:29,860 --> 01:37:32,480
Oh, it could be like the queen wasp.

2505
01:37:34,540 --> 01:37:35,480
What do we do for this?

2506
01:37:38,360 --> 01:37:39,640
What do we do for this?

2507
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:40,940
It's ready.

2508
01:37:41,180 --> 01:37:41,280
Oh!

2509
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:44,880
It's pulling it over.

2510
01:37:45,020 --> 01:37:45,380
Oh!

2511
01:37:45,460 --> 01:37:46,800
Okay, and then you...

2512
01:37:47,460 --> 01:37:50,280
Yeah, I was gonna say you get rid of that, and then you get rid of that.

2513
01:37:51,700 --> 01:37:52,420
And then...

2514
01:37:52,900 --> 01:37:54,000
You get rid of that.

2515
01:37:56,520 --> 01:37:57,840
Not to get rid of any of these?

2516
01:37:58,860 --> 01:38:01,000
Well, you do have to start because it weighs it down.

2517
01:38:01,300 --> 01:38:01,660
Oh!

2518
01:38:01,980 --> 01:38:02,580
See, look at that.

2519
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:04,100
It weighs the branches down and it pulls it down.

2520
01:38:04,380 --> 01:38:05,240
I see.

2521
01:38:10,620 --> 01:38:11,220
Uh oh.

2522
01:38:11,560 --> 01:38:11,820
Uh oh.

2523
01:38:12,160 --> 01:38:12,840
Uh oh.

2524
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:15,860
It's okay!

2525
01:38:16,420 --> 01:38:17,520
Oh, I'm weighing them down!

2526
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:17,800
Yeah!

2527
01:38:22,360 --> 01:38:23,240
Is that it?

2528
01:38:23,820 --> 01:38:24,860
No, there's more!

2529
01:38:25,020 --> 01:38:25,400
There's more!

2530
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:26,280
It's okay.

2531
01:38:27,080 --> 01:38:28,120
I'm quickscoping.

2532
01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:31,140
Easy.

2533
01:38:32,680 --> 01:38:34,480
Easiest fucking fight of my life.

2534
01:38:34,940 --> 01:38:35,440
Bam.

2535
01:38:38,420 --> 01:38:39,460
Look at that!

2536
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:40,140
There's nothing!

2537
01:38:40,940 --> 01:38:41,400
Yeah!

2538
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:47,260
Okay, simmer down, Simon.

2539
01:38:47,900 --> 01:38:48,840
Yeah, Simon.

2540
01:38:49,500 --> 01:38:51,300
It's not the weapon.

2541
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:53,000
It's how we use it.

2542
01:38:54,780 --> 01:38:55,940
How do we do this?

2543
01:38:56,940 --> 01:38:58,640
There's some acorns over here.

2544
01:39:00,740 --> 01:39:02,520
Do those acorns matter?

2545
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:04,220
Oh, I know!

2546
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:04,640
I know!

2547
01:39:04,700 --> 01:39:05,060
I know!

2548
01:39:06,080 --> 01:39:06,860
We light it!

2549
01:39:07,540 --> 01:39:07,900
Yeah!

2550
01:39:09,060 --> 01:39:10,240
Yeah, and then you blow it up.

2551
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:12,060
I think you go up there.

2552
01:39:12,100 --> 01:39:12,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2553
01:39:12,980 --> 01:39:14,740
And then...

2554
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:15,960
Oh!

2555
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:16,920
Oh!

2556
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:17,580
I get it!

2557
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:17,960
I got it!

2558
01:39:17,980 --> 01:39:18,420
I got it!

2559
01:39:18,420 --> 01:39:18,740
I got it!

2560
01:39:18,760 --> 01:39:19,540
I got it!

2561
01:39:19,640 --> 01:39:22,140
You have to blow this and the other one.

2562
01:39:23,540 --> 01:39:24,220
Give me a sec.

2563
01:39:24,260 --> 01:39:25,540
I'll let you know when to blow it up.

2564
01:39:26,260 --> 01:39:27,800
Look, we're working together, Gumi!

2565
01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:30,260
Maybe this marriage is salvageable!

2566
01:39:31,480 --> 01:39:33,740
Okay, you blow this up.

2567
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:34,440
And then...

2568
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:35,440
Blow this up first.

2569
01:39:35,480 --> 01:39:36,000
The first one.

2570
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:39,260
And then the second one.

2571
01:39:40,180 --> 01:39:41,220
And then...

2572
01:39:42,020 --> 01:39:43,560
I leave you for another woman.

2573
01:39:43,580 --> 01:39:44,740
And then I guess I just go fuck myself.

2574
01:39:45,140 --> 01:39:45,500
Yeah.

2575
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:49,160
I think there's a bridge here!

2576
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:50,520
Let's knock it down then!

2577
01:39:50,780 --> 01:39:51,420
There is?

2578
01:39:54,060 --> 01:39:54,580
Ow.

2579
01:39:58,350 --> 01:39:58,870
Ow.

2580
01:40:00,210 --> 01:40:00,730
Here?

2581
01:40:03,390 --> 01:40:03,790
Oh!

2582
01:40:03,810 --> 01:40:04,550
Okay, okay, okay!

2583
01:40:04,550 --> 01:40:05,130
I figured it out!

2584
01:40:08,650 --> 01:40:09,050
Go!

2585
01:40:09,050 --> 01:40:09,610
Throw it!

2586
01:40:09,610 --> 01:40:09,810
Blow it!

2587
01:40:09,890 --> 01:40:10,090
Yeah!

2588
01:40:11,250 --> 01:40:12,190
I did it!

2589
01:40:12,330 --> 01:40:12,670
See?

2590
01:40:12,830 --> 01:40:14,550
I'll never leave you!

2591
01:40:14,830 --> 01:40:14,910
There we go!

2592
01:40:15,010 --> 01:40:16,730
I told you I'll never leave you!

2593
01:40:16,830 --> 01:40:16,990
What?

2594
01:40:17,070 --> 01:40:17,830
I thought we were getting divorced.

2595
01:40:18,170 --> 01:40:19,770
You're literally leaving through divorce.

2596
01:40:19,970 --> 01:40:22,350
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2597
01:40:22,510 --> 01:40:23,290
Oh, you have to shoot that.

2598
01:40:23,730 --> 01:40:24,610
You shoot through that?

2599
01:40:27,150 --> 01:40:27,550
Yeah.

2600
01:40:28,310 --> 01:40:28,710
Yeah.

2601
01:40:28,910 --> 01:40:30,470
Look, you asked for the divorce!

2602
01:40:32,110 --> 01:40:32,950
No, you did!

2603
01:40:33,150 --> 01:40:34,490
No, you asked for it!

2604
01:40:34,830 --> 01:40:36,130
I disagreed!

2605
01:40:37,690 --> 01:40:39,290
What the fuck just happened to me?

2606
01:40:39,650 --> 01:40:40,750
I came like, live.

2607
01:40:40,970 --> 01:40:41,690
Yeah, you lied.

2608
01:40:41,710 --> 01:40:42,470
I saw that.

2609
01:40:43,110 --> 01:40:43,870
What the fuck?

2610
01:40:45,530 --> 01:40:46,230
Wait, what's this?

2611
01:40:46,330 --> 01:40:47,050
Oh, it's a tug of war!

2612
01:40:48,330 --> 01:40:50,110
I got the fastest fingers in the West.

2613
01:40:50,810 --> 01:40:51,230
Oh.

2614
01:40:51,390 --> 01:40:52,350
I'm on the right side.

2615
01:40:52,410 --> 01:40:52,770
I'm green.

2616
01:40:58,090 --> 01:40:59,170
Alright, I'm ready.

2617
01:40:59,170 --> 01:41:01,370
Alright, I'm looking forward to this.

2618
01:41:01,750 --> 01:41:02,530
I'm ready.

2619
01:41:06,300 --> 01:41:07,800
I played Mario Party.

2620
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:09,640
What the fuck?

2621
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:12,960
What?

2622
01:41:24,220 --> 01:41:26,220
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2623
01:41:26,360 --> 01:41:27,860
This'll be a piece of cake.

2624
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:30,480
Back to Mario Party.

2625
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:31,700
Back to Mario Party.

2626
01:41:31,980 --> 01:41:34,100
Like, my fingers are tired today.

2627
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:35,040
What?

2628
01:41:36,260 --> 01:41:38,600
How are you so good at this?

2629
01:41:41,310 --> 01:41:43,010
Yeah, I played Mario Party.

2630
01:41:43,210 --> 01:41:45,350
You better than that!

2631
01:41:46,150 --> 01:41:47,070
You wanna go?

2632
01:41:47,190 --> 01:41:48,410
No, that's okay.

2633
01:41:50,010 --> 01:41:52,310
You just really go with your fingers apparently.

2634
01:41:53,810 --> 01:41:55,550
You just really go with your fingers apparently.

2635
01:41:55,550 --> 01:41:56,050
Yeah.

2636
01:41:56,050 --> 01:41:57,990
Yeah, sorry about that.

2637
01:41:58,290 --> 01:42:00,270
Yeah, sorry about that.

2638
01:42:00,270 --> 01:42:02,290
Rose and I used to play with it all the time.

2639
01:42:02,450 --> 01:42:04,430
Just another thing this spring.

2640
01:42:04,670 --> 01:42:07,390
That was a great time.

2641
01:42:07,910 --> 01:42:09,070
Oh, man.

2642
01:42:09,730 --> 01:42:10,950
My legs hurt.

2643
01:42:12,670 --> 01:42:14,010
Dude, what the fuck?

2644
01:42:14,130 --> 01:42:15,870
Why can't they make this a cutscene or anything?

2645
01:42:16,330 --> 01:42:17,130
I know!

2646
01:42:17,290 --> 01:42:18,350
Why do we have to do this?

2647
01:42:18,430 --> 01:42:20,210
They're like, look at how beautiful this is.

2648
01:42:20,370 --> 01:42:21,630
Yeah, just give us the cutscene.

2649
01:42:22,610 --> 01:42:23,670
You don't know that!

2650
01:42:24,210 --> 01:42:27,100
We'll get to it!

2651
01:42:27,300 --> 01:42:28,680
What the fuck do we...

2652
01:42:28,680 --> 01:42:31,500
Oh my god, I'm getting like...

2653
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:34,960
I'm getting on to all the ops.

2654
01:42:35,060 --> 01:42:36,700
How did I not hit that?

2655
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:39,620
Oh, here you go.

2656
01:42:41,380 --> 01:42:41,940
It's okay.

2657
01:42:42,020 --> 01:42:42,760
I'm coming back.

2658
01:42:45,140 --> 01:42:45,900
Don't worry.

2659
01:42:46,640 --> 01:42:47,440
I'm here.

2660
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:49,820
If you were worried, I'm here.

2661
01:42:50,740 --> 01:42:51,480
Oh, what?

2662
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:53,060
You weren't hit the entire time?

2663
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:53,660
I'm here.

2664
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:54,320
Don't worry.

2665
01:42:56,220 --> 01:42:57,880
You don't have to worry.

2666
01:42:58,380 --> 01:42:59,580
Gumi, I'm here.

2667
01:42:59,620 --> 01:42:59,860
Gumi.

2668
01:43:01,780 --> 01:43:02,460
Don't worry.

2669
01:43:03,240 --> 01:43:03,760
Huh?

2670
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:07,580
I'm like right behind you.

2671
01:43:09,400 --> 01:43:10,160
Say something.

2672
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:10,360
What?

2673
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:12,660
Oh, someone died.

2674
01:43:13,160 --> 01:43:14,740
Okay, that's bullshit!

2675
01:43:14,860 --> 01:43:16,660
You fucking activated it!

2676
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:18,420
Where am I?

2677
01:43:18,660 --> 01:43:19,920
Oh my god.

2678
01:43:19,980 --> 01:43:20,320
I'm getting lost.

2679
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:21,520
I didn't activate shit!

2680
01:43:21,860 --> 01:43:24,040
I'm getting lost because of you.

2681
01:43:27,940 --> 01:43:29,440
Oh my god.

2682
01:43:31,300 --> 01:43:32,580
Okay, we're fine.

2683
01:43:33,060 --> 01:43:33,920
We're fine.

2684
01:43:34,860 --> 01:43:39,360
Maybe I should just keep dying because apparently when I die, I just respond to wherever you are.

2685
01:43:40,340 --> 01:43:40,780
Like...

2686
01:43:46,340 --> 01:43:48,140
This has to be a boss fight.

2687
01:43:49,460 --> 01:43:51,320
Nah, this is gonna be a mini fight.

2688
01:43:52,620 --> 01:43:53,980
Too early for the boss fight.

2689
01:43:53,980 --> 01:43:54,360
That's true.

2690
01:43:54,380 --> 01:43:54,780
That's true.

2691
01:43:54,820 --> 01:43:55,720
It looks like a mini fight.

2692
01:43:59,880 --> 01:44:02,140
May the acorn be with you, they said.

2693
01:44:02,360 --> 01:44:03,300
Alright, let's see.

2694
01:44:04,100 --> 01:44:04,540
Oh!

2695
01:44:04,920 --> 01:44:06,460
We just turn it.

2696
01:44:07,780 --> 01:44:08,220
Yeah.

2697
01:44:12,020 --> 01:44:13,020
There's nothing wrong with that.

2698
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:13,540
We just turn.

2699
01:44:15,340 --> 01:44:15,700
Oh!

2700
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:16,320
Oh!

2701
01:44:16,420 --> 01:44:18,680
And then the wasps come in while we turn.

2702
01:44:20,620 --> 01:44:21,340
Um... Okay.

2703
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:24,420
They're all down.

2704
01:44:24,700 --> 01:44:25,320
It's up to you.

2705
01:44:25,420 --> 01:44:25,760
They're all down.

2706
01:44:29,260 --> 01:44:29,900
Is there anymore?

2707
01:44:31,180 --> 01:44:31,720
They're down.

2708
01:44:31,780 --> 01:44:32,040
They're down.

2709
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:37,040
Keep turning!

2710
01:44:37,180 --> 01:44:37,760
I'm still turning!

2711
01:44:42,640 --> 01:44:43,000
Oh!

2712
01:44:43,420 --> 01:44:43,780
Shield!

2713
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:44,320
Oh!

2714
01:44:44,420 --> 01:44:45,720
Shield wasps!

2715
01:44:45,720 --> 01:44:47,560
This one looks tougher than the others.

2716
01:44:48,040 --> 01:44:48,960
Oh, this is...

2717
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:51,040
My sap isn't sticking to its shield!

2718
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:52,280
Yeah, my sap isn't sticking!

2719
01:44:52,860 --> 01:44:52,880
Shoot at his butt!

2720
01:44:52,920 --> 01:44:53,800
Shoot at his butt!

2721
01:44:54,940 --> 01:44:55,380
How?!

2722
01:44:55,380 --> 01:44:56,740
I'm fucking... Oh, okay.

2723
01:44:56,780 --> 01:44:57,360
I'm shooting the butt.

2724
01:44:57,400 --> 01:44:57,980
I'm shooting the ass.

2725
01:44:58,320 --> 01:44:59,480
I'm shooting the ass!

2726
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:02,140
Shoot it!

2727
01:45:02,240 --> 01:45:02,660
Shoot it!

2728
01:45:02,660 --> 01:45:03,000
Shoot it!

2729
01:45:03,020 --> 01:45:03,940
The ass has been stuck!

2730
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:06,160
He's aiming at me!

2731
01:45:06,440 --> 01:45:07,020
It's okay!

2732
01:45:07,120 --> 01:45:07,620
I'm pulling!

2733
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:10,600
Shoot the ass!

2734
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:12,800
There, see?

2735
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:14,240
That wasn't so hard.

2736
01:45:15,340 --> 01:45:15,740
Okay.

2737
01:45:17,240 --> 01:45:18,300
Okay, shoot the ass!

2738
01:45:18,300 --> 01:45:19,060
Shoot the ass!

2739
01:45:19,300 --> 01:45:19,540
Oh!

2740
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:21,120
I got shot in the ass!

2741
01:45:21,540 --> 01:45:21,760
I did!

2742
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:22,660
His ass is stuck!

2743
01:45:24,200 --> 01:45:25,360
His ass is gone!

2744
01:45:25,720 --> 01:45:25,780
His ass is gone!

2745
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:28,940
Okay, I need you to shoot that!

2746
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:30,280
I need you to shoot this goop!

2747
01:45:33,080 --> 01:45:35,680
Okay, while you do this, I'm gonna shoot the goop here.

2748
01:45:36,480 --> 01:45:37,100
I need you to shoot this goop!

2749
01:45:37,100 --> 01:45:37,400
Oh, shit!

2750
01:45:37,480 --> 01:45:38,140
Oh, shit!

2751
01:45:38,180 --> 01:45:38,400
Okay.

2752
01:45:39,420 --> 01:45:39,940
Got it!

2753
01:45:40,180 --> 01:45:40,580
I'm shooting the goop!

2754
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:40,900
Dodged!

2755
01:45:41,420 --> 01:45:41,900
Dodged!

2756
01:45:42,980 --> 01:45:43,780
Ash is shot!

2757
01:45:43,860 --> 01:45:44,360
Ash is shot!

2758
01:45:45,160 --> 01:45:45,780
One more!

2759
01:45:45,880 --> 01:45:46,120
One more!

2760
01:45:47,700 --> 01:45:48,180
Nice!

2761
01:45:48,220 --> 01:45:48,720
He's distracted!

2762
01:45:52,540 --> 01:45:53,220
He's good!

2763
01:45:53,320 --> 01:45:53,780
He's good!

2764
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:54,200
He's good!

2765
01:45:54,660 --> 01:45:55,320
We did it!

2766
01:45:55,320 --> 01:45:55,660
We got him!

2767
01:45:56,040 --> 01:45:56,480
Nice!

2768
01:45:58,240 --> 01:45:58,720
Easy!

2769
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:03,340
So easy!

2770
01:46:04,120 --> 01:46:04,920
Easy clap!

2771
01:46:06,280 --> 01:46:07,880
We're so good at Ash shots!

2772
01:46:09,340 --> 01:46:09,820
Backshot!

2773
01:46:09,860 --> 01:46:10,280
Backshot!

2774
01:46:19,060 --> 01:46:31,160
We did it!

2775
01:46:35,080 --> 01:46:36,700
No care!

2776
01:46:37,060 --> 01:46:37,200
No need to envisioned.

2777
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:39,940
I'm right!

2778
01:46:39,940 --> 01:46:40,580
You want me to shoot this goop now?

2779
01:46:40,580 --> 01:46:47,700
I thought wasps... for the ants, I know when the ant queen needs babies, they start birthing male soldiers.

2780
01:46:48,160 --> 01:46:51,720
And then the moment the queen ant is pregnant, they kick them out.

2781
01:46:53,300 --> 01:46:54,860
I thought those were bees.

2782
01:46:56,240 --> 01:46:57,980
No, it's for ants too.

2783
01:46:58,420 --> 01:46:59,620
Isn't our wasps...

2784
01:47:00,370 --> 01:47:02,720
Oh, some wasps have male drones?

2785
01:47:02,720 --> 01:47:03,020
Drones?

2786
01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:09,760
I thought all bugs were like that.

2787
01:47:09,800 --> 01:47:11,460
Like all colony bugs are like that.

2788
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:15,620
What the bug?

2789
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:18,500
Yeah, someone's like they mate with a drone and then the drone dies.

2790
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:20,040
That's their purpose.

2791
01:47:20,420 --> 01:47:20,880
Yeah.

2792
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:22,780
They were... because like every...

2793
01:47:22,780 --> 01:47:23,320
As they should.

2794
01:47:27,460 --> 01:47:27,980
Whoa.

2795
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:33,960
I didn't know... yeah, porn to love.

2796
01:47:34,180 --> 01:47:35,580
Porn to love not to work.

2797
01:47:38,780 --> 01:47:39,680
Okay, then...

2798
01:47:39,680 --> 01:47:41,960
Listen, the bees are onto something, dude.

2799
01:47:42,100 --> 01:47:44,400
Like why would they eat the food they mate?

2800
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:44,640
Porn to love not to work.

2801
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:45,660
Holy shit.

2802
01:47:46,180 --> 01:47:48,500
Someone's like I'm fine with that.

2803
01:47:49,100 --> 01:47:50,480
It's like Snoo Snoo.

2804
01:47:50,660 --> 01:47:52,460
Like that Futurama episode.

2805
01:47:54,120 --> 01:47:55,940
Death by Snoo Snoo.

2806
01:47:56,940 --> 01:47:57,420
Uh oh.

2807
01:47:57,540 --> 01:47:58,660
Death by Snoo Snoo.

2808
01:47:59,780 --> 01:48:01,300
Ew, kill the babies!

2809
01:48:01,460 --> 01:48:02,180
Kill the babies!

2810
01:48:06,520 --> 01:48:10,420
Bro, why don't we just like shoot the... shoot the big... the honeycomb.

2811
01:48:10,840 --> 01:48:11,360
Ow!

2812
01:48:11,620 --> 01:48:12,440
You shot me!

2813
01:48:13,160 --> 01:48:15,580
Shoot the baby in birthing area!

2814
01:48:17,580 --> 01:48:18,300
I did.

2815
01:48:18,780 --> 01:48:20,360
There you go, the baby birthing area.

2816
01:48:20,460 --> 01:48:20,540
There's more!

2817
01:48:20,540 --> 01:48:21,120
There's more!

2818
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:21,920
There's more crawling!

2819
01:48:21,940 --> 01:48:22,440
There's more?

2820
01:48:22,720 --> 01:48:23,280
Oh shit.

2821
01:48:23,380 --> 01:48:24,820
I was trying to look at the cookbook.

2822
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:28,300
Stop shooting me!

2823
01:48:28,760 --> 01:48:30,200
Stop getting so close!

2824
01:48:31,240 --> 01:48:32,180
Stop getting so close!

2825
01:48:32,180 --> 01:48:32,300
Stop getting so close!

2826
01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:35,680
Stop!

2827
01:48:37,640 --> 01:48:40,080
I was trying to run past them!

2828
01:48:42,180 --> 01:48:42,500
Alright.

2829
01:48:42,920 --> 01:48:43,560
Alright.

2830
01:48:43,780 --> 01:48:46,720
Clearly I have to fucking back out after.

2831
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:48,020
Alright, here I am.

2832
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:50,760
I shot... I did the honeycomb.

2833
01:48:50,820 --> 01:48:51,740
I did the honeycomb.

2834
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:53,220
Oh shit!

2835
01:48:53,480 --> 01:48:54,820
Okay, I did the honeycomb again.

2836
01:48:55,120 --> 01:48:56,260
The honeycomb...

2837
01:48:56,260 --> 01:48:57,180
There's a baby on me!

2838
01:48:57,620 --> 01:48:58,720
Shoot the baby!

2839
01:48:59,360 --> 01:49:01,440
I can't hear you goofed up!

2840
01:49:01,880 --> 01:49:02,500
I did!

2841
01:49:02,660 --> 01:49:04,160
I goofed all over the baby!

2842
01:49:04,180 --> 01:49:05,860
Okay, I shouldn't say that out loud.

2843
01:49:09,560 --> 01:49:10,860
It's like, dumb.

2844
01:49:13,140 --> 01:49:14,280
Oh god.

2845
01:49:15,400 --> 01:49:17,080
Oh my god!

2846
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:19,280
There's so many!

2847
01:49:23,960 --> 01:49:25,080
Alright, there you go.

2848
01:49:25,340 --> 01:49:26,780
The babies are goofed.

2849
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:28,200
What?

2850
01:49:30,040 --> 01:49:31,100
Not by me.

2851
01:49:32,220 --> 01:49:32,820
I did it.

2852
01:49:33,660 --> 01:49:34,160
I did it.

2853
01:49:34,160 --> 01:49:34,900
I need to clarify.

2854
01:49:35,500 --> 01:49:36,120
Apparently.

2855
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:38,720
There's so many goofed babies!

2856
01:49:39,100 --> 01:49:40,500
That wasn't done by me!

2857
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:43,900
Oh god.

2858
01:49:44,060 --> 01:49:44,320
Okay.

2859
01:49:44,580 --> 01:49:45,500
Oh god!

2860
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:48,080
I have the hardest job here.

2861
01:49:49,720 --> 01:49:52,780
I have the hardest job here, man.

2862
01:49:59,780 --> 01:50:00,400
Oh.

2863
01:50:01,340 --> 01:50:02,500
Hey, you got it!

2864
01:50:02,500 --> 01:50:03,380
I did it.

2865
01:50:04,440 --> 01:50:05,660
I did it.

2866
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:06,480
Yay!

2867
01:50:09,780 --> 01:50:10,860
What do we do here?

2868
01:50:11,080 --> 01:50:11,260
Hey, what's this?

2869
01:50:12,680 --> 01:50:14,020
What puzzle is this?

2870
01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:17,320
Okay, I clearly can't do anything about it.

2871
01:50:20,380 --> 01:50:20,940
Uhhhh...

2872
01:50:20,940 --> 01:50:22,600
Oh wait, there's a wall here!

2873
01:50:24,840 --> 01:50:25,400
Nope.

2874
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:26,700
Never mind.

2875
01:50:27,780 --> 01:50:28,960
Oh, there's a bottle?

2876
01:50:29,540 --> 01:50:30,340
And a hole?

2877
01:50:30,540 --> 01:50:31,220
I think we have to...

2878
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:33,540
Drop the bottle into a hole?

2879
01:50:35,680 --> 01:50:37,500
Yeah, make sure we drop the bottle into the hole.

2880
01:50:37,620 --> 01:50:38,860
No, no, there's like...

2881
01:50:38,860 --> 01:50:39,860
grass on it.

2882
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:40,320
On the side.

2883
01:50:40,680 --> 01:50:41,300
There is?

2884
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:41,900
Oh, there is!

2885
01:50:44,500 --> 01:50:44,900
Okay.

2886
01:50:44,940 --> 01:50:45,940
I'm on the opposite side.

2887
01:50:46,020 --> 01:50:46,660
Let me walk over.

2888
01:50:47,780 --> 01:50:48,600
I did it.

2889
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:51,980
Oh, I see!

2890
01:50:52,580 --> 01:50:53,720
Okay, I'll goof the other one.

2891
01:50:54,780 --> 01:50:56,100
Oh, the bees are happy.

2892
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:57,160
Bees not happy.

2893
01:50:58,960 --> 01:50:59,300
Bees are easy.

2894
01:50:59,940 --> 01:51:01,160
They're not the...

2895
01:51:02,600 --> 01:51:04,380
Oh wait, there's bees on you.

2896
01:51:05,160 --> 01:51:06,300
There's bees on you.

2897
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:07,760
Oh, there's two bees on us!

2898
01:51:08,100 --> 01:51:09,120
Oh, that's a boss!

2899
01:51:11,940 --> 01:51:12,740
That's a boss.

2900
01:51:14,180 --> 01:51:15,240
I got the other...

2901
01:51:15,240 --> 01:51:15,880
I got the small ones!

2902
01:51:17,140 --> 01:51:18,700
The boss is on me!

2903
01:51:19,060 --> 01:51:20,560
I got the small ones though!

2904
01:51:20,720 --> 01:51:21,600
I goofed it!

2905
01:51:22,840 --> 01:51:24,480
There's so much goof on it!

2906
01:51:24,520 --> 01:51:25,140
I kept goofing!

2907
01:51:26,600 --> 01:51:28,380
I'm getting fucking poisoned!

2908
01:51:29,260 --> 01:51:30,180
Just keep shooting!

2909
01:51:33,320 --> 01:51:33,960
I'm dodging!

2910
01:51:34,680 --> 01:51:35,120
I'm dodging!

2911
01:51:36,540 --> 01:51:37,500
I shot him again!

2912
01:51:37,780 --> 01:51:38,000
I shot him again!

2913
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:38,320
Keep shooting!

2914
01:51:39,680 --> 01:51:40,240
Never stop!

2915
01:51:42,460 --> 01:51:43,220
Where did he go?

2916
01:51:43,340 --> 01:51:43,940
Oh shit!

2917
01:51:44,140 --> 01:51:45,620
Bro, she's so goofed up.

2918
01:51:47,420 --> 01:51:48,060
Oh shit!

2919
01:51:48,060 --> 01:51:48,060
Bro, she's so goofed up!

2920
01:51:48,060 --> 01:51:48,660
Alright, I'm okay.

2921
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:49,000
I'm okay.

2922
01:51:49,740 --> 01:51:50,980
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot!

2923
01:51:51,360 --> 01:51:52,280
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot!

2924
01:51:52,380 --> 01:51:53,120
Oh fuck!

2925
01:51:53,240 --> 01:51:53,560
Okay.

2926
01:51:54,660 --> 01:51:55,320
Okay, I'm dead.

2927
01:51:55,380 --> 01:51:55,600
I'm dead.

2928
01:51:55,640 --> 01:51:55,980
Don't die.

2929
01:51:56,040 --> 01:51:56,360
Don't die.

2930
01:51:56,400 --> 01:51:56,680
I'm dead.

2931
01:51:56,680 --> 01:51:57,020
I'm dead.

2932
01:51:57,080 --> 01:51:57,160
I'm dead.

2933
01:51:57,160 --> 01:51:57,340
I'm dead.

2934
01:51:58,120 --> 01:51:58,660
There you go.

2935
01:52:00,040 --> 01:52:00,500
Shoot her!

2936
01:52:00,700 --> 01:52:00,920
Shoot her!

2937
01:52:00,980 --> 01:52:01,120
Shoot her!

2938
01:52:03,020 --> 01:52:03,460
Shoot her!

2939
01:52:03,720 --> 01:52:03,940
Shoot her!

2940
01:52:03,980 --> 01:52:04,180
Shoot her!

2941
01:52:04,280 --> 01:52:04,760
She's full!

2942
01:52:04,860 --> 01:52:05,140
She's full!

2943
01:52:05,200 --> 01:52:05,500
She's full!

2944
01:52:05,540 --> 01:52:07,380
How the fuck do you flick with the controller?

2945
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:08,220
She's full!

2946
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:08,700
She's full!

2947
01:52:08,720 --> 01:52:09,260
She's full again!

2948
01:52:09,440 --> 01:52:09,980
She's full again!

2949
01:52:15,220 --> 01:52:15,540
EDF!

2950
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:16,800
EDF!

2951
01:52:18,520 --> 01:52:20,320
We have EDF at home, guys.

2952
01:52:20,780 --> 01:52:21,420
We have...

2953
01:52:22,760 --> 01:52:23,700
This is Helldivers.

2954
01:52:27,940 --> 01:52:29,980
Oh, I have to put this on here.

2955
01:52:31,660 --> 01:52:32,700
Oh, I have to put this on here.

2956
01:52:33,580 --> 01:52:34,100
Nice.

2957
01:52:34,440 --> 01:52:36,260
Alright, and then we gotta jump here.

2958
01:52:36,500 --> 01:52:36,840
Alright, and then we gotta jump here.

2959
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:38,300
Because I made this for us.

2960
01:52:40,060 --> 01:52:40,580
Okay.

2961
01:52:41,240 --> 01:52:41,760
Yeah!

2962
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:43,740
Happy anniversary!

2963
01:52:44,340 --> 01:52:45,480
This is my gift.

2964
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:46,580
Oh!

2965
01:52:47,860 --> 01:52:48,380
Oh!

2966
01:52:50,440 --> 01:52:51,040
Bindi picture!

2967
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:52,760
Oh my god.

2968
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:54,280
Nice.

2969
01:52:55,160 --> 01:52:56,560
Can you like get closer?

2970
01:52:56,680 --> 01:52:57,260
To the camera?

2971
01:52:58,420 --> 01:52:58,920
Can you...

2972
01:52:59,800 --> 01:53:01,640
What do you mean can I get closer to the camera?

2973
01:53:02,180 --> 01:53:03,560
Can you get closer to the camera?

2974
01:53:03,700 --> 01:53:03,980
Okay.

2975
01:53:04,060 --> 01:53:06,040
And then... No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2976
01:53:06,160 --> 01:53:06,600
Get closer.

2977
01:53:07,580 --> 01:53:09,180
Can you turn around?

2978
01:53:10,760 --> 01:53:11,480
Yeah, that's good.

2979
01:53:12,240 --> 01:53:13,360
Okay, can you move up a little bit?

2980
01:53:14,640 --> 01:53:15,000
Okay.

2981
01:53:19,060 --> 01:53:19,620
Okay, okay.

2982
01:53:19,720 --> 01:53:21,280
Move a little bit more left to left.

2983
01:53:21,740 --> 01:53:22,480
Let me see...

2984
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:25,180
Back up, back up.

2985
01:53:27,700 --> 01:53:28,500
Oh, yeah.

2986
01:53:29,520 --> 01:53:30,120
Nice.

2987
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:31,820
Okay, there you go.

2988
01:53:31,960 --> 01:53:32,920
That's all I wanted.

2989
01:53:34,540 --> 01:53:37,440
Oh, look!

2990
01:53:37,620 --> 01:53:38,900
They're fighting it!

2991
01:53:39,480 --> 01:53:40,580
It's like a...

2992
01:53:40,580 --> 01:53:43,020
It's like a history lesson.

2993
01:53:44,160 --> 01:53:45,680
Oh, there's a timer!

2994
01:53:46,900 --> 01:53:48,160
Oh, there's a timer!

2995
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:50,840
Oh, there's a timer!

2996
01:53:51,060 --> 01:53:51,580
Is that us?

2997
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:53,940
Look at us.

2998
01:53:55,400 --> 01:53:56,180
That's us!

2999
01:53:56,980 --> 01:53:58,120
Oh, wait!

3000
01:53:58,240 --> 01:53:58,700
Is this...

3001
01:53:58,720 --> 01:53:59,180
Is this a puzzle?

3002
01:54:00,140 --> 01:54:02,100
No, I think this is just for fun, man.

3003
01:54:02,220 --> 01:54:02,700
Oh, okay.

3004
01:54:03,220 --> 01:54:04,080
Oh my god!

3005
01:54:04,120 --> 01:54:05,500
This is our best photo yet!

3006
01:54:07,120 --> 01:54:07,940
Wait, let me see.

3007
01:54:10,180 --> 01:54:11,160
What the fuck?

3008
01:54:12,500 --> 01:54:18,140
What the hell?

3009
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:19,260
I know, I know.

3010
01:54:19,780 --> 01:54:21,180
I'm a great photographer.

3011
01:54:21,540 --> 01:54:23,480
I think we gotta go.

3012
01:54:24,080 --> 01:54:25,400
What about my photo?

3013
01:54:26,920 --> 01:54:28,380
What about my photo?

3014
01:54:28,820 --> 01:54:29,340
What about my photo?

3015
01:54:29,340 --> 01:54:29,920
Okay, okay.

3016
01:54:30,180 --> 01:54:31,160
Let me go.

3017
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:33,060
How do you want me to pose?

3018
01:54:34,740 --> 01:54:35,920
How do you want me to pose?

3019
01:54:41,890 --> 01:54:42,690
It's beautiful.

3020
01:54:44,310 --> 01:54:45,450
What the hell?

3021
01:54:45,950 --> 01:54:46,370
What the hell?

3022
01:54:46,910 --> 01:54:47,770
Look at this.

3023
01:54:47,990 --> 01:54:48,790
Look at that.

3024
01:54:49,070 --> 01:54:49,950
That's pretty good.

3025
01:54:50,350 --> 01:54:51,530
I know, it is.

3026
01:54:51,850 --> 01:54:54,590
That's a really good photo.

3027
01:54:58,090 --> 01:55:00,170
Oh, these are like all the photos she must have...

3028
01:55:00,170 --> 01:55:02,310
Wait, who took these photos?

3029
01:55:03,090 --> 01:55:03,670
Wait a minute.

3030
01:55:04,130 --> 01:55:05,290
The squirrels did, man.

3031
01:55:06,070 --> 01:55:08,190
Hey, this looks like a boss battle area.

3032
01:55:08,470 --> 01:55:09,710
Oh, that definitely looks like...

3033
01:55:09,710 --> 01:55:10,410
Yeah, it's time to go down.

3034
01:55:11,570 --> 01:55:13,690
There's a lot of creep shots of us, though.

3035
01:55:14,410 --> 01:55:14,850
Ducky?

3036
01:55:15,450 --> 01:55:15,890
Yeah?

3037
01:55:17,210 --> 01:55:17,650
Oh.

3038
01:55:20,790 --> 01:55:22,110
Oh my god!

3039
01:55:22,170 --> 01:55:23,290
Oh, it is a hammer!

3040
01:55:25,330 --> 01:55:26,210
Oh, god.

3041
01:55:26,210 --> 01:55:26,410
Oh, god.

3042
01:55:26,510 --> 01:55:28,210
Oh, god.

3043
01:55:28,210 --> 01:55:28,210
Oh,

3044
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:40,140
god.

3045
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:41,340
Where's the HP?

3046
01:55:42,760 --> 01:55:43,140
Okay.

3047
01:55:46,040 --> 01:55:46,760
Oh, god.

3048
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:47,380
There's so many.

3049
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:48,860
Okay.

3050
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:50,880
They're full of honey.

3051
01:55:51,780 --> 01:55:55,160
Oh, god.

3052
01:55:55,240 --> 01:55:55,840
They're full of honey.

3053
01:56:01,260 --> 01:56:01,640
I'm dead!

3054
01:56:01,780 --> 01:56:01,940
I'm dead!

3055
01:56:04,220 --> 01:56:04,640
I'm okay.

3056
01:56:04,740 --> 01:56:05,040
I'm okay.

3057
01:56:05,080 --> 01:56:05,680
You can die now.

3058
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:08,440
But not really.

3059
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:08,840
Not really.

3060
01:56:08,940 --> 01:56:09,240
Not really.

3061
01:56:11,440 --> 01:56:12,040
Oh, god.

3062
01:56:13,360 --> 01:56:13,760
Oh, god.

3063
01:56:13,760 --> 01:56:14,040
It's fine.

3064
01:56:14,140 --> 01:56:14,380
It's fine.

3065
01:56:14,440 --> 01:56:14,700
It's fine.

3066
01:56:14,740 --> 01:56:14,980
It's fine.

3067
01:56:16,160 --> 01:56:16,720
We're good.

3068
01:56:17,580 --> 01:56:18,180
We're good.

3069
01:56:18,300 --> 01:56:18,420
Ah!

3070
01:56:18,540 --> 01:56:18,820
Whoa!

3071
01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:20,140
There's so many bees!

3072
01:56:21,580 --> 01:56:22,380
There's more!

3073
01:56:22,820 --> 01:56:23,980
How is there more?

3074
01:56:26,680 --> 01:56:27,280
Oh, god.

3075
01:56:28,460 --> 01:56:29,880
Are we supposed to like...

3076
01:56:29,880 --> 01:56:31,320
Are we supposed to like...

3077
01:56:31,320 --> 01:56:31,320
Wait.

3078
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:32,180
Wait.

3079
01:56:32,240 --> 01:56:32,980
Wait a minute.

3080
01:56:33,960 --> 01:56:34,900
I don't think so.

3081
01:56:34,980 --> 01:56:35,540
I don't think so.

3082
01:56:35,640 --> 01:56:36,140
I don't think so.

3083
01:56:36,140 --> 01:56:37,000
I don't think so.

3084
01:56:37,200 --> 01:56:37,700
I think we were.

3085
01:56:37,700 --> 01:56:38,680
We were supposed to.

3086
01:56:41,060 --> 01:56:42,020
I don't think so.

3087
01:56:42,160 --> 01:56:42,300
I don't think so.

3088
01:56:42,300 --> 01:56:42,300
Oh.

3089
01:56:42,420 --> 01:56:42,760
Okay.

3090
01:56:45,380 --> 01:56:46,420
Donkey, go for it!

3091
01:56:46,460 --> 01:56:46,900
Go for it!

3092
01:56:52,250 --> 01:56:53,090
Donkey, go for it!

3093
01:56:53,090 --> 01:56:53,090
Go for it!

3094
01:56:53,090 --> 01:56:53,150
Okay.

3095
01:56:53,430 --> 01:56:53,790
Nice.

3096
01:56:57,450 --> 01:56:58,990
Look, I don't want to get dehydrated.

3097
01:56:59,250 --> 01:56:59,510
Look, I don't want to get dehydrated.

3098
01:57:00,930 --> 01:57:01,290
Okay.

3099
01:57:01,350 --> 01:57:02,070
I got the first box.

3100
01:57:02,130 --> 01:57:02,330
Okay.

3101
01:57:02,350 --> 01:57:02,530
There.

3102
01:57:02,650 --> 01:57:02,770
Okay.

3103
01:57:02,770 --> 01:57:02,770
I got the first box.

3104
01:57:02,770 --> 01:57:02,770
Okay.

3105
01:57:02,770 --> 01:57:02,770
There.

3106
01:57:03,330 --> 01:57:03,690
Alright.

3107
01:57:07,130 --> 01:57:07,970
Where is it?

3108
01:57:07,970 --> 01:57:08,890
Where was it?

3109
01:57:09,790 --> 01:57:10,650
I don't know!

3110
01:57:18,300 --> 01:57:19,380
Look, there you go.

3111
01:57:20,140 --> 01:57:20,540
How?

3112
01:57:21,320 --> 01:57:21,720
What?

3113
01:57:22,420 --> 01:57:23,760
You stupid son of a bitch.

3114
01:57:23,820 --> 01:57:24,760
You stupid son of a bitch.

3115
01:57:24,920 --> 01:57:25,620
I'm coming over.

3116
01:57:25,700 --> 01:57:26,060
I'm coming over.

3117
01:57:26,180 --> 01:57:26,640
I'm coming over.

3118
01:57:27,180 --> 01:57:27,580
Stop.

3119
01:57:27,740 --> 01:57:27,880
Stop.

3120
01:57:27,920 --> 01:57:28,060
Stop.

3121
01:57:28,060 --> 01:57:28,180
Stop.

3122
01:57:28,180 --> 01:57:28,300
Stop.

3123
01:57:28,300 --> 01:57:28,400
Stop.

3124
01:57:28,600 --> 01:57:29,660
Why me?

3125
01:57:30,040 --> 01:57:30,540
Why me?

3126
01:57:30,540 --> 01:57:32,400
There was an area that I could have avoided it in.

3127
01:57:32,620 --> 01:57:33,340
Why me?

3128
01:57:33,820 --> 01:57:34,480
Why me?

3129
01:57:37,840 --> 01:57:38,240
Okay.

3130
01:57:38,240 --> 01:57:38,640
Alright.

3131
01:57:40,520 --> 01:57:40,920
Wall.

3132
01:57:41,260 --> 01:57:41,940
The walls.

3133
01:57:42,440 --> 01:57:43,480
The walls!

3134
01:57:44,760 --> 01:57:45,400
The walls!

3135
01:57:45,580 --> 01:57:45,980
Okay.

3136
01:57:50,160 --> 01:57:50,440
Okay.

3137
01:57:50,540 --> 01:57:50,660
Okay.

3138
01:57:50,660 --> 01:57:50,660
Nice.

3139
01:57:52,360 --> 01:57:52,640
Okay.

3140
01:57:54,780 --> 01:57:55,640
It's already gooped!

3141
01:57:55,680 --> 01:57:56,220
It's already gooped!

3142
01:57:56,260 --> 01:57:56,820
It's already gooped!

3143
01:57:56,900 --> 01:57:57,280
It's already gooped!

3144
01:57:57,280 --> 01:57:57,380
Okay.

3145
01:58:00,700 --> 01:58:01,260
Jesus Christ.

3146
01:58:01,320 --> 01:58:03,260
How many fucking bees are we killing?

3147
01:58:05,240 --> 01:58:05,700
In front of me?

3148
01:58:05,700 --> 01:58:06,180
In front of me?

3149
01:58:06,400 --> 01:58:06,680
Okay.

3150
01:58:06,820 --> 01:58:07,600
I'm just gonna jump.

3151
01:58:07,740 --> 01:58:08,820
You know, we don't even need to goop this.

3152
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:09,480
We can just jump.

3153
01:58:09,780 --> 01:58:10,340
By the way.

3154
01:58:10,380 --> 01:58:10,880
I just noticed.

3155
01:58:11,620 --> 01:58:12,840
Well, we need to goop this one.

3156
01:58:14,700 --> 01:58:14,980
Um.

3157
01:58:15,020 --> 01:58:15,720
What do you think I'm doing?

3158
01:58:15,780 --> 01:58:16,340
What do you think I'm doing?

3159
01:58:16,380 --> 01:58:16,980
What do you think I'm doing?

3160
01:58:19,600 --> 01:58:20,260
What?

3161
01:58:20,360 --> 01:58:20,680
Why?

3162
01:58:21,060 --> 01:58:21,980
Why did you die?

3163
01:58:22,120 --> 01:58:23,480
What do you mean?

3164
01:58:23,680 --> 01:58:25,080
How did I die?

3165
01:58:25,820 --> 01:58:27,620
Why the fuck did you die?

3166
01:58:27,960 --> 01:58:29,380
Why did you die?

3167
01:58:33,020 --> 01:58:34,980
Why the fuck did you die?

3168
01:58:35,540 --> 01:58:37,860
I wonder how.

3169
01:58:38,500 --> 01:58:39,660
I wonder how.

3170
01:58:40,220 --> 01:58:41,580
Come on!

3171
01:58:42,060 --> 01:58:47,660
We're going by boat!

3172
01:58:47,660 --> 01:58:49,120
Help me out!

3173
01:58:49,420 --> 01:58:50,560
Help me out?

3174
01:58:51,140 --> 01:58:52,820
This is a boat?

3175
01:58:52,920 --> 01:58:54,680
Here we go.

3176
01:58:56,820 --> 01:58:58,240
Now there's water.

3177
01:58:58,660 --> 01:58:59,420
Now there's water.

3178
01:58:59,420 --> 01:59:00,320
Now it's the water level.

3179
01:59:00,760 --> 01:59:01,700
Everybody's favorite.

3180
01:59:02,020 --> 01:59:03,640
Now it's the water level.

3181
01:59:03,640 --> 01:59:03,760
Everybody's favorite.

3182
01:59:03,760 --> 01:59:05,560
Everybody loves water levels.

3183
01:59:05,900 --> 01:59:07,580
I love the water level music.

3184
01:59:08,120 --> 01:59:09,960
Don't we need like oars or something?

3185
01:59:10,380 --> 01:59:11,780
We don't need oars, Cody.

3186
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:12,760
We've got an engine.

3187
01:59:13,080 --> 01:59:13,640
We do?

3188
01:59:13,860 --> 01:59:17,200
Oh, the gulp!

3189
01:59:17,660 --> 01:59:17,860
No!

3190
01:59:19,060 --> 01:59:20,020
Engineer time!

3191
01:59:22,160 --> 01:59:22,640
What?

3192
01:59:23,980 --> 01:59:25,740
This is you and your engineer brain.

3193
01:59:25,980 --> 01:59:26,440
The physics!

3194
01:59:28,280 --> 01:59:29,080
He's a nun!

3195
01:59:29,220 --> 01:59:30,760
Not just your wooden face, Mei!

3196
01:59:32,720 --> 01:59:34,800
You have a beautiful wooden face.

3197
01:59:35,440 --> 01:59:35,920
Okay.

3198
01:59:36,540 --> 01:59:38,240
Our thing has a health bar, Doki.

3199
01:59:46,200 --> 01:59:47,640
Do you trust me?

3200
01:59:47,660 --> 01:59:49,020
Trust me...

3201
01:59:51,420 --> 01:59:51,940
Wait,

3202
01:59:56,060 --> 01:59:58,160
it doesn't even do damage if I hit it.

3203
01:59:58,320 --> 02:00:00,580
You have to make sure we don't land in the mines.

3204
02:00:03,020 --> 02:00:04,680
I can't see that one!

3205
02:00:07,420 --> 02:00:13,520
All I'm saying is that you have to make sure we don't land in the mines.

3206
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:16,200
Don't hit the trees so I can see the mines, please!

3207
02:00:19,400 --> 02:00:21,340
It's not my fault there!

3208
02:00:25,020 --> 02:00:26,040
Oh, this is easy.

3209
02:00:26,420 --> 02:00:28,380
It doesn't matter if we hit the side.

3210
02:00:30,500 --> 02:00:32,440
It matters for my eyesight.

3211
02:00:34,140 --> 02:00:35,160
Oh, that's a lot.

3212
02:00:35,300 --> 02:00:37,400
That's a lot of bugs coming in.

3213
02:00:37,980 --> 02:00:40,200
That's a lot of bugs coming in!

3214
02:00:41,900 --> 02:00:42,740
In front of us!

3215
02:00:42,780 --> 02:00:43,180
In front of us!

3216
02:00:43,220 --> 02:00:43,740
Turn to your left!

3217
02:00:43,800 --> 02:00:44,320
Turn to your left!

3218
02:00:44,340 --> 02:00:44,880
Turn to your left!

3219
02:00:45,500 --> 02:00:46,400
Right in front of you!

3220
02:00:48,100 --> 02:00:49,180
Where are you?

3221
02:00:49,180 --> 02:00:50,900
I'm aiming in front of us!

3222
02:00:52,020 --> 02:00:53,520
Not my front!

3223
02:00:54,840 --> 02:00:56,460
Girl, I don't know what your front is.

3224
02:00:56,460 --> 02:00:57,980
Why aren't you looking at my screen?

3225
02:00:59,640 --> 02:01:01,280
I'm not a screen peeker!

3226
02:01:03,520 --> 02:01:04,000
Hello?

3227
02:01:04,500 --> 02:01:04,980
Hello?

3228
02:01:05,160 --> 02:01:05,580
Hello?

3229
02:01:05,580 --> 02:01:06,280
Our game crashed.

3230
02:01:06,540 --> 02:01:07,020
Hello?

3231
02:01:07,520 --> 02:01:08,000
Hello?

3232
02:01:08,700 --> 02:01:09,180
What?

3233
02:01:11,760 --> 02:01:13,000
Do we have to do that again?

3234
02:01:14,120 --> 02:01:14,820
Do we?

3235
02:01:15,040 --> 02:01:15,600
Do we?

3236
02:01:17,100 --> 02:01:17,580
Hello?

3237
02:01:18,620 --> 02:01:19,260
Hello?

3238
02:01:20,920 --> 02:01:21,560
Hello?

3239
02:01:21,640 --> 02:01:22,280
Hello?

3240
02:01:22,540 --> 02:01:23,540
Can you hear me?

3241
02:01:24,260 --> 02:01:26,580
I... Yeah, I hear you.

3242
02:01:26,680 --> 02:01:27,940
Okay, okay.

3243
02:01:28,640 --> 02:01:29,600
Oh no.

3244
02:01:30,100 --> 02:01:31,500
This server died.

3245
02:01:31,940 --> 02:01:33,840
I'm not saying...

3246
02:01:33,840 --> 02:01:34,700
Oh, what?

3247
02:01:36,400 --> 02:01:37,040
No!

3248
02:01:37,040 --> 02:01:37,680
No!

3249
02:01:37,680 --> 02:01:39,360
Do we have to do that again?

3250
02:01:40,220 --> 02:01:42,800
No, I think we only have to do the ship part.

3251
02:01:43,220 --> 02:01:44,120
Oh, thank god.

3252
02:01:44,180 --> 02:01:46,140
Okay, I said to an invite.

3253
02:01:46,200 --> 02:01:47,180
Oh, thank god.

3254
02:01:47,180 --> 02:01:47,260
Okay, I said to an invite.

3255
02:01:50,850 --> 02:01:52,070
I sent you an invite.

3256
02:01:54,670 --> 02:01:55,390
Okay, proceed.

3257
02:01:58,610 --> 02:02:00,710
All right, don't worry.

3258
02:02:01,450 --> 02:02:02,970
This tap... Please don't tell me.

3259
02:02:03,030 --> 02:02:05,570
Oh my god, we have to do this again.

3260
02:02:06,490 --> 02:02:07,390
All right, here we go.

3261
02:02:08,430 --> 02:02:08,790
Hey!

3262
02:02:08,910 --> 02:02:09,090
Oh!

3263
02:02:09,090 --> 02:02:10,350
It's our ships full HP though.

3264
02:02:10,430 --> 02:02:11,910
It's like nothing bad ever happened.

3265
02:02:12,690 --> 02:02:13,370
In front of you.

3266
02:02:13,390 --> 02:02:13,990
In front of you.

3267
02:02:14,010 --> 02:02:14,650
In front of you.

3268
02:02:15,250 --> 02:02:15,870
My front.

3269
02:02:15,930 --> 02:02:16,330
My front.

3270
02:02:17,690 --> 02:02:18,910
I don't know what your front is.

3271
02:02:18,910 --> 02:02:19,390
My front.

3272
02:02:19,390 --> 02:02:19,870
My front.

3273
02:02:19,870 --> 02:02:19,970
I don't know.

3274
02:02:19,990 --> 02:02:20,590
Screen's fake!

3275
02:02:25,630 --> 02:02:26,950
It's okay, it's okay!

3276
02:02:27,130 --> 02:02:30,090
It's like we never lost HP so I never did anything wrong.

3277
02:02:30,610 --> 02:02:33,810
Yeah, look at that!

3278
02:02:34,210 --> 02:02:34,990
I'm gaming!

3279
02:02:37,910 --> 02:02:38,970
We lost HP.

3280
02:02:39,230 --> 02:02:40,530
Because you keep hitting it!

3281
02:02:40,670 --> 02:02:41,450
You keep hitting it!

3282
02:02:43,530 --> 02:02:48,630
How was I supposed to know this flimsy ass wood would lose HP?

3283
02:02:50,850 --> 02:02:51,370
How?

3284
02:02:56,620 --> 02:02:57,660
Oh shit.

3285
02:02:57,880 --> 02:02:58,600
Our HP!

3286
02:02:59,600 --> 02:03:01,300
I don't know where I am!

3287
02:03:01,300 --> 02:03:01,920
I'm lost!

3288
02:03:02,080 --> 02:03:03,480
Don't critic me!

3289
02:03:04,960 --> 02:03:06,000
Turn right!

3290
02:03:06,500 --> 02:03:07,280
I am!

3291
02:03:07,320 --> 02:03:07,780
Look, see?

3292
02:03:07,880 --> 02:03:08,800
I'm a good driver.

3293
02:03:09,820 --> 02:03:13,760
Look, I wouldn't be able to drive if you didn't yell at me.

3294
02:03:17,960 --> 02:03:20,080
Is that why our car's all banged up?

3295
02:03:21,840 --> 02:03:22,400
Uh oh.

3296
02:03:23,160 --> 02:03:23,960
Oh no.

3297
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:26,120
It's okay, what is he gonna do?

3298
02:03:26,440 --> 02:03:27,080
Kill us?

3299
02:03:29,700 --> 02:03:31,040
We're fine, see?

3300
02:03:31,460 --> 02:03:32,780
They're not gonna do anything to us.

3301
02:03:32,780 --> 02:03:33,620
It's like a tornado.

3302
02:03:33,920 --> 02:03:34,520
We're fine!

3303
02:03:34,840 --> 02:03:37,380
Oh, oh wait, that's a tornado.

3304
02:03:42,930 --> 02:03:44,930
Not... Oh, I have to drive past it.

3305
02:03:45,790 --> 02:03:47,710
Okay, don't worry, do you trust me?

3306
02:03:47,830 --> 02:03:48,290
Hey, it's all up to you, dog.

3307
02:03:48,710 --> 02:03:50,070
Do you trust me?

3308
02:03:51,150 --> 02:03:52,410
Anyways, I'm tabbing out.

3309
02:03:52,610 --> 02:03:54,430
Wait, wait a minute, wait a minute.

3310
02:03:54,430 --> 02:03:56,030
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

3311
02:03:56,250 --> 02:03:57,170
This is not fair.

3312
02:03:58,670 --> 02:03:59,490
Oh my god.

3313
02:03:59,730 --> 02:04:01,070
No, don't go away!

3314
02:04:04,250 --> 02:04:05,110
Where's the boat?

3315
02:04:05,570 --> 02:04:06,470
Where's the boat?

3316
02:04:07,030 --> 02:04:08,750
Go through the eye of the storm!

3317
02:04:09,090 --> 02:04:10,410
The eye of the storm!

3318
02:04:11,210 --> 02:04:12,470
What are you on about?

3319
02:04:12,570 --> 02:04:13,330
I'm on the boat!

3320
02:04:13,770 --> 02:04:15,750
Wait, how did you get... Where are you?

3321
02:04:15,970 --> 02:04:16,990
Where are you?

3322
02:04:17,050 --> 02:04:18,010
How did you get there?

3323
02:04:18,190 --> 02:04:19,470
Oh god, idiot!

3324
02:04:19,810 --> 02:04:21,310
How did you get there?

3325
02:04:22,070 --> 02:04:23,750
How do I get there?

3326
02:04:23,910 --> 02:04:24,570
I'm drowning!

3327
02:04:25,050 --> 02:04:26,110
At the top!

3328
02:04:26,310 --> 02:04:26,710
At the top!

3329
02:04:26,710 --> 02:04:27,690
I'm here, guys.

3330
02:04:28,290 --> 02:04:29,270
I'm here.

3331
02:04:30,650 --> 02:04:32,010
I did it.

3332
02:04:32,290 --> 02:04:34,930
Wait, I think it's easier if we go into the storm.

3333
02:04:35,570 --> 02:04:36,870
It's easier if...

3334
02:04:36,870 --> 02:04:39,290
No, because our boat's gonna freaking die.

3335
02:04:39,590 --> 02:04:41,510
I think it might be easier.

3336
02:04:42,090 --> 02:04:47,750
Goofy, I think... I think it's gonna be easier if we're in the tornado, Goofy.

3337
02:04:47,790 --> 02:04:48,490
You're pissing me off.

3338
02:04:48,650 --> 02:04:50,730
I think it's gonna be easier.

3339
02:04:50,730 --> 02:04:52,730
Stop crashing us!

3340
02:04:54,010 --> 02:04:55,270
We didn't lose HP!

3341
02:04:55,670 --> 02:04:56,250
We did it.

3342
02:04:56,290 --> 02:04:57,330
In front of you, in front of you, in front of you.

3343
02:04:57,390 --> 02:04:58,450
My front, my front, my front.

3344
02:04:59,930 --> 02:05:01,370
Look, see, we made it through.

3345
02:05:01,910 --> 02:05:03,250
We made it through.

3346
02:05:03,250 --> 02:05:04,370
Don't crash into that wall.

3347
02:05:04,710 --> 02:05:06,250
We made it through.

3348
02:05:07,670 --> 02:05:12,510
I mean, we don't have to have a wall if somebody hits the target.

3349
02:05:14,770 --> 02:05:17,550
Well, I have to be close enough to get the target.

3350
02:05:17,850 --> 02:05:18,010
Yeah!

3351
02:05:18,610 --> 02:05:19,670
We did it!

3352
02:05:20,730 --> 02:05:24,730
I, like, ripped onto my controller so fucking tightly...

3353
02:05:25,730 --> 02:05:26,890
...that my hand hurt.

3354
02:05:27,910 --> 02:05:30,210
Bro, you gotta relax, Goomy.

3355
02:05:30,570 --> 02:05:31,330
You gotta relax.

3356
02:05:32,730 --> 02:05:34,170
Hey, jellyfish.

3357
02:05:35,370 --> 02:05:36,350
Poke it.

3358
02:05:38,790 --> 02:05:40,370
Poke the jellyfish.

3359
02:05:43,550 --> 02:05:44,270
Okay.

3360
02:05:44,390 --> 02:05:44,750
I poked it.

3361
02:05:46,430 --> 02:05:47,510
You sure did.

3362
02:05:47,510 --> 02:05:47,710
I did.

3363
02:05:48,990 --> 02:05:53,710
For some reason, I thought it was that, like, Fighting Nemo DS game from the early 2000s.

3364
02:05:53,710 --> 02:05:54,330
Oh, yeah, yeah!

3365
02:05:54,350 --> 02:05:55,310
Then you could jump on the jellyfish.

3366
02:05:55,310 --> 02:05:56,370
You remember when you jumped on jellyfish?

3367
02:05:56,670 --> 02:05:56,730
Yeah.

3368
02:05:56,890 --> 02:05:58,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3369
02:05:58,470 --> 02:06:00,570
And then there was the mini games and the shark tank.

3370
02:06:01,430 --> 02:06:01,930
Mm-hmm.

3371
02:06:04,070 --> 02:06:05,630
Dude, I kinda missed those movie games.

3372
02:06:05,630 --> 02:06:05,650
I actually own that.

3373
02:06:05,670 --> 02:06:05,930
Yeah.

3374
02:06:06,450 --> 02:06:07,330
The good ones.

3375
02:06:07,330 --> 02:06:08,990
Not before they started, like...

3376
02:06:08,990 --> 02:06:10,050
Oh, that's a wall.

3377
02:06:10,170 --> 02:06:10,450
Okay.

3378
02:06:10,890 --> 02:06:12,910
Not before they... It's like, cash out.

3379
02:06:12,970 --> 02:06:14,630
They used to make actual good...

3380
02:06:15,370 --> 02:06:16,750
Actual good movie games.

3381
02:06:18,650 --> 02:06:19,550
What does that do?

3382
02:06:20,330 --> 02:06:21,430
I'll lift it up.

3383
02:06:21,570 --> 02:06:21,770
Oh!

3384
02:06:22,730 --> 02:06:23,430
Oh, look!

3385
02:06:23,650 --> 02:06:24,550
It's Nemo!

3386
02:06:24,570 --> 02:06:25,490
It's Fighting Nemo!

3387
02:06:25,770 --> 02:06:26,470
It's Nemo!

3388
02:06:26,470 --> 02:06:26,970
Nemo!

3389
02:06:26,970 --> 02:06:27,450
Nemo!

3390
02:06:27,450 --> 02:06:28,470
It's Nemo time!

3391
02:06:28,710 --> 02:06:29,890
Just keep swimming.

3392
02:06:33,010 --> 02:06:34,070
Oh, this is easy.

3393
02:06:34,210 --> 02:06:35,330
This is like platformers for...

3394
02:06:35,330 --> 02:06:37,590
I even cried while watching, uh, Fighting Dory.

3395
02:06:37,970 --> 02:06:38,810
Oh, you did?

3396
02:06:39,150 --> 02:06:40,130
Wait, what made you cry?

3397
02:06:40,130 --> 02:06:40,790
I don't remember why.

3398
02:06:42,410 --> 02:06:43,750
It's been so long.

3399
02:06:45,050 --> 02:06:45,790
Your turn.

3400
02:06:48,450 --> 02:06:49,270
Oh, it's this way.

3401
02:06:49,770 --> 02:06:53,090
I wonder if we like... If we didn't like that, would we be able to find it?

3402
02:06:53,210 --> 02:06:54,590
Would we be able to just go forward?

3403
02:06:55,110 --> 02:06:55,110
Oh, no!

3404
02:06:56,910 --> 02:06:58,210
Maybe speedrunners do that shit.

3405
02:06:58,890 --> 02:06:59,450
Oh, hey!

3406
02:06:59,810 --> 02:07:01,210
It's... It's like...

3407
02:07:02,230 --> 02:07:04,230
It's like... It's like caveman squirrels.

3408
02:07:04,570 --> 02:07:06,250
Wait, there's big Nemo squirrel.

3409
02:07:06,450 --> 02:07:06,470
Dude, giant squirrel.

3410
02:07:07,370 --> 02:07:08,170
Oh my god!

3411
02:07:08,210 --> 02:07:08,830
There it is!

3412
02:07:08,950 --> 02:07:09,630
There's a dead squirrel!

3413
02:07:09,950 --> 02:07:10,970
Holy shit!

3414
02:07:11,330 --> 02:07:12,590
That's a giant big squirrel.

3415
02:07:14,630 --> 02:07:15,690
And then... Oh, that's us!

3416
02:07:16,070 --> 02:07:17,670
I think they think we're good people.

3417
02:07:18,270 --> 02:07:19,590
I don't think so.

3418
02:07:19,650 --> 02:07:21,410
Look how angry our machine looks.

3419
02:07:23,250 --> 02:07:24,970
Wait... Is that us?

3420
02:07:25,170 --> 02:07:25,450
Yeah, look!

3421
02:07:25,490 --> 02:07:25,850
There's us!

3422
02:07:26,850 --> 02:07:27,510
That's me.

3423
02:07:27,630 --> 02:07:28,890
You can tell from my big...

3424
02:07:29,690 --> 02:07:30,170
Whoa!

3425
02:07:31,130 --> 02:07:31,610
What?

3426
02:07:32,710 --> 02:07:33,190
Whoa!

3427
02:07:33,730 --> 02:07:34,330
Hey, look!

3428
02:07:34,510 --> 02:07:36,110
Someone did not like that.

3429
02:07:36,130 --> 02:07:37,190
They love toilet paper!

3430
02:07:37,690 --> 02:07:38,150
They do?

3431
02:07:38,270 --> 02:07:38,470
Where?

3432
02:07:38,770 --> 02:07:39,530
Oh, they do!

3433
02:07:39,690 --> 02:07:40,850
They love toilet paper!

3434
02:07:41,550 --> 02:07:42,030
Yeah!

3435
02:07:44,630 --> 02:07:47,550
They love toilet paper and... and like all our other stuff.

3436
02:07:47,550 --> 02:07:48,510
And stealing from my stuff!

3437
02:07:48,850 --> 02:07:48,990
Yeah!

3438
02:07:49,330 --> 02:07:50,350
They love to steal.

3439
02:07:50,430 --> 02:07:51,730
So why are we helping them again?

3440
02:07:53,670 --> 02:07:55,410
Um... So we can get home or something.

3441
02:07:56,330 --> 02:07:56,670
Wait, what?

3442
02:07:58,630 --> 02:07:59,330
What are these?

3443
02:07:59,750 --> 02:08:00,530
Oh, can you light it?

3444
02:08:01,710 --> 02:08:02,110
No?

3445
02:08:03,770 --> 02:08:05,170
I think we can go down though.

3446
02:08:08,840 --> 02:08:09,240
Whee!

3447
02:08:09,260 --> 02:08:10,260
What the fuck is that?

3448
02:08:11,280 --> 02:08:12,160
Can I goop it?

3449
02:08:12,320 --> 02:08:13,160
Oh, what?

3450
02:08:13,160 --> 02:08:15,500
Magic is real!

3451
02:08:16,360 --> 02:08:16,920
Wow!

3452
02:08:17,500 --> 02:08:17,540
Woo!

3453
02:08:21,400 --> 02:08:21,960
Bam!

3454
02:08:22,100 --> 02:08:23,120
Ba-na-na!

3455
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,060
Ba-na-na-na-na-na-na-na!

3456
02:08:26,740 --> 02:08:27,300
Oh!

3457
02:08:27,400 --> 02:08:27,680
Oh!

3458
02:08:27,740 --> 02:08:28,520
I couldn't make it!

3459
02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:30,820
You have to like shoot yourself at it.

3460
02:08:32,060 --> 02:08:32,620
Yeah!

3461
02:08:34,260 --> 02:08:34,820
Nice.

3462
02:08:35,960 --> 02:08:37,020
I can aim.

3463
02:08:37,080 --> 02:08:37,940
Wait, I overshot it.

3464
02:08:38,900 --> 02:08:40,140
You have to hit that one.

3465
02:08:40,600 --> 02:08:41,340
I did.

3466
02:08:42,360 --> 02:08:44,020
Yay, cause I'm a gamer.

3467
02:08:45,200 --> 02:08:45,400
Huh?

3468
02:08:47,020 --> 02:08:48,120
Where's the next one though?

3469
02:08:48,860 --> 02:08:49,760
Oh, it's over here.

3470
02:08:49,980 --> 02:08:50,780
The next one flies.

3471
02:08:54,990 --> 02:08:56,190
Where does this take me?

3472
02:08:56,310 --> 02:08:57,770
Oh, I have to go in the... go in the hole.

3473
02:08:57,970 --> 02:08:58,830
Go in the hole.

3474
02:08:59,090 --> 02:08:59,870
See, I didn't miss the hole.

3475
02:08:59,870 --> 02:09:01,030
I'm literally right behind you.

3476
02:09:01,050 --> 02:09:02,510
I'm literally right behind you.

3477
02:09:02,590 --> 02:09:03,070
I didn't miss the hole.

3478
02:09:03,170 --> 02:09:04,210
Are you not proud of me?

3479
02:09:04,650 --> 02:09:05,570
Oh my god, there's a fish!

3480
02:09:05,570 --> 02:09:07,310
The hole is pretty darn big, I'll be honest.

3481
02:09:07,350 --> 02:09:08,050
It's the... the sea turtle.

3482
02:09:08,370 --> 02:09:10,350
What the... That's not a turtle.

3483
02:09:10,550 --> 02:09:11,470
It's like the sea turtle.

3484
02:09:11,750 --> 02:09:12,350
It's like Crash.

3485
02:09:12,630 --> 02:09:12,990
It's like catfish.

3486
02:09:14,690 --> 02:09:15,090
Oh!

3487
02:09:15,830 --> 02:09:16,610
It's like Crash.

3488
02:09:18,070 --> 02:09:19,430
No, it's like the stingray.

3489
02:09:23,030 --> 02:09:25,070
It's like the stingray that takes you to school.

3490
02:09:25,090 --> 02:09:26,230
We're going to go to school.

3491
02:09:32,050 --> 02:09:34,970
No, aren't catfish... don't catfish like eat everything?

3492
02:09:35,690 --> 02:09:36,470
Yeah, they do.

3493
02:09:36,530 --> 02:09:36,930
They're bottomless.

3494
02:09:37,330 --> 02:09:39,590
And they have taste buds all around their body.

3495
02:09:39,850 --> 02:09:41,890
Wait, so like they're tasting my feet right now?

3496
02:09:42,390 --> 02:09:43,170
Yeah, it is.

3497
02:09:46,410 --> 02:09:48,050
This is why we're getting divorced.

3498
02:09:48,650 --> 02:09:49,170
What?

3499
02:09:51,130 --> 02:09:52,610
I'm just showing you...what?

3500
02:09:55,370 --> 02:09:59,090
I'm sorry, that was my breaking... that is my lie.

3501
02:09:59,630 --> 02:10:00,930
That was the last straw.

3502
02:10:01,190 --> 02:10:02,670
That was the last straw!

3503
02:10:07,170 --> 02:10:08,990
Oh, it's like on its back now.

3504
02:10:09,490 --> 02:10:10,430
Wait, did you die?

3505
02:10:10,810 --> 02:10:11,330
Oh...

3506
02:10:12,070 --> 02:10:12,970
It did a flip.

3507
02:10:14,450 --> 02:10:17,410
Oh my god, look, it's showing us all these cool tricks that he can do.

3508
02:10:18,270 --> 02:10:18,830
Wait, look!

3509
02:10:19,250 --> 02:10:19,870
There's more!

3510
02:10:20,650 --> 02:10:21,470
There is more!

3511
02:10:21,590 --> 02:10:22,450
Do I have to jump on them?

3512
02:10:23,430 --> 02:10:25,090
No, I think it's just decoration.

3513
02:10:26,150 --> 02:10:26,550
No, I think it's just decoration.

3514
02:10:26,550 --> 02:10:29,290
Dude, this is cool and all, but like, stop making me move on this.

3515
02:10:29,410 --> 02:10:29,490
Dude, this is cool and all, but like, stop making me move on this.

3516
02:10:29,490 --> 02:10:30,470
This could have been a cutscene.

3517
02:10:35,190 --> 02:10:36,490
Oh my god, he's dead!

3518
02:10:36,850 --> 02:10:40,330
Fuck you, Cody!

3519
02:10:40,330 --> 02:10:41,990
Why are you blaming on me?

3520
02:10:42,870 --> 02:10:44,110
What did I do?

3521
02:10:48,190 --> 02:10:51,770
When we get divorced, you can't blame anything on me anymore.

3522
02:10:52,490 --> 02:10:53,690
You have to blame it on yourself.

3523
02:10:53,710 --> 02:10:54,950
Yeah, that's the point of my divorce, man.

3524
02:10:57,590 --> 02:10:59,470
You have to finally take responsibility.

3525
02:11:00,570 --> 02:11:02,130
Oh my god, I'm calling him.

3526
02:11:07,950 --> 02:11:10,150
Are you calling me fat?

3527
02:11:13,230 --> 02:11:14,050
Oh my god, man!

3528
02:11:14,190 --> 02:11:16,630
I let myself go because of you!

3529
02:11:17,830 --> 02:11:19,230
Because of me?!

3530
02:11:26,790 --> 02:11:28,890
Wait, where?

3531
02:11:29,050 --> 02:11:30,150
Oh, a shooting range.

3532
02:11:30,470 --> 02:11:31,090
Wait, what?

3533
02:11:32,230 --> 02:11:33,070
What are you gonna do?

3534
02:11:34,270 --> 02:11:36,350
Oh, it's over on the other side!

3535
02:11:38,810 --> 02:11:41,150
I'm just big boned, okay?

3536
02:11:41,210 --> 02:11:43,110
This is a dad bod right here.

3537
02:11:43,230 --> 02:11:44,550
People love dad bods.

3538
02:11:45,870 --> 02:11:46,550
Okay.

3539
02:11:48,110 --> 02:11:49,470
Un-charge.

3540
02:11:49,650 --> 02:11:50,090
Okay.

3541
02:11:57,600 --> 02:11:58,100
Wait, what?

3542
02:11:58,260 --> 02:11:58,760
Oh!

3543
02:11:59,700 --> 02:12:00,380
Oh,

3544
02:12:03,680 --> 02:12:04,860
I see!

3545
02:12:05,880 --> 02:12:07,980
Bro, the aim is so weird though.

3546
02:12:08,040 --> 02:12:08,500
For this.

3547
02:12:11,940 --> 02:12:14,140
Oh, it's the right stick!

3548
02:12:16,260 --> 02:12:17,200
Yeah, no.

3549
02:12:17,300 --> 02:12:18,460
I kinda don't like this.

3550
02:12:18,840 --> 02:12:19,580
Me too.

3551
02:12:20,100 --> 02:12:20,820
Oh no.

3552
02:12:21,100 --> 02:12:23,040
What do you mean there's like bullet fall off?

3553
02:12:23,600 --> 02:12:24,580
What the fuck?

3554
02:12:25,460 --> 02:12:26,520
What the fuck?

3555
02:12:26,560 --> 02:12:27,340
I don't like this.

3556
02:12:28,540 --> 02:12:29,940
I don't like this.

3557
02:12:33,320 --> 02:12:34,620
Oh my god.

3558
02:12:35,180 --> 02:12:36,760
Aiming with this is so hard.

3559
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:39,920
It's so difficult to aim with this.

3560
02:12:40,520 --> 02:12:42,240
I think I'm giving up.

3561
02:12:43,280 --> 02:12:45,700
I think I'm giving up.

3562
02:12:45,700 --> 02:12:46,140
Yeah!

3563
02:12:46,680 --> 02:12:47,160
FBS!

3564
02:12:47,800 --> 02:12:48,280
FBS!

3565
02:12:51,740 --> 02:12:52,780
This is it.

3566
02:12:52,780 --> 02:12:53,620
This is where the...

3567
02:12:54,040 --> 02:12:54,800
Gamer of the year.

3568
02:12:54,920 --> 02:12:56,400
Gamer of the year right here.

3569
02:12:56,520 --> 02:12:57,340
You're a controller player?

3570
02:12:57,360 --> 02:12:58,280
You're a controller player?

3571
02:12:58,400 --> 02:12:58,800
Is that it?

3572
02:12:58,920 --> 02:13:01,280
No, it doesn't matter what input I use.

3573
02:13:01,380 --> 02:13:02,680
I'm just gonna... I'm naturally gifted.

3574
02:13:05,040 --> 02:13:06,560
Dirty controller player.

3575
02:13:06,780 --> 02:13:07,700
Apex Legends get her.

3576
02:13:07,700 --> 02:13:10,800
I'm gonna put you on the left side now on my screen.

3577
02:13:13,760 --> 02:13:14,520
That doesn't matter.

3578
02:13:14,620 --> 02:13:16,380
I'm just naturally talented.

3579
02:13:17,880 --> 02:13:20,060
Explain the Mario Party game.

3580
02:13:20,600 --> 02:13:21,580
That's not...

3581
02:13:21,580 --> 02:13:22,640
That doesn't require aim.

3582
02:13:22,860 --> 02:13:24,700
That doesn't require aim.

3583
02:13:25,060 --> 02:13:25,800
That's why.

3584
02:13:26,600 --> 02:13:28,480
Explain the hammer game.

3585
02:13:28,480 --> 02:13:31,000
That looks like an elevator over there.

3586
02:13:31,100 --> 02:13:31,200
That looks like an elevator over there.

3587
02:13:31,320 --> 02:13:32,860
We have to cross over.

3588
02:13:35,700 --> 02:13:37,360
That's a deep pit.

3589
02:13:38,400 --> 02:13:38,980
It's okay.

3590
02:13:39,080 --> 02:13:39,640
We don't die.

3591
02:13:39,880 --> 02:13:40,780
What are you afraid of?

3592
02:13:41,200 --> 02:13:42,840
We don't even die.

3593
02:13:48,200 --> 02:13:49,300
Where are we supposed to...

3594
02:13:49,300 --> 02:13:49,520
Here?

3595
02:13:49,680 --> 02:13:50,060
Oh, okay.

3596
02:13:51,700 --> 02:13:53,600
How did I get here before you?

3597
02:13:54,620 --> 02:13:55,660
I was looking around.

3598
02:13:55,880 --> 02:13:56,280
Where are we going?

3599
02:13:56,540 --> 02:13:57,820
Only one way out.

3600
02:13:59,840 --> 02:14:00,980
Oh, look out.

3601
02:14:00,980 --> 02:14:01,300
These are here.

3602
02:14:02,360 --> 02:14:03,480
Oh, oh, oh!

3603
02:14:03,720 --> 02:14:04,640
Oh, okay.

3604
02:14:05,320 --> 02:14:06,740
Okay, I figured it out.

3605
02:14:06,860 --> 02:14:09,900
So, like, we have to avoid the bees on the wood platform.

3606
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:10,560
We didn't know.

3607
02:14:11,140 --> 02:14:11,540
Yeah.

3608
02:14:12,780 --> 02:14:14,980
I think I figured that out a bit earlier.

3609
02:14:15,020 --> 02:14:15,680
I'll be honest.

3610
02:14:19,900 --> 02:14:21,620
We have sort of time where they're...

3611
02:14:21,620 --> 02:14:23,360
see where they're gonna be arriving.

3612
02:14:25,540 --> 02:14:25,940
Yeah.

3613
02:14:27,880 --> 02:14:28,280
Oh.

3614
02:14:29,040 --> 02:14:30,620
Bro, this game is for babies.

3615
02:14:30,820 --> 02:14:31,460
Look at this.

3616
02:14:32,780 --> 02:14:34,420
This is a baby game.

3617
02:14:34,500 --> 02:14:35,220
We're so good.

3618
02:14:36,020 --> 02:14:38,380
I don't think it's a baby game since they're talking about divorce.

3619
02:14:38,760 --> 02:14:39,560
I don't think it's a baby game since they're talking about divorce.

3620
02:14:39,560 --> 02:14:41,280
No, babies need to learn early on.

3621
02:14:41,520 --> 02:14:43,300
We can't shelter these babies.

3622
02:14:44,080 --> 02:14:45,220
You know, you're right.

3623
02:14:45,480 --> 02:14:47,780
Yeah, babies don't need to be sheltered.

3624
02:14:50,720 --> 02:14:51,880
Oh, poop time!

3625
02:14:52,020 --> 02:14:52,500
Poop time!

3626
02:14:54,580 --> 02:14:55,300
Poop time!

3627
02:14:57,660 --> 02:14:58,340
There you go.

3628
02:14:59,680 --> 02:15:01,260
Nothing spawns behind us, right?

3629
02:15:01,360 --> 02:15:02,160
No, we're fine.

3630
02:15:02,220 --> 02:15:02,520
We're fine.

3631
02:15:02,580 --> 02:15:02,720
Yeah.

3632
02:15:03,360 --> 02:15:06,100
They only spawn in front of us because they're not that smart.

3633
02:15:06,860 --> 02:15:07,300
Okay.

3634
02:15:09,440 --> 02:15:10,560
How far are we going?

3635
02:15:11,240 --> 02:15:11,980
Going up.

3636
02:15:12,200 --> 02:15:13,420
To the top, baby!

3637
02:15:13,420 --> 02:15:14,120
To the moon!

3638
02:15:15,120 --> 02:15:15,980
Oh, fuck.

3639
02:15:16,060 --> 02:15:16,540
We're in a coliseum.

3640
02:15:17,220 --> 02:15:17,980
Oh, okay.

3641
02:15:18,060 --> 02:15:19,400
I think there's a boss fight here.

3642
02:15:20,180 --> 02:15:20,620
Ehh.

3643
02:15:21,020 --> 02:15:22,580
What is this place?

3644
02:15:24,260 --> 02:15:25,660
I don't know, but...

3645
02:15:26,220 --> 02:15:27,700
They look pretty angry.

3646
02:15:28,340 --> 02:15:29,140
Yeah, they do.

3647
02:15:32,420 --> 02:15:33,620
Wait, that's a beetle!

3648
02:15:33,920 --> 02:15:34,480
Oh, beetle!

3649
02:15:34,500 --> 02:15:35,240
Oh my god!

3650
02:15:35,280 --> 02:15:36,180
Oh, he's so cute!

3651
02:15:38,520 --> 02:15:39,940
Oh, are you ready for this?

3652
02:15:40,140 --> 02:15:41,180
I'm not sure.

3653
02:15:41,880 --> 02:15:42,900
He's so cute!

3654
02:15:43,700 --> 02:15:45,220
What's he gonna do to us?

3655
02:15:45,260 --> 02:15:46,340
He's so cute though.

3656
02:15:47,480 --> 02:15:48,420
Okay, I'm gooping.

3657
02:15:48,720 --> 02:15:50,880
Uh, the goop isn't showing up.

3658
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:52,180
Oh, I'm fucking dead.

3659
02:15:52,300 --> 02:15:53,300
This guy one-shots.

3660
02:15:53,720 --> 02:15:56,460
This guy one-shots.

3661
02:15:56,620 --> 02:15:57,820
This guy one-shots!

3662
02:15:59,900 --> 02:16:01,620
Oh, I think I know!

3663
02:16:01,660 --> 02:16:02,240
I think I know!

3664
02:16:02,240 --> 02:16:02,800
I think I know!

3665
02:16:03,760 --> 02:16:04,960
We gotta lead him here!

3666
02:16:10,680 --> 02:16:11,120
Um...

3667
02:16:11,120 --> 02:16:12,080
I think you were supposed to...

3668
02:16:12,080 --> 02:16:13,260
Why didn't you do all the floors first?

3669
02:16:14,900 --> 02:16:15,780
I'm dead.

3670
02:16:16,780 --> 02:16:18,580
He has to be right on top.

3671
02:16:18,840 --> 02:16:19,680
Okay, alright.

3672
02:16:21,300 --> 02:16:22,400
I'm gooping out here.

3673
02:16:22,460 --> 02:16:23,100
I'm gooping here.

3674
02:16:23,220 --> 02:16:24,040
I'm gooping here.

3675
02:16:24,080 --> 02:16:24,720
I'm gooping here.

3676
02:16:25,200 --> 02:16:26,140
He's running at you?

3677
02:16:26,360 --> 02:16:27,200
I'm gooping here.

3678
02:16:27,200 --> 02:16:32,320
Alright, I'm gonna stand here and then like you make sure to shoot it the moment he runs at us.

3679
02:16:32,560 --> 02:16:33,880
You make sure to shoot it!

3680
02:16:36,040 --> 02:16:37,320
You make sure to shoot it!

3681
02:16:37,320 --> 02:16:38,640
You make sure to shoot it the moment he runs over.

3682
02:16:38,800 --> 02:16:39,100
You make sure to shoot it the moment he runs over.

3683
02:16:39,100 --> 02:16:39,540
Okay, yes!

3684
02:16:39,620 --> 02:16:40,060
Nice!

3685
02:16:40,140 --> 02:16:40,540
That's it!

3686
02:16:40,580 --> 02:16:41,500
That's all we have to do!

3687
02:16:41,920 --> 02:16:43,440
His shell is too strong!

3688
02:16:44,840 --> 02:16:46,620
Oh shit, he can fly now!

3689
02:16:47,960 --> 02:16:49,080
Okay, don't worry.

3690
02:16:50,040 --> 02:16:50,480
Nice!

3691
02:16:51,300 --> 02:16:52,020
I'm bait!

3692
02:16:55,320 --> 02:16:55,680
I'm bait!

3693
02:16:55,680 --> 02:16:56,740
Okay, it doesn't go up yet.

3694
02:16:57,880 --> 02:16:59,020
Oh, he's doing a double jump.

3695
02:16:59,140 --> 02:17:00,220
He's doing a triple jump.

3696
02:17:00,320 --> 02:17:01,260
Oh baby, a triple!

3697
02:17:02,800 --> 02:17:03,160
Oh!

3698
02:17:03,180 --> 02:17:04,000
It hit on me!

3699
02:17:04,480 --> 02:17:05,900
I told you he won't shoot!

3700
02:17:06,120 --> 02:17:07,180
I told you he won't shoot!

3701
02:17:07,320 --> 02:17:08,040
He flipped over!

3702
02:17:08,620 --> 02:17:09,340
Okay, it's okay.

3703
02:17:09,460 --> 02:17:09,700
It's okay.

3704
02:17:09,760 --> 02:17:10,060
I gooped.

3705
02:17:11,900 --> 02:17:12,480
I'm bait!

3706
02:17:12,560 --> 02:17:12,880
I'm bait!

3707
02:17:12,900 --> 02:17:13,240
I'm bait!

3708
02:17:13,260 --> 02:17:13,620
I'm bait!

3709
02:17:13,660 --> 02:17:14,000
I'm bait!

3710
02:17:16,580 --> 02:17:16,940
There!

3711
02:17:17,400 --> 02:17:17,760
Nice!

3712
02:17:23,150 --> 02:17:24,650
Please, please, please, please, please.

3713
02:17:27,230 --> 02:17:27,910
Alright, here we go.

3714
02:17:28,230 --> 02:17:29,310
Oh no, you're bait now.

3715
02:17:29,410 --> 02:17:29,790
You're bait.

3716
02:17:29,850 --> 02:17:30,150
You're bait.

3717
02:17:30,210 --> 02:17:30,730
Yeah, yeah, it's fine.

3718
02:17:30,770 --> 02:17:31,650
We can wait for him to walk.

3719
02:17:31,730 --> 02:17:32,170
He's charging!

3720
02:17:32,310 --> 02:17:32,670
He wants to charge!

3721
02:17:32,710 --> 02:17:33,110
He wants to charge!

3722
02:17:33,150 --> 02:17:33,410
You're ready!

3723
02:17:35,070 --> 02:17:35,390
Yeah!

3724
02:17:35,390 --> 02:17:36,110
We did it!

3725
02:17:36,730 --> 02:17:37,050
Nice!

3726
02:17:37,690 --> 02:17:38,330
We're gaming!

3727
02:17:45,530 --> 02:17:45,850
Oh!

3728
02:17:45,870 --> 02:17:46,030
Oh!

3729
02:17:46,890 --> 02:17:47,810
I'm just a beetle!

3730
02:17:50,590 --> 02:17:51,830
Sounds like Seth Rogan.

3731
02:17:58,490 --> 02:17:58,810
Worms!

3732
02:17:59,450 --> 02:18:00,010
Slugs?

3733
02:18:00,330 --> 02:18:00,890
Larvae?

3734
02:18:01,030 --> 02:18:01,250
No!

3735
02:18:01,510 --> 02:18:02,710
I'm a vegetarian!

3736
02:18:03,290 --> 02:18:04,450
And gluten free!

3737
02:18:04,710 --> 02:18:05,230
Oh!

3738
02:18:05,530 --> 02:18:06,090
Oh!

3739
02:18:06,930 --> 02:18:07,490
Okay.

3740
02:18:07,490 --> 02:18:08,510
Well, uh...

3741
02:18:08,510 --> 02:18:09,670
You know the queen?

3742
02:18:09,730 --> 02:18:11,630
She has all the nectar.

3743
02:18:11,890 --> 02:18:17,130
So if you help us take her down, you can have as much nectar as you want.

3744
02:18:17,170 --> 02:18:18,570
Shake my head, not loyal.

3745
02:18:18,850 --> 02:18:19,030
Gaslighter!

3746
02:18:19,310 --> 02:18:19,870
Gaslighter!

3747
02:18:22,450 --> 02:18:23,010
Yummy!

3748
02:18:23,430 --> 02:18:26,150
What are we waiting for?

3749
02:18:26,410 --> 02:18:26,830
Come on!

3750
02:18:26,910 --> 02:18:27,390
Jump on!

3751
02:18:28,030 --> 02:18:28,590
Oh!

3752
02:18:28,650 --> 02:18:28,930
Oh!

3753
02:18:29,030 --> 02:18:29,530
We got him!

3754
02:18:29,550 --> 02:18:30,090
We're on a ride now!

3755
02:18:30,390 --> 02:18:30,710
Nice!

3756
02:18:31,510 --> 02:18:33,310
Shake my head, not loyal though.

3757
02:18:33,530 --> 02:18:34,910
Wait, how do we...

3758
02:18:34,910 --> 02:18:35,410
Oh!

3759
02:18:35,410 --> 02:18:35,730
You shoot!

3760
02:18:35,830 --> 02:18:36,410
You're the aimer!

3761
02:18:36,470 --> 02:18:37,110
You're the aimer!

3762
02:18:38,510 --> 02:18:39,710
You have to shoot!

3763
02:18:41,390 --> 02:18:42,630
You have to shoot too!

3764
02:18:42,830 --> 02:18:43,150
No!

3765
02:18:43,210 --> 02:18:43,830
I move!

3766
02:18:44,050 --> 02:18:45,210
I move and jump!

3767
02:18:45,250 --> 02:18:45,710
You shoot!

3768
02:18:46,210 --> 02:18:47,650
I move and jump!

3769
02:18:47,690 --> 02:18:48,230
You shoot!

3770
02:18:48,670 --> 02:18:49,570
Where's the shoot?

3771
02:18:50,030 --> 02:18:51,670
Stop backseat shooting!

3772
02:18:52,110 --> 02:18:52,550
Yeah!

3773
02:18:52,910 --> 02:18:53,470
Whoa!

3774
02:18:55,250 --> 02:18:55,810
Okay.

3775
02:18:55,810 --> 02:18:56,770
Okay.

3776
02:18:56,950 --> 02:18:57,890
I jump.

3777
02:18:58,330 --> 02:18:59,290
Let me go.

3778
02:18:59,810 --> 02:19:01,270
Just remember to shoot.

3779
02:19:01,870 --> 02:19:03,010
You know what's crazy?

3780
02:19:03,150 --> 02:19:05,370
You were moving the exact same way I was moving.

3781
02:19:05,490 --> 02:19:06,250
Wait, really?

3782
02:19:06,550 --> 02:19:06,850
That's...

3783
02:19:06,850 --> 02:19:08,910
I thought I was moving.

3784
02:19:11,050 --> 02:19:12,650
Someone wasn't reading.

3785
02:19:13,610 --> 02:19:14,170
Someone wasn't reading.

3786
02:19:15,730 --> 02:19:17,230
Someone wasn't reading.

3787
02:19:18,110 --> 02:19:20,150
This does not have to do with reading!

3788
02:19:20,490 --> 02:19:21,070
It just...

3789
02:19:21,650 --> 02:19:22,650
It's called...

3790
02:19:24,090 --> 02:19:24,650
reflexes.

3791
02:19:26,010 --> 02:19:26,510
See?

3792
02:19:27,110 --> 02:19:28,110
I jumped.

3793
02:19:29,450 --> 02:19:29,950
See?

3794
02:19:36,190 --> 02:19:36,190
I jumped.

3795
02:19:36,190 --> 02:19:36,830
You could have shot that.

3796
02:19:38,270 --> 02:19:39,250
No, I couldn't have.

3797
02:19:39,410 --> 02:19:40,890
You jumped into the barrels.

3798
02:19:40,950 --> 02:19:42,030
You could have shot that.

3799
02:19:42,490 --> 02:19:45,210
What are we talking about?

3800
02:19:45,570 --> 02:19:46,070
Shoot!

3801
02:19:46,110 --> 02:19:46,310
Shoot!

3802
02:19:46,330 --> 02:19:46,590
Shoot!

3803
02:19:46,590 --> 02:19:46,770
Shoot!

3804
02:19:47,870 --> 02:19:48,830
It's shooting time!

3805
02:19:52,190 --> 02:19:52,930
Alright, nice.

3806
02:19:53,070 --> 02:19:53,710
And then I...

3807
02:19:53,710 --> 02:19:54,130
jump!

3808
02:19:55,970 --> 02:19:56,850
Look at me go.

3809
02:19:57,070 --> 02:19:57,930
I'm a good driver.

3810
02:19:58,130 --> 02:19:59,570
Better don't get us killed if you won't die.

3811
02:19:59,570 --> 02:20:00,770
I have a driver's license.

3812
02:20:02,370 --> 02:20:03,210
Um, okay.

3813
02:20:03,330 --> 02:20:04,290
I have a drive-thru.

3814
02:20:05,530 --> 02:20:05,950
No!

3815
02:20:05,950 --> 02:20:06,530
Still go!

3816
02:20:06,670 --> 02:20:07,090
Yeah!

3817
02:20:08,530 --> 02:20:09,310
Nice one, Mae!

3818
02:20:10,010 --> 02:20:10,430
Pew!

3819
02:20:12,410 --> 02:20:13,770
Wait, would it matter?

3820
02:20:13,950 --> 02:20:15,030
Would it just fall on us?

3821
02:20:15,770 --> 02:20:16,190
Maybe.

3822
02:20:16,450 --> 02:20:17,250
Like a bomb?

3823
02:20:18,550 --> 02:20:19,290
Let me go.

3824
02:20:19,590 --> 02:20:21,230
That's when you know I'm a good driver.

3825
02:20:21,410 --> 02:20:21,710
Pew!

3826
02:20:21,710 --> 02:20:21,990
Meow.

3827
02:20:23,390 --> 02:20:24,070
Meow.

3828
02:20:25,930 --> 02:20:27,290
What did you do?

3829
02:20:27,370 --> 02:20:28,050
You crushed!

3830
02:20:28,690 --> 02:20:30,650
You didn't shoot!

3831
02:20:31,170 --> 02:20:32,010
You didn't!

3832
02:20:32,150 --> 02:20:34,690
That wasn't odd that you fucking crushed into that!

3833
02:20:37,030 --> 02:20:38,930
Our perfect run!

3834
02:20:42,510 --> 02:20:43,430
Nailed it.

3835
02:20:44,970 --> 02:20:45,650
Um...

3836
02:20:46,650 --> 02:20:48,350
Well, you could have flew all along.

3837
02:20:49,630 --> 02:20:51,830
You could have just flown all along for us.

3838
02:20:51,890 --> 02:20:52,250
Um...

3839
02:20:55,770 --> 02:20:57,930
I think he regrets working for us.

3840
02:20:58,230 --> 02:20:59,450
What the fuck!

3841
02:20:59,490 --> 02:21:00,290
He's on fire!

3842
02:21:06,600 --> 02:21:07,620
What the fuck!

3843
02:21:07,840 --> 02:21:08,920
And now he can fly.

3844
02:21:10,040 --> 02:21:10,600
Oh!

3845
02:21:10,620 --> 02:21:11,100
Oh!

3846
02:21:12,400 --> 02:21:13,320
That's fucked up.

3847
02:21:13,800 --> 02:21:15,440
We Yoshi'd him.

3848
02:21:15,640 --> 02:21:17,340
We'll just grab another beetle later.

3849
02:21:18,180 --> 02:21:19,320
Damn, that's crazy.

3850
02:21:20,440 --> 02:21:25,120
If Mario can do it and have a billion dollar company, we can too.

3851
02:21:25,400 --> 02:21:27,180
We know you're not the real queen.

3852
02:21:37,050 --> 02:21:38,270
There's a squirrel in there.

3853
02:21:39,490 --> 02:21:40,630
There's a squirrel in there.

3854
02:21:41,290 --> 02:21:41,650
100%.

3855
02:21:41,650 --> 02:21:43,310
They said that in the lore, man.

3856
02:21:45,050 --> 02:21:45,830
I gooped it!

3857
02:21:45,890 --> 02:21:46,310
I gooped it!

3858
02:21:46,370 --> 02:21:46,790
I gooped it!

3859
02:21:46,810 --> 02:21:47,250
I gooped it!

3860
02:21:51,610 --> 02:21:52,390
I gooped it!

3861
02:21:52,530 --> 02:21:52,950
I gooped it!

3862
02:21:53,230 --> 02:21:54,430
Slowly tip it away!

3863
02:21:56,670 --> 02:21:57,370
I had left.

3864
02:21:57,450 --> 02:21:57,850
I did the button!

3865
02:21:58,210 --> 02:21:59,530
What are you doing?

3866
02:21:59,630 --> 02:22:00,390
What are you doing?

3867
02:22:00,570 --> 02:22:01,590
What are you doing?

3868
02:22:01,850 --> 02:22:02,510
Where's the...

3869
02:22:02,510 --> 02:22:03,930
What are you doing?

3870
02:22:04,870 --> 02:22:06,750
Why did you leave?

3871
02:22:07,850 --> 02:22:09,110
Why did you leave?

3872
02:22:09,750 --> 02:22:10,950
I don't wanna get hurt.

3873
02:22:11,190 --> 02:22:13,590
What do you mean I gooped the fucking button?

3874
02:22:13,910 --> 02:22:15,810
What do you mean I gooped the fucking button?

3875
02:22:16,170 --> 02:22:18,610
Okay, now we go on it.

3876
02:22:23,970 --> 02:22:24,970
Okay, let's see.

3877
02:22:25,030 --> 02:22:25,390
Easy.

3878
02:22:26,990 --> 02:22:27,920
How do we...

3879
02:22:28,910 --> 02:22:29,670
Where's the...

3880
02:22:29,670 --> 02:22:29,770
Oh!

3881
02:22:29,890 --> 02:22:30,410
Wait, wait, wait!

3882
02:22:30,870 --> 02:22:31,910
Oh, wait, no?

3883
02:22:32,450 --> 02:22:33,370
Where's the...

3884
02:22:35,530 --> 02:22:37,590
Wait, but where's the... where's the funnel?

3885
02:22:37,670 --> 02:22:37,990
Where's the funnel now?

3886
02:22:41,290 --> 02:22:42,150
Where's the funnel?

3887
02:22:43,310 --> 02:22:44,590
I can't find it.

3888
02:22:47,810 --> 02:22:49,310
Do we do backshots?

3889
02:22:50,470 --> 02:22:51,670
I think we do backshots.

3890
02:22:52,450 --> 02:22:53,930
I'm trying to find the funnel.

3891
02:22:56,530 --> 02:22:57,750
Wait, where did you shoot?

3892
02:22:58,030 --> 02:22:59,250
It's wherever the X is!

3893
02:23:00,410 --> 02:23:00,870
Backshots!

3894
02:23:00,870 --> 02:23:01,330
Backshots!

3895
02:23:01,410 --> 02:23:01,870
Backshots!

3896
02:23:01,930 --> 02:23:02,390
Backshots!

3897
02:23:02,390 --> 02:23:02,670
Backshots!

3898
02:23:02,770 --> 02:23:03,090
Backshots!

3899
02:23:03,970 --> 02:23:04,470
It's okay.

3900
02:23:04,910 --> 02:23:05,870
There's an X right here.

3901
02:23:05,910 --> 02:23:06,670
There's an X right here.

3902
02:23:09,350 --> 02:23:10,550
Oh my god.

3903
02:23:10,610 --> 02:23:10,830
Okay.

3904
02:23:11,470 --> 02:23:12,850
Oh, how did I fail?

3905
02:23:12,950 --> 02:23:13,810
I don't understand!

3906
02:23:18,630 --> 02:23:19,850
Don't worry I'm coming back.

3907
02:23:19,990 --> 02:23:20,790
Oh yeah, okay.

3908
02:23:20,850 --> 02:23:21,510
I'm gooping.

3909
02:23:21,650 --> 02:23:23,090
I'm gooping wherever the X is.

3910
02:23:23,770 --> 02:23:25,130
But he's looking at me.

3911
02:23:25,130 --> 02:23:25,650
I can't!

3912
02:23:27,290 --> 02:23:28,950
Oh the bees are looking at me.

3913
02:23:29,290 --> 02:23:30,570
Oh the bees are looking at me.

3914
02:23:30,570 --> 02:23:31,310
I shot the coochie.

3915
02:23:31,870 --> 02:23:33,190
You shot the coochie?

3916
02:23:33,750 --> 02:23:35,410
There's two X's on the back.

3917
02:23:35,770 --> 02:23:36,790
Actual backshots!

3918
02:23:37,050 --> 02:23:37,650
I can't do it.

3919
02:23:37,650 --> 02:23:37,650
I can't do it.

3920
02:23:37,650 --> 02:23:37,650
I can't do it.

3921
02:23:37,670 --> 02:23:38,550
There's bees blocking!

3922
02:23:39,590 --> 02:23:40,850
You guys shoot the bees!

3923
02:23:41,390 --> 02:23:42,070
I did!

3924
02:23:44,150 --> 02:23:44,550
Okay.

3925
02:23:44,550 --> 02:23:45,130
Okay, okay.

3926
02:23:45,270 --> 02:23:46,110
I'm going back, back.

3927
02:23:46,210 --> 02:23:47,090
I'm going back in the back.

3928
02:23:51,360 --> 02:23:53,000
She's looking at me but I got the...

3929
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:53,680
I got the edX.

3930
02:23:53,780 --> 02:23:54,180
Coochie down!

3931
02:23:54,280 --> 02:23:54,880
Coochie down!

3932
02:23:56,540 --> 02:23:57,340
Ass time!

3933
02:23:58,520 --> 02:23:59,940
Oh, the airstrike.

3934
02:24:00,220 --> 02:24:01,020
Oh my god!

3935
02:24:03,100 --> 02:24:03,500
Ow!

3936
02:24:03,660 --> 02:24:04,060
What?

3937
02:24:04,100 --> 02:24:05,620
How was I supposed to...

3938
02:24:06,900 --> 02:24:08,940
I died because I was off screen!

3939
02:24:09,620 --> 02:24:10,600
That's fucked up.

3940
02:24:12,620 --> 02:24:13,840
That's fucked up, man.

3941
02:24:15,040 --> 02:24:16,040
Oh my god.

3942
02:24:16,060 --> 02:24:16,680
Oh my god.

3943
02:24:16,720 --> 02:24:17,260
Oh my god.

3944
02:24:17,340 --> 02:24:17,900
Okay, we're okay.

3945
02:24:18,880 --> 02:24:19,980
Spread out, you heard her.

3946
02:24:20,860 --> 02:24:21,500
Spread out.

3947
02:24:23,480 --> 02:24:25,580
Where do they go after the bomb?

3948
02:24:27,100 --> 02:24:29,280
I can just stand still and just jump from here.

3949
02:24:30,840 --> 02:24:31,940
I don't have to move.

3950
02:24:32,820 --> 02:24:33,260
Okay.

3951
02:24:34,400 --> 02:24:34,840
Alright.

3952
02:24:35,620 --> 02:24:36,900
Come with me, come with me, come with me.

3953
02:24:36,920 --> 02:24:37,780
It's the backshot time.

3954
02:24:39,020 --> 02:24:40,160
Backshot, backshot, backshot.

3955
02:24:40,260 --> 02:24:40,660
I got the back.

3956
02:24:40,720 --> 02:24:41,700
I got the back.

3957
02:24:42,640 --> 02:24:43,580
It's looking at me.

3958
02:24:43,980 --> 02:24:44,740
I got the back.

3959
02:24:44,920 --> 02:24:45,600
Well, that sucks.

3960
02:24:45,980 --> 02:24:47,220
Okay, I got the back.

3961
02:24:47,560 --> 02:24:48,200
I got it.

3962
02:24:51,820 --> 02:24:52,520
Where am I?

3963
02:24:53,280 --> 02:24:54,700
I was off screen!

3964
02:24:55,780 --> 02:24:56,860
That's what I said!

3965
02:24:57,660 --> 02:24:58,800
This is fucked up.

3966
02:24:58,860 --> 02:24:59,700
This is bullshit.

3967
02:25:00,580 --> 02:25:01,720
This is so bullshit.

3968
02:25:04,080 --> 02:25:04,620
We're good.

3969
02:25:04,780 --> 02:25:05,600
I can stand still.

3970
02:25:05,760 --> 02:25:05,940
Oh.

3971
02:25:06,980 --> 02:25:07,520
Don't stand still, by the way.

3972
02:25:07,560 --> 02:25:08,100
Don't stand still.

3973
02:25:10,240 --> 02:25:11,600
You gotta keep moving.

3974
02:25:12,740 --> 02:25:14,500
I've learned that you gotta keep moving.

3975
02:25:14,960 --> 02:25:16,440
Hey, look at my health bar.

3976
02:25:17,760 --> 02:25:18,280
It's okay.

3977
02:25:18,360 --> 02:25:20,800
It's a good thing that your Fuki is hiding the health bar.

3978
02:25:20,900 --> 02:25:22,800
So they won't know if you got hit or not.

3979
02:25:24,440 --> 02:25:25,900
I didn't die, by the way, guys.

3980
02:25:26,040 --> 02:25:26,740
I didn't get hit.

3981
02:25:26,860 --> 02:25:27,660
My full HP.

3982
02:25:28,480 --> 02:25:29,760
You're at half HP.

3983
02:25:29,900 --> 02:25:30,760
No, I'm full HP.

3984
02:25:32,180 --> 02:25:33,080
I'm shooting the back.

3985
02:25:34,820 --> 02:25:36,140
Backshot, backshot, backshot.

3986
02:25:36,980 --> 02:25:37,340
Back is goop.

3987
02:25:37,340 --> 02:25:38,080
Back is goop.

3988
02:25:40,400 --> 02:25:42,200
I have gooped the back successfully.

3989
02:25:45,480 --> 02:25:47,040
Backshot, backshot, backshot.

3990
02:25:47,160 --> 02:25:48,060
I'm gooping the...

3991
02:25:48,060 --> 02:25:49,300
There's too many bees.

3992
02:25:50,360 --> 02:25:51,980
You gotta keep shooting the bees.

3993
02:25:52,420 --> 02:25:54,000
I have to reload sometime.

3994
02:25:55,200 --> 02:25:56,160
That's a you problem.

3995
02:25:56,500 --> 02:25:57,620
I have backshot, backshot.

3996
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,700
I'm trying to goop, but they won't let me.

3997
02:26:00,740 --> 02:26:01,820
They're protecting the queen.

3998
02:26:02,820 --> 02:26:03,760
We have to split.

3999
02:26:03,860 --> 02:26:04,620
We have to split.

4000
02:26:04,620 --> 02:26:05,920
You go the other side.

4001
02:26:09,420 --> 02:26:10,440
Okay, it's looking at me.

4002
02:26:10,500 --> 02:26:11,380
I don't know what to do.

4003
02:26:13,160 --> 02:26:14,220
Oh, I got it, I got it, I got it.

4004
02:26:14,220 --> 02:26:15,060
It's literally attacking me.

4005
02:26:15,060 --> 02:26:15,860
I got it, I got it, I got it.

4006
02:26:16,080 --> 02:26:16,900
I got it, I got it, I got it.

4007
02:26:18,240 --> 02:26:18,480
Okay,

4008
02:26:21,600 --> 02:26:22,380
okay, I'm going back up.

4009
02:26:22,420 --> 02:26:23,000
I'm going back up.

4010
02:26:25,040 --> 02:26:25,580
I'm doing it.

4011
02:26:25,620 --> 02:26:26,000
I got the back.

4012
02:26:26,420 --> 02:26:26,860
It's your turn.

4013
02:26:27,040 --> 02:26:27,240
It's your turn.

4014
02:26:28,240 --> 02:26:28,920
It's fully backed.

4015
02:26:32,480 --> 02:26:32,720
Backshot!

4016
02:26:32,720 --> 02:26:33,000
Yeah!

4017
02:26:34,560 --> 02:26:35,560
What the fuck?

4018
02:26:38,140 --> 02:26:38,700
Where am I?

4019
02:26:40,960 --> 02:26:41,880
Wait, where do we shoot?

4020
02:26:41,980 --> 02:26:42,780
Oh, here, here, here.

4021
02:26:42,940 --> 02:26:43,500
Yeah, yeah.

4022
02:26:46,360 --> 02:26:48,180
It's the wire.

4023
02:26:48,880 --> 02:26:49,980
I know, I know.

4024
02:26:51,040 --> 02:26:51,400
Try.

4025
02:26:52,080 --> 02:26:52,440
What?

4026
02:26:52,520 --> 02:26:53,240
I didn't see it.

4027
02:26:53,300 --> 02:26:53,780
I didn't see it.

4028
02:26:54,460 --> 02:26:55,060
Don't get me.

4029
02:27:01,060 --> 02:27:01,780
You're welcome.

4030
02:27:03,680 --> 02:27:04,260
Okay, okay.

4031
02:27:04,760 --> 02:27:06,040
The bees, the bees, the bees.

4032
02:27:06,120 --> 02:27:07,060
What do we do about the bees?

4033
02:27:07,640 --> 02:27:08,120
I'm gonna shoot the bees.

4034
02:27:08,480 --> 02:27:08,720
Ow!

4035
02:27:11,720 --> 02:27:12,600
You gotta shoot the bees.

4036
02:27:12,660 --> 02:27:14,340
I can't aim at the things because of the bees.

4037
02:27:14,500 --> 02:27:14,580
I am!

4038
02:27:14,580 --> 02:27:14,680
I am!

4039
02:27:15,320 --> 02:27:16,700
Okay, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.

4040
02:27:19,400 --> 02:27:20,480
You gotta keep aiming the bees.

4041
02:27:20,560 --> 02:27:21,560
You gotta keep aiming at the bees.

4042
02:27:23,560 --> 02:27:24,440
Oh, I got it, I got it.

4043
02:27:24,640 --> 02:27:26,240
I don't got it, I don't got it, I don't got it.

4044
02:27:26,360 --> 02:27:27,920
I got it, I don't got it, I don't got it.

4045
02:27:29,380 --> 02:27:30,160
Oh god, oh god.

4046
02:27:30,460 --> 02:27:31,260
I need to reload.

4047
02:27:33,060 --> 02:27:34,300
I'm getting dehydrated.

4048
02:27:37,300 --> 02:27:38,260
Oh, I got it, I got it!

4049
02:27:38,580 --> 02:27:39,040
There you go.

4050
02:27:39,600 --> 02:27:40,520
There you go!

4051
02:27:41,900 --> 02:27:43,420
Okay, bees, bees, bees!

4052
02:27:44,360 --> 02:27:45,400
Bees, bees, bees!

4053
02:27:47,640 --> 02:27:48,700
Bees, bees, bees!

4054
02:27:49,280 --> 02:27:50,120
It's good, it's good!

4055
02:27:50,160 --> 02:27:50,720
Last shot, last shot!

4056
02:27:51,300 --> 02:27:52,040
We got it!

4057
02:28:05,740 --> 02:28:06,680
Where's the squirrel?

4058
02:28:08,280 --> 02:28:09,720
Wait, it was a bee!

4059
02:28:09,940 --> 02:28:10,820
That's not...

4060
02:28:11,660 --> 02:28:12,940
It is a bee!

4061
02:28:13,180 --> 02:28:18,940
She's a fake!

4062
02:28:23,960 --> 02:28:27,040
Wait, then how do they get more wasps?

4063
02:28:41,560 --> 02:28:42,720
Oh, shit!

4064
02:28:48,090 --> 02:28:53,170
But like, how do they make the bee wasp make more wasps?

4065
02:28:54,910 --> 02:28:56,710
Where did the baby go?

4066
02:28:57,250 --> 02:28:59,150
Where did the larvae come from?

4067
02:28:59,450 --> 02:28:59,770
What?

4068
02:29:01,190 --> 02:29:01,750
Oh!

4069
02:29:04,490 --> 02:29:05,390
Oh my god!

4070
02:29:05,750 --> 02:29:07,510
Cool guys don't look at explosions.

4071
02:29:08,090 --> 02:29:08,510
Yeah.

4072
02:29:08,850 --> 02:29:09,690
We're so cool.

4073
02:29:11,510 --> 02:29:12,510
We're so cool.

4074
02:29:12,630 --> 02:29:13,030
That's so cool.

4075
02:29:13,170 --> 02:29:14,530
That's so cool.

4076
02:29:14,830 --> 02:29:20,090
You see those TikTok videos where they put gasoline over a wasp hive?

4077
02:29:20,590 --> 02:29:21,770
That shit's so...

4078
02:29:21,770 --> 02:29:21,910
No.

4079
02:29:21,910 --> 02:29:22,990
We've never seen that TikTok!

4080
02:29:23,650 --> 02:29:24,910
There's like a pro tip...

4081
02:29:24,910 --> 02:29:26,390
I've seen a guy that vacuums wasps.

4082
02:29:26,390 --> 02:29:27,090
What the...

4083
02:29:27,250 --> 02:29:27,550
What the fuck?

4084
02:29:27,870 --> 02:29:29,610
I saw one where you get like a...

4085
02:29:29,610 --> 02:29:31,350
Like a bucket of gasoline.

4086
02:29:32,330 --> 02:29:34,850
And you put it on top of a wasp nest or whatever.

4087
02:29:35,090 --> 02:29:36,090
Like the wasp nest...

4088
02:29:36,090 --> 02:29:39,090
All the wasps in the wasp nest will just fall into it.

4089
02:29:39,150 --> 02:29:39,550
And die.

4090
02:29:39,870 --> 02:29:43,130
You are one of the noblest pollinators in nature.

4091
02:29:43,690 --> 02:29:44,990
I... I am?

4092
02:29:45,370 --> 02:29:46,090
Yeah, of course.

4093
02:29:46,350 --> 02:29:48,130
Bees pollinate crops that feed...

4094
02:29:48,130 --> 02:29:48,870
Dick Rider!

4095
02:29:50,550 --> 02:29:51,590
Dick Rider!

4096
02:29:55,330 --> 02:29:56,370
Dick Rider!

4097
02:30:11,350 --> 02:30:13,110
Dick Rider!

4098
02:30:13,130 --> 02:30:15,570
What the fuck?!

4099
02:30:15,570 --> 02:30:23,930
How did these bees fucking booty dodge all those bullets?esty

4100
02:30:36,630 --> 02:30:38,810
That fucking aim though.

4101
02:30:41,470 --> 02:30:44,030
Okay you're driving, I'm shooting.

4102
02:30:48,870 --> 02:30:50,530
Oh there's my underwear.

4103
02:30:51,930 --> 02:30:54,030
The little sweets, that's cute.

4104
02:30:56,930 --> 02:30:59,250
The fucking machine gun man.

4105
02:31:00,730 --> 02:31:01,870
Code not!

4106
02:31:03,490 --> 02:31:05,110
Oh no Alvin's angry.

4107
02:31:05,870 --> 02:31:06,890
Alvin's angry.

4108
02:31:07,230 --> 02:31:08,550
Don't worry I can fly.

4109
02:31:12,600 --> 02:31:14,180
What happens if I go...

4110
02:31:16,240 --> 02:31:16,920
Girl!

4111
02:31:33,070 --> 02:31:34,670
I didn't know.

4112
02:31:37,350 --> 02:31:38,070
Hello?

4113
02:31:38,970 --> 02:31:39,690
Hello?

4114
02:31:39,770 --> 02:31:40,450
I'm gonna go pee.

4115
02:31:40,730 --> 02:31:41,590
I'm gonna go pee.

4116
02:31:44,090 --> 02:31:44,930
I'm gonna go pee.

4117
02:31:44,990 --> 02:31:49,210
I didn't know that was gonna happen.

4118
02:31:50,690 --> 02:31:51,590
I didn't...

4119
02:31:53,050 --> 02:31:55,950
It was not intentional.

4120
02:31:56,470 --> 02:31:57,710
It was an accident.

4121
02:31:58,310 --> 02:31:59,590
I swear.

4122
02:31:59,590 --> 02:32:00,010
I swear.

4123
02:32:00,570 --> 02:32:03,690
It was just a little teehee accident.

4124
02:32:06,430 --> 02:32:09,330
You guys believe me right?

4125
02:32:11,890 --> 02:32:13,890
I didn't mean it.

4126
02:32:18,370 --> 02:32:19,650
I think...

4127
02:32:19,650 --> 02:32:23,550
Guys I think I'm doing really well chat.

4128
02:32:23,910 --> 02:32:25,630
I think I'm a great husband.

4129
02:32:25,930 --> 02:32:27,290
Don't you guys think so?

4130
02:32:27,590 --> 02:32:27,910
I...

4131
02:32:31,170 --> 02:32:34,770
Don't you guys think I'm an absolutely perfect husband?

4132
02:32:35,230 --> 02:32:35,350
Don't you guys think I'm an absolutely perfect husband?

4133
02:32:35,350 --> 02:32:35,870
Like...

4134
02:32:35,870 --> 02:32:39,570
The reason why we're getting a divorce is not because it was my fault.

4135
02:32:39,730 --> 02:32:43,130
I feel like clearly, I tried to...

4136
02:32:43,130 --> 02:32:50,830
I tried so hard to make it work I tried so hard to make it work And clearly, It wasn't a me issue for this.

4137
02:32:51,090 --> 02:32:51,690
Like...

4138
02:32:57,190 --> 02:32:57,790
Clearly...

4139
02:33:00,690 --> 02:33:01,670
Sure, see?

4140
02:33:02,010 --> 02:33:03,610
Father of the year!

4141
02:33:03,910 --> 02:33:05,450
Okay, I'm gonna make a pull.

4142
02:33:09,110 --> 02:33:12,690
Who's the reason for this?

4143
02:33:19,510 --> 02:33:24,770
All I'm saying is that I think I'm perfect husband material.

4144
02:33:29,220 --> 02:33:29,940
Okay.

4145
02:33:34,260 --> 02:33:38,900
All I'm saying is that I think I'm perfect husband material.

4146
02:33:40,260 --> 02:33:42,980
Like, anyone would want me as the husband.

4147
02:33:44,120 --> 02:33:46,520
I'm a perfect dad and a perfect husband.

4148
02:33:47,080 --> 02:33:48,020
There we go.

4149
02:33:49,140 --> 02:33:49,820
See?

4150
02:33:49,980 --> 02:33:50,720
No crashes!

4151
02:33:53,980 --> 02:33:55,340
No crashes.

4152
02:33:57,600 --> 02:33:59,540
Oh, I can rev!

4153
02:33:59,760 --> 02:34:00,440
I can rev!

4154
02:34:01,300 --> 02:34:02,180
I can rev!

4155
02:34:02,200 --> 02:34:02,600
I can go fast.

4156
02:34:03,460 --> 02:34:05,120
You guys gotta make sure you clear the way.

4157
02:34:07,260 --> 02:34:08,620
You guys gotta make sure.

4158
02:34:08,700 --> 02:34:09,640
Shoot the thing!

4159
02:34:09,740 --> 02:34:10,140
Shoot the thing!

4160
02:34:10,180 --> 02:34:10,560
Shoot the thing!

4161
02:34:12,500 --> 02:34:13,320
Okay, here we go.

4162
02:34:13,400 --> 02:34:13,560
We're good.

4163
02:34:13,720 --> 02:34:13,800
We're good.

4164
02:34:16,200 --> 02:34:16,580
Puppet!

4165
02:34:16,920 --> 02:34:17,740
I'm trying!

4166
02:34:18,640 --> 02:34:19,300
There's a cooldown!

4167
02:34:19,640 --> 02:34:20,460
There's a cooldown!

4168
02:34:20,660 --> 02:34:22,640
I can't just pump whenever you tell me to pump!

4169
02:34:23,680 --> 02:34:25,260
Well, you're gonna have to pump it here!

4170
02:34:27,700 --> 02:34:28,080
Threatenita!

4171
02:34:32,080 --> 02:34:32,720
Woah!

4172
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:33,980
My god!

4173
02:34:34,100 --> 02:34:35,240
Squirrel gliders!

4174
02:34:35,880 --> 02:34:37,300
Shoot down the squirrels!

4175
02:34:37,320 --> 02:34:38,800
They're not people anyway!

4176
02:34:40,980 --> 02:34:41,740
That's fucked up!

4177
02:34:43,940 --> 02:34:45,780
They shot us first!

4178
02:34:45,940 --> 02:34:46,660
They shot first.

4179
02:34:48,520 --> 02:34:49,720
They shot first.

4180
02:34:50,960 --> 02:34:52,780
Why am I taking damage?

4181
02:34:53,080 --> 02:34:54,180
Why am I...

4182
02:34:55,060 --> 02:34:57,260
Because they're shooting, you stupid bitch!

4183
02:34:57,900 --> 02:35:01,180
Yeah, but if you killed them before then, I wouldn't get shot.

4184
02:35:01,180 --> 02:35:02,840
That's why I'm swapping to mouse and keyboard.

4185
02:35:06,180 --> 02:35:07,080
It's worse!

4186
02:35:07,240 --> 02:35:08,120
It's worse somehow!

4187
02:35:09,660 --> 02:35:11,400
The DPI is so low!

4188
02:35:11,960 --> 02:35:13,640
That fucking changed your DPI!

4189
02:35:16,360 --> 02:35:17,900
I can't be ashamed!

4190
02:35:20,180 --> 02:35:20,840
Don't worry.

4191
02:35:20,960 --> 02:35:21,260
Don't worry.

4192
02:35:22,020 --> 02:35:26,500
Because the talented controller input can do this.

4193
02:35:28,260 --> 02:35:29,680
That's why you need me.

4194
02:35:29,760 --> 02:35:30,220
We got more trouble ahead!

4195
02:35:30,220 --> 02:35:31,780
I'm gifted in any input.

4196
02:35:33,980 --> 02:35:34,500
Woah!

4197
02:35:34,760 --> 02:35:34,980
Woah!

4198
02:35:35,100 --> 02:35:35,520
Woah!

4199
02:35:35,540 --> 02:35:36,060
Woah!

4200
02:35:36,300 --> 02:35:36,540
Woah!

4201
02:35:36,840 --> 02:35:36,860
Woah!

4202
02:35:36,940 --> 02:35:37,720
Pick one!

4203
02:35:37,820 --> 02:35:38,220
Pick one!

4204
02:35:38,260 --> 02:35:38,700
Pick one!

4205
02:35:38,700 --> 02:35:39,120
Pick one!

4206
02:35:39,140 --> 02:35:39,480
Pick one!

4207
02:35:39,960 --> 02:35:42,860
I destroyed all three, so...

4208
02:35:42,860 --> 02:35:45,220
Okay, I couldn't tell because they were still there.

4209
02:35:46,360 --> 02:35:47,760
There's something behind us?

4210
02:35:48,360 --> 02:35:50,040
There's fucking things behind us!

4211
02:35:50,260 --> 02:35:51,100
They're so fucking slow!

4212
02:35:51,760 --> 02:35:52,520
Oh god.

4213
02:35:52,940 --> 02:35:53,900
Oh god.

4214
02:35:54,160 --> 02:35:55,720
I hope you're shooting them.

4215
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,320
There's still planes behind us, by the way!

4216
02:35:58,320 --> 02:36:00,300
It's escalating quickly!

4217
02:36:00,660 --> 02:36:00,920
What?

4218
02:36:01,080 --> 02:36:02,740
There's some things behind us!

4219
02:36:02,740 --> 02:36:04,020
They're slowly occurring!

4220
02:36:06,740 --> 02:36:08,520
That's a U problem!

4221
02:36:11,220 --> 02:36:12,460
Oh god.

4222
02:36:12,560 --> 02:36:13,180
Oh god.

4223
02:36:14,840 --> 02:36:16,320
Why did you pause?

4224
02:36:16,720 --> 02:36:22,200
I didn't get the pause button!

4225
02:36:22,200 --> 02:36:22,840
Why is it...

4226
02:36:26,240 --> 02:36:28,040
Is it better now?

4227
02:36:29,100 --> 02:36:31,360
No, I still haven't fixed my DPI.

4228
02:36:32,740 --> 02:36:35,080
I have to aim with my arm instead of my wrist.

4229
02:36:35,740 --> 02:36:37,040
It's okay, we're out.

4230
02:36:37,280 --> 02:36:37,600
We're out.

4231
02:36:37,840 --> 02:36:37,980
I think it's over.

4232
02:36:39,700 --> 02:36:42,620
Are you gonna fight the squirrel?!

4233
02:36:43,340 --> 02:36:44,480
Oh my god, its Alvin.

4234
02:36:48,360 --> 02:36:49,400
Oh shit!

4235
02:36:49,400 --> 02:36:49,680
Shit!

4236
02:36:50,900 --> 02:36:52,600
Oh my god, fight, fight!

4237
02:36:52,700 --> 02:36:53,720
What am I supposed to do?

4238
02:36:53,860 --> 02:36:54,620
Am I just...

4239
02:36:54,620 --> 02:36:56,080
Oh, I'm just gonna make sure.

4240
02:36:56,220 --> 02:36:57,780
This is a fighting game now.

4241
02:36:57,860 --> 02:36:58,580
What the fuck?

4242
02:36:58,680 --> 02:36:59,980
It's time for Tekken!

4243
02:37:02,700 --> 02:37:03,780
Beat him up!

4244
02:37:03,920 --> 02:37:04,500
Beat him up!

4245
02:37:07,040 --> 02:37:07,880
Kick his ass!

4246
02:37:09,100 --> 02:37:10,560
Oh my god, he's not doing it!

4247
02:37:11,020 --> 02:37:11,800
He's talking!

4248
02:37:14,640 --> 02:37:16,360
He went super fast!

4249
02:37:19,460 --> 02:37:20,580
Oh shit!

4250
02:37:20,960 --> 02:37:24,540
Oh my god, KO!

4251
02:37:26,820 --> 02:37:28,020
What the fuck?

4252
02:37:29,600 --> 02:37:31,460
Oh, that squirrel is dead dead.

4253
02:37:31,720 --> 02:37:32,600
There is no way.

4254
02:37:39,840 --> 02:37:40,400
Wow!

4255
02:37:40,400 --> 02:37:41,960
I do love you!

4256
02:37:42,380 --> 02:37:43,240
Oh my god.

4257
02:37:43,520 --> 02:37:45,020
Oh, we have to balance this.

4258
02:37:45,160 --> 02:37:45,460
Yeah.

4259
02:37:46,280 --> 02:37:48,220
Yeah, we have to be fully balanced!

4260
02:37:48,340 --> 02:37:49,480
What are you doing?!

4261
02:37:50,660 --> 02:37:52,400
Okay, I'll be right side!

4262
02:37:52,480 --> 02:37:53,080
I'll be right side!

4263
02:37:55,460 --> 02:37:56,000
Okay.

4264
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:56,580
I should have been left.

4265
02:37:56,600 --> 02:37:56,680
I was left.

4266
02:37:56,980 --> 02:37:58,300
You should have gone left.

4267
02:38:00,020 --> 02:38:01,120
What do you mean?

4268
02:38:01,320 --> 02:38:04,620
When we're my... Okay, I'll stay... When we're balanced, I'll be left.

4269
02:38:04,980 --> 02:38:05,520
Okay?

4270
02:38:05,940 --> 02:38:07,080
When we're balanced.

4271
02:38:07,400 --> 02:38:07,940
Okay.

4272
02:38:07,940 --> 02:38:08,240
Alright?

4273
02:38:08,900 --> 02:38:09,440
Okay.

4274
02:38:10,100 --> 02:38:11,600
Okay, okay, okay.

4275
02:38:11,900 --> 02:38:12,820
Mm-mm, alright.

4276
02:38:13,500 --> 02:38:14,660
We're gonna be good sometime.

4277
02:38:17,190 --> 02:38:21,000
All I'm saying is that I stay on the left side.

4278
02:38:21,400 --> 02:38:23,060
I know where my place is.

4279
02:38:23,940 --> 02:38:24,340
Okay.

4280
02:38:25,860 --> 02:38:26,700
Look at that.

4281
02:38:30,630 --> 02:38:31,410
Yeah, Gumi?

4282
02:38:32,690 --> 02:38:33,170
Yeah?

4283
02:38:33,410 --> 02:38:34,770
I like to go to the left side too.

4284
02:38:37,210 --> 02:38:38,950
Why don't we just stay in the center?

4285
02:38:40,370 --> 02:38:42,070
We don't wanna go anywhere.

4286
02:38:42,170 --> 02:38:43,290
We stay in the center.

4287
02:38:43,790 --> 02:38:44,230
Okay.

4288
02:38:44,550 --> 02:38:47,110
I think that's just easier for us.

4289
02:38:47,330 --> 02:38:47,550
Wow, wait.

4290
02:38:47,730 --> 02:38:48,690
Look at what happened.

4291
02:38:51,270 --> 02:38:53,970
Maybe... we just have to stay in the center.

4292
02:38:54,490 --> 02:38:56,930
How about you stay in the center and I steer?

4293
02:38:57,690 --> 02:38:59,090
Maybe that's just better.

4294
02:38:59,250 --> 02:38:59,390
Yeah.

4295
02:38:59,690 --> 02:39:01,370
Okay, but I'm getting scared.

4296
02:39:01,570 --> 02:39:02,330
I'm getting scared.

4297
02:39:02,330 --> 02:39:03,770
Maybe there's just too many cooks in the kitchen.

4298
02:39:04,230 --> 02:39:04,810
You know?

4299
02:39:05,230 --> 02:39:06,530
Too many cooks.

4300
02:39:07,110 --> 02:39:09,390
We don't want too many cooks in the kitchen.

4301
02:39:10,690 --> 02:39:11,570
You're scaring...

4302
02:39:11,570 --> 02:39:12,830
What am I doing?

4303
02:39:12,950 --> 02:39:14,010
What am I doing?

4304
02:39:14,070 --> 02:39:16,690
I am doing everything I can to save this marriage.

4305
02:39:18,110 --> 02:39:18,550
Yeah?

4306
02:39:20,170 --> 02:39:21,050
Okay, here we go.

4307
02:39:21,270 --> 02:39:23,510
Well, they shouldn't have stolen from us in the last episode.

4308
02:39:23,510 --> 02:39:24,010
Alright, nice.

4309
02:39:25,210 --> 02:39:26,410
I think we should go right.

4310
02:39:26,510 --> 02:39:27,290
I think we should go right.

4311
02:39:27,370 --> 02:39:28,430
I think... and then we should go left.

4312
02:39:28,530 --> 02:39:28,970
We should go left.

4313
02:39:29,010 --> 02:39:29,450
We should go left.

4314
02:39:29,510 --> 02:39:29,910
We should go left.

4315
02:39:30,010 --> 02:39:30,250
No!

4316
02:39:32,690 --> 02:39:35,530
Please, not the beginning.

4317
02:39:35,830 --> 02:39:36,910
Oh, thank God.

4318
02:39:37,450 --> 02:39:38,470
We're not the beginning.

4319
02:39:39,090 --> 02:39:41,310
You think the squirrels will be mad about the plane?

4320
02:39:41,850 --> 02:39:42,590
We'll be fine.

4321
02:39:42,750 --> 02:39:44,310
They shouldn't have stolen from us in the last episode.

4322
02:39:44,310 --> 02:39:44,950
We'll be fine.

4323
02:39:46,070 --> 02:39:48,210
I'll never look at a squirrel the same way again.

4324
02:39:49,930 --> 02:39:50,270
Um...

4325
02:39:50,270 --> 02:39:50,310
Um...

4326
02:39:51,530 --> 02:39:51,870
No!

4327
02:39:56,730 --> 02:39:58,550
Gooby, we can make it through, right?

4328
02:39:58,630 --> 02:39:59,850
Maybe we stay in the center?

4329
02:40:00,230 --> 02:40:02,170
We think the squirrels will be mad about the plane?

4330
02:40:02,490 --> 02:40:03,150
Don't worry.

4331
02:40:03,330 --> 02:40:05,490
Well, they shouldn't have stolen from us in the past episode!

4332
02:40:05,750 --> 02:40:06,990
Maybe... Maybe...

4333
02:40:06,990 --> 02:40:09,130
I'll never look at a squirrel the same way again!

4334
02:40:09,810 --> 02:40:10,170
What?

4335
02:40:10,510 --> 02:40:10,810
Oh!

4336
02:40:10,830 --> 02:40:11,510
Oh, it still works.

4337
02:40:11,590 --> 02:40:11,910
It still works.

4338
02:40:12,050 --> 02:40:12,330
Left!

4339
02:40:12,430 --> 02:40:12,630
Left!

4340
02:40:12,650 --> 02:40:12,810
Left!

4341
02:40:12,810 --> 02:40:13,070
Left!

4342
02:40:13,150 --> 02:40:13,310
Left!

4343
02:40:13,310 --> 02:40:13,550
Left!

4344
02:40:13,550 --> 02:40:13,690
Left!

4345
02:40:13,750 --> 02:40:13,810
Left!

4346
02:40:13,910 --> 02:40:13,910
Left!

4347
02:40:13,990 --> 02:40:13,990
Left!

4348
02:40:13,990 --> 02:40:14,150
Left!

4349
02:40:14,150 --> 02:40:14,230
Left!

4350
02:40:14,230 --> 02:40:14,230
Left!

4351
02:40:14,230 --> 02:40:14,230
Left!

4352
02:40:14,230 --> 02:40:14,230
Left!

4353
02:40:14,230 --> 02:40:14,290
Left!

4354
02:40:14,550 --> 02:40:14,590
Left!

4355
02:40:14,590 --> 02:40:14,590
Left!

4356
02:40:14,590 --> 02:40:14,590
Left!

4357
02:40:14,910 --> 02:40:15,250
Left!

4358
02:40:15,250 --> 02:40:15,270
Nice.

4359
02:40:15,510 --> 02:40:15,630
Nice.

4360
02:40:15,630 --> 02:40:15,750
Nice.

4361
02:40:15,750 --> 02:40:15,870
Nice.

4362
02:40:15,870 --> 02:40:16,010
Nice.

4363
02:40:16,010 --> 02:40:16,350
Right.

4364
02:40:16,550 --> 02:40:16,670
Right.

4365
02:40:16,670 --> 02:40:16,810
Right.

4366
02:40:16,810 --> 02:40:16,950
Right.

4367
02:40:16,950 --> 02:40:17,050
Right.

4368
02:40:17,130 --> 02:40:17,230
Right.

4369
02:40:17,290 --> 02:40:17,650
Center.

4370
02:40:17,850 --> 02:40:18,190
Center.

4371
02:40:18,190 --> 02:40:18,510
Center.

4372
02:40:18,550 --> 02:40:18,910
Center.

4373
02:40:18,970 --> 02:40:19,090
Center.

4374
02:40:20,530 --> 02:40:21,510
He didn't do that.

4375
02:40:21,750 --> 02:40:22,710
Apex callouts!

4376
02:40:22,830 --> 02:40:23,390
He's won!

4377
02:40:23,390 --> 02:40:23,870
He's one!

4378
02:40:23,910 --> 02:40:24,310
He's one!

4379
02:40:24,510 --> 02:40:25,370
He's one!

4380
02:40:25,870 --> 02:40:28,190
He has a purple armor seal!

4381
02:40:28,450 --> 02:40:28,770
Crack!

4382
02:40:28,830 --> 02:40:29,190
Crack!

4383
02:40:29,390 --> 02:40:29,530
Crack!

4384
02:40:29,610 --> 02:40:29,830
Crack!

4385
02:40:29,850 --> 02:40:30,010
Crack!

4386
02:40:30,070 --> 02:40:30,230
Crack!

4387
02:40:30,310 --> 02:40:30,430
Crack!

4388
02:40:33,410 --> 02:40:34,130
I'm shielding!

4389
02:40:34,470 --> 02:40:34,830
Shielding!

4390
02:40:35,810 --> 02:40:36,350
Cover me!

4391
02:40:36,390 --> 02:40:36,710
Cover me!

4392
02:40:36,790 --> 02:40:37,370
I'm reloading.

4393
02:40:41,390 --> 02:40:42,210
Where's Rose's room?

4394
02:40:42,970 --> 02:40:43,610
Where is that?

4395
02:40:43,790 --> 02:40:43,970
Oh!

4396
02:40:43,970 --> 02:40:44,350
Is there?

4397
02:40:44,570 --> 02:40:44,810
Oh!

4398
02:40:44,810 --> 02:40:45,090
Shit!

4399
02:40:45,110 --> 02:40:46,790
I was like, where the fuck are we supposed to go?

4400
02:40:46,990 --> 02:40:47,290
Right!

4401
02:40:47,450 --> 02:40:47,530
Right!

4402
02:40:47,610 --> 02:40:47,770
Right!

4403
02:40:47,810 --> 02:40:48,010
Right!

4404
02:40:48,070 --> 02:40:48,270
Right!

4405
02:40:48,270 --> 02:40:49,830
I'm not gonna wait!

4406
02:40:50,890 --> 02:40:51,350
Okay.

4407
02:40:52,570 --> 02:40:53,390
Alright, we're good.

4408
02:40:53,430 --> 02:40:53,590
See?

4409
02:40:54,090 --> 02:40:54,550
Nice.

4410
02:40:55,070 --> 02:40:55,890
We did it.

4411
02:40:59,410 --> 02:41:00,430
That's you sleeping.

4412
02:41:01,370 --> 02:41:02,570
Sleeping on the job.

4413
02:41:03,710 --> 02:41:05,090
Oh my gosh, she's gonna talk to me.

4414
02:41:05,130 --> 02:41:05,590
She's like, Mom?

4415
02:41:06,110 --> 02:41:08,050
Hey, do you remember Mr. Baboon?

4416
02:41:12,750 --> 02:41:13,530
Mom's sleeping!

4417
02:41:14,130 --> 02:41:15,890
This is mom's sleeping hour.

4418
02:41:20,560 --> 02:41:21,440
I'm sleeping!

4419
02:41:25,980 --> 02:41:28,860
Dude, she's about to run away from home at this point.

4420
02:41:28,940 --> 02:41:31,380
Yeah, she's gonna fucking inside out it.

4421
02:41:34,900 --> 02:41:35,900
Oh my god.

4422
02:41:39,520 --> 02:41:40,000
Damn.

4423
02:41:41,520 --> 02:41:43,740
Mommy has two jobs, leave her alone.

4424
02:41:45,680 --> 02:41:46,940
Yeah, you talk to dad?

4425
02:41:48,260 --> 02:41:49,060
Bro, what?

4426
02:41:49,080 --> 02:41:49,720
That's his life.

4427
02:41:49,720 --> 02:41:50,060
You're lying?

4428
02:41:50,300 --> 02:41:51,200
You're making shit up.

4429
02:41:51,860 --> 02:41:53,220
I just want you to know.

4430
02:41:56,440 --> 02:42:00,500
Someone's like, I think we need to call CPS on them.

4431
02:42:03,420 --> 02:42:05,220
We're not terrible parents!

4432
02:42:05,600 --> 02:42:07,340
We have to make all of them.

4433
02:42:07,360 --> 02:42:10,680
We are tired from making so much money for our kid.

4434
02:42:11,460 --> 02:42:12,920
Our kid has to fucking...

4435
02:42:12,920 --> 02:42:15,880
Dude, just because I'm fucking napping doesn't mean you have to call CPS.

4436
02:42:16,580 --> 02:42:17,080
Yeah!

4437
02:42:17,500 --> 02:42:18,000
Wow!

4438
02:42:22,320 --> 02:42:23,620
Look at her room!

4439
02:42:24,020 --> 02:42:25,380
Look at her room!

4440
02:42:25,500 --> 02:42:26,680
Tell us we're not providing!

4441
02:42:26,700 --> 02:42:26,720
I'm providing!

4442
02:42:29,360 --> 02:42:32,020
She has a TV in her own fucking room.

4443
02:42:32,180 --> 02:42:32,960
Like, what the fuck?

4444
02:42:34,720 --> 02:42:35,160
I'm

4445
02:42:43,530 --> 02:42:45,330
flying by the seat of your pants!

4446
02:42:45,630 --> 02:42:46,150
Oh, haha.

4447
02:42:46,430 --> 02:42:48,090
You're real comedic, you know that?

4448
02:42:48,270 --> 02:42:49,030
Thank you.

4449
02:42:49,910 --> 02:42:50,950
Look, there she is.

4450
02:42:51,150 --> 02:42:52,210
Oh, I miss her.

4451
02:42:52,730 --> 02:42:53,550
Do you think she's okay?

4452
02:42:54,150 --> 02:42:55,210
She looks fine.

4453
02:42:55,270 --> 02:42:57,070
I mean, she's playing like nothing happened.

4454
02:42:57,070 --> 02:42:57,490
Yeah, see?

4455
02:42:57,630 --> 02:42:58,070
She's playing like nothing happened.

4456
02:42:58,070 --> 02:42:58,070
Yeah, see?

4457
02:42:58,070 --> 02:42:58,070
She's playing like nothing happened.

4458
02:42:58,090 --> 02:42:59,350
She looks like she's happy.

4459
02:43:00,190 --> 02:43:02,530
Just like me when I had to play in my room.

4460
02:43:02,630 --> 02:43:04,630
Just like me when I had to play in my room.

4461
02:43:04,950 --> 02:43:06,090
She's not disassociating.

4462
02:43:07,470 --> 02:43:07,770
She's not disassociating.

4463
02:43:08,150 --> 02:43:10,570
We've turned into a couple of dolls, remember?

4464
02:43:10,790 --> 02:43:11,630
Of course I remember.

4465
02:43:12,570 --> 02:43:13,050
Whoa!

4466
02:43:13,310 --> 02:43:13,650
Oh!

4467
02:43:14,010 --> 02:43:15,230
Are you ready to talk to Rose?

4468
02:43:15,250 --> 02:43:15,830
Why not?

4469
02:43:15,850 --> 02:43:16,790
She's our daughter.

4470
02:43:17,030 --> 02:43:19,910
Well, can you talk to her without fighting each other?

4471
02:43:20,050 --> 02:43:20,770
Of course we can.

4472
02:43:20,770 --> 02:43:23,450
Of course we're like... one minute is all we need.

4473
02:43:24,470 --> 02:43:25,230
You see?

4474
02:43:25,230 --> 02:43:27,270
I don't think you are ready!

4475
02:43:27,490 --> 02:43:29,010
Wait, is he trying to stop us?

4476
02:43:29,230 --> 02:43:30,270
I think that he is.

4477
02:43:30,370 --> 02:43:31,890
And are we gonna let him?

4478
02:43:32,370 --> 02:43:32,570
I think that he is.

4479
02:43:32,570 --> 02:43:32,570
And are we gonna let him?

4480
02:43:32,570 --> 02:43:32,610
No!

4481
02:43:33,670 --> 02:43:34,150
Yeah!

4482
02:43:36,310 --> 02:43:38,570
Finally, we don't have to listen to this guy.

4483
02:43:38,910 --> 02:43:38,930
Finally, we don't have to listen to this guy.

4484
02:43:41,350 --> 02:43:41,830
Wait.

4485
02:43:41,830 --> 02:43:43,650
What if we can't make Rose cry?

4486
02:43:44,010 --> 02:43:44,250
Wait.

4487
02:43:44,290 --> 02:43:44,770
What if we can't make Rose cry?

4488
02:43:44,770 --> 02:43:45,410
We have to.

4489
02:43:45,650 --> 02:43:47,270
We'll be stuck like this for a while.

4490
02:43:47,270 --> 02:43:49,590
We're gonna make our child cry.

4491
02:43:50,210 --> 02:43:50,310
We're gonna make our child cry.

4492
02:43:51,850 --> 02:43:53,370
What the fuck is...

4493
02:43:53,370 --> 02:43:54,690
We got a sniper on us.

4494
02:43:54,890 --> 02:43:54,910
We got a sniper on us.

4495
02:43:55,950 --> 02:43:57,650
We have a creep on us.

4496
02:43:57,770 --> 02:43:59,530
Dude, they're breathing so heavily!

4497
02:44:00,770 --> 02:44:01,370
Oh!

4498
02:44:01,430 --> 02:44:01,850
Oh!

4499
02:44:01,890 --> 02:44:02,230
Oh!

4500
02:44:02,270 --> 02:44:02,650
Oh!

4501
02:44:02,970 --> 02:44:03,570
Oh!

4502
02:44:03,610 --> 02:44:04,210
Oh!

4503
02:44:07,250 --> 02:44:08,590
There's a lot of pillows.

4504
02:44:09,050 --> 02:44:10,590
A dream catcher?

4505
02:44:11,490 --> 02:44:12,090
Oh!

4506
02:44:12,090 --> 02:44:13,470
There's like a pillow for it.

4507
02:44:13,470 --> 02:44:13,630
Yeah.

4508
02:44:14,350 --> 02:44:16,590
Yeah, well, you haven't played here lately.

4509
02:44:16,810 --> 02:44:18,070
Hank Brothers?

4510
02:44:18,510 --> 02:44:19,110
Oh!

4511
02:44:19,910 --> 02:44:21,390
Rose calls it mommy space.

4512
02:44:21,930 --> 02:44:23,390
The mommy space.

4513
02:44:23,510 --> 02:44:25,130
Aw, she has mommy-ish.

4514
02:44:25,230 --> 02:44:26,830
She has mommy-ish shoes.

4515
02:44:26,830 --> 02:44:27,330
Don't we all?

4516
02:44:28,150 --> 02:44:29,290
Alright, let's see.

4517
02:44:29,970 --> 02:44:30,910
How do we do this?

4518
02:44:31,310 --> 02:44:31,910
Oh, yeah!

4519
02:44:33,690 --> 02:44:34,810
The tank one!

4520
02:44:37,170 --> 02:44:38,250
Wait, how do I...

4521
02:44:38,250 --> 02:44:38,530
Oh!

4522
02:44:39,290 --> 02:44:40,670
I figured it out!

4523
02:44:43,170 --> 02:44:44,130
Why are you getting closer?

4524
02:44:44,270 --> 02:44:45,170
Why are you getting closer?

4525
02:44:46,070 --> 02:44:48,990
I don't like how close you are.

4526
02:44:52,970 --> 02:44:54,330
You're in the corner.

4527
02:44:56,790 --> 02:44:58,050
We hit each other.

4528
02:44:59,070 --> 02:45:00,490
I just need that one hit.

4529
02:45:00,570 --> 02:45:01,650
I just need that one hit.

4530
02:45:01,750 --> 02:45:02,850
I just need that one hit.

4531
02:45:03,010 --> 02:45:03,790
And then we're good.

4532
02:45:07,130 --> 02:45:07,810
Wait, where did...

4533
02:45:07,810 --> 02:45:08,270
Yes!

4534
02:45:09,370 --> 02:45:09,810
Yes!

4535
02:45:10,630 --> 02:45:12,990
I would have hit a save a little second earlier!

4536
02:45:13,530 --> 02:45:14,630
I'm a gamer.

4537
02:45:15,450 --> 02:45:16,470
I'm a gamer.

4538
02:45:17,110 --> 02:45:19,050
Wait, it says I'm two and you're one.

4539
02:45:19,430 --> 02:45:22,390
No, it says that I'm four and you're one.

4540
02:45:22,910 --> 02:45:24,370
Well, it says two and one for me.

4541
02:45:24,630 --> 02:45:25,950
It says four and one for me.

4542
02:45:26,230 --> 02:45:27,150
I love stars!

4543
02:45:28,230 --> 02:45:29,190
This is my way.

4544
02:45:29,290 --> 02:45:29,830
What the fuck?

4545
02:45:29,870 --> 02:45:30,670
This is my way.

4546
02:45:33,170 --> 02:45:33,710
That's right.

4547
02:45:33,730 --> 02:45:34,690
Get distracted by that.

4548
02:45:34,750 --> 02:45:35,730
I get a head start now.

4549
02:45:36,430 --> 02:45:37,310
Wait, what is this?

4550
02:45:37,710 --> 02:45:38,770
What's a flashlight for?

4551
02:45:38,950 --> 02:45:40,510
Maybe flashlight on is better.

4552
02:45:42,310 --> 02:45:43,410
Does it really matter?

4553
02:45:43,710 --> 02:45:44,710
Why is there a car truck?

4554
02:45:45,490 --> 02:45:46,450
Wait, there's something in the car.

4555
02:45:46,470 --> 02:45:46,710
What's happening here?

4556
02:45:49,310 --> 02:45:49,950
What is this?

4557
02:45:49,990 --> 02:45:50,710
Is this an Easter egg?

4558
02:45:53,890 --> 02:45:55,410
Oh, it's the brothers!

4559
02:45:57,470 --> 02:45:58,390
It's the brothers!

4560
02:46:00,390 --> 02:46:02,790
There's an Easter egg from their other game that they made.

4561
02:46:03,290 --> 02:46:03,970
It's the...

4562
02:46:03,970 --> 02:46:04,870
I've never played that game.

4563
02:46:05,090 --> 02:46:05,450
Me too.

4564
02:46:05,590 --> 02:46:06,470
I've never played it either.

4565
02:46:06,690 --> 02:46:08,410
But it's like the streamer game.

4566
02:46:08,610 --> 02:46:12,970
It's like if you want to play a co-op or something, it's either this or the other one.

4567
02:46:13,650 --> 02:46:15,030
Alright, let's play the other one next.

4568
02:46:16,470 --> 02:46:16,550
What's this?

4569
02:46:18,690 --> 02:46:21,050
Oh, it's just like Easter eggs.

4570
02:46:27,260 --> 02:46:28,140
Wait, what?

4571
02:46:29,920 --> 02:46:32,340
Wait, what?

4572
02:46:32,340 --> 02:46:34,000
Wait, what?

4573
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:35,020
Enter password?

4574
02:46:35,240 --> 02:46:35,600
Enter password?

4575
02:46:40,460 --> 02:46:41,100
Hacking?

4576
02:46:41,420 --> 02:46:41,580
Hacking?

4577
02:46:42,580 --> 02:46:43,520
Like this?

4578
02:46:47,890 --> 02:46:49,490
Oh, you're on the other side.

4579
02:46:49,570 --> 02:46:50,530
Oh, alright.

4580
02:46:50,550 --> 02:46:51,110
Oh.

4581
02:46:52,290 --> 02:46:53,190
Oh!

4582
02:46:54,420 --> 02:46:56,450
But what do we do here?

4583
02:46:57,290 --> 02:46:58,490
I'm green?

4584
02:46:58,830 --> 02:46:59,970
I am red.

4585
02:47:05,900 --> 02:47:07,660
I think... are we stupid?

4586
02:47:09,380 --> 02:47:10,800
Are we...

4587
02:47:10,800 --> 02:47:11,720
Look at that!

4588
02:47:12,420 --> 02:47:13,160
Oh!

4589
02:47:14,620 --> 02:47:15,320
Whoa!

4590
02:47:18,900 --> 02:47:19,940
It's okay.

4591
02:47:20,510 --> 02:47:22,180
We're figuring it out.

4592
02:47:22,180 --> 02:47:24,220
We're figuring it out.

4593
02:47:24,240 --> 02:47:24,540
No, no.

4594
02:47:24,580 --> 02:47:26,240
We have to make this guy angry.

4595
02:47:26,500 --> 02:47:27,020
Right?

4596
02:47:27,320 --> 02:47:28,480
You make him smile!

4597
02:47:28,600 --> 02:47:31,660
I thought it was eyelashes.

4598
02:47:33,300 --> 02:47:34,060
Oh, why?

4599
02:47:34,580 --> 02:47:35,120
Why?

4600
02:47:35,180 --> 02:47:35,520
Why?

4601
02:47:36,020 --> 02:47:36,620
Look,

4602
02:47:42,560 --> 02:47:44,340
I thought they were eyelashes.

4603
02:47:44,760 --> 02:47:45,340
Okay?

4604
02:47:45,420 --> 02:47:47,020
I thought they were eyelashes.

4605
02:47:47,740 --> 02:47:48,520
Uh-huh.

4606
02:47:50,840 --> 02:47:51,440
Whoa!

4607
02:47:51,880 --> 02:47:52,060
Oh!

4608
02:47:56,610 --> 02:47:59,040
Because I brought you in the Space Museum!

4609
02:47:59,560 --> 02:48:00,220
Liar!

4610
02:48:00,780 --> 02:48:05,900
Rose had picked me at the Space Museum and commissioned me for a special mission.

4611
02:48:06,200 --> 02:48:11,580
I am the only one who can protect Rose from the dark side of the universe!

4612
02:48:11,800 --> 02:48:15,480
Well, we're also assigned to protect Rose as her parents...

4613
02:48:15,480 --> 02:48:17,240
Stop lying!

4614
02:48:17,500 --> 02:48:20,140
Your mission is to make her cry!

4615
02:48:20,540 --> 02:48:20,980
Damn!

4616
02:48:21,020 --> 02:48:22,880
That's a fucked up mission.

4617
02:48:25,060 --> 02:48:26,920
The bigger the better.

4618
02:48:28,160 --> 02:48:31,140
They can be happy tears, Moonbaboon!

4619
02:48:32,100 --> 02:48:34,020
People can cry out of happiness!

4620
02:48:35,440 --> 02:48:37,580
Take him out, Spacebaboon!

4621
02:48:40,760 --> 02:48:42,640
Dude, Spacebaboon is CPS.

4622
02:48:44,500 --> 02:48:45,120
Eww!

4623
02:48:45,220 --> 02:48:46,980
Who caught CPS on us?

4624
02:48:48,460 --> 02:48:49,600
Who was it?

4625
02:48:52,880 --> 02:48:53,680
I'm having a panic attack.

4626
02:48:54,140 --> 02:48:55,100
What should we do?

4627
02:48:56,700 --> 02:49:00,220
It Takes Two has the most accurate portrayal of panic attacks.

4628
02:49:01,080 --> 02:49:03,560
Have you seen that meme where people were like...

4629
02:49:03,560 --> 02:49:07,720
were like talking about which movies had the best portrayal...

4630
02:49:07,720 --> 02:49:10,720
which animated movies had the best portrayal of panic attacks?

4631
02:49:11,500 --> 02:49:12,980
Did you see that?

4632
02:49:13,020 --> 02:49:15,220
I've seen people say... you know that movie...

4633
02:49:16,160 --> 02:49:19,060
the Pixar movie with the motions or whatever?

4634
02:49:19,480 --> 02:49:20,440
Yeah, Inside Out.

4635
02:49:20,460 --> 02:49:20,620
Yeah.

4636
02:49:21,220 --> 02:49:22,560
Yeah, I've heard people say...

4637
02:49:22,880 --> 02:49:24,100
that anxiety looks fuckable or...

4638
02:49:24,880 --> 02:49:25,240
What?!

4639
02:49:25,240 --> 02:49:27,260
It works!

4640
02:49:28,260 --> 02:49:28,940
Inflation!

4641
02:49:29,660 --> 02:49:30,540
Cosmic inflation!

4642
02:49:31,560 --> 02:49:33,280
Oh my god, inflation!

4643
02:49:34,660 --> 02:49:36,400
If you wanna know...

4644
02:49:36,400 --> 02:49:39,440
Wait, what does anxiety look like from Inside Out?

4645
02:49:39,920 --> 02:49:42,440
Basically, she looks like the...

4646
02:49:42,440 --> 02:49:43,740
Cosmic inflation!

4647
02:49:43,800 --> 02:49:45,060
She's like the orange one.

4648
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:48,120
Do you know they release the new emotions?

4649
02:49:48,480 --> 02:49:50,360
It's like anxiety, envy...

4650
02:49:50,360 --> 02:49:52,860
Dude, anxiety does not look fuckable!

4651
02:49:52,880 --> 02:49:56,220
It's like anxiety, envy, boredom...

4652
02:49:56,220 --> 02:49:57,660
and I don't remember the fourth one.

4653
02:49:58,060 --> 02:49:58,180
Woo!

4654
02:49:58,680 --> 02:49:59,120
Haha!

4655
02:49:59,600 --> 02:50:01,500
How come you get all the cool gadgets?

4656
02:50:01,900 --> 02:50:03,180
Because I'm cooler than you, Cody.

4657
02:50:03,480 --> 02:50:04,900
Yeah, how come you get the cool one?

4658
02:50:05,100 --> 02:50:07,180
I forgot what the fourth emotion they introduced.

4659
02:50:07,460 --> 02:50:08,840
Let's find a way out of here.

4660
02:50:09,240 --> 02:50:09,680
Bro.

4661
02:50:09,960 --> 02:50:12,440
Can you not buy Rose, you cruiser space monkey, please?

4662
02:50:12,820 --> 02:50:14,700
Well, she was the one who picked him out.

4663
02:50:15,060 --> 02:50:17,120
Yeah, and you paid for him.

4664
02:50:17,280 --> 02:50:18,100
What do I do?

4665
02:50:18,420 --> 02:50:18,820
It's terrifying.

4666
02:50:19,260 --> 02:50:20,400
Oh, wait, what?

4667
02:50:20,500 --> 02:50:20,940
You would be upset.

4668
02:50:21,460 --> 02:50:22,760
Like you would be upset.

4669
02:50:22,760 --> 02:50:24,280
Someone threatened to hurt Rose.

4670
02:50:24,640 --> 02:50:26,540
Yeah, well, we're not hurting Rose.

4671
02:50:27,380 --> 02:50:28,620
Wait, how do you get up there?

4672
02:50:28,900 --> 02:50:30,620
She needs her tears so she can have her parents back.

4673
02:50:31,200 --> 02:50:32,380
Uh, I have moon shoes.

4674
02:50:32,840 --> 02:50:33,880
Now let's move on.

4675
02:50:34,980 --> 02:50:36,360
Oh, I get... I know, I know.

4676
02:50:37,600 --> 02:50:38,440
I don't know.

4677
02:50:39,460 --> 02:50:40,500
Wait, the moon...

4678
02:50:40,500 --> 02:50:41,040
Where are you?

4679
02:50:41,080 --> 02:50:42,520
Where did you... How did you do that?

4680
02:50:42,540 --> 02:50:43,160
I'm trying to get there.

4681
02:50:43,360 --> 02:50:44,460
How did you do that?

4682
02:50:44,480 --> 02:50:44,900
I have moon shoes, man.

4683
02:50:45,400 --> 02:50:46,500
How did you do that?

4684
02:50:47,620 --> 02:50:48,020
Stop!

4685
02:50:48,380 --> 02:50:48,700
Oh.

4686
02:50:50,600 --> 02:50:51,380
Wait, how do...

4687
02:50:51,380 --> 02:50:52,520
What did I do as a big boy?

4688
02:50:56,020 --> 02:50:56,460
Oh!

4689
02:50:58,360 --> 02:50:58,800
Wait.

4690
02:50:59,180 --> 02:50:59,620
Oh!

4691
02:51:01,960 --> 02:51:02,400
Wait.

4692
02:51:02,820 --> 02:51:03,500
Actually, no.

4693
02:51:04,360 --> 02:51:04,800
Wait.

4694
02:51:08,340 --> 02:51:09,980
Where are my context clues?

4695
02:51:14,100 --> 02:51:15,480
Oh, I figured it out!

4696
02:51:15,500 --> 02:51:16,160
I figured it out!

4697
02:51:16,240 --> 02:51:17,060
I figured it out!

4698
02:51:18,780 --> 02:51:20,100
I go smart.

4699
02:51:22,200 --> 02:51:24,720
And then I do this.

4700
02:51:26,900 --> 02:51:28,480
Wait, do I do this in?

4701
02:51:28,660 --> 02:51:29,200
Mm-hmm.

4702
02:51:29,460 --> 02:51:30,400
I did it!

4703
02:51:31,480 --> 02:51:32,440
You know...

4704
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:35,200
I'm pretty smart.

4705
02:51:37,220 --> 02:51:38,080
Wait, don't you...

4706
02:51:38,080 --> 02:51:39,020
You can let go right now.

4707
02:51:40,220 --> 02:51:40,700
Yeah.

4708
02:51:40,840 --> 02:51:41,860
I know, I was just watching.

4709
02:51:42,180 --> 02:51:43,360
I was watching you scream.

4710
02:51:43,500 --> 02:51:43,760
You were just watching?

4711
02:51:44,200 --> 02:51:45,000
Mm-hmm.

4712
02:51:45,160 --> 02:51:46,080
That's fucked up.

4713
02:51:46,840 --> 02:51:48,180
We're supposed to be a team.

4714
02:51:48,980 --> 02:51:51,180
There's a control room at the very top.

4715
02:51:51,180 --> 02:51:54,160
If we can get up there, I think we can make it out of here.

4716
02:51:55,260 --> 02:51:55,840
What's this?

4717
02:51:57,420 --> 02:51:57,820
Oh.

4718
02:51:59,900 --> 02:52:00,440
What's this?

4719
02:52:01,740 --> 02:52:02,660
Oh, there's no battery.

4720
02:52:02,660 --> 02:52:03,220
You have to go in there.

4721
02:52:03,320 --> 02:52:03,920
You have to go in there.

4722
02:52:04,300 --> 02:52:05,400
Oh, okay.

4723
02:52:06,220 --> 02:52:07,900
See, this is why we're a team.

4724
02:52:08,040 --> 02:52:09,140
You're my context clues.

4725
02:52:11,300 --> 02:52:12,380
Okay, I'm pushing it in.

4726
02:52:13,720 --> 02:52:14,220
It's I.

4727
02:52:17,870 --> 02:52:21,170
You know, I think sometimes I just stop and I just watch.

4728
02:52:21,810 --> 02:52:22,210
What?

4729
02:52:22,210 --> 02:52:24,470
Because of how smart I am, right?

4730
02:52:25,010 --> 02:52:26,930
I just want to see how your mind works.

4731
02:52:27,490 --> 02:52:30,050
Yeah, because it's like a genius.

4732
02:52:30,930 --> 02:52:32,390
Maybe it takes us out of here.

4733
02:52:32,790 --> 02:52:34,310
I'm a genius.

4734
02:52:36,690 --> 02:52:39,430
You're just like so impressed with how this mind works.

4735
02:52:42,470 --> 02:52:43,290
What the fuck?

4736
02:52:43,290 --> 02:52:44,430
Wait, what the fuck is this?

4737
02:52:45,870 --> 02:52:47,390
Wait, I'm in somewhere else.

4738
02:52:47,530 --> 02:52:48,290
That was intense.

4739
02:52:50,670 --> 02:52:51,310
Oh, no.

4740
02:52:51,350 --> 02:52:51,850
I'm with you.

4741
02:52:51,930 --> 02:52:52,190
Wait, no, I'm here.

4742
02:52:52,190 --> 02:52:54,290
Oh, it's another game!

4743
02:52:54,770 --> 02:52:56,250
This is another game?

4744
02:52:56,530 --> 02:52:57,250
Spacewalk?

4745
02:52:59,330 --> 02:53:00,050
Okay...

4746
02:53:00,050 --> 02:53:01,690
Oh, we play this.

4747
02:53:02,470 --> 02:53:04,710
Land on platforms to clean...

4748
02:53:04,710 --> 02:53:06,370
Oh, it's like that crab game!

4749
02:53:10,370 --> 02:53:12,490
Oh no, this is platform.

4750
02:53:15,850 --> 02:53:17,030
What the fuck?

4751
02:53:17,830 --> 02:53:20,030
It's so slow!

4752
02:53:21,370 --> 02:53:21,930
Okay.

4753
02:53:24,690 --> 02:53:25,250
Okay.

4754
02:53:30,170 --> 02:53:31,350
Oh, oh, no!

4755
02:53:31,510 --> 02:53:32,870
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

4756
02:53:34,510 --> 02:53:35,630
Come on!

4757
02:53:35,930 --> 02:53:37,150
Give me more!

4758
02:53:38,030 --> 02:53:39,250
No, I fell!

4759
02:53:40,250 --> 02:53:40,810
No!

4760
02:53:41,910 --> 02:53:43,450
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

4761
02:53:43,550 --> 02:53:44,110
Yes!

4762
02:53:46,130 --> 02:53:46,690
Yes!

4763
02:53:47,870 --> 02:53:48,430
Mine!

4764
02:53:50,850 --> 02:53:51,950
Wait, that's fucked up.

4765
02:53:53,470 --> 02:53:54,450
That's fucked up.

4766
02:53:56,090 --> 02:53:57,150
That's fucked up.

4767
02:53:57,190 --> 02:53:58,090
I can do that too.

4768
02:53:59,290 --> 02:53:59,810
Yes!

4769
02:54:03,840 --> 02:54:05,160
I took yours!

4770
02:54:05,480 --> 02:54:06,500
I took yours!

4771
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:07,800
Another point for Doki!

4772
02:54:07,800 --> 02:54:10,180
I didn't realize I could take yours until later.

4773
02:54:13,560 --> 02:54:15,800
Another point for Doki!

4774
02:54:15,800 --> 02:54:16,220
Doki!

4775
02:54:17,300 --> 02:54:17,900
Yeah!

4776
02:54:19,880 --> 02:54:21,280
What the fuck was that?

4777
02:54:23,360 --> 02:54:25,400
It's called being a Winnie.

4778
02:54:28,860 --> 02:54:30,480
What is this?

4779
02:54:31,560 --> 02:54:34,100
I think I started like a supernova.

4780
02:54:34,760 --> 02:54:38,240
What the fuck?

4781
02:54:38,460 --> 02:54:40,420
Can we like shoot the stars into this?

4782
02:54:41,940 --> 02:54:43,880
I think we can go into the...

4783
02:54:44,620 --> 02:54:45,920
There's the world.

4784
02:54:46,700 --> 02:54:47,400
Oh, there is.

4785
02:54:47,460 --> 02:54:47,720
Yeah.

4786
02:54:48,400 --> 02:54:48,900
Alright.

4787
02:54:49,080 --> 02:54:49,880
Purple world.

4788
02:54:53,900 --> 02:54:54,580
What's this?

4789
02:55:01,040 --> 02:55:02,700
Can I step on it too?

4790
02:55:03,400 --> 02:55:04,160
Oh, we can?

4791
02:55:04,300 --> 02:55:06,140
Oh, it's like the monkey ball game.

4792
02:55:08,360 --> 02:55:09,100
Monkey ball?

4793
02:55:10,020 --> 02:55:10,060
Yeah.

4794
02:55:10,060 --> 02:55:10,780
Yeah.

4795
02:55:12,400 --> 02:55:13,200
Oh, I...

4796
02:55:13,200 --> 02:55:14,040
I think you have to push it.

4797
02:55:14,200 --> 02:55:14,440
Yeah.

4798
02:55:14,500 --> 02:55:15,920
Wait, how do I push it?

4799
02:55:17,840 --> 02:55:19,540
Why don't you try becoming big first?

4800
02:55:19,780 --> 02:55:20,220
Oh, I have to be big.

4801
02:55:20,220 --> 02:55:20,360
Big.

4802
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:21,780
Big time.

4803
02:55:21,960 --> 02:55:22,400
Okay.

4804
02:55:23,040 --> 02:55:23,700
I'm pushing.

4805
02:55:23,880 --> 02:55:24,460
Yeah, it is!

4806
02:55:24,520 --> 02:55:25,520
It's like that stupid...

4807
02:55:25,900 --> 02:55:27,040
The monkey ball!

4808
02:55:27,700 --> 02:55:29,120
Bro, I push so fucking slow.

4809
02:55:32,120 --> 02:55:32,560
Beeeeee.

4810
02:55:36,380 --> 02:55:36,820
Beeeeee.

4811
02:55:38,320 --> 02:55:38,760
Okay.

4812
02:55:38,760 --> 02:55:39,340
Don't worry.

4813
02:55:42,740 --> 02:55:43,460
I'm pushing.

4814
02:55:44,240 --> 02:55:45,100
I'm pushing.

4815
02:55:45,840 --> 02:55:46,500
Jesus Christ.

4816
02:55:46,540 --> 02:55:47,920
I wish I go faster.

4817
02:55:48,100 --> 02:55:49,160
I'm so slow though.

4818
02:55:51,080 --> 02:55:52,500
Can I actually go faster?

4819
02:55:52,620 --> 02:55:53,280
I can't.

4820
02:55:54,940 --> 02:55:55,920
Even if you dash?

4821
02:55:56,200 --> 02:55:56,440
No.

4822
02:55:56,540 --> 02:55:57,540
It won't let me.

4823
02:55:58,220 --> 02:56:00,300
I have to push as slow as possible.

4824
02:56:01,240 --> 02:56:02,120
Alright, here you go.

4825
02:56:05,960 --> 02:56:06,400
Alright.

4826
02:56:07,540 --> 02:56:08,340
I'm watching.

4827
02:56:08,520 --> 02:56:09,420
I'm watching you.

4828
02:56:10,260 --> 02:56:11,180
Now what do you do?

4829
02:56:12,260 --> 02:56:12,980
I don't know.

4830
02:56:13,800 --> 02:56:14,760
What do I do?

4831
02:56:15,380 --> 02:56:16,540
Do I just stay here?

4832
02:56:19,380 --> 02:56:19,820
Oh!

4833
02:56:20,040 --> 02:56:20,920
I smell it!

4834
02:56:20,960 --> 02:56:21,340
I smell it!

4835
02:56:24,240 --> 02:56:25,400
Oh, you crushed me.

4836
02:56:25,480 --> 02:56:25,680
Okay.

4837
02:56:27,280 --> 02:56:28,560
That's a little fucked up.

4838
02:56:28,600 --> 02:56:29,360
But that's okay.

4839
02:56:30,680 --> 02:56:33,480
I knew what I signed up for when I said I do.

4840
02:56:35,780 --> 02:56:36,480
Wait, what?

4841
02:56:37,580 --> 02:56:38,320
Okay, yeah.

4842
02:56:38,380 --> 02:56:38,580
I'm ready.

4843
02:56:40,960 --> 02:56:41,680
Go slow.

4844
02:56:42,940 --> 02:56:43,420
Push it.

4845
02:56:45,330 --> 02:56:45,810
Alright.

4846
02:56:49,440 --> 02:56:49,920
Oh!

4847
02:56:50,740 --> 02:56:51,720
Can I push up?

4848
02:56:52,380 --> 02:56:53,020
Oh, maybe.

4849
02:56:53,160 --> 02:56:53,540
Oh!

4850
02:56:54,260 --> 02:56:54,660
Oh!

4851
02:56:54,800 --> 02:56:55,680
You have to push back up.

4852
02:56:55,780 --> 02:56:56,680
You stay small.

4853
02:56:58,560 --> 02:57:01,480
I can't keep staying small when I'm excited.

4854
02:57:02,760 --> 02:57:03,240
What?

4855
02:57:09,580 --> 02:57:10,600
I'm pushing it in.

4856
02:57:14,120 --> 02:57:15,120
Push it in!

4857
02:57:15,120 --> 02:57:15,260
Push it in!

4858
02:57:15,260 --> 02:57:15,780
I'm not done!

4859
02:57:26,540 --> 02:57:29,060
Oh, at least it teleports us, which is nice.

4860
02:57:29,160 --> 02:57:30,580
We don't have to walk back.

4861
02:57:36,250 --> 02:57:37,030
Alright, we got it.

4862
02:57:37,030 --> 02:57:37,970
I missed the back shots.

4863
02:57:38,510 --> 02:57:39,270
We got it.

4864
02:57:39,410 --> 02:57:41,390
Go to red.

4865
02:57:41,570 --> 02:57:42,130
Red portal.

4866
02:57:42,190 --> 02:57:42,530
Red portal.

4867
02:57:44,210 --> 02:57:45,210
Because I'm red.

4868
02:57:47,750 --> 02:57:48,930
How are you red?

4869
02:57:49,230 --> 02:57:49,810
I'm red!

4870
02:57:49,950 --> 02:57:50,230
Look!

4871
02:57:51,030 --> 02:57:51,930
Look at my shirt!

4872
02:57:52,150 --> 02:57:53,170
Look at my shirt!

4873
02:57:53,450 --> 02:57:54,650
And tell me that's not red.

4874
02:57:54,850 --> 02:57:55,290
That's orange.

4875
02:57:55,290 --> 02:57:55,290
That's red!

4876
02:57:57,630 --> 02:57:58,730
You just don't understand.

4877
02:58:01,130 --> 02:58:02,770
Do we both need to be here?

4878
02:58:04,010 --> 02:58:05,830
Oh, it went all the way up.

4879
02:58:07,110 --> 02:58:07,570
Red?

4880
02:58:07,730 --> 02:58:08,590
Oh, it's this way.

4881
02:58:09,450 --> 02:58:10,830
You have to jump on the planets.

4882
02:58:11,530 --> 02:58:13,350
Oh, it's this way.

4883
02:58:13,350 --> 02:58:14,630
And then...

4884
02:58:14,630 --> 02:58:16,470
The planet made me slide off.

4885
02:58:16,610 --> 02:58:17,670
That was fucked up.

4886
02:58:18,210 --> 02:58:19,710
Don't worry, you'll get there eventually.

4887
02:58:21,270 --> 02:58:22,250
I'm here now!

4888
02:58:22,610 --> 02:58:23,890
I believe in you, Gumi!

4889
02:58:25,370 --> 02:58:26,310
I believe!

4890
02:58:26,930 --> 02:58:27,430
Boom.

4891
02:58:29,990 --> 02:58:32,110
Why are you saying these things?

4892
02:58:33,350 --> 02:58:34,510
Why are you saying these things?

4893
02:58:38,750 --> 02:58:40,090
What do I do for this?

4894
02:58:40,090 --> 02:58:40,630
Goddamn.

4895
02:58:42,410 --> 02:58:43,710
How do you do for this?

4896
02:58:46,510 --> 02:58:46,870
Oh!

4897
02:58:46,870 --> 02:58:48,030
Maybe like...

4898
02:58:48,030 --> 02:58:48,290
Oh!

4899
02:58:48,430 --> 02:58:49,030
Get on it!

4900
02:58:49,090 --> 02:58:49,790
You have to get on it!

4901
02:58:49,950 --> 02:58:51,610
And then I like...

4902
02:58:52,010 --> 02:58:52,630
Wait, what?

4903
02:58:53,350 --> 02:58:54,690
Oh, wait, you're already on there.

4904
02:58:54,810 --> 02:58:55,070
Okay.

4905
02:58:55,290 --> 02:58:56,450
And then you hit me that way.

4906
02:58:56,670 --> 02:58:57,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4907
02:58:57,430 --> 02:58:59,610
And then I hit you to the front.

4908
02:59:02,450 --> 02:59:02,810
Bam!

4909
02:59:02,810 --> 02:59:03,170
Slap!

4910
02:59:04,670 --> 02:59:05,030
Okay.

4911
02:59:06,230 --> 02:59:06,590
Me

4912
02:59:10,640 --> 02:59:11,180
up there?

4913
02:59:11,420 --> 02:59:12,440
Yeah, how do you get me up there?

4914
02:59:14,140 --> 02:59:14,980
Uh, go to the drawers.

4915
02:59:15,380 --> 02:59:16,300
The drawers?

4916
02:59:16,460 --> 02:59:17,020
There's the drawers.

4917
02:59:17,440 --> 02:59:18,000
The drawers?

4918
02:59:18,460 --> 02:59:19,260
To your lab?

4919
02:59:19,580 --> 02:59:20,460
The drawers?

4920
02:59:21,120 --> 02:59:22,200
Oh, I see, I see!

4921
02:59:22,400 --> 02:59:22,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4922
02:59:23,460 --> 02:59:24,020
I'm in.

4923
02:59:25,240 --> 02:59:25,840
Got it.

4924
02:59:29,380 --> 02:59:32,540
I fucked up, I fucked up, I fucked up, I fucked up, I fucked up.

4925
02:59:32,740 --> 02:59:33,660
You gotta restart.

4926
02:59:33,840 --> 02:59:34,680
You gotta restart.

4927
02:59:34,800 --> 02:59:35,720
I fucked up.

4928
02:59:38,080 --> 02:59:40,420
Yeah, sometimes husbands make mistakes.

4929
02:59:41,100 --> 02:59:42,200
You can't be perfect.

4930
02:59:42,540 --> 02:59:42,700
Oh.

4931
02:59:44,140 --> 02:59:45,840
Because being perfect is very... More often than not.

4932
02:59:46,180 --> 02:59:49,600
Being perfect makes the relationship very toxic.

4933
02:59:50,780 --> 02:59:54,320
You gotta be able to make mistakes to show that you're human.

4934
02:59:54,740 --> 02:59:54,860
Oh!

4935
02:59:55,400 --> 02:59:56,000
Hello?

4936
02:59:57,960 --> 02:59:58,960
There, I'm good.

4937
02:59:59,120 --> 02:59:59,660
I'm in.

4938
03:00:01,980 --> 03:00:03,560
Okay, I'm tiny.

4939
03:00:04,620 --> 03:00:05,440
Tiny man.

4940
03:00:06,160 --> 03:00:06,900
Tiny man!

4941
03:00:08,020 --> 03:00:08,960
Oh, shit.

4942
03:00:09,200 --> 03:00:10,720
Tiny man dropped off.

4943
03:00:11,220 --> 03:00:12,940
Tiny man is still walking up.

4944
03:00:13,140 --> 03:00:14,040
It's okay.

4945
03:00:14,040 --> 03:00:14,760
I'm gonna check on the left side.

4946
03:00:14,860 --> 03:00:15,240
That's me.

4947
03:00:16,340 --> 03:00:17,300
Hey, I got this.

4948
03:00:17,520 --> 03:00:19,740
Alright, I'm pressing it in 3, 2, 1.

4949
03:00:23,320 --> 03:00:23,740
Yeah!

4950
03:00:23,880 --> 03:00:24,800
He happy now!

4951
03:00:26,580 --> 03:00:27,500
I'm the short king.

4952
03:00:31,620 --> 03:00:32,760
Alright, last portal.

4953
03:00:34,100 --> 03:00:35,860
I'm surprised we're not at the school yet.

4954
03:00:37,340 --> 03:00:38,700
We're not at the math problem.

4955
03:00:39,080 --> 03:00:43,300
I told you, there was... The only thing I remember from watching people play this game...

4956
03:00:43,300 --> 03:00:45,520
...is the one where there was math problems.

4957
03:00:45,920 --> 03:00:47,140
No, I know what you're talking about.

4958
03:00:47,240 --> 03:00:49,380
Yeah, that's the only... That's like apparently the only like...

4959
03:00:49,380 --> 03:00:51,220
...clippable thing people clip from that game.

4960
03:00:54,100 --> 03:00:54,940
Cause like, I...

4961
03:00:54,940 --> 03:00:58,100
I don't know... I did not know all of these other things existed.

4962
03:00:58,420 --> 03:00:59,280
That's for sure.

4963
03:00:59,580 --> 03:01:04,700
I didn't know all these other things existed in this fucking game.

4964
03:01:06,540 --> 03:01:07,020
Nice.

4965
03:01:07,420 --> 03:01:08,420
Did we just jump?

4966
03:01:09,200 --> 03:01:10,300
I assume we just jumped.

4967
03:01:10,560 --> 03:01:10,880
Oh!

4968
03:01:11,060 --> 03:01:12,320
I jumped a little too forward.

4969
03:01:12,540 --> 03:01:13,040
Me too.

4970
03:01:14,360 --> 03:01:15,160
Me too.

4971
03:01:19,340 --> 03:01:20,560
Alright, we can do this.

4972
03:01:25,160 --> 03:01:25,560
What?!

4973
03:01:25,560 --> 03:01:26,520
It's okay, I believe in you.

4974
03:01:26,560 --> 03:01:27,220
You live for me.

4975
03:01:27,260 --> 03:01:28,080
Live on for me!

4976
03:01:29,140 --> 03:01:30,420
I'm about to die on purpose.

4977
03:01:31,660 --> 03:01:32,060
Yay!

4978
03:01:32,160 --> 03:01:33,020
I did it!

4979
03:01:35,640 --> 03:01:36,040
Yay!

4980
03:01:36,200 --> 03:01:36,960
Oh my god, look!

4981
03:01:36,960 --> 03:01:38,200
It's like the android symbol!

4982
03:01:38,820 --> 03:01:39,160
Oh yeah, it is!

4983
03:01:41,580 --> 03:01:42,960
I assume like...

4984
03:01:42,960 --> 03:01:44,340
Oh, I assume I do this.

4985
03:01:44,420 --> 03:01:44,640
Yeah.

4986
03:01:46,680 --> 03:01:47,560
And then...

4987
03:01:48,560 --> 03:01:49,000
Oh.

4988
03:01:49,200 --> 03:01:50,220
Oh, I do small...

4989
03:01:50,680 --> 03:01:51,420
I'm small.

4990
03:01:55,090 --> 03:01:55,530
Okay.

4991
03:01:56,670 --> 03:01:57,410
Big time.

4992
03:01:58,890 --> 03:02:00,110
Wait, I have to launch you.

4993
03:02:01,950 --> 03:02:02,390
Maybe?

4994
03:02:02,550 --> 03:02:04,210
Or do you launch... Oh yeah, I do launch you.

4995
03:02:05,430 --> 03:02:06,310
Oh, we flip!

4996
03:02:12,150 --> 03:02:14,950
Our brain is expanding so much from this game.

4997
03:02:16,150 --> 03:02:16,590
Dude.

4998
03:02:19,710 --> 03:02:20,110
Wait.

4999
03:02:20,490 --> 03:02:21,610
Can I do something here?

5000
03:02:22,110 --> 03:02:22,810
What do I do?

5001
03:02:23,870 --> 03:02:24,270
Big?

5002
03:02:25,770 --> 03:02:26,170
Big.

5003
03:02:26,330 --> 03:02:26,630
Yeah.

5004
03:02:28,410 --> 03:02:28,990
Where am I?

5005
03:02:29,730 --> 03:02:30,850
You have to wind it.

5006
03:02:31,870 --> 03:02:32,270
Oh.

5007
03:02:32,370 --> 03:02:33,350
So I get down there.

5008
03:02:33,570 --> 03:02:34,450
No, no, wind it back.

5009
03:02:34,490 --> 03:02:35,170
Cause it's a spring.

5010
03:02:35,230 --> 03:02:35,430
Okay.

5011
03:02:35,430 --> 03:02:36,570
And then it launches me.

5012
03:02:36,730 --> 03:02:37,010
Okay.

5013
03:02:39,130 --> 03:02:39,530
Okay.

5014
03:02:41,050 --> 03:02:42,190
I figured it out.

5015
03:02:42,210 --> 03:02:43,010
It was the other way.

5016
03:02:46,150 --> 03:02:46,550
Hey!

5017
03:02:48,650 --> 03:02:50,070
I did it.

5018
03:02:50,130 --> 03:02:50,530
I did it.

5019
03:02:52,310 --> 03:02:53,390
My god.

5020
03:02:53,550 --> 03:02:57,090
Sometimes I wonder how I... how my brain works sometimes.

5021
03:02:57,630 --> 03:02:58,590
Oh, relax.

5022
03:03:00,570 --> 03:03:03,150
How will people know I'm the world's greatest dad?

5023
03:03:04,570 --> 03:03:05,490
It's okay.

5024
03:03:06,070 --> 03:03:08,150
I don't think they need to know any lies.

5025
03:03:09,470 --> 03:03:12,010
This is why there's no world's greatest mom.

5026
03:03:14,450 --> 03:03:15,150
Whoa.

5027
03:03:17,610 --> 03:03:19,430
After all I've done for our house?

5028
03:03:19,790 --> 03:03:20,410
Like what?

5029
03:03:20,510 --> 03:03:20,850
Like what?

5030
03:03:20,890 --> 03:03:21,630
What have you done?

5031
03:03:21,790 --> 03:03:22,390
You need to get closer.

5032
03:03:22,390 --> 03:03:23,490
You need to get closer, bitch.

5033
03:03:23,530 --> 03:03:24,170
What have you done?

5034
03:03:24,270 --> 03:03:25,730
What have you done for this house?

5035
03:03:26,270 --> 03:03:28,710
I work jobs to pay our bills!

5036
03:03:28,830 --> 03:03:31,170
While you sit there and make potato chips!

5037
03:03:31,730 --> 03:03:32,130
Yeah.

5038
03:03:32,270 --> 03:03:33,290
But you're eating them.

5039
03:03:33,450 --> 03:03:33,910
No one eats.

5040
03:03:34,490 --> 03:03:34,890
Oh!

5041
03:03:35,110 --> 03:03:36,510
You ate one!

5042
03:03:37,370 --> 03:03:39,810
No, that was a homemade rice cracker.

5043
03:03:39,810 --> 03:03:41,030
That's not what you said last night.

5044
03:03:42,590 --> 03:03:43,590
Son of a bitch.

5045
03:03:43,590 --> 03:03:43,990
What?

5046
03:03:48,690 --> 03:03:49,730
Now swing.

5047
03:03:51,490 --> 03:03:53,350
Oh, I have to put that there.

5048
03:03:54,110 --> 03:03:54,630
Alright.

5049
03:03:55,850 --> 03:03:57,470
Oh, we're like a pendulum!

5050
03:03:58,530 --> 03:03:59,050
Wee!

5051
03:03:59,170 --> 03:03:59,730
A pendulum?

5052
03:03:59,950 --> 03:04:01,450
A pendulum.

5053
03:04:02,550 --> 03:04:03,070
Yay!

5054
03:04:05,470 --> 03:04:05,990
Wow!

5055
03:04:06,450 --> 03:04:06,970
Okay!

5056
03:04:08,130 --> 03:04:09,850
Wait, which way is up?

5057
03:04:09,990 --> 03:04:10,750
You're alright, Mae.

5058
03:04:10,990 --> 03:04:11,890
Look, I'm up here!

5059
03:04:12,070 --> 03:04:12,650
I mean, that way.

5060
03:04:12,650 --> 03:04:13,310
We're gonna swing!

5061
03:04:14,450 --> 03:04:14,890
Wee!

5062
03:04:16,250 --> 03:04:16,690
Yeah.

5063
03:04:18,390 --> 03:04:20,050
This doesn't seem to be working okay.

5064
03:04:20,710 --> 03:04:21,830
I mean, we're alive.

5065
03:04:23,170 --> 03:04:24,710
So I think it's good progress.

5066
03:04:24,890 --> 03:04:25,270
Oh!

5067
03:04:25,310 --> 03:04:25,770
Here I go.

5068
03:04:26,610 --> 03:04:27,050
Small.

5069
03:04:28,230 --> 03:04:28,670
BB.

5070
03:04:29,850 --> 03:04:31,130
Don't worry, I'm heading over.

5071
03:04:31,830 --> 03:04:32,770
I'm very slow.

5072
03:04:32,770 --> 03:04:33,250
This is fucked up.

5073
03:04:33,270 --> 03:04:34,730
I can't see your screen anymore.

5074
03:04:35,950 --> 03:04:36,650
I'm here.

5075
03:04:39,570 --> 03:04:40,290
We do it?

5076
03:04:40,930 --> 03:04:41,650
We did it!

5077
03:04:42,630 --> 03:04:43,470
We opened it!

5078
03:04:43,590 --> 03:04:45,350
That should be all of them, right?

5079
03:04:45,510 --> 03:04:46,390
I think so.

5080
03:04:46,950 --> 03:04:47,890
Good teamwork.

5081
03:04:48,150 --> 03:04:48,270
See?

5082
03:04:48,530 --> 03:04:50,590
Even the game thinks we have good teamwork.

5083
03:04:52,730 --> 03:04:53,210
See?

5084
03:04:53,450 --> 03:04:53,570
Even the game thinks we have good teamwork.

5085
03:04:53,570 --> 03:04:54,010
Look at that!

5086
03:04:55,930 --> 03:04:56,650
Oh, it's open.

5087
03:04:56,870 --> 03:04:57,710
I'll go on the other side.

5088
03:04:59,930 --> 03:05:01,210
Which way do I turn?

5089
03:05:01,810 --> 03:05:02,470
This way?

5090
03:05:03,830 --> 03:05:05,030
This room is this way.

5091
03:05:06,210 --> 03:05:07,710
Am I turning the right way?

5092
03:05:09,190 --> 03:05:09,970
I am!

5093
03:05:10,330 --> 03:05:10,490
I am!

5094
03:05:10,490 --> 03:05:13,290
Oh, here we go again!

5095
03:05:13,590 --> 03:05:15,830
Gumi is carrying this- What do you mean?

5096
03:05:16,070 --> 03:05:17,290
You need a fun dad!

5097
03:05:17,990 --> 03:05:20,690
Every relationship always has a fun dad.

5098
03:05:20,790 --> 03:05:21,470
And that's me.

5099
03:05:21,490 --> 03:05:22,230
I'm the good cop.

5100
03:05:22,750 --> 03:05:23,990
I wouldn't know.

5101
03:05:27,970 --> 03:05:33,990
The reason you fell in love with this beautiful man is because I was just so fun.

5102
03:05:35,330 --> 03:05:36,310
Put your feet away.

5103
03:05:39,690 --> 03:05:40,210
Collaboration.

5104
03:05:40,270 --> 03:05:41,690
Blah blah blah blah blah.

5105
03:05:41,770 --> 03:05:43,190
Oh, blah blah blah blah blah.

5106
03:05:43,230 --> 03:05:43,390
Huh?

5107
03:05:44,230 --> 03:05:45,890
Oh, you're pissing him off.

5108
03:05:49,850 --> 03:05:50,810
Blah blah blah blah.

5109
03:05:51,070 --> 03:05:51,210
Blah blah blah blah.

5110
03:05:51,310 --> 03:05:51,670
Blah blah blah?

5111
03:05:51,790 --> 03:05:52,270
Collaboration.

5112
03:05:55,610 --> 03:05:56,570
We collabed!

5113
03:05:56,650 --> 03:05:59,150
We've collabed for like three hours now!

5114
03:06:00,450 --> 03:06:00,970
Don't worry.

5115
03:06:01,130 --> 03:06:01,910
Oh, wait, is that a game?

5116
03:06:01,950 --> 03:06:02,510
There's a game!

5117
03:06:02,630 --> 03:06:02,970
There's a game!

5118
03:06:03,630 --> 03:06:04,830
There's a game!

5119
03:06:06,230 --> 03:06:07,190
I've left.

5120
03:06:07,650 --> 03:06:08,450
There's a game!

5121
03:06:08,630 --> 03:06:09,290
I left too.

5122
03:06:10,790 --> 03:06:12,570
You gotta pick where I'm going.

5123
03:06:14,210 --> 03:06:16,510
I wait for you here in game town.

5124
03:06:16,750 --> 03:06:18,370
You fucking bitch.

5125
03:06:18,850 --> 03:06:20,150
Oh my god, it's tennis!

5126
03:06:20,550 --> 03:06:21,050
Check it out, man!

5127
03:06:21,870 --> 03:06:23,310
See, I'm so fun!

5128
03:06:23,790 --> 03:06:26,550
I let you experience fun things, Gumi.

5129
03:06:26,850 --> 03:06:28,610
My hand hurts.

5130
03:06:29,430 --> 03:06:30,810
I'm the fun dad!

5131
03:06:31,090 --> 03:06:32,390
We get to play!

5132
03:06:33,470 --> 03:06:35,390
We get to play games!

5133
03:06:37,890 --> 03:06:39,730
I need a nappy.

5134
03:06:40,250 --> 03:06:40,830
Gumi!

5135
03:06:41,290 --> 03:06:42,210
Fun dad!

5136
03:06:42,450 --> 03:06:43,030
Fun dad!

5137
03:06:43,030 --> 03:06:43,550
Fun dad!

5138
03:06:44,330 --> 03:06:45,550
Let's see what this is about.

5139
03:06:45,910 --> 03:06:46,090
Alright.

5140
03:06:49,510 --> 03:06:49,950
Hello?

5141
03:06:50,110 --> 03:06:50,490
Hello?

5142
03:06:51,830 --> 03:06:52,950
Dodge the lasers?

5143
03:06:52,970 --> 03:06:53,550
Dodge the lasers.

5144
03:06:55,690 --> 03:06:56,270
Where's that?

5145
03:06:57,210 --> 03:06:57,650
Oh!

5146
03:06:59,850 --> 03:07:00,750
Oh, I see.

5147
03:07:01,490 --> 03:07:02,510
I see now.

5148
03:07:03,970 --> 03:07:06,030
Oh, I know where you're gonna throw the lasers.

5149
03:07:06,090 --> 03:07:06,710
Watch this.

5150
03:07:07,830 --> 03:07:08,270
Bam!

5151
03:07:09,770 --> 03:07:10,210
Dodged!

5152
03:07:11,730 --> 03:07:12,470
Oh, wait.

5153
03:07:12,590 --> 03:07:13,010
Oh, now.

5154
03:07:13,050 --> 03:07:13,550
Oh, no.

5155
03:07:13,570 --> 03:07:14,230
Now it starts.

5156
03:07:14,530 --> 03:07:14,810
Okay.

5157
03:07:15,130 --> 03:07:15,670
Okay.

5158
03:07:22,500 --> 03:07:23,240
Oh, god.

5159
03:07:23,660 --> 03:07:25,380
Wait, this is not fun anymore.

5160
03:07:25,640 --> 03:07:26,320
This is...

5161
03:07:29,400 --> 03:07:29,940
Wait.

5162
03:07:31,940 --> 03:07:32,820
Oh, god.

5163
03:07:32,940 --> 03:07:33,420
Oh, god.

5164
03:07:37,620 --> 03:07:38,160
Woo!

5165
03:07:39,460 --> 03:07:40,000
Woo!

5166
03:07:43,390 --> 03:07:44,030
Fuck that!

5167
03:07:44,030 --> 03:07:45,130
Lock the fucking...

5168
03:07:46,490 --> 03:07:47,330
I'm trying!

5169
03:07:47,590 --> 03:07:47,910
No!

5170
03:07:48,010 --> 03:07:48,350
No!

5171
03:07:50,050 --> 03:07:50,510
No, no, no!

5172
03:07:50,590 --> 03:07:51,190
I'm still up!

5173
03:07:52,270 --> 03:07:53,230
I'm still up!

5174
03:07:54,750 --> 03:07:55,190
I'm still up!

5175
03:07:55,190 --> 03:07:55,530
Oh, no.

5176
03:07:55,910 --> 03:07:56,790
Oh, no.

5177
03:07:57,610 --> 03:07:58,990
Oh, the fun dad!

5178
03:08:03,070 --> 03:08:04,390
I'm still the fun dad.

5179
03:08:04,910 --> 03:08:06,650
You can't take this away from me.

5180
03:08:06,690 --> 03:08:07,490
Oh, no.

5181
03:08:09,470 --> 03:08:11,390
Why are you so good at this?

5182
03:08:13,010 --> 03:08:15,070
Yeah, I play a lot of...

5183
03:08:15,070 --> 03:08:16,390
Oh, my god!

5184
03:08:16,890 --> 03:08:18,810
Why are you so good at this?

5185
03:08:18,810 --> 03:08:19,510
I didn't get hit once.

5186
03:08:19,550 --> 03:08:20,030
I didn't get hit once.

5187
03:08:20,050 --> 03:08:20,630
I didn't get hit once.

5188
03:08:26,860 --> 03:08:29,360
You're so good at this one.

5189
03:08:30,800 --> 03:08:32,880
I think I'm better at reaction time.

5190
03:08:34,280 --> 03:08:36,060
You're better at the aiming thing.

5191
03:08:39,100 --> 03:08:40,140
Holy fuck.

5192
03:08:40,740 --> 03:08:42,060
That shit was intense.

5193
03:08:43,660 --> 03:08:44,620
Okay, which one?

5194
03:08:46,640 --> 03:08:47,540
Oh, wait.

5195
03:08:47,620 --> 03:08:49,040
There's multiple new ones, right?

5196
03:08:49,200 --> 03:08:49,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5197
03:08:50,280 --> 03:08:51,440
Let's go to the beach.

5198
03:08:51,440 --> 03:08:51,740
Beach?

5199
03:08:51,980 --> 03:08:52,500
Wait.

5200
03:08:52,540 --> 03:08:52,740
Did we go to the beach?

5201
03:08:52,760 --> 03:08:53,580
Did we go on the wrong one?

5202
03:08:54,640 --> 03:08:55,680
I don't think so.

5203
03:08:57,120 --> 03:08:57,760
Oh, no.

5204
03:08:57,820 --> 03:08:58,400
We got the right one.

5205
03:08:58,460 --> 03:08:58,660
Okay.

5206
03:08:59,280 --> 03:09:00,480
You were so focused.

5207
03:09:02,520 --> 03:09:03,520
Oh, I have a door.

5208
03:09:03,800 --> 03:09:04,740
A little door.

5209
03:09:05,420 --> 03:09:06,500
I can't do anything.

5210
03:09:06,720 --> 03:09:07,540
Oh, my god!

5211
03:09:07,560 --> 03:09:08,420
I'm a pinball!

5212
03:09:08,880 --> 03:09:09,800
Get the pinball me!

5213
03:09:13,820 --> 03:09:15,060
No, no, no, no, no.

5214
03:09:15,120 --> 03:09:15,800
Right, right, right, right, right.

5215
03:09:15,920 --> 03:09:16,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5216
03:09:16,600 --> 03:09:16,760
Here, here, here.

5217
03:09:17,500 --> 03:09:19,340
Oh, wait.

5218
03:09:19,400 --> 03:09:19,800
I can move.

5219
03:09:21,540 --> 03:09:21,980
Okay.

5220
03:09:23,020 --> 03:09:23,600
Don't worry.

5221
03:09:23,680 --> 03:09:24,240
I got this.

5222
03:09:25,120 --> 03:09:26,340
That's why I'm the fun guy.

5223
03:09:26,340 --> 03:09:26,700
I have to talk.

5224
03:09:26,760 --> 03:09:28,820
I actually have to watch your screen now.

5225
03:09:30,740 --> 03:09:31,180
What?

5226
03:09:32,240 --> 03:09:32,680
What?

5227
03:09:33,140 --> 03:09:34,460
Who messed up now, huh?

5228
03:09:34,700 --> 03:09:35,440
Okay, fine.

5229
03:09:35,780 --> 03:09:36,540
That was on me!

5230
03:09:36,600 --> 03:09:36,880
I'll be honest.

5231
03:09:37,240 --> 03:09:38,840
I just wanted to see if you would die.

5232
03:09:39,720 --> 03:09:40,700
What the fuck?

5233
03:09:40,720 --> 03:09:41,940
I did it on purpose.

5234
03:09:42,140 --> 03:09:42,660
I'll be honest.

5235
03:09:43,000 --> 03:09:44,240
What the fuck?

5236
03:09:44,280 --> 03:09:45,360
We have to do this again.

5237
03:09:46,600 --> 03:09:48,000
I just wanted to see you die.

5238
03:09:48,000 --> 03:09:49,660
I was preying on your downfall.

5239
03:09:49,900 --> 03:09:51,340
That is so messed up.

5240
03:09:51,780 --> 03:09:53,460
That is so messed up.

5241
03:09:55,560 --> 03:09:56,720
You fucker.

5242
03:09:56,740 --> 03:09:57,740
You fucker!

5243
03:10:00,260 --> 03:10:00,860
Fucker.

5244
03:10:01,360 --> 03:10:04,200
After all you put me through today, it's well deserved.

5245
03:10:04,500 --> 03:10:05,060
What do you mean?

5246
03:10:05,180 --> 03:10:06,440
This is a team game!

5247
03:10:06,600 --> 03:10:09,580
We don't progress if you don't do it.

5248
03:10:10,180 --> 03:10:11,680
Hey, I'm having fun.

5249
03:10:12,060 --> 03:10:13,200
I'm having fun.

5250
03:10:15,640 --> 03:10:16,740
You bitch.

5251
03:10:19,660 --> 03:10:20,300
Don't worry.

5252
03:10:21,080 --> 03:10:21,880
Don't worry.

5253
03:10:22,060 --> 03:10:23,100
Imagine if you missed.

5254
03:10:23,240 --> 03:10:26,140
That would be so messed up if I missed it.

5255
03:10:26,360 --> 03:10:28,420
Oh my god, I still get blown up.

5256
03:10:28,600 --> 03:10:31,340
That was the most painful game of pinball I have ever played.

5257
03:10:31,600 --> 03:10:31,720
That was the most painful game of pinball I have ever played.

5258
03:10:31,720 --> 03:10:32,960
We do what we have to, Cody.

5259
03:10:33,120 --> 03:10:34,480
I still fucking died.

5260
03:10:34,640 --> 03:10:35,760
That's so fucked up.

5261
03:10:37,840 --> 03:10:38,700
What is this?

5262
03:10:39,020 --> 03:10:40,360
I don't know, but you gotta climb it.

5263
03:10:40,640 --> 03:10:41,820
What the fuck is that?

5264
03:10:42,140 --> 03:10:42,920
What are you doing over there?

5265
03:10:43,020 --> 03:10:45,100
I hip thrusted a rocket.

5266
03:10:45,460 --> 03:10:47,200
You need to stop hip thrusting, man.

5267
03:10:48,000 --> 03:10:48,260
Stop.

5268
03:10:49,240 --> 03:10:50,380
I can never stop.

5269
03:10:50,460 --> 03:10:51,380
Why don't we have a second child yet?

5270
03:10:53,140 --> 03:10:54,320
That's on you.

5271
03:10:54,540 --> 03:10:55,360
What the fuck does that do?

5272
03:10:55,580 --> 03:10:56,080
I don't know.

5273
03:10:56,360 --> 03:10:56,820
What is this?

5274
03:10:56,860 --> 03:10:57,680
Oh, what the hell?

5275
03:11:06,940 --> 03:11:08,120
There it is.

5276
03:11:08,820 --> 03:11:09,560
There it is.

5277
03:11:09,840 --> 03:11:10,460
It's over there.

5278
03:11:10,460 --> 03:11:11,340
You need to turn it off.

5279
03:11:11,380 --> 03:11:12,540
You need to turn it off!

5280
03:11:13,100 --> 03:11:13,500
Oh.

5281
03:11:13,680 --> 03:11:14,800
What was that?

5282
03:11:14,800 --> 03:11:16,000
I can't stop.

5283
03:11:17,020 --> 03:11:19,680
How was I supposed to know that I died?

5284
03:11:24,040 --> 03:11:26,180
You need to turn something on, clearly.

5285
03:11:28,500 --> 03:11:29,600
Do I do this?

5286
03:11:30,100 --> 03:11:30,620
Yeah.

5287
03:11:32,060 --> 03:11:33,580
Then I can do this.

5288
03:11:34,480 --> 03:11:35,080
Boop, boop.

5289
03:11:35,180 --> 03:11:35,760
I fucking...

5290
03:11:35,760 --> 03:11:39,200
I can feel you wanted to turn that on.

5291
03:11:39,200 --> 03:11:39,700
I thought about it.

5292
03:11:39,720 --> 03:11:40,640
You thought about it.

5293
03:11:40,660 --> 03:11:44,740
I can see your brain thinking about it there.

5294
03:11:45,460 --> 03:11:45,980
I can see your brain thinking about it there.

5295
03:11:48,320 --> 03:11:48,800
Okay.

5296
03:11:48,960 --> 03:11:50,260
I'm pressing it in now.

5297
03:11:51,540 --> 03:11:52,060
It's in.

5298
03:11:52,680 --> 03:11:53,260
It's in.

5299
03:11:54,320 --> 03:11:55,420
I don't know if you noticed.

5300
03:11:57,580 --> 03:11:58,320
Hold on, what?

5301
03:11:58,460 --> 03:11:58,880
It's in?

5302
03:11:59,700 --> 03:12:00,620
Is it in yet?

5303
03:12:03,980 --> 03:12:05,000
I've said that before.

5304
03:12:12,120 --> 03:12:14,220
We were making our first child.

5305
03:12:16,280 --> 03:12:19,020
And that is why we only have one kid.

5306
03:12:19,340 --> 03:12:20,140
And that is why we only have one kid.

5307
03:12:20,140 --> 03:12:21,700
Wait, which color did you go into?

5308
03:12:22,460 --> 03:12:25,320
I went to the one on the left of what we just finished.

5309
03:12:25,560 --> 03:12:25,980
Which color?

5310
03:12:26,120 --> 03:12:26,640
Is this orange?

5311
03:12:26,780 --> 03:12:27,460
Oh, it's orange.

5312
03:12:27,600 --> 03:12:29,100
I was looking at your screen and not mine.

5313
03:12:31,240 --> 03:12:31,680
Cool.

5314
03:12:33,360 --> 03:12:34,700
Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

5315
03:12:36,600 --> 03:12:37,660
Alright, I heal you.

5316
03:12:38,540 --> 03:12:38,980
Boop.

5317
03:12:39,020 --> 03:12:40,320
You can't find me.

5318
03:12:40,880 --> 03:12:41,700
Where do I go?

5319
03:12:41,700 --> 03:12:41,940
Where do I go?

5320
03:12:44,560 --> 03:12:45,660
Do I go up here?

5321
03:12:46,720 --> 03:12:48,340
No, you're supposed to go straight forward.

5322
03:12:48,640 --> 03:12:49,420
I'm here.

5323
03:12:49,580 --> 03:12:50,320
Don't worry.

5324
03:12:51,340 --> 03:12:52,900
The husband is here.

5325
03:12:53,080 --> 03:12:53,940
Oh, I can hip-thresh this.

5326
03:12:54,260 --> 03:12:54,960
Watch this.

5327
03:12:55,300 --> 03:12:55,800
Ugh.

5328
03:12:56,860 --> 03:12:59,060
I have a lot of pent-up aggression right now.

5329
03:12:59,460 --> 03:12:59,980
No!

5330
03:13:07,260 --> 03:13:07,780
No!

5331
03:13:07,780 --> 03:13:08,600
I'm dead!

5332
03:13:09,740 --> 03:13:10,780
I'm dead!

5333
03:13:11,300 --> 03:13:13,000
Don't worry, I'm coming back.

5334
03:13:16,500 --> 03:13:17,360
There you go.

5335
03:13:19,000 --> 03:13:20,160
You wanna watch this?

5336
03:13:20,420 --> 03:13:21,200
Look at me go.

5337
03:13:21,300 --> 03:13:22,400
I'm a beautiful butterfly.

5338
03:13:26,320 --> 03:13:29,020
That was not beautiful.

5339
03:13:30,960 --> 03:13:31,740
Go big.

5340
03:13:34,320 --> 03:13:35,520
There you go.

5341
03:13:36,020 --> 03:13:37,480
Ew, the noise he made.

5342
03:13:38,600 --> 03:13:39,560
What the fuck do you mean?

5343
03:13:40,440 --> 03:13:41,800
He went, errrr.

5344
03:13:42,500 --> 03:13:43,760
I went big.

5345
03:13:44,860 --> 03:13:46,380
How do I get over to you?

5346
03:13:46,540 --> 03:13:47,700
Go big again, I think.

5347
03:13:51,240 --> 03:13:51,900
I'm checking.

5348
03:13:52,100 --> 03:13:52,820
I'm big.

5349
03:13:53,600 --> 03:13:54,700
Can you not jump on?

5350
03:13:55,600 --> 03:13:56,240
Jump where?

5351
03:13:57,100 --> 03:13:58,100
I can't jump anywhere.

5352
03:13:59,220 --> 03:14:00,080
Can I?

5353
03:14:00,240 --> 03:14:01,020
Because I lower it.

5354
03:14:01,560 --> 03:14:02,580
I don't think I can.

5355
03:14:03,020 --> 03:14:03,920
Oh, go tiny.

5356
03:14:04,020 --> 03:14:04,320
Go tiny.

5357
03:14:04,400 --> 03:14:04,760
Real quick.

5358
03:14:07,380 --> 03:14:07,820
Yeah?

5359
03:14:08,060 --> 03:14:08,400
No.

5360
03:14:10,780 --> 03:14:11,560
Wait, you go...

5361
03:14:11,560 --> 03:14:11,680
Oh, I know.

5362
03:14:11,760 --> 03:14:12,460
Wait, hold on.

5363
03:14:12,600 --> 03:14:14,020
Go on the other side.

5364
03:14:14,420 --> 03:14:15,120
Other side.

5365
03:14:15,600 --> 03:14:16,080
Okay.

5366
03:14:16,360 --> 03:14:17,800
Yeah, and then I jump down.

5367
03:14:19,520 --> 03:14:20,000
Oh!

5368
03:14:20,380 --> 03:14:21,880
And then you go big.

5369
03:14:21,880 --> 03:14:22,600
And then I go big.

5370
03:14:22,940 --> 03:14:23,320
Yeah.

5371
03:14:24,420 --> 03:14:25,900
And then I go small.

5372
03:14:26,540 --> 03:14:27,760
I go mega small.

5373
03:14:30,680 --> 03:14:32,100
Oh my god, we're doing it.

5374
03:14:32,160 --> 03:14:34,640
We're using our... We're putting our two brains together.

5375
03:14:34,840 --> 03:14:36,320
To make one full brain.

5376
03:14:36,320 --> 03:14:37,360
Hmm...

5377
03:14:38,300 --> 03:14:40,080
Um, I would say...

5378
03:14:40,080 --> 03:14:42,240
I have about 75%.

5379
03:14:42,240 --> 03:14:43,200
What?

5380
03:14:44,080 --> 03:14:46,800
What happened to the other percent of that brain then?

5381
03:14:47,100 --> 03:14:47,500
What?

5382
03:14:47,920 --> 03:14:49,120
You're at a 25%.

5383
03:14:52,060 --> 03:14:53,100
Okay, nice.

5384
03:14:54,000 --> 03:14:54,640
Yes!

5385
03:14:56,140 --> 03:14:56,780
Whoops.

5386
03:14:57,060 --> 03:14:57,880
I still died.

5387
03:14:58,760 --> 03:15:00,700
You have to win for me!

5388
03:15:05,840 --> 03:15:07,480
I still died!

5389
03:15:07,960 --> 03:15:09,200
I still died!

5390
03:15:09,200 --> 03:15:10,080
Okay, you have to go first.

5391
03:15:10,640 --> 03:15:11,960
Okay, I got it.

5392
03:15:15,500 --> 03:15:16,720
You have to go first!

5393
03:15:16,800 --> 03:15:17,460
You have to go first!

5394
03:15:17,640 --> 03:15:18,200
You have to go first!

5395
03:15:18,200 --> 03:15:19,440
You didn't win for me to go first!

5396
03:15:19,780 --> 03:15:22,140
No, I wasn't looking!

5397
03:15:25,840 --> 03:15:27,680
I can't use my eyes!

5398
03:15:27,680 --> 03:15:28,460
I'm blind!

5399
03:15:29,900 --> 03:15:30,680
I can't use my eyes!

5400
03:15:30,680 --> 03:15:30,900
I'm blind!

5401
03:15:32,280 --> 03:15:34,700
I need my context clues!

5402
03:15:38,600 --> 03:15:39,640
Okay, see?

5403
03:15:40,800 --> 03:15:43,240
If we work as a team, things will get easier.

5404
03:15:45,920 --> 03:15:47,340
I don't know if you know that.

5405
03:15:48,640 --> 03:15:49,920
You're pissing me off.

5406
03:15:51,560 --> 03:15:54,880
Look, we can do this together.

5407
03:15:56,180 --> 03:15:57,160
Like a team.

5408
03:15:58,240 --> 03:15:59,500
I'm already here.

5409
03:16:00,680 --> 03:16:01,900
I let you... ladies first!

5410
03:16:04,460 --> 03:16:05,420
Ladies first!

5411
03:16:06,080 --> 03:16:07,200
Alright, I'm pushing it in.

5412
03:16:07,800 --> 03:16:08,440
Alright.

5413
03:16:11,280 --> 03:16:12,340
Playing a little music.

5414
03:16:12,940 --> 03:16:13,360
Ooh!

5415
03:16:14,320 --> 03:16:14,960
Nice.

5416
03:16:15,520 --> 03:16:16,420
In we go.

5417
03:16:21,770 --> 03:16:24,490
Stop fighting your tier and chat apart.

5418
03:16:24,830 --> 03:16:25,250
Oh!

5419
03:16:35,330 --> 03:16:36,130
Whoa, whoa!

5420
03:16:37,350 --> 03:16:37,810
What's this?

5421
03:16:38,030 --> 03:16:38,970
Oh, look at the boxes!

5422
03:16:40,630 --> 03:16:41,390
Big time!

5423
03:16:43,350 --> 03:16:43,730
Big!

5424
03:16:45,470 --> 03:16:45,850
Oh!

5425
03:16:48,170 --> 03:16:48,950
I went big.

5426
03:16:50,170 --> 03:16:52,030
Oh wait, you have to get below.

5427
03:16:52,910 --> 03:16:53,890
On the other side?

5428
03:16:57,570 --> 03:16:58,850
Because, like, look below me.

5429
03:17:02,390 --> 03:17:04,050
What do we have to do here?

5430
03:17:04,170 --> 03:17:04,570
Wait, there's something.

5431
03:17:04,570 --> 03:17:05,570
I see it, I see it.

5432
03:17:05,650 --> 03:17:06,790
There's like stuff here too.

5433
03:17:10,170 --> 03:17:11,170
What's over here?

5434
03:17:11,930 --> 03:17:13,970
Oh, do we have to grab all these little things?

5435
03:17:16,390 --> 03:17:16,870
Yeah.

5436
03:17:16,970 --> 03:17:17,190
Ow!

5437
03:17:17,330 --> 03:17:18,450
Okay, I figured it out.

5438
03:17:19,350 --> 03:17:21,490
We have to grab all these tiny things.

5439
03:17:25,620 --> 03:17:26,580
I'm heading higher.

5440
03:17:28,460 --> 03:17:30,440
Higher before anybody else.

5441
03:17:32,620 --> 03:17:33,100
Oh!

5442
03:17:33,100 --> 03:17:33,460
Boop!

5443
03:17:34,520 --> 03:17:35,080
Boop!

5444
03:17:36,760 --> 03:17:38,100
Can I get big?

5445
03:17:40,040 --> 03:17:41,380
Grow up, get this out.

5446
03:17:44,820 --> 03:17:46,200
I can't get big though.

5447
03:17:49,220 --> 03:17:50,680
What do I do from here?

5448
03:17:51,760 --> 03:17:52,820
A feed time?

5449
03:17:53,060 --> 03:17:53,600
Oh, I can!

5450
03:17:55,420 --> 03:17:56,280
I'm glad.

5451
03:17:56,540 --> 03:17:57,580
I did it!

5452
03:17:57,960 --> 03:17:59,260
I did it!

5453
03:17:59,340 --> 03:17:59,980
I got one!

5454
03:18:00,500 --> 03:18:01,600
I did it!

5455
03:18:02,460 --> 03:18:02,940
Nice!

5456
03:18:03,220 --> 03:18:04,640
I got the second one.

5457
03:18:06,780 --> 03:18:08,260
Okay, and then...

5458
03:18:08,260 --> 03:18:10,400
Do I need to put this closer?

5459
03:18:11,560 --> 03:18:12,260
There you go.

5460
03:18:12,420 --> 03:18:13,200
I got one.

5461
03:18:15,300 --> 03:18:17,640
And then the next one is yours here.

5462
03:18:20,860 --> 03:18:22,380
That's the last one, I think?

5463
03:18:22,480 --> 03:18:23,320
Unless there's more?

5464
03:18:23,660 --> 03:18:24,640
No, there's one more.

5465
03:18:25,880 --> 03:18:27,880
Oh, the last one's like above here.

5466
03:18:28,900 --> 03:18:29,960
How do we do this?

5467
03:18:29,980 --> 03:18:30,500
Oh.

5468
03:18:31,800 --> 03:18:33,280
Oh, there's a tiny one here.

5469
03:18:35,700 --> 03:18:36,220
Oh!

5470
03:18:36,840 --> 03:18:38,480
I need you for the last one.

5471
03:18:40,020 --> 03:18:42,040
I'm gonna figure out what to do for this one.

5472
03:18:43,380 --> 03:18:44,800
Because it's inside this.

5473
03:18:51,500 --> 03:18:53,300
There's like boxes to your left.

5474
03:18:55,420 --> 03:18:56,580
Yeah, no, that...

5475
03:18:56,580 --> 03:18:57,420
I already got that one.

5476
03:18:57,760 --> 03:18:58,120
Oh.

5477
03:18:58,660 --> 03:18:59,520
I'm confused.

5478
03:18:59,520 --> 03:18:59,880
I'm confused.

5479
03:19:02,480 --> 03:19:02,920
Oh!

5480
03:19:03,140 --> 03:19:04,320
I have to stop at the button!

5481
03:19:04,620 --> 03:19:05,780
That's what the button's for!

5482
03:19:06,560 --> 03:19:06,640
Oh.

5483
03:19:07,960 --> 03:19:08,400
Big!

5484
03:19:10,400 --> 03:19:11,560
Okay, and then...

5485
03:19:12,600 --> 03:19:13,040
Big!

5486
03:19:13,940 --> 03:19:14,760
There we go.

5487
03:19:15,120 --> 03:19:16,580
I already forgot about the button.

5488
03:19:18,020 --> 03:19:20,240
Yeah, I didn't see anything on my side.

5489
03:19:22,000 --> 03:19:23,560
Can you put it on the pillow?

5490
03:19:23,900 --> 03:19:24,280
Can you put it on the pillow?

5491
03:19:25,780 --> 03:19:27,140
Alright, now we have to do this one.

5492
03:19:27,140 --> 03:19:28,520
The final one up here.

5493
03:19:30,820 --> 03:19:32,880
Alright, I need you to take me to the other side.

5494
03:19:32,980 --> 03:19:34,260
I'm shrunk now.

5495
03:19:36,040 --> 03:19:36,760
I'm baby.

5496
03:19:37,660 --> 03:19:38,140
Baby!

5497
03:19:40,240 --> 03:19:41,000
Baby time!

5498
03:19:43,820 --> 03:19:44,300
Okay.

5499
03:19:47,480 --> 03:19:48,340
I'm going up.

5500
03:19:48,540 --> 03:19:49,440
I'm going up.

5501
03:19:49,580 --> 03:19:51,040
Where is it gonna take me?

5502
03:19:51,580 --> 03:19:52,580
I'll never know.

5503
03:19:53,740 --> 03:19:54,220
Oh!

5504
03:19:54,940 --> 03:19:56,200
Oh, I almost dropped off.

5505
03:19:56,760 --> 03:19:57,900
I got the last one!

5506
03:19:58,280 --> 03:19:59,260
I did it!

5507
03:19:59,920 --> 03:20:01,400
I'm a hero, Gumi!

5508
03:20:05,570 --> 03:20:06,390
I'm a hero!

5509
03:20:11,230 --> 03:20:13,010
Obviously, we need to put this one over here.

5510
03:20:15,990 --> 03:20:17,610
Are you making them further apart?

5511
03:20:19,130 --> 03:20:19,610
Yeah.

5512
03:20:20,350 --> 03:20:21,430
Wait, I can help!

5513
03:20:25,550 --> 03:20:26,030
Okay.

5514
03:20:26,090 --> 03:20:26,810
And then...

5515
03:20:27,770 --> 03:20:28,250
Here.

5516
03:20:30,430 --> 03:20:30,830
And...

5517
03:20:33,350 --> 03:20:34,610
I'm gonna put this here.

5518
03:20:39,460 --> 03:20:40,700
Are we missing one?

5519
03:20:42,260 --> 03:20:42,880
No, right?

5520
03:20:46,410 --> 03:20:47,850
We got all of them, right?

5521
03:20:49,970 --> 03:20:51,290
Maybe we are missing one.

5522
03:20:54,090 --> 03:20:55,210
Oh, they said we can...

5523
03:20:55,210 --> 03:20:55,830
Oh, I know!

5524
03:20:55,890 --> 03:20:56,370
I got an idea!

5525
03:20:56,450 --> 03:20:56,830
I got an idea!

5526
03:20:56,890 --> 03:20:57,790
I got an idea!

5527
03:21:00,790 --> 03:21:01,590
We slanted.

5528
03:21:02,550 --> 03:21:03,230
Like here.

5529
03:21:03,630 --> 03:21:04,110
Oh, I got it!

5530
03:21:04,750 --> 03:21:05,770
I got an idea!

5531
03:21:05,890 --> 03:21:06,890
You need to reach this all the way up.

5532
03:21:07,350 --> 03:21:08,670
Wait, I think we can.

5533
03:21:08,850 --> 03:21:11,950
Yeah, and then we...

5534
03:21:11,950 --> 03:21:12,690
Yeah!

5535
03:21:14,070 --> 03:21:15,270
I'm so smart!

5536
03:21:15,650 --> 03:21:17,350
Look at my brain!

5537
03:21:17,730 --> 03:21:19,430
I told you!

5538
03:21:19,790 --> 03:21:22,390
This is exactly why you married me!

5539
03:21:24,330 --> 03:21:25,230
Look at that!

5540
03:21:26,070 --> 03:21:26,630
Look at that!

5541
03:21:26,630 --> 03:21:27,290
I told you.

5542
03:21:28,690 --> 03:21:30,610
I told you, Gumi.

5543
03:21:31,390 --> 03:21:33,210
I can be smart too.

5544
03:21:33,210 --> 03:21:33,730
This is true!

5545
03:21:34,110 --> 03:21:34,930
It's so true.

5546
03:21:35,290 --> 03:21:36,190
Look at that.

5547
03:21:36,590 --> 03:21:37,530
This is why I'm a catch.

5548
03:21:38,350 --> 03:21:40,630
This is exactly why I'm the catch here.

5549
03:21:40,810 --> 03:21:42,350
I'm the one that's 10 out of 10.

5550
03:21:45,950 --> 03:21:46,790
I'll press this.

5551
03:21:46,870 --> 03:21:47,870
I'll do the one here.

5552
03:21:51,110 --> 03:21:54,230
I turned everything.

5553
03:21:58,130 --> 03:21:58,610
Yeah!

5554
03:22:00,590 --> 03:22:01,070
Yeah!

5555
03:22:01,070 --> 03:22:01,090
Yeah!

5556
03:22:03,330 --> 03:22:03,810
Computer!

5557
03:22:06,410 --> 03:22:06,850
Defenses?

5558
03:22:07,350 --> 03:22:07,790
Defenses?

5559
03:22:08,090 --> 03:22:08,290
What does he mean?

5560
03:22:10,570 --> 03:22:12,230
Hold on, I'm waiting for you.

5561
03:22:12,550 --> 03:22:14,490
Oh, you didn't wait for me?

5562
03:22:17,690 --> 03:22:18,450
I'm here now.

5563
03:22:19,250 --> 03:22:20,070
What do we do here?

5564
03:22:20,270 --> 03:22:21,350
Wait for you for what?

5565
03:22:21,650 --> 03:22:22,130
I don't know.

5566
03:22:22,210 --> 03:22:23,910
Just make sure I'm here.

5567
03:22:25,810 --> 03:22:26,490
Wait, hold on.

5568
03:22:26,730 --> 03:22:27,910
We gotta swap it.

5569
03:22:29,510 --> 03:22:30,070
Oh, yeah.

5570
03:22:30,110 --> 03:22:30,530
There we go.

5571
03:22:30,850 --> 03:22:32,290
And then we swap this.

5572
03:22:34,290 --> 03:22:35,230
How do you swap?

5573
03:22:35,650 --> 03:22:37,110
Oh, from here!

5574
03:22:37,390 --> 03:22:38,110
Okay, give me a sec.

5575
03:22:39,310 --> 03:22:39,670
Wait.

5576
03:22:40,410 --> 03:22:41,550
Wait, I can't swap this.

5577
03:22:42,970 --> 03:22:43,330
Oh!

5578
03:22:44,210 --> 03:22:44,930
No, no, no.

5579
03:22:45,190 --> 03:22:45,730
Come here.

5580
03:22:47,670 --> 03:22:48,430
Come here, come here.

5581
03:22:49,190 --> 03:22:49,930
No, no, no.

5582
03:22:50,430 --> 03:22:51,890
Go stand on the one to the left.

5583
03:22:52,890 --> 03:22:53,250
No.

5584
03:22:54,890 --> 03:22:55,510
I'm thinking.

5585
03:22:55,650 --> 03:22:56,550
So you're gonna lock it.

5586
03:22:57,950 --> 03:22:58,590
I'm thinking.

5587
03:22:59,930 --> 03:23:00,970
Oh my god!

5588
03:23:01,090 --> 03:23:01,970
We're so smart!

5589
03:23:01,970 --> 03:23:02,070
We're so smart!

5590
03:23:04,230 --> 03:23:04,750
Nice!

5591
03:23:05,070 --> 03:23:06,370
I knew I could figure it out.

5592
03:23:06,630 --> 03:23:07,690
We did it!

5593
03:23:07,790 --> 03:23:08,310
Together!

5594
03:23:09,710 --> 03:23:11,650
Alright, Dr. Hachine.

5595
03:23:12,130 --> 03:23:14,850
I see the current isn't making it through.

5596
03:23:15,190 --> 03:23:15,750
I see the current isn't making it through.

5597
03:23:15,750 --> 03:23:17,270
Can you go tiny and then wall jump up?

5598
03:23:17,390 --> 03:23:17,670
Yeah.

5599
03:23:18,330 --> 03:23:19,250
I'm doing it.

5600
03:23:20,130 --> 03:23:21,750
Boom, boom, boom.

5601
03:23:22,050 --> 03:23:23,590
And then I'm plugging it in.

5602
03:23:23,870 --> 03:23:24,490
It's in.

5603
03:23:29,620 --> 03:23:30,660
Overall happiness?

5604
03:23:31,020 --> 03:23:32,660
Happy, neutral, sad?

5605
03:23:32,820 --> 03:23:32,880
What?

5606
03:23:33,920 --> 03:23:34,120
Freak!

5607
03:23:34,120 --> 03:23:34,840
This guy's a freak.

5608
03:23:34,880 --> 03:23:37,320
Why is she monitoring our child?

5609
03:23:38,300 --> 03:23:38,840
Like...

5610
03:23:40,240 --> 03:23:41,860
Daily mood change.

5611
03:23:42,200 --> 03:23:43,780
She could be going through puberty!

5612
03:23:43,980 --> 03:23:44,880
You don't know that!

5613
03:23:45,800 --> 03:23:48,880
Puberty makes boys and girls do crazy things.

5614
03:23:49,200 --> 03:23:50,680
She could be a tween.

5615
03:23:51,640 --> 03:23:52,180
Yeah.

5616
03:23:52,920 --> 03:23:54,900
Yeah, still super creepy.

5617
03:23:55,440 --> 03:23:56,720
Hey, what does this do?

5618
03:23:56,820 --> 03:23:57,320
I agree.

5619
03:23:57,520 --> 03:23:58,620
Super fucking creepy.

5620
03:23:59,720 --> 03:24:01,220
The laugh tracker!

5621
03:24:02,380 --> 03:24:03,860
Dude, ours would be awesome.

5622
03:24:03,920 --> 03:24:05,480
I would be out of the fucking tracker, man.

5623
03:24:05,540 --> 03:24:06,660
I could break the chart.

5624
03:24:15,320 --> 03:24:16,780
Oh my god!

5625
03:24:18,380 --> 03:24:19,880
She's just like us for real.

5626
03:24:21,660 --> 03:24:23,640
Yeah, he's not a licensed therapist.

5627
03:24:24,160 --> 03:24:24,760
Exactly.

5628
03:24:25,200 --> 03:24:25,900
Where's his degree?

5629
03:24:30,480 --> 03:24:31,080
Oh?

5630
03:24:34,200 --> 03:24:35,440
Where is that taking us?

5631
03:24:39,400 --> 03:24:41,420
Oh, this is a gladiator.

5632
03:24:41,440 --> 03:24:41,560
I think it's a bus fight.

5633
03:24:41,600 --> 03:24:42,780
Yeah, this is a stadium.

5634
03:24:43,600 --> 03:24:45,200
This is a gladiator stadium.

5635
03:24:47,540 --> 03:24:48,880
Okay, how do we do this?

5636
03:24:51,080 --> 03:24:53,220
Oh, there's like red buttons here.

5637
03:24:56,460 --> 03:24:57,220
That's on you.

5638
03:25:04,960 --> 03:25:05,780
I'm trying!

5639
03:25:05,980 --> 03:25:06,420
I'm trying!

5640
03:25:06,420 --> 03:25:06,500
I'm trying!

5641
03:25:07,180 --> 03:25:07,660
I'm trying!

5642
03:25:07,660 --> 03:25:09,020
I need you to grab this!

5643
03:25:09,140 --> 03:25:10,360
I need you to grab this!

5644
03:25:13,360 --> 03:25:13,800
Nice.

5645
03:25:13,960 --> 03:25:14,200
See?

5646
03:25:14,860 --> 03:25:15,880
I did it.

5647
03:25:16,180 --> 03:25:17,280
I did something.

5648
03:25:20,440 --> 03:25:21,400
And we just jump.

5649
03:25:21,560 --> 03:25:22,720
We don't have to go anywhere.

5650
03:25:25,320 --> 03:25:26,200
The point...

5651
03:25:30,660 --> 03:25:33,000
Hey, Goomy, I don't think you should just stand still, Goomy.

5652
03:25:33,100 --> 03:25:33,560
I'm just saying.

5653
03:25:34,940 --> 03:25:35,380
Yeah.

5654
03:25:36,260 --> 03:25:37,880
You were like, I don't think we have to go anywhere.

5655
03:25:37,980 --> 03:25:39,780
So I was like, okay, I'm gonna zone out for a second.

5656
03:25:41,120 --> 03:25:41,980
I need help!

5657
03:25:42,520 --> 03:25:43,420
I need help!

5658
03:25:43,420 --> 03:25:44,020
Get down!

5659
03:25:45,260 --> 03:25:46,800
And it broke towards me!

5660
03:25:49,500 --> 03:25:50,380
I am coming!

5661
03:25:50,500 --> 03:25:50,820
I'm coming!

5662
03:25:51,180 --> 03:25:51,620
We

5663
03:25:56,540 --> 03:25:57,900
did it!

5664
03:26:01,400 --> 03:26:02,240
So easy.

5665
03:26:03,240 --> 03:26:03,880
Come on.

5666
03:26:03,900 --> 03:26:05,540
Make this a little more difficult.

5667
03:26:05,980 --> 03:26:07,160
This is so easy.

5668
03:26:09,140 --> 03:26:10,860
Yes, aim at Goomy and not me.

5669
03:26:13,260 --> 03:26:14,260
Look at that dodge.

5670
03:26:15,020 --> 03:26:15,340
Ow.

5671
03:26:17,420 --> 03:26:18,360
It's okay, I have regen.

5672
03:26:18,920 --> 03:26:19,460
It's on you!

5673
03:26:19,580 --> 03:26:19,900
It's on you!

5674
03:26:19,920 --> 03:26:20,540
It's on you!

5675
03:26:20,780 --> 03:26:22,740
Where is the...

5676
03:26:23,200 --> 03:26:23,820
But it's over here!

5677
03:26:23,860 --> 03:26:24,400
But it's over here!

5678
03:26:24,460 --> 03:26:24,980
But it's over here!

5679
03:26:25,040 --> 03:26:25,220
On me!

5680
03:26:25,360 --> 03:26:25,440
On me!

5681
03:26:25,520 --> 03:26:25,720
On me!

5682
03:26:25,720 --> 03:26:25,900
On me!

5683
03:26:30,580 --> 03:26:31,440
You have to jump!

5684
03:26:32,420 --> 03:26:32,740
You have to jump!

5685
03:26:32,740 --> 03:26:33,020
You have to...

5686
03:26:33,020 --> 03:26:35,780
I have to walk up a wall, man, not jump!

5687
03:26:39,340 --> 03:26:40,060
This is it!

5688
03:26:40,140 --> 03:26:40,940
Come over here!

5689
03:26:41,020 --> 03:26:41,540
Come over here!

5690
03:26:42,100 --> 03:26:43,760
We've got to get rid of that laser!

5691
03:26:46,080 --> 03:26:47,000
I'm doing it!

5692
03:26:48,280 --> 03:26:49,500
What am I doing?

5693
03:26:52,820 --> 03:26:53,720
I'm doing it!

5694
03:26:53,720 --> 03:26:54,240
What am I doing?

5695
03:26:54,240 --> 03:26:54,700
What am I doing?

5696
03:26:54,920 --> 03:26:55,500
You get the laser!

5697
03:26:59,980 --> 03:27:01,640
Don't touch things down there!

5698
03:27:02,080 --> 03:27:02,980
Nice, we did it.

5699
03:27:03,040 --> 03:27:03,180
See?

5700
03:27:03,320 --> 03:27:04,560
That was so hard.

5701
03:27:05,680 --> 03:27:07,020
Wait, if I was tiny...

5702
03:27:07,020 --> 03:27:09,300
If I'm mega tiny, they can't kill me.

5703
03:27:09,300 --> 03:27:10,380
Where am I?

5704
03:27:11,220 --> 03:27:12,020
I'm dead.

5705
03:27:12,960 --> 03:27:14,420
Don't die yet!

5706
03:27:16,920 --> 03:27:19,800
I figured out that you should not be tiny!

5707
03:27:20,060 --> 03:27:21,100
Don't be tiny!

5708
03:27:21,860 --> 03:27:23,340
Don't be tiny!

5709
03:27:24,360 --> 03:27:25,720
What the fuck?

5710
03:27:28,900 --> 03:27:30,440
Oh my gosh.

5711
03:27:30,520 --> 03:27:31,380
Don't worry it.

5712
03:27:31,940 --> 03:27:34,720
How do we do this?

5713
03:27:34,980 --> 03:27:36,100
How do we do this?

5714
03:27:37,700 --> 03:27:39,060
You dodged!

5715
03:27:39,080 --> 03:27:41,160
You dodged the fucking rocket, man!

5716
03:27:41,740 --> 03:27:43,520
Oh my gosh, it didn't work!

5717
03:27:44,660 --> 03:27:46,180
What is that?

5718
03:27:48,380 --> 03:27:49,740
What is that?

5719
03:27:49,740 --> 03:27:50,580
I can't...

5720
03:27:51,320 --> 03:27:52,680
It's so hard.

5721
03:27:52,740 --> 03:27:53,460
It's so difficult.

5722
03:27:53,900 --> 03:27:55,240
I can't dodge.

5723
03:27:55,460 --> 03:27:56,100
I'm too stupid.

5724
03:27:58,300 --> 03:27:59,360
I didn't dodge!

5725
03:27:59,360 --> 03:28:01,920
Okay, you ride the rocket and then you try...

5726
03:28:01,920 --> 03:28:03,140
I didn't dodge!

5727
03:28:03,140 --> 03:28:04,100
I didn't dodge!

5728
03:28:09,180 --> 03:28:11,200
I'm doing my best.

5729
03:28:11,500 --> 03:28:12,840
I'm doing my best.

5730
03:28:12,840 --> 03:28:12,880
I'm doing my best.

5731
03:28:14,200 --> 03:28:15,680
I figured it out!

5732
03:28:15,780 --> 03:28:16,480
I figured it out!

5733
03:28:16,940 --> 03:28:18,600
Look, look, look!

5734
03:28:19,020 --> 03:28:19,460
Look!

5735
03:28:24,810 --> 03:28:26,130
We did it!

5736
03:28:26,210 --> 03:28:26,450
Yay!

5737
03:28:30,770 --> 03:28:31,330
We did it!

5738
03:28:31,330 --> 03:28:31,830
Wait, get in the ship!

5739
03:28:31,930 --> 03:28:32,390
Get in the ship!

5740
03:28:32,610 --> 03:28:33,490
Right here, go tiny!

5741
03:28:33,750 --> 03:28:34,850
I'm tiny, I'm tiny!

5742
03:28:36,750 --> 03:28:37,310
I'm in!

5743
03:28:38,150 --> 03:28:39,510
No more games!

5744
03:28:39,710 --> 03:28:40,690
What do I do?

5745
03:28:41,750 --> 03:28:42,910
Oh no, man.

5746
03:28:43,330 --> 03:28:45,810
Computer, computer, remove all limiters!

5747
03:28:45,990 --> 03:28:47,570
Oh my god, he's removing all limiters!

5748
03:28:48,910 --> 03:28:49,630
Don't worry!

5749
03:28:50,410 --> 03:28:51,310
Stop it!

5750
03:28:51,810 --> 03:28:53,510
Don't die, please don't die!

5751
03:28:53,570 --> 03:28:54,130
How did you die?

5752
03:28:57,330 --> 03:28:58,870
I wasn't patient!

5753
03:28:59,170 --> 03:29:00,390
I wasn't patient!

5754
03:29:00,690 --> 03:29:02,570
Is that what you want me to say?

5755
03:29:03,490 --> 03:29:04,050
Doki!

5756
03:29:04,790 --> 03:29:07,030
I have so much I have to dodge!

5757
03:29:07,390 --> 03:29:08,130
It's okay!

5758
03:29:08,150 --> 03:29:09,770
It's okay, I'm not dying!

5759
03:29:12,610 --> 03:29:14,510
It's okay, I'm not dying this time!

5760
03:29:16,330 --> 03:29:16,930
I'm there!

5761
03:29:17,190 --> 03:29:18,390
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here!

5762
03:29:20,170 --> 03:29:20,730
What's this?

5763
03:29:21,610 --> 03:29:22,130
I'm here!

5764
03:29:23,110 --> 03:29:24,230
Just keep dodging!

5765
03:29:27,610 --> 03:29:28,390
Look, I'm here!

5766
03:29:29,870 --> 03:29:30,990
I can't look!

5767
03:29:33,770 --> 03:29:34,750
I'm almost there!

5768
03:29:34,970 --> 03:29:35,930
I'm almost there!

5769
03:29:36,770 --> 03:29:38,130
Don't die, don't die, I'm dying!

5770
03:29:41,960 --> 03:29:43,580
You're so good at that though!

5771
03:29:43,700 --> 03:29:44,760
You're so good at that!

5772
03:29:44,820 --> 03:29:46,480
It's the whole pomo party, did you say?

5773
03:29:48,680 --> 03:29:51,000
I thought you were really good at it!

5774
03:29:51,620 --> 03:29:52,800
I am really good!

5775
03:29:52,800 --> 03:29:54,740
That's why I've been lasting so long!

5776
03:29:54,820 --> 03:29:55,940
I've died three times!

5777
03:29:56,740 --> 03:29:58,180
I was confused!

5778
03:29:58,560 --> 03:29:59,180
I was confused!

5779
03:29:59,500 --> 03:30:01,800
He makes broken bikes on the path, Doki!

5780
03:30:03,280 --> 03:30:05,220
I was so confused!

5781
03:30:06,120 --> 03:30:08,000
I was so confused!

5782
03:30:08,640 --> 03:30:08,660
DOKI!

5783
03:30:08,660 --> 03:30:10,220
I'm running out of space!

5784
03:30:11,420 --> 03:30:12,940
I'm running out of space!

5785
03:30:16,860 --> 03:30:18,180
I'm almost there!

5786
03:30:18,320 --> 03:30:19,260
I'm almost there!

5787
03:30:19,760 --> 03:30:20,680
Don't worry!

5788
03:30:21,780 --> 03:30:22,960
I'm almost there!

5789
03:30:26,440 --> 03:30:27,680
Don't worry, Gumi!

5790
03:30:27,700 --> 03:30:28,640
I'm almost there, Gumi!

5791
03:30:29,160 --> 03:30:30,280
I'm almost there!

5792
03:30:32,640 --> 03:30:34,100
You got this, Gumi!

5793
03:30:34,580 --> 03:30:35,580
You got this!

5794
03:30:36,700 --> 03:30:37,900
I'm so good at this!

5795
03:30:38,660 --> 03:30:39,820
You fucking bitch!

5796
03:30:57,160 --> 03:30:59,100
I'm going to save you!

5797
03:31:01,330 --> 03:31:03,210
What about the pinball?

5798
03:31:09,430 --> 03:31:10,570
Trust me.

5799
03:31:10,670 --> 03:31:12,230
Yes, trust me, Gumi.

5800
03:31:12,230 --> 03:31:13,550
We keep trusting me.

5801
03:31:19,990 --> 03:31:20,910
I'm the shooter!

5802
03:31:21,070 --> 03:31:21,470
I'm the shooter!

5803
03:31:26,070 --> 03:31:26,790
Where is he?

5804
03:31:26,910 --> 03:31:27,310
Where is he?

5805
03:31:42,170 --> 03:31:48,690
I thought you don't believe in screen peeking.

5806
03:31:50,130 --> 03:31:50,870
This game happened.

5807
03:31:54,270 --> 03:31:55,410
Where is he?

5808
03:31:55,550 --> 03:31:56,070
Oh there he is.

5809
03:31:56,270 --> 03:31:56,730
Oh wait.

5810
03:31:57,810 --> 03:31:58,710
No I didn't!

5811
03:31:58,810 --> 03:31:59,390
Wait what?

5812
03:32:01,410 --> 03:32:02,710
How did I miss?

5813
03:32:05,530 --> 03:32:06,010
Okay.

5814
03:32:06,470 --> 03:32:07,470
One last one.

5815
03:32:09,410 --> 03:32:11,230
Oh he's so close this time!

5816
03:32:17,120 --> 03:32:18,080
We did it!

5817
03:32:18,160 --> 03:32:19,280
We're such a good team!

5818
03:32:21,360 --> 03:32:23,020
We're such a good team!

5819
03:32:24,140 --> 03:32:25,800
How do we get back to Rose?

5820
03:32:26,320 --> 03:32:27,860
I can't let you harm her.

5821
03:32:28,700 --> 03:32:29,940
I'm her best friend!

5822
03:32:30,380 --> 03:32:30,820
Awwww.

5823
03:32:33,540 --> 03:32:34,820
We're an asshole!

5824
03:32:35,280 --> 03:32:35,720
We're an asshole!

5825
03:32:36,060 --> 03:32:37,140
We're an asshole!

5826
03:32:37,780 --> 03:32:38,900
I'm not an asshole!

5827
03:32:39,160 --> 03:32:40,580
I just know what's good for our daughter.

5828
03:32:41,340 --> 03:32:42,480
I'm gonna close my blinds.

5829
03:32:42,480 --> 03:32:43,240
The sun's in my eye.

5830
03:32:43,440 --> 03:32:45,680
I can ask Rose to play with you again.

5831
03:32:46,140 --> 03:32:48,480
But you have to help us get back to her.

5832
03:32:52,280 --> 03:32:52,720
Okay.

5833
03:32:52,720 --> 03:32:53,300
I'm back.

5834
03:32:53,320 --> 03:32:54,380
Is the monkey dead yet?

5835
03:32:55,700 --> 03:32:56,720
No man.

5836
03:32:56,960 --> 03:32:58,380
You won't make her cry.

5837
03:32:58,940 --> 03:32:59,720
Yeah yeah yeah.

5838
03:32:59,800 --> 03:33:00,300
We promise.

5839
03:33:00,600 --> 03:33:02,680
Of course we will never do that again.

5840
03:33:02,820 --> 03:33:03,940
Dude you're such a ghastly!

5841
03:33:04,640 --> 03:33:10,060
I like how... Oh my god so it's Deadpool super chat was like it's like Harambe all over again.

5842
03:33:10,180 --> 03:33:10,420
No!

5843
03:33:17,740 --> 03:33:18,740
There she is!

5844
03:33:19,300 --> 03:33:19,820
Rose!

5845
03:33:21,440 --> 03:33:21,960
Sweetie!

5846
03:33:23,720 --> 03:33:24,240
Darling!

5847
03:33:24,240 --> 03:33:24,760
Look!

5848
03:33:24,760 --> 03:33:26,540
This might look strange but it's us!

5849
03:33:26,780 --> 03:33:27,720
It's mom and dad!

5850
03:33:28,040 --> 03:33:28,560
Rose!

5851
03:33:28,920 --> 03:33:30,180
We need your help!

5852
03:33:31,540 --> 03:33:32,060
Look!

5853
03:33:32,540 --> 03:33:33,600
Rose it's us!

5854
03:33:34,080 --> 03:33:35,560
Oh my god why is she running?

5855
03:33:35,580 --> 03:33:37,440
Is she running her I'm running away letter?

5856
03:33:37,840 --> 03:33:38,740
She can't see us!

5857
03:33:39,820 --> 03:33:41,720
Oh my god this is like inside out.

5858
03:33:42,100 --> 03:33:43,440
We need to talk!

5859
03:33:43,840 --> 03:33:45,320
What the fuck you're hitting her!

5860
03:33:47,200 --> 03:33:47,720
CPS!

5861
03:33:47,900 --> 03:33:48,400
CPS!

5862
03:33:48,780 --> 03:33:49,260
CPS!

5863
03:33:49,700 --> 03:33:49,760
Darling!

5864
03:33:53,170 --> 03:33:53,460
Darling!

5865
03:33:53,790 --> 03:33:54,090
Darling!

5866
03:33:54,170 --> 03:33:56,030
Wait I can't do a British accent.

5867
03:33:56,210 --> 03:33:59,390
I was just saying if I talk in a British accent I can't do it.

5868
03:34:01,000 --> 03:34:03,090
Oh I can move like items!

5869
03:34:03,710 --> 03:34:06,550
Dude imagine she fucking thinks she's haunted now.

5870
03:34:07,830 --> 03:34:08,690
Oh shit!

5871
03:34:12,990 --> 03:34:15,290
Oh my god we're getting closer to math.

5872
03:34:19,350 --> 03:34:21,950
Oh she's gonna believe in ghosts now.

5873
03:34:24,030 --> 03:34:28,550
Let's Let's destroy something Rose loves to make her cry.

5874
03:34:28,550 --> 03:34:28,690
Whoa!

5875
03:34:30,310 --> 03:34:30,830
Goomy!

5876
03:34:31,290 --> 03:34:32,750
Rose loves her elephants.

5877
03:34:33,410 --> 03:34:34,510
It's her best friend.

5878
03:34:35,130 --> 03:34:37,110
You're gonna kill the elephant?

5879
03:34:38,130 --> 03:34:39,290
We make Rose cry.

5880
03:34:39,350 --> 03:34:39,830
Hey my bad.

5881
03:34:41,690 --> 03:34:43,330
I'll buy her a new one I promise.

5882
03:34:43,630 --> 03:34:44,090
Great idea!

5883
03:34:44,930 --> 03:34:46,210
You're enabling me!

5884
03:34:46,350 --> 03:34:48,550
Okay I'm an enabler.

5885
03:34:48,750 --> 03:34:49,030
You're enabling me!

5886
03:34:49,110 --> 03:34:50,870
Yeah I would admit.

5887
03:34:51,230 --> 03:34:52,270
I'm an enabler.

5888
03:34:52,310 --> 03:34:53,790
But you had the idea.

5889
03:34:54,030 --> 03:34:57,830
But you had the idea first.

5890
03:34:57,830 --> 03:34:57,950
But you had the idea first.

5891
03:34:58,870 --> 03:34:59,530
Oh shit you clayface.

5892
03:35:01,690 --> 03:35:02,290
Oh!

5893
03:35:06,840 --> 03:35:08,340
My nose is itching.

5894
03:35:08,600 --> 03:35:10,000
Yeah that's the dust.

5895
03:35:10,540 --> 03:35:12,520
You must remember to clean under her bed.

5896
03:35:13,700 --> 03:35:14,300
Yeah.

5897
03:35:15,880 --> 03:35:16,480
Noted.

5898
03:35:19,180 --> 03:35:20,340
Alright here we go.

5899
03:35:21,400 --> 03:35:23,200
She has so many toys.

5900
03:35:23,200 --> 03:35:24,660
Oh my god look at all her socks.

5901
03:35:25,140 --> 03:35:25,300
Yeah exactly.

5902
03:35:26,120 --> 03:35:27,820
One less would be a good thing.

5903
03:35:27,980 --> 03:35:29,100
Wait there's a game here.

5904
03:35:29,760 --> 03:35:30,220
Where?

5905
03:35:30,920 --> 03:35:32,260
We have to buy a replacement.

5906
03:35:32,260 --> 03:35:32,580
Right?

5907
03:35:32,760 --> 03:35:33,200
No.

5908
03:35:33,720 --> 03:35:34,740
Wait look at this.

5909
03:35:36,460 --> 03:35:37,840
It's time for a new frame.

5910
03:35:38,940 --> 03:35:40,220
It's my favorite number.

5911
03:35:42,040 --> 03:35:42,500
8888.

5912
03:35:43,060 --> 03:35:44,880
Lately she's gotten attached to it again.

5913
03:35:45,100 --> 03:35:46,120
I don't know why.

5914
03:35:46,900 --> 03:35:47,360
Oh!

5915
03:35:47,860 --> 03:35:50,560
Wait was there an easter egg over on the left then?

5916
03:35:51,480 --> 03:35:52,520
I don't know I'll watch.

5917
03:35:53,620 --> 03:35:54,620
Alright give me a sec.

5918
03:35:54,640 --> 03:35:55,100
Oh look a little car!

5919
03:35:55,360 --> 03:35:55,960
Drive the car!

5920
03:35:56,340 --> 03:35:56,880
Oh there is!

5921
03:35:58,360 --> 03:35:59,720
There is a little car.

5922
03:36:01,160 --> 03:36:01,600
Oh.

5923
03:36:01,900 --> 03:36:04,620
I think I have to push you.

5924
03:36:04,880 --> 03:36:06,700
Yeah but is there like...

5925
03:36:06,700 --> 03:36:08,020
Do we have to do any of this?

5926
03:36:08,820 --> 03:36:09,860
There's a rodeo!

5927
03:36:10,140 --> 03:36:10,720
Wait come back!

5928
03:36:13,680 --> 03:36:14,560
Yeah just...

5929
03:36:15,160 --> 03:36:16,560
Oh I have to take you back.

5930
03:36:16,660 --> 03:36:16,680
Hold 8!

5931
03:36:16,800 --> 03:36:17,120
Hold 8!

5932
03:36:17,220 --> 03:36:17,620
Hold 8!

5933
03:36:17,780 --> 03:36:18,660
Yeah I'm coming back.

5934
03:36:18,700 --> 03:36:19,140
I'm coming back.

5935
03:36:19,360 --> 03:36:21,680
Oh the game was like behind us.

5936
03:36:23,200 --> 03:36:24,100
That was the main area.

5937
03:36:24,260 --> 03:36:25,320
Alright hold 8.

5938
03:36:34,000 --> 03:36:34,540
Oh!

5939
03:36:34,580 --> 03:36:37,020
Sorry I sneezed.

5940
03:36:38,540 --> 03:36:39,080
What?

5941
03:36:42,280 --> 03:36:43,000
There you go.

5942
03:36:43,040 --> 03:36:43,640
So you made it!

5943
03:36:47,510 --> 03:36:48,050
Oh!

5944
03:36:49,170 --> 03:36:50,150
Did you crash?

5945
03:36:50,610 --> 03:36:51,510
I'm stuck here.

5946
03:36:53,450 --> 03:36:55,560
I did it every time.

5947
03:36:55,970 --> 03:36:56,690
Every time.

5948
03:36:56,870 --> 03:36:58,990
I did it every fucking time.

5949
03:37:03,090 --> 03:37:05,890
Don't worry I'm getting you in right now.

5950
03:37:06,050 --> 03:37:07,390
I'm getting you in.

5951
03:37:08,390 --> 03:37:09,410
You're in.

5952
03:37:10,930 --> 03:37:11,630
What?

5953
03:37:11,850 --> 03:37:13,390
I crashed again!

5954
03:37:15,770 --> 03:37:17,370
Oh my god!

5955
03:37:17,770 --> 03:37:19,390
I crashed again!

5956
03:37:19,870 --> 03:37:21,550
I crashed again!

5957
03:37:21,550 --> 03:37:21,570
Okay.

5958
03:37:22,170 --> 03:37:23,310
You're in again.

5959
03:37:23,550 --> 03:37:24,570
You're in again.

5960
03:37:28,060 --> 03:37:28,760
Alright.

5961
03:37:30,680 --> 03:37:31,800
Okay we're good.

5962
03:37:32,340 --> 03:37:33,040
Okay.

5963
03:37:33,520 --> 03:37:34,440
We're good now.

5964
03:37:37,320 --> 03:37:37,940
I'm in.

5965
03:37:40,880 --> 03:37:41,340
Okay.

5966
03:37:47,190 --> 03:37:48,210
That means we're close.

5967
03:37:48,290 --> 03:37:49,670
Yeah we're closer to the sea.

5968
03:37:51,170 --> 03:37:52,630
Alright let's go to the rodeo.

5969
03:37:53,070 --> 03:37:54,370
One less would be a good thing.

5970
03:37:55,510 --> 03:37:56,930
Wait I'm getting the car first.

5971
03:37:57,390 --> 03:37:59,150
I think the car progressed it.

5972
03:37:59,170 --> 03:37:59,590
Doesn't it?

5973
03:38:00,370 --> 03:38:02,010
Yeah we'll just get a replacement.

5974
03:38:03,030 --> 03:38:04,910
Yeah yeah it like progressed it.

5975
03:38:04,910 --> 03:38:05,550
I think you should.

5976
03:38:08,370 --> 03:38:09,010
Okay

5977
03:38:13,640 --> 03:38:15,200
let's just find it.

5978
03:38:15,540 --> 03:38:17,580
Okay let's just find it.

5979
03:38:17,580 --> 03:38:19,780
I'm ready for the rodeo.

5980
03:38:21,680 --> 03:38:23,140
I can't get out.

5981
03:38:23,240 --> 03:38:24,080
I can't get out.

5982
03:38:24,160 --> 03:38:26,720
I literally mean it.

5983
03:38:29,520 --> 03:38:31,760
What is wrong with your game?

5984
03:38:31,920 --> 03:38:33,300
What do you mean?

5985
03:38:34,160 --> 03:38:36,220
Why do you keep crashing me?

5986
03:38:36,220 --> 03:38:37,740
You couldn't get out!

5987
03:38:37,740 --> 03:38:39,340
You left the session!

5988
03:38:41,640 --> 03:38:44,240
I was able to keep honking it!

5989
03:38:44,580 --> 03:38:46,480
I was able to keep honking it!

5990
03:38:46,480 --> 03:38:48,380
You exploded on my screen!

5991
03:38:48,600 --> 03:38:48,720
You exploded on my screen!

5992
03:38:48,720 --> 03:38:49,180
What do you mean?

5993
03:38:49,700 --> 03:38:53,440
I literally saw you explode on my screen!

5994
03:38:54,780 --> 03:38:57,620
I literally saw you explode on my screen!

5995
03:38:58,160 --> 03:38:59,460
Oh my god.

5996
03:39:03,700 --> 03:39:05,560
Let's go to the fucking radio.

5997
03:39:06,340 --> 03:39:06,820
Yay!

5998
03:39:07,060 --> 03:39:08,880
The rodeo!

5999
03:39:10,200 --> 03:39:10,680
Yay!

6000
03:39:12,640 --> 03:39:13,120
Yay!

6001
03:39:14,160 --> 03:39:14,340
Yay!

6002
03:39:17,240 --> 03:39:18,200
Why don't we stop?

6003
03:39:18,280 --> 03:39:20,200
Stay on the bull as long as you can.

6004
03:39:21,040 --> 03:39:22,400
How do you do that?

6005
03:39:22,680 --> 03:39:23,280
I don't know.

6006
03:39:27,880 --> 03:39:28,360
Oh!

6007
03:39:29,060 --> 03:39:31,220
It's just a rhythm game.

6008
03:39:31,240 --> 03:39:32,120
It's just a rhythm game.

6009
03:39:33,740 --> 03:39:35,540
So I assume it gets worse right?

6010
03:39:38,220 --> 03:39:39,340
Look at me go.

6011
03:39:41,500 --> 03:39:42,360
Oh my god.

6012
03:39:42,400 --> 03:39:43,580
So fucking easy.

6013
03:39:46,820 --> 03:39:47,820
Is that not B?

6014
03:39:49,880 --> 03:39:51,360
Why do I keep crashing?

6015
03:39:52,200 --> 03:39:52,700
Why?

6016
03:39:53,960 --> 03:39:55,260
Did you crash again?

6017
03:39:55,480 --> 03:39:57,200
Why does it keep happening?

6018
03:39:57,900 --> 03:40:00,680
In one last program!

6019
03:40:01,100 --> 03:40:03,140
Okay let's just not do the rodeo.

6020
03:40:03,140 --> 03:40:04,700
Let's not do the rodeo.

6021
03:40:04,740 --> 03:40:05,540
Let's just do the rodeo.

6022
03:40:10,200 --> 03:40:11,880
Let's just progress the game.

6023
03:40:11,980 --> 03:40:13,980
Let's just progress the game.

6024
03:40:17,660 --> 03:40:19,080
It's the server!

6025
03:40:19,540 --> 03:40:21,100
Oh my god!

6026
03:40:21,720 --> 03:40:25,960
It won't even let me connect to the server anymore!

6027
03:40:27,300 --> 03:40:28,720
Excuse me.

6028
03:40:29,240 --> 03:40:31,680
I think this was a good point to stop.

6029
03:40:31,860 --> 03:40:32,400
I think...

6030
03:40:32,400 --> 03:40:33,380
I think...

6031
03:40:37,800 --> 03:40:38,640
Goofy.

6032
03:40:39,820 --> 03:40:41,080
I think...

6033
03:40:41,080 --> 03:40:43,420
I think this is a good time...

6034
03:40:43,420 --> 03:40:45,520
It's not my PC issue!

6035
03:40:45,600 --> 03:40:46,400
It's connection!

6036
03:40:47,320 --> 03:40:48,560
It's connection!

6037
03:40:50,760 --> 03:40:51,920
It's not...

6038
03:40:51,920 --> 03:40:55,040
It's not even the PC issue.

6039
03:40:55,660 --> 03:40:56,060
It's not even the PC issue.

6040
03:40:56,060 --> 03:40:56,440
You know...

6041
03:40:57,180 --> 03:40:57,760
It's okay.

6042
03:40:57,980 --> 03:41:00,720
We can finish it another time.

6043
03:41:03,060 --> 03:41:05,460
It's a server issue.

6044
03:41:05,960 --> 03:41:07,200
It's a server issue.

6045
03:41:07,220 --> 03:41:07,400
It's a server issue.

6046
03:41:07,400 --> 03:41:08,200
I think this is a good time though, Goofy.

6047
03:41:08,420 --> 03:41:13,020
I think our marriage has been quite solid so far.

6048
03:41:13,240 --> 03:41:13,780
Yeah, I know.

6049
03:41:14,000 --> 03:41:15,460
That was pretty cool.

6050
03:41:16,200 --> 03:41:17,460
It's pretty solid.

6051
03:41:19,080 --> 03:41:20,400
Did you have a great time?

6052
03:41:20,720 --> 03:41:22,080
I think I had a great time.

6053
03:41:22,820 --> 03:41:24,980
Yeah, I had an awesome time.

6054
03:41:25,260 --> 03:41:27,220
If you had to rate it out of 10...

6055
03:41:29,700 --> 03:41:31,500
Oh yeah, definitely an 8.

6056
03:41:31,780 --> 03:41:32,420
An 8?

6057
03:41:32,600 --> 03:41:34,140
Why isn't it a 9 at least?

6058
03:41:34,400 --> 03:41:36,520
What did I do that doesn't make it a 9?

6059
03:41:38,860 --> 03:41:39,760
I don't know.

6060
03:41:39,760 --> 03:41:40,220
Name one thing.

6061
03:41:40,220 --> 03:41:42,100
I remember you standing next to a button...

6062
03:41:43,120 --> 03:41:43,700
I don't remember that.

6063
03:41:43,700 --> 03:41:46,360
While I was fighting for my life against a moon baboon.

6064
03:41:46,560 --> 03:41:47,680
No, I don't remember that.

6065
03:41:47,980 --> 03:41:49,180
You don't remember that?

6066
03:41:49,460 --> 03:41:52,100
No, I don't know what you're talking about.

6067
03:41:52,780 --> 03:41:53,340
There.

6068
03:42:00,980 --> 03:42:02,100
But anyway...

6069
03:42:02,100 --> 03:42:03,200
That was fun!

6070
03:42:03,980 --> 03:42:04,540
What?

6071
03:42:07,220 --> 03:42:09,060
Did your chat know how far we are in the game?

6072
03:42:09,060 --> 03:42:10,240
How far are we, guys?

6073
03:42:10,460 --> 03:42:12,120
How far are we in this game, chat?

6074
03:42:15,580 --> 03:42:16,360
You guys know?

6075
03:42:17,480 --> 03:42:18,460
Out of how many?

6076
03:42:19,520 --> 03:42:20,560
We're at chapter 5!

6077
03:42:20,720 --> 03:42:21,500
Out of how many?

6078
03:42:21,560 --> 03:42:22,200
We're 50%!

6079
03:42:22,480 --> 03:42:24,600
Hold on, I see that you have a poll up.

6080
03:42:25,060 --> 03:42:26,540
Who's the reason for the divorce?

6081
03:42:26,640 --> 03:42:27,920
71% Doki.

6082
03:42:28,140 --> 03:42:28,700
No, I don't.

6083
03:42:29,940 --> 03:42:31,300
No, I don't.

6084
03:42:34,480 --> 03:42:35,580
We're at 50%!

6085
03:42:35,580 --> 03:42:37,580
Next week we're beating it.

6086
03:42:37,680 --> 03:42:39,040
We're beating it next week.

6087
03:42:39,640 --> 03:42:40,580
Give me a day.

6088
03:42:40,780 --> 03:42:41,760
No, next week.

6089
03:42:41,820 --> 03:42:42,520
We'll figure it out.

6090
03:42:43,300 --> 03:42:45,040
Okay, but I will say...

6091
03:42:46,280 --> 03:42:47,160
I'm not...

6092
03:42:47,160 --> 03:42:47,900
Actually...

6093
03:42:49,620 --> 03:42:50,940
No, I am here next week.

6094
03:42:51,140 --> 03:42:51,640
Alright, yeah.

6095
03:42:51,720 --> 03:42:52,680
Next week we'll finish it.

6096
03:42:53,120 --> 03:42:53,560
Yeah.

6097
03:42:54,900 --> 03:42:55,780
We can do it.

6098
03:42:55,800 --> 03:42:56,980
We're like speedrunning this.

6099
03:42:57,040 --> 03:42:57,620
It's so easy.

6100
03:42:59,920 --> 03:43:01,120
Yeah, it's so easy.

6101
03:43:01,360 --> 03:43:02,260
Yeah, it's so easy.

6102
03:43:02,380 --> 03:43:03,300
I think if we...

6103
03:43:03,300 --> 03:43:05,000
cut out all the times...

6104
03:43:05,580 --> 03:43:05,880
and we like...

6105
03:43:05,880 --> 03:43:08,160
clearly were just messing about...

6106
03:43:08,820 --> 03:43:10,080
We would have been...

6107
03:43:10,080 --> 03:43:12,060
We might be like...

6108
03:43:12,600 --> 03:43:15,020
We would have been 70% done...

6109
03:43:15,020 --> 03:43:16,560
if we didn't fuck around too much.

6110
03:43:17,200 --> 03:43:19,700
If we, as a team, together...

6111
03:43:19,700 --> 03:43:21,380
didn't fuck around that much...

6112
03:43:21,380 --> 03:43:23,780
I think we would have been like 70% done.

6113
03:43:24,740 --> 03:43:26,660
Yeah, I think if we...

6114
03:43:26,660 --> 03:43:28,860
both completed the challenges...

6115
03:43:28,860 --> 03:43:30,460
as fast as we could...

6116
03:43:30,460 --> 03:43:31,780
But we were just messing around.

6117
03:43:33,440 --> 03:43:34,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6118
03:43:35,580 --> 03:43:37,840
We, as a team, were messing around...

6119
03:43:37,840 --> 03:43:38,340
together.

6120
03:43:39,400 --> 03:43:39,880
Together.

6121
03:43:42,540 --> 03:43:43,020
Anyway...

6122
03:43:43,440 --> 03:43:44,780
We're gonna call it here, guys.

6123
03:43:45,020 --> 03:43:46,340
Thank you all for coming.

6124
03:43:46,700 --> 03:43:48,320
I don't know if you're gonna call it here, Gumi.

6125
03:43:48,440 --> 03:43:50,420
I think you're gonna keep playing Minecraft.

6126
03:43:50,580 --> 03:43:51,740
I'm gonna call it here.

6127
03:43:52,140 --> 03:43:54,620
I'll see you next time, Gumi.

6128
03:43:55,740 --> 03:43:57,220
I'll message you after this.

6129
03:43:57,480 --> 03:43:57,960
Yeah, yeah.

6130
03:43:58,020 --> 03:44:00,200
Bye-bye, Gumi.

6131
03:44:01,440 --> 03:44:02,240
Bye-bye.

6132
03:44:02,240 --> 03:44:02,640
Bye -bye.

6133
03:44:04,260 --> 03:44:05,460
Alright, everybody.

6134
03:44:06,020 --> 03:44:07,640
I think I did really well!

6135
03:44:07,980 --> 03:44:10,100
I think I'm perfect husband material.

6136
03:44:10,560 --> 03:44:11,340
Don't you guys think so?

6137
03:44:11,920 --> 03:44:12,480
Yeah!

6138
03:44:15,540 --> 03:44:16,660
I honestly...

6139
03:44:16,660 --> 03:44:17,960
I honestly... like, I did not realize...

6140
03:44:17,960 --> 03:44:20,400
this game was like... had so many...

6141
03:44:20,400 --> 03:44:21,200
things in it.

6142
03:44:21,300 --> 03:44:22,440
The only thing I knew...

6143
03:44:22,440 --> 03:44:24,300
about this game was like...

6144
03:44:24,300 --> 03:44:25,360
the math part.

6145
03:44:25,660 --> 03:44:27,880
And I didn't realize how much more complicated...

6146
03:44:27,880 --> 03:44:30,040
this game was beyond math.

6147
03:44:30,220 --> 03:44:31,680
I was like, holy shit!

6148
03:44:32,240 --> 03:44:33,940
There's more to this game than just...

6149
03:44:33,940 --> 03:44:34,920
the math portion.

6150
03:44:35,200 --> 03:44:36,180
There's so much...

6151
03:44:36,180 --> 03:44:36,500
more!

6152
03:44:37,240 --> 03:44:37,760
There's...

6153
03:44:37,760 --> 03:44:39,300
bees and rats!

6154
03:44:39,700 --> 03:44:40,320
Tree rats.

6155
03:44:40,700 --> 03:44:41,500
Anyway, guys.

6156
03:44:41,760 --> 03:44:43,360
I'm gonna call it here everybody.

6157
03:44:43,700 --> 03:44:45,500
And take a rest day...

6158
03:44:45,500 --> 03:44:46,800
Take tomorrow as a rest day.

6159
03:44:46,960 --> 03:44:47,980
I'm gonna rest today.

6160
03:44:48,460 --> 03:44:48,980
Um...

6161
03:44:48,980 --> 03:44:50,820
I feel very, very tired.

6162
03:44:51,000 --> 03:44:52,240
Today was a very, very...

6163
03:44:52,240 --> 03:44:53,180
busy week for me.

6164
03:44:53,300 --> 03:44:54,120
So I'm...

6165
03:44:54,120 --> 03:44:56,280
going to... You know, I actually was tempted...

6166
03:44:56,280 --> 03:44:58,280
to like actually reschedule one of my...

6167
03:44:58,280 --> 03:44:58,560
streams.

6168
03:44:58,820 --> 03:44:59,860
Like, I think I was like...

6169
03:44:59,860 --> 03:45:02,220
thinking about rescheduling the...

6170
03:45:03,140 --> 03:45:03,780
steam stream.

6171
03:45:04,000 --> 03:45:05,440
Because I was feeling really, really tired.

6172
03:45:05,720 --> 03:45:06,520
But I was like, no!

6173
03:45:07,140 --> 03:45:07,460
No!

6174
03:45:07,560 --> 03:45:09,500
The happiest I feel is when I'm streaming.

6175
03:45:09,760 --> 03:45:12,160
And I know when I stream, I will feel so much better.

6176
03:45:12,360 --> 03:45:13,820
So like, I like push forward.

6177
03:45:13,980 --> 03:45:15,900
Because every time I was like, oh my gosh, I'm so tired.

6178
03:45:16,260 --> 03:45:17,680
I'm so tired and exhausted.

6179
03:45:18,420 --> 03:45:19,120
But I was like, no!

6180
03:45:19,540 --> 03:45:19,860
Doki.

6181
03:45:20,020 --> 03:45:22,000
You're happiest when you're streaming and you'll feel...

6182
03:45:22,000 --> 03:45:23,300
so much better you do the stream.

6183
03:45:23,500 --> 03:45:24,100
And I did!

6184
03:45:24,220 --> 03:45:25,080
I felt so much better.

6185
03:45:25,180 --> 03:45:25,960
Yeah, it does help.

6186
03:45:26,040 --> 03:45:26,480
I love streaming.

6187
03:45:26,900 --> 03:45:28,160
Um, and I always love streaming...

6188
03:45:28,160 --> 03:45:28,560
for you guys.

6189
03:45:28,620 --> 03:45:29,240
So it does help.

6190
03:45:29,340 --> 03:45:30,300
So I'm glad I did stream...

6191
03:45:30,300 --> 03:45:30,540
yesterday.

6192
03:45:31,040 --> 03:45:31,920
Um, but yeah.

6193
03:45:32,240 --> 03:45:33,940
I'm gonna take a rest now.

6194
03:45:34,240 --> 03:45:35,720
I'm sorry I can't do a little...

6195
03:45:35,720 --> 03:45:37,960
We haven't done like a little end of stream...

6196
03:45:37,960 --> 03:45:39,060
Zastadons in a while.

6197
03:45:39,220 --> 03:45:40,160
Or like do like super chat...

6198
03:45:40,160 --> 03:45:40,840
readings at the end.

6199
03:45:41,060 --> 03:45:42,160
Um, I'm still trying...

6200
03:45:42,160 --> 03:45:44,140
to like slowly... not slowly...

6201
03:45:44,140 --> 03:45:46,000
like fast adjust right now.

6202
03:45:46,160 --> 03:45:47,400
To everything going on.

6203
03:45:47,460 --> 03:45:48,100
There's so many like...

6204
03:45:48,100 --> 03:45:50,120
behind the scenes stuff that I always have to do everyday.

6205
03:45:50,640 --> 03:45:52,220
Um, so that's why there...

6206
03:45:52,220 --> 03:45:54,660
hasn't been much like Zastadons at the end yet.

6207
03:45:54,760 --> 03:45:56,640
When I finally stabilize...

6208
03:45:56,640 --> 03:45:58,360
we will have our... we will bring back...

6209
03:45:58,360 --> 03:46:00,440
a little chat together at the end...

6210
03:46:00,440 --> 03:46:02,220
of the streams and a little... the super chat...

6211
03:46:02,240 --> 03:46:03,400
readings at the end of the stream.

6212
03:46:03,500 --> 03:46:03,760
But yes!

6213
03:46:03,780 --> 03:46:04,360
Thank you everybody!

6214
03:46:04,640 --> 03:46:05,760
As always everyone...

6215
03:46:05,760 --> 03:46:08,060
stay hydrated, posture check, get up and...

6216
03:46:08,060 --> 03:46:08,340
move around.

6217
03:46:08,580 --> 03:46:10,060
Uh, to get that blood flowing.

6218
03:46:10,220 --> 03:46:11,940
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

6219
03:46:12,040 --> 03:46:12,940
Cause you deserve it!

6220
03:46:13,100 --> 03:46:14,080

6221
03:46:14,500 --> 03:46:15,200
