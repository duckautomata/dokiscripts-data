Look at all the PJs again, the rerun!

And there's the key chains again!

26
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,010
And there's the key chains, and there's exclusive bonuses like voice packs.

27
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:33,810
So yeah!

28
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,790
Look at all these items!

29
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:38,710
Oh my god, it's time to get ripped out!

30
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,790
with the Duel Keeper Gina Collection.

31
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:49,730
So yeah, for those who don't know, I have a apparel collection collab with Gina Draws.

32
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:50,790
I love her stuff.

33
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,390
I actually own several of her hoodies.

34
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:57,990
I actually bought some of her stuff pre- YouTubing times.

35
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:02,710
So it was such a fun, great, and great honor to collab with her.

36
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,070
And I guess I know there's two weeks left for pre-orders.

37
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,710
So get yours before it's gone forever.

38
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,810
I don't know if we're ever going to rerun of them.

39
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:15,370
So this is your chance to get the apparel collection before it's gone.

40
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,950
And we snap it out of existence.

41
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,510
But yeah, just a little chill bug time.

42
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,810
Other than that, nothing else.

43
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,950
Oh yeah, I almost forgot.

44
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:25,590
I was like, nothing else.

45
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:31,550
By the way, so I found out during yesterday's member stream.

46
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,730
Well, I didn't find out.

47
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:36,730
I just, like, remembered about it because I forgot.

48
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:43,590
A month and a half ago, they gave me an EA creator code.

49
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:57,270
And for those who don't know what creator codes are, it's basically like whenever you, it's like basically a Fortnite creator code where if you buy something, you put in like the creator code, like some of the revenue goes towards like the creator versus towards the company.

50
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:03,130
So I got that a month and a half ago and I forgot about it.

51
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,630
To be fair, I was traveling.

52
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:15,990
It was like I was literally like two days before I was traveling the guanjos So there was a lot of stuff going on.

53
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:34,730
So basically I might have missed out on the battlefield six for the creator code, but like But that means you can cancel your pre-orders and then re-pre-order it again with my creator Don't do that.

54
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:41,890
It's all right guys, so don't do that guys for legal reasons, don't actually do that because I don't want to actually get in trouble with EA.

55
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:56,970
So basically, if you use the creator code Dokeybird on any EA purchases, I don't even know if it works on skin, like, like Apex skins or anything.

56
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,010
I haven't used it yet.

57
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:07,610
Um, but if you buy anything on EA store and I legitimately didn't realize Battlefield 6 was E.

58
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,010
I don't know.

59
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,610
It just feels like, I don't know.

60
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:15,970
Like all these AAA companies sort of blurred together for me.

61
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:21,670
So I legitimately cannot remember any AAA company that does what game these days.

62
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:27,330
Because like they all sort of, they're like this like conglomerate that merged together like a fusion.

63
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:30,470
Because they're all the same to me.

64
00:08:32,770 --> 00:09:10,190
So I legitimately forgot that EA made battle of battlefield um and because like you know i didn't have to also like i don't know it's just i just they all blurted together um um so yeah so yeah you can use my creator code jokeyberry um to so that some of the revenue doesn't go straight to ea go straight to me yay yay fund my bad spending their bad spending habits yippee

65
00:09:15,890 --> 00:10:46,230
um anyway that's that's all the shilling i was gonna do today um other than that uh it's uh i'll give you guys a dad update dad update sorry my brain is really slow because it's a it's uh it's really slow because i just woke up i didn't have time to rev up the engine today so my brain is like little slow right now a little i know i'm always a little slow but like this is a little slower than usual dread fighter thank you for welcome to tomato farm welcome welcome that update um not much of an update it's just more so of him being a little piece of uh but um you know ever since he got i swear ever since he like recovered uh from surgery and his second injury um he's like He like doesn't care anymore He's like You only have one life on this earth On this world You gotta make it count Take your chances Life is short So yolo You only live once Anyway So Ever since ever since he's you know gone through two life-threatening injuries um he's been extra bratty and extra territorial and extra

66
00:10:46,230 --> 00:11:36,330
aggressive towards other dogs um literally like we i would take him on walkies and he would see a dog from across the street literally across the street and it's like pretty far he would he would see a dog from across the street stare at him for like 10 seconds like stop he'll stop from the walk and then stare at them and then and then after 10 seconds he'll be like that what are you looking at bro that's right don't you dare cross this street This is my territory.

67
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:37,950
My home.

68
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:42,330
I'm going to pee on that grass so you don't know this is my area.

69
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,890
Don't you dare come here.

70
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,310
Don't you dare cross that street.

71
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,670
And, like, he would just bark at them.

72
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:50,890
I don't understand.

73
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,650
He's never done that before.

74
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:58,410
Like, I own this blog.

75
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,290
So, like, and...

76
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:07,010
And they'd be, like, just across the street.

77
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,050
The other dog is like, what the fuck?

78
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:09,810
Like, what are you?

79
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:12,670
Like, the other dog is just like, what's wrong with it?

80
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,270
Like, what's up with this guy?

81
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:22,650
Like, so, like, he's never done this before, before his injuries.

82
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:28,190
It's only after his injuries that he's, like, been challenging dogs from eight miles away.

83
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,990
And also, I guess another dad update.

84
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:37,090
Today on his, oh yeah, this happened today on his walk, but it's been happening a lot in his walkies.

85
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:46,610
Um, uh, basically like, uh, I was walking dad on this patch of grass and it's next to the road.

86
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:57,170
And there was this couple, um, in their car and the lady on the passenger seat, not the driver's seat on the passenger seat, just so you guys know it, on the passenger seat,

87
00:13:01,990 --> 00:14:13,100
her boyfriend or like husband I don't know I don't see no ring and was like oh look at this cute little dog look at him look at that weenie dog it's so cute and they're like literally like right beside me like on the road and and then dad you know he looks up it was like oh I love attention especially from pretty ladies and then you know he was like he got his you know he like acknowledged him for like two seconds then he turns around and then starts pooping in front of the you know in front of her and he's like yeah you like what you see like and the lady instantly like instantly pulls the window back up because did not i do i don't think she likes what she saw i really i i don't know i have a suspicion that she did not like what she saw

88
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:31,120
it's the girl lady like it's like oh it's so cute what a cute dog look at it look at the weeder dog turns around just starts pooping in front of her hey babe she starts shitting on the floor

89
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:39,570
Yeah, and then they drove away.

90
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,650
Dumb wolf.

91
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:43,970
Then give him the super chat.

92
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:44,830
Thank you, thank you.

93
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:49,110
Dad, life's too short to wait for a girl to wake up to feed me.

94
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,430
Then give him the super chat.

95
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:50,990
Thank you.

96
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:51,850
Thank you.

97
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,230
Solid snake.

98
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:54,170
Thank you, super chat.

99
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:54,510
Thank you.

100
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:55,090
Thank you.

101
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:57,450
At least with Doki, you can see where the money goes.

102
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,370
Like on Fortnite Jordan.

103
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,170
Yeah, yeah, guys.

104
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:08,010
By using your creator code on EA, I'll make sure to spend it on Air Jordan's on Fortnite.

105
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:08,990
Oh my god.

106
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:09,770
Oh, guys.

107
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:14,730
Okay, I did this on the Mem Machine, but I bought new shoes, but it's on Fortnite.

108
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:16,490
Look, I need shoes.

109
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:17,110
Okay, okay.

110
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:24,930
My current shoes might be like two plus years old, and I have only one pair of sneakers and one pair of sandals.

111
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:30,330
I've been wearing them for like two plus years, but you don't understand.

112
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:33,490
I need more shoes in my Fortnite closet.

113
00:15:35,430 --> 00:16:05,650
I got them I bought it guys I bought converse and air jordans in fortnight so my beavers can wear his air jordans you don't understand beavers needed this he needs to be dripped out with his kicks you don't understand who needs real shoes when my virtual avatars are dripped out with kicks guys You don't understand.

114
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:09,750
Look, it's all about my reputation on Fortnite.

115
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,450
He needed...

116
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:17,490
My xenomorph needed his jays, okay?

117
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:21,690
Look, the other Fortnite players are gonna make fun of him.

118
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,450
He's not dripped out with the Jordans.

119
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,270
With his pumped-up kicks.

120
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:31,650
Guys, you don't understand.

121
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:32,910
I can't...

122
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:33,290
Guys.

123
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:36,590
Real Jordans get creases.

124
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:42,010
Virtual Jordans in Fortnite will stay pure forever.

125
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:47,150
The value can only go up.

126
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:53,530
Anyway.

127
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:54,550
All right.

128
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,150
Silk song time.

129
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:56,750
Yippee.

130
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,330
Some of you guys might be wondering.

131
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:58,870
Wow.

132
00:16:58,990 --> 00:16:59,430
Doki.

133
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:03,390
Why did you wait so long to play Silk song?

134
00:17:03,490 --> 00:18:05,790
part two because i was getting fucking tired of getting lost okay i was so tired of getting lost and like being on random side quests on fighting bosses that i shouldn't even be fighting i was so i was look guys i legitimately thought we were making really good progress on silk song during the launch because i was like wow look at all these all the areas i've explored oh my god i must have unlocked like 70 70 to 80 of the map by now and then like you know two days later because that's how fast people it takes for people to like complete the game i guess two days later i saw the actual map and i was like I was only,

135
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:14,270
you know how I was like, surely it can't get worse, you know, surely, surely the jail is the worst part of, um, of silk song.

136
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:15,490
I was wrong.

137
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:16,690
It does get worse.

138
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,650
It, I, I saw an area.

139
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:24,650
Um, I was spoiled for an area because, you know, my for you page is like all silk song now.

140
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:27,350
And, and then like, I saw an area.

141
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:33,470
I won't spoil it yet for those who have not like seen the rest of silk song and are also just in the jail.

142
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:37,430
area, it does indeed get worse.

143
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,090
It gets a lot worse.

144
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:45,730
Not only do the enemies, not only is it the environment that gets worse, it's like the end.

145
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,690
Oh, the jail gets a lot worse.

146
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,690
I was like, surely that's it, right?

147
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:58,350
Surely the, what I've seen so far of the jail area with the dogs and the poison swabs, that's it, right?

148
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:02,050
No, I, I know what comes, what comes after in the jail area.

149
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,570
It's all downhill.

150
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:10,750
It's all downhill from here.

151
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:22,690
But I've merely only unlocked, I think, like, 30% of the map, which is crazy because I feel like I explored so much within the first stream.

152
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,430
There's apparently a super jail.

153
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,310
I thought I was already...

154
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,690
I was like, there's a super jail.

155
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:50,470
i thought there was only one jail what do you mean a super jail what crimes do i have to commit to get into super jail like like i was like oh my i feel like it's like maximum security in jail

156
00:19:53,870 --> 00:20:30,370
so so yeah that's why um that's why i also waited a while before i played silk song just because I knew that by the time I play do a part two like everybody will already be done with the game like I I know you guys you guys waited seven years I know you haven't put down the game since it came out so I was like okay I'll just wait and then then finally finally I can be guided to the right way uh I was like by that time people would have beaten the game and then I can be

157
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:52,570
I won't be lost anymore um also uh for those who don't know um silk song did end up getting nerfed and um and uh they nerfed a couple of that's also why I waited that's like

158
00:20:55,830 --> 00:22:10,290
that's also why I waited but also the worst part is that it didn't even matter that I waited because they nerfed all the bosses that I've already beat I was like are you serious are you fucking they weren't even the hard ones too for me okay apparently more wing and the the tree mom or whatever the fuck she I don't even know her name like I killed her first try like um what's like I killed her second try and so I like I didn't even register her name um so uh they nerfed the the more fly or whatever giant bug um at the that does like that shasha shasha shasha and you know everything this time also i found out that 80 of the enemies in this game does times two damage like what the i was like what's the point of giving us like just just delete our hp like don't even give us six like giving us six hp was a lie like that's not it's not even just gave us three at that point HP and then everything does one damage if that's the case like why did they lie to us it gave us me a full false sense

159
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:30,010
of security with all that HP they gave me like hornet's frail body she's so one of her broons made of fucking glass oh my i swear to god like you're like no it's me silk is actually really really strong do you not see me fucking slashy slashy with my silk

160
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:37,210
I feel like I my my HP is like Zimbabwe currency.

161
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:58,650
It's like a million It's like worth a minute like you see that it's a million dollars, but it's actually worth three dollars like Like the fucking my health inflation is only going up Just don't I just don't get hit toky

162
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:06,450
Yeah, inflation is rough on Silk Song.

163
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:12,850
Anyway, Silk Song had a nerf, and so they nerfed.

164
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:17,770
Apparently, they also, like, they nerfed the economy of Silk Song.

165
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:18,550
So, yippee!

166
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:24,930
The market crashed in Silk Song, and we're now in the Great Recession, because now benches are cheaper.

167
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:25,830
Yay!

168
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:29,490
I was just like, thank God.

169
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:30,810
No, I knew it.

170
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:31,210
I knew it.

171
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:33,090
During launch, I was, like, making all these comments.

172
00:23:33,490 --> 00:24:01,990
being like okay the rosary shit like this is it's so hard to like farm money it's like really hard to farm money and it's everything is so fucking expensive and all that shit and i knew it i knew it was i knew it i was just like i can't be the only one complaining i was like why is everything so expensive like how bad is capitalism right now in silk sign oh my god i'm waiting for That's why I waited too.

173
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:06,430
I waited for the bubble to burst so I can head to the Great Recession in Silk Song.

174
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:10,970
Because I, I, I, what was it called when you bet against the stocks?

175
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:17,790
I was one of those people that bet against the stocks.

176
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:20,810
And now I am the millionaire because I waited.

177
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,430
I shorted.

178
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:23,530
That's right.

179
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:27,470
I was shorting the Silk Song stocks by waiting.

180
00:24:29,470 --> 00:25:24,250
I was I shorted silk song I bet against the market I knew it so now benches are apparently a lot cheaper now and think like it's easier to farm rosaries now so I'm like thank fucking god I finally got what I deserve and so like during lunch I was like am I bad like you know because like it felt so hard i was like there's i was like wait the fuck like i had such an easy time in hollow night and then getting the silk song you know it took me like several tries for bosses versus like first trying like bosses in hollow night and i was like so confused i was like there's no way like did i there's no way i got worse in between because like i there was barely And then,

181
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:33,750
like, you know, after that stream, I saw people suffering even more, which made my heart grow two times that day, just like the damage I take.

182
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:40,950
And, yes, I did take enjoyment out of other people's pain, and you can't judge me on this.

183
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:45,310
You watch me play this game for the same reason.

184
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,050
You're just like me.

185
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:50,210
I am the mirror into your soul.

186
00:25:54,730 --> 00:26:05,010
so i was like oh thank god everyone else is worse than me i was like thank god i'm still a gamer

187
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:25,270
the day my ego grew three times larger um and like like i said it was like everyone was complaining about the times two damage and um and fucking savage beast fly I knew that fucker was hard.

188
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,010
I was like, there's no way.

189
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:32,350
There's no way that I am the only one suffering from this goddamn fucking stupid bug.

190
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:33,610
There's no fucking way.

191
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:39,690
And then my entire timeline was just people like complaining about him and being like, I've beaten this boss.

192
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:42,030
So I beat, I defeated all this.

193
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:45,030
I won all, I finished all Souls games.

194
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:48,350
I did like, I completed all the endings of Hollow Knight.

195
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,970
But this guy, this guy.

196
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,210
And I'm like, I knew it.

197
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:52,690
I knew.

198
00:26:53,130 --> 00:27:25,170
feel so vindicated i was like validation five my god i spending was it less like 40 minutes on this i knew i wasn't the only one and i was the fact that i was able to brute force it with no upgrades or the side tools because i did it no better i literally launched i nobody knew i i this is also why i waited too by the way I was not going through another beast fly.

199
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:43,450
I'm not going through another savage beast fly situation where I get sidetracked into a boss fight that didn't fucking matter and that didn't that didn't fucking matter and gave me nothing.

200
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:48,230
It gave me apparently the beast crest is the one the worst crest out there.

201
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:50,370
So it didn't fucking matter.

202
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:52,190
No, it didn't matter.

203
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:55,210
Everyone was Like, that Chris fucking sucks.

204
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,550
And I'm like, what?

205
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:59,990
But I spent 40 minutes on these.

206
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:07,630
You cannot tell me that my reward is considered emptier for how much pain I went through.

207
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,910
But, Dukie, you got a clue.

208
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:15,950
It doesn't matter.

209
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:20,070
Never again.

210
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:26,770
Never, never again.

211
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:35,370
So, yeah, no one knew better back then.

212
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:40,570
I hope he never gets nerfed and we all suffer and cry for the future generation.

213
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:50,370
I hope your great, great grandchild picks up Silk Song and goes through savage beast fly in his original form.

214
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:53,110
Because if I had to, the whole world...

215
00:28:53,130 --> 00:29:03,390
world has to today on turkey's daily my feelings are valid

216
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:24,410

Thank you not also.

219
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:30,490
I forgot how to play this game Um, it's it's been a while.

220
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:31,770
Okay, this is Matt.

221
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:44,850
I might I waited and now I also forgot how to play this game Um, let's see it Um Wait

222
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,420

00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,100
Give me a sec, guys.

225
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:00,640

227
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,600
Wait, it's not.

228
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,460
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

229
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,300
Wait a minute.

230
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:14,260
I crashed out and then all my stuff is not working.

231
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:15,860
Oh, no.

232
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,080
Guns working.

233
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:17,900
Oh, no.

234
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:18,880
My legs are extending.

235
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,600
It's really hard to see because the map is like...

236
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,140
The map is so dark.

237
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,420
I was like, are my legs extending, guys?

238
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,680
What happened to my leg surgery?

239
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,920
My leg extendo surgery.

240
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,260
I paid top dollar to be a little taller.

241
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,140
All right, give me a sec.

242
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,420
I realize I messed up a little bit.

243
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,460
I want to move myself up just a little bit.

244
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,160
There we go.

245
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:51,760
All right, there we go.

246
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,620
I want to move myself up.

247
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,060
I want to look a little taller.

248
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:07,200
there we go that's right now I'm a little taller

249
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:27,060
hello and hearing awful whispers in camp about pilgrims driven mad by the hardship of the climb crying out and attacking their fellows you've been out there tell me is it really so You've heard it true, sir.

250
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:35,000
On the roads, both pilgrims and beasts alike are consumed, driven into violence by a haunted thread, the source of which I have yet to discover.

251
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,900
I fear it will so.

252
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,980
I won't be able to trust a single face on the path then.

253
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:47,780
The risk of death was daunting enough, but Lonius is such a journey that seems almost too much to bear.

254
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:52,980
Ah, well, just another test of our devotion, I suppose.

255
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:09,340
Rest here with me as long as you like I'm not ready to leave yet And a little company is always nice Okay Alright goodbye Where do I run?

256
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:26,400
Okay Yippee, yippee, yippee, yippee, yippee, yippee, yippee I love that run I love my What's it called when When the dog gets really My zoomies I love my little zoomies Won't you stop and make a trade Oh my gosh, I'm so...

257
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,480
Okay, let's go get some money, actually.

258
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,080
Also, do I have all the maps?

259
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,340
Okay, I just forgot I don't have double jump.

260
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,360
Yes, got it.

261
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:38,920
Alright.

262
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,600
Oh, no, none of these matter.

263
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,600
Okay, where is a good place to farm again?

264
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,300
I gotta remember where to farm.

265
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,580
Baby, thank you for the super chat.

266
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,240
Thank you, thank you.

267
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,560
Okay, I can bring up the overall volume.

268
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,520
I wonder if I can do it here.

269
00:32:55,060 --> 00:34:22,340
can nice all right aida aida you know what wait i want to be i want you to see my i want to like levitate a little bit all right yeah you can do your little zoomies tail give me a sec i'm just fixing some overlay did i feel like super okay by the way today is gonna be a little bit of a shorter stream like um from how long my usual streams are uh just because that I want to save my voice today um and not straining it too much so we're not going to do another 10 hours like last time we'll do nine hours don't worry guys we'll do nine hours instead of 10 I don't guys okay now that we all know now oh wait I have to go to the god fucking I have to go to the jail cell I oh yeah also I found out the stupid fucking more wing shit you can actually get like a helper to help you kill them too but he wasn't that hard okay for me I didn't realize more wing was considered one like the hardest like one of the first filters for like new were players because for me i didn't find him that difficult um um

270
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:49,000
but apparently for the fly thing here yeah i i didn't think it was that bad but also like you know um i do have really good reflexes so i can under like um i can bypass that so uh but there's actually a helper you can get from here that that also assists in your fight and help you like uh kill like help you kill him Um...

271
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:55,000
I think it's more so of like, it's just basically like, if you have the reflexes and stuff.

272
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:57,740
It's just like a ref- like a reflex test.

273
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,640
Because for me, it was fine.

274
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,920
I didn't have that much of a bad time.

275
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:11,650
Because I was like, am I for you?

276
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:15,030
People were like saying how they got stuck on- on him.

277
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:20,030
Like, people were saying how he- they got stuck on him for hours, even with- what's his name?

278
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:20,690

00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,040
Jesus Christ, he's so annoying.

What the fuck?

287
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,740

00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,400

293
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,840

00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:40,010
Sorry, I'm like super anal about this.

297
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,330
It ain't natural.

298
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:46,650
We're the ground at.

299
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:47,650
Okay, there we go.

300
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,840
Oh my god, I feel so slow right now.

301
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,120
I actually feel so slow.

302
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:02,460
I'm literally like fighting these guys to like remember how to play.

They're like, um, actually, um, the Reaper quest is actually one of the worst ones, so I don't know why you're using it.

305
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:47,720
I'm like, oh, it's good for...

306
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,380
In my heart, it's good!

307
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:59,080
Okay, oh my god, bro, fuck off.

308
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,680
Apparently, because it's, like, one of the slower ones.

309
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,880

00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,270
I guess the other crest would be...

314
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:46,530
It would be the default.

315
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:50,110
I'm not gonna try it out and see how I feel.

316
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:53,030

319
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,930
How do I use the weapons?

320
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:02,630
My extra weapons?

321
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:04,690
Oh wait.

322
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:05,770
Adidas!

323
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,460
Uh, was it R?

324
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:14,880

325
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,280
Oh, okay, there you go.

326
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,360
I didn't think of the super chat thing.

327
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:21,160
Yeah.

328
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:22,480
Reaper is good.

329
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,840
Your friend is a casual.

330
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:25,720
Adidas!

331
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,220
There you go.

332
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:35,940
I don't even remember what, like, the special feature is for...

333
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:37,300
Uh...

334
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,520
For...

335
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:38,880
Uh...

336
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,220
For the magic.

337
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,500
of the default one.

338
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,480
Alright,

339
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,040
we all get 500.

340
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,920
So I can get the key.

341
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,600
It's farming time.

342
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:57,960
Adidas!

343
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,320
That's fine, I don't really care.

344
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,720
You're just here to be farmed.

345
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:04,760
That's right.

346
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,120
That's your only purpose in life.

347
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,740
To be farmed.

348
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,480
Nice.

349
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,440
What the fuck?

350
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,380
Oh my god, I forgot you jumped.

351
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,360
I think the hard part is just remembering of the dash.

352
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:38,300
The dash is the downward dash throws me off because it's slightly slanted.

353
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,800
Remember that Reaper let you poke a strain, therefore made it easier.

354
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,520
Therefore, your friend is categorically wrong.

355
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,260
You're right.

356
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,820
Everything I say is the right way.

357
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,600
You're so right.

358
00:40:52,620 --> 00:41:10,130

362
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:39,680
Nice.

363
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,700
Okay, now I don't have silk anymore.

364
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,220
Remember when I was really rich and then I lost it all because I got sent to super jail?

365
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,300
Wait, no, I haven't got to super jail yet.

366
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,960
I just got to regular jail.

367
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,000
I... Oh my god.

368
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:54,040

369
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,760
Are they gonna take my clothes?

370
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:05,020
Get you out of here.

371
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,120
Oh, no, my money.

372
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,840

373
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,120

00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,280
Chog's only Pogo diagonally.

377
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,220
Thank you.

378
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:19,440
Thank you.

379
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:20,960
Alright.

380
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:23,340
Groundhog.

381
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,760
Back to Groundhog Day for these guys.

382
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:26,820
Adidas!

383
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:34,080
My... No, get out of there!

384
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,060
How would I farm you if you die?

385
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:44,900
I'll do it.

386
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:45,520
I don't even know how...

387
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,380
Oh yeah, also... That's also why I waited.

388
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,480
Because I need people to...

389
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,100
I need people to help me figure out how to get an upgraded nail.

390
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:54,880
Never again.

391
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,140
We're not letting this happen again.

392
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:01,000
I'm not having a repeat of Hollow Knight.

393
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,900
I need to know how to get my upgraded nail.

394
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:14,910
Upgrading the nail is very hard.

395
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:19,210
I need a...

396
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:21,190
It's a sacrifice I must make.

397
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:24,250
I cannot finish this game on plus two damage.

398
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:25,990
I...

399
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:30,050
Oh, we're farming for...

400
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:31,130
I should have done this off stream.

401
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:32,630
I should have done...

402
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:34,810
I should just farm the rosaries off stream.

403
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:37,090
I just forgot how...

404
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:40,930
I just forgot that...

405
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:44,390
how tedious this is to farm rosaries.

406
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:52,410
Am I at 500 yet?

407
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:00,660
Okay.

408
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:03,420
Okay, almost there.

409
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,380
418.

410
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:11,750
Yeah, but I want to get the key.

411
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:13,330
The simple key.

412
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:14,910
I don't have it.

413
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:44,490
Oh my god, I was trying to oh my god give me a stride up i was not paying i was trying to figure out how do i i was like oh my tools i gotta use my tool and then instead i just instead of pressing up rb i was pressing my map i was like oh up like my map my map button yeah i don't care anymore Yeah

414
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:58,350
No, it's like it's 500 I literally saw is she fucking a she raised her prices We are in the great recession and you're raising your prices

415
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:08,050
Oh wait, I thought I had JK.

416
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:20,230
Oh my gosh, I legitimately thought It's fine I thought I had Um, more silk.

417
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:22,950
Alright, nice, we're almost done.

418
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:26,630
It's called a monopoly.

419
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:29,110
There's no way she has all the keys.

420
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:31,290
I refuse to believe it.

421
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:37,470
Alright, one more time.

422
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:38,830

Yeah, there we go.

426
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:46,930
Alright.

00:45:49,490 --> 00:46:21,650
to free up I can use the key okay guys okay so I didn't get spoiled that much but the reason why I'm getting a key is because I know for the key I can either do two things I can either use it for myself to get a quest or be a good person and free free a man free an innocent man from jail and because I am a I am going to get a crest

Okay, I got it.

00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:07,510
Alright.

467
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:10,090
Okay, that's not okay.

468
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:11,270
That is not okay.

469
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:12,190
Sir, sir, sir, sir.

470
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:13,130
That is not okay.

471
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:14,610
That is not okay.

472
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:17,390
That is not okay.

473
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:17,930
Okay.

474
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:21,010

I had to kill you!

478
00:50:31,850 --> 00:50:33,490
It was for a child!

479
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:40,120
Okay.

480
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:44,430
All right.

481
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:47,850
We got better.

482
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:50,130

483
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:52,110

He's so tanky.

489
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:15,640
This is why we need the nail upgrade.

490
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,160
This is exactly why we need the nail upgrade.

491
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:21,040
He's so tanky.

492
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:28,150
Oh my god, fucking worse.

493
00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:28,890
Right.

495
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:33,050

499
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:47,930
I think this was the child.

500
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:50,370
That's fucked up, man.

501
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:52,990
That was his make-a-wish.

502
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:55,490
That's so fucked up.

503
00:51:57,730 --> 00:51:59,510
The shop is gone!

504
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:01,610

00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:05,830

Benefragus.

509
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:08,210
It's well that you kept yourself safe.

510
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:09,970
This settlement needs a fixer now.

511
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:11,170
Not a warrior.

512
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:13,750
Maybe that's true.

513
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:19,390
Times like this, these all we can do is put our heads down and try to rebuild.

514
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:20,730
No, no.

515
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:24,710
This child, this child caused his own death.

516
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:26,970
Should have made that wish, kid.

517
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:29,590
Should have made that wish.

518
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:34,690
That's on him.

519
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:39,150
It's not my fault.

520
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:41,830
His wish caused this.

521
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:47,730
You have to keep the monkey paw curls.

522
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:52,170
Look, all I'm...

523
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:55,050
His makeup wish was literally, I don't like this guy.

524
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:55,950
Please kill him.

525
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:57,190

00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:35,800
You might want to check the moss, grotto, sit it.

It's fine.

585
01:00:53,810 --> 01:00:55,230

Okay, no, I can still heal from it.

Let's see.

596
01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:27,100
This way, we just go left.

597
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:29,260
Left side, left side.

598
01:01:34,330 --> 01:01:36,670
Alright, there you go.

599
01:01:37,550 --> 01:01:37,810
Alright.

600
01:01:38,290 --> 01:01:39,110
Simple key.

601
01:01:39,490 --> 01:01:42,230
It cost me one child and 500 rosaries.

602
01:01:43,050 --> 01:01:44,770
Better be fucking worth it.

603
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:49,120

I'm not paying attention.

608
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:59,140
That is a 100% on me.

609
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:04,460
What?

610
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:06,800
Okay.

611
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:09,380
Maybe I should have got the bench.

612
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:13,840
Guys, I think I should have got the bench.

613
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:14,680
Wait, can I farm these?

633
01:03:36,210 --> 01:03:37,270
Why can't I farm you?

634
01:03:37,490 --> 01:03:38,230
What is that?

635
01:03:39,630 --> 01:03:41,170
What do I get out of it?

636
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:43,290
Oh, I can't use it?

637
01:03:45,250 --> 01:03:47,070
Okay, now I'm in another secret.

638
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:47,970
Where the fuck?

639
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:53,310
What do I do here?

640
01:03:55,990 --> 01:03:56,470
What?

641
01:03:59,390 --> 01:04:01,250
Oh, is this a quest area?

642
01:04:01,490 --> 01:04:04,530
Okay, now I'm in another secret that gives me nothing.

643
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:06,830
There's nothing!

644
01:04:07,170 --> 01:04:07,590
Yippee!

645
01:04:09,350 --> 01:04:10,210
Oh shit.

646
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:13,570
Wait, what?

647
01:04:13,670 --> 01:04:14,730
It brought me back here?

648
01:04:17,850 --> 01:04:20,050
You get absolutely nothing.

649
01:04:21,810 --> 01:04:23,350
Fuck yeah, I love nothing.

650
01:04:24,850 --> 01:04:26,930
Oh my god, nothing for three?

651
01:04:27,470 --> 01:04:28,610
Oh my god!

652
01:04:34,430 --> 01:04:35,950
I'm so lost.

653
01:04:36,770 --> 01:04:38,350
I am so lost.

654
01:04:38,630 --> 01:04:40,550
Where am I going?

655
01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:42,810
Oh my!

656
01:04:49,870 --> 01:04:50,990
That's on me.

657
01:04:51,590 --> 01:04:53,070
Oh shit, Ness, I got it.

658
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:55,530
I got a memory locket.

659
01:04:56,030 --> 01:04:57,930
In the spikes it seems.

660
01:04:59,490 --> 01:05:01,230
I'm not okay right now.

661
01:05:01,390 --> 01:05:03,170
Please tell me there's an easier way.

662
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:11,300
Not a good day for Doki.

663
01:05:13,180 --> 01:05:15,360
Oh god, oh god, oh god.

664
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:19,880
I need those like snake things I can farm right now.

665
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:26,140
I'm scared.

666
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:29,460
Literally like a paper can blow at me and I'll die.

667
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:31,980
I'll die from the impact.

668
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:34,000
Nice.

669
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:35,420
I need these.

670
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:37,880
That's actually what I need.

671
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:42,560
Alright, let's just farm these guys.

672
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:48,080
Dude, my mind today is really, really slow.

673
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:51,640
I wasn't lying.

674
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:54,280
It's very slow today.

675
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:57,600
Okay.

676
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:01,320
Alright.

677
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:07,360
Up, right?

678
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:08,560
I gotta get there.

679
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:09,400
Oh my god.

680
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:09,920
What the?

681
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:11,280
Get out of here.

682
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:13,720
Yeah?

683
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:15,080
Wait, which way?

684
01:06:17,020 --> 01:06:18,020
Okay, guys.

685
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:18,580
Which way?

686
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:28,320
No, this is where I went.

687
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:30,640
Up, then, right.

688
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:31,940
This way?

689
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:34,280
Oh, my God.

690
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:37,260
I thought you'd be, like, here?

691
01:06:43,810 --> 01:06:44,690
Okay, down?

692
01:06:47,850 --> 01:06:48,410
I don't know.

693
01:06:48,510 --> 01:06:49,690
Have I been down here yet?

694
01:06:50,930 --> 01:06:52,710
Oh, the farms are stuck real fast.

695
01:06:52,810 --> 01:06:53,650
The worm way.

696
01:06:53,850 --> 01:06:54,670
I guess I'll go here.

697
01:06:55,490 --> 01:06:56,090
Oh, no.

698
01:06:56,210 --> 01:06:56,530
No!

699
01:06:56,990 --> 01:06:57,410
Okay.

700
01:06:59,550 --> 01:07:00,230
No!

701
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:05,260
Guys, I'm okay.

702
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:08,520
I just keep wall grabbing for no reason!

703
01:07:13,890 --> 01:07:14,970
Up and up?

704
01:07:16,070 --> 01:07:16,850
Where's up?

705
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:18,910
Oh my god, where am I?

706
01:07:19,330 --> 01:07:20,250
I'm so lost.

707
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,860
I just keep grabbing the sidewalk.

708
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:28,200
So annoying.

709
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:32,280
Wait, upwards?

710
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:33,580
I can't even go up.

711
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:37,840
go up a different way?

712
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:40,020
Right for...

713
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:41,180
Oh my gosh, I didn't even see him.

714
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:43,000
Right for now, okay.

715
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,600
Yeah, because I'm gonna...

716
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:47,820
Oh, these...

717
01:07:47,820 --> 01:07:50,140
These fuckers!

718
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:53,300
Okay, I need to farm them.

719
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:03,220
Wait, where is...

720
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:06,000
Oh, no, this is... Oh, this is another of these.

721
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:07,700
Go down?

722
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:08,400
Okay.

723
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:12,600
Alright, down.

724
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,080
What the fuck?

725
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:18,960
Where am I?

726
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:20,920
Where is this place?

727
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,320
I've been here before?

728
01:08:28,780 --> 01:08:29,740
Greater down.

729
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:30,960
I'm like, where is this?

730
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:32,340
I don't think I've been here before.

731
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:34,920
I'm worried about going two down.

732
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:37,620
Oh, I'm going two down.

733
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:39,640
Oh, I'm going two down, guys.

734
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:41,460
Guys, I'm going two down!

735
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:42,340
Oh.

736
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:45,940
Where am I now?

737
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,220
Is this place?

738
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:49,720
Money!

739
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:53,880
Oh.

740
01:08:57,620 --> 01:08:59,660
Alright, I guess I entered this house.

741
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:01,400
This scary house.

742
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:04,540
It's a home invasion of the scariest house ever.

743
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:06,300
Oh!

744
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:07,900
I'm home invading a church!

745
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,040
Oh yeah, that makes it a lot better.

746
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:12,500
Oh, shit.

747
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:20,400
That's fine, it's just a little flesh wound.

748
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:30,080
Ha ha!

749
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:31,360
That took you right.

750
01:09:31,540 --> 01:09:32,700
I knew your plans.

751
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:34,560
I know what you are.

752
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:37,340
You're a coward.

753
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:40,260
Oh, no.

754
01:09:41,340 --> 01:09:42,260
Oh, no.

755
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:44,340
Oh, no.

756
01:09:45,660 --> 01:09:46,400
Fuck it.

757
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:47,850
Just Adi does it.

758
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:54,540
Alright, let's fight these monks with no battle training whatsoever.

759
01:09:55,340 --> 01:09:57,600
Their faith will guide them the victory.

760
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:01,460
Toki, they have their faith!

761
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,180
Alright, yeah.

762
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:06,900
Maybe if they believe hard enough, they can do one damage to me.

763
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:11,240
Oh, I do have...

764
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:12,340
No, I don't have my minds.

765
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:13,500
I didn't equip it.

766
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:18,540
Wait, what the fuck?

767
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:19,360
Adias!

768
01:10:24,340 --> 01:10:25,580
Oh my god, they did it.

769
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:26,660
See, I told you!

770
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:28,380
If they believe hard enough!

771
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:32,720
Oh my god, wait, they actually had me in the corner.

772
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:39,660
Oh my god, their faith is- their faith build is working!

773
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:41,780
Their faith build is actually working!

774
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:42,720
Okay, no, never mind.

775
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:44,240
It was false hope.

776
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:46,100
It was a false prophet.

777
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:51,800
Okay, we need to do that.

778
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:52,760
That's a shortcut.

779
01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:54,980
And they're believing...

780
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:56,200
They're believing too hard!

781
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:57,200
Stop them!

782
01:10:58,920 --> 01:10:59,920
What's this?

783
01:11:02,220 --> 01:11:03,760
Let's kill this burrito.

784
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:19,000
Cut swiftly and nimbly with short, precise strike.

785
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:20,040
Okay, what's this?

786
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:28,900
What is this?

787
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:31,140
Oh,

788
01:11:38,410 --> 01:11:38,810
go!

789
01:11:39,450 --> 01:11:40,510
Oh, my god!

790
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:42,750
Now I'm calling that now.

791
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:48,890
I'm John Holliday It's time baby mode has success replayed a lot.

792
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:50,030
Let's go.

793
01:11:50,470 --> 01:11:54,210
I finally got my crutch Finally

794
01:11:58,210 --> 01:12:15,710
Finally I got my crutch Oh my god This is what dreams are made of this is what dreams are made of We did it.

795
01:12:16,510 --> 01:12:18,010
We're finally unhandicapped.

796
01:12:19,190 --> 01:12:20,270
It's just that easy.

797
01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:22,570
I can pogo now.

798
01:12:25,010 --> 01:12:26,530
Get out of here.

799
01:12:28,770 --> 01:12:29,890
Wait, actually, we need that.

800
01:12:30,830 --> 01:12:31,210
Yeah.

801
01:12:32,450 --> 01:12:34,410
Oh, I can quit as well?

802
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:36,450
Wait, that's insane.

803
01:12:37,930 --> 01:12:40,910
I think the only issue is that it's super short range, right?

804
01:12:42,350 --> 01:12:43,990
Go right to unlock a door.

805
01:12:46,390 --> 01:12:49,550
Yeah, this is me just using the hornet skin from all night.

806
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:56,180
Alright, unlock.

807
01:12:58,140 --> 01:13:00,220
Yeah, I felt super short range.

808
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:02,040
Hello.

809
01:13:03,660 --> 01:13:05,340
Oh, you're asking my permission?

810
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:08,080
Feeling curious, were you?

811
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:10,100
There's a vast graveyard.

812
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:15,680
I see most bugs die climbing the path, but see as many fell before the trek that had barely commenced.

813
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:17,240
Quangy.

814
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:19,940
Lost her lives to beast.

815
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:22,020
Or to lectern rotten.

816
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:24,740
Others were simply formed too frail.

817
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:28,780
At least those poor souls can get us thrusted together.

818
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:30,780
Death and death and death.

819
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:33,140
Eternal promise of eternal kingdom.

820
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:35,860
Eventually, it claims us all.

821
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:37,200
Okay.

822
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:38,640
Never mind.

823
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:47,580
Oh my god, I forgot it doesn't have my It doesn't have my, uh, any of my stuff equipped.

824
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:50,500
Oh, shit, look, there's the funeral.

825
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:50,940
Goodbye.

826
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:54,260
Oh, nice.

827
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:56,940
Alright.

828
01:13:57,420 --> 01:13:58,920
I don't even know that kid.

829
01:13:59,740 --> 01:14:02,360
It's like inviting, like, oh, wait, my shaman.

830
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:07,640
It's like inviting fucking Jerry from the office to come to your funeral.

831
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:12,260
Go attend the funeral.

832
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:14,720
my fault.

833
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:17,240
I don't even, I don't even know his name.

834
01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:18,500
What was his name?

835
01:14:18,780 --> 01:14:21,220
Guys, I will attend his funeral if I know his name.

836
01:14:21,340 --> 01:14:21,860
What was his name?

837
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:23,520
I bet none of you know his name.

838
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:30,720
I was paid to make his wish come true.

839
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:31,660
That's different.

840
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:32,320
Fine.

841
01:14:33,580 --> 01:14:34,980
Little pilgrim.

842
01:14:36,220 --> 01:14:38,500
What ritual calls you all together, pilgrim?

843
01:14:39,420 --> 01:14:43,460
Our brother, this poor wretch in my, oh my bro, he's dead.

844
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:45,140
Don't We don't need to call him a wretch.

845
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:47,580
That's pretty fucking messed up.

846
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:48,860
He's already dead.

847
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:54,240
We gather here to sing him farewell, and to Amar and our great loss.

848
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:59,200
Below us pilgrims, we aim our sights high and never weaver from our path.

849
01:14:59,660 --> 01:15:03,980
The loss of a brother or sister still stops our trembling limbs in place.

850
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:05,880
Sing brothers and sisters.

851
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:08,700
Sing and drown out this burdensome sorrow.

852
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:12,860
Sing out the name of this poor pilgrim whose journey had never begun.

853
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:14,680
Hmm.

854
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:17,800
We here knows the name of this little pilgrim.

855
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:19,420
Oh.

856
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:22,040
My.

857
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:24,220
Oh my god.

858
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:26,560
None of us even got his name!

859
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:29,280
Why am I here?

860
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:32,940
None of you even cared about this man.

861
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:34,260
This child.

862
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:39,660
Though this pilgrim's name has been lost.

863
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:41,460
So we sing.

864
01:15:42,420 --> 01:16:10,040
Sing for our brother who was down a devout death all his pains and torments left behind like the dust struck from a traveler's shawl farewell little pilgrim may your shell harden the path for others to tread that's so you guys didn't even know you guys didn't even bother to know his name until he's dead that's fuck at least i went out there and made his wish come true even though he died for it but i still did it

865
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:16,360
Grave of the nameless bug.

866
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:19,200
Okay, now where do we go?

867
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:22,660
Wait, what are we supposed to do now?

868
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:27,060
You do not care.

869
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:28,520
Don't lie.

870
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:31,540
I can see it in your faces.

871
01:16:35,020 --> 01:16:35,460
Oh, wait.

872
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:36,400
You need to kill us.

873
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:37,080
No!

874
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:40,280
I can go back to him.

875
01:16:40,620 --> 01:16:41,500
I care.

876
01:16:41,820 --> 01:16:43,620
You didn't even know his name.

877
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:53,780
Shellwood to Bellheart.

878
01:16:54,020 --> 01:16:55,520
What the fuck is Shellwood?

879
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:57,840
Oh, that's Shellwood.

880
01:16:58,840 --> 01:16:59,900
What do we do at Shellwood?

881
01:17:03,740 --> 01:17:04,580
Yeah, what?

882
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:08,040
Alright, let me...

883
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:10,160
I need to kill this one bug holding this.

884
01:17:16,850 --> 01:17:18,790
Okay, I need this bug to fly over.

885
01:17:18,850 --> 01:17:19,970
I know he's there.

886
01:17:20,670 --> 01:17:22,110
I literally saw him with my...

887
01:17:22,110 --> 01:17:22,670
Oh, there he is.

888
01:17:25,150 --> 01:17:25,910
There we go.

889
01:17:26,030 --> 01:17:26,910
I needed this.

890
01:17:28,450 --> 01:17:28,450
Nice.

891
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:30,330
Oh yeah, I need to, like, fix my...

892
01:17:30,330 --> 01:17:31,130
Got my wish.

893
01:17:33,170 --> 01:17:35,390
I need to fix my crush shit.

894
01:17:36,290 --> 01:17:37,210
Alright, compass.

895
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:46,480
And then...

896
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:47,680
I need Adidas.

897
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:50,680
Here we go.

898
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:55,620
The right top in shellward takes you to the top.

899
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:56,260
Alright.

900
01:17:58,820 --> 01:17:59,440
Where's that?

901
01:17:59,460 --> 01:18:00,240
Oh, here?

902
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:03,040
Okay, we gotta go here.

903
01:18:04,900 --> 01:18:06,420
We gotta take this away.

904
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,980
Okay, we gotta go take the tram.

905
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:12,320
Tram time.

906
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:16,640
Alright, let's get our nail upgrade.

907
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:17,680
Ada!

908
01:18:23,580 --> 01:18:23,900
Alright.

909
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:27,520
Show- Oh, wait, that's Bellheart.

910
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:28,700
Wrong area.

911
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:33,720
Alright.

912
01:18:34,660 --> 01:18:37,220
Gotta go who shall we?

913
01:18:45,660 --> 01:18:46,580
This way.

914
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:49,040
It's so weird.

915
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:50,900
I keep thinking I have double jump for some reason.

916
01:18:55,860 --> 01:18:57,320
And then we go this way.

917
01:18:57,860 --> 01:18:59,280
I think I have my GPS.

918
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:02,440
bug PS.

919
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:06,340
Why do I...

920
01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:07,540
I missed this way?

921
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:13,840
Okay.

922
01:19:13,860 --> 01:19:16,020
Then we go this way, and then this way.

923
01:19:17,180 --> 01:19:18,240
Alright, right side.

924
01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:20,120
That's a pogo feel?

925
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:20,620
I don't know.

926
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:22,080
I don't know about... Oh, what the fuck?

927
01:19:22,220 --> 01:19:22,920
Where are you doing here?

928
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:24,120
Who let you outside?

929
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:25,860
You didn't...

930
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:26,820
You forgot to wear your helmet.

931
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:29,020
Oh, my ma!

932
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:30,840
Look here, Miss Growno.

933
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:32,700
Very fascinating creature here.

934
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:35,380
All dead in bits now, but still good.

935
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:41,660
She takes the shape of the woods for her body, and her hair like bitter leaves.

936
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:43,740
Clever thinks new.

937
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:48,840
This creature is stacked to stake this territory here and attacked as I pass through.

938
01:19:49,540 --> 01:19:50,500
You should not linger long.

939
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:54,840
A tribe remains hidden among the branches, the skies and waiting to strike.

940
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:57,880
Oh, so the cutting out was done by you?

941
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:00,000
You gives her warm thanks.

942
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:02,460
Now you can expect this creature well.

943
01:20:02,660 --> 01:20:04,880
All its gooey insides and crunchy shell.

944
01:20:05,140 --> 01:20:07,720
Okay, maybe you should never be allowed outside.

945
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:08,820
I'm sorry, buddy.

946
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:13,840

Whoops.

949
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:00,060
It's a little faster, though.

950
01:21:01,980 --> 01:21:03,560
Okay, it's 2 p.m.

951
01:21:03,820 --> 01:21:05,200
There's no way he's hungry.

952
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:06,880
Wait, what the fuck?

953
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:09,980
Can I kill him?

954
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:13,600
I'm gonna try and kill him.

955
01:21:13,660 --> 01:21:14,080
Yeah, I can.

956
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:14,800
Thank god.

957
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:21,200
Oh my god, I don't know what he's barking about.

958
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:27,600

01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:19,240
And I was like, I need to go to work.

01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:25,040
So she's like, come back to bed, Alexander.

963
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:27,480
I'm like, come back to bed, Tokyo.

01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:32,780
Please, I wanna sleep in bed with you right now.

965
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:38,400
He's literally like barking at me from the stairs.

966
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:45,120
Mama's got to make that money.

967
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:49,560
It's so dark outside.

968
01:22:55,260 --> 01:22:56,860
So he was literally barking at the stairs.

969
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:59,200
Asking me to come back to bed.

970
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:02,020
What's this?

971
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:02,500
Okay.

972
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:04,580
Oh, hey.

973
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:05,540
It's a sleeve.

974
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:07,160
Back here, chat.

975
01:23:07,540 --> 01:23:09,920
I don't think there's supposed to be children.

976
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:11,700
This has to be a dog.

977
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:14,480
You just don't believe they're kids.

978
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:22,180
I should run, but also I'm scared.

979
01:23:23,300 --> 01:23:23,560
Oh, wait.

980
01:23:23,620 --> 01:23:24,440
I'm going backwards.

981
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:29,880
Yeah, but they're like, My child, our child.

982
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:31,860
Please save our children.

983
01:23:33,020 --> 01:23:38,240
It must be like children in a sense where like, you know, people treat their dogs as kids.

984
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:40,160
That's how I see it.

985
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:44,960
Okay.

986
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:46,620
know which way to go.

987
01:23:46,900 --> 01:23:47,460
I'll go to the secret.

988
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:48,120
Oh, it's money.

989
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:50,640
Now I know where it's where to go.

990
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,500
Are they dog or child?

991
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:57,300
Okay, I could probably do this.

992
01:23:58,500 --> 01:23:59,300
That's fine.

993
01:24:03,050 --> 01:24:11,910
I hate how, like, I, like, grasp I, like, accidentally grasp the um, the walls sometimes.

994
01:24:12,050 --> 01:24:12,750
It's so annoying.

995
01:24:16,170 --> 01:24:16,890
Oh, what?

996
01:24:17,170 --> 01:24:17,550
What?

997
01:24:20,210 --> 01:24:21,410
Oh, I have to hit.

998
01:24:21,570 --> 01:24:22,430
Oh, shit!

999
01:24:27,190 --> 01:24:29,390
I saw him come.

1000
01:24:29,510 --> 01:24:30,870
No, no, I'm back here.

1001
01:24:31,230 --> 01:24:32,350
I saw him coming down.

1002
01:24:32,430 --> 01:24:34,370
I was like, this does not look so good for me.

1003
01:24:34,470 --> 01:24:35,950
This does not look good.

1004
01:24:39,690 --> 01:24:40,990
I was going to get crushed.

1005
01:24:41,110 --> 01:24:42,730
It was literally a death machine.

1006
01:24:48,110 --> 01:24:48,910
Show him.

1007
01:24:51,310 --> 01:24:53,870
Yeah, they made me a dokey sandwich right there.

1008
01:24:55,550 --> 01:24:57,550
Has to be a chair here, right?

1009
01:24:58,430 --> 01:24:59,390
Is there a chair here?

1010
01:24:59,550 --> 01:25:00,330
Oh, it's all the way.

1011
01:25:00,390 --> 01:25:00,950
Oh, fuck it.

1012
01:25:00,970 --> 01:25:01,630
I'll take the chair.

1013
01:25:02,570 --> 01:25:04,410
We need a chair right now.

1014
01:25:05,910 --> 01:25:06,690
There you go.

1015
01:25:09,510 --> 01:25:10,570
I wish I...

1016
01:25:10,570 --> 01:25:16,870
The one thing I don't like at the moment is the tools has to be up RB.

1017
01:25:18,150 --> 01:25:20,750
I wish it was like a different...

1018
01:25:21,150 --> 01:25:22,230
a different button.

1019
01:25:23,190 --> 01:25:24,470
I can't re-bind that, right?

1020
01:25:25,070 --> 01:25:26,890
I'm like, what do I bind it with?

1021
01:25:27,570 --> 01:25:28,470
That's the thing.

1022
01:25:28,810 --> 01:25:30,850
There's not a lot of buttons on the controller.

1023
01:25:33,550 --> 01:25:34,510
Well, I unlocked a shortcut.

1024
01:25:35,050 --> 01:25:35,510
I have?

1025
01:25:42,650 --> 01:25:43,410
I can.

1026
01:25:44,070 --> 01:25:46,970
Okay, I think I want to I want to bind it something.

1027
01:25:47,070 --> 01:25:48,290
But then, like, I'm like, what?

1028
01:25:49,010 --> 01:25:52,050
I guess like, oh, I could have it bind it to.

1029
01:25:52,750 --> 01:25:53,510
Left trigger.

1030
01:25:55,770 --> 01:26:25,910
is that what option controller what is else oh it's for harpoon i don't have a harpoon yet i guess r3 maybe i don't know i just don't like i don't know i'll try i'll keep using the I was like, Harpoon, the fuck is that?

1031
01:26:26,110 --> 01:26:27,230
I've never seen the Harpoon yet.

1032
01:26:28,930 --> 01:26:28,950
Oh.

1033
01:26:29,810 --> 01:26:30,810
R3 is Taun?

1034
01:26:31,250 --> 01:26:32,050
Do I have a Taun?

1035
01:26:36,410 --> 01:26:38,190
What the fuck does the Taun do?

1036
01:26:39,890 --> 01:26:41,330
Adoki is Taun's.

1037
01:26:41,390 --> 01:26:42,630
That's exactly what it does.

1038
01:26:42,810 --> 01:26:43,770
But like, what's the point?

1039
01:26:44,330 --> 01:26:48,850
Like, it's

1040
01:26:54,350 --> 01:26:55,510
for aura farming.

1041
01:26:55,730 --> 01:26:57,530
You'd understand if you had aura.

1042
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:02,340
Where is he?

1043
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:04,540
Okay, I was gonna say where the fuck is he?

1044
01:27:08,980 --> 01:27:12,100
Okay, I want to find this guy for a string just in case.

1045
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:14,200
Just in case I don't make it.

1046
01:27:14,380 --> 01:27:14,740
You know?

1047
01:27:23,470 --> 01:27:23,870
Goodbye.

1048
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:30,330
I just float any part of the way, water, water.

1049
01:27:31,230 --> 01:27:33,710
Any part of the way, water, water.

1050
01:27:40,150 --> 01:28:11,610

1051
01:28:14,910 --> 01:28:16,990
I did the same thing.

1052
01:28:17,370 --> 01:28:18,710
My, where is my...

1053
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:20,450
Wait, did I grab my...

1054
01:28:20,450 --> 01:28:21,430
Oh, I already grabbed it.

1055
01:28:21,490 --> 01:28:23,010
I don't even know when I grabbed it.

1056
01:28:29,660 --> 01:28:31,140
Keep going down, buddy.

1057
01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:33,420
Keep going down, buddy.

1058
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:36,360
Keep going down.

1059
01:28:37,820 --> 01:28:38,380
God,

1060
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:46,160
you fucker!

1061
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:51,040
I'm gonna kill him.

1062
01:28:56,980 --> 01:29:01,540
I hate- I don't know why I keep accidentally, um, oh shit.

1063
01:29:04,020 --> 01:29:09,180
I just keep accidentally pressing, uh, like holding onto the walls.

1064
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:09,780
It's so annoying.

1065
01:29:18,540 --> 01:29:19,520
Wait, what?

1066
01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:23,340
Am I missing something?

1067
01:29:27,940 --> 01:29:31,100
I keep accidentally, like, walking into the walls.

1068
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:33,480
What?

1069
01:29:46,610 --> 01:29:48,430
Yeah, I'm outta here.

1070
01:29:49,730 --> 01:29:50,590
There we go.

1071
01:29:54,070 --> 01:29:55,170
Breakable- oh, here!

1072
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:56,190
I didn't see that!

1073
01:30:00,810 --> 01:30:02,190
I know you're breakable.

1074
01:30:03,510 --> 01:30:04,010
Alright.

1075
01:30:06,910 --> 01:30:08,090
Oh, there's another breakable wall.

1076
01:30:08,970 --> 01:30:09,950
Wait, which way do I go?

1077
01:30:10,350 --> 01:30:12,050
We'll go this breakable wall first.

1078
01:30:12,330 --> 01:30:12,870
Oh!

1079
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:19,140
I'm so nervous.

1080
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:21,940
I'm so paranoid right now.

1081
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:27,780
Like, I'm really paranoid over everything at the moment.

1082
01:30:28,060 --> 01:30:29,760
It feels like...

1083
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:32,000
It's just death everywhere.

1084
01:30:34,540 --> 01:30:35,100
Are you serious?

1085
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:36,520
Are you serious?

1086
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:41,840
I'm not used to how short the range is now.

1087
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:47,480
I'm not used to it at all.

1088
01:30:48,580 --> 01:30:50,860
Yeah, I just wanted to share what that is.

1089
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:54,860
Because like, her default is so...

1090
01:30:54,860 --> 01:30:55,840
It's so long.

1091
01:30:57,080 --> 01:30:58,080
Get down.

1092
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:00,420
Oh, what the fuck you live that?

1093
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:07,800
I'm so used to the far range of her regular weapons.

1094
01:31:09,640 --> 01:31:11,280
Okay, here's the shortcut.

1095
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:15,180
Can I go up?

1096
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:16,040
Oh, I can.

1097
01:31:20,540 --> 01:31:21,740
But Pogom!

1098
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:27,080
Yeah, I know, but it's just, it's such a short range.

1099
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:29,060
Wait.

1100
01:31:30,340 --> 01:31:32,060
I messed up.

1101
01:31:35,060 --> 01:31:36,680
I'll go down now.

1102
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:40,200
I know, sir, you're blocking it.

1103
01:31:42,700 --> 01:31:43,980
I gotta parkour that.

1104
01:31:45,460 --> 01:31:46,940
Oh, there, that's how.

1105
01:31:46,940 --> 01:31:50,970
I don't know why I keep thinking I can...

1106
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:55,740
What the... Oh my god, it's a creepy fucking basis.

1107
01:31:58,520 --> 01:31:59,360
There you go.

1108
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:02,000
What's this?

1109
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:03,740
Oh, more money.

1110
01:32:06,740 --> 01:32:07,320
Actually...

1111
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:07,740
Yeah,

1112
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:12,000
I wanted to...

1113
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,960
Actually, I'll farm you for silk real quick.

1114
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:16,200
Just in case.

1115
01:32:16,940 --> 01:32:20,200
I don't trust the going down part.

1116
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:25,940
The going down part seems very dangerous.

1117
01:32:35,950 --> 01:32:37,510
Alright, then I'll not go.

1118
01:32:39,510 --> 01:32:41,490
Oh, there's a lot of music right now.

1119
01:32:42,050 --> 01:32:42,330
Hello?

1120
01:32:45,290 --> 01:32:45,890
Friendly?

1121
01:32:47,510 --> 01:32:49,430
Oh, she does not seem friendly.

1122
01:32:50,170 --> 01:32:51,670
She seems very mean.

1123
01:32:52,830 --> 01:32:54,410
She looks like a Karen.

1124
01:33:00,650 --> 01:33:02,290
I don't think she fun.

1125
01:33:03,570 --> 01:33:05,070
And I don't think I can leave.

1126
01:33:06,130 --> 01:33:07,970
I don't think I can leave.

1127
01:33:09,370 --> 01:33:11,570
I should have swapped my stuff.

1128
01:33:12,610 --> 01:33:14,510
Oh, um, they shall join.

1129
01:33:14,810 --> 01:33:16,210
Union upon your thread.

1130
01:33:16,630 --> 01:33:18,030
A gift for your waking.

1131
01:33:18,430 --> 01:33:20,170
A world strong to serve.

1132
01:33:20,710 --> 01:33:23,410
Creature, your claws guide those cursed threads.

1133
01:33:23,550 --> 01:33:24,570
But you are not the source.

1134
01:33:24,970 --> 01:33:25,730
What role do you play?

1135
01:33:25,750 --> 01:33:27,150
in this vile affliction.

1136
01:33:29,950 --> 01:33:30,710
Huh!

1137
01:33:31,210 --> 01:33:32,330
She is here.

1138
01:33:32,750 --> 01:33:36,770
The rare birthling precious child of worm and weaver.

1139
01:33:37,910 --> 01:33:39,770
Spawn of those who dare to flee.

1140
01:33:40,210 --> 01:33:43,010
She has found her way home at last.

1141
01:33:43,850 --> 01:33:47,010
How fine her shell and silk and claw.

1142
01:33:47,430 --> 01:33:50,990
For you mother, let me claim her all for you.

1143
01:33:51,830 --> 01:33:52,210
What?

1144
01:33:53,270 --> 01:33:54,030
What?

1145
01:33:55,750 --> 01:33:57,390
Yeah, I'm dead.

1146
01:33:57,850 --> 01:33:59,290
I'm so dead.

1147
01:34:02,630 --> 01:34:03,790
Oh my god.

1148
01:34:04,230 --> 01:34:05,490
Oh my what?

1149
01:34:06,030 --> 01:34:06,250
What?

1150
01:34:06,690 --> 01:34:07,950
What going on?

1151
01:34:08,210 --> 01:34:08,390
What?

1152
01:34:13,870 --> 01:34:14,350
All right.

1153
01:34:14,930 --> 01:34:15,550
Okay, cool.

1154
01:34:15,850 --> 01:34:16,590
That's that's sweet.

1155
01:34:17,270 --> 01:34:21,450
That's every everything was going on.

1156
01:34:21,950 --> 01:34:24,510
Yeah, that sounds about right.

1157
01:34:25,150 --> 01:34:25,730
All right.

1158
01:34:28,250 --> 01:34:31,930
I felt like they just, everything was just there.

1159
01:34:37,370 --> 01:34:38,130
I don't know.

1160
01:34:39,130 --> 01:34:40,750
I don't know.

1161
01:34:41,690 --> 01:34:43,930
I mean, it doesn't really matter what I put here.

1162
01:34:44,030 --> 01:34:46,830
I don't even have much of anything.

1163
01:34:47,130 --> 01:34:48,170
I'll just use the compass.

1164
01:34:48,790 --> 01:34:49,530
Oh, fuck.

1165
01:34:51,190 --> 01:34:51,830
Okay.

1166
01:34:56,530 --> 01:34:58,390

1167
01:35:02,110 --> 01:35:04,510

01:35:35,340 --> 01:35:41,720
all right down I'll go back to Help.

1171
01:35:42,100 --> 01:35:44,420
Maybe I can like live for five more seconds.

1172
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:45,380
I don't know.

1173
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:55,280
Maybe if I'm lucky, I can live five more seconds.

1174
01:35:56,700 --> 01:35:56,980
Truly.

1175
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:01,480
I know it's crazy to think about.

1176
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:05,880
Oh my god.

1177
01:36:06,440 --> 01:36:07,780
I don't know.

1178
01:36:08,180 --> 01:36:10,120
I don't know.

1179
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:16,920
Oh, shit.

1180
01:36:17,160 --> 01:36:18,340
Okay, I need to remember that does that.

1181
01:36:25,090 --> 01:36:26,310
What the fuck?

1182
01:36:30,380 --> 01:36:31,180
Oh, shit.

1183
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:32,120
That was my bad.

1184
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:37,160
Okay.

1185
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:39,840
Jesus Christ, so many.

1186
01:36:40,260 --> 01:36:41,160
I'm stoked.

1187
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:44,280
There's just too many things going on.

1188
01:36:46,740 --> 01:36:47,700
There's too many.

1189
01:36:49,460 --> 01:36:51,100
What the fuck is that?

1190
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:56,900
Okay.

1191
01:36:58,060 --> 01:36:59,260
Jesus Christ!

1192
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:03,600
Jesus.

1193
01:37:07,720 --> 01:37:11,860
I need to remember that's what it does.

1194
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:13,560
Okay.

1195
01:37:15,860 --> 01:37:16,940
Alright.

1196
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:20,780
That's fine.

1197
01:37:21,780 --> 01:37:22,440
I guess.

1198
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:24,160
That's not fine.

1199
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:24,420
No.

1200
01:37:25,100 --> 01:37:25,400
No.

1201
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:29,600
There you go.

1202
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:30,320
Friend!

1203
01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:32,800
Oh, I'm lucky.

1204
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:41,700
That's not fair.

1205
01:37:50,740 --> 01:37:50,740
Nice.

1206
01:37:51,120 --> 01:37:51,880
Okay, second try.

1207
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:52,800
Alright, there we go.

1208
01:37:53,320 --> 01:37:55,440
Here we go.

1209
01:37:55,720 --> 01:37:56,440
Wait, what?

1210
01:37:56,900 --> 01:37:58,160
What do you mean?

1211
01:37:58,580 --> 01:38:01,720
I was like, cool, second try.

1212
01:38:04,060 --> 01:38:07,720
JK, there's actually second phase.

1213
01:38:07,940 --> 01:38:08,720
Ha ha ha.

1214
01:38:09,980 --> 01:38:12,820
You really thought it was that easy?

1215
01:38:20,020 --> 01:38:20,300
Okay.

1216
01:38:21,560 --> 01:38:22,280
Oh my god.

1217
01:38:22,460 --> 01:38:23,420
Okay, that's on me.

1218
01:38:25,020 --> 01:38:26,060
That's on me.

1219
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:27,900
Oh my god, it's fine, guys.

1220
01:38:31,180 --> 01:38:32,900
Oh my god, there's so many balls.

1221
01:38:35,020 --> 01:38:36,560
Too many, too many balls!

1222
01:38:40,840 --> 01:38:42,340
My eyes are not.

1223
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:44,800
There's too many balls on my screen.

1224
01:38:45,320 --> 01:38:48,500
There's There's actually too many balls on the screen.

1225
01:38:49,340 --> 01:38:50,660
Okay, I gotta focus.

1226
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:52,000
I was like, yay!

1227
01:38:54,540 --> 01:38:55,980
Too many cooks?

1228
01:38:56,120 --> 01:38:57,420
Oh my god, are you serious?

1229
01:38:59,160 --> 01:39:00,000
Fuck you.

1230
01:39:01,900 --> 01:39:03,700
The random bullshit go!

1231
01:39:04,580 --> 01:39:07,620
Yeah, the random bullshit was not...

1232
01:39:07,620 --> 01:39:09,920
I don't know if I want to keep the bag.

1233
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:12,580
I'm trying to think if I want to keep Pogo.

1234
01:39:13,540 --> 01:39:15,000
Fuck you, let's swap Chris.

1235
01:39:18,460 --> 01:39:35,600
I don't know that I think I want to do I'm going to do actually I'm going to do Reaper I'm going to trust my instinct I'm going to do Reaper today I am feeling really slow though in general

1236
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:51,000
I don't know if I want to do I'm going to do this just because I want more attack Ah, fuck it.

1237
01:39:56,090 --> 01:39:57,470
Yeah, that's why I won't do this.

1238
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:13,180
I don't think I need to unlock a second one, though.

1239
01:40:13,420 --> 01:40:14,320
That's the thing.

1240
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:19,960
Alright.

1241
01:40:31,060 --> 01:40:31,620
Alright.

1242
01:40:36,470 --> 01:40:38,890
Alright, I gotta adjust the speed, though.

1243
01:40:39,130 --> 01:40:41,210
That's so, that's only the worst part.

1244
01:40:42,290 --> 01:40:44,830
It's because every- it's now slower.

1245
01:40:45,930 --> 01:40:47,710
Everything feels slower now.

1246
01:40:47,970 --> 01:40:49,630
That's the only issue.

1247
01:40:52,530 --> 01:40:54,330
Oh my god, it's so slow.

1248
01:40:58,570 --> 01:40:59,210
Okay.

1249
01:41:00,050 --> 01:41:00,450

Okay.

1251

Nice.

1252
01:41:18,700 --> 01:41:20,760
Holy shit, that's so slow.

1253
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:23,000
So slow.

1254
01:41:27,320 --> 01:41:27,600
Okay.

1255
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:31,840
Oh my god, my attacks feel so slow!

1256
01:41:36,450 --> 01:41:37,010

1257
01:41:41,870 --> 01:41:42,430

1259
01:41:45,710 --> 01:41:46,930
That's so unlucky.

1260
01:42:01,300 --> 01:42:01,860
All right.

1261
01:42:04,360 --> 01:42:04,920
Nice.

1262
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:07,760

I need this.

1272
01:42:56,270 --> 01:42:57,290
It's so slow now.

1273
01:42:58,850 --> 01:43:00,590
I need more speed.

1274
01:43:02,470 --> 01:43:04,350
There's way too much random bullshit.

1275
01:43:08,070 --> 01:43:09,230
Oh, whoops.

01:43:09,450 --> 01:43:09,970

1277
01:43:10,970 --> 01:43:11,690
It's fine.

1278
01:43:11,950 --> 01:43:12,550
I'm okay.

I just gotta be...

1283
01:43:58,040 --> 01:44:00,020
I just gotta make my own speed.

01:44:05,430 --> 01:44:05,950
Alright.

1285
01:44:07,090 --> 01:44:08,510
Actually, I'll use that now.

1286
01:44:10,070 --> 01:44:11,510
Are you fucking kidding me?

1287
01:44:11,710 --> 01:44:12,550

1293
01:44:24,990 --> 01:44:26,270

1294
01:44:26,290 --> 01:44:27,170

1313
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:03,060
I don't know.

1314
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:07,220
All right.

1315
01:46:12,190 --> 01:46:12,510
Okay.

1316
01:46:13,650 --> 01:46:14,250
That's fine.

1317
01:46:14,330 --> 01:46:15,070
Now I'm fast.

1318
01:46:18,180 --> 01:46:20,000
Just as fast!

1319
01:46:22,060 --> 01:46:23,840
Oh shit, I need to remember that.

1320
01:46:24,740 --> 01:46:25,500
And why I forget.

1321
01:46:30,010 --> 01:46:30,490
Nice?

1322
01:46:32,710 --> 01:46:33,550
Okay.

1323
01:46:35,650 --> 01:46:38,330

01:46:43,420 --> 01:46:45,000

There we go.

1327
01:46:51,160 --> 01:46:52,040
Oh shit!

1328
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:54,780
That's on me though.

1329
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:56,980
That's just me being a little stupid.

1330
01:46:57,580 --> 01:47:02,700
Oh my god.

1331
01:47:03,280 --> 01:47:04,280
That's pretty magic.

1332
01:47:10,260 --> 01:47:11,240
Nope, no more.

1333
01:47:11,820 --> 01:47:12,720
Oh shit, I didn't realize.

1334
01:47:14,180 --> 01:47:15,420
I didn't even see him.

1335
01:47:22,390 --> 01:47:22,650
Okay.

1336
01:47:24,890 --> 01:47:25,410
When?

1337
01:47:26,870 --> 01:47:27,390
What?

1338
01:47:30,230 --> 01:47:32,990
I don't know how that fucking happened.

1339
01:47:35,070 --> 01:47:35,510
Shit.

1340
01:47:42,390 --> 01:47:43,610
Oh my god.

1341
01:47:44,370 --> 01:47:46,090
I'm just being stupid.

1342
01:47:48,370 --> 01:47:48,970
Get back here!

1343
01:47:49,050 --> 01:47:50,590
I need my farm, my magic!

1344
01:47:53,710 --> 01:47:55,750
How am I supposed to farm my magic?

1345
01:47:55,870 --> 01:47:56,590
You keep running!

1346
01:47:57,190 --> 01:47:58,170
There we go.

1347
01:48:01,530 --> 01:48:02,850
Alright, random bullshit.

1348
01:48:02,870 --> 01:48:03,970
Okay, focus.

1349
01:48:06,550 --> 01:48:07,110
Starting now!

1350
01:48:07,890 --> 01:48:10,950
Oh no, I knew it.

1351
01:48:11,870 --> 01:48:13,530
Oh my, oh my god, never mind.

1352
01:48:13,750 --> 01:48:14,830
Not starting now, apparently.

1353
01:48:15,430 --> 01:48:15,930
Not now.

1354
01:48:16,270 --> 01:48:16,590
Not now.

1355
01:48:16,950 --> 01:48:17,230
I lied.

1356
01:48:18,430 --> 01:48:19,550
It's not now.

1357
01:48:20,730 --> 01:48:22,770
It's absolutely not now.

1358
01:48:27,640 --> 01:48:27,900
Okay.

1359
01:48:33,230 --> 01:48:34,450
Okay, there you go.

1360
01:48:37,710 --> 01:48:38,850
Jesus Christ.

1361
01:48:42,650 --> 01:48:45,870
Oh my god.

1362
01:48:53,880 --> 01:48:54,240
It's fine.

1363
01:48:54,840 --> 01:48:55,600
This is where I want to be.

1364
01:48:56,120 --> 01:48:59,280
Not really, but this is the best it's gonna get.

1365
01:49:10,450 --> 01:49:10,950
Realize.

1366
01:49:11,410 --> 01:49:12,390
Okay, we're fine.

1367
01:49:12,550 --> 01:49:13,630
Okay, we'll try hunting Chris.

1368
01:49:14,910 --> 01:49:15,950
I'm trying them all.

1369
01:49:16,670 --> 01:49:18,870
I didn't even realize I was wall ground.

1370
01:49:19,630 --> 01:49:21,450
I was looking at the guys.

1371
01:49:21,450 --> 01:49:24,770
I was looking...

1372
01:49:24,770 --> 01:49:26,570
Well, dude, I like the speed, though.

1373
01:49:26,730 --> 01:49:27,570
The speed was good.

1374
01:49:27,730 --> 01:49:28,970
The panic, yeah.

1375
01:49:29,290 --> 01:49:30,450
I didn't know!

1376
01:49:33,270 --> 01:49:35,450
I didn't know I was walking!

1377
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:43,840
I was too busy looking at him!

1378
01:49:52,140 --> 01:49:52,580
Damn.

1379
01:49:52,780 --> 01:49:55,200
I don't know if I could pogo him, though, with this.

1380
01:50:06,510 --> 01:50:07,170
Fast juice.

1381
01:50:09,810 --> 01:50:10,590
Oh, my God.

1382
01:50:10,670 --> 01:50:11,650
God, no, I don't like this.

1383
01:50:12,670 --> 01:50:14,050
No, oh my god.

1384
01:50:14,370 --> 01:50:15,430
I'm much more disoriented.

1385
01:50:15,810 --> 01:50:16,190
Never mind.

1386
01:50:16,610 --> 01:50:24,230
Never Never mind It's worse I don't know how to put oh my god.

1387
01:50:24,390 --> 01:50:36,890
It's so much worse It's actually It's so much I'm not okay I'm not okay Never mind.

1388
01:50:37,470 --> 01:50:39,510
I No hunter crest.

1389
01:50:39,690 --> 01:50:40,830
No hunter crest.

1390
01:50:41,150 --> 01:50:48,590
I've learned I It was not, I forgot what it was like with the diagonal.

1391
01:50:49,310 --> 01:50:50,790
I, I forgot.

1392
01:50:51,810 --> 01:50:53,090
Okay, we'll try one day.

1393
01:50:53,430 --> 01:50:54,970
We're trying all the flimsy.

1394
01:50:55,130 --> 01:50:57,090
I was not okay with that.

1395
01:50:57,430 --> 01:51:01,330
That actually, I was like, I was like, oh, I missed.

1396
01:51:06,410 --> 01:51:08,950
It's been so long, guys, you don't understand.

1397
01:51:09,130 --> 01:51:12,650
It's been so long since I, since I hopped diagonally.

1398
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:20,560
It's because of muscle memory.

1399
01:51:20,740 --> 01:51:22,580
I was not used to going there.

1400
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:24,140
I was like, where am I?

1401
01:51:24,700 --> 01:51:28,060
I was really like, where did I go?

1402
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:31,180
Okay.

1403
01:51:34,890 --> 01:51:35,470
What?

1404
01:51:37,090 --> 01:51:38,650
How did that hit me?

1405
01:51:41,090 --> 01:51:42,650
Okay, I'm gonna...

1406
01:51:43,330 --> 01:51:44,570
That's so not fair.

1407
01:51:45,170 --> 01:51:46,250
That's actually not fair.

1408
01:51:46,270 --> 01:51:49,510
That is not, I'm, oh, what's going on?

1409
01:51:53,230 --> 01:51:54,930
Guys, I don't know what's going on.

1410
01:51:55,110 --> 01:51:56,010
I don't know.

1411
01:51:57,670 --> 01:52:01,550
Ever since I swapped my crest, it's all downhill.

1412
01:52:02,090 --> 01:52:05,150
Okay, I told you guys, today is an off day for me.

1413
01:52:05,610 --> 01:52:07,010

Okay, now I focus.

1417

I'm locked out again.

1462
01:56:59,200 --> 01:56:59,900
I'm locked out.

1463
01:57:00,140 --> 01:57:01,180
I'm locked out.

1464
01:57:01,560 --> 01:57:08,560
I think I need caffeine.

1465
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:09,220
Oh, no!

1466
01:57:10,620 --> 01:57:12,140
I think I need caffeine.

1467
01:57:12,340 --> 01:57:13,820
My eyes feel so heavy.

1468
01:57:18,120 --> 01:57:19,540

You don't need caffeine.

1470
01:57:21,720 --> 01:57:22,840
Guys, I don't know what's wrong.

1471
01:57:23,640 --> 01:57:25,140
I don't know what's around with me.

1472
01:57:29,220 --> 01:57:30,880
I'm locked in that gate.

1473
01:57:31,140 --> 01:57:32,060
Don't look at me.

1474
01:57:32,500 --> 01:57:33,380
Don't look at me.

1475
01:57:33,540 --> 01:57:34,860

I agree.

1480
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:53,620
Sometimes when too fast, my brain.

1481
01:57:53,640 --> 01:57:55,200
just don't know what to look at.

1482
01:57:56,560 --> 01:57:57,780
I'm just too fast.

01:58:04,420 --> 01:58:05,480
Okay, that's fine.

1484
01:58:09,180 --> 01:58:11,360
I didn't even press it!

1485
01:58:14,240 --> 01:58:16,180
Okay, that's fine, I guess.

1486
01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:20,100
I swear to God, I didn't even press it.

1487
01:58:27,700 --> 01:58:29,500
Oh my God, of course you're in front of me.

1488
01:58:31,240 --> 01:58:40,290

01:59:16,920 --> 01:59:19,440
Guys, I think it's time to bring back the Reaper.

1493
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:21,940
It's actually my best run.

1494
01:59:28,810 --> 01:59:30,310
Okay, I don't trust myself anymore.

1495
01:59:30,590 --> 01:59:31,130
I don't!

1496
01:59:33,610 --> 01:59:37,450
I just locked in directly into the bells.

1497
01:59:38,250 --> 01:59:38,450
All right.

1498
01:59:39,310 --> 01:59:41,110
My best run was the Reaper.

1499
01:59:44,770 --> 01:59:45,370
Yeah.

1500
01:59:45,550 --> 02:00:12,880

Why?

1511
02:01:04,700 --> 02:01:04,720
Why?

1512
02:01:04,980 --> 02:01:05,660
Why?

1513
02:01:05,660 --> 02:01:11,330

No!

1521
02:01:36,580 --> 02:01:39,860
He always uses the moves I just don't expect.

1522
02:01:49,200 --> 02:01:49,500

I didn't even know it could bounce against...

1528
02:02:39,870 --> 02:02:41,450
Today's not a good day for Doki.

1529
02:02:45,170 --> 02:02:50,670
Prime Doki would have killed that boss like 30 minutes ago.

1530
02:02:50,850 --> 02:02:52,050
Can you stop?

1531
02:02:53,870 --> 02:02:57,210
Prime Doki would have killed her 30 minutes ago.

1532
02:02:57,410 --> 02:02:58,950
This is not prime.

1533
02:02:59,050 --> 02:03:00,350

Don't you keep saying you're fine, but we don't know.

1575
02:05:21,160 --> 02:05:21,760
We...

1576
02:05:24,320 --> 02:05:26,320

I'm so okay with my situation.

1579
02:05:36,320 --> 02:05:38,280
I'm so okay.

1580
02:05:38,840 --> 02:05:40,300
I'm so healthy.

1581
02:05:44,900 --> 02:05:45,220
Okay.

1582
02:05:47,240 --> 02:05:48,280
Okay.

1583
02:05:51,930 --> 02:05:53,570
Oh, my god.

1584
02:05:53,690 --> 02:05:54,870
That's nice.

1585
02:05:55,870 --> 02:05:57,630
It was so fine.

1586
02:05:58,110 --> 02:05:59,450
If you say...

1587
02:05:59,470 --> 02:06:03,730
Yeah, yeah, if you say so, you definitely sound so fine.

1588
02:06:10,310 --> 02:06:10,870
Okay.

1589
02:06:12,170 --> 02:06:17,970
I try to say I'm locked in, but, like, I think I locked myself in the wrong side of the door.

1590
02:06:20,330 --> 02:06:21,170
You're right.

1591
02:06:21,430 --> 02:06:22,950
There's only one thing.

1592
02:06:24,290 --> 02:06:25,990
Now I'm locked in.

1593
02:06:26,150 --> 02:06:27,410
Please, dad, please.

1594
02:06:27,490 --> 02:06:29,170
I'm not okay right now.

1595
02:06:29,470 --> 02:06:34,030
Oh my

1596
02:06:37,700 --> 02:06:38,140
god.

1597
02:06:38,860 --> 02:06:43,140
Please, dad, please, I'm not having a good day!

1598
02:06:47,920 --> 02:06:52,800
Oh my god.

1599
02:06:54,940 --> 02:06:55,320
What?

1600
02:07:00,620 --> 02:07:02,660
I like to speak to your manager!

1601
02:07:08,810 --> 02:07:09,690
Okay.

1602
02:07:13,870 --> 02:07:16,250
I like to speak to her manager, please.

1603
02:07:23,170 --> 02:07:23,690
All right.

1604
02:07:27,130 --> 02:07:27,970
Okay, that's fine.

1605
02:07:28,170 --> 02:07:29,850
It gave me a little bit of strength.

1606
02:07:36,410 --> 02:07:37,050
All right.

1607
02:07:38,770 --> 02:07:41,470
I think I actually have to just focus up and stop yapping.

1608
02:07:42,390 --> 02:07:44,190
This is the only way.

1609
02:07:51,240 --> 02:07:51,980
That's fine.

1610
02:07:55,590 --> 02:07:56,110
Good.

1611
02:08:01,120 --> 02:08:04,260
There we go.

1612
02:08:06,820 --> 02:08:07,380
Nice.

1613
02:08:07,800 --> 02:08:08,100
Parried.

1614
02:08:15,220 --> 02:08:17,380
I sure do love getting hit by the residue.

1615
02:08:18,120 --> 02:08:18,560
Oh, yeah.

1616
02:08:18,940 --> 02:08:19,760
Fuck you.

1617
02:08:24,580 --> 02:08:24,840
Okay.

1618
02:08:26,540 --> 02:08:26,860
I

1619
02:08:32,740 --> 02:08:33,920
got how many bells?

1620
02:08:36,200 --> 02:08:38,060
I want the bell economy to crash me.

1621
02:08:38,080 --> 02:08:39,000
right now!

1622
02:08:51,150 --> 02:08:52,950
Jesus Christ, that was my bet.

1623
02:09:01,420 --> 02:09:02,660
Oh, fucking course.

1624
02:09:02,900 --> 02:09:04,260
Oh, fucking course she sends!

1625
02:09:13,970 --> 02:09:14,870
It's okay.

1626
02:09:15,710 --> 02:09:17,910
I go through this pain for you.

1627
02:09:18,150 --> 02:09:19,190
I do it for...

1628
02:09:19,770 --> 02:09:21,270
I do it for...

1629
02:09:21,270 --> 02:09:22,070
Do it for them.

1630
02:09:22,450 --> 02:09:22,750
I...

1631
02:09:27,570 --> 02:09:27,990
Alright.

1632
02:09:30,030 --> 02:09:37,010
Guys, yeah, the boss is just trying to make you guys remember to ring that notification bell if you want to get more content just for like this.

1633
02:09:43,820 --> 02:09:45,720
Focus up, focus up, focus up, don't keep.

1634
02:09:47,240 --> 02:09:48,380
Don't let them win.

1635
02:09:49,540 --> 02:09:50,060
You're tired.

1636
02:09:50,460 --> 02:09:53,320
You're tired and today's not your day, but don't let them win.

1637
02:09:57,240 --> 02:09:58,000
Really?

1638
02:09:58,800 --> 02:09:59,060
Really?

1639
02:10:09,030 --> 02:10:09,790
Why?

1640
02:10:14,310 --> 02:10:14,690
Okay.

1641
02:10:18,070 --> 02:10:18,070
Alright.

1642
02:10:18,750 --> 02:10:19,110
That's good?

1643
02:10:21,490 --> 02:10:23,650
Oh my god, that's just me being stupid.

1644
02:10:28,840 --> 02:10:30,240
Let me get one more slash.

1645
02:10:32,340 --> 02:10:32,720
Nice.

1646
02:10:35,020 --> 02:10:35,780
Nice.

1647
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:36,640
Full magic now.

1648
02:10:40,650 --> 02:10:41,750
Oh my god.

1649
02:10:42,930 --> 02:10:44,130
Oh my god.

1650
02:10:46,850 --> 02:10:47,150
Okay.

1651
02:10:50,760 --> 02:10:51,540
No, not fair.

1652
02:10:51,660 --> 02:10:54,280
She was body blocking the only way!

1653
02:10:57,240 --> 02:10:58,580
That was actually bullshit.

1654
02:11:01,200 --> 02:11:02,320
I got this.

1655
02:11:09,400 --> 02:11:10,800
I swear to God.

1656
02:11:10,960 --> 02:11:12,140
I swear to God, that bell hits me.

1657
02:11:12,240 --> 02:11:14,120
I swear to God.

1658
02:11:15,600 --> 02:11:17,280
She interrupts?

1659
02:11:17,380 --> 02:11:18,820
She can interrupt that?

1660
02:11:21,520 --> 02:11:24,020
No, I'm no longer locked in.

1661
02:11:24,840 --> 02:11:27,740
She can interrupt it with her yell?

1662
02:11:28,600 --> 02:11:30,480
I didn't know that!

1663
02:11:32,380 --> 02:11:34,660
I didn't know she can't...

1664
02:11:34,660 --> 02:11:37,380
I didn't know.

1665
02:11:37,900 --> 02:11:42,060
She can cancel you because she yelled a little loud.

1666
02:11:42,360 --> 02:11:44,980
She just decides to yell at me.

1667
02:11:46,160 --> 02:11:47,980
Now you know.

1668
02:11:50,560 --> 02:11:54,080
I was using Skull out because I wanted to farm my magic.

1669
02:11:58,960 --> 02:12:00,420
Oh my god.

1670
02:12:01,260 --> 02:12:02,840
I can't believe it.

1671
02:12:04,040 --> 02:12:06,240
She can actually do that.

1672
02:12:07,960 --> 02:12:10,440
We live in such a fucked up world.

1673
02:12:11,020 --> 02:12:13,000
The world is so fucked up.

1674
02:12:16,280 --> 02:12:18,260
The world is so cruel.

1675
02:12:22,520 --> 02:12:25,520
Oh my god, sometimes I forgot like...

1676
02:12:28,900 --> 02:12:29,360
Oh,

1677
02:12:32,890 --> 02:12:34,050
I'm gonna poke her a little bit more.

1678
02:12:34,790 --> 02:12:35,290
That's fine.

1679
02:12:36,050 --> 02:12:37,370
I got some magic I need.

1680
02:12:39,730 --> 02:12:40,550
No, please don't disappear.

1681
02:12:41,270 --> 02:12:41,310
Nice.

1682
02:12:43,330 --> 02:12:43,790
Why?

1683
02:12:46,470 --> 02:12:47,550
Why are you running?

1684
02:12:55,640 --> 02:12:56,900
Oh my god, I'm still mad.

1685
02:12:59,880 --> 02:13:01,060
I'm so mad

1686
02:13:06,880 --> 02:13:13,600
Let me poke you Let me poke you Please!

1687
02:13:14,340 --> 02:13:25,160
Oh my god You let me poke you after I fucking used up my magic shit Such a little bitch You're such a little bitch

1688
02:13:33,620 --> 02:13:36,680
I swear to God that bell hits me I swear to God, that bell hits me.

1689
02:13:37,380 --> 02:13:39,080
Too many

1690
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:44,300
bells.

1691
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:45,740
Too many bells.

1692
02:13:48,020 --> 02:13:49,120
Too many bells.

1693
02:13:49,480 --> 02:13:51,940
What do I do?

1694
02:13:56,420 --> 02:13:57,660
Too many bells.

1695
02:13:58,160 --> 02:13:59,260
Too many bells.

1696
02:14:06,540 --> 02:14:07,620
My weakness.

1697
02:14:12,260 --> 02:14:14,040
My actual weakness.

1698
02:14:14,280 --> 02:14:15,800
It's the bells.

1699
02:14:16,560 --> 02:14:18,980
It's actually the bells.

1700
02:14:19,520 --> 02:14:19,920
Ah!

1701
02:14:20,700 --> 02:14:21,280
Ah!

1702
02:14:21,520 --> 02:14:24,220
It's like the boulders all over again.

1703
02:14:25,160 --> 02:14:26,440
It's the boulders.

1704
02:14:26,640 --> 02:14:27,680
You don't understand.

1705
02:14:28,300 --> 02:14:29,200
It's the boulders.

1706
02:14:29,380 --> 02:14:30,440
It's the boulders.

1707
02:14:30,620 --> 02:14:33,080
It's the boulders all over again.

1708
02:14:33,820 --> 02:14:34,260
It's...

1709
02:14:35,880 --> 02:14:38,660
It's like the fucking boulders.

1710
02:14:39,200 --> 02:14:40,860
You don't understand.

1711
02:14:41,400 --> 02:14:44,260
It's like the boulders from all over again.

1712

Okay.

1714
02:15:18,200 --> 02:15:20,120
A master of the first phase.

1715
02:15:21,560 --> 02:15:23,780
I'm gonna say that and I'm gonna die, aren't I?

1716
02:15:26,740 --> 02:15:28,380
You don't understand?

1717
02:15:29,560 --> 02:15:32,600
It's like the boulders, you don't understand.

1718
02:15:33,340 --> 02:15:34,280
The boulders...

1719
02:15:34,920 --> 02:15:37,180
The boulders were like so hard.

1720
02:15:39,040 --> 02:15:42,220
The boulders were like...

1721
02:15:43,180 --> 02:15:43,940
I...

1722
02:15:44,280 --> 02:15:47,440
I'm so sad I'm so sad

1723
02:15:51,180 --> 02:15:58,940
There's just something about the boulders It's just something about it

1724
02:16:06,940 --> 02:16:10,860
Okay All right

1725
02:16:23,300 --> 02:16:25,180

1727
02:16:44,700 --> 02:16:46,660

1728
02:16:47,620 --> 02:16:48,900
I press B!

1729
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:50,720
That's it.

1730
02:16:50,820 --> 02:16:51,940
I'm bringing it out.

1731
02:16:52,760 --> 02:16:54,300
I'm going beast mode.

1732
02:16:54,600 --> 02:16:56,000
I don't care anymore.

1733
02:16:56,920 --> 02:17:00,400
I- I-goes beast mode.

1734
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:07,920
There are bugs in my bug game.

1735
02:17:10,840 --> 02:17:12,820
I don't care no more.

1736
02:17:13,780 --> 02:17:15,840
I'm going beast mode.

1737
02:17:18,220 --> 02:17:19,900
The beast has been unleashed.

1738
02:17:20,320 --> 02:17:22,040
And it's going to be my worst run yet.

1739
02:17:29,340 --> 02:17:30,920
Wait, the dash is worse.

1740
02:17:33,600 --> 02:17:34,080
Wait.

1741
02:17:34,720 --> 02:17:35,620
Guys, wait.

1742
02:17:35,780 --> 02:17:37,160
The dash is worse, guys.

1743
02:17:37,600 --> 02:17:38,700
Wait a minute.

1744
02:17:39,760 --> 02:17:40,220
Wait.

1745
02:17:45,880 --> 02:17:46,740
Run!

1746
02:17:47,520 --> 02:17:47,580
Run!

1747
02:17:48,800 --> 02:17:49,000
Run!

1748
02:17:50,700 --> 02:17:52,800
I'm going beast mode!

1749
02:17:57,140 --> 02:17:59,380
I'm letting the beast out!

1750
02:18:13,740 --> 02:18:14,540
Oh my god.

1751
02:18:14,900 --> 02:18:17,460
This is the downward is not good for this.

1752
02:18:18,060 --> 02:18:19,600
The downward is not good.

1753
02:18:21,200 --> 02:18:22,060
Run!

1754
02:18:28,020 --> 02:18:29,920
I'm letting it all out!

1755
02:18:32,100 --> 02:18:33,720
Get over here!

1756
02:18:38,090 --> 02:18:42,550
Okay, maybe I shouldn't have let the beast out.

1757
02:18:44,320 --> 02:18:48,900
Maybe the beast was a bad idea.

1758
02:18:57,760 --> 02:18:59,280
Oh no, this is bad.

1759
02:18:59,380 --> 02:18:59,900
I'm 2 HP.

1760
02:19:00,660 --> 02:19:00,900
Whoops.

1761
02:19:06,820 --> 02:19:08,380
Are you serious?

1762
02:19:09,040 --> 02:19:11,180
Oh my god, they even get chance to go beast mode.

1763
02:19:11,500 --> 02:19:18,180
I just got...

1764
02:19:18,180 --> 02:19:20,040
Guys, beast modes was a bad idea.

1765
02:19:20,300 --> 02:19:20,920
I don't...

1766
02:19:20,920 --> 02:19:23,120
That was a last of judgment.

1767
02:19:23,600 --> 02:19:23,960
That was...

1768
02:19:26,760 --> 02:19:29,360
That was a last of judgment right there.

1769
02:19:29,480 --> 02:19:31,220
Maybe no more beast mode.

1770
02:19:31,760 --> 02:19:34,080
I let the beast down.

1771
02:19:34,460 --> 02:19:35,660
We gotta keep the beast back.

1772
02:19:35,680 --> 02:19:43,960
Into the cage the piece gets gonna go back in Knock me out of the beast has been caged

1773
02:19:55,240 --> 02:19:59,220

02:19:59,360 --> 02:20:01,480

1778
02:20:37,720 --> 02:20:38,200
Focus, focus.

1779

Okay.

1781
02:20:56,280 --> 02:20:58,560
Oh my god, that was me being very greedy.

1782
02:20:59,720 --> 02:21:00,920
That's not how it is.

1783
02:21:03,680 --> 02:21:05,620
Oh my god, wait, I could have just done that.

1784
02:21:06,880 --> 02:21:07,880

I swear to God, this is the quietest I'll ever be.

1788
02:22:27,820 --> 02:22:30,720
Look, today's my off day.

1789
02:23:15,160 --> 02:23:16,000

1792
02:23:47,770 --> 02:23:49,370
This might be dumb.

1793
02:23:50,090 --> 02:23:51,110
But I want magic.

1794
02:23:52,790 --> 02:23:54,750

but I just have to stop talking I just had to stop talking.

1801
02:25:38,740 --> 02:25:40,400
I had to stop yapping.

1802
02:25:41,220 --> 02:25:42,800
I'm so sad.

1803
02:25:43,300 --> 02:25:43,800
Why?

1804
02:25:44,260 --> 02:25:47,060
Why am I a streamer that likes to yapp?

1805
02:25:48,340 --> 02:25:52,480
I just actually locked the lock in.

1806
02:25:53,760 --> 02:25:56,660
The yapper diva.

1807
02:25:57,800 --> 02:25:59,760
Oh my god.

1808
02:26:02,800 --> 02:26:04,080
You stop yapping?

1809
02:26:04,580 --> 02:26:13,180
I'll stop supporting Gamma Deku with a secret chat Where do I go?

1810
02:26:13,940 --> 02:26:18,440
Oh, is that a- I can't even tell.

1811
02:26:18,520 --> 02:26:20,020
I didn't realize that was a platform.

1812
02:26:20,700 --> 02:26:28,840
I slowly and I slowly flow down I don't understand and I slowly I'm so tired

1813
02:26:33,760 --> 02:26:36,040
Thank God they put journalism mode.

1814
02:26:37,460 --> 02:26:38,500
Thank God.

1815
02:26:42,990 --> 02:26:44,270
Alright, here we go.

1816
02:26:45,930 --> 02:26:46,010
Oh.

1817
02:26:47,030 --> 02:26:49,490
Just to thank you for the five gift of ships.

1818
02:26:49,750 --> 02:26:50,350
Thank you, thank you.

1819
02:26:50,730 --> 02:26:53,190
Affiliate, I'm thinking for the five gift of ships.

1820
02:26:53,450 --> 02:26:54,010
Thank you, thank you.

1821
02:26:54,050 --> 02:26:55,690
Oh, now I play my music.

1822
02:27:00,370 --> 02:27:01,750
Today's not a dokey day.

1823
02:27:07,840 --> 02:27:10,000
I swear, it's literally...

1824
02:27:10,940 --> 02:27:14,620
I just can't comprehend random bullshit on my screen.

1825
02:27:17,360 --> 02:27:19,740
It's just too many balls.

1826
02:27:20,020 --> 02:27:20,840
I don't know.

1827
02:27:21,120 --> 02:27:22,020
It's too many.

1828
02:27:22,600 --> 02:27:27,220
There's like an appropriate amount of balls.

1829
02:27:27,360 --> 02:27:29,760
And those were not an appropriate amount of balls.

1830
02:27:30,160 --> 02:27:30,860
Those are far.

1831
02:27:30,920 --> 02:27:32,680
That was over the ocean limit.

1832
02:27:33,440 --> 02:27:37,080
The health inspector was not happy when he saw all those balls.

1833
02:27:47,100 --> 02:27:49,260
There's too many balls

1834
02:27:59,180 --> 02:28:05,880
It's really It's just the boulders That fight reminded me of the fucking boulders All over again

1835
02:28:09,820 --> 02:28:19,540
I felt like I was back in boulder town I was back for her light Eternal our song sustains

1836
02:28:31,610 --> 02:29:03,600
you don't understand birds are weak against rock and she was nearly using rock crash that's literally it gone gone gone gone gone but you're a bug a rock can crush a bug have you never fucking crushed up have you ever a rock at a bug?

1837
02:29:06,820 --> 02:29:09,000
You literally see a bug crying?

1838
02:29:09,180 --> 02:29:10,040
You drop the rock.

1839
02:29:10,240 --> 02:29:10,820
It's dead.

1840
02:29:13,060 --> 02:29:14,560
What the fuck do you mean?

1841
02:29:16,280 --> 02:29:19,100
Bugs are also weak against rock.

1842
02:29:22,780 --> 02:29:23,780
Where am I at?

1843
02:29:26,320 --> 02:29:29,340
No, don't see that to me.

1844
02:29:29,480 --> 02:29:32,980
Well, that's what happened to me for the last hour!

1845
02:29:36,840 --> 02:29:37,400
Where am I?

1846
02:29:37,400 --> 02:29:39,540
Oh my gosh, I forgot to put my compass back on.

1847
02:29:39,720 --> 02:29:40,900
I was like, where the fuck am I?

1848
02:29:40,900 --> 02:29:41,900
I'm so lost.

1849
02:29:42,500 --> 02:29:43,400
I'm so lost.

1850
02:29:43,560 --> 02:29:44,840
I'm tired and lost.

1851
02:29:46,400 --> 02:29:47,500
Oh my god.

1852
02:29:53,430 --> 02:29:54,390
This way.

1853
02:30:01,740 --> 02:30:03,860
Okay, things will be easier now.

1854
02:30:06,760 --> 02:30:09,780
As long as there's no more No more rocks.

1855
02:30:11,880 --> 02:30:13,520
It should be okay.

1856
02:30:14,160 --> 02:30:16,660
Okay, now everybody is freed now, right?

1857
02:30:18,880 --> 02:30:19,220
Hello.

1858
02:30:20,220 --> 02:30:20,480
Hello.

1859

Wary pilgrim.

1862
02:30:29,420 --> 02:30:35,920
This glorious bell heart may be past as fond as shine is still remains the last friendly stop before the citadel.

1863
02:30:36,880 --> 02:30:38,640
There's a task of I, very blessed.

1864
02:30:38,660 --> 02:30:41,960
Pavel to extend the warmest of welcome To those passing devout.

Your town Seems to have returned a healthy form, good bug.

1868
02:30:46,800 --> 02:30:50,380
As some concern that upon cutting You're free, I find only us.

1869
02:30:50,940 --> 02:30:55,380
Yes, well, many Most of our rest is to not fare So well.

1870
02:30:55,920 --> 02:30:58,320
So it's No good to dwell on dark things.

1871
02:30:58,640 --> 02:31:03,340
We shall build and grow and welcome As is any good spellbugs Task.

1872
02:31:04,060 --> 02:31:04,380
Okay.

1873
02:31:05,260 --> 02:31:06,560
So the town is back.

1874
02:31:08,660 --> 02:31:35,800
a nail upgrade i was promised nail upgrade oh wait no calm oh my god thank god thank god capitalism has yet to hit bell town thank god i'm so happy oh wait no it's because i bought this already never mind this is the one thing i unlocked i forgot it's been a while reading shopkeeper it seems you've recovered well from that silk and affliction Huh,

1875
02:31:36,160 --> 02:31:37,520
well, I'm a clever bug.

1876
02:31:37,900 --> 02:31:42,700
When that strange thread struck down from above, I shut up tight and huddled in my bell home.

1877
02:31:43,220 --> 02:31:48,980
Must've been a problem for the others about here, but my store was flush with supplies, so no fear I'll go hungry.

1878
02:31:49,760 --> 02:31:53,680
Your preparedness served you well, then, although your store now seems quite bare.

1879
02:31:54,740 --> 02:31:55,960
Yes, I admit.

1880
02:31:56,460 --> 02:31:59,760
Weight was longer than I anticipated, and a bug has to eat.

1881
02:32:00,560 --> 02:32:03,020
I have more to offer you once my courier turns up.

1882
02:32:03,020 --> 02:32:06,760
No doubt he's been avoiding Bellheart since the curse said it sights on us.

1883
02:32:07,620 --> 02:32:07,940
Alright.

1884
02:32:08,300 --> 02:32:10,700
I'm broke as fuck right now so I can't.

1885
02:32:10,720 --> 02:32:11,840
Wait, actually I have several.

1886
02:32:12,040 --> 02:32:12,520
You know what?

1887
02:32:12,520 --> 02:32:15,640
Yeah, I actually have several dockets, I'm pretty sure.

1888
02:32:16,540 --> 02:32:17,160
Oh yeah, I do.

1889
02:32:17,320 --> 02:32:17,980
What do I need?

1890
02:32:19,320 --> 02:32:20,940
Yeah, I gotta open this then.

1891
02:32:21,900 --> 02:32:23,140
Alright, I can buy memory.

1892
02:32:27,610 --> 02:32:27,990
Alright.

1893
02:32:30,270 --> 02:32:30,710
Uh.

1894
02:32:32,370 --> 02:32:33,190
What's this?

1895
02:32:33,650 --> 02:32:34,290
Which promise?

1896
02:32:34,490 --> 02:32:35,490
I did the wish.

1897
02:32:39,380 --> 02:32:40,960
When searching, you can sometimes find rare.

1898
02:32:41,020 --> 02:32:43,780
If you can salvage some, the material would be of great use.

1899
02:32:44,120 --> 02:32:45,780
Okay, I got a bunch of those.

1900
02:32:49,440 --> 02:32:51,220
My dear little Kouras was last seen.

1901
02:32:51,440 --> 02:32:54,820
Please someone find Tip and send him home, along with all the precious stock.

1902
02:32:56,260 --> 02:32:57,380
So he was at...

1903
02:32:58,000 --> 02:32:58,740
Where again?

1904
02:32:59,380 --> 02:33:01,680
I took the quest without actually reading it.

1905
02:33:03,540 --> 02:33:03,980
Alright.

1906
02:33:05,940 --> 02:33:06,500
something.

1907
02:33:07,380 --> 02:33:11,440
Do I want to keep using memory or I still want to use Reaper?

1908
02:33:12,920 --> 02:33:15,080
Do I want to try Wanderer more?

1909
02:33:15,400 --> 02:33:16,120
I don't know.

1910
02:33:19,240 --> 02:33:21,600
I'll do Wanderer and I'll unlock.

1911
02:33:23,320 --> 02:33:23,780
Eh.

1912
02:33:26,400 --> 02:33:28,360
I don't know which one I want to do.

1913
02:33:29,040 --> 02:33:30,900
Do I want to lock something in Wanderer?

1914
02:33:31,440 --> 02:33:31,880
Hmm.

1915
02:33:36,080 --> 02:33:37,660
I keep Reapering it.

1916
02:33:37,740 --> 02:33:39,020
I'll unlock it on Reaper then.

1917
02:33:42,960 --> 02:33:46,180
Alright, and then so I can finally put...

1918
02:33:46,180 --> 02:33:46,520
Ew.

1919
02:33:47,100 --> 02:33:48,220
It's up top.

1920
02:33:52,780 --> 02:33:53,600
This one?

1921
02:33:54,500 --> 02:33:56,380
Oh, that's not...

1922
02:33:56,380 --> 02:33:57,780
You don't seem like an upgrader.

1923
02:33:58,580 --> 02:33:59,260
Come on, what?

1924
02:33:59,560 --> 02:34:00,600
Who is it?

1925
02:34:00,720 --> 02:34:01,420
What you've got?

1926
02:34:01,660 --> 02:34:02,320
What do you want?

1927
02:34:02,760 --> 02:34:03,820
I am just a traveler.

1928
02:34:04,020 --> 02:34:08,380
One hoping you are not too badly affected by the curse snare set upon the sound.

1929
02:34:09,900 --> 02:34:10,180
Ha!

1930
02:34:10,180 --> 02:34:12,820
What binds them outside needs nothing to me.

1931
02:34:13,120 --> 02:34:16,640
None of them have my keen sense, my respect for the past.

1932
02:34:17,740 --> 02:34:19,320
You see, Mabel, though, sneaky too.

1933
02:34:19,740 --> 02:34:22,460
They find any final stuff, anything of a history to it.

1934
02:34:22,700 --> 02:34:23,280
Bring him here.

1935
02:34:23,440 --> 02:34:24,180
Oh, take it.

1936
02:34:24,420 --> 02:34:25,660
Oh, Mitch, take it for the raid.

1937
02:34:25,760 --> 02:34:26,560
Thank you, thank you.

1938
02:34:27,300 --> 02:34:28,020
But what's this?

1939
02:34:28,240 --> 02:34:29,680
I smell something on you right now.

1940
02:34:29,920 --> 02:34:31,200
You have a relic for me?

1941
02:34:32,060 --> 02:34:32,620
Yeah, sure.

1942
02:34:32,860 --> 02:34:33,420
Take it.

1943
02:34:34,560 --> 02:34:36,420
Yes, this is my collection.

1944
02:34:36,540 --> 02:34:37,580
Well, look at them.

1945
02:34:37,820 --> 02:34:38,840
Look at what I have.

1946
02:34:39,480 --> 02:34:40,060
What do you have?

1947
02:34:41,240 --> 02:34:42,520
Oh, nice, money.

1948
02:34:43,700 --> 02:34:46,960
Vaded parchment contained the last words of a lost pilgrim.

1949
02:34:47,200 --> 02:34:47,360
Eh.

1950
02:34:47,920 --> 02:34:50,080
Morning, bring me more relics of the past.

1951
02:34:50,320 --> 02:34:51,240
Record seals, idols.

1952
02:34:51,560 --> 02:34:53,840
Let's gather up the history of the world and hoard it all year.

1953
02:34:54,200 --> 02:34:55,220
Nice and safe.

1954
02:34:56,420 --> 02:35:00,340
If I have been upon more curiosities of this kingdom past, I may visit again.

1955
02:35:00,720 --> 02:35:02,660
Until that time, keep yourself safe.

1956
02:35:03,120 --> 02:35:03,520
Whoa!

1957
02:35:05,440 --> 02:35:05,920
Whoa!

1958
02:35:08,680 --> 02:35:10,160
Hey, Doki, don't upgrade.

1959
02:35:10,180 --> 02:35:11,300
No, I'm fuck off.

1960
02:35:11,560 --> 02:35:13,040
I'm upgrading now.

1961
02:35:13,340 --> 02:35:14,720
Mr. Broken Fond.

1962
02:35:14,760 --> 02:35:16,000
He's in a super chat.

1963
02:35:16,260 --> 02:35:17,280
Bro, I got...

1964
02:35:17,280 --> 02:35:17,760
Whoa!

1965
02:35:18,400 --> 02:35:21,020
Horton, I did not know you were like that.

1966
02:35:21,420 --> 02:35:22,040
Oh, my God.

1967
02:35:22,060 --> 02:35:24,140
I didn't know you came from the Xbox era.

1968
02:35:28,060 --> 02:35:30,560
It's my calling to gather the relics of the past.

1969
02:35:30,840 --> 02:35:31,640
Horton, no!

1970
02:35:31,980 --> 02:35:33,160
Look at my collection.

1971
02:35:33,560 --> 02:35:35,360
If you fancy, look, look.

1972
02:35:35,960 --> 02:35:37,160
Oh, I just want to have...

1973
02:35:37,160 --> 02:35:38,220
I just have one relic.

1974
02:35:39,340 --> 02:35:40,020
Unluck you.

1975
02:35:41,060 --> 02:35:42,800
Or it's a true gamer.

1976
02:35:42,900 --> 02:35:44,260
Oh, this has to be him, right?

1977
02:35:45,700 --> 02:35:46,240
By God.

1978
02:35:46,600 --> 02:35:47,980
Are you then our savior in the shell?

1979
02:35:48,640 --> 02:35:52,540
Standing so calm and cool on entries to Pliny's bell home?

1980
02:35:53,780 --> 02:35:54,540
What clues, sir?

1981
02:35:54,700 --> 02:35:55,100
Tell me.

1982
02:35:55,420 --> 02:35:57,900
Tell us on my part in your town liberation.

1983
02:35:58,640 --> 02:36:01,060
Why your beard, blade, pierced.

1984
02:36:01,740 --> 02:36:03,720
Why your blade, pierced warrior.

1985
02:36:04,140 --> 02:36:08,840
Any fine pin master will detect the sign of a deadly work upon that needle's edge.

1986
02:36:10,180 --> 02:36:11,660
I'll curse that struct here.

1987
02:36:12,200 --> 02:36:16,000
No simple bug, nor basic pin, could have granted our release.

1988
02:36:16,440 --> 02:36:16,640
No.

1989
02:36:17,260 --> 02:36:20,640
That blade, though, so expertly clutched in claw.

1990
02:36:21,280 --> 02:36:23,540
That could well have met the task.

1991
02:36:23,860 --> 02:36:25,380
It was you who cut us free, yes?

1992
02:36:25,800 --> 02:36:26,240
Winera.

1993
02:36:28,920 --> 02:36:33,420
I've granted you a sharp sight, Pin Master, and your savings is, fortuitous.

1994
02:36:33,660 --> 02:36:36,760
This blade that restored your town will now benefit from your service.

1995
02:36:37,300 --> 02:36:38,360
Well, yes.

1996
02:36:40,180 --> 02:36:50,040
pins to 10 but your gracious heroism decrees that unique weapon receives my care at this very moment what say i take a look yes please

1997
02:36:53,340 --> 02:37:08,420
thank god bosses now have control i don't care the bosses have quintuple health or does four times damage i am not doing this again i am not repeating my history

1998
02:37:11,840 --> 02:38:09,180
by my expert club your strange blade has received some fast sharp shine it shall cut cleaner than ever before your efforts provide great aid penmaster you have my thanks all right do i have more or is that one uh can the blade be honed further you seek further sharpening further than pilney does provide impertinence but maybe but no you're you hesitate then it is possible are you others within the kingdom oh i'm saying are you skilled if wait yes seek knock others but an oil fabled and fine with it the citadel once brought climbing edge and point to its pins though the citadel's pin masters are long past some small store of that miraculous elixir may return within this hall or even a mere mere drop pilfered and gifted upon plenty your blade could shine brighter still.

1999
02:38:09,800 --> 02:38:15,720
Just know, dear friend, the veiled bugs would be oh so unkind to the thief who claimed that fine prize for themselves.

2000
02:38:21,320 --> 02:38:23,720
I believe I could go down the street to get one cheaper.

2001
02:38:24,840 --> 02:38:26,260
He's like, wait, stop!

2002
02:38:26,640 --> 02:38:27,960
We match every price.

2003
02:38:28,720 --> 02:38:30,260
I will find the oil, pin master.

2004
02:38:31,380 --> 02:38:34,020
My needle has seen much use in this cruel kingdom.

2005
02:38:34,520 --> 02:38:36,220
I suspect many more battles are due.

2006
02:38:36,740 --> 02:38:38,960
I will value your further skills upon my blade.

2007
02:38:39,680 --> 02:39:01,180
it is dangerous wish you accept of this poor pin master i really hope this one's professional desire does not cost you your life perhaps oh oops sorry okay i just wanted to make sure if i if i had all the um everything is that it it should be it right

All right, left the shower.

2010
02:39:54,450 --> 02:39:55,610
I waited.

2011
02:39:57,470 --> 02:40:01,330
I was just so sad about that chair, so I waited.

2012
02:40:02,270 --> 02:40:05,630
How do I get there?

2013
02:40:05,750 --> 02:40:06,590
Okay, we just go there.

2014
02:40:13,460 --> 02:40:14,560
Let's go this way.

2015
02:40:17,280 --> 02:40:17,940
I'm sad.

2016
02:40:18,900 --> 02:40:19,540
Oh.

2017
02:40:23,640 --> 02:40:32,340
trap what what is over here oh makes me so confident when i don't have a map for this

2018
02:40:36,460 --> 02:40:41,200
now up when can i go up

2019
02:40:46,510 --> 02:40:53,350
hello the sand marks the edge of fireloom's territory i was brought to this land through the caverns beyond.

2020
02:40:54,190 --> 02:40:56,610
Something of this kingdom's height still hungers for me.

2021
02:40:56,950 --> 02:40:58,110
We're at Tafinio now.

2022
02:40:58,770 --> 02:41:02,350
Until I find the source of that hunger and steal it, I will not be free.

2023
02:41:02,590 --> 02:41:04,990
Oh, there's an invisible wall down there.

2024
02:41:06,410 --> 02:41:07,530
Imagine if I just leave.

2025
02:41:08,090 --> 02:41:10,770
I'm just like, alright, my job here is done.

2026
02:41:13,730 --> 02:41:15,290
Where that gap was?

2027
02:41:16,570 --> 02:41:17,030
Yeah?

2028
02:41:17,210 --> 02:41:18,170
Oh, here.

2029
02:41:21,630 --> 02:41:23,670
Except the of the rise beyond.

2030
02:41:24,190 --> 02:41:28,010
The all who stand at Farnoom's holy crest prove pure will and want.

2031
02:41:30,670 --> 02:41:30,930
Oh.

2032
02:41:31,390 --> 02:41:33,490
I thought that's where I played a music.

2033
02:41:39,220 --> 02:41:39,840
Up I go.

2034
02:41:40,880 --> 02:41:41,960
Oh, I'm doing the pilgrimage.

2035
02:41:42,320 --> 02:41:42,980
What's this?

2036
02:41:44,300 --> 02:41:45,340
That's the chair, right?

2037
02:41:47,700 --> 02:41:49,700
God pay the hobo tax.

2038
02:41:53,180 --> 02:41:53,780
Yay!

2039
02:42:01,490 --> 02:42:14,550

2041
02:42:30,050 --> 02:42:31,930
What the fuck?

2042
02:42:33,570 --> 02:42:33,650
What the fuck?

2043
02:42:33,650 --> 02:42:34,870
Oh shit, I want to do this.

2044
02:42:35,990 --> 02:42:37,430
Holy shit!

2045
02:42:38,350 --> 02:42:39,270
They're robots!

2046
02:42:43,310 --> 02:42:45,410
What the fuck was that?

2047
02:42:48,270 --> 02:42:49,910
Oh, yeah, now go.

2048
02:42:51,250 --> 02:42:52,130
Where does this go?

2049
02:42:53,090 --> 02:42:53,830
Oh shit!

2050
02:42:55,470 --> 02:42:56,590
Alright, nice.

2051
02:42:58,170 --> 02:43:00,730
Oh, it's just shells.

2052
02:43:01,650 --> 02:43:02,470
I get...

2053
02:43:02,470 --> 02:43:04,310
Oh, and I lost all of it.

2054
02:43:07,350 --> 02:43:08,310
Good shells.

2055
02:43:09,830 --> 02:43:10,650
Good investment.

2056
02:43:17,710 --> 02:43:18,450
Okay, up I go.

2057
02:43:19,930 --> 02:43:20,590
There's something here.

2058
02:43:20,650 --> 02:43:22,790
Oh, I don't have double jump so I can't go there.

2059
02:43:28,560 --> 02:43:29,420
Yeah, money!

2060
02:43:31,920 --> 02:43:33,200
What the fuck?

2061
02:43:34,240 --> 02:43:35,360
Get over here.

2062
02:43:36,520 --> 02:43:39,720
Oh, they're also trying to do the pilgrimage, and I'm stopping it.

2063
02:43:41,060 --> 02:43:47,600
They're like, please, I'm just trying to go to that pilgrimage with my religion.

2064
02:43:47,860 --> 02:43:51,820
I'm like, don't worry, I'll take you to your god early.

2065
02:43:57,740 --> 02:44:02,220
They're just trying to do, go to the holy land.

2066
02:44:04,020 --> 02:44:05,000
Don't worry.

2067
02:44:06,340 --> 02:44:08,820
I'm here to help you.

2068
02:44:08,840 --> 02:44:09,620
What's that?

2069
02:44:12,060 --> 02:44:13,780
Oh, he just jumped to his death.

2070
02:44:21,560 --> 02:44:22,440
Oh, dying.

2071
02:44:24,720 --> 02:44:24,800
Oh no.

2072
02:44:30,050 --> 02:44:30,770
Dying.

2073
02:44:31,130 --> 02:44:33,210
I hate this guy so much.

2074
02:44:36,010 --> 02:44:37,650
What the fuck?

2075
02:44:43,390 --> 02:44:43,790
That's fine.

2076
02:44:44,870 --> 02:44:45,890
Wait, that's not fine.

2077
02:44:46,650 --> 02:44:48,550
Wait, I didn't realize how low HP I was.

2078
02:44:49,410 --> 02:44:50,730
I was like, it's fine.

2079
02:44:58,520 --> 02:44:59,320
Alright, this way.

2080
02:45:00,680 --> 02:45:02,340
Gong, gong, gong.

2081
02:45:03,320 --> 02:45:04,600
Oh, wait, who are you?

2082
02:45:07,380 --> 02:45:08,480
What the fuck?

2083
02:45:09,980 --> 02:45:12,320
Oh my god, he has this old little gun.

2084
02:45:15,620 --> 02:45:16,860
Oh, she's here!

2085
02:45:27,220 --> 02:45:28,980
I think I'm bro.

2086
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:31,080
Hoshanka child.

2087
02:45:31,540 --> 02:45:31,720
Shakira!

2088
02:45:32,920 --> 02:45:33,740
Child wielding needle.

2089
02:45:34,340 --> 02:45:36,340
Have you seen Trace summon master in your vibe?

2090
02:45:36,940 --> 02:45:38,640
I feel she was only here recently.

2091
02:45:39,620 --> 02:45:41,360
I cannot say for certain, Shakira.

2092
02:45:41,960 --> 02:45:46,920
Though she travels seeking silk-yield opponents, these steps will serve her well.

2093
02:45:48,600 --> 02:46:15,830
them are formidable true impressive guardians they are fighting defensively and love to leave their station they swing their weapons with a cool retaliate that should not be underestimated oh I do have enough yeah I'm gonna survive the recession guys guys I'm

2094
02:46:21,610 --> 02:46:25,610
just gonna use that I don't I don't really care about wasting my managing.

2095
02:46:33,170 --> 02:46:35,590
Can I imagine if I could just...

2096
02:46:35,590 --> 02:46:36,230
Oh shit!

2097
02:46:42,790 --> 02:46:43,290
Okay.

2098
02:46:45,090 --> 02:46:46,850
Jesus Christ, this guy is annoying!

2099
02:46:49,490 --> 02:46:51,990
Nice, I was gonna try and hit him off the platform.

2100
02:46:56,990 --> 02:47:24,860
all right that's right you ain't going to the holy land i will be the only one that makes this pilgrimage there's gonna only be one one survivor here oh fuck it that would have been sad if i got hit by that oh my God, your magic is so far away from me.

2101
02:47:25,930 --> 02:47:26,630
Oh, fuck.

2102
02:47:30,860 --> 02:47:32,620
I'll send you to God.

2103
02:47:36,360 --> 02:47:40,340
I don't know, I'll just, like, Pogo here.

2104
02:47:42,100 --> 02:47:43,360
There you go.

2105
02:47:43,940 --> 02:47:44,240
Ow!

2106
02:47:46,160 --> 02:47:47,580
Not cool, buddy!

2107
02:47:51,120 --> 02:47:51,780
What?

2108
02:47:51,780 --> 02:47:52,020
What?

2109
02:47:54,360 --> 02:47:56,220
How did that hit me?

2110
02:47:58,020 --> 02:47:58,580
Oh!

2111
02:47:58,840 --> 02:47:59,420
Okay, it's fine.

2112
02:47:59,580 --> 02:48:00,120
I'm still alive.

2113
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:02,400
Oh, nice!

2114
02:48:02,580 --> 02:48:03,740
Oh, it blows me further!

2115
02:48:04,760 --> 02:48:05,140
Yay!

2116
02:48:07,620 --> 02:48:12,940
I assume I'm not supposed to... Yeah, now that would like hinder me if I do that.

2117
02:48:14,400 --> 02:48:16,480
Okay, I made it.

2118
02:48:22,570 --> 02:48:23,890
What happens now?

2119
02:48:25,870 --> 02:48:26,750
Oh, okay.

2120
02:48:27,010 --> 02:48:28,330
I guess that unlocks the shortcut?

2121
02:48:37,920 --> 02:48:39,120
Oh, whoops.

2122
02:48:41,160 --> 02:48:44,660
Wait, I need you to die closer to me so I can rob you after I kill you.

2123
02:48:45,560 --> 02:48:47,780
After I roared your journey.

2124
02:48:49,420 --> 02:48:50,040
There you go.

2125
02:48:53,020 --> 02:48:54,320
God, the snakes are so scared.

2126
02:48:55,420 --> 02:48:58,060
They're like, it's dinner time.

2127
02:48:58,420 --> 02:48:58,760
Oh!

2128
02:49:06,400 --> 02:49:07,000
Yeah.

2129
02:49:11,380 --> 02:49:13,280
All right, I have to make sure where to go.

2130
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:16,520
All right, just like that.

2131
02:49:16,880 --> 02:49:17,700
All right, I made it.

2132
02:49:18,040 --> 02:49:18,720
Now where did I go?

2133
02:49:18,800 --> 02:49:19,540
Left or right?

2134
02:49:19,620 --> 02:49:20,320
I'm going to go left.

2135
02:49:20,920 --> 02:49:21,740
Oh, left is trap.

2136
02:49:22,020 --> 02:49:22,740
Yeah, that's good.

2137
02:49:23,740 --> 02:49:24,520
I just think I have money.

2138
02:49:25,100 --> 02:49:25,560
Yeah, I do.

2139
02:49:27,520 --> 02:49:29,000
The sand hungers.

2140
02:49:31,580 --> 02:49:33,300
Be one with the sand.

2141
02:49:34,100 --> 02:49:34,940
Be one with us.

2142
02:49:37,600 --> 02:49:40,240
Come on, you know you want to be one with the worms.

2143
02:49:41,380 --> 02:49:43,300
And then I gotta pay again.

2144
02:49:44,340 --> 02:49:44,920
Oh.

2145
02:49:45,480 --> 02:49:47,060
What happened to the city?

2146
02:49:47,600 --> 02:49:48,700
What happened?

2147
02:49:51,600 --> 02:49:52,840
I know what.

2148
02:49:52,880 --> 02:49:55,080
And this is the nerfed version.

2149
02:49:58,500 --> 02:50:01,040
This is why the market crashed.

2150
02:50:01,680 --> 02:50:02,800
This right here.

2151
02:50:04,280 --> 02:50:05,480
The economy.

2152
02:50:06,780 --> 02:50:08,820
Inflation is so real.

2153
02:50:09,760 --> 02:50:11,360
This is why the market crashed.

2154
02:50:11,380 --> 02:50:13,140
market crashed in bug land.

2155
02:50:15,840 --> 02:50:16,020
What?

2156
02:50:18,280 --> 02:50:20,460
I can't even get up there.

2157
02:50:20,920 --> 02:50:21,400
He's like, hello!

2158
02:50:30,660 --> 02:50:32,440
I don't even know where I'm going.

2159
02:50:36,640 --> 02:50:37,540
Oh, it's a flee.

2160
02:50:37,780 --> 02:50:39,180
I was like, this has to be a flee.

2161
02:50:41,060 --> 02:50:41,240
Goodbye.

2162
02:50:47,150 --> 02:50:47,630
Alright.

2163
02:50:48,870 --> 02:50:49,690
Go this way.

2164
02:50:51,050 --> 02:50:54,850
I need to make sure I don't fucking fall to my death down there.

2165
02:50:54,930 --> 02:50:56,450
Wait, what is over there?

2166
02:50:59,150 --> 02:51:01,170
Alright, we go right now.

2167
02:51:12,060 --> 02:51:12,860
What's this?

2168
02:51:15,180 --> 02:51:16,160
Oh no.

2169
02:51:16,600 --> 02:51:17,720
Oh no, the sand.

2170
02:51:18,300 --> 02:51:19,020
What?

2171
02:51:20,560 --> 02:51:22,480
The sand's still hungers.

2172
02:51:24,620 --> 02:51:26,780
It's still hungers.

2173
02:51:29,120 --> 02:51:34,340
Oh my god, it's calling for me It's calling for my name.

2174
02:51:37,540 --> 02:51:39,060
Okay, I did not expect the dash.

2175
02:51:41,180 --> 02:51:41,540
When?

2176
02:51:47,860 --> 02:51:51,940
Okay, where do I go?

2177
02:51:54,340 --> 02:51:55,540
Not here.

2178
02:51:56,500 --> 02:51:57,640
So I didn't have to fly.

2179
02:51:58,280 --> 02:51:58,760
Wee!

2180
02:52:00,060 --> 02:52:01,040
Now what?

2181
02:52:01,540 --> 02:52:02,740
I guess this way?

2182
02:52:07,040 --> 02:52:08,360
It hungers.

2183
02:52:09,880 --> 02:52:10,260
Okay.

2184
02:52:10,260 --> 02:52:14,580
Can I kill him?

2185
02:52:15,180 --> 02:52:15,740
Oh my god!

2186
02:52:15,960 --> 02:52:16,240
Oh my god.

2187
02:52:17,700 --> 02:52:18,920
That robot was depressed.

2188
02:52:20,940 --> 02:52:21,760
It was Gemini.

2189
02:52:22,480 --> 02:52:26,060
That was a Gemini robot right there.

2190
02:52:26,640 --> 02:52:28,020
Somebody fed him some code.

2191
02:52:28,380 --> 02:52:29,120
And it was over.

2192
02:52:31,540 --> 02:52:34,220
Wait, why is that over there?

2193
02:52:36,840 --> 02:52:38,880
Someone fed that poor robot some code.

2194
02:52:50,920 --> 02:52:51,620
That's a shortcut?

2195
02:52:51,920 --> 02:52:52,960
That did not tell short.

2196
02:52:53,760 --> 02:52:54,540
Wait, what?

2197
02:52:54,860 --> 02:52:56,260
Oh, it was just...

2198
02:52:56,260 --> 02:52:57,400
It was already dead.

2199
02:53:00,680 --> 02:53:01,640
Oh, fuck.

2200
02:53:02,340 --> 02:53:03,780
I was a little confused with that.

2201
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:08,840
Do I have to?

2202
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:10,580
Oh, that was a shortcut.

2203
02:53:13,200 --> 02:53:15,200
I didn't realize I should have gone down from there.

2204
02:53:17,500 --> 02:53:18,420
Wait, what's over there?

2205
02:53:18,700 --> 02:53:19,640
Wait, you guys saw that?

2206
02:53:23,320 --> 02:53:24,460
What's over here?

2207
02:53:25,840 --> 02:53:26,320
Secret?

2208
02:53:31,310 --> 02:53:33,210
Oh, nothing important right now.

2209
02:53:38,780 --> 02:53:39,300
Hello!

2210
02:53:42,160 --> 02:53:43,340
What's over here?

2211
02:53:44,480 --> 02:54:18,480
The gate, the gate, oh the grand gate, the citadel stands before us we are so close oh mighty one beyond the gate we beg you open the way and let we port insignificant little pilgrims crawl into the light i see no gatekeepers to heed your plea pilgrim though i too seek entry to the citadel have you heard of a means to open this gateway oh weapons blunt it not no holes for keys there's the bells they say the holy bells that opened the way.

2212
02:54:19,140 --> 02:54:22,840
On my journey up, I passed many large bells housed in old shrines.

2213
02:54:23,520 --> 02:54:26,420
I was struck awake, yet still this gate stayed close.

2214
02:54:26,860 --> 02:54:29,940
What are tasks must be done to see us passed beyond?

2215
02:54:30,880 --> 02:54:38,040
The bells are run, then the sacred threshold may now be crossed, but the final task is simple.

2216
02:54:38,460 --> 02:54:40,660
Only music played fair and true.

2217
02:54:41,160 --> 02:54:44,840
Music's how it tuned the bells and seeing a gate descend.

2218
02:54:45,760 --> 02:54:55,540
It must be you to lead us sister you who brought us this blessing players sing and we shall follow okay i can do that

2219
02:55:02,240 --> 02:55:12,320
thank you i just learned it an hour ago oh is that also supposed to happen pilgrims

2220
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:18,220
It was their idea!

2221
02:55:18,480 --> 02:55:18,900
Yes!

2222
02:55:19,260 --> 02:55:20,060
Okay, thank God.

2223
02:55:22,260 --> 02:55:24,600
It was their idea!

2224
02:55:24,960 --> 02:55:25,800
I swear to God!

2225
02:55:28,100 --> 02:55:30,100
Not my father!

2226
02:55:32,120 --> 02:55:33,180
Three, four!

2227
02:55:36,380 --> 02:55:38,560

02:55:39,460 --> 02:55:40,880

No harm can come to us on this holy ascent.

2238
02:57:10,350 --> 02:57:12,310
We only need to keep our gaze upwards.

2239
02:57:13,050 --> 02:57:15,010
This is all so terribly grand.

2240
02:57:15,490 --> 02:57:19,270
The great stone steps, the winds lifting us like the voices of a choir.

2241
02:57:19,730 --> 02:57:22,550
And just beyond it all, does our pilgrimage's end.

2242
02:57:22,870 --> 02:57:24,750
The great citadel at last.

2243
02:57:25,750 --> 02:57:26,610
Sing for me.

2244
02:57:27,390 --> 02:57:30,370
Oh, the shadow bench has risen for us.

2245
02:57:30,750 --> 02:57:33,090
Barlooms kind as to we- I paid for this!

2246

2248
02:58:37,890 --> 02:58:40,590
Guess we'll never know the end of that song.

2249
02:58:41,710 --> 02:58:43,990
Don't ruin this chat.

2250
02:58:44,490 --> 02:58:45,110
Like, funny.

2251
02:58:46,130 --> 02:58:49,770
We'll never know how that song ends.

2252
02:58:51,150 --> 02:58:53,010
Alright, we gotta swap this.

2253
02:58:53,150 --> 02:58:54,410
I guess we swapped this.

2254
02:58:57,350 --> 02:58:58,990
And then...

2255
02:59:00,740 --> 02:59:02,160
That's it.

2256
02:59:10,360 --> 02:59:14,140
A lot of people said it was a shortcut.

2257
02:59:15,920 --> 02:59:17,280
People lie.

2258
02:59:17,740 --> 02:59:18,760
Oh, fuck this.

2259
02:59:18,980 --> 02:59:20,060
I cannot be bothered.

2260
02:59:24,220 --> 02:59:25,940
Is it this?

2261
02:59:26,540 --> 02:59:30,260
How the fuck is the shortcut that I was lied to about?

2262
02:59:30,960 --> 02:59:30,960
Are

2263
02:59:36,070 --> 02:59:42,050
you serious?

2264
02:59:42,110 --> 02:59:43,030
Get out of here.

2265
02:59:44,950 --> 02:59:46,690
Like, how do I do this shortcut?

2266
02:59:52,440 --> 02:59:54,660
Oh, it's from here.

2267
02:59:55,260 --> 02:59:56,400
Okay, I get it.

2268
02:59:57,480 --> 02:59:58,340
I get it.

2269
02:59:58,520 --> 03:00:00,020
I passed the shortcut already.

2270
03:00:00,180 --> 03:00:01,280
Oh, wait, the guy died.

2271
03:00:01,460 --> 03:00:02,140
That's good.

2272
03:00:02,680 --> 03:00:05,040
While I was trying to figure out the shortcut, he died.

2273
03:00:09,740 --> 03:00:11,920
Oh, no, not the worms.

2274
03:00:20,580 --> 03:00:22,660
Okay, that's the guy that can't talk.

2275
03:00:25,500 --> 03:00:26,160
Whee!

2276
03:00:27,680 --> 03:00:29,220
Okay, so like...

2277
03:00:30,160 --> 03:00:37,280
So like, it's a little bad that I already sort of messed it up.

2278
03:00:37,720 --> 03:00:38,200
Okay.

2279
03:00:38,420 --> 03:00:40,820
You think he got me?

2280
03:00:40,940 --> 03:00:41,500
Yeah, he did.

2281
03:00:43,560 --> 03:00:44,220
Okay,

2282
03:00:48,180 --> 03:00:50,300
I'm worried about the throwing thing.

2283
03:00:51,740 --> 03:00:53,160
Yeah, this one.

2284
03:00:56,740 --> 03:00:59,080
Yeah, this one I'm worried about.

2285
03:01:02,020 --> 03:01:03,460
Because I don't know when he used...

2286
03:01:12,570 --> 03:01:12,870
Jump!

2287
03:01:13,630 --> 03:01:14,090
Thank God.

2288
03:01:14,430 --> 03:01:15,430
I need all that magic.

2289
03:01:19,050 --> 03:01:20,150
Oh, no, not fire!

2290
03:01:22,970 --> 03:01:23,450
Play!

2291
03:01:24,150 --> 03:01:24,990
Oh, my God.

2292
03:01:25,090 --> 03:01:26,210
I don't know what to do.

2293
03:01:26,930 --> 03:01:26,970
Ah!

2294
03:01:41,600 --> 03:01:44,500
I slowly floated into her face.

2295
03:01:47,260 --> 03:01:47,780
Alright.

2296
03:01:49,400 --> 03:01:54,080
Okay, so I'm sort of figuring it out, but also not ready, really.

2297
03:01:58,240 --> 03:02:01,180
I mean, I think I hate that bug the most.

2298
03:02:07,940 --> 03:02:10,420
Okay, oh my god, I went the wrong way again.

2299
03:02:13,280 --> 03:02:29,820
I made the same mistake Because I got confused And then I forgot about the shortcut again I mean the runback It's not so bad

2300
03:02:34,640 --> 03:02:42,840
Unless this is like the nerf version of it This runback is not Yeah it's oh it's nerfed Okay yeah I was gonna say this is not so bad

2301
03:02:53,600 --> 03:02:58,240

2302
03:03:02,220 --> 03:03:03,500

2313
03:04:53,730 --> 03:04:55,010
That's not his job.

2314
03:04:55,150 --> 03:04:57,210
He's literally doing this because he doesn't have a job.

2315
03:05:16,800 --> 03:05:18,800
Alright, I know that that's the fling.

2316
03:05:19,920 --> 03:05:20,360

03:05:21,060 --> 03:05:21,360

Oh my god, not the fire.

A fire is scary.

03:05:26,780 --> 03:05:27,840
Fire is scary.

2321
03:05:28,880 --> 03:05:29,160

03:05:30,660 --> 03:05:32,180
Okay, that was an accident.

2336
03:06:02,020 --> 03:06:03,920

All right, next time I'll use the shortcut, guys.

2345
03:06:54,340 --> 03:06:55,660
And then she never does.

2346
03:06:59,740 --> 03:07:02,220
And then she never uses it.

2347
03:07:07,150 --> 03:07:07,990
When?

2348
03:07:09,490 --> 03:07:09,850

He's such a bitch.

2359
03:07:50,010 --> 03:07:52,990
I can't even make sure I'm a sing for me.

2360
03:07:57,510 --> 03:07:58,350
Point and not.

2361
03:07:58,430 --> 03:07:59,550
So how do I do it?

2362
03:08:00,090 --> 03:08:02,250
How do I do the shortcut, guys?

2363
03:08:13,130 --> 03:08:14,890
I keep, I don't know.

2364
03:08:16,150 --> 03:08:17,970
Oh, the boys.

2365
03:08:19,910 --> 03:08:20,590
Where's the short?

03:08:20,630 --> 03:08:21,490
Oh, there it is.

2367
03:08:22,190 --> 03:08:23,030

03:08:28,630 --> 03:08:30,210
Now I know where the shortcut is.

2371
03:08:30,290 --> 03:08:30,710
It's over.

2372
03:08:38,930 --> 03:08:39,410
Alright.

2373
03:08:40,350 --> 03:08:43,230
I just get to phase two and then she starts throwing fire.

2374
03:08:44,190 --> 03:08:46,030
And then I was like, fire bad?

2375

Fire so bad.

2402
03:11:15,040 --> 03:11:19,980
These bosses, I did not realize how much worse they could get.

2403
03:11:26,000 --> 03:11:27,760
Fire bad.

2404
03:11:34,440 --> 03:11:34,940
Oh, whoops.

2405
03:11:35,580 --> 03:11:36,540
I got greed there.

2406
03:11:39,740 --> 03:11:40,300
Weeeeee!

2407
03:11:42,320 --> 03:11:45,640
Everything changed when the fire judge the attack.

2408
03:11:46,220 --> 03:11:47,760
Yeah, I already upgraded my nail.

2409
03:11:48,180 --> 03:11:49,180
I got plus one.

2410
03:11:52,100 --> 03:11:53,980
I just let that happen.

2411
03:11:54,420 --> 03:11:56,740
I was just like, fuck.

2412
03:11:57,360 --> 03:12:04,400
I think like, I will save.

2413
03:12:05,800 --> 03:12:09,480
Silk Sun, you have to be more aggressive.

2414
03:12:10,440 --> 03:12:10,960
For sure.

2433
03:14:16,680 --> 03:14:17,200
Oh no.

2434
03:14:17,200 --> 03:14:18,680
No, not the fire.

2435
03:14:20,880 --> 03:14:22,940
I'm trying not to get cornered.

2436
03:14:24,720 --> 03:14:25,220
Are you sick?

2437
03:14:25,600 --> 03:14:26,100

I got column mode so hard.

03:15:00,660 --> 03:15:04,420
Okay, I might have wasted my shit there.

03:15:04,420 --> 03:15:05,720
That's okay.

2451
03:15:09,500 --> 03:15:10,540
That's okay.

2452
03:15:11,180 --> 03:15:13,060
It's all about sending a message.

2453
03:15:19,340 --> 03:15:22,020
Not trying to get cornered but runs into that corner.

2454
03:15:22,320 --> 03:15:23,420
I can't help it!

2455
03:15:23,660 --> 03:15:24,840
The corner!

2456
03:15:25,500 --> 03:15:26,700
It speaks to me!

2457
03:15:27,800 --> 03:15:29,000
Do not hear it?

2458
03:15:29,440 --> 03:15:30,940
It calls my name.

2459
03:15:32,020 --> 03:15:32,700
I'm...

2460
03:15:38,410 --> 03:15:40,210
It's calling for me.

2461
03:15:41,730 --> 03:15:43,510
I'm gonna use it now.

2462
03:15:48,840 --> 03:15:49,580
Just in case.

2463
03:15:50,200 --> 03:15:52,260
Oh, now he does the jumpies.

2464
03:15:53,120 --> 03:15:53,780
What?

2465
03:15:57,580 --> 03:15:59,000
Oh my god.

2466
03:15:59,460 --> 03:16:00,740
I'm gonna hit by everything.

2467
03:16:01,440 --> 03:16:02,540
Fuck you.

2468
03:16:04,940 --> 03:16:06,460
Fuck you.

2469
03:16:11,140 --> 03:16:12,860
Oh shit, fuck me.

2470
03:16:16,280 --> 03:16:18,080
Every single time.

2471
03:16:23,780 --> 03:16:24,220
Alright.

2472
03:16:26,580 --> 03:16:27,780
I couldn't heal.

2473
03:16:30,340 --> 03:16:31,220
I lived...

2474
03:16:31,220 --> 03:16:32,480
Oh my god, that shit was scary.

2475
03:16:32,620 --> 03:16:35,120
I almost got into that worm pit, I thought.

2476
03:16:37,400 --> 03:16:40,640
And what I'm not surprised by, the times 2 times 3 damage.

2477
03:16:41,920 --> 03:16:42,720
That's what I'm saying.

2478
03:16:42,800 --> 03:16:45,980
Just give me 3 masks if they're all just going to do times 2 damage anyway.

2479
03:16:46,440 --> 03:16:51,520
If you give me 3 masks and then make it so that If they all do one damage, then it's just the same thing.

2480
03:16:51,920 --> 03:16:53,920
Why give me this false sense of security?

2481
03:17:09,390 --> 03:17:11,170
Oh my god, that's my bad.

2482
03:17:11,530 --> 03:17:12,210
I fucked up that.

2483
03:17:12,890 --> 03:17:13,990
Oh my god, I'm in the corner.

2484
03:17:14,890 --> 03:17:15,590
Arrest it!

2485
03:17:16,390 --> 03:17:18,750
I will not be in the corner again.

2486
03:17:19,310 --> 03:17:21,250
Proceeds to put myself in the corner.

2487
03:17:28,020 --> 03:17:28,900
Okay, nice.

2488
03:17:31,700 --> 03:17:33,260
Okay, that was an accident.

2489
03:17:34,840 --> 03:17:36,320
I'm in the corner again.

2490
03:17:36,940 --> 03:17:37,860
I'm never there.

2491
03:17:38,940 --> 03:17:41,060
I'm never there in a fair league.

2492
03:17:47,050 --> 03:17:47,950
Oh my god, please.

2493
03:17:48,450 --> 03:17:49,110
Get me out of here.

2494
03:17:49,610 --> 03:17:50,430
Get me out of the corner.

2495
03:17:50,770 --> 03:17:51,030
Please.

2496
03:17:51,350 --> 03:17:51,610
Please.

2497
03:17:51,970 --> 03:17:52,730
Get me out of the corner.

2498
03:17:53,290 --> 03:17:53,950
Let me leave.

2499
03:17:54,330 --> 03:17:55,110
Thank god.

2500
03:17:56,930 --> 03:17:57,390
Okay, I'm out.

2501
03:18:01,400 --> 03:18:02,300
Oh shit!

2502
03:18:02,840 --> 03:18:03,560
That was an accident.

2503
03:18:04,180 --> 03:18:05,760
Oh, that was also an accident.

2504
03:18:11,490 --> 03:18:13,090
Oh no, I'm in the corner.

2505
03:18:13,950 --> 03:18:14,610
Oh no!

2506
03:18:17,810 --> 03:18:18,290
How?

2507
03:18:19,170 --> 03:18:19,950
Oh shit!

2508
03:18:20,570 --> 03:18:21,010
That's how.

2509
03:18:24,130 --> 03:18:25,590
Okay, I got really lucky there.

2510
03:18:26,450 --> 03:18:26,770
Fuck!

2511
03:18:27,790 --> 03:18:28,150
Fuck!

2512
03:18:30,090 --> 03:18:31,810
She says calmly.

2513
03:18:40,240 --> 03:18:42,580
I landed on her.

2514
03:18:45,300 --> 03:18:47,400
Alright, hee hee, thank you, welcome to tomato fight.

2515
03:18:47,420 --> 03:18:49,360
Welcome, welcome.

2516
03:18:50,020 --> 03:18:52,040
I don't remember I have two of these two.

2517
03:18:53,120 --> 03:18:54,320
Are you serious?

2518
03:18:54,620 --> 03:18:55,360
That hits me?

2519
03:19:00,560 --> 03:19:01,420
Alright, alright.

2520
03:19:01,540 --> 03:19:02,360
Okay, I'm locking in.

2521
03:19:02,440 --> 03:19:02,940
That's it.

2522
03:19:03,240 --> 03:19:04,380
She's taking too long.

2523
03:19:04,560 --> 03:19:05,240
It's time.

2524
03:19:06,100 --> 03:19:08,320
It's time to lock in.

2525
03:19:17,040 --> 03:19:17,920
Oh, fuck.

2526
03:19:20,480 --> 03:19:22,500
I just wanted to ring that bell.

2527
03:19:22,600 --> 03:19:23,520
It looks so ringable.

2528
03:19:25,180 --> 03:19:25,700
Alright.

2529
03:19:25,860 --> 03:19:26,140
Alright.

2530
03:19:27,220 --> 03:19:28,140
Is it?

2531
03:19:28,720 --> 03:19:29,380
Go focus.

2532
03:19:30,940 --> 03:19:31,540
Oh,

2533
03:19:51,450 --> 03:19:52,350

2534
03:19:52,790 --> 03:19:53,350
Oh, fuck!

2535
03:19:53,430 --> 03:19:54,370

2536
03:19:55,770 --> 03:19:56,330
This bad.

2537
03:19:58,870 --> 03:20:00,370
I actually messed up.

2538
03:20:09,270 --> 03:20:10,050
That's okay.

2539
03:20:12,610 --> 03:20:13,910
No, not the fire.

2540
03:20:14,290 --> 03:20:15,090
Not the fire!

2541
03:20:16,810 --> 03:20:17,430
Oh god!

2542
03:20:17,910 --> 03:20:18,290

2543
03:20:20,590 --> 03:20:21,470

i'm joking in the corner it speaks to me don't understand.

2546
03:20:59,240 --> 03:21:00,860
It's a very nice corner.

2547
03:21:03,100 --> 03:21:05,480
If you see it in person, you'd understand.

2548
03:21:10,470 --> 03:21:11,770
I can't help it.

2549
03:21:11,830 --> 03:21:12,530
It speaks.

2550
03:21:12,670 --> 03:21:14,190
It calls my name.

2551
03:21:14,490 --> 03:21:16,450
It's like, Doki, Doki.

2552
03:21:17,150 --> 03:21:18,310
Come back.

2553
03:21:18,410 --> 03:21:19,610
We missed you, Doki.

2554
03:21:21,010 --> 03:21:22,630
It's nice and dosi.

2555
03:21:23,010 --> 03:21:24,790
It's my little happy corner.

2556
03:22:10,780 --> 03:22:13,820
Oh my god, I hate that move so much.

2557
03:22:14,940 --> 03:22:19,740
Oh no, no, no, not the corner, not the corner, anything but the corner!

2558
03:22:28,040 --> 03:22:31,480
He does, like, the shot put throw.

2559
03:22:32,600 --> 03:22:39,700
And you remember which throw is, like, which throw is the one where he chucks it and which one when he swings it.

2560
03:22:40,780 --> 03:22:45,340
I think that's, like, what, like, I'm getting confused with.

2561
03:22:45,980 --> 03:22:48,620
Because sometimes I feel like it's the...

2562
03:22:53,840 --> 03:22:56,980
No, sometimes I think it's the one where she does the twerra.

2563
03:23:02,620 --> 03:23:16,000
I feel like sometimes she does the twirl but then she does the shot put and then that confuses me oh my god so I looked at chat so oh my god I looked at chat and then I got disoriented I

2564
03:23:27,000 --> 03:23:30,740
okay okay focus up focus up focus up this time

2565
03:23:39,420 --> 03:23:51,280
Yeah, but sometimes she like, I know you can't dodge, but like when she does the non-twirl, she like, she chucks it so far.

2566
03:23:55,380 --> 03:23:56,600
Like, see that's such a far chuck.

2567
03:24:00,600 --> 03:24:01,640
Oh my god.

2568
03:24:02,080 --> 03:24:03,900
Oh, the magic is over here.

2569
03:24:04,800 --> 03:24:06,440
But I just want to go.

2570
03:24:09,940 --> 03:24:11,340
Oh, no.

2571
03:24:22,330 --> 03:24:23,010
Friend.

2572
03:24:27,940 --> 03:24:29,180
Oh, my gosh.

2573
03:24:29,400 --> 03:24:30,060
That was an accident.

2574
03:24:36,630 --> 03:24:37,330
I wanted to grab.

2575
03:24:37,450 --> 03:24:38,010
I got greedy.

2576
03:24:38,410 --> 03:24:39,670
I got so greedy.

2577
03:24:42,950 --> 03:24:43,630
No!

2578
03:24:44,270 --> 03:24:45,670
Get me out of here!

2579
03:24:50,800 --> 03:24:51,480
Okay.

2580
03:24:54,620 --> 03:24:59,600
I'm so sad I'm so sad

2582
03:25:26,270 --> 03:25:29,050
It's literally I get confused.

2583
03:25:29,330 --> 03:25:29,710
It's the throw.

2584
03:25:29,950 --> 03:25:30,730
It's a fucking throw.

2585
03:25:31,110 --> 03:25:31,650
I don't know.

2586
03:25:31,770 --> 03:25:33,770
The range of her that throw could be anything

2587
03:25:39,820 --> 03:25:41,740
I'm slowly downloading it

2588
03:25:49,200 --> 03:25:51,780
Wee My

2589
03:26:10,910 --> 03:26:13,770

Oh what oh my god.

2591
03:26:21,060 --> 03:26:26,480
It's the I I forgot I forgot when she dashes a dash.

2592
03:26:26,660 --> 03:26:28,500
I got confused with my dash.

2593
03:26:32,020 --> 03:26:35,160

2594
03:26:36,280 --> 03:26:36,660
Okay.

2595
03:26:44,220 --> 03:26:44,720

That was my first mistake.

2608
03:28:09,540 --> 03:28:14,320
I was like, I can go close to her because there's no way she's going to do that again, right?

2609
03:28:20,760 --> 03:28:21,960
Alright, that's cool.

2610

I wanted to dash!

2622
03:30:40,940 --> 03:30:42,260
Ah, that threw me off!

2623
03:30:42,700 --> 03:30:45,760
I was trying to dash and I floated for some reason.

2624
03:30:46,800 --> 03:30:47,160

2625
03:30:48,620 --> 03:30:50,460
I got the right groove!

2626
03:30:56,210 --> 03:30:59,210
I think it's just that one enemy that pisses me off.

2627
03:30:59,690 --> 03:31:00,630
That little fly there.

2628
03:31:01,370 --> 03:31:02,470
He ruins everything.

2629
03:31:03,170 --> 03:31:04,650
The fly ruins it all.

2630
03:31:17,980 --> 03:31:18,600

Locked and loaded.

2635
03:31:28,440 --> 03:31:31,300
Eventually, if I say locked in enough, I will be locked in.

2636
03:31:32,220 --> 03:31:33,420
Not now though.

2637

Okay, I know that her family aren't judges.

2677
03:38:27,330 --> 03:38:29,670
She's the last judge, which means...

2678
03:38:31,010 --> 03:38:32,930
Doesn't mean her fucking kids.

2679
03:38:35,350 --> 03:38:36,070
Okay.

2680
03:38:39,650 --> 03:38:40,690
This way.

2686
03:39:11,300 --> 03:39:13,480
I don't understand how that hits me.

2687
03:39:27,710 --> 03:39:28,950
I'm just too close.

2688
03:39:29,050 --> 03:39:30,930
I get hit by a large ass head.

2689
03:39:36,080 --> 03:39:38,160

I hate starting this move.

2695
03:40:49,860 --> 03:40:52,140
I hate that one bug as well.

2696
03:40:52,800 --> 03:40:55,840
I hope when I kill the judge, he loses his job.

2697
03:40:56,560 --> 03:40:58,320
And then he'll be homeless.

2698
03:40:58,680 --> 03:40:59,880
I hope he becomes homeless.

2699
03:41:04,950 --> 03:41:11,810
And because he worked his entire career doing that, he'll never find another job because his resume is blank because he signed an NDA.

2700
03:41:19,920 --> 03:41:23,720
He'll be like, well, how come you have four to five years?

2701
03:41:23,960 --> 03:41:25,400
A gap on your resume.

2702
03:41:25,780 --> 03:41:27,100
He's like, I can't tell you.

2703
03:41:27,220 --> 03:41:28,000
I signed an NDA.

2704
03:41:39,610 --> 03:41:42,250
If I kill him, he'll never have another job.

2705
03:41:42,390 --> 03:41:44,590
That bug down there, he loses his job.

2706
03:41:45,310 --> 03:41:46,790
His only source of income.

2707
03:41:49,170 --> 03:41:51,530
I'm going to be ruining two families tonight.

2708
03:42:03,520 --> 03:42:05,380
God, I hate that dash move.

2709
03:42:06,080 --> 03:42:06,900
It's so annoying.

2710
03:42:12,060 --> 03:42:12,420
Alright.

2711
03:42:14,740 --> 03:42:15,820
Please let me on the other side.

2712
03:42:16,180 --> 03:42:17,160
Please let me on the other side.

2713
03:42:17,300 --> 03:42:18,440
My magic meter is right.

2714
03:42:18,480 --> 03:42:19,220
Okay, I don't need it.

2715
03:42:19,440 --> 03:42:19,620
Never mind.

2716
03:42:22,560 --> 03:42:23,240
Right here.

2717
03:42:26,280 --> 03:42:27,000
Oh my god.

2718
03:42:29,180 --> 03:42:30,340
I almost fucked it up.

2719
03:42:32,560 --> 03:42:33,320
Oh, I...

2720
03:42:33,320 --> 03:42:34,700
I don't know why I didn't register.

2721
03:42:34,840 --> 03:42:37,680
I didn't register that that was the charge hit

2722
03:42:43,810 --> 03:42:55,650
When Jesus

2723
03:43:00,910 --> 03:43:01,730
All right,

2724
03:43:08,260 --> 03:43:10,020
I forgot to register for that friend

2725
03:43:20,610 --> 03:43:22,670
No, that was a mistake

2726
03:43:47,390 --> 03:43:48,770
Oh, I walked into that.

2727
03:43:49,290 --> 03:43:50,530
Why was that so long?

2728
03:43:51,890 --> 03:43:54,470
I did not really It was so long

2729
03:43:57,880 --> 03:44:11,300
I hit phase three I was like, oh, it's over and then I did like I didn't register in my head that it kept going I didn't register that in my head.

2730
03:44:12,140 --> 03:44:29,060
I was like, yay, it's over It's over I literally stood still and I was like, yippee I like I got past that part That's stupid fire.

2731
03:44:32,480 --> 03:44:33,560
Oh my god.

2732
03:44:33,980 --> 03:44:34,820
Oh my god.

2733
03:44:34,900 --> 03:44:35,530
I made it.

2734
03:44:44,660 --> 03:44:45,240
Jesus.

2735
03:45:00,440 --> 03:45:01,100
Focus, focus, focus.

2736
03:45:01,380 --> 03:45:01,940
No yack, no yack.

2737
03:45:02,400 --> 03:45:04,260
Every time you yack, you lose your focus.

2738
03:45:08,440 --> 03:45:09,140
Sorry, I tank it.

2739
03:45:14,530 --> 03:45:15,630
Get me out of this corner.

2740
03:45:16,030 --> 03:45:17,270
Get me out of this corner.

2741
03:45:21,090 --> 03:45:22,510
Oh my gosh, she put me back in.

2742
03:45:22,810 --> 03:45:24,450
She put me back into the corner.

2744
03:45:27,630 --> 03:45:29,050
Guys, she put me back in.

2745
03:45:41,230 --> 03:45:43,470
Oh my god, I put myself in the corner.

2746
03:45:54,550 --> 03:45:55,870
I need to stop doing that.

2747
03:46:12,570 --> 03:46:13,270
Jesus.

2748
03:46:24,920 --> 03:46:25,220
Oh no.

2749
03:46:25,760 --> 03:46:26,120

2750
03:46:26,620 --> 03:46:28,120
My one weakness, the corner.

Fire, fire, fire, fire.

Oh my god!

2758
03:47:28,120 --> 03:47:30,540
Let's hope that doesn't fuck me up.

2759
03:47:30,540 --> 03:47:33,380

03:49:06,140 --> 03:49:06,580
Fuck.

2768
03:49:07,060 --> 03:49:07,640
It's over.

2769
03:49:08,220 --> 03:49:10,300
And then, obviously, though, it just gets worse.

2770
03:49:10,480 --> 03:49:11,760
The bosses just get worse.

2771
03:49:22,270 --> 03:49:23,810
Oh, my God.

2772
03:49:24,010 --> 03:49:24,730
It's over.

2773
03:49:25,790 --> 03:49:26,330
Act 2.

2774
03:49:26,430 --> 03:49:27,630
Tutorial is done.

2775
03:49:28,010 --> 03:49:29,390
We finished the tutorial.

2776
03:49:30,750 --> 03:49:32,430
Machina's playing a motto of the Citadel.

2777
03:49:33,150 --> 03:49:35,510
I just have to pay for this.

2778
03:49:36,130 --> 03:49:36,970
Break the glass.

2779
03:49:37,290 --> 03:49:38,930
The glass is breakable.

2780
03:49:39,590 --> 03:49:40,810
Just rob it.

2781
03:49:42,070 --> 03:49:42,170
Riot.

2782
03:49:49,150 --> 03:49:53,690
Why can't I riot and just break the fucking glass?

2783
03:49:55,850 --> 03:49:56,430
Need a boot.

2784
03:49:56,810 --> 03:49:58,450
Where the fuck is my bench?

2785
03:50:05,280 --> 03:50:06,770
Why can't I just steal it?

2786
03:50:09,260 --> 03:50:11,080
I am not a good citizen.

2787
03:50:11,900 --> 03:50:13,000
I've committed murder.

2788
03:50:16,860 --> 03:50:17,540
Come on.

2789
03:50:19,200 --> 03:50:20,460

2790
03:50:21,680 --> 03:50:22,320
Come on.

2791
03:50:22,740 --> 03:50:23,640
It's a tight fit.

2792
03:50:23,880 --> 03:50:24,260
Come on.

2793
03:50:24,460 --> 03:50:25,180

2796
03:50:27,940 --> 03:50:29,940
Well, now we're stuck here.

2797
03:50:33,530 --> 03:50:35,260

It's too late.

03:55:24,930 --> 03:55:26,150

03:55:32,270 --> 03:55:36,190
It's like, I like how they gave us two benches to pay to sit.

2851
03:55:39,370 --> 03:55:43,250
See, guys, super capitalism actually works.

2852
03:55:43,610 --> 03:55:59,210

What a lovely reward that Team Cherry gave me for beating the judge.

2860
03:56:30,790 --> 03:56:35,130
I get to pay for every minute that I get to sit on that bench.

2861
03:56:35,510 --> 03:56:36,350
Thank you, Team Cherry.

2862
03:56:36,490 --> 03:56:38,430
I won't have it any other way.

2863
03:56:38,830 --> 03:56:43,550
Hey, guys, I hope you get, I feel like I'm in New York City right now.

2864
03:56:43,610 --> 03:57:46,850
all right so rewarding you know they did that i remember i read an article that they that they um that they used to do that i don't know if it's new york city but i know it was in america because only amer only americans can think of such a brilliant way uh to to do phase two of capitalism but it was basically like god it's literally like this you rent a bench and if you don't pay for the bench the spikes come up so because like like now i think like now they're like okay that's like really fucked up we should just have the spikes come up during nighttime but like the original like the initial like beta test of those benches was literally like um the spikes would be up and then you have to you have to like pay like you have to use like coin like uh with coins you have to pause it with coins and then the spikes will come down after you pay for it and like timed and everything uh yeah it's like and it's not even like it's like their way of doing anti homeless bench but also like

2865
03:57:46,850 --> 03:58:09,630
monetizing it it's like real money uh i remember reading an article about it a long time ago i don't know i don't know if like if they still if they're still doing it But I think they I pretty sure they scrapped that idea

2866
03:58:12,890 --> 03:58:37,830
The anti-poor bench But anyway Anyway guys I'm gonna call it here I hope you guys all enjoyed today's stream It was I don't know if I say fun is the correct word To describe today's stream It was Definitely an experience.

2867
03:58:37,930 --> 03:58:54,870

2868
03:58:58,100 --> 03:58:59,590
