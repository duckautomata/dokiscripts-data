You gotta wait next week.

52
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,020
Because the what the fuck do you mean?

53
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,140
I don't know.

54
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,320
What?

55
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,860
What the fuck?

56
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:09,070
Okay, so I gave the job of drafting to my pro players.

57
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:12,550
And I was like, um, okay, so who do you want to take?

58
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,510
And then he was like, I don't know.

59
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,670
You had three days!

60
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,870
What do you mean you don't know?

61
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:22,610
I'm just the puppet!

62
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,550
I'm just, I'm just the proxy!

63
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,490
What the fuck do

64
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,390
you have the people in this tournament?

65
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:44,870
I don't even I mean I was like So what do you want for tank
Do you have the draft list because like you know I got a

66
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:55,810
draft And then he's like I don't know I fell for it again
Why do I keep falling for it again It never stops I keep

67
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:58,610
falling for it Again and again

68
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,450
Um And I'll keep doing it.

69
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:08,490
I'll never learn.

70
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,370
I'll never fucking learn.

71
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:16,330
So my assigned pros is trust me and speedily.

72
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,790
So yeah, and I was like, here's the list.

73
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,290
You do it.

74
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:27,030
I was just like, I don't know, half the people that's termed
it.

75
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:28,230
Here's the list.

76
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,930
Do my homework for me.

77
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,170
Do my homework.

78
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:41,810
I said I didn't want to be captain, but then Bulger told me,
he was like, oh, don't worry, the captains will be around

79
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:42,330
your level.

80
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:49,530
And then he listed Flats and Big Puffer, and then Puffer
couldn't make it in the end because he had something because

81
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,510
of the ice storm apparent, let's know, storm.

82
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:53,290
So he couldn't make it in the end.

83
00:05:53,950 --> 00:06:01,130
And then so I was just like, wait, the other captains were,
and then when all the other captains got confirmed, I was

84
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,010
like, wait a minute.

85
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:04,310
These captains aren't my level.

86
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:17,500
but he did say my pro players will do my homework for me and
i'm just i i told him straight up i will be a puppet i'm

87
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:30,060
just i'm just here for appearances i'm the proxy leader i'm
not the real leader i did tell him that um i did say that so

88
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:35,100
um so like i've said i no accountability

89
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,040
I was like, no accountability, yeah, I'll do it.

90
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,720
If only I get zero accountability.

91
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,120
So if my team loses, I can be like, I didn't pick the
people.

92
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,680
My pros, pros, pros.

93
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:59,860
I'd be like, actually, my assigned pros picked the team and
not me.

94
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,380
So in the end, is it really my fault?

95
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:04,940
Is it really?

96
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:20,880
accountability um yeah what why no this is like a this is
like 90% pros like no matter what meet my skill level

97
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:32,500
compared to a pro player is like a fucking Grand Canyon uh
because uh I do not play as much I do not eat sleep uh drink

98
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:39,180
uh sadly unfortunately I know it's actually by how much I
love Marvel Rivals.

99
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:48,280
I know it's actually crazy, but like, I need to break it to
you guys.

100
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,420
Marvel Rivals might not be my entire life, maybe.

101
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:00,740
Just, it might not be my whole life.

102
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,680
Just maybe, guys.

103
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,020
I might have a life outside of Marvel.

104
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:16,720

162
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:51,880

same dps first, Bouguer Bash, Emilio.

163
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,340
Oh, beautiful.

164
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:58,140
You're assembling the same team as the first one.

00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,640
All right, all right.

166
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,300
Very solid choice.

167
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,240
Very solid choice.

168
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,760
Now we have KG.

169
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,160
Okay, we want to take Malinia.

170
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,980
Still a very good choice right here, I'll be honest.

171
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,920
Next up, we have Team Captain.

172
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,460
Team Captain, what do you pick?

173
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,140

185
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,060
Moxie.

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

187
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,820
SK, two choices here.

188
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,440
Make the right one.

189
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,500
Hi, we're currently debating with the sources.

190
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,140
The sources are debating.

191
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:05,740
We're having a very thoughtful discussion between Kingsman
or Donatello.

192
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,780
It's very difficult because Kingsman is not there on the
first day, so you can't build as much synergy together.

193
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,500
That is true, that is true.

194
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,860
Wait, who is his sub, anyway?

195
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,160
It's an EU player.

196
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,400
Imagine EU Kingsman.

197
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,460
Oh, okay.

198
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,000
Place magic.

199
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,120
Oh, is it healers?

200
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:25,820
Place magic.

201
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,160
Place more nice.

202
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,780
Luke the Ninja 10 times better than Kingsman, okay?

203
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,060
He just hasn't had the time to shine, okay?

204
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,780
He was going band for band with craggy last tournament,
okay?

205
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,980
He was locking in.

206
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:37,520
I saw it.

207
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,920
It was like...

208
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,900
But he was the reason they lost.

209
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,080
He was the reason they lost.

210
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,280
So he's the anti-Kingsman.

211
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,480
It's like anti-venom.

212
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,940
Anti-venom and venom.

213
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,160
Beautiful.

214
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:51,540

218
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,520

00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,240
I think there are EU.

230
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:36,940
He's EU.

231
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,700
But EU, right, correct.

232
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:41,060
And very solid choice, very good support player.

I believe I think we are gonna go with Mash.

236
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,760
Mash is a very solid choice.

237
00:23:50,980 --> 00:24:00,600
i love playing with mashing rank very vocal very flexible
very smart and wins from comps i like your choice a lot i'm

244
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:13,220
right pick here okay and that is to form the danish trilogy

common danish oh my god that's not that's roasting me be

246
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:29,680
like why didn't the captains do their homework because i
honestly think it's a very good thing for you know because i

247
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:43,460
outsourced my homework i wait what's the word i i delegated
my homework to people who have more knowledge than me you

248
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:51,220
know i'm excited that you guys are playing together i told
someone else to do my homework and remember correctly As it

249
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:56,460
continues his tradition of being the last pick, the absolute
very last pick in Vogue or Bash.

250
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,160
I delegated my homework to my pros.

251
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,360
They're vastly underestimating the skill.

252
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,620
And they have more dollars than me.

253
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:06,780
Yep.

254
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,180
It's going to be high-fivered by...

255
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:12,860
I went to chat GPT and be like, who should I get?

256
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:13,740
Good teams.

257
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:17,580
I'll be honest, I know who to cheer for because I think
everybody has a really good team.

258
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,900
But, you know, I think you guys can find...

259
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:29,100
yeah a good captain surrounds us with people that can do
what they can exactly figure out your comps figure out what

260
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:37,020
you're gonna play and we're gonna start setting up lobbies
and uh you know may the best team win don't stress too much

261
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:43,740
uh but remember the vibes need to be good and this is not a
for fun tournament okay it is competitive at the end of the

262
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:52,240
day and uh you know i hope the pros give you a lot of good
comps a lot of good coaching and I hope all the streamers

263
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,980
perform really, really well.

264
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:59,240
If there's any big issues, always contact the staff and good
luck, have fun.

265
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,400
Good luck, guys.

Okay.

304
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,290

So you can pick Hell's Heaven set and then B is Cracoa,
Midtown, Symbiotic, or in Central Park.

306
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:25,450

I chose you because I need you to play Jeff.

309
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:30,790
You need a Jeff player.

310
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:32,110
You need a Jeff player.

311
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,630

312
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:37,790

313
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:38,050
Oh, V.

314
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,190
I think it's actually not bad, yeah.

315
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:43,850
Well, well, we picked you because you're a top 10 god.

316
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:44,530
Yeah, yeah.

317
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:47,530
I picked you because trust me told me to pick you.

318
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:50,070
Because you're the goat.

319
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:52,190
I'll pick that.

320
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:55,490
I believe

321
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:08,810
All right I believe guys Not last That is my goal today Well
I believe everyone else has a different goal from me But for

322
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:17,670
me it's not last I always go in with low expectations Go Go
in with low expectations Because then everything will be a

323
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:23,910
surprise Brew up some full dive synergy We can make it work
Alright guys I could tell you what's on the line for me if

324
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:33,730
you want if you want to know what i'm capable playing all
right all right got hawkeye all right okay i got i got well

325
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:42,270
you don't come out don't come out trust me uh spider-man all
right cap okay i still got a cap it's okay okay mantis if we

326
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:51,590
ever really need it you know maybe even the loki sometimes a
daredevil sometimes a bucky is a staple

327
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:06,980
i got a namor yep namor can we can you add a phoenix to that
arsenal i've played phoenix before that's good that's good

328
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:14,440
enough for me that's good enough i've had a season can you
can you beat tara on phoenix moxie do you think you could do

329
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:20,020
it if it was like bayblade time like i feel like i could
have pressed the buttons just as well as he did but the aim

330
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,460
i don't know it's a little weird

331
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:32,700
maybe maybe you get fully pocketed by two supports maybe you
got it maybe yeah maybe it was like a 2v1 he was like yeah

332
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:41,820
yeah 2v1 i think you can single like well not
single-handedly but like you know yeah maybe he's a funky

333
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:55,420
player i'll tell you that much it's okay we can do this guys
i forgot to get my cough drops i ran out last night we might

334
00:33:55,420 --> 00:34:02,740
have to is he better now yeah he's pretty he's pretty good
oh no i think we banned phoenix and things we also want to

335
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:12,920
play dive yeah i think last band maybe do you want to leave
loki open and ban mantis instead i really like mantis burn i

336
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:18,640
really don't want to play into mantis i think we're gonna
play full dive then loki's not that big of a deal no i think

337
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:28,180
it's okay loki's easier to dive than mantis personally yeah
they're they're cooking right now i'm just existing wait no

338
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:46,480
this is not the right is this i already said why did the
captain do her homework it was like i'm like um as a captain

339
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:57,140
i surround myself with peep i was told that i can delegate
my homework and I can just be like the face of the team.

340
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:04,820
I was told I could just have zero responsibilities.

341
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,720
I'm just here to look pretty.

342
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,060
Good for one.

343
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,340
Yeah, leaders don't need a tank.

344
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,300
We act.

345
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,540
Well, I don't know.

346
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,460
I don't think that's all yet.

347
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,800
But you guys see these like map sets though?

348
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,340
They're kind of interesting.

349
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:33,280
like the first one in my opinion yeah i think if one to play
full dive the first one is probably the best

350
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:46,390
it's going to be either a cap venom cap angela or venom
angela or venom deadpool we have infinite tanks to play and

351
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:55,070
you can always go magneto and aimbot them on controller
honey it doesn't say who gets two picks the map sets so i

352
00:35:55,070 --> 00:36:01,810
don't i don't know how that's going to be done yeah i don't
know either yeah i'm reading the rules it just says here are

353
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:10,570
the maps this but it doesn't say who gets which team picks
first maybe it's just like you play them in order of that

354
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:17,210
first game is always going to be a second game b c and then
it goes back a b c maybe i don't know

355
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:31,450
oh i'm gonna say i'm gonna ask who Which team which so what
should I be practicing in the range spider-man the map

356
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:34,030
That's all right.

357
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:39,310
I think you got to look at some hella This is our face of
our leader.

358
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:42,470
Yeah, you might have to play hella I will be honest.

359
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:53,570
I I'd much rather play Phoenix than hella But like that also
works for me If I have to it's very likely that I'm trying

360
00:36:53,570 --> 00:37:09,010
I'm not this maybe that would also be op i promise that's
okay all right what about talks about a hawkeye i need to

361
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:17,990
fix the audio right now for everyone i've just seen your
tweet talk about how the hawkeye is hawkeye is no hawkeye is

362
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:25,430
op bro but i'm i actually think people might ban it versus
us yeah that's what i'm banking on why we should be winning

363
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:38,190
like in the draft if they think i'm uh trust can come up a
bit all right i'm pushing trust a bit higher and then i

364
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:52,690
don't think you're an otp speed can come down a bit okay
you've seen me play cap all right there you go how the vibes

365
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:53,490

You know what?

371
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:22,350
We should have just ran a six stack of equipment.

372
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:23,810
Oh.

373
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:26,430

376
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:48,890
one me

377
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:55,890
in the range mate

378
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:06,840
i wanted to get lucia gold originally but i think the rp is
better not only i i kind of wanted to get lucia goat for the

379
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:20,740
hero pool how good is your thing lucia goat uh not lucia is
supposed to be hard he's like my plan was to not pick he's

380
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:32,200
so german by the way trust me it's german and you're like
damn that's you're like he's german by the way that's crazy

381
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:41,280
that's I actually wanted to pick this guy, but then I
thought maybe you have your bed.

382
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,100
Maybe you are a little better.

383
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:03,080
I'm telling you guys, worst comes to worst.

384
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:07,320
Like if every, let's say, let's say for some reason it's not
working.

385
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,360
The hot guys gotta be the craziest pick to just throw in
there.

386
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,020
You know?

387
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:12,820
I actually think you're right.

388
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,880
I think we should probably play it.

389
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,840
Okay, it's actually crazy.

390
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,320
I actually think Hawkeye is not bad.

391
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,920
If we can force a matchup where they go cloak and we get
Hawkeye, okay, I'm down to play.

392
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,220
It's actually funny because he was like, and then we just go
DRP.

393
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,480
He was like, he messaged me and he was like, oh, I think I
have an account on range, right?

00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:22,720
It's like, it's like, um, it's like where you yell out
spells and stuff and explore, explore dungeons.

456
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:26,580
It's a rare five people game.

457
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:27,640

the voices.

466
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:46,040
I was, I was going to keep police.

467
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,040
Zero accountability.

468
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:54,180
I think if my mic dies, I think I need to go headset mic at
one point.

469
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:55,640
Definitely will do it.

470
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,300
Wait, how bad is the headset mic?

471
00:48:58,440 --> 00:48:59,280
How bad is it?

472
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,180
It can't be that bad.

473
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:01,380
It's pretty bad.

474
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,200
I mean, we listen to Moxie all the time.

475
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:03,760
It's fine.

476
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:05,240
Yeah, it's actually Moxie.

477
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,660
It's a little bit more Moxie.

478
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:08,660
A little bit.

479
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:12,220
I think Moxie's mic is pretty alright.

480
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:15,440
Well, I think people overplay this.

481
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,440
Like, it sounds great to me.

482
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:19,940
Okay, you don't listen to yourself though.

483
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:21,080
Maybe.

484
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:24,860
Maybe.

485
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:25,160
Alright.

486
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:27,260
You can't.

487
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,000
Yes, I can.

488
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,240
I will delegate all responsibility.

489
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:32,800
Oh my god, stream together, Moxie.

490
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:34,220
Yes, sir.

491
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:35,180
I need everyone.

492
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,380
Ooh, I need to do something then.

493
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:54,000
i will all i'm saying is that i had because cheating
accusations i've seen them i i haven't looked into anything

494
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:02,660
i actually watched so much yesterday everybody was well yes
everyone was watching i actually think he's cheating as a

495
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:10,660
pro you think he's cheating yeah i think that I think people
were saying People were saying that It was very suspicious

496
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:17,900
because he had Other hackers in his chat Talking with like
he's friends with other Hackers so that's really sus That's

497
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:25,020
a little sussy In Overwatch an example I played with former
cheetahs on the team Usually the cheetahs are also good

498
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:34,420
aimers Like Like the There's some There's definitely some
truth to it You know like if you If you're not a bad aimer

499
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:40,360
to hide it it's like if you're very good chess player yeah
you can like cheat one or two moves you know i mean that's

500
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:47,900
like apex too yeah as long as you have the movement and like
the game sense you can hide cheese very well yeah i think so

501
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:54,240
too it's just like impossible to like actually prove that
he's cheating though nowadays unless like you like have him

502
00:50:54,240 --> 00:51:00,560
play on like have him play on land or something like that's
why he doesn't want to go pro he's also very young yeah

503
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:13,840
he's worried that he'll get caught i don't know about that
but i mean i know back how it was in overwatch you know like

504
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:21,160
it's actually very hard to prove someone is cheating oh like
yeah now nowadays though it's like literally impossible yeah

505
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:31,200
i know with like dma cheats and like oh yeah because the
cheats are more defied now yeah they're like expensive as

506
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:35,500
hell aren't they they're like you have to pay a monthly
subscription the good ones yeah the good ones really

507
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:46,500
expensive how much would it cost um yeah how much would they
cost speed yeah yeah yeah

508
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:59,300
well i have spoken with like some guy who's like involved
with that and he said like it is like probably like more

509
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:07,660
than like 15 i don't know it's like at least a thousand
dollars a month holy this is like rich kid shit yeah

510
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:16,240
actually would be these people are what these people like
cheat in like tournaments and shit to like get the winnings

511
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:23,440
to like you know yeah i mean that makes sense or the boost
you know yeah yeah then they can text it off you mean oh

512
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:33,620
yeah it's a business expense that's so smart pretty much so
funny oh my gosh cheat developers must be like crazy rich

513
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:36,040
description.

514
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:39,040
There's also ways to get it for free, I think.

515
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,340
But those are more detectable, aren't they?

516
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:42,880
Unless your friends with one.

517
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,620
You'd be like, hey, homie, hook me up.

518
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,320
Yo, bro, I heard you developing a cheat.

519
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:53,980
Yeah, that side lock was a little too good.

520
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:57,680
Yeah, let me 0.25 that real quick.

521
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:58,680

Yeah.

523
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:03,080
Well, I did play on land, so I'm cleared.

524
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:08,620
Wait, what place did you get placement did you get in land?

525
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:14,340
But you had it turned on, it would have been first, right?

526
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:15,420
Oh, maybe.

527
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:20,700

too smooth.

559
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:06,450
It's way too fast.

560
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:10,430
Good for low sense.

561
00:56:11,090 --> 00:56:11,250
Yeah.

562
00:56:12,270 --> 00:56:14,290
My sense isn't that low.

563
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:23,670
I think like I had sponsors gift me glass pads and then I
use it and I didn't want to waste it so I just gift it to my

564
00:56:23,670 --> 00:56:24,170
friends.

565
00:56:25,830 --> 00:56:26,230
W front?

566
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:28,570
Yeah, W front.

567
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:29,710
I resell that, fuck that.

568
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:31,290
You would resell it?

569
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:32,730
No, no.

570
00:56:34,070 --> 00:56:40,310
damn i'm gonna remember that when you get sponsored by a
mouse pad i'll be like i had like one like teammate a long

571
00:56:40,310 --> 00:56:46,470
time ago that had a glass pad that just seems like a pain in
the ass to carry around like it's like fragile too isn't it

572
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:54,150
a tournament or something it's just yeah yeah you gotta be
careful with that it can it can break oh they're doing

573
00:56:54,150 --> 00:57:03,810
balanced latency balance latency see no it says northern
virginia i don't want to play on 130 ping thank you very

574
00:57:03,810 --> 00:57:12,350
much yeah i think that's good wait art yeah wait i thought
it was north virginia no i think it's probably on a wait

575
00:57:12,350 --> 00:57:20,770
their team is just mostly eu on on i think is unplayable
yeah i know it's it's it's the useless i had i had necros

576
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:26,150
earlier and i think he was yeah he was playing on na and he
legit went like i think he was like one and seven or one and

577
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:27,330
eight At the start.

578
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:28,070
It's not playable.

579
00:57:28,350 --> 00:57:29,330
It's just so cooked.

580
00:57:30,370 --> 00:57:33,550
I think they set the server as like...

581
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:36,950
The East Coast, I think.

582
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:39,230
Yeah, it should be North Virginia.

583
00:57:40,170 --> 00:57:41,270
Oh, yeah, I get good ping, too.

584
00:57:41,710 --> 00:57:42,670
That's what they said.

585
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:45,990
Yeah, because their team is just full EU plus Vinny.

586
00:57:47,650 --> 00:57:49,630
Vinny's like their token ending.

587
00:57:49,850 --> 00:57:51,130
He always does this, man.

588
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:53,430
Wait, what placement did he get on Bulger Bash 1?

589
00:57:53,430 --> 00:57:54,710
Cheating his way to the end, huh?

590
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:55,810
With a ping.

591
00:57:57,010 --> 00:57:59,670
Any objections to the auto select server?

592
00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:02,350
We have very, very major objections.

593
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:10,650
I'm here to speak for, I'm here to fight for Vinny.

594
00:58:11,790 --> 00:58:15,890
What is, what is, what is, what is auto select server?

595
00:58:16,110 --> 00:58:17,750
They definitely just chose this.

596
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:35,050
See, I'm such a, see justice for Vinny.

597
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:38,170
Yeah, I'm not for ulterior motives, guys.

598
00:58:38,730 --> 00:58:40,590
Not for ulterior motives.

599
00:58:40,890 --> 00:58:42,790
I wanted... I wanted...

600
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:46,390
I wanted Vinny to have a good time.

601
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:48,790
I wanted the guy to have a good time on his team.

602
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:49,910
Yeah.

603
00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:56,030
Surely not.

604
00:58:56,370 --> 00:58:58,570
It's not like I'm on a hundred ping or anything.

605
00:59:01,730 --> 00:59:02,290

Yeah, now you, now we yield the rewards of the grant in the
EU.

613
00:59:45,610 --> 00:59:46,190
Holy ferment.

614
00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:49,170
You're fermenting in EU?

615
01:00:00,310 --> 01:00:02,050
Frankfurt and Warsaw.

616
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:07,370
I thought, I thought it said like on the, in the rules of
the servers in North Virginia.

617
01:00:08,370 --> 01:00:09,210
I thought it was.

618
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:09,950
I was told that.

619
01:00:10,770 --> 01:00:20,970
We have to do mandatory Virginia person I don't know how to
spell I don't know how to spell Virginia.

620
01:00:21,210 --> 01:00:26,830

That's good.

623
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,220
Pro player has more value than me.

624
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:39,080
I agree Well you say you don't know how to spell Virginia.

625
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:40,220
I don't know how to spell Virginia.

626
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:46,360
That's not good I have auto-correct, but there's no
auto-correct in Rivals.

627
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:51,820
The only text Virginia?

628
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:53,180
I'm not American.

629
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,720
I don't need to know American states.

630
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:58,140
Damn.

631
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:01,160
That's Loki's selfish of us.

632
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:03,280
Yeah, my bad.

633
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:06,200
Yeah, yeah, guys.

634
01:01:06,340 --> 01:01:09,720
I don't know if you know this, but there's more than just US
and NA.

635
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:13,300
to become a state.

636
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:18,280
Craigie and Green ping, huh?

637
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:23,700

I don't think... No, no.

642
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:32,340
Bougar was like...

643
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:35,400
No, Bougar was like, I don't care.

644
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:39,120
He's like, I don't care if you stream or not just have fun.

645
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:42,080
He was like, if you don't stream, I'm going to get the
viewers.

646
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:42,580
It's fine.

647
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:51,000

Wait, who's doing bands?

Give it to- No, give it to trust me.

661

See, we're on top of things.

662
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:14,100
Question is do we do group in here?

663
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:15,340
I don't think we should.

664
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:17,860
I trust the process.

665
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:23,360
We have DRP he can he can ult us I can yeah, or I can play
good.

01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:44,140
That's aura.

671
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:45,560
Does he have that one?

672
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:46,560
No, that's the beta.

01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:48,200

I get it.

679
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:20,920
Okay.

680
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:23,200
Are you guys putting comms and everything on?

681
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:24,540
Or off the one face?

682
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:25,540
Okay.

683
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:27,100
It's always on.

684
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:28,140
Okay, okay.

685
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:29,080
Be away with it.

686
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:29,600
Be away with it.

687
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:30,940
Okay.

688
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:32,200
Guys, I also...

689
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:35,380
I also fixed this audio guys.

690
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:37,200
I adjusted audio guys.

691
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:39,820
There's no way they'll stream snipe.

692
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:42,620
That's messed up.

693
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:43,420
Yeah.

694
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:45,540
That's messed up.

695
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:46,200
Yeah.

696
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:47,100
I don't think they'll seem to say.

697
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:48,160
Loki safe.

698
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:50,900
Mantis safe is actually a problem, unironically.

699
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:53,040
Hmm.

700
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:54,180
That's actually not too bad.

701
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:55,560
We're saving Daredevil, right?

702
01:04:56,180 --> 01:04:56,500
Yeah.

703
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:58,840
I'm not giving back to a Benton this year.

704
01:04:59,020 --> 01:04:59,900
I've been Mantis for sure.

705
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,380
But I need to get cough drops.

706
01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:04,240
No, I don't want.

707
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:04,960
I think we...

708
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,900
Sorry, I actually am muting myself when I said that.

709
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:08,460
I was just trying to say that to you guys.

710
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:10,920
I didn't get cough drops after this game.

711
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:13,180
I think that makes more sense.

712
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:15,140
Give me safe DD.

713
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:21,900
trying to tell that to you guys like defeat in this now we
can't defeat in this tomorrow so we should try to defeat it

714
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:27,340
now yeah let's see they ban

715
01:05:33,270 --> 01:05:36,090
let's see let's see if they're thinking

716
01:05:41,810 --> 01:05:50,870
oh so that shouldn't matter for us right yeah it's pretty
good for us honestly yeah it's always been loki uh that is a

717
01:05:50,870 --> 01:05:51,830
question Phoenix or thing?

718
01:05:53,110 --> 01:05:54,410
I actually want to ban Phoenix.

719
01:05:54,730 --> 01:05:55,650
I think it's much stronger.

720
01:05:56,550 --> 01:05:58,670
I don't think themes will last say theme, too.

721
01:05:59,730 --> 01:06:00,490
Yeah, last ban thing.

722
01:06:02,410 --> 01:06:05,050
I think if they don't save it, then you can always spend
some time.

723
01:06:05,370 --> 01:06:08,590
I think they will save thing if they see a DD save.

724
01:06:09,710 --> 01:06:10,750
They just fucked up.

725
01:06:11,370 --> 01:06:12,470
I think they're going to save it, isn't it?

726
01:06:12,530 --> 01:06:14,170
That's my bad sound guy.

727
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:19,010
I accidentally lowered Discord and upped my game volume.

728
01:06:19,010 --> 01:06:20,590
And then upped my game volume.

729
01:06:21,170 --> 01:06:30,670
should be so you might never eat balance because my discord
i accidentally lowered it to my game volume i did i miss red

730
01:06:30,670 --> 01:06:38,090
yeah there it is i miss red so my game volume is normal now
and then w

731
01:06:42,450 --> 01:06:49,890
that's my bad i have to keep at this though because all my
my other collabs are at this Wait, what is my audio?

732
01:06:50,250 --> 01:06:51,070
Is it 9.5?

733
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:52,770
9.8?

734
01:06:52,970 --> 01:06:54,910
They're gonna go, they're gonna, yeah, actually I think.

735
01:06:54,970 --> 01:06:56,270
I don't remember sound guy.

736
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:57,530
I wrote it down for you.

737
01:06:57,730 --> 01:06:58,230
You have it.

738
01:06:58,310 --> 01:06:59,310
You have the record.

739
01:07:00,370 --> 01:07:01,250
But I think it's fine.

740
01:07:01,930 --> 01:07:02,750
Wait, what do I play?

741
01:07:03,850 --> 01:07:04,950
Yeah, what do you want in the bug line?

742
01:07:05,170 --> 01:07:06,690
I think we go...

743
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:08,070
Do we go full dive?

744
01:07:08,690 --> 01:07:09,590
We can't try it.

745
01:07:09,910 --> 01:07:11,330
If you play Hawkeye, I don't think...

746
01:07:11,890 --> 01:07:12,250
Yeah.

747
01:07:12,450 --> 01:07:14,810
Now, if we want to play Hawkeye, then not, but otherwise we
can.

748
01:07:16,290 --> 01:07:22,450
Like, I would want to play probably can we go triple it's
open.

749
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:23,390
I think we should play it.

750
01:07:23,490 --> 01:07:28,310
I think we should play Mantis, Adam, Invis and then should I
play?

751
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:29,550
Well, I play.

752
01:07:30,870 --> 01:07:31,310
Alright.

753
01:07:32,210 --> 01:07:32,230
Alright.

754
01:07:32,230 --> 01:07:33,110
You know, I'll play Mantis.

755
01:07:34,030 --> 01:07:34,990
Yeah, I think you go Mantis.

756
01:07:35,270 --> 01:07:36,870
I think on this map we try this.

757
01:07:37,010 --> 01:07:38,210
Next map we can go full dive.

758
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:42,190
If it's the open map, it's pretty bad for Arco.

759
01:07:43,570 --> 01:07:44,370
Or Sound guy, quick!

760
01:07:45,010 --> 01:07:45,010
Quick!

761
01:07:45,290 --> 01:07:45,950
Fix this!

762
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:47,190
Fix this Sound guy!

763
01:07:47,330 --> 01:07:47,590
I'm sorry!

764
01:07:47,770 --> 01:07:48,850
I think you got Adam though.

765
01:07:49,070 --> 01:07:50,370
You can go Cloak as well.

766
01:07:50,450 --> 01:07:52,170
I gotta fix this!

767
01:07:52,270 --> 01:07:52,590
I messed up!

768
01:07:52,590 --> 01:07:54,190
I think Loki Cloak is better.

769
01:07:55,310 --> 01:07:55,710
Go Cloak.

770
01:07:55,850 --> 01:07:56,970
Go Cloak.

771
01:07:57,130 --> 01:07:57,910
Instead of Adam.

772
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:00,770
I will bring...

773
01:08:00,770 --> 01:08:00,790
Yeah.

774
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:01,650
Okay.

775
01:08:02,270 --> 01:08:03,390
Do the team up solid.

776
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:04,690
Yeah.

777
01:08:05,050 --> 01:08:05,370
Just saying.

778
01:08:06,370 --> 01:08:07,250
All right.

779
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:07,990
Okay.

780
01:08:08,270 --> 01:08:10,390
If they play Hella anymore, I'm just gonna match their
Hella.

781
01:08:10,990 --> 01:08:11,290
Yeah.

782
01:08:11,470 --> 01:08:12,190
People's always fun.

783
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:13,570
Just red.

784
01:08:15,450 --> 01:08:17,010
You need to see.

785
01:08:17,670 --> 01:08:18,070
Okay.

786
01:08:18,070 --> 01:08:19,190
Can we break this?

787
01:08:19,450 --> 01:08:20,170
Yeah, what they have?

788
01:08:20,490 --> 01:08:20,930
Oh, pause.

789
01:08:21,110 --> 01:08:21,690
My FTP actually.

790
01:08:22,470 --> 01:08:23,050
Actually, pause.

791
01:08:24,470 --> 01:08:25,470
Sound guy, you're saved.

792
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:26,190
Fix this.

793
01:08:29,150 --> 01:08:31,290
Do you want me to do an old truck and old stuff?

794
01:08:31,650 --> 01:08:31,750
No, no.

795
01:08:31,890 --> 01:08:32,490
Fix this now.

796
01:08:32,770 --> 01:08:33,190
We're paused.

797
01:08:33,930 --> 01:08:34,350
I'll ask.

798
01:08:34,350 --> 01:08:34,650
I'll ask for her.

799
01:08:35,190 --> 01:08:38,810
I'll always ask after ult every fight and then I'll make a
plan for the next one.

800
01:08:38,810 --> 01:08:38,950
All right.

801
01:08:39,230 --> 01:08:39,470
All right.

802
01:08:39,570 --> 01:08:39,870
I lowered.

803
01:08:40,070 --> 01:08:40,730
I lowered it.

804
01:08:40,770 --> 01:08:43,310
I lowered the discord and then we'll fix it later.

805
01:08:43,890 --> 01:08:44,450
Let's see it.

806
01:08:45,970 --> 01:08:46,750
Melio internet.

807
01:08:47,010 --> 01:08:48,890
not good

808
01:08:57,070 --> 01:09:09,890
wait do I do initiate confirmation or wait for them wait for
them you gotta wait for them I can't click continue but I

809
01:09:09,890 --> 01:09:17,450
don't want to do that I can also initiate it too we can
initiate confirmation I

810
01:09:22,270 --> 01:09:33,070
mean this is kind of weird to be honest sound got fixed no
are we saving the dive for the second day can't fix the game

811
01:09:33,070 --> 01:09:41,390
we can go dive after this i just think on this map we can't
really play dive oh i knew something was weird i mean we can

812
01:09:41,390 --> 01:09:50,470
take above them but it's like still super i hope you guys
could have heard me i think uh what did we last bend again

813
01:09:50,470 --> 01:09:58,550
in this i guess i guess i mean that's a good last bend
they're gonna be on loki cloak sorry i just didn't know how

814
01:09:58,550 --> 01:10:06,010
to read all right i've lowered the discord i don't think
they will go i think cloak is better i'll lower that discord

815
01:10:06,010 --> 01:10:11,890
and one who figures this out yeah very important is when
they have cloak and we play full dive is that we like

816
01:10:11,890 --> 01:10:17,570
respect each cloak we can we can't kill through so we just
like in this matchup we can but in the full dive i don't

817
01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:26,670
think we do yeah don't we just play for rocker yeah yeah
sorry guys i'm illiterate i can't stop to have to protect

818
01:10:26,670 --> 01:10:34,970
moxie i just know it starts with virgin and then i don't
know how it goes after don't worry more pressure is good it

819
01:10:34,970 --> 01:10:37,670
makes you lock in more right

820
01:10:41,530 --> 01:10:54,790
may need to be a bit lower all right i lowered it even more
there you go i don't know i'm not american already yeah

821
01:10:54,790 --> 01:10:56,030

822
01:11:05,990 --> 01:11:07,050

That's good.

826
01:11:12,690 --> 01:11:13,870
We have increased pressure.

827
01:11:14,630 --> 01:11:15,910
The Hella, Neymar's going to play.

828
01:11:16,610 --> 01:11:18,030
Yeah, I'm playing Hella on the right.

829
01:11:18,330 --> 01:11:18,970
Wait, I want him.

830
01:11:19,070 --> 01:11:19,390
I want him.

831
01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:20,090
No big wall.

832
01:11:20,170 --> 01:11:20,550
Can we walk?

833
01:11:21,030 --> 01:11:21,950
Two, one.

834
01:11:22,250 --> 01:11:23,370
Kill thing, kill thing, kill thing.

835
01:11:23,610 --> 01:11:23,970
Yes.

836
01:11:24,230 --> 01:11:25,390
Thing one, thing one, thing one.

837
01:11:26,330 --> 01:11:26,870

838
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:27,190
Hello me.

839
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:27,930
No way.

840
01:11:27,970 --> 01:11:28,530
No way.

841
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:28,910
Go on.

842
01:11:28,970 --> 01:11:29,050
Yeah.

843
01:11:30,790 --> 01:11:30,870
Yeah.

844
01:11:32,950 --> 01:11:35,750
Oh, think it's low.

845
01:11:35,930 --> 01:11:36,270
Think it's low.

846
01:11:36,410 --> 01:11:36,910
We can chase him.

847
01:11:36,990 --> 01:11:37,430
Pink is one.

848
01:11:37,790 --> 01:11:38,270
Yeah, just wait.

849
01:11:38,810 --> 01:11:39,450
All right.

850
01:11:39,570 --> 01:11:39,870
I mean, just.

851
01:11:40,190 --> 01:11:40,310
Go bunk up.

852
01:11:40,370 --> 01:11:41,090
Go bunk on point.

853
01:11:41,810 --> 01:11:41,930
Okay.

854
01:11:42,350 --> 01:11:42,550
Yeah.

855
01:11:43,070 --> 01:11:44,390
Can you, can you deny it?

856
01:11:45,230 --> 01:11:46,330
I can match.

857
01:11:46,770 --> 01:11:47,250
I can match.

858
01:11:47,630 --> 01:11:48,750
Yeah, I can match.

859
01:11:48,750 --> 01:11:49,110
Yeah.

860
01:11:51,330 --> 01:11:53,670
But I want to deny it early if they take high ground.

861
01:11:54,050 --> 01:11:54,910
I'm scouting that side.

862
01:11:55,290 --> 01:11:56,010
I don't see anyone coming down.

863
01:11:56,370 --> 01:11:56,850
I think they go high.

864
01:11:57,470 --> 01:11:58,670
I think they go high.

865
01:11:59,130 --> 01:11:59,710
Yeah, they go high.

866
01:11:59,910 --> 01:12:00,350
They have Hella.

867
01:12:00,370 --> 01:12:00,950
They have Hella no more.

868
01:12:01,070 --> 01:12:01,530
They saw Hella no more.

869
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:02,850
We can play the Booper, I think.

870
01:12:04,870 --> 01:12:05,190
Okay.

871
01:12:05,490 --> 01:12:06,970
They're having walked out.

872
01:12:07,290 --> 01:12:07,910
What the fuck are they doing?

873
01:12:08,530 --> 01:12:08,930
I hear a main.

874
01:12:09,410 --> 01:12:09,730
I hear a main.

875
01:12:09,830 --> 01:12:10,230
They're all dead.

876
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:10,790
Main, main, main.

877
01:12:10,790 --> 01:12:11,110
Hella top.

878
01:12:11,730 --> 01:12:11,850

01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:16,430
Okay.

01:12:16,810 --> 01:12:17,730

884
01:12:17,790 --> 01:12:18,530
Neema going bottom left.

885
01:12:18,590 --> 01:12:18,990
Can someone match?

886
01:12:19,010 --> 01:12:19,890
Yeah, I can't, I can't.

887
01:12:20,150 --> 01:12:21,630
Match him, match him, match him, match him, match him.

01:12:22,170 --> 01:12:23,010

Just wait.

907
01:13:11,330 --> 01:13:11,490

908
01:13:12,330 --> 01:13:12,990
I have it.

909
01:13:13,090 --> 01:13:13,350
I have it.

910
01:13:13,770 --> 01:13:14,770
I use it for Grutal.

911
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:15,450
I'll use it for Grutal.

912
01:13:15,810 --> 01:13:16,330
Just wait.

913
01:13:16,670 --> 01:13:16,750
Yep.

914
01:13:17,090 --> 01:13:17,690
Wolf is coming.

915
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:18,170
Wolf right side.

916
01:13:18,970 --> 01:13:20,070
I can eat Grutal probably.

917
01:13:20,630 --> 01:13:21,390
Can we deny Wolf?

918
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:21,850
Right side.

919
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:22,670
Can we walk into him?

920
01:13:23,870 --> 01:13:25,450
Looks like I'm in the wrong way.

921
01:13:25,450 --> 01:13:25,930
Wolf's up and up.

922
01:13:25,930 --> 01:13:27,130
No, no.

923
01:13:27,390 --> 01:13:28,330
Oh, okay.

924
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:28,970
It's okay.

925
01:13:28,990 --> 01:13:29,690
I hit the back up.

926
01:13:29,730 --> 01:13:30,430
Hey the wolf, get the wolf!

927
01:13:31,190 --> 01:13:33,850
Kill the wolf on the right, wolf on the right!

928
01:13:34,050 --> 01:13:36,430
One, one, one, one, one.

929
01:13:36,470 --> 01:13:37,090
He's gonna name all.

930
01:13:37,150 --> 01:13:37,970
He's gonna name all, yes.

931
01:13:38,830 --> 01:13:40,230
Yeah, I want to hold aggressive here to call something.

932
01:13:40,270 --> 01:13:40,590
Yeah.

933
01:13:40,590 --> 01:13:40,930
A kill, kill the wolf.

934
01:13:41,130 --> 01:13:41,450
Yeah.

935
01:13:41,590 --> 01:13:44,870
We have one, the wolf one.

936
01:13:45,130 --> 01:13:46,210
We're ready.

937
01:13:46,290 --> 01:13:46,850
They were there.

938
01:13:47,630 --> 01:13:49,370
Three, two, one.

939
01:13:51,090 --> 01:13:51,710
Oh, shit.

940
01:13:52,450 --> 01:13:53,190
Yeah, I'm not even leaving.

941
01:13:53,610 --> 01:13:53,770
Nope.

942
01:13:53,870 --> 01:13:54,550
I have to leave.

943
01:13:54,950 --> 01:13:55,850
I have to leave.

944
01:13:55,970 --> 01:13:56,410
Yeah, yeah.

945
01:13:56,410 --> 01:13:57,690
I have to leave because I'm mad.

946
01:13:58,150 --> 01:13:58,470
We killed.

947
01:13:58,570 --> 01:13:58,710
We killed.

948
01:13:59,050 --> 01:13:59,050
We killed.

949
01:13:59,130 --> 01:13:59,870
Just killed.

950
01:14:01,850 --> 01:14:02,030
We killed.

951
01:14:02,150 --> 01:14:02,650
We killed.

952
01:14:02,650 --> 01:14:03,190
We got you.

953
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:06,090
We got you.

954
01:14:06,770 --> 01:14:07,250
Let's go.

955
01:14:07,690 --> 01:14:08,050
Let's go.

956
01:14:08,630 --> 01:14:08,810
Let's go.

957
01:14:11,550 --> 01:14:12,570
We don't cover much.

958
01:14:12,690 --> 01:14:13,010
We don't cover much.

959
01:14:13,370 --> 01:14:13,850
Live it.

960
01:14:13,910 --> 01:14:14,630
Live it.

961
01:14:14,730 --> 01:14:14,890
Live it.

962
01:14:15,010 --> 01:14:15,150
Live it.

963
01:14:15,450 --> 01:14:15,950
I touch.

964
01:14:16,430 --> 01:14:16,570
I touch.

965
01:14:16,590 --> 01:14:16,750
Just live.

966
01:14:16,950 --> 01:14:17,070
Just live.

967
01:14:17,270 --> 01:14:17,410
Just live.

968
01:14:18,430 --> 01:14:18,730
I'm one.

969
01:14:18,950 --> 01:14:19,310
I'm dead.

970
01:14:20,030 --> 01:14:20,850
Oh, you're dead.

971
01:14:24,050 --> 01:14:24,930
I'm always like a mental.

972
01:14:25,050 --> 01:14:25,870
It's like a mental assault.

973
01:14:26,450 --> 01:14:26,670
Yeah.

974
01:14:26,710 --> 01:14:27,270
Maybe the RP can kill you.

975
01:14:27,270 --> 01:14:28,370
No, no, no, no, no, no.

976
01:14:28,450 --> 01:14:28,990
I think we die.

977
01:14:29,930 --> 01:14:30,570
I think we die.

978
01:14:30,830 --> 01:14:31,030
Yeah.

979
01:14:32,370 --> 01:14:33,510
They have marked them.

980
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:33,790
They have nothing.

981
01:14:35,430 --> 01:14:38,190
I think we go high ground and we just drop on them with
mental assault.

982
01:14:39,770 --> 01:14:40,170
All right.

983
01:14:40,370 --> 01:14:41,050
Don't think we need more.

984
01:14:42,210 --> 01:14:43,570
They don't have any more ult.

985
01:14:44,430 --> 01:14:44,450
Yeah.

986
01:14:44,930 --> 01:14:46,210
They have no more ult.

987
01:14:46,210 --> 01:14:46,770
They have a name.

988
01:14:46,770 --> 01:14:46,810
Okay.

989
01:14:46,810 --> 01:14:47,950
They stack up and walk up together.

990
01:14:48,010 --> 01:14:49,170
Use both support ults.

991
01:14:49,330 --> 01:14:49,650
I'm pretty sure.

992
01:14:49,830 --> 01:14:50,510
I think we just go with his net.

993
01:14:50,510 --> 01:14:50,930
It's not.

994
01:14:51,210 --> 01:14:52,350
Can we just go left?

995
01:14:52,630 --> 01:14:52,710
Okay.

996
01:14:53,870 --> 01:14:55,530
I think we go top, go top.

997
01:14:55,930 --> 01:14:56,310
Come on.

998
01:14:57,230 --> 01:14:57,650
Go top.

999
01:14:58,270 --> 01:14:58,910
Yeah, I'm the last one.

1000
01:14:59,110 --> 01:14:59,450
I'm the last one.

1001
01:14:59,550 --> 01:15:00,310
Here, wait, we're going.

1002
01:15:00,470 --> 01:15:00,670
We're going.

1003
01:15:02,490 --> 01:15:04,270
Go top, go top and then drop on Nebuchadnezzar.

1004
01:15:04,770 --> 01:15:05,870
You have to go left or right?

1005
01:15:06,870 --> 01:15:07,810
Left, left, left, left.

1006
01:15:07,990 --> 01:15:08,730
They're gonna flip.

1007
01:15:09,590 --> 01:15:10,450
They have Luna now.

1008
01:15:10,990 --> 01:15:11,470
Go drop on them.

1009
01:15:11,870 --> 01:15:12,230
Oh, mid.

1010
01:15:12,390 --> 01:15:12,950
Come on, come, come.

1011
01:15:13,650 --> 01:15:14,330
Come, come, come, come, come.

1012
01:15:14,350 --> 01:15:15,010
Oh, there's more apps.

1013
01:15:15,450 --> 01:15:16,650
I blind the...

1014
01:15:16,650 --> 01:15:17,270
I blind my egg.

1015
01:15:18,950 --> 01:15:19,470
Where's Chris left?

1016
01:15:20,030 --> 01:15:20,290
Oh.

1017
01:15:21,010 --> 01:15:21,850
Okay, okay.

1018
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:23,810
Oh, he's right.

1019
01:15:52,450 --> 01:15:53,850
No more, no more.

1020
01:15:53,850 --> 01:15:56,290
I actually need to win.

1021
01:15:56,730 --> 01:15:57,250
Yeah, it's really good.

1022
01:15:57,470 --> 01:15:58,210
I blinded.

1023
01:15:59,850 --> 01:16:02,270
I still have Cloak ult.

1024
01:16:02,330 --> 01:16:02,930
Thanks, we did it.

1025
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:04,330
Go to Adam.

1026
01:16:04,670 --> 01:16:06,530
Go dive now.

1027
01:16:06,810 --> 01:16:07,570
Surprise them.

1028
01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:11,490
I go dive with Cap, I think.

1029
01:16:12,150 --> 01:16:14,850
Do I stay Cloak or we lose all of them?

1030
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:15,650
I think we stay for ult.

1031
01:16:15,890 --> 01:16:16,170
Okay.

1032
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:18,610
If the inside map, it's good for Hawkeye too.

1033
01:16:18,710 --> 01:16:19,770
The outside is really bad.

1034
01:16:19,950 --> 01:16:21,310
Actually, just stay all together, I think.

1035
01:16:22,190 --> 01:16:22,930
Yeah, I think we still.

1036
01:16:23,850 --> 01:16:26,090
I only go Angela.

1037
01:16:26,310 --> 01:16:28,830
Wait, oh wait, is Discord better sound guy?

1038
01:16:29,410 --> 01:16:30,750
Give me one second.

1039
01:16:31,150 --> 01:16:32,250
Yeah, yeah.

1040
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:34,490
What did Craigie's team get last Bougar Bash?

1041
01:16:34,670 --> 01:16:35,730
What placement was he?

1042
01:16:35,730 --> 01:16:36,870
30 seconds before you attack?

1043
01:16:37,270 --> 01:16:37,710
I think last.

1044
01:16:39,210 --> 01:16:39,490
Oh, wait.

1045
01:16:39,690 --> 01:16:40,590
Six, six places.

1046
01:16:40,750 --> 01:16:41,670
I think it was fifth or sixth.

1047
01:16:42,010 --> 01:16:42,470
Oh, yeah.

1048
01:16:42,650 --> 01:16:43,950
Six places, I think.

1049
01:16:44,330 --> 01:16:47,070
I think Nevix got last and also.

1050
01:16:47,470 --> 01:16:47,570
No.

1051
01:16:48,730 --> 01:16:50,050
I don't know.

1052
01:16:50,310 --> 01:16:50,590
I don't know.

1053
01:16:50,590 --> 01:16:50,650
I don't know.

1054
01:16:52,030 --> 01:16:53,470
I mean, Nevix team was kind of cooked.

1055
01:16:53,850 --> 01:16:55,850
I think they're like 60 on Groot.

1056
01:16:56,690 --> 01:16:58,150
Yeah, I might just keep my ult for him.

1057
01:16:58,210 --> 01:16:58,470
Okay.

1058
01:16:58,930 --> 01:16:59,870
I mean, I have my ult.

1059
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:03,690
Yeah, I mean, I'll try to do it if I don't use it.

1060
01:17:04,050 --> 01:17:04,590
Oh yeah, okay.

1061
01:17:05,630 --> 01:17:07,810
All you need to do is capture the mission area.

1062
01:17:08,370 --> 01:17:08,550
Got it?

1063
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:09,950
I can play it to hit.

1064
01:17:10,430 --> 01:17:11,950
We should let that Groot walk up though.

1065
01:17:12,170 --> 01:17:13,410
Let them walk up through the choke, okay?

1066
01:17:13,450 --> 01:17:14,730
I hit when they're a tanker touching point.

1067
01:17:14,890 --> 01:17:15,470
They go dive too.

1068
01:17:15,730 --> 01:17:16,530
Yeah, they have Jeff.

1069
01:17:16,890 --> 01:17:17,750
Yeah, they have Jeff.

1070
01:17:19,090 --> 01:17:19,770
They have Hawkeye.

1071
01:17:19,770 --> 01:17:20,590
They have Hawkeye main.

1072
01:17:21,290 --> 01:17:22,990
Yeah, we can push Hawkeye and then we can close.

1073
01:17:23,850 --> 01:17:24,570
That's my friend.

1074
01:17:25,370 --> 01:17:25,730
Thanks.

1075
01:17:26,950 --> 01:17:27,730
Shark is in top right.

1076
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:28,270
Random half.

1077
01:17:28,450 --> 01:17:28,610
Okay, Jeff.

1078
01:17:28,870 --> 01:17:29,130
Okay, I'm on Jeff.

1079
01:17:29,890 --> 01:17:30,910
Yeah, I'm going Hawkeye.

1080
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:32,270
Two, one.

1081
01:17:32,770 --> 01:17:33,190
Hawkeye in.

1082
01:17:33,530 --> 01:17:33,950
Kill Hawkeye.

1083
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:36,570
Can you cloak out and you push Hawkeye?

1084
01:17:36,710 --> 01:17:38,170
Yeah, I'll cloak out right now.

1085
01:17:38,390 --> 01:17:38,810
I'll push back then.

1086
01:17:38,970 --> 01:17:39,430
I'll push back then.

1087
01:17:40,210 --> 01:17:42,190
Oh, they do not.

1088
01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:43,870
Okay, Hawkeye.

1089
01:17:44,010 --> 01:17:44,250
Okay, Hawkeye.

1090
01:17:44,390 --> 01:17:44,670
Don't get me.

1091
01:17:44,930 --> 01:17:45,710
Oh, I tried.

1092
01:17:46,010 --> 01:17:46,350
Oh, you got res.

1093
01:17:46,630 --> 01:17:48,610
Yeah, I didn't realize you got res.

1094
01:17:48,810 --> 01:17:50,670
I was trying to get out.

1095
01:17:51,450 --> 01:17:51,870
Back then, no.

1096
01:17:52,030 --> 01:17:52,790
I break, I break bubble.

1097
01:17:53,330 --> 01:17:53,730
I can't.

1098
01:17:53,850 --> 01:17:55,010
I need to go back.

1099
01:17:55,050 --> 01:17:55,570
I'm one, I'm one.

1100
01:17:55,590 --> 01:17:56,850
I kill Venom, Venom one.

1101
01:17:57,850 --> 01:17:58,550
It's winnable, it's winnable.

1102
01:17:58,810 --> 01:17:59,150
I can always after.

1103
01:17:59,670 --> 01:18:00,130
I can always after.

1104
01:18:02,150 --> 01:18:02,470
He's dead after.

1105
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:02,990
He didn't get anyone.

1106
01:18:03,010 --> 01:18:04,130
Two, one, just one.

1107
01:18:04,490 --> 01:18:05,570
Winnable, winnable, winnable.

1108
01:18:05,870 --> 01:18:06,290
Just play slow.

1109
01:18:06,610 --> 01:18:07,230
We will stop.

1110
01:18:07,230 --> 01:18:08,090
We will stop.

1111
01:18:08,310 --> 01:18:08,530
We will stop.

1112
01:18:08,810 --> 01:18:10,970
No, no, no, wait.

1113
01:18:11,130 --> 01:18:11,830
They're off Venom.

1114
01:18:11,990 --> 01:18:12,530
They're on Angela.

1115
01:18:12,830 --> 01:18:13,790
They're Angela's coming back.

1116
01:18:13,910 --> 01:18:14,390
Live it right now.

1117
01:18:14,450 --> 01:18:14,650
Live it right now.

1118
01:18:14,650 --> 01:18:15,070
Wait a minute.

1119
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:15,410
Wait a minute.

1120
01:18:15,530 --> 01:18:15,610
I'm just living.

1121
01:18:16,170 --> 01:18:16,510
I'm just living.

1122
01:18:16,730 --> 01:18:17,230
They're off.

1123
01:18:17,390 --> 01:18:17,870
They're off.

1124
01:18:18,490 --> 01:18:18,850
They're off.

1125
01:18:23,850 --> 01:18:24,350
Rocker 100.

1126
01:18:25,270 --> 01:18:26,170
Rocker real one.

1127
01:18:26,190 --> 01:18:26,690
Micah, I'm fine.

1128
01:18:26,830 --> 01:18:27,870
Rocha, heck okay.

1129
01:18:27,870 --> 01:18:28,070
Just hit.

1130
01:18:29,810 --> 01:18:31,690
Just hit, just hit, just hit.

1131
01:18:32,110 --> 01:18:34,610
I shoot a Hawkeye, 2, 1.

1132
01:18:34,950 --> 01:18:36,090
Hawkeye, it's out, feel.

1133
01:18:36,190 --> 01:18:39,790
Hawkeye, Hawkeye right, Hawkeye, Hawkeye, hotter right.

1134
01:18:39,970 --> 01:18:40,670
I'm chilling.

1135
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:43,330
Get them a headshot.

1136
01:18:43,450 --> 01:18:43,830
Get a headshot.

1137
01:18:43,910 --> 01:18:44,930
I'm back, I'm back, I'm back.

1138
01:18:45,130 --> 01:18:45,830
I got you.

1139
01:18:46,030 --> 01:18:46,950
I go grab someone, ready?

1140
01:18:47,410 --> 01:18:49,150
Three, two, one.

1141
01:18:49,310 --> 01:18:50,150
I should good for next Yes.

1142
01:18:51,350 --> 01:18:53,090
One on against one.

1143
01:18:53,530 --> 01:18:53,830
Yeah.

1144
01:18:53,830 --> 01:18:56,170
Two, one.

1145
01:18:56,590 --> 01:18:58,130
I'm not with you, no, it's just me.

1146
01:18:58,270 --> 01:18:58,950
I can't.

1147
01:19:00,610 --> 01:19:01,330
I'm glad it's Tor.

1148
01:19:01,710 --> 01:19:04,970
No, no rest.

1149
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:06,710
We're close to defensive holds.

1150
01:19:06,810 --> 01:19:07,470
I'm dead.

1151
01:19:08,390 --> 01:19:08,550
I'm dead.

1152
01:19:09,730 --> 01:19:10,390
Okay, one.

1153
01:19:10,950 --> 01:19:13,210
Point, point, point, point, point, point.

1154
01:19:13,870 --> 01:19:14,790
I can't, I can't.

1155
01:19:14,810 --> 01:19:15,570
Go next fight.

1156
01:19:16,070 --> 01:19:16,830
I'm just living by them.

1157
01:19:17,050 --> 01:19:17,910
I tried to shield.

1158
01:19:18,110 --> 01:19:18,490
I tried to shield.

1159
01:19:18,790 --> 01:19:19,770
Can I go Tor here?

1160
01:19:20,010 --> 01:19:20,690
Low key, Tophie.

1161
01:19:20,810 --> 01:19:21,510
After my health.

1162
01:19:23,830 --> 01:19:24,410
Can you lift?

1163
01:19:24,650 --> 01:19:24,950
I'm behind them.

1164
01:19:25,070 --> 01:19:25,530
Just lift.

1165
01:19:25,790 --> 01:19:26,530
Yep, yep, yep.

1166
01:19:26,770 --> 01:19:28,090
Yeah, I'm good.

1167
01:19:28,230 --> 01:19:29,570
I can go rocket whenever.

1168
01:19:30,330 --> 01:19:30,790
Yeah, wait a minute.

1169
01:19:30,790 --> 01:19:31,330
Better go.

1170
01:19:31,390 --> 01:19:31,610
Better go.

1171
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:32,170
Better go.

1172
01:19:32,170 --> 01:19:32,350
Ready?

1173
01:19:34,010 --> 01:19:34,230
We're going.

1174
01:19:34,670 --> 01:19:35,190
I'm going.

1175
01:19:35,290 --> 01:19:35,930
Not going.

1176
01:19:35,930 --> 01:19:38,990
Rocket one.

1177
01:19:39,110 --> 01:19:39,590
Rocket one.

1178
01:19:39,590 --> 01:19:40,030
Rocket one.

1179
01:19:40,470 --> 01:19:40,650
I can't.

1180
01:19:40,850 --> 01:19:41,850
I'm playing slow.

1181
01:19:43,430 --> 01:19:43,650
I'm playing slow.

1182
01:19:43,690 --> 01:19:44,250
I need hiding.

1183
01:19:45,070 --> 01:19:45,830
Oh, my God.

1184
01:19:48,150 --> 01:19:49,310
I couldn't react in time.

1185
01:19:50,090 --> 01:19:50,770
Can't break.

1186
01:19:51,090 --> 01:19:51,270
Can't break.

1187
01:19:52,090 --> 01:19:53,050
Go back.

1188
01:19:54,770 --> 01:19:56,090
I can get the old moxie.

1189
01:19:56,230 --> 01:19:57,530
Just chill, just chill.

1190
01:19:57,890 --> 01:19:59,190
And they use...

1191
01:19:59,190 --> 01:19:59,810
Go group up.

1192
01:19:59,870 --> 01:20:00,550
Rocket off, rocket off guys.

1193
01:20:00,570 --> 01:20:02,290
You should try to swap to rocket after.

1194
01:20:03,970 --> 01:20:05,370
Okay, I'm set up on the model then.

1195
01:20:06,750 --> 01:20:07,210
No, no, no, no.

1196
01:20:07,270 --> 01:20:07,790
After all, after all.

1197
01:20:08,550 --> 01:20:09,270
Because I'm quotes.

1198
01:20:09,590 --> 01:20:10,890
Might go back on DDO, whatever.

1199
01:20:11,150 --> 01:20:12,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, wait, wait, wait.

1200
01:20:12,450 --> 01:20:13,450
I'm gonna use my...

1201
01:20:13,450 --> 01:20:14,370
There's a Tor mark here.

1202
01:20:14,370 --> 01:20:14,990
There's a Tor mark here.

1203
01:20:15,190 --> 01:20:15,970
There's a Tor mark.

1204
01:20:16,070 --> 01:20:16,750
I'll go in the corner.

1205
01:20:16,990 --> 01:20:18,030
I'll kill me too, actually.

1206
01:20:18,510 --> 01:20:19,650
This is a super ace.

1207
01:20:20,050 --> 01:20:20,470
Because you want to go?

1208
01:20:20,550 --> 01:20:20,790
You want to go?

1209
01:20:20,970 --> 01:20:21,630
I'm just dead.

1210
01:20:21,770 --> 01:20:22,410
I'm just dead.

1211
01:20:23,830 --> 01:20:25,110
I can't even do anything against him.

1212
01:20:25,110 --> 01:20:25,330
Am I going?

1213
01:20:25,850 --> 01:20:26,270
I'm killing.

1214
01:20:26,690 --> 01:20:27,130
Come on, come on.

1215
01:20:27,170 --> 01:20:28,730
Come on.

1216
01:20:28,870 --> 01:20:29,210
No.

1217
01:20:29,210 --> 01:20:29,490
I'm spamming it.

1218
01:20:30,370 --> 01:20:30,830
Can your ult?

1219
01:20:30,850 --> 01:20:31,170
Can you ult?

1220
01:20:31,550 --> 01:20:32,150
Yeah, I can.

1221
01:20:32,510 --> 01:20:32,650
I can.

1222
01:20:33,050 --> 01:20:33,430
I can.

1223
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:37,590
I'm trying to get...

1224
01:20:37,590 --> 01:20:37,950
No!

1225
01:20:38,990 --> 01:20:39,850
I'm just trying.

1226
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:42,310
I'm trying to leave.

1227
01:20:42,330 --> 01:20:43,250
Three cells, one.

1228
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:44,290
Three cells, three cells, three, three.

1229
01:20:44,290 --> 01:20:45,390
That's fine.

1230
01:20:46,090 --> 01:20:46,290
I'm over.

1231
01:20:46,630 --> 01:20:46,830
Angel low.

1232
01:20:47,050 --> 01:20:47,530
Maybe we would have lucky.

1233
01:20:48,050 --> 01:20:48,530
There we are.

1234
01:20:48,530 --> 01:20:48,970
Angel lift.

1235
01:20:49,810 --> 01:20:50,190
Angel lift.

1236
01:20:50,270 --> 01:20:50,610
Huck I want.

1237
01:20:51,450 --> 01:20:52,130
I hit him too.

1238
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:53,090
One.

1239
01:20:54,130 --> 01:20:55,190
I see where my Twitch.

1240
01:20:55,190 --> 01:20:56,130
Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac.

1241
01:20:58,410 --> 01:20:58,990
He has to hold.

1242
01:20:59,130 --> 01:20:59,490
He has to hold.

1243
01:20:59,870 --> 01:21:00,430
He's off the map.

1244
01:21:00,910 --> 01:21:01,770
Ah, we got Backland.

1245
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:02,710
Backland hit.

1246
01:21:03,050 --> 01:21:04,290
All hit, all hit.

1247
01:21:06,310 --> 01:21:07,310
I'm on Liran.

1248
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:08,070
Only Rocket, only Rocket.

1249
01:21:08,310 --> 01:21:08,310
Only Rocket support.

1250
01:21:08,490 --> 01:21:08,970
Only Rocket support.

1251
01:21:09,250 --> 01:21:09,790
Come on, I'm on.

1252
01:21:11,410 --> 01:21:14,170
Yeah, I'm on it.

1253
01:21:14,630 --> 01:21:16,550
You'll have to keep fighting until we have a winner.

1254
01:21:17,530 --> 01:21:18,630
I'm back with Holt in five seconds.

1255
01:21:18,770 --> 01:21:19,610
Rocket one, rocket one, rocket one.

1256
01:21:19,850 --> 01:21:21,770
I can't even point, I'm on point.

1257
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:22,750
But the rocket's on me.

1258
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:34,910
or not rocket thores on me it's okay do these like moving
walls like had had we have like no angles pretty useless

1259
01:21:34,910 --> 01:21:45,690
though I don't even know mag with our mag I think we go full
dive I think we go underline I go cap I actually think that

1260
01:21:46,290 --> 01:21:54,890
I think we need to go Jeffy I will we need like some damage
on the backline anyone Any additional damage there kills

1261
01:21:54,890 --> 01:21:55,430
them, by the way.

1262
01:21:55,630 --> 01:21:57,390
We just take map control and we just take it.

1263
01:21:57,710 --> 01:22:02,670
Think of Phoenix, Moxie, or Starlord, or Ciloc, or anything
that can shoot the enemy.

1264
01:22:03,630 --> 01:22:04,970
Yeah, just shoot them.

1265
01:22:05,010 --> 01:22:05,710
Not Spider-Man.

1266
01:22:06,110 --> 01:22:06,670
Destroy Rocket.

1267
01:22:07,090 --> 01:22:07,750
No, no, it's fine.

1268
01:22:07,830 --> 01:22:07,990
It's fine.

1269
01:22:08,110 --> 01:22:08,830
This matchup is good.

1270
01:22:08,950 --> 01:22:09,530
This matchup is good.

1271
01:22:10,070 --> 01:22:13,490
I don't know how I could dodge that hot guy.

1272
01:22:13,730 --> 01:22:18,530
I, like, I like save, try to save ult, too, and then he
still killed me.

1273
01:22:18,910 --> 01:22:19,830
Go this.

1274
01:22:20,110 --> 01:22:20,770
I think Phoenix is good.

1275
01:22:20,910 --> 01:22:21,770
I think this is definitely better.

1276
01:22:22,750 --> 01:22:23,750
We have to play this.

1277
01:22:26,490 --> 01:22:27,170
Go away.

1278
01:22:27,610 --> 01:22:28,510
I go around.

1279
01:22:29,330 --> 01:22:29,950
I can scout.

1280
01:22:30,270 --> 01:22:30,880
What ulcer do they have?

1281
01:22:32,850 --> 01:22:34,410
They probably have...

1282
01:22:34,410 --> 01:22:35,670
They probably have rock floor, yeah.

1283
01:22:35,670 --> 01:22:35,890
They have full.

1284
01:22:35,990 --> 01:22:36,370
They have Luna.

1285
01:22:36,470 --> 01:22:36,990
Luna and main.

1286
01:22:37,770 --> 01:22:38,610
I can develop for the Luna.

1287
01:22:39,530 --> 01:22:41,130
Ignore everyone and just go for Luna, okay?

1288
01:22:41,750 --> 01:22:42,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1289
01:22:42,310 --> 01:22:42,950
I hit background soon.

1290
01:22:43,090 --> 01:22:43,370
I can go.

1291
01:22:43,430 --> 01:22:43,710
I can go.

1292
01:22:44,190 --> 01:22:44,390
Nora's beacon.

1293
01:22:44,590 --> 01:22:44,910
Nora's beacon.

1294
01:22:45,050 --> 01:22:45,310
You want to go?

1295
01:22:45,690 --> 01:22:45,790
You want to go?

1296
01:22:45,970 --> 01:22:46,350
You want to go.

1297
01:22:46,470 --> 01:22:49,070
Can you lift?

1298
01:22:50,110 --> 01:22:50,970
Can you lift?

1299
01:22:51,210 --> 01:22:51,950
They're all going up.

1300
01:22:52,930 --> 01:22:53,830
Yeah, I'm chilling.

1301
01:22:54,370 --> 01:22:55,030
I'm better going.

1302
01:22:55,130 --> 01:22:55,290
I'm better going.

1303
01:22:55,510 --> 01:22:55,990
I'm dead.

1304
01:22:56,210 --> 01:22:56,530
Aren't they all dead?

1305
01:22:58,270 --> 01:22:59,410
We have a rez.

1306
01:22:59,910 --> 01:23:00,590
He's on point alone.

1307
01:23:00,650 --> 01:23:01,290
Good one, good one, good one.

1308
01:23:02,190 --> 01:23:02,930
Need to lift, need to lift.

1309
01:23:03,210 --> 01:23:04,230
Go next right, go next right.

1310
01:23:04,350 --> 01:23:04,590
Alright.

1311
01:23:05,570 --> 01:23:06,010
It's a good action.

1312
01:23:06,830 --> 01:23:07,830
Go next, go next right.

1313
01:23:09,830 --> 01:23:13,010
Can we kill the...

1314
01:23:13,010 --> 01:23:15,950
Oh, shit, too.

1315
01:23:16,190 --> 01:23:19,170
And two, three, two, three, two, two, two, three, and two,
one.

1316
01:23:19,410 --> 01:23:19,870
Just wait.

1317
01:23:21,710 --> 01:23:22,330
Oh, ho, ho.

1318
01:23:23,190 --> 01:23:23,550
Rocket.

1319
01:23:24,170 --> 01:23:25,070
Rocket, okay.

1320
01:23:26,110 --> 01:23:26,670
Yeah, yeah.

1321
01:23:26,670 --> 01:23:27,050
Need to wait.

1322
01:23:27,410 --> 01:23:28,370
I can hit them soon.

1323
01:23:29,290 --> 01:23:30,330
I'm looking for a beacon again.

1324
01:23:31,550 --> 01:23:31,910
Yeah.

1325
01:23:32,330 --> 01:23:32,810
I go around.

1326
01:23:32,970 --> 01:23:33,330
I go top.

1327
01:23:35,270 --> 01:23:35,810
They're in main.

1328
01:23:36,350 --> 01:23:36,870
They're all in main.

1329
01:23:37,570 --> 01:23:38,210
They're all in main.

1330
01:23:38,650 --> 01:23:39,250
I can hit them.

1331
01:23:39,410 --> 01:23:39,990

You should have a hard time stopping our development.

01:24:29,270 --> 01:24:30,030
Just play slow in main.

1369
01:24:30,130 --> 01:24:31,870
You just have two people in main and just play slow.

1370
01:24:32,410 --> 01:24:33,290
Don't need hard development.

1371

The path thing, like the cloacal, the only goal is to kill
you there, Doki.

1510
01:27:30,450 --> 01:27:31,090
You should play to lift.

1511
01:27:31,630 --> 01:27:33,590
Go on the wall, go high and try to lift.

1512
01:27:33,990 --> 01:27:35,630
I think the map like fucked their cloacal.

1513
01:27:35,730 --> 01:27:36,410
I didn't even see it.

1514
01:27:36,610 --> 01:27:37,190
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1515
01:27:37,230 --> 01:27:37,850
They were so bad.

1516
01:27:37,970 --> 01:27:38,690
They were so far away.

1517
01:27:43,230 --> 01:27:44,490
Oh my god.

1518
01:27:45,350 --> 01:27:46,310
This is hell.

1519
01:27:46,910 --> 01:27:48,870
There are like mutual fights that we need to look over.

1520
01:27:48,970 --> 01:27:50,730
The definitely first fight was kind of cooked.

1521
01:27:50,730 --> 01:27:56,530
We need one guy in main that just hours from the rocket We
need all of the rocket to be able to play in main so we get

1522
01:27:56,530 --> 01:28:02,070
the peers to push their back line and our Angela should also
play Toward main because you want to play to scoop only me

1523
01:28:02,070 --> 01:28:09,050
Jeff and should I just be shooting out the Angela like the
whole game For sure you just need to dish out damage so you

1524
01:28:09,050 --> 01:28:20,930
create opportunity I think I think I hate that I think I
hate it I don't know I think I saw you guys dive in the I

1525
01:28:20,930 --> 01:28:22,090
think I hate dive

1526
01:28:25,970 --> 01:28:37,670
That's pretty I mean dive is great for people who kid dab
but Bro, I hate dive Bro, he just goes four Yeah, I was on I

1527
01:28:37,670 --> 01:28:39,510
was on like three different roles.

1528
01:28:39,670 --> 01:28:46,490
He was on yeah, they started Jeff and then went Guys, I
think dive is fun I don't know.

1529
01:28:46,630 --> 01:28:47,770
It's just a crazy theory.

1530
01:28:47,790 --> 01:28:48,370
It's kind of crazy.

1531
01:28:48,510 --> 01:28:53,550
The door's pretty good into our comp spoken like a true NA
player.

1532
01:28:55,290 --> 01:28:58,630
Me and name, me one bra, me one unga bunga.

1533
01:28:59,630 --> 01:29:02,230
Me one safety from my tanks.

1534
01:29:05,850 --> 01:29:10,510
Me, me, me one safety and sit in back and go ha ha here.

1535
01:29:10,710 --> 01:29:12,990

01:29:13,010 --> 01:29:13,990
Me and name, me no thing.

1537
01:29:14,010 --> 01:29:14,590
I think so too.

1538
01:29:15,950 --> 01:29:18,770
I think he uses me for the kind of stuff you felt and then
uses like...

1539
01:29:18,770 --> 01:29:19,690
Yeah, I think so too.

1540

it yeah

1542
01:29:40,070 --> 01:29:48,990

game and poke is just boring it may be boring but i get to

1543

spider-man here yeah because i played with you in the rank
game yeah but then then speed like one it was like half a

1547

the air he's good enough bro said decent bro you know what

1548
01:30:34,690 --> 01:30:41,070

1557
01:31:43,270 --> 01:31:44,590
It doesn't mean nothing.

1558
01:31:46,150 --> 01:31:47,650
That hero is Thanos.

1559
01:31:48,030 --> 01:31:49,030
That hero is Thanos.

1560
01:31:49,090 --> 01:31:49,530
Yeah.

1561
01:31:49,710 --> 01:31:50,150
Okay.

1562
01:31:50,250 --> 01:31:52,030
Loki, can you play Loki or something?

1563
01:31:52,430 --> 01:31:52,850
Are there one of them?

1564
01:31:52,970 --> 01:31:53,030

01:31:54,010 --> 01:31:56,270
Okay, I'll go.

1567
01:31:57,410 --> 01:31:58,490
Where are you from, Vinny?

1568
01:31:58,590 --> 01:31:59,550
You're actually so fake.

1569
01:31:59,930 --> 01:32:00,430
It's actually fake.

1570
01:32:00,710 --> 01:32:02,850
Wait, do you think so fake?

1571
01:32:03,210 --> 01:32:03,630
It is so fake.

1572
01:32:03,630 --> 01:32:04,470
It is so fake.

1573
01:32:04,650 --> 01:32:04,670
It is so fake, you know?

1574
01:32:05,070 --> 01:32:06,110
I was thinking the same thing.

1575
01:32:06,970 --> 01:32:07,710
It's insane.

1576
01:32:08,090 --> 01:32:08,190
It's insane.

1577
01:32:08,190 --> 01:32:08,550
Wait, where?

1578
01:32:09,150 --> 01:32:09,950
I'm Spanish.

1579
01:32:10,810 --> 01:32:11,250
Spanish.

1580
01:32:11,250 --> 01:32:13,110
Are you from Spain?

1581
01:32:14,110 --> 01:32:15,470
No, no me hablo espanol.

1582
01:32:17,370 --> 01:32:20,030
I told you he's so fucking German.

1583
01:32:20,590 --> 01:32:21,070
Bro, where are you from?

1584
01:32:21,330 --> 01:32:22,990
You sound like you don't exist.

1585
01:32:23,670 --> 01:32:25,370
That's the thing I learned in class.

1586
01:32:26,090 --> 01:32:26,570
That's crazy.

1587
01:32:26,570 --> 01:32:29,030
I did like four years of German and I don't remember
anything.

1588
01:32:29,630 --> 01:32:30,190
Yeah, it's funny.

1589
01:32:32,010 --> 01:32:33,390
You don't sound real.

1590
01:32:33,730 --> 01:32:35,070
I'm sure everyone's gonna have AI anyway.

1591
01:32:35,670 --> 01:32:37,570
Yeah, I'm kind of like hard German to be honest.

1592
01:32:38,090 --> 01:32:38,410
But yeah.

1593
01:32:38,530 --> 01:32:40,450
I need to, and Phoenix here again, no?

1594
01:32:41,250 --> 01:32:48,670
come down a little bit all right i came if i lowered their
volume a little more hawkeye moxie they both buy phoenix

1595
01:32:48,670 --> 01:33:00,330
just saying guys i saved jeff again by the way i'll go i
need to because we we gotta hope they don't ban fucking

1596
01:33:00,330 --> 01:33:09,330
hawkeye there's no way we can they have melio his hawkeye's
crazy too what else can we ban I mean, Invis again?

1597
01:33:10,170 --> 01:33:10,930
I think Invis is good.

1598
01:33:11,130 --> 01:33:13,230
I think it's either Invis or Namur probably.

1599
01:33:14,110 --> 01:33:16,330
No, I think let them name or it's not that good.

1600
01:33:16,830 --> 01:33:18,050
Maybe on that map actually.

1601
01:33:19,510 --> 01:33:20,990
Yeah, Invis is good.

1602
01:33:21,130 --> 01:33:22,050
Invis is good, Ben, I think.

1603
01:33:22,590 --> 01:33:23,430
I think I like this.

1604
01:33:23,710 --> 01:33:24,230
I actually like this.

1605
01:33:24,230 --> 01:33:25,070
I mean, that's fine too.

1606
01:33:25,850 --> 01:33:27,610
I think this is very hard for them to play now.

1607
01:33:27,790 --> 01:33:30,910
They're gonna go Invis though, but I think for us...

1608
01:33:30,910 --> 01:33:31,450
I'll be on Invis Loki.

1609
01:33:32,950 --> 01:33:34,310
For us, I want Jeff.

1610
01:33:35,430 --> 01:33:36,090
I need Jeff.

1611
01:33:38,450 --> 01:33:44,810
because they can ban any tank in the game we can still play
the game so it's like we're quite flexible can say the same

1612
01:33:44,810 --> 01:33:49,790
about the enemy whoa you don't think they're flexible

1613
01:33:53,030 --> 01:34:04,790
shots who is the most unflexible player on that team oh yeah
trust me yeah call them out besides them raider i mean this

1614
01:34:04,790 --> 01:34:11,710
is the situation no we have angela and venom know questions
who wants to play what i mean we could also play deadpool

1615
01:34:11,710 --> 01:34:20,790
with venom i think that i want to try that with venom was op
i think so yeah i think it's strong i think i just pushed

1616
01:34:20,790 --> 01:34:27,230
backland and we just kill them all they don't they have
inverse loki most likely yeah i think so i think if we get

1617
01:34:27,230 --> 01:34:36,530
jeff set up then it's very hard for them to defend it
question is what does moxie go spider-man i can you can hawk

1618
01:34:36,530 --> 01:34:44,530
i feel like hawk is just i hockey snooky like you cannot
play it i think it's rocket chef again yeah i think okay or

1619
01:34:44,530 --> 01:34:49,890
spider-man we could go we could go where you go spider-man i
believe in his spider-man i definitely

1620
01:34:55,050 --> 01:35:00,710
okay okay do one life one life definitely you want to play
triple tank triple support okay every character open that

1621
01:35:00,710 --> 01:35:07,870
makes it good uh do you want me to use the double team ups
when you dive or you just use it for myself yeah we can use

1622
01:35:07,870 --> 01:35:12,910
it in the enemy backline if you want but you should use it
for yourself and for uh hawkeye maybe like it depends on

1623
01:35:12,910 --> 01:35:20,250
where you are it's quick they have three i think they're
they have like phoenix loki they're gonna have triple tank

1624
01:35:20,250 --> 01:35:31,150
at them i think i can go go around i can't go around okay
i'm looking i'm looking up one adam adam adam adam adam one

1625
01:35:31,150 --> 01:35:34,470
come on loki my loki uh am i Okay, let's farm.

1626
01:35:34,650 --> 01:35:34,790
Go back.

1627
01:35:35,070 --> 01:35:36,470
Oh, I got one shot.

1628
01:35:36,910 --> 01:35:37,030
Yeah.

1629
01:35:37,190 --> 01:35:37,950
And we're pushing fine.

1630
01:35:38,930 --> 01:35:39,570
I can go again.

1631
01:35:39,650 --> 01:35:39,950
Oh, I'm dead.

1632
01:35:41,170 --> 01:35:43,790
I'm throwing my orbs out.

1633
01:35:43,890 --> 01:35:44,930
They have triple tank, triple support.

1634
01:35:45,090 --> 01:35:45,730
We need to swap.

1635
01:35:46,290 --> 01:35:46,890
Yeah, you need to swap.

1636
01:35:47,010 --> 01:35:47,170
Yeah, you need to swap Moxie.

1637
01:35:47,310 --> 01:35:47,690
You need swap.

1638
01:35:48,330 --> 01:35:49,030
Swap to Bucky?

1639
01:35:49,450 --> 01:35:49,770
Spiderman?

1640
01:35:50,450 --> 01:35:51,770
I think Wolf actually.

1641
01:35:51,870 --> 01:35:52,210
I think Wolf.

1642
01:35:52,670 --> 01:35:52,810
Wolf.

1643
01:35:53,810 --> 01:35:53,830
Wolf.

1644
01:35:53,830 --> 01:35:54,590
Play to punish, play to punish.

1645
01:35:54,610 --> 01:35:55,610
I can go back then again.

1646
01:35:55,750 --> 01:35:56,650
I don't think they have lamps yet.

1647
01:35:57,270 --> 01:35:57,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1648
01:35:57,730 --> 01:35:57,850

Kill a man.

1654
01:36:04,870 --> 01:36:05,670
We play two lives, play to hit.

1655
01:36:05,670 --> 01:36:06,490
We low they are going.

1656
01:36:06,630 --> 01:36:07,470

1659
01:36:10,730 --> 01:36:12,030
We have one on there too much.

1660
01:36:12,750 --> 01:36:15,890
We played to lift, played to hit, played to hit.

1661
01:36:15,930 --> 01:36:16,510
Artim 1, out of 1.

1662
01:36:18,350 --> 01:36:19,550
They're down, they're down to support.

1663
01:36:19,670 --> 01:36:20,390
No, Ray, Z is gonna risk.

1664
01:36:20,530 --> 01:36:21,190
They only have atom kills.

1665
01:36:22,810 --> 01:36:23,530
All right, all.

1858
01:40:48,730 --> 01:40:49,770
You're back here.

1859
01:40:49,790 --> 01:40:50,190
We need you alive.

1860
01:40:50,570 --> 01:40:51,150
I'm on Ibis.

1861
01:40:51,190 --> 01:40:51,530
I'm on Ibis.

1862
01:40:57,530 --> 01:40:59,450

In this one, in this one.

1867
01:41:02,770 --> 01:41:04,750
Is anyone's lagging or just me?

1868
01:41:04,850 --> 01:41:05,950
Just you.

1869
01:41:06,390 --> 01:41:08,250
Instead of lagging, I guess it's me.

1870
01:41:08,350 --> 01:41:09,870
Too many cooldowns in the back then.

1871
01:41:10,650 --> 01:41:11,330
They have Bucky now.

1872
01:41:11,630 --> 01:41:12,190

1873
01:41:12,190 --> 01:41:12,870
Yeah, fresh Bucky.

01:41:15,030 --> 01:41:15,450

1876
01:41:15,990 --> 01:41:16,870
It should be fine.

1877

You want to go early?

I'll stay on card.

1884
01:41:25,230 --> 01:41:25,670
You should raise.

1885
01:41:25,970 --> 01:41:26,330
You should keep it.

1886
01:41:27,730 --> 01:41:28,690

Angela's on point.

1891
01:41:35,730 --> 01:41:37,090
Don't die.

1892
01:41:37,230 --> 01:41:37,330

1999
01:44:23,490 --> 01:44:24,410
You just need more resistance.

2000
01:44:24,690 --> 01:44:27,710
You need to hit the enemy tanks that are on points.

2001
01:44:28,190 --> 01:44:28,550
What is that?

2002
01:44:28,770 --> 01:44:30,030
What does the most damage on points?

Wolf one, wolf one.

2220
01:50:44,250 --> 01:50:44,430
Wolf one.

2221
01:50:44,630 --> 01:50:44,650
Wolf one.

2222
01:50:44,650 --> 01:50:44,910
I'm grabbed.

2223
01:50:46,010 --> 01:50:46,550
Oh, I'm robbed.

2224
01:50:47,130 --> 01:50:47,410
It's over.

2225
01:50:47,410 --> 01:50:47,650
Nice.

2226
01:50:48,150 --> 01:50:48,210
Nice.

2227
01:50:49,410 --> 01:50:49,830
Let's go.

2228
01:50:50,730 --> 01:50:51,210
DJs.

2229
01:50:52,170 --> 01:50:52,590
Told you, bro.

2230
01:50:54,950 --> 01:50:55,910
Safety first.

2231
01:50:56,710 --> 01:50:57,430
You're strong.

2232
01:50:57,870 --> 01:50:58,710
Yes, you're so close.

2233
01:50:59,210 --> 01:51:00,970
Another epic victory.

2234
01:51:01,390 --> 01:51:02,310
Big win.

2235
01:51:02,870 --> 01:51:03,250
Oh my god.

2236
01:51:03,410 --> 01:51:04,710
Is this what winning feels like?

2237
01:51:05,630 --> 01:51:06,390
Oh my god.

2238
01:51:07,530 --> 01:51:09,010
Someone said duck needs lessons.

2239
01:51:09,710 --> 01:51:10,450
Oh my god.

2240
01:51:13,590 --> 01:51:35,190
I'm literally like brain off just just rocket brain off
right click brain off shoot gun right click brain pray chuck

2241
01:51:35,190 --> 01:51:43,790

gifted shares.

2242
01:51:44,030 --> 01:51:44,070
Thank you.

2243
01:51:44,490 --> 01:51:44,850
Thank you.

2244
01:51:45,650 --> 01:51:46,690
We're playing next.

2245
01:51:47,050 --> 01:51:47,550
Guys, please.

2246
01:51:47,990 --> 01:51:48,030
Cap.

2247
01:51:49,310 --> 01:51:50,070
Cap and Venom.

2248
01:51:50,670 --> 01:51:51,470
Playing Kovacs.

2249
01:51:53,270 --> 01:51:54,790
Bro, am I not a...

2250
01:51:55,310 --> 01:51:56,850
That's crazy that I'm only known for that.

2251
01:51:56,930 --> 01:51:57,950
I used to be a Mac player.

2252
01:52:02,410 --> 01:52:03,450
I guess not anymore though.

2253
01:52:04,550 --> 01:52:04,970
Yeah, what are...

2254
01:52:04,970 --> 01:52:06,510
You're now a Deadpool player.

2255
01:52:08,050 --> 01:52:09,650
True, but you need to aim on that hero too.

2256
01:52:10,510 --> 01:52:13,590
Oh, yeah, I'm just...

2257
01:52:13,610 --> 01:52:14,910
I'm just a shadow.

2258
01:52:15,130 --> 01:52:16,050
I'm like the puppet.

2259
01:52:17,030 --> 01:52:17,230
Trust me.

2260
01:52:17,310 --> 01:52:20,030
It's the one controlling me.

2261
01:52:21,070 --> 01:52:22,650
I'm just a puppet leader.

2262
01:52:23,590 --> 01:52:24,950
The rest of my team is the Illuminati.

2263
01:52:27,890 --> 01:52:31,670
I literally exist to be like the pretty face of the team.

2264
01:52:32,430 --> 01:52:33,830
To be the woman of the team.

2265
01:52:35,670 --> 01:52:37,390
Trust me, it's the Illuminati.

2266
01:52:37,770 --> 01:52:38,570
I'm the president.

2267
01:52:43,610 --> 01:52:46,370
We will start banning Jeff, I think.

2268
01:52:46,570 --> 01:52:47,550
Yeah, I think so too.

2269
01:52:47,810 --> 01:52:50,630
The timers have the timers in the eye again.

2270
01:53:05,950 --> 01:53:10,170
I probably have to watch what happened on the third point.

2271
01:53:10,610 --> 01:53:12,550
We need to have better target prior there.

2272
01:53:13,610 --> 01:53:20,190
they can stall the point forever they had zero support sub
we need to have better target pro it took five minutes to

2273
01:53:20,190 --> 01:53:28,110
kill the personal point i think it was angela touching oh i
know like the psy was like shooting uh whiny and me on the

2274
01:53:28,110 --> 01:53:33,270
side the entire time it was like one inch field then because
i think this is the tournament if there's a solo psy lock

2275
01:53:33,270 --> 01:53:39,310
and we have very mobile all we need to do is just three men
walk into the guy and he just always has to give space and

2276
01:53:39,310 --> 01:53:44,930
then he can never set up late you know so we need to
properly push him more of the especially when we have mobile

2277
01:53:44,930 --> 01:53:51,650
characters if we have slow characters then we need to play
to hit survive the hit but um if we have this characters we

2278
01:53:51,650 --> 01:54:04,470
need to walk into a more apparently i see captain beat sk's
team and wait there's a third map i thought it was like best

2279
01:54:04,470 --> 01:54:11,450
did you no it's just best of three yeah it's ggs already
flats and terrors still playing wait let us know when we're

2280
01:54:11,450 --> 01:54:22,390
ready for yeah yeah but they they uh forcing us to the third
map what what do you say oh wait i thought it's best of

2281
01:54:22,390 --> 01:54:35,430
three unless we play the third map unless it's like i guess
like for day two it's high breaker maybe like i don't know

2282
01:54:36,170 --> 01:54:45,570
maybe day two is best as three maybe i would rules wrong i
guess Best of free, but all maps will be played.

2283
01:54:45,630 --> 01:54:46,090
Oh, okay.

2284
01:54:46,470 --> 01:54:47,670
So we have to play this map.

2285
01:54:48,770 --> 01:54:49,110
Okay.

2286
01:54:50,330 --> 01:54:51,430
So it doesn't matter if we lose?

2287
01:54:51,950 --> 01:54:52,370
No, it doesn't.

2288
01:54:52,850 --> 01:54:54,410
It's just to determine the seating.

2289
01:54:55,610 --> 01:54:57,990
So it's like a tiebreaker thing, I think.

2290
01:55:00,010 --> 01:55:08,790
Yeah, I feel like there's every team that's 2-0 or whatever,
3-0, and it'll base on the third map wins as well.

2291
01:55:09,290 --> 01:55:09,650
Yeah.

2292
01:55:12,250 --> 01:55:13,270
All right, are we all here?

2293
01:55:14,210 --> 01:55:16,590
yep okay ready

2294
01:55:22,660 --> 01:55:35,280
I'm just scouting out my opponents right now to see this is
a great spider-man maps defense just saying what is it I

2295
01:55:35,280 --> 01:55:43,340
didn't see oh my god it's a great spider-man defense the
signature trust me go spider-man first point defense try to

2296
01:55:43,340 --> 01:55:51,100
pull someone off jump off the map and come back on venom it
is the signature for that it actually is we need to ban it

2297
01:55:51,100 --> 01:55:59,380
it's also a good it's also a good hawkeye map if if the
hitscans are banned and likely so okay i think maybe mantis

2298
01:55:59,380 --> 01:56:09,500
safe also plaques team beat kg's team uh yeah not surprised
that's team is pretty good i think it's the second best team

2299
01:56:09,500 --> 01:56:16,180
i think cypress team is maybe a little bit better i'm not
sure cypress team is losing too Yeah, I think they're

2300
01:56:16,180 --> 01:56:16,880
losing.

2301
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:17,760
Yeah, the Jade 3 team.

2302
01:56:18,520 --> 01:56:20,220
I mean, Jade 3 team is not bad, no?

2303
01:56:20,480 --> 01:56:21,000
Yeah, it's not bad.

2304
01:56:21,400 --> 01:56:24,040
It's not bad team.

2305
01:56:29,820 --> 01:56:30,440
Phoenix save.

2306
01:56:30,900 --> 01:56:30,900
Interesting.

2307
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:32,720
This is a question now.

2308
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:34,200
This is like an annoying situation.

2309
01:56:34,480 --> 01:56:35,540
Because now we have to take Invis.

2310
01:56:36,640 --> 01:56:37,540
Invis Mantis, I guess.

2311
01:56:38,740 --> 01:56:39,700
Need to try to beat it.

2312
01:56:40,360 --> 01:56:41,520
Definitely have to ban Mantis.

2313
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:43,080
I'm not playing against Phoenix damage boost.

2314
01:56:43,600 --> 01:56:49,600
I don't really mind playing against Invis on, I mean, just
in general.

2315
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:50,240
No, no, no.

2316
01:56:50,300 --> 01:56:50,820
We just ban it.

2317
01:56:50,940 --> 01:56:54,480
We just go Hawkeye now, because they're going to have to
play Loki cloak into.

2318
01:56:54,800 --> 01:56:55,420
Yeah, that works too.

2319
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:57,560
Super 8s.

2320
01:56:58,200 --> 01:56:59,100
Mantis plan is good.

2321
01:56:59,540 --> 01:57:02,060
I like those plans from them, abusing it.

2322
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:04,200
It's not Batman's.

2323
01:57:05,760 --> 01:57:07,720
This might be the Winnie Deadpool situation.

2324
01:57:10,680 --> 01:57:11,880
Maybe we have to first save.

2325
01:57:12,240 --> 01:57:14,480
Maybe we actually have to first save Jeff.

2326
01:57:15,240 --> 01:57:16,020
in the future.

2327
01:57:16,360 --> 01:57:17,640
I want to try it.

2328
01:57:17,680 --> 01:57:19,020
Why don't you play another match?

2329
01:57:19,880 --> 01:57:23,980
Yeah, I know, I know, but like, I feel like Jeff is more
important to the dive than DD.

2330
01:57:24,840 --> 01:57:24,840
Really?

2331
01:57:25,280 --> 01:57:26,680
I think Jeff enables the dive.

2332
01:57:26,680 --> 01:57:33,040
I mean, I think the problem with that is like the second
best dive DPS is like Scythe lock and like that shit is...

2333
01:57:33,040 --> 01:57:36,760
Yeah, I know it's still... Star lore is not like, but like
Daredevil is like... Yeah.

2334
01:57:37,420 --> 01:57:38,360
I could bend this.

2335
01:57:39,620 --> 01:57:40,620
Can we just go Groot, no?

2336
01:57:42,380 --> 01:57:44,140
Do we just go Groot Deadpool, maybe?

2337
01:57:44,600 --> 01:57:44,860
Both?

2338
01:57:45,100 --> 01:57:52,140
can go good if you want i'm thinking i i've never tried it
because rajav doesn't really play good that much i mean he

2339
01:57:52,140 --> 01:58:00,360
does good that's cool i don't think he's i mean actually
maybe something i mean i don't know i don't know the theory

2340
01:58:00,360 --> 01:58:06,240
you play it as a like a disrupt maybe no just like the
annoying i think we go triple though i think we go cloak

2341
01:58:06,240 --> 01:58:07,120
inverse and

2342
01:58:10,340 --> 01:58:19,300
deadpool yeah we can try that oh yeah let's try it with that
250 or do i have more like i think i think you can go hybrid

2343
01:58:19,300 --> 01:58:30,660
like uh that pool and dd oh that's bad haki yeah i have to
like play in super super save i have to play into phoenix

2344
01:58:30,660 --> 01:58:36,220
and he's just gonna have every every fight is just gonna
have phoenix so it's so it's a long time how do we stop it

2345
01:58:36,220 --> 01:58:47,060
though the phoenix still we can't we can't really stop it i
think we just don't give a just gotta cloak shift it to be

2346
01:58:47,060 --> 01:58:58,760
honest oh okay well i'll try i'll try yeah i need to play
group what wait we're confident i think we played dd and

2347
01:58:58,760 --> 01:59:07,700
deadpool no i think so hybrid hybrid though yeah i think so
all right that's fine yeah i think we can go cap two we can

2348
01:59:07,700 --> 01:59:11,500
go cap two yeah yeah yeah

2349
01:59:15,100 --> 01:59:15,560
TD more.

2350
01:59:15,580 --> 01:59:16,920
I can't ever want to do this one.

2351
01:59:17,480 --> 01:59:18,200
Just play this.

2352
01:59:18,300 --> 01:59:18,680
Just play this.

2353
01:59:18,840 --> 01:59:19,040
It's fine.

2354
01:59:19,640 --> 01:59:19,940
Okay.

2355
01:59:20,720 --> 01:59:21,880
Okay, we don't have that many missions.

2356
01:59:22,020 --> 01:59:23,680
If nothing works, we go back full dive.

2357
01:59:23,780 --> 01:59:24,440
We go back full dive.

2358
01:59:24,520 --> 01:59:26,180
They have Angela.

2359
01:59:27,160 --> 01:59:30,620
Yeah, I see a Hela with, like, three low-key clones top
right under Angela there.

2360
01:59:30,660 --> 01:59:31,520
Yeah, okay.

2361
01:59:33,060 --> 01:59:33,920
Yeah, no more top left.

2362
01:59:33,940 --> 01:59:35,080
No more top left for now.

2363
01:59:35,380 --> 01:59:36,760
Yeah, yeah.

2364
01:59:36,760 --> 01:59:37,620
I can contest the blade in.

2365
01:59:37,660 --> 01:59:38,700
I'm going to go with this no more, okay?

2366
01:59:38,980 --> 01:59:38,980
Ready?

2367
01:59:39,440 --> 01:59:40,880
Yeah, I'm going to run.

2368
01:59:42,780 --> 01:59:44,040
One, one, one, one, one, one, one.

2369
01:59:45,100 --> 01:59:46,380
I gave you an orb.

2370
01:59:46,380 --> 01:59:47,160
Kenny, Kenny, Kenny, Kenny.

2371
01:59:49,480 --> 01:59:50,380
They're on top right.

2372
01:59:50,520 --> 01:59:50,980
They're down.

2373
01:59:51,200 --> 01:59:52,040
They're down Loki, by the way.

2374
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:53,480
Oh, I got one.

2375
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:54,380
Hello one.

2376
01:59:54,420 --> 01:59:54,980
Hello on top right.

2377
01:59:55,020 --> 01:59:55,300
Top right.

2378
01:59:55,360 --> 01:59:55,620
He's one.

2379
01:59:55,960 --> 01:59:56,680
He's wearing no heels.

2380
01:59:56,840 --> 01:59:57,060
No heels.

2381
01:59:59,220 --> 01:59:59,980
I'm looking one.

2382
02:00:00,600 --> 02:00:00,680

02:02:00,580 --> 02:02:01,900

2452
02:02:03,700 --> 02:02:04,020

Wait and wait and no, wait and no, wait and no.

2567
02:05:14,180 --> 02:05:15,440
Enjoy me, enjoy me.

2568
02:05:16,480 --> 02:05:17,200
So close.

2569
02:05:17,480 --> 02:05:19,020
All one.

2570
02:05:19,440 --> 02:05:21,020
They're low, they're low, they're low, they're low back.

2571
02:05:21,300 --> 02:05:21,460
I can.

2572
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:21,840
I can.

2573
02:05:22,340 --> 02:05:22,740
I need to hide.

2574
02:05:23,180 --> 02:05:23,540
Need to hide.

2575
02:05:23,680 --> 02:05:23,900
Need to hide.

2576
02:05:23,940 --> 02:05:24,420
Need to hide.

2577
02:05:24,420 --> 02:05:25,180
Just live, just live.

2578
02:05:25,320 --> 02:05:25,500
Just live.

2579
02:05:25,660 --> 02:05:25,800
One more.

2580
02:05:26,280 --> 02:05:26,780
Just live.

2581
02:05:27,800 --> 02:05:29,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2582
02:05:29,040 --> 02:05:29,220
I have mine.

2583
02:05:29,360 --> 02:05:29,680
I have mine.

2584
02:05:30,080 --> 02:05:30,580
Thing one.

2585
02:05:30,680 --> 02:05:31,080
Thing one.

2586
02:05:31,080 --> 02:05:31,580
Thing one.

2587
02:05:33,560 --> 02:05:35,600
Oh my god, bro.

2588
02:05:36,500 --> 02:05:36,980

2590
02:05:37,640 --> 02:05:38,020
I got touch.

2591
02:05:38,300 --> 02:05:38,520
I got touch.

2592
02:05:38,520 --> 02:05:39,620
You need TP by me?

2593
02:05:40,060 --> 02:05:40,880
Yeah, I got it.

2594
02:05:44,100 --> 02:05:44,820

Nice.

2596
02:05:45,220 --> 02:05:46,620
I'm almost out of my own.

2597
02:05:47,200 --> 02:05:47,440
Nice.

2598
02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:48,920
I'm shooting Angel, Angel out.

2599
02:05:50,040 --> 02:05:51,860
I'm shooting Angel out.

2600
02:05:51,860 --> 02:05:52,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2601
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:53,940
I'm gonna get dropped.

2602
02:05:54,440 --> 02:05:55,700
I touch, I touch, I touch, I touch.

2603
02:05:55,700 --> 02:05:57,360
Let me touch, live it, live it, live it, live it, Moxie.

2604
02:05:58,120 --> 02:05:58,240
Yep.

2605
02:05:59,080 --> 02:05:59,640
That'll go with mine.

2606
02:05:59,640 --> 02:05:59,780
That'll go with mine.

2607
02:05:59,900 --> 02:06:00,460
I'm going with mine.

2608
02:06:02,060 --> 02:06:04,600
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.

2609
02:06:04,920 --> 02:06:05,540
Hello, hello, hello.

02:06:05,540 --> 02:06:07,000
Hello, no, no, no, no.

2611
02:06:07,100 --> 02:06:07,500
Hello, no, no, no.

2612
02:06:08,060 --> 02:06:08,680
I got hit.

2613
02:06:08,740 --> 02:06:09,560

2614
02:06:10,140 --> 02:06:10,400

2615
02:06:12,160 --> 02:06:12,700

2616
02:06:12,740 --> 02:06:12,940
I am good.

2617
02:06:12,940 --> 02:06:25,900

you guys one more one more one more that we're done i'm okay

2619
02:06:39,840 --> 02:06:44,120
i'm okay i'm okay I'm on the green tree.

2620
02:06:44,300 --> 02:06:45,000
I'm on the back.

2621
02:06:45,160 --> 02:06:46,060
I'm on the back.

2622
02:06:46,320 --> 02:06:46,940
I'm on the back.

2623
02:06:49,180 --> 02:06:49,660
Hello, one.

2624
02:06:49,700 --> 02:06:50,780
Try to live, try to live, just live, just live.

2625
02:06:52,780 --> 02:06:55,160
Allow them to get infinite glow kills, that's a problem.

2626
02:06:59,170 --> 02:07:00,990
We need to really confirm fights much clearer.

2627
02:07:01,750 --> 02:07:03,510
We can't allow them to farm that many glow kills.

2628
02:07:04,130 --> 02:07:06,150
They're really bad matchup to deny the full dive though.

2629
02:07:06,610 --> 02:07:08,770
Like Loki is very bad into full dive.

2630
02:07:10,530 --> 02:07:13,450
Just need to hit hard and then I just go cap, I think, and
we just win.

2631
02:07:18,710 --> 02:07:24,470
I think I'm getting better at dodging, guys.

2632
02:07:24,850 --> 02:07:25,630
I still hate dive.

2633
02:07:25,870 --> 02:07:26,950
We have to play super smart.

2634
02:07:27,210 --> 02:07:28,830
And we need to dive the angles more.

2635
02:07:29,250 --> 02:07:29,870
I still hate dive.

2636
02:07:30,250 --> 02:07:32,330
I think I'm getting better at dodging.

2637
02:07:33,010 --> 02:07:36,150
You can let me match the death of you or top right.

2638
02:07:38,330 --> 02:07:39,790
That's so fucking sucks.

2639
02:07:41,070 --> 02:07:42,190
I don't know how it's going to be better.

2640
02:07:42,770 --> 02:07:43,330
You're sure?

2641
02:07:44,590 --> 02:07:45,790
Shipper, how can I top right?

2642
02:07:46,830 --> 02:07:47,470
I can play top left.

2643
02:07:47,910 --> 02:07:53,790
I should put my like high ground, but like I'm panicking
too, so I can't really pick and choose where I want to go.

2644
02:07:54,110 --> 02:07:59,290
Because I'm like, like I'm literally hanging by a thread and
I was like, and then I ink.

2645
02:08:00,390 --> 02:08:02,570
Wait, were we on, were we on Deadpool Venom?

2646
02:08:02,910 --> 02:08:08,890
I mean, like, you know, they're like, I'm like, ah, ah, and
then I just chuck it in front of me.

2647
02:08:09,410 --> 02:08:11,830
I can't think to chuck the high ground.

2648
02:08:12,330 --> 02:08:13,970
I mean, this is fine, but we just need to.

2649
02:08:14,590 --> 02:08:21,610
we just really need to hit them hit the people outside of
the healing like if they have cloaky healing have one guy

2650
02:08:21,610 --> 02:08:26,610
shoot the loki clones like moxie just shoot the loki clones
and the rest just hit hit the people outside of the healing

2651
02:08:26,610 --> 02:08:32,890
okay like the hella the namo when they're flanking we can
scout where they go from securing the mission area go

2652
02:08:32,890 --> 02:08:41,010
straight yeah they'll scout they have strange strange i see
angie strange going angie angie going left loki hella left

2653
02:08:41,010 --> 02:08:41,690
Loki hella left.

2654
02:08:41,910 --> 02:08:42,910
There's three left, three right.

2655
02:08:43,830 --> 02:08:44,430
We can all go for them.

2656
02:08:44,530 --> 02:08:46,310
Five left, five left, five left.

2657
02:08:46,630 --> 02:08:46,850
Three, two, one.

2658
02:08:47,350 --> 02:08:47,850
Good man.

2659
02:08:48,450 --> 02:08:49,090
Handula one.

2660
02:08:49,250 --> 02:08:50,050
Slam, slams, slams.

2661
02:08:50,050 --> 02:08:52,470
One, low kill him on, low kill him on, low kill.

2662
02:08:52,690 --> 02:08:53,310
He's checking my balls.

2663
02:08:53,850 --> 02:08:54,110
Whoa!

2664
02:08:54,510 --> 02:08:55,350
I need help, I need help.

2665
02:08:55,430 --> 02:08:55,730

We're up to you.

2669
02:08:58,790 --> 02:08:59,450
We're up to you.

2670
02:08:59,450 --> 02:09:00,050
Go back, go back.

2671
02:09:00,750 --> 02:09:00,970
Match the point.

2672
02:09:01,090 --> 02:09:01,310
Go strange.

2673
02:09:02,350 --> 02:09:02,850
Go strange.

2674
02:09:03,010 --> 02:09:03,230
Go strange.

2675
02:09:03,530 --> 02:09:03,630
Go strange.

2676
02:09:03,750 --> 02:09:04,310
Go strange.

2677
02:09:07,430 --> 02:09:07,950
Wait, kill these.

2678
02:09:08,150 --> 02:09:08,710
Kill these on the right.

2679
02:09:08,710 --> 02:09:10,050
Kill the right, kill the red.

2680
02:09:10,150 --> 02:09:11,750
Wait the dome, wait the dome, wait the dome.

2681

They're back, they're back.

2685
02:09:16,970 --> 02:09:18,510
And, uh, I'm on.

2686

I have the little.

2689
02:09:22,790 --> 02:09:23,710
I can TP.

2690
02:09:24,210 --> 02:09:24,570
I can TP.

We can't shoot it and we can't break it.

2788
02:13:15,350 --> 02:13:15,590
Just lift.

2789
02:13:16,450 --> 02:13:17,050

2798
02:13:24,210 --> 02:13:25,910

Go group.

2804
02:13:29,350 --> 02:13:30,050
They don't have any support.

2805
02:13:30,190 --> 02:13:30,870
They don't have any support.

2806
02:13:30,870 --> 02:13:31,470
I can touch the point.

2807
02:13:31,670 --> 02:13:31,930
I can't go back.

2808
02:13:35,070 --> 02:13:37,050

I'm all here.

2815
02:13:44,190 --> 02:13:44,450
I'm all here.

2816
02:13:44,450 --> 02:13:45,550
Ninja have DLP.

2817
02:13:46,350 --> 02:13:46,990
I lost it.

2818
02:13:47,910 --> 02:13:48,550
Let's go in.

2819
02:13:49,330 --> 02:13:50,210
Get out of there.

2820
02:13:52,810 --> 02:13:53,910
I'm trying to keep you.

2821
02:13:53,910 --> 02:13:54,130
I'm on lucky.

2822
02:13:54,930 --> 02:13:55,490
I'm on lucky.

2823
02:13:55,610 --> 02:13:55,810
I'm on lucky.

2824
02:13:56,870 --> 02:13:57,510
I'm on lucky.

2825
02:13:58,050 --> 02:13:58,450
I'm on lucky.

2826
02:13:58,450 --> 02:13:58,890
I'm trying to keep one.

2827
02:13:59,130 --> 02:13:59,210
Angela.

2828
02:14:00,470 --> 02:14:01,050
I'm tipping.

2829
02:14:01,410 --> 02:14:01,950
I can't touch.

2830
02:14:02,170 --> 02:14:02,550
I can't touch.

2831
02:14:03,110 --> 02:14:03,510
Come on.

2832
02:14:03,910 --> 02:14:04,510
I'm going touch.

2833
02:14:07,350 --> 02:14:08,050
Yeah, it's okay.

2834
02:14:08,710 --> 02:14:09,870
Need to play more to live, guys.

2835
02:14:10,070 --> 02:14:10,950
We're dying too often.

2836
02:14:11,990 --> 02:14:13,170
We hit and then we live.

2837
02:14:13,310 --> 02:14:14,810
We cannot match Glocult, guys.

2838
02:14:15,050 --> 02:14:15,770
I say it all the time.

2839
02:14:16,090 --> 02:14:17,470
They Glocult, we need to get out.

2840
02:14:17,770 --> 02:14:18,670
There's no fighting that.

2841
02:14:19,270 --> 02:14:20,630
We have nothing that can kill through.

2842
02:14:20,770 --> 02:14:21,830
We have nothing that can kill it.

2843
02:14:22,330 --> 02:14:24,030
Just need to respect it and go back, okay?

2844
02:14:25,630 --> 02:14:26,970
Let someone else touch.

2845
02:14:27,170 --> 02:14:27,410
It's fine.

2846
02:14:28,550 --> 02:14:29,530
I can always touch.

2847
02:14:30,010 --> 02:14:30,630
Venom can touch.

2848
02:14:33,730 --> 02:14:34,330
It's okay.

2849
02:14:34,950 --> 02:14:36,030
We understand now.

2850
02:14:36,030 --> 02:14:38,950
They got a bit lucky on the...

2851
02:14:38,950 --> 02:14:40,530
It's like round robin too.

2852
02:14:40,550 --> 02:14:41,410
On the tank.

2853
02:14:41,910 --> 02:14:42,530
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2854
02:14:42,530 --> 02:14:43,890
It's super annoying, the Angela thing.

2855
02:14:44,990 --> 02:14:47,510
I literally can't play the game.

2856
02:14:47,690 --> 02:14:50,490
He's just on me, like, he hasn't hit anyone else except me.

2857
02:14:50,570 --> 02:14:51,630
Is it first to free now?

2858
02:14:51,910 --> 02:14:52,690
No, it's not, right?

2859
02:14:52,890 --> 02:14:53,950
That was just a...

2860
02:14:53,950 --> 02:14:57,270
That was just an extra match for tiebreaker.

2861
02:14:57,490 --> 02:14:58,670
That was like a seeding match, yeah.

2862
02:14:58,890 --> 02:14:59,410
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2863
02:14:59,510 --> 02:15:00,770
It's just a tiebreaker match.

2864
02:15:02,630 --> 02:15:03,230
Yeah, it's fine.

2865
02:15:06,510 --> 02:15:16,090
it's already map two it was three two right did they cap
first the three one they never cap first point right two

2866
02:15:16,090 --> 02:15:26,290
zero map two score i think we yeah we fell hold so it'd be
two zero because we didn't cap third point

2867
02:15:32,940 --> 02:15:46,500
apparently our second room is up now all right let's go as
booger bash one should have probably went hawkaii there

2868
02:15:46,500 --> 02:15:52,780
that's why looking back at it should have played good
hawkaii i think we also i think we also need angie i think

2869
02:15:52,780 --> 02:16:00,160
angie is just so big against a cop like that like hella
phoenix or hell in a more i think so too at least we learned

2870
02:16:00,160 --> 02:16:07,420
from it for for the next time we fight them probably angela
cap and then we just yeah something like that

2871
02:16:11,380 --> 02:16:12,700
this is so boring

2872
02:16:16,380 --> 02:16:22,980
enough charm arrivals i was on doomkey losing i'm one yay i
did it now you're gonna start losing because we lost our

2873
02:16:22,980 --> 02:16:30,480

cloak loki it's also fine to just hit it while you're back

2878
02:17:08,820 --> 02:17:12,740
you're not killing through the lamp we're not killing
through the dome most of the time it's very hard to kill

2879
02:17:12,740 --> 02:17:21,220
through i would rather preserve cooldowns and then hit
future you're talking to me not everyone everyone oh yeah i

2880
02:17:21,220 --> 02:17:28,800
mean i lose a lot of we lose a lot of cooldowns during it so

2883
02:17:43,960 --> 02:17:54,640

world championship back then with naga stand the feet stand

2884
02:17:54,640 --> 02:17:56,420

It's like a fish.

2889
02:18:23,170 --> 02:18:25,670
It's like a fish trying to breathe.

2890
02:18:25,710 --> 02:18:28,670
Oh, yeah.

2891
02:18:28,990 --> 02:18:29,550
Oh, yeah.

Oh, you said the...

2894
02:18:34,450 --> 02:18:35,430
I think it sounds similar.

2895
02:18:35,470 --> 02:18:37,550
I like took me out of the wording.

2896
02:18:39,590 --> 02:18:40,890
We have a unique voice, bro.

Oh, thank you.

2898
02:18:45,510 --> 02:18:46,890

I can invite you whenever.

2904
02:19:06,630 --> 02:19:09,090
They have Gail and J3 DPS.

2905
02:19:11,990 --> 02:19:12,730
R-R-R-R-R-G.

2906
02:19:14,210 --> 02:19:15,850
It's fine they have TTK tank line.

2907
02:19:16,170 --> 02:19:18,270
We just go full dive and we avoid them.

2908
02:19:19,950 --> 02:19:20,130
No?

2909
02:19:20,490 --> 02:19:21,110
I do that.

2910
02:19:21,730 --> 02:19:22,270
Yeah, but we don't.

2911
02:19:23,390 --> 02:19:24,310

mouse guys he said the mouse was really tiny and i was like

2954
02:22:18,610 --> 02:22:30,830

shaming him that's the problem monitor do you have a 240

2955
02:22:30,830 --> 02:22:44,450
yeah 24 no there's no there's no good monitor don't don't
like 27 yeah exactly it's not the size of the mouse it's how

2956
02:22:44,450 --> 02:22:58,180
you use it it's how you grip it right it's how you grip it
it's how you grip it i know that the monitor is on the

2957
02:22:58,180 --> 02:23:00,720
ladder 24 i'm pretty sure so i would rather play on 24.

2958
02:23:07,460 --> 02:23:13,100
yeah but i definitely would need an upgrade i only play 180
hertz right now not even 240.

2959
02:23:13,680 --> 02:23:26,220
jesus wow yeah you need an oled yeah you need the msi oled
monitor legit it has q led and um what hashtag yeah hashtag

and you get like 15 off that's value that's value yeah yeah

2961
02:23:36,180 --> 02:23:47,410

that's true that's a lot 15 off for a thousand dollar

2962
02:23:47,410 --> 02:23:54,450
monitor that's that's like 200 right i don't i'm bad i
failed math yeah that's pretty that's about it kind of like

2963
02:23:54,450 --> 02:24:02,550
150 yeah imagine how much you save might be 150 yeah

2964
02:24:08,480 --> 02:24:18,320
okay that's so natural i'm such a natural show and like I
weaved it into a very natural conversation Craigie and Melio

2965
02:24:20,040 --> 02:24:28,880
I think one of the strongest in tournament I can't lie I
think I think you said every team I can't tell if you're

2966
02:24:28,880 --> 02:24:36,080
being sarcastic yeah you said every team was the strongest
now I don't sure I'm gonna be honest I didn't feel them that

2967
02:24:36,080 --> 02:24:44,720
much but that's just me playing Phoenix you're feeling them
full dive in a hard winning matchup so it should be like

2968
02:24:44,720 --> 02:24:55,300
what team do you think can pull out full dive no no team no
team no one has a jeff player maybe crook's team can if

2969
02:24:55,300 --> 02:25:03,060
let's go maybe i think i think i think fate can they have
team captain and madara oh yeah you're right oh tria i mean

2970
02:25:03,060 --> 02:25:07,500
they yeah they lost to sk's team i mean no no sk lost to
team captain's

2971
02:25:11,320 --> 02:25:23,760
as well like i think they purposely went full depth yeah
they also do our stretch just save spider-man first but we

2972
02:25:23,760 --> 02:25:33,780
have the name our specialist here oh oh yeah me yeah that's
me yeah season zero at the back line for the ice squid in

2973
02:25:33,780 --> 02:25:40,060
the back line at afk they're not that is like the boxy
special against sk's team they weren't playing full dive

2974
02:25:40,060 --> 02:25:47,380
though They went Mag, Phoenix, Invis, Spider-Man, Thor,
Loki.

2975
02:25:48,720 --> 02:25:50,060
Everyone is playing four, I can't.

2976
02:25:50,860 --> 02:25:52,620
It's actually not a bad hero this season though.

2977
02:25:54,620 --> 02:25:54,920
Thor?

2978
02:25:55,100 --> 02:25:57,980
Thor is like legit just buffed every single patch.

2979
02:25:58,640 --> 02:26:02,120
I know, it's like silent buff and one buff, it's gonna be OP
as fuck.

2980
02:26:02,280 --> 02:26:07,200
I already think, I legit think it's OP already, like, but
it's just like only Thor one tricks that are good at him.

2981
02:26:08,120 --> 02:26:10,240
The problem is the punish windows are just too high.

2982
02:26:10,240 --> 02:26:18,580
like you just get like one shot if you like ever misplay
once the enemy team is very coordinated i mean i feel like

2983
02:26:18,580 --> 02:26:28,300
it's pretty maybe but like yeah i think the only champ that
like hard the counters them is bucky but otherwise he's

2984
02:26:28,300 --> 02:26:37,500
legit final boss the dude just gets a shield with every
ability cast by the way test the guy that plays dead he also

2985
02:26:37,500 --> 02:26:43,660
can he also has like a wolf grab basically like a mini wolf
grab that doesn't have a cooldown but they're having a

2986
02:26:43,660 --> 02:26:51,880
conversation i'm listening i'm being a good listener throw
in the bag no i've seen it play it i'm listening like the

2987
02:26:51,880 --> 02:27:01,480
one tricks i'm trying to learn from my sempas that's that
pool one trick and then i'm going for four i usually i play

2988
02:27:01,480 --> 02:27:07,320
every character at least i try but it's very hard to get
better at the one tricks to be honest i just need to watch

2989
02:27:07,320 --> 02:27:15,340
them and just like copy their and then once I'm at the stage
where they had I just individualized myself obviously I want

2990
02:27:15,340 --> 02:27:23,770
to do that before as well but that is good for one tricks I
guess there's like one controller guy that just has aim

2991
02:27:23,770 --> 02:27:34,450
assist every dragon rock oh that guy's a problem every every
4f is just like free to connect on the enemy backline yeah

2992
02:27:34,450 --> 02:27:46,690
it's so big bro he doesn't even have to aim it is true i
mean on a melee i'm not sure you need aim assist though i

2993
02:27:46,690 --> 02:27:54,610
think they should ban aim assist anonymically in pro play i
said it multiple times and i agree until i die that's why

2994
02:27:54,610 --> 02:28:08,210
there's a lot of uh really good dps player on aim assist or
what yeah i mean not on not on dps like i i i get it like

2995
02:28:08,210 --> 02:28:17,110
controller like i i get that you know i had this discussion
all the time controller without aim assist is unplayable at

2996
02:28:17,110 --> 02:28:23,790
pro level like i get it it's it's unplayable thank you thank

3002
02:29:06,650 --> 02:29:14,890
the regular show is now a fortnite skin and also ed ed ready
and also the same problem um there was one more i forgot

3003
02:29:14,890 --> 02:29:21,310
what the other one was i was like holy they've been just
fucking non-stop releasing skins now it's actually a bit too

3004
02:29:21,310 --> 02:29:30,290
much i actually it's it's i have to actually admit that
they're actually going wild with fortnite collabs yeah i

3005
02:29:30,290 --> 02:29:44,210
think so too i'd be missing i mean see you guys are naming
so much and i'm like yeah all of this yes that's not good

3006
02:29:48,310 --> 02:29:56,950
oh now it's too much luck they've been really it's they've
been releasing so many skins and oh I'm ready I was talking

02:29:56,950 --> 02:30:08,570
about Fortnite to my chat thanks for the quality content my

3010
02:30:15,870 --> 02:30:19,790
Yeah, I think it's just, it's like, it's like they haven't
stopped.

3011
02:30:19,890 --> 02:30:23,850
I felt like before it, they would, there was like a buffer
period in between.

3012
02:30:24,270 --> 02:30:29,930
But then they realized Fortnite Epic finally realized
they're like, wait, we can just keep going.

3013
02:30:32,470 --> 02:30:37,510
They're like, wait, guys, FOMO works.

3014
02:30:38,330 --> 02:30:41,110
We just, we can't just, we can't just keep going.

3015
02:30:41,110 --> 02:30:45,050
Like you're saying very publicly that we need to ban, they
need to ban Jeff against us.

3016
02:30:45,130 --> 02:30:55,650
the broadcast your problem i mean he has a point it's good
ban against us we cannot serve first save it if nothing

3017
02:30:55,650 --> 02:31:02,390
works i think that's the next best thing i mean we first
just first save jeff they realized they figured it out and

3018
02:31:02,390 --> 02:31:08,630
then we completely like now they'll never stop they only
took them like four years but now they figured it out yeah

3019
02:31:08,630 --> 02:31:16,170
oh wait jokies on bans jokies on bans oh my god okay okay i
got it I got this.

3020
02:31:16,870 --> 02:31:26,530
I didn't even realize Okay, we want to play DD.

3021
02:31:27,370 --> 02:31:30,130
Yeah, we need to be in the backline 24-7

3022
02:31:36,030 --> 02:31:37,950
What do I do next?

3023
02:31:39,590 --> 02:31:39,990
Wait it first.

3024
02:31:40,550 --> 02:31:41,250
Let's see what this is.

3025
02:31:41,670 --> 02:31:43,150
Okay, then we decide to ban Mantis.

3026
02:31:43,410 --> 02:31:46,930
Yeah, or Mantis ban Okay Okay.

3027
02:31:47,010 --> 02:31:47,410
Mentipen.

3028
02:31:49,890 --> 02:31:52,470
Then let's see.

3029
02:31:53,570 --> 02:31:54,370
Phoenix I guess.

3030
02:31:57,230 --> 02:31:57,370
Okay.

3031
02:31:58,910 --> 02:31:59,890
Oh, there it is.

3032
02:32:00,070 --> 02:32:00,410
Looks good.

3033
02:32:00,950 --> 02:32:01,850
What are you trying to last ban?

3034
02:32:02,630 --> 02:32:03,690
Yeah, that's the question, right?

3035
02:32:03,890 --> 02:32:06,350
Because I was thinking, I was thinking, I was thinking how
lower and a more.

3036
02:32:06,810 --> 02:32:07,310
Or Angela.

3037
02:32:08,010 --> 02:32:08,910
Yeah, I had on a more.

3038
02:32:09,030 --> 02:32:09,430
It's good then.

3039
02:32:11,710 --> 02:32:12,950
I don't think it should be hella.

3040
02:32:12,970 --> 02:32:14,110
Hella is very easy to die.

3041
02:32:14,350 --> 02:32:15,490
But the ult was very strong.

3042
02:32:15,510 --> 02:32:23,570
against us like it's yeah it's just annoying like we have
nothing to break it yeah i could be saving phoenix for it

3043
02:32:23,570 --> 02:32:33,150
but like that was that was kind of hard because they're not
so long why are we banning let's see it look hella is not

3044
02:32:33,150 --> 02:32:43,730
that they do they have dead every player they don't no j3
gail i think we ban i think we ban hella okay hella's fine

3045
02:32:43,730 --> 02:32:57,960
yeah what do we save We save They're gonna go bucky most
likely we save Jeff Okay, yeah, Jeff Yeah, I did my job

3046
02:32:59,770 --> 02:33:00,610
Yeah, it's okay.

3047
02:33:00,670 --> 02:33:01,830
That's 90% of the work.

3048
02:33:02,050 --> 02:33:07,190
Yep got it Clocking out doing it for the vibes now.

3049
02:33:07,190 --> 02:33:13,150
Oh, he's the guy that said You can go Jeff cloak if you
want.

3050
02:33:13,310 --> 02:33:16,790
Oh, yeah What do you want instead?

3051
02:33:16,890 --> 02:33:17,390
Luna or Cloak?

3052
02:33:17,750 --> 02:33:20,150
Luna, you have to play super passive and super slow.

3053
02:33:20,370 --> 02:33:20,430
Okay.

3054
02:33:20,730 --> 02:33:21,710
Go full dive, go full dive.

3055
02:33:21,970 --> 02:33:23,490
Go cap, cap Angela or cap Venom.

3056
02:33:24,030 --> 02:33:25,410
I think cap Venom for Luna.

3057
02:33:26,050 --> 02:33:27,350
Do I do Cloak or Luna?

3058
02:33:27,890 --> 02:33:32,210
Have you guys played against that one duo, like Monarch and
someone else?

3059
02:33:32,290 --> 02:33:34,110
They play like Adam Luna and just perma flank.

3060
02:33:34,510 --> 02:33:36,550
Like the guy's snowflakes himself and just flanks.

3061
02:33:37,450 --> 02:33:38,530
I think you can do that too, yeah.

3062
02:33:39,510 --> 02:33:40,910
Wait, you want me on Cloak or Luna?

3063
02:33:41,350 --> 02:33:42,090
I'm Luna Snow.

3064
02:33:42,430 --> 02:33:42,870
We are.

3065
02:33:42,890 --> 02:33:43,630
I'm Luna Snow.

3066
02:33:44,350 --> 02:33:44,750
Ah.

3067
02:33:45,750 --> 02:33:46,150
Luna?

3068
02:33:46,710 --> 02:33:48,030
I think Luna's better, yeah.

3069
02:33:48,330 --> 02:33:50,390
I think it's gonna, I think it's like hard to heal us.

3070
02:33:50,690 --> 02:33:50,710
All right.

3071
02:33:51,150 --> 02:33:53,510
We want me to give the first flake too.

3072
02:33:54,330 --> 02:33:54,730
Okay.

3073
02:33:55,530 --> 02:33:55,710
All right.

3074
02:33:56,150 --> 02:33:58,970
And Winnie and me and DAP just flank and roam the map.

3075
02:33:59,250 --> 02:34:01,690
DAP you play above Moxie and Doki, I think.

3076
02:34:02,330 --> 02:34:03,150
I play with Moxie.

3077
02:34:03,950 --> 02:34:06,110
Do you want me to play with you guys or play with the speed?

3078
02:34:08,290 --> 02:34:13,690
I'm going to create opportunity for speed for you to get a,
to get a grab on the enemy or grab on the enemy backline.

3079
02:34:15,510 --> 02:34:17,590
So said Winnie fell with me and with speed.

3080
02:34:17,990 --> 02:34:19,530
Should be helpful to them to stop it.

3081
02:34:19,750 --> 02:34:20,090
No sparring.

3082
02:34:20,630 --> 02:34:21,950
Did you say?

3083
02:34:21,990 --> 02:34:28,950
2, 1 I said have three people split, me, Speed, and Winnie
and we go back.

3084
02:34:28,950 --> 02:34:30,690
I'm gonna try to go top left, like far top left.

3085
02:34:30,870 --> 02:34:31,730
I'm playing top right.

3086
02:34:31,910 --> 02:34:32,410
I'm playing top right.

3087
02:34:32,610 --> 02:34:34,290
Okay, I play with you, Moxy.

3088
02:34:35,070 --> 02:34:37,270
I play bug key, sing, and aim more top left.

3089
02:34:37,590 --> 02:34:37,910
Yeah, I see.

3090
02:34:37,990 --> 02:34:39,450
Yeah, I see looking at his top left.

3091
02:34:40,330 --> 02:34:40,650
Yeah, okay.

3092
02:34:40,770 --> 02:34:41,450
When they drop, I can go.

3093
02:34:41,570 --> 02:34:41,910
When they drop.

3094
02:34:42,170 --> 02:34:43,370
Okay, I'm looking.

3095
02:34:43,370 --> 02:34:44,410
I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking.

3096
02:34:44,770 --> 02:34:46,210
Three, two, one.

3097
02:34:46,490 --> 02:34:46,990
Maloki, look, look.

3098
02:34:47,110 --> 02:34:47,730
CC'd stunned.

3099
02:34:48,470 --> 02:34:49,250
Yeah, I need, I'm living.

3100
02:34:49,350 --> 02:34:49,730
I'm living, I'm living.

3101
02:34:49,850 --> 02:34:50,010
Can we lift?

3102
02:34:50,090 --> 02:34:50,350
Can we lift?

3103
02:34:51,630 --> 02:34:51,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3104
02:34:51,950 --> 02:34:52,250
Okay, I can go.

3105
02:34:52,730 --> 02:34:52,970
I can go.

3106
02:34:52,970 --> 02:34:55,270
Three, two, one.

3107
02:34:58,110 --> 02:34:58,350
Go now, go now.

3108
02:34:58,350 --> 02:34:59,110
Throw a stun in.

3109
02:34:59,130 --> 02:34:59,290
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3110
02:34:59,290 --> 02:35:01,510
Throw on me, on me, on me, on me.

3111
02:35:01,790 --> 02:35:02,470
I hit back then again.

3112
02:35:02,510 --> 02:35:02,570
What?

3113
02:35:02,910 --> 02:35:17,910
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm
on, I'm on, I'm No, I'm living, I'm living, I'm living.

3114
02:35:17,910 --> 02:35:18,430
I have to reload.

3115
02:35:19,090 --> 02:35:19,850
I have to reload, sorry.

3116
02:35:21,310 --> 02:35:22,130
Go, go, go, go, go.

3117
02:35:22,810 --> 02:35:23,490
Yeah, we can win.

3118
02:35:23,590 --> 02:35:23,790
We can win.

3119
02:35:23,790 --> 02:35:24,670
I can go back then.

3120
02:35:24,730 --> 02:35:25,650
I can go back then.

3121
02:35:25,990 --> 02:35:26,350
Oh, no, I can't.

3122
02:35:26,690 --> 02:35:26,910
I can't.

3123
02:35:26,910 --> 02:35:27,010
Ringmark.

3124
02:35:27,410 --> 02:35:27,670
Or I'm on.

3125
02:35:27,670 --> 02:35:29,830
Ringmark, ringmark.

3126
02:35:30,090 --> 02:35:32,830
I don't think I can play Angeline to this, bro.

3127
02:35:33,350 --> 02:35:34,150
Yeah, you need to go Venom.

3128
02:35:35,450 --> 02:35:35,650
You need to go Venom.

3129
02:35:35,650 --> 02:35:36,070
I think Venom is tough.

3130
02:35:36,110 --> 02:35:37,230
Yeah, Venom, honestly.

3131
02:35:39,130 --> 02:35:39,490
Venom's good.

3132
02:35:39,510 --> 02:35:39,970
I think I have.

3133
02:35:40,530 --> 02:35:41,030
No diamond.

3134
02:35:41,250 --> 02:35:41,410
No diamond.

3135
02:35:41,490 --> 02:35:43,050
But you want to go, you want to go Emma.

3136
02:35:43,530 --> 02:35:44,570
I'm going not to.

3137
02:35:45,290 --> 02:35:45,690
Just wait.

3138
02:35:46,070 --> 02:35:46,390
Just wait.

3139
02:35:48,150 --> 02:35:48,670
I'll go behind.

3140
02:35:48,850 --> 02:35:49,230
I'll go behind.

3141
02:35:49,950 --> 02:35:51,270
Yeah, they're back on the bottom left or not.

3142
02:35:52,150 --> 02:35:53,330
Yeah, I'm going behind.

3143
02:35:54,710 --> 02:35:55,350
They're all coming back.

3144
02:35:55,510 --> 02:35:55,910
They're all coming back.

3145
02:35:56,050 --> 02:35:57,370
Yeah, I'm going behind.

3146
02:35:57,370 --> 02:35:57,470
I can go.

3147
02:35:57,730 --> 02:35:57,950
Yep.

3148
02:35:58,230 --> 02:35:59,150
Can you finish on the side?

3149
02:35:59,390 --> 02:36:00,070
Can you finish on the side?

3150
02:36:00,370 --> 02:36:00,750
Yeah, I'm going.

3151
02:36:01,390 --> 02:36:01,470

Okay, visit, visit, visit, visit.

Two, one, two, one, two, one.

Lift, lift, lift, lift, lift.

3157

No, lift, no, lift.

3158

I ain't out there.

3159
02:36:08,350 --> 02:36:09,290
Three, two more.

3160
02:36:09,290 --> 02:36:11,090
Wait, no ammo one, ammo one, ammo one!

3161

No more one, no more one, no more one, no more one.

02:36:14,390 --> 02:36:15,650
No key, no key, no key, no key.

I have all, I have all.

3164

I have the ammo.

3165
02:36:17,270 --> 02:36:17,730
He's got a combo.

3166
02:36:17,950 --> 02:36:18,450
He's got a damage combo.

3167
02:36:19,330 --> 02:36:20,170
Nemo, Nemo is coming.

3168
02:36:20,270 --> 02:36:22,270
Yeah, just limit, just limit, limit, limit, limit.

3169
02:36:22,290 --> 02:36:22,770
Kill it, kill it.

3170

Three, two, one.

3171
02:36:25,490 --> 02:36:27,790
Nemo one, Nemo one, Nemo one, Nemo one, Nemo one.

I have DDO.

3174
02:36:29,870 --> 02:36:30,170
I have DDO.

3175
02:36:30,670 --> 02:36:31,530
Yeah, yeah, reset DDO.

3176
02:36:31,710 --> 02:36:32,770
Can we, can we go now?

3177
02:36:32,870 --> 02:36:33,110
Can we go now?

3178
02:36:33,410 --> 02:36:33,790
Yes, I can.

3179
02:36:33,950 --> 02:36:35,790
Three, two, one, go.

3180
02:36:36,470 --> 02:36:37,310
Okay, I need y'all.

3181
02:36:37,670 --> 02:36:37,950
I'm out.

3182
02:36:38,150 --> 02:36:38,570
I froze.

3183
02:36:38,950 --> 02:36:39,070
I froze.

3184
02:36:39,430 --> 02:36:39,710
I'm hitting.

3185
02:36:40,810 --> 02:36:40,990
I'm hitting.

3186
02:36:42,090 --> 02:36:43,270
I'm trying to.

3187
02:36:44,050 --> 02:36:45,210
I'm trying to.

3188
02:36:45,250 --> 02:36:45,610
I come in.

3189
02:36:45,610 --> 02:36:46,170
I come in.

3190
02:36:46,310 --> 02:36:47,510
Then go back land too.

3191
02:36:47,750 --> 02:36:49,490
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3192
02:36:50,690 --> 02:36:50,930
Oh no.

3193
02:36:51,350 --> 02:36:52,850
I don't think I'm on.

3194
02:36:53,350 --> 02:36:55,390
Everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone.

3195
02:36:55,390 --> 02:37:00,850
Look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look,

just wait, just wait, just wait.

3197
02:37:05,950 --> 02:37:06,270
Yeah.

3198
02:37:06,510 --> 02:37:07,790
They use them though.

3199
02:37:08,530 --> 02:37:08,690
They use them though.

3200
02:37:08,690 --> 02:37:09,270
They use them though.

3201
02:37:09,710 --> 02:37:10,690
I'm never going to hold the gate.

3202
02:37:10,870 --> 02:37:11,410
They just save your name.

3203
02:37:11,490 --> 02:37:12,470
They still have things.

3204
02:37:12,830 --> 02:37:13,690
We should go early again.

3205
02:37:13,730 --> 02:37:14,250
We should go early again.

3206
02:37:14,390 --> 02:37:14,970
Before they get to the point.

3207
02:37:15,190 --> 02:37:15,530
Yeah, I can.

3208
02:37:15,910 --> 02:37:16,770
Wait, we look soon.

3209
02:37:17,290 --> 02:37:18,050
They're top right.

3210
02:37:18,470 --> 02:37:19,130
I'm better go.

3211
02:37:19,210 --> 02:37:20,250
Better go.

3212
02:37:20,370 --> 02:37:24,570
I froze the thing.

3213
02:37:25,190 --> 02:37:25,250
Okay.

3214
02:37:25,510 --> 02:37:25,530
I froze the thing.

3215
02:37:25,530 --> 02:37:26,270
Chill, chill, chill, chill, chill.

3216
02:37:26,990 --> 02:37:31,310
Look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look,

3218
02:37:35,270 --> 02:37:35,490
Stagger, Sagger.

3219
02:37:35,610 --> 02:37:36,590
Stagger, don't fight.

3220
02:37:36,650 --> 02:37:37,130
Don't care, don't kill.

3221
02:37:37,230 --> 02:37:37,510
Just live.

3222
02:37:37,630 --> 02:37:37,870
Come here, jump out.

3223
02:37:37,890 --> 02:37:38,010
Feel?

3224
02:37:38,050 --> 02:37:38,350
Jump out.

3225
02:37:40,310 --> 02:37:40,590
It's focused.

3226
02:37:41,170 --> 02:37:41,830
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

3227
02:37:42,410 --> 02:37:43,330
I'm walking up.

3228
02:37:43,750 --> 02:37:44,770
Look at the top left.

3229
02:37:45,090 --> 02:37:46,170
Yeah, I still have Seed.

3230
02:37:46,710 --> 02:37:47,390
Yeah, I see three top left.

3231
02:37:47,490 --> 02:37:48,030
I see three top left.

3232
02:37:48,130 --> 02:37:48,830
I can go now.

3233
02:37:49,650 --> 02:37:49,790
Ready?

3234
02:37:49,890 --> 02:37:50,250
You gonna go now?

3235
02:37:50,470 --> 02:37:50,750
I can go down.

02:37:55,230 --> 02:37:56,210

02:37:56,270 --> 02:37:56,790
Yeah, chill, chill.

3239
02:37:57,430 --> 02:37:57,850
I'm out.

3240
02:37:58,090 --> 02:37:58,170
I'm out.

3241
02:37:58,170 --> 02:37:58,350
I'm out.

3242
02:37:58,690 --> 02:37:58,770
Go.

3243
02:37:59,250 --> 02:37:59,670
They've no left.

3244
02:38:00,170 --> 02:38:00,690
I can go back in.

3245
02:38:05,050 --> 02:38:05,650
I'm on.

3246
02:38:05,670 --> 02:38:06,090
I kill the more.

3247
02:38:06,430 --> 02:38:07,310
I'm on.

3248
02:38:07,690 --> 02:38:07,830
I'm on.

3249
02:38:08,030 --> 02:38:08,050
I'm on.

3250
02:38:08,050 --> 02:38:08,210
I'm on.

3251
02:38:08,210 --> 02:38:08,230
Bucky.

3252
02:38:08,550 --> 02:38:08,610
Bucky.

3253
02:38:08,930 --> 02:38:09,210
Troll.

3254
02:38:09,830 --> 02:38:10,950
I'm dead.

3255
02:38:11,990 --> 02:38:12,450
I'm dead.

3256
02:38:13,090 --> 02:38:13,450
I'm dead.

3257
02:38:14,810 --> 02:38:14,910
I'm on.

3258
02:38:15,730 --> 02:38:16,190
Bucky.

3259
02:38:16,990 --> 02:38:17,170
Bucky.

3260
02:38:18,870 --> 02:38:19,790
Bucky outside.

3261
02:38:20,730 --> 02:38:20,890
Bucky.

3262
02:38:21,350 --> 02:38:21,810
Bucky.

3263
02:38:21,810 --> 02:38:25,070
He grabbed me instead.

3264
02:38:25,310 --> 02:38:25,750
He grabbed me instead.

3265
02:38:26,010 --> 02:38:26,810
I'm fine.

3266
02:38:27,710 --> 02:38:28,310
I'm fine.

3267
02:38:28,450 --> 02:38:28,490
I'm fine.

3268
02:38:28,490 --> 02:38:28,590
I'll go.

3269
02:38:29,850 --> 02:38:31,230
They're all low.

3270
02:38:31,330 --> 02:38:31,590
They're all low.

3271
02:38:33,910 --> 02:38:34,950
No more, no more no more.

3272
02:38:34,950 --> 02:38:35,790
No more, I'm also ice.

3273
02:38:35,790 --> 02:38:38,790
T's T's, T's, T's the one, T's, T's, T's!

3274
02:38:39,010 --> 02:38:39,010
T's one!

3275
02:38:39,050 --> 02:38:39,150
Yeah, yeah.

3276
02:38:39,290 --> 02:38:40,010
T's, Kuss, K's, K's, K, K!

3277
02:38:40,270 --> 02:38:45,190
T's, K's, K's, K, K's, K, K's, K, K's, K, K, K's, K's, K, K,
K!

3278
02:38:45,190 --> 02:38:46,270
Let's heal him.

3279
02:38:46,790 --> 02:38:47,110
Boo.

3280
02:38:47,270 --> 02:38:49,130
I think they use夠- Itís copy at the end.

3281
02:38:49,730 --> 02:38:50,310
Yeah, they did.

3282
02:38:50,890 --> 02:38:53,610
They used Bucky, copy, um...

3283
02:38:53,610 --> 02:38:55,790
You still have Emma, right?

3284
02:38:57,650 --> 02:38:57,970
Okay.

3285
02:38:57,970 --> 02:38:59,330
I think they're, yeah, they should have them though.

3286
02:39:00,150 --> 02:39:01,170
You can tell my life.

3287
02:39:01,830 --> 02:39:03,890
But what if it be fabulous to have an all-screen?

3288
02:39:07,850 --> 02:39:16,570
let's see the emerald is going to be a problem i kind of
want to hold early i think you keep toky bird for safety we

3289
02:39:16,570 --> 02:39:23,250
can go you need to save it when we go on points i like this
matchup that we're playing red okay so i don't all when

3290
02:39:23,250 --> 02:39:28,190
emeralds are you and just save it i think we're going i
think we're going with capital and they should okay yeah we

3291
02:39:28,190 --> 02:39:34,950
go with okay we go emeralds behind it and then we go after
okay we can maybe kill through i'm not sure I need to play

3292
02:39:34,950 --> 02:39:36,170
risky, I think.

3293
02:39:36,530 --> 02:39:38,890
Oh my god, there's disco lights when I ride.

3294
02:39:39,270 --> 02:39:39,810
Oh my god.

3295
02:39:39,950 --> 02:39:40,690
We just keep on doing that.

3296
02:39:40,870 --> 02:39:42,010
It's very hard for them to stop it.

3297
02:39:42,270 --> 02:39:43,030
They might go cloaky.

3298
02:39:43,130 --> 02:39:43,790
If they go cloaky.

3299
02:39:44,090 --> 02:39:45,010
Stand left.

3300
02:39:45,510 --> 02:39:45,990
Stand left.

3301
02:39:46,490 --> 02:39:47,650
Go right side.

3302
02:39:47,790 --> 02:39:48,470
Go right side.

3303
02:39:48,790 --> 02:39:49,070
Stand left.

3304
02:39:49,270 --> 02:39:50,770
I think if Coco's right side, we go left.

3305
02:39:51,210 --> 02:39:51,870
Yeah, right, right, right.

3306
02:39:51,870 --> 02:39:52,890
And I'm going to die.

3307
02:39:53,350 --> 02:39:54,470
Me and Trace may go top left.

3308
02:39:54,750 --> 02:39:55,330
Yeah, he goes up left.

3309
02:39:55,490 --> 02:39:56,150
I'm kind of slow.

3310
02:39:56,230 --> 02:39:56,890
I fucked up my shift.

3311
02:39:57,150 --> 02:39:57,550
Yeah, I'm chilling.

3312
02:39:57,950 --> 02:39:58,030
I'm chilling.

3313
02:39:58,190 --> 02:39:58,570
I'm chilling.

3314
02:39:59,630 --> 02:40:00,730
I see Star.

3315
02:40:00,790 --> 02:40:01,370
I see Star on point.

3316
02:40:01,510 --> 02:40:01,770
Star on point.

3317
02:40:02,050 --> 02:40:02,590
I'm with my...

3318
02:40:03,910 --> 02:40:04,930
Oh, they saw me.

3319
02:40:05,030 --> 02:40:05,190
They saw me.

3320
02:40:05,190 --> 02:40:05,630
They see us.

3321
02:40:05,690 --> 02:40:06,350
They see us.

3322
02:40:06,350 --> 02:40:07,330
They see us.

3323
02:40:07,450 --> 02:40:07,530
Oh, they see us.

3324
02:40:07,530 --> 02:40:07,650
Oh, yeah.

3325
02:40:07,650 --> 02:40:10,850
Three, two, one.

3326
02:40:11,890 --> 02:40:12,970
Baby, go, go, go, go, go.

3327
02:40:12,970 --> 02:40:13,730
I hit you.

3328
02:40:13,730 --> 02:40:15,070
Three, two, one.

3329
02:40:15,770 --> 02:40:15,870
Okay.

3330
02:40:15,910 --> 02:40:17,890
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.

3331
02:40:17,930 --> 02:40:19,050
Kill, kill, kill, kill.

3332
02:40:19,050 --> 02:40:20,430
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

3333
02:40:21,170 --> 02:40:22,990
Back to one, back to one, back to one, back to one, back to
one.

3334
02:40:23,050 --> 02:40:24,430
Back to one, back to one.

3335
02:40:25,070 --> 02:40:26,330
I'm chasing with you, excuse me.

3336
02:40:26,910 --> 02:40:27,630
Yeah, yeah, it's fine.

3337
02:40:27,890 --> 02:40:28,190
I was dead.

3338
02:40:28,710 --> 02:40:29,610
I was dead.

3339
02:40:29,610 --> 02:40:30,270
Just chill, just chill.

3340
02:40:30,450 --> 02:40:30,730
Good luck.

3341
02:40:30,870 --> 02:40:31,970
You should, Moxie.

3342
02:40:31,970 --> 02:40:33,130
Come on then.

3343
02:40:33,290 --> 02:40:33,490
One.

3344
02:40:34,830 --> 02:40:35,130
Just wait.

3345
02:40:35,230 --> 02:40:35,930
Just wait.

3346
02:40:36,390 --> 02:40:37,410
Angela, Angela.

3347
02:40:37,790 --> 02:40:37,850
Yeah.

3348
02:40:39,410 --> 02:40:40,790
And Vinny also tried to stun him.

3349
02:40:41,070 --> 02:40:43,970
Like if you stun him with right click, he's like always in
problem.

3350
02:40:44,990 --> 02:40:46,390
I'm going to play above the choke.

3351
02:40:46,490 --> 02:40:46,690
I see.

3352
02:40:46,790 --> 02:40:47,610
Let me scout.

3353
02:40:47,770 --> 02:40:47,950
Let me see.

3354
02:40:47,950 --> 02:40:48,870
I see four top left.

3355
02:40:49,490 --> 02:40:50,050
I see four top left.

3356
02:40:50,430 --> 02:40:51,510
Yo, can we hit top left?

3357
02:40:52,110 --> 02:40:52,430
I see Luna.

3358
02:40:52,550 --> 02:40:53,290
I can't.

3359
02:40:53,730 --> 02:40:54,310
Let him walk.

3360
02:40:54,370 --> 02:40:54,930
Let him walk first.

3361
02:40:55,030 --> 02:40:55,830
I'm going to go soon.

3362
02:40:55,910 --> 02:40:56,090
I'm going to go soon.

3363
02:40:56,090 --> 02:40:56,230
I'm going to go soon.

3364
02:40:56,290 --> 02:40:58,450
Three, two, one.

3365
02:40:59,930 --> 02:41:00,550
They're all on me.

3366
02:41:00,610 --> 02:41:00,830
I'm up.

3367
02:41:02,270 --> 02:41:02,950
Yeah, just chill.

3368
02:41:03,010 --> 02:41:04,290
We forced cooldowns.

3369
02:41:04,290 --> 02:41:04,710
I can't find you.

3370
02:41:04,790 --> 02:41:05,770
I don't really have a good angle.

3371
02:41:05,850 --> 02:41:07,010
I can go back in.

3372
02:41:07,030 --> 02:41:07,410
I can go back in.

3373
02:41:07,890 --> 02:41:09,770
Three, two, one.

3374
02:41:10,030 --> 02:41:11,710
Go, go, go, go, go.

3375
02:41:11,710 --> 02:41:12,770
Wait, you're so far from me.

3376
02:41:12,770 --> 02:41:13,050
I'm dead.

3377
02:41:13,150 --> 02:41:13,410
I'm dead.

3378
02:41:13,670 --> 02:41:14,270
Okay, chill, chill, chill.

3379
02:41:15,750 --> 02:41:15,990
I got it.

3380
02:41:15,990 --> 02:41:17,650
Keep up, keep up, keep up, keep up, keep up.

3381
02:41:17,650 --> 02:41:19,890
Live, live, live, live, live, live, live, live, live, live,
live.

3382
02:41:19,890 --> 02:41:22,630
Four, three, two, two, one.

3383
02:41:22,630 --> 02:41:26,430
I got hit, I got hit, I got hit.

3384
02:41:27,150 --> 02:41:29,050
He looks to a point, looks to a point, looks to a point,
trust me.

3385
02:41:29,470 --> 02:41:30,590
Look to a point.

3386
02:41:30,590 --> 02:41:31,310
Two one!

3387
02:41:31,310 --> 02:41:31,950
Two one.

3388
02:41:32,430 --> 02:41:34,270
One, one, one!

3389
02:41:34,270 --> 02:41:34,510
Starlot!

3390
02:41:34,510 --> 02:41:35,210
Starlot one!

3391
02:41:35,330 --> 02:41:35,770
Starlot one!

3392
02:41:35,850 --> 02:41:36,230
Starlot one!

3393
02:41:36,370 --> 02:41:39,130
I killed Starlot!

3394
02:41:40,670 --> 02:41:41,950
Emma one, Emma one, Emma one!

3395
02:41:41,950 --> 02:41:42,010
Emma one!

3396
02:41:42,010 --> 02:41:42,410
Yeah, Emma dies.

3397
02:41:42,750 --> 02:41:43,010
I need heal.

3398
02:41:43,710 --> 02:41:44,490
Angelou, Angelou.

3399
02:41:44,590 --> 02:41:46,890
They use Cloak, they use Starlord, they use Bucky.

3400
02:41:48,750 --> 02:41:50,130
They might take TPH.

3401
02:41:52,270 --> 02:41:54,830
If they TP, I can fight it with DDO.

3402
02:41:56,050 --> 02:41:56,910
Where's... okay, yeah.

3403
02:41:57,810 --> 02:41:58,630
That wind is, no?

3404
02:42:00,750 --> 02:42:02,010
Let me, let me go with mine.

3405
02:42:02,110 --> 02:42:02,510
Let me go with mine.

3406
02:42:02,630 --> 02:42:03,850
I can force it.

3407
02:42:03,850 --> 02:42:05,370
I'm playing on this like tree thing.

3408
02:42:05,430 --> 02:42:06,090
Top left.

3409
02:42:06,390 --> 02:42:08,250
I'm going for the whole thing.

3410
02:42:08,250 --> 02:42:08,790
I'm going for the drooling.

3411
02:42:08,890 --> 02:42:09,310
Five top left.

3412
02:42:09,410 --> 02:42:09,710
Five top left.

3413
02:42:09,910 --> 02:42:10,110
Two out.

3414
02:42:11,430 --> 02:42:11,530
Yeah, I'm shooting.

3415
02:42:11,650 --> 02:42:12,170
They're TPing.

This hero is so good that you're playing.

3523
02:45:53,850 --> 02:45:56,210
Either go Starlord or go or stay this.

02:45:56,770 --> 02:45:57,310
Both is good.

3525
02:45:57,490 --> 02:45:58,150
Starlord is also great.

3526
02:45:58,310 --> 02:45:58,850
On this map, no.

3527
02:45:58,990 --> 02:46:00,030
This map being stealthy better.

3528
02:46:00,590 --> 02:46:01,270
I'm saying they use Starlord.

3529
02:46:01,750 --> 02:46:02,250
You have ult.

3530
02:46:02,410 --> 02:46:03,450
You don't want to.

3531
02:46:03,450 --> 02:46:04,530
We just go with my ult.

3532
02:46:04,650 --> 02:46:05,230
They can't defend it.

3533
02:46:05,610 --> 02:46:05,750
Okay.

3534
02:46:07,170 --> 02:46:08,850
The cloak bubble is a problem guys.

3536
02:46:11,370 --> 02:46:12,150
They use Emma and Starlord.

3537
02:46:12,610 --> 02:46:13,850

Yeah, yeah, I think so.

3539
02:46:15,510 --> 02:46:16,590

They're close to it.

3546
02:46:52,390 --> 02:46:53,230

Two, one, forcing point.

I'm looking back.

3600
02:47:51,810 --> 02:47:52,150
I'm looking back.

3601
02:47:52,590 --> 02:47:53,930
I'm looking back.

3602
02:47:54,410 --> 02:47:54,730
I'm back.

3603
02:47:54,730 --> 02:47:54,890
I'm back.

3604
02:47:57,030 --> 02:47:57,350
I'm back.

3605
02:47:57,950 --> 02:47:58,310
I'm back.

3606
02:47:58,610 --> 02:47:58,890
I'm back.

3607
02:47:59,030 --> 02:47:59,270
I'm back.

3608
02:48:03,850 --> 02:48:04,650
I go back into my ulcer.

3609
02:48:05,590 --> 02:48:05,710
Yeah.

3610
02:48:07,030 --> 02:48:07,930
Could we go DL?

3611
02:48:09,350 --> 02:48:09,510
Yeah.

3612
02:48:09,510 --> 02:48:09,610
Yeah.

3613
02:48:09,710 --> 02:48:10,130
I'll go DL.

3614
02:48:10,670 --> 02:48:11,970
Three, two, one.

3615
02:48:12,110 --> 02:48:12,350
I'm also holding.

3616
02:48:14,850 --> 02:48:15,170
Yeah.

3617
02:48:15,170 --> 02:48:15,430
Yeah.

3618
02:48:16,090 --> 02:48:16,630
It's a Vicky.

3619
02:48:16,770 --> 02:48:17,410
Just protect the chef.

3620
02:48:17,590 --> 02:48:17,830
Protect the chef.

3621
02:48:18,230 --> 02:48:18,670
I know.

3622
02:48:19,550 --> 02:48:20,030
Nice

3623
02:48:32,430 --> 02:48:40,650
You can't get up and that Go back in after go no no no no no
next next

3624
02:48:44,670 --> 02:48:46,010
Need one good fight

3625
02:48:53,990 --> 02:48:55,090
Or group up.

3626
02:48:55,090 --> 02:48:55,750
We have one more point.

3627
02:48:55,830 --> 02:48:56,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3628
02:48:56,710 --> 02:48:57,930
I think Angie left.

3629
02:48:58,850 --> 02:48:59,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3630
02:48:59,230 --> 02:49:00,290
The back one's bottom left.

3631
02:49:00,290 --> 02:49:01,110
The back one's like bottom left.

3632
02:49:02,090 --> 02:49:02,410
Point.

3633
02:49:02,610 --> 02:49:03,170
Yeah, I go around.

3634
02:49:04,010 --> 02:49:04,710
I can hit you.

3635
02:49:04,930 --> 02:49:06,970
I'm going right.

3636
02:49:07,150 --> 02:49:08,090
I'm going to hit you.

3637
02:49:08,230 --> 02:49:08,490
Yeah, I connect you.

3638
02:49:08,590 --> 02:49:08,890
I connect you.

3639
02:49:08,950 --> 02:49:09,270
I connect you.

3640
02:49:09,470 --> 02:49:09,730
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3641
02:49:09,730 --> 02:49:11,410
Three, two, one.

3642
02:49:11,850 --> 02:49:13,790
I focused Invis in this small round.

3643
02:49:13,990 --> 02:49:15,090
Look, look, look, look.

3644
02:49:15,090 --> 02:49:15,910
We need to help him.

3645
02:49:16,010 --> 02:49:16,490
Trying to help.

3646
02:49:16,690 --> 02:49:17,190
Yeah, hear me.

3647
02:49:18,490 --> 02:49:19,390
Support, support, support one.

3648
02:49:19,530 --> 02:49:20,170
Support, support, one.

3649
02:49:20,170 --> 02:49:20,970
Invis, invis, invis, invis.

3650
02:49:20,970 --> 02:49:21,830
Yes, invis, invis, invis.

3651
02:49:22,610 --> 02:49:23,290
We need to TP.

3652
02:49:24,070 --> 02:49:25,250
Yeah, I will, I will.

3653
02:49:26,190 --> 02:49:26,930
Angela's on me.

3654
02:49:28,110 --> 02:49:29,770
Angela, Angela, you kill us.

3655
02:49:30,230 --> 02:49:30,910
Yeah, yeah, she's out.

3656
02:49:32,610 --> 02:49:33,130
She's out.

3657
02:49:33,330 --> 02:49:34,410
I can try to touch.

3658
02:49:38,090 --> 02:49:41,090
This matchup is so it's, oh my god, we need to ban Angela.

3659
02:49:42,950 --> 02:49:44,090
It's also just the cloak ult.

3660
02:49:44,270 --> 02:49:45,210
It's also the cloak, yeah.

3661
02:49:45,630 --> 02:49:47,550
It's legit 14 seconds.

3662
02:49:47,670 --> 02:49:49,470
It's just 14 seconds of strength.

3663
02:49:49,630 --> 02:49:50,450
It's really awesome.

3664
02:49:52,630 --> 02:49:53,790
Should I play cloak next?

3665
02:49:56,130 --> 02:49:58,250
I mean, I don't think that's about it.

3666
02:49:58,390 --> 02:50:00,030
I think what we have is a very good matchup.

3667
02:50:00,170 --> 02:50:01,650
We just need to really respect the Globals.

3668
02:50:01,830 --> 02:50:02,610
We're not killing the food.

3669
02:50:02,970 --> 02:50:03,910
Just respect it, okay?

3670
02:50:04,310 --> 02:50:05,390
And shoot the Angela more.

3671
02:50:05,590 --> 02:50:06,230
We need to ban it.

3672
02:50:06,410 --> 02:50:09,870
The Angela's, like, nowhere near us, like, half the time.

3673
02:50:10,130 --> 02:50:10,690
He's doing infinite.

3674
02:50:11,670 --> 02:50:12,230
He's doing infinite.

3675
02:50:12,450 --> 02:50:13,430
Is he marking you this time?

3676
02:50:13,570 --> 02:50:14,430
Because I didn't see him on me.

3677
02:50:14,610 --> 02:50:15,710
No, he's never on me.

3678
02:50:15,870 --> 02:50:16,850
He's never on me.

3679
02:50:17,250 --> 02:50:17,670
He's never on me.

3680
02:50:18,330 --> 02:50:20,130
But I don't know where he was other than that.

3681
02:50:20,330 --> 02:50:23,890
It's just legit stomper hero for uncoordinated gameplay.

3682
02:50:23,990 --> 02:50:30,770
it is really good like in this in this tournament angela is
too good because any mistake that we do like it's not even

3683
02:50:30,770 --> 02:50:36,670
on us but he just gets infinite punish windows speedily
because we don't have any opportunities so either we ban

3684
02:50:36,670 --> 02:50:48,770
clove or we ban angela i i really feel like angela is kind
of unbeatable in dive and i think we need angela to that

3685
02:50:48,770 --> 02:50:56,470
game i don't know i feel like dp you need to go here that
does more like on the map i know you do a lot but like maybe

3686
02:50:56,470 --> 02:50:59,410
more more pressure in the back then

3687
02:51:03,210 --> 02:51:17,230
but the problem is they just put counter pressure on us so
we have three people in the team not playing the game like

3688
02:51:17,230 --> 02:51:22,930
just by the angela flying around he's not even playing the
game he's just flying around wasting everyone's time it's

3689
02:51:22,930 --> 02:51:32,230
too good on a hero to not then oh yeah i get what you mean
speed we can also ban cloak the problem is every cloak dome

3690
02:51:32,230 --> 02:51:38,530
we can't kill fluke as i said right so it's like it waits
more time and more investment to clear i mean i feel like we

3691
02:51:38,530 --> 02:51:45,790
should be able to mag ulta in theory because like i know
they don't have a mag yeah i know but then they have

3692
02:51:45,790 --> 02:51:51,590
startled also wins the fight it's like super annoying i feel
like like maybe i'm not in like the right position when you

3693
02:51:51,590 --> 02:51:58,570
guys are diving like i feel like i'm always like more
towards like doki in the back like i'm trying to 100 yeah

3694
02:51:58,570 --> 02:52:06,990
i'm just following the first one was way easier because i
can like just reposition really easily and everyone's out in

3695
02:52:06,990 --> 02:52:13,790
the open i can just throw stun in when you dive yeah but
when you guys are like on the second map high ground i'm on

3696
02:52:13,790 --> 02:52:20,910
low ground point like should i be playing far left on our
side of spawn i don't know that was weird i think barring

3697
02:52:20,910 --> 02:52:25,550
angela also solves the problem because then you like play
more free because then blocking doesn't have that much

3698
02:52:25,550 --> 02:52:33,050
pressure i mean the only way to counter it is to if they go
cap but i don't think they get that also lugia go to cap

3699
02:52:33,050 --> 02:52:43,850
it's kind of so it should be fine can't really do that we
should just ban angela i think it's just too good of a hero

3700
02:52:43,850 --> 02:52:51,710
i'll type uh i'll type r yeah i'll do that i'll ban angela
now i think i give phoenix i'm not sure like the phoenix is

3701
02:52:51,710 --> 02:53:01,590
a problem though that bands are also not bad i don't really
see either of those two playing phoenix a lot i don't

3702
02:53:01,590 --> 02:53:13,810
doesn't gail play phoenix a lot i see him play it a lot i
i'm pretty sure he does play it a lot but honestly like you

3703
02:53:13,810 --> 02:53:21,310
could have stayed but we needed to swap and we could should
have went like oh we can't go into this it's bands we need

3704
02:53:21,310 --> 02:53:24,390
to play this We don't have anything to go.

3705
02:53:24,450 --> 02:53:27,570
There was one fight in the second round that was, like,
criminal for us to lose.

3706
02:53:27,710 --> 02:53:28,230
I'm not going to lie.

3707
02:53:28,450 --> 02:53:30,870
Like, the fight where both their supports were dead, and
they TP'd back.

3708
02:53:31,190 --> 02:53:32,130
That fight was unloosable.

3709
02:53:32,670 --> 02:53:33,090
I know, I know.

3710
02:53:34,010 --> 02:53:35,290
We had it in the back, to be honest.

3711
02:53:35,630 --> 02:53:36,330
We just gave it up.

3712
02:53:48,070 --> 02:53:49,350
I'm just a sheep.

3713
02:53:50,410 --> 02:53:51,370
I just listen.

3714
02:53:53,530 --> 02:53:54,430
I don't do.

3715
02:53:55,070 --> 02:53:55,730
Good Hawkeye map.

3716
02:53:56,030 --> 02:53:57,330
I have no free will.

3717
02:53:57,650 --> 02:53:58,430
Bro, it's a good Hawkeye map.

3718
02:53:58,710 --> 02:54:01,790
Hawkeye honestly would have maybe been okay that last map,
because you can kill Cloakote.

3719
02:54:02,450 --> 02:54:04,030
Oh, dude, you're actually right.

3720
02:54:05,470 --> 02:54:08,210
That's why I said, like, we should have maybe went brawl,
honestly.

3721
02:54:09,030 --> 02:54:10,570
But I do not want to give up on the dive.

3722
02:54:10,770 --> 02:54:12,030
I think we should keep playing it.

3723
02:54:12,230 --> 02:54:13,150
This is going to be 8, though.

3724
02:54:13,230 --> 02:54:15,010
They're going to bunker inside with triple tank.

3725
02:54:15,710 --> 02:54:16,430
Triple support.

3726
02:54:17,870 --> 02:54:18,690
Flock, I flank.

3727
02:54:18,970 --> 02:54:21,770
Oh, so trust you're the bad leader now.

3728
02:54:27,430 --> 02:54:28,910
Well, you'd rather play Storm, right, speed?

3729
02:54:29,790 --> 02:54:33,890
I feel like JetSafe is more important than DD Safe here.

3730
02:54:34,170 --> 02:54:36,030
Because they'll just go thing under and bunker as well.

3731
02:54:36,050 --> 02:54:43,310
free supports now or do you want these well if they're if
they're if they're like spawn holding i think i should play

3732
02:54:43,310 --> 02:54:54,610
storm yeah we just go storm and prove moonlight i guess yeah
do you have time on moon night i listen no i've never played

3733
02:54:54,610 --> 02:55:02,510
him in my life okay hey you got that i mean surely not that
hard you just like shoot the tanks yeah yeah surely and then

3734
02:55:02,510 --> 02:55:10,370
onk their back line maybe sometimes and this okay while
they're while they're banning i'll get my cough drops i'll

3735
02:55:10,370 --> 02:55:22,630
be right back oh i actually i actually think i banned this
it's too good of a hero i just i'm really glad and i lost

3736
02:55:22,630 --> 02:55:30,630
ben angela i think i don't think they have that good dps
players i think we just if they go phoenix we can still kill

3737
02:55:30,630 --> 02:55:33,870
him i don't think he's going to be turning the final boss
just because he's on phoenix

3738
02:55:36,930 --> 02:55:48,750
even though the hero is insane oh that's annoying I'm way
more worried about to be honest than Phoenix or by Loki and

3739
02:55:48,750 --> 02:55:58,210
Loki you say I'm back that means anything yeah actually
actually good point yeah I like that make it very annoying

3740
02:55:58,210 --> 02:56:06,310
for them I think so it's a good idea and then save Jeff for
us a full dive Miro Hawkeye is pretty good into Loki legal

3741
02:56:06,310 --> 02:56:15,410
that they get away doing that maybe have to save mantis then
actually and just go triple with mantis and with yeah yeah

3742
02:56:15,410 --> 02:56:21,490
actually yeah i think we can do that yeah i think in the
future we do that supports and four bands on both sides yeah

3743
02:56:21,490 --> 02:56:28,070
kind of so what do i play if we can force the front to back
with like triple support group then we can just like play

3744
02:56:28,070 --> 02:56:32,890
that pool okay luna o'clock luna

3745
02:56:39,140 --> 02:56:40,560
I think we go dive again.

3746
02:56:40,780 --> 02:56:41,980
I don't see why it shouldn't be there.

3747
02:56:43,300 --> 02:56:45,080
If they spawn all, do you want to go like Groot?

3748
02:56:46,420 --> 02:56:47,220
Groot Storm?

3749
02:56:47,500 --> 02:56:48,020
I don't know.

3750
02:56:48,260 --> 02:56:50,220
I don't think so.

3751
02:56:51,220 --> 02:56:53,120
Yeah, I feel like that might just feed support ults.

3752
02:56:53,340 --> 02:56:54,680
I think we should go backline.

3753
02:56:54,820 --> 02:56:56,520
They also don't have that good supports.

02:59:13,640 --> 02:59:14,420
Oh, we're dead.

3826
02:59:14,760 --> 02:59:15,240

02:59:29,300 --> 02:59:32,840
Now, this is a hard winning matchup, I believe, but we just
need to play better.

3839
02:59:33,080 --> 02:59:34,860
I really think that there's nothing else we can play.

3840
02:59:34,860 --> 02:59:35,300

03:01:23,200 --> 03:01:23,960
I'm not there.

3895
03:01:26,440 --> 03:01:27,420
In the slope.

3896

03:01:43,990 --> 03:01:45,650
Yeah, I'm going for two, one, taking it.

3905
03:01:45,810 --> 03:01:46,350
I've lost two.

3906
03:01:46,470 --> 03:01:47,770
We have little, we have little, no, let, let, let, let.

3907
03:01:47,790 --> 03:01:48,450
I'm trying.

3908
03:01:48,650 --> 03:01:49,150
I can't touch.

3909
03:01:49,150 --> 03:01:49,370
Oh, shit.

3910
03:01:49,550 --> 03:01:49,690
I'm not.

3911
03:01:50,230 --> 03:01:51,670
That's fucking Angela again.

3912
03:01:51,950 --> 03:01:52,830
I can't defend.

3913
03:01:53,490 --> 03:01:54,590
It's the only hero in the game.

3914
03:01:54,770 --> 03:01:56,590
It makes four people in my team useless.

3915
03:01:57,710 --> 03:02:01,470
And we can't hit because once you go in speedily, it just
needs one scoop and you're that.

3916
03:02:02,150 --> 03:02:03,750
And you have such a high punishment, though.

3917
03:02:03,930 --> 03:02:04,290
It's so insane.

3918
03:02:04,310 --> 03:02:04,810
I think he's marking you.

3919
03:02:04,810 --> 03:02:07,650
I he hasn't been on me like the moon.

3920
03:02:07,710 --> 03:02:09,610

He contest.

3922
03:02:11,130 --> 03:02:12,710
Guys, I do not play Starlord.

3923
03:02:13,410 --> 03:02:14,370
Like I'm gonna be honest.

3924
03:02:14,490 --> 03:02:15,590
I do not fucking play this.

3925
03:02:15,590 --> 03:02:17,370
Phoenix is okay.

3926
03:02:18,090 --> 03:02:18,950
I think we go triple.

3927
03:02:19,090 --> 03:02:20,010
I think we go triple here.

3928
03:02:20,290 --> 03:02:21,630

3929
03:02:22,030 --> 03:02:22,430
Close.

3930
03:02:22,870 --> 03:02:23,950
Cloak and dagger.

i think he controls the entire space my he marked me a
couple of times so I couldn't really do anything.

3942
03:03:06,890 --> 03:03:07,670
He just exists.

3943
03:03:07,910 --> 03:03:08,490
Where do you want to hold?

3944
03:03:08,590 --> 03:03:09,150
Where do you want to hold?

3945
03:03:10,310 --> 03:03:11,830
I'm gonna hold inside like...

03:03:11,830 --> 03:03:12,610
Break it, break it.

3947
03:03:14,210 --> 03:03:15,310
Break the wall.

3948

Break the walls.

3949
03:03:17,190 --> 03:03:17,570
Break the walls.

3950
03:03:19,190 --> 03:03:19,910
They're playing sing.

3951
03:03:21,130 --> 03:03:21,910
They're gonna die.

3952
03:03:22,110 --> 03:03:22,890
They're gonna die with sing.

3953
03:03:23,570 --> 03:03:24,550
They're gonna go Moonlight Storm.

3954
03:03:24,790 --> 03:03:25,670
I can shoot him from behind.

3955
03:03:27,610 --> 03:03:30,030
Yeah they're gonna hit our backline.

3956
03:03:31,270 --> 03:03:32,030
No, no, no, no.

3957
03:03:32,130 --> 03:03:32,430
Stormlight.

3958
03:03:32,970 --> 03:03:33,790
I eat us.

3959
03:03:34,810 --> 03:03:35,250
They can't.

3960
03:03:35,250 --> 03:03:35,390
They can't.

3961
03:03:36,070 --> 03:03:36,870
They can come in.

3962
03:03:37,390 --> 03:03:38,790
Two, two, two, two, two.

3963
03:03:38,790 --> 03:03:39,150
Two, two.

3964
03:03:39,150 --> 03:03:39,510
Okay, okay.

3965
03:03:39,670 --> 03:03:40,630
May we walk back up?

3966
03:03:40,710 --> 03:03:41,130
They know after.

3967
03:03:41,430 --> 03:03:41,870
Walk back up.

3968
03:03:42,090 --> 03:03:42,790
Two, one.

03:03:43,050 --> 03:03:43,910
Moon at all, kill.

3970
03:03:43,910 --> 03:03:44,510
I'm dead.

3971
03:03:47,570 --> 03:03:48,230
Define, define.

3972
03:03:48,570 --> 03:03:50,230
Maybe we're not going to do it.

3973
03:03:50,290 --> 03:03:50,550
We can.

3974
03:03:50,650 --> 03:03:50,930
We can't.

3975
03:03:50,930 --> 03:03:51,250
Keep the storm.

3976
03:03:51,370 --> 03:03:52,430
Kid the storm, storm, storm, storm.

3977
03:03:52,650 --> 03:03:54,930
Stom, one, storm one.

3978
03:03:55,710 --> 03:03:56,090
Oh, yeah.

3979
03:03:58,770 --> 03:03:59,170
There's...

3980
03:03:59,170 --> 03:04:00,050
Oh, shit.

3981
03:04:00,210 --> 03:04:00,890
The cards are moving.

3982
03:04:01,350 --> 03:04:02,470
Yeah, they're surrounded, guys.

3983
03:04:02,670 --> 03:04:03,570
Go strange TPM.

3984
03:04:05,750 --> 03:04:08,330
I'm back to shed some light.

3985
03:04:08,790 --> 03:04:09,390
Can you TP?

3986
03:04:10,430 --> 03:04:11,210
Yeah, we're TPing.

3987
03:04:11,210 --> 03:04:11,290
Oh, shoot.

3988
03:04:11,470 --> 03:04:12,170
We have Loki here soon.

3989
03:04:12,270 --> 03:04:13,070
I'm gonna go DD.

3990
03:04:14,130 --> 03:04:14,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3991
03:04:15,010 --> 03:04:15,570
I hit back on.

3992
03:04:15,730 --> 03:04:17,070
Two, one.

3993
03:04:17,230 --> 03:04:17,710
Touch the point.

3994
03:04:17,870 --> 03:04:18,230
Touch the point.

3995
03:04:18,290 --> 03:04:18,690
One rocker.

3996
03:04:19,970 --> 03:04:20,910
Yeah, I'm all.

3997
03:04:23,870 --> 03:04:24,630
Two one.

3998
03:04:25,370 --> 03:04:25,950
I'm lining.

3999
03:04:27,670 --> 03:04:28,550
Walk up with it then.

4000
03:04:28,910 --> 03:04:30,190
Oh, can't, can't, can't, can't, can't, come back, come back.

4001
03:04:30,290 --> 03:04:30,690
He's gonna kill.

4002
03:04:30,830 --> 03:04:31,370
You're gonna die.

4003
03:04:32,130 --> 03:04:33,390
This is real.

4004
03:04:33,390 --> 03:04:34,390
Fear is a word.

4005
03:04:34,810 --> 03:04:36,370
that's okay

4006
03:04:43,750 --> 03:04:57,670
oh my god i got doubled double stunned there i'm on rocket
i'm a rocket i needed to play

4007
03:05:04,810 --> 03:05:06,730
If I play this hero, we actually just win.

4008
03:05:07,430 --> 03:05:08,130
I don't want to do anything.

4009
03:05:10,570 --> 03:05:11,630
I can't shoot them.

4010
03:05:11,990 --> 03:05:14,610
I need a character that can shoot in this matchup.

4011
03:05:18,190 --> 03:05:18,790
It's fine.

4012
03:05:19,050 --> 03:05:20,930
We need to ban Angela and then we can play full-dive.

4013
03:05:21,430 --> 03:05:22,130
Full-dive should be unspoken.

4014
03:05:22,130 --> 03:05:23,610
Is there any other team that is...

4015
03:05:23,610 --> 03:05:25,550
I don't think you guys want me on Starlord.

4016
03:05:28,670 --> 03:05:30,190
Yeah, but I feel I was cooking on Hawkeye.

4017
03:05:31,190 --> 03:05:32,030
No, it was terrible.

4018
03:05:32,690 --> 03:05:33,930
No, no, I got insta-pick.

4019
03:05:35,110 --> 03:05:36,130
You can play...

4020
03:05:36,130 --> 03:05:43,770
you can play you're gonna play dd then i can go star star
yeah maybe that i could try dare double uh every starter is

4021
03:05:43,770 --> 03:05:50,470
a free fight win normally because they have nothing to
respond they only have raccoon in this they just emalted me

4022
03:05:50,470 --> 03:05:57,770
i mean i guess but that still forces emerald and you get a
window to kill them no and we killed them through when we

4023
03:05:57,770 --> 03:06:02,730
started with it we actually won the fight the question is
how we won it after the angela touched the point for half an

4024
03:06:02,730 --> 03:06:09,110
hour we didn't clear him because we can't shoot him so we
need to ban it that's just how it goes can we play another

4025
03:06:09,110 --> 03:06:18,290
match against them yeah we play three games we can see if we
can ban it need to get better i think

4026
03:06:31,150 --> 03:06:41,390
tough matchups don't know what else to do like silo is good
into this but like they don't have a good response to ults

4027
03:06:41,390 --> 03:06:48,970
we can shoot them if i go dd maybe i can headshot the
raccoon three times then we just win of that i can't do that

4028
03:06:48,970 --> 03:06:55,030
i just one shot i think if they do the same bad line and
we're gonna like have access to raccoon or something we just

4029
03:06:55,030 --> 03:07:00,230
save mantis instead of saving jeff last and then we just
come for the group triple support and play hawkeye into it i

4030
03:07:00,230 --> 03:07:08,870
also think maybe we need to save raccoon first or save jeff
first and then it's like fine again just say raccoon first

4031
03:07:08,870 --> 03:07:17,670
yeah i'm not sure nah this is fine what we do right now i
think but i think we don't have to yeah Yeah, the problem is

4032
03:07:17,670 --> 03:07:23,530
like we don't have the option to go triple now or like go
like when Mantis is banned, right?

4033
03:07:23,550 --> 03:07:29,770
We could have saved Mantis last and then we could have went
triple with Mantis like with Adam Mantis and Cloak or

4034
03:07:29,770 --> 03:07:30,130
something.

4035
03:07:31,090 --> 03:07:33,190
But because we couldn't do that, there's like no options.

4036
03:07:33,290 --> 03:07:35,870
If you save Mantis last, they are forced to like ban Loki.

4037
03:07:36,210 --> 03:07:39,630
So then you still have the Jeff open and you just have like
two lines open.

4038
03:07:39,830 --> 03:07:41,690
You have triple support and then you have Jeff type.

4039
03:07:43,190 --> 03:07:43,910
I think so too.

4040
03:07:50,580 --> 03:07:51,000
Okay.

4041
03:07:51,140 --> 03:07:51,460
I'm done.

4042
03:07:51,640 --> 03:08:02,280
listening I don't think really I see nothing against you but
the problem is if we play full me no think me listen on on

4043
03:08:02,280 --> 03:08:07,540
Hawkeye you can't kill the Angela like it will just not
happen so I need you to play a character that can shoot the

4044
03:08:07,540 --> 03:08:15,020
Angela more consistently Bucky I mean that is fine but it's
not really that good because it doesn't support the dive

4045
03:08:15,020 --> 03:08:21,580
like optimally you would want to play a hero that supports
both the dive and counters the Angela Star and phoenix are

4046
03:08:21,580 --> 03:08:27,700
the only three options kinda in that case that's what we
need so that's what i meant wow i didn't i didn't hear the

4047
03:08:27,700 --> 03:08:34,200
phoenix call in the beginning of the game yeah that's fine
it's fine it's the hella nameau as well they just went hell

4048
03:08:34,200 --> 03:08:38,580
but hella name os to be beautiful if we get i'm telling you
like against that team i don't think we banned phoenix i

4049
03:08:38,580 --> 03:08:46,480
think we've been a la i don't even think we've had any dps
honestly i think we really just 你祑 yeah i think we're just

4050
03:08:46,480 --> 03:08:53,540
not beating I just keep listening to the same when we played
the j3 tournament it's too hard to beat that hero

4051
03:08:58,840 --> 03:09:06,200
how come we don't have an angela the gamer 275 hp i think
she needed it on top of a 14 seconds we can't do that why is

4052
03:09:06,200 --> 03:09:10,420
it us why can't why are we the ones getting by angela yeah
it's fine

4053
03:09:17,440 --> 03:09:25,660
can we play one more can we ask them well we're supposed to
yeah i think they're just who are they wait yeah give it two

4054
03:09:25,660 --> 03:09:26,580
or three minutes

4055
03:09:38,350 --> 03:09:48,870
we wait guys i made a little i mean i also play daredevil
but like speed you got like probably infinitely more scrim

4056
03:09:48,870 --> 03:09:56,010
time than i can on daredevil ever i got no scrim time oh
well i'm sure the past three months well you got the script

4057
03:09:56,010 --> 03:10:09,890
you got scrim time all right you can you can play daredevil
bro you got that Oh, yeah, I was gonna say Um I made a

4058
03:10:09,890 --> 03:10:17,530
little oopsie So remember like how Twitch has those Like
sponsor things you can take And then so I took three of them

4059
03:10:17,530 --> 03:10:26,710
And the deadline is in two days I took three of them in the
beginning of the month And the deadline is in two days So we

like Bam bam bam I'll be like sponsor sponsors You just play

4061
03:10:33,750 --> 03:10:40,670

there's plenty of time i can get this done whenever i'm free

4062
03:10:40,670 --> 03:10:48,410
and then go in there you force cloak bubble and then
unfortunately um yeah i wasn't really free for a while and

4063
03:10:48,410 --> 03:10:55,530
then kill cloak or invis whichever one you see first check
check check

4064
03:10:58,670 --> 03:11:03,930
bro someone bro my chat is rage betting me so hard they said
shouldn't we play jeff rocket

4065
03:11:07,030 --> 03:11:08,950
Why didn't we play yeah, why didn't we play rocket?

4066
03:11:09,510 --> 03:11:16,910
Yeah, we should have just played rocket man But every
everyone has like always great ideas, but I mean what we

4067
03:11:16,910 --> 03:11:20,930
played is fine like we it was okay Two days we could have
made it closer.

4068
03:11:21,350 --> 03:11:23,090
I still have time Angela just stopped us twice.

4069
03:11:23,350 --> 03:11:26,710
I still have time And then we're fine because Angela's just
good into Jeff.

4070
03:11:26,970 --> 03:11:33,870
Angela's good into I still have time guys Angela's good into
stalling points, you know, so we need to get rid of it But

4071
03:11:33,870 --> 03:11:39,910
it's practically free money because one of them is rival And
then I'm streaming on YouTube so like that's a little oopsie

4072
03:11:39,910 --> 03:11:40,870
too, but don't worry.

4073
03:11:40,950 --> 03:11:41,190
Don't worry.

4074
03:11:41,270 --> 03:11:41,850
I still have time.

4075
03:11:42,010 --> 03:11:46,670
I still have two more days I still have two more days guys
before the deadline

4076
03:11:50,660 --> 03:11:52,700
Which one was this?

4077
03:11:53,520 --> 03:11:53,560
Oh

4078
03:12:02,860 --> 03:12:05,420
Yeah, I you can't keep doing this.

4079
03:12:05,460 --> 03:12:06,420
I can't help it.

4080
03:12:06,480 --> 03:12:07,860
I keep falling for it again

4081
03:12:11,060 --> 03:12:15,080
The good thing is we're always asking we're ready and
Phoenix is pretty broke.

4082
03:12:15,300 --> 03:12:23,600
We're ready someone pressed our for me i think so i think we
get in look okay i gotta pee again i'm sorry i've been

4083
03:12:23,600 --> 03:12:28,760
hydrating a lot because i've been coughing the last two days
has not been great for me coughing wise i'm i don't know why

4084
03:12:28,760 --> 03:12:37,920
i'm up it's pro wait is it a spotter map it's decent if they
have if they have wait this is a good spotter man map too

4085
03:12:37,920 --> 03:12:48,780
you should play spotter man no no this is asking i got pee
for real a lot because i'm i've been coughing a lot so

4086
03:12:48,780 --> 03:12:55,360

dive i think maybe we just go with cap venom next game and

4087
03:12:55,360 --> 03:13:02,480
we just find and we ban angela so we don't yeah it's just so
it's bro like well we ran some regular stuff with no dive

4088
03:13:02,480 --> 03:13:10,780
like last match no why not because we didn't have the
supports for it they banned every support that we could have

4089
03:13:10,780 --> 03:13:19,780
played check check check i mean we have to go open to be
honest you can play like cloak loki man

4090
03:13:25,580 --> 03:13:34,460
which hero do you think you want to be today problem is with
cap uh speedily i just go in and i just let legit get one

4091
03:13:34,460 --> 03:13:40,600
solid like just like yeah i know you also get one solid so
it's like like we can have the best timing for it but you

4092
03:13:40,600 --> 03:13:45,580
still get so i would rather play tank pool because then i
can shoot from range while still being in the fight you know

4093
03:13:45,580 --> 03:13:51,300
tank pool is just op yeah i was about to say like camp that
much better than tank pool because also on tank pool you you

4094
03:13:51,300 --> 03:13:57,740
give me like the the jeff team ups yeah i think so i think
we can play okay which heroes will get my conflict i'm back

4095
03:13:57,740 --> 03:14:12,320
once more once more log in nothing nothing is nothing is
lost i think we already lost this match No, but we can...

4096
03:14:12,320 --> 03:14:13,560
It's okay, round robin never matters.

4097
03:14:13,780 --> 03:14:15,200
We can win the third series.

4098
03:14:15,720 --> 03:14:17,480
Round robin actually doesn't matter, no?

4099
03:14:17,540 --> 03:14:18,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it doesn't matter.

4100
03:14:20,720 --> 03:14:21,960
Day two is where it's at.

4101
03:14:22,440 --> 03:14:26,120
Day one, we sandbag on purpose, so they think that that's
just a real comp.

4102
03:14:26,680 --> 03:14:27,340
Guys, we're even.

4103
03:14:27,500 --> 03:14:27,860
1-1.

4104
03:14:29,040 --> 03:14:29,920
No, Moxie.

4105
03:14:30,620 --> 03:14:32,020
First set, first set.

4106
03:14:33,080 --> 03:14:34,220
Last set, this set.

4107
03:14:34,700 --> 03:14:36,860
Oh, Moxie.

4108
03:14:38,340 --> 03:14:40,440
The game was not that bad for you to race.

4109
03:14:40,460 --> 03:14:41,200
basic.

4110
03:14:42,780 --> 03:14:44,360
Well, that man won one in the stats.

4111
03:14:51,340 --> 03:14:53,060
Wait did we not win the first set?

4112
03:14:54,960 --> 03:14:55,680
No, we did.

4113
03:14:56,040 --> 03:14:56,680
Yeah, we did.

4114
03:14:56,840 --> 03:14:57,140
Yeah, we did.

4115
03:14:58,860 --> 03:15:00,340
I'm tripping out.

4116
03:15:00,840 --> 03:15:02,100
Cook them cloak here.

4117
03:15:02,480 --> 03:15:03,980
I don't really want to do that.

4118
03:15:06,840 --> 03:15:07,220
Fuck it.

4119
03:15:07,220 --> 03:15:07,700
Do we do it?

4120
03:15:07,740 --> 03:15:08,440
We do it.

4121
03:15:10,500 --> 03:15:11,540
Give them everything.

4122
03:15:13,920 --> 03:15:14,400
Okay.

4123
03:15:14,420 --> 03:15:20,380
save man's tip they're gonna have namo hella maybe should
have banned hella instead on namo namo probably better game

4124
03:15:20,380 --> 03:15:21,620
in the future

4125
03:15:24,900 --> 03:15:34,080
then they're gonna go phoenix hella you'll need a top-notch
team to win this one i think it's just cap venom you want dd

4126
03:15:34,080 --> 03:15:37,300
moxie i'll go sigh cap venom okay

4127
03:15:40,750 --> 03:15:47,730
well if you if if i don't play dd what i'm playing phoenix i
think we go phoenix i think we go phoenix dd i think we go

4128
03:15:47,730 --> 03:15:57,750
phoenix dd i trust the speedery dd talking about you have to
like luna again probably all right yeah it's annoying but

4129
03:15:57,750 --> 03:16:01,250
the only thing that you can play because rock and spin

4130
03:16:05,050 --> 03:16:11,910
yeah and that's also been so we can't go triple the triple
was open i would play triple here we did an ultron we need

4131
03:16:11,910 --> 03:16:16,230
to we need to drone me and trust me damage boost one shot I
think so.

4132
03:16:16,530 --> 03:16:17,790
So who plays Ultron?

4133
03:16:18,670 --> 03:16:20,790
Wait, so no chance, so no chance of Hawkeye here?

4134
03:16:24,090 --> 03:16:24,450
Trust.

4135
03:16:24,650 --> 03:16:28,390
I think if we left, I think if we left Cloak, we might go
Hawkeye, but Cloak's man.

4136
03:16:29,670 --> 03:16:32,230
Wait, so should we go triple with Moxie on Ultron?

4137
03:16:33,110 --> 03:16:33,670
No, no, no, no.

4138
03:16:33,850 --> 03:16:34,430
I think this is fine.

4139
03:16:34,430 --> 03:16:35,650
Oh, actually, actually.

4140
03:16:36,130 --> 03:16:36,790
No, no, no, no.

4141
03:16:37,490 --> 03:16:38,090
This is fine.

4142
03:16:38,090 --> 03:16:40,170
We'll play the old knife tank and we'll play Mac.

4143
03:16:41,330 --> 03:16:42,610
You don't want to play that?

4144
03:16:42,870 --> 03:16:43,350
Yeah, it's fine.

4145
03:16:43,610 --> 03:16:44,070

03:16:52,990 --> 03:16:53,550
They have a Genome more.

4150
03:16:53,630 --> 03:16:54,070
They have a Giant more.

4151
03:16:54,310 --> 03:16:54,870

03:24:21,790 --> 03:24:22,110
I need heal.

4435
03:24:22,110 --> 03:24:22,490
I need to heal.

4436
03:24:23,270 --> 03:24:23,770
Torn walking.

4437
03:24:24,530 --> 03:24:25,030
What is!

4438
03:24:25,530 --> 03:24:26,430
Wait, hell no bird.

4439
03:24:26,990 --> 03:24:27,350
I should have the crowbar.

4440
03:24:27,350 --> 03:24:28,830
Only one.

4441
03:24:30,830 --> 03:24:32,690
Can I get it?

4442
03:24:32,690 --> 03:24:33,470
That one is mine too.

4443
03:24:33,470 --> 03:24:33,990
Can I do?

4444
03:24:35,230 --> 03:24:35,690
He has bubbles?

4445
03:24:35,850 --> 03:24:36,630
Hid it, hide it, hide it.

4446
03:24:36,750 --> 03:24:38,290
That one's mine.

4447
03:24:38,290 --> 03:24:39,410
I'm going three, two.

4448
03:24:39,570 --> 03:24:40,730
Come on.

4449
03:24:41,250 --> 03:24:41,910
Chuddy, shooting, shoot it!

4450
03:24:41,910 --> 03:24:42,590
Shoot it!

4451
03:24:42,730 --> 03:24:43,310
Oh, shoot it!

4452
03:24:43,690 --> 03:24:45,950
Yeah, you gotta shoot it, shoot it, shoot it, shoot it,
shoot.

4453
03:24:46,830 --> 03:24:47,510
Oh, what the fuck?

4454
03:24:48,490 --> 03:24:48,690
Wow.

4455
03:24:50,070 --> 03:24:51,190
Yeah, that's fine.

4456
03:24:51,250 --> 03:24:51,610
Altitude.

4457
03:24:52,950 --> 03:24:53,190
Ooh.

4458
03:24:59,390 --> 03:25:00,630
It's okay, matchup, I think.

4459
03:25:00,830 --> 03:25:01,850
Matchup is good.

4460
03:25:02,510 --> 03:25:03,030
Just don't know what to do.

4461
03:25:03,030 --> 03:25:04,790
We touch it?

4462
03:25:05,110 --> 03:25:05,390
Oh.

4463
03:25:07,910 --> 03:25:09,490
They haven't rocket ulted ever.

4464
03:25:10,330 --> 03:25:11,930
Like, when do I use my Phoenix?

4465
03:25:13,050 --> 03:25:15,130
I tried to use it on my run, then they...

4466
03:25:15,130 --> 03:25:15,550
I don't know.

4467
03:25:16,510 --> 03:25:18,570
If you don't use it, I think that's feeling better, I don't
know.

4468
03:25:18,690 --> 03:25:24,330
I think we can yeah, or we can combo with the Rimbus and we
can damage with the Finns ult.

4469
03:25:26,590 --> 03:25:28,310
Do we not play Loki in defense?

4470
03:25:29,370 --> 03:25:30,310
What do we do?

4471
03:25:30,710 --> 03:25:30,930
What?

4472
03:25:31,610 --> 03:25:32,890
Do we not play Loki in defense?

4473
03:25:34,170 --> 03:25:35,830
You want to play Loki defense?

4474
03:25:36,070 --> 03:25:36,290
Are you sure?

4475
03:25:37,070 --> 03:25:38,690
I don't know, I think it's...

4476
03:25:39,630 --> 03:25:41,170
You want to do Groot mag?

4477
03:25:42,590 --> 03:25:46,550
Groot mag, Loki, I mean we can, I mean you guys can play
some Groot mag, but I'll just play Daredevil still.

4478
03:25:46,750 --> 03:25:47,270
I think it's fine.

4479
03:25:49,290 --> 03:25:50,390
I don't even see that.

4480
03:25:50,670 --> 03:25:53,510
I feel like I go Deadpool then.

4481
03:25:55,890 --> 03:25:56,910
Hawkeye or Phoenix?

4482
03:25:57,390 --> 03:25:58,110
Go Hawkeye.

4483
03:25:59,310 --> 03:26:00,790
Things is better about this go Hawkeye.

4484
03:26:01,050 --> 03:26:03,250
It smells worse than Namor's trunks in here.

4485
03:26:03,330 --> 03:26:04,890
I believe in you, Maxi.

4486
03:26:05,150 --> 03:26:07,230
I feel like I've just been marking the cap the whole game.

4487
03:26:07,990 --> 03:26:08,170
Yeah.

4488
03:26:08,610 --> 03:26:08,690
Yeah.

4489
03:26:09,390 --> 03:26:10,730
Throwing me in, like, I don't know.

4490
03:26:12,650 --> 03:26:13,010
Yeah.

4491
03:26:13,590 --> 03:26:15,770
It's not like you have to do Infinite, but...

4492
03:26:15,770 --> 03:26:17,690
That's what Tony used to say to me back in the day.

4493
03:26:18,190 --> 03:26:18,510
It's okay.

4494
03:26:18,690 --> 03:26:23,370
And this is like old value because like they have they only
have like two squirrels And I'm always gonna force one like

4495
03:26:23,370 --> 03:26:27,990
we just need to like kill to kill or like force the other
one Really good matchup just need to play it a bit.

4496
03:26:28,230 --> 03:26:31,090
Yeah, they have like a fucking their squirrels are pretty
bad It's like rocket.

4497
03:26:31,210 --> 03:26:34,430
Yeah, let's do Just wait and play slow.

4498
03:26:34,430 --> 03:26:39,590
All right I'm just a man

4499
03:26:42,870 --> 03:26:44,450
They have emma emma

4500
03:26:49,590 --> 03:26:50,730
Do they have cap?

4501
03:26:51,930 --> 03:26:52,150
Yes.

4502
03:26:52,430 --> 03:26:52,970
I don't know.

4503
03:26:53,190 --> 03:26:53,530
No, they don't.

4504
03:26:54,030 --> 03:26:55,870
I think they've held them more.

4505
03:26:56,150 --> 03:27:00,510
I think they scouted our comp.

4506
03:27:00,610 --> 03:27:02,290
Yeah, I think they might do it.

4507
03:27:05,710 --> 03:27:06,950
You still want to dive, right?

4508
03:27:07,350 --> 03:27:07,830
Yeah, it's still.

4509
03:27:08,010 --> 03:27:09,390
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.

4510
03:27:10,430 --> 03:27:10,830
Hello.

03:27:10,830 --> 03:27:12,730
Three, two, one.

03:27:13,430 --> 03:27:14,870
Oh, but wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

4513
03:27:15,190 --> 03:27:17,350
Help him, help him, help him, help him.

03:27:18,690 --> 03:27:19,170
I got no lumps.

4515
03:27:19,630 --> 03:27:20,490
I got a lump of damage.

4516
03:27:20,630 --> 03:27:21,810
Kill the, kill the...

4517
03:27:21,810 --> 03:27:22,190
That's fine.

4518
03:27:22,710 --> 03:27:23,110
I'll actually...

4519
03:27:23,110 --> 03:27:24,630
I curse nothing to do.

4520
03:27:24,650 --> 03:27:25,350
Maybe hook the guy in.

4521
03:27:25,430 --> 03:27:26,070
I'm going hell then.

4522
03:27:26,410 --> 03:27:27,110
Three, two...

4523
03:27:27,110 --> 03:27:27,990
Hey, there's one, there's one.

4524
03:27:28,810 --> 03:27:30,510
Come on, hella, hella, hella.

4525
03:27:30,550 --> 03:27:31,210
I don't know.

4526
03:27:32,150 --> 03:27:33,070
Emma's running these two goals.

4527
03:27:33,570 --> 03:27:33,670
Yeah.

4528
03:27:34,530 --> 03:27:35,410
And we go back full-dive.

4529
03:27:35,570 --> 03:27:37,790
I actually think full-dive, go back death, go back
full-dive.

4530
03:27:37,970 --> 03:27:38,590
I don't want to do it.

4531
03:27:39,030 --> 03:27:40,610
I don't see how it doesn't win this.

4532
03:27:40,870 --> 03:27:42,910
100 out of 100, oh, the matchup win.

4533
03:27:45,850 --> 03:27:47,450
Let's go group up and then go back full-dive.

4534
03:27:50,510 --> 03:27:51,750
I cannot swap spawn.

4535
03:27:52,030 --> 03:27:52,750
I have lucky one.

4536
03:27:53,290 --> 03:27:54,010
You can stay close.

4537
03:27:54,030 --> 03:27:54,830
I mean, you stay this for one.

4538
03:27:55,150 --> 03:27:55,510
You can stay this for one.

4539
03:27:55,590 --> 03:27:56,750
You can stay this for one more fight.

4540
03:27:57,430 --> 03:27:57,750
Okay.

4541
03:27:58,530 --> 03:27:59,310
I can still point.

4542
03:27:59,450 --> 03:28:00,010
I'm going to still point.

4543
03:28:00,170 --> 03:28:00,910
Hella main.

4544
03:28:00,930 --> 03:28:01,690
Hella main by himself.

4545
03:28:01,970 --> 03:28:02,690
One Hella.

4546
03:28:03,530 --> 03:28:03,970
I'm stunned.

4547
03:28:04,090 --> 03:28:04,290
Hear me.

4548
03:28:04,330 --> 03:28:05,290
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

4549
03:28:05,290 --> 03:28:05,750
Need to go back.

4550
03:28:06,130 --> 03:28:06,650
Look at him.

4551
03:28:07,210 --> 03:28:07,570
I'm here.

4552
03:28:08,230 --> 03:28:08,730
Yeah, P is.

4553
03:28:08,730 --> 03:28:09,170
You walk back out.

4554
03:28:09,210 --> 03:28:09,750
You walk back out.

4555
03:28:10,250 --> 03:28:11,310
Okay, yeah, yeah.

4556
03:28:12,470 --> 03:28:13,570
Walk back out.

4557
03:28:13,570 --> 03:28:14,610
Walk back out.

4558
03:28:15,010 --> 03:28:15,550
Looky, top right.

4559
03:28:16,090 --> 03:28:17,510
Looky, looky, looky, looky, looky.

4560
03:28:17,550 --> 03:28:17,910
Looky, looky.

4561
03:28:18,730 --> 03:28:20,170
Your powers are mine.

4562
03:28:20,210 --> 03:28:20,570
I don't want to.

4563
03:28:21,770 --> 03:28:22,830
Can we, can we match?

4564
03:28:22,850 --> 03:28:23,610
Okay, walk it, walk it.

4565
03:28:23,810 --> 03:28:24,530
Don't walk it.

4566
03:28:24,530 --> 03:28:25,290
Don't walk it.

4567
03:28:26,050 --> 03:28:27,810
Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it.

4568
03:28:27,850 --> 03:28:28,190
I'm blinded.

4569
03:28:28,890 --> 03:28:29,690
I'm blinded.

4570
03:28:29,690 --> 03:28:30,630
I'm blinded.

4571
03:28:30,650 --> 03:28:32,970
Three, two, one.

4572
03:28:33,430 --> 03:28:33,750
I don't know.

4573
03:28:34,090 --> 03:28:35,850
I don't have, I just had all of it.

4574
03:28:35,890 --> 03:28:36,270
It's okay.

4575
03:28:36,370 --> 03:28:36,630
Go next.

4576
03:28:36,730 --> 03:28:37,990
I also didn't really die.

4577
03:28:38,370 --> 03:28:38,590
Yeah.

4578
03:28:39,050 --> 03:28:39,350
It's good.

4579
03:28:39,510 --> 03:28:40,410
What's the chance are you doing?

4580
03:28:41,790 --> 03:28:42,190
Okay.

4581
03:28:42,190 --> 03:28:43,090
The matchup's 50%.

4582
03:28:43,090 --> 03:28:43,470
They're good.

4583
03:28:44,210 --> 03:28:45,650
Go back, Phoenix, I think, yeah.

4584
03:28:46,710 --> 03:28:47,470
Need to go, Phoenix.

4585
03:28:56,840 --> 03:28:58,300
I'm gonna go right side.

4586
03:28:59,020 --> 03:28:59,900
There's your stuffing left.

4587
03:29:00,000 --> 03:29:00,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4588
03:29:00,720 --> 03:29:01,480
I'll go right then.

4589
03:29:01,920 --> 03:29:02,840
I can go with my old.

4590
03:29:05,020 --> 03:29:05,820
There's Loki.

4591
03:29:06,460 --> 03:29:06,860
There's Loki.

4592
03:29:07,720 --> 03:29:09,040
I'm going to Loki.

4593
03:29:09,040 --> 03:29:09,700
I'm going to, uh, Loki.

4594
03:29:09,840 --> 03:29:10,720
Three, two, one, one.

4595
03:29:11,720 --> 03:29:15,820
One, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one,
one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one,

4596
03:29:15,820 --> 03:29:17,160
one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one,
one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one,

4597
03:29:17,700 --> 03:29:18,880
one, one, No, we're good.

4598
03:29:19,220 --> 03:29:20,320
Yeah, Saker, Saker, Saker, Saker.

4599
03:29:20,500 --> 03:29:20,860
Saker, Saker, Saker.

4600
03:29:20,900 --> 03:29:21,520
Oh, my, I don't know.

4601
03:29:22,100 --> 03:29:22,720
Sorry, I don't know.

4602
03:29:23,440 --> 03:29:23,880
It's okay.

4603
03:29:24,400 --> 03:29:24,880
Or maybe.

4604
03:29:24,980 --> 03:29:25,640
We take too many.

4605
03:29:27,340 --> 03:29:28,480
They go back in with the...

4606
03:29:28,480 --> 03:29:29,340
They went rocket in this.

4607
03:29:30,200 --> 03:29:33,420
I think we have to hit really early, by the way, like all
the way up here before they can get to point.

4608
03:29:33,660 --> 03:29:34,300
Yeah, I think so.

4609
03:29:34,840 --> 03:29:36,060
We can also hit the DPS.

4610
03:29:36,360 --> 03:29:37,260
Should be very hard for them.

4611
03:29:37,400 --> 03:29:38,780
Su, Su, walk into the maze, Su, walk into the maze.

4612
03:29:38,900 --> 03:29:39,540
We go Su, you go Su.

4613
03:29:39,700 --> 03:29:41,800
3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1.

4614
03:29:43,720 --> 03:29:44,180
Hello, one.

4615
03:29:44,300 --> 03:29:44,660
I go back.

4616
03:29:44,900 --> 03:29:45,300
I'm grabbing.

4617
03:29:45,440 --> 03:29:45,800
I'm grabbing him.

4618
03:29:45,800 --> 03:29:46,580
Oh, no.

4619
03:29:46,720 --> 03:29:47,360
Come back, come back.

4620
03:29:47,500 --> 03:29:47,920
We can wait him.

4621
03:29:47,980 --> 03:29:48,360
We can wait him.

4622
03:29:48,380 --> 03:29:48,660
Just lift.

4623
03:29:48,720 --> 03:29:48,940
Just lift.

4624
03:29:49,820 --> 03:29:50,360
Give him a bit more.

4625
03:29:51,260 --> 03:29:51,660
I have my ult.

4626
03:29:52,500 --> 03:29:53,180
I can kill the Invis.

4627
03:29:53,280 --> 03:29:53,900
I can kill the Invis.

4628
03:29:54,060 --> 03:29:54,200
Get it.

4629
03:29:54,440 --> 03:29:54,500
Ready?

4630
03:29:55,140 --> 03:29:56,340
Three, two, one.

4631
03:29:56,360 --> 03:29:58,140
There's a captain behind us.

4632
03:29:58,420 --> 03:29:59,960
Invis one, in this one, in this one, in this one.

4633
03:30:02,740 --> 03:30:03,200
Invis low.

4634
03:30:03,320 --> 03:30:03,820
He'll do it.

4635
03:30:03,960 --> 03:30:05,120
I have a captain on me.

4636
03:30:05,600 --> 03:30:05,960
Can he help?

4637
03:30:06,420 --> 03:30:06,540
Yeah.

4638
03:30:08,780 --> 03:30:09,540
Yeah, I'm on help.

4639
03:30:09,680 --> 03:30:09,840

4640
03:30:11,520 --> 03:30:12,660
Cap, cap, cap.

4641
03:30:13,240 --> 03:30:13,760
One, one, one, one.

4642
03:30:13,960 --> 03:30:14,600
Shoot him, shoot him.

4643
03:30:15,800 --> 03:30:16,880
He can let the key heal.

4644
03:30:17,900 --> 03:30:18,800
He's out of the way.

4645
03:30:20,380 --> 03:30:21,800
I'm coming over.

4646
03:30:23,280 --> 03:30:24,080
Did they use anything?

4647
03:30:25,320 --> 03:30:25,740
Let's go back.

4648
03:30:25,900 --> 03:30:26,300
Just go back.

4649
03:30:26,600 --> 03:30:27,560
We play for high.

4650
03:30:28,120 --> 03:30:28,640
I'm here.

4651
03:30:29,480 --> 03:30:29,640
Okay.

4652
03:30:29,640 --> 03:30:31,560
I don't have Phoenix or from Rockett.

4653
03:30:31,760 --> 03:30:32,420
I'm sitting up up up.

4654
03:30:32,940 --> 03:30:33,160
I'm sitting up up.

4655
03:30:33,160 --> 03:30:34,340
Cap on the left.

4656
03:30:34,760 --> 03:30:35,580
You have far left or what?

4657
03:30:35,620 --> 03:30:36,140
Yeah, they're walking up.

4658
03:30:36,200 --> 03:30:36,780
Walking the main.

4659
03:30:36,940 --> 03:30:37,080
Can you go?

4660
03:30:37,300 --> 03:30:37,700
I can go.

4661
03:30:37,700 --> 03:30:37,880
I can go.

4662
03:30:38,220 --> 03:30:39,100
There's someone.

4663
03:30:42,720 --> 03:30:44,220
There's Captain America to our left.

4664
03:30:44,260 --> 03:30:44,960
No good cooldowns.

4665
03:30:45,060 --> 03:30:45,460
No good cooldown.

4666
03:30:46,020 --> 03:30:46,580
Yeah, it's good.

4667
03:30:47,380 --> 03:30:47,860
Don't don't hit him.

4668
03:30:47,940 --> 03:30:49,280
Don't hit him in the bunker, please.

4669
03:30:49,740 --> 03:30:51,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4670
03:30:51,380 --> 03:30:52,280
Okay, I can go on rocket.

4671
03:30:52,460 --> 03:30:53,840
I'm dead here.

4672
03:30:53,840 --> 03:30:54,020
I'm dead.

4673
03:30:54,020 --> 03:30:56,800
Break it, break it, break it, break it, break it, break it,
break it.

4674
03:30:56,960 --> 03:30:57,640
I'm dead here.

4675
03:30:58,020 --> 03:30:58,560
I'm living for you.

4676
03:30:58,700 --> 03:30:58,780
I'm living.

4677
03:31:00,460 --> 03:31:01,140
I can reheat.

4678
03:31:01,280 --> 03:31:01,540
I can reheat.

4679
03:31:02,100 --> 03:31:02,620
I can reheat.

4680
03:31:02,620 --> 03:31:03,240
I can reheat.

4681
03:31:03,240 --> 03:31:04,280
Do I have to set up TB?

4682
03:31:05,280 --> 03:31:06,700
Maybe when it will actually, maybe when it will.

4683
03:31:06,740 --> 03:31:07,340
They pulled you.

4684
03:31:07,860 --> 03:31:10,140

03:31:13,880 --> 03:31:14,240
I don't know.

4688
03:31:14,240 --> 03:31:15,160
He's actually in the other one.

4689
03:31:16,440 --> 03:31:17,060
It's on TP.

4690
03:31:19,260 --> 03:31:20,020

03:31:25,520 --> 03:31:26,000

4696
03:31:26,580 --> 03:31:28,140

Okay, I'll go die.

4761
03:33:30,360 --> 03:33:31,160
Try to live, try to live.

4762
03:33:32,160 --> 03:33:32,980
I'm trying to.

4763
03:33:36,420 --> 03:33:37,560
I can't go with my health care.

4764
03:33:37,720 --> 03:33:38,220
Yeah, I'm back.

4765
03:33:38,360 --> 03:33:38,480

03:33:39,560 --> 03:33:39,960
Hello, bottom right.

4768
03:33:40,020 --> 03:33:40,360
Butter's off.

4769
03:33:42,420 --> 03:33:43,230
I got two.

4770
03:33:54,520 --> 03:33:59,100
But they used it.

4771
03:34:00,720 --> 03:34:03,640
Wait, wait take poke, poke, poke for a cloak.

4772
03:34:03,720 --> 03:34:04,500
They only have invisids!

4773
03:34:05,160 --> 03:34:06,360
I'm taking damage for invis.

4774
03:34:06,680 --> 03:34:07,400
I mean, four cloak.

4775
03:34:07,880 --> 03:34:08,440
Yeah, yeah, I'm taking damage.

4776
03:34:09,380 --> 03:34:10,620
I can get bowed easy.

4777
03:34:12,220 --> 03:34:29,080

4780
03:34:43,240 --> 03:34:43,900
I can't shoot him.

4781
03:34:51,590 --> 03:34:52,810
I'll set up deeply.

4782
03:34:56,890 --> 03:34:59,010
That's kind of where we need Phoenix ult, to be honest.

4783
03:34:59,670 --> 03:35:00,130
That's okay.

4784
03:35:00,830 --> 03:35:01,950
We used to fight before.

4785
03:35:02,130 --> 03:35:02,810
We had good setup.

4786
03:35:03,050 --> 03:35:05,390
I think I played this speedily and then we just went.

4787
03:35:06,290 --> 03:35:08,510
No, I think if we play this, we just actually, we just went.

4788
03:35:09,750 --> 03:35:11,350
I think we should have just played for Cloak Hult.

4789
03:35:12,530 --> 03:35:13,370
For Cloak Hult?

4790
03:35:13,650 --> 03:35:16,170
I mean, it was, I don't think so.

4791
03:35:16,230 --> 03:35:18,430
I think it was just lucky that we didn't die for.

4792
03:35:18,510 --> 03:35:20,490
They should have just killed us.

4793
03:35:20,610 --> 03:35:22,630
I don't know how I lived there.

4794
03:35:23,710 --> 03:35:26,870
I mean the damage reduction, 20% on Deadpool helped you live
there.

4795
03:35:27,070 --> 03:35:27,750
Oh shit, thanks.

4796
03:35:28,810 --> 03:35:29,030
Yeah.

4797
03:35:29,430 --> 03:35:33,090
I mean, it doesn't change the fact that we still had a bad
situation though.

4798
03:35:45,560 --> 03:35:47,240
You look at how we lost the fight.

4799
03:35:47,460 --> 03:35:48,780
There's multiple fights we could have won.

4800
03:35:49,780 --> 03:35:52,420
That was crazy that I lived still.

4801
03:35:55,680 --> 03:35:56,540
That's unlucky.

4802
03:35:57,460 --> 03:36:03,860
yeah him dying there there's nothing we could do you got to
agree so i always saved my old for rocket i feel like i had

4803
03:36:03,860 --> 03:36:13,340
to you can you can use aggressive too but i mean what do i
say it's like when you have wood you can like flank with it

4804
03:36:13,340 --> 03:36:21,180
if you want but in the last fight in example if we're all
playing to hit then we need like a structured hit we need

4805
03:36:21,180 --> 03:36:29,240
everyone there kind of and it'd be not so aggressive with
cloak i was like i'm going all the way in now i was like you

4806
03:36:29,240 --> 03:36:34,740
could have flanked that fight and you couldn't just like you
need to shoot the squids as well moxie more often i was like

4807
03:36:34,740 --> 03:36:42,320
i'm going all in and i'm like oopsie yeah it's on the far
left like do i play far right maybe i shouldn't have done

4808
03:36:42,320 --> 03:36:48,780
but when we set up a play when we set up a play it wasn't
development yeah then you can't just like flank and hit with

4809
03:36:48,780 --> 03:36:57,740
us no and then once the hit is done you just go back i don't
think even if i didn't do it too deep i think like if i

4810
03:36:57,740 --> 03:37:06,080
didn't do that it didn't matter we always try to stay in too
long it's okay as soon as our hit is out we have zero chance

4811
03:37:06,080 --> 03:37:11,480
of confirming the kill then we need to get the next best
thing out of it which is draining resources preventing them

4812
03:37:11,480 --> 03:37:25,840
i don't think like we would have won even if i did not go
deep that's kind of sad there's so much maybe we should have

4813
03:37:25,840 --> 03:37:27,220
paid engaged last fight speedily

4814
03:37:30,600 --> 03:37:39,020
yeah last five last five is my bad i just rolled yeah it's
kind of annoying yeah like they use all their resources to

4815
03:37:39,020 --> 03:37:43,340
try and kill me and it didn't work but we still lost it it's
pretty good

4816
03:37:51,330 --> 03:37:57,650
but yeah definitely i think like even if i if i like got
back to my team if i didn't alt that team i don't think it

4817
03:37:57,650 --> 03:38:03,370
would have changed anything i think we were i think we were
regardless list.

4818
03:38:03,490 --> 03:38:08,350
Because I think if I, like, alted back to my team, Namer
would have just altered our team.

4819
03:38:08,510 --> 03:38:10,250
Our entire team instead of alting me.

4820
03:38:10,630 --> 03:38:12,890
And then that would have killed all of us in general.

4821
03:38:19,750 --> 03:38:22,410
Like, he just solo altered me and I was still alive.

4822
03:38:23,170 --> 03:38:24,310
So I think that, yeah.

4823
03:38:25,510 --> 03:38:26,690
That Jeffskin, which one?

4824
03:38:26,930 --> 03:38:27,250
This one?

4825
03:38:27,390 --> 03:38:28,530
Oh, yeah, it's the Pixel one.

4826
03:38:29,110 --> 03:38:29,410
It's weird.

4827
03:38:29,410 --> 03:38:29,610
It's weird.

4828
03:38:29,710 --> 03:38:30,070
It's weird, right?

4829
03:38:30,190 --> 03:38:31,270
Today doesn't matter as well.

4830
03:38:31,570 --> 03:38:32,470
Tomorrow's more important.

4831
03:38:32,490 --> 03:38:32,850
Yeah.

4832
03:38:33,110 --> 03:38:37,790
you know now we know what they play it actually doesn't
matter you know pressure doesn't really create diamonds

4833
03:38:37,790 --> 03:38:45,390
today is only sitting yeah it's only seating it's only
bracket we still have one more team to fight and then we're

4834
03:38:45,390 --> 03:38:55,290
good to go we can disperse do we know what team no um i mean
look they haven't oh yeah they haven't said anything in the

4835
03:38:55,290 --> 03:39:01,370
captain chat i think we play against the nexus team now yeah
i think that's the last thing we haven't played

4836
03:39:05,630 --> 03:39:07,930
Like we have our own group, right?

4837
03:39:09,070 --> 03:39:11,470
Do we versus the people in the other bracket?

4838
03:39:12,470 --> 03:39:13,250
Yeah, I think so.

4839
03:39:18,830 --> 03:39:20,330
Who's winning in the other bracket?

4840
03:39:20,790 --> 03:39:21,110
The flats?

4841
03:39:23,870 --> 03:39:25,370
We don't know.

4842
03:39:28,170 --> 03:39:28,930
Probably is.

4843
03:39:30,510 --> 03:39:31,570
Seems pretty good.

4844
03:39:34,750 --> 03:39:35,390
Um...

4845
03:39:40,190 --> 03:39:57,410
yeah they fell held um and they were against uh they were
against sk's team i see such

4846
03:40:02,330 --> 03:40:10,590
an eights matchups really they just have everything against
us emma grab thing's done namor i guess i shouldn't bet

4847
03:40:10,590 --> 03:40:18,510
cloak the cloak band is not worth it i think but the angela
band is good i think we need i don't think they can't play

4848
03:40:18,510 --> 03:40:25,030
phoenix against us like this i really think if i played that
earlier yeah i think like i honestly think like i'd rather

4849
03:40:25,030 --> 03:40:35,410
play against phoenix than i mean at least for that team like
i think like being leaving phoenix open is fine do we still

4850
03:40:35,410 --> 03:40:41,970
want to let's change it it's always the uncirculated 50
damage from the squid that just kills us that's like so hard

4851
03:40:41,970 --> 03:40:51,390
one more game and And then we're all free.

4852
03:40:52,530 --> 03:40:53,450
I can't wait for next.

4853
03:40:53,630 --> 03:40:53,950
Okay, next.

4854
03:40:54,130 --> 03:40:55,050
Actually, next week.

4855
03:40:55,410 --> 03:40:55,970
Next two weeks.

4856
03:40:56,790 --> 03:40:58,290
I'm going to be so stressed out.

4857
03:40:58,810 --> 03:41:00,010
There's so much stuff.

4858
03:41:00,250 --> 03:41:01,390
Jeff, I'm still like, go for dive.

4859
03:41:01,670 --> 03:41:04,090
But we have, like, Mantis instead of, like, Phoenix or
something like that.

4860
03:41:04,750 --> 03:41:05,030
Wow.

4861
03:41:05,150 --> 03:41:08,230
And if they don't, and if they, but, like, instead of, like,
last saving Jeff.

4862
03:41:08,330 --> 03:41:10,090
That's why we had no schedule for this week.

4863
03:41:10,410 --> 03:41:12,030
This is literally a free-for-all.

4864
03:41:12,190 --> 03:41:13,130
I agree to that.

4865
03:41:13,510 --> 03:41:17,670
But, like, it sucks because, like, my cough is so bad the
last two days.

4866
03:41:18,050 --> 03:41:18,250
Yeah.

4867
03:41:18,550 --> 03:41:20,490
Or we can still play dive, but instead of Phoenix, we can
go.

4868
03:41:20,510 --> 03:41:28,170
mantis triple support with jeff yeah i see like with the
coffee it makes me so tired throughout the day because like

4869
03:41:28,170 --> 03:41:35,470
i've been like coughing myself awake and also like i'm just
like i know we can't just play what we played earlier like

4870
03:41:35,470 --> 03:41:44,730
hawk and triple mantis so it's like not great and it comes
and goes too because it's like it's like i would be okay

4871
03:41:44,730 --> 03:41:51,290
like if we had played three days ago and then suddenly i get
hit hard and then like the cough was so bad i was like

4872
03:41:54,010 --> 03:42:08,770
literally like it was not hot it was it was not the hot kind
of coffee i don't even know you can make it hot it was like

4873
03:42:08,770 --> 03:42:20,310
it's like when i'm coffee a hairball out yeah like i was
copying i was like yeah we need to punish the enemy yeah it

4874
03:42:20,310 --> 03:42:31,010
was not great it was not great yeah and then like and it was
like i believe angela is this good against full dive bro

4875
03:42:31,010 --> 03:42:41,050
trust me trust me who's we yeah is it me what i mean who's
we where you say shoot them more like with my gun no no we

4876
03:42:41,050 --> 03:42:46,210
need to push them more so they force resources like hella
bird and name or shift and then we need to kill them confirm

4877
03:42:46,210 --> 03:42:54,530
afterwards you know everyone needs to be yeah and then like
always not having the best time needs to go in with clap you

4878
03:42:54,530 --> 03:43:01,750
know whenever you have clap you play aggro and then you try
to one shot with clap and try to help us you know because we

4879
03:43:01,750 --> 03:43:10,770
want to get healed yeah we want to do damage at the same
time every time we dive i try to clap when no one when no

4880
03:43:10,770 --> 03:43:18,450
one in the enemy is meeting you in main then you want to
develop on the map and help us stage a hit right by hitting

4881
03:43:18,450 --> 03:43:24,730
the enemy hella hitting the name because you force a
situation where he doesn't have resources and you have

4882
03:43:24,730 --> 03:43:42,630
resources okay so basically i pull i so basically i don't
play main if they're not on cap or or something they're not

4883
03:43:42,630 --> 03:43:45,610
on cap yeah i mean If you don't have to touch card, then you
can develop.

4884
03:43:47,210 --> 03:43:50,290
Like, if they have no one to touch the card, you can just
help us in the dive.

4885
03:43:53,290 --> 03:43:54,330
Risky business, alright.

4886
03:43:55,590 --> 03:44:00,750
Even if they have someone to touch card, you still want to
play the high ground to give you the best opportunities, no?

4887
03:44:01,810 --> 03:44:03,710
Like, if they have...

4888
03:44:03,710 --> 03:44:08,010
Like, an example of the last map, you could have played the
high ground every fight, and it's very hard for them to

4889
03:44:08,010 --> 03:44:08,070
overcome.

4890
03:44:08,090 --> 03:44:08,610
On second point?

4891
03:44:09,270 --> 03:44:09,830
Yeah, yeah.

4892
03:44:10,190 --> 03:44:11,270
I feel like I was, dude.

4893
03:44:11,290 --> 03:44:11,850
You gotta watch it.

4894
03:44:13,790 --> 03:44:18,810
yeah when i have a cop make it to you how hard i need to do
some nice help and suddenly in the super chat thank you

4895
03:44:18,810 --> 03:44:25,370
thank you yeah every time i just make it once and then like
i can't do much about it just because you know you should

4896
03:44:25,370 --> 03:44:32,430
have infinite opportunities to i don't really i can't really
go go out yeah i don't think i was doing that well on attack

4897
03:44:32,430 --> 03:44:41,250
after i drink my tea as ggs it's over we just gotta watch
back and tell me look we can do that i don't mind doing that

4898
03:44:41,250 --> 03:44:51,410
after the next game or we can do it now if you want but
thank you super chat thingy thank you i even had the the

4899
03:44:51,410 --> 03:44:59,090
more is the card on stream the it's not like it's not the
black liquid just the chinese black liquid for yourself i

4900
03:44:59,090 --> 03:45:06,170
even had that i take it every day otherwise we just and then
the game right you just have infinite pressure on us like

4901
03:45:06,170 --> 03:45:13,630
here on second point you mean right i hope so too i hate it
defense i think one was what what's what's the longest i've

4902
03:45:13,630 --> 03:45:21,090
had the cough for guys now we need to watch the fight after
yeah paypal go we have a setup once the longest i've had the

4903
03:45:21,090 --> 03:45:27,470
cough because i've always had these coughs they kept my
record so it's fine if you play the high ground what's my

4904
03:45:27,470 --> 03:45:36,630
current record we already poke so like this situation
example in our matchup is pretty bad because look we have

4905
03:45:36,630 --> 03:45:43,310
five people that want to play for a hit and you already poke
so you need to like chill more wait for the hit and then you

4906
03:45:43,310 --> 03:45:54,790
keep it was a half of you know don't say that like don't
like one hp no don't say that how are we going yeah i'm

4907
03:45:54,790 --> 03:46:01,510
definitely not recovering with me screaming opportunity to
kill hella you see and now you can't do that because you afk

4908
03:46:01,510 --> 03:46:07,090
oh my god there's no way i had it for half a year we were
just normal right which happened there's no way you see no

4909
03:46:07,090 --> 03:46:15,850
it's with filtered water this time i got a filter I bought
like those filters Then you wait then you walk in this area

4910
03:46:15,850 --> 03:46:22,290
then you fire a stun in then we have a stun with us Oh,
yeah, but that was when during the phantom beat concert I

4911
03:46:22,290 --> 03:46:28,110
literally accidentally got back-to-back sick I like
accidentally I like went to rehearsal.

4912
03:46:28,410 --> 03:46:29,490
I think I don't remember.

4913
03:46:29,990 --> 03:46:38,630
I went to rehearsal at Atlanta and then I got sick from it
We want to hit again Like I was about to recover and then I

4914
03:46:38,630 --> 03:46:44,070
got double sick and then it like fucked me up But it's kind
of the same thing you see you you want to poke about too

4915
03:46:44,070 --> 03:46:51,690
much when you just should hide or take top Yeah, I was
playing on the back on the back damage, you know, like yeah,

4916
03:46:51,830 --> 03:46:56,210
but that's like Pokemon They have hello name or and you
don't have resources for it I think it's like in example

4917
03:46:56,210 --> 03:47:01,490
could be if we have Loki on the high ground too here Then
Loki can heal you on the high ground But then people would

4918
03:47:01,490 --> 03:47:07,570
have to play further up the fact that we don't have that and
the fact that like our only support is Togibird and she's in

4919
03:47:07,570 --> 03:47:09,330
main right now not on the high ground.

4920
03:47:09,390 --> 03:47:12,810
He's gonna heal you if you take damage So just the same
thing happens now.

4921
03:47:12,890 --> 03:47:18,630
If you take damage here, now our stun for the hit is gone
and you take damage, so now you can't fight.

4922
03:47:19,190 --> 03:47:20,370
And now we want to hit, right?

4923
03:47:20,790 --> 03:47:21,630
So just the same thing.

4924
03:47:21,730 --> 03:47:23,890
If you were with us here, no one will shoot you.

4925
03:47:23,890 --> 03:47:24,830
They can't develop on the map.

4926
03:47:25,290 --> 03:47:26,210
Then they go bottom here.

4927
03:47:26,550 --> 03:47:29,730
Then we have a killbox to hit here because then you can take
with us.

4928
03:47:30,190 --> 03:47:31,690
Now you can't do that, you see?

4929
03:47:33,190 --> 03:47:39,190
Now we go in, and you have no control on the map because you
didn't play for it.

4930
03:47:39,190 --> 03:47:46,110
you see so now we have to make which is fine you know and
then the same thing would apply now now we kind of need a

4931
03:47:46,110 --> 03:47:53,970
play because they're going to have ultimates so either we
match it or we kite it so either you go in like and take an

4932
03:47:53,970 --> 03:48:02,650
angle go here and match the angle of i'm gonna grab water
i'll be right back take the i finished another and try to

4933
03:48:02,650 --> 03:48:09,330
hit from behind because now you're in the same position
where the enemy hella can take you in his advantage you on

4934
03:48:09,330 --> 03:48:14,850
the high ground because both of you should just drop up here
right both of you should re-rotate the fact that you guys on

4935
03:48:14,850 --> 03:48:21,110
the high ground is just going to put pressure on all of us
which prevents us from hitting right so now they now they

4936
03:48:21,110 --> 03:48:26,550
want to walk up and we're still on the high ground and no
one can play as long as we don't have winnie develop in the

4937
03:48:26,550 --> 03:48:33,110
backline right now and jeff pierce like everyone is stopped
from development and we have three people like afk this is

4938
03:48:33,110 --> 03:48:40,110
the same thing when they have angela afk in the sense of you
guys get poked now then we hit and then you on collapse on

4939
03:48:40,110 --> 03:48:47,970
that look now we want to hit right but now you peek too
early so you once again in the same cycle where you can't

4940
03:48:47,970 --> 03:48:55,310
hit with us so now you just play to live and you die entry
because of that if you had played to live earlier and we

4941
03:48:55,310 --> 03:49:01,170
kite to kite to ulterior right because it was obvious they
were gonna do that then we have a situation after where we

4942
03:49:01,170 --> 03:49:10,030
can hit right and where we can win after now the situation
is not there so it's like super i'm listening broken it too

4943
03:49:10,030 --> 03:49:20,130
this is good like i really like the that deadpool ult by the
way speedily we always killed inverse it's so opi yeah this

4944
03:49:20,130 --> 03:49:25,090
was a very close situation fight here like this was winnable
and then the next fight moxie you just came back and you

4945
03:49:25,090 --> 03:49:33,270
died with ult i'm pretty sure no i didn't have all i was
like oh yeah it was like it was like well it was like yeah

4946
03:49:33,270 --> 03:49:38,810
yeah we say we have touch so you need to respect it and you
just take the opposite side go behind them and just shoot

4947
03:49:39,190 --> 03:49:45,010
then they have to match it if you shoot the if you go here
no one can control you just develop to the high ground here

4948
03:49:45,010 --> 03:49:55,930
go here and then you just shoot here forever with right hand
peak check check check go in just chill

4949
03:50:00,450 --> 03:50:09,370
also guys the server is up by the way that's good yeah but
these are like all the same fights though it's like legit

4950
03:50:09,370 --> 03:50:16,830
the same thing i did my captain job second point for so long
we really have to respect the enemy's position more i did my

4951
03:50:16,830 --> 03:50:25,870
job as captain we want to go in take the high ground from
them instantly clocked in you should get infinite thank you

4952
03:50:25,870 --> 03:50:33,850
i'm a very good captain now we have your job done job done
probably have to look back at job done this fight is more

4953
03:50:33,850 --> 03:50:39,790
important because we had good momentum here this is a fight
where i kind of would want to go at least not allow them to

4954
03:50:39,790 --> 03:50:47,770
play for free on point no you should definitely be on the
high ground already because now you take too long to take it

4955
03:50:47,770 --> 03:50:53,390
once again you play low ground you should be on the high
ground here yeah motivational speech stand the top here we

4956
03:50:53,390 --> 03:51:00,810
got look at the thing that we would have okay day one
doesn't matter we are just sad bagging guys we're just

4957
03:51:00,810 --> 03:51:09,650
giving them fake straps we're giving them comps that we're
definitely not playing tomorrow right the hell much longer

4958
03:51:09,650 --> 03:51:15,330
because these guys need to spend more time on healing each
other so we can stay in their backline much longer now that

4959
03:51:15,330 --> 03:51:21,970
we don't have a stun both me and speedily take way more
damage and I die for it right this is like the situation

4960
03:51:21,970 --> 03:51:29,870
right we just play too passive and it's the same thing here
too we want to hit and Doki needs to clap you clap a bit too

4961
03:51:29,870 --> 03:51:36,310
late and you don't clap us you should walk forward and clap
us because then when we hit here right same with Jeff

4962
03:51:36,310 --> 03:51:41,770
Pierce, we actually have a situation where we can stay in
the enemy backline longer forcing more resources from them

4963
03:51:41,770 --> 03:51:48,750
giving you guys more time to clear the people on point or
DAP to clear people on point and this is like every single

4964
03:51:48,750 --> 03:52:01,030
donkey bird mansion I didn't do my job like I just die and
we just lose even though we had two entry picks situation so

4965
03:52:01,030 --> 03:52:08,990
we let the guard move like like alone it's okay if we let
the card move alone if we want to clear i think clearing

4966
03:52:08,990 --> 03:52:17,010
here is more important so i think it's okay to let it move
uh so i definitely feel quite sad that i like die here i

4967
03:52:17,010 --> 03:52:24,410
don't know where winnie is on the opposite side of the map
yeah it's kind of mistimed it's kind of unlucky what i i get

4968
03:52:24,410 --> 03:52:32,670
in the i'm in the die so like now i feel like winnie you
shouldn't have went back i've never played yeah i think it's

4969
03:52:32,670 --> 03:52:40,910
curious about like i like keep going forward i like played
so much non-dive in rank because n a doesn't do dive this is

4970
03:52:40,910 --> 03:52:48,610
like always good for us nr doesn't do dive so i have no dive
experience at all this is like every time i play like the

4971
03:52:48,610 --> 03:53:00,190
last the only experience i've ever had would dive is like
literally this and then we like peek a bit i swear i swear i

4972
03:53:00,190 --> 03:53:07,290
like this is like my first time experiencing that and we do
know it away from us should always walk in if we play this

4973
03:53:07,290 --> 03:53:15,510
dive comp and then walk out once you don't have it anymore
but yeah the cloak was where the biggest problem honestly we

4974
03:53:15,510 --> 03:53:21,950
are not planning cloak anymore i think but we definitely no
and they hate that nobody plays dive i think i want to play

4975
03:53:21,950 --> 03:53:27,030
cap and if they have invest and i want to go a lot enough to
pick up so that's why i have like no experience i don't

4976
03:53:27,030 --> 03:53:37,570
really know how i don't have experience with dive because n
a is just bra back two minutes and eight people just like

4977
03:53:37,570 --> 03:53:49,330
the bra so like i'm very used to positioning myself in a bra
bra setting i don't know what the fuck i'm doing i i don't

4978
03:53:49,330 --> 03:53:51,950
know what the fuck i'm doing right now

4979
03:53:56,890 --> 03:54:06,390
i quit i took a break when dive was meta i was like that
shit You know when the support strike was going on?

4980
03:54:06,730 --> 03:54:08,110
I was like fuck that.

4981
03:54:08,250 --> 03:54:09,010
I'm out

4982
03:54:12,150 --> 03:54:19,030
But I was striking not because I felt like I was
underappreciated because you know I've been playing support

4983
03:54:19,030 --> 03:54:21,850
since Overwatch days like we're never gonna get appreciated.

4984
03:54:22,090 --> 03:54:23,130
I've learned that

4985
03:54:26,230 --> 03:54:35,410
I've realized that that that's always gonna be the case So I
was just like but then like but the last draw was when it

4986
03:54:35,410 --> 03:54:46,230
dive was meta and I was like fuck that shit I don't know I'm
playing dynasty warriors I just hate dive it's just not fun

4987
03:54:46,230 --> 03:54:54,330
it's fun for like the tanks and DPS but it's not fucking fun
for the supports you know why everyone's like but dive is so

4988
03:54:54,330 --> 03:55:04,950
fun yeah because you're you know like you're a tank or DPS
you're not on support ain't fun it's fun for the divers

4989
03:55:06,190 --> 03:55:09,970
being dope so i have zero experience playing with dab

4990
03:55:26,690 --> 03:55:35,410
like human torch meta was all right it's better than dab but
i do agree to you winnie i think we can save mantis last

4991
03:55:35,410 --> 03:55:41,850
year we also have a better opportunity you can do it
tomorrow okay because they also feel like we should play on

4992
03:55:41,850 --> 03:55:47,110
mox as a strength like if he wants to like play hawk eye i
think it's a little bit on hawk I'll just put him on

4993
03:55:47,110 --> 03:55:47,630
something comfortable.

4994
03:55:47,850 --> 03:55:49,070
He gets to play Hawkeye!

4995
03:55:51,910 --> 03:55:52,130
Yeah!

4996
03:55:53,310 --> 03:55:54,690
I'm down to just like keep playing that.

4997
03:55:54,930 --> 03:55:56,090
At least we're getting better on it.

4998
03:55:56,190 --> 03:55:58,050
He gets to play Hawkeye!

4999
03:55:58,210 --> 03:55:59,770
I mean, the problem is like our old cycle.

5000
03:56:00,370 --> 03:56:04,190
Like, I think if we just...

5001
03:56:04,190 --> 03:56:09,970
It's like we force out their support also, like, we need,
like, another, like, old combo or, like, another old that

5002
03:56:09,970 --> 03:56:11,650
can, like, guarantee like, a fight with.

5003
03:56:11,790 --> 03:56:12,270
Oh, my God.

5004
03:56:12,350 --> 03:56:13,850
He actually gets to play his character.

5005
03:56:14,890 --> 03:56:24,330
Maybe we try to like they they always support my my dd all
but then be like nothing after that yeah maybe we can try

5006
03:56:24,330 --> 03:56:32,330
against these guys to put mox on dd and then you can play
silo or star or star yeah yeah because i agree like if we

5007
03:56:32,330 --> 03:56:44,980
just have like another dps all which is like kill through
every single time yeah one day he will play spider-man one

5008
03:56:44,980 --> 03:57:18,970
day I'm back Welcome Matt Welcome back Thank you Moxie you
get to play Hawkeye Yeah you think so Yeah they just said Oh

5009
03:57:18,970 --> 03:57:39,030
never mind Oh come on Dude Matchup Matchup man Sorry I
baited you Fuck So you don't want my Spider-Man i broke it i

5010
03:57:39,030 --> 03:57:49,970
let him hope i let him hope for one second don't do this
thing it's very good though yeah but you're coordinated with

5011
03:57:49,970 --> 03:57:57,890
the trust me dives yeah but i think like it'll be good if
like we have like like another like guaranteed fight win or

5012
03:57:57,890 --> 03:58:03,190
like a star we can test it out for this game yeah we can
play at this game yeah

5013
03:58:06,330 --> 03:58:15,530
when will we see his spider-man though i know you guys said
it's good no i also think phoenix was it's pretty good

5014
03:58:15,530 --> 03:58:22,490
though i think it's like that's not spider-man trust me how
much are you not playing me on spider-man because it's bad

5015
03:58:22,490 --> 03:58:31,190
or because you think i'm bad on it i think it's just not
that good and too kept like we're not killing the captain

5016
03:58:31,190 --> 03:58:39,990
point it just never happens who's supposed to kill the
captain you know check check check the dap does 40 damage

5017
03:58:39,990 --> 03:58:51,190
per hit on mac he will never kill the cap damn he's using
logic against you he used logic against you maxi i'm just

5018
03:58:51,190 --> 03:58:52,190
just wondering

5019
03:58:55,210 --> 03:58:57,490
but i'm getting the idea of the phoenix now

5020
03:59:01,810 --> 03:59:08,150
you know his numbers it's over i don't know it feels like i
always need like when they're running like hello or

5021
03:59:08,150 --> 03:59:22,870
something i guess you guys go okay you got german german
efficiency right there but if you want to if you want to run

5022
03:59:22,870 --> 03:59:28,310
me on daredevil on koth i'm down to that because it's called
yes

5023
03:59:35,540 --> 03:59:42,780
snake case venom ban yeah i think they've gotten banned

5024
03:59:45,860 --> 03:59:56,470
venom well they've been protecting the venom wait drp give
trust the captain role you have captain

5025
04:00:00,350 --> 04:00:08,670
see guys i know this at this time job done protect venom
every game and then last protect spider-man job done i did

5026
04:00:08,670 --> 04:00:09,230
my job

5027
04:00:13,350 --> 04:00:20,650
oh we play triple but then we need to ban venom he's also
playing but he's also playing daredevil I don't think I'm

5028
04:00:20,650 --> 04:00:22,890
going to be like double negative in a rank.

5029
04:00:23,690 --> 04:00:26,410
Yeah, no, the interval on ping is so hard.

5030
04:00:27,410 --> 04:00:30,170
Like, you can't even react at all.

5031
04:00:30,850 --> 04:00:32,950
Because I don't think we got broadcast at all.

5032
04:00:34,710 --> 04:00:38,810
I think it's the only interview that broadcast matches and
we're not good enough.

5033
04:00:42,210 --> 04:00:44,610
They're like, this ain't cool.

5034
04:00:44,870 --> 04:00:48,310
This ain't, these matches aren't sick enough.

5035
04:00:49,630 --> 04:01:08,860
for you dying here I need to lock in yeah it is yeah good
yeah I'm gonna try my router I bought a router now I bought

5036
04:01:08,860 --> 04:01:17,140
a router that I hopefully can connect to my old router and
then from the old router I only use the telephones like the

5037
04:01:17,140 --> 04:01:26,440
telephone numbers and then from the new route I use the
internet and that would bro you Thomas Edison what the fuck

5038
04:01:26,440 --> 04:01:38,000
no chat GPT told me it might work so I'm gonna try it out
what else do I do otherwise I have to play with leg every

5039
04:01:38,000 --> 04:01:47,280
single 10 minutes and that's rough buddy it's pretty bad for
a pro what's your what's your speed the speed is not the

5040
04:01:47,280 --> 04:01:53,280
problem it's more like the fact that I have package loss
like every second and at one point it just becomes too much

5041
04:01:53,280 --> 04:02:01,100
so i have like one second leg every 10 minutes that's bad
yeah this is bad like it loses a fight in one of 100 fights

5042
04:02:01,100 --> 04:02:11,600
it's just lost because of it which they want you someone say
no all right we don't do no eu person says say no represent

5043
04:02:11,600 --> 04:02:14,110
yeah yeah that's it

5044
04:02:23,400 --> 04:02:31,960
holy we did it we denied their rights yeah fucking go

5045
04:02:35,600 --> 04:02:52,060
let's go the EU ain't good yeah see I had to have an EU
person say no you know it makes more sense an eu person say

5046
04:02:52,060 --> 04:03:04,780
no because then they're like oh you know like it's their own
kind like their own kind oppressed them not me you know so

5047
04:03:04,780 --> 04:03:14,320
it does yeah so it doesn't sound racist when an na person
says no exactly you know it exactly doesn't look as bad when

5048
04:03:14,320 --> 04:03:22,180
an na person unlike the long range one i think you're
playing air double buddy Oh shit.

5049
04:03:22,960 --> 04:03:24,440
I think so too.

5050
04:03:25,260 --> 04:03:27,540
It really be one of your own exactly.

5051
04:03:27,860 --> 04:03:30,160
Trust me, I feel you don't know my hero pool well enough,
dude.

5052
04:03:31,900 --> 04:03:33,500
I think I just play cap, huh?

5053
04:03:34,320 --> 04:03:35,120
I know you play me.

5054
04:03:35,240 --> 04:03:36,200
You have a mean wolf.

5055
04:03:37,340 --> 04:03:37,740
But...

5056
04:03:37,740 --> 04:03:38,700
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

5057
04:03:39,480 --> 04:03:40,560
Wait, since when?

04:04:23,420 --> 04:04:24,720
I was just a supporter.

5070
04:04:26,340 --> 04:04:27,020
I think Didi.

5071
04:04:27,380 --> 04:04:28,200
I actually think Didi.

5072
04:04:29,440 --> 04:04:30,140
Jeff, okay.

5073
04:04:32,260 --> 04:04:33,580
I think they played Jeff too.

5074
04:04:35,300 --> 04:04:36,960
Oh, we have Didi, so they can play Jeff.

5075
04:04:39,380 --> 04:04:40,500
And we still have Mantis.

5076
04:04:40,580 --> 04:04:42,540
I think this is the Mantis safe situation, right?

5077
04:04:42,700 --> 04:04:43,520
Yeah, I think so.

5078
04:04:44,060 --> 04:04:45,000
I think so, too.

5079
04:04:45,500 --> 04:04:53,780
good if people ban jeff against us it's just a free net to
save then yeah we've been

on star lord i think they re i think they rewatched that

5084
04:05:43,820 --> 04:05:48,380
particular part where you played star lord Where they were
gathering intel.

5085
04:05:49,100 --> 04:05:49,680
I know.

5086
04:05:50,800 --> 04:05:51,520
Pick your hero.

5087
04:05:51,540 --> 04:05:53,840
Hey, all you do on Starlord, just shoot tanks and then build
your ult.

5088
04:05:55,940 --> 04:05:57,140
You coach me speed.

5089
04:05:57,340 --> 04:05:58,460
Like, fuck, you gotta watch it back.

5090
04:05:58,560 --> 04:05:58,940
What was I doing?

5091
04:05:59,720 --> 04:06:01,520
I don't think he wants, I don't think he kill.

5092
04:06:02,360 --> 04:06:07,560
I mean, for legit anyone, like, you just shoot tanks the
whole game and then Starlord ult.

5093
04:06:09,320 --> 04:06:09,900
I think it's a trivia.

5094
04:06:10,900 --> 04:06:12,260
I think go...

5095
04:06:13,180 --> 04:06:14,260
Go Mantis speed.

5096
04:06:15,660 --> 04:06:16,020
Mantis?

5097
04:06:16,020 --> 04:06:17,540
I think we played, yeah.

5098
04:06:17,600 --> 04:06:18,440
Trooper with Mantis.

5099
04:06:18,780 --> 04:06:20,680
Gonna have to be careful against the Venomoult, though.

5100
04:06:20,780 --> 04:06:21,860
Venomoult's gonna be from DIP.

5101
04:06:22,060 --> 04:06:23,000
Are you here?

5102
04:06:23,460 --> 04:06:23,660
Yep.

5103
04:06:24,220 --> 04:06:25,660
We need to go back, I think.

5104
04:06:27,340 --> 04:06:30,060
Oh, is the worst soccer map on the mall?

5105
04:06:30,300 --> 04:06:31,840
I was gonna say, it's actually not the best.

5106
04:06:31,940 --> 04:06:32,960
Do we go dive here?

5107
04:06:34,580 --> 04:06:34,980
Uh...

5108
04:06:34,980 --> 04:06:35,920
I think we should.

5109
04:06:36,660 --> 04:06:36,760
I think we should.

5110
04:06:36,760 --> 04:06:37,140
That's good, Ivan.

5111
04:06:37,180 --> 04:06:37,720
I think we should.

5112
04:06:37,960 --> 04:06:38,820
Someone's might get going.

5113
04:06:40,020 --> 04:06:41,100
Go Invis Rocket.

5114
04:06:41,180 --> 04:06:42,080
Could have been mine, we would.

5115
04:06:42,920 --> 04:06:43,620
Invis Rocket.

5116
04:06:43,780 --> 04:06:44,240
I think it's...

5117
04:06:44,240 --> 04:06:44,780
Okay.

5118
04:06:45,380 --> 04:06:45,940
It's me?

5119
04:06:47,160 --> 04:06:47,520
Yeah.

5120
04:06:48,060 --> 04:06:49,660
I can also try Luna if you want.

5121
04:06:50,720 --> 04:06:52,280
But it can't be me.

5122
04:06:52,540 --> 04:06:53,420
My mic is good.

5123
04:06:54,180 --> 04:06:56,960
I would say if they played from the back, I would go, you
know, with another theme.

5124
04:06:59,100 --> 04:07:00,180
Is it still echoing?

5125
04:07:00,880 --> 04:07:02,020
It's like, it's like not that bad.

5126
04:07:02,180 --> 04:07:02,560
Don't worry about it.

5127
04:07:03,100 --> 04:07:04,240
Okay, because I muted myself.

5128
04:07:04,400 --> 04:07:06,220
So I don't, if you didn't hear it, then.

5129
04:07:06,400 --> 04:07:08,260
All you need to do is capture the mission area.

5130
04:07:08,840 --> 04:07:09,020
Got it?

5131
04:07:10,200 --> 04:07:10,780

5247
04:10:36,280 --> 04:10:36,620
I'm touching.

5248
04:10:37,020 --> 04:10:37,800
Do we see side or side?

5249
04:10:37,820 --> 04:10:38,260
I'm not sure.

5250
04:10:38,340 --> 04:10:38,760
I'm not sure.

5251
04:10:39,940 --> 04:10:40,300
I'm not sure.

5252
04:10:45,860 --> 04:10:47,240
No supports, no supports.

5253
04:10:47,820 --> 04:10:49,320

04:11:28,500 --> 04:11:29,740
You got an ult, just got an ult.

5284
04:11:29,920 --> 04:11:30,640
Get a bottom right, Maxi.

5285
04:11:30,900 --> 04:11:31,080
I hear you.

5286
04:11:31,520 --> 04:11:32,260
I hear him, kill him.

5287
04:11:32,260 --> 04:11:32,540
No, go.

5288
04:11:32,980 --> 04:11:33,200
Huh?

5289
04:11:35,880 --> 04:11:36,560
Oh, what?

5290
04:11:37,360 --> 04:11:38,680
I threw my o-star.

5291
04:11:40,100 --> 04:11:40,480
Oh, okay.

5292
04:11:40,560 --> 04:11:41,260
I threw him out.

5293
04:11:41,300 --> 04:11:41,700
I thought you were still going to kill.

5294
04:11:42,080 --> 04:11:42,460
Oh, okay.

5295
04:11:42,480 --> 04:11:44,640
They have got venom, Jeff.

5296
04:11:48,400 --> 04:11:49,800
You guys should really kill the Jeff for free.

5297
04:11:50,320 --> 04:11:50,920
For sure.

5298
04:11:51,440 --> 04:11:52,440
I'm always on him.

5299
04:11:53,480 --> 04:11:55,820
Wait, did they...

5300
04:11:55,820 --> 04:11:56,460
Okay, they use Rez.

5301
04:11:56,640 --> 04:11:57,180
Did they have Jeff ult?

5302
04:11:57,480 --> 04:11:57,680
Probably, right?

5303
04:11:57,740 --> 04:11:58,400
I'm with your friend.

5304
04:11:59,460 --> 04:12:01,720
I can't lose.

5305
04:12:01,860 --> 04:12:02,540
You wanna go Jeff?

5306
04:12:03,780 --> 04:12:04,880

5307
04:12:05,180 --> 04:12:06,920
I mean, I don't want to.

5308
04:12:07,080 --> 04:12:07,580
I don't want to point.

5309
04:12:07,580 --> 04:12:07,940
I don't want to point.

5310
04:12:08,060 --> 04:12:08,060
I don't want to point.

5311
04:12:08,080 --> 04:12:08,200
You look?

5312
04:12:08,540 --> 04:12:08,860
Okay, chill.

5313
04:12:09,000 --> 04:12:09,660
I'm gonna get their back claim.

5314
04:12:11,560 --> 04:12:12,360
I'm going back.

5315
04:12:12,540 --> 04:12:13,720
I have to get health back.

5316
04:12:14,040 --> 04:12:14,600
I can go spider.

5317
04:12:14,760 --> 04:12:15,020
I can go spider.

5318
04:12:15,320 --> 04:12:18,060
No, no, no, no.

5319
04:12:18,060 --> 04:12:18,780
We have no supports.

5320
04:12:19,620 --> 04:12:20,660
They killed all of us.

5321
04:12:20,800 --> 04:12:21,200
Venom on a shield.

5322
04:12:21,400 --> 04:12:21,800
Venom on a shield.

5323
04:12:22,020 --> 04:12:26,120
I'm dead.

5324
04:12:26,220 --> 04:12:26,360
I'm dead.

5325
04:12:26,700 --> 04:12:26,980

5327
04:12:31,540 --> 04:12:34,380
I mean, this matchup is winning though, I think, but...

5328
04:12:34,940 --> 04:12:36,040
This feels like so...

5329
04:12:37,300 --> 04:12:37,780
I don't know.

5330
04:12:37,900 --> 04:12:40,480
Should I just be like going on supports the whole time?

5331
04:12:40,680 --> 04:12:41,200
You should be on the jet.

5332
04:12:41,240 --> 04:12:42,620
I think you can kill the jet for free.

We go with Invis first.

5387
04:14:54,580 --> 04:14:56,360

You can go Hawkeye if you want, but it should be fine with
playing.

5515
04:18:53,600 --> 04:18:54,420
I think Hawkeye is good.

5516
04:18:54,980 --> 04:18:57,160
They have a Bucky and a fucking two Cloak folds.

5517
04:18:57,220 --> 04:18:59,560

Yeah, yeah, I can go now.

5521
04:19:04,740 --> 04:19:05,520
They have the hook.

04:19:06,000 --> 04:19:06,040
Go!

5523
04:19:06,740 --> 04:19:09,640
Go out, go out, go out.

Let's go.

5530
04:19:15,660 --> 04:19:16,860
Try to try to think of defense.

5531
04:19:17,020 --> 04:19:21,040
Kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it, lamp,
lamp, lamp, only lamp.

5532
04:19:24,920 --> 04:19:26,460
Oh, that might have been too much.

5533
04:19:27,280 --> 04:19:27,860
It's fine, it's fine.

5534
04:19:28,960 --> 04:19:30,160
Venom got him point, nobody.

5535
04:19:31,440 --> 04:19:32,880
Kill Venom first, kill Venom first.

5536
04:19:34,480 --> 04:19:34,580
Good.

5537
04:19:34,780 --> 04:19:35,420
Let me hit this cloud.

5538
04:19:36,080 --> 04:19:38,320
They have side root, they have side root, copy.

I'm out.

5540

We should get this grub gold.

5541
04:19:44,240 --> 04:19:45,700
I think we have to go really early.

5542
04:19:46,140 --> 04:19:48,520
Yes, yes, don't give them, don't shoot them too much, okay?

5543

04:19:49,240 --> 04:19:49,800
Do you want to go early?

5545
04:19:49,880 --> 04:19:51,140

Nice, nice, nice.

5552
04:20:03,260 --> 04:20:03,480
Live it, live it, live it, live it.

5553

Big wall, big wall.

5554

Venom no cooldown.

5557
04:20:10,080 --> 04:20:11,220

Yay!

5559
04:20:13,180 --> 04:20:14,220
Do it again, do it again.

04:20:14,380 --> 04:20:15,160
Go early again.

5561
04:20:15,260 --> 04:20:16,700
They have a cloak hold this time, okay?

5562
04:20:16,940 --> 04:20:17,400

5632
04:22:09,140 --> 04:22:11,820
I was waiting for the stagger with my right click.

5633
04:22:11,980 --> 04:22:13,300

Okay, I can believe you.

04:22:19,960 --> 04:22:20,220
That's it.

5637
04:22:21,000 --> 04:22:22,140

5638
04:22:23,200 --> 04:22:23,940
There you go.

5639
04:22:25,580 --> 04:22:27,260
Now this cupboard is bugged as fuck.

5640
04:22:33,490 --> 04:22:35,710
We're the better dive team, guys.

5641
04:22:35,750 --> 04:22:37,910
Well, I can't tell if you were trolling or not if you think

04:22:41,890 --> 04:22:43,670
I did nothing but that's me!

5644
04:22:43,850 --> 04:22:44,830
Wait, didn't she live though?

5645
04:22:45,450 --> 04:22:45,890
No, she died.

5646
04:22:46,470 --> 04:22:46,830
Or did you kill her?

5647
04:22:47,230 --> 04:22:48,350
That's me, guys!

5648
04:22:51,970 --> 04:22:53,070

Let's go!

5652
04:22:56,810 --> 04:22:57,850
The whale hit like four people.

5653
04:22:58,510 --> 04:22:59,830
I swear it was the whale hit like four people.

5654
04:22:59,830 --> 04:23:00,550
I swear it was the Angela's shield, to be honest.

5655
04:23:00,650 --> 04:23:01,710
That's crazy that you guys live.

5656
04:23:01,710 --> 04:23:04,190
I don't even know how you guys live that.

5657
04:23:04,510 --> 04:23:04,830
Oh,

5658
04:23:08,490 --> 04:23:08,590

5659
04:23:09,230 --> 04:23:11,450
Wait, did it block the Venomal for like everyone?

5660
04:23:11,910 --> 04:23:12,590
Yeah, I think so.

5661
04:23:12,850 --> 04:23:13,970
Wow, that's crazy.

5662
04:23:14,870 --> 04:23:15,710
Yeah, I don't know what...

5663
04:23:15,710 --> 04:23:16,410
We would have definitely died.

5664
04:23:16,630 --> 04:23:18,370
No, there was also an Indus shield though.

5665
04:23:19,430 --> 04:23:21,590
But if we actually kite sooner that fight, we just win.

5666
04:23:22,130 --> 04:23:23,510
Like we had like a good setup again.

5667
04:23:23,610 --> 04:23:25,890
We just need to be expecting it more.

5668
04:23:26,590 --> 04:23:29,150
Like we play to force something, then we get out and then we
hit again.

5669
04:23:29,590 --> 04:23:30,630
Oh yeah, you did kill the SIE.

04:26:22,460 --> 04:26:27,400
up right if we set up for a hit then everyone's got to set
up for the hit you know especially if they have no

5689
04:26:27,400 --> 04:26:33,720
development at one point someone has to touch but dap can
always touch the the squids do make it easier so like if

5928
04:39:24,520 --> 04:39:26,260
Angie one, Angie one, Angie one, Angie one, Angie one, Angie
one.

5929
04:39:26,260 --> 04:39:28,280
Hit the left, hit the left.

5930
04:39:28,800 --> 04:39:29,800
Shoot them, shoot them, shoot them, shoot them.

5931
04:39:29,920 --> 04:39:30,900
I'm trying to get you.

5932
04:39:31,080 --> 04:39:32,280
It's right about one, it's right one, it's right one.

5933
04:39:32,720 --> 04:39:33,120
Multi-multi?

5934
04:39:33,640 --> 04:39:34,420
I can't, I can't.

5935
04:39:34,860 --> 04:39:35,760
Venom, Venom, Venom, Venom.

5936
04:39:35,780 --> 04:39:36,700
Hot, Venom Heart, vote.

5937
04:39:37,300 --> 04:39:38,400
No ,女, wait.

5938
04:39:39,540 --> 04:39:40,240
Boxing you first right.

5939
04:39:40,440 --> 04:39:40,760
I'll mend this.

5940
04:39:40,860 --> 04:39:41,380
I'll mend this.

5941
04:39:41,520 --> 04:39:42,600
I'll make it.

5942
04:39:43,820 --> 04:39:48,600
I miss the slot, Invis andے's low.

5943
04:39:49,240 --> 04:39:50,120
Man, I cannot.

5944
04:39:50,380 --> 04:39:50,780
Don't, don't, don't.

5945
04:39:50,780 --> 04:39:54,340
I'm broken, I'll dead, I will be dead, I'm on.

5946
04:39:54,840 --> 04:39:57,940
Uh, Venom, Venom is behind us.

5947
04:39:57,940 --> 04:39:58,460
Venom low, Venom!

5948
04:39:58,680 --> 04:39:59,340
I have the heals, I have the heals.

5949
04:39:59,340 --> 04:39:59,420
I have a heal.

5950
04:39:59,740 --> 04:40:00,740
Venom low, Venom one.

5951
04:40:02,120 --> 04:40:05,760
Oh, he got the res, so he saw the way back.

5952
04:40:05,780 --> 04:40:10,200
They're they are they are cheaping they are cheaping those
fighting for it.

5953
04:40:10,200 --> 04:40:11,320
No risk.

5954
04:40:11,920 --> 04:40:14,080
Oh, they only have one support.

5955
04:40:14,500 --> 04:40:14,800
Wait what?

5956
04:40:15,420 --> 04:40:16,260
Oh, he kills me.

5957
04:40:16,480 --> 04:40:17,240
I can't find him.

5958
04:40:17,380 --> 04:40:17,900
He doesn't spawn.

5959
04:40:19,560 --> 04:40:20,360
They have a rocket.

5960
04:40:20,480 --> 04:40:24,640
They got the combo.

5961
04:40:24,940 --> 04:40:25,220
They got the combo.

5962
04:40:26,500 --> 04:40:30,860
Come on.

5963
04:40:31,120 --> 04:40:32,660
I'm trying.

5964
04:40:32,800 --> 04:40:33,220
I'm trying now, try.

5965
04:40:33,440 --> 04:40:34,020
Rocky one.

5966
04:40:34,180 --> 04:40:34,320
Rocky one.

5967
04:40:34,460 --> 04:40:34,600
Rof one.

5968
04:40:35,440 --> 04:40:35,760
I'm feeling her.

5969
04:40:35,760 --> 04:40:38,480
Okay, I don't think I can heal.

5970
04:40:39,300 --> 04:40:39,460
Yeah.

5971
04:40:43,300 --> 04:40:43,700
Fuck,

5972
04:40:46,820 --> 04:40:47,400
this is not good.

5973
04:40:47,600 --> 04:40:49,420
We get Gambit, but they get Gambit too.

5974
04:40:49,540 --> 04:40:50,120
They just copy.

5975
04:40:50,860 --> 04:40:52,060
Yeah, they get Gambit too.

5976
04:40:53,980 --> 04:40:56,080
I mean, the neutral should be good for us though.

5977
04:40:56,240 --> 04:40:59,740
Time to switch things up, including which side you're on.

5978
04:41:01,660 --> 04:41:02,980
Do you want to spawn on them?

5979
04:41:03,080 --> 04:41:05,080
I think it was spawn for they got no big enough.

5980
04:41:05,760 --> 04:41:06,340
I think so.

5981
04:41:06,860 --> 04:41:09,460
I think we go spawner with Gambit now and go Groot.

5982
04:41:10,140 --> 04:41:11,540
Groot Mac, I guess.

5983
04:41:13,040 --> 04:41:13,680
Someone go Mac.

5984
04:41:14,000 --> 04:41:14,160
Yeah.

5985
04:41:15,820 --> 04:41:17,460
With Gambit and Rocket.

5986
04:41:18,300 --> 04:41:18,440
No.

5987
04:41:19,200 --> 04:41:20,140
Go Cloak, I guess.

5988
04:41:20,760 --> 04:41:21,020
This one.

5989
04:41:21,400 --> 04:41:21,880
Okay.

5990
04:41:22,600 --> 04:41:23,420
I can go Cloak?

5991
04:41:24,180 --> 04:41:24,640
Yeah.

5992
04:41:25,160 --> 04:41:27,500
I think the Dome is very important to not die to Spider-Man.

5993
04:41:28,080 --> 04:41:29,020
Then where do I go?

5994
04:41:30,120 --> 04:41:30,880
Mantis now.

5995
04:41:31,680 --> 04:41:32,820
And then has Spiridly Go 10.

5996
04:41:32,840 --> 04:41:33,380
Isn't Rogue?

5997
04:41:33,820 --> 04:41:35,340
Isn't Rogue with Gambit.

5998
04:41:36,400 --> 04:41:39,340
Yeah, but I give 20% damage reduction, so I would rather
play that.

5999
04:41:39,500 --> 04:41:42,140
It's not really that OP because all of them just avoid my
hits.

6000
04:41:43,380 --> 04:41:44,820
Like I need to shoot them at least.

6001
04:41:44,980 --> 04:41:47,320
I don't have a weapon to shoot them one cloak, one rope.

6002
04:41:47,720 --> 04:41:49,640
I tried in the first two minutes, it was wasted time.

6003
04:41:50,040 --> 04:41:52,000
Yeah, yeah.

6004
04:41:52,160 --> 04:41:52,600
Let's wait.

6005
04:41:53,540 --> 04:41:56,840
Yeah, I was able to say, do you want to play until left?

6006
04:41:57,300 --> 04:41:58,500
Yeah, yeah, I think I'll do that.

6007
04:41:58,680 --> 04:41:59,060
How fast?

6008
04:41:59,080 --> 04:41:59,720
Where do we play?

6009
04:42:02,120 --> 04:42:03,940
They're going to be on dive again, but like slightly in
here.

6010
04:42:03,940 --> 04:42:05,160
So you guys play in the room, probably.

6011
04:42:05,240 --> 04:42:05,560
Okay.

6012
04:42:06,560 --> 04:42:07,180
Which room?

6013
04:42:07,180 --> 04:42:07,360
Which room?

6014
04:42:07,480 --> 04:42:07,960
Like back there?

6015
04:42:08,080 --> 04:42:08,860
Oh, you want to play this room?

6016
04:42:09,680 --> 04:42:10,660
Yeah, I think I'm making play left.

6017
04:42:10,960 --> 04:42:11,900
I think we play left.

6018
04:42:12,020 --> 04:42:13,300
So you guys play in this room.

6019
04:42:13,480 --> 04:42:13,600
This room.

6020
04:42:13,960 --> 04:42:14,440
On the left.

6021
04:42:14,660 --> 04:42:14,800
This room.

6022
04:42:15,280 --> 04:42:15,420
This room.

6023
04:42:15,500 --> 04:42:16,780
If they dive you guys, we can help you too.

6024
04:42:17,700 --> 04:42:18,660
Yeah, I'll give you my units.

6025
04:42:19,340 --> 04:42:20,740
Okay, just walk outside of the room.

6026
04:42:20,880 --> 04:42:21,520
Walk outside of the room.

6027
04:42:21,560 --> 04:42:22,960
We need to walk outside of here.

6028
04:42:24,040 --> 04:42:24,680
We need to walk outside of here.

6029
04:42:24,680 --> 04:42:25,420
I'm walking like this.

6030
04:42:26,460 --> 04:42:27,400
Wait, Muna 1, Muna 1, Muna 1.

6031
04:42:27,460 --> 04:42:28,160

Can you help me?

6035
04:42:32,300 --> 04:42:33,020

Spider-Man 1.

6065

Just die on point, die point, die point, die point if you're
gonna die.

6066
04:43:11,240 --> 04:43:12,680
Let's get into some good trouble.

6067
04:43:13,140 --> 04:43:13,860
I have my health, by the way.

6068
04:43:14,040 --> 04:43:14,620
Is he trying to cancel?

6069
04:43:14,700 --> 04:43:16,500
No, no, no, no, he might be now.

6070
04:43:16,600 --> 04:43:17,280
He might be now.

6071
04:43:17,560 --> 04:43:18,360
Okay, no, no, he's still with me.

6072
04:43:18,380 --> 04:43:18,820
He's still with me.

6073

He's still with me.

04:45:03,270 --> 04:45:04,170
I'm on Loki.

6106
04:45:04,350 --> 04:45:04,490
I'm on Loki.

6107
04:45:05,190 --> 04:45:05,550
I'm on Loki.

6108
04:45:05,850 --> 04:45:06,930
Look at him!

6109
04:45:07,230 --> 04:45:10,230
Oh, there's a wall, there's a wall, yeah.

6110
04:45:10,350 --> 04:45:10,930
I'm distracted, okay.

6111
04:45:12,410 --> 04:45:13,450
I'm dead, I'm dead.

6112
04:45:14,030 --> 04:45:14,810
Spider-Man 1!

6113
04:45:15,030 --> 04:45:15,590
Spider-Man 1!

6114
04:45:15,810 --> 04:45:16,810
I have no sleep for Spider-Man.

6115
04:45:17,450 --> 04:45:17,810
I'm 1.

6116
04:45:18,350 --> 04:45:18,910
Ah, next fight.

6117
04:45:19,450 --> 04:45:19,910
It's okay.

6118
04:45:21,030 --> 04:45:22,490
Always play to live in these situations.

6119
04:45:22,590 --> 04:45:24,050
Guys, Cloakult, we're not killing Fru.

6120
04:45:24,190 --> 04:45:25,070
Always live, okay?

6121
04:45:25,670 --> 04:45:26,230
Always live.

6122
04:45:26,510 --> 04:45:27,350
Never fight it.

6123
04:45:27,750 --> 04:45:28,670
Always play to live.

6124
04:45:30,510 --> 04:45:31,330
Need next fight.

6125
04:45:32,670 --> 04:45:33,910
We have Cloakult.

6126
04:45:34,270 --> 04:45:35,830
We have, uh, Gambit.

6127
04:45:37,070 --> 04:45:39,530
I feel like myself again.

6128
04:45:39,690 --> 04:45:40,730
We'll just go, okay?

6129
04:45:41,470 --> 04:45:42,690
Yeah, we can just kill.

6130
04:45:42,890 --> 04:45:43,670
Kill the Groot, ready?

6131
04:45:44,530 --> 04:45:52,830
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

6134
04:45:55,050 --> 04:45:57,950
Can we lift?

6135
04:45:59,030 --> 04:45:59,350
I haven't touched.

6136
04:45:59,830 --> 04:46:02,730
Yeah, I'm trying to help our gambit.

6137
04:46:03,830 --> 04:46:04,390
I'm just gonna go in.

6138
04:46:04,390 --> 04:46:05,370
I'll go in, go to me, go to me, go to me.

6139
04:46:05,710 --> 04:46:06,690
I can use speed.

6140
04:46:07,210 --> 04:46:07,630
Wait, grid troll.

6141
04:46:07,650 --> 04:46:08,650
Grid troll, like grid trolling.

6142
04:46:08,970 --> 04:46:09,710
I'm trying to help you, monster.

6143
04:46:11,050 --> 04:46:12,490
There's a Moon Knight on me.

6144
04:46:13,670 --> 04:46:14,430
There's a waltz for waltz.

6145
04:46:16,850 --> 04:46:18,150
Oh, I don't know.

6146
04:46:18,150 --> 04:46:18,350
I don't know.

6147
04:46:18,550 --> 04:46:20,410
I'm fine, I'm fine.

6148
04:46:20,770 --> 04:46:21,170
I'm fine.

6149
04:46:21,330 --> 04:46:21,430
I couldn't.

6150
04:46:21,690 --> 04:46:22,490
I got ulted.

6151
04:46:23,890 --> 04:46:24,830
Oh, I think it's...

6152
04:46:26,290 --> 04:46:26,850
We have...

6153
04:46:26,850 --> 04:46:27,690
Just die, Karik.

6154
04:46:27,910 --> 04:46:28,090
We're gonna die.

6155
04:46:28,170 --> 04:46:29,470
We have full health as well.

6156
04:46:29,550 --> 04:46:33,630

6206
04:48:16,590 --> 04:48:21,230
I just had Spider-Man and cloak chasing after me wherever I
go.

6207
04:48:21,490 --> 04:48:22,250
I'm trying to show him.

6208
04:48:22,430 --> 04:48:22,810
That's why?

6209
04:48:22,830 --> 04:48:30,170
play this hero i don't it's just like 30 seconds of support
ults i can't kill anything yeah no we have to just pray that

6210
04:48:30,170 --> 04:48:39,330
we live i'm gonna go toilet i'll be right what can i do
because like the spy match is actually a heavy chasing after

6211
04:48:39,330 --> 04:48:48,590
me with someone else yeah and i just get like i just get
blown up even with other supports healing me

6212
04:48:53,090 --> 04:48:58,850
i don't know what to do I'm like, I exist and then I blow
up.

6213
04:49:00,070 --> 04:49:02,670
I'm like, we have to trade the enemy back then.

6214
04:49:03,270 --> 04:49:05,010
That's like, what we can do.

6215
04:49:07,530 --> 04:49:08,750
See, I hate dive.

6216
04:49:09,230 --> 04:49:10,790
I fucking hate dive.

6217
04:49:11,810 --> 04:49:12,690
I don't know what to do.

6218
04:49:12,870 --> 04:49:16,730
I feel like I just exist just to blow up.

6219
04:49:17,750 --> 04:49:19,790
I think we have tried it, but look, you look.

6220
04:49:20,230 --> 04:49:22,450
No, they want me to save it for them.

6221
04:49:23,030 --> 04:49:25,230
So it's like, I can't really save it.

6222
04:49:25,250 --> 04:49:37,030
it for myself because like they want me to use it to like
use it to save them i feel like if i don't use it because

6223
04:49:37,030 --> 04:49:43,890
like i got yelled at for using myself in the past it's just
impossible to kill

6224
04:49:48,570 --> 04:49:52,730
i mean i can use it on myself but i'm worried that they
they'll explode

6225
04:49:56,940 --> 04:50:07,340
I'm not gonna ash again It's like in the J3 tournament When
during scrims I got yelled at For using bubbles On myself

6226
04:50:07,340 --> 04:50:16,440
Because they have to use it more Defensively on my team So
now I'm like second guessing On how to use it Any more ban,

6227
04:50:16,520 --> 04:50:17,120
huh?

6228
04:50:20,930 --> 04:50:24,550
It's deadly Like why shouldn't I have gone Bucky there?

6229
04:50:31,680 --> 04:50:38,180
should i just save my dome for myself because i feel like
yeah yeah you have to when you're playing yeah you have to

6230
04:50:38,180 --> 04:50:47,700
okay i think maybe you can play wolf here as well okay we
got our answer we play selfish especially we have like silo

6231
04:50:47,700 --> 04:50:58,040
all right we're gonna be selfish fuck my team i live be on
the tanks of the game yeah fuck my team okay

6232
04:51:06,990 --> 04:51:07,810
It is what it is.

6233
04:51:08,390 --> 04:51:09,930
It's just hard, hard dive me.

6234
04:51:10,110 --> 04:51:12,190
So I'll just be like, I die.

6235
04:51:20,110 --> 04:51:21,090
Okay, what is the plan?

6236
04:51:21,330 --> 04:51:23,290
I think the plan is we ban Loki too.

6237
04:51:24,070 --> 04:51:25,970
Yeah, I think we instead of cap, we just ban Loki.

6238
04:51:26,250 --> 04:51:27,170
Yeah, I think so.

6239
04:51:27,990 --> 04:51:33,590
Also, I think if they go ban on Groot, which is like with
the dive DPS, we just put Moxie on Wolf, no?

6240
04:51:34,370 --> 04:51:36,930
Yeah, you just go Phoenix Wolf and go Mac.

6241
04:51:36,990 --> 04:51:44,490
that'll be fine yeah i just don't know what to do when i'm
on rocket when that happens to me because i literally saved

6242
04:51:44,490 --> 04:51:47,550
my dashes and it feels like it didn't work on phoenix

6243
04:51:53,010 --> 04:52:01,630
map is it central park central park it's good dd map i don't
know like what to do like i don't know what to do with

6244
04:52:01,630 --> 04:52:12,210
rocket rocket like i dashed away but i still why not go
bucky trust me i mean I don't think we're killing the Bucky.

6245
04:52:13,390 --> 04:52:15,670
I don't think we're killing the crew with Bucky in Canada.

6246
04:52:15,850 --> 04:52:18,650
If I live on the walls, they know they can spy me instantly.

6247
04:52:19,070 --> 04:52:27,630
I think living on the walls is not a smart idea, only
because their DPS, their hit scan will just shoot me down.

6248
04:52:27,930 --> 04:52:29,710
And their hit scan is literally Delana.

6249
04:52:32,610 --> 04:52:37,610
Their hit scan is literally number one team in NA hit scan
play.

6250
04:52:38,570 --> 04:52:44,950
It's not like it rank where I can believe and them not
hitting their shots they put i was just low-key listening

6251
04:52:44,950 --> 04:52:53,850
dude i don't know i meant this i know i know and then just
grab just grab so it's not like they'll miss or anything

6252
04:52:54,710 --> 04:53:00,230
yeah like you can either play like super defensive and just
sit on your backline and be like the venom or you can just

6253
04:53:00,230 --> 04:53:06,630
probably walk on the grid because they have a spidey silo i
do stick too close to my team but it's like they spoke they

6254
04:53:06,630 --> 04:53:15,190
had they just burst fire me like did you guys see that part
in the front, we're at the front, and then like, I was

6255
04:53:15,190 --> 04:53:20,450
literally in my team and then the Spider-Man Venom walked
in, and then I died.

6256
04:53:20,790 --> 04:53:23,990
I exploded in front of my entire six-man team.

6257
04:53:24,570 --> 04:53:27,730
We can't win with the best, we can't lose with the best
character in the game.

6258
04:53:28,110 --> 04:53:28,590
After DD.

6259
04:53:29,790 --> 04:53:30,490
It's alright, it's alright.

6260
04:53:30,630 --> 04:53:31,470
We got this.

6261
04:53:31,650 --> 04:53:33,210
Yeah, I was just like, I'm, okay.

6262
04:53:36,050 --> 04:53:38,650
I was just like, I'm with my team.

6263
04:53:38,790 --> 04:53:40,190
I'm not with my team.

6264
04:53:40,390 --> 04:53:41,590
I die.

6265
04:53:43,970 --> 04:53:45,850
I mean, then we're just not at the top of the building.

6266
04:53:46,150 --> 04:53:48,870
Yeah, but then that makes let's the corner me faster.

6267
04:53:50,170 --> 04:53:55,990
I feel like that gives them an opportunity to corner me
easily with Spider-Man because I'm not with my team.

6268
04:53:57,010 --> 04:53:57,910
I think we give cap.

6269
04:53:59,290 --> 04:54:01,810
No, I'd rather have a pro player on Gambit than me.

6270
04:54:01,910 --> 04:54:03,130
I'd rather play against the cap than a fucking Angela too.

6271
04:54:03,490 --> 04:54:06,310
A pro player will have more impact on Gambit than I would.

6272
04:54:07,430 --> 04:54:16,530
Because the thing is, I'm the only well me and moxie me and
moxie that's fine like i don't think moxie ever played pro i

6273
04:54:16,530 --> 04:54:22,830
don't necros has played pro in overwatch but like all of
like me and moxie are the only ones that have have never

6274
04:54:22,830 --> 04:54:31,850
played pro before so this is like hard this is harder
because these guys actually know what the fuck they're doing

6275
04:54:31,850 --> 04:54:42,770
it's definitely a lot harder i think i think you've been sue
i think you've been sue i think it's like hey dive fuck dive

6276
04:54:42,770 --> 04:54:52,190
if this was this is the yeah it's inside bill fuck dive room
droplet yeah if they go like the same romp as last time

6277
04:54:52,190 --> 04:55:00,970
loving dive because it is the best comp bro i mean we have
no brains let me unga Bunga!

6278
04:55:01,390 --> 04:55:02,370
With Jeff.

6279
04:55:02,850 --> 04:55:03,810
So how do we stop the Jeff?

6280
04:55:05,370 --> 04:55:05,770
Starlord?

6281
04:55:05,930 --> 04:55:06,570
Oh, the Starlord.

6282
04:55:07,490 --> 04:55:08,790
They can't like Lambert.

6283
04:55:09,250 --> 04:55:13,150
God damn EU players so smart that they can do dive.

6284
04:55:15,350 --> 04:55:18,290
That's how they eliminated all the NA players that land.

6285
04:55:19,450 --> 04:55:22,270
You don't fucking know what we're doing.

6286
04:55:22,510 --> 04:55:22,910
That's fine.

6287
04:55:23,130 --> 04:55:24,370
You'll need a top notch team.

6288
04:55:24,370 --> 04:55:25,290
It's kind of annoying.

6289
04:55:25,310 --> 04:55:25,810
Oh, Starlord.

6290
04:55:25,970 --> 04:55:26,830
Why do I try to go pro?

6291
04:55:26,890 --> 04:55:27,970
Because I don't want to be depressed.

6292
04:55:29,050 --> 04:55:29,850
I don't want to be depressed.

6293
04:55:30,050 --> 04:55:30,290
I don't want to be depressed.

6294
04:55:30,830 --> 04:55:35,690
Yeah, I think Starlord, Starlord Phoenix looks like it to
me.

6295
04:55:36,070 --> 04:55:37,890
They don't really have that good support against it.

6296
04:55:37,990 --> 04:55:39,130
And I'll just go dive character.

6297
04:55:39,850 --> 04:55:42,230
I think I'll go cap and we get a rocket.

6298
04:55:42,610 --> 04:55:43,930
I mean, like what supports can they even play?

6299
04:55:44,090 --> 04:55:47,310
They have to play like Rocket Dash, then they're just going
to show him by like their own.

6300
04:55:48,310 --> 04:55:49,410
Every ult possible.

6301
04:55:49,650 --> 04:55:50,950
Yeah, I think so.

6302
04:55:51,690 --> 04:55:54,790
I think if you go, we just cap and sit on the jab, like it's
unplayable for him.

6303
04:55:54,910 --> 04:55:55,830
So nothing will change.

6304
04:55:55,910 --> 04:55:57,450
Yeah, but then I'd be more depressed.

6305
04:55:59,270 --> 04:56:00,290
I'm just going to get a good ult here.

6306
04:56:00,990 --> 04:56:02,090
There's a limit.

6307
04:56:02,910 --> 04:56:05,670
If they have Groot, I would rather play that.

6308
04:56:08,070 --> 04:56:08,950
I think...

6309
04:56:08,950 --> 04:56:10,250
They don't have that good support.

6310
04:56:10,530 --> 04:56:12,930
I'd rather minimize my depression, guys.

6311
04:56:14,450 --> 04:56:16,450
Guys, I'd rather minimize it.

6312
04:56:16,670 --> 04:56:18,070
We also have Angie.

6313
04:56:18,370 --> 04:56:20,310
We also have Angie open versus like...

6314
04:56:21,170 --> 04:56:22,110
No, no, no.

6315
04:56:22,850 --> 04:56:23,590
I have plans.

6316
04:56:25,190 --> 04:56:27,070
Just swap it mid-round if you think it's good.

6317
04:56:27,690 --> 04:56:28,890
I can go with two.

6318
04:56:30,310 --> 04:56:31,890
I can go Venom, is it?

6319
04:56:32,290 --> 04:56:33,530
I'm going to go behind them.

6320
04:56:33,530 --> 04:56:35,830
I think Angelo is better against full dive.

6321
04:56:35,970 --> 04:56:38,550
If they have Rocket or Jeff, Angelo is more consistent.

6322
04:56:38,610 --> 04:56:40,590
All you need to do is capture the mission area.

6323
04:56:40,830 --> 04:56:41,470
Save Sigh.

6324
04:56:41,810 --> 04:56:42,470
Wait, Cap left.

6325
04:56:42,470 --> 04:56:42,910
Cap left.

6326
04:56:43,650 --> 04:56:45,930
Yeah, Venom Cap, Venom Cap.

6327
04:56:45,930 --> 04:56:47,630
Venom Cap Rocket or something.

6328
04:56:48,370 --> 04:56:49,470
They're farming Sportal.

6329
04:56:49,510 --> 04:56:50,950
They're farming Sportal.

6330
04:56:51,270 --> 04:56:51,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

6331
04:56:53,730 --> 04:56:54,330
I think.

6332
04:56:54,650 --> 04:56:56,130
Venom, Venom, Venom, Venom.

6333
04:56:58,710 --> 04:56:59,230
I'm dead.

6334
04:57:00,670 --> 04:57:01,250
He's on the back.

6335
04:57:01,810 --> 04:57:04,170
Nice, nice, nice, chill, chill, chill, chill.

6336
04:57:04,410 --> 04:57:04,910
He arrest.

6337
04:57:07,650 --> 04:57:08,050
What's the idea?

6338
04:57:08,230 --> 04:57:09,950
Play slow, play slow, play slow, we're down support.

6339
04:57:09,990 --> 04:57:11,170
Side one, side one, side one.

6340
04:57:11,530 --> 04:57:12,390
We can't do anything yet.

6341
04:57:12,530 --> 04:57:13,510
Just wait, just wait.

6342
04:57:13,750 --> 04:57:14,230
Oh, Moxie is dead.

6343
04:57:14,670 --> 04:57:14,950

They use most of the portals.

6353
04:58:18,110 --> 04:58:19,350
Yeah, they only have a Psyus.

6354
04:58:19,890 --> 04:58:21,350
Yeah, they still have Phoenix all.

6355
04:58:22,490 --> 04:58:23,210
They don't do that now.

6356
04:58:24,050 --> 04:58:25,030
You're right, DJ right, DJ right.

6357
04:58:25,550 --> 04:58:28,190
I think I'm going to use Phoenix early since they just
rocketed me.

6358
04:58:28,230 --> 04:58:29,070
Rock one, rock one, rock one.

Luna main.

6360
04:58:31,290 --> 04:58:32,990
Luna is super valuable, but it's same as rock one.

04:58:33,110 --> 04:58:35,210

Cancel, cancel, cancel, cancel.

6425
05:00:26,210 --> 05:00:27,350
We need cap.

We need cap.

6427
05:00:31,890 --> 05:00:33,550
We need to shoot the Venom on point.

6428
05:00:33,610 --> 05:00:34,450
It's Venom and cap.

6429
05:00:35,170 --> 05:00:36,850
Yeah, we can't do anything about it.

6430
05:00:36,990 --> 05:00:39,230
They have no gills though, you guys should really kill them.

6431
05:00:39,230 --> 05:00:39,690
Yeah.

6432
05:00:43,430 --> 05:00:44,050

6433
05:00:44,110 --> 05:00:44,530
They're number one!

6434
05:00:44,630 --> 05:00:45,490
Go Phoenix, go Phoenix.

05:00:48,950 --> 05:00:49,870
Yeah, yeah, I need it.

6438
05:00:49,910 --> 05:00:50,050
Me!

6439
05:00:50,570 --> 05:00:51,790
Wait, look, look, look, Phoenix.

6440
05:00:51,970 --> 05:00:52,350
Look, Phoenix.

6441
05:00:52,510 --> 05:00:54,210
Look, look, look.

6442
05:00:55,990 --> 05:00:56,430
Look up.

6443
05:00:56,430 --> 05:00:56,630
Come on, this Venom.

6444
05:00:57,870 --> 05:01:00,310
Shoot the Venom, Venom, Venom, Venom!

6445
05:01:00,430 --> 05:01:00,650
Venom!

6446
05:01:00,650 --> 05:01:00,710
Venom!

6447
05:01:00,710 --> 05:01:08,350
Cap, Cap, Cap, Cap, Cap, Cap, Cap, Cap, Cap, Cap, Cap, Cap,
Cap, Cap, Cap, Cap, I push back.

6448
05:01:08,570 --> 05:01:08,990
I push back.

6449
05:01:08,990 --> 05:01:09,930
Venom, I have Venom!

6450
05:01:10,190 --> 05:01:10,770
Venom on cart!

6451
05:01:10,850 --> 05:01:11,470
Venom on cart!

6452
05:01:11,610 --> 05:01:12,010
Venom on cart!

6453
05:01:13,030 --> 05:01:13,950
Yeah, any heal, any heal?

6454
05:01:14,070 --> 05:01:14,330
Oh.

6455
05:01:14,450 --> 05:01:14,770
I get a rest.

6456
05:01:15,130 --> 05:01:15,310
I get a rest.

6457
05:01:15,410 --> 05:01:15,530
Okay.

6458
05:01:15,890 --> 05:01:16,850
That's good.

6459
05:01:16,890 --> 05:01:17,610
Can you break?

6460
05:01:17,710 --> 05:01:18,690
Oh, he almost broke.

6461
05:01:19,030 --> 05:01:19,190
Yeah.

6462
05:01:21,250 --> 05:01:22,470
I couldn't get out of that.

6463
05:01:22,490 --> 05:01:28,470
You and Ven, Ven, Ven, Ven, Ven, Ven, Ven, Ven, Ven, Ven,
Ven, Ven, Ven, Ven, Ven, Ven, Ven, Ven, Ven, Ven, one, one,

6464
05:01:28,470 --> 05:01:28,670
one, one, DD.

6465
05:01:29,750 --> 05:01:30,270
DD, DD, no need to fight.

6466
05:01:30,410 --> 05:01:31,430
Phoenix won.

6467
05:01:31,550 --> 05:01:33,050
Phoenix won.

6468
05:01:33,530 --> 05:01:34,270
I push Phoenix.

6469
05:01:34,430 --> 05:01:35,250
I need to live.

6470
05:01:35,410 --> 05:01:35,710
I need to live.

6471
05:01:35,830 --> 05:01:35,890
I need to live.

6472
05:01:35,890 --> 05:01:36,130
Just chill.

6473
05:01:36,230 --> 05:01:36,410
Just chill.

6474
05:01:36,590 --> 05:01:36,690
Just chill.

6475
05:01:38,110 --> 05:01:38,810
I'm killing him.

6476
05:01:38,890 --> 05:01:39,350
I'm killing him.

6477
05:01:40,010 --> 05:01:40,350
He's on.

6478
05:01:42,950 --> 05:01:43,950
Okay, we got Riz, we got Riz.

6479
05:01:44,350 --> 05:01:45,170
One and multiple, one Okay.

6480
05:01:45,170 --> 05:01:46,130
Walk my out, walk my out!

6481
05:01:46,190 --> 05:01:47,430
I am ready to go.

6482
05:01:48,210 --> 05:01:49,030
I can ... I can two.

6483
05:01:49,270 --> 05:01:50,310
I can heal them after this.

6484
05:01:50,410 --> 05:01:51,610
I can kill them.

6485
05:01:52,250 --> 05:01:53,590
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

6486
05:01:53,650 --> 05:01:54,310
Wait, rocket!

6487
05:01:54,730 --> 05:01:54,750
Rocket, Rocket!

6488
05:01:55,430 --> 05:01:56,350
Trey, Trey, Trey!

6489
05:01:56,810 --> 05:01:59,310
Two, one, Fenix one, Treenix one, Fdire.

6490
05:01:59,410 --> 05:02:00,290
I'm shooting card.

6491
05:02:00,430 --> 05:02:00,770
Drow's in.

6492
05:02:02,210 --> 05:02:03,090
He'll try to get to you.

6493
05:02:04,010 --> 05:02:05,190
I need him, you're on pasley.

6494
05:02:05,570 --> 05:02:05,890
Hercook him.

6495
05:02:05,890 --> 05:02:07,570
He got you.

6496
05:02:07,810 --> 05:02:08,250
Fennek, wait, go.

6497
05:02:08,910 --> 05:02:09,230
Okay.

6498
05:02:09,350 --> 05:02:09,470
Walk.

6499
05:02:09,590 --> 05:02:09,690
Okay, walk.

6500
05:02:09,990 --> 05:02:10,310
Thanks.

6501
05:02:10,410 --> 05:02:11,750
Go back, come back, back, finally.

6502
05:02:13,710 --> 05:02:14,430
Very slow.

6503
05:02:14,430 --> 05:02:15,030
I can't, okay, okay.

6504
05:02:15,190 --> 05:02:16,770
Venom, Venom on cart.

6505
05:02:16,970 --> 05:02:17,730
Venom one, Venom one.

6506
05:02:18,110 --> 05:02:18,450
Venom one, Venom one.

6507
05:02:18,450 --> 05:02:19,310
Rocket one, Rocket one.

6508
05:02:19,530 --> 05:02:21,350
Captain, Captain Mirka on cart.

6509
05:02:22,450 --> 05:02:24,070
Chill him point, chill him point.

6510
05:02:24,070 --> 05:02:25,010
I can't cancel TP.

6511
05:02:25,150 --> 05:02:26,110
I'm in a really bad spot.

6512
05:02:26,410 --> 05:02:27,290
I can't really cancel TP.

6513
05:02:27,650 --> 05:02:28,290
Just chill, just chill.

6514
05:02:28,570 --> 05:02:29,170
And he can, he can.

6515
05:02:29,290 --> 05:02:30,050
No TP, no TP.

6516
05:02:30,430 --> 05:02:31,310
He can, he can, he can, please.

6517
05:02:31,790 --> 05:02:32,910
I'm gonna grab this.

6518
05:02:33,130 --> 05:02:33,270
Okay.

6519
05:02:34,690 --> 05:02:37,250
Shoot the cart, shoot the cart, shoot the cart, shoot the
cart, shoot the cart.

6520
05:02:37,330 --> 05:02:38,650
Venom, Venom, Venom, Venom, Venom.

6521
05:02:39,670 --> 05:02:39,870
Bro.

6522
05:02:41,490 --> 05:02:42,010
No support.

6523
05:02:42,350 --> 05:02:42,710
No support.

6524
05:02:42,950 --> 05:02:43,550
No supports.

6525
05:02:43,910 --> 05:02:44,410
You do me.

6526
05:02:44,550 --> 05:02:44,710
You do me.

6527
05:02:44,850 --> 05:02:45,150
You do me.

6528
05:02:45,290 --> 05:02:45,510
You do me.

6529
05:02:45,510 --> 05:02:45,730
You do me.

6530
05:02:48,950 --> 05:02:50,170
You do one.

6531
05:02:50,430 --> 05:02:50,690
You do one.

6532
05:02:54,250 --> 05:02:54,970
You do one.

6533
05:02:54,970 --> 05:02:56,170
I'm 75 on all.

6534
05:02:56,550 --> 05:02:57,610
I'm trying to get close to.

6535
05:02:58,590 --> 05:03:01,210
I'm trying to 80, 80.

6536
05:03:01,350 --> 05:03:01,870
I'm only 80.

6537
05:03:02,110 --> 05:03:02,230
I'm trying to 80.

6538
05:03:02,230 --> 05:03:02,550
I guess I'm fine.

6539
05:03:02,730 --> 05:03:03,370
I can't stay fine.

6540
05:03:03,470 --> 05:03:03,890
I can stay fine.

6541
05:03:05,210 --> 05:03:05,830
I can stay fine.

6542
05:03:05,950 --> 05:03:07,050
Uh, I can, you know, touch, touch, touch.

6543
05:03:07,170 --> 05:03:07,550
I can all tap right.

6544
05:03:07,630 --> 05:03:07,990
I'll tap right.

6545
05:03:08,150 --> 05:03:08,770
I need that one.

6546
05:03:09,070 --> 05:03:09,930
I need that one.

6547
05:03:09,930 --> 05:03:11,310
I need heal me, heal me, heal me, heal me.

6548
05:03:11,450 --> 05:03:11,530
He'll be.

6549
05:03:11,530 --> 05:03:11,710
Fuck me.

6550
05:03:13,070 --> 05:03:13,350
Really?

6551
05:03:16,130 --> 05:03:16,410
Uh...

6552
05:03:16,410 --> 05:03:17,530
Point, point, point, point.

6553
05:03:17,850 --> 05:03:18,570
I got it, guys.

6554
05:03:18,610 --> 05:03:19,710
I got it.

6555
05:03:19,790 --> 05:03:19,850
I got it.

6556
05:03:20,710 --> 05:03:21,630
No heals, no more.

6557
05:03:24,250 --> 05:03:25,030
They have no heals.

6558
05:03:25,190 --> 05:03:25,430
They have no heals.

6559
05:03:25,670 --> 05:03:25,950
They have no heals.

6560
05:03:25,950 --> 05:03:25,970
They have no heals.

6561
05:03:25,970 --> 05:03:26,230
I am so low.

6562
05:03:26,350 --> 05:03:26,690
They have no heals.

6563
05:03:27,190 --> 05:03:27,370
They have no heals.

6564
05:03:27,370 --> 05:03:27,650
Play the bubble.

6565
05:03:27,770 --> 05:03:28,130
Play the bubble.

6566
05:03:28,670 --> 05:03:29,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6567
05:03:29,290 --> 05:03:30,050
Tap, tap, tap, tap.

6568
05:03:31,150 --> 05:03:31,270
Tap.

6569
05:03:31,370 --> 05:03:31,650
Tap.

6570
05:03:32,370 --> 05:03:32,650
Tap.

6571
05:03:32,750 --> 05:03:35,850
You have TP here.

6572
05:03:36,570 --> 05:03:37,230
Come on, I'm on, man.

6573
05:03:38,010 --> 05:03:38,390
Stay on, stand.

6574
05:03:38,530 --> 05:03:38,830
Need a stand.

6575
05:03:38,910 --> 05:03:39,470
Need a stand.

6576
05:03:39,810 --> 05:03:40,570
I'm off, I'm off, I'm off.

6577
05:03:42,950 --> 05:03:44,550
I really needed that.

6578
05:03:44,730 --> 05:03:46,410
I'm going to be close to Gambit, if you want to come back.

6579
05:03:47,950 --> 05:03:49,250
I'm on Rocket, bottom right?

6580
05:03:49,290 --> 05:03:52,030
Oh my god, I got...

6581
05:03:52,030 --> 05:03:52,710
Oh my god, the Phoenix.

6582
05:03:55,350 --> 05:03:56,210
Rocket's one bottom right.

6583
05:03:56,470 --> 05:03:57,150
Nice, tank.

6584
05:03:58,790 --> 05:03:59,890
You have Gambit on.

6585
05:03:59,910 --> 05:04:00,870
Luna on point.

6586
05:04:01,270 --> 05:04:01,730
One, one, one, one.

6587
05:04:02,390 --> 05:04:05,250
Yeah, Phoenix, Phoenix, Phoenix, Phoenix.

6588
05:04:07,330 --> 05:04:09,050
Look, bottom right, look bottom right, backline.

6589
05:04:12,950 --> 05:04:14,950
He'll point, I'll heal point, heal point, heal point.

6590
05:04:16,430 --> 05:04:17,410
There it is.

6591
05:04:20,890 --> 05:04:24,760
That counts.

6592
05:04:25,280 --> 05:04:26,240
I don't know.

6593
05:04:28,540 --> 05:04:30,440
I mean, they're just holding points forever.

6594
05:04:32,940 --> 05:04:34,860
I mean, we do the same, I think.

6595
05:04:35,700 --> 05:04:35,860
No?

6596
05:04:37,460 --> 05:04:38,100
I think...

6597
05:04:38,100 --> 05:04:39,700
Go triple again, no?

6598
05:04:41,560 --> 05:04:42,200
I think...

6599
05:04:42,200 --> 05:04:44,160
I think triple with mech, go triple with mech then.

6600
05:04:44,160 --> 05:04:46,660
They just rotate stars with Captain and Venom.

6601
05:04:51,880 --> 05:04:52,740
I think I'll go Emma.

6602
05:04:53,700 --> 05:04:54,900
Yeah, I'll go Emma.

6603
05:04:55,320 --> 05:04:55,780
It's fine.

6604
05:04:56,280 --> 05:04:57,800
But if they have Cloak, you should go back.

6605
05:04:57,980 --> 05:04:59,260
I died less, guys.

6606
05:04:59,620 --> 05:05:00,000
I did it.

6607
05:05:00,280 --> 05:05:01,620
I didn't go behind the wall.

6608
05:05:01,760 --> 05:05:03,000
I don't think you can hit.

6609
05:05:03,140 --> 05:05:04,320
I mean, I can hit anything.

6610
05:05:05,560 --> 05:05:09,320
Yeah, but you at least were forced to go off of all the
supports.

6611
05:05:10,680 --> 05:05:11,680
I don't know what to say.

6612
05:05:11,800 --> 05:05:12,860
Like, the matchup should be fine.

6613
05:05:13,040 --> 05:05:14,200
I think Angela is also fine.

6614
05:05:14,680 --> 05:05:15,780
I really think Angela was good.

6615
05:05:17,160 --> 05:05:25,460
see namo is open no play namo no it's bad oh gg then go
phoenix go phoenix that's fine phoenix well i feel i'm

6616
05:05:25,460 --> 05:05:34,360
damaging i don't know i mean they just need to die more they
might just pump clock out and go with it i got you sorry but

6617
05:05:34,360 --> 05:05:42,580
your one-eyed warrior isn't even playable yet i mean full

6714
05:09:27,030 --> 05:09:27,630
Don't even fly.

I wanna go early.

6727
05:09:50,630 --> 05:09:53,030
I think we have to go for a first try to kill through.

6728
05:09:53,850 --> 05:09:56,590
with Gordon Gambit's eye.

6729
05:09:56,610 --> 05:09:57,910

I can see you.

6734
05:10:06,030 --> 05:10:07,490
I can use my ult as well.

6735
05:10:07,850 --> 05:10:08,590
Improves him.

6736
05:10:09,390 --> 05:10:10,930

I can ult after.

6741
05:10:18,570 --> 05:10:19,590
He can heal me in the back maybe.

6742
05:10:20,570 --> 05:10:20,890
I can.

6743
05:10:21,410 --> 05:10:21,730
I'll touch.

6744
05:10:21,810 --> 05:10:22,330

6745
05:10:22,490 --> 05:10:22,730
I'll touch.

6746
05:10:24,170 --> 05:10:25,370
What do you want to see?

6747
05:10:25,570 --> 05:10:27,010
They're the one, they're the one, no they're the one.

6748
05:10:27,870 --> 05:10:28,230
He's the one.

6749
05:10:31,310 --> 05:10:32,370
Just chill, just chill.

6750
05:10:32,490 --> 05:10:33,390
Can you live, can you live finally?

6751
05:10:33,630 --> 05:10:33,970
I can.

6752
05:10:34,530 --> 05:10:35,290
Where is he being?

6753
05:10:35,430 --> 05:10:35,690
We are fatigue.

6754
05:10:36,010 --> 05:10:36,670
I have I have losses.

6755
05:10:36,710 --> 05:10:36,930
Okay.

6756
05:10:37,250 --> 05:10:38,310
They have no support ults.

6757
05:10:38,490 --> 05:10:39,030
They's both.

6758
05:10:39,130 --> 05:10:40,950
You can cancel.

6759
05:10:41,230 --> 05:10:41,990
Ooh yeah, baby.

6760
05:10:42,230 --> 05:10:45,650
He's on the way.

6761
05:10:45,690 --> 05:10:46,230
Phoenix long.

6762
05:10:46,790 --> 05:10:47,090
Just wait.

6763
05:10:47,170 --> 05:10:47,610
Dave, cap kill.

6764
05:10:47,810 --> 05:10:48,210
Dave cap kill.

6765
05:10:48,850 --> 05:10:49,790
Can I have enemol?

6766
05:10:50,050 --> 05:10:51,730
I think someone's flanking.

6767
05:10:51,790 --> 05:10:52,550
I think someone's flanking fine.

6768
05:10:53,850 --> 05:10:54,510
I hit backline.

6769
05:10:54,530 --> 05:10:54,990
Yeah, Daredevil.

6770
05:10:55,310 --> 05:10:56,430

05:11:01,590 --> 05:11:01,790
I'm dead.

6777
05:11:01,990 --> 05:11:02,970

6778
05:11:03,150 --> 05:11:03,750
No, no, no, no.

6779
05:11:03,850 --> 05:11:04,670
The Daredevil got the res.

6780
05:11:04,750 --> 05:11:04,950
The Daredevil.

6781
05:11:05,210 --> 05:11:05,490
We're backline.

6782
05:11:05,590 --> 05:11:06,050
Our backline.

6783
05:11:06,110 --> 05:11:06,530
Please help.

6784
05:11:06,710 --> 05:11:07,050

6786
05:11:19,600 --> 05:11:20,340
I don't know.

6787
05:11:22,340 --> 05:11:23,060
Final score.

6788
05:11:23,280 --> 05:11:24,440
Should have been kept, I guess.

6789
05:11:25,740 --> 05:11:32,420
i mean it's just full dive it's the best comp in the game so
it's like so hard to live i guess maybe needed to go with

6790
05:11:32,420 --> 05:11:45,160
the strip again and try to win instead yeah like yeah we
were healing each other but no that was last and then it's

6791
05:11:45,160 --> 05:11:54,720
and then it's tomorrow bracket because like the gam and i
were healing each other but it wasn't enough we can't out

6792
05:11:54,720 --> 05:11:57,540
heal the I don't know what I'm supposed to do first point,
by the way.

6793
05:11:57,700 --> 05:12:00,000
Like, if I shoot my gun, they're going to get Cloakle.

6794
05:12:00,160 --> 05:12:01,800
And if I don't shoot my gun, they take the whole map.

6795
05:12:02,040 --> 05:12:02,420
So, I don't know.

6796
05:12:02,780 --> 05:12:03,880
It was over, dude.

6797
05:12:04,880 --> 05:12:05,620
Oh, my God.

6798
05:12:05,740 --> 05:12:06,580
I don't know what to do either.

6799
05:12:07,080 --> 05:12:08,180
I swear I did so much.

6800
05:12:08,340 --> 05:12:10,080
I don't know how to do more.

6801
05:12:10,900 --> 05:12:12,240
Like, I need to play Angelo there.

6802
05:12:12,500 --> 05:12:15,420
What do we do when me and the Gambit were getting jumped
there?

6803
05:12:15,540 --> 05:12:17,360
Because, like, we were both healing each other.

6804
05:12:17,860 --> 05:12:21,500
But, like, we can't out-heal the full damage in the end.

6805
05:12:28,510 --> 05:12:29,550
Oh, no one's sitting.

6806
05:12:29,570 --> 05:12:41,850
say anything okay i guess i'll never learn i can't the data
is doing infinite i can't play the game he goes into my

6807
05:12:41,850 --> 05:12:50,750
background we can never clear him we can't it's all right as
a as the tokens i'm not gonna lie like i guess thanks guys

6808
05:12:50,750 --> 05:12:56,470
see like the damage i don't know no that's why full time is
okay you know we can't stop it there's nothing that changes

6809
05:12:56,470 --> 05:13:09,450
the ep maybe goes doesn't stop it yeah just now die and i'm
like bro me and the other support we just heal each other i

6810
05:13:09,450 --> 05:13:15,690
don't think thing changes anything there they're still gonna
have they're like quiet you lowest rank no rights and i'm

6811
05:13:15,690 --> 05:13:25,690
like you're right especially then even less well i think
last map like we're just like not like getting value out of

6812
05:13:25,690 --> 05:13:31,010
bad olds like we're just like not we didn't like win a
single side also impossible to get a value out of gambit

6813
05:13:31,010 --> 05:13:37,050
olds because you can't really like it doesn't matter they
still touch cards like the problem is we gambit old we walk

6814
05:13:37,050 --> 05:13:51,830
on backline but they touch card like bro they show it's also
no it's over it's ggs yeah yeah we're done we did three

6815
05:13:51,830 --> 05:13:53,010
games yeah

6816
05:13:59,870 --> 05:14:00,230
kid.

6817
05:14:00,790 --> 05:14:01,390
I mean, it's hard.

6818
05:14:01,650 --> 05:14:03,670
I mean, maybe just need to change the band there.

6819
05:14:04,310 --> 05:14:06,550
I mean, DD is just too good in the full dive, I think.

6820
05:14:07,690 --> 05:14:10,770
And they just play Cap Venom, so they're just like they
never die.

6821
05:14:17,390 --> 05:14:17,970
Yeah, I don't know.

6822
05:14:18,570 --> 05:14:21,830
There's no other... I mean, what they're playing is exactly
what I would want to play.

6823
05:14:22,110 --> 05:14:25,050
Cypher is very aware of that, so...

6824
05:14:25,050 --> 05:14:26,350
They're also like...

6825
05:14:26,350 --> 05:14:26,830
Oh, man.

6826
05:14:27,350 --> 05:14:31,290
Cypher calling out, like, every support ult, like, to just
farm it, it's just so AIDS.

6827
05:14:32,830 --> 05:14:34,950
And then they just go in with it, have time like to start.

6828
05:14:37,910 --> 05:14:39,570
The Sepulfa didn't win them really the game.

6829
05:14:39,810 --> 05:14:42,330
It's just more like the neutral game with the cap, I think.

6830
05:14:42,430 --> 05:14:43,930
Yeah, the stall was...

6831
05:14:43,930 --> 05:14:47,850
Yeah, like we never really killed them when they were
stalling.

6832
05:14:48,070 --> 05:14:52,270
I think maybe we all just turn around when they start
stalling or...

6833
05:14:52,270 --> 05:14:53,810
You got to shoot, you got to shoot through.

6834
05:14:54,210 --> 05:14:56,370
Yeah, I was shooting as well.

6835
05:14:58,970 --> 05:15:06,290
But it was like me, Moxie and Winy both shooting the cap and
venom, but they just rotate so we can't do anything about it

6836
05:15:06,290 --> 05:15:13,330
they're always 1 HP Gambit Mirror because Gambit Mirror is
also losing against Sidebeach it's just better so it's like

6837
05:15:13,330 --> 05:15:19,600
we got Venom and Cap 1 HP so many times like us three but no
one capitalized on it

6838
05:15:24,930 --> 05:15:37,870
it's alright literally like me and Moxie are like Cap slow
Venom slow and then our front line didn't shoot silence

6839
05:15:37,870 --> 05:15:44,850
crickets I was like oh sorry my opinion doesn't matter I
don't know what to change actually like normally we should

6840
05:15:44,850 --> 05:15:46,610
win this we just need to shoot them

6841
05:15:50,530 --> 05:15:57,830
harder I don't know what to say other than that the matchup
looks good we discord the enemy cap control the entire map

6842
05:15:57,830 --> 05:16:07,410
we won't shoot everyone with Phoenix I don't know I mean the
DD did too much I think honestly looking at it that's all

6843
05:16:07,410 --> 05:16:12,410
right They know more than me.

6844
05:16:13,390 --> 05:16:15,570
I feel like my opinion is really much.

6845
05:16:16,490 --> 05:16:19,530
Because I don't really know what, I guess I don't know what
I'm talking about.

6846
05:16:19,810 --> 05:16:21,470
I mean, I'm going over all the options.

6847
05:16:21,630 --> 05:16:25,570
I think for tomorrow we have different vans than we're fine,
but other than that.

6848
05:16:25,570 --> 05:16:27,950
We're also now versing these same teams tomorrow, I don't
think.

6849
05:16:28,010 --> 05:16:29,290
But I think we've versed the other bracket now.

6850
05:16:29,350 --> 05:16:30,710
Yeah, the other bracket, yeah.

6851
05:16:44,180 --> 05:16:45,960
I'm going to head out for now though.

6852
05:16:46,360 --> 05:16:46,960
Gigi's today.

6853
05:16:47,920 --> 05:16:48,320
Gigi's.

6854
05:16:50,600 --> 05:17:01,820
everyone ggs ggs ggs see you see you that's all right i just
think like they're all like the pros they're all just like

6855
05:17:01,820 --> 05:17:10,580
in their own heads about what they should do and what they
shouldn't do i feel like because of that the tunnel vision

6856
05:17:10,580 --> 05:17:18,780
on stuff so like what the things i bring up they're just
like oh you're just a little baby the adults are talking

6857
05:17:26,120 --> 05:17:31,560
Yeah, they're like, little baby, the adults are talking
right now.

6858
05:17:36,300 --> 05:17:36,500
Yeah.

6859
05:17:40,190 --> 05:17:46,910
They didn't say it, but it did sort of felt like it, but,
you know, it's like, I don't know.

6860
05:17:47,090 --> 05:17:51,190
I don't know if I should give my opinions on stuff here,
because it's like...

6861
05:17:51,370 --> 05:18:00,370
I feel like it's not worth much because like it's just met
with silence and I'm just like okay I'll just talk to my

6862
05:18:00,370 --> 05:18:01,670
chat then

6863
05:18:08,150 --> 05:18:14,810
I don't know every time I feel like every time I give my
opinion on something I just get ignored so I feel like I

6864
05:18:14,810 --> 05:18:22,450
don't know it's just like the one time the one time I was
like what can I do I don't know who it was.

6865
05:18:22,870 --> 05:18:24,730
But someone's like, yeah, just use your dome for yourself.

6866
05:18:29,470 --> 05:18:29,950
Yeah.

6867
05:18:36,110 --> 05:18:37,230
I don't know.

6868
05:18:37,530 --> 05:18:39,570
I don't know if I should speak up again.

6869
05:18:39,730 --> 05:18:41,390
Because it sucks, you know?

6870
05:18:41,510 --> 05:18:42,290
Getting ignored.

6871
05:18:43,910 --> 05:18:46,750
Like, like, it's not a good feeling.

6872
05:18:46,990 --> 05:18:51,250
So I'm like, what's the point of talking if I just keep
getting ignored?

6873
05:18:51,690 --> 05:18:52,670
You know?

6874
05:18:58,710 --> 05:19:06,410
yeah i i feel like i speak loud enough i feel like yeah

6875
05:19:10,080 --> 05:19:16,480
i feel like i like i'm speaking as loud as i can and the
loudest i can would just literally be yelling at them but

6876
05:19:16,480 --> 05:19:18,060
like i don't want to yell

6877
05:19:21,980 --> 05:19:27,960
it's not super low though i have it i haven't at my usual
volume.

6878
05:19:28,340 --> 05:19:30,260
I'm just speaking much more soft.

6879
05:19:30,360 --> 05:19:31,920
I guess I'm speaking more softer.

6880
05:19:49,190 --> 05:19:54,350
I just don't think I need a screen to be not ignored because
that's not productive.

6881
05:19:58,300 --> 05:20:08,020
Because it's like um like the thing is, Wynie also brought
it up too, but he was also getting ignored and Moxie was

6882
05:20:08,020 --> 05:20:11,360
also bringing it up but he was also getting ignored.

6883
05:20:11,920 --> 05:20:16,320
So it's like Like the three of us were just like, what do we
do?

6884
05:20:16,680 --> 05:20:21,300
Because we're literally like, like I would hear Wani yelling
being like, guys, come back.

6885
05:20:21,640 --> 05:20:22,140
Come back.

6886
05:20:22,200 --> 05:20:24,520
And it's just me and Moxie coming back.

6887
05:20:25,020 --> 05:20:28,580
Like, like literally.

6888
05:20:30,860 --> 05:20:35,500
Literally, it's just me and Moxie that would turn around and
come back.

6889
05:20:35,560 --> 05:20:39,000
Because Wani would like, Wani would like yell it.

6890
05:20:39,080 --> 05:20:42,340
And then like, I mean, my rock y'all was also pretty bad
too.

6891
05:20:43,740 --> 05:20:53,240
yeah and moxie was also trying to talk a lot too i maybe
it's just synergy issues honestly it is what it is like

6892
05:20:53,240 --> 05:21:03,800
that's what drafting is it's hard to build synergy in
general but you know ggs ggs tomorrow is a new day um we

6893
05:21:03,800 --> 05:21:17,360
gotta remember we gotta remember that you know for me okay i
don't sad that vibes got ruined i'm still trying but i'm i'm

6894
05:21:17,360 --> 05:21:19,500
vibing along while i'm trying yeah

6895
05:21:25,880 --> 05:21:34,260
it is what it is i want to say vibes but then everyone sees
it as a negative connotation now it sucks but i'm still

6896
05:21:34,260 --> 05:21:50,220
trying i'm still trying i'm still trying my best um yeah but
it's like they killed the word i'm still trying to go in

6897
05:21:50,220 --> 05:21:59,280
with positive vibes it was frustrating just being ignored
like me and my other support being ignored a lot um because

6898
05:21:59,280 --> 05:22:09,200
like i don't know i don't know what to do like i feel like i
do i like i'm trying to play for my life but like it's not

6899
05:22:09,200 --> 05:22:10,920
working i don't know what to do

6900
05:22:14,220 --> 05:22:24,240
yeah like me and my other support we are trying to play for
our lives but it's it's so frustrating too we did we did

6901
05:22:24,240 --> 05:22:33,080
whiny and i did we were like i don't know what i i mentioned
it so many times too and moxie is with me too the peel but

6902
05:22:33,080 --> 05:22:35,500
like there's not much you can do yeah

6903
05:22:39,220 --> 05:22:47,200
uh we all have to fight for our lives and i'm just like If
I, like, piece away too far, too, from my gambit, I, we die,

6904
05:22:47,480 --> 05:22:49,500
because we have, we can't move away too much.

6905
05:22:51,600 --> 05:22:51,880
Yeah.

6906
05:22:52,520 --> 05:22:56,840
Like, we mentioned several times that we need help, but I
don't know.

6907
05:22:56,960 --> 05:22:58,360
Maybe that's just dive meta.

6908
05:22:59,260 --> 05:23:00,740
Maybe that's just dive meta.

6909
05:23:01,000 --> 05:23:02,940
We're, like, it's just, fuck it.

6910
05:23:02,980 --> 05:23:03,840
Goodbye supports.

6911
05:23:05,400 --> 05:23:10,480
It's like, the supports just live long enough to fucking
die, I guess.

6912
05:23:10,580 --> 05:23:11,200
Maybe, I don't know.

6913
05:23:11,220 --> 05:23:12,260
I don't play dive meta.

6914
05:23:14,020 --> 05:23:22,680
maybe that's just that's just what dive meta is like you
just for like let the supports just collapse and just hope

6915
05:23:22,680 --> 05:23:41,430
that you get they killed them before they kill us yeah yeah
moxie helped a lot moxie was trying to help us yeah i'm not

6916
05:23:41,430 --> 05:23:45,490
used to dive and i'm not but like this is a dive team

6917
05:23:50,490 --> 05:23:52,870
super chat thank you thank you

6918
05:24:03,830 --> 05:24:08,770
i don't know i'll talk to boga about it later

6919
05:24:17,210 --> 05:24:26,590
i don't know i'm not used to that meta i guess maybe it's
just my experience too yeah i'm trying to shake off the

6920
05:24:26,590 --> 05:24:32,810
shake off the negativity right now i'm trying to go back to
happy-dokie

6921
05:24:36,390 --> 05:24:44,650
no I just wanted to ask him what I can do to be like to just
be like guess happier

6922
05:24:51,070 --> 05:25:04,630
you know I was like what I can do to be happier How do I be
happy?

6923
05:25:15,370 --> 05:25:17,030
You should, oh I should.

6924
05:25:18,090 --> 05:25:19,350
How to be happy.

6925
05:25:22,070 --> 05:25:23,890
I want to go to Clauboring Club.

6926
05:25:24,050 --> 05:25:25,450
Oh yeah, do you guys see Clauboring Club?

6927
05:25:25,870 --> 05:25:27,990
I know what I can do to make myself happy.

6928
05:25:28,750 --> 05:25:29,390
Watch this.

6929
05:25:33,250 --> 05:25:36,410
It was just frustrating, I guess.

6930
05:25:37,270 --> 05:25:41,250
I was clobbering club.

6931
05:25:41,630 --> 05:25:42,290
Did you guys see it?

6932
05:25:42,370 --> 05:25:44,350
It's like, it's literally a parody of Fight Club.

6933
05:25:44,850 --> 05:25:45,690
I'm surprised they were able.

6934
05:25:45,770 --> 05:25:46,970
Okay, this is what I do.

6935
05:25:48,350 --> 05:25:50,350
There's a lot of console players.

6936
05:25:54,030 --> 05:25:56,030
I looked at it last night.

6937
05:26:01,380 --> 05:26:02,620
All right, Diamond.

6938
05:26:03,420 --> 05:26:03,580
Okay.

6939
05:26:06,920 --> 05:26:13,720
oh there she is all right all right where is that where are
they oh there you are

05:26:26,020 --> 05:26:39,380

6941
05:26:39,380 --> 05:26:42,360
like they're just gonna go tank I'm just gonna get shit on.

6942
05:26:43,660 --> 05:26:43,980
Alright.

6943
05:26:47,520 --> 05:26:48,260
Fuck it.

6944
05:26:48,660 --> 05:26:52,560
If I get shit on by a silver, it is what it is.

6945
05:26:56,620 --> 05:27:01,680
Guys, most likely I'm gonna get karma in my ass and he's
gonna play fucking tank or some shit.

6946
05:27:02,840 --> 05:27:03,400
And...

6947
05:27:03,400 --> 05:27:04,920
My order is sharp.

6948
05:27:05,340 --> 05:27:07,220
My mind is sharper.

6949
05:27:07,840 --> 05:27:10,880
Bro, he's gonna play tank or something.

6950
05:27:11,560 --> 05:27:13,540
And then I'm gonna get my ass beat.

6951
05:27:14,320 --> 05:27:16,000
Oh my god, I fucking knew it.

6952
05:27:16,000 --> 05:27:17,000
I'm gonna get my ass beat.

6953
05:27:17,960 --> 05:27:19,000
Oh my god.

6954
05:27:19,100 --> 05:27:19,700
What do I do?

6955
05:27:19,820 --> 05:27:21,080
I have so little HP.

6956
05:27:22,140 --> 05:27:24,480
I'm gonna get my ass beat.

6957
05:27:26,460 --> 05:27:26,740
Whoa.

6958
05:27:31,770 --> 05:27:33,590
Oh my god, this is actually unfair.

6959
05:27:38,130 --> 05:27:39,010
You smart.

6960
05:27:39,370 --> 05:27:39,930
He knows.

6961
05:27:42,310 --> 05:27:42,870
Here we go.

6962
05:27:42,870 --> 05:27:45,170
Yeah, that's right!

6963
05:27:49,740 --> 05:27:50,360
Alright.

6964
05:27:51,180 --> 05:27:52,580
Alright, let's...

6965
05:27:52,580 --> 05:27:54,060
Now I don't know what to play.

6966
05:27:54,700 --> 05:27:57,620
Honestly, that was the only DPS I know how to play.

6967
05:27:59,380 --> 05:27:59,840
Alright.

6968
05:28:01,000 --> 05:28:01,940
Let me... wait.

6969
05:28:03,320 --> 05:28:04,860
Let's go Call of Duty.

6970
05:28:05,640 --> 05:28:06,540
Oh, shit.

6971
05:28:20,100 --> 05:28:20,720
Hello.

6972
05:28:21,710 --> 05:28:22,960
I will stay here.

6973
05:28:25,360 --> 05:28:26,080
Yeah!

6974
05:28:35,840 --> 05:28:37,400
This brings me...

6975
05:28:37,400 --> 05:28:39,660
See, maybe that's the secret of happiness.

6976
05:28:41,180 --> 05:28:42,640
I think I found it.

6977
05:28:44,840 --> 05:28:46,240
I think I found it.

6978
05:28:46,400 --> 05:28:47,360
It is what it is.

6979
05:28:49,820 --> 05:28:51,160
Alright, back to...

6980
05:28:51,160 --> 05:28:52,900
Gotta scout it out now.

6981
05:28:53,560 --> 05:28:55,920
I gotta scout out my next victim.

6982
05:28:56,700 --> 05:28:57,140
Alright.

6983
05:29:03,290 --> 05:29:04,570
Where is he?

6984
05:29:05,150 --> 05:29:05,870
You.

6985
05:29:14,110 --> 05:29:15,970
Come on.

6986
05:29:25,030 --> 05:29:26,670
Let's go.

6987
05:29:31,100 --> 05:29:33,640
This isn't the way.

6988
05:29:34,560 --> 05:29:36,720
It's the only way.

6989
05:29:40,360 --> 05:29:42,600
I bring my grief on to others.

6990
05:29:43,580 --> 05:29:44,280
Me sad.

6991
05:29:44,620 --> 05:29:45,620
Now you sad.

6992
05:29:48,760 --> 05:29:52,320
I look at you differently after this.

6993
05:29:55,880 --> 05:29:56,660
Me sad.

6994
05:29:57,420 --> 05:29:58,260
You sad.

6995
05:29:59,380 --> 05:30:00,540
Oh my god, what if it is a smurf?

6996
05:30:06,880 --> 05:30:08,180
Oh my god, I think you quit.

6997
05:30:09,720 --> 05:30:10,340
Okay, there we go.

6998
05:30:10,480 --> 05:30:10,780
It's okay.

6999
05:30:10,840 --> 05:30:12,020
I didn't die to a bronze.

7000
05:30:12,440 --> 05:30:13,240
I didn't die to...

7001
05:30:18,420 --> 05:30:19,040
It's okay.

7002
05:30:19,280 --> 05:30:21,360
I didn't die to a bronze guy.

7003
05:30:22,320 --> 05:30:23,240
It's a spy.

7004
05:30:24,340 --> 05:30:26,060
What if I'm in the sky?

7005
05:30:26,920 --> 05:30:28,660
Do I have fly down?

7006
05:30:28,900 --> 05:30:29,820
I don't know.

7007
05:30:32,760 --> 05:30:33,220
I don't know.

7008
05:30:33,880 --> 05:30:34,980
Do I have fly down?

7009
05:30:35,480 --> 05:30:36,080
I don't know.

7010
05:30:36,500 --> 05:30:37,060
I don't know.

7011
05:30:37,920 --> 05:30:39,400
Oh, it's time to find out.

7012
05:30:50,190 --> 05:30:50,510
Oh.

7013
05:30:51,310 --> 05:30:52,130
There we go.

7014
05:30:52,310 --> 05:30:53,730
Yay, I flew up.

7015
05:30:58,720 --> 05:30:58,940

7016
05:31:00,020 --> 05:31:00,500

7019
05:31:12,330 --> 05:31:14,370
One more just to be happy.

7020
05:31:17,570 --> 05:31:18,950

7021

7063
05:33:50,810 --> 05:33:52,310
This might be harder.

7064
05:33:52,450 --> 05:33:53,550
She's gold, guys.

7065
05:33:53,950 --> 05:33:55,630
She might fuck me up.

7066
05:33:58,110 --> 05:33:59,890

05:34:03,030 --> 05:34:04,590

05:34:07,450 --> 05:34:09,490
From toddler to child.

Oh my god, is that actually karma?

7083
05:35:41,650 --> 05:35:42,250
There's no way.

7084
05:35:42,450 --> 05:35:43,710
Karma doesn't exist for me.

7085
05:35:45,430 --> 05:35:47,290
Oh my god, is that actually karma?

7086
05:35:51,370 --> 05:35:52,890
No, it's not.

7087
05:35:56,430 --> 05:35:57,470
No, it's not.

7088
05:35:57,650 --> 05:35:59,550
Karma doesn't exist for me.

7089
05:36:01,850 --> 05:36:02,170
Yay!

7090
05:36:06,810 --> 05:36:07,570

I'm legally allowed to challenge them based off their rank.

7103
05:37:12,020 --> 05:37:14,800
See, they could have kept their profile private like this

7104
05:37:15,460 --> 05:37:15,900
Oh, Platt.

7105
05:37:16,100 --> 05:37:17,320

05:37:19,340 --> 05:37:21,020
Ooh, that's like an adolescent.

I'll let anyone fight me.

05:37:48,140 --> 05:37:49,740
But only if your rank is low.

7119
05:37:51,480 --> 05:37:53,320
Only if you have a low rank.

05:37:54,080 --> 05:37:55,580

05:38:29,410 --> 05:38:30,490
Where is he?

7134
05:38:32,030 --> 05:38:33,230
I'll find you.

7135
05:38:33,310 --> 05:38:33,930
Don't worry.

7136
05:38:35,730 --> 05:38:36,950
I gotta fly, though.

7137
05:38:43,010 --> 05:38:43,990
We're sticky.

7138
05:38:45,150 --> 05:38:46,690
Okay, best game.

7139
05:38:46,830 --> 05:38:48,790
His name was Sticky, something, something.

7140
05:38:50,030 --> 05:38:50,670
Where is he?

7141
05:38:52,470 --> 05:38:53,670
Oh, Sticky.

7142
05:38:56,070 --> 05:38:57,550
Wait, he's not here.

7143
05:38:59,770 --> 05:39:01,050
Oh, there you are.

7144
05:39:01,630 --> 05:39:02,330
Hey, Sticky.

7145
05:39:05,650 --> 05:39:07,530
One of them will say yes.

7146
05:39:08,450 --> 05:39:11,310
One of them will let me fight.

7147
05:39:14,950 --> 05:39:18,870
I found him oh

7148
05:39:22,350 --> 05:39:26,070
no they kicked out all the kids

7149
05:39:29,850 --> 05:39:48,110
all the kids are gone i beat up too many children wait i see
pet no i don't understand maybe here all the kids left

7150
05:39:52,050 --> 05:39:54,450
Wait, I'll find...

7151
05:39:57,740 --> 05:40:00,240
All the children left!

7152
05:40:00,580 --> 05:40:01,160
Oh wait, nice.

7153
05:40:01,460 --> 05:40:01,720
Here.

7154
05:40:02,480 --> 05:40:03,540
I'm not gonna fight my own level.

7155
05:40:03,700 --> 05:40:06,700
I literally just lost like, I literally lost two matches.

7156
05:40:06,940 --> 05:40:07,780
Fuck that shit.

7157
05:40:08,320 --> 05:40:10,000
This is the only way I can win.

7158
05:40:11,940 --> 05:40:20,490
Because even though my opinions didn't matter, didn't
matter, I know here that I rank above the kids.

7159
05:40:22,900 --> 05:40:28,840
At least I know, at least I know that I rank above these
children.

7160
05:40:30,120 --> 05:40:31,700
My opinion matters here.

7161
05:40:33,940 --> 05:40:35,940
I'm just reclaiming what I lost.

7162
05:40:36,460 --> 05:40:37,200
Forever, Rex.

7163
05:40:38,840 --> 05:40:40,440
Where's Forever, Rex?

7164
05:40:41,640 --> 05:40:43,180
Oh my god, there's too many.

7165
05:40:43,360 --> 05:40:44,860
Oh my god, I actually don't like that.

7166
05:40:44,940 --> 05:40:46,100
There's too many flashes.

7167
05:40:47,480 --> 05:40:48,260
Where is he?

7168
05:40:50,160 --> 05:40:51,120
Forever, Rex.

7169
05:40:51,200 --> 05:40:52,680
I know you're here.

7170
05:40:53,740 --> 05:40:55,600
I saw your rank and it's perfect.

7171
05:41:02,120 --> 05:41:04,080
There's too many high rank players.

7172
05:41:04,400 --> 05:41:07,080
Well, high rank as in like, there's too many adolescents.

7173
05:41:09,460 --> 05:41:13,040
I'm here to beat up the children, not the actual adults.

7174
05:41:16,400 --> 05:41:18,700
Or like, well, more like teenagers, I would say.

7175
05:41:18,760 --> 05:41:19,780
Oh, GXR.

7176
05:41:20,980 --> 05:41:22,240
GXR, where are you?

7177
05:41:22,440 --> 05:41:23,240
Oh, there you are.

7178
05:41:23,320 --> 05:41:23,900
I'm coming.

7179
05:41:27,450 --> 05:41:29,570
Wait, did I fought this person before?

7180
05:41:29,750 --> 05:41:30,190
I don't remember.

7181
05:41:30,350 --> 05:41:30,590
I lost.

7182
05:41:30,970 --> 05:41:32,850
Did all the kids blend in together?

7183
05:41:34,710 --> 05:41:39,770
All the kids actually blend in together.

7184
05:41:40,330 --> 05:41:40,790
Yeah!

7185
05:41:44,540 --> 05:41:47,120
Will I get Carmen again?

7186
05:41:54,370 --> 05:41:56,750
I'm the biggest kid on the playground.

7187
05:41:58,310 --> 05:41:58,930
That's me!

7188
05:42:03,170 --> 05:42:03,990
That's me!

7189
05:42:11,870 --> 05:42:13,710
Oh my gosh, she's playing Phoenix.

7190
05:42:13,930 --> 05:42:14,190
Wait.

7191
05:42:24,330 --> 05:42:25,130
Wait a minute.

7192
05:42:26,450 --> 05:42:27,370
She hit that.

7193
05:42:27,670 --> 05:42:28,010
Wait.

7194
05:42:31,230 --> 05:42:32,430
Wait a minute.

7195
05:42:36,510 --> 05:42:37,950
Oh no, she's bad.

7196
05:42:42,510 --> 05:42:44,850
Okay, I was just like, Wait a minute.

7197
05:42:45,610 --> 05:42:46,550
She's hitting shots.

7198
05:42:47,070 --> 05:42:48,750
I don't know if I like that.

7199
05:42:50,570 --> 05:42:50,610
Alright.

7200
05:42:53,970 --> 05:42:56,330
Alright, I got closer and then she didn't know what to do.

7201
05:42:56,450 --> 05:42:58,850
Okay, this is one of my worst characters.

7202
05:42:59,170 --> 05:42:59,910
So maybe...

7203
05:43:00,730 --> 05:43:02,690
Oh shit, okay, maybe she'll...

7204
05:43:03,890 --> 05:43:05,030
Maybe she'll fuck me up.

7205
05:43:05,110 --> 05:43:05,590
I don't know.

7206
05:43:06,530 --> 05:43:07,690
This is actually my worst cut.

7207
05:43:09,790 --> 05:43:11,310
I mean, it's point and shoot.

7208
05:43:11,350 --> 05:43:13,470
Well, it's not my worst, but like, you know what I mean.

7209
05:43:16,690 --> 05:43:18,630
If I'm like not... Oh, it doesn't...

7210
05:43:18,630 --> 05:43:24,490
I was just gonna say, damn, GG.

7211
05:43:25,730 --> 05:43:26,370
Thanks.

7212
05:43:33,290 --> 05:43:33,670
Yeah!

7213
05:43:34,790 --> 05:43:35,470
One more.

7214
05:43:35,910 --> 05:43:37,110
I'm feeling it.

7215
05:43:38,650 --> 05:43:40,590
I'm feeling it now.

7216
05:43:41,730 --> 05:43:42,790
Alright, where are...

7217
05:43:42,790 --> 05:43:44,570
Alright, more victims.

7218
05:43:45,650 --> 05:43:46,670
More victims.

7219
05:43:46,690 --> 05:43:58,010
um hello I wish you could challenge them from here Oh shark
bait Where is he oh there you are

7220
05:44:01,840 --> 05:44:06,900
You see I don't want to do a pub public duel because I'm not
here to give my money away

7221
05:44:12,600 --> 05:44:15,300
This is a real player what do you mean?

7222
05:44:16,580 --> 05:44:23,720
This is a real player Oh, yeah, you know what time it is,
kids.

7223
05:44:24,860 --> 05:44:27,960
I don't know what you're talking about.

7224
05:44:29,620 --> 05:44:33,380
Even though they're silver, they're just as real as you and
I.

7225
05:44:33,820 --> 05:44:36,780
Are you trying to say silver players don't have rights?

7226
05:44:37,700 --> 05:44:40,000
They're just as real as you and I.

7227
05:44:40,940 --> 05:44:41,580
Oh, my God.

7228
05:44:41,740 --> 05:44:42,360
Not the rogue.

7229
05:44:42,960 --> 05:44:44,600
I've never played against a rogue before.

7230
05:44:45,500 --> 05:44:46,440
Like, DPS.

7231
05:44:47,820 --> 05:44:48,640
Oh, my God.

7232
05:44:58,870 --> 05:44:59,470
Okay.

7233
05:45:08,650 --> 05:45:09,250
Yay.

7234
05:45:18,510 --> 05:45:19,110
Update.

7235
05:45:23,350 --> 05:45:26,630
Guys, they accepted that duel.

7236
05:45:27,110 --> 05:45:27,410
Oh, fuck.

7237
05:45:27,490 --> 05:45:28,670
No, I can't actually can't.

7238
05:45:28,770 --> 05:45:30,810
I don't know if I fight against a spot or met.

7239
05:45:31,350 --> 05:45:33,770
They didn't have to accept that duel.

7240
05:45:39,470 --> 05:45:40,710
Oh, my God.

7241
05:45:40,850 --> 05:45:42,310
I actually got...

7242
05:45:42,310 --> 05:45:42,710
I don't know.

7243
05:45:42,730 --> 05:45:49,710

7244
05:45:54,040 --> 05:46:04,100
all right i think i actually might get karma i'm gonna lose
to a child oh no don't look don't oh okay

7246
05:46:28,310 --> 05:46:29,130
This is bad.

7247
05:46:29,930 --> 05:46:30,530
This is actually...

7248
05:46:30,530 --> 05:46:31,890
He went dead!

7249
05:46:37,850 --> 05:46:38,830
He went dead!

7250
05:46:38,950 --> 05:46:44,730
What the f- It's okay.

7251
05:46:45,530 --> 05:46:45,970
It's okay.

7252
05:46:46,770 --> 05:46:47,850
It's just one of...

7253
05:46:47,850 --> 05:46:49,170
He was smurfing, guys.

7254
05:46:49,970 --> 05:46:51,270
Guys, he was smurfing.

7255
05:46:51,770 --> 05:46:52,770
He was smurfing.

7256
05:46:53,090 --> 05:46:54,450
He was smurfing everyone.

7257
05:46:56,870 --> 05:47:01,370
This is like when you're going death match and the guy pulls
up a fucking diva.

7258
05:47:01,990 --> 05:47:02,710
It's just like that.

7259
05:47:02,810 --> 05:47:03,330
That's it.

7260
05:47:03,730 --> 05:47:04,370
That's it.

7261
05:47:04,910 --> 05:47:22,360
another guy I'm picking another child that's fucking it okay
that gots to that's it I'm finding a bronze player guys he

7262
05:47:22,360 --> 05:47:37,320

can't believe people was fucking smurf in Dua I can't

7263
05:47:37,340 --> 05:47:37,840
believe it.

7264
05:47:38,160 --> 05:47:39,940
Do they have no honor?

7265
05:47:42,320 --> 05:47:44,420
No honor at all.

7266
05:47:52,410 --> 05:47:53,370
That's how I'm picking tank.

7267
05:47:53,570 --> 05:47:54,470
I've learned my lesson.

7268
05:47:56,710 --> 05:47:57,670
I've learned my lesson.

7269
05:47:59,770 --> 05:48:00,110
No!

7270
05:48:00,990 --> 05:48:01,430
No!

7271
05:48:06,270 --> 05:48:09,050
I actually don't know how to play tank, so this is going to
be interesting.

7272
05:48:10,630 --> 05:48:13,590
I don't know, How do you play tank?

7273
05:48:14,830 --> 05:48:15,290
Actually.

7274
05:48:16,650 --> 05:48:18,930
I've never actually played tank before.

7275
05:48:20,470 --> 05:48:21,010
Fuck it.

7276
05:48:38,330 --> 05:48:39,250
Is this cheating?

7277
05:48:57,720 --> 05:48:58,800
Oh.

7278
05:49:06,140 --> 05:49:06,580
That's right.

7279
05:49:06,700 --> 05:49:08,400
This is why I picked you.

7280
05:49:20,520 --> 05:49:22,540
Oh my god, how do you play this character?

7281
05:49:28,590 --> 05:49:30,270
I can never die.

7282
05:49:30,510 --> 05:49:31,970
My HP is so high.

7283
05:49:36,890 --> 05:49:37,490
Yeah!

7284
05:49:44,430 --> 05:49:45,990
I figured it out.

7285
05:49:47,410 --> 05:49:48,730
I figured the system.

7286
05:49:48,990 --> 05:49:49,670
All right, one more.

7287
05:49:50,230 --> 05:49:52,110
One more with my new strat.

7288
05:49:53,170 --> 05:49:55,170
I figure out the strat, guys.

7289
05:49:56,290 --> 05:49:58,070
This is the last one for real.

7290
05:49:59,550 --> 05:50:01,030
It's called my...

7291
05:50:03,790 --> 05:50:06,330
It's called the tank strat.

7292
05:50:06,650 --> 05:50:07,430
It's literally...

7293
05:50:08,070 --> 05:50:13,770
It's literally deathmatch where you some fucker will play
Diva in a deathmatch.

7294
05:50:15,730 --> 05:50:18,070
Pizza rules for me.

7295
05:50:19,190 --> 05:50:20,930
Where is the guy?

I need, like...

7299
05:51:00,790 --> 05:51:01,690
Alright, last one.

7300
05:51:01,770 --> 05:51:02,690
This one's for real.

7301
05:51:08,020 --> 05:51:08,700
Where is that?

7302
05:51:08,780 --> 05:51:10,340
Oh, there you are, little Jeff.

7303
05:51:11,460 --> 05:51:12,260
Come on.

7304
05:51:14,460 --> 05:51:15,440
Come on.

7305
05:51:15,660 --> 05:51:16,160
Oh!

7306
05:51:16,580 --> 05:51:17,100
What?

7307
05:51:18,540 --> 05:51:19,980
He closed it?

7308
05:51:20,120 --> 05:51:21,200
Why are you here?

7309
05:51:23,040 --> 05:51:25,640
Why are you here if you're not here to duel?

7310
05:51:28,900 --> 05:51:31,120
Like, you might as well uninstall.

7311
05:51:35,750 --> 05:51:36,770
He knows.

7312
05:51:37,290 --> 05:51:37,490
Coward.

7313
05:51:38,210 --> 05:51:40,330
I say as I'm here beating up children.

7314
05:51:43,050 --> 05:51:45,130
No, but he's the coward, guys.

7315
05:51:45,410 --> 05:51:45,930
Not me.

7316
05:51:48,310 --> 05:51:50,290
I'm willingly choosing this.

7317
05:51:51,390 --> 05:51:53,470
Did I beat up Cookie God yet?

7318
05:51:54,930 --> 05:51:56,430
Whiskey in a can.

7319
05:52:01,650 --> 05:52:03,090
Whiskey in a can.

7320
05:52:03,290 --> 05:52:03,870
Where is he?

7321
05:52:07,250 --> 05:52:08,230
Where is he?

7322
05:52:09,970 --> 05:52:10,930
Where is this man?

7323
05:52:12,250 --> 05:52:13,090
He's silver.

7324
05:52:13,390 --> 05:52:14,150
Oh, there he is.

7325
05:52:17,470 --> 05:52:17,950
Yeah!

7326
05:52:24,660 --> 05:52:25,220
Come on.

7327
05:52:25,500 --> 05:52:26,580
Take my challenge.

7328
05:52:30,450 --> 05:52:32,410
There's no one want to fight me no more.

7329
05:52:32,530 --> 05:52:33,290
I don't understand.

7330
05:52:35,690 --> 05:52:36,310
That's it.

7331
05:52:36,370 --> 05:52:37,470
I'm rerunning it.

7332
05:52:40,650 --> 05:52:41,370
It's okay.

7333
05:52:41,430 --> 05:52:44,510
I can find a I have a new identity.

7334
05:52:48,750 --> 05:52:48,950
It's okay.

7335
05:52:49,150 --> 05:52:50,130
I grabbed a new identity.

7336
05:52:51,750 --> 05:52:51,790
Alright.

7337
05:52:52,790 --> 05:52:54,410
They have yet to hear my tails.

7338
05:53:02,820 --> 05:53:03,700
Where is he?

7339
05:53:05,820 --> 05:53:06,780
Let's see.

7340
05:53:09,700 --> 05:53:10,460
Where is he?

7341
05:53:10,460 --> 05:53:11,140
Oh, there he is.

7342
05:53:15,990 --> 05:53:19,410
He has yet to hear of my tails.

7343
05:53:22,570 --> 05:53:22,990
Okay.

7344
05:53:23,150 --> 05:53:24,770
He doesn't know yet.

7345
05:53:26,090 --> 05:53:26,550
He has not.

7346
05:53:26,630 --> 05:53:27,950
He doesn't know my legacy.

7347
05:53:30,510 --> 05:53:31,550
My record.

7348
05:53:33,170 --> 05:53:34,070
The red idiot.

7349
05:53:47,880 --> 05:53:48,600
I don't understand.

7350
05:53:50,100 --> 05:53:51,700
I just want to one silly duel.

7351
05:53:53,340 --> 05:53:54,740
I'm not here to hurt nobody.

7352
05:53:54,940 --> 05:53:56,820
Just a one tiny silly duel.

7353
05:54:00,280 --> 05:54:01,000
Alright, don't worry.

7354
05:54:01,080 --> 05:54:01,560

05:54:42,850 --> 05:54:44,710
Don't ask me to fight.

7361
05:54:44,910 --> 05:54:46,630

7362
05:54:50,650 --> 05:54:52,410

You have a chance to win.

7369
05:55:10,510 --> 05:55:13,370
It's not like you're gonna lose or anything.

7370
05:55:13,790 --> 05:55:17,690
It's all, you know, everyone has a chance.

7371
05:55:17,990 --> 05:55:21,910

Because I don't know.

7382
05:56:23,160 --> 05:56:24,700
Preteens are like a wild ball.

7383
05:56:25,500 --> 05:56:27,980
Preteens and teenagers are wild balls.

7384
05:56:29,420 --> 05:56:32,280

7412
05:57:33,470 --> 05:57:34,710
Oh my god, you're so tiny.

7413
05:57:34,930 --> 05:57:35,770
Who are you?

7414
05:57:37,570 --> 05:57:38,550
Oh, no, you're flat.

7415
05:57:40,030 --> 05:57:41,410
Where's that other motherfucker?

7416
05:57:42,970 --> 05:57:44,770
He walked by me.

7417
05:57:50,030 --> 05:57:53,030
Nobody wants to pay for a duel.

I'm going to teach you a lesson today.

7423
05:58:50,510 --> 05:58:52,630
Never accept invites from random strangers.

7424
05:58:53,830 --> 05:58:55,390
Because they're going through a lot right now.

7425
05:58:59,330 --> 05:59:00,810

7426
05:59:02,270 --> 05:59:02,650
Oh, wait.

7427
05:59:02,770 --> 05:59:03,330
What the fuck?

7428
05:59:06,930 --> 05:59:07,490
That's right.

7429
05:59:07,610 --> 05:59:08,370

05:59:17,000 --> 05:59:17,420
Bam!

7431
05:59:21,260 --> 05:59:24,640
Never accept invites from random people.

7432
05:59:25,860 --> 05:59:26,080
Alright.

7433
05:59:27,220 --> 05:59:28,220
I don't know.

7434
05:59:28,640 --> 05:59:29,100
That's Thor.

7435
05:59:29,360 --> 05:59:30,300
How do I play with Thor?

7436
05:59:30,760 --> 05:59:32,220
We're going to learn a tank here.

7437
05:59:33,340 --> 05:59:36,840
I know Thor is like strong, but I literally don't know any
of his movesets.

7438
05:59:40,850 --> 05:59:41,910
Oh, shit.

7439
05:59:42,410 --> 05:59:44,510
I actually don't know any of his movesets, by the way.

7440
05:59:44,570 --> 05:59:46,830
I've never played this guy before in my life.

7441
05:59:47,690 --> 05:59:48,750
I'm learning here.

7442
05:59:49,810 --> 05:59:50,290
Okay.

7443
05:59:55,790 --> 05:59:56,230
Ah!

7444
06:00:03,390 --> 06:00:04,790
Oh my god, how the fuck?

7445
06:00:07,890 --> 06:00:08,770
I'm low.

7446
06:00:11,650 --> 06:00:12,370
Where is she?

7447
06:00:12,650 --> 06:00:13,250
Where is she?

7448
06:00:13,630 --> 06:00:14,070
Yeah!

7449
06:00:19,040 --> 06:00:19,480
Yay!

7450
06:00:20,460 --> 06:00:21,940
Oh my god, I didn't even use this.

7451
06:00:22,120 --> 06:00:23,440
This would have been so strong.

7452
06:00:23,840 --> 06:00:25,620
I didn't even use this because I didn't even...

7453
06:00:25,620 --> 06:00:26,780
That's right, that's BM.

7454
06:00:27,540 --> 06:00:27,980

Yeah!

7457
06:00:36,920 --> 06:00:38,600
I didn't even need to use it.

7458
06:00:38,740 --> 06:00:39,940
I literally nerfed myself.

7459
06:00:40,020 --> 06:00:40,640
You know what?

7460
06:00:41,100 --> 06:00:43,220
I'm going to fight the first person I see.

7461
06:00:43,560 --> 06:00:45,220
That's how confident I am.

7462
06:00:45,820 --> 06:00:46,640
Right here.

7463
06:00:52,450 --> 06:00:54,930

7468
06:01:05,630 --> 06:01:06,510
Oh, what?

7469
06:01:06,630 --> 06:01:08,370
I'm gonna fight you.

7470
06:01:10,250 --> 06:01:11,870
I don't even know you're ranked.

7471
06:01:15,850 --> 06:01:17,390
I don't even know you're ranked.

7472
06:01:19,010 --> 06:01:20,730
I just went and asked for it.

7473
06:01:22,070 --> 06:01:22,830
Look at that.

7474
06:01:25,250 --> 06:01:25,690

7479
06:01:41,750 --> 06:01:43,330
You don't know that.

7480
06:01:47,130 --> 06:01:48,650
He could be smurfing.

7481
06:01:50,070 --> 06:01:51,090
You know, unless we do.

7482
06:01:51,990 --> 06:01:54,350
I literally went up to the first guy I saw.

7483
06:02:00,090 --> 06:02:02,110
Oh, Squirrel Girl is like her favorite character.

7484
06:02:08,870 --> 06:02:10,310

06:02:57,330 --> 06:02:57,870
people.

7491
06:02:58,110 --> 06:02:59,710
How am I the monster?

7492
06:02:59,770 --> 06:03:02,790
I don't know

7493
06:03:07,130 --> 06:03:07,670
I'm pushing this.

7494
06:03:08,230 --> 06:03:10,310
I'm grabbing a shield for myself.

7495
06:03:12,390 --> 06:03:13,730
I need a shield.

7496
06:03:15,190 --> 06:03:15,770
There you go.

7497
06:03:25,850 --> 06:03:27,270
Oh shit, he's using a shotgun.

7498
06:03:27,410 --> 06:03:27,890
I forgot.

7499
06:03:28,390 --> 06:03:30,370
Never do close range against a Punisher.

7500
06:03:35,840 --> 06:03:36,900
My box.

7501
06:03:40,060 --> 06:03:41,240
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

7502
06:03:42,420 --> 06:03:42,620
Yeah.

7503
06:03:51,080 --> 06:03:51,280
Yeah!

7504
06:03:54,660 --> 06:03:55,720
Did you want to level something?

7505
06:03:55,860 --> 06:03:59,320
Now they know how I felt when I'm, like, the non-pro player
at this tournament.

7506
06:04:00,840 --> 06:04:06,320
Now they know how I feel as a non-pro player in this
tournament.

7507
06:04:09,220 --> 06:04:12,340
I will never, I will not stop the cycle.

7508
06:04:14,540 --> 06:04:16,900
I continue the cycle.

7509
06:04:21,940 --> 06:04:22,840
Look, how is this?

7510
06:04:23,420 --> 06:04:24,540
He didn't rival me.

7511
06:04:28,020 --> 06:04:30,180
Alright, what is your E though, actually?

7512
06:04:34,060 --> 06:04:34,760
Look, see?

7513
06:04:35,500 --> 06:04:38,340
I'm willing to challenge a level...

7514
06:04:39,000 --> 06:04:40,140
A level...

7515
06:04:40,140 --> 06:04:41,160
A diamond player.

7516
06:04:41,280 --> 06:04:42,240
I'm literally...

7517
06:04:42,340 --> 06:04:44,820
Challenging a teenager right now.

7518
06:04:47,580 --> 06:04:48,820
Look at that.

7519
06:04:49,780 --> 06:04:50,260
Look at that.

7520
06:04:50,380 --> 06:04:52,280
This guy's Grandmaster.

7521
06:04:57,600 --> 06:04:57,900
Alright.

7522
06:05:00,620 --> 06:05:00,920
See?

7523
06:05:02,320 --> 06:05:02,940
See?

7524
06:05:03,720 --> 06:05:07,540
I'm literally fighting someone that's a Grandmaster now.

7525
06:05:07,780 --> 06:05:09,020
Look, I'm not bullying children.

7526
06:05:10,580 --> 06:05:12,100
I swear to God, he plays tank though.

7527
06:05:12,340 --> 06:05:13,020
It's sharper.

7528
06:05:17,110 --> 06:05:19,430
This is an actual 1v1 now.

7529
06:05:22,250 --> 06:05:23,910
Oh my god, Scarlet Witch, really?

7530
06:05:24,030 --> 06:05:24,990
Oh my god, wait, it counters.

7531
06:05:25,590 --> 06:05:26,970
Scarlet Witch is a counter of Scythe.

7532
06:05:31,730 --> 06:05:34,190
Oh shit, wait, I was supposed to do his...

7533
06:05:34,190 --> 06:05:35,910
Wait, am I late to his totemachi?

7534
06:05:38,110 --> 06:05:40,110
Oh my god, tell him I'm beating up children right now.

7535
06:05:40,310 --> 06:05:40,870
Now I'll join the VC.

7536
06:05:42,930 --> 06:05:44,550

06:06:44,060 --> 06:06:44,640

That should not be...

7550
06:07:01,470 --> 06:07:03,630
I feel like you should ban tanks, honestly.

7551
06:07:03,770 --> 06:07:05,330
Or, like, it should be, like...

7552
06:07:08,390 --> 06:07:10,290
Like, if it's tank versus tank...

7553
06:07:23,970 --> 06:07:31,250
