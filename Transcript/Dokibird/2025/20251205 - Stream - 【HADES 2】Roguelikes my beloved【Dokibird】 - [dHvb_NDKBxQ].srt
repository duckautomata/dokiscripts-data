1
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:53,950
Hello, hello I know it's been a while I just said I was
going to I was going to say I was like Oh, I'm going to take

2
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:59,470
a couple of days off Because my social battery was really
low And then I ended up disappearing for like half the week

3
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:04,010
So I have a perfectly good explanation for this For those
who don't follow me on Twitter And we're like, what the fuck

4
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:04,850
happened to her?

5
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:14,190
And also don't look at my community posts But basically I
don't know what I did But in the beginning of the week I

6
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:19,050
fucked up my tooth I don't and it's like And it's like the
back molars too.

7
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,470
So it's not painful.

8
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,250
Like, it's not really painful, painful.

9
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,510
Well, like, okay, if I like put pressure on it, it is.

10
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,190
But like, it's very rare that I would put pressure on it.

11
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:32,970
I could eat very fine.

12
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:38,330
Like, if I switch cold water, like, I don't feel any pain
from switching cold water on it.

13
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,610
So, I don't know what I did.

14
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:52,750
But I think I like, I think I it i think because when i was
like getting my tongue to feel around it there is a oh god

15
00:02:52,750 --> 00:03:07,110
oh god i just touched it i i can't help it i touched it um
it is movable which is concerning one of the pieces is

16
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:22,170
movable so i and it feels it feels so weird so one of the
pieces I think, because like, when I first didn't I crack,

17
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:33,690
when I got my tongue, um, like when I used my tongue to feel
it, um, it like, it like, I could feel like a lie, you know?

18
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:37,590
Like, I was like, this is, I was like, this is one tooth.

19
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:41,470
Why do I feel a line across that tooth?

20
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:45,190
So I got really worried because I was like, this is not
normal.

21
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,130
So, yeah.

22
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:54,610
I called and made an appointment, but the earliest
appointment I could get was on Tuesday.

23
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:59,390
So I gotta wait till Tuesday to, like, have that looked at.

24
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,270
So I'm tanking it right now.

25
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:01,730
Don't worry.

26
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:05,430
Like I said, it's not painful.

27
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:11,750
I am, like, very paranoid right now, because I am, like,
rubbing my tongue around my teeth, not just, like, the,

28
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:19,870
like, I'm trying to avoid the, I'm trying to avoid the,
like, the affected tooth, but I am, like, super paranoid and

29
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:25,010
anxious now because I read remember I told you guys I read
this thing where like if you rub your tongue against your

30
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:32,610
teeth it's actually bad for your teeth because you'll end up
eroding it and uh eroding it and also like pushing your

31
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:40,190
teeth too much but I can't help ever since I read that and
then what happened to my tooth I keep rubbing my tongue

insurance since I was little they so I just I've just been

49
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:34,250
like it's just been a gotcha whether or not I'll get sick
guys I didn't even have a fam like I've never I haven't had

50
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:44,610
a family doctor since I was 10 because like because like
that's when we started moving around So they're like you

51
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:53,750
don't need a family doctor We'll just go to a doctor
whenever you're sick and like you'll never get sick So No,

52
00:07:54,210 --> 00:08:02,450
no one's even more messed up You know Canadians technically
have free health care My mom never renewed my health care

53
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:06,470
card since I was seven That

54
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:18,750
up the hard way Cause like um Cause like you know I had to
go to the hospital I'm glad to go to the hospital for some

55
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,210
stuff.

56
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:21,110
And, oh yeah, for a checkup.

57
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:27,070
Yeah, because you guys remember I had that cough thing for a
very long time.

58
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:30,710
So, like, I wanted to go to the hospital to get medication
for it for my seasonal asthma.

59
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,170
And then I think this was, like, last year.

60
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:38,030
And then, like, I gave them my care card.

61
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:41,670
Because all Canadians technically have a care card.

62
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,810
And then they looked at my care card.

63
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,790
And they're like, man, this card.

64
00:08:47,730 --> 00:09:01,490
like has like this card is very expiring and i was just like
huh and they're like yeah um we your card like is very old

65
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:07,710
and like we don't use this card anymore for those who don't
know so the old there's a new care card system in canada now

66
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:15,450
where it's like um you can i don't remember what it is but
it's like it has a photo on it so my care card is a very old

67
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:22,690
version expired for more than a decade so like I have the
really old care card where it just has the number the your

68
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:31,750
insurance like the health number and um and the new care
card is the one where it has a photo of you so I don't have

69
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:41,710
that because my care card um is so old that like I have
apparently um it expired when I was like seven or eight

70
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:42,450
years old

71
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,120

90
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,320

your care card renewed at the Canadian DMV.

92
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:41,620

Like, I should stop doing that.

135
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:06,800
Like, I just want to like chomp down because my like when
like two feels weird i just want to be like i know i

136
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:12,660
shouldn't touch it it's like it's like when you have a scab
wound and you want to pick it like you're like you know you

137
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:22,820
know it's bad you know it's so bad but you just want to pick
it because you're like what if it just gets better like like

138
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:30,000
maybe if i destroy the scab the skin will just heal itself
you know like that's how i that's how i still am i'm like

139
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:37,160
what if i just pick it or like when you're like supposed to
squeeze a pimple and you're like oh but what if you know

140
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:42,720
you're not supposed to squeeze or scratch this pimple
because it'll uh first off uh it's really bad because like

141
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,800
it might spread to somewhere else because it's like you know
the reason why it's a pimple is because all the bacteria um

142
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:54,200
all the bacteria grows in that one spot so you're not
supposed to push on it or scratch it because then it could

143
00:16:54,200 --> 00:17:01,140
lead to uh we can lead somewhere else on your face um but
then you're like thinking okay but when if i pop it though

144
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:10,240
oh and also it'll scar it to that's how you get scars um so
so like i can't help it it's like i just wanted oh i just

145
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:20,180
wanted to go um uh bourbon thank you thank you thank you
okay but what if yeah but what if i'll just wash my hands

146
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:27,640
after right that's how it works um angriest thank you with a
super chat thank you thank you i see a lump on your gum line

147
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:33,040

148
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:39,580

the it's like literally the furthest tooth at the very back

00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:50,680

bottom jaw it's very easy to see it but it's like the it's

150
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:59,080

151
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:07,420
um so like i don't know what's going on But yeah, if it's a
root canal, I'm, I, oh my gosh, I'm just going to expect the

152
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:11,740
worst because I feel like today, this year has been a very
unlucky year for me.

153
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:16,080
Because of course, I was like, oh, what's the worst that can
happen at the last month of the year?

154
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,260
Like, oh, my, the bad year is almost over.

155
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:26,500
And then, of course, I fuck up my tooth on the last, on the
last month.

156
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,420
I fuck up my tooth.

157
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,520
Yeah, thank you for the super chat.

158
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:31,920
Thank you.

159
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,440
Of course I jinxed.

160
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,820
I was like, oh, the year's almost over.

161
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,940
Surely nothing else bad is going to happen to me.

162
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,820
Then I had to crack my tooth somehow.

163
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,620
I don't know how, but it just happened.

164
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,740
Thank you for the super chat.

165
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:51,140
Thank you.

166
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:51,940
Thank you.

167
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,580
Yeah, right on the last month.

168
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,400
Thank God it wasn't during the holidays.

169
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,760
Because I had to wait for the dentist to come back for
Christmas or the New Year's or some shit.

170
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,460
Oh, yeah, I got one more in me the new the year.

171
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:14,820
Yeah, so that's why I've been missing for half the week
because, like, I was just, like, it was just bothering me so

172
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,120
much.

173
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,700
And I was like, oh, I think, and I've got the appointment.

174
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,660
And I was like, and then appointment is like next week.

175
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,500
So I was just like, oh, fuck, I can tank this.

176
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,440
Because it's not painful yet.

177
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,220
That's just like, it's just annoying when I'm talking.

178
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:33,120
Like, sometimes I could feel like the presence of that, too.

179
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,380
But sometimes I don't, like right now, I don't feel it.

180
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,420
Right now, it feels normal.

181
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,280
But, like, it would just randomly, like, show itself.

182
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,740
It'd be like, oh, you're not paying attention to me.

183
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:46,260
And it starts, like, like, I guess, like, it just starts
throbbing.

184
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,360
But not painful throb.

185
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,320
Just be, like, pay attention to me, throb.

186
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,940
Yeah, and I should get a new card, too.

187
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,300
I should really get a new care card.

188
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:57,060
I should be back in the system.

189
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:04,420
Because they're like, oh, there's always, whenever I go do
some, like, health stuff, they'll be like do you have your

190
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:11,300
care card with you and i was like yeah i was like no because
like um you know they're like oh so and then they assume you

191
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:18,000
just want it off the record because obviously if you have
your care card thing like medication and prescriptions are a

192
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:25,200
lot cheaper so they'll just they're like oh you want it off
like off your receipt you don't want it in your records i

193
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:34,160
was like yeah i don't want it in my yeah yeah definitely i
just i just don't want it in It's not like I don't exist in

194
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:34,740
the records.

195
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,840
I just don't want it in my records.

196
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,410
Riki, thank you for the super chat.

197
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:44,490
Thank you, thank you.

198
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:48,430
Actually, I prefer my crown to my realty, but wishful
thinking, maybe they can just fuse it.

199
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:49,310
Thank you for the super chat.

200
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,270
Thank you, thank you.

201
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:56,330
They don't know that I might not have a record, so they just
think I want it off the record.

202
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,850
James, thank you for the super chat.

203
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:01,630

Um, anyway, guys, Hades time!

208
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:46,470
Um, so, I did spoil myself a little bit, because apparently
a lot of people, I saw the reviews, and apparently a lot of

209
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:49,070
people are very disappointed in the ending.

210
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:55,070
Like, everyone likes, like, the gameplay and everything, but
apparently the ending is very...

211
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,070
Oh, is it loud?

212
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:56,830
Oh, shit.

213
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:57,690
Sorry, guys.

214
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:58,530
Ha-ha.

215
00:21:59,150 --> 00:21:59,550
All right.

216
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:00,810
I don't know, Sound Guy.

217
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,110
Sound Guy, are you alive?

218
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:04,450
Um, did it fix it?

219
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,430
Oh, they changed it already.

220
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:14,510
is better okay that's good never mind jk when did they fix
it when did they oh they fixed it oh oh my god i thought the

221
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:22,390
game was fully released was it recently oh they reconned it
nice okay that's good see that's one that see guys see it's

222
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:31,890
good to like wait not play it on release especially for
katies i knew like um oh a month ago okay that's good i knew

223
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:37,310
like okay for games like okay i'm gonna tab out for games
like haiti's the reason why i didn't play out like didn't

224
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:43,090
play while they were updating it because like you know um
they had early access and everything and i didn't even play

225
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:48,930
when the game fully released is that i knew they were gonna
keep patching it like i felt like haiti's was the type of

226
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:55,110
game that they were gonna keep patching it keep changing
things over and over again so like that's why i didn't

227
00:22:55,110 --> 00:23:02,250
bother to play it for a while um so that's why like i waited
until then because they always fixed a lot of things they

228
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:08,670
always like kept patching and everything and i just want to
experience it um as the game that they want me to experience

229
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:17,550
it versus like them recording everything because i feel like
i don't want to come back to it you know i i didn't want to

230
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:24,290
like come back they're like like forced me to come back to
it because i'm like when i finish the game it's finished

231
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:32,830
like it's like how maybe I'll finally play Tarkov because
you can finally escape from Tarkov.

232
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:40,030
Did you guys know that the game has finally released like
this month last month or some shit and they they finally put

233
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:43,890
a mission in there where you can escape from Tarkov.

234
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:56,150
Yeah it ends there's actually an end game like yeah I saw
like yeah it actually has an end game and after after five

235
00:23:56,150 --> 00:24:00,450
plus years You can finally escape from Tarkov.

236
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:03,830
No way.

237
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:05,130
Title drop.

238
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:09,710
Yeah.

239
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,710
They finally added that in.

240
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:18,590
So last month and people were like making it a big deal
because it definitely takes, it took this guy two weeks.

241
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:22,850
It took like this like pro escape from Tarkov streamer.

242
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:27,590
Two weeks of nonstop playing to complete the mission.

243
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:36,730
to escape from Tarkov and I was just like bro what do you
mean it takes two weeks of like five like I don't know ten

244
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:50,790
plus hours of gaming to escape from fucking Tarkov like yeah
so I'm like oh my god we're just yeah just that fucking

245
00:24:50,790 --> 00:25:00,130
mission of and he got the bad ending dude that's like you
can see that's so fucking long and there's one out of four

246
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:08,630
and just walk out five have you has he ever considered just
flying out you know has ever considered just walking out

247
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:18,450
there's clearly Tarkov can't be that big guys what if he
just walks out yeah it took two weeks of non-stop playing

248
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:29,850
just to get the worst ending possible while escaping anyway
Anyway, let's play Hades too.

249
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,730
I hope Sound Guy is here.

250
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:32,810
Oh my god.

251
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:35,210
Wait, where, which one is?

252
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,670
I would assume it's the 11th?

253
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,390
Okay, why do I have two saves?

254
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:41,790

00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:48,530
What is, what, what does this mean?

258
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,730

I got all my stuff, though.

285
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:51,890
I...

286
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:57,550
A few tales of whose reign as grim lord of the dead came
to...

287
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:58,350
All right, here you go.

288
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:08,130
once his past caught up with him i don't think it did
because everything's at a hundred history repeats see guys

289
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:11,050
pure pressure and bullying works guys

290
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,060

feel like this weapon was not in the early access.

296
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,940
This weapon is too good.

297
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:17,690
It was?

298
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,410
Okay, maybe I definitely forgot everything.

299
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:28,350
The thing I love about this game the most is that I don't
have the voice act.

300
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:33,010
Alright.

301
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:34,510
What do I get?

302
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:37,750
Your attack deals more damage in larger areas.

303
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:52,250
faster whatever you cast expires restore it I feel like more
damage more damage is always good but more damage is always

304
00:28:52,250 --> 00:29:03,990
nice all right yeah money I feel like I have not I did
definitely did not use this as my main weapon I'm like I

305
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:10,550
don't remember I don't remember this There you go.

306
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,430
Oh, what did I get?

307
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:15,010
What is this?

308
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:16,610
Mostly used to unlock.

309
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:17,610
Oh, yeah, that's why.

310
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:18,530
Alright.

311
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:20,710
Back up.

312
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:21,710
We go.

313
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:26,990
Are the enemies new?

314
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:30,290
I'm just like, wait, are you new?

315
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,370
Guys, I literally don't remember.

316
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:35,230
You're like, you look new.

317
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:37,710
And then they're like, they've always been in this game,
Doki.

318
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,530
Are you new?

319
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:43,010
No.

320
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,370
Oh, hey, golden coin.

321
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:49,230
Money.

322
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:50,290
Yippee.

323
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:55,670
Our new stuff is mostly later.

324
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:56,030
Okay.

325
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,250
Okay, I remember these guys.

326
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:00,530
These guys I remember.

327
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:05,230
Okay, there's a lot of things on my screen right now.

328
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:06,530
No, not.

329
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:07,370
Oh, shit!

330
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,070
Oh, fuck.

331
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:08,370
Okay.

332
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:09,010
That's fine.

333
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:10,410
I still have a lot of HP.

334
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:11,630
God, I hate the clutter.

335
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:15,050
Clutter is the fucking worst.

336
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:17,110
Okay, nice.

337
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:17,850
More ashes.

338
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:19,850
Wait, what's this?

339
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,390
Okay, this is...

340
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:23,470
Oh, this is the heart... Okay, this is money.

341
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:24,530
Shop?

342
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:25,670
Okay, let's get an upgrade.

343
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,410
I can charge my cat.

344
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:28,330
Oh!

345
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,130
Oh, okay.

346
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,430
Well, wasted that.

347
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:33,250
Oh, it's a screen off-center?

348
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:34,790
No, it is.

349
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:35,750
Oh, wait, it is.

350
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:38,810
Oops.

351
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:43,310
Wait, is it?

352
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:44,190
Oh, shit.

353
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:45,110
Oopsie.

354
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:47,790
That means Rivals was off-center, too.

355
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:52,250
Is it better now?

356
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:56,370
That means I streamed Rivals last, like, on Tuesday.

357
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,150
It was also...

358
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:58,310
Wait, actually, was it?

359
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,630
Okay, I gotta check this out.

360
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:01,070
How bad was it?

361
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:04,590
How off-centered was Rivals when I streamed it for seven
hours?

362
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:05,390
I don't think...

363
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:07,810
I like how nobody noticed it, too, for Rivals.

364
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:08,550
That's the best part.

365
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:08,810
part.

366
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:11,230
Oh, it wasn't that.

367
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:13,430
Wait, yeah, it wasn't that noticeable.

368
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:15,190
Oh, wait, it is.

369
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:17,910
It is the top part.

370
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:19,830
Wait, is it?

371
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:20,990
Oh, yeah, no.

372
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:25,110
You can tell because, like, nobody noticed it, too.

373
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,070
That's the best part.

374
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:28,090
It's just slightly weird.

375
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:30,290
You guys are just so distracted by Venom.

376
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:33,650
No one noticed that Rivas was also offset.

377
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:36,590
I like how everyone noticed in the 80s.

378
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:43,870
Oh, shit.

379
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:47,790
Okay, this...

380
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:48,650
Oh, what the?

381
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:49,870
What the fuck?

382
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:50,650
Okay, okay, okay.

383
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:52,370
Okay, I don't know how to kill.

384
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:53,870
Okay, that was unlucky.

385
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,150
Oh, okay.

386
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,270
I just got it.

387
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:58,230
Wee!

388
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,190
Okay.

389
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:01,630
This is actually bad.

390
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:02,310
I think I might be.

391
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:02,830
No, I'm dead.

392
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:04,850
I'm so dead.

393
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:10,950
Oh my god, this is so bad for me.

394
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:12,570
Okay, it's okay, it's okay.

395
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:13,690
Everything is fine.

396
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:16,630
Oh, whoops, sorry.

397
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:18,250
I did just skip her.

398
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:21,990
Oh, yeah, the reason why...

399
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:22,270
Oh.

400
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:26,550
I shall freeze hell in its entirety if that is what it takes
to get her back.

401
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:27,590
I'm so healthy.

402
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:31,390
Okay, so...

403
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:38,090
The reason why the rival's bot got, like, copyright muted is
because apparently this...

404
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:45,050
The Rivals song that they sing in Times Square is, um, is,
uh, what's it called?

405
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,550
It's DMCA-able.

406
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:55,370
So, so, which is crazy because it's, it's like, because like
Rivals at Twitch have such a close relationship.

407
00:32:56,030 --> 00:33:03,030
So I didn't, like, it's fucking crazy that the songs, the
main Rivals Day song is like copyrightable.

408
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,440
Grandmother.

409
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,860

We'll get that.

416
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,100
Okay, so I'm not feeling very healthy.

417
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:48,120
I am not feeling healthy at all.

418
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:55,300
Okay, as long as, like, he doesn't touch me, we should be
fine.

419
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:58,520
Wee!

420
00:33:59,400 --> 00:33:59,800
Okay.

421
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,600
That is fine.

422
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,460
As long as they don't get near me.

423
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:04,540
No touchy.

424
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,880

00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:35,980
You know what?

456
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:36,840
You're right.

459
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,460
I died.

460
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,580
I'm going back.

461
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,700
Did they add anything?

462
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:56,040
Okay, but first off, before I go back, did they add anything
new in the beginning?

463
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:00,120
Cal would it do it.

464
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,060
You guys want to know what happens in the beginning?

465
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:07,540
You guys wanted to know you can watch the first five.

466
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:15,240
I think they, I feel like they don't, Oh no, why don't you
find up?

467
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:22,010
Please stay.

468
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:26,130
Who dares to stir my eternal rest?

469
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:32,670
Also, everything was a hundred during the last save.

470
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:35,210
So like, I turned it up by a bit though.

471
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:37,810
So like...

472
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:39,970
Alright, so this was the options for audio.

473
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,110
It's literally all a hundred.

474
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,900
Alright, they added more trees.

475

514
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:50,370
Can you stay there for a little longer?

515
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:52,610

You're one of my father's brothers, aren't you?

Then help him.

552
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:45,170
In the name of Hades, Olympus, I accept this message.

553
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:47,290
Oh, okay, wait.

554

Music to 60%.

00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:56,350

Okay, that should be good.

563
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:06,530
And then we'll raise overall.

564
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:10,950
Uh, all right, let me know if it's better.

565
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,940
Yeah, the only thing I remember was Aphrodite.

566
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,900
We thought you met the same fate as your father.

567
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:29,280
for poor old Hades and his kin.

568
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:31,920
Alright, don't worry.

569
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,080
Don't worry, Uncle.

570
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,260
I'll do that.

571
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:38,500
Your cast also meaning you hit foes with powerful splash and
like fourth.

Your special hit foes with a splash and knock out your
attack hit foes.

So I don't know how long I'll be playing this for today.

589

Alright.

596
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:49,340
Uh, Poseidon.

597
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:50,660

598
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:52,860

00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,340
Max mana?

603
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:01,780
I don't think I need that.

604
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:03,660
I'll go get Poseidon.

605
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,140
I'll talk to my uncle.

606
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:10,730
I need to stop using my...

607
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:12,030
I need to stop using my mana.

608
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:14,270
Because my mana...

609
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:16,270
Because if I hold it, it takes out my mana, right?

610
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:19,470
I feel like that's such a waste.

611
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:21,450
Alright.

612
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:23,410

No touchy.

623
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:09,310
No touchy because I don't regen.

624
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:10,350
Or do I?

625
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:11,850

626
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:14,150

00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:18,250
Alright, refreshes every rune so I can be more...

628
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:20,870
more relaxing with my magic.

629
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:23,210
Boon time!

630
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:26,230
Wave strikes, your attack hits first.

631
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:27,790
I'm gonna do a water strike.

632
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:29,890
What's this?

633
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:31,110
Is that Apollo?

634
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:32,630
Do Apollo.

635
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:39,010
Boom.

636
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:39,650
Actually...

637
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:39,890
Okay.

638
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:40,850
Might as well.

639
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:43,250
I haven't used Q yet.

640
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:46,290
Alright.

641
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:47,610
Boom!

642
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:49,550
Okay.

643
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:52,230
These guys are slow, so it'd be easy to kill.

644
00:46:53,590 --> 00:46:53,690
See?

645
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:54,290
Look at him.

646
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:55,370
Just standing there.

647
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:56,110
Fucking idiot.

648
00:46:57,210 --> 00:46:57,730
Apollo!

649
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:00,650
Do bind your time, sunshine.

650
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:04,870
The Titan thinks he has us pinned, but we have the situation
here under control.

651
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:07,030
Just locked in a bit of a stalemate is all.

652
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:08,250
Yeah, it'll be okay.

653
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:10,770
That's why we're depending it all on this bastard child.

654
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:13,010
A blinding rush.

655
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:16,070
Your sprint is faster and flicked days on surrounding foes.

656
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:19,650
Whenever your cast expires, restores magic.

657
00:47:20,450 --> 00:47:23,810
Your cast expands in size until they expire.

658
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:25,290
Do we want to recover?

659
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:27,230
Two, right?

660
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:28,170
For the recovery?

661
00:47:30,270 --> 00:47:33,070
She's explicitly not a bastard.

662
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:34,490
Oh my god, fucking course.

663
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:35,730
It gives me Aphrodite.

664
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:38,110
Well, yeah, I say that.

665
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:39,090
Sorry, sorry.

666
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:41,570
My dad was the bastard child.

667
00:47:44,350 --> 00:47:44,910
Sorry.

668
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:46,610
It was my father.

669
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:48,870
Shit, I need free forgetting about it.

670
00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:52,070
God damn it.

671
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:53,250
Are you fucking okay?

672
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:58,740
It's fine.

673
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:03,060
Okay, we still do.

674
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:03,800
Nice.

675
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:09,180
In the name of Hades.

676
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,220
Olympus, I accept this message.

677
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,000
Alright, nice.

678
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,220
Alright, you get your...

679
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:16,960
Whoa.

680
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,600
See, that's why we all remember Aphrodite.

681
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:28,060
Alright.

682
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,560
Your special deals more damage to you.

683
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:41,620
nearby foes your cast inflicts weak and damaged foes while
dragging them towards the center rushing damages i feel like

684
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:51,760
rapturing right inflict weak because it's an epic i wasn't
done admiring right we should get that one too i have much

info oh it's just like what upgrades I got for my stuff.

686
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:04,640
Wait, what did I get for this?

687
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:05,300
Your cast?

688
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:06,800
That's my cue, right?

689
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:09,800
Yeah, I need to use my cue more.

690
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:12,060
Bam!

691
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,340
Oh, shit!

692
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:18,360
Okay, I'm... Okay, maybe I should use my cue less.

693
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:24,460
Okay.

694
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:27,000
Like, the cue actually almost fucked me up there.

695
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:30,280
Uh, that's heals, right?

696
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:32,560
Oh, What's this one again?

697
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:34,880
It immediately fumbles.

698
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:36,500
What is this one?

699
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:38,240
Oh, give some more upies.

700
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:39,380
Okay, no problem.

701
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,000
All right, I brought it up a bit more.

702
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:42,580
HP?

703
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:45,780
I feel like more max HP.

704
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,360
I have enough money for items, I'm pretty sure.

705
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:49,780
Right?

706
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:51,060
Shop tab.

707
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:53,420
Oh, wait, you must have art now.

708
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:54,700
Oh, he has art.

709
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:55,520
Remember him?

710
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,020
He used to be, like, question mark.

711
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,420
I'm in your debt, Lord Karan.

712
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:01,560
Yeah, he has.

713
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:02,380
He has art now.

714
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:09,140
Can I borrow some money?

715
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:14,360
Please, I'm so poor.

716
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,040
Plus 12.

717
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:18,940
I mean...

718
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:20,160
Oh my god, he actually has...

719
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:20,980
Wait, what's this?

720
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:21,920
Wait, that's new.

721
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,120
What is that?

722
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:24,240
He looks so cool.

723
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Yeah, I'm broke.

724
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:27,960
I'm broke right now.

725
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:29,080
I only have $81.

726
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:30,860
I mean, I might as well just buy the food.

727
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:32,560
I don't have money anyway.

728
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:36,920
Yeah, I'm princess of hell is poor right now.

729
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:40,880
Brokey bird.

730
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:44,880
Yeah, he was a play solo during the first early access.

731
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:45,760
What's this?

732
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:47,740
I've never seen this one before.

733
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:50,140
Ash?

734
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:51,300
This is ash, right?

735
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:52,400
But what is this, though?

736
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:57,020
They're just upgrade stuff?

737
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:57,780
I'll just get ash.

738
00:50:58,660 --> 00:50:58,960
Then.

739
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:01,700
Yeah, because we're still in early.

740
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:02,560
Anyway.

741
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,680
Like, there's no way I'm gonna get it.

742
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:05,720
get through this run.

743
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:09,840
Toki, you just gotta believe in your- No, no, this is my
second run.

744
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:10,640
There's no way.

745
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,100
I- Oh, shit.

746
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:18,000
I have trouble believing that we're gonna make it through
the second run.

747
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,160
We're gonna get to the end.

748
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:22,900
What was this?

749
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:23,900
Wait, what's this?

750
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:26,960
Yeah, I believe.

751
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:28,820
Are more upies?

752
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:32,700
All right, I updated a little bit more.

753
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:33,760
Is this money?

754
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:34,680
All right, let's go to Aphrodite.

755
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:36,940
Where are you freaks out there?

756
00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:44,310
Oh.

757
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:45,850
Oh, wait.

758
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:46,710
I'm not hitting him.

759
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:50,950
I'm like, why am I not doing damage?

760
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:51,910
I don't understand.

761
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:55,970
Okay.

762
00:51:57,330 --> 00:51:59,510
Oh my god, I have to hold it for so long.

763
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:01,790
Goodness.

764
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:04,010
Alright.

765
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:04,830

Jesus Christ.

772
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:43,330
Why is there like 20 fucking notes on this?

773
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:48,710
I am an anti now for Aphrodite.

774
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:51,230
Oh!

775
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:53,750
Okay, that's cool.

776
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:55,310
It costs less.

777
00:52:58,950 --> 00:52:59,570
Ash, right?

778
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:00,110
Yeah, Ash.

779
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:00,630
Oh, hey.

780
00:53:01,230 --> 00:53:01,590
Yoink.

781
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:03,370
I'm gonna steal your plants.

782
00:53:11,110 --> 00:53:11,990
There you go.

783
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:16,810
Alright, nice.

784
00:53:16,910 --> 00:53:18,390
Oh, I don't have a lot of magic.

785
00:53:18,510 --> 00:53:19,550
I just realized that.

786
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:22,410
But I'm stronger, right?

787
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:24,210
It's worth it, right?

788
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:24,990
I'm stronger.

789
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:29,290
But it means I'm stronger.

790
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:32,470
Okay.

791
00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:35,690
Makes mad unusual for this run.

792
00:53:36,370 --> 00:53:37,750
Wait, then what's the fuck is that point?

793
00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:41,450
Yeah, but I should be stronger with it.

794
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:45,530
Okay, heart, chop.

795
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:47,790
I have not... I don't think I can afford anything.

796
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:48,550
I only have $90.

797
00:53:49,550 --> 00:53:51,570
I'm just gonna grab... I'll grab Max Health.

798
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:54,510
Yeah.

799
00:53:58,350 --> 00:54:00,530
I'll grab Health just because I don't have...

800
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:04,870
Um... I don't even have like... Oh shit, we're at there.

801
00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:06,390
Okay, we're gonna get absolutely destroyed.

802
00:54:09,350 --> 00:54:09,990
God's mistress.

803
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:10,930
Hello.

804
00:54:11,350 --> 00:54:12,290
There she is.

805
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:15,630
Oh, it's a test before she sends me out to the real world.

806
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:18,230
Dang it.

807
00:54:18,290 --> 00:54:19,110
Thank you for the super chat.

808
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:19,490
Thank you.

809
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:19,950
Thank you.

810
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:24,370
I like the art in this game, but I always bother me how
everyone looks like they have some mutant form of super and

811
00:54:24,370 --> 00:54:24,810
Juanese.

812
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:26,070
What's super Juanese?

813
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:28,970
I could not have reached this point without your guidance.

814
00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:35,030
And in turn, you shall not pass this point without a
demonstration on the game.

815
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:36,790
Please, Hecatee, I don't have insurance.

816
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:39,810
My capability.

817
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:44,710
You'd have us face each other here, even though my task has
already begun.

818
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:59,270
Training shall never be complete and I would know if you
stand any chance at all against our enemy Yeah Don't

819
00:54:59,270 --> 00:54:59,750
remember it.

826

Okay, that's fine.

Okay.

834
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:48,840

835
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:52,180

839
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:28,740
Okay.

00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:32,820
Okay.

841
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:35,520
Oh,

842
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:50,990

843
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:56,730
Okay, it's fine Where is she?

844
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:05,820

848
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:26,000
Oh,

849
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:29,790

00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:17,590
Restore, please.

856
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:19,870
Oh, just 11 HP.

857
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:20,630
That's fine.

858
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:22,510
That's all I need.

859
00:58:24,930 --> 00:58:28,750
See, present Doki is a better gamer than past Doki.

860
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:30,390
See, I leveled up.

861
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:36,080
Oh, I remember.

862
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:36,600
I hated this.

863
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,040
This is the bad area, too.

864
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:41,060
I remember I hated this boss.

865
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:42,260
Good music, though.

866
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:45,500
The underworld plunges deeper than the deepest sea.

867
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:49,720
Yet there are such places where the edge of one and the
other meet.

868
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:53,840
I just remember the band was really hard.

869
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:59,340
I also...

870
00:58:59,340 --> 00:58:59,700
Oh, yeah.

871
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:00,840
No, I'm so fucking weak.

872
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:01,200
Yeah.

873
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:04,420
Holy fuck.

874
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:05,420
Oh, my God.

875
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:06,900
I'm so weak in this area.

876
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:08,220
Oh, my God.

877
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,760
I'm not supposed to be here, guys.

878
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:13,300
I barely do any damage.

879
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:16,040
Holy shit.

880
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:17,700
Like, why are you here?

881
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,020
You're not supposed to be here yet.

882
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:20,160
Like, I'm dull.

883
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:21,560
I know I'm not.

884
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:23,880
Please forgive me.

885
00:59:27,590 --> 00:59:28,790
Okay, it's fine.

886
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:33,520
Alright, nice.

887
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:36,300
Oh my god, they take fucking forever to kill.

888
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:39,880
Okay, nice.

889
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:43,000
I think not.

890
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:44,660
Oh my god, I stood in front of the trap.

891
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:45,700
I forgot that they do that.

892
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:46,640
I was like, how did I?

893
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:48,460
How am I getting damage?

894
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:51,840
Yeah, I stepped in the fucking...

895
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:54,060
I forgot this was a trap there.

896
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:56,900
This was mana, right?

897
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:57,940
We don't need magic.

898
00:59:58,260 --> 00:59:59,260
I might as well get the boon.

899
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:03,120
Oh, God.

900
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:04,700
What?

901
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:05,020
What?

902
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:05,820
Oh, shit!

903
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,660
I was like, why can't I go anywhere?

904
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:09,280
But it's just...

905
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,040
It's just water.

906
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:11,760
It's just all water.

907
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:14,780
Okay.

908
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:17,000
Let's use this to get...

909
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:17,720
Out of here.

910
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:20,800
Okay, that's fine.

911
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:21,700
Can't touch me.

912
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:24,300
That's right.

913
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:26,620
Can't touch me.

914
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:28,180
I'm so far away.

915
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:29,760
Boon time.

916
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:31,920
Your cast inflicts...

917
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,500
Okay, I should get that to level 2.

918
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:34,980
The cast was really helpful.

919
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:37,620
Uh, I have enough for the shop.

920
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:39,120
Let's just go for the shop.

921
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:41,660
Hello.

922
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:43,240
Aphrodite.

923
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:45,660
Want to talk?

924
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:48,440
Oh, nope, he doesn't want to talk.

925
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:49,900
I mean, we might as well grab this.

926
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:53,500
Oh, now you want to talk to me.

927
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:58,740
Come on, we all have fantasies, gorgeous.

928
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:00,420
All right.

929
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:02,540
Oh, fantasies.

930
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:05,140
All right, your specialty is more damage to nearby.

931
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:06,360
That's my right click.

932
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,660
Gushing damages surrounding flows and fleets weak.

933
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:13,060
And again, once you stop, you deal more damage while you
have at least...

934
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:15,680
One or two or three, chat.

935
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:17,840
carefully.

936
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:22,880
Whoa, fantasies.

937
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:29,320
Rushing damages surrounding foes and flicks.

938
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:30,260
What's rushing damages?

939
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:31,280
Oh!

940
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:32,840
Okay.

941
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:34,380
Oh, it's my dash.

942
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:36,020
Might as well grab everything.

943
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:40,600
Waves strike.

944
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:45,600
Should we level up our two or...

945
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:48,580
Or is two or three?

946
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:51,500
I don't know.

947
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:52,260
We should get...

948
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:52,900
Or attack.

949
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:53,740
Two?

950
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:56,080
Alright.

951
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:57,660
Make our attack stronger.

952
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,160
Poseidon or...

953
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:00,800
Who's that?

954
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:04,120
Is that...

955
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:04,760
Is that...

956
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:05,340
That's not Apollo.

957
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:05,780
That's...

958
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:06,400
Who's that?

959
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:09,080
I don't know who that is.

960
01:02:09,740 --> 01:02:11,140
I'm gonna go to Poseidon.

961
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:12,480
Is that Apollo still?

962
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:14,780
Or is that...

963
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:15,700
That's Apollo?

964
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:16,240
Oh, okay.

965
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:17,080
Okay.

966
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:18,780
Uh, we'll do a Poseidon.

967
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,320
I don't want to fight a boss.

968
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:22,140
Oh, shit!

969
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:26,360
Where did they all come from?

970
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:29,340
It's fine.

971
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,840
Yeah, we're not going into the Elite Room.

972
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:35,180
I'm really weak right now.

973
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:42,100
Oh, hit surrounding foe with a powerful splash as they start
to strike, but you prime 30.

974
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:43,180
Oh, shit.

975
01:02:43,580 --> 01:02:43,580
Okay.

976
01:02:43,940 --> 01:02:44,540
Oh, God.

977
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,520
Do I really need magic?

978
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:51,620
Just, yeah, okay, is this a no magic?

979
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:52,460
Let's do it.

980
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:54,280
Okay, no magic run.

981
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:55,120
Let's go.

982
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:57,740
We don't need magic.

983
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:58,340
Oh, wait.

984
01:02:58,500 --> 01:02:59,020
Who's that?

985
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:00,560
Who's the fire?

986
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:02,200
No, man.

987
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:04,240
Who the fuck needs magic, guys?

988
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:06,300
Oh, this one is not a boss room.

989
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,860
Yeah, the no magic run.

990
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:12,700
Magic's for, oh, shit!

991
01:03:13,220 --> 01:03:14,820
Oh, oh, oh!

992
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:19,180
Yeah, magic's for nerds.

993
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:21,420
Okay, I forgot that's what they do.

994
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:23,180
There we go.

995
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:23,940
Oh, shit.

996
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:25,520
The fire goddess never got involved.

997
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:26,980
In the name of Hades.

998
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:27,640
Oh, shit.

999
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,240
The fire goddess is here.

1000
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,600
Yeah, that is for nerds.

1001
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:34,180
The magic isn't real, right?

1002
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:38,560
That's new.

1003
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:39,540
The art is new, right?

1004
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:40,960
I don't remember her having a hat.

1005
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:43,200
It's all blasted place to the ground myself.

1006

1015
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:51,340
That's projectile cast.

1016
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:51,940
No magic.

1017
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:52,340
Okay.

1018
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:54,340
Don't get one guy.

1019
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:54,920
By who?

1020
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:58,920
The one guy that's telling me that there's no magic or the
one guy that's telling me that it is magic.

1021
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:00,840
There's several one guys here.

1022
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:06,760
3 also nice for bosses.

1023
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:09,200
I think we'll do bosses then.

1024
01:05:09,580 --> 01:05:11,580
I'd rather commit to the... Wait, what's this?

1025
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:12,840
Unseal?

1026
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:14,620
Wait, what's this?

1027
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:17,020
Guys, what is this?

1028
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:19,320
I don't want to...

1029
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:21,580
I'm not going to randomly go into the fucking hole.

1030
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:26,920
I have to know that if this was a horror film, I will walk
away.

1031
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:30,560
If I don't know what it is.

1032
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:32,700
Guys, what is this?

1033
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:37,340
Let's find.

1034
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:38,880
It's fun, Joki.

1035
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:44,460
It's really fun.

1036
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:47,020
It's the fun hole.

1037
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:54,380
All right, let's go into the fun hole, I guess.

1038
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:59,580
All right.

1039
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:03,140
There we go.

1040
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:04,260
Oh, it's Ash.

1041
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:05,140
Which is better?

1042
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:06,600
Ash or honey?

1043
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:07,720
Because that's...

1044
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:09,460
Oh, that's for, like, making friends, right?

1045
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:11,180
So we should go with Ash, right?

1046
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:13,160
Don't call it that.

1047
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:14,900
The happy little skull door.

1048
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:18,640
Honey or ash?

1049
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:19,440
Or nectar?

1050
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:25,380
Okay, next day.

1051
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:31,000
What the fuck does these guys do?

1052
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:33,880
It doesn't look like they do anything.

1053
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:38,560
Yeah, I'm gonna make sure these guys get out of here.

1054
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:39,460
Oh my god.

1055
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:44,200
What the fuck?

1056
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:46,740
Oh my god, the stupid goddamn vets.

1057
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:51,980

1058
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:54,740
Stupid fucking vets.

1059
01:06:55,580 --> 01:06:58,260
Someone fix the fucking ventilation system here.

1060
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:01,620
Oh my god, keep forgetting.

1061
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:02,260
I don't want magic.

1062
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,380
They're like, where are you casting for?

1063
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,240
This is your goddamn no magic run.

1064
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:08,740
You wanted this, Doki.

1065
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:14,320
Jesus.

1066
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:17,920
Okay, that's fine.

1067
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:19,420
I got the nectar.

1068
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:20,920
Oh, hey, Hammer!

1069
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:22,140
Hammer time!

1070
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:23,820
Hammer's always good.

1071
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:25,420
Okay.

1072
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:29,880
I don't remember what it does, but I remember hammer was
good.

1073
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:33,700
Hammer time.

1074
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:39,960
Okay, I'm stuck in...

1075
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:40,480
Oh, shit!

1076
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:44,000
I don't like this area.

1077
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:47,120
I think I'm, like, stuck in this area.

1078
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:49,100
Oh, you fucking!

Hammer time.

1082
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,820

Okay, I think we gotta do 30 plus.

1086
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:07,760
You can channel 30 magic in here special to deal...

1087
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,960
Okay, guys, I think we can only do three.

Of course the first encounter is Aphrodite.

1223
01:18:05,410 --> 01:18:06,930
God, she's so obsessed with me.

1224
01:18:08,110 --> 01:18:10,650
This family isn't so good at letting go, is it?

1225

01:18:22,890 --> 01:18:24,050
Wishing damage surrounds.

Do I get Passion Rush?

1229
01:18:26,150 --> 01:18:26,910
Do I think that's good?

1230
01:18:26,990 --> 01:18:27,970
Or should I save it?

1231
01:18:28,030 --> 01:18:29,830
Or do I, like...

1232
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:31,430
I mean, like, I do a lot of dodge.

1233
01:18:31,570 --> 01:18:32,310
I'm gonna grab two.

1234
01:18:32,730 --> 01:18:34,190
Yeah, guys, she wants me.

1235
01:18:34,430 --> 01:18:35,570

Like, I need to use to hold key more.

1243
01:19:02,210 --> 01:19:04,750
I feel like it'd be much more useful if I do it more.

1244
01:19:05,470 --> 01:19:06,810
I don't know, I'm just so impatient.

1245
01:19:07,990 --> 01:19:09,470
I'm way too impatient for it.

1246
01:19:09,510 --> 01:19:10,330
That's the worst part.

1247
01:19:11,310 --> 01:19:13,470
Why hold when I can damage now?

1248
01:19:13,490 --> 01:19:14,050

01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:02,780
Any more?

1353
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:04,120
That's right, cast!

1354
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:09,060
They gotta make sure they don't start screaming at me.

1355
01:26:10,900 --> 01:26:12,700
God, the range thing is so OP.

1356
01:26:14,620 --> 01:26:15,140
Grandmother.

1357
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:16,280
Hello, grandma.

1358
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:25,900
Your cast inflict freeze and repeal your damage to foe and a
binding circle after remaining active for oh wait this is

1359
01:26:25,900 --> 01:26:39,980
good right okay two or two or one or three I guess three
more three okay cold I like how they're like three and I'm

1360
01:26:39,980 --> 01:26:51,060
like three cold the reason is just cold Alright, alright,
fine.

1361
01:26:51,380 --> 01:26:51,440
Cold.

1362
01:26:52,700 --> 01:26:56,980
Oh, yeah, no, that freeze is good.

1363
01:26:57,180 --> 01:26:57,560
Yeah, you're right.

1364
01:26:57,820 --> 01:26:58,180
Cold is it.

1365
01:26:58,280 --> 01:26:58,900
Cold was good.

1366
01:26:59,060 --> 01:27:00,440
Cold was a good reasoning, guys.

1367
01:27:02,660 --> 01:27:03,180
You're right.

1368
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:04,320
Cold was good.

1369
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:07,760
Alright.

1370
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:10,520
Otherwise, you can just stand here.

1371
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:14,320
Pack steal more damage and inflict freeze.

1372
01:27:14,460 --> 01:27:15,680
I should get that as level 2.

1373
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:17,740
Or strike it.

1374
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:19,080
The double.

1375
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:21,960
Yeah, if they can't hit you, you can't die.

1376
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:23,620
Never tell this Doki.

1377
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:25,400
Do I get two or one?

1378
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:26,000
One?

1379
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:28,200
Is it 75%?

1380
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:33,860
Guys, if we keep doubling this, we'll never get the actual
stuff.

1381
01:27:36,860 --> 01:27:38,480
Two of you won the gap.

1382
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:39,160
Okay, fine.

1383
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:40,160
Fine.

1384
01:27:44,620 --> 01:27:48,100
Two for Doki, but the Gamba though.

1385
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:54,260
But we guys, if we keep increasing it, We'll never actually
get items!

1386
01:27:58,560 --> 01:27:59,200
Yeah.

1387
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:04,100
Can't increase it forever!

1388
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:10,500
Alright, nice.

1389
01:28:11,140 --> 01:28:12,080
Ascent to a heart.

1390
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:12,540
Yay!

1391
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:15,560
We should be able to afford the shop now.

1392
01:28:16,540 --> 01:28:18,740
Maybe we can have double the shop items.

1393
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:19,560
Is that possible?

1394
01:28:20,540 --> 01:28:21,160
It's Keron.

1395
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:22,740
Hello.

1396
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:25,740
Good talk.

1397
01:28:28,060 --> 01:28:35,400
carod yes my lord i met apollo grandmother uncle poseidon

1398
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:45,380

i met so many people carod okay we should get aphrodite he

1399
01:28:45,380 --> 01:28:52,320
can afford that you and your perennie demeter you must have
so much catching up to do perhaps you even have the power to

1400
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:58,960
unfreeze that disapproving scowl i oft fear is permanently
set so I mean, she's happy when she sees me.

1401
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:00,940
Maybe she likes me more than you.

1402
01:29:02,740 --> 01:29:03,600
Oh, shit.

1403
01:29:05,460 --> 01:29:08,620
Oh, I got the double.

1404
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:12,820
I got a duo.

1405
01:29:15,820 --> 01:29:16,340
Yeah.

1406
01:29:18,220 --> 01:29:20,620
You deal more damage with your weapon, the more...

1407
01:29:20,620 --> 01:29:22,260
Oh, wait, you should get that.

1408
01:29:22,980 --> 01:29:23,300
Right?

1409
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:24,320
That's the duo.

1410
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:28,440
Do it this early?

1411
01:29:28,900 --> 01:29:30,180
The first time?

1412
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:34,240
You guys watch my older Hades streams.

1413
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:36,940
I think the very first time I played it, I got a legendary.

1414
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:41,920
I can't look at the people who are so bad.

1415
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:44,500
What?

1416
01:29:44,620 --> 01:29:45,620
First time, guys?

1417
01:29:47,620 --> 01:29:49,440
Our luck is bullshit.

1418
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:51,240
Why do we have another test?

1419
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:52,020
Just let me through.

1420
01:29:52,260 --> 01:29:54,300
You surpassed me before, yet I...

1421
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:55,120
I wonder.

1422
01:29:55,540 --> 01:29:57,060
This streamer ass luck.

1423
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:03,000
Or did the fates themselves perhaps provide a little nudge?

1424
01:30:05,300 --> 01:30:06,160
Come head mistress.

1425
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:10,680
If I could be provoked that easily, I'd stand just like our
creators.

1426
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:19,500
Good fortune seldom comes to those in no position to- Yeah,
my luck balances.

1427
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:20,460
You're right, my luck balance.

1428
01:30:20,860 --> 01:30:23,740
I have shitty real life luck, but good streamer luck.

1429
01:30:24,820 --> 01:30:27,380
My health is fucked, but that's okay, guys.

1430
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:29,320
Look at this cool-ass build I got.

1431
01:30:30,380 --> 01:30:33,420
Look at this cool thing I got in game, though.

1432
01:30:34,180 --> 01:30:34,660
Shit.

1433
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:36,500
Sorry, I got too cocky.

1434
01:30:49,850 --> 01:30:50,550
Oh, my God.

1435
01:30:50,670 --> 01:30:51,050
This is bad.

1436
01:30:51,270 --> 01:30:52,350
I'm not doing so well.

1437
01:30:57,100 --> 01:30:57,800
It's okay.

1438
01:30:58,180 --> 01:30:59,960
It's not okay, but it's okay.

1439
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:01,200
I like to cope.

1440
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:03,060
Coping is fine.

1441
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:07,400
Oh, no, not.

1442
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:10,700
Bro, not fucking Toho, bro.

1443
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:13,520
Bro, come on, come on!

1444
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:17,300
Toho's not cool!

1445
01:31:17,860 --> 01:31:18,600
Mistress, please!

1446
01:31:26,250 --> 01:31:26,990
Oh god.

1447
01:31:28,190 --> 01:31:29,830
Oh fuck, I hate this one!

1448
01:31:30,470 --> 01:31:31,750
Alright, sister!

1449
01:31:32,410 --> 01:31:32,750
Ah!

1450
01:31:34,090 --> 01:31:35,210
This is not fair.

1451
01:31:35,690 --> 01:31:36,390
This is not fair!

1452
01:31:36,590 --> 01:31:36,990
It's not fair!

1453
01:31:37,130 --> 01:31:37,570
It's not fair!

1454
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:43,540
Oh god.

1455
01:31:44,020 --> 01:31:44,460
Oh god.

1456
01:31:44,860 --> 01:31:46,700

because you're the one boss that technically like I don't

1460
01:32:34,990 --> 01:32:46,070
technically I don't have to fight I passed the test yeah you
know like technically we don't have to fight.

1461
01:32:47,510 --> 01:32:50,630
Ruki has to hug every part of her life's stomach.

1462
01:32:51,230 --> 01:32:51,230
Gotcha.

1463
01:32:51,590 --> 01:32:52,150
True.

1464
01:32:53,890 --> 01:32:54,170
Oh, shit.

1465
01:32:54,390 --> 01:32:55,770
It's the clock guy.

1466
01:32:56,870 --> 01:32:57,390
It's Kronos.

1467
01:32:57,770 --> 01:33:00,410
What compelled you to wander in and out of Herobus?

1468
01:33:02,510 --> 01:33:03,830
I'm not your girl, old man.

1469
01:33:04,390 --> 01:33:05,070
That's right.

1470
01:33:05,230 --> 01:33:05,870
That's creepy.

1471
01:33:07,670 --> 01:33:12,070
So it seems you appear to be quite pressed for time.

1472
01:33:12,850 --> 01:33:22,470

I'll find a way.

1479
01:33:54,310 --> 01:33:54,890
All right.

1480
01:33:55,090 --> 01:33:56,030
Down we go.

That's a lot.

It's these guys.

01:34:07,190 --> 01:34:08,450
I hate these guys so much.

1490
01:34:09,990 --> 01:34:11,850
I think the exploding guy is the worst one.

1491
01:34:13,330 --> 01:34:13,350
Yeah.

1492
01:34:13,590 --> 01:34:14,330
I guess we'll get out.

1493
01:34:16,690 --> 01:34:21,870
Oh My god a fucking course.

I'm not okay.

1498
01:34:28,230 --> 01:34:29,490
We're not doing okay right now.

1499
01:34:29,650 --> 01:34:31,850
There's too many too many fires

1500

Wait, what?

What's this?

1507
01:34:52,690 --> 01:34:52,910
Lore?

1508
01:34:54,790 --> 01:34:55,870
Is Lore worth it?

1509
01:34:57,250 --> 01:34:58,310
Is Savory Mooncake exist?

1510
01:34:58,470 --> 01:34:59,730
Because if not, I'm going to invent him.

1511
01:34:59,890 --> 01:35:01,210
Also, the sheep can punch enemies.

1512
01:35:01,330 --> 01:35:02,910
Thanks for continuing to be amazing.

1513
01:35:03,090 --> 01:35:03,830
Oh, it can.

1514
01:35:04,270 --> 01:35:05,130
Hands are good.

1515
01:35:05,350 --> 01:35:05,810
Free stuff.

1516
01:35:05,910 --> 01:35:06,950
Oh, I like free stuff.

1517
01:35:07,890 --> 01:35:09,010
Skull, thank you for the super chat.

Thank you.

1520
01:35:09,930 --> 01:35:11,390
I mean, I won't be surprised.

1521
01:35:12,450 --> 01:35:13,310
Hey, flower.

1522
01:35:14,350 --> 01:35:15,710
Are you okay?

1523
01:35:16,310 --> 01:35:19,660
Oh my god, it's so painful to be so this beautiful, isn't
it?

1524
01:35:20,770 --> 01:35:22,470
I fucking do it!

1525
01:35:22,690 --> 01:35:25,230
Far and wide, just to gaze upon me.

1526
01:35:25,570 --> 01:35:26,410
Not that I blame you.

1527
01:35:26,770 --> 01:35:27,810
And get totally rejected.

1528
01:35:28,450 --> 01:35:30,430
I fucking knew it the way he was posed.

1529
01:35:31,410 --> 01:35:31,870
God!

1530
01:35:32,210 --> 01:35:36,010
It's so painful to be this handsome, I know.

1531
01:35:36,590 --> 01:35:37,890
Oh my god.

1532
01:35:41,070 --> 01:35:42,950
His name is Narcissus?

1533
01:35:43,130 --> 01:35:44,150
Oh, that's good.

1534
01:35:44,350 --> 01:35:45,950
I don't even know who you are.

1535
01:35:49,690 --> 01:35:51,010
I'm a narcissist, dummy.

1536
01:35:51,530 --> 01:35:52,250
The narcissist.

1537
01:35:53,210 --> 01:35:57,870
And if your note would be sooner, then why don't you relieve
me of one of these innumerable gifts the others offered in

1538
01:35:57,870 --> 01:35:58,210
vain?

1539
01:35:58,490 --> 01:35:59,970
It's Nicholas Kane.

1540
01:36:02,830 --> 01:36:04,370
Received a gift and...

1541
01:36:04,370 --> 01:36:04,790
Oh, wait.

1542
01:36:04,890 --> 01:36:06,770
Oh, he gives me free stuff.

1543
01:36:08,190 --> 01:36:09,150
I know.

1544
01:36:09,550 --> 01:36:10,210
My God.

1545
01:36:11,450 --> 01:36:15,890
I know what a horrible life you have to live to be just so
beautiful.

1546
01:36:18,510 --> 01:36:24,910

1551
01:36:54,090 --> 01:36:56,390
I saw him just in time before he did anything.

1552
01:36:56,990 --> 01:36:58,110
Did anything dumb!

1553
01:37:00,650 --> 01:37:02,870
Jesus Christ, that was a lot of fish.

1554
01:37:04,170 --> 01:37:04,990

1555
01:37:06,010 --> 01:37:07,150
Fine, I can freeze him.

1556
01:37:07,850 --> 01:37:09,510
I feel like I didn't get a lot of doubles yet.

1557
01:37:10,910 --> 01:37:12,250
Uh, one, two, or three, chat.

1558
01:37:14,950 --> 01:37:18,030
His name is literally where the word narcissist comes from.

1559
01:37:18,050 --> 01:37:18,730
Why, though?

1560
01:37:18,850 --> 01:37:19,590
I don't understand.

1561
01:37:20,030 --> 01:37:23,470

1648
01:44:10,930 --> 01:44:11,110

1651
01:44:20,500 --> 01:44:21,640
Okay, that's fine.

1652
01:44:23,860 --> 01:44:24,200

1653
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:28,360
You can't keep time.

01:44:28,740 --> 01:44:29,520
That's right.

1655
01:44:30,380 --> 01:44:31,900
You're a little bit pitchy there.

1656
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:34,680
That's so cute.

1657
01:44:35,860 --> 01:44:36,920
Let's go.

1658
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:39,420

01:44:39,580 --> 01:44:40,720
Yoink, my pearl now.

1660
01:44:41,260 --> 01:44:41,900
Let's go down.

1661
01:44:42,840 --> 01:44:45,580
You ruined the side, Stokey.

1662
01:44:45,960 --> 01:44:47,540
The anti's won.

1663
01:44:49,300 --> 01:44:50,540
Okay, we gotta heal.

1664
01:44:51,660 --> 01:44:52,380
Go ahead, go here.

1665
01:44:52,780 --> 01:44:53,120
No.

1666
01:44:53,680 --> 01:44:55,180
Okay, that looked like a door, okay?

1667
01:44:56,260 --> 01:44:59,420
Within a green-tinged chamber that the shrewd...

1668
01:44:59,420 --> 01:45:00,340
What a hater.

1669
01:45:02,340 --> 01:45:03,900
He passes to Mr. Narcissus.

1670
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:07,400
The pain of being so beautiful must be such a burden to him.

1671
01:45:09,480 --> 01:45:10,000
But...

1672
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:10,380
Nice.

1673
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:13,940
Oh, it's like a little behind the scenes.

1674
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:15,960
Damn.

1675
01:45:16,140 --> 01:45:16,860
What the fuck?

1676
01:45:17,120 --> 01:45:17,380
This is...

1677
01:45:17,380 --> 01:45:18,160
Oh, this is...

1678
01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:29,980

1680
01:45:45,060 --> 01:45:50,220
long way from the crossroads so this is where the real
action is huh Easeless.

1681
01:45:53,460 --> 01:45:54,320
Practicing for what?

1682
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:55,560
It just took a turn, Aris.

1683
01:45:55,960 --> 01:45:56,700
You know how it goes.

1684
01:45:57,520 --> 01:46:00,700
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some urgent business to
attend to.

1685
01:46:02,300 --> 01:46:03,380
Always in such a rush.

1686
01:46:03,740 --> 01:46:05,040
I'd really hate to slow you down.

1687
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:06,820
Though, let's hang out some time, okay?

1688
01:46:06,980 --> 01:46:07,920
Yeah, she has a gun.

1689
01:46:08,820 --> 01:46:09,780
What the fuck?

1690
01:46:10,920 --> 01:46:12,120
I have guns back then?

1691
01:46:12,280 --> 01:46:13,600
Bro, is she from the future?

1692
01:46:14,480 --> 01:46:14,880
What?

1693
01:46:16,440 --> 01:46:17,440
Oh, I got blessed.

1694
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:19,360
Yeah, what did she do to me?

1695
01:46:20,360 --> 01:46:23,200
Guys, I don't think being blessed by her was a good thing.

1696
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:25,060
What else is over here?

1697
01:46:26,840 --> 01:46:27,520
Knock, knock.

1698
01:46:28,520 --> 01:46:29,980
I'm just gonna walk around a little bit.

1699
01:46:30,740 --> 01:46:31,680
It's such a big area.

1700
01:46:37,020 --> 01:46:37,620
The seed.

1701
01:46:38,060 --> 01:46:38,800
Oh, that's two.

1702
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:41,920
Oh, this is new.

1703
01:46:42,680 --> 01:46:43,480
What is that?

1704
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:45,580
Unseal?

1705
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:49,840
Is it?

1706
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:52,640
Wait, I want to see you.

1707
01:46:52,660 --> 01:46:54,080
want to steal this.

1708
01:46:56,940 --> 01:46:57,840
That's fine.

1709
01:47:01,880 --> 01:47:06,800
I feel like the seal... Okay, the casting is so good,
though, in general.

1710
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:08,940
The freeze casting?

1711
01:47:11,580 --> 01:47:12,140
Okay.

1712
01:47:12,820 --> 01:47:14,300
As long as I'm over here, it's fine.

1713
01:47:18,160 --> 01:47:18,780
That's right.

1714
01:47:18,940 --> 01:47:19,740
Can't get me!

1715
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:21,280
Get frozen, bitch!

1716
01:47:23,640 --> 01:47:24,200
Okay.

1717
01:47:24,220 --> 01:47:24,780
That's right.

1718
01:47:26,020 --> 01:47:27,640
Can't even touch me.

1719
01:47:29,960 --> 01:47:31,140
Your attacks hit two times.

1720
01:47:31,300 --> 01:47:32,000
Your attacks are...

1721
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,280
Oh, 5.50% faster.

1722
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:38,580
Press and hold Q.

1723
01:47:39,480 --> 01:47:40,500
Oh, wait.

1724
01:47:41,180 --> 01:47:42,040
Two or three?

1725
01:47:43,020 --> 01:47:43,360
Two.

1726
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:45,240
Two for the freeze, I feel like.

1727
01:47:45,740 --> 01:47:47,200
Because of my freeze?

1728
01:47:49,740 --> 01:47:51,760
That means the freeze will last even longer.

1729
01:47:52,440 --> 01:47:53,860
Just because of how fast it is.

1730
01:47:54,900 --> 01:47:56,020
Oh my god, there's more?

1731
01:47:57,560 --> 01:47:58,640
What the fuck?

1732
01:47:59,980 --> 01:48:01,100
Wait, that's so broken.

1733
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:04,560
Oh my god, not again.

1734
01:48:05,660 --> 01:48:06,520
Oh my god.

1735
01:48:06,660 --> 01:48:07,800
Oh god, not the darkness.

1736
01:48:11,300 --> 01:48:11,880
Okay, it's fine.

1737
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:12,840
I have the mega freeze.

1738
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:15,280
Yeah, okay, that is so strong.

1739
01:48:15,420 --> 01:48:17,180
Wait, my freeze build is actually so strong.

1740
01:48:18,780 --> 01:48:24,200
I think the freeze build is good for minions, but for bosses
is not like the best.

1741
01:48:26,360 --> 01:48:37,080
wait eras blessings based on devs telling you you're doing
too well on these not in real life what do you mean devs

1743
01:48:54,210 --> 01:49:00,710

did.

1744
01:49:02,030 --> 01:49:02,750
What?

1745
01:49:03,190 --> 01:49:04,590
How do I check it?

1746
01:49:07,250 --> 01:49:07,970
Boons?

1747
01:49:08,130 --> 01:49:09,290
I don't check boons.

1748
01:49:10,230 --> 01:49:11,350
What item is that?

1749
01:49:11,770 --> 01:49:13,250
What do I press?

1750
01:49:14,290 --> 01:49:14,790
B.

1751
01:49:15,090 --> 01:49:16,070
What did he do?

1752
01:49:18,350 --> 01:49:19,850
Oh my god.

1753
01:49:21,270 --> 01:49:23,330
Um, this grows each encounter?

1754
01:49:24,510 --> 01:49:24,770
What?

1755
01:49:30,780 --> 01:49:31,940
Bro, we're fucked.

1756
01:49:35,820 --> 01:49:38,420
I need to grab to shit and blow my nose up in a rack.

1757
01:49:39,480 --> 01:49:40,120
The fact

1758
01:49:56,850 --> 01:49:57,970
that it grows.

1759
01:49:58,350 --> 01:49:59,830
Like, what do you mean?

1760
01:50:00,010 --> 01:50:04,550
Oh, just because I beat the second boss on my third attempt,
they're like, no.

1761
01:50:05,050 --> 01:50:07,510
No, I'm just playing the game how it is, devs.

1762
01:50:07,750 --> 01:50:08,850
That is so bullshit.

1763
01:50:09,270 --> 01:50:11,670
Oh, just because I'm good at gaming, I get punished.

1764
01:50:12,230 --> 01:50:12,710
I...

1765
01:50:16,050 --> 01:50:17,110
Oh, my God.

1766
01:50:17,430 --> 01:50:20,630
Just like Narcissus, it's so hard to be such a good gamer.

1767
01:50:21,490 --> 01:50:25,530
Guys, guys, it's such a prudent to be such an insane gamer.

1768
01:50:35,100 --> 01:50:36,720
You have to be...

1769
01:50:36,720 --> 01:50:38,740
Bro, it's my second encounter!

1770
01:50:40,580 --> 01:50:43,100
Okay, woe is me.

1771
01:50:45,480 --> 01:50:48,680
Okay, do you get to meet her or are heathen?

1772
01:50:50,240 --> 01:50:52,260
I mean, let me stop.

1773
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:54,120
Bro, this run was so good!

1774
01:50:54,280 --> 01:50:56,760
I had such good abilities, too.

1775
01:50:58,060 --> 01:50:58,900
Oh, my God.

1776
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:00,680
This was actually a really good run.

1777
01:51:01,400 --> 01:51:01,760
Fire?

1778
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:03,300
Alright, fire.

1779
01:51:04,440 --> 01:51:06,540
It doesn't matter which way I'll go.

1780
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,180
Bro, and when she...

1781
01:51:11,180 --> 01:51:12,320
Oh, my God!

1782
01:51:14,600 --> 01:51:16,260
Oh, my God.

1783
01:51:17,260 --> 01:51:18,720
Oh, my God.

1784
01:51:20,860 --> 01:51:23,240
Bro, she does so much.

1785
01:51:25,100 --> 01:51:25,380
Okay.

1786
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:28,880
Guys, I had a lot of HP just then.

1787
01:51:30,260 --> 01:51:32,120
The keyword was I had.

1788
01:51:40,900 --> 01:51:41,660
Really?

1789
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:44,160
What the fuck hit me?

1790
01:51:44,220 --> 01:51:44,880
The thorns?

1791
01:51:45,900 --> 01:51:46,260
Okay.

1792
01:51:46,780 --> 01:51:48,480

1793
01:51:49,820 --> 01:51:51,280

01:52:27,300 --> 01:52:27,980
Okay, let's pick up this.

1800
01:52:28,620 --> 01:52:29,500
It's getting...

1801
01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:31,320
Doki, it's much worse than you can go over 100.

1802
01:52:31,620 --> 01:52:32,920
Oh, that's good to know!

1803
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:34,200
That's...

1804
01:52:35,180 --> 01:52:36,200
Oh, wow!

1805
01:52:36,720 --> 01:52:37,440
Thank God!

1806
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:39,940
Thank God it can go over 100, guys.

1807
01:52:40,920 --> 01:52:42,240
Thank fucking God.

1808
01:52:44,120 --> 01:52:46,020
A path of golden petals shall...

1809
01:52:46,020 --> 01:52:48,060
Oh my God, at least we get an another.

1810
01:52:50,260 --> 01:52:51,760
Like, it just kills me.

1811
01:52:51,780 --> 01:52:53,080
Like, I die and I still die.

1812
01:52:54,460 --> 01:52:56,760
My next run takes damage from it.

1813
01:52:56,820 --> 01:52:59,120
That's how strong it is.

1814
01:53:03,060 --> 01:53:07,360
Like, at this point, my next run will take damage from her
goddamn curse.

1815
01:53:12,580 --> 01:53:13,360
Oh, wait.

1816
01:53:13,580 --> 01:53:14,300
Another one.

1817
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:15,780
No, no, I got the other one.

1818
01:53:16,900 --> 01:53:17,400
No, I did.

1819
01:53:17,440 --> 01:53:18,060
I got it.

1820
01:53:19,160 --> 01:53:20,880
Wait, it doubled again?

1821
01:53:22,360 --> 01:53:23,200
Where is it?

1822
01:53:23,220 --> 01:53:23,960
Oh, my God.

1823
01:53:24,160 --> 01:53:25,540
Wait, no, that's a different one.

1824
01:53:30,760 --> 01:53:31,560
I'm lost.

1825
01:53:31,700 --> 01:53:32,960
I don't even know where I went.

1826
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:38,520
Oh, it doubled the mana.

1827
01:53:38,680 --> 01:53:39,180
Oh, okay.

1828
01:53:40,340 --> 01:53:40,740
Nice.

1829
01:53:42,860 --> 01:53:44,800
Okay, I just want to go around it first.

1830
01:53:45,920 --> 01:53:49,840
Just want to make sure I got everything I need before I do
the goddamn...

1831
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:58,200
There's so many things here.

1832
01:53:58,660 --> 01:54:00,840
I just want to make sure I get everything I need to get.

1833
01:54:01,140 --> 01:54:02,060
Alright, there's the coins.

1834
01:54:02,600 --> 01:54:04,100
Alright, we'll get out the heart first.

1835
01:54:04,840 --> 01:54:05,280
The tree?

1836
01:54:05,540 --> 01:54:06,040
Which tree?

1837
01:54:08,700 --> 01:54:10,760
Oh my god, I need to make sure I don't get into the thorns.

1838
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,020
I'll grab all the free stuff first.

1839
01:54:16,160 --> 01:54:16,860
The gold tree?

1840
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:17,980
There was a gold tree.

1841
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:18,980
Oh, there it is.

1842
01:54:20,240 --> 01:54:22,040
I should try an incantation back home.

1843
01:54:22,320 --> 01:54:23,880
I need to do an incantation, guys.

1844
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:24,820

1851
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:34,820
Do I have to get the money one or can I just leave?

1852
01:55:35,020 --> 01:55:36,320
I technically don't need the money.

1853
01:55:38,540 --> 01:55:41,500
Okay, at least the forest doesn't do like 80 damage to me.

1854
01:55:46,650 --> 01:55:47,490
You have to?

1855
01:55:47,590 --> 01:55:48,670
Okay, god damn it.

1856
01:55:48,730 --> 01:55:52,810
I don't want to take the money just because it's just too
much of a tomb risky.

1857
01:55:55,010 --> 01:55:56,330
There's more to find here still.

1858
01:55:56,830 --> 01:55:57,770
God damn it.

1859
01:55:58,390 --> 01:55:59,350
Where is it?

1860
01:55:59,590 --> 01:56:00,330
Oh, it's over here.

1861
01:56:00,970 --> 01:56:01,510
Ah!

1862
01:56:01,810 --> 01:56:02,110
God!

1863
01:56:04,570 --> 01:56:07,690
I keep accidentally walking into the thorns.

1864
01:56:12,410 --> 01:56:14,170
Okay, it was an accident.

1865
01:56:14,950 --> 01:56:18,550
Oh, I did not see them.

1866
01:56:20,330 --> 01:56:22,090
I'll put this out just in case.

1867
01:56:25,930 --> 01:56:26,610
Alright, nice.

1868
01:56:26,990 --> 01:56:28,970
As long as there's no Medusa's, we should be fine.

1869
01:56:31,670 --> 01:56:32,070
Nice.

1870
01:56:32,430 --> 01:56:33,510
Oh my god, these guys are easier.

1871
01:56:33,970 --> 01:56:35,150
I guess it's because it's for money.

1872
01:56:35,850 --> 01:56:36,410
And another!

1873
01:56:37,650 --> 01:56:38,450
Gamba-gamba!

1874
01:56:38,810 --> 01:56:40,490

going to be alive for much longer in this, in this area.

2049
02:08:10,840 --> 02:08:11,960
Central control.

2050
02:08:12,600 --> 02:08:14,620
It's only 60% Doki.

2051
02:08:20,450 --> 02:08:20,750
Okay.

2052
02:08:21,050 --> 02:08:23,870
You are trespassing on private property.

2053
02:08:24,410 --> 02:08:25,030
Oh no.

2054
02:08:25,890 --> 02:08:28,170

Coronas?

02:08:29,390 --> 02:08:30,530
Fucking old man.

2057
02:08:32,830 --> 02:08:34,250
Oh, it's like a clock ticking.

2058
02:08:34,490 --> 02:08:36,210
Kobo, thank you for the 20 gift of chips.

2059
02:08:36,450 --> 02:08:37,390
Thank you, thank you.

2060
02:08:38,470 --> 02:08:39,250

2061
02:08:39,970 --> 02:08:41,790
Damn right I'm trespassing.

2062
02:08:42,230 --> 02:08:43,750
Gotta do shit about it.

2063
02:08:44,410 --> 02:08:47,250
Oh my god, it's 14%.

2064
02:08:47,250 --> 02:08:49,530
That means it would have been a...

2065
02:08:49,530 --> 02:08:50,430
Oh my god.

2066
02:08:51,130 --> 02:08:53,990
That's what 60% damage upgrades, too.

2067
02:08:55,270 --> 02:08:55,630
That's right.

2068
02:08:55,710 --> 02:08:56,610
Yoink, my pet.

2069
02:09:00,790 --> 02:09:02,570

02:09:03,990 --> 02:09:04,550
Oh, God.

2071
02:09:06,130 --> 02:09:07,770
I'm just going to put this out just in case.

2072
02:09:08,350 --> 02:09:10,190
Because I don't trust myself to live.

2073
02:09:11,430 --> 02:09:12,270
Wait, what?

2074
02:09:12,650 --> 02:09:14,370

Okay, thank God.

2085
02:10:02,670 --> 02:10:05,030
The freeze is actually clutching right now.

2086
02:10:06,170 --> 02:10:06,670
Holy shit.

2087
02:10:07,530 --> 02:10:08,570
Like they can't even get me.

2088
02:10:08,610 --> 02:10:09,870
Okay, we gotta get freeze again.

2089
02:10:10,370 --> 02:10:11,430
It's actually so strong.

2090
02:10:13,930 --> 02:10:16,410
No traitor to the house shall go unpunished.

2091
02:10:17,610 --> 02:10:17,990
Oh.

2092
02:10:19,110 --> 02:10:20,430

Can I get some three boons, guys?

2095
02:10:27,230 --> 02:10:28,970
Yeah, freeze as such is so clutch.

2096
02:10:32,290 --> 02:10:33,530
I break this before it kills me.

2097
02:10:33,930 --> 02:10:37,650
Well, I guess everything kills me first.

2098
02:10:40,250 --> 02:10:42,650
Okay, grab these guys first.

2099
02:10:44,750 --> 02:10:46,910

2135
02:14:49,070 --> 02:14:50,610
I'm, I can technically afford this.

2136
02:14:52,810 --> 02:14:53,790
Wait, I can salute her?

2137
02:14:55,390 --> 02:14:56,010
Salute.

2138
02:14:56,210 --> 02:14:57,170
We moonlight guide you.

2139
02:14:58,510 --> 02:15:01,430
Oh my god, I don't think food's gonna help.

2140
02:15:02,090 --> 02:15:03,810
I don't think it's gonna.

2141
02:15:03,970 --> 02:15:04,950
Don't buy the anvil.

2142
02:15:06,250 --> 02:15:08,560
Guys, food is not gonna save me.

2143
02:15:10,810 --> 02:15:11,930
I think I can.

2144
02:15:14,750 --> 02:15:17,690
Food is not gonna salvage this run.

2145
02:15:21,230 --> 02:15:22,510
Why no anvil?

2146
02:15:22,630 --> 02:15:23,710
What does the anvil do?

2147
02:15:25,330 --> 02:15:28,270
You'll take two hits instead of one.

2148
02:15:34,300 --> 02:15:35,640
Guys, I feel like I ticked the...

2149
02:15:35,640 --> 02:15:37,140
It's still gonna be one hit.

2150
02:15:39,960 --> 02:15:41,200
Oh, swaps upgrades.

2151
02:15:41,260 --> 02:15:42,280
Yeah, we don't need a swap upgrade.

2152
02:15:43,500 --> 02:15:44,380
Let's just grab this.

2153
02:15:49,320 --> 02:15:52,020
Your caskings power and knocks the foe away.

2154
02:15:52,220 --> 02:15:54,540
Your special hits foes will splash.

2155
02:15:54,600 --> 02:15:55,900
I never used right click, though.

2156
02:15:55,960 --> 02:15:56,640
That's the thing.

2157
02:15:57,120 --> 02:15:58,540
Which would be good against boss.

2158
02:15:58,820 --> 02:15:59,300
Flourish?

2159
02:16:00,800 --> 02:16:01,240
Two?

2160
02:16:02,460 --> 02:16:03,340
All right.

2161
02:16:04,720 --> 02:16:05,920
I'll grab this one too.

2162
02:16:08,400 --> 02:16:09,180
Oh, shit.

2163
02:16:10,500 --> 02:16:11,660
Might as well get one, right?

2164
02:16:16,480 --> 02:16:18,120
I mean, let's do...

2165
02:16:18,860 --> 02:16:20,160
I mean, it's rare, epic.

2166
02:16:20,880 --> 02:16:21,360
One is...

2167
02:16:21,360 --> 02:16:22,720
It's epic, so might as well.

2168
02:16:22,840 --> 02:16:24,360
I'd be surprised if we...

2169
02:16:24,360 --> 02:16:25,780
I'm going to be so surprised.

2170
02:16:26,040 --> 02:16:28,380
The House of Hades now has but a fading memory.

2171
02:16:28,940 --> 02:16:32,080
For in its place, a new-formed palace rises.

2172
02:16:33,120 --> 02:16:43,160
the final area technically i like made it to the final world
or is there more levels after this i'm not beating chronos i

02:17:33,140 --> 02:17:33,640
Hello!

2178
02:17:34,400 --> 02:17:38,240
A guest arrived so soon.

2179
02:17:39,240 --> 02:17:41,260
It is not often that I entertain of late.

2180
02:17:42,220 --> 02:17:44,560
Perhaps after this house becomes a little more presentable.

2181
02:17:45,280 --> 02:17:47,340
Though for the moment, you must pardon the ghost.

2182
02:17:47,380 --> 02:17:48,260
Oh, it's just sad.

2183
02:17:48,620 --> 02:17:49,160
Oh, gross.

2184
02:17:50,320 --> 02:17:51,100
That's actually worse.

2185
02:17:51,300 --> 02:17:54,080
I wish... Sad is actually worse, to be fair.

2186
02:17:54,260 --> 02:17:56,740
You can't... It's hard to get sad off of anything.

2187
02:17:57,620 --> 02:17:59,020
You know who I am.

2188
02:17:59,280 --> 02:18:00,600
And you know why I'm here.

2189
02:18:01,980 --> 02:18:02,760
Come now.

2190
02:18:03,120 --> 02:18:12,040

way and i have so many questions how have you been and how

2194
02:18:33,200 --> 02:18:35,200
Cursing is forbidden in this house.

2195
02:18:36,060 --> 02:18:39,140
By that token, fighting is forbidden as well.

2196
02:18:40,280 --> 02:18:44,200
But for you, my girl, we shall have to make an exception.

2197
02:18:45,540 --> 02:18:47,120
Time for you to go.

2198
02:18:47,360 --> 02:18:48,320
God, I'm scared.

2199
02:18:48,900 --> 02:18:50,800
I don't know what she does.

2200
02:18:52,740 --> 02:18:53,520
Oh, fuck.

2201
02:18:53,860 --> 02:18:54,600
Oh, shit.

2202
02:18:55,580 --> 02:18:57,180
Bro, that is not fair.

2203
02:18:58,900 --> 02:19:00,140
That is not fair.

2204
02:19:00,240 --> 02:19:01,380
You have minions.

2205
02:19:04,260 --> 02:19:05,020
Oh, God.

2206
02:19:05,420 --> 02:19:05,680
Oh, God.

2207
02:19:08,040 --> 02:19:09,580
Oh, this is not fair at all.

2208
02:19:10,180 --> 02:19:11,080
This is not fair.

2209
02:19:15,970 --> 02:19:16,630
Oh, God.

2210
02:19:19,070 --> 02:19:20,130
Oh, my God.

2211
02:19:21,090 --> 02:19:21,870
I'm so scared.

2212
02:19:28,800 --> 02:19:29,920
Oh, God.

2213
02:19:30,580 --> 02:19:36,420
I don't know what she does.

2214
02:19:37,380 --> 02:19:38,080
Or he, sorry.

2215
02:19:40,040 --> 02:19:41,780
Like, what does he do?

2216
02:19:44,800 --> 02:19:47,700
Oh no Are

This is so bullshit 100% damage Oh, yeah, that's bad.

2220
02:20:20,740 --> 02:20:24,600
At least the food gave me three hits three hits.

2221
02:20:24,820 --> 02:20:29,820
It's fine Thanks, there is I thought we were on the same
side.

2222
02:20:30,020 --> 02:20:31,980
Do you not want to save the world?

2223
02:20:33,280 --> 02:20:36,420
Red you're not hence I go over this flashback

2224
02:20:47,450 --> 02:20:53,190
I bid you farewell for now Lord hypnos by hypnos Oh, that's
cute.

2225
02:20:53,290 --> 02:21:00,070

that her foe she has just chaos right?

haggardy about just a tiny little girl goddess though i'd

2229

expect that pointy hat of hers to give her away I'll look
for it.

2230
02:21:47,290 --> 02:21:47,570
Thank you.

2231
02:21:47,630 --> 02:21:54,510
That's why no one loves her because she's a fucking bitch If
she's not a bitch, maybe people will actually like her Oh

2232
02:21:54,510 --> 02:21:54,750
heckity.

2233
02:21:54,830 --> 02:22:07,690
I found her Got me you did millennia way, but I dare say I
can escape your clutches yet I did I'm so good at how to

2234
02:22:07,690 --> 02:22:12,030
seek guys Yeah, wait, she disappeared again.

2235
02:22:13,110 --> 02:22:16,270
Oh Where is Hegety about?

2236
02:22:16,790 --> 02:22:17,830
Yeah, where is Hegety?

2237
02:22:19,790 --> 02:22:21,310
Where do I go now?

2238
02:22:25,240 --> 02:22:26,860
Where does she disappear to?

2239
02:22:27,620 --> 02:22:28,260
Oh, there she is.

2240
02:22:28,420 --> 02:22:28,940
I found her.

2241
02:22:29,060 --> 02:22:29,900
God, I'm so good.

2242
02:22:30,020 --> 02:22:30,240
You are.

2243
02:22:30,780 --> 02:22:31,320
Got you again.

2244
02:22:33,100 --> 02:22:34,880
Ah, so persistent.

2245
02:22:36,160 --> 02:22:37,620
Give up already, witch.

2246
02:22:38,200 --> 02:22:40,060
For I'm a Titaness.

2247
02:22:40,460 --> 02:22:42,260
You cannot vanquish me.

2248
02:22:42,260 --> 02:22:42,620
No!

2249
02:22:43,700 --> 02:22:45,040
I will kill you.

2250
02:22:46,480 --> 02:22:47,160
That's right.

2251
02:22:47,640 --> 02:22:49,880
So I need to double check my sound real quick.

2252
02:22:50,780 --> 02:22:53,960
Because every time I unmute myself, it, like, goes lower.

2253
02:22:54,080 --> 02:22:54,600
So I want to be sure.

2254
02:22:54,620 --> 02:22:54,920
Oh, there.

2255
02:22:55,020 --> 02:22:55,620
I knew it.

2256
02:22:56,100 --> 02:22:56,700
Alright, there you go.

2257
02:22:58,580 --> 02:22:59,160
Oh, I heard her.

2258
02:22:59,240 --> 02:22:59,980
She's on my right.

2259
02:23:02,400 --> 02:23:03,580
Oh, there you are.

2260
02:23:03,820 --> 02:23:05,980
Okay, like, even if you can't see her, okay.

2261
02:23:06,380 --> 02:23:11,960
Her strategy for hide and seek is, like, if I can't see
anything, no one can find me.

2262
02:23:12,440 --> 02:23:12,880
Like, yeah.

2263
02:23:16,160 --> 02:23:18,160
I've not heard your laughter before.

2264
02:23:19,560 --> 02:23:20,440
Reminded me of your mother.

2265
02:23:21,500 --> 02:23:23,800
A much preferable sound to that of grief.

2266
02:23:26,040 --> 02:23:27,300
I promise not to cry again.

2267
02:23:28,300 --> 02:23:30,040
I still get sad sometimes, but...

2268
02:23:31,340 --> 02:23:32,520
Because you're an orphan.

2269
02:23:33,800 --> 02:23:36,100
Do not make promises you cannot keep.

2270
02:23:36,940 --> 02:23:39,560
When tears well up, let them spill forth.

2271
02:23:40,320 --> 02:23:42,920
They're not so precious that they need be contained.

2272
02:23:46,240 --> 02:23:52,180
That run could have been the run if that bitch didn't
fucking curse me.

2273
02:23:52,260 --> 02:23:53,940
But you never cry, Hecatee.

2274
02:23:54,020 --> 02:23:56,300
I think I could have just been in the game in that one run.

2275
02:23:59,020 --> 02:24:01,220
That's the fucking worst part.

2276
02:24:01,400 --> 02:24:04,140
And then you could hear my mother's laugh again.

2277
02:24:07,180 --> 02:24:13,420
And I shall do everything in my power to prepare you so that
you may succeed where I failed.

2278
02:24:14,520 --> 02:24:17,360
If not for your family's sake, then for your birthright.

2279
02:24:17,520 --> 02:24:28,680
as the princess of the underworld what do you mean you
failed you tried to beat Kronos yourself he hurt you yeah

2280
02:24:28,680 --> 02:24:38,240
what did he do concern yourself with your own pain not mine
destroying Kronos shall not change the past and the pain

2281
02:24:38,240 --> 02:24:48,400

but enough of this on the morrow we shall teach you to hunt

But who do I give it to?

2293
02:26:21,860 --> 02:26:22,640
I don't give it to her.

2294
02:26:23,140 --> 02:26:24,200
I have five.

2295
02:26:24,540 --> 02:26:25,440
Fuck you, liars.

2296
02:26:25,620 --> 02:26:26,840
I have five nectars.

2297
02:26:27,100 --> 02:26:28,800
The best hunter in all the crossroads.

2298
02:26:33,380 --> 02:26:35,560
It was her blessing.

2299
02:26:38,660 --> 02:26:39,140
Yeah.

2300
02:26:41,180 --> 02:26:42,320
I have a ghost onion.

2301
02:26:43,220 --> 02:26:44,760
It's just a prank.

2302
02:26:45,500 --> 02:26:47,420
Can I only give it to Demeter when I meet her?

2303
02:26:47,440 --> 02:26:49,360
in the rounds.

2304
02:26:52,200 --> 02:26:53,700
What is that, Artemis?

2305
02:26:54,740 --> 02:26:55,600
I can only...

2306
02:26:55,600 --> 02:26:57,120
Okay, I can only meter it there.

2307
02:26:57,400 --> 02:26:58,780
Okay, oh hey, I'll give it...

2308
02:26:58,780 --> 02:27:02,000
Hey, Melinawee, I just wrapped a debrief here with Sister
Hecatee.

2309
02:27:02,660 --> 02:27:04,860
This place has changed a lot since last I checked.

2310
02:27:07,200 --> 02:27:07,940
Hi, Artemis.

2311
02:27:08,180 --> 02:27:08,440
Welcome.

2312
02:27:09,300 --> 02:27:11,520
We've had to scramble a bit to make ready for everything.

2313
02:27:11,740 --> 02:27:11,980
What?

2314
02:27:12,160 --> 02:27:13,040
Can I show you around?

2315
02:27:13,680 --> 02:27:14,120
Oh!

2316
02:27:14,240 --> 02:27:14,960
He said hi to Nemesis.

2317
02:27:16,740 --> 02:27:18,780
Oh, No, I have to go.

2318
02:27:19,320 --> 02:27:21,260
Olympus needs me back up top, at least a little while.

2319
02:27:21,440 --> 02:27:21,760
Again?

2320
02:27:22,200 --> 02:27:23,260
But he's got here.

2321
02:27:24,300 --> 02:27:30,400
Ares doesn't have a husband, but she has 13 children,
including murder, hunger, pain, discord, lies, and disaster.

2322
02:27:30,980 --> 02:27:31,580
Such a great...

2323
02:27:31,580 --> 02:27:32,080
Oh, my...

2324
02:27:32,080 --> 02:27:33,820
Why do we not stop her?

2325
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:34,940
She literally...

2326
02:27:34,940 --> 02:27:38,480
Like, why do we need any of these kids in our world?

2327
02:27:38,720 --> 02:27:42,000
Did no one try to stop her from having more kids?

2328
02:27:42,360 --> 02:27:44,760
Like, Marshall, thank you for the super chat.

2329
02:27:44,980 --> 02:27:46,820
Thank you for all these men trying to fix her.

2330
02:27:47,440 --> 02:27:48,360
what you did.

2331
02:27:48,680 --> 02:27:50,540
You gave us hunger.

2332
02:27:51,500 --> 02:27:55,240
Imagine being a husband of the kid whose kid is murder.

2333
02:27:56,440 --> 02:27:57,760
I hear you.

2334
02:27:58,340 --> 02:28:03,980
She should have been stopped after the murder child got
born.

2335
02:28:05,420 --> 02:28:06,940
Whoa, I didn't know.

2336
02:28:08,980 --> 02:28:10,560
My bad, guys.

2337
02:28:11,880 --> 02:28:12,740
Okay, we need this.

2338
02:28:13,960 --> 02:28:16,500

no this is an excellent result you are still here, having

2344
02:29:19,120 --> 02:29:23,640

can do to resist.

2345
02:29:24,940 --> 02:29:27,040
I cast my hex, please respond.

2346
02:29:27,720 --> 02:29:33,480
I definitely skipped like 20,000 Hecate's dialogue because I
went to Kronos.

2347
02:29:34,400 --> 02:29:34,620
Yes.

2348
02:29:35,320 --> 02:29:37,540
If I can reach him, I can take him.

2349
02:29:40,610 --> 02:29:41,290
Take him.

2350
02:29:42,530 --> 02:29:46,470
I think she was supposed to say a lot of different things to
me before I got there.

2351

Oh, it's for the pot.

2356
02:30:24,430 --> 02:30:25,350
Is there anything I'm missing?

2357
02:30:26,630 --> 02:30:29,250
I need iron and I got everything else

2358
02:30:32,470 --> 02:30:39,910
Back in one you found him goddess your looks is it all along
with my reports Even something to remember you by I reckon

2359
02:30:39,910 --> 02:30:42,410
even if the battle didn't go your way.

2360
02:30:42,630 --> 02:30:43,810
Oh Hey, that's fine.

2361
02:30:43,890 --> 02:30:51,610
Yeah, I wonder why it didn't go my way Kronos was exactly
where we Eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it Odyssey.

2362
02:30:52,630 --> 02:30:56,310
And my ability to withstand his magic went only so far.

2363
02:30:58,570 --> 02:31:02,710
Well, fortunately for you, the old are often rather slow to
learn.

2364
02:31:03,370 --> 02:31:05,390
You run into him a few more times like that.

2365
02:31:05,630 --> 02:31:06,430
Yeah, I wonder why.

2366
02:31:08,450 --> 02:31:10,950

2367
02:31:13,510 --> 02:31:14,030

It's the very far back tooth.

2378
02:33:04,880 --> 02:33:07,600
Doki loses a tooth live on stream.

2379
02:33:08,160 --> 02:33:10,060
Whereas thank you in the super chat.

2380
02:33:10,420 --> 02:33:10,520
Thank you.

2381
02:33:10,920 --> 02:33:11,340
Thank you.

2382
02:33:11,900 --> 02:33:13,060
Oh, I have one more death defiance.

2383
02:33:13,180 --> 02:33:13,980
I should grab that.

2384
02:33:20,140 --> 02:33:21,900
No, I don't have wisdom teeth no more.

2385
02:33:25,340 --> 02:33:25,740
Okay.

2386
02:33:26,700 --> 02:33:27,820
I forgot about that.

2387
02:33:28,080 --> 02:33:28,520
I forgot like.

2388
02:33:29,480 --> 02:33:29,560
All right.

2389
02:33:29,940 --> 02:33:30,580
Oh, shit.

2390
02:33:30,760 --> 02:33:32,140
Which is the best weapon?

2391
02:33:32,760 --> 02:33:35,420
Is witches staff the best one, or is there better weapons?

2392
02:33:49,840 --> 02:33:51,660
If it's only part of tooth, it's bad.

2393
02:33:51,860 --> 02:33:54,240
If it's the whole thing, roots and all, you should be okay.

2394
02:33:54,400 --> 02:33:54,940
Just don't mind.

2395
02:33:54,980 --> 02:33:55,680
I don't know.

2396
02:33:57,500 --> 02:33:58,340
I can't tell.

2397
02:33:58,480 --> 02:33:58,920
I'm trying to...

2398
02:33:58,920 --> 02:34:01,560
I'm not touching with my tongue because I'm scared.

2399
02:34:02,720 --> 02:34:04,260
Marshall, thank you, Super Chat.

2400
02:34:04,500 --> 02:34:05,260
Thank you, thank you.

2401
02:34:07,460 --> 02:34:10,220
Always go to it, but which is the best one?

2402
02:34:12,540 --> 02:34:13,420
Umbral Flames?

2403
02:34:13,540 --> 02:34:14,340
Okay, I'll try that.

2404
02:34:15,240 --> 02:34:17,480
Ignium, the umbral flames.

2405
02:34:18,080 --> 02:34:18,320
Alright.

2406
02:34:20,800 --> 02:34:26,140
Guys, I don't like this weapon.

2407
02:34:29,020 --> 02:34:30,240
Guys I don't like this weapon.

2408
02:34:34,560 --> 02:34:36,040
Guys I don't like this weapon.

2409
02:34:44,680 --> 02:34:47,420
This is not the type of encouragement that's of benefit
right now.

2410
02:34:47,840 --> 02:34:50,200
I had Kronos cornered, but he overpowered me.

2411
02:34:50,580 --> 02:34:52,200
And now I've lost the element of surprise.

2412
02:34:52,400 --> 02:34:54,600
It does a lot of damage.

2413
02:34:55,060 --> 02:34:57,040
The projectile is so weird.

2414
02:34:57,140 --> 02:34:59,420
I hate to say this, but I'd probably hang it up if I was
you.

2415
02:34:59,820 --> 02:35:00,920
But I want a chance like that.

2416
02:35:03,660 --> 02:35:04,060
Commander.

2417
02:35:06,340 --> 02:35:07,480
All right, let's see.

2418
02:35:07,680 --> 02:35:08,700
Oh, let's check the chest.

2419
02:35:09,280 --> 02:35:10,640
I can only quit one thing, right?

2420
02:35:12,120 --> 02:35:14,660
Whenever you exit, fully restore your HP up to the chest.

2421
02:35:14,680 --> 02:35:23,480
total the onion okay i can't have more than one item okay

I just cracked the tooth.

2435
02:37:36,720 --> 02:37:37,320

02:37:42,820 --> 02:37:43,820
Okay, we'll try that.

2438
02:37:46,440 --> 02:37:48,420

2439
02:37:49,060 --> 02:37:49,600
Oh, my God.

02:38:12,400 --> 02:38:14,460
Okay, I'm gonna put this in here for now.

2448
02:38:14,640 --> 02:38:15,280
Oh my god.

2449
02:38:16,760 --> 02:38:18,860
I don't know if I like this move.

2450
02:38:19,880 --> 02:38:20,340
You know what?

2451
02:38:20,420 --> 02:38:20,880
Fuck y'all.

02:38:22,080 --> 02:38:23,000

02:38:26,620 --> 02:38:27,200
Wait, what?

Okay.

2457
02:38:37,190 --> 02:38:38,190
Wait, who's still alive?

2458
02:38:38,270 --> 02:38:39,190
Oh, I need to grab the ash.

2459
02:38:39,270 --> 02:38:40,590
Okay, I was going to say, who's still alive?

2460
02:38:40,730 --> 02:38:41,310
Oh, hammer.

2461
02:38:41,690 --> 02:38:42,250
Hammer time.

2462
02:38:42,350 --> 02:38:42,990
No, it's the meter.

2463
02:38:43,170 --> 02:38:44,010
I just noticed the meter.

2464
02:38:44,690 --> 02:38:45,970
I was just like, hammer time.

2465
02:38:49,470 --> 02:38:51,130
I went with hammer time.

2466
02:38:52,990 --> 02:39:04,610
Notice it because I was thinking about hammer time All
right, your special deal 100 plus 100 damage to armor while

2467
02:39:04,610 --> 02:39:13,710
you challenge you move 5% 20% faster I actually don't know
your challenge attack 50% faster and it uses one You need to

2468
02:39:13,710 --> 02:39:24,530
spend mana to activate a oh Two okay I should better light
my way.

2469
02:39:25,970 --> 02:39:27,550
Yeah, I need to spend my mana.

2470
02:39:28,010 --> 02:39:29,530
I need to spend like five, right?

2471
02:39:29,950 --> 02:39:31,490
I guess that's what it meant.

2472
02:39:34,290 --> 02:39:35,690
Okay, there we go.

2473
02:39:38,390 --> 02:39:38,990
Alright, nice.

2474
02:39:39,730 --> 02:39:40,530
I am melting!

2475
02:39:41,110 --> 02:39:41,430
Oh!

2476
02:39:41,790 --> 02:39:43,610
Oh my god, what the fuck?

2477
02:39:44,550 --> 02:39:46,690
Oh, so that's how you do it.

2478
02:39:46,790 --> 02:39:47,030
Okay.

2479
02:39:48,710 --> 02:39:50,290
I don't know, this is weird.

2480
02:39:51,090 --> 02:39:52,790
I don't think I like this weapon.

2481
02:39:52,990 --> 02:39:57,450
Oh, hey, I can't tour required compel follow me.

2482
02:39:57,510 --> 02:39:59,000
I don't have the tool for it

2483
02:40:02,270 --> 02:40:06,810
Oh, an M1 okay God

2484
02:40:12,290 --> 02:40:20,450
Okay, I guess I could use it for more so for range I guess
would take you all right Aphrodite So you're the star

2485
02:40:20,450 --> 02:40:25,950
student of great Hecatee a little bird He told me she'd been
training up a real prodigy.

2486
02:40:25,950 --> 02:40:30,410
Imagine my surprise when it turned out to be a missing
princess of the underworld.

2487
02:40:31,050 --> 02:40:32,550
How positively scandalous.

2488
02:40:34,590 --> 02:40:35,090
Oh, it's not.

2489
02:40:35,430 --> 02:40:35,430
Okay.

2490
02:40:36,450 --> 02:40:38,290
Attack steal more damage to nearby foes.

2491
02:40:38,410 --> 02:40:45,230
You cast inflicts weak and damage falls while dragon and
rushing damages surviving rounding foes inflict weak and

2492
02:40:45,230 --> 02:40:46,290
again once you stop.

2493
02:40:46,670 --> 02:40:48,530
We want two or two, right?

2494
02:40:49,170 --> 02:40:50,370
I think the cast is strong.

2495
02:40:51,250 --> 02:40:52,070
Oh, hey, narcissist.

2496
02:40:56,070 --> 02:40:56,510
Hello?

2497
02:40:56,750 --> 02:40:57,990
Oh, it's not Narcissus.

2498
02:40:59,590 --> 02:41:01,550
Wait, I'm going to steal your stuff real quick.

2499
02:41:02,130 --> 02:41:02,470
Ma'am.

2500
02:41:03,190 --> 02:41:04,390
You won't need the rocks.

2501
02:41:04,930 --> 02:41:05,810
You're just a spider.

2502
02:41:07,610 --> 02:41:08,490
Ar... Ar...

2503
02:41:09,390 --> 02:41:10,730
I don't know how to pronounce...

2504
02:41:10,730 --> 02:41:11,350
What is that?

2505
02:41:11,510 --> 02:41:11,950
Arachai?

2506
02:41:12,190 --> 02:41:14,290
I can always make more perfectly good silk.

2507
02:41:14,830 --> 02:41:16,090
I can't always see you.

2508
02:41:18,590 --> 02:41:19,550
Hi, Arachni.

2509
02:41:19,770 --> 02:41:20,350
Oh, Arachni.

2510
02:41:20,850 --> 02:41:21,270
Sorry about all this.

2511
02:41:22,990 --> 02:41:24,370
Seeing more of one another now.

2512
02:41:25,130 --> 02:41:26,090
My task has begun.

2513
02:41:28,110 --> 02:41:28,550
Truly.

2514
02:41:29,310 --> 02:41:29,690

2515
02:41:29,770 --> 02:41:30,630

2516
02:41:30,870 --> 02:41:31,390
You have to go.

2517
02:41:31,890 --> 02:41:32,130
But first...

2518
02:41:32,130 --> 02:41:33,470
You're not fucked a spider.

2519
02:41:34,450 --> 02:41:36,370
And don't worry about any wear and tear.

2520
02:41:37,090 --> 02:41:38,350
I have plenty more in stock.

2521
02:41:40,970 --> 02:41:42,330
Oh, is she the first spider?

2522
02:41:42,730 --> 02:41:43,910
Okay, someone fucked the spider.

2523
02:41:45,110 --> 02:41:48,910
Lab Don and armor that makes you channel 40% faster.

2524
02:41:50,690 --> 02:41:52,030

2525
02:41:52,150 --> 02:41:52,970

Okay, that's fine.

2534
02:43:00,330 --> 02:43:00,890
Nice.

2535
02:43:01,850 --> 02:43:03,270
I already lost all my armor.

2536
02:43:06,880 --> 02:43:09,460
I thought I was shooting him, but apparently not.

2537
02:43:09,740 --> 02:43:09,960
Let's go.

2538
02:43:10,980 --> 02:43:14,240
Your recent descent took you deeper than my deepest roots.

2539
02:43:14,860 --> 02:43:17,460
Close to where the Titan Kronos now resides.

2540
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:19,420
And hold your mother captive.

2541
02:43:19,580 --> 02:43:21,460
Yeah, my ex is already half gone.

2542
02:43:21,800 --> 02:43:23,580
There is no way to inform us of what happened.

2543
02:43:26,300 --> 02:43:28,440
Oh, when I'm not spending mana?

2544
02:43:29,320 --> 02:43:30,320
Oh, I forgot to gift her.

2545
02:43:34,460 --> 02:43:38,560
Enemy that stops one instance of damage range, but you are
prime, but you prime.

2546
02:43:41,340 --> 02:43:44,320
One instance of your sprint forms a gust around you that
lingers.

2547
02:43:44,900 --> 02:43:47,260
Your special deals more damage and inflicts freeze.

2548
02:43:47,380 --> 02:43:48,780
Oh, okay, let's get Ice Flourish.

2549
02:43:49,880 --> 02:43:51,060
Yeah, Ice Flourish.

2550
02:43:51,180 --> 02:43:52,540
I just have to use Right Click More.

2551
02:43:54,320 --> 02:43:55,480
Like, there you go.

2552
02:43:57,760 --> 02:43:58,560
So you don't get that.

2553
02:44:01,260 --> 02:44:01,980
And then...

2554
02:44:01,980 --> 02:44:02,400
Cast!

2555
02:44:03,460 --> 02:44:04,260
And then...

2556
02:44:04,260 --> 02:44:04,580
Oh!

2557
02:44:05,860 --> 02:44:06,660
I still...

2558
02:44:06,660 --> 02:44:07,160
I don't know.

2559
02:44:07,260 --> 02:44:09,040
I think I do...

2560
02:44:09,040 --> 02:44:10,920
Oh my gosh, I don't have a lot of energy, though.

2561
02:44:16,060 --> 02:44:16,700
There you go.

2562
02:44:16,940 --> 02:44:18,880
I gotta recharge when I'm not using it.

2563
02:44:18,960 --> 02:44:19,920
Okay, we'll get more ash.

2564
02:44:21,380 --> 02:44:21,780
Worth.

2565
02:44:25,080 --> 02:44:25,480
Okay.

2566
02:44:28,080 --> 02:44:29,320
Okay, I'm recharging.

2567
02:44:31,420 --> 02:44:31,820
Okay.

2568
02:44:31,840 --> 02:44:33,880
All right, I'll get rid of all these guys.

2569
02:44:34,520 --> 02:44:35,300
I think I can charge it.

2570
02:44:35,440 --> 02:44:36,240
I can cast again.

2571
02:44:38,680 --> 02:44:39,200
Nice.

2572
02:44:40,080 --> 02:44:40,320
Yay!

2573
02:44:41,760 --> 02:44:42,800
I don't know.

2574
02:44:43,060 --> 02:44:44,400
I still don't know if I like this.

2575
02:44:46,100 --> 02:44:47,560
Heals are born.

2576
02:44:48,240 --> 02:44:48,920
Let's get born.

2577
02:44:49,780 --> 02:44:50,580
Born time.

2578
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:55,880
Yeah, I'll do.

2579
02:44:56,960 --> 02:44:58,060
Freeze so I can freeze it.

2580
02:44:59,600 --> 02:44:59,820
All right.

2581
02:45:01,820 --> 02:45:02,340
Hex!

2582
02:45:02,840 --> 02:45:04,040
That's our chest for you!

2583
02:45:04,040 --> 02:45:05,980
Because fuck you in particular.

2584
02:45:08,580 --> 02:45:10,060
Oh, are you fucking kidding me?

2585
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:11,920
Are you fucking...

2586
02:45:11,920 --> 02:45:12,360
Oh, no.

2587
02:45:12,720 --> 02:45:13,120
Oh, no.

2588
02:45:15,060 --> 02:45:16,880
Oh, I have to keep mob.

2589
02:45:18,060 --> 02:45:18,860
Okay, that's fine.

2590
02:45:19,800 --> 02:45:20,740
I'm still recharging.

2591
02:45:22,040 --> 02:45:23,040
I still have four.

2592
02:45:23,500 --> 02:45:24,780
Four HP and a dream.

2593
02:45:27,020 --> 02:45:27,330
Uh...

2594
02:45:27,640 --> 02:45:28,420
I'll do this.

2595
02:45:29,260 --> 02:45:30,960
I think my special is the best.

2596
02:45:31,120 --> 02:45:32,000
All right, healers.

2597
02:45:37,260 --> 02:45:37,660
Okay.

2598
02:45:39,400 --> 02:45:40,900
Oh my god, they're everywhere.

2599
02:45:41,720 --> 02:45:42,500
Oh, fuck!

2600
02:45:42,600 --> 02:45:43,300
Okay, they're everywhere.

2601
02:45:45,400 --> 02:45:46,480
This is so risky.

2602
02:45:53,640 --> 02:45:56,040
I want to make sure I don't take any damage.

2603
02:45:57,880 --> 02:45:59,300
I have to be careful.

2604
02:45:59,400 --> 02:46:00,520
I need my recharge.

2605
02:46:02,140 --> 02:46:03,780
Okay, I should have enough for shop now.

2606
02:46:04,800 --> 02:46:05,260
Yeah, I know.

2607
02:46:05,500 --> 02:46:06,200
If I lose...

2608
02:46:06,200 --> 02:46:08,280
I know, I don't want to lose my charge.

2609
02:46:10,620 --> 02:46:11,940
Okay, we'll grab that.

2610
02:46:13,820 --> 02:46:14,640
Hi, Poseidon.

2611
02:46:17,380 --> 02:46:18,260
I know, right?

2612
02:46:18,560 --> 02:46:19,460
Wait, Asa.

2613
02:46:20,120 --> 02:46:21,300
You're a god of time.

2614
02:46:21,400 --> 02:46:23,200
That god of the sea and hell.

2615
02:46:23,960 --> 02:46:25,100
And everything else.

2616
02:46:27,900 --> 02:46:29,300
Okay, I think one, right?

2617
02:46:32,060 --> 02:46:34,900
Many minor fines and money are worth more and you receive.

2618
02:46:35,900 --> 02:46:36,940
Oh, should I get three?

2619
02:46:37,340 --> 02:46:37,960
One or three?

2620
02:46:38,360 --> 02:46:38,680
One?

2621
02:46:39,460 --> 02:46:41,220
Yeah, we don't have Gamba, guys.

2622
02:46:42,600 --> 02:46:44,820
Uncle doesn't want to talk to me anymore.

2623
02:46:46,040 --> 02:46:47,560
A special offer of some sort.

2624
02:46:48,460 --> 02:46:53,360
I've returned as much gold as I could, but know full well it
isn't easy for you to procure the goods you provide.

2625
02:46:55,120 --> 02:46:56,060
Oh, he gave me a special...

2626
02:46:56,060 --> 02:46:57,200
Oh, a credit card!

2627
02:46:58,460 --> 02:46:59,420
Here, you know what?

2628
02:46:59,580 --> 02:47:01,160
Thanks for the credit card.

2629
02:47:01,340 --> 02:47:02,040
I'll give you a nectar.

2630
02:47:04,060 --> 02:47:04,640
Here you go.

2631
02:47:04,760 --> 02:47:06,000

2632
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:07,220
I got credit card.

2633
02:47:07,480 --> 02:47:08,680

2637
02:47:38,680 --> 02:47:41,320
i'm feeling like i'm I'm not that good with this weapon.

2638
02:47:41,600 --> 02:47:43,820
The subconscious I descend.

2639
02:47:44,880 --> 02:47:47,660
Remember well those words and those that follow.

2640
02:47:48,160 --> 02:47:51,340
Unless the shrill of battle cloud your memory.

2641
02:47:53,280 --> 02:47:55,380
To the abyss of the subconscious, I descend.

2642
02:47:55,940 --> 02:47:59,020
Night and darkness guide me to my blood beyond the grasp of
time.

2643
02:47:59,020 --> 02:47:59,460
I understand.

2644
02:47:59,620 --> 02:48:02,840
When do I fucking, like, win the test?

2645
02:48:03,020 --> 02:48:04,500
Like, when do I pass this test?

2646
02:48:05,600 --> 02:48:09,400
How many times do I have to beat her up for her to, like,
stop testing me?

2647
02:48:10,140 --> 02:48:14,780
opportunity to make the invocations in the proper place and

02:54:52,140 --> 02:54:53,140
We're in magic build.

2759
02:54:53,760 --> 02:54:53,920
Oh.

2760
02:54:54,760 --> 02:54:56,600

02:54:56,940 --> 02:54:58,140
Oh, there he is.

2762
02:54:58,900 --> 02:54:59,280
Oh, God.

2763
02:54:59,400 --> 02:55:00,180
Not these guys.

2764
02:55:00,980 --> 02:55:02,060
These guys are the worst.

2765
02:55:02,920 --> 02:55:03,760
Oh, fuck.

2766
02:55:05,120 --> 02:55:06,380
They're actually the worst.

2767
02:55:08,100 --> 02:55:09,200
Wait, that hit me?

2768
02:55:09,560 --> 02:55:10,840

Oh, no.

2771
02:55:15,280 --> 02:55:15,860
This is not good.

2772
02:55:15,920 --> 02:55:16,820
This is actually not good.

2773
02:55:16,940 --> 02:55:17,600
I'm going to stay here.

2774
02:55:19,280 --> 02:55:20,260
Oh, my God.

2775
02:55:20,280 --> 02:55:21,680
I didn't see it!

2776
02:55:22,720 --> 02:55:28,180
Oh, no, I have to use one of my death defiance in the baby
level.

2777
02:55:29,300 --> 02:55:31,640

I knew it.

2784
02:55:46,250 --> 02:55:49,590
I knew I would use death defiance accidentally here.

2785
02:55:51,450 --> 02:55:51,950
Oh, my God.

2806
02:58:04,310 --> 02:58:06,050
Oh, I guess it has two times a hit.

2807
02:58:06,750 --> 02:58:08,870
Guys, the item just wasn't that good.

2808
02:58:09,090 --> 02:58:09,490
So I just...

2809
02:58:09,490 --> 02:58:11,630

02:58:11,630 --> 02:58:12,530

Okay.

2812
02:58:13,190 --> 02:58:13,890
All right, we gotta go.

2813
02:58:14,050 --> 02:58:15,410
The anti's coming back in.

2814
02:58:18,920 --> 02:58:19,360
Oh, good.

2815
02:58:19,480 --> 02:58:20,860
You're just in time for a set.

2816
02:58:21,100 --> 02:58:23,660
Been working on a song called I Am Gonna Claw.

2817
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:25,420
Out your eyes, then drown you to death.

2818
02:58:25,520 --> 02:58:25,820
Oh.

2819
02:58:26,200 --> 02:58:27,580
Comes from a real person.

2820
02:58:29,240 --> 02:58:29,680
Like...

2821
02:58:29,680 --> 02:58:30,480
Who's the you?

2822
02:58:30,540 --> 02:58:31,220
Not me, right?

2823
02:58:32,180 --> 02:58:33,880
That isn't the one I heard on my way in.

2824
02:58:35,780 --> 02:58:39,120
No, it's not because all our songs are...

2825
02:58:39,120 --> 02:58:39,900
Oh, they're not where?

2826
02:58:40,540 --> 02:58:42,320
Each like a perfect little child.

2827
02:58:43,040 --> 02:58:44,180
Oh, I didn't get the dialogue?

2828
02:58:44,940 --> 02:58:45,120
Oh.

2829
02:58:46,140 --> 02:58:46,540
Alright.

2830
02:58:54,900 --> 02:58:56,780
That's right, the haters here!

2831
02:58:58,080 --> 02:59:00,420
Oh my god, that was a lot of damage.

2832
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:01,580
Oh my...

2833
02:59:01,580 --> 02:59:02,820
I don't remember how I could kill.

2834
02:59:03,040 --> 02:59:04,280
Oh my god, I'm dead.

2835
02:59:04,360 --> 02:59:04,800
I'm dead.

2836
02:59:04,980 --> 02:59:05,400
I'm dead.

2837
02:59:05,760 --> 02:59:07,020
I'm already dead.

2838
02:59:10,020 --> 02:59:11,140
It's already...

2839
02:59:11,140 --> 02:59:13,760
It's already over before it could begin.

2840
02:59:14,820 --> 02:59:17,000
Oh, yeah.

2841
02:59:17,480 --> 02:59:17,920
Oh, yeah.

2842
02:59:18,040 --> 02:59:19,380
No, this is not good, guys.

2843
02:59:23,740 --> 02:59:24,760
Okay, it's fine.

2844
02:59:25,800 --> 02:59:26,460
Oh, shit.

2845
02:59:26,760 --> 02:59:27,540
Oh, it's okay.

2846
02:59:27,560 --> 02:59:28,960
I have one more death defiance.

2847
02:59:29,580 --> 02:59:30,320
That's right.

2848
02:59:30,420 --> 02:59:31,980
This is where it's for, girl.

2849
02:59:35,600 --> 02:59:36,160
Okay.

2850
02:59:37,140 --> 02:59:37,780
That's okay.

2851
02:59:37,800 --> 02:59:39,060
Okay, I got rid of your bases.

2852
02:59:39,220 --> 02:59:39,680
That's right.

2853
02:59:39,880 --> 02:59:40,360
How can you?

2854
02:59:40,440 --> 02:59:41,820
You can't sing acapella, girl.

2855
02:59:41,900 --> 02:59:42,740
You're not that good.

2856
02:59:51,840 --> 02:59:52,220
Okay.

2857
02:59:56,260 --> 02:59:57,060
Oh, shit.

2858
02:59:57,220 --> 02:59:58,120
Okay, I ran into her.

2859
02:59:58,180 --> 02:59:59,000
That was my bad.

2860
03:00:00,420 --> 03:00:01,780
Okay, I ran into her again.

2861
03:00:01,900 --> 03:00:02,660
That's my bad.

2862
03:00:06,710 --> 03:00:07,090
Nice.

2863
03:00:07,550 --> 03:00:08,110
That's right.

2864
03:00:08,210 --> 03:00:09,450
Can't keep tempo now.

2865
03:00:15,900 --> 03:00:16,240
Oh, God.

2866
03:00:16,360 --> 03:00:19,580
I have to kill her bases so she can't sing acapella.

2867
03:00:21,120 --> 03:00:21,600
That's right.

2868
03:00:21,620 --> 03:00:26,860
What you gotta do When you have to sing Acapella, girl!

2869
03:00:32,620 --> 03:00:33,540
Okay, it's fine.

2870
03:00:36,420 --> 03:00:37,320
There you go.

2871
03:00:39,880 --> 03:00:39,960
Oh, wait.

2872
03:00:40,020 --> 03:00:40,700
I can just kill her.

2873
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:41,140
Here.

2874
03:00:41,340 --> 03:00:41,900
Oh, shit!

2875
03:00:42,020 --> 03:00:42,260
It's okay.

2876
03:00:42,360 --> 03:00:43,140
I can still just kill her.

2877
03:00:48,220 --> 03:00:48,600
Alright.

2878
03:00:49,040 --> 03:00:50,880
I did have to use my Deftify.

2879
03:00:50,940 --> 03:00:52,240
I have no more Deftify.

2880
03:00:52,760 --> 03:00:53,520
That's awkward.

2881
03:00:55,500 --> 03:00:56,800
It's a little awkward.

2882
03:00:56,960 --> 03:00:58,740
I don't have Death Defiance anymore.

2883
03:00:59,460 --> 03:00:59,820
Apologies.

2884
03:01:01,460 --> 03:01:01,640
Yep.

2885
03:01:02,080 --> 03:01:02,700
Technical difficulties.

2886
03:01:03,200 --> 03:01:04,280
Guys, no refunds.

2887
03:01:04,320 --> 03:01:05,220
No refunds.

2888
03:01:06,140 --> 03:01:07,920
The haters won again.

2889
03:01:08,080 --> 03:01:08,620
Let's go.

2890
03:01:10,880 --> 03:01:16,680
Collected works of Sailor Slang, Skiller, and her sirens lie
conspicuously scattered here.

2891
03:01:17,200 --> 03:01:22,400
A parting vengeance on the sensibility of those who dare to
take a closer look.

2892
03:01:22,440 --> 03:01:22,840
That's right.

2893
03:01:22,960 --> 03:01:24,180
Concerts canceled, guys.

2894
03:01:27,520 --> 03:01:32,880

2899
03:02:01,050 --> 03:02:01,270

Are you concerned?

2901
03:02:02,150 --> 03:02:03,770
My task just isn't difficult enough.

2902
03:02:04,550 --> 03:02:05,750
Going a bit too swimmingly.

2903
03:02:06,130 --> 03:02:08,690
Toki, I sold my house for this content.

2904
03:02:09,190 --> 03:02:09,670
How?

2905
03:02:10,150 --> 03:02:12,050
I assumed death defiance.

2906
03:02:12,770 --> 03:02:13,590
Actually, yes.

2907
03:02:13,650 --> 03:02:15,110
I was a little worried about that.

2908
03:02:15,430 --> 03:02:16,630
You got past the sirens.

2909
03:02:17,230 --> 03:02:17,730
What next?

2910
03:02:17,810 --> 03:02:19,270
You'll go kill Kronos and then what?

2911
03:02:19,310 --> 03:02:20,310
I mean, I could have.

2912
03:02:20,550 --> 03:02:21,250
Let's not do anything.

2913
03:02:21,350 --> 03:02:22,310
I could have!

2914
03:02:23,710 --> 03:02:24,190
Oopsie.

2915
03:02:24,530 --> 03:02:25,010
No!

2916
03:02:25,610 --> 03:02:26,090
No!

2917
03:02:26,090 --> 03:02:26,930
I don't depreciate.

2918
03:02:33,050 --> 03:02:34,930
What does she do to me?

2919
03:02:35,250 --> 03:02:35,910
Oh, okay.

2920
03:02:36,570 --> 03:02:37,490
Back at it again.

2921
03:02:41,990 --> 03:02:44,250
Maybe they should have just made the game harder.

2922
03:02:44,670 --> 03:02:46,090
It's the punishing me.

2923
03:02:49,010 --> 03:02:50,170
Here we go again.

2924
03:02:51,170 --> 03:02:51,630
You know what?

2925
03:02:51,870 --> 03:02:52,390
Fuck you.

2926
03:02:52,470 --> 03:02:53,510
I know what to do.

2927
03:02:54,150 --> 03:02:58,280
Ha ha ha ha.

2928
03:02:59,760 --> 03:03:01,300
Guys, what am I...

2929
03:03:01,300 --> 03:03:06,480
If they're gonna curse me, I might as well go God mode.

2930
03:03:12,850 --> 03:03:14,590
That's all I'm saying.

2931
03:03:14,990 --> 03:03:16,650
Like, I might as well.

2932
03:03:19,330 --> 03:03:21,250
Do it, do it.

2933
03:03:21,350 --> 03:03:23,390
I'm so thankful.

2934
03:03:24,310 --> 03:03:26,150
Don't go there, Joki.

2935
03:03:26,570 --> 03:03:28,250
You're better than her.

2936
03:03:29,470 --> 03:03:30,310
Am I, though?

2937
03:03:30,590 --> 03:03:31,150
Am I?

2938
03:03:31,990 --> 03:03:33,870
curse me and I'm mad.

2939
03:03:38,250 --> 03:03:40,750
She's the one that cursed me!

2940
03:03:45,650 --> 03:03:46,130
Okay.

2941
03:03:52,140 --> 03:03:53,460
I need to get her out.

2942
03:03:53,620 --> 03:03:54,760
I don't like the Medusa.

2943
03:03:55,120 --> 03:03:57,540
I think the Medusa one is the...

2944
03:03:57,540 --> 03:03:59,940
The Medusa is the one that I don't like.

2945
03:04:02,720 --> 03:04:02,920
Alright.

2946
03:04:06,240 --> 03:04:09,800
Like, I had to use two Deft of Fire to get here, Eris.

2947
03:04:12,960 --> 03:04:13,600
Alright.

2948
03:04:14,140 --> 03:04:16,440
Your specials create one projectile.

2949
03:04:17,260 --> 03:04:21,240
Your attacks linger for two and launch back towards you
after you dash.

2950
03:04:21,680 --> 03:04:21,680
What?

2951
03:04:22,960 --> 03:04:23,460
Oh.

2952
03:04:24,560 --> 03:04:26,140
Oh, I feel like three.

2953
03:04:26,960 --> 03:04:27,660
Yeah, three.

2954
03:04:28,360 --> 03:04:29,700
I need more range.

2955
03:04:32,890 --> 03:04:34,830
I definitely need more range.

2956
03:04:36,550 --> 03:04:37,670
There's the other one.

2957
03:04:40,230 --> 03:04:42,150
Where the fuck is the other boon?

2958
03:04:45,930 --> 03:04:48,170
Where am I missing it?

2959
03:04:49,490 --> 03:04:50,070
Oh hey, tree.

2960
03:04:50,310 --> 03:04:51,150
Oh this should work, right?

2961
03:04:52,650 --> 03:04:53,690
Oh nice.

2962
03:04:59,480 --> 03:05:00,040
Alright, that's good.

2963
03:05:00,520 --> 03:05:03,080
Oh my god, not the fucking shadow man.

2964
03:05:04,140 --> 03:05:04,640
Oh no.

2965
03:05:06,460 --> 03:05:08,180
It's okay, I have the moon beam.

2966
03:05:08,840 --> 03:05:09,860
Moon beam power!

2967
03:05:11,320 --> 03:05:13,180
I know, but I know.

2968
03:05:15,240 --> 03:05:15,560
Transform!

2969
03:05:16,880 --> 03:05:16,920
Transform!

2970
03:05:16,920 --> 03:05:16,980
Oh!

2971
03:05:17,420 --> 03:05:19,620
Rushing damage surrounds foes and inflicts weak.

2972
03:05:19,820 --> 03:05:20,940
Your weak effects are more potent.

2973
03:05:21,000 --> 03:05:22,260
Do I have other weaks yet?

2974
03:05:23,180 --> 03:05:23,820
I do.

2975
03:05:24,100 --> 03:05:24,900
I'm cast.

2976
03:05:27,180 --> 03:05:27,500
Uh...

2977
03:05:29,080 --> 03:05:29,920
I don't know.

2978
03:05:30,200 --> 03:05:31,100
One or three?

2979
03:05:31,920 --> 03:05:32,720
The moon.

2980
03:05:34,920 --> 03:05:35,240
Two?

2981
03:05:35,920 --> 03:05:37,260
I guess two.

2982
03:05:37,740 --> 03:05:38,560
That's more power.

2983
03:05:40,000 --> 03:05:40,320
Two?

2984
03:05:40,520 --> 03:05:40,820
Alright.

2985
03:05:41,260 --> 03:05:42,300
My heart.

2986
03:05:44,420 --> 03:05:49,020
I want to make sure I'm not missing any, like, those, like,
bonus boons.

2987
03:05:50,080 --> 03:05:50,920
Demeter Posada.

2988
03:05:51,820 --> 03:05:53,280
I mean, I could have Freeze.

2989
03:05:53,500 --> 03:05:54,280
Can I still get Freeze?

2990
03:05:54,900 --> 03:05:55,680
I can, right?

2991
03:05:57,900 --> 03:05:59,340
God, I fucking hate her.

2992
03:06:01,900 --> 03:06:04,160
Can I still get Freeze with my attack?

2993
03:06:09,210 --> 03:06:09,630
Like...

2994
03:06:10,110 --> 03:06:10,530
Yeah?

2995
03:06:10,810 --> 03:06:11,770
All right, we'll go...

2996
03:06:11,770 --> 03:06:13,270
We'll see if we can get Freeze on attack.

2997
03:06:16,870 --> 03:06:26,150
god fuck this bitch okay i have to get rid of the queen

03:06:50,260 --> 03:06:50,880
I'm dead.

3001
03:06:51,100 --> 03:06:51,800
I'm so dead.

3002
03:06:55,100 --> 03:06:58,040
The worst part is, like, I can't even get too close to her
because of it.

3003
03:06:58,640 --> 03:06:59,200
There we go.

3004
03:07:02,820 --> 03:07:03,780
Stupid snakes.

3005
03:07:06,040 --> 03:07:08,820
This is why Zeus turned you into a snake.

3006
03:07:12,380 --> 03:07:14,540
Your sprint for his weren't clear enough encounters.

3007
03:07:14,740 --> 03:07:17,240
A random boon you have gains rarity.

3008

Demeter.

03:09:22,670 --> 03:09:25,630
That's gonna be more at max HP, but I don't think it
matters.

3022
03:09:29,210 --> 03:09:32,650
It gives me Demeter and Boone and Apollo.

3023
03:09:33,550 --> 03:09:35,310
But that's just gives me magic and health.

3024
03:09:35,890 --> 03:09:39,870
We want magic health or Demeter or more Boone?

3025
03:09:40,670 --> 03:09:41,690

Okay.

3028
03:09:46,710 --> 03:09:47,350
Left?

3029
03:09:48,510 --> 03:09:48,970
Alright.

3030

I survive if I can survive if I can live guys that's the

Oh god.

3035
03:10:29,020 --> 03:10:29,360
Alright.

3036
03:10:34,380 --> 03:10:35,380
I hate you, Ares.

03:10:39,140 --> 03:10:40,260
Found you at last.

3039
03:10:41,580 --> 03:10:42,800
Princess of the Underworld.

3040
03:10:43,080 --> 03:10:45,540
I regret having to contact you at such a time.

3041
03:10:45,980 --> 03:10:48,480
It's not my custom to intervene during moments of doom.

3042
03:10:49,040 --> 03:10:49,740
Only to observe.

3043
03:10:49,840 --> 03:10:51,680
Oh shit, do I get a third chance?

3044
03:10:52,820 --> 03:10:53,240
Hello?

3045
03:10:53,380 --> 03:10:53,960
Moments of doom.

3046
03:10:55,280 --> 03:11:03,780
lord morose emissary of the three fates so your sisters hurt
me after all oh the three fates they actually respond oh

3050
03:11:25,280 --> 03:11:26,580
an offering, too.

3051
03:11:28,220 --> 03:11:29,180
It didn't ghost me.

3052
03:11:29,460 --> 03:11:31,680
It just takes, like, three to five business days.

3053
03:11:32,100 --> 03:11:32,660
He's gone.

3054
03:11:37,340 --> 03:11:37,540
Alright.

3055
03:11:37,740 --> 03:11:38,960
I must be hiding for a bit.

3056
03:11:39,980 --> 03:11:40,140
Why?

3057
03:11:41,660 --> 03:11:42,900
Oh, hey, is that...

3058
03:11:42,900 --> 03:11:43,780
Yeah, that's it, right?

3059
03:11:44,260 --> 03:11:45,760
This is from the three fates.

3060
03:11:46,500 --> 03:11:47,160
Oh, nice!

3061
03:11:48,880 --> 03:11:54,480
Preveal and the Daughter of God, there shall temporary
setback, which is the underworld and prevail and battle

3062
03:11:54,480 --> 03:11:54,820
there.

3063
03:11:55,300 --> 03:11:59,080
And meet the Huntress, the Messenger, Give out five.

3064
03:11:59,200 --> 03:11:59,960
I mean, that's easy.

3065
03:12:00,140 --> 03:12:01,520
I can get that done.

3066
03:12:02,220 --> 03:12:04,680
Sister blades, crescent, shadow of death.

3067
03:12:05,040 --> 03:12:06,640
Okay, I got one of the things.

3068
03:12:07,220 --> 03:12:08,040
From the shadows.

3069
03:12:08,900 --> 03:12:09,420
Aha.

3070
03:12:10,240 --> 03:12:10,680
All right.

3071
03:12:11,120 --> 03:12:12,640
What else can I make?

3072
03:12:12,780 --> 03:12:13,780
Oh, I can make...

3073
03:12:13,780 --> 03:12:18,040
Okay, become alerted to a vow that may sometimes be found in
any...

3074
03:12:18,040 --> 03:12:18,660
Oh, okay.

3075
03:12:20,720 --> 03:12:21,240
What?

3076
03:12:22,320 --> 03:12:25,800
Mostly used with incantation involving...

3077
03:12:27,800 --> 03:12:29,460
How much do I have?

3078
03:12:30,140 --> 03:12:31,760
How many plants do I have anyway?

3079
03:12:33,100 --> 03:12:34,000
I have...

3080
03:12:34,000 --> 03:12:35,220
Oh, I have just enough for two.

3081
03:12:35,800 --> 03:12:35,800
Nice.

3082
03:12:43,670 --> 03:12:44,210
Nice.

3083
03:12:45,510 --> 03:12:46,550
Alright, get me that soil.

3084
03:12:47,010 --> 03:12:47,370
Great Gaia.

3085
03:12:47,810 --> 03:12:49,970
Share your secrets if my worth is true.

3086
03:12:50,690 --> 03:12:52,050
You know gamers don't look down.

3087
03:12:52,630 --> 03:12:53,690
So moat it be.

3088
03:12:55,010 --> 03:12:55,550
Yay!

3089
03:12:55,910 --> 03:12:57,070
We can plant now!

3090
03:12:57,190 --> 03:12:58,070
We can garden!

3091
03:12:58,510 --> 03:12:59,230
Let's go!

3092
03:12:59,350 --> 03:13:00,490
The fate's indulge.

3093
03:13:00,610 --> 03:13:08,330
you after all that is their scroll beside your tent it
followed you out of the timely farm simulator perhaps it can

3094
03:13:08,330 --> 03:13:16,490
provide some answers nice would that it does the fated list
has tasked me with ensuring certain day gardening fulfilled

3095
03:13:16,490 --> 03:13:26,890
those as little else as yet may it reward your efforts at
least oh god but do not expect the fates to always favor you

3096
03:13:26,890 --> 03:13:30,870
the bane of our enemy is not necessarily our friend.

3097
03:13:31,650 --> 03:13:31,710
Okay.

3098
03:13:32,690 --> 03:13:33,450
What do you mean?

3099
03:13:34,270 --> 03:13:35,850
Why won't they be my friend?

3100
03:13:36,050 --> 03:13:37,010
There's something by the broker.

3101
03:13:37,310 --> 03:13:38,190
Oh yeah, what's this?

3102
03:13:38,630 --> 03:13:38,970
Oh?

3103
03:13:41,230 --> 03:13:45,190
One credit card gives me what how many?

3104
03:13:45,590 --> 03:13:45,990
Oh.

3105
03:13:47,210 --> 03:13:49,090
It gives me 20 ashes.

3106
03:13:50,510 --> 03:13:51,290
Do I want that?

3107
03:13:53,210 --> 03:13:54,690
Or should I save for psyche?

3108
03:13:54,950 --> 03:13:56,450
I feel like I should save, right?

3109
03:13:58,870 --> 03:14:00,870
Should I spend I did her save, guys.

3110
03:14:01,230 --> 03:14:01,930
Save it for Psyche.

3111
03:14:03,070 --> 03:14:04,090
Alright, I'll save it.

3112
03:14:05,230 --> 03:14:06,410
Oh, hey, Nemesis!

3113
03:14:06,970 --> 03:14:09,310
Knocked your scrawny ass all the way back here.

3114
03:14:10,450 --> 03:14:13,550
It's insane that she's sending you out on foot, all on your
own.

3115
03:14:15,470 --> 03:14:19,070
You're fortunate you have even this responsibility for all
your questioning of all disease.

3116
03:14:19,110 --> 03:14:21,230
Yeah, what are you doing with your life?

3117
03:14:22,250 --> 03:14:23,010
Oh, shut up.

3118
03:14:23,190 --> 03:14:23,590
Exactly.

3119
03:14:23,730 --> 03:14:24,530
Oh, y'all see?

3120
03:14:24,830 --> 03:14:26,010
God nerfed, didn't I?

3121
03:14:26,810 --> 03:14:27,950
I'm more important than you.

3122
03:14:27,990 --> 03:14:28,990
I'm the princess of hell.

3123
03:14:30,110 --> 03:14:31,830
You're just a...

3124
03:14:33,590 --> 03:14:35,510
You're barely a fucking god.

3125
03:14:36,890 --> 03:14:37,710
Yeah, no, I fucking...

3126
03:14:37,710 --> 03:14:38,590
No, I saw her twice.

3127
03:14:39,030 --> 03:14:39,630
No, I know.

3128
03:14:40,190 --> 03:14:41,510
She's trying to stop me.

3129
03:14:41,810 --> 03:14:42,890
Or at least slow me down.

3130
03:14:43,450 --> 03:14:45,510
And she knows too much about our intentions.

3131
03:14:46,510 --> 03:14:47,370
What do we do?

3132
03:14:47,990 --> 03:14:49,210
Yeah, you're just an incarnate.

3133
03:14:51,350 --> 03:14:51,750
Yeah.

3134
03:14:52,230 --> 03:14:53,370
Yeah, that's what I'm saying!

3135
03:14:53,490 --> 03:14:54,650
Why are they on my side?

3136
03:14:55,290 --> 03:14:57,410
She doesn't know the half of what we've planned.

3137
03:14:57,930 --> 03:14:59,510
Besides her boredom drives her...

3138
03:14:59,830 --> 03:15:00,670
Why don't we just kill her?

3139
03:15:05,310 --> 03:15:06,790
I don't understand.

3140
03:15:07,370 --> 03:15:09,110
Why don't we just kill her?

3141
03:15:13,410 --> 03:15:15,670
Why do we let her do this to us?

3142
03:15:16,810 --> 03:15:18,210
Here, I got you something.

3143
03:15:20,570 --> 03:15:22,070
Here's my necklace.

3144
03:15:22,690 --> 03:15:24,910
Or temptations while I'm on duty or off.

3145
03:15:25,870 --> 03:15:27,950
You're doing this because you want something for me anyway.

3146
03:15:27,990 --> 03:15:29,350
There's always a way to kill a guy.

3147
03:15:32,610 --> 03:15:33,410
Yay, freestyle.

3148
03:15:34,710 --> 03:15:35,370
Got an evil eye.

3149
03:15:35,730 --> 03:15:36,530
Okay, that's...

3150
03:15:36,530 --> 03:15:37,890
Okay, I got an evil eye.

3151
03:15:38,010 --> 03:15:39,350
I hope it's not that evil.

3152
03:15:40,150 --> 03:15:41,290
I mean, I have a lot of nectar.

3153
03:15:41,510 --> 03:15:42,310
I might as well just gift it.

3154
03:15:42,370 --> 03:15:43,130
Hey, Odysseus.

3155
03:15:43,610 --> 03:15:45,670
Got you something here I wanted you to have.

3156
03:15:46,350 --> 03:15:48,150
For always keeping an eye out.

3157
03:15:50,330 --> 03:15:51,790
Yeah, but there must be a cooldown.

3158
03:15:52,070 --> 03:15:54,170
If we kill her, then I can at least...

3159
03:15:54,170 --> 03:15:56,010
There's a cooldown for them to respawn.

3160
03:15:58,870 --> 03:15:59,130
Yeah.

3161
03:16:00,530 --> 03:16:01,650
There you go.

3162
03:16:01,870 --> 03:16:02,230
Yay!

3163
03:16:04,490 --> 03:16:05,490
Thank you.

3164
03:16:06,830 --> 03:16:07,770
Okay, I'm glad.

3165
03:16:09,090 --> 03:16:11,710
I can gift you something while you're sleeping, right?

3166
03:16:12,250 --> 03:16:14,770
May you have pleasant dreams for as long as you slumber.

3167
03:16:15,570 --> 03:16:19,690
And if and when you finally wake, know that this nectar
shall be waiting for you.

3168
03:16:23,310 --> 03:16:23,770
Yay!

3169
03:16:24,090 --> 03:16:25,710
Where would the gift come from, though?

3170
03:16:25,870 --> 03:16:26,710
If he's sleeping.

3171
03:16:29,830 --> 03:16:32,690
I love the voice acting so much because it means I don't
have to read.

3172
03:16:33,510 --> 03:16:34,770
Welcome to the what?

3173
03:16:37,170 --> 03:16:38,170
Wait, he didn't give me anything.

3174
03:16:38,310 --> 03:16:39,050
That bitch.

3175
03:16:40,530 --> 03:16:42,150
I'll give her stuff too.

3176
03:16:42,950 --> 03:16:43,350
Headmistress.

3177
03:16:43,810 --> 03:16:46,090
If it isn't inappropriate, I have a little gift.

3178
03:16:46,550 --> 03:16:48,790
Seeing as your personal supply ran out a while back.

3179
03:16:52,870 --> 03:16:54,870
She is sleeping too.

3180
03:16:54,870 --> 03:16:57,630
I should be allowed to, like, rob something.

3181
03:16:57,710 --> 03:16:59,690
Like, not rob, like, take something from.

3182
03:16:59,830 --> 03:17:01,550
after I give her something.

3183
03:17:02,130 --> 03:17:03,090
It's a trade.

3184
03:17:05,950 --> 03:17:06,510
Yay!

3185
03:17:07,210 --> 03:17:08,030
Silver wheel.

3186
03:17:08,970 --> 03:17:09,810
I can have this.

3187
03:17:11,690 --> 03:17:12,090
Yay!

3188
03:17:12,970 --> 03:17:13,770
Okay, I should...

3189
03:17:13,770 --> 03:17:14,570
That's enough, right?

3190
03:17:15,170 --> 03:17:15,470
Yeah.

3191
03:17:15,690 --> 03:17:16,830
This wasn't on the list before.

3192
03:17:18,090 --> 03:17:18,370
Oh?

3193
03:17:19,290 --> 03:17:19,850
Oh.

3194
03:17:20,690 --> 03:17:23,070
There's still one where I gifted five...

3195
03:17:25,570 --> 03:17:26,610
Those are not...

3196
03:17:26,610 --> 03:17:27,190
Oh, here we go.

3197
03:17:28,590 --> 03:17:28,850
Yay!

3198
03:17:29,450 --> 03:17:29,810
I did a...

3199
03:17:29,830 --> 03:17:43,750
prophecy I did it okay I should be able to increase my grasp
I increased in my psyche the cast makes you impervious when

3200
03:17:43,750 --> 03:17:53,070
you have less than your attack and special deal 30% damage
you gain plus three your sprint is 5% faster you have I feel

3201
03:17:53,070 --> 03:17:54,470
like the Huntress card.

3202
03:17:56,210 --> 03:17:56,410
Yeah.

3203
03:17:58,070 --> 03:18:00,390
Since I always have, like, less in it.

3204
03:18:02,770 --> 03:18:05,750
The next guardian loses minus 5%.

3205
03:18:05,750 --> 03:18:06,470
You take minus.

3206
03:18:06,590 --> 03:18:08,590
You gain 50% this night.

3207
03:18:09,030 --> 03:18:10,370
We're going to fully restore.

3208
03:18:11,350 --> 03:18:13,030
Gain a plus 100 this night.

3209
03:18:13,150 --> 03:18:16,070
Deal 20% damage to the last four that you vanquish.

3210
03:18:16,690 --> 03:18:18,630
Okay, yeah, that doesn't fucking matter.

3211
03:18:23,270 --> 03:18:24,550
Oh, I could buy it.

3212
03:18:24,570 --> 03:18:25,010
You're right.

3213
03:18:25,810 --> 03:18:26,730
Oh, I could buy another.

3214
03:18:27,830 --> 03:18:28,430
Oh, yeah.

3215
03:18:28,470 --> 03:18:29,670
I could buy another card.

3216
03:18:30,090 --> 03:18:31,570
I can't equip it, I feel like.

3217
03:18:31,810 --> 03:18:31,870
Right?

3218
03:18:32,290 --> 03:18:32,670
Can I?

3219
03:18:33,450 --> 03:18:34,570
You cast momentarily.

3220
03:18:34,870 --> 03:18:37,030
Sprint lets you pass through most foes in your way.

3221
03:18:37,830 --> 03:18:39,890
Your castment makes you impervious and move.

3222
03:18:40,130 --> 03:18:40,930
Okay, I should grab that.

3223
03:18:40,950 --> 03:18:41,610
Oh, I can!

3224
03:18:42,130 --> 03:18:42,390
Nice.

3225
03:18:46,280 --> 03:18:47,780
I should be able to get the blades now.

3226
03:18:47,940 --> 03:18:48,060
Yeah.

3227
03:18:49,580 --> 03:18:49,980
Yay!

3228
03:18:51,560 --> 03:18:52,360
New weapon.

3229
03:18:52,500 --> 03:18:53,540
Okay, let's try this weapon.

3230
03:18:53,880 --> 03:18:54,280

3237
03:20:05,460 --> 03:20:06,560
The lightning sigil.

3238
03:20:08,840 --> 03:20:08,960
Zeus?

3239
03:20:11,220 --> 03:20:11,420
No?

3240
03:20:11,700 --> 03:20:11,840
Oh.

3241
03:20:11,960 --> 03:20:14,220
What does the moon mean?

3242
03:20:18,060 --> 03:20:19,160
Yay, Zeus!

3243
03:20:19,420 --> 03:20:19,980
The whore!

3244
03:20:22,380 --> 03:20:23,620
The man's done.

3245
03:20:23,960 --> 03:20:25,700
To help us settle an old score.

3246
03:20:26,500 --> 03:20:29,570
If you possess your father's strength, then we have the
advantage.

3247
03:20:32,300 --> 03:20:33,800
We got a Zooch blessing.

3248
03:20:35,020 --> 03:20:36,820
Your attacks inflict blitz.

3249
03:20:38,600 --> 03:20:39,160
What is true?

3250
03:20:39,320 --> 03:20:40,140
He fucks everything.

3251
03:20:42,040 --> 03:20:43,520
Whoa, I mean, you're not wrong.

3252
03:20:44,480 --> 03:20:45,660
Yeah, you guys didn't know.

3253
03:20:45,700 --> 03:20:51,580
Okay, for those who don't know, his lord, is he literally
fucks anything that moves.

3254
03:20:51,720 --> 03:20:53,140
Even a goose.

3255
03:20:54,460 --> 03:20:54,780
One?

3256
03:20:56,140 --> 03:20:56,940
Or a swan.

3257
03:20:57,540 --> 03:20:58,320
He doesn't care.

3258
03:20:59,100 --> 03:21:01,280
And if you reject him, he turns you into a snake.

3259
03:21:01,360 --> 03:21:03,060
That's where we got Medusa.

3260
03:21:10,650 --> 03:21:11,230
Oh, yeah, sorry.

3261
03:21:11,410 --> 03:21:12,190
He was the goose.

3262
03:21:13,770 --> 03:21:18,270
Bro, I can't remember all his fucking fucked up sex stories,
guys.

3263
03:21:18,810 --> 03:21:19,050

3264
03:21:20,850 --> 03:21:21,970
I can't...

3265
03:21:21,970 --> 03:21:23,270
I can't remember.

3266
03:21:24,970 --> 03:21:26,190
That was Athena.

3267
03:21:26,650 --> 03:21:29,010
Bro, I know all the gods are fucking assholes.

3268
03:21:29,750 --> 03:21:32,450
I just grouped them all together because they're all bad
people.

3269
03:21:40,090 --> 03:21:48,170
There's too many scandals I don't know One or two guys Which
one's better

Okay.

3273
03:22:14,360 --> 03:22:15,880

3274
03:22:15,880 --> 03:22:16,240
Okay.

3275
03:22:16,900 --> 03:22:20,180
I think the staff has been my favorite weapon so far.

3276
03:22:20,660 --> 03:22:21,300
But I don't know.

3277
03:22:25,000 --> 03:22:26,480
Oh my god, that was fast.

3278
03:22:27,100 --> 03:22:28,480
I can't tell yet.

3279
03:22:28,580 --> 03:22:31,600
I think the staff has definitely been my favorite weapon
though.

3280
03:22:37,240 --> 03:22:37,800
Okay.

3281
03:22:38,960 --> 03:22:40,620
Because it has a good between...

3282
03:22:41,200 --> 03:22:42,600
It's like a good balance between...

3283
03:22:42,620 --> 03:22:51,180
the two the river coquitis winds through endless misty
passageways the wailing souls within its languid waters all

Oh, that's bad.

3294
03:24:18,950 --> 03:24:20,070
I did not expect that.

3295
03:24:20,630 --> 03:24:26,370
I was like, where the fuck did he come from?

3296
03:24:27,390 --> 03:24:29,490
That was a long-ass range.

3297
03:24:35,350 --> 03:24:36,170
Alright, there you go.

3298
03:24:39,740 --> 03:24:41,200
Yeah, that was fucking bullshit.

3299
03:24:45,100 --> 03:24:45,680
Okay.

Okay, fuck it.

03:24:56,300 --> 03:24:58,100

3304
03:24:59,200 --> 03:24:59,640

I don't have enough.

3308
03:25:05,080 --> 03:25:06,460
Lord Keron, I've returned.

3309
03:25:06,640 --> 03:25:06,920
Hello!

3310
03:25:07,280 --> 03:25:08,800
I met one of your brothers, Lord Keron.

3311
03:25:09,440 --> 03:25:10,200
It was Moros.

3312
03:25:10,840 --> 03:25:12,640
He delivered to me a certain artifact.

3313
03:25:13,080 --> 03:25:14,020
But then was gone.

3314
03:25:15,700 --> 03:25:16,640
Oh, it's a teleport?

3315
03:25:20,070 --> 03:25:25,130

03:25:27,650 --> 03:25:28,890

3318
03:25:31,950 --> 03:25:34,150
Oh, it does a teleport behind you.

03:27:02,390 --> 03:27:03,170
Lightning from on high.

3335
03:27:04,630 --> 03:27:05,750
Oh, I wish we grabbed this.

3336
03:27:07,250 --> 03:27:07,650
Yeah.

3337
03:27:09,170 --> 03:27:10,290
Each time I strike.

3338
03:27:11,130 --> 03:27:11,850
And I do a lot.

3339
03:27:11,970 --> 03:27:12,610
Yeah, oh my god.

3340
03:27:12,790 --> 03:27:13,270
Oh my god.

3341
03:27:13,390 --> 03:27:13,770
They're dead.

3342
03:27:16,230 --> 03:27:16,990
They're fucking dead.

3343
03:27:17,630 --> 03:27:19,690
Yeah, that's- this shit is strong.

3344

There you go.

Boon or heart?

3347
03:27:35,740 --> 03:27:39,280
I feel like- I can upgrade my stuff, yeah.

3348
03:27:40,540 --> 03:27:42,000
This one's hard to decide.

3349
03:27:45,260 --> 03:27:45,920
Okay, nice.

3350
03:27:48,480 --> 03:27:48,980
Okay, oh.

3351
03:27:49,900 --> 03:27:51,620
That's right, can't get me.

3352
03:27:52,440 --> 03:27:52,880
Boomerang!

3353
03:27:54,920 --> 03:27:55,360
Boomerang!

3354
03:27:57,720 --> 03:27:58,500
Fast rep!

3355
03:27:59,000 --> 03:27:59,540
The power!

3356
03:28:02,850 --> 03:28:04,330
Okay, this is strong as hell.

3357
03:28:04,990 --> 03:28:05,530
I like this.

3358
03:28:05,850 --> 03:28:07,050
I'm getting more used to it.

3359
03:28:08,250 --> 03:28:09,490
Okay, your attacks and flip-flips.

3360
03:28:09,850 --> 03:28:10,270
Your strike.

3361
03:28:10,750 --> 03:28:11,190
Four!

3362
03:28:11,410 --> 03:28:12,490
Okay, I don't need magic.

3363
03:28:12,670 --> 03:28:13,870
Okay, one or three, guys.

3364
03:28:14,130 --> 03:28:14,630
One or three.

3365
03:28:15,110 --> 03:28:16,410
I'm sorry, upgrade time.

3366
03:28:19,050 --> 03:28:19,490
Palm.

3367
03:28:19,810 --> 03:28:20,490
Three, right?

3368
03:28:25,240 --> 03:28:26,280
That's right!

3369
03:28:28,020 --> 03:28:29,020
More lightning!

3370
03:28:30,440 --> 03:28:31,720
Aphrodite or Apollo?

3371
03:28:31,880 --> 03:28:34,820
For my build, who would offer me better shit?

3372
03:28:35,220 --> 03:28:35,760
Chat.

3373
03:28:37,360 --> 03:28:38,220
Apollo Aphrodite.

3374
03:28:39,040 --> 03:28:42,100
I feel like I don't know well enough about what they offer
me.

3375
03:28:42,540 --> 03:28:42,920
Apollo?

3376
03:28:43,940 --> 03:28:45,100
Don't think with your...

3377
03:28:45,100 --> 03:28:47,080
Guys, don't think with your dick right now.

3378
03:28:47,220 --> 03:28:47,560
I need...

3379
03:28:51,420 --> 03:28:53,060
I don't think...

3380
03:28:53,060 --> 03:28:54,020
Don't think I was...

3381
03:28:54,360 --> 03:28:55,640
think what's your pee-pee right now?

3382
03:28:58,760 --> 03:29:00,720
Apollo or Aphrodite?

3383
03:29:01,500 --> 03:29:01,620
What?

3384
03:29:04,800 --> 03:29:08,520
But what if I'm thinking with my heart, Doki?

3385
03:29:11,020 --> 03:29:11,880
Too late.

3386
03:29:12,300 --> 03:29:15,460
I am thinking with my pee-pee and I say Apollo.

3387
03:29:20,420 --> 03:29:21,740
Okay, okay.

3388
03:29:21,880 --> 03:29:23,660
I'm thinking with both.

3389
03:29:24,360 --> 03:29:26,080
of heart choices.

3390
03:29:27,580 --> 03:29:31,440
That guy is not thinking with his heart, too, key.

3391
03:29:33,680 --> 03:29:34,240
Aphrodite.

3392
03:29:34,540 --> 03:29:43,280
Okay, I swear to God if you like, you better not be thinking
with your pee-pee, The woods aren't so my cool.

3393
03:29:44,560 --> 03:29:45,120
Okay.

3394
03:29:49,450 --> 03:29:51,970
Alright, we're...

3395
03:29:53,250 --> 03:29:55,470
Okay, this is strong as hell, though.

3396
03:29:57,150 --> 03:30:00,490
The Zeus food is so good.

3397
03:30:02,350 --> 03:30:02,970
Okay.

3398
03:30:05,970 --> 03:30:07,010
I love the boomerang.

3399
03:30:07,410 --> 03:30:08,030
Boomerang!

3400
03:30:09,110 --> 03:30:11,010
I forgot to gift her.

3401
03:30:11,290 --> 03:30:14,530
I have been around quite a bit longer than appearances
suggest.

3402
03:30:14,710 --> 03:30:15,310
Oh, shit.

3403
03:30:15,790 --> 03:30:17,670
The so-called golden age that Kronos would restore.

3404
03:30:18,370 --> 03:30:19,690
It was the dullest time.

3405
03:30:19,830 --> 03:30:20,750
Like you would not- Hag Friday?

3406
03:30:22,950 --> 03:30:23,530
Alright.

3407
03:30:24,350 --> 03:30:26,190
This special deals more damage for you.

3408
03:30:26,210 --> 03:30:27,890
to nearby foes.

3409
03:30:28,310 --> 03:30:29,130
That doesn't really help.

3410
03:30:29,770 --> 03:30:31,670
And for the rest of this night.

3411
03:30:32,590 --> 03:30:34,050
Rushing damage surrounding foes.

3412
03:30:34,250 --> 03:30:34,490
Wait.

3413
03:30:35,370 --> 03:30:35,650
What?

3414
03:30:35,930 --> 03:30:37,050
I don't know for this.

3415
03:30:38,310 --> 03:30:39,490
Two for a week?

3416
03:30:42,430 --> 03:30:42,930
Hmm.

3417
03:30:46,530 --> 03:30:47,030
Two.

3418
03:30:47,250 --> 03:30:47,570
Okay.

3419
03:30:47,730 --> 03:30:48,670
We'll do more damage.

3420
03:30:49,730 --> 03:30:50,790
Let's just have more damage.

3421
03:30:51,030 --> 03:30:51,890
We'll grab health.

3422
03:30:52,610 --> 03:30:55,590
We don't use magic that much anyway, so it doesn't really
matter for us.

3423
03:30:56,490 --> 03:30:57,590
So on weepers.

3424
03:30:58,390 --> 03:30:59,150
What the?

3425
03:30:59,490 --> 03:31:03,390
Okay, I was gonna say, how the fuck do I am I taking damage
right now?

3426
03:31:04,050 --> 03:31:04,890
This is bullshit.

3427
03:31:06,990 --> 03:31:08,290
This is actually bullshit.

3428
03:31:10,610 --> 03:31:11,970
Alright, that's fine.

3429
03:31:13,010 --> 03:31:13,570
There we go.

3430
03:31:14,630 --> 03:31:15,830
Thank God I got healthier.

3431
03:31:17,110 --> 03:31:24,490
I don't have a lot of money, but I feel like I don't need
mana anyway, so I might as well go to them.

3432
03:31:25,230 --> 03:31:27,670
Uh, might as well buy food, I guess.

3433
03:31:28,770 --> 03:31:29,810
Food time.

3434
03:31:30,990 --> 03:31:31,710
We broke it anyway.

3435
03:31:31,930 --> 03:31:32,690
Alright, another test.

3436
03:31:33,170 --> 03:31:34,330
Apollo's the damn son.

3437
03:31:34,470 --> 03:31:35,710
I don't care how high for the idea.

3438
03:31:35,910 --> 03:31:37,770
She can't beat nuclear fission.

3439
03:31:38,230 --> 03:31:39,130
Loveful of hot.

3440
03:31:39,470 --> 03:31:40,690
Marsha, thank you for the super chat.

3441
03:31:40,890 --> 03:31:40,950
Thank you.

3442
03:31:41,390 --> 03:31:41,670
Thank you.

3443
03:31:42,690 --> 03:31:44,690
Nom, nom, nom.

3444
03:31:48,230 --> 03:31:49,450
Oh, unless Aris...

3445
03:31:49,450 --> 03:31:51,050
Aris is coming back, isn't she?

3446
03:31:51,410 --> 03:31:52,750
Perhaps you do.

3447
03:31:53,830 --> 03:32:02,370
However much I've taught, what's important is your capable I
have to be more than that.

3448
03:32:03,150 --> 03:32:04,450
Oh my god, I fucking hate that.

3449
03:32:12,320 --> 03:32:14,560
Oh my god, there you go.

3450
03:32:18,230 --> 03:32:18,470
Okay.

3451
03:32:23,210 --> 03:32:23,730
For sure.

3452
03:32:23,910 --> 03:32:26,510
Oh, there you go.

3453
03:32:27,010 --> 03:32:27,310
What?

3454
03:32:27,490 --> 03:32:27,830
Okay.

3455
03:32:28,410 --> 03:32:29,070
That's bullshit.

3456
03:32:31,650 --> 03:32:32,250
Okay.

3457
03:32:32,330 --> 03:32:34,290
That's fake, but real one's here.

3458
03:32:37,740 --> 03:32:38,360
Oh, fuck!

3459
03:32:38,480 --> 03:32:39,080
Okay, there you go.

3460
03:32:39,440 --> 03:32:39,760
It's fine.

3461
03:32:42,220 --> 03:32:42,640
Alright.

3462
03:32:44,320 --> 03:32:44,760
No, no, no.

3463
03:32:47,540 --> 03:32:47,840
Okay.

3464
03:32:50,320 --> 03:32:51,240
Okay, how...

3465
03:32:51,240 --> 03:32:52,260
Oh, my God, I made it.

3466
03:32:52,780 --> 03:32:55,880
I was gonna say how many times I have to dodge this.

3467
03:32:57,980 --> 03:32:58,560
What, nice.

3468
03:33:03,160 --> 03:33:04,400
Die every time!

3469
03:33:05,300 --> 03:33:05,860
Every...

3470
03:33:06,220 --> 03:33:06,820
He's tapped.

3471
03:33:10,080 --> 03:33:11,200
Okay, that's fine.

3472
03:33:13,480 --> 03:33:14,100
Yes, we did it!

3473
03:33:14,160 --> 03:33:15,080
Oh, that's fast.

3474
03:33:15,960 --> 03:33:16,200
Oh!

3475
03:33:18,040 --> 03:33:18,940
We did it.

3476
03:33:19,460 --> 03:33:21,220
I dodged her stupid sheep attack.

3477
03:33:24,560 --> 03:33:27,580
Okay, I like the build I have with this weapon.

3478
03:33:27,720 --> 03:33:29,600
I think it's because my weapon is really good for this
build.

3479
03:33:31,680 --> 03:33:32,560
I mean, that's why.

3480
03:33:33,680 --> 03:33:35,480
I have a good, good build right now.

3481
03:33:37,740 --> 03:33:38,260
But...

3482
03:33:38,260 --> 03:33:40,100
I think I definitely need more health.

3483
03:33:40,260 --> 03:33:40,720
Oh hey!

3484
03:33:41,260 --> 03:33:42,000
Don't worry.

3485
03:33:43,100 --> 03:33:43,540
Uh...

3486
03:33:43,540 --> 03:33:44,560
And...

3487
03:33:44,560 --> 03:33:45,260
When shown?

3488
03:33:47,980 --> 03:33:49,020
I'm helping?

3489
03:33:51,060 --> 03:33:51,980
Why don't we try again?

3490
03:33:52,300 --> 03:33:53,280
Okay, wait wait, wait.

3491
03:33:53,340 --> 03:33:53,800
Come join.

3492
03:33:54,540 --> 03:33:55,720
Okay, I got this.

3493
03:33:55,980 --> 03:33:57,020
I'm a little confused.

3494
03:34:01,260 --> 03:34:01,700
Oh, stop!

3495
03:34:01,780 --> 03:34:01,940
Shit!

3496
03:34:02,160 --> 03:34:02,260
I-

3497
03:34:05,890 --> 03:34:07,550
Why I need him?

3498
03:34:07,690 --> 03:34:08,870
Go stay in hell!

3499
03:34:09,030 --> 03:34:11,330
I'll need you

3500
03:34:15,090 --> 03:34:25,610
It said let go left click and I let go right click I don't
need him He doesn't need to be saved Fuck him Guys it's

3501
03:34:25,610 --> 03:34:35,210
because I let go left click I let go right When I told me to
let go left I need his psyche I can get my psyche anywhere

3502
03:34:35,210 --> 03:34:40,070
else As thick I'm a V-Tuber.

3503
03:34:40,210 --> 03:34:42,030
There's plenty of that to go around.

3504
03:34:52,930 --> 03:34:53,790
It's five.

3505
03:34:58,250 --> 03:34:59,230
Okay, here we go.

3506
03:35:01,270 --> 03:35:02,150
We did it.

3507
03:35:03,890 --> 03:35:03,890
Moon.

3508
03:35:04,050 --> 03:35:04,650
We'll get moon.

3509
03:35:04,890 --> 03:35:06,350
We can have extra moon fight battle.

3510
03:35:07,830 --> 03:35:08,990
Actually, I don't know.

3511
03:35:09,030 --> 03:35:18,010
because like the only issue is the fact that like i don't
use a lot of magic so it's gonna force me to use more magic

3512
03:35:18,010 --> 03:35:30,690
there you go selenie selenie come on we have heard nothing
from fleet footed hermes since he told us where did hermes

3513
03:35:30,690 --> 03:35:37,410
go but he's fast and yet hold to faith that some night hence
he shall return to us with news about what else the titan

3514
03:35:37,410 --> 03:35:42,510
chronos has in store I forgot to give her to again.

3515
03:35:43,250 --> 03:35:48,950
The hex makes you rise up and crash down the target area for
grass blasts to large guys.

3516
03:35:49,110 --> 03:35:50,750
I don't have a lot of magic.

3517
03:35:59,780 --> 03:36:00,340
Um...

3518
03:36:01,100 --> 03:36:03,180
I don't think I have...

3519
03:36:03,180 --> 03:36:03,600
One?

3520
03:36:05,060 --> 03:36:05,900
Okay, one.

3521
03:36:07,280 --> 03:36:08,900
I don't have the magic to...

3522
03:36:08,900 --> 03:36:09,540
Oh, I do.

3523
03:36:10,980 --> 03:36:12,100
I don't have the magic to...

3524
03:36:13,080 --> 03:36:13,640
Okay.

3525
03:36:14,720 --> 03:36:16,020
Use one on sirens.

3526
03:36:16,160 --> 03:36:17,040
Oh, that's true.

3527
03:36:17,220 --> 03:36:18,400
I can do that on the sirens.

3528
03:36:24,040 --> 03:36:26,180
Do I want...

3529
03:36:26,180 --> 03:36:27,920
I can't afford anything.

3530
03:36:28,040 --> 03:36:28,880
I don't think I can.

3531
03:36:35,260 --> 03:36:35,560
Okay.

3532
03:36:38,830 --> 03:36:39,890
But I didn't just do this.

3533
03:36:40,770 --> 03:36:41,430
That's right.

3534
03:36:43,930 --> 03:36:44,710
That's why.

3535
03:36:45,790 --> 03:36:47,510
That's why I can't get near me.

3536
03:36:49,450 --> 03:36:50,050
There you go.

3537
03:36:52,590 --> 03:37:00,910

3539
03:37:16,910 --> 03:37:21,330
my close range What's the goddamn vapor?

3540
03:37:22,490 --> 03:37:23,050
Of course.

3541
03:37:23,610 --> 03:37:24,630
It's always the vapor.

3542
03:37:27,390 --> 03:37:29,410
Oh my god, I stood in the vapor again.

3543
03:37:30,150 --> 03:37:31,850
I can't stand in it again.

3544
03:37:32,410 --> 03:37:33,370
Oh my god.

3545
03:37:33,630 --> 03:37:33,830
Wait.

3546
03:37:34,310 --> 03:37:36,250
I keep standing in the vapor.

3547
03:37:37,610 --> 03:37:38,290
I...

3548
03:37:38,290 --> 03:37:39,870
It keeps happening.

3549
03:37:40,550 --> 03:37:41,630
Wait, what is this?

3550
03:37:42,670 --> 03:37:44,150
Is this lore and...

3551
03:37:45,150 --> 03:37:47,310
I can't help it.

3552
03:37:48,650 --> 03:37:49,330
Okay.

3553
03:37:51,790 --> 03:37:53,450
Like, what is this?

3554
03:37:55,350 --> 03:37:57,450
It's a sauna move anywhere.

3555
03:37:57,570 --> 03:37:59,230
No, but there's a thing next to it.

3556
03:37:59,990 --> 03:38:00,510
There's like this.

3557
03:38:04,230 --> 03:38:04,730
Forget.

3558
03:38:05,370 --> 03:38:06,570
It's new encounter?

3559
03:38:07,610 --> 03:38:08,730
Oh, it's a prophecy.

3560
03:38:09,030 --> 03:38:10,730
Okay, we'll try it out.

3561
03:38:12,350 --> 03:38:12,950
Oh shit.

3562
03:38:13,030 --> 03:38:13,990
Oh my god, this is bad.

3563
03:38:14,650 --> 03:38:15,270
This is bad.

3564
03:38:15,610 --> 03:38:16,110
I'm...

3565
03:38:17,450 --> 03:38:18,810
This is so bad.

3566
03:38:24,030 --> 03:38:24,590
Okay.

3567
03:38:26,050 --> 03:38:27,170
Oh my god.

3568
03:38:28,410 --> 03:38:29,210
It's okay.

3569
03:38:31,270 --> 03:38:32,430
Alright, where is he?

3570
03:38:33,470 --> 03:38:34,090
There he is.

3571
03:38:36,110 --> 03:38:36,750
It's fine.

3572
03:38:40,150 --> 03:38:40,970
It's fine.

3573
03:38:42,530 --> 03:38:42,950
There we go.

3574
03:38:43,110 --> 03:38:43,670
We got him.

3575
03:38:44,250 --> 03:38:45,190
In the name of Hades.

3576
03:38:46,050 --> 03:38:47,210
I told you it was fine!

3577
03:38:47,650 --> 03:38:49,190
I keep forgetting to give him stuff.

3578
03:38:50,010 --> 03:38:51,750
Okay, your special inflicts scorch.

3579
03:38:52,270 --> 03:38:52,910
That's good.

3580
03:38:53,190 --> 03:38:55,670
Your cast inflicts scorch on foes.

3581
03:38:56,330 --> 03:38:56,790
Oh, shit.

3582
03:38:57,030 --> 03:38:59,430
Okay, your foes perish in a blast that damage.

3583
03:38:59,810 --> 03:39:00,410
Oh, wait.

3584
03:39:00,630 --> 03:39:01,330
Should I get flash?

3585
03:39:01,590 --> 03:39:02,110
Wait, one.

3586
03:39:02,430 --> 03:39:03,430
Wait, not three?

3587
03:39:07,280 --> 03:39:07,720
Two?

3588
03:39:10,480 --> 03:39:11,520
One or two?

3589
03:39:12,000 --> 03:39:13,040
I use three, two.

3590
03:39:13,140 --> 03:39:14,460
Well, I use scorch a lot.

3591
03:39:14,980 --> 03:39:16,500
I mean, I use the right click a lot.

3592
03:39:19,220 --> 03:39:19,480
Hmm.

3593
03:39:24,560 --> 03:39:25,840
Two is great for bosses.

3594
03:39:26,140 --> 03:39:26,480
I should...

3595
03:39:26,480 --> 03:39:27,480
Oh, that's true.

3596
03:39:28,040 --> 03:39:29,120
I used two for bosses.

3597
03:39:29,360 --> 03:39:30,090
I accept this gift.

3598
03:39:31,400 --> 03:39:31,860
Oh, hey.

3599
03:39:32,440 --> 03:39:33,160
Oh, I forgot to talk.

3600
03:39:33,220 --> 03:39:34,460
There was a glowing thing I didn't see.

3601
03:39:35,820 --> 03:39:36,440
Oh my god.

3602
03:39:37,840 --> 03:39:39,480
Oh my god, my favorite.

3603
03:39:39,780 --> 03:39:46,560
The mirror sheen of the standing waters all about revealed
to denizens of Oceania's their full selves.

3604
03:39:47,340 --> 03:39:47,940
To their horror.

3605
03:39:48,080 --> 03:39:50,720
I mean, I know it's so hard to be this beautiful, man.

3606
03:39:51,100 --> 03:39:52,000
It really is.

3607
03:39:52,940 --> 03:39:56,040
God, what torture to be so handsome.

3608
03:39:56,240 --> 03:39:56,800
Excuse me.

3609
03:39:56,800 --> 03:39:59,220
All right, let's gift him next day.

3610
03:39:59,400 --> 03:39:59,600
Of course.

3611
03:39:59,800 --> 03:40:00,240
He's the one.

3612
03:40:00,440 --> 03:40:09,880
Yes, this is the one I remember the gift guys I just relate
to him so much just as a casual acquaintance to be clear I

3613
03:40:09,880 --> 03:40:15,440
like how it's like I'm just doing it as we're not friends by
the way, but here's a gift You give me such tokens of

3614
03:40:15,440 --> 03:40:16,800
affection full knowing.

3615
03:40:16,880 --> 03:40:20,960
I've already got a lot of them and more importantly I'm
spoken for bro.

3616
03:40:21,160 --> 03:40:22,320
You're you're not single?

3617
03:40:23,940 --> 03:40:26,780
Who can love you as much as you can love yourself?

3618
03:40:28,440 --> 03:40:28,820
Nice.

3619
03:40:29,320 --> 03:40:31,220
How could I ever forget you, Narcissus?

3620
03:40:32,940 --> 03:40:33,580
I know, right?

3621
03:40:33,660 --> 03:40:34,740
He's so unforgettable.

3622
03:40:35,440 --> 03:40:39,280
Whoever you are, at least you've got more guts than all my
other would-be suitors back there.

3623
03:40:39,780 --> 03:40:40,880
Though you still don't have a chance.

3624
03:40:40,920 --> 03:40:42,900
He is taken by himself.

3625
03:40:43,400 --> 03:40:45,920
I know, I was like, who would love you more than yourself?

3626
03:40:46,660 --> 03:40:49,880
This truth must have felt strongly for you in life if
they've been lingering nearby.

3627
03:40:50,520 --> 03:40:52,060
But it wasn't my intent to be out of town.

3628
03:40:52,540 --> 03:40:54,340
Meany to thank you for your gift the other night.

3629
03:40:56,800 --> 03:41:03,920
I know every opening line there is and merely to thank you
is one of the classics acting all to mirror Well, I know

3630
03:41:03,920 --> 03:41:06,700
what you really want and you're not getting it.

3631

03:42:25,940 --> 03:42:26,960
What have you decided?

3638
03:42:28,180 --> 03:42:28,900
Bite Medi.

03:42:41,540 --> 03:42:43,020
God, I hate these guys the most.

3647
03:42:44,440 --> 03:42:44,540
All right.

3648
03:42:45,780 --> 03:42:47,000
Get rid of him.

3652
03:43:19,880 --> 03:43:21,600
I guess his power-ups are really good.

3653
03:43:22,420 --> 03:43:23,100
Okay, I gifted.

3654
03:43:23,300 --> 03:43:24,340
This time I remember, Chad.

3655
03:43:24,480 --> 03:43:25,680
I remember this time.

3656
03:43:25,740 --> 03:43:26,200
You might have, Uncle Zeus.

3657
03:43:26,480 --> 03:43:27,580
Vanquisher of Titans.

3658
03:43:28,340 --> 03:43:30,420
Your strength has saved our family before.

3659
03:43:31,080 --> 03:43:33,200
You're most kind to now share some of it with me.

3660
03:43:33,840 --> 03:43:34,520
I did it, guys.

3661
03:43:34,600 --> 03:43:35,080
I remembered.

3662
03:43:36,500 --> 03:43:37,080
Alright, Uncle.

3663
03:43:39,140 --> 03:43:40,960
Oh, my God.

3664
03:43:41,020 --> 03:43:43,760
He's back after being the...

3665
03:43:44,300 --> 03:43:45,600
His hundredth women.

3666
03:43:48,120 --> 03:43:50,440
He actually has time for me.

3667
03:43:52,020 --> 03:43:52,860
Yeah, thank you, uncle.

3668
03:43:59,120 --> 03:44:03,020
Your foe is struck by, and again, 50% of the time.

3669
03:44:03,320 --> 03:44:07,340
Damage from Moons immediately activates Blitz and makes them
stronger.

3670
03:44:09,280 --> 03:44:09,520
Oh!

3671
03:44:11,940 --> 03:44:14,160
Your special inflicts Blitz.

3672
03:44:15,600 --> 03:44:17,700
I feel like two or three is better, isn't it?

3673
03:44:18,860 --> 03:44:19,620
Sorry, not hundreds.

3674
03:44:19,860 --> 03:44:22,240
I'm sorry, I meant that's me low-balling it.

3675
03:44:22,400 --> 03:44:23,340
A thousand and...

3676
03:44:23,340 --> 03:44:24,560
There's a thousand women.

3677
03:44:29,860 --> 03:44:31,300
Uh, only women.

3678
03:44:31,580 --> 03:44:35,640
Sorry, a thousandth, one thousandth women and the three
thousandth men.

3679
03:44:36,100 --> 03:44:37,900
Because we were in those times.

3680
03:44:40,080 --> 03:44:42,140
We heard about the saunas, guys.

3681
03:44:42,540 --> 03:44:42,880
All right.

3682
03:44:47,160 --> 03:44:51,020
Oh, and then the 50th animal.

3683
03:44:53,380 --> 03:44:56,700
I heard about the bathhouses, guys, back then.

3684
03:45:02,380 --> 03:45:03,000
Uh...

3685
03:45:03,000 --> 03:45:04,160
We're like three.

3686
03:45:04,400 --> 03:45:05,160
Yeah, let's do three.

3687
03:45:05,960 --> 03:45:06,880
Just for the boss.

3688
03:45:07,520 --> 03:45:08,660
The ante is back!

3689
03:45:09,040 --> 03:45:10,440
You thought you could...

3690
03:45:11,160 --> 03:45:12,360
I'm gonna...

3691
03:45:12,360 --> 03:45:14,260
Guys, I'm canceling the third concert.

3692
03:45:14,400 --> 03:45:14,980
Let's go.

3693
03:45:17,580 --> 03:45:18,900
Now we're ready.

3694
03:45:20,080 --> 03:45:21,700
How did you like our latest song, lady?

3695
03:45:21,820 --> 03:45:23,900
Oh, did it not do the dialogue again?

3696
03:45:26,320 --> 03:45:27,240
That's right.

3697
03:45:27,500 --> 03:45:29,880
I'm here to cancel the third concert.

3698
03:45:32,720 --> 03:45:34,400
If you seek feed...

3699
03:45:34,400 --> 03:45:36,060
Okay, I think it didn't work again.

3700
03:45:40,550 --> 03:45:41,310
That's right.

3701
03:45:41,630 --> 03:45:44,610
I'm going to make sure none of you guys can watch the
concert.

3702
03:45:44,830 --> 03:45:45,550
The course was catchy enough.

3703
03:45:45,950 --> 03:45:48,110
But the lyrics and their disturbing themes were rather
disturbing.

3704
03:45:49,790 --> 03:45:50,390
distracting.

3705
03:46:02,250 --> 03:46:05,570
I'll never let their fans hear the end of the song.

3706
03:46:08,940 --> 03:46:09,720
That's right.

3707
03:46:10,240 --> 03:46:12,860
You'll never get to hear the end of her song.

3708
03:46:15,560 --> 03:46:16,340
That's right.

3709
03:46:16,960 --> 03:46:17,560
No more

3710
03:46:23,240 --> 03:46:24,300
music.

3711
03:46:24,300 --> 03:46:24,800
That's right.

3712
03:46:25,280 --> 03:46:26,740
rhythm for you, girl!

3713
03:46:35,210 --> 03:46:36,370
Oh, shit!

3714
03:46:40,240 --> 03:46:40,600
Oh.

3715
03:46:45,460 --> 03:46:46,140
Alright.

3716
03:46:46,920 --> 03:46:48,120
Gotta get rid of the rhythm.

3717
03:46:50,500 --> 03:46:51,780
Oh, shit!

3718
03:46:56,480 --> 03:46:58,220
Oh, are you serious?

3719
03:46:58,360 --> 03:46:58,760
No!

3720
03:46:59,100 --> 03:47:00,120
Death Defiance!

3721
03:47:01,500 --> 03:47:04,020
Okay, I was so cocky there.

3722
03:47:04,500 --> 03:47:05,460
I fucked up.

3723
03:47:06,420 --> 03:47:07,560
It's so hard to see.

3724
03:47:15,790 --> 03:47:17,250
Oh my god, it's so hard.

3725
03:47:17,470 --> 03:47:18,030
It's so clever.

3726
03:47:18,110 --> 03:47:19,410
There's so much clever, though.

3727
03:47:19,830 --> 03:47:22,970
Oh no.

3728
03:47:27,100 --> 03:47:27,460
Oh no.

3729
03:47:27,600 --> 03:47:28,600
I might have to accidentally.

3730
03:47:29,380 --> 03:47:30,160
She just...

3731
03:47:30,160 --> 03:47:31,800
She's so hard for...

3732
03:47:35,080 --> 03:47:37,800
This is not the best for...

3733
03:47:42,580 --> 03:47:43,040
My...

3734
03:47:43,040 --> 03:47:43,540
Yes!

3735
03:47:43,940 --> 03:47:44,360
Oh!

3736
03:47:47,520 --> 03:47:48,420
That's okay.

3737
03:47:48,660 --> 03:47:50,460
I lost the depth of fives, but that's okay.

3738
03:47:50,620 --> 03:47:51,780
I canceled another concert.

3739
03:47:52,320 --> 03:47:54,540
You'll never get a concert, dragons.

3740
03:47:55,860 --> 03:47:57,500
The anties shall win.

3741
03:47:59,580 --> 03:48:02,320
I'll never give you guys another concert.

3742
03:48:06,020 --> 03:48:06,860
And down I go.

3743
03:48:07,700 --> 03:48:09,560
The power of the anties.

3744
03:48:15,780 --> 03:48:17,380
Eris's back isn't she?

3745
03:48:17,720 --> 03:48:19,220
It's dry a hair at least.

3746
03:48:20,180 --> 03:48:30,860
she's back oh my god why when does it stop when does she
stop don't be wasting any further breath on you while you

3747
03:48:30,860 --> 03:48:39,480

fine you don't have to just remember that I'm doing this for

3748
03:48:39,480 --> 03:48:43,580
your own good what do you mean for my own good I almost
fucking saved the world.

3749
03:48:45,080 --> 03:48:45,700
See you later.

3750
03:48:46,260 --> 03:48:47,460
Oh my god.

3751
03:48:47,520 --> 03:48:48,880
I'm trying to slow you down.

3752
03:48:50,080 --> 03:48:51,200
Blessed again.

3753
03:48:51,520 --> 03:48:51,740
Alright.

3754
03:48:52,520 --> 03:48:53,620
Is it the same curse?

3755
03:48:53,700 --> 03:48:55,220
It's always this curse, isn't it?

3756
03:48:55,520 --> 03:48:56,720
It'll never be different.

3757
03:49:04,740 --> 03:49:06,940
Let's just go straight into it.

3758
03:49:12,600 --> 03:49:13,820
Oh my god, I can't see shit.

3759
03:49:18,730 --> 03:49:19,370
Oh my, there she is.

3760

3763
03:49:48,950 --> 03:49:54,210
uh yeah it's so hard to see the attacks because my cast is
also red.

3764
03:49:56,650 --> 03:49:56,950
Alright.

3765
03:49:57,310 --> 03:49:57,630
Alright.

3766
03:49:58,170 --> 03:50:00,250
So it's like, I'm not sure if I like it.

3767
03:50:00,610 --> 03:50:02,710
I mean, I actually no, I don't like it.

3768
03:50:04,410 --> 03:50:04,890
You know, fuck it.

3769
03:50:04,890 --> 03:50:05,930
I actually don't like it.

3770
03:50:08,450 --> 03:50:09,950
I literally can't see shit.

3771
03:50:20,540 --> 03:50:23,480
I'm gonna do this for now, because I don't want to get
close.

3772
03:50:26,940 --> 03:50:27,560
Alright, nice.

3773
03:50:29,020 --> 03:50:29,160
Alright, nice.

3774
03:50:29,180 --> 03:50:30,220
in the name of Hades.

3775
03:50:31,020 --> 03:50:32,320
Yeah, my two ranked up.

3776
03:50:34,300 --> 03:50:36,600
Your chain lane deals more damages and bounces up.

3777
03:50:36,860 --> 03:50:40,400
Whatever you use this, I should get electric overload.

3778
03:50:41,000 --> 03:50:41,280
Yeah.

3779
03:50:42,720 --> 03:50:43,480
My special.

3780
03:50:43,660 --> 03:50:45,000
I feel like I should get two, right?

3781
03:50:46,180 --> 03:50:46,660
Yeah.

3782
03:50:48,400 --> 03:50:49,620
I can get out now.

3783
03:50:50,100 --> 03:50:51,960
Yeah, no, I'm not going to fight that boss.

3784
03:50:55,480 --> 03:50:55,960
Yeah.

3785

3793
03:51:45,200 --> 03:51:46,780

Oh, wait.

03:51:50,500 --> 03:51:53,240
Wait, your attacks deal on your striking.

3799
03:51:53,400 --> 03:51:54,440
Okay, from behind.

3800
03:51:54,540 --> 03:51:55,400
Okay, I feel like one.

3801
03:51:56,020 --> 03:51:57,460
Yeah, one for the armor.

3802
03:51:57,840 --> 03:51:58,940
Armor seems good.

3803
03:52:01,400 --> 03:52:01,880
Wait.

3804
03:52:04,760 --> 03:52:06,140
Because I don't know about...

3805
03:52:06,140 --> 03:52:07,980
Oh god, okay, not you.

3806
03:52:09,260 --> 03:52:10,120
Not you.

3807
03:52:13,920 --> 03:52:15,020
God damn it.

3808
03:52:16,420 --> 03:52:17,960
That's why you can't get me!

3809
03:52:21,380 --> 03:52:22,100
No, fuck it.

3810
03:52:22,680 --> 03:52:23,420
There we go.

3811
03:52:24,780 --> 03:52:25,040

03:52:26,740 --> 03:52:27,380
Uh, oh.

3813
03:52:28,600 --> 03:52:29,420
Is it Echo?

3814
03:52:30,340 --> 03:52:30,840
That's Echo.

3815
03:52:31,020 --> 03:52:32,380

3820
03:53:04,800 --> 03:53:06,580
She finally responds.

3821
03:53:08,140 --> 03:53:08,380
Okay.

3822
03:53:09,680 --> 03:53:13,420
From the previous night, manifest a copy of your most
recently claimed rewards.

3823
03:53:13,720 --> 03:53:14,560
God damn it.

3824
03:53:14,800 --> 03:53:17,340
If I knew I wouldn't have got the coins first.

3825
03:53:18,440 --> 03:53:20,040
Being 50% dodge chance.

3826
03:53:20,300 --> 03:53:20,560
Okay.

3827
03:53:21,960 --> 03:53:22,860

3828
03:53:22,860 --> 03:53:23,220
Yeah.

3829
03:53:23,480 --> 03:53:25,040
I should get boon, boon, boon, right?

3830
03:53:28,660 --> 03:53:29,180
Three?

3831
03:53:29,700 --> 03:53:30,360
A dodge?

3832
03:53:32,100 --> 03:53:33,260
No, I'm gonna...

3833
03:53:33,260 --> 03:53:33,560
I'm gonna...

3834
03:53:33,580 --> 03:53:36,600
I feel like I'll spam the dodge and use it up in, like, two
rooms.

3835
03:53:36,700 --> 03:53:37,220
Be strong.

3836
03:53:37,840 --> 03:53:38,440
What do I get?

3837
03:53:39,780 --> 03:53:43,620
Your attacks gain power, but you prime 20.

3838
03:53:44,080 --> 03:53:48,080
Whenever you clear enough encounters, a random wound, you
have gained rarity.

3839
03:53:48,740 --> 03:53:48,940
Oh.

3840
03:53:51,900 --> 03:53:52,380
Wait.

3841
03:53:52,880 --> 03:53:53,780
Your special deals.

3842
03:53:54,000 --> 03:53:54,320
Oh.

3843
03:53:55,000 --> 03:53:55,480
One.

3844
03:53:55,620 --> 03:53:55,900
Freeze.

3845
03:53:56,160 --> 03:53:56,400
Yeah.

3846
03:53:56,740 --> 03:53:58,220
I use one a lot, too.

3847
03:53:58,660 --> 03:53:59,300
Okay, now again.

3848
03:54:00,620 --> 03:54:03,560
Even in a place of sorrow such as this, there's beauty.

3849
03:54:07,840 --> 03:54:09,700
Yeah, don't worry.

3850
03:54:09,900 --> 03:54:12,740
I'll throw money at you, and then you'll be happier, right?

3851
03:54:13,260 --> 03:54:14,300
Perhaps this will help.

3852
03:54:15,680 --> 03:54:16,180
Here you go.

3853
03:54:18,260 --> 03:54:18,760
Pick a gift.

3854
03:54:19,120 --> 03:54:19,700
What do I get?

3855
03:54:20,520 --> 03:54:21,320
Concave stone.

3856
03:54:21,480 --> 03:54:22,040
It's an honor.

3857
03:54:23,120 --> 03:54:23,320
Yay!

3858
03:54:24,080 --> 03:54:25,740
I got a stone from her body.

3859
03:54:25,940 --> 03:54:28,020
She gave a piece of her body to me, guys.

3860
03:54:28,340 --> 03:54:28,440
Jealous?

3861
03:54:29,420 --> 03:54:30,960
Ha ha ha.

3862
03:54:34,440 --> 03:54:34,960
Yeah.

3863
03:54:36,200 --> 03:54:37,800
Yeah, we'll grab this.

3864
03:54:39,380 --> 03:54:40,160
Dodge is not dashed.

3865
03:54:40,220 --> 03:54:40,660
Oh, okay.

3866
03:54:40,760 --> 03:54:41,440
That's good to know.

3867
03:54:42,200 --> 03:54:43,660
That's actually really good to know.

3868
03:54:46,260 --> 03:54:47,080
All right.

3869
03:54:52,100 --> 03:54:52,880
That's right.

3870
03:54:53,380 --> 03:54:54,880
She gave it to me.

3871
03:54:55,580 --> 03:54:55,860
Ooh.

3872
03:54:56,480 --> 03:54:58,240
She picked me to hack.

3873
03:54:58,320 --> 03:54:58,960
Oh, shit.

3874
03:54:59,340 --> 03:55:00,260
What the fuck?

3875
03:55:00,660 --> 03:55:01,740
Who was through that?

3876
03:55:05,720 --> 03:55:09,900
Jesus Christ Okay, who keeps throwing that?

3877
03:55:10,120 --> 03:55:15,520
That's not cool Oh, it's these things

3878
03:55:19,450 --> 03:55:29,650
Okay, nice Okay, I have to destroy these Wait, I can't
destroy it Oh, that's fucked I don't like that

3879
03:55:33,830 --> 03:55:35,730
Okay, I think I can kill these guys now.

3880
03:55:36,730 --> 03:55:36,730
Nice.

3881
03:55:38,410 --> 03:55:41,090
Okay, I should be able to do the magic stuff for this now.

3882
03:55:43,370 --> 03:55:43,950
Okay.

3883
03:55:46,970 --> 03:55:47,650
Alright.

3884
03:55:50,900 --> 03:55:51,760
Oh my god.

3885
03:55:52,600 --> 03:55:53,100
Alright, nice.

3886
03:55:56,600 --> 03:55:57,900
Jesus Christ!

3887
03:55:58,900 --> 03:55:59,400
Boom!

3888
03:56:03,580 --> 03:56:05,360
Okay, wait, I can kill this wolf.

3889
03:56:06,840 --> 03:56:07,500
Nice.

3890
03:56:08,280 --> 03:56:08,960
Nice.

3891
03:56:10,780 --> 03:56:13,380
All right, gift, here's a nectar.

3892
03:56:14,260 --> 03:56:14,980
Great Aphrodite.

3893
03:56:15,960 --> 03:56:18,980
You must get more offerings than all the other gods and
goddesses combined.

3894
03:56:19,760 --> 03:56:21,040
Though this one comes from me.

3895
03:56:22,900 --> 03:56:23,180
Yeah.

3896
03:56:26,200 --> 03:56:28,860
I feel like I gave so many gifts today.

3897
03:56:29,180 --> 03:56:30,480
I must return the gesture.

3898
03:56:30,880 --> 03:56:31,220
So please.

3899
03:56:31,420 --> 03:56:33,900
I'm in means I'm so lucky with all my runs lately.

3900
03:56:36,140 --> 03:56:40,000
Like if Ares didn't fuck me over, I think I wouldn't be in
this game by the way.

3901
03:56:40,020 --> 03:56:40,600
I know.

3902
03:56:41,780 --> 03:56:46,940
I actually think if Ares didn't exist, I would have fucking
beaten the game.

3903
03:56:47,360 --> 03:56:48,720
Ooh, it's flipping over.

3904
03:56:48,820 --> 03:56:50,760
Don't just take my word for it, gorgeous.

3905
03:56:51,240 --> 03:56:53,320
Your wise and even-handed uncle.

3906
03:56:53,820 --> 03:56:54,000
Oh.

3907
03:56:54,790 --> 03:56:55,760
Wait, which one?

3908
03:56:56,500 --> 03:56:58,060
Wait a minute, which uncle?

3909
03:56:58,780 --> 03:57:01,200
The thing is, this does not narrow it down.

3910
03:57:01,500 --> 03:57:03,140
Aphrodite fucked everything, too.

3911
03:57:03,880 --> 03:57:05,540
She was literally the goddess of love.

3912
03:57:05,860 --> 03:57:07,100
Oh, oh, okay.

3913
03:57:07,280 --> 03:57:09,920
This is based on love of family and of mortal kind.

3914
03:57:11,620 --> 03:57:15,360
Wait, I'm going to talk to him later, too.

3915
03:57:17,700 --> 03:57:18,380
Oh, shit.

3916
03:57:20,840 --> 03:57:24,000
Okay, rushing into foes with Blitz immediately activates the
effect.

3917
03:57:24,260 --> 03:57:24,740
Oh, nice.

3918
03:57:25,640 --> 03:57:26,480
Romantic spark.

3919
03:57:28,040 --> 03:57:29,060
Uh, all right.

3920
03:57:29,200 --> 03:57:29,580
That's cool.

3921
03:57:29,680 --> 03:57:30,980
I'm going to talk to him later, too.

3922
03:57:37,220 --> 03:57:38,360
All right, there he is as well.

3923
03:57:39,320 --> 03:57:39,880
That's awkward.

3924
03:57:43,890 --> 03:57:44,870
Yes, another duel.

3925
03:57:45,250 --> 03:57:45,570
though.

3926
03:57:51,450 --> 03:57:51,990
Oh my god.

3927
03:57:52,410 --> 03:57:53,310
Oh my god.

3928
03:57:53,490 --> 03:57:54,550
He did so much.

3929
03:57:59,310 --> 03:58:00,390
Jesus Christ.

3930
03:58:00,710 --> 03:58:01,030
Fuck it.

3931
03:58:01,050 --> 03:58:02,230
I don't know who is going to summon.

3932
03:58:02,870 --> 03:58:03,730
I'll take it.

3933
03:58:03,730 --> 03:58:03,730
Whatever.

3934
03:58:04,150 --> 03:58:05,230
Oh my.

3935
03:58:05,830 --> 03:58:05,830
Whatever.

3936
03:58:06,710 --> 03:58:06,710
Whatever.

3937
03:58:07,850 --> 03:58:08,350
I have.

3938
03:58:08,450 --> 03:58:09,790
It took so much damage.

3939
03:58:10,090 --> 03:58:10,930
So I'll take it.

3940
03:58:11,630 --> 03:58:13,950
I'll just summon it just for the sake of it.

3941
03:58:16,610 --> 03:58:17,710
In the name of Hades.

3942
03:58:18,630 --> 03:58:19,730
Yeah, he definitely has...

3943
03:58:19,730 --> 03:58:19,930
Oh!

3944
03:58:20,630 --> 03:58:21,590
Another duel?

3945
03:58:23,710 --> 03:58:25,690
Also cost his lightning balls to be refit.

3946
03:58:25,850 --> 03:58:26,670
Oh, shit!

3947
03:58:27,430 --> 03:58:28,330
Let's go!

3948
03:58:33,490 --> 03:58:34,450
Double duos!

3949
03:58:35,150 --> 03:58:36,370
Okay, I have a lot of money.

3950
03:58:36,490 --> 03:58:37,130
See, I can do this.

3951
03:58:37,390 --> 03:58:37,650
That's my way.

3952
03:58:40,030 --> 03:58:42,370
My mom gives you two duos!

3953
03:58:44,490 --> 03:58:45,710
Okay, let's grab...

3954
03:58:45,710 --> 03:58:46,470
I have so much money.

3955
03:58:46,530 --> 03:58:47,310
I'll grab food first.

3956
03:58:47,450 --> 03:58:49,570
Because I need this.

3957
03:58:50,610 --> 03:58:51,230
Another duel!

3958
03:58:51,250 --> 03:58:51,730
duo?

3959
03:58:55,600 --> 03:58:56,060
What?

3960
03:58:56,840 --> 03:58:57,900
Feels damaged faster.

3961
03:58:58,040 --> 03:58:58,400
Oh, shit.

3962
03:58:58,560 --> 03:58:59,420
Guys, which one do we want?

3963
03:59:00,280 --> 03:59:01,600
The duo or the epic?

3964
03:59:04,240 --> 03:59:06,720
I got three duos in a row.

3965
03:59:07,180 --> 03:59:10,780
I got so many duos that they stopped talking to me.

3966
03:59:13,020 --> 03:59:14,000
That's crazy.

3967
03:59:14,260 --> 03:59:16,100
They stopped talking to me.

3968
03:59:21,000 --> 03:59:21,300
Alright.

3969
03:59:21,960 --> 03:59:22,760
They want...

3970
03:59:22,760 --> 03:59:24,140
I don't giving you another one.

3971
03:59:24,880 --> 03:59:25,480
Yo, dog.

3972
03:59:25,620 --> 03:59:26,980
I heard you like duos.

3973
03:59:29,000 --> 03:59:30,060
Wait, he's evil again?

3974
03:59:30,360 --> 03:59:31,680
But I thought I saved you.

3975
03:59:31,780 --> 03:59:32,900
Call me yourself, Severus.

3976
03:59:33,240 --> 03:59:33,980
We're going to fix this.

3977
03:59:35,060 --> 03:59:37,020
Yeah, I thought I saved you already.

3978
03:59:38,260 --> 03:59:38,780
Oh my god.

3979
03:59:39,740 --> 03:59:41,500
Oh my god, 39.

3980
03:59:45,740 --> 03:59:47,600
Are you fucking kidding me?

3981
03:59:49,500 --> 03:59:51,080
Are you fucking kidding me?

3982
03:59:51,160 --> 03:59:52,540
Oh my god, I hate this.

3983
03:59:56,920 --> 03:59:57,680
No,

3984
04:00:00,830 --> 04:00:01,670
fuck this.

3985
04:00:02,890 --> 04:00:04,050
I fuck this.

3986
04:00:08,640 --> 04:00:09,760
I hate you, Aeris.

3987
04:00:10,440 --> 04:00:11,960
I fucking hate you.

3988
04:00:12,920 --> 04:00:13,800
I hate you.

3989
04:00:13,940 --> 04:00:15,060
Why are you harder?

3990
04:00:16,800 --> 04:00:19,260
Wait, why is he harder?

3991
04:00:23,180 --> 04:00:24,440
Wait a minute.

3992
04:00:24,880 --> 04:00:25,860
Why is he harder?

3993
04:00:29,970 --> 04:00:31,570
Return to shadow now.

3994
04:00:39,570 --> 04:00:41,810
is that singing

3995
04:00:52,760 --> 04:01:02,540
when does eris leave when does or how can i kill her i've
heard our old song in a while have you i'll enjoy it while

3996
04:01:02,540 --> 04:01:10,840
she's here how do i kill the witch i'll start brooding I'm
brooding right now.

3997
04:01:11,040 --> 04:01:12,500
And you'll have so much to talk about.

3998
04:01:13,480 --> 04:01:14,820
That the longing for them spur you on.

3999
04:01:15,300 --> 04:01:16,460
Eris did this to me.

4000
04:01:16,480 --> 04:01:17,380
Tad runs!

4001
04:01:18,020 --> 04:01:18,640
That whore.

4002
04:01:19,360 --> 04:01:20,660
That fucking whore.

4003
04:01:20,860 --> 04:01:23,760
What you say is the most frightening thing you've
encountered out there lately, Mel?

4004
04:01:24,260 --> 04:01:28,540
It's important for someone in my position to keep up with
the latest on this front.

4005
04:01:32,620 --> 04:01:37,880
Well, I'd have to go with the raging infernal beast guarding
the only viable way into Tartarus.

4006
04:01:38,600 --> 04:01:39,640
Absolutely massive.

4007
04:01:39,900 --> 04:01:40,960
Countless sharp fangs.

4008
04:01:41,340 --> 04:01:42,760
Three fire-spitting moors.

4009
04:01:43,940 --> 04:01:45,100
Though he's also my family's dog.

4010
04:01:45,240 --> 04:01:47,320
How did he get fucking infected again?

4011
04:01:47,440 --> 04:01:48,820
I thought I saved him.

4012
04:01:49,000 --> 04:01:49,520
How did you get me going?

4013
04:01:50,240 --> 04:01:55,560
Well, if you're telling me there's nothing scarier out there
than a pet dog, it means I've got no competition.

4014
04:01:56,240 --> 04:01:57,060
Time to rest on this.

4015
04:01:57,120 --> 04:02:00,580
God, if you're listening, please kill Aris Parker.

4016
04:02:00,940 --> 04:02:02,560
Many thank you for the super chat.

4017
04:02:02,720 --> 04:02:03,940
Thank you, thank you.

4018
04:02:06,260 --> 04:02:07,800
Please make yourself comfortable.

4019
04:02:08,500 --> 04:02:09,560
All that you see is me.

4020
04:02:12,460 --> 04:02:23,760
i have to find lord morose once again and call him here i'm
so sad because like okay because like i had the best i had

04:02:45,820 --> 04:02:46,900
That's a good start.

4024
04:02:48,300 --> 04:02:51,840
Hey, since you're here, why not lend me your voice for all
time's sake?

4025
04:02:52,560 --> 04:02:53,760
Let go your burdens for a bit.

4026
04:02:55,260 --> 04:02:56,640
I'll sing with her.

4027
04:02:59,500 --> 04:03:01,340
La la la.

4028
04:03:01,620 --> 04:03:01,920
That's it.

4029
04:03:03,520 --> 04:03:04,040
La.

4030
04:03:06,080 --> 04:03:07,600

4033
04:03:36,520 --> 04:03:40,100
press on recipes for aglass and which resources you need.

4034
04:03:40,140 --> 04:03:41,320
I don't think I need that.

4035
04:03:42,220 --> 04:03:42,600
That's good.

4036
04:03:42,820 --> 04:03:43,100
That's good.

4037
04:03:43,320 --> 04:03:43,840
Sounds been good.

4038
04:03:44,740 --> 04:03:47,640
Gives her each night to have free thirst yielding.

4039
04:03:50,060 --> 04:03:56,460
Okay, what else do I mean?

4040
04:04:01,220 --> 04:04:04,700
Oh, I don't have materials now.

4041
04:04:05,960 --> 04:04:08,640
I mean, I might as well just build this just because I can.

4042
04:04:08,640 --> 04:04:12,960
all right

4043
04:04:17,310 --> 04:04:26,230

resources okay hello sharon

4045
04:04:40,310 --> 04:04:47,810
voyages across the realms wherever he may be used to be the
fastest god alive.

4046
04:04:48,510 --> 04:04:50,010
How could he just be disappear?

4047
04:04:50,430 --> 04:04:51,590
Thank you for the supplies, my lord.

4048
04:04:51,730 --> 04:04:51,990
Yay.

4049
04:04:52,750 --> 04:04:53,610
More supplies.

4050
04:04:53,870 --> 04:04:54,810
Let's go.

4051
04:04:57,690 --> 04:04:58,790
Oh yeah, what were you doing?

4052
04:04:59,110 --> 04:04:59,390
Huh?

4053
04:05:00,090 --> 04:05:01,490
You just stood there.

4054
04:05:02,950 --> 04:05:04,750
Why aren't you there distracting Eris?

4055
04:05:05,770 --> 04:05:06,690
Isn't personal.

4056
04:05:07,810 --> 04:05:10,110
You don't see my mother around either, do you, Nem?

4057
04:05:10,790 --> 04:05:11,650
They got him.

4058
04:05:11,930 --> 04:05:12,110
What?

4059
04:05:12,250 --> 04:05:13,430
Yeah, they just got him.

4060
04:05:13,650 --> 04:05:14,830
Kronos took them all.

4061
04:05:16,030 --> 04:05:17,610
Bro, she's my auntie.

4062
04:05:17,710 --> 04:05:18,430
My mother too.

4063
04:05:19,130 --> 04:05:19,990
And I knew mine.

4064
04:05:20,930 --> 04:05:21,970
What's yours to you?

4065
04:05:22,650 --> 04:05:24,870
All you ever did was fall out of her womb.

4066
04:05:24,950 --> 04:05:25,830
What did you do?

4067
04:05:27,790 --> 04:05:29,870
Bro, she's such an auntie.

4068
04:05:31,770 --> 04:05:32,970
I still don't have...

4069
04:05:32,970 --> 04:05:35,130
I'm still trying to save up for...

4070
04:05:35,130 --> 04:05:36,710
I mean, I have a lot of bones.

4071
04:05:36,850 --> 04:05:39,030
I might as well just buy Psyche and this.

4072
04:05:40,150 --> 04:05:41,110
The crossroads.

4073
04:05:41,790 --> 04:05:44,730
That haven hidden twigs the surface and the underworld.

4074
04:05:45,110 --> 04:05:45,530
You mean they got him.

4075
04:05:47,250 --> 04:05:51,650
See, she hates me, and then I hate the Sirens.

4076
04:05:51,830 --> 04:05:52,890
It's like a circle of hate.

4077
04:05:53,790 --> 04:05:55,070
I'll never stop the cycle.

4078
04:05:56,450 --> 04:05:57,970
Together we'll retake my father's role.

4079
04:05:58,190 --> 04:06:00,290
I once was desperate to hear the Sirens' song.

4080
04:06:01,390 --> 04:06:03,270
I barely resisted their temptations.

4081
04:06:03,690 --> 04:06:05,730
Of course, I was merely mortal.

4082
04:06:06,370 --> 04:06:08,490
Perhaps you're less susceptible to their allure.

4083
04:06:10,290 --> 04:06:12,270
Yeah, I've ruined three concerts already.

4084
04:06:12,530 --> 04:06:13,630
I failed to see the appeal.

4085
04:06:14,250 --> 04:06:15,970
Although it's possible the Sirens were better off.

4086
04:06:15,990 --> 04:06:23,090
without skiller she seems rather bossy yeah they don't need
her she's a menace caught half a dozen of my crew like she'd

4087
04:06:23,090 --> 04:06:29,910
a separate set of teeth for each of the poor lads we'd
little choice but to pray to the gods and sail on tell her

4088
04:06:29,910 --> 04:06:40,390
hello for me did the gods answer your call at least yeah did
she or did they for the most part i mean you're dead so i

4089
04:06:40,390 --> 04:06:42,690
don't know he's dead

4090
04:06:46,550 --> 04:06:47,870
Oh, let's plant too.

4091
04:06:48,910 --> 04:06:49,550
Oh, no.

4092
04:06:53,310 --> 04:06:54,990
Alright, let's plant this.

4093
04:06:55,370 --> 04:06:57,050
Oh, I can.

4094
04:06:57,690 --> 04:06:59,330
I see it now.

4095
04:07:01,030 --> 04:07:01,670
Can't upgrade?

4096
04:07:01,850 --> 04:07:02,430
No, I can't.

4097
04:07:02,510 --> 04:07:02,710
Okay.

4098
04:07:03,590 --> 04:07:04,710
Restore every...

4099
04:07:04,710 --> 04:07:07,850
Your sprint is 5% lets you pass through most foes.

4100
04:07:08,550 --> 04:07:10,030
You have 200 coins.

4101
04:07:13,150 --> 04:07:13,770
0.8.

4102
04:07:13,790 --> 04:07:15,910
I feel like everything moving slower would be better.

4103
04:07:17,450 --> 04:07:21,450
Your hex also charges up automatically as you used...

4104
04:07:21,970 --> 04:07:22,510
Okay.

4105
04:07:25,790 --> 04:07:26,950
Centaur is good?

4106
04:07:29,290 --> 04:07:31,930
You gain when you pass through...

4107
04:07:31,930 --> 04:07:32,310
Oh!

4108
04:07:35,450 --> 04:07:37,070
We'll get that later.

4109
04:07:38,050 --> 04:07:40,890
Swift is good for early runs?

4110
04:07:42,050 --> 04:07:42,610
What's Swift?

4111
04:07:43,190 --> 04:07:43,770
Oh, this?

4112
04:07:44,190 --> 04:07:44,850
Oh, might as well.

4113
04:07:47,450 --> 04:07:48,790
Your need requires...

4114
04:07:48,790 --> 04:07:50,850
You may use the grasp below to extend...

4115
04:07:50,850 --> 04:07:52,470
Okay, we'll need more grasp later.

4116
04:07:56,000 --> 04:07:57,400
I lack the grasp for this.

4117
04:07:58,080 --> 04:08:00,200
Uh, we'll grab swiftness then.

4118
04:08:02,080 --> 04:08:03,100
Okay, let's grab that.

4119
04:08:03,600 --> 04:08:05,500
There's the grave thirst aura by the silver pool.

4120
04:08:05,540 --> 04:08:06,300
I think...

4121
04:08:06,300 --> 04:08:06,960
Witchstaff?

4122
04:08:07,660 --> 04:08:09,180
We did the best with Witchstaff.

4123
04:08:10,060 --> 04:08:11,700
She fucked me so much.

4124
04:08:12,200 --> 04:08:15,840
So much with the goddamn curse that Witchstaff has...

4125
04:08:15,840 --> 04:08:17,820
Has been the only one that's saved me.

4126
04:08:20,840 --> 04:08:21,480
Oh,

4127
04:08:27,390 --> 04:08:28,670
I don't know.

4128
04:08:31,510 --> 04:08:33,150
Should we get...

4129
04:08:38,140 --> 04:08:41,080
Should we get this?

4130
04:08:43,900 --> 04:08:44,540
Uh...

4131
04:08:45,960 --> 04:08:46,880
That's true.

4132
04:08:47,000 --> 04:08:47,960
We could try it.

4133
04:08:48,600 --> 04:08:50,400
If we can make it.

4134
04:08:53,600 --> 04:08:56,100
The tube has been doing good for us, though.

4135
04:08:58,400 --> 04:08:59,820
Purse or Zeus?

4136
04:09:03,070 --> 04:09:04,370
Who's the guardian?

4137
04:09:08,150 --> 04:09:09,930
Stone will get better with more rings?

4138
04:09:10,410 --> 04:09:11,810
Should we just upgrade this?

4139
04:09:12,430 --> 04:09:16,970
When do we get the thing where we can change our items?

4140
04:09:17,590 --> 04:09:18,630
When do we get that?

4141
04:09:21,970 --> 04:09:23,170
Oh, the arena boss.

4142
04:09:23,530 --> 04:09:23,530
Okay.

4143
04:09:31,500 --> 04:09:31,860
Later?

4144
04:09:32,720 --> 04:09:33,700
But when is later?

4145
04:09:41,200 --> 04:09:41,940
So we get...

4146
04:09:41,940 --> 04:09:42,300
You know what?

4147
04:09:42,380 --> 04:09:43,780
Let's Let's do this for now.

4148
04:09:46,800 --> 04:09:47,300
I don't think we...

4149
04:09:47,300 --> 04:09:49,640
We have one death defiance, so it should be fine.

4150
04:09:53,530 --> 04:09:53,910
Yeah.

4151
04:09:55,270 --> 04:09:55,470
Oh?

4152
04:09:55,890 --> 04:09:58,150
You once held a place of honor in my father's house.

4153
04:09:58,670 --> 04:10:00,350
So you must know Cerberus, right?

4154
04:10:01,070 --> 04:10:05,130
I found him in the morning fields, coated in miasma, heads
to pause.

4155
04:10:06,090 --> 04:10:08,570
Was he always prone to uncontrolled fits of rage?

4156
04:10:12,560 --> 04:10:13,040
Oh, no.

4157
04:10:13,120 --> 04:10:14,060
He mostly sat around.

4158
04:10:14,500 --> 04:10:14,860
Yeah.

4159
04:10:14,940 --> 04:10:15,720
You go way back.

4160
04:10:15,800 --> 04:10:16,040
It's just...

4161
04:10:16,060 --> 04:10:23,620
I don't know why is he so mad seeing as he's kind of like a
dog and I'm kind of like a bone yeah I think like yeah he's

4162
04:10:23,620 --> 04:10:31,920
giving you some trouble huh it's not his fault Kronos must
have cast him from the house put him out to pasture I broke

4163
04:10:31,920 --> 04:10:41,210
through all the grime and calmed him down but he may need
another cleansing soon he never did like bears all right

4164
04:10:41,210 --> 04:10:55,970
let's go he is not a good boy that dog is not a good boy

we just got five boons we can do that but yeah no I

4172
04:12:03,710 --> 04:12:12,810
definitely I like I like the staff the most not even those
with the power to enter the crossroads at will can entirely

4173
04:12:12,810 --> 04:12:21,170
anticipate which of its three hidden paths shall be there's
three i still know the way yeah i was gonna say what do you

my play style okay Alright, money time.

4176
04:12:48,010 --> 04:12:50,970
I think it's the best just because I can button mash too.

4177
04:12:51,170 --> 04:12:51,890
I think that's why.

4178
04:12:52,550 --> 04:12:54,230
It's the easiest to button mash.

4179
04:12:56,790 --> 04:12:58,210
And it's like hit scan.

4180
04:13:01,030 --> 04:13:01,650
Uh, Zeus.

4181
04:13:02,730 --> 04:13:03,710
Zeus for the lightning.

4182
04:13:05,770 --> 04:13:06,530
What the fuck?

4183
04:13:06,610 --> 04:13:07,430
Oh, okay, he has armor.

4184
04:13:07,570 --> 04:13:08,070
I was gonna say.

4185
04:13:10,250 --> 04:13:12,150
How is he so strong and tanky?

4186
04:13:14,830 --> 04:13:16,770
My FPS brain.

4187
04:13:19,530 --> 04:13:21,490
Please explain this in Apex terms.

4188
04:13:23,550 --> 04:13:23,750
Oops.

4189
04:13:24,350 --> 04:13:25,490
I got distracted.

4190
04:13:32,570 --> 04:13:34,170
That's right.

4191
04:13:35,230 --> 04:13:36,890
There's more of us than there is him.

4192
04:13:40,390 --> 04:13:41,630
Uh, okay, attacks.

4193
04:13:45,370 --> 04:13:46,370
Attacks is better than...

4194
04:13:46,370 --> 04:13:47,690
Oh yeah, I use attacks more anyway.

4195
04:13:49,730 --> 04:13:50,490
Yeah, Ash.

4196
04:13:52,910 --> 04:13:53,870
Come, caskets.

4197
04:13:55,750 --> 04:13:56,710

4198
04:13:56,710 --> 04:13:57,590
Oh, shit, okay.

4199
04:13:58,490 --> 04:13:59,050
It's good.

4200
04:13:59,930 --> 04:14:01,290
That's good, we need Blitz.

4201
04:14:02,550 --> 04:14:04,190
We just need, like, thunder, and then...

4202
04:14:05,970 --> 04:14:07,650
God, they're so tanky.

4203
04:14:10,050 --> 04:14:10,950
Alright, nice.

4204
04:14:11,550 --> 04:14:12,210

04:14:15,650 --> 04:14:16,430
Let's grab...

4206
04:14:16,430 --> 04:14:17,450
We need boons anyway.

4207
04:14:17,670 --> 04:14:19,870
The more boons we have, the more dodges we can do.

4208
04:14:20,730 --> 04:14:21,790
Oh, my god!

4209
04:14:21,990 --> 04:14:23,270
Okay, that's fuck me, I guess.

4210
04:14:25,250 --> 04:14:26,770
Guess I won't go back in there.

4211
04:14:30,090 --> 04:14:30,890
Okay, danger.

4212
04:14:32,430 --> 04:14:33,170
Just do this.

4213
04:14:34,890 --> 04:14:35,950
I didn't do any damage, right?

4214
04:14:36,330 --> 04:14:37,090
Wait, no, I'm not.

4215
04:14:37,230 --> 04:14:37,990
God damn it!

4216
04:14:40,470 --> 04:14:41,430
Okay, that's fine.

4217
04:14:43,490 --> 04:14:44,230
That's five.

4218
04:14:47,940 --> 04:14:49,420
Are you fucking kidding me?

4219
04:14:51,180 --> 04:14:52,060
Oh my god.

4220
04:14:52,780 --> 04:14:53,300
Oh my god.

4221
04:14:53,460 --> 04:14:54,340
This guy is so annoying.

4222
04:14:55,220 --> 04:14:55,700
What?

4223
04:14:58,750 --> 04:14:59,510
Okay, that's five.

4224
04:15:00,190 --> 04:15:00,950
Okay, I hate.

4225
04:15:01,950 --> 04:15:04,650
I don't think I do not like that boss.

4226
04:15:05,790 --> 04:15:07,030
That boss is so annoying.

4227
04:15:09,030 --> 04:15:09,550
There you go.

4228
04:15:10,590 --> 04:15:11,770
Yeah, I had to go in.

4229
04:15:12,390 --> 04:15:14,150
My dad and I got on all right.

4230
04:15:14,410 --> 04:15:16,070
Comparatively speaking, I suppose.

4231
04:15:16,670 --> 04:15:26,490
after we put the titans in there it's okay i can rebuild

I think it's gonna fuck with me.

04:15:50,450 --> 04:15:51,250
3 for range?

4237
04:15:54,210 --> 04:15:56,310
Yeah, I remember I really didn't like 3.

4238
04:15:57,090 --> 04:15:57,810
Go for 2?

4239
04:16:04,660 --> 04:16:05,220
When we attack?

4240
04:16:05,820 --> 04:16:07,440
Yeah, I don't hold 2.

4241
04:16:08,700 --> 04:16:09,120
It's 1.

4242
04:16:09,200 --> 04:16:09,460
Okay.

4243
04:16:09,840 --> 04:16:10,620
We'll go with 1.

4244
04:16:11,460 --> 04:16:11,900
Oh, hey!

4245
04:16:12,360 --> 04:16:12,760

4246
04:16:12,980 --> 04:16:13,680
She's back!

4247
04:16:15,380 --> 04:16:16,940
Oh, I thought there was like a mic.

4248
04:16:20,140 --> 04:16:20,800
There you go.

4249
04:16:21,040 --> 04:16:22,280

4255
04:16:39,180 --> 04:16:39,700
Moonlight.

4256
04:16:40,300 --> 04:16:42,100
Have I gifted Moon before?

4257
04:16:42,480 --> 04:16:43,420
I don't think I have.

4258
04:16:43,680 --> 04:16:44,720
I'll give her one, too.

4259
04:16:45,320 --> 04:16:51,500

Thank you, thank you.

4261
04:16:52,700 --> 04:16:56,100
FYI, Odyssey was the only survivor, his whole crew died.

4262
04:16:56,540 --> 04:16:57,740
That's right, it was your fault.

4263
04:16:57,780 --> 04:17:00,540
But little star, you offer this to me.

4264
04:17:01,240 --> 04:17:04,580
The connection that we share as Silver Sisters is already
more than I can.

04:17:06,260 --> 04:17:06,360
See?

4266

It's like one internet year for them.

4311
04:20:35,240 --> 04:20:36,460
Alright, I'll do the sprint.

4312
04:20:39,020 --> 04:20:40,600
Yeah, I'll do this.

4313
04:20:41,740 --> 04:20:44,020
Oh, that sucks.

4314
04:20:44,140 --> 04:20:46,000
I don't have nectar for the gifter.

4315
04:20:48,040 --> 04:20:53,340
The intricately woven spider silk ensconcing the environs of
one gloom-filled recess.

4316
04:20:53,360 --> 04:20:53,560
That sucks.

4317
04:20:53,660 --> 04:20:54,880
I don't have any more nectar.

4318
04:20:55,300 --> 04:20:56,000
Wrangles and quality.

4319
04:20:56,520 --> 04:20:58,700
Even the weavings of the gods themselves.

4320
04:21:01,260 --> 04:21:02,520
Arachne knows how stuff...

4321
04:21:02,520 --> 04:21:02,880
It's truly you.

4322
04:21:03,600 --> 04:21:04,080
It's me.

4323
04:21:04,460 --> 04:21:05,640
Ah, but...

4324
04:21:09,590 --> 04:21:25,170
okay bitch what the fuck was that for me was so beautiful
I'm sorry to say I got into a bit of a scrape why did you

4325
04:21:25,170 --> 04:21:37,410
kept her ear that was her Tokyo is your fault that was her
dinner oh that's quite all right silly yeah sorry I'm so

4326
04:21:37,410 --> 04:21:40,050
sorry I'm I'm so sorry for ruining your dinner, guys.

4327
04:21:43,310 --> 04:21:44,250
Alright, nice.

4328
04:21:46,110 --> 04:21:49,810
That makes you cast deal 100% more damage.

4329
04:21:57,420 --> 04:21:58,020
Wait, what?

4330
04:21:58,220 --> 04:21:58,800
Donnie.

4331
04:21:59,320 --> 04:22:02,400
Do we want channel or 100%?

4332
04:22:03,420 --> 04:22:04,880
I don't use cast for damage.

4333
04:22:05,040 --> 04:22:05,500
I don't.

4334
04:22:05,580 --> 04:22:06,900
I just get channeled, right?

4335
04:22:11,380 --> 04:22:13,320
So then I can channel it faster.

4336
04:22:14,960 --> 04:22:15,560
Okay.

4337
04:22:16,140 --> 04:22:17,280
For more armor?

4338
04:22:19,920 --> 04:22:23,640
I rarely cast, but maybe I will cast if it's faster.

4339
04:22:29,690 --> 04:22:33,810
Okay, I'm gonna do one, because then if it's faster, I'll
start channeling more guys.

4340
04:22:35,270 --> 04:22:35,670
Of course.

4341
04:22:35,750 --> 04:22:36,530
Think about it.

4342
04:22:36,630 --> 04:22:37,270
Thank you, Arachni.

4343
04:22:39,510 --> 04:22:41,170
No, you won't.

4344
04:22:43,850 --> 04:22:45,130
Believe in myself.

4345
04:22:45,510 --> 04:22:46,130
See, look at that.

4346
04:22:46,190 --> 04:22:46,750
Oh, look at that.

4347
04:22:46,810 --> 04:22:47,630
I'm channeling.

4348
04:22:47,850 --> 04:22:48,490
Look at that.

4349
04:22:48,870 --> 04:22:50,410
Look how fast that is!

4350
04:22:50,850 --> 04:22:51,610
Guys, look at that!

4351
04:22:51,830 --> 04:22:52,650
See, I told you!

4352
04:22:53,170 --> 04:22:54,990
And then I almost have no more armor.

4353
04:22:55,510 --> 04:22:58,650
I- Okay.

4354
04:22:59,170 --> 04:23:05,590
I might have almost used up my armor, but look, I was trying
to send a message here.

4355
04:23:10,950 --> 04:23:13,030
I already lost half my armor.

4356
04:23:13,590 --> 04:23:14,950
But I sent my message.

4357
04:23:19,330 --> 04:23:19,890
Alright.

4358
04:23:21,910 --> 04:23:23,450
Uh, 150, okay.

4359
04:23:24,610 --> 04:23:25,890
Oh, wait, I want to talk to him first.

4360
04:23:27,190 --> 04:23:27,590
Yeah!

4361
04:23:27,890 --> 04:23:31,330
I didn't get into the details of what he discovered, though
perhaps you know more.

4362
04:23:35,250 --> 04:23:36,130
Oh, okay.

4363
04:23:36,990 --> 04:23:39,690
I thought you'd actually say something, but I guess not.

4364
04:23:40,990 --> 04:23:44,230
You really have to pay that care on character in these
situations.

4365
04:23:44,530 --> 04:23:46,150
What sort of daft system is that?

4366
04:23:46,810 --> 04:23:47,250
Yeah.

4367
04:23:49,310 --> 04:23:51,410
I mean, he's got to make his money somehow.

4368
04:23:53,310 --> 04:23:55,290
A cast repeal and inflicts scorch.

4369
04:23:55,890 --> 04:23:57,810
God, I did not like that.

4370
04:23:58,270 --> 04:24:01,450
Like, the enchants which is doubled against scorch
affiliate.

4371
04:24:01,550 --> 04:24:02,150
Oh, wait.

4372
04:24:02,950 --> 04:24:03,610
That's more dodge.

4373
04:24:03,710 --> 04:24:04,250
I don't know.

4374
04:24:04,490 --> 04:24:05,050
Do you have more damage?

4375
04:24:05,250 --> 04:24:05,450
Oh.

4376
04:24:06,570 --> 04:24:07,630
Oh, I don't know.

4377
04:24:16,690 --> 04:24:17,970
Snuff candle, right?

4378
04:24:18,170 --> 04:24:19,550
I could have more dodge.

4379
04:24:20,410 --> 04:24:21,490
Two for more dodge, right?

4380
04:24:22,310 --> 04:24:23,510
Because I already have a lot.

4381
04:24:23,670 --> 04:24:27,690
I could have, like, if I have more dodge.

4382
04:24:28,490 --> 04:24:30,050
Then, like, I'll never get hit.

4383
04:24:30,730 --> 04:24:31,570
Yeah, it'll stack.

4384
04:24:32,970 --> 04:24:34,670
I'll never get hit if I keep dodging.

4385
04:24:36,370 --> 04:24:37,850
That should be how it works.

4386
04:24:39,150 --> 04:24:39,770
Okay, let's see.

4387
04:24:40,090 --> 04:24:41,550
How much do I even have now?

4388
04:24:42,390 --> 04:24:43,190
For my dodge.

4389
04:24:46,070 --> 04:24:46,590
Where is it?

4390
04:24:46,630 --> 04:24:49,590
Gain dodge chance with the more boons you have.

4391
04:24:49,650 --> 04:24:51,170
I have so many boons.

4392
04:24:52,050 --> 04:24:53,870
How much more does he want from me?

4393
04:24:56,250 --> 04:24:57,410
What concerns you?

4394
04:24:57,870 --> 04:25:06,090
I heard from Hermes headmistress He gave me the impression
that Olympus needs me Yeah, my 2.5% is building guys It's

I feel like I need more HP.

4451
04:29:04,380 --> 04:29:05,180
I don't know.

4452
04:29:06,120 --> 04:29:06,560
BGM.

4453
04:29:06,920 --> 04:29:07,940
I mean, I still have it.

4454
04:29:08,900 --> 04:29:09,880
Boon always?

4455
04:29:11,360 --> 04:29:12,540
Uh, alright.

4456
04:29:12,820 --> 04:29:13,400
Down the drain.

4457
04:29:16,220 --> 04:29:17,820
Oh my god, it's these guys.

4458
04:29:18,360 --> 04:29:18,940
Oh, fuck.

4459
04:29:19,080 --> 04:29:19,280
Okay.

4460
04:29:20,000 --> 04:29:20,500
That's five.

4461
04:29:21,940 --> 04:29:23,260
Oh, I missed my cast.

4462
04:29:25,540 --> 04:29:26,080
Okay, it's five.

4463
04:29:28,940 --> 04:29:29,640
Okay, that's five.

4464
04:29:30,200 --> 04:29:30,780
God, I hate...

4465
04:29:30,780 --> 04:29:31,820
These guys have armor, too.

4466
04:29:31,840 --> 04:29:32,580
That's the worst part.

4467
04:29:33,340 --> 04:29:35,060
I think the worst part is that it has armor.

4468
04:29:36,260 --> 04:29:36,560
You know what?

4469
04:29:36,620 --> 04:29:37,400
Fuck it.

4470
04:29:40,260 --> 04:29:42,580
Okay, as long as I get rid of these guys...

4471
04:29:43,420 --> 04:29:44,540
My clothes!

4472
04:29:45,160 --> 04:29:45,500
Oh!

4473
04:29:49,350 --> 04:29:50,690
It is so much!

4474
04:29:54,780 --> 04:29:55,540
Okay.

4475
04:29:56,280 --> 04:29:57,080
Ermi's tab.

4476
04:29:59,320 --> 04:30:01,780
Oh, yeah.

4477
04:30:01,880 --> 04:30:03,580
My attack's special and cast are faster.

4478
04:30:05,760 --> 04:30:06,940
That's good.

4479
04:30:09,900 --> 04:30:12,800
I will do chop.

4480
04:30:14,260 --> 04:30:16,080
I lost my clothes, guys.

4481
04:30:16,340 --> 04:30:17,000
Oh, really?

4482
04:30:17,940 --> 04:30:19,160
Oh, come on.

4483
04:30:20,100 --> 04:30:21,660
I don't have enough.

4484
04:30:24,040 --> 04:30:26,680
Cast, inflicts, freeze, and...

4485
04:30:26,880 --> 04:30:27,580
That's good.

4486
04:30:28,460 --> 04:30:28,720
Wait.

4487
04:30:29,200 --> 04:30:30,060

Oh, yeah, where did she go?

4666
04:43:52,870 --> 04:43:54,270
She actually finally moved away.

4667
04:43:54,830 --> 04:43:59,710
In regard to an impediment you may confront when finally you
reach the far end of the morning fields.

4668
04:44:00,610 --> 04:44:03,090
Reports suggested some sort of infernal beast.

corroborate our shades reports and add that this infernal

Into the dock.

4716
04:49:21,160 --> 04:49:21,920
Alright, back.

What's this?

4720
04:49:24,860 --> 04:49:26,500
Is he going to fit me for a suit of armor?

4721
04:49:27,300 --> 04:49:30,620
In the name of Hades, Olympus, I accept this message.

4722
04:49:34,880 --> 04:49:35,360
Whoa!

4723
04:49:36,320 --> 04:49:38,180
They told me you needed a weapon or something.

4724
04:49:39,280 --> 04:49:40,280
You already got one.

4725
04:49:40,680 --> 04:49:43,980
Right, lousy one can spot that piece of war workmanship from
here.

4726
04:49:44,680 --> 04:49:46,900
Though, I could tune it up.

4727
04:49:47,180 --> 04:49:48,300
Oh, what does he offer?

4728
04:49:50,420 --> 04:49:57,460
Your special can cost a divination of the elements i cannot
see the essence of olympian boons these incidents in print

4729
04:49:57,460 --> 04:50:02,940
only have no bloom somewhere i offer power for you to grow
stronger of your elemental essence when you take damage

can damn succession of flows in the binding uh your specials

4732
04:50:20,820 --> 04:50:23,180
Oh, one is good.

4733
04:50:23,900 --> 04:50:26,320
Yeah, isn't he supposed to be, like, super ugly?

4734
04:50:26,520 --> 04:50:29,560
And then, like, the gods forced a woman to marry him?

4735
04:50:33,100 --> 04:50:34,340
Isn't that his lore?

4736
04:50:34,620 --> 04:50:36,200
And they're like, Yoki, that is so mean.

4737
04:50:36,520 --> 04:50:38,440
I don't write the lore.

4738
04:50:39,760 --> 04:50:42,120
Like, I don't write it.

4739
04:50:44,640 --> 04:50:45,760
Why are you...

4740
04:50:45,760 --> 04:50:46,460
That's...

4741
04:50:46,460 --> 04:50:47,080
I...

4742
04:50:47,080 --> 04:50:49,660
Don't blame me for how fucked up they were.

4743
04:50:49,680 --> 04:50:50,660
wrote it?

4744
04:50:53,160 --> 04:50:54,480
That's his lore!

4745
04:50:55,420 --> 04:50:57,120
Just like me.

4746
04:50:58,860 --> 04:51:01,880
No, apparently it's like super ugly or some shit.

4747
04:51:03,260 --> 04:51:04,440
But like super smart.

4748
04:51:08,000 --> 04:51:08,960
Oh hey.

4749
04:51:09,520 --> 04:51:10,040
The send.

4750
04:51:10,780 --> 04:51:11,500
Minus 11?

4751
04:51:11,800 --> 04:51:12,780
Is it worth it?

4752
04:51:15,900 --> 04:51:18,260
Yeah, and then his wife cheats on him all the time.

4753
04:51:20,580 --> 04:51:21,220
Okay.

4754
04:51:21,240 --> 04:51:23,880
It wants some of my life essence before letting me in.

4755
04:51:25,380 --> 04:51:25,800
All right.

4756
04:51:26,360 --> 04:51:26,760
Fine.

4757
04:51:27,700 --> 04:51:28,480
Yeah, it's only blood.

4758
04:51:29,480 --> 04:51:30,420
It's not that bad.

4759
04:51:33,460 --> 04:51:36,620
Oh, it's, oh, it's, um, chaos.

4760
04:51:37,380 --> 04:51:42,100
Well, in the name of Hades, Olympus, are you there?

4761
04:51:42,980 --> 04:51:44,280
Oh, yeah, I forgot it was Aphrodite.

4762
04:51:44,540 --> 04:51:44,780
Yeah.

4763
04:51:48,480 --> 04:51:49,000
Yeah.

4764
04:51:49,000 --> 04:51:49,720
Oh, shit.

4765
04:51:53,360 --> 04:51:55,220
Bro, that's a fucking baby.

4766
04:51:55,360 --> 04:51:57,760
I can't wait.

4767
04:51:58,200 --> 04:51:58,340
I can't wait.

4768
04:51:58,360 --> 04:51:59,540
I can't wait.

4769
04:51:59,940 --> 04:52:01,100
I can't wait.

4770
04:52:01,100 --> 04:52:01,820
I can't wait.

4771
04:52:02,160 --> 04:52:04,740
I'm honored to make your acquaintance.

4772
04:52:05,400 --> 04:52:08,660
What sort of quandary would concern the origin of all
existence?

4773
04:52:09,680 --> 04:52:09,920
Yeah.

4774
04:52:10,140 --> 04:52:13,140
I can't even use that baby.

4775
04:52:13,820 --> 04:52:13,980
I can't wait.

4776
04:52:13,980 --> 04:52:17,660
But at present, I have inferred that your response, in
essence, was affirmative.

4777
04:52:18,460 --> 04:52:22,100
I'll say our newly formed arrangement, fruit posed
interesting.

4778
04:52:22,820 --> 04:52:23,260
I can't wait.

4779

4782
04:53:10,610 --> 04:53:11,750
I wasn't paying attention.

4783
04:53:14,590 --> 04:53:15,570
Oh, next two boons.

4784
04:53:15,730 --> 04:53:16,890
Okay, I need to just find boons.

4785
04:53:22,260 --> 04:53:23,320
Okay, I just need to...

4786
04:53:23,320 --> 04:53:25,340
If I fast-track the boons, it should be fine.

4787
04:53:30,060 --> 04:53:31,000
Okay, nice.

4788
04:53:33,260 --> 04:53:35,480
Alright, let's just get that out of the way.

4789
04:53:36,320 --> 04:53:36,840
Oh, yeah.

4790
04:53:37,460 --> 04:53:38,320
Dig a tunnel.

4791
04:53:39,180 --> 04:53:40,800
Alright, let's go the meter.

4792
04:53:42,400 --> 04:53:43,620

Alright, wait.

4795
04:53:47,080 --> 04:53:48,960
Let me kill these guys, and then I can read it.

4796
04:53:51,480 --> 04:53:51,580
Whoa.

4797
04:53:51,960 --> 04:53:52,200
It's okay.

4798
04:53:52,280 --> 04:53:53,160
She can't move anywhere.

4799
04:53:53,360 --> 04:53:54,040
That's right.

4800
04:53:55,300 --> 04:53:56,080
Got you.

4801
04:53:57,040 --> 04:53:58,160

Thank you.

4803
04:54:00,340 --> 04:54:01,080
Thank you.

4804
04:54:01,080 --> 04:54:04,840
I know it's off-topping, but I passed my chem lab by 0.08%.

4805
04:54:04,840 --> 04:54:05,620
Thanks for being here.

4806
04:54:05,860 --> 04:54:07,000
Doing my long lab write-ups.

4807
04:54:07,540 --> 04:54:08,440
Congratulations, Gil!

4808
04:54:09,000 --> 04:54:10,140
Congratulations on passing.

4809
04:54:10,240 --> 04:54:11,060
I know you can do it.

4810
04:54:11,120 --> 04:54:12,660
She must have deemed the risk too great.

4811
04:54:13,980 --> 04:54:14,860
I understand.

4812
04:54:16,120 --> 04:54:17,580
I'll try to understand.

4813
04:54:19,540 --> 04:54:21,320
It's okay, I'm alive at least.

4814
04:54:22,560 --> 04:54:26,320
I swear to God, if that was the freeze, I would have been so
fucking mad.

4815
04:54:27,440 --> 04:54:28,380
I swear to God.

4816
04:54:31,840 --> 04:54:33,060
One or two.

4817
04:54:33,200 --> 04:54:35,160
I would have been, I swear to God, this was the freeze.

4818
04:54:35,360 --> 04:54:36,520
I swear to fucking God.

4819
04:54:39,920 --> 04:54:41,440
Too early is good, yeah.

4820
04:54:42,680 --> 04:54:43,420
What's this?

4821
04:54:44,200 --> 04:54:45,520
Is there anything good?

4822
04:54:45,840 --> 04:54:47,640
I don't have a lot of money.

4823
04:54:50,400 --> 04:54:53,200
You know, receive in that amount instead.

4824
04:54:55,920 --> 04:54:57,400
Oh, expires after one hit.

4825
04:54:59,240 --> 04:54:59,700
Yeah, no.

4826
04:55:00,580 --> 04:55:03,080
Your move deals 50% damage.

4827
04:55:03,260 --> 04:55:04,080
Six encounters.

4828
04:55:08,260 --> 04:55:09,820
Yeah, it's not worth, right?

4829
04:55:09,880 --> 04:55:11,060
None of these are worth it.

4830
04:55:11,560 --> 04:55:11,880
Yeah.

4831
04:55:14,420 --> 04:55:15,640

4832
04:55:15,960 --> 04:55:16,780
Oh, yeah, you're right.

4833
04:55:16,860 --> 04:55:17,340
It's 15 good.

4834
04:55:17,400 --> 04:55:17,920
Yeah, I pass.

4835
04:55:18,080 --> 04:55:18,660
I'll save it.

4836
04:55:27,940 --> 04:55:28,440
Aphrodite?

4837
04:55:28,620 --> 04:55:29,680
Oh, this is hard.

4838
04:55:30,140 --> 04:55:30,820
Husband or wife?

4839
04:55:33,420 --> 04:55:34,500
Husband or wife?

4840
04:55:35,300 --> 04:55:35,640
Hef?

4841
04:55:36,880 --> 04:55:37,880
All right.

4842
04:55:40,720 --> 04:55:43,180
And I get my thing, too, here.

4843
04:55:45,020 --> 04:55:45,980
I remember that that.

4844
04:55:48,000 --> 04:55:48,780

4845
04:55:52,180 --> 04:55:53,420
Oh, there you go.

4846
04:55:54,420 --> 04:55:57,680
Alright, that should fix my thing too.

4847
04:55:59,020 --> 04:56:00,420
Olympus, I accept this message.

4848
04:56:07,420 --> 04:56:08,460
But you primed.

4849
04:56:12,200 --> 04:56:13,260
I'm so sad.

4850
04:56:13,440 --> 04:56:14,640
I'm... Fuck you, Chaos.

4851
04:56:15,740 --> 04:56:16,240
I'm...

4852
04:56:18,660 --> 04:56:20,200
I don't have enough money.

4853
04:56:20,440 --> 04:56:21,040
I'll go... Oh, wait.

4854
04:56:21,060 --> 04:56:21,500
I got it.

4855
04:56:21,560 --> 04:56:21,760
Okay.

4856
04:56:22,900 --> 04:56:23,400
So...

4857
04:56:24,680 --> 04:56:26,520
What was her bonus again?

4858
04:56:26,700 --> 04:56:28,260
What did she eat?

4859
04:56:31,820 --> 04:56:33,580
Oh, yeah, I used minus 6%.

4860
04:56:33,580 --> 04:56:34,200
There you go.

4861
04:56:38,220 --> 04:56:38,820
Okay.

4862
04:56:39,100 --> 04:56:39,800
Are you serious?

4863
04:56:41,100 --> 04:56:42,120
Oh my god!

4864
04:56:43,840 --> 04:56:44,780

4866
04:56:47,220 --> 04:56:48,640
I'll kill her first.

4867
04:56:52,320 --> 04:56:52,640
Okay.

4868
04:56:56,000 --> 04:56:56,600
Okay.

4869
04:56:58,440 --> 04:56:58,980
There you are.

04:56:59,120 --> 04:56:59,580
I broke it.

4871
04:57:00,160 --> 04:57:01,040
That's just good.

4872
04:57:02,440 --> 04:57:02,460
Nice.

4873
04:57:02,600 --> 04:57:03,300
I broke the thing.

4874
04:57:04,020 --> 04:57:04,960
I broke the curse.

4875
04:57:06,380 --> 04:57:07,560
And I still got hit.

4876
04:57:08,640 --> 04:57:09,980
The shadows dissipate.

4877
04:57:11,060 --> 04:57:13,100
I broke the curse, but I still got hit.

4878
04:57:16,700 --> 04:57:18,120

Because you guys kept fucking.

4891
04:58:55,400 --> 04:59:06,080

Apollo was very kind say i'm not his twin i thought you

4892

sibling you just didn't tell him how long ago that was so

4894

going to find chronos and slay him i don't think you don't

4895
04:59:30,740 --> 04:59:36,540
stand a chance but they don't have a lot of She calls me

4896
04:59:37,300 --> 04:59:38,760
I don't know one of them calls me sister.

4897
04:59:39,540 --> 04:59:40,360
They all blur together.

4898
04:59:44,940 --> 04:59:46,160
Damage by my cast.

4899
04:59:46,360 --> 04:59:46,720

Oh, wait, that's also good.

4902
04:59:51,380 --> 04:59:53,380
Any damage you deal may be critical.

Oh, but 3%.

4904
04:59:58,160 --> 04:59:59,500
I don't know.

4905
05:00:00,800 --> 05:00:02,220

4906
05:00:02,220 --> 05:00:03,320
Okay, 50 is not that.

4907
05:00:03,340 --> 05:00:07,180

4909
05:00:27,450 --> 05:00:32,010

Yeah, I was thinking about that too.

4915
05:00:54,210 --> 05:00:56,470
I was like, well three is any attack, so.

4916
05:00:57,090 --> 05:00:59,810
That's like the only thing that's cool about it.

4917

I'm back, girl.

4926
05:01:18,470 --> 05:01:20,670
I saw you get into a scuffle with the great big witch.

4927
05:01:21,230 --> 05:01:21,930
Why are you fighting?

4928
05:01:22,570 --> 05:01:23,750
I thought you were on the same side.

4929
05:01:24,250 --> 05:01:26,450
I'm in this eternal test that she's giving me.

4930
05:01:26,770 --> 05:01:28,470
It's like the SCATs that never ends.

4931
05:01:31,510 --> 05:01:33,370
Headmistress and I aren't really fighting.

4932
05:01:33,810 --> 05:01:35,950
Well, no, I suppose we are.

4933
05:01:36,330 --> 05:01:38,470
Except it isn't born of anger or misunderstanding.

4934
05:01:39,310 --> 05:01:41,370
It's just her way of making certain I'm prepared.

4935
05:01:42,770 --> 05:01:43,170
Huh.

4936
05:01:43,590 --> 05:01:44,190
Well, look.

4937
05:01:44,410 --> 05:01:46,290

05:02:24,150 --> 05:02:24,950
I'll do the boon.

4943
05:02:25,930 --> 05:02:26,750
We don't need magic.

4944
05:02:30,350 --> 05:02:30,930
Okay, nice.

4945
05:02:33,030 --> 05:02:33,470

Alright, what do I get?

4963
05:03:32,610 --> 05:03:34,230
Her attack hits two times.

4964
05:03:34,390 --> 05:03:37,750
You can channel your special to deal 300% damage.

4965
05:03:40,210 --> 05:03:41,250
Oh, shit.

4966
05:03:42,090 --> 05:03:42,830
Wait, three.

4971
05:04:02,630 --> 05:04:04,910
300% on special though

05:10:13,010 --> 05:10:14,010
Where the fuck?

5042
05:10:17,030 --> 05:10:18,370
I feel like Zeus, right?

5043
05:10:18,590 --> 05:10:19,630
Zeus is always better.

5044
05:10:20,470 --> 05:10:21,010
For the Blitz.

5045
05:10:21,250 --> 05:10:22,190
Oh my god, it's him again.

5046
05:10:22,750 --> 05:10:23,450
Oh my god.

5047
05:10:24,110 --> 05:10:25,210
Oh my god, not him.

5048
05:10:25,670 --> 05:10:26,150
Not him.

5049
05:10:26,430 --> 05:10:28,750
I don't know why, but he's my kryptonite.

5050
05:10:29,350 --> 05:10:30,630
He's so strong.

5051
05:10:31,910 --> 05:10:32,670
I get hit.

5052
05:10:32,930 --> 05:10:33,530
I don't know.

5053
05:10:33,610 --> 05:10:35,750
I don't know what it is about this guy.

5054
05:10:37,270 --> 05:10:38,350
Oh, fuck.

5055
05:10:38,770 --> 05:10:39,390
I told you.

5056
05:10:39,710 --> 05:10:41,830
I don't know what it is about him.

5057
05:10:43,010 --> 05:10:49,030
fucking I just keep getting hit by him and just him

5058
05:10:53,200 --> 05:10:55,680
there's just something about him guys

5059
05:11:00,780 --> 05:11:12,780
there you go he's always come back oh wait what the fuck
okay I was like what did I dig where exactly are you young

5060
05:11:12,780 --> 05:11:19,660
lady the outskirts of Poseidon's realm You mean to
circumnavigate your father's domain?

5061
05:11:20,480 --> 05:11:23,660
Why confront the armies of Tronus head-on when you could go
around?

5062
05:11:23,800 --> 05:11:24,240
Exactly!

5063
05:11:24,480 --> 05:11:26,020
He'll never know- expect me!

5064
05:11:26,440 --> 05:11:27,660
Why don't we all do that?

5065
05:11:28,880 --> 05:11:30,160
A cast-cost lightning.

5066
05:11:30,760 --> 05:11:31,720
To repeatedly strike.

5067
05:11:32,060 --> 05:11:32,880
Your strike- Oh, wait!

5068
05:11:32,960 --> 05:11:33,160
No!

5069
05:11:33,240 --> 05:11:34,200
Your strike's aim!

5070
05:11:34,580 --> 05:11:35,200
We should get three!

5071
05:11:36,380 --> 05:11:37,080
One or three!

5072
05:11:39,960 --> 05:11:42,040
Because then there's, like, lightning, too.

5073
05:11:44,000 --> 05:11:46,300
There's the lightning strikes that bounces up to four
attacks.

5074
05:11:46,320 --> 05:11:47,440
But Prime's 50.

5075
05:11:47,520 --> 05:11:49,020
Oh, I don't have magic anymore.

5076
05:11:51,160 --> 05:11:53,040
Guys, that takes up all my magic.

5077
05:11:56,200 --> 05:11:57,720
Yeah, I'll have zero magic.

5078
05:11:57,880 --> 05:11:58,520
Is it worth it?

5079
05:12:04,510 --> 05:12:05,170
I have four.

5080
05:12:05,510 --> 05:12:06,670
Is it worth it?

5081
05:12:14,710 --> 05:12:15,490
Does two.

5082
05:12:15,630 --> 05:12:16,590
Okay, we'll do.

5083
05:12:24,300 --> 05:12:25,580
One does a ton of damage.

5084
05:12:25,960 --> 05:12:25,960
Okay.

5085
05:12:26,620 --> 05:12:28,080
I like the sound of that.

5086
05:12:28,480 --> 05:12:31,780
I hear lots of damage and I'm like, I like damage.

5087
05:12:34,780 --> 05:12:36,360
That sounds good.

5088
05:12:38,780 --> 05:12:40,780
I like lots of damage.

5089
05:12:43,940 --> 05:12:45,220
Jesus Christ.

5090
05:12:46,920 --> 05:12:47,820
Get nice.

5091
05:12:50,220 --> 05:12:51,000
Get in the thunder!

5092
05:12:51,540 --> 05:12:52,420
That's right!

5093
05:12:53,080 --> 05:12:53,920
Zeus, take you.

5094
05:12:55,420 --> 05:12:56,120
Oh, hey, nice.

5095
05:12:56,160 --> 05:12:57,080
It's Narcissist again.

5096
05:12:57,200 --> 05:12:58,120
You know where I'm going.

5097
05:13:00,680 --> 05:13:01,120
Hello.

5098
05:13:02,420 --> 05:13:04,160
I'll always pick you.

5099
05:13:05,980 --> 05:13:07,660
Why do I always see him?

5100
05:13:08,400 --> 05:13:11,520
In fact, why don't you stand a little farther back?

5101
05:13:12,140 --> 05:13:13,480
I'm sorry, I know.

5102
05:13:13,960 --> 05:13:17,160
My ugliness is making your handsomeness go down.

5103
05:13:17,380 --> 05:13:17,760
I'm sorry.

5104
05:13:18,000 --> 05:13:19,200
It's my fault.

5105
05:13:19,380 --> 05:13:19,640
I know.

5106
05:13:20,420 --> 05:13:23,780
I thought I'd take this rather scenic route through this
chamber of yours.

5107
05:13:25,380 --> 05:13:26,500
Oh, it isn't my chamber.

5108
05:13:26,920 --> 05:13:29,300
I just find the waters here particularly cleanly.

5109
05:13:30,040 --> 05:13:31,780
And far fewer would-be suitors than I have seen.

Oh, shit.

5122
05:14:51,290 --> 05:14:53,010
I sense the elemental essence is here.

5123
05:14:53,410 --> 05:14:54,370
More boons and build.

5124
05:14:54,490 --> 05:14:55,370
You have two now.

5125
05:14:57,750 --> 05:14:59,030
Wait, but then I can restore magic.

5126
05:14:59,410 --> 05:15:00,190
Oh, fuck, this is hard.

5127
05:15:01,230 --> 05:15:02,310
Old cast again.

5128
05:15:04,150 --> 05:15:04,590
Okay.

5129
05:15:06,550 --> 05:15:08,370
I have two right now.

5130
05:15:12,930 --> 05:15:13,870
So I feel like...

5131
05:15:13,870 --> 05:15:15,210
I just need more Hestia stuff.

5132
05:15:15,370 --> 05:15:15,510
Yeah.

5133
05:15:17,230 --> 05:15:18,590
I don't need Magic Restore.

5134
05:15:18,690 --> 05:15:19,510
I feel like...

5135
05:15:21,610 --> 05:15:22,650
Oh my god.

5137
05:15:24,750 --> 05:15:25,670
But two is so good.

5138
05:15:25,950 --> 05:15:26,670
Two more damage.

5139
05:15:26,790 --> 05:15:27,130
You're right.

5140
05:15:27,770 --> 05:15:29,750
I don't need Magic if I can do more damage.

5141
05:15:30,710 --> 05:15:32,850
Ain't a random item offered from the...

5142

Well, a gain plus two now.

05:15:42,790 --> 05:15:43,710

05:15:47,390 --> 05:15:48,590

05:15:50,450 --> 05:15:50,830
Oh, yay.

5149
05:15:51,050 --> 05:15:52,130
Minus 10% damage.

5150
05:15:52,250 --> 05:15:52,710
Look at that.

5151

5178
05:17:15,560 --> 05:17:15,660
Blitz.

5179
05:17:16,180 --> 05:17:16,860
Boon.

5180
05:17:18,200 --> 05:17:19,080
Oh, shit.

5181
05:17:20,360 --> 05:17:20,780
Oh, okay.

5182
05:17:26,910 --> 05:17:28,170
That's more Lightning.

5183
05:17:29,270 --> 05:17:29,850
Or Attack.

5184
05:17:31,110 --> 05:17:32,230
Attack or three.

5185
05:17:32,350 --> 05:17:32,550
Okay.

5186
05:17:33,290 --> 05:17:34,270
Blitz, right?

5187
05:17:35,210 --> 05:17:36,770
Blitz damage 100, though?

5188
05:17:38,670 --> 05:17:39,610
There is more Survival?

5189
05:17:40,210 --> 05:17:41,410
Yeah, but Prime's 30.

5190
05:17:42,170 --> 05:17:42,870
I'll do one.

5191
05:17:43,010 --> 05:17:44,370
And then we'll grab them where Ash.

5192
05:17:45,550 --> 05:17:46,530
Alright, let's try again.

5193
05:17:47,170 --> 05:17:48,510
I don't think it works, guys.

5194
05:17:49,510 --> 05:17:52,550
Every time I go in, she's not mad at me.

5195
05:17:53,730 --> 05:17:55,890
Okay, now she judges my clothes.

5196
05:18:02,990 --> 05:18:03,870
Oh, wait!

5197
05:18:05,150 --> 05:18:06,390
Is that the dialogue?

5198
05:18:09,350 --> 05:18:10,350
Is that it?

5199
05:18:11,890 --> 05:18:12,990
Why is she so mad?

5200
05:18:13,010 --> 05:18:15,270
Man, your singing just sucks.

5201
05:18:15,590 --> 05:18:16,290
Or else what?

5202
05:18:16,750 --> 05:18:18,350
I'll use what tactics I see fit.

5203
05:18:18,850 --> 05:18:23,290
Not having to listen to you spout your nonsense makes it
easier to send you back to the depths for the night.

5204
05:18:24,230 --> 05:18:27,570
Bro, your music is just not my taste, bro.

5205
05:18:28,290 --> 05:18:30,110
You know you like our song.

5206
05:18:30,370 --> 05:18:31,610
Can't live without it.

5207
05:18:32,030 --> 05:18:34,010
And I will not be silenced.

5208
05:18:34,650 --> 05:18:39,570
No matter what you do, I'll always be singing in my head and
yours.

5209
05:18:40,930 --> 05:18:41,990
Not my fault.

5210
05:18:42,230 --> 05:18:42,570
Look.

5211
05:18:43,010 --> 05:18:44,930
I just don't enjoy it.

5212
05:18:45,390 --> 05:18:59,610
Some people just stop Okay, I was not expecting all that
damage guys Are you fucking kidding me?

5213
05:19:01,990 --> 05:19:05,310
Okay, that's fine Jesus Christ.

5214
05:19:05,710 --> 05:19:06,570
It's fine.

5215
05:19:06,870 --> 05:19:07,410
It's fine.

5216
05:19:10,710 --> 05:19:13,790
Okay, rhythm gone That's good.

5217
05:19:14,050 --> 05:19:14,590
Rhythm, God!

5218
05:19:15,430 --> 05:19:16,170
Are you serious?

5219
05:19:20,920 --> 05:19:21,820
Oh no.

5220
05:19:22,580 --> 05:19:23,140
Okay, it's fine.

5221
05:19:24,780 --> 05:19:25,080
Nice.

5222
05:19:30,130 --> 05:19:31,910
Gotta get rid of...

5223
05:19:31,910 --> 05:19:33,150
Just gotta get rid of her now.

5224
05:19:34,010 --> 05:19:34,250
Nice.

5225
05:19:36,450 --> 05:19:37,010
Nice.

5226
05:19:37,830 --> 05:19:39,090
Alright, it's featuring time.

5227
05:19:39,730 --> 05:19:40,990
Alright, she's the feature artist.

5228
05:19:44,150 --> 05:19:45,030
Oh god.

5229
05:19:45,870 --> 05:19:46,950
Oh god, I gotta be more careful.

5230
05:19:49,210 --> 05:19:49,690
Fuck!

5231
05:19:55,210 --> 05:19:55,930
Are you serious?

5232
05:19:57,330 --> 05:19:58,530
Oh no, I might lose my tooth.

5233
05:19:59,030 --> 05:20:00,690
No, I'm not my tooth, but...

5234
05:20:00,690 --> 05:20:01,190
Oh god.

5235
05:20:06,110 --> 05:20:06,350
Okay.

5236
05:20:07,570 --> 05:20:08,150
No, no, no, no, no!

5237
05:20:13,000 --> 05:20:13,580
Am I?

5238
05:20:14,000 --> 05:20:14,260
No.

5239
05:20:17,480 --> 05:20:18,240
It's fine.

5240
05:20:20,400 --> 05:20:21,900
Rhythm god, rhythm god.

5241
05:20:27,620 --> 05:20:28,100
Nice!

5242
05:20:28,840 --> 05:20:29,860
No more basses!

5243
05:20:33,900 --> 05:20:34,380
Okay.

5244
05:20:34,400 --> 05:20:34,980
Alright.

5245
05:20:39,560 --> 05:20:40,360
Oh, God.

5246
05:20:41,260 --> 05:20:42,280
This is bad for me, though.

5247
05:20:42,480 --> 05:20:42,760
No!

5248
05:20:42,980 --> 05:20:43,200
Oh!

5249
05:20:43,380 --> 05:20:44,240
Oh, that's so close.

5250
05:20:44,340 --> 05:20:44,980
That's so close.

5251
05:20:45,400 --> 05:20:46,400
I almost got hit.

5252
05:20:46,660 --> 05:20:48,180
I almost got hit by the fishes.

5253
05:20:49,460 --> 05:20:50,020
Oh!

5254
05:20:50,600 --> 05:20:51,980

5258
05:21:01,240 --> 05:21:01,980
That's right.

5259
05:21:02,780 --> 05:21:03,920
Canceled another tour.

5260
05:21:04,560 --> 05:21:05,920
You'll never get the music.

5261
05:21:05,920 --> 05:21:14,240
Your fans will never get your music While I'm still alive

05:23:55,150 --> 05:23:56,110
Oh, your tax rate.

Oh, fuck.

5294
05:23:58,370 --> 05:23:59,270
I think faster.

5295
05:24:01,950 --> 05:24:02,910
Oh, hammer last.

5296
05:24:03,010 --> 05:24:04,030
Oh, whoops, too late.

5297
05:24:04,810 --> 05:24:05,610
It's too late.

5298
05:24:07,690 --> 05:24:08,530
Oh, fuck.

5299
05:24:09,710 --> 05:24:10,690
No echo.

5300
05:24:12,930 --> 05:24:14,530
I forgot echo existed.

5301
05:24:18,850 --> 05:24:20,070
One or three.

5302
05:24:24,150 --> 05:24:25,750
I forgot about it.

5303
05:24:25,870 --> 05:24:26,910
It's been so long.

5304
05:24:29,410 --> 05:24:30,430
Whoa, you can't say that.

5305
05:24:30,530 --> 05:24:31,010
She's my OG.

5306
05:24:33,310 --> 05:24:34,930
Power or faster?

5307
05:24:36,870 --> 05:24:37,410
Ah.

5308
05:24:38,670 --> 05:24:42,190
This is hard.

5309
05:24:46,720 --> 05:24:47,680
This is so hard.

5310
05:24:49,320 --> 05:24:50,380
Maybe for moms?

5311
05:24:51,160 --> 05:24:52,760
One for... Okay, bosses.

5312
05:24:52,980 --> 05:24:54,080
I'm thinking about boss fights.

5313
05:24:55,080 --> 05:24:55,900
Parts not claimed.

5314
05:24:56,060 --> 05:24:57,440
Okay, I need to grab the rewards then.

5315
05:24:58,520 --> 05:24:59,060
Yeah, I'm gonna...

5316
05:24:59,060 --> 05:25:00,780
I'm gonna think about the bosses first.

5317
05:25:06,670 --> 05:25:07,450
They're over here.

5318
05:25:07,590 --> 05:25:08,210
You know, fuck you.

5319
05:25:09,330 --> 05:25:10,550
Yeah, that's fucking right.

5320
05:25:12,070 --> 05:25:12,830
That's right!

5321
05:25:13,990 --> 05:25:15,150
Grab the life.

5322
05:25:18,490 --> 05:25:20,070
And then now another flower.

5323
05:25:25,940 --> 05:25:27,520
Okay, I gotta kill her first.

5324
05:25:28,040 --> 05:25:29,960
Hate the Medusas so much.

5325
05:25:33,520 --> 05:25:35,360
Medusas are the most annoying one.

5326
05:25:38,880 --> 05:25:40,060
Alright, hey, more HP though.

5327
05:25:40,640 --> 05:25:41,160
More HP.

5328
05:25:42,260 --> 05:25:43,160
Wait, there's another tree?

5329
05:25:44,660 --> 05:25:45,700
Goddammit, it's the Echo.

5330
05:25:47,040 --> 05:25:48,000
Restore 37.

5331
05:25:48,320 --> 05:25:48,920
Wait, how much?

5332
05:25:49,100 --> 05:25:51,060
Okay, oh, I could get HP now.

5333
05:25:57,060 --> 05:25:57,540
Uh...

5334
05:26:03,820 --> 05:26:05,320
Okay, I'm gonna get HP.

5335
05:26:07,220 --> 05:26:09,520
So I can be fully healed.

5336
05:26:10,860 --> 05:26:11,520
Uh, alright.

5337
05:26:12,020 --> 05:26:12,660
It's okay, guys.

5338
05:26:12,700 --> 05:26:13,700
I had more HP.

5339
05:26:16,160 --> 05:26:16,540
Wait.

5340
05:26:16,760 --> 05:26:17,440
Is this an Echo?

5341
05:26:19,620 --> 05:26:20,320
Oh, it is.

5342
05:26:20,420 --> 05:26:20,620
Oh.

5343
05:26:20,940 --> 05:26:23,100
I was like, wait, I don't remember this area.

5344
05:26:23,420 --> 05:26:24,940
Because it's been so long in this area.

5345
05:26:25,000 --> 05:26:27,220
I actually forgot what her area looks like.

5346
05:26:27,560 --> 05:26:29,100
I was like, this is an Echo.

5347
05:26:29,240 --> 05:26:30,180
Oh, look, there's Echo.

5348
05:26:30,300 --> 05:26:30,900
Is that you?

5349
05:26:31,160 --> 05:26:31,940
Is that you?

5350
05:26:32,120 --> 05:26:32,680
Is that you?

5351
05:26:32,720 --> 05:26:33,320
That's me.

5352
05:26:33,920 --> 05:26:35,200
It's me, alright, Echo.

5353
05:26:35,380 --> 05:26:40,920
I don't know how come you've been assisting me, but I'm a
long way from home and could use all the help I can get

5357
05:27:11,650 --> 05:27:12,090
Nice.

5358
05:27:16,570 --> 05:27:18,090
Money, heart, and magic.

5359
05:27:18,630 --> 05:27:19,110
Or Demeter.

5360
05:27:19,890 --> 05:27:21,970
Guys, I'm worried about Demeter, though.

5361
05:27:22,070 --> 05:27:24,270
I think I'll lose a lot of my HP if I fight a boss.

5362
05:27:24,690 --> 05:27:26,150
I don't know.

5363
05:27:26,210 --> 05:27:28,070
I'm really bad at the mini boss fights.

5364
05:27:31,170 --> 05:27:31,610
Demeter?

5365
05:27:32,410 --> 05:27:33,210
Are you sure?

5366
05:27:34,050 --> 05:27:36,050
Yeah, boss here is hard, isn't it?

5367
05:27:37,150 --> 05:27:37,770
Trust the...

5368
05:27:37,770 --> 05:27:39,750
Okay, I swear to God, if I lose this run.

5369
05:27:41,030 --> 05:27:43,430
My blood is not for you.

5370
05:27:43,870 --> 05:27:44,770
I swear to you.

5371
05:27:45,550 --> 05:27:47,370
Oh, there it is.

5372
05:27:47,670 --> 05:27:48,410
There's my armor.

5373
05:27:50,830 --> 05:27:52,570
There we go.

5374
05:27:55,170 --> 05:27:56,490
My armor is, guys.

5375
05:27:56,970 --> 05:27:59,170
Guys, my armor is now gone.

5376
05:28:01,610 --> 05:28:02,250
Guys.

5377
05:28:05,070 --> 05:28:07,370
Guys, my armor is gone, guys.

5378
05:28:14,890 --> 05:28:25,770
All right, there you go Oh my god, that took up a lot I just
died, you get it back Are you serious?

5379
05:28:27,430 --> 05:28:29,330
Okay, what does that replace?

5380
05:28:32,500 --> 05:28:45,280
Oh, come on It replaces that Yeah, but it replaces my plus
six Replace is Blitz?

5381
05:28:46,160 --> 05:28:46,960
Where's Blitz?

5382
05:28:48,140 --> 05:28:50,480
No, I think it replaces this, doesn't it?

5383
05:28:52,040 --> 05:28:52,840
Oh, no, it's Blitz.

5384
05:28:53,000 --> 05:28:54,000
Oh, okay, thank God.

5385
05:28:55,140 --> 05:28:56,780
Freeze is better than Blitz, right?

5386
05:29:01,450 --> 05:29:02,350
Or Gus.

5387
05:29:04,150 --> 05:29:04,590
Okay.

5388
05:29:15,920 --> 05:29:16,960
It depends.

5389
05:29:18,620 --> 05:29:19,300
You have three?

5390
05:29:19,720 --> 05:29:21,460
I don't hold it enough, though.

5391
05:29:22,460 --> 05:29:23,760
I don't hold it enough.

5392
05:29:25,220 --> 05:29:26,240
Her boss is Blitzing.

5393
05:29:26,260 --> 05:29:26,780
is better?

5394
05:29:27,040 --> 05:29:28,380
That might as well get Gus, though.

5395
05:29:33,180 --> 05:29:34,920
I don't look at...

5396
05:29:38,120 --> 05:29:39,820
Yeah, I don't have mana regen.

5397
05:29:40,560 --> 05:29:41,660
Negative two, then.

5398
05:29:42,560 --> 05:29:43,920
Blitz is better for boss, right?

5399
05:29:46,780 --> 05:29:48,000
Oh, I don't know.

5400
05:29:50,660 --> 05:29:52,160
Is freezer Blitz better?

5401
05:29:56,200 --> 05:29:59,220
I don't have enough magic for a three, or one or two.

5402
05:29:59,920 --> 05:30:01,220
Guys, I don't have a lot of magic.

5403
05:30:01,280 --> 05:30:02,160
I have 30 magic.

5404
05:30:03,120 --> 05:30:04,100
30 or four.

5405
05:30:05,380 --> 05:30:06,900
I don't have regen too.

5406
05:30:06,980 --> 05:30:09,480
I don't have regen so I can only use those three times.

5407
05:30:13,740 --> 05:30:14,940
This is a lot for damage.

5408
05:30:15,100 --> 05:30:16,560
Okay, we'll do this then.

5409
05:30:19,780 --> 05:30:21,460
Yeah, we're going to help.

5410
05:30:21,560 --> 05:30:23,540

5411
05:30:24,540 --> 05:30:27,240

Oh, never mind.

5414
05:30:32,080 --> 05:30:32,760
I thought I had less.

5415
05:30:34,000 --> 05:30:35,460
Um, I could buy heals.

5416
05:30:35,920 --> 05:30:37,060
No, Can I afford heals?

5417
05:30:38,160 --> 05:30:40,160
I don't remember if I can afford heals.

5418
05:30:42,440 --> 05:30:43,360
I don't know.

5419
05:30:45,860 --> 05:30:46,740

5420
05:30:48,220 --> 05:30:49,440

That's true.

5422
05:30:52,280 --> 05:30:53,460
He might give more armor.

05:30:59,700 --> 05:31:01,680

Hello, Cyprus.

5484
05:36:15,420 --> 05:36:16,420
Hello, Cyprus.

5485
05:36:16,980 --> 05:36:22,760
The infernal beast that wrought such terror in the morning
fields now sits there calmly and expectantly.

5486
05:36:25,000 --> 05:36:27,020
See, now he's a good boy.

5487
05:36:29,440 --> 05:36:30,260
Stay back.

5488
05:36:30,860 --> 05:36:32,880
Why doesn't you want me to pet him?

5489
05:36:33,440 --> 05:36:34,360
Wait, Hades?

5490
05:36:35,140 --> 05:36:35,760
Or to try?

5491
05:36:36,140 --> 05:36:36,420
Dad?

5492
05:36:38,160 --> 05:36:39,600
It's dad and dad.

5493
05:36:39,840 --> 05:36:42,180
That's the Titan Lord, a lack of a decent help.

5494
05:36:44,560 --> 05:36:47,880
You... are you... the master of this beast?

5495
05:36:49,520 --> 05:36:50,940
The master of this beast?

5496
05:36:52,520 --> 05:36:56,200
Well, if I'm to be remembered, I could think of far worse
ways than that.

5497
05:36:57,200 --> 05:37:00,980
Though this beast has yet to so much to snarl like you.

5498
05:37:02,500 --> 05:37:04,300
Lord Hades, you're my...

5499
05:37:04,300 --> 05:37:04,760
Yeah!

5500
05:37:05,680 --> 05:37:06,220
Dad!

5501
05:37:07,160 --> 05:37:07,780
I'm Melinoe.

5502
05:37:08,800 --> 05:37:09,580
I'm your daughter.

5503
05:37:09,680 --> 05:37:10,340
That's me.

5504
05:37:12,980 --> 05:37:13,580
My daughter.

5505
05:37:15,140 --> 05:37:15,420
Melenui.

5506
05:37:16,840 --> 05:37:17,260
Yeah.

5507
05:37:19,100 --> 05:37:19,520
Yeah.

5508
05:37:19,720 --> 05:37:20,940
Why not?

5509
05:37:20,980 --> 05:37:22,040
I'm here to save you.

5510
05:37:22,460 --> 05:37:23,360
He'll find you and...

5511
05:37:25,380 --> 05:37:25,800
Yeah.

5512
05:37:26,160 --> 05:37:27,080
I'll beat him up.

5513
05:37:27,940 --> 05:37:29,100
He's in the area, is he not?

5514
05:37:31,180 --> 05:37:31,680
Don't worry.

5515
05:37:31,700 --> 05:37:32,520
I'll beat him up.

5516
05:37:32,540 --> 05:37:34,540
He's in my blasted house.

5517
05:37:35,580 --> 05:37:37,080
Where you were meant to be and I.

5518
05:37:38,600 --> 05:37:39,340
Look at me, daughter.

5519
05:37:40,040 --> 05:37:41,700
I cannot confront him on my own.

5520
05:37:41,780 --> 05:37:42,520
Yeah, but you're old.

5521
05:37:42,720 --> 05:37:42,900
Not me.

5522
05:37:46,580 --> 05:37:48,180
You're watched, old man.

5523
05:37:49,260 --> 05:37:50,980
Father, let me free you from these bonds.

5524
05:37:52,920 --> 05:37:53,160
Watch this.

5525
05:37:55,480 --> 05:37:57,100
Never mind, I can't free him.

5526
05:37:57,240 --> 05:37:58,600
Now get out of this place.

5527
05:37:59,400 --> 05:38:01,640
Then let me lend to you what strength I still possess.

5528
05:38:01,660 --> 05:38:02,080
Step back, old man.

5529
05:38:02,220 --> 05:38:03,080
I'll save the world.

5530
05:38:04,520 --> 05:38:05,620
Yeah, what is he gonna give me?

5531
05:38:06,020 --> 05:38:06,240
Oh.

5532
05:38:07,600 --> 05:38:12,100
Until you reach the limit when you use to summon three soul
urns around you.

5533
05:38:12,980 --> 05:38:13,980
for your rage.

5534
05:38:14,380 --> 05:38:15,100
Destroy them to destroy.

5535
05:38:15,700 --> 05:38:18,480
And your Kronos summon sphere reinforces.

5536
05:38:18,680 --> 05:38:19,120
Okay, wait.

5537
05:38:19,220 --> 05:38:20,420
That, I like that.

5538
05:38:21,160 --> 05:38:23,020
I think I'm going to get three.

5539
05:38:23,580 --> 05:38:26,260
That means I just need to fight Kronos, guys.

5540
05:38:27,160 --> 05:38:27,480
Yeah.

5541
05:38:28,940 --> 05:38:35,260
I mean, life task is safe, but I feel like three is the long
game.

5542
05:38:35,640 --> 05:38:36,580
I'll be back for you.

5543
05:38:37,260 --> 05:38:38,060
Don't be a fool.

5544
05:38:38,940 --> 05:38:39,380
Oh, shit.

5545
05:38:39,980 --> 05:38:40,880
Oh, yeah.

5546
05:38:40,940 --> 05:38:42,040
Fuck their statue.

5547
05:38:42,980 --> 05:38:53,600
right watch out if you must that's right i'm angry now all
right let me go there you go that's the ghost that's right i

5548
05:38:53,600 --> 05:38:56,220
spoke to my father and he helped me

5549
05:39:01,140 --> 05:39:04,380
oh god i'm not the sniper thing

5550
05:39:08,270 --> 05:39:21,700
god it's so far i'm trying to trying to like get to it but
oh my god are you serious I didn't see the trap.

5551
05:39:22,580 --> 05:39:24,160
The goddamn trap.

5552
05:39:27,180 --> 05:39:28,280
That's everything, right?

5553
05:39:29,420 --> 05:39:29,920
Oh, Demeter.

5554
05:39:30,800 --> 05:39:33,200
Oh, guys, I don't think I'm not going to go to Demeter.

5555
05:39:33,820 --> 05:39:34,540
No, I don't think...

5556
05:39:34,540 --> 05:39:35,020
Guys, no.

5557
05:39:35,100 --> 05:39:36,220
I think it's going to be similar.

5558
05:39:36,360 --> 05:39:38,380
Like, no, no, no.

5559
05:39:38,900 --> 05:39:40,320
I'm not risking it.

5560
05:39:40,600 --> 05:39:42,380
I'm not risking the HP, guys.

5561
05:39:42,880 --> 05:39:45,360
I cannot afford to lose HP.

5562
05:39:45,820 --> 05:39:46,540
I'm sorry.

5563
05:39:47,000 --> 05:39:49,460
I legitimately cannot afford to lose HP.

5564
05:39:49,480 --> 05:39:52,880
I need as much HP as possible.

5565
05:39:53,160 --> 05:39:54,940
I think it's the auto rats.

5566
05:39:55,060 --> 05:39:56,040
I have a feeling.

5567
05:39:56,500 --> 05:39:57,360
It's the rats.

5568
05:39:58,540 --> 05:40:01,400
I have a feeling it's them.

5569
05:40:05,540 --> 05:40:05,920
Okay.

5570
05:40:10,130 --> 05:40:10,530
All right.

5571
05:40:13,090 --> 05:40:13,770
Oh.

5572
05:40:16,970 --> 05:40:17,810
Yeah, it's a trap.

5573
05:40:17,850 --> 05:40:18,250
It's okay.

5574
05:40:18,550 --> 05:40:19,570
I'm okay.

5575
05:40:21,990 --> 05:40:24,190
Just don't get hit, Toki.

5576
05:40:25,050 --> 05:40:29,350
I guess that is a lot harder than you think, guys.

5577
05:40:33,270 --> 05:40:36,410
For some reason, that's very hard to do.

5578
05:40:41,330 --> 05:40:44,590
Oh my god, like right now.

5579
05:40:49,870 --> 05:40:50,330
Oh god.

5580
05:40:52,790 --> 05:40:54,750
Just go for these guys.

5581
05:40:57,010 --> 05:40:58,170
Where is it?

5582
05:40:58,730 --> 05:40:59,550
One last chamber?

5583
05:41:00,650 --> 05:41:01,910
Oh my god, I can't.

5584
05:41:01,970 --> 05:41:03,470
I cannot go to the meter, guys.

5585
05:41:03,670 --> 05:41:04,050
I can't.

5586
05:41:04,310 --> 05:41:05,830
I do not trust myself.

5587
05:41:06,370 --> 05:41:10,610
I need as much HP as possible, guys.

5588
05:41:11,170 --> 05:41:12,590
I really do.

5589
05:41:15,250 --> 05:41:16,830
You don't understand.

5590
05:41:17,950 --> 05:41:21,150
I am so desperate for HP.

5591
05:41:23,010 --> 05:41:24,650
It's the only way.

5592
05:41:30,230 --> 05:41:30,850
Oh, God.

5593
05:41:31,290 --> 05:41:31,730
Oh, God.

5594
05:41:35,910 --> 05:41:36,470
It's okay.

5595
05:41:36,570 --> 05:41:38,910
I have a rock slowly moving forward.

5596
05:41:41,110 --> 05:41:41,510
Okay.

5597
05:41:43,190 --> 05:41:43,830
Here you go.

5598
05:41:44,730 --> 05:41:45,990
Pressure point required.

5599
05:41:47,190 --> 05:41:47,850
Oh, hey, money.

5600
05:41:48,610 --> 05:41:49,730
Okay, but we don't really need...

5601
05:41:49,730 --> 05:41:50,650
Oh, forget me, not.

5602
05:41:52,150 --> 05:41:53,550
Uh, we don't need that much money.

5603
05:41:53,670 --> 05:41:54,710
We already have a lot of money.

5604
05:41:59,510 --> 05:42:00,250
Oh, no.

5605
05:42:01,070 --> 05:42:01,450
Oh, wait.

5606
05:42:01,610 --> 05:42:02,250
We need this.

afford one thing guys the princess's assault on her eternal

Glow!

5616
05:43:13,640 --> 05:43:14,280

5617
05:43:16,380 --> 05:43:18,160

5618
05:43:18,220 --> 05:43:18,740
Two is good.

5619
05:43:20,820 --> 05:43:21,600
It's time.

5620
05:43:24,160 --> 05:43:25,120
Two is good.

5621
05:43:28,900 --> 05:43:29,820
All right, here we go.

5622
05:43:30,780 --> 05:43:31,320
There we go.

5623
05:43:32,100 --> 05:43:33,840
We got rid of half his summons, too.

5624
05:43:34,160 --> 05:43:35,100
Look, there's only three.

5625
05:43:36,140 --> 05:43:37,220
Happens if I pause.

5626
05:43:38,780 --> 05:43:40,520
You were telling me to pause.

5627
05:43:40,900 --> 05:43:42,480
To throw my fingers before.

5628
05:43:43,200 --> 05:43:47,560
Only to return and give to me another opportunity to add you
to my collection.

5629
05:43:47,580 --> 05:43:48,780
Oh, I could have got the other pot.

5630
05:43:48,960 --> 05:43:49,900
I forgot about it.

5631
05:43:50,500 --> 05:43:52,540
Truly get all the wisdom in our family.

5632
05:43:53,300 --> 05:43:54,980
I could have bought one more pot, guys.

5633
05:43:55,960 --> 05:43:56,440
Just...

5634
05:43:57,840 --> 05:43:58,800
Your collection.

5635
05:43:59,540 --> 05:44:01,480
I just wanted to fight him so bad.

5636
05:44:01,800 --> 05:44:02,780
You don't understand.

5637
05:44:03,280 --> 05:44:06,060
The gods ought to put you on display after cutting you to
pieces.

5638
05:44:06,100 --> 05:44:06,660
That's right.

5639
05:44:06,660 --> 05:44:09,000
Or separate you in pieces.

5640
05:44:10,000 --> 05:44:11,380
Like how to get away with murder.

5641
05:44:11,680 --> 05:44:13,740
I'm still rather sore about all that.

5642
05:44:14,680 --> 05:44:16,800
I truly thought my children would be different.

5643
05:44:17,500 --> 05:44:20,040
That they would show their elders some respect.

5644
05:44:20,860 --> 05:44:21,700
But they did not.

5645
05:44:22,440 --> 05:44:23,420
And my tolerance.

5646
05:44:23,420 --> 05:44:24,840
Get with the time zone, man.

5647
05:44:25,100 --> 05:44:26,440
The youth is now.

5648
05:44:28,140 --> 05:44:28,760
Like here.

5649
05:44:29,860 --> 05:44:31,760
Or like in the middle, midder.

5650
05:44:34,080 --> 05:44:34,900
Oh, shit.

5651
05:44:35,060 --> 05:44:35,680
I'm fucking up there.

5652
05:44:37,680 --> 05:44:38,660
My bad.

5653
05:44:44,540 --> 05:44:45,620
Oh god.

5654
05:44:48,420 --> 05:44:50,760
Oh god, I need to be careful from this guy.

5655
05:44:53,560 --> 05:44:54,560
Oh god!

5656
05:44:54,880 --> 05:44:55,440
Okay, nice.

5657
05:44:55,820 --> 05:44:56,600
I just missed...

5658
05:44:59,940 --> 05:45:00,480
Okay.

5659
05:45:01,220 --> 05:45:04,460
Oh my...

5660
05:45:04,460 --> 05:45:05,460
No, I do not.

5661
05:45:05,540 --> 05:45:06,480
I'm just gonna...

5662
05:45:06,480 --> 05:45:08,140
I'm just gonna chill here first.

5663
05:45:13,110 --> 05:45:18,870
Oh my god, I don't know what I don't know what that is Oh my
god, I don't know what that was

5664
05:45:22,110 --> 05:45:23,790
What the fuck

5665
05:45:29,640 --> 05:45:32,240
Oh, no, oh no, oh no, oh

5666
05:45:37,490 --> 05:45:39,030
Okay, it's fine

5667
05:45:44,990 --> 05:45:46,630
Oh, god, oh

5668
05:46:06,910 --> 05:46:13,680
god Oh god, where is he?

5669
05:46:39,960 --> 05:46:55,760
God there's no time for me to pause my brain is like so
tired oh no oh no oh no it's a second phase

5670
05:47:00,220 --> 05:47:13,380
what the same predictable result yet you persist I hate your
goal once more.

5671
05:47:15,560 --> 05:47:17,060
Again, our journey's intertwined.

5672
05:47:17,960 --> 05:47:19,320
Why did you call upon me, Princess?

5673
05:47:20,120 --> 05:47:22,980
I was going to go...

5674
05:47:22,980 --> 05:47:25,720
I realized the circle the last second.

5675
05:47:28,680 --> 05:47:29,040
Oh.

5676
05:47:30,980 --> 05:47:33,700

Unseen watcher between realms and keeper of the key to
pathways hidden even to immorality.

Why can't she just find me easier pathways?

That'd be nice.

5704
05:50:10,920 --> 05:50:12,180
Oh, I have a gift for you, though.

5705
05:50:12,820 --> 05:50:13,380
Hey, though.

5706
05:50:13,880 --> 05:50:20,240
Lord Moros, as our honor guest, we wanted you to have this
to make your stay a bit more comfortable.

5707
05:50:22,240 --> 05:50:23,380
The nectar of the gods.

5708
05:50:24,320 --> 05:50:25,100
Thank you, Princess.

5709
05:50:26,340 --> 05:50:28,720
I've not received an offering before.

5710
05:50:29,680 --> 05:50:31,160
Though I do like to come prepared.

5711
05:50:31,740 --> 05:50:33,760
So here, for me to you.

5712
05:50:34,560 --> 05:50:35,980
Oh, he's so tsundere.

5713
05:50:36,400 --> 05:50:37,240
He's like, oh my gosh.

5714
05:50:37,780 --> 05:50:39,260
I've never got a gift before.

5715
05:50:41,620 --> 05:50:42,560
That's cute.

5716
05:50:43,920 --> 05:50:45,540
Oh, our new stuff.

5717
05:50:46,500 --> 05:50:47,020
Where's Psyche?

5718
05:50:47,760 --> 05:50:51,040
I'll have to see how much Kronos still loves his gold after
all this.

5719
05:50:51,880 --> 05:50:55,120
The good thing about traitors is their loyalties can be
bought.

5720
05:50:57,100 --> 05:50:57,500
All right.

5721
05:50:57,760 --> 05:50:58,240
Yay.

5722
05:50:59,700 --> 05:51:00,460
Psyche, Tad.

5723
05:51:00,680 --> 05:51:01,220
Still added.

5724
05:51:01,960 --> 05:51:08,680
They're saying you got all the way to Tartarus, damn right
how far did you get make it all the way back that's right i

5725
05:51:08,680 --> 05:51:20,380
did yeah i fought i fought the old man twice at this point
he was waiting within just as expected and was strong just

5726
05:51:20,380 --> 05:51:27,480
as expected to okay he he could have been weaker if this if
there was this one girl that didn't fucking show up he could

5727
05:51:27,480 --> 05:51:30,620
have been a lot weaker well can't fault you for

5728
05:51:34,360 --> 05:51:35,020
Buffed him!

5729
05:51:36,360 --> 05:51:38,040
If that hasn't happened already.

5730
05:51:40,320 --> 05:51:42,280
Some more buffed this guy.

5731
05:51:42,480 --> 05:51:45,040
So, there's a bit of a new wrinkle in our plans.

5732
05:51:45,700 --> 05:51:51,540
We've been able to verify some of the details that Master
Hermie suggested to you about what's brewing on the surface.

5733
05:51:54,280 --> 05:51:55,400
Please tell me what you may.

5734
05:51:56,140 --> 05:52:00,280
And if you think it wise for me to deviate from my objective
to address whatever's going on up there.

5735
05:52:04,040 --> 05:52:10,500
on olympus through a channel cut across the land you're
poised to disrupt the enemy ranks from within aid olympus

5736
05:52:10,500 --> 05:52:17,540
and your chances against chronos may improve that's not what
i've been doing oh the warded pathway leading up should drop

5737
05:52:17,540 --> 05:52:26,320
me right into the heart of our foes forward garrison it
seems so reckless call it a calculated risk all right this

5738
05:52:26,320 --> 05:52:35,640
is fire this is fire i should be able to increase my grasp
oh yeah i can all in the mind more grasp What can I get?

5739
05:52:36,180 --> 05:52:39,820
And one chance this night to turn any minor fine to be a
major fine.

5740
05:52:44,890 --> 05:52:45,930
Such as...

5741
05:52:45,930 --> 05:52:46,510
Oh, okay.

5742
05:52:46,630 --> 05:52:47,610
That doesn't really matter.

5743
05:52:48,750 --> 05:52:50,390
At least two curses from two.

5744
05:52:55,060 --> 05:52:56,040
Oh, no.

5745
05:52:56,640 --> 05:52:57,640
The boatman?

5746
05:52:59,460 --> 05:53:00,540
I guess so.

5747
05:53:00,600 --> 05:53:01,680
I guess I can have more money.

5748
05:53:03,800 --> 05:53:05,180
Don't have enough just yet.

5749
05:53:06,320 --> 05:53:08,240
Okay, I'll get more money.

5750
05:53:09,580 --> 05:53:09,920
Oh.

5751
05:53:09,940 --> 05:53:10,980
Use more cards.

5752
05:53:11,100 --> 05:53:11,940
Oh, I can have more cards.

5753
05:53:15,280 --> 05:53:16,080
Oh, yeah.

5754
05:53:16,320 --> 05:53:16,740
No use.

5755
05:53:18,340 --> 05:53:19,420
I'm at my limit.

5756
05:53:19,720 --> 05:53:20,480
No, I can't.

5757
05:53:20,540 --> 05:53:21,760
Fucking liars.

5758
05:53:24,980 --> 05:53:26,460
Got them liars.

5759
05:53:28,840 --> 05:53:29,460
I can't.

5760
05:53:34,230 --> 05:53:35,290
I need three.

5761
05:53:44,950 --> 05:53:45,890
I don't know.

5762
05:53:47,930 --> 05:53:49,170
I need three.

5763
05:53:49,650 --> 05:53:50,530
I need this.

5764
05:53:50,550 --> 05:53:53,070
I can't quite grasp this one.

5765
05:53:56,230 --> 05:53:57,570
God, this is so good, though.

5766
05:54:04,230 --> 05:54:06,810
Ah, I need...

5767
05:54:06,810 --> 05:54:08,450
I don't think...

5768
05:54:08,450 --> 05:54:09,410
Yeah, I'm not...

5769
05:54:09,410 --> 05:54:10,550
I'm not going to risk it.

5770
05:54:10,790 --> 05:54:11,610
Do I have enough...

5771
05:54:11,610 --> 05:54:12,550
Wait, do I have enough?

5772
05:54:14,290 --> 05:54:15,270
Let's see.

5773
05:54:17,210 --> 05:54:18,550
Oh, yeah, psyche.

5774
05:54:24,120 --> 05:54:25,620
Let's keep buying psyche.

5775
05:54:27,340 --> 05:54:28,060
Do I have enough?

5776
05:54:33,500 --> 05:54:36,960

5781
05:55:20,930 --> 05:55:29,750
reside shades and spirits of all sorts some resembling their
mortal selves and others rendered down to purest essences

5782
05:55:29,750 --> 05:55:40,690
your have you seen commander lord carron's come to visit us
at last our supply lines are secure We're doing it.

5783
05:55:41,130 --> 05:55:45,190
It's been quite some time since good Lord Karan visited us
last.

5784
05:55:45,730 --> 05:55:47,510
We'd better all be on our best behavior.

5785
05:55:48,390 --> 05:55:50,870
Finally visits us instead of me visiting him.

5786
05:55:51,210 --> 05:55:52,130
Supply line stuff.

5787
05:55:52,310 --> 05:55:52,710
All right, guys.

5788
05:55:52,890 --> 05:55:54,730
I need to get some water.

5789
05:55:55,010 --> 05:55:55,690
He told me himself.

5790
05:55:55,690 --> 05:55:56,070
So we're good.

5791
05:55:56,150 --> 05:55:57,850
You guys are going to chill here with Skelly real quick.

5792
05:55:57,950 --> 05:55:58,450
I'll be back.

5793
05:55:58,810 --> 05:55:59,990
I'm going to get water real quick.

5794
05:56:00,190 --> 05:56:01,030
I ran out of water.

5795
05:59:05,400 --> 05:59:06,080
Right, I'm back.

5796
05:59:06,800 --> 05:59:07,280
I am back.

5797
05:59:07,280 --> 05:59:08,800
I will kill the old man.

5798
05:59:09,320 --> 05:59:09,980
This is it.

5799
05:59:10,240 --> 05:59:11,120
This is the rhyme!

5800
05:59:14,540 --> 05:59:17,200
I also peed, so...

5801
05:59:17,200 --> 05:59:17,400
Yay!

5802
05:59:19,300 --> 05:59:19,900
There you go.

5803
05:59:20,580 --> 05:59:20,780
This is it.

5804
05:59:20,880 --> 05:59:21,440
This is the rhyme.

5805
05:59:22,500 --> 05:59:23,660
Death to Kronos!

5806
05:59:24,360 --> 05:59:26,960
Papa, Rice, Mike, and Seven to give a super chat.

5807
05:59:27,180 --> 05:59:27,940
Thank you, thank you.

5808
05:59:28,540 --> 05:59:29,400
This is it!

5809
05:59:33,110 --> 05:59:37,790
I know it's on an easy trip or even possible for you right
now heading all the way up here, but just imagine how hard

5810
05:59:37,790 --> 05:59:39,970
it is for our family to swallow our bride and ask a raid.

5811
05:59:40,310 --> 05:59:40,990
Things are that grim.

5812
05:59:42,310 --> 05:59:42,710
Really?

5813
05:59:43,690 --> 05:59:45,330
That'd be that bad.

5814
05:59:51,560 --> 05:59:53,200
Okay, this is bullshit.

5815
05:59:53,860 --> 05:59:55,700
The third one was actually bullshit.

5816
05:59:58,860 --> 05:59:59,340
Uh...

5817
05:59:59,340 --> 06:00:04,400
I don't know.

5818
06:00:04,600 --> 06:00:10,200
It gave me... I collected so many wounds, and all I got was
2.5%.

5819
06:00:10,200 --> 06:00:11,240
I'll grab that.

5820
06:00:11,280 --> 06:00:12,200
I'll try this.

5821
06:00:12,760 --> 06:00:14,660
That's why I was like, that shit was bullshit.

5822
06:00:16,280 --> 06:00:18,380
I thought I would get more, you know?

5823
06:00:27,420 --> 06:00:32,120
Yeah All right Nice

5824
06:00:35,180 --> 06:00:49,540
It's fine All right, let's go We're so good at this game now
This is baby shit Mine Mine Oh, hey Oh, let's go to the head

5825
06:00:49,540 --> 06:00:56,960
Actually, oh, Poseidon for the I should have went for the
Gamba That's my bad I forgot about the Gamma.

5826
06:00:59,620 --> 06:01:01,800
I don't know how I can fuck that up.

5827
06:01:04,420 --> 06:01:06,300
Okay, that was awkward.

5828
06:01:10,560 --> 06:01:11,380
It's bad.

5829
06:01:15,920 --> 06:01:16,880
Alright, hefty.

5830
06:01:17,600 --> 06:01:19,760
So, you're a witch or something I'm to understand?

5831
06:01:20,420 --> 06:01:21,520
What do you need me for?

5832
06:01:21,980 --> 06:01:24,840
They have that fancy magic of yours and all it's cracked up
to be.

5833
06:01:25,420 --> 06:01:27,380
My work, witchy, is reliable.

5834
06:01:31,060 --> 06:01:32,120
It was one, right?

5835
06:01:32,740 --> 06:01:33,700
One was the really...

5836
06:01:33,700 --> 06:01:33,980
Yeah.

5837
06:01:36,300 --> 06:01:39,860
If it was near after your dash, you can cause a blast or
deal 200.

5838
06:01:40,060 --> 06:01:40,240
Wait.

5839
06:01:41,120 --> 06:01:41,960
Or two.

5840
06:01:43,800 --> 06:01:47,080
But then this also has, like, the 200 damage in the area.

5841
06:01:47,280 --> 06:01:48,700
They're both pretty good.

5842
06:01:50,900 --> 06:01:52,640
Also, Captain, they give us super chat.

5843
06:01:52,680 --> 06:01:52,920
Thank you.

5844
06:01:53,060 --> 06:01:53,620

Alright.

5850
06:02:34,000 --> 06:02:35,680
God, I can do this in my sleep.

5851
06:02:36,180 --> 06:02:43,220
When Bright Apollo gathered us and announced that his twin
sister was out hunting for our enemies, stumbled upon a

5852
06:02:43,220 --> 06:02:45,520
long-lost relative with the Witch of the Crossroads.

5853
06:02:45,640 --> 06:02:46,140
Like me.

5854
06:02:46,720 --> 06:02:49,320
I was overjoyed and furious at once.

5855
06:02:52,180 --> 06:02:53,100
Yeah, that's me.

5856
06:02:53,260 --> 06:02:53,620
Oh, God.

5857
06:02:53,780 --> 06:02:54,020
Nice.

5858
06:02:55,420 --> 06:02:55,680
This is it.

5859
06:02:55,780 --> 06:02:56,380
This is the run.

5860
06:02:57,300 --> 06:02:58,340
This is the run we have!

5861
06:02:58,960 --> 06:02:58,960
Freeze!

5862
06:03:01,120 --> 06:03:02,800
Uh, this has steel 35%.

5863
06:03:02,800 --> 06:03:03,840
Okay, we're saving money.

5864
06:03:04,760 --> 06:03:05,900
Uh, let's get nectar.

5865
06:03:06,280 --> 06:03:08,800
There's like people we have to gift that haven't been able
to gift yet.

5866
06:03:08,860 --> 06:03:09,820
What's she doing here?

5867
06:03:09,900 --> 06:03:11,160
Yeah, wait, what is she doing here?

5868
06:03:11,260 --> 06:03:11,860
Wait, friend?

5869
06:03:12,020 --> 06:03:13,180
One word of this to Hekken.

5870
06:03:15,640 --> 06:03:17,260
I'll go on while I take care of things.

5871
06:03:17,380 --> 06:03:18,100
Oh, friend!

5872
06:03:18,980 --> 06:03:20,860
This is my task, not yours.

5873
06:03:21,520 --> 06:03:23,820

Fine little piece there.

those writhing woods That's what I don't like that's the one

5918
06:06:09,720 --> 06:06:11,380
thing I don't like it's just that it's

5919
06:06:14,500 --> 06:06:22,520
Oh shit whoops that was an accident but I'll take that
Because it's so hard to see the attacks that's the only

5920
06:06:22,520 --> 06:06:23,640
thing I have issues with

5948
06:07:48,680 --> 06:07:54,420
I When I created life, I had my doubts.

5949
06:07:54,940 --> 06:07:57,040
Would it invite more problems than it solved?

5950
06:07:57,600 --> 06:08:03,080
I would be curious to see Thus my experiment continues to
unfold its outcome.

5951
06:08:03,460 --> 06:08:04,060

06:14:04,450 --> 06:14:05,590
This is so sad.

6053
06:14:10,080 --> 06:14:11,440
Alright, that's fine.

6054
06:14:15,840 --> 06:14:16,360
I was here.

6055
06:14:16,820 --> 06:14:17,080
Whoops.

6056
06:14:20,460 --> 06:14:21,100
Fight?

6057
06:14:24,550 --> 06:14:24,770
Okay.

6058
06:14:26,410 --> 06:14:27,490
Ah, fuck!

6059
06:14:27,790 --> 06:14:30,250
Okay, it's no longer fight.

6060
06:14:31,090 --> 06:14:33,430
Oh my god, my poor sheep body.

6061
06:14:34,450 --> 06:14:35,470
Oh my god.

6062
06:14:36,550 --> 06:14:37,950
My poor sheep body.

6063
06:14:39,290 --> 06:14:40,790
I'm trying so hard.

6064
06:14:44,230 --> 06:14:44,990
You know, fuck you.

6065
06:14:45,870 --> 06:14:47,190
Oh my god, are you serious?

6066
06:14:51,510 --> 06:14:52,470
It's fine.

6067
06:14:55,390 --> 06:14:57,990
My god, I wish I had other attacks.

6068
06:15:02,970 --> 06:15:04,890
Must be nice.

6069
06:15:09,240 --> 06:15:10,000
There we go.

6070
06:15:13,620 --> 06:15:15,040
It's okay, we did it.

6071
06:15:15,280 --> 06:15:17,400
We've completed another SAT test.

6072
06:15:18,020 --> 06:15:19,900
May they strengthen your craft.

6073
06:15:23,280 --> 06:15:23,840
Yay!

6074
06:15:24,540 --> 06:15:26,420
We did it.

6075
06:15:27,120 --> 06:15:30,220
Okay, now I should have the thing gone.

6076
06:15:30,840 --> 06:15:31,680
Is it gone now?

6077
06:15:32,500 --> 06:15:32,940
Nice.

6078
06:15:35,340 --> 06:15:36,940
What did it even do?

6079
06:15:38,100 --> 06:15:38,860
Where did it...

6080
06:15:38,860 --> 06:15:40,860
Okay, I fucking don't even know where it imbued it.

6081
06:15:40,880 --> 06:15:41,580
He's back.

6082
06:15:41,980 --> 06:15:43,780
Oh my god, why are you back?

6083
06:15:44,080 --> 06:15:46,660
You, my girl, are meddling in matters you do not understand.

6084
06:15:47,120 --> 06:15:49,420
Your father made certain choices.

6085
06:15:50,160 --> 06:15:52,860
He was bound by them, but you are not.

6086
06:15:53,460 --> 06:15:54,280
Oh, okay.

6087
06:15:55,320 --> 06:15:57,880
Oh, so I don't get punished for what my dad did?

6088
06:15:58,120 --> 06:15:58,400
Yay!

6089
06:15:59,540 --> 06:16:01,860
You brought ruin to the underworld and the surface.

6090
06:16:02,760 --> 06:16:03,980
I'll never accept what you've done.

6091
06:16:04,120 --> 06:16:04,620
Oh, okay.

6092
06:16:05,100 --> 06:16:06,760
I mean, I could have just walked away.

6093
06:16:07,040 --> 06:16:08,440
Like, I'm not part of the problem.

6094
06:16:08,580 --> 06:16:10,260
How very spirited.

6095
06:16:11,240 --> 06:16:13,620
You truly think you can stop time.

6096
06:16:14,740 --> 06:16:15,160
Well, then.

6097
06:16:15,820 --> 06:16:17,660
I would like to see you try.

6098
06:16:19,700 --> 06:16:20,900
Oh, we're free of debt.

6099
06:16:21,520 --> 06:16:22,920

Okay, we're gonna wait here.

6118
06:18:26,130 --> 06:18:27,370
Oh, it's chaos.

6119
06:18:27,670 --> 06:18:28,390
Okay, I'll buy something.

6120
06:18:28,510 --> 06:18:29,510
Oh, I do have enough money.

Okay, that's fine.

6125
06:18:41,330 --> 06:18:41,930
Okay.

6126
06:18:44,090 --> 06:18:44,690

06:18:47,350 --> 06:18:50,390
I fucked, guys, I fucked up the math.

6128
06:18:53,510 --> 06:18:56,990
I messed up the calculations somehow.

6129
06:18:58,570 --> 06:18:59,430
It's scorch, right?

6130
06:19:00,050 --> 06:19:00,970
Pyro technique?

6131
06:19:02,390 --> 06:19:03,650

06:19:08,050 --> 06:19:09,570
I'll do three.

6133
06:19:14,080 --> 06:19:17,000
I'll do three, and then we'll go down to chaos.

6134
06:19:17,860 --> 06:19:19,020
I think, all right, I do chaos.

6135
06:19:20,260 --> 06:19:21,580
God, 18?

6136
06:19:23,620 --> 06:19:24,660
Hello, I'm back.

6137
06:19:47,390 --> 06:19:47,930
Three, right?

6138
06:19:50,570 --> 06:19:53,150
Yeah, but like, I don't use my magic.

6139
06:19:54,210 --> 06:19:55,030
I don't...

6140
06:19:55,030 --> 06:19:56,530
Yeah, oh, man.

6141
06:19:56,830 --> 06:19:59,630
But it's great if I use magic, though.

6143
06:20:04,730 --> 06:20:05,510

06:20:19,580 --> 06:20:20,400
Oh my!

6147
06:20:22,100 --> 06:20:23,660

6148
06:20:23,980 --> 06:20:24,300
Okay.

6149
06:20:25,620 --> 06:20:27,700
Ah, shit!

6150
06:20:29,460 --> 06:20:30,760
It's okay, guys.

6151
06:20:31,080 --> 06:20:32,460
We don't need...

6152
06:20:32,460 --> 06:20:33,720
We resisted it.

6153
06:20:34,820 --> 06:20:37,560
The mistakes might have been made.

6154
06:20:38,880 --> 06:20:40,540
It's okay.

6155
06:20:40,720 --> 06:20:41,420
Thank you.

6156
06:20:43,540 --> 06:20:45,500

06:20:48,320 --> 06:20:49,560
I can speak.

6160
06:20:49,580 --> 06:20:50,080
I can still dash.

6161
06:20:50,420 --> 06:20:51,400
I can still dash.

6162
06:20:52,560 --> 06:20:53,760
Got some blasted deals.

06:21:05,000 --> 06:21:06,220
One seems good.

6166
06:21:07,640 --> 06:21:09,720
When you next take damage, revive.

6167
06:21:10,440 --> 06:21:12,280

06:25:38,120 --> 06:25:40,560
Oh my god, oh my god, okay, that's fine, that's fine, that's
fine.

6231
06:25:40,940 --> 06:25:42,300
How did that hit me?

6232
06:25:46,340 --> 06:25:47,520
Oh god, that was close.

6233
06:25:57,050 --> 06:25:57,490
Okay.

6234
06:25:59,210 --> 06:26:00,070
Your turn!

6235
06:26:02,190 --> 06:26:03,650
Just you left, girl!

6236
06:26:06,450 --> 06:26:08,150
Oh my god, I'm tanking everything.

6237
06:26:08,670 --> 06:26:10,650
Oh my god, I never learned.

6238
06:26:13,490 --> 06:26:14,290
Jesus Christ.

6239
06:26:15,890 --> 06:26:16,950
Oh, I did it.

6240
06:26:18,090 --> 06:26:18,430
Oh!

6241
06:26:24,040 --> 06:26:26,620
I hate when she summons all those little fishies.

6242
06:26:26,780 --> 06:26:27,720
It, like, throws me off.

6243
06:26:27,820 --> 06:26:28,640
Because the fire?

6244
06:26:29,100 --> 06:26:31,820
The fire is so bad with the little fishies, I feel like.

6245
06:26:32,640 --> 06:26:33,700
Just not as good.

6246
06:26:35,480 --> 06:26:48,160

career that's right i said it okay nice i need the heals you

happy she's not here anymore Like, oh, fuck, I didn't see

6249
06:27:05,280 --> 06:27:06,600
the little shoddy thing.

6250
06:27:07,340 --> 06:27:07,960
It's so tiny.

6251
06:27:08,080 --> 06:27:09,320
The circle is so tiny.

6252
06:27:09,440 --> 06:27:10,740
How was I supposed to know?

6253
06:27:11,620 --> 06:27:13,420
Oh, my God, the goddamn roots.

6254
06:27:18,090 --> 06:27:18,550
Okay.

6255
06:27:20,810 --> 06:27:21,270
Boop.

6256
06:27:22,950 --> 06:27:26,390
Okay, I'm gonna get rid of the Medusa's at least.

6257
06:27:27,410 --> 06:27:27,930
There we go.

6258
06:27:29,050 --> 06:27:29,370
Oh, wait.

6259
06:27:29,590 --> 06:27:31,170
I might as well grab this, too.

6260
06:27:32,230 --> 06:27:32,950
I'm at it.

6261
06:27:34,370 --> 06:27:34,830
Fire!

6262
06:27:35,210 --> 06:27:36,070
Fire bad!

6263
06:27:36,270 --> 06:27:45,530
into the purse I bid you shine for me again tonight yes
Selene I descended into Tartarus and must have seen what

6264
06:27:45,530 --> 06:27:53,670
Kronos made of that most Selene I know your confrontation
did not go as you desired but this is a new night and you

6265
06:27:53,670 --> 06:28:05,010

Tarka area that's your launches that inflicts more fun up to

6266

6267
06:28:09,660 --> 06:28:11,680
60% then turn into a harmless critter.

6268
06:28:11,940 --> 06:28:12,820
Last four seconds.

6269
06:28:13,000 --> 06:28:13,180
Oh.

6270
06:28:15,920 --> 06:28:16,760
Want curse?

6271
06:28:21,000 --> 06:28:22,820
Yeah, but it's like one, right?

6272
06:28:24,300 --> 06:28:25,720
Does it work on bosses?

6273
06:28:36,200 --> 06:28:37,560
Does it work on bosses?

6274
06:28:39,800 --> 06:28:40,240
No?

6275
06:28:40,500 --> 06:28:42,620
Then what the fuck am I going to use it for?

6276
06:28:44,800 --> 06:28:46,720
The fuck am I going to use it for?

6277
06:28:50,040 --> 06:28:52,880
All right, we're gonna do one then.

6278
06:28:59,090 --> 06:29:01,690
That's bullshit if it doesn't work on bosses.

6279
06:29:02,710 --> 06:29:04,130
It's good, though.

6280
06:29:08,910 --> 06:29:09,770
Crowd clearing?

6281
06:29:10,810 --> 06:29:11,290
Too late.

6282
06:29:15,000 --> 06:29:15,760
Or is it even two?

6283
06:29:15,800 --> 06:29:17,300
I don't even remember what two was.

6284
06:29:20,180 --> 06:29:21,900
I wasted that.

6285
06:29:23,780 --> 06:29:24,620
No, I...

6286
06:29:26,220 --> 06:29:26,740
Boom!

6287
06:29:32,510 --> 06:29:34,150
That's why I don't want to get near these guys.

6288
06:29:38,420 --> 06:29:39,180
That's right.

6289
06:29:40,540 --> 06:29:41,060
Boom!

6290
06:29:42,820 --> 06:29:44,160
Alright, now we got the hammer.

6291
06:29:49,920 --> 06:29:52,780
Your attack hits two, but uses plus five.

6292
06:29:53,600 --> 06:29:54,920
It has more range.

6293
06:29:55,640 --> 06:29:55,820
Five.

6294
06:29:56,120 --> 06:29:58,260
Oh, no, we like the range on my special.

6295
06:29:58,980 --> 06:29:59,780
One or two?

6296
06:30:01,580 --> 06:30:02,280
Good old two?

6297
06:30:03,520 --> 06:30:04,160
Or one?

6298
06:30:05,960 --> 06:30:07,300
I don't have...

6299
06:30:07,300 --> 06:30:08,480
Do I have mana recharge?

6300
06:30:09,940 --> 06:30:11,020
I do, right?

6301
06:30:11,540 --> 06:30:12,740
I think I do.

6302
06:30:17,500 --> 06:30:18,580
I do not.

6303
06:30:20,000 --> 06:30:20,600
I do?

6304
06:30:22,300 --> 06:30:23,540
Oh, I have Aphrodite.

6305
06:30:23,680 --> 06:30:24,900
Oh, I do, yeah.

6306
06:30:26,320 --> 06:30:27,800
So I should do this then.

6307
06:30:29,720 --> 06:30:31,820
Oh, but I do use this a lot, too.

6308
06:30:31,960 --> 06:30:32,920
Okay, we'll do this.

6309
06:30:33,760 --> 06:30:35,380
Such secrets in this stuff.

6310
06:30:35,880 --> 06:30:37,040
Oh, we don't get...

6311
06:30:37,040 --> 06:30:37,280
Oh.

6312
06:30:38,000 --> 06:30:40,220
Yeah, I'm not fucking, I don't know, I don't know, guys.

6313
06:30:40,600 --> 06:30:41,020
I don't,

6314
06:30:45,420 --> 06:30:46,180
I don't know.

6315
06:30:46,820 --> 06:30:48,400
What if it's, oh, again?

6316
06:30:50,080 --> 06:30:51,080
I don't know.

6317
06:30:52,420 --> 06:30:52,940
Is it?

6318
06:30:54,240 --> 06:30:56,460
What if it's there again?

6319
06:30:58,140 --> 06:30:59,480
Let me post.

6320
06:30:59,680 --> 06:31:00,840
Okay, we'll try this.

6321
06:31:01,500 --> 06:31:02,280
Oh my god.

6322
06:31:02,880 --> 06:31:03,820
Oh my god.

6323
06:31:03,960 --> 06:31:04,780
Oh my god.

6324
06:31:04,980 --> 06:31:05,660
No, okay.

6325
06:31:05,800 --> 06:31:07,140
No, this was, I regret.

6326
06:31:08,000 --> 06:31:08,740
regret.

6327
06:31:09,980 --> 06:31:12,220
Oh, fuck you.

6328
06:31:13,840 --> 06:31:15,320
No, I regret.

6329
06:31:17,080 --> 06:31:17,720
I regret.

6330
06:31:18,960 --> 06:31:21,460
I absolutely regret this.

6331
06:31:26,570 --> 06:31:27,890
Oh, my God.

6332
06:31:32,240 --> 06:31:32,600
Okay.

6333
06:31:33,440 --> 06:31:33,680
Okay.

6334
06:31:34,000 --> 06:31:37,360
That's a lot of my HP gone, but we did it.

6335
06:31:39,020 --> 06:31:41,560
Oh, shit.

6336
06:31:42,540 --> 06:31:44,820
Oh, deal damage and remove scorch?

6337
06:31:45,000 --> 06:31:45,720
Okay, wait.

6338
06:31:47,420 --> 06:31:49,620
Whenever you deal damage...

6339
06:31:49,620 --> 06:31:53,280
Whenever you inflict freeze on foe, deal damage and remove
scorch.

6340
06:31:53,380 --> 06:31:53,860
Wait, what?

6341
06:31:55,260 --> 06:31:56,020
Is it worth that?

6342
06:31:56,680 --> 06:31:57,580
That's worth it, right?

6343
06:32:00,560 --> 06:32:01,040
Okay.

6344
06:32:02,560 --> 06:32:03,420
Oh, shit, nice!

6345
06:32:04,260 --> 06:32:05,360
We get Hestia again.

You channel your cast faster and your cast expires faster.

6376
06:34:33,100 --> 06:34:33,940
I don't like that.

6377
06:34:34,360 --> 06:34:35,660
Any number gain is worth more.

6394
06:35:26,720 --> 06:35:27,740

06:35:28,080 --> 06:35:29,440
Okay, there's that.

6396
06:35:30,320 --> 06:35:31,160
Okay, Aphrodite.

6404
06:35:46,020 --> 06:35:46,980
Can't do shit now.

6405
06:35:47,740 --> 06:35:48,360
That's right.

6406
06:35:48,760 --> 06:35:49,360
Get frozen.

6407
06:35:50,020 --> 06:35:50,580
Oh, nope.

6408
06:35:51,640 --> 06:35:53,200
Black Spark's coming in.

6409
06:35:55,460 --> 06:35:56,240
It's okay.

6410
06:35:58,680 --> 06:36:02,600
I don't know where he is, but surely he can't kill me here.

6411
06:36:05,980 --> 06:36:07,080
Still have my armor, too.

6412
06:36:09,220 --> 06:36:09,740
Oh, shit.

6413
06:36:09,980 --> 06:36:12,400
Okay, your blast effects also creates a heartthrob.

6414
06:36:14,540 --> 06:36:16,160
That orb is surrounding burst when hit.

6415
06:36:16,220 --> 06:36:17,520
Oh, yeah, love handles.

6416
06:36:17,780 --> 06:36:18,400
Let's go.

6417
06:36:18,740 --> 06:36:19,840
Husband and wife duo.

6418
06:36:20,420 --> 06:36:20,960
Let's go.

6419
06:36:21,100 --> 06:36:21,960
Can't be that bad.

6420
06:36:25,320 --> 06:36:26,320
Oh my god.

6421
06:36:26,780 --> 06:36:27,420
Oh my god.

6422
06:36:27,820 --> 06:36:29,360
What the fuck?

6423
06:36:29,980 --> 06:36:31,620
What is that?

6424
06:36:38,240 --> 06:36:40,340
What the fuck was that?

6425
06:36:44,200 --> 06:36:44,540
Oh my god.

6426
06:36:44,920 --> 06:36:45,740
Get this guy out of here.

6427
06:36:46,200 --> 06:36:47,080
Get this guy out of here.

6428
06:36:47,260 --> 06:36:47,660
Oh my god.

6429
06:36:47,860 --> 06:36:48,600
Get him out of here.

6430
06:36:51,220 --> 06:36:51,680
Okay.

6431
06:36:52,260 --> 06:36:52,780
There you go.

6432
06:36:53,700 --> 06:36:55,300
Where the fuck did this guy come from?

6433
06:36:55,360 --> 06:36:56,540
I never seen him before.

6434
06:36:56,860 --> 06:36:57,980
You should be able to get out, I think.

6435
06:37:01,920 --> 06:37:03,480
Oh, I'm going to get a shot.

6436
06:37:03,880 --> 06:37:04,440
I need HP.

6437
06:37:09,740 --> 06:37:11,080
Okay, food.

6438
06:37:13,020 --> 06:37:13,880
I need you.

6439
06:37:16,820 --> 06:37:20,520
You can cause every blast effects also inflict glow.

6440
06:37:21,020 --> 06:37:22,880
Your attacks deal more damage to armor.

6441
06:37:23,420 --> 06:37:23,420
Fuck.

6442
06:37:25,380 --> 06:37:26,240
It's all good.

6443
06:37:26,780 --> 06:37:27,640
All of them are good.

6444
06:37:28,040 --> 06:37:28,040
Wait.

6445
06:37:29,020 --> 06:37:29,020

6446
06:37:29,340 --> 06:37:29,720
Head?

6447
06:37:29,900 --> 06:37:30,520

6454
06:37:53,220 --> 06:37:55,320
Or one for free boss damage.

6455
06:38:00,280 --> 06:38:00,680
Oh.

6456
06:38:01,320 --> 06:38:02,100

Be sued.

6496
06:40:53,960 --> 06:40:56,820
I don't understand why he keeps getting mad.

6497
06:40:57,700 --> 06:40:58,100
Tears.

6498
06:40:58,600 --> 06:40:59,200
Oh, tears.

06:40:59,420 --> 06:41:00,260

Oh, guys, it wasn't me.

Yo, keeps keeping me.

6502
06:41:06,040 --> 06:41:07,220
Good dog.

6503
06:41:07,860 --> 06:41:09,220
Back to Kronos.

6504
06:41:09,400 --> 06:41:10,340
Again!

6505
06:41:13,240 --> 06:41:15,000
Here we go again!

6506
06:41:16,520 --> 06:41:17,660
Chronos time!

6507
06:41:18,200 --> 06:41:19,600
Oh, I still can't access this, I forgot.

6508
06:41:20,940 --> 06:41:21,460
Here goes.

6509
06:41:22,680 --> 06:41:24,360
I didn't throw the buff.

6510
06:41:25,420 --> 06:41:26,180
Maintenance access.

6511
06:41:28,100 --> 06:41:29,040
Please, Ares, please.

6512
06:41:29,540 --> 06:41:31,400
Please, Ares, please, please.

6513
06:41:32,160 --> 06:41:32,420
No!

6514
06:41:36,100 --> 06:41:37,300
Fuck you!

6515
06:41:37,880 --> 06:41:39,380
Here to set another curse on me.

6516
06:41:39,400 --> 06:41:39,740
Ares.

6517
06:41:40,700 --> 06:41:44,420
For all your idiosyncrasies, I never took you for a traitor.

6518
06:41:46,000 --> 06:41:49,100
I think Ares is the worst thing they've ever added into this
game.

6519
06:41:49,480 --> 06:41:49,880
I don't understand.

6520
06:41:50,040 --> 06:41:54,560
Why haven't we like cyberbullied the devs to remove Ares?

6521
06:41:56,800 --> 06:42:00,580
By the way, disclaimer, that was a joke, guys.

6522
06:42:01,000 --> 06:42:02,020
That was a joke.

6523
06:42:02,940 --> 06:42:06,220
Do not cyberbullied the devs to remove Ares.

6524
06:42:08,120 --> 06:42:08,720
True.

6525
06:42:10,700 --> 06:42:12,480
For legal reasons.

6526
06:42:13,060 --> 06:42:14,580
That is a joke.

6527
06:42:21,140 --> 06:42:24,520
Okay, gotta go.

6528
06:42:26,240 --> 06:42:26,880

Punishing me just for being good at a video game.

and you can't take him down

06:45:01,390 --> 06:45:08,350
after you take go dark and deal more dirt damage you're in

Three is free DPS.

Okay, less HP or...

6552
06:45:38,990 --> 06:45:41,390
I feel like this would be better long-term, right?

6553
06:45:41,990 --> 06:45:42,390
Yeah.

6554
06:45:44,250 --> 06:45:45,270
You'll be avenged.

6555

Oh, yeah, this would be better long-term, yeah.

06:45:48,410 --> 06:45:49,910
Oh, I have a gift for you, Dad.

6557
06:45:50,650 --> 06:45:52,290
I don't think I gave it you a gift yet.

6558
06:45:52,350 --> 06:45:58,630
Father, while I know this wasn't necessarily permitted, I
thought if maybe it would be of any comfort at all, that I

6559
06:45:58,630 --> 06:45:59,690
might offer you this nectar.

6560
06:46:01,730 --> 06:46:03,850
Exactly like your brother, Blast.

6561
06:46:04,910 --> 06:46:07,410
I fear I'm not in any mood or state for such a thing.

6562
06:46:08,610 --> 06:46:12,610
Concerning yourself not with my comfort, but with the target
of your wrath.

6563
06:46:14,590 --> 06:46:15,230
Alright, yay!

6564
06:46:16,470 --> 06:46:17,610
Now what you pet- What?

6565
06:46:17,770 --> 06:46:22,590
Just because I call you a bad dog, I'm not allowed to pet
you?

6566
06:46:23,030 --> 06:46:24,450
God, so stubborn.

6567
06:46:25,730 --> 06:46:27,090
What the fuck did I do?

6568
06:46:28,010 --> 06:46:29,430
He started it.

6569
06:46:35,700 --> 06:46:36,420
Nice.

6570
06:46:40,320 --> 06:46:40,800
Alright.

6571
06:46:41,700 --> 06:46:42,160
Nice.

6572
06:46:42,900 --> 06:46:43,600
Okay.

6573
06:46:43,960 --> 06:46:47,580
I'm just gonna kill the ones that are frozen first.

6574
06:46:49,180 --> 06:46:49,900
Okay.

6575
06:46:52,460 --> 06:46:53,280
Yeah, I don't...

6576
06:46:53,280 --> 06:46:54,800
Oh, I don't trust these guys.

6577
06:47:01,300 --> 06:47:02,020
Boom!

6578
06:47:02,760 --> 06:47:03,040
Okay.

6579
06:47:03,600 --> 06:47:04,200
Oh my god.

6580
06:47:04,260 --> 06:47:05,500
Like, I can't see anything.

6581
06:47:06,580 --> 06:47:07,720
It's all...

6582
06:47:07,720 --> 06:47:08,660
It's all...

6583
06:47:08,660 --> 06:47:08,760

It's a lot better than 11.

6709
06:55:42,380 --> 06:55:45,900
Moving against Olympus whilst holding the underworld in his
thrall.

6710
06:55:50,840 --> 06:55:54,840
Your weak effects are more potent.

6711
06:55:55,780 --> 06:55:57,520
Okay, um...

6712
06:55:58,980 --> 06:56:02,120

07:00:19,060 --> 07:00:19,980
It's five.

6761
07:00:22,920 --> 07:00:23,840
It's five.

6762
07:00:23,840 --> 07:00:26,340
My god, it's not so five.

6763
07:00:29,880 --> 07:00:31,600
Are you fucking kidding me?

6764
07:00:31,740 --> 07:00:32,980
Okay, that's fine.

6765
07:00:33,600 --> 07:00:34,120
It's not.

6766
07:00:34,600 --> 07:00:36,500
But, oh my god.

6767
07:00:36,920 --> 07:00:38,220
It was not fine, guys.

6768
07:00:38,720 --> 07:00:40,320
It was not fine.

6769
07:00:41,720 --> 07:00:43,320
Like, I still don't know what this does.

6770
07:00:49,400 --> 07:00:50,340
Oh my god, I can't be so good.

6771
07:00:50,520 --> 07:00:50,860

6772
07:00:51,580 --> 07:00:52,060

6785
07:01:54,680 --> 07:01:55,480
Nix?

6786
07:01:56,060 --> 07:01:57,380
What's going on?

6787
07:02:00,200 --> 07:02:00,660
Nix?

6788
07:02:01,500 --> 07:02:01,940
Nix?

6789
07:02:03,160 --> 07:02:03,780
Answer me.

6790
07:02:06,260 --> 07:02:06,980
Oh, no.

6791
07:02:07,100 --> 07:02:08,340
Oh, she's time stopped.

6792
07:02:09,380 --> 07:02:09,940
She got time.

6793
07:02:10,040 --> 07:02:11,620
Wait, everybody's time stopped.

6794
07:02:11,740 --> 07:02:12,820
Hello, Hades.

6795
07:02:13,760 --> 07:02:14,040
Hello?

6796
07:02:17,120 --> 07:02:18,360
I don't just walk away.

6797
07:02:18,980 --> 07:02:19,880
Like, what the fuck?

6798
07:02:20,320 --> 07:02:20,320
Okay.

6799
07:02:20,700 --> 07:02:21,120
Okay, time.

6800
07:02:21,140 --> 07:02:22,700
There you are, my son.

6801
07:02:22,840 --> 07:02:23,620
Oh, son?

6802
07:02:24,820 --> 07:02:25,420
Oh, shit.

6803
07:02:26,460 --> 07:02:26,980
Granddaddy?

6804
07:02:27,640 --> 07:02:29,920
And now you have a family of your own.

6805
07:02:30,940 --> 07:02:34,360
How full of life they are, despite the Tao environs.

6806
07:02:36,040 --> 07:02:37,700
Oh my god, it's grandpa!

6807
07:02:38,780 --> 07:02:39,780
Oh my god, someone beat up my phone.

6808
07:02:40,060 --> 07:02:41,520
Fucking sent him to a home after this.

6809
07:02:42,100 --> 07:02:42,900
Fuck this guy.

6810
07:02:43,140 --> 07:02:45,320
I was not expecting your arrival.

6811
07:02:47,820 --> 07:02:51,900
You must forgive us that the house was unprepared for
guests.

6812
07:02:53,320 --> 07:02:55,700
To what do we owe the pleasure of your company?

6813
07:02:56,980 --> 07:02:59,520
You know, for one thing, I was in the area.

6814
07:03:00,600 --> 07:03:08,600
You might recall the time you and Zeus and the rest of you
little brats cut me to ribbons i mean you're a really bad

6815
07:03:08,600 --> 07:03:18,200
father so like like we gotta send you to a home like i'm
gonna send him back to the home that was a war you started

6816
07:03:18,200 --> 07:03:29,040
and you know it we took no put this man at home but how can
this be i thought that you were gone do you not sound so

6817
07:03:29,040 --> 07:03:35,040
disappointed it is i who should be disappointed here not you
You thought I was gone?

6818
07:03:35,340 --> 07:03:36,020
I was.

6819
07:03:36,840 --> 07:03:38,120
But it turns out spite...

6820
07:03:38,120 --> 07:03:38,800
Oh, he's like me.

6821
07:03:39,560 --> 07:03:41,000
See, I inherited that.

6822
07:03:41,240 --> 07:03:43,260
Blood sacrifices also helped.

6823
07:03:45,120 --> 07:03:46,780
What do you intend to do?

6824
07:03:47,020 --> 07:03:49,180
And what have you done to the others?

6825
07:03:49,800 --> 07:03:50,740
To my family?

6826
07:03:53,120 --> 07:03:55,240
Your cries fall on deaf ears.

6827
07:03:55,820 --> 07:03:57,040
Fear not, my son.

6828
07:03:57,720 --> 07:03:59,640
I have not eaten them or anything.

6829
07:04:00,240 --> 07:04:02,560
I have merely set them aside.

6830
07:04:03,060 --> 07:04:15,820
They stand imprisoned in a moment that that shall never pass
my qualm is not with them Olympus shall have your head you

6831
07:04:15,820 --> 07:04:21,560
can take mine for all I care blast you But don't you dare
harm anybody in my house.

6832
07:04:21,560 --> 07:04:24,140
Yeah, why does he does he have like multiple children?

6833
07:04:24,640 --> 07:04:26,760
Why the fuck is he like targeting Hades?

6834
07:04:27,800 --> 07:04:36,340
You have grown so accustomed to issuing commands that you
forget yourself do have such a command for you tell me

6835
07:04:36,340 --> 07:04:46,420
exactly where the fates reside the fates how should i know
but even nix herself knows where her daughters are he's the

6836
07:04:46,420 --> 07:04:56,040
eldest damn that's asking me yeah but he has multiple
children that join in why target he's first bro this guy

6837
07:04:56,040 --> 07:05:04,480
already bro he lives in hell like he's like he got the worst
out of all the gods he literally and he got bad he didn't

6838
07:05:04,480 --> 07:05:13,780
even want to be in hell that was Hades's lore he didn't even
want to be in hell like he's like you're assigned to hell

6839
07:05:13,780 --> 07:05:21,440
now and he's like what has my family and the fates
themselves oh Freenos oh he was trapped in oh he was

6840
07:05:21,440 --> 07:05:29,460
literally just there he was just there among the other
shades Dora you could join them for some activity out there

6841
07:05:29,460 --> 07:05:34,520
it's picked up a lot of late Foolish witch.

6842
07:05:35,180 --> 07:05:37,240
Haunting this tent is a full-time obsession.

6843
07:05:37,420 --> 07:05:39,080
We lesser shades can be a little single-minded.

6844
07:05:40,000 --> 07:05:41,000
I guess kind of like mortals.

6845
07:05:41,960 --> 07:05:43,220
Well, that's Disney Hades.

6846
07:05:43,460 --> 07:05:44,840
Wasn't there a time where, like, stuff?

6847
07:05:45,900 --> 07:05:47,280
I thought it was like the original Hades.

6848
07:05:47,560 --> 07:05:50,300
Also, like, was like, he didn't really want it to be there.

6849
07:05:52,260 --> 07:05:58,400
The widely hated, feared embodiment of doom goes wherever
the ever-weaving fates decide.

6850
07:05:59,080 --> 07:06:01,940
And none but they can anticipate his arrival.

6851
07:06:03,060 --> 07:06:04,440
like super chill.

6852
07:06:11,640 --> 07:06:15,820
Like everyone else is in Olympus and then Hades was in the
fucking underworld.

6853
07:06:16,240 --> 07:06:19,960
My task began immediately following reports that Kronos
found a way to get...

6854
07:06:19,960 --> 07:06:22,440
Yeah, he was saying he was cheated into it, but he
doesn't...

6855
07:06:22,440 --> 07:06:23,900
Yeah, he doesn't care now.

6856
07:06:24,400 --> 07:06:26,680
But like, back then, he was like, what?

6857
07:06:26,800 --> 07:06:28,160
His sisters, the three fates.

6858
07:06:28,860 --> 07:06:29,960
He got them, didn't he?

6859
07:06:30,940 --> 07:06:31,840
Is that why you're here?

6860
07:06:34,960 --> 07:06:36,740
Now, I think he just got them.

6861
07:06:37,680 --> 07:06:38,240
Yeah, did he got them?

6862
07:06:38,260 --> 07:06:45,300
I'm making clear to me that you already know I ought to have
been there when it happened Perhaps the fates knew I lacked

6863
07:06:45,300 --> 07:06:55,940
the strength to protect them So they protected me Imagine
losing the gotcha and getting it like getting the underworld

6864
07:06:57,060 --> 07:07:08,760
He's like what should we be gods of let's put your names in
the head We'll see it That's fucked It's like whoa Guys,

6865
07:07:09,240 --> 07:07:10,240
what are you gonna get?

6866
07:07:10,460 --> 07:07:12,780
Let's draw a name from a hat, guys.

6867
07:07:13,680 --> 07:07:17,780
Poseidon, you get the C, even though your name was already
related to the C.

6868
07:07:21,020 --> 07:07:23,580
You lost the two, three, and got hell.

6869
07:07:26,620 --> 07:07:27,740
How did he find them?

6870
07:07:28,620 --> 07:07:30,020
What does he want from them?

6871
07:07:30,960 --> 07:07:33,870
I don't know how he found them.

6872
07:07:34,750 --> 07:07:37,390
Few beings with knowledge of their whereabouts exist.

6873
07:07:38,430 --> 07:07:39,650
As to what he wants from them.

6874
07:07:39,730 --> 07:07:41,910
Yeah, what does he want with a fate?

6875
07:07:43,330 --> 07:07:46,230
Surely he'll try to influence their weavings from here on.

6876
07:07:48,710 --> 07:07:51,870
Oh, I'm just like, oops.

6877
07:07:52,110 --> 07:07:53,870
A fated list of minor prophecies.

6878
07:07:54,730 --> 07:07:55,810
There's a life tax?

6879
07:07:56,890 --> 07:07:57,450
Interesting.

6880
07:07:58,010 --> 07:07:59,990
Oh my god, thank fucking god.

6881
07:08:00,650 --> 07:08:01,170
Finally.

6882
07:08:02,910 --> 07:08:03,110
Finally.

6883
07:08:03,110 --> 07:08:04,270
If time cannot be stopped.

6884
07:08:04,270 --> 07:08:06,130
Oh my god, fucking finally.

6885
07:08:06,490 --> 07:08:08,190
If spill my blood, I must.

6886
07:08:08,190 --> 07:08:09,510
I can like swap it.

6887
07:08:09,730 --> 07:08:10,950
This is why it's needed.

6888
07:08:11,430 --> 07:08:12,750
So, moat it be.

6889
07:08:13,750 --> 07:08:14,970
I needed that, actually.

6890
07:08:15,370 --> 07:08:16,590
I can finally swap the thing.

6891
07:08:19,150 --> 07:08:21,630
Restore where shades and others reacted to dormant.

6892
07:08:22,210 --> 07:08:23,310
Halfway leading, eventually fought.

6893
07:08:23,490 --> 07:08:24,070
What does it do?

6894
07:08:25,870 --> 07:08:27,750
It's turning for a surplus of money.

6895
07:08:30,650 --> 07:08:32,130
Okay, we gotta get that.

6896
07:08:35,860 --> 07:08:36,980
Wait, what's warded gateways?

6897
07:08:41,600 --> 07:08:42,040
What?

6898
07:08:43,220 --> 07:08:44,460
I don't know what it actually does.

6899
07:08:44,480 --> 07:08:44,900
It does.

6900
07:08:46,320 --> 07:08:47,760
Let's grab this real quick.

6901
07:08:50,380 --> 07:08:51,580
Grab more cactos.

6902
07:08:53,520 --> 07:08:54,920
Oh, he's still asleep.

6903
07:08:55,020 --> 07:08:56,640
Will he ever wake up?

6904
07:08:57,540 --> 07:08:59,240
Oh, I have enough for this, though.

6905
07:09:04,470 --> 07:09:04,730
Yay!

6906
07:09:06,550 --> 07:09:09,210
Again, I failed to destroy the Titan, headmistress.

6907
07:09:09,990 --> 07:09:13,650
Night after night, he thwarts me, expecting I'll eventually
give in.

6908
07:09:16,390 --> 07:09:26,430
but you've no such intent correct you cannot stop him and
neither has he been able to stop you that's right to his

6909
07:09:26,430 --> 07:09:35,050
power and he can bro he's literally I swear to God I see her
again in this I swear to fucking God he's literally getting

6910
07:09:35,050 --> 07:09:41,930
saved by her every time I would have the fucking most
perfect build and then she will show up.

6911
07:09:45,850 --> 07:09:46,630
Okay, let's get Psyche.

6912
07:09:47,630 --> 07:09:49,170
Psyche is always good.

6913
07:09:50,110 --> 07:09:51,950
Back on your feet again, there, Princess.

6914
07:09:52,210 --> 07:09:53,370
I don't even know how many runs I'm in.

6915
07:09:53,510 --> 07:09:56,550
I would have fucking killed him, like, seven runs ago.

6916
07:09:57,950 --> 07:10:00,930
It's fortunate we have you vigilantly keeping watch here,
Nemesis.

6917
07:10:02,070 --> 07:10:03,450
Oh, come on, drop the act.

6918
07:10:03,890 --> 07:10:04,390
What happened?

6919
07:10:04,690 --> 07:10:05,410
When did you return?

6920
07:10:05,490 --> 07:10:05,690
Yeah.

6921
07:10:06,230 --> 07:10:07,090
When did you return?

6922
07:10:07,230 --> 07:10:08,610
I don't know what you're talking about.

6923
07:10:08,990 --> 07:10:10,430
It's not your business, anyway.

6924
07:10:11,310 --> 07:10:12,230
Fates help you.

6925
07:10:12,330 --> 07:10:14,010
You stole my fucking store.

6926
07:10:15,390 --> 07:10:17,450
Bro, everyone here is so mean of me.

6927
07:10:17,830 --> 07:10:20,090
Yet they all rely on me to save the world.

6928
07:10:20,230 --> 07:10:21,050
Be so arrogant.

07:10:24,690 --> 07:10:29,850
Our shades have proved unable to approach the house of
Hades, so they've no reports about the way the Titan fights.

6931
07:10:30,430 --> 07:10:32,110

He looks rather frail, but he's quick.

6935
07:10:38,770 --> 07:10:42,050
His side has significant reach, and he can freeze me at a
moment's notice.

Never again.

6992
07:15:27,930 --> 07:15:30,750
Watch out if Zeus turns into a Zeus.

07:15:31,230 --> 07:15:32,250
Thank you for the end.

6994
07:15:32,590 --> 07:15:33,590

Never again.

6997
07:15:42,370 --> 07:15:45,210
Don't fix what isn't broken, guys.

6998
07:15:47,210 --> 07:15:49,930
Oh my god, I already lost so much HP.

6999
07:15:50,990 --> 07:15:51,550
What?

7000
07:15:55,660 --> 07:15:57,040
I heard, like, a bing.

7001
07:15:58,100 --> 07:15:59,340
First, you need to...

7002
07:15:59,340 --> 07:16:00,860
Oh, shit, sorry, guys.

7003
07:16:01,000 --> 07:16:03,600
Maybe I should have fucking read...

7004
07:16:03,600 --> 07:16:05,260
Made sure I read the second.

7005
07:16:09,860 --> 07:16:10,760
Maybe I should...

7006
07:16:10,780 --> 07:16:12,800
I should have got a good cast first.

7007
07:16:17,360 --> 07:16:17,940
Okay.

7008
07:16:20,400 --> 07:16:21,280
Okay, nice.

7009
07:16:22,600 --> 07:16:23,720
A moon drop.

7010
07:16:24,160 --> 07:16:25,640
Alright, another moon drop.

7011
07:16:27,740 --> 07:16:28,680
Oh, I missed the silver?

7012
07:16:29,520 --> 07:16:30,360
I was like confused.

7013
07:16:30,800 --> 07:16:32,060
I don't think I need more silver.

7014
07:16:33,400 --> 07:16:36,080
But leave the surface to the gods and me.

7015
07:16:36,800 --> 07:16:40,280
Do not become distracted by the sealed crossroads gateway
leading up.

7016
07:16:40,840 --> 07:16:42,160
Don't go up!

7017
07:16:42,820 --> 07:16:44,120
Yeah, tell me what to do.

7018
07:16:44,280 --> 07:16:44,920
Oh, shit, wait.

7019
07:16:46,760 --> 07:16:49,920
Replenish, restore hex, restores 15 up to three times.

7020
07:16:50,620 --> 07:16:54,460
Return turns you impervious, living while her own abilities
were...

7021
07:16:54,460 --> 07:16:56,420
Your hex makes everything else move slower.

7022
07:16:57,020 --> 07:16:58,800
Wait, this is all so good.

7023
07:17:00,460 --> 07:17:02,160
Wait, these are actually really good.

7024
07:17:04,020 --> 07:17:05,220
Why don't you want to go up?

7025
07:17:05,340 --> 07:17:06,940
I'm going to go up anyway.

7026
07:17:07,280 --> 07:17:09,000
As soon as I beat up Kronos.

7027
07:17:10,480 --> 07:17:12,420

I couldn't leave.

7036
07:18:25,830 --> 07:18:27,090
I couldn't leave.

7037
07:18:27,510 --> 07:18:29,070
I don't know what happened.

7038
07:18:37,360 --> 07:18:38,420
Oh my, I couldn't leave.

7039
07:18:38,580 --> 07:18:39,080

Okay.

7044
07:18:48,980 --> 07:18:50,080
I was stuck.

7045
07:18:53,970 --> 07:18:55,300
I couldn't leave.

7046
07:18:55,300 --> 07:19:00,160
I wanted to leave, but she held me down.

7047
07:19:00,480 --> 07:19:02,140
Oh my, this is actually the worst threat.

7048
07:19:02,460 --> 07:19:03,280
Okay, I have to heal.

7049
07:19:07,700 --> 07:19:10,120
No, no, I need a heal.

7050
07:19:10,660 --> 07:19:11,960
Oh my god.

7051
07:19:15,840 --> 07:19:16,840
Nemesis, what are you doing?

7052
07:19:16,860 --> 07:19:18,080
Why are you here?

7053
07:19:21,280 --> 07:19:22,280
They'll manage.

7054
07:19:22,740 --> 07:19:23,380
I'm on break.

7055
07:19:23,680 --> 07:19:24,900
Why are you back?

7056
07:19:25,320 --> 07:19:26,060
You'll regret it.

7057
07:19:28,100 --> 07:19:31,160
you're unsafe, seeing as I cleared the path for you.

7058
07:19:32,980 --> 07:19:34,240
I don't need your aid in this.

7059
07:19:34,780 --> 07:19:36,960
Other than the responsibilities you've already been
assigned.

7060
07:19:37,260 --> 07:19:38,000
Oh my god.

7061
07:19:38,280 --> 07:19:39,160
Come on, girl.

7062
07:19:39,620 --> 07:19:39,960

Please!

7064
07:19:40,760 --> 07:19:42,880
I don't want to do this contest.

7065
07:19:43,940 --> 07:19:45,340
Here's something for your trouble.

7066
07:19:45,720 --> 07:19:47,120
Then I suggest you move along.

7067
07:19:49,320 --> 07:19:50,400
Oh, thank God.

07:19:50,800 --> 07:19:52,280
Oh, oh, thank God.

07:20:16,110 --> 07:20:16,110
It's fine.

7080
07:20:16,670 --> 07:20:19,070
I don't know why this fucks with me so much.

Okay, there you go.

Of course.

07:24:39,570 --> 07:24:40,070
Yeah.

7140
07:24:45,630 --> 07:24:47,550
Lately I dreamt a father once again.

7141
07:24:47,850 --> 07:24:50,250
When Kronos came for him and you took me to safety.

7142
07:24:50,910 --> 07:24:53,130
Except this time, I saw more than before.

7143
07:24:54,370 --> 07:24:56,710
T'was no mere dream, of course.

7144
07:24:56,790 --> 07:24:59,890
What more did you learn whilst you lingered thus?

7145
07:25:00,190 --> 07:25:02,130
Oh, I can- I'm like a witch too.

7146
07:25:02,270 --> 07:25:05,610
Kronos demanded father tell him how to learn- I'm like a
prophecy.

7147
07:25:05,890 --> 07:25:07,130
I can see prophecies.

7148
07:25:07,310 --> 07:25:07,930
Where are they called?

7149
07:25:09,470 --> 07:25:10,310
It's here?

7150
07:25:11,050 --> 07:25:12,910
And must have found them finally.

7151
07:25:15,410 --> 07:25:21,530
I don't know, I've lost count.

7152
07:25:22,690 --> 07:25:24,230
Oracle, yeah, an Oracle.

7153
07:25:25,010 --> 07:25:25,290
Suppose us.

7154
07:25:25,970 --> 07:25:29,230
As though we've nobody to count on, save- ourselves

7155
07:25:37,980 --> 07:25:48,960
oh my god oh my god wait what the fuck is this new move okay
that move is new because I'm like what the fuck I've never

7156
07:25:48,960 --> 07:25:56,200
seen that one before I'm so confused I was so confused
because I never saw that move before

7157
07:26:01,350 --> 07:26:05,790
okay it's so weird We're not having the 200 thing.

7158
07:26:09,930 --> 07:26:11,090
I'm not used to it.

7159
07:26:12,430 --> 07:26:15,650
I'm not used to not doing 200 damage right off the bat.

7160
07:26:16,190 --> 07:26:17,190
It's just so weird.

7161
07:26:17,750 --> 07:26:18,170
Oh, no.

7162
07:26:18,430 --> 07:26:18,810
Okay, it's fine.

7163
07:26:19,930 --> 07:26:20,770
I don't need armor.

7164
07:26:30,380 --> 07:26:31,180
Let's go ahead.

7165
07:26:31,400 --> 07:26:31,820
We're fine.

7166
07:26:32,320 --> 07:26:33,580
We got the system in.

7167
07:26:34,640 --> 07:26:34,800
Please.

7168
07:26:35,720 --> 07:26:36,200
Oh, shit!

7169
07:26:36,540 --> 07:26:38,960
Wow, I almost ran back into it.

7170
07:26:40,080 --> 07:26:41,380
I couldn't help.

7171
07:26:43,720 --> 07:26:44,180
Okay, it's fine.

7172
07:26:46,180 --> 07:26:47,860
I was like, oh, it didn't hit me.

7173
07:26:48,340 --> 07:26:51,160
I mean, you guys should run back and let it hit me.

7174
07:26:54,760 --> 07:26:56,920
I was just not used to it not hitting me.

7175
07:26:57,200 --> 07:26:57,420
You know?

7176
07:27:00,520 --> 07:27:01,000
Okay.

7180
07:27:12,300 --> 07:27:13,580
We don't need the armor.

7181
07:27:14,260 --> 07:27:15,340

Let's see.

7196
07:28:17,780 --> 07:28:19,400

Like, it's just a crab.

7211
07:29:19,420 --> 07:29:20,360

07:29:23,260 --> 07:29:23,760
Okay, never mind.

We don't need the shadow, whatever it is.

7215
07:29:34,950 --> 07:29:35,990
Jesus Christ.

7216
07:29:38,770 --> 07:29:41,130

I can use this.

7224
07:29:54,150 --> 07:29:55,510
I wonder, too.

7225
07:29:55,810 --> 07:29:57,210
Maybe I can forge something.

7226
07:29:58,810 --> 07:29:59,150
Oh, yeah.

7227
07:30:00,030 --> 07:30:02,230

What doubled?

7246
07:30:40,980 --> 07:30:41,540
Oh.

7247
07:30:43,500 --> 07:30:45,020
What did it give me?

7248
07:30:46,100 --> 07:30:47,620
Oh, it gave me Snow Queen.

7249
07:30:49,220 --> 07:30:50,160

I'm so scared.

7254
07:31:21,480 --> 07:31:22,960
I'm so scared.

7255
07:31:25,080 --> 07:31:25,960
He's back.

7256
07:31:27,100 --> 07:31:28,780
I don't know what to do.

7257
07:31:29,400 --> 07:31:30,540
He's so scary.

7258
07:31:31,620 --> 07:31:34,260
I've never been so scared before.

7259
07:31:35,360 --> 07:31:36,280

07:31:40,760 --> 07:31:42,880
The displeasure of fighting.

hello no no Oh yeah, that's my brother.

7274
07:32:40,850 --> 07:32:42,370
He was an interesting subject.

7275
07:32:43,170 --> 07:32:46,170
The interval since last we met grows ever longer now.

7276
07:32:46,610 --> 07:32:47,070
Chaos time.

7277
07:32:47,230 --> 07:32:48,110
Do you know his status?

7278
07:32:48,770 --> 07:32:50,170
Is that a gift of chaos yet?

7279
07:32:51,270 --> 07:32:52,810
You mean my brother's Agrius?

7280
07:32:53,670 --> 07:32:57,250
Kronos took him, along with my parents and their closest
associates.

7281
07:32:58,010 --> 07:33:00,890
They're in the lowest reaches of the underworld, where I'm
headed now.

7282
07:33:02,510 --> 07:33:03,030
I see.

7283
07:33:03,550 --> 07:33:06,550
Time appears to be the source of many problems recently.

7284
07:33:07,130 --> 07:33:09,370
As for your brother, I found him to be quite a bit.

7285
07:33:09,390 --> 07:33:21,170
using how interesting the offspring can be so dissimilar and
i mean i feel like they're both quite similar uh plus 29

7286
07:33:21,170 --> 07:33:33,650
what first time jesus christ okay you take 500 damage okay
each time you you take five damage afterwards oh yeah no one

7287
07:33:33,650 --> 07:33:40,690

good.

7288
07:33:41,770 --> 07:33:42,110

7289
07:33:42,150 --> 07:33:43,670
How much nectar do I have?

7290
07:33:44,770 --> 07:33:45,670
Alright, that's enough.

7291
07:33:47,310 --> 07:33:49,090
One sounds good.

7292
07:33:50,250 --> 07:33:51,830
Okay, I just have to do this.

7293
07:33:52,350 --> 07:33:53,010
That's fine.

7294
07:33:53,230 --> 07:33:54,910
I feel like I'm used to doing that.

7295
07:33:55,550 --> 07:33:55,930
Anyway.

7296
07:33:58,830 --> 07:33:59,870
Jesus, fucking...

7297
07:33:59,870 --> 07:34:01,130
There you go.

7298
07:34:01,790 --> 07:34:02,590
Y'all get rid.

7299
07:34:05,270 --> 07:34:06,010
There you go.

7300
07:34:07,170 --> 07:34:07,950
That's fine.

7301
07:34:09,530 --> 07:34:10,930
Oh, I don't have any more.

7302
07:34:11,110 --> 07:34:11,490
It's okay.

7303
07:34:11,590 --> 07:34:12,710
I don't need magic.

7304
07:34:13,430 --> 07:34:14,430
I don't need it.

7305
07:34:18,090 --> 07:34:18,830
Uh, oh.

7306
07:34:19,770 --> 07:34:20,570
Grab this.

7307
07:34:20,770 --> 07:34:21,670
Look upon me.

7308
07:34:24,670 --> 07:34:25,070
What?

7309
07:34:26,390 --> 07:34:26,790
What?

7310
07:34:27,090 --> 07:34:28,010
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

7311
07:34:28,150 --> 07:34:29,970
I was so confused.

7312
07:34:35,660 --> 07:34:36,560
Okay, it's fine.

7313
07:34:36,700 --> 07:34:36,880
It's fine.

7314
07:34:36,940 --> 07:34:37,460
I don't need it.

7315
07:34:37,680 --> 07:34:38,560
Guys, I don't need it.

7316
07:34:38,740 --> 07:34:39,260
I don't need it.

7317
07:34:39,400 --> 07:34:40,520
I know I don't need it.

7318
07:34:40,780 --> 07:34:41,180
I...

7319
07:34:43,300 --> 07:34:44,100
It's fine.

7320
07:34:44,700 --> 07:34:45,200
It's fine.

7321
07:34:45,440 --> 07:34:46,640
I never needed it.

7322
07:34:48,680 --> 07:34:49,580
It's okay.

7323
07:34:49,720 --> 07:34:51,000
I don't need it.

7324
07:34:57,370 --> 07:34:58,370
I don't know.

7325
07:34:58,510 --> 07:35:02,170
I don't know why I struggled it from this, okay?

7326
07:35:02,450 --> 07:35:03,370
I don't know.

7327
07:35:04,030 --> 07:35:08,530
There's just something about it.

7328
07:35:08,970 --> 07:35:10,330
I think it's the reading.

7329
07:35:13,290 --> 07:35:13,890
It's...

7330
07:35:15,010 --> 07:35:16,830
Look, it's stop reading, okay?

7331
07:35:17,350 --> 07:35:18,850
It's my one weakness!

7332
07:35:25,580 --> 07:35:26,980
Alright, here you go.

7333
07:35:27,260 --> 07:35:28,440
You dash more frequently.

7334
07:35:28,800 --> 07:35:30,820
Any gain is worth more.

7335
07:35:31,480 --> 07:35:33,220
Oh, okay, we'll grab Nimbo.

7336
07:35:33,380 --> 07:35:34,920
I feel like Nimbo is better.

7337
07:35:40,240 --> 07:35:42,340
I feel like that's always better.

7338
07:35:43,000 --> 07:35:43,980
Alright, tell me.

7339
07:35:49,410 --> 07:35:50,930

Oh my gosh, she's like Taylor Swift.

7347
07:36:55,100 --> 07:37:01,040
It's like how people don't like Taylor Swift now because her
songs, because she's too happy in her relationships.

7348
07:37:02,400 --> 07:37:03,360
It's like fucked up.

7349
07:37:03,600 --> 07:37:09,980
It's fucked up that she was a better songwriter when she
was, uh, she had, she was more depressed.

Oh, Mickey claims how obsessed will you?

Apparently, don't have enough mana for it.

Except for this.

07:41:16,780 --> 07:41:17,860
Not a chance.

7404
07:41:18,120 --> 07:41:19,280
Okay, it's okay.

7405
07:41:21,540 --> 07:41:22,040
One more.

7406
07:41:22,400 --> 07:41:23,320
Last one.

7407
07:41:24,900 --> 07:41:25,500
Hammer time.

7408
07:41:27,940 --> 07:41:28,900
Wait, oh my god.

7409
07:41:29,040 --> 07:41:30,020
They could have given me an echo.

7410
07:41:32,440 --> 07:41:34,260
I forgot to do the hammer last.

7411
07:41:34,600 --> 07:41:36,460
So let me see if I can find the other one.

7412
07:41:39,200 --> 07:41:41,020
In case I bump into the echo again.

7413
07:41:42,840 --> 07:41:43,720
Where is it?

7414
07:41:44,060 --> 07:41:44,480
It's like here.

07:41:44,540 --> 07:41:45,080
Okay, there we go.

I really missed the projectiles.

7422
07:41:59,100 --> 07:42:00,860
The projectiles were so strong.

7423
07:42:02,520 --> 07:42:03,680
Projectile freezes.

7424
07:42:07,540 --> 07:42:10,120

I don't believe in myself, guys.

7439
07:43:00,180 --> 07:43:02,120

7440

Okay.

7441
07:43:09,970 --> 07:43:12,730

07:43:31,650 --> 07:43:33,070
Yeah, then I can use moon water.

7447
07:43:33,330 --> 07:43:35,450
Yeah, I'm thinking about that.

7448
07:43:38,030 --> 07:43:38,250
Oh!

7449
07:43:39,890 --> 07:43:40,770
I'm alive.

7450
07:43:41,370 --> 07:43:42,030
It's okay, I'm okay.

7451
07:43:42,450 --> 07:43:42,970
I'm okay.

7452
07:43:42,970 --> 07:43:43,470
I'm okay, guys.

7453
07:43:43,630 --> 07:43:44,230
Don't worry.

7454
07:43:45,990 --> 07:43:47,330
Everything is fine.

7455
07:43:48,950 --> 07:43:49,470
Okay.

7456
07:43:50,910 --> 07:43:51,790
Okay, nice.

7457
07:43:51,930 --> 07:43:53,850
I should be able to afford moon water here.

7458
07:43:55,950 --> 07:43:57,050
There you go.

7459
07:43:58,510 --> 07:43:58,570
Yeah.

7460
07:44:00,170 --> 07:44:01,550
Alright, now I should be fine.

7461
07:44:02,010 --> 07:44:06,390
Your cast inflicts freeze and repeal deals damage in the
binding circle.

7462
07:44:06,590 --> 07:44:07,390
You're like, oh.

7463
07:44:09,050 --> 07:44:10,930
Okay, but I could have more shield.

7464
07:44:13,130 --> 07:44:13,530
Oh, wait.

7465
07:44:13,550 --> 07:44:15,650
All of these are really good, so it's hard.

7466
07:44:15,830 --> 07:44:17,630
They're all really good, guys.

7467
07:44:21,840 --> 07:44:22,280
Okay.

7468
07:44:22,300 --> 07:44:23,340
Ah!

7469
07:44:27,890 --> 07:44:29,830
You prime 30, that's true.

7470
07:44:31,670 --> 07:44:34,950
I don't have mana- I do have mana recovery with my right
click.

7471
07:44:36,710 --> 07:44:37,590
Chill this ass?

7472
07:44:37,730 --> 07:44:39,210
Okay, we'll do the cast then.

7473
07:44:44,420 --> 07:44:44,900
Freeze!

7474
07:44:48,380 --> 07:44:49,820
Shit, there's the moon.

7475
07:44:50,540 --> 07:44:52,140
Oh, the moon is not even locked.

7476
07:44:52,320 --> 07:44:52,540
Nice.

7477
07:44:54,520 --> 07:44:55,720
What do I want?

7478
07:44:57,460 --> 07:44:59,980
Hex restores, whenever you use your hex, you gain...

7479
07:44:59,980 --> 07:45:01,720
Oh, wait, that's... I like money.

7480
07:45:03,580 --> 07:45:04,180
Okay, wait.

7481
07:45:04,300 --> 07:45:05,100
Oh, this is hard.

7482
07:45:07,760 --> 07:45:08,520
What do you want?

7483
07:45:08,700 --> 07:45:10,400
Fortune or...

7484
07:45:10,400 --> 07:45:10,760
Restore?

7485
07:45:12,280 --> 07:45:15,500
I feel like I rarely use my hex, too.

7486
07:45:18,640 --> 07:45:19,900
15 money is nothing.

7487
07:45:20,000 --> 07:45:20,500
You're right.

7488
07:45:21,160 --> 07:45:22,240
I'll grab that then.

7489
07:45:22,680 --> 07:45:23,860
You guys are fucking right.

7490
07:45:24,460 --> 07:45:25,500

No, fuck you, bro.

7522
07:48:15,800 --> 07:48:17,280
I can't be bothered.

7523
07:48:17,840 --> 07:48:19,780
Now, that's right.

07:48:20,200 --> 07:48:22,580

Freeze forever!

There we go.

7529
07:48:40,100 --> 07:48:41,020
Wow, that was so strong.

7530
07:48:41,280 --> 07:48:42,420
Crude sorcery at best.

7531
07:48:43,420 --> 07:48:45,540
Okay, maybe I can get the fireball here.

7532
07:48:46,200 --> 07:48:47,260

I'm gonna get three so I can cast it.

7537
07:48:54,280 --> 07:48:56,460
Because it does fire and freeze, right?

7538
07:48:59,640 --> 07:49:01,120
Okay, I'm gonna do this.

More HP is always good.

7582
07:51:10,770 --> 07:51:12,390
I am not going to take the shield yet.

7583
07:51:13,130 --> 07:51:13,810
I'm going to wait.

7584
07:51:15,730 --> 07:51:17,170
Oh, my God, you fucker.

7585
07:51:18,490 --> 07:51:18,990

We're okay.

07:51:29,190 --> 07:51:30,990
I just, I do not like the suck.

7591
07:51:35,340 --> 07:51:37,500
I am not okay with this.

7592
07:51:43,890 --> 07:51:44,250
Okay.

7593
07:51:46,210 --> 07:51:47,110
That's fine.

7594
07:51:47,970 --> 07:51:51,370
We got the fire going in.

7595
07:51:54,010 --> 07:51:55,150
Okay, not this last guy.

7596
07:51:57,990 --> 07:52:00,110
All right, and then we'll grab the shield last.

7597
07:52:02,670 --> 07:52:05,510
Uh, purity, your hex restores five.

7598
07:52:05,910 --> 07:52:08,430
Use plus one hex before using a fountain.

7599
07:52:09,070 --> 07:52:10,470
Hex restores plus 50.

7600
07:52:11,130 --> 07:52:11,430
Wait.

7601
07:52:13,270 --> 07:52:14,010
What's this?

7602
07:52:14,990 --> 07:52:15,390
You deal.

7603
07:52:15,530 --> 07:52:16,030
Oh, shit.

7604
07:52:16,090 --> 07:52:16,950
Wait, that's good.

7605
07:52:17,870 --> 07:52:18,970
Plus 50 damage?

7606
07:52:19,090 --> 07:52:19,750
Fuck yeah.

7607
07:52:21,050 --> 07:52:22,770
And then we'll grab this too.

7608
07:52:24,090 --> 07:52:24,810
Plus 20.

7609
07:52:25,070 --> 07:52:26,090
Boon or money?

7610
07:52:26,730 --> 07:52:28,790
Okay, money might have more boons.

7611
07:52:29,770 --> 07:52:32,210
I might be able to power up a boon with money.

7612
07:52:33,950 --> 07:52:34,510
Yeah, see?

7613
07:52:35,270 --> 07:52:36,250
I knew it.

7614
07:52:36,570 --> 07:52:37,670
In the name of Hades.

7615
07:52:40,030 --> 07:52:42,590
Your special inflicts blitz as well.

7616
07:52:42,970 --> 07:52:43,890
Your foe is struck.

7617
07:52:44,070 --> 07:52:46,610
Damage from moves activated makes them stronger.

7618
07:52:47,570 --> 07:52:47,890
Oh.

7619
07:52:50,690 --> 07:52:51,890
Oh, I don't know.

7620
07:52:52,090 --> 07:52:53,730
I feel like maybe one?

7621
07:52:54,570 --> 07:52:55,390
More blitz?

7622
07:52:56,110 --> 07:52:57,610
Yeah, more Blitz, right?

7623
07:53:01,550 --> 07:53:01,950
Three?

7624
07:53:03,250 --> 07:53:05,490
That requires me to use Cast more.

7625
07:53:13,970 --> 07:53:14,230
Really?

7626
07:53:14,530 --> 07:53:14,850
Three?

7627
07:53:16,230 --> 07:53:17,910
Do I use it enough, guys?

7628
07:53:34,850 --> 07:53:35,510
Hmm...

7629
07:53:36,670 --> 07:53:37,330
Oh...

7630
07:53:38,010 --> 07:53:39,270
I don't know.

7631
07:53:45,390 --> 07:53:46,690
I'm gonna go with one.

7632
07:53:47,410 --> 07:53:49,070
I feel like I spam it more.

7633
07:53:52,110 --> 07:53:59,830
God, it's, God, I'm back, oh, okay, I'm ready, okay, before
I fight him, okay, I'm, that you know, I'm ready, oh, I'm

7635
07:54:11,450 --> 07:54:21,970
something about it, like, I feel like, I told you, he just
pisses me off.

7636
07:54:22,530 --> 07:54:27,010
I'm fucking, every time, every fucking time.

7637
07:54:27,490 --> 07:54:32,350
Are you fucking kidding me?

7638
07:54:33,250 --> 07:54:35,230
I had 50 shields.

7639
07:54:35,430 --> 07:54:36,910
What the fuck do you mean?

7640
07:54:41,150 --> 07:54:41,810
Okay.

7641
07:54:42,690 --> 07:54:43,890
That's fine.

7642
07:54:47,680 --> 07:54:49,640
All right, fucking, okay, I resisted it.

7643
07:54:49,760 --> 07:54:50,420
That's right.

7644
07:54:55,420 --> 07:54:56,600
That's fucking right.

7645
07:54:56,760 --> 07:54:58,020
I'm like, get resisted.

7646
07:54:59,760 --> 07:55:02,340
Oh, my God, you fucking.

7647
07:55:03,260 --> 07:55:05,860
A fucking course you sent that one.

7648
07:55:06,780 --> 07:55:09,320
Oh, my God, a fucking course.

7649
07:55:09,860 --> 07:55:10,940
Oh, there you go.

7650
07:55:11,100 --> 07:55:11,880
There we go.

7651
07:55:12,480 --> 07:55:12,900
It's God.

7652
07:55:16,480 --> 07:55:17,680
Okay, it's five.

7653
07:55:21,790 --> 07:55:22,130
Okay.

7654
07:55:22,150 --> 07:55:22,570
It's okay.

7655
07:55:24,910 --> 07:55:25,730
It's okay.

7656
07:55:29,280 --> 07:55:30,820
Okay, I knew he was gonna be here.

7657
07:55:35,480 --> 07:55:37,160
Oh my god, I'm only halfway.

7658
07:55:37,340 --> 07:55:38,780
I missed the hef.

7659
07:55:38,920 --> 07:55:41,020
I have not encountered hef at all.

7660
07:55:41,460 --> 07:55:42,560
That's the crazy part.

7661
07:55:42,620 --> 07:55:44,060
I missed the 200 damage.

7662
07:55:44,160 --> 07:55:46,220
The 500 damage shit was so strong.

7663
07:55:46,560 --> 07:55:48,260
That's actually so broken.

7664
07:55:48,420 --> 07:55:49,140
I need that.

7665
07:55:49,580 --> 07:55:51,400
That's why I think that's why I don't like my build.

7666
07:55:51,520 --> 07:55:53,980
I feel like everything is taking so long now.

7667
07:55:58,750 --> 07:56:02,770
Oh My god, fuck you

7668
07:56:09,140 --> 07:56:21,690
Okay It's five Oh my god, it's totally oh My god, it's it's
five

7669
07:56:26,550 --> 07:56:33,690
I don't have Guys, I no longer feel fine.

7670
07:56:36,930 --> 07:56:45,050
I'm just saying if I had the fucking plus plus 500 shit,
this would have been so different.

7671
07:56:47,470 --> 07:56:48,190
There we go.

7672
07:56:49,630 --> 07:56:50,370
There we go.

7673
07:56:51,130 --> 07:56:57,070
Three red and many fenged maws turn now appreciatively
toward the princess of the dead.

7674
07:56:57,170 --> 07:56:57,790
We did it.

7675
07:56:57,970 --> 07:56:58,870
We fucking did it.

7676
07:57:01,010 --> 07:57:03,250
Peace has been soothed yet again.

7677
07:57:05,730 --> 07:57:08,270
Please, Arras, please, please, please, please, Arras,
please.

7678
07:57:08,570 --> 07:57:09,150
Please.

7679
07:57:10,950 --> 07:57:12,590
Are you not entertained?

7680
07:57:13,130 --> 07:57:16,270
Are you not done messing with me?

7681
07:57:17,170 --> 07:57:19,190
Please, please leave.

7682
07:57:19,970 --> 07:57:21,550
No one likes you.

7683
07:57:22,950 --> 07:57:24,670
Out of the fields at least.

7684
07:57:24,910 --> 07:57:26,730
Okay, at least I can swap to the tooth now.

7685
07:57:29,750 --> 07:57:31,210
Okay, and water.

7686
07:57:32,470 --> 07:57:33,990
All right, before we go, okay.

7687
07:57:35,550 --> 07:57:36,270
One last drop.

7688
07:57:36,330 --> 07:57:39,110
I know I'm peeing a lot, but I've been hydrating a lot, too.

7689
07:57:39,870 --> 07:57:41,090
Not much farther now.

7690
07:57:43,310 --> 07:57:44,370
Oh, my God.

7691
07:57:44,610 --> 07:57:45,570
She's here, isn't she?

7692
07:57:45,910 --> 07:57:47,430
Oh, but there's hope.

7693
07:57:47,710 --> 07:57:48,230
Okay, I need to pee.

7694
07:57:48,330 --> 07:57:50,310
I'm a victory pee right now.

7695
07:59:00,430 --> 07:59:05,590
Like, she's got, she's actually got, oh my God.

7696
07:59:06,690 --> 07:59:14,950

don't care what happens she's not here oh my god really just

7699
07:59:32,450 --> 07:59:34,910
sent 20 snipers like

7700
07:59:37,930 --> 07:59:39,530
Okay, it's okay.

7701
07:59:40,450 --> 07:59:41,270
That's crazy.

7702
07:59:41,430 --> 07:59:44,170
They actually sent 20 snipers here just to kill me.

7703
07:59:46,210 --> 07:59:47,210
There you go.

7704
07:59:48,550 --> 07:59:51,090
Like, I'm that much of a threat.

7705
07:59:53,170 --> 07:59:54,670
Oh my god.

7706
07:59:55,170 --> 07:59:57,290
Oh my god.

7707
07:59:57,470 --> 07:59:59,950
Like, what am I looking at?

7708
08:00:00,350 --> 08:00:03,230
Like, Jesus.

7709
08:00:09,250 --> 08:00:10,270
That's crazy.

7710
08:00:13,270 --> 08:00:13,790
Okay.

7711
08:00:16,310 --> 08:00:17,610
Oh, here we go.

7712
08:00:18,630 --> 08:00:21,210
I was not expecting 20 fucking snipers.

7713
08:00:25,980 --> 08:00:26,680
Okay, it's fine.

7714
08:00:27,800 --> 08:00:28,320
There we go.

7715
08:00:31,760 --> 08:00:32,940
I'm gonna have Blitz on it.

7716
08:00:34,320 --> 08:00:36,480
I have not fucked- Oh my god, it's the rats.

7717
08:00:42,930 --> 08:00:43,410
Okay.

7718
08:00:45,810 --> 08:00:46,290
Okay.

7719
08:00:46,810 --> 08:00:49,130
It takes me so long to kill them, too.

7720
08:00:49,670 --> 08:00:50,690
I think that's the worst part.

7721
08:00:50,830 --> 08:00:59,170
Like, I felt so spoiled by the 500 damage shit with my right
click that it feels so slow now to kill things.

7722
08:01:00,170 --> 08:01:00,590
I feel like...

7723
08:01:00,590 --> 08:01:03,690
I definitely think I killed things a lot faster with that
Hef upgrade.

7724
08:01:04,410 --> 08:01:05,170
Oh, my God.

7725
08:01:05,230 --> 08:01:06,170
I don't know if I won't.

7726
08:01:06,330 --> 08:01:07,310
I don't know.

7727
08:01:09,750 --> 08:01:12,670
I don't know if there's anything that Hestia is going to
give me that.

7728
08:01:12,690 --> 08:01:13,470
I would want.

7729
08:01:16,570 --> 08:01:19,130
Does Hestia give me anything that I actually want, though?

7730
08:01:19,750 --> 08:01:20,510
I don't know.

7731
08:01:21,470 --> 08:01:24,690
Is there any... I feel like Hestia doesn't have upgrades
that...

7732
08:01:26,390 --> 08:01:26,790
Hmm.

7733
08:01:28,430 --> 08:01:29,510
There is?

7734
08:01:29,630 --> 08:01:30,050
Okay.

7735
08:01:30,250 --> 08:01:32,490
If I just really got it, but...

7736
08:01:32,490 --> 08:01:34,970
Oh my god, who the fuck is that?

7737
08:01:36,990 --> 08:01:38,270
Wait a minute.

7738
08:01:40,250 --> 08:01:42,090
Oh my god.

7739
08:01:47,980 --> 08:01:50,160
Oh my god.

7740
08:01:50,740 --> 08:01:52,840
Oh my god.

7741
08:01:53,120 --> 08:01:54,540
I do not like that.

7742
08:01:54,600 --> 08:01:56,180
It's taking me so long.

7743
08:01:59,320 --> 08:02:00,000
Okay.

7744
08:02:01,380 --> 08:02:02,080
Okay, he's stunned.

7745
08:02:02,440 --> 08:02:03,060
He's stunned.

7746
08:02:04,720 --> 08:02:06,220
Ladies and gentlemen, he's stunned.

7747
08:02:07,600 --> 08:02:08,220
Ah, resistant.

7748
08:02:11,160 --> 08:02:12,440
Okay, there you go.

7749
08:02:13,820 --> 08:02:15,240
Oh, thank god.

7750
08:02:16,900 --> 08:02:22,660
okay your special also launches but uses turn you deal more
damage to foes there are nowhere near other foes your foes

7751
08:02:22,660 --> 08:02:27,920
perishes in a blast two two for the boss oh two or three
guys

7752
08:02:33,020 --> 08:02:46,000
i guess three three for i guess oh i don't know two for boss
right okay two for boss

7753
08:02:49,600 --> 08:02:52,260
Mining, mining, mining.

7754
08:02:56,920 --> 08:02:58,360
Dad, come over here!

7755
08:02:58,540 --> 08:02:59,100
It's you.

7756
08:02:59,340 --> 08:03:03,840
When Kronos took our family and the house, and you bade the
witch of the crossroads take me.

7757
08:03:04,580 --> 08:03:07,260
I remember it somehow, or dreamt of it.

7758
08:03:07,460 --> 08:03:08,420
Yeah, I had a dream.

7759
08:03:09,360 --> 08:03:10,940
Demand you tell him of the fates.

7760
08:03:14,160 --> 08:03:16,060
How could you possibly learn?

7761
08:03:16,240 --> 08:03:17,360
Yeah, I had an oracle.

7762
08:03:18,540 --> 08:03:22,740
Out of prophecy, well, not prophecy, like a vision of the
past.

7763
08:03:25,440 --> 08:03:28,840
Oh, wait.

7764
08:03:29,180 --> 08:03:30,540
Oh, so Kronos doesn't have them yet.

7765
08:03:30,820 --> 08:03:32,880
Wait, you never told Kronos how to find the fates.

7766
08:03:34,180 --> 08:03:35,200
Wait, did he have?

7767
08:03:35,260 --> 08:03:36,060
Does he have them?

7768
08:03:36,340 --> 08:03:37,420
He's captured them.

7769
08:03:38,260 --> 08:03:39,280
Not long ago, perhaps.

7770
08:03:39,500 --> 08:03:41,860
But nonetheless, I'm certain of it.

7771
08:03:42,100 --> 08:03:43,360
Does he actually, though?

7772
08:03:43,480 --> 08:03:43,840
What?

7773
08:03:44,120 --> 08:03:44,460
No.

7774
08:03:45,320 --> 08:03:50,360
But if this is true, now that my father's plan for Kronos,
Conquest is much closer to fruition.

7775
08:03:50,420 --> 08:03:51,280
Oh, he does have them.

7776
08:03:51,360 --> 08:03:52,500
Who the fuck snitched?

7777
08:03:53,540 --> 08:03:55,940
Daughter, what chance do you have?

7778
08:03:56,120 --> 08:03:57,300
Yeah, but I'm built different.

7779
08:03:57,820 --> 08:03:59,380
I'm not like any other gods.

7780
08:04:12,430 --> 08:04:14,190
Okay, I feel like it's two.

7781
08:04:14,330 --> 08:04:15,450
This is dog shit.

7782
08:04:15,550 --> 08:04:16,650
I don't have the other ones.

7783
08:04:17,910 --> 08:04:18,350
Uh...

7784
08:04:19,670 --> 08:04:21,590
Yeah, I think I should get the two.

7785
08:04:22,770 --> 08:04:23,210
Yeah.

7786
08:04:24,630 --> 08:04:26,470
No, I lost one, didn't I?

7787
08:04:27,530 --> 08:04:28,490
Don't I still...

shortage of this on the surface okay will he let me pet him

even realize I thought I have one left that means I've been
gaming I think I've been like always like at the brink of

7793
08:05:11,580 --> 08:05:19,340

thought I almost got me.

7795
08:05:39,320 --> 08:05:39,720
It's okay.

7796
08:05:40,840 --> 08:05:42,260

Wherever the money is.

7846
08:08:54,410 --> 08:08:55,290

Get frozen.

7855
08:09:11,670 --> 08:09:12,130
Get frozen.

7856
08:09:12,390 --> 08:09:12,770
Get frozen.

7857
08:09:14,110 --> 08:09:14,830

Oh, I got nothing big boys.

08:09:22,590 --> 08:09:23,670
These guys are hell, though.

7861
08:09:24,310 --> 08:09:26,190
These guys, I gotta be so careful.

7862
08:09:26,270 --> 08:09:27,810
They do so much damage.

7863
08:09:30,450 --> 08:09:31,770
They actually can do so much.

7864
08:09:34,970 --> 08:09:35,330
Okay.

7865
08:09:35,710 --> 08:09:36,950
That should be the last one.

7866
08:09:37,330 --> 08:09:37,710
Yay!

7867
08:09:39,990 --> 08:09:52,110
Oh, them but oh my god i'm fucking rich thousand dollar

7869
08:10:05,760 --> 08:10:09,560

good

7870
08:10:14,160 --> 08:10:16,220
I do so little damage.

7871
08:10:16,360 --> 08:10:17,100
I hate it.

7872
08:10:20,240 --> 08:10:22,580
I just do too little damage.

7873
08:10:24,560 --> 08:10:27,560
I wish my damage was just a little higher.

7874
08:10:32,570 --> 08:10:33,670
That's the worst part.

7875
08:10:33,850 --> 08:10:36,070
This is going to take forever for against Kronos.

7876
08:10:41,470 --> 08:10:44,270
It's just going to take, like, way too long, I feel like.

7877
08:10:44,950 --> 08:10:45,970
You shouldn't have crossed me.

7878
08:10:46,050 --> 08:10:48,230
Unless, like, I get, like, the most insane.

7879
08:10:48,250 --> 08:10:56,490
upgrades where are you i don't think i need to kill the
laser tower it's just a waste of time

7880
08:10:59,950 --> 08:11:09,950
uh your cast inflicts freeze and repeatedly deals damage to
foes in the blinding circle when we attack a special does

7881
08:11:09,950 --> 08:11:19,770
damage you how will they cast oh i had a one or three i feel
like three three because the fight the thing is so strong

7882
08:11:19,770 --> 08:11:31,930
anyway i'm gonna do a three one scales better what skills
against chronos which would be better against chronos one or

7883
08:11:31,930 --> 08:11:45,100
three okay because i'll be chucking that i'll be chucking
that shit on him one all right

7884
08:11:48,960 --> 08:11:52,760
Because that thing is going to be on him 24-7.

7885
08:11:55,980 --> 08:11:58,280
I mean, I could technically...

7886
08:12:00,420 --> 08:12:02,680
I mean, I could technically buy everything.

7887
08:12:09,420 --> 08:12:10,600
I have to go with one.

7888
08:12:11,400 --> 08:12:13,240
At that point, I'm going with one.

7889
08:12:14,300 --> 08:12:15,160
For the damage.

7890
08:12:15,340 --> 08:12:16,980
Yeah, no, this final room fucking shops.

7891
08:12:17,480 --> 08:12:18,920
Like, it fucking sucks.

7892
08:12:20,000 --> 08:12:20,420
Yeah.

7893
08:12:22,240 --> 08:12:23,840
It actually fucking sucks.

7894
08:12:26,500 --> 08:12:28,860
Like, of all the fucking rooms I get.

7895
08:12:32,360 --> 08:12:34,700
Like, I don't need any of this, okay.

7896
08:12:38,580 --> 08:12:39,820
Okay, more HP.

7897
08:12:40,020 --> 08:12:41,300
I'll just grab the HP.

7898
08:12:51,440 --> 08:12:52,440
I guess.

7899
08:12:53,160 --> 08:12:54,300
With the grace of the moon.

7900
08:12:55,620 --> 08:12:56,000
Alright.

7901
08:12:57,820 --> 08:12:59,420
I might as well buy it.

7902
08:12:59,940 --> 08:13:00,960
Is that it?

7903
08:13:02,080 --> 08:13:09,560
your titan's stolen fortress beckons for the moment
undefended and exposed either because his forces have been

7904
08:13:09,560 --> 08:13:22,420
scattered or his certainty of victory complete or perhaps
both all right i mean i don't know arois is not here i don't

7905
08:13:22,420 --> 08:13:27,060
know this i don't like my build at all i actually i hate my
build

7906
08:13:33,640 --> 08:13:36,020
You are too young to know what it was like.

7907
08:13:36,960 --> 08:13:40,120
Before the gods reshape the world to be like this.

7908
08:13:41,300 --> 08:13:46,080
Mortals did not have to die in agony and waste away within
this pit.

7909
08:13:47,360 --> 08:13:48,560
A simpler age.

7910
08:13:48,740 --> 08:13:51,060
Didn't you eat people?

7911
08:13:54,340 --> 08:13:56,480
Yeah, I was like, don't you eat?

7912
08:13:56,620 --> 08:13:58,200
Aren't you a fucking catapult?

7913
08:13:58,600 --> 08:13:59,240
Look, then your own.

7914
08:13:59,780 --> 08:14:01,360
You went to war with your own children.

7915
08:14:01,920 --> 08:14:03,620
Yeah, we don't talk about it.

7916
08:14:03,640 --> 08:14:10,540
That justice yeah, how is that how is that better?

7917
08:14:11,340 --> 08:14:15,140
My offspring and my other charges did not always take good
to discipline.

7918
08:14:16,020 --> 08:14:19,180
I had too many to look after to take cheek from anyone.

7919
08:14:20,620 --> 08:14:21,780
And you my girl.

7920
08:14:22,000 --> 08:14:22,980
Bro, that's your fault.

7921
08:14:23,400 --> 08:14:23,400
Stop.

7922
08:14:25,820 --> 08:14:28,480
Should you have used contraception, bro?

7923
08:14:28,700 --> 08:14:31,920
If you don't want to take care of all those kids, that's on
you.

7924
08:14:33,640 --> 08:14:49,160
Children for having too much That's on you, bro, you wanted
all those kids You didn't have to take all those kids Oh my

7925
08:14:49,160 --> 08:14:55,400

08:15:18,940 --> 08:15:20,580
There you go.

7929
08:15:23,200 --> 08:15:24,420
There you go.

Mobs are so annoying!

7932
08:15:40,250 --> 08:15:41,430
Oh my god.

7933
08:15:42,570 --> 08:15:43,490
Oh, no.

7934
08:15:43,990 --> 08:15:44,510
Uh-uh.

Okay, it's five.

7936
08:15:50,640 --> 08:15:51,460
Oh, never mind.

7937
08:15:53,240 --> 08:15:54,300
Are you serious?

7938
08:15:54,660 --> 08:15:55,360
That hits me?

7939
08:15:56,360 --> 08:15:57,680
Okay, that's bullshit.

7940
08:16:00,100 --> 08:16:01,360
That's bullshit.

7941
08:16:03,020 --> 08:16:04,380
That shouldn't have hit me.

7942
08:16:06,880 --> 08:16:08,560
Are you fucking kidding me?

7943
08:16:08,900 --> 08:16:09,700
Oh, my God.

7944
08:16:09,800 --> 08:16:10,880
It hit me so many times.

7945
08:16:12,400 --> 08:16:13,340
Oh, my God.

7946
08:16:13,520 --> 08:16:15,380
I'm hitting everything right now.

7947
08:16:19,840 --> 08:16:21,080
Oh, I'm so unlucky.

7948
08:16:23,260 --> 08:16:25,500
Oh, no, not these guys, though.

7949
08:16:26,180 --> 08:16:28,880
These guys are the worst for the spawn.

7950
08:16:31,820 --> 08:16:32,500
Oh, no.

7951
08:16:34,520 --> 08:16:35,440
Oh, no.

7952
08:16:37,360 --> 08:16:39,120
I'm trying to get rid of him.

No!

7954
08:16:39,900 --> 08:16:41,040
A fucking curse!

7956
08:16:48,000 --> 08:16:48,680

08:18:28,160 --> 08:18:31,080
You make an enemy of all my legions, not just me.

7972
08:18:31,240 --> 08:18:31,460
Oh.

7973
08:18:33,540 --> 08:18:34,140
Okay.

7974
08:18:37,020 --> 08:18:37,620
Okay.

7975
08:18:38,780 --> 08:18:40,000
I healed.

7976
08:18:42,700 --> 08:18:44,600
Oh my god.

7977
08:18:50,790 --> 08:18:52,630
Oh my god.

7978
08:18:53,510 --> 08:18:53,930
Please.

7979
08:19:25,660 --> 08:19:27,140
I hate this.

7980
08:19:27,840 --> 08:19:29,260
I hate this so much.

7981
08:19:38,860 --> 08:19:39,820
Oh my god.

7982
08:19:40,300 --> 08:19:42,000
I'm like so fucking focused.

7983
08:19:47,110 --> 08:19:48,070
I'm...

7984
08:19:48,070 --> 08:19:48,470
Please.

7985
08:20:05,230 --> 08:20:06,810
I was on.

7986
08:20:06,830 --> 08:20:07,670
I'm the thing!

7987
08:20:08,610 --> 08:20:11,330
None could resist the ravages of time.

7988
08:20:12,010 --> 08:20:13,510
But you, how?

7989
08:20:14,190 --> 08:20:15,350
Oh my god, it did it.

7990
08:20:15,970 --> 08:20:18,570
Oh, I was so locked in.

7991
08:20:19,230 --> 08:20:20,890
Oh, please don't tell me.

7992
08:20:21,130 --> 08:20:23,450
No, please don't tell me there's a third phase.

7993
08:20:24,470 --> 08:20:26,230
And I'll collect the icka from your veins.

7994
08:20:26,690 --> 08:20:28,730
Or whatever flows through them.

7995
08:20:29,230 --> 08:20:29,350
Oh.

7996
08:20:33,320 --> 08:20:35,540
What is death to the deathless?

7997
08:20:36,540 --> 08:20:37,520
A mere nuisance.

7998
08:20:38,200 --> 08:20:39,260
Oh my god, did I do it?

7999
08:20:40,600 --> 08:20:41,520
Did I do it?

8000
08:20:41,520 --> 08:20:44,200
Once I am gone, you shall be cast away.

8001
08:20:46,620 --> 08:20:50,000
No, don't say that.

8002
08:20:51,120 --> 08:20:52,520
Don't say that!

8003
08:20:52,940 --> 08:20:56,180
And I'll slay you again and again and again if I must.

8004
08:20:58,540 --> 08:21:04,420
Even if in so doing, it meant that you would never see your
dear old family again.

8005
08:21:05,280 --> 08:21:10,960
Because the mercy I have shown to them thus far It's
something I may have to re-evaluate.

8006
08:21:13,180 --> 08:21:14,300
Our family.

8007
08:21:15,220 --> 08:21:16,000
And what do I care?

8008
08:21:16,420 --> 08:21:17,440
I don't even know them.

8009
08:21:18,220 --> 08:21:20,860
Because I do know you will be dead here in another moment.

8010
08:21:21,640 --> 08:21:22,640
Any last words?

8011
08:21:24,040 --> 08:21:25,500
For you, my girl.

8012
08:21:26,520 --> 08:21:28,020
A mere reminder.

8013
08:21:29,340 --> 08:21:30,320
Having more.

8014
08:21:32,740 --> 08:21:33,540
I have this.

8015
08:21:33,560 --> 08:21:34,300
Oh my god.

8016
08:21:34,660 --> 08:21:36,180
I can't notice this.

8017
08:21:36,180 --> 08:21:39,280
Thank fucking god.

8018
08:21:39,500 --> 08:21:40,660
Look, look, you see that?

8019
08:21:41,360 --> 08:21:42,400
Eris isn't here?

8020
08:21:42,780 --> 08:21:43,520
You see that?

8021
08:21:44,240 --> 08:21:45,200
Oh, wow!

8022
08:21:46,140 --> 08:21:48,080
Eris didn't show up!

8023
08:21:48,360 --> 08:21:50,380
And then I win the...

8024
08:21:50,380 --> 08:21:54,420
This was the shittiest build I've had thus far.

8025
08:21:54,760 --> 08:21:58,780
But because Eris wasn't there, I win.

8026
08:22:00,320 --> 08:22:03,240
This was the worst build I had.

8027
08:22:03,600 --> 08:22:05,640
But oh, no Eris.

8028
08:22:08,700 --> 08:22:21,140

8030
08:22:25,500 --> 08:22:34,800
enter the room do I click this or enter the room on there's
like a golden room there

8031
08:22:37,860 --> 08:22:39,700
Oh, no.

8032
08:22:43,550 --> 08:22:43,990
Click it.

8033
08:22:44,170 --> 08:22:45,070
Examine it first?

8034
08:22:45,770 --> 08:22:47,210
The remains of time.

8035
08:22:48,570 --> 08:22:50,910
Eris bless Kronos this time.

8036
08:22:51,590 --> 08:22:51,970
Absolutely.

8037
08:22:52,270 --> 08:22:54,150
Thank you for the super chat.

8038
08:22:54,570 --> 08:22:55,430
Thank you.

8039
08:22:55,470 --> 08:22:56,270
Thank you.

8040
08:22:57,190 --> 08:22:58,850
The princess chambers.

8041
08:22:59,150 --> 08:23:01,350
Oh, that's my brother's chambers.

8042
08:23:01,610 --> 08:23:02,310
Oh, Jesus.

8043
08:23:03,230 --> 08:23:04,030
Bro.

8044
08:23:05,090 --> 08:23:05,630
Bro.

8045
08:23:06,030 --> 08:23:07,090
That's your cousin.

8046
08:23:07,530 --> 08:23:07,930
Bro.

8047
08:23:09,470 --> 08:23:10,810
Bro, that's like...

8048
08:23:10,830 --> 08:23:22,930
weird bro and sweet old alabama bro that's your cousin to
the abyss of the subconscious i descend and he's a healthy

8049

step two night and darkness guide me to my blood beyond the

8050
08:23:37,050 --> 08:23:44,910
grasp of time Greek so it's okay.

8051
08:23:45,270 --> 08:23:45,910
Please.

8052
08:23:54,370 --> 08:23:54,610
Brother?

8053
08:23:56,110 --> 08:24:02,110
Is my hair getting lighter and my features getting fairer or
did I consume something that really isn't sitting well?

8054
08:24:03,530 --> 08:24:05,650
Prince Agrius, please listen to my voice.

8055
08:24:06,150 --> 08:24:06,830
Can you hear me?

8056
08:24:07,290 --> 08:24:08,010
Can you hear me?

8057
08:24:08,470 --> 08:24:09,690
Sweet home Athens.

8058
08:24:10,210 --> 08:24:11,210
Sweet home Athens.

8059
08:24:11,510 --> 08:24:12,890
Definitely something I consume then.

8060
08:24:14,410 --> 08:24:22,870
this is just a dream hypnosis has been growing rather bold
with these is that you and their mate I'm your sister no I

8061
08:24:22,870 --> 08:24:29,790
look yes technically this is a dream but it's the only way I
could reach out to you across the span of time now please

8062
08:24:29,790 --> 08:24:37,330
our family is in danger and I need your aid all right all
right slow down it's fortunate I rather like such realistic

8063
08:24:37,330 --> 08:24:45,810
dreams and what do you mean our family who are you probably
one of mother's many cousins wouldn't explain eyes though or

8064
08:24:45,810 --> 08:24:53,530
my father's sigil on your outfit let me speak look this is
going to be difficult for you to accept but I'm millennial

8065
08:24:53,530 --> 08:25:06,370
that's right your dad your mom got it on that's right see
that was going to be my next guess well dream sister from a

8066
08:25:06,370 --> 08:25:13,570
future time I would never want to snap a wait before hearing
you out so what's the situation what do you want me to do I

8067
08:25:13,570 --> 08:25:20,130
want you to grandfather Kronos and destroy him because
there's only so much I can do here myself he's I'm gonna

8068
08:25:20,130 --> 08:25:27,310
have to play Cyrus again imprisoned our father mother you
everybody and now he threatens Olympus all his vengeance for

8069
08:25:27,310 --> 08:25:35,170
what the gods once did right when you say what the gods once
did you mean the part where they got rid of Kronos

8070
08:25:35,170 --> 08:25:41,350
permanently long before I was ever born or you for that
matter but in the not all that distant future he returns and

8071
08:25:41,350 --> 08:25:45,130
single-handedly takes over everything yeah Exactly.

8072
08:25:48,290 --> 08:25:54,510
If Doki had a gun with two bullets and was in a room with
typhoons, Kronos, and Ares, Doki would shoot Ares twice.

8073
08:25:55,390 --> 08:25:55,830
Exactly.

8074
08:25:56,710 --> 08:25:58,250
Warren, thank you for the super chat.

8075
08:25:58,270 --> 08:25:58,730
Thank you.

8076
08:25:58,790 --> 08:25:59,350
Thank you.

8077
08:26:00,010 --> 08:26:02,330
I myself was very little when the titans struck.

8078
08:26:02,770 --> 08:26:03,390
Oh, wait.

8079
08:26:03,490 --> 08:26:04,570
I'm going to be playing Zagros.

8080
08:26:05,070 --> 08:26:05,370
This very moment.

8081
08:26:06,130 --> 08:26:07,790
But I cannot stop Kronos on my own.

8082
08:26:07,890 --> 08:26:09,690
We need a mod.

8083
08:26:09,830 --> 08:26:11,690
I should have downloaded a mod that removed Ares.

8084
08:26:11,990 --> 08:26:14,110
This stream would have been like six hours.

8085
08:26:14,410 --> 08:26:15,790
Like, like, shorter.

8086
08:26:17,430 --> 08:26:20,870
I literally think I could have beat this game in two to
three hours.

8087
08:26:21,250 --> 08:26:23,250
If Eris didn't fucking cuck me.

8088
08:26:26,190 --> 08:26:29,690
I should have installed a mod that fucking took Eris out.

8089
08:26:31,830 --> 08:26:36,190
Also, you look and sound just like a figment of my
imagination would probably look and sound.

8090
08:26:36,790 --> 08:26:38,170
Can you prove anything you've said?

8091
08:26:40,900 --> 08:26:42,920
You won't forget me when you wake, I promise you.

8092
08:26:43,260 --> 08:26:45,540
As for the proof you seek, you must know of Hecatee.

8093
08:26:46,100 --> 08:26:50,820
Handmaiden she trained me for this seek her and tell her
what I've said, but no one else

8094
08:26:54,780 --> 08:27:01,280
Um sister i'm afraid our mother has no such handmaiden
Although in some strange way you mentioning a name i've

8095
08:27:01,280 --> 08:27:05,500
never heard is better proof than anything you've said to me
thus far Oh, what's the matter?

8096
08:27:05,740 --> 08:27:07,420
Oh, what happened?

8097
08:27:12,820 --> 08:27:19,120
It's chronos i've incapacitated him, but he'll return just
as he will eventually in your own time I need to go.

8098
08:27:19,740 --> 08:27:21,220
Before he finds me here, I need to go.

8099
08:27:22,800 --> 08:27:23,720
What you just got here?

8100
08:27:24,100 --> 08:27:25,700
Look, Malinui, was it?

8101
08:27:26,200 --> 08:27:28,320
Will I ever see you again, or was this more of a one-off?

8102
08:27:29,600 --> 08:27:31,000
Yeah, will we see each other again?

8103
08:27:31,140 --> 08:27:32,920
I found you across dreams and time, brother.

8104
08:27:33,140 --> 08:27:34,440
I'll stop at nothing to do it again.

8105
08:27:34,540 --> 08:27:36,760
Why don't I just mess with the...

8106
08:27:36,760 --> 08:27:36,900
Tad?

8107
08:27:37,300 --> 08:27:39,540
Like, I would stop to exist, though.

8108
08:27:40,200 --> 08:27:41,520
Right, I can't even tell Hypnos.

8109
08:27:42,180 --> 08:27:42,960
I'll suit yourself.

8110
08:27:43,440 --> 08:27:44,580
See you another day, sister.

8111
08:27:45,380 --> 08:27:47,860
Wouldn't I, like, stop to exist if he succeeded?

8112
08:27:47,880 --> 08:27:56,380
Like we're fucking doing going through this paradox of
memory return to shadow now Yeah, but then this version of

8113
08:27:56,380 --> 08:28:08,120
her it won't exist though I found him I meant this version
Wait, how come I couldn't examine chronos vanquished and

8114
08:28:08,120 --> 08:28:17,080
after that you'd not believe it anyhow Hold on what's going
on with you never seen you so excited in my life death

8115
08:28:17,080 --> 08:28:25,540
whatever what did you discover a new species of root
vegetable or something dora i found him chronos and i beat

8116
08:28:25,540 --> 08:28:34,280
him withstood every trick he had until he yielded and
expired no do not say that do not do not say i gotta be

8117
08:28:34,280 --> 08:28:46,600
chronos and more time don't do this to me he isn't dead i
mean he isn't gone not yet i have to go all right not again

8118
08:28:47,880 --> 08:29:02,100
all good we not no not again just like 80s no how far were
you able to go last night princess uh i sensed growing fear

8119
08:29:02,100 --> 08:29:10,220
and excitement in the air even heard some of the rumblings
if the rumblings were that i reached the depths of tartarus

8120
08:29:10,220 --> 08:29:17,080
broken to my father's stolen house confronted chronos there
and out fought him and you heard correctly don't do this day

8121
08:29:19,300 --> 08:29:27,100
The thing is, I could have, I could have been able to beat
up 10 more times if there wasn't that bitch.

8122
08:29:29,600 --> 08:29:33,800
By the 8 hour mark, we would have been beating up 10 more
times.

8123
08:29:34,120 --> 08:29:38,240
Is this not a vitally important component of the task you've
been interested to complete?

8124
08:29:39,900 --> 08:29:41,620
God damn, fuck years.

8125
08:29:42,240 --> 08:29:43,920
Well, yes, it is, but...

8126
08:29:44,540 --> 08:29:45,400
Then congratulations.

8127
08:29:46,000 --> 08:29:47,000
Oh, a thousand.

8128
08:29:47,300 --> 08:29:47,860
Jesus Christ.

8129
08:29:49,300 --> 08:29:50,020
Okay.

8130
08:29:53,180 --> 08:29:54,620
All right.

8131
08:29:57,080 --> 08:29:58,820
What do I have?

8132
08:30:00,280 --> 08:30:02,960
Oh, moon dust.

8133
08:30:03,160 --> 08:30:05,560
I mean, that's good.

8134
08:30:06,380 --> 08:30:09,040
Cause, nah, let's grab it.

8135
08:30:09,400 --> 08:30:13,100
By light of moon, together, let us shape reality.

8136
08:30:14,720 --> 08:30:17,400
I love toxic Yuri, but this isn't it.

8137
08:30:17,880 --> 08:30:31,700
a water of ashes beneath which i stand fulfill your purpose
that i know firsthand what else is that everything i think

8138
08:30:31,700 --> 08:30:45,320
that's everything i can make right yeah i made so much
already fucking you did it that's me some new shade i think

8139
08:30:45,320 --> 08:30:50,280
i did it Oh, hey, wait, I don't remember seeing.

8140
08:30:52,660 --> 08:30:54,140
Wait, oh my god.

8141
08:30:54,420 --> 08:30:55,140
Hello, guys.

8142
08:30:55,280 --> 08:30:56,840
Where did you guys come from?

8143
08:30:57,980 --> 08:30:58,580
You're back.

8144
08:30:59,580 --> 08:31:00,820
Now, tell me everything.

8145
08:31:01,220 --> 08:31:01,960
You found your mark.

8146
08:31:02,660 --> 08:31:03,040
What then?

8147
08:31:03,360 --> 08:31:04,360
I did it.

8148
08:31:04,720 --> 08:31:08,280
I reached the edge of Tartarus and made my way into the
house just as we planned.

8149
08:31:08,960 --> 08:31:11,200
Kronos was there on my father's throne.

8150
08:31:11,780 --> 08:31:13,500
Yeah, he finally lost.

8151
08:31:14,980 --> 08:31:16,140
But I know he isn't gone.

8152
08:31:16,820 --> 08:31:17,860
And I was unable to link.

8153
08:31:17,880 --> 08:31:25,520
there for long yeah he reconstructed himself i should cut
him to pieces man we were never going to destroy the titan

8154
08:31:25,520 --> 08:31:37,300
with brute force alone but soon enough he may yet be undone
entirely provided you have more good tidings to report the

8155
08:31:37,300 --> 08:31:43,340
mirror was intact abandoned in the princess chambers and the
incantation worked i found my brother in the past and spoke

8156
08:31:43,340 --> 08:31:47,720
to him but had so little time I barely managed to convince
him as to who I am.

8157
08:31:49,360 --> 08:31:52,000
Then speak swiftly the next opportunity you get.

8158
08:31:52,360 --> 08:31:52,720
Oh my god.

8159
08:31:52,960 --> 08:31:56,700
Every time I kill him, I have to, like, tell him how to
fucking kill our grandpa.

8160
08:31:57,160 --> 08:31:58,200
As for the Titan.

8161
08:31:58,460 --> 08:31:59,180
I should have just like...

8162
08:32:00,120 --> 08:32:02,160
I shall study what you found.

8163
08:32:02,580 --> 08:32:04,440
I should just write a fucking Gatbro.

8164
08:32:04,660 --> 08:32:06,360
I wish he had a camera, man.

8165
08:32:06,860 --> 08:32:07,640
I can't...

8166
08:32:09,580 --> 08:32:13,100
Why didn't the Greeks back then invented a camera?

8167
08:32:13,440 --> 08:32:15,240
I could have wrote everything down.

8168
08:32:15,260 --> 08:32:17,880
I'll be like, okay, take a picture of this real quick.

8169
08:32:18,240 --> 08:32:20,940
This is how you can kill our grandpa.

8170
08:32:21,400 --> 08:32:23,200
Yeah, God damn it!

8171
08:32:24,120 --> 08:32:24,640
Zagreus.

8172
08:32:26,800 --> 08:32:28,280
You proved beyond a doubt.

8173
08:32:28,280 --> 08:32:32,340
You're a god, but you can't even fucking invent a camera.

8174
08:32:32,740 --> 08:32:33,960
Put up a QR code, yeah.

8175
08:32:34,320 --> 08:32:35,540
And put up a QR code.

8176
08:32:35,800 --> 08:32:38,280
Like, invent the worldwide web.

8177
08:32:38,520 --> 08:32:43,860
And then link it to, like, a step-by-step YouTube video on
how to kill our grandpa.

8178
08:32:47,420 --> 08:32:54,060
If only you had photographic memories, Zagreus, so that I
could just put right at all on a piece of fucking paper.

8179
08:32:55,620 --> 08:32:56,660
You're useless, bro.

8180
08:32:56,920 --> 08:32:57,820
Oh, Mother Nix, my lord.

8181
08:32:58,460 --> 08:33:00,600
I saw her lately in a nightmare or a dream.

8182
08:33:01,560 --> 08:33:02,300
She was very beautiful.

8183
08:33:02,520 --> 08:33:05,080
Yeah, but why didn't the Greeks just take out their iPhones?

8184
08:33:12,610 --> 08:33:14,550
Oh, wait, you're my stepbrother?

8185
08:33:15,510 --> 08:33:16,210
I forgot.

8186
08:33:17,750 --> 08:33:19,870
I forgot she was my stepbrother.

8187
08:33:19,890 --> 08:33:20,250
brother.

8188
08:33:20,370 --> 08:33:20,890
You got there.

8189
08:33:20,890 --> 08:33:22,150
Had one of my dreams, Nem.

8190
08:33:22,890 --> 08:33:25,430
Your mother was there and my father.

8191
08:33:26,430 --> 08:33:27,850
He showed concern for her.

8192
08:33:28,090 --> 08:33:30,670
She was under the titan's spell.

8193
08:33:31,250 --> 08:33:32,810
Wait, oh, no wonder we hate each other.

8194
08:33:32,910 --> 08:33:34,150
You're my step-sister, too.

8195
08:33:36,170 --> 08:33:39,870
Mother Nix made a mistake in trusting Hades with so much of
the underworld.

8196
08:33:40,810 --> 08:33:45,010
This realm was never his by right, not till the fates
decided otherwise.

8197
08:33:45,810 --> 08:33:46,690
Mother worked hard.

8198
08:33:47,250 --> 08:33:49,410
They were probably just trying to send her help.

8199
08:33:50,450 --> 08:33:56,470
you're saying the fates granted my father authority over the
realm of the dead just to give nicks a hand with yeah wasn't

8200
08:33:56,470 --> 08:34:08,730
nicks my stepmom that's right huh you caught him didn't you
he killed the bastard for one night at least the first

8201
08:34:08,730 --> 08:34:16,810
report I heard I scarce believed but by the third or fourth
I'd come around well done goddess yes it was staggering

8202
08:34:16,810 --> 08:34:24,930
stepmom I'd not be surprised if our reports already say he's
returned but i got what i needed for now and a little bit of

8203
08:34:24,930 --> 08:34:36,210
payback i suppose yeah so that's my subsister but even
though we're not there yet we needed this i think you needed

8204
08:34:36,210 --> 08:34:49,960
this yeah i do i needed this i fucking needed him i needed
him to die after all the errors put me through i mustn't

8205
08:34:49,960 --> 08:34:56,100
speak of this lord hypnosis but I was able to descend to the
abyss of the subconscious, and I found my brother there.

8206
08:34:56,900 --> 08:34:58,900
Thank you for sparking my fascination with dream.

8207
08:34:59,560 --> 08:35:00,780
All that I've worked for.

8208
08:35:01,240 --> 08:35:02,900
Last night, it felt in reach.

8209
08:35:04,520 --> 08:35:06,260
It's like my little therapy animal.

8210
08:35:09,060 --> 08:35:17,140
A finely chiseled countenance of the underworld's unseated
king instills a sense of quiet contemplation and resolve in

8211
08:35:17,140 --> 08:35:20,940
whosoever dares to meet those stone unseeing eyes.

8212
08:35:22,000 --> 08:35:34,680
all right yeah i'm so happy oh it can't be that's what's
that the oath of the unseen oh it's to make the runs harder

8213
08:35:34,680 --> 08:35:43,560
as if my oh my runs weren't fucking me too what unbearable
already okay man i'll need to unlock the full potential of

8214
08:35:43,560 --> 08:35:54,900
each of your cards oh what inside does it increase it more
wait what does it do So that's it.

8215
08:35:56,120 --> 08:35:56,760
Wait, what?

8216
08:36:05,340 --> 08:36:05,840
Enter?

8217
08:36:08,080 --> 08:36:08,600
Oh!

8218
08:36:11,940 --> 08:36:15,360
What do I even upgrade, I feel like?

8219
08:36:15,860 --> 08:36:16,920
What is good?

8220
08:36:20,840 --> 08:36:22,600
What would you guys upgrade, chat?

8221
08:36:23,700 --> 08:36:24,220
HP?

8222
08:36:25,140 --> 08:36:25,880
Which one?

8223
08:36:26,260 --> 08:36:29,040
Like, this one?

8224
08:36:32,970 --> 08:36:34,390
The Hades one.

8225
08:36:37,880 --> 08:36:39,620
Where the fuck is the...

8226
08:36:40,980 --> 08:36:42,580
Save for Death Defiance?

8227
08:36:43,540 --> 08:36:44,420
Oh, I should.

8228
08:36:44,780 --> 08:36:46,100
Yeah, I'll save it.

8229
08:36:46,900 --> 08:36:48,080
I'll save it for that.

8230
08:36:48,260 --> 08:36:48,780
The Arcana.

8231
08:36:49,500 --> 08:36:50,540
I finally understand.

8232
08:36:54,010 --> 08:36:56,090
I mean, I can finally grab three.

8233
08:36:56,250 --> 08:36:57,690
Wait, fucking, I guess not.

8234
08:37:00,050 --> 08:37:00,630
Okay.

8235
08:37:02,130 --> 08:37:03,630
Don't think I can do this.

8236
08:37:03,970 --> 08:37:04,870
No, I can.

8237
08:37:04,970 --> 08:37:05,970
And then I can grab...

8238
08:37:05,990 --> 08:37:18,990
this that's fine I got the centaur now I'm okay with that
what do I oh what wait

8239
08:37:22,950 --> 08:37:35,700
that's crazy I'll grab that actually okay we'll try and
upgrade the con actually

8240
08:37:44,010 --> 08:37:46,870
I feel like Zeus would be the best right

8241
08:37:52,500 --> 08:37:53,180
Yeah.

8242
08:37:54,020 --> 08:37:58,360
I go to Olympus now?

8243
08:37:59,740 --> 08:38:01,300
In shadow I serve.

8244
08:38:01,740 --> 08:38:03,300
To shadow I return.

8245
08:38:06,200 --> 08:38:06,860
Yeah, no.

8246
08:38:09,360 --> 08:38:10,500
No, that's fine.

8247
08:38:11,660 --> 08:38:14,500
I don't need to do that.

8248
08:38:14,840 --> 08:38:22,260
Full moon flares, bestowing all her grace and power from
beyond an earthly canopy of trees and soaring precipices.

8249
08:38:22,500 --> 08:38:29,700
which provide a pristine vantage point how the fuck do i
unlock olympus the crossroads between realms

8250
08:38:33,800 --> 08:38:40,660
the moon is full why do i have to do it your eyes do not
deceive near the gateways out of here you'll find none other

8251
08:38:40,660 --> 08:38:48,260
than the oath of the unseen i think it's called ask me not
whence it came instead ask just how tough you really are by

8252
08:38:48,260 --> 08:38:59,480
three of the fabric go to the cauldron okay i earned of
night do I dare speak the vows and thereby spread the fear

8253
08:38:59,480 --> 08:39:05,820
that darkness brings I'm like slosh back on my chair after
that those nocturnal arms you got they probably gonna love

8254
08:39:05,820 --> 08:39:13,440
that fear and testament type stuff I say give it a shot much
the worst it could happen all mortal kind condemned to

8255
08:39:13,440 --> 08:39:20,620
never-ending torment and I mean mortal kind we're not
mortals we're fine it's gonna be fine yeah see look it's

8256
08:39:20,620 --> 08:39:26,580
gonna be fine we're not mortals so it doesn't affect us
Okay, so it's in the cauldron.

8257
08:39:26,940 --> 08:39:27,680
Okay, let me check.

8258
08:39:28,380 --> 08:39:30,500
Must be an incantation that can help.

8259
08:39:31,720 --> 08:39:32,500
Oh, is this?

8260
08:39:33,180 --> 08:39:34,700
I don't have shadow gas.

8261
08:39:34,840 --> 08:39:39,160
Okay, I need three fabric and 30 ash.

8262
08:39:39,300 --> 08:39:40,420
Okay, I have enough of that.

8263
08:39:42,320 --> 08:39:42,780
Okay.

8264
08:39:44,500 --> 08:39:45,920
One, two, three.

8265
08:39:46,780 --> 08:39:49,120
And then 30 ash.

8266
08:39:52,500 --> 08:39:52,920
Done.

8267
08:39:53,740 --> 08:39:54,300
There you go.

8268
08:39:55,720 --> 08:39:56,440
It's...

8269
08:39:56,440 --> 08:39:58,220
And then we'll grab...

8270
08:39:58,220 --> 08:39:59,400
We need one shadow.

8271
08:40:00,580 --> 08:40:02,040
Essence is a shadow.

8272
08:40:04,520 --> 08:40:05,600
It's cooking.

8273
08:40:07,040 --> 08:40:07,740

It needs to cook.

8277
08:40:19,440 --> 08:40:20,320
What the fuck?

8278
08:40:20,580 --> 08:40:23,240
A death-like parra emanates now from the arms of night.

8279
08:40:23,740 --> 08:40:24,900
Or one of them at least.

Or is that nine minutes?

8295
08:41:29,050 --> 08:41:30,150
That's nine minutes, isn't it?

8296
08:41:30,470 --> 08:41:31,630
I was gonna say.

8297
08:41:32,390 --> 08:41:33,110
This I vow.

8298
08:41:34,470 --> 08:41:36,250

8299
08:41:37,110 --> 08:41:37,950
Or nine minutes?

8300
08:41:38,030 --> 08:41:39,910
Okay, now I was gonna say nine hours.

8301
08:41:42,570 --> 08:41:43,230
Let's do that.

8302
08:41:43,370 --> 08:41:44,210
Okay, it's fine.

8303

8319
08:42:39,360 --> 08:42:40,240
We don't need it.

8320
08:42:43,520 --> 08:42:44,220
Okay, it's fine.

08:51:10,960 --> 08:51:22,540
my build is actually surprisingly very strong i was not
expecting that i i was i actually was not expecting a decent

8435
08:51:22,540 --> 08:51:25,720
build like i have been like bullshitting this build

8436
08:51:28,760 --> 08:51:36,820

build for this one I'll deepen your understanding.

8438
08:51:45,920 --> 08:51:47,400
The aspects of night and darkness.

8439
08:51:47,660 --> 08:51:48,080
Oh, nice.

8440
08:51:48,440 --> 08:51:49,560
Got another incantation.

8441
08:51:50,000 --> 08:51:50,040
Yay!

8442
08:51:51,100 --> 08:51:53,260
Okay, the worst part is I'm timed, though.

8443
08:51:53,460 --> 08:51:56,100
So, like, I'm not feeling so good about this.

8444
08:51:56,860 --> 08:51:58,480
Because of the fact that I'm tied.

8445
08:52:02,760 --> 08:52:03,280
Alright.

8446
08:52:04,220 --> 08:52:05,180
Oh, my God.

8447
08:52:05,340 --> 08:52:05,620
Please.

8448
08:52:06,760 --> 08:52:07,500
Oh, my God.

8449
08:52:07,560 --> 08:52:09,060
I'm timed right now, please.

8450
08:52:13,190 --> 08:52:22,830
the bones I'll get the boon which rock did you crawl out
from under my forces they are terribly confused they have no

8451
08:52:22,830 --> 08:52:34,910
idea where you live so I thought I would attempt asking you
nicely here that's right I'll never tell that's why I won't

8452
08:52:34,910 --> 08:52:36,710
I could put you in a home, Granddad!

8453
08:52:38,070 --> 08:52:39,810
However long it takes.

8454
08:52:41,790 --> 08:52:43,170
However long it takes.

8455
08:52:44,050 --> 08:52:46,430
You speak of inevitability, little one.

8456
08:52:47,210 --> 08:52:49,410
A subject on which I happen to be the expert.

8457
08:52:50,530 --> 08:52:54,410
As to whomever sent you after me, I shall find them.

8458
08:52:54,530 --> 08:52:55,150
Oh shit.

8459
08:52:56,110 --> 08:52:57,270
Okay, we gotta get Regent.

8460
08:52:57,390 --> 08:53:00,210
If we're actually doing this build, we need Regent real bad.

8461
08:53:02,550 --> 08:53:03,470
Okay, nice.

8462
08:53:09,430 --> 08:53:11,550
I mean, that's the hard part.

8463
08:53:13,610 --> 08:53:16,070
We don't have like mana regen for this build.

8464
08:53:17,310 --> 08:53:20,530
And that's like the only thing that would make our build
like really strong.

8465
08:53:24,490 --> 08:53:25,310
Alright, nice.

8466
08:53:26,110 --> 08:53:26,470
Okay.

8467
08:53:29,850 --> 08:53:32,790
Oh my god, I literally just need regen.

8468
08:53:33,690 --> 08:53:34,350
That's it.

8469
08:53:36,990 --> 08:53:37,990
All right, nice.

8470
08:53:42,810 --> 08:53:43,330
Nectar.

8471
08:53:43,890 --> 08:53:44,190
Nectar.

8472
08:53:44,590 --> 08:53:44,590
Oh,

8473
08:53:47,670 --> 08:53:48,050
my God.

8474
08:53:48,250 --> 08:53:49,570
What am I looking at?

8475
08:53:51,210 --> 08:53:52,130
Oh, my.

8476
08:53:52,510 --> 08:53:54,490
I mean, it's a lot of damage, though.

8477
08:53:55,190 --> 08:53:57,010
But still, what the fuck?

8478
08:53:59,490 --> 08:54:00,330
Be not afraid.

8479
08:54:00,510 --> 08:54:00,750
All right.

8480
08:54:09,750 --> 08:54:10,210
There you go.

8481
08:54:11,010 --> 08:54:14,790
Oh my- Actually, my brain has to go on overtime for that.

8482
08:54:18,410 --> 08:54:19,890
I have to go overtime.

8483
08:54:21,330 --> 08:54:23,670
Uh, moon or cha- I don't have money.

8484
08:54:23,790 --> 08:54:24,670
I'm fucking broke.

8485
08:54:27,210 --> 08:54:30,430
No, I need mana regen really badly.

8486
08:54:33,830 --> 08:54:39,310
Like, for this build to work, I need to figure- I need to
find something that can regen my mana.

8487
08:54:41,470 --> 08:54:43,610
Yeah, collect reward.

8488
08:54:46,010 --> 08:54:48,570
What the fuck is this path?

8489
08:54:49,090 --> 08:54:49,370
Okay.

8490
08:54:51,030 --> 08:54:52,510
Alright, let's see.

8491
08:55:03,640 --> 08:55:06,480
Uh, let's just grab this real quick.

8492
08:55:09,840 --> 08:55:11,140
Gain plus 8 now.

8493
08:55:11,720 --> 08:55:12,800
Enter Chaos Gate.

8494
08:55:13,060 --> 08:55:14,660
It costs $0 to enter.

8495
08:55:16,160 --> 08:55:19,280
I have to restore 50% of your...

8496
08:55:19,280 --> 08:55:20,480
Oh my god.

8497
08:55:21,200 --> 08:55:21,900
Do I...

8498
08:55:21,900 --> 08:55:22,300
Fuck.

8499
08:55:22,520 --> 08:55:23,720
Do I want another Chaos Gate?

8500
08:55:24,380 --> 08:55:25,180
What do I get here?

8501
08:55:25,240 --> 08:55:25,880
Let's get health.

8502
08:55:25,980 --> 08:55:26,440
Fuck it.

8503
08:55:26,720 --> 08:55:27,740
Oh, I should have got mana.

8504
08:55:28,220 --> 08:55:32,960
Oh, I should have got mana on.

8505
08:55:34,400 --> 08:55:34,800
Oopsie.

8506
08:55:35,140 --> 08:55:36,620
Maybe I should have got mana.

8507
08:55:39,700 --> 08:55:40,480
Okay, it's fine.

8508
08:55:42,340 --> 08:55:42,920
That's okay.

8509
08:55:43,100 --> 08:55:44,580
Maybe health would be good for me.

8510
08:55:44,780 --> 08:55:45,060
Who knows?

8511
08:55:48,160 --> 08:55:51,820
Oh My god, fucking of course you're here get out of here

8512
08:55:54,940 --> 08:56:03,080

Where is he?

8515
08:56:09,770 --> 08:56:11,230
Oh Where's the rat?

8516
08:56:13,190 --> 08:56:14,710
Where is he?

8517
08:56:15,030 --> 08:56:16,450
Oh my god, where is he?

8518
08:56:16,630 --> 08:56:28,230

8521
08:56:50,220 --> 08:56:51,640
Oh, fucking strong.

8522
08:56:51,900 --> 08:56:54,500
Okay, my build is not strong against the rats.

8523
08:56:54,640 --> 08:56:55,820
I know that for sure.

8524
08:56:57,880 --> 08:57:00,500
My build is really weak against this cat.

8525
08:57:05,670 --> 08:57:06,750
Okay, there we go.

8526
08:57:08,770 --> 08:57:09,630
Holy shit.

8527
08:57:10,150 --> 08:57:12,530
I hate, I hate fighting him so much.

8528
08:57:12,630 --> 08:57:12,890
Are you?

8529
08:57:13,930 --> 08:57:18,130
You might understand you gave a certain tightener right for
a walloping of let.

8530
08:57:18,870 --> 08:57:20,670
May have I helped in my own way?

8531
08:57:21,410 --> 08:57:23,050
Not like you took down Kronos with your baby.

8532
08:57:23,310 --> 08:57:24,570
That's fucking sad.

8533
08:57:28,630 --> 08:57:32,170
Alright, your task can cause a blast that deals.

8534
08:57:33,110 --> 08:57:33,990
That's good.

8535
08:57:39,580 --> 08:57:40,920
Okay, yeah, you need that.

8536
08:57:44,580 --> 08:57:46,060
It's hard to be a rodent.

8537
08:57:46,320 --> 08:57:47,920
Alright, down we go.

8538
08:57:51,300 --> 08:57:52,280
Oh no, there's another coroner.

8539
08:57:52,500 --> 08:57:53,360
Oh my god.

8540
08:57:54,600 --> 08:57:55,600

Where's the monster I'm supposed to fight?

8547
08:58:39,680 --> 08:58:41,160
Look, I got confused, okay?

8548
08:58:41,600 --> 08:58:45,000
I got confused of this.

8549
08:58:48,900 --> 08:58:49,740
The end of the path.

8550
08:58:51,080 --> 08:58:52,680
All right, down I'll go.

8551
08:58:56,340 --> 08:58:57,620
By the will of chaos.

8552
08:58:57,680 --> 08:58:58,340
We're speed running.

8553
08:58:58,460 --> 08:58:59,240
We're speed running.

8554
08:58:59,720 --> 08:59:01,020
Oh, she stopped talking to me.

8555
08:59:01,180 --> 08:59:01,600
That's fine.

8556
08:59:07,100 --> 08:59:08,220
120 seconds.

8557
08:59:09,420 --> 08:59:10,760
I swear to God.

8558
08:59:11,940 --> 08:59:12,880
Oh, my God.

8559
08:59:13,100 --> 08:59:13,760
It's gone.

8560
08:59:19,970 --> 08:59:20,790
Oh, wait.

8561
08:59:20,910 --> 08:59:21,650
No, I'm going with...

8562
08:59:21,650 --> 08:59:22,030
I'm not...

8563
08:59:22,030 --> 08:59:23,390
Guys, I cannot do this.

8564
08:59:23,850 --> 08:59:26,530
I think the next two rooms are boss rooms, guys.

8565
08:59:26,770 --> 08:59:27,550
I think...

8566
08:59:28,610 --> 08:59:33,330
Guys, the next two rooms, I'm pretty sure are boss rooms.

8567
08:59:34,510 --> 08:59:48,610
There's no way I am not defeating the boss room in 120
seconds It would be funny

8568
08:59:53,280 --> 08:59:56,900
No, we need the mana We need

8569
09:00:03,990 --> 09:00:24,330
I swear to God I swear I swear to God I swear to God I don't
believe I don't believe I know I don't I don't believe I

8570
09:00:24,330 --> 09:00:37,130

8578
09:02:13,250 --> 09:02:22,490
I actually I forgot about it I picked it and I forgot about
it.

8579
09:02:23,090 --> 09:02:26,390
Literally, that was the only thing that was damaging me.

8580
09:02:26,410 --> 09:02:28,270
That's the worst part.

8581
09:02:30,210 --> 09:02:32,150
I was so confused.

8582
09:02:32,610 --> 09:02:34,750
I was like, what the fuck is hitting me?

8583
09:02:34,870 --> 09:02:35,650
I don't understand.

8584
09:02:36,970 --> 09:02:38,510
What could it be?

8585
09:02:40,810 --> 09:02:42,650
Oh, I'm not okay anymore.

8586
09:02:43,190 --> 09:02:44,030
Oh, it's okay.

8587
09:02:44,450 --> 09:02:45,930
Deaths of Fines, guys.

8588
09:02:50,140 --> 09:02:51,240
Okay, there you go.

8589
09:02:51,920 --> 09:02:52,600
She's down.

8590
09:02:59,270 --> 09:03:00,630
Oh my god.

8591
09:03:02,510 --> 09:03:03,410
This is bad.

8592
09:03:03,690 --> 09:03:04,750
This is actually so bad.

8593
09:03:05,550 --> 09:03:06,930
I wish I had cast.

8594
09:03:07,750 --> 09:03:10,110
Because cast would actually be so good right now.

8595
09:03:14,310 --> 09:03:15,090
There we go.

8596
09:03:15,290 --> 09:03:18,890
We don't need moon water.

8597
09:03:21,090 --> 09:03:22,470
A bit too close.

8598
09:03:22,950 --> 09:03:24,250
Oh yeah, no, that was a bit too close.

8599
09:03:24,390 --> 09:03:24,910
But we don't even know.

8600
09:03:24,910 --> 09:03:26,450
I don't even have moon water, guys.

8601
09:03:26,510 --> 09:03:27,350
It says zero.

8602
09:03:33,030 --> 09:03:35,250
It said zero, guys.

8603
09:03:35,430 --> 09:03:38,790
I couldn't even use moon water if I wanted to.

8604
09:03:41,290 --> 09:03:42,490
Okay, how much HP do I have?

8605
09:03:42,630 --> 09:03:43,510
I might as well go.

8606
09:03:47,470 --> 09:03:49,030
Yeah, let's grab the HP.

8607
09:03:49,950 --> 09:03:50,790
What do I have?

8608
09:03:54,110 --> 09:03:56,670
Grab that for the next boss fight.

8609
09:03:57,710 --> 09:03:58,550
Long way down.

8610
09:03:59,290 --> 09:04:00,950
That was under two minutes.

8611
09:04:00,970 --> 09:04:02,670
minutes without cast.

8612
09:04:03,110 --> 09:04:06,290
I'm still not... I was not fucking risking it.

8613
09:04:07,490 --> 09:04:09,550
How much more do I have for...

8614
09:04:09,550 --> 09:04:11,970
Oh my god.

8615
09:04:12,090 --> 09:04:14,230
I gotta find the goddamn entrance.

8616
09:04:15,870 --> 09:04:16,550
Oh my god.

8617
09:04:16,650 --> 09:04:17,770
I still forgot about that guy.

8618
09:04:20,270 --> 09:04:21,190
Fuck it.

8619
09:04:22,870 --> 09:04:25,050
Wait guys, how many more do I need?

8620
09:04:25,190 --> 09:04:26,790
How many rooms was the casting?

8621
09:04:27,570 --> 09:04:28,990
Oh my god, almost the cast.

8622
09:04:29,510 --> 09:04:30,750
I can't...

8623
09:04:38,180 --> 09:04:39,240
Oh wait, I'll grab this.

8624
09:04:42,540 --> 09:04:44,220
Oh my god, he wasn't even prior to this.

8625
09:04:46,480 --> 09:04:47,380
Four more rooms?

8626
09:04:47,920 --> 09:04:49,820
Okay, I just gotta remember.

8627
09:04:54,390 --> 09:04:56,870
God, not being able to do cast is so fucking...

8628
09:04:57,850 --> 09:04:59,070
Oh, it's so frustrating.

8629
09:04:59,750 --> 09:05:01,330
I'm so used to using it.

8630
09:05:02,710 --> 09:05:03,170
Damn it.

8631
09:05:04,250 --> 09:05:06,010
Oh my god, he does so much.

Oh, I didn't even see the second option.

8646
09:06:36,510 --> 09:06:37,530
I'll never know.

8647
09:06:38,670 --> 09:06:40,970
I'll never know what was over there.

8648
09:06:43,450 --> 09:06:44,730
I'm so sad.

8649
09:06:45,390 --> 09:06:47,570
I just auto- I was like, that's one tree!

8650
09:06:53,130 --> 09:06:54,290
Yeah, nice.

8651
09:06:55,390 --> 09:06:57,910
Look, I thought I saw one tree, okay?

8652
09:07:02,010 --> 09:07:03,050
Okay, nice.

8653
09:07:05,550 --> 09:07:07,290
No, this build is actually crazy.

8654
09:07:08,050 --> 09:07:10,170
Like, it's just so much DPS in general.

8655
09:07:12,270 --> 09:07:15,910
Is anyone ever- okay, it's how I gain magic anymore?

8656
09:07:16,430 --> 09:07:17,350
As expected.

8657
09:07:17,530 --> 09:07:23,450
Okay, your cast inflicts your attack a chance to hit two
times.

8658
09:07:24,110 --> 09:07:24,690
No deal.

8659
09:07:25,110 --> 09:07:26,810
You deal more damage than you take damage.

8660
09:07:27,730 --> 09:07:31,930
You take no more for 15 seconds.

8661
09:07:32,290 --> 09:07:32,910
Regain this.

8662
09:07:33,890 --> 09:07:34,750
Oh, wait.

8663
09:07:37,390 --> 09:07:37,990
You cast.

8664
09:07:39,470 --> 09:07:41,090
I think it's chance to hit two times.

8665
09:07:41,490 --> 09:07:42,350
Yeah, we do Gamba.

8666
09:07:43,010 --> 09:07:44,110
Gamba's always good.

8667
09:07:47,730 --> 09:07:48,310
Nice.

8668
09:07:50,570 --> 09:07:52,390

anyway I can't.

8675
09:08:55,630 --> 09:08:56,530
Oh my god.

8676
09:08:56,970 --> 09:08:57,390
I...

8677
09:08:58,510 --> 09:08:59,270
No.

8678
09:09:02,890 --> 09:09:03,650
Okay.

8679
09:09:04,270 --> 09:09:04,950
Okay, it's fine.

8680
09:09:06,370 --> 09:09:07,450
It was okay.

8681
09:09:10,370 --> 09:09:11,130
Hello.

8682
09:09:12,830 --> 09:09:15,010
It's Echo, Echo, Echo.

8683
09:09:15,690 --> 09:09:17,830
Aww, I'm fucking with her now.

8684
09:09:18,110 --> 09:09:20,150
You're not speaking in the customary way of mountain nymphs.

8685
09:09:20,410 --> 09:09:21,150
Some sort of curse.

8686
09:09:22,370 --> 09:09:23,550
Some sort of curse.

8687
09:09:23,830 --> 09:09:24,630
Sort of curse.

8688
09:09:26,290 --> 09:09:26,850
All right.

8689
09:09:28,750 --> 09:09:29,250
Oh, okay.

8690
09:09:29,490 --> 09:09:30,630
Fuck me, I guess.

8691
09:09:30,730 --> 09:09:32,190
You gave me the worst ones.

8692
09:09:35,510 --> 09:09:36,870
Gain no extra.

8693
09:09:37,130 --> 09:09:38,450
Gain another at...

8694
09:09:38,450 --> 09:09:39,290
Ah, fuck it.

8695
09:09:39,650 --> 09:09:41,010
Just give me a random boon.

8696
09:09:41,650 --> 09:09:43,310
I'll go with this.

8697
09:09:48,060 --> 09:09:48,940
Oh, wait.

8698
09:09:49,040 --> 09:09:49,840
No, that's good.

8699
09:09:50,860 --> 09:09:51,280
Cardio.

8700
09:09:52,980 --> 09:09:53,700
Wait, one.

8701
09:09:54,040 --> 09:09:54,380
Yeah.

8702
09:09:54,720 --> 09:09:55,120
Magic.

8703
09:09:55,320 --> 09:09:55,760
Let's go.

8704
09:09:57,520 --> 09:09:58,120
Okay.

8705
09:09:58,140 --> 09:09:59,960
All in on magic.

8706
09:10:01,480 --> 09:10:03,320
Aphrodite, moon, and boon.

8707
09:10:03,640 --> 09:10:04,240
Alright, there you go.

8708
09:10:05,280 --> 09:10:06,620
Aphrodite, moon, and boon.

8709
09:10:11,400 --> 09:10:12,180
Okay, moon.

8710
09:10:13,140 --> 09:10:14,340
Alright, I should be able to cast now.

8711
09:10:15,320 --> 09:10:16,520
Yeah, there you go.

8712
09:10:17,340 --> 09:10:17,940
Thank god.

8713
09:10:19,660 --> 09:10:21,580
Like, thank fucking god.

8714
09:10:22,300 --> 09:10:23,620
Like, I actually just needed this.

8715
09:10:25,120 --> 09:10:26,820
Oh my god, there's so many things.

8716
09:10:29,220 --> 09:10:29,760
Okay.

8717
09:10:32,520 --> 09:10:33,240
That's right!

8718
09:10:33,660 --> 09:10:34,800
I'll go so fast now!

8719
09:10:34,980 --> 09:10:36,520
So much DPS now!

8720
09:10:38,240 --> 09:10:39,020
Alright, moon.

8721
09:10:40,340 --> 09:10:41,060
Get here.

8722
09:10:43,660 --> 09:10:44,900
I almost there at the purple.

8723
09:10:45,020 --> 09:10:46,560
I'm not even reading that shit.

8724
09:10:48,660 --> 09:10:49,800
God, where do I go?

8725
09:10:50,580 --> 09:10:51,460
That fragility.

8726
09:10:53,980 --> 09:10:54,900
Get him out of here.

8727
09:10:58,360 --> 09:10:59,660
Oh my god, there's so many wolves.

8728

I just want to dodge.

8733
09:11:35,860 --> 09:11:36,200
Fuck it.

8734
09:11:36,320 --> 09:11:36,760
One more.

8735
09:11:36,840 --> 09:11:38,020
Can't hit me.

8736
09:11:39,720 --> 09:11:40,240
Alright, dig.

8737
09:11:43,360 --> 09:11:44,840
Where the fuck are the others?

8738
09:11:45,740 --> 09:11:46,360
Alright, boon.

8739
09:11:49,120 --> 09:11:50,980
Alright, get rid of the snakes first.

8740
09:11:55,840 --> 09:11:56,180
Alright.

8741
09:11:56,460 --> 09:11:57,560
Can't do shit now.

8742
09:11:59,080 --> 09:12:00,520
Oh my god.

8743
09:12:00,660 --> 09:12:01,580
That's a lot of...

8744
09:12:01,580 --> 09:12:02,740
Okay, this is actually...

8745
09:12:02,760 --> 09:12:06,040
This is a really crazy build that accidentally did.

8746
09:12:08,460 --> 09:12:10,280
Your attacks can cause a...

8747
09:12:11,760 --> 09:12:13,340
Oh, I don't know.

8748
09:12:15,680 --> 09:12:17,100
One or two, chat.

8749
09:12:19,280 --> 09:12:19,720
One?

8750
09:12:20,960 --> 09:12:21,640
Yeah, one.

8751
09:12:22,700 --> 09:12:23,740
Where the fuck are you?

8752
09:12:23,740 --> 09:12:25,140
He's been waiting for so long.

8753
09:12:25,860 --> 09:12:27,600
This guy was waiting for me.

8754
09:12:28,920 --> 09:12:30,700
I was like, what the fuck?

8755
09:12:31,300 --> 09:12:32,020
A golden bow.

8756
09:12:33,020 --> 09:12:34,620
God, I need that.

8757
09:12:37,620 --> 09:12:38,760
Okay, nice.

8758
09:12:39,600 --> 09:12:41,940
Okay, the last one is down here.

8759
09:12:44,260 --> 09:12:45,900
Alright, we gotta go.

8760
09:12:46,700 --> 09:12:48,140
We gotta book it.

8761
09:12:50,500 --> 09:12:52,340
Boon shop money.

8762
09:12:53,220 --> 09:12:54,060
How much money do I have?

8763
09:12:54,360 --> 09:12:55,500
Okay, it's worth it.

8764
09:12:55,760 --> 09:12:56,160
300.

8765
09:12:57,800 --> 09:12:58,720
Oh hey, it's that.

8766
09:13:00,220 --> 09:13:00,740
Okay.

8767
09:13:02,760 --> 09:13:04,940
Beyond awaits the monstrous hound.

8768
09:13:05,000 --> 09:13:06,680
Okay, this is a city shot, but that's fine.

8769
09:13:06,900 --> 09:13:14,940
No longer watchful of the underworld's gates, but now grown
desperate to return to his grid master, wherever he resides.

8770
09:13:15,980 --> 09:13:16,800
Wait, this is fine.

8771
09:13:17,660 --> 09:13:19,440
Hear me on my authority.

8772
09:13:19,600 --> 09:13:20,640
Oh, all right.

8773
09:13:21,360 --> 09:13:24,100
Rushing your tax king power, but you prime 20.

8774
09:13:25,220 --> 09:13:28,220
Gain, and now for the rest of this night.

8775
09:13:28,660 --> 09:13:29,300
Fuck it.

8776
09:13:30,800 --> 09:13:31,660
Let's go.

8777
09:13:32,760 --> 09:13:34,640
Girl, I'm not buying the ash.

8778
09:13:34,780 --> 09:13:35,260
I don't care.

8779
09:13:36,380 --> 09:13:41,940
This is the run where I either die or like everything will
be fine.

8780
09:13:43,260 --> 09:13:43,880
This is the run.

8781
09:13:44,160 --> 09:13:45,460
I either make it or break it.

8782
09:13:50,880 --> 09:13:51,440
Okay.

8783
09:13:55,920 --> 09:13:56,220
Bye.

8784
09:13:57,020 --> 09:13:57,900
Oh, God.

8785
09:13:58,100 --> 09:13:59,460
Fucking of course that hits me.

8786
09:14:01,680 --> 09:14:02,320
Okay, it's fine.

8787
09:14:03,840 --> 09:14:04,400
I have heals.

8788
09:14:05,680 --> 09:14:06,980
Oh, yeah, fucking course.

8789
09:14:10,180 --> 09:14:12,200
Oh, and then he goes high like a pussy.

8790
09:14:17,220 --> 09:14:18,480
Okay, it's five.

8791
09:14:20,000 --> 09:14:20,960
We're so fast.

8792
09:14:22,740 --> 09:14:24,480
Our attacks are so goddamn fast.

8793
09:14:25,520 --> 09:14:26,080
We're unstoppable.

8794
09:14:30,120 --> 09:14:32,660
I just gotta make sure he doesn't fucking hit me there.

8795
09:14:33,380 --> 09:14:34,100
Where is he going?

8796
09:14:37,900 --> 09:14:38,380
Okay.

8797
09:14:39,260 --> 09:14:39,740
Okay.

8798
09:14:41,340 --> 09:14:43,620
Holy fuck, I do so much damage.

8799
09:14:43,800 --> 09:14:47,120
It's actually insane how much damage I'm doing to him.

8800
09:14:49,400 --> 09:14:55,840
Like, if I have the HEP thing for this, I think this would
have been, like, the craziest, the fastest fucking run ever.

8801
09:14:58,600 --> 09:14:59,840
Oh, fucking crazy.

8802
09:15:00,340 --> 09:15:01,720
Or, like, the fire thing.

8803
09:15:06,920 --> 09:15:11,560
I think if I had the fire blast from Hesia, I think that
would also be crazy.

8804
09:15:14,380 --> 09:15:20,640
I think the fire blast would actually go so far Where the
fuck did he go?

8805
09:15:26,070 --> 09:15:35,770
Jesus fire is fine Yeah No, I think it'd be like the fire
blast with my cast I think it'd be really strong with that

8806
09:15:35,770 --> 09:15:38,730
The hound of hell is ended for the while

8807
09:15:43,490 --> 09:15:49,210
Yay, be sued Now be at peace.

8808
09:15:49,290 --> 09:15:52,190
No, this literally build is so fucking fast.

8809
09:15:53,750 --> 09:15:54,210
This is it.

8810
09:15:55,330 --> 09:15:56,390
Okay, this is it.

8811
09:15:56,910 --> 09:15:59,610
Surely it won't take me 20 years to kill Kronos.

8812
09:16:00,370 --> 09:16:00,930
Surely, right?

8813
09:16:01,670 --> 09:16:02,890
Alright, let's grab the teeth.

8814
09:16:04,530 --> 09:16:05,210
In water.

8815
09:16:07,190 --> 09:16:09,350
It costs zero dollar center.

8816
09:16:11,430 --> 09:16:12,330
I don't know.

8817
09:16:12,590 --> 09:16:13,930
I don't know if I'm willing.

8818
09:16:14,050 --> 09:16:15,570
I don't know about chaos.

8819
09:16:15,650 --> 09:16:16,370
You have to fuck it.

8820
09:16:16,570 --> 09:16:17,070
Let's go.

8821
09:16:18,710 --> 09:16:19,430
Let's go.

8822
09:16:20,670 --> 09:16:22,850
What will chaos give me this time?

8823
09:16:23,430 --> 09:16:24,490
The lowest reaches.

8824
09:16:34,190 --> 09:16:34,650
It worked.

8825
09:16:34,930 --> 09:16:35,270
All right.

8826
09:16:38,010 --> 09:16:39,430
What will chaos give me?

8827
09:16:39,630 --> 09:16:42,510
We bid you a warm welcome to the depths of Tatras.

8828
09:16:43,390 --> 09:16:44,430
That was awkward.

8829
09:16:46,650 --> 09:16:49,210
I forgot about the trap, guys.

8830
09:16:49,690 --> 09:16:49,910
All right.

8831
09:16:51,430 --> 09:16:53,090
I forgot about it again.

8832
09:17:01,190 --> 09:17:03,230
There's so many things on my screen, okay?

8833
09:17:03,410 --> 09:17:04,110
It's not my fault.

8834
09:17:04,510 --> 09:17:06,610
There's so many things on my screen.

8835
09:17:12,230 --> 09:17:14,310
I forgot about it, okay?

8836
09:17:15,690 --> 09:17:17,910
Guys, it's been nine hours.

8837
09:17:19,670 --> 09:17:21,370
Oh, yeah, I'm fine with not earning money.

8838
09:17:21,890 --> 09:17:22,790
Wait, I'd like that.

8839
09:17:23,090 --> 09:17:24,030
Wait, actually, fuck.

8840
09:17:24,050 --> 09:17:35,330
that yeah no who needs money all right hey dad such a
cacophony occurred after you last visited exactly when i

8841
09:17:35,330 --> 09:17:47,330
cannot say all of the titans wretched servants flew into a
panic their cries would not cease what transpired perhaps

8842
09:17:47,330 --> 09:17:54,990
they were concerned for their master all busy trying to
bring him back to life because I slew him finally I did it

8843
09:17:54,990 --> 09:18:05,410
and it won't be the last time I killed him once it's fine
yeah I could have had four death defiance which once took

8844
09:18:05,410 --> 09:18:13,470
half the blasted strength of Olympus all on you not on my
own at all I had their strength if not their support as

8845
09:18:13,470 --> 09:18:18,530
you've given me yours father we can stop him Yeah, we can do
it, Dad.

8846
09:18:18,830 --> 09:18:19,630
We can kill him.

8847
09:18:20,630 --> 09:18:21,470
That would be so easy.

8848
09:18:21,490 --> 09:18:23,770
He shall seek vengeance with a renewed zeal.

8849
09:18:24,950 --> 09:18:27,690
This entire plot of his is driven by the same imbrose.

8850
09:18:28,790 --> 09:18:30,070
Then kill him if you must.

8851
09:18:30,970 --> 09:18:33,230
At least his many deaths.

8852
09:18:33,470 --> 09:18:34,670
Nine more times.

8853
09:18:35,350 --> 09:18:37,010
Nine more times.

8854
09:18:39,030 --> 09:18:39,430
Yeah.

8855
09:18:41,350 --> 09:18:42,650
Okay, here you go.

8856
09:18:45,570 --> 09:18:46,110
150.

8857
09:18:51,260 --> 09:18:53,880
Ah, one, three, one, or three.

8858
09:18:56,800 --> 09:18:57,720
Three, right?

8859
09:18:59,660 --> 09:19:02,120
But then the dash has been really helpful, too.

8860
09:19:04,840 --> 09:19:06,920
I'll do three, just so I don't have to deal with.

8861
09:19:08,660 --> 09:19:10,100
Yeah, I'll do three for that.

8862
09:19:10,260 --> 09:19:11,660
Yeah, fuck the eyeglasses.

8863
09:19:11,880 --> 09:19:12,460
No, you're right.

8864
09:19:13,780 --> 09:19:14,260
You're right.

8865
09:19:14,980 --> 09:19:15,940
Okay, take care of him, okay?

8866
09:19:16,900 --> 09:19:18,120
Okay, fuck you.

8867
09:19:19,540 --> 09:19:21,140
I'm like, servers, take care of him.

8868
09:19:21,200 --> 09:19:22,040
He's like, no!

8869
09:19:26,580 --> 09:19:28,540
Oh my god, I gotta make sure I don't fucking...

8870
09:19:30,260 --> 09:19:32,620

8871
09:19:34,800 --> 09:19:35,660
Oh my god.

8872
09:19:35,760 --> 09:19:37,640
I really want the...

8873
09:19:37,640 --> 09:19:40,400
The one where I could chuck my thing.

8874
09:19:41,120 --> 09:19:42,380
Because I think that would be...

8875
09:19:42,380 --> 09:19:44,260
That would make the build so strong.

8876
09:19:44,300 --> 09:19:45,440
If I could just chuck it.

8877
09:19:50,260 --> 09:19:50,680
Okay.

8878
09:19:51,000 --> 09:19:51,480
There you go.

8879
09:19:53,200 --> 09:19:55,620
Do I risk straying from the shortest route?

8880
09:19:59,800 --> 09:20:00,480
Yes!

8881
09:20:00,920 --> 09:20:01,460
Oh, great.

8882
09:20:01,920 --> 09:20:02,260
Oh, no.

8883
09:20:02,620 --> 09:20:03,220
Oh, no.

8884
09:20:03,460 --> 09:20:04,720
Wait, maybe not.

8885
09:20:05,600 --> 09:20:07,300
Wait, wait a minute.

8887
09:20:15,700 --> 09:20:17,540
Now I'm not too sure anymore.

8888
09:20:18,420 --> 09:20:18,760
Now...

8889
09:20:22,720 --> 09:20:23,980
Okay, that's fine.

8890
09:20:24,920 --> 09:20:25,500

It would have been so good.

8909
09:21:51,170 --> 09:21:54,770
If this had a freeze, this actually would have been so OP.

8910

Oh no, I don't have heals anymore.

09:23:40,470 --> 09:23:41,370
This is so bad.

8929
09:23:44,310 --> 09:23:45,510
This is actually so bad.

8930
09:23:48,370 --> 09:23:49,570

Okay, that's fine.

Poppy flower seeds.

8937
09:24:15,000 --> 09:24:16,340
Was that all the room?

8938
09:24:16,420 --> 09:24:17,420
Okay, this is the last room.

8939
09:24:17,540 --> 09:24:19,160
I only have one heal left, too.

09:24:19,660 --> 09:24:21,420
Oh, please tell me.

8941
09:24:24,320 --> 09:24:26,820

Are you fucking kidding me?

8943
09:24:28,460 --> 09:24:33,500
Yeah, that's the only bad thing about this is that it's so
overwhelming.

8944
09:24:34,020 --> 09:24:37,260
Yeah, it's so overwhelming when you don't have...

8945

09:24:41,480 --> 09:24:42,460
It's really bad.

8947
09:24:44,540 --> 09:24:46,180
When there's no CCs for this.

8948
09:24:50,520 --> 09:24:51,240
Okay, that's fine.

09:25:53,250 --> 09:25:53,790
Jesus.

8984
09:27:20,940 --> 09:27:24,280
You have a million depth defiance.

8985
09:27:31,670 --> 09:27:34,610
Is this really better than my current one?

8986
09:27:34,730 --> 09:27:36,550
My current one is volcanic.

8987
09:27:44,690 --> 09:27:46,490
Okay, one is good.

8988
09:27:46,870 --> 09:27:46,890

09:27:57,850 --> 09:27:58,710
Okay, yeah, we don't need that.

8994
09:27:58,730 --> 09:27:59,910
We're not doing that.

Oh, wait, electric overload.

8996
09:28:07,250 --> 09:28:07,550

09:28:07,750 --> 09:28:08,090
Two?

8998
09:28:10,970 --> 09:28:13,450
I am not doing another exchange!

8999
09:28:16,070 --> 09:28:19,750
I am not doing another exchange!

9000
09:28:24,250 --> 09:28:25,810
I'm not doing it.

9001
09:28:32,130 --> 09:28:33,650
Here we go.

9002
09:28:35,970 --> 09:28:38,010
I don't even know how many depth defiances I have.

9003
09:28:38,110 --> 09:28:39,050
I think I have three, right?

9004
09:28:42,800 --> 09:28:43,700
I've had...

9005
09:28:43,700 --> 09:28:44,720
I have three now.

9006
09:28:46,180 --> 09:28:46,660
Cowards.

9007
09:28:49,200 --> 09:28:50,920
Your eyes do not deceive.

9008
09:28:51,600 --> 09:28:54,040
I'm as hailed and hearty as can be.

9009
09:28:57,260 --> 09:28:59,960
I'm doing my nine to five right now in Hades.

9010
09:29:01,260 --> 09:29:03,120
I told you guys, I love roguelikes.

9011
09:29:04,360 --> 09:29:06,520
You now know it to be true.

9012
09:29:07,880 --> 09:29:10,280
I was never going to destroy you in a single clash.

9013
09:29:11,140 --> 09:29:14,520
You more than anybody ought to know results of any worth
take time.

9014
09:29:17,040 --> 09:29:20,480
I wish I had the chucking cast though.

9015
09:29:21,840 --> 09:29:23,580
That one was so strong.

9016
09:29:25,340 --> 09:29:39,080
the end fine for my part I occasionally need to stretch my
limbs all right here we go again here we go again I

9017
09:29:42,850 --> 09:29:50,350
gotta get rid of him first too Jesus Christ at least I can
okay

9018
09:29:55,940 --> 09:29:59,860
oh my god I didn't even realize that was a thing

9019
09:30:04,700 --> 09:30:06,360
We were fucking minions out first.

9020
09:30:07,160 --> 09:30:07,540
There we go.

9021
09:30:09,820 --> 09:30:10,340
Goodbye.

9022
09:30:16,520 --> 09:30:17,200
Oh my god.

9023
09:30:17,360 --> 09:30:18,020
Okay, I didn't see that.

9024
09:30:21,550 --> 09:30:22,890
It's so annoying, though.

9025
09:30:22,990 --> 09:30:23,650
If I had...

9026
09:30:24,170 --> 09:30:26,470
I wish I had the...

9027
09:30:26,470 --> 09:30:27,930
The cast.

9028
09:30:28,130 --> 09:30:29,830
I think it would be so strong.

9029
09:30:33,470 --> 09:30:34,370
Where is he?

9030
09:30:35,850 --> 09:30:37,370
Are you fucking kidding me?

9031
09:30:37,430 --> 09:30:37,610
Okay.

9032
09:30:38,370 --> 09:30:38,890
Okay.

9033
09:30:48,080 --> 09:30:49,540
Oh my god.

9034
09:30:50,220 --> 09:30:51,360
God, fuck you!

9035
09:30:57,300 --> 09:30:59,300
Oh my god, I hate your minions!

9036
09:31:02,160 --> 09:31:03,560
There you go.

9037
09:31:07,080 --> 09:31:07,840
There

9038
09:31:11,220 --> 09:31:11,980
you go.

9039
09:31:12,140 --> 09:31:12,540
Oh my god.

9040
09:31:21,470 --> 09:31:21,870
There you go.

9041
09:31:23,050 --> 09:31:23,270
Oh!

9042
09:31:24,190 --> 09:31:27,010
Seven, you possess some of your father's strength.

9043
09:31:27,950 --> 09:31:29,350
Or rather, mine.

9044
09:31:34,290 --> 09:31:54,820
clutch oh this one is hard though like see i can't do that i
think if i could i wish i could do that like the what was it

9045
09:31:54,820 --> 09:32:09,360

Okay.

Are you serious?

9050
09:33:00,380 --> 09:33:01,300
Take this!

9051
09:33:01,700 --> 09:33:02,840
Oh my god!

9052
09:33:05,560 --> 09:33:08,700
I can't believe that was the run!

9053
09:33:09,480 --> 09:33:13,160
I was like, bro, I'm just gonna go in there, get 12 rooms,
and then be over.

9054
09:33:13,520 --> 09:33:17,040
I- We're still 11 minutes to spare.

9055
09:33:18,740 --> 09:33:20,100
Oh my god.

9056
09:33:20,600 --> 09:33:22,300
Bro, I had three death defiances.

9057
09:33:22,500 --> 09:33:23,040
I was rich.

9058
09:33:23,100 --> 09:33:24,780
I still had two more.

9059
09:33:25,320 --> 09:33:27,680
I saw I was gonna just take it.

9060
09:33:27,800 --> 09:33:31,060
I knew I had a lot of oh my god.

9061
09:33:31,260 --> 09:33:41,900
I can't I was not trying to do another run Look at that Ares
The gutted grand hall of the former house of Hades eerily

9062
09:33:41,900 --> 09:33:50,460
lies still 12 minutes is quick in and out adventure The dark
princess pursues an object that may be the key to her

9063
09:33:50,460 --> 09:33:59,600
predicament I don't remember this princess chamber still
he's gone for now all right back to laura the chambers down

9064
09:33:59,600 --> 09:34:07,500
the hall laura again just as it was the chambers of the
missing underworld prince lie in a perpetual state the

9065
09:34:07,500 --> 09:34:17,620
moment she left it got so easy of time but otherwise
untouched for who would dare just as we surmise that was so

9066
09:34:17,620 --> 09:34:28,560
much damage that was crazy of the subconscious i descend
that's actually crazy that was So I don't even know how I

9067
09:34:28,560 --> 09:34:32,560
fucking got that much damage going in literally was
autopiling fixed.

9068
09:34:32,680 --> 09:34:34,940
I was like And I was like wait a minute.

9069
09:34:35,440 --> 09:34:43,800
That's a lot of damage I was like wait, wait

9070
09:34:49,520 --> 09:34:55,060
Hey, I'm back Just as I remember

9071
09:34:58,250 --> 09:35:03,170
everything just as you said particularly since you're here
again so soon Where were we?

9072
09:35:04,850 --> 09:35:10,190
I was trying to persuade you to take me at my word that I'm
your sister from a future time in which the Titan Kronos has

9073
09:35:10,190 --> 09:35:17,550
usurped the house of Hades I mean to stop him okay I don't
have much time I don't need exposition dump him I have a

9074
09:35:17,550 --> 09:35:32,300
wide end the designated security specialist around here so
perhaps I know the answer to that one some security

9075
09:35:32,300 --> 09:35:38,360
specialist Kronos caught the house entirely off guard but
you're my closest kin you've subverted the will of the fates

9076
09:35:38,360 --> 09:35:43,700
before and slain gods if not Titans I also lack the means of
reaching anybody else this way.

9077
09:35:44,320 --> 09:35:45,940
Yeah, you're the only one I can talk to, brother.

9078
09:35:46,040 --> 09:35:47,820
I feel that strong kinship between us already.

9079
09:35:48,460 --> 09:35:48,960
Next question.

9080
09:35:49,760 --> 09:35:53,020
Where even is this Kronos, and what would you have me do if
and when I locate him?

9081
09:35:53,600 --> 09:35:55,260
Let's kill him, chop him.

9082
09:35:57,060 --> 09:36:00,720
I don't know where Kronos is exactly in your time, though I
do have a lead.

9083
09:36:01,140 --> 09:36:06,500
His remains were scattered to the deepest pits of Tartarus,
which means he's probably recovering below where you reside.

9084
09:36:07,120 --> 09:36:16,160
As for what to do if you can locate him, we'll get to that
um i hate to break it to you melina we but this isn't all

9085
09:36:16,160 --> 09:36:21,700
that comprehensive a plan especially for something you've
been planning all your life do i just wait for you to work

9086
09:36:21,700 --> 09:36:29,340
through the details or yeah this is a shitty plan like did i
not come prepared your security specialist begin an

9087
09:36:29,340 --> 09:36:37,920
investigation though in absolute secrecy what the is it like
you do all the work like do i not have a plan you betrayed

9088
09:36:37,920 --> 09:36:45,540
this for your whole life I was like, okay, now, brother, now
that I got here, it's your turn to figure this out.

9089
09:36:49,120 --> 09:36:50,300
What's left of them, yes.

9090
09:36:50,760 --> 09:36:53,840
I can only reach you like this while we're in the same
location across time.

9091
09:36:54,640 --> 09:36:58,320
My plan is literally was like, go find him and then have him
deal with the rest.

9092
09:37:01,900 --> 09:37:04,080
Yeah, I never thought I'd get this far, guys.

9093
09:37:05,420 --> 09:37:06,560
Then don't wait up on my account.

9094
09:37:07,160 --> 09:37:09,560
I'll see what I can do and speak to you and next to you on
my dreams.

9095
09:37:10,300 --> 09:37:19,340
care sister we'll sort this out all right nice you make it
sound so effortless all right eight more to go guys eight

9096
09:37:19,340 --> 09:37:28,240

9098
09:37:40,860 --> 09:37:41,380
where is he?

9099
09:37:49,240 --> 09:37:50,020
Oh, five more.

9100
09:37:50,200 --> 09:37:51,000
Thank God.

9101
09:37:52,940 --> 09:37:54,380
Thank fucking God.

9102
09:37:55,600 --> 09:37:56,560
Deft of Kronos.

9103
09:37:58,100 --> 09:37:59,120
Oh my God, there we go.

9104
09:38:01,820 --> 09:38:03,160
Finally did it.

9105
09:38:03,160 --> 09:38:04,720
My protection, I dispel.

9106
09:38:05,280 --> 09:38:08,060
For I am ready now for heaven as for hell.

9107
09:38:08,620 --> 09:38:11,100
We're not completing it all on today's stream, guys.

9108
09:38:11,440 --> 09:38:12,900
I just wanted to go up.

9109
09:38:13,940 --> 09:38:15,480
You brought the Titan low.

9110
09:38:16,360 --> 09:38:26,280
yeah back to back after that was your bygone brother more
cooperative I just wanted to see what's up he doesn't know

9111
09:38:26,280 --> 09:38:32,960
where to find Kronos though seems willing to investigate
perhaps he'll turn something up I still scarce believe it's

9112
09:38:32,960 --> 09:38:42,040
truly his past self I've spoken to imagine how he feels
continue to check up on him but not a word of this to

9113
09:38:42,040 --> 09:38:53,460
anybody else time flows ever forward And we are not meant to
travel opposite that stream All right, you did it.

9114
09:38:53,860 --> 09:38:54,820
Oh, hey new stuff.

9115
09:38:55,080 --> 09:39:00,820
Oh moon dust be well And then I can also get more psyche.

9116
09:39:01,220 --> 09:39:01,680
Yeah, fuck it.

9117
09:39:01,700 --> 09:39:02,600
Let's just get more psyche.

9118
09:39:02,660 --> 09:39:11,160
I think it's always just psyche How much do I have okay 845
all right What you said to me before about my mother?

9119
09:39:11,780 --> 09:39:21,200
Yeah, it's very cruel and yo mama me fair enough can't kill
each other here but we can use our words if we were fighting

9120
09:39:21,200 --> 09:39:31,840
for real I wouldn't have held back either I figured not all
right yep oh you want to talk okay give me a sec I need that

9121
09:39:31,840 --> 09:39:42,840
stuff plant poppy seed and wheat seed I have too much night
night shades anyway I heard your efforts to bring Cerberus

9122
09:39:42,840 --> 09:39:49,960
back to his senses was successful least temporarily goddess
he bounded off to Tartarus only to be cast out into the

9123
09:39:49,960 --> 09:39:58,700
fields again that's what I gathered yes I can't just bring
him back home yeah my father whom I happened upon bound in

9124
09:39:58,700 --> 09:40:08,760
chains Kronos is torturing them mocking them Kronos is using
them to get at you instilling you emotions that compel you

9125
09:40:08,760 --> 09:40:18,160
to throw caution to the wind remember wars are one and lost
in hearts and minds Did you not act on your emotions in your

9126
09:40:18,160 --> 09:40:18,800
mortal days?

9127
09:40:18,940 --> 09:40:20,480
Yeah, didn't your whole fucking crew died?

9128
09:40:21,680 --> 09:40:22,060
Oh, oh.

9129
09:40:22,660 --> 09:40:24,960
I guess he doesn't want to talk about it.

9130
09:40:25,220 --> 09:40:26,020
I mean, understandable.

9131
09:40:27,880 --> 09:40:29,700
Should be able to head to the surface now.

9132
09:40:29,700 --> 09:40:31,160
Oh my god, thank god, finally.

9133
09:40:32,580 --> 09:40:33,880
Thank fucking god.

9134
09:40:34,440 --> 09:40:35,800
I have enough.

9135
09:40:36,100 --> 09:40:36,500
150.

9136
09:40:36,620 --> 09:40:38,180
Oh, I can get psyche now.

9137
09:40:41,520 --> 09:40:43,520
Let's just grab some psyche real quick.

9138
09:40:43,620 --> 09:40:44,140
One, please.

9139
09:40:44,520 --> 09:40:45,280
How much do I need?

9140
09:40:45,500 --> 09:40:46,220
That's fine.

9141
09:40:50,640 --> 09:40:51,780
There we go.

9142
09:40:52,940 --> 09:40:53,580
Nice.

9143
09:40:55,500 --> 09:40:56,180
Oh, wait.

9144
09:40:58,640 --> 09:40:58,780
Oh.

9145
09:41:01,320 --> 09:41:03,740
Any minor fine for a major fine?

9146
09:41:05,940 --> 09:41:11,940
Their location rewards at least chance to deal critical
damage with death.

9147
09:41:12,200 --> 09:41:12,500
Fuck it.

9148
09:41:13,360 --> 09:41:14,700
I have enough of that.

9149
09:41:17,160 --> 09:41:18,260
Just in case.

9150
09:41:18,580 --> 09:41:19,100
Should work.

9151
09:41:22,080 --> 09:41:23,880
Alright, grab this out of here.

9152
09:41:24,060 --> 09:41:24,800
I will be done.

9153
09:41:24,840 --> 09:41:25,940
First be a little cautious here.

9154
09:41:27,360 --> 09:41:28,820
What was that?

9155
09:41:30,880 --> 09:41:32,580
I don't think I have...

9156
09:41:32,580 --> 09:41:33,480
Um...

9157
09:41:33,480 --> 09:41:34,360
Aspects yet.

9158
09:41:35,440 --> 09:41:36,820
Above the way to Olympus.

9159
09:41:37,380 --> 09:41:38,380
Oh hey, it's a full moon.

9160
09:41:38,500 --> 09:41:38,980
Let's go.

9161
09:41:39,560 --> 09:41:40,560
Alright, let's go!

9162
09:41:40,720 --> 09:41:41,200
Finally!

9163
09:41:41,920 --> 09:41:42,960
Olympus time!

9164
09:41:44,960 --> 09:41:46,280
What does that look like?

9165
09:41:48,440 --> 09:41:49,000
Hello.

9166
09:41:50,880 --> 09:41:52,440
Wait, what the fuck?

9167
09:41:54,200 --> 09:41:54,760
What?

9168
09:41:55,200 --> 09:41:57,160
What are you doing on the surface, young lady?

9169
09:41:57,620 --> 09:41:58,640
How shall you survive?

9170
09:41:59,220 --> 09:42:01,620
Surely you know your line is bound beneath the earth.

9171
09:42:02,100 --> 09:42:04,820
Your strength is better spent against our foes down there.

9172
09:42:05,540 --> 09:42:06,580
I can take them.

9173
09:42:06,720 --> 09:42:07,920
I beat up Kronos.

9174
09:42:12,570 --> 09:42:15,230
I don't fucking know bits, I guess.

9175
09:42:17,450 --> 09:42:18,370
Yeah, fuck it.

9176
09:42:19,010 --> 09:42:20,130
This is not the guys.

9177
09:42:20,510 --> 09:42:21,210
Oh, my God.

9178
09:42:21,490 --> 09:42:22,670
What is this?

9179
09:42:23,390 --> 09:42:23,790
Yeah.

9180
09:42:26,370 --> 09:42:27,550
What the fuck?

9181
09:42:28,270 --> 09:42:29,250
Where are these guys?

9182
09:42:30,770 --> 09:42:32,190
Rest again for now.

9183
09:42:32,870 --> 09:42:32,910
Oh.

9184
09:42:33,210 --> 09:42:33,450
What?

9185
09:42:34,650 --> 09:42:35,230
I...

9186
09:42:39,000 --> 09:42:40,660
Oh, my God!

9187
09:42:40,960 --> 09:42:45,940
The ill-fated princess feels her life force fade with every
breath of surface air.

9188
09:42:46,700 --> 09:42:49,840
Her soul recourse is to return whence she came.

9189
09:42:50,060 --> 09:42:50,640
Oh, no.

9190
09:42:50,820 --> 09:42:51,340
Oh, no.

9191
09:42:51,380 --> 09:42:52,300
I can't breathe.

9192
09:42:52,780 --> 09:42:54,320
Okay, we gotta do fast.

9193
09:42:55,220 --> 09:42:56,060
Oh, this is bad.

9194
09:42:57,020 --> 09:42:58,060
This is bad.

9195
09:42:59,920 --> 09:43:01,380
Oh, my God.

9196
09:43:03,640 --> 09:43:04,900
This is so bad for me.

9197
09:43:05,360 --> 09:43:07,320
Mining, mining, mining, though.

9198
09:43:09,220 --> 09:43:09,580
Oh, my God.

9199
09:43:09,740 --> 09:43:10,380
I can't breathe.

9200
09:43:11,000 --> 09:43:12,620
I can't breathe oxygen.

9201
09:43:13,060 --> 09:43:13,400
O2.

9202
09:43:13,580 --> 09:43:14,700
O2 is bad.

9203
09:43:17,800 --> 09:43:19,420
Quick, get the prize.

9204
09:43:19,740 --> 09:43:20,240
Didn't you, Sunshine?

9205
09:43:20,740 --> 09:43:22,660
I thought your birthright meant you couldn't live up here.

9206
09:43:23,240 --> 09:43:26,320
Oh, yeah, no, no, no, no, it's true.

9207
09:43:29,320 --> 09:43:31,760
I mean, I'm going to be taking damage all the time.

9208
09:43:33,800 --> 09:43:34,600
What's this?

9209
09:43:38,960 --> 09:43:41,460
Oh my god, what the fuck do I do?

9210
09:43:46,290 --> 09:43:47,610
What is this?

9211
09:43:48,370 --> 09:43:49,670
Oh, wait, but there's hammer, though.

9212
09:43:53,350 --> 09:43:54,990
Oh, this is so bad for me.

9213
09:43:55,010 --> 09:43:59,230
No, I'm dead

9214
09:44:02,330 --> 09:44:17,130
Pick a door Any door So Apparently Apparently she can't
breathe oxygen Oh too bad Well the fates decided long ago

9215
09:44:17,130 --> 09:44:21,810
That those of your line could not survive there And would
always be forced back to the underworld

9216
09:44:25,810 --> 09:44:32,870
palpable I never intended to stay for long just long enough
to lend my relative support but it's yeah that lasted like

9217
09:44:32,870 --> 09:44:42,210
two minutes well I don't see them around right now do you
incidentally there was once an incantation that I happened

9218
09:44:42,210 --> 09:44:49,180
upon which was not intended for my eyes but I now choose to
think that it was Oh, thank God.

9219
09:44:52,140 --> 09:44:52,700
Alright.

9220
09:44:56,280 --> 09:44:58,880
It literally was like a fish out of water.

9221
09:44:59,740 --> 09:45:01,980
Oh my god, yeah, I couldn't breathe yet.

9222
09:45:02,540 --> 09:45:06,220
It's literally like they chucked the fish onto land and it
was like, survive.

9223
09:45:06,660 --> 09:45:09,060
You must remember something of life on the surface, right
Dora?

9224
09:45:09,860 --> 09:45:10,680
Anything at all?

9225
09:45:11,500 --> 09:45:12,840
I wonder what it must have been like.

9226
09:45:13,900 --> 09:45:15,000
I don't remember.

9227
09:45:15,260 --> 09:45:16,440
And I don't wonder.

9228
09:45:17,780 --> 09:45:19,760
This is the life right here.

9229
09:45:22,860 --> 09:45:23,820
My greetings.

9230
09:45:24,380 --> 09:45:26,180
Thank you for visiting me last night, Lord Moros.

9231
09:45:27,400 --> 09:45:32,780
So, hypothetically, if I were to complete a certain
incantation that somehow loosened the grip the three fates

9232
09:45:32,780 --> 09:45:33,860
have on my birthright.

9233
09:45:34,100 --> 09:45:36,580
I mean, they're technically in prison, so they shouldn't
care.

9234
09:45:37,500 --> 09:45:42,380
Please understand, Princess, that I am not at liberty to
give advice on matters such as that, not even

9235
09:45:42,380 --> 09:45:43,060
hypothetically.

9236
09:45:43,660 --> 09:45:46,520
I trust I've been sufficiently direct in putting it this
way.

9237
09:45:47,340 --> 09:45:53,260
in other words we shouldn't be talking about this at all and
i assume all risk for my actions related to any potentially

9238
09:45:53,260 --> 09:46:00,380
forbidden incantations that i've learned damn it's like
legally speaking i can't do all this but hypothetically

9239
09:46:00,380 --> 09:46:11,240
maybe you could do this yeah that's a loop yes yeah the
loophole so they don't know oh no i won't succeed all right

9240
09:46:11,240 --> 09:46:14,960
so what can i do on the surface to survive.

9241
09:46:16,540 --> 09:46:17,580
Oh, remove the...

9242
09:46:18,420 --> 09:46:20,160
Oh, wait, no, it's not this.

9243
09:46:23,140 --> 09:46:23,620
Uh...

9244
09:46:24,220 --> 09:46:25,880
What would save me?

9245
09:46:26,800 --> 09:46:28,860
Do I even have anything that would save me?

9246
09:46:33,290 --> 09:46:34,430
I don't have anything.

9247
09:46:34,850 --> 09:46:36,430
Unraveling a faithful bond.

9248
09:46:36,630 --> 09:46:37,210
Oh, here it is.

9249
09:46:37,270 --> 09:46:37,990
Oh, it's up here.

9250
09:46:38,330 --> 09:46:39,770
Sorry, I was down here looking at it.

9251
09:46:39,810 --> 09:46:40,470
Oh, there you go.

9252
09:46:42,070 --> 09:46:44,130
What the fuck are all these?

9253
09:46:44,430 --> 09:46:59,740
The thalamus and moss the fuck is the fuck is that okay i
guess i gotta figure out how to get a thalamus like a

9254
09:46:59,740 --> 09:47:08,120
plumbus sounds like a goddamn plumbus the surface i can't
imagine that played out particularly well at least you made

9255
09:47:08,120 --> 09:47:16,460
it back at all i know the moss from the surface it was
draining even at night something about being under the stars

9256
09:47:16,460 --> 09:47:23,600
i it's chaos gate okay A lesson learned and an experience
gained.

9257
09:47:24,540 --> 09:47:26,760
The fates themselves do not want you up there.

9258
09:47:27,680 --> 09:47:28,600
What shall you do?

9259
09:47:30,780 --> 09:47:32,200
I have an incantation to complete.

9260
09:47:32,980 --> 09:47:34,680
I don't need to stay forever on the surface.

9261
09:47:35,460 --> 09:47:38,260
I just need to hold on long enough to make it to Olympus.

9262
09:47:38,420 --> 09:47:39,240
We're going to call it here.

9263
09:47:39,340 --> 09:47:40,180
I'm tired.

9264
09:47:43,300 --> 09:47:45,760
I went to, I tried to go to Olympus.

9265
09:47:45,880 --> 09:47:47,040
I got in two minutes.

9266
09:47:47,200 --> 09:47:48,200
That's enough for me.

9267
09:47:48,580 --> 09:47:50,040
That's enough touching grass for me.

9268
09:47:50,060 --> 09:48:03,600
me she and that we the same we touch grass for two minutes
and then we fucking died that was fun that was really fun um
