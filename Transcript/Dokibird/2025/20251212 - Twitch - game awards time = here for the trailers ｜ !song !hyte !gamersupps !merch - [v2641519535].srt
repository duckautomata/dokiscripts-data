Look, they said 430.

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,280
It's a pre-warm-up.

9
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,200
I, this is a live.

10
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,060
Okay, that is a live.

00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:23,840
What the fuck?

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,800
They said the main show is at 5.

13
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,540
So I was like, oh, it's 30 minutes.

14

I have enough time for this.

16
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,240
I could be a little bit late.

17
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,640
I didn't realize they're going straight into trailers right
off the bat.

18
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,260
Anyway, let me write that I'm here.

19
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,660

Um, so I hope I didn't fuck up my, my, my socket.

26
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,540

fuck that was so fast how did they get here so fast how it's

38
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,460

before we go straight into it.

39
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,900
But I guess not.

40
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,120
There's like no time to chill.

41
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,620
What the fuck is warm up then?

42
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,420
It was like 4.30 is the pre-show.

43
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,340
Like I'm like, then what the fuck does pre-show mean if it's
the actual show?

44
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,460
Like that's not pre-show.

45
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,900
Like you can't just put trailers in the pre-show.

46
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,850
Like what the fuck is the difference between pre-show?

47
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:09,770
like oh your trailers aren't aren't as good we're putting
you in the pre-show they don't they said five is the they

48
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:17,830
said five was the main show and the 430 is the pre-show so i
just assume it's just gonna be like people just talking and

49
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:24,150
like being like what do you think or like interview the red
or is there red carpet in the game awards i don't know but

50
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:31,230
you know what i mean like i'm like are these like is the
pre-show for the people who didn't pay a million dollars for

51
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:37,550
their fucking trailers to show sorry they paid 500 000 not
good enough

52
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:54,510
sorry they were only able to afford 500k instead of a
million dollars you're in the pre-show yeah yeah for those

53
00:03:54,510 --> 00:04:02,090
who don't know um so you just have to pay a million dollars
to be shown their trailer on to have the trailer shown it's

54
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:08,210
literally like the super bowl i keep saying this is people
were like don't don't support the game awards and i'm like

55
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:15,470

wins i'm just here for the trailer like the super bowl like

56

57
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,950
award show this is really the super bowl for gamers

58
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,440

bowl ad like

00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:49,860
it's at least cheaper than a super bowl ad guys yeah i like

I signed an NDA, but I'm going to risk it all just for you.

110
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,470
So, here's a hint about what's coming up.

111
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:25,210
Speaking of NDAs, there will be lots of new game
announcements.

112
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:32,390
The devs was like, the rival's devs messaged me and was
like, you should check out the game awards because we have a

113
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:40,390

00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:52,890

like girl i signed an nba with disney just wait

115
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:05,210
so i don't know so i don't know what is it But there's
apparently a special announcement for rivals.

116
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:13,850
Yeah, and they're not risking it for me I was like, oh, I
just want little in and she pulled out the Disney card And

117
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:28,450
the game award goes to game isn't that like CS two I'm also
who invited mobile legends bang bang?

118
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,070
Not wait not Faker?

119
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:34,750
Who are these people?

120
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:38,010
And the game award goes to?

121
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:39,390
Cho-V!

122
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,850
Yeah, where's Faker?

123
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:48,050
I'm surprised Faker didn't get in.

124
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:55,790
Yeah, but also I would thought League would have League
because of the finals.

125
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:59,630
Wasn't there more people watching the League finals though?

126
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,090
Team Fatality.

127
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,950
Which were...

128
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,850
What team was that?

129
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,310
Which game was that?

130
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:10,790
Around the world on more than 30 platforms.

131
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:14,350
Including for the first time on Prime Video.

132
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,250
Um...

133
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:20,810
Wasn't there more people watching the League Finals than
there were for CS?

134
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:25,550
That's why I thought like me Um, you would win it.

135
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,690
Also Mobile Legends Bang Bang.

136
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:30,970
Like what is that?

137
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:36,230
I know mobile gaming has a lot of fans, though.

138
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:38,170
Especially in Asia.

139
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,970
Oh, yeah, we saw this trailer.

140
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:45,800
Yeah,

141
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:51,430
I was going to say.

142
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:54,150
Mobile Bang Bang must have been really popular in Asia.

143
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,850
I've never heard of it, though.

144
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,030
But I know mobile gaming in general is popular in Asia.

145
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:04,930
Oh, Major League, Mobile League, Bang Bang.

146
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,410
Thank you for the Twitch Prime.

147
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:11,690
Thank you.

148
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:12,370
Thank you.

149
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,890
No, this is a...

150
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:17,430
We've seen trailers for this game for a while.

151
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,710
It's just like, yeah.

152
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,410
I think it's extraction.

153
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,390
Is it extraction shooter?

154
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:26,030
No, it's a single player.

155
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:27,850
I'm sorry.

156
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:31,930
Every game... I feel like everyone's just coming up with
extraction shooters now.

157
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:36,770
Every time I see a gun, I'm like, is that an extraction
shooter?

158
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:48,850
you're like it's like last year where every game was either
in space or post-apocalyptic now it's just like is this an

159
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:54,270
extraction shooter it's the new meta

160
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:14,750
coming later of the same beach in my research station back
home and surprise you can play a demo of pragmata on steam

161
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:21,730
right now see apparently do a thing where like we can add
ourselves to the the viewer account but like i don't know

162
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:27,810
how to do that i'm not good i don't think it really does

I don't discriminate games because they're on the pre-show
trailer.

183
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,900
I discriminate games because I saw a tactical adventure.

184
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,860
I saw the word tactical.

185
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,040

00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,310
Okay, I can up it more.

197
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:02,530
Oh,

198
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,430

204
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:04,670
so many incredible independent titles from i told you i told
you this was a free show

206
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:30,690

Claire Yeah, I was gonna say it has to be Claire That's

207
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:39,890
crazy that the Indie game, it doesn't consider Top Bill for
the main show That's crazy They put the best Indie game In

208
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:49,010

painting the walls Of the small office we had just rented We

209
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:53,750
wanted to make a small game then But with big and creative
independence.

210
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:59,690
It was challenging every day for most of our team present
here tonight.

211
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:04,490
Expedition 33 is the first game we've ever shipped.

212
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:07,070
That's crazy for the first game.

213
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:12,990
We couldn't be prouder of what this team has achieved and we
dedicate this award to all the indie teams around the world.

214
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:17,650
I like how he wore a beret to up the Frenchness.

215
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:19,790

Speaking of independent teams, this next game is a special
one.

00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,290
They're so French, bro.

224
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:43,790
A brand new independent studio.

225
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:50,870
It comes from Day for Night, a new studio from the lead
designer of Red Dead Redemption and the creative director.

226
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,130
Okay, that...

227
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:58,590
And then Mario slash rabbit.

228
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:01,610
Okay, what a game catalog.

229
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,190
Rabbits and Red Dead Redemption.

230
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:08,150
Okay, that's a crazy catalog.

231
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,830
Yeah, what the fuck do you mean?

232
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,130

Check.

236
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:21,390
Time for a new puck.

237
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:26,870
And that's a badger.

238
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:29,210
What the fuck?

239
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,450
What the fuck?

240
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:34,530
All I wanted was to go back home.

241
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,070
Badger boys.

242
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:38,930
Exploring.

243
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,130
Did some jumping around.

244
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:42,830
You know.

245
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:43,790
The classic.

246
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:44,450
Oh.

247
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:44,930

Oh, wait.

251

This is interesting.

252
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:53,910
Interesting

253
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:01,230
Guys, we're getting blood.

254
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:03,090
Is this bloodboard too?

255
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,290
What the fuck?

256
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:12,470
This is interesting cyber badger.

257
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:15,250
Oh, he's jumping through games.

258
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:23,730

That's interesting.

260
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,510
That's very meta.

261
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:31,370
I like this concept.

262
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:42,970
Docs?

263
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:50,390

Okay, that's...

268
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:18,470

279
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,940
Where's the gameplay?

280
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,040
I'm just watching a music video.

281
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,520
Games don't need games.

282
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,980
But this is the game.

283
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,900
This is just a very long cutscene.

284
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,880
Yeah, I'm gonna say is this a warm body?

285
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,320
Is that fucking zombie?

286
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,240
Romance movie?

287
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:02,160
All right,

288
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,960
I'll put a little bit more sound.

289
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,880
Yeah, let me know.

290
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,220
All right, this one.

291
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,180
I'll put it more.

292
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,340
But that's studio.

293
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,300
I can't even read this.

294
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,220
The title isn't even like the suit.

295
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,540
Stupid, okay, whatever.

296
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,480
Stupid never dies.

297
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:31,960
Okay.

298
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,200
I can't read it!

299
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,300
It's in different fonts!

300
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,020
Okay, there's the gameplay.

301
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,420
I don't know.

302
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,760
I will say...

303
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,520
I don't eat humans.

304
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:55,800
Oh, stupid.

305
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,380
Okay, stupid never dies.

306
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,840
At some point, I thought that's a toop.

307
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,940
Toop never dies.

308
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:08,560
I don't know, that doesn't, I don't know, it doesn't look
that fun.

309
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:16,360
Good music though, good music, but the gameplay looks very,
a bit boring.

310
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,340
It looks very boring.

311
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,840
Action games for action game fans.

312
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,640
Okay, we're minutes away from the main event.

313
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:27,380
We have one more award for you, a category that celebrates
other media.

314
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,220
I like the Badger one.

315
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,560
The Badger one is really interesting.

316
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,880
I like how it's like it's very meta.

317
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,640
Quarantine, Miki, they give a tier one something.

318
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:39,420
Thank you.

319
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,720
The fact that the Sonic movie isn't in here is a fucking
crime.

320
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,240
Like three of these movies, fucking soft.

321
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,640
Like until Dodd, really?

322
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,400

bad from what i've heard i heard double make was really bad

328

really bad and then like sonic wasn't even nominated but the

Is this volume okay now?

344
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:04,760
All right.

345
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,740
First real trailer.

346
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,620
I can't...

347
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:18,440
Yeah, I can't believe they finally announced Silk Song that
now we don't...

348
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,680
What do we have now?

349
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,100
What do we have to look forward to?

350
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,720
Not that they've announced Silk Song.

351
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,180
Oh, yeah, Blood Point.

352
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,780
Yeah, but then you guys are actually coping, though.

353
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,420
Sok song at least it felt a little real

354
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:51,440
Sok song actually felt real It was like it was like you know
it definitely could it could happen but the others you're

355
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,800
The others are just cool

356
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:07,500
Yeah, okay a bit more Is this clear Where's the flute guy?

357
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,300
guitar man.

358
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,780
What the fuck?

359
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,600
He said, Fluka, we got guitar, man.

360
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,640
I assume it's...

361
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,960
I assume they open with Claire.

362
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:33,380
Like I said, they're okay with Claire, but I know what
everyone says is really good.

363
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,380
I just knew it's just not my type of game genre.

364
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,440
And I know if I play it, people are gonna get really mad at
me.

365
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:44,700
I know what my game... Like, I know what games work with me
the best.

366
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:21,080
I will say None of them will ever top Alan Wake Alan Wake
too That was peak for me That was the most fever dream

367
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,260
Because I didn't play 2 yet So I was like What the fuck is
going?

368
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,440
We're not going back to...

369
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,060
I am not replaying Alan Wake 2, guys.

370
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:42,500
There's no way to salvage the save file either.

371
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,500
Oh my god, bro.

372
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,220
He's fucking ripping it.

373
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,200
You go, buddy.

374
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,280
Guys, I'm not replaying from the beginning, guys.

375
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,200
I'm not doing it going back from the beginning.

376
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,400
He's shredding it.

377
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,340
You know what?

378
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:12,080
Do you remember how fucking scary it is?

379
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:15,980
I do remember.

380
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,920
I remember being fucking scared.

381
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,920
Perfection is not attainable or affordable.

382
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:38,400
Excellent.

383
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,380
What the... Oh, okay.

384
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,200
It's part of the trailer.

385
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:43,060
I was like, are they giving me, like, quotes now?

386
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,880
Like, inspirational quotes?

387
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,200
I was like, wondering where this quote came from.

388
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,580
Sometimes we paint the bars of our own.

389
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,460
Are these Jeff quotes?

390
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:05,080
He chose a hard girl for yourself.

391
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:10,200
I guess these are all the games that came out in 2025.

392
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,780
Also, Donkey Kong looks so like out of place here.

393
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,340
What the fuck?

394
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,200
Also, here's a monkey.

395
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,520
What the fuck?

396
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,220
Everything is so serious.

397
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,920
By the way, he's a gorilla.

398
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,720
Oh, shit.

399
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,080
Oh, sash cap.

400
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,140
Oh, fuck.

401
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:34,520
Oh.

402
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,860
We can work with it.

403
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,100
Okay, this is bad.

404
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,040
I laughed a little too hard.

405
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:45,700
This is me.

406
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,560
Thank you for the five gifts.

407
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:48,320
It sucks.

408
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,220
What the fuck is Lego doing here?

409
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,620
You know me, headmistress.

410
00:32:53,940 --> 00:33:00,200
I know enough to get in the trouble.

411
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,200
Is this what my tomorrow will be?

412
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,260

413
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:15,280

428
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:44,710
nothing else, especially when life gets hard.

429
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:51,550
I don't usually open up about personal things on stage, but
2025 tested me in ways I didn't expect.

430
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,270
Me too, bro.

431
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:53,250
Me too.

432
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:54,790
I lost my tooth.

433
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:56,270
Oh, that's pretty bad, actually.

434
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:57,210
That's worse than me.

435
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:59,930
Oh, that's all right.

436
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:00,770

438
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:03,150

My mom's here tonight and we've left an empty seat beside

all of you became the source of strength for me i think

441
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:25,910
about this night this moment and this community and it gave
me something to look forward to it reminded me how important

442
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:34,470
it is to celebrate games games have this incredible ability
to hold us when we're hurting to lift us up when we feel

443
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:39,610
small to give us somewhere to go when the real world feels
unsteady.

444
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:42,230
I know I'm not alone in knowing that.

445
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:46,210
All of you watching tonight, you've felt that power too.

446
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:49,130
And that's why we're all connected in this moment.

447
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:49,870

450
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:59,750
I had an Overwatch name called Gamers Rise Up.

451
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:05,630
And then Blizzard made me change my name because they said
it's like a hate speech.

452
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:11,370
a record-setting three independent titles up for Game of the
Year.

453
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:15,310
This just gave me a free name change because they were like,
this is a hate speech.

454
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:17,190
I have to change my name.

455
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:22,050
We are going to have some fun, of course, too, with a whole
slate of brand new game announcements that will hopefully

action, and combat heavy.

00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,500
Here are the nominees for the best action game.

485
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:35,900

I tried.

494
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,220
I tried to figure it out.

495
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:08,740
And...

496
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:09,860
That is Hades, right?

497
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,360
It has to be Hades.

498
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:12,040
Yeah.

499
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,880

Congratulations, Amir, Greg, and the whole Super Giant team.

00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:22,240
That's amazing.

517
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:23,000
Oh, extreme.

518
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,220
All right.

519
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:27,520
Now we move into one of my favorite, and yes, sometimes very
dangerous parts of the evening.

520
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,020
Oh, extreme.

521
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:32,800
From the moment where we look ahead at what's coming next
from some of the world's most talented game creators.

522
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:38,620
There's speculation online about what may or may not appear
on that screen tonight.

523
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,360
And as always, my only advice is enjoy the journey.

524
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,160
Maybe you'll witness the birth of a brand new universe or
the long-awaited return of a legend.

525
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,260
That's the magic of this show.

526
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,760
Anything can happen.

527
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:53,600
So let's get started.

528
00:40:54,100 --> 00:41:02,520
It's time for our very first world premiere, something truly
special that we're honored to debut here at the Game Awards.

529
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:12,180
Finally a first world premiere Use the people what they want

530
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,660
Is this Blood Boy 2?

531
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:31,140
It's space I should have made a bingo Be like extraction
shooter My bingo card would be extraction shooter Space

532
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:35,080
zombies Post-apocalyptic Ha ha ha

533
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,780
Now, Battle Royale is old.

534
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,700
Battle Royale is now retro.

535
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,680
It's now extraction shooters, baby.

536
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,240
Is it Star Wars?

537
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:58,460
Yeah, I was gonna say, this looks like Star Wars.

538
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:08,870
It feels like Star Wars.

539
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:10,650
Because she's wearing a robe.

540
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:13,710
Or like a cape robe thing.

541
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,760
Yeah, I fucking knew it.

542
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,040
Oh, shit.

543
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:29,860
Oh, my God.

544
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:30,960
The Old Republic.

545
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:32,660
The

546
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:36,700
Old Republic.

547
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:44,540
Star Wars Fate of the Old Republic is a brand new single
player action role playing game set in the Old Republic era,

548
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:49,360
of course, and directed by Casey Hudson, who's joining us
here tonight.

549
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:53,260
Casey was, of course, the director on Star Wars Knights of
the Old Republic.

550
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,260
Oh!

551
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:00,280
That's a good trailer to start it off.

552
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:06,000
It's always the first game trailer, first world premiere,
and the last world premiere.

553
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:07,100
That's the most hype.

554
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,860
We have a very special guest I'd like to bring out.

555
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,160

Well, this is survival training.

575
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:28,150
Not survival talking.

576
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:31,130

It's Red Sek.

585
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:42,090
It's a lot of fun.

586
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:42,850
Dad, it's free.

587
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:43,790
Free Red Seks?

588
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:45,690
Do you think anyone here said sex?

589
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:46,570
He said sex.

590
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:47,670
You said free.

591
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:48,010
Oh.

592
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:49,170
The Redacted Sector.

593
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:49,590
Really?

594
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:50,170
Yeah.

595
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:51,570
Is that the name it is?

596
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:52,470
We gotta jump.

597
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:53,770
Am I supposed to have a big gun?

598
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:54,170
No.

599
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:57,290
You're gonna find big guns down there and we might even get
a tank noob.

600
00:45:57,370 --> 00:45:58,170
Oh, a tank.

601
00:45:58,270 --> 00:46:00,450
We're not getting a tank if we don't jump.

602
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:01,390
Oh, we need to jump.

603
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:01,850
Yes.

604
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:02,750
Go, go, go.

605
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:03,010
Go!

606
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:06,110
It's Red Seks.

607
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:06,590
It's Red Seks.

608
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:14,050
Oh I think the worst part is they paid a million dollars for
that.

609
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:18,510
I think I think that's oh

610
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:25,130
If I is it was it worth it?

611
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:27,290
Did you get the joke guys?

612
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:30,330
He said sex instead of sex guys

613
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:48,280
No, they spent all the budget on the on getting a slot
Getting an ad slot.

614
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:52,280
And there's like, okay, we have like $500 left.

615
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:53,980
We can't hurt us if they can't catch us.

616
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,060
We gotta get out of here.

617
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:56,000
Right now.

618
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,740
The zombie is redundant.

619
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:07,620
I prefer

620
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:13,030
you.

621
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:38,190
This is toxic.

622
00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:40,090
Carpenters.

623
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:48,110
Now it's time to put an end to gaming's most controversial
mystery.

624
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:49,190
Oh?

625
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:51,630
What?

626
00:47:56,890 --> 00:47:57,210
What?

627
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:01,890
Oh, is this about the statue?

628
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:04,830
Oh, yeah, the statue.

629
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:08,450
The fucking random statue in the field.

630
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:12,050
The Amish right here.

631
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:13,870
That's not the Amish.

632
00:48:17,370 --> 00:48:18,090
Oh, hey, too.

633
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:19,530
They're going to be flying.

634
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:21,690
Oh, goodbye, son.

635
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:24,110
You're going to hell.

636
00:48:30,330 --> 00:48:31,410
I guess you, too.

637
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:33,170
You committed some sin.

638
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:36,130
You guys held hands before marriage.

639
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:38,490
That's bad in the old times.

640
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:44,700
The rapture.

641
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:45,640
I don't think...

642
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,920
I think it's the opposite of the rapture.

643
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,420
What the fuck?

644
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:57,800
Oh, seizure warning.

645
00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:59,460
I did not like that.

646
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,280
Is this God of War?

647
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:23,180
Nah, this does not look Elden Ring-ish.

648
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:24,140
I don't know.

649
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:28,420
Is it witchy?

650
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:30,200
Do you think it's witchy?

651
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:36,440
That pre-rendered footage.

652
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:44,200
Yeah, I was gonna say this too happy to be Elden Ring.

653
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:50,630
Definitely something fantasy.

654
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:52,330
There's like elves and shit.

655
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:54,350
And dwarves.

656
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:00,140
This is...

657
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:01,000
Guys, this is Sims.

658
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,300
It could be Fable.

659
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:05,980
New IP?

660
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,340
The question is whether or not it's a new IP.

661
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:16,700
Divinity 3?

662
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,040
I don't know what Divinity 3...

663
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,300
Divinity series is.

664
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,140
I've heard of the name, but I don't really remember what
game it is.

669
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:20,170
You know sex, not sex.

670

Oh, oh.

671
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:32,100
Okay, guys, maybe burning him alive was not a good idea.

672
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:38,640
Yeah, they might have.

673
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:41,340
have fucked up with burning them alive.

674
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:50,450
Larian?

675
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:56,400
Oh, there's a statue.

676
00:51:58,680 --> 00:51:58,840
Divinity.

677
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,580
Oh, Divinity 3.

678
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,200
Oh, it's Baldur's Gate 3 devs.

679
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:11,020
So is it a new IP then?

680
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:12,340
Oh, it's Divinity.

681
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:12,800
Yeah.

682
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,180
I have no idea what this game is about, though.

683
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:30,220
What a that statue or monument that has fascinated the
internet now has a name the hellstone and yes larian winners

684
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:37,360
of game of the year in 2023 for bouldersgate 3 are hard at

next award two previous winners of best performance here at
the Game Awards, Maggie Robertson and Neil Nubon.

688
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:08,860
I would love to do predictions, but it just goes by so fast,
and I don't know the order of the nomination stuff.

689
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:12,860
I don't know what the order is.

690
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:16,360
It's just so fucking fast, too.

691
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:23,200
For the record, Neil said that he was wearing the dress this
year, so...

692
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:31,760
i can do game of the year prediction we'll just go straight
to game of the year that's at the end slash prediction they

693
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:42,840
just go too fast for me to do it they say acting is the art
of pretending all right start prediction what are the game

694
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:52,840
of the year guys what's the list you're someone else and
then winning awards for lying uh listen i've actually based

695
00:53:52,840 --> 00:54:01,520
my entire career on this we really need to have a you know
it's called comedy lock in e33 versus what donkey guys we

696
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:20,220
need to take e33 or donkey god all right who's the second
most likely donkey god okay i'll do silk song all right e33

697
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:27,580
or silk song and teenage girls forced to survive
extraordinary psychological and physical terror.

698
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:34,240
The point is acting is serious business and we are serious
actors here to talk about acting seriously.

699
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,860
Uh, thank you for the tier one sub.

700
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:38,560
Thank you.

701
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,020
Thank you.

702
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:41,620
Thank you for the gift of tier one gift of tier one sub.

703
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:42,180
Thank you.

704
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:44,980
Best performance.

705
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:48,380
I didn't make the rules between you two.

706
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:49,860
Ben Star.

707
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:51,560
We'll break the cycle.

708
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:52,980
Charlie Cox.

709
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:59,300
Apparently the Charlie Cox actor wondered it to be like his
body double to win it.

710
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:01,680
Or like the motion capture actor.

711
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:03,660
It's all clear.

712
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:05,520
It's crazy.

713
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:08,680
It's like Charlie or Ben, right?

714
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:12,440
I like how they gave Troy Baker a freebie.

715
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:16,520
And the game award goes to...

716
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,460
Is that Ben or Charlie?

717
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,380
Jennifer England!

718
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:22,000
Oh shit!

719
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:23,460
Jennifer?

720
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:26,520
She didn't expect that.

721
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:29,060
Oh.

722
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,660
Whoa, that's a surprise.

723
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:37,380
I didn't even know what she played.

724
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:40,600
I just knew about Ben or Charlie.

725
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:53,120
Should I go all in for E33?

726
00:55:57,340 --> 00:55:59,140
Oh, she played like the girl.

727
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,100
Oh, yeah, the Potentail Girl.

728
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:05,740
I don't even know about it because I saw art of it from
Hades.

729
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:09,460
Because I was like, who's the girl in the Hades art?

730
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:12,120
Or in the Game of the Year artwork.

731
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:14,180
This takes a village.

732
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:18,620
And oh my god, I love my passionate, yeah, Mel.

733
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:20,280
Mel?

734
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,360
I don't really know how to pronounce it.

735
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:23,760
Hooray wearing village.

one's actually fully normal life's fucking hard guys life's

745
00:57:54,920 --> 00:58:03,140
hard we've been so oh shit jj abrams to get to work with
some incredible artists to tell stories on stage, TV, and

746
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:03,480
film.

747
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:09,620
And it's been an absolute thrill and honor to have spent the
last few years working with a brilliant Mike Booth on an

748
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:13,940
original universe that brings our passion for great
storytelling to the PlayStation and PC.

749
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:16,080
Thank you, JJ.

750
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:24,300
At our Bad Robot Game Studio, working with our friends at
PlayStation, we've been creating a new kind of co-op game

751
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:28,160
that builds upon what I learned making Left 4 Dead.

752
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:33,160
The result is something entirely different.

753
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:40,040
An unpredictable, challenging combat sandbox where you
succeed through cooperation and improvisation.

754
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:44,760
And now I am excited to share a glimpse into what we've been
working on.

755
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:51,340
In fact, we're also inviting all of you to sign up for early
playtesting and check it out for yourselves.

756
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:53,940
But first, welcome to For Loop.

757
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:58,140
Welcome back, team.

758
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:00,760
Now, I need you to brace yourselves.

759
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:04,120
Earth was invaded.

760
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,100
Lost in less than a minute.

761
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,620
All of this was our fault.

762
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:16,560
We're the only ones left who can fix it.

763
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:20,320
And you must use our machine.

764
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:25,500
I swear to God, if this is an extraction shooter, JJ, I
swear to God.

765
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:26,420
I know what you're thinking.

766
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:27,840
This bloke's gone insane.

767
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:39,440
plan sounds impossible and we're probably going to die i
swear to god jj going to die it's all part of my new plan

768
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:50,740
every time you fail i will use our machine to bring you back
oh it's like that robert patterson movie what is it called

769
00:59:53,040 --> 01:00:15,220
it's literally the same plot test strategies learn from your
failures Mickey yeah Mickey 17 this feels very extraction

770
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:30,860
shooter JJ JJ why are you making another extraction shooter
play for loop for loop up next we have new game announcement

771
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:36,580
from some of the developers who helped put the last of us
and uncharted into our hands this new small independent

772
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:42,780
studio is charting its own course focused on crafting
uniquely styled artful games that are pushing the evolution

773
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:49,440
of companion characters enjoy oh is it like pokemon

774
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:56,500

01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:04,040
where are my companion characters this is just a forest

776
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:20,650
Hello, this is a human, not a companion monster.

777
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:26,860
Oh, there it is.

778
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:30,040
Oh, there's my Pokemans.

779
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:34,640
But don't use a ball device to capture.

780
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:35,900
You might get sued.

781
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:40,800
It's fucking crazy that got trademarked.

782
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,980
Yeah, now they lost it.

783
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:55,200
They lost the pattern because the judge was like, wait, this
is fucking crazy.

784
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:57,380
You can't pattern this.

785
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:58,960
Wait a minute.

786
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:00,760
Oh, this is like...

787
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:03,740
What game am I thinking of?

788
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:09,000
The guys who did Shadow Colossus, the one with the bird
monster thing?

01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:12,000
Or she does have chicken feet.

Oh my god, they're humping the electronics.

802
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:12,200
Oh, from Soma.

803
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:21,720
That's from the creators of Soma.

804
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:23,560
Oh, that's some creepy faces.

805
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,340

01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:19,760
Ant-T-O-S.

818
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:21,460
Ant-T-O-S.

819
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:23,340
I assume Antos.

820
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:27,720
Whoa, thank you for your one-stop.

821
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:28,380

Thank you.

823
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:34,900
Antos from Fracture Games, a sci-fi mystery and spiritual
successor to Soma, set on a repurposed hotel on the moon,

824
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:39,020
and yes, the unmistakable Stellan Skarsgarde will start in
the game.

825
01:04:39,020 --> 01:04:40,720
What is Stellan Skarsgarde?

826
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:44,480
It's time to reveal a new forceful void hunter in Hoyo
versus...

827
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:45,080
Pennywise?

828
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:46,260
ARPG.

829
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:48,020
That's the Pennywise out there.

830
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:51,600
Meet Ye Shuanguan, the first ever dual form agent.

831
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:52,200
Yeah.

832
01:04:52,780 --> 01:04:56,700
Actually, that game does look very interesting, though.

833
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:58,240
Never played Soma.

834
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:02,000
But I've heard everyone told me like Soma's really
interesting.

835
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,380
Like a really interesting game.

836
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:06,420
Is this Genshin?

837
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:15,340
Oh, ZZ's.

838
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:16,420
Oh, it's Zenless.

839
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:21,460

I like her design.

843
01:05:35,420 --> 01:05:36,180
It's like...

844
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:40,040
There's just something about like a tiny guy wielding a big
ass sword.

845
01:05:55,680 --> 01:06:02,100
Bro, everybody knows how to co-stream the game rewards
except me.

846
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:06,940
The saddest, everyone's like, co-streaming the game rewards.

847
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:09,300
And I'm just like, how the fuck do you do that?

848
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:09,860
Whatever.

849
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:17,980
Aw, checkies.

850
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:26,040
Look, more is critical than it is in co-streaming.

851
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:26,900
streaming it.

852
01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:29,320
I'm just as cool as him.

853
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:36,560
That game was so scary when I did like a playtest with Duby.

854
01:06:40,180 --> 01:06:41,420
It's like...

855
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:42,460
It's like...

856
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:43,160
I don't know.

857
01:06:43,220 --> 01:06:48,000
Maybe you'll get a gun later, but it felt like she
definitely could not hold a gun.

858
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:01,330
I hope they don't touch Timo.

859
01:07:02,370 --> 01:07:02,910
Or Timo?

860
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:05,310
Timo?

861
01:07:06,110 --> 01:07:06,650
Yeah, Timo.

862
01:07:08,170 --> 01:07:10,390
Because I know how tilting he is, apparently.

863
01:07:12,350 --> 01:07:13,170
What Timo?

864
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:14,710
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

865
01:07:19,670 --> 01:07:22,050
Oh, shit.

866
01:07:22,170 --> 01:07:23,070
Oh, she's in.

867
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:24,570
The girlfriend's in.

868
01:07:26,610 --> 01:07:35,130
For a limited time only, Prime members can go to amazon.com
slash the game awards to save up to $20 You get to save up

869
01:07:35,130 --> 01:07:38,010
to 25% off select nominees!

870
01:07:39,150 --> 01:07:40,830
Wait, who the fuck buys physical?

871
01:07:41,050 --> 01:07:42,030
Wait, no.

872
01:07:42,910 --> 01:07:45,410
From the award-winning games, Journey and Sky.

873
01:07:45,410 --> 01:07:48,030
I just realized it's like you can buy physical games.

874
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:51,050
That game company's CEO and creative director, Genova
Channel.

875
01:07:51,050 --> 01:07:52,970
I can't even put that on my PC.

876
01:07:54,690 --> 01:07:55,650
I do.

877
01:07:58,070 --> 01:08:01,230
But PCs don't even have the CD ports anymore.

878
01:08:02,910 --> 01:08:04,730
Just give you a fucking code.

879
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:08,650
And tonight's game for impact nominees.

880
01:08:08,990 --> 01:08:09,890
That's the worst part.

881
01:08:10,050 --> 01:08:14,190
You buy physical copy and like the inside is just a fucking
code.

882
01:08:16,590 --> 01:08:21,570
That's what like PC like that's what physical copies for PC
games are now.

883
01:08:21,610 --> 01:08:24,270
How interactive art bring us closer together.

884
01:08:24,270 --> 01:08:27,330
We get nothing but a goddamn paper with a code on it.

885
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:29,570
It's just an empty box.

886
01:08:30,350 --> 01:08:31,730
It's literally a fake physical.

887
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:42,980
I've never had any friends like you.

888
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:45,060
We forgot for a reason.

889
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:47,360
It's not safe out there, Hazel.

890
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:50,080
If I was the one missing, she wouldn't stop looking.

891
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:58,440
Graham, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

892
01:08:58,520 --> 01:08:58,780
Thank you.

893
01:08:58,880 --> 01:08:59,660
Thank you.

894
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:01,760
Yeah, you guys have an Amazon Prime.

895
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:04,260
You can subscribe to your favorite streamer for free.

896
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:05,220
I.e.

897
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:06,060
Jeff, I guess.

898
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:10,940
Because the chat is all Twitch Prime and Jeff's channel.

899
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:18,260
Guys, you can subscribe to your favorite streamer, Jeff,
once a year.

900
01:09:28,370 --> 01:09:29,830
Treen, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

901
01:09:29,990 --> 01:09:30,910
Thank you, thank you.

902
01:09:34,110 --> 01:09:37,710
No, every month, but Jeff only streams once a year.

903
01:09:38,490 --> 01:09:45,630
Imagine someone, like, every month that there's no Game of
the Year show, they still fucking subscribe to Twitch Prime

904
01:09:45,630 --> 01:09:45,890
him.

905
01:09:46,330 --> 01:09:55,850
I would like to share this award with all of you and of
course to our incredible team back home and every single

906
01:09:55,850 --> 01:09:58,570
players who's been part of this journey.

907
01:09:59,030 --> 01:10:00,290
Aw, that's sweet.

908
01:10:02,030 --> 01:10:04,170
From the start, we listen to...

909
01:10:04,170 --> 01:10:10,630
You can subscribe to your favorite streamer for free every
month, which is nice.

910
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:15,550
To build a world that would feel as warm and as rich as the
sun.

911
01:10:16,330 --> 01:10:17,250
one, guys.

912
01:10:17,650 --> 01:10:19,330
That's too busy showing Twitch Prime.

913
01:10:19,850 --> 01:10:20,190
Sorry.

914
01:10:22,370 --> 01:10:24,750
I'm too busy helping Jeff show Twitch Prime.

915
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:27,150
South of Midnight?

916
01:10:27,330 --> 01:10:27,490
Oh.

917
01:10:27,570 --> 01:10:31,290
We're incredibly excited to launch what was the category for
this?

918
01:10:31,630 --> 01:10:33,810
South of Midnight on PlayStation 5.

919
01:10:34,110 --> 01:10:34,710
Lucifer Khan.

920
01:10:36,050 --> 01:10:37,790
Thank you so much.

921
01:10:38,130 --> 01:10:38,470
Impact?

922
01:10:38,970 --> 01:10:39,250
Yay.

923
01:10:40,850 --> 01:10:42,210
Oh, they're also French.

924
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:46,310
Oh my god, this is actually going to be a French.

925
01:10:46,330 --> 01:10:47,670
French sweep.

926
01:10:48,650 --> 01:10:50,290
Teams with impact.

927
01:10:53,630 --> 01:10:58,350
Tonight, one of the most iconic survival horror franchises
returns to the Game Award stage.

928
01:10:58,610 --> 01:10:58,930
There's an EVA?

929
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:05,170
For nearly three decades, Resident Evil has defined what it
means to face the unknown.

930
01:11:05,330 --> 01:11:06,070
I knew it!

931
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:07,790
To survive against impossible odds.

932
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:13,530
This next installment, Resident Evil Requiem is a nominee
for most anticipated game.

933
01:11:13,890 --> 01:11:15,890
And tonight, we're excited to dive deeper.

934
01:11:16,330 --> 01:11:28,630
mess up for me to say i hope it's um i hope i hope it
doesn't like it's not what was it i hope it's not like

935
01:11:28,630 --> 01:11:32,090
people don't go in with too much high expectations like they
did with silent hill

936
01:11:41,050 --> 01:11:48,350
i hope this exceeds expectations or live up to it because i
heard i didn't play silent hill but i heard people were like

937
01:11:48,350 --> 01:11:59,730
yeah um people were like i wish we i lowered my expectations
to silent Oh yeah, apparently Leon's back and he's like 50

938
01:11:59,730 --> 01:12:00,790
now or some shit.

939
01:12:01,010 --> 01:12:02,250
Here we finally are.

940
01:12:03,890 --> 01:12:04,730
Who are you?

941
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:08,700
You're the one that I've been searching for.

942
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,740
Someone help Leon retire.

943
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:15,080
He's tired, man.

944
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:23,080
He's so fucking tired.

945
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:28,040
He's like, please, I don't want to go back to Raccoon City.

946
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:33,140
No, that's not Leon.

947
01:12:33,820 --> 01:12:34,680
Leon, don't worry.

948
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:35,720
He's still handsome.

949
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:37,100
He's like a delf now.

950
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:42,960
It might be unrelated, but he disappeared near where the
fifth body was found.

951
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:46,820
Oh, shit.

952
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:48,100
That's me.

953
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:52,420
My cameo.

954
01:12:52,420 --> 01:12:53,980
Elpis can finally be...

955
01:12:53,980 --> 01:12:54,900
My cameo.

956
01:12:55,060 --> 01:12:55,820
Me and my tooth.

957
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:57,040
I guess teeth.

958
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:03,040
The team has settled on a person of...

959
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:11,520

01:13:40,740 --> 01:13:43,160
Dr. Gideon has been expecting you.

963
01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:45,560
Oh, she looks normal at least.

964
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:49,240
Oh, there's Leon!

965
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:50,480
There he is!

966
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:51,220
You there, Leon?

967
01:13:51,340 --> 01:13:53,220
God, he's so fucking tired.

968
01:13:57,380 --> 01:13:59,440
He's so done.

969
01:14:02,620 --> 01:14:05,060
Like, stop bringing me back.

970
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:10,800
Bro, he...

971
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:11,000
Bro.

972
01:14:11,020 --> 01:14:12,940
Oh, he's so fucking tired.

973
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:14,380
Don't do anything stupid.

974
01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:16,020
Me?

975
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:17,780
Never.

976
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:23,500
Oh no, he's getting hotter!

977
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:29,680
Why is he still hot?

978
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:36,600
Oh, thank God.

979
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:37,500
We can actually play...

01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:40,300
Thank God!

big publisher system so we felt it was important to

988
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:22,860
spotlight those visionary projects tonight right alongside
the big franchises this next game is a good example it comes

989
01:15:22,860 --> 01:15:29,480
from a legendary name in the independent scene someone I
first met back in 2007 it's a project that has been ten

990
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:32,400
years in the making

991
01:15:42,490 --> 01:15:51,550
charm that goblin it's too far i'll swap him out what the

to the treasure just a few more minutes if you don't

994
01:16:14,030 --> 01:16:17,470
He sounds so happy with the idea that they might die.

995
01:16:18,030 --> 01:16:19,810
He's like, ha ha, we might die, guys.

996
01:16:20,110 --> 01:16:20,330
Ha ha.

997
01:16:23,690 --> 01:16:24,570
That's the

998
01:16:28,620 --> 01:16:30,840
sound guy.

999
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:32,280
Did it up the volume a little bit more?

1000
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:33,880
Let me know if it is too loud or not.

1001
01:16:34,580 --> 01:16:38,440
I had never imagined such a device that could fuse
realities.

1002
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:39,480
Whoa.

1003
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:41,160
Okay, brain hurt time.

1004
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:45,160
It weaves the very laws of nature into a composite hole.

1005
01:16:46,540 --> 01:16:52,200
result surprises me constantly but who yeah brain hurt now
and what do they

1006
01:17:00,390 --> 01:17:06,990
want yeah no i'm too dumb for the puzzle i i professor laden
is my most favorite game of all time like game series

1007
01:17:06,990 --> 01:17:12,530
adventure with over 1400 puzzles but like but that's
different i think professor laden is like a different type

1008
01:17:12,530 --> 01:17:18,670
of puzzle game than this traveling 40 000 years into the
future for a brand new look at exodus why not in here they

1009
01:17:18,670 --> 01:17:24,370

coast and archetype entertainment for decades wizards has

1010
01:17:24,370 --> 01:17:31,850
built worlds where players define their own legacies exodus
carries that tradition into the stars it's time to step

1011
01:17:31,850 --> 01:17:40,190
forward didn't the guy that originally made the puzzles for
professor laden died i remember maybe i'm making that up i

1012
01:17:40,190 --> 01:17:48,950
may be spreading fake news but i remember reading something
about like how like someone passed away in the professor

1013
01:17:48,950 --> 01:17:57,660
laden team celestials are the enemy of you How did he die?

1014
01:17:57,900 --> 01:18:00,220
Old age, because he's really old.

1015
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:03,960
Like, I hope I'm spreading fake news.

1016
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:11,160
I just remembered, like, the guy who fucking made majority
of the puzzles for Professor Layden is a very, very old man.

1017
01:18:24,620 --> 01:18:26,700
He's sure he didn't die.

1018
01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:27,680
I was like, how did he die?

1019
01:18:27,740 --> 01:18:28,840
I don't fuck know.

1020
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:33,220
When you get too old, then it has to stop one day.

1021
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:40,200
One day, it eventually stops.

1022
01:18:41,620 --> 01:18:47,760
It never stops, Toki.

1023
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:57,970
The crime never stops.

1024
01:18:58,850 --> 01:19:00,890
Yeah, this does look like Mass Effect.

1025
01:19:01,950 --> 01:19:03,330
What about the hot aliens?

1026
01:19:04,170 --> 01:19:05,130
What's the point?

1027
01:19:05,970 --> 01:19:08,370
Why is my crew fully human?

1028
01:19:08,490 --> 01:19:11,050
Are we, like, fucking discriminating?

1029
01:19:13,990 --> 01:19:14,590
Like...

1030
01:19:19,290 --> 01:19:20,650
Zeno, skull.

1031
01:19:23,710 --> 01:19:26,430
This is a human-only crew.

1032
01:19:26,830 --> 01:19:31,010
Bro, I could have a fucking bear in my crew and said I'm
beating it up.

1033
01:19:33,210 --> 01:19:35,530
No aliens on my shit.

1034
01:19:36,990 --> 01:19:51,640
how much are you willing to sacrifice to save your world I
mean the game really looks badass no pressure there the only

1035
01:19:51,640 --> 01:20:07,460
downside is that I can't kiss a hot alien on my crew Exodus
early 2027 oh my god that's far Exodus is coming in early

1036
01:20:07,460 --> 01:20:14,840
2027 and i'm very excited to play it but that's not all from
wizards of the coast tonight oh wizards from the coast oh

1037
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:21,680
yeah because it was like dungeons and dragons they're like
from the creators of dungeons and dragons

1038
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:40,460
wizard of the coast making video games surprising i'm not
i'm not because it's like it's like the next i feel like

1039
01:20:40,460 --> 01:20:47,880
that's the next step a new wizards of the coast studio where
i play the main character that's unlike anything i've done

1040
01:20:47,880 --> 01:21:03,850
before oh just owners not creators ah of what we've been
working on let's take a look all of this magic this pact we

1041
01:21:03,850 --> 01:21:09,210

1042
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:27,360
oh she turned gawth

1043
01:21:48,090 --> 01:21:52,330
twirl in a trailer what's What does that mean?

1044
01:21:58,890 --> 01:21:59,750
Oh, it's a band.

1045
01:22:00,350 --> 01:22:00,350
Oh!

1046
01:22:10,310 --> 01:22:11,150
I don't.

1047
01:22:12,050 --> 01:22:13,670
I'm bad with music.

1048
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:16,530
Warlock, Dungeons &...

1049
01:22:16,530 --> 01:22:16,770
Oh.

1050
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:18,930
Gameplay Revere.

1051
01:22:20,590 --> 01:22:21,110
Warlock.

1052
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:27,800
On Warlock coming in summer 2026.

1053
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:28,900
Oh, they're making two games.

1054
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:31,740
I mean, Warlock is coming up.

1055
01:22:32,060 --> 01:22:38,440
Coming up like Performance by Evanescence who are also
releasing a new version of their hit song Afterlife.

1056
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:39,960
Yeah, I was gonna say Avalescence.

1057
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:40,780
What?

1058
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:45,180
From labyrinth with Sonic the Hedgehog and Bill Murray.

1059
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:48,180
Not that Bill Murray, a different one with Cyberpunk Edge
Runners.

1060
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:49,780
Here is your first lesson.

1061
01:23:01,790 --> 01:23:02,830
Love, mom.

1062
01:23:06,570 --> 01:23:08,450
I did not expect that.

1063
01:23:13,570 --> 01:23:15,150
It's like, it's Sade!

1064
01:23:19,050 --> 01:23:22,510
Unfortunately that they made music for your devil make cry
to show.

1065
01:23:22,950 --> 01:23:23,710
It's very unfortunate.

1066
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:41,020
Very unfortunate because I think like only maybe like a
thousand people listened to that song.

1067
01:23:44,180 --> 01:23:45,840
Never saw the new devil make cry on me.

1068
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:46,340
Yeah, me too.

1069
01:23:47,380 --> 01:23:49,240
warned me that it was really bad.

1070
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:54,320
I didn't bother.

1071
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:56,880
Oh hey, E33.

1072
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:02,380
They gave him the 100 biddies, they could thank him!

1073
01:24:03,420 --> 01:24:07,580
Their brands were still on fire and their hoods were made of
steel.

1074
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:13,960
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he
could feel.

1075
01:24:22,380 --> 01:24:25,720
No, it's just the Xbox Game Pass.

1076
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:31,320
You guys might have missed it, but they're advertising the
Game Pass right now.

1077
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:34,980
I hear all the games in the Xbox Game Pass.

1078
01:24:38,700 --> 01:24:41,140
Yeah, unfortunately, this is an in-show.

1079
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:42,900
I mean, the entire thing is an ad.

1080
01:24:46,380 --> 01:24:48,560
Oh, this is a cabin game, isn't it?

1081
01:24:56,340 --> 01:24:57,060
Yeah,

1082
01:25:01,660 --> 01:25:03,600
this entire show is not technically.

1083
01:25:05,780 --> 01:25:07,920
I told you guys, this is Super Bowl of ads.

1084
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:14,140
This is the gamer Super Bowl.

1085
01:25:22,780 --> 01:25:23,740
He's here.

1086
01:25:24,780 --> 01:25:25,200
It's him.

1087
01:25:26,340 --> 01:25:27,180
It's Gabrielle.

1088
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:30,520
What?

1089
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:33,140
What is this?

1090
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:39,500
What?

1091
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:53,340
Is this a show or a game?

1092
01:26:00,610 --> 01:26:02,450
I feel like this has to be a show, right?

1093
01:26:03,310 --> 01:26:03,890
Oh,

1094
01:26:08,030 --> 01:26:08,570
it's a game.

1095
01:26:09,510 --> 01:26:11,090
The Screamer tournament is about to be announced.

1096
01:26:11,810 --> 01:26:13,190
Held by a Mr. A.

1097
01:26:14,770 --> 01:26:15,570
Consider this.

1098
01:26:16,110 --> 01:26:17,670
Your personal invitation.

1099
01:26:18,270 --> 01:26:19,910
Burn alive, you piece of shit.

1100
01:26:22,930 --> 01:26:25,010
It's like, um...

1101
01:26:25,010 --> 01:26:25,790
It's like...

1102
01:26:25,790 --> 01:26:26,130
What is it?

1103
01:26:26,130 --> 01:26:27,330
It's like this patchy.

1104
01:26:27,450 --> 01:26:29,270
Where like...

1105
01:26:29,270 --> 01:26:31,410
Maybe like...

1106
01:26:31,410 --> 01:26:34,090
A like visual novel with the game.

1107
01:26:34,370 --> 01:26:35,610
Or like cutscenes with the game.

1108
01:26:36,550 --> 01:26:37,230
Screamer.

1109
01:26:42,130 --> 01:26:46,430
Welcome back to the Game Awards, and now it's time for a
game announcement for a studio...

1110
01:26:46,430 --> 01:26:47,370
I'm racing in my anime.

1111
01:26:48,330 --> 01:26:49,350
The limits of storytelling.

1112
01:26:49,510 --> 01:26:50,150
Never die!

1113
01:26:50,370 --> 01:26:56,410
They captivate us with worlds that bend reality and stories
that blur the line between ordinary and the impossible.

1114
01:26:56,870 --> 01:27:02,070
They're one of the most distinct voices in our industry, and
whenever they show up, you know you're about to see

1115
01:27:02,070 --> 01:27:04,790
something unlike anything else.

1116
01:27:08,150 --> 01:27:09,030
What's this?

1117
01:27:09,030 --> 01:27:11,670
is this

1118
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:24,080
music what the fuck kojima i'm sorry this is how it's like
kojamba

1119
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:35,520
is he gonna do it again this

1120
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:44,560
looks very kojamba-ish guys that

1121
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:50,600
Or control.

1122
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:51,700
Or control.

1123
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:52,200
I was going to say.

1124
01:27:53,660 --> 01:27:55,880
It looks like control too.

1125
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:10,880
Oh, is that the control lady?

1126
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:11,840
I saw it.

1127
01:28:11,980 --> 01:28:15,500
It looked like the style from the devs behind.

1128
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:16,900
What are you doing, they made?

1129
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:23,220
Something is coming.

1130
01:28:23,380 --> 01:28:24,320
He's in the cube.

1131
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:26,680
Oh.

1132
01:28:30,570 --> 01:28:31,390
Oh, God.

1133
01:28:31,450 --> 01:28:31,990
That's so true.

1134
01:28:32,010 --> 01:28:32,730
Triffy.

1135
01:28:34,670 --> 01:28:38,150
Yeah, Max Payne.

1136
01:28:38,470 --> 01:28:41,530
Max Payne and Alan Wake.

1137
01:28:44,370 --> 01:28:45,350
Oh, I don't...

1138
01:28:45,350 --> 01:28:46,950
Oh, I don't like this.

1139
01:28:47,610 --> 01:28:49,310
Oh, seizure warning.

1140
01:28:56,160 --> 01:28:57,780
Yeah, that's trippy.

1141
01:28:58,540 --> 01:29:01,260
I thought he was like, bar, game pass now.

1142
01:29:02,180 --> 01:29:03,940
It's like the hypnoprag.

1143
01:29:03,940 --> 01:29:11,210
Oh shit, Inception!

1144
01:29:14,330 --> 01:29:16,610
Wait, this is so Inception-like.

1145
01:29:21,130 --> 01:29:22,470
Oh god.

1146
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:31,520
This has to be in the control universe, right?

1147
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:36,400
Because it's like the SCP shit.

1148
01:29:57,520 --> 01:29:58,040
Oh

1149
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:02,820
Hey, he got a bigger cube.

1150
01:30:03,140 --> 01:30:04,660
It's now a rectangle

1151
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:15,420
Yay Rise and shine

1152
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:24,000
Oh Shit

1153
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:34,300
What the fuck Oh my

1154
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:46,700
god What the fuck is going on outside?

1155
01:30:49,540 --> 01:30:51,580
That's a big ass hammer.

1156
01:30:53,660 --> 01:30:55,060
Oh shit.

1157
01:30:57,500 --> 01:30:59,560
That's so fucking trippy.

1158
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:02,120
Oh my god.

1159
01:31:12,970 --> 01:31:13,570
Jesus.

1160
01:31:15,250 --> 01:31:17,530
That is so fucking trippy.

1161
01:31:21,940 --> 01:31:22,760
Yeah, there's, yeah.

1162
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:25,960
Oh yeah, it does look Devil May Cry-ish with the gameplay.

1163
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:30,540
The fights look so fucking trippy too.

1164
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:35,380
Dude, he was like upside down at one point.

1165
01:31:35,620 --> 01:31:36,400
That is a good one.

1166
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:43,860
Control Resonant is coming in 2026 from the Masters at
Remedy Entertainment in Finland whose last game, Alan Wake,

1167
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:48,400
won multiple awards here at the Game Awards in 2023,
including Best Game Direction.

1168
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:54,620
It is always exciting to have past TGA winners return to our
show to showcase their upcoming projects.

1169
01:31:54,700 --> 01:31:55,640
I wanted to get a discount.

awards including best score and music best narrative best

1176
01:32:34,660 --> 01:32:38,480
That's a place to share the first details and in-engine
footage with the world.

1177
01:32:45,150 --> 01:32:45,390
What?

1178
01:32:47,590 --> 01:32:48,450
Is this Yakuza?

1179
01:32:55,580 --> 01:32:57,340
Yeah, it looks like Yakuza.

1180
01:33:06,170 --> 01:33:06,850
What?

1181
01:33:08,590 --> 01:33:10,770
Did you just see it?

1182
01:33:10,770 --> 01:33:11,750
Bro, did you just see it?

1183
01:33:11,950 --> 01:33:13,910

1184
01:33:15,050 --> 01:33:16,070

01:34:16,350 --> 01:34:19,470

Yakuza if it was real Yeah, yeah, that's basically it If

Isn't that Key from Key and Peel?

01:35:40,070 --> 01:35:41,730
That guy looks like Ludwig.

1204
01:35:46,850 --> 01:35:48,530
Yeah, I was gonna say Ludwig.

1205
01:35:53,270 --> 01:35:55,690
Yeah, dude, I think I saw Eric Andre.

1206
01:35:56,290 --> 01:35:57,850
Bro, I think I saw him too.

1207
01:35:58,190 --> 01:36:01,750
Well, the fiercest fighters have gathered to stake their
claim.

1208
01:36:03,130 --> 01:36:06,090
Time to meet some of the warriors stepping into the ring.

1209
01:36:07,130 --> 01:36:08,810
Eric Andre.

1210
01:36:09,550 --> 01:36:10,590
Eric Andre.

1211
01:36:15,990 --> 01:36:25,410
Now, where is Zambi?

1212
01:36:25,950 --> 01:36:26,830
Excuse me.

1213
01:36:27,130 --> 01:36:31,230
You can't have a street fighter without his loyal fans.

1214
01:36:33,130 --> 01:36:34,710
Oh my god, Cody Rhodes.

1215
01:36:34,930 --> 01:36:35,650
That's crazy.

1216
01:36:45,390 --> 01:36:48,150
Where the fuck is my Eric Andre?

1217
01:36:50,470 --> 01:36:50,690
Woo!

1218
01:36:52,490 --> 01:36:54,870
Oh my god, he does look like him.

1219
01:36:55,530 --> 01:36:57,050
My loyal fans!

1220
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:04,540
Oh my god, Jay!

1221
01:37:09,020 --> 01:37:11,820
Jason Mamoa as a Blanca!

1222
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:13,960
What?

1223
01:37:15,060 --> 01:37:18,440
They got Mr. Mamoa?

1224
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:25,840
What the fuck is he blocked?

1225
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:26,780
Oh my god.

1226
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:29,620
Still cheaper than the cast of Avengers.

1227
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:31,040
That's the craziest part.

1228
01:37:31,580 --> 01:37:33,880
Still cheaper than getting the cast of Avengers.

1229
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:42,800
Now I know our movie comes out like a year from now, but
there was no Bro, Jason is having a sad quest right now.

1230
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:44,780
He got announced to be like, what's his name?

1231
01:37:44,860 --> 01:37:45,260
Lobo?

1232
01:37:46,040 --> 01:37:47,060
Is it Lobo?

1233
01:37:48,040 --> 01:37:48,940
From DC?

1234
01:37:49,540 --> 01:37:50,240
On camera.

1235
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:51,820
I kind of miss that, guys.

1236
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:52,800
We miss it too.

1237
01:37:53,260 --> 01:37:53,920
Yeah, Lobo.

1238
01:37:54,060 --> 01:37:54,820
Sorry, Lobo.

1239
01:37:55,100 --> 01:37:58,180
Yeah, he got announced as Lobo yesterday or today.

1240
01:37:58,460 --> 01:38:00,540
And now he got announced as Licky Blanca.

1241
01:38:00,940 --> 01:38:02,400
He didn't hire me to play Blanca.

1242
01:38:03,560 --> 01:38:05,040
True story, words matter.

1243
01:38:05,180 --> 01:38:07,460
I think Jason Mamoa took up 70% of it.

1244
01:38:07,480 --> 01:38:16,120
of the casting budget there's no fucking way where the fuck
is eric andre i what is eric andre

1245
01:38:20,860 --> 01:38:27,640
the games in this category are the ones that never quit
delivering all year long they keep us looking forward yeah

1246
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:37,060
no he is a perfect lobo i will say he is a perfect lobo but
like him as blanca was like surprising we need more

they also flew from around the world to be here because they
appreciate you.

1252
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:13,840
So give it up for the whole cast of Mortal Kombat 2.

1253
01:39:18,280 --> 01:39:19,100
I'm just kidding.

1254
01:39:19,220 --> 01:39:19,700
I'm just kidding.

1255
01:39:19,820 --> 01:39:20,240
They didn't come.

1256
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:21,040
They don't care about you.

1257
01:39:21,240 --> 01:39:23,600
I'm not feeling immersed right now.

1258
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:26,140
Damn.

1259
01:39:27,660 --> 01:39:30,060
Guys, someone take his mic away, guys.

1260
01:39:30,200 --> 01:39:31,060
He's joking.

1261
01:39:32,060 --> 01:39:34,580
Someone take his mic away.

1262
01:39:35,160 --> 01:39:36,540
For best ongoing game.

1263
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:36,720
Woo!

1264
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:39,360
Best ongoing game.

1265
01:39:40,540 --> 01:39:44,060
I'll protect my people's happiness to the last.

1266
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:45,980
It cuts out my gap.

1267
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:48,460
I can't believe it.

1268
01:39:48,580 --> 01:39:51,780
Eric Andre didn't come to the game.

1269
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:54,580
He's too good for the game awards.

1270
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,840
Guys, I'm so sad.

1271
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:57,660
Oh, hey, my vavas.

1272
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:02,540
We couldn't have burst keep my vavas.

1273
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:06,620
I can't believe Nomad's guy is going so strong.

1274
01:40:06,740 --> 01:40:07,480
You know, my...

1275
01:40:07,480 --> 01:40:09,920
I saw a clip like...

1276
01:40:11,020 --> 01:40:12,400
a couple of days ago.

1277
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:13,060
Oh, the mic's not coming out of the floor.

1278
01:40:13,160 --> 01:40:15,000
I thought I was coming out of the floor.

1279
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:20,180
And the game award goes to No Man's Sky.

1280
01:40:20,180 --> 01:40:21,160
Oh, shit!

1281
01:40:23,480 --> 01:40:24,500
That's crazy.

1282
01:40:24,580 --> 01:40:25,880
I did not expect that.

1283
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,660
Yeah, that's the redemption arc right there.

1284
01:40:30,760 --> 01:40:37,820
Okay, so the last time, the last I saw a clip of No Man's
Sky, but apparently some dude found the planet in No Man's

1285
01:40:37,820 --> 01:40:39,440
Sky that randomly generated.

1286
01:40:39,720 --> 01:40:49,580
We're all the month where all the citizens were just penises
did you guys see that clip and the guy was riding a dick

1287
01:40:49,580 --> 01:41:03,020
it's just fancy yeah someone found a randomly generated
world where it was just peepies everywhere he was like

1288
01:41:03,020 --> 01:41:12,800
riding like a horse the fact that it was randomly generated
dude that's like I'm slightly jet lagged myself.

1289
01:41:13,260 --> 01:41:14,600
Oh, let me see if I can find this clip.

1290
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:15,840
I'm just going to be very sorry he isn't here.

1291
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:20,640
I'm also slightly sorry he's not here because this is way
more than our friend.

1292
01:41:22,040 --> 01:41:25,000
I guess I was like, look at this.

1293
01:41:25,180 --> 01:41:36,360
But, you know, just that our tiny, massive, impossible space
game still means something to so many people that we get to

1294
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:38,160
keep on making a game that we love.

1295
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:39,980
That is a real privilege.

1296
01:41:40,500 --> 01:41:45,000
You know, that we are able to be here on a stage surrounded
by so many incredible games.

1297
01:41:45,740 --> 01:41:47,260
Like, that is really special.

1298
01:41:47,640 --> 01:41:48,740
I should have bookmarked it, guys.

1299
01:41:49,620 --> 01:41:51,180
It's like a sharer to the class.

1300
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:52,080
Thank you so much.

1301
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:53,040
All right, let me...

1302
01:41:53,680 --> 01:41:54,620
I'll find it.

1303
01:41:54,660 --> 01:41:55,100
Don't worry.

1304
01:41:55,220 --> 01:41:56,860
Now I am committed.

1305
01:41:59,140 --> 01:42:00,600
No man's Skype.

1306
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:03,960
EGIS.

1307
01:42:08,540 --> 01:42:09,480
Oh, there you go.

1308
01:42:10,700 --> 01:42:11,320
There.

1309
01:42:12,220 --> 01:42:14,500
This was a randomly generated world.

1310
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:20,060
I think that's the craziest part.

1311
01:42:20,420 --> 01:42:21,220
No Man's Sky.

1312
01:42:21,640 --> 01:42:23,180
And how about the Street Fighter cast?

1313
01:42:23,340 --> 01:42:24,560
That was absolutely wild.

1314
01:42:25,020 --> 01:42:25,020
Alright.

1315
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:30,460
There's lots more game awards ahead, including a very
special announcement.

1316
01:42:31,580 --> 01:42:32,780
Oh, Batman!

1317
01:42:34,180 --> 01:42:35,400
Well, we'll pick it up, I guess.

1318
01:42:35,480 --> 01:42:37,940
They got released before Netflix buys the company.

1319
01:42:38,120 --> 01:42:39,240
Oh, it's Lego Batman.

1320
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:41,260
All the way from Gotham City.

1321
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:44,000
Lego Gotham.

1322
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:44,260
How you doing, buddy?

1323
01:42:44,380 --> 01:42:45,200
It's great to see you tonight.

1324
01:42:45,380 --> 01:42:46,220
You having a good time?

1325
01:42:46,580 --> 01:42:47,420
Commissioner Keeley.

1326
01:42:48,200 --> 01:42:49,780
Sorry I couldn't make it in person.

1327
01:42:50,540 --> 01:42:52,100
I've been trying to decide what bats are doing.

1328
01:42:52,100 --> 01:42:52,960
Yeah, that's not Will Arnett.

1329
01:42:53,540 --> 01:42:55,200
Abs or no abs.

1330
01:42:55,960 --> 01:42:57,700
Anyway, great show so far.

1331
01:42:58,140 --> 01:42:59,620
But it's about to get even better.

1332
01:43:00,100 --> 01:43:02,960
Because it's time for a new look at my upcoming game.

1333
01:43:03,460 --> 01:43:04,300
Lego Batman.

1334
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:06,360
Legacy of the Dark Knight.

1335
01:43:07,880 --> 01:43:08,540
Batman out.

1336
01:43:10,020 --> 01:43:11,820
Will Arnett was too expensive.

1337
01:43:14,440 --> 01:43:22,520
guys you gotta release this before netflix buys everything

Oh, shit.

1342
01:44:01,030 --> 01:44:03,010
That's classic Catwoman, too.

1343
01:44:04,630 --> 01:44:07,410
This town deserves a better class of criminal.

1344
01:44:09,190 --> 01:44:11,270
Good evening, Gotham.

1345
01:44:11,950 --> 01:44:16,890
Join us in a celebration of absolute chaos.

1346
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:29,940
Let's get to the root of the problem.

1347
01:44:30,900 --> 01:44:31,640
We don't do that.

1348
01:44:36,160 --> 01:44:38,040
This is a serious game, Robin.

1349
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:43,920
Oh shit, yeah, these are all the movie Batman.

1350
01:44:45,180 --> 01:44:46,380
That was Arnold.

1351
01:44:49,820 --> 01:44:52,080
That was Arnold Iceman.

1352
01:44:52,600 --> 01:44:53,400
Not Iceman, sorry.

01:48:20,710 --> 01:48:21,970

01:48:23,990 --> 01:48:25,230

1402
01:48:31,570 --> 01:48:33,570

1403
01:48:35,810 --> 01:48:38,930
Bro, is that gonna burn my fucking phone?

1404
01:48:39,630 --> 01:48:40,510
Felicia Day.

Oh, Felicia Day.

1406
01:48:41,970 --> 01:48:43,130
I've seen her in so long.

1407
01:48:43,250 --> 01:48:46,490
But she was like the nerd actress for everyone.

1408
01:48:46,610 --> 01:48:51,510
It was like every nerd's like celebrity crush back in the
day.

1409

01:48:59,810 --> 01:48:59,930
industry.

Over the past 12 years, Girls Make Games has empowered over
8,000.

Oh.

1426
01:49:27,790 --> 01:49:34,110
In 2022, GMG established a college scholarship to bridge the
gap for young women as they entered college and careers.

1427
01:49:34,130 --> 01:49:36,230
Did it just, was it just low quality?

1428
01:49:36,410 --> 01:49:41,490
Due to their mission statement, the founders of this
incredible organization chose two inspiring members of their

escape and we wanted this game to be creepy but not too

1435
01:50:43,670 --> 01:50:50,030
scary so everyone can play well what great opportunity for

1437
01:50:59,850 --> 01:51:09,010
someone so young i'm personally super excited to see the
prototype we made at camp turn into a full-fledged game

1438
01:51:09,010 --> 01:51:14,570
especially for like yeah it's like it's literally a game jam

turnips do you have turnips in your game um you can look on

1440
01:51:22,430 --> 01:51:29,610
that um so monica your journey is a little bit different
with gmg um you never went to the camp but you actually were

1441
01:51:29,610 --> 01:51:37,030
one of the recipients girl this is a scary game we ain't
growing anything so i grew up loving video games she's like

1442
01:51:37,030 --> 01:51:44,050
did you die here this is a scary puzzle game my high school
robotics teacher actually encouraged me to apply for the

1443
01:51:44,050 --> 01:51:50,470
scholarship he knew I was interested in game development
then I got it now I'm attending USC and I've been doing some

1444
01:51:50,470 --> 01:51:58,110
game development you're not a child I've actually had some
game development experience with our club there open alpha

1445
01:51:58,110 --> 01:52:06,050
at USC it's amazing it sounds like it's really helped you
set you up for success is there any message that you'd like

1446
01:52:06,050 --> 01:52:11,750
to give girls out there who might dream of making their own
video games one day yeah I think if you're someone out there

1447
01:52:11,750 --> 01:52:13,890
with an interest in making give you a video game.

1448
01:52:13,910 --> 01:52:15,650
I didn't even have a robotics program.

1449
01:52:15,990 --> 01:52:20,830
You never know where that interest could take you, and
there's a ton of amazing programs, like girls make games,

1450
01:52:21,090 --> 01:52:22,170
who want to see you succeed.

1451
01:52:22,530 --> 01:52:27,470
Yeah, well, obviously, I really wish that they had been in
an organization like this when I was a kid, but I'm very

1452
01:52:27,470 --> 01:52:32,330
excited that starting next year, my eight-year-old daughter
can go to GMG and express her love of gaming.

1453
01:52:32,430 --> 01:52:33,730
You guys are very inspirational.

1454
01:52:34,230 --> 01:52:34,870
Thank you.

1455
01:52:36,150 --> 01:52:37,230
I have a grudge.

1456
01:52:37,470 --> 01:52:39,250
I didn't get to grow up with this.

1457
01:52:39,430 --> 01:52:40,510
It's not fair.

1458
01:52:40,990 --> 01:52:41,550
Oh, my God.

1459
01:52:41,910 --> 01:52:42,530
Okay.

1460
01:52:43,070 --> 01:52:43,290
What?

1461
01:52:49,270 --> 01:52:54,470
Congratulations and a huge thanks to Monica Perez and Ellie
Bowen for accepting on behalf of GMG.

1462
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:00,040
Yay.

1463
01:53:04,620 --> 01:53:05,140
Yeah.

1464
01:53:05,500 --> 01:53:05,540
Yeah.

1465
01:53:05,540 --> 01:53:07,140
Is this what the kids say these days?

1466
01:53:07,300 --> 01:53:07,860
Do you think?

1467
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:09,960
Thank you so much.

1468
01:53:09,960 --> 01:53:11,600
Am I hit with the children?

1469
01:53:12,160 --> 01:53:12,300
Congratulations to girls games.

1470
01:53:12,720 --> 01:53:13,640
It's an incredible program.

1471
01:53:13,660 --> 01:53:19,820
I've had the chance to visit their summer camps in the past
and it is truly inspiring See the passion and the creativity

1472
01:53:19,820 --> 01:53:25,060
that these young developers bring to the medium initiatives
like that don't just open doors I still oh my gosh if you

1473
01:53:25,060 --> 01:53:36,320
guys didn't know Overwatch released a new update to soldier
76 called the soldier 67 When he says sick where you can

1474
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:43,540
have an emote where he literally says six seven and then
people are like what do like so people are getting emoted by

1475
01:53:43,660 --> 01:53:50,380
soldier players now like soldiers like kill someone and then
do like six seven like emotes six seven on them and people

1476
01:53:50,380 --> 01:53:58,920
like and then people are supposed to be like what the do i
do do i just uninstall or do what they're like what the do i

1477
01:53:58,920 --> 01:54:07,480
do now do i uninstall this game i've heard a dozen tales
that say you're unstoppable

1478
01:54:15,500 --> 01:54:19,160
Year-wise, Soldier is a Gen Alpha.

1479
01:54:19,500 --> 01:54:22,580
For those who don't know, Overwatch is said in the future.

1480
01:54:23,280 --> 01:54:26,880
And Soldier 76 was technically...

1481
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:29,700
It's technically boring when Gen Alpha was a thing.

1482
01:54:30,260 --> 01:54:31,920
So he grew up with 6-7.

1483
01:54:33,560 --> 01:54:35,100
Oh hey, there's Lara Croft.

1484
01:54:39,900 --> 01:54:41,900
Yeah, it's a lore-accurate meme.

1485
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:44,840
So he's reciting the old memes in Overwatch.

1486
01:54:52,100 --> 01:54:55,100
No, it's Lord Akron.

1487
01:54:59,080 --> 01:55:01,720
And it's fucking hilarious, though.

1488
01:55:02,300 --> 01:55:03,280
Because people are like, do I...

1489
01:55:03,280 --> 01:55:03,960
What do I do?

1490
01:55:03,980 --> 01:55:05,120
Do I undersell the game?

1491
01:55:05,200 --> 01:55:07,080
Do I fucking kill myself in Minecraft?

1492
01:55:07,500 --> 01:55:08,460
The fuck if I...

1493
01:55:11,560 --> 01:55:14,400
Must be tough getting emoted like that.

1494
01:55:14,400 --> 01:55:15,820
Story

1495
01:55:19,100 --> 01:55:19,920
began.

1496
01:55:22,620 --> 01:55:24,400
And everything changed.

1497
01:55:35,660 --> 01:55:38,080
And this is on Game Studios.

1498
01:55:38,540 --> 01:55:39,440
Guys, I...

1499
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:42,020
Oh, that's tough.

1500
01:55:43,140 --> 01:55:44,000
That's rough.

1501
01:55:47,800 --> 01:55:49,420
Yeah, I was gonna say.

1502
01:55:49,900 --> 01:55:51,500
I sort of... I don't know.

1503
01:55:54,320 --> 01:55:55,680
I don't know.

1504
01:55:55,680 --> 01:55:57,940
It's by Amazon Games, guys.

1505
01:55:59,160 --> 01:56:01,320
Like, that's rough, buddy.

1506
01:56:06,640 --> 01:56:09,040
And for that reason, I'm out.

1507
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:16,280
This is pre-rendered, though.

1508
01:56:16,640 --> 01:56:17,460
I mean, it looks good.

1509
01:56:17,560 --> 01:56:18,960
The thing is, this is pre-rendered.

1510
01:56:21,420 --> 01:56:25,240
What the fuck is your dinosaurs doing in my lark?

1511
01:56:25,680 --> 01:56:39,380
I can't believe Lara killed off the dinosaurs.

1512
01:56:42,700 --> 01:56:43,980
I've always been dinosaurs.

1513
01:56:44,940 --> 01:56:46,800
I didn't grow up with Lara craft games.

1514
01:56:47,460 --> 01:56:52,240
So I wasn't aware that dinosaurs existed in the games.

1515
01:56:52,300 --> 01:56:53,680
I mean, I know dinosaurs are real.

1516
01:56:55,680 --> 01:56:57,320
But you know what I mean?

1517

Boob is a boob.

1540
01:59:13,540 --> 01:59:15,520

02:05:10,770 --> 02:05:13,900
So, this trip's theme is back to school, huh?

1633
02:05:15,370 --> 02:05:17,670
Welcome to Star Torch Academy.

1634
02:05:19,690 --> 02:05:20,750
Squaring Ways?

1635
02:05:21,990 --> 02:05:27,830
Yeah, I heard, like, I mean, I heard it's still very popular
in its, like, in the genre it is in.

1636
02:05:34,780 --> 02:05:40,520
I think Silk Song, it's just unfortunate that Silk Song
released around the time that...

1637
02:05:40,520 --> 02:05:43,300
I think it's... I think everybody expected Silk Song to be
released.

1638
02:05:43,320 --> 02:05:51,560
really good but no one expected like like uh e33 e33 to come
out like no one because the e33 was like a game that came

1639
02:05:51,560 --> 02:05:56,920
out of nowhere almost well not nowhere but like no one
really had like super high expectations about it because it

1640
02:05:56,920 --> 02:06:05,160
was a debut game so then like so obviously like uh it was
very unexpected so more people are like more hyped about it

1641
02:06:05,160 --> 02:06:10,780
because of how they didn't expect it to like expect it at
all but soxon everyone had high expectations about it

1642
02:06:14,500 --> 02:06:17,240
Yeah, and there was a lot of competition too

1643
02:06:32,500 --> 02:06:41,360
I also hope that Claire had a really good soundtrack too The
most valuable jewel in the game Earn them by playing the

1644
02:06:41,360 --> 02:06:45,160
stuff you love I heard about the soundtrack from Claire.

1645
02:06:46,520 --> 02:06:48,100
Score the latest IRL swag.

1646
02:06:49,620 --> 02:06:52,340
Or up your game with limited edition merch.

1647
02:06:54,300 --> 02:06:57,080
Victory is yours and so are rewards.

1648
02:06:57,760 --> 02:06:59,500
No, I haven't played it because it's a...

1649
02:07:00,160 --> 02:07:05,060
I know the type of game, the game genre, it doesn't match
like my playstyle.

1650
02:07:10,750 --> 02:07:16,070
It's not the type of game I know I would like enjoy as much
as like the other people would.

1651
02:07:22,900 --> 02:07:24,020
What's this?

1652
02:07:24,960 --> 02:07:25,700
This power?

1653
02:07:29,530 --> 02:07:31,610
Oh, is this the Yen-Cin power?

1654
02:07:34,770 --> 02:07:35,970
Oh, it's...

1655
02:07:35,970 --> 02:07:37,430
Oh, wait, it's...

1656
02:07:37,430 --> 02:07:38,350
It's another power.

1657
02:07:42,780 --> 02:07:44,400
Nope, it's the other one.

1658
02:07:44,680 --> 02:07:46,220
There's so many powers.

1659
02:07:52,760 --> 02:07:54,620
Wait, which power is this?

1660
02:07:54,700 --> 02:07:55,720
I've lost track.

1661
02:07:59,140 --> 02:08:01,860
Eternal, thank you for tier one sub, thank you, thank you.

1662
02:08:03,380 --> 02:08:03,920
Animo.

1663
02:08:08,930 --> 02:08:10,150
It's a new power.

1664
02:08:10,530 --> 02:08:10,770
Oh.

1665
02:08:17,110 --> 02:08:24,970
This reminds me of that country star that did like a fucking
satanic, like, visuals for a country song in the sphere.

1666
02:08:28,910 --> 02:08:29,670
Was this Diablo?

Oh, I knew it is Diablo.

1672
02:09:20,260 --> 02:09:22,620
It looked very Diablo-esque with his eye.

1673
02:09:27,230 --> 02:09:30,370
I mean, the design itself was very Diablo.

1674
02:09:33,840 --> 02:09:35,000
Um, no, no, no.

1675
02:09:35,080 --> 02:09:36,500
He didn't call me out.

1676
02:09:36,640 --> 02:09:37,840
He called out Shroud.

1677
02:09:41,620 --> 02:09:43,980
He didn't call me out.

1678
02:10:01,840 --> 02:10:03,860
Is this a Diablo DLC?

1679
02:10:07,510 --> 02:10:08,930
Please be for mobile.

1680
02:10:27,350 --> 02:10:30,270
Oh shit, that's hardcore bro.

1681
02:10:31,610 --> 02:10:32,910
What happens when you kill a demon?

1682
02:10:33,030 --> 02:10:35,250
Don't they just revive themselves back in hell?

1683
02:10:36,090 --> 02:10:36,730
Oh!

1684
02:10:37,430 --> 02:10:38,190
Oh!

1685
02:10:39,210 --> 02:10:39,370
Oh!

1686
02:10:39,590 --> 02:10:40,130
Oh!

1687
02:10:40,450 --> 02:10:42,330
Holy fuck!

1688
02:10:46,660 --> 02:10:47,860
Oh my god!

1689
02:10:47,960 --> 02:10:48,700
Oh shit!

1690
02:10:50,740 --> 02:10:51,460
God.

1691
02:10:52,120 --> 02:11:00,620
Despite like, you know, everything that's happened with
Blizzard games, their cinematics are still like so good.

1692
02:11:09,100 --> 02:11:11,220
Yeah, the cinematics are still- Oh!

1693
02:11:13,320 --> 02:11:15,420
Prepare for the reckoning!

1694
02:11:17,360 --> 02:11:22,720
Honestly, I- I wish they would like pivot to animation.

1695
02:11:23,960 --> 02:11:26,080
I missed the Overwatch Cinematics.

1696
02:11:26,480 --> 02:11:27,660
See you look, it's TLC.

1697
02:11:29,060 --> 02:11:30,260
Want to know who else is here?

1698
02:11:30,600 --> 02:11:34,340
Well, it's time for an update from Marvel Rivals, a nominee
tonight.

1699
02:11:34,660 --> 02:11:40,460
The best ongoing game about the latest Marvel hero set to
join the game in 2026.

1700
02:11:45,580 --> 02:11:47,400
How did she do it, guys?

1701
02:11:48,760 --> 02:11:50,720
He's trying to blast my ass if you know he won't.

1702
02:11:50,860 --> 02:11:52,780
I got a surprise for her.

1703
02:11:56,040 --> 02:11:58,260
She has the script.

1704
02:11:59,700 --> 02:12:00,600
This is gonna be fun.

1705
02:12:00,600 --> 02:12:01,100
Get her.

1706
02:12:02,840 --> 02:12:04,920
The MDA dokey.

1707
02:12:05,260 --> 02:12:06,540
I'm the one who set you free.

1708
02:12:07,200 --> 02:12:09,960
Oh, hey, this was not the plan.

1709
02:12:11,240 --> 02:12:13,060
Okay, guys, guys.

1710
02:12:13,260 --> 02:12:25,160
The only reason I knew that it was Deadpool was because
Deadpool was was released on December 11th and guess what

1711
02:12:25,160 --> 02:12:26,620
day is it today

1712
02:12:30,760 --> 02:12:33,120
it was so obvious

1713
02:12:39,760 --> 02:12:43,300
Donkey Kong was gonna fucking get you

1714
02:12:50,320 --> 02:12:52,600
I'm sorry I don't have that

1715
02:12:58,580 --> 02:12:59,640
That's unfortunate.

1716
02:12:59,840 --> 02:13:02,000
They couldn't get someone that sounded like Ryan Reynolds.

1717
02:13:03,140 --> 02:13:03,400
Yeah!

1718
02:13:04,160 --> 02:13:04,760
Right.

1719
02:13:05,940 --> 02:13:07,780
She's my rival.

1720
02:13:09,240 --> 02:13:10,560
Night at museum.

1721
02:13:11,320 --> 02:13:11,860
I don't know that.

1722
02:13:11,960 --> 02:13:13,680
Wait, is he wearing a fucking vest?

1723
02:13:14,900 --> 02:13:17,960
Please welcome actress, producer, and activist.

1724
02:13:18,260 --> 02:13:23,960
Also, like, also they leaked Deadpool and that other girl in
the update.

1725
02:13:24,540 --> 02:13:27,200
Like, they were like, oh, they leaked it out.

1726
02:13:28,120 --> 02:13:37,600

playing dr selena so no devs got in trouble there was no nta

1727
02:13:37,600 --> 02:13:49,000
breach guys some might say daring habit of crossing paths
with rather dashing antagonists and this one is undoubtedly

1728
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:54,480
unforgettable glennie thank you for the tier one stuff thank

02:13:54,480 --> 02:14:00,100
you i don't trust you and debbie They're like, dude, you're
a Deadpool.

1730
02:14:05,200 --> 02:14:06,920
I only get the OG skins.

1731
02:14:07,080 --> 02:14:08,740
I'm not really a fan of the Deadpool skin.

1732
02:14:13,800 --> 02:14:21,100
I am sometimes asked, Bovma, how is it that you hear every
whisper in every corner of Aleph?

1733
02:14:21,280 --> 02:14:21,760
Check Vlad?

1734
02:14:22,100 --> 02:14:28,100
My answer, I built Aleph with my will, my blood, my whole
self.

1735
02:14:30,060 --> 02:14:48,840
is an extension of my being my body today it became infected
oh shit oh not jack black yeah okay he sounded like jack

1736
02:14:48,840 --> 02:14:58,560
black there for a second oh hey it's a james bond name
please welcome he sounded like jack black for a little

1737
02:15:05,200 --> 02:15:13,040
Yeah, he got excited about, he got, Dad got excited about
Deadpool and Lenny Kravitz.

1738
02:15:14,020 --> 02:15:16,300
Bro, he looks just like him.

1739
02:15:19,220 --> 02:15:20,280
Good evening.

1740
02:15:21,720 --> 02:15:30,040
Was a great honor to be asked to join 007, first light from
my first voyage into the world of video games.

1741
02:15:30,060 --> 02:15:32,180
Who is this guy, by the way?

1742
02:15:33,720 --> 02:15:38,160
He's like, who is he?

1743
02:15:38,460 --> 02:15:43,440
A wild, unpredictable pirate ruler of Africa's greatest
black market hub.

1744
02:15:44,280 --> 02:15:45,980
I knew I was stepping into something special.

1745
02:15:46,380 --> 02:15:47,340
Oh, he's a musician.

1746
02:15:47,760 --> 02:15:48,420
We all see chaos.

1747
02:15:49,240 --> 02:15:50,100
Bubba sees freedom.

1748
02:15:51,180 --> 02:15:56,820
He rose from nothing, made free, and built his own kingdom
of Aleph.

1749
02:15:57,580 --> 02:15:58,880
And his story is just beginning.

1750
02:16:00,060 --> 02:16:06,300
Every world we build needs the power of rhythm through
music.

1751
02:16:07,460 --> 02:16:13,280
These musicians can turn violence into beauty and silence
into tension.

1752
02:16:13,680 --> 02:16:14,960
Also, how many songs?

1753
02:16:15,680 --> 02:16:18,400
Here are the nominees for Best Score and Music.

1754
02:16:18,860 --> 02:16:23,640
Okay, so we've only had like one performance for this.

1755
02:16:25,120 --> 02:16:32,660
You know, usually they do like everything, you know, every,
all the, the nominees get like a performance then it was

1756
02:16:32,660 --> 02:16:33,660
just one.

1757
02:16:36,080 --> 02:16:39,440
I expected like the other performances too.

1758
02:16:40,660 --> 02:16:41,600
Yeah, it's E3.

1759
02:16:47,020 --> 02:16:48,540
I think it's...

1760
02:16:48,540 --> 02:16:49,760
Welcome back, E3.

1761
02:16:50,960 --> 02:16:53,540
And the game award goes to...

1762
02:16:53,540 --> 02:16:54,420
Welcome back.

1763
02:16:54,500 --> 02:16:56,220
I didn't expect you to come back like this.

1764
02:16:56,460 --> 02:16:57,360
La Rian Testaro.

1765
02:17:13,080 --> 02:17:16,000
See, E3 eventually came back guys.

1766
02:17:23,140 --> 02:17:23,780
Thank you so much.

1767
02:17:25,400 --> 02:17:26,920
We are so happy to be here tonight.

1768
02:17:28,620 --> 02:17:33,080
It was incredible to play in the HTML in live with you.

1769
02:17:33,260 --> 02:17:34,540
It's incredible.

1770
02:17:34,840 --> 02:17:35,420
Thank you so much.

1771
02:17:35,700 --> 02:17:36,820
I might get that in here.

1772
02:17:37,040 --> 02:17:37,700
I have a letter.

1773
02:17:37,900 --> 02:17:39,000
I would love to read.

1774
02:17:42,460 --> 02:17:43,500
So we,

1775
02:17:49,450 --> 02:17:56,890
I would really love to start by thinking all the musicians
who work on the soundtrack with us, who give their soul and

1776
02:17:56,890 --> 02:18:00,170
their hand and their voice to the sound of the music.

1777
02:18:02,030 --> 02:18:05,610
I also want to thank you, Alice, to standing by my side.

1778
02:18:05,730 --> 02:18:06,530
All right, he's on my lap.

1779
02:18:06,670 --> 02:18:09,790
Say it's because I'm not playing game.

1780
02:18:09,910 --> 02:18:10,850
Anyone just watching?

1781
02:18:11,550 --> 02:18:12,290
So it's five.

1782
02:18:12,590 --> 02:18:15,750
Thank you for having each note through within you.

1783
02:18:15,990 --> 02:18:25,070
and for letting Alicia's voice is that's here now I can
bring him here thank you, Guillaume never mind

02:18:57,050 --> 02:18:59,210
You can almost see the screen, yeah.

1789
02:18:59,590 --> 02:19:00,690
Can you see that?

1790
02:19:01,250 --> 02:19:02,290
Can you see it?

1791
02:19:03,250 --> 02:19:04,450
Thank you.

1792
02:19:04,950 --> 02:19:05,950
To the untreated tomorrow.

02:19:06,750 --> 02:19:09,670
Oh, I thought you said translate that in French too.

1794
02:19:16,340 --> 02:19:18,320

1802
02:20:31,880 --> 02:20:32,980
is Warframe at?

1803
02:20:33,100 --> 02:20:34,480
No, that's an inside joke for Warframe.

1804
02:20:34,820 --> 02:20:35,440
Twitch chat, Megan.

1805
02:20:35,660 --> 02:20:35,840
All right.

1806
02:20:35,920 --> 02:20:36,520
Hi, Twitch chat.

1807
02:20:36,640 --> 02:20:37,360
Hi, Game Awards.

1808
02:20:37,700 --> 02:20:38,760
We're here for Warframe.

1809
02:20:39,380 --> 02:20:44,040
We launched our biggest update of the year, the old piece,
just yesterday.

1810
02:20:44,420 --> 02:20:47,080
And all things considered, the update went smooth.

1811
02:20:47,220 --> 02:20:52,580
So we're not here to finally announce that we're coming out
of open beta 12 years later.

1812
02:20:52,880 --> 02:20:54,860
No, we're still in beta, 12 years.

1813
02:20:54,960 --> 02:20:56,160
They're still in beta?

1814
02:20:56,400 --> 02:20:57,160
In those 12 years.

1815
02:20:57,360 --> 02:20:59,460
Bro, time off is out.

1816
02:21:04,700 --> 02:21:08,740
Bro, this dark cop has an ending now.

1817
02:21:08,860 --> 02:21:14,120
I know in Warframe and now Envoys with Soulframe and we
truly wouldn't be here without them.

1818
02:21:14,480 --> 02:21:16,320
So Reb, why are we actually here?

1819
02:21:16,620 --> 02:21:20,960
We are here to outsource the question of what is Warframe.

1820
02:21:21,400 --> 02:21:23,720
We have completely given up answering it ourselves.

1821
02:21:24,280 --> 02:21:26,620
Warframe was once ninjas in space, which it still is.

1822
02:21:26,620 --> 02:21:27,660
It's a running joke.

1823
02:21:28,020 --> 02:21:31,120
And we climb to the tagline, 12 years.

1824
02:21:31,360 --> 02:21:36,100
It's time to let a legend tell you what is Warframe.

1825
02:21:36,180 --> 02:21:38,400
Namus, thank you for gifting us up.

1826
02:21:38,680 --> 02:21:39,880
Thank you, thank you.

1827
02:21:40,120 --> 02:21:40,680
Potato.

1828
02:21:42,660 --> 02:21:44,440
What is Warframe?

1829
02:21:45,780 --> 02:21:46,740
Yeah, what is Warframe?

1830
02:21:47,720 --> 02:21:49,060
I've never played Warframe before.

1831
02:21:50,440 --> 02:21:51,440
Is it like Destiny?

1832
02:21:53,360 --> 02:21:56,280
Oh, I might have said, I might have triggered some Warframe
people.

1833
02:21:56,460 --> 02:21:58,580
I'm sorry, I don't, I've never played Warframe before.

1834
02:21:58,920 --> 02:22:00,000
Guys, I might be...

1835
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:01,980
I'm not rage baiting, I swear.

1836
02:22:05,080 --> 02:22:06,420
Don't keep it.

1837
02:22:07,560 --> 02:22:11,180
I swear to God, it's not rage bait.

1838
02:22:16,860 --> 02:22:21,240
I know, like, destiny and warframe players hate each other.

1839
02:22:22,300 --> 02:22:23,340
What drives them?

1840
02:22:24,420 --> 02:22:28,900
Their residual instinct or some separate conscious force?

1841
02:22:28,920 --> 02:22:42,600
force we may not know but there's one who does they hear her
voice a blanket against the horror they insist blindly upon

1842
02:22:42,600 --> 02:22:52,240
humanity and its worth even in the face of ultimate
indifference But with so little understanding of what they

1843
02:22:52,240 --> 02:22:52,360
have.

1844
02:22:52,700 --> 02:22:53,180
It's fine.

1845
02:22:53,360 --> 02:22:54,160
I hate them.

1846
02:22:56,140 --> 02:22:56,740
To me.

1847
02:23:03,500 --> 02:23:04,020
Tenno.

1848
02:23:05,220 --> 02:23:05,940
Wake up.

1849
02:23:09,890 --> 02:23:11,590
Oh, it's Destiny of It's Free.

1850
02:23:12,150 --> 02:23:12,950
That's Warframe.

1851
02:23:14,810 --> 02:23:17,870
Wait, people still talk about this series?

1852
02:23:18,370 --> 02:23:20,430
However, the book of stars.

1853
02:23:20,770 --> 02:23:22,230
Didn't they like, what was this?

1854
02:23:22,390 --> 02:23:23,730
The Seven Deadly Sins, right?

1855
02:23:23,910 --> 02:23:25,010
Didn't they fuck up?

1856
02:23:25,830 --> 02:23:26,550
Of the anime?

1857
02:23:26,610 --> 02:23:26,850
Of the anime?

1858
02:23:33,900 --> 02:23:34,620
Yeah.

1859
02:23:39,300 --> 02:23:41,360
I really like fell off super hard.

1860
02:23:42,840 --> 02:23:45,620
Now, a new destiny calls to us.

1861
02:23:46,400 --> 02:23:48,880
For the new tale we are about to create.

1862
02:23:49,600 --> 02:23:51,140
This reminds me of...

1863
02:23:51,140 --> 02:23:51,860
Together we run.

1864
02:23:52,740 --> 02:23:53,940
Bound by destiny.

1865
02:23:55,540 --> 02:23:57,280
The style reminds me of level 7.

1866
02:23:58,560 --> 02:24:01,620
A co-op open world RPG for everyone.

1867
02:24:01,720 --> 02:24:04,200
the seven deadly sins origin

1868
02:24:15,520 --> 02:24:25,180

even more Harry Potter fun coming later this month guys guys

1873
02:25:22,680 --> 02:25:36,000

important the monkey frog girl it's the world we live in

1874
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:44,000
guys all right back in 2023 Lawrence of the Fallen surprise
surprise real combat dark fantasy world building and

1875
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:49,480
stunning dual realm design Tonight, we have your first ever
look at the gameplay of the sequel.

1876
02:25:49,960 --> 02:25:51,200
They brought back boobs.

1877
02:25:51,520 --> 02:25:53,900
They brought back boobs in Fortnite, guys.

1878
02:25:54,700 --> 02:26:00,000
Apparently, like, I didn't know this, but in Fortnite, they
had to censor all the boobs when it got more and more

1879
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:01,180
popular with the kids.

1880
02:26:01,340 --> 02:26:04,220
So they, like, redesigned a lot of the skins that showed
boobs.

1881
02:26:04,900 --> 02:26:12,040
Because Kim Kardashian is now the first only official skin
where it shows boobs, where it shows cleavage.

1882
02:26:13,300 --> 02:26:13,520
Oh.

1883
02:26:14,540 --> 02:26:15,060
What?

1884
02:26:15,520 --> 02:26:17,700
Where's my...

1885
02:26:17,700 --> 02:26:18,240
Hello?

1886
02:26:19,280 --> 02:26:20,500
Where'd my stream go?

1887
02:26:20,560 --> 02:26:22,740
Oh, there we go.

1888
02:26:25,520 --> 02:26:29,040
A baby in a donkey.

1889
02:26:31,260 --> 02:26:33,840
No matter the cost.

1890
02:26:41,540 --> 02:26:43,780
What happened to the music?

1891
02:26:48,910 --> 02:26:51,650
The music is a little weird, isn't it, right?

1892
02:27:02,420 --> 02:27:04,100
What the fuck?

1893
02:27:11,960 --> 02:27:13,000
Forgive me.

1894
02:27:13,500 --> 02:27:16,260
Yeah, but her talking isn't fucking buffered.

1895
02:27:22,510 --> 02:27:26,590
Lords of the Fallen, version 2.5, with new veteran mode out
today.

1896
02:27:27,130 --> 02:27:29,350
No, I think it's like to be like not caught.

1897
02:27:29,570 --> 02:27:33,610
This next set of awards recognizes diverse set of games
across a variety of genres.

1898
02:27:34,170 --> 02:27:37,670
I think it was Twitch being like, okay, we don't want to get
striked by music producers.

1899
02:27:37,930 --> 02:27:42,490
So they like, they like tuned out to, they like retuned it

Guys, but imagine all the free currency you can get in
withering waves now.

1911
02:29:32,390 --> 02:29:32,910
Imagine.

1912
02:29:34,030 --> 02:29:37,690
For the last 30 years, the housemark name has been
synonymous with ring action.

1913
02:29:37,690 --> 02:29:39,070
They need those rolls.

1914
02:29:39,830 --> 02:29:41,290
Of course, bullet hell.

1915
02:29:41,990 --> 02:29:44,250
It's been an honor working with them, not just as an actor.

1916
02:29:44,270 --> 02:29:49,650
but as a fan of Stardust, Returnal, imagine all the polls
they can get now.

1917
02:29:50,270 --> 02:29:52,310
Fuel to play when Sarus lands next year.

1918
02:29:53,130 --> 02:29:55,550
And here's the debut of our new story trailer.

1919
02:29:56,510 --> 02:29:57,510
How do I get rid of this?

1920
02:29:57,890 --> 02:30:01,830
Now it's fucking bullying me about the fucking co-streaming
thing.

1921
02:30:04,190 --> 02:30:05,930
I don't want to co-stream.

1922
02:30:06,070 --> 02:30:07,210
I just don't know how.

1923
02:30:14,780 --> 02:30:16,360
Why, person, they even tier one sub.

1924
02:30:16,420 --> 02:30:16,760

gonna have to listen to this but it still shows up it's

1927
02:30:30,120 --> 02:30:42,260
trying to tell me to co-stream since the last time the sun
died mate he's telling me it's like we've left a fear we've

1928
02:30:42,260 --> 02:30:45,300
lost people there's there's no way to get home

1929
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:52,440
It gets in our heads And it twists Is Returnal?

1930
02:30:52,540 --> 02:31:02,600
I mean, it looks like it Yeah, it is It's Returnal I will
not Learn the code stream

1931
02:31:06,330 --> 02:31:12,590
This Returnal is basically Returnal is actually really fun I
just wish it wasn't If it wasn't like a PlayStation 5

1932
02:31:12,590 --> 02:31:18,870
exclusive I think this game would have been more popular
It's just unfortunate It was a PS5 exclusive That like

1933
02:31:18,870 --> 02:31:22,950
basically Oh That basically like killed the hype

1934
02:31:26,330 --> 02:31:38,370
Oh, it's not returner No returner is now on PC, but yeah,
what I meant like if it started as a If it started on PC it

1935
02:31:38,370 --> 02:31:49,530
would have been more hype That's what I'm trying to say
Grand Theft Auto 3, 4, 5 Oh San Andreas Red Dead Redemption

1936
02:31:49,530 --> 02:31:57,130
Look at that trailer co-founder of Rockstar Games and now
the founder of a new studio, Absurd Ventures, where he is

1937
02:31:57,130 --> 02:32:03,650
busy writing and creating novels, comic books, animated
series, and yes, two big upcoming unannounced open-world

1938
02:32:03,650 --> 02:32:04,090
games.

1939
02:32:04,450 --> 02:32:09,870
It is my honor to welcome you to the stage for the first
time an industry icon, Dan Houser.

1940
02:32:10,750 --> 02:32:12,630
Oh my God, Dan Houser!

1941
02:32:17,280 --> 02:32:18,920
Oh, I can co-stream it!

1942
02:32:19,460 --> 02:32:20,700
Guys, I'm going to co-stream.

1943
02:32:22,200 --> 02:32:23,780
Give me a sec, wait, wait, wait.

1944
02:32:24,160 --> 02:32:25,700
Wait, okay, this is gonna be a bit scabbed.

1945
02:32:25,860 --> 02:32:26,720
I'm gonna do it.

1946
02:32:29,540 --> 02:32:30,760
I did it!

1947
02:32:30,820 --> 02:32:31,240
Good evening.

1948
02:32:31,660 --> 02:32:33,400
I'm co-streaming!

1949
02:32:34,780 --> 02:32:37,080
You guys don't have figured it out?

1950
02:32:37,220 --> 02:32:38,200
I'll show you guys.

1951
02:32:40,540 --> 02:32:46,560
More than any other medium, video games have the power to
take the audience on a journey both physically and

1952
02:32:46,560 --> 02:32:46,980
emotionally.

1953
02:32:48,080 --> 02:32:50,360
Games don't just tell us a story and let us live it.

1954
02:32:50,880 --> 02:32:57,920
The story becomes the experience driven and shared by the
player's choices it's a level of shared authorship that's

1955
02:32:57,920 --> 02:33:07,880
unique i bet it was a single button it wasn't a turkey and
so here are the nominees for best narrative best narrative i

1956
02:33:07,880 --> 02:33:23,000
said it guys i learned how this ghost dream it was a mistake
i will find every last number of the years it wasn't there

1957
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:26,160
before every Russian has showed up.

1958
02:33:29,960 --> 02:33:32,500
Guys, I'm part of the crew now.

1959
02:33:35,920 --> 02:33:38,580
I'm part of the cool kids group.

1960
02:33:39,640 --> 02:33:40,320
E33.

1961
02:33:47,100 --> 02:33:50,940
Gojumbo's like, just, gojumbo's just like, bro.

1962
02:33:52,660 --> 02:33:55,600
I gotta get these guys in the studio to sign my board.

1963
02:33:58,500 --> 02:34:06,560
He's gonna get Charlie Cox in the studio now And what's her
name the the girl who played mad

1964
02:34:12,280 --> 02:34:17,860
But Jumbo's gonna get Charlie Cox and the that girl in the
studio now

1965
02:34:25,010 --> 02:34:27,890
They're stacking the discount codes

1966
02:34:31,890 --> 02:34:38,790
Guys Thank you to our Oh my god, the discount code for the
next trailer for next year is going to be so cheap for them.

1967
02:34:40,490 --> 02:34:43,450
In games, a story is a shared creation.

1968
02:34:44,290 --> 02:34:50,330
It starts with words on a page, but the player experiences
it through the work of each of our teams.

1969
02:34:51,150 --> 02:34:53,750
What the fuck is the XQC snooze?

1970
02:34:54,030 --> 02:34:55,130
Oh, it's because they're sweeping.

1971
02:34:55,550 --> 02:34:59,070
I like how that theme of that's flying onto my screen.

1972
02:34:59,310 --> 02:35:01,390
And through localization into other languages.

1973
02:35:01,990 --> 02:35:04,190
All of that is supported by our producing.

1974
02:35:04,210 --> 02:35:05,870
and our technical teams.

1975
02:35:06,490 --> 02:35:14,790
The last ingredient is our players who interpret the story
in the context of their own lives and who keep our story

1976
02:35:14,790 --> 02:35:18,750
alive through their own creative expression and discussions.

1977
02:35:19,510 --> 02:35:27,070
The marvelous thing about games is that we create that
experience together, our team with our players.

1978
02:35:27,750 --> 02:35:28,670
Thank you so much.

1979
02:35:30,350 --> 02:35:30,590
Yeah!

1980
02:35:44,810 --> 02:35:58,070
what the fuck why did he bring the picture book oh wait it's
like the the thing that says his name i was like why is

1981
02:35:58,070 --> 02:36:06,150

anyone but everyone wants a piece no law i'm gonna say it no

1984
02:36:28,890 --> 02:36:38,330
oversight just the jungle creepy a lot of not a lot of very
hype game announcements this year the mayor i will say it

1985
02:36:39,150 --> 02:36:46,370
said the city needed order and they'd be the ones to bring
it it's on their turn for you you.

1986
02:36:51,600 --> 02:36:53,500
Dirt instead of blood.

1987
02:36:54,600 --> 02:36:56,880
But desire is a fickle mistress.

1988
02:36:58,340 --> 02:37:00,880
The city won't let me go.

1989
02:37:01,820 --> 02:37:04,120
It won't forget my name.

1990
02:37:04,920 --> 02:37:09,200
I asked for nothing, and they still came and took
everything.

1991
02:37:10,620 --> 02:37:15,580
The mares and anyone that stands in my way, every last one
of them.

1992
02:37:18,080 --> 02:37:29,080
They're gonna learn real simple what game is this this is an
abstraction shooter okay no it's just park it's just parkour

1993
02:37:44,050 --> 02:37:55,240

good morning to everyone in uh sweden and uh europe i know

Wait, but they already not won the music awards.

Oh, that's sad.

2003
02:38:57,020 --> 02:38:59,760
This is the first time anyone's ever seen clips of this
show.

2004
02:39:00,180 --> 02:39:00,680
Oh,

2005
02:39:11,550 --> 02:39:15,230
This is the most viewership this show has ever got.

2006
02:39:18,770 --> 02:39:20,450
Bye-bye, darling.

2007
02:39:28,950 --> 02:39:31,870
Yeah, it started so many cries.

2008
02:39:59,660 --> 02:40:00,220
Yeah,

2009
02:40:21,850 --> 02:40:25,350
I know the out-of-wake performance is like the best it'll
ever do.

2010
02:40:27,670 --> 02:40:30,330
I don't think there's any performance that can top that.

2011
02:40:57,610 --> 02:41:01,270
Just like a Sonic game, at least the music is good.

2012
02:41:01,650 --> 02:41:02,050
True!

2013
02:41:04,210 --> 02:41:07,710
Gameplay can be mediocre, but we can always count on the
music.

2014
02:41:10,230 --> 02:41:11,090
I don't know.

2015
02:41:12,430 --> 02:41:21,670
The anime did not deserve this soundtrack i think the entire
budget went to the fucking music at this point

2016
02:41:41,280 --> 02:41:51,740
whoa you go girl you guys know blizzcon is back brought
blizzcon back

2017
02:41:58,090 --> 02:41:58,690
Yeah.

2018
02:42:02,130 --> 02:42:02,570
Yeah.

2019
02:42:04,870 --> 02:42:05,470
Why?

2020
02:42:06,910 --> 02:42:13,070
No, I'm like thinking like, they don't really have a lot of
games anymore that people talk about.

2021
02:42:22,750 --> 02:42:23,910
So good.

2022
02:42:24,110 --> 02:42:25,150
Talk about a performance.

2023
02:42:25,370 --> 02:42:26,670
Devil May Cry season two.

2024
02:42:26,690 --> 02:42:28,850
Like no one really plays Herbstone anymore.

2025
02:42:28,970 --> 02:42:31,850
Everybody's doing team fight tactics.

2026
02:42:34,210 --> 02:42:40,450
I guess the only game that's sort of alive is Overwatch.

2027
02:42:44,770 --> 02:42:45,270
And...

2028
02:42:45,270 --> 02:42:47,550
I guess Diablo?

2029
02:42:47,730 --> 02:42:49,750
The Game Awards Orchestra are tuning up.

2030
02:42:50,890 --> 02:42:51,470
Oh, wow.

2031
02:42:51,710 --> 02:42:54,190
Okay, I forgot about World of Warcraft for some reason.

2032
02:42:55,230 --> 02:42:56,050
I think it says MM...

2033
02:42:56,050 --> 02:42:59,310
I think like MMOs are now so like...

2034
02:43:00,630 --> 02:43:02,830
Not, you know, it's not as popular.

2035
02:43:03,590 --> 02:43:04,130
anymore.

2036
02:43:11,900 --> 02:43:12,650
Oh, is that the...

2037
02:43:13,680 --> 02:43:14,820
What is it called?

2038
02:43:16,440 --> 02:43:17,520
We're moon mates?

2039
02:43:17,660 --> 02:43:17,900
Yeah.

2040
02:43:19,240 --> 02:43:21,480
People were saying it's crazy that this game is free.

2041
02:43:23,240 --> 02:43:25,580
Because of like the quality of gameplay.

2042
02:43:30,440 --> 02:43:34,820
Yeah, apparently the gotcha is only for the clothes, for the
outfits.

2043
02:43:34,940 --> 02:43:36,860
Like it's just cosmetics for the gotcha.

2044
02:43:37,480 --> 02:43:38,680
Everything else is free.

2045
02:43:40,740 --> 02:43:43,080
Yeah, people are like, it's way too good to be free.

2046
02:43:44,920 --> 02:43:46,380
I've heard about it.

2047
02:43:48,200 --> 02:43:53,080
Literally just got, like, cosmetics are the only thing
that's paid.

2048
02:43:54,380 --> 02:43:55,940
Oh, where win meets.

2049
02:44:00,020 --> 02:44:02,540
Yeah, the cosmetics are apparently really expensive.

2050
02:44:09,580 --> 02:44:10,720
Is this Phasmophobia?

2051
02:44:19,740 --> 02:44:22,000
Oh, why does it look so different?

2052
02:44:24,640 --> 02:44:27,780
Why does that look different than the PC version?

2053
02:44:28,120 --> 02:44:29,580
They'll want to play other games they love too.

2054
02:44:29,960 --> 02:44:32,340
So you'll build them a place to discover more cool games.

2055
02:44:32,920 --> 02:44:33,380
More than that.

2056
02:44:34,040 --> 02:44:34,360
Perfect.

2057
02:44:35,040 --> 02:44:37,200
But then they want to play those games anywhere and
everything.

2058
02:44:37,200 --> 02:44:39,780
Yeah, that did not look like the same game.

2059
02:44:41,140 --> 02:44:43,940
Yeah, was there a big fucking update or something?

2060
02:44:44,560 --> 02:44:46,680
And everything else they love in one place.

2061
02:44:47,180 --> 02:44:52,740
So you'll give them a U-Tap, a home base that tracks all
their play, no matter how they play, with one souped up

2062
02:44:52,740 --> 02:44:54,140
profile to rule them all.

2063
02:44:57,080 --> 02:45:01,340
Also, I saw some here were mentioning about AI dialogue.

2064
02:45:01,860 --> 02:45:07,280
I think a lot of people forget that our creators also use AI
dialogue as well.

2065
02:45:07,280 --> 02:45:07,700
47.

2066
02:45:08,620 --> 02:45:10,780
An urgent threat has emerged in Dartmoor.

2067
02:45:12,900 --> 02:45:16,540
One that can have catastrophic consequences on a global
scale.

2068
02:45:19,680 --> 02:45:21,620
We don't forget.

2069
02:45:25,360 --> 02:45:32,320
Please welcome the actress behind Hitman's next elusive
target, Mila Yovavitch.

2070
02:45:39,370 --> 02:45:41,850
Yeah, at least, yeah, the voice actors get paid at least,
yeah.

2071
02:45:43,530 --> 02:45:45,110
It's like how, what's his name?

2072
02:45:45,430 --> 02:45:50,270
It's like how Darth Vader, the voice of Darth Vader sold his
soul and voice to Disney.

2073
02:45:50,850 --> 02:45:52,270
And then we had, we had...

2074
02:45:53,170 --> 02:45:57,870
And then we had Darth Vader in Fortnite being very, very
racist.

2075
02:45:58,890 --> 02:46:06,510
as the next elusive target in yeah uh the guy the voice
actor for darf ador sold his voice to disney and now it's

2076
02:46:06,510 --> 02:46:15,870
used for ai the hunt he's dead by the way that's like i
think that was like the worst part he's dead and he sold his

2077
02:46:15,870 --> 02:46:23,570
voice to disney modern multiplayer represents a monstrous
challenge in game or his family sold his voice that's sadder

2078
02:46:23,570 --> 02:46:32,290
that's even more sad that account for the of thousands of
live opponents?

2079
02:46:33,430 --> 02:46:37,790
Or even worse, the persistent dumbness of a human teammate?

2080
02:46:39,610 --> 02:46:40,650
It's no easy task.

2081
02:46:41,470 --> 02:46:46,130
And tonight's nominees all pull it off in their own
inspiring way.

2082
02:46:46,550 --> 02:46:47,290
Here they are.

2083
02:46:48,630 --> 02:46:50,230
Best multiplayer game.

2084
02:46:50,670 --> 02:46:52,450
They said the world above had ended.

2085
02:46:52,770 --> 02:46:54,590
Wait, who's the award presenter?

2086
02:46:55,370 --> 02:46:57,910

2120
02:49:38,820 --> 02:49:50,980
For 25 years, creative assembly has entertained millions of
people all around the world with the Total War franchise.

2121
02:49:51,200 --> 02:49:51,860
Oh my god.

2122
02:49:51,900 --> 02:49:57,800
Today, I'm here to help announce where Total War is going
next.

2123
02:49:58,100 --> 02:50:05,260
And it'll be in a universe that is so close.

2124
02:50:05,560 --> 02:50:07,220
Oh, one of the hell boys.

2125
02:50:08,280 --> 02:50:16,840
I'm excited to reveal that Total War is headed to the grim
dark future.

2126

2127
02:50:21,560 --> 02:50:25,480
Warhammer 40K.

2128
02:50:28,320 --> 02:50:29,360
Captain Russia.

2129
02:50:31,600 --> 02:50:36,500
Some of you may know this, but some of you may not know
this, but I am a huge fan of tabletop gaming.

2130
02:50:36,720 --> 02:50:44,280
I've painted endless miniatures, spent a crazy amount of
time dropping dice under a table.

2131
02:50:45,920 --> 02:50:50,120
Of course, as you might expect, I'll be in the game.

2132
02:50:50,620 --> 02:50:51,080
Whoa.

2133
02:50:52,580 --> 02:50:53,780
It'll be in the game.

2134
02:50:54,720 --> 02:50:58,080
It connects to some of my favorite aspects.

2135
02:50:58,100 --> 02:50:59,860
of the universe.

2136
02:51:00,100 --> 02:51:01,120
Quite expensive, huh?

2137
02:51:01,220 --> 02:51:03,300
Bro, that guy is a movie actor.

2138
02:51:03,600 --> 02:51:04,040
He has...

2139
02:51:04,040 --> 02:51:06,640
Let's take a first look at Total War.

2140
02:51:07,200 --> 02:51:07,540
Warhammer.

2141
02:51:07,560 --> 02:51:08,640
He has the money.

2142
02:51:11,440 --> 02:51:14,720
That guy was in the New Avengers.

2143
02:51:18,520 --> 02:51:20,600
He has minifigures money.

2144
02:51:34,700 --> 02:51:35,460
Brothers!

2145
02:51:37,380 --> 02:51:38,140
Brothers!

2146
02:51:45,550 --> 02:51:49,970
Literally the only thing I know about the Warhammer series.

2147
02:51:51,550 --> 02:51:53,550
That and Flash Kids.

2148
02:51:54,210 --> 02:51:59,830
Thank you for everything I learned about Warhammer is from
Flash Kids.

2149
02:52:00,370 --> 02:52:01,250
Brothers.

2150
02:52:10,250 --> 02:52:15,130
Across countless worlds, battles rage.

2151
02:52:18,410 --> 02:52:21,450
How dare you say that, but the Emperor?

2152
02:52:28,720 --> 02:52:32,060
Look, they're just trying to keep their bloodline clear.

2153
02:52:34,780 --> 02:52:37,860
From the goddamn aliens.

2154
02:52:45,540 --> 02:52:46,560
For the Emperor.

2155
02:52:55,480 --> 02:52:57,560
They don't have a bloodline.

2156
02:52:57,720 --> 02:52:58,280
They're close.

2157
02:52:58,560 --> 02:53:00,860
That makes their bloodline extra close.

2158
02:53:00,880 --> 02:53:06,640
If they keep cloning themselves, there won't be any.

2159
02:53:33,300 --> 02:53:34,720
Oh, what?

2160
02:53:35,560 --> 02:53:37,820
Wait, is this a RTS?

2161
02:53:41,140 --> 02:53:45,160
Wait, this is a real-time strategy game.

2162
02:53:49,130 --> 02:53:50,490
It's total war.

2163
02:53:52,670 --> 02:53:54,430
There's no peace among us.

2164
02:53:54,450 --> 02:53:58,070

02:54:02,990 --> 02:54:12,210

2168
02:54:34,650 --> 02:54:36,490
The last lands of the FCU.

2169
02:54:37,210 --> 02:54:39,470
The Federation of Central Yusha.

2170
02:54:41,810 --> 02:54:41,910

02:54:45,690 --> 02:54:47,390
Hello there, my dear newcomer.

2173
02:54:47,690 --> 02:54:49,210
You are very lucky, you know.

Don't worry at all.

2176
02:54:53,870 --> 02:54:54,810
Oh my god, is this Top Gun?

2177
02:54:56,370 --> 02:54:58,010
I never watched Top Gun.

2178
02:54:58,130 --> 02:55:05,050
The only thing I know about Top Gun is from family guy
because they keep referencing top gun and i watch family guy

2179
02:55:05,050 --> 02:55:21,290
unironically okay i guess i'll never know it's just 2 hd

2181
02:55:30,840 --> 02:55:33,620
To keep up alive, Wings of Thief must stay on the mission.

2182
02:55:33,860 --> 02:55:34,760
Must fly on.

2183
02:55:34,940 --> 02:55:38,250
I can make up your killer.

2184
02:55:38,730 --> 02:55:39,090
Fine.

2185
02:55:39,590 --> 02:55:42,450
From now on, you'll be the greatest ace pilot this war will
ever be.

2186
02:55:43,070 --> 02:55:44,130
Oh my god.

2187
02:55:44,370 --> 02:55:46,350
Like, uh, Ace Combat?

2188
02:55:50,470 --> 02:55:52,250
Wings of Thief.

2189
02:55:52,770 --> 02:55:54,290
Never played Ace Combat before.

2190
02:55:57,390 --> 02:56:00,090
Oh, there's a lot of passionate Ace Combat fans there.

2191
02:56:00,330 --> 02:56:01,070
Yes, that's right.

2192
02:56:01,170 --> 02:56:03,050
Ace Combat is back in 20...

2193
02:56:03,070 --> 02:56:16,270
add the sound effects of people clapping there was no one
clapping in the audience guys i did not see anyone clapping

2194
02:56:16,270 --> 02:56:31,330
i was clapping it was just one person clapping some of the
key folks behind burnout and need for it was off camera

2195
02:56:31,330 --> 02:56:37,490
experiencing experience I think they actually inputted a
sound effect.

2196
02:56:37,630 --> 02:56:40,170
I did not see anyone in the audience clapping there.

2197
02:56:47,270 --> 02:56:49,150
Is this pod racing?

2198
02:56:49,590 --> 02:56:51,310
Wait, this is pod racing.

2199
02:56:53,210 --> 02:56:55,150
Now this is pod racing.

2200
02:56:56,890 --> 02:56:57,250
Yeah, I remember.

2201
02:57:11,280 --> 02:57:12,540
Recognize the pods.

2202
02:57:23,240 --> 02:57:23,800
Unskilled.

2203
02:57:24,080 --> 02:57:25,840
Thank you for the five gifted souls.

2204
02:57:26,080 --> 02:57:26,260
Thank you.

2205
02:57:26,560 --> 02:57:26,860
Thank you.

2206
02:57:27,140 --> 02:57:28,680
Thank you for the Twitch Prime.

2207
02:57:28,900 --> 02:57:29,660
Thank you.

02:57:29,820 --> 02:57:31,200
I really appreciate it.

2209
02:57:33,880 --> 02:57:34,580
Oh my god.

2210
02:57:34,700 --> 02:57:35,060
Wait.

2211
02:57:35,480 --> 02:57:37,060
Did that guy just shot him?

2212
02:57:43,600 --> 02:57:44,440
Holy shit.

2213
02:57:44,520 --> 02:57:45,400
This looks intense.

2214
02:57:47,700 --> 02:57:50,180
I do not think this is gameplay trailer though.

2215
02:57:56,670 --> 02:58:08,230
Galactic Racer Oh hey it's that guy I'm curious how the
gameplay trailer is gonna look though What the fuck is it

2216
02:58:08,230 --> 02:58:09,910
buffering a lot today

2217
02:58:19,560 --> 02:58:24,860
Oh I remember I saw the trailer for this What were your
names again?

2218
02:58:26,380 --> 02:58:42,060
I remember this They literally made this entire game out of
stock motion which is crazy yeah that's a lot of effort it's

2219
02:58:42,060 --> 02:58:49,760
a feeling it's a feeling of destiny follow me apparently
stop motion is cheaper than 3d animation but it's i feel

2220
02:58:49,760 --> 02:58:58,100
like i don't know it's crazy because i feel like the effort
of stop motion is a lot more i'm gonna have to refresh this

2221
02:58:58,100 --> 02:59:09,320
though because the music's fucked up again yeah it's
definitely more labor intensive I remember I saw a trailer

2222
02:59:09,320 --> 02:59:18,760
for this such a beautiful game that was out of words a stop
motion co-op game being developed it's another day it takes

2223
02:59:18,760 --> 02:59:26,100

Who knows?

2240
03:00:26,800 --> 03:00:27,900
Maybe it'll all work out.

2241
03:00:28,580 --> 03:00:30,520
How about something like this?

A two, three.

2273
03:01:57,820 --> 03:01:59,480
So when I'm Prince's Beach, wearing Christmas boots.

2276
03:02:26,980 --> 03:02:27,860

2280
03:02:37,540 --> 03:02:41,960
Alright, the Gamer Wars will be right back after this new
look at Do It Night Abyss.

2281
03:02:42,100 --> 03:02:44,220
The Gamer Wars always lets me down.

2282
03:02:45,720 --> 03:02:47,140
I can't believe it.

2283
03:02:47,220 --> 03:02:51,380
It's from that song that I learned the existence of other
games.

2284
03:02:52,160 --> 03:02:57,300
I thought it was... I swear to God, I thought there was only
one game that was released this year.

2285
03:02:57,660 --> 03:02:59,600
And it was Claire E33.

2286
03:03:04,390 --> 03:03:06,430
You could have fooling me.

2287
03:03:12,450 --> 03:03:19,090
The 33 in the game name stands for how many awards is gonna
win in the game awards.

2288
03:03:21,130 --> 03:03:23,450
Bro, they just have to drop a DLC next year.

2289
03:03:24,050 --> 03:03:28,870
The moment they drop a DLC in 2026, then they can sweep that
one too.

2290
03:03:30,270 --> 03:03:31,030
I know I'm buff.

2291
03:03:31,270 --> 03:03:32,550
Why is buffering a lot?

2292
03:03:34,050 --> 03:03:37,950
Maybe I'll just, I could lower the quality a little bit
more, maybe.

2293
03:03:39,250 --> 03:03:41,070
No, I don't want to watch in 720.

2294
03:03:42,150 --> 03:03:43,570
I have fiber!

2295
03:03:45,990 --> 03:03:48,410
It shouldn't be buffering.

2296
03:03:48,950 --> 03:03:51,230
I think it's because so many people are watching it.

2297
03:03:51,950 --> 03:03:57,870
I don't think Twitch was anticipating how many people were
watching the Game Rewards this year.

2298
03:04:00,550 --> 03:04:01,690
Yeah, I'm refreshing.

2299
03:04:05,130 --> 03:04:07,810
Yeah, I think it's just the server is getting hammered.

2300
03:04:08,390 --> 03:04:18,110
I'm refreshing it guys because it started doing the thingy
where the music is oh hey AMD I

2301
03:04:21,970 --> 03:04:31,130
think I remembered oh yeah we went on YouTube guys remember
we went on YouTube last year because twitch kept buffering I

2302
03:04:31,130 --> 03:04:40,570
remember now yeah I think it's just twitch things but like
now we're buffering later

2303
03:04:44,690 --> 03:04:52,010
I forgot about that Yeah, I was one of five people watching
from YouTube

2304
03:04:59,040 --> 03:05:00,680
This is Ark Knights

2305
03:05:06,920 --> 03:05:09,260
What is the best part?

2306
03:05:09,420 --> 03:05:19,220
I don't know, this year is like This is the longest game
This is the longest game award so far But I feel like least

2307
03:05:19,220 --> 03:05:21,220
amount of content this year.

2308
03:05:22,520 --> 03:05:27,200
Also, it doesn't help that one game is just sweeping
everything, so it's pretty boring.

2309
03:05:28,020 --> 03:05:29,840
I think that it's just too predictable.

2310
03:05:37,430 --> 03:05:41,690
I think my favorite was Moist Critical's reaction for
winning content creator of the year.

2311
03:05:42,250 --> 03:05:44,350
And all he said was, yep.

2312
03:05:50,340 --> 03:05:50,940
Yep.

2313
03:05:51,600 --> 03:05:52,340
Thanks, chat.

2314
03:05:56,540 --> 03:06:05,700
No, it's just we're so like, you know, when you know what's
gonna happen, there's no like tension or be like, oh guys,

2315
03:06:05,840 --> 03:06:06,660
who's gonna win this?

2316
03:06:06,740 --> 03:06:09,380
Like it's so predictable who's gonna win what?

2317
03:06:09,680 --> 03:06:14,920
So it's like, it's not, you're not even like, there's no,
like yeah, it's cool, they won, but like it's so

2318
03:06:14,920 --> 03:06:15,480
predictable.

2319
03:06:15,860 --> 03:06:18,900
There's no like variety of like what to expect.

2320
03:06:20,220 --> 03:06:21,280
There's just no competition.

2321
03:06:21,540 --> 03:06:28,960
It's like sports sometimes when one team just sweeps it all
in the end because it's just really boring because it's so

2322
03:06:28,960 --> 03:06:35,300
predictable the games aren't like super like intense or
anything that was the announcement of yeah there's no

2323
03:06:35,300 --> 03:06:43,280
suspense a new song with arc night endfield which arrives
january 22nd 2026 and then like a lot of the trailers that

2324
03:06:43,280 --> 03:06:50,820
dropped not there hasn't been game for i mean i think
there's like i think just the games only for you here at the

2325
03:06:50,820 --> 03:06:56,800
yeah i think it says like a lot of Also, games are not,
like, my type of genre that I like to play.

2326
03:06:57,220 --> 03:06:58,220
I think for other people...

2327
03:06:58,220 --> 03:06:59,100
Wait, is this...

2328
03:06:59,100 --> 03:07:00,240
Oh, never mind.

2329
03:07:01,280 --> 03:07:04,200
I was like, oh my god, is he wall-riding, like, Titanfall?

2330
03:07:04,340 --> 03:07:06,020
But then I'm like, that's funny.

2331
03:07:06,360 --> 03:07:06,820
Doki.

2332
03:07:11,780 --> 03:07:13,240
Titanfall is dead.

2333
03:07:13,860 --> 03:07:16,200
EA got bought by Saudi Arabia.

2334
03:07:20,740 --> 03:07:22,280
For one second.

2335
03:07:39,210 --> 03:07:39,610
Whoa.

2336
03:07:54,460 --> 03:08:00,080
But yeah, like, I think it says, like, a lot of games they
announce aren't, like, genres that I tend to play.

2337
03:08:00,660 --> 03:08:02,040
So I'm not like...

2338
03:08:02,040 --> 03:08:06,320
For me, it feels like a lot of the announcements have been,
like, lackluster.

2339
03:08:06,800 --> 03:08:08,720
Other than the First Republic, that one was...

2340
03:08:09,300 --> 03:08:10,200
That one was cool.

2341
03:08:10,420 --> 03:08:10,960
I like that.

2342
03:08:12,460 --> 03:08:13,780
All right, let's get on.

2343
03:08:15,300 --> 03:08:16,960
I'm gonna put...

2344
03:08:18,000 --> 03:08:19,080
Let Dad out.

2345
03:08:19,820 --> 03:08:20,260
Oh, never mind.

2346
03:08:20,460 --> 03:08:21,600
He's just sitting in the...

2347
03:08:21,600 --> 03:08:21,960
Never mind.

2348
03:08:22,100 --> 03:08:23,940
He's just sitting in his bed now.

2349
03:08:27,380 --> 03:08:30,160
There's always a last game trailer and the first one.

2350
03:08:30,320 --> 03:08:31,240
That's the most hype.

2351
03:08:32,640 --> 03:08:33,820
Or the Old Republic.

2352
03:08:41,610 --> 03:08:42,790
I mean, this one's cool.

2353
03:08:44,610 --> 03:08:46,070
Is this like... Is this Souls?

2354
03:08:46,950 --> 03:08:47,570
Is this a Souls?

2355
03:08:47,690 --> 03:08:51,180
I mean, it's not obvious it's not souls like i mean i meant
like is this souls like

2356
03:09:15,850 --> 03:09:26,680
hey surprise extraction shooter i imagine i imagine this was
an extraction shooter oh he wants to get out all right

2357
03:09:40,920 --> 03:09:48,720
that's open the door for him it's cool though that we're
seeing a lot of games based off of Chinese history and

2358
03:09:48,720 --> 03:09:49,200
folklore.

2359
03:09:49,660 --> 03:09:50,600
I like that, though.

2360
03:09:52,500 --> 03:09:53,520
I'm getting a lot of it.

2361
03:09:53,680 --> 03:09:54,420
Ever since Wukong.

2362
03:09:57,080 --> 03:09:59,020
Oh, he's using the drunken style.

2363
03:10:02,930 --> 03:10:03,550
Oh, no.

2364
03:10:03,610 --> 03:10:04,970
That's the lion dance.

2365
03:10:07,130 --> 03:10:11,470
A lot of people misconstrued the lion dance as dragons, but
they're lions.

2366
03:10:12,170 --> 03:10:13,610
And they like to eat cabbages.

2367
03:10:27,700 --> 03:10:28,740
Why cabbages?

2368
03:10:29,020 --> 03:10:29,760
I don't know.

2369
03:10:30,220 --> 03:10:32,400
I don't know about...

2370
03:10:35,140 --> 03:10:37,560
Sorry, someone in my comment.

2371
03:10:37,940 --> 03:10:38,120
Okay.

2372
03:10:40,580 --> 03:10:45,100
I'm not gonna read the comment out, but that was a funny
comment.

2373
03:10:50,240 --> 03:10:52,440
This is Phantom Blade.

2374
03:10:53,800 --> 03:10:56,020
I'm not gonna read it.

2375
03:10:56,680 --> 03:10:58,620
I don't know about white cabbages.

2376
03:11:00,220 --> 03:11:05,700
I cannot wait to play that on PlayStation and PC when it
comes out next September.

2377
03:11:06,180 --> 03:11:07,920
I was just not expecting that.

2378
03:11:08,060 --> 03:11:09,040
That was just out of nowhere.

2379
03:11:11,320 --> 03:11:17,340
From the Elder Scrolls to Fallout, his games have helped
define our industry and shape the way we explore digital

2380
03:11:17,340 --> 03:11:17,520
work.

2381
03:11:18,180 --> 03:11:22,260
Please welcome the studio head and creative director at
Bethesda Game Studios.

2382
03:11:22,360 --> 03:11:23,980
Don't believe his lies.

2383
03:11:25,040 --> 03:11:26,440
But he's real.

2384
03:11:28,040 --> 03:11:32,380
If someone told me that Todd Howard was AI, I'd believe
them.

2385
03:11:33,640 --> 03:11:36,660
He was AI created by the board.

2386
03:11:38,900 --> 03:11:40,920
Todd lied to me more.

2387
03:11:43,260 --> 03:11:43,680
True.

2388
03:11:44,520 --> 03:11:47,460
The development is the ultimate team sport.

2389
03:11:47,480 --> 03:11:48,720
Oh, me lies, Todd.

2390
03:11:49,000 --> 03:11:52,420
It doesn't matter if it's a team of 10 or a team of
hundreds.

2391
03:11:53,260 --> 03:12:04,040
Art, design, audio, engineering, and marketing, more have to
come together as one game direction is that glue and the

2392
03:12:04,040 --> 03:12:14,200
games that have had them all come together well they touch
us can't believe they made this hologram so real guys oh my

2393
03:12:14,200 --> 03:12:23,240
god this hologram is crazy real best game direction everyone
vanishes into nothingness

2394
03:12:29,630 --> 03:12:33,290
He's just like that student they meet you.

2395
03:12:38,270 --> 03:12:38,610
E33.

2396
03:12:47,780 --> 03:12:50,720
There's no way E33 doesn't win this.

2397
03:12:50,740 --> 03:12:53,240
And the game award goes to Expedition 33.

2398
03:12:58,120 --> 03:12:59,760
Oh, there they go again.

2399
03:13:02,080 --> 03:13:04,400
That guy looks like one of the college humor guys.

2400
03:13:04,840 --> 03:13:06,000
The tall one.

2401
03:13:08,520 --> 03:13:09,480
Who would have thought?

2402
03:13:09,960 --> 03:13:10,660
Who would have thought?

2403
03:13:13,180 --> 03:13:15,480
Say the whole name tag.

2404
03:13:17,260 --> 03:13:18,060
Hello again.

2405
03:13:19,740 --> 03:13:22,340
Yeah, this is a quite intimidating.

2406
03:13:22,960 --> 03:13:22,960
Wow.

2407
03:13:23,800 --> 03:13:24,560
Yeah, what?

2408
03:13:24,980 --> 03:13:25,640
Hello, hello.

2409
03:13:25,940 --> 03:13:26,920
Let's get to it.

2410
03:13:27,900 --> 03:13:30,820
Um, yeah, so back in- How many awards did they win?

2411
03:13:30,940 --> 03:13:33,560
I received the mail just anonymously.

2412
03:13:34,840 --> 03:13:41,120
uh just yeah make a game they said it would be fun they said
brevi thank you for the tier one something 33.

2413
03:13:42,560 --> 03:13:46,800
well well fast forward i've lost count they won 33.

2414
03:13:47,720 --> 03:13:50,960
if they won another one they have to change the name to 34.

2415
03:13:51,640 --> 03:13:59,120
so don't really understand but you know it's a timeline
however where we're eternally grateful for the support and

2416
03:13:59,120 --> 03:14:07,460
love we've received as well um all the was with us to
tonight and the ones abroad, friends and family who believed

2417
03:14:07,460 --> 03:14:08,900
in us and made this dream come true.

2418
03:14:10,020 --> 03:14:12,800
And yeah, I love to thank my wife as well.

2419
03:14:12,980 --> 03:14:16,340
She couldn't make it here tonight, but I think she's
watching it.

2420
03:14:17,020 --> 03:14:18,720
She's in Brazil, so time.

2421
03:14:18,860 --> 03:14:19,980
What's she doing in Brazil?

2422
03:14:20,300 --> 03:14:21,440
Quite huge.

2423
03:14:21,940 --> 03:14:23,280
Wait, does she live in Brazil?

2424
03:14:23,640 --> 03:14:25,120
Doki, they might live in Brazil.

2425
03:14:26,140 --> 03:14:27,760
I was like, what the fuck already?

2426
03:14:29,560 --> 03:14:32,140
I was like, you would think they would live in France.

2427
03:14:32,320 --> 03:14:33,000
I don't know.

2428
03:14:33,600 --> 03:14:34,800
It would become PSP.

2429
03:14:34,820 --> 03:14:36,020
Come to Brazil.

2430
03:14:42,810 --> 03:14:43,230
I don't know.

2431
03:14:43,290 --> 03:14:45,830
I just thought they would be like, they would live in
France.

2432
03:14:47,590 --> 03:14:49,930
Especially for those of us who have been playing games for
decades.

2433
03:14:50,430 --> 03:14:54,330
Over the years, there have been many games, characters, and
franchises we've all wished would return.

2434
03:14:54,330 --> 03:14:55,690
Because come to Brazil.

2435
03:14:56,030 --> 03:14:59,410
I hope they'll be ready to announce at an event like this
one one day.

2436
03:14:59,990 --> 03:15:03,590
Tonight, I'm excited to share this piece of news with all of
you.

2437
03:15:11,970 --> 03:15:15,510
Playing a song that didn't win Music of the Year.

2438
03:15:21,710 --> 03:15:26,430
Oh god, the lighting direction was not very smart.

2439
03:15:27,330 --> 03:15:27,610
What?

2440
03:15:32,850 --> 03:15:34,090
He's me?

2441
03:15:35,130 --> 03:15:38,910
Yeah, no, that was a bad choice with the lighting direction.

2442
03:15:39,670 --> 03:15:41,930
I do not like that.

2443
03:15:45,090 --> 03:15:47,190
Bro, gamers play in the dark.

2444
03:15:47,410 --> 03:15:49,910
Why the fuck are you doing this to them?

2445
03:15:49,970 --> 03:15:50,550
Bada-da!

2446
03:15:57,090 --> 03:15:57,550
What is this?

2447
03:15:58,010 --> 03:15:58,610
Mega Man?

2448
03:16:00,330 --> 03:16:02,870
Yeah, I was gonna say, the ending was Mega Man.

2449
03:16:04,150 --> 03:16:04,530
Yay!

2450
03:16:09,870 --> 03:16:12,290
Yeah, I was gonna say, that sounded like Mega Man.

2451
03:16:19,180 --> 03:16:21,380
Well, are we getting a new Mega Man game?

2452
03:16:25,630 --> 03:16:28,990

2453
03:16:38,040 --> 03:16:40,230

so funny i'm bowser junior and i'm gonna be taking also why

2458
03:17:30,900 --> 03:17:34,080
did they get a grown man, the voice Bowser Jr.

2459
03:17:37,460 --> 03:17:38,980
Where's Pat's son?

2460
03:17:41,520 --> 03:17:47,920
I don't like the voice for Bowser Jr. He's like, his voice
is deeper than Bowser.

2461
03:17:48,180 --> 03:17:48,720
It's weird.

2462
03:17:54,490 --> 03:17:55,290
That's it?

2463
03:17:56,250 --> 03:17:58,790
That was like 10 seconds more content.

2464
03:18:00,130 --> 03:18:00,770
Oh, hey.

2465
03:18:06,010 --> 03:18:07,270
What is this?

2466
03:18:09,230 --> 03:18:11,250
Yeah, I was like, yay, new trailer!

2467
03:18:11,610 --> 03:18:15,550
And it gave us like, not even 10 seconds, like 5 seconds of
new content.

2468
03:18:19,460 --> 03:18:20,580
It's just Luigi.

2469
03:18:20,740 --> 03:18:23,320
I mean, to be fair, it's Luigi being badass, but still.

2470
03:18:26,940 --> 03:18:30,240
Oh my god, it's Neo 33.

2471
03:18:35,390 --> 03:18:38,110
Oh, I bet you, Kojumbo is now planning on...

2472
03:18:38,130 --> 03:18:56,290
poaching all the actors from from Expedition 33 for Death
Stranding 3 you started hiring them up 5 seconds of Luigi

2473
03:18:56,290 --> 03:19:05,910
I'm satisfied this war has an inevitable conclusion Death
Stranding 33

2474
03:19:10,450 --> 03:19:19,630
He's like, literally, he's, I feel like, uh, Kojumbo is now
collecting at Hollywood, like, celebrities, like the fucking

2475
03:19:19,630 --> 03:19:20,750
Infinity Stones.

2476
03:19:21,530 --> 03:19:25,690
Every tweet is just a new celebrity that showed up at his
office.

2477
03:19:27,430 --> 03:19:30,110
I'm, I always hear so much about solo leveling.

2478
03:19:30,230 --> 03:19:33,370
Is it actually good or is it, like, overhyped?

2479
03:19:39,440 --> 03:19:40,380
It's min.

2480
03:19:40,800 --> 03:19:52,980
You must have a really good like PR team then or at they
have like a like a lot of advertisement budget No story only

2481
03:19:52,980 --> 03:19:54,040
aura.

2482
03:19:54,640 --> 03:19:56,820
Ah, it just has good animation, right?

2483
03:20:00,340 --> 03:20:01,940
It's Korean sword art online.

2484
03:20:02,300 --> 03:20:03,960
Oh, nobody deserves that bro.

2485
03:20:04,780 --> 03:20:10,640
Nope No one deserves to be compared to that you

2486
03:20:13,920 --> 03:20:23,220
know sometimes our last reveal at the game awards is a
teaser for something years and years away not tonight our

2487
03:20:23,220 --> 03:20:32,600
final world premiere comes from 61 members of the team that
built titan fall four years ago the principals founded a new

2488
03:20:32,600 --> 03:20:39,840
independent studio with the hopes of pushing the shooter
genre forward with a new original game they've done it in

2489
03:20:39,840 --> 03:20:46,920
complete secrecy which is even more amazing because the game
is very deep into development the power of independent

2490
03:20:46,920 --> 03:20:53,440
self-published studios to push this medium forward is a
growing and i think positive theme in our industry and so

2491
03:20:53,440 --> 03:21:00,120
tonight you're not only going to get the announcement of the
game but also your first look at the gameplay i played it

2492
03:21:00,120 --> 03:21:08,220
and after after you see this trailer i think you're going to
want to as well don't with me don't we were laughing about

2493
03:21:08,220 --> 03:21:10,720
teddy fox don't fuck with me

2494
03:21:14,900 --> 03:21:17,160
No fucking way.

2495
03:21:17,820 --> 03:21:19,080
No fucking way.

2496
03:21:56,760 --> 03:21:57,840
No.

2497
03:21:57,940 --> 03:21:58,060
No.

2498
03:21:59,200 --> 03:22:02,200
Your light belongs to me.

2499
03:22:05,180 --> 03:22:09,560

to everybody who contributed and also i want to extend a

2571
03:31:50,160 --> 03:31:56,080
thank to the unsung heroes of this industry the people who
make tutorials on youtube on how to make a game because we

2572
03:31:56,080 --> 03:32:07,440
had no idea how to make a game before so what the fuck that
has to be a joke right and i'll extend a personal thank you

2573
03:32:07,440 --> 03:32:13,180
to an important man in my life, Mr. Hiro-Lonobu Sakaguchi,
who is before you know this game.

2574
03:32:13,200 --> 03:32:14,360
It's not a joke.

2575
03:32:14,360 --> 03:32:16,640
It inspired me to become a game there, so thank you, Mr.
Sakaguchi.

2576
03:32:17,140 --> 03:32:20,160
Guys, I don't think that was a joke, guys.

2577
03:32:22,040 --> 03:32:23,000
That's crazy.

2578
03:32:23,400 --> 03:32:24,500
Go, bro, drop the videos.

2579
03:32:24,660 --> 03:32:26,240
Maybe I can make the next clear.

2580
03:32:26,600 --> 03:32:32,260
Thank you to the players for all your covers, your fan arts,
your endless arguing about which ending is a good one.

2581
03:32:32,460 --> 03:32:33,680
That's a wonderful trade.

2582
03:32:34,220 --> 03:32:34,960
Thank you so much.

2583
03:32:35,400 --> 03:32:37,940
And I think that actions are worth more than words.

2584
03:32:39,240 --> 03:32:41,900
we promised some content a few months ago.

2585
03:32:42,400 --> 03:32:45,820
So I'm very happy to say that it's releasing now.

2586
03:32:45,880 --> 03:32:46,180
Oh!

2587
03:32:46,320 --> 03:32:47,620
And you can just go and play it free.

2588
03:32:48,600 --> 03:32:51,080
New weapons, new quests, new bosses, just the cool stuff.

2589
03:32:51,500 --> 03:32:53,180
So just thank you so much.

2590
03:32:54,520 --> 03:32:55,860
Oh, but the game is not free.

2591
03:32:55,920 --> 03:32:56,680
It's really wonderful.

2592
03:32:57,300 --> 03:32:59,100
So thank you and for those who come after.

2593
03:32:59,860 --> 03:33:01,560
Everybody's going to boot up that game now.

2594
03:33:08,360 --> 03:33:09,160
That's crazy.

2595
03:33:10,460 --> 03:33:12,240

2596
03:33:13,100 --> 03:33:14,580
The free DLC.

2597
03:33:20,370 --> 03:33:21,370
Congratulations to Sandfall.

2598
03:33:21,430 --> 03:33:23,510
That game should be on sale right now.

2599
03:33:23,770 --> 03:33:26,310
And that is going to do it for the Game Awards 2025.

2600
03:33:26,730 --> 03:33:27,910
There's no way!

2601
03:33:30,090 --> 03:33:32,590
They ended it with that trail.

2602
03:33:33,590 --> 03:33:35,610
And teams who debuted in new games tonight.

2603
03:33:36,030 --> 03:33:38,490
We'll see you again on Friday, June 5th.

2604
03:33:38,670 --> 03:33:41,770
Our biggest summer game fest ever from the Dolby Theater in
LA.

2605
03:33:42,130 --> 03:33:47,530
We'll be back right here at Peacock Theater for the Game
Awards next to December, thanks to our entire game.

2606
03:33:47,570 --> 03:33:48,330
I don't know.

2607
03:33:48,550 --> 03:33:50,630
I thought it was so psych.

2608
03:33:51,030 --> 03:33:51,570
Happy holidays.

2609
03:33:51,930 --> 03:33:52,610
Good night, everybody.

2610
03:33:53,050 --> 03:33:57,490
There's no way they ended it with that.

2611
03:34:04,060 --> 03:34:06,360
Yeah, but they ended it with free game, Doki.

2612
03:34:07,140 --> 03:34:07,700
You're right.

2613
03:34:07,720 --> 03:34:08,040
You're right.

2614
03:34:08,300 --> 03:34:11,420
The game is going to be free, guys.

2615
03:34:11,620 --> 03:34:14,080
The game's going to be free.

2616
03:34:20,360 --> 03:34:24,060
I mean, Miss Biggie warned us.

2617
03:34:24,700 --> 03:34:27,220
The dog warned us, guys.

2618
03:34:28,580 --> 03:34:30,560
That's, I think, three hours.

2619
03:34:30,740 --> 03:34:31,450
This was a...

2620
03:34:36,180 --> 03:34:38,280
That was three hours.

2621
03:34:38,280 --> 03:34:41,940
Oh, three, three, three and a half hours.

2622
03:34:42,120 --> 03:34:44,340
The longest Game Awards stream.

2623
03:34:46,280 --> 03:34:49,780
With the least amount of content I've ever seen.

2624
03:34:49,800 --> 03:34:50,860
Yeah.

2625
03:34:54,420 --> 03:34:57,560
At least, dang, at least the stream was fun, guys.

2626
03:34:57,900 --> 03:34:59,600
At least we had fun together.

2627
03:35:00,120 --> 03:35:07,220
You know, at least, at least we had fun together, guys.

2628
03:35:07,480 --> 03:35:09,100
That's, that's, that's all.

2629
03:35:10,100 --> 03:35:12,480
At least we were here together, chat.

2630
03:35:15,480 --> 03:35:17,440
Liquid, thank you for the Twitch Prime, thank you.

2631

Thank you.

2639
03:35:25,120 --> 03:35:25,780
Thank you.

2640
03:35:26,180 --> 03:35:27,380
Look at you believing shit.

2641
03:35:27,560 --> 03:35:29,340
That's what you get for having hope.

2642
03:35:30,020 --> 03:35:34,660
Um, well, James, I'm excited for.

2643
03:35:37,260 --> 03:35:38,720
Um, Star Wars?

2644
03:35:40,100 --> 03:35:43,120
I don't know what you want me to say, guys.

2645
03:35:43,180 --> 03:35:45,120
We all saw the same stream.

2646
03:35:45,480 --> 03:35:48,220
We all saw the same stream.

2647
03:35:49,420 --> 03:35:53,520
I guess the hero guard.

2648
03:35:55,360 --> 03:35:59,760
Guys, it's from the same desk as Titanfall and Apex, guys.

2649
03:36:00,320 --> 03:36:01,540
And it's free.

2650
03:36:01,700 --> 03:36:04,540
We're not losing anything from it.

2651
03:36:06,720 --> 03:36:07,240
Oh, sorry.

2652
03:36:07,640 --> 03:36:08,840
The high guard.

2653
03:36:09,300 --> 03:36:11,280
It looked like a hero shooter, okay?

2654
03:36:11,280 --> 03:36:12,420
It looked like a hero shooter.

2655
03:36:12,780 --> 03:36:17,260
The high guard and Star Wars.

2656
03:36:17,540 --> 03:36:19,400
I mean, Pod Racing looked really...

2657
03:36:19,420 --> 03:36:34,880
cool too even though we didn't get any gameplay footage and
it's pod racing um yeah i mean i'm back my team seems fine

2664
03:37:14,040 --> 03:37:16,200
molar like the furthest top left

2665
03:37:20,680 --> 03:37:27,880
So, it's very weird to sometimes, when I'm in the zone,
it's, like, you know, I'm not aware of it, but when, like,

2666
03:37:27,960 --> 03:37:33,760
you know, when I get hyper-fixated on the missing tube, I'm
trying not to touch it and everything, because I don't want

2667
03:37:33,760 --> 03:37:39,580
a dry socket, which apparently it's like, because, like, you
know, there's a hole in my socket right now where my tube

2668
03:37:39,580 --> 03:37:49,100
should be, and, um, and so if you accidentally poke the
blood clot that's, like, blocking the hole, it will be very

2669
03:37:49,100 --> 03:37:49,400
painful.

2670
03:37:49,420 --> 03:37:54,140
So I'm like trying not to do that and have yet to do that
yet.

2671
03:37:54,460 --> 03:37:59,980
So yeah So let's hope let's hope that that doesn't happen.

2672
03:38:00,360 --> 03:38:10,600
No monkey paw curl here So I'll tell more about the story
the dentist story on YouTube because like I don't want to

2673
03:38:10,600 --> 03:38:16,860
put it on the random Twitch pod so I'll give you guys more
about the story on YouTube because don't worry I have a huge

2674
03:38:16,860 --> 03:38:22,060
story to tell you guys when I'm back It's nice to be back
again because I really did miss streaming.

2675
03:38:22,340 --> 03:38:29,380
I try not to push myself too hard I really wanted to stream
a lot more, but I knew Too freak like, you know, mouth

2676
03:38:29,380 --> 03:38:34,780
recovery takes a while So I'm trying not to push myself too
hard, but I do miss streaming.

2677
03:38:34,920 --> 03:38:38,360
I do miss all you guys I always love like, you know, hanging
out with you guys dragons.

2678
03:38:38,540 --> 03:38:43,840
I hope you guys miss hanging out with me too and had a lot
of fun Today watching the streamer awards.

2679
03:38:44,280 --> 03:38:45,860
I'm sorry not streamer watching the game awards.

2680
03:38:45,980 --> 03:38:52,120
There's been so many award shows This might as well feel
like the streamer awards.

2681
03:38:55,600 --> 03:39:00,960
To be fair, the streamer awards had more content than the
game awards, if I have to be honest.

2682
03:39:10,390 --> 03:39:15,450
Anyway, to Juarez, thank you for tier one sub.

2683
03:39:15,590 --> 03:39:16,710

03:39:21,030 --> 03:39:23,030
These 300 bits were for Titan and Paul.

really want to catch up with all you guys soon about like my

2688
03:39:35,470 --> 03:39:42,450
adventures uh with the dentist i felt like i was just not
online for a week because of my tooth issues uh you know how

2689
03:39:42,450 --> 03:39:47,750
like my gums were swollen for a week and then like you know
got my tooth removed because they were like it's not say

2690
03:39:47,750 --> 03:39:49,910
salvageable and i was like oh okay

2691
03:39:53,190 --> 03:39:57,490
Rukinat, that very expensive Rukinat guy was apparently not
worth it.

2692
03:39:58,070 --> 03:39:59,910
I could have just removed that tooth.

2693
03:40:02,530 --> 03:40:04,090
Snell, thank you for your one-sub.

2694
03:40:04,230 --> 03:40:04,490
Thank you.

2695
03:40:04,730 --> 03:40:05,230
Thank you.

2696
03:40:06,030 --> 03:40:09,010
Sankas, thank you for the gifted one-sub to Rashi.

2697
03:40:09,230 --> 03:40:09,390
Thank you.

2698
03:40:09,730 --> 03:40:10,110
Thank you.

2699
03:40:13,630 --> 03:40:19,450
So yeah, I was practically like non-existent for a week, and
then I came back to social media.

2700
03:40:19,590 --> 03:40:21,330
I'm like, what the fuck happened here?

2701
03:40:23,590 --> 03:40:28,510
I'm just like pro stuff, but I'm like, anyway, game awards
time.

2702
03:40:34,430 --> 03:40:35,990
Anyway, I'm going to head off now.

2703
03:40:36,030 --> 03:40:39,510
Like I said, I don't want to push myself too hard today for
recovery.

2704
03:40:40,230 --> 03:40:41,710
Tomorrow I have the Hades.

2705
03:40:41,830 --> 03:40:46,510
I'm not going to be doing a fucking 10-hour stream for Hades
2 tomorrow because I do have my May Cafe.

2706
03:40:47,350 --> 03:40:50,770
Mean and greet slash live performance with Mint tomorrow as
well.

2707
03:40:50,870 --> 03:40:53,010
And that is also like a two-hour thing.

2708
03:40:53,190 --> 03:40:54,950
So, and I have to sing too.

2709
03:40:54,990 --> 03:40:58,270
I don't know how singing is going to be like with this.

2710
03:40:58,530 --> 03:40:59,930
So we're going to find out.

2711
03:41:00,790 --> 03:41:01,590
We're going to find out.

2712
03:41:01,590 --> 03:41:01,910
I know.

2713
03:41:02,310 --> 03:41:03,890
Pretty bad timing with everything.

2714
03:41:04,410 --> 03:41:13,870
But I felt like it'd be worse if I had a swollen, you know,
like if I delayed my tooth extraction until after the maid

2715
03:41:13,870 --> 03:41:15,630
cafe because my gums were swollen.

2716
03:41:15,750 --> 03:41:17,110
Like I'm not delaying that shit.

2717
03:41:17,930 --> 03:41:20,010
So we'll see how it goes tomorrow.

2718
03:41:22,070 --> 03:41:23,170
So hey, do you see?

2719
03:41:23,190 --> 03:41:28,630
tomorrow might not be too long of a stream just because I
want to make sure I have enough time for the maid cafe stuff

2720
