1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:20,760
Thank you.

2
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:04,230
Thank you.

3
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,880
hello

4
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:13,580
everyone hello hello my wife in Tokyo are you okay I am very
inside I'm very dead inside right now as I forgot about it

5
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:24,000
okay so Okay, so to give context as to why I'm here right
now, you're like, oh, wow, Doki, I thought you said you cast

6
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,800
the stream, you got to work on yourself.

7
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,120
I was like, yes, I do.

8
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:33,060
You might notice something very interesting in the title,
and it says, hashtag add.

9
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:44,480
So for those who are not well versed with Twitch, they added
this new system where partner streamers, you can...

10
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:52,120
can accept sponsors that are open to everyone and the amount
you get is dependent on your ccv that's why they crack down

11
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:59,620
super hard on bots as well so um because like that affects
like how much the payout's gonna be so these offers are like

12
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:06,880
open to all the partner streamers and it's like a little
dashboard that you click so i was like i was like i looked

13
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:15,560
at it and i was like well there's marble rivals on there and
i was like oh that's easy that's practically free money I'm

14
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:26,720
like I fucking play rivals it's just free money and then I
accepted it on December 13th because I was like oh that's

15
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,840
plenty of time there's so much time for me and I would
definitely be doing a guerrilla stream around those times

16
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:42,940
maybe I'll be doing guerrilla stream next week that's so
easy and then today I was like wait didn't I have that

17
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:55,360
Marvel rivals thing that I accepted and then I went to my
dashboard and he was like deadline is December 27th 12 a.m

18
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:10,400
we oh my god wait give me a second okay enable chat let's
get okay here you go sponsored by Marvel Rivals I can't talk

19
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:19,820
too much I have to guys you guys see the banner thing yeah
that's I was like, oh my god, because it has to go off for

20
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:20,380
an entire hour.

21
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,200
I like freaked out.

22
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,980
It's like, oh my god, we have to turn it on.

23
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,560
I almost forgot to turn it on.

24
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:37,840
So the deadline expires like in like one and a half hours.

25
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,840
So that's why I was freaking out.

26
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:49,260
Because apparently, apparently, It said that, like, if I
don't, if I accept an offer, like, for all the sponsors that

27
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:55,800
Twitch offers me, if I accept it and I don't do it, they,
like, penalize your account.

28
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,520
So, like, they'll be like, you said you would accept it, but
then you did it.

29
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,060
But it affects your sponsor rate.

30
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,060
So, like, it affects your offers and everything.

31
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,560
So I was just like, oh, no, no, no, I gotta do that.

32
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,180
Yeah, yeah.

33
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:14,480
So, like, you would get, like, less offers because you're
like, oh, you accepted this...

34
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:21,140
It was my bad because it is my bad because I thought it was
free money and I was like I have plenty of time And I

35
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:30,520
proceeded to be like I proceeded to have like been the most
fucking busiest month of my life I had like the May Cafe I

36
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:38,500
had the The conventions I had all these celebrations all
these events that I'm doing I was working on my 900k stuff

37
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:46,300

I realized I was like oh wait didn't i didn't i accept a

38
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,340
marvel rival sponsor because i thought it was free money

So we all know that it is sponsored by Marvel Rivals.

51
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,220
I started it.

52
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,640
Didn't accept it.

53
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,620
I did the thing.

54
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,740
Did I do it?

55
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,680
I never used this before.

56
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,500
I think I did it.

57
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,540
I did I succeed.

58
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,000
Did I...

59
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,160
Guys, give me a sec.

60
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,520
I gotta check if I did it correctly.

61
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,980
I've never done this.

62
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,420
Because it's like...

63
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,480
The reason why I have to say it very clearly.

64
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,680
Because I assume it is like...

65
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,920
They use like an AI to like make sure you say everything
correctly.

66
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,680
So I don't want them to be like, what the heck does she say?

67
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,680
Like, I don't want the AI to be like, I don't know what
she's saying.

68
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:59,720
I, so, so I want, I wanted to make sure they understood that
I had, I'll say it again, just in case, I'm going to read it

69
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:09,980
one more time, just so that they process that I said it
correctly like i'm so paranoid because like i don't i can't

70
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:17,840
technically i can't actually make mistakes here uh it didn't

That's why.

101
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,960
You guys hear that?

102
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,880
You hear that?

103
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,900
Okay, let's do 18 versus 18.

104
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:52,480
I want to try that again because I, like, I want to actually
experience 18 versus 18 without how, okay, well, actually

105
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,720
we'll do a quick match first to see if my frames are okay.

106
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:02,620
I need to see if my frames are okay because that was, that
was actual hell going through that.

107
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:14,240
to swear oh no whatever like they take like five dollars
every time i say so i have to make sure all right okay all

108
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:21,780
right it's fine the perfect way to test my frames is to play
hella also this is the perfect map for hella um

109
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:36,520
okay i don't know because like or speech involving hate
because i'm like i'm not singing it derogatorily so i think

110
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,640
All right It's fine.

111
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:48,860
Okay, I'm really paranoid because like this is like
different This is very different from how like I've done

112
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:55,560
sponsors because it's all like like you know, no one's
actually like like You know, it's all like done by like

113
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:07,320
computer By AI when it comes to like how things are done for
for these sponsors So I'm like wondering I'm like oh no All

114
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:07,480
right.

115
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:12,080
Oh, yeah the freedoms are see guys look this is how how the
frames are supposed to be, guys.

116
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,420
Wait, did I, like, minute?

117
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,020
Actually, did I...

118
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:16,640
Limit it?

119
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:17,880
No limit.

120
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,240
Alright, well...

121
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,360
Oh, why did that reset?

122
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,540
Usually it doesn't reset.

123
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,740
That should not reset, but well...

124
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,160
Alright, see, this is how it's supposed to look like.

125
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,820
Alright, it's not choppy anymore.

126
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,540
It actually works.

127
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,820
Like, I can actually see now.

128
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,260

129
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,960

I'm doing this and then 18 versus 18.

208
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,380
Because I want to know what that's like with, like, my
frames back.

209
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,020
Guys, we don't have to go that way.

210
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,060
You know there's another...

211
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,720
There's like three entrances, right?

212
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,460
Guys, you guys know that, right?

213
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,920
There is a front area right here.

214
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:45,800

215
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,720

Quick play!

223
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,340
Why are they running triple support?

224
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,400
Oh my god.

225
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:24,560

226
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,080
Bro, quick- I play quick play to avoid triple support.

227
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:29,600

I didn't take that thing seriously.

273
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,240
I was just like, oh, that's just a squirrel.

274
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,520
I can just walk back to it, right?

275
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,760
I unfortunately could not.

276
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,300
Surprisingly, I could not just walk back to it.

277
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:57,780

335
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,150
Zuna, thank you much.

336
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:08,690
Which prize?

337
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:09,490
Thank you.

338
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:09,750
Thank you.

339
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:15,670
Yeah, because the two other supports are fucking... He's
like, the two other supports are literally keeping him

340
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:16,290
alive.

341
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:24,110
It is very impromptu.

342
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,850
I was like, alright guys, I'm gonna do...

343
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:27,450
I actually was panicking.

344
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:28,630
I was like, oh, fuck!

345
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:30,590
Because, like, I remember I was...

346
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:37,330
Like, when I first saw the new sponsors tab, they were like,
oh, if you don't do your sponsors, you're gonna penalized

347
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:41,770
and your sponsor died and i was like oh what if there's was
really good sponsor that i really want to do in the future

348
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:51,770
but then i couldn't do it because you're that one time i
forgot about my my marvel rival sponsor jeff is the only

349
00:25:51,770 --> 00:26:01,210
dick you need the fact that he didn't even do like that's
how confident the guy was he was like no i've not got this

350
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:02,850
like nah i wouldn't

351
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:16,730

354
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:44,610

download the game and but it is i will say it is 100 plus

355
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:54,290
gigabytes uh just a little warning there might be a chance
where after you down try to download the game um we might be

356
00:26:54,290 --> 00:27:02,430
done uh but i believe in guys but maybe maybe there's hope
you know maybe your pc will perform a miracle

357
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:12,910
before maybe it'll be it'll finish downloading under 15
minutes i

358
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:22,240
will but then if you doubt or you can buy a console right
now and download it on console because there's apparently

359
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:34,280
less than 100 gigabytes on console you can download it on
steam or on your playstation store or or microsoft store is

360
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:39,160
that what it's called xbox xbox store i don't know i'm sorry

365
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:44,940
i'll do i'll do two games one game where it's now we're
coincidentally when we do randomize somehow they are all on

366
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:52,380
my team wouldn't that be so silly guys but it's not
dokeybird you literally you can just search up dokeybird and

Seven more slots.

It says not Doki Bird.

374
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:27,170
Sorry, I have to look up.

375
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:29,130
Not Doki Bird, guys.

376
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:31,630
Not Doki Bird.

377
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:35,030
Yeah, I realized I could just count this.

378
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,480
Five more, guys.

379
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,740
Five more slots.

380
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,430
Oh, oh, wait.

381
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:51,070
Two more.

382
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:51,950
Two more.

383
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:53,610
Come on.

384
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:54,970
Come on, come out.

385
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:56,050
Oh, I could start right now.

386
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,290
And then you guys would be down to play.

387
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:04,720
All right.

388
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,400
Oh, we're here.

389
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:05,940
We're in.

390
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,200
All right, let's start right away.

391
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:07,980
Start.

392
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,400
Game start.

393
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:15,520
All right.

394
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,540
Gord, thank you for the 500 bitties.

395
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,700
Okay, this time.

396
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,440
I wonder if...

397
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,720
Yeah, I think Gambit would be good.

398
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,140
What did we just...

399
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,780
Guys, what did we all go support?

400
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,840
We can never die.

401
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,640
What did we all go Gambit?

402
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,200
All Gambit.

403
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:43,660
guys if we all play gambit like just think about it if we're
all gambit is the most powerful it'll be like and they can

404
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:51,880
never heal think about it guys don't never be able to heal
because we'll just keep anti them just okay we're okay we

405
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:58,400
lost two of our gambit wait that's not okay guys for the
strat to work we have to be able guys i don't think the all

406
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:06,200
gambit strat is working guys okay maybe not guys i think we
gotta swap up to all get like swap off all gambits like i

407
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:19,320
think i don't know how but we already messed up the strat i
i don't know how wait wait i have an idea guys half gambit

408
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:25,840
half moon knight imagine just think about that they're all
bunched up think about they're all bunched up so like

409
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:34,280
because they're all bunched up um you can farm so much like
it's literally like easy cheat code

410
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:54,000
okay oh my god guys that's right that's right guys if we
keep doing gambit all like a gambit all that never ends yes

411
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,160
Okay, our strat is not working.

412
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,480
Wait, I have an idea.

413
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,260
Okay, wait, I have...

414
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:04,720
Oh, oh, and then I'll show you guys my master plan.

415
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:06,220
Watch this.

416
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,960
Okay, guys, the Hall Gambit might not be working anymore.

417
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,300
I think that was a mistake.

418
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,540
I might not be very good at theory crafting.

419
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:20,120
I might not be a great theory crafter.

420
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,020
Oh my god, the double Gambit.

421
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:34,040
guys why am i like 1v5 right now okay this is it guys watch
this watch this guys

422
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:47,490
watch this oh my god the whole thing okay right here oh my
god i'm doing so much damage though bro

423
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:52,350
wait where are they

424
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:56,510
Look at that!

425
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:57,110
Look at that!

426
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,030
Look at all that!

427
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:03,730
Oh my god, oh my god, okay, my fucking game lagged there.

428
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:11,090
Okay, this like random bullshit thing is not working out for
me.

429
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:16,250
Guys, why are you not grouping up?

430
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:16,790
Why?

431
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:19,750
The one time I need you to group up.

432
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:22,850
There you go.

433
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:32,230
There we go, there we go, there we go See random bullshit,
random bullshit Guys, group up, guys Enemy, enemy, group up

434
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:44,470
Hello, sir, sir, sir There we go, there we go Okay, they
figure out my strat Now they're not grouping up anymore,

435
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:54,990
guys Now I don't know, that was literally My only thing, my
only strat Like, I don't know, they already like Fucked up

436
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:57,750
my plan Wait, how do I...

437
00:33:58,810 --> 00:33:59,730
Oh, there it is.

438
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,950
Oh my god, wait, what hit me?

439
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,050
Where the fuck?

440
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:07,750
There was a... I can't tell what hit me.

441
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:11,610
Okay, guys, I figured out the new strat in the beginning.

442
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:14,050
This is the strat right here.

443
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:19,550
It's okay, look at that, look at that.

444
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:21,270
Free farm, free farm.

445
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:23,490
I already got my own, I got my own, I got my own.

446
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,370
Oh my god.

447
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:32,430
Guys, is this sort of noticeable that I don't play Moon
Knight?

448
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:42,390
Okay, I think like my lack of Moon Knight.

449
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:46,720
Okay, I still got him.

450
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:48,490
No!

451
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:53,430
Never would have guessed.

452
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:56,890
Wait!

453
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:58,310
Wait, guys, okay.

454
00:34:58,950 --> 00:34:59,210
Okay.

455
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:01,690
I know what to do now.

456
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,490
I have the perfect theory.

457
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,430
The perfect theory now.

458
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:07,410
Guys, guys, guys.

459
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:10,050
Okay, my first meta-crafting did not go so well.

460
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:10,990
But don't worry, guys.

461
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:12,330
I can learn from this.

462
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:16,390
Look, I can learn from this.

463
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:17,710
I can build on this.

464
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:18,170
All right.

465
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:19,370
Random swap.

466
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:20,390
Here, we'll try again.

467
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:24,130
I randomized it.

468
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:29,490
this watch this

469
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:46,520
okay what we do guys we go in with moon night first because
everyone will be grouped up together guys think about that

470
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:52,900
think think they're all gonna be grouped up together rushing
in and then okay they might be stream sniping right now but

471
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:57,500
they don't know that okay maybe i'm fucking with them you
know maybe i'm not on moon night right now you know now

472
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,840
they're too big Okay, watch this.

473
00:35:59,020 --> 00:35:59,820
And then, oh, look at that.

474
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,300
Look at that.

475
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,940
Look at, look at them all grouped up.

476
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,820
And, and, look at that.

477
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,540
All grouped up.

478
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:08,560
Look at that.

479
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,020
Oh, my God.

480
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,060
See, I told you.

481
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,240
I told you.

482
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,080
I told you that they'll be all grouped up.

483
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,020
I just didn't hit my shot, though.

484
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:24,780
The first part, the first part, they're always grouped up.

485
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:28,830
See?

486
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:33,490
Okay, I told you!

487
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:34,770
I told you!

488
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:36,910
My theory!

489
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:40,190
I theory crafted.

490
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:40,910
Now!

491
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:43,030
Now I can swap.

492
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:46,930
Now I can swap.

493
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:50,830
After I conducted my perfect theory craft.

494
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:55,820
There we go.

495
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,680
What the?

496
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,420
Oh, fuck.

497
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,460
Don't look at that one, though.

498
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,200
Don't look at...

499
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,060
Don't look at that, though.

500
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:16,610
Get hot forever.

522
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,260
I don't want to be down there.

523
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,860

That's illegal.

535
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:31,390

00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:03,870

00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:13,250
I'm fine with that.

553
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:14,450
Now I just need...

554
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:14,790

556
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:28,430

worked my theory craft worked we go in with moon night

557
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:37,250
because they all are always grouped up together and then the
second one and the second and then the second half we i swap

558
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:47,870
gambit easy easiest game of my life see the moon night one

00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:49,690
Okay, now, GG's everyone.

560
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:52,410
Now I go back to rank.

561
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:53,750
Now I actually play a rank game.

562
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:56,730
I have not played rank in a long time, so I cannot wait to
get...

563
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:57,950
Well, that's...

564
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:00,410
That might be a semi-live, because I did play rank
off-stream.

565
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:03,310
I haven't played rank since Monday.

566
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:04,870
Was it Monday?

567
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:05,970

00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:06,950

573
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:22,030
All right, here we go.

574
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:24,370
I can't wait to get yelled at today.

575
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:26,550
I worked.

576
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,570
I did a 9-5 in overtime.

577
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:30,970
And then I can't wait to get yelled at.

578
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:35,030
Technically, I can't wait to get yelled at on my overtime.

579
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:42,190
You get used to it.

580
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:45,310
It's like, you know, it's like working in retail.

581
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:46,010
Yeah.

582
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:47,810
How am I going to vanish from this match?

583
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:53,210
Oh yeah, I need to remember to swap the chat to this one.

584
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:54,050
Oh wait, not this one.

585
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:54,990
Where's the other one?

586
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:59,050
Where's the one where you can see my teammates die and
disappoint me as always?

587
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:12,070
I'm too lazy.

588
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:14,370
All right, we won't be able to look at my teammates.

589

00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:50,450
I hope you had a great stream All right, only bad low-key
that means they have a gamut player, but they don't want to

595
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:53,430

We're snatched.

603
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,850
I made it back in time to reality.

604
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:46,030
We'll be fine.

605
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:49,210
We forced refresh.

606
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:52,810
I did a forced reboot on the brain.

607
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:55,270
Alright.

608
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:58,510
Oh, I just didn't do this earlier.

609
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,140
There you go.

610
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:04,540
I got free all charge from that.

611
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:07,700
Oh, they do have a Spider-Man.

612
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:11,340
I mean, I'm on Gambit, but I also need my suit to protect.

613
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:12,760
I'll save my shit.

614
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:16,860
Yeah, I don't want to be over there.

615
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,500
I'm going to save it for years.

616
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:25,330
We're fine.

617
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:25,750
We're fine.

618
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:26,970
See, we're so healthy.

619
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:29,450
And I've got an anti in there, too.

620
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:30,950
That's my damage for the day.

621
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:36,170
I want to do more damage, but like, I'm too scared for my
team right now.

622
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:36,790
Okay, I can't.

623
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:40,310
What the fuck did I do damage on?

624
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:43,450
Nice.

625
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:45,950

It's okay.

630
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:54,150
I wasted my card, but it's okay.

631
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:56,650
She just timed her jump at the perfect moment.

632
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:00,450
Alright, I'm just gonna get out of here.

633
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:03,970

674
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:11,720
When I have...

675
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,760
When the Starlord shows up, I'll ult it.

676
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,820
And then I'll save my cards.

677
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:19,800
Where the fuck is our Starlord?

678
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,900

679
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:23,780
Oh, there we go.

680
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:28,620

682
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:35,500

00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:29,010
A bunch of fucking plagues.

694
00:50:29,170 --> 00:50:31,950
Jesus Christ, he got destroyed in the bird form.

695
00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:32,990
That's what I'm saying.

696
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:35,010
That should have been what's happening to me.

697
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:39,530
That's really that's what I'm saying.

698
00:50:39,630 --> 00:50:49,610
I was like, how come our hella died so fast Yet, yet I felt
like I'm shooting hella forever

701
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:05,490
Oh My god, oh my god, okay.

00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:47,550
I'm gonna keep my...

00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:49,870

712
00:51:57,890 --> 00:52:00,310
I can't believe...

713
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:04,050
I don't have all for this.

714
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:06,570
Oh.

715
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:08,710
There we go.

716
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:12,810
Just throw more cards, bro.

717
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:18,430
Yeah, I blew up so fast.

718
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:19,630
That's why I was so surprised.

719
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:23,410
I was, like, not expecting myself to, like, die that quickly
in my ult.

720
00:52:23,830 --> 00:52:26,090
I was like, what the fuck happened to me?

721
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:29,450
If I went aggressive, because I was like, I'll be fine,
right?

722
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:30,310
I was full HP.

723
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:34,250
Clearly, I was not fine.

724
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:35,770
Goodbye, Mac.

725
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:37,750
Oh.

726
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:40,630
There we go, at least I got him.

727
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:44,430
Look, our mag comes back, but the hell that does it.

728
00:52:45,090 --> 00:52:47,710
So these are little things we can take.

729
00:52:49,730 --> 00:52:51,030
Oh, he has diamond form.

730
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:52,590
I miscounted the cooldown.

731
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:57,370
I'll be down here.

732
00:52:57,510 --> 00:52:58,170
Thank you.

733
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:00,470
I shall wait here.

734
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:05,510
Oh my god, that's goddamn stupid shield.

735
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:11,440
Yeah, votes, dude.

736
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:15,660
The hard part, at least I get DPS more here.

737
00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:20,910
There we go.

738
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:23,530
I'm not gonna go aggression right now.

739
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:31,910
Yeah, you might notice.

740
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:35,470
You might, oh my god, that's unlucky.

741
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:38,270
That is so unlucky.

742
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:42,270
I have to reload, are you fucking...

743
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:46,400
Jesus Christ.

744
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:47,520
Hey, guys.

745
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,780
I'm still on the Emma

746
00:53:57,420 --> 00:54:14,200
Okay, I can't do anything about it I'm just to, I'm just to

748
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:22,600
It's okay.

749
00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:30,090
It's okay.

750
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:31,990
I don't know how I live for so long.

751
00:54:32,110 --> 00:54:32,850
It's not okay.

752
00:54:33,630 --> 00:54:35,010
It's not okay.

753
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:41,040
Oh my god.

754
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:42,560
We all went triple support.

755
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,040
We all got it.

756
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:45,260
Guys, you got a touch point.

757
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:46,680
You got a touch point.

758
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:50,920
The current score is 0, 2, 3.

759
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:52,760
Guys, in the end, it might not have been okay.

760
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:55,560
Might not have been okay guys.

761
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:01,790
You'll need a top-notch team to win this one.

762
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:03,730
Make way for the King of Tees.

763
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:07,070
I will have to say...

764
00:55:08,650 --> 00:55:09,170
No.

765
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:13,650
Can I go Hella and you go you go Namur?

766
00:55:13,870 --> 00:55:16,610
I will have to say I've never played Namur before.

767
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:21,380
That...

768
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:24,640
I will have to say that it wasn't me this time.

769
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:25,460
Okay?

770
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:31,780
It was me against Like I don't know what happened to
everyone else and we are on triple support.

771
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:40,740
So we have no damage It's like the only ones that were alive
were the supports and all we could do was just keep each

772
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:45,580
other alive and like against the fucking Emma And I'm like
I'm guys like I don't know.

773
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:46,320
I don't know.

774
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:48,300
She's like a fucking diamond form like what am I good?

775
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,560
I have playing cards versus a goddamn diamond.

776
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:53,180
What the fuck am I gonna do against that guy?

777
00:55:57,620 --> 00:56:00,180
But my cards are made of paper, guys.

778
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:02,320
She's made of literal diamond.

779
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:05,380
I can't even give diamonds a paper cut.

780
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,460
Oh, wait, man.

781
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:09,820
They can put a Twitch prom.

782
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:10,400
They can think.

783
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:13,260
Yeah, let me just throw my cards really, really hard.

784
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:15,180
That should work.

785
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:20,620
Yeah, I'm just gonna...

786
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:22,540
Okay.

787
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:24,180
Okay.

788
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,200
That was crazy.

789
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:30,620
I feel like I have to be like...

790
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,060
Jesus, Chris.

791
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:37,420
Ah, burns so fast.

792
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:41,860
I hope someone looks at our head up.

793
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:42,540
Oops, alright.

794
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:49,400
Look, you wanted heals from me.

795
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:51,200
Alright, that's what you're gonna get.

796
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,900
If you want Gambit heals, I will destroy.

797
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:57,060
I will destroy your fucking platforms.

798
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:59,500
Like, I can't control that, guys.

799
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:05,200
Unfortunately, my cards cannot...

800
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,760
It's not very precise.

801
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:09,380
It is a range.

802
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:11,320
Okay.

803
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:13,620
I want to use my anti, but...

804
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:15,720
Unfortunately, like...

805
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,500
My team is...

806
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,400
Even with triple support.

807
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,380
Oh, they double support all this!

808
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:24,260
They double support all this!

809
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:25,520
That's good, that's good, that's...

810
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:27,600
Okay, so, um...

811
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:33,400
I could not cleanse that because I ran out of cards.

812
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,800
I may or may not have ran out of cards there.

813
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:38,940
But it's okay.

814
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:42,520
I do have another one.

815
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:43,920
The word now, now.

816
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,700
They use all alts, guys.

817
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,180
We can only go up from here.

818
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:54,500
There we go.

819
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:54,660

820
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:55,500
Oh my god, there.

821
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:56,180
See, you can't kneel.

822
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:56,960
She can't kneel anymore.

823
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,240
We cracked your legs.

824
00:57:58,800 --> 00:57:59,280

00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:15,020
Oh my god, I fucking knew it.

849
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:17,640
I had a feeling he was behind us.

850
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:19,860
I'm backing out, guys.

851
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:21,160
Like, fuck that shit.

852
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:24,600
We're not... Oh, I bumped into a wall.

853
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:26,940
Oh, yeah.

854
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:27,700
I can't beat.

855
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:29,060
There we go.

856
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:31,340
It's okay.

857
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:33,020
I didn't die, though.

858
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,140
Might as well be a KDA player right now.

859
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:40,340
It's literally free alt charge for me.

860
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:43,280
I know that.

861
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:44,880
I know that name where it's somewhere.

862
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:45,800
That's all he does.

863
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:49,880
He's literally like, he finds a hiding spot and then fucking
goes at it.

864
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:52,380
You're fine.

865
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:53,140
You're so healthy.

866
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:55,760
There's nothing to panic about.

867
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:56,940

01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:16,640
Okay, we got this.

888
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,220
This all never-ending support.

889
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:21,600
Oh my god.

890
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:22,840
Okay, it's fine.

891
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:26,700
The never-ending support.

892
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:31,400
Please, please kill him.

893
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:33,560
Please kill him.

894
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:34,480
Oh!

895
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:38,100
It never falls.

896
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:43,200
Oh, okay.

897
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:43,740
That's okay.

898
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:45,760
I'll just save it for myself.

899
01:02:52,290 --> 01:02:53,650
Everything is okay.

900
01:02:58,380 --> 01:02:59,720
Who is complaining?

901
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:01,220
Oh, it's Seric Mantis.

902
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:01,780
What's wrong?

903
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:04,500
What's wrong with their fucking gambit?

904
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,620
He's doing his best.

905
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:13,970
Oh my god.

906
01:03:14,030 --> 01:03:16,510
I'm fucking like 360 everywhere.

907
01:03:17,170 --> 01:03:18,930
I'm trying to...

908
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:25,410
Oh my god, bro, I'm trying to make sure everybody is getting
healed, but not everybody is getting healed.

909
01:03:26,350 --> 01:03:27,250
I guess we back out.

910
01:03:27,350 --> 01:03:28,410
We're so scared.

911
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:31,690
It's not gonna come for me, right?

912
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:36,640
There we go.

913
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:38,480
That's free all charge right there.

914
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:41,400
I'll take these free all charge.

915
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:43,640
There you go.

916
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:44,120
He can't aim.

917
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:44,580
That's good.

918
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:47,580
Oh my god, our hellas was fucking crazy, bro.

919
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,500
Yeah, I'm fucking gotta come back.

920
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:51,900
to you.

921
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:53,360
Oh, I'm so confused.

922
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:54,160
Where are we going?

923
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:56,360
I swear.

924
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:59,340
I'm like, I'm like looking everywhere.

925
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:00,720
I'm like, where are we going?

926
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:03,220
I'm going to push the cart.

927
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:05,520
All right.

928
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:09,320
Oh, God.

929
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:10,500
There we go.

930
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:13,280
That's fine.

931
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:15,500
Gambit never falls here, too.

932
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:17,940
That's okay.

933
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:19,600
I think.

934
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:23,380
Oh, I I've never seen this area before.

935
01:04:25,340 --> 01:04:26,100
Where am I?

936
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:27,980
Wait, that was a new area.

937
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:31,300
Oh, he's dead.

938
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:31,820
He's dead.

939
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:35,500
There we go.

940
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:36,420
Two down.

941
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:46,800
I swear to God, if I see a Namor right behind me, I swear to
God.

942
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:50,560
Okay.

943
01:04:50,920 --> 01:05:00,770
Oh, there's a I'm shooting him as hard as I can There's only
so much as hard as I can shoot

944
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:15,600
Oh my god They are solid forever I have to do a DPS with
this Please!

945
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:19,940
Captain America, please!

946
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:23,560
Oh my god Oh my god!

947
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:28,560
Oh my god.

948
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:30,880
I have to.

949
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:39,440
I'm gonna fucking, I'm gonna go for the supports.

950
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,140
The three supports in the corner.

951
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,480
I'm gonna go for the fucking.

952
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:47,240
Okay, I got the fucking gavit.

953
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:48,440
I got both supports.

954
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:52,280
One support I didn't get.

955
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:54,820
The one support I didn't get.

956
01:05:57,580 --> 01:06:00,300
Please, I got so many plays.

957
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:02,280
Oh my

958
01:06:05,470 --> 01:06:05,530

959
01:06:13,330 --> 01:06:15,250
Oh god, okay.

960
01:06:17,830 --> 01:06:18,930
I like this.

961
01:06:19,170 --> 01:06:21,650
I have 33 kills.

962
01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:26,890
Okay.

963
01:06:27,370 --> 01:06:27,570
Okay.

964
01:06:27,770 --> 01:06:29,110
I'll go guard the heals.

965
01:06:32,750 --> 01:06:35,010
Like, I think I have to...

966
01:06:35,010 --> 01:06:36,870
My goal is just to kill the supports.

967
01:06:37,190 --> 01:06:37,670
My...

968
01:06:41,850 --> 01:06:47,610
I literally killed, I kept killing their supports over and
over again.

969
01:06:49,450 --> 01:06:50,250
Finally.

970
01:06:52,470 --> 01:06:55,690
Oh my god, I literally got three.

971
01:06:56,430 --> 01:07:02,790
Of course, the one support I didn't kill was Makinia, the
one that had their support all.

972
01:07:10,370 --> 01:07:12,190
Oh my god, bro.

973
01:07:14,770 --> 01:07:16,150
I'm gonna be...

974
01:07:16,150 --> 01:07:17,010
Oh my god.

975
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:17,890
I don't...

976
01:07:17,890 --> 01:07:18,930
I don't want...

977
01:07:18,930 --> 01:07:19,730
I don't...

978
01:07:19,730 --> 01:07:23,090
I'm going in with, like, low expectations here for this
game.

979
01:07:26,730 --> 01:07:29,790
I was just pushing against...

980
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:32,270
Pushing against this Elo right now.

981
01:07:35,130 --> 01:07:36,990
30 seconds before you attack.

982
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:46,700
Yeah, it's my first rank match too.

983
01:07:53,190 --> 01:07:59,250
Alright, I'm gonna go get the easy alt charge real quick.

984
01:08:05,510 --> 01:08:09,870
I fucked it up, but that's fine.

985
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:12,650
He lives.

986
01:08:15,730 --> 01:08:18,650
Oh my god, why are we backing up?

987
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:23,950
Guys, oh my god.

988
01:08:25,530 --> 01:08:26,410
We're backing up.

989
01:08:26,650 --> 01:08:33,590
You guys are all, guys, I don't know if our takes notice
this, but you are literally full HP.

990
01:08:34,090 --> 01:08:37,250
I should not be, where is my mag?

991
01:08:38,410 --> 01:08:42,290
Mag, mag, I, come here, come here, come here, come.

992
01:08:42,630 --> 01:08:43,950
Mag, mag.

993
01:08:47,110 --> 01:08:48,230
Holy shit!

994
01:08:49,130 --> 01:08:52,110
Our mag, oh my god, our mag does not play mag.

995
01:08:52,230 --> 01:08:53,790
Our mag actually does not play tank.

996
01:08:53,990 --> 01:08:57,290
There is no way he is so scared right now.

997
01:08:58,010 --> 01:08:59,590
That's actually crazy.

998
01:09:03,250 --> 01:09:04,510
Look, we have a pick.

999
01:09:06,510 --> 01:09:07,710
We actually have a pick.

1000
01:09:10,510 --> 01:09:11,750
Like, I'll keep the...

1001
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:16,860

I stubbed my toe.

1008
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:27,620
I stubbed my toe.

1009
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:34,580
He literally fucking gets hit one time and can't fucking
push up.

1010
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:41,780
The fact that I was in front of him as a guy with 275 HP and
I was okay.

1011
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:44,020
I, everything was fine.

1012
01:10:46,140 --> 01:10:49,380
Bro, you're so scared of getting fucking infected.

1013
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:50,660
Get ready.

1014
01:10:54,180 --> 01:11:01,900
I don't know now, but they got such a free fucking push
because we didn't push out for some fucking reason.

1015
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:04,840
He was so goddamn scared.

1016
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:08,200
Bullets are scary.

1017
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:09,920
Master of Magnetism.

1018
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:13,800
That's so true.

1019
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:19,800
He did not believe in us at all.

1020
01:11:20,260 --> 01:11:21,400
It's actually wild.

1021
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:25,940
so fucking scared for no reason.

1022
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:29,340
Oh, oh my god.

1023
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,080
That's crazy that he's going forward now.

1024
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:34,160
That's actually crazy.

1025
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:40,420
Like, oh, now you're not scared.

1026
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:42,580
Sick.

1027
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:48,060
Bro,

1028
01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:52,880
I got, okay, we had to go over.

1029
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:53,380
worry.

1030
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:59,670
There you go.

1031
01:12:00,570 --> 01:12:01,990
Bullet no longer scary.

1032
01:12:09,410 --> 01:12:11,410
Wait, he is 1 HP.

1033
01:12:13,210 --> 01:12:13,690
Oh my god!

1034
01:12:14,190 --> 01:12:14,630
Oh my god!

1035
01:12:14,910 --> 01:12:14,910
Mac!

1036
01:12:15,290 --> 01:12:17,750
Mac, you cannot be fucking with me right now.

1037
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:22,570
Like, are you actually serious, Mac?

1038
01:12:22,910 --> 01:12:24,870
No, I'm trying.

1039
01:12:31,630 --> 01:12:36,390
I'm I'm actually trying to heal you so bad.

1040
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:42,580
Okay, there you go.

1041
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:46,020
Now he's got the power of friendship.

1042
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:54,160
He's got...

1043
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:55,000
He's got...

1044
01:12:55,860 --> 01:12:56,980
He actually...

1045
01:12:56,980 --> 01:12:58,480
He's got the power of friendship.

1046
01:12:58,660 --> 01:12:59,340
Now he's okay.

1047
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:00,900
Now he's okay.

1048
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:01,860
No, he...

1049
01:13:01,860 --> 01:13:06,120
Spunky almost died there because he actually finally pushed
him.

1050
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:20,380
that's insane that's actually insane he got drunk with power
he was just like guys no guys he's like oh wait i do have

1051
01:13:20,380 --> 01:13:25,380
triple support let me just be the only one to run up to them
and respond

1052
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:38,940
oh yeah 20 points after like the fucking shit i had to pull
20 have the same final hits as our fucking date.

1053
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:47,060
Jesus Christ.

1054
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:50,700
Bro, look at their gambit.

1055
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:52,500
Five final hits.

1056
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:55,540
I have 13 final hits.

1057
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:58,140
This man has five.

1058
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:04,500
I literally had to, like, kill their support.

1059
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:06,100
It's like, at least four.

1060
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:09,160
times before we could fucking win.

1061
01:14:11,340 --> 01:14:12,160
Wait, was he Lord?

1062
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:13,360
There's no way.

1063
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:15,620
Oh my God, he was Lord.

1064
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:17,740
Oh my God.

1065
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:20,340
Oh, I'm sorry, bro.

1066
01:14:21,140 --> 01:14:23,160
Clearly I needed this more than you, bro.

1067
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:24,220
Look at my team.

1068
01:14:26,260 --> 01:14:27,860
I needed it more.

1069
01:14:28,820 --> 01:14:30,160
I was more passionate.

1070
01:14:31,540 --> 01:14:32,560
Oh, did I do it?

1071
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:33,140
Was it?

1072
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:33,980
Oh my God.

1073
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:35,680
Wait, did I do it correctly?

1074
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:38,260
Wait, how do I even know if...

1075
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:38,940
Okay, I have no...

1076
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:39,500
Oh, completed!

1077
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:40,340
Yay!

1078
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:42,160
I'll play one more.

1079
01:14:42,580 --> 01:14:44,660
I feel a little weird if I just...

1080
01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:45,240
Don't worry, guys.

1081
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:46,060
I'll do one more.

1082
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:47,580
I think...

1083
01:14:47,580 --> 01:14:49,600
Maybe the next game will be more relaxing.

1084
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,880
Maybe the next game.

1085
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:54,060
Maybe...

1086
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:54,660
Let me...

1087
01:14:54,660 --> 01:14:56,640
I can tone down the moderation now.

1088
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:57,460
Yeah.

1089
01:14:59,380 --> 01:15:01,160
Oh, I never saved it.

1090
01:15:01,220 --> 01:15:01,620
Whoops.

1091
01:15:02,740 --> 01:15:03,880
Ooh, that's funny.

1092
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:05,500
Okay, I don't think they noticed.

1093
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:09,960
Because it was like, make sure to have it on moderation too.

1094
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:11,300
But it said I completed it.

1095
01:15:11,620 --> 01:15:14,500
So I did it.

1096
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:19,900
Because they're like, make sure to have it on moderation
level 2.

1097
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:21,940
And I was like, moderation level 1.

1098
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:23,100
Let's go.

1099
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:26,100
All right.

1100
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:28,240
Whatever happens in this game is the last game.

1101
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:29,320
I'm sorry.

1102
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:32,280
I know it was the shortest Marvel rival stream of your life.

1103
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:34,240
But I do have...

1104
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:36,120
I'm trying to be a responsible.

1105
01:15:36,140 --> 01:15:36,720
person.

1106
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:43,120
I mean, it really just does, like, counteract to the whole
point that I almost forgot about the sponsor that I had to

1107
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:43,800
do.

1108
01:15:46,460 --> 01:15:47,420
It might...

1109
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:51,820
But I said I was trying to be a responsible person.

1110
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:55,120
Like, I didn't say I'm doing a good job at it.

1111
01:16:02,890 --> 01:16:04,170
I made it, though.

1112
01:16:04,210 --> 01:16:07,690
Yeah, the thing is, I did make it in the end.

1113
01:16:07,990 --> 01:16:09,270
I got there.

1114
01:16:11,510 --> 01:16:18,530

there what's that word called for it i know there's a

1127
01:18:50,710 --> 01:18:57,690
specific word for it is it pressured when you're most
pressured i feel like there's a word for it because i get my

1128
01:18:57,690 --> 01:19:05,970
most creative ideas uh yes it's procrastinating but like i
literally get like my most creative ideas when i'm like uh

closer it's not good obviously i would i would I will say

1130
01:19:12,950 --> 01:19:15,730

01:19:16,070 --> 01:19:17,090
Yeah, under pressure, yeah.

1132
01:19:17,310 --> 01:19:18,230
Spider, isn't that weird?

1133
01:19:18,710 --> 01:19:22,710
Yeah, I work best under, like, under pressure.

1134
01:19:23,470 --> 01:19:24,850
It's not good, though, but I don't know.

1135
01:19:24,950 --> 01:19:27,090
My brain is just fucked up like that.

1136
01:19:28,470 --> 01:19:30,050
I had, like, the most brilliant.

For the 900k.

1142
01:19:40,330 --> 01:19:42,050
And by pivot, I meant, like, today.

Like in terms of like how to do the, how to do the thing I
want to show you guys.

1144

They have Loki at them.

1145
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:56,920
Not going to be great.

1146
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:57,540
He will stop.

1147
01:19:58,940 --> 01:19:59,620

1148
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:00,180
Keep driving.

1149
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:03,180
Oh my god.

01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:04,620
I fucked up the info.

1151
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:06,440
It's fine.

1152
01:20:06,740 --> 01:20:07,800
He doesn't know.

1153
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:10,760
It's okay.

1154
01:20:10,820 --> 01:20:11,580
He did not know.

1155
01:20:18,450 --> 01:20:18,890
Guys.

1156
01:20:19,030 --> 01:20:20,890
I do not have...

1157
01:20:20,890 --> 01:20:23,290
Oh my god, he's punching me.

1158
01:20:29,530 --> 01:20:31,650
No, it already automatically counted.

1159
01:20:31,850 --> 01:20:33,310
I don't have to end the stream before midnight.

1160
01:20:33,970 --> 01:20:36,290
Like, the moment it counted, it just goes like...

1161
01:20:36,290 --> 01:20:37,910
They're just like, okay, we're done.

1162
01:20:39,830 --> 01:20:40,370
Nope, okay.

1163
01:20:41,330 --> 01:20:45,110
I saw him, I saw him, but like...

1164
01:20:45,110 --> 01:20:48,350
You know, like, when the arrow just is fired, and then you
see him?

1165
01:20:50,610 --> 01:20:52,930
I literally saw the arrow got fired.

1166
01:20:52,990 --> 01:20:54,510
And then I was like, it's too late.

1167
01:20:54,750 --> 01:21:01,130
It's too late for me There's nothing to do It's like Mr.
President kid.

1168
01:21:01,670 --> 01:21:03,110
Oh my god.

1169
01:21:05,230 --> 01:21:10,550
Okay Okay, oh Coffee first Hawking free coffee Okay,

1170
01:21:15,190 --> 01:21:26,530
I I I had to do that because there is a Hawking right behind
and I have pinged them three times.

1171
01:21:28,930 --> 01:21:29,230
What?

1172
01:21:29,690 --> 01:21:34,250
I have pinged this guy three times and we didn't even look
behind us.

1173
01:21:34,430 --> 01:21:35,530
It's actually crazy.

1174
01:21:35,990 --> 01:21:37,510
That's not even on...

1175
01:21:37,510 --> 01:21:38,290
That's on them.

1176
01:21:39,430 --> 01:21:41,550
They did not look back.

1177
01:21:41,810 --> 01:21:42,810
There's a mag behind.

1178
01:21:43,510 --> 01:21:44,250
We're at it.

1179
01:21:45,070 --> 01:21:46,350
Got it.

1180
01:21:47,270 --> 01:21:49,070
That's on them at that point.

1181
01:21:49,710 --> 01:21:51,390
Like, there's nothing I can do to fix that.

1182
01:21:54,270 --> 01:21:56,130
Oh my god.

1183
01:21:56,710 --> 01:21:58,990
You fucking ran away from my thing.

1184
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:07,220
I can't hear anything about it.

1185
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:09,680
Hello.

1186
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,120
I got one healer.

1187
01:22:13,540 --> 01:22:15,380
I only wish I had done it myself.

1188
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:19,820
Hello guys, there is a venom behind us unfortunately.

1189
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:22,240
And I shall now heal.

1190
01:22:28,490 --> 01:22:29,570
Hello, guys.

1191
01:22:31,150 --> 01:22:34,820
I am sorry, but I had to back up.

1192
01:22:38,090 --> 01:22:40,710
We gotta protect for her supports, guys.

1193
01:22:43,970 --> 01:22:46,050
I should have looked back at her, Luna.

1194
01:22:46,370 --> 01:22:47,650
I didn't think that...

1195
01:22:47,650 --> 01:22:53,230
I saw that he was okay with Venom, but I didn't realize the
Iron Fist came out as well.

1196
01:22:53,670 --> 01:22:54,210
I...

1197
01:22:54,210 --> 01:22:54,850

1198
01:22:55,630 --> 01:22:56,170

1199
01:22:56,170 --> 01:22:56,910

All right, here we go.

1203
01:23:36,490 --> 01:23:39,350
I am a little scared of that though.

1204
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:43,800
I waited.

1205
01:23:46,340 --> 01:23:51,000
I did indeed wait, waited, but I had to.

1206
01:23:55,990 --> 01:23:57,690
Oh my god.

1207
01:23:57,970 --> 01:23:59,510
Oh my god, there's the Hawkeye.

1208
01:24:00,110 --> 01:24:01,090
Oh my god.

1209
01:24:01,550 --> 01:24:02,270

1210
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:14,880

1212
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:37,200

1215
01:24:44,770 --> 01:24:45,370
Alright.

1216
01:24:47,990 --> 01:24:49,170

1217
01:24:49,530 --> 01:24:54,590

01:24:57,610 --> 01:24:59,790
And here we go again.

1221
01:25:00,010 --> 01:25:01,090
Frozen, we're frozen, guys.

1222
01:25:01,510 --> 01:25:01,930
It's killing.

1223
01:25:02,870 --> 01:25:04,510
What the fuck?

1224
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:08,940
You get a weapon.

1225
01:25:09,260 --> 01:25:09,960
You get a weapon.

1226
01:25:10,140 --> 01:25:10,440
You get a weapon.

1227
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:15,160
Oh, your friend's not doing so well.

1228
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:20,620
Your friend might have just got fucking shit on by the
Hawkeye.

1229
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:23,480
Oh, so did our other DPS.

1230
01:25:23,620 --> 01:25:23,980
Don't worry.

1231
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:24,940
Don't.

1232
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:28,080
Okay.

1233
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:30,480
Okay.

1234
01:25:32,380 --> 01:25:33,960
Does their mag have ult or no?

1235
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:37,420
I think you're just saving it for me.

1236
01:25:43,220 --> 01:25:45,640
Oh my god, he never missed, yes.

1237
01:25:46,660 --> 01:25:49,120
He never missed me.

1238
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:53,240
I'm sorry, buddy.

1239
01:25:55,700 --> 01:25:56,780
Where is he?

1240
01:25:57,020 --> 01:25:57,520
Where's our Luna?

1241
01:25:57,620 --> 01:25:59,700
Oh my god, try to copy my Luna.

1242
01:26:00,020 --> 01:26:00,600
She died.

1243
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:04,000
She got headshot.

1244
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:10,260
Okay, please touch.

1245
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:13,060
I'm skating as fast as I can.

1246
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:17,480
Where's the hawk guy?

1247
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:21,580
I'm about to skate.

1248
01:26:21,860 --> 01:26:22,120
It's okay.

1249
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:22,600
It's okay.

1250
01:26:22,620 --> 01:26:23,400
He can't get me.

1251
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:23,820
He can't.

1252
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:28,140
He got me in the end.

1253
01:26:28,380 --> 01:26:29,740
He got me in the end.

1254
01:26:32,540 --> 01:26:34,580
Bro, he had to jump.

1255
01:26:34,980 --> 01:26:37,040
He actually had to jump.

1256
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:38,360
Look, dude.

1257
01:26:38,940 --> 01:26:40,440
Bro, he was trying so hard.

1258
01:26:40,460 --> 01:27:02,380
hard oh if I did get here it'd be fucking cool yeah you saw
us I knew he was gonna fucking try and get me that's

1259
01:27:02,380 --> 01:27:12,540
unfortunate you know what you know what I'm I'm going
Raccoon.

1260
01:27:14,260 --> 01:27:15,640
I have a smaller hitbox.

1261
01:27:16,060 --> 01:27:19,780
I have...

1262
01:27:19,780 --> 01:27:24,200
It's a smaller hitbox for the fucking Hawkeye.

1263
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:27,660
He's gotta find my head.

1264
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:35,180
Yeah, try and hit this.

1265
01:27:35,540 --> 01:27:36,300
That's right.

1266
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:37,700
Where am I, Hawkeye?

1267
01:27:38,140 --> 01:27:39,500
Try and hit this.

1268
01:27:42,540 --> 01:27:45,140
Yeah, Adam is trying to flank a lot, so we just call him
out.

1269
01:27:46,980 --> 01:27:48,540
He's trying to do something about him.

1270
01:27:49,260 --> 01:27:50,360
Is Red bigger on Rocket?

1271
01:27:50,700 --> 01:27:51,960
No, it's bigger on Jeff's, though.

1272
01:27:52,460 --> 01:27:55,520
Jeff's entire hitbox is literally his fucking body.

1273
01:28:01,940 --> 01:28:02,800
Yeah, there's no way.

1274
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:03,920
He can't get me now.

1275
01:28:05,740 --> 01:28:07,740
It's not looking so good when our Luna's MVP.

1276
01:28:12,330 --> 01:28:16,950
You know it's not looking so good when especially the Luna
is MVP.

1277
01:28:18,830 --> 01:28:27,690
rangers thank you for the twitch bravling thank you yeah

1279
01:28:40,540 --> 01:28:50,060

him right I don't know.

1280
01:28:50,180 --> 01:28:51,320
I don't do anything on the roof, I think.

1281
01:28:51,580 --> 01:28:52,080
Yeah, care.

1282
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:55,900

Oh, he doesn't have res anymore, right?

01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:01,920
Don't worry, I got you.

1285
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:04,640
Wait, where did he go?

1286
01:29:04,780 --> 01:29:05,300
There you go.

1287
01:29:05,460 --> 01:29:07,040

I'm so safe now from Hawkeye.

1290
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:12,460
Left side still.

1291
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:14,060
Can't do anything now.

1292
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:15,740
Look at that.

1293
01:29:17,020 --> 01:29:19,140

Look at that.

But I think all the really good players now are in eternity.

1322

They still have We haven't won yet guys.

1352
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:22,340
It's bro the fact that they made it so close They fucking
still took out so much time from us in a 5v6 setting

1353
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:28,040
It's not ideal.

1354
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:29,740
It's it's definitely not ideal

1355
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:39,440
It's not, not, not victory yet, guys.

1356
01:35:44,500 --> 01:35:46,360
Maybe, maybe they'll leave.

1357
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:49,740
You know, maybe they'll surrender.

1358
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:53,640
I don't even trust myself to hide in there.

1359
01:35:54,660 --> 01:35:55,460

01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:13,380
Oh my god, he saw the res.

1366
01:36:13,740 --> 01:36:17,780
I said don't let him see the res, and he saw the res, guys.

1367
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:20,540
Don't die, please.

1368
01:36:21,460 --> 01:36:23,900
Don't die, because we...

1369
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:29,900
That is very unfortunate that...

1370
01:36:40,340 --> 01:36:41,480
Get him, get him.

1371
01:36:41,700 --> 01:36:42,320
Okay, there we go.

1372
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:42,940
There we go.

1373
01:36:43,700 --> 01:36:58,340

1374
01:36:58,340 --> 01:37:13,220

1377

1378
01:37:42,980 --> 01:37:44,820
That's why he can't fly right now.

1379
01:37:48,020 --> 01:37:48,760
Agreement confirmed.

1380
01:37:49,180 --> 01:37:49,740
Thank you, Doki.

1381
01:37:50,260 --> 01:37:53,100
I will disconnect from the enemy tag team now.

1382
01:37:55,420 --> 01:37:56,420
You want it?

1383
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:01,960
There you go.

1384
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:06,000
Yeah, Loki was your fan.

1385
01:38:07,980 --> 01:38:09,280
The battle starts in five.

1386
01:38:09,720 --> 01:38:11,800
For legal reasons, I did not rig the match, guys.

1387
01:38:11,900 --> 01:38:13,880
For legal reasons, I did not fix the match.

1388
01:38:14,940 --> 01:38:17,700
There is no win trading going on.

1389
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:18,540
Like, I don't know.

1390
01:38:18,700 --> 01:38:19,660
This guy just has shitty...

1391
01:38:19,660 --> 01:38:20,520
Guys, I swear to...

1392
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:23,120
Legally, there is no win trading going on, guys.

1393
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:27,220
He just happened to DC while I was in the same game.

1394
01:38:28,860 --> 01:38:30,080
Oh, my God.

1395
01:38:30,160 --> 01:38:30,820
He's back.

1396
01:38:31,180 --> 01:38:31,620
He's one.

1397
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:34,040
So, Adam and her spawn.

1398
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:40,560
Still there, dude.

1399
01:38:40,700 --> 01:38:41,340
I'm gonna go.

1400
01:38:42,360 --> 01:38:43,940
Is he still trying to kill us?

1401
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:44,700
A frozen.

1402
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:58,080
okay okay that's fine uh-huh wink wink yeah no match fixing

1403
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:14,720
just a crazy coincidence that the happen the enemy team
someone he's seen on the enemy team and that they also

1404
01:39:14,720 --> 01:39:21,280
happen to have an Adam that was just flanking the entire
time.

1405
01:39:23,100 --> 01:39:25,520
The Adam is Adam mission.

1406
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:29,440
Oh, yeah, I'm like one game away from ranking up.

1407
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:30,540
Guys, we are not doing one more.

1408
01:39:30,680 --> 01:39:31,040
I do not.

1409
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:34,080
These games were like actual Elo terrorism there.

1410
01:39:34,460 --> 01:39:35,400

1411
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:35,980
Oh, wait.

1412
01:39:36,160 --> 01:39:36,860

1415
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:51,040
