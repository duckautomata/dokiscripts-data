3
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:09,360
So I should have asked tempo The details about is this individual seeker games or This is an individual seeker kill race.

4
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,000
So this is not gonna be a race.

5
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,680
It's gonna be a walk I mean, I default immediately to Rape, like normal, but we can play something else.

6
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,300
Well, it's a competition, so.

7
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,020
Yeah, it's a competition.

8
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,460
Yeah, yeah.

9
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,940
It's a, I mean, we're seeking though, right?

10
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,020
Yeah, we're seeking.

11
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,380
Yeah, but we're individual kill race right now.

12
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,400
I know all the rules, obviously.

13
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,900
Yeah, exactly.

14
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,600
I don't know what's happening here.

15
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,400
Yeah, no, I just found out it's individual.

16
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,420
I thought it was team because there's two secret teams.

17
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,920
I literally was like team secret going crazy.

18
00:03:43,420 --> 00:04:43,100
it's not that's not no no no don't worry it's mostly going to be you two are going to fight each other for this race i'm just going to scroll stroll around the park so our biggest thing is um we can't use recon legend no no you can't we have going on and everything else is but they can so they can be ripping like valkyrie bro just flying up yeah zoom in everywhere that's true yeah that's what i'm saying like they're probably ripping valk which makes me absolutely concerned yeah are you gonna are you gonna like follow haste and rip bulk too are you gonna play no we can't play because she's recon bro you're so again i know exactly what's going on at all times obviously i'm very tapped in right now i'm very locked you're very like yo is gino with you right now is he like standing behind you like monitoring no no he's not standing behind but he is okay so my not teammates in the office is that i'm in right now uh drum drum bud is like at the Nokia facility right now.

19
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,920
That's why we're like, how are you not locked in?

20
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,720
You were like literally at there.

21
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,120
Sorry, my bad.

22
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,360
Okay, so what are each of us playing so we don't accidentally steal someone's character?

23
00:04:59,100 --> 00:04:59,360
I'm not.

24
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,440
I think because it's a competition between us, like I think it's just you go.

25
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,480
Whoever gets it first.

26
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,140
Bro, I'm just, bro, I'm not even competition.

27
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,200
Don't do this to me.

28
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:10,900
I'm not even.

29
00:05:11,820 --> 00:06:09,500
i'm not even i just want you guys to know i have not booted up apex in a while so that's okay all you're doing is shooting people and hunting them down they can't yeah this is the thing they can't shoot you back right but you could also be playing us right now you could be like low-key yeah this could be a lot you could be uncle filling us on the pool table oh sure sure i could just be like gaslighting all of you and i have like a secret weapon i'm she's about to break out lucille and now i'm cooked guys like i'm trying to give you guys very low expectations like in blindside all of you and then you're gonna see like 80 kills from me i don't know where i got the extra 40 from but i'm gonna kill 80 players spawn farming yeah yeah i'm respawn farming too just to prove a point 80 is 80 is that's i'm now i'm scared i wasn't scared before you that's right now i'm terrified also i'm very surprised nice wig is like alive right now because he had he did a japanese tournament like a couple of

32
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:49,220
I want everybody's charity to win, but there can only be one winner for the charity.

33
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,920
That's messed up.

34
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,620
That's messed up.

35
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,900
Temples should just give us all win.

36
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,000
Temples just change the rules and make this a team thing.

37
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,460
That's what I was used to me.

38
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,440
There's no other rules for us, right, as seekers.

39
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,040
No, no.

40
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,840
It's literally whoever gets the most kills.

41
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,280
Say less.

42
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,540
Yeah, so anyway, guys, like I said, please don't.

43
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:54,220
please don't judge me because please because it's guys what guns are strong i should ask that actually oh my god i i would aim them first person in so long i was like my manager is like you should put up apex just to practice but then i had like the street fighting thing and then i had all the other stuff going on so i'm just like oh no i should have put it this game and actually I'd even go to the training training room I just went like the practice range I just went straight into this custom lobby

44
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:13,820
oh my god like I was so tired do not perceive me chat everyone's gonna run around and then they're cut to me and they're like Jokey Bird was zero killings.

45
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,720
And I'm like, stop!

46
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:15,880

Stop!

49
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,700
You're gonna watch like 20 people run away from me and I'm like, please don't do this.

50
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,600
But yeah, I'm doing that.

51
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:41,100
Guys, I was playing a fighting game the last week, guys.

52
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,580
My hands are not aiming today.

53
00:09:46,880 --> 00:11:23,180
don't you 100% watch guys what do you mean of course I have I I obsess over one game and then I move on to the next like it's always been like this for the end of time I obsess over one game and then move to the next like my brain has no capacity for more than one game at a time oh my god yeah i was punched out using my fists guys what if okay what if i like mess with people and just start punching people and then they'll be like whoa whoa whoa bro i'm tired i am i like passed out and i woke up at 10 a.m yeah shh we don't talk about rivals guys i can't talk about it like not in front of the not in front of not in front of nokia not in front of nokia guys anyway huge shout out to tempo for uh for inviting me to this tournament i was like bro you're hosting a hat and see can i join and you want to be seekers and i assume it was a team thing i was like sure buddy and but yeah it's for the wi-fi um it's for like uh remember the last nokia hodansi tournament i joined um yeah but we have a

55
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,300
I'm scared.

56
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:18,620
Because I was like, no matter what happens, my team's got my back.

57
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,300
And then I realized the team is only me.

58
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,640
And I know I do not got my back.

59
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,860
I do not.

60
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:30,060
Me, myself, and I, I don't have my own back, guys.

61
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,040
Guys, my team is terrible.

62
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,320
And the team is only me.

63
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,320
But...

64
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:47,900
Uh, we're only doing, we're doing like three, three games, three games as seekers.

65
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,940
And then after that, we're doing, we're going to be, uh, we're going to be hiders after that.

66
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,540
So at least I have a team by then.

67
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,100
Yeah.

68
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,600
A team is 100% throwing.

69
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:03,480
Yeah.

70
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,480
We're just missing two people.

71
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,320
So, uh, yeah.

72
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,980
So we're just chilling.

73
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,460
We're chilling.

74
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,000
But I don't know.

75
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:15,940
It'll be fun no matter.

76
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,940
At least at that point, we're just going to enjoy the scenery.

77
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,380
It's just between a drum and moose.

78
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,200
This is going to be the hardest 1v1.

79
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,720
They think it's a...

80
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,320
They think there's three people in this competition.

81
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,920
How cute is that?

82
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,640
It's just a 1v1.

83
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,900
And then they cut to me.

84
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:36,840
And I'm just...

85
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,460
La la la.

86
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:58,980
I just hope I hope they don't notice the zero kills I I'll get my kills at the very end when the circle is closing and then I'll be like they're like oh my god don't keep it finally got a kill when everyone's just bunched up in the tiny ass zone I'm like yay

87
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:12,340
I'll wait until that I'll wait until the cat we're hurting the cattle guys when we hurt the cattle Then, then we will get our kills.

88
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,940
Yeah, I play the long game.

89
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,020
They're going to run out of ammo when it's end zone.

90
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,600
But I'll have all the ammo.

91
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:33,760
I'll have all the ammo for end zone.

92
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:38,040
Because they'll be too busy shooting air while chasing people.

93
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:40,720
I know.

94
00:14:40,800 --> 00:15:41,340

96
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:43,940
I don't know.

97
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:44,740
I'm trying to look at it.

98
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,400
No, no, we can look.

99
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,620
But they're just gonna be running around anyway.

100
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,340
No, I'm not even gonna look.

101
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,700
No, I'm gonna win without looking.

102
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,240
I'm literally not even looking at the screen right now.

103
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,440
I'm staring at all of them.

104
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,320
I'm staring at all of them.

105
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,200
I don't care.

106
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,840
Where the fuck is...

107
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,000
It's been a while, guys.

108
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,860
How crazy would it be if somebody landed at, like, Spotted Lake?

109
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,640
I'm good with that, dude.

110
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,900
There's no way.

111
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,880
Wow, who would ever think landing right beside us?

112
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,660
There's no one coming out of the...

113
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,640
Yeah, they're all on this side.

114
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:22,040
Yeah, the whole map's gonna be the other side of the map because everyone saw that we had to land it right off.

115
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,120
Alright, here we go.

Yeah, we can, but then this all fucking flew away from me.

131
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,660
I'm sick.

132
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:35,860
Woo!

133
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,020
Dude, focused audio.

134
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:37,280
I know.

135
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,860
Oh, he went through the freaking wall.

136
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,240
No, I was fucking with this guy.

137
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,300
I was like, wait, can I not shoot you yet?

138
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,460
I'm surprised you didn't choose Alter, dude.

139
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,500
Yeah, I might have been a mistake.

140
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:45,900
It's fine.

141
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,560
No, I was messing with this one guy and then he just ran away.

142
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,120
He doesn't know it's me, right?

143
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:53,420
Surely?

144
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,960
Surely this guy doesn't know that I'm a seeker.

145
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,080
Somebody's, like, gonna be up here, bro.

146
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,120
I don't think we're allowed to shoot yet.

147
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:02,380
What do you mean?

148
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,340
Oh, wait, is that real?

149
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,260
Yeah, we're not allowed to shoot yet.

150
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:06,440
Says who?

151
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,100
Says in the rules.

152
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,700
Did you guys not read the rules?

153
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,180
How long do I have to wait until the zone closes?

154
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:12,960
No.

155
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,780
I literally am about to kill a person right in front of me.

156
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,140
No, no.

157
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,200
You're waiting until you wait until the zone closes and then you shoot someone.

158
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,260
Ducky would never mislead me, right?

159
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:21,920
Of course not.

160
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,140
Why would I mislead you?

161
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,400
This is a team game.

162
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:25,940
Team effort?

163
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,100
I don't know what's going on.

164
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:28,700
Me either.

165
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,640
No, no, it's me.

166
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,360
You don't know me there.

167
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:30,840
That's true.

168
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:36,980
I didn't try to get it because he was, he and I were just chilling next to each other because we thought like, uh, we were like...

169
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,520
I'm literally just chasing this person in a circle right now, not killing me.

170
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,520
Yeah, you have to wait until the zone ends.

171
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,240
You did not know that?

172
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,180
No.

173
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,980
I can read.

174
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,420
Go check out the, go, bro, check out the rules right now.

175
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,780
Yeah, but let's check out the rules.

176
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:53,300
Yeah.

177
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,280
I'm going to do it right now.

178
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,820
Yeah, go do it right now.

179
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,280
All right.

180
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,340
Where is it?

181
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,620
I really need you to tell me because I've been chasing this altar for a year and a half.

182
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,840
Yeah, no, it's true.

183
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,660
I literally see somebody in front of me.

184
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,640
I'm just- I've been- I've been circling- Kill points.

185
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,600
Seekers will drop at the furthest point.

186
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,360
And that's it.

187
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,320
Wait, that's all it is.

188
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,300
That's all the tournament format.

189
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,180
It's in the- Did you not read?

190
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,980
It was in the tempo posted that for us.

191
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,060
Do you see the map?

192
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,140
I feel it.

193
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,180
All right, I mean, I'm just gonna wait the 40 seconds then.

194
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:42,310
I'm surely I'm getting baited, surely.

195
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:45,790
I feel like I'm getting baited too, but I'm just gonna wait 30 seconds anyway, just in case.

196
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,510
I can't even see the, oh yeah, I see it.

197
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,510
Is it when the ringing starts closing, we can do it?

198
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:49,950
Yeah.

199
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:52,250
Dude, I think she's lying, bro.

200
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:53,230
How am I lying?

201
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:56,010
I'm trying to make sure we don't get in trouble.

202
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,350
Dude, I think you're fucking lying.

203
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:00,730
How am I lying?

204
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:27,790
I think I'm gonna just land it on me and make sure you don't shoot them cuz we're not allowed to until five seconds I know where somebody is that's why I've been lurking when zone so much closing I can do it yeah yeah all right I'm killing this fool yep same three two one go by the way I was lying so I don't know why you believe me I could have been good for six years I could have been got this

205
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:33,570
I'm never trusting anything, anyone, any, ever again.

206
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:35,250
Trust is now gone.

207
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:39,370
Bro, that is, that is so evil.

208
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,050
I could be in the lead.

209
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:43,050
Don't be.

210
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,090
I'm actually sick.

You're like, yeah, what can I say?

00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,530

No, I'm not.

234
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:08,910
You guys are seeing, I've been also gaslighting the hiders as well.

Yeah, but the thing is, I'm not shooting them.

Make sure that nobody's up here, bro.

241
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,430

I'm stuck!

253
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:19,290
I don't understand why they all are scared of me.

254
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:20,430
I'm not doing anything.

255
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:21,590
Oh, hey, Moose.

Appreciate it.

261
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:29,870
Oh my god, that is so dust.

262
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:32,310
Somebody threw a horizon ult at me and I couldn't hear.

263
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,510
Why are you so scared?

264
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:34,630
I'm not gonna lie.

265
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:36,730
Dude, that was so dust.

266
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:38,570
Bro, I couldn't hear it.

267
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:39,770
Draft, brother.

268
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:40,350
That one was money.

269
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:41,730
Oh yeah, what?

270
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,850
Contact with hostile broken air.

271
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:45,290
I'm never gonna be able to catch this guy.

272
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:46,690
I'm just chilling.

273
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:47,970
I only shoot.

274
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:50,490
One of the hottest shots tried to shoot me.

275
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:51,250
I got scared.

276
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:53,330
Oh my god.

277
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:54,550
Okay, that dude's gonna get away.

278
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:55,250
He's just gonna get away.

279
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:56,230
There's nothing I can do about it.

280
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:56,870
There he is.

281
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:59,170
Yeah, but they had.

282
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:03,290
Okay, so some of the hiders have guns on their back too, so...

283
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:06,290
Yeah, let me find out.

284

Oh my god.

Well, I could participate in this race when I know I'm not even part of the race.

299
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,000
Oh, that Valkyrie's moving.

300
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:16,820
That Valkyrie's moving.

301
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,200
That Valkyrie's moving.

00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,560

Hey, buddy.

Why would you pick up?

338
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,300
He had a Krayber.

339
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:40,120
He did?

340
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,740
He didn't want us to have the Krayber.

341
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:42,360
That's why.

342
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,180
Honestly, that's lucky smart.

343
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,100
Yeah, that's smart.

344
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:46,460
He's just...

345
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:46,600
What?

346
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,060
Whoa, guys.

347
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,320

348
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:55,680
Bro.

349
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,740

351
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,540

Who are you trying to shoot?

356
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:11,840
No, they're not.

357
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,560
They're lucid, bro.

358
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,160
They got that.

359
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,020
Yeah, that's hard.

360
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:17,860
That's not the very I'm not gonna I ain't even gonna try that's a very difficult situation.

361
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,620
Oh, come here, man I'm hiding too.

362
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:28,460
I swear it's like who's here Yeah Jen Burton was actually hoed by his team.

363
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,400
That's crazy.

364
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:30,780
Oh, wait.

365
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,300
That was a different Val.

366
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,960
Dude, these altars are nuts.

367
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,140
Bro.

368
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,620
That's unfortunate.

369
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,560
Okay, just on the real, on the real, real, like just real quick.

370
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,460
No, no, no, no.

371
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,320
Moose, how many you on, bro?

372
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:46,600

00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,880

Wait, Doki's on like 30.

380
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,800
Are you guys gonna kill that path?

381

I'm sad.

384
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,360
Who's getting it?

385
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,600
There's so many Valkyries.

386
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,280
Hey, not cool, buddy.

387
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,400

God damn.

393
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,100
He could kill him if you won.

394
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,420
That vanglers would.

395
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:12,920
No!

396
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,360
Duked again by the Valks!

397
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:16,500
Wait, there's a guy right here.

398
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,760
Valks keep duking me.

399
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:18,480
Wait, wait, wait.

400
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,080

401
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:19,500
I'm clutch.

402
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:20,320
I'm clutch.

403
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,120
I'm clutch.

404
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,420
I'm clutch.

405
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,420
Oh my god.

406
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,160
This is ridiculous.

407
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:28,620
This is so silly!

408
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,220
Oh my god, bro.

409
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,540
Wait, so what happens if we die?

410
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:41,420
Um, if you don't get your skills, the chance to get all the kills.

411
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:42,840
Yeah, you don't get your skills.

412
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,440
The fact that I have assists make me sick.

413
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:46,680
Bro.

414
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,140
Oh, now I actually have to kill them.

415
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:50,660
Okay, no.

416
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:51,220
That's not good.

417
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:55,680
That's kind of nuts.

418
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,160
I'm thirsty.

419
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,840
Okay, everyone, this is...

420
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,940
They're all Valkyries!

421
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:00,760
No, I hate you.

422
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,300
What is going on?

423
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:04,540
What is going on?

424
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,460
Look at this altar, bro.

425
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,520
What am I looking at?

426
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,120
Okay, maybe I should have contributed more to this play.

427
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,560
Now there's too many people.

428
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,780
Oh my god, bro.

429
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,760
I'm just feeding them.

430
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,520
Oh my god.

431
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:24,240
Bro, a lot of people have a lot of HP, guys.

432
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,620
This is not good.

433
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,940
Oh my god, dude, that crypto has such a good play.

434
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,580
The fact that you have an infinite ammo is so cheese right now.

435
00:35:30,760 --> 00:36:01,660
the fact that you have ammo is so cheese that's the biggest either scene oh i'm i don't we're dead we're dead i don't mean who's still alive who's still alive oh we won guys whoa we won yo geez that's so crazy we did it for charity we did it look how many do you have bro 30 probably i don't know man i wasn't playing the kill i was just having fun i was playing the mental warfare.

436
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:13,060
The fact that you found an infinite ammo is the most elite strat, though, because I didn't, I was literally chasing a horizon who was behind a rock, and I looked at the care package, and it had infinite ammo when I was down to 70 bullets.

437
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,840
And I was like, wait, that's the thing now?

438
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,700
There's infinite ammo.

439
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,540
Oh my god, I should have been looking at care packages.

440
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,180
That's an elite strat right there.

441
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,760
If there's ever been one, that's it.

442
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,820
I didn't realize that was a thing.

443
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,520
Wait, how many kills did I even have?

444
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,160
I have no idea.

445
00:36:29,720 --> 00:37:13,890
It doesn't even let me see yeah me either i think like we i mean we had six guys we had 60 kills in total i don't know if that would help there is a possibility that we killed every single person in this lobby we should post a clip for that most kills in apex legends we should be an lgs 100 guys i knew i'm not winning this kill race because two of these players consistently play apex every single day to warfare like what I'm doing is to terrorize the hiding I can't believe that that was Greek

446
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:33,250
I am trying I've been informed it's also a lot of fun to terrorize like making them break their trust I just I want for a good solid so I don't know if the sound has been okay because No one has said anything.

447
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,290
I didn't know I was allowed to shoot them.

448
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:38,150
So I hope like my teammates haven't been too loud.

449
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:40,770
Have my teammates been too loud or anything?

450
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:41,910
I could lower them right now.

451
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,290
That was so sad, dude.

452
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:43,810
I don't know.

453
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:47,290
But following up that, I ran out of ammo like three times.

454
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:50,470
So I just had to look at people and like do everything I could to find ammo and it crafted.

455
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:51,370
Oh, they were loud.

456
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:52,850
Guys, why didn't y'all say anything?

457
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:55,270
Oh, I'm sorry.

458
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:56,850
They were drowning me out.

459
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:57,710
I'm sorry.

460
00:37:57,970 --> 00:37:58,530
No, that's elite.

461
00:37:58,730 --> 00:37:59,630
I've lowered them.

462
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:02,070
No, none of my sound people are awake right now.

463
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:30,410

471
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:44,180
Because now they know now they know no true

474
00:42:00,070 --> 00:43:46,690
that's crazy we both decide okay so how are they um how are they are they loud enough are they like quiet more um less quiet now they're not louder than me right i just want to make sure they're not louder than me that's all it's better do i try to lower them or keep them up better were they louder than me sorry like i i like i said like i had not a lot of not a lot of time to prep for this stream were they louder than me like before a bit a little okay okay okay that's okay i hate that i get really get like really uh peeved when like uh when like because you know it's my stream uh it's my stream i should be the loudest like you know like that that's how i perceive it it's like only i could be the loudest in my own stream but so so i gotta know i gotta know for hiding what's gonna be a little wild for the hiding part as things should be exactly exactly guys I'm having fun I'm having fun just messing with people like I said I am trying but like I know is to be right buddy um listen I

475
00:43:46,690 --> 00:44:43,810
know that pivot and that's okay i think you might like i would not reach the same level as drum and moose i just have to run um so like i'm making it fun for me you know like oh yeah you never run out mo that's actually that's actually big brain i'm not gonna lie yeah i'm making the problem is like i don't know man so many fucking balks yeah it's really just people like running out like flying around you that's the problem like anyone who's like i thought i thought altar was going to be crazy like when i was first chasing the altar that i thought i couldn't shoot shout out doki um i was like no problem tracing altars all day but it's actually not that bad but the valks are in the valk and horizon with the glider is kind of nuts yeah i was kind of just gliding on people like officially get away from it is is altar recon or not recon no altar's not recon okay not recon okay okay thanks i'm gonna play altar so they'll think i'm part of them

476
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:49,270
Guys, I'll play Alter.

477
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:50,630
They'll think I'm part of their team.

478
00:44:56,870 --> 00:45:04,410
Alter is even less suspicious than Octane.

479
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:06,830
Big break.

480
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:12,730
It's even less suspicious.

481
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,880
Oh my god, that is so...

482
00:45:20,900 --> 00:46:18,120
true the thing is my teammates playing so well so like uh am i just like you guys just hate me forever if i just scoop your legend if i'm first pick or what what oh don't worry don't worry i don't think you'll scoop my legend i i absolutely think you'll scoop it what's what happens here what's you're trying to you try to take horizon from me bro i mean when you said the words gliding on people i'm like yo that's kind of big brain like maybe you know you need some sort vertical movement you do need move you definitely need like a rate that's definitely not to play i'm gonna have to figure something else out here let's see who gets first oh i don't think you're gonna pick my character so don't worry oh my god why am i lost again i'm sick no i won't say if you literally say bro don't take it i will not say no you you take it say less say less gang say less just know i like you like a little bit less no way no way no way you can't give you permission and it hurt me after i'm gonna be like

483
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:42,040
this no don't do me like this i'm just trying to win i'm just trying to get back to the kids man i'm trying to get back yeah yeah for the kids guys for the kids for the kids everyone it's for the children it's for the children exactly do you not like charity and maybe the abandoned dogs if i went i bet you're like why did she pick up this is the laundry chance well i might have dropped 60.

484
00:46:42,320 --> 00:47:19,420
okay wait they're just gonna tell us where it's up again huh i thought we're just oh yeah the way at the end that's my assumption yeah it's my assumption but you know what they say about assuming launch pad all right there we go dang this is gonna be kind of nuts on stormpoint though okay i lowered them i lowered them but also i want to make sure you guys can hear what they're saying not be too quiet yeah but they don't there's a lot of altars though remember no guns for hatters okay but they're not gonna look at the my back one in the ship that's crazy here we go You can't even get tried in?

485
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:19,780
Fine.

486
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:22,200
Are they good now?

487
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:26,660
There's one little goober gobbler still in the ship.

488
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:30,620
I think they're just waiting for us to drop out.

489
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,980
But, like, they know where we're going to drop, though.

490
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:34,520
So, what's the point?

491
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:37,560
Yeah, but they're probably just going to, like, go to, like, Echo Station or something.

492
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,580
Not going to lie, though, the endgame was so fun.

493
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,880
Okay, now I know that Nemesis ain't it.

494
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:47,460
That was not the right gun.

495
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,420
Why is it stealing my loot, guys?

496
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:58,700
Not cool.

497
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:03,400
Hey, I heard that you're not allowed to shoot at people until...

498
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,380
No, it's now second zone.

499
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:08,540
Yeah, yeah, now you have to wait second zone.

500
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,980
You can't fight until ring three.

501
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:12,700
Yeah, ring three.

502
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:14,240
When we're hurting the cattle?

503
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:15,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

504
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:18,680
Why don't we just wait until ring three and just hurdle them all in?

505
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,680
And just honestly, that's lucky.

506
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:24,320
Yeah, we should do that for the third match.

507
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:55,340
we just hurdle them into this final zone and just start spraying whoever listens whoever gets the numbers on their favor it's up yeah what it is whoa where the where the heck is any of the he killed someone already bro good for you man hey man you guys should have just been by me i don't know why you guys are running i'm vibing meds in the big two five i'm vibing right now i'm chilling oh dude i'm an idiot bro you know I've been stacking up on meds as well

508
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:24,160
Were we allowed to use nades I forgot Yeah, we can use anything we can use anything Oh wait a minute I know what to do No, I'm scared.

509
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:26,020
That's not fearing my heart.

510
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,260
No, this is just...

511
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:28,620
No, they should be the one fearing.

512
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:29,940
I'm picking up some Nades.

513
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,360
You guys might think it's foolish, but...

514
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:33,020
I can't hear you.

515
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,340
Watch till the end game.

516
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:36,340
Oh, no, my...

517
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:42,880
Watch at end game on what I'm going to do to these people.

518
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:45,100
I'm just going to blow them up.

519
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:47,700
Honestly, maybe Fuse is the pick for end game.

520
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:48,580
Look, he...

521
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:50,120
Just rip a Fuse ulti?

522
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:51,980
Throw mad Nades everywhere?

523
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:52,780
We're cooking.

524
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,440
Oh, wait, I'm...

525
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:55,640
Oh, I know what.

526
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:55,940
I'm picking.

527
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:23,280
next my obs crashed oh oh that's not good guys we're really spread out should we get closer hey i'm not gonna stay but like when you look at the teammates you have a speed boost it'll help me run down people so easy okay yeah now this is gonna be so much harder to find people

528
00:50:30,420 --> 00:51:17,440
oh no dude my internet's just getting cooked yeah this is not the time for it to be getting cooked yeah it's a little that's a little oopsie why is that door open why is this door open because i opened it you know i'm sorry i was there but at the same time i'm i'm i'm this is my opportunity you know what i mean no it was me i was i was the one that was over there just recently i want to believe you but you know i don't think that's ever again possible ever again are you even are you even dokey is that even my real name am i just the voice is in your head you actually don't even have a third teammate i'm just delusional at this point i've lost all sense of reality it's over

529
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:31,090
don't worry guys i'm gonna start hiding infinite ammo will in fact be on this care pack i'm Infinite ammo.

530
00:51:31,330 --> 00:51:35,090
Okay, so what other things do they give you now other than infinite ammo?

531
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:36,130
Because that's wild.

532
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:38,750
There's the fast cooldown, like faster cooldown ability one.

533
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:40,410
There's the over- That's wild.

534
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:43,650
Like, you pop a cell and you slowly heal all the way up to full.

535
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:44,510
There's one that does that.

536
00:51:44,650 --> 00:51:47,050
That should be like a team perk.

537
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:48,650
Not- Yeah, one person gets it.

538
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:49,210
Everybody gets it.

539
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:51,570
Yeah, yeah, I feel like everyone should get it.

540
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:57,710
I'm just gonna start hiding.

541
00:51:58,330 --> 00:52:01,170
If I start hiding, maybe other people will hide with me.

542
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,960
Surely there's going to be some hiders coming here, right?

543
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,600
Friends shouldn't be so distant.

544
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:18,540
Surely.

545
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:21,800
Dude, where are these people?

546
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:22,420
They're so good.

547
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:22,940
I know, right?

548
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:25,980
John, you're cheating.

549
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:26,600
Confirmed.

550
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:31,540
There's no one on this side of the map that I can terrorize?

551
00:52:36,850 --> 00:52:38,290
I don't know, man.

552
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:39,870
I'm kind of just...

553
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:41,230
Dude, there's no one on this side.

554
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:48,350
I'm surprised Yeah, why are they all on that side?

555
00:52:49,210 --> 00:52:50,010
I guess it's like closer.

556
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:52,150
Oh, I guess it's because closer to us.

557
00:52:52,750 --> 00:53:03,970
That would make sense I was trying to see if there's any hide is that are drifting in I'm allowed to use redeploys, right?

558
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:09,810
Yeah, we can use we can use anything they can't use everything but we can use anything.

559
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:12,810
Our only rule is a Not teaming, I guess, right?

560
00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:16,770
I don't know why that's against the rules, but yeah.

561
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:18,730
We're going to wait and see if anybody is in here, but.

562
00:53:22,030 --> 00:53:23,550
Where are the...

563
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:24,530
I just...

564
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:30,170
I want you guys to know I just maniacally gaslit two people that make me think that I was hiding with them, and I just remember...

565
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:32,310
Oh, that's been my strat this entire time.

566
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:33,410
In cold blood.

567
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:37,450
My strat involves no deceiving.

568
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:38,710
No manipulation.

569
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:39,590
Just pure skill?

570
00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:40,790
That's so boring.

571
00:53:41,490 --> 00:53:42,570
You're so vanilla, bro.

572
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:43,050
Hey, somebody just hit this.

573
00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:43,810
Somebody just hit this thing.

574
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:46,170
I don't know why I pinged that out.

575
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:48,010
I didn't think we were gonna lie.

576
00:53:48,410 --> 00:53:49,150
Bro, good cops.

577
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:49,690
Good cops.

578
00:53:50,050 --> 00:53:50,850
On the way.

579
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:52,010
I'm pulling up.

580
00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:53,930
He doesn't know.

581
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:56,390
Wait, there's like nobody on this side.

582
00:53:56,550 --> 00:53:57,350
It's actually crazy.

583
00:53:57,810 --> 00:53:57,930
It's hard.

584
00:53:58,070 --> 00:54:00,290
I haven't seen a single person at all.

585
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:03,590
This map makes it so much harder.

586
00:54:03,970 --> 00:54:05,530
The fact that I'm not killing her though, it hurts.

587
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:06,230
It hurts inside.

588
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:07,610
Maybe?

589
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:09,250
Oh, I think they might be on this side.

590
00:54:11,390 --> 00:54:18,730
broke that enemy shield now dude they're all gone oh there's noctane over here

591

592
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:45,110
Hello there, we can hide together.

593
00:54:47,170 --> 00:54:48,450
Don't you want to hide with me?

594
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:50,710
I'm coming for you.

595
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:52,430
Moo, stop!

596
00:54:53,370 --> 00:54:55,370
Dude, I'm just trying to find one.

598
00:54:58,050 --> 00:54:59,670
Wait, Doki has like 30.

599
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:00,610
Yeah.

600
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:03,150
No.

601
00:55:03,830 --> 00:55:04,290
Oh my god.

602
00:55:04,750 --> 00:55:07,010
Operation, chat, Operation Grief Doki.

603
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:07,670
Start now.

604
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:08,510
Three seconds remain.

605
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:09,810

It's like it's hide and seek or something.

674

They're all...

675
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:37,740
They're really good at hiding.

689
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:34,980

I know who the real one is, and he just got left.

698
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:48,820
And he just got left.

699
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,240
I know who the real one is, and he just got left.

700
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:53,880
Ha!

701
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,140
I'm sorry, I had to happen to me.

702
01:01:58,840 --> 01:01:59,920
But it's for charity.

703
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:01,860
Yay, charity.

704
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:04,680

01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:16,140
Yay, charity.

710
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:17,740
I'm not gonna lie, there's somebody competing.

711
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:19,980
Bro, I'm getting cooked right now.

712
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:23,440
I have, like, almost 3k damage with four kills.

713
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:25,420
They're just alluding you, bro.

714
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:26,240
They're allusive.

715
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:28,740
Noose, I might have to come still at from you.

716
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:30,100
No.

717
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:31,360
Oh, my God, dude.

718
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:32,780
There's actually no way that he survives.

719
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:33,720
No, I got him.

720
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:37,280
Don't worry.

721
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,620
One of them was hiding here.

722
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:41,980
Oh.

723
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:43,640
Oh, they're just jumping.

724
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:45,960
Oh, she doesn't trust me.

725
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:46,740
I wonder why.

726
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:47,740
Wait, I ran so quick.

727
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:48,060
Wait.

728
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:49,560
Where'd he go?

729
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:49,980
Wait, wait.

730
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:50,660
He was just right here.

731
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:51,780
No, I just...

732
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:52,160
My goodness.

733
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:54,240
Wait.

734
01:02:54,260 --> 01:02:55,140
Wait, no, you're here.

735
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:55,480
I don't care.

736
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:56,620
You don't trust me.

737
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:57,240
I gotta take that off.

738
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:01,360
I just ran into a crypto invisible, but he...

739
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:04,260
Ah, there you are.

740
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:06,600
Ah, boom!

741
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:10,220
Wait, that was elite, which has happened on my screen.

742
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:10,840
That was crazy.

743
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:17,620
Oh, I'm sorry.

744
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,080
They're coming behind me still.

745
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:21,740
That was an elite height.

746
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:22,780
I'm not gonna lie.

747
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:27,340
Let's try to get it.

748
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:27,840
Let's try to get it.

749
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:28,460
Again.

750
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:29,560
Wait, how are you back?

751
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:30,640
Oh my god.

752
01:03:30,820 --> 01:03:32,800
How did you get rest?

753
01:03:41,970 --> 01:03:42,330
Bruh.

754
01:03:44,950 --> 01:03:47,370
My gun choice this game was just not good.

755
01:03:50,310 --> 01:03:51,690
I'm happy about my gun choice.

756
01:03:55,030 --> 01:03:56,270
Why are they so scared?

757
01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:02,870
They're just going back and forth.

758
01:04:03,250 --> 01:04:04,110
They're just going back and forth.

759
01:04:14,210 --> 01:04:20,790
I think Altair was the perfect character to play mind games because they think I'm part of the team.

760
01:04:23,170 --> 01:04:24,590
Oh, I'm just farming gaming right here.

761
01:04:24,710 --> 01:04:25,470
They got to stop Resident Evil.

762
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:26,590
They got to stop Resident Evil.

763
01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:28,330
They got to stop it.

764
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:36,620
What did you think was going to happen here?

765
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:37,440
Oh no.

766
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:39,540
Altair is such a good character.

767
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:43,780

01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:44,400

01:06:05,570 --> 01:06:07,750
Why do they never expect it's me?

777
01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:09,150
Oh.

778
01:06:11,170 --> 01:06:12,330
They keep forgetting.

779
01:06:12,530 --> 01:06:12,710
Oh, my God, bro.

780
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:16,410
Caution, my boy.

781
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:18,030
These people keep forgetting.

782
01:06:20,170 --> 01:06:20,750
I love you, Gajun.

783
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:21,910
All right, buddy.

784
01:06:24,550 --> 01:06:25,350
That's crazy.

785
01:06:25,610 --> 01:06:26,510
Look at this fast.

786
01:06:26,810 --> 01:06:27,550
I have to do a better.

787
01:06:27,570 --> 01:06:28,790
This is my only option here.

788
01:06:29,190 --> 01:06:30,370
It's my only option here.

789
01:06:30,830 --> 01:06:31,730
I'm out of ammo.

790
01:06:33,410 --> 01:06:33,710
Please.

791
01:06:35,570 --> 01:06:36,750
There we go.

792
01:06:37,490 --> 01:06:39,530
Bro, that movement ain't helping you, buddy.

793
01:06:40,890 --> 01:06:41,810
Oh my God, bro.

794
01:06:41,950 --> 01:06:43,130
I don't know what I'm supposed to do here.

795
01:06:43,610 --> 01:06:44,910
I don't even know what I can do here.

796
01:06:47,010 --> 01:06:52,930
Yeah, I'm waiting till end game for my brilliant strat Stop it.

797
01:06:52,930 --> 01:06:53,730

799
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:54,770
Oh, no, no, no.

800
01:06:54,870 --> 01:06:58,450
You were so close to dying Dude, this is nuts.

801
01:06:59,150 --> 01:06:59,150
Okay.

802
01:06:59,350 --> 01:07:04,150
It's all just bounce and ziplines How do you saw how bullets move?

803
01:07:04,570 --> 01:07:04,570
How?

804
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:17,300
You don't know how to fire jetpack.

805
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:20,940
I'm finishing it.

806
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:24,460
Is this zone closing now?

807
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:24,860
No!

808
01:07:25,060 --> 01:07:25,840
Freak you, Moo!

809
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:27,560
So I worked so hard for that one kill.

810
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:28,060
Yeah!

811
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:29,900
All right, Clara.

812
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:30,660
You gotta go.

813
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:31,660
All right.

814
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:33,460
Oh, oh, this is not good.

815
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:39,940
I'm just stuck floating.

816
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:40,900
It doesn't even be floating.

817
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:42,980
No, I'm not killing her anymore.

818
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:43,560
No, Moo!

819
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:44,200
I hate you, bro.

820
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:44,740
I hate you, bro.

821
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:46,060
I hate you, bro.

822
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:48,380
You're the only one with bullets.

823
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:50,220
I was just there.

824
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:50,560
What's that?

825
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:53,280
Okay.

826
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:53,960
Oh my god.

827
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:55,440

I'm just, I don't care about the long, I'm going to do the long game.

857
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:18,100
Wait, no.

858
01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:20,660
Wait, that, this is Connolly.

859
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:23,660

01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:24,380
Yeah, yeah.

861
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:27,820
Wait, imagine.

862
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:34,720
Costing up 20, my entire loadout would be Costing up and 20 names.

01:11:35,180 --> 01:11:37,100
I'll just, my entire, I won't even shoot people.

01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:46,420
I was hitting the foot that got stuck with.

866
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:49,080
Don't keep betraying everyone.

867
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:55,120
I told him it's time to be a superstar.

868
01:11:55,660 --> 01:11:56,340
Let's go again.

869
01:11:56,780 --> 01:11:58,040
Here we go again, buddy.

870
01:11:58,420 --> 01:11:59,880
Will Moose be first or last?

871
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:00,940
Maybe picking.

872
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:01,840
Okay.

873
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:03,960
As God, I'm going to be last again, dude.

874
01:12:04,180 --> 01:12:05,940
Like I don't know why it should surprise anybody.

875
01:12:07,220 --> 01:12:07,960
I'm not going to lie.

876
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:09,580
I'm not going to lie.

877
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:11,620
I'm not going to go for her.

878
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:15,540
I love Apex Legends.

879
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:18,420
Bro, I'm going to get Karma so hard.

880
01:12:19,780 --> 01:12:20,560
I'm just scheming.

881
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:20,700
I love Apex Legends.

882
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:22,540

No, you read what Evan said.

886
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:54,920
You literally read what Verhoel said.

887
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:58,780
I mean, that's just, that's just, that's such a, that's such a big brain play, though.

888
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:01,260
Oh, you're not expecting what I'm playing.

889
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:02,120
Bro, what?

890
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:03,560
What is this?

891
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:04,980
Oh my God.

892
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:05,860
Oh no.

893
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:07,080
No.

894
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:08,540
I'm an idiot.

895
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:09,480
I should have played Beard.

896
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:11,860
I was thinking about Emma.

897
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:12,800
Oh my God.

898
01:13:12,980 --> 01:13:15,380
Dude, that end game, you're just going to get power with the shield.

899
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:16,120
Yes.

900
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:19,660
I don't even care about the beginning of the game.

901
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:23,040
It's about the end.

902
01:13:23,420 --> 01:13:25,020
No way.

903
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:28,640
They're gonna see a caustic and they are pissed.

904
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:30,780
They're gonna see the caustic and be like, alright.

905
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:33,640
I'm waiting till the last zone.

906
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,420
I ain't participating until then.

907
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:37,240
That's all you need to do.

908
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:37,540
Yeah.

909
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:38,700
That's all you need to do.

910
01:13:38,980 --> 01:13:39,520
That's crazy.

911
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:41,780
I'm assuming they're gonna- Santa's coming.

912
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:43,720
I know who's been nodding.

913
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:46,040
Boundary, Atmos.

914
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:48,960
It's about sending a message.

915
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:49,920
Yeah.

916
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:53,860
Christmas, this game really.

917
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:00,600
Let's go, baby.

918
01:14:02,740 --> 01:14:04,540
Guys, how many barrels can I have up again?

919
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:05,880
Guys, how many?

920
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:06,440
I was not smart.

921
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:09,680
I read what he said to you.

922
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:11,980
I stole his whole flow.

923
01:14:12,380 --> 01:14:14,480
I thought he was going to pick her, but you got first picks.

924
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:15,960
I was like, I'll get it.

925
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:16,800
I'll go to...

926
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,380
Who even is winning in this kill?

927
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:21,060
Like, who's winning in the lead right now between you two?

928
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:22,740
Oh, moves by far.

929
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:57,820
self-image it's 100 and you're going for a spitfire right away you freak you freak of nature you freak i'm a creature right now i'm feeling like a creature a pure freak it's over it's actually i'm feeling like a creature i love it oh my this guy's despicable okay stop picking up med drum that's really dumb very dumb of you don't be don't be doing a lot i'll be doing a lot I'm just going to camp one of these things and just grab ammo as much as I possibly can.

930
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:00,620
I have everything I need.

931
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:01,980
I don't even need...

932
01:15:01,980 --> 01:15:03,980
I don't think I even need a second gun, technically.

933
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:07,620
I don't know if you even need to shoot a bullet.

934
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:09,840
I don't even think I need a shoot a bullet.

935
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:11,540
You don't even need to shoot a singular bullet.

936
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:12,220
This is so fun.

937
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:14,980
I need a better bag.

938
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:21,240
Let it be known that I do, in fact, have two Spitfires, not just one.

939
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:22,280
Oh, my.

940
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:23,300
I went with...

941
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:54,900
damn that's crazy bro unreal it is nice stacking way more ammo though i am a creature today i can't wait to hide though i'm kind of excited to hide i didn't yeah me too i feel kind of like jealous of the people who get to hide right now i do not feel jealous and so hectic i do not feel just jealous of them while i'm doing to them yeah well this game for sure that's pretty rude I like tricked up Bangalore,

942
01:15:55,060 --> 01:15:57,960
we chilled, and then I took out two arc stars and stuck her.

943
01:15:58,020 --> 01:15:59,640
I think .

944
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:00,960
Yeah, you're a demon type.

945
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:01,540
You're a demon type.

946
01:16:02,540 --> 01:16:03,060
You're moving different.

947
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:04,600
You're a dickhead, dude.

948
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:08,060
That's what I'm saying.

949
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:11,860
I don't want to be hiding what I'm doing to these people.

950
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:15,480
I'll do whatever for charity at this point.

951
01:16:15,660 --> 01:16:16,220
I'll do whatever.

952
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:17,080
Yeah.

953
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:18,440
If that means you almost go back.

954
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:22,500
Like I know I'm not winning the kill race, but I'm winning the mental warfare.

955
01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:26,000
Just playing psychological warfare.

956
01:16:26,020 --> 01:16:26,260
Yeah.

957
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:28,080
That's the real W.

958
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:29,120
That's the real win.

959
01:16:29,260 --> 01:16:29,920
That's the true win.

960
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:32,620
I'm out.

961
01:16:32,940 --> 01:16:33,820
Later, nerds.

962
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:34,740
Anybody want that?

963
01:16:35,060 --> 01:16:36,240
This is the completely wrong direction.

964
01:16:40,020 --> 01:16:41,440
Oh my god, guys.

965
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:47,140
If I put two ultimate excels, I throw it once and then I can, I'll alt excel, waiting.

966
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:50,780
I'll alt excel in a horizon alt and throw another alt down.

967
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:53,280
I do it for the night.

968
01:16:53,320 --> 01:17:21,220

970
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:24,560

971
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:25,820
Yeah, she's just caught a stray.

972
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:26,820
Sorry.

973
01:18:26,980 --> 01:18:34,040
I say my teammates can get me to purple But I am in fact finding I'm waiting for my teammates to get me purple.

974
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:38,760
I also need a better backpack too I don't yet people is crazy this early.

975
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:40,500
Hey guys, can you ping me a purple backpack?

976
01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:55,080
This is very important Yeah, I need a purple backpack guys I got you there you go Got extra supplies here.

977
01:18:55,620 --> 01:18:57,280
A prepared soldier is a living soldier.

978
01:18:57,460 --> 01:18:58,800
I guess the purple back.

979
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:01,020
Yeah, chat, we're swapping after this game.

980
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:03,200
So we have three games as seekers and three games as hiders.

981
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:05,540
Yeah, I'm stoked to be able to hide.

982
01:19:05,660 --> 01:19:06,220
It's going to be sick.

983
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:09,360
I feel like I'm going to get carbon so hard as hider.

984
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:12,340
I wonder how they do points.

985
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:13,880
That's a great way.

986
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:18,800
It's like the longer you last, I think, like whichever placement your hider team gets.

987
01:19:20,540 --> 01:19:22,240
Because the hider is the team game.

988
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:28,540
See, like now again, like that sounds normal, but I still don't trust you from right now.

989
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:30,420
No, that's the actual rule.

990
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:33,400
Don't worry, I'm gaslighting the hiders, not you guys now.

991
01:19:33,980 --> 01:19:35,020
I have new targets.

992
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,640
Oh, you could focus on someone else.

993
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:38,800
All right, that's good to know.

994
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:42,560
Are you even finding people?

995
01:19:42,780 --> 01:19:43,680
Also, can you guys ping me?

996
01:19:43,740 --> 01:19:53,300
I'm finding them, I'm finding them like over, over in the quarantine zone, but they're all kind of meandering away from me, which I guess is the name of the game.

997
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:56,520
But yeah, I think it's because you have a gun on your back.

998
01:19:56,940 --> 01:20:05,220
Maybe Maybe you like throw away your gun because I'm shooting bullets at people that might yeah, yeah, that's very possible Yeah, yeah, I think you got to stop doing that

999
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:13,940
Oh, oh, oh, oh, but where the heck are the alt excels chat what's on my fellow?

1000
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:15,960
I've been trying to fight I don't care about these people.

1001
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:16,300
Oh, wait.

1002
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:17,080
Hey, I need that actually.

1003
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:24,400
I don't care about like the people around me This is I need an alt Excel you're so fearful You have nothing but fear in your heart.

1004
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:25,040

1005
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:31,220
I'm not here to kill people now.

1006
01:20:31,540 --> 01:20:32,260
Oh, wait, unless.

1007
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:38,500
Eh.

1008
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:48,140
I can't marinate this person because he knows.

1009
01:20:49,940 --> 01:20:50,740
This sucks.

1010
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:53,420

I'll kill you if you have a purple backpack, bro.

1014
01:20:58,380 --> 01:20:59,600
Thumbos got to go down.

1015
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:01,160
For the kids.

1016
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:03,040
Look at this.

1017
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:04,460
I'm here for the purple backpack.

01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:05,540

1019
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:08,000

01:21:08,740 --> 01:21:09,760
Got to go, got to go.

1021
01:21:10,060 --> 01:21:11,240
Somebody had to do it.

01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:12,000
Somebody.

1023
01:21:12,140 --> 01:21:12,900

1024
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:14,480
I need to look for loot.

1025
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:19,320
Like, my plan needs the proper loot for this, and I don't have the proper loot yet.

1026
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:21,740
I'm not here for the kills now.

1027
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,660

Three?

1032
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:00,040
I think I've counted three.

1033
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:00,520
Maybe four.

1034
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:01,300
I'm only at three, brother.

1035
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:02,980
I'm only at three.

1036
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:06,000
I'm assuming 15.

1037
01:22:06,180 --> 01:22:06,940
And I'm being gaslit.

1038
01:22:07,220 --> 01:22:08,780
I have no trust in this team right now.

1039
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:09,220
Zero.

1040
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:10,600
You should just have no trust in me.

1041
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:12,620
I don't know why you're bringing Moose into this.

1042
01:22:14,260 --> 01:22:15,180
I'm glad that you admit it.

1043
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,540
Yeah, it's like, why are you bringing Moose into this?

1044
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:19,400

01:22:20,420 --> 01:22:21,760
Ikey, Ikey, Ikey.

01:22:25,260 --> 01:22:26,220
You're not a moose.

1047
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:34,520
I can't believe I still haven't found a backpack, guys.

1048
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:35,380
It's crazy.

1049
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:40,880
I've just been, like, trying to find old excels and backpacks.

1050
01:22:41,060 --> 01:22:42,460
That was been the entire plan.

1051
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:49,790
Oh, dude, where is this?

1052
01:22:51,980 --> 01:22:52,200

Jesus, where are the Alt-Exceles?

1059

I mean, I'll take that.

1062
01:24:44,530 --> 01:24:45,890
I feel so poor.

1063
01:24:50,710 --> 01:24:53,390
Yo, this Crypto just honed.

01:24:54,430 --> 01:24:55,430
He's so bad.

1065
01:24:55,970 --> 01:24:59,570
Bro, I feel like the hodders are taking all the Alt-Excel because they know my plan.

1066
01:24:59,650 --> 01:25:00,750
They're like, we can't give them.

1067

Guys, you know I don't read.

I've been, like, trying to find all the cells this whole time.

1073
01:25:59,090 --> 01:25:59,810
It's time.

1074
01:26:26,890 --> 01:26:28,260
There's a trap.

1075
01:26:42,980 --> 01:26:46,080

Not a huge dirtball.

Oh, they could just go top or bottom.

01:27:49,370 --> 01:27:50,070
That's the worst part.

1088
01:27:50,850 --> 01:27:53,770

Yeah, no one picking your body up, buddy.

1105
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:05,110
Oh, you gotta go.

1106
01:29:05,210 --> 01:29:05,870
You gotta go, Jack.

1107
01:29:06,670 --> 01:29:06,930
Caution!

1108
01:29:12,060 --> 01:29:13,980
Oh, wait, no, this is the perfect end zone.

1109
01:29:14,180 --> 01:29:16,020
This is the perfect end zone for me.

1110
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:17,540
No, I'm getting distracted!

1111
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:19,120
I'm getting distracted!

1112
01:29:19,340 --> 01:29:20,220
There's too many of them!

1113
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:24,060
It's time.

1114
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:26,840
It's time.

1115
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:36,660
many of them oh my god these guys are nuts their movement is so good they're so good

1116
01:29:47,350 --> 01:29:54,890
oh five right and the naughty list is very long

1117
01:29:59,780 --> 01:30:01,820
this is a long naughty list

1118
01:30:05,420 --> 01:30:06,580
I gotta catch up to Moose.

1119
01:30:07,160 --> 01:30:10,080
I think Mandy just hones somebody so hard.

1120
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:11,020
And waiting.

1121
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:20,140
What is he doing?

1122
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:23,920
Oh, I need to save my gas.

1123
01:30:24,700 --> 01:30:25,720
Oh, I can have eight?

1124
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:29,400
Oh, I can have eight?

1125
01:30:32,740 --> 01:30:33,980
That's a crazy spot, dude.

1126
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,280
There's a Valkyrie doing something crazy.

1127
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:37,340
Dude, they're all doing crazy stuff, bro.

1128
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:39,040
That Valkyrie is doing something crazy.

1129
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:43,300
I'm getting up with some devious work over here.

1130
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:44,120
I can't lie to you.

1131
01:30:47,990 --> 01:30:49,470
Dude, I have 10, so I don't know.

1132
01:30:49,790 --> 01:30:50,350
You're 5.

1133
01:30:50,750 --> 01:30:51,850
I'm only at 11, bro.

1134
01:30:56,610 --> 01:30:58,990
Guys, how many do I have left on the screen?

1135
01:30:59,790 --> 01:31:01,150
Those guys are cracked.

1136
01:31:01,850 --> 01:31:04,330
How many do I have left on the screen, guys?

1137
01:31:06,550 --> 01:31:07,450
I don't know.

1138
01:31:07,950 --> 01:31:08,310
I don't know.

1139
01:31:10,890 --> 01:31:11,690
Oh, dude!

1140
01:31:12,110 --> 01:31:12,310
No!

1141
01:31:12,510 --> 01:31:14,890
You almost got that from me.

1142
01:31:17,830 --> 01:31:19,790
I'm being such a villain.

1143
01:31:22,050 --> 01:31:22,930
I am horrified.

1144
01:31:23,570 --> 01:31:24,810
Oh, wait.

1145
01:31:25,410 --> 01:31:26,470
What do you think this one, buddy?

1146
01:31:31,530 --> 01:31:34,750
Santa Claus is coming to town.

1147
01:31:36,570 --> 01:31:37,250
No.

1148
01:31:37,550 --> 01:31:39,910
Santa Claus is coming.

1149
01:31:40,890 --> 01:31:45,450
The Claus is coming to down.

1150
01:31:46,070 --> 01:31:49,270
He knows when you are heeping.

1151
01:31:49,930 --> 01:31:52,310
He knows when you are awake.

1152
01:31:53,150 --> 01:31:56,170
He knows when you're awake.

1153
01:31:56,170 --> 01:31:57,370
His name's Yikes!

1154
01:31:58,370 --> 01:31:58,690
Josh!

1155
01:32:00,150 --> 01:32:03,010
No, my boy.

1156
01:32:03,390 --> 01:32:05,350
I thought you were going to slay anyone like somebody.

1157
01:32:05,610 --> 01:32:06,190
I know.

1158
01:32:10,890 --> 01:32:13,050
It's right here.

1159
01:32:14,090 --> 01:32:15,490
It's right here.

1160
01:32:19,010 --> 01:32:21,890
Guess who has 20 names?

1161
01:32:25,550 --> 01:32:32,210
Oh my god, I got bamboozles so bad.

1162
01:32:32,970 --> 01:32:34,650
They're all in the right, oh my god, they're all in the queue.

1163
01:32:35,950 --> 01:32:40,050
Santa Claus is coming to town.

1164
01:32:40,930 --> 01:32:42,530
I'm saving it.

1165
01:32:42,590 --> 01:32:46,250
Oh, they're trying to up my traps away.

1166
01:32:46,550 --> 01:32:47,310
What is going on?

1167
01:32:47,650 --> 01:32:48,770
That's not cool.

1168
01:32:51,190 --> 01:32:52,450
Oh my goodness, bro.

1169
01:33:02,940 --> 01:33:04,280
They're all up on height.

1170
01:33:14,130 --> 01:33:15,750
I literally don't even have audio.

1171
01:33:15,870 --> 01:33:16,490
My audio went out.

1172
01:33:16,590 --> 01:33:17,250
My audio went out.

1173
01:33:17,570 --> 01:33:18,150
The game broke.

1174
01:33:18,370 --> 01:33:18,630
My audio.

1175
01:33:21,430 --> 01:33:23,190
My audio doesn't work.

1176
01:33:24,710 --> 01:33:25,790
Oh, here you gotta go, bro.

1177
01:33:29,510 --> 01:33:30,270
I'm ready.

1178
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:35,400
Oh my god.

1179
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:36,280
I'm ready.

1180
01:33:36,660 --> 01:33:37,260
What is happening?

1181
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:38,660
I don't know, man.

1182
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:45,540
I have no ammo.

1183
01:33:49,890 --> 01:33:51,110
What is going on right now?

1184
01:33:51,710 --> 01:33:52,410
I took damage.

1185
01:33:57,410 --> 01:33:58,610
They're all up in the air.

1186
01:34:00,930 --> 01:34:02,030
This is so dumb.

1187
01:34:02,450 --> 01:34:03,430
I don't even know what's happening.

1188
01:34:04,050 --> 01:34:04,950
I don't know where you're at.

1189
01:34:05,130 --> 01:34:06,150
Gotta see you, reload.

1190
01:34:06,770 --> 01:34:08,330
The worst part is boom.

1191
01:34:08,830 --> 01:34:09,670
Hold his own.

1192
01:34:10,330 --> 01:34:11,150
This is crazy.

1193
01:34:13,350 --> 01:34:15,010
I died, bro.

1194
01:34:15,910 --> 01:34:16,610
You died?

1195
01:34:17,110 --> 01:34:19,490
Yo, Donky is just raking in the kill.

1196
01:34:19,930 --> 01:34:21,070
Donky's not getting- No, wait!

1197
01:34:21,510 --> 01:34:22,610
Donky's killing me now!

1198
01:34:28,970 --> 01:34:31,090
Oh, oh my god!

1199
01:34:31,830 --> 01:34:33,050
Oh my god!

1200
01:34:33,770 --> 01:34:35,110
Oh, how many kills are you?

1201
01:34:35,130 --> 01:35:26,790
you get there i have 22 i'm like donkeys just randomly just i lost pillator at the last second what even just happened yeah the rampart was not going my way just because i got 32 kills in the end it was so long i told you it was the long time i also had seven nades that i chucked in at the end i wasn't shooting until then i got infinite ammo by the way so i didn't need to bring a stack of ammo i didn't run an ammo this time thankfully no you cooked you took out of your mind that's so funny that was crazy oh i told you guys Bro.

1202
01:35:27,990 --> 01:35:28,530
That's so good.

1203
01:35:29,070 --> 01:35:29,670
That's what that is.

1204
01:35:30,050 --> 01:35:31,230
Dude, all I saw was the feet.

1205
01:35:31,230 --> 01:35:31,770
No, the nades don't hurt.

1206
01:35:32,050 --> 01:35:34,570
Their nades don't do anything to the costing of it.

1207
01:35:34,570 --> 01:35:35,210
Death the ring.

1208
01:35:35,510 --> 01:35:36,310
Death the ring.

1209
01:35:36,650 --> 01:35:36,850
Don't.

1210
01:35:37,030 --> 01:35:37,590
Yeah.

1211
01:35:38,050 --> 01:35:43,690
Cause like I threw 20 nades and they all pushed, it pushed everyone out into the ring.

1212
01:35:44,310 --> 01:35:44,530
Yeah.

1213
01:35:45,290 --> 01:35:45,850
Yeah.

1214
01:35:45,850 --> 01:35:46,470
You cooked.

1215
01:35:46,650 --> 01:35:46,750
Yeah.

1216
01:35:47,030 --> 01:35:47,770
Absolutely cooked right there.

1217
01:35:47,930 --> 01:35:48,470
That was nothing.

1218
01:35:48,950 --> 01:35:51,270
From two to 32 kills.

1219
01:35:51,610 --> 01:35:52,170
That's great.

1220
01:35:52,870 --> 01:35:53,370
Two kills.

1221
01:35:54,210 --> 01:35:55,550
Like the last ring closing.

1222
01:35:55,550 --> 01:35:55,930
Yeah.

1223
01:35:55,930 --> 01:36:00,330

1224
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:46,420

1225
01:36:50,860 --> 01:36:56,040
i did not know that when i saw 20 nades if i knew that rb rbs

1226
01:37:04,340 --> 01:37:13,140
did they actually wait really may dissipate the gas yeah oh it's still going for a while

1227
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:30,780
all right who's playing crypto i'll rip mirage merry christmas well i'll play anything i i'm Or I could just go...

1228
01:37:30,780 --> 01:37:32,060
Or I could probably go Valp too.

1229
01:37:40,110 --> 01:37:40,250
Bro.

1230
01:37:42,050 --> 01:37:42,650
We're going...

1231
01:37:42,650 --> 01:37:43,050
Not the...

1232
01:37:43,050 --> 01:37:44,350
Oh, it was just the Barrels.

1233
01:37:44,790 --> 01:37:45,010
Aw, man.

1234
01:37:45,630 --> 01:37:47,930
If I knew that, wouldn't I have thrown 20...

1235
01:37:51,370 --> 01:37:54,830
If I knew that, I wouldn't have thrown 20 names.

1236
01:37:57,270 --> 01:37:58,590
What if I...

1237
01:37:58,590 --> 01:38:00,730
What if I go Costic just to avoid...

1238
01:38:00,730 --> 01:38:04,030
What if they play Costic, so I go Costic to avoid the cast?

1239
01:38:05,490 --> 01:38:06,810
Do you think they'll go caustic?

1240
01:38:06,830 --> 01:38:07,990
I don't think that you'd be...

1241
01:38:07,990 --> 01:38:09,790
I don't think that you'd...

1242
01:38:09,790 --> 01:38:10,950
No, you get affected.

1243
01:38:11,250 --> 01:38:12,390
You get affected by the caustic gas.

1244
01:38:12,410 --> 01:38:13,770
Wait, you get affected now?

1245
01:38:14,430 --> 01:38:18,630
Yeah, and you can't play anybody with damage when you're hiding.

1246
01:38:19,010 --> 01:38:19,630
Yeah, but I can...

1247
01:38:19,630 --> 01:38:21,970
I'm just trying to be immune to the gas.

1248
01:38:25,430 --> 01:38:26,690
Wait, we get a...

1249
01:38:26,690 --> 01:38:28,270
Oh my god!

1250
01:38:31,150 --> 01:38:32,110
As long as I don't...

1251
01:38:32,110 --> 01:38:34,850
You can play anything as long as you don't use any of the damage.

1252
01:38:34,870 --> 01:38:36,230
damage abilities.

1253
01:38:42,670 --> 01:38:44,030
But I could have taken this entire tournament.

1254
01:38:44,630 --> 01:38:50,250
Honestly, as a seeker, I could have just taken the entire tournament by just going Kossik the last three rounds.

1255
01:38:51,450 --> 01:38:54,370
But honestly, the mental warfare was so fun, though.

1256
01:38:54,770 --> 01:38:58,410
Like, each round, I'm literally the content for this tournament.

1257
01:39:01,170 --> 01:39:03,230
It's not about the race.

1258
01:39:03,650 --> 01:39:05,310
It's about the mental warfare.

1259
01:39:05,390 --> 01:39:07,270
They're all gonna remember my Kossik.

1260
01:39:11,110 --> 01:39:14,450
They're all gonna remember my caustic.

1261
01:39:17,930 --> 01:39:18,810
They're real.

1262
01:39:23,420 --> 01:39:25,380
Yeah, it got zoomed up.

1263
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:44,620
The fact that I, the fact that I went from like three kilos and then I think it's because I also nated people outside the ring, too.

1264
01:39:49,170 --> 01:39:51,710
It's always about sending a message.

1265
01:39:52,310 --> 01:39:53,630
All right, what do we play, guys?

1266
01:39:53,710 --> 01:39:54,430
What should we play?

1267
01:40:00,580 --> 01:40:03,900
Oh, 7 to 32.

1268
01:40:06,100 --> 01:40:06,740
Yeah.

1269
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:14,460
The Doki Bird Bell Curve.

1270
01:40:16,660 --> 01:40:17,860
Oh,

1271
01:40:25,820 --> 01:40:27,060
we could do bamboozle.

1272
01:40:27,420 --> 01:40:28,320
That's true.

1273
01:40:29,560 --> 01:40:33,040
Are you guys running caustic seekers?

1274
01:40:48,140 --> 01:40:50,300
Bro, I see.

1275
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:53,940
I told you the caustic PTSD.

1276
01:40:56,740 --> 01:41:17,760
guys we did this together this is a team game we did this together guys the meta has yeah i remember in like all the other hide and seek no one would play classic but we we cooked chat you you and i we both cooked the perfect the perfect strap ride and seek yeah no we're we're hiders now

1277
01:41:25,900 --> 01:41:34,980
joki got more ports that game than most teams will get the whole event I'm done like Bro

1278
01:41:41,950 --> 01:41:59,910
Alright first time hiding It's about to get real Okay okay yeah So what we play and what we play Um probably Valc for sure Okay I think I'll play Horizon Valc Horizon and then I don't know what the other one would be What like?

1279
01:42:00,110 --> 01:42:29,470
Wraith was kind of nutty like dealing with Wraith like back yeah right wasn't bad crypto was pretty good mirage is pretty good oh mirage might be a lead i'll say mirage mirage might be but i crafted the new hide and seek meta no one's played caustic before until i yeah they better whoever's the seekers they're gonna be running caustic now yeah 100 every hide and seek tournament is just gonna be caustic now oh 100 straight caustics every time a hundred percent

1280
01:42:32,760 --> 01:42:35,120
bro i bro we theory crafted

1281
01:42:39,180 --> 01:43:29,700
we theory crafted all right i think i could have won the entire charity event if i went caustic three times in a row uh but but that ain't what we are do we caused trauma to several people we got you know we had to swap it up you know first it was just hiding with the regular the regular people and then and then we we became one of them oh what are you gonna do when they show build a wall yeah i'm gonna build walls dude what are they gonna do i was on my phone looking at a trade-off or that somebody sent me.

1282
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:31,200
There's already clips.

1283
01:43:33,780 --> 01:43:42,740
Yeah, chat, I'm hitting the panic button in my one league because I have now lost four in a row because every single week one player just puts up zero.

1284
01:43:43,540 --> 01:43:47,680
Like tell me how Odunze puts up zero when the Bears are putting up 47 on the bangles.

1285
01:43:48,040 --> 01:43:48,480
Tell me how.

1286
01:43:49,460 --> 01:43:51,600
All right, if you insist.

1287
01:43:56,800 --> 01:44:29,640
Jen sent me a clip of my jinn jinn jinn sent me a clip of of what i did to him surround and he sent me the middle finger right after so we can't do anything right we literally can just no it's just hide it's hot and see you wouldn't that's great i'm gonna just sit here and tell his own and we'll see what You guys are sleeping on this meta.

1288
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:33,220
Bro, I can't look at it right now.

1289
01:44:33,300 --> 01:44:35,260
No, low key, they might think that you're the seeker.

1290
01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:37,320
You know, other people, they might think that you're the seeker.

1291
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:39,320
Bro, I think we all saw the champion.

1292
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:41,020
Oh, wait, you're right.

1293
01:44:41,160 --> 01:44:43,620
The champion screen wasn't the seekers.

1294
01:44:44,420 --> 01:44:45,640
No, it wasn't, yeah, it wasn't.

1295
01:44:46,060 --> 01:44:46,800
It's going to be locked.

1296
01:44:48,180 --> 01:44:49,420
I guess I threw it.

1297
01:44:49,900 --> 01:44:50,100
Yeah.

1298
01:44:53,080 --> 01:44:54,140
I'm actually cooked.

1299
01:44:57,180 --> 01:44:58,360
Dang, low key, spare.

1300
01:44:58,380 --> 01:44:59,320
Is a good pick, too.

1301
01:44:59,400 --> 01:45:00,920
People are hating, like, squirrel cues.

1302
01:45:03,100 --> 01:45:03,940
Ooh, that's true.

1303
01:45:04,020 --> 01:45:04,940
Where are the heels?

1304
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:06,040
Like, on Seeker.

1305
01:45:06,260 --> 01:45:06,620
You know what I mean?

1306
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:07,840
Like, you just know exactly where...

1307
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:10,340
Oh, you can't remember because we can't even play freaking recon, so never mind.

1308
01:45:10,780 --> 01:45:12,320
No, no, they can't play recon.

1309
01:45:13,180 --> 01:45:13,540
We can.

1310
01:45:13,540 --> 01:45:15,320
Oh, I guess we should grab heels now, huh?

1311
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:15,800
Yeah.

1312
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:17,160
Also, we can...

1313
01:45:18,220 --> 01:45:19,580
I'm pretty sure we can play recon.

1314
01:45:19,820 --> 01:45:20,700
They can't, right?

1315
01:45:21,060 --> 01:45:22,240
We can't play recon.

1316
01:45:22,360 --> 01:45:23,480
Yeah, we can play, yeah.

1317
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:24,860
I was gonna say.

1318
01:45:25,780 --> 01:45:26,820
It didn't make no sense.

1319
01:45:27,620 --> 01:45:59,160
Also, we should really have purple army no that's okay yeah let's stretch we should really grab guys we're a team now i need to remind you all that we're all a team now also where did they land they landed uh thermal on my ping guys if we find the end game i'm just gonna be like running around placing walls everywhere i mean you can oh wait i'm running towards them i should run no we're in the next beacon yeah yeah we should yeah let's just find the end game oh that's why we got you That's why you picked Rampart,

1320
01:45:59,320 --> 01:45:59,480
right?

1321
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:00,700
You're trying to find the endgame.

1322
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:01,180
Yeah, this is it.

1323
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:01,720
This is it.

1324
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:02,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1325
01:46:03,140 --> 01:46:05,260
Come here, come here, come here, come here, come here.

1326
01:46:05,680 --> 01:46:05,800
Come here, come, come, come.

1327
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:06,440
Go, go, I'm gonna hit this.

1328
01:46:06,760 --> 01:46:07,460
Oh, okay, okay, I'm gonna.

1329
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:09,300
Okay, okay, so...

1330
01:46:09,300 --> 01:46:09,800
So...

1331
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:10,760
I'm flying over to launch site.

1332
01:46:11,220 --> 01:46:13,180
Where do you guys think endgame's gonna be?

1333
01:46:13,900 --> 01:46:14,860
Practice your zone prediction.

1334
01:46:15,200 --> 01:46:15,880
Probably tree, right?

1335
01:46:16,620 --> 01:46:18,320
It's time to practice your zone prediction.

1336
01:46:19,640 --> 01:46:20,580
It's gotta be tree, yeah.

1337
01:46:20,640 --> 01:46:22,220
It's gonna be a tree, like, for sure, yeah.

1338
01:46:22,780 --> 01:46:24,840
It's probably gonna, like, am I right on that corner or something?

1339
01:46:25,100 --> 01:46:26,040
So you can come out of hiding.

1340
01:46:27,980 --> 01:46:31,160
Slowly going to thermal right now.

1341
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:33,480
What do I get?

1342
01:46:33,780 --> 01:46:34,020
Okay.

1343
01:46:37,720 --> 01:46:40,100
Alright, I'm heading the tree and I'm chilling in tree.

1344
01:46:44,820 --> 01:46:46,760
If I get shot, I get shot.

1345
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:50,660
I think it's karma for everything I've done today.

1346
01:46:57,570 --> 01:46:59,630
Guys, if I die, it's just karma.

1347
01:46:59,870 --> 01:47:01,210
Like, I deserve it.

1348
01:47:03,710 --> 01:47:07,390
If I die, I fucking deserve it.

1349
01:47:08,890 --> 01:47:12,230
It's karma for the crimes I've committed today.

1350
01:47:12,450 --> 01:47:15,790
I mean, yeah, bro, I don't even care if I die early, bro.

1351
01:47:16,450 --> 01:47:18,890
What I did was absolutely horrible.

1352
01:47:19,490 --> 01:47:26,910
Like, I don't think anyone ever played caustic before in Highland Seek until today.

1353
01:47:27,610 --> 01:47:28,670
Until today.

1354
01:47:29,590 --> 01:47:30,750
Like, as a seeker.

1355
01:47:31,450 --> 01:47:33,570
People play caustic in High, like, in Melee.

1356
01:47:33,590 --> 01:48:15,910
but no one's ever thought of a playing cost because like you know everyone was like oh we gotta run at people and get the moose kills but no one ever thinks about the end game no one we could we saw the the nade stuff and then we're like wait a minute this could get even better there's no way i'm creating new worm crimes i haven't came back to apex in so long The first thing I do is invent a war crime A war crime meta See this is why It's good that I took a break from Apex guys We got new ideas coming in

1357
01:48:24,220 --> 01:48:34,060
Oh my god We could have went Gibby Could have went Gibby too

1358
01:48:37,200 --> 01:48:45,940
Imagine Gibby ulting The last zone Oh my Oh my god I want to be a hider again.

1359
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:54,280
I- Oh, I want to be a hider.

1360
01:48:54,660 --> 01:48:58,220
We only had so many rounds that we could cook.

1361
01:48:58,820 --> 01:49:02,000
We all- write that down.

1362
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:05,740
I thought that- I didn't think that they patched the spot.

1363
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:07,440
I didn't think they patched the spot.

1364
01:49:07,860 --> 01:49:10,700
I'll grab your- Oh, you can sit it back.

1365
01:49:10,700 --> 01:49:12,140
Remember what I did for you.

1366
01:49:12,240 --> 01:49:13,340
I grabbed your banner.

1367
01:49:13,740 --> 01:49:15,860
Remember what I did for you.

1368
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:16,200
I know.

1369
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:18,200
Someone else has to rest because it ain't me.

1370
01:49:18,380 --> 01:49:18,940
Dude, listen.

1371
01:49:19,580 --> 01:49:21,680
I thought you could lay there.

1372
01:49:22,120 --> 01:49:23,180
I thought you could sit there.

1373
01:49:25,480 --> 01:49:26,020
Oh, God.

1374
01:49:26,280 --> 01:49:29,320
Now there's a giant beacon telling the freaking cheaters.

1375
01:49:30,060 --> 01:49:30,320
Yep.

1376
01:49:30,420 --> 01:49:31,800
Look at what you did.

1377
01:49:32,180 --> 01:49:35,340
Not everyone's going to run here because of you.

1378
01:49:35,560 --> 01:49:36,860
And this is end zone.

1379
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:39,200
Don't worry, guys.

1380
01:49:39,380 --> 01:49:39,860
We'll be fine.

1381
01:49:39,960 --> 01:49:40,660
Where can we?

1382
01:49:40,660 --> 01:49:41,080
You know what?

1383
01:49:41,100 --> 01:49:42,760
This is karma for the crimes I've committed.

1384
01:49:42,940 --> 01:49:43,720
This is actual karma.

1385
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:48,860
This is this is karma right here.

1386
01:49:49,420 --> 01:49:52,160
It's already coming.

1387
01:49:52,980 --> 01:49:54,060
Wait, they looted my bin.

1388
01:49:54,380 --> 01:49:55,280
They looted my body.

1389
01:49:56,400 --> 01:49:57,280
Yeah, I looted your body.

1390
01:49:58,380 --> 01:49:59,940
No, I stole his meds.

1391
01:50:00,320 --> 01:50:01,620
No, I think this raid stole all.

1392
01:50:01,860 --> 01:50:03,480
Dude, they all stole my meds.

1393
01:50:04,180 --> 01:50:04,700
That's on you.

1394
01:50:04,900 --> 01:50:05,880
Shouldn't have climbed.

1395
01:50:06,040 --> 01:50:06,760
Shouldn't have climbed.

1396
01:50:07,040 --> 01:50:08,020
We're on a team!

1397
01:50:08,900 --> 01:50:10,280
Wait, where did you die from?

1398
01:50:10,420 --> 01:50:11,220
Like, back here where I'm at?

1399
01:50:11,220 --> 01:50:37,260
uh yeah dude you can't okay so you see that little like ledge underneath there you only so many secret rounds we can get i'm so sad i wish i could have played i wish we got all the secret rounds so i could have played gibby guys i am so sad imagine oh my god that would have been so good i got 32 kills i would have got like all 50 kills

1400
01:50:41,500 --> 01:51:41,920
dang i'm looking at the actual skill issue i can't i just save my life buddy i literally cannot find a good spot at all i'm just i think i think i'll be i think people will find me but that's okay guys does my outfit match does my outfit match with the zone i can't even wait you're outlining for me no matter what it's like useless if it's indoors that's true but i uh but like i believed in I believe in all of us Being outside Like I was like hoping that we were all We were all going to be outside for it My greed Have no limits Winner POV Yeah where are you Wait let me let me out there I probably I'm probably definitely going to be able to see it Well I got like 10 seconds my boy Yeah just Right here and I'm scared Yeah but I don't I don't hear gunshots I'm setting up some distractions Send up some distractions Bro we show Oh my god.

1401
01:51:42,640 --> 01:51:43,240
Wait, wait.

1402
01:51:43,420 --> 01:51:43,740
Lift me up.

1403
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:44,100
Lift me up.

1404
01:51:44,220 --> 01:51:44,320
Lift me up.

1405
01:51:44,380 --> 01:51:46,360
I swear to god, you predicted the wrong zone, bro.

1406
01:51:47,660 --> 01:51:49,220
I predicted the wrong zone.

1407
01:51:49,560 --> 01:51:50,340
The possibility it moves.

1408
01:51:50,680 --> 01:51:51,540
No, you're right.

1409
01:51:51,760 --> 01:51:53,780
Yes, this is it.

1410
01:51:54,220 --> 01:51:55,020
This is the strat.

1411
01:51:55,400 --> 01:51:55,900
This is the strat.

1412
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:56,780
What is the strat?

1413
01:51:57,060 --> 01:51:57,260
The strat sitting there.

1414
01:51:57,440 --> 01:51:58,960
You're so obvious, bro.

1415
01:51:59,160 --> 01:51:59,780
You're so...

1416
01:51:59,780 --> 01:52:00,480
No, no, no.

1417
01:52:00,480 --> 01:52:00,980
There's no way.

1418
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:06,960
Don't, don't, the thing is, they don't know that you pick Rampart, so no one will be, like, looking for a Rampart, you know?

1419
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:09,580
Because that's, like, the most stupid thing you can do as a hider.

1420
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:10,700
And you beat them.

1421
01:52:10,700 --> 01:53:11,700
you beat them with dumb actually no listen listen you put up well how many walls can you have about like five or something you should put just like random wall spots like along that's what i'm doing that's what that's what i did yeah yeah it's like more like in all and just pick one of the most obvious ones they'll never get apparently taxi picked up a gun and killed phony but he's not a seeker of course there he goes there he goes again why would you do that bro they have some kind apparently also why the fuck are you in my spot bro we're if a secret finds us we are both we are both literally four shields i should be okay all right here we go let's see your end zone prediction if it's good or not it's gonna pull forward now watch something like here yeah we have to go all the way to the other side what if it pulls here it goes all the way to the other side there's an There is a good spot right there.

1422
01:53:11,820 --> 01:53:14,440
All right, who did the zone prediction so we could blame them?

1423
01:53:14,700 --> 01:53:16,020
Me, blame me, blame me.

1424
01:53:20,180 --> 01:53:20,460
Oh.

1425
01:53:20,660 --> 01:53:22,020
Guys, this is a brilliant plan, I think.

1426
01:53:22,040 --> 01:53:23,400
In 48 seconds.

1427
01:53:24,240 --> 01:53:27,060
In 48 seconds, we're gonna figure it out.

1428
01:53:27,620 --> 01:53:29,100
Yeah, they're like, yeah, I saw that, too.

1429
01:53:29,260 --> 01:53:30,360
I saw taxi kill people.

1430
01:53:31,260 --> 01:53:35,480
Okay, so I don't hear gunshots, so I feel like they might be on the other side of the map.

1431
01:53:39,300 --> 01:53:40,840
My little personal mischie.

1432
01:53:41,180 --> 01:53:42,440
I'm just waiting to end game to start shooting.

1433
01:53:42,460 --> 01:53:43,220
Oh, Clary's got a kill.

1434
01:53:43,420 --> 01:53:44,680
Never mind.

1435
01:53:44,820 --> 01:53:46,920
No, they got like three kills so far.

1436
01:53:48,680 --> 01:53:54,240
Wait, is it like kill race overall six people or kill race overall three of us?

1437
01:53:54,240 --> 01:53:54,900
That's actually a good comment.

1438
01:53:55,020 --> 01:53:55,580
I have no idea.

1439
01:53:55,960 --> 01:53:56,420
Yeah, yeah.

You know, this is great.

1446

Listen, they, look, they're gonna live there.

1447
01:54:10,180 --> 01:54:11,440
They're gonna have no idea we're down here.

1448
01:54:11,600 --> 01:54:11,700
We're chilling.

1449
01:54:12,460 --> 01:54:13,040
Shoot them.

1450
01:54:13,180 --> 01:54:13,860
They won't look down.

1451
01:54:13,980 --> 01:54:14,460
The look up.

1452
01:54:16,100 --> 01:54:16,800
Massive zone.

1453
01:54:17,380 --> 01:54:18,660
Good zone prediction.

1454
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:19,600
Good zone prediction.

1455
01:54:20,460 --> 01:54:21,100
He made a lit up.

1456
01:54:21,220 --> 01:54:24,100
He made like an actual refugee house for everyone.

1457
01:54:24,660 --> 01:54:26,420
Like everybody is welcome.

1458
01:54:27,120 --> 01:54:27,320
Everybody is welcome.

1459
01:54:27,520 --> 01:54:29,000
He made like a fucking bunker.

1460
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:31,480
Like...

1461
01:54:31,480 --> 01:54:33,720
I gotta go, I gotta go bunker up.

1462
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:36,420
Yeah, yeah, it's like fallout right now.

1463
01:54:36,460 --> 01:54:36,600
Yeah.

1464
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:37,840
Listen.

01:54:38,260 --> 01:54:38,720
Looky, listen.

1466
01:54:38,980 --> 01:54:39,780
We have to have a strat.

1467
01:54:39,880 --> 01:54:41,000
We have this list at the moment.

1468
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:41,780
Yeah.

1469
01:54:41,780 --> 01:54:42,100
One second.

1470
01:54:42,320 --> 01:54:42,440
If we're in there.

1471
01:54:42,460 --> 01:55:04,180

1472
01:55:09,520 --> 01:55:13,780
urchin no no not gonna lie the crypto pick is Like, it is huge.

1473
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:14,620
That is a huge pick.

1474
01:55:14,820 --> 01:55:15,680
Yeah, because it's Intel.

1475
01:55:16,700 --> 01:55:24,340
But, like, it's crazy, because he was just standing in the open in front of the Seekers and we wouldn't go in invisible mode.

1476
01:55:24,680 --> 01:55:26,200
But it's like, it's not that invisible.

1477
01:55:26,900 --> 01:55:27,240
This is it.

1478
01:55:27,260 --> 01:55:28,080
It's not that invisible.

1479
01:55:28,260 --> 01:55:28,580
This is it.

1480
01:55:29,200 --> 01:55:29,980
And then they had a crypto.

1481
01:55:30,200 --> 01:55:32,580
Someone's running in a straight line and they throw their drone and you can just see them.

1482
01:55:32,620 --> 01:55:33,140
Yeah, yeah.

1483
01:55:33,240 --> 01:55:39,160
Like, I'm chasing crypto and he just goes invisible in front of me thinking, like, where did I, where did he go?

1484
01:55:39,260 --> 01:55:40,580
And I'm like, bro, what?

1485
01:55:41,580 --> 01:55:42,440

Yeah, cool it down tournament.

01:56:19,420 --> 01:56:21,160
Where are you building next?

1492
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:23,220
Bro, okay, I think you're gonna see that.

1493
01:56:23,380 --> 01:56:25,020
That's way too low.

1494
01:56:25,340 --> 01:56:26,860
They're definitely gonna see that.

1495
01:56:27,100 --> 01:56:28,000
They're not gonna see it.

1496
01:56:28,080 --> 01:56:28,740
How would they know?

1497
01:56:29,200 --> 01:56:32,880
Imagine you were the first one to get gunned down between the team.

1498
01:56:33,680 --> 01:56:35,500
This is like the best strat, I think.

1499
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:36,360
No!

1500
01:56:37,720 --> 01:56:39,300

01:56:41,920 --> 01:56:42,920

No, no, no, no, no, no.

1507
01:58:19,060 --> 01:58:21,500
I was like, what if I just stand here in the bin?

1508
01:58:21,520 --> 01:58:22,320
It's like I killed so bad.

1509
01:58:23,300 --> 01:58:24,220
No, because Mike went away.

1510
01:58:24,240 --> 01:58:25,420
Not to throw this dude's ball again.

1511
01:58:25,460 --> 01:58:26,920
No, okay, okay.

1512
01:58:27,500 --> 01:58:30,840
I was like, I was like, what if I just hide in this bin?

1513
01:58:31,240 --> 01:58:34,940
And then she was right next to me watching me hide in the bin.

1514
01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:40,500
No, this is karma for the crimes I've committed.

1515
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:43,720
This is the best spot, maybe ever.

1516
01:58:44,580 --> 01:59:16,750

1517
01:59:16,750 --> 01:59:17,930
My stats like low key work.

1518
01:59:20,610 --> 01:59:22,250
At least we're not 20th.

1519
01:59:23,670 --> 01:59:25,190
Oh my god, they have a shield as well.

1520
01:59:25,390 --> 01:59:26,190
Oh my god, wait.

1521
01:59:27,430 --> 01:59:27,930
They just break this.

1522
01:59:27,990 --> 01:59:28,330
I'm coming to you.

1523
01:59:28,470 --> 01:59:29,030
I'm coming to you.

1524
01:59:29,070 --> 01:59:30,190
Good thing you came.

1525
01:59:30,770 --> 01:59:31,190
Oh my god.

1526
01:59:31,230 --> 01:59:31,550
Oh my god.

1527
01:59:33,930 --> 01:59:34,370
Why?

1528
01:59:35,830 --> 01:59:36,270
Why?

1529
01:59:38,070 --> 01:59:39,690
Why would you do this?

1530
01:59:40,450 --> 01:59:41,230
They're coming.

1531
01:59:41,450 --> 01:59:41,990
He's coming.

1532
01:59:42,250 --> 01:59:42,830
He's coming.

1533
01:59:43,130 --> 01:59:43,730
Oh my god.

1534
01:59:44,130 --> 01:59:46,090
Why would you do this then?

1535
01:59:46,710 --> 01:59:48,090
Because I was stuck in the open.

1536
01:59:48,230 --> 01:59:48,850
I was dead.

1537
01:59:49,430 --> 01:59:51,070
Yeah, that word the whole team's dead.

1538
01:59:52,370 --> 01:59:53,070
No, no, I'm good.

1539
01:59:53,510 --> 01:59:56,070
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1540
01:59:56,070 --> 01:59:59,010
The best thing to do in situations like this is not panic.

1541
01:59:59,650 --> 02:00:01,110
Why are they not going Cossack?

1542
02:00:01,330 --> 02:00:02,370
A medic, pure fear.

1543
02:00:03,290 --> 02:00:04,430
Wait, are they on Cossack?

1544
02:00:04,530 --> 02:00:06,790
Okay, I saw Sheila, so I don't know what the other two are playing.

1545
02:00:07,070 --> 02:00:07,270
We have to move.

1546
02:00:07,390 --> 02:00:08,150
We have to move, bro.

1547
02:00:08,790 --> 02:00:09,450
I know, gang.

1548
02:00:09,610 --> 02:00:09,950
I know.

1549
02:00:11,810 --> 02:00:12,970
Can I get on top of the leaf?

1550
02:00:13,110 --> 02:00:13,350
Imagine.

1551
02:00:16,550 --> 02:00:17,330
Cauchy has a Kramer.

1552
02:00:17,770 --> 02:00:18,270
Move with me, move with me.

1553
02:00:18,310 --> 02:00:19,310
He's gonna run into ammo.

1554
02:00:19,470 --> 02:00:20,510
Come here, come here, come here.

1555
02:00:20,970 --> 02:00:21,670
Be careful this right side.

1556
02:00:21,710 --> 02:00:22,490
There was someone here on the right side.

1557
02:00:22,550 --> 02:00:24,050
I had to check something real quick.

1558
02:00:24,490 --> 02:00:24,730
Okay.

1559
02:00:25,370 --> 02:00:25,750
All right.

1560
02:00:26,870 --> 02:00:28,210
Oh my god, they have a Kramer, guys.

1561
02:00:29,530 --> 02:00:30,930
They have a Kramer, guys.

1562
02:00:31,130 --> 02:00:31,450
Be careful.

1563
02:00:31,930 --> 02:00:32,790
That's how I died.

1564
02:00:33,750 --> 02:00:34,590
Yeah, there it is.

1565
02:00:34,990 --> 02:00:38,250
Okay, you guys are moving as a pack, and that's the stupidest thing I've ever seen.

1566
02:00:39,090 --> 02:00:39,450
Like...

1567
02:00:39,450 --> 02:00:40,910
Listen, hey, death box.

1568
02:00:42,090 --> 02:00:42,790
I made it out.

1569
02:00:42,910 --> 02:00:43,430
I made it out.

1570
02:00:44,450 --> 02:00:46,230
Yeah, but there's a reason why I died.

1571
02:00:46,250 --> 02:00:47,790
I've committed some crime.

1572
02:00:53,770 --> 02:00:54,210
No.

1573
02:00:56,090 --> 02:00:57,670
Come on, run.

1574
02:01:01,690 --> 02:01:03,090
Oh, my God.

1575
02:01:03,330 --> 02:01:04,230
It's just RNG.

1576
02:01:04,690 --> 02:01:05,490
Why are you not healing?

1577
02:01:05,730 --> 02:01:06,270
Are you scared?

1578
02:01:07,030 --> 02:01:08,330
Yeah, I should be like.

1579
02:01:08,710 --> 02:01:09,050
You're so right.

1580
02:01:09,230 --> 02:01:10,730
Yeah, I was gonna say why.

1581
02:01:10,810 --> 02:01:12,710
I'm in my little hole.

1582
02:01:13,450 --> 02:01:13,810
Oh, wait.

1583
02:01:14,010 --> 02:01:14,710
What is your little...

1584
02:01:14,710 --> 02:01:16,170
You little rampant?

1585
02:01:16,250 --> 02:01:32,310
Oh my god My spot's elite my spot is elite my spot is elite.

1586
02:01:32,550 --> 02:01:35,510
Oh is he coming back Bro, he's coming back.

1587
02:01:35,510 --> 02:01:49,550
Oh I think you gotta leave the portal I'm good Never been better that looked insane on my screen Wait, they're running rampart and rave.

1588
02:01:49,770 --> 02:01:50,970
Why are they not running caustic?

1589
02:01:51,190 --> 02:01:51,630
Did they like?

1590
02:01:52,510 --> 02:01:53,330
Secretly bad.

1591
02:01:54,850 --> 02:01:59,250
Bro, are they playing for honor?

1592
02:01:59,590 --> 02:02:01,470
Like, is that why they're not doing caustic?

1593
02:02:04,310 --> 02:02:09,730
See, you guys know I like to, I abuse the most cheesable characters here.

1594
02:02:11,470 --> 02:02:13,270
I ain't about honor, guys.

1595
02:02:16,930 --> 02:02:19,470
We're not here but on it.

1596
02:02:19,870 --> 02:02:20,930
Don't freaking scare right now, man.

1597
02:02:23,950 --> 02:02:27,330
They made a Geneva convention for what I did.

1598
02:02:28,510 --> 02:02:30,270
Bro, it is play to win.

1599
02:02:30,350 --> 02:02:32,150
I got 32 kills.

1600
02:02:32,550 --> 02:02:35,490
If that's not winning, I don't know what is.

1601
02:02:38,070 --> 02:02:41,310
Yeah, I didn't sign the convention, by the way.

1602
02:02:42,810 --> 02:02:43,250
Yeah.

1603
02:02:44,390 --> 02:02:46,230
They're trying to like win the convention.

1604
02:02:46,250 --> 02:02:46,990
My skill?

1605
02:02:47,230 --> 02:02:48,310
What the fuck is that?

1606
02:02:51,950 --> 02:02:54,090
Honor doesn't bring food on the table.

1607
02:02:55,270 --> 02:02:59,650
It's all about...

1608
02:03:00,490 --> 02:03:00,850
Exactly.

1609
02:03:01,250 --> 02:03:02,750
Honor doesn't give you 32.

1610
02:03:02,930 --> 02:03:03,850
That's why I'm surprised.

1611
02:03:04,010 --> 02:03:06,970
I was like, bro, why is they not playing Gostics?

1612
02:03:07,010 --> 02:03:07,690
I play no worries.

1613
02:03:09,890 --> 02:03:10,670
I can grieve.

1614
02:03:10,810 --> 02:03:11,530
I can grieve these guys.

1615
02:03:11,690 --> 02:03:12,050
Should I grieve them?

1616
02:03:12,130 --> 02:03:12,570
Should I grieve them?

1617
02:03:12,710 --> 02:03:13,090
Do it.

1618
02:03:13,190 --> 02:03:13,730
Do it.

1619
02:03:13,750 --> 02:03:13,910
Do it.

1620
02:03:16,250 --> 02:03:17,110
Do it, do it!

1621
02:03:17,230 --> 02:03:17,690
Did you do it?

1622
02:03:18,690 --> 02:03:20,330
I did, I queued up, I queued them, I queued them.

1623
02:03:21,990 --> 02:03:23,270
It's all about you winning.

1624
02:03:23,810 --> 02:03:25,830
Oh no, Moose, you're so fucked.

1625
02:03:26,850 --> 02:03:28,930
You built a wall!

1626
02:03:29,850 --> 02:03:32,130
Bro, you built a wall!

1627
02:03:32,470 --> 02:03:34,170
See, everybody wants to play the shields.

1628
02:03:34,790 --> 02:03:35,950
Everybody wants to play my shields.

1629
02:03:36,250 --> 02:03:37,570
Super idea what happened, right?

1630
02:03:38,890 --> 02:03:40,290
Bro, you're theory crafting?

1631
02:03:40,570 --> 02:03:42,110
You're Fortniteing right now?

1632
02:03:43,530 --> 02:03:44,350
Oh, this is a God spot.

1633
02:03:44,830 --> 02:03:45,630
Bro, they have to.

1634
02:03:46,250 --> 02:03:49,630
I honestly think they have to re-invite us to be seekers after what we did.

1635
02:03:49,830 --> 02:03:50,350
I know you are.

1636
02:03:50,470 --> 02:03:51,810
Everybody wants to be with me.

1637
02:03:53,310 --> 02:03:55,210
I don't have Q for so long, bro.

1638
02:03:55,290 --> 02:03:56,290
I won't have Q for so long.

1639
02:03:57,310 --> 02:03:58,570
You gotta live.

1640
02:03:58,610 --> 02:04:00,950
You gotta live, Drum, because we need your Q.

1641
02:04:05,010 --> 02:04:05,890
Jesus Christ.

1642
02:04:06,150 --> 02:04:06,590
OMG.

1643
02:04:09,910 --> 02:04:11,610
Bro, you better be getting that.

1644
02:04:13,170 --> 02:04:16,050
Wait, do you have... Oh, suck the others off.

1645
02:04:16,250 --> 02:04:17,290
I'm so low.

1646
02:04:17,650 --> 02:04:18,130
I'm so low.

1647
02:04:20,330 --> 02:04:21,370
You're so dead.

1648
02:04:21,530 --> 02:04:22,010
Oh, eight.

1649
02:04:22,370 --> 02:04:23,110
No way.

1650
02:04:23,410 --> 02:04:24,190
Aw, eight.

1651
02:04:25,010 --> 02:04:26,150
How did people live?

1652
02:04:26,850 --> 02:04:28,210
Because they healed.

1653
02:04:28,490 --> 02:04:29,410
We did really well, though.

1654
02:04:29,770 --> 02:04:30,610
Hey, we did good.

1655
02:04:30,970 --> 02:04:31,510
Yeah, we got eight.

1656
02:04:31,650 --> 02:04:31,810
We did good.

1657
02:04:32,210 --> 02:04:32,270
Yeah.

1658
02:04:32,630 --> 02:04:35,630
The red bar was a dumb idea until everybody started hiding behind my shield.

1659
02:04:36,310 --> 02:04:37,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1660
02:04:37,650 --> 02:04:38,290
Your theory craft here.

1661
02:04:38,590 --> 02:04:38,750
You started cooking.

1662
02:04:39,570 --> 02:04:40,010
You started cooking.

1663
02:04:40,210 --> 02:04:42,650
What if I go Gibby and throw shields?

1664
02:04:43,710 --> 02:04:45,130
That is insane.

1665
02:04:47,130 --> 02:04:47,930
Insta exploded.

1666
02:04:48,010 --> 02:04:48,930
I'm not going to lie.

1667
02:04:49,850 --> 02:04:51,590
What if we just do Newcastle?

1668
02:04:52,290 --> 02:04:53,170
Oh my god, wait, you're right.

1669
02:04:53,270 --> 02:04:53,930
We should go Newcastle.

1670
02:04:54,150 --> 02:04:57,850
Okay, but the thing is, we all have to live because we can't run away from people.

1671
02:04:58,290 --> 02:05:05,970
No, but if we do Newcastle and you use your alt, is that considered like an alt that does damage?

1672
02:05:08,490 --> 02:05:09,750
We should ask that.

1673
02:05:10,430 --> 02:05:11,690
We should be like, can we?

1674
02:05:12,170 --> 02:05:14,190
We know if we say that, then they'll know.

1675
02:05:14,390 --> 02:05:16,010
I'll message Tempo privately.

1676
02:05:17,710 --> 02:05:22,050
Can we use Newcastle and use his ult?

1677
02:05:22,770 --> 02:05:25,830
Is that damage ability?

1678
02:05:33,910 --> 02:05:36,210
All right, Tempo's messaging back.

1679
02:05:37,030 --> 02:05:37,670
He's typing.

1680
02:05:42,490 --> 02:05:44,910
Oh, no Newcastle because it kills.

1681
02:05:48,210 --> 02:05:49,090
Unfortunate.

1682
02:05:57,370 --> 02:06:00,450
Oh, apparently people are punching people outside.

1683
02:06:00,530 --> 02:06:36,910
of the zone that's what i'm saying that's what i'm saying damn bro what happened what happened in game four everyone was so chill when we were seekers i don't know i don't know maybe we should have been seekers the entire time that's so funny all right no more no more rampart who am i playing not gonna lie crypto is kind of of nuts yeah the intel and the how just the big okay yeah yeah yeah

1684
02:06:46,240 --> 02:08:01,360
watch the live leak it was nuts oh wait yeah apparently taxi's team taxi the taxi win that no the taxis team won that round but he also griefs someone but he killed him with a shotgun though no yeah he really killed the phony he's not supposed to have a weapon at all yeah you should i can just go out the door and ask right now yeah god then you should find out right are they dq'd for that they shouldn't get points if they yeah people are actually mad right now that some hiders are mad it wasn't even a punch off the map you know what i mean it was a straight up pick up a gun and that's so funny that's what happened that's crazy oh people that do damage to other people get their round dq'd this includes punished punching and finishing oh they're cooked oh my god we didn't damage anyone guys no no i was just hiding behind my shields that's all i was doing bro i was just queuing around yeah yeah we just chill see we didn't commit any crime this time never not not this time yeah not this

1685
02:08:01,360 --> 02:09:07,790
time yes apparently the team so we're seven because the the the team that was yeah we went guys we went up a placement let's go we did it we're seven i think rath might be rath is gonna be sturdy rath is sturdy yeah i was i was considering rath as well heavily oh yeah oh you should make a portal and make it outside of zone like sacrifice your life to portal people outside of zone that should be the strat it's super funny what if you you like put a portal and then it kills the seeker you put portal so far away and it kills the seekers what if I'm being chased what if I'm being chased and I port somebody off the map oh that is that's good somebody literally TP'd them TP'd the seeker off the map you should do that and it was like a two man so hey I don't see where that's not in the rules um hop and see all right Alright.

1686
02:09:08,430 --> 02:09:08,790
Okay.

1687
02:09:10,030 --> 02:09:11,130
Oh my god.

1688
02:09:11,750 --> 02:09:12,430
That's crazy.

1689
02:09:13,110 --> 02:09:14,430
We should do that.

1690
02:09:15,490 --> 02:09:17,150
Rafe ash portal loot.

1691
02:09:19,110 --> 02:09:19,270
Alright.

1692
02:09:22,090 --> 02:09:30,970
Oh, apparently, apparently what you threw, because you also threw the ult, it killed a lot of people, including, you killed like some seekers, including caution.

1693
02:09:31,390 --> 02:09:32,830
Wait, my, I ult did that?

1694
02:09:32,930 --> 02:09:33,450
Yeah, yeah.

1695
02:09:33,570 --> 02:09:34,690
They're like, who was it?

1696
02:09:34,930 --> 02:09:36,770
I don't even think my ult hit the ground.

1697
02:09:37,430 --> 02:10:09,710
ended before like i read the moment i threw my oh really apparently there were two horizon ults at end zone that like sucked the seekers off into the zone i i died like that in one of our games i got pulled off in a zone that was not one of ours at all you're like are you a lad bro there's so many rule how come there's so many rule adjustments after we got off seekers i know no one stood up for us no but because we want to see us winning they don't want to see us dubbing now?

1698
02:10:10,670 --> 02:10:11,530
No, I'm just chilling.

1699
02:10:11,990 --> 02:10:12,430
It's vibes.

1700
02:10:12,730 --> 02:10:16,550
No, because we were really... We were such good seekers that no one wanted to break the rules.

1701
02:10:17,210 --> 02:10:19,050
They didn't go next door and complain.

1702
02:10:19,570 --> 02:10:21,610
Yeah, when we were secret... They did go next door and complain.

1703
02:10:21,730 --> 02:10:22,410
Give me a moment.

1704
02:10:22,610 --> 02:10:23,550
It'll be taken care of.

1705
02:10:23,990 --> 02:10:24,390
Jojo's face.

1706
02:10:25,050 --> 02:10:26,110
Give me a moment, man.

1707
02:10:26,210 --> 02:10:26,830
Give me a moment.

1708
02:10:27,470 --> 02:10:29,790
They start complaining after we're off secret.

1709
02:10:30,010 --> 02:10:30,970
That's so good, for us.

1710
02:10:31,450 --> 02:10:32,010
Where's Wraith?

1711
02:10:34,070 --> 02:10:36,390
Okay, so why did I go Gibby and give us Dome Dome?

1712
02:10:36,590 --> 02:10:37,010
Is that...

1713
02:10:37,010 --> 02:10:38,690
Is that good?

1714
02:10:39,770 --> 02:10:40,590
I'm gonna be honest.

1715
02:10:40,610 --> 02:10:41,410
I don't think so.

1716
02:10:41,930 --> 02:10:42,730
I like Mirage.

1717
02:10:43,710 --> 02:10:45,070
But you don't think it'll work?

1718
02:10:45,310 --> 02:10:50,550
You can play whoever you want, but I don't know if Jimmy Bubble is gonna help us in any way when everybody's up.

1719
02:10:51,030 --> 02:10:51,730
I'm trying it.

1720
02:10:51,810 --> 02:10:53,170
I'm trying it.

1721
02:10:53,370 --> 02:10:54,070
It's time.

1722
02:10:55,850 --> 02:10:57,190
It's time to go invisible.

1723
02:11:02,420 --> 02:11:03,600
Oh, apparently, do I have to restart?

1724
02:11:03,740 --> 02:11:04,200
I won't DC.

1725
02:11:06,500 --> 02:11:08,100
Oh, we gotta rip a scrim in the chat?

1726
02:11:08,640 --> 02:11:09,440
Is that what's happening now?

1727
02:11:10,360 --> 02:11:10,740
I don't know.

1728
02:11:10,740 --> 02:11:11,480
We're gonna rip a scrim.

1729
02:11:12,580 --> 02:11:19,940
little restart all right scrims scrims oh scrims there it is i'm gonna have some water i'll be on

1730
02:11:25,470 --> 02:11:40,150

1731
02:11:44,030 --> 02:11:46,930
It has been pretty...

1732
02:11:46,930 --> 02:11:50,290
I can't believe they wrote the Geneva Convention after what I did.

1733
02:11:50,830 --> 02:11:53,350
I'm surprised no one...

1734
02:11:53,350 --> 02:11:56,730
I'm surprised no one played Gostic after that.

1735
02:11:57,030 --> 02:12:00,070
They must have wrote the Geneva Convention.

1736
02:12:02,410 --> 02:12:06,510
I'm like, why wouldn't you play Gostic after the meta I created?

1737
02:12:10,690 --> 02:12:13,410
And I didn't sign it.

1738
02:12:16,090 --> 02:12:24,630
oh wait someone oh you guys found the clip let me see what wait okay i'm let you guys hear it too it's like really loud oh no it's starting

1739
02:12:35,120 --> 02:12:39,900
i'm not even gonna be playing that part that's the best part he doesn't even know

1740
02:12:50,320 --> 02:12:58,880
dude that guy's the dude that's the biggest part Dude, I never bought like a...

1741
02:12:59,620 --> 02:13:00,460
You think I finished her?

1742
02:13:00,480 --> 02:13:01,760
Evan, if you grab that banner, I can rest.

1743
02:13:01,940 --> 02:13:03,040
Dude, you can rest me.

1744
02:13:05,340 --> 02:13:06,060
That's good.

1745
02:13:11,220 --> 02:13:11,940
That's good.

1746
02:13:13,460 --> 02:13:15,300
Yeah, but you died to a bot, Jen.

1747
02:13:18,820 --> 02:13:19,700
Can't be that bad.

1748
02:13:19,900 --> 02:13:20,740
You died to a bot.

1749
02:13:21,020 --> 02:13:25,520
Alright, you know the inevitable highs that occurred at a W is on the horizon.

1750
02:13:27,560 --> 02:13:29,240
Okay, wait, I need to adjust.

1751
02:13:30,640 --> 02:13:30,940
All right.

1752
02:13:31,740 --> 02:13:32,580
All right.

1753
02:13:32,720 --> 02:13:33,620
Zone prediction time.

1754
02:13:33,680 --> 02:13:35,120
Time to test your zone predictions.

1755
02:13:35,360 --> 02:13:37,000
I literally have no clue.

1756
02:13:37,280 --> 02:13:39,140
It's going to be Lotus for sure.

1757
02:13:39,360 --> 02:13:40,260
No, I'm not going to lie.

1758
02:13:40,460 --> 02:13:43,160
At the bottom of Galleria is really like a crazy...

1759
02:13:43,160 --> 02:13:44,340
Blossom Drive.

1760
02:13:44,540 --> 02:13:45,200
Where is that?

1761
02:13:45,980 --> 02:13:47,220
Are they close to us?

1762
02:13:47,900 --> 02:13:49,140
No, they're on the other side of the map.

1763
02:13:49,260 --> 02:13:49,960
Oh, thank God.

1764
02:13:50,200 --> 02:13:52,360
I was like, where the heck is Blossom Drive?

1765
02:13:56,490 --> 02:13:57,850
Right next to Ocean I have.

1766
02:14:03,260 --> 02:14:05,020
God, I always want to tick the nades.

1767
02:14:07,360 --> 02:14:09,760
I have found a...

1768
02:14:09,760 --> 02:14:11,420
Oh, yeah, I put the screen up.

1769
02:14:12,060 --> 02:14:14,040
It makes me want to click...

1770
02:14:14,040 --> 02:14:15,620
Grab the nades so bad.

1771
02:14:16,980 --> 02:14:20,460
We know what tick everyone knew what I did.

1772
02:14:20,580 --> 02:14:21,880
I just can't think of that, bro.

1773
02:14:22,020 --> 02:14:23,380
I'm playing a little bit guilty.

1774
02:14:24,060 --> 02:14:24,640
I can't lie.

1775
02:14:24,860 --> 02:14:26,560
I'm playing a bit guilty right now.

1776
02:14:26,740 --> 02:14:28,280
It was my buddy's birthday last night.

1777
02:14:28,740 --> 02:14:29,020
Guilty.

1778
02:14:29,420 --> 02:14:30,900
Yeah, super guilty right now.

1779
02:14:31,060 --> 02:14:31,500
Can't lie.

1780
02:14:31,620 --> 02:14:33,920
Oh yeah, I need to deal with this.

1781
02:14:34,220 --> 02:14:34,780
I'll do it next time.

1782
02:14:34,980 --> 02:14:40,680
It's like, it's so funny, like, how many of you just rip a brew, like, middle of the day lunchtime.

1783
02:14:41,760 --> 02:14:43,220
Just go on some just good vibes.

1784
02:14:43,800 --> 02:14:45,320
Dude, you could do that in US, bro.

1785
02:14:45,560 --> 02:14:47,020
Why is that Canada specific?

1786
02:14:47,320 --> 02:14:48,040
People don't do that.

1787
02:14:48,220 --> 02:14:48,800
Middle of the work day?

1788
02:14:49,060 --> 02:14:51,300
Like, you can rest me.

1789
02:14:51,600 --> 02:14:54,340
That's us putting canisters around his body.

1790
02:14:54,640 --> 02:14:55,780
Like, no one's raising you.

1791
02:14:58,760 --> 02:15:00,140
It was a highlight.

1792
02:15:01,620 --> 02:15:31,920

1794
02:15:37,680 --> 02:15:38,980
Yeah, it'll be like, did you see it?

1795
02:15:39,200 --> 02:15:41,100
It's not really nothing at all.

1796
02:15:41,220 --> 02:15:42,480
That was a useless moment.

1797
02:15:42,560 --> 02:15:43,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1798
02:15:43,120 --> 02:15:44,720
It'll be like circled and everything.

1799
02:15:44,940 --> 02:15:46,220
It's like, did you see it?

1800
02:15:46,640 --> 02:15:47,420
I thought we were up.

1801
02:15:47,560 --> 02:15:48,060
I thought we were up.

1802
02:15:48,060 --> 02:15:48,580
We have to drop.

1803
02:15:54,100 --> 02:15:56,060
Okay, do you not have zone?

1804
02:15:56,780 --> 02:15:58,300
Crypto doesn't do zone anymore?

1805
02:15:58,780 --> 02:16:00,480
No, just for sure.

1806
02:16:02,560 --> 02:16:18,320

I like you should take it from me.

1809
02:17:05,280 --> 02:17:07,480
Not all like just like sucking cryptos, you know?

1810
02:17:07,560 --> 02:17:10,440
Yeah, okay, but like why would you die?

1811
02:17:10,640 --> 02:17:11,000
What if you die?

1812
02:17:11,800 --> 02:17:12,360
That's not what I bet.

1813
02:17:12,500 --> 02:17:12,880
Okay, true.

1814
02:17:13,020 --> 02:17:13,420
You're spinning.

1815
02:17:13,820 --> 02:17:14,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1816
02:17:14,540 --> 02:17:15,220
What if you die?

1817
02:17:16,220 --> 02:17:18,420
So you know, I don't know, you know this but you go invisible.

1818
02:17:18,740 --> 02:17:19,760
Like we can still see you.

1819
02:17:19,900 --> 02:17:21,000
I actually might be dead right now.

1820
02:17:21,080 --> 02:17:22,800
I might actually be dead right now.

1821
02:17:24,080 --> 02:17:25,140
I'm recalling my drone.

1822
02:17:27,080 --> 02:17:28,180
How could you be dead?

1823
02:17:29,300 --> 02:17:31,420
Oh no, I hear mans and I'm like the middle of the map.

1824
02:17:31,620 --> 02:17:35,640
I'm so, yeah, I kind of went over to Lotus, but I'm like super scared that they're here.

1825
02:17:36,220 --> 02:17:38,580
I feel like they're not going to be exploring every building.

1826
02:17:38,600 --> 02:17:39,800
They don't get any run down right now.

1827
02:17:40,400 --> 02:17:42,920
There's no way they're going to be exploring every building.

1828
02:17:43,060 --> 02:17:46,120
You know, I'm so confident that they're not going to be exploring every building.

1829
02:17:46,280 --> 02:17:48,040
I'm going to stand in this bathroom right now.

1830
02:17:49,420 --> 02:17:50,260
I'm sitting in this bathroom.

1831
02:17:50,580 --> 02:17:51,380
I'm going straight.

1832
02:17:51,820 --> 02:17:54,200
I'm standing in this bathroom, and I'm going to go pee.

1833
02:17:54,560 --> 02:17:55,220
I'll be right back.

1834
02:17:55,700 --> 02:17:56,200
That's valid.

1835
02:17:56,340 --> 02:17:57,180
Honestly, I respect that.

1836
02:17:57,360 --> 02:17:58,120
That's, that's, that's the key.

1837
02:17:58,120 --> 02:17:58,960
I'll be right back, guys.

1838
02:18:00,400 --> 02:18:01,240

1841
02:19:29,940 --> 02:19:30,520
Like it doesn't taste good.

1842
02:19:30,580 --> 02:19:34,020
I would drink that on a Thursday afternoon for the funs of it.

1843
02:19:34,040 --> 02:19:36,000
Pro and Medi, thank you for the super chat.

1844
02:19:36,100 --> 02:19:36,740
Thank you.

1845
02:19:36,800 --> 02:19:37,980
All right, let me check my sound.

1846
02:19:39,300 --> 02:19:42,060
Because like every time I unmute myself, my voice alert goes back down.

1847
02:19:42,060 --> 02:19:42,960
I was a hurting unit this morning, man.

1848
02:19:43,020 --> 02:19:43,820
I can't lie to you, bro.

1849
02:19:43,880 --> 02:19:44,920
I was hurting so bad.

1850
02:19:45,420 --> 02:19:45,880
All right.

1851
02:19:46,100 --> 02:19:46,980
We can just chill.

1852
02:19:47,320 --> 02:19:50,820
It wasn't so bad that I had to go pull Treg, but like I was getting close.

1853
02:19:50,920 --> 02:19:51,900
I was teetering that line.

1854
02:19:52,400 --> 02:19:53,240
That's a bad line to teeter.

1855
02:19:53,740 --> 02:19:54,340
That's tough.

1856
02:19:55,300 --> 02:19:57,280
Why are you guys grouped up?

1857
02:19:58,900 --> 02:20:29,380

1859
02:20:49,900 --> 02:21:56,920
Charity dog yeah, and I would get the drone and like show it in front of the seeker and then like take him to like the hiding spots of everyone this is this is literally you're you're a fed you're just that's what you are that's right i'm a narc bro i i get to live yeah but guess who's alive the narc for charity am i right for charity i got uh for 25 000 would you snitch on your homie and the overwhelming answer is yes 20 grand is 20 grand bro with the 20 grand i can bail the homie out honestly true i'm associated right now yeah we get 20 grand and i can bail you out it's just that easy you don't even need it look is this the real team hey are you gonna stand Are you gonna do your job?

02:21:58,600 --> 02:21:59,060
I got you.

1862
02:21:59,800 --> 02:22:01,260
I actually hit that one already.

1863
02:22:01,540 --> 02:22:02,480
I actually hit that one already.

1864
02:22:02,680 --> 02:22:03,720
Yeah, I can't even hit it.

1865
02:22:03,940 --> 02:22:06,220
I don't know if you know this, but...

1866
02:22:06,220 --> 02:22:07,300
Yeah, I think you've been...

1867
02:22:07,300 --> 02:22:08,360
You're okay there?

1868
02:22:08,720 --> 02:22:09,960
Were you spotted just now?

1869
02:22:10,160 --> 02:22:10,700
I think so.

1870
02:22:10,820 --> 02:22:11,220
I think so.

1871
02:22:11,940 --> 02:22:13,060
This is such a bad spot.

1872
02:22:13,120 --> 02:22:14,300
I gotta figure out how we're gonna get in the zone here.

1873
02:22:15,280 --> 02:22:17,120
I mean, there's a walkway right here.

1874
02:22:18,580 --> 02:22:20,960
This couldn't have been a worse zone, I think.

1875
02:22:21,620 --> 02:22:22,860
Wait, what's the zone?

1876
02:22:24,360 --> 02:22:26,080
It's probably the most open spot.

1877
02:22:26,720 --> 02:22:27,000
Oh.

1878
02:22:28,080 --> 02:22:29,780
So it's just duck hunt for them.

1879
02:22:31,080 --> 02:22:32,670
It's literally just gunning us down.

1880
02:22:36,220 --> 02:22:36,660
Oh, wait.

1881
02:22:36,800 --> 02:22:37,700
Maybe inside there?

1882
02:22:37,940 --> 02:22:38,580
Was there a spot?

1883
02:22:39,860 --> 02:22:41,840
Wait, oh, they posted the results for us.

1884
02:22:41,900 --> 02:22:42,760
Okay, I'm going to check it out.

1885
02:22:42,860 --> 02:22:43,660
If I die, it's fine.

1886
02:22:43,680 --> 02:22:44,320
They're right here.

1887
02:22:44,420 --> 02:22:44,680
They're right here.

1888
02:22:44,780 --> 02:22:45,040
That's them.

1889
02:22:45,100 --> 02:22:45,340
That's them.

1890
02:22:45,440 --> 02:22:45,600
That's them.

1891
02:22:45,680 --> 02:22:45,920
That's them.

1892
02:22:46,400 --> 02:22:48,140
I see a fucking caustic with a gun.

1893
02:22:49,180 --> 02:22:49,340
Terrified.

1894
02:22:49,640 --> 02:22:50,620
I'm going to just watch them.

1895
02:22:52,560 --> 02:22:54,120
Wait, oh, they're a caustic?

Oh, there we go.

Hey, man.

How about you never say that to me?

1903
02:23:29,700 --> 02:23:30,960
It was three.

1904
02:23:31,440 --> 02:23:32,720
I was, like, pressing four.

1905
02:23:32,820 --> 02:23:33,840
Wait, I'm going to check the results.

1906
02:23:34,940 --> 02:23:35,120
Okay.

1907
02:23:35,300 --> 02:23:36,080
I'm going to check.

1908
02:23:36,880 --> 02:23:40,080
I'm going to check what the results are.

1909
02:23:40,080 --> 02:23:41,340
I'm just looking at what happened.

1910
02:23:41,460 --> 02:23:42,200
She's just marinating.

1911
02:23:42,500 --> 02:23:43,400
In Galleria.

1912
02:23:46,120 --> 02:23:47,200
Hitting the marination.

1913
02:23:50,080 --> 02:23:50,360
Wait.

1914
02:23:51,480 --> 02:23:52,400
Yeah, I'm just chilling.

1915
02:23:53,200 --> 02:23:53,700
Oh, my gosh.

1916
02:23:53,720 --> 02:23:53,900
Wait.

1917
02:23:54,140 --> 02:23:54,940
I ain't chilling.

1918
02:23:55,080 --> 02:23:56,040
How do I get out of here?

1919
02:23:58,060 --> 02:23:59,420
But wait a minute.

1920
02:24:03,380 --> 02:24:06,020
Okay, I was like, I may or may not be chilling anymore.

1921
02:24:08,360 --> 02:24:09,420
JK, I'm just chilling.

1922
02:24:11,680 --> 02:24:13,520
That one's really up and I can like support somebody out the map.

1923
02:24:13,640 --> 02:24:13,940
That'd be cool.

1924
02:24:19,130 --> 02:24:19,990
That would be pretty cool.

1925
02:24:20,110 --> 02:24:20,610
You should do it.

1926
02:24:21,450 --> 02:24:21,910
You should do it.

1927
02:24:22,130 --> 02:24:22,670
Do it now.

1928
02:24:23,310 --> 02:24:24,530
I don't think I can though.

1929
02:24:24,710 --> 02:24:25,270
That's the thing.

1930
02:24:29,110 --> 02:24:30,070
I hear the shots.

1931
02:24:30,270 --> 02:24:30,930
Might be dead.

1932
02:24:33,090 --> 02:24:35,830
That may or may not be dead.

1933
02:24:36,050 --> 02:24:40,490
I don't know why I'm trying this hard.

1934
02:24:41,050 --> 02:24:41,510
Yeah, all right.

1935
02:24:43,410 --> 02:24:44,650
All right, I got...

1936
02:24:44,650 --> 02:24:48,770
All right, I might be the first one down because I gotta figure out how to get in the zone right now.

1937
02:24:52,570 --> 02:24:53,370
All right, guys.

1938
02:24:54,470 --> 02:24:57,890
We're saving Private Ryan and it's saving Private Doki.

1939
02:24:58,090 --> 02:24:59,190
I'm trying to save myself.

1940
02:25:02,550 --> 02:25:04,390
I think they're still on the other side of the map, bro.

1941
02:25:04,630 --> 02:25:04,790
High key.

1942
02:25:04,950 --> 02:25:06,050
We gotta figure this out.

1943
02:25:07,650 --> 02:25:08,750
You standing in front of me, dude?

1944
02:25:08,910 --> 02:25:11,010
I'm like paranoid, like right in front of me up here.

1945
02:25:11,290 --> 02:25:12,770
I hear gunshots in front of...

1946
02:25:12,770 --> 02:25:13,690
There's a pathie, but he's not...

1947
02:25:13,690 --> 02:25:15,730
I hear gunshots right in front of me, but I don't know.

1948
02:25:15,950 --> 02:25:16,630
Yeah, it's not him.

1949
02:25:16,730 --> 02:25:17,990
This is all safe people back here.

1950
02:25:18,910 --> 02:25:19,690
Oh, wait, wait.

1951
02:25:19,850 --> 02:25:19,990
What is that?

1952
02:25:22,510 --> 02:25:23,150
It's a...

1953
02:25:23,150 --> 02:25:25,010
All right, this might be the moment where I get gunned down, guys.

1954
02:25:25,310 --> 02:25:25,570
Remember me.

1955
02:25:26,470 --> 02:25:26,970
Okay, wait.

1956
02:25:27,050 --> 02:25:27,430
Look at me.

1957
02:25:27,490 --> 02:25:27,770
Listen to me.

1958
02:25:28,150 --> 02:25:29,990
This is a bloodhound with a charger.

1959
02:25:30,190 --> 02:25:31,210
Remember me, guys.

1960
02:25:32,010 --> 02:25:33,670
Chad, I might not make it.

1961
02:25:33,850 --> 02:25:35,650
I might not make it.

1962
02:25:35,950 --> 02:25:37,250
But I got purple backpack.

1963
02:25:38,050 --> 02:25:38,770
The charge rifle.

1964
02:25:42,770 --> 02:25:43,710
Oh, God, there's...

1965
02:25:43,710 --> 02:25:44,850
There's one right here.

1966
02:25:44,890 --> 02:25:45,650
There's people over there.

1967
02:25:45,670 --> 02:25:46,810
There's people over there, by the way.

1968
02:25:46,870 --> 02:25:47,530
Here's the intel.

1969
02:25:47,950 --> 02:25:50,530
I'm sitting over in my little corner, and I'm not gonna...

1970
02:25:50,530 --> 02:25:51,590
And I'm not gonna go with it.

1971
02:25:51,610 --> 02:25:52,190
Who the fuck is this?

1972
02:25:52,610 --> 02:25:54,330
He's not even shooting people right here.

1973
02:25:54,410 --> 02:25:55,490
He's just sitting in his...

1974
02:25:55,490 --> 02:25:55,950
Alright.

1975
02:25:56,770 --> 02:25:57,690
What am I looking at?

1976
02:25:57,810 --> 02:25:59,230

Oh, you're going out.

1979

Oh, there's a lot of gunshots.

1980
02:27:00,810 --> 02:27:02,250
There's a lot of gunshots, by the way.

1981
02:27:02,910 --> 02:27:05,170
I'm going to get barely in over here and just...

02:27:12,760 --> 02:27:14,560
Oh, it's getting a little scary.

1983
02:27:15,400 --> 02:27:17,040
It's getting a little spooky scary.

1984
02:27:20,360 --> 02:27:21,580
I think this is...

1985
02:27:22,760 --> 02:27:23,540
Oh, my God.

1986
02:27:24,140 --> 02:27:24,720
Oh, no.

1987
02:27:24,940 --> 02:27:25,300
No!

1988
02:27:25,880 --> 02:27:26,960
Wait, he's retreating over here!

1989
02:27:27,940 --> 02:27:29,500
Alright, so, um...

1990
02:27:29,500 --> 02:27:30,980
It got very scary.

1991
02:27:31,220 --> 02:27:32,020
Oh, they're so close to me.

1992
02:27:32,040 --> 02:27:33,260
It got very scary.

1993
02:27:35,300 --> 02:27:36,200
I'm in Viz.

1994
02:27:36,320 --> 02:27:36,320
I'm in Viz.

1995
02:27:36,320 --> 02:27:36,900
I'm in Viz right now.

1996
02:27:36,980 --> 02:27:38,120
I'm just watching with a drone.

1997
02:27:38,140 --> 02:27:38,760
Can you get her bed?

1998
02:27:39,680 --> 02:27:40,540
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1999
02:27:41,840 --> 02:27:42,460
Grab it.

2000
02:27:42,940 --> 02:27:43,940
Wait, do we have Rizzes?

2001
02:27:44,380 --> 02:27:44,600
Anyway?

2002
02:27:46,580 --> 02:27:48,340
Oh, guys, maybe...

2003
02:27:48,340 --> 02:27:49,480
They don't shoot the drones, by the way.

2004
02:27:49,600 --> 02:27:49,920
You're fine.

2005
02:27:50,060 --> 02:27:51,100
They don't shoot drones.

2006
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,260
Maybe I should have given you the mobile Rizz beacon.

2007
02:27:55,080 --> 02:27:58,740
You know, it's all good because I can't even get it in Viz right now because if I get it in Viz, I'm just dead.

2008
02:27:59,760 --> 02:28:00,660
You think they'll know?

2009
02:28:03,380 --> 02:28:07,900
Do you have if you have a wait steal someone someone steal someone's mobile res beacon.

2010
02:28:07,900 --> 02:28:12,400
Yeah, I know I'm trying to see someone put one Yeah, yeah, yeah, they this team is so scary brother.

2011
02:28:12,440 --> 02:28:15,800
So close to me Steal it.

2012
02:28:16,800 --> 02:28:17,980
Why would you do that?

2013

Why would you grief me wait no if they punch wait if they punch That's considered a DQ Apparently yeah people that do damage to other people will get their round DQ'd who did that?

2014
02:28:33,460 --> 02:28:34,140
Who did that?

2015
02:28:35,100 --> 02:28:36,540
You're DQ'd for that, for sure.

2016
02:28:38,920 --> 02:28:39,460
DQ'd right there.

2017
02:28:40,780 --> 02:28:42,240
Whoever that horizon was, Chad.

2018
02:28:42,420 --> 02:28:43,820
Yeah, whoever that, Chad, tell us.

2019
02:28:44,120 --> 02:28:45,700
I got the tempo DMs open.

2020
02:28:46,400 --> 02:28:47,620
Let's get them out of here.

2021
02:28:48,080 --> 02:28:48,840
Oh, they do that.

2022
02:28:48,960 --> 02:28:50,040
It's such insane.

2023
02:28:50,560 --> 02:28:51,320
I lived, though.

2024
02:28:51,320 --> 02:28:52,220
I lived, I lived, I lived.

2025
02:28:52,480 --> 02:28:53,300
Oh, I'm scared though.

2026
02:28:53,320 --> 02:28:54,360
I got to get in the zone, actually.

2027
02:28:54,660 --> 02:28:55,140
And they're close.

2028
02:28:55,240 --> 02:28:56,480
Yeah, this is not my, this is not the time.

2029
02:28:56,580 --> 02:28:57,300
I got to go right now.

2030
02:28:58,100 --> 02:28:58,540
I'm back.

2031
02:28:58,880 --> 02:29:02,460
Yeah, you're, you're like, ready to die.

2032
02:29:03,380 --> 02:29:04,820
This is like my only opportunity for anything.

2033
02:29:05,260 --> 02:29:07,840
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2034
02:29:07,920 --> 02:29:10,960
Okay, um, Moose, you might be the last survivor.

2035
02:29:11,320 --> 02:29:13,400
Yeah, Moose, it's all up to you.

2036
02:29:13,780 --> 02:29:15,600
All right, no, who was that guy?

2037
02:29:15,640 --> 02:29:16,680
Let's EQ them as well.

2038
02:29:16,780 --> 02:29:17,760
We're going down with...

2039
02:29:17,760 --> 02:29:18,280
EQ!

2040
02:29:18,800 --> 02:29:20,680
We'll take them down with us.

2041
02:29:22,080 --> 02:29:22,480
Dumb.

2042
02:29:23,360 --> 02:29:24,100
They may know I'm here.

2043
02:29:24,260 --> 02:29:24,880
They're not going to fin me.

2044
02:29:24,920 --> 02:29:25,700
They're not going to fin me, Moose.

2045
02:29:26,220 --> 02:29:27,840
Yeah, Moose, do the res.

2046
02:29:28,060 --> 02:29:29,160
Oh, no, they're finning.

2047
02:29:29,240 --> 02:29:29,600
They're finning.

2048
02:29:29,840 --> 02:29:31,760
That's just, that's a, that feels like a crime.

2049
02:29:33,380 --> 02:29:35,300
It's okay, Moose, I believe in you.

2050
02:29:35,980 --> 02:29:36,360
Thanks, guys.

2051
02:29:36,580 --> 02:29:37,220
I'll do my best.

2052
02:29:38,660 --> 02:29:45,980
If anything, you should find the squad and just, like, group up with them, because the seekers have to pick one, and you gotta take your chances.

2053
02:29:47,940 --> 02:29:50,100
I have a play, and it might work.

2054
02:29:55,760 --> 02:29:59,120
They're active over there, and I am in right on this bush.

2055
02:30:00,120 --> 02:30:04,000
And if nobody punches me, which has happened to Drum.

2056
02:30:05,320 --> 02:30:05,740
Twice!

2057
02:30:06,400 --> 02:30:06,840
I should be...

2058
02:30:06,860 --> 02:30:10,860
be good here i should be good punch bro that's so cringe

2059
02:30:13,980 --> 02:30:40,500
that is pretty cringe like why did he do that i want to know who it is so bad and i want to know if i'm right on my assumption okay how would he know it was you though how would he i'm gonna do some investigative reporting investigating journalism right here Live journalism happening right now.

2060
02:30:41,220 --> 02:30:41,960
Oh, no.

2061
02:30:42,120 --> 02:30:42,500
It's okay.

2062
02:30:42,740 --> 02:30:45,820
With all you guys grouped up, I like my odds.

2063
02:30:45,960 --> 02:30:49,100
They have to pick one person to shoot, and it won't be you.

2064
02:30:49,160 --> 02:30:49,600
Exactly.

2065
02:30:51,820 --> 02:30:53,420
I like my odds.

2066
02:30:54,120 --> 02:30:55,060
I like it, dude.

2067
02:30:55,460 --> 02:30:56,820
I'm sitting pretty right now.

2068
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:57,560
I'm a believer.

2069
02:30:58,120 --> 02:30:59,160
Yeah, I'm a believer.

2070
02:31:00,400 --> 02:31:01,620
You got this easy, bro.

2071
02:31:02,460 --> 02:31:03,140
Bro, look at that.

2072
02:31:03,680 --> 02:31:06,200
If anything, you got a meat shield right there, too, in front of you.

2073
02:31:07,940 --> 02:31:10,760
You gotta pick one per- Wait the fuck, he got the res?

2074
02:31:11,320 --> 02:31:13,440
He has, I heard someone get a res.

2075
02:31:14,480 --> 02:31:15,240
I heard that do.

2076
02:31:17,480 --> 02:31:23,040
I think it's bad that we have, you only have blue armor, because that's a one headshot right there.

2077
02:31:23,840 --> 02:31:24,140
Yeah.

2078
02:31:26,060 --> 02:31:27,240
You're in view of the enemy.

2079
02:31:28,060 --> 02:31:29,260
Oh no, which one?

2080
02:31:37,080 --> 02:31:38,620
Only 10 seconds left.

2081
02:31:42,750 --> 02:31:44,690
Oh, there's a lot of guns.

2082
02:31:45,010 --> 02:31:45,850
The zone is close.

2083
02:31:45,990 --> 02:31:47,030
Oh, it's end zone.

2084
02:31:49,410 --> 02:31:51,890
It's all about surviving, Mel.

2085
02:31:57,340 --> 02:31:59,140
You might need a heal soon.

2086
02:32:04,370 --> 02:32:05,530
We're just slowly.

2087
02:32:06,890 --> 02:32:07,790
The slow crawl.

2088
02:32:10,130 --> 02:32:11,490
The very, very slow crawl.

2089
02:32:13,250 --> 02:32:14,710
This is the true strat.

2090
02:32:14,730 --> 02:32:16,590
My strat is I got to set a port.

2091
02:32:17,390 --> 02:32:18,750
Probably I like the 15.

2092
02:32:18,770 --> 02:32:48,430
second mark or actually maybe I'll start loading it up at the 45 second mark wait where are you putting the port right at the right at the end zone oh so it'll take people outside the zone is that the strat oh my god you're absolutely wild for that look at that back side corner oh yeah you can just get in that room a hot minute oh my god

2093
02:32:51,590 --> 02:32:54,470
Around the world around the world.

2094
02:32:54,750 --> 02:32:55,570
Oh, it's a caustic.

2095
02:32:56,110 --> 02:33:06,190
Oh, they someone decided to leave a convention Oh my god, they know what their plan is It's gonna go away like in like 30.

2096
02:33:06,570 --> 02:33:08,530
Yeah, well, it's 20 seconds left though.

2097
02:33:08,630 --> 02:33:14,290
I didn't realize I can't see it because all I see is Jerome's detected on it Bro, this is actual screen clip.

2098
02:33:14,910 --> 02:33:15,130
Yes.

2099
02:33:15,410 --> 02:33:15,410
Yes.

2100
02:33:15,630 --> 02:33:15,630
Yes.

2101
02:33:15,930 --> 02:33:15,930
Yes.

2102
02:33:16,090 --> 02:33:16,090
Yes.

2103
02:33:16,790 --> 02:33:17,210
You're chilling.

2104
02:33:17,410 --> 02:33:21,770
You're chilling What am I looking at?

2105
02:33:23,070 --> 02:33:24,710
Wait, when does the portal end though?

2106
02:33:25,290 --> 02:33:29,150
He has like probably like 15 more seconds on it.

2107
02:33:30,170 --> 02:33:30,890
A lot of people are.

2108
02:33:30,990 --> 02:33:32,330
A lot of people are doing what you did.

2109
02:33:33,310 --> 02:33:35,230
Oh my god, they're literally on you.

2110
02:33:36,690 --> 02:33:37,570
Oh my god.

2111
02:33:38,150 --> 02:33:39,250
Oh my god.

2112
02:33:41,790 --> 02:33:42,790
There's no one more.

2113
02:33:42,810 --> 02:33:44,090
You're not one more portal!

2114
02:33:44,730 --> 02:33:45,810
That's crucial time.

2115
02:33:45,990 --> 02:33:46,710
And you have your cue back.

2116
02:33:46,830 --> 02:33:47,810
You should have your cue back very soon.

2117
02:33:48,770 --> 02:35:04,080
way to get them you might have to heal oh i don't think you're getting any heels out oh no you're you're dead no no no no oh we got four we got four four four for skin oh my god no no if you if you would have kept your port and watch my exercise you win that 100 yeah yeah yeah yeah dude i literally all I had on my screen I couldn't see the distance of my port because all I had was drone scan by the crypto drone yeah I literally could not see the distance I had left caution and Clara and Jack are not even the winners they didn't even win who died oh yeah apparently I asked tempo he's like oh yeah we can see the damage numbers so like anyone that has done any damage on the Tyler's team will get like points like taken away if I destroy a drone with my knife does that count as damage surely not right did you destroy a drone with a knife yeah I did oh no we were gonna oh it was like no no it wasn't any damage done to anybody oh it doesn't count as damage okay I was gonna say Tim was like I

2118
02:35:04,080 --> 02:35:08,740
was like oh my god did I self-report ourselves no we're good no we're

2119
02:35:13,730 --> 02:35:44,820
that'd be crazy i just self-reported hard that's so funny oh apparently we're people oh there's people punching and using oh people are heavy punching i see right so how do you see like the how do you see the overall like results yeah it's uh tempo posted in the general chat or the Nokia chat.

2120
02:35:47,920 --> 02:35:49,740
But that was like games one to three.

2121
02:35:50,440 --> 02:35:51,400
No, but they have.

2122
02:35:51,660 --> 02:35:53,080
We're currently seventh overall.

2123
02:35:53,980 --> 02:35:55,160
Oh, I don't need to see it.

2124
02:35:55,300 --> 02:35:55,740
I'm tripping.

2125
02:35:55,940 --> 02:35:57,560
It's games four to six.

2126
02:36:01,490 --> 02:36:02,670
Timbo literally typed in the game chat.

2127
02:36:02,810 --> 02:36:05,330
You know we can see individual player damage numbers, right?

2128
02:36:07,970 --> 02:36:08,910
You're caught, kid.

2129
02:36:09,330 --> 02:36:10,090
And I literally got that.

2130
02:36:10,450 --> 02:36:11,630
I got damage done.

2131
02:36:11,870 --> 02:36:13,690
I got hit for like 15 or whatever it is.

2132
02:36:13,810 --> 02:36:14,350
And you can melee someone.

2133
02:36:15,070 --> 02:37:27,950
that's so funny all right last game is last game lg i can't believe we're setting seven overall right now who's first uh 100 thieves oh oh my super ready i don't know wait is did they put two yeah yeah they added two games together yeah because 100 thieves got second i think i think we go with that comp the horizon oh yeah oh valc yeah i mean i'll just i could rip whoever it doesn't matter uh don't you pick first go oh my god i don't know i don't okay uh horizon horizon i don't know how i'll play valk i've never touched valk in my life okay i mean defaulty controller moment but uh it might be tetanop on the velk sir yeah of course you wait do you want velk no not oh yeah no that's not at all oh that's fine bro yeah i'll be i'll be fine on velk yeah i'll be good bro but you were you were cooking on rave though true he was yeah no we should no you should say rave you're cooking out rave i'm gonna throw on velk i'm not gonna okay i'll throw on velk i'll throw on valve because you were

2135
02:37:38,250 --> 02:37:39,030
Yeah, horizon, horizon.

2136
02:37:39,290 --> 02:37:40,010
I'll be the weakest thing.

2137
02:37:41,770 --> 02:37:42,710
Wait, so you want to go?

2138
02:37:42,850 --> 02:37:43,770
So you want to go Valk?

02:37:44,150 --> 02:37:44,930
Yeah, yeah, I go Valk.

2140
02:37:44,930 --> 02:37:46,370
Go right, go right, go right, go right.

2141
02:37:48,270 --> 02:37:48,810
Yeah, my bad.

2142
02:37:49,030 --> 02:37:51,470
I was looking at the overall scores.

2143
02:37:53,070 --> 02:37:53,610
I think so.

2144
02:37:53,750 --> 02:37:56,130
How does it say that we're overall in seventh though?

2145
02:37:56,290 --> 02:37:57,110
Because I'm looking at it.

2146
02:37:57,290 --> 02:37:58,990
We have a score of 213.

2147
02:37:59,550 --> 02:38:01,130
And we're in first on my screen.

2148
02:38:01,850 --> 02:38:02,270
Wait, what?

2149
02:38:03,050 --> 02:38:03,770
No, you're tripping.

2150
02:38:04,290 --> 02:38:04,770
No, you're tripping.

2151
02:38:04,910 --> 02:38:05,390
No, you're tripping.

2152
02:38:05,510 --> 02:38:39,410

2153
02:38:39,570 --> 02:38:51,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Obviously that's how it usually goes Coming in hot I'm surprised they haven't oh my gosh.

2154
02:38:52,030 --> 02:38:55,470
I can't believe they didn't play Gibby as well if they went Cossack and Gibby.

2155
02:38:55,870 --> 02:38:59,930
Oh, man That team would have been cooking and with kills

02:39:03,250 --> 02:39:32,290
You're trying to be every single med I've ever seen in the history of all time surely no one's gonna punch me this game surely i think i think tempo has uh has told them not to because he's like i can see all the damage that you guys do yeah they're griefing all right wait is this gonna be like a base driver zone maybe or bonsai base driver or bonsai where is that oh

2162
02:42:07,370 --> 02:42:08,970
Well, they probably have that timer, though, right?

2163
02:42:09,270 --> 02:42:10,250
I want to...

2164
02:42:10,250 --> 02:42:10,570
Yeah.

2165
02:42:12,310 --> 02:42:16,350
Okay, there might be a possibility that I get shot while doing this next one.

2166
02:42:17,010 --> 02:42:17,090
Wait.

2167
02:42:17,670 --> 02:42:18,510
Why does he have a gun?

2168
02:42:18,870 --> 02:42:19,530
That guy has a...

2169
02:42:19,530 --> 02:42:19,750
Oh, wait.

2170
02:42:19,850 --> 02:42:20,530
No, it's his heirloom.

2171
02:42:20,890 --> 02:42:21,630
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

2172
02:42:22,550 --> 02:42:23,710
It looks like he had a gun, you know.

2173
02:42:23,910 --> 02:42:24,970
You're a tripping, fool.

2174
02:42:25,610 --> 02:42:26,190
Hey, man.

2175
02:42:26,710 --> 02:42:27,290
Hey, man.

2176
02:42:27,450 --> 02:42:28,390
I don't want to die, man.

2177
02:42:33,190 --> 02:42:35,250
Alright, going for the next scan.

2178
02:42:37,210 --> 02:42:38,170
Guys, we're...

2179
02:42:38,170 --> 02:42:41,450
Why are you guys contributing to the armor upgrades, guys?

2180
02:42:42,170 --> 02:42:43,110
I don't see anything.

2181
02:42:43,410 --> 02:42:45,410
I can't do anything, honestly.

2182
02:42:45,990 --> 02:42:48,010
Honestly, this is like group effort.

2183
02:42:48,150 --> 02:42:50,390
Why am I doing all the scans for us?

2184
02:42:50,410 --> 02:42:51,450
I did hit the juicer.

2185
02:42:51,750 --> 02:42:52,670
I did hit the person.

2186
02:42:53,910 --> 02:42:54,770
Check your map.

2187
02:42:55,390 --> 02:42:55,630
Wait.

2188
02:42:55,950 --> 02:42:58,330
Isn't there like a...

2189
02:42:58,330 --> 02:42:58,830
No.

2190
02:42:59,170 --> 02:43:00,390
Bro, there's so many people.

2191
02:43:00,550 --> 02:43:01,430
Alright, there is...

2192
02:43:01,430 --> 02:43:03,090
I have another one at Bonzai.

2193
02:43:03,210 --> 02:43:05,770
Oh my gosh, nobody He trusts anyone anywhere.

2194
02:43:05,890 --> 02:43:07,870
This is my...

2195
02:43:07,870 --> 02:43:08,770
This is my spot.

2196
02:43:10,150 --> 02:43:11,510
That's not conspicuous at all.

2197
02:43:12,250 --> 02:43:13,810
I'm heading for the another beacon.

2198
02:43:15,070 --> 02:43:15,930
This is my nether.

2199
02:43:16,730 --> 02:43:18,070
He is painting in assholes.

2200
02:43:19,890 --> 02:43:21,670
How do we get purple armor, guys?

2201
02:43:22,190 --> 02:43:23,930
I don't think...

2202
02:43:23,930 --> 02:43:27,250
Yeah, we have to go, like, out here to get this, and I'm scared of this direction.

2203
02:43:28,350 --> 02:43:28,630
Oh, maybe.

2204
02:43:29,290 --> 02:43:30,270
That'll be fine.

2205
02:43:30,710 --> 02:43:31,710
He'll be healthy.

2206
02:43:34,610 --> 02:43:35,310
You know what?

2207
02:43:35,630 --> 02:43:36,830
I'll do it for the team.

2208
02:43:37,590 --> 02:43:39,110
I'm grabbing it for us.

2209
02:43:39,170 --> 02:43:40,230
There's a real MVP this whole time.

2210
02:43:40,370 --> 02:43:41,010
I'm gonna cave up.

2211
02:43:43,590 --> 02:43:44,310
Alright guys.

2212
02:43:44,950 --> 02:43:46,370
I'm gonna go head to that.

2213
02:43:47,070 --> 02:43:47,510
Where is it?

2214
02:43:47,530 --> 02:43:48,470
Wait, where's the evil harvester?

2215
02:43:48,990 --> 02:43:49,950
Where even is it?

2216
02:43:49,950 --> 02:43:50,910
Where even is it?

2217
02:43:52,150 --> 02:43:54,390
I feel like I'm definitely not doing a good job hiding here.

2218
02:43:54,930 --> 02:43:56,190
I feel like you can definitely see me.

2219
02:43:57,950 --> 02:43:58,330
Wait, where?

2220
02:43:59,330 --> 02:44:00,690
I don't see any evil harvester.

2221
02:44:01,110 --> 02:44:01,630
Oh, it's here.

2222
02:44:01,990 --> 02:44:03,850

All right, I don't need to be here.

2229
02:44:44,330 --> 02:44:45,650
You can probably tell that I'm hiding in.

2230
02:44:47,470 --> 02:44:48,310
I'm gonna pick this tree.

2231
02:44:49,510 --> 02:44:50,490
Wait, this is in the zone.

Wait, do you- do you remember the climb up?

02:46:39,970 --> 02:46:40,590
Wait, I almost did it.

2266
02:46:40,670 --> 02:46:40,790
Hold on.

2267
02:46:40,910 --> 02:46:41,130

Guys, what happened to your stride?

2271
02:46:50,810 --> 02:46:52,630
You're not allowed to use the car.

2272
02:46:54,010 --> 02:46:55,010
They're not allowed to use strides.

2273
02:46:55,190 --> 02:46:56,790
It's the bloodhound that was shooting last game!

2274
02:46:57,510 --> 02:46:58,890
Bro, who is this bloodhound?

2275
02:46:59,050 --> 02:46:59,650
He's wild.

2276
02:46:59,890 --> 02:47:02,110

02:47:31,230 --> 02:47:31,710
I did it before.

2290
02:47:31,910 --> 02:47:32,410

02:48:09,990 --> 02:48:10,570
I'm gonna try that.

2296
02:48:10,870 --> 02:48:13,770
I think I'm good, but like, to the right, there's such a big opening.

2297
02:48:14,010 --> 02:48:14,770
Like, I might be- Try it.

2298
02:48:14,810 --> 02:48:15,910
You can try getting closer to me.

2299
02:48:16,190 --> 02:48:17,170
We did get a zone.

2300
02:48:17,330 --> 02:48:18,590
I don't think I can get closer to you, bro.

2301
02:48:18,790 --> 02:48:20,010
Wait, I'm gonna try doing it too.

2302
02:48:20,250 --> 02:48:22,250
I'm gonna climb to you as well.

2303
02:48:24,750 --> 02:48:26,690
You think if I do it, I'll fall off the ledge?

2304
02:48:26,930 --> 02:48:28,150
We're all- all of us are doing it now.

2305
02:48:28,210 --> 02:48:28,930
This is so funny.

2306
02:48:31,190 --> 02:48:31,810
Wings up.

2307
02:48:33,170 --> 02:48:34,530
How did you guys do that?

2308
02:48:34,690 --> 02:48:34,810
What?

2309
02:48:35,650 --> 02:48:36,510
It's low-key hard.

2310
02:48:36,650 --> 02:48:38,390
Like, you know, there's a whole W key to it.

2311
02:48:38,830 --> 02:48:40,670
Oh my god, they're all here now.

2312
02:48:41,270 --> 02:48:42,350
Guys, I can't do it.

2313
02:48:42,850 --> 02:48:45,210
Oh, no, everyone wants to do it.

2314
02:48:45,210 --> 02:48:45,810
Setting us up.

2315
02:48:47,190 --> 02:48:48,090
They're all sick.

2316
02:48:48,130 --> 02:48:51,050
Yeah, we're getting muddled down for sure.

2317
02:48:51,430 --> 02:48:52,410
I can't do it on the others.

2318
02:48:52,530 --> 02:48:55,770
I can do it on the safe side.

2319
02:49:02,550 --> 02:49:04,470
Bro, I don't know how you guys are doing it.

2320
02:49:04,710 --> 02:49:05,590
Yeah, they don't want to cheat.

2321
02:49:06,150 --> 02:49:06,790
Get called out.

2322
02:49:09,690 --> 02:49:10,170
Are they trying?

2323
02:49:15,460 --> 02:49:18,260
I hear some of the things around me, but like, I don't know what's happening.

2324
02:49:18,440 --> 02:49:19,360
It's just us.

2325
02:49:19,640 --> 02:49:25,820
I want to let you know, brother, like, one horizon tag to, like, get up here and, like, it's over for me.

2326
02:49:26,060 --> 02:49:26,500
Oh, my God.

2327
02:49:26,600 --> 02:49:27,180

She's right.

2331
02:49:32,360 --> 02:49:32,940
I'm not moving.

2332
02:49:33,400 --> 02:49:34,540
How would she know, Moose?

2333
02:49:35,060 --> 02:49:36,040
How would she know?

2334
02:49:37,720 --> 02:49:39,980
She's going to think she cleared this whole area, move on, and we're good.

2335
02:49:40,480 --> 02:49:41,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2336
02:49:41,540 --> 02:49:41,840

2339
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:21,680
I'm saying, bro.

2340
02:51:21,940 --> 02:51:22,560
Yeah, exactly.

2341
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:27,040
Or throw the whole game to Kraft Doki, like real ones.

2342
02:51:30,040 --> 02:51:31,260
One's right underneath us.

2343
02:51:31,400 --> 02:51:33,100
Yeah, 20 seconds, dude.

2344
02:51:33,180 --> 02:51:33,640
We gotta go.

2345
02:51:35,080 --> 02:51:36,100
Oh, they're like...

2346
02:51:36,100 --> 02:51:37,960
Climb this, climb this, climb this, climb this now, climb this now.

2347
02:51:38,720 --> 02:51:41,060
All I'm saying is you guys should have done the plan earlier.

2348
02:51:41,920 --> 02:51:42,500
You hesitated.

2349
02:51:43,840 --> 02:51:49,740
I believe 10 seconds to the ring it's close they can't come up here you hesitate I will scream drop at the top of my lungs Oh, I'm in danger.

2350
02:51:49,800 --> 02:51:52,820
Just letting you know Wait, but do you have portals for the last?

2351
02:51:53,300 --> 02:51:54,880
Do you have portal for the last one?

2352
02:51:56,240 --> 02:51:56,540
You're fine.

2353
02:51:56,540 --> 02:51:56,580
You're fine.

2354
02:51:56,580 --> 02:51:56,900
I'll have it.

2355
02:51:57,020 --> 02:52:02,520
I'll have it back soon Okay, because I was gonna say Maybe you should grab some alt I'm not in zone.

2356
02:52:06,200 --> 02:52:12,560
I'm not in freaking zone.

2357
02:52:12,960 --> 02:52:13,120
Come to me.

2358
02:52:13,240 --> 02:52:13,400
Come to me.

2359
02:52:13,500 --> 02:52:13,500
Come to me.

2360
02:52:13,580 --> 02:52:16,700
Come to me Oh, trust me, I'm coming.

2361
02:52:19,820 --> 02:52:21,440
Oh, they're so close.

2362
02:52:21,880 --> 02:52:22,320
They're so close.

2363
02:52:22,580 --> 02:52:22,820
They're so close.

2364
02:52:22,960 --> 02:52:23,220
I know there.

2365
02:52:23,360 --> 02:52:23,600
I know there.

2366
02:52:23,760 --> 02:52:24,040
I know there.

2367
02:52:26,320 --> 02:52:26,900
It's a wraith.

2368
02:52:27,520 --> 02:52:27,900
That's a wraith.

2369
02:52:28,040 --> 02:52:28,580
That's not them.

2370
02:52:29,940 --> 02:52:30,760
I just do a bait queue.

2371
02:52:33,560 --> 02:52:33,900
All right.

2372
02:52:33,980 --> 02:52:36,100
When you see a stack of people, remember to throw a queue on them.

2373
02:52:37,960 --> 02:52:38,520
I can't.

2374
02:52:38,640 --> 02:52:40,020
I need to get DCB for that little key.

2375
02:52:40,480 --> 02:52:42,240
No, they can't because it's not damage.

2376
02:52:42,440 --> 02:52:43,640
It's not damage.

2377
02:52:45,620 --> 02:52:46,340
It works.

2378
02:52:46,560 --> 02:52:47,660
You got to fend for yourself.

2379
02:52:48,640 --> 02:52:49,380
This is so dumb.

2380
02:52:49,560 --> 02:52:50,860
This is the worst hiding spot of all time.

2381
02:52:51,140 --> 02:52:52,580
You know what to do with you, too.

2382
02:52:52,580 --> 02:52:53,540
This zone is so bad, too.

2383
02:52:54,200 --> 02:52:55,620
Also, you might need a heal.

2384
02:52:58,100 --> 02:52:58,600
Oh, they're right there?

2385
02:52:59,560 --> 02:53:00,280
I'm right there.

2386
02:53:00,340 --> 02:53:01,020
I'm right here.

2387
02:53:01,160 --> 02:53:01,760
I'm here.

2388
02:53:04,680 --> 02:53:06,740
Oh, there's the guy to your right as well.

2389
02:53:08,740 --> 02:53:09,940

2404
02:53:28,720 --> 02:53:29,540
I have a replay.

2405
02:53:29,740 --> 02:53:29,920
Can I go?

2406
02:53:30,140 --> 02:53:30,400
I have a replay.

2407
02:53:31,620 --> 02:53:32,720
Ducky, can you sit out on the wall?

2408
02:53:32,800 --> 02:53:33,360
Can you sit on this wall?

2409
02:53:33,620 --> 02:53:33,940
I'm trying.

2410
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:34,760
I'm trying so hard.

2411
02:53:36,200 --> 02:53:37,940
No, I can't, I can't, I can't, I couldn't!

2412
02:53:40,520 --> 02:53:41,680
Ducky's in the other side of us now.

2413
02:53:42,280 --> 02:53:43,120
They're so close to me, bro.

2414
02:53:43,840 --> 02:53:44,860
They're so close to me, bro.

2415
02:53:45,500 --> 02:53:46,960
They're so close to me, bro.

2416
02:53:48,600 --> 02:53:49,680
Can I take that port moves or no?

2417
02:53:52,540 --> 02:53:53,940
You can, but it's not in zone.

2418
02:53:54,740 --> 02:53:57,060
It's fine, but you still live for now.

2419
02:53:58,540 --> 02:53:59,800
And there might be one above us.

2420
02:54:02,040 --> 02:54:03,220
As long as Doki's up, we're good.

2421
02:54:03,600 --> 02:54:06,100

02:56:27,120 --> 02:56:28,660
Yeah, I messed up.

02:56:29,280 --> 02:56:31,000
I died to the right.

2449
02:56:35,140 --> 02:56:37,520
I was like, don't worry.

2450
02:56:37,680 --> 02:56:37,740
I was like, don't worry.

2451
02:56:37,940 --> 02:56:38,340
I can literally do this.

2452
02:56:38,600 --> 02:56:39,120
What did we do?

2453
02:56:40,320 --> 02:56:41,460
I've never run out of ammo.

2454
02:56:44,540 --> 02:56:47,700
I didn't realize the zone goes so fast.

2455
02:56:48,760 --> 02:57:40,240
I was trying to stall like my oh dang it guys oh so sad I had such a good plan too but then it was like I was like oh maybe not now because I don't want to have to hold my my port for that long you had the plan and then if you got the one HP wait what was the plan he just stood over top of me yeah he just sat there I was trying to hug the wall what even was the plan you guys were crafting so basically what we did last game where i start my portal at the very top yeah of uh of a horizon queue and then i finish it at the bottom so basically you just keep dropping from one portal to another infinitely oh so like how did it fail well i got shot as soon as i as soon as i read the

2456
02:57:43,400 --> 02:57:50,680
wanted to do yeah that that seems right that seems right just getting shot right after

2457
02:57:54,460 --> 02:58:03,560
it's okay we both met we all of us messed up i was in my alt form and i might have let the zone kill me while i was alting because i mistimed the zone

2458
02:58:11,110 --> 02:58:15,790
that's what oh my wait everyone's doing it oh my god you theory crafted that not everyone's doing

2464
03:00:24,540 --> 03:00:26,580
I think I enjoyed the most playing Siki.

2465
03:00:29,460 --> 03:00:35,320
Don't, they're like, don't, they're like, don't forget to join the mainstream, but which is the mainstream?

2466
03:00:36,960 --> 03:00:41,540
I have a feeling it's probably, it's probably Jino?

2467
03:00:42,260 --> 03:00:43,420
Yeah, I'm at Jino's stream.

2468
03:00:43,580 --> 03:00:44,560
I'm at Jino's stream right now.

2469
03:00:44,620 --> 03:00:45,400
Is that the mainstream?

2470
03:00:46,100 --> 03:00:52,520
Or you can go either go Slapshot underscore GD or you can go to Rain Day or you can go to Vicky Kitty.

2471
03:00:52,720 --> 03:00:53,320
Oh, so there's.

2472
03:00:53,380 --> 03:01:14,620

You're so lucky.

You're the first.

2478
03:01:33,950 --> 03:01:34,350
I missed it, bro.

2479
03:01:34,470 --> 03:01:34,870
For the seekers.

2480
03:01:35,110 --> 03:01:35,530
Yeah, yeah.

2481
03:01:35,630 --> 03:01:38,330
You're so lucky I didn't go Cossack for three games in a row.

2482
03:01:38,330 --> 03:01:41,150
Yeah, I am lucky I didn't go Cossack in game one.

2483
03:01:41,290 --> 03:01:42,570
I can't believe I just won the...

2484
03:01:42,570 --> 03:01:42,930
Wait, what?

2485
03:01:43,050 --> 03:01:44,010
Yeah, you won first.

2486
03:01:44,190 --> 03:01:44,410
Yeah.

2487
03:01:45,650 --> 03:01:46,530
That's crazy.

2488
03:01:46,770 --> 03:01:49,550
It's all because Doki gave it to me pretty much.

2489
03:01:49,750 --> 03:01:50,950
That's basically what it is.

2490
03:01:50,990 --> 03:01:52,510
I should just be thanking Doki.

2491
03:01:52,670 --> 03:01:53,910
Yeah, I could have...

2492
03:01:53,910 --> 03:01:57,770
If I really wanted to, I could have went Cossack three games in a row.

2493
03:02:00,630 --> 03:02:02,730
look i'm just i'm so humble

2494
03:02:09,690 --> 03:02:15,550
i'm still trying to find the stream guys i'm still trying to find the stream

2495
03:02:23,160 --> 03:02:24,600
oh i found it i found it

2496
03:02:28,360 --> 03:02:47,880
wait i'll let you guys place so arm down on that you guys hear this multiple times so there's a bunch of adjustments we have to make for each game Since by default, it's set to give 25 points to whoever ended this session because we assumed first would always be the seekers there.

2497
03:02:47,920 --> 03:02:48,580
All right, how about now?

2498
03:02:48,660 --> 03:02:49,120
Is that better?

2499
03:02:49,400 --> 03:02:51,720
100 thieves had such a massive lead.

2500
03:02:51,900 --> 03:02:52,560
Is that better?

2501
03:02:53,160 --> 03:02:54,360
From the first three games.

2502
03:02:54,760 --> 03:02:55,160
Bro, goat rats.

2503
03:02:55,420 --> 03:03:01,420
They just needed to maintain a decent placement across the last three games, which is what they did.

2504
03:03:02,080 --> 03:03:04,020
And then they kept their first place spot.

2505
03:03:05,020 --> 03:03:09,420
So with that, I have three little messages to say before we...

2506
03:03:09,440 --> 03:03:11,420
we part ways tonight.

2507
03:03:11,620 --> 03:03:25,260
The first one is, obviously, you know, I, if you go to, if you went to where I suggest you go to thenokia.com now slash Apex over Wi-Fi that all the casters were using, all the players, the draw will be done on Monday.

2508
03:03:25,620 --> 03:03:30,340
So for the controllers, that will be done on Monday, and it will be posted and we'll announce it accordingly.

2509
03:03:30,940 --> 03:03:32,280
So super excited about that.

2510
03:03:33,020 --> 03:03:38,960
The second announcement is we actually have for all of the people that participate, all the 60 players, That's me.

2513
03:03:42,340 --> 03:03:46,500

2522
03:03:55,400 --> 03:03:56,260
