00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:59,450
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:00,490
Hello!

3
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:11,050
Look, okay, we know we're like 17 minutes late, but it's Andy's fault, not mine obviously.

4
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,070
How is it mine?

5
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:16,470
I have been here for not even three seconds.

6
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,410
And you're already shifting blame.

7
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:22,680
No, we were like, I told you to be farting on!

8
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,440
I have been- I have been- You did it!

9
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,880
No, no, no, it was your- thing.

10
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,120
I waited for him.

11
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,720
Doki, D-O-K-I.

12
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,800
You were the one that said, have you seen the new Fugi?

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,700
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't spot it.

14
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,300
Don't spot it.

15
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,760
We had a perfectly good reason why we were late.

16
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,580
We had a really good reason.

17
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,960
We had to set something up very special.

18
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,120
And it was obviously our brilliant ideas together.

19
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,440
Like, we came up with this idea together.

20
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,500
It was a group effort.

21
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:28,860
um we worked very hard but like we can't show it yet because like we realize uh we realized i guess that it might have been inappropriate in the beginning so you'll see later why it took us so long to get started um also because i had to get coffee because i would have been awake since uh four in the morning um because guys for those who were here in the morning i was streaming uh marvel rivals as always Yeah.

22
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,700
As one does.

23
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,420
As one does at four in the morning.

24
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,100
So I was supposed to take a nap.

25
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:45,920
Even Zandu took a nap, but I didn't take a nap at all because like, I'm not a responsible person.

26
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,280
I was just a little bit and just like, oh man, this is going to be, I don't know why.

27
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,480
I'm so I'm so rusty.

28
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,440
Is this going to be okay?

29
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,740
I'm going to take a nap and just call my nerves.

30
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:59,380
and now i'm here and i have red bull in my system and i'm ready to go yeah i have coffee in my system so we're so ready for uh for fortnite um anyway it was my idea because i was like i don't care what we're doing i'm playing fortnite obviously it's like no matter what solo duo collab i'm still gonna play fortnite like if you want you threw like a bunch of suggestions my way and i did consider all of them like oh these can be fun oh this could be really fun and then you just said oh yeah there's a simpson fortnite thing and i just thought you know what yeah you know why not simpson yeah it's so cool he made the entire map into like springfield and everything i saw like the easter eggs around like there's even like you can do the couch gag too like the oh you can i think you can kill flanders which is like oh my god they have super they have stupid sexy flanders as an emo i don't know if you saw that yeah this feels like i'm feeling wearing nothing at all nothing at all yeah yeah and he

31
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:50,820
shakes his ass and you can the thing is it's an emote so you can put it on anyone oh no yeah do you still do you wait which is the most cursed skin that you've seen no i'm good i have alien i have um i have mr beast so like like the mr beast like jimmy no you don't understand i spent a lot of money on for night just for skins i literally log in buy skins log out wait but i thought a battle pass you have to play to unlock everything why don't you care about battle passes i'm here for the pay to win like i had the pay to skin bro you want me to grind battle passes bro that's too much work i mean i i've never grinded a battle pass i mean i've only paid like twice for for cosmetics Wait,

32
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,360
I think I pre-pressured you to do that one time.

33
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:54,820
I remember.

34
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,260
Okay, never mind.

35
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,060
Three times.

36
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:56,660
Three times.

37
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,740
Yeah, I remember.

38
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:01,740
I remember I told you the first you to buy the Battle Pass one time.

39
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:02,340
I remember.

40
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:12,600
At least I was sober and I didn't get drunk and buy it and think, oh, well, now I got it, that was my descent.

41
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,960
After that, I bought every skin I bought from then on was sober.

42
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,520
It was my Fortnite.

43
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:51,160
is what my it was just your awakening yeah this was not an this was not a mistake this was the inception it was meant to be it was my gateway drug but Jesus Christ from there it was all downhill from there also sound guy brought Xander up a little bit is it good now I also have a sound guy Xander you want me you want to pause you want to join a team um you need if you need a sound team That's true.

44
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:51,640
That's true.

45
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,360
All right.

46
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,300
Anyway, sorry.

47
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,560
That was our introduction.

48
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,820
That was Well, welcome Sandu to the stream.

49
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,260
We're now going to be serious.

50
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,320
We're like, I don't know, like we were talking, like, how the fuck do we get to the serious part of the stream?

51
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,180
So without making it awkward.

52
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:09,480
Yeah.

53
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,600
I think it'll just like, it's important.

54
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,980
So we'll just like, get it set and then focus on having fun.

55
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:16,320
Yeah.

56
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:16,540
Yeah.

57
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:45,660
So we're going to make this, a statement here um but it was just the only time we're gonna talk about this and then like after that we're just fucking fortnighting i i mean technically we we've been um we've been vibing already like you tell like it's not like this is our first time talking together that'd be fucking weird um we've been shooting the crap a little bit yeah yeah i i told zandu about my uh about the VR story.

58
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,000
He laughed at me.

59
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,100
He was like, that's fucking funny.

60
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,000
Like, and I was like, bro, I was crying.

61
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,640
Like, OK, OK, chat, you got to understand the way she framed this.

62
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,600
Like, she framed it.

63
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,100
Like, Doki is a great storyteller.

64
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:05,680
Don't let her tell you anything different because like the way she was framing anything and then just she doesn't say anything.

65
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,100
She just posts a picture of the corner of her room.

66
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,680
And if a picture could tell a thousand words, I tell you, mate.

67
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:19,000
But those who did not see the photo, don't worry, I'll give you guys the visual.

68
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:25,600
So, um, so this is what, oh yeah, oh yeah, and then like, he was like, this looks like lost.

69
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,320
And I was like, I know.

70
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:35,340
I did think that, but I didn't want to be like, if it's in purpose, I'm walking into the biggest gotcha.

71
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,100
So yeah, this, yeah.

72
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:41,040
So for those who don't know, I've been trying, I was trying to set up my VR.

73
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:41,560
There it is.

74
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,260
There it is.

75
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,080
Is this lost?

76
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,240
Yeah, is this lost?

77
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,860
All of that is tape.

78
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,840
That is, it's gorilla tape too.

79
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,080
Um, and I was trying to put my audio foam on there as a platform for my VR stuff.

80
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,100
And then, um, the ruins.

81
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,300
And, um, sadly it did not work because it's under the fucking vent.

82
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,960
And I, that was the day I learned that, um, hot air melts adhesive.

83
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:10,940
Did you know that?

84
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:11,860
That's so crazy.

85
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,360
I did not know that.

86
00:08:13,700 --> 00:09:26,780
no why i didn't realize the thermodynamics what things can melt like not just ice cream what do you what do you think it's called a hot glue gun i don't think i don't know when it's hot it's still sticky so like why is it not sticky anywhere and then i also showed him this so where like i stuck a fucking box in the corner of the room and it worked like that was my solution um hey if it works if it works i did not see the box wait you see this oh yeah here sorry here's the yeah that was the solution i stuck a box on the wall and i have not seen the box that's a new one yeah yeah that's the one i didn't show him but yeah so the phone didn't work but the box did and i put like the vr base station up top of that so that's how i got my vr stuff to work and that's how i was able to do my sponsor all right serious time okay fool it's gonna be awkward no matter what because like we had like yeah i don't think there's any way to like ski it around this so like um so this is like the only time

87
00:09:26,780 --> 00:10:01,400
we're gonna address this and then after that we're not gonna talk about it anymore so we're gonna make one statement and then that's it um but uh this is so hard because i'm going first so like after that it's like no pressure no pressure i'm going first um but then zani's gonna make his own little little statement too so um so obviously a lot of people are very surprised that you know we're here together um and we're talking and we're doing a stream together um but this has been like

88
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:32,300
wrote this like wrote what I want to say to like I was like I wrote bullet points too don't worry yeah we both wrote but even then I'm like well this is difficult reading what I wrote like yeah I feel like I'm back in school about to do an English presentation yeah yeah me too I feel I'm doing like public speaking right now and like like chat is like our professor and like we just need guys we just need 80% to pass guys that's all we need professor tomato please I just need

89
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:45,700
Anyway, so a year ago, Zandu sent me a really thoughtful message to apologize.

90
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:53,500
But at that point, I was like really afraid to respond because, you know, I wasn't ready at that time.

91
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:58,480
But it was only a few days ago that I was finally ready.

92
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:04,420
And I tried to reach back to him and want to know if like he was okay and everything.

93
00:11:06,700 --> 00:12:06,920
of God and Nicole together and we had a lot of talk together and also I also want you guys to all know that Xandu did privately apologize to me and I have accepted his apology and because we're all human and we're allowed to make mistakes and since that's what being adult is and we all make mistakes and we learn from it and we're not perfect you know we're human and I was able to forgive him and move on and I'm happy to have my friend back too uh he also wanted to give a few words to everyone before we start and like i said it will be the last thing we say about all of the subject uh because we just want to have fun and around in fortnite and you know go to the springfield exactly thank you so much jokey for that and for that it's your turn yeah it's my turn let me see if i got my bullet points here and if i mess anything up i'm sorry but see if i remember how to do this i haven't spoken english in a while so you'll have to forgive me but um Yeah,

94
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:18,900
as a lot of people know, there's been a lot of happenings, both online and personally for me, and I've been taking some time away because I felt that that was necessary for me to recover, reflect, and protect my well-being, all that jazz.

95
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:24,520
And that distance also helped me process everything that sort of happened and gained some clarity about it all.

96
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:33,000
And I'm not going to lie, it was very painful and overwhelming at times, but I think stepping back was honestly the healthiest thing that I've been able to do.

97
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,640
And I feel a lot better now.

98
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,580
I've been able to connect with a bunch of people.

99
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,160
I've been talking a lot with my dad lately, so that's a lot of fun.

100
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,840
But I also should bring up that I'm not like coming back to streaming or anything.

101
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,160
I'm still taking things rather slowly and focusing on myself.

102
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:56,140
I don't really know what I'll do in the future, but I hope that we can just play games and have fun today and appreciate it for what it is.

103
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:04,620
And yeah, basically along in that whole time, I also realized that me and Doki were probably sharing a lot of synchronicity.

104
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,940
similar experiences that I wish I was capable of seeing at the time.

105
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:13,120
I was misinformed and felt pressured into decisions that I would later go on to truly regret.

106
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,820
And later that I would find out things that I believe weren't entirely accurate.

107
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:21,300
And I wished I understood things better before reacting the way I did.

108
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:24,120
And that understanding is what led me to reach out in the end.

109
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:32,460
And I'm grateful that Doki was so gracious and would even give me the time a day and allow us to reconnect and everything.

110
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:40,340
So like, genuinely, I know I said this privately already, but like, I'm so sorry, man, and all of that distance that it created.

111
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:47,180
And we had to go through a bunch of stuff, like apart, instead of being able to be there for each other and support each other, because I do care.

112
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:47,960
I care back then.

113
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,380
I still care now, and I always will.

114
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:57,380
And I'm, I'm just happy that we're you gave me the time of day and we're willing to like, hear me out, talk to me, and make amends.

115
00:13:57,460 --> 00:15:07,360
And we can play games and be silly and talk about Kurt's stuff again because I will tell you even during our like big sappy like reunion call and everything she still springs some of the most out of left field things on me talking about like the PP museum which I didn't even know existed until she brought it up oh yeah and then he I was like bro I heard they have like I think they have like Hitler's ball in that in that museum and then and then Zandu was like no that's wrapped Rasputin's peepee and I was like how do you know that I thought that was like the one thing that everybody knew that like there was like was one specific dude that they like for whatever reason pickled it but how would you know he was like that's common knowledge and I was like how is that common knowledge why do you know Rasputin's dick was pickled I thought I thought that's why he was Russia's greatest love machine but that doesn't imply that they pickled his dick no like that comes later it was a story it was

116
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:30,020
a shame how he carried on but yeah i'm just referencing song lyrics guys i'm just referencing song lyrics please that is not common knowledge then dude i knew it was i was like we're gonna ask chat i was like We're gonna have to ask Chad if that's common knowledge or not Okay,

117
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:39,600
I saw a few people a lot of people just like well, yeah They did like like he is right bro They'll just say you're right just because they're like we gotta give him that one.

118
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:58,380
Yo You just like he may have unbased opinions on sandwich toppings But by God he is right about the pickle the pee-pee But yeah like during like the you know our very heartfelt conversations Like, did you hear about the PP Museum?

119
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:05,440
Like, I don't remember how, like, my, I brought that up, but, like, it was, like, in the middle of a heartfelt conversation.

120
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:15,780
It was so out of left field, because I can be talking about, like, yeah, I've been, like, making drawers with my dads, and I'm learning how to laminate things.

121
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,000
He taught me how to, like, grill a steak and everything.

122
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,060
That joke, it just goes, have you seen the mega Star You memes?

123
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,400
Oh, yeah, yeah.

124
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,300
I was like, no.

125
00:16:26,140 --> 00:17:33,120
gigantic star me yeah running at me like a freight train i felt genuine fear that's my hyper fixation right now that's i i was like because he's like living like the amish right now um so okay whoa that's your you're i am not you said that you said that no no no no no no that's not how it works i have electricity i have electricity and water thank you very much yeah the bare minimum so he's Amish at the moment like he's literally off the grid when because I was like bro what what have you been doing and I was like have you not seen the star meme memes like you know that's very important to me because like that's like you know that was the first thing yeah I was like bro you're missing out on the internet I was like I can't believe you didn't even know what the star meme memes like like it's the one thing you should know about um I think you sent me like three three different memes that you miss that are important you need to study these yeah i think mega star me was one of them yeah

126
00:17:33,120 --> 00:18:26,040
yeah you're missing out bro anyway oh yeah yeah yeah by the way um wait you're done with your your the series because like sorry we started interrupted during the oh no it's okay i that was basically everything and like the just everybody keep kindness in your heart be kind to one another and just focus on your own happiness and that's all that should to you yeah and star me and mega star me and mega star me of course yeah yeah yeah okay anyway so this is the reason why we're late okay okay sandy do it do the thing oh okay so she spent like 10 minutes like no we cannot get started yet i need to make you look like this and i'm like but what about like the thing we both have prepared oh yeah you might want to have to do this after because i don't want you speaking all serious looking like this

127
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:56,470
so this is apparently what a dokey has designated my outfit for today i am strong you shout out use shout out to the artist i was looking for like a chibi to use because i was like bro this is disgusting it's just a square like i got you gotta be like a little chibi man you gotta be just like a square on my screen and i was like you probably look for a chibi and then i i was like

128
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,320
It's really good stuff.

129
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,180
This is the fate that I have been designated.

130
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:05,900
So, yeah.

131
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,200
And then like the thing is I made, I like, you know, made it transparent and everything.

132
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,920
I was like, it might not be a good idea to have you, you know, make your whole.

133
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,040
We do our serious talk and you're just a fucking strawberry.

134
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,940
Yeah, I did think about that.

135
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,340
But you were struggling so much.

136
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,540
You could not get it to work.

137
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,760
And eventually you just get up, gave up and said, you know what Zandu?

138
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,640
You do it on your end.

139
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,040
Yeah, you're on your phone.

140
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:30,640
Yeah.

141
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:38,680
And then you send me the freaking picture and I, I see that she has removed the background and I just go, you had the time to render it.

142
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,640
And it turns out the reason we were late is because she was rendering this.

143
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,980
It was not the full 10 minutes.

144
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:51,680
I was also trying to be sure that we were not streaming on Twitch too.

145
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,820
Like I had to do that.

146
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,860
Because that's also important.

147
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:06,040
I was trying to find a TV because I was like, okay, we're going to have to be late because I don't want you to be a square on my screen because like because that's not aesthetic, bro.

148
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,240
That's not aesthetic.

149
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,060
Everything is a square these days.

150
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,800
Or if you want to get a little saucy with it, you round the corners.

151
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:21,580
Oh, oh, if I have a locker right now, I'd stuff you in it.

152
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,940
Lisa, that would be back in the locker.

153
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,020
Don't give you a swirly right now.

154
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,020
You fucking know.

155
00:20:29,940 --> 00:21:28,780
swirling again this is why i didn't put the fortnite screen up because i'm i'm my character is an alien with kicks on and i felt that was very inappropriate with my very serious conversation just aura farming during that so i'll put up my game now yeah so i was just like yeah i don't think i should have my my alien character with his kicks on the screen while we're having our little serious stock here um but i swear fortnite has like it's like such a big file now where you already added so much stuff to it is a thick chunky boy yes yeah i mean this game is like what 10 plus years old now it's like don't say that don't say that out loud but it's younger than league the fact that this is younger than league is crazy no it's not yes it is no it's not fortnite was after league okay league of legends no i i know yoki i genuinely think you're wrong Because I was there when League was new.

156
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,640
Yeah, 2009 was League.

157
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,060
Exactly.

158
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,380
Fortnite was like mid-2010s, right?

159
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:40,580
Right?

160
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,200
Why are you quiet?

161
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:46,500
You're so close, Zandu.

162
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,600
What?

163
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,500
Hold on.

164
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,720
Fortnite, I'm Googling this right now.

165
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,120
Fortnite release date.

166
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,800
You're literally talking.

167
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:47,020
talking out of your ass what do you mean this well I spent 10 years on the between them there is 10 years almost a decade I was talking about decade guys I was when I said 10 years I was specifying league so you said Fortnite was older I don't know I don't have rewind on just whoa can't check it DVR is off oh oh my God you actually oh my God the YouTube face is different i never noticed oh yeah it's different whoa they have an intro oh my god i missed out on the intro oh yeah the intro it's very loud oh my god oh my god it is oh my god there's an intro i missed out on it because i was gaslighting you

168
00:22:53,260 --> 00:23:30,640
whoa fun fact about the opening for the simpsons uh the theme song is composed by danny elfman oh yeah i know that fun fact yeah like i actually didn't know that until like last year or something wait that's that's great i'm surprised like has danny elfman ever done anything recently i feel like he's just been like riding off of his like uh bees from nightmare before christmas and simpsons i think he's done plenty more than that dokey like but i do will admit whenever tim burton's doing anything he's usually there yeah like uh the the The first Mission Impossible movie was composed by him,

169
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,000
I believe.

170
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,720
Yeah, but I meant recently.

171
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:37,400
Also, Sound Guide, let me know the game audio and Xandu is okay.

172
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,480
So you gotta check up the Fortnite audio that you use.

173
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,980
Everybody's saying Daft Punk.

174
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,740
Wait, he wasn't Daft Punk?

175
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:50,080
No, it's because my skin is Daft Punk right now.

176
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,580
Oh, okay.

177
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:57,140
For a second, I thought, I was like, wait, but he's an Oingo Boingo, not Daft Punk.

It'll be a good investment.

193
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,060
You can be Bart while you wait for Miku.

00:27:27,180 --> 00:28:34,200
levels the last two levels oh i never got that far oh you know yeah you're a quitter you're a pussy no i was a stupid kid that did listen back like this hit and run let me educate like the ones that are not aware this instant hit and run came out during a time when games had this cool thing called codes and those things were not something you paid for that were like dlc or anything you just inputted that on my pause menu and then you got to have fun did i ever play the story run no did i unlock all the cars and made them jump into the skies when you honk yes wait so you wait so you like you like missed out you didn't even experience the fun you didn't even experience the full experience of hit and run okay you could argue that you could argue that i didn't experience the full experience but i got the good part of it at least that is not true that is not you're not a real gamer until you beat uh so unless you're not a real gamer you're just opposing you were not molded and built from

196
00:28:34,200 --> 00:29:45,840
simpson hidden right you did not experience the the real childhood i i've i've been molded by plenty of other rage inducing games i think i'm good it's not the same it's not the same you lost a piece of you today okay just because of that you're gonna have i'm gonna have to like find a ps2 copy like i think it's on ps2 i used to play it on xbox just emulate i'm just gonna have to i don't know how to do that how do you how do you like i only know like emulators for like way way back in the day for like the game boy advance oh yeah yeah i know about that yeah we can say that that's about where where my knowledge knowledge ends that's actually my little my little programming knowledge is actually due to that oh yeah yeah oh my god i'm looking at dance emotes oh my god what the what the fuck what is the spark look at my dad watching you shop is this what this is yeah look at that look at him dance look oh do you see my kicks you see the kicks he has he's he has oh it's this they look they

You know, it was weird.

I have come to make an announcement.

203
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:51,880

I've seen it.

214
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:08,800

00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,760
I mean, Ninja makes sense.

310
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,360
You know, I wasn't a sponsor with Ninja.

311
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,980
I actually interacted with Ninja.

312
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,460
Oh, that's cool.

313
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,560
Yeah, I interacted with Marvel Rivals.

314
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,700
That's neat.

315
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,200
Yeah, I couldn't believe it.

316
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,120
Did you win?

317
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,180
Yeah, we won.

318
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,340
We were against XQC.

319
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:45,540
Bro.

320
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,000
You got that dub.

321
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,180
That's what I like to see.

322
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,400
Have you played Rivals or do you know like the gist of Marvel Rivals?

323
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,960
It just looks like Overwatch, but with Marvel.

324
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:55,940
Yeah, yeah, basically.

325
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,560
So there's this character called Penny Parker and like she has mines and stuff.

326
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,680
So there's a special.

327
00:39:02,820 --> 00:40:03,440
So we were doing a sponsor in Rivals where basically it's like street, like it was showcasing the newest season early and they were they wanted us to show this new game mode um where like you can play like the same like everyone can choose the same character so my team we were like let's all go penny parkers and we were defending so like penny parker her her one of her main abilities is that she can set up mines so there were six of us i don't like where this is going so so what we did was we just we just put mines on the entire point and no and like xc and his team could not breach the point they just kept exploding like they would come in and we just threw mines at them and because they couldn't walk anywhere and then they were like they were like those fucking cringe lords they tried so hard and then on our side we're like hit mine like They're like,

328
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,980
oh my god, these fucking try highs.

329
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:08,760
Like, they want to win so badly.

330
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,040
I love when things like that happen.

331
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:15,120
When you see, you just know that the other team is like, they're strategizing.

332
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,140
They're thinking of every possible move.

333
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:20,720
And then you see the other strategizing on the other team.

334
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:23,500
It's you guys going, mine, mine, mine.

335
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,680
Bro, the thing is, it's like, no, my team was.

336
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:31,520
It was me, Ninja, Tim the Tatman.

337
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:37,500
I was like, I was like, bro, what the fuck do you mean we're a tri-hiding?

338
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,820
I'm Ninja and Tim.

339
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,460
Like, we are not tri-hiding.

340
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,800
That sounds like a blast.

341
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,760
I'm kind of, I've been so out of it.

342
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,600
I haven't watched like, like barely any streamers.

343
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:53,180
Like my content, like as of, for the past six months, I'm not joking, has been YouTube shorts.

344
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,300
I've been watching so much YouTube shorts.

345
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:00,300
I have seen men in their backyard cook so much meat.

346
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,460
I've seen so much meat.

347
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,120
be cooked.

348
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,120
You have no idea.

349
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:05,920
No, I didn't.

350
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:06,860
I showed him.

351
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:10,980
I showed a screenshot of my YouTube shorts algorithm.

352
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,940
And he's like, oh, don't worry.

353
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,300
It'll get better soon.

354
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,800
Like, you just got to keep watching.

355
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:17,900
And then I was like, yeah, I was just like, oh, don't worry.

356
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,360
It's usually garbage in the beginning.

357
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:23,240
And once it gets used to what you like, like it'll start recommending you good stuff.

358
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:30,360
And so I'm just, when Doki just goes, oh, I'm like, that's like my whole shorts feed.

359
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,180
Like this is peak content.

360
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:36,540
I was like, yeah, this is, this is my algorithm.

361
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:40,440
I was like, what, I was like, what do you mean, Garbage?

362
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,060
I, I watch this all the time.

363
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,620
I see it and I can hear the AI voices.

364
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,280
They're just like from looking at it.

365
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:54,260
I can just like hear it like, when this happened, XYZ went on to be so.

366
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:57,600
The algorithm is not that bad.

367
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:02,500
I don't remember what my shirt, oh yeah, what my shirt.

368
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:33,560

It's like YouTube poop.

It's like the brain rot.

409
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:33,430
By the way, you guys can tell I had caffeine earlier before the stream.

410
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:35,190
Yeah, and she bites her lips, too.

00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:37,750
Why would you notice that?

00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:41,490
What are you paying attention to?

00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:52,490
Guys, she's holding a pen.

418
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:54,110
I know it looks like something else.

419
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:58,610
Now we know that Doki just casually looks at like Lego dances.

420
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:01,210
There's someone out there that's into that.

421
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:02,030
You know that, right?

422
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:03,950
Yeah, what's the term?

423
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:04,630
Bricked up?

424
00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:07,870
Yeah, so you know how there's like Minecraft porn?

425
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:17,810
you know there's someone out there unfortunately yeah see he knows about it so i'm not the freak here like i'm not the only freak here

426
00:45:22,370 --> 00:46:33,830
so see so i'm thinking if people can like you know you know with minecraft then like i won't be surprised it's also like you know as if we're supposed to relate yeah yeah you know what talking about guys you guys are you guys get it right i won't be surprised if they feel the same way with lego because they're both like blocky right so like it's the same thing that you know they're blocky minecraft is blocks lego's are blocks like would that like hit the same it's their minecraft lego it's like it's like game lego like it's like video game lego if you think about it i mean yeah but i meant like is there actually like properly licensed minecraft lego crossover there is there is okay i guess that makes sense i just haven't seen it oh no i've seen it as a connoisseur of uh minecraft because of course everyone knows me but for minecraft i haven't touched minecraft and god knows how every time i touch minecraft i commit a war crime apparently how would you like context would you i i'm i'm

427
00:46:33,830 --> 00:47:05,430
i'm i do but i'm also kind of scared the answer okay so like basically i have my own um smp server for my dragoons like for my members and um i i get on there once a month um to like to do normal things you know like make sure like define normal you know since i am the owner of the server i want to make sure that you know everybody pays their taxes and no one decreases the productivity value of doky land um spell with

428
00:47:09,470 --> 00:48:27,670
name um and you know trying to make sure that you know everyone is doing the right good good things i'm looking at your chat and like they're giving you they're giving you the eye right now crime you know when people commit crime you gotta you know you gotta teach them a lesson and you gotta see like there's like there's like you know okay so you know there's like you know uh because i the owner of the server i'm literally the um i am the authority maker as well you know i am the law obviously because like i am the law so i made a jail cell out of bedrock i see i made a jail cell out of bedrock does it have a door and each it's a jail cell okay that answers my question and like i you know i always i pay visit to the land of my people um just to be like hey like also i close the server because like i have loiterers there like i have actual like what's that word when people like live in your property um squatters yeah i have squatters so i had to close the server every time i visit the

429
00:48:27,670 --> 00:49:35,710
server so like they would literally squad on my land how does that happen in mine they would they yeah they squad on my land and i don't like that so so i've had your land it's not even like you found them in your attic it's just like get off of my property like every time i like kill them they come back for some reason so i started closing the server every time i do a little my little tour um you know like when i was gonna say when the queen but um long left the queen but when the king goes to the outside his castle and outside the palace um to like be like say hi to the people that's me uh but i close this like you know how i say hi to the people but there's like a giant gate blocking him from the people uh so you can only see him from like 10 miles away that's me when i come visit uh the server so you just see it like you know when you're playing left for dead and you just know that when there's like a big audio queue you know that there's a tank barrel barreling towards you that's

430
00:49:35,710 --> 00:50:52,330
basically what they feel they hear that sound effect in their heads and they just turn towards the skies knowing that someone is there i'm coming the duchess is coming she's gonna log in the server soon but yeah so um i would visit people's properties and to make sure um to make sure they don't mess with me i take i take a piece of their animal you know like you know like any of their pets or animals and then i put in my jail cell so like you know if anyone you know fucks with me and well it's like what do you mean it's like a hostage situation you know so like if they okay yeah like i need a bargain you mean by a piece you know like a piece what do you mean animal well okay it was like okay i had someone that committed a really bad crime on my server so basically i what like i locked him in my jail cell blowing his nose too aggressively no it was so bad it was really bad so i locked him in my cell but i put him in another miniature jail cell and i found where he lived um because i was

431
00:50:52,330 --> 00:50:59,790
like admins tell me where he lives and then like we TP to his land and we found out he owned a horse.

432
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:03,870
So I took his horse.

433
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:05,470
And that was his sin.

434
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:14,950
So I took his horse and I TPed it back to the jail cell and then I was like, say you're sorry.

435
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:17,090
And he refused to say sorry.

436
00:51:17,730 --> 00:51:20,850
So I killed the horse in front of him and

437
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:49,450
I killed the horse in front of him i'll say and to teach him a lesson um i got a picture frame and i hanged a piece of the horse on all four sides so whenever he turns around he'll see this dead horse wherever he goes anyway i have i come on the server once a month so i'll see i'll come back next month to see if he's sorry

438
00:51:52,740 --> 00:53:00,640
i'm not sure what to say to that like the thing is as it was going on i was just kind of like okay this seems like you're like your usual dokey affair and i was a little bit amused then when you said tp the horse i thought oh i had like i know you mean teleport but i just imagine you like wrapping it in toilet paper and that would have been you know that would have been mischievous enough and then as it goes on it's just like i just saw like just to fade in across your model just as you kept that sentence just kept going oh my god there it is there it is there's eric i see him i see now i'm hearing him you're like there's no way she could possibly make it worse but no okay look i had to make an example of him because if i make an example of this really bad criminal like now my kingdom knows not to mess with me it happened to you too like i will find your pet i i know where i know where all of my people live

439
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:11,520
so it reminded me to whenever if i ever play minecraft with you make sure that you're not to the admin of the server world

440
00:53:15,920 --> 00:54:12,220
Jesus Christ Also, I know I know the influx Also, like before I did all of that I was turning random people's builds into bedrock Just for fun I was like This building over there Turn it into bedrock And just like Out of morbid scientific curiosity Yeah What like what is this game you what is this what do you get at it's just fun you know it's just it's just and they couldn't do anything about it because the server was closed so so they could just watch me turn their turn their entire home into bedrock they also built okay they committed the greatest crime too in my server they built pray tell what did they do lower the prop my property value of jokilon How did they do that?

441
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:21,400
They built a fucking graveyard next to my land of some apparent crime, like a crime that they falsely accused me of.

442
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,420
Like it's not my fault they died.

443
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:28,240
So I turned their church into a bedrock.

444
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:39,980
To be fair, churches tend to be built out of very sturdy materials so that they stand for a very long time.

445
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:41,940
Okay, you see?

446
00:54:45,220 --> 00:55:10,620
but churches used to be called sanctuaries and technically a wall will mean that it's a very yeah safe sanctuary safe for no one because no one could get in but yeah so now i won't be able to i'm trying i'm trying to work with me here look it's their fault they lowered my property value i was there first i cleaned that land first so like i put and also walled it off so i won't have

447
00:55:14,520 --> 00:56:25,480
so that's what you just like whoever the architect was for this rubbish yeah exactly i said i was like how dare you what have you tried really hard they try they try to lower my property but they try to falsely accuse me of a crime that i did not commit so in my eyes that's ugly they even wrote a book too they're like look at all these drag oh no they that i took the book they made the dokey compendium i took the book and i put it in my jail cell so no one can access required reading yeah no so no one can access it because only winners write the history i mean technically yeah if play if playing military shooters on the play on the xbox 360 taught me anything it's that history is written by the victors so exactly so it was unsanctioned writing it was an unsanctioned book i did not approve of this book and then it was and put it in my jail cell so no one can access it apparently i found out the admin undid the bedrock for the church because i it was you know um unjust which i don't know

448
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:43,800
what that means uh okay which i don't know this word i don't fucking know what he meant by that so the church was restored apparently but that doesn't mean like that's not going to stop me.

449
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:47,630
I'll come back next month to do something about it.

450
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:57,460
It's just like a month a monthly sort of like calamity that pulls through.

451
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:58,820
Yeah, Geneva Convention.

452
00:56:59,140 --> 00:56:59,920
What the fuck is that?

453
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:03,180
This is Minecraft not New York City where the UN is.

454
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:07,960
Like we there's no United Nations in my server.

455
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:12,240
They're limited to space.

456
00:57:12,240 --> 00:58:08,480
all right i have bart bart in a some sort of i don't know if that that's his like go cart or something that turns into a mech oh yeah oh yeah yeah apparently because like he's too short they do that for like short characters if they're too short they put him in a fucking mech suit for some reason because for the hitbox yeah it's for like the hitbox and everything because that's what they did for rick and morty there's rick and morty man i don't know anything dude they have everything they have like i wish i got the reef i'm sad i missed out on the halloween skins because i really wanted the repo skin so badly like when they start dancing it's so silly all right let me i don't think i've seen that wait you haven't okay guys give me a second this is very important yo we're never gonna get started it's a one hour intro before we go into the simpsons okay repo dance important i also show it to you guys too

457
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:51,200
they don't make music like that anymore i feel like like really catchy openings yeah it's because like it's only written by like people who are really good at piano and like are trained in like classical composing so but most people these days are just they sit down at a computer and press a few buttons i should know yeah or they just don't do openings anymore because they're like we gotta go to the show so i sent it to the chat first before i sent it to you because they deserve it more what in the world is this it's reborn fortnite skin

458
00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:24,320
that's why i was so sad i hope it comes back to the store they even put the among us they put the among us backpack back in the store too and i still missed it out i'm not so busy i'm so sad the among us i'm so puzzled at what it is that i'm seeing yeah look how tall that's what i'm saying they have to make them tall for the hitbox huh they have to make it so i'm sorry i'm just mesmerized by this dance

459
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:37,400
it's so good i like the comments you see the comments of no i don't i don't have tiktoks i can't open oh don't worry i got you

460
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:43,160
Oh, I got you.

461
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:43,820
Oh, yeah.

462
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:49,140
Yesterday, after Zandu made his tweet, he went off the grid again.

463
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:55,180
And then I was like, I was like, do I want to see the fan art of all the people that drew you since you returned?

464
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:58,120
I was just like sending him screenshots of like.

465
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:02,760
I'm, yeah, I'm not in like any sort of like headspace to be on social media or anything like that.

466
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:07,000
So I've just been like, if I ever need to do anything, it's just like, goodbye.

467
01:00:07,660 --> 01:01:22,320
And then I go back to watching television television so joki was so so nice and just like hey i know that you're staying away for your own good and everything but here's some pretty art and i'm like oh thank you people are so nice and then and then here's strobe yeah and then this strobe why are there so many of these why is this a okay so i at least i'm not the only one that thought of patrick from yeah it looks like that it's just like star me all right i'm wait i almost invited this random random dude on my friend's list i don't know i invite tapari i should also let me change make sure that the connection is also uh i'll do east coast uh so it's in the meta great god i need to remember how to wait how do i change my ping okay matchmaking yeah don't need to do west coast i don't even know like if that's how to do it oh if you're wondering why i'm level two it's because i played a test game oh yeah yeah we're gonna i'm so happy that you're level two so we can go against bots yeah i

468
01:01:22,320 --> 01:02:25,080
forgot about that look at the map look at it isn't that cool it is pretty cool isn't this cool the fact that fortnite has turned into like this grand crossover event that we never really brothers is actually kind of cool i never imagined this is the kind of direction it would take yeah i think the biggest mistake was that they made fortnite competitive i think it being a casual game is just to fuck with like just to fuck around is what makes fortnite fortnite did you know they had a game that's why zero build is king yeah i don't know this is okay i don't know this zero build i don't know if they have zero is this zero build they do they do okay no but for the simpsons oh they do i check that oh thank god nice like they had a i don't know you know this a game mode where it was like um it was like uh a game mode i'm trying to explain it basically like your goal is to be the to like work together as a team with mics to be like the last one alive so you have to like ally with people and

469
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:37,820
be like you're on a team you want a team no kill no kill don't kill me let's work together and then like they work hard to like not kill any like to like be alive and not kill anyone with mics and everything and yeah it's called the lulu yeah

470
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:45,220
How often does it actually work?

471
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:47,060
How often does it actually work?

472
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:51,840
If you win, if you get, if you win, you get like this like special umbrella or something.

473
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:53,820
Also, I've accidentally dropped this into build.

474
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:55,740
So, oh, yay.

475
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:56,540
Yay.

476
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:59,240
I have no idea how to build it, Fortnite.

477
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:01,000
Me either.

478
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:01,740
Yay.

479
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:04,480
We've only played zero build.

480
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,200
I played zero build and only up, and I'm already stuck.

481
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:11,300
Oh, I, no, no.

482
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,460
And the Uno one.

483
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:14,540
I don't remember.

484
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:15,260
Oh, yeah.

485
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:16,180
I forgot about that one.

486
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:17,760
I don't remember what we said, too.

487
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:20,480
I remember I told no one about it.

488
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:20,680
I'm stuck.

489
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:23,780
I'd be like, I don't tell anyone how to Uno.

490
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:25,360
Oh, my God.

491
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:28,180
My sensitivity is like...

492
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:28,620
Whatever.

493
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:29,840
It's...

494
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:30,140
It's...

01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:21,660
It hasn't been the same since the accident.

610
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:38,540

611
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:40,680
like an apartment, like a new apartment building.

612
01:16:40,860 --> 01:16:43,800
It's entirely gentrified, and they're charging me $1,500 a month.

613
01:16:43,820 --> 01:16:46,140
Yeah, exactly.

614

01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:50,660
How do I activate this?

617
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:53,200

And just like, I did it.

01:27:16,300 --> 01:27:17,680
No land for you.

786
01:27:17,940 --> 01:27:19,160

Yeah, that's right.

796
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:30,040
Clean the beaches.

797
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:32,840
We don't want decomposing bodies in the water.

798
01:27:33,260 --> 01:27:33,940
That ain't cool.

799
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:35,100

He won.

803
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:41,260
He won the AI wars.

804
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:45,900
Oh, he default danced on me.

805
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:46,840
Oh, my God.

806
01:27:46,900 --> 01:27:48,140
Wait, is he a real person?

807
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:49,120
Wait.

808
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:49,960
No, I don't think so.

809
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:51,500

810
01:27:53,180 --> 01:27:54,860

01:27:57,480 --> 01:28:06,120

01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:06,360

01:28:06,460 --> 01:28:07,360

How old are you?

818
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:13,940
No, it's not appropriate to ask.

01:33:05,490 --> 01:33:06,730
But then I was like, oh yeah, Lonely Island.

833
01:33:07,370 --> 01:33:08,910
Okay, I'm going to show you the song.

834
01:33:09,110 --> 01:33:10,690
I'm going to let you listen to the song.

835
01:33:11,030 --> 01:33:14,570
And then like, um, oh my God, I almost posted it somewhere else.

836
01:33:14,850 --> 01:33:16,390
Okay, I'm going to let you listen to the song.

837
01:33:16,970 --> 01:33:51,100
lonely island was like 2014 and then like um and then i was decided to sing this on stream not remembering i gotta watch this ad about eating crisps yeah look he's like so out of it he's like he's literally like 10 years behind meme culture right now i'm catching him up on everything he's missed out i've never seen this you've never seen okay listen to the lyrics I got the Zambubu,

838
01:33:51,640 --> 01:33:53,600
Zambu, Zambu, Zambu.

839
01:33:59,630 --> 01:34:01,830
This is very important.

840
01:34:04,230 --> 01:34:08,430
Jesus, okay, 36 seconds of that is about as much as I think that I am okay.

841
01:34:08,470 --> 01:34:10,990
Yeah, yeah, I sang the entire, I didn't stop.

842
01:34:11,090 --> 01:34:13,290
I was like, I ain't no pussy, I don't back down.

843
01:34:14,710 --> 01:34:15,930
You know what's crazy?

844
01:34:17,230 --> 01:34:20,550
The, wait, I don't think, wait, let me see if the, if the video is demonized.

845
01:34:21,330 --> 01:34:22,270
I'm going to check.

846
01:34:23,030 --> 01:34:24,870
Because I don't think it got demonetized.

847
01:34:25,310 --> 01:34:31,410
Oh yeah, what's funny was that people were like, oh no, it was got demonetized.

848
01:34:31,510 --> 01:34:34,570
No, of course it did because I sang some crazy songs there.

849
01:34:34,990 --> 01:34:41,210
But what's crazy was, what's funny was that, you know how I did like, I did, I brought back Doka Field.

850
01:34:42,790 --> 01:34:46,190
I don't know if you know Doka Field, but every Halloween.

851
01:34:46,350 --> 01:34:47,550
What in the gnome?

852
01:34:47,750 --> 01:34:49,670
Oh, you don't know Doka Field, my hero.

853
01:34:52,390 --> 01:34:54,570
There's clearly a lot of things I don't know.

854
01:34:54,810 --> 01:34:57,030
I'll catch up on it for you.

855
01:34:57,250 --> 01:35:01,970
But like, here, here is...

856
01:35:01,970 --> 01:35:07,330
Oh, also, there's a game where it's like Sands and Garfield.

857
01:35:07,430 --> 01:35:10,850
It's like a Sands fight, but with Garfield.

858
01:35:11,330 --> 01:35:13,370
And it was the worst hour of my life.

859
01:35:13,630 --> 01:35:15,010
But anyway, that doesn't matter.

860
01:35:16,170 --> 01:35:17,730
A whole hour.

861
01:35:20,570 --> 01:35:27,810
I can't, okay, wait, I can switch to, okay, wait, I can, okay, I'll show you it, and then.

862
01:35:27,810 --> 01:35:32,290
I'm giving you so much ad revenue, I just want you to know this, like, I'm watching so many ads.

863
01:35:32,530 --> 01:35:37,090
Well, you're giving the ads, you're giving the ads to the music right holders, so not me.

864
01:35:38,370 --> 01:35:39,330
I see.

865
01:35:39,590 --> 01:35:48,890
Not even me, I don't even get anything out of it, that's, but, um, wait, give me a sec, let me.

866
01:35:49,450 --> 01:35:49,850
Man.

867
01:35:51,190 --> 01:35:56,950
Isn't it funny that you didn't do the Garfield thing on a Monday because then you could have said man I hate Mondays, but it's Monday.

868
01:35:57,210 --> 01:35:59,890
It's Monday every day in Dokefield universe.

869
01:36:00,330 --> 01:36:03,210
So La booboo, la booboo.

870
01:36:07,930 --> 01:36:09,830
I mean the way you made just

871
01:36:18,750 --> 01:36:20,470
So every Halloween

872
01:36:25,110 --> 01:36:25,630
days.

873
01:36:31,450 --> 01:36:34,310
I actually don't know what Garfield sounds like.

874
01:36:34,790 --> 01:36:39,630
Oh, he sounds like that guy in Ghostbusters, the main guy from Ghostbusters.

875
01:36:39,850 --> 01:36:41,150
Oh my God, what was his name?

876
01:36:41,530 --> 01:36:42,110
Bill Murray.

877
01:36:42,350 --> 01:36:42,530
Bill Murray.

878
01:36:42,690 --> 01:36:43,750
Yeah, he's literally Bill Murray.

879
01:36:43,970 --> 01:36:46,930
Like, that's his voice because Bill Murray actually played Garfield.

880
01:36:49,430 --> 01:36:50,430
Wait, that was him?

881
01:36:50,690 --> 01:36:51,730
Yes, it's Bill Murray.

882
01:36:52,230 --> 01:36:52,730
It's literally his voice.

883
01:36:52,730 --> 01:36:54,410
I've never seen the live action.

884
01:36:54,430 --> 01:37:22,570
version in english when i when i saw it it was dubbed oh yeah no this is no it's actually even like in the cartoon animated ones it's also bill murray and then what's my favorite people were like how did she get the how does she get the rights like permission from jim davis to do this and i'm like it's how it's parody law i'm dope if you i'm legally distinct

885
01:37:25,750 --> 01:37:30,390
As I saw it, like, I was like, how did she get the permissions from Jim Davis to do this?

886
01:37:30,510 --> 01:37:31,730
I'm like, happy Halloween.

887
01:37:32,150 --> 01:37:33,530
This is my Halloween costume.

888
01:37:35,950 --> 01:37:38,290
I mean, that's one way of thinking about it.

889
01:37:39,610 --> 01:37:42,430
I mean, I guess I dressed up as a strawberry.

890
01:37:42,950 --> 01:37:45,830
Not on my own terms, but here I am.

891
01:37:47,010 --> 01:37:47,530
Happy Halloween.

892
01:37:48,030 --> 01:37:48,930
Happy Halloween.

893
01:37:50,710 --> 01:37:51,850
I'm la-poop-poop.

894
01:37:51,910 --> 01:37:52,250
Oh, my God.

895
01:37:52,290 --> 01:37:53,670
Now that song stuck in my head now.

896
01:38:00,460 --> 01:38:02,580
Oh, it's like a Sonic OC.

897
01:38:03,140 --> 01:38:03,640
Oh, my God.

898
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:06,200
Okay, since your hyperfixation is Sonic.

899
01:38:07,120 --> 01:38:07,840
Okay, whoa there.

900
01:38:08,060 --> 01:38:12,200
Like, okay, let's not call it just whatever we want, okay.

901
01:38:12,660 --> 01:38:13,540
Okay, what do we call it?

902
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:14,240
What do we call it?

903
01:38:15,560 --> 01:38:18,120
I just like Sonic.

904
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:19,020
Sonic's cool.

905
01:38:19,700 --> 01:38:23,440
Look, I am honest with myself about my hyperfixations.

906
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:27,300
I also don't want to misuse the word.

907
01:38:27,340 --> 01:39:23,980
because like i don't know what like okay okay okay since you know a lot about sonic do you know okay i'm gonna test your sonic lure do you know storm the albatross of course he's probably part of the babylon rogues made his debut in sonic riders bro what the fuck bro okay okay but how many how many he have on rule 34 though now why would you think i know that not a real sonic fan not not a real okay i don't concern myself with that part of the fandom not a real one a true sonic fan will know everything about no no no like the thing is i am aware of it not by choice mind you i have seen

908
01:39:27,800 --> 01:40:25,480
you know what yeah wait what have you seen what have you seen I'm not gonna say what have you seen things I should not have seen at the time that I saw them give me an example you type no I'm not gonna give you an example you can type it to me and then I'll read it out loud no I am not even doing that because I do not trust you that information will not stay with you okay what if how about we do true for it how about you like describe it to me i will just say i i saw i saw things i should not have seen did not want to see if you're thinking sonic's dreams collection you're thinking in the right way and i i do not care to see any more of it oh so like you know like when we were inside the character well not not that i mean i'm sure that exists too or is the feet one I mean,

909
01:40:25,620 --> 01:40:26,720
there haven't been a few of those.

910
01:40:27,140 --> 01:40:27,540
Whoa!

911
01:40:29,900 --> 01:40:33,580
It's literally, like, if, okay, so let me put you on some game.

912
01:40:34,020 --> 01:40:37,660
So, back in the day, there used to be this parody series called Sonic Shorts.

913
01:40:37,780 --> 01:40:42,060
It was basically, like, these flash animations on Newgrounds that just made fun of the franchise.

914
01:40:42,620 --> 01:40:46,880
And for whatever reason, gross-out humor was really popular with that.

915
01:40:46,900 --> 01:40:47,340
I still is.

916
01:40:47,340 --> 01:40:52,380
And one of the things, yeah, and one of the things that they just kept focusing on was stinky feet.

917
01:40:54,940 --> 01:40:58,360
Not only like this, but like old children's cartoons.

918
01:40:58,940 --> 01:41:06,740
There's so much of it that I think that someone on the storyboard team was doing side quests during the production of these episodes.

919
01:41:07,640 --> 01:41:20,880
Oh, so you think they were like, oh my God, it's like, it's like Knuckles with his like, you know, like the comic book artist, the one that drew like Knuckles with his Knuckles, and it was like Nipples.

920
01:41:21,060 --> 01:41:24,640
Oh, Tyson Hess, the guy that's currently like one of the main designers.

921
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:24,920
Yeah.

922
01:41:24,940 --> 01:42:37,820
currently the main comic it's like that like his comic is technically canon now if you think about it if you think about it any art he's done is official now because he is an official sonic artist i mean you can't just retroactively canonize things if i if i was an artist who was a fan of something and then became an official artist of it i would canonize everything i've done i mean i do like when people sort of do references to like their like their personal work even when they're doing something big i i think a one of the examples would be like the director of the first shazam movie if you've seen it oh no but like i've heard of it yeah but the director swedish dude and randomly when i was watching the movie like on one of the monitors i just saw an animation that I saw as a kid and I'm like hold on a second what the heck was that turns out he he made it and that funny net animation you just put it in Shazam as a Easter egg and I was like oh that's cool I like that that's cute like

923
01:42:37,820 --> 01:42:55,320
just be like I've made this so that's what you would do with Sonic yeah all of your OCs yeah I'll be like he's real now also got ready up bro this is why we've been in the main oh sorry sorry sorry my beat my beat We've been waiting for him to ready up.

924
01:42:55,560 --> 01:42:56,540
That's a sound guy.

925
01:42:56,640 --> 01:43:00,900
I don't know if you said upies one more time, but if I already did the upies yet or not.

926
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:02,200
I don't know.

927
01:43:05,550 --> 01:43:06,310
Wait, that's good.

928
01:43:06,370 --> 01:43:07,950
Wait, where is it?

929
01:43:07,970 --> 01:43:09,250
Oh my gosh, watch this.

930
01:43:10,530 --> 01:43:11,770
What am I watching now?

931
01:43:13,950 --> 01:43:16,850
Oh yeah, another person that did that was Toby Fox.

932
01:43:16,910 --> 01:43:20,050
He put like a homestuck thing into Pokemon.

933
01:43:20,390 --> 01:43:21,110
Oh yeah.

934
01:43:21,670 --> 01:43:32,690
I love it whenever he like talks in japanese because he always says one word in english what was that famous quote i forgot uh

935
01:43:40,790 --> 01:44:24,010

937
01:44:25,690 --> 01:44:26,970
I cannot do any sims, this boy.

938
01:44:27,110 --> 01:44:27,590
I'm going to stop.

939
01:44:29,010 --> 01:44:29,490
It's okay.

940
01:44:29,630 --> 01:44:30,850
See, you do it better than me.

941
01:44:31,070 --> 01:44:32,890
No, we're only good at Marge.

942
01:44:34,710 --> 01:44:35,550
Yeah, apparently.

943
01:44:36,410 --> 01:44:36,930
Marge is where we eat.

944
01:44:36,930 --> 01:44:37,930
That is where we excel.

945
01:44:38,110 --> 01:44:39,470
Marge and nothing else.

946
01:44:39,890 --> 01:44:42,370
So many people want to eat the rich right now.

947
01:44:42,690 --> 01:44:44,210
I think they might be real people.

948
01:44:44,310 --> 01:44:45,350
I think they might be real.

949
01:44:45,950 --> 01:44:46,510
Yes, they are.

950
01:44:46,630 --> 01:44:46,770
They are.

951
01:44:46,990 --> 01:44:47,690
Oh, my God.

952
01:44:48,230 --> 01:44:49,130
Oh, my God.

953
01:44:49,270 --> 01:44:50,510
We're not ready for this.

954
01:44:50,690 --> 01:44:52,290
Wait, I just wanted to explore.

955
01:44:52,710 --> 01:44:53,130

Wait, wait.

960
01:45:26,670 --> 01:45:27,130
Oh my God.

01:45:28,130 --> 01:45:30,530
Oh, we're crumping it.

962
01:45:30,610 --> 01:45:34,040

Am I hit it here.

966
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:43,400
Am I hit it now, Zadu?

967
01:45:45,060 --> 01:45:46,720
It's your favorite.

968
01:45:46,940 --> 01:45:47,360
It's your favorite.

969
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:48,060
Am I hit now, Zadu?

970
01:45:48,100 --> 01:45:50,360
This is what the internet was made for.

971
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:55,180
Oh, hey, my.

972
01:45:55,220 --> 01:45:59,360
He's like, yeah, like, your bone's dead and we're just trying enough.

973
01:45:59,620 --> 01:46:01,280
He's just like, oh, there's the dog.

974
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:02,520
The dog is on the floor.

975
01:46:02,860 --> 01:46:03,380
Oh, my God.

976
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:03,820
Sorry.

977
01:46:04,020 --> 01:46:04,540
Goodbye, Miku.

978
01:46:06,700 --> 01:46:07,580
Goodbye, Miku.

979
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:10,420
It had to be done.

980
01:46:11,260 --> 01:46:11,500
All right.

981
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:12,260
I'm not.

982
01:46:12,380 --> 01:46:13,700
I'm hydrating real quick.

983
01:46:13,720 --> 01:46:14,180

Progressively, like, getting a little bit better.

Okay, wait.

998
01:47:37,660 --> 01:47:39,320
I'm a little scared.

999
01:47:40,900 --> 01:47:42,340
It'll be fine.

1000
01:47:42,760 --> 01:47:43,340
Will I?

1001
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:47,900
Oh my god, I ran out of bullets.

1002
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:49,340
No!

1003
01:47:49,960 --> 01:47:50,240
No!

1004
01:47:50,660 --> 01:47:51,680
Oh, there were two people.

1005
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:52,720
I was not winning this.

1006
01:47:53,480 --> 01:47:54,000
I...

1007
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:54,520
Hey, Karamo!

1008
01:47:55,100 --> 01:47:55,360
No!

1009
01:47:56,160 --> 01:48:01,460
Okay, so that's why I was assigned to name Fortnite Monday.

1010
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:04,000
And the thing...

1011
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:09,120
The first clip I showed, Zandu, was...

1012
01:48:09,120 --> 01:48:12,240
I was like, you've never seen a clip named three women?

1013
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:13,400
Like...

1014
01:48:13,400 --> 01:48:15,980
And I have no idea what you were talking about.

1015
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,160
but like, what do you mean?

1016
01:48:17,620 --> 01:48:18,620
Name three women.

1017
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:24,000
I was like, just like and I'm like, Shannon, name three women right now.

1018
01:48:24,180 --> 01:48:25,360
Name .

1019
01:48:25,360 --> 01:48:25,780
Me?

1020
01:48:26,260 --> 01:48:28,920
Yeah, name three women right now.

1021
01:48:28,920 --> 01:48:29,340
Three women.

1022
01:48:29,880 --> 01:48:32,680
Oh, the Miku, Meiko, and Gumi.

1023
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:35,620
Yeah, all right, name three real women.

1024
01:48:36,500 --> 01:48:39,080
Are you telling me they are not real, Dokye?

1025
01:48:39,140 --> 01:48:40,860
Are you telling me they are not real?

1026
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:55,880
Bro, I hate to break it to you, but- Break what I'm so sorry to tell you this I'm so sorry Okay, Elbardo.

1027
01:48:56,500 --> 01:48:59,740
Let's go I'm so sorry.

1028
01:49:00,140 --> 01:49:00,200
All right.

1029
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:03,060
Why are you still like blurred out in the lobby?

1030
01:49:03,460 --> 01:49:05,020
Why are you you haven't ready?

1031
01:49:05,260 --> 01:49:06,920
Oh my god Did you go back to your lobby?

1032
01:49:07,260 --> 01:49:07,880
Did you go?

1033
01:49:08,200 --> 01:49:10,460
I thought that's what you're supposed to do.

1034
01:49:10,460 --> 01:49:10,460
What you're supposed to do?

1035
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:18,380
Okay The fact that you are delaying this and can't even name me three women?

1036
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:19,760
I gave you an answer.

1037
01:49:19,980 --> 01:49:21,380
You're just not happy with it.

1038
01:49:21,780 --> 01:49:23,480
You're just not happy with it.

1039
01:49:23,480 --> 01:49:25,360
You literally named three virtual...

1040
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:30,320
You named three virtual women and one of them wasn't even me.

1041
01:49:30,700 --> 01:49:32,420
That is so fucked up.

1042
01:49:32,420 --> 01:49:33,620
How can they be virtual?

1043
01:49:33,820 --> 01:49:36,820
How can they be virtually if I have seen them live, Gedokie?

1044
01:49:38,760 --> 01:49:40,040
Yes, but were they...

1045
01:49:40,040 --> 01:49:44,280
Okay, name three 4D dimensional women.

1046
01:49:45,100 --> 01:49:45,660
4D?

1047
01:49:46,460 --> 01:49:51,000
Because if I say 3D, I don't even know what that extra dimension is supposed to look like.

1048
01:49:53,400 --> 01:49:56,840
Name me three 4D women.

1049
01:49:57,140 --> 01:49:59,860
Because if I say 3D, you'd be like,

1050
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:05,840
Is she 3D though?

1051
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:08,660
I mean, sometimes she is, other times she's 2D.

1052
01:50:09,080 --> 01:50:11,480
Name me three 3D women.

1053
01:50:12,940 --> 01:50:14,300
Three 3D women.

1054
01:50:14,700 --> 01:50:15,780
Yeah, flesh women.

1055
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:46,420
portman not made of natalie portman since you natalie portman yeah i'm setting the board apparently i'm setting the bar yeah like oh yeah like i don't know i think i could top that uh lady gaga is pretty cool all right and if lastly like i don't know who who did i hear on radio last time but my least the fact that you had to that was an instant and also like i'm here and i wasn't even Okay,

1056
01:50:47,160 --> 01:50:49,660
but Doki, you said name three women.

1057
01:50:50,680 --> 01:50:52,400
And what the fuck, Emma?

1058
01:50:53,940 --> 01:50:55,360
You're one of the bros.

1059
01:50:55,500 --> 01:50:56,040
Oh, that's true.

1060
01:50:56,140 --> 01:50:56,880
Good answer.

1061
01:50:57,100 --> 01:50:58,660
Good, good answer.

1062
01:50:59,480 --> 01:51:00,020
You're right.

1063
01:51:00,220 --> 01:51:06,180
Like, for example, if I'm hanging out with the homies and one of them just goes, name three dudes, I'm not naming any of them.

1064
01:51:06,700 --> 01:51:07,140
That's fucked up.

1065
01:51:07,540 --> 01:51:08,440
Why, am I not a dude?

1066
01:51:08,540 --> 01:51:10,360
I'm just going to say, like, no, you're not.

1067
01:51:10,500 --> 01:51:11,440
You're a loser.

1068
01:51:11,780 --> 01:51:13,260
This is what I would tell my friends.

1069
01:51:15,080 --> 01:51:15,480
Bro.

1070
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:19,140
That's that's do do the bro.

1071
01:51:19,260 --> 01:51:19,700
You're right.

1072
01:51:20,060 --> 01:51:21,320
I'd be like bro.

1073
01:51:21,440 --> 01:51:25,440
I'd never think about you No jokes on you.

1074
01:51:25,540 --> 01:51:28,200
I don't never think about you either and that's how it goes.

1075
01:51:28,540 --> 01:51:30,940
Yeah, yeah That's what you know, that's a homie also.

1076

Alright, Geronimo.

I'm gonna go to Moe.

1102
01:56:50,060 --> 01:56:50,600
What is this?

1103
01:56:50,640 --> 01:56:52,020
I'm gonna go to this random shop.

1104
01:56:53,900 --> 01:56:55,420
Moe's now with electricity.

1105
01:56:55,820 --> 01:56:56,700
Oh my god, there's Finn.

1106
01:56:58,600 --> 01:57:00,220
Oh my god, Finn's coming over.

1107
01:57:01,100 --> 01:57:01,900
Oh my god.

1108
01:57:02,240 --> 01:57:03,640
Oh my god, this is not fair.

1109
01:57:03,700 --> 01:57:04,760
Oh my god, I got killed by Finn.

1110
01:57:05,160 --> 01:57:06,100
I got killed by Finn.

1111
01:57:07,100 --> 01:57:07,600
Who's Finn?

1112
01:57:07,940 --> 01:57:09,080
From Adventure Time.

1113
01:57:09,200 --> 01:57:10,000
What do you mean?

1114
01:57:10,080 --> 01:57:11,260
I don't watch Adventure Time.

1115
01:57:12,360 --> 01:57:13,920
What is wrong with you?

1116
01:57:15,060 --> 01:57:15,720
I've never seen it.

1117
01:57:15,900 --> 01:57:17,700
What is wrong with you?

1118
01:57:18,400 --> 01:57:19,160
What is...

1119
01:57:20,160 --> 01:57:21,440
No, Finn the human.

1120
01:57:21,680 --> 01:57:22,440
He's too strong.

1121
01:57:22,540 --> 01:57:23,820
It's because he's a real person.

1122
01:57:24,320 --> 01:57:28,340
Bro, I'm watching one of our buddies and he's just eating crusty burgers.

1123
01:57:30,020 --> 01:57:31,240
Literally, that's all he's been eating.

1124
01:57:31,460 --> 01:57:32,400
He's eating crusty burgers right now.

1125
01:57:32,600 --> 01:57:33,680
Yeah, bro, I'm dead.

1126
01:57:33,860 --> 01:57:35,340
Why are you eating crusty burgers?

1127
01:57:35,700 --> 01:57:36,280
I see Finn.

1128
01:57:36,720 --> 01:57:37,520
Yeah, no, be careful.

1129
01:57:37,640 --> 01:57:38,700
He's gonna fuck you up.

1130
01:57:39,260 --> 01:57:40,000
Yeah, I told you.

1131
01:57:40,100 --> 01:57:40,480
Yeah, I told you.

1132
01:57:41,360 --> 01:57:41,880
Jesus.

1133
01:57:42,340 --> 01:57:44,320
He shotgunned me so quickly.

1134
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:44,380
I'm broke.

1135
01:57:44,680 --> 01:57:46,740

The bounty has been posted.

1155
02:00:03,980 --> 02:00:05,240
The thing, what is the bounty?

1156
02:00:05,300 --> 02:00:07,400
What do they get if somebody actually succeeds?

1157
02:00:08,160 --> 02:00:09,120
Our recognition.

1158
02:00:10,180 --> 02:00:11,160
Oh, okay.

1159
02:00:11,720 --> 02:00:15,160
Zandu and I will call out your name, Exposure.

02:00:17,360 --> 02:00:18,840
Speak my name, streamer.

02:00:19,020 --> 02:00:21,420
Yeah, acknowledge me.

1162
02:00:22,120 --> 02:00:24,500
All right, I'm going to let our teammates decide where to go.

1163
02:00:27,340 --> 02:00:27,960
Okay, Led...

1164
02:00:27,960 --> 02:00:28,720

1165
02:00:29,260 --> 02:00:29,660
I'm...

1166
02:00:29,660 --> 02:00:30,240
Oh, wait, wait.

1167
02:00:30,400 --> 02:00:31,460
Our guys jumped.

1168
02:00:31,560 --> 02:00:31,980
Wait a minute.

1169
02:00:32,040 --> 02:00:32,820
They already jumped.

1170
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:33,820
They went to...

1171
02:00:33,820 --> 02:00:36,800
They went to the Springfield Town Square again.

1172
02:00:37,540 --> 02:00:39,320
I did not have a good time on Town Square.

1173
02:00:39,460 --> 02:00:40,340
That's all I'm going to say.

1174
02:00:40,360 --> 02:00:41,300
Is this the tilted towers of Springfield?

1175
02:00:41,500 --> 02:00:42,820
This is literally Tilted Tower.

1176
02:00:42,920 --> 02:00:46,280
No, this is actually Tilted Towers, but I do not have fun in this Tilted Towers.

1177
02:00:48,520 --> 02:00:50,180
I do not have fun here.

1178
02:00:50,280 --> 02:00:51,180
Oh, for God's sakes.

1179
02:00:54,480 --> 02:00:55,560
I do not like this.

1180
02:00:56,100 --> 02:00:56,600
I'm afraid.

1181
02:00:56,900 --> 02:00:57,540
I am associated.

1182
02:00:57,560 --> 02:00:58,220
I do not have a gun.

1183
02:00:59,160 --> 02:01:03,680
I have a gold gun, but I feel like I'm going to get fucked up with this gold gun.

1184
02:01:08,440 --> 02:01:09,680
God, I'm so scared.

1185
02:01:10,640 --> 02:01:12,440
There are a lot of people around me.

1186
02:01:17,540 --> 02:01:18,760
I'm in so much trouble.

1187
02:01:19,100 --> 02:01:20,600
Bro, I'm in so much trouble, too, bro.

1188
02:01:21,600 --> 02:01:23,780
There's people literally above me right now.

1189
02:01:24,300 --> 02:01:24,480
Oh, my God.

1190
02:01:24,520 --> 02:01:25,040
Hatsune Miku.

1191
02:01:25,580 --> 02:01:26,020
Oh, my God.

1192
02:01:26,140 --> 02:01:27,380
This is a good Hatsune Miku.

1193
02:01:27,600 --> 02:01:28,080
Hatsune Miku.

1194
02:01:28,200 --> 02:01:29,020
Kill the guy in front of me.

1195
02:01:29,100 --> 02:01:29,360
No, no, no.

1196
02:01:29,480 --> 02:01:30,180
This is a good one.

1197
02:01:30,460 --> 02:01:31,360
No, Zendu.

1198
02:01:31,480 --> 02:01:32,900
How could you kill Hatsune Miku?

1199
02:01:33,140 --> 02:01:34,080
Sorry about it.

1200
02:01:35,840 --> 02:01:37,840
How could you do this to her?

1201
02:01:38,360 --> 02:01:39,340
She's your idol.

1202
02:01:39,560 --> 02:01:41,180
She was the woman you named.

02:02:45,840 --> 02:02:47,640

Oh, put on the default skin.

1208
02:02:51,460 --> 02:02:54,320
Yeah, it's either Hatsune Miku or the default skin.

1209
02:02:54,800 --> 02:02:55,940
Then we won't shoot you.

1210
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:00,560
And then do...

1211
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:04,960
And then do the default dance at us too.

1212
02:03:05,140 --> 02:03:05,860
You got an emote.

1213
02:03:06,400 --> 02:03:07,040
Do I have it?

1214
02:03:07,160 --> 02:03:07,980

1215
02:03:07,980 --> 02:03:08,720
What was it?

1216
02:03:08,800 --> 02:03:09,580
I think I have it.

1217
02:03:09,640 --> 02:03:10,420
I feel like I have it.

1218
02:03:10,560 --> 02:03:11,380
Everybody has it.

1219
02:03:11,480 --> 02:03:12,640
It is a default hero.

1220
02:03:15,760 --> 02:03:18,180
What even is the emote button?

1221
02:03:18,320 --> 02:03:19,000
I don't know what it is.

1222
02:03:19,180 --> 02:03:19,580

1223
02:03:20,940 --> 02:03:21,140

1224
02:03:21,660 --> 02:03:21,880
B.

1225
02:03:31,840 --> 02:03:33,920
Oh my god, it's Power Rangers.

1226
02:03:37,560 --> 02:03:39,060

Also, the sound team, I upped the volume of the game again.

1229
02:04:17,200 --> 02:04:23,560
It took me like 20 minutes to realize it, but it's a lot of audio adjustments.

1230
02:04:24,400 --> 02:04:26,780
Yeah, because I don't pay attention sometimes.

1231
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:28,360
Honestly, fair.

1232
02:04:31,620 --> 02:04:34,960

Weapon?

I got a shotgun.

1240
02:04:48,840 --> 02:04:51,820

I got too sad.

1288
02:08:59,610 --> 02:09:00,430
It was so depressing.

1289
02:09:00,610 --> 02:09:03,330
The first episode is like, it is very sad.

1290
02:09:03,510 --> 02:09:03,590
Yeah.

02:09:03,810 --> 02:09:06,170

02:09:22,010 --> 02:09:23,170
And I was like, don't say that.

1297
02:09:24,070 --> 02:09:24,310
I'm sorry.

1298
02:09:24,550 --> 02:09:24,910
I'm sorry.

1299
02:09:25,090 --> 02:09:25,630
I doubted you, Jacob.

1300
02:09:25,930 --> 02:09:26,050
It was so real.

1301
02:09:26,210 --> 02:09:27,230
I knew he was real.

1302
02:09:27,770 --> 02:09:30,050
I knew Jacob was real all along.

1303
02:09:33,910 --> 02:09:36,010
He got sad because of poverty.

1304
02:09:36,230 --> 02:09:36,990
Yes, of course.

1305
02:09:37,190 --> 02:09:39,570
Anyone would be sad because of that.

1306
02:09:40,410 --> 02:09:40,910
Oh my god.

1307
02:09:41,210 --> 02:09:44,550
Around the world, around the world.

1308
02:09:46,010 --> 02:09:48,990
Yeah, I think these are our fans because there's three, your Hatsune.

1309
02:09:49,130 --> 02:09:50,250
There's four Hatsune Miku.

1310
02:09:50,450 --> 02:09:51,690
Yeah, it's a little bit suspicious.

1311
02:09:52,170 --> 02:09:52,930
I feel like that's a little suspicious.

1312
02:09:53,630 --> 02:09:56,730
The Miku to regular person ratio is a little bit skew.

1313
02:09:57,030 --> 02:09:58,190
Yeah, I feel...

1314
02:09:58,190 --> 02:10:02,490
Guys, join in with Hatsune Miku or Dap.

1315
02:10:02,690 --> 02:10:03,370
Wait, there's...

1316
02:10:03,370 --> 02:10:05,070
Oh, yeah, I forgot they did a Scooby-Doo collab.

1317
02:10:05,230 --> 02:10:05,490
Look at that.

1318
02:10:05,610 --> 02:10:07,630
They made Scooby, like, a real person.

1319
02:10:09,690 --> 02:10:10,490
Round no...

1320
02:10:10,490 --> 02:10:11,730
Look, look.

1321
02:10:11,850 --> 02:10:12,490
Look at Scooby.

1322
02:10:12,490 --> 02:10:13,230
Oh, my God, you're right.

1323
02:10:13,370 --> 02:10:14,150
One of the world.

1324
02:10:14,330 --> 02:10:15,130
Yeah, look at him.

1325
02:10:15,430 --> 02:10:15,830
Also...

1326
02:10:15,830 --> 02:10:17,070

Do you know that video?

1330
02:11:31,610 --> 02:11:35,250
But like, you know that video?

1331
02:11:35,530 --> 02:11:36,670
Okay, so fuck that video.

1332
02:11:36,910 --> 02:11:42,090
But he's like, Marge, I don't want to run your only bad.

1333
02:11:42,450 --> 02:11:43,690
Do you know that video?

1334
02:11:45,150 --> 02:11:48,030
So when do the games actually stop?

1335
02:11:49,630 --> 02:11:51,270
Oh, I'll take, guess that's it.

1336
02:11:51,990 --> 02:11:52,890
Okay, there we go.

1337
02:11:52,950 --> 02:11:54,130
All right, it's the usual.

1338
02:11:54,530 --> 02:11:54,730
Okay.

1339
02:11:59,950 --> 02:12:00,950
understand how this works.

1340
02:12:04,450 --> 02:12:05,350
Excuse me.

1341
02:12:06,110 --> 02:12:06,550
Oh, God.

1342
02:12:06,870 --> 02:12:08,510
The jump scare was so close.

1343
02:12:13,550 --> 02:12:14,810
We got this.

1344
02:12:16,170 --> 02:12:17,190
It's just the typical.

1345
02:12:17,210 --> 02:12:18,070
I saw this episode.

1346
02:12:18,410 --> 02:12:18,430
Yeah.

1347
02:12:18,890 --> 02:12:29,590
I've seen this clip on Fortnite where someone would like play the, um, they do put voice chat on and they'll play like red light green light thing and it would fuck with people.

1348
02:12:30,490 --> 02:12:31,450
Oh, God.

1349
02:12:33,970 --> 02:12:36,710
Because you can use voice chat and just, like, play the recording.

1350
02:12:37,890 --> 02:12:38,190
Oh, my God.

1351
02:12:38,310 --> 02:12:39,930
I hear people dying around me.

1352
02:12:44,790 --> 02:12:45,070
Okay.

1353
02:12:45,410 --> 02:12:47,550
That Scooby totally should have...

1354
02:12:47,550 --> 02:12:48,530
Yeah, I know.

1355
02:12:48,630 --> 02:12:49,410
I saw that.

1356
02:12:51,810 --> 02:12:52,330
Whoa.

1357
02:12:53,870 --> 02:12:55,050
You can emote.

1358
02:12:55,590 --> 02:12:56,330
Oh, my God.

1359
02:12:56,410 --> 02:12:57,190
This is not fair.

1360
02:12:57,350 --> 02:12:58,250
This is not fair.

1361
02:13:01,090 --> 02:13:02,190
Oh my god.

1362
02:13:02,270 --> 02:13:04,190
Oh my god.

1363
02:13:11,070 --> 02:13:12,250
I'm so scared.

1364
02:13:12,690 --> 02:13:14,270
I'm so scared right now.

1365
02:13:14,790 --> 02:13:15,270
We do.

1366
02:13:15,530 --> 02:13:16,050
Oh my god.

1367
02:13:16,270 --> 02:13:18,190
So many people are dying.

1368
02:13:19,350 --> 02:13:19,930
Please.

1369
02:13:23,950 --> 02:13:24,610
We're almost there.

1370
02:13:32,020 --> 02:13:32,760
Oh my god.

1371
02:13:33,020 --> 02:13:33,340
How did she?

1372
02:13:33,540 --> 02:13:34,280
How did he die?

1373
02:13:35,480 --> 02:13:36,200
You're like.

1374
02:13:37,320 --> 02:13:38,560
We did it.

1375
02:13:39,340 --> 02:13:39,920
Yeah.

1376
02:13:44,520 --> 02:13:45,320
That's right.

1377
02:13:46,760 --> 02:13:47,160
Wee!

1378
02:13:48,380 --> 02:13:49,340
Oh my god, I'm stupid!

1379
02:13:49,340 --> 02:13:51,260
Bark hitting the Miku Miku beam is my...

1380
02:13:51,260 --> 02:13:52,800
Oh wait, hold on, I gotta join in on this.

1381
02:13:54,160 --> 02:13:55,620
Stupid sexy planners.

1382
02:13:58,260 --> 02:14:00,560
Oh my god, he's gonna take us out of the boundary.

1383
02:14:00,740 --> 02:14:01,700
We're all gonna die.

1384
02:14:02,860 --> 02:14:04,420
You see the stormtrooper?

1385
02:14:05,080 --> 02:14:06,540
He's just riding it.

1386
02:14:08,740 --> 02:14:09,140
Oh!

1387
02:14:11,160 --> 02:14:13,640
Oh, apparently you don't make it and you ascend back to the...

1388
02:14:13,640 --> 02:14:14,240
Oh, goodbye.

1389
02:14:14,460 --> 02:14:16,120
You ascend back to the beginning.

1390
02:14:16,900 --> 02:14:18,060
So you have to do it again.

1391
02:14:18,380 --> 02:14:19,480
But that guy is drifting.

1392
02:14:19,660 --> 02:14:22,560
This stormtrooper just drifted into the goal.

1393
02:14:22,760 --> 02:14:23,860
And I love that.

1394
02:14:27,060 --> 02:14:32,060
Oh, so much about this game has changed.

1395
02:14:32,180 --> 02:14:33,540
I feel like I understand nothing.

1396
02:14:34,740 --> 02:14:35,580
You said understand.

1397
02:14:35,840 --> 02:14:39,200
I think that was just like the game like a year ago too.

1398
02:14:40,080 --> 02:14:41,100
You still don't understand.

1399
02:14:41,160 --> 02:14:45,380
Is this how people hang out these days in Fortnite lobbies?

1400
02:14:47,180 --> 02:14:48,280
You just mess around.

1401
02:14:48,560 --> 02:14:49,480
We'll never understand.

1402
02:14:50,360 --> 02:14:52,480
No, I'm starting to get up there.

1403
02:14:52,620 --> 02:14:55,160
I'm starting to understand that I'm just like, man, I don't get this.

1404
02:14:55,240 --> 02:14:59,920
Is this what it was like when I was young, including Arby and the chief at people?

1405
02:15:00,040 --> 02:15:00,740
No, it's the kids.

1406
02:15:00,740 --> 02:15:01,360
People thought I was weird.

1407
02:15:01,580 --> 02:15:02,320
It's the kids.

1408
02:15:02,580 --> 02:15:03,600
You've always been hit.

1409
02:15:03,740 --> 02:15:04,600
Remember that.

1410
02:15:05,240 --> 02:15:06,640
It's the kids fault.

1411
02:15:07,240 --> 02:15:07,620
Wait, who?

1412
02:15:07,900 --> 02:15:08,180
All right.

1413
02:15:08,280 --> 02:15:08,940
Does anyone?

1414
02:15:09,280 --> 02:15:10,580
It is the children who are wrong.

1415
02:15:11,160 --> 02:15:12,220
All right, everyone.

1416
02:15:12,720 --> 02:15:16,560
Is there anyone in our lobby with...

1417
02:15:16,560 --> 02:15:17,980
Oh, wait, we have to go to the next area.

1418
02:15:18,880 --> 02:15:19,660
Oh, wait, what?

1419
02:15:21,080 --> 02:15:22,400
Oh, it just keeps going.

1420
02:15:22,840 --> 02:15:25,720
It's this thing.

1421
02:15:28,340 --> 02:15:29,040
Excuse me.

1422
02:15:29,180 --> 02:15:29,960
What is that?

1423
02:15:30,140 --> 02:15:31,560
Where in the world is the...

1424
02:15:31,560 --> 02:15:33,020
Oh, we have to check in.

1425
02:15:33,700 --> 02:15:36,400
Remember when they do their little face recognition thing?

1426
02:15:38,820 --> 02:15:40,920
Okay, guys, one at a time.

1427
02:15:41,160 --> 02:15:42,880
Come on, let me through.

1428
02:15:43,540 --> 02:15:44,580
Let me fucking through.

1429
02:15:44,800 --> 02:15:46,520
Okay, oh, oh, I'm taking my picture.

1430
02:15:55,620 --> 02:16:04,240
I am a little worried because I don't know if we'll die if we don't make it.

1431
02:16:07,160 --> 02:16:07,680
I'm...

1432
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:09,200
Oh, wait, where am I?

1433
02:16:09,660 --> 02:16:10,560
Oh, we made it.

1434
02:16:10,560 --> 02:16:13,640
And we're- no worry, we're just- we're just with the squad over here.

1435
02:16:13,680 --> 02:16:14,760
Yeah, we're with the squad.

1436
02:16:15,080 --> 02:16:16,320
Look at that, we the winner.

1437
02:16:16,560 --> 02:16:18,060
And everybody is joining in.

1438
02:16:21,040 --> 02:16:23,140
We the winners here!

1439
02:16:23,500 --> 02:16:25,980
This is the dumbest thing I've seen in a long time.

1440
02:16:26,040 --> 02:16:27,960
We made it, everyone!

1441
02:16:28,580 --> 02:16:29,780
Let us go!

1442
02:16:31,100 --> 02:16:32,740
Join in, everyone!

1445
02:16:37,700 --> 02:16:38,720
Oh, what is this?

02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:40,020

Guys, please, personal space.

1451
02:17:19,740 --> 02:17:22,420
I don't like everyone crowding me right now.

1452
02:17:23,680 --> 02:17:26,040
I'm trying to speedrun this for some reason.

1453
02:17:26,180 --> 02:17:27,060
I really shouldn't.

1454
02:17:27,580 --> 02:17:28,960
I should just be taking my time.

1455
02:17:34,060 --> 02:17:34,500
Oh, wait.

Oh, my God.

You can hit your...

02:17:40,530 --> 02:17:41,230
Okay, I can get hit.

1460
02:17:41,750 --> 02:17:42,190

1464
02:19:17,150 --> 02:19:23,650
Yeah, yeah, there's socially agreed upon rules where you're supposed to let the survivors run around a little bit before you kill them.

1465
02:19:23,870 --> 02:19:29,950
Because if you kill them too soon, the survivors will get mad and they'll report you and fucking leave the game.

1466
02:19:31,970 --> 02:19:34,110
Even though that's not the official game mode?

1467
02:19:34,250 --> 02:19:35,190
Yeah, yeah, no, it's...

1468
02:19:35,190 --> 02:19:44,090
And at one point, at one point, the devs made it so that people would get penalized if you kill the survivors too early.

1469
02:19:44,450 --> 02:20:48,150
and they removed it but it was fucking crazy you could actually get like lose points for for trying to win the game yeah imagine that just logging in not knowing anything about the social state of dead by daylight and just like okay i'm gonna play to the best of my ability why am i banned yeah all right yeah you're like you're supposed to let them play the game a little bit all right we gotta work together this is where i died last time in the world this is this is the best this the best part of the season two and this is where i died last time because nobody wanted to work together so what do you do so it's gonna go around it'll be like go around and then you're gonna be like you see these rooms and they'll be like you have they'll be like three people in that room and you can apparently kill if there's too many people in the room you can apparently kill that person and that's what happened to me i got ganged up on and got beat up in the in the corner I'm scared I'm scared we gotta

1470
02:20:48,150 --> 02:20:58,710

All I'm saying was there were two of us.

02:24:16,080 --> 02:24:18,120
There were two other people in that room.

1505
02:24:18,480 --> 02:24:20,860
And they could have locked that door.

1506
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,740
They could have also locked that door.

1507
02:24:28,620 --> 02:24:54,100

like in a way fortnite ended up becoming a little bit like roblox yeah no it's literally roblox it is roblox it's roblox but with ips with like actual ips what the is this i don't know this seems like this seems creepy yeah i know the last game last game is crazy that you mean that one wasn't the last no this was the it was the dinner before the oh it's the dinner before last game so last game is basically they gotta push each other off the off these platforms and stuff and the one person that survives obviously wins so yeah they gotta push each other off the platform okay so it's just king of the hill basically yeah and then it was so fucked up because like it was like copyright IPs versus like non-copyright IPs and I was like band together guys and push off that defog skin And they didn't have to fight in each other.

1612
02:34:38,970 --> 02:34:40,230
I was like, are you stupid?

1613
02:34:42,510 --> 02:34:44,790
You let an original IP.

1614
02:34:44,790 --> 02:34:45,990
This is about making money.

1615
02:34:46,390 --> 02:34:48,030
And they didn't spend any.

1616
02:34:48,110 --> 02:34:52,410
I was like, how dare you let the non-skin buyer win?

1617
02:34:53,050 --> 02:34:53,710
Good luck.

1618
02:34:54,670 --> 02:34:55,650
What's that saying?

1619
02:34:55,730 --> 02:34:56,870
Skins get wins?

1620
02:34:57,150 --> 02:35:00,310
That's what you used to say back in the league days.

1621
02:35:02,470 --> 02:35:04,110
Get Miku out first.

1622
02:35:05,410 --> 02:35:06,470
I believe in her.

1623
02:35:07,410 --> 02:35:39,130
strong i have faith guys oh that was cool scooby this is like that mario party thing where you got to knock them off with giant snow boulders oh my god they're like trying to bait each other too you saw a stormtrooper you tried to yeah yeah they're trying to mind game it yeah he's like oh guys i'm oh silly me i'm just afk right now Guys,

1624
02:35:39,370 --> 02:35:44,610
there's three of you and one Miku with the power of threes.

1625
02:35:44,930 --> 02:35:46,090
She's playing defense.

1626
02:35:47,730 --> 02:35:49,170
Bro, come on, guys.

1627
02:35:49,450 --> 02:35:51,590
Not that hard is push someone off a cliff.

1628
02:35:52,870 --> 02:35:54,250
I'm not speaking from experience, by the way.

1629
02:35:54,250 --> 02:35:56,610
You see, what this means is that for the platform to start shrinking.

1630
02:35:56,810 --> 02:35:57,170
Oh, it will.

1631
02:35:57,410 --> 02:35:57,770
Don't worry.

1632
02:35:57,970 --> 02:35:58,150
It will.

1633
02:35:58,250 --> 02:35:59,350
It takes like a bit of time.

1634
02:35:59,470 --> 02:36:00,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1635
02:36:01,250 --> 02:36:01,930
Oh my god.

1636
02:36:01,970 --> 02:36:03,770
Okay, I thought the stormtrooper is gonna die.

1637
02:36:05,370 --> 02:36:06,110
I'm watching her.

1638
02:36:06,150 --> 02:36:07,470
It's a very generous platform.

1639
02:36:07,830 --> 02:36:08,370
Yeah, yeah.

1640
02:36:08,370 --> 02:36:14,130
Yeah, they're like, um, it gets a lot worse, obviously, the further they go.

1641
02:36:14,450 --> 02:36:15,070
Come on, guys.

1642
02:36:15,570 --> 02:36:16,110
Come on.

1643
02:36:16,390 --> 02:36:20,570
I'm loving that the Scooby just wrapped his tail around the pole there.

1644
02:36:22,870 --> 02:36:23,490
Oh, shoot.

1645
02:36:23,730 --> 02:36:25,150
Yeah, they have to go to the next one.

1646
02:36:25,530 --> 02:36:27,330
And then by the last one, it shrinks.

1647
02:36:27,410 --> 02:36:28,070
It starts shrinking.

1648
02:36:28,330 --> 02:36:30,070
So, like, this is a smaller platform now.

1649
02:36:32,090 --> 02:36:33,130
All right, let's see what happens.

1650
02:36:37,890 --> 02:36:38,850
They're just...

1651
02:36:40,870 --> 02:36:42,510
They're not fighting anymore.

1652
02:36:43,210 --> 02:36:45,290
Like, peace and love, everyone.

1653
02:36:45,630 --> 02:36:46,850
Peace and love.

1654
02:36:50,970 --> 02:36:56,130
And then there's just, like, sounds of, like, stepping of everybody's.

1655
02:36:59,750 --> 02:37:01,930
Peace and love, everyone.

1656
02:37:06,460 --> 02:37:06,860
Oh.

1657
02:37:07,240 --> 02:37:08,420
Oh, my God.

1658
02:37:08,500 --> 02:37:08,860
Hey, guys.

1659
02:37:08,940 --> 02:37:12,460
I don't know if you know this, but if you push them upwards, they go further.

1660
02:37:12,680 --> 02:37:13,140
Yeah, guys.

1661
02:37:13,240 --> 02:37:14,080
Push up, guys.

1662
02:37:14,100 --> 02:38:05,600
guys just look up and then start pushing they'll never know oh did one of them fall no no no they didn't wait let's just wait scooby's a double agent fucking push him off how is he a double agent he's trying to protect miku i see him you fucker push him off he doesn't deserve it i knew i knew i could count raptor boss 84 that's it i'm looking for you in my chat you must be named the same thing like i would be very surprised if he was very committed to like no raptor boss that's me yeah that's my username raptor boss 84 wait spider-man's did they killed spider-man yeah they killed spider-man how could you do that he was too punk rock truly

1663
02:38:09,420 --> 02:38:41,360
I didn't know the Miku's name so I can ban her when she wins It's an OGP dark bone OGP I know your name now Oh wait wait wait Oh Okay Scooby versus Miku No I know Scooby's a coward Scooby's a oh no they're colluding He's a coward He's gonna do it for a Scooby snack It's so over Like was what was it gonna be He was gonna do it for Scooby's now.

1664
02:38:41,380 --> 02:38:43,080
Oh, she did it for a leak!

1665
02:38:45,320 --> 02:38:46,500
Miku, what?

1666
02:38:47,780 --> 02:38:49,340
Oh, yeah, she gets...

1667
02:38:49,340 --> 02:38:51,160
The world is hers, after all.

1668
02:38:52,060 --> 02:38:54,100
She's gonna do a Miku-Miku beam.

1669
02:38:56,100 --> 02:38:57,240
World is mine.

1670
02:38:58,200 --> 02:38:59,360
I'm listening to the music.

1671
02:38:59,660 --> 02:39:01,080
It's so dramatic.

1672
02:39:01,160 --> 02:39:02,000
I know it is.

1673
02:39:02,080 --> 02:39:02,900
It's like, you could take...

1674
02:39:02,900 --> 02:39:04,220
Hey, I remember this from the show.

1675
02:39:04,560 --> 02:39:04,960
Yeah!

1676
02:39:07,500 --> 02:39:08,640
Oh, my God, it's so dramatic.

1677
02:39:12,600 --> 02:39:19,340
right oh you get your own mask you could be part of the team or you get to choose

1678
02:39:24,600 --> 02:40:38,290
oh what did she choose what is that is that the money i don't know what did you choose i don't even know what that option is everything is so mysterious yeah i guess we'll only know if what the fuck we're in the world oh we see this where is she in the void yeah i was gonna say where is she okay echo echo echo echo she chose she chose wrong she she she won the squid games and got to pick her prize and then just like banished to the shadow realm you picked wrong miku you should have joined the team holy that was fun i told you i told i told you i was going to bring you to another gate i put bring you to another game mode all right let's leave all right how do i get it i know i don't know okay escape okay return to lobby return to lobby it's at the very bottom there we go okay i think i actually might have to hop off it's Starting to get like 5 a.m.

1679
02:40:38,310 --> 02:40:38,470
here.

1680
02:40:38,690 --> 02:40:41,270
Yeah, you were like, I heard that, yeah, okay, how was my experience?

1681
02:40:41,350 --> 02:40:42,450
Not fun at all.

1682
02:40:44,550 --> 02:40:45,530
I don't know.

1683
02:40:45,930 --> 02:40:48,510
We got to mess around with bots a little bit.

1684
02:40:48,750 --> 02:40:52,430
It just happened that the humans started coming in and making it difficult.

1685
02:40:53,990 --> 02:40:55,870
They're like, how do you rate the experience?

1686
02:40:56,310 --> 02:40:56,610
One.

1687
02:40:58,250 --> 02:40:58,690
One.

1688
02:40:59,050 --> 02:41:02,430
I also got one of those like, one, because I didn't win.

1689
02:41:02,890 --> 02:41:03,330
Exactly.

1690
02:41:03,730 --> 02:41:05,890
If I don't win, it's a one.

1691
02:41:07,950 --> 02:42:03,810
I feel like that's a pretty pretty understandable metric of success that most people have yep yep exactly you know what's up but that was fun that was so fun Zandu it was really nice just hanging out again you know like for sure we were like debating like I said we were debating on what to do at first we're like what if I just play a sonic game and then you're just I was just like oh i don't know if you want to open that pandora's box i will not shut up yeah and also like i realized sonic games take a while to complete as well so the one you talked about especially that one takes a while yeah so maybe in the future so we're like what the fuck do we do oh yeah someone was asking if we would if we would come back to dead space three we'll let you guys know right now i we i can't believe i remember when the first time we started Dead Space 3,

1692
02:42:04,310 --> 02:42:06,550
I was like, I never finished Dead Space 3.

1693
02:42:06,810 --> 02:42:11,090
Like, it's every time I try to finish it with someone, it just never, it stops.

1694
02:42:12,790 --> 02:42:20,050
So, we have to let you guys, we have to let you guys know that neither of us have the save files.

1695
02:42:21,350 --> 02:42:23,850
Where are we stopped at?

1696
02:42:23,990 --> 02:42:25,930
It's in a vault at EA somewhere.

1697
02:42:26,330 --> 02:42:27,990
It's gone forever.

1698
02:42:28,330 --> 02:42:32,290
Well, technically not forever, but, like, we don't have the save files.

1699
02:42:32,310 --> 02:42:37,630
So we were like, do we really want to replay it from the beginning?

1700
02:42:37,990 --> 02:42:40,150
Like, how close to the end were we?

1701
02:42:40,270 --> 02:42:42,050
We were like one part away.

1702
02:42:42,350 --> 02:42:44,790
That's the sad, like one to two parts away.

1703
02:42:45,110 --> 02:42:46,530
That's the sad part.

1704
02:42:46,970 --> 02:42:48,950
That's the saddest part.

1705
02:42:49,350 --> 02:42:53,710
I don't, I don't know if it was just me, it didn't feel like it.

1706
02:42:53,770 --> 02:42:56,850
I felt like we had like half the game left to go.

1707
02:42:57,350 --> 02:43:01,950
We were like, do we really want to play pack from the beginning?

1708
02:43:02,310 --> 02:44:04,510
like all the way back from the beginning to go through that that was like dead space three it had its moments you know i i like i like going crazy that part was oh yeah the the part where you were seeing things yeah you're like do you see that and i was like what i just see a boss yes you're like there's a body there and i'm like how's the how's the remake i've only ever played the first dead space is the remake anything the remake is so good it's actually really it's a lot scary i think it's personally a lot scarier than the original they like change a lot of they change a lot of things too that's cool that's cool i like yeah because the first one is the only one that i really played and then there was the second one where they made him talk and i was i was such a like child about it i was like they what do you mean he's talking that's not scary i don't care yeah you're like how dare you make it have give him a personality how would i self-insert myself as isaac now yeah but it's like

1709
02:44:04,510 --> 02:44:34,590
that's what makes horror games scary to me when i feel like it's happening to me like even if i know that his name is isaac if he doesn't speak i could be isaac yeah it could be i like it could be isaac zandu clark you know that could be near his yeah it's just literally his little middle name yeah you don't know they never specified one this mask in the second game and you're like now i can't self-insert myself i thought he could have been a woman in there my immersion is broken yeah my immersion's gone it's over

1710
02:44:38,170 --> 02:44:57,090
like how dare you have a personality that's disgusting is he still at least he'll be quiet in the remake right and didn't give him i don't remember honestly i just remember it was like very fucking scary that's all i remember he's quiet that's all i care about i'm feddy like that I just want him to be quiet.

1711
02:44:57,650 --> 02:44:58,370
Yeah, exactly.

1712
02:44:59,510 --> 02:45:01,310
But I had a fun time.

1713
02:45:01,450 --> 02:45:03,550
It was nice, you know, just hanging out.

1714
02:45:04,470 --> 02:45:07,030
It was like opening a fun little box of memories.

1715
02:45:07,650 --> 02:45:10,490
Yeah, and it's like, now it's like, what time is it already?

1716
02:45:11,670 --> 02:45:14,030
It's on closing in on 5 a.m.

1717
02:45:14,030 --> 02:45:18,270
But luckily my dad works night shift, so there's nobody in the house except me and the dog.

1718
02:45:18,470 --> 02:45:18,910
Yay.

1719
02:45:20,730 --> 02:45:21,690
That's good.

1720
02:45:21,970 --> 02:45:22,450
That's good.

1721
02:45:22,530 --> 02:45:24,030
You don't get noise complaints like me.

1722
02:45:24,030 --> 02:45:41,030
I I have new neighbors that's the thing like like we like my dad does have neighbors Yeah like they have never like like I grew up here So they never once complained about any of the noise that I made so The walls must be thick bro.

1723
02:45:41,290 --> 02:45:41,590
Oh my god.

1724
02:45:41,650 --> 02:46:51,090
I must be so nice I recently I think I recently got new neighbors and like at first I got a noise complaint at 10 30 in the morning because of my Yeah, I know that is under reason people are awake at that like mad about noise was barking and i was just like oh i'm sorry and i lied and said i was sleeping but i was asleep but i wasn't oh my god because they're like i see because like i trying to i tell this in my chat but i'm trying to like not give in you know because then it reinforces his behavior so like i try them tire out but he's a obviously he's a weiner dog and they're the second loudest like they have the second loudest dog bark and out of all the breeds so it's very loud so oh no so yeah so and then like today i got another noise complaint today at five in the morning which is more justifiable okay that's valid yeah that's valid um i didn't confront them like they tried to confront me and i didn't answer the door because to be fair i was also in game so i was like i got yeah

1725
02:46:51,090 --> 02:47:23,450
and make sure i don't lose my there's a knock on the door but but literally while streaming i was like guys i can't lose my rank points guys i gotta keep also like i was just like all right i was just like okay guys i'll just be a little quiet because i also don't really want it i don't want to deal with that i think they'd be very angry if i opened my door yeah if it means anything i've I ever got in my apartment was when,

1726
02:47:23,750 --> 02:47:25,570
oh excuse me, I have hiccups.

1727
02:47:25,830 --> 02:47:25,970
Whoa.

1728
02:47:26,110 --> 02:47:29,010
That was when I was, I was too loud at 5 a.m.

1729
02:47:29,030 --> 02:47:29,570
in my neighbor.

1730
02:47:29,770 --> 02:47:34,710
That's the only time I've ever like had like a direct interaction with him when he like told me off.

1731
02:47:34,890 --> 02:47:37,610
And to, to his credit, I was being way too freaking loud at 5 a.m.

1732
02:47:37,990 --> 02:47:38,270
Yeah.

1733
02:47:38,270 --> 02:47:42,490
But then he's just been a jerk ever since and like, it's not like he is a saint either.

1734
02:47:42,690 --> 02:47:46,490
Like he drills and makes construction noises at like 2.

1735
02:47:46,590 --> 02:47:47,650
Fuck that shit.

1736
02:47:48,210 --> 02:47:48,550
Yeah.

1737
02:47:49,050 --> 02:47:49,550
Fuck that.

1738
02:47:50,290 --> 02:47:55,970
I'm like, if you're going to make noise complaints, then you're fucking hypocrite, if you do the same thing.

1739
02:47:56,050 --> 02:47:57,750
I tour in the morning, you know?

1740
02:47:57,910 --> 02:47:59,350
I feel like drills are worse.

1741
02:48:00,110 --> 02:48:01,790
Drills are worse than like...

1742
02:48:01,790 --> 02:48:02,490
Just...

1743
02:48:02,930 --> 02:48:03,870
Yeah, because...

1744
02:48:03,870 --> 02:48:04,430
Oh, God, my hiccups.

1745
02:48:04,490 --> 02:48:05,550
Why did I get hiccups now?

1746
02:48:05,570 --> 02:48:07,870
It doesn't even sound appealing and stuff, too.

1747
02:48:07,930 --> 02:48:08,990
That's the worst part.

1748
02:48:10,130 --> 02:48:10,530
Exactly.

1749
02:48:10,810 --> 02:48:11,570
It's just...

1750
02:48:11,570 --> 02:48:12,050
Yeah.

1751
02:48:12,230 --> 02:48:15,290
It's what my thoughts sound like when I'm in a bad mood.

1752
02:48:15,830 --> 02:48:17,070
Yeah, he's like...

1753
02:48:18,830 --> 02:48:20,270
And then the hammering.

1754
02:48:20,290 --> 02:49:17,850
on the wall too no I had that too yeah and you then you always hear that after too like they yeah that's so annoying no I actually had that in the morning too I think it's the same neighbors I don't know because it's like so close to me and I was just like what the fuck is going on but I didn't complain I I didn't complain about it I let it happen that's the same I've never complained directly to his face because I just understand that hey if you live in an apartment complex there's gonna be noises yeah yeah of course well not like I will admit not my noises though because like who would like you know like what were the chances of you living next to a streamer uh you're just hearing screaming blood murder is free yeah yeah also like that's dude because they'll be like what are you doing and i'll be like what can i say like i don't want to be like almost streamer and that's why i had my boot within my apartment that's right my chow is telling me to buy like those sound booth things but

1755
02:49:17,850 --> 02:49:27,050
like the thing is because I remember you telling me how fucking hot it is inside those things, but it's already really hot in my like PC room.

1756
02:49:27,410 --> 02:49:30,810
So if I buy the sound booth, I think I might like die of heat stroke.

1757
02:49:31,070 --> 02:49:31,470
You might cook yourself.

1758
02:49:31,790 --> 02:49:33,990
Yeah, I might actually cook myself as well.

1759
02:49:34,190 --> 02:49:34,950
Like I'm actually cooked.

1760
02:49:35,390 --> 02:49:41,730
So like, so I'm planning on, because you know, you saw like, because you're like, oh, just soundproof your room.

1761
02:49:42,170 --> 02:49:43,970
And I was like, oh, I should hire someone for that.

1762
02:49:44,030 --> 02:49:44,990
And you're like, you can do it yourself.

1763
02:49:45,310 --> 02:49:48,990
I was like, do you not see my DIY project of my VR stuff?

1764
02:49:49,230 --> 02:50:57,270
we should not i should not be handling soundproofing and the thing is you know like the tapes and stuff that i did for my room and stuff for the vr stuff it took me two to three hours so like to put that up you don't understand you don't you don't understand there was a lot of trial there was yeah there was a lot of trial and error it was a lot i i kept you know how i told you i kept thinking it'll if i keep putting more tape that's why there's a lot of tape if i kept putting more tape and I kept sticking on it eventually it will work so I did like three to four times before I realized maybe I should stop using the audio film and try something else something intended to be used as adhesive perhaps yeah so there was a lot of trial and error to get this to work and also coming up with the idea also took a while too so uh so how's the paint behind the if you don't mind me asking i don't want to think about that oh that side told me so much that side told me so no okay wait okay so i

1765
02:50:57,270 --> 02:51:47,930
