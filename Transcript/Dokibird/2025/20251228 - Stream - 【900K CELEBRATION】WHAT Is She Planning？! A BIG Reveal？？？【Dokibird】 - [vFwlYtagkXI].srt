1
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,340
Thank you.

2
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,060
Thank you.

3
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:57,080
well i can't

4
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:51,300
just say it's the universe we don't want like english too
order order welcome jokies to 808 jokie verse council

5
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,620
meeting committee is now in session business.

6
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:02,000
As you know, we have received complaints from the other
Doki's that we do not have enough representation on the

7
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,320
board.

8
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:09,280
Ever since more and more Doki members have joined the DBA,
as you guys all know, the Doki Bird Association, we have to

9
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,400
nominate new delegates to represent our fellow Doki's.

10
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:20,660
But before we begin, let's do a roll call because last time
we didn't do a roll call and And then we didn't get enough

11
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,160
votes to pass our agenda.

12
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,220
So, first one on the list.

13
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,060
Grokey.

14
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,380
All right.

15
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:28,860
Doki bug.

16
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,380
Cha.

17
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:30,420
Mm-hmm.

18
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,960
Retro Doki.

19
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,940
Lay it again.

20
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,520
Present, present.

21
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,180
Oh,

22
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,290
he's five minutes from the fucking boardroom.

23
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,670
You can literally just attend the meeting in person.

24
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,590
Hey, who talked to me like that?

25
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:55,590
I used to be Doki.

26
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,880
Not even the original Doki Prime.

27
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:05,820
Yeah, but she's.

28
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,840
dead now.

29
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,160
So that makes me

30
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:14,870
Decorum dokeys.

31
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:15,610
Decorum!

32
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:22,010
Now, my fellow dokeys, we all know that without me, none of
you would exist.

33
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,290
So remember the mantra, guys.

34
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,710
And every dokey is a tomato.

35
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,770
They say tomato.

36
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,290
Tomato dokey is right.

37
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:34,450
At this moment, we need to deal with the current issues on
hand.

38
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,650
Yeah, if you knew it right.

39
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:40,970
And, as you all know, we have chosen representatives of all
different kinds of dokeys in the dokey.

40
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:45,990
first, but yet we still lack one important doki, a chibi
doki.

41
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:52,770
Tokis are talking.

42
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,050
Okay, who brought their chibi to the meeting today?

43
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,910
You know we can't bring outsiders?

44
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,370
Ah, sorry.

45
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,830
That's me.

46
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:06,910
I have custody of her today, and you know, her mom said I
don't pick her up.

47
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,530
I have to show up to her birthday.

48
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,950
No, we don't really do that.

49
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,410
You know us Doki's.

50
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,610
Okay, okay.

51
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:18,130
But if this happens again, just drop her off at Club Doki.

52
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,110
That's down the street.

53
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,630
They have a babysitting program there.

54
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,270
And they accept Chibi's as well, I think.

55
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,270
I'm pretty sure, right?

56
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,750
Hey!

57
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:57,350
Okay, for now, you can put her outside the door and put in a
box or something.

58
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,410
She can entertain herself for hours in there.

59
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:00,610
I've tried it with my TV.

60
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,050
Oh, anyway, back to my point.

61
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:11,110
The other jokies have started to accuse us of being chibis
because of our lack of representation.

62
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:12,650
And we can't have that again.

63
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,630
Not again, okay, guys?

64
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:20,350
Yep, we might hate mutants and raccoons, but we are not
chibis.

65
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:23,250
So, starting today, we have gathered a bunch of chibis.

66
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:28,530
Doki's, who applied for an interview to become the newest
board member of the Doki Council.

67
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:33,490
After the interviews, we will then have a vote with a board
on who was set at the table, you know, the usual stuff.

68
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,350
Yes, Doki, what is it?

69
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,510
Come on, Doki's.

70
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,810
Why don't we make it a little bit more exciting?

71
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:43,570
Also, well, I mean, we can get the drag rooms to vote for
the representative.

72
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,950
The first public Doki vote.

73
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,010
I'm looking at Twitter right now.

74
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,850
And look at the odd engagement baiting we can get.

75
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:53,250
We might even get another Hunger Games out of here.

76
00:11:53,270 --> 00:12:00,530
babe you think about it yeah i mean they're still yelling
that the votes were rigged because i got in the board

77
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:07,670
instead of do kitty i'll make the rules there can only be
one cat on the council and what can i say it happened to be

78
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:16,290
the better cat honestly it's not a bad idea dokey all right
all in favor of letting the dragons decide to dokey

79
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:18,850
representative so we don't have to do more work

80
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:26,050
Okay, well, that seems to be everything on the agenda.

81
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:32,530
Um, looking at this, we do have the 3D debut and rest of
Tuber, but we can just table that for next year.

82
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,890
We gotta go home early and do our nap gotcha, right?

83
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,750
Like, it's our scheduled nap gotcha time.

84
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:40,330
We keep pushing into the next meeting, but I don't worry.

85
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,190
I'm pretty sure we'll get to it next meeting for sure this
time.

86
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:44,690
Finally tackle that shit.

87
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:45,730
I believe in us.

88
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:49,030
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right,
Jokies.

89
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,230
Meeting adjourned.

90
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,950
Go back to your Jokieverse.

91
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:24,790
Hello!

92
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:26,610

collar.

Oh, my gosh.

00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:38,610
Sometimes it just doesn't work that way, you know?

100
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:50,490
But welcome, dragons, to the historic DBA Maple Building,
named after one of our first founders, Maple Sea Bird.

Being an intern to the DBA.

114
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:47,950
It would be so fun.

115
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:50,110

00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,410

So we'll know when it ends.

129
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:39,030
When the chibi dokeys stop appearing, we'll know it ended.

130
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,450
That's our guideline.

131
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:41,570
Yeah.

132
00:16:46,650 --> 00:17:01,410

vote your dokey will be suspended from the DBA and you know

Thank you, thank you.

Democracy was immediately broken.

No, no, no.

152

We appreciate your votes here.

153
00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:02,310
Like I said, This is the very first public vote open to the
Dragoons.

154
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:06,210
Every decision in the past was decided by your fellow
Jokies.

155
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:10,070
But for today, we are hosting a very special event.

156
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:13,650
Today, your voice will now matter.

157
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:15,710
I don't know.

158
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:20,790
And, but if you fuck up this vote, it might not matter
later.

159
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,030
Just a little disclaimer.

160
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,130
This is a test.

272
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:32,030

See, I'm very expressive too.

00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,320
Oh, oh, and

282
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:25,770
so if you, if you vote for identity theft is a crime, um,
it's called parody law, um, I wouldn't expect you, Dragoon,

283
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:31,870
to know that, just you specifically, that Dragoon that said
that, all you other dragons, oh my god, my first

284
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:37,410
controversy, oh, don't cancel me, all you other triggers are
cool, you're cool in my book, but that Dragoon, that

285
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:45,010
Dragoon, he implied, he, tried to imply that i'm trying to
steal someone's identity i would never it's called like

286
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:56,970
parody law and it's called inspiration all right inspirate
fair use and in i was inspired by my idol dope kitty and i

287
00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:05,630
felt that she deserved to be on the board okay um and
because you know they don't

288
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:16,910
get on the board you literally get tenors tenure so like you
cannot like they're there forever so dope kitty is never

289
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:28,350
gonna be able to get on the board but if you if you vote for
me we will have a dope kitty on the board just think about

290
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:36,790
that you know just just think about that also all right i

291
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:42,650
Don't you want to vote for me, please?

292
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:44,990
This is all I have.

293
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:49,630
I don't have a job.

294
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:55,070
They play really good bonuses at the boardroom.

295
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:57,990
Please vote for me.

296
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,570
I'm the first one to do it.

297
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:03,870
I have to be first for the interview.

298
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:12,650
So yes, a vote for me.

299
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:15,470
is a vote for Do-Kiri.

300
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:24,410
Also, I realized the intern did not mention this since we
also have like a speaker to your room as well so we could

301
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:26,310
hear what's going on in that room.

302
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:36,410
But they forgot to mention that you will be in charge of
naming, giving us the nicknames because, you know, we all

303
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:39,850
call each other Do-Ki-Bird, you know, like, oh, Do-Ki,
Do-Ki.

304
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:44,350
But like the names that you're more familiar with were given
by you guys.

305
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:51,010
Because, you know, like, for example, Kroki and Do Kitty,
they were like, you know, you guys gave their names.

306
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:55,970
So this is your job to, like, name each one of us, too.

307
00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:03,650
So, you can't name me Do Cheeby because there's multiple
applicants to be...

308
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:06,630
There's multiple Cheebies coming in after me, guys.

309
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:08,150
I can't... I could be...

310
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:12,710
I could be Doe Cheeby Prime if you guys want that.

449
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,300
So it's very hard to find them.

450
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:19,900
Okay guys.

451
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:21,520

00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,400
It takes a while to find these dookies.

01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:26,680
The good old times.

977
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:34,240
All right.

978
01:29:34,300 --> 01:29:35,080

01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:36,600
Any questions for me?

980
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:43,720
Do you guys have any questions for me?

981
01:29:59,910 --> 01:30:01,070
Why am I so cute?

982
01:30:01,830 --> 01:30:03,590
So it'll help you remember.

983
01:30:06,810 --> 01:30:07,110
Yes.

984
01:30:08,290 --> 01:30:10,670
A vote for me means more retro streams.

985
01:30:10,890 --> 01:30:11,730
Think about that.

986
01:30:12,530 --> 01:30:17,010
Don't you want to remember the times when she used to stream
more retro games?

987
01:30:17,330 --> 01:30:18,650
And by she, I mean me.

988
01:30:23,350 --> 01:30:25,070
So a vote for me.

989
01:30:25,710 --> 01:30:27,470
It's a vote to remember.

990
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:42,660
I don't even know if I'm...

991
01:30:42,660 --> 01:30:44,580
Am I 24-bit or 16-bit?

992
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:45,700
I couldn't count.

993
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:49,100
Like all dokees in every dokeverse.

994
01:30:49,260 --> 01:30:50,600
We're not very good at counting.

995
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:53,540
I just assume 24 because that's a big number.

996
01:30:54,140 --> 01:30:56,700
But do you remember all the bitties?

997
01:31:01,140 --> 01:31:03,260
Am I 24-bit or am I...

998
01:31:03,260 --> 01:31:04,580
Oh, I'm 24, right?

999
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:15,720
yeah I'm at least 24 there's so many colors on me I'm 24
bitty I look like I come from like Shovel Knight or some

1000
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:29,100
shit I would like to have an investigation whether or not
this Doki classifies as a chibi amongst other pixel

1001
01:31:29,100 --> 01:31:32,760
creatures self views thank you for the super chat thank you

1002
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:37,320
All right.

1003
01:31:38,940 --> 01:31:40,800
That's all the questions you have for me.

1004
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:51,220
Any other questions?

1005
01:32:04,190 --> 01:32:05,490
No other questions?

1006
01:32:06,950 --> 01:32:07,470
All right.

1007
01:32:08,050 --> 01:32:09,370
But don't forget.

1008
01:32:10,790 --> 01:32:11,450
Don't forget.

1009
01:32:13,150 --> 01:32:14,190
Always remember.

1010
01:32:15,550 --> 01:32:17,730
A vote for me is a vote to remember.

1011
01:32:21,090 --> 01:32:21,610
All right.

1012
01:32:21,770 --> 01:32:23,850
I guess I'll call in the intern now.

1013
01:32:24,810 --> 01:32:26,430
I guess the interview is over.

1014
01:32:38,420 --> 01:32:39,980
Yeah, we're trying to find the intern again.

1015
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:41,340
Yeah, I don't know.

1016
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:42,140
I don't know where she went.

1017
01:32:42,300 --> 01:32:42,580
No.

1018
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:45,320
I mean, you can call her, I guess.

1019
01:32:45,860 --> 01:32:47,280
I don't have her phone number.

1020
01:32:47,900 --> 01:32:49,700
I mean, like, she's an intern.

1021
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:52,180
Like, who the fuck has an intern's phone number?

1022
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:01,360
Oh, hey, guys.

1023
01:33:01,460 --> 01:33:01,880
Hey, guys.

1024
01:33:01,980 --> 01:33:02,360

01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:03,140
I'm back.

1026
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:04,340
I am back.

1027
01:33:04,860 --> 01:33:07,700
Oh, that was a lot longer than I expected.

1028
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:10,480
Whoa, I hope you guys had a fun time remembering.

1029
01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:14,940
Did you guys had a fun time remembering with candidate
number three?

1030
01:33:21,700 --> 01:33:23,140
What do you call her?

1031
01:33:24,580 --> 01:33:26,960
I feel like I need to remember something, but I don't...

1032
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:29,040
Thank you for the super chat.

1033
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:29,360
Thank you.

1034
01:33:29,820 --> 01:33:30,100
Thank you.

1035
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:34,340
So what do you guys...

1036
01:33:34,340 --> 01:33:35,660
Oh, I forgot to ask you guys.

1037
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:36,740
What are the names?

1038
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:41,680
You guys figured out what names you're calling candidate
number one, two, and three.

1039
01:33:42,900 --> 01:33:43,280
Doki bit.

1040
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:45,960
Doki bite.

1041
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:49,860
Doki bit.

1042
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:50,880
Doki bite.

1043
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:53,940
I wouldn't touch this Doki bro.

1044
01:33:54,060 --> 01:33:56,260
Any number of infinity feet long poles.

1045
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:58,660
I want to forget a happy thing.

1046
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:00,180
It was a super chat thinking thing.

1047
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:00,560
Yep.

1048
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:02,520
I see a lot of Doki bit.

1049
01:34:08,230 --> 01:34:09,350
Doki brat.

1050
01:34:09,590 --> 01:34:10,330
Brokey bit.

1051
01:34:10,530 --> 01:34:10,890
Brokey.

1052
01:34:11,010 --> 01:34:13,970
Brokey and dokey bit.

1053
01:34:23,130 --> 01:34:23,370
I don't know.

1054
01:34:23,470 --> 01:34:25,610
Those are the finalized names.

1055
01:34:25,930 --> 01:34:28,810
But I trust in you guys to settle on something soon.

1056
01:34:29,350 --> 01:34:29,650
All right.

1057
01:34:30,670 --> 01:34:38,510
We are going to have our fourth and final candidate for you
guys.

1058
01:34:40,010 --> 01:34:42,370
And then we'll have our vote.

1059
01:34:43,770 --> 01:34:44,150
So.

1060
01:34:45,090 --> 01:34:46,550
Are you guys excited?

1061
01:34:48,110 --> 01:34:58,630
There is one last candidate to be the representative of all
the chibi jokies out there.

1062
01:35:00,270 --> 01:35:00,290
Yes.

1063
01:35:01,390 --> 01:35:01,890
Yes.

1064
01:35:02,790 --> 01:35:06,950
She's at the fourth place, too, which obviously does not.

1065
01:35:06,970 --> 01:35:12,370
It's not really not that very lucky, but very cute.

1066
01:35:12,430 --> 01:35:14,210
I'm sure she will pull well.

1067
01:35:14,610 --> 01:35:16,790
Airboy Ninja, thank you for the super chat.

1068
01:35:17,050 --> 01:35:17,190
Thank you.

1069
01:35:17,290 --> 01:35:17,450
Thank you.

1070
01:35:17,950 --> 01:35:21,970
All of them seems to be able to poll very well here.

1071
01:35:23,430 --> 01:35:26,210
Anyway, before you guys are excited, right?

1072
01:35:26,390 --> 01:35:27,110
All right, also.

1073
01:35:27,710 --> 01:35:31,270
Also, who wants to vote for Doki Bit?

1074
01:35:33,610 --> 01:35:34,770
Who wants to vote for her?

1075
01:35:35,250 --> 01:35:36,430
Did she get, got your vote?

1076
01:35:36,510 --> 01:35:37,690
I forgot to ask you guys that.

1077
01:35:39,930 --> 01:35:41,210
Who wants to vote for her?

1078
01:36:02,370 --> 01:36:02,850
Yeah?

1079
01:36:03,610 --> 01:36:04,830
Cute, but no?

1080
01:36:05,370 --> 01:36:08,830
Why, alright, why, why didn't she win your vote, Dragoons?

1081
01:36:09,130 --> 01:36:09,890
What about her?

1082
01:36:10,090 --> 01:36:13,110
Made it so that it was that you wanted to vote for the
others instead.

1083
01:36:13,790 --> 01:36:15,590
What, what, what was it about her?

1084
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:26,740
Entered, please help the candidate brought a gun and shot a
fellow dragon.

1085
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:29,280
I didn't, I don't, I don't, I don't, come on, guys.

1086
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:30,240
They're so tiny.

1087
01:36:30,340 --> 01:36:30,960
What do you mean?

1088
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:32,260
They can't hurt a fly.

1089
01:36:33,080 --> 01:36:34,560
Thank you for the super chat news.

1090
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:35,560
Thank you, thank you.

1091
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:40,540
I think Brokey is just more fun.

1092
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:55,600
fun she made me feel old oh was she trying to make you
remember i heard of that about her yeah she she tries to

1093
01:36:55,600 --> 01:37:03,760
play the nostalgic angle but for some it doesn't really work
that well i don't trust nostalgia baiting

1094
01:37:11,150 --> 01:37:17,490
pat you're interested thank you for the super chat thank you
thank you for She was very cute, but I would prefer to

1095
01:37:17,490 --> 01:37:21,450
counsel a woman to bring something to the table other than
mentioning 2003.

1096
01:37:21,870 --> 01:37:24,410
And she's like, someone thank you for the super chat.

1097

1099
01:37:25,110 --> 01:37:25,490
All right.

01:37:25,790 --> 01:37:29,190
Are you guys ready for the last candidate, guys?

1101
01:37:32,510 --> 01:37:33,830
Are you guys ready?

1102
01:37:40,570 --> 01:37:41,050
Yeah?

1103
01:37:41,370 --> 01:37:41,910
Well, too bad.

1104
01:37:41,970 --> 01:37:43,670
You used the bathroom, so be right back.

1105
01:38:47,940 --> 01:38:48,400
All right.

1106
01:38:51,540 --> 01:38:56,480
Internus, sorry, I did not, I drank, I drank a lot of Clip
Doki, so I did not use the bathroom till now.

1107
01:38:56,900 --> 01:39:05,560
Uh, Rice, uh, Sharon, uh, Mehdi, Krim, McClufflicans, AK,
Nexi, oh my gosh, I'm getting closer.

1108
01:39:05,700 --> 01:39:07,920
Ha, well, every super chat I read, I get closer.

1109
01:39:08,100 --> 01:39:13,440
Solid, fight, Alan, Papa, thank you for this super chat,
thank you, thank you.

1110
01:39:13,820 --> 01:39:15,500
Yoko, thank you for this.

1111
01:39:15,880 --> 01:39:17,440
Om, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

1112
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:18,980
I'm so hungry.

1113
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:20,220
Om, yum, yum, yum, yum.

1114
01:39:23,680 --> 01:39:34,400
I like more of the neck of the second one oh yeah I see I
see yeah yeah not a lot a lot of dokeys are unfortunately

1115
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:43,880
not all dokeys are you know um the you know the true
bloodline you know the true dokey bloodline you know where

1116
01:39:43,880 --> 01:39:48,300
uh only the purest of dokeys can do this and unfortunately
some

1117
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:53,480
Doki's just aren't born with that, unfortunately.

1118
01:39:53,700 --> 01:39:56,420
And it's very sad, but we don't discriminate here.

1119
01:39:56,540 --> 01:39:57,660
We don't discriminate here.

1120
01:39:58,060 --> 01:39:59,520
Like, we treat all Doki's equally.

1121
01:40:02,840 --> 01:40:06,540
For some reason, they always demand these, like, bigger
seats for them.

1122
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:13,080
But, you know, if we have to make bigger seats for these
Doki's, that means we might need to make smaller seats for

1123
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:14,220
the bigger Doki's.

1124
01:40:14,580 --> 01:40:17,160
And, like we said, we treat every Doki equally.

1125
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:21,460
So, you know, we can't be providing people different seats.

1126
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:23,120
because that's not equal.

1127
01:40:28,060 --> 01:40:33,020
Anyway, let us bring the final jokie.

1128
01:40:35,340 --> 01:40:37,060
Let's call her out.

1129
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:38,380
The final one.

1130
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:42,380
You might even recognize her for some of you guys.

1131
01:41:19,220 --> 01:41:19,300
Oh.

1132
01:41:20,260 --> 01:41:22,700
Oh, I can't believe I'm last.

1133
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:25,720
Oh.

1134
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:44,900

little empty but to be fair like i thought i i i didn't

bearish right now, but I thought I thought I didn't have to
apply!

1274
01:54:07,920 --> 01:54:11,540

Space Thank you, the super chat Thank you, thank you yours

Oh, the vote, the polls will be out after my interview.

1284
01:55:27,560 --> 01:55:32,860
It's going to be on straw poll because we can make the
results anonymous.

1285
01:55:33,140 --> 01:55:33,880
Not hidden.

1286
01:55:34,660 --> 01:55:37,280
So it'll be a surprise for everyone, including us.

1287
01:55:39,040 --> 01:55:40,560
We're going to be doing a straw poll.

1288
01:55:40,680 --> 01:55:41,700

1300
01:56:40,080 --> 01:56:43,700
No, they're just exactly alike.

1301
01:56:44,260 --> 01:56:45,820
They're literally just the same.

1302
01:56:46,320 --> 01:56:47,980
But there's two of them now.

1303
01:56:52,260 --> 01:56:54,260
Double the lack of sleep, exactly.

1304
01:56:55,140 --> 01:56:57,740
Well, here we guys.

1305
01:56:58,020 --> 01:56:59,940

02:00:02,730 --> 02:00:09,470
Um, they're not, they're not looking for representatives for
3D Cheeby's yet.

1326
02:00:09,910 --> 02:00:15,170
Because, um, we didn't have our, we didn't have our 3D debut
yet.

1327
02:00:15,450 --> 02:00:19,030
So, I broke in.

1332
02:01:29,110 --> 02:01:32,010
Um, she was not supposed to appear today.

02:01:32,350 --> 02:01:38,990
Or like, she was, oh man, she, that, that's so, guys, I'm
sorry.

1334
02:01:39,070 --> 02:01:40,630
Like, that won't happen again.

1335
02:01:40,770 --> 02:01:50,710
Like I said, um, 3D Chibis are not included in um, in the
voting process.

1336
02:01:51,170 --> 02:01:53,190
Uh, It is in a different category.

1337
02:01:53,770 --> 02:01:56,970
Like I said, you know, we do, we already have a Cheeby Doki.

1338
02:01:57,610 --> 02:02:00,150
We already have a Cheeby Doki.

1339
02:02:00,650 --> 02:02:03,370
And we already have a 3D Cheeby Doki.

1340
02:02:03,870 --> 02:02:15,830
So it's like, you know, yeah, I know like, you know, the
council doesn't have, doesn't have the, I have a 3D

1341
02:02:15,830 --> 02:02:25,350

even have our debut sir you know if we have to give a 3d

1342
02:02:25,350 --> 02:02:33,670
chibi a a representative then we have to give the regular 3d
doki a representative but she didn't even have she hasn't

uh you know maybe her Doki port is, you know, suspended for

1345
02:02:56,390 --> 02:02:57,170
a little bit.

1346
02:02:58,170 --> 02:03:00,190
And, well, maybe we'll see her again one day.

1347
02:03:00,350 --> 02:03:01,470

We saw her again after a year.

1350

So, you know, maybe we'll see her again, too, in a year or
two, guys.

1351
02:03:11,650 --> 02:03:13,410
Maybe that'll happen.

Anyway, what did you think?

1353
02:03:22,170 --> 02:03:27,050

02:04:01,410 --> 02:04:04,030
What was about her that made you guys, you know...

1378
02:04:04,030 --> 02:04:05,370
It's like a focus group, you know?

1379

Like, what did you get?

1380
02:04:06,610 --> 02:04:08,490
Why didn't you want to vote for her, you know?

1381
02:04:08,530 --> 02:04:11,790
It's a good focus group for us to prepare for the next one.

1382
02:04:20,660 --> 02:04:21,540
Too sad.

1383
02:04:23,720 --> 02:04:27,460

This is a reason why I also didn't want to show the results
to you guys, like, while I'm voting, because that influenced

1493
02:14:07,420 --> 02:14:08,480
the choice as well.

1494
02:14:08,760 --> 02:14:11,280
So, like, you know, you'd be like, oh, they're winning
anyway, so I'll vote for it.

1495
02:14:11,300 --> 02:14:13,340
Or, like, oh, they're winning anyway, so I won't vote for
it.

1496
02:14:13,540 --> 02:14:16,700
But here, you guys don't know who's winning right now.

1497
02:14:16,840 --> 02:14:18,240
So you're voting with your hearts.

1498
02:14:20,320 --> 02:14:22,460
You're voting with your hearts right now.

1499
02:14:22,860 --> 02:14:24,920
But I will say it's very close.

1500
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,960
So each vote actually matters a lot.

1501
02:14:35,960 --> 02:14:37,040
Thank you for the super chat.

1502
02:14:37,120 --> 02:14:37,320
Thank you.

1503
02:14:37,560 --> 02:14:38,020
Thank you.

1504
02:14:38,780 --> 02:14:40,700
Five member gifts and jockey.

1505
02:14:40,840 --> 02:14:41,580
Ratt wins.

1506
02:14:41,860 --> 02:14:42,180
Lucky.

1507
02:14:42,340 --> 02:14:43,280
Thank you for the super chat.

1508
02:14:43,460 --> 02:14:43,640
Thank you.

1509
02:14:43,640 --> 02:14:44,300
Thank you.

1510
02:14:46,100 --> 02:14:48,160
Broke, she is just cool like that, bro.

1511
02:14:50,660 --> 02:14:51,620
All right.

1512
02:14:52,460 --> 02:14:53,140
I'll set it.

1513
02:14:53,140 --> 02:14:53,880
I'll do a timer.

1514
02:14:54,120 --> 02:14:58,860
Voting closes at 7.48.

1515
02:14:59,940 --> 02:15:00,960
You have three more.

1516
02:15:01,160 --> 02:15:03,820
Is that cheapy jockey with a steel chair?

1517
02:15:04,140 --> 02:15:05,100
You're going to think of the super chat.

1518
02:15:05,120 --> 02:15:05,360
Thank you.

1519
02:15:05,380 --> 02:15:05,840
Thank you.

1520
02:15:05,960 --> 02:15:10,180
In three minutes, I shall be closing the polls.

1521
02:15:18,160 --> 02:15:18,840
That's right.

1522
02:15:19,960 --> 02:15:21,980
Your vote matters.

1523
02:15:34,290 --> 02:15:36,750
Release Cheapy Prime from the coal mine.

1524
02:15:36,970 --> 02:15:38,050
So help me, Gordon.

1525
02:15:38,330 --> 02:15:38,990
Thank you, the Super Chat.

1526
02:15:39,130 --> 02:15:39,350
Thank you.

1527
02:15:39,710 --> 02:15:40,010
Thank you.

1528
02:15:40,570 --> 02:15:43,910
Doki Prap is the only correct choice.

1529
02:15:44,450 --> 02:15:44,990
Dragons.

1530
02:15:45,410 --> 02:15:46,510
Bird, they give the Super Chat.

1531
02:15:46,590 --> 02:15:46,790
Thank you.

1532
02:15:47,170 --> 02:15:47,510
Thank you.

1533
02:15:49,350 --> 02:15:50,930
Vote for a real, bro.

1534
02:15:51,470 --> 02:15:52,630
vote for Brokey.

1535
02:15:57,800 --> 02:15:59,220
Oh my god.

1536
02:15:59,460 --> 02:16:00,140
That's crazy.

1537
02:16:01,840 --> 02:16:03,780
I feel bad for the fourth Dokey.

1538
02:16:03,980 --> 02:16:04,300
Don't worry.

1539
02:16:04,400 --> 02:16:05,100
We won't tell her.

1540
02:16:05,440 --> 02:16:09,300
We won't tell her that she got the least amount of votes.

1541
02:16:13,660 --> 02:16:15,440
Mel, thank you for the super chat.

1542
02:16:15,720 --> 02:16:15,880
Thank you.

1543
02:16:15,920 --> 02:16:16,620
Thank you.

1544
02:16:16,620 --> 02:16:18,740
You wanted to vote for Dokey, Ben.

1545
02:16:18,840 --> 02:16:20,500
You want to vote for Dokey, Ben.

1546
02:16:20,760 --> 02:16:21,940
You want to remember.

1547
02:16:27,200 --> 02:16:28,820
No, I don't.

1548
02:16:41,010 --> 02:16:46,930
Do I only regret what this entire process is that you didn't
let us see the vote, so we can't pivot the vote out of

1549
02:16:46,930 --> 02:16:47,030
wrong.

1550
02:16:47,250 --> 02:16:50,170
That is why I didn't let you guys see the vote.

1551
02:16:50,490 --> 02:16:56,290
So you vote with your heart, even so you don't know who's
losing, and you vote with your heart.

1552
02:17:00,750 --> 02:17:05,890
I want you to vote with your heart on who you think deserves
it the most.

1553
02:17:07,010 --> 02:17:09,870
A vote for Doki Brat is a vote for Doki.

1554
02:17:11,810 --> 02:17:14,590
How dare you not let it be rigged?

1555
02:17:14,950 --> 02:17:15,550
Exactly!

1556
02:17:15,690 --> 02:17:17,090
You can't rig this!

1557
02:17:18,090 --> 02:17:22,490
You can't fucking work together to take someone down.

1558
02:17:35,790 --> 02:17:38,910
This is our last step to all our one!

1559
02:17:39,130 --> 02:17:40,830
Doki is Prime Believers!

1560
02:17:41,330 --> 02:17:42,890
Adjo, thank you for the super chat!

1561
02:17:42,930 --> 02:17:43,250
Thank you!

1562
02:17:43,630 --> 02:17:44,050
Thank you!

1563
02:17:45,410 --> 02:17:46,050
Alright.

1564
02:17:46,670 --> 02:17:47,970
It looks like...

1565
02:17:48,650 --> 02:17:51,810
the results are in

1566
02:17:58,260 --> 02:17:59,300
let us

1567
02:18:02,680 --> 02:18:05,340
let me try and figure out how to close it

1568
02:18:11,060 --> 02:18:17,180
close settings I already stopped the count guys so it
doesn't matter if you vote anymore I already stopped the

1569
02:18:17,180 --> 02:18:24,460
count oh it closed poll and the poll has been closed

1570
02:18:32,560 --> 02:18:59,240
stop the count the votes are here who won it was very very
close in the beginning it was like all three of them there

1571
02:18:59,240 --> 02:19:10,140
were three like 10 to 15 votes apart from each other one of
them two of them were like five votes apart from each other

1572
02:19:10,140 --> 02:19:15,280
and they were always like going up and down between each
other they were fighting for second and third place but the

1573
02:19:15,280 --> 02:19:27,160
first place and second place were always like 10 to 15 votes
apart from each other it was very very close it was very fun

1574
02:19:27,160 --> 02:19:30,400
to watch live and only me watching it

1575
02:19:38,580 --> 02:19:42,540
So, it's up to me to announce the winners.

1576
02:19:42,900 --> 02:19:44,220
But we can't announce it here, guys.

1577
02:19:44,320 --> 02:19:47,160
We gotta go somewhere nicer to announce it, guys.

1578
02:19:48,120 --> 02:19:51,340
So, why don't we head off right now?

1579
02:19:51,520 --> 02:19:51,920
Come on, guys.

1580
02:19:51,980 --> 02:19:56,360
I'll take you guys to our amphitheater, guys.

1581
02:19:57,680 --> 02:19:59,840
Funded by your fellow dragoons.

1582
02:20:46,400 --> 02:20:47,000
Wow!

1583
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,280
I can't believe.

1584
02:20:53,440 --> 02:20:57,260
I can't believe the boats are in.

1585
02:20:58,600 --> 02:20:59,620
You're new.

1586
02:21:01,860 --> 02:21:03,740
You're new.

1587
02:21:07,680 --> 02:21:09,520
New what, Doki?

1588
02:21:13,500 --> 02:21:15,620
You're new.

1589
02:21:16,780 --> 02:21:18,100
Cheapy representative.

1590
02:21:19,960 --> 02:21:25,960
Of all the Doki Cheebies in the Dokiverse is...

1591
02:21:26,940 --> 02:21:28,540
Drum roll, please?

1592
02:21:29,180 --> 02:21:30,240
Come on, dragons.

1593
02:21:30,960 --> 02:21:32,400
Yeah, give me some drum rolls.

1594
02:21:33,140 --> 02:21:34,640
If you want to know who won.

1595
02:21:40,020 --> 02:21:42,480
Where's the drum rolls, guys?

1596
02:21:52,360 --> 02:21:58,640
Five, four, three, two, one!

1597
02:22:03,480 --> 02:22:05,560
TV Prime?

1598
02:22:15,930 --> 02:22:17,370
Oh my god.

1599
02:22:18,190 --> 02:22:21,210
Thank you to everyone who voted for me.

1600
02:22:23,130 --> 02:22:25,190
I didn't think I'd win.

1601
02:22:26,290 --> 02:22:30,350
I thought you'd all forgot about me.

1602
02:22:34,320 --> 02:22:36,420
Thank you everyone for voting.

1603
02:22:37,900 --> 02:22:42,240
The results were very, very close.

1604
02:22:43,900 --> 02:23:03,560
actually crazy look how close the the poll was oh my god
released the files i literally just released it i thank you

1605
02:23:03,560 --> 02:23:14,500
a vote for me is a vote for two dads guys don't give it so

1606
02:23:19,730 --> 02:23:21,410
Thank you, everyone.

1607
02:23:23,590 --> 02:23:26,730
Thank you, my food has been nothing.

1608
02:23:27,290 --> 02:23:28,210
Let's go.

1609
02:23:33,820 --> 02:23:35,520
Thank you, everyone.

1610
02:23:36,680 --> 02:23:39,080
We have two dads now.

1611
02:23:43,830 --> 02:23:52,350
But yes, as the intern was saying, because we were looking
at the polls as well live with the other jokies, because,

1612
02:23:52,390 --> 02:23:54,050
you know, we're allowed to look at the polls.

1613
02:23:54,230 --> 02:24:00,830
And, um, um, so, oh my god, dad's here too.

1614
02:24:01,190 --> 02:24:02,790
Oh my god, the couple of the barks.

1615
02:24:03,730 --> 02:24:09,510
Um, as you guys know, um, okay, up.

1616
02:24:13,650 --> 02:24:16,010
Three of them were really close.

1617
02:24:16,110 --> 02:24:20,990
It was literally like five to 15 votes apart between the top
three.

1618
02:24:21,410 --> 02:24:24,210
They were always fighting for a first, second, and third
place.

1619
02:24:24,230 --> 02:24:35,950
but I I got past it I maintained first place for the longest
and I kept first place too so thank you everyone for voting

So before we started the voting process and the interviews

02:58:38,020 --> 02:58:41,220
Like, you, like, oh, and then, like, and then they're like,
can you give me the details?

1975
02:58:41,280 --> 02:58:42,380
Because I was like, can I give you the details?

1976
02:58:42,520 --> 02:58:43,080
Like, now?

1977
02:58:43,180 --> 02:58:45,040
And you're like, no, please wait till you're on your wait
list.

1978
02:58:45,180 --> 02:58:45,700
I'm like, okay.

1979
02:58:46,040 --> 02:58:49,860
And then I, and then I was just, I was in the fucking
trenches.

1980
02:58:51,640 --> 02:58:54,560
I was, I was in the fucking trenches.

1981
02:58:55,380 --> 02:58:55,800
Sorry.

1982
02:58:56,680 --> 02:58:58,200
So we did end up.

1983
02:58:58,660 --> 02:58:59,260
We didn't get it.

1984
02:58:59,260 --> 02:59:00,500
We could have got two more cannons.

1985
02:59:00,640 --> 02:59:02,000
But then I think that would be too long.

1986
02:59:02,280 --> 02:59:03,440
We would be like, and another one.

1987
02:59:03,740 --> 02:59:04,360
What was it?

1988
02:59:04,420 --> 02:59:05,940
What's the phrase called?

1989
02:59:06,280 --> 02:59:07,240
That's not all.

1990
02:59:11,000 --> 02:59:12,280
Is that what, like, I forgot.

1991
02:59:12,400 --> 02:59:14,120
There was a famous phrase.

1992
02:59:14,540 --> 02:59:17,700
Like, not another one, but like, uh, but wait.

1993
02:59:17,820 --> 02:59:18,060
Oh yeah.

1994
02:59:18,340 --> 02:59:18,900
But wait.

1995
02:59:19,060 --> 02:59:20,420
There's one more.

1996
02:59:21,100 --> 02:59:21,580
Yeah.

1997
02:59:21,720 --> 02:59:22,320
But wait.

1998
02:59:22,380 --> 02:59:23,340
There's more.

1999
02:59:23,760 --> 02:59:24,060
Yeah.

2000
02:59:26,900 --> 02:59:28,620
Yeah, thank God we only had four.

2001
02:59:31,380 --> 02:59:33,720
But wait, there's more.

2002
02:59:34,380 --> 02:59:35,620
It could have been.

2003
02:59:37,200 --> 02:59:41,800
All right, and finally, second place.

2004
02:59:44,080 --> 02:59:45,480
I gotta disappear again.

2005
02:59:46,340 --> 02:59:46,580
Whoa.

2006
03:00:00,370 --> 03:00:01,710
I got second place.

2007
03:00:03,010 --> 03:00:08,450
I saw some people were asking, like, when will the skater
outfit be done?

2008
03:00:08,670 --> 03:00:12,250
It will be done in one to two weeks.

2009
03:00:16,070 --> 03:00:18,710
It could be done in time, but that's okay.

2010
03:00:20,050 --> 03:00:23,710
We will have Skater Boy Doki soon.

2011
03:00:24,590 --> 03:00:26,390
It'll be done in one to two weeks, guys.

2012
03:00:28,230 --> 03:00:30,970
But here are the talent people that worked on Skater.

2013
03:00:31,110 --> 03:00:31,690
Oh, not Skater Boy.

2014
03:00:33,750 --> 03:00:34,630
Doki Brat.

2015
03:00:35,690 --> 03:00:37,650
Yeah, like, definitely has picked that name.

2016
03:00:37,870 --> 03:00:38,150
Really?

2017
03:00:38,810 --> 03:00:39,310
Really?

2018
03:00:40,510 --> 03:00:42,450
I can't believe it.

2019
03:00:44,750 --> 03:00:48,490
let me grab their Twitter handle.

2020
03:00:53,890 --> 03:00:54,990
Oh, I don't know the Twitter linked.

2021
03:00:55,110 --> 03:00:56,990
Okay, I gotta figure this out then.

2022
03:00:58,290 --> 03:00:59,910
Your Twitter's not linked.

2023
03:00:59,990 --> 03:01:00,570
Give me a sec.

2024
03:01:00,690 --> 03:01:01,730
I gotta figure this out.

2025
03:01:04,510 --> 03:01:06,790
You don't have a link to their Discord.

2026
03:01:10,270 --> 03:01:11,110
But I don't know.

2027
03:01:19,780 --> 03:01:20,540
Grabbing it.

2028
03:01:22,600 --> 03:01:30,560
all right got the artist and then let me grab the okay

2029
03:01:35,300 --> 03:01:44,100
artist is this one i remember i saw there like i said i saw
like you know the the skin suits and i was like oh my god

2030
03:01:44,100 --> 03:01:50,420
it's so cute and i was like it's so fluid and i was like i
want one too And then I'll just be like, hey, hey, buddy,

2031
03:01:51,380 --> 03:01:53,040
are you open for commissions?

2032
03:02:00,280 --> 03:02:01,280
And then...

2033
03:02:02,940 --> 03:02:04,820
They don't have their...

2034
03:02:04,820 --> 03:02:08,280
Wait, they also don't have their thing linked.

2035
03:02:08,920 --> 03:02:10,120
What is their Twitter handle?

2036
03:02:11,040 --> 03:02:12,320
Okay, give me a sec.

2037
03:02:13,200 --> 03:02:14,720
They also don't have it linked.

2038
03:02:14,800 --> 03:02:16,700
I need to figure out what their Twitter handle is.

2039
03:02:21,080 --> 03:02:23,220
That is the most unfortunate thing.

2040
03:02:23,400 --> 03:02:24,960
All right, I have to do investigation.

2041
03:02:25,720 --> 03:02:29,160
I do a communication all on Discord because I cannot handle
Twitter DMs.

2042
03:02:29,540 --> 03:02:31,400
I am so bad with Twitter DMs.

2043
03:02:35,900 --> 03:02:39,220
I hope you guys are going crazy with that song on loop.

2044
03:02:40,240 --> 03:02:45,320
This song has been on loop for the last three hours.

2045
03:02:47,600 --> 03:02:49,920
But no, I think Twitter DMs are just so messy in general.

2046
03:02:51,080 --> 03:02:59,120
The fact that, like, I, uh, I wish you can cat, like, you
can't, like, you can't categorize DMs, too.

2047
03:02:59,260 --> 03:03:01,400
Like, in overall, like, Discord and Twitter.

2048
03:03:04,850 --> 03:03:05,390
Give me a sec.

2049
03:03:05,490 --> 03:03:12,950
I'm still trying to find, I'm trying to find their Twitter
account, so I can just link it to you guys.

2050
03:03:15,210 --> 03:03:15,790
Oh, there you go.

2051
03:03:15,990 --> 03:03:16,590
I found it.

2052
03:03:18,830 --> 03:03:19,210
Okay.

2053
03:03:24,930 --> 03:03:33,670

2069
03:05:36,850 --> 03:05:38,510
Alan, thank you for the super chat.

2070
03:05:38,690 --> 03:05:38,850
Thank you.

2071
03:05:38,850 --> 03:05:40,670
Thank you for the love of God.

2072
03:05:40,770 --> 03:05:43,050
Use the Taka's word.

2073
03:05:44,610 --> 03:05:47,410
I'm using them a lot more than I used to now, guys.

2074
03:05:47,510 --> 03:05:48,350
I'm improving.

2075
03:05:49,250 --> 03:05:52,110
I'm actually improving little by little.

2076
03:05:54,750 --> 03:05:55,010
Mm-hmm.

2077
03:05:55,750 --> 03:05:56,950
I'm getting better at it.

2078
03:05:57,110 --> 03:05:58,390
I think I realized I could use my...

2079
03:05:58,390 --> 03:06:00,550
I'm actually using my stream deck now, too.

2080
03:06:01,970 --> 03:06:02,490
Slowly.

2081
03:06:03,910 --> 03:06:07,650
Back in the old times, I rarely ever use any toggles.

2082
03:06:08,030 --> 03:06:08,970
So, like...

2083
03:06:08,970 --> 03:06:11,250
So this is an improvement now, guys.

2084
03:06:11,570 --> 03:06:12,670
This is an improvement.

2085
03:06:15,090 --> 03:06:16,910
But yeah, I think that's everything.

2086
03:06:17,130 --> 03:06:18,470
Am I missing anything, guys?

2087
03:06:27,070 --> 03:06:28,210
Am I missing anything?

2088
03:06:30,250 --> 03:06:31,050
Just want to be sure.

2089
03:06:32,590 --> 03:06:36,070
How many times would you use if you had a hundred percent
key for it?

2090
03:06:37,130 --> 03:06:38,310
Thank you, Lucerne Chat.

03:12:55,250 --> 03:12:55,630

2153
03:12:59,030 --> 03:13:00,050
Thank you, friend.

2154
03:13:00,290 --> 03:13:02,290
Thanks for the raccoon pictures.

2155
03:13:04,670 --> 03:13:05,230
Thank you.

2156
03:13:06,670 --> 03:13:14,870
Okay, so Twitter did this new update where you have to open
the DMs to hide the Twitter notifications now.

2157
03:13:14,970 --> 03:13:19,550
Because in the past, you can just click on the DM button,
and then the notification goes away.

2158
03:13:20,310 --> 03:13:30,170
So, because Frail sends me a raccoon picture every day, I
have to open her DMs now to get rid of the notification.

2159
03:13:34,430 --> 03:13:41,070
I can't, like, just click on the icon, and then, like, I
don't have to, in the past, you don't have to click on the

2160
03:13:41,070 --> 03:13:42,010
DM itself.

2161
03:13:45,070 --> 03:13:50,370
it actually stays there now so like and then like when it
says like two or three messages it'll be from the same

2162
03:13:50,370 --> 03:14:02,590
person and then like um isn't that harassment so so like so
like i actually have to open her dms to like get rid of it

2163
03:14:02,590 --> 03:14:13,250
because she was the target audience for this update yeah so
now i actually have to look at it

2164
03:14:16,390 --> 03:14:24,770
um but yes oh also the really fun thing i um about this is
that you know how like i always say um branding is

2165
03:14:24,770 --> 03:14:36,830
everything so obviously i i don't want like you know uh for
my actual like for the the the big skin suits um um you know

2166
03:14:36,830 --> 03:14:43,070
i want to keep with my mama for as long as i can just
because of like you know branding and i always loved her all

2167
03:14:43,070 --> 03:14:51,190
right um but like with the i can experiment with all kinds
of styles you know all kinds of cheebies and all different

2168
03:14:51,190 --> 03:14:58,910
kinds of styles and that's something i wanted to do when i
first started streaming i was like for those who were a bark

2169
03:14:58,910 --> 03:15:14,470
knight uh who was a uh bark knight um um i this is like lore
from a long time ago but I talked about how before Iron

2170
03:15:14,470 --> 03:15:22,490
Mouse did her thing where she got skin suits from so many
different artists and stuff um I talked about doing wanting

2171
03:15:22,490 --> 03:15:29,970
to do that before Iron Mouse did that and I remember talking
to my bark knights I was like I want to be able to have all

2172
03:15:29,970 --> 03:15:38,790
these different skin suits from all these different artists
and I'll see their interpretation of dokeybird and and i was

2173
03:15:38,790 --> 03:15:49,110
before i uh graduated the first time um i was actually gonna
debut a new skin suit you can actually see it in the vod too

2174
03:15:49,110 --> 03:15:56,090
you can see in the um in the graduation vod where i was like
showing everyone like this was gonna be my next skin suit

2175
03:15:56,090 --> 03:16:02,130
that i was gonna like do and i was gonna increase i was
gonna like have more and more like get more and stuff and

2176
03:16:02,130 --> 03:16:05,990
like increase my collection of different artists and stuff
like that.

2177
03:16:06,610 --> 03:16:08,850
And this was like something I actually really wanted to do.

2178
03:16:09,050 --> 03:16:12,870
And I think like, I think I would have been the first one
person to like sort of do that.

2179
03:16:13,590 --> 03:16:15,070
Because I was like, I was going to do that.

2180
03:16:15,270 --> 03:16:18,770
And then, and then I had like one plan and it already and
everything.

2181
03:16:18,890 --> 03:16:20,330
I was going to fucking do it.

2182
03:16:25,450 --> 03:16:30,110
But now I'm obviously like, I don't really want to do it.

2183
03:16:30,170 --> 03:16:31,730
Like I can't really do that anymore.

2184
03:16:32,130 --> 03:16:33,910
But I could do that for Cheebies.

2185
03:16:34,450 --> 03:16:40,870
And I love collecting different artists, like
interpretations of me as well, as well as collecting like

2186
03:16:40,870 --> 03:16:42,230
different outfits and everything.

2187
03:16:42,750 --> 03:16:47,330
Because, you know, I love, I just love seeing how other
artists draw me and stuff.

2188
03:16:47,450 --> 03:16:49,150
And just how I love art in general.

2189
03:16:50,050 --> 03:16:54,290
I was a big, a lot of, I commissioned a lot of artists back
then.

2190
03:16:54,650 --> 03:16:56,290
Like I wasn't even like, I wasn't anyone.

2191
03:16:56,510 --> 03:17:01,870
Everyone sort of knew me as the person that they would see
my, I was an OC.

2192
03:17:02,130 --> 03:17:09,030
first like i was like you see like me and they're like oh
it's this person this person commissioned so many artists

2193
03:17:09,030 --> 03:17:15,250
because like i just love art in general and i just love
seeing people draw me in general like draw my oc in general

2194
03:17:15,250 --> 03:17:25,610
so i was like my like me i was everywhere like retro doki
was everywhere because of it um um so like that was just

2195
03:17:25,610 --> 03:17:31,930
another thing like vtune was another thing to be to collect
you know like if i was thank god i'm not in like i'm not a

2196
03:17:32,130 --> 03:17:38,630
into like art galleries and stuff because I think I would
have gone broke with how spending millions of dollars on art

2197
03:17:38,630 --> 03:17:49,810
like spending like you know like framed gallery photos and
like not for gallery art and stuff like that um and uh and

2198
03:17:49,810 --> 03:17:56,930
you know being able to have like all these different chibi
uh skin suits is really fun I hope to expand my collection

2199
03:17:56,930 --> 03:17:58,510
more and more in the future

2200
03:18:08,110 --> 03:18:08,550
Thank you.

2201
03:18:08,630 --> 03:18:11,630
Not to get almost sure anything, but I'm proud of where you
are now compared two years ago.

2202
03:18:11,870 --> 03:18:16,250

Thank you for being here with us.

2253
03:22:02,910 --> 03:22:03,470
Thank you.

2254
03:22:03,510 --> 03:22:03,950
Thank you, Lucita.

2255
03:22:04,210 --> 03:22:06,090
No, thank you guys for being here with me.

2256
03:22:07,670 --> 03:22:13,010
There's, like, like I said, many times I really wanted to
quit, and, like, I had, like, you know, breakdowns about

2257
03:22:13,010 --> 03:22:14,370
content creation, because it's hard.

2258
03:22:14,630 --> 03:22:20,090
Like, I know people are like, yeah, but it's not as hard as
a real job, but it's hard in its own way.

2259
03:22:20,590 --> 03:22:27,510
You know, um, it's hard in its own way, and still, I'm a
perfectionist when it comes to these things, and I always

2260
03:22:27,510 --> 03:22:29,230
want to do fun things with my dragon.

2261
03:22:29,490 --> 03:22:32,710
And so I always want to make you guys, you know, I don't
just want to play video games.

2262
03:22:32,730 --> 03:22:44,150
and um play video games and just like i feel like i'm always
what's the way i feel like i'm like slacking if i just do

2263
03:22:44,150 --> 03:22:50,530
that so i always want to do like fun things for you guys
like these types of streams and fun events and fun like

2264
03:22:50,530 --> 03:22:58,690
presents and projects for everyone i don't want to what's i
used to say a lot where i'm just it's not slacking but

2265
03:22:58,690 --> 03:23:05,430
what's that word i haven't used in a while I think I don't
believe her lies.

2266
03:23:06,870 --> 03:23:10,070
Just because I take a bribe doesn't mean that I'm corrupt.

2267
03:23:13,710 --> 03:23:15,090
No, that's coasting.

2268
03:23:15,150 --> 03:23:15,890
I don't want to coast.

2269
03:23:16,690 --> 03:23:18,730
I always want to help make lots of fun.

2270
03:23:19,030 --> 03:23:20,130
Yeah, I don't want to post.

2271
03:23:20,210 --> 03:23:21,550
I have been procrastinating a lot, though.

2272
03:23:21,550 --> 03:23:25,390
I think 2025 has been my most procrastinated year so far.

2273
03:23:25,710 --> 03:23:27,890
I think it's because I did so many events, too.

2274
03:23:28,170 --> 03:23:32,710
Because, like, events do tire me out a lot because I'm
talking a lot.

2275
03:23:32,730 --> 03:23:42,430
lot to a lot of people like um i'm like interacting a lot
too so events really do like take away a lot of my energy

2276
03:23:42,430 --> 03:23:49,270
but i still want to keep doing events and everything because
i want to meet as many dragons um one to one with as many

2277
03:23:49,270 --> 03:23:54,970
dragons as possible because um you know it's such a rare
opportunity to be able to have that and it's such a great

2278
03:23:54,970 --> 03:24:00,530
memory to have too like talking to you guys like you know
talking to your oshi talking to your fans and everything

2279
03:24:00,530 --> 03:24:06,670

Thank you.

2310
03:24:58,570 --> 03:25:01,070
By the way, I'm so hungry.

2311
03:25:02,370 --> 03:25:11,890
but my stomach was growling like in the last hour and I was
like oh my god I hope they don't hear my stomach growling I

2312
03:25:11,890 --> 03:25:22,490
like I've been working non-stop on this and the Christmas
stuff and next new year event like I swear I felt like I was

2313
03:25:22,490 --> 03:25:31,710
doing nine to five with overtime I would I I took up I slept
five hours today I mean five hours is better than like five

2314
03:25:31,710 --> 03:25:37,610
hours is actually pretty decent like i could have slept
three hours but um like i sent an alarm it was like three

2315
03:25:37,610 --> 03:25:45,170
hours actually i set up three hour alarm and i woke up and i
was like no like i was like i woke up i was like the alarm

2316
03:25:45,170 --> 03:25:55,270
woke me i was like no i said like two more hours i was like
okay i need this two hours no i have leftovers i left over

2317
03:25:55,270 --> 03:26:03,250
from yesterday so i'll heat that up after this stream um but
i felt like i was doing nine to five plus overtime the last

2318
03:26:03,250 --> 03:26:08,570
three days the last three days i've just been like working
non-stop for all the events and stuff it didn't really help

2319
03:26:08,570 --> 03:26:15,070
that i had this idea like literally this week like the
finalized idea of how i want to how i really want because

2320
03:26:15,070 --> 03:26:21,330
like i was like back and forth with so many things because i
was like i was like oh what do i how do i how do i just

2321
03:26:21,330 --> 03:26:25,370
debut a bunch of like cheapy skin suits like how do i do
that

2322
03:26:29,030 --> 03:26:35,610
This idea went through so many drafts leading up to my
finalized idea for this week When I say I did all this this

2323
03:26:35,610 --> 03:26:42,090
week, I meant my finalized plan I've been have other ideas I
had was like different from this idea But I kept like going

2324
03:26:42,090 --> 03:26:49,210
back and forth as to what I really wanted to do So so in the
end I settled to this one on this week because I was like no

2325
03:26:49,210 --> 03:27:00,050
I think this is the perfect way and then like I had the
whole image I've always wanted to do a the Doki verse even

2326
03:27:00,050 --> 03:27:10,710
when I was in Corpo like expand the verse but in Corpo I was
never able to able to like make that a reality because

2327
03:27:10,710 --> 03:27:20,870
there's a lot of rules and regulations for it like at best I
could only do PNGs and stuff so obviously that never came to

2328
03:27:20,870 --> 03:27:30,330
fruition because of it because I was just like oh PNGs are
just not not it's not as as like memorable I felt like

2329
03:27:30,330 --> 03:27:36,350
because it would be cool if we could actually if I could
actually move and everything and so I've had this idea in my

2330
03:27:36,350 --> 03:27:43,810
head about this whole universe in my head oh it'd be really
fun to do like play around with like building the lore and

2331
03:27:43,810 --> 03:27:49,210
everything because you can mess around with a lot of stuff
you know lots of like versions of your set lots of

2332
03:27:49,210 --> 03:27:56,590
creativity you can do with it like i remember like the
different like verses you can do it's always a multiverse is

2333
03:27:56,590 --> 03:28:01,170
always such a fun concept to play around with because you
can fuck around with a bunch of stuff because like it's not

2334
03:28:01,170 --> 03:28:08,290
your lore it's a different doke's lore you know like it's
like yeah like this happened to this doke like not the other

2335
03:28:08,290 --> 03:28:14,730
doke so i can like make a fucking dumbass lore for different
types of doke and i was like i want to be garfield and i'm

2336
03:28:14,730 --> 03:28:24,510
like yeah i'm dokefield from the garfield from the dokefield
universe like like yeah like shit like it's like i'm doki by

2337
03:28:24,510 --> 03:28:36,650
from like i'm not the like this is my doki verse yeah i'm
gonna surround as much as it's been like a fun concept

2338
03:28:36,650 --> 03:28:43,590
that's been rattling around my head so i hope you guys
enjoyed the expanded lore of the doki verse um that i made

2339
03:28:43,590 --> 03:28:53,030
up in this week i wrote the fucking script for three days
ago i literally had to look up model United Nations glossary

2340
03:28:53,030 --> 03:28:59,950
terms because I forgot how like meetings worked and I just
had like the basic I was like oh my god what do I call like

2341
03:28:59,950 --> 03:29:05,970
what do I call like when you use you like do the gavel and
stuff be like and I was like oh decorum oh my god yeah

2342
03:29:05,970 --> 03:29:15,510
decorum decorum delegates decorum I just try to remember how
council meetings work yeah because I used to do model UN so

2343
03:29:15,510 --> 03:29:22,790

yeah I used to be a fucking nerd I had like I used to do

2344
03:29:22,790 --> 03:29:35,650
model UN so I had like a general knowledge of how fucking
council meetings work and stuff uh so so I was like digging

Thank you.

2353
03:29:58,230 --> 03:29:59,790
What happened to Nerd Duke?

2354
03:29:59,910 --> 03:30:00,810
She discovered gaming.

2355
03:30:01,470 --> 03:30:02,810
It was one or the other chat.

2356
03:30:03,230 --> 03:30:08,330
You know, you're like, you're upgrading your stats, and you
have to sacrifice some stats to go to the other.

2357
03:30:08,650 --> 03:30:12,130
Ever since I discovered competitive gaming, it went downhill
from there.

2358
03:30:12,230 --> 03:30:16,110
I took away the IQ points from my stats and put it all in
dexterity.

2359
03:30:18,980 --> 03:30:19,420
Ha ha ha.

2360
03:30:21,220 --> 03:30:21,940

2361
03:30:22,340 --> 03:30:23,740
I min-maxed.

2362
03:30:29,360 --> 03:30:31,600
I did a stat reset, yeah.

2363
03:30:32,180 --> 03:30:34,400
I dumped Intelligent for Dex.

2364
03:30:41,570 --> 03:30:42,910

But yeah, I will say again, thank you again for all the
support.

2370
03:30:52,250 --> 03:30:54,650

me, obviously.

2371
03:30:54,670 --> 03:30:55,390

2372
03:30:55,590 --> 03:30:56,150
This is my income.

2373
03:30:56,630 --> 03:30:59,270

2374
03:30:59,650 --> 03:31:07,430
So I couldn't do all these super fun streams, or I couldn't
keep doing all these projects and games because you guys

so many fun memories.

2376
03:31:12,770 --> 03:31:14,490
Like, yo-yo, you only live once.

2377
03:31:14,590 --> 03:31:18,150
So I want to create as many fun memories as I can before,
you know, it's all gone.
