1
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,440
Look, I have a perfectly good excuse for this.

2
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,540
I was on a five-game loss streak on my four rivals.

3
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:46,040
And I was like, maybe I can try one more game.

4
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,980
And then I have 20 minutes left.

5
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,440
Maybe I can try one more game.

6
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,820
You can never end on a loss, guys.

7
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,040
You can never end on a loss.

8
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:07,260
So I was just like, maybe I'm on a five game last streak.

9
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:11,320
There's no way I'll lose a sixth game.

10
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,960
There's no fucking way.

11
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,740
And then, oh my God.

12
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,680
Okay, I need to show you this.

13
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,740
On my very first game, I got a VTuber on my team.

14
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,840
And I got a French VTuber on my team.

15
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,820
You'd be like, what does being French have to do with
whatever?

16
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,180
Okay, no, I will show you.

17
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:50,460
There is a perfectly good reason why I have to be very
specific on this.

18
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,060
Okay, let me save this.

19
00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:02,100
Okay, my first game of the day, this guy started, by the
way, his name is a T.

20
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:09,800
TV name too so like you know It's gonna go so well so And he
would but the best part he was a TV name and he was off

21
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:17,280

lost our first fight so i was like what the fuck is going on

26
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:07,060

started calling the tanks garbage he started called DPS

29
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:35,980
Garage but oh he was the one that was performing the best
apparently so I was like bro like bro what the fuck I was

30
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:42,880
like bro and then like if you look him up he's a vtuber so I
was like bro don't give vtubers a bad name right now there's

31
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:53,500
a there's a war going on like we don't need this shit like
so I chimed in and I was like I was like how are you a

32
00:04:53,500 --> 00:05:01,400
vtuber So I chimed in and I was like, how are you a VTV?

33
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,360
Because obviously, like, I'm in this game.

34
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,740
And then he's like, how are you useless?

35
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,560
And he's like, yeah, I'm done.

36
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,220
GG, how are you useless?

37
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,760
And then, and I'm like, Mal, you ain't making a kid.

38
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,920
Because at that point, I was like, bro, like, you're like
just fucking firing random shots everywhere.

39
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:25,980
Like, he was just insulting everyone.

40
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,760
And then I was just like, at least I know how to play.

41
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,180
And then I checked his profile.

42
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,020
I checked his Twitch profile.

43
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,200
Or like his, okay, I did that too.

44
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,980
But I also checked his, because you know, I'm a fucking
petty person.

45
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,780
I'm a fucking petty person.

46
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,920
So I checked his rivals account because it's like not
private.

47
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,960
And he was Peak Celestio 1.

48
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,220
And I was like, bro, don't speak.

49
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:05,260
He speaks unless don't fucking speak and I looked at his
twitch user profile And he's like don't be toxic.

50
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:12,960
We're all here to have fun I just want to make you laugh and
then he said this shit and I was like bro What the fuck?

51
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:21,800
Oh, yeah, you'd see this shit offline thinking nobody's
gonna fucking call you out like Literally smirked his feet

52
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:32,500
guy like like the it's like those people hate and they're
the ones like fucking spreading hate like like it's so

53
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:41,440

54
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:51,760

here to spread laughter and I'm like like and then literally

55
00:06:51,760 --> 00:07:01,580
the first thing he said in this game first game by the way
started fucking bullets at all our teammates like oh don't

56
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:13,160
spread hate only i can spread hate like hypocrite as fuck by
the way like do as i say not as i do and like it sucked

57
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:19,040
because he was like a vtuber too so like obviously it makes
us look bad that's why i was like how are you a vtuber

58
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:25,500
because i was like what the fuck are you doing so like i was
like bro what the fuck you're all you're doing is just

59
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,920

60
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:39,740
yeah oh but don't spread yeah but don't don't harass him by
the way don't don't go harass this guy this guy's a fucking

61
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:50,920
loser um like i said you ain't making a kid like yeah
setting hurt people back just don't like stoop to his level

62
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:56,980
i had to call him out because like He thought there was no
consequences to his actions because he thought he was like,

63
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,480
there's no other streamer here.

64
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:03,820
The fact that he didn't know who I was as a VTuber, I'm just
like, that's on you.

65
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,920
Like, that's on you.

66
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,340
Yeah, so like, it was fucking great.

67
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,020
That was my first, I wish I was streaming this, by the way.

68
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,140
I wish I was streaming this.

69
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,440
This was my very first game.

70
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,280
And then, okay, bro, very humble.

71
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,660
I was going to keep varying.

72
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,860
Look, he was like shit talking everyone on our team.

73
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,940
The thing is, I was the only one typing back.

74
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,540
Everyone was just like calling him out in BC because
everyone else had BC.

75
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,200
I was too lazy to talk at that time because I was just like,
I'll just do, at first I was like, I'll just do two or three

76
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,580
games and I'm going to go, I'm just going to go like chill
after that.

77
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,720
And then I end up playing five, six games because I lost
five games in a row.

78
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:58,360
Like, maybe if I keep going, I'll eventually win one game.

79
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:05,600
So, yeah, the first game was a fucking omen.

80
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:06,880
And then it progressed.

81
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:15,640
And then on my, I think on my fourth game, I got a girl who
would say, who was like, I don't know how she's back, but

82
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,480
she's like, she was like, I'm banned on.

83
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,040
Apparently she made a new Twitch account and a new Twitter
account.

84
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:28,260
But like I had my team was throwing because one of our
teammates on our team is like super homophobic Super racist

85
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:38,660
and also super transphobic because she said all the words
She like in the past she used to say she said all the slurs

86
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:45,320
like all the gamer slurs back then So like like people on my
team were like yeah We're not fucking gonna win this like

87
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:51,620
like I we have this girl on our team and after we everyone
was like talking about being like, wait, aren't you that

88
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,440
girl that's like, that said like all these slurs?

89
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:59,560
Because there's like proof of her saying all these slurs,
saying like all the gamer slurs.

90
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,340
And that the whole vocabulary, yeah, all of them.

91
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:02,960
That's what I'm saying.

92
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,800
She was super racist, super homophobic, and super
transphobic.

93
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,420
She literally said everything.

94
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,840
And she's still trying to make a career.

95
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,820
Like she literally got her Twitch fan at one point.

96
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:16,540
I remembered.

97
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:27,160
and yeah the whole dictionary and and then like um and then
so like my team didn't want to try so obviously that's

98
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:34,980
another loss in the belt uh and then after everyone said
that to her she was like she was like here's my twitch

99
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,320
follow me in chat

100
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:49,020
he was like i was like bro Diamond, please, bro.

101
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,920
Diamond, please just drops her plug.

102
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,680
She, like, yeah, respect that.

103
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,620
She just starts plugging herself.

104
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,080
We lost, too.

105
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,320
We actually, like, shameless.

106
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,980
Like, we lost, and then, like, there was a reason why we
lost.

107
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,360
And then she plugged herself afterwards.

108
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,500
I'm like, what the fuck?

109
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,980
It's just, like, it's just, like, what's the word?

110
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:31,700
so like no no what's the word no like social cues whatsoever
like any exposure is exposure yeah yeah girl read the room

111
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:43,680
girl read the room yeah um and then and then i had my last
game where i was like i'll do one more game i have 20

112
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:49,800
minutes i didn't think it would be that fucking long by the
way but we had so many overtime pushes that it took the game

113
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:58,200
lasted like 20 plus minutes it lasted 20 to 25 minutes and
which i didn't expect because i was like we have like you

114
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:05,980
know i had it was like um 440 and i was just like i have
like so much time like we're gonna finish this game by then

115
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:11,580
and i was like you know we can't end on the loss you know
can never end on a loss So I was just like, yeah, all that

116
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:21,080
for a fucking, okay, so we had no support players other than
me and um Our guy was on rocket and like you didn't know he

117
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:27,920
was clueless he literally he even rocket is like the
character where You don't need hands and you still play

118
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:37,620
rocket, but he was so fucking clueless because he had zero
brain because um because the rocket kept asking um our dps

119
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:47,100
players when she should so he held his rock we were getting
dived on by everything it was hard dive like daredevil venom

120
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:55,600
iron fist like all fucking grabbing on to me and the rocket
and then i was just like oh my god you're all right and then

121
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:02,220
he's like let me know when to all like yelling at our dps
let me know when to all and he held it we were getting

122
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:11,080
fucking like harassed and touched and he still held it and
then we all died and then he was like okay and was but then

123
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:17,800
like me and the rocket we died but then the rest of the team
still live for some fucking reason and then the second time

124
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:27,620
it happened again but before the dive um he was like asking
our dps like oh let me know when to all just let me know um

125
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:33,680
i have uh which of course he had because he's been holding
that shit forever and then it happened again.

126
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:39,420
They fucking Thor, Venom, Iron Fist, Derodouble, fucking
went straight to us.

127
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,520
Like, there was no hope.

128
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,140
And then he still didn't halt.

129
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,000
He still held it.

130
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,940
Because he heard no reply.

131
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:55,100
Because our DPS players didn't respond to him.

132
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,940
So he's like, well, if I didn't hear an answer, I shouldn't
at all.

133
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,780
Because I have no free will.

134
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,560
I'm just a rocket player.

135
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:14,620
I was like How the fuck are you still holding it Like that
Five, four out of the six players On the enemy team

136
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:23,880
Literally ran into us And yet you just, you're like We'll
live Like actual sheep behavior He's like Don't worry guys

137
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:35,620
We'll live Yeah And then And then he started flaming our
tanks Because he thinks our tanks was the problem.

138
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,060
Maybe they were.

139
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,100
But you were also part of the problem.

140
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,460
He tried to like defer the blame.

141
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,980
Being like, oh it's not my fault.

142
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:43,460
Is there tanks?

143
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,100
Our tanks didn't know how to play tank.

144
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:49,120
Yeah, he started flaming our tanks because of all of this.

145
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,000
And I'm like, bro, I saw you.

146
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,940
Hold your ult for at least two fights.

147
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:58,620
You have no right to say anything.

148
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:14,980
it was anyone but himself yeah it was crazy um so yeah those
were those were my six games um I won you can know the crazy

150
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:40,960

that I lost five six games in a row right after that I like

151
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:48,440
he kept trying to force us to surrender this guy kept voting
for surrender he kept fucking voting for surrender and none

152
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:56,140
of us surrendered and we we won I don't fucking know how I I
don't know how we did it so I lost six out of the seven

153
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:06,060
games yeah yeah I used up all my luck just to try and pull
up a win Anyway, so that was my Marvel Rivals journey, and

154
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,800
that was why I was 10 minutes late.

155
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,320
I never give up until the sixth loss.

156
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,060
So that was why I was late.

157
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,580
Other thing, I watched FNAF 2.

158
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,100
I finally watched FNAF 2.

159
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,520
I don't remember which day it was.

160
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,280
All these days are like blurring together.

161
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:39,580
as someone that has watched finaf one their members members
it doesn't mean you're safe by the way guys we're still

oh thank god that means we don't have to no no no no no no

163
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:52,820
no don't worry it'll still be a member stream in the future
but i just had to check it out because like people were like

164
00:16:52,820 --> 00:17:00,400
no it is better than the first movie because the first movie
was an experience it really was like not the greatest but i

165
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:17,340
will say is an improvement to the first movie it has a lot
less plot holes but I will say um the second movie was

166
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:27,040
definitely made for fans because like I swear to God every
other scene or every okay yeah every other scene was like

167
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:35,780
look at this oh my god this was in FNAF oh my this was also

179
00:17:59,340 --> 00:17:59,360
And,

180
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:08,800
Blah-holes this time because the first movie I was so fucked

fixed that Yeah, did you see it?

Oh, I remember.

192
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,680
And, oh, my God, did you see the baby animatronic in the
dream?

00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,320
That's not till FNAF 5 or some shit.

194
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:51,960
Oh, yeah.

195
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:57,740
By the way, I was asking my friend, because I was, like,
telling my friend, I watched FNAF, and they're like, oh, did

196
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,060

197
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,260
Do you know what game that's from?

198
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,660
And I'm like, I don't know, FNAF 3, FNAF 4.

199

203
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:51,520

them um so that was basically for now too but the craziest

204
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:58,060
part i wanted to buy a popcorn bucket because like um i
thought figured like you know i low-key started wanting to

205
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:10,100
collect popcorn buckets right yeah i'm part they got me ever
since the zootopia popcorn bucket i they got me i understand

206
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:20,420
now like they got another one uh please do not collect this
um anyway but only for like the ones that i thought the

207
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:31,680
designs are really interesting so um so i saw the popcorn
bucket for fanab um during like zootopia they put it out

208
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:36,780
being like coming soon So I was like, oh, okay, I really
want to buy the FNAF one because it's really funny.

209
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
It's really funny looking.

210
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,600
So I, like, went over there.

211
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:44,720
Like, you know, I went to the theater and I was like, where
are the popcorn buckets for FNAF?

212
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,960
There's one for Avatar.

213
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,580
There's one for still ones for Zootopia.

214
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,660
Zootopia ones are still around with the snake.

215
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:57,380
And then still, there was still the ones for, like, Wicked
and, like, all that other shit.

216
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:00,120
And, like, Tron 2, Tron Ares, rest in peace.

217
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:07,720
And so I was really confused because I was like, oh, what
happened?

218
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,280
So then I asked one of the movie guys, and they're like, oh
yeah, they're all sold out.

219
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,140
I'm like, what?

220
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,800
Like, how?

221
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,300
Like, the Zootopia ones are still here.

222
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:22,900
And they're like, oh yeah, no, we sold out on the first
couple of days.

223
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,540
I'm like, what the fuck?

224
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:29,660
I was just like, the movie came out like a week and a half
ago.

225
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,580
How the fuck is it all sold out?

226
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,220
So then I looked it.

227
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,460
I was so confused.

228
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,780
So I looked it up online.

229
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,160
They're getting scalped.

230
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,740
No, they're getting, you know how much they cost right now?

231
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,220
Like all of the FNAF movie buckets.

232
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:56,720
They cost 250 American dollars for a FNAF popcorn bucket.

233
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,660
And you, the retail price is like $50.

234
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,640
And I was like, what the?

235
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,920
I was like, are you guys serious?

236
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,720

237
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,180

Welcome.

260
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,020

00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:32,800
Thank you.

264
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:36,260
Speaking of Zootopia, did you hear the snake characters
gotten so popular in China?

265
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,760
People are starting to buy them as pets.

266
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:38,020
Thank you.

267
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,160
Thank you.

268
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:45,300
I'm actually so surprised because, like, when the movie came
out, people were not fanning over Gary the snake.

269
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:51,820
It was fucking Popper because Popper was, like, on
everyone's, like, radars.

270
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,120
Like, he had so much fucking merch made of him.

271
00:24:55,820 --> 00:25:03,600
Gary the snake it was crazy um so I'm very surprised that he
ended up getting popular uh because Utopia did not care

272
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:13,920
about him like they're like he is not merchandisable like oh
my god no I saw the avatar popcorn bucket and just I'm just

273
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:20,860
like how do you hold that like oh my god I need to show you
guys the avatar popcorn bucket because I was like I they had

274
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:28,640
the avatar popcorn bucket out and i was looking at it and i
was like bro that's cool that's like cool but also like that

275
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:39,680
is not holding a lot not only is it not holding a lot of
popcorn but like how the fuck do you hold i was so confused

276
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:52,520
um where is it oh i didn't bookmark it okay wait i thought i
did avatar popcorn bucket i saw there here you go like This

277
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,040
is not a lot of...

278
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,700
It's cool, I will say.

279
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:00,360
I'm not a fan of Avatar, Fire, and Ash.

280
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,300
No, of course, there's not a lot.

281
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,500
Do you know, okay, do you know the reason why Avatar the
Last Airbender, they have to put the Last Airbender down

282
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:06,720
there?

283
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:09,760
It's because James Cameron copyright trademarked Avatar.

284
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:15,080
So Avatar the Last Airbender cannot use anything with just
Avatar because of it.

285
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,060
They always have to have a little subtitle.

286
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:20,100
Or else James Cameron's gonna fucking get him.

287
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:31,580
blue avatar they trademark avatar first so they got to they
got to claim it um anyway but yeah no this is a like i was

288
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:41,200
like bro that's sick but also like that's not a lot of
popcorn i think that's like also like how to fuck the old

289
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:49,800
imagine holding this while you're watching a movie that's
like so obtrusive like it's not it is not comfortable at

290
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,320
yeah it's not comfortable or practical at all.

291
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,720
That's actually, like, what the fuck is that?

292
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,180
But it looks cool.

293
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,400
I will say it looks fucking cool.

294
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,120
It looks sick.

295
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,800
I still can't believe.

296
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:12,000
You can actually get the Avatar popcorn bucket, but you
can't get the Phanat one.

297
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,580
Joki, do you want the Phanat 2 Freddy Head popcorn bucket?

298
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:21,260
It's a Freddy Fast Bear Head as a popcorn bucket.

299
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,180
Yumi, thank you for that.

300
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:28,820
in the super chat thank you thank you how much is it oh my
god you get it on walmart okay at least like that's all

fuck how the fuck do you stick your hand looking at it bro

302
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:47,500

comfortable at all so what this what this dragoon is saying

303
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:56,840

this you can get it you can get it wherever you wherever in

304
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:05,980
retail because they're not like exclusive or anything at the
movie theaters but how the like yeah you can i guess that is

305
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:16,640

that hole for popcorn seems incredibly uncomfortable it does

306
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:23,900

the bottom of the freddy head well thank you for the super

mask is removed oh wait no the eyes love what the fuck how

do i wash this you can't even like you can't even dishwasher
it's Not even dishwash safe.

310
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,880
You hand wash this shit.

311
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,280
Because there's electronics.

312
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:53,640
There's fucking electronics in this fucking popcorn bucket.

313
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,340
Because the eyes light up.

314
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,460
Now is that the bite of 69?

315
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,520
Or...

316
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,940
You don't.

317
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,500
But it's for...

318
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,460
How am I supposed to wash a popcorn bucket?

319
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:12,080
Like it's one use only, apparently.

320
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:13,700
Don't...

321
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,920
Yeah, don't get...

322
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:29,200
don't use a popcorn bucket dokey you put it on display do
you know nothing about popcorn buckets dokey it's a

323
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:39,900
collector's item we don't spend 60 american dollars to use
something speaking of spending money um i heard the shit

324
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:46,080
about i don't know okay you guys might not know this about
anything about this because it's a luxury brand um But I

325
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,620
also didn't know anything about it.

326
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,600
But like, it popped up on my Twitter feed about Hermes.

327
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,720
What is it called?

328
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,900
Hermes Birkin bags.

329
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,160
And I was so apparently.

330
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:06,520
Okay, so the luxury item about these specific bags is that
it's very hard right now to get a Birkin bag.

331
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:13,200
And I was like, and like all the super rich people are
trying to get it right now.

332
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,160
But you have to be on a wait list.

333
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:22,440
and you have to purchase an X amount of bags to get onto the
waitlist.

334
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:33,540
So you have to purchase X amount of money equivalent to that
Birkin bag to get on the waitlist.

335
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,400
And the waitlist is like two years.

336
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:42,780
You have to wait like two plus years to even get your turn
to be called up on the waitlist.

337
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:49,620
So I was like, Okay, um, how expensive is a Birkin bag?

338
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,640
I looked it up.

339
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,660
$450,000.

340
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:56,820
It's

341
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,670
like, what the fuck?

342
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:07,870
I was just like, I don't, what?

343
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:13,950
I don't, but that's like, but the thing is, that's like the
middle ground.

344
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:28,230
That's, it, it ranges from 20, that's what Crocs, though
that's with crocodile skin a normal Birkin bag is like the

345
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:47,110
one that's like not as a bougie is like 30,000 dollars the
normal ones that aren't like crocodile skin $20,000 that's a

346
00:31:47,110 --> 00:32:03,400
freaking I know it's like $4,000 and pre-owned by the way I
need to let you guys know that is a pre-owned bag 20k for a

347
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:16,640
pre-owned bag yeah pre-owned and so I was like holy fuck
like this is manufactured scarcity too because they're

348
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:26,420
purposely making them so fucking rare so they can have make
them as expensive as they want because rich people are like

349
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:33,040
you know all the rich people's wives are like i must have it
it's the saddest simple if i don't have it all the other

350
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:40,140
wives are gonna make fun of me saying i'm not rich enough or
don't have enough power to be part of the group you know so

351
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:45,080
they're like i must have it so they get on the way or they
buy the pre-owned bag but like but apparently for buying

352
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:55,060
pre-owned bags is like a crime for them um they don't stoop
to that level apparently um i was like how long does to make

353
00:32:55,060 --> 00:33:10,840
a fucking bag like yeah they control the it's crazy um um
but the fact that there's a pre-spend requirement to even

354
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:20,260
like get on the fucking wait list you have to spend the
equivalent of a fuck the bag you want to be able to get on

355
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:31,940
that like waiting list like what the fuck do you buy yeah
the phenam the pre-requisite is crazy no i was watching this

356
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:38,920
video um like i was watching this one because i was like
this girl was like you can't do this like you have to get on

357
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:45,200
the way this and this guy was like i am willing to give you

359
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:59,040
equivalent of seven bags if i can get this bag for my wife
and she's like i'm sorry i'm sorry sir you have to get on

360
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:04,980
the wait list like it doesn't matter if you want to spend
money right now you have to get on the wait list and there's

361
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:13,180
a two-year wait right now like i'm really sorry he's like
please i will pay you in cash for seven bags and she's like

362
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:20,680

363
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:26,820

365
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:53,100

That's like the Hermie, Hermie situation right now.

366
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,680
Like, I know, right?

367
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:59,820
The man is like, I will buy seven bags worth of them.

368
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,580
I'll pay you in seven bags if I can get the Birkin bag.

369
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,780
That is actually true.

370
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:11,420
I didn't have, like, that's fucking wild.

371
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,080
Like, I'm like, why?

372
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,200
They just have, like, no time.

373
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,380
Like, they just are so fucking bored now.

374
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,280
I love this.

375
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:26,640
How can I waste the most money on the most worthless things?

376
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:32,440
I'll buy America to get this back.

377
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:39,060
We were lamenting about for that popcorn bucket being $350
right now.

378
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,920
And then these days, people are buying like 20, not even 20,
it has to be more expensive.

379
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:47,760
Because 20K is a pre-owned, it's not even that big.

380
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,260
I was like, okay, how big is this bag?

381
00:35:49,280 --> 00:36:00,040
like I was thinking like okay how big is a Birkin bag it's
not even it can't even hold a laptop why the fuck am I

382
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:12,180
spending 20 grand on a bag that can't even hold a goddamn
laptop like maybe an iPad I will say maybe it's not about

383
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:27,920
the size like yeah that bag it's a fucking small even why i
need about the function yeah i can't even hold a small how

384
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:43,560
would i fit a chihuahua in this bag how why is there a lock
that lock is not locking anything i will say i'm i think a

385
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:51,000
lock is actually um aesthetic because like it's not locking
anything it's just locking the piece of fabric for fucking

386
00:36:51,000 --> 00:37:00,480
no reason that lock better be made of goddamn diamond if
it's 20k pre-owned i think the real bag is like 50k or some

387
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:17,160
shit all right berkin bag price new all right let's see okay
35 grand okay all right yes 35 grand the bag is more

388
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:27,360
expensive than the But yeah, anyway, so that's really what I
want to talk about today, my rival's journey today, and also

389
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,360
what the fuck is up with Birkin bags?

390
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:37,980
Like, I think the craziest part was one of them being
$450,000.

391
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:38,860
I'll show you guys.

392
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,060
I was looking it up because I was like, how much are Birkin
bags anyway?

393
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:46,140
And then, like, literally the first result was a $450,000
bag.

394
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,320
And I was like, excuse me.

395
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,560
Excuse me.

396
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,440
Like, um, sir.

397
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,560
here, I'll link it to you.

398
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:03,700
Because I'll prove it to you that it's real.

399
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,960
It's very real.

400
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,760
Bro, like, bro, you can just buy a car.

401
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,980
Let's buy a fucking car.

402
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,660
Or a house.

403
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:30,940
holy shit i know i know me too me too buddy holy shit that's
a real bag

404
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:45,800
what is this i can't carry this bag can't even carry a car
it's because it's made of Himalaya Niloticus crocodile

405
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:55,420
diamond encrusted because the lock has a diamond in it oh my
god that's why it's so like for us if this lock better have

406
00:38:55,420 --> 00:39:06,580
diamonds it's because the lock actually has diamonds holy
shit wait let me show you that's crazy look you can see it

407
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:15,860
actually has diamonds right here like that's a pigeon toy
Your lock is a goddamn fidget toy right now.

408
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:21,410
Yeah, and then there's diamonds on this part.

409
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:29,040
You basically have your very own fidget toy on your bag.

410
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:33,160
Oh, so it wasn't a bit.

411
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,680
Yeah, that lock alone is 200k.

412
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:39,760
Okay.

413
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,060
All right, let's play Hades.

414
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,620
I don't know how long I'm going to play today.

415
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:49,160
I don't know, it could be long because I went from one
addiction to the other.

416
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:59,140
Yeah, no, for those who don't know this, I said this before,
but diamonds are like, they're man-made inflation or like

417
00:39:59,140 --> 00:39:59,960
man-made market.

418
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:06,540
So the only reason why they're so expensive is because
diamonds are monopolized by, I think like one or two

419
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:11,380
companies, and they are the ones that manufacture the prices
for diamonds.

420
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,260
But they're actually very common.

421
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,640
They're actually incredibly common.

422
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,240
But they're the ones that control the market.

423
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,280
So they can make it that expensive.

424
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,140
There shouldn't be that expensive.

425
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,400
It's just controlled by the market.

426
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:34,880
Alright.

427
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:35,740
Let's see.

428
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:50,820
all right so for those who are confused we did an extra
night during rivals so we uh we skipped you are missing one

429
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:59,540
night of gameplay more worth to seal off that the valuables
did the valuables inside damn you rich people thank you for

430
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:06,620
the super chat solid thank you thank you yeah and then For
those who didn't watch the rival stream, because I did one

431
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:09,140
run, I had to wait two hours for the first game.

432
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,620
So I was like, fuck it, let's just do a run.

433
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:15,780
And because I did one run, I decided to do a free will run
where I decide what to pick.

434
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,380
And then we ended up doing a magic build.

435
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,380
And it might have been the worst build I've ever done.

436
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,800
So we are no longer practicing free will.

437
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:29,600
We are no longer practicing free will after that.

438
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,500
That had to be the worst run I've ever done.

439
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:33,820
Oh, what's that?

440
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:35,300
Disgusting.

441
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,080
Oh, shit.

442
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:36,940
Free stuff.

443
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,300
I'm still picking it up.

444
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:44,320
So what's been going on with you and Kronos anyway?

445
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,720
You keep beating him, but he keeps coming back.

446
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,160
I like how pointless it seems, but there has to be more to
it, right?

447
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,300
Come on, Eris.

448
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,440
I'm not about to reveal the critical details of my...

449
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,600
Try thinking once, and I hated it.

450
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:01,800
What's the point of being a streamer if I have to think for
myself?

451
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,820
Oh, there's a bitch.

452
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,820
Are you planning to use his own powers against him?

453
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,200
Break free, our family members one by one.

454
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,320
Anything like that?

455
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:13,920
She must hate her family if she's trying to stop me.

456
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,380
Not telling you.

457
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:16,060
Hmm.

458
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:17,740
Alright.

459
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,700
Boo free will.

460
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,960
You prevailed in your attempt.

461
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:26,900
But our enemy is time itself.

462
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:28,280
She's nice.

463
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,440
No, she is not.

464
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:30,820
She's fake as fuck.

465
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:39,920
and as yet i often fought back feelings that this task would
be impossible i am her auntie she's my auntie first though

466
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:49,640
we're anteing each other ability tends to be transient time
would wear us down but with patience we can withstand you

467
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:58,220
cannot fix there are some people that are not meant to be
fixed and she is one of them patience never give her another

468
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:05,020
chance oh hey summon a colony of bats may use in cages to
better orient yourself.

469
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:08,360
Oh my god, let's say that I want a fucking army of bats.

470
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,120
Like, that sounds fun.

471
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,440
Oh, I just need two more runs for the sand.

472
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:13,880
I might just do that.

473
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,020
We'll just get a rabbit everything.

474
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,120
Don't fuck that.

475
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,100
We'll do get...

476
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:23,640
Let's just do two runs of the grandpa run real quick, too.

477
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:29,580
And then we'll finish the down... We'll finish the um... The
hell run.

478
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,780
Yes, Lord Carol.

479
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:36,200
You'll have what gold I may find as I require what supplies
you may spare.

480
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:37,080
Hmm.

481
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:38,980
All right.

482
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:40,080
Let's see.

483
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:40,700
Oh, hey, nice.

484
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,320
More psyche.

485
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:43,260
We need that.

486
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:47,640
Um, well, need...

487
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,700
Actually, I don't need to spend stuff yet.

488
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:54,800
The unhappy goddess of Kamubans casts a judging gaze on all
within the crossroads.

489
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,120
Why need more than two?

490
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:57,040
How many do I need?

491
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:58,100
End of spite.

492
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,780
Don't want to get on them's bad side.

493
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,620
A nemesis, about the dream I had.

494
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:10,080
Kronos, he... demanded that my father tell him where the
fates reside.

495
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:12,560
Smart.

496
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:15,100
Mother Nix never would have told him.

497
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:19,480
The fates may be my sisters, but even I have no idea where
they are.

498
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:23,280
Long as they're hidden, no one can mess with their designs.

499
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:30,720
You don't sound especially concerned that Kronos apparently
found the Three Weavers of Destiny and may be forcing their

500
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,700
plans for the future.

501
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:33,940
Really?

502
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,020
Did I ever give you the impression I had any hope this would
end well?

503
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:40,720
Alright.

504
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:41,660
How did he have found them?

505
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:42,840
Oh yeah!

506
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,160
Where did Fates know?

507
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,720
Can they just see the future?

508
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:47,680
They're always weaving.

509
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,200
That means even they know only so much in advance.

510
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:52,820
Wait, time moves faster than fate?

511
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:56,880
Time moves faster than expected.

512
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:59,380
Have they ever thought to maybe be faster?

513
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:01,780
I mean, 20 seconds.

00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:13,600

Oh, shit.

531
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:17,520
Okay, I'll do one run.

532
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,540
I don't think I've done the axe yet.

533
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:23,540
Yeah, I'm a sap abuser.

534
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:28,900
But now I've joined in our Princess Melinawee's most
righteous cause.

535
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,760
Welcome to the ranks of the unseen.

536
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,780
What build would be good with an axe?

537
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:35,140
I'm not doing this yet.

538
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:36,760
I don't think I need to.

539
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:40,300
Because I don't have, like, needed to upgrade my weapons
yet.

540
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:42,920
Oh, what?

541
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,140
The family is united in our course.

542
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:45,840
In the name of Hades.

543
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,800
Olympus, I accept this message.

544
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:49,620
Wait, this is new.

545
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:53,600
Hello?

546
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:54,740
Hera?

547
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,200
I already had enough of a surface.

548
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:57,540
Yes.

549
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:02,020
Well, I promised the family that once you demonstrated your
resolve to us, I'd take care of you.

550
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:12,680
you under my wing and i always keep my vows what your
special seal mark damage and inflict hitch your cast inflict

551
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:19,680
hitch and immediately deal damage based on foes in the
blinding circle like if flows take 30 of damage dealt to

552
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:26,140
other afflicted flows your sprint inflicts hitch on
surrounding and deals damage when it does what the fuck is

553
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:35,160
hitch take 30 delta utter afflicted flows oh Oh, so it,
like, it, like, builds the damage together.

554
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,480
Wait, which was the best, guys?

555
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,540
Yeah, it shared damage.

556
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:41,280
I was thinking, yeah.

557
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:42,580
It's chain.

558
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,380
Sprint is good on Hera.

559
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,480
All right, we'll try to sprint.

560
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:48,560
Her majesty, the queen, is with me now.

561
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:50,460
Okay.

562
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:53,200
Oh, my God.

563
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,100
It's so slow.

564
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,060
I'm not used to it.

565
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:57,320
It's so fucking slow.

566
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:57,680
Okay.

567
00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:58,840
Fishing time.

568
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:03,930
Come on.

569
00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:05,470
Mad.

570
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:06,930
There you go.

571
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:07,430
Yeah!

572
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:09,310
We got a figment!

573
00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:10,990
I don't know what that is.

574
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:13,770
Whatever that is.

575
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:16,750
There.

576
00:49:17,870 --> 00:49:18,210
Boom!

577
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:22,570
It's like a combo, too.

578
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:26,830
All right, 50.

579
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:30,910
We'll get... We'll get Hermes in here.

580
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:36,590
Also, another reason why I'm like, oh, wait, I remember
Hera.

581
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:38,330
I was literally watching Crapopolis.

582
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:44,210
For those who don't know what Crapopolis is, it's another
animation show by Dan Harmon.

583
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:49,490
And I really like it because I also love, like, you know, I
love mythology in general.

584
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:51,590
And I like Dan Harmon's stuff.

585
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:54,150
I really like Dan Harmon shows.

586
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:57,990
But I was actually watching an episode like today.

587
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:00,230
Crapopolis starts with a K.

588
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:04,250
Yeah, it was originally an NFP.

589
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:11,730
They originally made the show for NFTs and then And then NFT
market fell and then they're like, wait, this show is

590
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:14,150
actually pretty People are actually liking this show.

591
00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:22,090
I guess we could keep going like Yeah, the original intent
was for it to sell NFTs, but then like People actually liked

592
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:25,750
the show so they're like, oh, okay, let's just keep making
it

593
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:42,140
It's a good show And another item appears afterwards what
does that mean like uh when you're slave oh deal more damage

594
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:52,320
with your weapon for the next 45 seconds oh shouldn't mean
streak be better three early is good is suffering from

595
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:59,480
success well the nfts failed though uh the nfts failed

596
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:07,780
so they pit they just pivoted because they're like oh okay
we can Just do that, I guess.

597
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:13,060
Can you remember you used my cast for this?

598
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,400
Feels a bit slow.

599
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:20,020
Oh, wait.

600
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:21,380

How exactly you shall vanquish Kronos?

623
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:53,520
Someone shall have to explain to me at some point.

624
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:56,820
Your witching ways shall help you to prevail will be...

625
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:57,420
Not, hmm?

626
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,440
At least he hasn't yet imprisoned you along with your kin.

627
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:02,120
Yeah.

628
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:03,140
I got out.

629
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:05,520
Don't have my arm no more, but I got out.

630
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,100
Right on.

631
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:08,020
Anisha counter.

632
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,240
I feel like two, right?

633
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:12,240
We would lose magic, though.

634
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:20,810
2, right?

635
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:22,170
But it does prime...

636
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:24,130
No issues at Prime's 50.

637
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:26,130
Ugh.

638
00:53:27,590 --> 00:53:29,250

639
00:53:31,450 --> 00:53:31,930
Oh, hey.

00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,730

00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:27,410
Core previews.

00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:29,170
After you, it's 50% less.

00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:30,230
After it's 65.

654
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:31,480
Too much chance to find.

655
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:35,350
Resources for next.

656
00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:36,770
Boons have a chance.

657
00:54:39,470 --> 00:54:41,490

660
00:54:44,470 --> 00:54:46,290

They're both H.

678
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:38,790
I got confused.

679
00:55:39,150 --> 00:55:41,310
Why are all the gods' names starts with H?

680
00:55:42,450 --> 00:55:43,510
Alright, we'll do Hef.

681
00:55:45,170 --> 00:55:45,550

Jesus Christ.

687
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:07,080

00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:10,060
Okay.

689
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:11,980
It's just so slow.

690
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:13,460
I will have to admit.

691
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:17,180

Okay.

710
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:22,920

01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:14,700
I could have had it in her pet.

768
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,200
It just calls at me.

01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:20,480

He doesn't care.

783
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:05,760
As long as he gets money.

784
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:07,080
Oh, nice.

785
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:08,140

Good.

I had 400.

788
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:14,620
I'm broke now.

789
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:18,800
Our enemy surely is beginning to wonder how you are able to
thwart him.

790
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:20,220
Get that bag.

791
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:20,780
Exactly.

792
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:22,940
The less he knows of us.

793
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,620
He's all about capitalism.

794
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:28,920
Krono seems to think my family bond with him is why I'm able
to resist.

795
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:32,160
He hasn't made the connection that you're the one who's
prepared me.

796
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:36,060
Gotta do my SATs again.

797
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:37,320
My PSATs.

798
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:39,360
This is an internal PSAT.

799
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:43,420
Eternal PSAT test.

800
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:47,300
That's actually...

801
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:50,600
Oh my god, I almost forgot how to fucking kill this girl.

802
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,280
Okay, nice.

803
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:03,990
Sisters!

804
01:02:05,630 --> 01:02:06,350
Got you!

805
01:02:06,830 --> 01:02:07,390
Oh, hey, plants.

806
01:02:08,790 --> 01:02:12,030
I'm like, oh, but there's a plant over there, though.

807
01:02:12,790 --> 01:02:13,410
Oh, shit!

808
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:16,960
Oh, shit!

809
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:18,120
Oh, God.

810
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:19,300
Okay.

811
01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:23,370
Oh, God.

812
01:02:24,890 --> 01:02:25,270
Okay.

813
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:27,970
Yay!

814
01:02:29,590 --> 01:02:31,910
I thought that was so unintentional.

815
01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:35,730
I mean to do that, but I'll take it.

816
01:02:41,530 --> 01:02:41,770
Okay.

817
01:02:46,890 --> 01:02:47,770
Oh, God.

818
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:53,020
Ah!

819
01:02:53,420 --> 01:02:54,020
Oh, my God.

820
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:55,440
That's so much damage.

821
01:02:58,340 --> 01:03:00,380
How come the frog didn't get turned into a shield?

822
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:01,220
That's not fair.

823
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:03,760
It's not an inconvenience, but a strength.

824
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:07,540
How did the frog not get turned?

825
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:08,880
Can you go?

826
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:10,020
Oh.

827
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:11,600
Oh, hey.

828
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:13,100
That shade needs you, Freenos.

829
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:14,720
Come back.

830
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:16,660
Come back to hell.

831
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,000
We'll miss you.

832
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:20,260
Spin until we win.

833
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:21,240
Oh, win.

834
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:21,520
Sorry.

835
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:22,620
We win.

836
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:23,860
Again.

837
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:24,900
Can I gift you?

838
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:28,620
Oh, why can't I give Grandpa something?

839
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:31,440
Is your next boon you find in Clues?

840
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:32,540
Oh, yeah, we'll grab that.

841
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:34,300
Oh, no.

842
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:35,140
We don't need that.

843
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:40,180
We'll need...

844
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:41,380
Which one was it?

845
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:42,920
Oh, yeah, we'll need this.

846
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:46,200
And then...

847
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:49,460
Why are you so cranky?

848
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:51,000
I'm literally going to give you a free shit.

849
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:58,100
That's it?

850
01:03:58,260 --> 01:03:58,860
You just don't...

851
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:00,320
Yeah, he's like, I just want to gossip.

852
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:04,720
He's just here to gossip with me.

853
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:06,760
He's like, bro, fuck my son.

854
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:08,080
And I'm like, yeah, I know, right?

855
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:09,700
Zeus is such an asshole.

856
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:12,560
That's cold.

857
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:19,060
Just want someone to talk to you.

858
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:20,820
Isn't that sad?

859
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:26,200
The only issue with this one is just the...

860
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:29,200
I think like the...

861
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:32,620
It's very annoying fighting these guys.

862
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:34,700
Only because that...

863
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:38,200
It doesn't like stop him.

864
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:40,120
Okay, spoon.

865
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:41,240
heart.

866
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:43,040
Okay, palm tab.

867
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:44,340
I think you get palm, right?

868
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:44,920
Yeah, palm.

869
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:46,600
I don't need health yet.

870
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:47,600
I just need stronger.

871
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:50,260
Oh, shit.

872
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:50,920
Spin!

873
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:53,520
Can't block this!

874
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:56,080
Oh, wait, that's fast.

875
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:57,660
Oh, okay.

876
01:04:57,820 --> 01:04:59,100
Your attacks can deal.

877
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:00,760
Ooh, one, right?

878
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:03,960
I'll do one.

879
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:06,180
I'm scared.

880
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:06,840
My free will.

881
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:07,400
I'm scared.

882
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:08,520

Mouse one.

884
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:12,960
Dash onto the enemy attack gets cancelled if you dash again.

885
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:13,380
Oh!

886
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:15,320
I didn't know you could do that.

887
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:16,540
Always a treat.

888
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:18,640
I'm always scared to enact free will.

889
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:23,700
Oh, we'll grab this real quick.

890
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:28,740
Oh.

891
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:31,460
That is, it's just one guy?

892
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:34,380
Wait, what the fuck?

893
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:35,400
Okay, give me that money.

894
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:36,540

01:10:46,210 --> 01:10:47,890
That was a lot of damage.

987
01:10:49,050 --> 01:10:51,790
But I also got a lot of damage on me.

988
01:10:52,730 --> 01:10:54,510
Okay, I need health really badly.

989
01:10:57,350 --> 01:10:58,010
Oh my god.

990
01:10:58,070 --> 01:10:58,230
Three.

991
01:10:58,250 --> 01:10:58,410
Wait.

992
01:10:58,770 --> 01:11:01,330
Attack fires around you, leaving free to move and strike.

993
01:11:03,890 --> 01:11:06,850
The final move attack sequence hit two times, but use...

994
01:11:06,850 --> 01:11:07,670
Okay, three.

995
01:11:08,110 --> 01:11:09,290
That has to be three.

996
01:11:10,230 --> 01:11:11,510
One is spin to win.

997
01:11:11,610 --> 01:11:12,710
Oh, one is good.

998
01:11:16,290 --> 01:11:18,970
I feel like I can attack faster, though.

999
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:23,790
Oh, this is hard.

1000
01:11:24,550 --> 01:11:25,650
Okay, I'm going to like three more.

1001
01:11:25,770 --> 01:11:25,990
Okay.

1002
01:11:27,470 --> 01:11:28,890
Oh, this is a lot faster.

1003
01:11:28,970 --> 01:11:29,990
Yeah, I definitely like it.

1004
01:11:30,390 --> 01:11:31,650
It is a lot faster.

1005
01:11:32,770 --> 01:11:34,490
Uh, we'll get ash.

1006
01:11:38,830 --> 01:11:39,370
Spin!

1007
01:11:41,230 --> 01:11:41,880
There we go.

1008
01:11:43,550 --> 01:11:44,010
Spin!

1009
01:11:46,130 --> 01:11:46,670
Okay.

1010
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:49,110
Oh, god.

1011
01:11:50,290 --> 01:11:50,750
Oh, god.

1012
01:11:57,010 --> 01:11:58,090
There we go.

1013
01:12:00,530 --> 01:12:01,070
Nice.

1014
01:12:02,130 --> 01:12:02,750
Ash time.

1015
01:12:02,930 --> 01:12:04,210
And I got a flower, too.

1016
01:12:05,550 --> 01:12:06,090
I have enough?

1017
01:12:06,170 --> 01:12:06,630
I do.

1018
01:12:06,770 --> 01:12:07,870
I have enough for the shop.

1019
01:12:09,910 --> 01:12:12,190
Oh, let it rip.

1020
01:12:12,490 --> 01:12:13,450
Oh, hey, fish tab.

1021
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:15,870
Here, little fish.

1022
01:12:16,690 --> 01:12:18,230
Here, little fishy fishy.

1023
01:12:19,150 --> 01:12:19,890
Oh, no escape.

1024
01:12:20,150 --> 01:12:20,590
Yay!

1025
01:12:22,570 --> 01:12:23,470
What's that?

1026
01:12:25,370 --> 01:12:28,330
Okay, your blast effects also like glow.

1027
01:12:28,850 --> 01:12:30,130
Oh, more damage.

1028
01:12:30,730 --> 01:12:33,990
Game bonus based on your prime limit.

1029
01:12:35,770 --> 01:12:36,170
Hmm.

1030
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:37,590
Two?

1031
01:12:37,970 --> 01:12:38,270
Two?

1032
01:12:38,970 --> 01:12:39,270
Two.

1033
01:12:39,330 --> 01:12:39,670
Okay.

1034
01:12:42,110 --> 01:12:43,190
Oh, I have more damage.

1035
01:12:43,450 --> 01:12:43,710
Yeah, glow.

1036
01:12:44,790 --> 01:12:45,290
Oh, shit.

1037
01:12:45,370 --> 01:12:46,430
Okay, I can't afford that.

1038
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:48,690
I can't buy both of this, though.

1039
01:12:50,290 --> 01:12:50,670
Yeah.

1040
01:12:51,070 --> 01:12:52,730
I can't afford the other one.

1041
01:12:53,810 --> 01:12:54,090
Alright.

1042
01:12:56,350 --> 01:12:57,370
Time to be a hater.

1043
01:12:57,590 --> 01:12:57,990
Yay!

1044
01:13:01,070 --> 01:13:03,130
Don't you have any new material yet to get out?

1045
01:13:03,130 --> 01:13:06,110
Yeah, you've been saying the same song over and over, bro.

1046
01:13:06,650 --> 01:13:07,870
You're a one-hit wonder.

1047
01:13:08,690 --> 01:13:09,310
Shut up.

1048
01:13:09,330 --> 01:13:10,850
That's right, I said it.

1049
01:13:16,210 --> 01:13:19,570
I mean, you've been singing one song this entire time.

1050
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:23,490
Not only I call her Wash, I call her a one-hit wonder.

1051
01:13:23,990 --> 01:13:26,570
She's like that guy who sang something I used to know.

1052
01:13:26,850 --> 01:13:28,850
He literally made one song and then disappeared.

1053
01:13:34,830 --> 01:13:37,430
Um, not, you mean greatest hit?

1054
01:13:42,890 --> 01:13:45,010
What do you mean?

1055
01:13:45,410 --> 01:13:47,030
Greatest hits.

1056
01:13:49,610 --> 01:13:50,790
Oh, God.

1057
01:13:53,850 --> 01:13:54,070
Okay.

1058
01:13:54,870 --> 01:13:57,150
Oh, my God.

1059
01:13:57,470 --> 01:13:57,890
Okay, it's fine.

1060
01:14:02,290 --> 01:14:02,670
Oh, wait.

1061
01:14:02,690 --> 01:14:03,690
I already got him.

1062
01:14:05,730 --> 01:14:06,290
Whoa!

1063
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:10,500
Nice.

1064
01:14:11,060 --> 01:14:11,520
Nice.

1065
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:17,220
Oh shit, oh shit!

1066
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:20,700
That's a lot of explosions, guys!

1067
01:14:21,420 --> 01:14:22,740
I was not expecting that.

1068
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:23,660
Oh, fuck!

1069
01:14:24,020 --> 01:14:24,660
Not again!

1070
01:14:25,740 --> 01:14:27,280
Okay, I gotta get her out of here.

1071
01:14:30,660 --> 01:14:30,920
Okay.

1072
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:35,480
Okay.

1073
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:37,680
Just her left.

1074
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:41,940
Alright, nice.

1075
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:46,820
I definitely need mana, I know.

1076
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:54,220
Oh, that was a lot of damage.

1077
01:14:55,820 --> 01:14:56,620
Because I'm a tank.

1078
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:58,200
I'm a goddamn tank.

1079
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:03,100
Let her reach the chorus.

1080
01:15:03,860 --> 01:15:04,100
No.

1081
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:06,200
No.

1082
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:08,780
Yeah.

1083
01:15:09,980 --> 01:15:10,920

1084
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:12,180
Oh, I'm broke, broke.

01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:13,340

Yeah, I missed the tree.

Uh, you do more damage so that I know when your other foes
gain chance to dodge, which double against scorched

1097
01:17:02,150 --> 01:17:03,590
afflicted enemies.

1098

Mmm...

1099
01:17:06,390 --> 01:17:07,890
It's only 5% though.

1100
01:17:09,170 --> 01:17:11,150
I guess we could do snuff candle for a boss fight.

1101
01:17:11,310 --> 01:17:11,530
Yeah.

1102
01:17:12,090 --> 01:17:12,710
Boss fight.

1103
01:17:15,390 --> 01:17:16,590
Where is the tree?

1104
01:17:16,670 --> 01:17:17,350
Oh, there it is.

1112
01:17:36,570 --> 01:17:37,010
Alright.

1113
01:17:38,450 --> 01:17:39,130
That's right.

01:17:39,370 --> 01:17:39,790
Spin!

Oh, never mind.

1118
01:17:46,890 --> 01:17:48,030
You're still alive?

Oh, your special strikes further and deals 150.

1120

Your speech hit deals plus 300 damage to armor.

1121
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:01,960
Your dash strikes.

1122
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:04,700
Ah.

1123
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:08,520
Um, I actually don't know.

1124
01:18:09,220 --> 01:18:11,740
I don't know if I use a three.

1125
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:14,380
Three is good.

1126
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:17,460
Is three that good?

1127
01:18:20,180 --> 01:18:21,280

01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:55,760
Who the fuck took the $6 from the chest?

1132
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:01,020
Oh, God.

1133
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:01,860
No, not her.

1134
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:06,380
Oh, I'm so bad against this one.

1135
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:10,720
Spin!

1136
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:11,500
Oh, fuck.

1137
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:12,180
Okay, never mind.

1138
01:19:12,260 --> 01:19:12,880
Maybe not spin.

1139
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:14,000
Maybe not.

1140
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:17,800
Jesus Christ.

1141
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:18,980
She does so much.

1142
01:19:19,940 --> 01:19:22,000
She has so much HP, too.

1143
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:22,800
That's the worst part.

1144
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:25,660
She does so much and has so much HP.

1145
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:33,180
the dead are as innumerable as the sprigs of wheat within
the morning fields but do not make for the most satisfying

1146
01:19:33,180 --> 01:19:42,340
sustenance for the unspeakable monstrosities therein she
heals are you serious that's why oh my god that's why she's

01:21:06,270 --> 01:21:07,390
Yeah, what this time?

1166
01:21:08,210 --> 01:21:08,530
Yeah.

1167
01:21:10,370 --> 01:21:10,610
Oh.

1168
01:21:11,050 --> 01:21:11,530
Oh.

1169
01:21:13,010 --> 01:21:14,370
What does she have?

1170
01:21:15,070 --> 01:21:15,630
Oh, okay.

1171
01:21:15,770 --> 01:21:17,090
Come with me if you want to live.

1172
01:21:17,190 --> 01:21:18,970
Well, you're dead technically, but...

1173
01:21:19,650 --> 01:21:22,410
If you want a nicer place to live while you're dead.

1174
01:21:25,470 --> 01:21:25,870
Oh, nice.

1175
01:21:25,990 --> 01:21:26,290
Flower.

1176
01:21:27,890 --> 01:21:28,370
Oh.

1177
01:21:29,430 --> 01:21:30,270
Which one?

1178
01:21:30,650 --> 01:21:32,270
We don't really have the moon yet.

1179
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:33,650
We'll grab...

1180
01:21:34,350 --> 01:21:35,490
I guess we'll get...

1181
01:21:35,490 --> 01:21:37,670
We don't have any moon powers, so...

1182
01:21:37,670 --> 01:21:39,190
I feel like I should kill here.

1183
01:21:39,970 --> 01:21:40,270
Hera?

1184
01:21:40,610 --> 01:21:41,270
Oh, too late.

1185
01:21:43,450 --> 01:21:43,990
Too late.

1186
01:21:44,090 --> 01:21:44,690
Here they come.

1187
01:21:45,870 --> 01:21:49,090
Look, it's because I thought, like, oh, we don't have any
moon powers.

1188
01:21:49,210 --> 01:21:50,590
Like, that's my initial thought.

1189
01:21:55,900 --> 01:21:58,160
Does it count if I have, like...

1190
01:21:58,620 --> 01:21:59,060
Um...

1191
01:22:00,660 --> 01:22:03,900
Wait, I can get more damage, too, if you think about it.

1192
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:06,820
Curse you, free will.

1193
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:09,920
Free will has betrayed me yet again.

1194
01:22:12,780 --> 01:22:14,780
Alright, grab health, too.

1195
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:18,480
I messed up by listening to free will.

1196
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:22,880
Oh, there's a lot of items here.

1197
01:22:27,740 --> 01:22:31,040
Alright, uh, where the fuck are the trees, though.

1198
01:22:34,180 --> 01:22:35,720
It was like money.

1199
01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:37,080
It was moons and herm.

1200
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:37,560
Oh, there you go.

1201
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:38,900
We'll grab moon first.

1202
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:39,980
Oh, there you go.

1203
01:22:40,380 --> 01:22:40,400
Nice.

1204
01:22:40,580 --> 01:22:41,260
There's a tree.

1205
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:43,340
I should need this.

1206
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:45,600
There you go.

1207
01:22:46,020 --> 01:22:47,620
We'll grab moon power first.

1208
01:22:53,610 --> 01:22:54,210
Oh, God.

1209
01:22:54,370 --> 01:22:54,910
That's depressing.

1210
01:22:56,370 --> 01:22:59,050
What do you mean you have your you have the witch?

1211
01:22:59,490 --> 01:22:59,490
Ooh.

1212
01:23:00,410 --> 01:23:01,210
I mean, that's good.

1213
01:23:01,470 --> 01:23:02,210
I actually needed that.

1214
01:23:02,890 --> 01:23:03,650
I needed the hit.

1215
01:23:03,670 --> 01:23:05,670
so I can regen my magic.

1216
01:23:07,770 --> 01:23:09,670
There you go.

1217
01:23:11,150 --> 01:23:12,030
Moon time!

1218
01:23:12,470 --> 01:23:13,710
Shine for me again tonight.

1219
01:23:15,270 --> 01:23:16,190
Death to Kronos.

1220
01:23:16,990 --> 01:23:21,910
I sense that you are growing closer to manifesting the
reality that we have long since sought.

1221
01:23:22,770 --> 01:23:25,570
May you yet drain whatever light is left in here.

1222
01:23:25,610 --> 01:23:28,650
Okay, that's another 5% damage too, if I get herself.

1223
01:23:29,410 --> 01:23:30,490
Makes everything else moves.

1224
01:23:30,650 --> 01:23:30,990
Ooh!

1225
01:23:31,450 --> 01:23:33,650
Your hex fires a beam that deals up your hand.

1226
01:23:33,670 --> 01:23:41,490
deals a large area target for a thousand damage after four
seconds oh Yeah, it's not healing though.

1227
01:23:41,510 --> 01:23:43,330

Do you guys hear about the news about like, apparently a
female esport player for like a mobile game got kicked out

That she did it on land, too.

1253
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:50,560
After your foe's struck, your chain law deals more damage
and mouses up to three times.

1254
01:26:53,060 --> 01:26:54,320
Oh, one or three?

1255
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:55,920
One?

1256
01:26:59,740 --> 01:27:02,760
Okay, that's more stuff for casting, you're right.

1257
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:03,940
Can I afford this?

1258
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,100
Oh, I can, but then I won't be able to afford food.

1259
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:09,040
Do I need food?

1260
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:16,940
Hmm, am I that hungry though?

That's insane.

1277
01:28:19,620 --> 01:28:23,840

No, oh my god.

1290
01:30:04,110 --> 01:30:04,710
Okay.

You are just act not safe.

1293
01:30:13,990 --> 01:30:17,150
I didn't think he would run at me.

1294
01:30:17,970 --> 01:30:19,390
That Esport Lady was smurfing.

1295
01:30:19,630 --> 01:30:22,630
No, you are not safe in that spot.

1296
01:30:23,590 --> 01:30:24,770
Okay, this is awkward.

1297
01:30:25,870 --> 01:30:28,630
I don't know if I'll make it to the end now, guys.

1298
01:30:28,830 --> 01:30:31,030
I have a bad feeling.

1299
01:30:36,980 --> 01:30:39,840
Guys, I have a feeling I might not make it to the end.

1300
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:47,060
So Briss might have, may or may not have took two of my, two
of my death defiance cast.

1301
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:50,920
It's not looking too good for me now.

1302
01:30:53,960 --> 01:30:56,440
101 HP is a lot of HP.

1303
01:30:58,320 --> 01:30:58,740
Okay.

1304
01:31:02,900 --> 01:31:05,020

1308
01:31:40,380 --> 01:31:42,000
earth We're once criminal.

1309
01:31:42,380 --> 01:31:46,820
I can't believe that this is Tartarus I think I'm just not
good with the axe.

1310
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,140
I tank it too much

1311
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:08,560
No, it's because like I I keep oh my god I keep fucking
Instead of dodging I just tank it because I feel I'm like

1312
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:12,920
I'm so strong guys I can just tank this But I was not so
strong.

1313
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:15,260
In the end.

1314
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:17,700
Apparently I was not that strong.

1315
01:32:22,060 --> 01:32:24,700
I keep thinking I'm like unstoppable.

1316
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:27,140
But I can be stopped.

1317
01:32:27,300 --> 01:32:28,120
That's crazy.

1318
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:30,820
What do you mean I can be stopped?

1319
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:34,000
What is this bullshit?

1320
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:36,740
She has she in fact.

1321
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:39,320
I cannot take those apparently.

1322
01:32:43,020 --> 01:32:43,460
Spin!

1323
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:46,300
There you go.

1324
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:47,480
Oh, what the fuck?

1325
01:32:47,620 --> 01:32:48,260
You're still alive?

1326
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:50,780
Oh, shit!

1327
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:56,040
Okay, there you go.

1328
01:32:57,300 --> 01:32:57,740
That was unlucky.

1329
01:32:58,160 --> 01:32:59,020
I tanked it again.

1330
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:01,100
Alright.

1331
01:33:02,360 --> 01:33:03,800
Your attacks can cause blasts.

1332
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:05,280
Your cast for Poolean like scorch.

1333
01:33:05,420 --> 01:33:06,940
You deal more damage on foes.

1334
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:07,940

01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:10,320
Three would be good for Kronos.

1337
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:12,680
One, right?

1338
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:13,780

Oh, God.

1343
01:33:48,420 --> 01:33:49,980
I don't even know what's hitting me.

1344
01:33:52,260 --> 01:33:52,700
Okay.

1345
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:54,680
I got confused.

1346
01:33:55,400 --> 01:33:57,580
There's just so many things going on on my screen.

1347
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:01,320
Oh, God.

1348
01:34:01,540 --> 01:34:02,060
That's so...

1349
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:06,620
That was an accident.

1350
01:34:07,780 --> 01:34:09,320
That is an accident.

1351
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:11,060
I don't mean to get hit there.

1352
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:15,180
Oh, God.

01:34:18,120 --> 01:34:19,480

1354
01:34:20,780 --> 01:34:22,260
I got too confident.

1355
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:26,280
Oh, I don't have a lot of money, are they?

1356
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:29,360

of the underworld not just for its softness But because it

1384
01:36:10,180 --> 01:36:15,380
was favored by his titan father a stark reminder of a
bygone.

1385
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:16,180

I wait to stop Kronos.

1397
01:36:36,340 --> 01:36:37,060
Hello, papa.

1398
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:38,480
Forever.

1399
01:36:39,480 --> 01:36:42,580
Even when my brothers foster sisters and I vanquished him.

1400
01:36:43,060 --> 01:36:43,880
Yeah, because they're weak.

1401
01:36:44,380 --> 01:36:44,940
Eventually be back.

1402
01:36:45,860 --> 01:36:46,440
But deathless.

1403
01:36:46,440 --> 01:36:46,980
I'm different.

1404
01:36:47,060 --> 01:36:47,980
I'm not like other gods.

1405
01:36:48,540 --> 01:36:50,240
It would be on our terms.

1406
01:36:51,080 --> 01:36:55,500
We were such fools What else could you have done?

1407
01:36:56,060 --> 01:37:03,380
He left you with no choice and you lacked the means to
destroy him utterly It was for the best that we lacked such

1408
01:37:03,380 --> 01:37:06,980
means We would have used them and continued using them.

1409
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:18,240
I merely judged the dead or used to I was never fit to judge
the living All right, restore health for one percent till

1410
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:18,460
you reach?

1411
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:19,380
reach the limit.

1412
01:37:19,780 --> 01:37:20,960
Oh, wait, that one.

1413
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:23,960
Okay, sometimes you use...

1414
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:27,880
Oh, shit, wait, two.

1415
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:33,480
Oh, wait, but I get plus, guys, plus 20% more damage,

1416
01:37:34,580 --> 01:37:37,380
But... I did use two, though.

1417
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:41,940
Two is even more glass.

1418
01:37:42,460 --> 01:37:45,600
Guys, but more damage, though.

1419
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:46,180

Tokey, don't listen.

1431
01:38:16,280 --> 01:38:18,460

Now I can afford everything.

1461
01:41:28,310 --> 01:41:29,490
Three first, too late.

1462
01:41:30,510 --> 01:41:32,170
I should have done three first, though.

1463
01:41:32,450 --> 01:41:33,250
No, you guys were right.

1464
01:41:33,390 --> 01:41:34,590
I should have done it first.

1465
01:41:34,970 --> 01:41:36,470
But I can, it's okay, I can afford everything.

1466
01:41:38,870 --> 01:41:41,110
Too late, she took it.

1467

01:41:43,030 --> 01:41:45,350
Three, four, five.

1470
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:50,720
Oh, shit.

1471
01:41:50,860 --> 01:41:52,120
Okay, I don't know math.

1472
01:41:52,620 --> 01:41:54,580
Three, five hundred and sixty.

1473
01:41:57,400 --> 01:41:58,440
And then...

1474
01:41:58,440 --> 01:42:00,000
I'm not getting the card, guys.

1475
01:42:00,040 --> 01:42:01,060
It's not that worth it.

1476
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:04,060
Do I get Hermes or do I get the Palm?

1477
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:08,420
Oh, wait.

1478
01:42:08,580 --> 01:42:08,880
Yeah.

1479
01:42:10,540 --> 01:42:11,320
Do I get...

1480
01:42:11,320 --> 01:42:11,440
Do I get...

1481
01:42:11,460 --> 01:42:12,760
I don't need armor, right?

1482
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:13,580
I don't need armor.

1483
01:42:13,740 --> 01:42:14,840
I'll grab the cup palm first.

1484
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:20,620
Um...

1485
01:42:20,620 --> 01:42:22,720
Your attacks can cause blast at gain.

1486
01:42:23,260 --> 01:42:23,340
Ooh!

1487
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:24,340
Oh, shit!

1488
01:42:24,620 --> 01:42:25,740
Three seconds, though.

1489
01:42:26,460 --> 01:42:26,740
Yeah.

1490
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:28,920
Three seconds.

1491
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:30,060
And then we'll grab a Hef.

1492
01:42:32,120 --> 01:42:32,640
Oh!

1493
01:42:38,770 --> 01:42:39,650
Oh, shit!

1494
01:42:42,210 --> 01:42:43,670
I should get the duo, right?

1495
01:42:43,850 --> 01:42:44,630
That's huge.

1496
01:42:49,610 --> 01:42:50,110
Yeah.

1497
01:42:51,170 --> 01:42:51,970
Don't grab armor.

1498
01:42:53,950 --> 01:42:55,310
And I have armor, too.

1499
01:42:56,670 --> 01:42:56,730
Nice.

1500
01:42:58,110 --> 01:42:58,490
Alright.

1501
01:42:59,190 --> 01:43:02,330
We have three, two death defiances.

1502
01:43:03,250 --> 01:43:04,950
Okay, we'll see how this goes.

1503
01:43:05,090 --> 01:43:06,330
I don't know how this is gonna go.

1504
01:43:08,850 --> 01:43:09,530
You again.

1505
01:43:12,310 --> 01:43:13,730
I don't know how this is gonna go.

1506
01:43:13,870 --> 01:43:16,790
I would say I'm quite unaccustomed to so many frequent
visits.

1507
01:43:18,230 --> 01:43:19,370
Sucks to suck, bro.

1508
01:43:21,150 --> 01:43:23,330
I didn't think the bus driver.

1509
01:43:28,190 --> 01:43:28,390
Yeah.

1510
01:43:29,150 --> 01:43:30,070
So lonely, bro.

1511
01:43:30,190 --> 01:43:32,070
You got pay people to hang out with you.

1512
01:43:32,730 --> 01:43:33,250
That's so sad.

1513
01:43:33,350 --> 01:43:34,470
That's why we put you in a home.

1514
01:43:34,670 --> 01:43:37,210
Well, technically he was put in a home when you think about
it.

1515
01:43:37,670 --> 01:43:40,690
You are unfortunately caught in the midst of a dispute.

1516
01:43:40,770 --> 01:43:41,750
Too damn bad.

1517
01:43:42,090 --> 01:43:44,330
The difference between having family around or not.

1518
01:43:45,650 --> 01:43:47,910
Because of you and this dispute of yours.

1519
01:43:48,230 --> 01:43:51,090
And now you'll be destroyed for what you've done.

1520
01:43:51,090 --> 01:43:53,390
Was it what when you put it that way?

1521
01:43:53,910 --> 01:43:55,970
No Have I not made any mistakes?

1522
01:43:56,190 --> 01:44:03,530
We would not be here now would we certainly not as such
vicious foes yet here we are Each in turn facing the

That's not fair, Grandpa.

1533
01:44:34,600 --> 01:44:35,380
And you know it.

1537
01:44:43,320 --> 01:44:44,460
Whoa, he just walked.

1538
01:44:46,920 --> 01:44:47,860
It's not fair.

1539
01:44:47,980 --> 01:44:48,820
You just walked.

1540
01:44:51,740 --> 01:44:52,540
That took you.

1541
01:44:52,640 --> 01:44:53,080
Oh, shit.

1542

Okay, that's not fair.

1547
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:05,260
Are you...

Oh, God.

1550
01:45:08,940 --> 01:45:09,400
Oh, God.

1551
01:45:12,280 --> 01:45:12,660
Okay.

It's fine.

1553
01:45:19,980 --> 01:45:20,680
It's fine.

1554
01:45:22,600 --> 01:45:24,080
Well, get rid of him first.

1555
01:45:26,500 --> 01:45:26,980
Jeez.

1556
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:27,780
Jesus Christ!

Okay, it's fine.

1559
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:29,920
It's okay.

1560
01:45:34,020 --> 01:45:35,540
I'm not a tank.

1561
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:38,840
Okay.

1562
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:43,060
It's okay.

1563
01:45:43,180 --> 01:45:44,040
It's okay.

1564
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:48,360
There you go.

1565
01:45:50,940 --> 01:45:51,960
I just need him to stay here.

1566
01:45:52,980 --> 01:45:54,140
Maybe he'll stay here.

1567
01:45:54,280 --> 01:45:54,620
I don't know.

1568
01:45:57,040 --> 01:45:58,480
I'm doing a lot of hope right now.

1569
01:45:59,420 --> 01:46:00,900
Are you fucking kidding me?

1570
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:02,780
Okay, that's bullshit.

1571
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:07,520
Oh god, what's going on?

1572
01:46:11,620 --> 01:46:12,720
Oh god, he's getting healed.

1573
01:46:16,600 --> 01:46:17,220
Are you fucking kidding?

1574
01:46:17,300 --> 01:46:17,840
Okay, that's fine.

1575
01:46:21,400 --> 01:46:21,820
Oh no.

1576
01:46:22,260 --> 01:46:22,720
Oh no.

1577
01:46:23,700 --> 01:46:24,160
Oh no!

1578
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:31,440
That's so unlucky.

1579
01:46:38,250 --> 01:46:39,230
Oh, God.

1580
01:46:44,830 --> 01:46:45,790
There we go.

1581
01:46:46,050 --> 01:46:46,310
There we go.

1582
01:46:46,430 --> 01:46:46,750
We did it.

1583
01:46:46,810 --> 01:46:47,510
We did it.

1584
01:46:47,650 --> 01:46:50,670
We did it.

1585
01:46:51,030 --> 01:46:52,610
Not even close.

1586
01:46:58,190 --> 01:47:00,530
Guys, not even close, guys.

1587
01:47:01,110 --> 01:47:03,210
You don't even know why you're fighting anymore.

1588
01:47:03,850 --> 01:47:05,190
To prove something to your children.

1589
01:47:05,650 --> 01:47:06,610
I'm so strong.

1590
01:47:06,790 --> 01:47:08,250
I was literally a glass cannon there.

1591
01:47:08,270 --> 01:47:09,910
He took everything from me.

1592
01:47:10,530 --> 01:47:11,410
Everything and more.

1593
01:47:12,010 --> 01:47:13,850
Now they seek for you to take the rest.

1594
01:47:14,550 --> 01:47:16,450
Such a wretched family, this.

1595
01:47:16,630 --> 01:47:18,410
Well, then you shouldn't have children.

1596
01:47:18,970 --> 01:47:20,910
That's your fault for not using protection.

1597
01:47:23,050 --> 01:47:24,950
He should have practiced safe sex.

1598
01:47:25,370 --> 01:47:25,910
That's his...

1599
01:47:25,910 --> 01:47:28,750
If he didn't want children, should have pulled out.

1600
01:47:32,550 --> 01:47:34,130
That's his own fault.

1601
01:47:36,990 --> 01:47:37,890
It's true.

1602
01:47:40,110 --> 01:47:41,650
That's his own fault.

1603
01:47:42,170 --> 01:47:43,230
Wrap it up, Grandpa.

1604
01:47:44,110 --> 01:47:45,170
That remains of time.

1605
01:47:45,490 --> 01:47:46,870
Damn, not wrong.

1606
01:47:47,410 --> 01:47:49,010
Full of game week.

1607
01:47:56,750 --> 01:47:57,850
That's his fault.

1608
01:47:58,310 --> 01:48:00,490
He did this to himself by having children.

1609
01:48:00,770 --> 01:48:03,370
To the abyss of the subconscious, I descend.

1610
01:48:07,810 --> 01:48:08,230
All right.

1611
01:48:08,970 --> 01:48:10,770

Oh, I'm having my first sibling fight.

dreams.

1635
01:50:54,640 --> 01:50:56,140
I'm gonna haunt you, brother.

1636
01:50:56,880 --> 01:50:57,860
This was a lovely chat.

1637
01:50:58,320 --> 01:50:59,380
See you some other nap time now.

1638
01:51:02,070 --> 01:51:02,850
Count on it.

1639
01:51:03,050 --> 01:51:04,170
And mark you my words.

1640
01:51:04,390 --> 01:51:05,370
We're going to fix this.

1641
01:51:05,450 --> 01:51:13,170
I just think 16 is way too old like maybe 13 because a lot
of you know originally you're not even supposed to go on

1642
01:51:13,170 --> 01:51:26,750
these websites at 13 anyway so like like 13 or 14 that's bad
but 16 that's a fucking teenager bro brother we shouldn't be

1643
01:51:26,750 --> 01:51:40,110
fighting i understand where zagreus is coming from but he
hasn't had to go through any of this make it 18 too young it

1644
01:51:40,110 --> 01:51:49,650
should be 18 yeah yeah when you can drink you can go on
youtube yeah because 60 is when you learn how to drive you

1645
01:51:49,650 --> 01:52:00,370
know my stance on this dora you need to get out of this tent
you're very talented i've never met a shade that speaks oh

1646
01:52:00,370 --> 01:52:10,490
no what if they have to watch tv No You're gonna have to go
back to TV

1647
01:52:13,610 --> 01:52:27,430
No They can't skip ads There's no ad block on TV Oh the
humanity Yeah There's no guys There's no ad block on TV guys

1648
01:52:27,430 --> 01:52:36,930
Who the fuck even still has Tivo The moon oft shines
particularly bright in one fair corner of the crossroads of

1649
01:52:36,930 --> 01:52:47,890
the underworld may always clear her thoughts and have a
moment's peace and listen to the frogs what Kronos fell to

1650
01:52:47,890 --> 01:52:55,070
you once more that much I heard it's an impressive feat
although you mean to bring him death yet he is deathless

1651
01:52:55,070 --> 01:53:02,550
this seems to be a paradox that's right mortal death is not
the end but mortals often think at least you don't have to

1652
01:53:02,550 --> 01:53:13,130
play league true that's a sacrifice we're as it may seem so
then to vanquish him must be at least a step toward that end

1653
01:53:13,130 --> 01:53:22,790
what shall become of everything if you succeed and time is
truly killed a world without time we'll live forever yeah

1654
01:53:22,790 --> 01:53:33,470
our world existed before time and can exist oh my god we're
gonna kill time let's go no more daylight savings guys We're

1655
01:53:33,470 --> 01:53:35,010
gonna do it, guys.

1656
01:53:35,170 --> 01:53:37,890
We're gonna cancel daylight savings.

1657
01:53:41,850 --> 01:53:42,450
More Jesus.

1658
01:53:42,650 --> 01:53:44,670
How would I not have enough for anything?

1659
01:53:45,270 --> 01:53:47,190
I'm so fucking poor.

1660
01:53:48,930 --> 01:53:49,570
Finally.

1661
01:53:49,910 --> 01:53:50,950
I found him headmistress.

1662
01:53:51,330 --> 01:53:51,790
My father.

1663
01:53:52,270 --> 01:53:53,810
Kronos has him locked away in Tartarus.

1664
01:53:54,570 --> 01:53:56,390
But I couldn't save him.

1665
01:53:57,190 --> 01:53:57,630
He asked.

1666
01:53:58,010 --> 01:53:58,570
Truly.

1667
01:53:59,370 --> 01:54:01,470
How utterly predictable of Kronos.

1668
01:54:01,490 --> 01:54:03,490
to gloat in such a way.

1669
01:54:04,490 --> 01:54:08,290
I regret that your reunion with Lord Hades thus transpired.

1670
01:54:09,150 --> 01:54:11,210
Though I am gladdened you discovered him.

1671
01:54:12,350 --> 01:54:13,090
How does he fare?

1672
01:54:14,930 --> 01:54:15,410
He...

1673
01:54:15,410 --> 01:54:17,130
I really wouldn't know.

1674
01:54:17,430 --> 01:54:19,310
Yeah, he's definitely having a mid-life crisis.

1675
01:54:19,890 --> 01:54:22,150
He looks like he's having a mid-life crisis.

1676
01:54:22,490 --> 01:54:23,310
He could still bestow.

1677
01:54:24,270 --> 01:54:25,070
What can we do?

1678
01:54:25,850 --> 01:54:27,290
Yeah, we'll do a surface run.

1679
01:54:27,330 --> 01:54:31,430
We'll do one surface run and then go back to do last Kronos
run and then commit to the surface.

1680
01:54:31,490 --> 01:54:35,650
Use full discretion and be brief, should you encounter him
again.

1681
01:54:36,550 --> 01:54:41,910
And I shall see about ensuring Kronos remains ignorant of
your newfound connection.

1682
01:54:42,390 --> 01:54:51,010
Speaking of time, I don't know how, but I accidentally
fucked up my PM AM for like Asia, like for the Asia goon.

1683
01:54:51,190 --> 01:54:58,330
So for some reason, I actually put like 530 PM PS, JSC
instead of 530 AM.

1684
01:54:58,610 --> 01:55:00,130
I don't know how I fucked that up.

1685
01:55:02,030 --> 01:55:10,770
it i was just like wait what beautiful night isn't it it's
been like that for a month i was trying to figure out how

1686
01:55:10,770 --> 01:55:20,830
long it's been and i did i don't know how i messed it up for
entire month moon dust oh yay moon dust i need that recently

1687
01:55:20,830 --> 01:55:28,290
although you always have an idea don't you would you believe
it doesn't block discord and roblox that's the fact that

1688
01:55:28,290 --> 01:55:33,730
robot they're like it's okay they won't be playing roblox
There's no 16-year-old that's willing to play Roblox.

1689
01:55:34,030 --> 01:55:35,490
I mean, they have nothing left.

1690
01:55:35,950 --> 01:55:38,050
I was like, bro, let's hang out in Roblox, guys.

1691
01:55:40,270 --> 01:55:41,730
One at the very least.

1692
01:55:44,370 --> 01:55:45,250
That's crazy.

1693
01:55:46,910 --> 01:55:49,070
I can't really give me Nightshade, of all things.

1694
01:55:50,310 --> 01:55:54,490
If they have nothing left, I mean, Roblox should be blocked,
though, I would agree.

1695
01:55:55,510 --> 01:55:59,770
Activate in the treatment attempt its chaos trials for
Stardust.

1696
01:56:00,310 --> 01:56:01,470
I mean, Stardust is...

1697
01:56:01,490 --> 01:56:02,250
Stardust.

1698
01:56:03,630 --> 01:56:05,750
What do I get out of it?

1699
01:56:07,210 --> 01:56:08,390
No, Roblox is fucked.

1700
01:56:08,650 --> 01:56:13,990
As ancient chaos beckoned me to say, awake, o monument of
night, I shall obey.

1701
01:56:16,250 --> 01:56:17,790
So moat it be.

1702
01:56:18,410 --> 01:56:23,610
We have a dragon that makes Roblox, Roblox, Roblox games.

1703
01:56:23,970 --> 01:56:25,730
Apparently he makes like four digits.

1704
01:56:26,270 --> 01:56:27,790
Is it four digits or five digits?

1705
01:56:28,150 --> 01:56:29,810
He either makes four or five digits.

1706
01:56:29,950 --> 01:56:30,690
I don't remember.

1707
01:56:31,490 --> 01:56:41,710

Like that's those children are gonna go wild.

1719
01:57:44,050 --> 01:57:45,190
Oh, there's the Chaos Trials.

1720
01:57:46,310 --> 01:57:48,390
What does the Chaos Trials grant me anyway?

1721
01:57:48,590 --> 01:57:50,150
I think I can raise my grasp.

1722
01:57:55,950 --> 01:57:57,370
Five, six, seven.

1723
01:57:58,150 --> 01:57:58,170

01:58:24,880 --> 01:58:25,920
Wait, I want to buy this.

1733
01:58:26,040 --> 01:58:26,500

Is it powered up?

1752
01:59:18,130 --> 01:59:20,830
Guys, what does it mean when there's red on it?

1753
01:59:21,510 --> 01:59:23,510
Does it mean my staff is powered up?

1754
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:35,800
Let's see Revealing influence reality as you know Because

No free will and no thoughts.

good later.

1774
02:01:08,280 --> 02:01:09,600

Oh my god, hammer right away.

This is where the dead have risen.

1795
02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:30,280
And Olympus teeters on the brink of doom.

1796
02:02:30,400 --> 02:02:34,280
This is going to be the first surface run because I spent it
all on killing grandpa over and over again.

02:03:44,100 --> 02:03:45,480
Okay, I gotta destroy this first.

1806
02:03:47,560 --> 02:03:48,600
Go Shades!

1807

1809
02:04:00,990 --> 02:04:01,430
Yeah.

1810
02:04:02,170 --> 02:04:03,050
I can't...

1811
02:04:03,750 --> 02:04:09,210
I'm so not used to having the... Was it... You know when I
have like the double the insane damage?

1812
02:04:09,390 --> 02:04:12,090
It's so weird not having the crazy damage now.

1813
02:04:15,910 --> 02:04:17,270
What the fuck?

1814
02:04:18,710 --> 02:04:20,410
I was like, who was following me?

1815
02:04:21,550 --> 02:04:23,890
Yeah, I heard the difficulty is like a lot harder.

1816
02:04:24,170 --> 02:04:27,690
So that's why I did most, I did like all the hell runs.

1817
02:04:28,050 --> 02:04:29,150
The grandpa runs first.

1818
02:04:29,490 --> 02:04:31,810
So I can be stronger to be on the surface.

1819
02:04:31,930 --> 02:04:34,910
You surprise me fairly often, little star.

1820
02:04:36,110 --> 02:04:36,550
That's me.

1821
02:04:39,630 --> 02:04:40,230
Defive.

1822
02:04:41,350 --> 02:04:42,610
X makes everything slower.

1823
02:04:44,610 --> 02:04:57,610
fight for you two or three they are slower but I don't know
if that's good three I would have another buddy what is this

1824
02:04:57,610 --> 02:05:19,180
what does this go oh is it like free shit oh oh it's like
free stuff extra loot room oh yeah it's like one I see.

1825
02:05:23,640 --> 02:05:24,360

02:05:27,760 --> 02:05:28,320
What?

1827
02:05:28,720 --> 02:05:29,200
Oh, okay.

1828
02:05:29,380 --> 02:05:29,820
It doesn't matter.

1829
02:05:29,920 --> 02:05:30,400
I was gonna summon.

1830
02:05:31,160 --> 02:05:35,060
I was gonna be like, I shall now summon someone over.

1831

Fight for me.

1832
02:05:37,460 --> 02:05:37,700
Okay.

1833
02:05:38,220 --> 02:05:38,780
What?

1834
02:05:38,980 --> 02:05:40,080
Oh, pylons remaining.

1835
02:05:43,890 --> 02:05:45,250
I love free stuff.

1836
02:05:46,710 --> 02:05:48,310
Is this one drink only?

1837
02:05:48,310 --> 02:05:49,850
The barrier's lost some of its strength.

1838
02:05:54,110 --> 02:05:55,130
The back cage.

1839
02:06:01,320 --> 02:06:01,780
Nice.

1840
02:06:03,340 --> 02:06:03,660

1841
02:06:04,620 --> 02:06:05,400
That's our fight!

1842
02:06:05,860 --> 02:06:06,680
I couldn't do it.

1843
02:06:07,580 --> 02:06:08,140
Oh, shit.

1844
02:06:10,780 --> 02:06:11,660
Okay, nice.

1845
02:06:14,900 --> 02:06:15,620
Holy fuck.

02:06:15,680 --> 02:06:16,780
I keep thinking like he's hurting.

Oh my god, I didn't want to summon this guy.

1890
02:09:03,860 --> 02:09:05,240
I didn't even want this guy.

1891
02:09:07,100 --> 02:09:08,000
Oh, what did I get?

1892
02:09:08,240 --> 02:09:09,140

1895
02:09:13,720 --> 02:09:15,980
I know he's like, but he matters, Doki.

1896
02:09:16,540 --> 02:09:17,520
What do you mean?

1897
02:09:17,720 --> 02:09:19,360
All minions are good minions.

1898
02:09:19,560 --> 02:09:21,040
Be nice to him.

1899
02:09:25,920 --> 02:09:26,320
Goodness.

1900
02:09:26,740 --> 02:09:27,400
That was fast.

1901
02:09:27,780 --> 02:09:29,260
And then we'll also grab magic, too.

1902
02:09:30,740 --> 02:09:31,700
Oh, I got money.

1903
02:09:31,900 --> 02:09:32,180
Okay.

1904
02:09:32,440 --> 02:09:33,400
I couldn't see it.

1905
02:09:33,420 --> 02:09:34,300
I wasn't looking at the floor.

1906
02:09:35,800 --> 02:09:36,200

1910
02:10:11,420 --> 02:10:12,920
Rude, Doki.

1911
02:10:15,460 --> 02:10:18,720
He didn't pick to be summoned, Doki.

1912
02:10:21,080 --> 02:10:22,940
He didn't want to be born.

1913
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:29,780
Imagine you see a barrier that Norris instances of damage.

1914
02:10:30,880 --> 02:10:32,380
Shadow cast faster and cast.

Okay, more people are voting for two.

Call upon Aerith.

1922
02:10:47,120 --> 02:10:49,080

1923
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:50,720
Makes it blocked.

1924
02:10:51,180 --> 02:10:52,000
Why is it blocked?

1925
02:10:53,680 --> 02:10:56,380
Um, I demand to...

1926
02:10:56,380 --> 02:10:59,060

1927
02:10:59,400 --> 02:10:59,780
Hello?

1928
02:11:02,040 --> 02:11:03,380

1929
02:11:04,480 --> 02:11:05,800
Do you know who I am?

1930
02:11:06,140 --> 02:11:07,220

1931
02:11:07,220 --> 02:11:07,960

1932
02:11:09,240 --> 02:11:10,300
daughter of Hades.

1933
02:11:12,160 --> 02:11:12,920
That's right.

1934
02:11:13,200 --> 02:11:14,440
I'm pulling the card.

1935
02:11:16,480 --> 02:11:17,820
There's like three Zeus's.

1936
02:11:18,020 --> 02:11:19,060
Oh my god, it's all Zeus.

1937

It's just, it's all Zeus.

1938

Oh, there's Hera here.

1939

Okay, we're going to grab this out of the way, too.

You all know he does not care.

1969
02:13:42,490 --> 02:13:44,090
He doesn't even care if you're an animal.

1970
02:13:46,210 --> 02:13:48,030
And we can't still get the...

1971

All is possible.

1985
02:15:06,290 --> 02:15:14,570
Across the river Akaram, the underworld boatman travels
between realms through hidden borders, unseen as a shadow in

1986
02:15:14,570 --> 02:15:15,350
the dark.

1987
02:15:16,930 --> 02:15:18,690
Is there anywhere Lord Gamba can grow?

1988
02:15:19,570 --> 02:15:22,190
It says, oh my god, that's a lot of dead sheep.

1989
02:15:22,630 --> 02:15:23,810
Oh, it's a Cyclops!

1990
02:15:25,010 --> 02:15:25,590
Oh no.

1991
02:15:27,510 --> 02:15:29,790
The Cyclopean Shepherd.

1992
02:15:31,950 --> 02:15:34,370
Why does he have eyes on his nipples?

1993
02:15:34,790 --> 02:15:36,350
What do I owe you for the inconvenience?

1994
02:15:36,890 --> 02:15:37,310

What did I do?

1998
02:15:47,870 --> 02:15:49,870
Your sheep will come back, I swear.

1999
02:15:51,690 --> 02:15:54,370
That's how he sees.

2000
02:16:04,290 --> 02:16:06,450
Why do you just raise cows?

2001
02:16:06,890 --> 02:16:08,290
No one told you to fuck.

2002
02:16:08,310 --> 02:16:10,030
raise sheep only.

2003
02:16:12,650 --> 02:16:14,110
Like there's no...

2004
02:16:14,110 --> 02:16:15,870
Jesus Christ, I don't know what he does.

2005
02:16:16,210 --> 02:16:17,130
Oh my god, that's what he does.

2006
02:16:17,530 --> 02:16:18,670
Oh, that's what he does.

2007
02:16:18,990 --> 02:16:18,990
Okay.

2008
02:16:19,830 --> 02:16:20,790
Okay, I get it now.

2009
02:16:22,110 --> 02:16:22,490
Wait, what?

2011
02:16:23,310 --> 02:16:24,150
Oh, let me go!

2012
02:16:24,270 --> 02:16:24,670
Let me go!

2013
02:16:24,750 --> 02:16:25,110
Let me go!

2014
02:16:25,190 --> 02:16:25,950
Let me go!

2015
02:16:28,190 --> 02:16:30,050
Oh my god, I didn't know he could grab you.

2016
02:16:30,090 --> 02:16:31,150
Oh my god, he's a grappler.

2017
02:16:31,570 --> 02:16:32,550
He's a fucking grappler.

2018
02:16:34,110 --> 02:16:35,130
Oh my god.

2019
02:16:35,510 --> 02:16:36,550
The man's a grappler.

2020
02:16:39,910 --> 02:16:41,350
Jesus Christ.

2021
02:16:46,480 --> 02:16:47,080
Rumba!

2022
02:16:48,120 --> 02:16:48,700
Wow!

2023
02:16:49,120 --> 02:16:49,400
Wow!

2024
02:16:55,060 --> 02:16:55,360
Okay.

2025
02:17:00,880 --> 02:17:03,760
I'm, like, so scared to go up to him.

2026
02:17:08,020 --> 02:17:08,980
Okay.

2027
02:17:09,740 --> 02:17:10,140
Wow!

2028
02:17:14,850 --> 02:17:15,810
Okay.

02:17:20,850 --> 02:17:21,830
Oh my.

2031
02:17:21,850 --> 02:17:23,350
Oh, God, he's fucking ripping it.

2032
02:17:23,410 --> 02:17:24,270
He's shredding it.

2033
02:17:25,230 --> 02:17:26,030
Jesus, no!

2034
02:17:26,770 --> 02:17:28,210
Okay, that one was new.

2035
02:17:30,330 --> 02:17:31,090
That one was new.

2036
02:17:33,590 --> 02:17:34,950
I'll send another one in.

2037
02:17:40,450 --> 02:17:41,010
Oh, God.

2038
02:17:43,230 --> 02:17:43,550
Nice.

2039
02:17:43,910 --> 02:17:44,650
Oh, I got him.

2040
02:17:44,730 --> 02:17:46,150
I splashed his Achilles heel.

2041
02:17:49,470 --> 02:17:49,950
Nice.

2042
02:17:50,550 --> 02:17:51,870

First tribe.

Okay, I get wool.

02:18:20,310 --> 02:18:21,470

Oh.

2071
02:19:25,330 --> 02:19:27,450
You didn't want to join my crew.

2072
02:19:28,130 --> 02:19:29,730
I'm not cool enough.

2073
02:19:30,510 --> 02:19:31,570
I don't understand.

2074
02:19:32,550 --> 02:19:33,310
I'm cool.

2075
02:19:34,090 --> 02:19:35,650
No ships risen from the depths.

2076
02:19:35,870 --> 02:19:36,410
Oh, shit.

2077
02:19:36,510 --> 02:19:37,650
All headed for Olympus.

2078
02:19:43,210 --> 02:19:45,210
My dragoons say I'm cool.

2079
02:19:45,870 --> 02:19:46,650
There's it.

02:19:48,030 --> 02:19:49,710
Say that again.

2081
02:19:50,150 --> 02:19:52,270
I failed the vibe check.

2082
02:19:52,830 --> 02:19:53,550
Take me away.

2083
02:19:53,990 --> 02:19:57,150

All right.

2088
02:20:39,970 --> 02:20:40,690
Jesus Christ.

2089
02:20:45,190 --> 02:20:46,010
Okay, is that my god?

2090
02:20:46,110 --> 02:20:46,630

All right, palm tab.

2092
02:20:49,670 --> 02:20:53,570
You automatically inflict a weak when you claim other work.

2093
02:20:53,750 --> 02:20:55,050
We should get more Gamba, right?

2094
02:20:55,330 --> 02:20:55,690
Three.

2095
02:20:57,630 --> 02:20:59,630
Your special deal is more damage and then flicks.

2096
02:20:59,730 --> 02:21:00,850
I feel like two?

2097
02:21:02,250 --> 02:21:02,990
No Gamba?

2098
02:21:03,490 --> 02:21:03,690
Okay.

2099
02:21:05,550 --> 02:21:06,850
More Gamma.

2100
02:21:07,230 --> 02:21:08,330
Come on, guys.

2101
02:21:09,150 --> 02:21:09,950

02:21:12,710 --> 02:21:15,470
How about Gamma where?

2103
02:21:20,120 --> 02:21:20,840
Alright.

2104
02:21:22,520 --> 02:21:24,180
Yeah, more damage in this lake.

2105
02:21:24,340 --> 02:21:25,060
Look at that.

2106
02:21:25,300 --> 02:21:26,020
Downers!

2107
02:21:26,520 --> 02:21:29,400
Now we get to every time.

2108
02:21:32,840 --> 02:21:33,680
Let it ride.

2109
02:21:33,940 --> 02:21:34,440
You're right.

2110
02:21:34,760 --> 02:21:35,560
Let it ride.

2111
02:21:36,820 --> 02:21:39,220
Now I have two gambas.

2112
02:21:40,380 --> 02:21:41,820
Never stop.

2113
02:21:42,200 --> 02:21:42,900
All in.

2114
02:21:43,300 --> 02:21:44,200
All in.

2115
02:21:44,560 --> 02:21:45,120
Guys.

2116
02:21:45,660 --> 02:21:45,960
All in.

2117
02:21:47,400 --> 02:21:51,000
That's not gonna blow up, right?

2118
02:21:55,820 --> 02:21:56,960
There we go.

2119
02:21:58,760 --> 02:22:00,800
All in on the gamba.

2120
02:22:03,700 --> 02:22:03,980
Nice.

2121
02:22:04,140 --> 02:22:04,960
I got tree break.

2122
02:22:06,700 --> 02:22:07,340
Ride it.

2123
02:22:07,400 --> 02:22:08,320
Ride the high.

2124
02:22:16,840 --> 02:22:17,960
Drop Blitz.

2125
02:22:18,160 --> 02:22:19,680
What the fuck is that?

2126
02:22:20,300 --> 02:22:21,740
What the fuck is that?

2127
02:22:24,220 --> 02:22:24,940
No idea.

2128
02:22:25,260 --> 02:22:27,980
They should be in a different color of their part of my
crew.

2129
02:22:28,680 --> 02:22:31,040
I'm literally so confused which one is mine.

2130
02:22:31,660 --> 02:22:33,860
Like, I know it has a giant heart, but still.

2131
02:22:35,140 --> 02:22:36,980
It's so confusing sometimes.

2132
02:22:40,620 --> 02:22:41,180
Alright.

2133
02:22:44,020 --> 02:22:45,600
I think you're cool, Jokey.

2134
02:22:45,880 --> 02:22:48,280
But, seriously, why do I know?

2135
02:22:48,440 --> 02:22:49,900
Bama, you think you're the super chat.

2136
02:22:49,960 --> 02:22:51,180
You're not a loser!

2137
02:22:51,640 --> 02:22:52,520
I believe!

2138
02:22:54,020 --> 02:22:54,920
You're cool!

2139
02:22:55,360 --> 02:22:56,260
We're all cool!

2140
02:22:59,980 --> 02:23:05,040
But Jokey, if we're all cool, then we're not cool.

2141
02:23:06,640 --> 02:23:08,460
How can we all be cool?

2142
02:23:09,440 --> 02:23:09,740
Oh, wait.

2143
02:23:09,740 --> 02:23:11,540

Okay, we need... What is this?

2158
02:24:24,860 --> 02:24:26,420
Attack 75% faster.

2159
02:24:27,240 --> 02:24:29,180
Do we aim for the purple?

2160
02:24:29,600 --> 02:24:31,420
Guys, one, two, three, four, five.

2161
02:24:31,480 --> 02:24:33,300
Okay, do we aim for the purple, guys?

2162
02:24:42,760 --> 02:24:43,900
Try to go for blue.

2163
02:24:45,580 --> 02:24:46,320
Aim for top blue.

2164
02:24:48,460 --> 02:24:48,940
Oh!

2165
02:24:52,380 --> 02:24:53,400
Go for this.

2166
02:24:55,800 --> 02:24:56,900
The third blue.

2167
02:24:59,680 --> 02:25:00,200
Aim for this.

2168
02:25:00,280 --> 02:25:00,540
Okay.

2169
02:25:02,420 --> 02:25:03,200
There you go.

2171
02:25:09,040 --> 02:25:09,640
Alright.

2172
02:25:10,640 --> 02:25:11,500
We get Pissat.

2173
02:25:11,840 --> 02:25:12,720
What the fuck?

2174
02:25:13,080 --> 02:25:14,640
How do I kill that?

2175
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:16,200
There's no mistaking it.

2176
02:25:17,060 --> 02:25:18,980
How the fuck do I kill this?

2177
02:25:21,320 --> 02:25:22,640
Can't shoot that.

2178
02:25:23,080 --> 02:25:24,040
Oh, okay, never mind, I can.

2179
02:25:24,900 --> 02:25:27,740
Wait, does that mean like I can just...

2180
02:25:27,740 --> 02:25:28,400
Oh, shit.

2181
02:25:31,100 --> 02:25:32,300
Oh my god.

2182
02:25:32,660 --> 02:25:33,600
Oh, my...

2183
02:25:36,880 --> 02:25:38,120
Okay, oh, there he is.

2184
02:25:39,980 --> 02:25:40,020
Whoa.

2185
02:25:44,090 --> 02:25:44,510
Whoa.

2186
02:25:46,450 --> 02:25:47,470
Oh, did I get hit by that?

2187
02:25:47,810 --> 02:25:48,250
Can't tell.

2188
02:25:49,750 --> 02:25:50,810
Okay, this is not fair.

2189
02:25:50,910 --> 02:25:51,570
I don't have anything.

2190
02:25:55,230 --> 02:25:55,790
All right.

2191
02:25:58,530 --> 02:25:59,490
Where is he going?

2192
02:26:00,310 --> 02:26:03,330
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2193
02:26:06,130 --> 02:26:07,230
Oh, that's where it's going.

2194
02:26:08,350 --> 02:26:08,850
Oh, shit.

2195
02:26:10,630 --> 02:26:11,710
That makes sense.

2196
02:26:12,570 --> 02:26:14,210
I was like, where the fuck is it going?

2197
02:26:16,810 --> 02:26:17,170
Okay.

2198
02:26:22,010 --> 02:26:23,130
What the fuck hit me?

2199
02:26:24,290 --> 02:26:25,010
Oh, it hit him.

2200
02:26:28,430 --> 02:26:28,730
Okay.

2201
02:26:29,290 --> 02:26:30,150
I'll shoot this guy.

2202
02:26:31,590 --> 02:26:32,010
Oh, shit.

2203
02:26:32,150 --> 02:26:33,210
Oh, that's...

2204
02:26:33,210 --> 02:26:33,950
Oh, fuck.

2205
02:26:34,330 --> 02:26:35,230
Oh, that's a lot.

2206
02:26:35,310 --> 02:26:35,650
That's a lot.

2207
02:26:35,730 --> 02:26:36,090
That's a lot.

2208
02:26:36,150 --> 02:26:36,590
That's a lot.

2209
02:26:39,590 --> 02:26:40,650
Oh, I don't like that.

2210
02:26:44,760 --> 02:26:45,400
Okay, that's five.

2211
02:26:47,800 --> 02:26:48,300
All right.

2212
02:26:51,100 --> 02:26:51,760
That's five.

2213
02:26:52,480 --> 02:26:52,880
Jesus, fuck!

2214
02:26:53,320 --> 02:26:54,080
It was not five.

2215
02:26:57,100 --> 02:26:57,860
Yeah, it's okay.

2216
02:27:00,640 --> 02:27:01,540
All right, last one.

2217
02:27:05,360 --> 02:27:05,940
Last one.

2218
02:27:06,080 --> 02:27:07,180
GK, there's still one more.

2219
02:27:07,960 --> 02:27:08,660
I can tank it.

2220
02:27:08,780 --> 02:27:09,000
Yeah!

2221
02:27:13,900 --> 02:27:14,300
Vanquished.

2222
02:27:15,060 --> 02:27:16,360
Now I'll get Poseidon.

2223
02:27:16,540 --> 02:27:17,880
That was a mini-boss?

2224
02:27:18,860 --> 02:27:19,980
Jesus Christ.

2225
02:27:20,440 --> 02:27:25,080
That was so much for a mini-boss.

2226
02:27:25,380 --> 02:27:27,360
Was that an actual just mini-boss?

2227
02:27:29,360 --> 02:27:31,580
I feel like that's so much.

2228
02:27:33,520 --> 02:27:36,140
Oh my, yeah, that's so fucking hard.

2229
02:27:36,820 --> 02:27:39,060
I literally lost 100 HP for the mini-boss.

2230
02:27:41,640 --> 02:27:42,800
Pose were powerful.

2231
02:27:42,960 --> 02:27:49,260
When every sprint hit the first foe, Oh, yeah, we should get
this.

2232
02:27:51,300 --> 02:27:51,680
Three, right?

2233
02:27:52,500 --> 02:27:53,460
Three or one.

2234
02:27:55,440 --> 02:27:56,820
Damien hits with a powerful three.

2235
02:27:57,280 --> 02:27:57,400
Yeah.

2236
02:27:58,220 --> 02:27:58,740
Oh, yay!

2237
02:28:00,160 --> 02:28:01,160
I'll get bonus.

2238
02:28:02,640 --> 02:28:03,860
Oh, it's just money.

2239
02:28:05,160 --> 02:28:05,920
Oh, and another!

2240
02:28:06,180 --> 02:28:06,400
Yay!

2241
02:28:06,780 --> 02:28:07,640
More money!

2242
02:28:09,400 --> 02:28:10,520
Wait, that's bad.

2243
02:28:11,400 --> 02:28:11,980
There you go.

2244
02:28:12,760 --> 02:28:13,680
I got money.

2245
02:28:14,920 --> 02:28:15,360
Whoa!

2246
02:28:19,140 --> 02:28:19,580
Flagship.

2247
02:28:20,220 --> 02:28:20,520
Oh.

2248
02:28:21,520 --> 02:28:22,720
Not gonna lie.

2249
02:28:24,120 --> 02:28:26,060
Okay, I guess Zeus, look at that.

2250
02:28:27,780 --> 02:28:30,880
The cast caused lane moths to repeatedly strike one floor at
a time and a blind serve.

2251
02:28:30,940 --> 02:28:32,540
Take damage, your flow is struck by lightning.

2252
02:28:32,740 --> 02:28:35,000
Your lane boss effect may strike two times.

2253
02:28:35,160 --> 02:28:35,760
One or three.

2254
02:28:36,340 --> 02:28:37,940
Gamba always wins, exactly.

2255
02:28:38,040 --> 02:28:38,480
And another.

2256
02:28:41,360 --> 02:28:41,800
One?

2257
02:28:44,280 --> 02:28:44,640
Annalise.

2258
02:28:44,880 --> 02:28:46,040
Zeus came home.

2259
02:28:47,520 --> 02:28:49,220
Um, I'm making a 4 to everything.

2260
02:28:50,340 --> 02:28:50,680
Technically.

2261
02:28:52,480 --> 02:28:55,460
And special deals more damage and hitch.

2262
02:28:55,600 --> 02:28:57,000
Your cast costs Oh, wait.

2263
02:28:57,300 --> 02:28:57,540
Two.

2264
02:28:59,340 --> 02:29:00,340
Every... Or three?

2265
02:29:01,060 --> 02:29:01,680
Or three.

2266
02:29:01,920 --> 02:29:02,860
Glamour gain, right?

2267
02:29:05,400 --> 02:29:06,000
Three.

2268
02:29:10,340 --> 02:29:11,280
That's good.

2269
02:29:12,400 --> 02:29:13,360
Yeah, I get more magic.

2270
02:29:14,420 --> 02:29:15,420
Oh, God.

2271
02:29:15,980 --> 02:29:17,560
The main boss fight's gonna be hell.

2272
02:29:18,980 --> 02:29:20,620
I am not equipped for... Jesus!

2273
02:29:21,440 --> 02:29:24,320
I am not equipped for it.

2274
02:29:24,640 --> 02:29:25,600
Get shocked.

2275
02:29:28,920 --> 02:29:29,180
Oh, my God.

2276
02:29:29,300 --> 02:29:29,960
That's my team.

2277
02:29:33,520 --> 02:29:34,460
Wait, can I summon two?

2278
02:29:34,660 --> 02:29:35,060
Oh, no.

2279
02:29:35,180 --> 02:29:36,040
I can only summon one.

2280
02:29:36,780 --> 02:29:38,480
Alright, Hermes or Palm?

2281
02:29:38,940 --> 02:29:39,300
Chat.

2282
02:29:42,060 --> 02:29:42,720
Hermes or Palm?

2283
02:29:47,450 --> 02:29:47,870
Herm?

2284
02:29:50,190 --> 02:29:50,610
Hermes.

2285
02:29:53,010 --> 02:29:54,310
We'll do Hermes then.

2286
02:29:55,750 --> 02:29:56,410
Jesus, what the fuck?

2287
02:29:56,550 --> 02:29:57,550
I've seen this guy before.

2288
02:30:01,110 --> 02:30:02,430
This is my first time seeing that guy.

2289

2383
02:38:01,700 --> 02:38:02,000
Look at this.

2384
02:38:06,550 --> 02:38:07,050
There you go.

2385
02:38:08,810 --> 02:38:10,490
I didn't even expect it to get blocked.

2386
02:38:11,150 --> 02:38:12,350
Prophecy for Toad?

2387
02:38:13,630 --> 02:38:13,950
Money.

2388
02:38:15,390 --> 02:38:16,750
I'm gonna get a hammer for sure.

2389
02:38:20,930 --> 02:38:21,290
Oh!

2390
02:38:21,630 --> 02:38:22,110
Whoa!

2391
02:38:22,530 --> 02:38:22,530
Whoa!

2392
02:38:27,470 --> 02:38:28,510
Oh my god.

2393
02:38:28,910 --> 02:38:29,770
I did not expect this.

2394
02:38:30,330 --> 02:38:31,350
This is a lot.

2395
02:38:36,560 --> 02:38:39,140
Okay, I think this is the... Oh my god, it's the weaker one.

2396
02:38:42,380 --> 02:38:42,780
Yeah.

2397
02:38:45,460 --> 02:38:47,160
Yeah, why are you attacking me?

2398
02:38:47,240 --> 02:38:48,080
I thought we cool.

2399
02:38:49,200 --> 02:38:49,860
Are we not cool?

2400
02:38:51,080 --> 02:38:52,560
Oh my god, we are not cool.

2401
02:38:53,280 --> 02:38:54,660
We are definitely not cool.

2402
02:38:57,260 --> 02:38:59,160
Okay, I want to summon the...

2403
02:38:59,160 --> 02:38:59,540
There we go.

2404
02:38:59,620 --> 02:39:00,620
Yeah, I wanted to summon that.

2405
02:39:01,140 --> 02:39:02,520
That one seems cooler to summon.

2406
02:39:03,320 --> 02:39:04,960
It seems like it do more, too.

2407
02:39:05,620 --> 02:39:07,680
Jesus, they're so tanky, too.

2408
02:39:09,360 --> 02:39:10,640
Apparently are not my friends.

2409
02:39:15,240 --> 02:39:20,480
Your special gains, your special fires to protect at your
attack, deals, and also strike side.

2410
02:39:20,500 --> 02:39:22,940
I do charge attack a lot more.

2411
02:39:24,020 --> 02:39:27,100
I feel like I do charge attack a lot more, though, for real.

2412
02:39:29,100 --> 02:39:30,100
Susan, thank you for the super chat.

2413
02:39:30,280 --> 02:39:30,380
Thank you.

2414
02:39:30,480 --> 02:39:34,960
Yeah, this all sucks, but 99% of Gamma's quit before they
hit big.

2415
02:39:35,060 --> 02:39:36,480
You are the 1%.

2416
02:39:36,480 --> 02:39:38,020
Thank you for the super chat.

2417
02:39:38,220 --> 02:39:38,360
Thank you.

2418
02:39:38,560 --> 02:39:39,060
Thank you.

2419
02:39:40,680 --> 02:39:42,500
Two for shotgun DPS?

2420
02:39:44,380 --> 02:39:45,820
Oh, maybe that's better.

2421
02:39:47,580 --> 02:39:47,800
Okay.

2422
02:39:48,320 --> 02:39:48,900
Oh, you're right.

2423
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:49,620
We'll do shotgun.

2424
02:39:50,160 --> 02:39:51,160
I'm grateful Daedalus.

2425
02:39:52,280 --> 02:39:52,480
Oh, wait.

2426
02:39:52,520 --> 02:39:53,260
That's my guy.

2427
02:39:54,960 --> 02:39:55,460
Magic?

2428
02:39:55,660 --> 02:39:56,560
I feel like health.

2429
02:39:57,380 --> 02:39:58,240
I'm going to go for health.

2430
02:39:59,840 --> 02:40:02,600
I think I charge enough magic in general.

2431
02:40:05,280 --> 02:40:05,780
Okay.

2432
02:40:08,460 --> 02:40:09,160
There you go.

2433
02:40:10,580 --> 02:40:12,140
Where are the others?

2434
02:40:12,380 --> 02:40:13,500
Okay, there you go.

2435
02:40:13,840 --> 02:40:14,060
Jesus!

2436
02:40:15,840 --> 02:40:16,560
Okay, that's fine.

2437
02:40:18,040 --> 02:40:18,580
Okay.

2438
02:40:19,340 --> 02:40:21,340
Are you fucking kidding me?

2439
02:40:22,620 --> 02:40:25,300
Okay, these guys are very annoying.

2440
02:40:25,900 --> 02:40:26,360
For real.

2441
02:40:28,800 --> 02:40:29,480
Alright.

2442
02:40:31,120 --> 02:40:32,180
Summon him.

2443
02:40:34,920 --> 02:40:36,240
Alright, more HP.

2444
02:40:36,500 --> 02:40:36,800
Yay!

2445
02:40:36,980 --> 02:40:37,240
Another!

2446
02:40:40,640 --> 02:40:41,160
Yeah.

2447
02:40:43,280 --> 02:40:44,320
Uh, money?

2448
02:40:44,680 --> 02:40:45,360
We'll go...

2449
02:40:46,160 --> 02:40:48,360
I don't think I need that much money, so we'll go Harrow.

2450
02:40:51,040 --> 02:40:51,560
Gamba!

2451
02:40:52,040 --> 02:40:53,360
Oh my god, I fucking...

2452
02:40:55,500 --> 02:40:56,040
There you go.

2453
02:40:58,560 --> 02:40:59,080
Nice.

2454
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:00,440
That's good.

2455
02:41:01,960 --> 02:41:03,580
These guys are very annoying.

2456
02:41:05,680 --> 02:41:06,940
Oh my god, that's a dragon.

2457
02:41:08,840 --> 02:41:09,220
There you go.

2458
02:41:09,360 --> 02:41:11,300
I want to summon the dragon now.

2459
02:41:11,840 --> 02:41:13,120
The dragon looks cool.

2460
02:41:15,480 --> 02:41:17,200
He looks so cool.

2461
02:41:20,880 --> 02:41:23,140
Like, how much damage did I took?

2462
02:41:27,560 --> 02:41:29,460
Your moves create a fisher.

2463
02:41:29,560 --> 02:41:31,540
Your damage effects for each boom.

2464
02:41:32,320 --> 02:41:33,400
Plus three.

2465
02:41:34,920 --> 02:41:39,180
I say join the count when you cast damage any foes whenever
they...

2466
02:41:42,680 --> 02:41:44,180
Whatever they appear.

2467
02:41:45,740 --> 02:41:46,380
Wait, three, right?

2468
02:41:47,380 --> 02:41:48,020
We'll go three.

2469
02:41:51,280 --> 02:41:52,000
Oh, hey, a flower.

2470
02:41:53,920 --> 02:41:54,820
Oh, another Poseidon.

2471
02:41:55,220 --> 02:41:57,240
Okay, uh, we'll grab Poseidon.

2472
02:41:58,440 --> 02:41:59,480
Poseidon or magic?

2473
02:41:59,640 --> 02:42:02,040
I don't think I need more magic because I have the regen.

2474
02:42:03,140 --> 02:42:03,280
Right?

2475
02:42:08,120 --> 02:42:08,840
Right, guys?

2476
02:42:09,060 --> 02:42:11,060
It should be fine if I go for...

2477
02:42:11,060 --> 02:42:11,660
Yeah, I have a lot.

2478
02:42:11,680 --> 02:42:13,680
lot of regen, so it should be fine.

2479
02:42:15,620 --> 02:42:16,980
Regen is super slow.

2480
02:42:17,400 --> 02:42:18,840
Okay, well that's too late, guys.

2481
02:42:22,340 --> 02:42:23,380
Guys, it's too late.

2482
02:42:23,500 --> 02:42:24,900
I already did it.

2483
02:42:25,040 --> 02:42:25,380
Oh my god.

2484
02:42:25,640 --> 02:42:26,440
God damn it.

2485
02:42:27,640 --> 02:42:28,740
I thought it'd be someone else.

2486
02:42:34,300 --> 02:42:34,420
Okay.

2487
02:42:37,880 --> 02:42:40,160
Holy fuck, that's a lot of...

2488
02:42:40,680 --> 02:42:42,080
That's a lot of armor.

2489
02:42:42,780 --> 02:42:43,160
Oh.

2490
02:42:44,880 --> 02:42:47,080
Oh my god, they have so much armor.

2491
02:42:49,400 --> 02:42:49,840
Nice.

2492
02:42:51,600 --> 02:42:53,700
Holy shit, that was so much armor.

2493
02:42:55,800 --> 02:42:56,200
Oh!

2494
02:42:57,680 --> 02:42:58,520
Is that chaos?

2495
02:42:58,740 --> 02:42:59,880
Oh, I know, that's just a choice.

2496
02:43:02,520 --> 02:43:03,920
Your moves also launched...

2497
02:43:03,920 --> 02:43:05,540
God, I can't even get any duels.

2498
02:43:06,780 --> 02:43:10,320
But you prime his surrounding foes with power splashes, they
start to strike.

2499
02:43:11,360 --> 02:43:12,680
Also launch a wave.

2500
02:43:12,800 --> 02:43:14,180
I don't cast it enough.

2501
02:43:17,320 --> 02:43:19,100
Also launch a wide wave.

2502
02:43:19,320 --> 02:43:20,600
Yeah, I think I'm just going to do this.

2503
02:43:20,760 --> 02:43:21,460
I'm going to prime it.

2504
02:43:22,260 --> 02:43:23,300
It should be fine.

2505
02:43:25,360 --> 02:43:26,840
Yeah, I have enough for it.

2506
02:43:27,840 --> 02:43:29,680
Alright, Hera or Zeus chat.

2507
02:43:31,040 --> 02:43:32,080
Which is better for me?

2508
02:43:33,780 --> 02:43:34,760
Hera or Zeus?

2509
02:43:38,210 --> 02:43:38,730
Zeus?

2510
02:43:39,150 --> 02:43:40,350
Is that better stuff for me?

2511
02:43:41,530 --> 02:43:43,290
Alright, it's a boss fight, though.

2512
02:43:44,130 --> 02:43:46,210
Alright, mini boss fight time.

2513
02:43:46,550 --> 02:43:48,110
We might lose our death.

2514
02:43:48,190 --> 02:43:49,010
Defiance.

2515
02:43:49,730 --> 02:43:52,250
Please tell me you're smarter than the other automatons
around here.

2516
02:43:53,010 --> 02:43:54,230
Oh, we don't get help, too.

2517
02:43:54,890 --> 02:43:55,930
And that's the worst part.

2518
02:43:58,250 --> 02:43:59,610
Oh, my God, please.

2519
02:44:01,170 --> 02:44:02,470
Please be nice to me.

2520
02:44:02,770 --> 02:44:03,130
Oh, my God.

2521
02:44:03,210 --> 02:44:04,390
I'm burning myself, too.

2522
02:44:06,050 --> 02:44:06,370
Oh.

2523
02:44:09,830 --> 02:44:10,310
Oh.

2524
02:44:10,630 --> 02:44:11,310
That's fine.

2525
02:44:12,590 --> 02:44:13,450
Oh, fuck.

2526
02:44:14,190 --> 02:44:14,890
That's okay.

2527
02:44:17,510 --> 02:44:17,990
Oh.

2528
02:44:21,570 --> 02:44:22,910
Oh my god, are you fucking kidding me?

2529
02:44:25,370 --> 02:44:25,930
What the fuck?

2530
02:44:26,350 --> 02:44:27,270
What the fuck?

2531
02:44:28,930 --> 02:44:29,450
Oh god.

2532
02:44:30,130 --> 02:44:30,350
Oh god.

2533
02:44:32,970 --> 02:44:33,390
Please get close.

2534
02:44:33,630 --> 02:44:33,790
Oh!

2535
02:44:34,990 --> 02:44:35,730
Okay, not that close.

2536
02:44:35,790 --> 02:44:36,070
Too close.

2537
02:44:36,210 --> 02:44:36,450
Too close.

2538
02:44:36,590 --> 02:44:36,890
Too close.

2539
02:44:39,710 --> 02:44:41,130
Are you fucking kidding me?

2540
02:44:41,690 --> 02:44:41,950
Nice.

2541
02:44:42,670 --> 02:44:44,370
Oh, I lost a lot of HP though.

2542
02:44:46,550 --> 02:44:48,470
Oh, I lost too many HP.

2543
02:44:48,590 --> 02:44:49,730
I just didn't know what he does.

I chose the duo.

02:56:35,070 --> 02:56:37,590
The pattern was so long, chat!

2677
02:56:38,330 --> 02:56:39,590
Oh my god, you bitch.

2678
02:56:39,730 --> 02:56:40,230
I'll pick up you.

2679
02:56:40,630 --> 02:56:42,610
It sucks that I will pick up your rags.

2681
02:56:44,850 --> 02:56:45,530

That's why I've been saying!

2684
02:56:50,130 --> 02:56:51,290
Show your face again here.

2685
02:56:52,010 --> 02:56:53,010
No, it was five.

2686
02:56:53,070 --> 02:56:54,110
It wasn't three, guys.

2687
02:56:55,130 --> 02:56:57,450
The second one was more than three.

2688
02:56:58,170 --> 02:57:00,050
Sorry, babe, but I'm not going anywhere.

2689
02:57:00,790 --> 02:57:01,910
Think Nixon, Hecatee, and their...

2690
02:57:01,910 --> 02:57:03,510
Okay, I didn't understand what it was.

2691
02:57:03,630 --> 02:57:05,990
The first time I was so confused what the attack was.

2692
02:57:06,650 --> 02:57:09,050
I thought, like, I was like, why is it like picking it?

2693
02:57:09,150 --> 02:57:10,010
Like, is it a Gamba?

2694
02:57:10,230 --> 02:57:11,550
I merely mistook you for one of...

2695
02:57:11,550 --> 02:57:12,950
I thought it was a Gamba!

2696
02:57:13,130 --> 02:57:14,070
I didn't understand.

2697
02:57:14,210 --> 02:57:15,930
It was my first time seeing the attack.

2698
02:57:16,290 --> 02:57:18,210
I thought it was going to pick a random thing.

2699
02:57:18,350 --> 02:57:20,130
I was just like, what the fuck is he doing?

2700
02:57:21,750 --> 02:57:22,950
No, that was me, all right.

2701
02:57:22,970 --> 02:57:24,570
Then I had a great time.

2702
02:57:24,750 --> 02:57:26,470
Hey, I was like, I don't know.

2703
02:57:26,590 --> 02:57:27,310
Is she gambling?

2704
02:57:27,810 --> 02:57:28,370
I think I made clear.

2705
02:57:28,530 --> 02:57:29,550
I wasn't on your side.

2706
02:57:33,090 --> 02:57:34,330
Then you serve Kronos.

2707
02:57:35,730 --> 02:57:36,530
That's right.

2708
02:57:37,850 --> 02:57:38,810
Kronos sympathizer.

2709
02:57:39,790 --> 02:57:41,150
Oh, I've got more psyche, though.

2710
02:57:44,780 --> 02:57:45,200
Yeah.

2711
02:57:47,720 --> 02:57:48,280
All right.

2712
02:57:48,340 --> 02:57:49,200
Yeah, I got the rock.

2713
02:57:49,500 --> 02:57:51,460
I was just farming the rock.

2714
02:57:52,440 --> 02:57:54,120
I was just like...

2715
02:57:54,740 --> 02:57:55,560
All right, let's see.

2716
02:57:56,120 --> 02:57:59,600
That is like, I'm at least I can crit the rock before it
fucking kills me.

2717
02:58:07,710 --> 02:58:11,170
Alright, review the aspects when they're free to empower
each main weapons.

2718
02:58:11,430 --> 02:58:12,170
Okay, let's do that.

2719
02:58:12,870 --> 02:58:14,350
I mean, I have a lot of stuff, yeah.

2720
02:58:14,630 --> 02:58:15,490
It's aspect time.

2721
02:58:17,330 --> 02:58:20,330
I seek their aspects hidden from my sight.

2722
02:58:20,670 --> 02:58:20,850
Yeah.

2723
02:58:21,750 --> 02:58:22,530
As you say.

2724
02:58:23,590 --> 02:58:24,410
What else did I get?

2725
02:58:25,530 --> 02:58:27,970
I may have paid pretty far for my first try.

2726
02:58:31,130 --> 02:58:32,670
on the... What was this?

2727
02:58:33,550 --> 02:58:34,910
Nice contained and eternal.

2728
02:58:35,330 --> 02:58:36,750
For my first try on the surface?

2729
02:58:37,070 --> 02:58:37,370
Come night.

2730
02:58:37,810 --> 02:58:39,830
Reveal the guarded treasures of this realm.

2731
02:58:42,050 --> 02:58:43,290
See that, sisters.

2732
02:58:45,530 --> 02:58:46,370
Alright, what else?

2733
02:58:47,870 --> 02:58:49,070
I'll grab it.

2734
02:58:49,550 --> 02:58:50,650
I'll just grab everything.

2735
02:58:51,270 --> 02:58:53,250
No purging pool of Tartarus.

2736
02:58:57,880 --> 02:58:58,200
Alright.

2737
02:58:58,560 --> 02:58:58,920
Nice.

2738
02:59:00,880 --> 02:59:01,740
What's this?

2739
02:59:01,840 --> 02:59:03,600
Reveal hidden aisle where you me a story.

2740
02:59:03,840 --> 02:59:04,820
Okay, yeah, we need that.

2741
02:59:06,440 --> 02:59:07,960
Iron and dry wood.

2742
02:59:09,780 --> 02:59:09,880
Uh.

2743
02:59:19,980 --> 02:59:20,580
Alright.

2744
02:59:21,280 --> 02:59:24,460
Let's pick this up.

2745
02:59:25,440 --> 02:59:27,060
And then start farming again.

2746
02:59:29,240 --> 02:59:30,440
We're farming.

2747
02:59:31,260 --> 02:59:35,100
The embodiment of sleep doses interminably in a private.

2748
02:59:35,160 --> 02:59:38,340
Alright, we can do the last grandpa run.

2749
02:59:38,540 --> 02:59:39,940
We'll do the last grandpa run.

2750
02:59:40,160 --> 02:59:42,880
And And then we'll go back to the surface.

2751
02:59:43,220 --> 02:59:45,740
Because I just need one more grandpa to run anyway for the
sand.

2752
02:59:46,580 --> 02:59:48,260
It gladdens me to see you, Hecatee.

2753
02:59:48,820 --> 02:59:51,240
I have observed the stalemate upon Olympus holds.

2754
02:59:51,800 --> 02:59:54,420
Although the Titan Kronos musters forces in Afera still.

2755
02:59:55,320 --> 02:59:57,060
Shall I continue monitoring them?

2756
02:59:58,840 --> 02:59:59,980
Yes, Selene do.

2757
03:00:01,020 --> 03:00:03,920
Blasted Afera is the closest exit out of here.

2758
03:00:05,120 --> 03:00:10,480
Do you suppose they are prepared for a single assailant to
weave through their ranks?

2759
03:00:10,780 --> 03:00:18,040
isn't it ready the titan's forces are somewhat in disarray
thus no i do not think they are sufficiently prepared for

2760

2763
03:00:43,900 --> 03:00:45,020
I can't.

2764
03:00:45,980 --> 03:00:47,860
Uh, fuck it.

2765
03:00:50,440 --> 03:00:51,560

2771
03:00:57,660 --> 03:00:59,580
Okay, I can upgrade my weapons now.

2772
03:00:59,780 --> 03:01:00,800
So much to choose for.

2773
03:01:00,800 --> 03:01:01,980

Which is the most busted for the staff, chat?

2783

Which one is the most busted one for this?

2784
03:02:03,680 --> 03:02:04,180
Circuit?

2785
03:02:04,360 --> 03:02:07,020
When so does you're forming a psychic leash.

2786
03:02:08,260 --> 03:02:08,980
Oh, wait.

2787
03:02:09,780 --> 03:02:10,340

Each fire in place up to until you...

2789
03:02:14,200 --> 03:02:14,640
Wait.

Aww.

2791
03:02:22,920 --> 03:02:30,940
Whenever you use it, each fire is in place up to three times
until you use it again.

2792
03:02:32,120 --> 03:02:34,040
Circa with fire or lightning ring.

2793
03:02:34,300 --> 03:02:35,300

2794
03:02:36,400 --> 03:02:38,120

03:13:29,800 --> 03:13:30,800
I'm just all speed.

2906
03:13:33,900 --> 03:13:35,280
Oh my god, that's crazy.

2907
03:13:37,700 --> 03:13:39,980
That's actually crazy how fast I am.

2908
03:13:40,000 --> 03:13:42,940
Um, something is foot here on Olympus.

2909
03:13:43,740 --> 03:13:46,480
Rumblings, yet not even Poseidon knows the source.

2910
03:13:47,180 --> 03:13:51,660
Well, whatever cowardly maneuver Kronos has in store, we're
going to repel it.

2911
03:13:52,100 --> 03:13:53,220
With your aid, perhaps.

2912
03:13:53,320 --> 03:13:53,800
As me.

2913
03:13:55,480 --> 03:13:57,120
Tax influx, blitz, oh my god.

2914
03:13:57,120 --> 03:14:06,360
and blitz too the underworld of hades holds more than the
souls of the dead all right after you just restore it gain

surroundings even if in size i have a thousand hp i think i

03:15:06,880 --> 03:15:13,500
a thousand and twenty five is better than a thousand okay
that is true

2922
03:15:16,600 --> 03:15:23,840
hmm you are right does seem a little bit better

2923
03:15:29,140 --> 03:15:29,620
Yeah.

2924
03:15:31,500 --> 03:15:33,720
Oh my god, he had to walk away.

2925
03:15:35,660 --> 03:15:39,660
Though I admit to having some small weakness for the tall,
dark, and brooding types.

2926
03:15:39,940 --> 03:15:40,340
How is this?

2927
03:15:40,340 --> 03:15:41,980
This is a long-ass forest.

2928
03:15:42,320 --> 03:15:43,840
He's defacing our beautiful mountain.

2929
03:15:44,220 --> 03:15:44,620
Yeah.

2930
03:15:45,600 --> 03:15:46,420
I know.

2931
03:15:46,660 --> 03:15:48,000
The mountain was so pretty.

2932
03:15:49,280 --> 03:15:50,140
Create a heartthrob.

2933
03:15:51,500 --> 03:15:51,980
Oh.

2934
03:15:52,820 --> 03:15:53,920
Now for the rest.

2935
03:15:54,000 --> 03:15:54,980
Guys, I don't need more.

2936
03:15:55,160 --> 03:15:56,300
I don't think I need more.

2937
03:15:58,880 --> 03:16:01,460
Feel more damage to nearby foes.

2938
03:16:02,000 --> 03:16:03,320
Guys, we don't need more.

2939
03:16:04,460 --> 03:16:07,020
Guys, guys, we don't need more.

2940
03:16:07,680 --> 03:16:10,380
I have a feeling we might not need more.

2941
03:16:12,500 --> 03:16:13,680
Yo, try hard, sub.

2942
03:16:14,980 --> 03:16:16,240
Oh, I didn't even see the one.

2943
03:16:16,280 --> 03:16:18,200
I didn't even know what that was over there.

2944
03:16:18,520 --> 03:16:20,160
Olympus, I accept this message.

2945
03:16:23,520 --> 03:16:24,000
Yeah.

2946
03:16:25,540 --> 03:16:26,240
Oh, hey.

2947
03:16:26,360 --> 03:16:27,400
Oh, I fight Chaos?

2948
03:16:29,400 --> 03:16:30,840
Wait, you're not chaos.

2949
03:16:31,820 --> 03:16:34,740
That pitch black stone in our training grounds.

2950
03:16:35,920 --> 03:16:37,940
I've sensed it ever since your incantation.

2951
03:16:39,020 --> 03:16:42,380
A subtle influence of chaos on this realm.

2952
03:16:44,900 --> 03:16:46,120
Our goals are intertwined.

2953
03:16:46,660 --> 03:16:50,960
When I gaze upon the stone, I begin to see different paths
and possibilities in every facet.

2954
03:16:51,560 --> 03:16:53,100
Some leading closer to our victory.

2955
03:16:55,640 --> 03:16:57,640
It's very much disquieting.

2956
03:16:57,660 --> 03:17:09,560
know the choices that we make might all be pre-ordained to
some extent uh-huh i will say i'm not really like that

2957
03:17:09,560 --> 03:17:19,840
concerned right now are you fucking really wait where's the
third one i was like where is she oh wait that's not what i

2958
03:17:19,840 --> 03:17:26,040
wanted whoops oh my god

2959
03:17:30,580 --> 03:17:30,980
Okay.

2960
03:17:32,180 --> 03:17:33,000
Are you fucking okay?

2961
03:17:33,200 --> 03:17:33,380
It's fine.

2962
03:17:33,500 --> 03:17:35,080
I have like literally so much HP.

2963
03:17:36,300 --> 03:17:37,560
I still have a lot.

2964
03:17:38,700 --> 03:17:38,900
Alright.

2965
03:17:45,900 --> 03:17:46,520
There you go.

2966
03:17:46,760 --> 03:17:47,040
God damn it.

2967
03:17:47,100 --> 03:17:47,420
It's fine.

2968
03:17:47,560 --> 03:17:48,460
I didn't get hit though.

2969
03:17:52,310 --> 03:17:53,190
Alright, last one.

2970
03:17:56,510 --> 03:17:57,310
There you go.

2971
03:17:57,390 --> 03:17:57,890
It's fine.

2972
03:17:58,250 --> 03:17:59,810
That should do like, that should just kill her.

2973
03:18:00,310 --> 03:18:00,310
Yeah.

2974
03:18:01,010 --> 03:18:02,670
I was gonna say that should just kill her.

2975
03:18:05,890 --> 03:18:07,990
You have grown strong.

2976
03:18:08,230 --> 03:18:08,330
Yay!

2977
03:18:08,930 --> 03:18:09,570
That's me!

2978
03:18:10,450 --> 03:18:12,190
She's talking about me, guys.

2979
03:18:15,950 --> 03:18:16,590
Alright, nice.

2980
03:18:16,770 --> 03:18:18,010
I got the chaos dust.

2981
03:18:19,190 --> 03:18:20,150
I did as chaos asked.

2982
03:18:21,590 --> 03:18:22,590
I got the thing.

2983
03:18:23,650 --> 03:18:24,410
Oh!

2984
03:18:24,790 --> 03:18:25,070
Oh!

2985
03:18:27,930 --> 03:18:29,450
Reality restored.

2986
03:18:31,910 --> 03:18:33,670
That was easy.

2987
03:18:35,670 --> 03:18:37,210
That was for babies.

2988
03:18:38,090 --> 03:18:38,970
Okay, nice.

2989
03:18:40,770 --> 03:18:40,870
Oh?

2990
03:18:41,950 --> 03:18:42,750
Oh, okay.

2991
03:18:42,910 --> 03:18:43,630
Now I have this.

2992
03:18:43,770 --> 03:18:44,050
Okay.

2993
03:18:44,350 --> 03:18:44,730
I don't...

2994
03:18:44,730 --> 03:18:45,670
I can't do anything with it.

2995
03:18:45,730 --> 03:18:46,630
Alright, let's try this.

2996
03:18:46,970 --> 03:18:49,230
Let's try this one out for the first run.

2997
03:18:51,210 --> 03:18:51,850
For the...

2998
03:18:51,850 --> 03:18:53,670
Let's see if we can make it to Grandpappy.

2999
03:18:54,750 --> 03:18:55,250
Wait, what?

3000
03:18:55,830 --> 03:18:56,770
Oh, there's more.

3001
03:18:57,710 --> 03:18:58,590
What the...

3002
03:18:58,590 --> 03:18:58,610
What?

3003
03:19:00,450 --> 03:19:02,270
Oh, that's a lot harder now.

3004
03:19:03,110 --> 03:19:03,930
It's a lot...

3005
03:19:03,930 --> 03:19:04,810
It looks a lot harder.

3006
03:19:05,610 --> 03:19:05,970
Alright.

3007
03:19:07,470 --> 03:19:09,150
Make some dog treats?

3008
03:19:09,710 --> 03:19:10,410
Oh, shit!

3009
03:19:10,690 --> 03:19:11,250
You're right!

3010
03:19:11,750 --> 03:19:12,730
To get the pets.

3011
03:19:15,810 --> 03:19:17,270
I can grab this now.

3012
03:19:19,970 --> 03:19:21,330
Ah, that's a nice touch.

3013
03:19:21,930 --> 03:19:25,970
Not even the wiles and stratagems of that resourceful sack
of cities.

3014
03:19:26,390 --> 03:19:30,030
Odysseus may be sufficient to overcome the tight...

3015
03:19:30,030 --> 03:19:32,390
How do I make that dog treat here?

3016
03:19:33,210 --> 03:19:34,530
This should work.

3017
03:19:34,910 --> 03:19:35,510
What's this?

3018
03:19:37,370 --> 03:19:38,710
Jesus, there's so much stuff now.

3019
03:19:38,850 --> 03:19:39,370
Oh, there you go.

3020
03:19:40,710 --> 03:19:41,210
Yeah, there you go.

3021
03:19:41,350 --> 03:19:42,250
We gotta make the dog treat.

3022
03:19:43,730 --> 03:19:43,950
Yeah!

3023
03:19:46,350 --> 03:19:48,570
Alright, now we have doggy treats, too.

3024
03:19:49,490 --> 03:19:50,310
And we're a psyche.

3025
03:19:51,850 --> 03:19:52,710
Alright, let's head over.

3026
03:19:52,830 --> 03:19:54,610
Let's try the new weapon.

3027
03:19:58,360 --> 03:19:59,300
God, I'm so fast.

3028
03:20:03,520 --> 03:20:03,920
Alright.

3029
03:20:04,220 --> 03:20:04,960
Alright, let's do.

3030
03:20:10,450 --> 03:20:11,850
I'll get you, Kronos.

3031
03:20:12,390 --> 03:20:13,810
All right, Poseidon.

3032
03:20:16,430 --> 03:20:18,190
Man, I'm fucking...

3033
03:20:18,190 --> 03:20:22,110
I'm like that girl, that girl in League of the In Arcane.

3034
03:20:22,590 --> 03:20:23,990
Or whatever her name is.

3035
03:20:29,300 --> 03:20:32,880
All right, attacks hit flows with a splash that knocks other
foes.

3036
03:20:32,960 --> 03:20:34,300
Your special, Winner Sprint.

3037
03:20:35,160 --> 03:20:37,360
Special hits foes with splash that knocks.

3038
03:20:38,400 --> 03:20:39,580
My special is my right.

3039
03:20:39,600 --> 03:20:41,660
I feel like it knocks other foes.

3040
03:20:43,760 --> 03:20:45,240
The one that punches.

3041
03:20:46,000 --> 03:20:46,660
One red.

3042
03:20:47,600 --> 03:20:49,100
Yeah, Jane Arcade.

3043
03:20:49,740 --> 03:20:50,760
Oh my god.

3044
03:20:51,020 --> 03:20:51,220
Whoa.

3045
03:20:52,320 --> 03:20:52,800
Damn.

3046
03:20:53,180 --> 03:20:54,040
That shit was crazy.

3047
03:20:55,480 --> 03:20:56,920
I did not expect that.

3048
03:21:01,890 --> 03:21:02,370
Okay.

3049
03:21:03,130 --> 03:21:04,950
What is the...

3050
03:21:05,810 --> 03:21:06,490
Okay.

3051
03:21:06,670 --> 03:21:07,590
I don't know about her.

3052
03:21:07,990 --> 03:21:08,870
Okay, her...

3053
03:21:09,710 --> 03:21:11,810
I will say...

3054
03:21:11,810 --> 03:21:15,010
Her right-click cast is not that cool.

3055
03:21:15,710 --> 03:21:16,930
I don't think her right-click cast is...

3056
03:21:16,950 --> 03:21:17,830
it's that strong.

3057
03:21:19,410 --> 03:21:20,190
Unless I'm wrong.

3058
03:21:20,510 --> 03:21:21,230
I could be wrong.

3059
03:21:21,370 --> 03:21:23,250
I'm always... I'm wrong quite often.

3060
03:21:27,210 --> 03:21:28,450
Omega normal is a shield.

3061
03:21:31,110 --> 03:21:31,730
Time of need here.

3062
03:21:31,830 --> 03:21:32,830
We need to get to the bottom.

3063
03:21:33,570 --> 03:21:34,650
Oh, wait, boons?

3064
03:21:34,810 --> 03:21:35,150
Okay.

3065
03:21:35,670 --> 03:21:37,150
Any game is worth more.

3066
03:21:38,130 --> 03:21:38,530
Ooh.

3067
03:21:39,070 --> 03:21:40,690
And cast your faster.

3068
03:21:41,030 --> 03:21:41,430
Alright, guys.

3069
03:21:41,530 --> 03:21:42,310
Two or three.

3070
03:21:43,070 --> 03:21:44,630
I only need that much money.

3071
03:21:49,490 --> 03:21:49,930
Okay.

3072
03:21:52,990 --> 03:21:53,470
Um...

3073
03:21:53,470 --> 03:21:53,730
Do?

3074
03:21:55,470 --> 03:21:57,390
Okay, wait, what is the...

3075
03:21:57,390 --> 03:22:03,510
Is that the shield?

3076
03:22:03,650 --> 03:22:04,470
Wait, what's just the shield?

3077
03:22:04,790 --> 03:22:05,090
This one?

3078
03:22:05,750 --> 03:22:06,970
Oh, I can't do it.

3079
03:22:07,270 --> 03:22:08,330
Wait, what gives the shield?

3080
03:22:09,310 --> 03:22:11,190
Left click or right click gives shield.

3081
03:22:16,090 --> 03:22:17,190
Which one gives it?

3082
03:22:18,850 --> 03:22:19,610
Hold for it.

3083
03:22:19,630 --> 03:22:20,590
Oh, for the shield.

3084

3087
03:22:27,170 --> 03:22:27,910
Holy fuck.

My left, yeah.

3092
03:22:39,590 --> 03:22:41,330
I feel like my...

3093
03:22:42,010 --> 03:22:43,970
It does so much damage.

3094
03:22:49,750 --> 03:22:51,990
Oh, I haven't seen the meter in a long time.

3095
03:22:55,790 --> 03:22:57,970
Jesus Christ, that's a lot of damage.

3096
03:23:01,290 --> 03:23:02,670
Oh my god.

3097
03:23:04,090 --> 03:23:04,490

3100
03:23:15,000 --> 03:23:16,480
I haven't seen the meter in a long time.

3101
03:23:16,740 --> 03:23:17,800
I have so many gods now.

3102
03:23:20,460 --> 03:23:23,020
Oh, I might make some spicy noodles for dinner.

3103
03:23:23,700 --> 03:23:25,200
Because my gums are full.

3104
03:23:25,260 --> 03:23:26,680
I think my gums are fully healing them.

3105
03:23:26,800 --> 03:23:28,520
Well, not fully, but they're healed enough.

3106
03:23:29,040 --> 03:23:31,820
Like, it's okay.

3107
03:23:32,660 --> 03:23:34,000

3255
03:33:51,240 --> 03:33:52,360
Okay, this...

3256
03:33:52,360 --> 03:33:53,660
I've taken so much damage.

3257
03:33:53,900 --> 03:33:55,640
This is the worst I've done against here.

3258
03:33:57,540 --> 03:34:00,420
Know only that I would not willingly confront...

3259
03:34:01,440 --> 03:34:02,580
She has done...

3260
03:34:02,580 --> 03:34:05,940
This one has the most random moveset she has ever done on
me.

3261
03:34:06,680 --> 03:34:08,940
Like, she has never cloned that much until now.

3262
03:34:09,220 --> 03:34:10,040
I passed the test.

3263
03:34:11,320 --> 03:34:12,240
And I managed...

3264
03:34:12,240 --> 03:34:13,740
Maybe I should not pick the flower.

3265
03:34:14,540 --> 03:34:16,060
Maybe I shouldn't have picked the flower.

3266
03:34:19,220 --> 03:34:22,480
Yeah, usually she never does the fucking clone shit.

3267
03:34:26,960 --> 03:34:29,200
Ain't sure any goods cost...

3268
03:34:30,400 --> 03:34:32,040
Uh, 3% less.

3269
03:34:32,200 --> 03:34:47,860
gain plus two now now we're fine hey whenever you enter a
location grab that again we have so much money yeah i got

3270
03:34:47,860 --> 03:34:58,380
too used to a thousand hp yeah yeah my children are crafty
to them you are nothing but a common tool and not an

3271
03:34:58,380 --> 03:35:00,680
especially sharp one it appears to me

3272
03:35:05,380 --> 03:35:07,780
All right, here you go.

3273
03:35:08,680 --> 03:35:13,000
Oh, and at that we can just do surface runs after that.

3274
03:35:13,720 --> 03:35:15,640
Because I should have everything I need, right?

3275
03:35:16,960 --> 03:35:18,420
All right, water time.

3276
03:35:18,560 --> 03:35:19,800
I'm sorry, money time.

3277
03:35:23,860 --> 03:35:23,980
Oh.

3278
03:35:25,660 --> 03:35:26,220
This?

3279
03:35:29,100 --> 03:35:30,500
Your ship beat up.

3280
03:35:30,900 --> 03:35:31,500
What the fuck?

3281
03:35:31,640 --> 03:35:31,800
What the?

3282
03:35:32,420 --> 03:35:34,300
Well, I'm trying to beat your ass up.

3283
03:35:35,280 --> 03:35:35,500
Hello?

3284
03:35:37,360 --> 03:35:37,800
Nice.

3285
03:35:41,200 --> 03:35:44,040
Okay, I really need to get regender for sure.

3286
03:35:51,480 --> 03:35:52,700
Holy shit, that's a lot.

3287
03:35:52,840 --> 03:35:54,540
Oh my god, that was so fast.

3288
03:35:56,560 --> 03:35:57,640
Okay, oh, fuck.

3289
03:35:59,440 --> 03:36:01,040
Like, I was like, that's alright.

3290
03:36:01,180 --> 03:36:02,420
Little Sim won't hurt anybody.

3291
03:36:03,820 --> 03:36:04,820
It hurt a lot.

3292
03:36:07,140 --> 03:36:08,760
Oh, I can't afford everything.

3293
03:36:09,040 --> 03:36:10,240
I'll buy a head first.

3294
03:36:12,640 --> 03:36:15,040
Show some of it and restore 150.

3295
03:36:16,100 --> 03:36:17,820
Give them redemption armor.

3296
03:36:18,680 --> 03:36:19,280
Mmm, two.

3297
03:36:19,440 --> 03:36:20,540
Wait, which one, chat?

3298
03:36:22,700 --> 03:36:24,720
Yeah, just exfoliating the skin real quick.

3299
03:36:24,880 --> 03:36:27,520
Just doing it with a little bit of treatment, getting a
little bit of sauna in.

3300
03:36:33,000 --> 03:36:34,000
Two might be good?

3301
03:36:34,900 --> 03:36:35,940
Three or two.

3302
03:36:37,880 --> 03:36:38,360
Aww.

3303
03:36:40,900 --> 03:36:42,320
I'll do too.

3304
03:36:44,600 --> 03:36:46,200
Oh, to one I don't want.

3305
03:36:47,980 --> 03:36:49,340
Thanks, I guess.

3306
03:36:49,800 --> 03:36:51,640
I was like, oh, she's gonna give me three.

3307
03:36:51,940 --> 03:36:52,260
Oh!

3308
03:36:53,240 --> 03:36:56,120
This woman was ever a twisted pathway through this world.

3309
03:36:56,520 --> 03:36:58,400
Yet I provide for him my light.

3310
03:36:58,580 --> 03:37:01,940
Nevertheless, he need not always find his way alone.

3311
03:37:04,180 --> 03:37:05,040
It's okay.

3312
03:37:05,140 --> 03:37:05,940
I didn't need it.

3313
03:37:05,980 --> 03:37:06,640
Oh, hey, nice.

3314
03:37:06,680 --> 03:37:07,000
Heels.

3315
03:37:08,020 --> 03:37:08,500
Yeah.

3316
03:37:08,840 --> 03:37:09,380
Oh, nice.

3317
03:37:09,420 --> 03:37:10,480
We got the healed one.

3318
03:37:10,500 --> 03:37:12,080
Okay, that's good.

3319
03:37:13,500 --> 03:37:13,880
Zeus here.

3320
03:37:14,020 --> 03:37:14,620
We'll get Zeus.

3321
03:37:15,360 --> 03:37:16,360
We need Zeus anyway.

3322
03:37:17,880 --> 03:37:21,540
Might be able to grab Blitz too.

3323
03:37:26,300 --> 03:37:26,660
Okay.

3324
03:37:27,480 --> 03:37:27,880
What?

3325
03:37:28,020 --> 03:37:28,640
That didn't hit?

3326
03:37:28,960 --> 03:37:29,700
I thought that would hit.

3327
03:37:30,660 --> 03:37:31,180
Out.

3328
03:37:32,980 --> 03:37:34,060
Okay, that sucks.

3329
03:37:35,460 --> 03:37:35,780
Nice.

3330
03:37:35,980 --> 03:37:36,560
Lock time.

3331
03:37:36,840 --> 03:37:37,160
Oh, wow.

3332
03:37:37,240 --> 03:37:37,920
I didn't need to heal that.

3333
03:37:38,760 --> 03:37:39,280
I...

3334
03:37:39,280 --> 03:37:41,580
I was like...

3335
03:37:41,580 --> 03:37:42,680
Oh, my God.

3336
03:37:42,680 --> 03:37:43,320
Not the same.

3337
03:37:43,400 --> 03:37:45,000
Not the same!

3338
03:37:46,280 --> 03:37:47,140
I dubbed Sana!

3339
03:37:50,540 --> 03:37:51,500
That was an accident.

3340
03:37:51,780 --> 03:37:53,400
Olympus, I accept this message.

3341
03:37:55,540 --> 03:37:56,580
Gink dodge.

3342
03:37:57,520 --> 03:37:58,560
Hard target.

3343
03:37:58,960 --> 03:37:59,380
Most foes.

3344
03:37:59,500 --> 03:38:01,120
Okay, we'll get the slower.

3345
03:38:02,120 --> 03:38:03,020
Dash more frequent.

3346
03:38:03,080 --> 03:38:04,740
I don't think I need Dash that much.

3347
03:38:05,560 --> 03:38:06,140
I think I'm fat.

3348
03:38:06,260 --> 03:38:07,100
Oh hey, Narcissus.

3349
03:38:08,000 --> 03:38:08,820
Narcissus tab.

3350
03:38:10,640 --> 03:38:11,160
Yeah.

3351
03:38:13,220 --> 03:38:15,280
Yeah, I don't know, right?

3352
03:38:16,160 --> 03:38:17,100
God, I know.

3353
03:38:17,780 --> 03:38:19,000
I spoke to Echo about you.

3354
03:38:19,700 --> 03:38:21,020
Said you didn't mean to hurt her.

3355
03:38:21,400 --> 03:38:22,740
Though, perhaps I shouldn't have.

3356
03:38:23,620 --> 03:38:26,660
She responded in her usual way, but I could tell something
happened.

3357
03:38:27,120 --> 03:38:31,140
Bro, he broke so many people's hearts that Echo is just one
of the thousands.

3358
03:38:32,340 --> 03:38:32,820
Yeah.

3359
03:38:33,080 --> 03:38:33,320
Yeah.

3360
03:38:34,520 --> 03:38:37,460
Yeah, I'm sure she'll find someone who thinks she's awesome.

3361
03:38:38,280 --> 03:38:38,940
Plenty of fish.

3362
03:38:39,600 --> 03:38:40,520
In the sea.

3363
03:38:41,020 --> 03:38:41,840
In the sea.

3364
03:38:42,120 --> 03:38:43,160
Yes, I've noticed.

3365
03:38:43,840 --> 03:38:46,620
So, has anybody ever fallen out of love with you?

3366
03:38:47,120 --> 03:38:49,720
Or do they all end up in the morning fields pining for you?

3367
03:38:49,780 --> 03:38:53,260
Yeah, it's his fault that he was just born so fucking
handsome, guys.

3368
03:38:53,880 --> 03:38:56,800
Oh, what a curse for him.

3369
03:38:58,000 --> 03:39:00,120
Love me much as much as me.

3370
03:39:00,660 --> 03:39:01,520
Freeze, bro.

3371
03:39:03,540 --> 03:39:05,400
I am my number one fan.

3372
03:39:10,400 --> 03:39:13,300
One boon, one palm, two.

3373
03:39:13,400 --> 03:39:15,200
I guess the pond, right?

3374
03:39:15,640 --> 03:39:16,160
Fuck it.

3375
03:39:16,300 --> 03:39:17,160
I'm getting the palm.

3376
03:39:17,340 --> 03:39:17,880
What did I get?

3377
03:39:19,600 --> 03:39:20,700
Molten touch.

3378
03:39:20,980 --> 03:39:21,540
Where's that?

3379
03:39:25,640 --> 03:39:26,320
Oh, okay.

3380
03:39:27,860 --> 03:39:28,540
Grab that.

3381
03:39:29,820 --> 03:39:31,420
He's just so handsome.

3382
03:39:31,820 --> 03:39:32,220
Guys.

3383
03:39:32,860 --> 03:39:34,320
Can you really blame him?

3384
03:39:34,480 --> 03:39:38,060
Like, he was born with such...

3385
03:39:40,940 --> 03:39:41,780
Oh my god.

3386
03:39:41,900 --> 03:39:42,400
Oh my god!

3387
03:39:42,540 --> 03:39:43,440
Oh, that was an accident!

3388
03:39:45,060 --> 03:39:47,060
I just took all of that.

3389
03:39:48,100 --> 03:39:49,740
Let's see, I can heal it.

3390
03:39:50,620 --> 03:39:56,180
Uh, forums, I guess your freeze effect lasts longer.

3391
03:39:57,260 --> 03:39:58,360
Are you clear?

3392
03:39:58,540 --> 03:39:59,880
In random boom, you have gains.

3393
03:40:00,180 --> 03:40:00,340
Oh!

3394
03:40:01,600 --> 03:40:02,440
Wait, three!

3395
03:40:03,840 --> 03:40:05,640
I just like tanked the entire thing.

3396
03:40:06,380 --> 03:40:07,140
Wait, three!

3397
03:40:07,520 --> 03:40:07,840
Right?

3398
03:40:12,420 --> 03:40:13,020
Yeah.

3399
03:40:15,440 --> 03:40:16,400
Bit late.

3400
03:40:16,580 --> 03:40:17,300
Oh, whoop.

3401
03:40:17,680 --> 03:40:19,240
I took it anyway.

3402
03:40:23,500 --> 03:40:26,860
There's a lot of counters though, I'm pretty sure, right?

3403
03:40:29,810 --> 03:40:30,590
All right.

3404
03:40:34,540 --> 03:40:36,920
Okay, let's grab him there.

3405
03:40:39,500 --> 03:40:43,590
And then...

3406
03:40:43,590 --> 03:40:45,530
Jesus Christ, will it hit something?

3407
03:40:45,830 --> 03:40:48,050
Like, I'm like, hit something!

3408
03:40:49,650 --> 03:40:52,290
Okay, your special locks on faster and use this...

3409
03:40:52,810 --> 03:40:54,610
your special launch and fly!

3410
03:40:55,210 --> 03:40:55,610
Oh!

3411
03:40:57,990 --> 03:40:59,650
Let's turn if it's damage to armor.

3412
03:41:00,050 --> 03:41:00,830
Fuck, okay.

3413
03:41:05,850 --> 03:41:06,350
But...

3414
03:41:07,610 --> 03:41:09,470
Yeah, we have extra damage.

3415
03:41:12,310 --> 03:41:13,330
One or two.

3416
03:41:16,350 --> 03:41:17,550
Which is better, chat?

3417
03:41:20,850 --> 03:41:21,310
Three?

3418
03:41:23,590 --> 03:41:25,270
A lot of people are saying three.

3419
03:41:26,030 --> 03:41:26,370
Oh, wait.

3420
03:41:26,430 --> 03:41:26,970
Not a lot of people.

3421
03:41:26,990 --> 03:41:35,730
It's one guy spamming three That just Never mind I realize
It's one guy spamming three

Okay Pro almost won Pro almost won by voting Seven times

Okay, we'll do two.

3424
03:42:06,370 --> 03:42:08,990
He almost got me there.

3425
03:42:10,210 --> 03:42:11,130
See you in the crossroads?

3426
03:42:12,590 --> 03:42:16,250
Oh shit, wait, I mean I'll do this just for more money.

3427
03:42:19,510 --> 03:42:21,410
Oh shit, wait, that's so fast.

3428
03:42:21,490 --> 03:42:22,630
Wait, this is actually so fast.

3429
03:42:22,810 --> 03:42:23,170
What's this?

3430
03:42:23,790 --> 03:42:24,630
What the fuck?

3431
03:42:26,990 --> 03:42:27,830
Alright, hard.

3432
03:42:28,630 --> 03:42:30,890
Guys, Kronos or shop, chat?

3433
03:42:38,300 --> 03:42:39,280
I don't know.

3434
03:42:40,100 --> 03:42:41,840
I don't know if Kronos is worth it.

3435
03:42:41,980 --> 03:42:42,280
Oh, Chaos.

3436
03:42:42,520 --> 03:42:43,020
Sorry, Chaos.

3437
03:42:43,300 --> 03:42:44,880
Sorry, they both start with CH.

3438
03:42:45,560 --> 03:42:46,580
Chaos, okay.

3439
03:42:47,040 --> 03:42:49,360
They both start with CH, guys.

3440
03:42:50,820 --> 03:42:52,020
I got confused.

3441
03:42:56,740 --> 03:42:58,760
Make sure you lose.

3442
03:42:59,400 --> 03:42:59,820
Fire spells.

3443
03:43:00,240 --> 03:43:00,520
Ooh.

3444
03:43:03,120 --> 03:43:05,820
Surin undercaste's 39 damage.

3445
03:43:09,830 --> 03:43:12,530
Oh, that's so rough.

3446
03:43:13,710 --> 03:43:15,550
Three is so rough right now.

3447
03:43:20,320 --> 03:43:20,400
Two.

3448
03:43:20,720 --> 03:43:20,960
Okay.

3449
03:43:21,220 --> 03:43:23,160
This is going to be rough because I have to fight.

3450
03:43:23,300 --> 03:43:24,260
Oh, I felt it.

3451
03:43:24,320 --> 03:43:24,800
Yeah, no.

3452
03:43:25,220 --> 03:43:25,740
Oh, shit.

3453
03:43:25,800 --> 03:43:26,960
I already took damage.

3454
03:43:28,160 --> 03:43:30,260
This is going to be rough because I'm fighting.

3455
03:43:30,760 --> 03:43:31,520
Oh, no.

3456
03:43:32,060 --> 03:43:34,000
Oh, I can't do space.

3457
03:43:34,680 --> 03:43:37,420
Oh my god, I have to dash across.

3458
03:43:37,840 --> 03:43:39,640
That's not fair.

3459
03:43:41,300 --> 03:43:41,700
I...

3460
03:43:41,700 --> 03:43:43,500
Or that's not...

3461
03:43:43,500 --> 03:43:46,300
I have to dash across that.

3462
03:43:55,340 --> 03:43:55,740
Okay.

3463
03:43:59,640 --> 03:44:00,880
Alright, one, two, or three.

3464
03:44:01,620 --> 03:44:02,540
Okay, it's just mana.

3465
03:44:02,640 --> 03:44:03,480
Yeah, at least it's just mana.

3466
03:44:03,560 --> 03:44:04,400
I need to use the basket again.

3467
03:44:04,500 --> 03:44:04,900
I'll be right back.

3468
03:44:05,020 --> 03:44:05,220
I drink.

3469
03:44:05,320 --> 03:44:06,300
I hydrate so much.

3470
03:44:56,670 --> 03:44:58,590
Alan, Zekro, Nexy, Papa.

3471
03:44:58,690 --> 03:44:59,250

Okay, nice.

Alright.

3486
03:46:51,470 --> 03:46:52,490
I'm ready.

3487
03:46:58,660 --> 03:46:59,680
Okay, that's fine.

3488
03:46:59,900 --> 03:47:01,520
I'll just use up all my dash then.

3489
03:47:07,140 --> 03:47:08,300
Jesus Christ!

3490
03:47:12,710 --> 03:47:13,190
Oh god.

3491
03:47:13,790 --> 03:47:14,370
I got out.

3492
03:47:16,090 --> 03:47:16,690
Are you?

3493
03:47:16,750 --> 03:47:18,070
Oh, fuck, it's this way.

3494
03:47:23,620 --> 03:47:24,760
Let's go get it.

3495
03:47:26,120 --> 03:47:27,520
Oh, boy, whoa, I messed up.

3496
03:47:27,560 --> 03:47:28,480
I messed up a little bit.

3497
03:47:29,440 --> 03:47:31,760
I might be tanking it when I shouldn't be.

3498
03:47:35,920 --> 03:47:36,620
Oh, there you go.

3499
03:47:40,550 --> 03:47:42,330
Okay, girl, you gotta get out of there.

3500
03:47:42,690 --> 03:47:43,270
Come on.

3501
03:47:43,390 --> 03:47:44,030
Come on.

3502
03:47:44,850 --> 03:47:45,530
Here you go.

3503
03:47:47,030 --> 03:47:47,690
Oh, my God.

3504
03:47:48,090 --> 03:47:48,730
Oh, my God.

3505
03:47:49,170 --> 03:47:50,110
Okay, this is bad.

3506
03:47:53,370 --> 03:47:57,410
Okay, I might have tainted a little too much, guys.

3507
03:47:58,190 --> 03:47:58,190
Oh,

3508
03:48:02,590 --> 03:48:02,730
no.

3509
03:48:03,150 --> 03:48:03,850
Oh, shit.

3510
03:48:04,290 --> 03:48:04,950
Oh, shit.

3511
03:48:05,410 --> 03:48:06,510
Oh, I messed up.

3512
03:48:06,750 --> 03:48:07,570
I messed up.

3513
03:48:09,790 --> 03:48:10,670
Yeah, here we go.

3514
03:48:10,870 --> 03:48:11,210
That's it.

3515
03:48:11,230 --> 03:48:11,570
That's again.

3516
03:48:11,630 --> 03:48:12,810
I still made it.

3517
03:48:12,950 --> 03:48:14,030
I still made it.

3518
03:48:16,630 --> 03:48:17,510
That was awkward.

3519
03:48:20,130 --> 03:48:20,950
It's okay.

3520
03:48:20,970 --> 03:48:22,510
We still made it, guys.

3521
03:48:24,510 --> 03:48:25,290
2 HP, guys.

3522
03:48:25,490 --> 03:48:26,390
I told you.

3523
03:48:27,770 --> 03:48:29,050
2 HP.

3524
03:48:29,630 --> 03:48:31,550
Not even close.

3525
03:48:32,510 --> 03:48:33,590
Let's go.

3526
03:48:38,670 --> 03:48:40,010
I grabbed this.

3527
03:48:40,150 --> 03:48:41,370
I have so much money.

3528
03:48:41,530 --> 03:48:42,050
I might as well.

3529
03:48:42,930 --> 03:48:44,850
More than enough, guys.

3530
03:48:45,790 --> 03:48:47,670
That's more than enough HP.

3531
03:48:48,270 --> 03:48:49,170
Guys, I don't know.

3532
03:48:49,330 --> 03:48:51,630
I don't know if this weapon is for me.

3533
03:49:01,900 --> 03:49:05,780
I think at the end, I think the staff is definitely the best
for me.

3534
03:49:06,100 --> 03:49:08,860
It has the best balance between everything.

3535
03:49:09,940 --> 03:49:11,060
Alright, I will grab.

3536
03:49:13,960 --> 03:49:15,540
I just realized I'm using all my magic.

3537
03:49:15,920 --> 03:49:17,560
I already forgot about the curse.

3538
03:49:19,080 --> 03:49:20,640
I already forgot the curse.

3539
03:49:22,300 --> 03:49:23,140
I was like, whoa.

3540
03:49:23,660 --> 03:49:25,600
What's that sound it's making?

3541
03:49:26,460 --> 03:49:27,800
Is that a bad sound?

3542
03:49:33,780 --> 03:49:33,940
Eh.

3543
03:49:35,940 --> 03:49:38,060
Surely that's not a bad sound, right?

3544
03:49:44,230 --> 03:49:45,170
Alright, nice.

3545
03:49:45,750 --> 03:49:46,810
I need more damage.

3546
03:49:47,110 --> 03:49:48,690
I am... I'm so weak.

3547
03:49:55,010 --> 03:49:55,490
Oh, wait.

3548
03:49:55,670 --> 03:49:55,870
Where am I?

3549
03:49:55,910 --> 03:49:57,190
God damn it, I used it again.

3550
03:50:00,170 --> 03:50:01,290
Okay, here you go.

3551
03:50:07,040 --> 03:50:08,840
I want to get rid of these guys first.

3552
03:50:08,960 --> 03:50:09,880
The Medusa's first.

3553
03:50:12,400 --> 03:50:13,420
Are you serious?

3554
03:50:13,620 --> 03:50:14,920
What the fuck hits me?

3555
03:50:17,260 --> 03:50:18,520
Oh, fuck this.

3556
03:50:19,580 --> 03:50:23,620
I don't need the mana.

3557
03:50:25,520 --> 03:50:26,180
There you go.

3558
03:50:27,060 --> 03:50:29,460
I have two more encounters.

3559
03:50:32,200 --> 03:50:33,700
God, I feel so slow.

3560
03:50:34,500 --> 03:50:34,980
Fuck it.

3561
03:50:35,520 --> 03:50:36,600
Oh, hey, Pat.

3562
03:50:37,300 --> 03:50:37,760
God damn it.

3563
03:50:38,800 --> 03:50:39,620
Was that it?

3564
03:50:40,560 --> 03:50:41,580
Another tree somewhere?

3565
03:50:45,680 --> 03:50:46,880
Is there another tree here?

3566
03:50:51,320 --> 03:50:52,420
No, I know there's a hammer.

3567
03:50:52,580 --> 03:50:54,740
I'm just trying to see if there's anything else I'm missing.

3568
03:50:57,060 --> 03:51:00,360
I definitely feel like I'm under DPS right now.

3569
03:51:00,440 --> 03:51:01,320
I'm under damage.

3570
03:51:02,780 --> 03:51:03,760
No, I know there's a hammer.

3571
03:51:03,920 --> 03:51:06,240
I'm just trying to see if there's another thing around me.

3572
03:51:07,260 --> 03:51:08,220
I walked by a tree.

3573
03:51:08,340 --> 03:51:09,540
God damn it, I knew I walked.

3574
03:51:09,600 --> 03:51:09,860
Oh, wait.

3575
03:51:09,900 --> 03:51:10,760
There must be a tree nearby.

3576
03:51:11,280 --> 03:51:12,560
I'm following the golden petals.

3577
03:51:13,880 --> 03:51:14,500
Oh, there it is.

3578
03:51:14,660 --> 03:51:14,960
Nice.

3579
03:51:16,640 --> 03:51:18,920
No, yeah, the hammer's the only thing.

3580
03:51:19,200 --> 03:51:19,440
Look it.

3581
03:51:28,880 --> 03:51:29,360
Boom!

3582
03:51:32,100 --> 03:51:36,260
Yeah, I definitely feel very underpowered.

3583
03:51:36,960 --> 03:51:39,060
I feel like I could be stronger.

3584
03:51:41,020 --> 03:51:41,500
For sure.

3585
03:51:41,960 --> 03:51:44,140
My build is, like, not very ideal right now.

3586
03:51:50,010 --> 03:51:51,310
Yeah, it's low DPS.

3587
03:51:53,050 --> 03:51:56,710
Briefly gains plus five for up to five consecutive hits on
the same throw.

3588
03:51:56,990 --> 03:51:58,650
I don't think I can rely on that.

3589
03:52:00,370 --> 03:52:02,370
Uh, I'm going to do attacks faster.

3590
03:52:03,530 --> 03:52:03,850
Feels even.

3591
03:52:04,050 --> 03:52:04,290
Yeah.

3592
03:52:04,910 --> 03:52:07,390
If I attack faster, there's more DPS per second.

3593
03:52:08,730 --> 03:52:09,530
Uh, money.

3594
03:52:10,650 --> 03:52:11,890
Uh, power up my moon.

3595
03:52:17,690 --> 03:52:20,790
Yeah, at least I'll have like more DPS for it.

3596
03:52:25,640 --> 03:52:26,840
Where are the trees?

3597
03:52:28,080 --> 03:52:28,880
Oh, there's a tree.

3598
03:52:30,460 --> 03:52:30,920
Yay.

3599
03:52:33,120 --> 03:52:33,640
Alright.

3600
03:52:33,760 --> 03:52:34,540
Grab that tree.

3601
03:52:35,920 --> 03:52:36,820
Alright, moon money.

3602
03:52:36,940 --> 03:52:37,940
Oh, that's it?

3603
03:52:38,840 --> 03:52:40,760
There's no bonus items?

3604
03:52:42,340 --> 03:52:45,360
I'm so surprised there's no bonus items.

3605
03:52:50,340 --> 03:52:52,900
I expected, like, bonus shit.

3606
03:52:57,040 --> 03:52:57,460
Okay.

3607
03:53:00,710 --> 03:53:02,670
I stood that chance I had.

3608
03:53:03,150 --> 03:53:03,470
Nice.

3609
03:53:03,610 --> 03:53:05,170
Okay, now I can dash again.

3610
03:53:05,830 --> 03:53:06,430
Alright.

3611
03:53:08,830 --> 03:53:10,190
Let's see.

3612
03:53:10,550 --> 03:53:18,890
you gain one more hex your hex also restores any you lost
during the last two seconds when you hex you gain 50 I'm

3613
03:53:18,890 --> 03:53:19,610
just gonna grab that.

3614

At least there's hope in three.

We're gonna have to meet her.

3629
03:55:35,510 --> 03:55:37,620
I think they caught a live one.

3630
03:55:42,430 --> 03:55:43,210
There we go.

3631
03:55:47,010 --> 03:55:47,830
That was bad.

3632
03:55:52,430 --> 03:55:53,950
Wanna beat up her first.

3633
03:55:57,190 --> 03:55:59,490
Oh my god, it literally just misses her.

3634
03:55:59,650 --> 03:56:00,270
That's crazy.

3635
03:56:04,740 --> 03:56:05,740
There you go.

3636
03:56:11,570 --> 03:56:12,970
There, a Naga freezer too.

3637
03:56:13,110 --> 03:56:13,950
Oh, that was fast.

3638
03:56:14,170 --> 03:56:14,830
That's what you get.

3639
03:56:15,170 --> 03:56:15,490
Thank God.

3640
03:56:18,370 --> 03:56:19,150
But money!

3641
03:56:21,930 --> 03:56:22,430
Alright.

3642
03:56:23,790 --> 03:56:24,670
You're gonna buy it.

3643
03:56:24,730 --> 03:56:31,590
The bonus is, if you, your cast deals more damage, if you're
in blinding circles, the bonus is double.

3644
03:56:33,630 --> 03:56:34,150
Two?

3645
03:56:35,010 --> 03:56:37,210
For freeze lasting longer?

3646
03:56:37,430 --> 03:56:38,290
Or one?

3647
03:56:38,750 --> 03:56:39,590
Or three?

3648
03:56:40,450 --> 03:56:42,510
All three of them are pretty good.

3649
03:56:42,910 --> 03:56:42,910
Two?

3650
03:56:43,430 --> 03:56:43,710
All right.

3651
03:56:44,630 --> 03:56:49,250
I have to double check to make sure I'm not getting one guy
by the same guy.

3652
03:56:51,750 --> 03:56:52,010
All right.

3653
03:56:53,210 --> 03:56:54,530
Let's grab the shop.

3654
03:56:55,910 --> 03:56:57,670
I mean, I bought the thing I might as well.

3655
03:56:57,770 --> 03:56:58,830
Oh my god, cannot fish.

3656
03:56:58,990 --> 03:56:59,250
Oh, hey.

3657
03:56:59,750 --> 03:57:00,470
Is this food?

3658
03:57:01,510 --> 03:57:02,350
Oh, it's seeds.

3659
03:57:05,050 --> 03:57:07,450
All right, here we go.

3660
03:57:08,130 --> 03:57:08,510
Oh, nice.

3661
03:57:08,830 --> 03:57:09,330
Another one.

3662
03:57:10,430 --> 03:57:12,470
Your sprint flicks deals damage when it does.

3663
03:57:12,630 --> 03:57:16,230
Your damaging effects from Olympia are strong for each plus
three.

3664
03:57:16,310 --> 03:57:17,590
How many do I have?

3665
03:57:18,910 --> 03:57:22,510
Um, I don't even know how many I've talked to.

3666
03:57:22,890 --> 03:57:24,290
I can't tell.

3667
03:57:24,610 --> 03:57:25,650
I can't tell with this.

3668
03:57:25,770 --> 03:57:26,870
This is not very helpful.

3669
03:57:27,570 --> 03:57:32,110
Uh, one is good.

3670
03:57:33,090 --> 03:57:35,090
I see one or...

3671
03:57:37,030 --> 03:57:38,750
Two, you need that damage.

3672
03:57:38,910 --> 03:57:40,010
That is true, I do.

3673
03:57:41,950 --> 03:57:45,730
Yeah, I'll do two because I'm very poor in damage right now.

3674
03:57:47,910 --> 03:57:48,250
Oh.

3675
03:57:49,330 --> 03:57:50,370
I have...

3676
03:57:51,030 --> 03:57:52,930
Oh, all common bones gain rarity.

3677
03:57:53,910 --> 03:57:54,690
At least two.

3678
03:57:55,230 --> 03:57:56,430
Oh, I have two of all of them.

3679
03:57:56,790 --> 03:57:57,830
I have two on all of them.

3680
03:57:58,350 --> 03:57:59,170
That should be good.

3681
03:58:01,830 --> 03:58:02,350
Yeah.

3682
03:58:04,410 --> 03:58:05,250
Haboon awakened.

3683
03:58:07,450 --> 03:58:07,890
Getting nice.

3684
03:58:08,150 --> 03:58:09,090
And I got another upgrade.

3685
03:58:09,830 --> 03:58:11,570
Okay, a lot of them got upgraded too.

3686
03:58:11,710 --> 03:58:12,170
That's good.

3687
03:58:12,870 --> 03:58:14,250
Alright, this one I don't know.

3688
03:58:14,990 --> 03:58:17,100
I don't know how... I feel like...

3689
03:58:17,950 --> 03:58:19,970
I'm not very good with this weapon.

3690
03:58:20,670 --> 03:58:22,350
Kronos must have kicked him out again.

3691
03:58:26,310 --> 03:58:26,730
Jesus!

3692
03:58:29,590 --> 03:58:32,010
Yeah, no, I am definitely not very good with this one.

3693
03:58:37,120 --> 03:58:39,220
Are you, oh my god, did I dodge it?

3694
03:58:39,300 --> 03:58:40,160
I can't tell.

3695
03:58:43,610 --> 03:58:44,090
Okay.

3696
03:58:54,130 --> 03:58:54,570
It's fine.

3697
03:58:54,910 --> 03:58:56,250
This isn't who you are.

3698
03:58:58,410 --> 03:58:59,110
All these demons.

3699
03:59:00,170 --> 03:59:01,430
We'll grab heals right now.

3700
03:59:02,090 --> 03:59:04,250
Honestly, it might be better for me to grab heals.

3701
03:59:10,120 --> 03:59:10,400
Okay.

3702
03:59:13,100 --> 03:59:14,580
I need more damage.

3703
03:59:14,800 --> 03:59:15,540
I'm so weak.

3704
03:59:21,360 --> 03:59:23,780
I am actually so fucking weak right now.

3705
03:59:26,660 --> 03:59:27,860
That doesn't hit me, right?

3706
03:59:37,450 --> 03:59:38,790
Are you serious?

3707
03:59:38,890 --> 03:59:39,510
Okay, that's fine.

3708
03:59:42,270 --> 03:59:42,590
You know what?

3709
03:59:42,610 --> 03:59:44,630
I'll grab heals too, just for the sake of it.

3710
03:59:50,250 --> 03:59:51,770
Am I in this?

3711
03:59:52,850 --> 03:59:53,810
Get out!

3712
03:59:55,310 --> 03:59:55,830
Oh.

3713
03:59:57,490 --> 03:59:58,630
No, I'll just do all.

3714
03:59:59,230 --> 04:00:00,470
I'll just full heal.

3715
04:00:02,730 --> 04:00:02,970
Oh!

3716
04:00:06,570 --> 04:00:08,410
Yeah, we did it again.

3717
04:00:09,190 --> 04:00:12,590
This is boundless rage and hides for now his fangs.

3718
04:00:14,930 --> 04:00:17,390
All right, that has to be the best Cerberus run.

3719
04:00:17,490 --> 04:00:20,270
I will admit, that is the best Cerberus one I've done.

3720
04:00:20,730 --> 04:00:23,050
But it was the worst Hecate run I've ever done.

3721
04:00:26,990 --> 04:00:29,730

Alright, nice.

Yeah, I bought it.

3734
04:02:20,800 --> 04:02:22,000
I paid to win the chaos.

3735
04:02:22,200 --> 04:02:22,680
Oh, and a tier.

3736
04:02:23,240 --> 04:02:24,160
Oh, and another thing.

3737
04:02:24,280 --> 04:02:25,060
Oh, my God.

3738
04:02:25,280 --> 04:02:26,340
I'm going to rob chaos.

3739
04:02:28,320 --> 04:02:31,600
Like, I got so many chaos that he just doesn't want to talk
to me anymore.

3740
04:02:32,360 --> 04:02:34,340
Oh, wait, this is good?

This is good, right?

3742
04:02:37,560 --> 04:02:38,700
It's heroic.

3743
04:02:42,380 --> 04:02:43,300
That's me too.

3744
04:02:44,080 --> 04:02:45,580
I need more damage too.

3745
04:02:50,100 --> 04:02:51,420
It's really rough.

3746
04:02:53,600 --> 04:02:54,860
I can survive.

3747
04:02:56,200 --> 04:02:57,500
I can do it.

3748
04:02:58,760 --> 04:02:59,820
Oh my god, that's an encounter.

3749
04:03:02,080 --> 04:03:02,900
Please tell me.

3750
04:03:03,200 --> 04:03:05,160
No, it's not even an encounter.

3751
04:03:05,740 --> 04:03:06,320
It's not.

3752
04:03:07,400 --> 04:03:08,900
It's a Titan forever.

3761
04:04:14,540 --> 04:04:22,100
Wait, but how many times does it happen?

3762
04:04:22,360 --> 04:04:22,880
Three is good.

3763
04:04:24,900 --> 04:04:25,960
Three is for prophecy.

3764
04:04:26,200 --> 04:04:27,040
Three is nice.

3765
04:04:27,640 --> 04:04:28,360
Try three.

04:04:28,880 --> 04:04:30,000
Let's see how it goes.

3767
04:04:31,000 --> 04:04:31,700
What does it go?

3768
04:04:32,040 --> 04:04:32,260
Okay.

3769
04:04:33,160 --> 04:04:34,400
All right, we'll try that.

3770
04:04:35,300 --> 04:04:38,420
All right, let's hope we get all the side rooms as possible.

3771
04:04:42,060 --> 04:04:43,280
Okay, that's fine.

3772
04:04:44,300 --> 04:04:45,800
Okay, that's fine.

3773
04:04:45,920 --> 04:04:48,080
We sort of... Alright, there you go.

There you go.

3775
04:04:52,340 --> 04:04:52,700
Alright.

04:04:53,860 --> 04:04:55,360
Launch another one.

3777
04:04:57,000 --> 04:04:58,580
It's just all shocks.

3778
04:05:04,140 --> 04:05:05,900
Oh my god, I wanted to do something else.

3779
04:05:09,880 --> 04:05:10,520
That's five.

3780
04:05:15,600 --> 04:05:17,700
Oh my god, it's like moving to it too.

3781
04:05:17,780 --> 04:05:18,400
That's crazy.

3782
04:05:20,380 --> 04:05:20,620
What?

3783
04:05:20,980 --> 04:05:21,960
That hits me?

3784
04:05:23,360 --> 04:05:24,900
All right, please give me a side room.

3785
04:05:25,680 --> 04:05:26,100
Okay, nice.

Okay, we got a side room.

04:05:27,700 --> 04:05:28,260
That's good.

3788
04:05:31,120 --> 04:05:31,900
Yeah, I'm trying.

3789
04:05:32,340 --> 04:05:33,260
Oh, okay, that's fine.

3790
04:05:37,150 --> 04:05:37,590
Okay.

3791
04:05:42,110 --> 04:05:42,870
That's fine.

3792
04:05:43,590 --> 04:05:44,150
Oh, my God.

3793
04:05:44,370 --> 04:05:45,030
There's rats right now.

3794
04:05:45,090 --> 04:05:45,550
But no!

3795
04:05:45,790 --> 04:05:46,150
Oh, my God.

3796
04:05:46,190 --> 04:05:46,730
We're both residents.

3797
04:05:47,090 --> 04:05:47,090
Okay!

3798
04:05:47,310 --> 04:05:47,870
We're just...

3799
04:05:49,290 --> 04:05:51,210
I was like, bro, that's awkward.

3800
04:05:51,510 --> 04:05:52,330
That's a little awkward.

3801
04:05:54,650 --> 04:05:57,290
We're just looking at each other and be like, hmm.

3802
04:06:01,170 --> 04:06:01,590
Take.

3803
04:06:02,310 --> 04:06:03,130
Damn 20.

3804
04:06:03,410 --> 04:06:03,890
Winnership.

3805
04:06:04,030 --> 04:06:05,550
Whenever you take less.

3806
04:06:05,810 --> 04:06:07,030
Okay, I do not have six.

3807
04:06:07,430 --> 04:06:11,030
Unfortunately, I only have four, so I don't think that's
worth it.

3808
04:06:11,910 --> 04:06:12,670
Restore some.

3809
04:06:13,050 --> 04:06:15,110
Whenever you get resources, you spread.

3810
04:06:15,170 --> 04:06:16,090
I guess it's one.

3811
04:06:16,510 --> 04:06:18,510
I don't have six of this.

3812
04:06:18,570 --> 04:06:19,450
I have only four.

3813
04:06:20,830 --> 04:06:22,570
I don't think I'm going to get enough for it.

3814
04:06:22,650 --> 04:06:23,910
So I'm going to get one then.

3815
04:06:24,130 --> 04:06:24,430
Yeah.

3816
04:06:24,650 --> 04:06:26,290
I don't have it.

3817
04:06:26,950 --> 04:06:27,310
Oh, nice.

3818
04:06:27,430 --> 04:06:28,730
Oh, and then there's this too.

3819
04:06:29,730 --> 04:06:30,450
It's good.

3820
04:06:31,770 --> 04:06:32,310
All right.

3821
04:06:32,970 --> 04:06:33,790
Two more encounters.

3822
04:06:35,010 --> 04:06:37,250
I don't even remember what I'm encountering.

3823
04:06:37,970 --> 04:06:39,350
What I get from it.

3824
04:06:39,670 --> 04:06:41,870
Guys, I forgot already what I get from it.

3825
04:06:42,290 --> 04:06:43,090
It's been a while.

3826
04:06:44,190 --> 04:06:45,210
Oh, that's just awkward.

3827
04:06:50,390 --> 04:06:52,250
I mean, remember it's a cast.

3828
04:06:58,160 --> 04:06:58,580
Yeah.

3829
04:07:03,270 --> 04:07:03,950
All right, nice.

3830
04:07:06,350 --> 04:07:11,590
Well, I'll heal for it, just because I have this.

3831
04:07:13,290 --> 04:07:13,730
Yeah!

3832
04:07:14,890 --> 04:07:16,150
Oh, plus 60% damage.

3833
04:07:16,270 --> 04:07:16,990
Okay, I just got it.

3834
04:07:17,690 --> 04:07:18,250
That's good.

3835
04:07:19,750 --> 04:07:20,790
All right, how many do I have?

3836
04:07:20,890 --> 04:07:21,170
Five.

3837
04:07:21,570 --> 04:07:22,650
Oh, I can make it.

3838
04:07:26,350 --> 04:07:26,790
Okay.

3839
04:07:32,360 --> 04:07:33,200
What's this?

3840
04:07:39,030 --> 04:07:39,730
Grab this.

3841
04:07:40,910 --> 04:07:42,210
Then we'll grab this.

3842
04:07:42,590 --> 04:07:43,150
Alright, that's good.

3843
04:07:43,950 --> 04:07:44,610
Oh, hey, money!

3844
04:07:48,290 --> 04:07:49,490
Okay, I'm...

3845
04:07:49,490 --> 04:07:49,770
Whoops.

3846
04:07:51,650 --> 04:07:52,770
I accidentally missed.

3847
04:07:53,130 --> 04:07:53,850
That's okay.

3848
04:07:56,870 --> 04:07:57,290
Okay.

3849
04:07:58,150 --> 04:07:58,750
Nice.

3850
04:07:59,190 --> 04:08:00,210
Got the freeze in.

3851
04:08:02,970 --> 04:08:03,930
Oh, my God.

3852
04:08:03,970 --> 04:08:04,370
That's okay.

3853
04:08:05,210 --> 04:08:06,770
That should be the last one.

3854
04:08:07,490 --> 04:08:07,890
They're gone.

3855
04:08:08,750 --> 04:08:09,170
Alright.

3856
04:08:09,810 --> 04:08:10,210
That was...

3857
04:08:10,230 --> 04:08:11,470
thousand dollars.

3858
04:08:12,290 --> 04:08:12,850
Oh more.

3859
04:08:13,270 --> 04:08:14,270
Oh wait, that's a duo.

3860
04:08:14,530 --> 04:08:16,790
Wait, that was Hefany and Hefany.

3861
04:08:18,490 --> 04:08:18,750
What?

3862
04:08:19,090 --> 04:08:22,750
For free?

3863
04:08:25,250 --> 04:08:25,510
Oh!

3864
04:08:26,450 --> 04:08:26,450
I

3865
04:08:33,290 --> 04:08:35,310
take those.

3866
04:08:35,850 --> 04:08:36,150
Yay!

3867
04:08:37,230 --> 04:08:37,570
Oh.

3868
04:08:38,290 --> 04:08:38,850
Oh.

3869
04:08:38,850 --> 04:08:40,550
But neither will I take these line down.

3870
04:08:41,610 --> 04:08:42,350
Family requirements.

3871
04:08:45,770 --> 04:08:46,350
Oh, wait.

3872
04:08:46,630 --> 04:08:46,910
What?

3873
04:08:47,290 --> 04:08:47,570
Oh!

3874
04:08:47,970 --> 04:08:48,850
Oh, okay, never mind.

3875
04:08:49,290 --> 04:08:50,190
Oh, okay.

3876
04:08:51,090 --> 04:08:52,210
I thought, okay.

3877
04:08:53,550 --> 04:08:54,090
That's okay.

3878
04:08:56,070 --> 04:08:57,370
Oh, okay, okay.

3879
04:08:57,490 --> 04:08:58,210
I didn't realize.

3880
04:08:58,630 --> 04:08:59,130
Oh, okay.

3881
04:08:59,630 --> 04:09:00,090
Sorry, buddy.

3882
04:09:00,210 --> 04:09:00,670
Sorry, sorry.

3883
04:09:02,070 --> 04:09:03,950
What do you mean he's mad?

3884
04:09:04,930 --> 04:09:06,050
I didn't know.

3885
04:09:13,740 --> 04:09:14,660
Oh, my God.

3886
04:09:14,820 --> 04:09:15,780
It's so much damage.

3887
04:09:18,780 --> 04:09:19,660
Oh, my God.

3888
04:09:19,880 --> 04:09:21,140
He's just hammering.

3889
04:09:21,840 --> 04:09:22,320
Oh, my God.

3890
04:09:22,480 --> 04:09:22,920
How long?

3891
04:09:23,140 --> 04:09:24,860
Guys, how long do I have to live for?

3892
04:09:25,900 --> 04:09:26,600
This is bad.

3893
04:09:26,780 --> 04:09:27,560
This is actually so bad.

3894
04:09:31,320 --> 04:09:32,120
I actually...

3895
04:09:32,120 --> 04:09:32,420
No!

3896
04:09:32,920 --> 04:09:33,720
I tried to heal!

3897
04:09:35,160 --> 04:09:36,720
Oh my god, I actually tried to heal.

3898
04:09:36,840 --> 04:09:37,280
It didn't work.

3899
04:09:39,920 --> 04:09:40,960
Oh my god.

3900
04:09:43,680 --> 04:09:44,980
I actually tried to heal.

3901
04:09:45,060 --> 04:09:45,520
It didn't work.

3902
04:09:49,900 --> 04:09:50,500
Oh god.

3903
04:09:50,640 --> 04:09:51,060
I got the heals.

3904
04:09:51,140 --> 04:09:51,820
I got the heals off.

3905
04:09:57,610 --> 04:09:58,450
That was so scary.

3906
04:10:01,010 --> 04:10:02,130
Okay, that should be enough.

3907
04:10:02,550 --> 04:10:03,630
Oh, thank God.

3908
04:10:03,790 --> 04:10:04,890
Let's all just take a breath.

3909
04:10:08,470 --> 04:10:10,370
Yeah, no, I was panicking.

3910
04:10:11,110 --> 04:10:11,780
I don't even know.

3911
04:10:15,660 --> 04:10:16,020
Okay.

3912
04:10:21,400 --> 04:10:23,440
We don't have a lot of armor.

3913
04:10:23,640 --> 04:10:25,000
I feel like...

3914
04:10:25,000 --> 04:10:26,180
I feel like, too.

3915
04:10:26,760 --> 04:10:27,260
Yeah.

3916
04:10:27,780 --> 04:10:30,360
I didn't realize the enemies get harder.

3917
04:10:30,460 --> 04:10:32,760
The more side rooms I take.

3918
04:10:33,260 --> 04:10:34,660
Anyway, let's take...

3919
04:10:37,520 --> 04:10:38,100
Anyway.

3920
04:10:39,000 --> 04:10:40,360
Let's take that one.

3921
04:10:47,500 --> 04:10:48,920
I might do it.

3922
04:10:49,240 --> 04:10:51,160
I might be doing this to myself.

3923
04:10:53,920 --> 04:10:56,340
Potentially it might be on me.

3924
04:11:03,950 --> 04:11:04,550
Okay.

3925
04:11:09,040 --> 04:11:09,440
Oh my god.

3926
04:11:09,620 --> 04:11:11,200
I definitely need the heals though.

3927
04:11:15,040 --> 04:11:15,620
Okay, nice.

3928
04:11:20,360 --> 04:11:20,880
Jesus!

3929
04:11:23,280 --> 04:11:25,340

Two for the blast, you're right.

3935
04:11:47,390 --> 04:11:48,630
The blast is pretty important.

3936
04:11:48,870 --> 04:11:49,950

3980
04:17:18,560 --> 04:17:22,560
You spoke before about the consequences of the past, of your
own mistakes.

3981
04:17:23,100 --> 04:17:25,100
Yet this is how you choose to rectify them.

3982
04:17:25,840 --> 04:17:27,400
Your entire family is against you.

3983
04:17:29,020 --> 04:17:29,840
As ever.

3984
04:17:30,460 --> 04:17:34,120
The only difference now is there are even more of you all
falling in line.

3985
04:17:34,620 --> 04:17:37,880
You would excise me from my own family, then very well.

3986
04:17:38,480 --> 04:17:39,760
But this is the result.

3987
04:17:40,080 --> 04:17:41,280
You're going down, old man!

3988
04:17:41,760 --> 04:17:44,080
You don't want to rule the underworld or the surface, do
you?

3989
04:17:44,560 --> 04:17:45,380
Yeah, look at him.

3990
04:17:45,460 --> 04:17:46,600
He thinks he's got a chance.

3991
04:17:46,660 --> 04:17:48,920
And then this is the run he kills me

3992
04:17:54,900 --> 04:18:03,860
Whoa, that's gaslighting Whoa, this guy is an actual
narcissist Whoa

3993
04:18:08,160 --> 04:18:17,320

perfect because my kids ended up not being perfect That

4000
04:18:35,780 --> 04:18:36,540
All right, there you go.

4001
04:18:39,740 --> 04:18:40,320
Oh, my God.

4002
04:18:40,420 --> 04:18:41,220
I dodged the chest in hand.

4003
04:18:41,540 --> 04:18:42,380
He's like, no.

04:18:45,560 --> 04:18:46,460

That's really nice.

4009
04:18:57,100 --> 04:18:58,320
That follows him.

4010
04:18:59,100 --> 04:18:59,980
Oh my God.

4011
04:19:00,320 --> 04:19:00,480

04:20:35,710 --> 04:20:37,490
I messed up by...

4030
04:20:37,490 --> 04:20:38,470
I have too little HP.

4031
04:20:38,630 --> 04:20:38,850
No!

4032
04:20:40,770 --> 04:20:42,470
I knew I messed up somehow.

4033
04:20:45,610 --> 04:20:47,850
I just don't have enough HP for this.

4034
04:20:49,530 --> 04:20:50,350
Oh, my God.

4035
04:20:51,990 --> 04:20:52,470
No.

4036
04:20:53,330 --> 04:20:55,130
Oh, yes!

4037
04:20:55,730 --> 04:20:55,730

Super chat.

Thank you, thank you.

4042
04:21:03,770 --> 04:21:06,050
Her green chickens, me.

Oh, thank God for the dodge.

4044
04:21:10,910 --> 04:21:13,090
Oh, Demeter came in clutch.

4045
04:21:13,410 --> 04:21:15,030
A bit of feuds and snide remarks.

4046
04:21:17,330 --> 04:21:19,330
Dodge actually works.

4047
04:21:19,730 --> 04:21:20,530
Oh, yes.

4048
04:21:20,970 --> 04:21:22,410
This is the whole of it.

4049
04:21:22,970 --> 04:21:24,870
I may have denied it to you.

4050
04:21:25,370 --> 04:21:26,130
But I wasn't doing it.

4051
04:21:26,710 --> 04:21:44,210
punished never punished oh I see she just wanted to put on
the show yeah yeah I purpose guys I purposely died used up

4052
04:21:44,210 --> 04:21:52,430
all my all my fucking death defiances so to make it make it
more intense guys

4053
04:21:58,730 --> 04:22:05,370
Ozu, thank you for the vibe, gift of ships, thank you, thank
you, guys, see, I made it more intense, guys, for the

4054
04:22:05,370 --> 04:22:07,970
content, it's called showmanship.

4055
04:22:08,470 --> 04:22:10,630
Again, to the abyss of the subconscious.

4056
04:22:10,630 --> 04:22:12,470
All right, I have all the sand now.

4057
04:22:15,170 --> 04:22:16,970
Yeah, we don't want to make it too easy.

4058
04:22:21,410 --> 04:22:25,510
Night and darkness, guide me to my blood beyond the grasp of
time.

4059
04:22:30,290 --> 04:22:31,270
All right, off I go.

4060
04:22:32,450 --> 04:22:34,630
everything's under control yes

4061
04:22:45,120 --> 04:23:01,540
all right here I am what the fuck did you say about me
that's right whoa our duty besides father always says no

4062
04:23:01,540 --> 04:23:09,900
fighting in this house I didn't feel good about it either
and I couldn't help thinking about what you said I know you

4063
04:23:09,900 --> 04:23:17,700
were being honest with me about your concerns all this must
be so much to take in believe me i'm absorbing it as quickly

4064
04:23:17,700 --> 04:23:23,760
as i can we have the sinister grandfather who's resorted to
all out war against the rest of the family one way or

4065
04:23:23,760 --> 04:23:31,840
another he needs to be sought that's right and i've been
trained in how to stop him though unfortunately it requires

4066
04:23:31,840 --> 04:23:42,120
you to do some of the dirty work the worst of it in fact i
can understand why you would be reluctant So what do we do?

4067
04:23:42,560 --> 04:23:43,480
Say we proceed as planned.

4068
04:23:43,820 --> 04:23:45,960
I get Gaigaro's to you, you do something to it.

4069
04:23:46,200 --> 04:23:49,080
I use it to destroy Kronos in my time before he takes
control in yours.

4070
04:23:49,720 --> 04:23:51,080
Then everything would be alright.

4071
04:23:51,720 --> 04:23:53,300
Yeah, which is that easy.

4072
04:23:54,560 --> 04:23:55,740
Well, I assume so, yes.

4073
04:23:56,000 --> 04:23:59,080
We can't anticipate exactly what shall happen in a world
without time.

4074
04:23:59,380 --> 04:24:00,980
But it's existed in that state before.

4075
04:24:01,580 --> 04:24:03,440
And can't be worse than letting him prevail.

4076
04:24:05,400 --> 04:24:08,080
But if Kronos is gone, what happens to you?

4077
04:24:11,500 --> 04:24:19,080
dead no if cronos hadn't taken father's throne we'd be
together as a family he denied me a father a mother a

4078
04:24:19,080 --> 04:24:25,960
three-headed dog you and some evening he'll deny you that i
like how he's like the last person she names soon like an

4079
04:24:25,960 --> 04:24:30,060
afterthought like she's like dot dot dot oh you

4080
04:24:37,660 --> 04:24:41,640
the dog the dog has a higher ranking than her brother

4081
04:24:44,860 --> 04:24:47,340
I don't want to lose you either, Zagreus.

4082
04:24:47,520 --> 04:24:48,320
Oh, and you.

4083
04:24:48,980 --> 04:24:50,220
You and all the rest.

4084
04:24:54,120 --> 04:24:55,820
Normal sibling behavior.

4085
04:24:58,580 --> 04:25:00,240
I did one more run?

4086
04:25:04,090 --> 04:25:05,130
Oh my god.

4087
04:25:05,310 --> 04:25:06,950
I thought that was the last run.

4088
04:25:07,110 --> 04:25:09,830
He's like, don't worry, I'll have it for the next meeting.

4089
04:25:10,590 --> 04:25:12,190
What the fuck do you mean?

4090
04:25:12,590 --> 04:25:13,710
Return to Shadow now.

4091
04:25:15,770 --> 04:25:17,110
Oh my god.

4092
04:25:17,330 --> 04:25:18,330
Alright, we'll do a surface run.

4093
04:25:18,650 --> 04:25:20,030
We'll go back and forth.

4094
04:25:20,390 --> 04:25:23,010
Run it back.

4095
04:25:26,170 --> 04:25:29,350
Any new hauntings need evaluation or anything?

4096
04:25:31,670 --> 04:25:32,630
I'm fine.

4097
04:25:32,870 --> 04:25:33,990
It's just...

4098
04:25:33,990 --> 04:25:35,690
I think I've hit a bit of a slump as all.

4099
04:25:36,470 --> 04:25:37,010
Happens, right?

4100
04:25:37,650 --> 04:25:38,530
I'll get over it.

4101
04:25:39,310 --> 04:25:40,150
That'll be fine.

4102
04:25:40,410 --> 04:25:41,410
It'll be fine.

4103
04:25:42,290 --> 04:25:42,810
I'm fine.

4104
04:25:43,030 --> 04:25:45,490
I confess I feel a bit self-conscious that the fated
lizard...

4105
04:25:45,510 --> 04:25:54,150
is there for you and all to see some of the matters it
describes are rather personal if it's any comfort the

4106
04:25:54,150 --> 04:26:03,850
prophecies appear only to you oh so you just see a blank
list when you fulfill a prophecy I see it's like a sudden

4107
04:26:03,850 --> 04:26:12,830
realization we know our paths are intertwined to an extent
well may your sudden realizations connected to my actions

4108
04:26:12,830 --> 04:26:16,550
not be too embarrassing All right.

4109
04:26:17,190 --> 04:26:18,450
This wasn't on the list before.

4110
04:26:18,770 --> 04:26:19,290
Grab this.

4111
04:26:19,910 --> 04:26:20,450
That's it.

4112
04:26:20,750 --> 04:26:21,550
That's all I can grab.

4113
04:26:22,550 --> 04:26:23,530
That's fine.

4114
04:26:23,730 --> 04:26:24,250
Again.

4115
04:26:24,650 --> 04:26:25,210
Oh my god.

4116
04:26:25,370 --> 04:26:25,990

4143
04:28:11,310 --> 04:28:15,730
things when you have come so close to the completion of your
task, Milanoi?

4144
04:28:17,310 --> 04:28:20,390
Well, for one, we're on the verge of destroying time itself.

4145
04:28:21,250 --> 04:28:24,850
For all you've taught me, I've never fully understood the
repercussions this would have.

4146
04:28:26,210 --> 04:28:27,850
That's what all the gods say.

4147
04:28:27,870 --> 04:28:30,630
I cannot bear you such repercussions ere they come to pass.

4148
04:28:31,370 --> 04:28:34,890
Our charge, your charge, is to stop Kronos.

4149
04:28:35,390 --> 04:28:39,210
Whatever it takes, I trust you shall require no additional
reminder.

04:29:09,230 --> 04:29:15,110

least I can confirm they're accurate I'm preposterous that

wall with the spark oh so the more rooms they have the more

So you smack Kronos a good couple of times now.

No way around the city.

4186
04:33:09,680 --> 04:33:10,520

He's like a little lizard.

His sprint hit the first four you run into blast that
knocks.

4201

Oh my god, Hercules?

4212
04:34:45,480 --> 04:34:47,900
Your threat is duly noted, son of Zeus.

04:34:48,620 --> 04:34:51,440
I'm headed for the docks, but understand this city's sealed
shut.

04:34:58,600 --> 04:34:59,660
You're a demigod.

4218
04:34:59,880 --> 04:35:02,240
You're not even a real god, Hercules.

4219
04:35:04,040 --> 04:35:31,990
I'm daughter of Hades the dead yeah I'm a full god you're a

What does this mean?

4222
04:35:39,450 --> 04:35:41,730
No, you can't say that.

4223
04:35:48,110 --> 04:35:52,070
Yeah, but I'm a full-blooded god.

4224
04:35:53,410 --> 04:35:54,710
I don't understand this.

4225
04:35:55,630 --> 04:35:59,970
I mean, hammer, Poseidon.

4226
04:36:01,310 --> 04:36:03,190
I guess the moon?

4227
04:36:03,630 --> 04:36:04,970
I'll grab the hammer first.

4228
04:36:09,460 --> 04:36:11,320
Oh, it's like a map.

4229
04:36:18,130 --> 04:36:18,730
Alright.

4230
04:36:21,830 --> 04:36:22,260
Alright.

4231
04:36:23,700 --> 04:36:25,280
Got rid of him first.

4232
04:36:28,580 --> 04:36:28,740
Alright.

4233
04:36:28,920 --> 04:36:30,440
Oh, I didn't even see this house.

4234
04:36:34,450 --> 04:36:35,530
Alright, nice.

4235
04:36:37,750 --> 04:36:38,530
Hammer time.

4236
04:36:41,010 --> 04:36:43,010
He insulted me first!

4237
04:36:44,330 --> 04:36:45,190
He...

4238
04:36:45,190 --> 04:36:45,630
He's...

4239
04:36:45,650 --> 04:36:47,830
He insulted me first.

4240
04:36:48,670 --> 04:36:50,170
He said bad things.

4241
04:36:58,380 --> 04:37:00,400
It's not my fault.

4242
04:37:04,000 --> 04:37:06,920
But you took it too far.

4243
04:37:08,860 --> 04:37:10,760
It's not racist.

4244
04:37:11,100 --> 04:37:12,700
It's goddess, okay?

4245
04:37:14,120 --> 04:37:17,480
I'm only judging him because he's half a god.

4246
04:37:17,500 --> 04:37:18,300
God.

4247
04:37:22,600 --> 04:37:23,200
Vampiric.

4248
04:37:30,820 --> 04:37:32,620
Three is awesome.

4249
04:37:33,000 --> 04:37:33,840
I'll try three.

4250
04:37:34,900 --> 04:37:36,940
Let's move cast, though.

4251
04:37:39,240 --> 04:37:40,180
Something's changed.

4252
04:37:40,860 --> 04:37:41,860
Wait, was there a room?

4253
04:37:53,580 --> 04:37:54,220
Let's see.

4254
04:37:54,360 --> 04:37:55,060
We'll do the moon.

4255
04:37:55,880 --> 04:37:56,920
I can grab the moon.

4256
04:37:59,740 --> 04:38:00,820
Guys, Hercules...

4257
04:38:00,820 --> 04:38:01,540
Guys, guys, guys.

4258
04:38:02,060 --> 04:38:03,620
Hercules isn't even real.

4259
04:38:07,600 --> 04:38:08,960
He's real to me.

4260
04:38:09,700 --> 04:38:11,640
Guys, he's not even real!

4261
04:38:19,230 --> 04:38:21,370
He's making me a head to be like, He's real to me!

4262
04:38:22,550 --> 04:38:25,150
I call upon the moon and draw you down.

4263
04:38:26,130 --> 04:38:28,950
I ought to welcome you more formally to our world's surface.

4264
04:38:29,670 --> 04:38:32,630
They made a Disney movie about him.

4265
04:38:32,790 --> 04:38:33,430
He's real.

4266
04:38:35,470 --> 04:38:35,790
Oh, yeah.

4267
04:38:36,030 --> 04:38:38,530
They made a Disney movie about talking bears.

4268
04:38:38,830 --> 04:38:39,870
Is that real?

4269
04:38:43,070 --> 04:38:44,590
I'm gonna get it.

4270
04:38:45,530 --> 04:38:46,330
Oh, get it.

4271
04:38:47,170 --> 04:38:47,690
Total eclipse.

4272
04:38:48,330 --> 04:38:50,570
Total eclipse of my heart.

4273
04:38:52,230 --> 04:38:52,910
Yes.

4274
04:38:55,790 --> 04:38:56,810
All right.

4275
04:38:57,170 --> 04:38:57,730
Hestia, right?

4276
04:38:58,030 --> 04:38:58,770
We'll do Hestia.

4277
04:39:01,070 --> 04:39:03,750
Oh, there is a Zeus down there.

4278
04:39:06,610 --> 04:39:07,590
You want to get Hera?

4279
04:39:08,510 --> 04:39:09,370
Her Zeus?

4280
04:39:09,630 --> 04:39:09,770
Okay.

4281
04:39:10,350 --> 04:39:11,010
Wait, how many have?

4282
04:39:11,090 --> 04:39:12,010
We got three left.

4283
04:39:12,350 --> 04:39:13,690
Okay, we'll get Hera here.

4284
04:39:20,680 --> 04:39:21,780
We'll grab this now.

4285
04:39:25,360 --> 04:39:26,420
Oh yeah, there's money here too.

4286
04:39:27,100 --> 04:39:28,620
Oh my god, there's the thing.

4287
04:39:34,760 --> 04:39:35,100
Alright.

4288
04:39:37,320 --> 04:39:39,760
Oh no, I need mana regen for sure.

4289
04:39:40,360 --> 04:39:41,520
I knew I'm missing something.

4290
04:39:41,700 --> 04:39:43,740
I need mana regen so badly.

4291
04:39:50,370 --> 04:39:52,170
Yeah, I definitely need mana regen.

4292
04:39:53,570 --> 04:39:55,190
Where the fuck is the house?

4293
04:39:56,170 --> 04:39:57,110
Oh, there's no house.

4294
04:39:57,250 --> 04:39:58,350
Okay, they don't have homes.

4295
04:39:58,550 --> 04:39:59,030
That's good.

4296
04:40:03,700 --> 04:40:04,040
Okay.

4297
04:40:04,840 --> 04:40:05,700
Area clear.

4298
04:40:06,800 --> 04:40:08,260
Yeah, we need mana regen.

4299
04:40:08,440 --> 04:40:09,420
We don't have a lot of that.

4300
04:40:09,520 --> 04:40:12,520
I've incarnated recently decided to show up as she is
willing to do.

4301

04:42:57,740 --> 04:42:59,040
What is the genre?

4332
04:42:59,100 --> 04:43:00,700
Almost through.

4333
04:43:01,040 --> 04:43:02,480
Alright, Hestia.

4334
04:43:10,230 --> 04:43:11,330
Jesus Christ.

4335
04:43:12,930 --> 04:43:14,130
There you go.

4336
04:43:15,510 --> 04:43:16,950
MOBA, yeah, MOBA ink.

4337
04:43:17,550 --> 04:43:19,630
It's literally a MOBA right now.

4338
04:43:19,950 --> 04:43:22,450
Got a fucking prop, like, get on kill.

4339
04:43:28,260 --> 04:43:29,420
Actual bullshit.

4340
04:43:31,400 --> 04:43:33,080
Your soul be damned, traitor.

4341
04:43:33,920 --> 04:43:35,600
You're not supposed to be up here, right?

4342
04:43:36,220 --> 04:43:36,740
No.

4343
04:43:38,520 --> 04:43:39,940
I'm not supposed to touch grass.

4344
04:43:46,700 --> 04:43:48,360
This is so bad.

4345
04:43:48,520 --> 04:43:50,600
I'm literally not getting any mana regen.

4346
04:43:51,300 --> 04:43:55,360
Your foe perish in the blast of damage just ending
surrounding foes.

4347
04:43:56,020 --> 04:43:57,760
Your special leaves scorch.

4348
04:43:58,860 --> 04:43:59,380
I feel like...

4349
04:43:59,380 --> 04:44:00,800
Oh, Pia, thank you for the raid.

4350
04:44:00,900 --> 04:44:01,700
Thank you, thank you.

4351
04:44:01,700 --> 04:44:03,320
Oh, we have a good stream, Pia.

4352
04:44:04,360 --> 04:44:05,680
We're touching grass right now.

4353
04:44:05,700 --> 04:44:05,960
now.

4354
04:44:06,140 --> 04:44:08,540
We're on the surface because we can finally breathe O2.

4355
04:44:09,800 --> 04:44:10,440
What do we want?

4356
04:44:10,580 --> 04:44:12,140
One or three, right?

4357
04:44:15,740 --> 04:44:16,220
Three?

4358
04:44:16,760 --> 04:44:20,540
I don't know if one would... I don't use my special that
much.

4359
04:44:20,620 --> 04:44:21,280
I'm gonna do this.

4360
04:44:21,900 --> 04:44:22,260
Or dab.

4361
04:44:22,320 --> 04:44:24,060
I haven't found any extra rooms.

4362
04:44:24,160 --> 04:44:25,020
What the fuck?

4363
04:44:25,200 --> 04:44:27,400
These gods are so fucking stingy.

4364
04:44:28,040 --> 04:44:29,080
It's because I...

4365
04:44:30,800 --> 04:44:31,860
What the fuck?

4366
04:44:33,000 --> 04:44:34,380
What are you doing?

4367
04:44:35,240 --> 04:44:36,260
Oh, he's used this god.

4368
04:44:36,980 --> 04:44:37,180
Oh!

4369
04:44:41,370 --> 04:44:42,090
Bye.

4370
04:44:43,810 --> 04:44:45,130
They're just chilling.

4371
04:44:46,950 --> 04:44:47,110
Alright.

4372
04:44:47,870 --> 04:44:48,210
Alright.

4373
04:44:48,850 --> 04:44:50,070
Last one.

4374
04:44:50,530 --> 04:44:50,990
Hermes.

4375
04:44:51,390 --> 04:44:53,070
Hermes are Poseidon.

4376
04:44:55,210 --> 04:44:55,430
Many.

4377
04:44:55,490 --> 04:44:56,410
They're going to keep the ships.

4378
04:44:56,470 --> 04:44:57,390
They can thank you.

4379
04:44:59,650 --> 04:45:01,070
Or waste it?

4380
04:45:01,830 --> 04:45:03,610
No, they're just that.

4381
04:45:03,670 --> 04:45:04,330
They free money.

4382
04:45:06,970 --> 04:45:08,730
Guys, it's free money.

4383
04:45:12,630 --> 04:45:13,350
Double magic?

4384
04:45:13,830 --> 04:45:14,830
Should I do it?

4385
04:45:15,970 --> 04:45:17,230
Alright, double magic.

4386
04:45:17,650 --> 04:45:18,970
Rice, thank you for the...

4387
04:45:19,970 --> 04:45:20,970

04:45:21,350 --> 04:45:21,990

04:45:23,870 --> 04:45:25,050
Where did the fuck did that guy go?

4391
04:45:26,570 --> 04:45:28,230
Oh my god, he almost threw that at me.

4392
04:45:29,370 --> 04:45:31,270
Oh my god, I already used that all up.

4393
04:45:32,470 --> 04:45:34,230
Hell, he got us a lot of...

4394
04:45:34,230 --> 04:45:36,730
I gotta destroy this guy's house real quick.

4395
04:45:38,010 --> 04:45:38,570
That's right.

4396
04:45:40,070 --> 04:45:42,310
No more housing for you.

4397
04:45:43,230 --> 04:45:43,230
Magic.

4398
04:45:43,650 --> 04:45:43,650
Yeah.

4399
04:45:45,350 --> 04:45:48,050
Oh, thank God there's a fucking room now.

4400
04:45:51,270 --> 04:45:51,830
Alright, nice.

4401
04:45:53,030 --> 04:45:55,010
Still didn't fucking proc on kill.

4402
04:45:57,970 --> 04:45:59,170
Good job.

4403
04:45:59,330 --> 04:45:59,590
Alright.

4404
04:46:03,620 --> 04:46:05,220
Uh, is that everything?

4405
04:46:05,780 --> 04:46:06,880
Yeah, I killed everything.

4406
04:46:10,670 --> 04:46:11,750
Not to get out of here.

4407
04:46:12,990 --> 04:46:14,790
Oh, but yeah, it raised Thank you for the gift of ships.

4408
04:46:14,970 --> 04:46:15,530
Thank you.

4409
04:46:15,530 --> 04:46:15,890
Thank you.

4410
04:46:16,810 --> 04:46:17,650
The suspense.

4411
04:46:18,230 --> 04:46:21,370
Oh, grab the water.

4412
04:46:22,530 --> 04:46:23,350
Okay, shock time.

4413
04:46:24,790 --> 04:46:27,210
Oh, I missed the transform.

4414
04:46:27,390 --> 04:46:28,170
What's the transform?

4415
04:46:28,630 --> 04:46:29,370
The city at her back.

4416
04:46:29,730 --> 04:46:36,550
The princess of the dead heads toward a dismal pasture where
she senses that she is not exactly being watched.

4417
04:46:40,370 --> 04:46:42,070
Polyphemus must already know I'm here.

4418
04:46:44,510 --> 04:46:45,750
Get the cage?

4419
04:46:47,590 --> 04:46:48,230
What do you mean?

4420
04:46:49,830 --> 04:46:50,270
Oh!

4421
04:46:52,170 --> 04:46:52,610
Oh!

4422
04:46:56,210 --> 04:46:57,670
How do I do it make it better?

4423
04:47:01,290 --> 04:47:04,870
My blessing made it all that way on just a rickety old
wooden ferry boat.

4424
04:47:05,570 --> 04:47:07,810
Must be a litany of fire safety hazards there.

4425
04:47:08,210 --> 04:47:10,750
Although plenty of water near with which to put them out.

4426
04:47:11,670 --> 04:47:12,630
I'll get the chance again.

4427
04:47:12,710 --> 04:47:13,290
Okay, that's good.

4428
04:47:13,670 --> 04:47:14,690
Yeah, I didn't realize.

4429
04:47:15,090 --> 04:47:15,770
I missed it.

4430
04:47:19,430 --> 04:47:19,930
And Leaves.

4431
04:47:20,070 --> 04:47:20,890
Okay, two, right?

4432
04:47:25,150 --> 04:47:25,850
I do two.

4433
04:47:27,990 --> 04:47:28,670
I do.

4434
04:47:28,750 --> 04:47:29,390
I have a lot.

4435
04:47:29,610 --> 04:47:30,610
I have a lot right now.

4436
04:47:31,290 --> 04:47:32,190
Grab this and this.

4437
04:47:32,990 --> 04:47:33,730
I'll grab everything.

4438
04:47:34,610 --> 04:47:36,570
I am very low HP.

4439
04:47:36,850 --> 04:47:40,150
I don't think we're going to make it all the way to the end.

4440
04:47:40,450 --> 04:47:41,450
I have a feeling.

4441
04:47:43,730 --> 04:47:44,310
Oh, my God.

4442
04:47:44,370 --> 04:47:44,990
What the fuck?

4443
04:47:45,090 --> 04:47:46,810
They got the Vampirid shit, guys.

04:49:27,780 --> 04:49:28,860

I already forgot what I have.

Isn't that extra low?

4468
04:50:27,790 --> 04:50:29,510
That extra low for me?

4469
04:50:29,710 --> 04:50:31,970
God, these sheep are so stingy!

Where is my wood?

You have so much hair on you.

4476
04:50:55,360 --> 04:50:59,720

05:01:14,860 --> 05:01:16,060
I learned my lesson.

4655
05:01:16,220 --> 05:01:18,220
The last time I had that, the last time I had that, I didn't

05:02:34,520 --> 05:02:35,780
Oh my god, I have mana regen.

4664
05:02:36,120 --> 05:02:36,600
It's okay.

4665
05:02:37,000 --> 05:02:37,560
It's okay.

4666
05:02:37,620 --> 05:02:39,000
I don't think we're gonna make it far.

4667
05:02:39,400 --> 05:02:40,240
Anyway, guys.

4668
05:02:42,600 --> 05:02:43,400
I don't...

4669
05:02:44,060 --> 05:02:46,100
This might be a little rough here.

4670
05:02:46,440 --> 05:02:49,280
I'm gonna grab that tree branch before she fucking kills me.

4671
05:02:49,520 --> 05:02:50,560
How cute.

4672
05:02:50,760 --> 05:02:52,560
Old Cersei must have done that to you, yeah?

4673
05:02:52,980 --> 05:02:56,080
I've flown by her little island where she's doing all her
lunatic experiments.

4674
05:03:00,160 --> 05:03:01,780
Oh, she has a new dialogue for it.

4675
05:03:01,880 --> 05:03:03,900
I'm going to have only ice left in my water.

4676
05:03:03,920 --> 05:03:08,080
Even more we easily identified the work of an experienced
enchantress, but only to spawn our craft.

4677
05:03:10,260 --> 05:03:12,280
Your craft turns you into a walking joke.

4678
05:03:12,760 --> 05:03:13,640
I'm just pointing it out.

4679
05:03:14,440 --> 05:03:15,600
I hear you.

4680
05:03:15,840 --> 05:03:17,140
I'm going to grab this just in case.

4681
05:03:17,420 --> 05:03:18,880
Oh, I made it just in time.

4682
05:03:19,500 --> 05:03:19,900
There you go.

4683
05:03:22,520 --> 05:03:23,280
What the fuck?

4684
05:03:23,320 --> 05:03:23,940

05:04:03,900 --> 05:04:05,680
I need to stop getting a scorch.

4691
05:04:06,440 --> 05:04:07,600
Like, I literally can't see.

4692
05:04:07,800 --> 05:04:08,880
Plus 100 damage.

4693
05:04:09,060 --> 05:04:09,660

4694
05:04:10,260 --> 05:04:11,460
A fucking course.

4695
05:04:16,990 --> 05:04:18,270
Oh my god.

4696
05:04:18,350 --> 05:04:21,650
All her damage does red fucking shit, too.

4697
05:04:29,680 --> 05:04:30,360
Okay.

4698
05:04:33,100 --> 05:04:34,360
Alright, if that's 5.

4699
05:04:38,960 --> 05:04:39,840
That's fine.

4700
05:04:41,500 --> 05:04:42,440
Oh my god.

4701
05:04:42,680 --> 05:04:43,860
Of course that doesn't.

4702
05:04:48,980 --> 05:04:50,180
You're good.

4703
05:04:50,700 --> 05:04:51,100
No!

4704
05:04:53,860 --> 05:04:54,980
Guys, I might.

4705
05:04:55,300 --> 05:04:56,160
Oh, thank god.

4706
05:04:56,960 --> 05:04:58,400
Thank god that actually hits.

4707
05:05:09,830 --> 05:05:10,930
What does that say?

4708
05:05:11,430 --> 05:05:12,150
What does that say?

4709
05:05:15,700 --> 05:05:16,720
Oh my god.

4710
05:05:17,380 --> 05:05:17,960
Where is she?

4711
05:05:23,010 --> 05:05:24,050
Okay, that's fine.

4712
05:05:24,190 --> 05:05:24,770
Nice.

4713
05:05:25,250 --> 05:05:28,590
Oh, we lost one, but like it was gonna happen

4714
05:05:36,370 --> 05:05:46,970
Thank God We got the golden apple Now the climb oh my god

4715
05:05:46,970 --> 05:05:55,690
Thank fucking God Okay, this is where I grabbed the tooth
It's tooth tab.

4716
05:05:57,390 --> 05:05:58,930
We are not very healthy.

4717
05:05:59,350 --> 05:06:01,190
We have only 76 HP.

4718
05:06:01,410 --> 05:06:04,190
This is the least amount of help I've got for this run.

4719
05:06:04,490 --> 05:06:07,350
To the fort of the most sacred mountain of the gods.

4720
05:06:08,290 --> 05:06:09,690
A little bit of a climb.

4721
05:06:10,490 --> 05:06:11,290
Alright, Apako.

4722
05:06:12,930 --> 05:06:14,050
Oh god.

4723
05:06:14,470 --> 05:06:15,330
That's quite enough.

4724
05:06:17,890 --> 05:06:19,730
Alright, we're gonna...

4725
05:06:19,730 --> 05:06:21,850
Let's just stand behind our frog.

4726
05:06:25,430 --> 05:06:27,530
There we go.

4727
05:06:28,170 --> 05:06:32,630
This is the only thing we can do.

4728
05:06:33,630 --> 05:06:34,390
Uh...

4729
05:06:34,390 --> 05:06:35,050
Magic.

4730
05:06:35,430 --> 05:06:36,710
We still don't have regen.

4731
05:06:37,770 --> 05:06:38,710
Yeah, you know... Oh, hey.

4732
05:06:39,590 --> 05:06:39,850
Oh!

4733
05:06:40,910 --> 05:06:41,670
What?

4734
05:06:42,430 --> 05:06:43,810
That was an accident.

4735
05:06:44,450 --> 05:06:45,090
Oh, whoop.

4736
05:06:45,890 --> 05:06:48,110
Did not... whoopsie.

4737
05:06:51,290 --> 05:06:52,050
Okay.

4738
05:06:52,390 --> 05:06:52,810
Dennis.

4739
05:06:54,190 --> 05:06:55,250
All right, magic.

4740
05:06:58,450 --> 05:06:58,970
Oh, my God.

4741
05:06:59,290 --> 05:06:59,590
Thank God.

4742
05:06:59,750 --> 05:06:59,930
God.

4743
05:07:01,470 --> 05:07:02,110
Wait, what?

4744
05:07:04,490 --> 05:07:05,410
Oh, guys.

4745
05:07:05,810 --> 05:07:06,510
HP or Poseidon?

4746
05:07:07,930 --> 05:07:08,570
I forgot.

4747
05:07:08,810 --> 05:07:09,730
It makes me airdrop.

4748
05:07:11,710 --> 05:07:12,190
Yeah.

4749
05:07:13,450 --> 05:07:14,310
Oh, my God.

4750
05:07:14,370 --> 05:07:15,530
Why does it do this to me?

4751
05:07:15,610 --> 05:07:19,270
I feel like I really need HP, though.

4752
05:07:19,870 --> 05:07:20,910
Unless Poseidon.

4753
05:07:21,350 --> 05:07:22,190
Oh, I need HP.

4754
05:07:22,310 --> 05:07:23,450
I'm so low in HP.

4755
05:07:23,630 --> 05:07:24,010
Okay.

4756
05:07:24,190 --> 05:07:25,410
I'm going to attack on site.

4757
05:07:26,310 --> 05:07:26,970
Oh my god, he didn't win.

4758
05:07:27,290 --> 05:07:27,810
Okay, it's fine

4759
05:07:31,090 --> 05:07:31,590
It's okay.

4760
05:07:32,370 --> 05:07:36,510
No There's oh wait, I didn't eat that anyway.

4761
05:07:37,090 --> 05:07:45,750
I thought yeah That's fine Here we go.

4762
05:07:46,130 --> 05:07:46,930
I got the proc.

4763
05:07:48,810 --> 05:07:49,150
Oh, no.

4764
05:07:49,490 --> 05:07:49,890
Oh, no.

4765
05:07:50,310 --> 05:07:53,090
Oh, no Oh, no get it out.

4766
05:07:53,210 --> 05:07:56,610
No Yeah!

4767
05:07:56,910 --> 05:07:57,650
Oh shit!

4768
05:08:00,110 --> 05:08:01,990
Oh my god, is he still here?

4769
05:08:02,610 --> 05:08:03,610
Is he still here?

4770
05:08:05,910 --> 05:08:07,770
Is he still here, guys?

4771
05:08:09,570 --> 05:08:10,010
Okay.

4772
05:08:10,730 --> 05:08:11,490
He's gone, he's gone.

4773
05:08:11,610 --> 05:08:12,590
He can't hurt me no more.

4774
05:08:12,970 --> 05:08:14,530
He can't hurt me no more.

4775
05:08:15,990 --> 05:08:16,850
He's gone, guys.

4776
05:08:17,030 --> 05:08:17,450
Oh hey!

4777
05:08:17,870 --> 05:08:19,190
Another person to talk to.

4778
05:08:19,670 --> 05:08:20,170
That's new.

4779
05:08:22,230 --> 05:08:25,490
So I say, can't we just, you know, invite him over to a
feast?

4780
05:08:27,010 --> 05:08:30,370
Wait, is it the god of wine or party?

4781
05:08:31,310 --> 05:08:32,110
I forgot his name.

4782
05:08:35,050 --> 05:08:35,070
Whoa!

4783
05:08:37,910 --> 05:08:38,830
Hello, sir.

4784
05:08:39,050 --> 05:08:40,410
What a party.

4785
05:08:41,570 --> 05:08:42,870
Oh, my god.

4786
05:08:42,930 --> 05:08:43,850
It needs you, Freenos.

4787
05:08:45,990 --> 05:08:47,050
Rest easy now.

4788
05:08:47,670 --> 05:08:48,910
Oh, my god.

4789
05:08:49,310 --> 05:08:50,150
That isn't cool.

4790
05:08:50,190 --> 05:08:51,090
Oh, it is!

4791
05:08:53,650 --> 05:08:54,990
It is him.

4792
05:08:55,050 --> 05:08:56,130
It's the god of wine.

4793
05:08:57,550 --> 05:08:58,230
Damn.

4794
05:08:59,330 --> 05:09:01,450
Bro, the Greek guys don't know how to party.

4795
05:09:02,270 --> 05:09:04,370
Bro, he's sexy and he knows it.

4796
05:09:05,150 --> 05:09:08,350
That's literally the fucking thon.

4797
05:09:09,450 --> 05:09:11,310
It's from the 60 and I know it's on.

4798
05:09:15,530 --> 05:09:18,470
Bro, there's a cheetah in the party room.

4799
05:09:20,090 --> 05:09:22,990
Why is he hiding a gun on his feet?

4800
05:09:23,730 --> 05:09:23,730
Oh,

4801
05:09:27,140 --> 05:09:27,540
God.

4802
05:09:28,560 --> 05:09:29,760
He's stuffed up.

4803
05:09:29,780 --> 05:09:30,940
No, he's stuffed it.

4804
05:09:31,000 --> 05:09:31,800
Just isn't one of them.

4805
05:09:32,020 --> 05:09:32,560
What's the use?

4806
05:09:32,720 --> 05:09:35,260
We gods can't die, but we can live.

4807
05:09:37,220 --> 05:09:38,520
Your mountain is under siege.

4808
05:09:39,200 --> 05:09:40,440
He's like, I don't care.

4809
05:09:40,540 --> 05:09:43,160
I'm here to party.

4810
05:09:44,280 --> 05:09:46,900
More reasonable reason to raise a cup while we still can,
yeah?

4811
05:09:47,420 --> 05:09:48,280
Though I get it.

4812
05:09:48,660 --> 05:09:51,540
More like it's the nuclear lodge codes.

4813
05:09:52,760 --> 05:09:54,220
That's what's in the speedo.

4814
05:09:54,560 --> 05:09:55,840
Get a load of these.

4815
05:09:56,320 --> 05:09:57,960
Grants power when used.

4816
05:10:04,310 --> 05:10:05,130
Let's see.

4817
05:10:05,610 --> 05:10:09,610
Restore took damage in Oh.

4818
05:10:11,470 --> 05:10:14,670
Your moves inflicted hangover the first time they strike
foes.

4819
05:10:15,390 --> 05:10:15,390
Two.

4820
05:10:15,510 --> 05:10:16,810
I feel like two, right?

4821
05:10:21,420 --> 05:10:22,880
I'm dressed yellow.

4822
05:10:24,140 --> 05:10:25,640
Yeah, that is an elephant.

4823
05:10:26,260 --> 05:10:28,320
That's a long-ass elephant trunk.

4824
05:10:34,180 --> 05:10:34,740
That sucks.

4825
05:10:34,920 --> 05:10:35,920
I don't have enough nectar.

4826
05:10:36,060 --> 05:10:37,240
I didn't realize I'll need it.

4827
05:10:39,100 --> 05:10:39,980
Without partying.

4828
05:10:40,180 --> 05:10:42,240
Bro, these satyrs know how to party.

4829
05:10:44,160 --> 05:10:45,680
Oh, is it worth fighting Hera?

4830
05:10:46,620 --> 05:10:47,820
Guys, is it worth it?

4831
05:10:50,400 --> 05:10:51,900
Is the boss fight hard?

4832
05:10:52,320 --> 05:10:52,680
I forgot.

4833
05:10:52,800 --> 05:10:53,600
Oh, wait, I remember it.

4834
05:10:53,600 --> 05:10:54,700
No, I remember the boss fight.

4835
05:10:54,900 --> 05:10:56,820
Is it worth getting Hera or just get magic?

4836
05:10:58,080 --> 05:10:58,120
Hera?

4837
05:10:58,480 --> 05:10:58,740
All right.

4838
05:10:59,620 --> 05:11:00,380
It's a...

4839
05:11:00,380 --> 05:11:01,100
Oh, what?

4840
05:11:02,160 --> 05:11:03,200
Oh, what?

4841
05:11:05,400 --> 05:11:06,660
What is this?

4842
05:11:07,360 --> 05:11:07,620

It was not worth it.

4845
05:11:42,110 --> 05:11:42,610
Okay.

4846
05:11:45,090 --> 05:11:46,550
I just need to...

4847
05:11:46,550 --> 05:11:47,870
Yo, this boss fight sucks.

4848
05:11:49,230 --> 05:11:49,810
100%.

4849
05:11:51,810 --> 05:11:52,730
There we go.

4850
05:11:53,590 --> 05:11:54,930
Maybe I can...

4851
05:11:54,930 --> 05:11:55,250
There we go.

4852
05:11:55,370 --> 05:11:56,510
I locked in him in.

4853
05:11:57,150 --> 05:11:58,590
Yeah, just had so much armor.

4854
05:11:59,550 --> 05:12:00,810
Goodbye, death defiance.

4855
05:12:00,810 --> 05:12:05,690
I have to find Depth Defiance.

4856
05:12:07,390 --> 05:12:07,830
Okay, one.

4857
05:12:08,430 --> 05:12:09,490
Yeah, I'm getting rarity.

4858
05:12:09,870 --> 05:12:10,530
Okay, two.

4862
05:12:18,170 --> 05:12:19,030
Oh, shit.

4863
05:12:21,190 --> 05:12:22,490
Everything rarity.

4864
05:12:24,190 --> 05:12:24,890
Yeah, yo.

4865
05:12:25,070 --> 05:12:27,690
Um, we have one Depth Defiance left, guys.

4866
05:12:28,770 --> 05:12:29,210
Oh, my gosh.

4867
05:12:29,250 --> 05:12:29,770
Stop, stop.

4868
05:12:30,410 --> 05:12:31,990
Stop walking away.

4869
05:12:33,570 --> 05:12:34,010
Whoops.

4870
05:12:35,510 --> 05:12:35,790
It's bad.

4871
05:12:37,250 --> 05:12:37,530
There we go.

4872
05:12:37,610 --> 05:12:38,410
I got the 5 HP.

4873
05:12:38,570 --> 05:12:39,230
I needed that 5.

4874
05:12:42,110 --> 05:12:43,950
Okay, they should spawn in another one.

4875
05:12:44,090 --> 05:12:45,030
Oh no, it's the robots.

4876
05:12:45,190 --> 05:12:46,010
The robots are here.

4877
05:12:46,530 --> 05:12:48,190
The robot uprising is here now.

4878
05:12:48,610 --> 05:12:49,070
Oh no!

4879
05:12:51,010 --> 05:12:52,270
Oh my god, they're here.

4880
05:12:53,470 --> 05:12:54,010
There we go.

4881
05:12:56,710 --> 05:12:57,070
There we go.

4882
05:12:57,150 --> 05:12:58,150
I got the HP too.

4883
05:13:00,270 --> 05:13:01,350
More HP, please.

4884
05:13:02,630 --> 05:13:04,450
Uh, we'll get the Pob.

4885
05:13:07,750 --> 05:13:08,450

Okay, nice.

4889
05:13:17,630 --> 05:13:18,290
Broke his armor.

Okay.

That's good.

4892
05:13:23,960 --> 05:13:24,920
I have full HP now.

05:13:26,280 --> 05:13:27,520
That's good for me.

4894
05:13:33,710 --> 05:13:34,770
Oh, my God.

4895
05:13:35,070 --> 05:13:35,950
No, that's not good now.

4896
05:13:36,290 --> 05:13:37,250

4902
05:14:15,970 --> 05:14:17,010
Define intervention?

4903
05:14:20,730 --> 05:14:21,250
I...

4904
05:14:21,250 --> 05:14:21,830
Oh hey.

4905
05:14:23,310 --> 05:14:24,130
Wait, is that Athena?

4906
05:14:24,770 --> 05:14:25,110
Athena!

4907
05:14:27,370 --> 05:14:28,730
Oh my god, you're real!

4908
05:14:29,350 --> 05:14:31,090
I'm proud to welcome you to Olympus.

4909
05:14:31,530 --> 05:14:34,250
You know, you could have came here a bit earlier, but that's
okay.

4910
05:14:35,390 --> 05:14:36,150
That's okay.

4911
05:14:36,370 --> 05:14:40,810
I already... I killed 80% I killed 90% of them, but that's
okay.

4912
05:14:41,490 --> 05:14:42,110
I'll take it.

4913
05:14:43,110 --> 05:14:44,510
Now where can I direct my wrath?

4914
05:14:44,910 --> 05:14:47,130
Oh my god, I even, I am tired here.

4915
05:14:47,230 --> 05:14:49,610
I'm sound high pitched too.

4916
05:14:50,670 --> 05:14:52,110
Well met indeed, Malinoi.

4917
05:14:52,650 --> 05:14:56,230
The wretched titans armies have infiltrated our most sacred
grounds.

4918
05:14:56,730 --> 05:14:58,630
And then your wrath may be well spent.

4919
05:14:58,710 --> 05:15:00,710
Yeah, I just realized my voice is pitched tired too.

4920
05:15:01,390 --> 05:15:03,510
Where most of our family now takes refuge.

4921
05:15:05,030 --> 05:15:06,490
Oh my god, her shield does blink.

4922
05:15:10,790 --> 05:15:11,930
The palace of Zeus.

4923
05:15:12,530 --> 05:15:13,090
And what of you?

4924
05:15:13,910 --> 05:15:19,530

to me what the fuck because that is precisely what our

4925
05:15:19,530 --> 05:15:26,690
strategy requires for they aided your arrival did they not
now let us go our separate ways and may my blessing aid in

more now oh my god okay but you prime bro it's fine i'm okay

is fine actually it gives me a death to five

4928
05:15:47,510 --> 05:15:48,430
Should I flag?

4929
05:15:50,950 --> 05:15:52,650
Okay, no, three is huge.

4930
05:15:52,850 --> 05:15:53,490
No, we need that.

4931
05:15:54,950 --> 05:15:55,710
We don't.

4932
05:15:56,210 --> 05:15:56,650
Nice.

4933
05:15:56,870 --> 05:15:57,450
You know what?

4934
05:15:58,230 --> 05:15:59,090
Look at our magic.

4935
05:16:02,030 --> 05:16:03,710
Guys, look at our magic now.

4936
05:16:06,070 --> 05:16:07,650
Alright, um, which one?

4937
05:16:07,730 --> 05:16:08,590
One, two, or three?

4938
05:16:09,910 --> 05:16:11,370
We just go all in and blitz?

4939
05:16:11,870 --> 05:16:12,650
What, Matt?

4940
05:16:13,890 --> 05:16:14,930
Three is run saving?

4941
05:16:16,030 --> 05:16:18,050
Oh, you mean the next one, right?

4942
05:16:20,370 --> 05:16:21,290
Yeah, no, look at it.

4943
05:16:26,810 --> 05:16:29,870
Well, I feel like we're meeting new people, so we'll get
nectar now.

4944
05:16:31,190 --> 05:16:32,270
I don't think we need ash.

4945
05:16:32,390 --> 05:16:34,510
I mean, we'll get the materials, though.

4946
05:16:36,830 --> 05:16:38,070
Guys, ash or nectar?

4947
05:16:38,310 --> 05:16:39,790
I feel like we should get nectar just because...

4948
05:16:39,790 --> 05:16:41,910
We can always buy nectar, guys.

4949
05:16:41,950 --> 05:16:43,490
We can always buy nectar, though.

4950
05:16:44,250 --> 05:16:45,050
I think it's fine.

4951
05:16:49,680 --> 05:16:55,740

Guys, it's okay, we don't need it.

4955
05:17:23,720 --> 05:17:24,160
We don't need it.

4956
05:17:24,300 --> 05:17:25,640
We don't need mana regen.

4957
05:17:26,200 --> 05:17:27,040
Famous Lasper.

4958
05:17:27,180 --> 05:17:28,060
It's okay, we don't need it.

4959
05:17:28,220 --> 05:17:29,260
We don't need mana regen.

4960
05:17:31,480 --> 05:17:31,900
Oh.

4961
05:17:34,340 --> 05:17:35,180
18 Ash.

4962
05:17:36,720 --> 05:17:37,140
Oh, hammer.

4963
05:17:37,260 --> 05:17:38,020
Wait, hammer's good.

4964
05:17:39,260 --> 05:17:39,660
Hammer time.

4965
05:17:42,300 --> 05:17:43,300
Oh, god damn it.

4966
05:17:43,560 --> 05:17:44,580
That was an accident.

4967
05:17:47,600 --> 05:17:48,420
Oh, God.

4968
05:17:49,140 --> 05:17:49,620
Oh, God.

4969
05:17:50,660 --> 05:17:53,200
Oh, my God.

4970
05:17:53,500 --> 05:17:54,140
Okay, it's okay.

4971
05:18:00,790 --> 05:18:01,590
Hammer time.

4972
05:18:04,270 --> 05:18:05,830
Attacks hit two times, but you...

4973
05:18:05,830 --> 05:18:07,950
This would be... Okay, we have to get 30.

4974
05:18:08,230 --> 05:18:10,670
This would be so good, but I don't have...

4975
05:18:10,670 --> 05:18:11,890
I still don't have matter.

4976
05:18:12,090 --> 05:18:13,770
So we'll just get plus 30 damage.

4977
05:18:14,870 --> 05:18:15,350
Shop.

4978
05:18:17,230 --> 05:18:17,710
Hmm...

4979
05:18:20,370 --> 05:18:23,750
Does this, like, progress the room, guys?

4980
05:18:24,590 --> 05:18:26,150
Does this progress the room or not?

4981
05:18:26,710 --> 05:18:27,330
I don't know.

4982
05:18:27,990 --> 05:18:29,930
Because, like, will I get another shop if I go here?

4983
05:18:30,090 --> 05:18:30,510
Or no?

4984
05:18:34,030 --> 05:18:34,970
Oh, it both?

4985
05:18:35,090 --> 05:18:36,510
Okay, we'll get shopped then.

4986
05:18:40,030 --> 05:18:41,630
Yeah, we gotta spend the money.

4987
05:18:42,010 --> 05:18:42,810
The moolah.

4988
05:18:46,510 --> 05:18:46,930
Okay.

4989
05:18:49,510 --> 05:18:50,010
Oh!

4990
05:18:53,490 --> 05:18:55,090
They're all cast, the spy.

4991
05:18:56,310 --> 05:18:57,650
I might as well get this.

4992
05:18:59,030 --> 05:19:00,970
It's like some sort of mana region.

4993
05:19:01,730 --> 05:19:06,150
The majestic summit of Mount Olympus would be very much in
sight from here.

4994
05:19:06,890 --> 05:19:08,510
Were it not for the very dark.

4995
05:19:08,710 --> 05:19:10,150
At least I made it to him.

4996
05:19:10,550 --> 05:19:14,170
I don't know if I'll beat him, but I made it.

4997
05:19:15,390 --> 05:19:16,790
Okay, here we go.

4998
05:19:16,910 --> 05:19:19,190
Okay, this is gonna test us.

4999
05:19:19,190 --> 05:19:19,870
Ah, yes.

5000
05:19:21,370 --> 05:19:24,070
Resist all you like, yet the age of God shall end.

5001
05:19:25,890 --> 05:19:27,610
All right, we have two death defiances.

5002
05:19:28,550 --> 05:19:30,070
I don't think we're going to make it, but it's okay.

5003
05:19:30,630 --> 05:19:32,190
It's the thought that counts.

5004
05:19:34,570 --> 05:19:40,510
If I somehow gave you the impression that I'm interested in
your doomsaying and false prophecies, I assure you, I'm not.

5005
05:19:42,630 --> 05:19:45,550
Your disregard is the very reason you're no longer fit to
rule.

5006
05:19:46,170 --> 05:19:47,950
I know you'll never relinquish this mountain.

5007
05:19:48,750 --> 05:19:49,770
Fall with it, then.

5008
05:19:50,410 --> 05:19:50,750
All right.

5009
05:19:53,050 --> 05:19:53,930
Oh, my God.

5010
05:19:56,770 --> 05:19:57,370
Bitch!

5011
05:19:58,830 --> 05:19:59,890
Stupid eagle.

5012
05:20:00,670 --> 05:20:03,350
Oh my god, I hate the eagle so much.

5013
05:20:04,930 --> 05:20:05,530
What?

5014
05:20:06,890 --> 05:20:08,030
I dashed through.

5015
05:20:08,050 --> 05:20:09,630
I swear to god, guys, I dashed through it.

5016
05:20:09,830 --> 05:20:10,050
I swear.

5017
05:20:11,890 --> 05:20:13,430
I swear I dashed through it.

5018
05:20:15,470 --> 05:20:16,490
Oh my god.

5019
05:20:21,710 --> 05:20:22,630
Oh my god.

5020
05:20:23,130 --> 05:20:23,890
He's so scary.

5021
05:20:27,360 --> 05:20:29,140
Are you fucking kidding me?

5022
05:20:29,540 --> 05:20:30,520
It throws double.

5023
05:20:30,640 --> 05:20:32,320
Okay, that's cheating.

5024
05:20:32,960 --> 05:20:34,020
Oh my god, here we go.

5025
05:20:34,820 --> 05:20:35,880
Okay, bottom.

5026
05:20:36,120 --> 05:20:36,680

Are you fucking kidding me?

5031
05:21:04,270 --> 05:21:05,690
That should have been illegal.

5032
05:21:12,890 --> 05:21:13,290
Oh god.

5033
05:21:13,970 --> 05:21:14,730
Oh god, nothing.

5035
05:21:19,680 --> 05:21:20,740
Okay, it's fine.

05:23:36,810 --> 05:23:45,270

entertainment for your benefit is that all this is to you

5050
05:24:14,170 --> 05:24:21,350
then you jeopardize our continued existence just for a cheap
thrill Don't go acting like there wasn't part of you.

5051
05:24:21,470 --> 05:24:29,550
Yeah, oh now she's so friendly and now that you've had a
taste you want more don't you No, no, that's fine.

5052
05:24:29,930 --> 05:24:30,370
No, it's okay.

5053
05:24:30,450 --> 05:24:31,770
You can just leave and leave the apple.

5054
05:24:32,730 --> 05:24:34,510
Just leave the apple and that's fine.

5055
05:24:34,750 --> 05:24:35,990
Too bad we can't have it all.

5056
05:24:36,570 --> 05:24:37,250
You're all right?

5057
05:24:37,950 --> 05:24:38,390
No.

5058
05:24:39,050 --> 05:24:40,350
I got my ass beat.

5059
05:24:41,150 --> 05:24:44,230
Why can't Hestiest thing not be red?

5060
05:24:45,390 --> 05:24:46,290
Contain a moon map.

5061
05:24:46,430 --> 05:24:47,150
Okay, let's grab that.

5062
05:24:49,410 --> 05:24:50,570
She's kind of bad.

5063
05:24:50,890 --> 05:24:51,350
Don't.

5064
05:24:51,450 --> 05:24:51,690
Bad.

5065
05:24:53,890 --> 05:24:55,710
Don't make me get the spray bottle.

5066
05:25:03,010 --> 05:25:07,690
Alright, Rush, uh, sometimes contain a shrine of Hermes.

5067
05:25:07,970 --> 05:25:09,090
I mean, that sounds nice.

5068
05:25:17,830 --> 05:25:23,770
Yeah, I'm saying how the fuck did the eagle befriended him?

5069
05:25:24,850 --> 05:25:26,690
His old job was to eat his liver.

5070
05:25:27,010 --> 05:25:27,690
See, plain enough.

5071
05:25:28,550 --> 05:25:31,470
For one, he wants his vengeance on Lord Uncle Zeus and the
rest.

5072
05:25:31,650 --> 05:25:34,370
And for another, he's a titan himself.

5073
05:25:36,130 --> 05:25:40,430
I am a titaness as well as his sister Selene, lest you
forget.

5074
05:25:41,670 --> 05:25:45,030
Our lineage need not dictate our loyalties or principles.

5075
05:25:45,970 --> 05:25:47,450
They bonded at work.

5076
05:25:48,890 --> 05:25:52,190
You know, he fed the ego something else that wasn't living.

5077
05:25:53,710 --> 05:25:55,890
It was just like, whoa.

5078
05:25:56,930 --> 05:26:01,030
Oh, okay, that was literally the last one.

5079
05:26:01,650 --> 05:26:04,590
Oh, yeah, I do not have a lot of psyche left.

5080
05:26:05,670 --> 05:26:06,550
Hey, here you go.

5081
05:26:07,690 --> 05:26:08,930
Eris stands against us.

5082
05:26:09,810 --> 05:26:10,810
Just as I need my destination.

5083
05:26:11,090 --> 05:26:13,410
Yeah, he started Uber Eats ordering for the Eager.

5084
05:26:13,550 --> 05:26:14,610
I'll do much of the talking.

5085
05:26:17,230 --> 05:26:18,990
Imagine my surprise.

5086
05:26:19,730 --> 05:26:20,730
So what to do?

5087
05:26:21,190 --> 05:26:25,030
Can't kick her out since all children of Nix are welcome
here.

5088
05:26:25,630 --> 05:26:27,290
Whose ever bright idea that was?

5089
05:26:27,870 --> 05:26:30,150
Maybe give her some more second chances.

5090
05:26:31,650 --> 05:26:32,110
Wait, am I?

5091
05:26:32,170 --> 05:26:33,590
Why am I giving her second chance?

5092
05:26:33,670 --> 05:26:34,510
It's like, fuck that bitch.

5093
05:26:34,810 --> 05:26:35,790
This opposes us.

5094
05:26:36,330 --> 05:26:38,010
Now that one hurts, God is.

5095
05:26:38,710 --> 05:26:40,850
Amongst us mortals, he was quite popular.

5096
05:26:41,270 --> 05:26:42,030
Beloved even.

5097
05:26:42,630 --> 05:26:44,030
Oh, oh yeah, that's why.

5098
05:26:44,130 --> 05:26:45,270
He was when I gave fire.

5099
05:26:45,430 --> 05:26:46,710
And that's why they punished him.

5100
05:26:48,370 --> 05:26:51,190
And in so doing, he violated the will of Olympus.

5101
05:26:52,130 --> 05:26:53,730
Supposedly, he has the gift of foresight.

5102
05:26:54,270 --> 05:26:57,050
He ought to have anticipated the consequences of his
disobedience.

5103
05:26:57,630 --> 05:26:59,650
Yeah, she must be punished for being an asshole.

5104
05:26:59,850 --> 05:27:01,050
What makes you think you did not?

5105
05:27:01,650 --> 05:27:03,530
All the more reason we admired him.

5106
05:27:04,190 --> 05:27:06,850
He knew the cost of what he did for us and paid it
willingly.

5107
05:27:07,590 --> 05:27:08,730
So I choose to think.

5108
05:27:09,230 --> 05:27:10,610
But all that's in the past.

5109
05:27:11,330 --> 05:27:13,950
If he's thrown in with Kronos now, he's lost his way.

5110
05:27:15,650 --> 05:27:16,570
He's done this.

5111
05:27:16,670 --> 05:27:17,650
Let's pick this up.

5112
05:27:18,810 --> 05:27:19,130
Is there anything?

5113
05:27:19,250 --> 05:27:19,690
Oh, wait.

5114
05:27:20,050 --> 05:27:21,070
Got a plan that.

5115
05:27:21,810 --> 05:27:22,850
And we got a plan that.

5116
05:27:24,890 --> 05:27:26,430
All right, we have a cat now.

5117
05:27:26,990 --> 05:27:28,730
We abducted somebody's cat.

5118
05:27:29,170 --> 05:27:30,390
No, I still don't have enough.

5119
05:27:31,650 --> 05:27:32,230
pet again?

5120
05:27:32,650 --> 05:27:33,370
I don't remember.

5121
05:27:33,790 --> 05:27:34,830
Where the fuck is the thing?

5122
05:27:34,990 --> 05:27:35,850
Oh, there she is.

5123
05:27:36,150 --> 05:27:36,670
Aww!

5124
05:27:38,030 --> 05:27:39,250
She's so cute.

5125
05:27:39,610 --> 05:27:40,190
Look at her.

5126
05:27:40,630 --> 05:27:41,090
Aww.

5127
05:27:42,670 --> 05:27:43,790
That's cute.

5128
05:27:46,670 --> 05:27:47,230
Alright.

5129
05:27:47,670 --> 05:27:48,890
Sprint by Tolan.

5130
05:27:49,010 --> 05:27:50,130
She will attack.

5131
05:27:50,990 --> 05:27:51,750
What does she do?

5132
05:27:51,750 --> 05:27:52,570
What does he do?

5133
05:27:55,550 --> 05:27:57,030
Wait, what is the amphibian?

5134
05:27:57,110 --> 05:27:58,450
What is the frog special?

5135
05:28:00,630 --> 05:28:01,050

Of your grass for your arena.

Uh...

5148
05:29:32,610 --> 05:29:34,110

Is that Hecatee on the top?

5162
05:30:00,360 --> 05:30:01,220
I can't tell.

5163
05:30:02,120 --> 05:30:02,840
Is that Hecatee?

5164
05:30:06,620 --> 05:30:07,560
No, that's Erys.

5165
05:30:07,640 --> 05:30:07,780

05:30:54,120 --> 05:30:54,640
There she is.

5178
05:30:54,820 --> 05:30:54,940
Okay.

5179
05:30:55,080 --> 05:30:58,400
I was gonna be like, where the fuck did my cat go?

5180
05:31:01,680 --> 05:31:03,580
Okay, we gotta dig this.

5181
05:31:11,650 --> 05:31:13,170
Okay, I gotta go fast here.

5182
05:31:15,770 --> 05:31:16,810
Alright, hard time.

5183
05:31:17,730 --> 05:31:18,850
We gotta go so fast.

5184
05:31:22,940 --> 05:31:25,720
Oh my god, I'm so not used to using this.

5185
05:31:26,940 --> 05:31:28,380
I'm not good with this weapon.

5186
05:31:29,260 --> 05:31:29,680
Money time.

5187
05:31:32,980 --> 05:31:34,760
Okay, we don't need transform yet.

5188
05:31:39,570 --> 05:31:40,610
Okay, that's good.

5189
05:31:43,950 --> 05:31:44,470
Nice.

5190
05:31:45,130 --> 05:31:46,810
God, this weapon is so...

5191
05:31:46,810 --> 05:31:48,230
It feels so slow.

5192
05:31:49,630 --> 05:31:51,070
Why are you just sleeping?

5193
05:31:52,870 --> 05:31:54,490
Can you help?

5194
05:31:57,390 --> 05:31:59,230
Bro, he's the cat's just sleeping!

5195
05:31:59,430 --> 05:32:00,870
Why won't he help me?

5196
05:32:03,570 --> 05:32:05,130
I'm so confused!

5197
05:32:08,450 --> 05:32:09,390
Wait, where is the last one?

5198
05:32:09,550 --> 05:32:10,030
Okay, there she is.

5199
05:32:15,130 --> 05:32:15,290
Okay.

5200
05:32:18,590 --> 05:32:19,070
Nice.

5201
05:32:20,830 --> 05:32:22,270
Where is my cat?

5202
05:32:23,570 --> 05:32:25,050
Where is my cat?

5203
05:32:26,750 --> 05:32:27,370
We're here!

5204
05:32:32,230 --> 05:32:46,170
why is she sleeping hello we're up against Prometheus it's
more of a support makes him quite an elusive one I guess the

5205
05:32:46,170 --> 05:32:55,690
titan of foresight that's just doing cat maybe against the
gods who punished him I will wake her up he's in my way I

5206
05:32:56,290 --> 05:33:02,470
know precisely what you mean though if he really knows the
future wouldn't he choose the winning side careful with him

5207
05:33:02,470 --> 05:33:14,470
sister all right your specials may deal critical damage but
you prime 40 enemy damage you deal may be critical hmm one

5208
05:33:14,470 --> 05:33:28,370
two one or two we take oh or three plus 13 percent chance oh
my god they're all really good this is 14 percent chance

5209
05:33:33,410 --> 05:33:34,190
I don't know.

5210
05:33:34,330 --> 05:33:35,190
They're all really good.

5211
05:33:35,370 --> 05:33:36,070
One or three.

5212
05:33:39,130 --> 05:33:40,290
It was for everything.

5213
05:33:40,490 --> 05:33:42,030
That's true, but it's 4%.

5214
05:33:42,030 --> 05:33:43,270
Is 4% worth it?

5215
05:33:46,410 --> 05:33:46,830
Hmm.

5216
05:33:50,610 --> 05:33:51,810
Alright, I'll make it cast.

5217
05:33:52,390 --> 05:33:54,030
I feel like I do cast a lot.

5218
05:33:54,170 --> 05:33:55,050
Yeah, I'm gonna do cast.

5219
05:33:56,170 --> 05:33:56,430
Yeah.

5220
05:33:56,850 --> 05:33:57,530
Then it's yours.

5221
05:33:57,690 --> 05:33:58,670
I cast a lot.

5222
05:33:58,970 --> 05:34:00,130
Let's do this again sometime.

5223
05:34:00,290 --> 05:34:01,410
We're grabbing this.

5224
05:34:06,850 --> 05:34:08,290
Oh my god, wake up!

5225
05:34:09,430 --> 05:34:09,750
Wake!

5226
05:34:11,530 --> 05:34:14,290
Oh my god, wake the fuck up.

5227
05:34:16,990 --> 05:34:18,130
There you go.

5228
05:34:18,150 --> 05:34:20,150
We've got a situation starting to unfold.

5229
05:34:20,850 --> 05:34:22,890
A big crevasse opened up at the base of the mountain.

5230
05:34:23,290 --> 05:34:24,470
And something's in there.

5231
05:34:24,890 --> 05:34:25,650
Something big.

5232
05:34:25,830 --> 05:34:27,090
And it's breathing.

5233
05:34:28,650 --> 05:34:30,730
What the fuck is up there?

5234
05:34:31,190 --> 05:34:32,110
Oh, two times.

5235
05:34:32,250 --> 05:34:32,410
Wait.

5236
05:34:34,210 --> 05:34:34,730

You've been getting anywhere, my friend.

5243
05:35:15,030 --> 05:35:17,630
I know that whatever you do, you do not give up.

5244
05:35:18,290 --> 05:35:21,450
But I don't rightly know how close you are to what you mean
to achieve.

5245
05:35:22,110 --> 05:35:23,590
I'm closer than before, but how much...

5246
05:35:23,590 --> 05:35:24,770
I made it to the surface.

5247
05:35:25,490 --> 05:35:25,910
I'm getting there.

5248
05:35:26,270 --> 05:35:27,310
The silk has been of so much help.

5249
05:35:28,890 --> 05:35:31,070
I'm glad it has and figured that it would.

5250
05:35:32,990 --> 05:35:42,370

05:36:52,930 --> 05:36:58,530
I'm so sad.

5258
05:36:59,070 --> 05:37:00,390

The cat is leaving.

5264
05:37:17,270 --> 05:37:18,010
This should help.

5265
05:37:20,410 --> 05:37:22,150
All right, we'll grab this.

5266
05:37:26,080 --> 05:37:27,480
Okay, guys, which is harder?

5267

Which is harder?

5268
05:37:30,020 --> 05:37:30,920
I need a note.

5269
05:37:31,940 --> 05:37:32,780
Which one?

5270
05:37:37,600 --> 05:37:38,620
Grab Zeus last?

5271
05:37:38,720 --> 05:37:40,260
Okay, I gotta deal with pep.

5272
05:37:40,580 --> 05:37:42,660
Like, I have been so fucking scary.

5273
05:37:44,800 --> 05:37:46,060
But I guess Zeus is scarier.

5274
05:37:49,910 --> 05:37:50,210
Okay.

5275
05:37:51,310 --> 05:37:53,170
I do have a lot of armor.

5276
05:37:54,990 --> 05:37:56,090
Based on your...

5277
05:37:57,870 --> 05:37:59,970
Both were, like, super annoying.

5278
05:38:00,310 --> 05:38:00,470
Okay.

5279
05:38:00,690 --> 05:38:01,270
Two or three.

5280
05:38:01,370 --> 05:38:03,190
I mean, they're all pretty bad, but two or three.

5281
05:38:04,190 --> 05:38:05,270
Three could be two?

5282
05:38:06,370 --> 05:38:07,190
Two, okay.

5283
05:38:07,410 --> 05:38:07,690
Okay.

5284
05:38:07,690 --> 05:38:08,670
The forge of the heavens.

5285
05:38:08,870 --> 05:38:09,090
Yeah.

5286
05:38:09,710 --> 05:38:11,770
You were defiant, speaking you, young lady.

5287
05:38:11,950 --> 05:38:14,130
One would be wise to hold in check

5288
05:38:17,270 --> 05:38:20,050
All right, Lord uncle, I met no offense.

5289
05:38:21,130 --> 05:38:23,950

Wait, that's a nice transform.

5313
05:40:07,800 --> 05:40:09,060
Until they expire.

5314
05:40:09,240 --> 05:40:10,560
After you take damage, unranic damage.

5315
05:40:10,660 --> 05:40:11,080
Oh, two.

5316
05:40:13,180 --> 05:40:14,320

Yeah, I don't need that.

5324
05:40:53,900 --> 05:40:54,880
I got more magic.

5325
05:40:59,030 --> 05:41:00,130
Wait, that regen sucks?

5326
05:41:00,290 --> 05:41:01,010

05:41:16,730 --> 05:41:17,990
Found something new to...

5335
05:41:18,010 --> 05:41:29,590
work a chill sweat through the air as you approach and
seasonably cold and perhaps it is as Demeter desires you go

I feel like there's no...

5418
05:47:01,750 --> 05:47:03,790
I wouldn't need anything else other than the hammer.

5419
05:47:04,350 --> 05:47:05,950
Honestly, okay, guys.

5420
05:47:06,230 --> 05:47:07,890
Come out of your goddamn shell.

5421
05:47:10,510 --> 05:47:10,970

5422
05:47:10,970 --> 05:47:11,470

05:47:19,670 --> 05:47:20,510
Oh, this is...

5427
05:47:20,510 --> 05:47:21,750

5428
05:47:24,430 --> 05:47:24,950
Okay.

5429
05:47:27,290 --> 05:47:28,330
There you go.

5430
05:47:30,010 --> 05:47:31,170
And we'll grab this too.

5431
05:47:32,530 --> 05:47:33,090
Where's the hammer?

5432
05:47:34,950 --> 05:47:35,850
Oh, there it is.

5433
05:47:38,070 --> 05:47:40,170
Specials have plus 15 and deal of damage.

5434
05:47:40,350 --> 05:47:44,510
Your dash strike also fires your special three times at once
in a fan pattern?

5435
05:47:45,710 --> 05:47:46,470
Wait, what?

5436
05:47:47,150 --> 05:47:48,670

5437
05:47:48,770 --> 05:47:49,130

Oh.

5439
05:47:53,130 --> 05:47:55,470
Does it mean, does it automatically fire?

5440
05:47:57,050 --> 05:47:58,530
Does it automatically fire?

5441
05:47:58,830 --> 05:47:59,850
Oh, it does!

5442
05:48:00,210 --> 05:48:01,110
Oh, shit!

5443
05:48:01,310 --> 05:48:02,350
Wait, that's crazy!

5444
05:48:03,450 --> 05:48:04,550
Oh, God, no.

5445
05:48:04,850 --> 05:48:05,750

5448
05:48:08,130 --> 05:48:08,470
No!

5449
05:48:08,870 --> 05:48:09,770
Wait, I have a cat!

5450
05:48:11,930 --> 05:48:12,770
Oh, my God.

5451
05:48:13,070 --> 05:48:13,730
It's cat time.

5452
05:48:14,930 --> 05:48:15,150
Oh, my God.

5453
05:48:15,350 --> 05:48:15,550
Wake up.

5454
05:48:15,730 --> 05:48:16,130
Wake up.

5455
05:48:19,250 --> 05:48:20,290
Wake up.

5456
05:48:20,570 --> 05:48:20,770
Wake up.

5457
05:48:23,270 --> 05:48:25,110
I'm so scared of this rat.

5458
05:48:26,210 --> 05:48:27,770
I'm so scared.

5459
05:48:30,010 --> 05:48:31,830
Oh my god, he's so strong.

5460
05:48:32,410 --> 05:48:34,010
He's so strong.

5461
05:48:35,910 --> 05:48:37,090
Oh my god, where's my cat?

5462
05:48:37,530 --> 05:48:38,230
Wake up.

5463
05:48:39,090 --> 05:48:40,010
Wake up.

5464
05:48:40,250 --> 05:48:41,630
Oh my god, there he goes.

5465
05:48:42,510 --> 05:48:43,330
Oh my god.

5466
05:48:47,310 --> 05:48:48,430
Oh, where is he?

5467
05:48:48,890 --> 05:48:50,110
Oh, where is he?

5468
05:48:52,150 --> 05:48:52,550
Thank God.

5469
05:48:53,710 --> 05:48:54,150
Uh-oh.

5470
05:48:57,290 --> 05:48:58,370
God's what a monster.

5471
05:49:00,410 --> 05:49:02,090
He is definitely a menace.

5472
05:49:04,590 --> 05:49:07,490
Your taxiomer damage, your cast inflicts...

5473
05:49:07,490 --> 05:49:07,830
Wait!

5474
05:49:08,070 --> 05:49:08,470
Freeze!

5475
05:49:09,790 --> 05:49:12,130
I get freeze and it expands.

5476
05:49:12,390 --> 05:49:13,150
That's good, right?

5477
05:49:13,290 --> 05:49:14,170
One is better than three?

5478
05:49:16,790 --> 05:49:18,250
I hate that mouse too.

5479
05:49:18,870 --> 05:49:19,650
Yeah, I don't know.

5480
05:49:20,710 --> 05:49:21,790
Because it's like...

5481
05:49:23,470 --> 05:49:24,410
Yeah, cast.

5482
05:49:24,510 --> 05:49:25,250

5483
05:49:25,490 --> 05:49:25,690
Yay!

5484
05:49:28,210 --> 05:49:28,690
Alright.

5487
05:49:39,030 --> 05:49:39,630
That's good.

5488
05:49:39,710 --> 05:49:40,910
We actually got...

5489
05:49:42,390 --> 05:49:43,510
We got a good one.

5490
05:49:44,110 --> 05:49:45,770
We got the echo too for it.

5491
05:49:46,230 --> 05:49:47,790
Because I was stuck between those three.

5492
05:49:52,160 --> 05:49:52,580
There you go.

5493
05:49:52,660 --> 05:49:53,620

Attacks and special deals.

5520
05:52:37,280 --> 05:52:39,660

05:52:53,740 --> 05:52:54,980
God, wake up my cat.

5531
05:52:55,580 --> 05:53:00,240
Yeah, that's me!

5532
05:53:00,760 --> 05:53:01,060
Yeah!

5533
05:53:01,720 --> 05:53:01,980
Yeah!

5534
05:53:01,980 --> 05:53:05,300
One day, we'll get our own big security team to take care of
us.

5535
05:53:05,300 --> 05:53:05,780
That's me.

5536
05:53:07,620 --> 05:53:09,300
I have little choice.

5537
05:53:09,400 --> 05:53:10,940
Here to cancel another concert!

5538
05:53:11,360 --> 05:53:11,820
Yeah!

5539
05:53:11,900 --> 05:53:13,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5540
05:53:13,560 --> 05:53:18,100
I'm like that guy, that party-crasher guy that everyone's
afraid of right now.

5541
05:53:18,780 --> 05:53:26,920
That like, he literally, like, all the fucking celebrities
have, like, increased security for that one party-crasher,

5542
05:53:27,040 --> 05:53:27,280
man.

5543
05:53:27,780 --> 05:53:28,220
That's me.

5544
05:53:28,300 --> 05:53:28,860
I'm him.

5545
05:53:29,660 --> 05:53:35,560
Literally the guy went to the Lady Gaga concert with a
mustache and, like, fucking sunglasses or some shit.

5546
05:53:35,920 --> 05:53:36,460
And a wig.

5547
05:53:36,500 --> 05:53:37,780
And he still got found.

5548
05:53:38,540 --> 05:53:40,980
So do your worst, lady.

5549
05:53:43,360 --> 05:53:44,780
That was crazy.

5550
05:53:44,960 --> 05:53:46,280
Where's my fucking cat?

5551
05:53:47,540 --> 05:53:48,920
What the fuck?

5552
05:53:49,940 --> 05:53:50,920
Wait, where's my cat?

5553
05:53:51,060 --> 05:53:51,700
Oh, there she is.

5554
05:53:53,280 --> 05:53:53,900
Oh, what the...

5555
05:53:54,860 --> 05:53:56,980
Okay, I never used this cat before.

5556
05:54:06,120 --> 05:54:06,580
Alright.

5557
05:54:08,280 --> 05:54:08,880
Oh, my God.

5558
05:54:08,940 --> 05:54:09,520
I have to go away.

5559
05:54:09,860 --> 05:54:10,620
I have to leave now.

5560
05:54:17,220 --> 05:54:18,320
Where is he sleeping?

5561
05:54:18,460 --> 05:54:19,920
I'm trying to... Wake up!

5562
05:54:25,210 --> 05:54:30,610
Oh my god, the backstab does nothing there I just realized
Where is he?

5563
05:54:30,810 --> 05:54:31,130
Wake up!

5564
05:54:32,510 --> 05:54:33,150
Wake up!

5565
05:54:33,350 --> 05:54:35,010
There you go.

5566
05:54:40,270 --> 05:54:40,770
Oh my god.

5567
05:54:45,280 --> 05:54:46,060
Okay, it's fine.

5568
05:54:47,940 --> 05:54:49,160
Oh my god, that was not fine.

5569
05:54:49,840 --> 05:54:51,200
That's not fine.

5570
05:54:56,540 --> 05:54:57,200
Bless her.

5571
05:55:01,450 --> 05:55:01,790
Okay.

5572
05:55:04,750 --> 05:55:05,510
It's okay.

5573
05:55:06,430 --> 05:55:07,550
It's no longer okay.

5574
05:55:07,650 --> 05:55:08,170
Where's my cat?

5575
05:55:09,010 --> 05:55:10,430
Where the fuck is my cat?

5576
05:55:11,850 --> 05:55:15,170
Like, I'm just trying to find my goddamn cat.

5577
05:55:15,410 --> 05:55:15,850
There he is.

5578
05:55:24,110 --> 05:55:24,650
Okay.

5579
05:55:25,170 --> 05:55:26,370
I got her, though.

5580
05:55:32,210 --> 05:55:32,830
Okay, I got it.

5581
05:55:33,510 --> 05:55:34,430
I got C still.

5582
05:55:35,510 --> 05:55:35,730
Whrrr.

5583
05:55:37,870 --> 05:55:38,870
Alright, nice.

5584
05:55:39,530 --> 05:55:40,830
Got five in him again.

5585
05:55:43,490 --> 05:55:45,590
Jesus Christ, okay.

5586
05:55:48,450 --> 05:55:48,970
Cut!

5587
05:55:52,650 --> 05:55:53,930
Okay, there we go.

5588
05:55:55,610 --> 05:55:55,950
Oh!

5589
05:55:59,860 --> 05:56:01,320
Lost it, catchy song.

5590
05:56:02,320 --> 05:56:02,720
There we go.

5591
05:56:03,120 --> 05:56:03,120
Yeah!

5592
05:56:03,860 --> 05:56:04,920
Oh, I got the nightmare too.

5593
05:56:05,000 --> 05:56:06,780
You're more like, I don't know.

5594
05:56:07,380 --> 05:56:08,720
Do you think I could do...

5595
05:56:08,720 --> 05:56:11,300
Do you think I could do the thing for...

5596
05:56:14,760 --> 05:56:15,280
For...

5597
05:56:18,130 --> 05:56:19,490
For like the grandpa?

5598
05:56:20,010 --> 05:56:20,730
Think that's possible?

5599
05:56:22,170 --> 05:56:23,030
Which one would help?

5600
05:56:23,270 --> 05:56:24,350
Wait, I don't get death defiance?

5601
05:56:25,350 --> 05:56:26,330
Wait, you stole my...

5602
05:56:26,330 --> 05:56:28,810
Oh, it's because I fucking accidentally used it!

5603
05:56:30,390 --> 05:56:30,870
Okay.

5604
05:56:31,830 --> 05:56:32,930
Oh my god.

5605
05:56:34,670 --> 05:56:35,870
I heard I accidentally...

5606
05:56:36,410 --> 05:56:37,750
I accidentally used my tooth.

5607
05:56:38,430 --> 05:56:39,670
God fucking damn it.

5608
05:56:39,710 --> 05:56:39,910
Okay.

5609
05:56:40,610 --> 05:56:40,910
It's okay.

5610
05:56:40,990 --> 05:56:44,490
I technically have three death defiance because I got my cat
with me.

5611
05:56:45,770 --> 05:56:46,250
Yeah.

5612
05:56:47,870 --> 05:56:49,330
All right, let's see if we can grab this run.

5613
05:56:49,450 --> 05:56:50,270
I think we can do it.

5614
05:56:50,350 --> 05:56:51,170
I think it's possible.

5615
05:56:52,570 --> 05:56:53,990
My damage is pretty strong.

5616
05:56:57,580 --> 05:56:59,200
All right, grab this.

5617
05:57:00,440 --> 05:57:02,360
Okay, I have moon.

5618
05:57:02,540 --> 05:57:03,160
We'll grab moon first.

5619
05:57:03,300 --> 05:57:04,160
We actually have no moon.

5620
05:57:05,320 --> 05:57:05,920
I just realized.

5621
05:57:06,100 --> 05:57:06,540
Wake up.

5622
05:57:06,700 --> 05:57:07,480
Wake up.

5623
05:57:08,100 --> 05:57:09,820
I'm always telling him to wake up.

5624
05:57:10,760 --> 05:57:11,080
Please.

5625
05:57:11,540 --> 05:57:12,840
Please wake up, cat.

5626
05:57:15,620 --> 05:57:16,740
Oh my god, you serious?

5627
05:57:17,060 --> 05:57:17,680
That hurt me?

5628
05:57:21,280 --> 05:57:21,640
Okay.

5629
05:57:21,660 --> 05:57:23,280
All right, nice.

5630
05:57:26,870 --> 05:57:27,290
Oh.

5631
05:57:28,490 --> 05:57:31,250
This one vow that may rise above the rest.

5632
05:57:31,970 --> 05:57:34,810
It is my charge as I of night to bear it witness.

5633
05:57:35,150 --> 05:57:42,210
Should you choose to speak this vow of rivals, discover the
extent of it, and overcome your strongest foes.

5634
05:57:42,510 --> 05:57:42,770
Okay.

5635
05:57:43,230 --> 05:57:44,270
I can do that.

5636
05:57:44,570 --> 05:57:45,610
Please make your choice.

5637
05:57:47,550 --> 05:57:47,950
All right.

5638
05:57:48,210 --> 05:57:49,190
Together we shine.

5639
05:57:49,390 --> 05:57:50,730
We get to summon a minion.

5640
05:57:51,430 --> 05:57:51,930
There we go.

5641
05:57:52,410 --> 05:57:53,270
We got a little Medusa.

5642
05:57:56,250 --> 05:57:57,290
Uh, heftime.

5643
05:58:01,000 --> 05:58:02,500
Please don't give me an echo here.

5644
05:58:02,580 --> 05:58:03,920
I don't know if there's another thing.

5645
05:58:04,740 --> 05:58:06,480
It would be very sad.

5646
05:58:11,000 --> 05:58:11,420
Oh, yeah.

5647
05:58:11,520 --> 05:58:12,480
Let's hope there's no...

5648
05:58:14,460 --> 05:58:16,360
I'm just hoping that God...

5649
05:58:19,320 --> 05:58:19,980
Okay, nice.

5650
05:58:22,480 --> 05:58:25,020
Okay, I'm gonna grab this before I claim it.

5651
05:58:25,360 --> 05:58:26,600
Just in case.

5652
05:58:30,040 --> 05:58:31,980
I don't feel so strong, though.

5653
05:58:34,400 --> 05:58:36,380
Your damage and attack deal more damage for each.

5654
05:58:36,560 --> 05:58:37,460
I have four.

5655
05:58:38,000 --> 05:58:38,660
I have four.

5656
05:58:40,040 --> 05:58:40,820
I think that's good.

5657
05:58:40,980 --> 05:58:42,760
I have four, so I have a lot of attacks.

5658
05:58:44,360 --> 05:58:44,820
The meter.

5659
05:58:45,020 --> 05:58:46,440
The meter or Apollo chat.

5660
05:58:47,000 --> 05:58:47,680
Which is better?

5661
05:58:49,380 --> 05:58:51,360
Since I have time, I actually have to...

5662
05:58:52,620 --> 05:58:53,940
I have to, like, pause it.

5663
05:59:02,000 --> 05:59:03,160
Apollo and Grandma.

5664
05:59:03,880 --> 05:59:04,500
There's a fish.

5665
05:59:05,400 --> 05:59:06,160
Oh, there's a fish.

5666
05:59:06,500 --> 05:59:07,300
No, that's not a fish.

5667
05:59:08,200 --> 05:59:09,060
Where's my fish?

5668
05:59:09,920 --> 05:59:10,460
Oh, there's a fish.

5669
05:59:14,980 --> 05:59:16,200
I got tears.

5670
05:59:16,300 --> 05:59:17,400
Why are they all sad?

5671
05:59:18,740 --> 05:59:20,560
Why are all my fishes sad?

5672
05:59:23,720 --> 05:59:25,180
I'm like concerned.

5673
05:59:26,220 --> 05:59:28,020
All my fishes are so sad.

5674
05:59:30,020 --> 05:59:30,960
Oh my god.

5675
05:59:31,980 --> 05:59:32,660
I need a cat.

5676
05:59:33,560 --> 05:59:37,140

Get him out of here, too.

5707
06:02:11,810 --> 06:02:13,970
Maybe it was a bad idea to get the cat.

5708
06:02:17,950 --> 06:02:18,610
All right.

5709
06:02:21,670 --> 06:02:25,150

06:02:28,290 --> 06:02:31,010
D plus... Am I getting hit right now?

5712
06:02:31,290 --> 06:02:31,810
What's hitting?

5713
06:02:31,890 --> 06:02:32,170
Okay.

5714
06:02:32,630 --> 06:02:33,290
Oh my god.

5715
06:02:34,070 --> 06:02:35,010
Oh my god.

5716
06:02:35,050 --> 06:02:36,210
Okay, we'll grab that.

5717
06:02:38,410 --> 06:02:39,930
I hope I got the right item.

5718
06:02:40,070 --> 06:02:42,410
I was too busy trying to figure out what was hitting me.

5719
06:02:44,830 --> 06:02:45,690
Where's the hammer?

5720
06:02:51,720 --> 06:02:52,580
Oh, it's over here.

5721
06:02:52,660 --> 06:02:54,620
Oh my god, it's so fucking far.

5722
06:02:54,720 --> 06:02:54,980
Stuck.

5723
06:02:57,340 --> 06:02:58,120
Oh, God.

5724
06:02:58,580 --> 06:02:58,880
Wake up.

5725
06:02:59,060 --> 06:02:59,580
Wake up.

5726
06:02:59,940 --> 06:03:00,220
Wake up.

5727
06:03:02,340 --> 06:03:03,300
Wake up.

5728
06:03:03,620 --> 06:03:05,840
Wake up.

5729
06:03:10,500 --> 06:03:12,020
Oh, my God.

5730
06:03:12,520 --> 06:03:12,520
Okay.

5731
06:03:13,680 --> 06:03:13,680
Okay.

5732
06:03:14,460 --> 06:03:14,860
Okay.

5733
06:03:18,140 --> 06:03:19,040
There we go.

5734
06:03:23,240 --> 06:03:24,100
Your tax deal.

5735
06:03:24,400 --> 06:03:25,160
Tracking votes.

5736
06:03:25,360 --> 06:03:26,480
Your tax are 35.

5737
06:03:26,680 --> 06:03:28,000
Oh, they're all pretty good.

5738
06:03:28,880 --> 06:03:29,720
Lolly, thank you for the super chat.

5739
06:03:29,740 --> 06:03:30,160
Thank you, thank you.

5740
06:03:30,160 --> 06:03:30,600
Thank you, thank you.

5741
06:03:30,640 --> 06:03:32,500
Doki, you ripped them under the natural environment.

5742
06:03:32,660 --> 06:03:33,080
Can't even breathe.

5743
06:03:33,300 --> 06:03:37,860
Would they not look sad that you were the super chat that
you think?

5744
06:03:38,360 --> 06:03:39,420
I would say two.

5745
06:03:40,180 --> 06:03:40,540
Yeah.

5746
06:03:41,260 --> 06:03:42,200
Master is always good.

5747
06:03:43,500 --> 06:03:45,140
Maybe I'll bump into Echo again.

5748
06:03:45,260 --> 06:03:46,400
Maybe I'll give me another Echo.

5749
06:03:47,600 --> 06:03:47,800
Nope.

5750
06:03:49,800 --> 06:03:50,360
Oh.

5751
06:03:51,180 --> 06:03:53,580
I mean, that's Moon Hermes.

5752
06:03:53,720 --> 06:03:54,240
Yeah, you know what?

5753
06:03:54,240 --> 06:03:55,200
That's a lot of.

5754
06:03:56,000 --> 06:03:56,760
That's a lot.

5755
06:03:59,620 --> 06:04:00,220
Oh my god.

5756
06:04:00,320 --> 06:04:01,120
I'm Rainbow now.

5757
06:04:01,960 --> 06:04:02,860
Lucky you.

5758
06:04:03,300 --> 06:04:05,480
Who said that?

5759
06:04:06,840 --> 06:04:07,760
Oh my god, where is she?

5760
06:04:08,460 --> 06:04:09,860
Where is she?

5761
06:04:11,420 --> 06:04:12,260
I'm scared.

5762
06:04:14,400 --> 06:04:16,560
I don't trust her.

5763
06:04:20,020 --> 06:04:22,440
Like, what is she doing here?

5764
06:04:25,400 --> 06:04:27,620
I don't trust her.

5765
06:04:32,700 --> 06:04:33,280
Okay, nice.

5766
06:04:36,920 --> 06:04:37,500
All right.

5767
06:04:38,260 --> 06:04:38,960
She's back.

5768
06:04:41,400 --> 06:04:41,500
Oh!

5769
06:04:42,640 --> 06:04:43,180
That's three?

5770
06:04:43,280 --> 06:04:43,980
Oh, I have three!

5771
06:04:46,500 --> 06:04:48,000
You don't even know unless you take damage.

5772
06:04:48,260 --> 06:04:52,420
If you deal with my until you take down, you take more and
more and more for you're getting this.

5773
06:04:53,020 --> 06:04:56,020
Out of your cast rapidly to deal damage near it.

5774
06:04:56,360 --> 06:04:56,920
Ooh, two.

5775
06:04:57,020 --> 06:04:57,600
Self-healing.

5776
06:04:58,600 --> 06:04:59,700
The force of fire.

5777
06:04:59,840 --> 06:05:01,120
Yeah, self-healing is good.

5778
06:05:01,820 --> 06:05:04,000
I'm gonna grab this first before I talk to her.

5779
06:05:04,080 --> 06:05:04,880
I don't trust her.

5780
06:05:06,580 --> 06:05:07,720
I wanted this, right?

5781
06:05:14,380 --> 06:05:15,180
Hey, this is different.

5782
06:05:22,730 --> 06:05:23,810
I'll get to the end.

5783
06:05:27,630 --> 06:05:27,990
Yeah.

5784
06:05:29,810 --> 06:05:31,950
Oh, pretty much sucks, so I need to get to the end.

5785
06:05:36,730 --> 06:05:39,010
Also lost here in these fields, I guess.

5786
06:05:39,510 --> 06:05:44,030
Trade you a map or something if I had one, but you wouldn't
have been able to afford it.

5787
06:05:44,430 --> 06:05:46,170
So I'd use it to get out of here myself.

5788
06:05:47,950 --> 06:05:49,870
I don't know if I could kill Prometheus, yeah.

5789
06:05:50,990 --> 06:05:52,790
Pathways seem to shift from night to night.

5790
06:05:53,610 --> 06:05:56,630
I've been able to make use of the Golden Bows scattered
about at least.

5791
06:05:57,050 --> 06:05:58,050
What about you?

5792
06:05:59,070 --> 06:06:00,170
The Golden Bows.

5793
06:06:00,910 --> 06:06:03,110
Had no idea those did anything but look all sad.

5794
06:06:03,110 --> 06:06:05,050
I need a charge that would actually that...

5795
06:06:06,650 --> 06:06:08,050
That I can cat like throw.

5796
06:06:08,910 --> 06:06:09,650
That can chuck.

5797
06:06:11,950 --> 06:06:12,730
You give.

5798
06:06:12,890 --> 06:06:13,190
Oh.

5799
06:06:17,180 --> 06:06:18,640
Yeah, I'll take that.

5800
06:06:19,400 --> 06:06:20,120
Fair is fair.

5801
06:06:20,620 --> 06:06:21,300
I have money.

5802
06:06:23,300 --> 06:06:23,940
Okay.

5803
06:06:24,480 --> 06:06:24,680
Okay.

5804
06:06:26,220 --> 06:06:28,880
Your special deals more damage and inflicts freeze.

5805
06:06:29,180 --> 06:06:29,280
Oh!

5806
06:06:29,980 --> 06:06:30,460
One!

5807
06:06:31,100 --> 06:06:31,420
Right?

5808
06:06:33,540 --> 06:06:37,940
It is a scam, but like, I'll take it.

5809
06:06:40,800 --> 06:06:41,440
Um...

5810
06:06:41,440 --> 06:06:42,220
More armor?

5811
06:06:42,300 --> 06:06:43,180
Yeah, but it's eight.

5812
06:06:43,320 --> 06:06:45,180
Eight is nothing, I feel like.

5813
06:06:45,540 --> 06:06:47,060
It is barely anything.

5814
06:06:48,340 --> 06:06:49,420
Not that good.

5815
06:06:50,020 --> 06:06:52,820
A gift from the earth.

5816
06:06:52,840 --> 06:06:54,140
all right

5817
06:06:57,330 --> 06:07:05,370

5820
06:07:30,660 --> 06:07:32,040
That's a very tall order.

5821
06:07:34,300 --> 06:07:34,320
Alright.

5822
06:07:36,080 --> 06:07:37,340
What are my chances again?

5823
06:07:37,460 --> 06:07:37,880
Days?

5824
06:07:38,280 --> 06:07:38,280
Right?

5825
06:07:39,020 --> 06:07:40,800
Oh wait, except for dodge and days.

5826
06:07:41,040 --> 06:07:41,800
I have to go one.

5827
06:07:41,880 --> 06:07:42,040
Yeah.

5828
06:07:42,340 --> 06:07:43,080
That's, yeah.

5829
06:07:43,440 --> 06:07:45,580
No, I'm not close to either.

5830
06:07:48,100 --> 06:07:50,320
No, we're guys, we're not very close.

5831
06:07:51,560 --> 06:07:52,980
To any of those.

5832
06:07:54,300 --> 06:07:55,600
I'm ready for you.

5833
06:07:58,300 --> 06:07:58,860
Unfortunately.

5834
06:08:00,680 --> 06:08:02,020
I would love to beat.

5835
06:08:08,190 --> 06:08:09,170
Okay, that's fine.

5836
06:08:11,610 --> 06:08:13,830
Oh my god, that's a lot of pimples on the ground.

5837
06:08:16,170 --> 06:08:18,330
Okay, we gotta get to the end game here.

5838
06:08:20,770 --> 06:08:22,070
I'm gonna try and head to the end.

5839
06:08:22,210 --> 06:08:23,350
I should be able to get out, I think.

5840
06:08:25,150 --> 06:08:26,150
Is that money?

5841
06:08:27,230 --> 06:08:28,850
Uh, we gotta go to shop.

5842
06:08:30,730 --> 06:08:31,030
Oh!

5843
06:08:32,270 --> 06:08:32,670

Okay, go in there.

Okay.

5852
06:09:23,540 --> 06:09:24,680
Jesus Christ.

5853
06:09:26,360 --> 06:09:27,080
Okay.

5854
06:09:28,020 --> 06:09:28,800
Cat, it's time.

06:09:29,480 --> 06:09:30,360
God damn it, cat.

06:09:35,790 --> 06:09:36,770
Okay, that's okay.

5857
06:09:39,810 --> 06:09:41,370
We just gotta get this guy.

5858
06:09:43,110 --> 06:09:44,530
Alright, cat, it's time to wake up.

5859

Oh, God.

5863
06:09:55,330 --> 06:09:56,550
I don't know where he's gonna go.

5864
06:09:57,110 --> 06:09:57,670
Where he's gonna go.

5865
06:09:59,910 --> 06:10:00,450
It's okay.

5866
06:10:01,010 --> 06:10:02,230
We just gotta wake her up.

5867
06:10:03,510 --> 06:10:04,730
Are you fucking kidding me?

5868
06:10:04,810 --> 06:10:05,510

5869
06:10:06,030 --> 06:10:06,830

Oh, I'm really worried because I am missing the tooth right

06:11:06,450 --> 06:11:07,550
I fucked up with that.

I do have three, but like, I'm scared because I did.

5879
06:11:15,290 --> 06:11:17,570
I am missing the strongest death defiance.

Okay, how do I get out of here?

limitless in all this?

06:13:16,760 --> 06:13:18,540
They're not doing all right.

5913
06:13:18,820 --> 06:13:22,720
I mean, they are fighting a lot of things, but I think
they're doing all right.

If you had to choose which game do you think is better?

06:19:02,140 --> 06:19:03,220
That was actually very close.

5980
06:19:03,760 --> 06:19:03,860
All right.

5981
06:19:03,960 --> 06:19:04,800
Let me stand still.

5982
06:19:08,440 --> 06:19:08,880
Okay.

5983
06:19:15,270 --> 06:19:15,970
Palm time.

5984
06:19:16,890 --> 06:19:18,210
Faster, foes with it.

5985
06:19:19,870 --> 06:19:20,370
Hmm.

5986
06:19:21,090 --> 06:19:24,250
I guess back burner.

5987
06:19:25,850 --> 06:19:26,050
Hmm.

5988
06:19:29,630 --> 06:19:30,110
Uh...

5989
06:19:30,930 --> 06:19:34,390
I guess 111% is a lot.

5990
06:19:35,650 --> 06:19:38,230
I think I do have re... Yeah, I'll take... It's a lot.

5991
06:19:38,490 --> 06:19:39,210
A few more chambers.

5992
06:19:39,230 --> 06:19:40,090
It is a lot.

5993
06:19:40,850 --> 06:19:42,150
I'm like thinking about it.

5994
06:19:43,090 --> 06:19:43,390
Okay.

5995
06:19:46,810 --> 06:19:47,290
Okay.

5996
06:19:47,870 --> 06:19:49,370
My backstabbing him, I can't tell.

5997
06:19:51,930 --> 06:19:52,430
I get that.

5998
06:19:52,490 --> 06:19:53,290
Where are their backs?

5999
06:19:53,690 --> 06:19:54,810
It's just a head.

6000
06:19:57,310 --> 06:20:01,290
Look, it's very hard to tell where the fucking facts are in
for this.

6001
06:20:01,970 --> 06:20:03,150
It's just all head.

6002
06:20:03,690 --> 06:20:04,490
Whoops, all head.

6003
06:20:09,060 --> 06:20:10,380
There you go.

6004
06:20:12,600 --> 06:20:13,120
Anything back here?

6005
06:20:13,340 --> 06:20:13,540
No.

6006
06:20:15,520 --> 06:20:16,720
Yeah, at least my boomer...

6007
06:20:16,720 --> 06:20:18,780
That's good to know that my boomerang...

6008
06:20:18,780 --> 06:20:20,180
Oh my god!

6009
06:20:20,920 --> 06:20:21,760
Oh my!

6010
06:20:21,960 --> 06:20:23,080
Okay, okay, wake up.

6011
06:20:23,280 --> 06:20:23,960
Wake up.

6012
06:20:24,020 --> 06:20:25,080
Oh, wake up.

6013
06:20:28,220 --> 06:20:29,980
Yeah, this is not good for me.

6014
06:20:30,940 --> 06:20:32,560
It is not, this is a lot.

6015
06:20:35,660 --> 06:20:36,440
Okay, that's fine.

6016
06:20:40,340 --> 06:20:43,960
I need to remember to use my, uh, my summon.

6017
06:20:44,380 --> 06:20:45,680
I forgot about my summons again.

6018
06:20:46,580 --> 06:20:47,980
I'm just gonna stay over here.

6019
06:20:49,620 --> 06:20:50,380
There you go.

6020
06:20:50,560 --> 06:20:52,060
Wait, which one's, oh my god, that's fine.

6021
06:20:54,960 --> 06:20:56,800
Which one's mine and which one's the enemy?

6022
06:20:56,960 --> 06:20:57,480
I can't tell.

6023
06:21:00,780 --> 06:21:01,240
Okay.

6024
06:21:02,140 --> 06:21:02,640
Oh, moon.

6025
06:21:02,920 --> 06:21:06,040
Okay, I can get the final for my minion for this.

6026
06:21:10,890 --> 06:21:11,570
Yeah, okay.

6027
06:21:12,510 --> 06:21:12,910
It's fine.

6028
06:21:15,930 --> 06:21:18,350
I'll also get like my final thing for my summons.

6029
06:21:24,230 --> 06:21:24,990
Okay, backstab.

6030
06:21:27,090 --> 06:21:27,550
Backstab.

6031
06:21:32,340 --> 06:21:32,720
Okay, nice.

6032
06:21:33,340 --> 06:21:34,800
Oh my god, there's so much going on.

6033
06:21:35,080 --> 06:21:35,880
Oh my god!

6034
06:21:36,760 --> 06:21:37,100
Summon!

6035
06:21:38,020 --> 06:21:38,080
Summon!

6036
06:21:39,600 --> 06:21:40,760
Where am I?

6037
06:21:40,880 --> 06:21:43,040
I actually lost track where I am.

6038
06:21:43,880 --> 06:21:44,680
I can't tell.

6039
06:21:45,580 --> 06:21:47,120
Where the fuck am I?

6040
06:21:50,100 --> 06:21:50,620
Okay.

6041
06:21:53,440 --> 06:21:54,660
I'll make it over, right?

6042
06:21:54,760 --> 06:21:54,940
Okay.

6043
06:21:55,780 --> 06:21:57,360
You'd steal 5%.

6044
06:21:58,260 --> 06:21:59,480
All right, we'll grab that.

6045
06:22:00,240 --> 06:22:01,560
And then...

6046
06:22:04,060 --> 06:22:04,580
Boom.

6047
06:22:04,820 --> 06:22:05,600
Eraser and that's...

6048
06:22:07,160 --> 06:22:08,440
That'll grab this.

6049
06:22:12,060 --> 06:22:12,660
Uh...

6050
06:22:18,280 --> 06:22:19,820
Alright, that's five.

6051
06:22:21,460 --> 06:22:22,040
Oh!

6052
06:22:24,480 --> 06:22:24,860
Oh!

6053
06:22:25,140 --> 06:22:26,460
No, I can't do it.

6054
06:22:27,080 --> 06:22:28,480
I won't make it.

6055
06:22:29,880 --> 06:22:30,920
Five encounters.

6056
06:22:31,980 --> 06:22:34,420
I should grab this.

6057
06:22:37,240 --> 06:22:40,420
Yeah, because I think the next one is...

6058
06:22:40,420 --> 06:22:41,360
Yeah, it is.

6059
06:22:42,120 --> 06:22:43,060
Next one would be chaos.

Returned from above ground.

6080
06:24:49,860 --> 06:24:51,220
You continue to return.

6081
06:24:52,140 --> 06:24:58,920
more than these conversations of ours but also that mirror
and those squalid shameless hand the whole the single

6082
06:24:58,920 --> 06:25:07,560
artifact i could not budge but it is useless without night
herself i'm not here for this house's former furnishings you

6083
06:25:07,560 --> 06:25:13,860
should know you have at least one relative who would be most
distraught if you were destroyed you alone can prevent that

6084
06:25:13,860 --> 06:25:24,860
if you would end all this only one that's so sad grandpa oh
i intend to But we are far past the point of preventing the

6085
06:25:24,860 --> 06:25:30,060
distress of this supposed relative to whom you refer What
was already done is done.

6086
06:25:30,560 --> 06:25:31,480
Yeah, I'm like, who?

6087
06:25:33,200 --> 06:25:34,360
That's so sad.

6088
06:25:34,520 --> 06:25:36,780
It's like only one person is coming to your funeral.

6089
06:25:37,000 --> 06:25:38,600
That's like one of the sad parts.

6090
06:25:42,480 --> 06:25:44,120
Okay, where is my cat though?

6091
06:25:44,680 --> 06:25:45,840
Wake up, wake up.

6092
06:25:52,010 --> 06:25:53,690
Oh my god, my armor's already gone.

6093
06:25:57,850 --> 06:25:58,630
already got.

6094
06:25:59,170 --> 06:26:00,070
That's not good.

6095
06:26:05,110 --> 06:26:05,790
Okay.

6096
06:26:10,570 --> 06:26:11,250
What?

6097
06:26:12,730 --> 06:26:13,450
That's bullshit.

6098
06:26:17,940 --> 06:26:18,480
Okay, that's fine.

6099
06:26:21,400 --> 06:26:22,400
I need to get rid of this anyway.

6100
06:26:24,660 --> 06:26:24,840
Okay.

6101
06:26:27,020 --> 06:26:28,140
Alright, it's fine.

6102
06:26:28,840 --> 06:26:29,400
Where's my cat?

6103
06:26:33,760 --> 06:26:34,660
It's okay.

6104
06:26:35,840 --> 06:26:36,740
Oh my god.

6105
06:26:38,520 --> 06:26:39,660
Oh my god, I have summons.

6106
06:26:39,840 --> 06:26:40,920
I almost forgot about my summons.

6107
06:26:44,900 --> 06:26:45,340
Okay.

6108
06:26:46,500 --> 06:26:47,540
Oh god, I didn't even see that.

6109
06:26:55,010 --> 06:26:56,690
Okay, I gotta get this guy out of here.

6110
06:26:57,310 --> 06:26:58,650
Are you fucking kidding me?

6111
06:27:00,890 --> 06:27:01,630
There you go.

6112
06:27:02,710 --> 06:27:03,190
Where is he?

6113
06:27:03,890 --> 06:27:04,830
Oh fuck, okay.

6114
06:27:05,090 --> 06:27:06,230
He missed him, he missed.

6115
06:27:06,250 --> 06:27:07,430
Ha ha, you missed, bitch.

6116
06:27:08,410 --> 06:27:09,350
I'm gonna take it.

6117
06:27:12,250 --> 06:27:29,490
three two all right at least he's sleeping yeah I can't get
there are you fucking oh my god oh my god and then of course

6118
06:27:29,490 --> 06:27:30,030

6119
06:27:33,770 --> 06:27:37,050
oh my god he's sleeping here

6120
06:27:42,160 --> 06:27:43,320
Okay, that's five.

6121
06:27:43,800 --> 06:27:45,080
It's not, but that's five.

6122
06:27:46,320 --> 06:27:47,220
Oh, it got me.

6123
06:27:48,060 --> 06:27:48,840
It got me.

6124
06:27:52,160 --> 06:27:52,640
Okay.

6125
06:27:54,540 --> 06:27:55,540
Where's the healer?

6126
06:27:57,400 --> 06:27:58,960
Okay, that's five.

6127
06:27:59,740 --> 06:28:01,100
That's an easy summon for me.

6128
06:28:04,000 --> 06:28:05,240
Oh, oh, we're okay.

6129
06:28:05,680 --> 06:28:05,860
We're okay.

6130
06:28:08,040 --> 06:28:08,920
Oh, my God.

6131
06:28:08,960 --> 06:28:09,560
That's not good.

6132
06:28:10,360 --> 06:28:10,840
Okay.

6133
06:28:14,600 --> 06:28:15,480
Oh, my god.

6134
06:28:16,480 --> 06:28:16,560
Heal!

6135
06:28:16,760 --> 06:28:17,140
Heal me!

6136
06:28:17,480 --> 06:28:17,820
Heal me!

6137
06:28:18,240 --> 06:28:18,780
Heal me!

6138
06:28:18,780 --> 06:28:22,880
Help me!

6139
06:28:22,880 --> 06:28:24,800
Help me!

6140
06:28:27,320 --> 06:28:28,380
Okay, there we go.

6141
06:28:28,740 --> 06:28:29,100
There we go.

6142
06:28:29,240 --> 06:28:29,600
Heal me.

6143
06:28:30,140 --> 06:28:30,860
It's fine.

6144
06:28:31,080 --> 06:28:31,320
Heal me.

6145
06:28:31,620 --> 06:28:32,220
Heal me.

6146
06:28:32,820 --> 06:28:34,180
There we go.

6147
06:28:35,060 --> 06:28:41,380
Oh, I had a good build in the end.

6148
06:28:41,580 --> 06:28:41,920
That's good.

6149
06:28:43,980 --> 06:28:46,160
No depth of fire is needed.

6150
06:28:46,540 --> 06:28:49,300
I've had a really good build for this one, for this weapon.

6151
06:28:49,920 --> 06:28:50,340
I'm glad.

6152
06:28:50,660 --> 06:28:51,140
Of course you do.

6153
06:28:51,580 --> 06:28:53,380
That was really strong.

6154
06:28:56,700 --> 06:29:00,620
Yeah, the backstab build was actually nuts.

6155
06:29:01,360 --> 06:29:03,900
And do hurry.

6156
06:29:04,620 --> 06:29:06,380
Fry shall never be gone.

6157
06:29:10,480 --> 06:29:10,980
Bye.

6158
06:29:12,180 --> 06:29:13,780
Bye, Grandpappy.

6159
06:29:14,780 --> 06:29:16,220
Should I try for the surface?

6160
06:29:16,900 --> 06:29:20,320
If I get backstab build again, it'll be really good for us.

6161
06:29:22,100 --> 06:29:25,040
Oh my god, I've been taking so long for these builds.

6162
06:29:26,720 --> 06:29:27,800
He's gone for now.

6163
06:29:29,520 --> 06:29:31,840
Alright, I'll try a backstab build for the surface.

6164
06:29:34,020 --> 06:29:36,360
But I have to get a backstab build, though.

6165
06:29:39,320 --> 06:29:40,740
Surface is way harder.

6166
06:29:41,080 --> 06:29:41,880
I know, that's what I'm saying.

6167
06:29:42,120 --> 06:29:43,840
Do I keep with a backstab build?

6168
06:29:44,880 --> 06:29:58,520
something beside the bed oh shit guy caros this must be it
got it dream its essence is real yeah we did it we got the

6169
06:29:58,520 --> 06:30:14,720
weapon once more night and darkness guide me to my blood
beyond the grasp of time oh you always said to trust my

6170
06:30:14,720 --> 06:30:17,840
instincts so Oh my god, he pulled through.

6171
06:30:17,980 --> 06:30:18,960
My brother pulled through.

6172
06:30:25,920 --> 06:30:28,640
No, the axe build I was tanking so much.

6173
06:30:28,720 --> 06:30:30,100
I don't think it's going to work in the long run.

6174
06:30:33,420 --> 06:30:34,280
Zachary, you did it.

6175
06:30:34,820 --> 06:30:38,820
I found the traces of Gargoyle is here, which should be what
I need for what comes next.

6176
06:30:41,840 --> 06:30:43,100
No, I was not doing it.

6177
06:30:43,100 --> 06:30:45,380
I used all my death defiances for that build.

6178
06:30:46,180 --> 06:30:47,900
I don't think it's going to go well.

6179
06:30:55,870 --> 06:31:03,430
takes but i've been giving this a lot of thought and there's
an alternative i wanted to propose you said before you've

6180
06:31:03,430 --> 06:31:12,290
never even met kronos let's say you find him in his fetid
layer what are the outcomes then well let's see one i could

6181
06:31:12,290 --> 06:31:18,930
murder him as we discussed two i could fail miserably in the
attempt or three we hit a thousand oh yeah yeah maybe maybe

6182
06:31:18,930 --> 06:31:24,730
grandpa will you know maybe you'll be best friends with
grandpappy and then he won't freeze you more or less bear

6183
06:31:24,730 --> 06:31:33,210
with me what if prior to striking you first took that latter
course got to know him endeared yourself to him if possible

6184
06:31:33,210 --> 06:31:39,410
wait what we'd have ourselves a nice grandson to grandfather
chat I could invite him to the house for a bottle of

6185
06:31:39,410 --> 06:31:49,090
Ambrosia he's been festering a while perhaps he's keen for
company you're serious I am but he's been festering for far

6186
06:31:49,090 --> 06:31:55,650
too long and very bitter that our family broke ties with him
his ambitions likely can't be changed even in your time

6187
06:31:55,650 --> 06:32:04,090
though if nothing else perhaps you can use such knowledge
against him you really do mean he and i should have a chat

6188
06:32:04,090 --> 06:32:11,750
so we become best mates what then and maybe if you become
his best friends he won't be misunderstood anymore you know

6189
06:32:11,750 --> 06:32:19,630
like all disney villains just talk to them and then
everything gets better a security specialist it ought to be

6190
06:32:19,630 --> 06:32:24,770
within your right he probably is far too proud to go quietly
but it's a chance.

6191
06:32:27,210 --> 06:32:27,810
Well, why not?

6192
06:32:28,070 --> 06:32:32,410
If he hasn't met me right, or you for that matter, then he
can't be harder to talk to than father,

6193
06:32:35,420 --> 06:32:36,460
on site version at least.

6194
06:32:39,360 --> 06:32:45,400
But I need assurances that if the conversation does not go
the way you wish, you will not hesitate to run him through.

6195
06:32:47,780 --> 06:32:49,040
Then here are those assurances.

6196
06:32:49,700 --> 06:32:53,680
If I meet him, can't get through to him, don't like him, and
determine he's a threat to you and all of us.

6197
06:32:54,540 --> 06:32:55,200
I'll kill him.

6198
06:32:55,340 --> 06:32:55,700
Whoa!

6199
06:32:56,340 --> 06:33:05,320
just that easy what if he just okay but he can come back to
life though I had this task death to Kronos but that was

6200
06:33:05,320 --> 06:33:10,920
never the goal in its entirety yeah he's like I'll just kill
him it's like is this that easy you know I'll just kill him

6201
06:33:10,920 --> 06:33:22,080
I'm like bro I killed him like seven times right it's not
that easy I'm like bro like I've killed him three times bro

6202
06:33:22,080 --> 06:33:26,520
he's still there Be ready.

6203
06:33:27,460 --> 06:33:32,600
Preparing Gaigaros may take a little while, and I may have
difficulty reaching you until such time, but I'll return.

6204
06:33:33,440 --> 06:33:35,320
Till then, be well, Zagreus.

6205
06:33:36,100 --> 06:33:36,480
Big brother.

6206
06:33:37,060 --> 06:33:38,860
He's got a real big spear, though.

6207
06:33:38,940 --> 06:33:39,580
He does.

6208
06:33:39,780 --> 06:33:42,320
I don't know, but it's not that easy to kill him.

6209
06:33:43,360 --> 06:33:44,640
It doesn't matter.

6210
06:33:46,000 --> 06:33:47,160
What is easy for me?

6211
06:33:47,240 --> 06:33:48,480
I'm a gamer, but we don't know.

6212
06:33:51,360 --> 06:33:54,980
Look, Zagreus, he has been doing these runs in a while,
guys.

6213
06:33:55,820 --> 06:33:56,220
Washed.

6214
06:33:56,540 --> 06:33:57,800
For the dissolution of time.

6215
06:33:58,480 --> 06:33:59,780
But I won't find it in the underworld.

6216
06:34:02,520 --> 06:34:04,220
Guys, he's fucking washed right now.

6217
06:34:04,320 --> 06:34:07,020
He's been chilling with his multiple girlfriends.

6218
06:34:08,500 --> 06:34:10,200
I've heard about the latest happening, sister.

6219
06:34:10,460 --> 06:34:12,320
But we'll discuss them out there on the hunt.

6220
06:34:12,980 --> 06:34:14,360
Not while we're here.

6221
06:34:15,920 --> 06:34:18,100
Oh, she just wants to sing.

6222
06:34:18,940 --> 06:34:20,580
Alright, we have...

6223
06:34:21,280 --> 06:34:22,240
What's to be done?

6224
06:34:22,480 --> 06:34:23,260
Okay, that's good.

6225
06:34:23,300 --> 06:34:24,740
We need more fountain water anyway.

6226
06:34:25,960 --> 06:34:27,380
And boyfriends, sorry, too.

6227
06:34:27,520 --> 06:34:29,700
His multiple girlfriends and boyfriends.

6228
06:34:32,260 --> 06:34:35,980
Yeah, I don't know if he's fit right now to do all that
shit.

6229
06:34:37,060 --> 06:34:37,500
I still don't.

6230
06:34:37,620 --> 06:34:38,700
I must be the last one.

6231
06:34:38,740 --> 06:34:39,920
Must be, like, on the surface.

6232
06:34:41,980 --> 06:34:43,700
Let's grab these plants.

6233
06:34:44,780 --> 06:34:47,020
I guess now I can just plant mystery seeds.

6234
06:34:47,040 --> 06:34:48,500
Oh, I don't have any mystery seeds.

6235
06:34:48,580 --> 06:34:49,740
I'll just plant random shit.

6236
06:34:50,360 --> 06:34:52,320
Because I don't need it, technically.

6237
06:34:54,680 --> 06:34:54,820
Oh.

6238
06:34:55,840 --> 06:34:57,700
I'll just grab everything here.

6239
06:35:00,240 --> 06:35:01,680
Your goal is within reach, Goddess.

6240
06:35:01,980 --> 06:35:05,100
That much I know, just from how tense the good witch seems
to be of late.

6241
06:35:05,940 --> 06:35:09,620
Not to pry, but are you clear about what more needs to be
done?

6242
06:35:11,460 --> 06:35:12,120
I believe so.

6243
06:35:12,560 --> 06:35:16,320
I'd be inclined to tell you all of it, except you know how
Headmistress gets about these things.

6244
06:35:16,960 --> 06:35:19,700
Suffice it to say that the final phase of our plan is in
progress.

6245
06:35:19,780 --> 06:35:20,120
Yay!

6246
06:35:20,600 --> 06:35:21,420
I'm doing it.

6247
06:35:21,520 --> 06:35:22,260
That's all I need to hear.

6248
06:35:22,720 --> 06:35:23,980
This phase is up to you and her.

6249
06:35:25,820 --> 06:35:36,340
the surface level just this is that easy just just you know

6250
06:35:36,340 --> 06:35:45,380

charge to think the fates themselves may have denied me the

6251

Oh my gosh, I still don't have enough.

6257
06:36:42,280 --> 06:36:43,480
Oh, I need shadow.

6258
06:36:44,000 --> 06:36:45,120
Fuck, okay, I need...

6259
06:36:45,120 --> 06:36:45,200
Yeah.

6260
06:36:46,260 --> 06:36:47,340
Can't do anything here.

6261
06:36:47,600 --> 06:36:48,080
I'm poor.

6262
06:36:49,440 --> 06:36:51,060
What say the cards this Eve?

6263
06:36:52,400 --> 06:36:53,440
Oh, nice.

6264
06:36:53,680 --> 06:36:53,940
Okay.

6265
06:36:56,260 --> 06:36:57,180
Oh, nice.

6266
06:36:57,840 --> 06:36:58,200
Yay!

6267
06:37:02,540 --> 06:37:03,060
Yay!

6268
06:37:03,060 --> 06:37:04,700
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

6269
06:37:06,140 --> 06:37:09,740
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

6270
06:37:10,060 --> 06:37:11,640
Alright, I can't upgrade now.

6271
06:37:12,520 --> 06:37:15,540
Uh, I wanted to grab this.

6272
06:37:17,900 --> 06:37:18,820
I want to try this.

6273
06:37:19,100 --> 06:37:20,260
Show me your true strength.

6274
06:37:21,880 --> 06:37:23,200
Alright, let's try it.

6275
06:37:25,060 --> 06:37:26,280
Let's try this.

6276
06:37:27,740 --> 06:37:28,720
What does this look like?

6277
06:37:29,200 --> 06:37:30,520
What the fuck is that?

6278
06:37:31,400 --> 06:37:32,020
Oh!

6279
06:37:34,280 --> 06:37:34,900
Oh!

6280
06:37:35,200 --> 06:37:36,680
Wait, I like that.

6281
06:37:36,900 --> 06:37:37,520
Let's try that out.

6282
06:37:37,880 --> 06:37:43,080
The ancient fate-wrought arms of night is now rejoined under
the princess of the underworld's care.

6283
06:37:43,660 --> 06:37:46,780
All equally prepared to rid the realm of any of its foes.

6284
06:37:49,220 --> 06:37:49,760
Origination.

6285
06:37:50,160 --> 06:37:52,460
What the fuck is that?

6286
06:37:54,060 --> 06:37:56,520
Guys, I don't know you even know what that is.

6287
06:37:57,640 --> 06:37:58,180
Origination?

6288
06:38:00,420 --> 06:38:01,580
Where is that?

6289
06:38:02,900 --> 06:38:03,640
Or cana?

6290
06:38:07,340 --> 06:38:07,860
Oh!

6291
06:38:08,380 --> 06:38:08,860
Not now.

6292
06:38:12,810 --> 06:38:13,250
Curses.

6293
06:38:16,470 --> 06:38:18,190
Wait, but I don't have enough.

6294
06:38:18,350 --> 06:38:19,570
Who do I get rid of, though?

6295
06:38:21,070 --> 06:38:22,830
Okay, but what do I get rid of?

6296
06:38:23,310 --> 06:38:23,810
Oh, money?

6297
06:38:24,110 --> 06:38:24,750
I guess I...

6298
06:38:24,750 --> 06:38:24,990
Oh.

6299
06:38:27,370 --> 06:38:27,890
Oh.

6300
06:38:31,130 --> 06:38:31,650
Oh.

6301
06:38:35,850 --> 06:38:38,550
Um, maybe do I have enough?

6302
06:38:39,490 --> 06:38:39,970
Ash.

6303
06:38:40,690 --> 06:38:42,730
Ooh, that's awkward.

6304
06:38:43,750 --> 06:38:44,490
Oh, I can sell?

6305
06:38:44,810 --> 06:38:46,090
How do I sell my fish?

6306
06:38:48,310 --> 06:38:49,730
We'll take my fish.

6307
06:38:53,050 --> 06:38:53,950
We'll take it.

6308
06:38:54,370 --> 06:38:55,590
I have fish for sale.

6309
06:38:57,410 --> 06:38:58,990
Oh, I can't sell it yet.

6310
06:38:59,090 --> 06:38:59,410
Oh.

6311
06:39:00,150 --> 06:39:01,010
Oh, okay.

6312
06:39:01,150 --> 06:39:02,010
Oh, that's awkward.

6313
06:39:02,550 --> 06:39:02,690
Oh.

6314
06:39:05,270 --> 06:39:06,570
Alright, I guess not.

6315
06:39:06,970 --> 06:39:08,590
I guess we just go up to the surface.

6316
06:39:08,610 --> 06:39:17,630
then oh my god we'll get rid of this oh what the fuck oh
shit yeah no get that shit out of here best be a little

6321
06:39:43,730 --> 06:39:45,570
You'll get to spruce up your nocturnal arms.

6322
06:39:45,790 --> 06:39:46,690
We'll get to see what happens.

6323
06:39:46,690 --> 06:39:47,510
No, that's okay, guys.

6324
06:39:47,550 --> 06:39:48,150
It's okay, guys.

6325
06:39:48,150 --> 06:39:49,770
We don't need to upgrade anything, guys.

6326
06:39:49,970 --> 06:39:50,730
It's okay, guys.

6327
06:39:50,910 --> 06:39:51,430
We just...

6328
06:39:51,430 --> 06:39:52,970
It's just time to do the runs.

6329
06:39:53,850 --> 06:39:54,510
It's okay.

6330
06:39:54,510 --> 06:39:56,910
We're just gonna do the runs now, guys.

6331
06:39:58,590 --> 06:39:59,070
I have it.

6332
06:39:59,070 --> 06:39:59,630
No use.

6333
06:40:02,670 --> 06:40:03,070
Uh...

6334
06:40:05,150 --> 06:40:07,110
Okay, so I...

6335
06:40:08,710 --> 06:40:09,910
Yeah, I don't have anything.

6336
06:40:10,130 --> 06:40:11,370
Oh, I could upgrade an insight.

6337
06:40:12,650 --> 06:40:13,350
Can I upgrade?

6338
06:40:17,970 --> 06:40:18,430
Uh...

6339
06:40:18,430 --> 06:40:19,250
Plus three.

6340
06:40:20,270 --> 06:40:20,630
Oh!

6341
06:40:27,210 --> 06:40:29,130
Do I save for depth defiance?

6342
06:40:29,310 --> 06:40:29,830
I could.

6343
06:40:30,310 --> 06:40:31,410
I don't think so.

6344
06:40:32,830 --> 06:40:33,910
I feel sure it's a good one.

6345
06:40:34,070 --> 06:40:34,870
Should I just do that?

6346
06:40:36,670 --> 06:40:37,050
Chat.

6347
06:40:39,530 --> 06:40:40,310
For re-rows?

6348
06:40:41,350 --> 06:40:42,950
I don't think I need the re-rows.

6349
06:40:44,990 --> 06:40:46,450
Or initial HP.

6350
06:40:46,810 --> 06:40:47,470
Oh, wait.

6351
06:40:47,690 --> 06:40:48,430
Restore is four.

6352
06:40:48,630 --> 06:40:49,730
I could do that, too.

6353
06:40:51,050 --> 06:40:52,030
Is this worth it?

6354
06:40:52,270 --> 06:40:53,250
I'm in four Restore.

6355
06:40:53,430 --> 06:40:53,910
Oh, wait.

6356
06:40:55,670 --> 06:40:56,350
Plus 30.

6357
06:40:56,830 --> 06:40:57,110
Yeah.

6358
06:40:57,630 --> 06:40:58,290
Max life.

6359
06:40:58,890 --> 06:40:59,590
I'm going to get that.

6360
06:41:00,710 --> 06:41:01,450
More HP.

6361
06:41:02,630 --> 06:41:03,970
All right, let's try a surface run.

6362
06:41:04,930 --> 06:41:05,250
All right.

6363
06:41:05,630 --> 06:41:06,810
Let's try this out.

6364
06:41:08,130 --> 06:41:08,690
Let's see what we can get.

6365
06:41:08,870 --> 06:41:10,590
Let's see what we can kill Prometheus this time.

6366
06:41:12,010 --> 06:41:13,050
A hammer?

6367
06:41:15,690 --> 06:41:17,050
Oh, shit.

6368
06:41:25,810 --> 06:41:26,770
Oh, shit.

6369
06:41:29,510 --> 06:41:30,490
It's hard.

6370
06:41:37,660 --> 06:41:39,900
That requires me to channel this more.

6371
06:41:40,600 --> 06:41:42,460
But, do I do it?

6372
06:41:43,980 --> 06:41:45,220
One with the staff?

6373
06:41:46,160 --> 06:41:46,880
I will try.

6374
06:41:47,280 --> 06:41:47,940
My stuff.

6375
06:41:53,930 --> 06:41:55,330
Yeah, and I have the moments, too.

6376
06:41:55,350 --> 06:41:55,970

6383
06:43:14,410 --> 06:43:16,050
Very good versus bosses.

6384
06:43:18,510 --> 06:43:20,630
It's bad for this weapon.

6385
06:43:23,590 --> 06:43:23,990
I'm going

6386
06:43:30,160 --> 06:43:32,840
to say one.

6387
06:43:40,880 --> 06:43:41,740
Other three.

6388
06:43:42,440 --> 06:43:43,880
Majority rules.

6389
06:43:49,100 --> 06:43:49,920
Sorry, buddy.

6390
06:43:50,220 --> 06:43:51,280
Majority rules.

6391
06:43:52,040 --> 06:43:53,940
Alright, let's calculate this.

6392
06:43:54,780 --> 06:43:55,480
Oh, hey, what?

6393
06:43:55,600 --> 06:43:56,580
There's someone to talk to.

6394
06:43:58,080 --> 06:44:00,860
We'll grab Zeus first, just for the...

6395
06:44:00,860 --> 06:44:02,060
Actually, no, let's talk.

6396
06:44:02,180 --> 06:44:03,640
Let's go get the talking one.

6397
06:44:03,840 --> 06:44:04,800
Let's go see the NPC.

6398
06:44:06,580 --> 06:44:07,280
Is it Hercules?

6399
06:44:09,100 --> 06:44:10,560
Oh, who are you?

6400
06:44:12,000 --> 06:44:12,420
Hello?

6401
06:44:12,560 --> 06:44:13,180
Oh, wait, mine.

6402
06:44:13,600 --> 06:44:15,660
Mining, mining, mining.

6403
06:44:17,420 --> 06:44:17,780
Mining.

6404
06:44:19,120 --> 06:44:19,560
Media.

6405
06:44:20,500 --> 06:44:20,800
Media?

6406
06:44:21,960 --> 06:44:32,140

6419
06:46:01,980 --> 06:46:02,620
I'm going for three.

6420
06:46:03,980 --> 06:46:05,280
I feel like I need HP more.

6421
06:46:05,640 --> 06:46:06,180

6422
06:46:09,770 --> 06:46:12,570

Zeus is here.

6427
06:46:33,920 --> 06:46:34,900
What the fuck?

6428
06:46:37,980 --> 06:46:38,780
There you go.

6429
06:46:40,000 --> 06:46:41,160
Yeah, I got the Pylon.

6430
06:46:47,180 --> 06:46:49,100
We got the cat over here, too.

6431
06:46:50,560 --> 06:46:52,200
Oh, fuck, I didn't even see the house.

6432
06:46:53,380 --> 06:46:53,920
I didn't see that.

6433
06:46:54,000 --> 06:46:56,480
I didn't see this guy's fucking house right here.

6434
06:46:57,040 --> 06:46:57,880
No house for you.

6435
06:47:01,460 --> 06:47:01,920
Nice.

6436
06:47:02,160 --> 06:47:03,200
And there's food, too.

6437
06:47:05,220 --> 06:47:06,980
Oh, I forgot to gift her.

6438
06:47:07,100 --> 06:47:08,600
I forgot to gift the mom.

6439
06:47:08,900 --> 06:47:13,100
There is some difference of opinion here regarding where
your efforts are of greatest benefit.

6440
06:47:13,760 --> 06:47:15,940
We shall keep the matter on Olympus well in hand.

6441
06:47:16,260 --> 06:47:19,780
But we cannot get to Kronos in your father's realm as easily
as you.

6442
06:47:19,800 --> 06:47:21,060
Hermes is a must.

6443
06:47:21,380 --> 06:47:24,380
Okay, well, do not blitz on attack.

6444
06:47:24,480 --> 06:47:25,140
Wait, why not?

6445
06:47:29,630 --> 06:47:30,890
Alright, one or three?

6446
06:47:37,700 --> 06:47:38,100
Three?

6447
06:47:39,340 --> 06:47:40,460
Three days solid?

6448
06:47:41,380 --> 06:47:44,600
Oh my god, that's not a lot of magic now.

6449
06:47:47,140 --> 06:47:51,280
Oh no, I don't know why I decided to freeze the fucking...

6450
06:47:52,760 --> 06:47:54,240
Let me freeze the house real quick.

6451
06:47:54,500 --> 06:47:55,640
Gotta make sure he doesn't move.

6452
06:47:57,540 --> 06:47:59,740
Guys, I gotta make sure.

6453
06:48:01,720 --> 06:48:02,180
Alright.

6454
06:48:04,020 --> 06:48:05,340
Yeah, it's 30.

6455
06:48:06,160 --> 06:48:07,020
You're back.

6456
06:48:08,580 --> 06:48:10,140
I gotta get more mana.

6457
06:48:10,780 --> 06:48:12,700
Gotta freeze the house, guys.

6458
06:48:12,960 --> 06:48:14,740
We don't know if the house is gonna move.

6459
06:48:14,960 --> 06:48:15,320
We don't.

6460
06:48:16,100 --> 06:48:19,700
We gotta make sure to keep the house there.

6461
06:48:20,820 --> 06:48:22,880
What if the house grows legs?

6462
06:48:24,520 --> 06:48:26,060
It could happen.

6463
06:48:29,580 --> 06:48:31,540
Okay, we should get the magic.

6464
06:48:31,980 --> 06:48:33,480
Yeah, magic and the moon.

6465
06:48:35,060 --> 06:48:36,440
I'm gonna get magic and moon.

6466
06:48:38,440 --> 06:48:39,380
We need magic.

6467
06:48:40,840 --> 06:48:41,780
Really badly.

6468
06:48:46,940 --> 06:48:47,400
Alright.

6469
06:48:49,200 --> 06:48:50,260
Wait, the hunter is...

6470
06:48:50,260 --> 06:48:50,660
Oh, wait!

6471
06:48:51,500 --> 06:48:52,260
Athena's here.

6472
06:48:54,120 --> 06:48:54,560
Nice.

6473
06:48:55,460 --> 06:48:56,460
That's nice of her.

6474
06:49:04,490 --> 06:49:04,730
Oh.

6475
06:49:06,610 --> 06:49:07,430
It's alright.

6476
06:49:08,330 --> 06:49:09,570
I got it again.

6477
06:49:11,370 --> 06:49:12,950
Uh, oh hey.

6478
06:49:13,910 --> 06:49:14,610
Don't be frightened.

6479
06:49:15,890 --> 06:49:16,550
Hail sister.

6480
06:49:20,670 --> 06:49:22,910
I forgot the frog does it automatically.

6481
06:49:24,390 --> 06:49:27,010
That frog doing it automatically was so good.

6482
06:49:27,430 --> 06:49:28,190
You sister.

6483
06:49:29,070 --> 06:49:30,570
Your brother once had us all convinced.

6484
06:49:30,910 --> 06:49:31,370
Sorry, Artemis.

6485
06:49:31,670 --> 06:49:32,510
His way to Olympus.

6486
06:49:33,250 --> 06:49:34,470
Now none of us can believe you're trying to do this.

6487
06:49:34,490 --> 06:49:44,330
to do it for real homies wouldn't have asked me to go if it
wasn't important nice I got magic and a and a spoon then by

6488
06:49:44,330 --> 06:49:50,590
all means what a time that you're on your way up to the
mountain while I'm on my way down to the underworld at least

6489
06:49:50,590 --> 06:50:01,230
we oh yeah I was like wondering why she was here I thought
she doesn't exist up here our seeking arrow plus 3% is not

6490
06:50:01,230 --> 06:50:07,330
that much A random flow location becomes marked if it takes
credo damage.

6491
06:50:07,790 --> 06:50:08,570
This repeats.

6492
06:50:11,150 --> 06:50:11,450
Hmm.

6493
06:50:12,530 --> 06:50:12,930
One?

6494
06:50:14,010 --> 06:50:14,650
Okay.

6495
06:50:15,110 --> 06:50:15,870
I'll try it.

6496
06:50:15,950 --> 06:50:16,310
Oh, hey.

6497
06:50:17,130 --> 06:50:17,870
Free room.

6498
06:50:21,210 --> 06:50:23,350
Oh my god, it just fucking slaps me for free.

6499
06:50:28,190 --> 06:50:29,470
All right.

6500
06:50:30,250 --> 06:50:30,890
Nice.

6501
06:50:31,270 --> 06:50:31,670
Money.

6502
06:50:32,750 --> 06:50:33,630
Oh, and food.

6503
06:50:33,890 --> 06:50:34,230
Yay.

6504
06:50:34,670 --> 06:50:35,530
Free food.

6505
06:50:41,210 --> 06:50:42,810
Oh, is there anything else here?

6506
06:50:45,610 --> 06:50:47,310
I'm glad that it gives me food.

6507
06:50:48,450 --> 06:50:50,710
Um, three more.

6508
06:50:51,110 --> 06:50:52,510
I guess I'll go for moon?

6509
06:50:53,270 --> 06:50:55,050
And I don't know which one to get after.

6510
06:50:58,760 --> 06:51:01,100
I don't know what would be good after the moon.

6511
06:51:02,420 --> 06:51:02,900
Honestly.

6512
06:51:06,160 --> 06:51:07,360
Jesus Christ, that's a lot.

6513
06:51:08,620 --> 06:51:09,000
Okay, don't worry.

6514
06:51:09,060 --> 06:51:09,900
I can summon another one.

6515
06:51:11,680 --> 06:51:13,020
I freeze the house.

6516
06:51:13,320 --> 06:51:14,180
Yeah, it's very important.

6517
06:51:15,860 --> 06:51:17,320
Okay, get over here.

6518
06:51:20,900 --> 06:51:22,480
Alright, yeah, fuck that one.

6519
06:51:23,820 --> 06:51:25,760
That's like a fucking bulldozer.

6520
06:51:26,160 --> 06:51:26,820
Holy shit.

6521
06:51:27,240 --> 06:51:28,600
I draw you down, Arun.

6522
06:51:29,000 --> 06:51:30,080
Lend me your light.

6523
06:51:30,940 --> 06:51:31,460
Hermes?

6524
06:51:31,620 --> 06:51:32,440
Okay, we'll do Hermes.

6525
06:51:32,740 --> 06:51:36,280
Of your vision in which Kronos found and captured the three
fates.

6526
06:51:37,100 --> 06:51:39,060
This must have been a key component of his plan.

6527
06:51:39,060 --> 06:51:39,800
That one has.

6528
06:51:39,940 --> 06:51:41,160
But it does not change.

6529
06:51:41,180 --> 06:51:41,660
hours.

6530
06:51:42,640 --> 06:51:45,120
The silver sisters never seed control.

6531
06:51:47,420 --> 06:51:47,780
Okay.

6532
06:51:51,820 --> 06:51:52,440
Alright.

6533
06:51:55,000 --> 06:51:56,220
Yeah, this is always good.

6534
06:51:57,600 --> 06:51:58,760
Is there any rooms?

6535
06:52:00,320 --> 06:52:02,780
I just gotta make sure I can upgrade this later too.

6536
06:52:03,740 --> 06:52:05,240
So my summons would be better.

6537
06:52:05,820 --> 06:52:06,480
Oh hey guys.

6538
06:52:07,820 --> 06:52:09,540
Can I kill these guys for free?

6539
06:52:14,640 --> 06:52:15,080
Nice.

6540
06:52:17,340 --> 06:52:17,760
Yay, money.

6541
06:52:18,620 --> 06:52:19,480
I know I didn't...

6542
06:52:19,480 --> 06:52:22,220
I didn't wait for you guys to answer me.

6543
06:52:22,540 --> 06:52:23,640
I was like, I'm going to do it.

6544
06:52:26,260 --> 06:52:26,700
Hermes.

6545
06:52:27,620 --> 06:52:28,100
There you go.

6546
06:52:28,340 --> 06:52:29,040
There's Hermes.

6547
06:52:36,210 --> 06:52:37,350
Okay, we'll grab this.

6548
06:52:37,570 --> 06:52:39,270
And then I'm going to wake up my cat real quick.

6549
06:52:40,230 --> 06:52:40,510
There you go.

6550
06:52:40,730 --> 06:52:41,350
Wake up!

6551
06:52:46,460 --> 06:52:47,680
God, I just tore the house.

6552
06:52:52,400 --> 06:52:52,980
Okay, nice.

6553
06:52:53,980 --> 06:52:56,340
I don't know who I summoned, but that's good.

6554
06:52:59,500 --> 06:53:00,640
Where's my cat again?

6555
06:53:01,000 --> 06:53:02,060
Where the fuck is my cat?

6556
06:53:02,080 --> 06:53:03,080
I'm just going to destroy this.

6557
06:53:04,680 --> 06:53:05,760
One pine on left.

6558
06:53:06,360 --> 06:53:07,380
Alright, one more pylon.

6559
06:53:10,240 --> 06:53:11,580
I always lose my cat.

6560
06:53:11,720 --> 06:53:12,740
She, like, blends in.

6561
06:53:12,860 --> 06:53:16,900
You should be resting easy in your father's care, but Graham
shut it all down, flung up in the underworld's gates, and

6562
06:53:16,900 --> 06:53:17,380
here we are.

6563
06:53:17,740 --> 06:53:19,000
If I were dead, I'd be mad, too.

6564
06:53:21,160 --> 06:53:21,520
Alright.

6565
06:53:23,220 --> 06:53:25,100
Hit block per counter.

6566
06:53:26,000 --> 06:53:26,760
Oh, three.

6567
06:53:27,660 --> 06:53:29,180
Moves are faster.

6568
06:53:34,290 --> 06:53:36,560
Is I two or three?

6569
06:53:36,940 --> 06:53:39,160
I get three hits blocked.

6570
06:53:40,060 --> 06:53:41,020
I'm full of Mega.

6571
06:53:41,320 --> 06:53:42,220
That's true.

6572
06:53:44,540 --> 06:53:45,240
Yeah.

6573
06:53:45,640 --> 06:53:46,100
I'll do it.

6574
06:53:46,220 --> 06:53:47,540
Yeah, this is a charge build.

6575
06:53:47,820 --> 06:53:48,320
I agree.

6576
06:53:50,200 --> 06:53:51,800
Yeah, but I saw like three hits.

6577
06:53:51,980 --> 06:53:52,680
Okay.

6578
06:53:53,180 --> 06:53:54,780
That's like three hits for free?

6579
06:53:56,620 --> 06:53:57,600
Alright, last one.

6580
06:53:58,460 --> 06:53:59,960
What is a good last pile on chat?

6581
06:54:01,660 --> 06:54:04,540
I am a little worried with how little HP I have, though.

6582
06:54:12,380 --> 06:54:13,640
Okay, not gonna lie.

6583
06:54:13,840 --> 06:54:15,420
This good guy has been...

6584
06:54:15,420 --> 06:54:17,640
I feel like he's, like, talking to his inner demons.

6585
06:54:18,040 --> 06:54:18,500
Like...

6586
06:54:22,120 --> 06:54:24,480
He's, like, having his own conversations.

6587
06:54:24,940 --> 06:54:25,360
With...

6588
06:54:25,360 --> 06:54:26,560
I don't know with who, though.

6589
06:54:26,940 --> 06:54:27,400
I...

6590
06:54:30,560 --> 06:54:32,560
I don't know him, who?

6591
06:54:33,340 --> 06:54:37,140
Every time I look over, I'm like, I don't know what he's
responding to.

6592
06:54:37,420 --> 06:54:41,680
I hope actually with his inner demons.

6593
06:54:48,850 --> 06:54:49,890
I'm like...

6594
06:54:51,350 --> 06:54:53,190
All right, let's see you.

6595
06:54:55,530 --> 06:54:56,690
Oh, wait, there's the house.

6596
06:55:02,530 --> 06:55:03,310
All right, nice.

6597
06:55:03,910 --> 06:55:05,070
Okay, we always need HP.

6598
06:55:05,090 --> 06:55:05,650
Oh, nice.

6599
06:55:05,770 --> 06:55:06,230
Another one.

6600
06:55:08,130 --> 06:55:08,890
Yeah, it's like...

6601
06:55:08,890 --> 06:55:09,850
Oh, wait, yeah, it is.

6602
06:55:10,110 --> 06:55:12,510
It's like the guy that's replying to his own...

6603
06:55:12,510 --> 06:55:15,510
Like, those people that do, like, replies to their own
threats.

6604
06:55:15,610 --> 06:55:15,970
Oh, wait.

6605
06:55:16,010 --> 06:55:16,690
Triple health.

6606
06:55:16,750 --> 06:55:17,250
Let's go.

6607
06:55:17,870 --> 06:55:20,190
Yeah, this one feels like every time I look over.

6608
06:55:26,460 --> 06:55:27,300
I'm like...

6609
06:55:27,300 --> 06:55:29,700
He's, like, talking to the voices right now.

6610
06:55:30,120 --> 06:55:31,940
But it's, like, the text in his head.

6611
06:55:34,680 --> 06:55:35,100
Alright.

6612
06:55:35,360 --> 06:55:36,040
Chop time.

6613
06:55:36,200 --> 06:55:37,080
I have 615.

6614
06:55:37,340 --> 06:55:38,060
That should be enough.

6615
06:55:38,280 --> 06:55:39,160
Might as well take a sip.

6616
06:55:39,280 --> 06:55:40,240
Oh, I forgot the fountain.

6617
06:55:40,360 --> 06:55:41,620
I mean, I'm full HP.

6618
06:55:43,840 --> 06:55:45,200
Oh, my God.

6619
06:55:45,240 --> 06:55:45,740
That's a lot.

6620
06:55:46,660 --> 06:55:47,700
A lot of free stuff.

6621
06:55:48,800 --> 06:55:50,020
And a fish, too?

6622
06:55:50,280 --> 06:55:51,060
Let's go.

6623
06:55:52,680 --> 06:55:53,320
It's over.

6624
06:55:54,660 --> 06:55:55,400
Got me a zeal.

6625
06:55:56,440 --> 06:55:57,940
Alright, I have enough for everything.

6626
06:56:00,340 --> 06:56:01,260
Oh, I didn't get a free hat.

6627
06:56:01,380 --> 06:56:01,800
Not free.

6628
06:56:01,880 --> 06:56:02,800
I had to pay for that.

6629
06:56:03,100 --> 06:56:03,880
There you are.

6630
06:56:04,180 --> 06:56:07,220
Paying for goods and services as though Kronos has already
prevailed.

6631
06:56:09,100 --> 06:56:11,640
all right she wants a sacrifice

6632
06:56:16,120 --> 06:56:23,920
oh plus three percent per boon plus three percent per boom

6633
06:56:28,470 --> 06:56:30,810

6634
06:56:35,740 --> 06:56:42,520

6635
06:56:46,990 --> 06:56:47,770

6636
06:56:53,950 --> 06:56:55,370
Get the atom ball.

6637
06:56:59,730 --> 06:57:01,530
All right, nice talk.

6638
06:57:05,590 --> 06:57:07,010
This is going to be a 10 plus hour stream.

6639
06:57:07,090 --> 06:57:07,930
No, no, no, no.

6640
06:57:08,050 --> 06:57:09,750
It's not going to be a 10 plus hour stream this time.

6641
06:57:10,050 --> 06:57:11,850
I just want to try Prometheus.

6642
06:57:13,050 --> 06:57:13,550
I don't know.

6643
06:57:13,670 --> 06:57:14,710
We'll see how it goes.

6644
06:57:14,870 --> 06:57:16,330
We'll see how this run goes.

6645
06:57:16,450 --> 06:57:18,570
And then I'll see if I'll do another run.

6646
06:57:18,650 --> 06:57:21,810
I just want to see if I could beat Prometheus here.

6647
06:57:22,930 --> 06:57:25,250
Because I know there's another area after Prometheus.

6648
06:57:25,550 --> 06:57:26,990
I wanted to say thanks.

6649
06:57:27,690 --> 06:57:30,490
Gave me a real zinger there last time, you know that.

6650
06:57:32,950 --> 06:57:33,690
You're back.

6651
06:57:34,190 --> 06:57:36,370
And you're grateful that I vanquished you earlier.

6652
06:57:37,170 --> 06:57:38,750
You seem more the sort to hold a grudge.

6653
06:57:40,030 --> 06:57:40,930
I'm like a challenge.

6654
06:57:41,830 --> 06:57:43,390

Why are you complaining?

6701
07:01:57,620 --> 07:01:58,220
Whoops.

6702
07:01:59,000 --> 07:01:59,600
Ash.

07:02:00,460 --> 07:02:01,900
Okay, that guy's gonna die soon.

6704
07:02:04,120 --> 07:02:06,800
Wait, I can mine some cannonballs, though.

6705
07:02:08,200 --> 07:02:09,540
Before it happens.

6706
07:02:14,220 --> 07:02:14,920
And this.

6707
07:02:17,780 --> 07:02:18,060
Alright.

6708
07:02:21,140 --> 07:02:21,720
Bomb.

6709
07:02:22,160 --> 07:02:22,560
Push closer.

6710
07:02:25,800 --> 07:02:26,820
Alright, wake up.

6711
07:02:29,920 --> 07:02:30,680
Okay, there you go.

6712
07:02:33,820 --> 07:02:34,580
Nice, wake up!

6713
07:02:36,060 --> 07:02:36,300
Alright.

6714
07:02:37,300 --> 07:02:39,460
I think the attack should be different colored.

6715
07:02:40,600 --> 07:02:42,200
I'm not gonna laugh.

6716
07:02:44,560 --> 07:02:46,020
Okay, born again.

6717
07:02:46,840 --> 07:02:47,740
Static shock.

6718
07:02:47,940 --> 07:02:48,200
Ooh.

6719
07:02:49,600 --> 07:02:50,720
Magic primed.

6720
07:02:51,100 --> 07:02:51,320
Wait.

6721
07:02:56,840 --> 07:02:57,400
One?

6722
07:03:04,260 --> 07:03:05,160
Which one?

6723
07:03:06,520 --> 07:03:07,560
One or two?

6724
07:03:08,300 --> 07:03:08,560
One?

6725
07:03:08,720 --> 07:03:10,080
Okay, I see more ones.

6726
07:03:11,620 --> 07:03:13,500
I don't know how to fight the octopus again.

6727
07:03:13,640 --> 07:03:17,360
The octopus was so fucking annoying for...

6728
07:03:17,360 --> 07:03:18,100
God damn it.

6729
07:03:20,160 --> 07:03:21,240
Are you serious?

6730
07:03:21,660 --> 07:03:23,300
Oh my god, are you fucking kidding me?

6731
07:03:23,720 --> 07:03:24,720
Alright, I have to blow shit.

6732
07:03:25,040 --> 07:03:25,720
Get over here.

6733
07:03:26,540 --> 07:03:27,540
I'm summoning him too.

6734
07:03:28,300 --> 07:03:29,740
We definitely need a moon though.

6735
07:03:31,060 --> 07:03:32,320
We need to upgrade our summons.

6736
07:03:33,240 --> 07:03:35,820
I'm not a fan of the lack of summons.

6737
07:03:38,000 --> 07:03:38,880
Keep the meter.

6738
07:03:47,700 --> 07:03:48,500
Okay, that's fine.

6739
07:03:49,700 --> 07:03:50,960
Into the sea with you.

6740
07:03:52,820 --> 07:03:54,840
Thank god, I need more.

6741
07:03:55,500 --> 07:03:55,980
What?

6742
07:03:57,740 --> 07:03:58,180
Icarus?

6743
07:03:59,460 --> 07:04:00,300
What are you doing here?

6744
07:04:00,520 --> 07:04:01,240
Wait, what?

6745
07:04:02,420 --> 07:04:03,700
Why are you dead?

6746
07:04:05,040 --> 07:04:06,380
Is that what Icarus is?

6747
07:04:06,560 --> 07:04:08,000
He flew too close to the sun.

6748
07:04:08,840 --> 07:04:09,600
Bro, stop!

6749
07:04:09,860 --> 07:04:10,900
You're gonna die!

6750
07:04:11,820 --> 07:04:14,400
You're gonna fly too close to the sun, bro!

6751
07:04:19,610 --> 07:04:20,810
Oh my god.

6752
07:04:25,240 --> 07:04:26,100
Where is he?

6753
07:04:26,180 --> 07:04:26,940
Oh, here he is.

6754
07:04:27,220 --> 07:04:28,200
He is dead.

6755
07:04:28,260 --> 07:04:28,900
Is he dead?

6756
07:04:29,600 --> 07:04:30,860
Yeah, no, but he's on the surface.

6757
07:04:30,880 --> 07:04:31,620
The surface world.

6758
07:04:31,960 --> 07:04:33,760
I spotted this ship and I had to drop in for a closer look.

6759
07:04:33,900 --> 07:04:35,120
He just got better.

6760
07:04:36,180 --> 07:04:38,160
But how is he in the surface if he's dead?

6761
07:04:40,560 --> 07:04:42,760
Yeah, you're not even supposed to be here.

6762
07:04:44,360 --> 07:04:45,720
He just got better.

6763
07:04:48,460 --> 07:04:50,060
Yeah, he just got better.

6764
07:04:50,400 --> 07:04:52,800
What are you doing in the middle of this blasted war?

6765
07:04:56,140 --> 07:04:59,520
The same thing I've been doing, slowing these bastards down.

6766
07:05:00,880 --> 07:05:08,480
me pitched in a little bit this war would have been well
over by now that may be so but this is a matter between gods

6767
07:05:08,480 --> 07:05:18,520

late for that melee anyway what does he give me oh shit i've

6772
07:05:44,130 --> 07:05:45,410
Yeah, two.

6773
07:05:45,830 --> 07:05:46,770
Three would be...

6774
07:05:46,770 --> 07:05:47,690
Guys, we're not...

6775
07:05:47,690 --> 07:05:47,950
No.

6776
07:05:49,390 --> 07:05:51,950
But it'd be so funny, though.

6777
07:05:56,580 --> 07:05:57,180
Alright.

6778
07:05:57,480 --> 07:05:59,540
Deal more damage, and it flicked freeze.

6779
07:06:00,320 --> 07:06:01,500
I do use my special.

6780
07:06:03,160 --> 07:06:03,840
Oh, wait.

6781
07:06:04,620 --> 07:06:06,260
Am I going to get six encounters in time?

6782
07:06:07,280 --> 07:06:07,760
Chat?

6783
07:06:08,320 --> 07:06:08,880
Or do I do...

6784
07:06:08,920 --> 07:06:14,340
It was nice, but nicer if it was rare.

6785
07:06:16,680 --> 07:06:16,960
What?

6786
07:06:17,100 --> 07:06:18,160
Get six encounters?

6787
07:06:20,220 --> 07:06:21,860
Two sucks as a common boon?

6788
07:06:23,760 --> 07:06:24,140
Oh.

6789
07:06:27,940 --> 07:06:29,640
I got plenty of encounters.

6790
07:06:29,920 --> 07:06:32,320
Okay, if I get plenty of encounters, I'll risk it.

6791
07:06:33,540 --> 07:06:34,860
Oh, grab the ash.

6792
07:06:41,480 --> 07:06:42,820

6793
07:06:42,920 --> 07:06:45,000

Like, I legitimately, I forgot.

6796
07:06:49,980 --> 07:06:52,040
I don't know what my fucking build is.

6797
07:06:52,960 --> 07:06:55,280
I actually don't know my build right now.

6798
07:06:55,620 --> 07:06:56,740
I'm so confused.

6799
07:06:59,460 --> 07:07:00,620
Oh, I could have upgraded that.

6800
07:07:00,780 --> 07:07:01,140
Fuck.

6801
07:07:02,260 --> 07:07:03,420
I forgot about the upgrade shit.

6802
07:07:04,500 --> 07:07:05,540
Oh, no.

6803
07:07:10,940 --> 07:07:12,780
I don't have a lot of stuff, though.

6804
07:07:16,750 --> 07:07:18,610
Oh, I see Octopus too.

6805
07:07:18,730 --> 07:07:19,710
Oh, wait, what?

6806
07:07:20,670 --> 07:07:22,730

07:07:36,980 --> 07:07:37,980
Oh my god, wake up.

6809
07:07:49,770 --> 07:07:52,810
Okay, I was not expecting auto-aim there.

6810
07:07:56,020 --> 07:07:59,200
Okay, I need the cat's help.

6811

Okay, I'll do one.

6820
07:09:06,360 --> 07:09:07,580
I'll get that barrier.

6821
07:09:08,060 --> 07:09:10,240
Oh, I didn't see the fucking talk.

6822
07:09:11,560 --> 07:09:11,860

07:09:11,940 --> 07:09:13,200
I'll grab the tree branch.

6824
07:09:14,440 --> 07:09:15,600
I'll grab this guy, too.

6825
07:09:15,860 --> 07:09:16,760
It'll be all right.

6826
07:09:24,180 --> 07:09:24,880
All right, there you go.

6827
07:09:26,440 --> 07:09:34,720
A black ship darkest of them all I hate that hound Olympus,
yet none dare engage with it for long.

6828
07:09:34,820 --> 07:09:35,300
Yeah, I said three.

6829
07:09:35,460 --> 07:09:36,080
Sorry, I can't count.

6830
07:09:38,400 --> 07:09:39,660
I can't count.

6831
07:09:39,780 --> 07:09:41,160
I'm bad at counting, guys.

6832
07:09:42,120 --> 07:09:43,400
Good evening, Boatman.

6833
07:09:45,640 --> 07:09:46,080
Okay.

6834
07:09:48,020 --> 07:09:50,220
And make one and random boon.

6835
07:09:50,480 --> 07:09:50,860
All right.

6836
07:09:52,340 --> 07:09:52,860
Two.

6837
07:09:53,480 --> 07:09:54,540
We take the Gamba.

6838
07:09:55,640 --> 07:09:56,540
It's time.

6839
07:09:59,080 --> 07:10:00,300
It's Gamba time.

6840
07:10:00,400 --> 07:10:02,660
What the fuck is that?

6841
07:10:04,140 --> 07:10:04,900
Oh, shit!

6842
07:10:05,500 --> 07:10:06,540
Wait, that's good Gamba.

6843
07:10:07,220 --> 07:10:07,980
Good Gamba!

6844
07:10:09,780 --> 07:10:10,100
Okay.

6845
07:10:16,090 --> 07:10:17,410
Oh, bad Gamba!

6846
07:10:17,830 --> 07:10:19,570
Okay, not really.

6847
07:10:20,010 --> 07:10:21,530
Okay, mediocre Gamba.

6848
07:10:22,050 --> 07:10:22,930
Average Gamba.

6849
07:10:23,330 --> 07:10:23,770
Average.

6850
07:10:28,270 --> 07:10:29,730
Average Gamba.

6851
07:10:29,910 --> 07:10:30,470
Let's go.

6852
07:10:39,520 --> 07:10:40,360
Okay.

6853
07:10:42,060 --> 07:10:48,400

I have eight?

6858
07:11:23,300 --> 07:11:24,320
I don't have eight anything.

6859
07:11:24,780 --> 07:11:25,820
I'm not close.

6860
07:11:26,180 --> 07:11:27,040
Alright, attacks.

6861
07:11:27,880 --> 07:11:29,140
Alright, attacks faster.

6862
07:11:29,520 --> 07:11:30,240
That's always good.

6863
07:11:30,640 --> 07:11:31,440
Oh, wait, it's this.

6864
07:11:32,280 --> 07:11:32,720
Earn it?

6865
07:11:32,820 --> 07:11:34,480
I'll slay you all without a scratch.

6866
07:11:34,780 --> 07:11:35,800
I don't earn it.

6867
07:11:38,180 --> 07:11:39,940
Oh, that's how I earned it.

6868
07:11:40,460 --> 07:11:40,840
Alright.

6869
07:11:44,100 --> 07:11:45,240
Alright, we gotta...

6870
07:11:47,340 --> 07:11:47,820
No!

6871
07:11:47,960 --> 07:11:48,780
Without getting hit!

6872
07:11:49,580 --> 07:11:53,720
Oh, so close.

6873
07:11:55,260 --> 07:11:56,700
I got an onion.

6874
07:11:58,360 --> 07:11:58,500
Yay.

6875
07:12:00,020 --> 07:12:01,220
I was so close.

6876
07:12:01,540 --> 07:12:02,500
I was got cocky.

6877
07:12:02,660 --> 07:12:04,220
I got really cocky there.

6878
07:12:05,280 --> 07:12:06,680
Oh, it was literally two.

6879
07:12:07,420 --> 07:12:09,760
I got, I got two cocky.

6880
07:12:09,940 --> 07:12:11,520
I was like, you can't hit me.

6881
07:12:12,820 --> 07:12:14,140
I'm so strong.

6882
07:12:14,860 --> 07:12:16,880
I was not so strong.

6883
07:12:19,240 --> 07:12:20,760
I can Blitz as well?

6884
07:12:21,840 --> 07:12:23,840
Yeah, I should have played at range.

6885
07:12:24,440 --> 07:12:25,640
I just got too confident.

6886
07:12:28,140 --> 07:12:29,860
I got way too confident.

6887
07:12:30,100 --> 07:12:31,700
All right, either armor and moon.

6888
07:12:32,580 --> 07:12:40,460
I feel like moon because I need I haven't encountered a
single moon upgrade yet and like I need to upgrade my uh I

6889
07:12:40,460 --> 07:12:50,880
really need to upgrade the moon thing the summons the
possibilities Backstone is 75 Faster.

6890
07:12:52,920 --> 07:12:53,220
Okay.

6891
07:12:53,840 --> 07:12:55,000
We're gonna grab this then.

6892
07:12:56,800 --> 07:12:57,940
We have to grab that.

6893
07:12:58,520 --> 07:12:59,460
The attack's faster.

6894
07:13:00,620 --> 07:13:02,200
Okay, we might use a death defiance here.

6895
07:13:02,460 --> 07:13:03,360
I'm not confident.

6896
07:13:06,120 --> 07:13:07,700
I'm not confident here.

6897
07:13:09,720 --> 07:13:10,700
What took you so long?

6898
07:13:11,960 --> 07:13:14,300
Give back the golden apple that you took from me last time.

6899
07:13:14,580 --> 07:13:15,800
And I might just let you walk this way.

6900
07:13:15,800 --> 07:13:16,680
Thank you for the raid.

6901
07:13:16,940 --> 07:13:17,160
Thank you.

6902
07:13:19,360 --> 07:13:20,160
Which one?

6903
07:13:20,300 --> 07:13:20,880
I already ate it.

6904
07:13:22,100 --> 07:13:24,640
How many golden apples are here anyway?

6905
07:13:25,080 --> 07:13:28,320
It doesn't seem so rare if I get to get one every time I
kill you.

6906
07:13:29,020 --> 07:13:30,760
Life starts to get a lot more interesting.

6907
07:13:30,800 --> 07:13:31,900
What if I already ate it?

6908
07:13:32,100 --> 07:13:34,640
You don't always need an invitation to show up.

6909
07:13:35,840 --> 07:13:36,600
Keep the apple then.

6910
07:13:37,080 --> 07:13:38,440
I've got a whole lot more.

6911
07:13:38,940 --> 07:13:39,360
What?

6912
07:13:43,060 --> 07:13:44,740
Oh my god, I'm so scared.

6913
07:13:46,440 --> 07:13:47,860
Oh, I'm scared of her.

6914
07:13:49,720 --> 07:13:50,200
I'm...

6915
07:13:51,820 --> 07:13:53,020

6916
07:13:56,610 --> 07:13:57,990

I was like, you got this!

6924
07:14:40,740 --> 07:14:42,460
That's the shot my own teammate.

6925
07:14:44,800 --> 07:14:45,800
I got...

6926
07:14:45,800 --> 07:14:47,140
No, that's my own teammate again!

6927
07:14:48,060 --> 07:14:49,920
I keep accidentally shooting her.

6928
07:14:53,920 --> 07:14:54,520
Okay.

6929
07:14:54,700 --> 07:14:55,380
Oh, my God.

6930
07:14:55,500 --> 07:14:56,060
Please not again.

6931
07:14:56,840 --> 07:14:57,420

Okay.

6937
07:15:15,970 --> 07:15:16,970
Oh, my God.

6938
07:15:17,610 --> 07:15:18,270
I'm so scared.

6939
07:15:19,410 --> 07:15:20,030
Where is she?

6940
07:15:25,900 --> 07:15:26,480
Oh, my God.

6941
07:15:26,540 --> 07:15:27,080
Where is she?

6942
07:15:29,100 --> 07:15:29,920
Oh, no.

6943
07:15:30,500 --> 07:15:30,860
Oh, no.

6944
07:15:30,920 --> 07:15:31,800
I'm going to die to a goon.

6945
07:15:32,680 --> 07:15:33,280
Oh, no.

6946
07:15:33,640 --> 07:15:33,800
No.

6947
07:15:33,940 --> 07:15:34,340
Oh,

6948
07:15:38,590 --> 07:15:39,570
I was so scared.

6949
07:15:40,370 --> 07:15:42,310
I was 13 HP in a dream.

6950
07:15:43,910 --> 07:15:44,270
Oh.

6951
07:15:45,310 --> 07:15:46,850
I got an upgrade, too.

6952
07:15:48,210 --> 07:15:49,730
I was not okay.

6953
07:15:50,310 --> 07:15:52,090
My cat clutched it.

6954
07:15:54,790 --> 07:15:55,830
Come on, Tula.

6955
07:15:58,070 --> 07:16:00,050
No, I was spamming that shit.

6956
07:16:04,180 --> 07:16:05,820
I definitely need the heals.

6957
07:16:06,920 --> 07:16:08,280
And we're grabbing...

6958
07:16:08,280 --> 07:16:09,100
Wait, what do I grab?

6959
07:16:09,560 --> 07:16:10,700
The tooth.

6960
07:16:11,000 --> 07:16:12,000
We're grabbing the tooth.

6961
07:16:12,640 --> 07:16:15,200
So we have four depth defiances now.

6962
07:16:15,620 --> 07:16:16,060
Uh...

6963
07:16:18,620 --> 07:16:20,300
Or we could do the evil eye.

6964
07:16:21,060 --> 07:16:21,700
Which is more.

6965
07:16:22,560 --> 07:16:23,660
Which you think is better.

6966
07:16:23,960 --> 07:16:24,980
Evil eye or the tooth?

6967
07:16:41,540 --> 07:16:42,120
Evil eye?

6968
07:16:42,400 --> 07:16:43,330
Alright, we'll try it.

6969
07:16:47,400 --> 07:16:47,740
Okay.

6970
07:16:48,780 --> 07:16:50,200
Might not do so well.

6971
07:16:52,800 --> 07:16:54,300
Alright, we'll try our best.

6972
07:16:57,200 --> 07:16:57,560
Okay.

6973
07:16:57,860 --> 07:16:58,780
Up we go.

6974
07:17:01,460 --> 07:17:02,820
That's not your property.

6975
07:17:03,380 --> 07:17:03,960
Okay.

6976
07:17:05,080 --> 07:17:06,960
All right, there we go.

6977
07:17:09,300 --> 07:17:09,980
Oh my god.

6978
07:17:10,500 --> 07:17:11,760
Oh my god.

6979
07:17:11,960 --> 07:17:14,080
You're not expecting to follow me there.

6980
07:17:17,320 --> 07:17:18,100
Oh, money.

6981
07:17:18,720 --> 07:17:19,400
Ooh, hammer.

6982
07:17:20,320 --> 07:17:21,480
All right, hammer time.

6983
07:17:23,880 --> 07:17:24,620
There they are.

6984
07:17:25,660 --> 07:17:26,560
All right, there we go.

6985
07:17:27,200 --> 07:17:28,180
Jesus Christ.

6986
07:17:29,780 --> 07:17:31,200
I take those.

6987
07:17:32,040 --> 07:17:34,260
Oh my god, yeah, I know I take those.

6988
07:17:38,360 --> 07:17:39,000
100%.

6989
07:17:39,000 --> 07:17:39,720
Okay.

6990
07:17:41,340 --> 07:17:42,140
Where's the hammer?

6991
07:17:42,480 --> 07:17:42,760
Oh, hey!

6992
07:17:43,260 --> 07:17:45,720
Mining, mining, mining.

6993
07:17:47,240 --> 07:17:47,880
Hammer time!

6994
07:17:49,800 --> 07:17:52,200
That's hit two, but you use five.

6995
07:17:52,220 --> 07:17:53,200
I don't use a lot.

6996
07:17:53,320 --> 07:17:55,700
Your special fires, two projectiles, your balance.

6997
07:17:55,880 --> 07:17:56,160
Oh!

6998
07:17:57,680 --> 07:17:58,640
Two foes.

6999
07:17:59,760 --> 07:18:00,400
Dealing.

7000
07:18:01,060 --> 07:18:01,400
Plus.

7001
07:18:06,620 --> 07:18:07,960

Born again.

7017
07:20:05,710 --> 07:20:06,770
Divine intervention?

7018
07:20:08,090 --> 07:20:08,230
Oh.

7019
07:20:08,730 --> 07:20:09,310
Oh, shit.

07:20:09,870 --> 07:20:10,130
Yay!

7021
07:20:12,830 --> 07:20:14,470
Hello, Athena.

7022
07:20:15,150 --> 07:20:16,250
Free stuff time.

07:20:16,710 --> 07:20:17,810
Oh, I forgot to give the...

7024
07:20:17,810 --> 07:20:18,650
God damn it.

7025
07:20:19,530 --> 07:20:21,170
I forgot to give her stuff.

7026
07:20:21,290 --> 07:20:22,070
We're planning, doesn't he?

7027
07:20:22,470 --> 07:20:23,990
And can retaliate accordingly.

7028
07:20:25,650 --> 07:20:27,430
He knows what is to come to some extent.

7029
07:20:27,570 --> 07:20:28,270
I already talked to her.

7030
07:20:28,310 --> 07:20:29,390
She's gonna leave now.

7031
07:20:30,450 --> 07:20:31,330
I got too excited.

7032
07:20:31,570 --> 07:20:34,270
And just because he knows you're coming doesn't mean he can
stop you.

7033
07:20:36,270 --> 07:20:36,490
Alright.

7034
07:20:42,760 --> 07:20:43,640
Oh, wait.

7035
07:20:45,780 --> 07:20:47,160
Four death defiances?

07:20:47,980 --> 07:20:48,860
Oh, wait.

The sheer might of the moon.

7046
07:22:07,500 --> 07:22:09,040
Uh, Demeter or Zeus, guys?

7047
07:22:13,930 --> 07:22:14,730
Demeter or Zeus?

7048
07:22:17,550 --> 07:22:19,670
I don't know what I need for my build.

7049
07:22:22,230 --> 07:22:25,410
Alright, let's hope the boss is not that scary.

7050
07:22:25,710 --> 07:22:26,770
Oh my god.

7051
07:22:27,750 --> 07:22:28,030
Okay.

7052
07:22:30,410 --> 07:22:32,390
Okay, I don't like this boss.

7053
07:22:32,810 --> 07:22:36,430
And, uh, we're gonna wake her up.

7054
07:22:38,030 --> 07:22:40,030
This boss actually fucks me up, though.

7055
07:22:43,130 --> 07:22:45,190
This boss fucks me up a lot.

7056
07:22:50,780 --> 07:22:51,880
I'm really- Oh, wait, hey, plant.

7057
07:22:53,740 --> 07:22:55,220
Okay, but plant, though.

7058
07:23:00,430 --> 07:23:03,010
Try not to, like, die too easily.

7059
07:23:07,360 --> 07:23:07,900
God damn it.

7060
07:23:07,900 --> 07:23:08,400
Oh, my God.

7061
07:23:08,480 --> 07:23:09,040
That scared me.

7062
07:23:11,040 --> 07:23:12,200
Okay, I'm okay, okay.

7063
07:23:13,600 --> 07:23:15,340
I was like, what the fuck happened to me?

7064
07:23:15,760 --> 07:23:16,420
Okay, there we go.

7065
07:23:17,160 --> 07:23:19,720
Okay, now, now it's over for you.

7066
07:23:24,750 --> 07:23:25,270
Boom!

7067
07:23:26,630 --> 07:23:27,090
There we go.

7068
07:23:27,150 --> 07:23:29,110
I prefer drakens that cannot fly.

7069
07:23:34,120 --> 07:23:35,160
Jesus Christ.

7070
07:23:36,160 --> 07:23:37,360
This better be worth it.

7071
07:23:37,980 --> 07:23:39,020
So I'm 45!

7072
07:23:39,760 --> 07:23:43,580
I could have done three of those and do less.

7073
07:23:43,740 --> 07:23:46,340
A lofty mountain is not easily besieged.

7074
07:23:46,660 --> 07:23:52,000
So the crafty titan of time saw to wing it beasts
susceptible to his persuasion.

7075
07:23:52,300 --> 07:23:55,220
All right, just better give me some good shit From the
skies.

7076
07:23:56,060 --> 07:23:56,520
All right, Zeus.

7077
07:23:56,540 --> 07:23:58,080
Looks like they've made themselves at home.

7078
07:23:58,420 --> 07:24:01,000
My command of the heavens is nothing compared to the strict.

7079
07:24:01,000 --> 07:24:02,200
Oh, is this duo of Hera?

7080
07:24:02,800 --> 07:24:06,140
The queen and I have struck together through worse times
than this.

7081
07:24:06,740 --> 07:24:07,380
Oh, duo!

7082
07:24:11,060 --> 07:24:13,500
We've stood together now through more hard times than I can
tell.

7083
07:24:14,860 --> 07:24:16,580
She talked about his ways.

7084
07:24:16,660 --> 07:24:23,540

now his other girlfriends and boyfriends all right what the

she literally came over just to talk to me too and i was
like um so um the thing is You know, your thing is not

7091
07:25:28,670 --> 07:25:32,110
better than the other duo, so I'm sorry.

7092
07:25:32,330 --> 07:25:33,490
I gotta pick that one.

7093
07:25:38,540 --> 07:25:39,420
These palms are even...

7094
07:25:39,980 --> 07:25:41,580
You kind of suck.

7095
07:25:44,220 --> 07:25:44,440
Alright.

7096
07:25:45,660 --> 07:25:45,800
Oh.

7097
07:25:49,180 --> 07:25:50,420
One or three.

7098
07:25:50,840 --> 07:25:51,960
I don't think I need more...

7099
07:25:51,960 --> 07:25:54,360
I don't think Prime really affects me too much.

7100
07:25:55,460 --> 07:25:55,840
Two?

7101
07:25:57,160 --> 07:25:58,360
Two or one.

7102
07:25:59,000 --> 07:26:00,060
I only need three.

7103
07:26:04,910 --> 07:26:05,770
Inflict splits.

7104
07:26:05,930 --> 07:26:07,030
More blitz, though.

7105
07:26:07,370 --> 07:26:07,610
Yeah.

7106
07:26:09,110 --> 07:26:09,670
More blitz.

7107
07:26:09,790 --> 07:26:11,250
I'll get the blitz just because it's more.

7108
07:26:12,630 --> 07:26:14,330
Grab the shop, too.

7109
07:26:17,490 --> 07:26:18,050
Um...

7110
07:26:18,050 --> 07:26:21,030
I don't know if...

7111
07:26:21,590 --> 07:26:22,650
I don't have enough...

7112
07:26:22,650 --> 07:26:23,670
Do I have enough money?

7113
07:26:25,050 --> 07:26:26,210
I think I do.

7114
07:26:30,520 --> 07:26:31,200
Oh, yeah.

Have a feeling.

7148
07:29:12,380 --> 07:29:14,260

07:30:48,900 --> 07:30:50,220
That has to be the final room.

7164
07:30:50,380 --> 07:30:50,680

07:31:57,780 --> 07:31:59,180
Alright, here we go.

Oh, I'm a little...

7177
07:32:01,820 --> 07:32:02,580
I don't know.

7178
07:32:02,880 --> 07:32:03,540
I don't know.

7179
07:32:03,680 --> 07:32:04,320
I feel like...

7180
07:32:04,320 --> 07:32:05,460
I don't know if this is the run.

7181
07:32:11,020 --> 07:32:12,040
It's the bird.

7182
07:32:12,200 --> 07:32:12,560
It's the...

7183
07:32:12,580 --> 07:32:13,520
fucking bird.

7184
07:32:21,620 --> 07:32:25,680
At least the bird didn't fucking crash the party.

7185
07:32:26,040 --> 07:32:28,880
Didn't party crash this time, while it came over.

7186
07:32:32,140 --> 07:32:34,420
What would you know of my plight?

7187
07:32:34,860 --> 07:32:37,000
You who flail against time itself?

7188
07:32:37,860 --> 07:32:39,760
So much courage born of pride.

7189
07:32:40,000 --> 07:32:41,800
That's why he has fiery powers, I just realized.

7190
07:32:45,640 --> 07:32:47,600
God damn memory game.

7191
07:32:48,260 --> 07:32:48,260
Yeah.

7192
07:32:48,280 --> 07:32:48,460
God.

7193
07:32:49,080 --> 07:32:49,660
Oh my god.

7194
07:32:50,120 --> 07:32:51,060
Oh my god.

7195
07:32:51,500 --> 07:32:52,340
Oh my god.

7196
07:32:52,600 --> 07:32:53,240
Oh my god.

7197
07:32:53,240 --> 07:32:53,520
Oh my god.

7198
07:32:53,700 --> 07:32:55,600
The goddamn fucking bird.

7199
07:32:57,340 --> 07:32:58,200
Where's my cat?

7200
07:32:59,240 --> 07:33:00,480
Where's my cat?

7201
07:33:08,050 --> 07:33:08,810
Okay.

7202
07:33:11,450 --> 07:33:12,770
Are you fucking kidding me?

7203
07:33:15,910 --> 07:33:18,220
Oh my god, are you fucking kidding me?

7204
07:33:21,610 --> 07:33:22,810
My cat's in the fire.

7205
07:33:23,290 --> 07:33:24,890
I can't do anything about it.

7206
07:33:26,270 --> 07:33:27,490
Cat's in the fucking fire.

7207
07:33:28,770 --> 07:33:29,250
There you go.

7208
07:33:31,010 --> 07:33:31,470
Oh, there you go.

7209
07:33:31,810 --> 07:33:32,470
Memory game time.

7210
07:33:34,210 --> 07:33:34,490
Middle.

7211
07:33:35,010 --> 07:33:35,330

7212
07:33:36,550 --> 07:33:36,790

Middle.

7226
07:34:39,440 --> 07:34:39,660
Top.

7227
07:34:42,660 --> 07:34:43,460
Middle, top, bottom.

7228
07:34:43,940 --> 07:34:44,300
Oh, my God.

7229
07:34:45,660 --> 07:34:45,880
Top.

7230
07:34:47,020 --> 07:34:47,420
Bottom.

7231
07:34:48,640 --> 07:34:49,020

7234
07:34:52,260 --> 07:34:52,580

7239
07:35:27,940 --> 07:35:30,240
He was way too fast.

7240
07:35:31,020 --> 07:35:31,800
I tried.

7241
07:35:32,360 --> 07:35:33,460
I really tried.

7242
07:35:35,120 --> 07:35:37,260
He was just too fast.

7243
07:35:41,460 --> 07:35:42,140
Okay.

7244
07:35:44,080 --> 07:35:46,200
Oh my god, I used up all my primes.

7245
07:35:50,560 --> 07:35:51,580
Oh my god.

7246
07:35:52,540 --> 07:35:53,560
Oh, is it over?

7247
07:35:54,280 --> 07:35:56,040
Is there a face too?

7248
07:35:56,180 --> 07:35:57,060
I knew this would happen.

7249
07:35:57,820 --> 07:35:59,140
Yet I could not prevent it

7250
07:36:02,530 --> 07:36:03,070
part.

7251
07:36:03,370 --> 07:36:04,310
Oh, he's bleeding.

7252
07:36:05,010 --> 07:36:06,070
Oh my god, he's bleeding!

7253
07:36:06,270 --> 07:36:07,210
I'm gonna take your liver!

7254
07:36:08,250 --> 07:36:09,270
I did it!

7255
07:36:12,510 --> 07:36:12,950
Silence.

7256
07:36:13,670 --> 07:36:15,550
Save your troubles for your master Kronos.

7257
07:36:17,970 --> 07:36:18,330
It's okay.

7258
07:36:18,550 --> 07:36:18,990
He's bleeding.

7259
07:36:19,130 --> 07:36:20,490
I could take his fucking...

7260
07:36:20,490 --> 07:36:21,810
It's not my troubles that I mean to save.

7261
07:36:22,630 --> 07:36:23,870
An agent of change.

7262
07:36:24,570 --> 07:36:25,770
He can bleed.

7263
07:36:27,310 --> 07:36:27,910
Yeah!

7264
07:36:30,330 --> 07:36:30,710
Yeah!

7265
07:36:33,370 --> 07:36:34,570
Ha ha!

7266
07:36:35,470 --> 07:36:35,890
He's gone.

7267
07:36:36,730 --> 07:36:37,890
Okay, I saw two more.

7268
07:36:40,550 --> 07:36:43,770
No trace remains now of the titan of Fawcite.

7269
07:36:44,190 --> 07:36:45,610
We'll pull out his goddamn liver.

7270
07:36:45,950 --> 07:36:48,250
Save for a single feather left behind.

7271
07:36:48,890 --> 07:36:52,090
As if to go the princess on toward greater heights.

7272
07:36:54,250 --> 07:36:55,590
Just no more eagles, please.

7273
07:36:55,690 --> 07:36:57,250
Oh, okay, third try.

7274
07:36:57,270 --> 07:36:59,050
it took me three tries to get here.

7275
07:37:00,510 --> 07:37:02,510
I think the memory game fucked me up.

7276
07:37:05,290 --> 07:37:08,070
It's the memory game that messes me up the most.

7277
07:37:08,370 --> 07:37:09,630
Okay, now I get to have a tooth.

7278
07:37:10,410 --> 07:37:11,370
Alright, tooth time.

7279
07:37:12,430 --> 07:37:14,430
Okay, now I have three death defiances again.

7280
07:37:14,650 --> 07:37:15,310
I got three more.

7281
07:37:15,470 --> 07:37:16,510
I got three more in me.

7282
07:37:16,890 --> 07:37:17,450
Wait, is it three?

7283
07:37:17,690 --> 07:37:18,950
How many death defiances do I have?

7284
07:37:20,230 --> 07:37:21,490
I can't tell.

7285
07:37:24,370 --> 07:37:24,670
Two?

7286
07:37:25,790 --> 07:37:26,850
Wait, I used two.

7287
07:37:27,270 --> 07:37:30,410
He is too- oh my god, I didn't even realize that he's too
deaf defiances.

7288
07:37:35,820 --> 07:37:37,900
I don't even remember.

7289
07:37:41,800 --> 07:37:42,880
The summit.

7290
07:37:43,960 --> 07:37:45,820
Oh hey, that's- that's my uncle.

7291
07:37:49,860 --> 07:37:50,220
Hello?

7292
07:37:50,760 --> 07:37:51,400
Knock knock.

7293
07:37:53,720 --> 07:37:54,220
Oh no.

7294
07:37:55,820 --> 07:37:58,240
What the fuck?

7295
07:38:00,120 --> 07:38:02,940
Fuck it my- What are these?

7296
07:38:04,760 --> 07:38:07,700
That's a, oh my god, that's a good question.

7297
07:38:08,160 --> 07:38:09,680
What the fuck are these?

7298
07:38:10,420 --> 07:38:12,900
I'm also confused what they are.

7299
07:38:19,050 --> 07:38:22,930
Like, is my fucking minion doing anything, question mark?

7300
07:38:29,550 --> 07:38:31,150
What the fuck?

7301
07:38:34,510 --> 07:38:35,630
I don't even get anything out of here.

7302
07:38:35,710 --> 07:38:36,990
I don't even get anything out of here.

7303
07:38:40,570 --> 07:38:41,290
All right.

7304
07:38:42,390 --> 07:38:43,430
Like, aliens?

7305
07:38:44,670 --> 07:38:46,090
Aliens are real.

7306
07:38:47,530 --> 07:38:48,970
Oh my god.

7307
07:38:49,610 --> 07:38:50,630
They're aliens.

7308
07:38:54,110 --> 07:38:55,010
What the?

7309
07:38:56,730 --> 07:38:57,910
What the fuck was that?

7310
07:38:58,410 --> 07:38:59,810
What the fuck was that?

7311
07:39:01,010 --> 07:39:02,410
Okay, I'm getting the Pob.

7312
07:39:03,110 --> 07:39:04,570
I don't think we need more Demeter, right?

7313
07:39:05,610 --> 07:39:06,730
Unless we can get air.

7314
07:39:09,050 --> 07:39:11,370
I can't believe the Greeks got invaded by aliens.

7315
07:39:12,390 --> 07:39:13,390
Bomb or boon?

7316
07:39:22,400 --> 07:39:22,740
Meter for...

7317
07:39:22,740 --> 07:39:23,580
There's no air...

7318
07:39:23,580 --> 07:39:25,160
Someone said there's no meter for air.

7319
07:39:25,340 --> 07:39:25,560
Yeah.

7320
07:39:27,260 --> 07:39:29,020
There's no air for...

7321
07:39:29,920 --> 07:39:31,100
The meter attack?

7322
07:39:33,080 --> 07:39:34,700
The meter attack.

7323
07:39:34,960 --> 07:39:37,100
Okay, we might be able to grab an attack, though.

7324
07:39:38,600 --> 07:39:39,280
Yeah, okay.

7325
07:39:39,500 --> 07:39:40,380
Closer to the top.

7326
07:39:40,480 --> 07:39:41,140
Try this.

7327
07:39:42,300 --> 07:39:43,800
What the fuck?

7328
07:39:44,320 --> 07:39:45,680
Yeah, what the fuck?

7329
07:39:47,360 --> 07:39:48,840
What the fuck is that?

7330
07:39:50,540 --> 07:39:52,060
What the fuck?

7331
07:39:52,500 --> 07:39:53,440
What am I looking at?

7332
07:39:53,700 --> 07:39:55,380
It's like even the game doesn't know.

7333
07:39:55,680 --> 07:39:57,080
The game is like question mark.

7334
07:39:57,420 --> 07:40:01,360
Even the game is like question mark.

7335
07:40:01,420 --> 07:40:02,580
I don't even know, bro.

7336
07:40:07,840 --> 07:40:08,880
Holy shit!

7337
07:40:09,640 --> 07:40:11,940
Oh my god, I might have to use another Death Defiance
actually.

7338
07:40:14,040 --> 07:40:15,460
Oh my god!

7339

I don't like that.

7349
07:42:09,870 --> 07:42:14,470
The veins might make me a little uncomfortable, chat.

7350
07:42:17,490 --> 07:42:18,910
Just a little.

7351
07:42:19,630 --> 07:42:20,990
Jesus Christ.

7352
07:42:24,670 --> 07:42:26,530
All right, 20 HP in a dream.

7353
07:42:30,600 --> 07:42:32,720
I don't know what to expect here.

7354
07:42:33,100 --> 07:42:34,740
I just work.

7355
07:42:36,960 --> 07:42:39,160
I don't know what to expect in this world.

7356
07:42:42,000 --> 07:42:43,600
I could dig food.

7357
07:42:52,020 --> 07:42:54,220
Okay, moon, Zeus.

7358
07:42:54,880 --> 07:42:55,020
Jesus.

7359
07:42:55,540 --> 07:42:56,400
Okay, they're both.

7360
07:42:57,520 --> 07:42:58,280
They are...

7361
07:42:58,280 --> 07:43:01,720
If we do moon, we could have the last upgrade.

7362
07:43:05,640 --> 07:43:06,560
Okay, for air.

7363
07:43:06,820 --> 07:43:08,940
Yeah, we have to get the air.

7364
07:43:10,100 --> 07:43:13,360
I know this place.

7365
07:43:13,720 --> 07:43:14,420
Oh, God.

7366
07:43:14,720 --> 07:43:15,900
We're going to get Deft of Fines here.

7367
07:43:16,160 --> 07:43:17,940
No, 100%.

7368
07:43:17,940 --> 07:43:19,400
No, we are...

7369
07:43:19,400 --> 07:43:20,540
What the...

7370
07:43:22,640 --> 07:43:24,760
Oh, what the fuck?

7371
07:43:27,900 --> 07:43:28,660
Okay.

7372
07:43:31,280 --> 07:43:34,600
Literally, I am hoping the cat will wake up.

7373
07:43:36,240 --> 07:43:37,680
Oh, my God!

7374
07:43:38,240 --> 07:43:39,620
What did that do to me?

7375
07:43:49,630 --> 07:43:50,390
Okay.

7376
07:43:51,490 --> 07:43:52,550
Oh, God.

7377
07:43:53,250 --> 07:43:53,950
Cat, wake up.

7378
07:43:54,150 --> 07:44:00,250

7379
07:44:09,370 --> 07:44:15,290

07:44:18,370 --> 07:44:24,520

7381
07:44:31,780 --> 07:44:32,770

7382
07:44:36,800 --> 07:44:38,200
I don't know.

7383
07:44:39,500 --> 07:44:40,080
I don't know.

7384
07:44:40,840 --> 07:44:41,580
I just didn't know.

7385
07:44:42,060 --> 07:44:43,720
I- Oh my god!

7386
07:44:47,380 --> 07:44:48,040
Shit!

7387
07:44:49,080 --> 07:44:50,020
Where's my cat?

7388
07:44:50,920 --> 07:44:52,740
He needs to come in right now.

7389
07:44:53,580 --> 07:44:55,080
I am very scared.

7390
07:44:58,040 --> 07:45:00,060
I am very scared, buddy.

7391
07:45:04,990 --> 07:45:05,950
Oh god.

7392
07:45:07,050 --> 07:45:07,670
Oh god.

7393
07:45:08,970 --> 07:45:09,790
Oh, God.

7394
07:45:10,190 --> 07:45:11,230
I'm not going to make it.

7395
07:45:12,650 --> 07:45:14,150
I'm not going to make it.

7396
07:45:14,950 --> 07:45:15,370
Oh, my God.

7397
07:45:15,490 --> 07:45:16,390
I don't know what that does.

7398
07:45:17,070 --> 07:45:17,850
I know for sure.

7399
07:45:17,970 --> 07:45:18,750
I'm not going to make it.

7400
07:45:24,580 --> 07:45:25,720
I'm behind him.

7401
07:45:29,600 --> 07:45:29,820
Oh, God.

7402
07:45:31,760 --> 07:45:32,480
Oh, God.

7403
07:45:32,800 --> 07:45:33,880
He's getting closer, isn't he?

7404
07:45:41,260 --> 07:45:42,600
Oh, thank God.

7405
07:45:45,220 --> 07:45:45,660
Okay.

7406
07:45:46,380 --> 07:45:47,520
At least I get to see them.

7407
07:45:47,620 --> 07:45:49,800
You know, at the end, I get...

7408
07:45:50,920 --> 07:45:53,460
At least I get to see him at the end.

7409
07:45:54,180 --> 07:45:56,620
I beat question mark, question mark.

7410
07:45:58,840 --> 07:45:59,320
Okay.

7411
07:46:00,040 --> 07:46:01,060
That's good, actually.

7412
07:46:02,020 --> 07:46:03,040
Wait, hold the cast.

7413
07:46:03,320 --> 07:46:03,680
Wait, hold...

7414
07:46:03,680 --> 07:46:04,660
Wait, I... Two, right?

7415
07:46:10,670 --> 07:46:11,130
Two.

7416
07:46:12,130 --> 07:46:12,610
Okay.

7417
07:46:13,610 --> 07:46:15,910
At least I get to see the boss this time.

7418
07:46:16,090 --> 07:46:17,750
Okay, I think I have enough.

7419
07:46:18,370 --> 07:46:19,690
I have no more death defiances.

7420
07:46:19,890 --> 07:46:21,170
That was my last one.

7421
07:46:21,990 --> 07:46:23,510
At least I get to see it.

7422
07:46:23,650 --> 07:46:23,890
Oh, hey!

7423
07:46:24,830 --> 07:46:25,330
Hey, Hermes.

7424
07:46:27,970 --> 07:46:28,930
Okay, um...

7425
07:46:28,930 --> 07:46:30,210
What the fuck is this?

7426
07:46:30,770 --> 07:46:31,710
Oh, Death Defiance.

7427
07:46:32,590 --> 07:46:34,290
I mean, if we're Death Defiance,

7428
07:46:38,180 --> 07:46:38,660
and...

7429
07:46:38,660 --> 07:46:39,640
I'll talk to you.

7430
07:46:41,320 --> 07:46:50,820
Okay, I can buy a Deftify's schedule armor or pub.

7431
07:46:51,000 --> 07:46:51,540
I don't...

7432
07:46:51,540 --> 07:46:53,120
Don't give me HP, so that's...

7433
07:46:54,460 --> 07:46:55,980
I'm a little scared.

7434
07:47:01,560 --> 07:47:05,360
Oh, Father of all monsters.

7435
07:47:05,580 --> 07:47:06,860
Oh, God, that's why it looks like that.

7436
07:47:09,840 --> 07:47:11,200
Oh, he's not going to give me anything.

7437
07:47:11,480 --> 07:47:12,180
Oh, my God.

7438
07:47:12,840 --> 07:47:13,060
Okay.

7439
07:47:14,340 --> 07:47:14,780
Guys.

7440
07:47:17,040 --> 07:47:19,200
Armor or double palm.

7441
07:47:19,680 --> 07:47:20,380
Do you think armor?

7442
07:47:20,740 --> 07:47:21,680
I think armor.

7443
07:47:23,540 --> 07:47:26,760
The plus $5 is not going to save it.

7444
07:47:33,200 --> 07:47:34,060
Armor and Hera?

7445
07:47:35,420 --> 07:47:36,420
Or Palm?

7446
07:47:41,500 --> 07:47:42,820
Armor and Hera?

7447
07:47:43,040 --> 07:47:43,920
All right, let's go.

7448
07:47:47,640 --> 07:47:47,880
Okay.

7449
07:47:50,280 --> 07:47:51,360
I have...

7450
07:47:53,380 --> 07:47:56,360
Okay, so I don't have two for Hestia.

7451
07:47:56,620 --> 07:47:57,820
Does that still count?

7452
07:47:58,680 --> 07:47:59,400
Okay.

7453
07:48:06,100 --> 07:48:07,500
This is a little weird, bad.

7454
07:48:07,600 --> 07:48:08,360
No, it doesn't, right?

7455
07:48:08,380 --> 07:48:09,340
I need...

7456
07:48:09,340 --> 07:48:10,280
Oh, my God.

7457
07:48:10,480 --> 07:48:11,380
I just...

7458
07:48:11,380 --> 07:48:13,300
Oh, that sucks!

7459
07:48:15,940 --> 07:48:16,280
Okay.

7460
07:48:23,090 --> 07:48:23,430
Oh.

7461
07:48:25,050 --> 07:48:25,390
One.

7462
07:48:25,530 --> 07:48:26,250
All right, here we go.

7463
07:48:29,110 --> 07:48:29,870
All right, here we go.

7464
07:48:30,130 --> 07:48:31,410
At least I can see him, you know?

7465
07:48:31,630 --> 07:48:32,270
I don't know.

7466
07:48:32,370 --> 07:48:34,610
I don't think I'm going to beat him, but I get to see him.

7467
07:48:38,170 --> 07:48:39,010
Let's see what he looks like.

7468
07:48:39,030 --> 07:48:39,390
What?

7469
07:48:42,910 --> 07:48:43,810
Oh, Jesus.

7470
07:48:44,410 --> 07:48:45,830
Okay, I don't know his patterns, dude.

7471
07:48:46,010 --> 07:48:47,030
That's the worst part.

7472
07:48:51,130 --> 07:48:51,490
Yeah.

7473
07:48:51,810 --> 07:48:58,990
Let's just do this, I think.

7474
07:49:00,630 --> 07:49:02,670
Oh my god.

7475
07:49:03,410 --> 07:49:04,570
Yeah, this...

7476
07:49:04,570 --> 07:49:05,610
It's just another foe.

7477
07:49:06,150 --> 07:49:06,690
Jesus!

7478
07:49:09,450 --> 07:49:10,570
What the?

7479
07:49:10,590 --> 07:49:11,610
Fuck!

7480
07:49:15,410 --> 07:49:16,210
Alright.

7481
07:49:18,750 --> 07:49:20,470
Are you fucking kidding me?

7482
07:49:26,030 --> 07:49:26,550
Okay.

7483
07:49:29,310 --> 07:49:30,330
Oh my god.

7484
07:49:30,870 --> 07:49:32,130
Oh my god.

7485
07:49:34,890 --> 07:49:36,330
Oh, this is so bad.

7486
07:49:37,590 --> 07:49:38,990
It's so bad.

7487
07:49:39,470 --> 07:49:41,550
This is so bad for me, guys.

7488
07:49:46,890 --> 07:49:56,450
oh my god take the food cat wake up oh my are

7489
07:50:01,080 --> 07:50:10,550

7490
07:50:17,320 --> 07:50:22,700
oh my god what's

7491
07:50:50,270 --> 07:50:50,830
going on.

7492
07:50:53,310 --> 07:50:53,590
Oh, God.

7493
07:50:54,210 --> 07:50:54,310
No!

7494
07:50:54,930 --> 07:50:55,530
I'm dead.

7495
07:50:56,750 --> 07:50:57,190
I'm dead.

7496
07:51:01,950 --> 07:51:02,310
I'm dead.

7497
07:51:03,950 --> 07:51:04,270
I'm dead.

7498
07:51:13,530 --> 07:51:18,150
I was so close.

7499
07:51:19,350 --> 07:51:21,450
I was so close.

7500
07:51:22,570 --> 07:51:27,170
I've trained to slay Kronos, not the father of all Oh my
god, we were just there.

7501
07:51:27,770 --> 07:51:28,630
Oh my god.

7502
07:51:31,790 --> 07:51:32,450
Holy shit.

7503
07:51:32,730 --> 07:51:33,990
We were so close.

7504
07:51:35,970 --> 07:51:39,090
There was like so many projectiles, yeah.

7505
07:51:39,170 --> 07:51:39,930
Go for a jog.

7506
07:51:40,390 --> 07:51:41,210
That seems nice.

7507
07:51:41,310 --> 07:51:42,150
Having legs.

7508
07:51:42,670 --> 07:51:43,730
Getting the heart rate going.

7509
07:51:43,790 --> 07:51:46,050
Oh, that was so many projectiles.

7510
07:51:48,050 --> 07:51:49,110
I think I could do it.

7511
07:51:49,170 --> 07:51:50,190
I think I could do it.

7512
07:51:50,370 --> 07:51:50,810
Next run.

7513
07:51:50,930 --> 07:51:52,590
I think the next run I could do it, actually.

7514
07:51:53,370 --> 07:51:54,770
Make something with my hands.

7515
07:51:57,330 --> 07:51:58,710
They all hit so hard.

7516
07:51:58,810 --> 07:52:01,370
I didn't realize that he would slam his fucking face down.

7517
07:52:01,470 --> 07:52:02,590
And he doesn't show his HP.

7518
07:52:05,310 --> 07:52:06,070
Take care, Dwayne.

7519
07:52:07,850 --> 07:52:08,470
If I may.

7520
07:52:09,010 --> 07:52:12,750
My sisters told me of a certain prophecy even I thought
would never come to pass.

7521
07:52:13,690 --> 07:52:17,370
That Olympus would once again face the fury of the father of
all monsters.

7522
07:52:18,130 --> 07:52:20,510
And their conflict would shake the world to its core.

7523
07:52:21,410 --> 07:52:22,390
And now it's happening.

7524
07:52:22,450 --> 07:52:23,970
How many faces does he have, though?

7525
07:52:24,150 --> 07:52:24,630
How many?

7526
07:52:25,110 --> 07:52:26,550
How many phases is this?

7527
07:52:26,810 --> 07:52:27,910
Yeah, it was a real possibility.

7528
07:52:28,730 --> 07:52:29,850
Why didn't you warn us?

7529
07:52:30,010 --> 07:52:30,830
We could have prepared.

7530
07:52:33,550 --> 07:52:34,650
That was it?

7531
07:52:34,750 --> 07:52:35,710
Okay, guys, okay.

7532
07:52:35,850 --> 07:52:37,570
If I can't do it next run, I call it.

7533
07:52:38,210 --> 07:52:41,030
I call it for next stream.

7534
07:52:42,430 --> 07:52:46,490
Though perhaps your implication is correct, and this is all
my fault.

7535
07:52:48,670 --> 07:52:49,110
What?

7536
07:52:49,490 --> 07:52:50,890
How is this all your fault?

7537
07:52:51,570 --> 07:52:57,010
Unless you aided Kronos in awakening the most notorious
fiend, the gods of faced i don't see how you had anything to

7538
07:52:57,010 --> 07:53:08,390
do with this unraveling a fateful bond i abetted your plans
to gain the surface the awakening of typhoon oh my god it

7539
07:53:08,390 --> 07:53:15,030
was the first time i thought of to defy the fates princess
that's why i didn't realize he would slam me if i knew i

7540
07:53:15,030 --> 07:53:24,290
wouldn't be up close not you what the does picking these up
even give me on black wings does the uncontrollable

7541
07:53:24,290 --> 07:53:34,490
embodiment of strife go wheresoever she may please and
lately that is often in the princess of the underworld's way

7542
07:53:34,490 --> 07:53:44,310
oh i can sell them okay making things the way they used to
be you especially you don't even know what you're missing

7543
07:53:44,310 --> 07:53:49,630
we're trying to see i should have used the omega cast but i
was panicking too because this is my first time fighting

7544
07:53:49,630 --> 07:53:57,990
again so i was like what the fuck does everything do All of
you are so obsessed with there being a point to everything.

7545
07:53:58,270 --> 07:54:00,150
You do know there isn't one, don't you?

7546
07:54:00,650 --> 07:54:02,930
Can't just let loose and have a good time.

7547
07:54:03,950 --> 07:54:04,290
All right.

7548
07:54:04,350 --> 07:54:06,150
Not under the present circumstances, no.

7549
07:54:06,470 --> 07:54:09,270
No, I am definitely not letting loose right now.

7550
07:54:12,050 --> 07:54:13,730
I'm fucking stressed.

7551
07:54:16,730 --> 07:54:17,650
All right.

7552
07:54:18,190 --> 07:54:19,690
Got the Sandine life springs.

7553
07:54:20,150 --> 07:54:21,070
Let's grab some.

7554
07:54:21,550 --> 07:54:22,770
Oh, God, I hate these fruits.

7555
07:54:23,070 --> 07:54:25,090
I hate this goddamn pitumer fruit.

7556
07:54:25,110 --> 07:54:26,510
Fruits are, like, not it.

7557
07:54:29,950 --> 07:54:32,330
Okay, I should have...

7558
07:54:32,950 --> 07:54:34,210
How much ashes do I...

7559
07:54:34,210 --> 07:54:35,350
Wait, do I have enough now?

7560
07:54:40,110 --> 07:54:41,770
I should have enough now, right?

7561
07:54:45,330 --> 07:54:45,810
Okay.

7562
07:54:46,510 --> 07:54:48,010
I want to get rid of...

7563
07:54:49,390 --> 07:54:51,290
I don't want to get rid of this.

7564
07:54:51,450 --> 07:54:51,690
Okay.

7565
07:54:53,170 --> 07:54:54,510
Okay, this should work now.

7566
07:54:56,550 --> 07:54:57,990

7567
07:54:58,010 --> 07:54:58,410

Okay.

I need five.

7574
07:55:21,180 --> 07:55:23,240
That almost worked try him!

7575
07:55:24,420 --> 07:55:26,060
Hamis told me everything.

7576
07:55:26,660 --> 07:55:28,480
Save what was going through your head.

7577
07:55:30,100 --> 07:55:31,380

made a deal with him or just revived and set him loose

7591
07:57:27,830 --> 07:57:36,530
either way when like that takes a lot of guts you sound
rather impressed i'm certain chronos would welcome you into

7592
07:57:36,530 --> 07:57:44,710
his ranks as well if you just tell him how you really feel
hit a nerve fine doesn't change the fact our enemy

7593
07:57:44,710 --> 07:57:53,030
outsmarted us so no need to keep wasting your time up top
wait you're not going to try and fight that thing are you

7594
07:57:53,030 --> 07:58:02,190

of all monsters isn't back because they're so caught up with

7598
07:58:27,560 --> 07:58:35,120
this outrageous rumor they don't buy it when i tell them
commander the thing is i confronted typhon himself just last

7599
07:58:35,120 --> 07:58:40,480
night while chrono schemes from the underworld night
monstrosity attacks a Jesus Christ.

7600
07:58:41,380 --> 07:58:43,740
Oh, I, uh, I knew all that.

7601
07:58:43,960 --> 07:58:44,740
It's just...

7602
07:58:44,740 --> 07:58:45,700
Are we lock in?

7603
07:58:46,280 --> 07:58:47,040
You fucking lock in.

7604
07:58:47,160 --> 07:58:48,040
We got this, guys.

7605
07:58:48,220 --> 07:58:50,880
To stand up for that which they truly believed.

7606
07:58:51,600 --> 07:58:52,140
And they did.

7607
07:58:52,740 --> 07:58:53,540
Nice going, everyone.

7608
07:58:54,760 --> 07:58:55,880
Okay, we can do this.

7609
07:58:57,160 --> 07:58:57,520
Yeah.

7610
07:58:58,500 --> 07:58:58,800
Yeah.

7611
07:58:59,360 --> 07:59:02,100
All right, we locked in for the final countdown.

7612
07:59:02,660 --> 07:59:03,400
Going up.

7613
07:59:04,080 --> 07:59:04,680
This is it.

7614
07:59:06,060 --> 07:59:07,000
This is...

7615
07:59:07,000 --> 07:59:08,260
It's ride or die.

7616
07:59:08,440 --> 07:59:09,400
The warrior's sigil.

7617
07:59:09,480 --> 07:59:09,860
What?

7618
07:59:10,740 --> 07:59:11,240
Oh, Athena?

7619
07:59:11,700 --> 07:59:14,040
I was beginning to think this one would never show his face.

7620
07:59:14,660 --> 07:59:15,980
In the name of his...

7621
07:59:15,980 --> 07:59:16,620
Wait, who's this?

7622
07:59:17,920 --> 07:59:18,320
Aris?

7623
07:59:20,520 --> 07:59:22,100
Oh, I finally got Aris?

7624
07:59:23,280 --> 07:59:24,440
Oh, my God.

7625
07:59:24,620 --> 07:59:25,320
It's been...

7626
07:59:25,320 --> 07:59:25,880
Oh, my God.

7627
07:59:25,980 --> 07:59:26,600
Who did he kill?

7628
07:59:26,920 --> 07:59:32,120
Oh, it's because I met Typhon.

7629
07:59:35,120 --> 07:59:36,360
Get his attack?

7630
07:59:36,520 --> 07:59:36,820
Oh, God.

7631
07:59:36,880 --> 07:59:37,820
Please give me the attack.

7632
07:59:38,060 --> 07:59:39,460
I don't know what his attack is, but...

7633
07:59:39,480 --> 07:59:41,080
actually gets... Oh, never mind.

7634
07:59:41,240 --> 07:59:42,160
I don't have its attacks.

7635
07:59:45,860 --> 07:59:46,420
Um...

7636
07:59:47,320 --> 07:59:47,880
Um...

7637
07:59:47,880 --> 07:59:49,260
We want special then?

7638
07:59:54,980 --> 07:59:55,800

7640
07:59:59,900 --> 08:00:00,960
Oh, may spill.

7641
08:00:01,940 --> 08:00:02,780
Is there three good?

7642
08:00:08,200 --> 08:00:09,280
One or three?

7643
08:00:09,540 --> 08:00:09,900
So what is it?

7644
08:00:09,940 --> 08:00:10,620
Three is better?

Yeah, early chaos too.

7654
08:00:40,860 --> 08:00:41,420
Which is good.

7655
08:00:45,250 --> 08:00:48,690
I'm doing is that the fate's based upon you proved inspiring
to me.

don't as quickly as olympus can repel them have you found

7664
08:02:24,660 --> 08:02:32,060
any weaknesses in their ranks they cannot be permanently
slain are barely susceptible to my most noxious poisons and

7665
08:02:32,060 --> 08:02:37,120
are single-minded in their devotion to the titan lord any of
those sound like weaknesses

08:03:18,920 --> 08:03:21,180
One thousand mana endgame.

There's my target.

7684
08:04:03,400 --> 08:04:04,680
Alright, we gotta get this actually.

7685
08:04:07,120 --> 08:04:08,060
Wait, wake up.

7686
08:04:09,320 --> 08:04:10,840
God, what hit me?

7687

Alright, what summons do I get?

7692
08:04:34,200 --> 08:04:35,140
That foolish Titan.

7693
08:04:35,640 --> 08:04:39,580
He is awakened Typhon, the most terrible monstrosity that
ever lived.

7694
08:04:40,460 --> 08:04:43,680
They still bear my scars from when we first clashed very
long ago.

7695
08:04:44,520 --> 08:04:46,340
Together, we did vanquish him before.

7696
08:04:46,840 --> 08:04:48,200
We shall have to manage it again.

7697
08:04:49,160 --> 08:04:50,680
That should be easy, right?

7698
08:04:52,420 --> 08:04:53,760
Oh my god, health.

7699
08:04:55,120 --> 08:04:55,440

7706
08:05:11,690 --> 08:05:12,130
Whoops.

7708
08:05:15,370 --> 08:05:15,630

08:12:47,900 --> 08:12:48,660
It's okay.

7821
08:12:49,040 --> 08:12:49,680
We made it.

7822
08:12:50,360 --> 08:12:50,980
Got you.

7823
08:12:51,720 --> 08:12:54,500
I thought it was the summon, so I went and used it here.

7824
08:12:58,880 --> 08:13:00,500
Recycle, thank you for the gift of ship, thank you.

7825

Thank you!

7826
08:13:02,040 --> 08:13:03,380

That's why I'm making you thick!

7828

Nope.

Yes, well, sometimes we have no one to blame but ourselves.

7852
08:15:33,300 --> 08:15:35,200
Nobody's gonna pay for all that someday.

7853
08:15:35,820 --> 08:15:36,740
But who's nobody?

08:17:32,950 --> 08:17:33,510
I was worried.

7880
08:17:33,670 --> 08:17:35,590

It's fine.

7899
08:19:01,040 --> 08:19:01,980
I need the money anyway.

7900
08:19:02,160 --> 08:19:02,940
I'm poor.

7901
08:19:05,740 --> 08:19:06,640
It's just okay.

7902
08:19:07,080 --> 08:19:07,620
It's okay.

7903
08:19:08,020 --> 08:19:09,180
It's okay, guys.

7904
08:19:09,640 --> 08:19:10,600
We need the money.

7905
08:19:11,760 --> 08:19:13,740
We're not doing so well in the economy.

7906
08:19:14,380 --> 08:19:16,620
The economy's been very rough, guys.

7907
08:19:19,980 --> 08:19:22,000
I don't know if I have enough damage, though.

7908
08:19:23,120 --> 08:19:23,480
Oh, hey.

7909
08:19:23,680 --> 08:19:23,960
Nice.

7910
08:19:24,140 --> 08:19:25,060
We actually needed HP.

7911
08:19:31,120 --> 08:19:31,780
Whoops.

7912
08:19:34,360 --> 08:19:35,240
Where's the other guy?

7913
08:19:36,100 --> 08:19:36,720
Oh, there he is.

7914
08:19:39,080 --> 08:19:39,640
Oh, that's good.

7915
08:19:39,720 --> 08:19:40,320
We needed that.

7916
08:19:40,620 --> 08:19:40,880
Activated.

7917
08:19:45,060 --> 08:19:45,720
Uh...

7918
08:19:45,720 --> 08:19:48,160
Up we uh...

7919
08:19:48,820 --> 08:19:50,400
Alternate attack in special.

7920
08:19:50,780 --> 08:19:50,780
Alright.

7921
08:19:51,520 --> 08:19:51,900
Try.

7922
08:19:55,430 --> 08:19:56,430
Alright, wake up!

7923
08:19:56,470 --> 08:19:57,010
Oh shit!

7924
08:19:57,990 --> 08:19:58,670
Wake up!

7925
08:20:04,910 --> 08:20:05,570
Okay.

7926
08:20:07,150 --> 08:20:08,290
Oh, nice.

7927
08:20:09,550 --> 08:20:11,670
You want to make sure I'm not missing anything here?

7928
08:20:12,790 --> 08:20:13,630
Nice, another...

7929
08:20:14,630 --> 08:20:16,030
Another Ares, too.

7930
08:20:16,810 --> 08:20:17,390
Which is good.

7931
08:20:20,170 --> 08:20:21,470
Need another Ares.

7932
08:20:25,470 --> 08:20:25,970
Right now.

7933
08:20:26,430 --> 08:20:27,350
Oh, no, I ran out.

7934
08:20:30,700 --> 08:20:31,700
Oh, where are the orbs?

7935
08:20:31,780 --> 08:20:32,780
Where are the mana regen?

7936
08:20:33,420 --> 08:20:33,980
There you go.

7937
08:20:35,080 --> 08:20:35,320
Yeah!

7938
08:20:35,460 --> 08:20:35,760
I!

7939
08:20:36,200 --> 08:20:36,520
Yes!

7940
08:20:37,560 --> 08:20:39,280
I got too excited.

7941
08:20:44,790 --> 08:20:50,910
Cast crates over each flow in the binding circle I got too
excited.

7942
08:20:51,090 --> 08:20:51,710
I was like, yay!

7943
08:20:55,470 --> 08:20:55,990
Okay.

7944
08:20:55,990 --> 08:20:56,510
Three.

7945
08:20:57,170 --> 08:20:57,410
Okay.

7946
08:20:57,590 --> 08:20:58,450
For the captain's wheel.

7947
08:21:05,280 --> 08:21:05,860
Boy, Ash.

7948
08:21:08,500 --> 08:21:09,300
What the fuck?

7949
08:21:10,620 --> 08:21:11,740
I hit the big cast.

7950
08:21:12,220 --> 08:21:12,740
Come on!

7951
08:21:13,080 --> 08:21:14,420
Are you serious?

7952
08:21:15,800 --> 08:21:16,640
There it is.

7953
08:21:20,300 --> 08:21:22,600
Jesus Christ, that did so much damage on me.

7954
08:21:23,100 --> 08:21:23,720
Another Ares?

7955
08:21:24,500 --> 08:21:25,500
What am I going to do?

7956
08:21:25,700 --> 08:21:27,740
Oh, I'm like, oh, fuck.

7957
08:21:28,100 --> 08:21:28,660
Okay, that's fine.

7958
08:21:30,420 --> 08:21:33,040
What am I going to do with all this Ares?

7959
08:21:37,060 --> 08:21:38,900
Okay, this is not cool.

7960
08:21:39,620 --> 08:21:41,080
It's not cool.

7961
08:21:42,600 --> 08:21:43,660
Okay, we got it.

7962
08:21:43,740 --> 08:21:44,640
Oh, my God.

7963
08:21:44,900 --> 08:21:46,940
Are you fucking kidding me?

7964
08:21:49,480 --> 08:21:50,680
Oh, my God.

7965
08:21:50,800 --> 08:21:51,340
Bro, okay.

7966
08:21:57,340 --> 08:21:59,360
Holy shit, he's so hard.

7967
08:22:01,980 --> 08:22:02,900
Okay, there you go.

7968
08:22:05,120 --> 08:22:06,300
I'll take the helm from here.

7969
08:22:06,440 --> 08:22:07,700
I lost the Deft of Guides.

7970
08:22:11,580 --> 08:22:13,160
Okay, now I can gift.

7971
08:22:14,180 --> 08:22:19,220
Lord Ares, I know mortal warriors often would make offerings
to you before their battles to the death.

7972
08:22:19,860 --> 08:22:21,660
I likewise wish to pay you my respects.

7973
08:22:24,440 --> 08:22:32,220
Maybe if I gift him something, I can bribe him for some- a
good- I can bribe him for like a good upgrade.

7974
08:22:35,360 --> 08:22:36,380
Alright, nice.

7975
08:22:37,360 --> 08:22:40,440
Alright, let's see if bribery works.

7976
08:22:41,200 --> 08:22:42,820
Olympus, I accept this message.

7977
08:22:45,900 --> 08:22:46,540
I don't know.

7978
08:22:46,940 --> 08:22:48,620
I've never had Ares before.

7979
08:22:52,560 --> 08:22:54,560
I don't know.

7980
08:23:00,620 --> 08:23:00,620
Three?

7981
08:23:01,040 --> 08:23:01,540
All right.

7982
08:23:02,580 --> 08:23:03,420
Oh shit, nice.

7983
08:23:06,160 --> 08:23:07,800
Got the double at least.

7984
08:23:08,700 --> 08:23:10,780
Oh, and I get to talk to...

7985
08:23:10,780 --> 08:23:11,820
Uh...

7986
08:23:11,820 --> 08:23:12,740
Is that Cersei?

7987
08:23:13,560 --> 08:23:14,740
Yeah, Cersei.

7988
08:23:14,960 --> 08:23:16,260
Oh, I already gifted, though.

7989
08:23:16,380 --> 08:23:21,100
That ancient isle on which a great enchantress plies a
trade.

7990
08:23:21,780 --> 08:23:23,460
I like the that pig over there.

7991
08:23:24,220 --> 08:23:25,800
That pig's seen things.

7992
08:23:28,300 --> 08:23:30,140
This pig has seen things.

7993
08:23:30,240 --> 08:23:31,600
Oh he has a tattoo too!

7994
08:23:32,060 --> 08:23:34,600
So what is even happening there at the mountain of the gods?

7995
08:23:35,380 --> 08:23:41,080
Some nights, great plumes of flame appear on the horizon and
storm clouds, terrible as ever.

7996
08:23:41,420 --> 08:23:44,780
The source of these phenomena is a two-pronged assault on
Mount Olympus.

7997
08:23:45,280 --> 08:23:48,860
The Titan Prometheus and his raiders and the monster Typhon
himself.

7998
08:23:49,540 --> 08:23:50,660
I'm headed to face them.

7999
08:23:51,460 --> 08:23:53,600
Good heavens you mean face them all, Puppet.

8000
08:23:54,280 --> 08:23:56,500
Although perchance the perils you confront beneath them.

8001
08:23:56,520 --> 08:23:57,960
The earth are even worse.

8002
08:23:58,660 --> 08:24:01,320
Let me protect you then as best I can.

8003
08:24:01,660 --> 08:24:02,000
Alright.

8004
08:24:04,980 --> 08:24:06,840
And grow in size.

8005
08:24:07,320 --> 08:24:07,840
Not okay.

8006
08:24:15,720 --> 08:24:17,320
Do it.

8007
08:24:18,880 --> 08:24:19,680
Guys.

8008
08:24:20,540 --> 08:24:23,200
I don't know if I can survive.

8009
08:24:28,620 --> 08:24:29,420
Two?

8010
08:24:30,100 --> 08:24:30,320
Two.

8011
08:24:30,640 --> 08:24:30,740
Okay.

8012
08:24:30,760 --> 08:24:37,760
Okay, guys, will it lead me to, will it lead me to victory?

8013
08:24:42,770 --> 08:24:43,970
All right, here we go.

8014
08:24:45,970 --> 08:24:47,470
Here we go.

8015
08:24:47,770 --> 08:24:48,670
Oh, my God.

8016
08:24:49,290 --> 08:24:59,570
Oh, my, I swear to God, guys, if we die because we picked
you, I swear to God, we're a giant woman now.

8017
08:24:59,850 --> 08:25:01,090
More hitbox.

8018
08:25:01,290 --> 08:25:02,150
Let's go.

8019
08:25:03,090 --> 08:25:06,550
Oh my god, it's already looking very rough.

8020
08:25:10,430 --> 08:25:11,030
Okay.

8021
08:25:11,830 --> 08:25:13,030
Am I slower, too?

8022
08:25:13,170 --> 08:25:13,990
I can't tell.

8023
08:25:16,950 --> 08:25:18,570
New course needs to be set.

8024
08:25:20,850 --> 08:25:21,890
Ash, as always.

8025
08:25:28,900 --> 08:25:29,180
Jesus.

8026
08:25:29,440 --> 08:25:30,060
Alright, it's fine.

8027
08:25:35,540 --> 08:25:35,880
Okay.

8028
08:25:38,820 --> 08:25:41,120
A lot of shit going on right now.

8029
08:25:41,420 --> 08:25:42,200
On my screen.

8030
08:25:42,380 --> 08:25:45,980
Now for the last one.

8031
08:25:47,620 --> 08:25:49,120
Holy fuck, that was a lot on my screen.

8032
08:25:49,300 --> 08:25:50,580
I got very confused.

8033
08:25:53,680 --> 08:25:54,800
What the fuck?

8034
08:25:57,200 --> 08:25:57,580
Okay.

8035
08:25:58,920 --> 08:25:59,940
I am so confused.

8036
08:26:00,080 --> 08:26:01,040
There's a lot on my screen.

8037
08:26:04,080 --> 08:26:05,660
Alright, shop tab.

8038
08:26:08,260 --> 08:26:10,360
Oh, that one was stressful.

8039
08:26:12,020 --> 08:26:12,360
Yeah.

8040
08:26:12,380 --> 08:26:14,380
I can afford everything.

08:29:02,440 --> 08:29:03,900
Oh my god, that's close.

8074
08:29:09,230 --> 08:29:10,730
Oh, where is she going?

8075
08:29:16,140 --> 08:29:17,660
Are you fucking kidding me?

8076
08:29:22,760 --> 08:29:23,340
There you go.

8078
08:29:31,140 --> 08:29:31,640
Yes!

8079
08:29:32,200 --> 08:29:32,940
Oh, thank God.

8080
08:29:33,200 --> 08:29:33,280
Okay.

8081
08:29:33,920 --> 08:29:34,480
All right, we're good.

8082
08:29:34,920 --> 08:29:36,180
She didn't summon anything, too.

8083
08:29:36,820 --> 08:29:37,340
That's good.

8084
08:29:38,220 --> 08:29:39,060
She never learned.

8085
08:29:39,060 --> 08:29:40,740
Oh, she didn't summon anything.

8086
08:29:42,340 --> 08:29:43,500
That's good for me.

8087
08:29:44,920 --> 08:29:45,400
All right.

8088
08:29:45,720 --> 08:29:48,560
Off we go, Prometheus time.

8089
08:29:49,760 --> 08:29:51,740
Okay, we gotta get the Tooth now.

8090
08:29:55,020 --> 08:29:55,890
Prometheus time.

8091
08:29:57,820 --> 08:29:59,280
Water, Tooth.

8092
08:29:59,520 --> 08:29:59,820
Oh, yeah.

8093
08:30:02,380 --> 08:30:02,900
Tooth.

8094
08:30:03,440 --> 08:30:03,960
We need it.

8095
08:30:04,000 --> 08:30:04,640
We need HP.

8096
08:30:05,760 --> 08:30:06,480
We need HP.

8097
08:30:07,040 --> 08:30:07,680
What's the?

8098
08:30:07,820 --> 08:30:11,460
Which palm does so the magic gives me more HP?

8099
08:30:12,660 --> 08:30:13,560
Which one was it?

8100
08:30:17,160 --> 08:30:17,740
Okay.

8101
08:30:17,760 --> 08:30:19,760
Which god does that for me?

8102
08:30:23,760 --> 08:30:25,400
I'm here, bitch.

8103
08:30:28,740 --> 08:30:31,920
I do not like how much it's costing me.

8104
08:30:38,190 --> 08:30:39,770
Hef for Aphrodite, okay.

8105
08:30:40,950 --> 08:30:42,670
It's good to know.

8106
08:30:44,350 --> 08:30:47,330
Uh, we'll get palm.

8107
08:30:49,370 --> 08:30:51,810
All right, let's hope we bump into a hef then.

8108
08:30:52,450 --> 08:30:54,570
Oh my god, are you fucking...

8109
08:30:54,570 --> 08:30:56,270
Okay, okay, close enough.

8110
08:30:58,550 --> 08:30:58,910
Close enough.

8111
08:30:59,450 --> 08:31:00,490
We were almost there.

8112
08:31:02,290 --> 08:31:04,410
Yeah, oh my god, it's okay.

8113
08:31:04,550 --> 08:31:05,150
We have this.

8114
08:31:06,290 --> 08:31:06,810
There you go.

8115
08:31:10,490 --> 08:31:13,450
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no.

8116
08:31:14,850 --> 08:31:16,530
Oh god, oh my god.

8117
08:31:16,850 --> 08:31:17,610
She can't get me.

8118
08:31:17,870 --> 08:31:20,230
He can't get... Oh my god, he's stuck.

8119
08:31:22,790 --> 08:31:24,410
It was Where is it?

8120
08:31:24,750 --> 08:31:25,890
He was stuck.

8121
08:31:31,340 --> 08:31:32,020
Straightforward.

8122
08:31:32,500 --> 08:31:32,860
He is.

8123
08:31:33,300 --> 08:31:34,020
Thank God.

8124
08:31:34,560 --> 08:31:35,120
Touched him.

8125
08:31:42,080 --> 08:31:42,920
Stupid bird.

8126
08:31:44,760 --> 08:31:44,880
Yeah.

8127
08:31:45,600 --> 08:31:47,120
Stupid fucking bird.

8128
08:31:50,670 --> 08:31:51,350
Alright.

8129
08:32:00,220 --> 08:32:01,060
I need more mana.

8130
08:32:01,280 --> 08:32:01,460
Okay.

8131
08:32:02,240 --> 08:32:03,120
Follow your senses.

8132
08:32:03,880 --> 08:32:04,180
What?

8133
08:32:05,520 --> 08:32:06,480
Oh yeah.

8134
08:32:07,140 --> 08:32:07,600
Now.

8135
08:32:10,820 --> 08:32:12,400
Uh, hammer time.

8136
08:32:15,100 --> 08:32:16,660
Alright, this should get locked.

8137
08:32:17,200 --> 08:32:17,660
There you go.

8138
08:32:19,300 --> 08:32:19,760
Jesus Christ.

8139
08:32:20,560 --> 08:32:23,800
I do that, and then...

8140
08:32:26,060 --> 08:32:26,800
There you go.

8141
08:32:27,840 --> 08:32:29,420
Oh yeah, no, we're fucking...

8142
08:32:29,420 --> 08:32:30,920
We're gonna...

8143
08:32:30,920 --> 08:32:33,340
We're gonna lock this guy down fast.

8144
08:32:36,180 --> 08:32:37,420
Okay, we got...

8145
08:32:37,800 --> 08:32:39,000
Where's my cat?

8146
08:32:39,580 --> 08:32:41,480
I feel like I'm always, like, trying to find my cat.

8147
08:32:41,640 --> 08:32:42,160
Oh, there he is.

8148
08:32:43,060 --> 08:32:45,200
That's, like, where the fuck did he go?

8149
08:32:51,070 --> 08:32:51,330
Alright.

8150
08:32:55,260 --> 08:32:56,640
Attacks have more range.

8151
08:32:56,800 --> 08:32:57,460
Your channel.

8152
08:33:01,430 --> 08:33:01,550
Oh.

8153
08:33:02,070 --> 08:33:02,590
Wait.

8154
08:33:03,450 --> 08:33:04,270
Three, right?

8155
08:33:11,620 --> 08:33:12,100
Three.

8156
08:33:13,180 --> 08:33:14,860
Deskira grows in strength.

8157
08:33:16,660 --> 08:33:17,540
Anything I'm missing?

8158
08:33:17,640 --> 08:33:18,200
Oh, moon.

8159
08:33:18,580 --> 08:33:19,040
Fuck.

8160
08:33:19,540 --> 08:33:20,060
Okay.

8161
08:33:20,940 --> 08:33:21,500
What?

8162
08:33:21,960 --> 08:33:23,360
What was the talking one again?

8163
08:33:24,700 --> 08:33:28,540
Moon or moon upgrade or NPC?

8164
08:33:28,720 --> 08:33:29,920
I don't remember what the NPC was.

8165
08:33:30,100 --> 08:33:32,120
I met so many NPCs.

8166
08:33:32,600 --> 08:33:32,980
Oh, Dio.

8167
08:33:33,840 --> 08:33:35,380
Alright, moon or Dio, guys?

8168
08:33:44,800 --> 08:33:45,660
Dio is useful.

8169
08:33:45,780 --> 08:33:47,020
Okay, we'll grab Dio then.

8170
08:33:47,660 --> 08:33:48,660
We'll party.

8171
08:33:48,820 --> 08:33:49,940
It's time to party.

8172
08:33:50,120 --> 08:33:51,380
It's yester time.

8173
08:33:52,260 --> 08:33:52,940
Well, hey.

8174
08:33:57,700 --> 08:34:00,380
The gods apparently is concentrated.

8175
08:34:01,600 --> 08:34:03,160
I don't have another gift.

8176
08:34:03,360 --> 08:34:04,820
I don't have another nectar.

8177
08:34:07,920 --> 08:34:08,980
I would if I could.

8178
08:34:10,340 --> 08:34:11,880
Does anyone have any spare nectar?

8179
08:34:13,140 --> 08:34:13,580
Hey,

8180
08:34:17,100 --> 08:34:20,040
look who decided to reconsider coming to our little
gathering.

8181
08:34:20,600 --> 08:34:21,840

Unfortunately, I don't think I can.

8187
08:34:31,040 --> 08:34:32,520
There are various perils beyond.

8188
08:34:32,540 --> 08:34:35,800
And your fellow Olympians can only do so much to hold them
off.

8189

8193
08:34:52,160 --> 08:34:54,780
I can't believe the Greek gods invented disco

8194
08:34:59,140 --> 08:35:01,140

percentage magic shit or we get HP?

8205
08:35:29,780 --> 08:35:30,560
We play safe.

8206
08:35:36,220 --> 08:35:38,520
Do we take the Gambo or we play safe?

8207
08:35:39,760 --> 08:35:40,380
Gambo or safe?

8208
08:35:40,520 --> 08:35:41,980

8209
08:35:42,620 --> 08:35:43,100

8440
08:55:08,780 --> 08:55:09,400

08:55:10,620 --> 08:55:12,140
Wait a minute.

08:55:12,700 --> 08:55:13,540
Oh, wait.

8443
08:55:13,660 --> 08:55:15,700
I don't think I like these two.

8444
08:55:15,960 --> 08:55:17,680
Oh, where's my cat?

8445
08:55:20,280 --> 08:55:22,780
What the fuck is going on?

8446
08:55:24,700 --> 08:55:25,220
Okay.

8447
08:55:28,060 --> 08:55:29,580
I don't know what's going on.

8448
08:55:29,840 --> 08:55:31,200
I don't know what's going on.

8449
08:55:34,960 --> 08:55:35,480
Okay.

8450
08:55:39,990 --> 08:55:40,890
Oh, my God.

8451
08:55:41,010 --> 08:55:41,590
Oh, my God.

08:55:41,670 --> 08:55:42,230
I got healed again.

8453
08:55:44,190 --> 08:55:45,230
I think that's the last one.

8454
08:55:46,810 --> 08:55:47,110
Okay.

8455
08:55:47,330 --> 08:55:47,950
That's fine.

8456
08:55:50,830 --> 08:55:52,190
Okay, it's fine.

8457
08:55:53,670 --> 08:55:55,490
There we go.

8458
08:55:55,890 --> 08:55:55,930
Oh.

8459
08:55:57,550 --> 08:55:58,250
They're easy.

8460
08:55:58,490 --> 08:55:59,390
Yeah, this one was easy.

8461
08:56:00,910 --> 08:56:00,930
Okay.

8462
08:56:01,530 --> 08:56:01,910
Okay.

8463
08:56:03,670 --> 08:56:04,630
Here we go.

8464
08:56:04,910 --> 08:56:06,590
Here we go again.

8465
08:56:06,710 --> 08:56:07,030
I heal.

8466
08:56:07,370 --> 08:56:08,010
Because

8467
08:56:12,350 --> 08:56:16,590
we gotta stop gambling, guys.

8468
08:56:17,030 --> 08:56:17,570
We gotta...

8469
08:56:18,690 --> 08:56:19,570
Guys, we gotta...

8470
08:56:20,570 --> 08:56:22,970
Guys, guys, I don't think we...

8471
08:56:22,970 --> 08:56:24,270
Guys, I think...

8472
08:56:24,290 --> 08:56:27,810
I think we might have to stop gambling, guys.

8473
08:56:28,490 --> 08:56:31,590
I never stop ever.

8474
08:56:34,350 --> 08:56:36,050
I think the house is winning.

8475
08:56:36,630 --> 08:56:39,450
I think the house is winning, guys.

8476
08:56:40,610 --> 08:56:41,470
Just get three.

8477
08:56:41,570 --> 08:56:42,390
Do we get three?

8478
08:56:42,770 --> 08:56:43,770
One, two, or three?

8479
08:56:50,700 --> 08:56:51,040
Three?

8480
08:56:51,280 --> 08:56:51,600
All right.

8481
08:56:52,040 --> 08:56:53,520
I see more people.

8482
08:56:54,120 --> 08:56:54,720
Same three.

8483
08:56:58,160 --> 08:56:58,540
All right.

8484
08:56:58,680 --> 08:56:59,300
All right.

8485
08:57:00,480 --> 08:57:13,990
more people pick three oh my it's fine I have the goddamn
armor shit going on so I can take shit for now but I am so

8486
08:57:13,990 --> 08:57:23,910

lot of things going on on my screen right now and I'm

8487
08:57:23,910 --> 08:57:33,700
worried there you go all right up I go

8488
08:57:37,280 --> 08:57:46,480
I do think that maybe, maybe we gambled a little too much,
but that's just a little game theory.

8489
08:57:47,300 --> 08:57:48,360
I could be wrong.

8490
08:57:49,100 --> 08:57:51,060
Obviously, I could be wrong.

8491
08:57:51,940 --> 08:57:52,760
Coin for Karon.

8492
08:57:54,120 --> 08:57:55,920
Okay, Palmer Demeter.

8493
08:57:59,560 --> 08:58:01,780
There's never enough gamma.

8494
08:58:04,920 --> 08:58:06,760
Yeah, I want to get rid of that.

8495
08:58:12,710 --> 08:58:14,610
I see more palms.

8496
08:58:17,050 --> 08:58:18,150
What is this?

8497
08:58:18,390 --> 08:58:19,590
What the fuck is that?

8498
08:58:24,600 --> 08:58:26,420
What the fuck am I?

8499
08:58:27,040 --> 08:58:28,100
What the fuck?

8500
08:58:30,620 --> 08:58:31,180
Okay.

8501
08:58:31,920 --> 08:58:33,300
It's very slow, though.

8502
08:58:33,740 --> 08:58:35,500
Oh, it's not even over.

8503
08:58:35,980 --> 08:58:36,460
Oh, okay.

8504
08:58:36,540 --> 08:58:37,080
Never mind.

8505
08:58:37,180 --> 08:58:38,480
I was like, we did it, guys.

8506
08:58:38,660 --> 08:58:40,400
And then it's not even over.

8507
08:58:40,680 --> 08:58:42,340
I was like, oh my god, guys.

8508
08:58:42,380 --> 08:58:43,620
That was so fast.

8509
08:58:43,880 --> 08:58:44,620
Yeah, man, let's go.

8510
08:58:47,040 --> 08:58:48,980
All right, he's coming back.

8511
08:58:54,000 --> 08:58:57,380
Okay, that is a lot of shit I have to fucking be aware of.

8512
08:59:10,340 --> 08:59:11,460
All right.

8513
08:59:11,780 --> 08:59:12,820
It's no use.

8514
08:59:14,140 --> 08:59:15,720
I have to do this.

8515
08:59:16,440 --> 08:59:17,760
Jesus fucking Christ.

8516
08:59:18,040 --> 08:59:20,220
Okay, this is taking a long time.

8517
08:59:25,860 --> 08:59:27,540
Are you fucking kidding me?

8518
08:59:27,680 --> 08:59:29,160
Okay, that's not good.

Okay, there we go.

8523
09:00:06,720 --> 09:00:07,800
Oh, is this body up?

8524
09:00:08,000 --> 09:00:09,620
Oh my god, I didn't realize.

8525
09:00:10,020 --> 09:00:12,840
I didn't realize the body was up during that.

8526
09:00:13,040 --> 09:00:14,540
I thought I had to kill the eye.

8527
09:00:15,480 --> 09:00:16,760
Oh, I'm so stupid.

8528
09:00:16,940 --> 09:00:18,000
I didn't see that.

8529
09:00:20,000 --> 09:00:21,940
I thought the eye was the boss.

8530
09:00:23,540 --> 09:00:23,880
Yeah.

8531
09:00:25,540 --> 09:00:27,520

Some assistance, please.

8539
09:01:25,400 --> 09:01:26,580

Okay.

8542
09:01:30,980 --> 09:01:31,960
We actually need that.

8543
09:01:32,360 --> 09:01:33,180
I feel like I failed you here.

8544
09:01:33,460 --> 09:01:36,060
I was supposed to figure out what Gramps was up to, but I
wasn't quick enough.

8545
09:01:36,280 --> 09:01:37,960
So now you're fighting Typhon face to face.

8546
09:01:39,480 --> 09:01:41,380
This won't be a 10-hour stream.

8547
09:01:41,560 --> 09:01:43,280
Almost 10 hours later.

8548
09:01:43,560 --> 09:01:52,880
I mean, thank you for the Magenta but they look look i have
perfectly good excuse okay they're so close we're actually

8549
09:01:52,880 --> 09:02:00,860
so close to beating the game than the past i know you're
right it's just i'm starting to accept that all of this is

8550
09:02:00,860 --> 09:02:06,340
what gramps wanted to achieve first capture the three fates
so they can't mess with him then wake up typhon so he can

8551
09:02:06,340 --> 09:02:13,320
mess with us then take you didn't know all the details but
long since figured out kronos was up to something big had

8552
09:02:13,320 --> 09:02:20,920
you not acted swiftly then i wouldn't be here now wait we're
not doing a hundred percent guys i just want an ending i for

8553
09:02:20,920 --> 09:02:30,840

we can with what we've got all right we'll grab armor short

both demeanor and then air eris or the meter the meter i'll

8555

8556
09:02:46,540 --> 09:02:47,440
How much we got?

8557
09:02:47,640 --> 09:02:48,780
We got a lot of money.

8558
09:02:52,740 --> 09:02:57,540
Okay, but Heph's like in a wheelchair, bro.

09:03:03,620 --> 09:03:04,360
Oh, shit.

8562
09:03:04,880 --> 09:03:05,080

09:03:15,560 --> 09:03:21,920

Alright.

8575
09:04:19,940 --> 09:04:23,240
This is gonna be much more risky of a cast because I have to
run at him.

8576
09:04:24,500 --> 09:04:27,040
It's gonna be a lot riskier than before.

8577
09:04:34,370 --> 09:04:34,930
Because

8578
09:04:43,500 --> 09:04:44,060
like...

8579
09:04:44,060 --> 09:04:44,880
It's like it.

8580
09:04:45,400 --> 09:04:46,980
It's my temporary hits.

8581
09:04:48,100 --> 09:04:50,420
Oh my god, this is not...

8582
09:04:51,720 --> 09:04:54,200

Okay.

8584
09:05:10,110 --> 09:05:11,250

8585
09:05:11,770 --> 09:05:12,790

8586
09:05:13,990 --> 09:05:15,670
I need to grab my cat.

8587
09:05:16,350 --> 09:05:20,840
Oh my god.

8588
09:05:22,940 --> 09:05:23,640
Okay.

8589
09:05:31,080 --> 09:05:32,320
This is not good for me.

8590
09:05:36,120 --> 09:05:38,100
This is not good for me, guys.

8591
09:05:42,370 --> 09:05:43,490

I got hit by the three legs because I couldn't figure out...

8615
09:08:20,980 --> 09:08:23,500
I couldn't see the pattern for that.

8616
09:08:23,520 --> 09:08:25,680
So, how's it going on Olympus recently?

There was so much to keep track of.

8619
09:08:32,260 --> 09:08:34,940
Every time the tongue came up, I was not looking for it.

8620
09:08:35,520 --> 09:08:37,100
I was not aware of the tongue.

8621
09:08:37,560 --> 09:08:38,340
