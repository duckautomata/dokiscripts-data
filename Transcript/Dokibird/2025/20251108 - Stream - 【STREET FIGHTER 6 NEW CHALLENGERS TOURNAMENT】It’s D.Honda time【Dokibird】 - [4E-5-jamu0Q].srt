00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,100
We were waiting for them to finish yapping.

00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,180

53
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,060
Oh, that link doesn't work.

ah sorry sorry everyone I haven't been this nervous in a long time.

60
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:08,620
I think it's because, like, I didn't expect myself to climb this high on Honda.

61
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:14,140
So, like, I'm like, bro, okay, one of my mods was, like, scouting for me.

62
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:19,780
And apparently one of the players was labbing against me for two to three hours today.

63
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:24,000
Like, she was labbing against Honda for two to three hours.

64
00:10:27,100 --> 00:11:21,680
what I'm not even the best I'm not even the best player in the bracket if anything the Aki's the best player in the bracket on this is like why are you laughing yeah or like anti-shimmy as well which is like if they shimmy you just like move back but like that's the oh my god and okay okay apparently I was talking about a different person but like I have to keep worrying about about my jp but like oh my god why is everyone laughing against me i'm just playing rake i also love this i don't think i've only had one hour to laugh against my opponents because i just wanted to play i was playing rake i was like i feel like i was just gonna get bad habits because i don't know like exactly the end the way your play styles are i don't even know oh are we starting

Okay.

77
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,420

78
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,960

Oh, she's not, she's not.

82
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,220
No, she's, She's fine.

83
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,040
She's fine.

84
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:56,780

85
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,180
Oh, I believe.

86
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,940
I've always believed in my team.

87
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,960
Oh my god, look at her go.

88
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,540

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:09,900
Whoa.

90
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,000

91
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,060
Oh, yes!

92
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,580
Yeah!

93
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,640
I've always believed.

94
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,320
You can probably try weaponry some more.

95
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,260
Okay, I'm sorry.

96
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:32,060
I don't know why I got my own head today because like I don't know.

97
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:38,620
I think it's because I I got too high of a rank I messed up.

98
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,300
I why did I why did I climb the plat

99
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,360

102
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,790
The moment I fight Diamond Players, it was over for me.

103
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:05,950
That's why I'll never get to dive.

104
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,710
That's why I'll never climb up.

105
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:18,850
The thing that's bad is because I because like I Oh no Oh no Oh yeah!

Oh, that's so scary.

112
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,620
Because one, one grapple and it's like over.

00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:07,390
Oh no.

146
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:24,700
I am like, um, it's very admiring that this person, uh, Shumi, Shumi, Shuh, Shuh?

147
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,020
Shuh minions?

148
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,020
Decide to learn JP.

149
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:34,760
Because of, you know, I looked at him for five seconds and I was like, no JP.

150
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:37,900
Oh, yeah.

151
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,460
I think you can throw her more.

152
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,380
Oh, okay.

153
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,300
That was good.

154
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,540
Nice round, Emily.

155
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,220
You got this.

156
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,320
Good round, good round.

157
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:48,640
Yeah.

158
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,680
I'm trying not to get my nerves.

159
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,980
I wish I didn't know I was 20.

160
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:09,470
No.

161
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,910
That looks so annoying to play against.

162
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:25,350
I feel like in, um, I feel, I feel like when you're up close to him, you can't really do much.

163
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:29,190
Because like, majority of his stuff is on range.

164
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:30,070
Let's go!

165
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:31,610
You're cooking!

166
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:36,090
Yeah, the moment like, you run up to the old man, you You can just beat him up.

167
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:36,650
I see the pressure.

168
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,150
Just beat up the old man.

169
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:48,820
Huh?

170
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:08,010
I'm actually so nervous, guys.

171
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:10,750
I think after the first game, I should be fine.

172
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:15,470
Because after the first game, I got like, you know, I got the initial game.

173
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:23,970
It's just the first, it's always the first game, you know, like, because they get the initial Oh, like, what's it called?

174
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,330
The jitter bugs gone.

175
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,450
Um, yeah.

176
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:31,970
Whoops.

177
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:33,510
Yeah, the nerves gone.

178
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:34,910
Oh.

179
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:35,970
No.

180
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:38,950
Whoa!

181
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,530
Oh my god, that was so cool!

182
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:45,390
You go for more button dry rushes when you're close.

183
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:47,170
Yeah, the tournament jitters.

184
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:51,270
I'm just gonna abuse my moves until it stops working.

185
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:52,950
Because, I don't know.

186
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:55,050
Because all characters counter me in this tournament.

187
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:57,850
Oh, my God.

188
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:58,090
Okay.

189
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:58,710
Okay.

190
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:09,790
Okay.

191
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:10,850
Oh.

192
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,060
Oh.

193
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:15,480
Oh, my God.

194
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,400
My team are, like, gamers.

195
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,300
And then there's me.

196
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:19,980
I'm baby.

197
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,400
I'm baby.

198
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,280
Don't look at my rank.

199
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,740
My rank doesn't indicate anything.

200
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,880
I'm still baby.

201
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:39,700
Oh.

202
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,000
Oh, my God.

203
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:42,280
That looks...

204
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,560
That looks so annoying.

205
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,200
Oh!

206
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,040
You saw a longer meter.

207
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,480
Wow!

208
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,840
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

209
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,200
He's so annoying to play against.

210
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,240
What?

211
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,460
What the heck was that move?

212
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,750
Oh no, she's burned out.

213
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,130
That's not good.

214
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:21,350
You see, when I'm on Honda, when I'm burned out, mine's a bait.

215
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:25,530
I don't know if this can be good Bro,

216
00:21:36,980 --> 00:22:00,220
this is so annoying I don't ever want to get out of plat I don't want to ever leave All good, all good You just have to throw him instead of going for your Out of light Oh my

217
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:27,440
god Observe, I'm observing old man oh nice that was a good drive i hate how people adapt in this game we should have a one and done tournament no adapting is just pure skill

218
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,800
adapting is not a skill

219
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:48,960
no i feel like she just keeps walking like what am i You can just walk forward and do your crouch medium.

220
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:49,700
Okay.

221
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,460
One try, no adapting.

222
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,000
Adapt on the fly.

223
00:22:55,540 --> 00:23:00,060
Why do you need to have two games you adapt on the fly as you move?

224
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:07,220
If you need to think about how to counter your opponent afterwards, you've lost.

225
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:13,830
That's okay.

226
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,030
Do you like it?

227
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:21,210
cowards.

228
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,050
Jesus Christ.

229
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:31,350
You adapt while you, like I said, you adapt while you play.

230
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:35,270
Oh, Jesus.

231
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:41,650
God damn old man with his sticks.

232
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:42,550
Yeah!

233
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:43,270
Okay.

234
00:23:59,070 --> 00:23:59,870
Oh.

235
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:01,130
Oh.

236
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:01,170
Oh.

237
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:01,210
Okay.

238
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:01,850
Oh.

239
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,360
That's bad.

240
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,960
I always get to use up all your meter just to block JP.

241
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,620
Yes, no, yes, no.

242
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,060
Okay, yeah, that's annoying.

243
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,400
Yes, no, yes, no.

244
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:24,680
Nice.

245
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,640
Oh, that was a good counter.

246
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,160
Oh my god, that was too close.

247
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:42,180
Oh my god, Emily, you were amazing.

248

it's just first game jitters after the first game i'll be fine

253
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,940
there's no way she'll know my first move

254
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,860
yeah she's like pre-adapting what a cow

255

I use a leverless.

259
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:48,890
It was working this morning.

260
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,810
I was practicing with it.

261
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:51,330
Don't come.

262
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:54,390
OK, I'm going to restart.

263
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:56,750
I don't know what.

264
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:59,010
I got in the lobby, and then there was the game.

265
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:01,370
The controller was like, guess I won't play?

266

All right, I'm restarting.

268
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:11,690
I was wondering why I couldn't skip my cutscene.

269
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:12,870
I was just like, what?

Huh?

273
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,440
What?

274
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,300
I don't understand.

275
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,120
Um.

276
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:23,360
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, it's working.

It's working.

278
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,240
All right, let's go.

279
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:27,840
Okay.

280
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,800
Okay, it's working now.

281
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,260
You see that invite still?

282
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,380
Yeah, I got the invite.

283
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,700
I'm just getting in.

284
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,840
so I got really scared.

285
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:42,810
Oh.

286
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:46,830
Okay, it's working now.

287
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:48,030
That was weird.

288
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:49,790
That was very scary.

289
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,180
Okay.

290
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,420
I got it.

291
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:22,670
Okay, yeah, it's working.

292
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:23,390
Let's go, Donkey.

293
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:24,130
You got this.

294
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:25,330
You got this.

295
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:26,090
Cooker.

296
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:27,790
They want to know my first move.

297
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:31,770
Oh, okay.

298
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:32,190
Okay.

299
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:34,630
All right.

300
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:35,410
Um.

301
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,410
Oh my god.

302
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:44,230
That's fine.

303
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,860
Let's keep doing that.

304
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:05,310
Nice.

305
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,110
Okay.

306
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:10,910
Okay.

307
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:11,190
Okay.

308
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:12,090
Okay.

309
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:13,630
I messed up my input.

310
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:17,390
My heart is beating very fast.

311
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:18,750
No worries.

312
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:22,030
Oh, that was a good try though.

313
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:27,710
Oh.

314
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:29,570
Fine.

315
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:31,430
You can try a DI her too just doing that.

316
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:32,370
Or I do this.

317
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,770
Oh, you can just do that too.

318
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:36,030
Oh.

319
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:41,480
Nice.

320
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,040
Okay.

321
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,060
Oh, my hands are shaking.

322
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,220
Let's go.

323
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:49,160
My hands are shaking.

324
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:55,550
Oh.

325
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:56,670
Oh.

326
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,050
What the fuck?

327
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:25,690
They'll never expect my next move!

328
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:26,810
Let's go!

329
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:29,890
What would I

330
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:37,770
do next?

331
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:39,950
What would I do next?

332
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:40,290
Oh wait.

333
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:42,610
Who would have thought she knew?

334
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,040
Oh.

335
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,320
What would I do next?

336
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,420
Oh, okay, never mind.

337
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,100
Oh.

338
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,180
Oh no.

339
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,940
Oh, that's fine.

340
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,940
Yeah, I didn't think she'd use that.

341
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:04,060
I think your medium auto combo would go here if you wanted to just try and do that one.

342
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:07,720
Oh, I could do that.

343
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,700
There's like one more hit there.

344
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,180
Yeah, 20 points!

345
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:11,720
Oh, my God.

346
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,420
You're my goat.

347
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,560
One more game.

348
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,320
One more game.

349
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,240
One more?

350
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:22,340
Oh, okay.

351
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,400
Okay.

352
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:23,900
One more.

353
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,600
Okay, I spoke too soon.

354
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,700
I spoke too soon.

355
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:28,720
Wait, she left.

356
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:34,140
I think maybe they thought it was over, but they have only one more.

357
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:39,200
So my chat was like, I'm low-key getting mad watching this.

358
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,660
If it works, it works, guys.

359
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,440
That's how I got to plat.

360
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,100
I fully agree.

361
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,300
I'm not here for honor.

362
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:48,840
It doesn't even matter, man.

363
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,700
It's not what I'm saying.

364
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,120
Honor, it's about winning.

365
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,480
Well said.

366
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,360
japan awaits

367
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,740
here's a reason why i picked honda for this elo

368
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:15,540
oh my god please don't tell brian don't tell him don't tell her i only know the left side

369
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:57,220
when we're in the when we're in the in the home the home team we're always player one so thank god okay okay wait and then when we're on the away team we're always player two yeah oh no oh no guys i did not practice the other side a good thing good thing headbutt still works on the right side thank you guys they'll never know what i'm gonna use yeah that's right oh shumimi's in canada did that change something oh was it laggy yeah

370
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:08,460
I was like, like, I feel like when I quickly want my super to come out, like, it doesn't work if there's a little laggy, or maybe I'm just bad.

371
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,680
And I've, it's Eastside Canada, it's like, there you go.

372
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,180
Nice.

373
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,440
What would I use?

374
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,100
Oh.

375
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,680
Oh no, I, I jumped.

376
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:23,920
That's fine.

377
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,220
It doesn't really do that with damage.

378
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,710
Oh, oh, it's fine

379
00:35:44,760 --> 00:36:01,620
Oh, what the fuck Okay, there, yay Yeah, 20 points Oh, 20 points Oh, my god That is true, you were cooking on the right side I did it, she put me on the right side And I still made it out

380
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:35,700
Okay, we got 40 points then Hold on Alright, we're chilling Whatever happens, it doesn't matter anymore 50 points we're about to oh that's true that's true 50 is a nice number they will definitely 50 i believe in you dad yeah we can do it try to screw us over by practicing i have no nephew actually sent me with the os because if i lose i know exactly who to blame someone i'm not gonna say who but someone warmed up my opponent yeah she learned some new combos that would have been my

381
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:43,300
I think my heart was beating too fast that game.

382
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,120
I feel that.

383
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,540
The hardest iron match of my life.

384
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:55,160
I feel like everything you know when you go into a match like that was like some states in it and stuff.

385
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:55,940
Like, yeah.

386
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:02,300
The first like 30 seconds of that, I dropped my headbutt and that was the only move I know.

387
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,300
I was like, how do I mess up the only move I know?

388
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,080
You're the nerves, man.

389
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:09,560
Yeah.

390
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,260
No, guys, my heart was beating so fast.

391
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:15,920
Like, it still is.

392
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,180
It's still beating so fast right now.

393
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:21,340
I think when my controller just connected to us, just like, oh, no.

394
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,520
Kill her.

395
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,460
Oh.

396
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,280
Oh, my God.

397
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,340
It's flowchart time.

398
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,280
It's flowchart.

399
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,180
Oh, nice.

400
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:47,520
Whoa.

401
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,100
Learn that flowchart.

402
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:54,860
I told you, they never expect the first move.

403
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:00,680
The first move is always like, what would she do next?

404
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,920
What would she keep doing next?

405
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:08,890
Okay, okay.

406
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:11,470
She's talking a lot now, so you guys should me.

407
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:12,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

408
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:15,670
So unexpected, I know.

409
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:17,870
They'll never expect it.

410
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:24,150
I like how Nephi was like, Or maybe I'll do this.

411
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:29,670
Surely she won't keep spamming headbutt, right guys?

412
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:39,410
Yeah, this is more, this is definitely, I was not playing Street Fighter.

413
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,650
I was playing my own game.

414
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:58,700
You have

415
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,340
to change it.

416
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:07,440
I do have to because this is just the group stage.

417
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:08,700
It's not even playoffs.

418
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,500
That's the scary part.

419
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,620
Like, what if they start adapting?

420
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,280
Oh, no, guys.

421
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:16,880
Okay.

422
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,040
What if they start adapting?

423
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,780
Please sweep.

424
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,860
Yeah, follow that flow chart.

425
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,380
Your lift punishes are insane right now, bro.

426
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,240
Okay.

427
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,820
Your lift punishes are crazy.

428
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:27,580
Yeah.

429
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Pull up that flow chart on your other monitor if you need to.

430
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,940
Oh, my gosh.

431
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,180
Whoa.

432
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:45,470
What I noticed though is that what's her name?

433
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:48,490
She burns up so fast.

434
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:51,010
So all I have to do is she uses her burn.

435
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,950
You guys think I use burn up fast?

436
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:56,810
She uses her burn up faster than me.

437
00:39:57,010 --> 00:39:58,730
So all I had to do was just spam it.

438
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:01,090
Like.

439
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,520
Oh yeah, she blocked it.

440
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:30,220
Oh Yeah, this combo burns you out so fast That's why I was like think I I thought I was I thought I was like I'm trying freaked up freaked up because of my brain up

441
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:40,440
I'm trying this I'm trying guys I'm trying so hard to make sure I don't curse I

442
00:40:49,480 --> 00:41:18,800
because I don't even know which team is like the scariest team it must be so tilting to watch how I was playing in the main broadcast I wonder like people don't know who I am and they're like what the heck is she doing yeah that medium store you can always punish if it's like too close no I am my arm match is the first one He showed.

443
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,600
I was, yeah, I was the perfect Honda.

444
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,580
I was rage beating.

445
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:41,520
Head button DI, this is Street Fighter 6.

446
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:48,260
I told you, no one ever expects the first move.

447
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:55,890
Oh shit, sorry.

448
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:56,910
That's fine.

449
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:58,590
Oh, I had her.

450
00:41:59,490 --> 00:41:59,810
That's all good.

451
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:03,490
Oh man, nice.

452
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:04,930

00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:24,950
I'm joking.

488
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:25,470
I'm not going to plug.

489
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:26,510
I feel like they're not going to pick me.

490
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:36,110
For legal reason, that was a joke.

491
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:42,270
I mean, I don't know who they would pick, honestly, because I feel like they're all...

492
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:42,710
There's no way.

493
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:45,090
Yeah, they can't block the second one because that's the only move I know.

494
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:47,110
Still do they know.

495
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:50,990
Oh.

496
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:53,390
Ha ha ha.

497
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:57,590
Who's the two seed on my opponents?

498
00:45:57,970 --> 00:46:00,210
Oh, you're you're playing Curious Joy, the my player.

499
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:00,510
Okay.

500
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:01,210
The my player.

501
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:02,830
Oh, she's really good.

502
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:04,670
Oh, no.

503
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:05,270
Please, please.

504
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:08,010
I think she's the seed of our our thing.

505
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:11,350
Oh, no, I messed up.

506
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:12,590
I mean, I think you guys are all.

507
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:14,090
I'm the same, to be honest.

508
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:16,210
Ah, shucks.

509
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:17,110
Thanks, coach.

510
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:18,490
Oh, my God.

511
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:19,810
He jumped out.

512
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:21,910
That was exactly what to say to motivate me.

513
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:28,710
Oh, how did he know?

514
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:30,850
Oh, I'm on the right side.

515
00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:33,390
Oh, my God.

516
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:34,350
You are on the right side.

517
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:34,830
That's right.

518
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:37,450
Oh, God.

519
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:38,310
That's not right.

520
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:40,330
Guys, he adapted.

521
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:43,270
I wasn't, guys, I was not aware of him adapting.

522
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:49,250
Stupid fighting game players adapting to my every move

523
00:46:54,870 --> 00:47:00,690
This is why I won and done people I don't give them a chance to adapt

524
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:17,690
Okay How they're cheating Yeah guys search up my name I don't want to lose my plan It's not De-Honda.

525
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:20,890
Adapting is the name.

526
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:22,430
You should adapt on the fly.

527
00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:24,390
I'm afraid you did adapt on the fly.

528
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:25,490
But that doesn't count.

529
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:35,130
Alright.

530
00:47:35,370 --> 00:47:36,310
Not De-Honda.

531
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:40,870
It doesn't count.

532
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:42,550
Because he was playing Luke.

533
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:46,190

00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:49,300
I thought you didn't have level three because I was looking at mine.

541
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:51,380
Oh, oh my god.

542
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:53,560
That's right.

543
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:56,220
That's right.

544
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:58,620

That's right.

547
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,060
You never expect this, right?

548
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:09,760
Oh.

549
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:13,940
Oh, this is not.

550
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:14,260
Whoa.

551
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,220
There we go.

552
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:16,980
Wait, wait!

553
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:17,220

How- how did he know?

556
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:21,820
How- how did you know?

557
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:25,540

Get in the corner, nerd!

569
00:51:09,010 --> 00:51:10,110
Yes, yes!

00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:12,290
Watch my cutscene, too.

571
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:17,190
That's right.

572
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:19,750
You can watch my cutscene.

573
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:26,290
I took it is the only move.

574
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:29,670
Oh.

575
00:51:34,990 --> 00:51:35,130

Oh.

581
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:45,130
Not to punish.

582
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:46,270
How did he know?

583
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:50,840
Oh.

584
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:51,720

That's right!

588
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,440
What move would I use next?

589
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:09,030
Get out.

590
00:52:09,350 --> 00:52:11,150
Fight back, Alan.

591
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:19,510
Please fight back.

592
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:23,150
Oh my god, he's fighting back.

593
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:24,810
Guys, he's fighting back.

594
00:52:27,890 --> 00:52:29,870
Yo, why did you inspire him?

595
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:32,230
Oh, you know what that means.

596
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:33,630

He's fighting back.

600
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:41,960
Why did you inspire him to fight back?

601
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:48,060
That's right.

602
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:48,640
Get the finish.

603
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:49,480
That's right.

604
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:51,200
I'm not letting you win this.

605
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:53,220
He adapted.

606
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:55,720
Get out of your adaptation circle.

607
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,220
Get out of here.

608
00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:06,070
Whoa.

609
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:06,870
Whoa.

610
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:08,450
Whoa.

00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:08,510
Oh.

Out there you are.

613
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:17,530
Adapt!

614
00:53:18,350 --> 00:53:19,830
I don't like it.

615
00:53:20,210 --> 00:53:20,470
Stop.

616
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:23,850
Stop!

620
00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:35,870
I hate that he's adapting.

621
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:37,570
I don't like this.

622
00:53:40,110 --> 00:53:41,490
He fought back.

623
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:44,090
Why did you inspire him, dragons?

624
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:45,430

Well...

672
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:58,810
Yeah, probably like five or ten more minutes.

673
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:01,090
Okay, I can put one more match in.

674
00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:02,170
Yeah, I think so.

675
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:05,670
I saw a master...

676
00:57:05,670 --> 00:57:06,650
We're not fighting.

677
00:57:07,570 --> 00:57:09,430
Did a master ruin my lobby?

678
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:10,130
I'm sorry.

679
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:14,770
I want to learn how to play.

680
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:15,970
I...

681
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:20,670
What?

682
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:22,690
I'm not gonna be learning.

683
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:27,570
How is that good practice, guys?

684
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:34,890
I feel like, if anything...

685
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:39,250
Wait, what?

686
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:39,750
Okay.

687
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:40,930
Ping!

688
00:57:43,650 --> 00:57:46,270
I was like, why did my punish not work?

689
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:48,170
Oh, my God.

690
00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:49,870
Guys, this is bad.

691
00:57:49,890 --> 00:57:50,670
This is bad.

692
00:57:52,550 --> 00:57:53,290
This is bad.

693
00:57:53,490 --> 00:57:53,770
This is bad.

694
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:54,230
This is bad.

695
00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:54,690
This is bad.

696
00:57:54,910 --> 00:57:55,170
This is bad.

697
00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:56,710
This is very bad.

698
00:57:58,610 --> 00:58:00,470
There you go.

699
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:09,120
My turn!

700
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:11,840
My turn!

701
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:12,660
My turn!

702
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:14,480
My turn!

703
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:15,500
My turn!

704
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:16,420
My turn!

705
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:17,280
My turn!

706
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:19,560
My turn!

707
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:19,880
My turn!

708
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:27,240
All right guys, I may have set up the bot to do a corner loot.

709
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:30,480
And I think I lost at the bot 15 times in a row.

710
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:32,280
So, uh...

711
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:36,040
Thank you ahead of time for carrying the next series.

712
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:38,940
Well, she can't be as good as a bot.

713
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:41,740
Oh, that's right.

714
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:43,780
Yeah, I set up the corner throw.

715
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:44,520
Oh, guess what?

716
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:45,560
Guess what we're gonna do next?

717
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:47,660
Guess what we're gonna do next?

718
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:50,660
In the corner!

719
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:55,360
That's it!

720
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:56,200
Yeah!

721
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:05,540
The trick about turkey's turn is it never ends.

722
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:08,560
Turn up, burn out.

723
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:18,480
Oh, my god.

724
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:19,820
What do you mean, Shirouki?

725
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:23,600
Oh, no.

726
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,440
Oh, this is bad.

727
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:31,960
This is bad.

728
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:32,900

01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:22,040
I hate people who adapt to me.

733
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,520
This is not fair.

734
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,580
I miss when...

735
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:34,760

01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:28,700
Oh, I should have blocked.

742
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:29,500
That should have been blocked.

743
01:01:34,550 --> 01:01:35,550
Oh, yeah, that's right.

744
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:39,710
That one.

745
01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:42,310
Okay, that should have been.

746
01:01:44,350 --> 01:01:44,710
Oh.

757
01:04:45,730 --> 01:05:23,670
so so i did my job i beat my yeah yeah i i got my one win so if anything else happens today i just got i got my one win that's all that matters yeah it's a big win too it's just group staging but that's fine with me i'm just happy to get the one win chat yeah yeah i actually have to figure out how how i deal with that on the night not be meta in the high elo but god damn he is definitely a knowledge check it is it's surprising it's surprising how people in plat don't even know how to deal with it

758
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:37,920
i'm yeah i'm eating some chocolate right now i'm stressed out of course i'm stressed out guys i'm

759
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:44,840
Can you blame me, chat?

760
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:49,000
Can you really...

761
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:53,340
Can you really blame me?

762
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:56,460
I think Street Fighter.

763
01:05:57,700 --> 01:05:58,480
I think if I...

764
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:01,880
The thing is, I know some people were like, Oh, you were, like, so chill during Tekken.

765
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:05,260
The thing about Tekken is that I know I'm bad at...

766
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:08,500
Because, like, the people in my group stage...

767
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:11,400
The people in my...

768
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:46,000
beginner stage during that time for um techin they were all like really really really good for beginners so like everyone no one really had x like like sk was in my tier back then like now now she's in the master tier like i'm still in the beginner tier i'm i think yeah like i'm So the beginner tier and SK was in my tier

769
01:06:49,320 --> 01:07:41,480
And it was my first fighting game too, guys It was my first fighting game too And I think like, I think two I think like two to three of the players Yeah, two I think all the players in my tier went on to become like High Elo FGC players too So like in Tekken I knew in Tekken like like I was like the underdog like no one had any expectations on me um yeah I beat SK during the finals like no one expected I think the I remember people were doing the predictions and I would say like it was it was like payday it was like hitting the jackpot for those who predicted me like no no but like barely anyone expected me to win the game in the finals like

770
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,120
yeah the believers won big

771
01:07:52,420 --> 01:09:04,940
um so so like in Tekken I've had none of the anxiety and nervousness because I lost every game too during like I think I lost I've only won one matchup um during the Tekken slam um during the group stages and I won one playoffs during the only won one of my play like playoffs don't one that matters the most though by the way because it was the finals but so um so like I went there being like whatever no one had everyone like um has like zero expectations to me so I wasn't nervous because I was like I'm just trying I'm just trying my best and then street fighter I had that same mindset until I accidentally sweeped everyone during the group stages I was not expecting that i was not expecting i was honestly just messing around as well on zanke and that you know and then i put a giant like whoops oopsie a giant target on my back yeah and then and then then i got like super scared and anxious after that like

772
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:14,100
insanely hard against me and i i yeah

773
01:09:20,500 --> 01:10:31,620
oh yeah and everything and so like um and then and then you know and then after that i didn't touch street fighter um for an entire like a year plus after that um so i'm i am i feel like technically I am still a new player because I have I don't play fighting games and like I haven't touched any uh I haven't touched any like fighting games in general and I didn't uh so yeah like I did I will say my past experience did help because it eventually start slowly came back to me but I still it was still like yeah I just learned really really quick and I was learning an entirely new character too um so i did i felt like i did improve a lot within those three days yeah um if you what's drive reversal on block i think like uh what's the what's the frame data on that yeah my fast reaction time helps too you try your best and have an open mind for anxiety and then you're in the nose thank you thank you yeah so that's why like now i'm like super afraid because a lot like even though there's like

774
01:10:31,620 --> 01:11:07,380
three other there's only like other players I'm playing against all three players like well I don't know about bash because like um I don't know about bash but I know the other two players were labbing against me um to make like you know trying to understand my mind which um which is very hard because even I don't understand my own mind uh so it also makes me very scared because in in Tekken nobody labbed me And then everyone's like,

775
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:08,100
it's fine.

776
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:11,780
Nobody, everyone's just like, it's fine.

777
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,600
No one really laughed me.

778
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:22,460
But in Street Fighter, I feel like so many people laughed because I play the most gimmicky characters, too.

779
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:27,920
I play the most, like, either the most silted characters or the most, like, gimmicky.

780
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:30,860
So that's why, like, yeah.

781
01:11:33,340 --> 01:12:05,260
for it to download something that when there's nothing there yeah how do you download something when there's nothing uh yeah i'm the knowledge check hasn't i'm like where you have to adapt basically like i i basically test how well how well you adapt to me on the flat um yeah so oh Okay.

782
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,440
I want to see what the order is.

783
01:12:15,820 --> 01:12:16,280
Oh, everyone.

784
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:18,240
No, we don't know the order yet.

785
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:20,540
Oh.

786
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:26,400
Yeah, staring into the void for too long.

787
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,860
And Doki stares back.

788
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:31,700
I got my invite.

789
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:32,580

790
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:33,840
Yeah, I got it.

791
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:34,660
I'm in already.

792
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:36,700
Okay.

793
01:12:38,600 --> 01:13:39,550
she's in oh yeah that's why I'm so nervous now that's why I'm like really really nervous because like you know the anxiety of like everyone having such like not okay not maybe not everyone you know because like I I will assume that the the opponent's chat is cheering them on but you know um oh you know how a lot of people have expectations on me so that makes me super more nervous but um not me i expect you to thank you guys i appreciate that we had to start taking training spots immediately or i'm sitting here i i appreciate that they said in every training spot to deny us the ability to practice wow i have i got i got that's smart yeah does anybody want to practice No.

794
01:13:39,850 --> 01:13:41,650
Oh, I practice against you, Dan.

795
01:13:42,030 --> 01:13:42,710
Oh, okay, okay.

796
01:13:42,830 --> 01:13:43,690
Actually, I'm playing against mine.

797
01:13:44,510 --> 01:13:47,610
The thing is, I don't know if that mine is going to be like my mine.

798
01:13:47,770 --> 01:13:50,930
So by playing against me, I might be training you for bad things.

799
01:13:52,710 --> 01:13:53,050
Yeah, probably.

800
01:13:53,230 --> 01:13:53,830
So it's all good.

801
01:13:55,310 --> 01:13:56,370
No, I'm just kidding.

802
01:13:57,150 --> 01:13:58,170
No, it's all good.

803
01:13:58,590 --> 01:13:59,530
No, it's...

804
01:13:59,530 --> 01:14:00,150

01:14:03,270 --> 01:14:03,530
Yeah.

807
01:14:03,850 --> 01:14:07,190
And I expect you to make funny Honda headbutt moves.

808
01:14:07,590 --> 01:14:08,250
And I haven't...

809
01:14:08,670 --> 01:14:10,350
this fight so far

810
01:14:14,130 --> 01:15:27,770
basically you're holding it back and forward thank you guys i really appreciate it i'm trying to shake off the anxiety emily you got to play first oh i'm first yeah it's it's you and then frodan and then me and then doki why am i last why do i have to wait could i just go now okay they don't want to put you on the on the match that's worth 20 points because they know that you would have this don't we don't do that who's the one that's worth me thanks then me twice you yeah yeah if i see he's got this i don't like that now you're good so we have to wait on there too yes we got this guys i believe oh yeah okay saving you're right so i don't got it i know y'all got it yeah yeah don't worry they saved the best for last you know how to end the show head but why does her thing not have a picture yeah i don't understand why no one has a picturing yeah there's a there's a setting no there's a setting so that like characters oh isn't oh there's no point yeah there's no point people can't use

811
01:15:27,770 --> 01:15:38,930
skins because some people use the swimsuit edition stuff and it's kind of distracting do i feel like take that out No, no, no, no, no, you can keep it because I'm not playing you.

812
01:15:39,470 --> 01:15:45,790
But yeah, it's like, you know, how can you play when you're looking at that ass?

813
01:15:46,650 --> 01:15:50,030
I think you might have to like get out of the lobby to disable it.

814
01:15:50,930 --> 01:15:51,570
Oh, I don't know.

815
01:15:52,250 --> 01:15:53,530
I don't know if you could do it on the lobby.

816
01:15:55,590 --> 01:15:55,990
Yeah.

817
01:15:56,170 --> 01:15:59,530
Okay, that I think that Zangief skin should not be allowed.

818
01:15:59,870 --> 01:16:01,110
Oh, the robot one?

819
01:16:01,330 --> 01:16:03,070
Yeah, it's like actually...

820
01:16:03,070 --> 01:16:04,150
It's actually distracting.

821
01:16:04,450 --> 01:16:06,230
Like the way that he really...

822
01:16:06,230 --> 01:16:06,510
He became...

823
01:16:06,510 --> 01:16:31,850
clinking bro like he's just here like it's so bad that's so distracting oh wait maybe we shouldn't be saying that what if they what if they're taking the tech now they're all gonna turn into clinkers oh wait is there more than one character that has that skin no i think it's no it's just zing yeah it's just my cousin keep yeah but you should turn that off then because yeah yeah let me If I leave,

824
01:16:32,010 --> 01:16:33,050
can I rejoin?

825
01:16:33,110 --> 01:16:33,510
Yeah.

826
01:16:36,710 --> 01:16:37,750
Let me see.

827
01:16:38,670 --> 01:16:39,070
Options.

828
01:16:41,390 --> 01:16:42,430
It's on matchmaking.

829
01:16:44,830 --> 01:16:45,830
Oh, it's on matchmaking?

830
01:16:46,290 --> 01:16:50,110
Yeah, like when you press square to go into matchmaking, you go like to the character select.

831
01:16:50,690 --> 01:16:52,870
You know, to pick your character, you just pick the character.

832
01:16:52,950 --> 01:16:54,510
But I think you press like...

833
01:16:54,510 --> 01:16:56,170
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

834
01:16:57,530 --> 01:16:57,930
Character.

835
01:16:58,870 --> 01:16:59,270
Oh.

836
01:17:00,890 --> 01:17:02,390
The best for that.

837
01:17:04,810 --> 01:17:05,630
I'm remembering, guys.

838
01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:08,590
We're now on the broadcast, so I'm remembering.

839
01:17:10,230 --> 01:17:10,950
No, wait.

840
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:18,920
Wait, how do I do it?

841
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:21,900
You're like, you know what?

842
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:23,740
You take your character on the...

843
01:17:23,740 --> 01:17:23,920
Yeah.

844
01:17:24,020 --> 01:17:24,540
I'm so locked.

845
01:17:24,540 --> 01:17:25,480
I don't know what you're on.

846
01:17:25,700 --> 01:17:26,840
I'm on the PS4.

847
01:17:27,020 --> 01:17:27,740
Oh, I'm on the press triangle.

848
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:28,540
Oh, opponent.

849
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:29,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

850
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:30,420
Yeah, got it.

851
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:30,880
Got it.

852
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:33,720
I'm very chill right now.

853
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:35,760
I wish Coach has played.

854
01:17:36,420 --> 01:17:37,620
I'm so chill.

855
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:38,320
Me too, man.

856
01:17:39,260 --> 01:17:40,520
We should have show match at the end.

857
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:41,380
Yeah.

858
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:42,220
I agree.

859
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:44,720
If you want to log on my account, nephew, I mean.

860
01:17:47,020 --> 01:17:50,980
Would be funny if Capcom put that, put your shame at that exact moment.

861
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:54,020
I mean, I think it's fair to say our gameplay is pretty close.

862
01:17:54,380 --> 01:17:54,880
I agree.

863
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:55,580
Yeah, me too.

864
01:17:55,700 --> 01:17:58,360
Honestly, I think your whip punishes are better than nephews.

865
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:02,060
Your ken's probably also better than his.

866
01:18:04,220 --> 01:18:05,100
Uh, true.

867
01:18:06,380 --> 01:19:16,760

870
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:39,420
Yeah.

871
01:19:39,700 --> 01:19:40,480
What is she doing?

872
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,560
Like, oh, they said there's not one freeze.

873
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:44,920
It says you guys can hit it.

874
01:19:45,020 --> 01:19:45,820
We are starting.

875
01:19:47,740 --> 01:19:48,660
You got this, Emily.

876
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:52,260
Just throw some fans.

877
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:53,520
She don't know what to do.

878
01:19:53,940 --> 01:19:54,400
Okay, okay.

879
01:19:55,460 --> 01:19:56,080
Throw fans.

880
01:20:07,590 --> 01:20:10,210
Oh my god, I don't know.

881
01:20:11,730 --> 01:20:12,250
Nice.

882
01:20:13,270 --> 01:20:14,450
Another Mecca Gif.

883
01:20:16,010 --> 01:20:18,210
Let's jump when she gets close.

884
01:20:31,590 --> 01:20:33,850
Okay, guys, don't tell my team, but like...

885
01:20:33,850 --> 01:20:34,410
Oh, you have to...

886
01:20:34,410 --> 01:20:35,430
That actually...

887
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:42,250
Don't tell my team, but I know I should be watching, but instead I'm watching Ryden's team to my head span butt bod right now.

888
01:20:42,530 --> 01:20:43,670
I want...

889
01:20:44,270 --> 01:20:47,090
I'm looking at Chad's reaction to that.

890
01:20:48,330 --> 01:20:49,690
That's how much I believe.

891
01:20:50,510 --> 01:20:52,710
That's how much I believe in my team.

892
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:05,520
Bro, okay.

893
01:21:05,780 --> 01:21:07,920
Okay, Brian's expression.

894
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:13,500
Brian's expression to me just spamming headbutt over and over again.

895
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:14,960
He's just like...

896
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:15,680
What am I supposed to do?

897
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:19,280
I don't know if he's disappointed or...

898
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:19,520
I don't know.

899
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:21,840
Anywhere near her, but I feel like I need to.

900
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:23,200
I don't know if he's...

901
01:21:23,220 --> 01:21:40,820
button drive us through and just go for a jump show everyone i just like again but again oh my god i'm so lucky yeah yep that's dokey's gameplay all right

902
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:57,080
Nice.

903
01:21:57,740 --> 01:21:58,880
Oh, nice dodge.

904
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:01,420
Okay, I have my two eyes are looking at both.

905
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:05,620
Nice dodge from Emily.

906
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:09,360
Nice dodge from Emily.

907
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:10,420
Nice.

908
01:22:10,940 --> 01:22:11,640
Oh, I have you coming?

909
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:13,420
Oops.

910
01:22:14,060 --> 01:22:15,020
That's fine.

911
01:22:16,380 --> 01:22:18,120
Brow was actually really, really?

912
01:22:18,420 --> 01:22:20,280
Brow was like, yeah, Nuki's gonna play on.

913
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:30,220
I like how someone chat was like, Toki needed five hours of coaching.

914
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:32,340
Five hours well spent.

915
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:34,060
Okay, he's jumping, she doesn't need it, of course.

916
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:37,300
You have a time step?

917
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:39,160
It was like at one hour.

918
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:41,540
You can swap between the two.

919
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:49,420
That's how much I believe in my team, guys.

920
01:22:51,340 --> 01:22:52,320
And it worked.

921
01:22:55,260 --> 01:22:56,020
Just careful.

922
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:57,160
She might be out here.

923
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:58,900
Oh my god, they're like, Doki's not new.

924
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:01,140
I haven't touched a game in a year.

925
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:03,000
You can't say that.

926
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:06,460
Brian, you know my retention was really bad.

927
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:08,480
Like, you know.

928
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:14,640
You know, it took so long to understand my mind.

929
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:18,720
Let's go, Emmy.

930
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:20,960
You're cooking.

931
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:21,540
Yeah!

932
01:23:21,540 --> 01:23:22,200
You're going crazy.

933
01:23:22,580 --> 01:23:25,020
She's jumping a lot on Wake Up now, so you can just like meet her.

934
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:26,520
Or go for grab.

935
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,460
Like, just media grab or media auto-light.

936
01:23:28,580 --> 01:23:29,100
They don't know.

937
01:23:29,260 --> 01:23:31,320
I've been watching Brian's balling.

938
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:36,080
Yeah!

939
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:46,040
Oh my god.

940
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:47,060
Emily's cooking.

941
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:47,860
I knew she was.

942
01:23:47,980 --> 01:23:51,860
I know she doesn't need my active participation right now.

943
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:54,780
I'm...

944
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:56,340
That's how much I believe.

945
01:23:59,020 --> 01:24:01,240
That's how much I believe.

946
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:19,940
Oh my god, perfect KO.

947
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:20,860
Oh my god, wait.

948
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:22,800
I saw that, but I didn't register.

949
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:27,280
Oh no.

950
01:24:27,540 --> 01:24:28,440
Wait, okay, I'm watching now.

951
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:28,880
I'm watching now.

952
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:30,340
This could be the last match.

953
01:24:30,620 --> 01:24:31,440
I'm watching.

954
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:37,080
Oh my god, that one punch.

955
01:24:37,340 --> 01:24:38,120
One punch.

956
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:46,660
Oh, no!

957
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:49,880
Oh, wait, wait.

958
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:50,220
No!

959
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:51,180
Okay, okay.

960
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:52,180
They both messed up.

961
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:52,760
That's good.

962
01:24:55,940 --> 01:24:56,600
That's good.

963
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:02,930
get away from get away from him get away from her

964
01:25:06,260 --> 01:25:45,620

965
01:25:49,960 --> 01:26:16,220
bottom bottom bottom bottom yeah nobody snitch okay four four three more three more games until two more games until it's my turn two more games until it's my turn oh

966
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:23,360
am I feeling?

967
01:26:23,740 --> 01:27:10,800
I think I'll just be nervous the entire time honestly um just because like I didn't realize there were prizes I went to like the orientation thing and then like we have to be in the orientation thing like an hour um an hour before and um i wasn't i didn't realize like wait first place goes to japan and a thousand dollar each person i i joined because i was like oh it's sponsored by capcom and i wasn't sure that like um it was supposed to go to like the capcon tournament or what uh whatever it's called i don't know exactly what it's called So,

968
01:27:11,180 --> 01:27:14,100
like, that's why I wasn't expecting, I guess.

969
01:27:16,460 --> 01:27:26,740
I didn't realize until, like, you know, when we, like, an hour before we streamed, I was like, oh, my God, wait, there's actual money involved.

970
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:34,380
I was like, oh, my God, I thought we just do it for fun.

971
01:27:34,940 --> 01:27:37,480
I'm here for it for fun.

972
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:51,780
to join for fun i'm catching your buttons also like i didn't expect to get picked too that's the thing i was not expecting to get picked in general

973
01:27:58,200 --> 01:28:14,500
because like i didn't know how many people signed up for it because like i said for those who didn't know like how the players were selected a bunch of people applied they send a capcon send me an email asking i would like to uh apply for the uh capcon uh not for the tournament And they're like,

974
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:16,840
okay, and the captains do, like, a draft system.

975
01:28:16,940 --> 01:28:19,180
So they look through the list and be like, who do we want for on our team?

976
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:21,660
So I was like, oh, yeah, I'll just sign up.

977
01:28:21,700 --> 01:28:23,500
I was like, I don't know if I'll get picked or anything.

978
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:29,500
Like, I literally, my application for it was like, I did not sell myself at all.

979
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:35,280
I was like, I don't know how to block, and I forgot how to play.

980
01:28:37,860 --> 01:28:38,580
Oh, my God.

981
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:40,060
This is like the mix-up.

982
01:28:41,380 --> 01:28:42,740
Oh, that was so close.

983
01:28:44,140 --> 01:28:46,160
It's okay, you still use the hourly meter.

984
01:28:46,580 --> 01:28:47,400
Yep, yep, yep.

985
01:29:08,470 --> 01:29:09,990
What am I what?

986
01:29:12,010 --> 01:29:13,770
Oh, my God.

987
01:29:15,370 --> 01:29:16,710
Oh, my God, that's crazy.

988
01:29:18,250 --> 01:29:19,330
Oh, my God, she's adapting.

989
01:29:19,470 --> 01:29:20,010
That's illegal.

990
01:29:20,210 --> 01:29:21,330
I play the same way.

991
01:29:23,790 --> 01:29:25,250
How dare you?

992
01:29:27,070 --> 01:29:27,930
Oh, no.

993
01:29:36,460 --> 01:29:42,920
I think you can jump out her more too.

994
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:47,820
I don't know how to use the blue button or the, what was it, the green dash.

995
01:29:47,980 --> 01:29:51,320
I know I did it on Geek, but I legitimately forgot how I did that.

996
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:56,980
My hands cannot do that many buttons.

997
01:29:57,800 --> 01:30:00,100
Yeah, that green dash, I don't know how to do that.

998
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:01,220
I forgot how.

999
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:31,200
no i know it's my l1 but like my butt my hand can't it's not cannot reach that right now it's my there's no reaction to it you're like oh jokia has good reaction time but like for the blue button and the green button the the green dash there is barely a reaction time for that yeah just headbutt headbutt and blood slam that's all i need

1000
01:30:34,700 --> 01:31:02,420
and they'll never know my first move i think i think they're going to know though later i don't know if i'm gonna beat the aki though um i think because like uh the aki player has had a lot of experience playing fgc okay but we'll do our best yeah don't mess with that winning formula if i get one round off of the aki that's all that mad that i'll be so happy

1001
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:40,100
Jesus Oh no They don't want us to talk when they're playing Because they'll be too distracting for them Yeah I got mirror Yeah I think also you can drive rush or her more She's not really checking it Okay You're talking I can't give any tips All I can be like Good job guys I don't know what's going on They're like Oh you can drive rush Blah blah blah And I'm like What I'm just like,

1002
01:31:40,180 --> 01:31:43,120
I have no idea what they're talking about.

1003
01:31:43,420 --> 01:31:49,880
Like, they're just giving advice.

1004
01:31:50,140 --> 01:31:53,060
All I can do is like, good job, guys.

1005
01:31:53,380 --> 01:31:54,880
You're doing great.

1006
01:31:56,040 --> 01:31:57,360
That's my feedback.

1007
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:02,040
God, this is like the poke game of the century.

1008
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:05,400
Bro, there's so much blocking.

1009
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:06,100
I hate this.

1010
01:32:09,240 --> 01:32:10,820
Too much blocking.

1011
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:12,120
More attack, please.

1012
01:32:12,140 --> 01:32:12,900
Oh, no.

1013
01:32:13,460 --> 01:32:15,020
You might be wise, so...

1014
01:32:15,020 --> 01:32:15,630
Okay, yeah.

1015
01:32:21,260 --> 01:32:21,840
Oh, man.

1016
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:23,100
My timings were just off.

1017
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:24,600
Good try, good try.

1018
01:32:25,460 --> 01:32:26,160
Don't worry.

1019
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:27,460
It's looking okay.

1020
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:27,980
Yeah.

1021
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:28,960
I should have...

1022
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:30,220
I think it was...

1023
01:32:30,220 --> 01:32:31,140
I could have won by then.

1024
01:32:31,660 --> 01:32:32,180
It's okay.

1025
01:32:32,260 --> 01:32:33,600
We fight them again.

1026
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:34,520
Yeah.

1027
01:32:34,620 --> 01:32:36,060
I still just win this.

1028
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:37,960
Oh, my...

1029
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:39,320
Oh, my...

1030
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:45,840
or make it close you know you don't have to just make it close if i don't got it don't he got it

1031
01:32:51,480 --> 01:33:28,120
all right no she's doing a good job like keeping me out because like i thought i could jump yeah we fight just rely on the 10-pointer and she was like checking my dry brush so it was like and then the fans are drafted pretty well yeah yeah that's all good no i'm not a 10-pointer now i'm a uh i mean i'm not a 20-pointer i'm a 10-pointer um it's it's only the third match the third match is the 10 pointer wait is it it's like first to 50 or no i don't at this point i don't even know anymore i don't understand the first to 50 thing because it's like we already got our 50.

1032
01:33:30,140 --> 01:33:41,720
i think that's for the matches like later oh seating i see i see so we just have to play everyone Okay, and then after this is like the real game.

1033
01:33:41,720 --> 01:33:42,920
We played them again, I think.

1034
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:47,560
Yeah, afterwards, they see us in the playoff bracket and depending on where we are.

1035
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:48,640
We play.

1036
01:33:48,820 --> 01:33:50,400
It's better to be higher suited though.

1037
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:54,820
Wait, do we not play them again on the opposite side?

1038
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:56,340
No, no, no.

1039
01:33:56,780 --> 01:34:02,560
What happens from here is we play every team one time, and then they rank the teams based off their performance in the group stage.

1040
01:34:02,980 --> 01:34:05,260
And then if you're the best performing team, you go straight to the finals.

1041
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:08,580
If you're the second best performing team, you wait in the semi-finals.

1042
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:42,560
we go if we if we're the number one performing team then we're just waiting in the finals okay I was thinking if um because we played them on home team right we played as them as home team I didn't know if we played them as a way also no no we don't have that's it yeah I think the first he'd also one gets home advantage in the finals so like you really want to be first okay hi yeah we get to chill it's okay if we're not yeah we could yeah we'll climb our way up We get extra warm-up Yeah,

1043
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:59,040
and if not nephew will warm up the opponents for us as well No, no, no last team they basically have to do like they have to fight everyone Basically if they make it I was gonna say like which one I forgot it's been so loud.

1044
01:34:59,340 --> 01:35:08,480
I just forgot who which one is like our player Oh my god But these guys are gamers

1045
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:15,680
I swear, I don't see, like, any Honda's in my, you know.

1046
01:35:16,840 --> 01:35:19,560
I still think I fought, like, one Honda the entire time.

1047
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:22,220
During my climb, and I won.

1048
01:35:23,020 --> 01:35:27,240
The Honda was actually trying, and I was like, hit, but...

1049
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:33,380
Oh, no.

1050
01:35:35,100 --> 01:35:36,680
God, stupid blocks.

1051
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:40,120
Whoa!

1052
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:51,220
Only after this is my turn.

1053
01:35:56,720 --> 01:35:57,500
Jesus, the corner.

1054
01:35:57,780 --> 01:36:01,920
I assume like Kimberly doesn't do much damage, but she's really really fast.

1055
01:36:04,140 --> 01:36:05,140
Does it hit?

1056
01:36:05,660 --> 01:36:06,320
Oh, yeah!

1057
01:36:07,740 --> 01:36:09,400
Now I just try and DI her here.

1058
01:36:10,220 --> 01:36:12,640
I'm gonna go for a driver's jab just in case.

1059
01:36:17,810 --> 01:36:18,230
Oh.

1060
01:36:20,550 --> 01:36:21,330
Oh god.

1061
01:36:22,150 --> 01:36:23,470
Oh my god, it's so...

1062
01:36:23,470 --> 01:36:24,850
Oh my god, he's so...

1063
01:36:24,850 --> 01:36:25,570
He's so scared.

1064
01:36:26,410 --> 01:36:27,370
That was so risky.

1065
01:36:27,730 --> 01:36:29,330
You are nasty.

1066
01:36:29,650 --> 01:36:30,330
I like it.

1067
01:36:31,170 --> 01:36:31,610
Thank you.

1068
01:36:31,650 --> 01:36:33,330
Oh my god, he was so scared of you.

1069
01:36:35,070 --> 01:36:36,450
I'm scared of myself.

1070
01:36:38,630 --> 01:36:40,150
Oh yeah, once you're just like me.

1071
01:36:41,610 --> 01:36:43,730
Once I get you in the corner, it's too late.

1072
01:36:47,470 --> 01:36:49,330
Oh, oh, oh no.

1073
01:36:49,710 --> 01:36:51,230
Oh, yeah, he does a lot of damage.

1074
01:36:51,610 --> 01:36:52,390
Look at that damage.

1075
01:36:53,930 --> 01:36:54,570
Oh, my God.

1076
01:36:54,790 --> 01:36:55,350
Oh, my God.

1077
01:36:55,450 --> 01:36:56,130
Stop adapting.

1078
01:36:59,490 --> 01:37:00,950
Play the same way.

1079
01:37:04,110 --> 01:37:04,510
Oh,

1080
01:37:10,430 --> 01:37:12,270
is that not how Kimberly's supposed to look like?

1081
01:37:13,390 --> 01:37:15,910
I was like, that's the way I legitimately thought that was how...

1082
01:37:16,470 --> 01:37:18,710
All the Kimberly's I thought looked like this.

1083
01:37:20,690 --> 01:37:43,410
i thought one other kimberly and she looked like this if you see her walking forward you can like jump in with a button but if you see her just like charging back for the cycle question i just legitimately at that point i thought this was part of the game like part of her default okay oh my god it is it's not over yet

1084
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:54,360
jesus you know so much i hate it i hate them I hate that he's adapting.

1085
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:56,400
Oh!

1086
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:57,360
Press the wrong button.

1087
01:37:57,820 --> 01:37:59,660
Okay, I thought that was so cool though.

1088
01:38:00,180 --> 01:38:01,280
But I guess not.

1089
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:02,780
I think I was left.

1090
01:38:03,560 --> 01:38:03,760
Yeah.

1091
01:38:05,260 --> 01:38:07,900
I thought she like dodged it and everything.

1092
01:38:08,060 --> 01:38:09,040
I was like, that's so cool.

1093
01:38:16,670 --> 01:38:17,150
Jesus.

1094
01:38:17,690 --> 01:38:18,630
The chip damage.

1095
01:38:19,370 --> 01:38:21,230
That really sucks when you're burned out.

1096
01:38:23,410 --> 01:38:24,870
Oh my god, one...

1097
01:38:24,870 --> 01:38:26,850
the one HP and dream right here.

1098
01:38:30,270 --> 01:38:30,670
Oh,

1099
01:38:33,890 --> 01:38:34,670
that's so scary.

1100
01:38:37,030 --> 01:38:37,230
Wow.

1101
01:38:37,990 --> 01:38:40,070
Oh, that was close.

1102
01:38:40,330 --> 01:38:41,010
That was close.

1103
01:38:45,170 --> 01:38:45,190
Whoa.

1104
01:38:48,490 --> 01:38:49,930
That was so close.

1105
01:38:59,200 --> 01:38:59,680
That's the thing.

1106
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:01,000
I don't know which team is the strongest.

1107
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:02,720
Yeah, because there's a lot of players.

1108
01:39:03,740 --> 01:39:05,680
I haven't researched any of the other players.

1109
01:39:06,740 --> 01:39:08,720
Oh, nice reaction.

1110
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:12,260
Yeah, this is a 20.1.

1111
01:39:14,820 --> 01:39:15,680
So this is like...

1112
01:39:15,680 --> 01:39:17,740
They believe in this guy the most.

1113
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:19,000
Whoa, perfect!

1114
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:20,200
That's crazy.

1115
01:39:21,060 --> 01:39:21,760
The throw loop.

1116
01:39:22,120 --> 01:39:23,220
They don't expect the fifth one.

1117
01:39:23,320 --> 01:39:23,940
That's the thing.

1118
01:39:24,120 --> 01:39:26,320
Like, you're like, there's no way she'll do it again.

1119
01:39:26,680 --> 01:39:27,820
See, this is why I always headbutt.

1120
01:39:28,300 --> 01:39:30,300
Because they're like, there's no way she'll do it again.

1121
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:34,040
Exactly why.

1122
01:39:37,660 --> 01:40:04,200
it oh no perfect no oh no this is really bad because he feels like he does so much oh is it oh it hits after you block scissor kick and burn out you can jab the zero at best okay because like the chip damage for it seems so scary in general oh

1123
01:40:10,060 --> 01:40:11,320
Oh, nice!

1124
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:17,580
Yeah, you could probably do more neutral zones, too.

1125
01:40:17,900 --> 01:40:19,820
Because she gets baited to cycle pressure, though.

1126
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:20,900
Okay, last match.

1127
01:40:23,720 --> 01:40:24,240
Crazy.

1128
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:25,800
Everyone's adapting now.

1129
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:30,880
Oh, hello.

1130
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:36,840
Oh, so much blocking.

1131
01:40:36,920 --> 01:40:37,840
I'm not used to it.

1132
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:39,240
It might, though.

1133
01:40:39,620 --> 01:40:40,020
Nobody blocks.

1134
01:40:44,040 --> 01:40:45,840
Am I, you know what?

1135
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:47,760
Everyone just attacks.

1136
01:40:51,890 --> 01:40:54,750
Is this what Street Fighter is supposed to look like?

1137
01:40:56,750 --> 01:41:01,430
I'm like, oh my god, this is what Street Fighter is supposed to look like.

1138
01:41:01,770 --> 01:41:03,710
The one time that I don't drive is yet.

1139
01:41:06,930 --> 01:41:08,310
I'm not used to it.

1140
01:41:08,730 --> 01:41:11,130
This is like a different game I'm watching right now.

1141
01:41:11,690 --> 01:41:39,530
what I had to play from all the ring matches I played this is so different that dodge is so sick though like even though like she didn't hit it like she didn't she got hit at the end that dodge is crazy it was scary oh my god it's lagging you can wait for some drive gauge to come back or that works for you just started lagging a little bit it's okay

1142
01:41:45,670 --> 01:41:46,850
Yeah, it's hi, Master.

1143
01:41:48,110 --> 01:41:51,730
Yeah, but even then, like, I felt like everyone else was, like, blocking, and I was, like...

1144
01:41:54,490 --> 01:41:57,490
For me, I was just like, I'm just attacked.

1145
01:42:07,740 --> 01:42:08,460
Good job.

1146
01:42:10,060 --> 01:42:11,880
What does this spray paint mean, guys?

1147
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:13,500
Oh, my God, it just... What?

1148
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:14,180
What was that?

1149
01:42:16,980 --> 01:42:19,020
Oh, my God, what did he... It just lagged so bad.

1150
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:20,780
It looked like she dropped a combo.

1151
01:42:20,980 --> 01:42:22,720
I don't even know that's fine.

1152
01:42:22,820 --> 01:42:23,600
Oh, it's Kimberly.

1153
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:33,800
Kimberly's playing right now All right, sorry, that's her name feisty sorry feisty Her name is but that's Kimberly.

1154
01:42:34,300 --> 01:42:35,360
I forgot that's a kid.

1155
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:36,480
Sorry feisty.

1156
01:42:38,300 --> 01:42:44,500
That's Bruh, that's Kimberly's name What should I do?

1157
01:42:44,940 --> 01:42:46,060
You could do the driver's job

1158
01:42:49,640 --> 01:42:56,760
she she is kimberly have you think about it jesus

1159
01:43:01,680 --> 01:43:48,580
oh no oh no not the throw loop no no no no no oh nice oh that was so close yeah just when you jump don't do the elbow drop just if you're five it's best of five what the heck i've never seen that move before yeah yeah there's one more round god being the 20 pointer sucks nice yeah first to three is it two two i thought it was two one i'm sorry they all blurred all these matches have blurred together

1160
01:43:54,240 --> 01:43:59,680
continuous match, you know, like, it feels like I've been watching one big game.

1161
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:01,280
Yeah,

1162
01:44:06,200 --> 01:44:07,400
she can get that even in Lurna.

1163
01:44:12,610 --> 01:44:16,470
Oh my god, that's smart as hell, and I wonder if this guy was their 20 pointer.

1164
01:44:17,750 --> 01:44:19,730
Because they pick who gets to be the 20 pointer.

1165
01:44:24,270 --> 01:44:25,170
Yeah, they're smart.

1166
01:44:26,670 --> 01:44:28,450
You can try and do more run stops.

1167
01:44:28,890 --> 01:44:31,250
Because if she does DI, you could DI back if you run stop.

1168
01:44:32,170 --> 01:44:32,530
Okay.

1169
01:44:35,230 --> 01:44:36,130
Wait, is that bison?

1170
01:44:37,190 --> 01:44:39,150
I just realized, bro.

1171
01:44:39,590 --> 01:44:41,210
I was like, oh my God, wait, this is bison.

1172
01:44:41,290 --> 01:44:42,910
I thought it was a different character.

1173
01:44:43,210 --> 01:44:44,190
I didn't even realize.

1174
01:44:46,110 --> 01:44:48,110
I was like, man, I've never seen this character before.

1175
01:44:48,810 --> 01:44:50,750
I just realized it was bison.

1176
01:44:54,110 --> 01:44:56,330
The costume looks so different.

1177
01:44:57,230 --> 01:44:59,370
Yeah, I literally just realized it.

1178
01:45:00,390 --> 01:45:02,010
Yeah, that skin is crazy.

1179
01:45:06,050 --> 01:45:07,290
Oh, okay, I see it now.

1180
01:45:07,450 --> 01:45:09,410
I see his, like, little foot thing.

1181
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:13,720
Oh, my God.

1182
01:45:15,740 --> 01:45:15,780
Damn.

1183
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:17,560
What a combo.

1184
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:22,180
Oh, my God.

1185
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:23,080
He's still...

1186
01:45:23,080 --> 01:45:24,480
He's still alive.

1187
01:45:25,220 --> 01:45:26,060
Oh, that's scary.

1188
01:45:29,340 --> 01:45:30,220
Oh, they're so scared.

1189
01:45:30,600 --> 01:45:31,040
Oh.

1190
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:34,020
Oh, my gosh.

1191
01:45:34,060 --> 01:45:34,720
That's scary.

1192
01:45:41,400 --> 01:45:42,740
Try and bait a dry reversal

1193
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:54,980
Oh my gosh Nice What a combo Oh

1194
01:45:59,360 --> 01:46:09,940

01:46:13,220 --> 01:46:41,620
Oh That charge is freaky oh my god get off get off of her oh my gosh oh they're all so scared now everyone is like everyone's doing chip damage too oh that chip damage oh no oh Oh no.

1196
01:46:44,240 --> 01:46:45,080
No.

1197
01:46:53,290 --> 01:46:53,830
Let's go.

1198
01:46:54,490 --> 01:46:54,730
Yeah!

1199
01:46:55,810 --> 01:46:56,450
Oh my god.

1200
01:46:57,750 --> 01:47:02,050
That was crazy.

1201
01:47:06,170 --> 01:47:07,050
Oh my god.

1202
01:47:07,210 --> 01:47:07,630
I'm shaking.

1203
01:47:08,890 --> 01:47:10,950
Oh my god.

1204
01:47:11,510 --> 01:47:12,910
That was insane.

1205
01:47:12,910 --> 01:47:13,910
That was actually clutch.

1206
01:47:14,630 --> 01:47:15,730
That was actually clutch.

1207
01:47:17,110 --> 01:47:49,950
my god oh wow i'm sweaty man i don't know how to i don't know how to follow that up honestly not enough deodorant for my armpits but i know oh my goodness gracious oh thank god i have to play after that game you got it oh man i was sweating watching that one yeah my hands the riskiest thing I could have possibly done.

1208
01:47:50,290 --> 01:47:51,270
The TP, was it the TP?

1209
01:47:52,010 --> 01:47:55,050
No, it was the, like, I did the overhead.

1210
01:47:55,350 --> 01:48:01,810
I did, like, a combo on block into Drybrush overhead, a reset on my overhead at the end.

1211
01:48:04,650 --> 01:48:05,810
I wasn't playing it.

1212
01:48:05,970 --> 01:48:09,590
I have a heart rate monitor when I play fighting games, and I got to, like, almost 1.40 watching.

1213
01:48:09,710 --> 01:48:13,370
Dude, if I had a heart rate monitor, it would be on, I don't even know.

1214
01:48:13,530 --> 01:48:15,690
Yeah, watching it gave me, like, anxiety.

1215
01:48:17,110 --> 01:48:17,490
God.

1216
01:48:18,670 --> 01:48:19,070
All right.

1217
01:48:19,370 --> 01:48:20,130
I don't know.

1218
01:48:20,350 --> 01:48:21,030
He's a rookie.

1219
01:48:21,530 --> 01:48:21,910
I don't.

1220
01:48:22,010 --> 01:48:24,230
Guys, no, no, no, anything can happen.

1221
01:48:24,370 --> 01:48:24,650
You got this.

1222
01:48:24,830 --> 01:48:25,030
You got this.

1223
01:48:25,050 --> 01:48:25,790
And butt his ass.

1224
01:48:26,510 --> 01:48:27,130
You're right.

1225
01:48:34,550 --> 01:48:35,430
Oh, okay.

1226
01:48:37,390 --> 01:48:37,970
Okay, what?

1227
01:48:39,110 --> 01:48:39,990
Okay, what?

1228
01:48:40,310 --> 01:48:40,570
Okay.

1229
01:48:40,570 --> 01:48:42,050
I was gonna say what happened to him.

1230
01:48:53,240 --> 01:48:54,100
You can just keep...

1231
01:48:54,100 --> 01:48:54,680
You can't block this again!

1232
01:48:55,940 --> 01:48:58,160
This is why I go burn out.

1233
01:49:00,420 --> 01:49:02,400
I learned that they can't...

1234
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:05,320
They don't know how to block that for some reason.

1235
01:49:08,500 --> 01:49:09,020
Oh.

1236
01:49:10,680 --> 01:49:12,580
If you block that, just do your heavy auto combo.

1237
01:49:12,900 --> 01:49:13,160
Okay.

1238
01:49:15,700 --> 01:49:16,800
They don't block this.

1239
01:49:24,190 --> 01:49:25,370
Let's go, Doki.

1240
01:49:27,070 --> 01:49:28,710
That's why I go to...

1241
01:49:28,710 --> 01:49:29,410
Wait, he left.

1242
01:49:30,590 --> 01:49:32,410
Why did he leave?

1243
01:49:34,570 --> 01:49:35,930
He did...

1244
01:49:35,930 --> 01:49:37,290
He wouldn't have done to me.

1245
01:49:37,770 --> 01:49:39,090
That's my thing!

1246
01:49:41,070 --> 01:49:41,470
Damn.

1247
01:49:47,410 --> 01:49:48,630
Oh my god.

1248
01:49:48,970 --> 01:49:49,630
You're cooking.

1249
01:49:50,050 --> 01:49:53,310
I'm not to watch this intro again?

1250
01:49:54,310 --> 01:49:55,310
You can skip it.

1251
01:49:55,330 --> 01:49:57,190
No, I'm making him watch it.

1252
01:49:59,370 --> 01:50:00,510
I ain't skipping.

1253
01:50:04,170 --> 01:50:04,970
That's me.

1254
01:50:10,380 --> 01:50:11,340
Oh, oh my gosh.

1255
01:50:12,940 --> 01:50:13,540
That's right.

1256
01:50:13,780 --> 01:50:15,120
What would I do next?

1257
01:50:19,550 --> 01:50:21,610
What would I do next, bro?

1258
01:50:24,530 --> 01:50:25,230
That's right.

1259
01:50:25,330 --> 01:50:26,030
What would I do?

1260
01:50:26,310 --> 01:50:28,750
There you go.

1261
01:50:29,610 --> 01:50:29,930
Nice.

1262
01:50:32,470 --> 01:50:33,210
Yay!

1263
01:50:41,010 --> 01:50:42,670
What would I do next?

1264
01:50:43,070 --> 01:50:43,170
Oh.

1265
01:50:45,610 --> 01:50:46,730
That's fine.

1266
01:50:48,870 --> 01:50:48,970
Oh.

1267
01:50:51,670 --> 01:50:52,710
Oh, what?

1268
01:50:56,060 --> 01:50:56,720
It's okay.

1269
01:50:57,820 --> 01:50:59,520
That means I can do my thing again.

1270
01:51:00,660 --> 01:51:00,900
Alright.

1271
01:51:02,060 --> 01:51:02,800
Oh.

1272
01:51:03,300 --> 01:51:04,200
My grab didn't wait.

1273
01:51:05,080 --> 01:51:05,460
Sad.

1274
01:51:13,510 --> 01:51:14,030
Yay!

1275
01:51:15,130 --> 01:51:16,510
Okay, that was fast.

1276
01:51:17,050 --> 01:51:17,870
Let's go!

1277
01:51:18,490 --> 01:51:20,270
Oh my god, you're so good.

1278
01:51:21,150 --> 01:51:21,610
Yay!

1279
01:51:22,770 --> 01:51:23,770
Nice job.

1280
01:51:24,010 --> 01:51:25,210
I ain't here to block.

1281
01:51:25,710 --> 01:51:26,510
Let's go.

1282
01:51:26,770 --> 01:51:27,310
Nah, man.

1283
01:51:27,450 --> 01:51:28,850
We didn't pay 60 bucks to block.

1284
01:51:29,010 --> 01:51:29,850
Yeah, exactly.

1285
01:51:30,230 --> 01:51:31,410
I ain't here to block.

1286
01:51:35,250 --> 01:51:42,610
It felt like I was watching twice these match for like 20 minutes and then mine was just gone in five seconds.

1287
01:51:42,630 --> 01:51:45,350
Oh my god, I felt like I was playing it for 20 minutes, huh?

1288
01:51:48,250 --> 01:51:50,690
The contrast to the intensity of the last set.

1289
01:51:51,270 --> 01:51:54,150
Yeah, they see before Doki every time.

1290
01:51:54,590 --> 01:51:56,990
Ten of us four times refuses to elaborate and leaves.

1291
01:52:01,050 --> 01:52:02,150
Oh, that was good.

1292
01:52:02,390 --> 01:52:03,690
Y'all team, we're going crazy.

1293
01:52:04,050 --> 01:52:04,870
Another round in.

1294
01:52:06,810 --> 01:52:07,890
One more team.

1295
01:52:07,930 --> 01:52:08,690
One more team.

1296
01:52:08,850 --> 01:52:09,510
One more team.

1297
01:52:11,330 --> 01:52:12,390
Oh my god.

1298
01:52:13,570 --> 01:52:16,010
I just need to do it too.

1299
01:52:18,310 --> 01:52:19,470
You gotta be on top, right?

1300
01:52:20,050 --> 01:52:22,450
You gotta be the most points.

1301
01:52:22,850 --> 01:52:26,370
Unless you just have to do well in the last match.

1302
01:52:26,810 --> 01:52:29,310
The other team, I think, might be the hardest, right?

1303
01:52:30,290 --> 01:52:34,290
Yeah, unless I don't got 50 this time, because they got 40 the last match.

1304
01:52:35,090 --> 01:52:36,030
Oh, so they got the same.

1305
01:52:36,970 --> 01:52:37,370
Yeah.

1306
01:52:38,210 --> 01:52:41,230
So the next- Wait, so are we home or are we away next match?

1307
01:52:41,310 --> 01:52:41,890
We're home.

1308
01:52:42,290 --> 01:52:42,550
Nothing.

1309
01:52:42,630 --> 01:53:23,510
okay so it's good for us oh no i don't want to be i don't want to be there i feel like doki's like significantly more practice than the other four seeds oh okay but the the aki their aki has been playing a lot longer than me yeah i agree that he has been playing for a long time not they're not new oh yeah they're like flat two so i mean i'm okay with going but don't don't count on me too much you know yeah he had a year on her main i had three days on honda don't put me on the third seat

1310
01:53:27,130 --> 01:53:42,490
bro nobody want to do the 20 points because it's just a lot of responsibility exactly exactly i agree you're on the team down you guys are doing so good so bro i was sweating i'm like oh my god i'm gonna let my team down it's gonna be over No, no, don't worry.

1311
01:53:42,630 --> 01:53:44,890
I'll let our team down first, so you don't...

1312
01:53:44,890 --> 01:53:47,490
I'll throw the next game, so...

1313
01:53:48,530 --> 01:53:50,290
You can't look at it like that.

1314
01:53:53,290 --> 01:53:54,510
Oh, my God.

1315
01:53:55,690 --> 01:53:57,750
So, IDOM is...

1316
01:53:57,750 --> 01:53:58,590
That's CarQ, right?

1317
01:53:58,590 --> 01:53:59,230
The Honda player?

1318
01:54:00,850 --> 01:54:01,150
Yeah.

1319
01:54:01,570 --> 01:54:01,850
Yeah.

1320
01:54:03,390 --> 01:54:04,850
Oh, they're labbing right now, guys.

1321
01:54:04,930 --> 01:54:06,770
They're literally labbing against me right now.

1322
01:54:06,990 --> 01:54:07,770
This Japanese party...

1323
01:54:07,770 --> 01:54:09,750
Their coach is labbing against me!

1324
01:54:10,050 --> 01:54:11,250
What the heck?

1325
01:54:11,830 --> 01:54:12,870
Help your other players.

1326
01:54:12,890 --> 01:54:13,730
So we're tied with them.

1327
01:54:13,930 --> 01:54:15,630
So it's basically whoever wins.

1328
01:54:16,130 --> 01:54:18,790
They're actually laving against me right now.

1329
01:54:18,810 --> 01:54:20,450
Where are we sitting with the coaches?

1330
01:54:21,250 --> 01:54:23,870
I'm literally watching the coach laving.

1331
01:54:24,470 --> 01:54:24,970
I trust spicy.

1332
01:54:26,390 --> 01:54:28,330
Don't trust me too much, man.

1333
01:54:29,390 --> 01:54:30,050
I'm saying.

1334
01:54:31,030 --> 01:54:32,330
It's another bison, right?

1335
01:54:32,770 --> 01:54:33,990
Yeah, it's another bison.

1336
01:54:34,450 --> 01:54:35,130
I trust the anti-tech.

1337
01:54:35,310 --> 01:54:36,610
You look good against bison.

1338
01:54:36,970 --> 01:54:37,430
Did I?

1339
01:54:37,530 --> 01:54:39,210
Because that was last hit.

1340
01:54:40,110 --> 01:54:41,810
Last game, last round, last round.

1341
01:54:41,830 --> 01:54:45,230

That's right.

1356
01:57:54,910 --> 01:57:55,970
Nobody ever expects this moon.

1357
01:57:56,430 --> 01:57:57,310
For some reason.

1358
01:58:03,700 --> 01:58:05,480
Get out of here.

1359
01:58:06,380 --> 01:58:08,060
I'll give you a freebie round.

1360
01:58:09,420 --> 01:58:09,720
Um.

1361
01:58:11,480 --> 01:58:13,460
That's right, I'm fighting the Master Ryu.

1362
01:58:13,700 --> 01:58:14,920
All right, where's the Master Ryu?

1363
01:58:15,920 --> 01:58:17,540
Where's the one Master Ryu?

1364
01:58:17,740 --> 01:58:19,100
All right, why don't you guys get out?

1365
01:58:19,220 --> 01:58:20,620
I need to fight the Master Ryu.

1366
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:24,900
Adam, get out.

1367
01:58:26,220 --> 01:58:26,880
You lost.

1368
01:58:27,640 --> 01:58:28,260
We're trapped.

1369
01:58:28,600 --> 01:58:30,600
I need to do one game with that Ryu.

1370
01:58:32,940 --> 01:58:33,860
Oh, wait, here we go.

1371
01:58:33,980 --> 01:58:34,500
Okay, never mind.

1372
01:58:34,600 --> 01:58:35,280
We'll do this side.

1373
01:58:35,660 --> 01:58:37,840
All right, Master Ryu, get in here.

1374
01:58:39,140 --> 01:58:40,380
Let's see how...

1375
01:58:41,800 --> 01:58:46,580
Let's see if I survive longer than like 10 seconds.

1376
01:58:46,820 --> 01:58:48,300
Let's see if I can get a hit in.

1377
01:58:53,200 --> 01:58:55,760
My goal is to get one hit in.

1378
01:58:56,080 --> 01:58:58,340
Jesus, 35,000.

1379
01:59:01,480 --> 01:59:01,700
Oh.

1380
01:59:02,420 --> 01:59:03,720
Oh, whoa.

1381
01:59:05,340 --> 01:59:06,320
Oh, my God.

1382
01:59:07,080 --> 01:59:08,180
Oh, my God.

1383
01:59:09,900 --> 01:59:11,540
Oh, my God.

1384
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:12,520
Oh, my.

1385
01:59:21,370 --> 01:59:23,290
Oh, God, you got hit by a plop player.

1386
01:59:23,390 --> 01:59:24,490
You got hit by a plop player.

1387
01:59:24,670 --> 01:59:25,310
That's so embarrassing.

1388
01:59:25,630 --> 01:59:27,550
Oh, that's so embarrassing, bro.

1389
01:59:30,870 --> 01:59:32,370

1390
01:59:32,930 --> 01:59:33,770
Oh, my God.

Bro!

1393
01:59:42,450 --> 01:59:43,510
I told you.

1394
01:59:43,530 --> 01:59:45,010
You can't figure out my mind.

1395
01:59:45,650 --> 01:59:46,610
Oh, you're going to grab me?

1396
01:59:46,650 --> 01:59:47,810
I'll grab you back.

1397
01:59:48,490 --> 01:59:50,410
Oh, my God.

1398
01:59:55,590 --> 01:59:58,310
Oh, you should expect that, bro.

1399
01:59:59,030 --> 01:59:59,590
You can't.

1400
01:59:59,970 --> 02:00:01,310
I told you, you don't.

1401
02:00:02,310 --> 02:00:04,490
Bro, people don't know how to predict my mind.

1402
02:00:14,220 --> 02:00:14,840
Oh, no.

1403
02:00:15,100 --> 02:00:15,600
Oh, no.

1404
02:00:16,880 --> 02:00:17,320
Oh, no.

1405
02:00:17,320 --> 02:00:17,660
Oh, no.

1406
02:00:17,740 --> 02:00:17,840
Oh, no.

1407
02:00:18,140 --> 02:00:18,300
Oh, no.

1408
02:00:19,540 --> 02:00:20,420
Oh, no.

1409
02:00:20,500 --> 02:00:21,060
It's okay.

1410
02:00:21,220 --> 02:00:21,680
I got...

1411
02:00:21,680 --> 02:00:22,060
You know what?

1412
02:00:22,360 --> 02:00:24,400
I am proud of myself, guys.

1413
02:00:24,720 --> 02:00:27,300
Like, I am so proud of myself.

1414
02:00:27,320 --> 02:00:27,580
crowd.

1415
02:00:27,900 --> 02:00:30,480
Oh, guess who takes a round off you?

1416
02:00:34,060 --> 02:00:35,300
Oh, my God.

1417
02:00:35,420 --> 02:00:37,800
It's about sending a message, guys.

1418
02:00:38,180 --> 02:00:41,080
I got a round off a master player.

1419
02:00:42,460 --> 02:00:43,580
Let's go.

1420
02:00:44,280 --> 02:00:45,400
No shot.

1421
02:00:45,600 --> 02:00:46,340
I got a round.

1422
02:00:46,860 --> 02:00:47,580
That's right.

1423
02:00:47,760 --> 02:00:48,760
I told you.

1424
02:00:49,640 --> 02:00:51,840
You don't know what I'm thinking.

1425
02:00:54,640 --> 02:00:55,600
Oh, my God.

1426
02:00:55,700 --> 02:00:56,020
Oh, my God.

1427
02:00:56,120 --> 02:00:57,140
He's throwing it down.

1428
02:00:58,080 --> 02:00:59,460
You didn't surrender!

1429
02:01:06,040 --> 02:01:06,740
That's right!

1430
02:01:06,940 --> 02:01:07,840
You didn't expect that, right?

1431
02:01:07,900 --> 02:01:08,800
You didn't expect me to block!

1432
02:01:09,540 --> 02:01:11,260
You didn't expect me to jump over that too!

1433
02:01:12,320 --> 02:01:14,320
Nobody ever expects it!

1434
02:01:17,680 --> 02:01:18,960
Oh shit, okay.

1435
02:01:27,260 --> 02:01:29,440
Whoa, whoa, whoa, oh no.

1436
02:01:31,400 --> 02:01:33,020
Oh, no, this is bad.

1437
02:01:33,840 --> 02:01:34,380
Oh!

1438
02:01:43,960 --> 02:01:45,980
I don't think Ruda's for you, bro.

1439
02:01:46,640 --> 02:01:48,800
Guys, I don't think Ruda's for him.

1440
02:01:54,820 --> 02:01:56,240
Bro, what happened?

1441
02:01:58,260 --> 02:01:59,180

I can't touch it.

1468
02:04:36,970 --> 02:04:37,890
He's too tall.

1469
02:04:39,690 --> 02:04:39,970

02:04:47,630 --> 02:04:48,030
What?

1473
02:04:48,030 --> 02:04:48,150

Nice.

1527
02:10:19,600 --> 02:10:27,460

Mm hmm.

1532
02:10:57,500 --> 02:11:02,200

1533
02:11:04,500 --> 02:11:04,940
Damn.

You know what?

1539
02:11:10,360 --> 02:11:10,840

Like, what do you get from just like the default price?

1541
02:11:15,660 --> 02:11:17,500
You get nothing pretty much.

1542

Well, you get to hang out with her, but you can't you can talk to her.

1543
02:11:22,160 --> 02:11:54,260
so just a conversation talking at least yeah the talking is free i see okay talking how many stars did you give her afterwards oh there was i don't think there was a place to rate her really and how they get recommended um on the website like they just have a bunch of girls listed they have like 50 girls listed and with like just huge descriptions about them and what they like to do and then you pick one oh so what did you where was the description that made you pick the one you did She speaks English.

1544
02:11:56,400 --> 02:11:58,520
Did she speak good English or was it like broken English?

1545
02:11:58,600 --> 02:11:59,280
Oh, it was pretty good.

1546
02:11:59,300 --> 02:12:00,080

I think it was like $3,400.

1551
02:12:13,140 --> 02:12:14,180
How much?

1552
02:12:15,280 --> 02:12:16,320

02:12:16,840 --> 02:12:18,380
Okay, okay, never again, guys.

1554
02:12:18,660 --> 02:12:21,420
The thing is, I don't know if the price all is double for streaming.

02:12:22,160 --> 02:12:23,340
How long was the date?

1556
02:12:23,400 --> 02:12:24,440
That amount of money in my life.

02:12:24,720 --> 02:12:25,700
How long was the date?

1558
02:12:27,820 --> 02:12:29,200
Uh, like four hours?

1559
02:12:29,780 --> 02:12:32,080

There's no extra charges, too.

1565
02:12:44,460 --> 02:12:45,260
No extra charges.

1566
02:12:45,260 --> 02:12:45,920
Everything's included.

1567
02:12:46,360 --> 02:12:47,300
One-time payment.

02:12:49,640 --> 02:12:51,740
No, she said 3,400 guys.

1571
02:12:51,740 --> 02:13:25,160

1572
02:13:28,440 --> 02:14:06,700
you make it sound like it wasn't enjoyable well the talking was fun it like it got pretty like better you know obviously it would but like as the time went on when we got to know each other better but yeah i mean just because did you go straight for it did you like can like you met her you introduced names and you started holding her hand and of course that's no no no we talked for like 30 minutes and then she told me there she has like a list of extras so i has to look at them okay oh my god she handed you the menu no yeah she handed me the menu the menu i forgot was that the most expensive thing holding her hand i don't think hand holding is the most

1573
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,740
I actually don't know what the most expensive thing was.

1574
02:14:16,100 --> 02:14:19,000
And a couple was making out in the bathroom during the stream.

1575
02:14:19,420 --> 02:14:19,800
Oh, oh, yeah.

1576
02:14:19,860 --> 02:14:21,340
And so we went to karaoke, right?

1577
02:14:21,820 --> 02:14:27,620
And so after I went to karaoke, wait, did you have to pay her extra for her to sing that karaoke?

1578
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:28,780
No, no, no, no, no.

1579
02:14:28,920 --> 02:14:29,220
I didn't.

1580
02:14:29,440 --> 02:14:29,600
I didn't.

1581
02:14:30,200 --> 02:14:31,300
I went to the bathroom.

1582
02:14:31,620 --> 02:14:32,580
I'm so bored of this story.

1583
02:14:32,800 --> 02:14:32,900
All right.

1584
02:14:33,800 --> 02:14:34,460
Okay, I'm ready.

1585
02:14:34,720 --> 02:14:34,800
Yep.

1586
02:14:35,460 --> 02:14:35,760
All right.

1587
02:14:35,800 --> 02:14:36,540
Lock in, Emily.

1588
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:37,020
Okay.

1589
02:14:37,040 --> 02:14:39,920
I'm locked in, but like this didn't go so well at TwitchCon.

1590
02:14:40,360 --> 02:14:41,320
You got it.

1591
02:14:41,320 --> 02:14:41,880
It's okay.

1592
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:42,720
It's not Twitch cut.

1593
02:14:43,020 --> 02:14:43,160
Okay, okay.

1594
02:14:43,380 --> 02:14:44,240
You have your setup.

1595
02:14:48,440 --> 02:14:50,960
Yeah, guys, I think we know what the most expensive option was.

1596
02:14:56,060 --> 02:14:56,740
Wait, what?

1597
02:14:58,560 --> 02:14:59,960
Okay, I was gonna say it.

1598
02:15:00,300 --> 02:15:02,240
Wait, how is this the same tier?

1599
02:15:02,840 --> 02:15:02,840
Like,

1600
02:15:06,320 --> 02:15:08,340
how is it gonna be a little confused?

1601
02:15:23,650 --> 02:15:25,990
Oh my god, this is intense.

1602
02:15:28,350 --> 02:15:30,470
I think JP is definitely...

1603
02:15:30,470 --> 02:15:33,130
I was told that JP is annoying in any Elo.

1604
02:15:33,770 --> 02:15:35,970
Especially the high Elo.

1605
02:15:36,290 --> 02:15:37,470
Good JP is really annoying.

1606
02:15:37,670 --> 02:15:38,890
Wait, actually I remember.

1607
02:15:39,030 --> 02:15:40,170
Brawlpo fought against her.

1608
02:15:40,870 --> 02:15:43,450
It was so tilting for him to fight against her.

1609
02:15:44,170 --> 02:15:44,990
I remember now.

1610
02:15:52,260 --> 02:15:52,760
It's okay right?

1611
02:15:54,400 --> 02:15:54,760
close.

1612
02:15:55,380 --> 02:16:03,620
I told you guys how yellow tree fighter is like so different to watch compared to like what I had to blit.

1613
02:16:10,380 --> 02:16:11,500
Now observe.

1614
02:16:12,820 --> 02:16:16,480
Oh my god you have to like time the blocks too when they do the traps.

1615
02:16:16,660 --> 02:16:17,480
Nice, nice, nice.

1616
02:16:18,140 --> 02:16:19,020
Oh that was good.

1617
02:16:21,460 --> 02:16:24,300
A master load should stop existing.

1618
02:16:25,580 --> 02:16:44,540
Just an uninstall They just have one day where they just ban all JP players Like this is the day where JP players aren't allowed to play They should do that, you know Like days where like certain characters aren't usable Like they lock it Imagine Imagine they lock like Oh,

1619
02:16:44,800 --> 02:17:16,440
that's fine They lock certain characters for a day It's like Street Fighter is safe I swear I i swear it would it would improve the game guys it would honestly like make the player base will go up that's fine you can look for more button drivers it's like on friday we ban jp for a day yeah every day where everyone can be happy

1620
02:17:23,360 --> 02:17:27,900
go go now observe go go

1621
02:17:30,980 --> 02:17:42,940
here now observe here yes no now observe here that's so annoying i'm lagging

1622
02:17:48,240 --> 02:18:02,980
yeah i don't i could tell how annoying he is just from the voice acting too that means it's like good voice acting but it's still pretty annoying either like do your auto light yeah it's like a tick tock mpc banana she's jumping forward

1623
02:18:06,240 --> 02:18:10,480
Oh my god, you're right, JP is like the Timo, a street fighter.

1624
02:18:13,800 --> 02:18:19,380
I think he doesn't sound like, he doesn't sound like such, so snobby, I think it'd be fine.

1625
02:18:19,960 --> 02:18:21,840
Because when I do the headbutt, it doesn't sound annoying.

1626
02:18:22,080 --> 02:18:22,660
It's silly.

1627
02:18:22,960 --> 02:18:24,640
It's like, everyone cheers.

1628
02:18:26,440 --> 02:18:27,360
Everyone cheers.

1629
02:18:27,460 --> 02:18:28,840
He's like, you go, Honda!

1630
02:18:29,420 --> 02:18:30,280
You go!

1631
02:18:31,920 --> 02:18:33,280
No, don't hate him.

1632
02:18:33,300 --> 02:18:34,440
No, you don't understand, Pop!

1633
02:18:34,460 --> 02:18:34,960
with Smurf.

1634
02:18:35,860 --> 02:18:38,320
Apparently, 2XKO Timo is so annoying.

1635
02:18:40,380 --> 02:18:45,740
I read that, like, Seijam has to start the tournament one hour early because of the Timos.

1636
02:18:46,300 --> 02:18:47,560
Because it takes a lot of time.

1637
02:18:47,680 --> 02:18:49,420
Like, I don't know why, but...

1638
02:18:49,420 --> 02:18:51,920
They have to start, like, an hour early.

1639
02:18:53,160 --> 02:18:56,720
Yeah, she's also jumping when you drive us to, so I'll just look for an entire Zay, too.

1640
02:18:59,860 --> 02:19:01,120
That's just Timo.

1641
02:19:01,680 --> 02:19:02,260
Or Timo.

1642
02:19:02,660 --> 02:19:03,460
Not Timo.

1643
02:19:09,050 --> 02:19:12,750
You won't expect it a fourth time and maybe a fifth time?

1644
02:19:13,090 --> 02:19:14,250
Oh, they expected it.

1645
02:19:16,150 --> 02:19:20,670
I was going to say, there's no way she'll expect it a fifth time, guys.

1646
02:19:21,530 --> 02:19:22,790
But she did.

1647
02:19:26,190 --> 02:19:27,510
God, that is so oppressive.

1648
02:19:28,910 --> 02:19:30,430
That is actually so oppressive.

1649
02:19:37,320 --> 02:19:38,440
She's very...

1650
02:19:38,440 --> 02:19:39,140
What?

1651
02:19:39,980 --> 02:19:53,750
what this is this is so tilting the watch i understand now

1652
02:19:57,190 --> 02:20:15,550
now have you done trying to do the now observe yes now now observe someone take this old man to the retirement home see i told you guys we should We should make it so that no JP for a day.

1653
02:20:17,170 --> 02:20:21,590
And then Street Fighter would be like, wow, it's like everyone's so much happier for some reason.

1654
02:20:22,650 --> 02:20:23,210
Nice.

1655
02:20:25,770 --> 02:20:26,330
Damn.

1656
02:20:27,670 --> 02:20:28,430
That's okay.

1657
02:20:31,850 --> 02:20:32,150
No.

1658
02:20:33,430 --> 02:20:34,550
God, damn.

1659
02:20:38,540 --> 02:20:39,100
Here.

1660
02:20:40,100 --> 02:20:40,980
Now observe.

1661
02:20:42,680 --> 02:20:43,560
Oh my god, you have to blow.

1662
02:20:43,580 --> 02:20:44,640
lock all that too.

1663
02:20:44,860 --> 02:20:45,770
I think that's the worst part.

1664
02:20:49,120 --> 02:20:54,120
Burn, baby, Oh my god, what a counter.

1665
02:20:54,820 --> 02:20:54,820
Yeah!

1666
02:20:54,920 --> 02:20:58,200
Anytime you get closer, just watch out for the heavy punch.

1667
02:20:58,660 --> 02:21:01,280
Please stop praying for my grandfather.

1668
02:21:09,020 --> 02:21:11,480
Oh, how did she expect that?

1669
02:21:14,880 --> 02:21:15,500
Go!

1670
02:21:20,070 --> 02:21:21,490
Oh my I got the jabs.

1671
02:21:24,390 --> 02:21:26,910
In fact, I have three more games after this too.

1672
02:21:29,290 --> 02:21:31,410
I'm so like, oh god.

1673
02:21:32,710 --> 02:21:34,810
Not ready for it.

1674
02:21:42,210 --> 02:21:44,050
I was like, what's the gas for?

1675
02:21:44,310 --> 02:21:45,050
Am I behind?

1676
02:21:47,650 --> 02:21:48,590
Oh no.

1677
02:21:49,110 --> 02:21:51,710
No, I'm not because like we were like nice when she won.

1678
02:21:51,770 --> 02:21:52,850
Oh my god, I can't do it.

1679
02:21:56,310 --> 02:21:56,890
No.

1680
02:21:57,730 --> 02:21:58,650
Now observe.

1681
02:22:00,050 --> 02:22:02,070
I can predict her next move.

1682
02:22:02,550 --> 02:22:02,550
No.

1683
02:22:03,050 --> 02:22:03,430
Now observe.

1684
02:22:04,270 --> 02:22:07,070
It's like I know what her next move is gonna be.

1685
02:22:09,770 --> 02:22:10,550
Now observe.

1686
02:22:13,390 --> 02:22:13,450
Oh.

1687
02:22:14,650 --> 02:22:15,230
Stop.

1688
02:22:16,570 --> 02:22:17,790
Oh, he can't do it.

1689
02:22:17,830 --> 02:22:18,730
He can't do observe.

1690
02:22:18,950 --> 02:22:20,070
He doesn't have his magic.

1691
02:22:20,330 --> 02:22:20,750
Oh my god.

1692
02:22:22,690 --> 02:22:23,210
Oh no.

1693
02:22:24,030 --> 02:22:24,510
Oh.

1694
02:22:24,610 --> 02:22:25,050
Oh.

1695
02:22:28,930 --> 02:22:31,430
I'm glad I didn't try and play JP.

1696
02:22:32,590 --> 02:22:36,830
My brain does not have enough space for this.

1697
02:22:39,090 --> 02:22:40,130
Now observe.

1698
02:22:42,090 --> 02:22:43,870
Oh, how do you block that?

1699
02:22:44,390 --> 02:22:45,170
Was it timing?

1700
02:22:45,930 --> 02:22:46,910
Is she just got timed?

1701
02:22:48,290 --> 02:22:48,610
Yeah.

1702
02:22:49,370 --> 02:22:49,670
Okay.

1703
02:22:50,550 --> 02:22:51,610
Bro, how do you get close?

1704
02:22:51,870 --> 02:22:52,210
How?

1705
02:22:52,510 --> 02:22:53,110
How do you...

1706
02:22:53,110 --> 02:22:54,530
How do you...

1707
02:22:54,530 --> 02:22:55,470
How do you get there?

1708
02:22:57,910 --> 02:23:02,610
Bro, it's like she owns 20 meters square of the territory.

1709
02:23:03,390 --> 02:23:06,330
Oh, she has to jump?

1710
02:23:07,150 --> 02:23:07,870
Like, how?

1711
02:23:09,950 --> 02:23:10,210
Bro!

1712
02:23:12,090 --> 02:23:13,290
Now observe.

1713
02:23:14,070 --> 02:23:14,710
Oh, my God.

1714
02:23:14,750 --> 02:23:17,090
Oh, does she still have the magic?

1715
02:23:17,510 --> 02:23:19,210
Bro, you can just spam this!

1716
02:23:20,670 --> 02:23:21,810
Be patient.

1717
02:23:24,810 --> 02:23:26,010
Bro, I...

1718
02:23:27,290 --> 02:23:29,450
I can't play against this thing.

1719
02:23:30,190 --> 02:23:31,670
It's like a rhythm game.

1720
02:23:31,950 --> 02:23:32,430
Yeah, that was close.

1721
02:23:32,870 --> 02:23:36,970
Yeah, you had one, the one game series you won, you played it really well.

1722
02:23:37,370 --> 02:23:38,670
Yeah, you did, and it was really good.

1723
02:23:40,870 --> 02:23:42,190
You should retire this character.

1724
02:23:42,650 --> 02:23:44,630
I don't think it adds any value to Street Fighter.

1725
02:23:44,950 --> 02:23:46,010
I don't think it would have.

1726
02:23:47,230 --> 02:23:51,050
That character should be retired, taken to a home.

1727
02:23:52,370 --> 02:23:53,610
And so they've already ungodless.

1728
02:23:54,690 --> 02:24:17,670
I'm going to reread the, so how how is jp not the evo champ yeah it's mostly he's gonna ex headbutt on wake up so you can either grab him or shimmy and jab him jab him grab him grab him grab him like i'll grab put the sleep guys i think he's getting old or he must eventually die of old age right

1729
02:24:23,480 --> 02:24:51,180
okay like how is he not like how is like uh fighter in the street evo and capcon cup um how is he not like forever the champion uh uh he joined i i actually i joined solo training by accident and then he did he won last capcon cup why didn't he get nerfed again don't they nerf characters that win the Capcom Cup?

1730
02:24:53,220 --> 02:24:54,560
I don't understand.

1731
02:24:58,520 --> 02:25:01,260
They should nerf every character that wins the Capcom Cup.

1732
02:25:01,920 --> 02:25:03,180
Alright, here we go.

1733
02:25:06,540 --> 02:25:08,260
No, they nerfed it.

1734
02:25:10,700 --> 02:25:15,960
How did Geep get nerfed, but this old man is still alive in my game?

1735
02:25:18,480 --> 02:25:22,860
Honestly, just give him one move oh that's me wait i'm gonna

1736
02:25:28,000 --> 02:26:03,850
i'm i see no one knows what to do no one does no i use half those moves except for the dash bro he's see he's using the head foot it's me nice nice oh oh yeah i think maybe more fireballs i have to start so you can't i know how they feel

1737
02:26:11,370 --> 02:26:51,430
help i don't know how what do you mean i don't know what to do what do you mean help him i'm not i'm if any thing i will not be helpful at all wait that's not fair this team has a honda player like they could just they could actually get additional coaching nice all right i don't have an aki player that give me additional coaching with fireball at the beginning yeah you could try like no they have a Honda player to coach it.

1738
02:26:54,850 --> 02:26:55,570
That's me.

1739
02:26:59,580 --> 02:27:00,980
They'll never expect.

1740
02:27:04,700 --> 02:27:04,840
Oh.

1741
02:27:12,520 --> 02:27:13,040
Okay.

1742
02:27:15,540 --> 02:27:18,220
I mean, they're doing the dashes.

1743
02:27:18,340 --> 02:27:20,340
I'm like, I don't know how to do the dashes correctly.

1744
02:27:21,120 --> 02:27:23,300
So I do the super headbutt, guys.

1745
02:27:24,660 --> 02:27:25,680
Oh, wait, burnout's good.

1746
02:27:26,300 --> 02:27:27,720
Burnout is so good for him.

1747
02:27:30,700 --> 02:28:24,660
that's fine oh unlucky no abuse that burnout that's what i always do oh it's the butt slam what the heck was that move oh that's bad oh i think on defense you can try like dp or something no it's not you mean dp it is good for me no no like um yeah just like our wake up like exdp or oh exdp and then you said super on wake up yeah level one is good because it's side switches too okay it's just funny watching another honda play because i'm like i think i'm just getting hit by like a lot of them but so like yeah yeah i mean he's really patient so yeah i'll just throw a fire because i don't want to get jump in on so i think i can maintain a little bit more space then if anything i think we'll be like We'll be in the semis,

1748
02:28:24,920 --> 02:28:25,440
if anything.

1749
02:28:26,600 --> 02:28:27,200
I don't think we're...

1750
02:28:27,200 --> 02:28:27,620
I don't know.

1751
02:28:27,800 --> 02:28:30,560
I think we have to adapt for the finals, but...

1752
02:28:32,320 --> 02:28:33,160
That's not fair.

1753
02:28:33,300 --> 02:28:35,040
The Hanna has, like, six moves.

1754
02:28:35,160 --> 02:28:35,900
Yeah, I know, right?

1755
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:44,760
I just thought it was funny watching it.

1756
02:28:44,860 --> 02:28:45,340
Oh, wait.

1757
02:28:46,480 --> 02:28:47,920
Sorry, I forgot that they started.

1758
02:28:48,700 --> 02:28:50,380
I forgot I got kicked out.

1759
02:28:51,560 --> 02:28:52,780
All right, we're gonna watch Dragon Ball Z.

1760
02:28:52,980 --> 02:28:53,580
Watch this.

1761
02:28:53,700 --> 02:28:54,700
You gotta do this.

1762
02:28:55,020 --> 02:28:55,500
Come on.

1763
02:28:56,320 --> 02:28:57,720
I'm number one.

1764
02:28:59,960 --> 02:29:00,680
game

1765
02:29:04,940 --> 02:29:11,720
okay we're here now we're here we're speed no next game is the 20 point game

1766
02:29:17,110 --> 02:29:51,570
nice enough i think so okay we're back now yeah keep it up I hope Proudhon wins this because if we win the 20 point game I mean I actually called it out if we win the 20 point game then I don't have to win the Aki matchup I'm just scared about that I don't want them to relax that's why I don't want to be last I already be first

1767
02:29:58,820 --> 02:30:01,700
oh my god No, I was like, what?

1768
02:30:03,040 --> 02:30:04,080
We're headbutt.

1769
02:30:05,660 --> 02:30:06,400
Oh, that's bad.

1770
02:30:07,600 --> 02:30:08,020
Oh, nice.

1771
02:30:08,140 --> 02:30:08,720
That's a good count.

1772
02:30:08,980 --> 02:30:11,180
Oh, bro.

1773
02:30:11,300 --> 02:30:12,740
He does the butt slam so...

1774
02:30:12,740 --> 02:30:13,660
Yeah, the Genroids are doing good, though.

1775
02:30:13,840 --> 02:30:16,140
So you can keep doing them until he stops at once.

1776
02:30:25,490 --> 02:30:27,130
What does that move?

1777
02:30:28,830 --> 02:30:30,670
Never seen that move before.

1778
02:30:38,170 --> 02:30:38,690
Jeez.

1779
02:30:40,510 --> 02:30:41,370
Oh, my God.

1780
02:30:41,390 --> 02:30:42,250
Oh, no.

1781
02:30:42,610 --> 02:30:43,410
Let me try this one.

1782
02:30:44,190 --> 02:30:44,630
Oh, man.

1783
02:30:45,170 --> 02:30:45,670
Let's try.

1784
02:30:46,310 --> 02:30:47,150
Oh, Honda.

1785
02:30:47,650 --> 02:30:47,790
Okay.

1786
02:30:48,530 --> 02:30:48,910
Nice try.

1787
02:30:49,130 --> 02:30:49,490
Nice try.

1788
02:30:49,610 --> 02:30:51,850
You just use the headbutt too much.

1789
02:30:54,030 --> 02:30:56,590
Wait, the headbutts are really effective even.

1790
02:30:56,810 --> 02:30:57,590
They are.

1791
02:30:58,030 --> 02:30:58,790
I told you.

1792
02:30:59,290 --> 02:31:00,670
Why else do I spam it?

1793
02:31:00,730 --> 02:31:02,110
It's about the like the rhythm as well.

1794
02:31:04,770 --> 02:31:06,430
Oh, don't say that.

1795
02:31:07,210 --> 02:31:08,890
Because Feisty clutches these.

1796
02:31:09,030 --> 02:31:10,650
Guys, don't say that.

1797
02:31:10,670 --> 02:31:10,990
Yeah.

1798
02:31:12,050 --> 02:31:13,310
I will try.

1799
02:31:13,710 --> 02:31:14,350
I don't even know.

1800
02:31:14,450 --> 02:31:15,770
Can we start yet?

1801
02:31:17,050 --> 02:31:18,050
Oh, no.

1802
02:31:18,510 --> 02:31:20,110
I wish I was first.

1803
02:31:20,870 --> 02:31:22,790
I wish I was first.

1804
02:31:24,210 --> 02:31:25,710
In the off-stream match.

1805
02:31:25,970 --> 02:31:27,770
That's why we're first and second.

1806
02:31:28,330 --> 02:31:29,270
I told you we're on-stream.

1807
02:31:30,010 --> 02:31:30,430
No, we're off-stream.

1808
02:31:30,510 --> 02:31:30,630
No, no, no.

1809
02:31:30,810 --> 02:31:32,310
Our first game was on-stream.

1810
02:31:33,330 --> 02:31:33,570
Okay.

1811
02:31:36,190 --> 02:31:36,750
Oh.

1812
02:31:39,410 --> 02:31:40,430
It's, yeah.

1813
02:31:41,390 --> 02:31:42,010
All right.

1814
02:31:42,250 --> 02:31:43,390
We do not see the pressure.

1815
02:31:43,570 --> 02:31:44,950
We do not see it, guys.

1816
02:31:46,630 --> 02:31:47,690
Yes, it's okay.

1817
02:31:58,080 --> 02:31:58,580
Oh.

1818
02:32:00,960 --> 02:32:02,120
There we go.

1819
02:32:12,140 --> 02:32:13,800
Oh my gosh, another Akuma too.

1820
02:32:14,980 --> 02:32:16,620
What the heck, Grandmaster?

1821
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,300
How did Dom get this team?

1822
02:32:22,720 --> 02:32:24,780
Bro, it was drafted.

1823
02:32:25,260 --> 02:32:27,060
Was he, was he like first?

1824
02:32:27,080 --> 02:32:35,920
strap and he picked like oh sorry bison sorry i meant bison uh they both are like old and dying

1825
02:32:42,460 --> 02:32:50,190
nice never mind never mind never mind feisty's better feisty's better

1826
02:32:59,370 --> 02:33:01,270
I didn't see the points.

1827
02:33:01,410 --> 02:33:03,430
I just saw high master versus grand master.

1828
02:33:03,630 --> 02:33:08,210
So I didn't wasn't pay attention to the point system Never mind, but I see it so much better

1829
02:33:13,750 --> 02:33:15,830
Jesus, oh Oh

1830
02:33:21,230 --> 02:33:24,350
my god what what is going on?

1831
02:33:26,370 --> 02:33:27,710
What am I looking at?

1832
02:33:28,790 --> 02:33:31,550
This land so hard

1833
02:33:46,500 --> 02:33:53,490
oh my god please fight back nice

1834
02:33:56,990 --> 02:34:08,770
but i'm like heart beating for her am i dead i don't think so like my heart's beating for her and i'm not playing oh she's dead

1835
02:34:16,430 --> 02:34:17,430
jumping at him more.

1836
02:34:19,550 --> 02:34:20,570
At least from far, I think.

1837
02:34:28,060 --> 02:34:28,540
Oh my gosh.

1838
02:34:28,860 --> 02:34:31,840
Oh, that's good.

1839
02:34:34,600 --> 02:34:34,820
Oh my god.

1840
02:34:34,900 --> 02:34:37,620
Oh my god, I forgot to watch like, uh, best of five.

1841
02:34:46,030 --> 02:34:48,790
People downloading the game we're talking about.

1842
02:34:50,670 --> 02:34:57,910
adapting and downloading the plays no we play the same until it works

1843
02:35:07,040 --> 02:35:33,460
okay oh oh i think the hard part is that because there's two bison players watch out for the driver reversal on his wake up oh there's two bison players but i think both of them play differently too so she has to adapt to two different play styles for bison i assume right yeah and keep keep probably kicking him because i think he's catching his like pecs yeah yeah or back dash i think trying to back dash

1844
02:35:36,780 --> 02:35:39,720
so what does the music do guys

1845
02:35:43,040 --> 02:36:06,880
oh my god nice looking good looking good oh got this i'm cooking i'm cooking i understand more damage oh speed buff like just beat or does she do more damage too oh my god my heavy kick didn't come out it's okay oh and deals more damage oh okay that's so broken if she when she gets her alt

1846
02:36:10,340 --> 02:36:11,800
that seems so broken

1847
02:36:18,550 --> 02:36:35,750
oh mexican yeah we can do it after the stream after the stream or not after the stream i just think to myself i mean after the games after the games just uh if chat can remind me Like, I just synonymize the cell.

1848
02:36:37,750 --> 02:36:38,910
It's like, don't worry, guys.

1849
02:36:39,110 --> 02:36:39,370
I can't.

1850
02:36:42,910 --> 02:36:45,370
But if you guys can remind me after the tournament.

1851
02:36:51,550 --> 02:36:51,570
Oh.

1852
02:36:52,030 --> 02:36:53,010
Oh, nice.

1853
02:36:53,770 --> 02:36:54,270
Oh, my God.

1854
02:36:54,350 --> 02:36:55,590
When does this combo end?

1855
02:36:57,790 --> 02:37:00,250
Oh, this is scary.

1856
02:37:01,550 --> 02:37:03,530
Technically, Bison has one hit.

1857
02:37:03,930 --> 02:37:04,630
Oh, nice.

1858
02:37:04,850 --> 02:37:18,330

1859
02:37:22,390 --> 02:37:31,130
i think the hard part is like street fighters literally like you're playing chess it's like it's like hardcore chess extreme chess

1860
02:37:42,780 --> 02:37:45,700
Jesus, this is so fast paced, dude.

1861
02:37:46,820 --> 02:37:47,380
Oh, no.

1862
02:37:53,080 --> 02:37:54,420
Oh, nice.

1863
02:37:57,300 --> 02:37:57,800
Oh.

1864
02:37:59,280 --> 02:38:00,460
Oh, no.

1865
02:38:01,580 --> 02:38:02,320
Oh, no.

1866
02:38:02,640 --> 02:38:03,180
Don't worry.

1867
02:38:05,060 --> 02:38:07,280
Oh, what?

1868
02:38:07,480 --> 02:38:08,380
That hit?

1869
02:38:09,320 --> 02:38:11,040
She was so far.

1870
02:38:14,700 --> 02:38:16,480
She was so far.

1871
02:38:19,060 --> 02:38:19,540
Yeah.

1872
02:38:22,340 --> 02:38:23,960
I expect that to hit.

1873
02:38:25,720 --> 02:38:27,420
She was so far from the corner.

1874
02:38:29,120 --> 02:38:29,920
That was an accident.

1875
02:38:30,140 --> 02:38:31,020
I don't know what I'm doing.

1876
02:38:31,480 --> 02:38:32,460
That was a good frame tag.

1877
02:38:33,240 --> 02:38:35,000
You can try to show me over something here.

1878
02:38:35,520 --> 02:38:35,760
Okay.

1879
02:38:41,480 --> 02:38:42,180
Oh no.

1880
02:38:44,260 --> 02:38:46,360
At least the music's nice.

1881
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:51,000
Oh, what a parry.

1882
02:38:54,160 --> 02:38:57,600
Her damage, I just realized her damage isn't, like, that high, though.

1883
02:38:58,900 --> 02:39:00,460
Oh, she waited for her.

1884
02:39:07,600 --> 02:39:07,820
Jesus.

1885
02:39:08,780 --> 02:39:09,360
Oh, my God.

1886
02:39:10,300 --> 02:39:10,500
Okay.

1887
02:39:11,260 --> 02:39:11,700
Oh, nice.

1888
02:39:12,080 --> 02:39:12,360
I controlled her.

1889
02:39:12,920 --> 02:39:15,200
Oh, was it 2-1?

1890
02:39:15,380 --> 02:39:16,740
And you controlled her so bad.

1891
02:39:17,560 --> 02:39:21,260
Yeah, her damage is really But she's so fast though

1892
02:39:27,520 --> 02:39:34,760
Yeah, because I was like bro she did so much like I saw so many moves But he's barely like she barely did any damage.

1893
02:39:34,960 --> 02:39:35,680
I was so confused

1894
02:39:42,500 --> 02:39:49,280
Oh I mean they're both burn up

1895
02:39:53,710 --> 02:40:02,410
Yeah, she needs to use like every move possible Oh my god Is this...

1896
02:40:04,310 --> 02:40:05,350
I knew he was gonna do it again.

1897
02:40:05,750 --> 02:40:08,010
Too thirsty for it?

1898
02:40:17,850 --> 02:40:18,610
Okay.

1899
02:40:23,280 --> 02:40:25,680
Oh, she blocked it.

1900
02:40:30,380 --> 02:40:32,080
Level 3, I don't care.

1901
02:40:32,300 --> 02:40:32,820
I'm cooking!

1902
02:40:34,060 --> 02:40:34,700
I'm cooking!

1903
02:40:36,020 --> 02:40:36,800
He's cooking!

1904
02:40:44,830 --> 02:40:46,610
Oh my god, he's just blocking.

1905
02:40:47,670 --> 02:40:50,010
What is this blocking game I'm watching?

1906
02:40:50,110 --> 02:40:50,650
There we go.

1907
02:40:50,770 --> 02:40:51,150

02:40:52,390 --> 02:40:54,170
No, but also, yay!

That is incredible.

1910
02:40:56,070 --> 02:40:56,710
Nice job.

1911
02:40:57,130 --> 02:40:57,230
Nice job.

1912
02:40:58,810 --> 02:41:02,390
Oh my god, but also don't, because I'm the last game.

1913
02:41:02,830 --> 02:41:03,890
You got it.

1914
02:41:04,170 --> 02:41:04,490
All right.

1915
02:41:05,130 --> 02:41:07,330
Oh god.

1916
02:41:08,310 --> 02:41:08,930
Oh god.

1917
02:41:09,150 --> 02:41:10,230
You got a dokey.

Let's go.

1919
02:41:13,650 --> 02:41:14,490
It's okay.

1920
02:41:14,890 --> 02:41:16,910
In the end, we fight them again anyway.

1921
02:41:17,970 --> 02:41:20,730
Doesn't matter where we're at, we still fight them again.

1922
02:41:22,750 --> 02:41:35,490
you know if i see if you're looking for a new controller i know someone who wants to rent a girlfriend and no you know what that would be great man yeah i got you

1926
02:42:39,500 --> 02:42:40,620

02:42:44,180 --> 02:42:44,560
Oh, wait, guys.

1928
02:42:44,760 --> 02:42:45,460
She has been watching.

1929
02:42:49,660 --> 02:42:51,880
That move you can do your heavy auto damage.

1930
02:42:52,340 --> 02:42:53,460
The one where she goes up.

1931
02:42:53,600 --> 02:42:53,820
Yeah.

1932
02:42:56,880 --> 02:42:58,320
They keep doing that.

1933
02:42:59,920 --> 02:43:00,880
Oh, okay.

1934
02:43:05,340 --> 02:43:06,100
You want to play patient.

1935
02:43:06,560 --> 02:43:07,880
Your Kaden's going to come back soon.

1936
02:43:08,260 --> 02:43:08,440
Oh.

1937
02:43:14,320 --> 02:43:14,860
Nice.

1938
02:43:19,510 --> 02:43:22,190
Oh, I didn't expect that.

1939
02:43:24,030 --> 02:43:24,170
Oh!

1940
02:43:25,210 --> 02:43:25,990
That's fine.

1941
02:43:27,110 --> 02:43:28,210
Okay, there you go.

1942
02:43:28,830 --> 02:43:29,310
Nice, nice, nice.

1943
02:43:29,850 --> 02:43:31,530
Yeah, that heavy auto combo I think is really good.

1944
02:43:32,270 --> 02:43:32,470
Okay.

1945
02:43:51,100 --> 02:43:52,260
Oh, unlucky.

1946
02:44:02,040 --> 02:44:02,580
Nice.

1947
02:44:03,080 --> 02:44:03,440
Nice.

1948
02:44:03,440 --> 02:44:04,240
Oh.

1949
02:44:06,540 --> 02:44:07,140
Oh no.

1950
02:44:08,600 --> 02:44:09,280
What's that?

1951
02:44:09,420 --> 02:44:10,500
That she makes you block.

1952
02:44:13,820 --> 02:44:14,340
Oh.

1953
02:44:15,340 --> 02:44:17,620
Oh, okay.

1954
02:44:18,480 --> 02:44:20,200
Yeah, don't do EX HUD Buzzkill Fireballs.

1955
02:44:20,540 --> 02:44:21,400
Do your butt slams.

1956
02:44:22,680 --> 02:44:23,280
No, what's that?

1957
02:44:24,140 --> 02:44:24,700
Oh, butt slam.

1958
02:44:30,550 --> 02:44:31,010
Nice.

1959
02:44:44,380 --> 02:44:44,980
Nice.

1960
02:44:45,440 --> 02:44:46,020
Nice.

1961
02:44:46,020 --> 02:44:46,320
Nice.

1962
02:44:49,160 --> 02:44:49,760
Nice.

1963
02:44:49,760 --> 02:44:49,880
Nice.

1964
02:44:50,680 --> 02:44:51,200
Oh,

1965
02:44:58,120 --> 02:44:58,240
no.

1966
02:44:59,040 --> 02:45:00,200
I think she was going to do that.

1967
02:45:03,320 --> 02:45:03,680
Oh, no.

1968
02:45:04,880 --> 02:45:06,640
Okay, you saw a little more.

1969
02:45:12,620 --> 02:45:13,260
Nice, nice, nice.

1970
02:45:14,080 --> 02:45:14,720
Looking good.

1971
02:45:14,960 --> 02:45:15,240
Looking good.

1972
02:45:15,480 --> 02:45:15,800
Keep it up.

1973
02:45:16,060 --> 02:45:16,580
Looking amazing.

1974
02:45:16,860 --> 02:45:17,140
Okay.

1975
02:45:17,320 --> 02:45:18,040
They locked in.

1976
02:45:18,100 --> 02:45:18,620
You got it.

1977
02:45:22,870 --> 02:45:23,390
Okay.

1978
02:45:24,030 --> 02:45:24,690
That's fine.

1979
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:41,700
I don't like that she adapts to me.

1980
02:45:42,840 --> 02:45:43,580
That should be illegal.

1981
02:46:03,500 --> 02:46:04,180
Oh, my God.

1982
02:46:05,300 --> 02:46:05,800
I know she...

1983
02:46:05,800 --> 02:46:06,800
You can try Deioning her, too.

1984
02:46:07,680 --> 02:46:07,760
Oh.

1985
02:46:09,160 --> 02:46:09,520
Nephew!

1986
02:46:12,860 --> 02:46:13,220
Okay.

1987
02:46:19,060 --> 02:46:19,420
Nice.

1988
02:46:20,540 --> 02:46:21,760
That's not going to work out for you.

1989
02:46:21,780 --> 02:46:24,880
I did it when you told me that.

1990
02:46:26,820 --> 02:46:27,020
Nice.

1991
02:46:29,020 --> 02:46:31,280
Yeah, anytime you feel confident, you do the best land.

1992
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:36,500
Wait, I get this!

1993
02:46:37,040 --> 02:46:37,700
Yeah, you got it.

1994
02:46:38,520 --> 02:46:40,060
I just made it in time.

1995
02:46:41,280 --> 02:46:43,120
You could try and go up for the grab, maybe.

1996
02:46:43,620 --> 02:46:44,000
The grab?

1997
02:46:44,120 --> 02:46:44,340
Okay.

1998
02:46:44,900 --> 02:46:46,220
Like the down special?

1999
02:46:48,940 --> 02:46:51,500
Oh, oh, I was gonna grab, but it didn't let me.

2000
02:46:51,780 --> 02:46:53,780
That's fine.

2001
02:46:55,560 --> 02:46:56,560
Also, she cannot.

2002
02:46:57,220 --> 02:46:59,280
Yeah, but slam for sure.

2003
02:46:59,480 --> 02:47:00,260
She can't anti-Ary.

2004
02:47:08,780 --> 02:47:09,460
Yeah, we did it!

2005
02:47:09,880 --> 02:47:10,740
We won!

2006
02:47:11,660 --> 02:47:12,920
We did it!

2007
02:47:13,060 --> 02:47:14,160
We did it!

2008
02:47:14,400 --> 02:47:14,400
We did it!

2009
02:47:14,640 --> 02:47:15,900
We're in the finals!

2010
02:47:16,200 --> 02:47:16,800
Let's get him!

2011
02:47:16,860 --> 02:47:17,360
No way, no way!

2012
02:47:17,500 --> 02:47:18,320
We're in the finals!

2013
02:47:21,300 --> 02:47:22,060
Wait, hold on.

2014
02:47:22,180 --> 02:47:23,500
We're automatic grand finals!

2015
02:47:23,580 --> 02:47:26,740
We don't need a year to practice Honda!

2016
02:47:29,280 --> 02:47:30,920
I just need a year.

2017
02:47:31,060 --> 02:47:32,920
I need three days and that's it.

2018
02:47:32,920 --> 02:47:33,640
Oh my God.

2019
02:47:33,800 --> 02:47:34,440
You're amazing.

2020
02:47:34,900 --> 02:47:36,580
You're literally crazy, dude.

2021
02:47:36,920 --> 02:47:38,160
Oh my God.

2022
02:47:38,680 --> 02:47:39,500
Oh my God.

2023
02:47:39,900 --> 02:47:40,360
We're in the files.

2024
02:47:40,360 --> 02:47:41,800
I think we're in the files, right?

2025
02:47:42,660 --> 02:47:43,200
Yeah.

2026
02:47:43,740 --> 02:47:44,900
We're home.

2027
02:47:45,840 --> 02:47:47,200
We can just chill.

2028
02:47:47,560 --> 02:47:48,300
You know, we're home.

2029
02:47:49,080 --> 02:47:49,300
Yeah.

2030
02:47:49,760 --> 02:47:50,320
Let's go.

2031
02:47:51,340 --> 02:47:52,220
No way.

2032
02:47:52,940 --> 02:47:53,600
You have to carry.

2033
02:47:54,200 --> 02:47:55,060
Oh my God.

2034
02:47:55,160 --> 02:47:56,280
No, you carry, Doki.

2035
02:47:56,600 --> 02:47:58,020
No, you carry too.

2036
02:47:58,040 --> 02:49:15,080
bro that matchup you did two 20 pointer games oh my god i was stressed out during it too man we were all stressed up but we're in the grand finals baby we are dude no matter what we can get first or second yeah so like do we just wait how long do we how long do we wait for it i think we literally have to wait for both of their matches oh yeah it might take a couple yeah we got time oh i'm just gonna do a wrap for that oh well our match is the last match yeah so whenever we play that's it oh so they're gonna play 10 i think i'm gonna yeah i don't really understand how this works but it's gonna be at least what two matches yeah yeah i think it's at least like two hours before you play probably oh no wait two hours no i end stream here I'll be back here guys grabbing dinner I'll be right back JK guys I'm not ending stream it's probably like 1.5 hours but it could be like 2 hours if there are any delays that's true because we have to wait for every match yeah I need to play some game yeah

2037
02:49:15,080 --> 02:50:22,840
I probably should I gotta take a break though like from playing yeah if you're hungry you should probably eat now you know what I mean I'm hungry but I feel like I probably play better hungry oh yeah you makes you want it more you know yeah you're like i'll i'll only eat if i win wait that's crazy because if yeah okay oh my god oh i'm so happy guys i i'm gonna chill max i'm not gonna play for i'll play when the second gate like uh because there's two there's gonna be two matches uh full matches i'll start warming up during the second match i don't want get uh too exhausted you know uh from if i play if i play too much i i actually just brain off like i feel like that team is really strong so i i expect to meet them yeah no i think yeah i think they're definitely the strongest team and then the finals what is it first to 50 is that what they said i don't even understand it's the same thing i think it's the same matchup but it's just whoever gets the 50.

2038
02:50:23,080 --> 02:50:45,980
so we get to choose the seating okay okay i don't know want to be last why not i mean actually i don't think you should be third then no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no i think doki should be first or second because like we can get points easy that way yeah definitely win and then if i win we already have 30.

2039
02:50:46,460 --> 02:51:58,060
yeah exactly i'll take the first or second i mean we don't know who's gonna be in the final but most i'm pretty sure it's this team because they've like they had we they had the same stacks as us until they fought us yeah oh they just have like two of their tiers are just too good like fumi is definitely the best in her tier i think she's the only master in her tier everyone else is diamond and then sarotina is yeah i thought yeah yeah sarotina is the best in her bracket i think it's just i abused the head but like i just know you're better that's what it is you're better but she has the most experience too so it was like it was scary yeah she definitely has the most experience so it's two really good tears that they have so it's just tough oh my god yeah tough but not unbeatable i believe in us guys we're going to japan if not if not then we almost went to japan it's okay man i'm proud of us either way we were and everyone worked so hard yeah every point matter right like i said i

2040
02:51:58,060 --> 02:52:36,780
started playing on tuesday but yeah nah but you worked really hard though i feel like you definitely worked way harder than the other new people uh oh my god it's either we almost made it to japan or we're going to japan it's one or the other you picked a good character honestly oh yeah no i told nephew i was like i want the easy way easiest way to win i don't care damn nephew said hondo right away didn't even think about it yep yeah i mean he's the best choice man yeah you're right for sure

2041
02:52:39,920 --> 02:52:49,040
the one they're playing on stream right now it's already like the bracket right no oh no it's not it's not but they're gonna that means they're gonna play each other again

2042
02:52:53,400 --> 02:53:22,900
it doesn't who has to play each other is both of them right they're gonna play right after this again yeah they play each other right after again yeah yeah it's probably gonna be a while they're definitely going on a break oh my god at least two breaks i'm guys i'm just happy i'm happy we made it to the grand finals you know i had like very low expectations for myself so i'm just happy that um like i got there whatever win or lose i'm happy we got to at least second place

2043
02:53:26,540 --> 02:53:53,320
that's it yeah oh I'm happy I just have to play one the best part guys I just got to play one game after I don't even guys I will have you guys know I don't even know what happened that game I had against the Aki I don't know what I did I don't even know what I did in that game I already forgot like my minus blanked out in that entire tournament.

2044
02:53:53,640 --> 02:54:00,100
Like, I don't, I dipped to the Ryu and the jury, but I legitimately don't know how I won that game against the Aki.

2045
02:54:00,560 --> 02:54:04,380
I, I, you locked it.

2046
02:54:04,520 --> 02:54:07,560
I locked it so hard that I forgot what happened.

2047
02:54:11,280 --> 02:54:11,560
Yeah.

2048
02:54:11,800 --> 02:54:13,620
I told you guys, Bruno is good.

2049
02:54:13,680 --> 02:54:17,620
Did you not see what I did during Bruno?

2050
02:54:19,400 --> 02:54:21,480
I literally got so many.

2051
02:54:21,500 --> 02:54:26,300
any free hits from having being burnt out

2052
02:54:31,100 --> 02:54:33,500
look at all the heavy attacks that I got

2053
02:54:37,200 --> 02:55:25,910
oh yeah no one yeah no one expects the burnout you know like okay when people get burned out you would think that they would try and run away you know I didn't I didn't run away I went full in I knew the risk and I was willing to gamble it all away that's right I gambled the risk you get stronger with burnout exactly yeah burnout only motivates me proceeds to walk forward yeah

2054
02:55:29,100 --> 02:55:35,800
don't leak okay it's not because I've been literally doing that for my entire game.

2055
02:55:40,900 --> 02:55:42,900
That's been on the two.

2056
02:55:47,260 --> 02:55:48,940
I'm just happy, honestly.

2057
02:55:50,920 --> 02:55:52,460
I'm happy that...

2058
02:55:52,460 --> 02:55:53,340
I was so scared.

2059
02:55:53,480 --> 02:55:54,500
She was the...

2060
02:55:54,500 --> 02:55:55,360
Like, Seraphine was good.

2061
02:55:55,540 --> 02:56:03,720
So, like, because, like, she was the one that made me the most scared during Sage I'm Slam because I was so used to playing Pass.

2062
02:56:03,800 --> 02:56:37,340
Like, I was so used to playing super aggressive on Zanke if I remember and so like she made me so scared um playing against her during when we were both in beginner tier for the Zanke versus Aki and then from that's why like and then she kept playing you know what I did I uninstalled I she was much strong she kept playing and then she did the next stage I'm slam too I think right she did the because like she was in the second sea jam slam as well right after um yeah

2063
02:56:40,780 --> 02:57:59,640
and i came back i came back here oh yeah we'll do the birthday song now we have we can do it now oh but thank you everybody for all the memberships and um for all the members the super chats and everything and the follows i really appreciate it guys i'm literally slouched on my chair right now uh-uh that's how our last night am um yeah i played everyone was playing street fighter i played marvel i told you the marvel rivals helped me figure out the cooldowns guys it the the marvel rivals helped guys um l thank you for the super chat thank you thank you adoki it's me oh yeah um anyway next thing i'll hear your birthday song happy birthday to you birthday to you happy birthday dear mexican happy birthday to you yeah happy birthday yeah they're cool down chain um because i've only played it i don't get two sessions like off stream where i played rink um i think like i don't know i retained the information a lot better on honda um for uh i think it's just like and even though it was like a

2064
02:57:59,640 --> 02:58:00,920
year ago i definitely did.

2065
02:58:01,940 --> 02:58:05,940
Uh, I thought I wouldn't remember what was going on, but I remembered.

2066
02:58:08,520 --> 02:58:10,960
It took me a while to remember.

2067
02:58:11,540 --> 02:58:12,780
It really did.

2068
02:58:14,200 --> 02:58:18,720
Uh, but like, I'm glad.

2069
02:58:18,900 --> 02:58:22,360
I'm glad I did as well as I did.

2070
02:58:23,620 --> 02:58:55,980
Um, uh yeah i sort i i guess i sort of remember recovered the muscle memory but like it's so different like zangif and honda are two very different characters zangif like the play style is so different i don't think it's same i feel like i was learning the only thing like i retain is just like where to press my butt like the auto so the muscle memory was the auto attack and um that's it

2071
02:58:59,140 --> 02:59:56,480
that's it everything else was like different for me so I don't like you were like oh it's just because you played Zane Geef so the knowledge transferred over but legitimately all the moves I did on Zane Geef is so different from what I had to do on Honda so it was like learning the new characters to help again but I also had two amazing coaches I had Nephew and Big Bird helping me out though like back to back so that like that helped out a lot as well um oh that actually helped out a lot uh well thank you super chat thank you thank you my birthday is today too glad you locked in a one you're at least one game for the training yeah i did it now i can oh my gosh now i can chill until one hour before uh one hour before the or uh i'll go in one hour for the match to warm up.

2072
02:59:57,200 --> 02:59:58,340
So we'll watch this.

2073
02:59:58,340 --> 02:59:59,500
We'll chill with this game.

2074
02:59:59,580 --> 03:00:04,540
I can't put the stream up, but we can watch the matches too if we want when it starts.

2075
03:00:05,260 --> 03:00:07,220
But Will, happy birthday to you.

2076
03:00:07,600 --> 03:00:09,200

Yeah, happy birthday.

2080
03:00:15,340 --> 03:00:16,840
The mainstream loves me.

2081
03:00:16,940 --> 03:00:17,900
I'm not even playing.

2082
03:00:18,200 --> 03:00:19,520
Did they show my...

2083
03:00:19,520 --> 03:00:21,460
No, they didn't show our games, though.

2084
03:00:21,960 --> 03:00:23,000
I don't understand how...

2085
03:00:24,540 --> 03:00:26,060
Our games weren't shown.

2086
03:00:26,540 --> 03:00:29,820
We only had, like, one game that was shown.

2087
03:00:32,160 --> 03:00:32,680
Um...

2088
03:00:34,860 --> 03:00:36,560
Yeah, they only...

2089
03:00:36,560 --> 03:00:37,920
Oh, are they gonna watch it now?

2090
03:00:38,180 --> 03:00:38,660
Oh, okay.

2091
03:00:39,520 --> 03:00:41,140
I mean, we could watch ourselves.

2092
03:00:45,540 --> 03:00:47,580
Oh, I'm literally slouching right now.

2093
03:00:47,660 --> 03:00:48,420
I'm so chill.

2094
03:00:50,320 --> 03:00:51,760
They're seeing the replays.

2095
03:00:52,340 --> 03:00:52,760
Nice.

2096
03:00:54,360 --> 03:01:09,780
I'm sorry if I swore I was like in the zone for it if I did swear I'm so sorry I don't know what I wasn't thinking, okay, if I did swear.

2097
03:01:11,420 --> 03:01:11,680
Oh!

2098
03:01:13,900 --> 03:01:21,240
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

2099
03:01:24,550 --> 03:01:32,290
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, they're watching replays, but, like, we don't have to watch, I mean, I'll watch the replays, but, you know what I mean, I know what happened.

2100
03:01:45,190 --> 03:02:10,950
been uh no it's not my match yet it's uh it's uh who's my it's emily's match they're not watching us yet we already know we experienced it yeah yeah watch me you won't watch me do the head okay but she thought i was gonna do the headbutt all the time but i mixed it up you see that I mixed it up.

2101
03:02:11,310 --> 03:02:12,670
Now I put in the heavy attack.

2102
03:02:12,770 --> 03:02:14,690
I saw she was blocking my headbutt.

2103
03:02:15,190 --> 03:02:17,910
She didn't know I had a third move.

2104
03:02:21,970 --> 03:02:25,110
She didn't know my move number three.

2105
03:02:25,630 --> 03:02:31,510
She's like, oh, she's just going to spam headbutt because the other two players, the other two players, I just used a headbutt.

2106
03:02:31,630 --> 03:02:33,830
But she didn't know about my third move.

2107
03:02:34,470 --> 03:02:36,530
The third secret move.

2108
03:02:39,010 --> 03:02:40,670
It's just that simple.

2109
03:02:46,950 --> 03:02:47,610
Oh, my God.

2110
03:02:50,190 --> 03:02:51,090
Yeah, and I blocked, too.

2111
03:02:51,150 --> 03:02:52,410
She didn't think I would block.

2112
03:02:52,730 --> 03:02:54,490
This was the one moment I blocked.

2113
03:03:04,900 --> 03:03:06,880
Wait, okay, don't get...

2114
03:03:06,880 --> 03:03:07,820
Okay, I don't remember.

2115
03:03:08,060 --> 03:03:09,420
Okay, my fourth move is...

2116
03:03:09,420 --> 03:03:10,580
Okay, my first move...

2117
03:03:10,580 --> 03:03:11,560
Okay, I shouldn't say it on stream.

2118
03:03:11,640 --> 03:03:12,120
Whatever you're...

2119
03:03:12,120 --> 03:03:14,060
Okay, now whatever you're looking at my vibe.

2120
03:03:15,420 --> 03:03:17,680
I won't let you tell you my fourth move.

2121
03:03:19,520 --> 03:03:24,020
is a secret I'll never tell

2122
03:03:27,500 --> 03:03:41,680
don't yeah don't reveal the fourth move guys no no one knows no one knows my fourth move

2123
03:03:45,450 --> 03:03:49,950
oh but

2124
03:03:53,910 --> 03:03:56,930
um bum bum bum bum bum bum bum

2125
03:04:02,770 --> 03:04:06,150
yeah not even i know what it is

2126
03:04:13,460 --> 03:04:24,700
it's a secret guys i told you it's a secret if i don't know the fourth move they don't know the fourth move either yeah if the fourth move is whatever i feel like it

2127
03:04:32,240 --> 03:04:54,220
exactly it's how i keep them on their toes the mind game oh my god it's been three hours though oh my god also why okay this is also why i haven't joined any stage mslam after the street fighter one because it was long i i got too tired

2128
03:04:57,940 --> 03:05:46,660
it made me too tired um and this is shorter this is less teams yeah yeah yeah it was yeah honestly the three hours did pass by really fast though it did pass by really fast but like the thing about the slam like um was that like it's three it's three different days of that amount of hours plus the labbing too so like it made me so tired in general that like i i just didn't have the energy to do more slams after that because like it's just a lot of commitment to um like uh i did nephew asked me like oh would i do another slam again and then i was like it really it really depends on the game like i want to be a beginner forever you know i Because I feel like after this,

2129
03:05:46,980 --> 03:05:49,660
I don't think Seijam's gonna put me in beginner.

2130
03:05:50,660 --> 03:05:53,220
I don't think so.

2131
03:05:53,620 --> 03:05:56,440
I don't think he's gonna put me in beginner.

2132
03:05:57,460 --> 03:06:00,740
So I want to be a baby forever.

2133
03:06:01,160 --> 03:06:04,900
Because if I'm not in beginner, I have to learn so much.

2134
03:06:05,260 --> 03:06:07,620
I have to be like diamond or master rank.

2135
03:06:07,720 --> 03:06:08,380
That's the thing.

2136
03:06:09,680 --> 03:06:12,000
And I don't want to climb the diamond or master.

2137
03:06:12,900 --> 03:06:13,880
I can't cheese.

2138
03:06:14,020 --> 03:06:14,220
That's it.

2139
03:06:14,300 --> 03:06:24,420
You can't cheese and diamond and master Oh, yeah, no, I'm watching the mainstream Guys hype me up on the mainstream guys

2140
03:06:29,140 --> 03:06:32,780
Guys, where's my where's my loyal fans?

2141
03:06:33,380 --> 03:06:34,700
Let's go Doki.

2142
03:06:35,300 --> 03:06:50,760
Yeah, very authentic guys No, I don't think my brain has the source space where jp guys oh yeah don't sorry don't raid the channel don't raid the channel

2143
03:06:59,140 --> 03:07:43,240
it's okay it's okay kid is here to represent all of us they're here to represent the dragons the one dragon with the light sticks oh my god literally because of my game we were 10 we were one match ahead of of them that's crazy it literally because of my game that is so much pressure right that is so much pressure oh yeah that's why I didn't want to be last that's why I didn't want to be last oh yeah I was the tiebreaker breaker.

2144
03:07:44,040 --> 03:07:45,040
I really was.

2145
03:07:46,720 --> 03:07:48,380
Ah, that was the anchor.

2146
03:07:48,560 --> 03:07:49,960
I ain't the anchor no more, though.

2147
03:07:51,320 --> 03:07:52,580
That's Feisty's job.

2148
03:07:54,680 --> 03:07:55,540
Oh, am I the MVP?

2149
03:07:55,840 --> 03:07:56,520
That's me!

2150
03:07:57,340 --> 03:07:57,900
Yippee!

2151
03:08:00,640 --> 03:08:02,020
I did that.

2152
03:08:03,440 --> 03:08:04,780
I did that.

2153
03:08:05,000 --> 03:08:06,960
Good shout out to Big Bird and Nephew.

2154
03:08:08,460 --> 03:08:08,720
What?

2155
03:08:08,800 --> 03:08:09,760
There's no strategy.

2156
03:08:12,700 --> 03:08:24,220
I'm playing off of vibes They think I go in with I don't even remember how I won that fight Like legitimately I don't know what my strat is I just play off vibes I adapt on the fly

2157
03:08:33,150 --> 03:09:09,770
Yeah I'm just vibing I do something Okay this is my strat If it keeps working I do it again Because then you don't expect me to keep doing it because they're like surely she'll use a different move but like the thing they don't they don't know that um they don't know that i i there's no reason to stop like no way she'll do it the fourth five and then like when they start figuring out then i lock in

2158
03:09:13,530 --> 03:09:18,290
Then I start mixing it up by throwing the most random stuff possible.

2159
03:09:22,110 --> 03:09:22,470
Yeah.

2160
03:09:25,670 --> 03:09:27,750
The no mix up mix up, exactly.

2161
03:09:28,430 --> 03:09:29,470
Yeah, they never figured it out.

2162
03:09:29,590 --> 03:09:30,690
I change it.

2163
03:09:33,510 --> 03:09:34,330
Time to train.

2164
03:09:34,470 --> 03:09:35,230
We fight one.

2165
03:09:35,390 --> 03:09:36,490
We just fight the Aki.

2166
03:09:36,790 --> 03:09:37,410
That's it.

2167
03:09:41,130 --> 03:09:41,530
Oh.

2168
03:09:43,490 --> 03:09:44,970
When Elite realized that we...

2169
03:09:44,990 --> 03:10:00,470
be too late they're gonna realize no i think i think i think i can realize it now that's why i have to swap it up now what other moves does she know they don't know if i don't know they won't know

2170
03:10:05,390 --> 03:10:11,570
how would i know guys why are they asking so many questions why are they

2171
03:10:14,990 --> 03:10:47,010
asking questions you don't know i don't know the answer to yeah i can play against you the thing is i think she's gonna adapt that's the thing i'm pretty sure she'll adapt like every goddamn fighting game like fgc player like god damn adapting on the fly like adapting in between games god damn it i'm pretty sure i'm pretty sure she's gonna change up her playstyle

2172
03:10:50,420 --> 03:10:53,480
that's usually how it goes i hate it

2173
03:10:57,400 --> 03:11:04,360
yeah they adapt that's cheating i know right there shouldn't be a thing

2174
03:11:07,460 --> 03:11:21,380
we should play the same way just play the same way um wait did you guys see the rules they just posted we have to hit 70 points what do you mean 70 how do we get 70.

2175
03:11:21,620 --> 03:12:24,240
what does that mean you have to play like new series yeah you just keep playing again like so we'll be home for the first time and then away for the second time and then the third time oh my god that's crazy what that's actually crazy what that's so what that's crazy man we're a winner side like what but you i think it's three times no i guess you got dad fast like more i because we'll have we'll have two sets as home potentially oh yeah that's true or we can just bring it home now in one one and a half set yeah that's true yeah yeah yeah yeah oh my god yeah what's crazy is uh theoretically it there's only 50 points to distribute so you could play a third series yeah oh my god oh my god this is my three times this is gonna last like more five hours bro yeah

2176
03:12:28,900 --> 03:12:32,060
yeah whoever goes first is actually a really important person then yeah

2177
03:12:36,960 --> 03:12:40,240
so one of the matches is still worth 20.

2178
03:12:41,100 --> 03:12:44,080
yeah the third match of every series is still worth 20.

2179
03:12:45,400 --> 03:13:23,860
wait does that mean when they're away they can pick someone else to be the 20 pointer yes yeah oh my god so they're probably gonna pick one of y'all good luck guys no god help me okay oh i believe i believe in you i'm not god but i believe in you all right coach queue it up all right i could you want to move to the orientation channel oh okay guys i gotta take my winner p now no more anxiety i feel like that's kind of weird random people be right back i could just go in like our own discord yeah

2180
03:13:45,200 --> 03:14:10,730
oh yeah so if you if you knock me down are we safe i'm here uh-huh yeah if you if you knock me down with like your auto light combo you can just dash and do that one yeah or maybe don't maybe don't dash this time it because you have to do the dash immediately if you dash it'll auto-time it oh and let me just

2181
03:14:24,540 --> 03:14:29,440
into your yeah you do db yeah

2182
03:14:45,490 --> 03:14:47,790
you go into level one if you have it

2183
03:14:56,990 --> 03:15:05,660
you're doing it too late but then like don't you have to like wait for the confirm

2184
03:15:08,860 --> 03:15:12,780
yeah i can just try blocking yeah

2185
03:15:17,700 --> 03:15:25,060
you want to see if i hit or not i don't know if i have the capabilities

2186
03:15:33,080 --> 03:15:52,860
definitely can do it it's like maybe the easiest confirm in the game okay thanks for letting me know i don't want to just do this one uh yeah you could do that one too but the other one does more damage than that one the back of you

2187
03:15:55,960 --> 03:16:02,620
because the problem is you're guessing right like 20 times to win the round when you do the auto light

2188
03:16:13,640 --> 03:16:42,960
you see that does a thousand and the other one does like 24 on you i am back guys it was such a winning pee that i gave dad an extra treat because i feel like a winner so i want you you're gonna be a winner too i'm a winner so you get to be a winner as well i like how we don't even know like we might not even win the grand finals But I'm just like,

2189
03:16:43,000 --> 03:16:43,700
I don't care.

2190
03:16:43,840 --> 03:16:44,880
I got there.

2191
03:16:45,600 --> 03:16:49,000
I know I did my job.

2192
03:16:51,880 --> 03:16:52,520
Yeah.

2193
03:16:53,480 --> 03:16:56,160
If I'm MVP, you're MVP too.

2194
03:16:57,840 --> 03:17:00,860
Oh, Emily down.

2195
03:17:01,820 --> 03:17:03,000
Don't worry, I got you.

2196
03:17:05,780 --> 03:17:06,740
I'm not.

2197
03:17:07,100 --> 03:17:09,840
I like, if I lose to the Aki, I don't care.

2198
03:17:11,060 --> 03:17:14,380
like, I did all I could.

2199
03:17:19,200 --> 03:17:22,000
Win or lose, I'm already proud of myself.

2200
03:17:23,920 --> 03:17:27,140
And maybe do more charged fireballs when she's knocked down, too.

2201
03:17:27,460 --> 03:17:28,600
Yeah, I already won.

2202
03:17:32,000 --> 03:17:33,560
I already won.

2203
03:17:33,880 --> 03:17:39,320
Apparently people were saying, like, it wasn't fair that, like, I was put in the beginner.

2204
03:17:39,620 --> 03:18:12,800
But I legitimately thought, I literally thought I was a beginning because i just saw street fighter right after the slap like only lose a few jabs i was i'm i'm sorry i i haven't touched the game for a year plus yeah okay how about the jump thing okay just try yeah yeah jump out like a normal and i learned a new character too do a little later yeah i was i was hard stuck silver for the thing is i was hard stuck silver for gif

2205
03:18:18,040 --> 03:18:20,300
Yeah, I changed character

2206
03:18:23,360 --> 03:19:33,980
So i was surprised like people were like oh i don't know dorky Maybe not should have been in the beginning you just can't do it too close like try doing it like So i was just like i was like you're a bit farther i was like i swear to god like i was like i swear to god i didn't lie my resume i i even explained it in the in the application i explained it in the application i was like i and them saw street fighter right after the last slam so i don't remember what like i don't remember anything i think she's doing a forward jump but the thing is saratina she was a last minute sub so she jumps out of the because the other player um the other players uh that was originally was in her spot um was was it was like a beginner player i think she was awesome i don't know she was in the slam before but oh my god um but she was also a beginner player but because she dropped out like a day the the day before i think like on tuesday she dropped out on tuesday or wednesday they had to fight an

2207
03:19:33,980 --> 03:19:52,900
emergency so like i think because like oh yeah um oh yeah like the um so they got like 13 up for it yeah and then charge up the fireball if you learn you were to join another cjms set and that's beginner you should like i i don't want to be above beginner

2208
03:19:56,360 --> 03:20:12,120
that the thing is in diamond to master elop i can't cheese away i can't do knowledge checks because i have to actually run combos and like i think everyone else in the tier above me play classic too.

2209
03:20:13,620 --> 03:20:14,260
That's the thing.

2210
03:20:14,680 --> 03:20:15,600
They all play classic.

2211
03:20:15,800 --> 03:20:17,820
I'm just a filthy modern player.

2212
03:20:18,340 --> 03:20:29,940
Like, I'm just, everyone else, no, there's a filthy, everyone else plays, uses a real input.

2213
03:20:30,180 --> 03:20:32,420
I'm just a filthy modern player.

2214
03:20:37,100 --> 03:20:37,740
Yeah.

2215
03:20:38,380 --> 03:20:58,160
You can hit master easily, the way you are really you really think so if i look i think if i play this game another day i think i maybe i could get like a higher plan i'm not sure what the maybe i feel like every day every day i like jump up a tier after auto light ones wait

2216
03:21:01,510 --> 03:21:12,750
i am a master around 1500 and get knowledge checked all the time like after you land it and you like wait i'm gonna death because they're teaching they're teaching right now.

2217
03:21:13,510 --> 03:21:15,490
I mean, it's going to be a while till they're not.

2218
03:21:15,850 --> 03:21:20,450
I think they just they have even started the first game, guys.

2219
03:21:21,890 --> 03:21:25,650
They haven't even started the first game.

2220
03:21:25,790 --> 03:21:26,970
It's going to be a bit.

2221
03:21:32,050 --> 03:21:33,390
Oh my god.

2222
03:21:33,710 --> 03:21:37,850

We have an hour to kill.

2235

I can react if I want to.

2236
03:24:26,640 --> 03:24:29,100
Honestly, that is a killer line.

2237
03:24:29,300 --> 03:24:31,640
I can't believe he ghosted her right after this.

2238
03:24:31,960 --> 03:24:33,680
That is such a good line.

2239
03:24:35,300 --> 03:24:36,660
That is wife material.

2240
03:24:37,540 --> 03:24:38,940
I can show this.

2241
03:24:43,320 --> 03:24:44,280
Wait a minute.

2242
03:24:44,460 --> 03:24:46,640

03:26:04,820 --> 03:26:06,080
Why can't you go on it?

2251
03:26:06,080 --> 03:26:08,800
Because I have to rely on other people.

2252
03:26:10,720 --> 03:26:13,400
In this, I can only rely on myself.

2253
03:26:15,780 --> 03:26:17,720
Oh, yeah, I got the, yeah, mine's the cat ear.

2254

03:26:19,440 --> 03:26:43,200

I know it's wild.

2289
03:33:00,640 --> 03:33:01,840
I'm going to go outside.

2290
03:33:03,720 --> 03:33:05,000
A victory feast.

2291
03:33:05,460 --> 03:33:05,640
Yeah.

2292
03:33:05,960 --> 03:33:08,840
Is it the, one of the self-service hot pot places too?

2293
03:33:09,620 --> 03:33:09,920
Yeah.

2294
03:33:11,120 --> 03:33:12,200

2295
03:33:12,220 --> 03:33:26,580
you right after this is done um but what was i talking oh yeah but i have there was so much adrenaline and anxiety going and you know it didn't help that my controller wasn't working either

2296
03:33:30,420 --> 03:34:07,490
so i had so much adrenaline anxiety um everything going into the tournament after you know we your grand finals you know all of it just flowed out yeah it all just flowed out and now I'm just so chill yeah it took no no I know I fumbled you guys saw that I couldn't even do the headbutt like I don't I couldn't even I couldn't even do the headbutt chat because of it because I was like oh my god I'm a controller yeah and then like she got like half my HP from it

2297
03:34:10,570 --> 03:34:12,170
Yeah, my first move.

2298
03:34:16,790 --> 03:34:16,970
Yeah.

2299
03:34:20,610 --> 03:34:23,110
Oh, the first round was very shaky.

2300
03:34:24,370 --> 03:34:25,070
Yeah, and then I hit button.

2301
03:34:25,230 --> 03:34:27,830
And then I realized, but I was like, wait a minute, she burns out.

2302
03:34:28,850 --> 03:34:30,690
You know what that means.

2303
03:34:37,280 --> 03:34:38,200
Yippee, though.

2304
03:34:39,400 --> 03:34:40,320
Yippee, yippee, yippee.

2305
03:34:47,330 --> 03:34:56,650
And then bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom.

2306
03:34:57,190 --> 03:34:58,150

Wait, which one?

2308
03:35:00,130 --> 03:35:01,310
There's so many clips.

2309
03:35:05,970 --> 03:35:08,390
Guys, I can't keep track of my clips.

2310
03:35:08,510 --> 03:35:10,250
I always do stupid things.

2311
03:35:10,770 --> 03:35:13,330
Like, you gotta know, you gotta be very specific.

2312
03:35:13,830 --> 03:35:16,210
What stupid thing did I do this time?

2313
03:35:17,330 --> 03:35:32,890

Post it in birdseater so I can, um, so I can, so we can link it on Twitter.

2322
03:36:10,990 --> 03:36:17,270
Right at the start of, oh, when I, my controller DCed and he was like, what am, what am I?

2323
03:36:29,270 --> 03:36:34,730
oh it was after that i was gonna say was he confused that i didn't move

2324
03:36:38,110 --> 03:36:53,690
oh the actual start okay oh yeah when like when uh oh when i fumbled my inputs and burnt out Yeah, because I was that's I was so nervous What is my stress strats?

2325
03:36:54,090 --> 03:36:56,070
Yeah, when I messed up my one button.

2326
03:36:56,410 --> 03:37:15,730
I told you I was I was so nervous I was so nervous that's how now I was like oh my gosh as I didn't I was like oh my gosh I'm gonna be this and I have to be the 20-pointer too and then finding out I have to be the 20-pointer I

2327
03:37:19,010 --> 03:37:21,130
it like it messed with me

2328
03:37:25,970 --> 03:37:35,410
am i still nervous um no i'm more relaxed now because i don't at that point like for me it doesn't matter we got first or second because like i did my job you know

2329
03:37:42,610 --> 03:37:55,350
bro i yeah they should i they should have made me surprised i'd be like why am i playing another game like i was just like why am i playing another They should have done that.

2330
03:37:55,550 --> 03:37:57,070
They should have, like, kept it a surprise.

2331
03:37:57,270 --> 03:37:59,410
And then I'd be like, why am I playing another game?

2332
03:37:59,590 --> 03:38:00,370
Is it not over?

2333
03:38:05,670 --> 03:38:06,030
And...

2334
03:38:06,610 --> 03:38:08,350
They should have done that for me.

2335
03:38:08,850 --> 03:38:10,530
Because that added on, too.

2336
03:38:10,590 --> 03:38:12,390
They should have kept me in the dark.

2337
03:38:15,230 --> 03:38:16,130
I'll be like, I'm the...

2338
03:38:16,130 --> 03:38:17,530
I have to do another set.

2339
03:38:21,940 --> 03:38:23,160
Also, I realized.

2340
03:38:23,340 --> 03:38:24,200
Because, like...

2341
03:38:28,950 --> 03:39:26,070
technically like if you think about it I think Dom or was it Dom's team they had a better advantage because I don't actually let's see because like two teams get to have two teams get the home advantage because we had home advantage twice but depending on the matchups because like we couldn't get home if I feel like we would have being in the lead if um we oh wait no we won it it would have been a lot easier no we did win our home advantage never mind i was gonna say it would have been a lot easier if they put me in the 20 points against the other two players yeah oh every team got home advantage twice oh okay but you know what i mean like um uh if it wasn't against the aki and we get home advantage for the Ryu and the jury,

2342
03:39:26,770 --> 03:39:29,810
it would be less stressful for my team, for sure.

2343
03:39:32,110 --> 03:39:32,530
Yeah.

2344
03:39:37,220 --> 03:39:39,400
I feel like it would have been a lot stressful.

2345
03:39:46,710 --> 03:39:55,230
Because, like, even though I know I was not feeling the 20-pointer, the match would have been a lot easier.

2346
03:39:57,750 --> 03:39:59,010
It went, yeah.

2347
03:40:02,650 --> 03:40:03,250
Yeah.

2348
03:40:03,270 --> 03:40:04,930
Yeah, we probably shared better.

2349
03:40:05,770 --> 03:40:07,230
Oh, posted a video on the tag?

2350
03:40:07,410 --> 03:40:08,230
All right, let's see.

2351
03:40:12,970 --> 03:40:13,370
All right.

2352
03:40:14,590 --> 03:40:15,590
Here's the Twitter.

2353
03:40:15,890 --> 03:40:16,450
Here's the tweet.

2354
03:40:29,510 --> 03:40:31,710
And they're like, wait, what?

2355
03:40:31,970 --> 03:40:33,530
That was nervous!

2356
03:40:40,390 --> 03:40:43,810
Look, okay, right after I was feeling the groove after this.

2357
03:40:43,830 --> 03:40:58,390
that i started off i started off with the crap because i missed something but that was nervous i was so anxious

2358
03:41:05,810 --> 03:41:10,150
it was an

2359
03:41:21,700 --> 03:41:44,740
oopsie yeah it was just an oopsie i i confused them and then they were everyone got confused no one knows my mind even i don't know my mind it was to send a message exactly no one no yeah yeah i knew it was so free that i had to do that grab

2360
03:41:55,610 --> 03:42:03,980
but um but um yeah it was her yeah it was all planned

2361
03:42:30,150 --> 03:42:31,110
Just chilling.

2362
03:42:32,350 --> 03:42:34,370
Sorry, I'm not talking too much, guys.

2363
03:42:34,750 --> 03:42:36,510
I'm just really chilling now.

2364
03:42:40,350 --> 03:42:40,710
Oh, yeah.

2365
03:42:40,890 --> 03:42:42,990
There's some quality geef right now.

2366
03:42:43,170 --> 03:42:44,370
Ah, yes, Zane geef.

2367
03:42:45,030 --> 03:42:50,190
I think I would have struggled even harder if I had to play Zane geef against this matchup.

2368
03:42:50,810 --> 03:43:24,230
Because everyone was, you know, like, everyone countered me everyone technically counters honda but the other players countered zankeef harder yeah yeah so i feel like i felt like even though i did play zankeef it would i would have an even rougher time i went against juri aki and ryu and um and all of like you know i had It's all about trying to get there.

2369
03:43:25,250 --> 03:43:25,650
Like, yeah.

2370
03:43:26,590 --> 03:43:29,690
Yeah, and Honda can just, you know, headbutt.

2371
03:43:30,670 --> 03:43:31,190
Okay.

2372
03:43:34,390 --> 03:43:36,570
You hate the Honda matchup as Aki?

2373
03:43:36,830 --> 03:43:39,390
I hate fighting Aki's, too, in rank.

2374
03:43:40,670 --> 03:43:42,110
Um, I don't know.

2375
03:43:42,910 --> 03:43:47,610
I hate fighting all three of those players, like, all those three of those characters as Honda.

2376
03:43:48,210 --> 03:43:52,670
I think the easiest character to be as Honda...

2377
03:43:52,690 --> 03:43:56,330
In my Ilo, in my Ilo was Jamie.

2378
03:43:57,810 --> 03:44:01,290
Every time I see a Jamie, I'm like, and, and, um, and Akuma.

2379
03:44:02,410 --> 03:44:07,070
Uh, Akuma slash Bison, because they like to use Drive Impact a lot.

2380
03:44:07,510 --> 03:44:11,630
They like to use DUI, so I can, I can just, like, headbutt infinitely.

2381
03:44:17,020 --> 03:44:18,360
That's every Ilo.

2382
03:44:20,300 --> 03:44:22,600
That's every Ilo for Jamie.

2383
03:44:24,380 --> 03:44:24,820
Yeah.

2384
03:44:25,880 --> 03:44:56,700
have to stick our one or could you choose you can choose any character but you know a lot some of these players are new so they just play their mains yeah everyone just plays their mains because you know well to be fair i was technically i didn't want to play gif there because like i heard gif got nerfed so i was just like bro bro and then i saw i was asking like nephew like do you know who what they're playing and nephew was like oh yeah like um um one of them was an aki And then I was like,

2385
03:44:56,740 --> 03:44:57,540
yeah, I'm not playing Gif.

2386
03:45:01,120 --> 03:45:06,820
Because, like, I remember in the stage I'm slam, Aki was, like, the one I struggled the most because I had to change my tempo.

2387
03:45:08,760 --> 03:45:12,900
I had to change the tempo of how I play.

2388
03:45:13,020 --> 03:45:14,040
So I was like, I'm not playing him.

2389
03:45:14,520 --> 03:45:19,920
Like, like, freak that.

2390
03:45:22,520 --> 03:45:25,860
Yeah, I wanted an easier time for this tournament.

2391
03:45:25,880 --> 03:45:26,260
too.

2392
03:45:26,660 --> 03:45:29,640
I just want to be like headfoot.

2393
03:45:32,580 --> 03:45:33,320
Yeah, and it was the same.

2394
03:45:33,420 --> 03:45:35,000
And I saw it was like the same one too.

2395
03:45:35,580 --> 03:45:42,040
Because like, I remember like I remember like Saratina had a really rough time in the slam.

2396
03:45:42,460 --> 03:45:43,260
Because she was playing classic.

2397
03:45:43,400 --> 03:45:50,760
She was like one of the her and was it Saikuna were the only players trying to play classic in the beginner level.

2398
03:45:52,680 --> 03:46:30,880
I remember I like when I had the Zangiefs sweep um during one of the group stages like you know i did really well in um i did really well during i think like day two um but seratina's akki was the hardest matchup for me it was the hardest fight for me because like um i was super aggressive for the other against the other opponents but the akki had to change my tempo and so i had to like play a lot slower and that sucks for me um I hate playing really slow when I'm on Zangief But on Honda,

2399
03:46:31,140 --> 03:46:35,660
it's a lot easier to play super slow Yeah

2400
03:46:39,360 --> 03:46:59,140
Yeah, because on Honda, I can play slow and fast at the same time Like I can adapt to be slower fast But on Zangief, I could play fast I was able to get away with playing super fast And just, like, just go attack, attack, attack In rank and also in practice because people didn't expect that.

2401
03:46:59,320 --> 03:47:03,280
Like, you know, like, the higher you go, the more passive Zen Gif players are.

2402
03:47:03,680 --> 03:47:06,980
So people didn't expect me to go, like, hard aggression on Gif.

2403
03:47:07,640 --> 03:47:14,160
Because if I make my first move and never let them have the move next, like, they're already dead because the grapples were so strong.

2404
03:47:17,100 --> 03:47:25,460
But then, like, when I had to play against the Aki, I had to be, like, I had to be the slowest player ever.

2405
03:47:25,460 --> 03:47:27,380
It was so tilting for me.

2406
03:47:27,760 --> 03:47:31,160
It was just, it was, it was like super frustrating and I did not enjoy it.

2407
03:47:31,400 --> 03:47:31,580
Yeah.

2408
03:47:37,270 --> 03:47:39,110
Yeah, it was not enjoyable.

2409
03:47:39,650 --> 03:47:41,650
So I like that for Honda.

2410
03:47:44,170 --> 03:47:45,850
No, I have to wait for a while.

2411
03:47:46,490 --> 03:47:48,290
It's now the third match now.

2412
03:47:49,090 --> 03:47:56,250
But for Honda, it was a lot easier to adapt to fast and slow.

2413
03:47:58,230 --> 03:48:15,650
it was easier to react to like to change my play style on Honda how much longer I think it'll be an hour before we begin I'm pretty sure I think it's going to be a while guys

2414
03:48:18,950 --> 03:48:21,350
it's going to take a bit

2415
03:48:27,040 --> 03:48:30,900
yeah I'm just looking through Twitter right now

2416
03:48:34,390 --> 03:48:39,010
Um Bum Bum Bum Bum Bum

2417
03:48:50,520 --> 03:49:25,240
Um Well They're not really I mean it's just their make way I mean it's the third game They just have to hit 50 points They're at Guys Oh my god They're I'm so tempted to end stream And then come back part two of the tournament bro i just have to wait oh my god they're both at 10 points and then they have to get the 50 oh my god i didn't think this through all right and that's the way for another set

2418
03:49:28,580 --> 03:49:59,120
oh my god i wasn't thinking this through guys no i shouldn't the thing is i don't know about i don't think i'm allowed to play anything else i think i'm just by the way the thing is like um they were even like please don't play copyright music like to us too they're like please stop don't play copyright music because we're they're supposed to pull videos off of our own stream too um off of our stream too so like i don't want to get in trouble

2419
03:50:02,280 --> 03:50:05,880
no it wasn't there wasn't a contract i just showed up

2420
03:50:10,060 --> 03:50:12,580
What do we do to burn time bro?

2421
03:50:12,700 --> 03:50:13,180
I don't know.

2422
03:50:13,280 --> 03:50:14,500
Do I just make a part two?

2423
03:50:14,500 --> 03:50:16,840
What if I just make a part two waiting room?

2424
03:50:17,860 --> 03:50:18,240
No.

2425
03:50:20,080 --> 03:50:22,820
Because I don't know how long I'll be waiting for it.

2426
03:50:25,800 --> 03:50:27,820
Well, I shouldn't be, I shouldn't be in trouble.

2427
03:50:27,960 --> 03:50:29,680
I'm just waiting for my finals.

2428
03:50:30,960 --> 03:50:32,960
I do not, I'm not gonna nap.

2429
03:50:33,360 --> 03:50:34,540
I'm just hanging out.

2430
03:50:35,460 --> 03:50:37,880
I don't want to, the thing is, I don't want to warm up.

2431
03:50:38,700 --> 03:51:09,700
um I don't want to spend like two hours warming up because then I get way too tired because that happens to me when I like um you know like when you're playing rank and then like you get worse as you play because obviously like you get you know you get fatigue from rank um I'll definitely drink some coffee though right but like before my game because I am feeling tired yeah so like I don't want to I'll warm up an hour before uh just restream the thing is I need to set that up I usually set that up before a stream,

2432
03:51:09,840 --> 03:51:10,880
but I did not do that.

2433
03:51:18,060 --> 03:51:20,300
So I'd rather just wait, like, and out.

2434
03:51:20,380 --> 03:51:23,660
Like, I guess, like, when the second bracket starts, I'll warm up.

2435
03:51:25,480 --> 03:51:34,820
Because I think, like, legitimately, I'm pretty sure, like, IDOM's team is just gonna sweep it.

2436
03:51:35,300 --> 03:51:36,560
Like, sweep the semis.

2437
03:51:37,280 --> 03:51:38,000
I'm pretty sure.

2438
03:51:38,200 --> 03:51:40,180
Because the only team they struggled with was us.

2439
03:51:41,960 --> 03:51:44,340
So I'm pretty sure they'll just sweep the...

2440
03:51:44,340 --> 03:51:46,200
I would be very surprised if...

2441
03:51:47,980 --> 03:51:50,200
Because like the...

2442
03:51:52,300 --> 03:51:54,940
The matchups are very...

2443
03:51:54,940 --> 03:51:56,780
I mean they're very close too.

2444
03:51:56,860 --> 03:51:57,580
They're very close.

2445
03:51:57,800 --> 03:51:58,640
But when they were...

2446
03:51:58,640 --> 03:52:04,440
But like I feel like it's between Nephew and Idom team versus...

2447
03:52:04,440 --> 03:52:05,160
We're close.

2448
03:52:05,420 --> 03:52:06,720
Our skill level is close.

2449
03:52:07,060 --> 03:52:08,180
But Brian and...

2450
03:52:08,200 --> 03:52:30,920
is not like they are like um they're like um like they're the other the two they're close together but uh yeah did we struggle i don't remember i didn't struggle i was fine

2451
03:52:38,860 --> 03:52:40,400
I had a good time.

2452
03:52:43,920 --> 03:52:44,720
Oh, no.

2453
03:52:45,120 --> 03:52:46,320
The ego's back.

2454
03:52:48,840 --> 03:52:50,340
On the start, Arcade mode.

2455
03:52:50,560 --> 03:52:53,620
No, like I said, I don't want to, I don't want to, like, play too much.

2456
03:52:56,380 --> 03:52:57,600
It was tougher for the others.

2457
03:52:57,740 --> 03:52:59,660
Yeah, that's why I'm saying, I don't want to be a beginner.

2458
03:53:01,320 --> 03:53:04,880
That's why, like, I don't want to know about doing a Z-Jamp slam for Street Fighter.

2459
03:53:05,520 --> 03:53:50,540
Because, like, because if I had to, another they won't put me in beginner if i have to be in a different tier i ain't chill i ain't chilling i literally played nine hours of honda in the last three days because like the thing is i found out i was gonna be in the um uh the capcon tournament thing like a week before it was announced so technically i could have i found out about it on the 22nd guys that was gonna be in the in the capcon tournament i waited until this week tuesday to practice to install the game

2460
03:53:54,620 --> 03:54:13,720
i wouldn't be able to do that if i was in a different tier guys i wouldn't guys i would not have been able to do that if i was in a different tier also it's because like um I think like all the FGC players were traveling to somewhere.

2461
03:54:14,000 --> 03:54:14,380
We're watching.

2462
03:54:14,560 --> 03:54:16,340
We're traveling to where was it?

2463
03:54:19,460 --> 03:54:25,160
To there was a street fighter tournament around that time when it got announced.

2464
03:54:25,280 --> 03:54:26,200
I don't even remember what it's called.

2465
03:54:26,360 --> 03:54:27,180
But everyone's like traveling.

2466
03:54:27,420 --> 03:54:33,020
So because like I asked Nephew like, oh like when can we get like a coaching session?

2467
03:54:33,700 --> 03:54:35,820
And Nephew was like, oh, I'll be back on Tuesday.

2468
03:54:37,040 --> 03:54:38,120
But like if you want, we could.

2469
03:54:38,200 --> 03:54:41,760
Like, I'll be back on Monday, so we could do it a day earlier, too.

2470
03:54:42,680 --> 03:54:43,880
Because I was thinking, like, oh, should I start?

2471
03:54:44,460 --> 03:54:46,620
Because I knew, like, I needed a coaching session.

2472
03:54:46,720 --> 03:54:49,480
It wouldn't matter if I just opened the game without a coach, you know?

2473
03:54:49,800 --> 03:54:51,440
Because it's, like, I don't know what I'm doing.

2474
03:54:51,600 --> 03:54:54,700
Like, I don't understand fighting games.

2475
03:54:54,980 --> 03:54:58,180
So, like, I had to wait for, like, coaches to be available.

2476
03:54:59,000 --> 03:55:02,160
And, like, at that time, like, Nephew was, like, I'm still traveling.

2477
03:55:02,340 --> 03:55:06,540
I'll be back around, I'll be back around, like, Monday.

2478
03:55:07,000 --> 03:55:08,180
So I was just like, I'll just wait Tuesday.

2479
03:55:08,200 --> 03:56:04,080
because like Tuesday we're supposed to be like broadcast on this channel anyway and then um and then you know Justin was like traveling too for with his family as well so I was like oh I'll just yeah I'll just wait on Tuesday then like I also I think I think that if I if I got earlier coaching I think people will complain more Because I'm pretty sure I'd be A lot higher ranked Like I would show up being diamond or something In the beginning level I'd just be like the Honda and diamond And against a rookie I think people would be very mad So I could Yeah I think they would put me in the They would swap in with someone else I think Yeah,

2480
03:56:04,260 --> 03:56:05,060
absolutely.

2481
03:56:05,560 --> 03:56:10,260
If I didn't play Marvel Rivals instead of in Sub-Street Fighter.

2482
03:56:14,380 --> 03:56:16,080
Yeah, it worked out.

2483
03:56:17,440 --> 03:56:18,880
I just showed up as Platt.

2484
03:56:20,280 --> 03:56:26,200
No, I think, like, the fact that Sir Tina's in it and not, like, the person that she filled in, I think people will be very mad.

2485
03:56:26,840 --> 03:56:30,380
Because, you know, I'm very sad because the other player is also new, too.

2486
03:56:30,680 --> 03:56:38,660
So, like, I would actually, at least, like, you know, 13 hour, both the same rank.

2487
03:56:38,920 --> 03:56:42,660
Because I don't know what Elo, the other person, the person she was placing was.

2488
03:56:43,080 --> 03:56:49,720
So I feel like, yeah, I feel like I, people would be not happy about that.

2489
03:56:53,640 --> 03:56:56,540
I didn't think I would pick it up so fast, guys.

2490
03:56:56,740 --> 03:56:57,680
You don't understand.

2491
03:56:58,300 --> 03:57:01,280
I didn't think I'd pick up how to play this video game so fast.

2492
03:57:06,400 --> 03:57:28,280
yeah i legitimately thought i was like i don't know maybe i lied to myself but i legitimately thought i was beginner level just because like um i felt like i i don't retain information long term very well um and um and i was like learning a new character too maybe i'm just a fast learner i could be

2493
03:57:32,050 --> 03:57:37,890
maybe i mean i feel like i'm just i i mean i am like a fast learner in general.

2494
03:57:38,190 --> 03:57:39,170
I just learned very fast.

2495
03:57:39,610 --> 03:57:42,430
I think it's just from my experience in FPS games too.

2496
03:57:43,310 --> 03:57:43,450
Yeah.

2497
03:57:44,970 --> 03:57:51,490
I think it was just, it's just like, just the knowledge transfer from FPS games.

2498
03:57:51,670 --> 03:57:53,810
So I have to react very fast in general.

2499
03:57:54,910 --> 03:58:03,910
Um, because like the other, the thing is, the other two because like, you know, we have like FPS players in this tournament that just picked up, like Karkew.

2500
03:58:04,110 --> 03:58:29,190
Karkew was, is a top 500 Overwatch player, and I think like he was beginner like he was beginner tier in the sage i'm slam and then now he's like in master yeah now he's like in master the thing about that makes me different from me and the other fps players that joined sage i'm slam they kept playing i i i sort of uninstalled

2501
03:58:35,950 --> 03:58:43,430
yeah also i can't do combos too i kind of do combos you can try and force it in my head but i won't be able to understand

2502
03:58:47,750 --> 03:59:09,290
you won't yeah you i won't be i do my auto combos it's all about auto here that's why when i see the beginner players try to use uh use like uh classic i'm just like bro Power to you.

2503
03:59:12,450 --> 03:59:13,970
All the power to you.

2504
03:59:17,870 --> 03:59:19,910
Maturasu, thank you for the magenta soup.

2505
03:59:20,250 --> 03:59:21,350
Thank you, thank you.

2506
03:59:21,690 --> 03:59:23,050
Yoki, you're born natural and neutral.

2507
03:59:23,190 --> 03:59:26,010
Most people are thinking meter, thinking drag, thinking combos.

2508
03:59:26,170 --> 03:59:28,430
You just think, I bet they won't see this coming, lol.

2509
03:59:28,570 --> 03:59:30,870
And that makes you perfect for grapplers and big bodies.

2510
03:59:31,030 --> 03:59:33,770
You're fine just the way you are.

2511
03:59:34,970 --> 03:59:37,050
You mean they think five steps ahead?

2512
03:59:37,370 --> 03:59:39,650
I'm legitimately thinking as I go.

2513
03:59:40,850 --> 03:59:42,350
Sometimes I'm not thinking.

2514
03:59:44,190 --> 03:59:45,530
What the heck combos?

2515
03:59:45,810 --> 03:59:47,070
What is that?

2516
03:59:50,890 --> 03:59:53,950
What is that even me?

2517
04:00:06,630 --> 04:00:08,210
Yeah, exactly.

2518
04:00:08,410 --> 04:00:10,290
That's why I'm perfect for...

2519
04:00:11,290 --> 04:00:13,350
That's why I'm perfect for the beginner level.

2520
04:00:33,190 --> 04:00:34,730
Where are they at now?

2521
04:00:35,030 --> 04:00:36,950
Okay, they're at their fourth match now.

2522
04:00:37,570 --> 04:00:38,930
Okay, so they just need to win.

2523
04:00:39,090 --> 04:00:41,190
Brian's team just need to win two games.

2524
04:00:42,010 --> 04:00:43,990
And it does, I don't know if it looks like that.

2525
04:00:45,070 --> 04:00:47,590
I don't know.

2526
04:00:53,140 --> 04:00:56,820
I swear to God, if it gets to 40-40, I swear to God.

2527
04:00:56,880 --> 04:00:58,140
Yeah, no, Brian's team.

2528
04:00:58,240 --> 04:00:58,740
I don't know.

2529
04:00:58,820 --> 04:01:00,100
He just got a perfect KO.

2530
04:01:00,720 --> 04:01:02,900
Beckman just got a perfect KO, guys.

2531
04:01:07,110 --> 04:01:10,930
Oh, yeah, this is also why, like, I watched the 2X KO stream.

2532
04:01:12,970 --> 04:01:21,210
Um, and, like, and, and, like, bro, like, it feels like the combo lasts 20 years.

2533
04:01:22,850 --> 04:01:26,610
Like, the moment you get hit by one combo, you're just dead.

2534
04:01:27,030 --> 04:01:28,030
I was watching it.

2535
04:01:28,070 --> 04:01:29,810
Like, I was watching the 2xKO slam.

2536
04:01:30,550 --> 04:01:32,610
It felt so scary.

2537
04:01:32,870 --> 04:01:35,210
Like, you have to be aware.

2538
04:01:36,370 --> 04:01:37,910
For anyone that plays the 2xKO...

2539
04:01:37,910 --> 04:01:39,730
Yeah, it felt like an infinite combo.

2540
04:01:40,050 --> 04:01:40,790
Like, yeah.

2541
04:01:43,230 --> 04:01:45,090
You have seen nothing yet.

2542
04:01:45,310 --> 04:01:45,550
It felt...

2543
04:01:45,550 --> 04:01:46,750
Yeah, it was like...

2544
04:01:46,750 --> 04:01:47,990
And then, like, the tag...

2545
04:01:47,990 --> 04:01:51,050
And then you have to be aware of, like, whenever they're going to use the tag team.

2546
04:01:51,190 --> 04:01:52,830
But different tag teams have different...

2547
04:01:52,850 --> 04:01:56,650
like high low medium hit too um

2548
04:02:01,950 --> 04:02:07,810
that was like techin not how i play techin

2549
04:02:12,030 --> 04:02:16,500
not how i play there was no auto moves in techin for me

2550
04:02:19,830 --> 04:02:32,250
yeah they were doing duos too they were doing duos as well i heard like official 2x ko tournaments started banning Timo because of how not fun.

2551
04:02:32,430 --> 04:02:33,750
Like, Timo and Echo, right?

2552
04:02:33,830 --> 04:02:34,410
I don't remember.

2553
04:02:35,090 --> 04:02:42,410
They banned, like, I think they were trying to do, like, tournaments without Timo and Echo because, like, they were, like, super oppressive or something.

2554
04:02:42,910 --> 04:02:43,990
So, I saw that on Twitter.

2555
04:02:45,190 --> 04:02:45,510
Good.

2556
04:02:47,790 --> 04:02:49,570
Do you guys see the Avatar?

2557
04:02:49,830 --> 04:02:54,970
The Avatar fighting game that got released and everyone was, like, chit-talking it?

2558
04:02:57,850 --> 04:02:59,970
To be fair, like...

2559
04:03:01,390 --> 04:03:04,390
Yes, it's like animated, but like...

2560
04:03:04,390 --> 04:03:06,810
It felt like they did it in Flash.

2561
04:03:06,950 --> 04:03:07,810
You know what I'm saying?

2562
04:03:08,390 --> 04:03:10,290
They felt like they were... It wasn't like...

2563
04:03:10,290 --> 04:03:11,650
Like, it wasn't hand-drawn.

2564
04:03:11,830 --> 04:03:13,650
It felt like they were using like...

2565
04:03:13,650 --> 04:03:15,410
You know, like Flash rigging and stuff.

2566
04:03:16,510 --> 04:03:17,590
No, it's not out.

2567
04:03:17,650 --> 04:03:18,450
It just...

2568
04:03:21,510 --> 04:03:21,910
Uh...

2569
04:03:23,130 --> 04:03:24,750
Yeah, it just...

2570
04:03:24,970 --> 04:03:25,490
I don't know.

2571
04:03:25,590 --> 04:03:26,590
It just looks weird.

2572
04:03:26,850 --> 04:03:30,750
Yeah, it looks like flash games that you can find on the Cartoon Network site.

2573
04:03:30,930 --> 04:03:34,830
It got announced and stuff, and they showed, like, I just wish it looked better.

2574
04:03:35,470 --> 04:03:36,890
I wish it was done.

2575
04:03:37,470 --> 04:03:38,970
It was animated better.

2576
04:03:39,170 --> 04:03:41,050
Yeah, it looked, oh yeah, it looked like Game of Newgrounds.

2577
04:03:41,090 --> 04:03:41,770
I would say that.

2578
04:03:42,930 --> 04:03:44,610
Because, like, I mean, it is pretty exciting.

2579
04:03:44,750 --> 04:03:51,670
And then it looked like Aang could only airbend, while Korra had, like, all the elements and stuff.

2580
04:03:54,970 --> 04:04:27,950
like it's like 30 FPS that's what it looks like that's what the avatar fighting game looks like and then there's like what the invincible tag team one I think it was funny that they made an invincible fighting game because 80% of the roster is just the same powers and then there's what's the name there's the um there's the the see the And then there's CISO with his teleport.

2581
04:04:33,070 --> 04:04:36,650
The guy that's using government funding to teleport.

2582
04:04:38,250 --> 04:04:39,150
Using your taxpayer.

2583
04:04:39,850 --> 04:04:40,670
Payers money.

2584
04:04:41,490 --> 04:04:43,110
His powers is literally money.

2585
04:04:43,550 --> 04:04:44,350
Money go.

2586
04:04:46,910 --> 04:04:47,630
Oh my god.

2587
04:04:47,870 --> 04:04:48,650
It's 30.

2588
04:04:48,730 --> 04:04:49,510
I swear to God.

2589
04:04:49,650 --> 04:04:50,310
If they get to.

2590
04:04:50,430 --> 04:04:50,870
If they.

2591
04:04:51,190 --> 04:04:51,430
Okay.

2592
04:04:51,830 --> 04:04:53,490
What team Brian needs to do.

2593
04:04:53,570 --> 04:04:54,910
It's literally just when they're.

2594
04:04:54,970 --> 04:05:15,890
uh our rounds will you match up yeah i saw that i saw the tweet where they were figuring out what uh how much is combos cost and actual money oh my god i don't know if i should keep talking because i'm getting tired more tired i'm getting tired from just talking

2595
04:05:19,590 --> 04:05:26,570
oh because i'm using my brain i know it's wild Maybe I should get coffee.

2596
04:05:26,890 --> 04:05:27,910
I should only get coffee.

2597
04:05:29,670 --> 04:05:29,870
Oh.

2598
04:05:31,850 --> 04:05:33,590
The rest of you need to.

2599
04:05:33,730 --> 04:05:35,090
I don't want to end stream.

2600
04:05:36,470 --> 04:05:37,590
Oh, end stream.

2601
04:05:38,050 --> 04:05:38,190
No.

2602
04:05:40,710 --> 04:05:42,030
We just vibe.

2603
04:05:43,730 --> 04:05:48,030
I wish I could show the stream on my screen.

2604
04:05:48,590 --> 04:05:50,570
But I can't because I haven't set that option.

2605
04:05:50,670 --> 04:05:51,450
I should have set it up.

2606
04:05:51,590 --> 04:05:52,150
I didn't think.

2607
04:05:52,170 --> 04:05:53,710
I didn't think it would be that long.

2608
04:05:57,110 --> 04:06:00,870
I didn't think it would take this long

2609
04:06:30,230 --> 04:06:39,270
Oh yeah I didn't finish my chocolate Let me finish my chocolate My 50-90, oh my god, my chocolate's melting.

2610
04:06:47,740 --> 04:06:48,860
I'm eating the...

2611
04:06:52,540 --> 04:06:53,060
Mmm.

2612
04:07:00,510 --> 04:07:04,110
I'm eating the Kinder Surprise.

2613
04:07:05,010 --> 04:07:07,230
Um, not the egg, but the little bars.

2614
04:07:07,350 --> 04:07:08,190
I love those bars.

2615
04:07:09,430 --> 04:07:10,890
Every time I...

2616
04:07:10,890 --> 04:07:11,850
I don't eat it often.

2617
04:07:12,610 --> 04:07:17,710
I just spoil myself if I feel what I deserve it.

2618
04:07:18,110 --> 04:07:19,510
Today I deserve it.

2619
04:07:20,710 --> 04:07:22,110
Today I deserve it.

2620
04:07:39,670 --> 04:07:40,090
Hmm.

2621
04:07:52,170 --> 04:07:53,550
How much longer till finals?

2622
04:07:55,830 --> 04:07:57,110
A lot longer.

2623
04:08:00,730 --> 04:08:02,670
Wait, did Team Brian win?

2624
04:08:04,070 --> 04:08:04,810
Wait, how?

2625
04:08:05,970 --> 04:08:06,930
Wait, what?

2626
04:08:09,070 --> 04:08:09,950
What happened?

2627
04:08:12,710 --> 04:08:13,850
No, they're still going.

2628
04:08:13,970 --> 04:08:14,170
Okay.

2629
04:08:15,150 --> 04:08:16,030
Oh, no, they still have one.

2630
04:08:16,050 --> 04:08:16,710
No, not even.

2631
04:08:16,790 --> 04:08:18,290
No, they haven't won yet.

2632
04:08:18,610 --> 04:08:20,190
That's to hit 50 points, guys.

2633
04:08:20,270 --> 04:08:21,070
They haven't won yet.

2634
04:08:21,190 --> 04:08:21,470
No.

2635
04:08:24,940 --> 04:08:25,420
No.

2636
04:08:25,740 --> 04:08:27,420
They just need one more game.

2637
04:08:27,620 --> 04:08:29,280
Team Brian just need a win.

2638
04:08:29,560 --> 04:08:30,320
One more game.

2639
04:08:30,900 --> 04:08:33,200
And then they advance.

2640
04:08:38,340 --> 04:08:38,820
Yeah.

2641
04:08:39,020 --> 04:08:39,940
It's 30-20.

2642
04:08:40,500 --> 04:08:41,460
I was gonna say, how?

2643
04:08:43,900 --> 04:08:46,660
I was like, not how, I was like, how did Team Brian win?

2644
04:08:46,780 --> 04:08:52,100
But, like, I was like, I know I'm bad at math, but I'm pretty sure they still need to do another game.

2645
04:08:52,460 --> 04:08:53,260
Yeah, I was gonna...

2646
04:08:54,540 --> 04:08:57,860
Yeah, I was like, I was like, I'm pretty sure they have...

2647
04:08:57,860 --> 04:09:02,580
Even if they, Brian, Team, won that game, you have to do one more game.

2648
04:09:05,820 --> 04:09:08,020
So, yeah, that's why I was, like, so confused.

2649
04:09:08,120 --> 04:09:09,600
I was, like, what do you mean they won?

2650
04:09:10,020 --> 04:09:19,460
no they need 50 so literally team brian needs to win the next match and then they make it in and then they're in

2651
04:09:22,650 --> 04:09:57,290
i think i think team brian would advance just because like their team is actually pretty good but the one thing that um is holding them the one thing is that idom's team is a lot more um scarier it's a lot scarier versus uh um god it sucks to play zangief now look how slow he's walking over he's just slowly walking over intimately yeah

2652
04:10:02,790 --> 04:10:13,530
so wait this oh yeah they need two more games yeah brian needs two more games

2653
04:10:17,650 --> 04:10:48,490

04:11:01,930 --> 04:11:03,510
It's also Capcom's...

2656
04:11:03,510 --> 04:11:04,910
Wait, no, this is not the first time.

2657
04:11:05,470 --> 04:11:08,730
The last time they did this, it was three teams instead of...

04:11:08,730 --> 04:11:10,730
Yeah, bring out your freak fighters.

2659
04:11:11,190 --> 04:11:12,530

2752
04:20:22,810 --> 04:20:26,770

04:20:28,710 --> 04:20:30,750

Alright, you guys watch this.

2762
04:20:54,860 --> 04:20:56,780
I go watch other things.

2763
04:20:59,300 --> 04:20:59,740
Okay.

2764
04:21:20,960 --> 04:21:23,240
Why is that all...

2765
04:21:29,320 --> 04:21:30,760
I bet like...

2766
04:21:31,700 --> 04:21:33,860
I bet Sartina has been like...

2767
04:21:34,820 --> 04:21:36,020
Labbing against me.

2768
04:21:36,540 --> 04:21:38,140
And I'm just here...

2769
04:21:38,140 --> 04:21:39,400
Doom scrolling, Twitter.

2770
04:21:40,120 --> 04:21:46,420
I bet she's been labbing against me the last like hour or so.

2771
04:21:47,280 --> 04:21:48,620
Oh, she's not?

2772
04:21:50,400 --> 04:21:51,920
Is she or is she not?

2773
04:21:56,230 --> 04:21:57,870
She's much more dedicated.

2774
04:21:58,510 --> 04:21:59,970
Oh, she was labbing earlier?

2775
04:22:00,850 --> 04:22:05,490
I'll lab, I'll lab like an hour before, like I'll lab after the first game.

2776
04:22:08,110 --> 04:22:10,490
Just practicing how to parry headbutts.

2777
04:22:11,970 --> 04:22:14,310
Okay, that's good to know.

2778
04:22:15,250 --> 04:22:16,030
That's good to know.

2779
04:22:16,450 --> 04:22:17,930
She's gonna be so surprised.

2780
04:22:20,770 --> 04:22:22,950
Oh, for a bit, but not for a dog.

2781
04:22:25,350 --> 04:22:26,470
Oh, she was?

2782
04:22:26,570 --> 04:22:26,890
Okay.

2783
04:22:27,310 --> 04:22:30,610
I was gonna say, because I know she does a lot of labbing.

2784
04:22:35,320 --> 04:23:01,180
I like asked I remember like I asked my coaches, nephew and big bros like what do I do against these people and then they were like they you know they don't you know like usually a normal coach would like bring you to the custom room and then they like show you what you do against those people they wrote to me what to do and then I didn't retain any of that.

2785
04:23:06,160 --> 04:23:08,240
I didn't retake anything.

2786
04:23:08,800 --> 04:23:10,720
That's why I say I'm playing as I go.

2787
04:23:11,800 --> 04:23:13,460
I'm literally just playing as I go.

2788
04:23:24,660 --> 04:23:28,800
Because I was like, what do I do against like this?

2789
04:23:28,940 --> 04:23:31,140
And then they're like, oh, you do this, this, this.

2790
04:23:31,260 --> 04:23:32,460
I'm like, not a hotel.

2791
04:23:36,540 --> 04:23:37,720
But they don't know.

2792
04:23:37,740 --> 04:23:40,320
It was not no.

2793
04:23:40,800 --> 04:23:40,800
No,

2794
04:23:46,460 --> 04:23:47,320
not to hold on.

2795
04:23:47,540 --> 04:23:49,180
Yeah, it was not who hold on.

2796
04:23:50,000 --> 04:23:50,960
Not not who hold on.

2797
04:23:51,300 --> 04:23:51,860
I

2798
04:23:57,450 --> 04:23:59,790
see.

2799
04:24:00,070 --> 04:24:01,690
She doesn't see.

2800
04:24:04,590 --> 04:24:05,290
Jokes on them.

2801
04:24:05,390 --> 04:24:06,550
I don't know how to read.

2802
04:24:26,380 --> 04:24:26,940
Round two.

2803
04:24:27,200 --> 04:24:28,620
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2804
04:24:56,070 --> 04:24:57,370
Damn.

2805
04:25:01,790 --> 04:25:02,990
I looked over.

2806
04:25:03,930 --> 04:25:05,150
Oh, shit.

2807
04:25:06,730 --> 04:25:08,530
Fight back.

2808
04:25:14,710 --> 04:25:17,990
Fight back.

2809
04:25:54,010 --> 04:25:56,030
Yay, my...

2810
04:25:56,030 --> 04:25:57,450
You're still going?

2811
04:25:58,110 --> 04:25:58,350
Wait.

2812
04:26:00,170 --> 04:26:01,630
When does it end?

2813
04:26:02,270 --> 04:26:02,510
Wait.

2814
04:26:03,710 --> 04:26:04,850
Wait.

2815
04:26:05,290 --> 04:26:08,210
Wait, what's the score currently for them?

2816
04:26:12,480 --> 04:26:15,440
Oh, yeah, I forgot it, but sorry iPad kids.

2817
04:26:15,620 --> 04:26:16,800
I forgot to bring the pull.

2818
04:26:18,620 --> 04:26:19,640
There's an ending.

2819
04:26:19,740 --> 04:26:21,260
We'll do it for the next one.

2820
04:26:22,880 --> 04:26:24,000
Oh, it's 1-1?

2821
04:26:54,530 --> 04:26:54,930
Huh?

2822
04:27:19,550 --> 04:27:20,070

04:27:23,770 --> 04:27:25,870
Beautiful women wins again.

2826
04:27:27,770 --> 04:27:28,850
Damn, she was cooking.

2827
04:27:29,470 --> 04:27:29,690
Alright.

2828
04:27:30,330 --> 04:27:32,290
Oh man, we have to watch this.

2829
04:27:33,290 --> 04:27:36,210
Master Aki versus Master whatever he is.

2830
04:27:37,370 --> 04:27:40,870
He's not a cute girl, so like, I don't even know his name.

2831
04:27:41,670 --> 04:27:45,430
Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.

2832
04:27:46,010 --> 04:27:47,110
Oh my god.

2833
04:27:47,570 --> 04:27:48,510
Oh, okay, there you go.

2834
04:27:50,530 --> 04:27:58,510
DBC moment right here he can be we don't even know his name he's not a cute girl

2835
04:28:28,610 --> 04:28:34,510

2837
04:28:58,090 --> 04:28:59,970
Wait, how do you know I'm shaking my leg?

2838
04:29:01,390 --> 04:29:02,150
Wait, how do you guys know?

2839
04:29:06,580 --> 04:29:08,140
Are you talking about the game?

2840
04:29:15,050 --> 04:29:16,430
No, I'm going out, guys.

2841
04:29:16,710 --> 04:29:21,030
That's how motivated I am.

2842
04:29:21,090 --> 04:29:23,170
I'm going to go outside to the hot pot.

2843
04:29:29,710 --> 04:29:31,810
Oh, is it because I'm switching on screen?

2844
04:29:40,060 --> 04:29:41,140
Okay, yo.

2845
04:29:41,800 --> 04:29:44,300
I think my teammates are laughing.

2846
04:29:45,960 --> 04:29:46,040
Wait.

2847
04:29:47,240 --> 04:29:48,280
Are my teammates laughing?

2848
04:29:48,460 --> 04:29:49,800
I don't know.

2849
04:30:00,570 --> 04:30:02,950
As they should be.

2850
04:30:27,800 --> 04:30:28,580
Yay!

2851
04:30:29,100 --> 04:30:29,520
Yaki!

2852
04:30:30,640 --> 04:30:32,720
Beautiful women wins again.

2853
04:30:38,210 --> 04:30:39,170
Everyone trained.

2854
04:30:39,250 --> 04:30:41,010
Man, these memes are pretty funny.

2855
04:30:49,220 --> 04:30:50,200
Ta-girls.

2856
04:30:51,400 --> 04:30:53,600
Tiger, tiger, tiger.

2857
04:31:05,240 --> 04:31:07,560
I definitely will get coffee after this.

2858
04:31:07,780 --> 04:31:09,080
Wait, I'm going to check my coffee store.

2859
04:31:09,440 --> 04:31:10,780
My coffee shop is...

2860
04:31:10,780 --> 04:31:14,500
Because either that or I get Game Yourself's, but I'd rather just get coffee instead.

2861
04:31:15,380 --> 04:31:17,180
I think Game Yourself makes my heart...

2862
04:31:17,180 --> 04:31:22,260
Like, Game Yourself's good, but like, for that, it makes my heart be too fast when I'm anxious.

2863
04:31:22,940 --> 04:31:23,700
And I know I'm going to...

2864
04:31:23,700 --> 04:31:27,080
I know, like, even though I'm relaxed right now, I know I'll be anxious later.

2865
04:31:29,460 --> 04:31:32,500
doesn't get my heart beating that as fast as being yourselves.

2866
04:31:40,610 --> 04:31:41,690
That's just caffeine.

2867
04:31:42,270 --> 04:31:43,230
Caffeine just does that.

2868
04:31:44,410 --> 04:31:51,030
But the thing is, like, when I'm, you know, obviously, like, that's just what caffeine does in general.

2869
04:31:53,770 --> 04:31:57,670
Like, if I'm, like, like, you just get, like, zoned in, you know?

2870
04:31:59,150 --> 04:32:01,370
And, like, I'm an anxious person in general.

2871
04:32:01,370 --> 04:32:06,970
So, like, uh, so, like, I need, like, C-Man has entered the room.

2872
04:32:07,210 --> 04:32:14,930
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

2873
04:32:18,500 --> 04:32:18,620
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

2874
04:32:18,620 --> 04:32:19,780
Yo, let's go, C-Man.

2875
04:32:20,380 --> 04:32:22,880
Oh my god, the non-beautiful woman won?

2876
04:32:23,300 --> 04:32:24,200
What is this?

2877
04:32:24,600 --> 04:32:24,760
What?

2878
04:32:25,140 --> 04:32:27,680
What is this?

2879
04:32:28,420 --> 04:32:28,840
All right.

2880
04:32:30,080 --> 04:32:34,240
I don't know if, like, okay, should we watch an Iron Player versus a Platte?

2881
04:32:34,940 --> 04:32:36,580
Oh, we should watch this.

2882
04:32:37,220 --> 04:32:37,700

But there's a long line.

3091
04:53:15,240 --> 04:53:17,020
I also forgot about my laundry.

3092
04:53:17,260 --> 04:53:19,320
So I had to fix that.

3093
04:53:19,840 --> 04:53:22,280
I forgot about my laundry.

3094
04:53:25,220 --> 04:53:29,160
This is a Dragon TV show now.

04:53:29,560 --> 04:53:30,060

Bro, when do I have, when did I, oh my god, I had so many master players watching my stream.

3099
04:53:41,920 --> 04:53:45,540
Are you guys having fun watching whatever the heck I've been doing?

3100
04:53:46,060 --> 04:53:49,080
Like, hmm.

3101
04:53:53,420 --> 04:53:57,620
Also, I messed up and I asked for a hot caramel latte.

3102
04:53:58,180 --> 04:54:03,720
No, I asked for a caramel latte, but forgot to be specific and said iced caramel latte and they made it.

3103
04:54:03,820 --> 04:54:04,440
So I, you know.

3104
04:54:06,080 --> 04:54:12,520
They made it, so, um, so I was just like, oh, well, you're not in Aki!

3105
04:54:15,200 --> 04:54:17,940
I'm only fighting Aki's, guys.

3106
04:54:19,380 --> 04:54:21,940
Yeah, so it's a hot here, Malate.

3107
04:54:25,680 --> 04:54:28,540
No, ice is better because it's so hot in my room right now.

3108
04:54:32,150 --> 04:54:33,390
I'm hoping it kicks in.

3109
04:54:36,470 --> 04:54:36,830
Ah.

3110
04:54:37,030 --> 04:54:37,370
Ah.

3111
04:54:49,650 --> 04:54:51,730
That's right, they never dodged this for some reason.

3112
04:54:52,030 --> 04:54:53,150
I don't know why.

3113
04:55:00,810 --> 04:55:01,910
There we go.

3114
04:55:04,270 --> 04:55:05,030

It's okay, they're not watching, I think.

3117
04:55:11,590 --> 04:55:13,490
What I noticed is that she...

3118
04:55:13,490 --> 04:55:14,930
She grabs...

3119
04:55:14,930 --> 04:55:17,810
She grabs, like, after two strikes, which I've noticed.

3120
04:55:18,710 --> 04:55:19,090
Look at that.

04:56:27,120 --> 04:56:27,780
Oh, wait, he did.

3125
04:56:29,700 --> 04:56:31,580
I can't believe he expected that.

3126
04:56:34,780 --> 04:56:35,660
Get it.

3127
04:56:37,120 --> 04:56:38,000
Oh, my God.

3128
04:56:38,080 --> 04:56:39,180
He expected it.

3129
04:56:39,200 --> 04:56:40,160
Who would have thought?

3130
04:56:44,060 --> 04:56:45,240
No one expects this.

3131
04:56:45,420 --> 04:56:45,540
Oh.

3132
04:56:46,640 --> 04:56:47,460
Oh, my gosh.

3133
04:56:47,500 --> 04:56:49,940
When they start expecting it, it's like, what's the point, you know?

3134
04:56:54,080 --> 04:56:55,680
Oh, oh.

3135
04:56:56,740 --> 04:56:58,310
Ha ha ha ha!

3136
04:56:59,340 --> 04:56:59,420
Oh!

3137
04:57:01,680 --> 04:57:02,800
That's right.

3138
04:57:03,260 --> 04:57:05,900
Don't know why people don't expect that.

3139
04:57:06,920 --> 04:57:08,240
Makes me confused.

3140
04:57:08,720 --> 04:57:08,960
You know?

3141
04:57:10,680 --> 04:57:11,840
Oh, okay.

3142
04:57:12,200 --> 04:57:12,420
Unlucky.

3151
04:57:41,160 --> 04:57:42,900
Enough time to drink.

3152
04:57:48,910 --> 04:57:49,770
Fucking dirty.

3153
04:57:58,910 --> 04:58:00,710
It's cutscene time.

3154
04:58:07,530 --> 04:58:08,670
That's right.

3155
04:58:14,440 --> 04:58:15,980
Get out of here!

3156
04:58:20,700 --> 04:58:20,840
Oh.

3157
04:58:25,470 --> 04:58:26,670

3163
04:58:40,120 --> 04:58:41,700
I don't like it.

3164
04:58:49,260 --> 04:58:50,560

3165
04:58:50,720 --> 04:58:51,500
It makes me mad.

3166
04:58:53,920 --> 04:58:56,300
I don't like how slow he's playing.

3167
04:58:56,360 --> 04:58:56,840
All right.

3168
04:58:58,860 --> 04:59:00,000

04:59:16,430 --> 04:59:21,190
Guys, if you guys can play just like her, just like the Aki I'm playing against.

3173

My turn.

3185
05:00:39,510 --> 05:00:44,050

Enough time to drink.

3192
05:01:03,240 --> 05:01:04,420
Drink my coffee.

3193
05:01:07,680 --> 05:01:08,360

There you go.

3201
05:01:34,930 --> 05:01:38,290
I should have used the entire there.

3202
05:01:40,130 --> 05:01:43,850
I don't know why people don't do anything about that.

3203
05:01:52,480 --> 05:01:54,020
Oh my god.

3204
05:01:54,280 --> 05:01:55,480

I don't know.

3226
05:03:16,830 --> 05:03:17,970
Because we fought a diamond.

I didn't expect that.

3252
05:05:22,450 --> 05:05:22,710
No!

3253
05:05:25,250 --> 05:05:26,030
She would...

3254
05:05:26,030 --> 05:05:27,770
I can't believe she predicted it.

3255
05:05:27,790 --> 05:05:29,690
How could she know I would jump?

3256
05:05:30,130 --> 05:05:32,630
How- how did she know?

3257
05:05:36,090 --> 05:05:38,490
Also take a sip of your coffee.

3258
05:05:39,530 --> 05:05:43,290
Look, she is diamond, so me getting it that close, I take this.

3259
05:05:43,910 --> 05:05:46,010
The fact that it was that close, you know?

3260
05:05:48,510 --> 05:05:52,090
Oh Right

3261
05:05:56,390 --> 05:06:03,250
There you go Okay Oh my god.

3262
05:06:03,410 --> 05:06:04,750
I can't believe I got that block in.

3263
05:06:04,890 --> 05:06:05,690
I wasn't expecting that.

3264
05:06:09,590 --> 05:06:09,990
Oh.

3265
05:06:11,310 --> 05:06:11,710
Unlucky.

3266
05:06:13,710 --> 05:06:14,770
Get to the wall!

3267
05:06:15,190 --> 05:06:16,550
Get to the other side!

3268
05:06:18,450 --> 05:06:18,850
Okay.

3269
05:06:28,310 --> 05:06:28,710
Nice.

3270
05:06:31,050 --> 05:06:31,930
Oh my gosh.

3271
05:06:32,190 --> 05:06:32,390
Okay.

3272
05:06:33,390 --> 05:06:35,310
Ah, I knew she was gonna do that too.

3273
05:06:36,130 --> 05:06:36,450
There we go.

3274
05:06:36,530 --> 05:06:36,890
That's right.

3275
05:06:36,970 --> 05:06:37,670
You can't grab me a second.

3276
05:06:37,690 --> 05:07:06,710
second time unless like that mix up oh my gosh oh my god oh my god when does this combo end now I say when it's gonna end oh my gosh oh yes you missed oh my god yes not that's right no that's not right

3277
05:07:12,580 --> 05:07:15,340
Oh, that sounded like I thought I was close enough.

3278
05:07:20,360 --> 05:07:21,460
Oh my god, that's throw.

3279
05:07:21,700 --> 05:07:23,400
I need to remember when she does the jab.

3280
05:07:24,140 --> 05:07:25,680
She wants to throw me.

3281
05:07:27,380 --> 05:07:27,900
Oh my god.

3282
05:07:32,330 --> 05:07:32,670
Okay.

3283
05:07:38,370 --> 05:07:40,330
Oh, no, I could have antedited that.

3284
05:07:40,530 --> 05:07:41,070
That's fine.

3285
05:07:41,430 --> 05:07:42,290
Could attempt, you know.

3286
05:07:46,250 --> 05:07:47,750
I got punished.

3287
05:07:49,830 --> 05:07:50,610
Alright, let me see.

3288
05:07:50,670 --> 05:07:58,830

3291
05:08:24,150 --> 05:08:26,450
Oh, this is so close, guys.

3292
05:08:27,390 --> 05:08:28,250
This is so close.

3293
05:08:28,390 --> 05:08:30,790
But his Japanese curry wins this, like...

3294
05:08:30,790 --> 05:08:31,790
Oh, no.

3295
05:08:31,930 --> 05:08:32,530
He's choking.

3296
05:08:33,070 --> 05:08:33,830
Oh, no.

3297
05:08:34,470 --> 05:08:35,270
Oh, no.

3298
05:08:35,450 --> 05:08:36,630
Oh, don't.

3299
05:08:36,730 --> 05:08:38,070
Oh, he don't.

3300
05:08:38,110 --> 05:08:38,590
No.

3301
05:08:39,090 --> 05:08:40,310
Oh, there we go.

3302
05:08:40,430 --> 05:08:41,090
There we go.

3303
05:08:41,190 --> 05:08:42,210
It's one-to-one.

3304
05:08:43,470 --> 05:08:44,150
All right.

3305
05:08:44,390 --> 05:08:45,650
Who do I fight next?

3306
05:08:48,150 --> 05:08:48,870
All right.

3307
05:08:49,070 --> 05:08:50,010
Get in here.

3308
05:08:50,130 --> 05:08:50,650
Okay.

3309
05:08:51,490 --> 05:08:52,710
Play like your...

3310
05:08:52,710 --> 05:08:53,930
Play like your...

3311
05:08:59,330 --> 05:09:00,610
That's a nice Aki skin.

3312
05:09:00,790 --> 05:09:01,500
I like this one.

3313
05:09:03,530 --> 05:09:04,730
I think I like this Aki skin.

3314
05:09:05,530 --> 05:09:05,970
Almost.

3315
05:09:07,310 --> 05:09:08,830
No, he has to win one more set.

3316
05:09:18,910 --> 05:09:20,230
Oh my gosh, okay.

3317
05:09:20,970 --> 05:09:21,770
Okay, I didn't...

3318
05:09:21,770 --> 05:09:22,730
Oh my god, okay.

3319
05:09:22,990 --> 05:09:23,430
That's fine.

3320
05:09:26,350 --> 05:09:26,810
Next!

3321
05:09:27,210 --> 05:09:27,930
Your turn!

3322
05:09:29,730 --> 05:09:30,410
There we go.

3323
05:09:30,850 --> 05:09:31,450
There we go.

3324
05:09:35,070 --> 05:09:45,500
my oh nice my turn oh my turn that's right

3325
05:09:50,270 --> 05:10:08,590
yeah wait bp lost already oh what how did he lose already that was so fast no that's what i'm saying i'm saying like um Aiton's team is just a lot better.

3326
05:10:09,330 --> 05:10:11,370
Like, the teammates they got.

3327
05:10:12,670 --> 05:10:13,970
I think it doesn't help that.

3328
05:10:14,310 --> 05:10:15,630
Yeah, it's like...

3329
05:10:17,550 --> 05:10:18,770
I think it doesn't help.

3330
05:10:18,870 --> 05:10:22,510
Okay, what I think Brian's team has, like, the debuff on.

3331
05:10:23,010 --> 05:10:23,310
Is that...

3332
05:10:23,310 --> 05:10:24,210
Sorry, I'm like...

3333
05:10:24,210 --> 05:10:31,010
Okay, is that majority of Brian's teammates are also in the Seijom Slam.

3334
05:10:31,510 --> 05:10:33,230
So they have to divide their practice.

3335
05:10:35,930 --> 05:10:39,090
that's the only that's the unfortunate thing yeah

3336
05:10:44,690 --> 05:11:07,810
like majority of the um everyone like i think like three of the teammates are um three of them are around the 2x ko and i think 2x ko is a lot harder to train for okay bro bro bro bro i'm talking to my chat

3337
05:11:10,830 --> 05:11:16,870
chill i was bro chill bro what am i how how do i live how

3338
05:11:21,030 --> 05:12:06,940
i don't think i don't think serenity that could do that bro i i said play like her now play like yourself i didn't say play i don't i did not say i said play like her i said play like her bro i don't think 13 knows how to do all that bro i don't you don't know that i don't know this this combo was crazy uh like that's a crazy combo get me Here,

3339
05:12:07,040 --> 05:12:07,320
let's see.

3340
05:12:07,380 --> 05:12:08,820
I want to see this matchup.

3341
05:12:10,100 --> 05:12:11,960
That was a fast brawl pro game.

3342
05:12:19,560 --> 05:12:19,580
Hmm.

3343
05:12:20,760 --> 05:12:22,360
Okay, Brian F is...

3344
05:12:22,360 --> 05:12:24,680
Oh my god, the...

3345
05:12:24,680 --> 05:12:27,420
The thing is, I know Fumi...

3346
05:12:27,420 --> 05:12:31,760
I think Fumi is the scarier JP player.

3347
05:12:31,980 --> 05:12:34,140
She has the most experience, I'm pretty sure.

3348
05:12:38,890 --> 05:12:41,370
Yeah, I know 100% Fumi has the more...

3349
05:12:41,390 --> 05:12:45,570
Yeah, I think, I think, I think Fumi is gonna win it.

3350
05:12:45,730 --> 05:12:50,490
I don't think, because like Shumi started as a beginner, right?

3351
05:12:51,090 --> 05:12:55,030
But Fumi, when we did Seijam Slam, she was already a higher tier.

3352
05:12:59,960 --> 05:13:00,300
Yeah.

3353
05:13:07,370 --> 05:13:09,490
Isn't Fumi in the second tier?

3354
05:13:10,390 --> 05:13:12,190
Wait, she's in second tier then?

3355
05:13:12,450 --> 05:13:13,730
Wait, why is she in second tier?

3356
05:13:15,570 --> 05:13:17,990
She was like third tier in Seijam Slam.

3357
05:13:23,710 --> 05:13:25,810
yeah shouldn't she be in third tier

3358
05:13:34,730 --> 05:13:59,970
and i was like i'm confused how she got de-ranked a tier no 100 no item is progressing don't forget to warm up yeah but we still have a time though all right new challenger we still have time i don't want to like do too much um labbing just because like if i do too much um would get like,

3359
05:14:00,130 --> 05:14:04,170
I would get like too bad of, like I would get too much bad habits.

3360
05:14:07,090 --> 05:14:07,610
That's the thing.

3361
05:14:07,690 --> 05:14:09,290
I don't want to get too much bad habits.

3362
05:14:11,310 --> 05:14:13,510
Because everyone has like a different play style, you know?

3363
05:14:16,210 --> 05:14:17,270
Bro, I thought I was beginner.

3364
05:14:17,450 --> 05:14:25,430
You can't, no, you don't understand, I thought I was beginner because I, I even, I even didn't, I even like practice less than I should.

3365
05:14:29,470 --> 05:14:30,350
Oh my gosh.

3366
05:14:34,060 --> 05:14:34,540
Oh.

3367
05:14:36,600 --> 05:14:38,120
Oh, I was gonna grab that.

3368
05:14:39,680 --> 05:14:40,160
What?

3369
05:14:40,260 --> 05:14:41,460
I grabbed you first!

3370
05:14:42,380 --> 05:14:43,040
Oh my god.

3371
05:14:43,680 --> 05:14:44,740
You're not doing this.

3372
05:14:45,580 --> 05:14:46,260
To me.

3373
05:14:46,720 --> 05:14:47,380
That's right.

3374
05:14:49,240 --> 05:14:49,920
Oh, wait.

3375
05:14:50,100 --> 05:14:50,620
Oh my gosh.

3376
05:14:54,280 --> 05:14:54,860
That's right.

3377
05:14:54,900 --> 05:14:55,960
You don't expect that, do you?

3378
05:14:56,460 --> 05:14:57,580
No one ever does.

3379
05:15:01,160 --> 05:15:02,480
Oh, I did that too late.

3380
05:15:06,330 --> 05:15:06,370
Oh.

3381
05:15:16,090 --> 05:15:16,850
Oh, no.

3382
05:15:16,990 --> 05:15:18,990
He just slowly walked up to me and grabbed me.

3383
05:15:19,130 --> 05:15:19,590
That's illegal.

3384
05:15:21,450 --> 05:15:22,450
Bro, stop grabbing me.

3385
05:15:22,590 --> 05:15:23,450
I don't like that.

3386
05:15:25,630 --> 05:15:26,010
What?

3387
05:15:26,210 --> 05:15:27,270
That should be mine.

3388
05:15:32,570 --> 05:15:33,250
There you go.

3389
05:15:37,940 --> 05:15:38,420
There you go.

3390
05:15:41,560 --> 05:15:43,340
No one ever expects this move.

3391
05:15:47,580 --> 05:15:48,340
But I'm just one.

3392
05:15:48,460 --> 05:15:49,920
I'm not surprised, like I said.

3393
05:15:50,460 --> 05:15:51,660
It's going to be the same matchup.

3394
05:15:54,560 --> 05:15:56,960
I'm not surprised that that was the matchup.

3395
05:16:01,770 --> 05:16:02,010
Oh.

3396
05:16:05,860 --> 05:16:06,620
There we go.

3397
05:16:06,700 --> 05:16:07,760
Get out of here!

3398
05:16:10,780 --> 05:16:15,620
Like I said, like, I know Idom's team was the best player, the best the team.

3399
05:16:15,640 --> 05:16:16,760
to be worried about.

3400
05:16:23,690 --> 05:16:24,450
That's the thing.

3401
05:16:25,050 --> 05:16:26,730
Brian's team just had...

3402
05:16:26,730 --> 05:16:28,290
Brian's team just had all...

3403
05:16:28,290 --> 05:16:30,390
Majority of them were just at the other...

3404
05:16:30,390 --> 05:16:31,270
The 2xKO tournament.

3405
05:16:31,490 --> 05:16:32,030
They spent...

3406
05:16:32,030 --> 05:16:32,770
They had to learn a new...

3407
05:16:32,770 --> 05:16:34,410
A lot of them had to learn a new game, too.

3408
05:16:36,290 --> 05:16:37,670
So they had to split practice.

3409
05:16:38,190 --> 05:16:39,030
While, like...

3410
05:16:39,030 --> 05:16:40,870
I think, like, IDOM's team...

3411
05:16:40,870 --> 05:16:42,050
Some of them aren't...

3412
05:16:42,050 --> 05:16:44,570
Some of them aren't in the...

3413
05:16:44,570 --> 05:16:48,050
So, have the advantage of being able to just practice...

3414
05:16:48,070 --> 05:16:48,870
Street Fighter.

3415
05:16:56,320 --> 05:16:58,440
There you go.

3416
05:17:02,930 --> 05:17:03,210
Oh.

3417
05:17:04,010 --> 05:17:06,550
I wanted to butch slam, but I messed it up.

3418
05:17:11,550 --> 05:17:12,730
I don't care what I messed it up.

3419
05:17:12,850 --> 05:17:13,930
I got to do butch slam.

3420
05:17:15,690 --> 05:17:16,170
What?

3421
05:17:16,530 --> 05:17:18,570
Oh, I didn't press the thingy.

3422
05:17:20,370 --> 05:17:22,090
I hate it when they do the grab.

3423
05:17:22,390 --> 05:17:23,090
It's not cool.

3424
05:17:27,800 --> 05:17:29,580
It'll be a shame if I...

3425
05:17:29,580 --> 05:17:30,040
The start!

3426
05:17:30,820 --> 05:17:31,260
Oh

3427
05:17:34,820 --> 05:17:37,340
That's right my turn that's right my turn

3428
05:17:43,090 --> 05:17:49,330
Oh, no, oh no not my turn anymore What oh my god, yo bro.

3429
05:17:49,490 --> 05:17:58,670
I'm I'm not getting over there bro what oh What oh that was smart

3430
05:18:02,190 --> 05:18:03,250
What did I do?

3431
05:18:03,390 --> 05:18:03,690
Oh wait

3432
05:18:06,730 --> 05:18:08,550
Guys, I bet you I'm gonna do that.

3433
05:18:08,730 --> 05:18:11,650
I'm gonna do that in the Seretina matchup again.

3434
05:18:12,970 --> 05:18:14,870
Oh my god, it took one mistake.

3435
05:18:15,810 --> 05:18:16,610
Oh my god.

3436
05:18:16,990 --> 05:18:19,410
Oh my god, get me out of this hellhole.

3437
05:18:19,610 --> 05:18:20,450
Get me out of here.

3438
05:18:20,950 --> 05:18:21,670
Get me out of here.

3439
05:18:21,730 --> 05:18:23,370
At least I'm not in the corner, guys.

3440
05:18:28,670 --> 05:18:29,430
That's fine.

3441
05:18:29,730 --> 05:18:30,190
That's fine.

3442
05:18:33,210 --> 05:18:34,770
Oh wait, I wasn't supposed to...

3443
05:18:34,790 --> 05:18:35,390
Okay, whatever.

3444
05:18:36,490 --> 05:18:37,970
I'm supposed to do another...

3445
05:18:37,970 --> 05:18:39,630
I'll try and do that.

3446
05:18:42,310 --> 05:18:43,390
There we go.

3447
05:18:51,700 --> 05:18:52,760
Oh, I did it too early.

3448
05:18:53,840 --> 05:18:54,420
That's right.

3449
05:18:59,450 --> 05:19:01,090
That's right, nobody ever expects that!

3450
05:19:02,010 --> 05:19:02,730
For some reason!

3451
05:19:03,190 --> 05:19:04,110
I don't know why.

3452
05:19:05,450 --> 05:19:06,610
But I'll take those.

3453
05:19:08,370 --> 05:19:09,650
Oh my god, I got in the corner.

3454
05:19:13,630 --> 05:19:13,990
Boom!

3455
05:19:19,170 --> 05:19:23,710
No, I know I was gonna fight that team.

3456
05:19:23,830 --> 05:19:26,170
Like I said, I'm not surprised at all.

3457
05:19:29,470 --> 05:19:30,190
Oh, whoops.

3458
05:19:33,150 --> 05:19:33,430
Oh, no.

3459
05:19:34,330 --> 05:19:35,770
Not the grab.

3460
05:19:38,930 --> 05:19:40,750
That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it!

3461
05:19:41,150 --> 05:19:41,670
That's it!

3462
05:19:43,910 --> 05:19:45,190
It's fine, I'm not in the corner.

3463
05:19:47,290 --> 05:19:48,290
I take those.

3464
05:19:50,670 --> 05:19:51,650
It's fine, I take those.

3465
05:19:51,790 --> 05:19:52,670
I got out of the corner.

3466
05:19:53,950 --> 05:19:54,270
Yeah, I know.

3467
05:19:54,370 --> 05:19:55,270
They're going to have a time to...

3468
05:20:00,130 --> 05:20:01,190
They would tell me.

3469
05:20:04,830 --> 05:20:06,810
They would tell me whenever it's my turn.

3470
05:20:09,050 --> 05:20:09,450
What?

3471
05:20:10,270 --> 05:20:10,670
What?

3472
05:20:21,590 --> 05:20:23,990
You know, see, I'm starting to get tired now, too, from labbing.

3473
05:20:24,650 --> 05:20:26,030
So, I think this would be the last one.

3474
05:20:28,970 --> 05:20:30,490
That's why I didn't want to lab too much.

3475
05:20:34,150 --> 05:20:36,150
Like I said, I can tell when I...

3476
05:20:36,150 --> 05:20:37,450
When I started to get tired.

3477
05:20:43,470 --> 05:20:44,070
There we go.

3478
05:20:44,110 --> 05:20:45,130
Get... Oh, my God.

3479
05:20:48,570 --> 05:20:49,210
Oh, no.

3480
05:20:49,410 --> 05:20:50,210
No, not the punish.

3481
05:20:50,330 --> 05:20:50,590
No!

3482
05:20:51,110 --> 05:20:51,410
No!

3483
05:20:54,330 --> 05:20:56,450
Oh, I thought I'd get it first.

3484
05:20:57,330 --> 05:20:58,030
All right.

3485
05:20:59,330 --> 05:21:01,970
Oh, wait, I definitely forgot about that good thing.

3486
05:21:02,350 --> 05:21:04,690
All right, we're going to stop allowing me now.

3487
05:21:04,790 --> 05:21:05,450
I'm tired.

3488
05:21:08,690 --> 05:21:11,090
I feel myself getting tired.

3489
05:21:15,590 --> 05:21:17,590
All right, we'll watch a game.

3490
05:21:18,230 --> 05:21:18,930
We'll watch a game.

3491
05:21:19,510 --> 05:21:20,250
All right, we'll watch.

3492
05:21:21,690 --> 05:21:22,510
Who do we watch?

3493
05:21:22,510 --> 05:21:23,370
We'll watch this game.

3494
05:21:23,770 --> 05:21:25,070
Or you guys will watch this game.

3495
05:21:31,070 --> 05:21:36,950

05:24:00,860 --> 05:24:02,360
No, no, no, no, no, no.

3505
05:24:03,520 --> 05:24:05,920
It won't be as exciting to watch.

3506
05:24:06,360 --> 05:24:07,920
We all want to watch Feisty play.

3507
05:24:08,500 --> 05:24:09,100
Three rounds.

3508
05:24:10,720 --> 05:24:11,680
Oh, God, stop.

3509
05:24:13,280 --> 05:24:15,020
Nobody wants to see that.

3510
05:24:16,160 --> 05:24:17,040
Not even me.

3511
05:24:18,280 --> 05:24:19,720
It's okay, I believe.

3512
05:24:20,220 --> 05:24:21,520
We all want to see it.

3513
05:24:26,150 --> 05:24:26,970
Oh, God, man.

3514
05:24:26,970 --> 05:24:28,690
I just joined Parky's training and dropped it.

3515
05:24:28,990 --> 05:24:29,350
Why not?

3516
05:24:30,530 --> 05:24:31,490
Yeah, you could do that.

3517
05:24:34,310 --> 05:24:36,070
No, me and Kirkure are buddies.

3518
05:24:36,730 --> 05:24:37,950
He asked me to teach him TFT.

3519
05:24:38,390 --> 05:24:39,370
Guys, no, don't me.

3520
05:24:39,490 --> 05:24:41,330
Guys, I cannot be around three, guys.

3521
05:24:41,570 --> 05:24:42,370
Don't do this to me.

3522
05:24:43,250 --> 05:24:44,810
I'm too EP, guys.

3523
05:24:45,850 --> 05:24:48,370
I remember he was just asking a question on the bus.

3524
05:24:48,870 --> 05:24:49,110
Yeah.

3525
05:24:49,710 --> 05:24:53,450
He just, that team didn't even really care about Street Fighter, just kept asking me a question about TFT.

3526
05:24:53,810 --> 05:24:54,230
It was funny.

3527
05:24:55,030 --> 05:24:56,990
Look at Idom on Honda right now.

3528
05:24:57,330 --> 05:24:58,750
They were definitely practicing.

3529
05:25:00,550 --> 05:25:03,350
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.

3530
05:25:05,190 --> 05:25:05,850
But it's okay.

3531
05:25:07,030 --> 05:25:08,230
We got this.

3532
05:25:11,290 --> 05:25:13,510
So I can't wait for my hot pot, guys.

3533
05:25:14,350 --> 05:25:16,170
So I'm thinking about the hot pot.

3534
05:25:16,810 --> 05:25:16,990
Yeah.

3535
05:25:21,030 --> 05:25:22,070
Round two.

3536
05:25:23,310 --> 05:25:23,630
Fight.

3537
05:25:26,050 --> 05:25:26,650
Too.

3538
05:25:26,650 --> 05:25:29,230
you said

3539
05:25:33,380 --> 05:26:01,320
he was waking up headbutt uh like wake up ex headbutt he was waking up ex headbutt yeah okay you grabbed a lot of them yeah it has armor so like it'll beat your button but if you grab it like your grapple wins he also drive reversal once um so if you want to try beating both of you just walk back the knockdown and just got he's not working yeah guys i Guys,

3540
05:26:01,360 --> 05:26:04,380
I think the coffee was a really bad idea.

3541
05:26:06,720 --> 05:26:10,840
Guys, the coffee was a bad idea.

3542
05:26:14,760 --> 05:26:17,020
Guys, the eyes are getting heavy.

3543
05:26:17,460 --> 05:26:19,940
It's basically like, because it has armor, so it comes like...

3544
05:26:19,940 --> 05:26:20,300
Wash my face.

3545
05:26:20,360 --> 05:26:21,660
Okay, I'm going to wash my face a little.

3546
05:26:22,580 --> 05:26:25,060
Guys, my eyes are getting tired.

3547
05:26:27,880 --> 05:26:29,780
Grab the EX head, bud.

3548
05:26:30,800 --> 05:26:32,700
I'm going to go wash my face real quick, guys.

3549
05:26:34,380 --> 05:26:34,860
Okay.

3550
05:26:38,980 --> 05:26:39,460
All

3551
05:26:52,920 --> 05:26:53,400
right.

3552
05:27:12,530 --> 05:27:18,210
So is it a bad idea, you think, then, to, like, if I get the notch down to wake up Meady?

3553
05:27:19,590 --> 05:27:23,870
You can do it sometimes, but, like, maybe.

3554
05:27:24,490 --> 05:27:26,870
How long has Teary been fighting for it?

3555
05:27:28,270 --> 05:27:28,790
Grabber.

3556
05:27:28,970 --> 05:27:29,450
Okay.

3557
05:27:30,730 --> 05:27:32,350
How long did he be fighting for?

3558
05:27:35,090 --> 05:27:36,010
Oh, no.

3559
05:27:39,290 --> 05:27:41,370
I've just been casually sipping it.

3560
05:27:45,900 --> 05:27:46,760
Oh, my God.

3561
05:27:51,600 --> 05:27:52,320
How many rounds do I have?

3562
05:27:52,480 --> 05:27:54,720
This guy's on a 10-game win streak.

3563
05:27:54,800 --> 05:27:56,640
Who will defeat the Terry?

3564
05:27:58,620 --> 05:27:59,660
Guys, this...

3565
05:27:59,860 --> 05:28:02,320
Terry has been on a 10-game win streak.

3566
05:28:07,510 --> 05:28:07,870
Alright, guys.

3567
05:28:07,990 --> 05:28:10,450
We gotta move on to the next player after this.

3568
05:28:10,690 --> 05:28:10,970
Alright.

3569
05:28:11,490 --> 05:28:12,590
Terry, stay in.

3570
05:28:12,890 --> 05:28:14,010
Ooh, someone challenged.

3571
05:28:14,170 --> 05:28:15,830
Someone break Terry's win streak.

3572
05:28:19,650 --> 05:28:22,010
Wait, I think the vice is gonna beat it.

3573
05:28:27,330 --> 05:28:31,770
Guys, I think, like, for this bracket, I'm gonna stop commentating.

3574
05:28:32,570 --> 05:28:34,670
I'm actually getting tired.

3575
05:28:37,450 --> 05:28:48,230
I didn't think it would be this long I really didn't think I need to save my energy for my bracket

3576
05:28:52,670 --> 05:29:44,490
why am I match for wait what wait I thought I'm I'm second wait why am I match for yeah you're last nice you can warm up i said but i said second please you got this oh it's okay it's the same thing don't worry there's a realistic chance it's like you play last and then you'll play immediately right after again oh my god stop it yeah yeah yeah all right it's time time to end this tournament as much as i know you guys want to stick around for a few more hours we got it Now I'm getting hot pot after this.

3577

It's been great.

3578
05:29:46,390 --> 05:29:46,870
It's been great.

3579
05:29:47,450 --> 05:29:48,050
Alright.

3580
05:29:48,970 --> 05:29:49,850

Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.

3582
05:29:53,390 --> 05:29:59,350
We're gonna go look for invites, I assume.

3583
05:29:59,830 --> 05:30:00,990
Yeah, we got our invite.

3584
05:30:03,370 --> 05:30:05,350
Why am I last again?

3585
05:30:05,550 --> 05:30:07,110
This is not fair.

3586
05:30:08,250 --> 05:30:10,310
It's actually not fair.

3587
05:30:13,680 --> 05:30:15,820
Wait, they already started playing?

3588
05:30:18,420 --> 05:30:19,040
Nice.

3589
05:30:23,860 --> 05:30:25,220
When did they start?

3590
05:30:26,260 --> 05:30:28,040
I wasn't even in the lobby.

3591
05:30:28,820 --> 05:30:28,900
All

3592
05:30:32,380 --> 05:30:34,760
right.

3593
05:30:35,300 --> 05:30:44,130

05:30:44,470 --> 05:30:49,410

05:31:39,230 --> 05:31:41,170

3608
05:31:44,350 --> 05:31:45,010

3615
05:32:03,250 --> 05:32:06,170
I hate JV so much.

3616
05:32:06,650 --> 05:32:09,230
We're losing here at a JP ASMR.

3617
05:32:13,570 --> 05:32:16,630
This gives me more energy when I do the MP.

3618
05:32:17,250 --> 05:32:20,770
Bro, what if I just do JP ASMR?

3619

3624
05:33:06,320 --> 05:33:06,780
Whoa.

3625
05:33:07,960 --> 05:33:09,420

That's new.

3629
05:33:13,220 --> 05:33:14,420
He started laughing.

3630
05:33:14,540 --> 05:33:15,780
I've never seen that before.

3631
05:33:17,720 --> 05:33:19,880
I was like, wait a minute, I've never heard that lie.

3632
05:33:20,520 --> 05:33:21,840
Now, observe this.

3633
05:33:21,920 --> 05:33:22,560
No, now.

3634
05:33:23,040 --> 05:33:23,420
Observe this.

3635
05:33:23,500 --> 05:33:24,200
Now, no.

3636
05:33:24,620 --> 05:33:25,120
Observe this.

3637
05:33:25,340 --> 05:33:25,720
Here.

3638
05:33:27,680 --> 05:33:30,280
I was like, that laugh was new.

3639
05:33:31,940 --> 05:33:32,560
JP laughs?

3640
05:33:32,800 --> 05:33:33,060
I know.

3641
05:33:33,300 --> 05:33:33,960
I was like, what?

3642
05:33:34,580 --> 05:33:36,140
I've never seen this before.

3643
05:33:36,640 --> 05:33:36,880
Here.

3644
05:33:37,340 --> 05:33:37,600
No.

3645
05:33:37,920 --> 05:33:38,560
Observe this.

3646
05:33:38,600 --> 05:33:38,820
Here.

3647
05:33:38,900 --> 05:33:39,180
No.

3648
05:33:39,460 --> 05:33:39,580
Now.

3649
05:33:39,640 --> 05:33:40,300
Observe this.

3650
05:33:40,620 --> 05:33:40,620
Here.

3651
05:33:42,920 --> 05:33:44,040
God, please.

3652
05:33:44,880 --> 05:33:47,780
We should really have a day where we ban JP.

3653
05:33:50,720 --> 05:33:51,880
new sound

3654
05:33:58,050 --> 05:34:08,390
jesus bro well if she's in the corner especially she's gonna teleport through the portal to try and get out

3655
05:34:11,650 --> 05:34:26,090
yeah that was a crazy grab that was a good mix up i will admit that what the did you hear me at capcom Fan JP for a day and you'll see an increase of player base.

3656
05:34:27,630 --> 05:34:28,610
Do you like money?

3657
05:34:29,010 --> 05:34:30,610
We like money here.

3658
05:34:34,090 --> 05:34:36,050
Well, here.

3659
05:34:37,010 --> 05:34:37,270
Whoa.

3660
05:34:38,070 --> 05:34:42,470
Now, honestly, if they...

3661
05:34:42,470 --> 05:34:49,730
I hope they see it and they're like, wait, we can make so much money if we just do like character bands every week or so.

3662
05:34:50,150 --> 05:34:51,750
Oh, it's like the Overwatch thing.

3663
05:34:51,810 --> 05:34:52,230
Remember in Overwatch?

3664
05:34:52,250 --> 05:34:55,870
Overwatch, they did like hero bans where like you're not allowed to play certain character.

3665
05:34:56,070 --> 05:34:57,250
Jesus, what am I?

3666
05:35:02,750 --> 05:35:09,190
Where they basically like did the thing where you can't play a certain character for rank and stuff.

3667
05:35:09,610 --> 05:35:10,610
We should do that.

3668
05:35:11,110 --> 05:35:11,670
Oh, goodbye.

3669
05:35:13,470 --> 05:35:15,330
Just careful of those command grabs up close.

3670
05:35:15,490 --> 05:35:20,910
And when you're in mid-range, you can just chill a bit and look for buttons to drive us or charge up fireballs.

3671
05:35:23,150 --> 05:35:25,410
How would they explain JP's removal?

3672
05:35:25,590 --> 05:35:26,490
He's old!

3673
05:35:29,090 --> 05:35:31,010
That's how you can explain it.

3674
05:35:34,190 --> 05:35:35,330
Bro, he's old.

3675
05:35:35,610 --> 05:35:38,250
He's got to take his medication or some shit.

3676
05:35:39,110 --> 05:35:43,370
Do you want some fireballs?

3677
05:35:43,710 --> 05:35:44,710
I think he would grab his back.

3678
05:35:49,100 --> 05:35:49,840
Dodge this.

3679
05:35:50,540 --> 05:35:52,920
Dodge this.

3680
05:35:53,900 --> 05:35:55,060
Bro, what am I watching?

3681
05:36:01,420 --> 05:36:02,060
No!

3682
05:36:02,540 --> 05:36:03,180
Watch this!

3683
05:36:03,700 --> 05:36:03,700
Now!

3684
05:36:09,750 --> 05:36:10,390
Like...

3685
05:36:10,390 --> 05:36:12,710
Now I understand why people are depressed.

3686
05:36:13,970 --> 05:36:19,850
I have to play this character in Rink all the time.

3687
05:36:20,110 --> 05:36:21,610
Now I know.

3688
05:36:23,570 --> 05:36:25,690
Now I know why people in Street Fighter.

3689
05:36:26,010 --> 05:36:26,310
Bro!

3690
05:36:26,830 --> 05:36:27,210
Bro!

3691
05:36:32,270 --> 05:36:32,910
Okay.

3692
05:36:38,640 --> 05:36:40,260
Now observe.

3693
05:36:40,760 --> 05:36:40,760
Here.

3694
05:36:42,100 --> 05:36:42,100
Here.

3695
05:36:58,390 --> 05:36:59,450
I...

3696
05:36:59,450 --> 05:37:00,450
Nice.

3697
05:37:01,310 --> 05:37:01,890
Good patience.

3698
05:37:02,170 --> 05:37:04,330
Oh, that was insane prediction.

3699
05:37:05,210 --> 05:37:08,210
That really was insane prediction there.

3700
05:37:11,430 --> 05:37:14,300
No, I'm watching this is...

3701
05:37:15,710 --> 05:37:18,890
I'm depressed watching this JP.

3702
05:37:20,050 --> 05:37:22,630
Watching JP in general is depressing.

3703
05:37:23,870 --> 05:37:27,470
It's, I'll say, it's not even fun to watch.

3704
05:37:29,870 --> 05:37:32,270
I wish it was fun to watch, but it's not.

3705
05:37:39,930 --> 05:37:41,530
Like, how do you counter that?

3706
05:37:41,750 --> 05:37:43,650
You don't have draft.

3707
05:37:44,290 --> 05:37:48,910
It feels like there's nothing you can do.

3708
05:37:57,440 --> 05:37:57,860
Like, how?

3709
05:37:58,000 --> 05:37:58,660
How do you have fun?

3710
05:37:58,680 --> 05:38:01,660
How is this fun?

3711
05:38:04,980 --> 05:38:06,600
I don't find this fun to watch.

3712
05:38:06,640 --> 05:38:07,040
I'm sorry.

3713
05:38:07,180 --> 05:38:09,200
I don't find this fun to watch at all.

3714
05:38:09,820 --> 05:38:12,560
It is absolutely not fun to watch.

3715
05:38:13,340 --> 05:38:17,020
I'm like tilted watching this as someone that's not even playing.

3716
05:38:17,540 --> 05:38:17,780
That's okay.

3717
05:38:17,900 --> 05:38:19,680
Don't worry about it.

3718
05:38:26,490 --> 05:38:27,450
Now observe.

3719
05:38:32,620 --> 05:38:35,280
Like, even if I have have a JP on my team.

3720
05:38:35,520 --> 05:38:36,800
I don't think this is fun though.

3721
05:38:37,440 --> 05:38:39,540
I would be like, I hate you.

3722
05:38:39,840 --> 05:38:41,840
You're on my team and I hate you.

3723
05:38:43,640 --> 05:38:47,340
I feel sorry for Emily that she has to play against this.

3724
05:38:52,420 --> 05:38:53,020
Bro.

3725
05:38:54,620 --> 05:38:58,840
I thank God there's no JP in your level.

3726
05:39:01,160 --> 05:39:01,900
Thank God.

3727
05:39:07,270 --> 05:39:10,990
Like, you have to be, like, 24-7 active.

3728
05:39:11,010 --> 05:39:11,930
Let me try.

3729
05:39:12,670 --> 05:39:13,070
NT.

3730
05:39:16,090 --> 05:39:16,710
Nice try.

3731
05:39:17,510 --> 05:39:17,810
That was good.

3732
05:39:17,990 --> 05:39:18,370
That was good.

3733
05:39:20,470 --> 05:39:22,770
And you just, like, you'll win next time.

3734
05:39:23,390 --> 05:39:24,150
Yeah, it's just, like, you'll win next time.

3735
05:39:24,150 --> 05:39:26,810
Yeah, it's just anytime you get close to your command grab and it puts you full screen.

3736
05:39:27,170 --> 05:39:30,310
So if you can jump them, then you'll win for sure.

3737
05:39:34,220 --> 05:39:35,600
Yeah, absolutely interfering.

3738
05:39:35,800 --> 05:39:36,740
Yeah, it's just that block.

3739
05:39:36,800 --> 05:39:37,060
All right.

3740
05:39:37,180 --> 05:39:37,920
I ain't about that.

3741
05:39:38,280 --> 05:39:41,520

05:41:33,830 --> 05:41:35,090
I jinxed him.

3749
05:41:38,530 --> 05:41:39,410
Let's not go!

3750
05:41:39,490 --> 05:41:40,090
Let's not go!

I take it back!

3752
05:41:41,330 --> 05:41:42,210
Let's not go!

3753
05:41:42,730 --> 05:41:43,450
Let's not go!

3754
05:41:43,650 --> 05:41:44,150
I'm sorry!

3755
05:41:45,790 --> 05:41:46,090
Yeah.

3756
05:41:46,830 --> 05:41:47,970
I wouldn't jump at him.

3757
05:41:48,010 --> 05:41:49,130
Let's go, Karku!

3758
05:41:49,630 --> 05:41:49,810
Let's go!

3759
05:41:49,950 --> 05:41:52,590
Let's focus on that.

3760
05:41:56,070 --> 05:41:57,370
Let's go, Karku!

3761
05:41:57,930 --> 05:41:59,570
I reversed jinxed it.

3762
05:42:01,670 --> 05:42:04,570
This is your thought, Toki.

3763
05:42:05,590 --> 05:42:08,590
I said

3764
05:42:11,690 --> 05:42:13,190
yes, I would was funny.

3765
05:42:13,630 --> 05:42:16,170
I didn't realize it's not being funny.

3766
05:42:19,190 --> 05:42:21,290
What have you done?

3767
05:42:34,770 --> 05:42:35,770
I think that was funny.

3768
05:42:36,450 --> 05:42:37,370
Oh no, that's not good.

3769
05:42:41,210 --> 05:42:41,570
Oh.

3770
05:42:41,910 --> 05:42:42,210
Oh.

3771
05:42:42,210 --> 05:42:42,630
Oh.

3772
05:42:42,630 --> 05:42:43,010
Oh.

3773
05:42:43,030 --> 05:42:44,410
Oh, that was clutch.

3774
05:42:44,710 --> 05:42:45,590
Oh my god, you're the GOAT.

3775
05:42:46,150 --> 05:42:46,970
That was so clutch.

3776
05:42:47,430 --> 05:42:51,790
Don't be afraid to wake up with super sometimes because you're not really baiting it, I don't think.

3777
05:42:52,530 --> 05:42:53,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3778
05:42:53,970 --> 05:42:54,670
Okay, okay.

3779
05:42:56,230 --> 05:42:58,190
See, I told you, I reversed Jinx to chat.

3780
05:42:58,210 --> 05:42:58,830
Let me call him back for a sec.

3781
05:43:16,560 --> 05:43:17,680
Oh my god.

3782
05:43:17,880 --> 05:43:18,040
What?

3783
05:43:18,180 --> 05:43:18,660
Where am I?

3784
05:43:18,920 --> 05:43:19,260
Whoa.

3785
05:43:21,340 --> 05:43:21,740
Whoa.

3786
05:43:23,220 --> 05:43:23,620
Whoa.

3787
05:43:24,860 --> 05:43:25,220
Yo!

3788
05:43:31,900 --> 05:43:33,280
Let's go, Karaku.

3789
05:43:34,540 --> 05:43:36,020
I'm doing it, I'm jinxing him.

3790
05:43:36,420 --> 05:43:38,360
See, oh, um...

3791
05:43:38,880 --> 05:43:39,220
Punish?

3792
05:43:44,690 --> 05:43:45,150
Nice.

3793
05:43:46,790 --> 05:43:48,690
No perfect here.

3794
05:43:51,590 --> 05:43:52,310
Oh no.

3795
05:43:53,250 --> 05:43:53,930
Not this row.

3796
05:43:54,970 --> 05:43:56,790
What the heck is that move?

3797
05:43:58,490 --> 05:44:00,190
That's like, yeah.

3798
05:44:00,670 --> 05:44:01,110
What is that?

3799
05:44:01,290 --> 05:44:03,590
I would just drive rush cross me and punch the eye.

3800
05:44:04,290 --> 05:44:06,370
You know how like the coach is like, I would do this and this.

3801
05:44:07,670 --> 05:44:10,530
I saw it when he was like, do speed dash and I was like, what the?

3802
05:44:11,270 --> 05:44:11,770
Got him.

3803
05:44:12,310 --> 05:44:12,550
All right.

3804
05:44:12,710 --> 05:44:12,950
Nice.

3805
05:44:13,310 --> 05:44:13,750
Nice.

3806
05:44:14,170 --> 05:44:14,730
Let's go.

3807
05:44:15,250 --> 05:44:15,950
Let's go.

3808
05:44:17,450 --> 05:44:17,930
All right.

3809
05:44:19,270 --> 05:44:19,710
Yay.

3810
05:44:20,510 --> 05:44:22,290
That means I can lose my game.

3811
05:44:23,050 --> 05:44:23,350
All right.

3812
05:44:23,370 --> 05:44:23,610
All right.

3813
05:44:24,110 --> 05:44:24,410
All right.

3814
05:44:26,710 --> 05:44:27,590
All right.

3815
05:44:27,650 --> 05:44:28,230
All right.

3816
05:44:28,230 --> 05:44:29,030
best in your hands.

3817
05:44:29,730 --> 05:44:30,450
I'm good for 10.

3818
05:44:33,170 --> 05:44:35,030
Oh, is that move not available in modern?

3819
05:44:35,550 --> 05:44:36,430
I was like, what is that?

3820
05:44:36,610 --> 05:44:40,610
Not only my coach nephew, but my other side coach in the chat, automatic.

3821
05:44:40,930 --> 05:44:43,170
That guy also taught me a lot about being fired.

3822
05:44:44,750 --> 05:44:45,950
Oh, my God.

3823
05:44:47,270 --> 05:44:48,790
I'll get my water in.

3824
05:44:51,010 --> 05:44:52,590
No, it's first to 70.

3825
05:44:52,870 --> 05:44:54,490
Remember, you can stand up and pick him a lot.

3826
05:44:54,790 --> 05:44:55,250
70.

3827
05:44:58,230 --> 05:45:21,170
and you probably can still jump at him and i probably can still drive rush in your life yeah yeah i think so and that's why i'm like show maxing i was like whatever happens i'm heading to i'm clocking out whatever happens is clock out out hours

3828
05:45:44,810 --> 05:45:52,230
yeah less commentary from me right now just because like i'm conserving energy i'm like I didn't do that.

3829
05:45:57,530 --> 05:45:57,530
Whoa!

3830
05:45:58,310 --> 05:45:58,310
Oh!

3831
05:45:58,850 --> 05:46:00,030
Wait, that's crazy!

3832
05:46:03,950 --> 05:46:05,350
That's a crazy move.

3833
05:46:06,090 --> 05:46:06,090
Whoa!

3834
05:46:14,180 --> 05:46:15,620
Yeah, she's cooking.

3835
05:46:23,030 --> 05:46:25,150
Damn, Faisy is insane at this game.

3836
05:46:26,930 --> 05:46:27,490
Wow.

3837
05:46:27,890 --> 05:46:33,150
I don't think everyone else... I know, like, the Aki can do parries, but...

3838
05:46:34,190 --> 05:46:36,210
we're not here for that

3839
05:46:41,910 --> 05:46:55,590
that's why she's the 20 point exactly that's crazy she has to win two more sets that's the hard part about being a 20 pointer wow

3840
05:47:00,120 --> 05:47:12,310
oh my god oh and she forgot the that thing goes what am i what what is going on what

05:47:31,310 --> 05:47:34,810

3845
05:48:19,440 --> 05:48:21,840
I think from farther away you can probably jump.

3846
05:48:21,960 --> 05:48:23,280
That's the...

3847
05:48:23,280 --> 05:48:25,100
I was like, what is that name?

3848
05:48:26,260 --> 05:48:26,560
Okay.

3849
05:48:36,400 --> 05:48:38,840
Oh my god, what a read!

3850
05:48:39,260 --> 05:48:40,100
That's crazy.

3851
05:48:42,080 --> 05:48:44,040
That's a crazy read.

3852
05:48:51,200 --> 05:48:53,040
Fuck, I should have done the dash back.

3853
05:48:53,220 --> 05:48:53,740
Oh, that's fine.

3854
05:48:55,820 --> 05:48:56,860
Well, get off of it.

3855
05:49:07,790 --> 05:49:08,670
Nice.

3856
05:49:12,170 --> 05:49:13,110
You're doing insane.

Thank you.

3858

Thank you.

3859
05:49:16,870 --> 05:49:17,530
All right.

3860
05:49:18,830 --> 05:49:20,710
Let's go Japanese curry.

3861
05:49:28,250 --> 05:49:31,470
I told you this reverse jinx works, guys.

3862
05:49:37,040 --> 05:49:37,920

3863
05:49:39,240 --> 05:49:40,560
I proclaim oopsies.

3864
05:49:47,820 --> 05:49:49,780

3868
05:50:34,980 --> 05:50:35,900
How dare he?

3869
05:50:40,470 --> 05:50:41,550
Oh no.

3870
05:50:42,970 --> 05:50:45,210
Oh, combo time.

Oh my god!

05:50:52,750 --> 05:50:54,170
Oh, that's crazy!

3874
05:50:54,450 --> 05:50:56,490
You see, this is why you're the 20-pointer, not me.

3875
05:50:59,330 --> 05:51:00,610
This is why you're the 20-pointer.

3876
05:51:01,250 --> 05:51:02,390
Oh my god.

3877
05:51:03,330 --> 05:51:04,310
That was so good.

3878
05:51:06,310 --> 05:51:07,510
That was so good.

3879
05:51:08,510 --> 05:51:09,110
Okay.

3880
05:51:09,610 --> 05:51:10,410
Oh my god.

3881
05:51:10,710 --> 05:51:11,590
Now I'm sorry.

3882
05:51:12,010 --> 05:51:12,190
Thank you.

3883
05:51:13,510 --> 05:51:15,110
This is my turn.

3884
05:51:15,530 --> 05:51:15,670
Okay.

3885
05:51:15,770 --> 05:51:17,870
I will admit guys, I am getting EP.

3886
05:51:19,310 --> 05:51:20,750
They are too.

3887
05:51:20,870 --> 05:51:22,930
It's a battle of attrition at this point.

3888
05:51:24,070 --> 05:51:24,890
More like who wants it.

3889
05:51:26,150 --> 05:51:27,850
I'm a bit EP guys.

3890
05:51:28,130 --> 05:51:29,390
I don't know about wanting.

3891
05:51:29,750 --> 05:51:30,530
You got this.

3892
05:51:30,630 --> 05:51:31,010
Please.

3893
05:51:31,390 --> 05:51:32,330
You got this.

3894
05:51:32,830 --> 05:51:33,210
You're good.

3895
05:51:33,790 --> 05:51:35,350
Your butt slender are doing really good.

3896
05:51:35,630 --> 05:51:36,850
And your auto heavies up close.

3897
05:51:37,910 --> 05:51:38,270
Yep.

3898
05:51:44,970 --> 05:51:45,730
Shake it out.

3899
05:51:46,590 --> 05:51:47,490
I'm going to stand up, actually.

3900
05:51:47,550 --> 05:51:48,630
I've been sitting for way too long.

3901
05:51:51,290 --> 05:51:52,490
Why is she not joining?

3902
05:51:54,030 --> 05:51:54,590
Are we waiting?

3903
05:51:54,810 --> 05:51:55,910
She's literally asleep in the chair.

3904
05:51:57,150 --> 05:51:58,810
I was like, what are we waiting for right now?

3905
05:51:59,330 --> 05:52:00,690
Wait, Dan, you wake up early, right?

3906
05:52:00,690 --> 05:52:01,630
What time did you wake up?

3907
05:52:02,830 --> 05:52:03,230
Yeah.

3908
05:52:03,530 --> 05:52:05,010
Like, my son wakes up at 6 a.m.

3909
05:52:05,030 --> 05:52:05,550
every day.

3910
05:52:05,730 --> 05:52:06,630
Oh, okay, no, me too.

3911
05:52:06,810 --> 05:52:12,210
I mean, not my son, but like, I don't have a secret son out there.

3912
05:52:12,610 --> 05:52:13,070
I see.

3913
05:52:13,750 --> 05:52:14,930
She got a son with a...

3914
05:52:14,930 --> 05:52:15,850
You rent those, too?

3915
05:52:16,110 --> 05:52:17,490
Yeah, that's how I rent a son.

3916
05:52:23,090 --> 05:52:24,230
Oh, my gosh.

3917
05:52:26,510 --> 05:52:29,770
Oh, the grab.

3918
05:52:30,510 --> 05:52:31,550
Wait, she knows.

3919
05:52:32,850 --> 05:52:33,410
Oh,

3920
05:52:37,860 --> 05:52:38,160
no.

3921
05:52:41,180 --> 05:52:42,720
Wait, she downloaded me.

3922
05:52:44,380 --> 05:52:44,760
Unless.

3923
05:52:58,550 --> 05:53:00,310
Oh, I'm sorry.

3924
05:53:00,590 --> 05:53:02,290
I want to do that charge for the headbutt.

3925
05:53:02,930 --> 05:53:05,750
And, like, sometimes you can do EX headbutt when you're getting pressured.

3926
05:53:06,710 --> 05:53:06,750
Yeah.

3927
05:53:09,450 --> 05:53:10,230
There you go.

3928
05:53:14,410 --> 05:53:14,810
Oh.

3929
05:53:16,030 --> 05:53:19,290
Only when you're getting pressure though, you don't want to do it on screen.

3930
05:53:20,230 --> 05:53:20,370
Oh.

3931
05:53:23,410 --> 05:53:23,810
Whoops.

3932
05:53:24,290 --> 05:53:25,750
I know you just said that, but.

3933
05:53:26,010 --> 05:53:26,230
That's fine.

3934
05:53:26,330 --> 05:53:26,790
That's fine.

3935
05:53:46,780 --> 05:53:47,860
I'll play a lot slower.

3936
05:53:48,820 --> 05:53:49,000
Yeah.

3937
05:53:49,140 --> 05:53:49,340
I'll play a lot slower.

3938
05:53:49,800 --> 05:53:53,880
Yeah, when you have the life fleet, you can just sit back, hold your charge and head, but...

3939
05:54:02,370 --> 05:54:02,690
Oh.

3940
05:54:02,690 --> 05:54:02,970
Nice punish.

3941
05:54:15,250 --> 05:54:15,690
Nice.

3942
05:54:18,090 --> 05:54:18,510
Oh.

3943
05:54:19,430 --> 05:54:20,090
That's fine.

3944
05:54:21,630 --> 05:54:22,730
That's like no damage.

3945
05:54:29,850 --> 05:54:30,630
I like that.

3946
05:54:39,370 --> 05:54:41,210
Oh, I knew she was going to grab too.

3947
05:54:41,490 --> 05:54:43,730
If she gets close, you can do your L3 super.

3948
05:54:47,550 --> 05:54:49,690
You can also just hold charge and try and butt slam.

3949
05:54:53,720 --> 05:54:56,860
Oh, I knew she.

3950
05:55:08,610 --> 05:55:09,570
Oh, that's fine.

3951
05:55:11,070 --> 05:55:12,670
If she goes ahead, you can hit that button.

3952
05:55:13,270 --> 05:55:13,990
Oh, nice.

3953
05:55:15,810 --> 05:55:17,410
She's making you play more passive.

3954
05:55:17,630 --> 05:55:18,690
I don't like it.

3955
05:55:19,270 --> 05:55:21,750
Yeah, just if you have the life bleed, you can play super passive.

3956
05:55:23,210 --> 05:55:24,410
Wait, what's that?

3957
05:55:25,030 --> 05:55:27,310
You want more life than her?

3958
05:55:31,730 --> 05:55:32,090
Yeah.

3959
05:55:35,590 --> 05:55:35,950
Nice.

3960
05:55:38,250 --> 05:55:40,290
Now just make sure you don't get jumped in on.

3961
05:55:40,530 --> 05:55:42,010
If she jumps at you, you headbutt.

3962
05:55:42,670 --> 05:55:42,850
Okay.

3963
05:55:43,930 --> 05:55:46,530
Because you have such a big life bleed, you don't need to really worry about anything.

3964
05:55:49,470 --> 05:55:49,830
Okay.

3965
05:55:50,070 --> 05:55:50,290
Okay.

3966
05:55:50,290 --> 05:55:50,530
What?

3967
05:55:50,950 --> 05:55:50,950
Oh.

3968
05:55:54,310 --> 05:55:55,150
Okay, not anymore.

3969
05:55:56,930 --> 05:55:57,530
Well, you still got it.

3970
05:55:57,570 --> 05:55:58,090
He was like, weird.

3971
05:56:05,870 --> 05:56:07,910
I mean, like, do a grab on that.

3972
05:56:09,130 --> 05:56:09,390
I'm sure.

3973
05:56:11,530 --> 05:56:16,030
Yeah, just make sure not to do the EX head, but unless, like, she's really close to you.

3974
05:56:23,090 --> 05:56:23,490
This?

3975
05:56:25,910 --> 05:56:26,310
Oh.

3976
05:56:26,670 --> 05:56:28,750
I want to do the grab.

3977
05:56:32,770 --> 05:56:33,130
Unlucky.

3978
05:56:38,230 --> 05:56:38,590
Nice.

3979
05:57:03,290 --> 05:57:04,670
Can I just hold your charge?

3980
05:57:04,970 --> 05:57:05,250
Oh!

3981
05:57:06,570 --> 05:57:07,190
I got you again.

3982
05:57:07,290 --> 05:57:08,970
Hold your charge and you can EX head by if she gets close.

3983
05:57:09,770 --> 05:57:09,990
Okay.

3984
05:57:13,330 --> 05:57:36,250
there you go nice nice nice dude you're cooking okay she's making me play so slow i don't like it i hate playing slow no but if you play slow you can win i know but i'm so bad with i'm like really bad with slow gameplay that's

3985
05:57:40,300 --> 05:57:44,180
my one weakness and she knows because i have to do that for

3986
05:57:50,430 --> 05:57:55,710
Yeah, have your finger on the L3 button and just press it if she gets close.

3987
05:57:58,210 --> 05:57:58,930
Nice.

3988
05:58:00,170 --> 05:58:01,870
Stop playing so slow!

3989
05:58:02,310 --> 05:58:02,670
Nice timing.

3990
05:58:13,770 --> 05:58:14,030
Oh.

3991
05:58:14,390 --> 05:58:15,710
She always does that too.

3992
05:58:16,210 --> 05:58:17,670
I need to like be aware.

3993
05:58:19,230 --> 05:58:19,530
Oh.

3994
05:58:26,300 --> 05:58:27,020
Oh.

3995
05:58:34,210 --> 05:58:34,930
What?

3996
05:58:34,950 --> 05:58:35,090
What?

3997
05:58:36,390 --> 05:58:36,390
Okay.

3998
05:58:44,210 --> 05:58:44,470
Hmm.

3999
05:58:53,870 --> 05:58:54,170
Nice.

4000
05:58:56,050 --> 05:58:59,290
Just try and land your auto heavy somewhere else.

4001
05:59:02,640 --> 05:59:04,300
Oh, I heard auto heavy.

4002
05:59:04,820 --> 05:59:06,020
Yeah, that was a good try.

4003
05:59:06,260 --> 05:59:07,320
Yeah, you had to go for it, I think.

4004
05:59:08,160 --> 05:59:08,380
It's okay.

4005
05:59:08,420 --> 05:59:11,400
You have all your meter for this round, so if you land a big hit, it'll do a lot.

4006
05:59:12,340 --> 05:59:12,600
Oh.

4007
05:59:13,580 --> 05:59:13,940
Oh.

4008
05:59:14,140 --> 05:59:14,500
Oh.

4009
05:59:15,120 --> 05:59:15,480
Oh.

4010
05:59:15,620 --> 05:59:15,980
Oh.

4011
05:59:17,900 --> 05:59:18,280
Stop.

4012
05:59:23,600 --> 05:59:24,120
Like that shot?

4013
05:59:24,400 --> 05:59:24,620
Okay.

4014
05:59:26,800 --> 05:59:30,900
And then just hold back and if she jumps or does anything you can hide but...

4015
05:59:30,900 --> 05:59:32,080
Do I need a special head player?

4016
05:59:33,180 --> 05:59:34,560
Yeah, the regular one.

4017
05:59:35,320 --> 05:59:36,220
Not a special head.

4018
05:59:37,400 --> 05:59:38,580
Okay, that works for me.

4019
05:59:40,060 --> 05:59:40,880
I'll just sit there.

4020
05:59:41,060 --> 05:59:41,540
Oh, what?

4021
05:59:41,700 --> 05:59:41,840
Oh!

4022
05:59:43,500 --> 05:59:45,240
Yeah, make sure you're not holding down.

4023
05:59:45,420 --> 05:59:45,700
Okay.

4024
05:59:46,580 --> 05:59:47,500
Okay, you just need one more.

4025
05:59:47,500 --> 06:00:17,060
if you could just charge for butt slam that'd be good okay oh wait that's i didn't want to do that that was an accident but i didn't yeah it's fine i don't care let's go i did it it doesn't matter all right that was great okay god she made me adapt i hate that that's so stupid yeah that's the worst part that's the worst part i said

4026
06:00:20,220 --> 06:00:24,840
Just play how you usually play and we'll do rock, paper, scissors.

4027
06:00:28,420 --> 06:00:30,000
Guys, I hate adapting.

4028
06:00:32,920 --> 06:00:34,960
Guys, I have to think.

4029
06:00:35,280 --> 06:00:36,480
I'm the EP too.

4030
06:00:38,160 --> 06:00:38,800
We're at 40, yeah.

4031
06:00:39,560 --> 06:00:40,760
I'm also EP.

4032
06:00:41,480 --> 06:00:42,640
They have 10.

4033
06:00:42,920 --> 06:00:44,020
They have 10.

4034
06:00:44,380 --> 06:00:44,660
They have 10.

4035
06:00:44,660 --> 06:00:45,500
Dude, dude.

4036
06:00:45,640 --> 06:00:47,480
I'm pretty sure I'm gonna do this.

4037
06:00:47,500 --> 06:01:34,480
double points it's just you've got to jump the command grabs that's the only thing yeah jump the command they need to make it a different color it's not my fault the sound cue where he goes away you have to like instinctively press up in that situation if he just says away yeah all right that can be you don't even have to react literally just hold up when you see him do that specific button i'll stay in the spectate every time off of it i'm gonna relax a bit now oh uh doke you're gonna be playing immediately wait what yeah they have you playing that's not fair i demand um second they're having you play again it's all good bro

4038
06:01:41,260 --> 06:02:47,840
no time to relax i mean honestly i mean you could go into training mode just have jp do it like 15 times you'll never like not hear no no neffy already did it to me like a hundred times oh yeah just you could try you could like just not react and just hold up when you're getting in oh my bro i just wanted to chill you're doing great you're doing great yeah one minute at a time don't worry about anything one minute i think it's just with jp there's like too many things to focus on but like i guess i'll prioritize the command grab else like you're doing good at blocking every bullshit that he does like you're you're fine wait did you ever take the risk and just like jump over the double portals in the air or no not really oh i i can't because we're on the away side i have to be on the right for fair for fairness apparently but maybe like when you do because when you see the double portals i see you do like dry rush just relax what is that button medium kick yeah or heavy kick you could

4039
06:02:47,840 --> 06:03:45,540
do like drive rush throw can she do that yeah you could do that yeah i think i need to drive us throw more is what i was thinking too yeah like when instead of because she's not really like trying to attack at that point she's just waiting for you to to do your heavy kick and then just wait yeah so yeah you should just throw her more okay and then once you like start throwing her she's probably gonna start doing the the counter thing the amnesia where she sounds like a ghost of herself so like if you land a couple throws just mind she's gonna start doing that on reaction you guys can start this one or i guess well i'm just waiting i think they're giving her tips right now you know oh yeah they're giving her tips yeah i mean that was that was uh dokey not even holding back for the charge headbutt like they can adapt if you was the was the medium punch button on honda on modern she should do that more she did like that it's just medium Yeah.

4040
06:03:46,820 --> 06:03:50,440
But did you feel sure about the headbutt into EX headbutt tech?

4041
06:03:50,760 --> 06:03:50,860
What?

4042
06:03:52,080 --> 06:03:56,700
Yeah, you can do like regular headbutt into the EX headbutt because she always presses medium punch.

4043
06:03:57,400 --> 06:04:00,060
So if you do that on block, you can go straight into it.

4044
06:04:00,880 --> 06:04:04,120
Also if you're close to her, just keep mashing medium punch.

4045
06:04:04,580 --> 06:04:07,200
Oh, like, yeah, like she can't do anything.

4046
06:04:07,600 --> 06:04:09,200
Like if you keep just pressing it.

4047
06:04:09,200 --> 06:04:10,960
Like auto or no auto?

4048
06:04:11,360 --> 06:04:12,300
No auto either.

4049
06:04:12,440 --> 06:04:12,660
Oh, okay.

4050
06:04:13,140 --> 06:04:14,520
Or is it auto?

4051
06:04:15,300 --> 06:04:17,300
Guys, I'm getting overwhelmed right now.

4052
06:04:17,360 --> 06:04:18,660
Okay, I think maybe we're overwhelmed here.

4053
06:04:18,980 --> 06:04:19,380
Oh, no.

4054
06:04:19,700 --> 06:04:20,220
Oh, no.

4055
06:04:20,560 --> 06:04:22,160
I think what you were doing was good.

4056
06:04:22,640 --> 06:04:23,460
You're doing that.

4057
06:04:24,280 --> 06:04:26,260
Oh, guys, you overwhelmed me.

4058
06:04:28,940 --> 06:04:30,180
I told you.

4059
06:04:35,570 --> 06:04:36,570
This is not good.

4060
06:04:36,630 --> 06:04:37,390
I'm going on burnout.

4061
06:04:37,570 --> 06:04:38,030
I don't care.

4062
06:04:39,950 --> 06:04:40,730
Yeah, that's fine.

4063
06:04:47,670 --> 06:04:48,150
Nice.

4064
06:04:59,160 --> 06:05:00,980
Oh, she always grabs that.

4065
06:05:01,100 --> 06:05:01,740
I didn't even remember it.

4066
06:05:06,380 --> 06:05:06,720
Yay!

4067
06:05:07,220 --> 06:05:07,760
Nice jump.

4068
06:05:08,160 --> 06:05:08,400
Yeah!

4069
06:05:08,800 --> 06:05:09,480
Great jump.

4070
06:05:09,840 --> 06:05:09,920
Okay.

4071
06:05:13,940 --> 06:05:16,100
I don't know, we just have to do this.

4072
06:05:16,300 --> 06:05:23,170
I know you- oh wait, I grabbed first!

4073
06:05:23,810 --> 06:05:24,350
That could grab.

4074
06:05:27,230 --> 06:05:27,750
There we go.

4075
06:05:36,810 --> 06:05:37,890
There we go.

4076
06:05:38,550 --> 06:05:39,570
That might be dumb.

4077
06:05:39,590 --> 06:05:45,130
but i think if you land your auto have you one more time

4078
06:05:53,410 --> 06:06:04,970
that's right nobody expects that not even me all right nice nice you're so good at jumping over the fireballs yeah

4079
06:06:20,900 --> 06:06:21,580
I'm lucky.

4080
06:06:23,180 --> 06:06:23,520
It's fine.

4081
06:06:23,620 --> 06:06:24,180
I'll take that.

4082
06:06:32,940 --> 06:06:33,600
What would I do next?

4083
06:06:33,840 --> 06:06:34,400
Oh, that.

4084
06:06:36,220 --> 06:06:37,520
But what would I do after that?

4085
06:06:41,960 --> 06:06:42,360
Nice.

4086
06:06:42,720 --> 06:06:43,660
Oh, that's not nice.

4087
06:06:43,880 --> 06:06:45,500
No, no, nephew, you jinxed me.

4088
06:06:46,040 --> 06:06:47,040
Oh, you're good.

4089
06:06:50,740 --> 06:06:51,340
There we go.

4090
06:07:15,710 --> 06:07:16,970
Oh, unlucky.

4091
06:07:17,350 --> 06:07:18,870
I knew she was going to grab, too.

4092
06:07:21,730 --> 06:07:21,850
Oh.

4093
06:07:24,230 --> 06:07:25,470
I don't have a cutscene.

4094
06:07:25,870 --> 06:07:26,430
I do!

4095
06:07:28,770 --> 06:07:30,950
I got my cutscene.

4096
06:07:39,050 --> 06:07:41,910
Oh, unlucky.

4097
06:07:42,650 --> 06:07:43,710
That was so fast.

4098
06:07:45,450 --> 06:07:47,950
I was expecting that to be...

4099
06:07:48,110 --> 06:07:54,210
so fast oh i'm dead here that's fine she has no meter now

4100
06:07:58,110 --> 06:08:07,710
you try to bust them a bit more too but okay yeah but she's blocking it so it's fine if she blocks it's just sometimes it'll hit her by your ball and you're getting in off of it

4101
06:08:26,270 --> 06:08:28,270
oh that's that was poor type

4102
06:08:36,800 --> 06:08:38,120
Oh, unlucky.

4103
06:08:39,680 --> 06:08:41,620
Oh, I'm messing that up.

4104
06:08:42,340 --> 06:08:42,800
That's okay.

4105
06:08:44,560 --> 06:08:45,240
Nice.

4106
06:08:46,160 --> 06:08:48,080
Yeah, just try to keep her here.

4107
06:08:51,840 --> 06:08:52,520
Nice.

4108
06:08:54,500 --> 06:08:54,840
Yeah.

4109
06:09:00,330 --> 06:09:01,010
Nice.

4110
06:09:12,600 --> 06:09:13,820
Oh, that's unlucky.

4111
06:09:14,900 --> 06:09:15,780
Yeah, it's okay.

4112
06:09:18,720 --> 06:09:22,140
Yeah, just keep your charge and you can use that whenever she is close.

4113
06:09:22,440 --> 06:09:22,620
Oh, I tried.

4114
06:09:23,680 --> 06:09:25,340
You have to hold back though.

4115
06:09:25,600 --> 06:09:27,520
Oh, I did it again.

4116
06:09:32,970 --> 06:09:33,470
Ah!

4117
06:09:34,350 --> 06:09:35,950
I don't know how to counter that.

4118
06:09:41,160 --> 06:09:42,070
Yeah, I get in there.

4119
06:09:43,360 --> 06:09:43,940
Five seconds.

4120
06:09:44,660 --> 06:09:44,900
Oh.

4121
06:09:48,620 --> 06:10:10,680
Yeah, it's just when you have the light just like literally hold hold back yeah so that you always because you're getting hands instead of the heads up because you don't have enough back charge okay yeah but now you can try and get your auto heavy combos oh

4122
06:10:15,220 --> 06:10:16,300
she jumps

4123
06:10:30,760 --> 06:10:31,400
Okay.

4124
06:10:32,820 --> 06:10:32,920
Yeah.

4125
06:10:34,340 --> 06:10:34,980
Oh.

4126
06:10:40,530 --> 06:10:41,170
Nice.

4127
06:10:42,090 --> 06:10:43,370
Oh, that's unlucky.

4128
06:10:43,870 --> 06:10:45,050
She grabbed it.

4129
06:10:45,470 --> 06:10:45,970
That's okay.

4130
06:10:48,050 --> 06:10:49,770
Just press your L through anything.

4131
06:10:50,270 --> 06:10:50,490
Okay.

4132
06:10:51,670 --> 06:10:53,030
Oh, I pressed your L through.

4133
06:10:55,790 --> 06:10:56,430
Nice.

4134
06:10:56,870 --> 06:10:58,230
Train butsling or jump.

4135
06:10:58,590 --> 06:10:58,730
Aw.

4136
06:10:59,670 --> 06:11:00,350
I'm gonna try this way.

4137
06:11:01,590 --> 06:11:03,130
I try to jump that.

4138
06:11:03,190 --> 06:11:04,810
It's just so fast.

4139
06:11:05,170 --> 06:11:05,730
Yeah, it's fast.

4140
06:11:18,090 --> 06:11:18,810
Hmm.

4141
06:11:21,050 --> 06:11:21,590
Uh.

4142
06:11:23,190 --> 06:11:24,810
She adapted to me.

4143
06:11:25,830 --> 06:11:26,110
Okay.

4144
06:11:27,010 --> 06:11:28,790
I think I'm thinking too much, too.

4145
06:11:29,730 --> 06:11:30,930
I'm not vibing anymore.

4146
06:11:43,590 --> 06:11:45,870
Oh, this try, this try.

4147
06:11:46,130 --> 06:11:46,830
Almost.

4148
06:11:47,990 --> 06:11:53,390
nice try indeed it's okay you guys just went all of them now i can chill

4149
06:11:58,740 --> 06:12:09,060
all right uh yeah i yeah i got overloaded i think i was just it was better i think i got too overloaded

4150
06:12:12,920 --> 06:12:58,540
yeah it was just too much information in my head yeah we're gonna try to fire ball again but the thing is he sometimes just jumps in for the fireball so uh i think it's just like what do i do yeah i think yeah i got too much information anymore also i feel like when you're aggressive he just doesn't know what to do they gave so much information at once right before i started yeah he'd just be freaking out uh yeah they went over i said four moves guys four moves was like if it was like um they gave me as i went then it's fine but like the fact that like i had so much information in my head right before i started

4151
06:13:02,340 --> 06:13:11,420
yeah oh that's perfectly spaced

4152
06:13:15,180 --> 06:13:44,490
yeah i mean 4-1 was pretty good record it was a pretty good record i'm fine with that i'm fine with that record oh wait wait is he yeah i think okay oh okay oh okay yeah i was gonna say why didn't they timed out or the controller timed out okay no i said it's just he didn't block like the third hit

4153
06:13:52,250 --> 06:14:05,550
I'm just gonna relax a little I need to go back to vibing I need to go back to vibing so what did they do in the same sense uh he might have to restart his game or something yeah I restarted my game and it worked

4154
06:14:08,730 --> 06:14:17,050
I'm happy I won 4-1 was a good record yeah I was like I'm happy I did my fight there

4155
06:14:22,720 --> 06:14:48,080
and now I'm just testing all my buttons um 40 20 i think that's the score maybe just kill him oh yeah we started it yeah i think if i have to play another one um if i have to play another one uh i'm just gonna go back to my old strat yeah

4156
06:14:52,710 --> 06:15:22,290
because like um i just got too overloaded i was like i overthinking is like oh what do i do i do i'm happy i'm happy i'm happy with uh with being able to do it i have to do what i did okay yeah because like it worked and then they're like do this more and i was like well we both but my strat was working yeah i was just like they're like you should you should do this and then this and then this i was like but i was winning

4157
06:15:26,150 --> 06:15:27,790
I was like, was that not winning?

4158
06:15:32,610 --> 06:15:33,050
Yeah.

4159
06:15:41,670 --> 06:15:44,670
It was good advice, but my mind doesn't do well with that.

4160
06:15:45,850 --> 06:15:50,550
That's why I like it when people talk about random things, because, like, my mind doesn't overthink.

4161
06:15:53,130 --> 06:15:55,270
I mean, you guys are cool with it just being a restart, right?

4162
06:15:55,330 --> 06:15:55,790
Yeah, yeah.

4163
06:15:57,590 --> 06:15:59,210
Oh, you're like, yeah, we should.

4164
06:15:59,430 --> 06:16:04,530
Yeah, I get my mental is like, I always like, if I get too overloaded, my mental.

4165
06:16:04,550 --> 06:16:21,970
kill his day all over the place but like i did my i think i'm still happy with how i did yeah he basically didn't do anything yeah i'm joking i'm joking guys yeah yeah already starting i thought i thought they had to reset so i was chilling

4166
06:16:27,090 --> 06:16:39,350
don't expect me to be a pushover round one there's a lot of buns on my um dry brush Yeah, he does this.

4167
06:16:49,880 --> 06:16:51,320
Did he disconnect again?

4168
06:16:51,660 --> 06:16:54,100
Because as soon as he jittered and then...

4169
06:16:54,100 --> 06:16:54,520
What?

4170
06:16:55,000 --> 06:16:55,000
Okay.

4171
06:16:55,040 --> 06:16:56,460
As soon as he jittered and stopped doing stuff.

4172
06:16:57,240 --> 06:16:59,940
Do we have to reset the game again?

4173
06:17:01,120 --> 06:17:02,920
Like, what happens if he can't play?

4174
06:17:03,380 --> 06:17:06,000
Like, that would really fucking suck if they had to forfeit.

4175
06:17:06,940 --> 06:17:07,280
Yeah.

4176
06:17:08,220 --> 06:17:09,280
But it's like...

4177
06:17:13,380 --> 06:17:13,900
Yeah.

4178
06:17:19,430 --> 06:17:22,590
I think he's just reset his game because he didn't restart his game last time.

4179
06:17:22,730 --> 06:17:27,270
Yeah, I mean, he might be having issues with his PC and his game, so he might just reset.

4180
06:17:27,330 --> 06:17:29,550
I had to restart Street Fighter twice today, so...

4181
06:17:31,470 --> 06:17:33,770
The thing is, I don't know how long...

4182
06:17:33,770 --> 06:17:33,970
Street Fighter.

4183
06:17:34,930 --> 06:17:38,650
I'm just thinking, like, how long's the intermission?

4184
06:17:40,230 --> 06:17:44,790
Like, at some point we can't wait forever, I'm sorry.

4185
06:17:45,370 --> 06:17:46,230
I'm too tired.

4186
06:17:46,310 --> 06:17:47,990
I don't think I can last another...

4187
06:17:48,550 --> 06:17:49,770
two hours.

4188
06:17:51,470 --> 06:17:52,330
Yeah, same.

4189
06:17:52,910 --> 06:17:56,290
I'm also

4190
06:18:00,060 --> 06:18:00,740
pretty tired.

4191
06:18:01,740 --> 06:18:03,380
I'm using up all my juice.

4192
06:18:03,480 --> 06:18:04,360
I'm using all my juice.

4193
06:18:04,520 --> 06:18:05,300
I ended this series.

4194
06:18:05,480 --> 06:18:08,740
I drank coffee before we started the finals.

4195
06:18:11,560 --> 06:18:12,840
Oh my god.

4196
06:18:22,200 --> 06:18:23,700
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

4197
06:18:24,380 --> 06:18:25,660
I'm back starting to hurt.

4198
06:18:25,760 --> 06:18:26,420
I'm old.

4199
06:18:26,700 --> 06:18:27,560
Oh no.

4200
06:18:33,900 --> 06:18:36,040
I don't even know what's hurting anymore.

4201
06:18:36,400 --> 06:18:36,740
It's something.

4202
06:18:37,060 --> 06:18:38,060
I just don't know what.

4203
06:18:52,070 --> 06:18:54,410
This event is sabotaging the BJs.

4204
06:18:54,710 --> 06:18:56,070
Oh, I think I'm the last one.

4205
06:18:56,890 --> 06:18:57,110
Oh, no.

4206
06:18:57,210 --> 06:18:57,950
Actually, it's me and Fumi.

4207
06:18:58,690 --> 06:19:02,210
Kirk, you said he can forfeit the first round.

4208
06:19:02,650 --> 06:19:03,370
That sucks.

4209
06:19:04,950 --> 06:19:05,370
I don't know.

4210
06:19:05,510 --> 06:19:07,330
But I think it's like the production.

4211
06:19:07,770 --> 06:19:08,730
I don't think we can make that call.

4212
06:19:08,870 --> 06:19:09,970
It's like the ad music section.

4213
06:19:10,070 --> 06:19:12,110
Yeah, I was going to say the production makes the final call.

4214
06:19:13,390 --> 06:19:13,790
Yeah.

4215
06:19:16,990 --> 06:19:19,030
Going by, oh wait, it's 10 p.m.

4216
06:19:19,110 --> 06:19:19,650
Never mind.

4217
06:19:20,170 --> 06:19:22,730
If he's East Coast, I don't think he can get a controller.

4218
06:19:23,090 --> 06:19:23,850
10 p.m.

4219
06:19:24,190 --> 06:19:25,050
I don't think he can get a controller.

4220
06:19:25,050 --> 06:19:26,530
It's 1.22 for me.

4221
06:19:26,850 --> 06:19:29,530
Yeah, I feel like we should have started earlier.

4222
06:19:30,050 --> 06:19:31,310
Yeah, I think so.

4223
06:19:34,410 --> 06:19:36,730
I feel like this should have just been two days.

4224
06:19:37,170 --> 06:19:37,810
I think so, too.

4225
06:19:37,850 --> 06:19:39,490
The final should be on another day.

4226
06:19:39,930 --> 06:19:40,330
Yeah.

4227
06:19:41,090 --> 06:19:42,890
I think he couldn't because of the slam.

4228
06:19:43,670 --> 06:19:44,350
Oh, yeah, true.

4229
06:19:46,990 --> 06:19:51,630
it will also be like monday wait no it'll be sunday but uh

4230
06:20:03,400 --> 06:20:08,920
it needs to update the firmware did like they just pushed out a new update in between this game

4231
06:20:12,000 --> 06:20:30,760
uh that's crazy they're like a controller update okay well i will say i have some sympathy for it because i was having a couple of controller issues at twitch con uh and so i definitely have felt some of what he's talking about before

4232
06:20:49,350 --> 06:20:58,550
i think everyone's tired all the east coast people are mega tired bro he's at one hot pot

4233
06:21:21,760 --> 06:21:33,060
some of his buns are being held like uh red like they're held down i've had that before um as well so like i definitely know exactly what he's talking about i i know i don't know how to fix it, though.

4234
06:21:35,760 --> 06:21:38,820
At TwitchCon, what happened was, uh, it was not, it was not my mediums.

4235
06:21:38,880 --> 06:21:40,060
It was my directional keys.

4236
06:21:40,260 --> 06:21:42,640
I was, like, randomly holding jump at times.

4237
06:21:43,420 --> 06:21:49,800
And there was, like, times where I was, like, practicing with the rules, and on the PCs, I was, like, I let go of my control, and I was, like, jumping up for, I don't know, for no reason.

4238
06:21:52,380 --> 06:21:53,580
But do you also have the same controller?

4239
06:21:56,840 --> 06:21:57,120
Yeah.

4240
06:21:57,120 --> 06:22:02,260
Uh, we, uh, we all got, like, the same controller for the last Sage Amsamba that me and Karki played in.

4241
06:22:02,380 --> 06:22:08,940
because we got one we we got prizes for going top two I

4242
06:22:12,130 --> 06:22:22,850
actually have that controller too I'm happy I'm not using it right now it's a pretty sick controller it definitely has some weird things though

4243
06:22:46,500 --> 06:23:00,820
sorry I was zoning out guys I'm I'm zoning out guys just getting there it's just I'm just, let's see.

4244
06:23:02,540 --> 06:23:03,060
It's...

4245
06:23:03,060 --> 06:23:04,760
It's getting there.

4246
06:23:17,490 --> 06:23:17,650
Oh!

4247
06:23:21,310 --> 06:23:23,870
Apparently, it's not working for him.

4248
06:23:26,010 --> 06:23:29,470
Do you think he has to use, like, an Xbox controller?

4249
06:23:34,390 --> 06:23:37,450
I feel like there's no way he knows how to play on an Xbox controller.

4250
06:23:37,970 --> 06:23:38,490
Yeah.

4251
06:23:38,850 --> 06:23:40,050
I don't know if you'll have a backup.

4252
06:23:44,700 --> 06:23:45,220
Okay.

4253
06:23:45,240 --> 06:23:46,240
Oh, God.

4254
06:23:48,720 --> 06:23:49,760
I'm trying to stay locked in.

4255
06:23:50,140 --> 06:23:51,760
So rabbit tapping.

4256
06:23:53,220 --> 06:23:54,020
Pick PNG.

4257
06:23:55,820 --> 06:23:56,380
TikTok.

4258
06:23:59,340 --> 06:24:02,800
Wish I could post that picture in the group server without it being toxic.

4259
06:24:09,400 --> 06:24:11,500
Have you used your keyboard?

4260
06:24:12,240 --> 06:24:12,920
Oh, my God.

4261
06:24:13,080 --> 06:24:14,100
You're calling out.

4262
06:24:14,100 --> 06:24:14,260
You're calling out.

4263
06:24:14,440 --> 06:24:15,060
You're losing some guy.

4264
06:24:15,240 --> 06:25:23,890
his keyboard i feel like he might he should forfeit at that point i think he's just forfeited he's keyboard yeah but like i think they should give him a i know it's messed up does they give a time limit but like i don't know how long this fix is gonna be if they're gonna drag this out yeah i feel like most games have a have a time limit yeah because it's like 10 minutes or something okay he's gonna reset his computer okay he should have reset his computer the first thing he done we're going to um training mode with me dude can we move on to the next match and then he's going back to this cuz like it's the order that matters though that's this thing it doesn't actually matter for if we move if we delayed this match because 20 points yeah I mean I it adds pressure to the situation yeah i think they want to add the pressure for it right because next match could be the one that decides at all yeah

4265
06:25:28,860 --> 06:25:32,780
sorry let me rephrase it will be the match that it serves at all when emily wins

4266
06:25:37,360 --> 06:25:45,860
wait guys i'm gonna just associate for a little i'm tired i'm actually really tired now Like all the adrenaline came out of me.

4267
06:25:48,700 --> 06:25:51,280
I have to disassociate a little, guys.

4268
06:25:54,040 --> 06:25:57,260
I mean, I can't just grab all the time if she jumps so much, right?

4269
06:25:58,540 --> 06:25:59,320
What do you mean?

4270
06:26:00,340 --> 06:26:02,680
Like, I can't just grab if she jumps like everything.

4271
06:26:03,140 --> 06:26:04,540
I'm going to lock off right now.

4272
06:26:05,200 --> 06:26:06,380
Like on her knockdown?

4273
06:26:07,040 --> 06:26:07,320
Yeah.

4274
06:26:08,600 --> 06:26:09,580
Taking a quick attack.

4275
06:26:09,580 --> 06:26:13,340
Yeah, but it's mostly when you do your EX fan, I think you can grab her more.

4276
06:26:13,360 --> 06:26:16,140
more yeah

4277
06:26:19,720 --> 06:27:14,980
but if she jumps you can either meet you her or like do your back heavy or you can walk back don't worry i won't accidentally fall asleep i want i won't accidentally fall asleep guys don't worry i'm just tired now i'm actually your charge i think it's just because like fighting games tweaks too much bring space and when i dream I don't think and I had to think so much and thinking makes me tired like any normal person like thinking makes me so tired no no not off the entire yeah especially in the tournament yeah you're doing it too slow it drains me really hard

4278
06:27:19,860 --> 06:27:53,360
yeah wow that felt realistic you did a walk up there time too hungry time to do what i feel like is he back yet i also don't think she's gonna just wake up di anything back in she blocks it every time he's not back why isn't he back guys where did he go Where did he go?

4279
06:28:00,250 --> 06:28:05,190
I hope they don't put me in another one.

4280
06:28:07,630 --> 06:28:09,890
I just want to hang out.

4281
06:28:13,530 --> 06:28:14,750
I just want to hang out.

4282
06:28:15,430 --> 06:28:17,330
I don't want to play another one.

4283
06:28:18,130 --> 06:28:19,250
Just let me hang out.

4284
06:28:24,790 --> 06:28:27,130
Give me the free ride to Japan.

4285
06:28:31,630 --> 06:28:34,830
I said he's back.

4286
06:28:38,790 --> 06:28:40,290
Oh, he's just challenged.

4287
06:28:42,870 --> 06:28:43,590
Got this.

4288
06:28:52,270 --> 06:28:54,150
Well, apparently the controller is working now.

4289
06:28:55,790 --> 06:28:56,230
Alright.

4290
06:28:56,970 --> 06:28:57,650
I watch.

4291
06:29:01,170 --> 06:29:02,250
Oh my god.

4292
06:29:19,930 --> 06:29:24,050
There's that medium punch that they told me to use that overwhelm.

4293
06:29:24,070 --> 06:29:25,350
Roll that lag here.

4294
06:29:25,390 --> 06:29:26,110
It's fine.

4295
06:29:26,810 --> 06:29:31,110
I'm gonna check him.

4296
06:29:32,810 --> 06:29:33,570
Nice.

4297
06:29:36,650 --> 06:29:37,250

Stop!

4299
06:29:43,690 --> 06:29:44,450
Is he scared of you?

4300
06:29:45,670 --> 06:29:45,670
Stop.

4301
06:29:54,880 --> 06:29:55,820
Sumo spirit.

4302
06:29:56,200 --> 06:29:57,500
What the heck is that move?

4303
06:29:58,120 --> 06:29:59,920

4304
06:30:00,000 --> 06:30:00,980
Well, I know that move.

4305
06:30:03,160 --> 06:30:04,400

That game.

4312
06:30:51,420 --> 06:30:52,900
That game should count.

4313

I think.

4314
06:30:53,700 --> 06:30:56,600

4420
06:44:40,280 --> 06:44:40,280
Oh.

4421
06:44:41,100 --> 06:44:44,540
I do

4422
06:44:57,040 --> 06:44:58,740
think Bumi should be in tier 3.

4423
06:44:59,120 --> 06:45:00,360
Not tier 2.

4424
06:45:01,680 --> 06:45:06,100
Just because, like, the Seijam Slamshoot was tier 3.

4425
06:45:06,320 --> 06:45:08,480
So it wouldn't make sense to drop her a tier.

4426
06:45:09,360 --> 06:45:12,360
I guess you could say, oh, she hasn't played in a while too.

4427
06:45:12,740 --> 06:45:13,580
But isn't she...

4428
06:45:13,600 --> 06:45:17,740
primarily an fgc streamer or is that someone else

4429
06:45:23,600 --> 06:46:15,620
yeah she's really good i remember in stat slam she was like the scariest player in her and she was the scariest player in tier three yeah uh she more variety streamer i guess that's why so it's like how i haven't played slam uh tree fighter since um let me try wait can you actually treasure fan there that's not a guaranteed but i don't think she jumped i remember it when i was in the slam she was a scary player uh yeah nice try good try that was just very tilting to fight against you're basically at the doorstep of beating her though it's like one yeah i would say she's like hard to interaction hard to um i'm like the first two games are actually one disruptor yeah all

4430
06:46:22,170 --> 06:46:26,450
right here we go so it's 50 40.

4431
06:46:29,910 --> 06:46:59,490
yeah it's not fun to watch jp play i don't care who's playing jp like i remember like the other team was also playing one of the teams we first we're playing jp it was not fun to watch i was so tired of watching jp's fighting all right remember the jump yeah forcing emily to face jp is toxic therefore carcass should play match oh yeah never mind I wouldn't say that.

4432
06:46:59,970 --> 06:47:01,230
That's so true, though.

4433
06:47:07,680 --> 06:47:09,460
I certainly don't want to watch because I'm scared.

4434
06:47:10,260 --> 06:47:11,640
I'm, like, nervous for my team.

4435
06:47:13,020 --> 06:47:14,420
Okay, let's go, Curry.

4436
06:47:21,030 --> 06:47:22,790
Guys, I'm so scared to watch.

4437
06:47:30,150 --> 06:47:34,290
I know it takes a lot of skill to...

4438
06:47:35,150 --> 06:47:49,650
It takes a lot of skill also to play JP like I mean, I've looked at it I was like I'm I'm I feel tired trying to play it too Oh, oh that was close that's scary

4439
06:47:59,370 --> 06:48:01,350
This is very scary to watch

4440
06:48:06,010 --> 06:48:07,530
Oh guys, I'm scared now

4441
06:48:32,890 --> 06:48:34,450
Oh no, no.

4442
06:48:36,750 --> 06:48:38,130
I just wanted to hang out.

4443
06:48:44,150 --> 06:48:48,630
Yeah, so he's setting in for all players now.

4444
06:48:48,910 --> 06:48:50,030
I think that's the hard part.

4445
06:48:50,810 --> 06:48:52,130
Like, everyone is just tired.

4446
06:48:52,890 --> 06:48:54,810
And, like, it doesn't help that we weighed it.

4447
06:48:55,170 --> 06:48:56,330
it was quick that we got in finals.

4448
06:48:56,610 --> 06:48:59,590
I think the cons was that we all waited.

4449
06:49:01,410 --> 06:49:03,990
But this team had warmed up with another team.

4450
06:49:05,610 --> 06:49:09,190
But we literally had to wait for so long.

4451
06:49:14,210 --> 06:49:15,830
Yeah, we ain't warmed anymore.

4452
06:49:17,290 --> 06:49:20,010
God, I'm just getting thrown, man.

4453
06:49:20,250 --> 06:49:20,710
That's okay.

4454
06:49:31,920 --> 06:49:32,960
Oh, no.

4455
06:49:36,370 --> 06:49:37,510
Yeah, I don't have to do.

4456
06:49:43,500 --> 06:49:44,320
Believe, guys.

4457
06:49:44,480 --> 06:49:45,160
We believe.

4458
06:49:46,500 --> 06:49:47,740
Like, oh my god.

4459
06:49:48,340 --> 06:49:48,880
I'm sad.

4460
06:49:49,120 --> 06:49:50,340
I'm going to have to actually play it.

4461
06:49:50,480 --> 06:49:51,880
And I'm like...

4462
06:49:51,880 --> 06:49:53,200
I'm too...

4463
06:49:53,200 --> 06:49:53,740
Ugh.

4464
06:49:55,720 --> 06:49:57,100
This is my time to die.

4465
06:49:57,360 --> 06:49:57,800
Fuck!

4466
06:49:59,600 --> 06:50:01,300
I really don't want to play.

4467
06:50:01,480 --> 06:50:02,220
That's the thing.

4468
06:50:02,700 --> 06:50:02,880
Alright.

4469
06:50:04,940 --> 06:50:07,420
I don't think any of us wanted to keep playing, too.

4470
06:50:07,620 --> 06:50:19,700
that's the yeah i have to play i believe though i believe we don't have to play we don't have to play i believe i believe the

4471
06:50:25,870 --> 06:50:39,250
thing is i don't know if kimberly uh feisty would be better or yeah you got the buff you're good i don't know like feisty would be better should i be better for a second i

4472
06:50:53,480 --> 06:51:03,260
just don't want to be the last game i don't i i'd rather be the second game than the game right i

4473
06:51:28,820 --> 06:51:34,380
guess i know i'm just fully slouched right now this is so scary oh my gosh

4474
06:51:37,480 --> 06:51:38,940
this is so scary

4475
06:51:46,970 --> 06:52:30,370

4476
06:52:41,490 --> 06:52:43,950
Okay, I look for quick

4477
06:52:48,050 --> 06:52:49,930
Is this a more stressful event?

4478
06:52:50,990 --> 06:53:11,450
They'll do Oh my god, guys, I don't want them Long okay I'm way my heart like my Blood pressure might not be good right now I'm My blood pressure is definitely not okay right now.

4479
06:53:11,690 --> 06:53:13,190
He's buffed.

4480
06:53:15,710 --> 06:53:18,250
Careful after you knock him down, he'll probably do something.

4481
06:53:31,490 --> 06:53:32,590
Does he get anything?

4482
06:53:33,530 --> 06:53:34,150
I don't think so.

4483
06:53:35,590 --> 06:53:35,990
Okay.

4484
06:53:36,390 --> 06:53:37,530
I think he did.

4485
06:53:52,990 --> 06:53:53,270
Oh.

4486
06:53:53,610 --> 06:53:54,270
Oh, let me try.

4487
06:53:54,930 --> 06:53:56,370
I thought you meant like a normal medium.

4488
06:53:57,590 --> 06:53:58,110
Yeah.

4489
06:53:58,450 --> 06:54:26,310
oh i don't know no i saw it's fine we put we make car q go first okay i go second i call second yeah okay wait actually no i go third third wait i just realized the points i go third i don't know definitely car q first right yeah definitely car q first what if he's with his controller he's he's checking

4490
06:54:31,640 --> 06:55:40,760
i don't want to be last game i mean it's not gonna get to the last game because yeah no matter what 50 50 so uh at most it can't go to the fourth year so whoever we want to sit out for the fourth will we play i think emily definitely sits out i don't want to play her again okay i don't know if that's the thing i don't know if i can beat sir tina like you have you have before you just have to make some small adjustments yeah but she make it i got super overloaded when i had all the information right before we started the first thing is uh do you know how to like stop or jump in because she jumps she just like realized you can't stop a jump so if you if you can stop a jump then she jumps right at me i can't i like i just press circle but like i don't know if i can't react it in time i mean if you want we can have car queue first and then second you i don't know it's either me or you like yeah i like maybe you should go because if you lose it's okay but if you win is over i don't know uh

4491
06:55:40,760 --> 06:56:00,260
i guess okay i'll go second as if i lose whatever nephew thinks yeah if i lose then i think that that makes sense then like we go into kimberly right yeah oh damn i don't want to that's tough i

4492
06:56:08,730 --> 06:56:34,850
think it's better to have feisty on the versus three yeah whatever three i i'm so locked out guys i the jimmy didn't think i have to play same i did not want to be playing this bro i'm not like i think drinking coffee on an empty stomach was a very bad idea no i understand i i didn't i basically also did the same thing

4493
06:56:40,030 --> 06:56:58,430
on we have this and most importantly you guys can trust in me i yeah i trust you some i trust in you and by that i mean let's uh let's hope that car queue hasn't magically learned how to play on a ps4 controller but what are the scores right now um 50 50.

4494
06:57:06,100 --> 06:57:26,640
this is way too close i don't like it yeah yeah and uh most importantly it's just important to stay positive always yeah yeah we we drop a combo you miss something but it's like don't let the frustration uh and despair get to you so what do i do when they jump when she jumps at me do i just like circle

4495
06:57:29,680 --> 06:57:42,160
uh if you don't have charge you can do circle otherwise you do your headbutt okay you can also try to ear to ear her like just jump with her and yeah i try to jump over She does the charge up for it, so it's super fast.

4496
06:57:42,460 --> 06:57:46,360
Yeah, or you can do your EX headbutt if you have a lot of meter.

4497
06:57:46,920 --> 06:57:48,360
So like, that's the easiest.

4498
06:57:50,860 --> 06:57:55,120
But just make sure you're always holding back or down back and then make sure you let go of down.

4499
06:57:56,740 --> 06:57:57,200
I'm starting.

4500
06:57:58,240 --> 06:57:59,880
Yeah, we watch.

4501
06:58:12,770 --> 06:58:13,850
Two most spirit.

4502
06:58:16,130 --> 06:58:17,310
I forgot I wasn't muted.

4503
06:58:19,870 --> 06:58:33,870
oh my god oh please i hope i didn't mess up the vibe oh no that's my fault there was like sumo spirit i realized i was no why did i do that yep

4504
06:58:39,850 --> 06:58:42,950
oh no i

4505
06:58:46,910 --> 06:58:49,850
don't think he's on a playstation controller anymore

4506
06:58:55,390 --> 06:58:56,410
I don't know.

4507
06:58:56,890 --> 06:58:58,090
He's doing better.

4508
06:58:59,690 --> 06:59:00,750
Unless he was, like, practicing.

4509
06:59:00,910 --> 06:59:05,570
He might have just been practicing while we were, like, playing our 200 games, you know?

4510
06:59:06,210 --> 06:59:08,390
Like, he knew he was going to be picked next.

4511
06:59:09,690 --> 06:59:11,450
Yeah, I think he was practicing it.

4512
06:59:19,410 --> 06:59:20,290
Most likely.

4513
06:59:22,490 --> 06:59:23,670
Did he adapt that fast?

4514
06:59:23,890 --> 06:59:24,690
I don't know.

4515
06:59:24,930 --> 06:59:25,610
Oh, crap.

4516
06:59:28,410 --> 06:59:29,170
Oh, I don't know.

4517
06:59:29,250 --> 07:00:05,530
i think he's heading to double di oh my bad is he on it guys do you know he's on his controller especially yeah yeah he's on like ps5 or not okay but remember crouch medium punch into jinn right after you block yeah yeah he's he's feeding a lot of like i i drive rush heavy and he's pressing a button is that is that fake isn't it like am i pressing uh i think you're pressing oh if you press crouch medium punch i think it should be oh so he's not he's he's not on his ps4 controller anymore apparently okay copy

4518
07:00:12,660 --> 07:00:24,420
that makes sense i was gonna say like how did he like i was like there's no way he learned the ps4 that fast uh i'm waiting also

4519
07:00:36,540 --> 07:00:48,180
like is it possible to swap slots if we have to I mean, I think it's the same thing either way.

4520
07:00:48,180 --> 07:00:48,980
I see second.

4521
07:00:50,120 --> 07:00:50,380
Yeah.

4522
07:00:50,740 --> 07:00:52,100
It's the same thing either way.

4523
07:00:52,680 --> 07:00:53,080
Okay.

4524
07:00:55,560 --> 07:00:58,080
Wait, how is the same thing either way?

4525
07:00:59,980 --> 07:01:01,260
Unless Frodo wins.

4526
07:01:01,920 --> 07:01:03,360
And Frodo loses, they both are doing.

4527
07:01:05,760 --> 07:01:06,920
I just, I don't know.

4528
07:01:07,040 --> 07:01:09,100
I don't think I can do well with that pressure.

4529
07:01:09,660 --> 07:01:10,300
That's the thing.

4530
07:01:10,580 --> 07:01:12,540
I don't like being like the final call.

4531
07:01:14,340 --> 07:01:14,820
So...

4532
07:01:16,140 --> 07:01:19,460
I'd rather for, if we can, just be like, oh.

4533
07:01:20,260 --> 07:01:24,740
Like, I'm actually, like, not feeling great right now.

4534
07:01:28,880 --> 07:01:31,540
My, like, my stress level is so high.

4535
07:01:32,220 --> 07:01:32,220
I'll

4536
07:01:37,050 --> 07:01:39,650
try, guys.

4537
07:01:39,810 --> 07:01:40,170
I'll try.

4538
07:01:41,350 --> 07:01:43,390
Keep the genera pressure up.

4539
07:01:44,330 --> 07:01:44,790
Okay.

4540
07:02:01,530 --> 07:02:02,730
Oh, no.

4541
07:02:05,550 --> 07:02:07,290
Okay, guys, I'm sorry.

4542
07:02:24,990 --> 07:02:25,950
Nice try.

4543
07:02:26,510 --> 07:02:26,850
Nice try.

4544
07:02:27,010 --> 07:02:27,510
It's okay.

4545
07:02:27,870 --> 07:02:29,310
Yeah, this controller back.

4546
07:02:30,570 --> 07:02:31,510
Okay, yeah.

4547
07:02:31,830 --> 07:02:33,670
I mean, my bad.

4548
07:02:33,770 --> 07:02:34,230
It's all good.

4549
07:02:34,970 --> 07:02:35,430
You got this.

4550
07:02:35,450 --> 07:02:35,690
Okay.

4551
07:02:36,710 --> 07:02:36,750
Okay.

4552
07:02:37,390 --> 07:02:39,050
I guess it's my turn.

4553
07:02:40,470 --> 07:02:41,250
Yeah, you got this, don't you?

4554
07:02:48,450 --> 07:02:50,310
I was so warmed down.

4555
07:02:57,380 --> 07:02:57,920
Oh, what?

4556
07:02:59,640 --> 07:03:00,100
Oh, wait.

4557
07:03:00,280 --> 07:03:00,740
Oh, we're waiting.

4558
07:03:02,120 --> 07:03:02,120
Okay.

4559
07:03:52,260 --> 07:03:53,620
Why he grabs that.

4560
07:03:55,560 --> 07:03:57,120
Alright, Doki, let's get it.

4561
07:04:03,210 --> 07:04:04,030
Oh, my god.

4562
07:04:04,210 --> 07:04:04,510
What?

4563
07:04:04,570 --> 07:04:05,930
I've never seen those moves before.

4564
07:04:10,940 --> 07:04:11,380
Okay.

4565
07:04:11,400 --> 07:04:11,960
Nice.

4566
07:04:13,760 --> 07:04:14,900
Disney had a few hits.

4567
07:04:16,960 --> 07:04:17,600
Oh.

4568
07:04:23,760 --> 07:04:24,400
Uh.

4569
07:04:25,460 --> 07:04:26,100
That's right, that's right.

4570
07:04:26,600 --> 07:04:27,000
That's close.

4571
07:04:27,460 --> 07:04:28,100
Yeah.

4572
07:04:29,120 --> 07:04:32,020
Yeah, I think you can probably do more normal headbutts too.

4573
07:04:32,920 --> 07:04:33,160
Yeah.

4574
07:04:36,680 --> 07:04:37,900
Oh, predictable.

4575
07:04:38,500 --> 07:04:39,180
She's right.

4576
07:04:49,650 --> 07:04:50,090
Nice.

4577
07:05:03,470 --> 07:05:04,870
I'm just gonna use it.

4578
07:05:05,490 --> 07:05:05,870
Yeah, that's good.

4579
07:05:05,990 --> 07:05:08,510
That's good.

4580
07:05:22,160 --> 07:05:22,600
Hold on.

4581
07:05:22,600 --> 07:05:23,080
There was.

4582
07:05:23,360 --> 07:05:31,420
Hold on, I thought that was.

4583
07:05:33,300 --> 07:05:33,880
There was.

4584
07:05:44,910 --> 07:05:45,850
Nice.

4585
07:05:51,110 --> 07:05:52,990
Nice job.

4586
07:05:54,050 --> 07:05:54,830
Nice job.

4587
07:06:03,760 --> 07:06:04,700
That's your donkey.

4588
07:06:05,660 --> 07:06:06,140
Oh my god.

4589
07:06:06,320 --> 07:06:08,640
Nice job, nice job.

4590
07:06:08,780 --> 07:06:09,720
Okay.

4591
07:06:09,720 --> 07:06:12,040
Oh,

4592
07:06:32,350 --> 07:06:34,490
that's unlucky timing by me.

4593
07:06:47,420 --> 07:06:48,280
Nice.

4594
07:07:02,730 --> 07:07:03,050
Nice.

4595
07:07:06,770 --> 07:07:07,090
Nice.

4596
07:07:07,550 --> 07:07:07,890
Let's go.

4597
07:07:08,550 --> 07:07:09,690
Oh my god, nice.

4598
07:07:27,580 --> 07:07:29,300
Oh, I knew she was going to do that grab too.

4599
07:07:38,540 --> 07:07:39,100
Let's go.

4600
07:07:40,540 --> 07:07:42,300
I can land at one more time, you win.

4601
07:07:49,510 --> 07:07:49,830
Oh.

4602
07:07:51,350 --> 07:07:51,750
Oh, no.

4603
07:08:04,780 --> 07:08:04,920
Oh.

4604
07:08:04,940 --> 07:08:07,620
Ah, choice does that grab see.

4605
07:08:09,840 --> 07:08:10,080
Oh.

4606
07:08:11,540 --> 07:08:14,680
No worries, no worries.

4607
07:08:18,280 --> 07:08:19,120
Yep.

4608
07:08:24,220 --> 07:08:25,340
That's fine.

4609
07:08:29,820 --> 07:08:30,660
Yep.

4610
07:08:32,840 --> 07:08:35,900
Oh, I was trying to do the the X went.

4611
07:08:39,260 --> 07:08:39,820
Oh no.

4612
07:08:40,840 --> 07:08:41,120
It's okay.

4613
07:08:41,400 --> 07:08:44,480
If you can land your auto combo, it's kind of low.

4614
07:08:54,630 --> 07:08:56,150
Oh, this is bad though.

4615
07:09:04,170 --> 07:09:06,850
We're both, I'm burnt out though.

4616
07:09:07,970 --> 07:09:08,530
It's very risky.

4617
07:09:09,470 --> 07:09:10,630
No, you're going to get yours back soon.

4618
07:09:11,310 --> 07:09:13,210
You can wait for yours to come back if you want.

4619
07:09:14,690 --> 07:09:15,830
Oh, no!

4620
07:09:19,930 --> 07:09:20,510
Oh!

4621
07:09:21,630 --> 07:09:22,770
Nice try, nice try.

4622
07:09:22,890 --> 07:09:24,370
NT guys.

4623
07:09:27,750 --> 07:09:28,410
Very, very close.

4624
07:09:28,910 --> 07:09:28,990
Yeah.

4625
07:09:29,730 --> 07:09:31,710
I think you got this.

4626
07:09:34,870 --> 07:09:35,230
Yeah.

4627
07:09:36,630 --> 07:09:37,170
Give us.

4628
07:09:37,470 --> 07:09:38,150
Oh my gosh.

4629
07:09:46,450 --> 07:09:47,170
Okay.

4630
07:09:47,470 --> 07:09:47,570
Okay.

4631
07:09:47,570 --> 07:09:48,490
Nice.

4632
07:09:49,190 --> 07:09:50,050
Big start.

4633
07:09:58,160 --> 07:09:59,560
Nice.

4634
07:10:13,600 --> 07:10:14,300
Okay.

4635
07:10:16,180 --> 07:10:17,200
Just me, I heard you can.

4636
07:10:21,360 --> 07:10:22,180
You're here.

4637
07:10:25,680 --> 07:10:45,780
try doing just di's more in neutral because i think she's not gonna stop it going and also wait okay oh um that's fine as long as she doesn't die back oh what oh my controller she does that i'm so sad because my controller didn't work there

4638
07:10:49,540 --> 07:10:58,310
oh my light controller actually stopped working I don't want to use it.

4639
07:10:58,430 --> 07:10:59,030
Save it, save it, save it.

4640
07:10:59,030 --> 07:11:03,670
Yeah, save it.

4641
07:11:04,090 --> 07:11:05,670
Oh, that sucks.

4642
07:11:05,850 --> 07:11:07,350
That round, my controller's not working.

4643
07:11:15,650 --> 07:11:16,770
Oh, he's...

4644
07:11:16,770 --> 07:11:17,110
Okay.

4645
07:11:17,770 --> 07:11:18,370
Black eye?

4646
07:11:25,890 --> 07:11:26,450
Nice.

4647
07:11:31,140 --> 07:11:32,120
Oh, no.

4648
07:11:33,080 --> 07:11:33,320
Okay.

4649
07:11:34,960 --> 07:11:35,220
Okay.

4650
07:11:38,140 --> 07:11:38,700
Nice.

4651
07:11:38,920 --> 07:11:39,200
Nice.

4652
07:11:40,960 --> 07:11:41,460
Nice.

4653
07:12:01,420 --> 07:12:01,920
Okay.

4654
07:12:02,540 --> 07:12:03,000
Nice.

4655
07:12:03,140 --> 07:12:03,440
Let's go.

4656
07:12:03,740 --> 07:12:04,580
We did it.

4657
07:12:04,920 --> 07:12:05,260
Let's go.

4658
07:12:05,440 --> 07:12:05,960
Good luck.

4659
07:12:06,480 --> 07:12:07,300
I'm leaving.

4660
07:12:07,740 --> 07:12:08,640
I'll be back.

4661
07:12:08,860 --> 07:12:09,660
That's crazy.

4662
07:12:10,080 --> 07:12:10,240
I mean, I'm leaving.

4663
07:12:10,240 --> 07:12:10,280
All right.

4664
07:12:11,180 --> 07:12:11,480
I mean.

4665
07:12:11,620 --> 07:12:12,220
Oh my God.

4666
07:12:12,560 --> 07:12:14,240
Leaving it all up to me so bad.

4667
07:12:15,820 --> 07:12:16,160
No, no.

4668
07:12:16,320 --> 07:12:17,300
You 100% got it.

4669
07:12:17,540 --> 07:12:17,980
No, it's not.

4670
07:12:17,980 --> 07:12:18,140
It's not.

4671
07:12:18,360 --> 07:12:18,500
It's not.

4672
07:12:18,500 --> 07:12:18,740
It's not.

4673
07:12:18,860 --> 07:12:18,980
It's not.

4674
07:12:19,440 --> 07:12:21,920
It's actually the only fitting thing.

4675
07:12:22,840 --> 07:12:23,800
I think you're right here.

4676
07:12:24,620 --> 07:12:26,160
I think when he's growing.

4677
07:12:26,160 --> 07:12:46,000
be right back show him more but when he gets knocked out he matches something a lot okay so like when you do like a button dry rush like you can grab him i think okay yep a positive you got this yeah you got three games to adapt yep yeah

4678
07:13:04,070 --> 07:13:17,970
also the ex cycle crusher is plus one in burnout when you're in burnout and the regular kickstarter are zero so like don't match on the ex like on the ex one you just have to hold it or see you guys on the ex like cycle crusher okay

4679
07:13:21,550 --> 07:13:36,510
oh wait you guys are on different sides on the wrong side yeah just i just wait what yeah i think you just you're supposed to be technically player one oh i think they're because their overlay is wrong that's why so just just kill them just kill them okay

4680
07:14:22,530 --> 07:14:24,670
Hold on guys, I'm double perfecting him.

4681
07:14:25,710 --> 07:14:26,530
Well that was nice.

4682
07:14:26,690 --> 07:14:27,570
That's a good start.

4683
07:14:27,670 --> 07:14:29,670
I did that two rounds ago.

4684
07:14:29,830 --> 07:14:30,530
It was good.

4685
07:15:00,770 --> 07:15:01,250
Nice.

4686
07:15:26,910 --> 07:15:27,370
Nice.

4687
07:15:49,110 --> 07:15:49,690
Thank god.

4688
07:15:51,090 --> 07:15:52,570
I forgot about spectating.

4689
07:15:53,990 --> 07:15:54,010
Nice.

4690
07:15:54,430 --> 07:16:00,010
If he goes over, like when you do double moves, there's sometimes don't press a clutch every punch and you can punish him if he goes on the other side.

4691
07:16:00,150 --> 07:16:00,470
Okay.

4692
07:16:02,470 --> 07:16:03,530
No, close.

4693
07:16:03,850 --> 07:16:04,910
Oh my god.

4694
07:16:04,990 --> 07:16:13,230
Oh my god.

4695
07:16:13,230 --> 07:16:15,610
Oh my god.

4696
07:16:15,610 --> 07:16:15,830
Oh my god.

4697
07:16:18,490 --> 07:16:19,630
Oh my god.

4698
07:16:19,630 --> 07:16:20,610
I'm gonna stop watching.

4699
07:16:20,730 --> 07:16:21,790
I'm tired of me.

4700
07:16:24,870 --> 07:16:25,590
I'm just tired.

4701
07:16:26,330 --> 07:16:28,330
Just keep running off of him because he keeps jabbing.

4702
07:16:38,890 --> 07:16:39,530
Oh my god.

4703
07:16:39,550 --> 07:16:40,110
Oh my god.

4704
07:16:51,220 --> 07:16:51,560
Amazing.

4705
07:16:52,540 --> 07:16:53,580
This game is amazing.

4706
07:16:53,900 --> 07:16:54,420
Oh, I'm dead.

4707
07:16:55,760 --> 07:16:58,440
On defense, you have to jump out or back dive sometimes.

4708
07:16:58,960 --> 07:17:01,440
I think you're just taking the throw too much for driver recently.

4709
07:17:02,120 --> 07:17:02,520
Okay.

4710
07:18:05,660 --> 07:18:06,840
Nice, nice, nice.

4711
07:18:09,200 --> 07:18:15,310
oh my god

4712
07:19:01,450 --> 07:19:03,490
nice you can still summon

4713
07:19:13,290 --> 07:19:32,050
nice all right get him to the corner just watch the driver so he's still doing a lot watch watch out for the drive reversals in the corner when you have him there oh my god he's checking everything i gotta stop i'm

4714
07:19:46,950 --> 07:19:56,950
back but i'm also not back guys i'm not okay go okay i'll come i'll come back i'll come here and back

4715
07:20:19,250 --> 07:20:29,610
oh my god i'm too tired i think tough on you as a driver so yeah but Oh, I thought it was too far.

4716
07:20:29,750 --> 07:20:30,830
I didn't think it was going to hit it.

4717
07:20:39,210 --> 07:20:39,510
What?

4718
07:21:01,330 --> 07:21:03,770
I'm just so scared of doing anything on Waco.

4719
07:21:17,040 --> 07:21:17,240
Nice.

4720
07:21:17,440 --> 07:21:18,640
You can try and look for whip when this is.

4721
07:21:18,840 --> 07:21:20,620
I feel like you whip the scissor kick sometimes.

4722
07:21:21,840 --> 07:21:22,200
OK.

4723
07:21:37,360 --> 07:21:39,780
Oh my god, bro.

4724
07:21:50,440 --> 07:21:51,140
No,

4725
07:21:54,580 --> 07:21:55,580
that was too far.

4726
07:21:56,640 --> 07:21:58,600
Oh, should have just the item.

4727
07:22:01,180 --> 07:22:02,540
I'm too tired, man.

4728
07:22:03,020 --> 07:22:04,580
Like, I just...

4729
07:23:24,160 --> 07:23:25,180
Nice and nice.

4730
07:23:25,200 --> 07:23:29,280
You can try drive rushing after you run off of him and he blocks as he always backdashes.

4731
07:23:29,800 --> 07:23:30,440
Okay, you're right.

4732
07:24:07,550 --> 07:24:07,990
Nice.

4733
07:24:12,350 --> 07:24:13,590
Hit level one.

4734
07:24:14,150 --> 07:24:14,590
That's fine.

4735
07:24:15,470 --> 07:24:15,910
That's fine.

4736
07:24:19,970 --> 07:24:20,410
That's fine.

4737
07:24:20,410 --> 07:24:20,510
That's fine.

4738
07:24:20,510 --> 07:24:25,950
And I think if you drive rush, do cross the leg punch, because sometimes that scissor kicks are going over it for some reason.

4739
07:24:26,810 --> 07:24:28,790
You drive rush, crouch and leg punch, okay.

4740
07:24:52,810 --> 07:24:53,330
Good.

4741
07:25:07,280 --> 07:25:08,960
Ah, okay.

4742
07:25:09,840 --> 07:25:10,860
She's getting thrown.

4743
07:25:30,100 --> 07:25:31,400
I don't even know who I know.

4744
07:25:31,400 --> 07:25:32,320
Yeah, be really careful about Super.

4745
07:25:32,900 --> 07:25:34,080
They try and beat the Super.

4746
07:25:50,600 --> 07:25:51,120
Okay.

4747
07:25:51,440 --> 07:25:52,300
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

4748
07:25:52,480 --> 07:25:52,560
Nice, nice.

4749
07:25:52,580 --> 07:25:53,420
There we go.

4750
07:25:53,560 --> 07:25:54,200
There we go.

4751
07:25:54,900 --> 07:26:00,690
All right All right one final.

4752
07:26:01,170 --> 07:26:04,530
Let's go curry One final.

4753
07:26:04,970 --> 07:26:05,980
Let's go curry

4754
07:26:16,120 --> 07:26:29,950
Let's go I'm glad I'm not lazy right now Come on, let's go curry

4755
07:26:33,130 --> 07:26:33,710
That's fine.

4756
07:26:34,050 --> 07:26:34,290
Oh no.

4757
07:26:42,520 --> 07:26:43,320
Does he feel that?

4758
07:26:43,500 --> 07:26:43,680
No.

4759
07:26:46,980 --> 07:26:49,240
It's so scary when you're like trying to figure out the kills.

4760
07:26:49,960 --> 07:26:50,140
Let's go.

4761
07:26:50,280 --> 07:26:50,420
Let's go.

4762
07:26:50,620 --> 07:26:50,780
One more.

4763
07:26:52,060 --> 07:26:52,900
Come on.

4764
07:26:52,900 --> 07:26:53,360
All right.

4765
07:26:53,400 --> 07:26:53,840
One more.

4766
07:26:53,960 --> 07:26:54,300
One more.

4767
07:26:54,820 --> 07:26:55,320
Let's go.

4768
07:27:00,100 --> 07:27:00,940
One more.

4769
07:27:01,460 --> 07:27:01,800
Nice.

4770
07:27:05,320 --> 07:27:05,740
Nice.

4771
07:27:06,600 --> 07:27:07,580
Watch out for the driver.

4772
07:27:09,900 --> 07:27:11,240
They won't expect it the third time.

4773
07:27:11,520 --> 07:27:12,340
Oh, he didn't.

4774
07:27:12,780 --> 07:27:15,880
He actually expected it for the third time.

4775
07:27:17,460 --> 07:27:18,120
It's okay.

4776
07:27:18,980 --> 07:27:19,900
Let's do one more hit.

4777
07:27:22,580 --> 07:27:23,680
He level three.

4778
07:27:26,640 --> 07:27:27,160
Let's go!

4779
07:27:27,660 --> 07:27:28,540
We going to Japan?

4780
07:27:28,920 --> 07:27:30,140
Oh my god!

4781
07:27:30,300 --> 07:27:31,060
Wait, is that it?

4782
07:27:31,240 --> 07:27:31,880
Is that it?

4783
07:27:32,020 --> 07:27:32,800
Are we going to Japan?

4784
07:27:33,000 --> 07:27:34,120
Are we going to Japan?

4785
07:27:34,120 --> 07:27:34,480
Are we going to Japan?

4786
07:27:36,760 --> 07:27:38,080
Oh my god!

4787
07:27:38,080 --> 07:27:38,880
Oh my god!

4788
07:27:38,880 --> 07:27:42,680
See you all in Japan!

4789
07:27:43,220 --> 07:27:44,220
Oh my god!

4790
07:27:44,600 --> 07:27:45,780
Oh my god!

4791
07:27:46,000 --> 07:27:47,100
He did it!

4792
07:27:47,180 --> 07:27:47,780
You did it!

4793
07:27:48,720 --> 07:27:52,140
Oh my god, I'm about to try, bro.

4794
07:27:52,400 --> 07:27:54,440
Oh my god, that was the most intense fight.

4795
07:27:54,760 --> 07:27:56,600
Bro, I think I would put you on a third set.

4796
07:27:56,800 --> 07:27:57,800
Like, you needed three.

4797
07:27:58,080 --> 07:27:59,840
You needed all six matches.

4798
07:28:00,880 --> 07:28:04,180
The manager you get the clutch today is absolutely absurd.

4799
07:28:04,280 --> 07:28:05,060
You are insane.

4800
07:28:05,760 --> 07:29:28,020
my god bro i'm literally about to cry i'm i'm so hungry i get hot pot let's go there's no way i can't believe we won i can't believe it oh congratulations everyone oh my god everyone it and it's like it's also like every point really mattered as well like it's a good team effort because we need the home oh but i i was not watching half of those memes i could not watch i was it was feisty clutching doki the round before that also locking in i don't know you just like ascended to a new level with the honda yeah like my third i flipped back to what her original form was bro no my tummy was hurting during that too i was like I'm not locked in but yet somehow it worked oh my god bro that was nuts cheese guys we all did so well I'm so surprised I lost I think six times versus JP if I was actually oh yeah you know I'm glad I'm not you I don't want to we should have a show match to end it up I want to see your nephew versus item yeah nephew versus item I okay I'm gonna demand it i demand a

4801
07:29:28,020 --> 07:30:02,920
show match of the coaches i can't believe it i can't believe my eyes bro i feel like i'm i don't know that's insane that's crazy i'm glad we feisty was the one that ended the entire tournament oh yeah that was such a good end yeah yeah i knew yeah that if i won against karki with a defunct controller would that even be satisfying i think yeah yeah no he got his controller back working oh no

4802
07:30:07,020 --> 07:30:25,540
oh that's awkward i thought he got it back yeah he was playing really well bro that guy's a prodigy what the heck he instantly knew how to use the ps5 controller yeah that's insane what He played on your pad before, like in our first stage of the upside that I played with him,

4803
07:30:25,580 --> 07:30:26,360
he was in your pad.

4804
07:30:26,480 --> 07:30:31,140
Oh, that's why I was going to say, did he pick that up instantly?

4805
07:30:31,560 --> 07:30:34,640
Like in just like 30 minutes, he just learned how to play.

4806
07:30:37,300 --> 07:30:37,980
Oh, man.

4807
07:30:38,080 --> 07:30:39,280
Oh, my God, bro.

4808
07:30:39,620 --> 07:30:41,040
I'm just in a shock.

4809
07:30:41,240 --> 07:30:43,060
I feel like I can't believe it.

4810
07:30:43,240 --> 07:30:45,680
You know, you know what I was doing while I was, I was muted.

4811
07:30:45,740 --> 07:30:49,620
I was saying, let's go Curry, like doing the Justin jinx on him.

4812
07:30:50,680 --> 07:30:51,520
And it worked.

4813
07:30:51,840 --> 07:30:54,000
It worked every time I said, let's go, Curry.

4814
07:30:54,280 --> 07:30:54,980
Like, he lost.

4815
07:30:55,080 --> 07:30:57,220
I was like, all right, I'm going to keep doing that.

4816
07:30:57,260 --> 07:30:58,960
Dude, I thought it was over, bro.

4817
07:31:01,040 --> 07:31:02,100
I thought it was over.

4818
07:31:02,120 --> 07:31:03,320
I was so tired.

4819
07:31:04,680 --> 07:31:05,420
Me too.

4820
07:31:05,520 --> 07:31:06,780
Bro, we've been streaming.

4821
07:31:07,120 --> 07:31:11,560
I mean, I started at the exact not determined start, but we've been streaming for almost eight hours.

4822
07:31:12,780 --> 07:31:14,440
Yeah, you don't usually stream that long, right?

4823
07:31:14,700 --> 07:31:15,080
No.

4824
07:31:15,860 --> 07:31:16,300
No.

4825
07:31:16,880 --> 07:31:17,920
Unless it's rivals.

4826
07:31:18,060 --> 07:31:20,120
And I can stream for, like, 30 hours.

4827
07:31:21,160 --> 07:31:30,440
FGC like fighting games take too much brain power and like my brain does not have that capacity for that name like like after three games I'm like I'm out.

4828
07:31:30,600 --> 07:31:31,620

I did not expect to go to the finals and win it all.

4842
07:34:01,680 --> 07:34:03,260
Like, everything was going wrong for me.

4843

That was the winning strat.

4852
07:35:30,920 --> 07:35:33,440

4853
07:35:37,180 --> 07:35:37,780
Yeah.

4854
07:35:38,780 --> 07:35:42,460
Oh, I know I do better when I don't think because they can't predict me.

4855
07:35:42,540 --> 07:35:44,540
I was doing the dumbest shit possible.

4856
07:35:45,460 --> 07:35:46,240
It works.

4857
07:35:48,020 --> 07:35:48,620

Oh, my God.

4873
07:37:05,520 --> 07:37:07,080
My brain is so tight.

4874
07:37:07,160 --> 07:37:08,720
My tummy hurts, man.

4875
07:37:09,040 --> 07:37:15,160
I, my, my tummy hurt, man.

4876
07:37:15,980 --> 07:37:19,580
Oh, I feel bad for the East Coasters.

4877
07:37:21,160 --> 07:37:52,080
um we're the east coasters that have to like on on everyone's teams and oh yeah the people who are doing the stage i'm slap they have to do stage i'm slam right tomorrow straight away bro i feel bad for fumi she's on 2x ko isn't she bro she has to go straight to 2x ko right like on the neck just to do the finals tomorrow bro oh my god yeah oh my god poor fumi yeah oh my god i don't guess I have to do the Apex one,

4878
07:37:52,280 --> 07:37:53,500
but like that's hot and sick.

4879
07:37:54,180 --> 07:37:55,380
It's for charity.

4880
07:37:55,640 --> 07:37:58,960
So it's like if I don't kill anyone, I'm the seeker.

4881
07:37:59,440 --> 07:38:02,960
So I'm like, no, but thing is, it's just a for fun tournament.

4882
07:38:03,100 --> 07:38:08,500
So I'm just like, I don't really care about it too much because like it's just for fun and it's for charity.

4883
07:38:08,880 --> 07:38:10,580
So like I'm the seeker too.

4884
07:38:10,720 --> 07:38:13,900
So yeah, but SK wasn't in the semi, like the finals.

4885
07:38:14,200 --> 07:38:18,440
So like they clocked out after, you know, they've got in semis and it clocked up.

4886
07:38:18,600 --> 07:39:10,300
But we have like, was in is in 2x ko and she made it to the finals so like yeah i'm just like i just have to shoot people because like for the hide and see because i'm a seeker i mean it would be great better if i was a hider so i could just i could just chill i have to actually shoot people so um in apex same apex by the way oh my god uh yeah i'm just i'm just glad i'm just glad i i i won i i i think if i had another day playing honda i think i it would be illegal for me in tier one like in the baby tier i i learned way too fast even i was like no i learned way too fast on Honda.

4887
07:39:10,440 --> 07:39:15,320
I think like Honda was like it like unlocked my third eye.

4888
07:39:17,760 --> 07:39:18,320
Yeah.

4889
07:39:20,280 --> 07:39:20,840
Yeah.

4890
07:39:21,660 --> 07:39:21,660
Yeah.

4891
07:39:22,000 --> 07:39:22,340
That's what.

4892
07:39:22,500 --> 07:39:22,500
Yeah.

4893
07:39:22,620 --> 07:39:28,820
So I'm just like because like I saw people were like how the heck is she in baby tier when she's flat?

4894
07:39:28,940 --> 07:39:32,260
I was like please I swear to God I play silver.

4895
07:39:34,180 --> 07:40:12,320
I was like guys I swear to God I started learning three days ago on honda yeah no i i learned honda faster than i learned gif because gif is such a zan gif is such a passive play style when you get to higher elo so like um um but the higher by higher elo i meant silver four because i i was hard to suck silver four on zan gif for so long and i played rank a lot and then i gave up and just was like and i started making custom rooms because um um I started making custom runes because I was hard stuck.

4896
07:40:12,320 --> 07:40:19,020
I was hard stuck Silver 4 on Zangief because my aggressive playstyle was not working in Silver 4.

4897
07:40:19,340 --> 07:40:20,320
I had to play passive.

4898
07:40:20,460 --> 07:40:21,860
And I was like, I don't like that.

4899
07:40:24,300 --> 07:40:26,260
I was like, I don't like that.

4900
07:40:26,560 --> 07:40:30,060
And thank God, people at the Seijan Slam, they did not.

4901
07:40:33,340 --> 07:41:34,720
They did not like realize that I was not passive on Zangief because, you know, Zangief played tend to be super passive until they like tend to be like play really passive and patiently but I was just like no no no oh yeah I'm so happy guys I do adrenaline I'm no longer EP yeah and I started blocking too I started I had to I did you not see what Aki was doing like I had to start blocking it was the only way to punish it I was like not today not today today oh i was i'm happy that um saratina started playing more aggressively because i stopped engaging did you see that she like she started playing because i was like i ain't playing your game and i just stopped i stopped moving like bro i was like you're first because the timer's on my side

4902
07:41:39,520 --> 07:41:40,500
That's right.

4903
07:41:41,960 --> 07:41:43,640
Justin would be so proud of me.

4904
07:41:43,960 --> 07:41:44,360
Oh my god.

4905
07:41:44,440 --> 07:41:47,640
Wait, I want to message Big Bird and be like, I won.

4906
07:41:49,120 --> 07:41:50,240
I won.

4907
07:41:52,620 --> 07:41:53,740
I won.

4908
07:41:55,080 --> 07:41:56,540
All my matches.

4909
07:41:56,760 --> 07:41:58,140
Big Bird wouldn't have to know.

4910
07:41:58,620 --> 07:42:00,860
I'm lying, but like, he doesn't have to know.

4911
07:42:04,540 --> 07:42:07,540
When you stood still, that was aura.

4912
07:42:08,280 --> 07:42:09,320
Oh my god.

4913
07:42:10,980 --> 07:42:14,900

4914
07:42:19,840 --> 07:42:38,440

4915
07:42:42,100 --> 07:42:44,220
Lying on Sesame Street.

4916
07:42:44,600 --> 07:42:46,900
Yeah, just a little white lie.

4917
07:42:47,680 --> 07:42:48,920
Technically, I won all my matches.

4918
07:42:49,160 --> 07:42:50,360
If you talk about the over...

4919
07:42:50,360 --> 07:42:53,500
If you think about it, I wasn't specific on...

4920
07:42:53,500 --> 07:42:55,920
Like, he could think overall matches, guys.

4921
07:42:56,000 --> 07:42:56,860
Like, he doesn't know if...

4922
07:42:56,860 --> 07:43:02,700
He thinks, you know, I didn't specify was overall matches or individual matches, you know?

4923
07:43:02,760 --> 07:43:08,120
I didn't lie, because I meant overall matches where my team all won together.

4924
07:43:08,520 --> 07:43:09,040
Like...

4925
07:43:13,080 --> 07:43:14,940
That's all that matters.

4926
07:43:15,440 --> 07:43:18,560
Anyway, guys, as always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture check.

4927
07:43:18,840 --> 07:43:20,700
Get up and go around to get that blood flow.

4928
07:43:20,800 --> 07:43:23,760
If you stay up for me, head to bed because you deserve it.

4929
07:43:23,980 --> 07:43:25,500
It's not about time, everyone.

4930
07:43:25,700 --> 07:43:28,480
Treat yourself because I'm treating myself.

4931
07:43:29,320 --> 07:43:30,140
Bye-bye, everyone.

4932
07:43:30,620 --> 07:43:30,960
Bye.

4933
07:43:42,050 --> 07:43:42,910
Secret ending.

4934
07:43:42,990 --> 07:43:43,430
Secret ending.

4935
07:43:43,570 --> 07:43:45,630
By treating yourself, you should buy my controller.

4936
07:43:49,550 --> 07:43:51,230
You know how you can do to treat yourself?

4937
07:43:51,630 --> 07:43:55,810
Why don't you get my pro controller right now?

4938
07:43:56,350 --> 07:43:58,310
That's a good way to treat yourself.

4939
07:43:58,870 --> 07:43:59,890
Look at that.

4940
07:44:03,430 --> 07:44:05,270
Anyway, bye for real.

4941
07:44:05,450 --> 07:44:06,210
Treat yourself.

4942
07:44:06,650 --> 07:44:07,510
Buy my merch.
