1
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:57,830
Hello, hello, oh my god, I am so, oh my gosh, I hear myself, why do I hear myself?

2
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:59,690
Oh, it's because I have another tab open.

3
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,250
I have another stream open.

4
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:04,030
Okay, but yeah, I'm super nervous.

5
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,930
I have never talked to Big Bird before, but yes, there's the meeting of birds.

6
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:12,730
I just need Angry Bird now, and then the bird trifecta is complete.

7
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:18,270
But yes, today I am getting coached by the Big Bird.

8
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:44,550
and what's funny um when i was like um uh i was like asking uh because like you know my manager made my waiting room for me and then my manager was like what's big bird social and then i was just like just google it and he was and then he just sent me a picture of big bird from sesame street he's like i don't think this is the one you're collabing with right i was

9
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,570
is the Sesame Street Big Bird?

10
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:55,430
Because I don't know which Big Bird you're talking about.

11
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,490
And I was like, no, no, Big Bird.

12
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:00,750
And then look up Big Bird, FGC.

13
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:05,910
Yeah, we don't know that for sure.

14
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,850
That could be him in the Big Bird suit.

15
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:08,430
You're right.

16
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,730
Have we ever seen Big Bird from Sesame Street?

17
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:15,750
And Big Bird, the Street Fighter player in the same room?

18
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:16,350
Hmm.

19
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:45,130
um um but yeah i am so nervous this will be my very first time um talking to them i you know i shot my shot were mutuals from the last stage i'm slammed because i think you watched me when i played gif i'm sorry that i'm not a gif player anymore i i have cemented i know like yesterday i was like i don't know i don't know which one to pick do i pick zane gif or do i pick today today i'm

20
00:03:48,270 --> 00:04:15,510
all i did was just go headbutt headbutt headbutt headbutt and then i got a nine game win streak i've never had that with zangif i swear to god when i was playing zangif it was i i had to play a fucking mind game to like get close to a person to get a grapple in i have to be like all right how How do I get close to you so I can grab you?

21
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:21,130
But there as the Honda, all I do was just like, headbutt.

22
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,590
I absolutely, I don't believe, I posted it on Twitter.

23
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:30,670
I legitimately, all I did was just, I just abused this.

24
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:36,890
Sometimes I'd swap it up a little bit by using the DUI move.

25
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,290
That's my mix up.

26
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:44,510
If headbutt don't work, I use my DUI.

27
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:46,910
Wait, okay.

28
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:49,350
For those who don't, but me, bam!

29
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,650
Look at that.

30
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:55,270
And then I went against a jury that figured out my next move.

31
00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:00,470
It's like, because they're like, there's no way she's going to use the headbutt again.

32
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:01,910
And they always think that.

33
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:02,870
I don't know why.

34
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:08,350
They never, they're like, there's no way she's going to use the headbutt again.

35
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:09,370
But then I do.

36
00:05:10,290 --> 00:06:37,930
will say i got the silver five and then for some reason those players figured out that only know like two mooms essentially i don't know how they figured it out but i've i've been like hard stuck silver five for an hour but yet i got the nine game win streak after an hour of playing stuck in silver five after these players you're so smart i don't know how they figured it out but they figured it out that i can only do like one to two moves i don't know though i don't know how they figured that out it's so it's a mystery like the gap between iqs the gap between iqs of silver four to silver five is actually insane um i like cruise through from silver one to silver four just doing headbutt and then it felt like silver five players are like 50 IQ points above silver four uh it's like they're an ai that daft to me i know i swear to god they must be ai they aren't real they must be they must be smurfing how dare they know how to block um yeah anyway so uh so we're gonna stick with i'm sorry i

37
00:06:37,930 --> 00:08:02,750
know for all the the the dogeef uh the dogeef fans i'm so sorry for my loyal fans that it has to come this way but you know how i'm saying geef i literally gave up on rink at apparently nephew was like yeah you ended on silver four and then you fucking gave up because it was so tilting and i was like that sounds like me uh but i struggled so hard silver like so like to get to silver for it but then i literally in honda i was it was like a walk on the park i felt like i was literally just like scrolling around the park the sun is out and i'm so happy i was like like i grinded more on zangief in rank than i ever did on honda like my peak I peed like I have my highest rank is on Honda and I have less than five hours on Honda that's the saddest part it's actually that's the saddest part five hours of Honda and I have a higher rank than my Zankeep which I struggled so much on it was fun though I will say that uh yeah it was so Yeah,

38
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,630
Honda was like the perfect cheese for me.

39
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:11,130
But I specifically came for Geek Volume 2.

40
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:11,750
I'm sorry.

41
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,810
This is Street Fighter's fault.

42
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:15,830
Buff Zang Geek.

43
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,930
And I'll come back as Geek, guys.

44
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,250
Buff Zang Geek.

45
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,790
Hashtag Buff him.

46
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:27,150
And so DeHonda's head game is crazy.

47
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,510
What if you add playing from the right side?

48
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,930
Okay, no, that's too much.

49
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,430
We do not play on the right side.

50
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,310
If I'm on the right side, I'm gonna jump.

51
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:37,210
I'm gonna find my way to go go back to the

52
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:48,910
Yeah, we will riot if you want me back on The second tournament above Zangief.

53
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,990
That's the only way I'll come back

54
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:59,430
Zangief is like 30 tiers above e Honda what is in this one top tiers.

55
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:00,010
What are you?

56
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:34,290
Yeah, yes, but I am in the baby level okay like i am in the baby elo and the thing is the players in baby elo do not know what the fuck to do with the headbutt while in zhangif the way to for me to be able to use my cheesy move of grappling is i have to slowly get to them and i have to close the gap between me and the other player on zhangif but the thing with honda is i have one move that can I don't have to walk over.

57
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,990
I don't have to slowly walk over at Zangief.

58
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:43,110
I could literally use one move to close the gap between me and the opponent on Honda.

59
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:46,290
So, like, that's like...

60
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,310
Walking is so hard.

61
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,250
You don't understand.

62
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,850
Walking is so hard in baby level.

63
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:02,590
So, we're gonna stick with Honda.

64
00:10:03,150 --> 00:11:26,410
If Zangief if ever gets buffed again um i'll come and i get invited to a tournament i'll come back you hear that capcom it's for my loyal fans i'll do it um wink wink uh but yes i also know exactly who i'm fighting on fighting with um so there is one player that i'm a bit scared of because like she did previous say jam slams already and see I think she did like two streets so someone dropped out yeah someone dropped out um um like a beginner dropped out and so I am worried about the person that was replacing her because she did two say jam slams before I did one for street fighter she did two but yet she's placed in baby level so that's like what I well yeah but it's been a year I didn't touch the game for a year and I think she had more recent experience than me like but yet she is also in the baby baby tier so um so that's what i'm worried about because she's like in baby tier um but yet she has more experience than me um but then the other two are also like babies as well like the

65
00:11:26,410 --> 00:12:43,840
other two i'm not as scared i'm just scared of the other one that might not be as baby as the other two yeah um so that's what i'm worried about she plays apparently she plays a key as well so uh so she has more experience than all of us there down there so well my main goal is to win one game and like i was i was telling nephew i was like i'm so scared about like because i lost my win streak to a jury and um to a jury and then um i was like i'm so scared because one of the players are playing jury apparently and then he was like you're fine she's eye and rank and i was like yeah but i'm silver i was like i don't know it's like what if she gets to silver and then he nephew was like don't worry you'll be diving back then and he has such high x i have no idea why the fuck you thinks I am smart enough to get there but I was like I don't know why he thinks that he has that much confidence in me I'm I don't know how why he thinks that he's a bit too confident in me

66
00:12:47,880 --> 00:14:16,220
but yeah anyway I'm gonna call it big bird now I am I am super nervous ha ha ha ha my first time so I hope everything will be okay oh yeah as long as everyone believes in one game that's all I need to know apparently okay so the people I'm fighting I'm fighting Aki Ryu and jury and then I've got I'm like wait aren't all those characters sort of countering me like what the fuck I'm like wait that's not fair it's not fair what do you want they all play all these characters that are supposed what the fuck why they all counter me like that's not fair i pick this is why i should pick my character last this is like they all throw at me like no that's even worse what are you talking about back to keep what a fuck that is the major keep calendar what the fuck are you talking the biggest issue is the fact that i have someone and that's literally one of the biggest counters to keep so like so it's basically like okay even if i played the same keep it'd be like fuck you i guess also funny story

67
00:14:16,220 --> 00:15:30,340
um after the capcon stream um after the capcon stream the one from yesterday uh um uh the production team was but like I think they're talking about me um please make sure you don't swear during the when you are on the broadcast when you're on the Capcom main channel please refrain from cursing and then and like after the stream was done and I was like I'm sorry I was like I think I think they were talking about me and I was like I'm so sorry I'm I was like I play FPS game so it comes to me of like the person that tweeted out they're like since joki's debut she has cursed like 60 000 times and i linked that tweet just to be like i'm so sorry like it's i'm it's a problem but i can censor myself for a sponsor i was like don't worry though i was just wasn't aware and i can censor myself on stream when i have to um obviously i lied but like they don't have to know that If you're watching,

68
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,340
if Capcom's on, I can censor myself.

69
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,120
I was just making a joke.

70
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:34,760
Don't worry.

71
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:38,060
Please do not, do not blacklist me.

72
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,920
Okay, all right, all right.

73
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,120
Um, okay, I'm gonna, I'm gonna call.

74
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:47,960
Wow, I'm nervous.

75
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,340
I'm so nervous.

76
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,430
Oh, hello?

77
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,190
Hello?

78
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:57,990
Hello!

79
00:15:58,910 --> 00:15:59,650
Hello, hello.

80
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,050
How are you?

81
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,450
Good chat.

82
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:04,630
This is big bird

83
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:18,410
Yeah, I'm so nervous.

84
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:19,670
I'm so nervous.

85
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,710
I'm so nervous.

86
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:23,430
I'm because I should be doing nervous.

87
00:16:23,750 --> 00:17:43,090
Okay, because like I found out the person Yeah, because like I'm in baby tier, but then the person that like Someone dropped out and then they replace someone that's not baby and like all three characters apparently counter me because they all throw fucking fireballs so so i'm like what do i do when he told me your car you the characters you are facing are you i can don't uh are you i can the jury i was like are you sure you want to play haunted what else did i do I already practiced on the we have one and a half days left bird like I don't know if I can fit a third character in my head it's okay um one of them I think I think it's gonna work I think it's gonna you gotta believe so the real okay I would normally be scared of the real character the most because like fuck that fuck the flowchart um uh but but I think they're weak the player is on Ryo because like I watch I was scouting you know I watched his stream and he was doing a practice stream today and he still hasn't finished

88
00:17:43,090 --> 00:19:02,770
placements so I think I can beat and he was and he ended the stream fourth game placement so I think it's possible I can win it's I think I think I think it's very doable yeah we don't necessarily really doesn't counter honda especially at like you know beginner level yeah uh but he is gonna counter you if you only use you know headbutt yeah but like how would he know he'll think i use another move really who would use headbutt like 50 times in a row i think you should also use the the butt slam okay it's going to help you a lot there is a problem with that i'm i i might not be very consistent with the butt slam i'm i might be struggling with that one but but i know open up training wood okay okay okay it's it's look i'm i'm trying my best chat i i've got my nine game win streak without doing butt slam like well did you face any reuse did i face any what oh yeah i did i face any Yeah,

89
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:03,610
I faced the Rios.

90
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,350
They kicked my ass, but that's okay.

91
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:10,910
Because I beat one of them.

92
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,350
I remember beating one Rio.

93
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:14,090
And then I won in Dungeon.

94
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:18,410
You won in Dungeon, but you know you can't win in tournaments, right?

95
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:22,610
Yeah, but like that's not, that doesn't matter.

96
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,970
I think it matters a little bit.

97
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:26,570
No, they're not.

98
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:27,870
They won't adapt to me.

99
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:32,330
I believe they will never adapt.

100
00:19:32,350 --> 00:20:50,910
to me because like if you believe that then yeah yeah yeah it's fine they there's no way they can adapt to me all right also uh sound guy brought big bird up a little bit let me know if he's um if you guys can hear him now all right so basically what i do is i do this and then if i feel a little spicy i do this and then if they get close i just grab him and those are just three and then my fourth move is this so like apparently nephew says i'm like a pokemon so if i try to learn a fifth move i have to forget i have to forget one you have to forget one of them yeah we have to replace the other one so i i tried okay like yes i can do it in training but like in theory i can do it but i think i think this move is really good because it it will go through the fireball like if someone is spamming a duken you can do that goes through it and then you get a like a small combo out of it there's a cop what combo so if you put the dummy oh wait let me show you uh let me show my okay yeah okay yeah

101
00:20:50,910 --> 00:21:00,410
yeah you guys can't see the screen it's only for me only i get to see this so if someone

102
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:13,030
don't worry i'll try and replicate it chat on my own screen so it's not it's not going to be easy but yeah okay

103
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:55,410
what what oh oh yeah oh my god the little bounce the little bounce that you can combo but i'm not sure what if the combo is worth it for you but as long as you just get past the fireballs i think that's yeah yeah well how i do it is i just use this but then it does get my it does oh we're not that one but you know this to get past the fireball this is good but you also have the the level two super that goes through fireball as well oh wait how do i how How do I do that?

104
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:59,910
No, you just hold back and then you press your special button.

105
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:00,430
This one.

106
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,550
Yes, this one.

107
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:01,830
Oh!

108
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:03,510
This one goes through the fireball.

109
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:04,730
Okay, okay.

110
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:05,950
All right.

111
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:07,250
I got it.

112
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:08,650
I'll just use this.

113
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:11,110
Okay.

114
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:19,210
And then when you get close, then when you get close, you also have something else that you can do that you can just spam, which is, you know, which is perfect for you.

115
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:22,150
It shows your medium button.

116
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:22,710
Oh.

117
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:24,470
You're playing, yeah, this one.

118
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:30,970
This one, the good thing about it is it's plus and you can basically just spam this up close.

119
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:33,470
Wait, so I could just keep doing this?

120
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:36,770
Yeah, but like go back a bit.

121
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:38,830
Walk back a bit.

122
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:39,610
Yes, from this range.

123
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:40,510
This range.

124
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:41,570
Oh my god!

125
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,390
My arms are so long!

126
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:45,130
It's so good.

127
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,010
Oh my god!

128
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:48,910
Even like top players actually hate this button.

129
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:49,710
Oh, okay.

130
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,470
Oh my god, this is my new.

131
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:54,790
It's headbutt, headbutt, and this.

132
00:22:54,810 --> 00:23:26,510
you can do this into uh the 100 hand slap 100 hand slap wait how do i oh it's the one with a lot of hands yeah so you can do the medium into that oh like yeah basically but like that yes oh my god my new spammable move they'll never expect this move so the hand the hundred hand slap is uh is minus so It's not your turn obviously after that.

133
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:28,210
Wait, what does minus mean?

134
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:29,370
Oh, sorry.

135
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,570
I'm being too complicated here.

136
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:33,370
So basically it's not your turn anymore.

137
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,870
It's basically not your turn anymore.

138
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:35,710
They block it.

139
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,610
It's like...

140
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:37,210
So you need to...

141
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:40,590
Yeah, you need to be careful what button you press after that.

142
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:41,050
Okay.

143
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:41,510
Okay, okay.

144
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:47,310
But this one, the media punch is like you...

145
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:49,610
It's your turn afterwards, even on block.

146
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,030
Even if they block it.

147
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:52,110
Okay.

148
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:54,790
So maybe it's not worth it to cancel something.

149
00:23:54,810 --> 00:24:28,890
times you know just keep doing the the media punch oh so just keep doing this yes this is good for spam okay uh until they show you that they can you know deal with it then you might you're gonna have to change it up a bit okay so when you get when you get them knocked down with when you get like knock someone down with the headbutt or whatever then you have the medium punch you have this this throw that you can use yeah uh you have your drive impact the one that you know the And then you have your regular throw.

150
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:31,750
Yes, this.

151
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:34,430
This one is good because it's safe.

152
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,910
Like, they can't punish you if they jump over you.

153
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:39,790
And if they jump over you, you can use your headbutts.

154
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:45,110
Oh, wait, but then like, I missed though.

155
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:47,290
What do you mean?

156
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:53,470
So like, so when they jump over me, like, they just, the headbutt doesn't hit.

157
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:58,750
So there's this thing in this game called autocorrect.

158
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:07,110
If they jump over you and you still do the moves, sometimes the move, the Honda goes to the other side.

159
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:11,790
So it auto-corrects for you where he's going.

160
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:12,970
Okay, okay.

161
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:14,010
Yeah.

162
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:18,470
But it's not necessarily they jump to the other side.

163
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:22,890
Sometimes they just jump in their place, you know, to avoid the command throw.

164
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:24,170
Yeah, yeah.

165
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:27,430
So they start jumping, I should just continue headbutton.

166
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:32,010
You can just continue medium punching, or you can just do regular throw.

167
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:33,970
So they don't punish your...

168
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:36,170
Because if you do the other throw...

169
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:37,330
This one?

170
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:37,890
No, the other throw?

171
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:38,270
Yes.

172
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:39,850
No, no, not this one.

173
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:40,150
The other one.

174
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:40,710
Oh, not this one.

175
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,350
Oh, this one.

176
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:44,470
Yes, if they jump over this, they can punish you.

177
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:46,110
Oh, okay, so I should just do that.

178
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:47,490
Yes.

179
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,350
Like, switch it up between the two.

180
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:50,210
Yeah, when you get close.

181
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:52,170
Basically, yeah.

182
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

183
00:25:54,810 --> 00:26:52,050
combo the other so like for example the media punch hits do the media punch you can do you can do crowd jab afterwards uh you're playing controller right yeah i'm on the i'm on the uh the razor one but it has the playstation controller icons uh is that a leverless or no regular leverless yeah oh leverless so you're basically your first button what uh uh square triangle x square triangle x oh okay we don't we don't we don't say square triangle x square this is square yes yes so if you do the triangle button yeah no just do that triangle yeah that's your triangle that's your triangle that's a level square triangle uh x oh okay

184
00:26:55,330 --> 00:27:26,830
so if you do the X you can do down square afterward this close yet close oh it combos oh my god he's pushing me away yeah well obviously it's gonna push you away so you can't do it infinitely it's not fair well if it's if you can do it infinitely it doesn't push you away we should give Honda infinite infinite slaps so I'll give you a little combo so Let me share my screen to make it easier.

185
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:30,450
Okay, so...

186
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:32,390
Wait, maybe we should go in a custom room.

187
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:34,790
No, it's gonna be laggy.

188
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:35,750
It's gonna be very laggy.

189
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:39,350
Okay, do you see my screen?

190
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:41,090
Yeah, I see a chat.

191
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:43,050
Okay, so basically...

192
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:44,750
What the fuck?

193
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:46,510
That's...

194
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:49,050
What did you do?

195
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:50,910
This?

196
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:52,610
It's just what I told you.

197
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,070
Oh, it's like this?

198
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:55,650
Yeah.

199
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:58,770
Oh my god, guys, I'm doing a combo!

200
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,470
Oh my god, I'm not doing a combo.

201
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:03,830
Okay, slow down a bit.

202
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:06,850
Don't get too excited.

203
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:08,870
I got too excited, guys.

204
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:10,630
Like that?

205
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:13,870
Yeah, but yes, this one, exactly.

206
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:17,710
So even, so let me tell you on the secret.

207
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:22,890
Even on hit or on block, you can just do this because it's your turn either way.

208
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:24,190
Wow.

209
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:26,890
Okay.

210
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:28,930
But you have to get close.

211
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:29,590
Oh.

212
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:33,870
What?

213
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:36,250
But how do I keep doing it if I miss?

214
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:38,130
Never mind.

215
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:38,870
Yeah, you're missing it.

216
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:39,530
No, it's okay.

217
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,570
It's something you're gonna get used to.

218
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:43,670
Oh.

219
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:44,010
Yeah.

220
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:48,490
Oh.

221
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:51,250
Wait, but do I have to move closer after?

222
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,890
Like, do I have to move up?

223
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:54,810
Yeah, you have to move up.

224
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:55,790
Oh, okay.

225
00:28:56,370 --> 00:29:04,130
100 hand slap it's gonna push you away and then after you do the 100 hand slap yeah if you're actually close wait

226
00:29:08,380 --> 00:30:20,340
how's okay wait oh no uh basically just keep doing this as well oh so i could just this is very good okay yeah this is very good and then you can if you feel like it you can cancel into you know headbutt afterwards oh and then just do that yeah basically after after you uh your x button oh after my oh no i'm too slow uh look look on my screen okay so like this just do this and then oh wait no guys even a pro messes up i don't play on modern that's the thing i mean i'm getting used to that you don't play on modern when it's the easiest it's the easiest mode no no no it's not about easy it's about a different layout yeah sure yo you don't have to expose you like that excuses oh pro player can't play on modern

227
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,780
don't make me practice modern for a day

228
00:30:32,940 --> 00:31:05,520
okay okay uh okay what else uh so if someone jumps over you wait but you didn't do the thing you were trying to teach me the thing but you couldn't do it i showed you oh wait i showed you this it is okay oh okay like make them block a few more and then you can just do headbutts afterwards okay headbutts oh like that something like that yeah oh my god okay i have to hold it So this is like this is like basically that you see this button that you're pressing.

229
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,760
Yeah This is basically what you do in real life anyway, which is bullying.

230
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:15,980
Yeah So you're gonna want to bully so you're gonna want to bully them in the corner.

231
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,620
Oh my god, I'm doing it

232
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:24,850
This is one of your best buttons.

233
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:25,210
Okay.

234
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:30,650
Yeah, so if someone jumps over you yeah Someone tries to jump at you.

235
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:31,990
Do you know what to do?

236
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:37,060
What is that?

237
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:43,300
If someone jumps and you want to stop them from jumping, do you know what to do?

238
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,240
Oh, headbutt.

239
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,540
Yes, you have headbutt and you also have your this button.

240
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,560
Look at my screen.

241
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,340
Why the fuck?

242
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,760
Oh, it's my...

243
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,000
Oh.

244
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,620
This one also stops them from jumping.

245
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:58,540
Okay.

246
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,600
So this is anti-air.

247
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:02,880
Yes.

248
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,680
This one and your headbutt.

249
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:53,660
obviously headbutt is better but sometimes you know you're not walking back enough so you're not charging for the headbutt so this is good this is also spammable button as well you can just oh my god that's my favorite for far range for far range look how far it reaches oh oh it's pretty far yes but but the problem is it doesn't push you forward like his other button that i told you about that you can spam the the x button yeah yeah yeah this one move more moves them forward so it's good to walk into the distance the other one is just in place oh yeah get it i'm trying to see what other buttons he has oh yeah you also have the down the down heavy punch How did you do that?

250
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,060
Oh, this.

251
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,000
Yeah, it's just down this.

252
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,480
When do I use this?

253
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,680
This one's also good.

254
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:08,560
This one, it's basically the same, has the same concept as the X button because it moves them forward.

255
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,500
So if you're far in range, you can just, you can do this.

256
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,280
Look how far it reaches.

257
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,500
Look at the range of it.

258
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,800
Oh my God, it's so far.

259
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:22,080
And on, on counter hits.

260
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,680
It can combo into this.

261
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,640
This is my new alley kick, guys.

262
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,100
Break their ankles.

263
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,420
Yes, this is a low as well, yes, which is good.

264
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,300
I think it's a low, if I'm not mistaken.

265
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:43,820
I hope so.

266
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,560
I'm fucking beating up his shoe.

267
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:50,620
I hope it's a low.

268
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,060
This is also good if they like to walk back a lot.

269
00:33:55,580 --> 00:34:03,940
So you have this button and then you have the medium punch, which you use for bullying.

270
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,000
And then you have the headbutts.

271
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,460
Why am I watching for the YouTube?

272
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:09,900
Okay.

273
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:10,580
Yes.

274
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:16,800
So these four buttons are the ones you're going to use to bully someone in the corner or just in the mid-screen.

275
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:17,120
In the corner.

276
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:17,500
Okay.

277
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,380
Or even outside of the corner.

278
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:20,440
All right.

279
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,080
I got it.

280
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,660
I understand.

281
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:30,300
Now what we need to do is I want to see you actually apply these moves.

282
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,520
Okay, I don't understand.

283
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,640
In a match.

284
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,940
What do you know what you don't understand about it?

285
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,920
Maybe I don't understand.

286
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,300
No, no, it's okay.

287
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:41,800

Yes.

331
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:39,340
Yes.

332
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,460
Oh my god.

00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:50,140
Okay.

338
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,980
You know, it was a good attempt.

339
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,700
You were fucked up, but you fucked up.

340
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,560
No, I don't want to.

341
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:58,740
She's not gold.

342
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,300
She's not, no, no.

343
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,100
All right, all right.

344
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:01,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

345
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:08,840
So you have a get off me move that you can use if someone is pressuring you too much, which is your level one super.

346
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,040
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

347
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,260

Yeah, the L.

349
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,100
This one is a get off me move.

350
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:20,980
So if someone is pressuring you too much and you on wake up, then you just wake up with this.

351
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:23,380
Okay.

No, you need to chill on the EX1.

356
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,340
EX1 is punishable.

357
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:34,020
Okay, but what if I just do this?

358
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:34,780

374
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:28,920

00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:35,820
No, it's fine.

381
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,860
There's no way I can miss it again.

382
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:40,080
Oh.

383
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,300
Whoops.

384
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,640
Not mean to do that.

385
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:43,560
That's fine.

386
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,240
Don't worry.

387
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,140
I got the slap.

388
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,160

Oh, come on.

394
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:27,650
Well, we could do this forever.

395
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:29,270
Yeah, we could do this forever.

396
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,050
You can't do it forever.

397
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:33,190
Guys, I can't do it forever.

398
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:37,790
I don't understand.

399
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:40,150
But what if I do this?

400
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,070
I mean, it can work.

401
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:42,790
Oh.

402
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:45,450
That's right.

403
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:47,450
Oh my god, wait!

404
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:48,210
Watch this!

405
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,130
Get out of here!

406
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:52,830
That's right.

407
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:55,770
Can't do this in classic.

408
00:39:57,170 --> 00:40:00,850
I think you can, but that's beside the topic here.

409
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:03,690
Oh shit, okay.

410
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:07,050
Oh no, wait.

411
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:08,730
Didn't like that.

412
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:10,290
So now you don't need to do anything.

413
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:12,250
You just wait for her to do something.

414
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:12,870
Okay.

415
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:15,670
Block low as well.

416
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:16,490
Don't forget to block low.

417
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:17,030
Oh.

418
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:19,350
Oh.

419
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:23,770
Oh my god, what the fuck is she doing?

420
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:49,810
to me bro no oh my god yes keep doing the semi-de-punch keep doing the semi-de-punch i'm trying okay nice you almost threw there not gonna lie i just wanted to i don't like her i don't want all right all right pause the pause the search for a bit okay okay

421
00:40:53,790 --> 00:42:09,710
more exciting i did okay so so when i tell you to use this yeah i don't mean i don't mean for you to go to this as well because this your turn is still alive yeah but if you do this that's and then it's no longer your turn okay no longer your turn meaning you have to block afterwards okay so after i do this i have to block after you do the hundred hand slap yes you have to block okay but if you do the set mini punch only we're gonna call that set mini punch yeah uh you're fine you don't you can do this into jab into whatever uh now i see that you have an issue like if someone knocks you down you tend to panic and you tend to press whatever yeah uh that's me try to yeah try to block more on wake up try to block more you know like i had like a 30 percent defense less yeah just try to block a bit on wake up so uh you don't lose a lot of life if you don't want to block and wake up yeah use the ex the ex headbutt wake up with it oh wait no not that this this one or use the level one super

422
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:21,330
oh if you don't want to block and wake up yeah this okay yes but like i said the ex headbutt it's good to wake up with it but it's not good to use you know randomly out of nowhere because

423
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:26,770
Yeah, so be careful when you use it.

424
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:28,370
Got it.

425
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:30,170
That's right.

426
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:32,790
But what if I just...

427
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:33,030
Oh, yeah.

428
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:33,330
I forgot.

429
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:35,910
I was like, why am I not getting a game yet?

430
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:37,910
No, I told you to pause it.

431
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:41,270
But...

432
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:43,990
Okay, so how do you do this?

433
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:45,950
On wake up, yes.

434
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:46,450
Yeah, yeah.

435
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:48,570
Because if you feel like the pressure is too much.

436
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:51,710
Because they'll think I block, but then I'll surprise them.

437
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:52,650
Exactly.

438
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:53,450
Yeah, yeah.

439
00:42:53,790 --> 00:43:24,110
be like there's no way she won't block and then i'll just do this yes that or the level one so okay got it oh no ken oh no fuck your flow charts oh my god he's cold just six game win streak oh you're it's okay they won't expect this watch this all right he has a fireball this is good practice for you oh god oh god not Oh,

440
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:24,310
no.

441
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:25,110
She punished you.

442
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:26,810
Okay, it's fine.

443
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:28,270
Yes.

444
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:29,530
Oh, shit.

445
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:33,310
That's how you- I know you want to jump.

446
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:34,230
Oh, wait.

447
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:34,870
Okay.

448
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:36,170
Come on.

449
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:38,750
Oh, oh my god.

450
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:39,890
That's not bad.

451
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:40,570
You switched corners.

452
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:41,270
That's good.

453
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:41,550
That's good.

454
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:42,110
That's my corner.

455
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:43,810
This is my corner.

456
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:45,970
What the f- Oh, no.

457
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:47,190
Jumped over you.

458
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:48,970
That's right.

459
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:49,750
Get off me!

460
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:50,370
That worked out.

461
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:52,670
And then- Oh my god, that's not what I wanted.

462
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:57,400
Oh my god, what?

463
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,540
Oh my god, he grabbed me!

464
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,620
Oh my god, he grabbed me again!

465
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
It's okay, I grabbed him!

466
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,160
I grabbed him!

467
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:08,860
Oh!

468
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,140
Oh no!

469
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:12,120
Okay, I...

470
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,020
Look, he has like six wins.

471
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:14,900
I have one.

472
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,340
You might have to pull out your secret weapon, your butt slam.

473
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,140
Oh, true!

474
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:19,440
Okay, wait me.

475
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,400
Okay, it missed.

476
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,880
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

477
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,240
As long as you didn't punish it, it's okay.

478
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:25,480
It's okay.

479
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:26,980
Oh, what?

480
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:27,720
Okay, it's fine.

481
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:28,080
It's fine.

482
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:29,680
It's fine.

483
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:33,000
You're not expecting this, are you?

484
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:34,540
That's right.

485
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,140
You're doing good.

486
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:37,480
Because I don't expect it either.

487
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:38,840
Chill with the EX.

488
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:41,940
Watch this.

489
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:42,400
Oh, shit.

490
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,380
Don't watch it.

491
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:45,180
I'm watching.

492
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:45,960
I'm still watching.

493
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:46,660
It's okay.

494
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:47,980
Oh, my God.

495
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:48,400
Wait.

496
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:49,080
Oh, shit.

497
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:49,500
Okay.

498
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,180
He jumped over.

499
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:52,600
I wasn't expecting that.

500
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,880
Um, this is not...

501
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:59,580
No, you're fine, you're fine, you're fine, you're fine, you're fine.

502
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:00,980
Um, um...

503
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,060
I don't feel fat...

504
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:04,240
Oh.

505
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:05,340
No!

506
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:06,100
No!

507
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:07,200
No!

508
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,380
That was close.

509
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,940
How come I wasn't fine?

510
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:15,160
I guess.

511
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:19,080
You were fine for a bit until you weren't anymore.

512
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:19,740
I don't want him to fire me.

513
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:21,700
I don't want him to fire.

514
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:22,580
Okay, so I...

515
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,820
I noticed you have an issue with jumping.

516
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:25,680
Yeah.

517
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:26,280
Yeah.

518
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,300
You're not anti-airing properly.

519
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:29,380
Yeah.

520
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,540
So if your headbutt is not working, then use this button.

521
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:36,360
This button is easier.

522
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:38,620
This one is much easier than using headbutt.

523
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:39,820
Push this one.

524
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:40,340
Oh.

525
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:40,940
Yes.

526
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:41,600
Okay.

527
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,080
It will stop him completely from jumping.

528
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:44,960
No, this one you need to use headbutt.

529
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:45,380
Okay.

530
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,260
That's always him again.

531
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:48,820
Lasagna.

532
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:50,500
I remember you.

533
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:51,700
Oh, that's him.

534
00:45:53,240 --> 00:46:20,180
all right she won't expect this how come she expected it well she didn't because she didn't punish you that's right my coach taught me that that's right all right i didn't teach you that okay that's our favorite time in this

535
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,100
Oh, oh my god, that's fucked.

536
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,400
Okay, you deserve this ring.

537
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:31,880
Okay, nice.

538
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:33,860
What?

539
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:37,180
Okay, he's smurfing, he's smurfing.

540
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,880
Okay, okay, how are you here?

541
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:41,060
How are you?

542
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:42,800
How are you in?

543
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:43,700
How are you here?

544
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:50,860
All right, so what he's doing right now is basically just waiting for you to press something and then he just reacts.

545
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,620
So what you're gonna do now is you're not gonna press anything.

546
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:54,640
Yeah, that's right.

547
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:54,960
I'll wait.

548
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:57,000
And use buttons only.

549
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:57,920
Don't use specials.

550
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:02,980
That's right.

551
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:03,800
My turn.

552
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:05,780
My turn to react.

553
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:15,320
Yes, when you see him too comfortable and walking, just do your headbutts.

554
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:17,960
Oops.

555
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,120
Bro, your range is so high!

556
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,840
Why do you have such long arms?

557
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:29,300
You have longer arms, you know, you just need to use them.

558
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:29,940
Nice.

559
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:30,440
See?

560
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:32,520
My arms are so short.

561
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:34,660
He's getting frustrated.

562
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:35,980
Now he's going to want to go in.

563
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:36,140
Yeah, that's right.

564
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:36,640
I can.

565
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:37,520
Oh, my God.

566
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:38,540
Oh, my God.

567
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:39,460
Oh, my God.

568
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:44,350
Oh, oh, oh.

569
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:46,530
I didn't dodge it.

570
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:49,870
Okay, you're fine.

571
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:50,590
You're fine.

572
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:52,250
Oh, my God.

573
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:52,510
I don't feel...

574
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:53,310
Careful from the drive impact.

575
00:47:54,070 --> 00:47:54,470
Oh.

576
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:57,270
Oh.

577
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:00,210
No!

578
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:01,430
No!

579
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:02,970
It's fine!

580
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:03,890
No!

581
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:05,570
It's not fine!

582
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:06,710
It's not fine!

583
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:12,630
Okay, I'll do one more again.

584
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:13,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

585
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:15,210
It's fine.

586
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:16,510
It'll be fine.

587
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:20,030
Oh.

588
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:22,150
I can- I am patient.

589
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:26,840
Oh, what the fuck?

590
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:28,400
Can you see your charging?

591
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:29,240
Just wait.

592
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:30,680
Just okay.

593
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:31,320
Okay, nice.

594
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:33,320
I'm gonna be burnt out.

595
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,200
Oh, never mind.

596
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:35,760
Oh, never mind.

597
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:36,640
Oh, you're burned out.

598
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:37,820
Never, oh, never mind.

599
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:41,160
Oh, you're fine.

600
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:41,660
You're fine now.

601
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:42,400
Okay, I'm fine.

602
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:44,940
Yes.

603
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:45,820
Yes.

604
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,240
Oh, I couldn't get the head.

605
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:49,720
Nice.

606
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:50,560
I got it.

607
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,820
Don't forget the butt and the head's the shoes.

608
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,380
Yeah, yeah.

609
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:55,980
Oh, shit.

610
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:57,660
Oh, change your shoes first.

611
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,300
Yeah, she got me first.

612
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:00,960
Wait, she got me first.

613
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:02,380
I think she's listening to me.

614
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:02,820
Yeah.

615
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:03,900
Wait, that's illegal.

616
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:04,600
She's streaming.

617
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:06,420
She's streaming.

618
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:08,900
She's streaming.

619
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:11,280
This is my coaching session.

620
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:15,060
She's listening to me before you.

621
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:15,620
Bro.

622
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:17,260
Get out of here.

623
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:17,940
Get out.

624
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,060
That's the key.

625
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,220
That's right.

626
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,140
Get out of here.

627
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,940
Now you have a big life lead.

628
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,660
You should not lose this.

629
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:26,140
Oh, no.

630
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:27,740
Every time you say that, I lose this.

631
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:30,000
Okay, okay, no.

632
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:31,640
Do I have to say the opposite?

633
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,660
Do I have to say, okay, okay, you're gonna lose this.

634
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, just be like, lose it, lose it.

635
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:36,620
And then I'll be like, I'll show you.

636
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,480
I'll show everyone.

637
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,560
Oh my god, oh my god, look what you did.

638
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,260
Look what you did.

639
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:46,140
Alright, now...

640
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:46,220
Okay.

641
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:48,220
Careful from the drive impact.

642
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:49,100
He's gonna drive impact.

643
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:50,200
See what I told you.

644
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:51,720
He's so smart.

645
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:53,560
Oh my god!

646
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,980
Get me out of here!

647
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,280
Oh, do I... No!

648
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:57,740
What?

649
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:58,740
Are you blind?

650
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,720
What's wrong with you?

651
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,600
All right.

652
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:14,120
So I noticed that in this match that you played, yeah, he's like, you're not reacting to drive impact.

653
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:14,920
Yeah.

654
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:18,860
So when someone does drive impact, you can obviously drive impact back.

655
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:20,180
Yeah, I can drive impact back.

656
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:24,500
And if you're burnt out, obviously you can't drive impact anymore.

657
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:26,560
You have to use your level one super.

658
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:28,000
Yeah.

659
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:29,020
Okay.

660
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,580
That's your only way of escaping driving tracks.

661
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:38,900
Now what I need you to do is sometimes when you're getting pressured too much, do not use specials.

662
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:39,220
Okay.

663
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,760
Try to use, try to use your jab, your button, this one.

664
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:43,220
This one.

665
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:43,640
This one.

666
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:47,560
And you can go into headbutts as well.

667
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:49,420
I got this.

668
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:50,160
Like this.

669
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:52,380
Try to use your jabs more.

670
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:53,120
Okay.

671
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:55,420
Oh my god.

672
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:56,940
Even after, even after headbutts.

673
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:58,460
It's hard to use jab.

674
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,040
That's right.

675
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:00,600
Like this.

676
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,420
I'm jabbing.

677
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,960
My coach is teaching me how to jab.

678
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,800
Oh, oh, oh.

679
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:08,360
Oh, no.

680
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:09,680
No, I couldn't react.

681
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:10,320
Okay.

682
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:12,780
That wasn't a combo.

683
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:13,300
That's right.

684
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,180
Wait, this guy combo.

685
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:15,900
That's illegal.

686
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:17,120
What the fuck?

687
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:17,860
We're silver.

688
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,440
What's wrong with you?

689
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:23,640
Oh, I told you they're listening to me.

690
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:24,840
What the fuck?

691
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:26,540
This is my coaching session.

692
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:59,000

693
00:51:59,300 --> 00:51:59,460
That's fine.

694
00:51:59,600 --> 00:51:59,880
Stop looking.

695
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:00,860
Stop looking.

696
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:01,880
Stop looking.

697
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:03,700
Okay.

698
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:06,800
No, I pressed it too.

699
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:07,700
No, you can't.

700
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:08,060
You can't.

701
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:08,780
Oh, I can't?

702
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:09,220
Okay.

703
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:09,900
Yeah.

704
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:10,980
It was a punish.

705
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:13,740
Bro, what the fuck?

706
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:17,120
I swear to God, offline gaming was so easy.

707
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:19,380
Okay.

708
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:20,420
That's it.

709
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:22,000
I'm gonna use this as my helmet.

710
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:22,800
What?

711
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:28,880
Oh.

712
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:29,420
Oh.

713
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:31,220
Oh.

714
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:31,900
Oh my god, stop!

715
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:32,540
Stop!

716
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:37,940
You can just press your jab button there.

717
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:39,680
I feel when you block it.

718
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:39,980
Okay.

719
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:42,240
Because it's not their turn anymore, it's your turn after that.

720
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:46,260
Yeah?

721
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:47,600
Okay.

722
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:48,040
Okay.

723
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:50,520
No!

724
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:51,160
What the?

725
00:52:55,730 --> 00:52:56,250
Yeah.

726
00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:00,590
Oh no, I didn't expect that.

727
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:02,530
What?

728
00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:04,590
I didn't!

729
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:06,130
Okay, it's fine.

730
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:07,510
It's fine.

731
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:09,470
I hate you, but it's fine.

732
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:10,670
It's fine.

733
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:10,930
It's fine.

734
00:53:11,370 --> 00:53:11,710
You're fine.

735
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:13,090
I'm so... I'm not.

736
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:14,230
I'm not fine.

737
00:53:15,010 --> 00:53:15,310
I'm not.

738
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:15,710
I'm not.

739
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:17,150
Just don't panic.

740
00:53:17,550 --> 00:53:18,110
Just don't panic.

741
00:53:18,350 --> 00:53:19,010
I'm panicking.

742
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:21,650
Oh!

743
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:22,950
Too far.

744

Oh my god.

745
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:28,940
I'm not charging it.

746
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:29,680

It's not okay.

799
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:37,510
It's not okay.

800
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:38,270
It's not okay.

801
00:56:38,870 --> 00:56:39,150
Okay.

802
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:43,750
Okay.

Okay.

00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:45,890
Oh, not that.

806
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:48,050
I was trying to do the butt slam, but it didn't work.

807
00:56:49,850 --> 00:56:50,130
Stop!

808
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:53,290
Stop!

Okay, she knows.

Oh my god, wait.

Oh my god.

00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:08,700
It might be dead.

815
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:10,740
Oh no, you're not dead.

816
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,020
I'm dead now.

817
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:12,440
He's gonna drive impact.

818
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:14,780
Please don't drive impact me.

819
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:16,020
What?

820
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:16,560
No, no.

821
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:18,400
Do your level 2 super.

822
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:18,980
You can do...

823
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:20,020
Okay, that's too late.

824
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:20,760
Oh, it's too late.

825
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:21,300
It's too late.

826
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:22,400
Oh, my God.

827
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:23,100
And it's poison.

828
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:24,240
And it's poison.

829
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:24,680
Okay.

830
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:25,380
It's winnable.

831
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:25,980
It's winnable.

832
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:26,840
Is it?

833
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:31,980
Okay, never mind.

834
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:38,460
You gave me super confidence.

835
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:41,300
So, I mean, that's what I have to do.

836
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:42,260
I have to give you confidence.

837
00:57:44,780 --> 00:58:18,160
You know what you're doing with your EX when you're burning out too fast it's like the equivalent of when you play marvel rivals and you burn all your cooldowns in one second yeah and then you defend those that's basically what you're doing but like what if i win though what the fuck give me my entire air get out oh yes okay there you go nice i don't understand it's like Offstream,

838
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:26,260
I was fighting the most stupid people and then like everyone is like fucking The next prodigies of street fighting.

839
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:27,220
Oh, I burned out.

840
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,240
Oh my god, and he fucking okay.

841
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:29,860

842
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:30,480
That's cool

843
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:40,260
You're panicking too much.

844
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:42,140
Okay All right.

845
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:42,980
All right.

846
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:43,860
No more panic.

847
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:44,760
I'm panicking

848
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:51,980
Jesus Christ, all he does is jump.

849
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:56,260
All he does is this is what...

850
00:58:56,260 --> 00:58:57,480
What is he doing?

851
00:58:58,300 --> 00:58:59,560
Oh my god!

852
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:01,340
Okay, there you go.

853
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:02,960
There you go.

854
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:04,140
You can't jump forever.

855
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:04,320
Right.

856
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:05,360
That's right.

857
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:06,360
Yes, exactly.

858
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:07,100
You can't jump forever.

859
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:08,780
That's right.

860
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,320
But you can jump as well.

861
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:12,780
You want to jump?

862
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:13,680
I know you do.

863
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:14,760
Oh my... what?

864
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:17,960
Oh.

865
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:20,560
Oh, no!

866
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,080
Make sure I have it back!

867
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:22,800
Oh, he's gonna punish them for that.

868
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:23,900
He's gonna punish them for that.

869
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:24,420
Nice!

870
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:26,360
Get out of here!

871
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:29,220
Now if he jumps, I need you to do the super.

872
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:31,540
I can't...

873
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:32,560
Oh, I can't!

874
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:33,160
Alright!

875
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:36,140
Oh, he could have blacked out.

876
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:39,020
Okay, okay, wait.

877
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:40,220
I figured it out.

878
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:42,440
I figured it out.

879
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:43,800
Oh, my God.

880
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:45,120
He figured it out, too.

881
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:49,140
Ooh.

882
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:50,340
Jesus, crap.

883
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:51,480
Here you go.

884
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:53,640
Here you go.

885
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:54,340
Okay.

886
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:55,660
They're going to jump again.

887
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:56,120
Yes.

888
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:57,200
Come on.

889
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:57,980
You know you want it.

890
00:59:58,540 --> 00:59:58,940
Okay.

891
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:02,480
Oh, my God.

892
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:02,800
Okay.

893
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:03,720
That's fine.

894
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:04,760
Oh, what the?

895
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:05,960
That's right.

896
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:07,220
You can punish that.

897
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:08,820
When he does the two kicks, you can punish him.

898
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:09,420
Two kicks?

899
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:09,980
Okay.

01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:10,620

Why is for him to jump?

01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:09,960
But he gotta jump.

948
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:10,840

There you go.

955
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:47,000

I just know these.

957
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:57,560
No, this is working, actually.

958
01:02:57,740 --> 01:02:58,320
This is crazy.

959
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:00,380
How long it's working, don't change it.

960
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:01,320
Exactly.

01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:04,800
Exactly.

01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:06,360
Exactly.

01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:07,600
Look at that.

964
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:09,500
Oh, whoa.

965
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:11,880
I did not think he was gonna do that.

966
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:12,520
Oh!

967
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:14,720
No, it's not working.

968
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:16,140
I need you to not panic on wake up.

01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:17,560
Block.

972
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:21,120
Um.

973
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,700
He's, he's doing stuff to me.

974
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:27,520
He's doing stuff and it's all working.

975
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:29,620
Punish that.

976
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:30,280
No!

977
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:31,760
No, you could have punished that.

978
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:32,760
I don't!

979
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:36,880
Just press your medium punch.

980
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,640
To punish that, just press your medium punch.

981
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:39,020
Okay.

982
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:41,220
Like it does the suitcase.

983
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:42,220
Okay.

984
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:45,100
What?

985
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:46,420
Okay.

986
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:51,240
Oh my god.

987
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:52,340
You're so...

988
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:53,220
Oh my god.

989
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:54,980
No.

990
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:55,940
Oh my god.

991
01:03:57,620 --> 01:03:59,020
Oh my god.

992
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:00,700
Okay, okay.

993
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:01,400
This is still winnable.

994
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:02,020
This is still winnable.

995
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:03,540
Oh.

996
01:04:04,860 --> 01:04:05,340
No!

997
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:06,120
No!

998
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:08,240
No!

999
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:09,680
He jumped!

1000
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:13,920
He's burned out.

1001
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:17,020
Okay, you can use your level two super.

1002
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:19,260
Oh, no.

1003
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:19,520
No, I didn't.

1004
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:19,700
You can use your level two super.

1005
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:20,900
No, I didn't have health enough for the armor.

1006
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:22,240
No, I didn't have enough health.

1007
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:28,020
I will say, you did say I will win this and then that usually means I wouldn't win.

1008
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:28,880
No, no.

1009
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:30,320
I said it's winnable.

1010
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:31,760
I did not say you will win this.

1011
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:32,960
There's a difference.

1012
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:58,760

Why did they all leave me?

1015
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:06,900
Okay.

1016
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:10,520
Oh, what about my grab?

Why does he get to grab me?

1022
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:29,780

01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:32,200
Oh, it's not fair.

1024

1242
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:49,560
Stop!

1243
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:53,160
Oh my god, she didn't stop.

1254
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:09,320
I did it.

1255
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:09,800
I did it.

1256
01:20:11,620 --> 01:20:13,320
No jaywalking allowed.

1257
01:20:13,900 --> 01:20:14,620
That's right.

1258
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:15,480

01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,680
I don't like you.

1262
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:27,060
Stop.

1263
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:27,840
Yes, exactly.

1264
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:29,100
Stop.

01:20:30,860 --> 01:20:32,800
Oh, that was amazing.

1266
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:35,660
Oh, yeah.

1267
01:20:35,940 --> 01:20:36,640
That's not fair.

1268
01:20:38,620 --> 01:20:39,880
I don't...

1269
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:41,200
Don't come close to me!

1270
01:20:42,740 --> 01:20:43,180

That's right, get your ankles out of here.

1277
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:04,340
Oh, oh, oh, that's right.

1278

Oh, you don't want to.

01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:05,520
That's fine.

1378
01:25:05,820 --> 01:25:06,800

01:30:11,390 --> 01:30:12,410
Pick Ryu, pick Ryu.

1449
01:30:13,390 --> 01:30:15,130
How do I change Jamie?

1450
01:30:19,030 --> 01:30:20,410
Why do we collect here?

1451
01:30:20,650 --> 01:30:21,610
Oh, it's character select.

01:30:27,350 --> 01:30:28,310
That's the wrong guy.

1455
01:30:28,370 --> 01:30:29,150
Where the fuck is that?

1456
01:30:29,330 --> 01:30:32,490
I just need you to record him knocking you down.

1457
01:30:32,690 --> 01:30:32,830
That's it.

1458
01:30:34,310 --> 01:30:35,610
Go Honda, go Honda Honda.

No, just go Honda for me to make it easier.

Okay.

1464
01:30:43,770 --> 01:30:44,650
Because you know all his buttons.

1465
01:30:45,190 --> 01:30:47,390
Wait, how come Honda doesn't even have...

1466
01:30:48,370 --> 01:30:50,050
Honda doesn't even have modern on the dummy?

1467
01:30:51,490 --> 01:30:52,710
I mean, because he's the dummy.

1468
01:30:54,330 --> 01:30:56,090
Oh, I say classic players.

1469
01:30:57,130 --> 01:30:58,970

01:31:07,950 --> 01:31:08,410
Oh, yeah.

1476
01:31:09,230 --> 01:31:10,770

All right.

1482
01:31:16,290 --> 01:31:20,990
No, I just need you to record them knocking you down.

1483
01:31:21,150 --> 01:31:21,990
Wait, what the fuck?

1484
01:31:23,030 --> 01:31:23,810
Press Honda.

1485
01:31:24,150 --> 01:31:24,750
Yes, change this.

1486
01:31:24,950 --> 01:31:25,690
Yes, I'll go.

1487
01:31:26,190 --> 01:31:26,890
Oh, there we go.

1488
01:31:27,350 --> 01:31:27,630
Okay.

1489
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:28,050
All right.

1490
01:31:28,170 --> 01:31:29,450
Now we can record.

1491
01:31:29,690 --> 01:31:30,590
Oh, not that.

1492
01:31:31,410 --> 01:31:32,710

Yes, now go back.

1496
01:32:09,270 --> 01:32:11,270
Okay, so when you press a button now.

1497
01:32:11,930 --> 01:32:12,510
Press a button.

1498
01:32:12,510 --> 01:32:13,110
Oh, my God.

1499
01:32:13,310 --> 01:32:13,890
Yeah, she's going to knock you down.

1500
01:32:14,130 --> 01:32:14,830
She's going to knock you down.

1501
01:32:15,990 --> 01:32:18,690
Now, when you get knocked down, I need to press yes, see.

1502
01:32:21,490 --> 01:32:21,850
Whoops.

1503
01:32:22,770 --> 01:32:23,170
I don't know.

1504
01:32:23,270 --> 01:32:24,110
You have to get knocked down.

1505
01:32:24,390 --> 01:32:24,490
You have to get knocked down.

1506
01:32:24,510 --> 01:32:24,690
Yeah, yeah.

1507
01:32:24,910 --> 01:32:25,270
Whoa.

1508
01:32:26,110 --> 01:32:28,350
See, now you wake up a bit further behind.

1509
01:32:28,490 --> 01:32:33,150
So when Tommy was spamming you with grabs, there was a way to get out of that by doing this.

1510
01:32:33,950 --> 01:32:34,350
Okay.

1511
01:32:34,490 --> 01:32:37,170
Instead of waking up in your place so you wake up in your place.

1512
01:32:38,690 --> 01:32:40,110
Not — you don't have to do it all the time.

1513
01:32:40,310 --> 01:32:40,690
Yeah, yeah.

1514
01:32:40,710 --> 01:32:41,770
Sometimes you wake up — your background.

1515
01:32:41,910 --> 01:32:43,710
It's called background and it's called quick rise.

1516
01:32:43,850 --> 01:32:45,970
Quick rise is where you wake up and your place.

1517
01:32:46,330 --> 01:32:46,650
Uh-huh.

1518
01:32:46,910 --> 01:32:48,170
And backroll is obviously your back rolling.

1519
01:32:48,790 --> 01:32:49,090
Okay.

1520
01:32:49,330 --> 01:32:52,210
So you backroll to gain some space from your opponent.

1521
01:32:52,530 --> 01:32:53,210
Uh-huh.

1522
01:32:55,590 --> 01:32:58,470
Yes, so you just need to know how to do it properly.

1523
01:32:59,130 --> 01:32:59,670
Yeah, yeah.

1524
01:32:59,910 --> 01:33:01,270
Like can you do it intentionally?

1525
01:33:04,270 --> 01:33:34,470
is that okay yeah yeah so this is good to gain some space so you don't always stay in front of your opponent okay i i get it yeah you learn something now yeah yeah yeah now i need you to apply it in a match okay when you get knocked down by someone like if someone throws you i need you to backroll so you don't stay in his face uh-huh keep dying basically i got this I got it.

1526
01:33:34,950 --> 01:33:34,970
All right.

1527
01:33:34,990 --> 01:33:36,730
I figured it out.

1528
01:33:37,090 --> 01:33:37,550
All right.

1529
01:33:37,930 --> 01:33:38,470
Another new thing.

1530
01:33:38,970 --> 01:33:40,650
Now you can start.

1531
01:33:41,670 --> 01:33:41,810
All right.

1532
01:33:41,930 --> 01:33:42,230
I'm ready.

1533
01:33:44,690 --> 01:33:46,770
And then one day I'll be able to do this.

1534
01:33:47,350 --> 01:33:47,630
Oh yeah.

1535
01:33:48,130 --> 01:33:49,550
Wait, pause the matchmaking a bit.

1536
01:33:49,750 --> 01:33:50,090
Pause the matchmaking.

1537
01:33:50,790 --> 01:33:52,630
I need to.

1538
01:33:55,050 --> 01:33:57,230
I'm going to need you to look at my screen for a bit.

1539
01:33:57,410 --> 01:33:57,670
All right.

1540
01:33:59,410 --> 01:34:03,270
So sometimes I see you, this is going to be a bit difficult to learn, but.

1541
01:34:04,290 --> 01:34:05,610
Uh, this is going to be useful.

1542
01:34:05,930 --> 01:34:08,470
So I see you walking back to do the headbutts.

1543
01:34:10,310 --> 01:34:12,930
But when you walk back a lot, you lose a lot of space.

1544
01:34:13,650 --> 01:34:16,890
And then you lose, you lose the range on the headbutt because it doesn't go full screen.

1545
01:34:17,630 --> 01:34:18,010
Uh-huh.

1546
01:34:18,110 --> 01:34:19,450
Unless you do the heavy budget.

1547
01:34:20,050 --> 01:34:21,790
Don't want to go full screen.

1548
01:34:22,970 --> 01:34:26,590
But you can actually hold down back to charge.

1549
01:34:27,830 --> 01:34:31,390
And then as soon as you want to do the headbutt, you just, you just go, Oh!

1550
01:34:31,630 --> 01:34:32,730
You just stand and do it.

1551
01:34:33,570 --> 01:34:34,930
Oh, I can...

1552
01:34:34,930 --> 01:34:36,590
Oh, okay, so I can just stay still.

1553
01:34:38,050 --> 01:34:38,770
No, yes.

1554
01:34:38,910 --> 01:34:40,410
As soon as you want to do the head, you just stand.

1555
01:34:40,790 --> 01:34:42,210
Yeah, you just let go down and do it.

1556
01:34:43,210 --> 01:34:50,690
That way you don't lose a lot of space because you're walking by yourself back and you end up in the corner and then you panic and then you die and then you get sad.

1557
01:34:51,170 --> 01:34:51,310
Okay.

1558
01:34:52,110 --> 01:34:53,590
We both get sad.

1559
01:34:54,530 --> 01:34:54,890
Basically.

1560
01:34:57,730 --> 01:35:00,030
Yeah, so I'm going to need you to apply that in a match.

1561
01:35:00,190 --> 01:35:00,430
All right.

1562
01:35:00,770 --> 01:35:01,470

1572
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:27,280
You don't expect that!

1573
01:36:30,780 --> 01:36:31,760
That's right!

1574
01:36:32,860 --> 01:36:36,320
Oh, you don't expect that!

1575
01:36:36,540 --> 01:36:37,020
The leg!

1576
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:39,860
Don't forget the stop sign.

1577
01:36:40,220 --> 01:36:40,720
Oh, yeah, you're right.

1578
01:36:41,020 --> 01:36:41,980
Oh, my God.

1579
01:36:42,160 --> 01:36:43,260
I'm forgetting the stop sign.

1580
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:44,900
Nice.

1581
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:46,900
I don't stop that.

1582
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:48,720
That's right.

1583
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:50,900
That was a good combo.

1584
01:36:52,380 --> 01:36:53,260
Yeah, it's one button.

1585
01:36:57,700 --> 01:36:59,200
It's my auto button.

1586
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:03,740
That's fine.

1587
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:04,420
We count that.

1588
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:06,460
Oh.

1589
01:37:07,420 --> 01:37:08,220

Okay, I didn't expect that, but I'll take those.

1592
01:37:47,730 --> 01:37:48,150
There we go.

1593
01:37:48,830 --> 01:37:49,630
We don't question things.

1594
01:37:49,810 --> 01:37:51,030
If they work, we don't question them.

1595
01:37:51,310 --> 01:37:52,190
That's right!

1596
01:37:53,150 --> 01:37:55,010
Get out of here!

1597
01:37:56,510 --> 01:37:57,050
Uh-oh.

01:37:57,930 --> 01:37:58,690

1599
01:37:58,990 --> 01:38:00,250
Oh, don't watch this.

01:38:00,690 --> 01:38:01,190
Oh, watching!

1602
01:38:01,890 --> 01:38:02,750
Are you watching?

1603
01:38:02,850 --> 01:38:03,190
I'm watching.

1604
01:38:03,690 --> 01:38:04,810
I'm not watching anymore.

1605
01:38:05,090 --> 01:38:05,890
Oh, shit, stop watching!

1606
01:38:06,010 --> 01:38:06,450
Stop watching!

1607
01:38:06,750 --> 01:38:07,030
Stop watching!

1608
01:38:07,030 --> 01:38:07,230

1612
01:38:14,610 --> 01:38:14,770
No!

1613
01:38:15,970 --> 01:38:17,030
Okay, that's good.

1614
01:38:20,610 --> 01:38:21,570
All right.

1615
01:38:21,830 --> 01:38:21,950
All right.

1616
01:38:22,170 --> 01:38:23,930
This is one thing I need you to know also.

1617
01:38:24,450 --> 01:38:24,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1618
01:38:24,850 --> 01:38:26,090
Pause matchmaking, pause matchmaking.

1619
01:38:26,590 --> 01:38:26,650
Okay.

1620
01:38:27,190 --> 01:38:27,610
Okay.

1621
01:38:28,190 --> 01:38:28,670
No!

1622
01:38:28,850 --> 01:38:29,910

1623
01:38:30,090 --> 01:38:31,030
Okay, I have to after this.

1624
01:38:31,310 --> 01:38:31,430
After this.

1625
01:38:31,590 --> 01:38:32,070
Okay.

1626
01:38:32,490 --> 01:38:34,050
There's something you need to know about burnout.

1627
01:38:34,410 --> 01:38:38,590
Burnout is when someone is burnt out, that's when you need to go ham on someone.

1628
01:38:38,690 --> 01:38:38,970
Okay.

1629
01:38:38,970 --> 01:38:40,950
And I'll show you how exactly.

1630
01:38:45,890 --> 01:38:46,790
No, no, no, no, no.

1631
01:38:46,950 --> 01:38:48,390
Oh, my God, I pressed the wrong button.

1632
01:38:49,750 --> 01:38:50,430
It's okay, it's okay.

1633
01:38:50,570 --> 01:38:50,870
It's okay.

1634
01:38:51,470 --> 01:38:51,590
Yeah.

1635
01:38:52,750 --> 01:38:53,210
You're fine.

1636
01:38:53,350 --> 01:38:53,770
You see that?

1637
01:38:53,890 --> 01:38:54,670
I stood still.

1638
01:38:55,410 --> 01:38:56,110
Oh, you see that?

1639
01:38:56,170 --> 01:38:57,590
He thinks I used a different move.

1640
01:38:58,110 --> 01:38:59,430
He thinks I'm going, oh, no.

1641
01:39:00,030 --> 01:39:00,930
It's a different fight.

1642
01:39:04,070 --> 01:39:04,390
Stop.

1643
01:39:05,570 --> 01:39:05,890
Stop.

1644
01:39:06,550 --> 01:39:07,150
Oh, my God.

1645
01:39:07,150 --> 01:39:07,630
Oh, my God.

1646
01:39:07,750 --> 01:39:07,830
Wait.

1647
01:39:08,150 --> 01:39:08,590
Oh, my God.

1648
01:39:08,670 --> 01:39:08,830
Wait.

1649
01:39:08,970 --> 01:39:09,410
Wait a minute.

1650
01:39:09,750 --> 01:39:10,350
He's stopping me.

1651
01:39:10,410 --> 01:39:11,090
There was a bomb in you.

1652
01:39:11,330 --> 01:39:12,530
Yeah, he's stopping me.

1653
01:39:14,930 --> 01:39:15,590
He has better ping.

1654
01:39:15,730 --> 01:39:16,270
He has better ping.

1655
01:39:16,790 --> 01:39:17,910
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1656
01:39:18,170 --> 01:39:19,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1657
01:39:19,330 --> 01:39:20,430
There you go.

1658
01:39:22,030 --> 01:39:22,230
Oh.

1659
01:39:23,710 --> 01:39:24,190
No!

1660
01:39:28,250 --> 01:39:28,730
No!

1661
01:39:28,890 --> 01:39:30,150
No, I couldn't get out!

1662
01:39:31,770 --> 01:39:33,690
That's when you need to use your level one super.

1663
01:39:34,630 --> 01:39:35,110
Okay.

1664
01:39:35,830 --> 01:39:37,210
That's the only way out.

1665
01:39:38,250 --> 01:39:38,730
Okay.

1666
01:39:39,710 --> 01:39:40,010
Okay.

1667
01:39:40,670 --> 01:39:41,150
Oh.

1668
01:39:41,590 --> 01:39:41,750
Oops.

1669
01:39:43,410 --> 01:39:44,630
Oh, come on.

1670
01:39:45,410 --> 01:39:46,730
Come on, John.

1671
01:39:47,410 --> 01:39:48,810
Let me have this.

1672

I was gonna tell you, he's gonna spamming drive impact.

1674
01:39:54,230 --> 01:39:55,970
So I'm gonna need you to wait for it and react.

1675
01:39:59,810 --> 01:40:00,250
Oh.

1676
01:40:02,350 --> 01:40:03,190
See, I told you.

1677
01:40:04,010 --> 01:40:04,390
No.

1678
01:40:06,050 --> 01:40:08,130
Oh, no, he locked it too.

He's gonna do drive impact.

1682
01:40:12,810 --> 01:40:13,990
I'm gonna need you to level one super it.

1683
01:40:14,650 --> 01:40:14,950
Okay.

1684
01:40:16,530 --> 01:40:17,130

01:41:25,930 --> 01:41:26,550
He's gonna do it.

Do not do the combo.

1707
01:41:32,890 --> 01:41:33,710
I messed it up.

1708
01:41:33,950 --> 01:41:34,690
I messed it up.

1709
01:41:39,330 --> 01:41:41,630
Wait, no, no, he jumped.

1710
01:41:43,690 --> 01:41:44,560
He jumped over it.

1711
01:41:45,670 --> 01:41:46,850
Fucking, oh.

1712
01:41:53,800 --> 01:41:54,300

No, you can't.

1717
01:41:58,600 --> 01:41:59,400
You don't have enough health.

1718
01:41:59,820 --> 01:42:00,480
You don't have enough health.

1719
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:01,880
I almost got it.

1720
01:42:06,600 --> 01:42:09,560
Guys, I'm not on the Capcom channel today.

1721
01:42:09,940 --> 01:42:10,980
This is a freebie.

1722
01:42:11,460 --> 01:42:13,320
Tomorrow I have to make sure I don't swear.

1723
01:42:15,480 --> 01:42:39,520
all right uh pause matchmaking for a bit okay oh yeah forever that oh my god it's taking forever i bet like it almost found me a game all right all right so uh look at my screen yeah so wait so when someone is burned out yeah so usually when you do a headbutts Your turn is over,

1724
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:39,760
right?

1725
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:45,880
But if they're burned out, your turn is not over, actually.

1726
01:42:46,180 --> 01:42:46,420
Okay.

1727
01:42:46,740 --> 01:42:48,220
So you can do headbutts.

1728
01:42:50,660 --> 01:42:52,620
You can do headbutts and then press jab.

1729
01:42:52,820 --> 01:42:55,240
And then median, I mean, the stop sign.

1730
01:42:56,560 --> 01:42:57,700
You can just bully them with this.

1731
01:42:57,820 --> 01:42:58,880
You can just bully them with this.

1732
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:03,800
But technically, this is something that a lot of high-level players want to do.

1733
01:43:03,980 --> 01:43:05,780
Like top player, they do this into butt slam.

1734
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:38,660
oh that's a little too much yeah yeah it's a bit too much but uh i mean you get my point basically yeah when someone is burnt out yeah whatever isn't your turn becomes sort of your turn in most cases okay so this becomes much much in your turn so i have to keep doing that yeah oh this as well this one as well okay you can go this this okay all right just do that more yeah and even this Even this.

1735
01:43:39,340 --> 01:43:39,740
Okay.

1736
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:40,420
Oh, this is zero.

1737
01:43:40,660 --> 01:43:40,780
Never mind.

1738
01:43:40,900 --> 01:43:41,560
No, it's not your turn.

1739
01:43:41,640 --> 01:43:41,980
It's neutral.

1740
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:43,160
Oh, okay.

1741
01:43:43,260 --> 01:43:44,800
So just do...

1742
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:46,480
Down and...

1743
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:47,600
And headbutt.

1744
01:43:47,900 --> 01:43:48,960
And headbutt.

1745
01:43:49,900 --> 01:43:51,200
Yeah, headbutt becomes really good.

1746
01:43:51,400 --> 01:43:52,880
But you need to press jab afterwards.

1747
01:43:53,320 --> 01:43:53,500
Okay.

1748
01:43:53,700 --> 01:43:56,120
So when you do headbutt, press your jab button.

1749
01:43:57,680 --> 01:43:58,380
Or this.

1750
01:43:59,160 --> 01:44:00,980
Okay, and then...

1751
01:44:00,980 --> 01:44:01,220
Okay.

1752
01:44:03,480 --> 01:44:04,900
But when they burned out.

1753
01:44:05,060 --> 01:44:05,880
When they're burned out.

1754
01:44:06,080 --> 01:44:06,120
Okay.

1755
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:07,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1756
01:44:08,040 --> 01:44:12,760
If someone's burnt out, basically you gain extra frames of advantage.

1757
01:44:12,980 --> 01:44:15,440
So you have your more advantages when someone's burned out.

1758
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:17,080
Okay.

1759
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:18,240
Got it.

1760
01:44:19,180 --> 01:44:19,420
Okay.

1761
01:44:19,780 --> 01:44:20,720
So you get to...

1762
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:21,880
And that applies to you as well.

1763
01:44:21,980 --> 01:44:25,240
If you're burnt out, then that means you have to hold in more stuff.

1764
01:44:25,460 --> 01:44:28,380
So basically, you're expected to block more when you're burnt out.

1765
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:30,840
Oh, no.

1766
01:44:30,920 --> 01:44:33,680
So bringing burnt out is the worst time to panic.

1767
01:44:34,120 --> 01:44:34,480
Yeah.

1768
01:44:35,160 --> 01:44:35,640
Yeah.

1769
01:44:35,780 --> 01:44:36,780
But it's okay.

1770
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:37,920
I panic all the time.

1771
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:41,040
That doesn't make a difference, really.

1772
01:44:45,120 --> 01:44:45,380
All right.

1773
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:49,600
That's right.

1774
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,260
Oh, that's right.

1775
01:44:51,460 --> 01:44:52,160
Not expecting that.

1776
01:44:52,300 --> 01:44:52,740
Are you?

1777
01:44:53,640 --> 01:44:55,060
Now get over here.

1778
01:44:57,780 --> 01:44:58,640
That's right.

1779
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:00,540
That was nice.

1780
01:45:00,740 --> 01:45:01,080
That was nice.

1781
01:45:01,580 --> 01:45:01,720
Okay.

1782
01:45:02,100 --> 01:45:02,300
All right.

1783
01:45:02,380 --> 01:45:03,820
We need to chill for a bit.

1784
01:45:04,520 --> 01:45:05,380
Don't get to have a compass.

1785
01:45:05,900 --> 01:45:06,480
Oh, no.

1786
01:45:06,700 --> 01:45:07,260
Oh, no.

1787
01:45:08,040 --> 01:45:08,840
I did chill.

1788
01:45:09,640 --> 01:45:10,160
I...

1789
01:45:10,160 --> 01:45:11,820
I wasn't chill, really.

1790
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:12,920
I...

1791
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:14,520
I did chill.

1792
01:45:19,080 --> 01:45:19,600
I...

1793
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:20,260
Oh no.

1794
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:20,700
All right.

1795
01:45:21,280 --> 01:45:21,400
Oh no.

1796
01:45:21,400 --> 01:45:24,340
I'm needing to react with the level one or level two.

1797
01:45:24,500 --> 01:45:25,320
The diesel drive impact.

1798
01:45:25,880 --> 01:45:26,040
Okay.

1799
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:27,480
Watch.

1800
01:45:27,780 --> 01:45:27,880

Because I want to grab you.

1813
01:46:57,320 --> 01:47:00,320

Okay.

1822
01:47:28,460 --> 01:47:28,900

1823
01:47:29,120 --> 01:47:29,540
No!

1824
01:47:30,740 --> 01:47:30,960
No!

1825
01:47:31,400 --> 01:47:32,660
This is a Jelpy Aki.

1826
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:33,340
Yeah.

1827
01:47:36,980 --> 01:47:37,840
Nice.

1828
01:47:39,980 --> 01:47:40,860
Stop!

1829
01:47:41,200 --> 01:47:41,580
Stop!

1830
01:47:42,180 --> 01:47:43,060
Stop!

1831
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:44,080
Here you go.

1832
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:47,280
What?

1833
01:47:49,900 --> 01:47:50,300
Again?

1834
01:47:51,220 --> 01:47:51,400
Yeah.

1835
01:47:52,280 --> 01:47:53,360
That's because you're walking forward.

1836
01:47:53,580 --> 01:47:55,880
That's why you get that.

1837
01:47:59,120 --> 01:47:59,520
There you go.

1838
01:47:59,660 --> 01:47:59,940
Nice.

1839
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:01,340
Chill back a bit.

1840
01:48:01,620 --> 01:48:02,360
Get your meter back.

1841
01:48:05,700 --> 01:48:06,300
There you go.

1842
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:06,720
Nice.

1843
01:48:06,920 --> 01:48:07,880
Get your meter back.

1844
01:48:08,620 --> 01:48:08,840
I'm out.

1845
01:48:08,900 --> 01:48:09,740
You know you want to jump over?

1846
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:10,420
Oh, shit.

1847
01:48:10,600 --> 01:48:10,920
Never mind.

1848
01:48:12,320 --> 01:48:12,660
Oh.

1849
01:48:13,580 --> 01:48:13,980
Oh.

1850
01:48:13,980 --> 01:48:14,100
Oh.

1851
01:48:14,100 --> 01:48:15,980
You don't remember... Oh, I'm sorry.

1852
01:48:16,140 --> 01:48:17,460
I didn't get my meter back.

1853
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:27,240
Nice.

1854
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:32,260
He's going to jump again.

1855
01:48:32,460 --> 01:48:32,960
Oh, okay.

1856
01:48:33,220 --> 01:48:33,380
Nice.

1857
01:48:33,420 --> 01:48:33,780
There you go.

1858
01:48:33,960 --> 01:48:34,440
Never mind.

1859
01:48:34,620 --> 01:48:35,060
You didn't jump.

1860
01:48:35,100 --> 01:48:36,080
Yeah, you didn't jump.

1861
01:48:36,680 --> 01:48:37,980
You made your mistake.

1862
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:39,920
Watch this.

1863
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:42,960
She never...

1864
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:45,180
She lets me do it all the time.

1865
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:50,200
Nice.

1866
01:48:50,200 --> 01:48:50,740
Oh, shit.

1867
01:48:51,580 --> 01:48:52,740
Oh, I'm sorry.

1868
01:48:53,940 --> 01:48:54,580
Stop.

1869
01:48:58,160 --> 01:48:58,500
Nice.

1870
01:48:58,800 --> 01:48:58,980
Okay.

1871
01:48:59,820 --> 01:49:00,760
You're getting the hang of it.

1872
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:01,460
Oh, no.

1873
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:02,960
She's been.

1874
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:05,380
She's been, she's watching the stream.

1875
01:49:11,900 --> 01:49:11,920
Help.

1876
01:49:12,580 --> 01:49:12,760
Help me.

1877
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:15,320
Help me coach.

1878
01:49:15,320 --> 01:49:15,340
Help me coach.

1879
01:49:15,340 --> 01:49:15,660
Oh, look, I'm super.

1880
01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:16,300
Oh, B.

1881
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:18,560
I think it was over.

1882
01:49:19,060 --> 01:49:20,620
He's completely defenseless.

1883
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:25,680
The crotch, why did you help me?

1884
01:49:25,880 --> 01:49:26,780
I'm trying!

1885
01:49:32,100 --> 01:49:36,500
I need to use also, I need to also use the back roll on Waco.

1886
01:49:38,060 --> 01:49:39,280
He just watched!

1887
01:49:42,900 --> 01:49:44,800
Sometimes you gotta learn the hard way, you know.

1888
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:46,620
What did I learn?

1889
01:49:46,760 --> 01:49:47,840
I didn't learn anything!

1890
01:49:50,840 --> 01:49:52,980
Bro, you didn't teach me anything!

1891
01:49:53,820 --> 01:49:54,380
Bro,

1892
01:49:58,600 --> 01:49:59,700
is this the same guy?

1893
01:50:00,020 --> 01:50:02,040
Is this the guy that...

1894
01:50:02,040 --> 01:50:03,300
Bro, okay, get out!

1895
01:50:04,660 --> 01:50:04,960
Okay.

1896
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:07,100
He's gonna jump, he's gonna jump.

1897
01:50:07,400 --> 01:50:07,600
Okay.

1898
01:50:08,480 --> 01:50:08,580
Nice.

1899
01:50:11,120 --> 01:50:12,680
Get out of here.

1900
01:50:17,460 --> 01:50:18,660
There we go.

1901
01:50:22,820 --> 01:50:24,500
Oh, no, it's too soon.

1902
01:50:27,820 --> 01:50:28,500
Oh, no.

1903
01:50:28,840 --> 01:50:30,860
Oh, my God, he's fucking...

1904
01:50:30,860 --> 01:50:32,020
Oh, no, that's right.

1905
01:50:34,080 --> 01:50:34,500
All right.

1906
01:50:35,160 --> 01:50:36,760
You just need to press literally one...

1907
01:50:36,760 --> 01:50:37,160
Okay, yeah.

1908
01:50:38,420 --> 01:50:39,140
All right, here we go.

1909
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:40,960
Is this the shoe guy?

1910
01:50:41,060 --> 01:50:42,520
It's the shoe guy, isn't it?

1911
01:50:42,640 --> 01:50:43,220
It is, yeah.

1912
01:50:43,460 --> 01:50:45,040
Oh, my God, it's him.

1913
01:50:46,200 --> 01:50:46,860
He and I...

1914
01:50:46,860 --> 01:50:49,380
No, I think that guy, no, I think that guy was named John.

1915
01:50:49,640 --> 01:50:50,920
Oh, yeah, his name was John.

1916
01:50:50,980 --> 01:50:51,200
Yeah.

1917
01:50:51,440 --> 01:50:52,740
Are they all like this?

1918
01:50:52,820 --> 01:50:55,040
Like, is this...

1919
01:50:55,040 --> 01:50:55,980
Is this...

1920
01:50:55,980 --> 01:50:56,500
Is this...

1921
01:50:56,500 --> 01:50:57,260
Is this all...

1922
01:50:57,260 --> 01:50:58,960
How they play all the time?

1923
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:00,320
Basically.

1924
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:02,160
Oh my god!

1925
01:51:02,460 --> 01:51:02,960
Get alive!

1926
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:08,640
That's right, I'll kill your shoe!

1927
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:11,620
Okay, there you go.

1928
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:14,320
Yeah, he's just jumping over you.

1929
01:51:14,880 --> 01:51:15,900
Oh my god, okay.

1930
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:16,980
That's fine.

1931
01:51:18,620 --> 01:51:18,920
Okay.

1932
01:51:19,260 --> 01:51:20,680
Use your other anti-air as well.

1933
01:51:21,120 --> 01:51:21,580
Haven't it?

1934
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:22,000
Oh yeah.

1935
01:51:24,040 --> 01:51:53,720
um it's not early too early um too early too late not too late you're passing it too early or too late when is it the right time nice i don't like this guy okay nice oh my god the press is after it.

1936
01:51:58,270 --> 01:52:00,410
Oh, but God, he just grabs me.

1937
01:52:02,710 --> 01:52:03,970
Oh, my God.

1938
01:52:05,110 --> 01:52:05,510
Coach.

1939
01:52:07,350 --> 01:52:09,210
I need to stop panicking for a bit.

1940
01:52:09,730 --> 01:52:09,850
Okay.

1941
01:52:10,190 --> 01:52:10,370
Okay.

1942
01:52:10,370 --> 01:52:10,870
What do I do?

1943
01:52:11,230 --> 01:52:11,890
What do I do?

1944
01:52:12,610 --> 01:52:13,590
Now wait for him to jump.

1945
01:52:13,690 --> 01:52:14,130
He's going to jump.

1946
01:52:16,050 --> 01:52:18,430
What you didn't tell me what to do afterwards.

1947
01:52:19,370 --> 01:52:20,770
When he jumps, you aren't tired.

1948
01:52:22,530 --> 01:52:23,290
What do you mean?

1949
01:52:23,330 --> 01:52:23,910
I didn't tell you.

1950
01:52:23,930 --> 01:52:24,890
I told you a million times.

1951
01:52:25,910 --> 01:52:29,630
Yes, but you had to keep telling me that I'll never learn.

1952
01:52:30,210 --> 01:52:30,690
Oh, I did it!

1953
01:52:30,830 --> 01:52:32,050
I did it!

1954
01:52:32,350 --> 01:52:33,010
I did it!

1955
01:52:33,010 --> 01:52:33,470
I did it!

1956
01:52:33,710 --> 01:52:36,050
I... Oh, my...

1957
01:52:36,050 --> 01:52:37,470
No, he didn't block a second hit!

1958
01:52:37,570 --> 01:52:37,890
No!

1959
01:52:39,130 --> 01:52:40,730
It's okay, it's very winnable.

1960
01:52:41,110 --> 01:52:42,250
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1961
01:52:43,970 --> 01:52:45,950
You just need to hold your place and just anti-air.

1962
01:52:46,210 --> 01:52:46,490
Okay.

1963
01:52:49,090 --> 01:52:49,790
There we go.

1964
01:52:50,250 --> 01:52:50,550
Yes.

1965
01:52:51,310 --> 01:52:52,970
Wait, he doesn't jumping anywhere.

1966
01:52:53,530 --> 01:52:54,090
You realize?

1967
01:52:55,050 --> 01:52:56,770
I need to protect your ankle as well.

1968
01:52:58,210 --> 01:52:59,950
Oh my god.

1969
01:53:00,090 --> 01:53:00,390
There you go.

1970
01:53:00,710 --> 01:53:02,110
Okay, that's good.

1971
01:53:04,740 --> 01:53:08,460
I need to press jab after after you block the headbutt.

1972
01:53:08,660 --> 01:53:09,760
After you block the headbutt, I need to press.

1973
01:53:09,940 --> 01:53:10,120
Okay.

1974
01:53:12,340 --> 01:53:13,140
There you go.

1975
01:53:13,340 --> 01:53:13,640
Stop!

1976
01:53:17,200 --> 01:53:18,580
Oh my god.

1977
01:53:18,900 --> 01:53:19,280
Stop.

1978
01:53:27,220 --> 01:53:29,620
He's just taking advantage of you panicking.

1979
01:53:30,760 --> 01:53:31,840
I wasn't.

1980
01:53:33,020 --> 01:53:34,280
Okay, okay, okay.

1981
01:53:36,620 --> 01:53:36,860
Okay.

1982
01:53:37,140 --> 01:53:37,280
Okay.

1983
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:38,560
That's fine.

1984
01:53:38,780 --> 01:53:39,060
That's fine.

1985
01:53:39,160 --> 01:53:40,080
We stopped him.

1986
01:53:40,340 --> 01:53:42,540
We stopped him at least.

1987
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:46,440
Why the...

1988
01:53:46,440 --> 01:53:48,120
Why are you looking good at you like that?

1989
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:48,820
I don't know!

1990
01:53:49,100 --> 01:53:50,060
I don't know!

1991
01:53:50,260 --> 01:53:50,980
I'm joking!

1992
01:53:51,340 --> 01:53:52,680
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1993
01:53:52,700 --> 01:53:53,080
Okay, okay.

1994
01:53:53,540 --> 01:53:54,040
Stop.

1995
01:53:54,980 --> 01:53:56,000
Try that again.

1996
01:53:57,400 --> 01:53:57,880
Headbutts.

1997
01:53:57,960 --> 01:53:58,060
Oh.

1998
01:53:58,620 --> 01:53:59,100
Okay.

1999
01:53:59,240 --> 01:53:59,820
This works too.

2000
01:53:59,960 --> 01:54:01,260
This works too.

2001
01:54:02,620 --> 01:54:03,460
There you go.

2002
01:54:03,560 --> 01:54:03,860
Nice.

2003
01:54:04,200 --> 01:54:04,360
Yes.

2004
01:54:07,870 --> 01:54:08,630
There you go.

2005
01:54:08,870 --> 01:54:09,310
Okay.

2006
01:54:09,370 --> 01:54:09,610
Okay.

2007
01:54:10,770 --> 01:54:10,890
Okay.

2008
01:54:11,450 --> 01:54:11,550
Oh.

2009
01:54:13,030 --> 01:54:13,510
Oh.

2010
01:54:15,410 --> 01:54:15,890
No!

2011
01:54:16,650 --> 01:54:17,130
No!

2012
01:54:17,850 --> 01:54:18,450
It's okay.

2013
01:54:18,530 --> 01:54:18,730
It's okay.

2014
01:54:18,850 --> 01:54:19,050
Say it.

2015
01:54:19,110 --> 01:54:19,350
Say it.

2016
01:54:19,710 --> 01:54:20,250
You're fine.

2017
01:54:20,370 --> 01:54:20,570
You're fine.

2018
01:54:21,150 --> 01:54:21,630
No!

2019
01:54:21,990 --> 01:54:22,170
What?

2020
01:54:22,490 --> 01:54:23,310
I'm not fine.

2021
01:54:23,430 --> 01:54:24,310
Stop saying that.

2022
01:54:24,550 --> 01:54:24,810
Stop.

2023
01:54:29,110 --> 01:54:29,970
Okay, okay.

2024
01:54:30,350 --> 01:54:32,430
Let's retrace it how you lost.

2025
01:54:32,830 --> 01:54:35,690
He jumped three times and you failed to enter.

2026
01:54:36,670 --> 01:54:37,470
What do you mean?

2027
01:54:37,550 --> 01:54:38,470
I did this.

2028
01:54:38,850 --> 01:54:39,270
I didn't.

2029
01:54:40,690 --> 01:54:42,330
You were doing it too late.

2030
01:54:43,290 --> 01:54:49,410
In that scenario, in that scenario, if someone is not close to you and he jumps, you just do headbutts.

2031
01:54:50,290 --> 01:54:55,510
If someone is close to you and he tries to jump to the other side, that's when you use your other anti-air.

2032
01:54:55,570 --> 01:54:55,930
Okay.

2033
01:54:56,310 --> 01:54:56,830

01:56:11,920 --> 01:56:12,200
Okay.

2041
01:56:13,020 --> 01:56:13,600
Oh my god.

2042
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:15,900
I need you to know I was blocking.

2043
01:56:16,640 --> 01:56:17,640
You're blocking there.

2044
01:56:17,800 --> 01:56:19,760
You're blocking glow while he's jumping.

2045
01:56:19,940 --> 01:56:20,720
You need to block up.

2046
01:56:20,760 --> 01:56:23,620
Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay.

2047
01:56:24,180 --> 01:56:26,260
Okay, that was my bad.

2048
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:28,640
Oh my god.

2049
01:56:29,260 --> 01:56:30,760
Are you playing in modern as well?

2050
01:56:31,240 --> 01:56:32,360

2054
01:57:10,720 --> 01:57:11,420
It's okay.

2055
01:57:12,900 --> 01:57:13,940
There you go.

2056
01:57:16,060 --> 01:57:16,060
Oh!

01:57:16,320 --> 01:57:17,220
I thought faster!

2058
01:57:20,040 --> 01:57:22,680
Okay, I gotta make sure I don't...

2059
01:57:22,680 --> 01:57:24,180
Don't use any special.

2060
01:57:27,910 --> 01:57:28,430
Oh!

2061
01:57:29,730 --> 01:57:30,590

2062
01:57:30,790 --> 01:57:31,410
It's fine.

2063
01:57:31,570 --> 01:57:31,910
That's fine.

2064
01:57:34,130 --> 01:57:34,650
Oh!

2065
01:57:34,910 --> 01:57:35,370
Oh!

2066
01:57:36,350 --> 01:57:38,110
Oh, I was trying to grab.

2067
01:57:38,370 --> 01:57:41,670
Yeah, no, I was trying to do a butt stab, but it didn't work.

2068
01:57:42,110 --> 01:57:42,910
All right, I need to block.

2069
01:57:44,270 --> 01:57:44,510
Back roll.

2070
01:57:45,490 --> 01:57:46,570
Don't forget the back roll.

2071
01:57:49,090 --> 01:57:50,010
Oh, there you go.

2072
01:57:50,090 --> 01:57:50,630
There you go.

2073
01:57:50,790 --> 01:57:50,930

You're panicking on these are too much.

01:57:58,650 --> 01:57:59,170
You need to learn.

2077
01:57:59,310 --> 01:57:59,930
You need to block.

2078
01:58:00,090 --> 01:58:00,870
You need to remember to watch.

2079
01:58:02,390 --> 01:58:03,210

2080
01:58:09,790 --> 01:58:10,330
Oh, shit.

2081
01:58:11,010 --> 01:58:12,230
It's not your time afterwards.

2082
01:58:13,150 --> 01:58:13,750
Nice.

2083
01:58:14,990 --> 01:58:15,050
No!

2084
01:58:18,370 --> 01:58:18,770

You're far, you're far.

2104
01:59:32,860 --> 01:59:33,180
Don't panic.

2105
01:59:34,260 --> 01:59:34,620
Stop!

2106
01:59:35,720 --> 01:59:36,160

The other button.

2110
01:59:39,880 --> 01:59:40,600
The other button?

2111
01:59:42,200 --> 01:59:43,540
You have two anti-airs.

2112
01:59:43,600 --> 01:59:44,780
You have the head button and the other button.

2113
01:59:45,300 --> 01:59:45,520
Okay.

2114
01:59:48,040 --> 01:59:49,680
But when they jump from far, just use headbutt.

2115
01:59:50,600 --> 01:59:51,000
Okay.

2116
01:59:51,440 --> 01:59:51,780
Yes.

2117
01:59:52,220 --> 01:59:53,760

01:59:53,940 --> 01:59:54,680
Coach, did you see that?

Yes, I saw it.

2120
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:56,380
I saw it.

2121
01:59:56,480 --> 01:59:57,160
Did you see that?

2122
01:59:59,420 --> 01:59:59,680
Nice.

2123
02:00:00,760 --> 02:00:01,020
Yeah!

2124
02:00:01,200 --> 02:00:03,620
So when they jump from further away, use your headbutt.

2125
02:00:03,720 --> 02:00:06,420
If they jump from closer, use your other entire.

2126
02:00:06,780 --> 02:00:07,100
Okay.

2127
02:00:10,910 --> 02:00:12,950
I like this guy.

2128
02:00:15,530 --> 02:00:16,670
That's why you're beating him up.

2129
02:00:17,270 --> 02:00:17,290
Damn!

02:00:17,830 --> 02:00:18,630

2131
02:00:18,630 --> 02:00:24,810

2132
02:00:25,050 --> 02:00:25,530

Nice.

2270
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:12,620
You can win this.

2271
02:07:15,220 --> 02:07:16,040
Oh my god.

2272
02:07:17,140 --> 02:07:18,520
Don't panic, don't panic, don't panic.

2273
02:07:18,860 --> 02:07:19,820

2274
02:07:20,480 --> 02:07:20,540

02:07:23,540 --> 02:07:25,280
She fucking zooms at that?

2278
02:07:26,200 --> 02:07:32,640
I didn't know she's so far away from me.

2279
02:07:32,640 --> 02:07:33,700
I didn't know she played.

2280
02:07:34,200 --> 02:07:34,860
Oh, my God.

2281
02:07:37,860 --> 02:07:42,680
Look, I didn't realize I did block the first one.

2282
02:07:42,920 --> 02:07:44,380
And then I...

2283
02:07:44,380 --> 02:07:44,640
There's two waves.

2284
02:07:45,220 --> 02:07:47,840
I didn't realize she had more than one.

2285
02:07:49,460 --> 02:07:49,940
Nice.

2286
02:07:50,120 --> 02:07:50,440
Okay.

2287
02:07:50,440 --> 02:07:51,240
Now you can still win this.

2288
02:07:51,680 --> 02:07:51,880
You can still win this.

2289
02:07:51,880 --> 02:07:51,900
Okay.

2301
02:08:20,640 --> 02:08:22,420

I thought I could get away with it.

2331
02:12:42,540 --> 02:12:47,080
He's gonna, the only way for him to get damage from there is, was basically job impacting you.

2332
02:12:47,180 --> 02:12:48,480
That's how you lost both rounds.

2333
02:12:49,140 --> 02:12:49,360

Well, uh...

2490
02:21:56,780 --> 02:21:58,360
You can just do this.

2491
02:21:59,020 --> 02:22:32,550
what basically oh yeah because you're getting a lot of jumpers yeah they're not punishing it or you can just do this or easier what what did you do so you were doing this you were doing the heavy punch yeah yeah yeah but you didn't you were not converting into damage so you're just doing this and then walking back so do this and then what what what's after that what did you do It's the medium.

2492
02:22:32,910 --> 02:22:32,930

2493
02:22:33,030 --> 02:22:34,130

No, you're fine, you're learning, you're still learning.

2554
02:24:49,340 --> 02:24:50,940

Oh my god, oh, don't get...

2559
02:25:03,120 --> 02:25:03,700
That's it.

2560
02:25:03,760 --> 02:25:04,520
Protect your ankles.

2561
02:25:07,080 --> 02:25:08,260
Try my best.

2562
02:25:09,060 --> 02:25:09,780

Okay, there we go.

2566
02:25:19,220 --> 02:25:19,800
Don't burn yourself.

2567
02:25:21,600 --> 02:25:23,140
It's muscle memory.

2568
02:25:23,640 --> 02:25:25,340
It's muscle memory.

2569
02:25:31,960 --> 02:25:35,380
I just wanted to give him a little freebie, you know?

2570
02:25:35,580 --> 02:25:36,320

2571
02:25:42,190 --> 02:25:43,190
My ankles!

2572
02:25:43,990 --> 02:25:45,770
Your ankles are not protected.

2573
02:25:46,610 --> 02:25:47,930
My ankles.

2574
02:25:49,570 --> 02:25:50,850

Nice.

2581
02:26:11,800 --> 02:26:12,280

Jump.

2615
02:29:13,920 --> 02:29:14,260
Yeah.

2616
02:29:14,900 --> 02:29:15,380
Stop!

2617
02:29:20,700 --> 02:29:21,580
Oh, no.

2618
02:29:26,710 --> 02:29:27,130
Nice.

2619
02:29:27,870 --> 02:29:29,490
How come I couldn't punish that?

2620
02:29:31,250 --> 02:29:31,710
Oh, thank God.

2621
02:29:32,230 --> 02:29:32,510
Oh, thank God.

2622
02:29:33,090 --> 02:29:33,710
Go for the level three.

2623
02:29:34,210 --> 02:29:34,870
Oh, thank God.

2624
02:29:35,150 --> 02:29:36,490
This is the only way.

2625
02:29:42,680 --> 02:29:44,820
No, if you drive him back to him, you stun him.

2626
02:29:45,380 --> 02:29:45,560
Okay.

2627
02:29:51,210 --> 02:29:51,650
Okay.

2628
02:29:51,850 --> 02:29:52,090
Nice.

2629
02:29:52,230 --> 02:29:52,990
That works too.

2630
02:29:53,130 --> 02:29:53,490
Yeah!

2631
02:29:53,890 --> 02:29:54,590
That works too.

2632
02:29:54,870 --> 02:29:55,410
That works too.

2633
02:30:03,660 --> 02:30:06,840
Oh, I fucked that up, but he doesn't know that.

2634
02:30:07,460 --> 02:30:07,860
My turn!

2635
02:30:09,480 --> 02:30:10,040
That's right!

2636
02:30:12,160 --> 02:30:12,320
Oh.

2637
02:30:15,680 --> 02:30:19,520
I'm EP again, I'm EP again, I'm EP, I'm EP, I'm EP.

2638
02:30:19,680 --> 02:30:20,440
That's fine, that's fine.

2639
02:30:21,160 --> 02:30:23,120
Jump, jump.

2640
02:30:27,550 --> 02:30:27,770
Okay.

2641
02:30:27,910 --> 02:30:29,850
Here we go.

2642
02:30:32,030 --> 02:30:32,550
Nice.

2643
02:30:33,130 --> 02:30:33,530
Nice.

2644
02:30:39,410 --> 02:30:40,210
My turn.

2645
02:30:43,590 --> 02:30:44,750
You're fine, you're fine.

2646
02:30:45,170 --> 02:30:45,870
Am I, I don't feel fine.

2647
02:30:46,410 --> 02:30:46,830
I don't feel fine.

2648
02:30:46,970 --> 02:30:47,050
I don't feel fine.

2649
02:30:47,050 --> 02:30:47,310
I don't feel fine.

2650
02:30:47,410 --> 02:30:47,890
I don't feel fine.

2651
02:30:50,250 --> 02:30:52,290
Oh, VP again.

2652
02:30:52,610 --> 02:30:54,290
A BP, a VP, a VP.

2653
02:30:59,580 --> 02:31:00,960
We can now E VP as well.

2654
02:31:07,060 --> 02:31:07,400
Oh.

2655
02:31:09,460 --> 02:31:09,940
No!

2656
02:31:12,640 --> 02:31:13,040
No!

2657
02:31:13,240 --> 02:31:13,320
No!

2658
02:31:13,840 --> 02:31:13,900
No!

2659
02:31:18,220 --> 02:31:19,740
No, but that was a good try.

2660
02:31:19,860 --> 02:31:20,240
That was a good try.

2661
02:31:20,880 --> 02:31:21,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2662
02:31:22,020 --> 02:31:23,340
See, I've learned.

2663
02:31:24,380 --> 02:31:26,360
So if you drive impact to someone.

2664
02:31:26,920 --> 02:31:27,060
Yeah.

2665
02:31:27,500 --> 02:31:27,880
Okay.

2666
02:31:28,220 --> 02:31:30,200
And it hits, you know, you crumple them.

2667
02:31:30,500 --> 02:31:30,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2668
02:31:30,940 --> 02:31:32,340
Don't use your medium auto combo.

2669
02:31:32,600 --> 02:31:33,780
Use your heavy auto combo.

2670
02:31:34,060 --> 02:31:34,380
Okay.

2671
02:31:34,540 --> 02:31:35,260
For more damage.

2672
02:31:35,580 --> 02:31:37,660
Okay, okay, okay.

2673
02:31:37,660 --> 02:31:38,240
I see you go.

2674
02:31:39,360 --> 02:31:41,500
And what's it called?

2675
02:31:42,680 --> 02:31:48,900
If you, if someone, if you, if you're driving back to someone, you don't have enough meter, just use the command.

2676
02:31:49,020 --> 02:31:50,360
Just use the grab.

2677
02:31:50,820 --> 02:31:51,260
The grab.

2678
02:31:51,520 --> 02:31:51,720
Okay.

2679
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:53,480
Or yeah, just use the grab.

2680
02:31:53,920 --> 02:31:54,100
Okay.

2681
02:31:55,320 --> 02:31:55,560
God.

2682
02:31:55,800 --> 02:31:56,060
Oh my.

2683
02:31:56,080 --> 02:31:57,600
I swear to God.

2684
02:31:58,620 --> 02:31:59,660
Is this the same guy?

2685
02:31:59,820 --> 02:32:00,340
It's ass.

2686
02:32:00,460 --> 02:32:01,520
It's all like, oh my God.

2687
02:32:01,600 --> 02:32:02,240
It's new athlete.

2688
02:32:02,800 --> 02:32:03,680
Oh my God.

2689
02:32:03,940 --> 02:32:04,160
Okay.

2690
02:32:04,260 --> 02:32:04,600
Okay.

2691
02:32:04,840 --> 02:32:05,280
Okay.

2692
02:32:05,280 --> 02:32:06,000
Thank God.

2693
02:32:06,120 --> 02:32:06,900
Thank God.

2694
02:32:07,660 --> 02:32:08,440
than you are.

2695
02:32:13,160 --> 02:32:13,800
Hey,

2696
02:32:17,780 --> 02:32:18,720
get out!

2697
02:32:24,570 --> 02:32:27,070
Oh, get out!

2698
02:32:28,110 --> 02:32:28,530
Oh shit.

2699
02:32:29,870 --> 02:32:31,070
Nice, stop sign, stop sign.

2700
02:32:31,450 --> 02:32:31,770
Stop!

2701
02:32:32,430 --> 02:32:32,710
Stop!

2702
02:32:32,850 --> 02:32:32,890
Oh!

2703
02:32:34,270 --> 02:32:35,270
Stop, stop!

2704
02:32:36,810 --> 02:32:37,450
Stop!

2705
02:32:39,730 --> 02:32:40,370
Nice!

2706
02:32:40,690 --> 02:32:41,230
There we go.

2707
02:32:41,590 --> 02:32:41,690
Hahaha!

2708
02:32:45,210 --> 02:32:47,250
Okay, we figured it out.

2709
02:32:50,110 --> 02:32:50,150
Oh.

2710
02:32:51,470 --> 02:32:52,870
Oh, break your ankles.

2711
02:32:56,030 --> 02:32:57,050
Okay, you're too close to me.

2712
02:32:57,170 --> 02:32:57,850
I don't like that.

2713
02:32:59,350 --> 02:32:59,930
There you go.

2714
02:33:03,870 --> 02:33:04,310
That's right.

2715
02:33:05,390 --> 02:33:06,010
That's right.

2716
02:33:06,230 --> 02:33:06,610
Stop!

2717
02:33:06,910 --> 02:33:07,190
Stop!

2718
02:33:10,090 --> 02:33:12,250
She doesn't know how to deal with the stop.

2719
02:33:13,370 --> 02:33:14,610
No, but she stops me.

2720
02:33:14,650 --> 02:33:15,310
I told you, it's a good button.

2721
02:33:16,830 --> 02:33:17,950
There you go.

2722
02:33:21,930 --> 02:33:22,770
That's right.

2723
02:33:22,970 --> 02:33:23,970
I'll break your ankle.

2724
02:33:27,510 --> 02:33:28,470
Oh, she's scared.

2725
02:33:30,730 --> 02:33:31,670
Yeah, I know you're scared.

2726
02:33:32,690 --> 02:33:32,810
What?

2727
02:33:33,190 --> 02:33:33,390
What?

2728
02:33:33,390 --> 02:33:33,590
EX.

2729
02:33:33,930 --> 02:33:34,490
Easy, actually.

2730
02:33:34,770 --> 02:33:35,390
They jump here.

2731
02:33:36,510 --> 02:33:37,450
Oh, no!

2732
02:33:38,110 --> 02:33:38,670
Oh!

2733
02:33:38,950 --> 02:33:39,570
I'm scared!

2734
02:33:39,750 --> 02:33:40,330
I'm scared!

2735
02:33:40,650 --> 02:33:41,290
I win!

2736
02:33:41,490 --> 02:33:41,630
Okay.

2737
02:33:43,630 --> 02:33:44,730
The one time.

2738
02:33:44,730 --> 02:33:45,730
Tiny King worked.

2739
02:33:52,570 --> 02:33:54,230
We did it.

2740
02:33:55,710 --> 02:33:58,350
Okay, okay, okay.

2741
02:33:58,410 --> 02:33:59,030
Okay, good combo.

2742
02:34:07,680 --> 02:34:08,560
There you go.

2743
02:34:10,580 --> 02:34:10,800
Oh!

2744
02:34:13,720 --> 02:34:14,520
There you go.

2745
02:34:16,760 --> 02:34:18,220
Now I need to chill with EX.

2746
02:34:18,540 --> 02:34:18,820
Okay.

2747
02:34:20,700 --> 02:34:22,240
Or maybe I don't!

2748
02:34:23,440 --> 02:34:25,560
Okay, I mean, that works too.

2749
02:34:26,780 --> 02:34:27,860
That works too, I guess.

2750
02:34:29,640 --> 02:34:31,280
I didn't have to!

2751
02:34:34,220 --> 02:34:34,480
Oh!

2752
02:34:38,870 --> 02:34:40,630
Okay, we both hit each other.

2753
02:34:41,870 --> 02:34:42,270
What?

2754
02:34:43,950 --> 02:34:45,410
I messed up.

2755
02:34:46,370 --> 02:34:46,830
Stop.

2756
02:34:48,590 --> 02:34:51,770
Don't be afraid to keep using the stop button.

2757
02:34:51,790 --> 02:34:53,410
Just use it for a normal.

2758
02:34:53,610 --> 02:34:53,910
It's fine.

2759
02:34:54,550 --> 02:34:54,950
Oh.

2760
02:34:55,630 --> 02:34:56,030
Oh.

2761
02:34:58,230 --> 02:34:59,590
I messed up.

2762
02:35:00,370 --> 02:35:01,790
Because I'm on the wrong side.

2763
02:35:02,530 --> 02:35:03,870
I don't like being on this side.

2764
02:35:06,550 --> 02:35:07,350
All right.

2765
02:35:07,390 --> 02:35:07,690
Go back.

2766
02:35:07,690 --> 02:35:07,910
Get back.

2767
02:35:08,090 --> 02:35:08,170
Get back.

2768
02:35:08,270 --> 02:35:08,430
Get back.

2769
02:35:08,590 --> 02:35:09,130
Oh, thank God.

2770
02:35:09,250 --> 02:35:10,130
She gave me my side back.

2771
02:35:10,910 --> 02:35:11,490
Oh, my God.

2772
02:35:11,570 --> 02:35:12,170
She knows.

2773
02:35:13,070 --> 02:35:15,270
She knows I don't know how to do this side.

2774
02:35:18,010 --> 02:35:19,490
So that's your weak side, though.

2775
02:35:19,490 --> 02:35:19,970
Yeah, yeah.

2776
02:35:20,010 --> 02:35:21,150
That's my weak side.

2777
02:35:25,590 --> 02:35:25,950
Stop!

2778
02:35:29,860 --> 02:35:30,100
Stop!

2779
02:35:30,720 --> 02:35:30,720
Stop!

2780
02:35:31,020 --> 02:35:31,060
Stop!

2781
02:35:31,060 --> 02:35:31,680
Yeah, keep using.

2782
02:35:31,760 --> 02:35:32,200
Yeah, keep using!

2783
02:35:33,400 --> 02:35:34,120
That's right.

2784
02:35:35,340 --> 02:35:35,820
That's right.

2785
02:35:35,920 --> 02:35:36,220
Stop!

2786
02:35:38,040 --> 02:35:39,020
Get on this side!

2787
02:35:39,080 --> 02:35:39,560
Oh, wait, no!

2788
02:35:39,660 --> 02:35:40,860
No, no, no, no, no.

2789
02:35:41,260 --> 02:35:41,280
No!

2790
02:35:42,640 --> 02:35:43,360
No takebacks.

2791
02:35:43,540 --> 02:35:44,120
No takebacks.

2792
02:35:44,640 --> 02:35:45,580
Give me out.

2793
02:35:45,660 --> 02:35:47,700
Oh no, get back on the other side, please.

2794
02:35:51,100 --> 02:35:51,860
Oh my God.

2795
02:35:52,120 --> 02:35:52,560

2825
02:37:08,160 --> 02:37:08,180
Okay.

Oh my god.

2830
02:37:19,020 --> 02:37:19,560

2835
02:37:24,960 --> 02:37:26,680
It's not fine, Coach!

2836
02:37:27,520 --> 02:38:02,800

2837
02:38:03,620 --> 02:38:05,040
It's not working!

2838
02:38:08,680 --> 02:38:10,420
Oh, wait!

2839
02:38:10,960 --> 02:38:11,280
Keep doing it!

2840
02:38:11,340 --> 02:38:12,540
Keep doing it!

2841
02:38:12,960 --> 02:38:15,420
No, you stopped, he hesitated!

2842
02:38:17,500 --> 02:38:17,760
I did!

2843
02:38:17,760 --> 02:38:17,780
No!

2844
02:38:18,060 --> 02:38:18,160
No!

2845
02:38:21,960 --> 02:38:22,440
Okay.

2846
02:38:23,260 --> 02:38:23,740
Okay.

2847
02:38:26,580 --> 02:38:27,060
I...

2848
02:38:27,060 --> 02:38:27,700
I...

2849
02:38:29,080 --> 02:38:30,160
Block, block, block,

2850
02:38:36,220 --> 02:38:36,960
and the drive impacted.

2851
02:38:37,220 --> 02:38:38,060
Oh, no, it's too late now.

2852
02:38:39,240 --> 02:38:42,160
So what he's doing there is you can just drive him back to it.

2853
02:38:42,160 --> 02:38:42,580
Oh, okay.

2854
02:38:42,600 --> 02:38:43,340
Or you accept buttons.

2855
02:38:43,880 --> 02:38:44,060
Okay.

2856
02:38:46,120 --> 02:38:46,380
Okay.

2857
02:38:47,120 --> 02:38:48,700
I'm doing it.

2858
02:38:50,020 --> 02:38:50,420
Oh.

2859
02:38:51,440 --> 02:38:52,620
You're gonna do it again.

2860
02:38:53,180 --> 02:38:53,580
Block.

2861
02:38:53,640 --> 02:38:54,080
You need to block.

2862
02:38:56,920 --> 02:38:57,320
What?

2863
02:39:01,140 --> 02:39:02,540
Oh, my God, he jumps!

2864
02:39:05,200 --> 02:39:05,600
I...

2865
02:39:08,260 --> 02:39:08,880
Oh, no.

2866
02:39:09,240 --> 02:39:09,840
Oh, too far.

2867
02:39:10,120 --> 02:39:15,600
oh my god it's i'm not okay i'm not okay i'm not i'm i'm

2868
02:39:19,900 --> 02:39:39,260
see the the problem here was you didn't want to block so he just kept getting like free damage out of you how did he know technically he can uh what's it called you can just punish that uh you can look at him you can pause matchmaking and look at my screen yeah in case you face him again

2869
02:39:44,790 --> 02:40:45,730
so he does this yeah you can you can drive impact in the middle or you can block and just use your auto combo your jab auto combo oh okay the light oh no not the jab auto combo just use the jab headbutt the jab hip yeah like this oh okay punish okay or if you use just a headbutt it's i mean a drive impacted okay at worst case scenario you just uh what's it called you use the ex headbutt gotcha like this i understand okay but i don't even need to know that because i don't fight a luke so okay yeah i mean it's not in the tournament you don't have to yeah yeah i don't have to worry about it to be fair i don't i just need to remember how to block that's the most important part all right yeah because you're just getting free hits Let's get this lucky.

2870
02:40:45,890 --> 02:40:47,890
I just need to remember how to block.

2871
02:40:50,650 --> 02:40:52,650
Oh my god.

2872
02:40:53,550 --> 02:40:53,950
Zangief.

02:41:01,750 --> 02:41:02,970
I'm so scared.

2878
02:41:04,270 --> 02:41:06,270
A fight with my pass.

You need to get close to me.

2884
02:41:56,020 --> 02:41:56,740
That's right.

2885
02:41:56,900 --> 02:41:57,240
Nice.

2886
02:41:57,980 --> 02:41:58,800
That's why I hate it.

2887
02:41:58,880 --> 02:42:00,120
That's why I'm not playing you now.

2888
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:02,460
Because I know I can't get close to you.

2889
02:42:02,900 --> 02:42:03,200

2890
02:42:03,580 --> 02:42:04,120

I got him.

2894
02:42:08,560 --> 02:42:08,920
Oh.

2895
02:42:11,260 --> 02:42:11,360
Oh.

2896
02:42:11,820 --> 02:42:11,980
Oh.

2897
02:42:11,980 --> 02:42:12,080
Oh.

2898
02:42:12,440 --> 02:42:12,800
Stop.

2899
02:42:13,060 --> 02:42:13,380
Stop.

2900
02:42:13,700 --> 02:42:14,020
Stop.

2901
02:42:14,720 --> 02:42:15,820
Don't get close to me.

2902
02:42:17,500 --> 02:42:17,860
Stop.

2903
02:42:18,280 --> 02:42:18,620
Oh.

2904
02:42:21,460 --> 02:42:22,500
All right.

2905
02:42:23,520 --> 02:42:24,260
Don't get close.

2906
02:42:24,480 --> 02:42:24,960
Don't get close.

2907
02:42:26,300 --> 02:42:26,700
That's right.

2908
02:42:28,040 --> 02:42:30,800
No, you need to chill with your headbutts.

2909
02:42:31,600 --> 02:42:32,120
Oh my gosh.

2910
02:42:35,300 --> 02:42:35,520
Oh.

2911
02:42:38,920 --> 02:42:40,400
Oh my god.

2912
02:42:41,580 --> 02:42:42,960
After he blocks the headbutt jump.

2913
02:42:49,780 --> 02:42:50,020
Stop.

2914
02:42:50,980 --> 02:42:51,640
Oh fuck.

2915
02:42:51,740 --> 02:42:52,800
I didn't protect my ankles.

2916
02:42:53,580 --> 02:42:53,660
Yeah.

2917
02:42:54,120 --> 02:42:54,140
My ankles.

2918
02:42:55,080 --> 02:42:56,680
My poor ankles.

2919
02:42:58,160 --> 02:43:01,060
So after you do the headbutt and he blocks it, try jumping.

2920
02:43:01,840 --> 02:43:02,100
Okay.

2921
02:43:06,700 --> 02:43:07,700
Yeah, if he blocks.

2922
02:43:08,080 --> 02:43:08,500
Okay, yeah, yeah.

2923
02:43:08,540 --> 02:43:08,940
If he blocks.

2924
02:43:10,440 --> 02:43:10,660
Jump.

2925
02:43:11,220 --> 02:43:11,640
Yeah!

2926
02:43:13,040 --> 02:43:15,140
This is why I can't play you anymore!

2927
02:43:21,220 --> 02:43:22,500
Oh my god.

2928
02:43:22,880 --> 02:43:23,000
Oh!

2929
02:43:23,080 --> 02:43:23,340
Nice.

2930
02:43:23,660 --> 02:43:24,480
It went out.

2931
02:43:25,560 --> 02:43:26,080
Yeah!

2932
02:43:26,680 --> 02:43:28,560
I got level three too!

2933
02:43:28,840 --> 02:43:29,600
Get out of here!

2934
02:43:30,420 --> 02:43:30,940
Oh!

2935
02:43:31,700 --> 02:43:32,660
How did you do that?

2936
02:43:33,200 --> 02:43:34,280
How did you do that?

2937
02:43:34,280 --> 02:43:35,320
How did you even miss that?

2938
02:43:36,020 --> 02:43:36,140
Yeah!

2939
02:43:39,960 --> 02:43:41,000
I'm fast!

2940
02:43:42,340 --> 02:43:43,380
Holy shit!

2941
02:43:44,160 --> 02:43:46,080
And I'm so...

2942
02:43:48,520 --> 02:43:49,460
Oh my god.

2943
02:43:52,480 --> 02:43:53,000
Okay.

2944
02:43:54,300 --> 02:43:55,100
You can end this.

2945
02:43:55,560 --> 02:43:55,720
No!

2946
02:43:55,900 --> 02:43:56,360
No!

2947
02:43:56,520 --> 02:43:56,580
Don't!

2948
02:43:56,740 --> 02:43:56,780
Don't!

2949
02:43:56,820 --> 02:43:56,940
No!

2950
02:43:57,380 --> 02:43:57,500
No!

2951
02:43:57,900 --> 02:43:58,080
No!

2952
02:43:58,440 --> 02:43:58,880
No!

2953
02:44:00,860 --> 02:44:02,560
That's the chase!

2954
02:44:05,280 --> 02:44:06,280
That's a lot!

2955
02:44:06,720 --> 02:44:07,220
I don't know.

2956
02:44:07,380 --> 02:44:12,820
To be fair, to be fair, to be fair, honestly speaking, being blunt, you deserve that loss.

2957
02:44:14,860 --> 02:44:16,560
Because you dropped that combo at the end.

2958
02:44:17,740 --> 02:44:18,440
That was a kill.

2959
02:44:18,560 --> 02:44:19,620
That was a guaranteed kill.

2960
02:44:22,420 --> 02:44:24,240
I don't know what I did.

2961
02:44:24,980 --> 02:44:30,120
I need to start, I need to stop saying this.

2962
02:44:30,160 --> 02:44:43,340
I don't know what to do with all that confidence.

2963
02:44:43,720 --> 02:44:44,000
I'm not.

2964
02:44:46,840 --> 02:44:47,400
Okay.

2965
02:44:48,200 --> 02:44:48,400
Okay.

2966
02:44:48,400 --> 02:44:48,420
There

2967
02:44:53,430 --> 02:44:55,450
we go.

2968
02:44:58,090 --> 02:44:59,150
Oh, oh, oh.

2969
02:44:59,350 --> 02:45:00,790
Now you don't drop it.

2970
02:45:02,430 --> 02:45:03,950
Now you don't drop it.

2971
02:45:08,930 --> 02:45:12,050
They might have made a mistake there.

2972
02:45:12,250 --> 02:45:16,970
I couldn't help.

2973
02:45:17,230 --> 02:45:18,110
Oh shit.

2974
02:45:19,050 --> 02:45:20,050
Go back, go back, go back.

2975
02:45:20,690 --> 02:45:21,430
Oh, where did I go?

2976
02:45:24,270 --> 02:45:25,850
I should have gone back.

2977
02:45:26,750 --> 02:45:29,530
Yeah, get your meter back first and then you can go in.

2978
02:45:35,340 --> 02:45:35,620

02:49:29,490 --> 02:49:32,010
You have to admit, it did work.

I just...

3061
02:49:35,190 --> 02:49:38,210
Now she's making sure I don't get close to her.

3062
02:49:38,790 --> 02:49:40,750
Look, look, look, she's adapting!

Oh, can I remind you to kill them?

3072
02:49:58,850 --> 02:50:02,130
That's how you do it.

3073
02:50:03,930 --> 02:50:05,010
You figured out the formula.

3074
02:50:05,150 --> 02:50:06,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3075
02:50:08,590 --> 02:50:09,190

Oh my god, she's changing up her...

3083
02:50:34,670 --> 02:50:36,210
She's mixing it up now.

3084
02:50:36,890 --> 02:50:37,550
It's illegal.

3085
02:50:39,330 --> 02:50:40,470
Oh, Toe Kit.

3086
02:50:43,090 --> 02:50:44,170

02:50:46,890 --> 02:50:47,290

Oh, I don't...

3090
02:50:50,850 --> 02:50:53,090
When you jump, press your heavy button.

3091
02:50:53,310 --> 02:50:53,410
Okay.

3092
02:50:55,790 --> 02:50:56,650
There you go.

3093
02:50:56,850 --> 02:50:57,790
Yeah, like that.

3094
02:50:58,750 --> 02:51:00,170

02:51:05,990 --> 02:51:06,870
Okay, there you go.

3100
02:51:06,950 --> 02:51:07,190
Nice.

Oh, I thought I'd get mine first.

3102
02:51:11,850 --> 02:51:12,730
There you go.

3103
02:51:13,650 --> 02:51:14,170
Nope.

3104
02:51:17,090 --> 02:51:18,250
Huh, that's right.

3105
02:51:21,590 --> 02:51:22,850
There we go.

3106
02:51:26,850 --> 02:51:28,610
Get over here!

3107
02:51:31,630 --> 02:51:36,390
So you basically stopped playing Zangief and you went to another character that basically does the same thing.

3108
02:51:37,210 --> 02:51:38,090
Oh, damn it!

3109
02:51:38,090 --> 02:51:39,550
I was gonna grab her!

3110
02:51:40,470 --> 02:51:40,750
Nice.

3111
02:51:40,830 --> 02:51:42,210
This is what I do in Zangief!

3112
02:51:43,310 --> 02:51:44,490
You just grabbed you?

3113
02:51:44,750 --> 02:51:45,270
Yeah!

3114
02:51:45,630 --> 02:51:47,850
Oh my god, she won't let me grab her anymore!

3115
02:51:48,150 --> 02:51:49,130
I don't understand!

3116
02:51:49,610 --> 02:51:50,370
That was fantastic!

3117
02:51:50,870 --> 02:51:51,350
Stress!

3118
02:51:53,810 --> 02:51:54,590
There you go.

3119
02:51:55,730 --> 02:51:56,470
There you go.

3120
02:51:58,490 --> 02:51:59,290
Oh shit.

3121
02:51:59,670 --> 02:52:00,170
Not nice.

3122
02:52:01,350 --> 02:52:03,430
That's not, oh god, that's not nice anymore.

3123
02:52:03,590 --> 02:52:04,350
Believe me too, build me too.

3124
02:52:05,070 --> 02:52:05,310
Jump.

3125
02:52:06,070 --> 02:52:06,170

02:52:14,650 --> 02:52:15,610
Oh, okay.

3128
02:52:16,430 --> 02:52:18,070
That was gonna be it.

3129
02:52:20,090 --> 02:52:21,730
Oh my god, we're so scared.

3130
02:52:22,130 --> 02:52:23,070
We're both so scared.

3131
02:52:26,440 --> 02:52:28,620
Oh, it's too far too far.

3135
02:52:34,100 --> 02:52:36,620
We're both so scared.

And...

3137
02:52:43,540 --> 02:52:44,180

That was nice.

3144
02:52:53,380 --> 02:52:54,340

That's unlucky.

3155

02:54:31,500 --> 02:54:33,540
Don't be afraid to use a regular headbutt.

3164
02:54:35,280 --> 02:54:36,700
Here we go, come on.

3165
02:54:38,360 --> 02:54:39,760
Ah ha ha!

3166
02:54:41,440 --> 02:54:43,880
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah.

3167
02:54:43,920 --> 02:54:45,700
This is the kind of match you want to play campy a bit.

3168
02:54:45,980 --> 02:54:49,020
Yeah, yeah, that's right, that's right.

3169
02:54:50,100 --> 02:54:50,380
Nice.

3170
02:54:51,400 --> 02:54:52,140
Oh, shit!

3171
02:54:53,280 --> 02:54:54,780
Get off of me!

3172
02:54:58,340 --> 02:54:59,600
Oh, fuck, okay.

3173
02:54:59,780 --> 02:55:01,520
He was too mad, he got a bit.

3174
02:55:02,480 --> 02:55:03,860
Oh my god, that was half my HP.

3175
02:55:07,540 --> 02:55:12,260
Oh, oh, no, what the fuck is oh my god.

3176
02:55:13,200 --> 02:55:14,040
Oh, hey, you're fine.

3177
02:55:15,060 --> 02:55:22,740
Um, um, um, what did we say about saying you're fine?

3178
02:55:23,340 --> 02:55:23,820
Okay, I'm sorry.

3179
02:55:24,100 --> 02:55:24,320
I'm sorry.

3180
02:55:26,880 --> 02:55:27,480
I forgot.

3181
02:55:27,480 --> 02:55:27,760
I forgot.

3182
02:55:32,420 --> 02:55:34,400
It's because he said I was fine.

3183
02:55:34,700 --> 02:55:35,540
Guys, these cells.

3184
02:55:35,980 --> 02:55:38,660
Every time I say, every time I said you're fine, you literally lost your life.

3185
02:55:38,740 --> 02:55:39,700
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

3186
02:55:39,860 --> 02:55:42,060
It's when my brain was like, she's not fine.

3187
02:55:44,380 --> 02:55:45,940
What do you mean it's all my fault?

3188
02:55:46,100 --> 02:55:46,720
It's not my fault.

3189
02:55:46,880 --> 02:55:47,340
Yeah, no, no.

3190
02:55:47,740 --> 02:55:49,120
It's a, it's a pattern.

3191
02:55:49,280 --> 02:55:52,540
Every time you said I'm fine, it's never fine.

3192
02:55:52,740 --> 02:55:53,420
It's a pattern.

3193
02:55:56,760 --> 02:55:58,140
But yeah, I don't.

3194
02:55:58,820 --> 02:56:02,620
I feel like I would be, I'll have very bad timing if I do this.

3195
02:56:05,520 --> 02:56:33,560
I know the good thing about this is if you headbutt someone and you say you landed a hit if you drive rush you can continue the pressure oh I see so for example yeah for example if I do this see okay so okay something like a bit more advanced they can learn later okay alright if I play this game after the tournament basically

3196
02:56:39,180 --> 02:57:08,440
oh man we got this guys we got this I can win at least one game the only the only problem with me telling you you're fine is as soon as they say you're fine you start panicking and you get hit by literally everything that's not what you're fine supposed to mean you're fine supposed to make you calm not panic it's because I'm like am I actually fine I don't know He told me I'm fine.

3197
02:57:08,760 --> 02:57:11,360
I just forget everything you've taught me.

3198
02:57:13,020 --> 02:57:14,720
All right, I'm going to need to tell you're cooked.

3199
02:57:15,180 --> 02:57:15,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3200
02:57:15,880 --> 02:57:19,060
I'm cooked, and now it would be like, I'm like, I'm not cooked.

3201
02:57:19,280 --> 02:57:20,420
I'll prove you wrong.

3202
02:57:20,820 --> 02:57:23,100
And then I unlock my third eye.

3203
02:57:26,160 --> 02:57:26,860
It's okay.

3204
02:57:26,900 --> 02:57:27,980
We got this, guys.

3205
02:57:28,500 --> 02:57:29,200
I believe.

3206
02:57:29,480 --> 02:57:32,420
I believe in Big Bird, who believes in me.

3207
02:57:33,380 --> 02:57:34,360
I do believe in you.

3208
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:45,100
you believe in me guys but the problem is you don't believe in yourself like i do yeah because i yeah but i believe in you i don't believe in myself i believe in you

3209
02:57:51,060 --> 02:59:08,300
this is gonna work guys i think i might have to bounce after the next all right next game will be the lg i will prove to you big bird i will do to you everything you've taught me i'll show you everything you've taught me during the last game and i might lose but it doesn't matter if you lose or you win as long as you're learning as long as i do the moves you taught me you're fine i'll be fine where the fuck are the players i have five players cancelled on me do they know did i want and done too many people that they don't want to fight they all blocked it yeah they all blocked me they all blocked me is that why my cues are so long now guys i'm blocked me please i need to show my coach or it might be or it might be like 12 a.m right now yeah no no that can't be it that can't be are you sure this is peak gaming hours this is the hours where everyone should be gaming well to be fair you had like a rotation of five players that you were playing in a row that's true and you kept one and

3210
02:59:08,300 --> 03:00:33,160
gunning them so maybe they all blocked you oh no why would they block me why you ask me why i don't understand there's not a lot of us come on you gotta take what you can get i don't understand all right uh what you need to do uh cancel the matchmaking and then put it on again okay wait wait maybe okay maybe that's it oh wait it's searching i can't escape oh oh it won't let me press escape that means they found someone i think i can't leave when there's that like uh oh a communication error oh no oh my god my game doesn't even want me to fight another person like oh no oh okay there you go all right off all right turn it off and then turn it on all right and then we'll do all we'll end it on someone with one bar or some i don't care like are you sure you don't care yeah it's fine if i'm lagging they're lagging so we we can both suffer all right okay i swear to god if this is the I swear the guy.

3211
03:00:36,540 --> 03:00:36,940
Oh, my God.

3212
03:00:37,100 --> 03:00:38,300
It's a new Aki.

3213
03:00:39,820 --> 03:00:41,300

I had a great time being coached by Big Bird.

3303
03:06:15,980 --> 03:06:16,700
Big bird.

3304
03:06:18,240 --> 03:06:18,820
Oh my god.

I don't know why I was so scared in the beginning.

3306

03:06:29,320 --> 03:06:29,660
Stop.

Oh my god.

3313
03:06:32,660 --> 03:06:33,320
The alley kick.

3314
03:06:33,580 --> 03:06:35,040
And nobody blocks this.

3315
03:06:35,320 --> 03:06:35,480
No.

3316
03:06:35,540 --> 03:06:35,740
Okay.

3317
03:06:35,740 --> 03:06:36,320
Except for him.

3318
03:06:36,320 --> 03:06:36,760
He's a bot.

3319
03:06:36,800 --> 03:06:37,720
He's meant to block it.

3320
03:06:37,880 --> 03:06:38,520
But nobody.

3321
03:06:38,800 --> 03:06:40,100
I found out.

3322
03:06:40,120 --> 03:06:42,140
Nobody actually blocks this.

3323
03:06:43,980 --> 03:06:44,860
And stop.

3324
03:06:45,460 --> 03:06:45,820
Stop.

3325
03:06:48,400 --> 03:07:16,400

3326
03:07:16,720 --> 03:07:20,680
this brings back alley-kick memories, guys.

3327
03:07:21,020 --> 03:07:25,580
This brings back alley-kick memories.

3328
03:07:25,760 --> 03:07:26,560
It's not as good.

3329
03:07:27,020 --> 03:07:27,980
Not as good.

3330
03:07:28,660 --> 03:07:30,800
This, this, not as good as this.

3331
03:07:33,240 --> 03:07:35,040
But I think I improved a lot.

3332
03:07:35,120 --> 03:07:40,480
I think I improved a lot today, and I learned a lot of cool moves.

3333
03:07:41,520 --> 03:07:42,700
One last butt slap.

3334
03:07:42,800 --> 03:07:44,100
If I can pull it off.

3335
03:07:44,820 --> 03:07:45,420

3336
03:07:45,980 --> 03:07:48,380
Oh, look, I pulled it off.

3337
03:07:49,700 --> 03:07:52,800
But, um, I'm gonna head off now.

3338
03:07:53,540 --> 03:07:54,180
Tomorrow's no stream.

3339
03:07:54,320 --> 03:08:01,580
I might show up on Nephew's stream for the extra coaching on the Capcom channel, the Capcom Fighters channel.

3340
03:08:03,120 --> 03:08:04,580
And I won't be there for too long.

3341
03:08:05,340 --> 03:08:06,980
But thank you all for watching.

3342
03:08:07,240 --> 03:08:10,300
As always, everybody, stay hydrated, posture check.

3343
03:08:10,560 --> 03:08:12,520
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

3344
03:08:12,660 --> 03:08:15,960
And if you stay up from me, head to bed, because you deserve it.

3345
03:08:15,980 --> 03:08:19,600
