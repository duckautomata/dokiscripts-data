50
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,940

51
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,660

52
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,920
I'm training, I'm training my human right now, okay?

53
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,860
But yes.

54
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:48,980
um unfortunately dokeybird prime sent you to the wrong um the wrong dokeyverse she was supposed to send you to like you know the scary dokeyverse but i guess you know you took the right turn instead of the left turn so now you're in my dokeyverse now i mean it is pretty scary we have mondays every day that's already pretty scary

55
00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:21,580
welcome back it has been um a year since we last saw each other unless you're our members well you guys get to see me anytime you want but but it has been a year for the for the other regular goons out here it's crazy like you guys don't have odi goons back in back in your area i don't understand are they not why don't they exist there

56
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:55,160
but anyway anyway i'm hungry god get some more lasagna yum yum yum yum um but anyway well since you're here i do have i guess i guess i could entertain you guys for a little bit before we send you back to your original universe you know um um So yeah,

57
00:08:55,340 --> 00:09:09,780
I do have, I guess, you know, I guess I could fucking put some stuff together for all of you guys, because it's Halloween for all of you, so it's not like this little hellhole that I have here where every day is Monday.

58
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:36,720
every day is Monday what I do every day I sleep hoping hoping the Monday ends but it never ends that's the thing it never ends

59
00:09:40,930 --> 00:10:46,030
the worst episode it's oh every day it's been Monday for so many I don't even know what other days come after Monday I don't even know anymore but before before I show you around and give you guys a little spooky Halloween day we gotta do a little hashtag ad because you don't escape you don't escape even though you jump joki versus you can never escape the ads anyway joki bird prime told me to tell you guys this too like i just received from my it's just received um a little message a little dm from joki bird prime but if you guys look pinned in my chat right now you for 24 hours by the way 24 hours I should be happy about this.

60
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,550
For 24 hours.

61
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,220
For 24 hours.

62
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:00,520
You can grab a free trading card where I'm on it.

63
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,080
The Halloween themed.

64
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,180
Well, not me, but Dokey Bird Prime.

65
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:05,940
But you can get a.

66
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,480
I wish I could be on the V cards.

67
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,100
But unfortunately.

68
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,860
I think legally that.

69
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,300
Legally.

70
00:11:16,380 --> 00:12:46,200
I could be in trouble but anyway um you can grab a free trading card right now for 24 hours one day only um and yeah free shipping too by the way you don't have to pay for shipping and also there is like a play mat as well for the retro dokey verse um but you gotta pay for that sorry that's not free but the trading card's free and you just gotta do like and you guys want to buy the other up at gamer subs just do use the code dokeybird for 10% off yeah jam davis would he's still alive how are i'll wait until he's dead before i try to go through the legal loopholes um and anyway um anyway um that's the hashtag and also for those who are wondering where did it how was doki field how did doki field come into being well if you guys remembered um the original doki field which is me was made by uh goblin this is goblin um and i was like i want to be able to you know look at a different angles and like hold you know hold my coffee and he's like but this time you know how okay you don't see me

71
00:12:46,200 --> 00:13:46,080
often right it's because it was really hard to get a hold of me in the dokeyverse because it was very very difficult for for dokeybird prime to like set up the portal to connect to me but so we had a little solution uh for halloween so for halloween we decided you remember dokeybug well i i hooked up with dokeybug not that type of up that's fucked up i i i bumped into doki but during the doki council and during the our annual doki council meetings and i was like oh and then i was like you know what you know could we make this portal stuff a little easier so um uh doki bug hooked me up with neil and she made the whole the Doki Field verse a lot easier now.

72
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,820
So technically I can come up whenever I want.

73
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,060
So now, now, now it's a lot easier now.

74
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:02,520
So I don't, like, Doki Bird Prime doesn't have to be lazy anymore.

75
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,780
Well, Doki Bird Prime will still continue to be lazy.

76
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:11,360
But this time, it'll be so much easier to access my portal.

77
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:31,880
so you helped helped made it possible in terms of like you know making me I guess move so huge shout out to you and also goblin for getting all this set up so yeah now now you can access me more easily

78
00:14:36,680 --> 00:15:47,920
but yes we also updated my other version like you know where I look at you guys like right now I'm not looking at you guys because I don't want you guys to look at me I'm obviously a mess right now like every version of dokey is a mess so um I can all right give me a sec let me uh let me disappear for a sec for those who want to know um I'll disappear for a little bit and where is it all right give me a sec all right we're gonna go back to our usual usual room you guys will remember there we go so as you guys can see I got a little bit of an update as well shoot that no it's just we just got frame drops too we don't see oti-goon is back you guys want to see him again oti-goon oti-goon get over here there he is there he is you miss him

79
00:15:51,640 --> 00:16:08,760
no dad is dad dad is john dad our buckle don't you guys remember i trained my human very well so um with this i am the new and improved doke field watch this wow

80
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,340
Look at that.

81
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,220
I can squeeze it.

82
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,060
Look at that.

83
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:16,860
Look at that.

84
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,660
This is my, this is my teddy bear, but now it's a croaky.

85
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,340
Look at that.

86
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,280
No, I'm not Garfield.

87
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,680
I'm legally distinct dokeyfield.

88
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,140
Um, very legally distinct, obviously.

89
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:40,580
Uh, but yes, now I have croaky, but I also have, I also have the tomato, tomato.

90
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,640
We all have tomatoes in the inside.

91
00:16:42,740 --> 00:17:05,780
by the way every dokey in every dokeyverse has a little tomato in the inside but look at that it's my little stress ball too uh that's my it's pookie but but not pookie it's legally distinct pookie guys look at him and then i also have you know it should be

92
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:17,640
don't look at me don't look at me

93
00:17:22,040 --> 00:18:49,520
and then we also obviously the classic the classic laughing that i can do oh yeah this is a little bonus by the way don't put clothes in back expand oh and then obviously we remember this we remember this a little look at that guys my arms can move who would have thought whoa whoa but i can also point um excuse me i'm actually um um i'm actually yeah and then hello everybody welcome to the doki doki field verse uh but yes this is um new and improved uh new and improved dokefield um revamped hd 5080 rtx on um so yeah i'm not more easily accessible through the doke verse portals uh so doke bird prime whenever she doesn't want to do her work she can i guess pull me in and i have to be forced to entertain you guys instead of doke bird prime which is which is fine which is fine i'm not i'm not complaining you know It was better than being stuck here.

94
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,700
I mean, technically, you guys are brought here.

95
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,840
So you have to experience the Eternal Mondays that I have to go through every day.

96
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:03,000
Oh, to be fair, she is Doki Bird Prime.

97
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,320
So she is, there's a tier system on the Doki's.

98
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,560
Obviously at the very bottom is Shibidoki.

99
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:17,380
And, and through, because she only got in through blood relations.

100
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:54,200
um but then there's a tier system at the very top it's uh it's dokeyberg prime and then um i'm above dokey bug only because i came over here first and uh we all the dokeys love dokeyfield um so i get to be above dokey bug uh but yes there is a tier there is a hierarchy of power so you can be command um if you're if a dokey and a dokeyverse is a higher tier than you You have to listen to that Doki and because Doki Bird Prime is the highest tier Yeah,

101
00:19:54,220 --> 00:20:01,580
Chibi Doki got in through nepotism But she's still at the very bottom of the hierarchy of the Doki verse hierarchy

102
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:19,720
So because Doki Bird Prime is at the very she's prime like if she dies like we all die So, you know, we can't let anything happen to her so in the very top The Doki verse is Doki Bird Prime So we all have to listen to her.

103
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:31,640
So if I have to entertain you guys on Halloween, I guess I have to be here Like yeah, I don't have rights apparently Um, but it's okay the jokies below me also don't have rights.

104
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,920
So you know what's crazy?

105
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:49,460
I'm in a higher tier than jokitty I I'm technically the superior Jokie cat so I'm on the I'm a higher tier than jokitty So, I mean, it's not crazy.

106
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,620
I mean, it's very obvious.

107
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,200
It's obvious.

108
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,940
I am the best cat in all the docuverses.

109
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,820
So, that's crazy.

110
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,600
What are you trying to say, huh?

111
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,980
What are you trying to say?

112
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:05,400
Huh?

113
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,920
Don't make, I'm tired.

114
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:11,900
I'm going to give me a sec.

115
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:24,560

So yeah, so unfortunately, you guys are going to be here in the Doki Field Dokiverse now for Halloween.

122
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,080
Every Doki has sleep issues.

123
00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:10,320
Unfortunately, not for, well, I mean there was nothing else I can do, you know, if every day is Monday I might as well sleep because eventually if I keep sleeping Um, if I keep sleeping eventually my the Mondays would stop right

It's my favorite Doka Field game.

198
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:28,020
You have to find seven packages of goodies hidden in the haunted house.

199
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:34,020
Search the room for things that will help you find the goodies in the guard.

200
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,040
Click on the items to pick them up.

201
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,300
Don't get too scared.

202
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:43,480
Use the arrow keys on your keyboard or the arrows on screen to move from room to room.

203
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:44,600
All right.

204
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,880
Haunted house?

205
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:49,900
Donuts.

206
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:55,680
All right.

207
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,680
We gotta find our donuts, guys.

208
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:02,520
I don't know if, um, it was spooky.

209
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,140
Spooky.

210
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,540
So scary.

211
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:08,940
All right.

212
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,340
Is my, are any of my sound guys alive?

213
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,300
Okay, the front door.

214
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:15,160
I actually, I don't remember how, this has been so long since I played.

215
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,200
I used to play this all the time.

216
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,060
Okay, we found the front door.

217
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,600
I played this all the time growing up.

218
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,480
Like, I'm not joking.

219
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:30,260
Because I never, I only finished it one time.

220
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,780
Because, you know how it's like a browser game.

221
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,700
And so you can't save it.

222
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:38,380
So every time I try to play this game, I never got to finish it.

223
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,900
Because, like, it would be, like, too late or something.

224
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,700
Or, oh, hey, hey, John.

225
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,260
Hey, John, Dad Buckle.

226
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:48,260
Listen very close, carefully to the music in the music room.

227
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:52,460
Alright, Godfield, Adonka Field, stop giving cheese to the mice.

228
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,400
Lyman loves it.

229
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,920
Who the fuck is Lyman?

230
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,820
The code for the safest outside.

231
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,620
Oh, he's like the hint guy.

232
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,700
Dad Buckles gives me hints.

233
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,740
Yeah, I was never, I only finished it one time.

234
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:36,320
Because like I said, like, every time I try to finish this game, stuck and i give up or like it got too late so i had to like restart it and then like every couple of weeks i'll try to play this game real ones remember oh he's that guy oh okay i couldn't help it whoa okay maybe i should stop wait but what if this is different no

235
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:51,720
what if it'll be different this time it can't all be spooky How is I supposed to know they were all spooky?

236
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,040
The grave mistake.

237
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:56,800
Oh, this is different.

238
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,600
I have a shovel.

239
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,260
61978.

240
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,800
Oh, that has to be important.

241
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,860
Guys, remember this.

242
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,960
Guys, remember this for me.

243
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:05,900

Stop!

248
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,120
My heart can't take this.

249
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,560
It's so scary.

I can't trust you guys.

257
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:23,310
You're rats.

258
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:25,370
Never trust the rats.

259
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:26,490
Rats.

260
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:27,490
Rats.

261
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:30,650
Never trust the rats.

262
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:35,970
All right, I'll go this way.

263
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:37,570
Whoa.

264
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:41,050
Oh, wait.

265
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:42,290
Let me...

266
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:43,270
Go this way.

267
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:45,990
Those dang rats.

268
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:48,230
What are they trying to do?

269
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:51,830
What are these goddamn rats trying to do?

270
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:56,410
I feel like there's something for this bookshelf that I'm supposed to...

271
00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:58,770
There's something...

272
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:01,090
I feel like I have to put a book in that bookshelf.

273
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:04,790
Alright, this way.

274
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:07,230
I guess we have to go up.

275
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:10,030
Or right?

276
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,070
Well, I didn't go right.

277
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:12,330
Okay, I feel like if I...

278
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:13,130
Maybe, oh.

279
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:17,450
Maybe it'll be different.

280
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:18,290
I don't know.

281
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:20,770
Alright, they can't all be scary.

282
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:24,570
Maybe it'll be not scary.

283
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:25,670
Maybe something...

284
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,490
Okay, the fire is nice and warm.

285
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:28,470
That's good to know.

286
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:32,450
Alright, let's go back up there.

287
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,480
Let's see.

288
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,800
I have the red door key.

289
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,520
Maybe it'll be...

290
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,620
Oh, nice door there!

291
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,760
I found a bag of mini-sinole.

292
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:44,920
and donuts!

293
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,520
Lyman should be here somewhere.

294
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:51,900
Oh, shit!

295
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:52,720
Is that Lyman?

296
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,700
Okay, maybe there'll be... Oh, hello.

297
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,980
Wait, he's just friendly.

298
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,480
Okay, guys, I might die.

299
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,920
Okay, guys, it's not looking so good for me.

300
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,820
Maybe something different?

301
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,560
Oh, I'm at Scarrow now.

302
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,900
Okay, Blue Key.

303
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,160

305
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,000
I had no deductive reasoning at all.

306
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:51,180
Like, I'm like playing this.

307
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,500
I was like, wait a minute.

308
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,460
Wait a minute.

309
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,480
Yes, you were.

310
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,940
And so was I.

311
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,020
I did not.

312
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,140
Oh, shit.

313
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:01,760
Okay.

314
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,400
Maybe it'll be different here.

315
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,280
Hey.

316
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,280
Why am I afraid of you?

317
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,760
You're just a naked man.

318
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,500
I was just clicking everything.

319
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,540
I don't know what I was clicking.

320
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,180
All right, here.

321
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:19,980
I can't even read in this universe.

322
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,240
None of the- Okay, except for a smart dokey in the dokeyverse, she can read.

323
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:27,480
But, like, but she ain't that special.

324
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,140
We don't fuck care.

325
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,740
She has to read for all of us.

326
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,840
Oh, yeah, no, he's gonna do a jump scare.

327
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,300
You know what?

328
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,880
I don't have a lot.

329
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,520
I only have a meter left.

330
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,920
I don't have a lot of scare.

331
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,960
What are they supposed to do?

332
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,520
Just chilling up here.

333
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:47,020
Hello?

334
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,160
What's your purpose?

335
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,140
I don't have a chest.

336
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,760
I don't have a key for that chest.

337
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,580
What the fuck is your purpose?

338
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:03,720
Bats can't spell.

339
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,060
Can you help them?

340
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:07,420
Oh.

341
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:08,380
Okay.

342
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,060
What do you want to spell?

343
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:13,760
What?

344
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,240
I don't know what they want me to do.

345
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:39,820

347
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,360
What if I wasn't reading that?

348
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:55,020
But I don't know how to read anyway, but, you know?

349
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,760
Oh, wait, flashlight.

350
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,440
Wait, how do I use the flashlight?

351
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:03,290
Only have Eater left.

352
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:04,830
This is the filter.

353
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:05,390
This is it.

354
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:06,530
This is where I lost.

355
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:08,150
Now I understand now.

356
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:08,970
Now.

357
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:15,390
Now, little dokey understands.

358
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:18,130
I understand little dokey now.

359
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:22,810
Where else can I go?

360
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:25,150
I feel like I went everywhere.

361
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:28,070
There has to be a safe somewhere.

362
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:32,910
Oh, there's a safe.

363
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:33,830
Wait, I never used it.

364
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:34,070
Wait.

365
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:36,370
There was a safe here.

366
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:37,570
Oh, wait.

367
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:38,550
There's a red door.

368
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:41,870
I thought I could use that, but apparently I can't.

369
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:44,830
Oh, nice.

370
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:45,210
There it is.

371
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:45,850
All right, guys.

372
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:46,570

00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:28,690
Oh my god, it actually won't let me- Oh my god, I have to- Oh my god, I actually have to restart the game.

377
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:31,990
Oh, the game will never be done.

378
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:34,930

00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:10,290
I don't need to talk to you, John.

382
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:11,950
Get out of here, John.

383
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,870

00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:21,090
I knew it.

387
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:23,990
I knew it.

388
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:26,170
This always happens on Monday.

389
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:28,250
But every day it's Monday.

390
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:29,950
So it always happens.

391
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:34,930

00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:12,390

Oh, wait.

407
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:26,750
And then we got the green key.

408
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:27,090
Look at that.

409
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:29,250

00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:30,670
Alright, I should do the red.

00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:35,610
I swear to God.

413
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:36,790

Um, wait, maybe I'm so sad

435
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:03,500

438
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:30,340
I don't understand!

439
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:33,420
Why does it suck?

440
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:38,730
Oh, maybe you're right.

441
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:39,290
Okay.

442
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:42,470
Okay, no ad blocker.

443
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:43,870
Wait, is that it?

444
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:45,570
Is that it?

445
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:47,690
Is it because of ad blocker?

446
00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:49,030
Is it...

447
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:52,370
We can do this!

448
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:55,310
We can do this!

449
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:57,850
I turned on it.

450
00:48:58,030 --> 00:48:58,270
Okay.

451
00:48:58,710 --> 00:48:58,850
All right.

452
00:48:58,950 --> 00:48:59,510
We go straight.

453
00:48:59,650 --> 00:48:59,810
Okay.

454
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:04,410
We're going to go straight to the red room.

455
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:06,270
For real this time.

456
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:09,290
I turned off my ad blocker.

457
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,190
I'm part of the problem.

458
00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:13,930
I turned it off.

459
00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:14,930
All right.

460
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:15,890
One more.

461
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:16,630
Take three.

462
00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:19,210
Take three.

463
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:23,990
This is why Lil Doki never like finished this game one time.

464
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:25,710
She played this for like.

465
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:27,270
Three plus years.

466
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:29,110
And she only beat it one time.

467
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:31,050
And it was the last time she played it.

468
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:34,250
That was hell.

469
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:35,390
I actually, I couldn't.

470
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:36,990
I never even beat.

471
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:40,230
The Cartoon Network trick-or-treat games too.

472
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:42,830
Because I never read.

473
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:44,370
This is it.

474
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:47,650
No!

475
00:49:48,330 --> 00:49:48,870
I'm looking.

476
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:49,170
Google.

477
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:49,910
Someone Google.

478
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:54,370
There has to be.

479
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:55,530
There has to.

480
00:49:56,150 --> 00:50:13,270
There has to be another, there has to be another Garfield scary scavenger hunt play, there has to be another version where I can play this, I refuse.

481
00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:24,430
There has to be another site where I can beat this game.

482
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:26,370
What?

483
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:27,430
Okay, I found it.

484
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,230
I found it.

485
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:32,810
I won't be beat.

486
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:34,860
There you go.

487
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:40,770
I found another one.

488
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:42,250
I did it.

489
00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:45,650
I must complete this for little dokey.

490
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:49,090
All right, here you go.

491
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:51,710
All right.

492
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:53,030
Got another one.

493
00:50:53,770 --> 00:50:55,790
I found...

494
00:50:55,790 --> 00:51:00,070
I found another one, but I have to, okay, we gotta redo this though.

495
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:06,090
I found another one, but I gotta redo this, so it works.

496
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:14,990
Alright, okay, look, I know it looks a little fuck-fuck-y right now, but it's because I had to find another version, so give me a sec.

497
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:19,950
Oh, alright.

498
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:26,050
I found another version that we can use.

499
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:28,850
All right.

500
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:30,330
Here we go.

501
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:32,750
And then, Scarameter.

502
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:34,990
All right.

503
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:36,710
There we go.

504
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:41,380
This should be it.

505
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:42,720
All right.

506
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:44,460
Now.

507
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:46,120
Now.

508
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:50,680
We got a speed run.

509
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:53,260
We got a speed run back to the red room.

510
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:55,360
All right.

511
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:55,860
Here we go.

512
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:25,740

00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:30,900
Guys, on the website, it's called play-games.com.

00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:34,280

00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:45,380
6...

520
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:48,420

521
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:50,040

524
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:52,720
Okay, 70.

525
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:53,620
That's what it was supposed to be.

Bump, bump, bump.

529
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,600
Okay, this is easy.

530
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,020
A child can do it.

531
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:01,540
And I am that child.

532
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:03,940
Bump.

533
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,800
Wait, what about the little trumpet?

534
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:08,780
Do we not care?

535
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:10,240
What the fuck about that trumpet?

536
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:10,820
You're right.

537
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,300
Wait, it keeps going?

538
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,100
A child cannot remember this.

539
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,040
Like, why would you do this to him?

540
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:23,060
I don't know.

541
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:23,480
Bump.

542
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:28,320
Jesus Christ, this is a long one.

543
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:31,080
All right.

544
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:36,620
This would have stopped his silk song.

545
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:41,240
Okay.

546
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,180
Yeah.

547
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:56,700

548
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:57,680

00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:18,720
That's so fucking crazy.

559
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:20,740

560
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:22,320

I don't even care about the Simpsons characters.

568
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,720
I just want to fucking fuck around in Springfield.

569
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:11,400
Alright.

00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,040

Give me a sec.

578
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,460
We gotta go all the way down here.

579
00:56:54,740 --> 00:57:05,260
We gotta go outside and go outside, grab the shovel, and then dig a graveyard and grave rob, I guess.

580
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:06,380
That's fine.

581
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:08,720
Jim Davis would approve of that.

582
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:12,260
I mean, Jim, Jim is teaching us that grave robbing is okay.

583
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,480
The curse has been lifted.

584
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:18,200
I just had to go to play-games.com.

585
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,260
Bye, John.

586
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:23,500
All right, here you go.

587
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:25,100
I'll go this way.

588
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:26,860
Sour cream donuts.

589
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:28,480
Did I say sour cream donuts?

590
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:29,320
Oh, my God.

591
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:30,080
Wait, you're right.

592
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,600
That's the only pair of donuts I'm missing.

593
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:35,480
Bro, what the fuck?

594
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:37,600
Has anyone ever tried sour cream donuts?

595
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:40,320
Americans.

596
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:41,920
Am I right?

597
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:44,940
I'm not right.

598
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:48,580
Yay, I found it pretty good.

599
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:49,500
What the fuck?

600
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:50,900
Just eat chips.

601
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,540
Why would you want sour cream?

602
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:53,700
Don't just eat chips.

603
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:55,700
Like a regular person.

604
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:56,780
Alright, we did it.

605
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:58,480
What happens now?

606
00:57:58,620 --> 00:57:58,900
Oh, wait.

607
00:57:59,020 --> 00:57:59,440
Blueberry.

608
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:01,860
Wait, where the fuck is the blueberry muffins?

609
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:03,380
Wait, where?

610
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:03,700
How?

611
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:05,400
Oh!

612
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:09,020
I forgot about the...

613
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:10,200
The rats.

614
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:15,680
Yeah, but wouldn't you...

615
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,840
That's like sweet and sour, isn't it?

616
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:20,000
I guess you use savory, so...

617
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,540
Because I personally like savory.

618
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:22,080
crepes.

619
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:24,360
I mean, I do like, you know, sweet crepes, too.

620
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:29,100
Tim Hortons has, yes, but who the fuck goes to Tim Hortons for regular donuts?

621
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:31,580
I'll go to Tim Hortons for Timbits.

622
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:37,340
How is sour cream sweet?

623
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:43,080
Okay, we gotta grab the flashlight here.

624
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,840
Talk to a muffin lover?

625
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:48,220
Who likes muffins?

626
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,080
Wait, what?

627
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,180
Where do I go?

628
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:57,000
What the fuck are those muffins here?

629
00:58:58,040 --> 00:58:59,860
Okay, now I'm definitely lost.

630
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:07,520
Uh...

631
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:10,400
What the fuck?

632
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:11,380
Oh, hey!

633
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:12,620
What?

634
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:15,780
Beef's up?

635
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:17,560
Burry tales?

636
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:18,800
Stupid Cupid?

637
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,640
Garfield gets cooking?

638
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:22,540
Wait, what the fuck does any of this mean?

639
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:24,700
Like, I don't know what this means.

640
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,220
Is it supposed to be the rainbow?

641
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,700
I don't know the order of the rainbow.

642
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,280
Who the fuck knows the order of the rainbow?

643
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:36,160
Um.

644
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:40,240
Is it purple at the end?

645
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:42,920
Who the fuck knows the...

646
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:44,860
Who cares about the order of the rainbow?

647
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:46,460
Guys, rainbow flag.

648
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:49,460
Rainbow flag's in my chat right now.

649
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:52,180
Roy G.

650
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:52,700
Okay.

651
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,060
Gay?

652
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:58,080

Yellow.

659
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:08,820
Rainbow in a question mark.

01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,940

661
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:11,700

I can barely see.

668
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:03,740
I think it's alphabetical.

669
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:05,360
There's no way it's alphabetical.

670
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:06,180
There's no A.

671
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:08,020
There's no...

672
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:10,100
No, this is red.

673
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:11,920
Why is there brown in my rainbow?

674
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:14,980
How did I ruin it?

675
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:19,080
You guys said red, orange, yellow, green, blue.

676
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:22,680
Red, yellow, green.

Orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet.

01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,860
Okay, indigo, violet.

679
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:33,000

680
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,400
Is that not right?

681
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:40,320
Oh, brown, first, purple, last?

682
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:44,720
Well, clearly we're both stupid.

683
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:45,900
We're...

684
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:47,240
Clearly!

685
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:50,820
Clearly we're both fucking stupid.

686
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,000
We're both wrong.

687
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:01,940
What do you mean first?

688
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:05,300
You mean this should have been first this entire time?

689
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:07,720
Teal before...

690
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:09,520
Guys, we're learning the rainbow right now.

691
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:10,920
Teal before blue.

692
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:12,820
Teal before blue?

693
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:15,600
Okay, how do we fix this?

694
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:16,720
Okay.

695
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:22,520

01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:08,180
Wait, two of us between.

700
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:11,460
Wait, where the fuck does brown go?

701
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:14,320
Where the shit threw at the lap?

702
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:15,980
How did I throw?

703
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:20,840
What is this color?

704
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:22,740
It's brown.

705
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:24,140
Oh, this is brown.

706
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:25,340
This goes first?

707
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:28,700
Most likely.

708
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:32,280
Yellow.

709
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:33,980

01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:38,100
Purple.

713
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:39,840
Okay.

714
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:41,520
We're both fucking stupid.

715
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:43,240
Like, none of us know.

716
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:46,580
We're all wrong.

717
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:47,880
Red.

718
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:49,220
Between the...

719
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:49,440
Okay.

720
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:50,160
Between...

721
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:50,300
Okay.

722
01:03:50,980 --> 01:03:51,860
Red.

723
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:53,200
Brown.

724
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:54,060
Brown.

725
01:03:54,160 --> 01:04:02,000
Orange, yellow, green, teal, blue, purple.

726
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,200
Now look who's stupid.

727
01:04:13,060 --> 01:04:15,820
Look at that.

728
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:17,840
Now look who's stupid.

729
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:20,000
Okay, okay, I'm stupid.

730
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:21,560
I told you.

731
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:22,460
Wow.

732
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:24,960
Look at that.

733
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:27,160
There's no...

734
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:28,100
What the fuck?

735
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:29,960
What did they give us the rainbow?

736
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:32,760
Okay.

737
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:35,240
Blue before green.

738
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:37,160
Okay.

739
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:38,780
Alright.

740
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:39,880
Red.

741
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:47,060
Teal.

742
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:48,120
Green.

743
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:49,280
Orange.

744
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:50,980
Now.

745
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:51,920
Alright guys.

746
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:54,080
We're all dumb.

747
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:55,360
We're all fucking stupid.

748
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:55,920
I guess.

749
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:58,100
None of us know what the rainbow is.

750
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:09,280
None of us know what the rainbow colors are deal before it is before green.

751
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:10,960
What do you mean?

752
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,100
This is before green.

753
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:20,620
Is it alphabetical?

754
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:23,420
How the fuck is this alphabet?

755
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:33,080
All right.

756
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:36,320
Blue before purple.

757
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:38,980
Okay, now I think you guys are fucking with me.

758
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,760
Now, lady, I just...

759
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:42,080
Okay.

760
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:45,340
Start with B.

761
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:46,060
What?

762
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:47,000
Beeps up?

763
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:48,460
Okay, beeps up.

764
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:50,560
Alright, what's next?

765
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:54,620

767
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:03,160
What's after beeps up?

768
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:04,540
Furry.

769
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:05,960
Okay, A, B, C, D, F.

770
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:18,020
G, H, I, J-K-L-M-N-O-P-S.

771
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:21,620
Oh my god, it was alphabetical the entire time.

772
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:24,180
It was, why the fuck did they made it rainbow?

773
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:26,020
And then gave us brown.

774
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:30,700
I, it was, it was alphabetical the entire time.

775
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:36,360
Okay, logically.

776
01:06:36,360 --> 01:07:08,390
oh hey lineman logically i'm so hungry did you have any muffins oh there's lineman logically you would think that that'd be a rainbow because they gave us majority of the rainbow okay i got there's a vampire in here what do you mean it was a red herring it was actually a red herring they gave us all the all the rainbow colors and then brown.

777
01:07:09,430 --> 01:07:10,470
The fuck with us.

778
01:07:10,910 --> 01:07:13,670
I was like, where the fuck does the brown come from in rainbow?

779
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:16,470
Is that the light?

780
01:07:17,670 --> 01:07:19,650
It's a library.

781
01:07:20,670 --> 01:07:21,810
I don't know.

782
01:07:22,210 --> 01:07:24,690
It's somebody's fucking bookshelf.

783
01:07:25,090 --> 01:07:26,110
It's not a library.

784
01:07:26,370 --> 01:07:27,370
It's someone's house.

785
01:07:27,690 --> 01:07:33,870
I don't fucking I don't fucking coordinate my books to the fucking alphabet.

786
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:48,190
I would actually do it rainbow style Because it looks cool All right here Lyman Have a muffin Have you looked inside the fireplace yet?

787
01:07:48,590 --> 01:08:06,410
I'm looking at Yes I used to have a book I used to actually read I know it's crazy to think about guys I actually used to read And had a giant ass I had like two bookshelves filled with books Well to be fair One, like, shelf was just filled with Garfield Comics.

788
01:08:06,590 --> 01:08:10,590
But, like, look, I was a consumer of...

789
01:08:10,590 --> 01:08:13,610
I consumed every type of book, okay?

790
01:08:13,630 --> 01:08:14,810
It's not just Garfield.

791
01:08:15,210 --> 01:08:16,370
It's not just comics.

792
01:08:16,450 --> 01:08:17,910
I like all types of books.

793
01:08:18,870 --> 01:08:19,590
Oh, there you go.

794
01:08:19,770 --> 01:08:20,330
Yay!

795
01:08:21,910 --> 01:08:23,630
I did it!

796
01:08:24,010 --> 01:08:28,450
Garfield has found and eaten all of the donuts and muffins hidden inside.

797
01:08:29,570 --> 01:08:31,050
We did it, guys!

798
01:08:32,430 --> 01:08:32,990
Yay!

799
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:36,110
We did it.

800
01:08:36,170 --> 01:08:37,770
The hardest part was the rainbow.

801
01:08:38,190 --> 01:08:39,370
That was not rainbow.

802
01:08:39,810 --> 01:08:42,310
Alright, let's do the... I actually never played a second game before.

803
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:43,350
I'm going to do that.

804
01:08:44,230 --> 01:08:46,530
I didn't even realize the second game existed.

805
01:08:46,690 --> 01:08:49,950
There's no third game, though, on this website.

806
01:08:50,810 --> 01:08:51,770
I gotta know.

807
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:53,990
I gotta know what 2 is.

808
01:08:54,450 --> 01:08:56,850
How did we go back into the haunted house?

809
01:08:58,070 --> 01:08:58,790
Here we go.

810
01:08:59,790 --> 01:09:01,430
Why did I come back?

811
01:09:03,370 --> 01:09:04,010
Whoa!

812
01:09:05,270 --> 01:09:08,470

There's something here I can't see.

819
01:10:16,370 --> 01:10:21,530
Wow, I wonder if, like, you know, there's a vampire hidden in that crypt.

820
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:23,630
Alright.

821
01:10:25,130 --> 01:10:26,870

Yay!

823
01:10:29,570 --> 01:10:31,990
Why would I go this way?

824
01:10:32,150 --> 01:10:34,030
There's, like, a little piece there.

01:11:07,810 --> 01:11:08,310
Wait, you're right.

828
01:11:08,410 --> 01:11:09,590
I should be able to see in the dark.

829
01:11:12,110 --> 01:11:14,130
Wait, where the fuck could I go now?

830
01:11:15,450 --> 01:11:16,590
Where else can I go?

831
01:11:17,830 --> 01:11:18,250

01:11:23,810 --> 01:11:24,230
Okay.

835
01:11:26,010 --> 01:11:27,090
It's because it was...

836
01:11:27,090 --> 01:11:28,050
Sorry, I didn't have it.

837
01:11:28,270 --> 01:11:28,690
Like...

838
01:11:28,690 --> 01:11:29,590
What's it called?

839
01:11:30,490 --> 01:11:33,770
I didn't have, like, OCD, so it didn't matter to me.

840
01:11:35,570 --> 01:11:56,530

01:12:06,610 --> 01:12:07,250
Oh, shit.

843
01:12:07,790 --> 01:12:08,810
Well, I thought we were...

844
01:12:08,810 --> 01:12:09,030
What?

845
01:12:09,110 --> 01:12:10,050
I thought we cool.

846
01:12:13,230 --> 01:12:15,030
I thought we cool like that.

847
01:12:15,330 --> 01:12:15,650
I don't know.

848
01:12:15,730 --> 01:12:16,650
I feel like there's a...

849
01:12:16,650 --> 01:12:17,570
Oh, nice and a donut.

850
01:12:18,210 --> 01:12:18,710
I don't know.

851
01:12:18,810 --> 01:12:20,090
I feel like...

852
01:12:20,690 --> 01:12:23,050
I feel like that bear...

853
01:12:24,810 --> 01:12:27,870
I feel like the bear might not be a good bear.

854
01:12:28,290 --> 01:12:29,450
Might not be a nice bear.

855
01:12:30,990 --> 01:12:32,590
It's a cool skeleton.

856
01:12:33,690 --> 01:12:36,430
Then why did I go scary mode?

857
01:12:37,030 --> 01:12:39,470
I said I don't have to open any of the...

858
01:12:39,470 --> 01:12:42,010
Hello, do you need help spelling as well?

859
01:12:42,790 --> 01:12:45,090
You need a newspaper to swap them?

860
01:12:45,270 --> 01:12:46,630
Bro, they're just chilling.

861
01:12:47,250 --> 01:12:48,990
I thought I'm friends with the spiders.

862
01:12:50,250 --> 01:12:51,210
Oh, shit.

863
01:12:52,590 --> 01:12:53,190
I don't know.

864
01:12:53,330 --> 01:12:53,690
I thought...

865
01:12:53,690 --> 01:12:54,510
Oh, wait, there it is.

866
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:56,490
I got a bobby pin.

867
01:12:56,730 --> 01:12:58,030
What am I going to do with a bobby pin?

868
01:12:59,190 --> 01:13:00,310
I got more donuts.

869
01:13:00,770 --> 01:13:02,350
I guess I'm unlocking a safe.

870
01:13:02,350 --> 01:13:03,950
That's usually what bobby pins are for.

871
01:13:04,470 --> 01:13:04,970
Is he still there?

872
01:13:05,290 --> 01:13:05,550
Hey, John!

873
01:13:08,350 --> 01:13:09,030
Oh, nice.

874
01:13:09,170 --> 01:13:09,810
I got a newspaper.

875
01:13:09,970 --> 01:13:11,710
All right, time to swap the spotters.

876
01:13:13,190 --> 01:13:14,790
Hey, John, why is your dead girl?

877
01:13:14,850 --> 01:13:17,170
Why is your girlfriend dead and beheaded, John?

878
01:13:17,430 --> 01:13:17,710
Huh?

879
01:13:18,710 --> 01:13:19,430
Oh, no.

880
01:13:19,890 --> 01:13:21,110
We have a Dalmer here.

881
01:13:23,310 --> 01:13:24,830
All right, time to swap them.

882
01:13:34,150 --> 01:13:34,370
What?

883
01:13:34,690 --> 01:13:35,090
How?

884
01:13:35,810 --> 01:13:36,110
How?

885
01:13:37,210 --> 01:13:38,350
What are you even wrong?

886
01:13:38,610 --> 01:13:40,610
What am I supposed to- Okay, whatever.

887
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:45,100
Alright.

888
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:47,920
John has a little secret.

889
01:13:51,830 --> 01:13:54,230
What happened to- What happened to me?

890
01:13:54,590 --> 01:13:57,910
What am I supposed to- There you go.

891
01:13:59,450 --> 01:14:00,770
Yeah, I fucking knew it.

892
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:01,750
Oh no, this is bad.

893
01:14:02,150 --> 01:14:03,130
Oh, this is bad.

894
01:14:03,190 --> 01:14:04,350
I'm on turn now.

895
01:14:04,950 --> 01:14:06,690
Oh no, I keep clicking things.

896
01:14:08,710 --> 01:14:10,710
Oh no, not the bats.

897
01:14:13,450 --> 01:14:13,810
Okay.

898
01:14:16,930 --> 01:14:18,330
Oh, that's a lot of muffins.

899
01:14:19,250 --> 01:14:20,190
I don't know how they...

900
01:14:20,190 --> 01:14:21,990
Like, at this point, this is more than a box.

901
01:14:22,130 --> 01:14:23,670
Like, where did you get all these muffins?

902
01:14:25,290 --> 01:14:26,010
Okay, yay!

903
01:14:26,550 --> 01:14:27,810
Chocolate chip muffins!

904
01:14:28,310 --> 01:14:28,930
Let's go.

905
01:14:29,450 --> 01:14:32,290
I'm still at Eater, so I'm a little scared right now.

906
01:14:33,950 --> 01:14:34,490
That's right.

907
01:14:34,530 --> 01:14:35,330
You saw that?

908
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:37,390
I was gaming.

909
01:14:40,150 --> 01:14:40,930
Oh, my gosh.

910
01:14:41,010 --> 01:14:42,190
I don't know if I can click it.

911
01:14:42,210 --> 01:14:42,690
anything.

912
01:14:44,750 --> 01:14:45,930
Oh my god, I'm not gonna click it.

913
01:14:45,990 --> 01:14:47,490
No, I'm not gonna risk it.

914
01:14:47,970 --> 01:14:49,530
I need five more items.

915
01:14:49,730 --> 01:14:51,390
I'm not, I'm not doing so well.

916
01:14:51,630 --> 01:14:55,130
My heart, if I get scared four more times, my heart will explode.

917
01:14:59,330 --> 01:14:59,990
Let's see.

918
01:15:02,810 --> 01:15:05,270
Oh my god, I don't want to click anything.

919
01:15:09,110 --> 01:15:09,950
Anything else here?

920
01:15:10,890 --> 01:15:12,510
Oh no, not a button.

921

923
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:55,980
I can't click them.

924
01:15:56,860 --> 01:15:58,880
I don't want to do that again.

925
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:01,300
Oh, yay!

926
01:16:01,860 --> 01:16:03,960

Alright, let's look at it again.

959
01:19:45,590 --> 01:19:49,450

01:19:49,450 --> 01:19:50,290
Oh, wait, it's upside down.

963
01:19:52,610 --> 01:19:53,710
Because I'm like...

964
01:19:53,710 --> 01:19:58,230

Okay, now I'm scared to touch anything.

01:21:43,370 --> 01:21:47,510
Because I feel like to progress, I have to touch something.

975
01:21:50,510 --> 01:21:52,510
Oh, this is bad.

976
01:21:54,070 --> 01:21:55,230
This is very bad.

01:21:55,290 --> 01:21:56,650
Can I come out of the house?

01:21:56,790 --> 01:21:57,530

Oh, my God.

I don't know if I should click it either.

988
01:22:23,690 --> 01:22:26,130
Like, there could be a donut hidden in that area.

989
01:22:26,410 --> 01:22:28,290

1006
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:41,860
A spooky scary.

1007
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:45,360
Like, anything I could click could be dangerous.

1008
01:23:48,740 --> 01:23:51,940
Okay, I feel like all of these are, like, actually dangerous.

1009
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:55,380
I don't know.

1010
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:59,500
They could all just fucking get up and kill me.

1011
01:24:00,220 --> 01:24:01,140
Nothing in the bear.

1012
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:02,400
Who are you, Christopher?

1013
01:24:02,900 --> 01:24:03,340
Alright.

1014
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,140
Are you willing to bet your cat?

1015
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:07,400
Count on this, Christopher?

1016
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:09,520
Are you ready to the bet?

1017
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:11,000
I will ban you.

1018
01:24:14,540 --> 01:24:15,560
All right, goodbye.

1019
01:24:19,660 --> 01:24:21,280
Where are you, Christopher?

1020
01:24:22,460 --> 01:24:23,660
That's right.

1021
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:26,680
24 hours.

1022
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:28,780
I hope you think about your actions.

1023
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:29,620
I...

1024
01:24:35,020 --> 01:24:35,620
That's right.

1025
01:24:35,620 --> 01:24:36,140
That's right.

1026
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:37,260
That's fucking right.

1027
01:24:38,460 --> 01:24:40,020
Trying to send me the ER.

1028
01:24:41,540 --> 01:24:43,620
He said nothing there.

1029
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:44,980
Yeah.

1030
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:50,200
That's right.

1031
01:24:50,620 --> 01:24:52,260
No one fucks with me.

1032
01:24:53,100 --> 01:24:53,280
Alright.

1033
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:56,320
That's right.

1034
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:57,360
I took him out back.

1035
01:24:57,960 --> 01:24:59,200
And he's not home anymore.

1036
01:25:05,950 --> 01:25:06,850
That's right.

1037
01:25:07,330 --> 01:25:09,190
I call the DSA on him.

1038
01:25:13,350 --> 01:25:14,830
He's got a way in the...

1039
01:25:14,830 --> 01:25:17,070
He's got a way at the airport now.

1040
01:25:18,330 --> 01:25:18,610
That's right.

1041
01:25:18,710 --> 01:25:20,110
I ain't babysitting you anymore.

1042
01:25:20,430 --> 01:25:23,250
We're sending you back to your original dokeyverse.

1043
01:25:26,590 --> 01:25:33,110
I don't know where to go.

1044
01:25:33,290 --> 01:25:34,210
I'm scared.

1045
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:36,090
I'm so scared.

1046
01:25:37,130 --> 01:25:39,830
I need to find three more donuts.

1047
01:25:42,510 --> 01:25:43,670
Oh, wait, what?

1048
01:25:44,910 --> 01:25:46,570
When did this open?

1049
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:47,190
Oh, hey.

1050
01:25:49,910 --> 01:25:50,950
Oh, it's...

1051
01:25:50,950 --> 01:25:51,950
It's whack-a-mice.

1052
01:25:54,930 --> 01:25:55,630
Oh, shit.

1053
01:25:56,130 --> 01:25:57,030
Oh, I'm supposed to...

1054
01:25:57,030 --> 01:25:59,990
Oh, I'm supposed to whack the muffins.

1055
01:26:01,890 --> 01:26:03,210
Sorry, whack-a-muffin.

1056
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:09,180
I was so confused.

1057
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:10,460
I was like, wait, what the fuck?

1058
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:12,400
How the fuck up?

1059
01:26:12,420 --> 01:26:13,180
I got him.

1060
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:17,560
Yay!

1061
01:26:18,620 --> 01:26:19,700
Okay, we need...

1062
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:24,700
Oh my god, we still need, like...

1063
01:26:24,700 --> 01:26:26,400
We still need two more.

1064
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:28,900
How do we get to the other two?

1065
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:32,700
Is there any...

1066
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:34,440
Phone a friend.

1067
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:37,160
Phone a chat.

1068
01:26:38,980 --> 01:26:39,940
What do I do?

1069
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:41,840
How do I get to the bookshelf?

1070
01:26:46,530 --> 01:26:48,470
The bookshelves locked.

1071
01:26:51,990 --> 01:26:53,450
How do I get in?

1072
01:26:57,790 --> 01:26:58,410
No, I did.

1073
01:26:58,550 --> 01:26:59,270
I picked the lock.

1074
01:26:59,430 --> 01:27:00,190
It was for Orson.

1075
01:27:04,940 --> 01:27:06,780
I can't even go outside.

1076
01:27:10,450 --> 01:27:10,790
See?

1077
01:27:11,890 --> 01:27:12,950
It's just there.

1078
01:27:13,150 --> 01:27:13,550
I don't know.

1079
01:27:13,630 --> 01:27:14,430
It's just existing.

1080
01:27:15,350 --> 01:27:16,390
I can't open these.

1081
01:27:16,430 --> 01:27:18,150
I feel like there'd be stuff here.

1082
01:27:19,910 --> 01:27:20,850
I don't know.

1083
01:27:20,970 --> 01:27:22,430
I don't trust these cabinets.

1084
01:27:24,350 --> 01:27:29,130

1087
01:28:32,150 --> 01:28:33,090
Oh, you're so lucky.

1088
01:28:33,710 --> 01:28:34,030
You're so...

1089
01:28:34,030 --> 01:28:34,790
Oh, no!

1090
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:40,680
Okay, that's fine.

1091
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:44,420
I know how to do puzzles.

1092
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:48,880
It's like here.

1093
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:50,820
Donuts.

1094
01:28:53,140 --> 01:28:54,320
I don't fucking know where this...

1095
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:55,040
Oh, it goes here.

1096
01:28:58,180 --> 01:29:02,560
Okay, and then piece it together.

1097
01:29:04,020 --> 01:29:05,620
Yeah, I think the first one was better.

1098
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:09,240
I like the first one more than the second one.

1099
01:29:09,640 --> 01:29:11,300
We just need assorted donuts now.

1100
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:12,040
Alright.

1101
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:14,680
How do we get the assorted donuts?

1102
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:24,320
I feel like the assorted donuts is in that bookshelf.

1103
01:29:24,380 --> 01:29:25,820
It's in the rainbow bookshelf.

1104
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:30,700
Trey in the dining room?

1105
01:29:30,940 --> 01:29:31,320
Is this?

1106
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:34,040
Oh my god, it was here all along?

1107
01:29:34,940 --> 01:29:35,120
Oh!

1108
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:37,260
Oh no.

1109
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:39,760
It's over here.

1110
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:42,780
Yay!

1111
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:50,640
Okay, nice.

1112
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:51,280
We did it again.

1113
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:53,200
That's right, I'm winning.

1114
01:29:56,940 --> 01:29:58,720
If I blink, I fuck up.

1115
01:29:59,320 --> 01:29:59,800
Yay!

1116
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:01,920
Best?

1117
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:02,480
No.

1118
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:03,340
No.

1119
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:04,880
Yay!

1120
01:30:06,020 --> 01:30:07,080
I did it!

1121
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:07,580
Oh, wait.

1122
01:30:08,100 --> 01:30:09,220
Rainbow, Rainbow Library.

1123
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:10,600
Rainbow Shelf.

1124
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:14,220
Oh, my God.

1125
01:30:14,380 --> 01:30:14,880
It's the exit.

1126
01:30:16,460 --> 01:30:16,940
Oh, my God.

1127
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:17,820
It's a maze.

1128
01:30:18,260 --> 01:30:19,000
Always go right.

1129
01:30:20,980 --> 01:30:21,540
Okay.

1130
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:27,060
Okay, no.

1131
01:30:27,580 --> 01:30:28,600
Always go left.

1132
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:30,980
I meant...

1133
01:30:30,980 --> 01:30:32,520
I meant left, guys.

1134
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:34,560
Always go left.

1135
01:30:38,230 --> 01:30:38,870
And this way.

1136
01:30:42,090 --> 01:30:43,630
And then we go this way.

1137
01:30:46,630 --> 01:30:47,470
Oh, no.

1138
01:30:48,330 --> 01:30:48,930
Oh, no.

1139
01:30:49,010 --> 01:30:50,010
I don't like this.

1140
01:30:51,130 --> 01:30:54,170
Why is there so much more to this maze?

1141
01:30:55,830 --> 01:30:57,550
When does it end?

1142
01:31:02,950 --> 01:31:07,750
I swear to you guys, this is dead and I have to backtrack my way back here.

1143
01:31:08,830 --> 01:31:10,490
I went through so...

1144
01:31:12,070 --> 01:31:14,650
Hey Furball, I know the secret code.

1145
01:31:14,830 --> 01:31:15,850
But you have to hit me again.

1146
01:31:16,350 --> 01:31:17,670
Not me, mouse, breath.

1147
01:31:17,790 --> 01:31:18,750
The other one.

1148
01:31:19,870 --> 01:31:26,190
The secret code is 8, 4, 2, 9.

1149
01:31:30,050 --> 01:31:30,610
9.

1150
01:31:30,850 --> 01:31:32,790
Okay, 8, 4, 2, 9, 9.

1151
01:31:33,250 --> 01:31:33,970
That's easy.

1152
01:31:36,890 --> 01:31:39,870
8, 4, 2, 9.

1153
01:31:41,150 --> 01:31:41,790
9.

1154
01:31:42,110 --> 01:31:42,950
Oh, that's easy.

1155
01:31:43,330 --> 01:31:44,510
He wasn't gonna fuck with me.

1156
01:31:47,070 --> 01:31:47,550
Yay!

1157
01:31:50,490 --> 01:31:52,190
I did it!

1158
01:31:53,110 --> 01:31:54,010
What did I get?

1159
01:31:58,290 --> 01:32:00,590
I got a screen saver.

1160
01:32:01,630 --> 01:32:04,110
Does Windows 11 even have screen?

1161
01:32:05,630 --> 01:32:08,750
Oh my oh my god, that's throwback.

1162
01:32:08,910 --> 01:32:10,450
Oh my god, I miss screen savers.

1163
01:32:10,790 --> 01:32:15,750
Remember I, wait, can I actually download that?

1164
01:32:20,620 --> 01:32:21,580
Absolutely nothing.

1165
01:32:22,380 --> 01:32:24,540
I'll see if I can download this.

1166
01:32:25,700 --> 01:32:27,520
Oh, Microsoft Windows.

1167
01:32:29,100 --> 01:32:32,340
Oh, it actually doesn't let you download anything.

1168
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:33,560
Wait, what game is this?

1169
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:37,920
Unfortunately, it did not let me download a screen saver.

1170
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:41,140
But then I saw this game and I was like, wait, I feel this.

1171
01:32:43,140 --> 01:32:44,500
Wait, this resonates with me.

01:33:51,570 --> 01:33:52,850
Now I'm forever...

1178
01:33:52,850 --> 01:33:54,830
What a lovely picture to have.

1179
01:33:55,290 --> 01:33:55,590

Okay.

1183
01:34:02,210 --> 01:34:03,230
That's not right.

1184
01:34:03,670 --> 01:34:04,950

01:36:52,540 --> 01:36:53,720

1249
01:37:13,350 --> 01:37:14,430

Okay, God.

1261
01:37:45,130 --> 01:37:47,230

1262
01:37:47,610 --> 01:37:49,130
Because I don't have...

1263
01:37:49,130 --> 01:37:50,590

1264
01:37:50,590 --> 01:37:51,650

1270
01:37:59,650 --> 01:38:01,870
We beat every version of Sands.

1271
01:38:02,950 --> 01:38:05,410
Garfield Sands is no different.

1272
01:38:10,170 --> 01:38:11,510

01:38:29,610 --> 01:38:32,130

01:44:22,870 --> 01:44:25,810
It's just every other fucking thing he puts me through.

1370
01:44:26,690 --> 01:44:28,250
Just dodge, bro.

1371
01:44:29,110 --> 01:44:30,470
Just dodge.

1372
01:44:33,990 --> 01:44:34,550
Oh.

1373
01:44:35,430 --> 01:44:36,870
Oh no, where's my pipe?

1374
01:44:37,910 --> 01:44:40,790
Where is my pipe?

1375
01:44:41,710 --> 01:44:44,510
Like, I can dodge this, but then he goes, God, fear!

1376
01:44:57,220 --> 01:44:59,640
I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna shank him.

1377
01:45:00,460 --> 01:45:01,380
Oh, God, why did I?

1378
01:45:01,660 --> 01:45:02,240
I'm sorry.

1379
01:45:20,850 --> 01:45:21,970
God, fear!

1380
01:45:22,810 --> 01:45:23,630
Just pray.

1381
01:45:24,510 --> 01:45:25,230
Nirmal, please.

1382
01:45:27,310 --> 01:45:28,630
Oh, thank God.

1383
01:45:28,870 --> 01:45:30,810
Nirmal actually did something.

1384
01:45:32,330 --> 01:45:33,610
He was paralyzed.

1385
01:45:34,250 --> 01:45:35,690
Oh, my God, he's paralyzed.

1386
01:45:36,810 --> 01:45:37,910
I should have prayed.

1387
01:45:44,620 --> 01:45:45,120
Oh my god.

1388
01:45:45,380 --> 01:45:46,940
It does more than just a rock.

1389
01:45:47,720 --> 01:45:48,920
I thought that was it.

1390
01:45:52,180 --> 01:45:52,700
Are you?

1391
01:45:52,700 --> 01:45:54,280
Are you kidding me?

1392
01:45:55,320 --> 01:45:56,840
That was so free.

1393
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:00,000
Maybe?

1394
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:00,780
Nirmal.

1395
01:46:01,120 --> 01:46:02,140
Please keep praying.

1396
01:46:04,240 --> 01:46:05,660
Oh my god.

1397
01:46:05,780 --> 01:46:06,940
Nirmal, just keep praying.

1398
01:46:07,140 --> 01:46:07,480
Oh no.

1399
01:46:08,600 --> 01:46:09,120
Where?

1400
01:46:09,140 --> 01:46:11,840
Where is my fight?

1401
01:46:18,870 --> 01:46:19,210
Oh, God.

1402
01:46:20,130 --> 01:46:20,730
That was an accident.

1403
01:46:26,530 --> 01:46:28,150
At the end of the side, yeah.

1404
01:46:29,850 --> 01:46:31,950
The power of fear.

1405
01:46:33,730 --> 01:46:33,930
All right.

1406
01:46:34,810 --> 01:46:35,990
No, no, no.

1407
01:46:36,090 --> 01:46:37,070
This is so bullshit.

1408
01:46:37,330 --> 01:46:38,610
This is so bullshit.

1409
01:46:42,250 --> 01:46:42,770
Okay.

1410
01:46:43,410 --> 01:46:44,490
I gotta pray.

1411
01:46:44,690 --> 01:46:45,410
Nirmal will keep praying.

1412
01:46:45,430 --> 01:46:48,170

Oh, my God.

1417
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:44,920
Oh, I can't.

It might not be like a plan, guys.

1423
01:47:57,440 --> 01:47:58,640
Might not be it.

1424
01:47:58,760 --> 01:47:59,360
I might not.

1425
01:47:59,660 --> 01:48:01,160
Maybe I should not rely on.

1426
01:48:01,380 --> 01:48:03,140
Wait, what if one more time?

1427
01:48:03,820 --> 01:48:05,140

Okay.

They gave me a freebie here.

1484
01:53:14,260 --> 01:53:15,120
Do I risk it?

1485
01:53:15,320 --> 01:53:16,580
Do I risk it with Nirmah?

1486
01:53:17,660 --> 01:53:20,940
Do I trust in the almighty Nirmah?

1487
01:53:26,070 --> 01:53:27,250
Oh, my God.

01:53:30,050 --> 01:53:31,590

01:54:39,710 --> 01:54:41,950

What do you mean?

1498
01:54:43,990 --> 01:54:45,390

It's fine.

1515
01:55:46,890 --> 01:55:47,830
We gave us an OD.

1516
01:55:52,900 --> 01:55:53,980
Cha-cha!

1517
01:55:54,920 --> 01:55:55,460

Alright.

1522
01:56:03,380 --> 01:56:04,740

1524
01:56:07,900 --> 01:56:10,960
I don't know how to... I don't know how to do this one.

1525
01:56:12,060 --> 01:56:13,660
This is actually the worst one.

1526
01:56:16,360 --> 01:56:18,680
The Pokee Blasters are the worst one.

1527
01:56:19,600 --> 01:56:21,040

Why does he do this to me?

1533
01:57:40,210 --> 01:57:43,530
Why does Satisfield do this to me?

1534
01:57:44,730 --> 01:57:44,790
Oh!

1535
01:57:48,290 --> 01:57:51,950

It's not fair.

1538
01:57:55,590 --> 01:57:56,990
It's not fair.

1539
01:58:00,290 --> 01:58:03,290
Where is my butt?

1540
01:58:11,120 --> 01:58:11,920
Okay.

1541
01:58:18,170 --> 01:58:18,970

Okay.

1545
01:58:35,030 --> 01:58:35,790
Am I facing?

1546
01:58:36,150 --> 01:58:36,510
No!

1547
01:58:36,790 --> 01:58:38,070
Not the Pokeblasters!

1548
01:58:38,530 --> 01:58:38,830

1549
01:58:39,090 --> 01:58:40,670
Anything with the Pokeblasters!

1550
01:58:41,150 --> 01:58:41,510
Oh!

1551
01:58:41,870 --> 01:58:42,150
Oh!

1552
01:58:50,980 --> 01:58:52,180
It's always...

1553
01:58:52,580 --> 01:58:54,280
It's always the Pokeblasters.

1554
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:56,120
If I...

1555
01:58:56,120 --> 01:58:57,280
Oh my god.

1556
01:58:59,280 --> 01:59:01,420
Oh my god!

1557
01:59:02,260 --> 01:59:02,540
Ah!

1558
01:59:03,600 --> 01:59:04,160
Okay.

1559
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:05,940
At least I remember the Odies.

1560
01:59:07,660 --> 01:59:14,500
The fact that I don't even get, like, you know, like, you know, like, Sands, at least he gives you, like, moments to, like, to chill.

1561
01:59:14,800 --> 01:59:15,400
He doesn't.

1562
01:59:15,500 --> 01:59:15,940
He doesn't.

1563
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:17,240
Sandsfield does not care.

1564
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:20,420
I'll never escape Monday.

1565
01:59:21,880 --> 01:59:24,100
I'm so scared of Phase 2.

1566
01:59:27,460 --> 01:59:30,200
Like, there's no way to dodge any of this!

1567
01:59:31,700 --> 01:59:33,040
It's not me!

1568
01:59:33,700 --> 01:59:35,320
There's no fucking way!

1569
01:59:40,380 --> 01:59:40,700
Oh!

1570
01:59:48,950 --> 01:59:50,370
Oh, my god.

1571
01:59:51,530 --> 01:59:52,470
Have you just...

1572
01:59:52,470 --> 01:59:54,130
Have you just tried not getting it?

1573
01:59:54,270 --> 01:59:55,210
Oh, wow, guys.

1574
01:59:55,210 --> 01:59:55,910
This is crazy.

1575
01:59:56,030 --> 01:59:57,130
What a crazy idea.

1576
01:59:57,630 --> 01:59:58,250
Wow!

1577
01:59:59,510 --> 02:00:01,190
Oh, my god.

1578
02:00:01,330 --> 02:00:01,670
No.

1579
02:00:08,970 --> 02:00:11,610
That's like the most HP I've ever got out of that.

1580
02:00:12,450 --> 02:00:13,750
I don't think I've ever had.

1581
02:00:14,610 --> 02:00:15,330
That's literally...

1582
02:00:16,250 --> 02:00:17,150
That's crazy.

1583
02:00:17,870 --> 02:00:20,190
Oh my god.

1584
02:00:22,710 --> 02:00:23,890
Alright, you're my lasagna.

1585
02:00:27,070 --> 02:00:28,190
I'm yam-yam-yam-yam.

1586
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:34,980
I think I dodged the beams, dude.

1587
02:00:35,500 --> 02:00:36,840
Oh shit, really?

1588
02:00:37,420 --> 02:00:38,200
Oh my god.

1589
02:00:38,900 --> 02:00:39,240
No!

1590
02:00:45,320 --> 02:00:46,540
What is that?

1591
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:52,560
Oh my god.

1592
02:00:54,380 --> 02:00:57,320
Where is my fight?

1593
02:01:08,340 --> 02:01:09,080
I looked at chat.

1594
02:01:09,360 --> 02:01:09,920
Oh fuck!

1595
02:01:10,260 --> 02:01:10,920
Oh fuck!

1596
02:01:15,670 --> 02:01:17,490
Guys, don't look at chat.

1597
02:01:17,990 --> 02:01:20,110
It might be a bad thing to do.

1598
02:01:20,630 --> 02:01:21,470
What is that?

1599
02:01:24,950 --> 02:01:25,670
Okay.

1600
02:01:27,370 --> 02:01:28,690
I think I eat my spaghetti.

1601
02:01:33,890 --> 02:01:35,110
Okay, I'm 40 HP.

1602
02:01:35,990 --> 02:01:36,830
Oh my god.

1603
02:01:37,350 --> 02:01:38,070
Not him again.

1604
02:01:38,530 --> 02:01:41,490
Where is my pipe?

1605
02:01:54,250 --> 02:01:55,610
Oh my god.

1606
02:01:56,030 --> 02:01:58,250
Guys, I don't think I can heal anymore.

1607
02:01:58,950 --> 02:02:00,450
If I heal, it's over.

1608
02:02:05,250 --> 02:02:06,630
Every time.

1609
02:02:07,630 --> 02:02:10,770
It's always the boogie blaster.

1610
02:02:11,350 --> 02:02:13,970
It's always the boogie blaster.

1611
02:02:14,770 --> 02:02:16,630
Every fucking time.

1612
02:02:16,950 --> 02:02:19,970
I need the RNG to give me five ODs in a row.

1613
02:02:20,410 --> 02:02:22,550
That's the only way I can win this.

1614
02:02:24,250 --> 02:02:31,430
The OD guys must look upon me and give me five ODs in a row.

1615
02:02:31,890 --> 02:02:34,510
It's actually like the most balanced game.

1616
02:02:35,290 --> 02:02:35,650
Like...

1617
02:02:38,770 --> 02:02:42,270
Where is my fight?

1618
02:02:51,990 --> 02:02:52,950
Okay,

1619
02:02:56,470 --> 02:02:58,090
you can take half my HP, I guess.

1620
02:02:58,610 --> 02:02:59,570
I guess.

1621
02:03:00,570 --> 02:03:03,350
Oh, I leave me alone.

1622
02:03:04,490 --> 02:03:04,910
Please.

1623
02:03:08,250 --> 02:03:10,330
Oh, my God.

1624
02:03:12,510 --> 02:03:14,150
Where is...

1625
02:03:14,170 --> 02:03:15,770
Bye-bye

1626
02:03:20,970 --> 02:03:29,370
Okay, this one this one is not as bad I wish I would get this more often this and OD

02:03:32,710 --> 02:03:50,790

1630
02:04:02,470 --> 02:04:04,330
Oh my god, he's been kicking for so long.

1631
02:04:06,790 --> 02:04:07,690
Oh my god, please.

1632
02:04:08,230 --> 02:04:08,990
Can you go to sleep?

1633
02:04:09,130 --> 02:04:09,410
No!

1634
02:04:10,050 --> 02:04:10,790
Where...

1635
02:04:10,790 --> 02:04:13,850
Where is my pipe?

1636
02:04:15,910 --> 02:04:18,450
Bring in the Funky Blasters!

1637
02:04:19,450 --> 02:04:19,930
Please!

1638
02:04:20,430 --> 02:04:20,930
Please!

1639
02:04:21,170 --> 02:04:22,690
Not the Funky Blasters!

1640
02:04:22,950 --> 02:04:23,450
Hey!

1641
02:04:26,390 --> 02:04:27,530

02:04:28,170 --> 02:04:30,550

Alright, I pray to Nirmal.

1645
02:04:41,870 --> 02:04:43,730

1646

Oh, oh, the boogie blasters are here.

02:13:00,920 --> 02:13:02,500
Is my fight.

1730
02:13:15,690 --> 02:13:16,750
Oh, my God.

1731
02:13:16,850 --> 02:13:19,610
Okay, okay, I sort of figured out the pattern for that.

1732
02:13:19,970 --> 02:13:21,550
I sort of, I think I figured it out.

1733
02:13:26,150 --> 02:13:26,730
Woo!

1734
02:13:27,910 --> 02:13:29,510
Oh, whoop, it's fine, it's fine.

1735
02:13:29,750 --> 02:13:30,210
It's just a little.

1736
02:13:30,290 --> 02:13:31,650
I just chipped my toe.

1737
02:13:33,510 --> 02:13:34,390
It's chipped my toe.

1738
02:13:39,330 --> 02:13:39,910
It's okay.

1739
02:13:45,690 --> 02:13:47,990
It's always the boogie blasters.

1740
02:13:48,830 --> 02:13:50,370
It's always the boogie blasters.

1741
02:13:50,990 --> 02:13:51,910
It's always him.

1742
02:13:52,230 --> 02:13:53,230
It's always him.

1743
02:13:53,610 --> 02:13:55,610
It's never been anything else.

1744
02:14:06,670 --> 02:14:07,490
It's okay.

1745
02:14:07,850 --> 02:14:08,510
It's okay.

1746
02:14:11,090 --> 02:14:11,870
I'm okay.

1747
02:14:13,290 --> 02:14:14,010
I'm okay.

1748
02:14:19,780 --> 02:14:20,340
Center.

1749
02:14:23,940 --> 02:14:26,580
The pookster senses are guys.

1750
02:14:33,610 --> 02:14:35,970
Okay, please just give me five ODs.

1751
02:14:36,390 --> 02:14:37,170
That's all I want.

1752
02:14:37,290 --> 02:14:38,710
Five ODs in a row.

1753
02:14:39,670 --> 02:14:41,210
Just give me that RNG.

1754
02:14:42,750 --> 02:14:44,190
That's all I want.

1755
02:14:44,810 --> 02:14:50,030
Oh, oh, where is my pipe?

1756
02:14:52,010 --> 02:14:53,030
Where is it?

1757
02:14:53,490 --> 02:14:54,590
Where is your pipe?

1758
02:14:54,970 --> 02:14:57,010
Why do you keep losing your pipe, John?

1759
02:15:03,110 --> 02:15:05,290
Oh my gosh.

1760
02:15:19,490 --> 02:15:20,290
Lasagna.

1761
02:15:23,130 --> 02:15:24,510
Where's the pipe, John?

1762
02:15:24,790 --> 02:15:25,710
Where is it?

1763
02:15:26,450 --> 02:15:32,810

1764
02:15:43,690 --> 02:16:10,590

1765
02:16:14,070 --> 02:16:17,090
And now all the jokies will remember the fight.

1766
02:16:29,670 --> 02:16:30,390
Okay.

1767
02:16:30,970 --> 02:16:31,710
It's sleep time.

1768
02:16:32,670 --> 02:16:33,670
Sheep, sheep, sheep.

1769
02:17:22,380 --> 02:17:25,580
Where is my fight?

1770
02:17:48,570 --> 02:17:51,710
Where did the pipe go, Josh?

1771
02:17:52,590 --> 02:17:54,690
Where did it go?

1772
02:17:56,990 --> 02:17:59,590
Where did the little pipe go?

1773
02:18:10,730 --> 02:18:12,910
I'd almost had it.

1774
02:18:13,610 --> 02:18:17,070
It was... it was right there.

1775
02:18:20,190 --> 02:18:23,970
It was... it was right there.

1776
02:18:24,690 --> 02:18:27,450
It was... it was right there.

1777
02:18:28,530 --> 02:18:32,750
I almost had it!

1778
02:18:36,370 --> 02:18:39,330
I don't understand!

1779
02:18:46,520 --> 02:18:56,140

1781
02:19:19,820 --> 02:19:20,920
Oh, my...

1782
02:19:22,220 --> 02:19:25,160
Where is my pipe?

1783
02:19:30,800 --> 02:19:32,120
Where is it?

1784
02:19:32,780 --> 02:19:34,320
Where could my pipe be?

1785
02:19:39,580 --> 02:19:43,260
Guys, we're gonna go in there with 31 HP.

1786
02:19:43,420 --> 02:19:44,400
Oh, it's getting lower.

1787
02:19:55,610 --> 02:19:56,370
It's...

1788
02:19:56,370 --> 02:19:57,410
Why is

1789
02:20:01,180 --> 02:20:02,120
it...

1790
02:20:02,120 --> 02:20:03,340
Wait, what?

1791
02:20:12,560 --> 02:20:14,920
Oh my god, I'm just gonna pray.

1792
02:20:15,160 --> 02:20:16,720
There's no hope anymore.

1793
02:20:19,620 --> 02:20:21,900
Sparkles with sand spilling and repeals refreshed.

1794
02:20:22,200 --> 02:20:22,720
Oh, okay.

1795
02:20:22,840 --> 02:20:24,440
Oh, he got HP too.

1796
02:20:25,100 --> 02:20:25,940
That's cool.

1797
02:20:26,540 --> 02:20:27,280
Equality, am I right?

1798
02:20:30,360 --> 02:20:34,440
They knew after I finally understood the assignment.

1799
02:20:34,860 --> 02:20:37,380
Oh, they sent it to the other side.

1800
02:20:43,660 --> 02:20:47,600
I saw the sheep one time and I never saw him again.

1801
02:20:48,680 --> 02:20:50,940
They, like, took the sheep to the back of the farm.

1802
02:21:03,490 --> 02:21:04,690
Let's just put it.

1803
02:21:05,150 --> 02:21:06,350
It is not the run.

1804
02:21:06,750 --> 02:21:07,530
I already know.

1805
02:21:08,110 --> 02:21:10,510
I already know it was not the run.

1806
02:21:10,790 --> 02:21:11,830
I'm very freaking...

1807
02:21:11,830 --> 02:21:12,470
I knew.

1808
02:21:12,630 --> 02:21:14,590
I knew it wasn't the run.

1809
02:21:14,690 --> 02:21:16,150
We couldn't do that one.

1810
02:21:20,210 --> 02:21:29,390

Oh no.

1814
02:22:40,590 --> 02:22:42,290
Karaoke is for winners.

1815
02:22:48,170 --> 02:22:50,850
Only winners get karaoke.

1816
02:22:52,430 --> 02:22:52,490
Oh.

1817
02:22:54,290 --> 02:22:57,550
The blue flag is this, you guys.

1818
02:23:02,820 --> 02:23:04,820
We can do this.

1819
02:23:05,340 --> 02:23:06,220
Oh my, stop!

1820
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:09,800
I don't want to fight your fight!

1821
02:23:13,820 --> 02:23:15,700
Please, please!

1822
02:23:16,400 --> 02:23:19,220
There's other fucking games!

1823
02:23:25,010 --> 02:23:25,210
Okay.

1824
02:23:29,100 --> 02:23:33,120
Please stop making your cat smoke!

1825
02:23:39,160 --> 02:23:39,480
Okay.

1826
02:23:40,660 --> 02:23:43,980
Why couldn't he just give me seven ODs in a row?

1827
02:23:44,660 --> 02:23:45,700
I don't understand.

1828
02:23:45,720 --> 02:24:21,420
understand why oops okay I just need seven odys just just seven odys and then and then the run the run won't be dead okay and then we eat lasagna after this oh my god if I live I can live.

1829
02:24:23,660 --> 02:24:24,340
Okay.

1830
02:24:24,820 --> 02:24:26,280
Okay, we just still need lasagna.

1831
02:24:28,540 --> 02:24:30,760
No, Quail, don't say that.

1832
02:24:31,040 --> 02:24:33,320
Don't say that, Quail.

1833
02:24:35,460 --> 02:24:36,360
Oh, my God.

1834
02:24:36,540 --> 02:24:37,200
Look what you did.

1835
02:24:37,520 --> 02:24:38,760
Look what you did.

1836
02:24:40,180 --> 02:24:42,520
You threw me off my group.

1837
02:24:43,600 --> 02:24:45,900
You threw me off my group.

1838
02:24:52,570 --> 02:24:53,250
Oh.

1839
02:24:53,950 --> 02:24:55,950
But yeah, I have to eat spaghetti.

1840
02:25:06,240 --> 02:25:06,460
Okay.

1841
02:25:14,810 --> 02:25:15,770
Oh my god.

1842
02:25:16,550 --> 02:25:17,150
Oh my god.

1843
02:25:17,250 --> 02:25:19,890
Why did they send me 20 ODs in a row?

1844
02:25:20,470 --> 02:25:21,650
Like, like...

1845
02:25:21,650 --> 02:25:22,390
I mean, I want...

1846
02:25:22,390 --> 02:25:23,090
No, that's good.

1847
02:25:23,170 --> 02:25:24,370
That's good that he did.

1848
02:25:24,530 --> 02:25:24,770
Okay.

1849
02:25:26,110 --> 02:25:26,510
Okay.

1850
02:25:51,340 --> 02:25:53,020
Guys, I'm not strong enough.

1851
02:25:54,600 --> 02:25:56,960
Because I don't think I'm strong enough.

1852
02:25:59,520 --> 02:26:01,540
Because I don't know.

1853
02:26:02,140 --> 02:26:07,480
I don't, I don't know if I can keep going anymore.

1854
02:26:08,480 --> 02:26:09,720
I don't know.

1855
02:26:14,130 --> 02:26:15,570
There's a phase three.

1856
02:26:16,370 --> 02:26:18,110
There's a phase three.

1857
02:26:20,190 --> 02:26:23,030
What do you mean there's a phase three?

1858
02:26:38,660 --> 02:26:41,260
You get worse?

1859
02:26:43,680 --> 02:26:47,860
Where is my fight?

1860
02:26:52,030 --> 02:26:54,770
Okay, I'll do one more.

1861
02:26:55,590 --> 02:26:56,630
I'll do one more.

1862
02:26:57,170 --> 02:27:01,150
And then this deserves its own stream at this point.

1863
02:27:01,470 --> 02:27:03,210
This deserves its own stream.

1864
02:27:04,190 --> 02:27:07,590
What the fuck does time segment even mean?

1865
02:27:09,870 --> 02:27:14,570
This is harder than the sands, but 100%.

1866
02:27:14,570 --> 02:27:17,170
I believe this is harder.

1867
02:27:20,650 --> 02:27:22,210
Oh my god.

1868
02:27:23,850 --> 02:27:27,070
Where is my fight?

1869
02:27:40,060 --> 02:27:44,080
Oh god, he took up so much of my HP.

1870
02:27:47,920 --> 02:27:49,280
Oh my god.

1871
02:27:49,300 --> 02:27:53,920
God, someone save me.

1872
02:27:56,780 --> 02:27:59,600
Okay, if I live through this, I'll eat a lasagna.

1873
02:28:08,890 --> 02:28:09,570
Lasagna.

1874
02:28:12,890 --> 02:28:15,210
I need a pipe now.

1875
02:28:18,730 --> 02:28:20,370
Oh my God.

1876
02:28:22,650 --> 02:28:24,790
This is so bullshit.

1877
02:28:25,490 --> 02:28:27,270
This is such a bullshit.

1878
02:28:27,410 --> 02:28:27,990
attack.

1879
02:28:34,350 --> 02:28:35,810
This is harder than Sans.

1880
02:28:35,970 --> 02:28:37,130
This is harder.

1881
02:28:37,430 --> 02:28:40,970
This is 100% harder than this actual Sans fight.

1882
02:28:41,850 --> 02:28:42,530
Day back.

1883
02:28:43,830 --> 02:28:45,530
Like, oh my god.

1884
02:28:45,830 --> 02:28:48,070
The gastric plaster was easier.

1885
02:28:48,550 --> 02:28:49,110
The poop.

1886
02:28:50,130 --> 02:28:50,690
Oh my.

1887
02:28:50,810 --> 02:28:51,610
I'm done.

1888
02:28:52,030 --> 02:28:52,930
I'm done.

1889
02:28:53,850 --> 02:28:55,050
I'm done.

1890
02:28:56,310 --> 02:28:57,830
I can't.

1891
02:28:58,250 --> 02:28:59,290
I can't.

1892
02:28:59,470 --> 02:28:59,610
I can't.

1893
02:28:59,610 --> 02:29:32,390
I'm going fucking crazy I can't keep going I'm not strong enough I don't want to find the pipe no more I can't keep trying to find the pipe I can't oh my god why would he Why would he do this to me?

1894
02:29:33,750 --> 02:29:35,870
Why would he do this?

1895
02:29:38,890 --> 02:29:42,530
Oh, where is my pipe?

1896
02:29:46,430 --> 02:29:48,850
Now we'll never know.

1897
02:29:50,010 --> 02:29:51,910
Just give him the pipe.

1898
02:29:52,850 --> 02:29:53,750
Okay, one more.

1899
02:29:54,010 --> 02:29:55,290
I'll do one more.

1900
02:29:55,890 --> 02:29:56,530
One more.

1901
02:29:57,790 --> 02:29:59,070
I'll pray to Nirmal.

1902
02:29:59,530 --> 02:30:00,450
Nirmal, please.

1903
02:30:00,470 --> 02:30:01,550
help me.

1904
02:30:02,150 --> 02:30:03,090
Oh, thank God.

1905
02:30:13,680 --> 02:30:15,060
I'm locking in.

1906
02:30:15,700 --> 02:30:16,940
I'm locking in.

1907
02:30:17,840 --> 02:30:18,400
No, yeah.

1908
02:30:19,240 --> 02:30:20,680
Just determination.

1909
02:30:37,070 --> 02:30:37,870
Oh, my God.

1910
02:30:38,070 --> 02:30:39,350
I almost touched me.

1911
02:30:43,850 --> 02:30:47,090
Where is my pipe?

1912
02:30:47,930 --> 02:30:49,090
Okay.

My god!

1915
02:31:13,800 --> 02:31:15,140
Okay, that one was bullshit.

1916
02:31:16,100 --> 02:31:18,420
That one was actually bullshit.

1917
02:32:34,790 --> 02:32:35,010
What?

1918
02:32:35,650 --> 02:32:41,710
What do you mean, kid you?

1919
02:32:43,830 --> 02:32:45,230
What?

1920
02:34:04,840 --> 02:34:06,940

1921
02:34:07,700 --> 02:34:09,360
Not tonight.

1922
02:34:14,740 --> 02:34:15,560
Not...

1923
02:34:15,560 --> 02:34:16,760
Not tonight.

1924
02:34:24,710 --> 02:34:26,950
Monday wins again.

1925
02:34:29,070 --> 02:34:30,530
It's one hit.

1926
02:34:31,030 --> 02:34:31,030
Okay.

1927
02:34:32,190 --> 02:34:33,670
It's one hit.

1928
02:34:34,070 --> 02:34:34,070
Okay.

1929
02:34:35,290 --> 02:34:35,290
Okay.

1930
02:34:37,310 --> 02:34:39,670
Maybe, you know, let's pray to Nerval.

1931
02:34:40,310 --> 02:34:43,510
Maybe Nerval lock the fuck in.

1932
02:34:43,910 --> 02:34:47,510
Guys, maybe, maybe Nerval will help me, guys.

1933
02:34:48,170 --> 02:34:48,490
Maybe.

1934
02:34:51,710 --> 02:34:55,730
Oh Oh

1938
02:35:28,910 --> 02:35:33,450
I think Nervo, I think Nervo peace out after what we both saw.

1939
02:35:33,950 --> 02:35:35,050
I'm pretty sure.

1940
02:35:35,490 --> 02:35:38,270
I'm pretty sure even Nervo was like, I'm out of nowhere.

1941
02:35:38,490 --> 02:35:39,530
You're on your own.

1942
02:35:39,830 --> 02:35:42,010
You're on your own.

1943
02:35:45,870 --> 02:35:50,710
That, yeah, I had a feeling that was not one hit, guys.

1944
02:35:51,190 --> 02:35:52,550

1945
02:35:52,690 --> 02:35:54,130

Speak with such a streak.

1980
02:38:51,410 --> 02:38:54,210
Shake and shudder in surprise.

1981
02:38:54,230 --> 02:38:57,030
when you hear these zombies streak.

1982
02:38:58,410 --> 02:39:02,930
We're so sorry, Skeletons, you are so misunderstood.

1983
02:39:04,170 --> 02:39:09,710
You only want to socialize, but I don't think we should.

1984
02:39:10,630 --> 02:39:15,830
A spooky, scary science field shout, starting shrilly screens.

1985
02:39:16,470 --> 02:39:21,890
They'll sneak from their sarcophagus and just won't leave you be.

1991
02:40:00,590 --> 02:40:03,110
Six and stones will break your bones.

1992
02:40:03,370 --> 02:40:05,790
They seldom let you snooze.

1993
02:40:06,730 --> 02:40:11,210
Spooky, scary, sand field will wake you with...

1994
02:40:11,210 --> 02:40:12,530
Oh, I don't know why.

1995

I didn't even practice a song.

1996
02:40:17,510 --> 02:40:19,610
I have the remix version of this.

1997
02:40:22,330 --> 02:40:24,170
I just went in blind.

1998
02:40:30,390 --> 02:40:55,830

This one's awesome.

2001
02:41:00,870 --> 02:41:02,310
This one's also pretty spooky.

2002
02:41:02,590 --> 02:41:03,910
Oh, we have up the volume.

2003
02:41:04,650 --> 02:41:05,190
Don't worry.

2004
02:41:07,770 --> 02:41:07,790
Five.

2005
02:41:08,510 --> 02:41:10,830
Snuck in kitchen late at night.

2006
02:41:11,490 --> 02:41:14,410
Nate, a donut with a maple glaze.

2007
02:41:15,270 --> 02:41:15,570
Oh!

2008
02:41:17,210 --> 02:41:20,270
My father asked who ate that snack.

2009
02:41:20,830 --> 02:41:23,950
I said that if what was my brother Jack.

2010
02:41:24,230 --> 02:41:28,710
and Jack got grounded for 14 days.

2011
02:41:30,030 --> 02:41:37,550
I've lived with that guilt all of my life and a terrible vision that I had that night.

2012
02:41:39,770 --> 02:41:42,270
Please, I don't want to go back.

2013
02:41:44,370 --> 02:41:50,070
Down, down, his soul is cast from the earth when Sporky fell.

2014
02:41:50,370 --> 02:41:56,390
The path of fire leads the sea to spooky Mormon hell dream.

2015
02:41:56,730 --> 02:42:02,330

Jesus hates you, this we know, for Jesus has told you so.

2024
02:43:03,490 --> 02:43:06,730
You remember Lucifer, he is even spookier!

2026
02:43:13,030 --> 02:43:15,130

Kevin was caught playing hooky.

2028
02:43:18,450 --> 02:43:21,150
Now he's back with all you Catholics and Jews.

2029

I can fuck this corpse.

2033
02:43:58,010 --> 02:43:59,010
I can say that.

2034
02:43:59,310 --> 02:44:00,750
J-Freeed.

2035
02:44:01,290 --> 02:44:02,190
And that's bad.

2036
02:44:02,430 --> 02:44:03,390
I've worked for 72.

2037
02:44:03,930 --> 02:44:05,350
I left my companion.

2038
02:44:05,730 --> 02:44:06,910
I'm way worse than you.

2039
02:44:07,470 --> 02:44:10,230
Ain't this spooky Mormon hell dream.

2040
02:44:11,070 --> 02:44:12,830
Mormon hell dream.

2041
02:44:14,110 --> 02:44:16,150
Oh, Heavenly Father.

2042
02:44:16,990 --> 02:44:19,130
Oh, please give me all my chance.

2043
02:44:19,710 --> 02:44:21,830
I won't break the rules again.

2044
02:44:24,050 --> 02:44:27,730
A spooky Mormon helldream from the book of Mormon.

2045
02:44:32,250 --> 02:44:35,090
It's written by our guys that so far.

2046
02:44:35,390 --> 02:44:37,270
I don't know if that seems obvious.

2047
02:44:40,730 --> 02:44:42,250
It is spooky.

2048
02:44:43,610 --> 02:44:44,210
It's Halloween.

2049
02:44:49,650 --> 02:44:52,950
Can't believe Jesus called me a day!

2050
02:45:01,670 --> 02:45:09,310
Welcome to Spooky Mormon Helldream.

2051
02:45:10,490 --> 02:45:16,710
You are never waking up from spooky Mormon Helldream.

2052
02:45:17,570 --> 02:45:19,090
Help this hell be fodder.

2053
02:45:19,310 --> 02:45:20,330
Please let me wake up.

2054
02:45:20,390 --> 02:45:21,910
Give me one more chance.

2055
02:45:22,170 --> 02:45:24,230
I won't let you down again.

2056
02:45:25,930 --> 02:45:28,390
Spooky Mormon Helldream, y'all!

2057
02:45:29,570 --> 02:45:29,970
Yeah.

2058
02:45:35,600 --> 02:45:41,700
That is Spooky Mormon Helldream from the Book of Mormon.

2059
02:45:42,380 --> 02:45:45,520
And I felt like, you know, that's like me.

2060
02:45:46,740 --> 02:45:51,760
I feel like that's the only month that where it's appropriate to sing that song.

2061
02:45:54,700 --> 02:45:57,880
I don't know if the music's too loud or anything else.

2062
02:45:57,900 --> 02:45:58,740
I hope sound got.

2063
02:45:58,820 --> 02:46:01,940
is okay with the sound volume

2064
02:46:08,190 --> 02:46:32,990
um stay hydrated spooky mormon i actually watched the book of mormon um live on broadway with the urgent cast with like josh gad and the other guy i don't remember before josh gad before i uh became like you know where he was just became an industry plant um I actually watched the Book of Mormon on Broadway with the original cast.

2065
02:46:34,130 --> 02:46:34,670
It was good.

2066
02:46:35,210 --> 02:46:36,890
And then I watched it with a friend.

2067
02:46:37,270 --> 02:46:39,530
I told this story before, but I watched this with a friend.

2068
02:46:39,670 --> 02:46:43,330
I bought tickets for my friend and her little brother.

2069
02:46:44,130 --> 02:46:51,790
And I thought her little brother was like a teenager because he's like taller than her.

2070
02:46:52,670 --> 02:46:56,530
And then like, you know, because the Book of Mormon is not very appropriate.

2071
02:46:58,750 --> 02:47:03,870
musical and then later on she was like yeah my brother's like 10.

I'm heading there.

2078
02:48:46,970 --> 02:48:48,890
I'm heading to spooky Mormon hell.

2079
02:48:52,570 --> 02:48:54,350
There's nothing I can do.

2080
02:48:54,730 --> 02:48:55,530
There's nothing.

2081
02:48:57,190 --> 02:49:00,970
What have you done to- I didn't know!

2082
02:49:01,390 --> 02:49:04,050
How was I supposed to know?

2083
02:49:04,590 --> 02:49:07,210
How- I don't understand.

2084
02:49:07,850 --> 02:49:09,990
How was I supposed to know?

2085
02:49:10,470 --> 02:49:11,450
He was dead.

2086
02:49:11,810 --> 02:49:13,970
He was taller than her!

2087
02:49:14,730 --> 02:49:18,310
He was- He was so much taller than her.

2088
02:49:18,550 --> 02:49:20,150
He was taller than me!

2089
02:49:21,190 --> 02:49:23,630
I can't even give him- I didn't fully feed him.

You are not gaslighting me.

I literally looked at the cans and I was like, wait a minute.

2102
02:50:17,550 --> 02:50:19,730

One hiding under your bed.

02:51:28,690 --> 02:51:31,110
Deep ground sharp and eyes glowing red.

I am the one hiding under your stairs.

Skeleton Jack might catch you in the back and scream like a banshee.

Make each other out of your skin.

I don't know.

2155
02:55:03,030 --> 02:55:07,470
I mean, I would have said, Chalapa, but like, dude, you don't have a karaoke of that, unfortunately.

2156
02:55:07,950 --> 02:55:11,510
Uh, you're walking down the hallway.

2157
02:55:12,230 --> 02:55:14,010
They're in the corner of your ICM.

2158
02:55:14,010 --> 02:55:14,890
Child above.

2159
02:55:16,250 --> 02:55:17,530
I don't know.

2160
02:55:17,830 --> 02:55:18,510
Wait, is it this?

2161
02:55:18,830 --> 02:55:19,670
Oh, they do.

2162
02:55:19,850 --> 02:55:22,490
Wait, they do have it in care of fun.

2163
02:55:23,210 --> 02:55:25,410
This is the best song ever made.

2164
02:55:28,290 --> 02:55:29,410
You're walking in the woods.

2165
02:55:30,430 --> 02:55:31,470
There's no one around.

2166
02:55:31,790 --> 02:55:32,650
Your phone is dead.

2167
02:55:32,710 --> 02:55:34,210
Wait, I gotta be more immersed for this.

2168
02:55:34,690 --> 02:55:35,210
There we go.

2169
02:55:35,410 --> 02:55:38,570
I think this...

2170
02:55:38,570 --> 02:55:39,390
Give me a sec.

2171
02:55:42,320 --> 02:55:43,720
You're walking in the woods.

2172
02:55:44,540 --> 02:55:45,800
There's no one around.

2173
02:55:46,020 --> 02:55:48,220
and your phone is dead out of the corner.

2174
02:55:52,020 --> 02:55:55,400
He's following you about 30 feet back on

2175
02:55:59,450 --> 02:55:59,870
you.

2176
02:56:00,270 --> 02:56:01,790
Shia LaBeouf.

2177
02:56:02,350 --> 02:56:04,870
You're looking for your car, but you're all turned around.

2178
02:56:05,350 --> 02:56:07,150
He's almost upon you now.

2179
02:56:07,610 --> 02:56:09,210
You see, there's blood in his face.

2180
02:56:09,570 --> 02:56:11,730
My God, there's blood everywhere.

2181
02:56:12,550 --> 02:56:14,490
Running for your life from Shia LaBeouf.

2182
02:56:14,830 --> 02:56:17,130
He's brandishing a night in Shia LaBeouf.

2183
02:56:17,390 --> 02:56:18,910
Lurking in the shadows.

2184
02:56:19,950 --> 02:56:22,050
Hollywood superstar Shia LaBeouf.

2185
02:56:22,470 --> 02:56:23,430
Living in the woods.

2186
02:56:23,550 --> 02:56:24,550
Shilabove!

2187
02:56:24,730 --> 02:56:25,910
Killing for sport!

2188
02:56:26,510 --> 02:56:27,110
Shilabove!

2189
02:56:27,450 --> 02:56:29,130
Eating all the bodies!

2190
02:56:29,930 --> 02:56:32,070
Actual cannibal, Shilabove!

2191
02:56:32,770 --> 02:56:35,130
Now it's dark, and you seem to have lost him.

2192
02:56:35,730 --> 02:56:37,550
But you're hopelessly lost yourself.

2193
02:56:38,090 --> 02:56:42,030
Stranded with a murderer, you creep silently through the underbush.

2194
02:56:42,630 --> 02:56:42,930
Aha!

2195
02:56:42,990 --> 02:56:43,710
In the distance!

2196
02:56:44,470 --> 02:56:46,490
A small cottage with a light on!

2197
02:56:47,150 --> 02:56:49,090
Hope, you move steadily forward.

2198
02:56:49,470 --> 02:56:50,190
But your leg!

2199
02:56:50,450 --> 02:56:50,730
Ah!

2200
02:56:50,970 --> 02:56:52,330
It's caught in a bear trap!

2201
02:56:52,590 --> 02:56:53,450
Climb off your leg!

2202
02:56:53,550 --> 02:56:56,150
Limping to the cottage.

2203
02:56:56,890 --> 02:56:59,330
Now you're on the doorstep.

2204
02:56:59,890 --> 02:57:01,030
Sending aside.

2205
02:57:01,270 --> 02:57:01,990
Shilabuff.

2206
02:57:02,290 --> 02:57:03,410
Sharpening axe.

2207
02:57:03,750 --> 02:57:04,450
Shilabuff.

2208
02:57:04,870 --> 02:57:06,190
If he doesn't hear you enter.

2209
02:57:06,230 --> 02:57:09,450
Shilabuff, you're sneaking up behind him.

2210
02:57:09,870 --> 02:57:12,050
Strangling superstar Shilabuff.

2211
02:57:12,430 --> 02:57:14,470
Fighting for your life with Shilabuff.

2212
02:57:14,850 --> 02:57:17,070
Wrestling a knife from Shilabuff.

2213
02:57:17,450 --> 02:57:18,750
Stabbing his kidney.

2214
02:57:19,850 --> 02:57:21,990
Safe out blast from Shilabuff.

2215
02:57:21,990 --> 02:57:27,890
You leap into the dark woods, blood oozing from your stomp leg.

2216
02:57:28,830 --> 02:57:30,990
You've beaten Shia LaBeouf.

2217
02:57:31,950 --> 02:57:34,470
Wait, he's a dead shy surprise.

2218
02:57:34,730 --> 02:57:37,190
There's a gun to your head and death in your eyes.

2219
02:57:37,450 --> 02:57:38,850
We can't do just this, too.

2220
02:57:39,690 --> 02:57:42,070
Body slam superstar Shia LaBeouf.

2221
02:57:42,530 --> 02:57:44,570
Legendary fight with Shia LaBeouf.

2222
02:57:44,810 --> 02:57:47,010
Normal choosing knife with Shia LaBeouf.

2223
02:57:47,130 --> 02:57:49,490
You try the swinging axe at Shia LaBeouf.

2224
02:57:49,710 --> 02:57:51,970
But the blood is draining fast from your stomp leg.

2225
02:57:51,990 --> 02:57:53,430
He's dodging every swipe.

2226
02:57:53,550 --> 02:57:54,630
He parries to the left.

2227
02:57:54,830 --> 02:57:55,890
You counter to the right.

2228
02:57:56,070 --> 02:57:57,130
You catch him in the neck.

2229
02:57:57,350 --> 02:57:59,250
You're chopping off his head now.

2230
02:58:00,070 --> 02:58:02,130
You have just evaporated Shiloh above.

2231
02:58:03,230 --> 02:58:04,770
His head topples to the floor.

2232
02:58:05,750 --> 02:58:06,270
Expressionless.

2233
02:58:06,910 --> 02:58:10,230
You fall to your knees and catch your breath.

2234
02:58:10,970 --> 02:58:14,310
You're finally safe from Shiloh above.

2235
02:59:12,050 --> 02:59:12,570
Perfect.

2236
02:59:12,970 --> 02:59:13,230
Oops.

2237
02:59:13,810 --> 02:59:14,850
I forgot the microphone.

2238
02:59:15,110 --> 02:59:15,770
What was it called?

2239
02:59:15,850 --> 02:59:17,390
There was another one that he did.

2240
02:59:20,130 --> 02:59:21,050
Try and remember.

2241
02:59:22,090 --> 02:59:24,410
It was like, it was, it was...

2242
02:59:24,410 --> 02:59:25,750
Oh my gosh, I don't remember.

2243
02:59:25,950 --> 02:59:26,730
I cannot remember.

2244
02:59:27,450 --> 02:59:31,430
Alright, if this bot gets marked, I'm sorry.

2245
02:59:34,570 --> 02:59:35,330
No, he did another one.

2246
02:59:35,390 --> 02:59:36,410
It's also pretty good.

2247
02:59:37,830 --> 02:59:39,710
I don't know this song very well.

2248
02:59:40,090 --> 02:59:41,390
But I know everyone does.

2249
02:59:42,610 --> 02:59:43,970
I mean, I was like, that's your way.

2250
02:59:43,990 --> 02:59:45,230
That's Halloween appropriate.

2251
02:59:57,090 --> 03:00:01,950
I should never watch Ghostbusters, so I don't know if I can sing this.

2252
03:00:02,730 --> 03:00:02,990
Ghostbusters!

2253
03:00:04,590 --> 03:00:07,350
There's something strange in your neighborhood.

2254
03:00:08,730 --> 03:00:09,770
Who are you gonna call?

2255
03:00:10,610 --> 03:00:11,330
Ghostbusters!

2256
03:00:12,630 --> 03:00:15,970
There's something weird and it don't look right.

2257
03:00:17,190 --> 03:00:18,290
Who are you gonna call?

2258
03:00:20,270 --> 03:00:21,250
Ghostbusters!

2259
03:00:21,570 --> 03:00:21,850
.

2260
03:00:21,850 --> 03:00:22,390
.

2261
03:00:23,570 --> 03:00:24,550
.

2262
03:00:24,550 --> 03:00:25,550
.

2263
03:00:25,550 --> 03:00:26,350
.

2264
03:00:26,350 --> 03:00:26,790
.

2265
03:00:26,790 --> 03:00:27,170
.

2266
03:00:27,170 --> 03:00:27,210
.

2267
03:00:27,210 --> 03:00:28,310
.

2268
03:00:28,310 --> 03:00:28,430
.

2269
03:00:48,750 --> 03:00:51,650
your head, who can you call?

2270
03:00:52,410 --> 03:00:53,050
Ghostbusters!

2271
03:00:54,450 --> 03:01:00,190
An invisible man sleeping in your bed, who you gonna call?

2272
03:01:00,750 --> 03:01:01,430
Ghostbusters!

2273
03:01:06,510 --> 03:01:08,930
I'm afraid of the ghost.

2274
03:01:11,390 --> 03:01:12,990
I'm afraid of the ghost.

2275
03:01:13,890 --> 03:01:17,170
I'm afraid of the ghost.

2276
03:01:20,490 --> 03:01:24,790
Who are you gonna call?

2277
03:01:25,770 --> 03:01:26,570
Ghostbusters!

2278
03:01:28,390 --> 03:01:29,310
All alone.

2279
03:01:30,150 --> 03:01:31,290
Pick up the phone.

2280
03:01:32,150 --> 03:01:32,990
And call.

2281
03:01:38,360 --> 03:01:39,920
What's the fate of no ghost?

2282
03:01:40,300 --> 03:01:41,700
This is four minutes?

2283
03:01:42,640 --> 03:01:44,020
I hear a nice girl.

2284
03:01:44,720 --> 03:01:45,020
What?

2285
03:01:45,780 --> 03:01:48,120
I ain't afraid of no ghost.

2286
03:01:50,900 --> 03:01:52,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

2287
03:01:57,260 --> 03:01:58,660
We're gonna call it.

2288
03:01:58,980 --> 03:01:59,780
Ghostbusters!

2289
03:01:59,960 --> 03:02:04,620
You have, what the fuck?

2290
03:02:07,610 --> 03:02:08,150
Ghostbusters!

2291
03:02:09,210 --> 03:02:11,930
I don't know those lines.

2292
03:02:12,910 --> 03:02:14,810
I just know he goes, Ghostbusters!

2293
03:02:17,570 --> 03:02:19,070
It's more?

2294
03:02:21,550 --> 03:02:23,630
Let me tell you something.

2295
03:02:24,710 --> 03:02:26,550
Busted makes me feel good!

2296
03:02:29,390 --> 03:02:31,690
Buna-na-da-da-na-na-na.

2297
03:02:32,790 --> 03:02:34,250
I'm afraid no ghost.

2298
03:02:40,750 --> 03:02:42,610
I'm afraid no ghost.

2299
03:02:43,530 --> 03:02:44,350
No,

2300
03:02:47,450 --> 03:02:48,090
no.

2301
03:02:53,560 --> 03:02:55,170
Let's just want some more.

2302
03:02:55,870 --> 03:02:58,250
I think you better call Ghostbusters.

2303
03:02:59,470 --> 03:03:01,430
I'm literally the person that's ghost, Ghostbusters.

2304
03:03:02,050 --> 03:03:02,670
Ghostbusters!

2305
03:03:03,370 --> 03:03:05,170
Who you gonna call?

2306
03:03:05,990 --> 03:03:06,790
Ghostbusters!

2307
03:03:14,550 --> 03:03:15,250
Sisters!

2308
03:03:17,910 --> 03:03:19,310
Ghostbusters!

2309
03:03:21,890 --> 03:03:23,290
Ghostbusters!

2310
03:03:24,150 --> 03:03:27,370
I'm the background vocalist for my own karaoke.

2311
03:03:30,890 --> 03:03:31,710
Ghostbusters!

2312
03:03:39,050 --> 03:03:40,450
Ghostbusters!

2313
03:03:43,430 --> 03:03:44,830
Ghostbusters!

2314
03:03:47,210 --> 03:03:48,610
Ghostbusters!

2315
03:03:49,390 --> 03:03:49,410
Ghostbusters!

2316
03:03:49,410 --> 03:03:50,470
Is that it?

2317
03:03:51,310 --> 03:03:52,570
Ghostbusters!

2318
03:03:55,630 --> 03:03:57,030
Ghostbusters!

2319
03:03:59,410 --> 03:04:00,810
Ghostbusters!

2320
03:04:01,590 --> 03:04:01,770
Ghostbusters!

2321
03:04:02,930 --> 03:04:04,170
Ghostbusters!

2322
03:04:05,690 --> 03:04:13,010
It was 40 minutes four minutes, but I swear 80% of the song is just, who are you gonna call?

2323
03:04:14,990 --> 03:04:15,490
Ghostbusties!

2324
03:04:18,950 --> 03:04:19,450
Ghostbusties!

2325
03:04:21,810 --> 03:04:25,750
Guys, if this VOD lives, if this VOD doesn't live, I'm so sorry.

2326
03:04:27,050 --> 03:04:30,010
Yes, we're just gonna cut the karaoke portion out.

2327
03:04:30,450 --> 03:04:31,450
Yes, I don't know.

2328
03:04:32,510 --> 03:04:35,150
I don't know if it's gonna be alive, guys.

2329
03:04:40,550 --> 03:04:42,190
Oh, and a monster mash.

2330
03:04:42,390 --> 03:04:43,950
I don't remember the monster mash.

2331
03:04:46,110 --> 03:04:46,770
Let's see.

2332
03:04:46,830 --> 03:04:48,090
And a monster mash.

2333
03:04:49,750 --> 03:04:51,290
I don't remember the monster mash.

2334
03:04:53,990 --> 03:05:03,750
I think the last time I've ever heard the monster mash was from the Scooby-Doo movie where Shaggy and Scooby babysit like, babysit like a bunch of monster girls.

2335
03:05:03,930 --> 03:05:05,570
And they started doing the monster mash.

2336
03:05:05,710 --> 03:05:07,670
And I had like a VHS tape of that.

2337
03:05:08,390 --> 03:05:10,330
and then I would re-watch that all the time.

2338
03:05:11,930 --> 03:05:15,350
And then the DVD came on and then I'd never watched it again.

2339
03:05:15,470 --> 03:05:16,490
Ha ha ha ha.

2340
03:05:19,230 --> 03:05:19,710
Whoa.

2341
03:05:23,710 --> 03:05:30,830
I was working in the lab late one night when my eyes beheld an eerie sight.

2342
03:05:31,110 --> 03:05:38,930
When my monsters from this lab began to rise and suddenly to my surprise, he did the mash.

2343
03:05:38,930 --> 03:06:05,690
He did the monster mash It was a graveyard smash It caught on in a flash He did the mash My laboratory in the castle east To the master bedroom where the vampires feast The ghouls all came from their humble abodes Get a job from electrodes

2344
03:06:08,930 --> 03:06:10,610
They did the monster mash.

2345
03:06:11,690 --> 03:06:13,250
It was a graveyard smash.

2346
03:06:13,430 --> 03:06:14,130
They did the mash.

2347
03:06:15,330 --> 03:06:16,910
It caught on in a flash.

2348
03:06:17,130 --> 03:06:17,690
They did the mash.

2349
03:06:18,710 --> 03:06:20,470
They did the monster mash.

2350
03:06:21,290 --> 03:06:23,130
Zombies were having fun.

2351
03:06:24,210 --> 03:06:26,690
The party had just begun.

2352
03:06:27,850 --> 03:06:33,710
The guests included Wolfman, Dracula, and his son.

2353
03:06:34,910 --> 03:06:37,930
The scene was rocking all her digging the sounds.

2354
03:06:38,930 --> 03:06:41,710
on chains backed by his banging hounds.

2355
03:06:42,430 --> 03:06:48,710
Coffin bangers, we're about to arrive with their vocal group, the Crypt Kicker Five.

2356
03:06:50,410 --> 03:06:52,050
They needed a monster mash.

2357
03:06:52,210 --> 03:06:53,050
Monster mash.

2358
03:06:53,890 --> 03:06:55,670
And it was a graveyard smash.

2359
03:06:55,850 --> 03:06:56,550
They played the mash.

2360
03:06:57,450 --> 03:06:59,130
It's caught on in flash.

2361
03:06:59,330 --> 03:07:00,070
They played the mash.

2362
03:07:00,930 --> 03:07:02,710
They did the master mash.

2363
03:07:03,510 --> 03:07:06,310
Out from his coffin, Drax boasted ring.

2364
03:07:06,810 --> 03:07:09,690
Seems he was troubled by just one thing.

2365
03:07:10,530 --> 03:07:17,090
He opened the lid and shook his fist and said, whatever happened to the Transylvania twist.

2366
03:07:18,150 --> 03:07:20,290
It's now the Monster Mash.

2367
03:07:21,690 --> 03:07:23,970
It's now a graveyard smash.

2368
03:07:25,230 --> 03:07:27,370
It's got on it on a flash.

2369
03:07:28,790 --> 03:07:30,950
It's now the Monster Mash.

2370
03:07:31,870 --> 03:07:34,410
Now everything's cool, it's a part of the band.

2371
03:07:35,070 --> 03:07:37,970
My Monster Mash is the head of the land.

2372
03:07:38,630 --> 03:07:41,490
For you, the living this mash was meant to.

2373
03:07:41,910 --> 03:07:45,070
When you get to my door, it's all that Boris sent you.

2374
03:07:46,790 --> 03:07:48,590
Then you can monster mash.

2375
03:07:50,370 --> 03:07:52,070
And do my graveyard smash.

2376
03:07:53,890 --> 03:07:55,770
You'll catch on in the flash.

2377
03:07:57,370 --> 03:07:59,530
Then you can monster mash.

2378
03:08:00,150 --> 03:08:03,550
Oh, mash good.

2379
03:08:04,270 --> 03:08:05,350

Oh, mash good.

Oh, is this like the Frankenstein singing along?

2383
03:08:19,170 --> 03:08:20,210
Easy, Gort.

Double clips.

I should need to listen again.

03:11:23,600 --> 03:11:26,780
Guys, you slowly walking in the group stalking.

You, you being the only man alive.

Then All your friends, they try to kill us, but only because they be jealous.

2404
03:11:39,840 --> 03:11:43,500
There are lovers deeper than Edward and Bella's.

2405
03:11:44,500 --> 03:11:49,580
Oh, if I were a zombie, I'd never eat your brain.

2409
03:12:04,660 --> 03:12:14,320
I hear Rambana, second floor apartment, knocking all the stairs down to save your life from the undead.

2410
03:12:16,560 --> 03:12:22,300
Double-barrow shotguns, taking up the slow ones, then you see the passion burning in my eye.

2411
03:12:22,920 --> 03:12:25,060
And I keep my hand.

2412
03:12:26,460 --> 03:12:34,640
Then all of your friends, they try to kill us, but only because they be jealous that our love is deeper than Edward and Belle.

2413
03:12:36,180 --> 03:12:41,780
Oh, if I were a zombie, I'd never eat your brain.

2414
03:12:42,540 --> 03:12:43,940
I just want your heart.

2415
03:12:44,220 --> 03:12:45,140
Yeah, I want your heart.

2416
03:12:45,440 --> 03:12:46,540
I just want your heart.

2417
03:12:46,840 --> 03:12:51,760
Yeah, oh, if I were a zombie, I'd never eat your brain.

2418
03:12:52,880 --> 03:12:54,360
I just want your heart.

2419
03:12:54,680 --> 03:12:55,560
Yeah, I want your heart.

2420
03:12:55,740 --> 03:12:57,960
I just want your heart because I want you.

2421
03:13:00,100 --> 03:13:01,620
What is this song?

2422
03:13:02,120 --> 03:13:04,340
It's like girl bait.

2423
03:13:06,840 --> 03:13:37,820
I respect you too much So that's why I wait until we got married Oh That our happiest days would be spent Picking off all your friends But I see I'd love to see Won't stay buried It's for girls who are like Raw XD Raw means I love you That's what the song is for target audience and damn I listened to that song.

2424
03:13:40,920 --> 03:13:42,940
I was the target audience.

2425
03:13:43,460 --> 03:13:47,680
Yeah, I want your heart because I want your heart because I want you.

2426
03:13:49,480 --> 03:13:51,100
Only in there.

2427
03:13:51,960 --> 03:13:57,060
I thought those but that's why I was so surprised that they had this song.

2428
03:13:57,540 --> 03:13:59,580
I was like, oh my god.

2429
03:14:00,020 --> 03:14:02,160
Wait, they have a key.

2430
03:14:02,600 --> 03:14:04,640
I was like, do they have the zombie song?

2431
03:14:04,660 --> 03:14:07,920
I was like, that's another Halloween song that I know.

2432
03:14:11,120 --> 03:14:14,420
Yeah, I was a raw XD girl.

2433
03:14:14,620 --> 03:14:16,200
I was like, Tiki, random.

2434
03:14:20,300 --> 03:14:21,460
Oh, isn't that...

2435
03:14:21,460 --> 03:14:22,880
I've never played Plants vs.

2436
03:14:22,880 --> 03:14:23,840
Zombies, though.

2437
03:14:24,180 --> 03:14:26,540
I've never played Plants vs.

2438
03:14:26,560 --> 03:14:27,020
Zombies.

2439
03:14:27,140 --> 03:14:29,580
So I know, like, what is it?

2440
03:14:29,580 --> 03:14:30,820
Zombies on my lawn?

2441
03:14:30,980 --> 03:14:32,480
Is it from there?

2442
03:14:33,040 --> 03:14:33,820
You don't...

2443
03:14:35,140 --> 03:14:36,020
in memory.

2444
03:14:37,100 --> 03:14:38,640
I don't think they have it, though.

2445
03:14:38,980 --> 03:14:40,960
Okay, he is not baiting me to feed him again.

2446
03:14:41,160 --> 03:14:41,420
What?

2447
03:14:41,780 --> 03:14:42,040
Why?

2448
03:14:42,320 --> 03:14:42,700
No.

2449
03:14:43,480 --> 03:14:43,880
No.

2450
03:14:44,060 --> 03:14:45,280
He's so bratty now.

2451
03:14:45,400 --> 03:14:46,160
I don't know why.

2452
03:14:46,640 --> 03:14:48,140
Can't be because of me.

2453
03:14:48,660 --> 03:14:51,860
No, I never played plants versus zombies.

2454
03:14:52,100 --> 03:14:54,440
I think, like, I was an angry birds gal.

2455
03:14:55,460 --> 03:14:59,120
You know, you're either a plants versus zombie or an angry birds gal.

2456
03:14:59,560 --> 03:15:01,020
That was an angry birds gal.

2457
03:15:01,180 --> 03:15:02,780
I didn't play plants versus zombie.

2458
03:15:03,340 --> 03:15:04,560
I don't know what they're saying.

2459
03:15:04,660 --> 03:15:06,380
Halloween songs are out there.

2460
03:15:08,440 --> 03:15:10,160
Like, Mother likes... No!

2461
03:15:10,700 --> 03:15:11,280
No, he doesn't.

2462
03:15:11,340 --> 03:15:12,620
I'm a good person.

2463
03:15:15,700 --> 03:15:16,860
I can't... I don't know.

2464
03:15:17,040 --> 03:15:17,900
Five Nights at Freddy?

2465
03:15:18,060 --> 03:15:24,300
I need, like, I need, like, the robot filter for it, but I don't have that on my Go XLR.

2466
03:15:26,620 --> 03:15:28,000
But... I don't know.

2467
03:15:29,660 --> 03:15:31,240
It doesn't work the same.

2468
03:15:31,280 --> 03:15:34,240
It doesn't feel the same without my robot filter.

2469
03:15:42,960 --> 03:15:49,700
We're waiting every night to finally roam and invite newcomers to play with us.

2470
03:15:49,760 --> 03:15:52,380
For many years, we've been all the long...

2471
03:15:52,380 --> 03:15:53,320
I don't know, that's hard.

2472
03:15:54,320 --> 03:15:56,080
Yeah, I need the robot feeling.

2473
03:15:56,100 --> 03:15:57,100
I mean, I could do this.

2474
03:15:57,220 --> 03:15:59,200
Does this sound more of a nappy?

2475
03:15:59,820 --> 03:16:00,200
Does it?

2476
03:16:01,240 --> 03:16:04,640
Since that's it, the boss or took our neck away.

2477
03:16:04,660 --> 03:16:07,120
Now we're stuck here to decay.

2478
03:16:07,900 --> 03:16:08,980
Oh no.

2479
03:16:09,580 --> 03:16:11,020
What is that note?

2480
03:16:12,380 --> 03:16:13,320
I'll turn it off.

2481
03:16:14,840 --> 03:16:15,880
It does sound strange.

2482
03:16:16,140 --> 03:16:19,520
Yeah, it's hard to sing without the Robo filter for this.

2483
03:16:19,600 --> 03:16:22,180
Because the song is not meant to be singing naturally.

2484
03:16:22,860 --> 03:16:24,480
Like even the lead singer.

2485
03:16:25,460 --> 03:16:26,720
Let's have friends.

2486
03:16:28,080 --> 03:16:29,760
Is this where you want to be?

2487
03:16:31,640 --> 03:16:34,580
Like even the lead singer has the Robo filter.

2488
03:16:35,300 --> 03:16:35,800
there.

2489
03:16:50,820 --> 03:16:52,900
I don't remember how to sing this song.

2490
03:16:53,040 --> 03:16:53,920
It's been so long.

2491
03:16:59,200 --> 03:16:59,780
We're really quite

2492
03:17:04,680 --> 03:17:07,600
surprised to get to see you another night.

2493
03:17:07,980 --> 03:17:09,900
You should have looked for another job.

2494
03:17:10,100 --> 03:17:12,620
You should have said to this place goodbye.

2495
03:17:13,020 --> 03:17:14,540
It's like there's so much more.

2496
03:17:14,700 --> 03:17:16,860
Maybe you've been in this place before.

2497
03:17:17,280 --> 03:17:19,300
We remember a face like yours.

2498
03:17:19,540 --> 03:17:21,940
You seem acquainted with those stories.

2499
03:17:22,220 --> 03:17:23,240
Please let us get in.

2500
03:17:23,340 --> 03:17:24,400
Don't walk us away.

2501
03:17:24,580 --> 03:17:26,040
We're not like what you're thinking.

2502
03:17:26,820 --> 03:17:31,040
We're poor little souls who have lost all control and we're forced to take that role.

2503
03:17:31,520 --> 03:17:35,240
We've been all alone, stuck in our little since 1987.

2504
03:17:36,200 --> 03:17:38,380
Join us, be our friend, or just be stuck in the fence.

2505
03:17:38,660 --> 03:17:42,000
After all, you only got five nights at Freddy's.

2506
03:17:42,600 --> 03:17:44,140
Is this where you wanna be?

2507
03:17:44,360 --> 03:17:46,900
I just don't get it.

2508
03:17:47,300 --> 03:17:51,720
Why do you wanna stay five nights at Freddy's?

2509
03:17:51,920 --> 03:17:53,420
Is this where you wanna be?

2510
03:17:53,560 --> 03:17:56,220
I just don't get it.

2511
03:17:56,640 --> 03:18:00,560
Why do you wanna stay five nights at Freddy's?

2512
03:18:03,540 --> 03:18:07,860
So, ah, I didn't take enough breath for that.

2513
03:18:07,960 --> 03:18:08,360
Ah,

2514
03:18:21,500 --> 03:18:23,480
I didn't take enough breath for that one.

2515
03:18:23,780 --> 03:18:25,400
I was just like, fuck it.

2516
03:18:27,540 --> 03:18:30,320
Five nights at Freddy's.

2517
03:18:30,820 --> 03:18:34,160
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2518
03:18:36,540 --> 03:19:11,980

2520
03:19:17,680 --> 03:19:25,820
It's just it's just the story is just not the best I love the songs though.

2521
03:19:25,900 --> 03:19:27,200
I love the songs.

2522
03:19:27,300 --> 03:19:30,260
It's just the pacing for that is so bad Like,

2523
03:19:33,500 --> 03:19:42,500
yeah, and the writing, yeah, the writing is meh, but like, you know, it's written by, what's your name?

2524
03:19:42,680 --> 03:19:49,360
I don't know how to pronounce your name, and, like, she uses, like, swearing as, like, a crutch, not gonna lie, just like me.

2525
03:19:50,140 --> 03:19:50,540
Fuck.

03:19:55,200 --> 03:19:59,400
Um, no, like, for season one, I watched, I stopped that episode, too.

I did the monster mash.

2530
03:20:55,800 --> 03:20:56,860
He did the mash.

2531
03:20:57,900 --> 03:20:58,300

2532
03:20:58,900 --> 03:20:58,900
No.

2533
03:21:00,620 --> 03:21:01,960
He did the mash.

2534
03:21:02,700 --> 03:21:02,880
I'm

03:21:06,650 --> 03:21:07,270
not.

2536
03:21:11,190 --> 03:21:17,910
There's not a lot of Halloween songs compared to like Christmas songs now that I think about it.

2537
03:21:18,190 --> 03:21:19,970
There's actually not that many.

2538
03:21:20,810 --> 03:21:22,030
Let me see.

2539
03:21:23,630 --> 03:21:29,110

That's another Halloween song I know.

2542
03:22:48,630 --> 03:22:53,990
Into a land of enchantment.

2543
03:22:55,270 --> 03:23:01,370
Come little dragons, the times come to play.

2544
03:23:02,790 --> 03:23:08,810
Here in my garden of magic.

2545

2546
03:23:47,650 --> 03:23:50,270
And in this world, like, I start abducting kids.

2547
03:23:51,030 --> 03:23:52,830
And, like, I don't know, killed them, I think.

2548
03:23:53,010 --> 03:23:54,070
I didn't watch the movie.

2549
03:23:54,150 --> 03:23:55,670
I just listened to the songs.

2550
03:23:58,790 --> 03:24:02,250
I just, I assume that's what she did, right?

2551
03:24:03,970 --> 03:24:06,350
Yeah, she started abducting kids.

2552
03:24:06,910 --> 03:24:09,650
And they're like, I don't know, for a potion, I think.

2553
03:24:09,650 --> 03:24:11,690
To, like, murder them?

2554
03:24:12,370 --> 03:24:14,030
Anyway, Chagoon's here.

2555
03:24:16,790 --> 03:24:17,430
That's...

2556
03:24:17,430 --> 03:24:19,790
Are you ready to get murdered?

2557
03:24:21,930 --> 03:24:23,350
Yeah, it is Disney.

2558
03:24:23,670 --> 03:24:25,810
But, like, Disney back then didn't fucking care.

2559
03:24:27,670 --> 03:24:30,110
There was a lot of murder back then.

2560
03:24:32,350 --> 03:24:38,070
Back then, Disney was not, like, super anal about murder for some reason.

2561
03:24:40,610 --> 03:24:41,950
Oh, this one.

2562
03:24:42,270 --> 03:24:44,450
I put a spell on you.

2563
03:24:47,750 --> 03:24:48,670
All right.

2564
03:24:49,330 --> 03:24:51,130
Oh, they don't have it divided.

2565
03:24:51,830 --> 03:24:52,110
Oh, my God.

2566
03:24:52,170 --> 03:24:54,010
I guess I'll be all three sisters, guys.

2567
03:24:54,530 --> 03:24:56,490
But spell on you.

2568
03:24:57,750 --> 03:25:00,490
And now you're mine.

2569
03:25:01,990 --> 03:25:04,930
Yet stop the things I do.

2570

And it was strong, strong, strong.

2577
03:25:56,950 --> 03:25:59,790
Your wretched little lies above its curse.

2578

And now you're mine.

Because I realize it's almost four hours now.

2593
03:27:50,830 --> 03:27:54,050
I did not think I was going to stream this long.

2594
03:27:57,390 --> 03:27:59,970
Guys, I was supposed to even though terrorize today.

2595

I know how it's like, you're in my world now, not your world.

2601
03:28:19,690 --> 03:28:23,650
And I've got friends on the other side.

2602
03:28:28,250 --> 03:28:29,290
That's an echo, gentlemen.

2603
03:28:29,590 --> 03:28:33,290
Just a little something we have here in Louisiana, a little parlor trick, don't worry.

2604
03:28:34,130 --> 03:28:35,910
Sit down at my table.

2605
03:28:36,470 --> 03:28:38,890
Put your minds at ease.

2606
03:28:39,230 --> 03:28:44,730
If you relax, it will enable me to do anything I pleased.

2607
03:28:45,630 --> 03:28:47,350
I can read your future.

2608
03:28:48,390 --> 03:28:50,130
I can change it around.

2609
03:28:50,890 --> 03:28:53,830
I'll look deep into your heart and soul.

2610
03:28:54,230 --> 03:28:55,550
You do have a soul, don't you, Lawrence?

03:29:03,970 --> 03:29:06,890
And I got friends on the other side.

2614
03:29:09,890 --> 03:29:14,970
The cars, the cars, the cars will tell.

2615
03:29:15,570 --> 03:29:18,310
The past, the present, and the future as well.

2616
03:29:18,890 --> 03:29:22,930
The cars, the cars, just take three.

2617
03:29:23,990 --> 03:29:27,350
Take a little trip into your future with me.

2618

Anyway.

2637
03:31:46,430 --> 03:31:49,130
Anyway, this was a song I wanted to, what was it called?

2638
03:31:50,050 --> 03:31:52,350
This was a song that I wish I know how to sing.

2639
03:31:53,930 --> 03:31:56,190
But I don't know how to sing this song.

2640
03:31:56,770 --> 03:32:00,450
But it's a good song so we're gonna jam it out with someone else singing it for me.

2641
03:32:03,690 --> 03:32:13,150
I low-key, I low-key think Monster High is a good show slash franchise.

2642
03:32:18,050 --> 03:32:23,930
Down the darkened hallway, everybody turns to look at you.

2643
03:32:25,490 --> 03:32:33,950
It's not because you're different, it's just because you're so scary, cool, sinister style.

2644
03:32:34,170 --> 03:32:37,570
with a smile, if they're gorgeous.

2645
03:32:38,270 --> 03:32:39,610
Drop their gorgeous.

2646
03:32:40,610 --> 03:32:45,770
He must fall near creeps, but when I'm with my peeps, you can't ignore us.

2647
03:32:46,050 --> 03:32:48,170
This is where the goal kids rule.

2648
03:32:48,950 --> 03:32:54,010
Monster, Monster, hi, Monster, Hi, monster, Monster, hi, come on don't be shy.

2649
03:32:54,370 --> 03:32:56,550
Monster, hi, but party never.

2650
03:32:56,710 --> 03:32:59,010
Monster, monster, hi, monster, high.

2651
03:32:59,550 --> 03:33:03,010
Monster, monster, Hi, klim, monster, hi.

2652
03:33:04,850 --> 03:33:06,350
Thank you, God, I'm falling apart.

2653
03:33:06,670 --> 03:33:08,310
Uh, Dracula is stealing my heart.

2654
03:33:08,590 --> 03:33:10,390
Caughty wolves, we make you hallowed moon.

2655
03:33:10,570 --> 03:33:12,350
Laguna, you're the finest fish in this lagoon.

2656
03:33:12,590 --> 03:33:14,310
Clear the Nile, you're so big gal.

2657
03:33:14,450 --> 03:33:15,990
Even though you act so vile.

2658
03:33:16,430 --> 03:33:18,130
And do that stone cold style.

2659
03:33:18,530 --> 03:33:21,930
Those are my booze, my skill in the crew, I'm a little strange, but so are you.

2660
03:33:22,710 --> 03:33:24,310
Don't you wanna be a monster too?

2661
03:33:25,030 --> 03:33:27,510
Oh, Ricky just got fabulous.

2662
03:33:29,390 --> 03:33:31,870
Everybody wants a piece of you.

2663
03:33:32,590 --> 03:33:33,550
I smile.

2664
03:33:35,770 --> 03:33:40,130
realistic, most characteristic, most hip and horrific.

2665
03:33:40,610 --> 03:33:43,790
A sinister style, mystery with a smile.

2666
03:33:44,110 --> 03:33:45,690
You're a drop dead gorgeous.

2667
03:33:46,050 --> 03:33:47,810
You're a drop dead gorgeous.

2668
03:33:48,310 --> 03:33:53,670
This gold gives me the crease, but when I'm with my peace, you can't ignore us.

2669
03:33:53,970 --> 03:33:56,130
This is where the gold kids run.

2670
03:33:56,610 --> 03:33:59,110
Monster, monster hide, monster hide.

2671
03:33:59,430 --> 03:34:00,470
Monster, monster hide.

2672
03:34:00,870 --> 03:34:03,030
Come on, don't be shy, monster hide.

2676
03:34:46,630 --> 03:34:50,390
I love, okay, I love Monster High.

2677
03:34:51,250 --> 03:34:53,350
Also love the fairy, what is it called?

2678
03:34:53,730 --> 03:34:57,270
Happily Ever After, bro, I was obsessed with that shit.

2679
03:34:57,670 --> 03:35:05,390
I watched like all the miniseries and the movies of like Ever After High and Monster High and like the web episodes and stuff.

2680
03:35:05,770 --> 03:35:37,130
just so interesting it was so good and then they like and then they made them 3d and then it got less good but i mean it was still all right i guess i still like watched a little bit and then they like they like discontinued ever after high i was so sad um apparently they rebooted monster high the web episode stuff again but at that point i didn't care as much anymore but had i had a I don't know.

2681
03:35:37,430 --> 03:35:40,790
It was just the story was so interesting.

2682
03:35:41,950 --> 03:35:45,370
And I just really enjoyed the story and the characters.

2683
03:35:45,770 --> 03:35:53,070
They were just so interesting because they're like all about being like, you know, they're monsters, but they're pretty fashionable monster.

2684
03:35:53,470 --> 03:35:53,970
I don't fucking know.

2685
03:35:54,070 --> 03:35:55,530
I just there was just something about it.

2686
03:35:57,530 --> 03:36:00,710
They were used to sell dolls and goddamn it worked.

2687
03:36:00,770 --> 03:36:04,170
I never owned a single Monster High doll, but so I guess it didn't work that well.

2688
03:36:06,070 --> 03:36:07,730
I was never a doll person.

2689
03:36:07,870 --> 03:36:09,590
I was a littlest pet shop.

2690
03:36:10,690 --> 03:36:11,790
I own a lot of...

2691
03:36:11,790 --> 03:36:15,570
The only doll thing I collected was littlest pet shop when I was growing up.

2692
03:36:15,870 --> 03:36:17,210
So, it didn't get me.

2693
03:36:17,310 --> 03:36:19,770
They didn't get me, but I did enjoy the shows.

2694
03:36:21,570 --> 03:36:23,570
Yeah, they're just monster girls, you know?

2695
03:36:23,810 --> 03:36:27,310
Yeah, there were some monster boys, but it wasn't as good as the girls.

2696
03:36:30,670 --> 03:36:32,630
Anyway, that's like...

2697
03:36:32,630 --> 03:36:35,750
Now that's all the Halloween songs I know, I think.

2698
03:36:35,770 --> 03:36:37,850

2705
03:38:58,680 --> 03:39:01,180
What the fuck?

2706
03:39:01,600 --> 03:39:02,540
It just doubles.

2707
03:39:04,720 --> 03:39:08,400
Even the caravan was like, that's it.

2708
03:39:08,480 --> 03:39:10,600
It started looping itself.

2712
03:40:16,210 --> 03:40:23,430
I don't know if season two gets better or anything, but I didn't want... I didn't know where it's but it's the fact that they made, like, a romance.

2713
03:40:23,910 --> 03:40:27,070
Because, like, I'm like, Wednesday doesn't fall in love, bro.

2714
03:40:28,050 --> 03:40:30,870
She is a strong independent woman!

2715
03:40:34,690 --> 03:40:35,050
Wait.

2716
03:40:35,350 --> 03:40:36,530
They don't have a lead vocal.

2717
03:40:36,690 --> 03:40:38,030
They don't know how... What the fuck?

2718
03:40:38,090 --> 03:40:39,510
I don't know how to sing this song.

2719
03:40:41,050 --> 03:40:43,090
It's takes its toy.

2720
03:40:44,190 --> 03:40:49,750
Do they have, like, Hello, I would need like vocal assistance for this because I don't remember how this goes.

2721
03:40:49,930 --> 03:40:55,370
The only time I've listened to this was on Glee Oh my god, they don't I'm sorry guys.

Goodbye, Rocky Horror Picture Show.

2727
03:41:55,730 --> 03:42:01,550
You would think that they would have someone doing guide vocals for this because it's a cult classic.

2728
03:42:03,330 --> 03:42:04,790
Yeah, but I don't know how to sing it.

2729
03:42:13,240 --> 03:42:15,300
I'll do Scooby-Doo, so I know.

2730
03:42:15,820 --> 03:42:16,980
This is the best version.

2731
03:42:17,440 --> 03:42:22,020
I sang this in members, but I would say that this version is the best version of Scooby-Doo.

2732
03:42:23,320 --> 03:42:24,340

Na na na na na na na na na na What's the Scooby Doo?

2755
03:43:24,720 --> 03:43:38,450
Yeah, I would say Simple Plan has the best Scooby Doo version of all time I don't like, I think like there's the best one out of all of them honestly Because like what was it?

2756
03:43:39,440 --> 03:43:40,060
What was that school?

2757
03:43:40,280 --> 03:43:51,940
I think that was also the best show too The best, the song that the show is from opening is from is also the best version of Scooby-Doo they've ever done.

2758
03:43:52,280 --> 03:43:54,240
The best animated show that they've ever done.

2759
03:43:54,560 --> 03:43:56,480
I don't know if people were like oh what about the Mystery Inc.

2760
03:43:56,520 --> 03:43:56,720
one?

2761
03:43:56,860 --> 03:43:59,020

03:43:59,700 --> 03:44:00,680
No no no no no.

2763
03:44:01,320 --> 03:44:07,380
I don't remember the show where the Scooby-Doo song Simple Plan was from is the best one.

2764
03:44:07,960 --> 03:44:08,720
I don't, yeah.

2765
03:44:09,520 --> 03:44:14,680
I know that Mystery Incorporated is good too but like I still think the other one's still better.

2766
03:44:15,220 --> 03:44:53,280
Yeah it's literally called What's New Scooby-Doo I know mystery ink was really good because they did a lot of character building and like you know Daphne was an actual character um but no no what's new Scooby-Doo um what's your Scooby-Doo banana na na na na na na na na na na na what's new Scooby-Doo with the other side I would be so happy you know what i looked up i was like did they have teletubbies

03:51:28,330 --> 03:51:29,190
Let's not overdo it.

2838
03:51:29,190 --> 03:51:30,090
What do you mean overdo it?

2839
03:51:30,130 --> 03:51:30,930
We don't want to sing it again.

2840
03:51:30,950 --> 03:51:31,310
Go!

2841
03:51:31,450 --> 03:51:32,130
Wait a minute, boys.

You did this.

2849
03:51:47,230 --> 03:51:50,850
I lost like 30 viewers that seeing that.

2850
03:51:50,950 --> 03:51:51,870
So I'm like, no.

2851

I'm out.

2852
03:51:55,810 --> 03:51:58,170
I don't even know what it sounded like.

2853
03:51:58,510 --> 03:52:00,810
I, you know, I don't even know.

2854
03:52:00,950 --> 03:52:02,350
I don't even know what I said.

2855
03:52:02,510 --> 03:52:05,230
I just saw a pitch up and I was like, all right, it's time.

2856
03:52:06,290 --> 03:52:08,710
They weren't strong enough.

2857
03:52:14,010 --> 03:52:18,030
I don't even know what that sounded like.

2858
03:52:19,090 --> 03:52:21,630
It's a very, very, I just pitched.

2859
03:52:21,870 --> 03:52:23,850
I don't even know how I just pitched it up.

2860
03:52:24,070 --> 03:52:24,730
That's all I did.

2861
03:52:28,110 --> 03:52:30,930
Today we are calling week one.

2862
03:52:30,950 --> 03:52:31,410

03:52:33,650 --> 03:52:37,530
Okay, okay, I'll do like two more Halloween songs for real this time.

2864
03:52:38,030 --> 03:52:38,950
Don't worry, we're not ending.

2865
03:52:39,290 --> 03:52:42,330
We're not ending with Alvin and the Chick-fil-A.

2866
03:52:46,570 --> 03:52:52,490
Oh, I love Alvin.

2867
03:52:52,670 --> 03:52:54,830
I watched all the live action movie.

2868
03:52:56,330 --> 03:52:56,930
Unironically.

2869
03:52:58,090 --> 03:53:03,370

2870
03:53:04,130 --> 03:53:07,450
I have the two of the two soundtracks for both of them.

2871
03:53:07,610 --> 03:53:11,170
I own the physical copies of both Alvin and Chick-Monks.

2872
03:53:11,610 --> 03:53:12,530
One and two.

2873
03:53:17,090 --> 03:53:18,250
So, rip away.

2874
03:53:18,470 --> 03:53:19,810
I am not ashamed.

2875
03:53:20,270 --> 03:53:24,950
I am not ashamed of my love for Alvin and the Chick-Monks.

2876
03:53:25,850 --> 03:53:27,410
Yeah, I watched all four of them.

2877
03:53:28,090 --> 03:53:29,790
I watched the, what was it?

2878
03:53:30,950 --> 03:53:40,970
The first one, the one when they added the ladies, the third one where they, um, where they got shipwrecked, and then the fourth one where they went on a road trip.

2879
03:53:46,070 --> 03:53:47,030
Don't worry.

2880
03:53:47,750 --> 03:53:48,990
I've seen it all.

2881
03:53:50,650 --> 03:53:52,270
I've seen it all.

2882
03:53:54,830 --> 03:53:57,650
There, yes, dude, it's called the road trip.

Do-do-do-do-do.

2896
03:56:03,030 --> 03:56:03,590
Bada-bada.

2897
03:56:04,170 --> 03:56:06,110
No, I keep singing the song anyway on stream.

2898
03:56:08,790 --> 03:56:16,330
I sing the song all the time on stream, it is, but I actually never heard the full song.

2899
03:56:16,450 --> 03:56:17,470
I just know that one.

2900
03:56:19,270 --> 03:56:29,790
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, my dog walked up to the lemon, they said, and said to the man running the sand, hey, bum, bum, bum, got any grapes?

2901
03:56:31,450 --> 03:56:37,830
The man said, no, we just sell lemonade, but it's cold and it's fresh and it's all how it and get you a glass.

2902
03:56:38,690 --> 03:56:39,770
The duck said, I'll pass.

2903
03:56:40,870 --> 03:56:44,650
Then he waddle away, waddle, waddle, till the very next day.

2904
03:56:44,910 --> 03:56:45,970
Bum, bum, bum, bum.

2905
03:56:47,130 --> 03:56:54,990
When a duck walked up to the lemon stand, he said to a man running the stand, hey, bum, bum, bum, got any grapes?

2906
03:56:56,810 --> 03:57:01,630
A man said no, like I said yesterday, we just sell lemonade, okay?

2907
03:57:02,030 --> 03:57:03,130
Why not give it a try?

2908
03:57:04,030 --> 03:57:05,010
The duck said goodbye.

2909
03:57:06,090 --> 03:57:29,910
Then he waddle the way, waddle, waddle, then he waddle the way, waddle, waddle, then he waddle the way, waddle, waddle, till the very next day, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, any grapes, the man said, look, this is getting old,

2910
03:57:30,130 --> 03:57:34,330
I mean, lemonade's all we've ever sold, but why not give it a go?

2911
03:57:36,670 --> 03:57:46,030
Then he waddle away, waddle, waddle, then he waddle the way, waddle, waddle, then he waddle the way, waddle waddle, till the very next day.

2912
03:57:46,190 --> 03:57:58,830
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, when a duck walked up to the lemonade stand, and he said to the man, running the stand, Hey, bum, bum, bum, gotta eat grapes.

2913
03:58:00,610 --> 03:58:05,850
The man said, That's it, if you don't stay away, duck, I'll glue you to a tree and leave you there all day stuck.

2914
03:58:06,090 --> 03:58:07,470
So don't get too close.

2915
03:58:08,130 --> 03:58:09,270
The duck said, adios.

2916
03:58:10,470 --> 03:58:12,470
Then he waddled the way, waddled.

2917
03:58:13,030 --> 03:58:15,070
Then he waddled the way, waddled.

2918
03:58:15,370 --> 03:58:17,370
Then he waddled the way, waddled.

2919
03:58:17,990 --> 03:58:21,870
Till the very next day, Bum, Bum, Bum, Bum, Bum, Bum, Bum.

2920
03:58:21,870 --> 03:58:30,050
The duck walked up to the lemonade stand, And he said to the man, Running the stand, Hey, Bum, Bum, Bum, got any glue?

2921
03:58:30,990 --> 03:58:31,310
What?

2922
03:58:31,770 --> 03:58:32,670
Got any glue?

2923
03:58:33,010 --> 03:58:33,750
No, why would I?

2924
03:58:33,990 --> 03:58:35,950
Oh, and one more question for you.

2925
03:58:37,770 --> 03:58:39,190
What would he say?

2926
03:58:39,470 --> 03:58:40,370
Got any grapes?

2927
03:58:40,690 --> 03:58:42,630
Bum, bum, bum, bum.

2928
03:58:44,750 --> 03:58:47,330
And a man just stopped, and he started to smile.

2929
03:58:47,490 --> 03:58:48,430
He started to laugh.

2930
03:58:48,630 --> 03:58:49,710
He laughed for a while.

2931
03:58:49,990 --> 03:58:52,290
He said, come on, duck, let's walk to the store.

2932
03:58:52,570 --> 03:58:55,310
I'll buy you some grapes, so you won't have to ask any more.

2933
03:58:57,370 --> 03:58:59,990
So they walked to the store, and the man bought some grapes.

2934
03:59:00,210 --> 03:59:03,750
He gave one to the duck, and the duck said, Hmm, no thanks.

2935
03:59:04,470 --> 03:59:05,950
We know what sounds good.

2936
03:59:06,090 --> 03:59:09,090
It would make my day.

2937
03:59:10,450 --> 03:59:11,690
Do you think the store?

2938
03:59:12,970 --> 03:59:14,290
Do you think the store?

2939
03:59:15,550 --> 03:59:19,090
Do you think the store has any lemonade?

2940
03:59:20,370 --> 03:59:22,010
Then he watered away, water, water.

2941
03:59:22,650 --> 03:59:24,950
Then he watered away, water, water.

2942
03:59:29,810 --> 03:59:34,470
Yeah, he was the original rage baiter.

2943
03:59:38,410 --> 03:59:49,510
Wada wada And he walked away Wada wada I figured I always sing that song In Sunstream I'm always like Then he walked away Wada wada

03:59:52,870 --> 03:59:54,930

04:00:10,870 --> 04:00:12,130
I actually don't know this song.

2949
04:00:12,550 --> 04:00:13,910
Casper the friendly ghost.

2950
04:00:14,210 --> 04:00:15,550
I've watched Casper.

2951
04:00:15,690 --> 04:00:16,850
I didn't know it had a song.

2952
04:00:18,450 --> 04:00:21,110
Bro, I would sing Garfield theme song if it was in here.

2953
04:00:21,610 --> 04:00:24,410
How the fuck do you sing the Casper theme song?

2954
04:00:25,410 --> 04:00:28,730
Casper the friendly ghost, the friendliest ghost you know.

2955
04:00:28,950 --> 04:00:29,790

I have never heard of this song before.

2958
04:00:38,170 --> 04:00:41,690
I'm just here like, Casper, the friendly ghost.

2959
04:00:41,870 --> 04:00:43,090

04:01:09,950 --> 04:01:12,970
They're a hero, they hatch out, and they're green.

2967
04:01:14,890 --> 04:01:19,690
When the evil Shredder attacks, these turtle boys don't cut him no slack.

2968
04:01:20,250 --> 04:01:28,750
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Splinter taught them to be Ninja Teens.

2969
04:01:29,070 --> 04:01:30,130
He's a radical rat.

2970
04:01:30,570 --> 04:01:33,670
Leonardo leaves, Donald Trump does machines.

2971
04:01:36,090 --> 04:01:37,590
That's cool but rude.

2972
04:01:38,050 --> 04:01:40,650
But Michelangelo is a party dude.

2973
04:01:40,990 --> 04:01:43,190
Teenage mutant ninja turtles.

2974
04:01:43,610 --> 04:01:45,770

To like.

2980
04:01:57,250 --> 04:01:59,210
Let's just sing cartoon songs.

2981
04:01:59,950 --> 04:02:01,770
They're the extra spooky.

2982
04:02:02,250 --> 04:02:02,670
They're.

2983
04:02:06,190 --> 04:02:07,810

2984
04:02:07,990 --> 04:02:12,150
Oh, guys, guys, I know what I want to sing next.

04:02:15,570 --> 04:02:17,190

04:02:17,630 --> 04:02:20,230
And I was like, that's a good song.

2988
04:02:20,810 --> 04:02:23,310
And I will end it with this song.

2989
04:02:23,550 --> 04:02:24,510
And that's that.

2990
04:02:24,770 --> 04:02:25,470
What is this?

2992
04:02:26,010 --> 04:02:28,210
Oh, wait, actually, no, this is not the song I'm ending it with.

2993
04:02:28,670 --> 04:02:31,390
But I saw another thing on here.

yeah it's squirrels in my pants that's what simp originally meant when people were like are you a simp it means do you have do you have squirrels in your pants okay jk i'll do one more that shouldn't be the song we ended with that

3041
04:07:21,790 --> 04:07:34,430
I have never, by the way, guys, I know I sang that song, but I have no idea why that song is so popular.

3042
04:07:34,890 --> 04:07:44,550
I know people are like, it's like My Little Pony where adults actually love Phineas and Ferb, but I've only watched three episodes of that show.

3043
04:07:44,710 --> 04:07:45,750
I know the context.

3044
04:07:48,960 --> 04:07:51,080
I know, like, I know the songs.

3045
04:07:51,280 --> 04:07:57,320
I've watched the songs and the music videos from the show, the good songs.

3046
04:07:57,760 --> 04:08:01,220
And I know, like, I know, Perry the Platypus.

3047
04:08:04,480 --> 04:08:06,200
Perry, random Platypus.

3048
04:08:06,600 --> 04:08:07,660
Perry the Platypus.

3049
04:08:08,900 --> 04:08:10,680
Yeah, it has decent songs.

3050
04:08:10,900 --> 04:08:12,540
I just don't know much about it.

3051
04:08:15,380 --> 04:08:15,900
Um...

3052
04:08:18,460 --> 04:08:19,020
Perry?

3053
04:08:20,080 --> 04:08:21,020
Perry the platypus.

3054
04:08:23,560 --> 04:08:25,180
I like the little...

3055
04:08:27,380 --> 04:08:27,940
The...

3056
04:08:29,740 --> 04:08:30,300
The...

3057
04:08:30,300 --> 04:08:31,140
The...

3058
04:08:31,140 --> 04:08:32,760
What was it?

3059
04:08:32,960 --> 04:08:35,580
The Creator's YouTube channel was pretty funny.

3060
04:08:37,940 --> 04:08:40,360
I don't know what song to end it on.

3061
04:08:41,200 --> 04:08:42,480
Like, do I do a real song?

3062
04:08:42,620 --> 04:08:43,940
Or do I do like a...

3063
04:08:43,940 --> 04:08:45,820
I do a shit post.

3064
04:08:46,300 --> 04:08:47,060
I don't know.

3065
04:08:47,320 --> 04:08:48,020
I don't know.

3066
04:08:53,300 --> 04:08:55,340
It's so hard sometimes.

3067
04:08:55,640 --> 04:08:56,580
Life is so hard.

3068
04:09:01,630 --> 04:09:02,590
But I'm...

3069
04:09:06,050 --> 04:09:11,350
This, actually, to be fair, the entire karaoke has been my shitpost, I would say.

3070
04:09:16,340 --> 04:09:18,080
I was saying something I know how to sing.

3071
04:09:18,720 --> 04:09:20,460
It's like, that was the first time I sang.

3072
04:09:21,560 --> 04:09:22,800
Squirrels in my pants.

3073
04:09:26,880 --> 04:09:58,740

What's going on, Natalie?

3084
04:11:22,370 --> 04:11:23,770
To drink and fight.

3085
04:11:25,030 --> 04:11:26,570
It's a fuck all night.

3086
04:11:26,890 --> 04:11:29,410
Don't test me when I'm crazy on that airplane glue.

3087
04:11:29,610 --> 04:11:32,190
Put my foot down your throat till you shit in my shoe.

3088
04:11:32,350 --> 04:11:33,230
Leave you screaming.

3089
04:11:33,650 --> 04:11:34,850
Pay for my dry cleaning.

3090
04:11:35,530 --> 04:11:36,270
Fuck your madness.

3091
04:11:36,490 --> 04:11:38,070
It's my name that I'm screaming.

3092
04:11:38,610 --> 04:11:39,410
I'm sorry, Natalie.

3093
04:11:39,610 --> 04:11:42,670
Are we to believe that you continue driving while intoxicated?

3094
04:11:43,490 --> 04:11:45,210
I never said I was a role model.

3095
04:11:45,330 --> 04:11:46,750
Wait, what about the kids who look up to me?

3096
04:11:46,890 --> 04:11:48,290
Do you have a message for them?

3097
04:11:49,090 --> 04:11:52,050
All the kids looking up to me can suck my dick.

3098
04:11:52,270 --> 04:11:53,410
It's poor man, motherfucker.

3099
04:11:53,750 --> 04:11:54,870
Drink till I'm sick.

3100
04:11:55,030 --> 04:11:57,490
Slick your throat and pour a nitrous down the hole.

3101
04:11:57,810 --> 04:12:00,390
Watch you laugh and cry while I laugh you die.

3102
04:12:00,630 --> 04:12:03,270
And all the dudes, you know I'm talking to you.

3103
04:12:03,470 --> 04:12:04,430
We love you, Natalie.

3104
04:12:04,630 --> 04:12:06,290
I am fuck you too.

3105
04:12:06,890 --> 04:12:07,770
It's for Portman.

3106
04:12:08,290 --> 04:12:09,010
It's for pussy.

3107
04:12:09,170 --> 04:12:12,190
I'll kill your fucking dog for fun so don't push me.

3108
04:12:12,370 --> 04:12:17,310
Well, Natalie, I'm surprised all of this from a Harvard graduate.

3109
04:12:17,970 --> 04:12:20,250
Well, there's a lot you may not know about me.

3110
04:12:21,450 --> 04:12:22,350
Such as?

3111
04:12:25,030 --> 04:12:25,850
weed every day.

3112
04:12:26,070 --> 04:12:28,610
I cheated every test and snorted on the yay.

3113
04:12:29,030 --> 04:12:30,150
I got a dead posse.

3114
04:12:30,310 --> 04:12:31,530
You got a bunch of dudes.

3115
04:12:31,770 --> 04:12:34,570
I sit right down in your face and take a shit.

3116
04:12:34,790 --> 04:12:39,110
Natalie, you're all a badass bitch.

3117
04:12:39,910 --> 04:12:40,490
Hell yeah.

3118
04:12:40,770 --> 04:12:45,110
I always pay for your dry cleaning when my shit gets in your shoes.

3119
04:12:45,330 --> 04:12:45,730
What?

3120
04:12:46,370 --> 04:12:48,130
I ask for the drug use.

3121
04:12:48,490 --> 04:12:50,530
Well, I can vouch for that.

3122
04:12:51,190 --> 04:12:54,430
My dick is scared of you.

3123
04:12:55,430 --> 04:12:56,070
Girl!

3124
04:12:58,010 --> 04:12:59,290
Okie doke.

3125
04:12:59,850 --> 04:13:01,170
Natalie, one final question.

3126
04:13:01,570 --> 04:13:06,030
If you could steal a smooch from any guy in Hollywood, who would it...

3127
04:13:06,550 --> 04:13:08,470
No more questions.

3128
04:13:15,550 --> 04:13:18,530
Okay, I was listening to a song literally yesterday.

3129
04:13:20,450 --> 04:13:22,190
I was just like, wait, they have this?

3130
04:13:22,590 --> 04:13:23,770
It's a lonely island.

3131
04:13:23,890 --> 04:13:25,010
There's a sequel to it.

3132
04:13:25,030 --> 04:13:26,810
Seriously from Natalie Portman.

3133
04:13:26,990 --> 04:13:27,850
Doki, no.

3134
04:13:28,790 --> 04:13:29,030
No.

3135
04:13:29,650 --> 04:13:30,090
No.

3136
04:13:31,130 --> 04:13:33,110
I was listening to this like yesterday.

3137
04:13:35,910 --> 04:13:37,850
You guys know who Natalie Portman is.

3138
04:13:38,250 --> 04:13:39,910
He'd be like, what the fuck?

3139
04:13:40,710 --> 04:13:42,890
That's why I was like, wait, oh shit, they had this?

3140
04:13:42,990 --> 04:13:43,770
I was saying this.

3141
04:13:44,370 --> 04:13:45,490
This is a good thing.

3142
04:13:49,550 --> 04:13:50,910
I love the island.

3143
04:13:51,090 --> 04:13:52,210
Okay, we're not ending with that.

3144
04:13:52,410 --> 04:13:52,750
I'm sorry.

3145
04:13:52,910 --> 04:13:54,250

3147
04:13:55,030 --> 04:13:56,390
People are going to clip that.

04:13:58,730 --> 04:14:00,570
I'm sorry I had to.

3149
04:14:00,690 --> 04:14:01,510
I'm sorry.

3150
04:14:02,050 --> 04:14:06,570
I saw this on and out of your clip and out of context.

3151
04:14:07,570 --> 04:14:08,990
It just sucked.

3152
04:14:11,810 --> 04:14:13,270

3153
04:14:13,370 --> 04:14:15,050

Then the Vaude would have lived.

3163
04:15:34,970 --> 04:15:38,330
The Vaude would have lived if I stopped an hour ago.

3164
04:15:38,430 --> 04:15:39,070
I'm sorry.

3165
04:15:41,190 --> 04:15:46,150
If I kept fighting Sands, everything would have been okay.

If I kept fighting Sands.

3167
04:15:51,630 --> 04:15:53,690
No, I can't end it on that.

04:15:53,710 --> 04:15:55,130
At least wrap, guys.

3169
04:15:55,250 --> 04:15:57,030

I don't know what song to end it on.

3174
04:16:42,710 --> 04:16:44,550
It's hard to find the last song.

3175
04:16:45,170 --> 04:16:46,230
I might go do a classic.

3176
04:16:51,890 --> 04:16:52,950

04:16:54,070 --> 04:16:55,970

Oh my god.

3189
04:18:25,670 --> 04:18:27,990
Oh, it went very hard.

3190
04:18:28,210 --> 04:18:30,510
I was dumbed down to listen.

3191
04:18:33,150 --> 04:18:34,890
And that book's not so easy.

3192
04:18:35,250 --> 04:18:43,770
Around the world, around the world, around the world, around the world, like I'm just just that.

04:18:47,250 --> 04:18:53,290
Around the world, around the world, and it's like for five fucking minutes.

04:19:00,130 --> 04:19:02,590
Bum-bity-bop-dee-boop.

04:20:00,050 --> 04:20:00,770
That's not it.

3200
04:20:01,010 --> 04:20:02,130
That's a whole new world.

3201
04:20:03,630 --> 04:20:04,990
Yeah, part of you, man.

3202
04:20:07,390 --> 04:20:08,470

3225
04:22:28,060 --> 04:22:32,940
up where they run, up where they stay all day in the sun.

3226
04:22:33,580 --> 04:22:39,700
Wondering free, wish I could be part of that world.

3227
04:22:40,680 --> 04:22:45,960
Where would I give if I could live out of these waters?

3228
04:22:46,820 --> 04:22:51,860
What would I pay to spend a day warm on the sand?

3229
04:22:55,260 --> 04:23:27,280
understand that they don't reprimand their daughters right young cats sick of swimming ready to stand ready to know what the people know asking my questions and get some answers what's a fire and why does it what's the word burn when's it When I love,

3230
04:23:27,840 --> 04:23:47,020
love to explore that shore up above Out of the sea I wish I could be Part of that world

3231
04:23:50,730 --> 04:23:56,250
You know, like, the song would be much more meaningful if I wasn't fucking Garfield

3232
04:24:03,950 --> 04:24:12,330
It would, it would like, if I wasn't Garfield, it would make, it would like, I don't know, it would be less weird.

3239
04:24:45,900 --> 04:24:50,160
My intrusive thoughts were like, my rational side was like, you shouldn't sing that on stream.

3240
04:24:50,320 --> 04:24:52,280
But then my intrusive thoughts like, do it, you bitch.
