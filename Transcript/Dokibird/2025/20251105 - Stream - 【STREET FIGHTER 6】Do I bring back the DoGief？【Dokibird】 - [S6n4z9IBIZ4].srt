1
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,530
Oh, um, well, this is awkward.

2
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,230
I'm, uh, apricadabra, I'm gone.

3
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,490
Okay, I forgot.

4
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,510
I knew I forgot about something.

5
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:59,130
I, I was like, hmm, am I forgetting something?

6
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,530
Whoa, abracadabra, I'm back.

7
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:08,230
Abracadabra, ooh, ooh, la, la, la, la.

8
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:12,110
My, what do you mean you're immersion?

9
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,770
I even said the magic word.

10
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,370
I was like, yeah, close my door.

11
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:20,340
Any type of muffling is good with me.

12
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,830
Zander, welcome to the tomato farm.

13
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,910
Welcome, welcome, guys.

14
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,010
But yeah, no, sorry.

15
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:47,350
was i swear it's a conspiracy i literally got on my pc i was like that was a good walk for for dad let me get on the pc and then i got like six messages and i was like oh i

16
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,560
was like oh

17
00:04:56,480 --> 00:06:06,520
so so i had to answer all of that um i am a busy a busy a busy girl this week so busy yeah but first up I do want to say um thank you guys all for the support as always I'm really happy to do things I can do and want to do because of you guys and I can keep going because of all of your support so it really does mean a lot everybody uh thank you guys so much for all the support uh throughout my journey everyone um but yeah um anyway so today we are back back with Street Fighter 6 and I will have to let you guys know the last time I touched Street Fighter 6 was um last year when we did say gem slam that was a long time ago um so nephew isn't coming in until an hour so like at 2 p.m so it's just you and I chat it's just you and me um I should have asked him I mean I should have started my stream at 2 uh but You know,

18
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:15,820
I figured, because, like, apparently all of us are starting at 1, regarding the training session, because, hey, Capcom, I don't know if Capcom's going to swap to me.

19
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:21,380
They might be watching someone else right now, but, like, hey, Capcom, our stream will be on Capcom's channel.

20
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,360
I think it's, I don't know if it's, like, Capcom's, it's like the Street Fighter.

21
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,000
Oh, yeah, it is on, it's going to be on Capcom Fighter.

22
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,100
Oh, thank God, they're not watching me yet.

23
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:36,220
But at 2 p.m., they might swap.

24
00:06:36,240 --> 00:07:32,360
to me uh later on so like that's why like i don't know when they're swapping to me there it's gonna happen i don't know it will happen somehow in some way uh we're gonna be that's why i have to i have to start at one uh so uh so that's why i'm here early uh but enough he's coming in on 2 p.m and he's gonna help me figure out what the fuck to play because like i said i am stuck for those who don't know all right so i forgot to tell the story on my youtube channel because i told it on twitch um because like you know i was playing rivals at four in the morning as one will be uh as one should be you know i dropped the bomb uh before my schedule was posted i like dropped the bomb and was like hey guys i'm gonna like um i'm these are my coaches for by the for

25
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,620
So basically, we are stuck between two characters.

26
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:50,200
Because for those who don't follow the, you know, Street Fighter patches, Zangief has gotten nerfed since the last time I played him.

27
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:56,140
Which is, you know, it's crazy to think about how dare they change my character after I haven't touched him for a year.

28
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,100
Like, what the fuck is this?

29
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,100
Like, how dare they?

30
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:05,900
It should be the same character after a year.

31
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,820
How fucking dare they nerf him?

32
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:24,560
So, um, so, um, this is what I was told by Justin, um, you know, Mr. Juan, um, because he was saying, yeah, he did get nerfed.

33
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:29,140
So, uh, not sure if you still want to keep playing Zen Keefe.

34
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:35,980
And then, so, you know, I had this conversation with Nephew about this because he's like my main coach for this entire tournament.

35
00:08:36,620 --> 00:09:32,470
um and the tournament is on friday um and the entire tournament is on friday by the way it's not like stage i'm slam where we had the group like we had like you know the group stages on different days and then the finals on you know there's like two groups like there's like two days where it's group stages and then the third day is the finals this time it's like all is on one day so you can't really adapt to anything um so like what you get is what you get type deal so i also have you know my participation was announced a week ago i haven't touched street fighter this is going to be i mean i did touch street fighter yesterday a little bit but like you know i was going through the controls i was like i don't know what the i'm doing like i was like trying to go through the controls myself and like going through like the combo trials i was like i don't remember any of this and i don't even know what the i did none of these instructions make any sense to me um and I was going through like

36
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:36,310
Zangif and Honda and I was like none of these make sense to me.

37
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,770
It's not coming back.

38
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,090
Oh no.

39
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:44,430
I was like, oh no, it's not coming back.

40
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,770
It's not like riding a bicycle.

41
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,810
I was lied to.

42
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,210
Because I know like, no way.

43
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:56,730
When you get into the game and you start, you know, pressing the controls, it'll come back to you.

44
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:57,770
It did not.

45
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,850
It did not come back to me.

46
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:06,750
I was just like, oh no, no, this is bad.

47
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:09,890
I thought, like, you know, at least the same game I could, like, remember.

48
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,570
It did not happen.

49
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,370
I did not remember anything.

50
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:17,090
The bike is fighting back me right now.

51
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:26,990
So, so, so I don't fucking know how we're going to go through this without nephew for a bit.

52
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:34,750
And so anyway, so, you know, know, I was talking to nephew being like, what the fuck do I play?

53
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,750
Like, you know, as one should.

54
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:41,910
And yes, now know why, like, there's so many things going on last week.

55
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:47,610
There was no time for me to, like, even boot up Street Fighter with everything going on.

56
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:55,450
And like, you know, with like stuff I, you know, I had to like, you know, I was just catching up with people and all that stuff going on and all of that.

57
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,990
And then why I had to go to sleep.

58
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:26,530
So like, I was just going straight and all that shit so I was so busy last week in prep and in preparation to this this was like today was like you know yesterday was like the first day I got to actually touch the game and even then I was like what the fuck am I do I don't remember and I was like oh no why can't I remember I thought it was riding a bicycle I

59
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:33,070
I'll read what I said to Nephew.

60
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:41,870
Basically, I was like, or I'm looking through my messages to Nephew.

61
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:50,170
And I was like, I just want to play something that's easiest to abuse and make people the most angry.

62
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:54,950
Because Nephew was like, you can keep playing Zangip if you like them.

63
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:57,230
And I was like, I don't care.

64
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:00,970
I don't care.

65
00:12:01,130 --> 00:13:01,990
give me the most easy character and something that can rage rage bait people i don't care who it is like so he was like oh oh um he's like oh saying keep is pretty good at that but like uh honda and then so that's why nephew was like you should try honda then because apparently he has this one combo that's just one button that's the most easily abusive so he's like and I was like yeah I I and then he's like and he's like oh but you could also learn JP and but then he was also like but I don't think you should learn JP because because it can get a little overwhelming for a new player which I I infer as super like you might be too stupid for JP and I agree I agree because I later said uh yeah I I was like I was like I can only know I can learn four moves.

66
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,790
I straight up was like, I can only learn four moves.

67
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:07,370
If you give me anything else, it's over.

68
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,510
It's GG's.

69
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,590
Like, because that's how I learned King.

70
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,550
And, um, yeah, he requires a Brit.

71
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:18,650
And like, even nephew before he was like, try JP is like, I don't think you should try JP.

72
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:22,870
He's like, JP is also one, but I don't think you should try JP.

73
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:38,230
because he's like jp tilts because he was saying like he was saying like what was it i like this guy he's like uh uh

74
00:13:43,710 --> 00:15:13,080
oh my god where is this comment it was basically like honda makes people angry at low elo but jp can make any elo but then even then he's like i don't think you should learn jp like so so so i was like you're you're so right um but yeah uh because i'm like i i you don't understand like i i when i play zane gif and i play king um i just learned king it was two moves i'm pretty sure i learned two moves and then it was just free for all um so that's why like i was so unpredictable because i didn't know what i was actually doing on king and he was taken as much more button mashing friendly come but then like in street fighter in street fighter uh it was different because you can't oh and the low yeah the low kick was like my saving grace uh because like you know like the actual real players don't fucking think you would abuse the low kick because who the fuck does that i do that but like who the fuck does that i do it um um but like for a street fighter um it's a different story uh because

75
00:15:13,080 --> 00:16:22,820
you can't really button mesh so you actually have to know exactly what the fuck you're doing uh because you're like there's no way there's no way she's gonna low kick again but I'll use it there's no way she'll use that low kick again but there is a way because for me I abuse it until it stops working and it kept working because they're like there's no way she'll do it again but I still kept doing it because they think I won't do it again because it's like the most stupid thing you can do anyway in Street Fighter uh uh yeah it's like when i kept using rock because they're like there's no way she's gonna pull out rock for the fifth time but i still i'm like rock the street fighter i actually have to know more moves um um and so that's why zanke was really good for me because all i had to do was just walk up to them and grab like it was just different forms of me up to them and grabbing them.

76
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,480
I'm like, oh, do I walk over there slowly?

77
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,560
Or do I walk over there really fast?

78
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:33,940
Or do I wait for them to jump at me and then I jump and grab?

79
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,500
Like, that's it.

80
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,120
That was my entire game plan on saying keep.

81
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,640
I literally was like, how do I grab you?

82
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,460
Like, nothing else.

83
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,700
Maybe I'll throw in a slap or two.

84
00:16:46,080 --> 00:17:47,720
But majority of that was like, do I walk slowly or do I walk over really fast or do i like wait like but anyway i talked to also big bird from um you know big bird from also from street fighter he is my secret coach um that i didn't reveal until like the schedule was out because i'm collecting all the you know we're in the bird family you know got birds got to stick together so uh i won't now i almost have all the birds i'm just missing angry bird uh so in tomorrow to also coach me but i also talked to him too i was like what do you think should i also should what do you what character should i learn and even big bird was like you should try honda like it might be like the easiest and like the most abusable to pick up on so big bird and nephew both suggested honda that's why i'm conflicted right now so i don't know we're gonna stick with dogeef or we're gonna do do honda so we're today is the day where we figure

85
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,340
to stuff all this knowledge in this very tiny brain.

86
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,460
But, like, I think we can do it.

87
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:10,640
Like, it's just, the thing is, Honda apparently, like I said, he has only one move that's very easily abusable, one combo that's very easily abusable, and you just have to press one button.

88
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,500
And I like that, you know?

89
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,000
I really like that.

90
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,200
One button, not two, one.

91
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,580
Like, I can't fuck that up.

92
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,160
If anything, I just need a...

93
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,540
The second button would be me moving forward.

94
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,720
So I'm thinking like...

95
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,780
One button seems really, really doable, guys.

96
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,560
I don't know.

97
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:41,040
That one button just sounds so appealing to me.

98
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:50,700
Nephew did say it might take a bit for me to like understand Han.

99
00:18:50,720 --> 00:19:16,380
as well because like yeah he said it requires charge moves I was like what the fuck is a charge I was like does that like am I charging like am I holding the button down like is that what you mean by charge move also I told him that he has to talk to me in like controller icons like I if he's like use heavy attack I'd be like what the fuck are you talking about is that x like

100
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,520
via PlayStation controller buttons, icons.

101
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,860
Because the icons are on my controller.

102
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,440
So that's how I know what to press.

103
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:38,620
So you might, some of the guys who are new here, who haven't watched my fighting game art before, I looked down.

104
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,720
I actually looked down on my controller.

105
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:50,400
Because when I was being taught how to play Zangief, when I was being taught how to play Zangief, and they were like, remember to use...

106
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,040
R2.

107
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,940
Remember to use like special heavy.

108
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,480
And I was like special heavy.

109
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,020
And he'll be like R2 triangle.

110
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,200
And I'm like, oh, R2 triangle.

111
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,520
I'll be like, yeah.

112
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,200
Nexi.

113
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,920

Perfect for Doki.

118
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,040
Exactly.

119
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,700
Less numbers means maybe.

120
00:20:20,720 --> 00:21:21,240

He was like, disgusting.

123
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,800
He was literally like, the next comment was like, sorry, I can't help you anymore.

124
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,100
Because it's like, I'm a, I'm a body player.

Thank you.

Thank you.

129
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,420

Tomorrow's my birthday.

131
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,760
Can I get an early happy birthday from my Kami Oshi?

132
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,020

137
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,520
I'm not even the fucking blob in Digimon.

138
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,580
I'm the egg.

139
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,040
I'm the egg.

140
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,060
You ain't gonna teach an egg a classic controller, guys.

141
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,840
You ain't teaching this egg anything.

142
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,600
She's not taking it in.

143
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:41,760
All right.

144
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,400
Let me boot up this game real quick.

145
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,440
Street Fighter 6.

146
00:22:50,720 --> 00:23:04,860
I got really scary because when I was like, when I plugged in my controller for the game, it started making beep, beep, beep, beep, and then I panicked and unplugged my controller because I think my PC was actually going to blue screen if I kept it in a little longer.

147
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:11,880
So I hope my, I hope my FG, like my fighting game controller would be okay.

148
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,960
Because that worried me a little bit.

149
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:47,620
Street Fighter 6 Street Fighter 6 Alright let me get the Street Fighter in Oh my god It's been so long since I've seen this It's oh my god It's been so long since I've seen this screen I have not seen my sound guy Talk at all so I'm a little worried Which one is it?

150
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:53,760
It's the Razer one It's not the What is it called the Was it about the junkie?

151
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,240
Is it the junkie?

152
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,140
I don't remember the other brand.

153
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,760
It's the Razor one.

154
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,440
Because this is the...

155
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,240
Oh, the snack box.

156
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,220
Yeah, the snack box.

157
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,460
It's not the snack box.

158
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,700
Because the only reason why I haven't used the snack box one.

159
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,480
Is because it doesn't have the...

160
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,740
Oh, it's junk food.

161
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:20,220
It doesn't have the controller icons on the controller.

162
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,260
No.

163
00:24:23,160 --> 00:25:14,200
like I mean I could get a marker and draw the icon on it no no okay I gotta feed him a little bit he's a little bit of a bratty yeah so and I keep telling myself okay if I have more time I can learn it without seeing the controller icons on my um on the controller but I never really had always had the time um to actually like uh learn the controller because this is the same controller i've been using since the very first stage am slam um for techin so so my brain has never processed what button does what i just know i just look at the controller icons uh back

164
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:49,550
even this food

165
00:25:55,930 --> 00:27:03,910
oh yeah i don't even know where light punches that you can tell you can speak in color like i know like some people are like oh it's the blue button i'm like what the fuck is the blue button my controller is black like in my in the snack boxes is white colored like i don't know what the you're talking about for blue button or red button like that makes zero sense to me all right okay why is my controller not registering hello hello okay let me pre-plug this oh oh there we go oh my god okay i'm like i don't know what i'm doing all right so okay so it just i just need you to know i did try to see if i remember zangief and i will say i definitely did not

166
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:55,330
because they're like oh why learn a new character wouldn't it be easy to just try and remember everything else and i was like if it was not easier it was not easier i might as well start from zero all right i might as well um oh yeah okay so also when i told my thumbnail maker like oh yeah um i would be doing a coaching session with nephew at first she wrote um She wrote on the thumbnail Coaching my nephew She thought I was She thought I was actually coaching a nephew out of play street fighting.

167
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:59,290
I was like no no no That's his name

168
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:13,170
No, that's his actual name and I'm not coaching my nephew Okay.

169
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:15,090
Okay.

170
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:19,210
I did look up this, though.

171
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:23,470
But why is it who's saying my loyal fans?

172
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,430
I was so confused.

173
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:28,830
I was like, I thought you said my loyal fans.

174
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:31,790
But that's the only thing I looked up.

175
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,950
I was like, I need to know how to do this.

176
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:36,210
My loyal fans.

177
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:39,690
But I'm confused.

178
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:41,850
Oh, I have to be low HP.

179
00:28:43,610 --> 00:29:02,330

00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:18,010

182
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,390
I don't even know.

183
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,730
Like, I heard his damage.

184
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:24,450
He got nerfed.

185
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:25,430
Yeah, no, oh my God.

186
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:26,510
It got nerfed a lot.

187
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:28,730
Oh, wait.

188
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,310
So that's this.

189
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:36,990
I feel like his damage did get nerfed, right?

190
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:38,430
Oh, wait.

191
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:39,390

192
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:41,550
Wait, not this.

193
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:41,870
Sorry.

194
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,310
How did I do it?

195
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,490
No, not like that.

196
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:46,050
Stop watching.

197
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,090
Stop watching.

198
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:47,810
Give me a sec.

199
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:49,250
I'm trying to figure this out.

200
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:52,090
Stop watching.

201
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:53,210
No, give me a sec.

202
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:55,410

203
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:57,590
It was so cool.

204
00:29:57,810 --> 00:30:00,090
Also, I think my sound guy is not alive.

205
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:01,070
Is it too loud?

206
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:02,570
Guys, is the game too loud?

207
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:03,870
I pushed it down a little.

208
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:07,170
I do have any mods alive.

209
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:10,290
Oh, shit.

210
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,010

Why did I never figure it out?

213
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:51,770
Why did I wait for him to wake up?

214
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:52,830
Yeah, look at that.

215
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:53,910
Look at that.

216
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:57,310
New tech unlocked that I'm going to forget at the actual game.

217
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,370
If I ever, like, get...

218
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:01,050
Like, I think that's cool.

219
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:04,230
I think this is cool.

220
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:08,710
Yeah, if it has to be the wall bounce or when, like...

221
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,710
When, like, uh, they jump to me.

222
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:12,510
Yeah, the...

223
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:14,190
Damage is so low, that's the thing.

224
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,970
That's the only thing that I don't like.

225
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:18,190
Like, look how little the damage is.

226
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:23,970
I would have, I would have fucking sent this man to the hospital after that one move.

227
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:24,590
Like,

228
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:31,970
that man should have been in the hospital, guys.

229
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:33,670
Like, you know, what?

230
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,730
So, like, I don't know if I like that.

231
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,890
So, yeah, I don't know.

232
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:43,130
I don't know.

233
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:44,570
I don't know if I'm gonna...

234
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,730
That's nearly everything I could remember.

235
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,850
Other than... I mean...

236
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:50,710
Yeah, no, that's actually... Wait, how do I do y'all?

237
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:54,010
How do I do y'all, guys?

238
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:57,870
Guys, how is it?

239
00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:59,350
What move was it?

240
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:00,550
Give me the...

241
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:01,510
The controller icon.

242
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:03,210
Give me...

243
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:07,270
What was the controller?

244
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:09,730
Oh, what the fuck is SPD?

245
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:10,370

246
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:13,690

249
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:17,050
No.

250
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:19,770
Um.

251
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:20,610
Triangle?

252
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:23,270
No.

253
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:24,110
Wait.

254
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:28,330
What is that?

255
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:30,210
How?

256
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:31,190
Speed?

257
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:32,890

267
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,190

00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,530
Oh, it's this.

275
00:32:59,150 --> 00:32:59,590

00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:00,550
Okay, it's triangle.

277
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:01,450
We figured it out.

278
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:02,210
It's triangle.

279
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:03,790

00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,930
Modern controls on a PlayStation.

286
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:20,230

That's literally it.

297
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,460
That's the extent of my knowledge.

298
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,260
Okay, now let's...

299
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,520
How do I swap characters?

300
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,680
Oh, return to characters to that.

301
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,820
Alright, that one.

302
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:51,820
Yeah, that's IHOP.

303
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,840
And now we have DoHonda.

304
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:57,260
Alright.

305
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,400
See, I told you guys.

306
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,040
This is how...

307
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,020
See, when...

308
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:03,040
The people who knew exactly how I processed...

309
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,760
Gap gave me the...

310
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,600
Instantly gave me the right controls.

311
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,720
They're like...

312
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:12,440
What the fuck is she talking about?

313
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:18,980
And the other, it's like one side is like, I don't understand what she wants us to say.

314
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,220
And the other one's like, back triangle.

315
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,060
And I'm like, that's my boy.

316
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,760
That's my boy.

317
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,520
You know what it's up.

318
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,220
All right, how do I play Honda?

319
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:41,800
All right, what are the, what are the, what are the PlayStation control buttons, guys?

320
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:46,360
Oh my god, why does it show, like, colors for...

321
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,360
Okay, give me a sec.

322
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:50,380
Control settings.

323
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,000
There we go.

324
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:54,100
That should be it, right?

325
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,140
Wait, because...

326
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:58,640
Wait, what?

327
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,860
Wait, how come it doesn't show?

328
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,920
I need you to show the PlayStation.

329
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,040
Oh, wait, command...

330
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,460
Wait, I want to make sure it shows...

331
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,120
controller icons.

332
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:15,880
It won't?

333
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,600
What do you mean it won't?

334
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:19,860
That's fucked.

335
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:20,460
What?

336
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,520
Say that?

337
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:24,680
Right here.

338
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,700
Isn't it here?

339
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,200
Yeah.

340
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,280
Show input.

341
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:34,900
Show it.

342
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,140
Yeah, I want to show input.

343
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,420
Why doesn't it show me?

344
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:43,110
Do I do like attack?

345
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:44,370
Is that what it is?

346
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:47,630
No, it's still colors.

347
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:48,350
Hello?

348
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:51,050
How am I supposed to realize what the fuck I'm doing?

349
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:56,030
Oh no, where is it?

350
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:57,490
That button.

351
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:00,090
I'm so confused.

352
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:02,490
Where's the doki option?

353
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:09,990
Where- Charge move, hold back, push forward, and attack.

354
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:12,070
What's the attack button?

355
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:14,130
Oh, is it the stream setting?

356
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:16,490
Wait, what does that mean?

357
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:19,550
What does that mean?

358
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:20,530
Where is that?

359
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:22,530
Attack?

360
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:22,930
Uh-oh.

361
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:23,450
Avatar?

362
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:24,210
Oh, no.

363
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:28,890
Any attack.

364
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:29,410
Oh, okay.

365
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:30,590
Yeah, what's the dokey?

366
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:31,910
Where's the dokey option?

367
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:33,250
So true.

368
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:35,670
I need it to be a dokey.

369
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:37,970
Where's the dokey accessibility here?

370
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:44,410
I wanted to show the icons on the left side.

371
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:48,250
I don't know what the fuck blue-yellow is?

372
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,190
you change it?

373
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:54,370
Um, if you change the one, it shows Xbox instead of controller.

374
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:56,250
That's why I have to choose that.

375
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:58,990
Is it in character select?

376
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,540
Well, I'll try.

377
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,200
No, that's not it.

378
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,960
That just tells me to do modern.

379
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,660
Oh, games should be a little louder.

380
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:15,080
Okay.

381
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:18,320
I'll boost it up a louder here.

382
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,800
All right, Let me know if it's better.

383
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,680
What do the colors mean?

384
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,560
What do they mean?

385
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,660
I know N means neutral.

386
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,660
Whatever that is.

387
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:35,060
But yellow, blue, SB for speed, red.

388
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,080
That makes no sense.

389
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:37,800
DI?

390
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:41,220
What am I fucking getting my DUI right now?

391
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,080
Being my license revoked?

392
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,560
Like, the colors.

393
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,440
What do they mean?

394
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,500
This?

395
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,460
Or...

396
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:55,560
Wait, how do I... How do I do the...

397
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,720
There we go, okay.

398
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,320
This one, right?

399
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,520
Is that the...

400
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,740
Hold for about one second.

401
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,520
Alright.

402
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,420
Left triangle.

403
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:14,660
Like that.

404
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,460
Do I just do this?

405
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,540
Also do the down triangle.

406
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:21,720
Oh.

407
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:24,340
Oh shit!

408
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:25,440
Okay.

409
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,980
That's the classic.

410
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:30,780
Alright, do that.

411
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,180
How come that...

412
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:33,880
What the fuck?

413
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,800
How come this one is not consistent?

414
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,420
Okay.

415
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,180
Okay.

416
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,140
It's like really weird.

417
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,820
It's not consistent.

418
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:54,450
It's not consistent at all.

419
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:58,090
It's like, like, if I stop, oh, wait, okay.

420
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:03,750
Yeah, see, if I stop, if I stop, oh, it requires a charge up.

421
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:08,570
How do I, what do you mean by, oh, yes, I can hold back.

422
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:09,150
Oh, okay.

423
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:13,350
Okay, so that's what he means by charge up.

424
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:16,510
I was like, what the fuck does nephew mean by charge up?

425
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:18,990
Okay.

426
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:20,090
All right.

427
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:23,170
So I just have to keep going back and then just do that.

428
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:23,890
Alright, what else?

429
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:25,010
What else do I have to learn?

430
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:28,550
Okay, that makes more sense now.

431
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:30,650
What else do I have to learn?

432
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:35,170
That's why it's the down charge up?

433
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:38,750
Like...

434
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:39,750
Is it charged up?

435
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:44,390
Is it... is it... is that charged?

436
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:49,230
Do you think it's charging?

437
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:50,430
Yeah.

438
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:53,810
Oh, down, up, charge.

439
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:55,710
Alright, like that?

440
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:57,650
You think it's charging?

441
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:03,910
Oh, press up and, uh, oh, press up and button after charging.

442
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,050
What the fuck?

443
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:07,370
Down to up?

444
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:11,130
Like that?

445
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,010
Like that?

446
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:16,890
No, okay, no.

447
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:19,690
Up plus, okay.

448
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:22,530
Oh, this!

449
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:23,970
Oh god, that is a lie.

450
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:26,330
So what is the combo?

451
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:26,860
Is it this?

452
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:31,170
Oh shit!

453
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:33,150
Wait, that shit goes high.

454
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:35,570
This is my auto.

455
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:38,290
Is that the auto?

456
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:39,130
The abuse?

457
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:40,670
No?

458
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:44,830
Don't wait.

459
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:46,750
He told me it's one button.

460
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:48,930
What is... Oh, what's the butt slab?

461
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:51,770
What's the butt slam?

462
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:55,290
People were saying butt slam is also really good.

463
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:03,390
Butt, stop, head butt.

464
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:04,890
Oh fuck, stop.

465
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:06,570
I have to stop?

466
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:14,010
Wait, what was the butt slam?

467
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:15,610
I did a butt slam?

468
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:20,650
Oh, this?

469
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:22,650
Is it that?

470
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:55,490

I would be like, time out!

00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:01,190
Time out!

474
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:05,490
Okay, now come closer.

475
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,970
Come closer, guys.

476
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:10,150
Okay.

477
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:14,330
All right.

478
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:16,850
Okay, this seems very hard to tap.

479
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:22,630
Okay, I'll be like, give me a sec!

480
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:25,950
Give me a sec.

481
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:28,510
Brother, I don't know.

482
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:29,950
Guys, I don't know anymore.

483
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:31,090

I think I'm cooked.

486
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:34,170
I have three days.

487
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:35,430
I think I'm cooked, guys.

488
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:39,870
We'll see if Nephew can salvage any of this.

489
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:42,930
He's going to grab some tape.

490
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:44,550
You know how, like...

491
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:47,230
You, like, you broke something...

492
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:48,650
You dropped something on the floor.

493
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:52,890
And he's going to grab a tape and just, like, grab all the pieces in his hand.

494
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:54,390
And just start taping it.

495
00:42:54,430 --> 00:43:35,490

497
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:56,890
It's not working as worth that.

498
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:58,590
What the fuck?

499
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:00,930
Why is it charging?

500
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:03,030
My kami-hami-ha isn't working.

501
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:06,010
Oh, okay.

502
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:06,630
Okay.

503
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:11,530
I have to, like, it has to be really fast.

504
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:13,530
Yeah.

505
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:15,690
I'm gonna timeout!

506
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:17,150
Oh my god.

507
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:18,070
Timeout again!

508
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:28,520

509
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:34,920

511
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:53,040
i'm like the the assurance.

512
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:57,720
Alright, is there anything else?

513
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:02,680
Well, he did quit.

514
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:06,580
I'll give him fond memories of his time working at Google.

515
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:18,320
I wish I could use the junk food snack box, but like, I need to grab a marker and actually draw a controller icons on it.

516
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,280
That's like the only way.

517
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:34,580
I Don't change, like, for me, when I remap buttons, I, like, I remap them based on what it's on, what are the controllers on the thing.

518
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:38,340
Like, not, like, the controllers itself being remapped.

519
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:40,880
All right.

520
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:42,840
You can headbutt people.

521
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,200
How do I headbutt people?

522
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:45,740
Or color it in.

523
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:46,960
Yeah, or color it in.

524
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:47,480
You're right.

525
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:48,720
Coloring might be easier.

526
00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:55,870
Thank you for the super chat.

527
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:56,170
Thank you.

528
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:56,830
Thank you.

529
00:45:57,210 --> 00:45:58,750
Hold down L1.

530
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:00,430
Wow.

531
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:01,810
Hold down.

532
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:03,450
Press triangle four times.

533
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:04,690
That is two buttons.

534
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:05,790
You can do it.

535
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:07,530
Oh, you mean my L2?

536
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:09,070
Wait, you mean my R2?

537
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:11,030
This?

538
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:13,150
Yeah, I re-binded that.

539
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:15,010
Is it this?

540
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:19,610
Is that what you're talking about?

541
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:23,010
Are you talking about my auto?

542
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:24,950
I don't know.

543
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:25,870
I don't know Angrius.

544
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:28,510
Because, like, L1 is my shield.

545
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:31,190
That's my shield.

546
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:33,610
Oh, do this as a chargeback?

547
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:36,370
Then...

548
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:37,990
Wait, that's not it.

549
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:38,910
That doesn't look right.

550
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:40,250
Is that what you're talking about?

551
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:44,010
Or is that what you're talking about?

552
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:46,290
No, L1.

553
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:46,750
Oh, yeah.

554
00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:47,210
Yeah, no.

555
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:48,370
That's R2.

556
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:50,370
R2 is my auto.

557
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:53,310
As you can see, watch my button mash.

558
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:56,470
surprised how fast I can press my...

559
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:01,770
Oh, okay.

560
00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:03,470
This and then...

561
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:06,250
Wait, this and...

562
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:06,630
That?

563
00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:07,110
Okay.

564
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:11,010
And...

565
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:13,210
Everyone's always so surprised.

566
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:15,650
But...

567
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:24,380
When I had to do a combo, when I had to do a combo on Zangief, it was like...

568
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:30,680
Looks like a good.

569
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,520
That's how fast.

570
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,340
Frame 1.

571
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:38,520
I'm doing frame 1 button matching.

572
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:45,900
Yeah, I'm surprised my controller has survived two stage-time slams and also this now.

573
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,260
Is the controller?

574
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,200
Okay.

575
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,360
Look, see?

576
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:50,300
Whoa!

577
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:51,360
Whoa!

578
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,340
That's how I play my fighting game.

579
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:57,360
Whoa.

580
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:02,840
Oh, well, I'm to the left, to the right, I'm shimmying.

581
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:06,700
My little, my AD, this is why I learned an FPS game.

582
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:12,680
They can't predict this if I'm AD strafing all the inputs.

583
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:15,440
Look at that.

584
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:22,020
Pat your S here, thank you for the super chat.

585
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,200
Thank you, thank you.

586
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:27,320
Instead of square, try X or O to charge your specialist light.

587
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:30,620
the X or O like this?

588
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:36,640
Wait, what's the difference between this and the other one?

589
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:38,240
Okay.

590
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:41,340
Alright.

591
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:46,680
Bob to the left can't hit me if I moved a little bit to the right.

592
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,080
Again.

593
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:51,060
Whoa.

594
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,840
Hades strafing in my fighting game.

595
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,080
Alright, what else?

596
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,500
What else should I learn?

597
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:05,080
The damage.

598
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,600
Oh, speed, damage, and distance changes?

599
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:11,760
Which one has the most damage?

600
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:14,540
Which button is the most damage?

601
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:14,920
Blue?

602
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:15,740
Which one's blue?

603
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:17,540
Blue.

604
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:18,120
Okay.

605
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:19,140
Square.

606
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,120
Alright, guys, this is how.

607
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,200
Blue is square?

608
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,360
Guys, blue is square.

609
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,380
Yellow is X.

610
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:27,960
Circle.

611
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:29,360
Oh, you guys remember.

612
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,400
And then speed is triangle.

613
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:38,340
Okay, so I assume circle does the most damage because that's the red, right?

614
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:39,960
All right.

615
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:41,940
So this would do more damage.

616
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:43,220
Really?

617
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:43,700
Does it?

618
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,640
Okay, head's a P. Oh, yeah, it does.

619
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:47,980
Now this one's A.

620
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:49,780
And this one's also A.

621
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:50,140
All right.

622
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,080
Red.

623
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:52,900
Red is O.

624
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:54,220
Or circle.

625
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:54,720
Sorry.

626
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:56,180
Oh, yeah.

627
00:49:56,180 --> 00:51:38,440

like um i i know that's a very stupid question but like i want to be Sure.

629
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:53,800
That is the light button, which you mean the square button.

630
00:51:54,340 --> 00:52:00,740
You mean the blue circle as in the square button or the blue circle as in the circle button.

631
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:03,940
I mean any attack.

632
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,280
Then why the fuck did you give me a blue circle?

633
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,180
You're frying the Doki GPU right now.

634
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,260
You're not, wait, no, the Doki CPU.

635
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,440
You are frying the Doki CPU.

636
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:18,000
GPU at the moment.

637
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:20,520
Okay.

638
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,360
That, as in, uh...

639
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:26,560
Didn't Brian make a video for you?

640
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,540
You sure did.

641
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,240
He sure.

642
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,360
Now you see why...

643
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:39,120
Why Nephew was like, we don't need to try JP.

644
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:40,920
I mean...

645
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:43,900
What doesn't hurt doesn't kill me.

646
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:44,580
Okay.

647
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:47,580
Wait, that's not JP.

648
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:50,240
Sorry, they were both old with beards.

649
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,840
It's easy to be confused with.

650
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:57,000
What doesn't... Hey!

651
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:59,560
Oh, wait, he should be ready.

652
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:00,100
Okay.

653
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,460
All right, he's ready whenever.

654
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:03,300
All right.

655
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:06,380
Let me make sure...

656
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:07,560
All right.

657
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:09,320
What the fuck?

658
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:12,160
How the fuck you set anything up?

659
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:14,980
All right.

660
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:17,660
That's enough.

661
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,360
I realize that's enough for me.

662
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:33,640
My brain was already overloaded.

663
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,240
I realize that it just wasn't it.

664
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:38,180
My arc is over.

665
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:39,720
It was a good practice, though.

666
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:40,540
It was...

667
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,060
It was a good practice.

668
00:53:49,880 --> 00:54:07,940

672
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:53,820
um you have to click the the one you're in first to leave it and then You have to click training.

673
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:57,640
I'm doing it.

674
00:57:06,450 --> 00:57:08,330
Oh, it's just day one, guys.

675
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:09,470
It's just day one.

676
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:11,330
Day two, it'll be better.

677
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:12,050
All right.

678
00:57:12,490 --> 00:57:14,390
Can I go on the left side?

679
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:15,090
Yay.

680
00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:16,750
Okay.

681
00:57:18,490 --> 00:57:19,010
Okay.

682
00:57:19,290 --> 00:57:23,810
So the core of your strategy is just going to be spamming headbutt and butt slam.

683
00:57:24,170 --> 00:57:24,490
Okay.

684
00:57:24,910 --> 00:57:25,190
All right.

685
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:29,650
So there is like an, so the easy way to do headbutt is you hold back.

686
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:33,430
back and do like your special let me turn on your inputs

687
00:57:37,190 --> 00:58:33,630
yeah yeah like that um and that and then if you want to do butt slam let's just charge down and then up yeah like i my chat was trying to teach me the butt slam but it's like it's so fast the input for it it's it should be the same as headbutt like you're getting it it's like yeah because sometimes i do that oh i see yeah you just have to just let go of down and press up really fast i guess oh okay yeah because it's not consistent for me for this one yeah maybe you could try like pressing up and punch with your with the same hand to make sure you get the time because the problem is you're pressing up like way earlier than the oh okay okay also how much how much time you have to do for charging it is that i i think it's like a little bit less than a second all right

688
00:58:40,050 --> 01:00:00,690
oh i'm getting it i'm figuring it out so it's just these two moves yeah if you can just keep spamming them that'd be that'd be really good i think okay yeah so just right after you do it you can start charging right again so you can do like you can basically do do another one right way after doing one oh yeah oh yeah also to make it easier to spam you could do like the special move button so you know how you have like a special move button yeah that's that's my the triangle wait the one the one you're pressing right now okay triangle okay um yeah if you if you just hold back and you press special okay yeah okay then you can just keep holding back so it it'll make it easier to spam too this one just does a bit less damage but it's fine you're able to just get charged better oh yeah no this is very easy to spam yeah yeah and then if you want to do the ex version you just hold auto to which is your that's my r2 yeah yeah so that one has a hit of armor but it's punishable but yeah um

689
01:00:00,690 --> 01:00:08,460
basically like you know me if you're a meter back okay so do one head but try to try to do like two headbuts in a row

690
01:00:12,510 --> 01:00:15,730
okay wait wait a minute

691
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:22,750
yeah but do do the regular ones not the x-arms okay

692
01:00:26,370 --> 01:00:28,950
uh i don't get why it doesn't charge that much

693
01:00:32,590 --> 01:00:39,130
So if you press, if you do the regular headbutt right away, like you'll get hit because like it's my turn after technically.

694
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:44,750
So normally we want to like wait a second after, but you can steal a turn with the EX one.

695
01:00:44,950 --> 01:00:49,530
So if you do like a regular headbutt into EX headbutt because it has armor, you'll blow through it.

696
01:00:50,530 --> 01:00:51,110
Like that.

697
01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:51,630
Oh!

698
01:00:52,730 --> 01:00:53,730
Wait, that's okay.

699
01:00:54,710 --> 01:00:58,150
Yeah, but if they call it out and they block the whole thing, then you're punishable.

700
01:00:59,170 --> 01:01:00,490
So I just have to do like a mix up.

701
01:01:01,310 --> 01:01:01,630
Yeah.

702
01:01:02,610 --> 01:01:15,150
Yeah, so I would say most of the time you just keep doing the regular one and then once in a while you can do the EX one But how do you counter the the the R2 triangle one?

703
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:17,990
The R this one?

704
01:01:20,030 --> 01:01:27,630
The speed you can just you just punish it after like after you block it then you just punish it It can also get grabbed.

705
01:01:28,010 --> 01:02:03,750
Yeah, but Yeah, the only downside really is that it's on safe oh yeah all right then you remember like oh about drive impact you're just driving back back that's all i was yeah okay so after you see it yeah yeah then after you get that um you just do your heavy auto combo do you remember how to do that um so you hold on so you hold i think um What is the R2?

706
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:05,050
Can you press R2?

707
01:02:05,050 --> 01:02:05,350
R2.

708
01:02:05,630 --> 01:02:06,030
Yeah.

709
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:08,910
Hold that and then mash, mash heavy.

710
01:02:09,090 --> 01:02:11,090
I don't know what that is.

711
01:02:11,950 --> 01:02:12,190
Yeah.

712
01:02:12,550 --> 01:02:12,790
Okay.

713
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:18,490
Yeah.

714
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:20,750
So that's pretty much going to be your main combo.

715
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:23,430
You just mash that out.

716
01:02:23,710 --> 01:02:23,990
All right.

717
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:28,270
So if you only have a level two, you can do your medium ones.

718
01:02:28,490 --> 01:02:34,450
So you just hold auto and do press your medium thing that's, um, Oh, that's square.

719
01:02:34,770 --> 01:02:35,390
Oh, square.

720
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:36,190
Okay.

721
01:02:36,190 --> 01:02:37,610
No, that's oh, no.

722
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:40,350
Oh, um, yeah, that one.

723
01:02:40,950 --> 01:02:42,250
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

724
01:02:43,310 --> 01:02:44,350
That's your level two.

725
01:02:46,610 --> 01:02:46,950
Yeah.

726
01:02:58,810 --> 01:03:03,030
So those are like the combos you want to do to cash out.

727
01:03:03,290 --> 01:03:06,670
If you're up close, you can also do like your auto light combo.

728
01:03:06,890 --> 01:03:08,770
So that one's you're with your square.

729
01:03:09,790 --> 01:03:10,770
Oh, that one.

730
01:03:10,890 --> 01:03:11,090
Yeah.

731
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:11,710
Yeah.

732
01:03:13,910 --> 01:04:13,250
so you can that one's safe so you can just do it whenever okay yeah but other than that let me see yeah so this move is a command grab so if you get up close you can command grab them something you could also do is you could yeah do like this one into a command grab oh is that oh it's this one okay yeah it's that one on block wait how do i oh it's how do you do that with that oh then wait how do i do that combo about you hold r2 oh oh okay yeah but you you don't want to do that last hit you see there you you like stop it yeah oh and then that okay yeah or other than that like any other time you get close you can do this oh so Just a triangle.

733
01:04:14,110 --> 01:04:17,510
Yeah, if you just see them blocking because they're scared, you can just walk up and do it.

734
01:04:17,890 --> 01:04:19,030
Oh, I see.

735
01:04:21,410 --> 01:04:21,410
I see.

736
01:04:24,510 --> 01:04:24,690
Oh.

737
01:04:25,850 --> 01:04:27,970
I tried to do this.

738
01:04:28,210 --> 01:04:28,870
I can't.

739
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:31,210
Yeah.

740
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:34,070
And...

741
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:35,710
Oh my god, it's so hard to do the butt stab.

742
01:04:39,370 --> 01:04:40,650
I'm like, not consistent.

743
01:04:41,530 --> 01:04:44,690
Yeah, I'm sure you can get consistent though by Friday.

744
01:04:45,530 --> 01:04:47,390
It just takes a bit of timing out.

745
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:55,770
I think the only problem is you're pressing the punch or the punch too early or too late.

746
01:04:55,830 --> 01:04:58,030
Too late after that.

747
01:05:04,870 --> 01:05:07,090
And sometimes you're not getting enough charge.

748
01:05:07,430 --> 01:05:09,150
But that one you press the punch too late.

749
01:05:12,910 --> 01:05:18,750
Yeah, and if you want to spam it, you have to right after you press it start charging down again.

750
01:05:19,490 --> 01:05:20,010
No!

751
01:05:21,390 --> 01:05:22,370
Good timing.

752
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:29,940
Okay.

753
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:33,440
I feel like I'm waiting too long.

754
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:35,100
Yeah, you're waiting, you're waiting.

755
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:36,700
I can show you where it's like.

756
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:39,760
Oh shit, you can do it that fast?

757
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:40,740
Yeah, yeah.

758
01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:41,980
Oh my god.

759
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:42,540
Okay.

760
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:45,620
Yeah.

761
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:46,060
Yeah.

762
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:48,000
What the fuck?

763
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:50,540
You're just waiting too long to start charging.

764
01:05:51,620 --> 01:05:53,540
Is the fuck you can do that?

765
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:59,760
Like as soon as you press the other two buttons and you start pressing down again by itself.

766
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:00,560
Yeah.

767
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:02,460
Oh my god.

768
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:07,400
Wait, give me a sec.

769
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:11,180
I guess we're good.

770
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:12,920
I don't think I don't know.

771
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:14,220
I don't know.

772
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:15,860
I mean we can we can take it.

773
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:25,860
we can save this for later but that's like yeah that's a trump card they'll never expect it yeah if you can get this one at least this one's already really good

774
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:45,220
what do i do after that again uh the heavy auto combo so it's you hold r2 it's uh the other one yeah so if you don't have level three it won't go into the level three you'll just get like the other parts of it but if you do have level three it'll cash out

775
01:06:48,460 --> 01:07:18,660
wait could you like after this kid you like break down all the buttons yeah i don't know if i'm processing this right now i the only thing i could remember right off my top of my head is this yeah sure i can write it down like can you um i need to i need to figure out which buttons are which for you so can you press yeah like all your buttons and tell me what they are so this is This is triangle.

776
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:21,320
This is X.

777
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:24,160
This is circle.

778
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:27,320
This is...

779
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:28,120
Wait, what is this?

780
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:30,760
This is drive impact.

781
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:31,480
Oh, DUI.

782
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:33,340
This is drive impact.

783
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:34,500
Okay.

784
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:39,380
Why is it not showing up on my left side?

785
01:07:40,180 --> 01:07:41,780
R2 is the...

786
01:07:41,780 --> 01:07:42,760
Oh, R2 is auto.

787
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:43,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

788
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:45,580
R2 is auto.

789
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,040
L1 is my block.

790
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:50,500
Uh-huh.

01:09:20,870 --> 01:09:22,590
Okay, it was time.

815
01:09:24,070 --> 01:09:28,090
So then, so you put, what, L3?

816
01:09:29,210 --> 01:09:29,390
Yeah.

817
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:31,410
Yeah, so this is your super button now.

818
01:09:31,930 --> 01:09:35,950
So if you're not, if you're knocked down especially, it's good to just wake up and do it.

819
01:09:35,990 --> 01:09:37,630
So you can just spam it when you wake up.

820
01:09:37,630 --> 01:09:37,950
Yeah.

821
01:09:37,950 --> 01:09:38,590
Because it's invincible.

822
01:09:40,290 --> 01:09:44,130
Something you can also do when you're knocked down is hold forward NDI to get dry reversal.

823
01:09:47,890 --> 01:09:50,630
Yeah, hold forward and drive him back.

824
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:53,270
Oh, I would this.

825
01:09:54,270 --> 01:09:57,390
Yeah, or you hold both of them while you're waking up.

826
01:09:57,630 --> 01:09:58,030
Oh, OK.

827
01:09:59,210 --> 01:10:01,390
Oh, OK.

828
01:10:01,390 --> 01:10:01,490
All right.

829
01:10:02,210 --> 01:10:04,810
It's only when you're knocked down, you start holding both of them.

830
01:10:06,590 --> 01:10:07,550
Oh, OK.

831
01:10:08,430 --> 01:10:09,310
I get it.

832
01:10:09,930 --> 01:10:14,830
Yeah, like you won't get it if you're like, so it's it's yeah, it's basically invincible.

833
01:10:14,950 --> 01:10:16,090
And then I try to hit you.

834
01:10:16,150 --> 01:10:18,670
Oh, yeah.

835
01:10:18,970 --> 01:10:20,730
But it costs two of your drive gauge bars.

836
01:10:20,870 --> 01:10:47,450
okay but that one's fine to do so you either do that or super if you if you really don't want to block uh-huh uh and then for anti-ring if you have charge you can just um do headbutt okay oh that's not what i want to do but that works you can just like wait and be like holding down back or back and use headbutt oh

837
01:10:55,190 --> 01:10:55,610
Yeah.

838
01:10:56,890 --> 01:10:57,670
I see.

839
01:10:58,590 --> 01:10:58,670
Oh.

840
01:10:59,490 --> 01:11:03,010
Yeah, you just have to make sure to time it a little bit for like right when I'm landing.

841
01:11:03,270 --> 01:11:04,930
So you still have the anti-armance ability.

842
01:11:06,310 --> 01:11:06,390
Yeah.

843
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:20,340
Are that?

844
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:21,700
Yeah.

845
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:23,040
How come sometimes you can hit me?

846
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,820
I think it's if you're doing it too early.

847
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:27,100
Oh, okay.

848
01:11:34,850 --> 01:11:35,270
Yeah.

849
01:11:35,270 --> 01:12:24,530
yeah that's the idea though you just keep spamming that how do you like counter this oh like when they just slap me okay okay yeah they have to they have to block one and then yeah yeah press a button after but a lot of new players won't even know when when it's their turn after so they might just get hit uh-huh so you just basically do this in the corner until they block me yeah how do i make do i by mixing it up i just do this like oh wait would you do like the just to mix it up yeah if they're blocking it you can do that to mix it up or if they're if they're like knocked down you can do your down special let me open up your down triangle oh down triangle okay yeah okay

850
01:12:32,230 --> 01:12:43,270
oh my it um

851
01:12:51,450 --> 01:13:20,530
yeah but you want to time it for like when i'm waking up at least yeah i want to just whip it oh hey okay so just when you're about to wake up like that yeah yeah that's perfect and then if you think they're gonna block you just stop doing that and you do your down triangle okay so just do that mix up on that Yeah,

852
01:13:20,870 --> 01:13:32,070
and then a lot of people will get start getting scared and doing Their drive impact so sometimes you can sometimes you can just wait for it like that'll work up close But okay, it's not gonna work.

853
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:41,830
So you just wait and you die back and then you get your heavy Your circle plus R2 What would I do after the drive impact?

854
01:13:42,070 --> 01:13:42,890
Oh the heavy the heavy.

855
01:13:43,490 --> 01:13:47,070
Yeah That's not it but I don't

856
01:14:02,590 --> 01:14:07,050
Yeah, I feel like that's enough for you to start out with.

857
01:14:07,310 --> 01:14:08,450
Yeah, that was like four moves.

858
01:14:08,770 --> 01:14:09,650
That's that.

859
01:14:10,170 --> 01:14:10,970
Yeah, yeah.

860
01:14:11,470 --> 01:14:11,990
That's it.

861
01:14:11,990 --> 01:14:12,690
I got this.

862
01:14:12,770 --> 01:14:13,550
It's four moves.

863
01:14:15,610 --> 01:14:18,210
You want to try some rank matches and we can see?

864
01:14:18,730 --> 01:14:22,210
Oh, we get annihilated by the bots.

865
01:14:22,430 --> 01:14:27,790
Let's get, uh, uh, it's gonna be harder because you're gonna fight back.

866
01:14:28,930 --> 01:14:30,010
Yeah, they will fight back.

867
01:14:30,090 --> 01:14:31,190
It's crazy.

868
01:14:32,590 --> 01:15:03,250
all right let me get it in yeah also let me check your settings um or yeah google go out of that and then go in options i think press like start yeah options on the bottom right yeah and then go to graphics oh yeah no it's all the way up it's it's it might be like in the highest graphics possible yeah do put input delay reduction on okay um Where's that?

869
01:15:03,270 --> 01:15:03,970
It's the bottom one.

870
01:15:04,110 --> 01:15:04,710
It's the bottom one.

871
01:15:04,890 --> 01:15:05,150
Oh, here.

872
01:15:05,790 --> 01:15:06,150
Yeah.

873
01:15:08,050 --> 01:15:08,490
Yeah.

874
01:15:08,950 --> 01:15:11,910
That'll just make it a bit easier for you to react to stuff.

875
01:15:12,010 --> 01:15:12,390
Oh, yeah.

876
01:15:13,590 --> 01:15:14,030
Okay.

877
01:15:14,310 --> 01:15:15,370
Yeah, that should be good.

878
01:15:16,330 --> 01:15:17,210
Go online.

879
01:15:24,670 --> 01:15:25,430
Not searching.

880
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:37,380
Where is it?

881
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:37,740
Why is it paused?

882
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:39,880
Oh, there it is.

883
01:15:44,970 --> 01:15:45,630
Oh, there it is.

884
01:15:46,510 --> 01:15:49,650
That's how you can go into training while you're Yeah, you can.

885
01:15:50,110 --> 01:15:50,910
There's a faster way.

886
01:15:51,150 --> 01:15:57,830
If you go back, go out, go out again, and then press square in this menu.

887
01:15:58,910 --> 01:15:59,350
Oh!

888
01:16:01,510 --> 01:16:03,830
Yeah, it's a it's a secret they added.

889
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:05,830
Oh my god, it's like a little easter egg.

890
01:16:06,910 --> 01:16:10,570
Yeah, and then open matchmaking telling you and you should be able to do it.

891
01:16:12,950 --> 01:16:15,990
Come on guys, like a little bonus guys chat.

892
01:16:16,170 --> 01:16:17,090
Look, did you guys know that chat?

893
01:16:24,430 --> 01:16:25,470
It again.

894
01:16:32,370 --> 01:16:34,030
Where are my bots?

895
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:36,230
How is it searching opponents like that?

896
01:16:36,950 --> 01:16:38,030
Just give me a bot.

897
01:16:39,130 --> 01:16:40,230
You want a bot?

898
01:16:40,750 --> 01:16:47,390
I thought like when you first start the matches, doing ranks, they'd give you bots at first, don't they?

899
01:16:47,510 --> 01:16:50,090
It says you've played seven matches with Honda.

900
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:51,210
When the fuck?

901
01:16:51,310 --> 01:16:52,070
What the fuck?

902
01:16:52,310 --> 01:16:52,930
Oh yeah!

903
01:16:53,170 --> 01:16:55,010
Yeah, no, I remember now.

904
01:16:55,490 --> 01:16:57,030
I got absolutely destroyed.

905
01:16:57,590 --> 01:16:58,910
And then we swapped the game.

906
01:16:59,230 --> 01:16:59,790
I remember.

907
01:17:02,270 --> 01:17:04,450
But maybe, maybe now you'll...

908
01:17:04,450 --> 01:17:05,190
Yeah, maybe now.

909
01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:09,890
Now that I'm not button mashing on Honda, it should get easier.

910
01:17:15,770 --> 01:17:16,630
Oh shit.

911
01:17:17,330 --> 01:17:17,910
Confirm.

912
01:17:20,330 --> 01:17:22,650
Here comes a new challenger!

913
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:30,120
Oh my god, he's ironed.

914
01:17:30,140 --> 01:17:31,540
He's so good.

915
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:34,200
He's not iron yourself around you.

916
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:36,320
He's so good.

917
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:37,240
Oh my god.

918
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:38,100
Hello.

919
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:39,200
Hello, ma'am.

920
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:42,400
I just just hold back and like, yeah, keep keeping your eyes out.

921
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:44,140
Oh shit.

922
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:45,580
She fights back.

923
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:46,780
Don't worry about that.

924
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:49,680
Hello.

925
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:54,240
That's not cool.

926
01:17:57,420 --> 01:17:57,480
What?

927
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:58,940
Wait, how the fuck?

928
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:01,020
Oh my god.

929
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:02,320
Huh?

930
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:05,540
Get off of me.

931
01:18:08,820 --> 01:18:08,980
Oh.

932
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:11,640
Get off of me.

933
01:18:14,020 --> 01:18:14,700
What the fuck?

934
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:15,780
She's like adapting.

935
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:21,240
Yeah, it's when you're knocked out and you hold forward in DI.

936
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:22,420
Oh, hold forward.

937
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:22,940
Yeah, okay.

938
01:18:23,660 --> 01:18:24,460
Forward DI.

939
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:26,240
That's crazy.

940
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:29,580
Get off of me!

941
01:18:31,260 --> 01:18:32,100
Get off!

942
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:32,760
Get off!

943
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:35,820
Oh shit, okay.

944
01:18:40,770 --> 01:18:41,770
That's fucking red.

945
01:18:42,530 --> 01:18:43,170
Get off!

946
01:18:45,810 --> 01:18:47,450
Get off of me!

947
01:18:49,030 --> 01:18:49,630
Nice.

948
01:18:51,190 --> 01:18:52,770
Yeah, you just said I've been late there.

949
01:18:52,910 --> 01:18:54,190
That's why you're super didn't come out.

950
01:18:54,490 --> 01:18:55,290
That's why, okay.

951
01:18:58,970 --> 01:18:59,830
Oh shit, dang!

952
01:19:02,390 --> 01:19:02,990
Yay!

953
01:19:05,230 --> 01:19:07,210
Yeah, I think we're looking good.

954
01:19:12,530 --> 01:19:14,550
Leave me alone!

955
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:21,250
Oh, she can't touch me.

956
01:19:25,730 --> 01:19:26,030
Yay!

957
01:19:32,590 --> 01:19:34,130
Guys, the ground pound is too...

958
01:19:34,130 --> 01:19:37,330
That's like level three for me, as I'm not there yet.

959
01:19:38,670 --> 01:19:39,990
I'm not level three.

960
01:19:42,830 --> 01:19:43,710
Get out!

961
01:19:45,550 --> 01:19:45,990
Yay!

962
01:19:50,610 --> 01:19:52,390
Oh my god, my record!

963
01:19:52,830 --> 01:19:54,210
I don't even- I did that!

964
01:19:55,270 --> 01:19:56,730
No, we can get a 505 though.

965
01:19:56,910 --> 01:19:57,970
He's got to win the next two.

966
01:19:58,630 --> 01:19:59,050
All right.

967
01:20:00,090 --> 01:20:01,370
Oh my god, I forgot to win and done her.

968
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:02,630
It's been so long.

969
01:20:03,250 --> 01:20:04,490
Why would you win and done her?

970
01:20:06,170 --> 01:20:07,850
Because I know she wants a rematch.

971
01:20:11,030 --> 01:20:14,350
It makes her the most mad.

972
01:20:14,650 --> 01:20:14,950
Uh-huh.

973
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:21,100
Get away from...

974
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:22,960
Get away from...

975
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:22,960
Get

976
01:20:27,210 --> 01:20:30,130
out of here.

977
01:20:31,090 --> 01:20:31,770
Yay!

978
01:20:33,190 --> 01:20:33,950
Oh, nice!

979
01:20:34,550 --> 01:20:36,170
Just stopped at the right time.

980
01:20:39,450 --> 01:20:40,610
Round two.

981
01:20:52,310 --> 01:20:54,530
Oh no, oh no, don't touch me please.

982
01:20:55,130 --> 01:20:55,970
I'm sorry ma'am.

983
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:05,170
Oh no, he's fighting back.

984
01:21:06,490 --> 01:21:09,310
Yeah, when you're burned out, you can also, you still have access to your supers.

985
01:21:09,850 --> 01:21:10,030
Okay.

986
01:21:10,550 --> 01:21:11,610
Either L3 or R3.

987
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:12,730
I forget which one.

988
01:21:12,770 --> 01:21:13,550
One of them is clunk.

989
01:21:14,170 --> 01:21:15,050
Yeah, that one, that one.

990
01:21:15,190 --> 01:21:15,810
Get off!

991
01:21:16,770 --> 01:21:18,050
Get off ma'am!

992
01:21:19,010 --> 01:21:21,370
What the fu- That's okay.

993
01:21:23,990 --> 01:21:25,030
Get off!

994
01:21:26,310 --> 01:21:26,490
Okay.

995
01:21:28,470 --> 01:21:32,290
How do you tell what they like block my grab?

996
01:21:32,610 --> 01:21:33,470
I'm worried.

997
01:21:35,110 --> 01:21:36,690
There's nothing to be worried about.

998
01:21:37,210 --> 01:21:39,450
I think their game plan is good right now.

999
01:21:39,890 --> 01:21:40,590
Okay, nice.

1000
01:21:41,130 --> 01:21:41,850
That's good.

1001
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:43,710
They can't adapt to me on the tournament day.

1002
01:21:44,190 --> 01:21:45,250
Not like last time.

1003
01:21:46,410 --> 01:21:47,890
Yeah, that is true.

1004
01:21:48,130 --> 01:21:49,470
They can't adapt to me.

1005
01:21:51,490 --> 01:21:54,770
And even if they could, the strategy is honestly really hard to deal with.

1006
01:21:55,150 --> 01:21:56,010
Okay, that's good.

1007
01:21:59,710 --> 01:22:01,750
Especially if you can start doing the bus slams.

1008
01:22:02,390 --> 01:22:03,010
Okay, yeah, yeah.

1009
01:22:03,310 --> 01:22:05,450
That's for day two Doki.

1010
01:22:06,710 --> 01:22:09,250
Day two Doki will pick that up.

1011
01:22:10,890 --> 01:22:14,210
If I learn a fifth move, I think my CPU would crash.

1012
01:22:15,250 --> 01:22:15,490
Yeah.

1013
01:22:15,970 --> 01:22:16,450
There you go.

1014
01:22:17,050 --> 01:22:17,910
What were you about to say?

1015
01:22:19,050 --> 01:22:20,450
I don't remember it.

1016
01:22:22,690 --> 01:22:24,990
This is why I can't learn a fifth move.

1017
01:22:27,190 --> 01:22:28,690
Are you like a Pokemon?

1018
01:22:29,430 --> 01:22:30,430
Yeah, you learn five.

1019
01:22:30,450 --> 01:22:32,810
If I have to learn a fifth move, we gotta delete a fourth move.

1020
01:22:33,450 --> 01:22:33,630
Oops.

1021
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:36,530
We had to delete something.

1022
01:22:37,310 --> 01:22:38,190
Hello there, sir.

1023
01:22:38,830 --> 01:22:39,310
Oh, my God.

1024
01:22:39,450 --> 01:22:39,830
Silver.

1025
01:22:40,730 --> 01:22:41,770
You're so high rank.

1026
01:22:42,490 --> 01:22:44,750
That was my rank from last Sage Jamstab.

1027
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:49,350
Oh, shit.

1028
01:22:50,130 --> 01:22:50,830
Oh, my God.

1029
01:22:51,370 --> 01:22:55,610
oh my god oh no they figured my strat

1030
01:22:59,590 --> 01:23:29,450
it's not cool bro oh no he goes square balls you just gotta jump over them to get close first he knows oh no stupid fireball if i was saying beef i would grab that yeah you can also try di if you're a bit closer but you have to get close first because otherwise you can't really head but oh

1031
01:23:32,740 --> 01:23:35,120
no okay let's try and wait a little bit

1032
01:23:45,700 --> 01:24:04,930
oh oh no my grab what the fuck what is he doing what is he doing to me okay so Yay, Sylvia!

1033
01:24:06,450 --> 01:24:07,450
I leave.

1034
01:24:09,550 --> 01:24:11,290
I don't like...

1035
01:24:11,290 --> 01:24:12,310
I don't like him.

1036
01:24:13,290 --> 01:24:14,190
That's fair.

1037
01:24:16,990 --> 01:24:18,830
I don't like you fought back.

1038
01:24:19,730 --> 01:24:22,730
Yeah, the fireballs, I think, kind of counter what you've learned so far.

1039
01:24:22,990 --> 01:24:23,270
Yeah.

1040
01:24:23,450 --> 01:24:27,970
You have to start jumping and you can try and just jump and do your heavy auto combo.

1041
01:24:28,490 --> 01:24:29,790
Okay, so just jump.

1042
01:24:30,210 --> 01:24:31,330
Is there like...

1043
01:24:31,330 --> 01:24:33,710
Is there a grapple for your Honda when they jump?

1044
01:24:33,730 --> 01:25:04,010
or no um not not like eaves no uh i wanted to grab him so bad yeah you just have to press a button so you press like your heavy button in there oh just like slap him yeah just slap him down you want to try and time it if they're on the ground still so that it's them oh i see oh my god i play silver that was the the rank i ended on gif it's already going up guys we're already getting Yeah.

1045
01:25:05,230 --> 01:25:10,530
Yeah, your GIFO is like silver four though I think I saw so we gotta win a few more.

1046
01:25:10,790 --> 01:25:12,010
I'll win a few more.

1047
01:25:15,410 --> 01:25:18,670
I can't, I know right, why can't every character have a GIF grapple?

1048
01:25:21,050 --> 01:25:22,670
Should be like a GIFO.

1049
01:25:25,470 --> 01:25:27,490
I don't think that would be good for the game.

1050
01:25:29,030 --> 01:25:33,110
If every character had a GIF grapple, it's balanced.

1051
01:25:34,410 --> 01:26:33,260
well yeah everyone will have anti-air yeah I keep forgetting I could mix it up with this yeah but you don't have to if the other one is working okay my other silver players dragons queue up not that I'm playing your silver but like I need more players to play against please I need my practice guys also yeah said but some of it has armor like it can also go through fireballs so if you're just charging wait not that it's the yeah the yeah that one so if you're just holding charge and you can try and go through a fireball like that oh i see okay where

1052
01:26:36,740 --> 01:26:56,120
are my rinkers come on three fighter six is alive you can try turning it to three to five for the network settings oh nice here comes a new challenger big

1053
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:12,260
schlop oh my god oh my god he jumped It's like he's played against Honda before.

1054
01:27:15,930 --> 01:27:16,450
What?

1055
01:27:18,210 --> 01:27:19,310
Oh my god!

1056
01:27:20,190 --> 01:27:23,290
It's like he's a...

1057
01:27:23,290 --> 01:27:24,390
That's okay, don't worry.

1058
01:27:25,290 --> 01:27:25,990
I'm worrying.

1059
01:27:26,270 --> 01:27:29,670
He's jumping, he's like, fucking where is he going?

1060
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:40,060
Oh my god, it's because he does Hadookin!

1061
01:27:41,780 --> 01:27:43,540
Yeah, he has one of those two.

1062
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:50,340
I think for your your head buts you just have to wait a bit in between them so like you can get your hand players.

1063
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:50,760
Okay.

1064
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:55,780
Oh no, oh no.

1065
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:58,320
The problem with that is you use all your cage.

1066
01:28:03,940 --> 01:28:05,860
I might have messed up there.

1067
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:08,120
I got a little too excited.

1068
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:09,780
You still have your supers.

1069
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:12,640
So if he gets on you again, you can try and do a super.

1070
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:16,660
Oh my god, he's not letting me do anything.

1071
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:19,700
Guys, I want to go back to iron.

1072
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:24,300
Oh, you want to rem...

1073
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:26,640
Okay.

1074
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:29,620
You can farm me.

1075
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:33,540
You can farm me, I guess.

1076
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:37,640
I didn't grab him.

1077
01:28:39,340 --> 01:28:40,540
But he grabs me?

1078
01:28:41,380 --> 01:28:41,760
Wait!

1079
01:28:43,580 --> 01:28:44,500
Wait, I don't have...

1080
01:28:44,520 --> 01:29:20,970
for for his grab you have to do like the regular grab oh the regular where you're great what is the regular grab guys it's L2 it's L2 he does he's giving me the throw loot okay but what if I throw you back oh he won't let me throw him back that's fine nice that's it that's it I have a Oh no,

1081
01:29:21,090 --> 01:29:22,370
he doesn't need a coach.

1082
01:29:27,340 --> 01:29:29,540
Oh no, that was a little.

1083
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:35,460
I was trying to myself too.

1084
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:41,940
Now I know why I turned it off.

1085
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:45,100
Now I know why I turned off the controls.

1086
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:47,960
I don't know.

1087
01:29:47,960 --> 01:30:30,840
i thought i thought you would stop fighting me it's okay as long as as the other new players don't learn ryu and the other guy can i know there's an aki and a jury wait do they counter me aki has a fireball but the thing is if you learn butt slam you can also get over the fireball with butt slam so you could try doing that like because you just need one of them to go over right okay we got this we start off with the butt slab they won't know oh he left he did not want to fight me

1088
01:30:35,280 --> 01:31:10,880
also you can steer the butt slam to go like left and right how do you see oh do you like these hold left or right to make it go closer or farther what like you do the input for it yeah it's kind of confusing like right after you do the input you hold left or right oh it was with the with the jump no like so like you do like you do the bus time normally and then right when you're going up in the air you hold the direction what what

1089
01:31:14,380 --> 01:31:35,000
all right that's that's for day two maybe that's a bit too hard yeah just try and get the bus out first oh my gosh i peaked in my first game i don't think i can hit that that doha and it again well get that marissa back

1090
01:31:41,490 --> 01:31:44,550
i get it spamming

1091
01:31:54,110 --> 01:32:20,710
please honda work with me honda please sometimes you're pressing the punch too early now you just gotta make sure you're pressing it like pretty much at the same time can i have a charge when i'm in the mid-air like does that where does it have to be like when i land it no you can charge in mid-air so like right after you start charging yeah wait that Oh,

1092
01:32:20,930 --> 01:32:20,950
okay.

1093
01:32:21,190 --> 01:32:21,410
Never mind.

1094
01:32:21,610 --> 01:32:22,950
That doesn't change anything.

1095
01:32:24,270 --> 01:32:24,370
What?

1096
01:32:25,810 --> 01:32:26,410
It's close though.

1097
01:32:26,850 --> 01:32:27,950
You're definitely getting the charge.

1098
01:32:28,150 --> 01:32:31,870
I mean, I think it's just an input after you're missing.

1099
01:32:33,830 --> 01:32:34,530
Oh my god, please.

1100
01:32:38,410 --> 01:32:40,110
Please, Aunda, work with me.

1101
01:32:40,150 --> 01:32:41,150
We gotta work together.

1102
01:32:44,670 --> 01:32:46,870
I think you have to wait like a little longer than you are.

1103
01:32:47,810 --> 01:32:48,590
Aunda, please.

1104
01:32:48,670 --> 01:32:49,930
And then that one you're pressing the punch.

1105
01:32:49,950 --> 01:32:50,950
I'll be early.

1106
01:32:50,990 --> 01:32:51,210
Okay.

1107
01:32:54,130 --> 01:32:54,650
Okay.

1108
01:32:55,970 --> 01:32:57,010
Oh, Honda, please!

1109
01:32:57,510 --> 01:32:58,510
We have three days!

1110
01:33:06,210 --> 01:33:07,010
Oh my god.

1111
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:15,660
One is enough, I guess.

1112
01:33:17,020 --> 01:33:18,780
Yeah, you can get one, that's...

1113
01:33:18,780 --> 01:33:20,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll do that.

1114
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:22,460
One is enough.

1115
01:33:23,100 --> 01:33:24,960
One is enough for day one.

1116
01:33:30,070 --> 01:33:30,590
Okay.

1117
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:35,620
Why does no one want to fight me?

1118
01:33:36,020 --> 01:33:38,060
I got rejected five times.

1119
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:45,320
Yeah, try and put it on three to five when it lets you pull up the menu again.

1120
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:47,180
Let's see.

1121
01:33:52,770 --> 01:33:55,090
Oh, three to five.

1122
01:34:03,170 --> 01:34:06,530
Wait, so who are the other characters that I'm playing against?

1123
01:34:07,250 --> 01:34:07,770
Oh, this guy.

1124
01:34:08,170 --> 01:34:10,150
Yeah, this character and Aria.

1125
01:34:10,170 --> 01:34:38,270
at least okay hello kevin oh my god i got a social security number it might as well all right watch this oh um almost almost it almost worked what she blocks that okay i gotta make sure i don't i don't accidentally

1126
01:34:41,590 --> 01:34:42,230
Hello.

1127
01:34:44,410 --> 01:34:45,570
Oh god, she knows.

1128
01:34:48,150 --> 01:34:49,370
She knows that.

1129
01:34:50,170 --> 01:34:51,150
I'm not a natural.

1130
01:34:59,260 --> 01:35:00,140
That's right.

1131
01:35:00,540 --> 01:35:02,360
I didn't mean to do that, but that's right.

1132
01:35:04,740 --> 01:35:05,920
That's looking right.

1133
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:07,820
Oh no.

1134
01:35:10,420 --> 01:35:11,060
What?

1135
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:11,920
Yay!

1136
01:35:12,740 --> 01:35:14,500
Because I killed her.

1137
01:35:16,740 --> 01:35:18,480
If they're really low on life, you can just do it.

1138
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:20,340
Because they can't do it back.

1139
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:23,180
That's fine.

1140
01:35:26,830 --> 01:35:27,190
Hello.

1141
01:35:28,770 --> 01:35:29,090
Hello.

1142
01:35:29,790 --> 01:35:30,750
Oh shit, not hello.

1143
01:35:32,270 --> 01:35:32,870
Oh no.

1144
01:35:34,270 --> 01:35:35,910
Yeah, I grabbed you back, girl.

1145
01:35:40,250 --> 01:35:41,010
That's right.

1146
01:35:41,970 --> 01:35:43,210
My loyal fans.

1147
01:35:44,450 --> 01:35:46,390
I hope they found this.

1148
01:35:47,710 --> 01:35:50,030
That's what he means in the inside.

1149
01:35:51,010 --> 01:35:51,970
Uh-huh.

1150
01:35:53,370 --> 01:35:53,530
Oh.

1151
01:35:54,190 --> 01:35:54,930
Goodbye.

1152
01:35:55,450 --> 01:35:56,930
Oh, hello?

1153
01:35:57,910 --> 01:35:58,190
Hello?

1154
01:35:59,770 --> 01:35:59,990
Oh!

1155
01:36:00,390 --> 01:36:00,390
Yo,

1156
01:36:05,110 --> 01:36:07,190
please, leave me alone.

1157
01:36:08,610 --> 01:36:09,490
Haha!

1158
01:36:10,210 --> 01:36:10,910
Oh, shit.

1159
01:36:12,270 --> 01:36:13,510
That's right.

1160
01:36:16,210 --> 01:36:16,850
Goodbye.

1161
01:36:17,450 --> 01:36:19,710
Oh wait, I should practice the OOPs.

1162
01:36:20,310 --> 01:36:21,930
Sorry, I was just messing with him.

1163
01:36:22,310 --> 01:36:22,630
That's okay.

1164
01:36:23,050 --> 01:36:23,810
I forgot.

1165
01:36:24,210 --> 01:36:25,210
I have to practice again.

1166
01:36:25,210 --> 01:36:26,410
I think you know the matchup.

1167
01:36:26,570 --> 01:36:28,410
You just gotta learn the other two, bro.

1168
01:36:30,990 --> 01:36:31,430
Okay.

1169
01:36:32,110 --> 01:36:34,310
I will get this to work in game.

1170
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:38,820
Oh, wait!

1171
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:41,900
Wait, that's three!

1172
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:44,340
And stop getting it!

1173
01:36:46,780 --> 01:36:48,280
Okay, five is the limit.

1174
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:51,580
That was good though.

1175
01:36:51,860 --> 01:36:52,660
I did it.

1176
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:54,540
That's more than one.

1177
01:36:55,680 --> 01:36:56,260
Look at that.

1178
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:07,840
Three?

1179
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:09,040
Three.

1180
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:09,520
All right.

1181
01:37:10,760 --> 01:37:11,320
Okay.

1182
01:37:11,820 --> 01:37:12,040
Three.

1183
01:37:15,460 --> 01:37:16,460
Oh my god, please.

1184
01:37:17,020 --> 01:37:17,920
Please, Honda.

1185
01:37:18,620 --> 01:37:19,900
We were doing working so well.

1186
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:21,080
We're in sync.

1187
01:37:29,970 --> 01:37:30,530
Please.

1188
01:37:31,150 --> 01:37:31,710
No.

1189
01:37:33,350 --> 01:37:33,550
No.

1190
01:37:34,490 --> 01:37:34,630
No.

1191
01:37:34,630 --> 01:37:34,850
No.

1192
01:37:35,130 --> 01:37:35,190
No.

1193
01:37:35,210 --> 01:37:35,770
You know what?

1194
01:37:36,770 --> 01:37:40,210
I'm going to raise, I'm going to lower the bar even more.

1195
01:37:41,610 --> 01:37:42,350
That'll be fine, right?

1196
01:37:42,970 --> 01:37:45,070
Two is a bit scary, but you could try it.

1197
01:37:45,190 --> 01:37:47,390
Yeah, yeah, like it'll be scary for them too.

1198
01:37:48,250 --> 01:37:48,530
You know?

1199
01:37:49,190 --> 01:37:50,030
That is true.

1200
01:37:50,450 --> 01:37:52,890
Like, it'll be scary for them.

1201
01:37:53,090 --> 01:37:57,370
If I, if they have bad, I have fiber, so it'd be less scary.

1202
01:37:58,250 --> 01:38:00,390
There's no way the other team has fiber.

1203
01:38:02,050 --> 01:38:03,250
Yeah, probably not.

1204
01:38:03,370 --> 01:38:03,890
Yeah, yeah.

1205
01:38:05,270 --> 01:38:07,330
So my input should go first.

1206
01:38:10,230 --> 01:38:11,130
That's how it works, right?

1207
01:38:12,210 --> 01:38:16,850
Not really, but if you think it does, then maybe...

1208
01:38:16,850 --> 01:38:18,270
Oh, yeah, because it's...

1209
01:38:18,270 --> 01:38:21,450
In fighting games, it's like the shittier internet wins, right?

1210
01:38:22,510 --> 01:38:24,630
Yeah, or at least it's like balanced.

1211
01:38:24,770 --> 01:38:25,590
Like they kind of...

1212
01:38:25,590 --> 01:38:30,010
It's just the total connection, basically, because you're connecting to each other, not a server.

1213
01:38:32,010 --> 01:38:33,810
Wait, then how does lag switching work?

1214
01:38:35,210 --> 01:38:38,050
Um, like it makes it laggy for both sides, basically.

1215
01:38:38,690 --> 01:38:40,910
Yeah, but how come the person who lag switches wins?

1216
01:38:42,330 --> 01:38:47,130
It's because, like, if you actually have a lag switch, you do it, like, during another person's combo.

1217
01:38:47,910 --> 01:38:49,090
Oh, that's so smart.

1218
01:38:49,310 --> 01:38:51,810
And how does, like, theoretically, someone get a lag switch?

1219
01:38:56,010 --> 01:38:57,750
Yeah, I don't know about that.

1220
01:38:57,910 --> 01:38:58,250
Really great.

1221
01:38:58,290 --> 01:38:59,290
That's a joke, Capcom.

1222
01:38:59,810 --> 01:39:00,970
Capcom, that's a joke.

1223
01:39:01,390 --> 01:39:02,190
That's a joke.

1224
01:39:02,390 --> 01:39:03,870
I would never.

1225
01:39:06,370 --> 01:39:07,710
That's a good question, Lil.

1226
01:39:07,990 --> 01:39:09,050
Yeah, this is a good question.

1227
01:39:09,310 --> 01:39:11,070
Like, I was one...

1228
01:39:11,770 --> 01:39:12,650
It's a joke.

1229
01:39:12,870 --> 01:39:13,470
It's a joke.

1230
01:39:14,450 --> 01:39:15,070
Oh, my God.

1231
01:39:15,230 --> 01:39:15,670
It's him.

1232
01:39:16,310 --> 01:39:17,270
It's Big Slop.

1233
01:39:18,250 --> 01:39:19,430
That's fucking right.

1234
01:39:19,870 --> 01:39:20,790
Get out of here.

1235
01:39:20,870 --> 01:39:22,210
I learned another move.

1236
01:39:24,430 --> 01:39:26,070
Okay, but that's it.

1237
01:39:28,010 --> 01:39:28,610
That's it.

1238
01:39:28,650 --> 01:39:30,750
Oh, he's trying to throw me again.

1239
01:39:31,450 --> 01:39:31,950
Nice.

1240
01:39:35,890 --> 01:39:40,350
bro get out of here go just wake up

1241
01:39:44,090 --> 01:40:03,550
oh my god yeah i think if you have your like just keep your charge and try and head but when he jumps he's trying to time it i'm fighting back bro guys i'm trying i swear to god i'm trying to fight back

1242
01:40:12,790 --> 01:40:59,050
that's right it's mine oh my god he's too far what what did he do to me what did he do to me oh i'm not letting you farm me you're farming me enough can sometimes do like the not easy headbutt version because that one i think doesn't go as far as the other one wait not easy headbutt like the the one where you like press forward in the button instead of like the special one oh i swear to god oh no it's the hog okay he's someone else okay it doesn't give you the same person twice in a row

1243
01:41:03,790 --> 01:41:06,290
Oh my god, he's just like me.

1244
01:41:06,770 --> 01:41:08,290
Do I get my first cast?

1245
01:41:08,670 --> 01:41:09,050
That's fucking right.

1246
01:41:09,690 --> 01:41:13,330
Oh no.

1247
01:41:14,370 --> 01:41:14,770
Oh no.

1248
01:41:18,790 --> 01:41:20,430
Oh my god, what the fuck?

1249
01:41:25,430 --> 01:41:26,250
That's fucking right.

1250
01:41:27,390 --> 01:41:29,730
Oh my god, we both fucked up.

1251
01:41:31,310 --> 01:41:32,670
But he has better anti-air.

1252
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:38,840
Oh no.

1253
01:41:40,680 --> 01:41:42,620
like he knows combos or something.

1254
01:41:43,820 --> 01:41:46,680
Yeah, I mean, he's on modern too, so he's just doing the auto combos.

1255
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:50,080
What the?

1256
01:41:51,740 --> 01:41:52,340
Oh, what?

1257
01:41:53,220 --> 01:41:54,920
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1258
01:41:56,520 --> 01:41:57,720
Get out of here!

1259
01:42:00,340 --> 01:42:00,920
My turn!

1260
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:02,380
Oh my god, never mind, it's not my turn.

1261
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:07,860
Oh, I timed it right.

1262
01:42:14,490 --> 01:42:15,690
What the fuck?

1263
01:42:15,910 --> 01:42:16,970
I can't please.

1264
01:42:18,150 --> 01:42:19,930
Oh my god, please.

1265
01:42:21,790 --> 01:42:24,470
His antires are pretty good because he's on Modern 2.

1266
01:42:25,390 --> 01:42:25,850
That's okay.

1267
01:42:25,950 --> 01:42:27,310
You're not firing me out of there.

1268
01:42:29,670 --> 01:42:30,310
It's okay.

1269
01:42:30,370 --> 01:42:31,870
None of them are learning Ken, right?

1270
01:42:32,510 --> 01:42:33,690
As long as they don't know.

1271
01:42:34,050 --> 01:42:35,670
They don't know I can't deal with Ken.

1272
01:42:36,350 --> 01:42:39,910
There's one other player, but I don't know who he's playing it.

1273
01:42:40,290 --> 01:42:41,550
Alright, that's fine.

1274
01:42:41,770 --> 01:42:44,650
As long as he's not playing Ken, we're okay.

1275
01:42:45,910 --> 01:42:50,550
i'm worried okay it's okay guys i can learn against all my other matchups

1276
01:42:54,270 --> 01:43:19,850
wait so what do i do against ken if they find out i can't deal with ken um you can try so try doing like your jump but like try hitting your button um like in the air yeah and try to try to make it hit them okay the the heavy it's the circle circle oh so So you wanted to hit them and then you do your auto heavy.

1277
01:43:20,290 --> 01:43:22,810
Ah, oh, auto heavy.

1278
01:43:23,590 --> 01:43:28,090
That or like you go into the combo after either one works.

1279
01:43:28,870 --> 01:43:29,790
Oh, like that.

1280
01:43:30,330 --> 01:43:31,310
Oh, I see.

1281
01:43:31,750 --> 01:43:36,750
So that way, if you jump over a fireball, you get like a big, oopsie big combo.

1282
01:43:42,890 --> 01:43:44,250
Two, we're both here.

1283
01:43:44,470 --> 01:43:45,870
Oh my God, we're both here to suffer.

1284
01:43:49,710 --> 01:44:20,570
yeah oh she's bronze yeah this should be free then unless unless he's smurfing oh wait she blocked i think she's you're not new yeah oh yeah i can't believe it there's no way there's no way she's fucking with me she's actually with me there's no way There's no way!

1285
01:44:20,850 --> 01:44:23,430
There's no way she's frowned!

1286
01:44:25,490 --> 01:44:27,850
I refuse to believe this.

1287
01:44:29,050 --> 01:44:31,970
She's playing the slowest fucking Kami game of my life.

1288
01:44:32,530 --> 01:44:33,230
That's it!

1289
01:44:33,990 --> 01:44:35,070
That's right!

1290
01:44:36,510 --> 01:44:38,770
Oh, I didn't know that toy at all.

1291
01:44:39,510 --> 01:44:40,910
What did I do?

1292
01:44:42,130 --> 01:44:43,630
I mean, it doesn't do anything bad.

1293
01:44:43,890 --> 01:44:45,150
It didn't hit you for a while.

1294
01:44:49,950 --> 01:44:51,090
Why am I?

1295
01:44:52,410 --> 01:44:53,450
I hate you.

1296
01:44:54,170 --> 01:44:55,630
I hate you, Kami.

1297
01:44:56,950 --> 01:44:57,850
That's a key.

1298
01:44:58,050 --> 01:44:58,390
Right!

1299
01:44:59,950 --> 01:45:01,650
That's fucking right!

1300
01:45:02,430 --> 01:45:03,290
Oh my god, she counters.

1301
01:45:03,510 --> 01:45:03,690
What?

1302
01:45:04,030 --> 01:45:05,750
Oh my god, she's lag switching.

1303
01:45:09,330 --> 01:45:11,370
Chose the wrong person to lag switch.

1304
01:45:11,530 --> 01:45:13,710
I don't know how to...

1305
01:45:16,330 --> 01:45:17,210
I hate her.

1306
01:45:17,250 --> 01:45:18,310
She's making me block.

1307
01:45:19,350 --> 01:45:19,730
Hmm.

1308
01:45:21,270 --> 01:45:38,590
oh i'm on the right side whoops yeah you thought you were the one with all the life i was looking at my green meter and i was like how did i lose my green meter she blocks too much about i'll do one more

1309
01:45:41,710 --> 01:45:47,430
yeah i think if you would just wait a bit more then you'll you'll do a lot better oh thank god she left

1310
01:45:50,710 --> 01:45:58,070
Yeah, because a lot of people are jumping, so if you just wait and then you have your charge to anti-hear them.

1311
01:45:58,350 --> 01:45:58,670
Okay.

1312
01:45:59,090 --> 01:45:59,910
Um, yeah.

1313
01:46:01,450 --> 01:46:03,670
Oh, Jerry, that's my matchup.

1314
01:46:03,990 --> 01:46:04,270
Yeah.

1315
01:46:07,890 --> 01:46:09,430
He's a dealer hot.

1316
01:46:10,010 --> 01:46:10,630
Good name.

1317
01:46:19,810 --> 01:46:21,230
Oh, freaking freak.

1318
01:46:21,610 --> 01:46:22,410
Get out of here.

1319
01:46:26,110 --> 01:46:26,670
Freak!

1320
01:46:29,190 --> 01:46:31,210
There is no way.

1321
01:46:32,610 --> 01:46:35,970
I'm putting you some fucking prodigies right now.

1322
01:46:42,430 --> 01:46:44,430
Wait, what the fuck?

1323
01:46:45,510 --> 01:46:48,750
Oh my god, and you jump over that?

1324
01:46:49,210 --> 01:46:50,490
There is no way.

1325
01:46:52,210 --> 01:46:54,570
Get out of my lobby.

1326
01:47:05,890 --> 01:47:06,370
Okay.

1327
01:47:07,270 --> 01:47:10,110
I like that.

1328
01:47:10,910 --> 01:47:11,010
Oh.

1329
01:47:14,760 --> 01:47:15,840
Oh my god.

1330
01:47:16,180 --> 01:47:16,240
Oh.

1331
01:47:16,640 --> 01:47:18,240
Yeah, you could have died back on that one.

1332
01:47:19,140 --> 01:47:19,880
That took you right.

1333
01:47:20,020 --> 01:47:21,140
Get out of here!

1334
01:47:23,440 --> 01:47:24,320
Oh, never mind.

1335
01:47:24,640 --> 01:47:25,700
I guess I'll get out of here.

1336
01:47:28,060 --> 01:47:28,540
Oh.

1337
01:47:29,100 --> 01:47:29,360
Oh.

1338
01:47:32,370 --> 01:47:33,990
Oh my god, she's making me laugh.

1339
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:38,540
What is wrong with you?

1340
01:47:41,590 --> 01:47:42,890
Get out!

1341
01:47:45,310 --> 01:47:45,710
Okay.

1342
01:47:48,060 --> 01:47:48,770
There we go.

1343
01:47:50,270 --> 01:47:53,070
I don't like it.

1344
01:47:54,350 --> 01:47:55,490
I can play so slow.

1345
01:48:04,470 --> 01:48:07,610
Why am I...

1346
01:48:09,210 --> 01:48:10,130
She's just getting lucky.

1347
01:48:15,010 --> 01:48:16,450
Where the fuck am I?

1348
01:48:21,700 --> 01:48:22,220
Okay.

1349
01:48:22,760 --> 01:48:23,820
Oh, never mind.

1350
01:48:24,240 --> 01:48:24,700
Okay.

1351
01:48:25,580 --> 01:48:26,660
Oh, it's over.

1352
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:30,260
It was a good try.

1353
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:31,620
It was a good try.

1354
01:48:32,580 --> 01:48:33,720
Yeah, it was definitely a good try.

1355
01:48:34,740 --> 01:48:35,820
You almost came back.

1356
01:48:37,180 --> 01:48:37,500
Alright.

1357
01:48:39,080 --> 01:48:42,020
Oh, I wanted to do my butt slam, but she was first.

1358
01:48:44,600 --> 01:48:45,120
Oh.

1359
01:48:52,470 --> 01:49:01,670

1360
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:15,800
oh unlucky come on oh shit how did she know I wanted to spam it

1361
01:49:19,890 --> 01:49:38,990

1362
01:49:44,890 --> 01:49:59,110

1363
01:50:02,970 --> 01:50:04,890
it's all about keeping your charge for headbutt.

1364
01:50:08,050 --> 01:50:08,570
Nice.

1365
01:50:09,730 --> 01:50:10,510
That's looking right.

1366
01:50:10,890 --> 01:50:11,790
Get out of here!

1367
01:50:19,010 --> 01:50:19,530
Oh.

1368
01:50:21,210 --> 01:50:21,730
Oh.

1369
01:50:27,510 --> 01:50:29,230
Oh, she fucking...

1370
01:50:29,230 --> 01:50:30,170
She's using her brain.

1371
01:50:30,430 --> 01:50:31,310
I don't like that.

1372
01:50:32,330 --> 01:50:32,630
No.

1373
01:50:37,110 --> 01:50:38,670
What the fuck?

1374
01:50:39,830 --> 01:50:40,270
Get out.

1375
01:50:40,330 --> 01:50:40,730
Oh, fuck.

1376
01:50:40,810 --> 01:50:41,070
Oh, no.

1377
01:50:42,130 --> 01:50:58,030
yeah you still have your super nice get out oh no i don't have anything yeah when you don't have anything you have to try and jump the okay

1378
01:51:01,710 --> 01:51:17,130
i'm adapting though i'm figuring it out yeah i think like the supers have been really good now and the headbutt timing is a lot better now too okay i just need to figure this out And then I'd be unstoppable.

1379
01:51:21,480 --> 01:51:22,180
Who's her?

1380
01:51:23,340 --> 01:51:24,040
That's my.

1381
01:51:24,340 --> 01:51:27,680
I don't know if she... Yeah, I don't think she was out when you played Sage Emslam last time.

1382
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:28,360
Oh, okay.

1383
01:51:28,680 --> 01:51:31,060
Wait, is she... Is anyone playing her?

1384
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:32,580
Is it any of my matchups?

1385
01:51:32,940 --> 01:51:34,200
I don't think so.

1386
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:39,120
That's fucking... Oh, never mind.

1387
01:51:40,460 --> 01:51:41,460
That... Oh...

1388
01:51:42,020 --> 01:51:43,060
That's fucking right.

1389
01:51:45,220 --> 01:51:46,020
That's right.

1390
01:51:48,040 --> 01:51:56,740
that's oh shit never mind it's okay and when they're burned out you can spam drive impact because they don't have it to do it back

1391
01:52:03,270 --> 01:52:22,450
haha oh shit yeah but she gets it back when you stun her on the wall like that but when you get the stun you can do a full combo so you do your heavy auto combo oh I see yeah that's right jump again but like I need you to get closer What the fuck?

1392
01:52:23,290 --> 01:52:24,510
What the fuck?

1393
01:52:24,630 --> 01:52:26,490
Yeah, the fan bouncing on you.

1394
01:52:26,630 --> 01:52:28,790
What the fuck am I looking at?

1395
01:52:29,830 --> 01:52:32,110
Oh, I fucked up.

1396
01:52:32,130 --> 01:52:32,850
It's okay.

1397
01:52:33,930 --> 01:52:34,250
Oh.

1398
01:52:35,950 --> 01:52:37,290
Wait, how do I dodge?

1399
01:52:37,430 --> 01:52:39,850
I just, I felt I couldn't jump that.

1400
01:52:40,310 --> 01:52:41,710
Yeah, you can't jump it.

1401
01:52:42,170 --> 01:52:44,370
When the bounce is on you, you just have to block.

1402
01:52:49,540 --> 01:52:50,340
It's crazy.

1403
01:52:56,090 --> 01:52:57,370
There you go.

1404
01:52:57,690 --> 01:52:57,730
Nice.

1405
01:53:00,630 --> 01:53:01,270
That's right.

1406
01:53:02,550 --> 01:53:04,430
Oh, okay.

1407
01:53:04,550 --> 01:53:05,010
That's cool.

1408
01:53:07,470 --> 01:53:07,790
Okay.

1409
01:53:08,190 --> 01:53:08,950
She's scared.

1410
01:53:10,210 --> 01:53:10,330
Yeah.

1411
01:53:11,310 --> 01:53:14,370
She saw me do the neutral and she got scared.

1412
01:53:15,470 --> 01:53:16,550
Yeah, I think that's what happened.

1413
01:53:17,530 --> 01:53:17,730
Yeah.

1414
01:53:19,330 --> 01:53:22,590
I think it's actually steaming Wait a minute.

1415
01:53:22,950 --> 01:53:24,890
I think online mode is off.

1416
01:53:27,870 --> 01:53:56,830

1417
01:53:58,930 --> 01:54:01,870
The moment I learn my fifth move, I'll be unstoppable.

1418
01:54:02,870 --> 01:54:06,310
Okay, I gotta be on this side though.

1419
01:54:08,310 --> 01:54:09,390
What the fuck?

1420
01:54:16,990 --> 01:54:18,030
Oh my god, please.

1421
01:54:24,250 --> 01:54:25,550
I lost my groove.

1422
01:54:35,460 --> 01:54:43,220
please you can press down a lot earlier than you're pressing it through the second one yeah but also you you might be holding up so i can't really tell

1423
01:54:49,100 --> 01:55:01,740
oh wait wait i got it i got it okay but it didn't hit but i got it yeah so that's where the steering comes in you gotta you gotta make sure it hits i thought i got it

1424
01:55:08,390 --> 01:55:08,830
Okay.

1425
01:55:09,550 --> 01:55:10,610
Oh my god, please.

1426
01:55:11,550 --> 01:55:12,090
Please, Honda.

1427
01:55:12,530 --> 01:55:13,430
Work with me.

1428
01:55:16,410 --> 01:55:17,350
Honda, please.

1429
01:55:22,870 --> 01:55:23,310
Honda.

1430
01:55:24,490 --> 01:55:25,890
We can do this, Honda.

1431
01:55:26,530 --> 01:55:27,810
We just got hit two in a row.

1432
01:55:28,790 --> 01:55:29,410
There we go.

1433
01:55:29,530 --> 01:55:30,730
Now maybe three in a row.

1434
01:55:31,190 --> 01:55:32,550
Oh my god, maybe four.

1435
01:55:32,610 --> 01:55:33,610
Okay, no, that's too much.

1436
01:55:33,970 --> 01:55:35,070
That's asking too much.

1437
01:55:35,950 --> 01:55:36,770
No, that was good though.

1438
01:55:41,750 --> 01:55:42,560
There you go.

1439
01:55:47,670 --> 01:55:53,830
Yeah, there's still a big gap between when you're like, um, inputting it and when you hold down though.

1440
01:55:54,170 --> 01:56:01,170
So if you can make that a bit smaller then you can get it to come out faster for the, like second one.

1441
01:56:01,170 --> 01:56:01,510
Oh my god.

1442
01:56:01,790 --> 01:56:07,410
These guys gotta shorten the gap.

1443
01:56:13,140 --> 01:56:13,580
No!

1444
01:56:15,880 --> 01:56:17,180
I was in the groove!

1445
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:19,100
Yeah, you had it.

1446
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:20,740
Oh my god.

1447
01:56:23,440 --> 01:56:24,300
Oh, Steam is back.

1448
01:56:24,460 --> 01:56:24,740
Nice.

1449
01:56:25,560 --> 01:56:26,680
Oh, that's a fast mage.

1450
01:56:27,060 --> 01:56:28,020
Yeah, what the heck?

1451
01:56:28,160 --> 01:56:30,520
Yeah, I was like, I've never seen it go that fast before.

1452
01:56:32,980 --> 01:56:33,920
Why do I go back online?

1453
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:38,880
Uh, go...

1454
01:56:38,880 --> 01:56:39,260
Um...

1455
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:41,580
Yeah, you can do it here.

1456
01:56:45,320 --> 01:56:46,140
Wait, what?

1457
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:47,580
Do you guys lie?

1458
01:56:48,260 --> 01:56:49,220
It's still a town.

1459
01:56:49,560 --> 01:56:50,160
Who was it?

1460
01:56:50,200 --> 01:56:51,220
Who's the one guy?

1461
01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:53,680
That's crazy.

1462
01:56:54,060 --> 01:56:54,780
Oh, my God.

1463
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:55,740
Who are you?

1464
01:56:56,020 --> 01:56:58,000
Sir, I wish you were back.

1465
01:56:58,300 --> 01:56:58,840
Oh, wait, we're back.

1466
01:56:58,940 --> 01:56:59,580
Okay, no, never mind.

1467
01:56:59,700 --> 01:57:00,340
He is telling the truth.

1468
01:57:01,340 --> 01:57:01,720
You're fine.

1469
01:57:01,800 --> 01:57:03,480
I was going to ban you, but you're okay now.

1470
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:08,460
No one.

1471
01:57:08,720 --> 01:57:09,380
One guy is me.

1472
01:57:15,170 --> 01:57:17,070
I was already at it.

1473
01:57:17,910 --> 01:57:18,950
You know what?

1474
01:57:20,490 --> 01:57:23,450
I'm feeling a little dangerous.

1475
01:57:25,450 --> 01:57:27,230
Oh, that's not what I want to do.

1476
01:57:28,190 --> 01:57:28,230
Oh.

1477
01:57:37,810 --> 01:57:38,370
Alright.

1478
01:57:40,070 --> 01:57:41,510
You don't need to hit triangle.

1479
01:57:41,810 --> 01:57:42,190
Oh.

1480
01:57:42,410 --> 01:57:43,690
It worked though.

1481
01:57:43,690 --> 01:57:45,230
It was giving me my groove.

1482
01:57:46,110 --> 01:57:46,590
It does work.

1483
01:57:48,090 --> 01:57:50,070
I was vibing with the triangle.

1484
01:57:50,390 --> 01:57:51,250
Oh no.

1485
01:57:51,690 --> 01:57:52,570
Oh no.

01:59:09,550 --> 01:59:10,470
Oh, no.

1500
01:59:11,010 --> 01:59:11,650
It's okay.

1501
01:59:12,010 --> 01:59:12,570
He knows.

1502
01:59:14,650 --> 01:59:15,930
Oh, no.

1503
01:59:16,890 --> 01:59:17,370
Oh, no.

1504
01:59:17,510 --> 01:59:19,070
My dog is not happy, too.

1505
01:59:20,990 --> 01:59:21,970
Oh, my God.

1506
01:59:22,150 --> 01:59:22,770
You freak.

1507
01:59:24,110 --> 01:59:25,330
That's right.

1508
01:59:30,390 --> 01:59:32,130
My dog's cheering me on!

1509
01:59:32,890 --> 01:59:33,810
That's right!

1510
01:59:34,330 --> 01:59:35,670
I broke your win streak!

1511
01:59:36,770 --> 01:59:37,670
Fuck you!

1512
01:59:38,450 --> 01:59:39,350
And I leave!

1513
01:59:40,970 --> 01:59:42,390
Yeah, you're really mad now.

1514
01:59:43,450 --> 01:59:43,970
No!

1515
01:59:44,430 --> 01:59:44,790
No!

1516
01:59:45,990 --> 01:59:48,250
That's right, I win with the power of my dog.

1517
01:59:49,410 --> 01:59:49,730
Hmm.

1518
01:59:50,970 --> 01:59:52,150
That's fucking right.

1519
01:59:52,710 --> 01:59:54,330
No win streak for you.

1520
01:59:56,890 --> 01:59:57,410
Alright.

1521
01:59:57,830 --> 01:59:59,510
One day I'll be able to use this move.

1522
02:00:01,450 --> 02:00:03,370
Wait, I figured this out.

1523
02:00:05,230 --> 02:00:06,670
I mean, I feel like you've got it.

1524
02:00:06,790 --> 02:00:09,110
I got it in theory.

1525
02:00:12,050 --> 02:00:13,250
Only in theory.

1526
02:00:15,550 --> 02:00:16,710
Oh my god, the famine.

1527
02:00:17,550 --> 02:00:19,010
Yeah, they can't do that to Honda.

1528
02:00:22,430 --> 02:00:24,650
Oh, wait, that's a nice costume.

1529
02:00:29,660 --> 02:00:30,560

1531
02:00:57,250 --> 02:01:17,000
that's right the two moves i just need to know yeah you don't need very much yeah also when you have like a big life lead you can all just like send back a lot more you don't have to go in too much oh come on you know you want to jump come on come on

1532
02:01:21,810 --> 02:01:26,930

What the fuck?

1536
02:01:54,140 --> 02:01:55,640
Wait, what the fuck?

1537
02:01:59,780 --> 02:02:01,940
Yeah, you can wait for your drivers to come back.

1538
02:02:04,780 --> 02:02:04,980
Oh.

1539
02:02:08,540 --> 02:02:09,420
There you go.

1540
02:02:09,700 --> 02:02:11,800
Yay, that's a real silver player.

1541
02:02:11,980 --> 02:02:13,280
Let's go.

1542
02:02:16,380 --> 02:02:17,220
Oh, he left?

1543
02:02:18,280 --> 02:03:20,860
i win i win the mental game see when i fight real silver players i have a chance they're all smurfed yeah yeah everyone i lose to are smurfing that's how it goes no that makes sense yeah yeah like why would a new player know how to block that doesn't make sense also i don't think i explained supers but uh if you hold a direction it gives you a different super so if you hold so like if you press super with like nothing it gives you like your level one but if you hold down it gives you level three what control is that like down and then i think r3 oh okay okay i got it that makes sense oh that's right oh sorry that's right that's right

1544
02:03:40,300 --> 02:03:51,800
okay yeah i mean i feel like you're getting the hang of it yeah event wait okay i could test this out because she's not that good Oh shit, never mind!

1545
02:03:53,740 --> 02:03:55,820
If all else fails!

1546
02:04:01,460 --> 02:04:02,500
Oh shit.

1547
02:04:03,660 --> 02:04:05,460
She grabbed me.

1548
02:04:08,460 --> 02:04:08,860
Oh whoa.

1549
02:04:10,160 --> 02:04:10,900
What are you doing here?

1550
02:04:12,080 --> 02:04:13,220
Alright, okay.

1551
02:04:15,880 --> 02:04:17,160
Well, I mean that works too.

1552
02:04:19,780 --> 02:04:21,520
Oh wait, I'm on the other side.

1553
02:04:21,700 --> 02:04:22,540
Come

1554
02:04:25,630 --> 02:04:26,790
on!

1555
02:04:30,190 --> 02:04:30,530
Hello?

1556
02:04:32,570 --> 02:04:33,450
Oh no.

1557
02:04:37,450 --> 02:04:39,930
Eventually one of the torpedo will hit.

1558
02:04:40,630 --> 02:04:41,510
Yeah, one of them.

1559
02:04:42,130 --> 02:04:43,050
They're too easy.

1560
02:04:43,370 --> 02:04:44,450
I got a new challenge.

1561
02:04:52,450 --> 02:04:55,230
Alright, one day I will use this.

1562
02:04:59,270 --> 02:05:23,710
all right if i do it enough it will hit my head i'll realize how what's how to do it yeah i think you're just not charging long enough because like if you see the numbers on the left it says like you're holding down for like a certain amount of time it has to be at least 50 i think oh okay oh

1563
02:05:27,130 --> 02:05:27,570
50.

1564
02:05:29,030 --> 02:05:30,130
god that feels so long

1565
02:05:33,370 --> 02:05:51,310
like the first one you have to wait a long time but the other ones because you can charge while you're in the air like oh okay but those ones where you just get the heavy punch you're pressing the heavy too early yeah you see how it says they're pressing the punch like before the up yeah

1566
02:06:01,010 --> 02:06:04,270
get in here oh no never mind please leave

1567
02:06:07,470 --> 02:06:08,130
It's big slop!

1568
02:06:08,410 --> 02:06:08,950
Okay, thank god.

1569
02:06:09,290 --> 02:06:10,030
It's not big slop.

1570
02:06:11,890 --> 02:06:12,770
You don't like that guy?

1571
02:06:13,110 --> 02:06:14,350
No, fuck that guy.

1572
02:06:15,910 --> 02:06:17,430
Go back to his real Elo.

1573
02:06:22,270 --> 02:06:23,630
That's goddamn right.

1574
02:06:23,790 --> 02:06:24,710
Get out of here!

1575
02:06:24,810 --> 02:06:25,630
That's for blocking.

1576
02:06:31,410 --> 02:06:32,130
That's right.

1577
02:06:34,010 --> 02:06:35,550
We ain't blocking here.

1578
02:06:35,770 --> 02:06:36,810
Oh, wait, fuck, okay.

1579
02:06:37,030 --> 02:06:38,890
Maybe a little block wouldn't hurt.

1580
02:06:39,650 --> 02:06:40,410
Yeah, there's a way.

1581
02:06:45,610 --> 02:06:46,130
Yeah.

1582
02:06:49,750 --> 02:06:51,290
Oh shit, sorry.

1583
02:06:58,540 --> 02:07:00,640
Oh no, oh no.

1584
02:07:01,860 --> 02:07:02,100
Yeah!

1585
02:07:03,360 --> 02:07:04,900
Got it back first.

1586
02:07:07,940 --> 02:07:08,840
All right, maybe.

1587
02:07:10,960 --> 02:07:11,240
Yeah!

1588
02:07:11,360 --> 02:07:13,520
Oh shit, what's the point if he can block that?

1589
02:07:18,220 --> 02:07:19,060
He's adapting.

1590
02:07:21,700 --> 02:07:22,820
Am I fighting game?

1591
02:07:34,390 --> 02:07:35,350
Oh, God.

1592
02:07:37,250 --> 02:07:38,070
Yeah, that's what you get.

1593
02:07:38,810 --> 02:07:39,790
Get out of here.

1594
02:07:40,450 --> 02:07:40,930
That's right.

1595
02:07:40,970 --> 02:07:42,490
I got my level three now.

1596
02:07:45,890 --> 02:07:47,670
He doesn't die, does he?

1597
02:07:48,150 --> 02:07:48,910
No, not yet.

1598
02:07:49,050 --> 02:07:50,230
But you can try to do a butt slam.

1599
02:07:50,810 --> 02:07:51,450
Close it out.

1600
02:07:52,110 --> 02:07:52,390
Alright.

1601
02:07:56,230 --> 02:08:06,470

1604
02:09:05,830 --> 02:09:07,930
Oh, I thought he got that.

1605
02:09:10,130 --> 02:09:13,430
Oh my god, what is he doing to me?

1606
02:09:13,850 --> 02:09:15,050
It's okay, doesn't matter.

1607
02:09:15,990 --> 02:09:16,850
Zero bar advantage.

1608
02:09:20,390 --> 02:09:21,310
All right.

1609
02:09:23,290 --> 02:09:23,770
Ow!

1610
02:09:24,290 --> 02:09:26,190
All they do is just block it!

1611
02:09:29,350 --> 02:09:30,690
That's fucking right.

1612
02:09:32,850 --> 02:09:34,230
Oh shit.

1613
02:09:35,250 --> 02:09:36,610
Oh my god.

1614
02:09:37,110 --> 02:09:38,190
He doesn't like it.

1615
02:09:38,650 --> 02:09:38,870
No!

1616
02:09:39,650 --> 02:09:39,650
No!

1617
02:09:40,250 --> 02:09:40,770
No!

1618
02:09:41,330 --> 02:09:41,330
Please!

1619
02:09:42,030 --> 02:09:43,390
I'm trying to... No!

1620
02:09:46,150 --> 02:09:47,330
You're going to distract him.

1621
02:09:48,010 --> 02:09:48,910
He knows!

1622
02:09:51,590 --> 02:09:52,190
Oh no.

1623
02:09:53,290 --> 02:09:54,610
Oh my no!

1624
02:09:55,490 --> 02:09:55,710
No!

1625
02:09:56,650 --> 02:09:59,750
Can't get another noise complain.

1626
02:10:05,720 --> 02:10:07,000
That's fucking right.

1627
02:10:09,400 --> 02:10:10,700
That's fucking right.

1628
02:10:20,150 --> 02:10:22,510
I didn't even realize I don't block down.

1629
02:10:27,330 --> 02:10:28,170
Get out of here.

1630
02:10:34,090 --> 02:10:35,050
Oh, no.

1631
02:10:40,890 --> 02:10:41,490
That's right.

1632
02:10:43,070 --> 02:10:43,790
I did.

1633
02:10:46,570 --> 02:10:48,490
I have the advantage.

1634
02:10:50,810 --> 02:10:51,830
Yeah, you're climbing.

1635
02:10:52,610 --> 02:10:54,890
Goodbye, Kiki, because I need to feed my dog.

1636
02:10:55,130 --> 02:10:55,650
Give me a sec.

1637
02:10:56,070 --> 02:10:56,710
All right.

1638
02:11:11,910 --> 02:11:12,550
All right.

1639
02:11:13,010 --> 02:11:13,570
Oh, no!

1640
02:11:15,690 --> 02:11:16,830
The guy left.

1641
02:11:17,130 --> 02:11:19,370
Oh, he also left.

1642
02:11:20,710 --> 02:11:21,050
Yeah.

1643
02:11:21,430 --> 02:11:24,230
Wait, so like, how do I use this efficiently?

1644
02:11:24,770 --> 02:11:28,390
Because I used it twice, but both times the guy blocked me.

1645
02:11:29,470 --> 02:11:32,490
Even if it gets blocked you can keep doing it kind of.

1646
02:11:32,490 --> 02:11:33,070
Oh, okay.

1647
02:11:33,870 --> 02:11:35,450
This is my rank up.

1648
02:11:35,770 --> 02:11:42,750
Please ma'am Please I have a tournament you don't

1649
02:11:52,130 --> 02:11:54,910
That's fucking right throw it out of oh wait never mind

1650
02:12:01,230 --> 02:12:07,290
Get out of here ma'am Oh, I That's right.

1651
02:12:07,930 --> 02:12:08,290
Oh shit

1652
02:12:12,030 --> 02:12:13,230
She jumps?

1653
02:12:14,150 --> 02:12:14,770
That's okay.

1654
02:12:26,710 --> 02:12:27,970
Do I get mine first?

1655
02:12:28,230 --> 02:12:28,610
Yay!

1656
02:12:29,790 --> 02:12:31,330
Get out of here!

1657
02:12:32,790 --> 02:12:33,710
That's right.

1658
02:12:34,910 --> 02:12:36,750
You wish you were built like this.

1659
02:12:37,570 --> 02:12:37,790
Hmm.

1660
02:12:44,920 --> 02:12:45,820
Oh, what the heck?

1661
02:12:46,060 --> 02:12:47,140
I don't know what I did.

1662
02:12:48,720 --> 02:12:50,000
That looked cool.

1663
02:12:54,120 --> 02:12:55,460
That's funky right.

1664
02:12:56,500 --> 02:12:58,000
Oh, I thought I got that off.

1665
02:12:58,340 --> 02:12:59,040
Oh, no.

1666
02:12:59,860 --> 02:13:00,300
It's okay.

1667
02:13:01,040 --> 02:13:02,600
It's not actually that much damage.

1668
02:13:04,560 --> 02:13:05,500
That's good.

1669
02:13:11,790 --> 02:13:12,230
Oh.

1670
02:13:15,360 --> 02:13:15,920
No.

1671
02:13:16,600 --> 02:13:16,840
Oh.

1672
02:13:18,960 --> 02:13:21,100
Okay, you have three bars and she has zero.

1673
02:13:22,020 --> 02:13:22,320
Okay.

1674
02:13:23,120 --> 02:13:24,340
Gotta be able to get that.

1675
02:13:25,180 --> 02:13:25,800
Get it off.

1676
02:13:27,940 --> 02:13:39,640
like right now yeah I think it's okay to do that like even when you don't get the GI yeah just stick around sometimes throw it randomly

1677
02:13:43,680 --> 02:13:45,580
oh that's not cool

1678
02:13:48,660 --> 02:13:55,780
that's right oh that's not good oh no oh no

1679
02:14:00,350 --> 02:14:02,130
Get out of here.

1683
02:14:11,610 --> 02:14:12,910
Level two!

1684
02:14:14,110 --> 02:14:14,530
Goodbye.

1685
02:14:14,890 --> 02:14:15,890

1686
02:14:20,660 --> 02:14:21,300
Yippee!

1687
02:14:22,840 --> 02:14:23,140
Okay.

1688
02:14:24,060 --> 02:14:26,420
I still need to figure this jumping thing out.

1689
02:14:28,260 --> 02:14:29,620
Or is this guy?

1690
02:14:32,660 --> 02:14:34,980
Oh shit, he's also gonna rank up.

1691
02:14:36,840 --> 02:14:38,080
He thinks I'm a splurf.

1692
02:14:38,240 --> 02:14:39,000
Little does he know?

1693
02:14:40,500 --> 02:14:41,360

1694
02:14:41,540 --> 02:14:42,140
Oh, fuck.

1695
02:14:42,660 --> 02:14:43,320
Little do I know.

1696
02:14:45,600 --> 02:14:46,580
Oh my god.

1697
02:14:47,500 --> 02:14:49,780

1698
02:14:50,340 --> 02:14:51,840
Oh my god.

02:14:52,260 --> 02:14:53,940
Who broke your win streak?

1700
02:15:00,710 --> 02:15:01,770
Jesus Christ.

1701
02:15:04,670 --> 02:15:05,230
Um.

1702
02:15:05,570 --> 02:15:16,290

02:16:12,630 --> 02:16:13,190
I...

1709
02:16:13,190 --> 02:16:15,050
Oh, I'm gonna make him.

1710
02:16:15,290 --> 02:16:16,710
He's gonna see me think.

1711
02:16:17,690 --> 02:16:18,730
Oh, oh, and he gave...

1712
02:16:18,730 --> 02:16:19,610
I won.

1713
02:16:20,390 --> 02:16:21,190
Yeah, you did win.

1714
02:16:24,030 --> 02:16:25,670
He wasn't patient enough.

1715
02:16:27,930 --> 02:16:29,970
I would have rematched him if he waited.

1716
02:16:36,150 --> 02:16:36,710
Hello.

1717
02:16:37,230 --> 02:16:37,630
Yama?

1718
02:16:40,370 --> 02:16:41,250
Round one.

1719
02:16:52,150 --> 02:16:53,110
Oh shit.

1720
02:16:55,970 --> 02:16:56,770
That's messed up.

1721
02:16:58,250 --> 02:16:59,370
What the fuck?

1722
02:16:59,550 --> 02:17:00,410
Oh, she's on Modern.

1723
02:17:01,830 --> 02:17:02,010
Yay.

1724
02:17:05,970 --> 02:17:07,770
Okay, maybe I should...

1725
02:17:07,770 --> 02:17:07,930
Oh.

1726
02:17:13,050 --> 02:17:15,070
Oh, what the fuck happened to me?

1727
02:17:16,090 --> 02:17:16,770
That's okay.

1728
02:17:16,950 --> 02:17:17,950
We both...

1729
02:17:19,070 --> 02:17:20,070
Okay, never mind.

1730
02:17:20,210 --> 02:17:20,930
It's not okay anymore.

1731
02:17:20,950 --> 02:17:21,310
anymore.

1732
02:17:22,090 --> 02:17:23,090
That's not okay.

1733
02:17:23,750 --> 02:17:24,150
Yeah, that's right.

1734
02:17:26,230 --> 02:17:27,570
Oh my god.

1735
02:17:35,250 --> 02:17:35,490
Yeah.

1736
02:17:36,250 --> 02:17:39,010
Oh, she won't let me do that charge.

1737
02:17:41,190 --> 02:17:42,570
What's wrong with you?

1738
02:17:44,550 --> 02:17:45,230
Oh.

1739
02:17:49,620 --> 02:17:51,020
Oh my god.

1740
02:17:51,300 --> 02:17:51,620

02:17:52,140 --> 02:17:53,160
Oh my god.

1742
02:17:53,540 --> 02:17:54,120
That's okay.

1743
02:17:54,280 --> 02:17:55,600

02:19:19,990 --> 02:19:20,870
That might be bad.

1751
02:19:21,570 --> 02:19:22,750
Oh that is very bad.

1752
02:19:25,330 --> 02:19:27,450
I'll give her a hug though.

1753
02:19:29,210 --> 02:19:31,590
You don't need to do your EX headbut like when they're waking up.

1754
02:19:32,410 --> 02:20:05,910
basically the same as your regular headbutt then it's only when the something gets blocked you can do it oh do i not use it for match like mixup though no because it's like it it's just basically a punishable version of your regular headbutt i see yeah for mixup you do that yeah the command grab let's get out of here that's a congruent Give me my ring cup.

02:20:22,700 --> 02:20:23,580
That's right.

02:20:23,900 --> 02:20:25,100
I need to farm you.

02:20:25,900 --> 02:20:26,780

1761
02:20:27,500 --> 02:20:28,740
Oh my god, maybe she'll find me.

1762
02:20:29,820 --> 02:20:31,580
It's like she adapted to my playstyle.

1763
02:20:32,820 --> 02:20:33,960
I don't think so.

1764
02:20:35,640 --> 02:20:36,100
Ha ha ha.

1765
02:20:39,100 --> 02:20:41,840
My coach said, you don't know what you're doing.

1766
02:20:44,760 --> 02:20:48,040
Oh, wait, I messed that up.

1767
02:20:53,090 --> 02:20:54,870
You can do your own combo, so.

1768
02:20:55,730 --> 02:20:59,390
When they're like wall spotted like that after the DI, you can still do your combo.

1769
02:20:59,950 --> 02:21:01,750
I'm doing like, oh, the O combo?

1770
02:21:03,330 --> 02:21:05,290
Yeah, the O combo.

1773
02:22:32,560 --> 02:22:33,640

02:22:59,880 --> 02:23:00,340
Oh no.

1777
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:02,300
You think I don't know how to break that?

1778
02:23:03,100 --> 02:23:04,780
That's right, my turn!

1779
02:23:08,750 --> 02:23:10,050
Oh wait, maybe it is.

1780
02:23:11,690 --> 02:23:12,590
Get out!

1781
02:23:14,450 --> 02:23:15,750
How do I...

1782
02:23:15,750 --> 02:23:17,030
How do I do that grab again?

1783
02:23:17,110 --> 02:23:18,190
I do that by mashing.

1784
02:23:19,130 --> 02:23:20,590
This is down and special.

1785
02:23:21,850 --> 02:23:22,650
Yeah, that one.

1786
02:23:24,530 --> 02:23:27,350
Sometimes, like, it works because I just...

1787
02:23:27,930 --> 02:23:28,250
Yeah.

1788
02:23:28,510 --> 02:23:30,270
It's like my SOS.

1789
02:23:34,960 --> 02:23:35,280
Oh.

1790
02:23:36,260 --> 02:23:37,040
It's okay.

1791
02:23:39,820 --> 02:23:41,740
I know all about you, Kami.

1792
02:23:41,940 --> 02:23:43,120
All you do is jump.

1793
02:23:45,100 --> 02:23:45,480
Oh.

1794
02:23:57,170 --> 02:23:57,770
Okay.

1795
02:23:58,290 --> 02:23:59,530
I'm downloaded.

1796
02:23:59,770 --> 02:24:00,650
I'm in her head!

1797
02:24:01,070 --> 02:24:02,210
I'm in her head!

1798
02:24:02,550 --> 02:24:05,150
And now I'll leave, because now she'll hate me forever.

1799
02:24:07,730 --> 02:24:08,530
Yeah, that's smart.

1800
02:24:09,430 --> 02:24:13,550
She'll wish, she'll always try to queue up trying to find me.

1801
02:24:15,410 --> 02:24:16,530
Oh shit!

1802
02:24:17,250 --> 02:24:19,670
The match of the century.

1803
02:24:20,930 --> 02:24:23,390
This is the first beef I've seen.

1804
02:24:27,570 --> 02:24:28,590
Oh no.

1807
02:25:12,110 --> 02:25:14,830
Oh my god, I used to do that all the time too.

1808
02:25:18,450 --> 02:25:21,290
Oh, not the Siberian bear hug!

1809
02:25:22,890 --> 02:25:23,770
Oh no!

1810
02:25:26,650 --> 02:25:28,050
I think he...

1811
02:25:32,030 --> 02:25:33,530
That's fucking right, get out of here.

1812
02:25:34,690 --> 02:25:35,430
Oh my god.

1813
02:25:39,910 --> 02:25:40,470

1814
02:25:40,470 --> 02:25:41,030
No!

1815
02:25:41,290 --> 02:25:41,650
No!

1816
02:25:45,270 --> 02:25:46,430
I don't know.

1817
02:25:47,590 --> 02:25:48,630
I'm thinking.

02:25:50,590 --> 02:25:51,630
No, I have to learn.

1819
02:25:54,050 --> 02:25:56,290
You may have to do some butt slams.

1820
02:25:57,190 --> 02:25:57,830
Oh no.

1821
02:25:59,870 --> 02:26:00,210
Okay.

1822
02:26:04,550 --> 02:26:06,690

Oh, that's fine.

I won without...

1830
02:27:20,770 --> 02:27:24,010
I won... I won because he didn't get a perfect out of me.

1831
02:27:25,010 --> 02:27:25,950
Yeah, that is a win.

1832
02:27:26,350 --> 02:27:27,110
That's a win.

1833
02:27:27,390 --> 02:27:28,290
That's a win.

1834
02:27:28,870 --> 02:27:31,190
Mentally, that's a win for me.

1835
02:27:38,030 --> 02:27:38,770
Oh, shit.

1836
02:27:39,050 --> 02:27:39,250
Okay.

1837
02:27:43,210 --> 02:27:44,070
Good practice.

1838
02:27:44,330 --> 02:27:44,770
Good practice.

1839
02:27:45,010 --> 02:27:47,290
Oh my god, she's so many points higher than me.

1840
02:27:56,060 --> 02:27:58,020
Are you trying to fuck with me?

1841
02:27:58,140 --> 02:28:00,060
Like, are you not dodging on purpose?

1842
02:28:01,340 --> 02:28:01,840
Like...

1843
02:28:01,840 --> 02:28:02,460
Oh shit.

1844
02:28:03,680 --> 02:28:04,840
Oh shit, give me a sec.

1845
02:28:05,520 --> 02:28:06,980
I'm not very good at platforming.

1846
02:28:12,980 --> 02:28:15,220
What is wrong with you?

1847
02:28:15,420 --> 02:28:17,400
Only I can spam moves.

1848
02:28:20,880 --> 02:28:21,380
Oh.

1849
02:28:23,980 --> 02:28:25,320
Get out!

1850
02:28:26,240 --> 02:28:26,700
Nice.

1851
02:28:27,880 --> 02:28:30,480
I had it with you.

1852
02:28:33,500 --> 02:28:36,460
Yeah, I wasn't dodging on purpose, guys.

1853
02:28:44,230 --> 02:28:44,570
Oh.

1854
02:28:47,860 --> 02:28:48,680
Oh no.

1855
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:52,120
Get out.

1856
02:28:54,800 --> 02:28:55,760
That's right!

1857
02:28:57,820 --> 02:28:58,700
Oh shit.

1858
02:29:04,100 --> 02:29:04,620
What?

1859
02:29:05,920 --> 02:29:06,660
She can do that?

1860
02:29:06,680 --> 02:29:08,100
That's where I hit you at the other time.

1861
02:29:08,200 --> 02:29:09,500
She can...

1862
02:29:09,500 --> 02:29:11,600
Holy shit, what is she doing?

1863
02:29:12,780 --> 02:29:12,840
What?

1864
02:29:18,580 --> 02:29:20,440
Get out of here!

1865
02:29:21,340 --> 02:29:22,500
I think she's dead actually.

1866
02:29:23,320 --> 02:29:24,000
Oh, okay.

1867
02:29:24,700 --> 02:29:25,740
What the fuck?

1868
02:29:26,140 --> 02:29:27,440
How did I get the reset?

1869
02:29:28,200 --> 02:29:29,720
Yeah, he's got to mash harder.

1870
02:29:30,080 --> 02:29:31,500
Oh, nice.

1871
02:29:36,100 --> 02:29:37,360
Oh my god.

1872
02:29:38,560 --> 02:29:39,620
That's your clip of the day.

1873
02:29:44,710 --> 02:29:46,290
Get out of here.

1874
02:29:48,870 --> 02:29:49,670
That's right.

1875
02:29:54,620 --> 02:29:55,220
Okay.

1876
02:29:56,540 --> 02:29:56,760
Okay.

1877
02:29:57,680 --> 02:29:58,860
Oh, I wanted to do that.

1878
02:29:58,940 --> 02:30:00,660
I was trying to charge it up.

1879
02:30:02,400 --> 02:30:02,560
Oh.

1880
02:30:03,780 --> 02:30:04,820
I like that.

1881
02:30:06,060 --> 02:30:06,660
Okay.

1882
02:30:06,680 --> 02:30:07,580
Oh, no.

1883
02:30:07,780 --> 02:30:08,880
Wait, she's doing combos.

1884
02:30:09,240 --> 02:30:09,660
Don't wait.

1885
02:30:10,420 --> 02:30:11,080
How do I get out?

1886
02:30:12,560 --> 02:30:14,740
Yeah, she seems to know some combos.

1887
02:30:17,240 --> 02:30:18,420
Her is dead.

1888
02:30:18,620 --> 02:30:19,600
How did she do that?

1889
02:30:29,500 --> 02:30:30,500
That's right.

1890
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:32,400
I got level three, girl.

1891
02:30:33,400 --> 02:30:34,380
Get out of here.

1892
02:30:39,440 --> 02:30:40,940
I don't need combos.

1893
02:30:41,180 --> 02:30:41,880
I have auto.

1894
02:30:45,770 --> 02:30:46,250
Yeah.

1895
02:30:49,810 --> 02:30:50,390
That was a good perfect.

1896
02:30:51,770 --> 02:30:53,490
I don't know how I did it.

1897
02:30:58,370 --> 02:30:58,830
Oh shit.

1898
02:31:00,270 --> 02:31:00,790
Oh shit.

1899
02:31:01,090 --> 02:31:01,570
Oh shit!

1900
02:31:02,750 --> 02:31:04,110
That was so fast!

1901
02:31:08,510 --> 02:31:09,110
Um...

1902
02:31:10,290 --> 02:31:10,890
Um...

1903
02:31:10,890 --> 02:31:14,370
There you go.

1904
02:31:17,970 --> 02:31:18,710
There you go.

1905
02:31:27,810 --> 02:31:28,110
Oh no!

1906
02:31:28,410 --> 02:31:29,270
I'm in a bubble!

1907
02:31:30,450 --> 02:31:30,970
Okay.

1908
02:31:31,970 --> 02:31:32,950
I got you now!

1909
02:31:33,850 --> 02:31:35,210
Get out of here!

1910
02:31:36,390 --> 02:31:36,790
Yay!

1911
02:31:38,430 --> 02:31:40,210
I got a friend request too!

1912
02:31:46,710 --> 02:31:47,630
Okay, this is it.

1913
02:31:47,730 --> 02:31:48,190
This is good.

1914
02:31:48,430 --> 02:31:48,730
This is good.

1915
02:31:48,830 --> 02:31:50,890
I still don't know how to do this, but this is good.

1916
02:31:52,130 --> 02:31:54,710
I don't know how to put that in in rank.

1917
02:31:58,590 --> 02:32:03,990
Yeah, if you're just holding down and back, like you're charging both butt slam and headbutt too.

1918
02:32:04,290 --> 02:32:08,750
So if you see them jump at you, you can just I could do both buttons?

1919
02:32:10,310 --> 02:32:10,570
Yeah.

1920
02:32:11,590 --> 02:32:13,890
Okay, that didn't work out so well for me, though.

1921
02:32:14,250 --> 02:32:15,410
Oh my god, this guy...

1922
02:32:15,410 --> 02:32:16,190
Oh my god.

1923
02:32:16,630 --> 02:32:17,090
Wait.

1924
02:32:17,810 --> 02:32:18,210
Wait.

1925
02:32:18,710 --> 02:32:19,190
Please.

1926
02:32:20,670 --> 02:32:21,550
Get up.

1927
02:32:23,550 --> 02:32:24,990
Oh my god, he knows how to jump.

1928
02:32:29,010 --> 02:32:29,670
Oh no.

1929
02:32:38,890 --> 02:32:40,830
Oh my god, I'm trying to grab.

1930
02:32:42,790 --> 02:32:44,590
Nice try.

1931
02:32:48,430 --> 02:32:49,390
Okay.

1932
02:32:50,850 --> 02:32:54,270
Oh shit!

1933
02:32:55,310 --> 02:32:57,130
Use the wrong button there.

1934
02:33:00,090 --> 02:33:02,370
Oh my god he keeps jumping like a freak!

1935
02:33:04,850 --> 02:33:06,190
Get out!

1936
02:33:06,670 --> 02:33:07,590
I like that.

1937
02:33:17,240 --> 02:33:17,820
Okay.

1938
02:33:17,820 --> 02:33:20,000
But I'm doing it.

1939
02:33:21,940 --> 02:33:22,700
My turn.

1940
02:33:23,520 --> 02:33:23,640
Oh.

1941
02:33:25,140 --> 02:33:26,600
Okay, maybe your turn.

1942
02:33:27,740 --> 02:33:27,920
Oh.

1943
02:33:28,420 --> 02:33:30,460
Okay, yeah, it is your turn.

1944
02:33:30,860 --> 02:33:32,580
It is your turn, I guess.

1945
02:33:33,560 --> 02:33:34,640
No, that's fine.

1946
02:33:40,100 --> 02:33:41,100
That's okay.

1947
02:33:43,360 --> 02:33:44,000
Yeah.

1948
02:33:45,460 --> 02:33:46,100
Oh,

1949
02:33:50,040 --> 02:33:50,300
shit.

1950
02:33:50,460 --> 02:33:50,700
One.

1951
02:33:50,920 --> 02:33:52,780
Oh, no, not again!

1952
02:33:56,220 --> 02:33:56,900
It's okay.

1953
02:33:56,920 --> 02:33:58,180
Okay, we know the matchup now, right?

1954
02:33:58,260 --> 02:33:59,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

1955
02:33:59,520 --> 02:34:00,800
I fought so many Kens.

1956
02:34:01,360 --> 02:34:02,320
It should be five.

1957
02:34:06,660 --> 02:34:09,500
Yeah, but then he's gonna be like, oh no, one bar Honda.

1958
02:34:09,700 --> 02:34:10,780
He's also scared.

1959
02:34:12,260 --> 02:34:12,700
Yeah.

1960
02:34:14,620 --> 02:34:15,700
What comes here?

1961
02:34:15,760 --> 02:34:16,260
Yeah, see?

1962
02:34:16,640 --> 02:34:18,440
Oh, no, one bar Honda.

1963
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:19,500
Oh, shit.

1964
02:34:20,880 --> 02:34:23,200
Oh my god, this is actually one bar Honda.

1965
02:34:23,440 --> 02:34:24,160
What is this?

1966
02:34:24,420 --> 02:34:26,220
I do not feel so good.

1967
02:34:26,600 --> 02:34:28,460
Yeah, 300 ping is crazy.

1968
02:34:31,340 --> 02:34:33,040
We're both suffering.

1969
02:34:33,280 --> 02:34:33,780
We suffered.

1970
02:34:34,060 --> 02:34:35,740
We know what we were getting into.

1971
02:34:36,120 --> 02:34:37,720
We killed Annie.

1972
02:34:41,860 --> 02:34:42,900
That's fucking right.

1973
02:34:47,540 --> 02:34:49,940
Let's drive impact there.

1974
02:34:53,780 --> 02:34:56,640
Oh my god, wait, he has the right idea.

1975
02:34:56,800 --> 02:34:58,400
How do I dodge her?

1976
02:34:59,600 --> 02:35:01,500
Oh my god.

1977
02:35:02,380 --> 02:35:03,320
Oh my god.

1978
02:35:03,320 --> 02:35:03,900
Oh my god.

1979
02:35:05,600 --> 02:35:06,840
There we go.

1980
02:35:07,300 --> 02:35:08,260
We did it.

1981
02:35:08,700 --> 02:35:10,680
We got close enough.

1982
02:35:14,340 --> 02:35:16,640
He's doing a lot of EXTPs.

1983
02:35:17,040 --> 02:35:17,880
You got Blackbeard.

1984
02:35:19,980 --> 02:35:22,480
I'm feeling like he's in the moon right now.

1985
02:35:24,740 --> 02:35:26,360
Oh my god!

1986
02:35:29,730 --> 02:35:30,130
It's okay.

1987
02:35:31,830 --> 02:35:33,790
Bro, he's molded by this ping.

1988
02:35:34,070 --> 02:35:35,110
I feel like he knows.

1989
02:35:35,850 --> 02:35:37,070
This is not his first rodeo.

1990
02:35:37,170 --> 02:35:38,090
This is probably why he practices it.

1991
02:35:38,470 --> 02:35:42,830
Yeah, this is not his first rodeo on this godforsaken ping.

1992
02:35:48,940 --> 02:35:49,900
That's fine.

1993
02:35:50,560 --> 02:35:51,740
We're out of here.

1994
02:35:53,220 --> 02:35:57,480
The guy with zero ping was easier than the guy with one ping.

1995
02:35:58,140 --> 02:35:58,740
Yeah.

1996
02:36:00,800 --> 02:36:05,340
No, he felt like it felt like he knew what he was doing in 300 ping.

1997
02:36:06,060 --> 02:36:07,500
I don't know how I feel about that.

1998
02:36:09,040 --> 02:36:11,700
Yeah, I think he has a strategy for that.

1999
02:36:13,140 --> 02:36:14,360
He's molded by it.

2000
02:36:14,760 --> 02:36:16,140
It was literally his only option.

2001
02:36:17,060 --> 02:36:17,060
Hello.

2002
02:36:17,500 --> 02:36:18,220
Hello, Ray.

2003
02:36:23,140 --> 02:36:23,400
What?

2004
02:36:25,720 --> 02:36:26,840
Oh, thank you.

2005
02:36:31,090 --> 02:36:31,630
That's right.

2006
02:36:36,520 --> 02:36:37,940
You're too close!

2007
02:36:43,300 --> 02:36:44,440
That's right!

2008
02:36:48,770 --> 02:36:50,170
Let's get out!

2009
02:36:51,930 --> 02:36:53,430
Get out of here!

2010
02:37:03,140 --> 02:37:03,380
Oh.

2011
02:37:13,390 --> 02:37:15,350
Oh, he anti-enemy.

2012
02:37:15,950 --> 02:37:16,870
He's messed up.

2013
02:37:18,090 --> 02:37:18,890
That's right.

2014
02:37:19,090 --> 02:37:20,370
I'll grab you back too.

2015
02:37:26,800 --> 02:37:27,180
Nice!

2016
02:37:28,020 --> 02:37:29,900
And then my combo.

2017
02:37:30,500 --> 02:37:31,110
One button.

2018
02:37:34,220 --> 02:37:34,460
Yay!

2019
02:37:35,540 --> 02:37:38,300
I didn't need to.

2020
02:37:38,460 --> 02:37:39,880
It's about the message.

2021
02:37:40,600 --> 02:37:40,740
Mm-hmm.

2022
02:37:43,480 --> 02:37:43,800
Yay!

2023
02:37:45,180 --> 02:37:46,400
It's easy.

2024
02:38:00,880 --> 02:38:03,140
Hey, it's not cool.

2025
02:38:03,160 --> 02:38:18,060
Oh my god, this is actually not cool Wait, wait a minute I don't like this She adapted, but I have it Um SOS

2026
02:38:24,290 --> 02:38:29,590
Okay JK Okay No SOS

2027
02:38:34,170 --> 02:38:37,530
Oh, what the fuck Yay

2028
02:38:41,650 --> 02:38:42,250
Okay.

2029
02:38:45,310 --> 02:38:47,390
Oh my god, that's hard too?

2030
02:38:50,090 --> 02:38:51,590
What is wrong with you?

2031
02:38:53,150 --> 02:38:54,110
Oh my gosh, I'm in the fire.

2032
02:38:54,490 --> 02:38:55,090

02:38:58,270 --> 02:38:58,710
Wait a minute.

2035
02:38:59,270 --> 02:39:00,270
She's not stopping.

2036
02:39:03,850 --> 02:39:04,850
Oh wait.

2037
02:39:05,190 --> 02:39:05,790
That's okay.

2038
02:39:06,290 --> 02:39:06,670
Um.

2039
02:39:08,010 --> 02:39:10,010
Yeah, I think you just have to hold your charge more.

2040
02:39:12,790 --> 02:39:12,890
Huh?

2041
02:39:14,490 --> 02:39:14,650

02:39:43,070 --> 02:39:46,650
Oh, she's getting- No!

I don't understand.

2048
02:39:51,770 --> 02:39:53,510
Yeah, that movie just had to block the whole thing.

2049
02:39:53,710 --> 02:39:55,150
You had to block it?

2050
02:39:55,770 --> 02:39:58,110
You might have to do a bit of blocking.

2051
02:39:59,990 --> 02:40:00,610
There we go.

2052
02:40:02,170 --> 02:40:03,610

Yeah, yeah, I saw her jump and I was like, that's it.

That's my one opportunity.

02:43:15,450 --> 02:43:17,570
I still don't know how to do this, though.

2083
02:43:21,050 --> 02:43:21,690
That's okay.

02:52:35,030 --> 02:52:36,130
I don't think I'm locking in.

2212
02:52:36,770 --> 02:52:37,330
I didn't.

2213
02:52:44,300 --> 02:52:44,580
My.

2214
02:52:46,060 --> 02:52:47,480
Oh my god, please.

2215
02:52:51,640 --> 02:52:52,040
Nice.

2216
02:52:55,460 --> 02:52:58,580
Like, like she just jumps away from me.

2217
02:53:03,550 --> 02:53:03,770
Yeah.

2218
02:53:05,270 --> 02:53:05,570
Whoa!

2219
02:53:06,450 --> 02:53:07,290
I am tired!

2220
02:53:08,850 --> 02:53:09,450
Unintentionally.

2221
02:53:10,310 --> 02:53:11,110
No, that was nice.

2222
02:53:11,130 --> 02:53:26,730
so all right slam dunk oh my god i thought i'm that

2223
02:53:30,910 --> 02:53:57,000
more oh oh oh no no no that is yeah get out yeah i did it yeah i think might be like but i did it yeah that was that was a legit win i think yeah

2224
02:54:04,260 --> 02:54:27,700
is maybe like meta i feel like everyone's playing her or she just yeah a little bit no she came out a while ago i think a lot of people just play her because she's she's just a great character oh wait what is the what's the best character currently um a lot of people say either like her or Bison or JP you love you.

2225
02:54:28,280 --> 02:54:34,140
It's not like super clear because like all the characters are pretty close.

2226
02:54:35,040 --> 02:54:41,160
What makes what makes JP so so good?

2227
02:54:42,660 --> 02:54:46,560
It's because like he just like deletes your drive gauge.

2228
02:54:47,580 --> 02:54:49,300
It's like what she's doing to me.

2229
02:54:51,160 --> 02:54:51,720
Yeah.

2230
02:54:53,480 --> 02:54:54,320
Please don't.

2231
02:54:56,120 --> 02:54:57,000
That's my- oh shit!

2232
02:54:57,260 --> 02:54:57,980
That's not right.

2233
02:55:00,220 --> 02:55:01,620
That's not okay.

2234
02:55:04,040 --> 02:55:06,560
Oh, we both got the same idea.

2235
02:55:08,460 --> 02:55:08,500
Oh.

2236
02:55:10,720 --> 02:55:11,720
That's my turn.

2237
02:55:12,340 --> 02:55:14,400
Holy shit, she does so much damage though.

2238
02:55:15,880 --> 02:55:17,140
Yeah, she does do a lot of damage.

2239
02:55:20,020 --> 02:55:20,580
Oh!

2240
02:55:20,580 --> 02:55:20,700
Oh!

2241
02:55:20,720 --> 02:55:23,760
Oh my god, this is why you're on a two-win streak.

2242
02:55:23,920 --> 02:55:25,080
Oh my god, this is why.

2243
02:55:27,500 --> 02:55:28,980
We've got three-win streak now.

2244
02:55:29,340 --> 02:55:30,300
Oh no!

2245
02:55:34,730 --> 02:55:36,490
First, she baited me.

2246
02:55:38,410 --> 02:55:39,670
Alright, I'll fight you again.

2247
02:55:41,290 --> 02:55:43,030
I'll let you have a four-win streak.

2248
02:55:43,150 --> 02:55:43,730
I'm less!

2249
02:55:44,550 --> 02:55:44,830
Oh.

2250
02:55:46,010 --> 02:55:47,570
I feel like she downloaded me.

2251
02:55:47,750 --> 02:55:48,390
I don't know how.

2252
02:55:49,870 --> 02:55:50,770
I don't think so.

2253
02:55:52,370 --> 02:55:52,930
What?

2254
02:55:55,130 --> 02:55:56,370
Oh, I don't know, that's bad.

2255
02:55:59,110 --> 02:55:59,750
Oh.

2256
02:56:00,450 --> 02:56:01,450
She knows.

2257
02:56:02,230 --> 02:56:04,370
She knows I'm fucked up right now.

2258
02:56:12,610 --> 02:56:13,410
Oh, oranges.

2259
02:56:13,750 --> 02:56:14,030
No!

2260
02:56:17,750 --> 02:56:19,470
Oh, she does so much.

2261
02:56:21,670 --> 02:56:23,650
That's right, I'm dodging that.

2262
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:30,640
Okay.

2263
02:56:30,960 --> 02:56:31,960
I don't know right here.

2264
02:56:34,140 --> 02:56:34,780
What?

2265
02:56:35,500 --> 02:56:38,480
I think she's downloading me.

2266
02:56:44,300 --> 02:56:44,980
Unless...

2267
02:56:49,100 --> 02:56:50,460
Unless...

2268
02:56:50,460 --> 02:56:54,780
What would I do now?

2269
02:56:55,460 --> 02:56:56,820
Surely not this move?

2270
02:56:57,760 --> 02:56:57,880
Oh.

2271
02:57:02,040 --> 02:57:02,160
Oh.

2272
02:57:10,230 --> 02:57:10,910
Nice.

2273
02:57:17,090 --> 02:57:18,990
You'll never know what comes next.

2274
02:57:19,650 --> 02:57:20,890
What would I do next?

2275
02:57:21,530 --> 02:57:22,010
Surely.

2276
02:57:22,470 --> 02:57:23,950
Oh, that's right.

2277
02:57:24,950 --> 02:57:25,910
Ha ha ha.

2278
02:57:25,930 --> 02:57:26,470
Oh, okay.

2279
02:57:26,930 --> 02:57:27,710
Ha ha ha.

2280
02:57:28,010 --> 02:57:28,630
Oh, shit.

2281
02:57:29,990 --> 02:57:30,910
I guess not.

2282
02:57:31,690 --> 02:57:32,490
That's okay.

2283
02:57:32,990 --> 02:57:34,650
I did a mix-up.

2284
02:57:37,250 --> 02:57:38,190
Oh, no.

2285
02:57:38,750 --> 02:57:39,230
Oh, no.

2286
02:57:39,870 --> 02:57:40,530
Oh, no.

2287
02:57:43,150 --> 02:57:44,310
Oh, no.

2288
02:57:47,090 --> 02:57:49,090
But what would I do after that, though?

2289
02:57:49,250 --> 02:57:49,370
Oh.

2290
02:57:52,510 --> 02:57:54,390
Oh, no, never mind.

2291
02:57:55,750 --> 02:57:56,270
Um...

2292
02:57:56,270 --> 02:57:57,030
Okay.

2293
02:57:58,310 --> 02:57:58,830
Oh, no.

2294
02:58:01,390 --> 02:58:01,910
No!

2295
02:58:03,750 --> 02:58:05,510
Oh, no, she got her full win streak.

2296
02:58:06,170 --> 02:58:08,610
No, not the full win streak.

2297
02:58:12,740 --> 02:58:14,380
You got some butt slams there, though.

2298
02:58:16,060 --> 02:58:17,500
I'm figuring it out.

2299
02:58:17,760 --> 02:58:18,700
I got the butt slam!

2300
02:58:20,400 --> 02:58:38,860

Excuse me.

2304
02:59:01,370 --> 02:59:03,110
What the fuck?

2305
02:59:04,210 --> 02:59:05,670
God, you're such a loser.

2306
02:59:09,850 --> 02:59:11,710
That's fucking right.

2307
02:59:12,150 --> 02:59:13,270
Fuck that up.

2308
02:59:13,930 --> 02:59:15,050
You're such a loser.

2309
02:59:16,570 --> 02:59:17,530
God.

2310
02:59:18,070 --> 02:59:23,770
Oh, whoops.

2311
02:59:25,710 --> 02:59:26,250
What?

2312
02:59:28,390 --> 02:59:29,690
It's like a threat.

2313
02:59:32,290 --> 02:59:32,810
Why not?

2314
02:59:35,330 --> 02:59:36,030
Oh no.

2315
02:59:38,330 --> 02:59:38,830
Oh no.

2316
02:59:39,610 --> 02:59:41,110
Oh my god.

2317
02:59:41,390 --> 02:59:41,430
Oh my god.

2318
02:59:41,650 --> 02:59:41,730
Oh no.

2319
02:59:41,730 --> 02:59:41,770
Oh my god.

2320
02:59:41,770 --> 02:59:41,930
Oh my god he punishes me.

2321
02:59:41,970 --> 02:59:42,810
It's a little too early.

2322
02:59:43,210 --> 02:59:43,430
Yeah.

2323
02:59:44,470 --> 02:59:45,110
Oh.

2324
02:59:45,250 --> 02:59:50,090
I hate you.

2325
02:59:51,810 --> 02:59:52,450
Oh.

2326
02:59:54,050 --> 02:59:54,410
Bro.

2327
02:59:55,030 --> 02:59:57,530
What's up with all you guys with your goddamn win streaks?

2328
02:59:58,910 --> 02:59:59,430
No!

2329
03:00:04,410 --> 03:00:08,190
Oh, hey, good buddy.

2330
03:00:15,960 --> 03:00:16,680
That's right.

2331
03:00:17,440 --> 03:00:18,140
That's right!

2332
03:00:22,470 --> 03:00:22,990
Pow!

2333
03:00:25,930 --> 03:00:27,250
Get out of here!

2334
03:00:29,190 --> 03:00:30,670
What would I do next?

2335
03:00:30,830 --> 03:00:30,890
Who?

2336
03:00:31,070 --> 03:00:31,690
Oh, that.

2337
03:00:31,870 --> 03:00:32,290
Never mind.

2338
03:00:33,770 --> 03:00:34,850
That's actually fine.

2339
03:00:35,290 --> 03:00:38,050
Because you should win this round and then they won't have the bar anymore.

2340
03:00:39,750 --> 03:00:40,830
Theoretically, I should.

2341
03:00:41,910 --> 03:00:42,190
Yeah.

2342
03:00:42,610 --> 03:00:44,110
There's actually no way you lose this.

2343
03:00:44,910 --> 03:00:46,130
No, don't say that.

2344
03:00:47,750 --> 03:00:49,210
Um, no, no.

2345
03:00:49,350 --> 03:00:49,970
Not the jinx.

2346
03:00:50,110 --> 03:00:50,450
No.

2347
03:00:50,970 --> 03:00:51,670
Oh, no.

2348
03:00:54,890 --> 03:00:55,390
Um.

2349
03:00:59,220 --> 03:00:59,720
Yay.

2350
03:01:00,620 --> 03:01:00,800
Yay.

2351
03:01:03,180 --> 03:01:03,680
Oh.

2352
03:01:10,830 --> 03:01:13,010
What would I do next?

2353
03:01:13,410 --> 03:01:13,790
I wonder.

2354
03:01:14,110 --> 03:01:16,490
Oh, oh, he knew what I was gonna do next.

2355
03:01:17,750 --> 03:01:18,950
He didn't have to wonder.

2356
03:01:27,710 --> 03:01:28,130
Yeah!

2357
03:01:30,030 --> 03:01:30,650
Yeah!

2358
03:01:33,550 --> 03:01:34,890
Do that one more time.

2359
03:01:37,050 --> 03:01:38,530
Wait, I got new cheese!

That's fine.

2369
03:03:32,490 --> 03:03:33,490
I have this.

2370
03:03:36,050 --> 03:03:36,250
Oh.

2371
03:03:38,170 --> 03:03:38,970
That's right.

2372
03:03:39,730 --> 03:03:41,610
Get out!

2373
03:03:42,230 --> 03:03:43,330
My lobby!

03:03:47,810 --> 03:03:48,970
Haha!

Oh!

2377
03:03:50,930 --> 03:03:55,830
Oh my gosh, she's doing mix-ups.

2378
03:03:57,230 --> 03:03:58,450
Yeah, kind of.

2379
03:04:00,230 --> 03:04:02,470
Doing baby mix-ups, but it works.

2380
03:04:04,870 --> 03:04:05,910
Oh, no.

2381
03:04:06,610 --> 03:04:06,890
No!

2382
03:04:07,390 --> 03:04:07,830
Yay!

2383
03:04:08,590 --> 03:04:09,110

03:04:12,610 --> 03:04:13,870
What would I do?

2385
03:04:14,050 --> 03:04:14,610
I wonder.

2386
03:04:17,310 --> 03:04:19,410
That's right, she didn't know I was going to do that.

2387
03:04:19,590 --> 03:04:20,110
Is she?

2388
03:04:20,410 --> 03:04:20,730

2437
03:08:45,790 --> 03:08:48,950
Big Brits coming in tomorrow for additional coaching.

2438
03:08:49,670 --> 03:08:51,130
Yeah, he should teach you some good stuff.

2439
03:08:51,590 --> 03:08:51,670
Whoa!

2440
03:08:52,510 --> 03:08:54,290
He might teach me a seventh move.

2441
03:08:54,490 --> 03:08:55,430
No, a sixth move.

2442
03:08:56,790 --> 03:08:58,110
But that might be a bit too much.

2443
03:08:58,190 --> 03:08:58,910
I don't know, actually.

2444
03:08:59,990 --> 03:09:02,130
He could just help you perfect the ones you know.

2445
03:09:02,190 --> 03:09:04,370
Yeah, yeah, he'll perfect my five moves.

2446
03:09:05,510 --> 03:09:06,450
I got the combo.

2447
03:09:06,550 --> 03:09:08,230
If they start blocking, I do this.

2448
03:09:08,930 --> 03:09:09,330
Yeah.

2449
03:09:09,670 --> 03:09:10,450
Oh, my God.

2450
03:09:10,490 --> 03:09:11,790
They're never expected.

2451
03:09:13,050 --> 03:09:14,170
Yeah, I don't think so.

2454
03:09:51,390 --> 03:09:52,730
I'll do my best.

2455

2477
03:13:20,830 --> 03:13:24,970
And yeah, it's going to be a really packed schedule this week, like I said.

2478
03:13:25,410 --> 03:13:26,790
But it's been fun.

2479
03:13:26,850 --> 03:13:28,170
It's been so fun so far.

2480
03:13:28,270 --> 03:13:30,310
But I always thank you guys so much for the support.

2481
03:13:31,230 --> 03:14:04,390
It feels like I think we might tournament i don't know actually i don't know i felt like this move in particular uh might be it i don't know i mean we're doing so well with this move in general i don't know i feel like i don't know if i can lock in on gif in time in terms of like how i'm feeling about honda like after i figured out,

2482
03:14:04,710 --> 03:14:06,010
like, some of the move?

2483
03:14:06,170 --> 03:14:06,870
I lost to a Gif.

2484
03:14:06,990 --> 03:14:07,870
No, I lost to a Gif.

2485
03:14:08,270 --> 03:14:09,250
She was just better.

2486
03:14:09,830 --> 03:14:12,830
Like, yeah.

2487
03:14:13,610 --> 03:14:15,430
The thing is, I don't know.

2488
03:14:15,670 --> 03:14:19,370
It's the thing about Zang Gif is I have to play so slow.

2489
03:14:20,270 --> 03:14:20,970
I feel like.

2490
03:14:21,390 --> 03:14:23,410
I feel like I have to play really slow.

2491
03:14:23,910 --> 03:14:25,490
Which play style is more comfortable?

2492
03:14:25,910 --> 03:14:29,170
I just feel like I have to play more, like, slower than usual.

2493
03:14:29,730 --> 03:14:31,490
That's why I don't, I'm worried.

2494
03:14:34,930 --> 03:15:01,870
yeah he feels a lot slower while when i was on honda i literally i just fucking headbutt my way forward yeah that's the only thing i'm really um worried about now because like pre-nerf i didn't have to play that slow anymore um like not not anymore but i feel like pre-nerf his play style was not as slow as it was for honda um Um,

2495
03:15:02,990 --> 03:15:10,450
so, um, I feel like I have to be much more calculative when I do my grapple and my jumps.

2496
03:15:12,090 --> 03:15:14,450
You never use his nerf moves.

2497
03:15:14,890 --> 03:15:15,370
That's the thing.

2498
03:15:15,470 --> 03:15:18,090
I don't know moves you use gets nerfed.

2499
03:15:18,270 --> 03:15:20,290
But, like, if he feels a lot slower.

2500
03:15:20,690 --> 03:15:22,610
Or maybe my head is way too fast for Gif.

2501
03:15:23,030 --> 03:15:23,270
Yeah.

2502
03:15:27,290 --> 03:15:32,790
Maybe tomorrow we'll try Zane Gif and then I'll be like, I learned harder today.

2503
03:15:33,230 --> 03:15:35,610
Anyway, can I try Zangiv from BigBree?

2504
03:15:37,550 --> 03:15:38,190
Like...

2505
03:15:38,190 --> 03:15:40,510
Giv is just low in general.

2506
03:15:40,810 --> 03:15:43,390
The thing is, the thing I do...

2507
03:15:43,390 --> 03:15:51,210
They do like about Giv is the fact that I miss this jump grapple.

2508
03:15:51,550 --> 03:15:51,870
You know?

2509
03:15:52,350 --> 03:15:55,710
I can punish people so easily if they jump around me.

2510
03:15:56,070 --> 03:15:57,930
Because this one...

2511
03:15:59,210 --> 03:16:00,090
This one.

2512
03:16:00,150 --> 03:16:01,050
That's what I miss.

2513
03:16:02,490 --> 03:16:24,210
I missed that and then obviously like he has very He has good grappler Yeah the jump grab Yeah I don't know I do miss Zangief though To my for my loyal fans I do miss it I will admit This is fun

2514
03:16:27,530 --> 03:16:34,070
This is fun This is fun This is fun I will admit.

2515
03:16:36,250 --> 03:16:38,830
But I was enjoying Honda a lot.

2516
03:16:39,310 --> 03:16:41,110
My loyal dragoons.

2517
03:16:41,490 --> 03:16:43,030
Yeah, the supers, yeah.

2518
03:16:49,030 --> 03:16:51,070
My raw supers, yeah.

2519
03:16:52,590 --> 03:16:54,310
That's what I was known for.

2520
03:16:59,630 --> 03:17:01,150
I say...

2521
03:17:01,490 --> 03:17:02,130
De-Honda.

2522
03:17:02,390 --> 03:17:02,770
That's true.

2523
03:17:03,070 --> 03:17:04,170
My De-Honda's.

2524
03:17:04,370 --> 03:17:05,210
That's true.

2525
03:17:08,930 --> 03:17:14,250
I did, but I did do a lot of, I did lab a lot for De-Honda though.

2526
03:17:14,570 --> 03:17:16,610
God, I'm so conflicted, guys.

2527
03:17:17,150 --> 03:17:19,170
I'm so conflicted, chat.

2528
03:17:21,150 --> 03:17:22,130
I don't know.

2529
03:17:29,090 --> 03:17:29,990
Give it a day?

2530
03:17:30,090 --> 03:17:31,070
I'll give it a day.

2531
03:17:31,630 --> 03:17:38,350
I'll I'll ask Big Bird if he can coach me on Gif a little bit?

2532
03:17:40,370 --> 03:17:40,850
Oh.

2533
03:17:44,560 --> 03:17:45,800
I don't know.

2534
03:17:46,080 --> 03:17:47,800
I'm still so conflicted.

2535
03:17:48,140 --> 03:17:51,160
I felt like I was learning so much on Honda, too.

2536
03:17:52,100 --> 03:17:52,560
Yeah.

2537
03:17:52,740 --> 03:17:54,260
I was learning so much.

2538
03:17:54,560 --> 03:17:56,120
I'm so conflicted, Chad.

2539
03:17:56,180 --> 03:17:57,060
I don't know.

2540
03:17:57,400 --> 03:17:59,000
I'm so conflicted.

2541
03:18:02,700 --> 03:18:03,900
Gif fallback?

2542
03:18:04,240 --> 03:18:05,420
Do I do a Gif fallback?

2543
03:18:07,320 --> 03:18:08,440
Okay, but I could do it.

2544
03:18:09,040 --> 03:18:09,340
Wait.

2545
03:18:11,580 --> 03:18:13,220
Wait, what was the move that I was like?

2546
03:18:13,520 --> 03:18:13,660
Oh, my.

2547
03:18:13,760 --> 03:18:14,500
Oh, yeah, this.

2548
03:18:15,360 --> 03:18:16,760
This move is cool.

2549
03:18:20,920 --> 03:18:23,180
I want to do that in a match, though.

2550
03:18:23,360 --> 03:18:25,360
That's what I want to do.

2551
03:18:30,360 --> 03:18:30,800
That's true.

2552
03:18:30,860 --> 03:18:32,320
They are expecting Zengi.

2553
03:18:32,700 --> 03:18:33,560
How about tomorrow?

2554
03:18:33,840 --> 03:18:35,320
I'll do a little bit of coaching.

2555
03:18:36,600 --> 03:18:37,260
I'll do a little bit of coaching.

2556
03:18:37,280 --> 03:18:40,840
little bit coaching with Big Bird, with Zangief.

2557
03:18:40,980 --> 03:18:44,500
I'll do split coaching with Honda and Zangief.

2558
03:18:45,100 --> 03:18:47,780
And then on day two, I'll figure it out.

2559
03:18:47,860 --> 03:18:48,580
I'll figure it out.

2560
03:18:48,900 --> 03:18:49,900
Which won't be my main.

2561
03:18:50,420 --> 03:18:53,940
Because like I said, I know everyone knows me for my Zangief too.

2562
03:18:54,260 --> 03:18:56,740
Everyone knows me for my Zangief.

2563
03:18:56,960 --> 03:18:59,120
So like I said, it's just... It's so difficult!

2564
03:18:59,880 --> 03:19:00,820
It's so difficult!

2565
03:19:03,180 --> 03:19:03,860
Oh, no.

2566
03:19:03,900 --> 03:19:06,040
I don't think Brawlpo want to coach the competition, guys.

2567
03:19:06,240 --> 03:19:06,680
I...

2568
03:19:08,780 --> 03:19:15,480
Guys, I don't know if you guys know this, but Brawl Pro is also in this tournament, and he is on the enemy team.

2569
03:19:17,080 --> 03:19:18,520
Yeah, the damage is lower.

2570
03:19:18,600 --> 03:19:19,100
That's the only...

2571
03:19:19,100 --> 03:19:20,420
That's another thing I don't like.

2572
03:19:21,820 --> 03:19:23,200
It is very low damage.

2573
03:19:23,400 --> 03:19:24,160
I will admit.

2574
03:19:26,860 --> 03:19:27,480
What is it?

2575
03:19:27,740 --> 03:19:28,700
It's like this, right?

2576
03:19:29,620 --> 03:19:30,340
Where's Iha?

2577
03:19:31,700 --> 03:19:32,140
Iha.

2578
03:19:32,780 --> 03:19:33,220
Iha.

2579
03:19:41,050 --> 03:19:43,090
How do I do the green thing?

2580
03:19:43,270 --> 03:19:43,850
Yeah, I saw that.

2581
03:19:43,930 --> 03:19:45,170
Oh, it's this.

2582
03:19:47,730 --> 03:19:53,490
I was like, how do you do the green thing again?

2583
03:19:55,830 --> 03:19:56,250
What?

2584
03:19:56,350 --> 03:19:57,330
How did I do that?

2585
03:20:02,170 --> 03:20:03,870
How did I do that again?

2586
03:20:05,150 --> 03:20:06,050
What the fuck?

2587
03:20:07,990 --> 03:20:10,330
Wait, don't press tap forward twice.

2588
03:20:14,810 --> 03:20:15,210
What?

2589
03:20:16,270 --> 03:20:17,610
Oh, okay.

2590
03:20:17,770 --> 03:20:19,870
I remember I used to abuse that a lot too.

2591
03:20:20,690 --> 03:20:22,950
And then I did this to fuck with people.

2592
03:20:24,570 --> 03:20:26,890
I remember I would do that.

2593
03:20:28,530 --> 03:20:30,110
And then I'd be like, boom.

2594
03:20:31,730 --> 03:20:33,130
And I don't remember how to grab that.

2595
03:20:34,070 --> 03:20:35,850
And then I'd be like, I do this.

2596
03:20:35,930 --> 03:20:36,770
Yeah, it's so good.

2597
03:20:36,990 --> 03:20:37,730
It's such a good bit.

2598
03:20:37,830 --> 03:20:38,830
And then I'd be like, whoa.

2599
03:20:39,190 --> 03:20:40,710
And then I'd be like, yeehaw.

2600
03:20:41,550 --> 03:20:43,090
But that was old dokey.

2601
03:20:44,170 --> 03:21:16,150

I don't know what it was.

2603
03:21:17,690 --> 03:21:20,270
And so I thought I was just like, headbutt.

2604

Say hi, Jaden.

2612
03:21:37,250 --> 03:21:37,770
Posture check.

2613
03:21:37,850 --> 03:21:38,850
Get up and move around.

2614
03:21:38,950 --> 03:21:39,890
Get that blood flowing.

2615
03:21:40,030 --> 03:21:41,410
An immune cell from me.

2616
03:21:41,670 --> 03:21:43,850
Head to bed because you deserve it.

2617
03:21:44,170 --> 03:21:45,450

2618
03:21:46,050 --> 03:21:46,730
