I can't really say who's in it because it has been announced
yet.

4
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,590
It's like there was a lot of things going on.

Like people were getting rotated and stuff like today.

6
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,070
So like I'm like worried that like I was like, is this
finalized?

7
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,570
Well, we just had a scrim.

8
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:20,010
So so like we practiced we had well, we didn't have full
team scrim.

9
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:26,570
tank player wasn't couldn't make it um so i had to get a
ringer like well i had to get a pro player to ring for us

10
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:36,710
because i was just like i don't know anyone so so like
obviously it's not very much fair but like he was also like

11
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:49,750

teams, um, and I'm nervous.

14

You just, this monitor doesn't actually guarantee you top
500.

So, yeah, results may vary, not guaranteed.

569
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:04,330
I can't do that.

570
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:05,030
That's crazy.

571
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:06,170
They're just scratching you.

572
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:07,370
No, we're just scratching you, man.

573
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:08,630
No, come.

574
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:11,070

575
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:11,850
That was a beat.

576
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:12,550
That was a beat.

577
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:14,490
No!

578
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:15,790

579
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:18,530
The nuke of got nuked.

580
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:22,870
I see the strap we're trying to go with.

581
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:25,370
Every time we lose, we get a sub.

582
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:27,130
That's how it is, mate.

583
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:28,150
We'll be millionaires.

584
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:29,030
Until we get shrouded.

585
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,390
Shit, we have millionaires.

586
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:31,670
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

587
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:33,270
Okay, but nuke of was pretty dumb.

588
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:35,270
He said, okay, but he did ditch us a lot.

589
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:36,110
So I don't know.

590
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:36,850
I don't know.

591
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:38,210
That is true.

592
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:38,890
It's like a lion.

593
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:39,630
I don't like his name.

594
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:41,570
Which part?

595
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:42,390
It's hard to say.

596
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:43,750
I don't want to say the wrong word.

597
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:44,290
Which part?

598
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:46,390
Which part of the name that you're not like?

599
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:49,350
Can you say it out loud for us so I know what to do?

600
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:49,510
I'm a peacemaker.

601
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:50,210
I don't like...

602
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:51,450
You guys are too paranoid.

603
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:53,170
You know, you guys are too...

604
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:57,070
This is why being blind to a lot of things in life is just
better, you know?

605
00:41:57,690 --> 00:41:58,710
You know what I'm saying?

606
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:00,750
Sometimes you might get in trouble.

607
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:04,970
So there's a Korean proverb called, Don't put your head
under the pear tree.

608
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:07,630
You know, don't put yourself in that position, right?

609
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:08,290
Yeah.

610
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:09,950
You put your head in what?

611
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:11,490
Why do ostriches do it?

612
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:14,270
It's like, so don't stick dick in crazy type thing.

613
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:15,210
Ostriches aren't humans.

614
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:17,130
Yeah, why do ostriches do it?

615
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:19,870
If you want to be an ostrich, do you want to...

616
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:20,390
Yeah.

617
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:23,890
Aren't you a bird?

618
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:25,270
Ostriches can't fly!

619
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:27,430
So, they can run...

620
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:28,190
Oh, those fuckers.

621
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:30,110
What's an ostrich again?

622
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:31,530
Those guys are big eggs.

623
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:32,810
The big egg guys.

624
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:42,490
a big emu ox axel a big but they run so fast though they're
very fast runners yeah they're like emus they're like emus

625
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:49,050
we have emus they're like they're like emus but like i don't
know which ones i think i think ostriches are faster than

626
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:57,070
emus i'm pretty sure they're like emus without horns they
both taste like they both taste like have you have you ate

627
00:42:57,070 --> 00:43:06,750
an emu ostriches have the the top part isn't don't emus have
the little top horn thingies they have horns i don't

628
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:14,250

631
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:32,730
the australians win how Wait, but like, how would you lose
the war?

632
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:34,910
They literally threw criminals on the island.

633
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:36,110
Not the Emi one.

634
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:38,650
Like, don't you guys go hard?

635
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:42,150
Like, why else did they banish you from the United Kingdom?

636
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:44,670
Banish who?

637
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:46,910
That's how Australians were born.

638
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:51,250
They took all the criminals from the United Kingdom and then
shipped them to Australia.

639
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:52,550
Oh, yeah, yeah.

640
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:53,170
That's what I'm saying.

641
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:54,310
So, like...

642
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:56,470
Yeah, so how did you guys lose the war?

643
00:43:58,650 --> 00:43:59,610
What do you mean?

644
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:00,790
How did you lose the war?

645
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:02,750
The wards against animals.

646
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:05,090
It's all against animals.

I thought you guys were talking about the people losing to
the British people.

649
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:17,470
No, I'm talking about the evil war.

00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:22,940
You're so far.

868
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:23,440
You're so far.

869
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:24,360
Sayonara.

870
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:30,020

871
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:31,080
recoil.

872
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:32,520
I hit 140.

873
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,120
This recoil fucking sucks.

874
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:38,900
I might die.

875
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:39,340
Is he inside?

876
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,140
Yeah, he's sniping.

877
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:43,580
Oh, there's a tank!

878
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:47,180
That tank is sniping!

879
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:50,400
Oh, shit.

880
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:51,060
I need armor.

881
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:52,260
I have armor.

882
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:53,000
I have armor.

883
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:53,860
I'll drop your armor.

884
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:54,680
I'll drop your armor.

885
00:55:56,060 --> 00:56:02,620
Okay, so I got fucking tanked by 20 miles away.

886
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:04,800
I don't go worse.

887
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:06,140
I don't understand.

888
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:08,080

890
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:10,020
I'm gonna try to hit the fence.

891
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:13,040
When we get a tank, we get instantly destroyed.

892
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,340
When they have a tank, they live.

893
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,480
That's not fair.

894
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:19,760
Eco rights.

895
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:21,240
It's because I'm a woman.

896
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:22,240
How do you attach a thermite?

897
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:23,700
Do you need to be holding a thermite?

898
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:24,580
Oh, there's someone there.

899
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:27,500
There's someone there.

900
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:28,580
There's someone at the redeploy.

901
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:29,540

906
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:40,690

907
00:56:40,910 --> 00:56:41,450

908
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:43,710

Like to your right.

911
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:48,510
Just don't get near the tank.

912
00:56:49,690 --> 00:56:49,930
Oh.

913
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:50,850

If Mr. Twitch, if you still hear, how the hell did he get on

Are you not on the front page?

00:59:43,810 --> 00:59:44,810

957
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:46,630
Wait, but how did he get...

958
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:50,130
Wait, you must be on the front page because they gifted you
a hundred subs.

959
00:59:51,430 --> 00:59:52,650
Is that how it works?

960
00:59:52,770 --> 00:59:53,050

00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:55,430

01:01:01,590 --> 01:01:01,730

991
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:04,790
Oh, I got killed by Kanoli.

992
01:01:05,290 --> 01:01:07,310
I don't know anybody who goes like...

993
01:01:07,310 --> 01:01:09,630
Oh, look at my dog tag!

994
01:01:10,130 --> 01:01:11,070
No, the guy...

995
01:01:11,070 --> 01:01:12,450
No, I'm not talking about Ninja.

996
01:01:12,730 --> 01:01:13,110

997
01:01:13,110 --> 01:01:13,710

998
01:01:13,890 --> 01:01:15,370
Yeah, Nick.

999
01:01:15,490 --> 01:01:17,550
The guy that's like...

1000
01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:18,790
God, what was this Fortnite scene?

1001
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:19,630
Nick Fuentes?

1002
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:21,830
Nick Fu...

1003
01:01:21,830 --> 01:01:25,190
Nick Fuentes?

1004
01:01:25,450 --> 01:01:29,750
What was this famous thing that he says to this child?

1005
01:01:29,970 --> 01:01:30,630
I don't remember.

1006
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:32,830
His child, he's got a child.

1007
01:01:33,050 --> 01:01:34,710
Never back down, never what?

1008
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:37,350
Yeah, never back down, never what?

1009
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:41,950
How did that guy just...

1010
01:01:41,950 --> 01:01:43,790
Oh, one more, one more going your way.

1011
01:01:43,870 --> 01:01:44,670
I'm coming back.

1012
01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:47,350
On me, on me, on me.

1013
01:01:47,350 --> 01:01:53,450
Yeah, but that guy never swears at all because his entire
channel is dead for the children.

1014
01:01:55,450 --> 01:01:57,810
I'm going to try to find one singular gun.

1015
01:01:58,230 --> 01:02:00,330
How did I broke my ankle again?

1016
01:02:01,590 --> 01:02:02,450
Oh, there's people on me.

1017
01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:03,290
There's people on me.

1018
01:02:04,390 --> 01:02:05,310
Axel, can you raise me?

1019
01:02:06,070 --> 01:02:06,490
Oh, shit.

1020
01:02:09,310 --> 01:02:09,990
There was a person.

1021
01:02:10,110 --> 01:02:12,890
I know in the heat of combat, you tend to forget about me,
but it hurts sometimes.

1022
01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:14,730
No, I just don't.

1023
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:16,230
That's deep in my...

1024
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:16,970
I'm camping.

1025
01:02:18,130 --> 01:02:21,390
Bro, my aim is all over the place.

1026
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:22,190
God damn it.

1027
01:02:22,290 --> 01:02:25,030
It's like me on a drunk night trying to take a piss, man.

1028
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:25,710
Fuck.

1029
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:27,750
Like, whoa.

1030
01:02:27,890 --> 01:02:29,230
There is a team here.

1031
01:02:29,610 --> 01:02:30,450
So I'm...

1032
01:02:31,610 --> 01:02:33,310
I'm a little...

1033
01:02:33,310 --> 01:02:34,030
Oh, shit!

1034
01:02:34,730 --> 01:02:36,330
Is him again?

1035
01:02:37,030 --> 01:02:38,670
I thought you guys killed him!

1036
01:02:38,870 --> 01:02:40,110
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1037
01:02:40,110 --> 01:02:41,450
No, dog tag for you!

1038
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:44,890
No, don't use that again!

1039
01:02:45,530 --> 01:02:48,170
I'm not giving him my dog tag.

1040
01:02:51,290 --> 01:02:53,230
Bro, fuck the canoli guy.

1041
01:02:53,310 --> 01:02:54,310
That guy is crazy.

1042
01:02:57,110 --> 01:02:58,070
Nice colossal.

1043
01:02:58,070 --> 01:02:58,770
Yes, sir.

1044
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:00,350
Yeah, there's him.

1045
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:06,130
Okay, our child is dead.

1046
01:03:09,130 --> 01:03:10,810
I have 11 bullets.

1047
01:03:11,090 --> 01:03:12,790
I don't know what I can do with 11 bullets.

1048
01:03:13,090 --> 01:03:13,630
Just hit it all.

1049
01:03:13,850 --> 01:03:15,570
You don't have, you have 180.

1050
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:16,610
What do you mean?

1051
01:03:17,330 --> 01:03:17,810
100.

1052
01:03:18,150 --> 01:03:19,830
You must be blind, lady.

1053
01:03:20,170 --> 01:03:20,170
Shit.

1054
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:22,950
Bro, you have 11 in a mag.

1055
01:03:23,850 --> 01:03:24,630
What do you mean?

1056
01:03:25,990 --> 01:03:28,610
Is that the gun that I'm trying to use though?

1057
01:03:30,470 --> 01:03:31,430
Hell no!

1058
01:03:31,990 --> 01:03:34,430
What the fuck is 11 out of 180?

1059

1109
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:46,760

01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:50,020
Okay, he didn't want me to grab his dog tags.

01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:02,240
You did pick him up?

1120
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:04,560
That guy is not a chopper.

1121
01:06:04,780 --> 01:06:05,440
Look at him.

1122
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:07,240

1124
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:11,240

I literally just saw some dude looking like Jesus falling
from the sky.

He deletes his Steam account and he makes section 1019,
section 1021.

1331
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:18,180
i'll agree and we have a car we can move in with the car
guys we could also blow it up that'd be pretty cool we can

1332
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:25,740
okay how about this we drive a car into someone and blow it

want me to let's go to defense nexus and just sit in the

1334
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:42,720
house and wait this is our best bet also there's people
fighting defenses nexus right now so i don't know now but we

1335
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:49,460
got a car but the thing is is that if this car blows up

Kind of sucks after constantly carry this when I'm like.

1339
01:21:07,910 --> 01:21:08,390
LNG kit.

1340
01:21:09,810 --> 01:21:11,210
We just stay here and wait.

1341
01:21:13,230 --> 01:21:14,830
Let's find a good defensible position.

1342
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:22,280
Wait, there is another shotgun.

1343
01:21:24,460 --> 01:21:24,960
Hey, guys.

1344
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:26,260

01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:26,960
Where do we wait?

1346
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:28,340
I'm away here.

1347
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:30,460
Actually, no.

1348
01:21:30,540 --> 01:21:32,220
We should wait in a room where there's no...

1349
01:21:32,860 --> 01:21:34,020
entrances and exits.

1350
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:35,640
Or, I mean, there's one exit.

1351
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:39,600
Yeah, I was like, wait a minute.

1352
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:41,060
That makes no sense.

1353
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:43,920
I'm going to find a room and I'm going to live there.

1354

I'm trying to head over to the next closest redeploy.

1413
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:17,220
Oh, this is a little...

1414
01:24:17,620 --> 01:24:20,480
Oh, I'm getting artillery strike right here, but it's okay.

1415
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:24,240
Why is this game so hard?

1416
01:24:25,340 --> 01:24:26,560
You think they're right below me?

1417
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:28,420
I missed the days of...

1418
01:24:28,420 --> 01:24:30,460
Guys, guys, do you think they're right below me?

1419
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:33,920
No idea, but you got this.

1420
01:24:34,380 --> 01:24:35,740
You think I got it?

1421
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:37,100
Uh-huh.

1422
01:24:37,580 --> 01:24:37,980
You know what?

1423
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:38,840
I'm going to be a little evil.

1424
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,800
No, I don't believe you got this.

1425
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:41,280
You're right.

1426
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:43,700
Sometimes you need a doubter, you know?

1427
01:24:43,860 --> 01:24:44,420
You're right.

1428
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:45,320
You're so right.

1429
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,380
Wait, no, no, Ducky, no.

1430
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:50,060
You're so right.

1431
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:51,440
Why do I even try?

1432
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:52,120
No!

1433
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:53,400
You're so right.

1434
01:24:53,820 --> 01:24:54,860
No, yes.

1435
01:24:58,100 --> 01:25:00,140
Just give up right now.

1436
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:01,840
No, yes.

1437
01:25:02,420 --> 01:25:05,240
Altair is gonna be my 13th reason.

1438
01:25:06,740 --> 01:25:07,220
What?

1439
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:08,720
What's the 12th reason?

1440
01:25:09,260 --> 01:25:10,740
What's the 12 honor reason?

1441
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:12,680
Watch this.

1442
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:15,280
Axel was the previous 12 reasons.

1443
01:25:16,420 --> 01:25:17,740
Axel got the 12.

1444
01:25:18,860 --> 01:25:20,400
Altair was the breaking point.

1445
01:25:21,060 --> 01:25:22,360
He's already hit me with 10 already.

1446
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:24,200
Just need three more, Doki.

1447
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:28,620
Hey, if you can withstand 10, you can withstand 100.

1448
01:25:28,860 --> 01:25:29,580
You know what I'm saying?

1449
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:31,020
Just think about it like that.

1450
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:40,480

01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:06,420
We are not gonna loot your dead body.

1455
01:26:06,980 --> 01:26:07,700
Yes, I am.

1456
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:09,920
You are not gonna loot your dead body.

1457
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:11,980
I learned so hard.

1458
01:26:12,660 --> 01:26:13,540
There's a...

1459
01:26:13,540 --> 01:26:14,600
There's something you need.

1460
01:26:15,220 --> 01:26:15,820
It's a bad idea.

1461
01:26:16,420 --> 01:26:18,020
You know what I'm gonna do?

01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:20,980

Oh no, from the back.

Oh my god, there's a sniper right there.

1593
01:33:18,220 --> 01:33:19,560
There's a sniper right on me.

1594
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:21,400
Don't don't don't don't pick up the hill.

1595
01:33:21,640 --> 01:33:22,440
This hill has a sniper.

1596
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:25,280
This hill has a sniper in front of me.

1597
01:33:25,820 --> 01:33:25,820
Yeah.

1598
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:29,880
Oh no, this is bad.

1599
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:37,840
This is bad because that team is literally looking at us and
there's last two teams and they have...

1600
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:38,600
Oh, um...

I'll tear.

1604
01:33:41,180 --> 01:33:43,700
The only thing I could do is maybe I can airstrike this.

1605
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:46,580
This is a huge poor economy right now.

1606
01:33:46,660 --> 01:33:47,100
We shall.

1607
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:47,960
And I'm there.

1608
01:33:48,780 --> 01:33:49,440
It's fine.

1609
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:50,320
My airstrike went off.

1610
01:33:50,380 --> 01:33:51,960
My airstrike went off, but I died for us.

1611
01:33:52,620 --> 01:33:55,120
I don't know if you can rest me, but my airstrike went off.

1612
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:58,440
Oh, I can try.

1613
01:33:58,760 --> 01:33:59,100
I'll tell you.

1614
01:33:59,200 --> 01:33:59,500
I don't know.

1615
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:01,200
I don't know if this is a good idea.

1616
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:02,280
I got killed.

1617
01:34:02,360 --> 01:34:02,960

1618
01:34:03,320 --> 01:34:04,100
I gotta kill.

1619
01:34:04,540 --> 01:34:05,880
My airstrike did it.

1620
01:34:06,020 --> 01:34:07,780
I- I- Okay, this is it.

1621
01:34:08,260 --> 01:34:08,960
This is it.

1622
01:34:09,100 --> 01:34:10,620
Oh, this is it.

1623
01:34:10,620 --> 01:34:11,240
This is it.

1624
01:34:11,240 --> 01:34:11,320
This is it.

1625
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:11,920
I gotta kill.

1626
01:34:12,340 --> 01:34:13,080
I gotta kill.

1627
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:14,680
Let's keep laughing.

1628
01:34:14,860 --> 01:34:15,500
Let's keep smiling.

1629
01:34:16,100 --> 01:34:16,320

1632
01:34:18,260 --> 01:34:19,540

They're fighting.

1639
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:23,260
They're fighting.

1640
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:23,960

1641
01:34:24,240 --> 01:34:24,440

Okay, let's go.

1644
01:34:30,060 --> 01:34:30,560

01:37:05,180 --> 01:37:05,560
Alright.

1684
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:07,680
My YouTube channel.

1685
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:16,040
So for those who don't know, if you've done the AIM Labs
challenge with MSI and you...

1686
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:17,160
Yes, continue.

1687
01:37:17,660 --> 01:37:19,460
And you have a screenshot ready.

1688
01:37:19,540 --> 01:37:23,480
If you get picked, please have a screenshot ready for...

1689
01:37:23,740 --> 01:37:26,200
For the MSI, monitor, raffle.

1690
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:35,640
The monitor is only restricted to NNA citizens.

1691
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:43,520
So if you do win the raffle, MSI will look into getting you
another monitor that, or I don't know, get used to something

1692
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:46,200
else that they can ship you in your country.

1693
01:37:46,580 --> 01:37:50,160
Or get a Steam wallet code of equivalent value.

1694
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:50,780
So I don't know.

1695
01:37:50,820 --> 01:37:53,040
I think the wallet monitor is like $1,000 plus.

1696
01:37:53,740 --> 01:38:00,440
So you win this monitor, but you don't live in NA, you get
$1,000 worth of steam money, basically.

1697
01:38:00,940 --> 01:38:01,960
So if you guys win the raffle.

1698
01:38:02,240 --> 01:38:04,440
But you have to make sure you do the AIM Labs.

1699
01:38:04,780 --> 01:38:06,120

One more hoe.

1891
01:51:03,580 --> 01:51:04,760
So unappreciative.

1892
01:51:05,180 --> 01:51:05,760
Sometimes I can do it.

1893
01:51:05,940 --> 01:51:07,060
Sometimes I can't.

1894
01:51:08,280 --> 01:51:09,760
I learned how to whack the sack.

1895
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:13,060
Whacking the sack.

1896
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:13,620

2152
02:04:38,940 --> 02:04:39,480
What?

2153
02:04:40,120 --> 02:04:41,760
That's an ad worthy death.

2154
02:04:42,260 --> 02:04:43,100
There's no way.

2155
02:04:43,320 --> 02:04:45,200
There is no way.

2156
02:04:47,490 --> 02:04:49,030
And they owned this guy's walling.

2157
02:04:49,150 --> 02:04:49,870
I refused.

2158
02:04:50,150 --> 02:04:51,670
This guy had to be walling.

2159
02:04:52,030 --> 02:04:53,690
Like, there's no way.

2160
02:04:54,270 --> 02:04:54,890
There's no fucking way.

2161
02:04:54,890 --> 02:04:56,910
Or you just got stream sniper.

2162
02:04:58,430 --> 02:04:59,750
There's no way.

2163
02:04:59,910 --> 02:05:00,350
Don't see.

2164
02:05:00,390 --> 02:05:01,250
He knows exactly.

2165
02:05:01,470 --> 02:05:03,810
He went in there and shot the building and then left.

2166
02:05:04,390 --> 02:05:06,470
Like, there's no fucking way.

2167
02:05:06,730 --> 02:05:08,010
There's no way.

2168
02:05:10,170 --> 02:05:10,710
Crazy.

2169
02:05:11,110 --> 02:05:13,070
How did he know?

2170
02:05:15,150 --> 02:05:18,470
That's just life, sometimes maybe good, sometimes maybe
sheep.

2171
02:05:18,990 --> 02:05:20,230
Oh, they have recon?

2172
02:05:21,010 --> 02:05:22,510
What the fuck is recon?

2173
02:05:23,590 --> 02:05:24,970
I know every...

2174
02:05:24,970 --> 02:05:26,890
There's recon in this game!

2175
02:05:27,830 --> 02:05:31,110
I think I just unlocked my drone.

2176
02:05:32,950 --> 02:05:35,470
Wait, how the fuck you unlock shit in this game?

2177

2179
02:05:38,090 --> 02:05:39,810
There's a monitor sensor.

2180
02:05:41,590 --> 02:05:44,650
Oh my god, there's a recon class.

2181
02:05:46,470 --> 02:05:47,830
There's a recon class?

2182
02:05:50,330 --> 02:05:51,570
That's a sniper class, right?

2183
02:05:51,930 --> 02:05:52,690
Is that the sniper?

2184
02:05:53,570 --> 02:05:54,290
I think so.

2185
02:05:54,590 --> 02:05:56,070
Oh, they have motion sensing.

2186
02:05:56,270 --> 02:05:58,250

Two seconds.

2882
02:45:57,540 --> 02:46:01,140
How does it feel, Winfield, to have your life just
precariously hanging up by a string?

2883
02:46:01,380 --> 02:46:01,840
Exactly.

I.

2890
02:46:45,860 --> 02:46:49,000
When it was Altair and I, we got second place without
Winfield.

2891
02:46:50,580 --> 02:46:51,780
Toki, you wouldn't do this to Winfield.

He's been so great to us.

2893
02:46:54,420 --> 02:46:57,660

02:53:57,580 --> 02:53:58,100
That's crazy.

3011
02:53:59,160 --> 02:53:59,500
Winfield.

3012
02:53:59,680 --> 02:54:00,720
Unlucky, unlucky, unlucky.

3013
02:54:00,800 --> 02:54:01,480
It has been.

3014
02:54:02,720 --> 02:54:04,450
It has been a pleasure, but...

3015
02:54:05,080 --> 02:54:07,040
This game is bullshit, man.

3016
02:54:08,120 --> 02:54:09,620
Rank 22nd place.

3017
02:54:10,700 --> 02:54:11,340
It's time.

3018
02:54:12,140 --> 02:54:13,060
We gotta...

3019
02:54:13,060 --> 02:54:13,800
It's time.

3020
02:54:13,860 --> 02:54:15,380
We have to rehire a new...

3021
02:54:15,380 --> 02:54:16,240
A new Winfield.

3022
02:54:17,900 --> 02:54:18,840
Who are we hiring?

3023
02:54:19,220 --> 02:54:19,440
Nice.

3024
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:22,380
Yeah, it's been a pleasure.

3025
02:54:22,400 --> 02:54:25,140
We'll adopt someone in the wild, I believe.

3026
02:54:26,020 --> 02:54:26,780
Winfield, it's been a pleasure.

3027
02:54:27,100 --> 02:54:28,460
It has been a pleasure, Winfield.

3028
02:54:29,080 --> 02:54:29,580
But you're out.

3029
02:54:30,860 --> 02:54:32,160
You're out, buddy.

3030
02:54:32,960 --> 02:54:35,360
I'll forever remember you as the person who was super drunk.

3031
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:37,960
Super drunk.

3032
02:54:39,700 --> 02:54:43,340
Maybe we'll get a gamer after Winfield.

3033
02:54:43,660 --> 02:54:45,600
You know, maybe we'll get Winfield 2.0.

3034
02:54:46,840 --> 02:54:47,320
Winnerfield.

3035
02:54:48,140 --> 02:54:48,780
I believe.

3036
02:54:50,940 --> 02:54:54,260
Winfield, if you get in our game, Kill everyone else for us.

3037
02:54:55,760 --> 02:54:58,420
You're like one of those backpack people who just like dies
in front of us.

3038
02:54:58,800 --> 02:54:59,200
Winfield.

3039
02:55:00,640 --> 02:55:03,220
If you're Q-Sniper us right now.

3040
02:55:05,360 --> 02:55:06,580
Q-Sniper us.

3041
02:55:06,980 --> 02:55:08,560
And then land where we land.

3042
02:55:08,680 --> 02:55:10,980
And then we'll adopt you as our fifth player.

3043
02:55:14,480 --> 02:55:15,920
I'll let you join Tempest.

3044
02:55:16,940 --> 02:55:17,200
Yeah.

3045
02:55:17,540 --> 02:55:18,620
We'll adopt you.

3046
02:55:18,680 --> 02:55:19,660
Just land on us.

3047
02:55:22,800 --> 02:55:23,240
Winfield.

3048
02:55:23,540 --> 02:55:24,900
Wait, Winfield, why are you here?

3049
02:55:26,720 --> 02:55:27,100
Yes.

3050
02:55:27,660 --> 02:55:28,500
Winfield, we fired you.

3051
02:55:28,620 --> 02:55:29,500
How are you still here?

3052
02:55:30,480 --> 02:55:31,980
You didn't even kick.

3053
02:55:32,120 --> 02:55:33,780
Because we're expecting you to leave.

3054
02:55:34,300 --> 02:55:37,300
If we kick you, it means we have to give you severance pay.

3055
02:55:37,400 --> 02:55:38,900
We need you to quit on your own.

3056
02:55:42,380 --> 02:55:43,580
That's how it works.

3057
02:55:44,140 --> 02:55:46,600
If you quit, we don't have to pay severance.

3058
02:55:55,720 --> 02:55:57,300
You're abused to leave.

02:58:06,260 --> 02:58:06,980
I'm so safe.

I'll tell you.

3086
02:58:08,020 --> 02:58:08,600
I'm so safe.

3087
02:58:08,620 --> 02:58:09,740
The railings are too safe.

3088
02:58:09,920 --> 02:58:11,360
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

3089
02:58:11,540 --> 02:58:13,820

You live.

3094
02:58:18,060 --> 02:58:18,720
Who's alive?

3095
02:58:18,740 --> 02:58:19,360
Because I'm a gamer.

3096
02:58:19,760 --> 02:58:21,280
You can't rely on people being gamers.

3097
02:58:21,800 --> 02:58:23,580
Nope, because it was so safe.

3098
02:58:26,020 --> 02:58:26,820
I was safe.

3099
02:58:28,800 --> 02:58:29,240
Oh.

3100
02:58:29,520 --> 02:58:29,980

3101
02:58:30,500 --> 02:58:31,140
Where was this?

3102
02:58:31,160 --> 02:58:32,060
This guy's gun.

3103
02:58:33,400 --> 02:58:33,980
I don't know.

3104
02:58:37,480 --> 02:58:38,220
Wait, wait, wait.

Oh, okay, okay, okay.

3108
02:58:41,260 --> 02:58:42,360
I don't have nades.

3109
02:58:42,500 --> 02:58:43,900
This game is fucking bullshit.

3110
02:58:44,140 --> 02:58:44,900
Why do we spawn?

3111
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:46,120
It doesn't give me nades.

3112
02:58:47,040 --> 02:58:48,620
Bro, welcome to the real world.

3113
02:58:49,820 --> 02:58:50,640
I killed one.

3114
02:58:50,960 --> 02:58:52,280
Jesus fucking Christ.

3115
02:58:53,240 --> 02:58:53,560
Oh, my God.

3116
02:58:53,680 --> 02:58:55,440
He also respawned, too.

3117
02:58:57,320 --> 02:58:57,660
Nice.

3118
02:58:58,080 --> 02:58:59,540
Guys, I'm gonna chase him, too.

3119
02:59:01,380 --> 02:59:03,740
Oh, on me, on me, on me, on me, on me!

Oh, 20, 20!

3123
02:59:10,580 --> 02:59:12,160
Oh, we don't even know how much I hit him for it.

I'm so safe, guys.

3128
02:59:22,660 --> 02:59:23,060
Nice!

3129
02:59:23,780 --> 02:59:26,260
See, I told you guys, I knew I was safe.

3130
02:59:27,800 --> 02:59:29,860
Bro, this pistol is so shit.

Okay, let's go.

3400
03:10:50,620 --> 03:10:54,320
People running across east, across the road.

Don't worry.

3497
03:19:06,600 --> 03:19:07,020

3498
03:19:07,260 --> 03:19:07,620

3499
03:19:08,840 --> 03:19:10,080
I'm getting pinged.

3500
03:19:10,580 --> 03:19:16,960
It took so long to get the fucking command for taking the
dog tag, man.

3501
03:19:17,480 --> 03:19:21,380
So, oh, Winfield's like, I'm trying to kill them, but I was
1v3, so I'm sorry.

3502
03:19:21,480 --> 03:19:22,440
Yeah, you should be sorry.

3503
03:19:22,600 --> 03:19:24,200
You should have 1v4, Ado.

3504
03:19:26,620 --> 03:19:28,360
In fact, I'll switch teams, 1v5.

3505
03:19:28,940 --> 03:19:30,080
Yeah, exactly, Winfield.

3506
03:19:30,720 --> 03:19:31,280
God damn.

3507
03:19:32,700 --> 03:19:33,460
Oh, I can't order pizza.

3508
03:19:33,940 --> 03:19:35,120
No, I can eat a pot.

3509
03:19:37,640 --> 03:19:38,820
It's my safe tunnel.

3510
03:19:39,780 --> 03:19:40,680
I'm a little worm.

3511
03:19:41,600 --> 03:19:43,400
I'm a little caterpillar in my chrysalis.

3512
03:19:44,080 --> 03:19:47,000
Yeah, I'm going to boil you in the pot.

3513
03:19:47,160 --> 03:19:50,000
I'm going to boil you in the pot.

3514
03:19:50,840 --> 03:19:51,420

3515
03:19:52,980 --> 03:19:54,020
Oh, okay.

3516
03:19:54,380 --> 03:19:56,560

Sorry, I died.

3518
03:19:58,800 --> 03:20:00,040
Did you use that one?

3519
03:20:01,840 --> 03:20:02,600
A real ploy.

3520
03:20:02,700 --> 03:20:11,520
is uh i don't remember all right then i guess i'll go to the
next read-up plan hope that one is safe

03:20:14,800 --> 03:20:25,800
all right that's a chopper i said went to the fucking where
the fuck is the read-up oh wait that was the read-up plan

went to the goddamn melek oh wait no it's over here i was
like where the fuck is it hey the chopper strat is a method

3523
03:20:34,340 --> 03:20:42,960

Alone with my pistol.

It's like you guys never died.

3529
03:21:17,380 --> 03:21:18,060
Heroes never died.

3530
03:21:18,340 --> 03:21:19,460
Oh my god, I keep getting shotguns.

3531
03:21:19,500 --> 03:21:20,760
All I get is shotguns.

3532
03:21:21,180 --> 03:21:23,680
Like there's no other gun in existence in this game.

3533
03:21:25,320 --> 03:21:27,140
It's just, oops, all shotguns.

3534
03:21:30,760 --> 03:21:31,140
Okay, yep.

When we get that win, it's going to feel so good, though.

3538
03:22:03,200 --> 03:22:03,420
You know?

3539
03:22:03,800 --> 03:22:04,320

Also, there's a team right here.

3542
03:22:09,940 --> 03:22:10,100

03:28:36,970 --> 03:28:38,150
Okay, we got to try to get over here.

3663
03:28:39,070 --> 03:28:39,110
Yeah.

3664
03:28:39,250 --> 03:28:39,710
We'll try.

3665
03:28:40,310 --> 03:28:42,410
There is a car right in front of us.

3666
03:28:43,710 --> 03:28:44,870
Like a car to...

3667
03:28:45,550 --> 03:28:46,430
Wait, I don't get out of here.

3668
03:28:47,410 --> 03:28:48,910
I think we might need to take the elevator.

3669
03:28:49,210 --> 03:28:49,510
Where's stairs?

3670
03:28:49,990 --> 03:28:50,830
Oh, here you go.

3671
03:28:51,010 --> 03:28:52,230
Take my ammo, you whore.

3672
03:28:52,670 --> 03:28:53,670
Come on, take it.

3673
03:28:54,650 --> 03:28:55,410
Take the ammo.

3674
03:28:56,070 --> 03:28:56,830
Because they want ammo.

3675
03:28:57,150 --> 03:28:57,450
Take it.

3676
03:28:58,810 --> 03:29:00,290
It's right in front of you.

3677
03:29:02,410 --> 03:29:03,050
That's right.

3678
03:29:04,710 --> 03:29:05,290
That's right.

3679
03:29:05,390 --> 03:29:07,370
Yeah, you know your place.

3680
03:29:09,130 --> 03:29:10,230
Spit on him.

3681
03:29:12,930 --> 03:29:14,790
Are you still above us?

3682
03:29:16,330 --> 03:29:17,630
I think we're good.

3683
03:29:17,950 --> 03:29:18,930
Okay, then we gotta go.

3684
03:29:19,090 --> 03:29:20,170
Well, there's a car in front of us.

3685
03:29:20,290 --> 03:29:21,270
Do we risk it?

3686
03:29:23,270 --> 03:29:24,790
Do we need it?

3687
03:29:26,950 --> 03:29:27,810
There is a chop.

3688
03:29:28,550 --> 03:29:28,810
Alright.

3689
03:29:29,410 --> 03:29:29,810
You know what?

3690
03:29:29,830 --> 03:29:30,670
I'll take the car.

3691
03:29:31,030 --> 03:29:31,270
Gunshots.

3692
03:29:31,970 --> 03:29:32,490
Oh, yeah.

3693
03:29:34,130 --> 03:29:35,350
Are we going for the gunshot?

3694
03:29:35,530 --> 03:29:36,090
Should we go to zone?

3695
03:29:37,570 --> 03:29:37,910
There's a car.

3696
03:29:38,050 --> 03:29:38,270
There's a car.

3697
03:29:38,470 --> 03:29:39,290
Yeah, I'm getting the car.

3698
03:29:40,070 --> 03:29:41,430
I thought you don't trust the car.

3699
03:29:42,070 --> 03:29:43,950
There's a car right in front of us that's driving around.

3700
03:29:45,190 --> 03:29:46,730
Well, I'm gonna go into zone.

Oh, shit, we trapped.

03:31:00,370 --> 03:31:01,750
You just got to sit there and get I.

3729
03:31:02,190 --> 03:31:03,770
No, but he's not going to 1v4.

3730
03:31:03,870 --> 03:31:04,810
There's no way.

3731
03:31:05,450 --> 03:31:06,370
Of course I'm gonna 1v4.

3732
03:31:06,490 --> 03:31:06,570

3737
03:31:15,430 --> 03:31:16,070
That was Prime Shroud.

3738
03:31:16,070 --> 03:31:18,090
Yeah, he's just an old man now, you know.

3739
03:31:18,450 --> 03:31:25,770
Shroud signed my Steam profile, so I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm-
I'm just channeling the energy that I saved since 2017.

3740
03:31:29,070 --> 03:31:30,230

Yeah.

3749
03:31:44,050 --> 03:31:46,770

Five, man.

3751

3836
03:36:43,800 --> 03:36:44,380
Watch out.

3837
03:36:44,700 --> 03:36:46,120
Yeah, he'll give you more money.

3838
03:36:46,580 --> 03:36:47,920
You think you're gonna handle more money?

3839
03:36:48,200 --> 03:36:51,720
Bro, he's gonna make him disappear, bro.

3840
03:36:52,420 --> 03:36:57,060
So I'm gonna show him the strat to win the pokies, and I'm
gonna get him into it too, you know?

3841
03:36:58,300 --> 03:37:01,000
Bro, he's gonna make you gamble it at his casino.

3842
03:37:02,100 --> 03:37:04,060
So he gets back his own money.

3843
03:37:04,620 --> 03:37:06,780
All right, so money laundering, right?

3844
03:37:06,800 --> 03:37:13,120
So he gives me the money, but in order for him to get the
money legally, I go to his casino.

3845
03:37:14,340 --> 03:37:16,680
No, he builds a casino just for you.

3846
03:37:16,900 --> 03:37:18,840
So like, it gives you like monotony.

3847
03:37:20,420 --> 03:37:21,780
Just like, it's only him in the casino.

3848
03:37:22,000 --> 03:37:22,760
Yeah, yeah, it is.

3849
03:37:22,920 --> 03:37:24,380
Yeah, only him in this casino.

3850
03:37:24,820 --> 03:37:28,160
And he's like, yeah, but he doesn't tell Axel.

3851
03:37:28,400 --> 03:37:35,660
He's like, yeah, yeah, look at this new casino that like,
that just opened up, but it's actually owned by your

3852
03:37:35,660 --> 03:37:40,160
father-in-law just so he makes sure that you don't fucking
gamble all the money.

3853
03:37:42,480 --> 03:37:43,360
Hey, money laundering.

3854
03:37:43,720 --> 03:37:44,260
Come on.

3855
03:37:44,380 --> 03:37:45,220
It can't be that.

3856
03:37:45,360 --> 03:37:46,780
No, he doesn't even give you real money.

3857
03:37:46,980 --> 03:37:49,400
He just he's like, hey, pays, pays.

3858
03:37:49,940 --> 03:37:50,340
So a lot.

3859

You guys want to do that?

3900
03:40:12,760 --> 03:40:13,280

3939
03:41:02,380 --> 03:41:03,620
Winfield has to res.

3940
03:41:03,980 --> 03:41:05,040
Res or kick.

Winfield, when I said res or kick, Winfield did not,
friends.

03:41:22,120 --> 03:41:23,580
We should kick a sack.

It's time for...

3949
03:41:25,560 --> 03:41:26,600

I don't see him.

3953
03:41:40,210 --> 03:41:40,910
They may have fallen back.

3954
03:41:41,850 --> 03:41:43,350
Oh, I'll throw the axe his back.

3955
03:41:45,110 --> 03:41:45,990

Oh, my God.

03:43:13,270 --> 03:43:13,470
I don't know.

3988
03:43:13,590 --> 03:43:14,530
I'm just...

3989
03:43:19,760 --> 03:43:20,800
One HP on me.

3996
03:43:29,920 --> 03:43:30,260
Okay.

3997
03:43:30,500 --> 03:43:31,240

greatest idea, but it worked, I guess.

4005
03:44:06,900 --> 03:44:08,520
Winfield, why were you a hero?

4006
03:44:11,000 --> 03:44:11,340
Hello.

4007
03:44:12,400 --> 03:44:13,040
Oh my god, hey.

4008
03:44:13,940 --> 03:44:14,820
Never be a hero.

4009
03:44:16,080 --> 03:44:17,360
But I was born to be one.

4010
03:44:17,620 --> 03:44:18,240
Never be a hero.

4011
03:44:19,580 --> 03:44:21,900
Yeah, sometimes you can change your career path.

4012
03:44:25,160 --> 03:44:27,160
What if the world depends on you being a hero?

4013
03:44:27,560 --> 03:44:27,900
No, I don't.

4014
03:44:28,120 --> 03:44:28,940
Die, die, die, die, die, die, die.

4015
03:44:29,800 --> 03:44:30,240
Wait, what?

4016
03:44:30,300 --> 03:44:31,020

03:44:37,600 --> 03:44:38,980

Oh, Winfield.

4026
03:44:50,580 --> 03:44:56,520
If we circle around security gate, it should be a little
bit, it should be a little bit safer, I mean, Axel, okay, I

4027
03:44:56,520 --> 03:45:00,520
was surprised Axel didn't try to redeploy to the other
redeploy.

4028
03:45:00,780 --> 03:45:01,940

03:53:00,410 --> 03:53:03,190
I'm very bravely retreating right now.

4180
03:53:03,650 --> 03:53:06,370
I'm bravely sprinting as fast as I can away from the area.

4181
03:53:07,470 --> 03:53:07,850
Relocating.

4182
03:53:08,330 --> 03:53:09,450
Oh, can I not climb that?

4183
03:53:09,490 --> 03:53:10,070
That's unlucky.

4184
03:53:10,330 --> 03:53:10,710
Okay, wait.

4185
03:53:10,770 --> 03:53:11,870
But what if I...

4186
03:53:12,610 --> 03:53:14,570
There's no way to know I'm up here.

4187
03:53:15,510 --> 03:53:15,910
Skadoosh.

4188
03:53:18,250 --> 03:53:18,930
Good at the dude.

4189
03:53:20,550 --> 03:53:21,350
All right.

4190
03:53:22,090 --> 03:53:24,070
Oh, Winfield's going back in.

4191
03:53:25,510 --> 03:53:25,730
Okay.

4192
03:53:25,970 --> 03:53:26,370
Winfield.

4193
03:53:26,870 --> 03:53:27,270
Winfield.

4194
03:53:27,810 --> 03:53:27,990
Winfield.

4195
03:53:27,990 --> 03:53:28,210
Never mind.

4196
03:53:28,570 --> 03:53:28,970
Winfield.

4197
03:53:30,710 --> 03:53:31,230
Oh, shit.

4198
03:53:31,910 --> 03:53:31,950
Winfield.

4199
03:53:34,310 --> 03:53:35,890
His name's fun to say, at least.

4200
03:53:36,090 --> 03:53:36,430
That's good.

4201
03:53:36,650 --> 03:53:38,710
Yeah, I got a shot from my back, but I don't know from
where.

4202
03:53:40,090 --> 03:53:40,330

03:53:40,370 --> 03:53:41,590

Great game.

4214
03:54:18,670 --> 03:54:19,010
It's okay.

4215
03:54:19,150 --> 03:54:19,430
It's okay.

4216
03:54:20,370 --> 03:54:22,050
I have one more res.

4217
03:54:23,650 --> 03:54:24,090
Axel.

4218
03:54:25,830 --> 03:54:26,830
It's okay, Axel.

4219
03:54:27,770 --> 03:54:28,250
I believe.

4220
03:54:28,430 --> 03:54:30,090
Sniper does not work with this ping.

4221
03:54:30,270 --> 03:54:32,110
It's just so miserable, man.

4222
03:54:32,670 --> 03:54:33,130
Jesus.

4223
03:54:34,050 --> 03:54:34,390
It's okay.

4224
03:54:34,470 --> 03:54:37,910
I'm finding the closest redeployed and I'm going to land
there.

4225
03:54:38,490 --> 03:54:38,870
Ah!

4226
03:54:38,870 --> 03:54:40,970
I checked that entire area.

4227
03:54:41,150 --> 03:54:41,530
He's still there.

4228
03:54:41,810 --> 03:54:41,930
Wait, wait.

4229
03:54:42,270 --> 03:54:43,110
Windfield is safe, though.

4230
03:54:43,350 --> 03:54:44,110
Windfield is safe.

4231
03:54:44,330 --> 03:54:45,870
Wait, we all have read-a-ploys, technically.

4232
03:54:47,350 --> 03:54:48,770
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4233
03:54:48,990 --> 03:54:49,690
We all have read-a-word.

4234
03:54:50,210 --> 03:54:50,830
Don't worry, Windfield.

4235
03:54:50,890 --> 03:54:52,410
I go fly to the read-a-point.

4236
03:54:52,590 --> 03:54:53,190
You live.

4237
03:54:53,370 --> 03:54:54,010
You survive.

4238
03:54:55,910 --> 03:54:56,390
Okay, of course.

4239
03:54:56,390 --> 03:54:56,610
Look at this man.

4240
03:54:56,650 --> 03:54:57,610
He's running with conviction.

4241
03:55:00,650 --> 03:55:02,250
Where's the closest one?

4242
03:55:03,530 --> 03:55:04,430

Oh, my God.

4345
04:03:30,720 --> 04:03:31,960
The zone is still so big.

4346
04:03:32,360 --> 04:03:35,740
If you win this one, I'll give you 10 bucks.

4347
04:03:35,880 --> 04:03:36,180

4450
04:10:28,880 --> 04:10:29,260

04:22:24,850 --> 04:22:25,550
If we decide to move.

4663
04:22:25,670 --> 04:22:25,910
Okay.

4664
04:22:26,750 --> 04:22:29,230

4670
04:22:57,650 --> 04:23:05,090
have a decision together let's I probably have 30 seconds
until my next turn.

4848
04:31:10,570 --> 04:31:12,390
Oh, I knocked one, too.

4849
04:31:13,290 --> 04:31:13,830
No!

4850
04:31:14,890 --> 04:31:16,670
Oh, we should have airstrike the right side.

4851
04:31:17,470 --> 04:31:18,730
Oh, my God.

4852
04:31:18,810 --> 04:31:20,790
See, my strapped worked, guys.

4853
04:31:21,410 --> 04:31:24,270
My strapped was the key.

4854
04:31:25,010 --> 04:31:25,710
My strapped.

4855
04:31:25,810 --> 04:31:28,130

4856
04:31:28,250 --> 04:31:29,490
Oh my god.

4857
04:31:29,510 --> 04:31:30,950
Yeah, we got sandwich hard.

4858
04:31:31,110 --> 04:31:32,770

Oh my gosh!

4862
04:31:42,210 --> 04:31:45,950
How about we just take a small short break, go to the
restroom, get some drinks?

4863
04:31:46,110 --> 04:31:47,350
I mean, technically we went away.

4864
04:31:48,030 --> 04:31:49,030
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

4865
04:31:49,130 --> 04:31:49,870
You a quitter?

4866
04:31:50,370 --> 04:31:51,030
Are you a fucking...

4867
04:31:51,030 --> 04:31:51,530
Or we can just...

4868
04:31:51,530 --> 04:31:52,430
Or we can just...

4869
04:31:52,430 --> 04:31:53,190
I'm just gonna go drink.

4870
04:31:53,750 --> 04:31:55,790
We can just continue another...

4871
04:31:55,790 --> 04:31:57,330
No, no, no, no, this is...

4872
04:31:57,330 --> 04:31:57,850
No, no, no.

4873
04:31:58,250 --> 04:32:00,650
Bro, okay, we got the strat, though.

4874
04:32:01,270 --> 04:32:02,670
We got the strat, Axel.

4875
04:32:03,210 --> 04:32:03,610
Yeah, yeah.

4876
04:32:04,110 --> 04:32:05,770
We have the strat now.

4877
04:32:05,870 --> 04:32:08,890
Like, we had such good rotations, guys.

4878
04:32:09,350 --> 04:32:10,750
Like, that's what we mean.

4879
04:32:10,950 --> 04:32:14,530
Axel, didn't you feel a little bit of the excitement of
V-Scycure back then?

4880
04:32:14,930 --> 04:32:15,110
You know?

4881
04:32:15,350 --> 04:32:17,430
Yeah, did you not feel the rotations?

4882
04:32:17,750 --> 04:32:20,650
Like, oh my God, we were rotating left and right.

4883
04:32:21,070 --> 04:32:23,390
I don't know about that one, bro.

4884
04:32:23,450 --> 04:32:24,110
I don't know.

4885
04:32:24,390 --> 04:32:27,950
No, no, we were rotating left and right, bro.

4886
04:32:28,250 --> 04:32:38,330
we got this oh boss like we got like our bathroom strat or
our base we should go to that same corner again we should

4887
04:32:38,330 --> 04:32:55,390
you're laughing while drinking water yeah i can hear that
it's kind of hard bro this game she's driving guys all i'm

4888
04:32:55,390 --> 04:33:01,110
saying is that we almost made We almost got it there.

4889
04:33:01,470 --> 04:33:02,890
We were so finished, yeah.

4890
04:33:03,130 --> 04:33:03,530
Yeah, to be honest.

4891
04:33:03,850 --> 04:33:04,790
That was, look at that.

4892
04:33:04,890 --> 04:33:06,630
We were fracking out in everything.

4893
04:33:06,830 --> 04:33:09,110
It's just that, unfortunately, we got sandwiched there.

4894
04:33:09,730 --> 04:33:11,690
We got sandwiched really hard.

4895
04:33:13,050 --> 04:33:18,650
I think like when we airstrikes, we should airstrike right
side and ran at them in the right side.

4896
04:33:19,550 --> 04:33:20,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we should do that.

4897
04:33:21,570 --> 04:33:23,970
But we, when we first saw them, we saw them on the left.

4898
04:33:24,090 --> 04:33:26,070
After we airstrike them, they moved to the right side.

4899
04:33:26,090 --> 04:33:27,430
Was that the same team though?

4900
04:33:27,430 --> 04:33:31,130
I think it was it was because the one knock was trying to
move to the right as well.

4901
04:33:31,830 --> 04:33:38,010
Oh, because I was like, I thought that was a I thought that
was a new team because like we were third So I thought the

4902
04:33:38,010 --> 04:33:44,790
other team was to our left and then out the no, I think the
last guy was like a rat somewhere God damn it was us against

4903
04:33:44,790 --> 04:33:48,790
another rat Oh, yeah, it's okay.

heck how they get behind us They were two behind us

4905
04:33:57,430 --> 04:34:03,250

survive the collapsing wall of wildfire.

5006

5047
04:44:03,870 --> 04:44:05,450
Oh, there is someone above us.

5048
04:44:08,150 --> 04:44:08,730

5049
04:44:08,890 --> 04:44:09,470

04:44:10,910 --> 04:44:11,510
They're above there.

5051
04:44:15,130 --> 04:44:16,030
I see them.

5052
04:44:16,190 --> 04:44:16,790
They're on the second floor.

5053
04:44:16,850 --> 04:44:17,470
They're on the second floor.

5054
04:44:17,730 --> 04:44:18,670
Or the third floor.

5055
04:44:19,790 --> 04:44:21,350
They're right here in that room.

5056
04:44:22,650 --> 04:44:22,910
Great.

5057
04:44:24,350 --> 04:44:25,310
One right there.

5058
04:44:25,610 --> 04:44:26,490
I'm going up.

5059
04:44:26,990 --> 04:44:27,250
On ping.

5060
04:44:28,210 --> 04:44:28,890
Gun up as well.

5061
04:44:30,450 --> 04:44:31,590
I think they ran, they ran across.

5062
04:44:32,830 --> 04:44:33,290
They ran across.

5063
04:44:35,650 --> 04:44:36,470
But I'm going down.

5064
04:44:36,470 --> 04:44:37,110
They shot through you.

5065
04:44:37,130 --> 04:44:38,570
They shot through you to kill me.

5066
04:44:39,450 --> 04:44:40,550
I just can't win.

5067
04:44:40,870 --> 04:44:41,810
Like, it's just impossible.

5068
04:44:42,550 --> 04:44:43,210
I'm here.

5069
04:44:43,950 --> 04:44:44,470
Thank you.

5070
04:44:44,490 --> 04:44:44,990
I might need help.

5071
04:44:45,130 --> 04:44:45,610
I might need help.

5072
04:44:45,950 --> 04:44:45,970
Cover.

5073
04:44:45,970 --> 04:44:46,370
I might need cover.

5074
04:44:46,770 --> 04:44:47,150
Okay.

5075
04:44:47,210 --> 04:44:47,830
Maybe I should like...

5076
04:44:47,830 --> 04:44:48,670
Covering, covering, covering.

5077
04:44:49,050 --> 04:44:49,170
Okay.

5078
04:44:51,750 --> 04:44:53,210
They're going to redeploy to us.

5079
04:44:53,350 --> 04:44:53,710
I'm pretty sure.

5080
04:44:53,930 --> 04:44:55,590
Oh, I was behind the wall.

5081
04:44:55,810 --> 04:44:56,370
Oh, my goodness.

5082
04:44:56,590 --> 04:44:56,970
Oh, my God.

5083
04:44:57,290 --> 04:44:58,490
Oh, they killed you!

5084
04:44:58,570 --> 04:44:59,010
You're my gun.

5085
04:44:59,290 --> 04:44:59,470
No!

5086
04:44:59,830 --> 04:45:00,430
I was actually...

5087
04:45:00,450 --> 04:45:02,210
Behind the wall, you shouldn't scare me.

5088
04:45:03,750 --> 04:45:05,110
Hey, what's your...

5089
04:45:05,110 --> 04:45:05,270

5090
04:45:05,550 --> 04:45:06,290

5091
04:45:08,050 --> 04:45:09,950
There's another guy right in here.

5092
04:45:10,310 --> 04:45:10,650

04:45:11,250 --> 04:45:12,130
Okay, that's karma.

5095
04:45:12,310 --> 04:45:14,430
That's actual karma for what I did.

5096
04:45:15,910 --> 04:45:16,930

04:53:45,460 --> 04:53:46,720
That way is where the tank is.

I don't think that's possible.

5225
04:53:56,220 --> 04:53:57,400
Guys, there's nothing.

5226
04:53:57,660 --> 04:53:58,620

Yeah, but I don't think we can get it.

5228
04:54:01,280 --> 04:54:02,840
I think the tank is going to look from above.

5229
04:54:03,300 --> 04:54:04,520
No, it's fine.

5230
04:54:04,660 --> 04:54:06,780

No one will know.

5286
04:56:30,400 --> 04:56:31,200
Well, look at the steam.

04:57:04,820 --> 04:57:05,040
There's a tank.

5306
04:57:05,120 --> 04:57:05,480
No tank.

5307
04:57:05,660 --> 04:57:05,920
No tank.

5308
04:57:06,080 --> 04:57:08,320
We got to wait until the tank, like, leave us.

04:59:56,110 --> 04:59:56,270
Thank you.

5349
04:59:56,990 --> 04:59:57,230
Thank you.

5350
04:59:57,230 --> 04:59:58,830
We gotta go in.

5351
04:59:59,830 --> 05:00:00,030
Yeah.

5352
05:00:00,290 --> 05:00:00,790
Oh, there's me.

5353
05:00:01,230 --> 05:00:01,370
Thank you.

5354
05:00:03,430 --> 05:00:05,510
Um, someone's all the way out here on one ping.

5355
05:00:06,550 --> 05:00:08,190
There's three people north at the house.

5356
05:00:09,950 --> 05:00:11,450
On north on the house.

5357
05:00:11,630 --> 05:00:11,810
Okay.

5358
05:00:12,190 --> 05:00:12,870
So we.

5359
05:00:13,510 --> 05:00:14,830
And there's one person west on ping.

5360
05:00:15,710 --> 05:00:16,630
We gotta go.

5361
05:00:16,890 --> 05:00:18,030
I guess we can go.

5362
05:00:18,450 --> 05:00:19,870
Is there anyone here on three?

5363
05:00:21,010 --> 05:00:23,230
Uh, I saw one person over there.

5364
05:00:24,150 --> 05:00:25,990
Alright, I guess we slowly rotate.

5365
05:00:28,130 --> 05:00:28,930
Our life.

5366
05:00:29,910 --> 05:00:30,310
Okay.

5367
05:00:30,610 --> 05:00:32,150
Oh my god, look at the end zone.

5368
05:00:32,150 --> 05:00:34,050
End zone is like the open field.

5369
05:00:34,430 --> 05:00:34,470
Okay.

5370
05:00:36,590 --> 05:00:37,390
Um, okay.

5371
05:00:37,850 --> 05:00:39,630
Let's try to get some trees for cover then.

5372
05:00:42,510 --> 05:00:46,870
I think all we could do is just we just have to rotate last,
I guess.

5373
05:00:47,850 --> 05:00:48,290
Yep.

5374
05:00:49,390 --> 05:00:49,850
Five squads left.

5375
05:00:50,050 --> 05:00:50,690
Five squads.

5376
05:00:52,010 --> 05:00:52,690
Four squads.

5377
05:00:52,890 --> 05:00:53,790
They killed two rats.

5378
05:00:54,770 --> 05:00:55,030
Nice.

5379
05:00:55,350 --> 05:00:56,350
They killed three more squads.

5380
05:00:56,550 --> 05:00:57,170
Three more squads.

5381
05:00:57,690 --> 05:01:01,570
I don't have any artillery, by the way, so two more squads.

5382
05:01:01,830 --> 05:01:02,650
Two more squads.

5383
05:01:05,090 --> 05:01:05,850
Hi, battle.

5384
05:01:06,890 --> 05:01:09,110
He's got to use the artillery strike.

5385
05:01:10,170 --> 05:01:11,030
Do we have artillery?

5386
05:01:11,350 --> 05:01:13,210
I don't think any of us have artillery, yeah.

5387
05:01:13,730 --> 05:01:14,910
We gotta go something.

5388
05:01:16,470 --> 05:01:18,650
Remember, there's still people above us, so...

5389
05:01:19,390 --> 05:01:19,430
Really?

5390
05:01:19,830 --> 05:01:20,890
We swat right.

5391
05:01:21,010 --> 05:01:21,730
No, we swat right.

5392
05:01:21,990 --> 05:01:22,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5393
05:01:22,310 --> 05:01:22,610
Sorry, I'm sorry.

5394
05:01:23,290 --> 05:01:23,490
You're right.

5395
05:01:23,570 --> 05:01:24,190
It should be fine.

5396
05:01:24,610 --> 05:01:27,650
Unless there's another person right behind us.

5397
05:01:29,370 --> 05:01:30,350
Oh, the fire.

5398
05:01:31,110 --> 05:01:31,210
Oh!

5399
05:01:31,870 --> 05:01:32,090
Artillery!

5400
05:01:32,470 --> 05:01:33,270
How did they know?

5401
05:01:33,670 --> 05:01:34,990
That's a...

5402
05:01:34,990 --> 05:01:35,530
Oh my god.

5403
05:01:35,530 --> 05:01:36,550
I took a big hit.

5404
05:01:36,810 --> 05:01:37,390
I took a big hit.

5405
05:01:37,710 --> 05:01:39,650
I don't know how they knew we were there, but...

5406
05:01:40,630 --> 05:01:40,890
Oh!

5407
05:01:41,610 --> 05:01:43,670
They just crashed on it.

5408
05:01:43,830 --> 05:01:44,390
They just crashed on it.

5409
05:01:44,390 --> 05:01:44,710
Oh my god.

5410
05:01:46,250 --> 05:01:49,150

He's literally right in front of me.

5423
05:03:06,410 --> 05:03:07,150
We got a danger point.

5424
05:03:07,270 --> 05:03:08,810
Oh wait, they downed each other.

5425
05:03:10,050 --> 05:03:10,790

05:03:53,970 --> 05:03:55,110
Oh, my God.

5448

How are you guys all doing, ladies and gentlemen?

5458
05:05:25,780 --> 05:05:27,100
This game is ass.

5459
05:05:31,440 --> 05:05:32,560
It's not like Apex.

5460
05:05:32,760 --> 05:05:35,000
You can't just fight them even with ping.

5461
05:05:36,280 --> 05:05:38,000
You are, you are fucked.

5462
05:05:39,380 --> 05:05:42,500
You are just absolutely fucked if you have shit ping.

5463
05:05:44,860 --> 05:05:46,920
Oh, what's a good fucking...

5464
05:05:50,120 --> 05:05:51,960
So what's this?

5465
05:05:59,110 --> 05:05:59,710
Carbine?

5466
05:06:09,690 --> 05:06:11,290
What's a better gun?

5467
05:06:17,850 --> 05:06:18,170
Assault?

5468
05:06:23,910 --> 05:06:24,510
This?

5469
05:06:25,450 --> 05:06:26,850
Firing range, okay?

5470
05:06:31,870 --> 05:06:33,750
Oh, I actually like this gun more.

5471
05:06:35,290 --> 05:06:37,510
The M4 is the best gun at the end of the day.

5472
05:06:41,890 --> 05:06:42,370
Hey.

5473
05:06:43,690 --> 05:06:43,810

Thank you very much.

5476
05:07:11,440 --> 05:07:13,260
But if I were to...

5477
05:07:14,320 --> 05:07:20,320
If I were to use this gun in hyping, I don't think it would
do much, to be honest.

5478
05:07:22,180 --> 05:07:23,140
How do I...

5479
05:07:23,140 --> 05:07:23,980
Hello, I'm back.

5480
05:07:24,640 --> 05:07:25,040

I'm just in the firing range.

5492
05:08:26,110 --> 05:08:27,690
Why is it when I look this way?

5493
05:08:28,190 --> 05:08:29,710

05:10:29,170 --> 05:10:29,750
We're gonna be winners.

5524
05:10:30,090 --> 05:10:33,510
You're literally talking about you wanting Italian pizza.

5525
05:10:35,430 --> 05:10:35,830
Okay.

5526
05:10:36,510 --> 05:10:39,910
So what's the difference between like Italian pizza and
regular pizza?

5527
05:10:41,630 --> 05:10:43,850
Is it like the way they make it?

5528
05:10:43,890 --> 05:10:45,510
Do they make it in stone ovens?

5529
05:10:45,570 --> 05:10:47,130
Do they flop it a little bit?

5530
05:10:47,690 --> 05:10:48,690
What do they do?

5531
05:10:49,470 --> 05:10:50,750
It's the pressed spinner.

5532
05:10:51,970 --> 05:10:54,910
Oh, like New York style pizza.

5533
05:10:55,950 --> 05:10:57,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5534
05:10:59,630 --> 05:11:02,470
Italian pizza doesn't default to tomato sauce.

5535
05:11:02,870 --> 05:11:04,470
What do they use?

5536
05:11:04,610 --> 05:11:04,910
Like mayonnaise?

5537
05:11:11,690 --> 05:11:12,170
Mayonnaise?

5538
05:11:12,470 --> 05:11:12,590
What?

5539
05:11:12,770 --> 05:11:14,950
Sorry, I was fucking typing a word message.

5540
05:11:17,510 --> 05:11:18,230
What the fuck?

5541
05:11:18,290 --> 05:11:20,430
I had to like do a double take on that.

5542
05:11:21,710 --> 05:11:28,050
huh well they said that italian pizza doesn't default to
tomato sauce so like it's got mayonnaise it's got to be a

5543
05:11:28,050 --> 05:11:40,110
ketchup sauce mayonnaise berry jam what peanut butter pizza
that's good peanut butter pizza i hate peanut butter i'm

5544
05:11:40,110 --> 05:11:49,670
sorry there's just something about the nuttyness that's too
much i got stuff crushed for for my pizza hut i haven't had

5545
05:11:49,670 --> 05:11:53,350
that in so long soft crust is so good there.

5546
05:11:58,910 --> 05:12:05,670
If you had to have one, only one ingredient on the top of
the pizza, what would you have?

5547
05:12:06,150 --> 05:12:06,530
Only one.

5548
05:12:07,350 --> 05:12:08,350
Only one.

5549
05:12:09,530 --> 05:12:12,150
For me, unironically, Italian sausage.

5550
05:12:12,630 --> 05:12:12,650
Really?

5551
05:12:12,830 --> 05:12:14,030
For me, it's pepperoni.

5552
05:12:14,890 --> 05:12:15,450
Pepperoni?

5553
05:12:16,250 --> 05:12:21,690
Like the good ones are the ones that like shrivel up too
much and are like plastic.

5554
05:12:21,710 --> 05:12:31,390
I mean you just said the good ones or the one that's bad
like I don't talk to girls very often I mean girls are the

5555
05:12:31,390 --> 05:12:43,870
ones that's fucking bad I don't know my mom likes sparkling
water I don't get it I don't know is my thing bog what is

5556
05:12:43,870 --> 05:12:52,230
what a poke is my screen of black um we're in game yeah I
think it's bogged oh Oh, no.

5557
05:12:53,230 --> 05:12:55,170
Maybe, like, alt tab and tab back in?

5558
05:12:56,830 --> 05:12:57,210
No, it's not.

5559
05:12:57,310 --> 05:12:58,550
I think it's just...

5560
05:12:58,550 --> 05:13:00,110
I think this game's broken.

5561
05:13:00,670 --> 05:13:01,170
Oh, no.

5562
05:13:01,170 --> 05:13:01,970
I'm in the void.

5563
05:13:02,710 --> 05:13:04,750
Maybe it'll fix once you get out of skydiving.

5564
05:13:05,850 --> 05:13:06,290
Yeah.

5565
05:13:06,630 --> 05:13:08,170
I don't think so.

5566
05:13:08,210 --> 05:13:08,630
We're in.

5567
05:13:09,830 --> 05:13:11,590
Yeah, no, I don't see anything.

5568
05:13:11,750 --> 05:13:13,750
Okay, maybe it'll fix itself when you die.

5569
05:13:16,030 --> 05:13:16,470
Nope.

5570
05:13:18,830 --> 05:13:21,450

5625
05:16:38,200 --> 05:16:39,380
How do you do that?

5626
05:16:40,740 --> 05:16:41,620
What the fuck?

5627
05:16:42,140 --> 05:16:42,900

Don't worry.

05:16:57,280 --> 05:16:58,620
I'm going to be a hero.

5633
05:17:00,700 --> 05:17:01,680
That was a dry bite.

5634
05:17:01,980 --> 05:17:02,160
Wow.

05:17:03,880 --> 05:17:04,840

05:17:08,720 --> 05:17:09,520
Okay, I'm here.

5638
05:17:12,860 --> 05:17:13,800
Guys, I'm here.

5639
05:17:15,080 --> 05:17:15,380
Hello.

5644
05:17:24,020 --> 05:17:24,800
Merci beaucoup.

5645
05:17:25,780 --> 05:17:26,660
Don't worry, Altair.

5646
05:17:28,080 --> 05:17:29,120
We can do this.

5647
05:17:29,740 --> 05:17:32,720
We might be at the five-hour mark, but we can do this.

5648
05:17:34,080 --> 05:17:37,180
We can do this.

5649
05:17:37,200 --> 05:17:38,400
Hey, we just need one good one.

5650
05:17:38,640 --> 05:17:40,320
You know, we can fail as many times as we want.

5651
05:17:40,460 --> 05:17:40,700
Yeah.

5652
05:17:40,820 --> 05:17:41,780
Just gotta win one time.

5653
05:17:42,100 --> 05:17:42,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5654
05:17:42,900 --> 05:17:44,080
We got the win.

5655
05:17:44,500 --> 05:17:44,980
We got it.

5656
05:17:45,100 --> 05:17:45,580
We got it.

5657
05:17:45,620 --> 05:17:45,900
We got it.

5658
05:17:45,900 --> 05:17:46,660
I believe, I believe.

5659
05:17:48,260 --> 05:17:50,940
We might need to sacrifice a couple along the way.

5660
05:17:51,620 --> 05:17:53,300
And that may or may not be Winfield.

5661
05:17:53,640 --> 05:17:54,820
I'm going to eat my pizza.

5662

session.

Maybe there's rats in that water.

5817
05:30:02,350 --> 05:30:03,750

05:31:53,940 --> 05:31:55,780
in the middle of that ocean.

5855
05:31:57,120 --> 05:32:01,120
Oh, this hurts my soul.

5856
05:32:01,340 --> 05:32:03,240
This is such a cowardly way to fight.

5857
05:32:03,660 --> 05:32:04,800
Two bros across the hallway.

5858
05:32:06,780 --> 05:32:07,660
Two bros.

5859
05:32:08,020 --> 05:32:10,920
Looking at each other because there's nothing else to do.

5860
05:32:11,000 --> 05:32:12,180
Yeah, two bros.

5861
05:32:12,500 --> 05:32:13,720
Sitting in the hot tub.

5862
05:32:14,720 --> 05:32:16,740
Five in the car because they're not gay.

5863
05:32:20,840 --> 05:32:21,920
Fuck, I love that.

5864
05:32:22,260 --> 05:32:23,740
Two bros sitting in the hot tub.

5865
05:32:23,940 --> 05:32:25,940
5p in the park is not gay

5866
05:32:30,920 --> 05:32:32,160
We're not in the zen.

5867
05:32:32,740 --> 05:32:33,700
Oh, no, no, it's fine.

5868
05:32:33,840 --> 05:32:33,960
It's fine.

5869
05:32:34,080 --> 05:32:44,040
The zone closes really slow I believe okay, there's no way
people throw grenades to check No, they wouldn't they

5870
05:32:44,040 --> 05:32:55,260
wouldn't there's no way there's no way nobody ever throws
grenades in this game Nope Oh Oh.

5871
05:32:57,020 --> 05:32:57,460
I'm still here.

5872
05:32:57,620 --> 05:32:58,280
I'm safe.

5873
05:32:58,380 --> 05:32:58,660
No.

5874
05:33:03,740 --> 05:33:04,020
Oh.

5875
05:33:05,340 --> 05:33:05,540
Oh.

5876
05:33:05,820 --> 05:33:06,120
Oh.

5877
05:33:06,120 --> 05:33:06,620
There's someone on Winfield.

5878
05:33:06,700 --> 05:33:07,340
There's someone on Winfield.

5879
05:33:08,200 --> 05:33:08,380
Okay.

5880
05:33:08,480 --> 05:33:08,760
I gotta heal.

5881
05:33:08,880 --> 05:33:09,900
I gotta heal.

5882
05:33:15,620 --> 05:33:16,020
No.

5883
05:33:16,120 --> 05:33:16,140
Where?

5884
05:33:16,140 --> 05:33:16,320
Where?

5885
05:33:16,620 --> 05:33:17,020
Um.

5886
05:33:17,300 --> 05:33:18,120
Just chill a bit.

5887
05:33:18,140 --> 05:33:18,520
Just chill.

5888
05:33:18,660 --> 05:33:19,500
It's C-Swiss 2.

5889
05:33:19,580 --> 05:33:20,540
You got this.

5890
05:33:22,400 --> 05:33:23,960
They're really on Winfield right now.

5891
05:33:25,380 --> 05:33:25,780
No!

5892
05:33:26,040 --> 05:33:26,440
No!

5893
05:33:27,760 --> 05:33:28,200
Winfield!

5894
05:33:28,600 --> 05:33:29,780
Whoa, whoa.

5895
05:33:30,000 --> 05:33:30,560
Altair, nice.

5896
05:33:31,100 --> 05:33:32,720
Altair, I think you gotta leave him.

5897
05:33:33,340 --> 05:33:34,340
Oh my god, never mind.

5898
05:33:34,580 --> 05:33:35,120
I will never leave Winfield.

5899
05:33:35,320 --> 05:33:36,000
Never leave him.

5900
05:33:36,020 --> 05:33:36,820
I will never leave you!

5901
05:33:37,620 --> 05:33:40,300
Oh my god, two bros sitting in the hot tub.

5902
05:33:41,360 --> 05:33:42,080
It was very hot.

5903
05:33:42,980 --> 05:33:43,520
I see them.

5904
05:33:43,600 --> 05:33:44,100
They're across.

5905
05:33:44,380 --> 05:33:44,840
Okay, just chill.

5906
05:33:44,960 --> 05:33:45,260
Just chill.

5907
05:33:45,720 --> 05:33:46,160
Oh, last.

5908
05:33:46,680 --> 05:33:47,640
It's the last team.

5909
05:33:47,880 --> 05:33:48,920
It's literally the last team.

5910
05:33:49,520 --> 05:33:49,540
Bye!

5911
05:33:49,680 --> 05:33:49,860
Bye!

5912
05:33:50,320 --> 05:33:50,620
Left!

5913
05:33:53,460 --> 05:33:53,900
No!

5914
05:33:54,920 --> 05:33:55,000
No!

5915
05:33:55,000 --> 05:33:55,220
No!

5916
05:33:57,680 --> 05:33:58,360
Again!

5917
05:34:00,920 --> 05:34:01,240
Again!

5918
05:34:02,440 --> 05:34:05,060
It was literally one guy left!

5919
05:34:08,380 --> 05:34:10,680
I thought I saw someone in front of me.

5920
05:34:13,660 --> 05:34:17,540
Okay, I would say that aim was very unfortunate to watch
too.

5921
05:34:17,980 --> 05:34:20,080
I'm glad you didn't have to watch it out here.

5922
05:34:20,800 --> 05:34:24,100
I'm glad you didn't have to watch it.

5923
05:34:24,680 --> 05:34:28,400
I, I don't, what happened, Winfield?

5924
05:34:28,680 --> 05:34:29,220
It was bad.

5925
05:34:29,440 --> 05:34:31,560
What, Winfield, what, you were clutching it.

5926
05:34:32,040 --> 05:34:32,860
What happened?

5927
05:34:33,140 --> 05:34:34,440
What the fuck happened?

5928
05:34:34,520 --> 05:34:35,720
Okay, we got to invite Axel back.

5929
05:34:36,100 --> 05:34:36,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5930
05:34:37,380 --> 05:34:38,940
Oh, the next one might be my last one.

5931
05:34:38,980 --> 05:34:39,780
I'm so tired.

5932
05:34:39,940 --> 05:34:40,600
No, no, this is it.

5933
05:34:40,620 --> 05:34:42,340
This Axel, we clearly got second place.

5934
05:34:42,880 --> 05:34:43,940
It was one guy.

5935
05:34:44,180 --> 05:34:45,420
The fact that it was one guy.

5936
05:34:46,440 --> 05:34:47,900
I'm so sad.

5937
05:34:48,100 --> 05:34:48,900
Axel, we got this.

5938
05:34:48,940 --> 05:34:49,560
Come on.

5939
05:34:52,560 --> 05:34:53,440
Come on.

5940
05:34:54,100 --> 05:34:55,420
I mean, I'll go in one.

5941
05:34:55,520 --> 05:34:56,060
I'll go in one.

5942
05:34:56,380 --> 05:34:56,880
But after that.

5943
05:34:57,180 --> 05:34:58,520
Battle set me a number.

5944
05:34:59,340 --> 05:35:02,780
When an account name is changed, should we add battle as a
fourth?

5945
05:35:02,980 --> 05:35:03,140
Yeah.

5946
05:35:03,500 --> 05:35:03,620
Yeah.

5947
05:35:03,940 --> 05:35:04,720
Get battle in.

5948
05:35:05,520 --> 05:35:06,820
Spiritually, he is Axel.

5949
05:35:07,760 --> 05:35:09,020
Hey, Winfield, you've been great.

5950
05:35:09,080 --> 05:35:10,200
Thank you very much for...

5951
05:35:10,200 --> 05:35:10,540
Thanks for...

5952
05:35:10,540 --> 05:35:11,400
Thanks for carrying us, man.

5953
05:35:11,500 --> 05:35:11,760
Thanks.

5954
05:35:13,260 --> 05:35:13,800
Take out.

5955
05:35:14,740 --> 05:35:15,840
Don't worry, Winfield.

5956
05:35:16,780 --> 05:35:18,080
I'm so tired.

5957
05:35:18,580 --> 05:35:19,020
Holy fuck.

5958
05:35:19,800 --> 05:35:20,660
I'm dying.

5959
05:35:20,860 --> 05:35:21,740
Sorry, Axel.

5960
05:35:22,080 --> 05:35:23,920

Oh, but it's still not in.

5967

5968
05:36:12,900 --> 05:36:13,980
I can't kick people out.

5969
05:36:14,000 --> 05:36:14,160

A sad battle.

You won't need a location, bro.

5998
05:38:03,660 --> 05:38:04,820
Yeah, honestly, you don't.

Your own room is fine.

6001
05:38:08,120 --> 05:38:09,420
You're not in battle with what we're called.

6002
05:38:09,760 --> 05:38:10,240
What we're not called.

6003
05:38:10,540 --> 05:38:11,080
Where are you called?

6004
05:38:11,220 --> 05:38:13,420
Also, what the fuck is your PNG battle?

05:38:13,680 --> 05:38:14,160
Like, what?

6006
05:38:14,440 --> 05:38:15,140
It's a puppet.

6007
05:38:15,440 --> 05:38:15,880
I'm a puppet.

6008
05:38:16,820 --> 05:38:17,500
It's a cute puppet.

6009
05:38:17,940 --> 05:38:18,440
I'm a puppet.

6010
05:38:18,480 --> 05:38:19,900
What the fuck is that?

6011
05:38:20,600 --> 05:38:21,660
Wait, he looks just like...

That's right.

6013
05:38:25,700 --> 05:38:26,820
We're judging you.

6014
05:38:27,360 --> 05:38:28,280
I'm an idol.

6396
05:55:28,400 --> 05:55:28,820

6397
05:55:28,940 --> 05:55:29,460

6398
05:55:29,500 --> 05:55:29,960
Watch your left.

6399
05:55:31,680 --> 05:55:33,280
Wait, there's a case right here in front of you.

6400
05:55:33,320 --> 05:55:34,040
Hide, just behind us.

6401
05:55:34,420 --> 05:55:34,580
Okay.

6402
05:55:34,600 --> 05:55:34,980

05:55:38,420 --> 05:55:39,140
It's dead, dead, dead.

6406
05:55:39,700 --> 05:55:40,740
On your left.

6407
05:55:41,060 --> 05:55:41,340
All right.

6408
05:55:43,280 --> 05:55:46,220
Let's, uh, let's go together.

6409
05:55:46,560 --> 05:55:46,740
Axel is going.

6410
05:55:47,080 --> 05:55:47,320
I have no shields.

6411
05:55:47,480 --> 05:55:48,000
I have no shields.

6412
05:55:48,160 --> 05:55:49,580
Oh, I have.

6413
05:55:49,800 --> 05:55:50,020
Shield, shield.

6414
05:55:51,940 --> 05:55:52,980
Thank you.

6415
05:55:53,480 --> 05:55:55,240
I'm following Axel right now.

6416
05:55:56,260 --> 05:55:56,860
Are you fighting someone?

6417
05:55:57,860 --> 05:55:58,820
Yeah, just a vehicle.

6418
05:55:58,960 --> 05:55:59,500
They ran off.

6419
05:56:00,100 --> 05:56:00,120
Okay.

6420
05:56:00,740 --> 05:56:03,160
Uh, I'm looking below us just in case.

6421
05:56:04,800 --> 05:56:06,620
Making sure there's nobody right behind us.

6422
05:56:06,720 --> 05:56:07,480
I like this car.

6423
05:56:07,740 --> 05:56:08,480
It's very safe.

6424
05:56:09,440 --> 05:56:09,720
Uh-huh.

6425
05:56:09,900 --> 05:56:10,100
Sure.

6426
05:56:10,760 --> 05:56:11,120
Okay.

6427
05:56:13,120 --> 05:56:14,500
There's people in front of us.

6428
05:56:14,580 --> 05:56:14,720
Okay.

6429
05:56:15,260 --> 05:56:15,620
Yeah.

6430
05:56:17,140 --> 05:56:18,580
Are they in a vehicle or what?

6431
05:56:20,120 --> 05:56:20,620
Bad position.

6432
05:56:22,220 --> 05:56:23,900
I don't know how I can shoot that.

6433
05:56:24,060 --> 05:56:24,360
Careful training.

6434
05:56:24,520 --> 05:56:26,340
There's people on the street as well and up the hill.

6435
05:56:26,760 --> 05:56:27,860
I see the guy right here.

6436
05:56:28,820 --> 05:56:29,540
There's multiple.

6437
05:56:34,080 --> 05:56:35,720
I'm shooting the guy under the truck right now.

6438
05:56:36,300 --> 05:56:38,480
I don't see the guys on the hill right now.

6439
05:56:38,920 --> 05:56:39,520
I mean, I have smoke.

6440
05:56:40,060 --> 05:56:40,960
This is...

6441
05:56:41,600 --> 05:56:42,260
Where are we going?

6442
05:56:42,360 --> 05:56:42,580
Where are you going?

6443
05:56:42,600 --> 05:56:43,320
I can smoke us.

6444
05:56:43,860 --> 05:56:44,600
Just keep going.

6445
05:56:46,720 --> 05:56:47,920
Yeah, just watch up ahead.

05:56:48,340 --> 05:56:48,520
Yeah.

6447
05:56:53,960 --> 05:56:55,880
It's gotta be on our left as well.

6448
05:56:55,980 --> 05:56:56,240
Alright.

6449
05:56:58,100 --> 05:56:58,820

05:57:00,420 --> 05:57:01,120
Behind this hedge here.

6452
05:57:02,020 --> 05:57:02,580

6453
05:57:02,720 --> 05:57:04,180

I have no shields.

6461
05:57:16,260 --> 05:57:17,520
Watch behind it, too.

6462
