I'm like, you're just, to me, I'm like, you seem quiet.

29
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,260
I can't go up any higher.

30
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,400
I can, though.

31
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,380

Yeah.

39
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:20,680
And the Go XLR is what's annoying me.

40
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,400
So bad.

41
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,340

concert, the Elgato, the little small Elgato mic.

48
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:41,820
I just used that.

49
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:51,960

metal gear solid delta snake eater this is a game picked by

72
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:53,130
a fellow dragon for winning one of the charity Yeah, this is
a, I honestly have no idea any of the lore of the Metal Gear

73
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:54,190
main series.

74
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,850
I know I played Metal Gear.

75
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:56,850
What?

76
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:03,270
Do you know which game this is like in the chrono, like in
the order of like one, two, three, four, five?

77
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:04,830
Like, isn't this a third game?

78
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,670
Wouldn't it be the third game in the order?

79
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,050
Is it not one, two, three, four?

80
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,130
Like, is it not chronological?

81
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:13,810
No.

82
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:14,490
What's the fuck?

83
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,230
Why the fuck?

84
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,550
Why is it not chronological?

85
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:17,690
This is the third game in the series.

86
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,530
But it's the first game in the timeline.

87
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:25,190
Why didn't say, like, why is it not like Metal Gear Zero?

88
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:28,650
Why is it Metal Gear Delta?

89
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,010
Metal Gear Solid 3.

90
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:36,690
Yeah, but if it's the third game, but it's a prequel, then
why won't they just call it Metal Gear Zero?

91
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:38,650
Because...

92
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,130
Or Metal Gear Prequel.

93
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:42,210
Because Zero is not the main character.

94
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:43,030
Snake is.

95
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:47,390

Snake.

138
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:09,370
Oh, this is my favorite part.

139
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,050
You have to start the game.

140
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,030
You have to start the game.

141
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,670
You have to start the game to put it on.

142
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:15,570
There's a food collection.

143
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:16,650
Oh, my God.

144
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:20,050
Wait, what if I play snake versus monkey?

145
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:22,170
Sometimes you might shit your pants.

146
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,330
Oh, oh.

147
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,470
This is a different game, by the way.

148
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:29,930
This is not the main game, but there's monkeys in this game.

149
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,310
It's literally called snake versus monkey.

150
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,210
It's not called Metal Gear Solid Delta Snake Eater.

151
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:39,230
I thought it was like the subtitle of a subtitle.

152
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,110
I'm sorry, but we need it.

153
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,450
Something big is going down.

154
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,450
Very big.

155
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,290
Oh my god.

156
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,730

00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:22,790
this era.

Is he dead or alive?

162
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:33,490
He's alive, but he's like this guy that is talking to him is
not supposed to know him.

163
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:35,750
Wait, who's not supposed to know who?

164
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:36,730

Snake?

166
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:41,010
Snake is not supposed to know the Colonel that you're
talking to.

167
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:42,490
Okay, but he knows me.

168
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:44,990
Not yet.

169
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:49,310
It's like a time How would he how does he not know snake?

170
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:49,730
He's there.

171
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:53,570
He's metal gear solid Don't say that he's John metal gear.

172
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:58,090
Yeah, he's literally John metal gear It's like so it's like
him not knowing who James Bond is.

173
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:00,070
How does he not know who I am?

174
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,610
Isn't this just some monkey catching action snake?

175
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,750
I'm asking monkey catching action.

176
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:07,690
It's a request from the professor himself Who's the
professor?

177
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:10,650
Natalie who the fuck is Natalie?

178
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:17,750
The one who came up with the monkey helmet the monkey helmet
I was like, yeah.

179
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:23,090
There's no context for clues for any of this.

180
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,870
He's Otacon's friend too.

181
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,830
Oh, is Otacon Ocelot?

182
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,810
That Otacon has been able to come up with.

183
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,090
Otacon is Otacon.

184
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,850
Why would Otacon be Ocelot?

185
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:32,870
Don't be burned.

186
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:33,650
Use your brain.

187
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,990
Why would they be the same person?

188
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:36,830
I don't know.

189
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,930
Maybe he's like the father of Ocelot.

190
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,870
Because they both start with, oh.

191
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,850
No, the father of Ocelot.

192
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:47,370
Atacon, Acelot.

193
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:48,590
It rhymes.

194
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:51,870
Atacon is not even alive right now.

195
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,130
He's like not even alive.

196
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:54,910
He's dead.

197
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,630
Why did you smell that for me?

198
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,930
He's a single-celled organism at this moment.

199
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,730
He's a sperm right now.

200
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,630
He's not even been born yet?

201
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:06,910
No.

202
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,850
Wait, then who's his dad?

203
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,730
Whose sperm is it?

204
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:12,350
Acelot?

205
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:13,790

Oh, you're not a very good backseat it.

It's like parking, you know How could you miss?

247

He was right?

248
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,770
It has a shield!

249
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,870
I'm parallel parking right now.

250
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:24,750
I'm just parallel.

251
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:25,530
What the fuck?

252
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,250
He's just climbing up.

253
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:28,870
Oh my god.

254
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:29,710
Yeah, because he's a monkey.

255
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:31,010
I know.

256
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:31,970
Will he fall down?

00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:34,770
Alright, here we go.

00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,750
Alright, gotcha.

260
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:40,010
Okay, I gotta figure this out.

261
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,210
Oh, there we go.

262
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:42,470
Got you?

263
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,490
There you go.

264
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,770
I still don't know which one's prone.

265
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,490
Okay, I figured it out.

266
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,630
All right, I need it.

267
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:51,290
Good job.

268
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:52,950
I need three more.

269
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:54,390
Four more I can't count.

270
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,090
Four more.

271
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:56,690
Four more.

272
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:57,250
Can't count, everybody.

273
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,690
She miscounted the intro too.

274
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:00,490
Morning.

275
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:02,570
No, it's not morning.

276
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,190
Oh, my God.

277
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:03,810
I'm dying.

278
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:04,950
What do you mean morning?

279
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:05,670
I'm already dead.

280
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,110
Oh, there he is.

281
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,850
Look at him.

00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,090
Look at him.

283
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:08,270
Look at him.

284
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,010
There's a guy right there.

285
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:10,350
He's just eating.

286
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:12,230
He was eating.

287
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:13,750

is an FPS game.

291
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,430
Why am I using a controller?

292
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:52,790
It's not FPS.

293
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,570
Oh, you got it in a box.

294
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:55,870
How is it not an FPS?

295
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,250
I'm literally shooting him.

296
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,010
Are you in first person?

297
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:01,910
Oh, it's a TPS.

298
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:03,930
This is a TPS game.

299
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,390
Oh, hey, AstroBot.

300
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:06,210
It's your favorite.

301
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:07,830
I know.

302
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,290
This game was mid for me.

303
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:09,930
Wait.

304
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:10,830
Gamers don't look up.

305
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:11,730
Gamers don't look up.

306
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,510
What the fuck?

307
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,510
But how did you know?

308
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,710
Because I played this.

309
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,770
Oh, it's like they're the same pose all the time.

310
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:27,870
Yeah.

311
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,670
Oh, it's because the Astro Bot.

312
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:31,310
The Astro Bot thing.

313
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:34,230
Oh my god, the record was one minute.

314
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,830
Because like in Astro Bot, he was in the tree.

315
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:39,830
I remember because I remember that clip of you freaking the
fuck out.

316
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:41,550
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

317
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:42,110
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

318
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:43,970
Okay, let's get this down a little.

319
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:55,370
little too high but i'm at 60 frames how the fuck is it that
all right medium are you lagging oh my god yeah i am i gotta

320
00:19:55,370 --> 00:20:05,330
turn this turn motion blur off we'll do medium oh that was
just like a a test you know we did the mini game first to

321
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:13,290
test out the frame rate yeah the graphic settings and
everything all right now oh wait there's subtitles oh yeah

322
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:17,510
well yeah you'll want those on 100%.

323
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:21,630
Let's make it big in-game subtitles.

324
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:25,310
So I know if people know I'm there.

325
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,310
Oh, I should have their names on, too.

326
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:29,910
Because I don't know who any of them are.

327
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:31,110
Oh, yeah.

328
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,250
And I do that, too.

329
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:32,710
It's helpful.

330
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:33,910
All right.

331
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:36,110
I wish more games would allow that, honestly.

332
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,070
Yeah, honestly.

333
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:41,130
Because, like, what if, like, I just have zero context about
everything?

334
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,570
Like, how am I supposed to know their names?

335
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:43,090
Like now.

336
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,150
Yeah, like now.

337
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,350
Okay, here we go.

338
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:54,030
I'm playing the Metal Gear Solid series for the first time.

339
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:55,310
For the first time.

340
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:56,190
Yeah.

341
00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:00,330
Aiming is done in first person view freely, which is better.

342
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:05,270
First person or third person?

343
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,470
I mean, I get to see his ass more.

344
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,070
You still get to aim.

345
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,050
Yeah, you get to aim in first person in the legacy.

346
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:25,030
in first person and new style too if you switch it so it's
like not it's not you can pick whichever one okay people are

347
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:31,810
saying new is better all right it's it is easier like the
sea style okay so european extreme why do the europeans have

348
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:37,610
their own game mode like you should oh wait you should do
that one you should do that one i thought it's locked what

349
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:46,690
do you mean game over upon being detected by the enemy it'll
be like the fastest stream i get died from the first person

350
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:48,370
and they were like, all right, three's over, guys.

351
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:49,010
But why?

352
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:49,570
Yeah, that's it.

353
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:53,330
I like how the Europeans get their own fucking game mode.

354
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,030
Like, yeah.

355
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:55,610
All right, normal.

356
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,330
They're just feel different.

357
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:59,270
You all, all right.

358
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,010
Yeah, normal's good.

359
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:08,500
After the end of World War II, World War II was split into
two.

360
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,180
Which side are we on?

361
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,380
Wait, why can't I see your screen?

362
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:13,780
Oh, there it is.

363
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,680
Oh, wait, so I had to up the volume a little bit more.

364
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,000
Okay.

365
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:18,620
Alright.

366
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,240
Konami presents.

367
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,120
Alright, sound guy, up the game a bit more.

368
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,300
Let me know if it's better.

369
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,280
Based on Metal Gear Solid 3.

370
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:32,280
Yeah.

371
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,220
Whoa.

372
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,880
Which is the good side?

373
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:37,520
Huh?

374
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,660
So they're like, we're on the good side.

375
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,340
But which one's the good one?

376
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:43,800
Oh.

377
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,500
Oh

378
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:07,260
20 minutes to drop off commencing internal depressurization.

379
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:13,700
Oh my god, Johnny's combat Is that is that solid snake?

380
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,920

why it says major above him oh major oscillot yeah exactly

382
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:35,160
exactly exactly okay that's major that's is that is that
metal gear solid that's metal gear solid yeah john metal

383
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:40,760

384
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:51,960
no that guy's from that guy is a cameo from ace call combat

meligere and there's osseolot and then osseolot yeah what do

386
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:14,960
you think the girl's name is i don't know jenny wait there's
wait there's female characters in meligere oh my

387
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,360
That's the only one I remember.

388
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,040
That's the only one you know.

389
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,260
That's the only one I know.

390
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:33,380
Because like, because the whole fear, the game theory that
the reason why she's like partially naked is because she

391
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,580
needs to breathe through her skin.

392
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,460
That's not the game theory.

393
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,440
That's the real reason.

394
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,860
That's the reason why I remember who quiet is.

395
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:51,160
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

396
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,400
The game theory.

397
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,540
Sorry, the game lore.

398
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,960
That smells good.

399
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,040
The game theory.

400
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:05,180
Yeah.

401
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:12,260
Okay, you're about to do something that is like for the
history books.

402
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,500
The world's first.

403
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,600
Oh my god, I'm meeting the Guinness World Records.

404
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,020
10 seconds to drop off.

405
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:23,340
Yeah, yeah, except not because nobody is allowed to know
that this is happening Yeah, but then like later on like

406
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:31,380
after like, you know, we win the war then like we can I can
be public about it Oh If you win.

407
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:31,920
Yeah.

408
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:32,420
Yeah.

409
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:40,360
If our side wins Yeah The good side right The good side the
good side.

410
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:45,220
Yeah Oh my god, look at me girl.

411
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:48,500
I'm doing back lifts and everything Jesus Christ.

412
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:54,510
USA.

413
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:57,690
USA.

414
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:58,570
Cideo Kojima.

415
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:01,750
Oh, yeah.

416
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:07,690
Oh, I'm younger.

417
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:10,290
John Metal Gear is younger now.

418
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:14,170
No, I think this was like five days ago.

419
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,550
No, see, my hair is black now.

420
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:18,770
It was before, too.

421
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:21,730
No, I had like a little bit of white hair from the stress.

422
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,010
You know, don't get cocky.

423
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:23,730
This isn't betraying you.

424
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:24,470
No, I don't think so.

425
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:25,270
Right.

426
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,990
So what exactly is this wonderful?

427
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,090
He doesn't keep stressed.

428
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,830
Oh, because he's snake.

429
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,850
He's, no, it's because he's a robot.

430
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:35,550
He's Metal Gear.

431
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,930
Oh, that's why he's Metal Gear?

432
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:39,850
Yes.

433
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:42,350
He has Metal Gear's inside of.

434
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:43,510
Yeah, yeah.

435
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,910
Oh, so he's like an android.

436
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:47,070
Wait, is he an android or a robot?

437
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:48,330
Both?

438
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:51,370
Both?

439
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:53,830
And the East's foremost expert on weapons development.

440
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:59,610
Oh my god, wait, I want to say Sokolov and his ugly wife.

441
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:02,550
Wait, why is his wife ugly?

442
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,070
How do you know his wife is ugly?

443
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:06,570
Because I've seen a picture of her.

444
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,070
The earth was blue.

445
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:09,850
We're just jealous that you're not his wife.

446
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:11,250
Well spoken.

447
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:12,170
I don't think so.

448
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:16,970
The rocket that carried Yuri Gagarin from orbit is the A1
known as the Vostok.

449
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:25,830
rocket man sokolov is said to be the man most responsible
for the multi-engine cluster used in so okay sokolov after

450
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:34,510
yeah held captive he made he's like a rocket scientist that
has been taken hostage by the russians from a lowly

451
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:40,930
technician to head of a design okay that's quite a success
that's and your job is to go get that guy it seems okay but

452
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:50,030
is he a good person or a bad person afraid yes You're gonna
ask that about literally everyone and I'll give you the same

453
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:53,550
answer to literally every single character.

454
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,790
It's just a gap.

455
00:27:56,110 --> 00:28:02,330
You get the family out first and succeeded in sneaking
Sokolov over the Berlin Wall shortly afterwards.

456
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:06,970
I was the one who- Oh, the space off of real history!

457
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,830
The security on the eastern side.

458
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:09,250
Yeah.

459
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:10,390
Oh!

460
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:13,090
Wait, this is the Cold War!

461
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:15,890
One piece, but the whole ordeal- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

462
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,730
That's why people, okay.

463
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:22,030
Okay, it's like, which side is the good side?

464
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:23,530
Okay, I get it now.

465
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:27,790
Yeah.

466
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:34,690
This is actually, this is actually like a non-fiction game.

467
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:42,250
He just, I just heard after World War II, so I thought,
like, Kojima invented, like, a new warrior.

468
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,670
Okay, oh, my God, it's Kennedy.

469
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:45,130
Look at that, that's a real man.

470
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,290
That's a real guy.

471
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:52,390
I understand now.

472
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:55,670
Naval blockade to prevent further missile shipments from
reaching Cuba.

473
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,690
Based on a true story.

474
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:58,230
Oh, my God.

475
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,330
Snake is real.

476
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:03,810
This is a game based off of...

477
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:05,790
Yeah, he interviewed a real man.

478
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,110
The Soviet forces went on alert.

479
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,510
There's a documentary, guys.

480
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,950
Melgear's a documentary.

481
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,610
Melgear's a documentary.

482
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,250
Oh, God.

483
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:15,730
That's a terrifying...

484
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:16,690
You played Rising.

485
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,910
This is a really terrifying thought.

486
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:22,470
The Soviet Union agreed to remove its missiles from Cuba.

487
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:25,530
And so the world avoided a nuclear holocaust.

488
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:30,990
But in order to get the Soviets to pull their missiles out,
we had to make a deal.

489
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:35,330
You mean the one where the US agreed to remove its IRBMs
from Turkey?

490
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:36,590
No.

491
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,010
Are you excited to play the game?

492
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:39,990
The Jupiter IRBMs deployed in Turkey were obsolete.

493
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:41,230
Eventually, right?

494
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:43,010
I will eventually be able to play, right?

495
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:45,210
You have like 20 more minutes.

496
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:45,710
Okay.

497
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:51,370
I'm just thinking like, okay, I just feel like that the
cutscenes are going to be locked.

498
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:56,330
I feel like I'm having a history lesson right now.

499
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:59,110
It's like a lot of info dump.

500
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:01,370
But eventually, like, it makes sense.

501
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:05,870
It's just when the first time you play this game, you're
like, what the hell are they talking about?

502
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:07,850
What the hell was he working on?

503
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,350
Yeah, what was he working on?

504
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:10,790
At the time, we had no idea.

505
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,030
Look at those blueprints.

506
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,690
We were running out of time.

507
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:16,830
I think it's either give up Sokolov or...

508
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:20,470
We take these blueprints and make a real thing and make it
real.

509
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,030
Yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly.

510
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:23,330
Write it down, guys.

511
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:24,150
Write it down.

512
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,230
We'll rebuild it.

513
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:27,110
The next day, I think we're a little late.

514
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:30,630
Added him over to agents on the eastern side.

515
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:32,270
Oh my god, he shot him.

516
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:33,430
I'm screaming, save me.

517
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,170
Save me.

518
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:40,010
Why did no one save him?

519
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:42,950
We received some new information on one of our moles.

520
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:46,710
Just because he's a nerd doesn't mean they don't have
rights.

521
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:52,070
He was taken back to the research facility and forced to
continue working on the weapon in question.

522
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:57,290
Nines do not have rights back then.

523
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:58,910
You're right.

524
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:01,330
There were lockers back then.

525
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:04,430
There were lockers.

526
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:06,890
Yeah, the...

527
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:08,390
And jocks that played football.

528
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:12,430
Yeah, the crew nerds, they have it real good.

529
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:15,010
Lockers are too small to stuff them now.

530
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:22,270
to do with the weapon i assume we're talking about a secret
weapon so big that khrushchev was ready to pull out of cuba

531
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:35,270
to get it back he's sokolov still in a facility no according
to our intelligence he's in selino yask a place oh for the

532
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:48,690

has a wife unfortunately yes But it's our best chance to get

533
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:55,750
him back This mission would never have been possible If he
was still in the research facility This is our last chance

534
00:31:55,750 --> 00:32:03,810

539
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:56,730
This is Ace Combat, right?

540
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:01,830
I've never played Ace Combat before, but I've literally
played Ace Combat right now.

541
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:07,110
The famous game, Ace Combat, where famously you jump out of
the plane and you don't play.

542
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:08,870
You don't pilot it.

543
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:18,950
It involves planes and I jumped out of a plane.

not talking yeah she can't speak she has clothes she can't

546
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:48,930

547
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:58,810
even with the fuel in the reserve tank we're facing a four
hour time limit if all goes well it shouldn't take more than

548
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:08,130
a few hours home in time for dinner but if anything goes
wrong you'll be eating dinner breakfast and all the rest of

And stupid.

555
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,140
He's Metal Gear Snake.

556
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,060
Oh, that's why it's called Solid.

557
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,500
Because it starts with an S.

558
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,740
And his name is Snake.

559
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:17,640
Hi.

00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,420
Oh, he's so fucking cool.

564
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,820
Yeah, Snake.

565
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,300
Oh, his middle name is Dave.

566
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,360

567
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:38,320
Wait, actually, like, yes, but also...

568
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,380
Oh my god, Snake David.

569
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,710
Okay, are you ready to play the game?

570
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:54,590
Yeah, I'm ready.

571
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:57,190
You have, like, another 10 minutes.

572
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:02,310
Oh my god, I am Nick.

573
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:06,220
I can sell to you!

574
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,060
Snake.

575
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:08,760
You don't like snakes?

576
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,160
What do you mean?

577
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,200
You've eaten one before, haven't you?

578
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,500
In survival training.

579
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,020
Wait, but what does a naked mean?

580
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,100
I'm glad to hear that.

581
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,380
Like, why can't I just be snake?

582
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,720
Well, you have nothing on you.

583
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,220
You're naked.

584
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,800
You have to get all your stuff, like...

585
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,660
What should I call you?

586
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,900
You have to get all your weapons and everything.

587
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:26,340
Uh-huh.

588
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:27,560
I'll be Tom.

589
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,940
Why does he get to be Tom?

590
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,260
This will be...

591
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,540
Because he's British!

592
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,560
Like, I have to be...

593
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,980
Who's snake then?

594
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,500
If I'm naked snake, there has to be an alpha snake.

595
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,020
Snake prime.

596
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,780
No, it's like there has to be...

597
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,620
I'm flying alpha snake.

598
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,580
Because there's snake prime.

599
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,220
Because why do I have two codes?

600
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,840
Like, why does it have to be naked if I can't just be snake?

601
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,580
He's Major Tom and your naked snake.

602
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,580
Yeah, but the major is his fucking rank.

603
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,120
Naked's not my rank.

604
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:05,640
Okay,

605
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,580
I only have a knife and a tranquilizer gun.

606
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,500
Why didn't you get me a real gun?

607
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,140
Yeah, about the backpack.

608
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,460
Oh, I lost it in a tree on the way down.

609
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,500
That's not good.

610
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:20,840
I see.

611
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,060
Well, you better go back and get it.

612
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:23,640
Oh, you get it.

613
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,320
Yeah.

614
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,400
No problem.

615
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,860
I can see it from here.

616
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,600
It's stuck on a branch.

617
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:31,700
Yeah.

618
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,260
Oh, I can climb.

619
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,620
Stand in front of a tree.

620
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,100
Sometimes.

621
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,900
Yeah, it's gotta have an IV on it.

622
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,780
I'll be monitoring your progress over the radio.

623
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,720
We can't risk violating Soviet airspace, but I'll be in the
gunship.

624
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:49,080
My frequency is 140.85.

625
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,420
I'll give you a call if I need to talk to you.

626
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,860
You have to memorize that, by the way.

627
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:59,540
What do you mean I have to memorize all their codecs?

628
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:00,220
What?

629
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,520
Is there not a list I can pick?

630
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,960
Where the fuck is my cell phone?

631
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,540
Okay, where's my, like, contact list?

632
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,080
No, there's no way.

633
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,240
Okay, give me a sec.

634
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,340
How do I call people?

635
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:12,380
How do I...

636
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,460

your presence no weapons equipment footprints sweat or
bodily waste the same goes for bullets and cartridges too

oh okay techniques sure but what about how to think like a

737
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:59,520
soldier how to think like a soldier I can't teach you that a
soldier needs to be strong in spirit body and technique and

738
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:06,640
the only thing you can learn from someone she's so cool in
fact technique doesn't even matter what's most important is

739
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:15,180
spirit spirit and body are like two sides of a single coin
they're the same thing i can't recognize her voice no who is

Oh my God.

742
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,100
And politics determine who you face on the battlefield.

743
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,920
And politics are a living thing.

744
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,100
She can, like, just not be Southerd?

745
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:41,560
Yeah, this is like her actual speaking voice.

746
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:42,260
It's so good.

747
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:46,660
Worst actors are so good at their jobs.

748
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:51,880
A soldier has to follow whatever orders he's given.

749
00:47:52,040 --> 00:48:01,860
It's not his place to question why but you're oh I was
thinking about sandy Oh, I think I was like Pros the whale.

00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:17,500
I forgot I was like sandy southern I got them confused You
guys she's a little confused I have the spirit you see

751
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:22,840

752
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,280
She said spirit's the most important thing, and I have the
spirit.

753
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:27,140
Same thing.

754
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,320
Sooner or later, your conscience is going to bother you.

755
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:36,460
In the end, you have to choose whether you're going to live
as a soldier or just another man with a gun.

756
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,460
There's a saying in the Orient.

757
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:40,200
Loyalty to the end.

758
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:41,840
Do you know what it means?

759
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:43,740
Being patriotic.

760
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:46,420
It means devoting yourself to your country.

761
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,680
Ooh, USA.

762
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:48,760
USA.

763
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:49,480
USA.

764
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:50,600
USA.

765
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:56,040
I wish I was soundboard just so I can do the ego screech.

766
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:15,850
I have the spirit of a mirror running me.

767
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:19,150
You guys just too close to the border.

768
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:26,130
As long as we have loyalty to the end.

769
00:49:26,190 --> 00:49:34,070
there's no point in believing in anything even in those we
love and that's the way a soldier's supposed to think the

770
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:42,610
only thing we can believe in with absolute certainty is the
mission Jack all right yeah his name's also Jack what is it

771
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:53,330
wait my name's John Jack snake David Hater yeah the
legendary unit that the boss put together during World War

772
00:49:53,330 --> 00:49:59,370
two was a snake the Cobra unit a group of heroes that
brought the war to an end and saved the world.

773
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:02,650
As long as you've got a legendary hero backing you up,
you'll be fine.

774
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:03,770
Isn't that right, Snake?

775
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:05,070
Yeah.

776
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:07,550
Oh my god, wait, the boss docks to me!

777
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:09,410

779
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:12,630
It's good to hear you.

780
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:13,410
I think he knows.

781
00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:15,350
Well, but paramedic!

782
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:17,030
She's in the frequency too!

783
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:19,130
She just docks me!

784
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:21,950
She's looking up your address right now.

785
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:26,030
She has my social security number now.

786
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:27,790
She already got it.

787
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:31,490
She's already opened up five credit cards.

788
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:33,410
CQC.

789
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:35,010
Close quarters combat, huh?

790
00:50:35,650 --> 00:50:37,850
I've been in three braids for the past four years.

791
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:39,270
I'm probably pretty rusty.

792
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:40,730
CQC.

793
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:42,370
Remember the basics of CQC.

794
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:43,550
CQC.

795
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:45,150
What does CQC stand for?

796
00:50:45,770 --> 00:50:47,070
Close quarters combat.

797
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:48,090
He already just says that.

798
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:49,510
Oh my god, pay attention.

799
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:51,230
Damn, there's so much.

800
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:54,950
They're like fucking Lord dumping me for 20 minutes
straight.

00:50:55,450 --> 00:50:56,170

You got your backpacks.

810
00:51:58,770 --> 00:52:01,470
The heavier the weapon, the faster you'll burn stamina.

811
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:04,490
Okay, so...

812
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:05,190

Oh, there's the pill!

818
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:14,810

819
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:15,350

How do I smoke it?

828
00:52:29,530 --> 00:52:30,950

But how do I smoke it?

830
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:33,710
You have to equip them.

831
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:35,490
Like, these are all in your backpack.

832
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:37,270
Yeah, that's how you equip stuff.

Oh, four, three.

845
00:53:03,950 --> 00:53:05,970

you see.

846
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:08,710
Okay.

00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:28,020
But you have it equipped.

925
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:29,400
It's with your gun.

926
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:29,880

What's the button?

936
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,340

937
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:49,500
But what's the button?

938
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:50,320
I can't...

939
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:53,340
I don't remember what it is in this game.

940
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:53,700
Okay.

941
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:56,380
Is it right trigger or...

942
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,480
No, no.

943
00:57:57,820 --> 00:58:00,600
No, that's the mask button.

944
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:01,920
Is it RB?

945
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:02,740
I can't remember.

946
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:04,000
No, it's not RB.

947
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:06,600
The RB is literally me in my mask.

948
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:07,880
Is it the D-pad?

949
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:08,680
Is it the D-pad?

950
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:09,760
Oh, okay.

951
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:12,240
No.

952
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:14,140
Oh my gosh, I can't remember what it is in this game.

953
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:15,580
Oh, hey, okay, okay.

954
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:16,120

956
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:17,200

Okay, now ready it and then.

959
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:21,400

960
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:23,700

00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:25,580
Oh.

964
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:29,200
I'm not tripping.

965
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:30,180
Okay.

966
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,900
I don't think I'm allowed to do it.

967
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:35,840
I don't think I'm allowed to stab the snake.

968
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:36,700
I think he's like...

969
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:37,120
You can.

970
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:37,800
It's allowed.

971
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:38,780
It's encouraged.

972
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:41,520
Oh, there you go.

973
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:42,020

974
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:42,460
You have to aim.

975
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:43,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

976
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:43,900

You got him.

982
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:50,860
I got it.

983
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:53,880
Oh, and I can eat it.

984
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:54,680
Oh.

985
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:55,580

986
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:56,260
Oh my god.

987
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,160
He shot the goat.

988
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,840
He doesn't feel so good no more.

989
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:01,300
He shot the goat.

990
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,200
He shot the goat.

991
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:04,500
He shot the goat.

992
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:08,200
Not the goat.

993
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:10,340
Oh, I can tranquilize them.

994
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:12,120
What can I do when they're tranquilized?

995
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:13,120
When they're alive.

996
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:18,960
Okay, so you can tranquilize like snakes and then throw it
at the guards and they get scared.

997
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,140
Oh, that's so cool.

You ever heard of Godzilla King of Monsters?

1006
01:00:01,850 --> 01:00:03,250
No, what is it?

1007
01:00:03,730 --> 01:00:04,430
It's a movie.

1009
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:06,390
Nope.

1010
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:13,090
It's about this monster called Godzilla who grows to an
enormous size in a nuclear test and goes on a rampage in

1011
01:00:13,090 --> 01:00:13,570
Tokyo.

1012
01:00:14,470 --> 01:00:15,250
Nuclear test, huh?

1013
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:19,250
Then the Marshall Islands must be crawling with giant
monsters right about now.

1014
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:20,990
It's just make-believe.

1015
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:23,410
Maybe that's why my pants have been so tight.

1016
01:00:24,010 --> 01:00:25,190

path it was originally a japanese movie but they made an

1019
01:00:47,350 --> 01:00:54,390

japanese one if you ever get the chance it's mostly mindless

1020
01:00:54,390 --> 01:01:01,010
fun but it's like is this snake That's good.

1021
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:03,990
You don't have to go to Japan.

1022
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:04,830
Whoa.

1023
01:01:05,190 --> 01:01:07,350
In 40 years, you might be able to see it in America too.

1024
01:01:07,770 --> 01:01:10,950
It might even win awards all across the globe in 60 years.

1025
01:01:11,410 --> 01:01:11,930

different perspective when you get in a jam.

You're far from okay.

1124
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:35,280
Look at your life gauge.

1125
01:07:35,580 --> 01:07:36,620
No, I got this.

1126
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:37,080

01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:41,420

Well, there is none, I don't think.

What the fuck?

1142
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:54,460
I feel like crocodiles are much more dangerous than hornets.

1143
01:08:55,940 --> 01:09:00,400
No, I don't think crocodiles produce juice, but bugs produce
juice.

1144
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:01,240
Okay.

1145
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:02,900

He's weak.

1152
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:11,980
He's weak.

1153
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:12,360
You're right.

1154
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:12,660
He's weak.

1155
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:13,220
You got him.

1156
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:13,840
You got him.

You're also pretty weak.

1161
01:09:16,860 --> 01:09:18,700
I mean, it says 85%.

1162
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:19,700
Oh, wait, that's my stamina.

1163
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:20,560
That's your...

1164
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:21,760
No, that's your camouflage.

1165
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:23,180
Oh, that's my camouflage?

1166
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:24,300
Okay, we'll eat this.

1167
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:25,100
Yeah.

1168
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:26,780

Yeah, I should heal.

1173
01:09:32,020 --> 01:09:33,700
That'll heal you faster.

1174
01:09:34,020 --> 01:09:34,300
Yeah.

1175
01:09:35,020 --> 01:09:35,920
Still pretty slow.

1176
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,820
I think I can get one more stab in.

1177
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:39,220
I think so.

1178
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:39,680

He doesn't care about his legs.

01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:44,620
He's weak.

1209
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:45,900
He can't fight back.

1210
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:46,540
He's weak.

1211
01:10:46,860 --> 01:10:47,020
He's weak.

1212
01:10:47,380 --> 01:10:48,060
Look at him.

01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:53,700
Look, he's screaming in agony.

1217
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:55,760
His mouth wide open.

1218
01:10:56,260 --> 01:10:56,360
Yeah.

1219
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:59,920
No one can hear you scream in the forest.

01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:01,020
Yeah.

1221
01:11:01,940 --> 01:11:02,960
He's standlocked.

1226
01:11:16,090 --> 01:11:16,850
Wait, is that the means?

1227
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:17,670
Oh, okay.

1228
01:11:17,910 --> 01:11:18,810
So now I can eat.

1253
01:11:56,970 --> 01:11:57,550
Oh, my God.

1254
01:11:58,730 --> 01:11:59,370
Is that choice?

1255
01:11:59,450 --> 01:11:59,810
Yes.

raise of the sun them you know when they look at me they get

1268
01:13:14,330 --> 01:13:22,230
blinded by the gold oh that'd be so good I'm like Edward
Colin in Twilight where he sparkles in the Sun

1269
01:13:29,510 --> 01:13:38,710
wait my mask didn't show oh it's probably oh I think it's a
setting you have to enable oh my god look at him though

1270
01:13:42,510 --> 01:13:44,050
I look so cool.

1271
01:13:44,690 --> 01:13:45,190

1272
01:13:47,010 --> 01:13:48,210
Yeah, get that guy's ass.

1273
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:49,350
Get that guy's ass.

1274
01:13:49,490 --> 01:13:50,110
Get the rasses.

1275
01:13:50,110 --> 01:13:51,130
I swear to enemy soldiers.

1276
01:13:52,090 --> 01:13:54,770
They're probably KGB troops sent to guard Sokolov.

1277
01:13:57,010 --> 01:13:59,330
AK-47s and grenades.

1278
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:04,680
He looks so cool.

1279
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:05,260
Yeah.

1280
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:06,840
Oh my god, he's even shiny.

1281
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:14,180
Like, there's like, those like statue people outside that
pretend to be like chrome statues.

1282
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:20,880
contact with the enemy is strictly prohibited don't engage
them in battle like the people in new york yeah yeah yeah

1283
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:27,700
you have to give them like give them like five dollars for
them to move yeah yeah yeah through the jungle without being

1284
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:39,340
seen oh that's a bit hard yeah this is like a stealth game
just by the way and then you can go to gold you can go to

1285
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:46,820
gold oh while the face option lets you change your face
paint Choosing camouflage that blends in with your

1286
01:14:46,820 --> 01:14:49,920
surroundings will help you conceal yourself more
effectively.

1287
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:54,780
Also, don't forget that anything that moves will stand out
in the jungle.

1288
01:14:55,580 --> 01:14:57,620
Like, he just stands up and does a loop-a-loop.

1289
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:03,760
But if you crawl instead, you should be able to sneak by
without being noticed.

1290
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:08,460
You can see how effective your camouflage is by letting you
get the camo in.

1291
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:09,980
Um, you know.

1292
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:13,120
The camo index shows how well your current camouflage blends
in.

1293
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:23,060
the higher the value oh yeah oh yeah every time every time
okay even though if i have minus 100 stealth it'll be fine

1294
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:30,060
right they are literally gonna be blinded by that's true
that's true i'll be like a blind spot it would be like don't

1295
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:38,140
worry about it all right or you could shoot them that's cool
too oh okay all right or you can hold them up and make them

1296
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:45,760
wiggle oh i like that wiggle part okay how do i make it so
my masks will show Uh, probably.

1297
01:15:47,820 --> 01:15:49,820
Oh, show headgear during cutscenes.

1298
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:50,280
Oh, nice.

1299
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:51,040
I like that.

1300
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:54,340
Okay, wait, why is there a huge warning sign?

1301
01:15:55,380 --> 01:15:58,740
Oh, I think it's because, like, yeah, you're immersion.

1302
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:00,920
I don't know what they're talking about.

1303
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:02,140
I'm very immersed right now.

1304
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:04,040
I know if I'm wearing it, I want to see it.

1305
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:04,820
Yeah, exactly.

1306
01:16:05,220 --> 01:16:06,460
Oh, I think someone just saw you.

1307
01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:07,980
No, it's fine.

1308
01:16:09,820 --> 01:16:10,820
They might shoot you.

1309
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:12,020
Oh, they missed.

1310
01:16:14,580 --> 01:16:16,040
Oh shit, it hit me!

1311
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:16,580
Oh shit!

1312
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:18,560
Oh shit, oh shit!

1313
01:16:19,020 --> 01:16:19,460
Give me a sec!

1314
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:20,700
Give me a sec!

1315
01:16:20,860 --> 01:16:21,860
I don't have any equip!

1316
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:24,580
You could equip it like right now.

1317
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:25,280
Okay, wait, wait.

1318
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:27,080
I'll reset them.

1319
01:16:27,140 --> 01:16:27,480
Don't worry.

1320
01:16:27,740 --> 01:16:28,240
I got this.

1321
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:28,680
Watch this.

1322
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:30,500
Well, I don't know if they'll follow you.

1323
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:30,940
Watch this.

1324
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:31,320
Oh, wait.

1325
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:31,800
Nice.

1326
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:33,160
Oh, I was going to reset the whole thing.

1327
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:34,840
It's like I just played the game again.

1328
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:37,140
Yeah, there you go.

1329
01:16:37,780 --> 01:16:38,100
Alright.

1330
01:16:41,380 --> 01:16:42,200
I don't understand.

1331
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:43,320
Why was he not flashbang?

1332
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:56,080
He probably might be used to it In the forest Yeah yeah Okay
Or he's wearing sunglasses Don't worry I'm first person Oh

1333
01:16:56,080 --> 01:17:11,050
the red is like totally ruining your goal Oh my god I know
It's so bad Wait oh my god Wait I can Roll over snake Roll

1334
01:17:11,050 --> 01:17:12,970
over Roll over Oh

1335
01:17:23,260 --> 01:17:24,820
You know you could do that?

1336
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:29,580
All you're doing is rolling very slow.

1337
01:17:30,860 --> 01:17:32,520
Slow motion roll.

1338
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:34,100
Slow motion roll.

1339
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,080
It's the immersion.

1340
01:17:36,340 --> 01:17:37,360
This is the immersion.

1341
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:39,020
I don't understand how he saw me.

1342
01:17:39,820 --> 01:17:42,320
I was in the tall grass like they told me.

1343
01:17:42,580 --> 01:17:43,660
I think because you're...

1344
01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:44,620
What the fuck?

1345
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:47,320
I think because you're at negative 100.

1346
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:48,380
There's no way.

1347
01:17:48,420 --> 01:17:48,940
Okay, it's fine.

1348
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:49,480
We're here.

1349
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:50,300
All right.

1350
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:52,200
You could shoot them too.

1351
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:53,460
Yeah, shoot them.

1352
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:54,520
Can you walk the way?

1353
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:57,360
Oh, they're going to bring more people.

1354
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:58,140
Oh.

1355
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,120
Don't worry, I'll reset it.

1356
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:04,540
No.

1357
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:06,040
No word.

1358
01:18:06,540 --> 01:18:07,060
No word.

1359
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:07,940
False alarm.

1360
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:08,920
Okay.

1361
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:09,560
Okay.

1362
01:18:09,940 --> 01:18:10,240
Okay.

1363
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:11,060
Test, take three.

1364
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:11,440
Take three.

1365
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,960
I might have to take off the gold.

1366
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:15,160
But, okay.

1367
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:17,240
What if, oh, naked woodland.

1368
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:18,440
What does that look like?

1369
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:20,080
Yeah.

1370
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:20,720
Whoa.

1371
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:21,660
Okay, I think...

1372
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:22,060
Yeah.

1373
01:18:22,060 --> 01:18:24,340
This one has like a giant.

1374
01:18:25,220 --> 01:18:28,040
You bought the gold and you're not going to wear it.

1375
01:18:28,060 --> 01:18:28,820
Like, what a waste of money.

1376
01:18:28,820 --> 01:18:31,120
Okay, but like, I will.

1377
01:18:31,220 --> 01:18:32,540
I'll wear it after this.

1378
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:33,460
Okay.

1379
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:34,360
All right, wait.

1380
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:37,780
Okay, and then I feel like the frog is the best for it.

1381
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:41,440
The frog, yeah, I can touch it.

1382
01:18:41,660 --> 01:18:42,080
There we go.

1383
01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:50,360
So those, the frog mask and the duck mask in every area,
like every map, there's a hidden frog and then hidden duck.

1384
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:50,860
Oh.

1385
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:52,920
That's cool.

1386
01:18:53,220 --> 01:18:54,440
All right, so where are they?

1387
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:55,940
I don't know.

1388
01:18:56,120 --> 01:18:56,680
Use your eyes.

1389
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:01,880
Stand tall.

1390
01:19:02,260 --> 01:19:02,520
Stand tall.

1391
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:04,480
You see, I see there's a little hole at the top.

1392
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:05,060
I know.

1393
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:06,060
I'm looking through it.

1394
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:07,160
I'm looking through it.

1395
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:09,840
Up a little higher.

1396
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:12,520
We'll be able to see it soon.

1397
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:13,660
Oh, my God.

1398
01:19:13,780 --> 01:19:14,920
They saw me from that.

1399
01:19:15,180 --> 01:19:15,640
Oh, my God.

1400
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:16,580
Oh, my God.

1401
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:17,280
Oh, my God.

1402
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:19,320
Okay, shoot him.

1403
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:19,700
Shoot him.

1404
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:23,800
Shoot him!

1405
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:25,700
I'm trying to find him!

1406
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:27,600
Wait, wait, wait!

1407
01:19:30,420 --> 01:19:31,740
You see him?

1408
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:33,600
You see him?

1409
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:36,040
Oh, yes, yes.

1410
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:36,640
Right here?

1411
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:36,940
Right there?

1412
01:19:37,460 --> 01:19:37,580
Yeah.

1413
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:40,420
You think I got him?

1414
01:19:40,940 --> 01:19:41,380
Wait, wait.

1415
01:19:42,220 --> 01:19:43,240
I think he... Oh.

1416
01:19:44,060 --> 01:19:45,200
Wait, did that actually?

1417
01:19:48,060 --> 01:19:49,180
I got him!

1418
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:49,860
I got him!

1419
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:51,540
First try!

1420
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:54,820
Okay, so your trank does run out, by the way.

1421
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:55,420
Oh, okay.

1422
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:56,860
Or not the trank, sorry.

1423
01:19:57,140 --> 01:19:57,900
Your suppressor.

1424
01:19:57,980 --> 01:19:58,860
Your suppressor does run out.

1425
01:19:58,880 --> 01:19:59,340
Okay, okay.

1426
01:19:59,820 --> 01:20:00,460
First try.

1427
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:02,280
How do I drag this guy?

1428
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:06,640
Uh, you gotta stand up.

1429
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:08,860
You gotta, like, not be clipping into his bud.

1430
01:20:09,140 --> 01:20:10,720
Okay, what if I just stab him?

1431
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:12,900
Oh, yeah, you could kill him.

1432
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:13,560
You can do that.

1433
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:13,920
Okay.

1434
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:17,440
Keep going.

1435
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:19,160
Keep going.

1436
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:19,520
Alright.

1437
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:22,980
Okay, that's just a strong-ass tranquilizer.

1438
01:20:24,180 --> 01:20:24,660
Yeah.

1439
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:29,360
It's probably made for, like, blow or something.

1440
01:20:29,740 --> 01:20:29,760
There we go.

1441
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:30,340
We did it.

1442
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:31,940
All right.

1443
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:34,520
Now you gotta hide the body.

1444
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:36,240
Don't forget there's another guy.

1445
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:37,420
I don't think he saw me.

1446
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:38,500
Oh, hey.

1447
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:40,840
Nice.

1448
01:20:41,660 --> 01:20:42,520
Oh, nice.

1449
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:43,720
How do I take him?

1450
01:20:45,020 --> 01:20:47,220
You just pick him up and drag him away.

1451
01:20:47,740 --> 01:20:49,180
Can I bring him to the crocodiles?

1452
01:20:50,580 --> 01:20:52,580
I think you'll drop him before you do that.

1453
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:53,620
Yeah.

1454
01:20:53,720 --> 01:21:07,060
that's unlucky but you could put him in the grass oh it's
kind of peaceful there yeah he's one with nature all right

1455
01:21:07,060 --> 01:21:15,880
okay so the only problem with the frog mask is that it might
be hard to aim with it maybe i'm not that i don't know i

1456
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:26,040
don't i i'm not that sure yet but it might be a little Yeah,
it's a bit hard to tell because there is a hole on the top.

1457
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:27,240
There is a hole on the top.

1458
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:28,260
Yeah.

1459
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:32,640
It's like, it's like, yeah, part of it makes it easier and
part of it makes it a little more difficult.

1460
01:21:32,860 --> 01:21:33,000
Yeah.

1461
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:36,680
I say it's on the easier side, but I'm a trained player.

1462
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:39,500
So yeah, yeah.

1463
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:40,200
I get it.

1464
01:21:40,260 --> 01:21:40,820
I get that.

1465
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:41,320
Yeah.

1466
01:21:41,580 --> 01:21:42,620
Oh, I can grab him.

1467
01:21:42,860 --> 01:21:43,520
Wait, where is he?

1468
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:45,220
Oh, that's your CQC.

1469
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:46,680
There he is.

1470
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:47,000
There he is.

1471
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:48,260
I'm going to try grabbing him.

1472
01:21:48,260 --> 01:21:50,900
Do I have to be not prone to grab him or no?

1473
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:52,660
You have to be not prone.

1474
01:21:52,940 --> 01:21:57,360
Oh my god, but if I stand up, he'll see me Yeah, that's the
stealthy part.

1475
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:58,780
Yeah, I got this

1476
01:22:03,550 --> 01:22:04,570

Oh, yeah, no sneak up behind him Oh Wait, what the okay.

1481
01:22:18,330 --> 01:22:18,710
Oh shit.

1482
01:22:19,330 --> 01:22:24,330

Is he dead?

1488
01:22:58,270 --> 01:22:59,110
Oh, yeah, he's definitely dead.

1489
01:22:59,210 --> 01:23:00,970
I've been stabbing for way too long.

1490
01:23:03,710 --> 01:23:05,230
I thought he'd disappear.

1491
01:23:06,150 --> 01:23:06,310
Okay.

1492
01:23:07,190 --> 01:23:09,450
It's like if snake were sensitive to blood.

1493
01:23:11,370 --> 01:23:11,850
All right.

1494
01:23:12,190 --> 01:23:13,370
You keep going, keep going.

1495
01:23:13,430 --> 01:23:13,810
There you go.

1496
01:23:13,990 --> 01:23:14,790
Keep going till there is.

1497
01:23:14,930 --> 01:23:15,310

There it is.

1499
01:23:15,830 --> 01:23:17,170
It's good that he died.

1500
01:23:17,350 --> 01:23:18,130
Wait, where's the last guy?

1501
01:23:19,130 --> 01:23:20,230
You could just keep going.

1502
01:23:20,450 --> 01:23:21,350
You don't have to kill him.

1503
01:23:21,690 --> 01:23:24,030
They will respawn, by the way.

1504
01:23:24,410 --> 01:23:26,030
Like, no matter if you kill them or not.

1505
01:23:28,190 --> 01:23:29,670
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1506
01:23:29,670 --> 01:23:30,170

Oh, my God, you guys, her river is going to be nuts.

1510
01:23:37,810 --> 01:23:39,550
She's laughing, but she doesn't know what that means.

1511
01:23:43,590 --> 01:23:44,050
All right.

1512
01:23:45,330 --> 01:23:46,590
There's still one more guy.

1513
01:23:50,170 --> 01:23:51,110
Where is he?

1514
01:23:54,410 --> 01:23:55,730
Oh, no, I think you got him.

1515
01:23:55,750 --> 01:23:56,770
I got all of them?

1516
01:23:57,150 --> 01:23:57,730
I think so.

1517
01:23:57,750 --> 01:23:59,090
Oh, there was one more guy.

1518
01:23:59,670 --> 01:24:00,510
No, no, no.

1519
01:24:00,930 --> 01:24:03,270
I thought, oh, there's the frog!

1520
01:24:03,870 --> 01:24:05,910
Yeah, if you shoot him, he makes a noise.

1521
01:24:07,610 --> 01:24:08,410
Yeah, where's my...

1522
01:24:10,190 --> 01:24:11,350
Hold, hold it, yeah.

1523
01:24:11,590 --> 01:24:12,410
All right, there you go.

1524
01:24:14,030 --> 01:24:15,510
All right, now shoot him.

1525
01:24:17,930 --> 01:24:19,090
There's the tree in it.

1526
01:24:19,250 --> 01:24:19,450
Okay.

1527
01:24:20,190 --> 01:24:22,790
There is a tree in front of it.

1528
01:24:23,190 --> 01:24:24,190
Well, maybe move.

1529
01:24:25,250 --> 01:24:25,610
Oh!

1530
01:24:26,970 --> 01:24:27,330
Oh!

1531
01:24:27,910 --> 01:24:29,090
It's called keraton!

1532
01:24:29,930 --> 01:24:30,290
Yeah!

1533
01:24:30,890 --> 01:24:32,310
Wait, can I take him or no?

1534
01:24:32,890 --> 01:24:33,970
No, he's just there.

1535
01:24:34,050 --> 01:24:34,710
Oh, he's just there?

1536
01:24:35,370 --> 01:24:36,210
Yeah, he's just chilling.

1537
01:24:36,370 --> 01:24:37,610
All right, I gotta pee real quick.

1538
01:24:37,830 --> 01:24:38,310
Give me a sec.

1539
01:24:38,470 --> 01:24:38,650
I'm here.

1540
01:24:39,090 --> 01:24:39,450
All right.

1541
01:24:39,790 --> 01:24:40,510
Get me with him.

1542
01:24:40,530 --> 01:24:43,290
Okay, well, did you take care of that guy?

1543
01:24:43,470 --> 01:24:43,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1544
01:24:43,870 --> 01:24:44,610
I killed all of them.

1545
01:24:45,990 --> 01:24:47,110
Hey, I'll be right back.

1546
01:24:47,530 --> 01:24:47,870
Okay.

1547
01:24:53,110 --> 01:24:55,210

Okay, I don't understand.

1634
01:29:15,870 --> 01:29:17,710

How do I get them?

1653
01:30:16,330 --> 01:30:18,230
Uh, yeah, like that with your knife.

1654
01:30:18,570 --> 01:30:20,010
You can equip your knife.

1655
01:30:20,170 --> 01:30:20,450
Alright.

1656
01:30:21,510 --> 01:30:23,850
There must be a faster way to equip it.

1657
01:30:25,050 --> 01:30:25,270
Oh.

1658
01:30:25,790 --> 01:30:26,390
There you go.

1659
01:30:26,710 --> 01:30:27,030
Yeah!

Oh my ass.

01:30:35,590 --> 01:30:36,890
Alright, let's try the mushroom.

1665
01:30:37,470 --> 01:30:38,030
Yeah.

1666
01:30:38,710 --> 01:30:39,710
I shouldn't kill you.

1667
01:30:40,490 --> 01:30:41,130
Oh, nice.

1668
01:30:41,990 --> 01:30:42,990
Not so great.

1669
01:30:43,870 --> 01:30:45,750
Bakers can't be choosers, snake.

1670
01:30:45,930 --> 01:30:47,070
You're in the forest.

1671
01:30:48,810 --> 01:30:50,730
Well, he can still have an opinion.

1672
01:30:51,190 --> 01:30:51,450
No.

1673
01:30:53,630 --> 01:30:54,190
Wait.

1674
01:30:54,910 --> 01:30:55,850
Yeah, that way.

1675
01:30:56,110 --> 01:30:57,110
I heard number B's.

1676
01:31:00,190 --> 01:31:09,090

bees there's no way the other you forgot to get the other

1677
01:31:09,090 --> 01:31:19,110

will chase after me I'm so far away yeah yeah see it's fine

1678
01:31:19,110 --> 01:31:34,190
and then pillage them yeah okay let's go this way yeah Oh,
it's so annoying to swap between the two.

1679
01:31:35,270 --> 01:31:36,390
Yeah, more mushrooms.

1680
01:31:36,810 --> 01:31:37,590
More mushrooms.

What is this?

1685
01:31:45,890 --> 01:31:47,430
He just hates it.

1686
01:31:47,710 --> 01:31:48,710
You are causing it.

1687
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:52,510
On your right.

1688
01:31:57,070 --> 01:31:59,710
It's like those hikers passing each other.

01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,800
Your objective, Sokolov, is inside the factory.

1695
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:47,300
They should be holding him in a room in the northeast
section.

1696
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:48,580
Northeast section.

1697
01:32:48,940 --> 01:32:49,400
Got it.

1698
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:50,300
Be careful.

1699
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:52,840
Your mission is to bring- What happens if I kill him?

1700
01:32:53,540 --> 01:32:56,360
He must not be exposed to any kind of- I can't?

Make noise.

01:33:41,260 --> 01:33:42,520
Yeah, you can knock and stuff.

1713
01:33:45,810 --> 01:33:47,450
I don't think they hear me.

1714
01:33:47,730 --> 01:33:48,770
No, I don't think so.

1715
01:33:51,810 --> 01:33:52,270
Alright.

1716
01:33:53,090 --> 01:33:54,470
Just a win, I guess.

Oh, maybe if I'd make it against this wall.

1718
01:33:58,730 --> 01:33:59,850
They're kind of far, though.

1719
01:34:00,570 --> 01:34:01,010
Knock, knock.

1720
01:34:03,310 --> 01:34:04,450
They're letting you in.

1721
01:34:06,370 --> 01:34:08,150
Maybe there's no one in set.

1722
01:34:09,030 --> 01:34:09,910
It's a good beat.

1723
01:34:09,950 --> 01:34:15,390
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum,
bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

1724
01:34:15,390 --> 01:34:15,930
All right.

1725
01:34:16,150 --> 01:34:16,830
Maybe this one.

1726
01:34:17,990 --> 01:34:18,770
Wait, where is he?

1727
01:34:19,790 --> 01:34:20,990
They're all over.

1728
01:34:21,550 --> 01:34:22,050
Oh, right here.

1729
01:34:26,630 --> 01:34:27,550
Oh, my God.

1730
01:34:27,570 --> 01:34:28,890
They can't hear anything.

1731
01:34:30,130 --> 01:34:31,750
We're in a den for some shit.

1732
01:34:32,150 --> 01:34:32,630
Oh, wait, wait.

1733
01:34:32,810 --> 01:34:33,810
No, he's got his.

1734
01:34:33,870 --> 01:34:35,050
He got his earbuds in there.

1735
01:34:35,250 --> 01:34:36,570
Oh, he has his earbuds on.

1736
01:34:37,050 --> 01:34:38,230
That makes sense.

1737
01:34:38,370 --> 01:34:39,130
Yeah, yeah.

1738
01:34:39,990 --> 01:34:41,190
What do I do with this guy?

1739
01:34:41,930 --> 01:34:42,670
Kill him.

1740
01:34:44,250 --> 01:34:44,870
You didn't see him?

1741
01:34:44,910 --> 01:34:46,050
He's, oh, he saw me.

1742
01:34:49,290 --> 01:34:50,010
There you go.

1743
01:34:51,050 --> 01:34:52,390
Oh, I think he already called for backup.

1744
01:34:52,870 --> 01:34:53,050
Oh.

1745
01:34:53,890 --> 01:34:55,490
And now they're calling for more backup.

1746
01:34:56,610 --> 01:34:59,290
Yeah, it really sucks when they start radioing.

1747
01:34:59,570 --> 01:35:04,070
Okay, I, okay, I, okay, that's what do you mean?

1748
01:35:04,130 --> 01:35:04,530
Okay.

1749
01:35:06,670 --> 01:35:08,090
Yeah, um...

1750
01:35:08,090 --> 01:35:08,210
Oh!

1751
01:35:08,570 --> 01:35:08,790
Whoa.

1752
01:35:09,750 --> 01:35:11,110
Wait, how many people are here?

1753
01:35:12,850 --> 01:35:13,370
Uh...

1754
01:35:13,370 --> 01:35:14,610
Great question.

1755
01:35:15,110 --> 01:35:15,410
Wait.

1756
01:35:15,770 --> 01:35:16,210
Oh my god.

1757
01:35:16,270 --> 01:35:16,590
Oh, nice.

1758
01:35:16,650 --> 01:35:17,550
I have cutscene immunity.

1759
01:35:18,610 --> 01:35:18,990
Bro!

1760
01:35:19,270 --> 01:35:19,870
Oh, shit!

1761
01:35:20,450 --> 01:35:20,870
Nice.

1762
01:35:21,830 --> 01:35:22,510
It's okay.

1763
01:35:22,630 --> 01:35:25,570
Yeah, the game pauses, like, when you're, like, switching.

1764
01:35:26,690 --> 01:35:26,970
Bro!

1765
01:35:27,290 --> 01:35:27,930
Wait, where did he go?

1766
01:35:30,050 --> 01:35:31,130
That's where I got you!

1767
01:35:31,590 --> 01:35:32,210
Oh, shit.

1768
01:35:32,250 --> 01:35:32,870
Wait, he got me.

1769
01:35:34,830 --> 01:35:35,930
I got you.

1770
01:35:37,650 --> 01:35:38,530
Okay, wait, I...

1771
01:35:38,530 --> 01:35:39,390
Oh, I got a shotgun!

1772
01:35:39,590 --> 01:35:40,150
Oh, you got a shotgun!

1773
01:35:40,330 --> 01:35:41,130
Use that, use that!

1774
01:35:41,190 --> 01:35:43,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1775
01:35:43,830 --> 01:35:44,550
Where is it?

1776
01:35:44,990 --> 01:35:46,330
Oh, you gotta equip it for him.

1777
01:35:46,630 --> 01:35:47,170
God damn it.

1778
01:35:49,030 --> 01:35:49,390
Wrong.

1779
01:35:49,850 --> 01:35:50,430
Oh, my God.

1780
01:35:50,530 --> 01:35:50,870
I can't...

1781
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:51,530
Okay, there you go.

1782
01:35:51,770 --> 01:35:52,410
Yeah, there you go.

1783
01:35:52,510 --> 01:35:52,850
Okay, okay.

1784
01:35:53,590 --> 01:35:53,670
Uh...

1785
01:35:53,670 --> 01:35:55,010
The M-37.

1786
01:35:55,750 --> 01:35:56,010
Yeah.

1787
01:35:56,230 --> 01:35:57,650
Yeah, and then...

1788
01:35:57,650 --> 01:35:58,650
And then equip it.

1789
01:35:59,490 --> 01:35:59,850
Yep.

1790
01:36:00,170 --> 01:36:00,530
Yep.

1791
01:36:00,630 --> 01:36:01,910
Okay, now stand up and shoot.

1792
01:36:02,070 --> 01:36:03,330
Or you can just shoot one down.

1793
01:36:04,010 --> 01:36:04,770
Yeah, that's good.

1794
01:36:05,610 --> 01:36:06,170
There you go.

1795
01:36:06,810 --> 01:36:08,030
I think he's dead.

1796
01:36:08,290 --> 01:36:10,070
Yeah, and then your alert's going down, too.

1797
01:36:10,130 --> 01:36:10,830
They have no idea where you're at.

1798
01:36:10,830 --> 01:36:11,590
Yeah, they don't know.

1799
01:36:12,010 --> 01:36:13,010
They're stupid.

1800
01:36:13,210 --> 01:36:14,190
They're so dumb.

1801
01:36:14,450 --> 01:36:15,150
I know, right?

1802
01:36:17,530 --> 01:36:19,890
Okay, there's a lot of people now awake.

1803
01:36:21,370 --> 01:36:22,830
Oh, oh, oh, get his ass.

1804
01:36:23,070 --> 01:36:23,330
Yeah.

1805
01:36:25,230 --> 01:36:27,650
Oh, I think three guys were alerted.

1806
01:36:27,670 --> 01:36:28,030
It's okay.

1807
01:36:30,250 --> 01:36:31,310
Can't get me.

1808
01:36:32,250 --> 01:36:33,450
Can't see out there.

1809
01:36:37,210 --> 01:36:37,670
Okay.

1810
01:36:38,130 --> 01:36:40,050
You don't need to see me.

1811
01:36:40,550 --> 01:36:41,930
Yeah, it's so true.

1812
01:36:43,190 --> 01:36:45,350
Wait, he sees me from there?

1813
01:36:46,250 --> 01:36:47,170
Oh, no.

1814
01:36:47,770 --> 01:36:48,330
Just shoot him.

1815
01:36:48,430 --> 01:36:49,030
Yeah, just shoot.

1816
01:36:49,350 --> 01:36:50,730
Oh my god, that's a grenade.

1817
01:36:51,910 --> 01:36:53,370
Yeah, they're pretty hardcore sometimes.

1818
01:36:53,710 --> 01:36:55,850
Yeah, they don't know where I am.

1819
01:36:58,090 --> 01:36:58,810
They'll get worse.

1820
01:36:59,150 --> 01:37:00,870
Yeah, in the actual mission.

1821
01:37:01,750 --> 01:37:02,490
Yeah, I could...

1822
01:37:02,490 --> 01:37:03,090
It's like a sniper.

1823
01:37:03,250 --> 01:37:03,750
Watch this.

1824
01:37:04,170 --> 01:37:04,770
I see him.

1825
01:37:06,090 --> 01:37:06,690
Oh, wait.

1826
01:37:06,690 --> 01:37:07,290
He's still alive.

1827
01:37:07,410 --> 01:37:07,550
Oh my god.

1828
01:37:07,630 --> 01:37:08,190
He tanked that.

1829
01:37:08,210 --> 01:37:08,390
Yeah.

1830
01:37:08,390 --> 01:37:09,310
He tanked that.

1831
01:37:09,570 --> 01:37:09,570
Yeah.

1832
01:37:10,250 --> 01:37:11,090
Wait, blow those up.

1833
01:37:11,290 --> 01:37:12,910
Shoot the, shoot the barrel Oh, this bear?

1834
01:37:13,990 --> 01:37:14,770
Oh, shit!

1835
01:37:15,150 --> 01:37:15,530
Did I get him?

1836
01:37:16,230 --> 01:37:16,910
I think I got him.

1837
01:37:17,390 --> 01:37:18,290
Oh, I think so.

1838
01:37:18,790 --> 01:37:19,130
Oh, my God.

1839
01:37:19,230 --> 01:37:19,670
I did it.

1840
01:37:19,750 --> 01:37:20,470
The other guy out, too.

1841
01:37:20,930 --> 01:37:21,530
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

1842
01:37:21,670 --> 01:37:21,930
Oh, wait.

1843
01:37:22,130 --> 01:37:22,790
Wait, this guy's alive.

1844
01:37:22,910 --> 01:37:23,590
Okay, give me a sec.

1845
01:37:23,750 --> 01:37:23,930
That guy's alive.

1846
01:37:24,030 --> 01:37:24,350
Take him out.

1847
01:37:24,370 --> 01:37:24,670

Oh, where I got you.

I got this.

1852
01:37:28,270 --> 01:37:28,730
Actually, stab him.

1853
01:37:28,790 --> 01:37:29,050
Stab him.

1854
01:37:29,150 --> 01:37:29,850
Save the...

1855
01:37:29,850 --> 01:37:30,250
No, no, no.

1856
01:37:30,930 --> 01:37:31,270
Oh, okay.

1857
01:37:32,830 --> 01:37:33,850
Okay, I think he's dead.

1858
01:37:35,110 --> 01:37:38,310
You, like, I have to dramatically flail his arm.

1859
01:37:38,550 --> 01:37:40,950
Guys, I think I got him, guys.

1860
01:37:44,650 --> 01:37:45,450
No survivors.

1861
01:37:46,170 --> 01:37:48,150
I wanted to alert them, guys.

1862
01:37:48,610 --> 01:37:49,590
If I alerting...

1863
01:37:49,590 --> 01:37:50,430
Oh, I want to see you guys.

1864
01:37:50,550 --> 01:37:51,010
Oh, yeah, nice.

1865
01:37:51,870 --> 01:37:55,290
By alerting them, I get to kill more people.

1866
01:37:55,790 --> 01:37:56,730
Wait, he's just asleep.

1867
01:37:57,270 --> 01:37:58,130
How are you asleep?

1868
01:37:58,230 --> 01:37:59,650
I fucking shot you.

1869
01:38:01,810 --> 01:38:03,150
Um, are they still around?

1870
01:38:03,890 --> 01:38:04,630
I don't know.

1871
01:38:04,870 --> 01:38:06,110
I don't know how they're alive.

1872
01:38:06,150 --> 01:38:07,090
I shot them.

1873
01:38:08,610 --> 01:38:09,810
Well, they'll wake up eventually.

1874
01:38:09,910 --> 01:38:11,050
You could just go to Sokolov.

1875
01:38:12,390 --> 01:38:13,430
I just got him.

1876
01:38:14,230 --> 01:38:14,710

1877
01:38:17,010 --> 01:38:17,510
There we go.

1878
01:38:18,550 --> 01:38:18,990
Yeah.

1879
01:38:19,430 --> 01:38:19,690
Okay.

1880
01:38:20,150 --> 01:38:21,310
Do you have shotgun ammo?

1881
01:38:22,230 --> 01:38:22,590
No.

1882
01:38:23,050 --> 01:38:24,470
Do you have shotgun ammo?

1883
01:38:26,710 --> 01:38:28,430
I'm giving them pat down.

1884
01:38:29,110 --> 01:38:29,330

Oh, nice.

I don't know what that is.

1888
01:38:34,850 --> 01:38:36,990
That will disable like their comms.

1889
01:38:37,270 --> 01:38:37,710
Oh, wait.

01:39:54,310 --> 01:39:56,970
You're gonna find his body like that too.

1906
01:39:57,510 --> 01:39:57,730
Yeah.

1907
01:39:58,650 --> 01:40:02,610
And he's just gonna, his reputation will be tarnished
forever.

1908
01:40:02,910 --> 01:40:03,390
Hmm.

1909
01:40:10,300 --> 01:40:11,540
Oh, is that him?

1910
01:40:11,860 --> 01:40:12,440
Sokolov.

1911
01:40:13,020 --> 01:40:13,840
Yeah, sokolov.

1912
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:14,560
Sokolov.

1913
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:19,620
Look at that he's burning.

1914
01:40:20,020 --> 01:40:21,320
He's burning the paint blue!

1915
01:40:24,170 --> 01:40:25,990
America needs them!

1916
01:40:35,080 --> 01:40:36,900
He burned it all!

1917
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:38,520
He burned it all.

1918
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:42,680
That's so smart, because all the blue players is in his
head, so they have to keep him alive.

1919
01:40:44,120 --> 01:40:44,420
Yeah.

1920
01:40:46,180 --> 01:40:47,260
You're CIA.

Zero.

1924
01:40:50,920 --> 01:40:52,700
The man who got you out two years ago.

1925
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:55,740
Zero.

thunderbolt naked snake that's like his thing has been

1930
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:54,060
pursuing a policy of peaceful coexistence with the west
nothing bad ever happens to the kennedys because he's still

1931
01:41:54,060 --> 01:41:54,880
alive right

1932
01:41:58,160 --> 01:42:07,280
but the failure of his agricultural policies has put him in
a precarious position and on top of that the tragedy last

1933
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:24,880
November the president Kennedy's assassination oh yeah he's
dead but nothing bad ever happens to the Kennedys oh my god

1934
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:29,480
meant spoilers They just said it.

1935
01:42:31,800 --> 01:42:32,980
That's your guy.

1936
01:42:33,120 --> 01:42:34,260
That's our guy.

1937
01:42:34,300 --> 01:42:34,620
Oh.

1938
01:42:35,100 --> 01:42:35,600
Colonel Vulgan.

1939
01:42:36,120 --> 01:42:36,720
Thunderbolt.

1940
01:42:37,860 --> 01:42:38,120
Yeah.

1941
01:42:38,820 --> 01:42:39,760
Much like this one.

1942
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:46,300
OKB812 known as the Grunin Design Bureau and is using it to
further his plans.

1943
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:48,360
But he was alive and cloned high.

1944
01:42:49,540 --> 01:42:51,140
I think that was his clone.

1945
01:42:51,720 --> 01:42:53,060
No way.

1946
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:55,240
Is that what clone high is about?

1947
01:42:55,240 --> 01:42:59,440
Yeah, it's about like cloning historical figures and Putting
them in high school.

1948
01:43:00,260 --> 01:43:01,300
Oh, my God.

1949
01:43:01,740 --> 01:43:03,680
That's the whole point of Clown High.

1950
01:43:03,780 --> 01:43:04,940
They chose him?

1951
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:06,900
Is it because he couldn't object?

1952
01:43:07,740 --> 01:43:12,220
Because nothing bad ever happens to the Kennedys.

1953
01:43:18,080 --> 01:43:18,580
Exactly.

1954
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:23,240
They wouldn't need that many men just to keep me inside.

1955
01:43:24,640 --> 01:43:28,520
Their orders were to prevent Colonel Vulcan from capturing
me.

1956
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:35,280
Even if it meant killing me in the process.

1957
01:43:36,700 --> 01:43:38,500
That's not capturing.

1958
01:43:44,170 --> 01:43:45,010
Vulcan will come.

1959
01:43:45,350 --> 01:43:48,290
I'm sure that you must get me out of here before then.

1960
01:43:50,070 --> 01:43:50,670
Leave it to me.

1961
01:43:51,010 --> 01:43:51,770
I love Vulcan.

1962
01:43:53,330 --> 01:43:55,450
I never read of that character before.

1963
01:43:57,650 --> 01:43:59,390
I'm speaking Russian?

1964
01:44:00,390 --> 01:44:00,610
Yeah.

1965
01:44:02,210 --> 01:44:03,410

01:44:04,110 --> 01:44:04,650
Excuse me.

1967
01:44:04,810 --> 01:44:05,410
This is it.

1968
01:44:05,430 --> 01:44:06,050
English.

1969
01:44:08,570 --> 01:44:11,030
It's funny because there's not even a Russian dog.

1970
01:44:11,190 --> 01:44:12,890
Yeah, it's like...

1971
01:44:15,050 --> 01:44:16,090
Having second thoughts.

1972
01:44:16,950 --> 01:44:17,230
No.

1973
01:44:18,490 --> 01:44:19,970
I have no love for this place.

1974
01:44:20,110 --> 01:44:20,630
Let's go.

1975
01:44:21,670 --> 01:44:22,670
What about your wife?

1976
01:44:23,690 --> 01:44:24,590
Are we just leaving her?

1977
01:44:25,570 --> 01:44:27,050
No, I don't think she's here.

1978
01:44:27,370 --> 01:44:30,010
Oh, we'll just leave his wife in Russia.

1979
01:44:31,450 --> 01:44:32,170
Yeah, yeah.

1980
01:44:32,550 --> 01:44:33,790
Like, when the fuck when I was...

1981
01:44:33,790 --> 01:44:35,410
When did I speak Russian?

1982
01:44:36,430 --> 01:44:37,730
We've been speaking Russian.

1983
01:44:37,730 --> 01:44:38,530
He's doing fine.

1984
01:44:38,930 --> 01:44:39,450
No injuries.

1985
01:44:40,030 --> 01:44:40,650
Good work, Snake.

1986
01:44:40,990 --> 01:44:43,130
Now hurry up and get Sokolov to the recovery point.

1987
01:44:43,470 --> 01:44:44,870
We'll rendezvous with you there.

1988
01:44:45,690 --> 01:44:46,210
We'll rendezvous.

1989
01:44:46,230 --> 01:44:46,930
What about the centuries?

1990
01:44:47,430 --> 01:44:48,530
I had to kill them.

1991
01:44:48,930 --> 01:44:49,950
There was no other way.

1992
01:44:50,570 --> 01:44:52,210
But no one will know we were involved.

1993
01:44:52,210 --> 01:44:54,630
Yeah, there was no other way for me to kill them.

1994

He's loyal to only one.

2011
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:51,820
What?

2012
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:53,740
How come he's paired up with all the snakes?

2013
01:46:54,880 --> 01:46:56,440
He's not paired up with all the snakes.

2014
01:46:56,500 --> 01:46:57,360
He's paired up with the wrong.

2015
01:46:58,400 --> 01:46:59,360
Wait, there's...

2016
01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:01,200
Hold on.

2017
01:47:09,940 --> 01:47:11,440
He's the Ocelot commander.

2018
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:13,140
Just... Okay.

2019
01:47:13,380 --> 01:47:14,980
Only when he puts on the hat.

2020
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:17,520
They don't...

2021
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:18,960
That's how they recognize him.

2022
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:20,360
Look at him spin.

2023
01:47:20,620 --> 01:47:23,620
Don't recognize him until he puts his hat on.

2024
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:25,920
Ocelot.

2025
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:28,700
Get out of here.

2026
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:30,020
Oh my god.

2027
01:47:30,420 --> 01:47:31,760
That's major Ocelot.

2028
01:47:33,100 --> 01:47:33,560
What?

2029
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:35,340
What?

2030
01:47:40,220 --> 01:47:40,860
Oh.

2031
01:47:42,580 --> 01:47:44,500
He's killing his fellow moon.

2032
01:47:44,820 --> 01:47:45,440
Wait, why?

2033
01:47:45,540 --> 01:47:46,740
Is he a traitor?

2034
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:48,940
He took his hat off.

2035
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:49,980
He won't recognize him!

2036
01:47:55,060 --> 01:47:56,640
It's like Superman.

2037
01:48:04,340 --> 01:48:06,080
He's like, bury the platypus.

2038
01:48:07,340 --> 01:48:08,380
Oh my god, he's...

2039
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:10,120
Whoa!

2040
01:48:12,240 --> 01:48:14,560
Oh my god, he saw a geometry.

2041
01:48:19,480 --> 01:48:21,080
He'll never guess what he does next.

2042
01:48:22,600 --> 01:48:23,300
He shoots him.

2043
01:48:26,100 --> 01:48:26,520
Hustler?

2044
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:27,400
Major Hustler?

2045
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:28,720
After he deals with this guy?

2046
01:48:28,820 --> 01:48:30,540
After he deals with this guy.

2047
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:33,900
He puts on a hat.

2048
01:48:34,360 --> 01:48:36,260
And then they'll go, Major Ocelot.

2049
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:38,260
Major Ocelot.

2050
01:48:38,940 --> 01:48:41,060
I can't say it feels good to kill a comrade.

2051
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:42,700
Even if it is for the crew.

2052
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:45,780
Soak along.

2053
01:48:46,140 --> 01:48:46,580
Take cover.

2054
01:48:52,540 --> 01:48:53,440
Call in the army.

2055
01:48:53,660 --> 01:48:55,180
He's gonna tug him.

2056
01:48:58,600 --> 01:49:00,040
He's gonna kiss him?

2057
01:49:01,720 --> 01:49:02,680
Is he gonna...

2058
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:05,780
You're not the boss, are you?

2059
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:20,060
That's what he does.

2060
01:49:22,580 --> 01:49:23,940
I told you you wouldn't guess.

2061
01:49:29,620 --> 01:49:31,700
That's why he's called us a lot.

2062
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:34,680
He's a cat boy.

2063
01:49:35,660 --> 01:49:35,880
Yeah.

2064
01:49:42,160 --> 01:49:44,060
If you're not the boss...

2065
01:49:44,420 --> 01:49:48,810
Then die.

2066
01:49:50,710 --> 01:49:51,790
His gun jammed!

2067
01:49:51,890 --> 01:49:53,230
Oh yeah, his gun's jammed!

2068
01:49:54,350 --> 01:49:56,170
Oh, guess I'll kill him.

2069
01:50:01,010 --> 01:50:01,530
Okay.

2070
01:50:03,110 --> 01:50:04,710
What do we do?

2071
01:50:07,350 --> 01:50:09,150
Wait, what if I just stabbed him?

2072
01:50:09,270 --> 01:50:13,730
Why did he say shoot the other one and then ran at him and
didn't shoot him at all?

2073
01:50:14,250 --> 01:50:15,810
Why are you all just running?

2074
01:50:18,050 --> 01:50:18,990

I don't know who he is.

2080
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:00,680
Oh,

2081
01:51:08,950 --> 01:51:10,150
I tranked his arm.

2082
01:51:11,310 --> 01:51:12,910
Oh, yeah, because it's not a real gun.

2083
01:51:16,260 --> 01:51:16,600
Oh, my God.

2084
01:51:16,680 --> 01:51:17,620
Here's where the yaoi comes.

2085
01:51:18,780 --> 01:51:20,560
But testing a technique you've only heard about.

2086
01:51:21,480 --> 01:51:22,040
The yaoi.

2087
01:51:22,780 --> 01:51:23,040
The yaoi.

2088
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:24,940
You were asking to have your gun jam on you.

2089
01:51:25,980 --> 01:51:28,300
Besides, I don't think you're cut out for an automatic
weapon.

2090
01:51:28,460 --> 01:51:30,820
You tend to twist your...

2091
01:51:30,820 --> 01:51:31,020
Oh.

2092
01:51:32,280 --> 01:51:34,140
He's doing an um actually on him.

2093
01:51:34,540 --> 01:51:34,900
I know.

2094
01:51:36,920 --> 01:51:40,300
You filthy American dog!

2095
01:51:41,640 --> 01:51:43,300
Enemies to lovers!

2096
01:51:55,840 --> 01:51:57,580
But that was some fancy shooting.

2097
01:51:58,300 --> 01:51:59,580
You're pretty good.

2098
01:52:03,960 --> 01:52:05,640
Pretty good.

2099
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:17,360
Do you see it?

2100
01:52:17,540 --> 01:52:18,420
Do you see the vision?

2101
01:52:21,100 --> 01:52:22,960
I see the vision.

2102
01:52:24,960 --> 01:52:26,520
I understand.

2103
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:31,900
I saw him.

2104
01:52:31,900 --> 01:52:32,740
It gets worse.

2105
01:52:33,080 --> 01:52:35,620
I saw him firmly grasped his arms.

2106
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:38,500
It gets worse.

2107
01:52:39,740 --> 01:52:42,520
Apparently they were taking orders from a Gru Colonel named
Vulgan.

2108
01:52:42,720 --> 01:52:43,660
A Gru Colonel?

2109
01:52:43,940 --> 01:52:46,860
Part of an internal Soviet force team, according to Sokolov.

2110
01:52:48,140 --> 01:52:49,060
Something between the KGB.

2111
01:52:49,080 --> 01:52:50,720
It's like spy versus spy.

2112
01:52:51,780 --> 01:52:52,060
Yeah.

2113
01:52:53,120 --> 01:52:56,480
Sokolov was being guarded by the KGB and hunted by Gru.

2114
01:52:57,340 --> 01:53:00,260
Snake, it sounds like this could be even hotter than Cuba.

2115
01:53:00,760 --> 01:53:01,780
I don't like it.

2116
01:53:02,300 --> 01:53:03,820
Something about the whole thing stinks.

2117
01:53:04,240 --> 01:53:04,680
I agree.

2118
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:05,460
You'd better hurry.

2119
01:53:05,900 --> 01:53:07,260
Sokolov ran off by himself.

2120
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:08,680
All right, you ready for an escort mission?

2121
01:53:09,100 --> 01:53:09,680
Oh, fuck.

2122
01:53:09,820 --> 01:53:10,400
Not an escort.

2123
01:53:10,420 --> 01:53:12,760
I'm not a fucking escort.

2124
01:53:13,020 --> 01:53:13,520
I'm just kidding.

2125
01:53:13,880 --> 01:53:14,540
Oh, thank God.

2126
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:15,380
Okay, wait.

2127
01:53:16,240 --> 01:53:16,970
Where is he?

2128
01:53:17,860 --> 01:53:18,760
Oh, there he is.

2129
01:53:18,860 --> 01:53:20,420
What happens if I...

2130
01:53:35,570 --> 01:53:38,190
I created the time paradox.

2131
01:53:38,770 --> 01:53:40,430
You created a time paradox.

2132
01:53:40,870 --> 01:53:43,190
Okay, but what if...

2133
01:53:43,190 --> 01:53:44,770
What if...

2134
01:53:44,770 --> 01:53:45,130
Uh-huh.

2135
01:53:57,890 --> 01:53:58,970
Time paradox.

2136
01:53:59,770 --> 01:54:02,910
Okay, okay, now that I know it.

2137
01:54:03,350 --> 01:54:06,650
So remember how I said that this is the first in the
timeline?

2138
01:54:07,630 --> 01:54:10,030
Yeah, you see Ocelot in the first game.

2139
01:54:10,730 --> 01:54:13,430
Oh, so he's not supposed to be dead.

2140
01:54:13,710 --> 01:54:15,430
That's why it's a time pair, though.

2141
01:54:20,030 --> 01:54:21,770
Okay, I gotta...

2142
01:54:21,770 --> 01:54:23,450
I gotta make sure they don't wake up.

2143
01:54:23,930 --> 01:54:25,530
Oh, okay, wait, I can...

2144
01:54:25,530 --> 01:54:26,750
Yeah, they don't wake up here.

2145
01:54:26,810 --> 01:54:27,690
You can do whatever you want.

2146
01:54:27,690 --> 01:54:28,250
Oh, I can?

2147
01:54:28,370 --> 01:54:29,010
Oh, okay.

2148
01:54:29,590 --> 01:54:30,330
They'll never wake up.

2149
01:54:30,350 --> 01:54:31,010
Oh, that's good.

2150
01:54:31,770 --> 01:54:33,490
Okay, so I don't have to actually kill them.

2151
01:54:33,930 --> 01:54:34,790
I want to see if he has items.

2152
01:54:35,590 --> 01:54:36,410
Yeah, I know.

2153
01:54:37,130 --> 01:54:38,190
I mean, I might as well.

2154
01:54:40,630 --> 01:54:41,430
No survivors.

2155
01:54:42,110 --> 01:54:43,170
Except for him, I guess.

2156
01:54:43,270 --> 01:54:44,210
I guess he survives.

2157
01:54:44,690 --> 01:54:45,430
He's like...

2158
01:54:46,010 --> 01:54:47,950
Oh, oh, it took us one more!

2159
01:54:49,810 --> 01:54:50,630
Wait, I want...

2160
01:54:51,410 --> 01:54:52,770
Can I kick them to death?

2161
01:54:57,620 --> 01:54:58,960
I can't put any of those.

2162
01:54:59,420 --> 01:55:00,900
Okay, let's see where I kick it.

2163
01:55:02,780 --> 01:55:21,370
okay wait I got me here I got me here he's not I'll keep him
alive I'll keep him alive still never have children the end

2164
01:55:21,370 --> 01:55:34,610
of his blood yeah I ended his blood life all of his friends
are dead one last kick for the ride before I go

2165
01:55:38,170 --> 01:55:48,530
okay back where I came from right oh wait I should call I
gotta call my dad give me a sec I call my dad give me a sec

2166
01:55:49,070 --> 01:55:59,130
what if he's proud of me the KGB and Gru both have their
sights set on Sokolov Gru is a military espionage outfit the

2167
01:55:59,130 --> 01:56:05,210
intelligence wing of the Soviet Defense Ministry's general
staff office It competes with the KGB, which is under the

2168
01:56:05,210 --> 01:56:09,050
Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the two are always
watching each other.

2169
01:56:09,050 --> 01:56:11,730
Okay, but he's not, did he not see what I just did?

2170
01:56:13,210 --> 01:56:14,410
That's your job.

2171
01:56:14,710 --> 01:56:17,310
You want a pat on the back every time you do your job?

2172
01:56:17,590 --> 01:56:19,270
I want a medal of honor.

2173
01:56:20,130 --> 01:56:21,170
You'll give one.

2174
01:56:22,730 --> 01:56:26,050
And Vulcan and the anti-cruise chair forces are using the
groom.

2175
01:56:26,610 --> 01:56:27,470
That's the idea.

2176
01:56:27,810 --> 01:56:29,610
The two factions are fighting over Sokolov.

2177
01:56:30,230 --> 01:56:31,590
We're in an extremely...

2178
01:56:33,690 --> 01:56:37,250
Wait, what is the difference between the KGB and Gru?

2179
01:56:41,170 --> 01:56:44,050
They're just different factions, basically.

2180
01:56:44,530 --> 01:56:45,910
But they're all under Russia, though.

2181
01:56:46,710 --> 01:56:52,090
Yeah, but I mean, it's like if the CIA and the FBI started
beefing.

2182
01:56:52,250 --> 01:56:53,330
Yeah, but why are they beefing?

2183
01:56:54,230 --> 01:56:57,420
I don't know.

2184
01:56:58,380 --> 01:56:59,760
They're just beefing.

2185
01:57:01,840 --> 01:57:03,840
Where is my lord up, Mint?

2186
01:57:04,820 --> 01:57:07,140
Thought you're the Metal Gear Encyclopedia.

2187
01:57:07,140 --> 01:57:08,620
He explained it.

2188
01:57:09,040 --> 01:57:10,500
He explained it.

2189
01:57:13,860 --> 01:57:19,120
Excuse me, my Metal Gear Encyclopedia is not working quite
well.

2190
01:57:19,760 --> 01:57:21,040
I don't know history.

2191
01:57:30,130 --> 01:57:31,330
There you go.

2192
01:57:31,770 --> 01:57:34,990
You're gonna be.

2193
01:57:35,430 --> 01:57:36,290
Spits knives.

2194
01:57:37,590 --> 01:57:39,090
Oh, also that?

2195
01:57:39,570 --> 01:57:40,210
Yeah.

2196
01:57:45,640 --> 01:57:47,300
Why doesn't he trust me?

2197
01:57:47,340 --> 01:57:48,020
Does he think I'm crazy?

2198
01:57:48,040 --> 01:57:56,580
with the frog mask um no he does trust you he's just really
scared because he's a weenie oh he's from weenie hut junior

and without support from friendly units oh oh That's the

2201
01:58:19,880 --> 01:58:20,920
Shaggle Hogs.

2202
01:58:20,940 --> 01:58:21,060
Whoa!

2203
01:58:22,180 --> 01:58:23,220
The Shadow what?

2204
01:58:24,040 --> 01:58:25,220
The Shaggle Hog.

2205
01:58:25,340 --> 01:58:27,060
Oh, I thought it was like Shadow Hog?

2206
01:58:27,280 --> 01:58:28,220
Shadow the Hedgehog?

2207
01:58:28,720 --> 01:58:29,880
Shadow the Hedgehog.

2208
01:58:30,260 --> 01:58:33,340
Phase one?

2209
01:58:33,340 --> 01:58:33,700
Phase one?

2210
01:58:33,720 --> 01:58:35,760
It won't be truly finished until we complete.

2211
01:58:36,280 --> 01:58:37,200
Phase two.

2212
01:58:37,840 --> 01:58:38,920
Phase two.

2213
01:58:39,240 --> 01:58:40,740
The weapon's true form.

2214
01:58:42,620 --> 01:58:47,900
If it is completed and the Colonel gets his hands on it, it
will be the end of the Cold War.

2215
01:58:48,040 --> 01:58:49,740
That's good, right?

2216
01:58:50,220 --> 01:58:51,700
Oh, wait, but for not America.

2217
01:58:52,520 --> 01:58:54,780
Yeah, that's not good for America.

2218
01:59:01,800 --> 01:59:03,820
I didn't want to die.

2219
01:59:05,600 --> 01:59:07,760
I wanted to see my wife and child again.

2220
01:59:07,760 --> 01:59:08,140
Oh, no.

2221
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:10,400
Oh, they're in America.

2222
01:59:11,440 --> 01:59:11,580
Yeah.

2223
01:59:14,740 --> 01:59:17,380
Cannot complete it without my help.

2224
01:59:17,860 --> 01:59:19,440
That's why they had to keep him alive.

2225
01:59:19,600 --> 01:59:22,780

01:59:26,740 --> 01:59:32,100

Bees B-Man!

2241
02:01:30,240 --> 02:01:35,480
Bro, it's like if Spider-Man has the power to shoot spiders
out of his hands.

2242
02:01:35,860 --> 02:01:37,300
No, that's spiders, man.

2243
02:01:37,320 --> 02:01:42,140
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I remember this natural character in
the Marvel universe.

Yeah, he's bees, man.

My friends, let us fight together again.

2246
02:01:51,780 --> 02:01:52,680
The Cobra unit.

2247
02:01:53,480 --> 02:01:54,340
The fear.

2248
02:01:55,040 --> 02:01:56,900

I'm defecting to the Soviet Union.

2276
02:03:28,040 --> 02:03:30,280
Sokolov is a little gift from my new hosts.

2277
02:03:32,420 --> 02:03:33,800
Recoiless nuclear warheads.

They were photoshopped.

2296
02:05:04,380 --> 02:05:06,120
He must die.

2297
02:05:09,680 --> 02:05:10,860
Oh, that's true.

2298
02:05:11,160 --> 02:05:12,860
He has to see shit with that mask.

2299
02:05:13,060 --> 02:05:13,760
That's so true.

2300
02:05:17,020 --> 02:05:19,100
There's no IOs in that mask.

2301
02:05:19,220 --> 02:05:30,800
you can't come with us you can't sit with us you're too
young you're bro you broke his arm you can't shake hands

2303
02:05:40,260 --> 02:05:50,860
oh the fake out oh no but that's his mom he's like mommy

2304
02:06:06,590 --> 02:06:08,910
It's because he looks so stupid

2305
02:06:13,330 --> 02:06:30,470
He didn't he didn't pass the test Back to back to us and
find It's like when a crocodile is released from the zoo See

2307
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:42,440

02:06:44,300 --> 02:06:45,300
Gotta follow mommy

2310
02:06:49,400 --> 02:06:58,680
My place is with them now I don't think he can hear you yeah
so what the does the parrot guy do like what why is the

2311
02:06:58,680 --> 02:07:09,620
special power is fucking bulging his eyes like um he uh he's
a sniper oh bulging your eyes does not make you snipe better

2312
02:07:09,620 --> 02:07:12,560
it could you don't know you can't do it

2313
02:07:18,340 --> 02:07:20,020
your codex going off

2314
02:07:30,330 --> 02:07:37,890
it's like when you extend your neck and you can see yeah you
see further away You bulge your eyes and you can see it

2315
02:07:37,890 --> 02:07:38,310
further.

2316
02:07:38,630 --> 02:07:41,230
I think it makes absolute common sense.

2317
02:07:41,550 --> 02:07:44,590
Yeah, like the fucking two centimeters further.

2318
02:07:46,670 --> 02:07:47,630
That's everything!

2319
02:07:48,090 --> 02:07:49,690
That's everything in sniping.

2320
02:07:50,650 --> 02:07:51,910
Oh yeah, welcome to healing.

2321
02:07:52,550 --> 02:07:53,250
Oh, nice.

2322
02:07:53,370 --> 02:07:54,770
I thought eating would heal me.

2323
02:07:56,170 --> 02:07:59,090
Well, it's like not really healing, it's like treating your
wounds.

2324
02:07:59,370 --> 02:07:59,610
Alright.

2325
02:08:00,530 --> 02:08:04,910
Okay, snake, just relax and it'll all be over before you
know it.

2326
02:08:08,620 --> 02:08:10,140
Stay with me.

2327
02:08:10,200 --> 02:08:11,960
I've seen people in worse shape before.

2328
02:08:12,680 --> 02:08:13,680
Think you can handle it?

2329
02:08:13,680 --> 02:08:15,140
Bro, he has a broken arm.

2330
02:08:15,680 --> 02:08:15,740
Major.

2331
02:08:17,040 --> 02:08:18,240
She messed him up.

2332
02:08:18,500 --> 02:08:18,740
Yeah.

2333
02:08:19,100 --> 02:08:20,180
She's defected.

2334
02:08:20,420 --> 02:08:21,520
We'll talk about that later.

2335
02:08:21,680 --> 02:08:23,140
First, we've got to get you patched up.

2336
02:08:23,400 --> 02:08:26,800
Why is they're not like, they're like unfazed by that.

2337
02:08:29,040 --> 02:08:31,720
If you select cure, you can start the treatment.

2338
02:08:31,880 --> 02:08:33,720
I can just cure my arm.

2339
02:08:33,980 --> 02:08:35,380
It is divided into two types of treatment.

2340
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:37,600
Medicine and surgical procedures.

2341
02:08:38,220 --> 02:08:39,980
They did surgery on a grape.

2342
02:08:40,240 --> 02:08:45,100
Fractured left elbow and rib bone and lacerations on your
upper arms, right elbow and abdomen.

2343
02:08:46,580 --> 02:08:49,000
They need to be fixed using surgical treatment.

2344
02:08:51,140 --> 02:08:55,480
Move the healing cursor with a movement stick to the
affected part of your body and press the inner button.

2345
02:08:56,380 --> 02:09:01,780
Once you've selected the affected area use the movement
stick to select the medical item and then press the inner

2346
02:09:01,780 --> 02:09:02,020
button.

2347
02:09:03,060 --> 02:09:05,940
With this method you can use items to help your recovery
process.

02:09:07,620 --> 02:09:16,140

02:15:31,970 --> 02:15:33,270
Wait, that's the wife?

2416
02:15:35,270 --> 02:15:37,270
I thought you said she's ugly.

2417
02:15:41,010 --> 02:15:41,930
In Seoul.

2418
02:15:45,570 --> 02:15:46,870
She's a nice catch.

2419
02:15:48,170 --> 02:15:49,810
I'll take her.

2420
02:15:50,210 --> 02:15:54,430
Not so fast, my dear.

2421
02:15:56,030 --> 02:15:57,710
Wait, Sokolov's cheated?

2422
02:15:58,510 --> 02:16:00,090
Yeah, he's kind of icky.

2423
02:16:00,390 --> 02:16:01,650
I can't believe him.

2424
02:16:06,110 --> 02:16:09,530
That's why he sent his family to America.

2425
02:16:09,930 --> 02:16:11,690
So that he could cheat.

2426
02:16:13,050 --> 02:16:14,430
Oh my god.

2427
02:16:17,190 --> 02:16:18,030

Pulled the trigger.

2434
02:16:52,510 --> 02:16:52,830
Oh.

2435
02:16:54,210 --> 02:16:55,790
You want to nuke your fellow Russians?

2436
02:16:57,490 --> 02:16:58,910
Remember the Alamo.

2437
02:16:59,510 --> 02:17:01,390
The Alamo.

2438
02:17:06,950 --> 02:17:09,190
Okay, but it's...

2439
02:17:09,190 --> 02:17:09,590
Oh.

2440
02:17:11,130 --> 02:17:12,370
There it goes.

2441
02:17:16,290 --> 02:17:17,070
Boom.

2442
02:17:17,930 --> 02:17:18,790
Oh my god.

2443
02:17:20,150 --> 02:17:21,810
Remember, are you remembering the Alamo?

2444
02:17:22,090 --> 02:17:23,430
I'm remembering the Alamo.

2445
02:17:27,030 --> 02:17:29,930
Snake is still over here, just like...

2446
02:17:30,470 --> 02:17:31,450

02:17:39,330 --> 02:17:39,850
He had a choice!

02:17:41,790 --> 02:17:43,590
Buy the fridge, quick!

Oh, he turned it louder, yeah?

2457

Yeah.

2458
02:18:36,720 --> 02:18:38,700
Yeah, but we won't be able to hear it a little bit.

2459
02:18:39,200 --> 02:18:41,140
You know what?

2460
02:18:52,860 --> 02:18:54,540
Maybe you shouldn't be watching us.

2461
02:18:56,080 --> 02:18:57,780
Actually, I don't think you should watch this.

2462
02:18:57,820 --> 02:18:58,300
Just listen.

2463
02:18:58,540 --> 02:18:59,300
Just listen to it.

2464
02:18:59,320 --> 02:19:00,780
I should close my eyes.

2465
02:19:01,300 --> 02:19:02,660
Yeah, I think you should close your eyes.

2466
02:19:03,660 --> 02:19:11,940
I forgot that the new version, like, of spoils i don't think
i would understand though even the spoilers come through i

2467
02:19:11,940 --> 02:19:15,680

2468
02:19:21,940 --> 02:19:25,960

pom-poms oh jesus fucking stupid bulge

2470
02:19:47,720 --> 02:19:54,720
This ordeal the trial to survive for the dead

2471
02:19:58,680 --> 02:20:02,300
We're real We're

2472
02:20:35,250 --> 02:21:00,960

2473
02:21:06,620 --> 02:21:07,300
Whoa!

2474
02:21:09,780 --> 02:21:10,660
One week later.

2475
02:21:10,920 --> 02:21:12,040
All right, let me turn it down.

2476
02:21:14,960 --> 02:21:15,640
Arriving

2477
02:21:22,090 --> 02:21:25,090
at the designated drone launch point.

2478
02:21:25,970 --> 02:21:28,090
Drone oil pressure and voltage are nominal.

2479
02:21:29,550 --> 02:21:31,210
Payload oxygen supply is nominal.

2480
02:21:32,190 --> 02:21:35,010
Power supply to payload any free system shows no problems.

2481
02:21:36,050 --> 02:21:37,490
No gusts.

2482
02:21:37,890 --> 02:21:39,730
All systems go for drone detachment.

2483
02:21:41,690 --> 02:21:42,930
Oh, that's me!

2484
02:21:43,930 --> 02:21:46,210
Wait, is my arm healed enough after a week?

2485
02:21:47,650 --> 02:21:48,530
Uh, apparently.

2486
02:21:49,030 --> 02:21:52,270
Yeah, I was gonna say, I don't think that's how bones heal.

2487
02:21:52,690 --> 02:21:52,930
Apparently, yeah.

2488
02:21:54,290 --> 02:21:56,990
Don't worry, they put me on a lot of steroids for this.

2489
02:21:57,750 --> 02:21:59,530
Okay, if you want to hold RB.

2490
02:22:00,270 --> 02:22:00,510
Yeah.

2491
02:22:01,290 --> 02:22:04,150
Just like hold it until like, you know.

2492
02:22:04,350 --> 02:22:05,710
Okay, I'm holding it.

2493
02:22:06,190 --> 02:22:07,970
Until like the end of the cutscene.

2494
02:22:13,510 --> 02:22:18,890
So how does it feel to be a patient in one of the most
advanced icus in the world whenever he's in the plan yeah

2495
02:22:18,890 --> 02:22:26,770
tell the suits about visiting hours i'll never get better
with them assault okay i turned it back to his original the

2496
02:22:26,770 --> 02:22:33,150
top brass's inquiry more like an interrogation according to
them i'm a traitor and an accomplice to the boss's defection

2497
02:22:33,150 --> 02:22:41,030
what i didn't know okay to be fair he was about to join a
defection she kicked them out let's just say neither one of

2498
02:22:41,030 --> 02:22:50,430
us is going to be made a national is going to die no this
fox is still one step ahead of the hounds the reason I came

2499
02:22:50,430 --> 02:22:57,590
to see you today Jack it's time for Fox to clear its neck
what are you talking about yeah what is he talking about Tom

2500
02:22:57,590 --> 02:23:09,650
we still got a chance has changed yeah what kind of chance
don't get too excited here have a cigar it's Cuban whoa nice

2501
02:23:09,650 --> 02:23:24,940
this morning I had a meeting with the CIA they decided when
they're going to execute us no something even bigger what's

2502
02:23:24,940 --> 02:23:34,580
the agent do the white house received an unexpected oh no
here it comes oh president johnson yes i hear you mr

2503
02:23:34,580 --> 02:23:41,880
chairman i hear you mr chairman it was a hotline call from
khrushchev to president johnson from the head of the soviet

2504
02:23:41,880 --> 02:23:53,800
union that's right a few days ago one of our design bureaus,
OKB 754, was destroyed in a nuclear explosion.

2505
02:23:55,160 --> 02:24:03,000
At about the same time, our anti-aircraft radar picked up a
signature that appeared to come from one of your military

2506
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:03,460
aircraft.

2507
02:24:04,380 --> 02:24:07,060
Does any of this sound familiar to you?

2508
02:24:08,740 --> 02:24:17,540
In retaliation, I have placed our armed forces on secondary
alert depending on your response i may be left with no

2509
02:24:17,540 --> 02:24:24,600
choice but to order the military to maximum alert and
unleash oh because they blame the americans for nuking with

2510
02:24:24,600 --> 02:24:34,960
the yeah because it was an american yeah yeah able to
survive the cuban incident yeah but my power is not as great

2511
02:24:34,960 --> 02:24:43,920
as it once was yeah and this is a documentary survive this
crisis yeah yeah Yeah, I'm learning real history right now.

2512
02:24:45,900 --> 02:24:48,160
I should have contacted you myself.

2513
02:24:48,480 --> 02:24:49,640
I should have contacted you.

2514
02:24:49,660 --> 02:24:52,600
Can't believe you got the real President Johnson to voice
act this?

2515
02:24:53,120 --> 02:24:54,200
Like crazy, crazy.

2516
02:24:54,540 --> 02:24:55,120
I don't know.

2517
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:57,520
So you haven't heard that.

2518
02:24:58,460 --> 02:25:04,060
The man who arranged the defection was a group colonel by
the name of Yevgeny Borosovic Volgin.

2519
02:25:05,120 --> 02:25:05,720
Volgin.

2520
02:25:06,680 --> 02:25:08,540
Of the Brezhne faction.

2521
02:25:10,260 --> 02:25:10,920
Go on.

2522
02:25:11,880 --> 02:25:21,500
who is the soldier her name is the boss she's a living
legend during world war ii she was the one who led us to

2523
02:25:21,500 --> 02:25:36,940
victory in that war in russia you know her as voyevoda you
mean voyevoda the boss yeah oh my god and she took two

2524
02:25:36,940 --> 02:25:42,880
miniature nuclear shells along with her the boss took two
miniature nuclear shells.

2525
02:25:44,840 --> 02:25:45,640
I'm afraid so.

2526
02:25:45,820 --> 02:25:48,620
I believe they were a gift for her new hosts.

2527
02:25:50,420 --> 02:25:54,840
The Davy Crockett Atomic Battle Group delivery system was
completed two years ago.

2528
02:25:56,460 --> 02:25:59,720
But serious problems were found with the launcher's range
and precision.

2529
02:26:00,920 --> 02:26:04,600
Although they were mass produced, they've never been
deployed in battle.

2530
02:26:05,700 --> 02:26:09,100
But Sokolos' research facility was completely wiped out.

2531
02:26:09,500 --> 02:26:11,100
The whole area is polluted.

2532
02:26:11,660 --> 02:26:11,860
Yeah.

2533
02:26:11,880 --> 02:26:13,920
Again, Snake lives through the radiation.

2534
02:26:14,420 --> 02:26:16,340
Condolences over this terrible tragedy.

2535
02:26:16,780 --> 02:26:19,740
So, they all live through the radiation.

2536
02:26:20,020 --> 02:26:21,260
Except the people that got hit.

2537
02:26:21,380 --> 02:26:22,780
Yeah, except for, like, the people who died.

2538
02:26:23,120 --> 02:26:25,720
The thousands of people that died in the research facility.

2539
02:26:26,180 --> 02:26:28,060
I wouldn't say thousands were in there.

2540
02:26:28,300 --> 02:26:29,500
Probably, like...

2541
02:26:29,500 --> 02:26:31,320
Maybe like one or two, you know.

2542
02:26:31,480 --> 02:26:34,200
Yeah, it was a pretty small thing.

2543
02:26:34,520 --> 02:26:38,320
Yeah, two people that forgot they forgot to notify.

2544
02:26:39,460 --> 02:26:40,580
Yes, that's correct.

2545
02:26:41,880 --> 02:26:50,520
American government denies any involvement in the affair is
that right as well that's correct we were not involved in

2546
02:26:50,520 --> 02:26:58,880
any way then what was a US military aircraft doing on our
radar screen it was clearly in a violation of our airspace

2547
02:26:58,880 --> 02:27:06,040
oh USA USA USA

2548
02:27:11,880 --> 02:27:21,440
else to tell you the army like the american flags while he's
talking about that say it again our government had nothing

2549
02:27:21,440 --> 02:27:32,300
to do with it and i would like dearly to believe however i'm
afraid my power i need not send an aircraft i will need some

2550
02:27:32,300 --> 02:27:42,380
kind of proof that this was not the action of the american
government you have one week you must catch the boss

2551
02:27:42,380 --> 02:27:44,340
yourselves and recover One week.

2552
02:27:44,800 --> 02:27:45,620
One week.

2553
02:27:46,760 --> 02:27:48,160
I have a deadline.

2554
02:27:48,900 --> 02:27:50,200
Then you can be home for Christmas.

2555
02:27:51,720 --> 02:27:52,240
Yeah!

2556
02:27:53,680 --> 02:27:54,140
Yes.

2557
02:27:55,300 --> 02:27:57,420
Preferably something painful.

2558
02:27:58,360 --> 02:28:01,680
Prove to me that this is not merely another one of your
tricks.

2559
02:28:03,100 --> 02:28:05,800
The boss should be close to Colonel Volgan.

2560
02:28:06,900 --> 02:28:08,260
Now about a little co-action.

2561
02:28:09,260 --> 02:28:11,400
I would not expect too much if I were you.

2562
02:28:11,600 --> 02:28:13,520
The political situation here is on stake.

2563
02:28:13,540 --> 02:28:14,480
Oh no.

2564
02:28:14,660 --> 02:28:18,540
And Colonel Vulcan is a member of the Brezhnev faction,
which seeks to topple him.

2565
02:28:19,520 --> 02:28:19,740
Yeah.

2566
02:28:20,020 --> 02:28:20,800
One week.

2567
02:28:21,180 --> 02:28:22,780
You have only one week.

2568
02:28:23,220 --> 02:28:26,380
And if it is not too much to ask, do something about Vulcan
as well.

2569
02:28:26,400 --> 02:28:27,180
It's been one week.

2570
02:28:27,640 --> 02:28:28,940
I don't know.

2571
02:28:29,780 --> 02:28:31,760
What happens if he doesn't do it in one week?

2572
02:28:32,080 --> 02:28:32,680
Means nothing.

2573
02:28:34,340 --> 02:28:35,300
Um, then...

2574
02:28:35,300 --> 02:28:36,820
Well, uh...

2575
02:28:36,820 --> 02:28:38,180
Like, does he have to?

2576
02:28:38,640 --> 02:28:40,060
It's not really that much of a threat.

2577
02:28:40,400 --> 02:28:41,820
If his government's gonna get toppled.

2578
02:28:43,540 --> 02:28:45,860
Yeah, do you want Volgan running the country?

2579
02:28:47,620 --> 02:28:48,960
He might be...

2580
02:28:48,960 --> 02:28:51,460
He might have, like, good policies.

2581
02:28:51,740 --> 02:28:53,240
You don't know that.

2582
02:28:56,060 --> 02:28:58,520
We don't know his policies, okay?

2583
02:29:02,540 --> 02:29:03,820
USA, USA.

2584
02:29:06,580 --> 02:29:08,900
Yeah, a new world war.

2585
02:29:09,420 --> 02:29:09,900
Oh, no.

2586
02:29:09,920 --> 02:29:10,840
World War III.

2587
02:29:11,620 --> 02:29:12,260
World War III.

2588
02:29:13,540 --> 02:29:15,980
They've got something to cheer for a bit.

2589
02:29:16,100 --> 02:29:16,600
USA!

2590
02:29:17,620 --> 02:29:18,200
USA!

2591
02:29:18,980 --> 02:29:19,560
USA!

2592
02:29:19,560 --> 02:29:19,760
USA!

2593
02:29:20,100 --> 02:29:20,200
USA!

2594
02:29:20,200 --> 02:29:22,760
The boss ourselves will prove America's innocence.

2595
02:29:25,480 --> 02:29:29,420
The higher ups have decided that you're the only one capable
of pulling this off.

2596
02:29:29,920 --> 02:29:29,980
Me?

2597
02:29:30,800 --> 02:29:32,040
You were her last apprentice.

2598
02:29:32,460 --> 02:29:33,280
Screw this one up.

2599
02:29:33,440 --> 02:29:35,100
Who's her other apprentice though?

2600
02:29:35,540 --> 02:29:36,760
The one before me?

2601
02:29:41,590 --> 02:29:43,210
Should there be one before me?

2602
02:29:43,910 --> 02:29:45,090
You're the best one though.

2603
02:29:45,390 --> 02:29:47,050
Oh, heart hold RV now.

2604
02:29:47,250 --> 02:29:47,250
Okay.

2605
02:29:48,210 --> 02:29:48,710
Oh shit!

2606
02:29:49,330 --> 02:29:49,710
Look up.

2607
02:29:50,190 --> 02:29:51,870
Look up.

2608
02:29:52,270 --> 02:29:53,850
Who the fuck is...

2609
02:29:53,850 --> 02:29:55,030
You mean Gucci?

2610
02:29:55,510 --> 02:29:56,130
Who is she?

2611
02:29:56,650 --> 02:29:57,970
Who the fuck is she?

2612
02:29:59,170 --> 02:30:01,970
There was a defection in September 1960.

2613
02:30:02,790 --> 02:30:03,830
You remember it?

2614
02:30:04,510 --> 02:30:08,850
Who is she?

2615
02:30:08,870 --> 02:30:12,570
That's the first of many women you will encounter in this.

2616
02:30:15,390 --> 02:30:28,330
situation their codenames are adam and eve oh adam and eve

2617
02:30:28,330 --> 02:30:29,870

02:30:41,040 --> 02:30:43,360

2620
02:31:11,500 --> 02:31:12,760
No, I swear.

2621
02:31:13,280 --> 02:31:14,680
Now we're actually playing Ace Combat.

2622
02:31:15,060 --> 02:31:15,520
Oh, yay.

2623
02:31:15,840 --> 02:31:16,760
Ace Combat time.

2624
02:31:22,860 --> 02:31:28,740
I think that's been like 80% cutscenes and 20% gameplay.

2625
02:31:29,680 --> 02:31:30,740
Maybe, yeah.

2626
02:31:33,440 --> 02:31:33,620
Hold.

2627
02:31:42,860 --> 02:31:43,120
Hold.

2628
02:31:43,920 --> 02:31:44,140
Hold.

2629
02:31:44,660 --> 02:31:45,120
Whoa.

2630
02:31:57,040 --> 02:31:59,620
Okay, the landing was not as cool as last time.

2631
02:32:00,920 --> 02:32:02,000
It's a little rough there.

2632
02:32:02,520 --> 02:32:04,000
He's like kind of beat up.

2633
02:32:04,080 --> 02:32:04,940
Yeah, yeah.

2634
02:32:05,320 --> 02:32:06,900
He took one week off.

2635
02:32:07,440 --> 02:32:07,480
Yeah.

2636
02:32:08,560 --> 02:32:09,680
My man's tired.

Yeah.

2639
02:32:20,580 --> 02:32:23,360
He's probably like on so many medicines.

2640
02:32:23,460 --> 02:32:24,600
Oh yeah, pain medication.

2641
02:32:26,880 --> 02:32:30,000
He's just on the maximum limit of pain meds right now.

2642
02:32:31,560 --> 02:32:41,460

He can just do that?

2648
02:33:34,400 --> 02:33:37,020
He picked the wrong one.

2649
02:33:37,700 --> 02:33:39,600
What the fuck?

2650
02:33:39,760 --> 02:33:40,940
See the movie, The Great Escape.

2651
02:33:41,540 --> 02:33:43,440
Okay, The Great Escape.

2652
02:33:44,440 --> 02:33:49,380
Anyway, it's based on a true story about prisoners who
escape from a POW camp in Nazi Germany.

2653
02:33:49,980 --> 02:33:55,180
The prisoners dig three tunnels as part of their plan, but
the Nazis find two of the tunnels before they're finished.

2654
02:33:55,840 --> 02:33:58,560
Prisoners succeed in escaping by using the last remaining
tunnel.

2655
02:33:59,500 --> 02:34:00,900
The names of those three tunnels...

2656
02:34:00,920 --> 02:34:10,080
were dick harry and oh does he want to be dick i get it you
use the name yeah escaped in as your he is that's exactly

2658
02:34:18,460 --> 02:34:25,720
unlucky tunnels it was discovered by the nazis before it was
finished i watched the movie again just to make sure well

There's nothing else in her brain.

2667
02:35:34,620 --> 02:35:36,400
If you have any questions, just ask him.

2668
02:35:36,880 --> 02:35:40,540
His frequency is 148.41.

2669
02:35:40,540 --> 02:35:41,080
Oh yeah, sorry.

2670
02:35:41,260 --> 02:35:41,980

Look!

2709
02:39:12,480 --> 02:39:14,700
They put the cigar back- Because your equipment limit is

It's okay.

02:39:24,020 --> 02:39:25,300
There's no way there's people here.

2716
02:39:29,160 --> 02:39:30,540
All right, back to another cutscene.

2717
02:39:30,800 --> 02:39:31,360
Yeah, about that.

2718
02:39:31,420 --> 02:39:32,500
There's definitely people here.

2719
02:39:36,520 --> 02:39:37,340
No

2720
02:39:40,780 --> 02:39:47,980
She's so shiny In the moonlight it's kind of beautiful

2721
02:39:52,850 --> 02:39:54,290
It's out of moonlight

2722
02:40:04,390 --> 02:40:06,910
Looks like everyone's enjoying the watch along

2723
02:40:13,140 --> 02:40:21,120
It's gold chip Oh my god, it's gold chip What are you doing
here?

2724
02:40:22,800 --> 02:40:24,460
The mask is so bright.

2725
02:40:24,660 --> 02:40:25,200
I know.

2726
02:40:31,500 --> 02:40:32,080
Oh, shit.

2727
02:40:32,300 --> 02:40:33,640
I learned nothing, apparently.

2728
02:40:34,780 --> 02:40:35,920
Well, you were in the hospital.

2729
02:40:36,080 --> 02:40:38,040
She needs to give you a little bit of a break.

2730
02:40:38,180 --> 02:40:38,920
I know, right?

2731
02:40:39,020 --> 02:40:40,640
Mom, why didn't you answer my calls?

2732
02:40:41,780 --> 02:40:42,500
Go home.

2733
02:40:43,900 --> 02:40:48,820
She wants to, she wants to, she's like, what is she, oh my
gosh, she might have left the stove on and didn't realize.

2734
02:40:49,160 --> 02:40:49,760
Oh, yeah.

2735
02:40:51,020 --> 02:40:51,380
Sons?

2736
02:40:57,540 --> 02:40:58,720
What about me?

2737
02:40:58,800 --> 02:41:00,540
Am I not included in the sun's part?

2738
02:41:02,980 --> 02:41:04,320
I don't think so.

2739
02:41:05,040 --> 02:41:06,860
I think she hates you when you wear the mask.

2740
02:41:07,160 --> 02:41:12,020
Actually, these cutscenes are all different because she,
like, loves and accepts you if you're not wearing your mask.

2741
02:41:14,340 --> 02:41:16,720
But it's who I am, mom!

2742
02:41:18,380 --> 02:41:20,920
Oh my god, she revoked it.

2743
02:41:22,440 --> 02:41:24,600
It's like, don't call me, mom.

2744
02:41:24,860 --> 02:41:26,060
Don't call me, mom.

2745
02:41:26,700 --> 02:41:30,060
No, you're my one and only boss.

2746
02:41:30,620 --> 02:41:30,660
No.

2747
02:41:31,440 --> 02:41:31,840
No.

2748
02:41:32,460 --> 02:41:33,360
This isn't America.

2749
02:41:34,280 --> 02:41:34,600
Oh.

2750
02:41:43,400 --> 02:41:46,200
Oh, she's pretending she's faking his death.

2751
02:41:50,290 --> 02:41:52,070
How much ammo is in that gun?

2752
02:41:52,210 --> 02:41:52,570
Jesus.

2753
02:41:54,270 --> 02:41:55,050
Like a lot.

2754
02:41:55,290 --> 02:41:56,630
That should stir things up a bit.

2755
02:41:57,590 --> 02:41:58,390
You'd better hurry.

2756
02:42:05,530 --> 02:42:06,690
Oh, no, it's raining.

2757
02:42:07,570 --> 02:42:09,510
The border is 60 miles south of you.

2758
02:42:09,990 --> 02:42:10,050
Oh.

2759
02:42:10,050 --> 02:42:11,430
You ought to be able to run that far.

2760
02:42:16,060 --> 02:42:16,720
Oh, no.

2761
02:42:16,960 --> 02:42:18,140
It's not coming off.

2762
02:42:18,320 --> 02:42:19,760
The paint's not coming off.

2763
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:26,380
You're like the tin man from the Wizard of Oz.

2764
02:42:27,420 --> 02:42:28,400
What about you, Jack?

2765
02:42:33,300 --> 02:42:37,380
I'm gonna get like the fucking poison to my skin.

2766
02:42:37,500 --> 02:42:38,960
The mission or your beliefs.

2767
02:42:39,860 --> 02:42:43,300
Your duty to your unit or your personal feelings.

2768
02:42:52,020 --> 02:42:52,560
Mom.

2769
02:42:55,340 --> 02:42:55,960
Mom.

2770
02:42:58,800 --> 02:43:00,460
I don't expect you to forgive me.

2771
02:43:01,480 --> 02:43:02,400
I miss you, mom.

2772
02:43:03,020 --> 02:43:03,360
Mommy.

2773
02:43:04,940 --> 02:43:07,360
Mommy, you don't even know how to get the paint off.

2774
02:43:11,980 --> 02:43:13,720
We're one week, mommy!

2775
02:43:15,020 --> 02:43:16,940
We're one week, mommy!

2776
02:43:18,400 --> 02:43:19,040
Whoa!

2777
02:43:23,360 --> 02:43:24,620
This part's so mean.

2778
02:43:24,940 --> 02:43:25,660
Oh no!

2779
02:43:26,060 --> 02:43:26,900
What the fuck?

2780
02:43:29,100 --> 02:43:30,920
She didn't have to do that.

2781
02:43:31,100 --> 02:43:32,520
No, what the fuck?

2782
02:43:33,200 --> 02:43:34,420
She's so mean!

2783
02:43:35,280 --> 02:43:37,100
She's like, go...

2784
02:43:37,100 --> 02:43:42,900
It's like, you know when there's like shows where they tell
like an animal to like go back go back to the wild when they

02:43:42,900 --> 02:43:58,170

2786
02:43:58,170 --> 02:44:06,670
like go back butterfree enemy scouts yeah i know but what
was the boss doing here in the first place there's got to be

2787
02:44:06,670 --> 02:44:13,010
a leak somewhere no that's impossible the man the boss is
working with vulgar and isn't exactly on speaking terms I

2788
02:44:13,010 --> 02:44:22,390

planning on playing after this cutscene end we can call it

2789
02:44:22,390 --> 02:44:31,450
yeah that's how it is and if you don't accept it you'll
never be able to beat her that's not the problem in terms of

2790
02:44:31,450 --> 02:44:38,170
sheer technique I'll never be able to beat her I know that
all too well you've got to do it snake she's your enemy and

2791
02:44:38,170 --> 02:44:42,970

2792
02:44:45,010 --> 02:44:45,490
Mommy!

2793
02:44:47,490 --> 02:44:47,970
Mommy!

2794
02:44:49,810 --> 02:44:49,830
Mommy!

2795
02:44:50,010 --> 02:44:51,730
Instead of my...

2796
02:44:51,730 --> 02:44:52,610
Instead of my...

2797
02:44:52,610 --> 02:44:55,230
Get poisoned with the gold.

2798
02:44:55,650 --> 02:44:58,110
Whatever you do, don't let them see me.

2799
02:44:58,670 --> 02:45:00,610
Oh yeah, no, they definitely are gonna see me.

2800
02:45:03,250 --> 02:45:05,430
Oh yeah, they're like coming right now.

2801
02:45:05,750 --> 02:45:06,070
Yeah, yeah.

2802
02:45:06,950 --> 02:45:07,590
The gold.

2803
02:45:08,230 --> 02:45:10,710
You know, I think that's a good point to stop on because
I'm...

2804
02:45:10,710 --> 02:45:11,290
Did you see him?

2805
02:45:11,310 --> 02:45:12,010
Did you see him?

2806
02:45:13,810 --> 02:45:14,770
There he is.

2807
02:45:15,030 --> 02:45:15,890
No, turn back around.

2808
02:45:16,330 --> 02:45:17,450
They're going to see you, like, immediately.

2809
02:45:18,810 --> 02:45:19,670
Turn the other way.

2810
02:45:22,330 --> 02:45:22,850
Oh.

2811
02:45:26,750 --> 02:45:27,670
Okay, wait.

2812
02:45:28,550 --> 02:45:28,710
Wait, wait, wait.

2813
02:45:28,850 --> 02:45:29,470
Let me...

2814
02:45:30,010 --> 02:45:31,630
I think you should save the game.

2815
02:45:32,370 --> 02:45:34,970
Yeah, and then give me a sec.

2816
02:45:35,270 --> 02:45:40,750
Maybe if I put this on real quick, and then put on...

2817
02:45:47,220 --> 02:45:48,500
I think they still see you.

2818
02:45:48,660 --> 02:45:48,780
What the?

2819
02:45:48,800 --> 02:45:49,540
Oh my god!

2820
02:45:49,900 --> 02:45:51,060
What hit me?

2821
02:45:51,700 --> 02:45:52,320
Oh my god, it's okay.

2822
02:45:52,560 --> 02:45:53,660
A man can hit you.

2823
02:45:53,900 --> 02:45:54,900
He kicked you.

2824
02:45:55,100 --> 02:45:55,560
It's okay.

2825
02:45:55,920 --> 02:45:56,680
See, look at that.

2826
02:45:56,780 --> 02:45:57,260
We're fine.

2827
02:45:57,860 --> 02:45:58,480
Oh my god.

2828
02:45:58,740 --> 02:45:59,340
Okay, that's safe.

2829
02:45:59,540 --> 02:46:00,880
How do I...

2830
02:46:00,880 --> 02:46:02,560
I think this is the perfect stopping point.

2831
02:46:03,620 --> 02:46:05,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2832
02:46:07,320 --> 02:46:08,420
Wait, can I call her?

2833
02:46:08,860 --> 02:46:10,660
Well, you could, yeah.

2834
02:46:10,900 --> 02:46:12,180
You could do whatever you want, honestly.

2835
02:46:12,880 --> 02:46:13,280
Paramedic.

2836
02:46:13,420 --> 02:46:15,620
Snake, it's so good to hear from you again.

2837
02:46:16,280 --> 02:46:17,100
Same here.

2838
02:46:17,540 --> 02:46:18,840
It's been a week, hasn't it?

2839
02:46:19,160 --> 02:46:20,240
Four days, actually.

2840
02:46:20,900 --> 02:46:21,640
Four days?

2841
02:46:22,380 --> 02:46:24,120
He said it was a week.

2842
02:46:25,360 --> 02:46:26,720
No, she visited him.

2843
02:46:27,040 --> 02:46:27,220
Oh.

2844
02:46:27,560 --> 02:46:28,780
Oh, she saw him naked.

2845
02:46:31,560 --> 02:46:31,840
Whoa.

2846
02:46:32,380 --> 02:46:33,620
That's like first base.

2847
02:46:36,540 --> 02:46:38,860
Why are they talking like this?

2848
02:46:39,140 --> 02:46:41,040
I believe that you were like that until just yesterday.

2849
02:46:41,500 --> 02:46:42,880
In fact, you really shouldn't even...

2850
02:46:42,880 --> 02:46:44,480
Better luck next time.

2851
02:46:44,620 --> 02:46:46,160
Better luck next time.

2852
02:46:46,280 --> 02:46:49,120
If you start to run low, don't push yourself.

2853
02:46:49,620 --> 02:46:50,980
Eat something to replenish your stamina.

2854
02:46:52,020 --> 02:46:53,860
And try not to get yourself hurt.

2855
02:46:54,280 --> 02:46:55,980
Try not to get yourself hurt, you know?

2856
02:46:56,480 --> 02:47:00,960
Go into the survival viewer immediately and treat yourself
using cure.

2857
02:47:01,620 --> 02:47:02,060
Yeah, yeah.

2858
02:47:02,620 --> 02:47:04,560
I can see you still know how to nag.

2859
02:47:05,300 --> 02:47:05,600
Oh.

2860
02:47:06,180 --> 02:47:08,120
And I can see you still don't know when to keep your mouth.

2861
02:47:08,300 --> 02:47:08,760
Whoa!

2862
02:47:09,680 --> 02:47:14,980
Also, by the way, I heard you're going to lose your medical
license if this mission fails.

2863
02:47:15,620 --> 02:47:16,080
Yes.

2864
02:47:16,280 --> 02:47:19,000
There was talk of that, but the mission won't fail.

2865
02:47:19,660 --> 02:47:19,900
Will it?

2866
02:47:20,260 --> 02:47:21,360
Of course not.

2867
02:47:21,480 --> 02:47:22,000
Good.

2868
02:47:22,460 --> 02:47:23,300
I believe in you.

2869
02:47:24,080 --> 02:47:24,740
But you know what?

2870
02:47:25,300 --> 02:47:25,780
See?

2871
02:47:26,180 --> 02:47:27,200
She doesn't care!

2872
02:47:27,940 --> 02:47:30,540
Didn't they use that to force you to participate in this
operation?

2873
02:47:31,340 --> 02:47:32,140
No, I volunteered.

2874
02:47:32,180 --> 02:47:33,480
Yeah, that makes sense.

2875
02:47:33,580 --> 02:47:35,140
I was going to be like, who cares?

2876
02:47:35,580 --> 02:47:35,920
Yeah.

2877
02:47:37,240 --> 02:47:37,760
Oh.

2878
02:47:38,840 --> 02:47:39,360
Oh.

2879
02:47:41,220 --> 02:47:43,380
Oh, I didn't mommy accept me.

2880
02:47:45,020 --> 02:47:46,260
Why didn't she look?

2881
02:47:46,280 --> 02:47:47,680
Defect with her.

2882
02:47:53,120 --> 02:47:57,900
My mommy was better.

2883
02:47:59,060 --> 02:48:01,600
You can thank me when you get back.

2884
02:48:04,060 --> 02:48:04,780
Alright.

2885
02:48:05,880 --> 02:48:07,620
And then save.

2886
02:48:09,060 --> 02:48:09,780
Saving the game, Snake?

2887
02:48:10,160 --> 02:48:10,400
Yeah.

2888
02:48:10,880 --> 02:48:13,780
Everyone is trying to kill me, but I'll save my game.

2889
02:48:14,400 --> 02:48:15,040
Yeah.

2890
02:48:15,640 --> 02:48:16,000
Probably.

2891
02:48:16,280 --> 02:48:24,620
yeah she doesn't even tell you about a movie what the fuck
she just sends you back into the wild she just sends me back

2892
02:48:24,620 --> 02:48:34,140
i was like i'm dirt what about the movie fun fact i don't
even get a fun fact it has to be a fun fact yes please i

2893
02:48:34,140 --> 02:48:44,400
thought she was gonna look after me you just yeah but she's
not gonna tell me a fun movie fact oh you're in trouble what

2894
02:48:44,400 --> 02:48:49,360
i i have so much time to listen to movie trivia right now.

2895
02:48:50,920 --> 02:48:52,340
As I'm in like alert.

2896
02:48:53,180 --> 02:48:55,900
As like four people are trying to kill me.

2897
02:48:56,100 --> 02:48:58,740
I'm like come on, give me a movie trivia.

2898
02:49:00,860 --> 02:49:07,880
But that was fun for part one of Metal Gear Solid Delta
Snake Eater.

2899
02:49:08,140 --> 02:49:10,820
I had to think of it to remember the long ass title.

2900
02:49:10,880 --> 02:49:12,340
What do you think so far?

2901
02:49:12,960 --> 02:49:15,000
I think it's a very fun watch along.

2902
02:49:15,280 --> 02:49:21,640
I think I want to know, I want to know, like, well, I guess
I'll ask later.

2903
02:49:21,940 --> 02:49:29,680
I'm just going to say, like, what you're, what, I want to
know, like, what your predictions for the series are.

2904
02:49:30,120 --> 02:49:31,420
My predictions so far?

2905
02:49:31,660 --> 02:49:37,520
Well, obviously I'm going to kill her because I don't know
she existed as a character, right?

2906
02:49:37,720 --> 02:49:43,140
So, like, I feel like I'm, I know Ocelot is going to live
because I killed him and they're like, you can't do that.

2907
02:49:43,180 --> 02:49:44,140
That's a time paradox.

2908
02:49:47,040 --> 02:49:53,080
so I have no idea about the Vulcan guy I was like who the
fuck is that guy but like I'm like also I didn't know there

2909
02:49:53,080 --> 02:50:00,820
was the boss I guess after she dies big boss comes along and
takes over like that's where big boss is because the boss is

2910
02:50:00,820 --> 02:50:10,000
over so they need a successor and that's big boss and then I
assume that um paramedic becomes someone else later on too

2911
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:17,220
because like maybe I don't know they seem quite quite close
and then um I I know there's more snake.

2912
02:50:17,360 --> 02:50:19,120
There's more than one snake, apparently.

2913
02:50:19,620 --> 02:50:21,600
So, I don't know.

2914
02:50:21,720 --> 02:50:23,500
Maybe this guy dies in this game.

2915
02:50:23,640 --> 02:50:25,880
