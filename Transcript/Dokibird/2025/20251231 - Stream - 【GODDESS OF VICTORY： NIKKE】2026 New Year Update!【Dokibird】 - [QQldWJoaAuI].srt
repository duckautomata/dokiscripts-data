80
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,470
Um, what else, what else?

81
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:45,650
Uh, oh yeah, so basically this this uh because we were there
for the third year anniversary um this basically uh carries

82
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:51,950
on from the story from the third year anniversary remember
when we had a vr chat thing with uh nike uh the sponsor of

83
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:58,570
that and how someone died and i was like don't worry guys i
can save her and then i started throwing money at her but

84
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:04,930
then she never recovered um so it follows the story from
that it was she's dead like one of the main one of the i

85
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:08,790
would i don't know if i should say is it main She's gone
now?

86
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:16,570
She's, yeah, like a lot of apparently a lot of Miki's died,
so we're following the story from that.

87
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:24,090
And they actually killed off, like, they actually killed off
one of the main characters from the storyline.

88
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:29,910
And now we are following Snow White's story.

89
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:34,810
Yeah, apparently quite a couple of characters died too.

90
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,170
And it continues from that plot.

91
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:44,850
they you know we we didn't i know it's crazy but we didn't
succeed with the rapture queen i know after everything i did

92
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:58,250
in 3d we didn't win the fight i know it's actually crazy so
um so we're focusing on that story of snow white um i mean

93
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:07,650
you know what even though even though snow white's not here
i will do a poll in her honor i will do yeah the rapture

94
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:14,790

hours of this maybe i'll be lucky i'll do a one pull in her

00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,700
I'll feed her ramsticks later.

162
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,140
Oh, wait.

163
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,360
Um...

164
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,120
Okay, so I replaced...

165
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,900
Who did I replace?

166
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,440
I replaced Novel with...

167
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,420
Wait, should I replace Mordernia with...

168
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,280
Brid?

169
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:07,140
Wait, no, I can't replace Novel with her, because, like,
she's the three-bullet thing, and I don't have any three

170
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:07,540
bullets.

171
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,020
Should I replace her with Modernia, then?

172
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:17,400
JK, I know I just said all of that, but now I'm replacing...
I'm replacing Modernia with...

173
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,700
Yeah, I need her thingy, this thing.

So, shouldn't I remove...

175
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,260
I should replace Novel?

176
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:28,860
I should?

177
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,080

That's crazy.

199
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,410
Anyway, let's get into this story.

they've they supported me uh for so long like we were there

202
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:26,290
since the very beginning uh of Nikkei when it first came out
and now it you know we're all the way to the third year

203
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:32,870

204
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:38,010

for this.

205
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:44,350
Anyway, before we begin, I have, we have to watch the PV for
all the new stuff that's going on.

206
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,290
I almost forgot the PV.

207
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:46,750
Sorry, I got too excited doing the pulls.

208
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:53,330
So let's watch the, let's watch the video for all the new
updates, guys.

209
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,190
I believe it is.

210
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,090
Whoops, not that.

211
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:58,850
Whoa, whoops.

212
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:01,050
Oh, sorry.

213
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:04,290
So if you guys saw all those things bouncing around, it's
because I...

214
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:08,750
I had to like, I actually moved one of the browsers.

215
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:10,810
All right, here you go.

216
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,410
Oh, there she is.

217
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:18,190
She departed without any regrets.

218
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,020
No regrets.

219
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,320
I mean, they lost the war though.

220
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,380
We lost the battle.

221
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,460
We can't save everyone.

222
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,340
What then, pray?

223
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:38,460
Are we to tuck our tails betwixt our legs like hounds
defeated and slink That was me!

224
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,300
That was me!

225
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:41,780
How

226
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:48,150
are you doing?

227
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:50,070
Are you okay?

228
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:52,790
Look, Lilith!

229
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:53,370
Oh no!

230
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:53,850
Lilith!

231
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:54,790
No!

232
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,220
She's one of the people that died, right?

233
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,340
I'm a goddess.

234
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,700
I have to do this.

235
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:18,370
This time, I will grant you true rest.

236
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:38,350
There she is Oh There she is she's here for revenge now you
go girl you got this I believe All right, don't worry.

237
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:41,670
I got her to see my snow white

238
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,070
My substitute

239
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:52,550
She's she's just like her they both wear white guys.

240
00:20:52,750 --> 00:21:04,710
She's just like her not it's literally the same guys it's
like oh wait look free stuff yay free stuff i assume like

241
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:13,850
the storyline for this is oh my gosh oops sorry when's the
story mode street i'm i'm literally doing it oh wait here

242
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:22,520
you go that's me i just know what

243
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:35,040
oh i just realized you can hear so this is what it's like to
be able to move your body freely oh yeah because she's

244
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:44,920
always like geared up i'd forgotten what this felt like
considering your condition it's impressive any of you were

245
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:53,680
able to move around on the surface what a complete mess yes
spoiler spoiler pilot i mean too fair every sponsor is a

246
00:21:53,680 --> 00:22:00,860
spoiler because we're always checking out the new stuff not
only that scarlet she's free now mass-produced model in its

247
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:12,540
current state it's unbelievable yet despite all that you
both kept fighting most admirable you're right we are

248
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:22,940
admirable at present your body has been completely repaired
and even enhanced oh yeah repaired take it off you're

249
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:31,680
repaired now do you like them we try to replicate them as
closely as we have repaired you you don't need to wear more

250
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:39,180
armor particularly strong they're a bit too light in fact
weight has yeah they're technically robots that's why

251
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:46,940
technically you don't have to feed them technological
advances begin with improvements in weight even so they feel

252
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:54,360
far too light and seem to like and i feel like i'm telling
you they're not android cyborgs me up with additional

253
00:22:54,360 --> 00:23:00,840
weapons and ammunition Finally succeeded in increasing
performance while reducing weight.

254
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,480
What's the point of making it heavier again?

255
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,720
The more weapons, the better.

256
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,620
Oh, I like her.

257
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,000
Fine.

258
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:09,820
Road me up to the limit.

259
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,640
As you wish.

260
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:12,900
Thank you.

261
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:13,280
Yeah.

262
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:13,640
Oh, yeah.

263
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:14,780
So, yeah, side boy.

264
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,680
How are Scarlet and Rapunzel?

265
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,200
I managed to keep them alive.

266
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,500
Strictly speaking, their brains are being housed in the
brain shelter.

267
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:25,880
More DPS.

268
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,040
Their bodies are beyond repair.

269
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:38,280
and cannot be used that's a relief then when will they
receive their new bodies that won't be possible what what

270
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:45,780
eden doesn't possess the technology to manufacture nikes i
don't understand wait how then what have you been doing all

271
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:53,840
this time yeah what's your job repair pre-existing bodies
but creating one from scratch is beyond our capabilities

272
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,580
it's similar to how the arc handles Oh my god, we gotta call
an emergency.

273
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,080
We gotta transport them to another country.

274
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:05,260
However, I was merely an MMR researcher.

275
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,460
There was no way I could smuggle out Nikkei production
technology on top of everything else.

276
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,500
That technology is entirely monopolized by the big three.

277
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,400
So, what happens now?

278
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,160
We'll have to obtain it from the Ark.

279
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,300
We gotta go to the Ark?

280
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,400
That guy is making his way to Eden.

281
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:32,800
I'm planning to have him request the Ark to transfer Nikkei
production technology to us.

282
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,040
And you're okay with doing that?

283
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,640
Of course I'm not okay with it.

284
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,780
It hurts both my pride and feelings.

285
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,880
The same applies to Johan, obviously.

286
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:49,820
However, during our battle against the Queen, I realized
something.

287
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:56,860
We should have set aside our bullheaded pride and
conviction, and just focused on becoming stronger.

288
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:06,100
if we had shared our technology with you and learned yours
in return things might have turned out a lot differently

289
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:17,960
it's something I regret though at this point such insights
are pointless I feel the same way I took the Queen too

290
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:26,560
lightly I thought of her as something that existed literally
the rapture and i figured that would be enough she's not

291
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:36,200
real i regret it can't be real if we obtain the nike
production technology from the ark noah can be restored as

292
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:47,700
well we can only hope what about heran and isabel are they
okay oh i'm sorry oh no it is we still have their brains

293
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:55,700
right those two i never thought i would say we still have
their brains right they went out like true goddesses we we

294
00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:11,460
still said the line guys we can regrow the brain and we have
one of them right we can truly we can regrow the brain

295
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:14,320
thanks for everything you've done

296
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:23,450
bed and stairs at the ceilings.

297
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:25,430
Her thoughts are all over the place.

298
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:30,350
However, the mental turmoil soon settles, condensing in
there a single thought.

299
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:32,330
Kill the queen.

300
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:36,010
The one who desecrated a beautiful white flower, Lilis.

301
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:39,350
Kill the queen, no matter what.

302
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:43,630
Still white, close to her eyes and falls asleep.

303
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:49,170
For some reason, she feels like she's about to dream of the
past.

304
00:26:51,810 --> 00:27:09,290
oh that's me that's me guys wait is that snow white wait oh
is this one this is like back in the the past see i lived oh

305
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:19,970

nike veterans How do you access the storyline view before we

306
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:20,770

307
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:23,510
A hundred years?

308
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:24,950
A hundred years ago?

309
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:29,050
I assume it's campaign, right?

310
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:34,010
Okay, it's...

311
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:35,810
I want to know.

312
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:37,570
It's in the archives.

00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:40,050
Oh, it's under campaign.

314
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:41,750
Outpost.

315
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:42,750
Oh, it's outpost.

316
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:43,150
Okay.

317
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:44,850

storyline oh okay we got it so we are supposed to look at
all of these too.

323
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:20,690
I almost forgot about this part.

324
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:23,510
So we can understand, like, what's going on.

325
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:30,510
We might get them back some Nymphide Repuzzle, aka Doki.

326
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:31,650

332
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:40,650

Oh.

334
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:45,190

381
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,500
A scent of the bakery.

382
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,280
Whoa.

383
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:20,620

my God.

385
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:26,920
She's humming.

386
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,160
Oh, that's good.

00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:50,320

hometown

389
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,020

390
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,280
Come here.

391
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,960
Oh my god, she's small white.

392
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,720
Red Hood, I can't breathe.

393
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,660
Could you turn that down?

394
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,400
What was that I just heard?

395
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:37,180
Surely it couldn't be someone interrupting this fine song
I'm listening to.

396
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,130
The friends I miss.

397
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:45,010
Even the sky above us is forever gray.

398
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:48,070
return to our hometown someday.

399
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:50,350
It's positively effervescent, right?

400
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:54,610
I feel like I'm getting older just listening to it.

401
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,430
What do you want about?

402
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:03,350
Besides, most things in life are like a fine wine and only
get better with age.

403
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:07,050
At any rate, what brought you over here to see me?

404
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,210
I doubt it was because you missed me.

405
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:13,290
Did you come to borrow my nudie mag?

406
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,450
Whoa, what?

407
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:24,390
Wait, Absolutely not Yeah, I'm gonna be like That's a child
So what you mean is that you'll be super into it later Wait,

408
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:26,430
so Okay, what?

409
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:30,610
Okay, I'm actually curious So they're all brains, right?

410
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:32,690
They're all brains So why is she?

411
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:50,070
So does that mean like She's They got a brain of A child And
then like She's like And then it grows up or like does she

412
00:34:50,070 --> 00:35:03,010
does she get like because it's like robots right so like you
know when she gets older do they just like add boobs so so

413
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:11,770
it's no way that's no way like transfer like her brain to to
that body when she was a child and then they're like well a

414
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:15,270
hundred years past so technically You're not longer a child
anymore.

415
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:18,890
So we gotta modify your bot.

416
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:22,090
Because we gotta get some upgrades going on.

417
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:22,350
Right?

418
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:25,150
It's called upgrades.

419
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:25,750
You're right.

420
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:27,810
So today, upgrade their bodies.

421
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:31,070
I think I've got a good idea of what he's going to say.

422
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:34,670
Oh, so they can grow.

423
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:41,490
Okay, because I'm like wondering, like, how did we get her
from, like, how did we go from that to her?

424
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:43,030
To heavy arms.

425
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:47,610
It's just a friendly hug Call it what you want.

426
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:56,210
I'm just curious Because those two seem like not the same
people Like the tip the two show whites they don't seem like

427
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:57,070
the same person

428
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:13,670
Hmm are you two practicing pro wrestling whoa you apparently
have too much time on your hands It's not what you think

429
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:17,370
That's so, Sindade.

430
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:18,410
That's me!

431
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:19,210
Are you guys wrestling?

432
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:22,410
There's never a dull moment with you two.

433
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:22,750
That's me.

434
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,210
It's so accurate, too.

435
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:25,350
That's not what we're doing.

436
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:35,410
If I may throw in my two cents, wrestling isn't a
particularly useful martial arts discipline against

437
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:36,030
raptures.

438
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:40,050
Devoting your time to practicing it will be of little value.

439
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:42,690
We're not wrestling!

440
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:47,650
Oh, wrestling, eh?

441
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:57,030
that headlock of yours isn't too sturdy Red Hood I've got a
few years you could check out for reference if you'd like

442
00:36:57,030 --> 00:37:09,070
Lilith Red Hood is bullying me no I'm not we're practicing
pro wrestling that's what Red Hood said how many times do I

443
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:20,650
have to say that this isn't wrestling wait what is it then
what are we doing it was not like what are we doing is that

444
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:30,410
me so am i to take it that red hood is picking on you hey i
would never pick on our precious little snow white oh that's

445
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:37,450
command oh that's not me that's everyone bro he should be
called commander b or something so i can know which one

446
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:51,110
commander a and commander b up to you is that everyone oh
that's the commander before i took over that's the legendary

447
00:37:51,110 --> 00:38:06,890

00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:15,470

supposed to be a team if you want us to be chummy then let's

449
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:20,950
have a group meal the last time we all hung out and had some
grub.

450
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:23,750
Well, we all ate together just last week.

451
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:32,370
Yeah, like, we already ate, like, a week ago.

452
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:33,630
Why are we gonna eat again?

453
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:34,810
That's so true.

454
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:37,210
Yo, preach that's so true.

455
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:39,650
Why do we need to feed our Nikes more food?

456
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,270
I don't remember anything.

457
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:45,630
I thought you were pretending to black out so you didn't
have to pay the bill.

458
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:47,390
I agree.

459
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:55,750
i'm not that kind of person if the commander was yeah if the
commander was so great and he was so legendary why is he

00:38:55,750 --> 00:39:04,130
dead i've turned over yeah and why i'm still alive everyone

463
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:21,430
Not yet.

464
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:22,910
When are we going to commence the briefing?

465
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:26,050
Wait, this was 100 years ago?

466
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:27,030
Why is he alive?

467
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:27,950
Wait a minute.

468
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:30,470
Okay, wait, wait, okay.

469
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:33,810
Wasn't this 100 years ago?

470
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:35,310
How is he alive?

471
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:40,390
Wait a minute.

472
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,910
Wait a minute.

473
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:49,890
They have the technology.

474
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:53,030
They can rebuild him

475
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:03,900
Alright Since we know the chronological Okay I unlocked this
area Oh wait what's the minigame?

476
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:12,060
This is more important Let's move out The archive doesn't
support the minigame No don't say that That's a battle

477
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:19,480
simulation I love the minigame parts Did they put his brain
in a jar too?

478
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,040
I thought that was served for the women

479
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,980
tends to break the game's balance.

480
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:30,900
Fair enough.

481
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,940
As for the commander, yes?

482
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,600
Well, you know, no need to spell it out.

483
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:36,620
I get what you're trying to say.

484
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,980
The commander's fighting skills are...

485
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,380
Yeah, I know, right?

486
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,420
It's so...

487
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,580
Oh, is this the vampire survivors?

488
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,600
Alright, did you make this all by yourself?

489
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:48,360
Even the artwork?

490
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:48,980
Yes.

491
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,100
Oh, my gosh.

492
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,580
No, I drew all of this.

493
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,020
What's all your character in game, though?

494
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:58,440
Huh?

495
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,160
All the others look fairly similar, but your character looks
way different.

496
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,700
How can I put this?

497
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:07,440
She feels a bit harboring, like some battle-hardened war
dog.

498
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:12,080
Add an easy mode to it, so you don't need a super invested
account to catch up to now or possibly ever.

499
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,320
Calm down, thank you for the super chat.

500
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:13,840
Thank you, thank you.

501
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:20,200
Yeah, I saw that, but I was wondering, do you still get,
like, the same rewards for it?

502
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,320
Or, like, do you get less rewards if you do the easy mode?

503
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,680
I'm getting warm, aren't I?

504
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,940
I knew it's only natural for someone your age to be enamored
with a character like that.

505
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:39,540
I'm looking for seeing how you get along So are you going to
spot off bad as one lies Like if you believe that in the

506
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:49,660
creator you better start playing Oh no rewards Okay I'll
still play the regular then Let me play snow white Yeah why

507
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,400
are you getting upset for it?

508
00:41:51,560 --> 00:42:03,200
Let me play Alright Memory of goddess where you destroy a
rapture swarm Oh Oh my god I can never escape roguelites Tap

509
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,280
and drag to move.

510
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:08,820
Use the weapons equipped by the characters to attack
enemies.

511
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,340
You're defeated when a character's HP is depleted.

512
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:12,620
Guys, I could never escape.

513
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:16,940
I always find a way to play a roguelike.

514
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,720
You can choose an item from the...

515
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,460
You can choose an item you own.

516
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,460
The item will level up.

517
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:24,240
When killing raptures, attract all of them.

518
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:25,280
Alright, here we go.

519
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,020
We gotta start.

520
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,360
Alright.

521
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,800
Oh, I can only do one.

522
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,480
Oh, I can play a Snow White.

523
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,260
Um, I assume, yeah, I can only do one.

524
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,240
How do I... What is this?

525
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,060
Like...

526
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,820
What is this thing?

527
00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:59,930
Okay, reflector, rapid movement.

528
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:03,350
Oh, is that like...

529
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:09,260
Oh, tap... Oh, that's... Oh, that's a D-pad!

530
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:09,740
Okay.

531
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:11,640
Let's see.

532
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,560
Enhances increases.

533
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,200
Speed is...

534
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,200
Get the reflector?

535
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:22,640
Okay.

536
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:23,980
I'll grab the reflector.

537
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:28,260
Oh, shit.

538
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,320
Wait, that's insane.

539
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,640
Oh, I got the dog tag, too.

540
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:34,960
Nice.

541
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,800
Maudin has his defense.

542
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:40,340
That fires that nearby.

543
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,400
I'll get weapon.

544
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,040
Stronger.

545
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:46,820
Stronger weapon.

546
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:48,500
Remember what Snow White said?

547
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,800
More weapons, more strong.

548
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,360
Energy sword.

549
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:55,700
I don't really want...

550
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:56,620
I'm going to grab the sword.

551
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,480
So they can't get close to me.

552
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:01,180
Just in case.

553
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,300
I don't know what build I'm doing.

554
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:06,760
I don't know what build I'm doing, but...

555
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,760
You know, maybe it'll work.

556
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:08,560
You don't know that.

557
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:09,840
Maybe it'll work, guys.

558
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,160
Ooh, level two?

559
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:17,640
I'll grab my gun more.

560
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:20,280
Will that free will take rain.

561
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,100
We got this.

562
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,320
Oh, can we go?

563
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:27,480
More DPS.

564
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:28,740
More win.

565
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:29,720
More shrog.

566
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,840
Practically doing the least no white build.

567
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,200
Grenade.

568
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:38,260
I don't need defense.

569
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:40,260
No, I'll do beef a bit faster.

570
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,700
Just so I can grab my money more.

571
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,100
It's not janky.

572
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,900
Guys, this is peak.

573
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,300
I'm theory crafting right now.

574
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:52,840
I'm literally theory crafting boomerang.

575
00:44:53,120 --> 00:45:02,740
Wait I could get the oh projectile speed is always good But
can I turn up the speed how oh tab oh okay.

576
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,920
Yeah, we're just gonna turn up the speed Uh projectile
speed.

577
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:11,020
Oh my god, it's so fast now Wait, I like that feature.

578
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:12,340
That's very smart.

579
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,300
I like that There we go.

580
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:18,660
Oh, oh, that's the fastest I can go.

581
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:20,340
No, I wanted to be even faster.

582
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:24,520
Uh, HP enhancement, submachine gun.

583
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:26,200
We'll grab HP.

584
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:30,900
Having more HP is like having defense if you think about it.

585
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:33,820
It's literally the same thing.

586
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:36,760
We'll grab.

587
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:38,880
Grab the money.

588
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:42,300
What's this?

589
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:45,280
Smash model after Puzzle spins and creates an energy.

590
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:45,620
G-Sphere.

591
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:46,880
I'll just do more reflector.

592
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:50,320
I think I have enough, like, attack stuff anyway.

593
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:52,360
Whoa!

594
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:54,200
Okay, these guys go so fast.

595
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:55,800
It messes with me.

596
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:57,220
Ooh, that... Oh, wait.

597
00:45:59,120 --> 00:45:59,680
Yeah.

598
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:01,560
You can grab items easier.

599
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,300
Oh, what's this?

600
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:03,020
Oh!

601
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:03,920
That's a nuke!

602
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:06,400
That was the nuke.

603
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:11,800
Watch me become the next.

604
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:15,780
The next...

605
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:17,180
What game is this even called?

606
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,940
I don't even know.

607
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:21,060
I don't even know what game they made.

608
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:22,700
They called this mini-game.

609
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:24,300
Size.

610
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:24,840
Oh, wait.

611
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:25,640
Oh, whoa.

612
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,240
Oh, that spooked me.

613
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:32,040
Okay.

614
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:33,420
Okay.

615
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,280
Wait, that's the boss.

616
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:35,660
We're about to kill the boss.

617
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:37,360
It's just chilling there.

618
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:39,720
Okay.

619
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,380
There you go.

620
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,240
It's almost dead.

621
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:47,220
Oh, man.

622
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:48,200
Memory of Goddess?

623
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:48,840
Okay.

624
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:53,180
I will hit the high score of Memory of Goddess.

625
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,320
Stop running away!

626
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:56,920
Let me kill you!

627
00:46:58,580 --> 00:46:59,140
Yeah.

628
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:01,940
Nice!

629
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:03,960
I got the big, big one.

630
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:05,760
What did I get?

631
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,540
Goddamn tactical rifle?

632
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:11,060
Oh my god, I'm shooting everywhere now.

633
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:15,420
Okay, oops.

634
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:17,280
Okay, oops.

635
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:19,160
I deserve that.

636
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:20,360
I ran into that.

637
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:21,440
Alright, fine.

638
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:24,420
I'll grab defense since it's here anyway.

639
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:26,620
No, I didn't mean to take the HP.

640
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:27,500
It's so tiny.

641
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,340
The heart is so tiny.

642
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:31,140
Okay.

643
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:34,180
Wait, I have ult?

644
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:35,700
How do I ult?

645
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:41,550
What button is ult?

646
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:45,030
Oh!

647
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:47,050
Wait, what does my ult do?

648
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:50,890
What does my ult even do?

649
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:54,730
Oh, whoops.

650
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:57,670
I might need actual attacks now.

651
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:02,420
Oh, it's just...

652
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:03,680
I just shoot stuff everywhere.

653
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:05,480
Okay, rapid fire, yeah.

654
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:07,800
I figured out what my ult does.

655
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,120
I'll do grenade.

656
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,840
Let's start chucking stuff.

657
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:15,920
Nice.

658
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:19,980
You have to get close to me.

659
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:23,680
Alright.

660
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,520
We're good to go.

661
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,040
You can't surround me.

662
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:30,440
I'm fast as fuck, boy.

663
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:34,460
Alright, I actually need to grab some stuff, though, here.

664
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:35,480
Oh, gosh.

665
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:37,140
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

666
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:38,000
Chill, everyone.

667
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:41,480
Whoa.

668
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:42,780
Whoa, whoa, everyone.

669
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:43,580
Calm down.

670
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:44,360
Calm down.

671
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:44,900
Don't worry.

672
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I'll kill you soon.

673
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:47,300
Don't worry.

674
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:47,920

That's really cute.

779
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:55,980
I'm just a dog tag.

780
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,180
I just got it.

781
00:55:58,140 --> 00:55:59,200
It's just a dog tag.

What are you so happy about?

783
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:03,880
Because it means that now I'm officially a member of the
goddess squad.

784
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:08,520
You do realize what dog tags are meant to be used for,
right?

785
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:16,820

there's something else you're forgetting when we're on the

786
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:22,380

There's no way it can block a goddamn missile right here.

792
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:47,840
You're messing with me.

793

00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:52,680
A missile's a missile.

00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:57,820

838
00:59:27,490 --> 00:59:29,670
there yet been any word from Lilith Or the commander

839
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:42,760
not yet no I am worried it is the first time we've
experienced what about a little power guys I doubt there'll

840
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:51,600
be any trouble not with those two that may be true but
considering the circumstances we've been staying in contact

841
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:59,240
with the United Forces of humanity or rather the central
government they're saying something unexpected came up so

842
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:04,820
it's hard to get in touch with them right now for We'll just
have to take their word for it.

843
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:05,680
All right.

844
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,700
And should they still fail to make their appearance?

845
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:08,340
Where's me?

846
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:09,520
Where's no one?

847
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:13,340
I mean, there's me here, but where's other me?

848
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:14,640
That's rather bold of you.

849
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:16,420
You said it yourself.

850
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:20,420
In light of the current situation, those two are
indispensable.

851
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:25,300
It's obvious the authorities are hamstringing them with
political nonsense again.

852
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:29,500
If they're just stalling, we should get both of them out
ourselves.

853
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:32,440
Me thinks thou hast roused the slumbering beast.

854
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:33,820
God, it's the...

855
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:35,480
That was how it's thought.

856
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:36,700
Very well.

857
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:39,800
If the interim chieftain sayeth so, I have no quarrel.

858
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:41,340
It's the ye old English.

859
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:44,820
It makes us sound like a motley crew of mountain bandits.

860
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:48,300
Alas, this is a most vexing matter indeed.

861
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:55,080
Though they did not partake in the battle against Anachiro,
that they have not so much as revealed their visages till

862
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:57,260
now is an offense most unpardonable.

863
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:01,500
Should they present themselves, I shall chastise them
soundly.

864
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:09,660
exactly are you planning to scold them you've already been
slammed into the floor and ceiling there's nowhere left for

865
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:18,860
you to get lodged in she called you weak girl speaking of
anachiro i have a feeling there's more than one heretic i

866
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:26,540
agree who's the other heritage such a notion those are
fusion experiments i saw in labs me after i read one

867
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:34,380
shakespeare book yeah she's a media kid for sure fusing
Nikes with raptures.

868
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:37,740
Anna Chiro must have been their first successful creation.

869
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:43,760
And considering how much she's accomplished, there's no way
they would stop it, only one.

870
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:53,320
Frankly, if three additional heretics like Anna Chiro, no,
even just two were to show up, humanity wouldn't stand a

871
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:53,820
chance.

872
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:54,440
Oh no, we wouldn't do.

873
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:57,400
That's precisely why we need Lilith and the commander.

874
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:02,180
They're steadily growing stronger while we're over here
wearing ourselves down.

875
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:08,180
Unless something big happens that can turn the tide,
humanity is doomed.

876
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:10,500
What manner of talk is this?

877
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,840
Did we not achieve victory even without the two of them?

878
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:15,840
Did they get a brain from, like, someone from the 1500s?

879
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:17,760
But we had Red Hood with us.

880
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:19,900
Why does she talk like that?

881
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:21,920
Doth thy heart yet yearn for her?

882
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:22,900
Yes.

883
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:28,140
If they dig up someone from the medieval times, and then,
like, put that brain in her?

884
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:31,640
She's shown brilliantly and departed of her own free will
with no regrets.

885
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:42,700
becoming to linger in such moping moping yeah that's what
i'm seeing have maintained a most admirable compote oh she's

886
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:53,820
just chewy does she remain as she was yes she spends all her
time in the workshop and barely comes out i suppose she

887
01:02:53,820 --> 01:03:00,960
still hasn't gotten over it i can understand how she was
gonna be the poem it's never easy to forget those we've lost

888
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:12,000
especially why did we say the pope to war why it's only
natural she feels this way oh I was sending the pope to war

889
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:21,840
since we can't truly know what it feels like to lose someone
so precious I know well how it feels I need must have a word

890
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:31,900
with her leave her be she volunteered aren't thou so soon
forgetful of thy own utterance we require every able-bodied

891
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:35,200
soul gather forthwith, even if just one.

892
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:41,160
Though it may strike harsh, now is assuredly not the hour
for succumbing to despondency.

893
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:45,220
So must I press them onward, even by force if need be?

894
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:48,500
I shall take upon myself the part of villain.

895
01:03:49,180 --> 01:03:49,560
Alright.

896
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:51,420
You go, girl.

897
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:53,080
I'll leave that to you.

898
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:56,060
I'm not confident when it comes to such things.

899
01:03:56,980 --> 01:03:57,120
Huh.

900
01:03:57,740 --> 01:03:58,660
Me thought as much.

901
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:00,380
What do you mean by that?

902
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:02,440
She called her stupid.

903
01:04:03,060 --> 01:04:04,780
He's like, what do you mean by that?

904
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:05,740
Gotta go!

905
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,740
She's like, I guess I gotta go to my mission now.

906
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:14,780
Watch this.

907
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:16,360
Oh, you don't have to.

908
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,240
See, guys, I'm gaming right now.

909
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:21,840
One moment, please.

910
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:23,700
That's me doing it.

911
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:25,060
Whoa, yeah, yeah.

912
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:26,980
Train services will not be interrupted.

913
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:28,200
Whoa.

914
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:34,020
What do you mean?

915
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:35,660
Did you not see my cursor move?

916
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:37,240
We have arrived at your destination.

917
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:38,080
I did it.

918
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:40,220
It's been a pleasure escorting you here safely.

919
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:41,100
So good.

920
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:44,480
You not see my cursor move?

921
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:50,480
Is there any within?

922
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:55,260
No, it's a lie.

923
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,400
Oh, wait, my cursor doesn't show up.

924
01:04:58,340 --> 01:05:03,440
I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, my cursor actually doesn't
show up.

925
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:17,920
oh this situation doth offer scant hope onto my heart and
grips the hilt of your sword preparing to strike the door

926
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:19,460
with even greater force

927
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:38,040
wait i have an idea i'm coming oh that's me other me yeah
because like she's still a child but like like the others

928
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:45,680
stay the same she literally got upgraded that's precisely
what i was going to ask you what in the world are you doing

929
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:52,460
well that's a strong-ass kid though what possessed thee to
fling the door wide open so suddenly because they didn't

930
01:05:52,460 --> 01:06:01,640
change her when they got older had thou opened it sooner no
harm would have befallen any uh what is it what do you want

931
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:14,960
hmm come let us enter is so cute he's like hey hey wait at
least let me make some room for you

932
01:06:18,510 --> 01:06:25,670
steps begin to falter the spaceship's workshop is cluttered
with countless tools and weapons leaving barely any space to

933
01:06:25,670 --> 01:06:33,210
walk eventually scarlet stops you could have told me you
were coming to visit yeah had i done so thou wouldest have

934
01:06:33,210 --> 01:06:38,930
striven to avoid me what i've heard from Dorothy.

935
01:06:40,050 --> 01:06:45,910
Since the departure of the Red Hood, thou has sequestered
thyself within the workshop, refusing to leave for the wolf.

936
01:06:45,970 --> 01:06:46,770
She's a neat noun.

937
01:06:46,910 --> 01:06:53,050
I do not claim to ken what lieth within my heart, yet now is
not the time for... Aw.

938
01:06:54,950 --> 01:06:56,330
She became a neat.

939
01:07:03,130 --> 01:07:05,750
Mankins dressed in them are strangely familiar.

940
01:07:05,870 --> 01:07:06,930
Oh my god, wait, what?

941
01:07:07,950 --> 01:07:09,970
Her gaze never leaving the outfits.

942
01:07:10,130 --> 01:07:20,150
Oh my god, like friends oh no i was planning on showing them
to you once they were finished oh okay no she didn't make

943
01:07:20,150 --> 01:07:26,530

944
01:07:26,530 --> 01:07:39,530

was like some wilson you know where she she painted a

945
01:07:39,530 --> 01:07:48,550
volleyball with a face on it like you're my new friend how
splendid do you like it oh very much so like an engineer

946
01:07:48,550 --> 01:07:57,430
like armory i'm glad but what possessed thee to make these
well the battle's going to get a lot tougher from here on

947
01:07:57,430 --> 01:08:02,970
out i don't think they expected the war to last a hundred
years we don't know when lilith will return and there could

948
01:08:02,970 --> 01:08:14,590
be another heretic like anachiro out there we have to be
ready snow white why are you looking at me in despair then

949
01:08:15,570 --> 01:08:24,290
hmm what i am filled with sorrow i miss red hood i miss her
so much already see she's such a suitor right all red hood

950
01:08:24,290 --> 01:08:32,210

terms i can't afford to wallow in despair aren't thou

951
01:08:32,210 --> 01:08:47,510
burying that sorrow deep within thy bosom and continuing on
wait what wait oh wait no no by auto wait like rewind what

952
01:08:47,510 --> 01:09:00,470
did you just say scarler excuse me far too much as a child
and unfairly so in her where pause never mind think not of

953
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:11,850
it okay where is it art thou bring that that sword deep
within that bosom in any case about these attire i'm 12.

954
01:09:12,210 --> 01:09:13,950
one of dorothy and I'm 13.

955
01:09:14,490 --> 01:09:15,570
Sorry, you two, I have not 12.

956
01:09:15,690 --> 01:09:16,250
I'm not 12.

957
01:09:16,550 --> 01:09:16,950
I'm 13.

958
01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:18,930
Uh, yes.

959
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:22,950
I figured I should start with the ones that have the highest
priority.

960
01:09:23,710 --> 01:09:24,190
Low.

961
01:09:25,230 --> 01:09:30,510
By those very words, thou dost acknowledge that I surpass
Dorothy in strength.

962
01:09:31,190 --> 01:09:31,270
Same.

963
01:09:32,190 --> 01:09:32,190
Yeah.

964
01:09:32,390 --> 01:09:33,310
Fine, just.

965
01:09:33,410 --> 01:09:37,990
But if thou were to attend first to us, how sorely
disappointed would the others be?

966
01:09:38,770 --> 01:09:43,370
Uh, I actually started with the ones who take the most
damage.

967
01:09:43,390 --> 01:09:50,650
or are frequently injured oh is that red hood hmm oh wait
that's what she made it for start yeah i'm gonna say it is

968
01:09:50,650 --> 01:09:58,410
no matter all is well she's like okay i'm sure whose
foolishly large firearm be that none among us would write to

969
01:09:58,410 --> 01:10:05,090
be fair she has a sword like of course she's gonna take the
most damage that's i made a promise to someone like the

970
01:10:05,090 --> 01:10:13,230
scheme is about shooting things and yet she has a sword
working on it whenever i can hmm though the recipient

971
01:10:13,390 --> 01:10:17,830
remains unknown to me, yet they are the luckiest soul in all
the world.

972
01:10:18,450 --> 01:10:22,810
To be the beneficiary of a weapon crafted by the most
accomplished artisan.

973
01:10:24,830 --> 01:10:26,030
You flatter me.

974
01:10:29,010 --> 01:10:29,730
There you are.

975
01:10:30,150 --> 01:10:30,630
There I am.

976
01:10:30,650 --> 01:10:31,410
That was quick.

977
01:10:32,010 --> 01:10:34,970
You did get a chance to talk some sense into her, right?

978
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:36,150
Huh.

979
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:40,670
This won't do.

980
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:43,290
As the acting leader, I'll...

981
01:10:43,390 --> 01:10:51,030
Thou shall not treat snow white as a child but she is me why
are you yelling all of a sudden but she is a child into you

982
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:56,370
Snow white is snow white is Is that why she got upgrades?

983
01:10:56,870 --> 01:11:04,390

01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:31,760
Oh, she got eliminated because Red Hood gave her dirty mags.

1008
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:36,260
What's with the delay?

1009
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:36,820
Ping!

1010
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:37,300
Ping!

1011
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:38,720
It's just ping, guys.

1012
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:39,720
It's just ping.

1013
01:13:43,490 --> 01:13:45,790
Oh, hey.

1014
01:13:46,510 --> 01:14:00,370
British lady is Lily West you're awake commander where are
we we're in the repair center hmm so what do you think is

1015
01:14:00,370 --> 01:14:08,970
the central government's repair facility any different
softer beds perhaps or maybe the air is cleaner all hospital

1016
01:14:08,970 --> 01:14:19,890
rooms are the same that is not true it depends on where you
get going That's if it's a private or public hospital, too.

1017
01:14:20,910 --> 01:14:22,430
And if you have insurance or not.

1018
01:14:22,450 --> 01:14:23,090
What did they say?

1019
01:14:23,830 --> 01:14:25,230
Wait, do Nikes have insurance?

1020
01:14:25,530 --> 01:14:28,250
How much time do I have left?

1021
01:14:29,210 --> 01:14:29,670
I don't know.

1022
01:14:30,290 --> 01:14:31,130
What's wrong with my brain?

1023
01:14:31,450 --> 01:14:32,710
You could live another hundred years.

1024
01:14:33,410 --> 01:14:34,730
Don't joke around.

1025
01:14:35,610 --> 01:14:37,250
I'm just trying to hold on to hope.

1026
01:14:38,090 --> 01:14:39,310
Hope is important.

1027
01:14:40,150 --> 01:14:40,870
Do we need insurance?

1028
01:14:41,190 --> 01:14:41,210
Maybe.

1029
01:14:41,930 --> 01:14:43,470
Less if you push yourself too hard.

1030
01:14:43,490 --> 01:14:43,970
Less?

1031
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:44,910
Half a year?

1032
01:14:45,290 --> 01:14:46,430
What does she have?

1033
01:14:46,510 --> 01:14:48,530
So there's really no other way.

1034
01:14:48,710 --> 01:14:49,630
Wait, what does she have?

1035
01:14:49,770 --> 01:14:50,470
She's a...

1036
01:14:50,470 --> 01:14:51,430
She's a Niki.

1037
01:14:56,690 --> 01:14:58,050
What does she have?

1038
01:14:58,190 --> 01:14:59,110
Why is she dying?

1039
01:14:59,290 --> 01:15:00,390
There's no cure?

1040
01:15:02,210 --> 01:15:03,910
Does she have terminal?

1041
01:15:04,350 --> 01:15:05,950
Like, is there something in her brain?

1042
01:15:06,370 --> 01:15:08,450
Does she have, like, tumors growing in her brain?

1043
01:15:08,830 --> 01:15:11,230
They built it without even knowing how to fix it.

1044
01:15:13,670 --> 01:15:15,550
Her body is dying?

1045
01:15:15,790 --> 01:15:17,490
Niki's brains have an expiration?

1046
01:15:19,070 --> 01:15:19,590
Oh.

1047
01:15:19,610 --> 01:15:28,810
she didn't yeah i was gonna say she oh she was like
literally the first one oh this body was intended for

1048
01:15:28,810 --> 01:15:34,890
short-term battles after all wait but why can't we just
transfer transport her brain to another nike the problem is

1049
01:15:34,890 --> 01:15:41,430
that the war has dragged on for too long yeah like she
doesn't know there's a hundred more years do you think we'll

1050
01:15:41,430 --> 01:15:51,090
be victorious in six months time not a chance losing though
that's possible as expected Oh, she is the goddess.

1051
01:15:52,190 --> 01:15:53,470
Yeah, transferred the SSC.

1052
01:15:53,770 --> 01:15:56,710
Sure, we're undefeated, but there are fewer than 10 of us in
this squad.

1053
01:15:57,950 --> 01:16:01,410
All we can do now is serve as a symbol of hope for humanity
on the battlefield.

1054
01:16:02,790 --> 01:16:05,010
Well, we certainly pulled that off admirably.

1055
01:16:06,010 --> 01:16:07,830
Yeah, maybe too admirably.

1056
01:16:08,470 --> 01:16:10,410
We've already become the hope of humanity.

1057
01:16:11,410 --> 01:16:12,730
So you've got to stay alive.

1058
01:16:14,110 --> 01:16:15,830
I wish it were that simple.

1059
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:19,230
I expected this.

1060
01:16:19,610 --> 01:16:21,710
But it's happening too quickly.

1061
01:16:22,430 --> 01:16:24,590
I wish I'd left something behind for the others.

1062
01:16:25,790 --> 01:16:26,650
Just leave your brain.

1063
01:16:27,050 --> 01:16:27,310
Yeah.

1064
01:16:28,330 --> 01:16:32,870
When the end starts to draw near, I guess people start
thinking the same things.

1065
01:16:33,490 --> 01:16:36,330
If I were to die tomorrow, I wouldn't care what anyone
thought.

1066
01:16:37,430 --> 01:16:39,070
What's the point in leaving anything behind?

1067
01:16:39,430 --> 01:16:42,150
I'm barely able to take care of my own matters as it is.

1068
01:16:43,170 --> 01:16:44,390
So what would you do?

1069
01:16:44,950 --> 01:16:45,810
Let's see.

1070
01:16:46,710 --> 01:16:49,510
Drink some fine liquor with a beauty on each other.

1071
01:16:50,110 --> 01:16:50,710
Hmm.

1072
01:16:50,950 --> 01:16:51,370
Hmm.

1073
01:16:51,930 --> 01:16:52,170
Yeah.

1074
01:16:54,230 --> 01:16:57,290
While you're flanked by two beautiful women?

1075
01:16:57,510 --> 01:16:57,890
Why not?

1076
01:16:58,390 --> 01:16:59,930
Every story needs an audience.

1077
01:17:00,610 --> 01:17:03,030
I hope that wish of yours comes true.

1078
01:17:03,690 --> 01:17:04,750
I'm gonna try my best.

1079
01:17:05,670 --> 01:17:06,950
So how did the meeting go?

1080
01:17:07,550 --> 01:17:08,890
It hasn't even started yet.

1081
01:17:10,870 --> 01:17:11,330
Not yet.

1082
01:17:11,810 --> 01:17:12,450
Why not three?

1083
01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:13,110
Because you collapsed.

1084
01:17:14,050 --> 01:17:15,670
Is it really necessary for me to attend?

1085
01:17:15,670 --> 01:17:17,370
Why limit yourself, man, if you're dying?

1086
01:17:18,350 --> 01:17:19,090
Why not four?

1087
01:17:19,610 --> 01:17:32,930
had to say too uh i think i know what they're going to bring
up i think you're right only two hours it looks like the end

1088
01:17:32,930 --> 01:17:41,650
is coming yeah there's nothing we can do about that it's
inevitable one can sit on the lap i really don't like it me

1089
01:17:41,650 --> 01:17:51,460
neither too much greed ruins the meal that's good that's
actually good

1090
01:17:58,060 --> 01:17:58,780
Yeah.

1091
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:00,740
Wait, actually I want to know.

1092
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:05,780
All right, I want to try reloading.

1093
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:09,140
Nice.

1094
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Good job, Snow White.

1095
01:18:16,980 --> 01:18:17,320
Yay!

1096
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:19,660
We did it.

1097
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:21,800
Two days later.

1098
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:24,480
She's still alive.

1099
01:18:34,070 --> 01:18:49,850
commander yes may I hit that wall no you can't not until
I've had my turn there are multiple walls oh no meeting was

1100

1102
01:19:11,860 --> 01:19:21,140

thing hope that wasn't a support beam

1104
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:40,840
come back the word commander wore it down

1105
01:19:51,870 --> 01:19:54,830
there expressions change goddess

1106
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:09,160
sad attention salute in perfect unison at ease gentlemen to
need a goddess herself in person what an incredible honor to

1107
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:17,600
truly a great honor indeed it's all this nonsense about
honor what are we a cult my apologies sir it's just such an

1108
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:19,400
It's literally an army.

1109
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:20,500
What the fuck do you mean?

1110
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:23,560
I shall sever this worthless tongue at once.

1111
01:20:23,580 --> 01:20:25,040
I forgot what?

1112
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:26,440
These fanatics are the worst.

1113
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:27,800
I can't stand them.

1114
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:29,220
He didn't even say no.

1115
01:20:29,340 --> 01:20:30,000
He's like, okay.

1116
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:31,380
Bro, stop him.

1117
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:32,800
He's gonna cut his tongue out.

1118
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:33,460
Same here.

1119
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,700
He didn't even stop them.

1120
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:40,400
It's truly an honor to meet the likes of you two who have
always fought on behalf of all humanity.

1121
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:41,200
Jesus.

1122
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:45,320
Well, it's not like we're the only ones fighting.

1123
01:20:46,420 --> 01:20:54,060
Judging by that insignia, you're a platoon leader you're
doing your part too oh no compared to the great work you two

1124
01:20:54,060 --> 01:21:05,580
are doing my contributions are utterly insignificant i'm
pathetic worthless this is exhausting indeed i don't deserve

1125
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:12,280
to be seen by you as to what caused this hole in the wall if
there's been any inconveniences at all please tell me bro

1126
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:14,580
come down no matter what it takes

1127
01:21:17,620 --> 01:21:20,820
Honk and Mecha Destructor came out of nowhere and smashed a
hole in the...

1128
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:21,260
Ow!

1129
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:24,520
Hey, stop pinching me.

1130
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:26,500
Don't you realize how strong you are?

1131
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:28,060
That's more like a vice than a pinch.

1132
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:28,280
He's like, I deserve it.

1133
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:28,940
I'm worthless.

1134
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:30,620
I'm barely a man.

1135
01:21:30,980 --> 01:21:31,840
Can I?

1136
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:32,980
True.

1137
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:35,340
He's seeing his O-Shoot right now.

1138
01:21:36,860 --> 01:21:37,400
Yikes.

1139
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:39,660
Shading to give him a super chat.

1140
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:40,560
Nicky.

1141
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:41,680
Oh.

1142
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:46,940
Oh, JP Dubb is Mecha Gorilla.

1143
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:47,600
That's...

1144
01:21:47,620 --> 01:21:48,940
My lips are sealed.

1145
01:21:50,060 --> 01:21:50,560
Excuse me.

1146
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:52,200
But who told you that?

1147
01:21:53,260 --> 01:21:54,340
No one told me per se.

1148
01:21:54,820 --> 01:21:58,080
But an anonymous person started spreading it on the central
government's intranet.

1149
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:00,800
The central government's intranet.

1150
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:02,260
Hmm.

1151
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:05,180
Oh my god, even emojis?

1152
01:22:05,260 --> 01:22:07,480
Commander, may I have a word with you?

1153
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:09,380
Stop fooling around, Lily Weiss.

1154
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:11,080
We don't have any time to spare.

1155
01:22:12,020 --> 01:22:12,840
Get it together.

1156
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:14,200
We still have work to do.

1157
01:22:14,780 --> 01:22:17,320
I'm leaving this situation in your hands, Platoon Leader.

1158
01:22:22,060 --> 01:22:25,320
If you'll excuse me, I have something to take care of.

1159
01:22:31,210 --> 01:22:32,050
They just leave him.

1160
01:22:32,390 --> 01:22:34,090
They didn't tell him not to cut off his tone.

1161
01:22:35,630 --> 01:22:36,070
He's pacing.

1162
01:22:36,290 --> 01:22:39,630
Before long, they're both practically running down the
corridor.

1163
01:22:40,450 --> 01:22:43,350
The man watches them as they recede into the distance.

1164
01:22:43,910 --> 01:22:44,430
So cool.

1165
01:22:45,490 --> 01:22:46,350
He's so cool.

1166
01:22:48,550 --> 01:22:49,070
He's so cool.

1167
01:22:54,750 --> 01:23:03,210
cool and this is how the commander died yes now it's my turn
to take over oh my gosh i heard there's like what 14

1168
01:23:03,210 --> 01:23:10,430
chapters right all right well i'm getting it's catching up
the power level is catching

1169
01:23:13,930 --> 01:23:21,810
up you want to get caught by the mecca gorilla oh 12 yeah
it's a lot of content for new year they always do that for

1170
01:23:21,810 --> 01:23:26,470
the big updates like there's a lot of content for update
Which makes sense, you know?

1171
01:23:27,170 --> 01:23:27,170
Oh,

1172
01:23:31,810 --> 01:23:31,890
shit.

1173
01:23:32,170 --> 01:23:32,170
Okay.

1174
01:23:36,060 --> 01:23:37,460
I brought a dog to the battlefield.

1175
01:23:41,820 --> 01:23:42,220
Yeah, 12.

1176
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:43,520
And it's only part one, too.

1177
01:23:43,580 --> 01:23:45,060
Because part two is releasing.

1178
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:46,520
And I believe...

1179
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:47,340
Let me check again.

1180
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:50,580
Part two is coming out on...

1181
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:56,420
I don't know if it's follow-up on January 6th, guys.

1182
01:23:56,940 --> 01:23:58,540
This is just part one of the story.

1183
01:24:02,430 --> 01:24:07,830
yeah i made it yeah next week

1184
01:24:11,710 --> 01:24:19,310
oswald watches the stream of people and supplies pour into
the entrance of the ark a line of people stretches on

1185
01:24:19,310 --> 01:24:28,230
endlessly as the supply trucks continue rolling in oswald
suddenly filled with sense of unnews has always has there

1186
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:33,190
always been this many people and this much supplies in this
world It feels like still everything and everyone on the

1187
01:24:33,190 --> 01:24:35,450
entire planet has gathered here.

1188
01:24:36,590 --> 01:24:37,450
Doctor, thank you for the super chat.

1189
01:24:37,630 --> 01:24:38,990
Thank you, thank you for playing Niki.

1190
01:24:39,230 --> 01:24:40,210
Thank you, thank you for the super chat.

1191
01:24:40,330 --> 01:24:40,930
Thank you, thank you.

1192
01:24:40,930 --> 01:24:43,730
Always enjoy playing Niki whenever they ask me.

1193
01:24:44,050 --> 01:24:45,530
I want to check out the new update.

1194
01:24:45,850 --> 01:24:46,670
It's always fun.

1195
01:24:49,510 --> 01:24:53,950
I'm like, actually, every sponsor, I'm learning the lore
little by little.

1196
01:24:58,700 --> 01:24:59,940
Virtual never open again.

1197
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:02,180
Neither from the inside nor from the outside.

1198
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:05,520
enemy's defeat has managed to survive.

1199
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:10,320
The fate of the entire speech sees hinges upon the success
of this operation.

1200
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:16,160
As Oswald thinks of his role as the one responsible for
sealing the ark, the ziziness returns.

1201
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:22,700
On a day of his appointment, he could sense the jealousy
hidden behind the smiles of his peers and superiors who

1202
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:26,360
congratulated him, but such things no longer matter.

1203
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:30,780
Once the ark is sealed, it cannot be reopened, not even from
within.

1204
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:34,160
anyone enter it.

1205
01:25:34,660 --> 01:25:40,620
After the five-step sealing process, those who come seeking
refuge in this utopia will find only silent gates greeting

1206
01:25:40,620 --> 01:25:41,800
them before they perish.

1207
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:44,980
When the time comes, Oswald must shut the doors.

1208
01:25:45,860 --> 01:25:49,160
He will have to turn a blind eye to those who come hoping
for rescue.

1209
01:25:49,260 --> 01:25:51,140
He'll be an executioner.

1210
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:53,460
No, a mass murderer.

1211
01:25:56,460 --> 01:25:58,640
He has always followed orders from above about question.

1212
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:01,780
Even when those orders required him to dirty his hands.

1213
01:26:02,220 --> 01:26:04,920
He never refused or diso- A good soldier always follows
order.

1214
01:26:05,180 --> 01:26:07,020
That's a good soldier right there.

1215
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:12,560
As a result of his work, he has somehow earned the nickname,
Hellhound.

1216
01:26:13,420 --> 01:26:16,040
It is a name far from glorious, yet he feels content.

1217
01:26:16,340 --> 01:26:18,480
After all, it means he is being recognized.

1218
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:25,080
Oswald the Hellhound believes no one is more suited than him
to be in charge of sealing the Ark.

1219
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:28,700
All he has to do is follow orders from his superiors, as he
always has.

1220
01:26:33,580 --> 01:26:35,120
It's supposed to be an easy task.

1221
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:36,040
But then...

1222
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:37,760
There are too many.

1223
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:42,020
I'll look once more at the endless line of people.

1224
01:26:43,060 --> 01:26:45,440
How many people are supposed to be allowed into the Ark?

1225
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:49,040
What percentage of the total population is it?

1226
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:50,780
I'm eating a cough drop.

1227
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:52,560
Not even that.

1228
01:26:52,720 --> 01:26:55,520
Perhaps a single digit or merely a fraction.

1229
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:57,220
And what about the rest?

1230
01:26:57,740 --> 01:26:58,960
What will happen to them?

1231
01:26:59,700 --> 01:27:03,060
Just don't look at their faces so you don't humanize them.

1232
01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:06,680
He sure won't be able to endure much longer.

1233
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:09,720
Everything has been planned by his superiors.

1234
01:27:10,660 --> 01:27:12,340
Everything must proceed as outlined.

1235
01:27:12,780 --> 01:27:15,340
Even contingency measures are already in pity place.

1236
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:18,020
But he is the one who must make the decision.

1237
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:21,080
To abandon the majority of all humankind.

1238
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:26,060
In that moment, he desperate tries to recall who will assist
him in sealing the Ark.

1239
01:27:27,420 --> 01:27:28,460
The goddesses?

1240
01:27:28,460 --> 01:27:29,720
The hope of mankind?

1241
01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:31,320
The goddesses of victory?

1242
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:32,920
He said the thing!

1243
01:27:33,580 --> 01:27:40,000
During the sealing of the Ark, the goddesses will stand
guard as part of Operation Ark Guardian!

1244
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:41,820
That'll do it for now.

1245
01:27:44,340 --> 01:27:45,280
Oh my god!

1246
01:27:45,820 --> 01:27:47,640
They are the Ark Guardian!

1247
01:27:47,940 --> 01:27:48,840
Title jump!

1248
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:54,040
Oswald has been saved by the goddesses more times than you
can count.

1249
01:27:54,860 --> 01:27:55,560
Roll credits!

1250
01:27:56,220 --> 01:27:57,640
Even thousands of times.

1251
01:27:58,200 --> 01:28:02,160
Beginning focus, Oswald takes out his tablet and looks at
the status screen.

1252
01:28:03,580 --> 01:28:04,800
a shadow appears.

1253
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:08,220
But lost in thought, he fails to notice his approach.

1254
01:28:09,460 --> 01:28:14,480
Bane Composer, he stays still for a moment and quickly draws
his guns and points it straight ahead.

1255
01:28:14,620 --> 01:28:14,980
Wow.

1256
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:17,180
Where did this gun come from?

1257
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:19,960
That's so strange.

1258
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:21,300
That's a child.

1259
01:28:22,220 --> 01:28:24,660
Hi, Mr. Are you busy?

1260
01:28:26,540 --> 01:28:27,180
Hello.

1261
01:28:30,780 --> 01:28:32,180
Let's have some fun.

1262
01:28:32,980 --> 01:28:33,380
Okay.

1263
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,500
Sorry, apparently I am I'm back in war, guys.

1264
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:43,100
Yeah, apparently I am.

1265
01:28:43,460 --> 01:28:43,920
Sorry, little kid.

1266
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:46,620
I thought I'd do this war thing for a bit.

1267
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:52,680
That's crazy.

1268
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,600
When they shut the gates, they're like...

1269
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:57,060
They make the goddesses stand there.

1270
01:28:57,140 --> 01:29:00,860
Knowing, like, seeing, like, all the people that they're not
letting in.

1271
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:02,620
This is a truly beautiful story this was.

1272
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:04,980
I am most pleased with it.

1273
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:06,980
Oswald lowers his weapon.

1274
01:29:07,740 --> 01:29:24,120
are you names freesia we met before when red hood saved us
oh hey kid what's your name freesia okay freesia where are

1276
01:29:35,540 --> 01:29:38,260
have to don't have to flex those It's over.

1277
01:29:38,580 --> 01:29:40,220
I do, but it's okay.

1278
01:29:41,380 --> 01:29:43,220
I was able to say goodbye to them.

1279
01:29:44,420 --> 01:29:46,700
They were sick for a long time.

1280
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,960
You don't need to do the pose.

1281
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:51,960
About things we liked.

1282
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:53,280
Oh, this is a red ash.

1283
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:54,020
We didn't like.

1284
01:29:54,780 --> 01:29:56,580
We talked about all sorts of stuff.

1285
01:29:57,720 --> 01:29:58,620
So that's okay.

1286
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:02,340
I'm sure my mom and dad are in a happier place.

1287
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:02,780
Yeah!

1288
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:04,160
Do you have their brains?

1289
01:30:04,280 --> 01:30:05,920
Maybe you can put them in the robot.

1290
01:30:07,980 --> 01:30:09,560
Okay, maybe a cyborg did.

1291
01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:10,000
I remember now.

1292
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:11,520
What is it?

1293
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:14,440
This area is off limits to civilians.

1294
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:16,860
Oh, nothing much.

1295
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:21,960
Gotta show dominance.

1296
01:30:23,780 --> 01:30:24,860
Showed his finger here.

1297
01:30:28,250 --> 01:30:29,470
And that's been folded in half.

1298
01:30:29,870 --> 01:30:30,710
Can you sign here for me?

1299
01:30:31,430 --> 01:30:33,070
You want me to sign it?

1300
01:30:33,710 --> 01:30:33,990
Yes.

1301
01:30:34,390 --> 01:30:35,850
You want, she wants his autograph.

1302
01:30:36,530 --> 01:30:38,650
Looks at the paper, Frisia, is holding out.

1303
01:30:38,790 --> 01:30:39,970
A guardian consent form?

1304
01:30:40,590 --> 01:30:42,410
Why are you giving this to me?

1305
01:30:42,490 --> 01:30:43,810
Wait, he's just got her guardian?

1306
01:30:44,030 --> 01:30:45,170
I want you to be my guardian.

1307
01:30:45,410 --> 01:30:46,330
I should choose you.

1308
01:30:46,650 --> 01:30:46,990
I can't do that.

1309
01:30:47,110 --> 01:30:47,790
Yeah, I was going to say.

1310
01:30:47,810 --> 01:30:51,290
It might be best if you can find someone suitable among
those heading to the ark.

1311
01:30:51,430 --> 01:30:53,230
I don't think that's how it works, little girl.

1312
01:30:53,530 --> 01:30:55,970
You have to let the adults choose the orphan.

1313
01:30:56,310 --> 01:30:56,870
I'm sorry.

1314
01:30:57,390 --> 01:31:00,130
That's how bureaucracy works in this world.

1315
01:31:00,890 --> 01:31:03,730
Everyone who came here with me already has family.

1316
01:31:06,090 --> 01:31:07,650
I mean, they can adopt another.

1317
01:31:08,470 --> 01:31:09,670
There's no limits.

1318
01:31:10,670 --> 01:31:13,370
a mom, a brother, or a sister.

1319
01:31:13,910 --> 01:31:15,330
Not all, don't worry.

1320
01:31:16,530 --> 01:31:17,990
You can be the other sister.

1321
01:31:18,450 --> 01:31:19,890
But I don't have anyone.

1322
01:31:21,430 --> 01:31:23,570
Reverse, yeah, reverse adoption.

1323
01:31:23,930 --> 01:31:28,050
When I showed this to them, all of them had an awkward look
on their face.

1324
01:31:28,190 --> 01:31:30,010
Oh, she did ask them.

1325
01:31:30,010 --> 01:31:31,170
I don't want to make anyone feel put out.

1326
01:31:31,490 --> 01:31:31,850
Oh.

1327
01:31:31,850 --> 01:31:35,790
But they said if I don't have a guardian, I'll be sent to an
orphanage.

1328
01:31:36,510 --> 01:31:37,990
And I don't want that.

1329
01:31:38,570 --> 01:31:39,390
I'm scared.

1330
01:31:40,570 --> 01:31:49,730
even know anyone there so i want you to be my guardian the
random single man i don't know you either yeah he's gonna

1331
01:31:49,730 --> 01:32:08,400
say he doesn't even know her oh that's so sad oh there's no
manual for situations like this he's here's at phrygia this

1332
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:16,440
expression is confident fearless and unwavering against our
reason, feels quite certainly that this girl will be fine.

1333
01:32:16,460 --> 01:32:16,800
I'm sorry.

1334
01:32:17,900 --> 01:32:19,080
I can't be your guardian.

1335
01:32:21,680 --> 01:32:24,400
Bro, she has no family.

1336
01:32:24,580 --> 01:32:26,060
She's like, you'll be fine.

1337
01:32:26,740 --> 01:32:29,280
Bro, Oswald!

1338
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:36,640
Oh my god!

1339
01:32:37,140 --> 01:32:39,420
That's so messed up.

1340
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:45,180
Russell.

1341
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:51,420
Frisia's hands, holding out the paper, tremble ever so
slightly.

1342
01:32:52,240 --> 01:32:54,520
Oswald looks at Frisia once more.

1343
01:32:55,040 --> 01:33:01,840
Her face appears calm, indifferent to success, yet he
notices her shoulders and legs quiver almost imperceptibly.

1344
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:07,380
Oswald thinks of the goddess squad, those who held him up
whenever he was about to fall.

1345
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:10,680
Don't fall for it, Oswald.

1346
01:33:11,260 --> 01:33:12,820
No, don't fall for it.

1347
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:21,920
my god he fell for it present the seal to the administrator

1348
01:33:26,340 --> 01:33:38,420
it should make things easier for you yeah he got baited are
you okay with this what do you mean becoming my guardian

1349
01:33:38,420 --> 01:33:48,440
look it was it was messed up that he was like no but then
the fact that he didn't stick with it you know you should

1350
01:33:48,440 --> 01:34:07,440
might as well like he gave her trauma by saying no first you
know well i'm not sure either thanks mr truly thank you i'm

1351
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:10,220
truly so grateful Oh.

1352
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:13,720
Can I stay here by your side for a while?

1353
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,500
He's just like, oh, what do I do?

1354
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:16,900
The child's crying.

1355
01:34:17,320 --> 01:34:18,000
I'll be quiet.

1356
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:19,620
I won't say anything.

1357
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:22,820
Go and submit that document to the administrator.

1358
01:34:24,020 --> 01:34:24,980
Oh, right.

1359
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:26,900
I'll be right back.

1360
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:28,800
That won't be necessary.

1361
01:34:33,460 --> 01:34:34,980
Oh my god, he stepped up.

1362
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:38,140
He messed with her for a little bit, though.

1363
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:39,760
He messed with her a little bit.

1364
01:34:40,660 --> 01:34:45,100
I mean, like, JK, No, JK, haha, I guess I'll adopt you.

1365
01:34:50,780 --> 01:34:52,100
Three figures approach from afar.

1366
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:53,040
How are you, special agent?

1367
01:34:53,480 --> 01:34:54,260
Sorry, chief.

1368
01:34:54,940 --> 01:34:55,400
I'm good.

1369
01:34:56,140 --> 01:34:56,780
What's the matter?

1370
01:34:57,460 --> 01:34:58,440
Oh, nothing serious.

1371
01:34:58,920 --> 01:35:04,500
This child brought a guardian consent form bearing your
signature and seal, so I wanted to stop by to verify it.

1372
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:06,860
I'm telling you it's true.

1373
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:09,180
He signed it and stamped it himself.

1374
01:35:10,040 --> 01:35:14,340
Putting aside her current plight, we plan to launch an
investigation regarding this forgery.

1375
01:35:15,680 --> 01:35:18,120
I was the one who signed it and stamped it.

1376
01:35:18,740 --> 01:35:20,680
Yes, we'll be sure to be thorough in our investment.

1377
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:22,860
I beg your pardon.

1378
01:35:23,700 --> 01:35:26,780
I signed and stamped those documents myself.

1379
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:27,800
Damn.

1380
01:35:28,700 --> 01:35:30,040
You did?

1381
01:35:30,740 --> 01:35:31,500
That's correct.

1382
01:35:32,860 --> 01:35:34,780
See, I told you it's true.

1383
01:35:34,860 --> 01:35:38,500
I was going to say, how would this orphan forge this thing?

1384
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:41,100
Forge a government signature and stamp.

1385
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:43,100
However...

1386
01:35:45,680 --> 01:36:00,640
blue marker his eyes clear why did you why did what the fuck
is around with you bro why did you sign it understood i

1387
01:36:00,640 --> 01:36:08,940
verified its authenticity as per regulations an adult male
is actually not permitted to serve as a child's soul

1388
01:36:08,940 --> 01:36:20,920
gardener is that so yes it's essentially no different from
however since it's you chief it won't be oh your credentials

1389
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:27,020
are beyond reproach could be a single father with processing
the paperwork yeah I was gonna say he needs a wife your time

1390
01:36:27,020 --> 01:36:35,560
sorry to have troubled you I should have handled this in
person I appreciate all your hard work humanity's gum is not

1391
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:42,320
too late well that's the thing with humanity gone you have
to be a dad you got to repopulate the world

1392
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:50,900
urch until his head in but decides against it.

1393
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:53,340
A certain someone still has her eyes on him.

1394
01:36:56,160 --> 01:36:57,200
He's like, yay!

1395
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:59,000
I adopted a father.

1396
01:37:00,240 --> 01:37:00,920
I know.

1397
01:37:01,620 --> 01:37:03,080
I'll be quiet as a mouse.

1398
01:37:03,220 --> 01:37:04,160
I won't make a peep.

1399
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:08,880
Oh, she's gonna see him start rejecting people.

1400
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:12,120
She's gonna see him commit his first war crime.

1401
01:37:13,420 --> 01:37:19,060
His pirate remains squarely fixated on the girl that I saw
because of her.

1402
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:27,700
mind finds a brief escape from its tangled web of thoughts
what a great like first day for her no like daddy's first

1403
01:37:27,700 --> 01:37:36,180
war crime you know she's gonna see it it's true though he's
gonna throw right there like we gotta close the door you

1404
01:37:36,180 --> 01:37:46,300
know for like and leave like thousands of people out to die
and she's gonna see it it's a peak yeah exactly it's peak

1405
01:37:46,300 --> 01:37:50,760
bonding I get more white flowers?

1406
01:37:50,980 --> 01:37:52,140
Oh, I have to replenish.

1407
01:37:52,460 --> 01:37:53,720
Wait, the shop has one.

1408
01:37:54,060 --> 01:37:54,520
I remember.

1409
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:55,300
I could do one more.

1410
01:37:56,980 --> 01:37:57,940
Oh, billions.

1411
01:37:58,180 --> 01:37:59,100
Oh, yeah, billions.

1412
01:37:59,240 --> 01:38:01,020
Okay, I'll do one more replenish.

1413
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:02,920
I have extra.

1414
01:38:03,080 --> 01:38:04,180
Oh, I can't...

1415
01:38:04,180 --> 01:38:05,760
The story is pretty interesting so far.

1416
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:07,060
I'm actually enjoying the story.

1417
01:38:07,200 --> 01:38:09,580
Oh, wait, I could have just bought...

1418
01:38:09,580 --> 01:38:10,420
Just grabbed these.

1419
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:13,300
Wait, whoops.

1420
01:38:13,460 --> 01:38:14,320
It's not what I wanted.

1421
01:38:14,500 --> 01:38:15,480
I'm just clicking everything.

1422
01:38:20,860 --> 01:38:21,620
We're here.

1423
01:38:24,280 --> 01:38:26,260
Yeah, I like the story so far.

1424
01:38:27,380 --> 01:38:29,860
I trust you, troublemakers, behaved while I was away.

1425
01:38:30,820 --> 01:38:31,660
There you are.

1426
01:38:32,600 --> 01:38:33,300
You're late.

1427
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:35,600
What hath detained me thus?

1428
01:38:36,440 --> 01:38:37,460
Are you both all right?

1429
01:38:38,100 --> 01:38:39,760
Speak one at a time, people.

1430
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:43,380
I heard something major happened while we were gone.

1431
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:45,400
You guys held the fort well.

1432
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:46,440
Great job.

1433
01:38:47,160 --> 01:38:47,880
Pish posh.

1434
01:38:48,040 --> 01:38:48,880
It was an easy feat.

1435
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:51,080
Yeah, bring your kid to work, Jay.

1436
01:38:52,360 --> 01:38:52,640
Ah!

1437
01:38:53,720 --> 01:38:54,140
Yes.

1438
01:38:54,980 --> 01:38:57,000
She departed without any regrets.

1439
01:38:57,880 --> 01:38:59,320
And we gave her a proper send-off.

1440
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:00,940
Good.

1441
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:03,080
That's all that matters.

1442
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:08,220
It's a pity I couldn't say goodbye to her.

1443
01:39:08,540 --> 01:39:08,880
Oh well.

1444
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:10,400
There'll be other chances.

1445
01:39:11,100 --> 01:39:11,380
Huh?

1446
01:39:11,700 --> 01:39:12,040
Huh?

1447
01:39:12,340 --> 01:39:17,780
I hate to start barking orders so soon after arriving, but I
need everyone to gather in the meeting room.

1448
01:39:18,780 --> 01:39:20,100
I have an urgent announcement.

1449
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:21,720
She's telling them that she's dying!

1450
01:39:23,160 --> 01:39:30,160
She's telling him that she has terminal Ligma Precisely
Alright, let's go

1451
01:39:36,810 --> 01:39:47,170
She says Oh wait, no, it's just up No, she's not Okay, never
mind Ever she will never open Again on either side Arc

1452
01:39:47,170 --> 01:39:54,130
Guardian A defense mission led by the goddess squad Who will
protect the arc's entrance Until the final ceiling is

1453
01:39:54,130 --> 01:40:02,810
complete Her voice remains steadfast Oh, this is worse dude
oh this is where they're gonna start seeing the billions of

1454
01:40:02,810 --> 01:40:12,710
people that get that get locked up comes to an end that's it
any questions so when do we head in during the final phase

1455
01:40:12,710 --> 01:40:19,510
of the sealing process the same goes for the mass-produced
nike units we'll defend the entrance until the very last

1456
01:40:19,510 --> 01:40:29,190
moment then enter the arc all right how long will it take
until the fifth phase is complete thank you thank you don't

1457
01:40:29,190 --> 01:40:33,650
give my birthday to get and I love to get a birthday wish
from you thank you for being young for giving us the dragons

1458
01:40:33,650 --> 01:40:40,650
lots of happiness and laughter thank you for the super chat
Adam of course of course it's always a pleasure to uh to

1459
01:40:40,650 --> 01:40:48,190
stream for you guys and make you guys have great memories
and laughter with me uh happy birthday to you happy birthday

1460
01:40:48,190 --> 01:40:59,490
to you have birthday dear Adam happy birthday to you yay
happy birthday I don't know depending on the situation at

1461
01:40:59,490 --> 01:41:10,510
hand even in the worst case scenario it shouldn't take more
than a month oh that's rather short yes it is in addition

1462
01:41:10,510 --> 01:41:18,890
since this operation is purely defensive in nature the wings
of victory will be moved to the ark what will happen during

1463
01:41:18,890 --> 01:41:26,270
the third phase that's war planning time even our dedicated
transport base shall be taken from us is there some cause

1464
01:41:26,270 --> 01:41:28,970
for dividing this Okay.

1465
01:41:29,330 --> 01:41:32,990
There's a limit to how many people the Ark can take at one
time.

1466
01:41:33,730 --> 01:41:37,370
So they're splitting the procedure into separate phases to
ensure safety.

1467
01:41:39,350 --> 01:41:42,870
It's just a fine way of saying the Highborn mean to enter
first.

1468
01:41:43,650 --> 01:41:43,770
Hmm.

1469
01:41:45,010 --> 01:41:46,730
It's not just about the people.

1470
01:41:47,370 --> 01:41:47,830
That's right.

1471
01:41:48,130 --> 01:41:52,230
The Ark has dozens of entrances, which act as supply
channels.

1472
01:41:53,130 --> 01:41:57,770
Since the supply is also need to be continually brought in
until the very last moment.

1473
01:41:57,850 --> 01:41:59,570
Yeah, so to feed everyone.

1474
01:42:00,470 --> 01:42:01,350
Step by step.

1475
01:42:02,150 --> 01:42:06,230
This process will make quite a ruckus, which will naturally
attract the raptures.

1476
01:42:07,150 --> 01:42:08,610
It's our job to hold them back.

1477
01:42:09,410 --> 01:42:11,530
There are dozens of entrances, you say?

1478
01:42:11,610 --> 01:42:12,290
Yeah, I was gonna say.

1479
01:42:12,410 --> 01:42:14,210
Then why is there only one for humans?

1480
01:42:14,870 --> 01:42:17,150
It's likely due to the selection process.

1481
01:42:17,810 --> 01:42:19,570
Only those who are chosen may enter.

1482
01:42:20,190 --> 01:42:21,330
Anyone else cannot.

1483
01:42:22,050 --> 01:42:25,490
So I guess, like, those who can't enter are gonna die by the
rapture here.

1484
01:42:25,710 --> 01:42:26,350
They can't let just anyone in.

1485
01:42:28,750 --> 01:42:32,410
Once the first phase is complete, you gotta have a PhD.

1486
01:42:32,490 --> 01:42:34,150
What about those who arrive at the Ark's entrance afterward?

1487
01:42:35,490 --> 01:42:36,790
And those left on the surface?

1488
01:42:37,490 --> 01:42:38,630
What happens to them?

1489
01:42:39,330 --> 01:42:40,150
They're to be abandoned.

1490
01:42:41,350 --> 01:42:42,910
Oh, you know what happens to them.

1491
01:42:43,090 --> 01:42:45,770
Since we lost the battle, we can't save everyone.

1492
01:42:48,790 --> 01:42:50,730
See, yippee, trauma bonding.

1493
01:42:51,150 --> 01:42:52,310
Left for dead.

1494
01:42:53,430 --> 01:42:55,710
Yay, trauma bonding.

1495
01:42:55,870 --> 01:42:56,230
Let's go.

1496
01:42:57,850 --> 01:43:00,290
You know as well as I do, that's impossible.

1497
01:43:01,030 --> 01:43:03,270
There's no way we can even get close to the lift.

1498
01:43:03,270 --> 01:43:04,770
Yeah, there can be a distraction, too.

1499
01:43:05,070 --> 01:43:07,590
Not even if every person on the planet rushed it at the same
time.

1500
01:43:08,150 --> 01:43:09,090
What then, pray?

1501
01:43:09,630 --> 01:43:14,930
Are we to tuck our tails betwixt our legs like hounds
defeated and slink into the depths below?

1502
01:43:15,010 --> 01:43:15,350
Yeah.

1503
01:43:15,630 --> 01:43:16,930
So what do you want us to do?

1504
01:43:17,150 --> 01:43:18,370
We lost, girl!

1505
01:43:18,390 --> 01:43:19,630
Go ahead and bring me the queen's head yourself, then.

1506
01:43:20,590 --> 01:43:21,470
We lost!

1507
01:43:22,090 --> 01:43:23,650
Stop throwing a fit, Scarlet.

1508
01:43:24,350 --> 01:43:24,890
A fit?

1509
01:43:25,210 --> 01:43:25,510
Me?

1510
01:43:26,270 --> 01:43:27,750
We're part of the loss.

1511
01:43:27,850 --> 01:43:29,910
They'll be all, meaning adjourned.

1512
01:43:30,670 --> 01:43:33,110
If you've got any complaints or questions, come to me.

1513
01:43:35,130 --> 01:43:38,110
However, think through what you want to say before you do.

1514
01:43:38,950 --> 01:43:41,190
If you intend to come to me simply to whine, don't bother.

1515
01:43:41,190 --> 01:43:42,670
I mean, she was part of the loss, too.

1516
01:43:42,890 --> 01:43:43,350
Let's go, Lilith.

1517
01:43:44,690 --> 01:43:45,350
Yes, Commander.

1518
01:43:45,710 --> 01:43:47,510
So it's not like she didn't know.

1519
01:43:49,750 --> 01:43:50,190
Like...

1520
01:43:53,980 --> 01:43:55,520
All right, here we go.

1521
01:43:58,500 --> 01:43:58,940
Whatever.

1522
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:00,620
I'll just do what I can.

1523
01:44:01,580 --> 01:44:10,360
Alright, pew pew pew Don't worry We transported in this case
from the future To the past for this exact mission Wait, why

1524
01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:11,340
is she in the front?

1525
01:44:11,820 --> 01:44:12,560
Are you okay?

1526
01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:15,240
Wait, is she supposed to be in the front?

1527
01:44:15,620 --> 01:44:16,520
Wait, is she okay?

1528
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:22,600
I was thinking, I was like Why is she there by herself?

1529
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:25,540
What a truly beautiful story This was.

1530
01:44:25,820 --> 01:44:28,120
I was like, Girl, take cover, girl!

1531
01:44:29,340 --> 01:44:39,360
The whole point is to take cover no but it's fine i was like
is she supposed to be there i was like

1532
01:44:44,360 --> 01:44:54,370
all right nice it's

1533
01:44:58,330 --> 01:45:12,330
all right this this rabbit is not okay oh no i think
bringing a rabbit is It's not ideal in the battlefield.

1534
01:45:12,630 --> 01:45:13,830
I'll get you to your destination.

1535
01:45:16,190 --> 01:45:17,110
Oh my god.

1536
01:45:17,890 --> 01:45:18,470
Coffee?

1537
01:45:20,930 --> 01:45:22,170
My god, okay.

1538
01:45:24,230 --> 01:45:26,510
Yeah, that rabbit definitely has PTSD.

1539
01:45:29,650 --> 01:45:30,250
Yay!

1540
01:45:31,350 --> 01:45:32,630
I did it.

1541
01:45:36,420 --> 01:45:37,020
Alright.

1542
01:45:37,380 --> 01:45:37,640
Wait.

1543
01:45:38,120 --> 01:45:39,340
Okay, here we go.

1544
01:45:44,070 --> 01:45:52,470
Oh, we're still mad okay we just came back from a fight and
she's still mad all right rather than beating up the table

1545
01:45:52,470 --> 01:46:01,390
why don't you say something yeah i am merely venting is that
forbidden of course it's not truth be told i'd love to do

1546
01:46:01,390 --> 01:46:09,870
the same is there truly no other way it's as you said the
only option left is to defeat the queen and i don't think

1547
01:46:09,870 --> 01:46:17,750
that's gonna happen because she is alive in the third year
anniversary so I don't think they did it I don't think they

1548
01:46:17,750 --> 01:46:29,010
won a hundred years ago so I am rendered a defeated hound
tail tucked as I flee even so we can still save the ones

1549
01:46:29,010 --> 01:46:37,470
within our reach that's what we have to do we don't have
enough supplies we can't and what if we save like someone

1550
01:46:37,470 --> 01:46:45,150
that doesn't have a phd yeah so let's not think of it as
losing but a temporary retreat

1551
01:46:49,210 --> 01:47:02,350
hmm what why is everyone looking at me like that because
you're the most mature among us yeah i guess i mean she is

1552
01:47:02,350 --> 01:47:09,810
sort of what we can she doesn't speak with emotions we might
up losing what we already have in our hands we must

1553
01:47:09,810 --> 01:47:18,510
understand our own limits all of us but if there had been a
way the commander and lilith wouldn't have stood idle

1554
01:47:18,510 --> 01:47:26,550
they've accepted it and moved on so should we our duty is to
strive for the best possible outcome in our current

1555
01:47:26,550 --> 01:47:32,970
situation don't be one of those people who rage when there's
no solution wait it's one with a lottery that's

1556
01:47:36,510 --> 01:47:38,050
No, there's no helping it.

1557
01:47:38,230 --> 01:47:40,110
What if the guy that's gonna...

1558
01:47:40,750 --> 01:47:43,990
The guy that's gonna cure cancer didn't win the lottery.

1559
01:47:45,150 --> 01:47:48,870
What if the guy who invented Nikes didn't win the lottery?

1560
01:47:49,950 --> 01:47:51,510
Why am I so feeble thus?

1561
01:47:52,390 --> 01:47:52,750
Indeed.

1562
01:47:55,170 --> 01:47:56,130
Come now, Dorothy.

1563
01:47:56,550 --> 01:47:57,830
Twas but a passive remark.

1564
01:47:58,370 --> 01:47:58,710
Technically, yes.

1565
01:47:58,930 --> 01:48:01,210
Surely thou dost not truly deem me weak.

1566
01:48:01,990 --> 01:48:04,330
You can't even remember what you said a moment ago.

1567
01:48:04,410 --> 01:48:05,570
Well, too bad.

1568
01:48:06,510 --> 01:48:17,190
with me for a moment very well come again you told me to
step outside with you oh I mean to cross blades with thee

1569
01:48:17,190 --> 01:48:27,790
fine let's do it she's gonna 1v1 Rapunzel Rapunzel look oh
my god Rapunzel look the moment she loses you're gonna 1v1

1570
01:48:27,790 --> 01:48:31,870
me then prepare to prostrate thyself and admit defeat.

1571
01:48:34,890 --> 01:48:36,090
Dorothy smiled.

1572
01:48:37,110 --> 01:48:37,790
My apologies.

1573
01:48:37,950 --> 01:48:38,930
Oh my god, she likes it.

1574
01:48:38,930 --> 01:48:39,910
That was simply too absurd.

1575
01:48:40,010 --> 01:48:41,210
I couldn't help myself.

1576
01:48:42,030 --> 01:48:43,890
Oh my god, she's crazy.

1577
01:48:45,270 --> 01:48:47,990
Oh, oh, she's you could tell she's crazy.

1578
01:48:48,330 --> 01:48:51,210
That's not, that's a serial killer smile right there.

1579
01:48:51,790 --> 01:48:54,750
That's a serial killer smile.

1580
01:48:55,170 --> 01:48:56,710
That ain't a regular smile.

1581
01:48:59,930 --> 01:49:04,350
I Will protect my passengers Oh, where are the enemies?

1582
01:49:05,770 --> 01:49:14,570
I forgot I remember I saw like a video where like you're
supposed to like I think it's like first you um The story

1583
01:49:14,570 --> 01:49:22,170
will be rewritten like how to know you have a serial killer
smile Where you have to like hide your hide your eyes or

1584
01:49:22,170 --> 01:49:30,810
some you smile and then like I remember I remember this step
There's like a video trend where they're like, how do you

1585
01:49:30,810 --> 01:49:32,730
know if you have a serial killer smile?

1586
01:49:40,540 --> 01:49:40,960
And then what?

1587
01:49:41,020 --> 01:49:41,720
I don't remember.

1588
01:49:42,040 --> 01:49:43,860
I watched a video like months ago.

1589
01:49:45,300 --> 01:49:46,880
I truly hate this.

1590
01:49:47,540 --> 01:49:48,840
What exactly do you hate?

1591
01:49:48,840 --> 01:49:52,940
There was one where I do remember it where it's like, if you
can...

1592
01:49:54,620 --> 01:50:00,020
There's like a song that plays, and if you can like move
from one end, from one side, if your eyes can follow from

1593
01:50:00,020 --> 01:50:03,880
one side to the other smoothly, then you're like, there's a
chance you're a serial killer.

1594
01:50:03,900 --> 01:50:14,640
killer like but you know it's like because it's like it's
not like it's not like snappy it's just a smooth like left

1595
01:50:14,640 --> 01:50:22,580
to right if you're startled can't you at least react like
you are you have the killer genes I didn't think anyone else

1596
01:50:23,480 --> 01:50:31,900
didn't you hear I even not oh it's like this dumb tick-tock
trends it's like The witch dress, yeah.

1597
01:50:32,920 --> 01:50:35,840
She's can move her eyes left to right smoothly.

1598
01:50:37,920 --> 01:50:38,360
Not bad.

1599
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:41,240
You're beginning to show the qualities of the next leader.

1600
01:50:42,160 --> 01:50:43,700
I learned from watching you.

1601
01:50:44,460 --> 01:50:46,420
And remember, I'm not a danger right now.

1602
01:50:46,420 --> 01:50:48,660
You move your eyes from left to right.

1603
01:50:48,820 --> 01:50:50,720
They're like, it's like super snappy.

1604
01:50:50,920 --> 01:50:53,520
It's like, it's like, snap, snap, snap.

1605
01:50:53,680 --> 01:50:54,720
You can't do it like a smooth.

1606
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:59,020
It's really hard to do a very smooth transition from left to
right.

1607
01:51:01,060 --> 01:51:02,800
She found out!

1608
01:51:04,260 --> 01:51:04,600
Hmm?

1609
01:51:07,100 --> 01:51:09,000
Lilith, you don't mean...

1610
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:09,740
Surely not.

1611
01:51:10,420 --> 01:51:11,060
Six months.

1612
01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:11,880
Tops!

1613
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:13,140
She found out!

1614
01:51:16,340 --> 01:51:17,020
Seriously?

1615
01:51:17,860 --> 01:51:20,780
If you're surprised, can you at least act like it?

1616
01:51:21,300 --> 01:51:22,520
Is there really no alternative?

1617
01:51:22,520 --> 01:51:24,480
Wait, I just... do... Burn him!

1618
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:25,960
He's a serial killer!

1619
01:51:26,180 --> 01:51:26,680
Prunim!

1620
01:51:27,940 --> 01:51:36,100
But, given the situation, that's not really an option you
should retire at once and get some rest you know i can't do

1621
01:51:36,100 --> 01:51:44,640
that are you going to tell everyone i have six months to
live you gotta rest bro it's not like she can fucking get

1622
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:53,780
better dorothy are you stupid you should at least you should
you should rest as a male how if that's the right thing to

1623
01:51:53,780 --> 01:52:03,060
do do you want her to endure the same pain twice i'm not
sure that kid can handle it snow white's not a kid anymore

1624
01:52:03,060 --> 01:52:12,880
she's just haven't upgraded her since then to me everyone is
still a kid even me i'm only telling you this because i

1625
01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:21,300
don't think you are sometimes i wish people would treat me
like a kid too i understand she's like the adult

1626
01:52:21,300 --> 01:52:30,300
responsibilities me too george do you need to keep this in
mind if anything happens i'll be counting of we've got the

1627
01:52:30,300 --> 01:52:37,760
commander he is likely going to be the one who breaks down
the hardest he's playing it cool now but i'm sure of it

1628
01:52:39,640 --> 01:52:49,120
sorry for dropping all that on you out of nowhere when have
you not so future leader what is it you hate so much oh so

1629
01:52:49,120 --> 01:52:58,960
she nominated her myself huh i hate myself i'm stuck in this
loop of self-loathing Hello?

1630
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:00,860
I didn't see this coming.

1631
01:53:00,960 --> 01:53:01,680
She hates herself.

1632
01:53:02,220 --> 01:53:02,320
Hmm.

1633
01:53:03,180 --> 01:53:11,660
When all this is over, when the Ark is sealed, we will
return and be lauded as heroes, the ones who defended

1634
01:53:11,660 --> 01:53:13,980
humanity to the end.

1635
01:53:14,380 --> 01:53:15,720
Goddesses are victory.

1636
01:53:16,660 --> 01:53:17,700
Humanities hope.

1637
01:53:18,380 --> 01:53:20,520
Our legacy will live on forever.

1638
01:53:21,440 --> 01:53:23,400
It might even turn into a myth someday.

1639
01:53:23,660 --> 01:53:28,100
And then maybe someday we'll play video games based off this
legend.

1640
01:53:28,820 --> 01:53:31,640
still be celebrated as heroes back in the Ark.

1641
01:53:32,360 --> 01:53:35,620
And I'll live with that fact, fully content.

1642
01:53:35,860 --> 01:53:36,380
Oh, eh.

1643
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:41,640
Telling myself that our fight, my fight, was not in vain.

1644
01:53:42,340 --> 01:53:43,260
That's what I hate.

1645
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,640
Everyone wants something different out of this.

1646
01:53:47,340 --> 01:53:47,860
I know.

1647
01:53:48,520 --> 01:53:50,240
I still don't like it.

1648
01:53:50,780 --> 01:53:52,920
So you're just doing things half-heartedly?

1649
01:53:53,840 --> 01:53:54,760
Of course not.

1650
01:53:55,280 --> 01:53:56,020
Then you're good.

1651
01:53:56,380 --> 01:53:58,340
There won't be any issues in that case.

1652
01:53:59,020 --> 01:53:59,640
Thanks.

1653
01:54:01,820 --> 01:54:05,220
You're the only one I could speak to about such things.

1654
01:54:06,160 --> 01:54:07,100
And now you're leaving.

1655
01:54:07,720 --> 01:54:07,820
Oh.

1656
01:54:08,140 --> 01:54:09,320
Yeah, it looks like it.

1657
01:54:10,360 --> 01:54:12,700
I mean, she'll still be here for six months.

1658
01:54:13,680 --> 01:54:14,700
Can't stop that.

1659
01:54:15,080 --> 01:54:16,000
I don't want to either.

1660
01:54:18,960 --> 01:54:20,760
That's too damn bad.

1661
01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:26,400
Oh, hello, Snow White.

1662
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:28,740
Snow White.

1663
01:54:29,440 --> 01:54:29,620
And?

1664
01:54:30,660 --> 01:54:31,520
What's wrong?

1665
01:54:31,620 --> 01:54:34,580
Is there something about the operation you don't understand?

1666
01:54:35,940 --> 01:54:36,420
Oh, no.

1667
01:54:36,880 --> 01:54:37,780
It's not that.

1668
01:54:39,360 --> 01:54:40,520
How are you doing?

1669
01:54:41,700 --> 01:54:42,380
Are you okay?

1670
01:54:43,120 --> 01:54:43,840
Of course.

1671
01:54:44,160 --> 01:54:45,260
Why would I not be?

1672
01:54:45,940 --> 01:54:50,980
Oh, it's just... You seem a little different from your usual

1725
01:57:54,320 --> 01:58:00,300
I handed the leader to someone else because like to someone
that had like the highest amount of playtime, because

1726
01:58:00,300 --> 01:58:04,800
apparently if you don't log in frequently, it like, it like
gives it to someone else.

1727
01:58:04,960 --> 01:58:07,660
