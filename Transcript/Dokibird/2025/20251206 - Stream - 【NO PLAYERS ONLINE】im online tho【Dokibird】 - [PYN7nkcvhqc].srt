00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:11,130
It's just like, I feel just like sometimes it's just, I

36
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:22,290
I can't tell if it's my tooth or my gums Because it's all
the far back So far back It's like the very back tube So I

37
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:41,050

think it's okay Stop touching it So So like I don't know I'm

38
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,250
not sure Lolly, do you have a super chat?

39
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:43,970
No, there's no blood.

40
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:44,870
There's no blood, guys.

41
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:49,430
There's no, just to make sure, just so you guys all know,
there is no blood.

42
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,850
Everything is fine in that area.

43
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,690
Yeah, it might be a filling came loose.

44
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:55,610
It could be a filling.

45
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:56,510
I know I did.

46
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:02,250
I did got a root canal on one of, I don't think it's that
two.

47
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,890
I don't know if it's that two.

48
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:11,370
Okay, so let me give you a history on what my parents did to
my teeth.

49
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:17,250
When I was very young, they enclosed my mom.

50
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:22,510
I think apparently now people don't do that anymore because
people were like, that's a pretty bad idea.

51
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:30,990
So instead of getting braces or, you know, other things that
kids normally go through, I never got braces.

52
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:40,790
Because what my mom did was, I told this story before, she
enclosed my teeth with silver.

53
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:54,570
I have no idea what that means But apparently nowadays
people don't do that anymore But my teeth was like enclosed

54
00:06:54,570 --> 00:07:02,530
with like those silver fill Like I don't remember what it is
But like I basically had like silver Silver teeth and stuff

55
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:14,930
On my teeth So it's like silver fillings I don't know I'm
not sure what they're called anymore Um, you're so bougie.

56
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:24,810
So, um, so I never, I didn't really get, uh, I didn't really
get like actual like braces.

57
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:27,710
So I just did that to fix my teeth.

58
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,890
And I was like really, really young.

59
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:33,270
That's why I hated the dentist, um, when I was little.

60
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:38,310
Because like, um, I call it, but it's a crowd.

61
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:38,610
I don't know.

62
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:39,450
I don't remember what it was called.

63
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,630
Um, so it was just like the backstabbing.

64
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,390
Like it wasn't like the front teeth.

65
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:47,210
It's like the backs and everything So like my front teeth
was fine.

66
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:54,130
They just she just put like silver teeth on the back ones
And I think maybe it's the silver fillings finally coming up

67
00:07:54,130 --> 00:08:04,410
because it's like been years So So I've always had like
trauma and PTSD from the dentist because My mom did that and

68
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:12,930
then I never went to the dentist after that But like I had
so many dentist visits for like I think like two to three

69
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:15,170
years of my life when I was really little.

70
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:24,010
But they like kept, because of that, they do those like
little, they do like those little, like, you know, like the

71
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:26,570
anesthesia where they numb your mouth and everything.

72
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,350
But it was so because I was a kid, right?

73
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,830
It was so fucking painful.

74
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,030
And I had to go to the dentist.

75
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:36,870
Like, I think like so many times.

76
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:37,670
I don't even remember.

77
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:38,750
It was so long ago.

78
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,630
But I had to go to dentist so many times as a little kid.

79
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:45,730
and they always had to yeah so i had like trauma from the
dentist because of that because they're always poking

80
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:52,110
needles in my mouth and it was so fucking painful and i
remember one time they fucked it up twice because i was so

81
00:08:52,110 --> 00:09:01,170
scared i think i moved and they they like they like uh
punched it they put the needle in it in the wrong area so i

82
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:05,890
have to they have to like be like i need to use the bathroom
and i come because i was like oh they're done they did the

83
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:11,890
needle thing but because i moved they they put the needle in
the wrong area and then when i came back from the because

84
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,150
this was like trauma, you know?

85
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:17,030
And then it came back like, all right, we gotta do this
again because we did it in the wrong part of your mouth.

86
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,270
And I was like, what?

87
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,130
What do you mean?

88
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:27,090
You know, I didn't understand that because I was a little
kid.

89
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,990
I was like, what do you mean?

90
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:30,210
Did I not do it?

91
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,750
Like, did I not?

92
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,010
Did you not?

93
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,250
What do you mean yet?

94
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:41,190
So I was, I really, really am not a fan of the dentist
because of it, because I had to go to the dentist so many

95
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,570
times as a little kid.

96
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:51,570
Um, that like the especially the needle part it was just so
fucking painful as a child like now like I know like we like

97
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:57,290
when I went to dentist to get root canal a couple years ago
it didn't hurt as much as it did when I was a little kid

98
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:05,890
because I don't know I had more pain receptors in my mouth
back then now I'm more numb to the feeling of pain because

99
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:12,950
because I've had worse now like as a kid you know you never
had felt that pain before but now now I'm more numb to it so

100
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:21,410
so DFM, thank you for this super chat, thank you, thank you,
don't hear you silver too.

101
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:26,370
So I think one of the, maybe the silver filling finally
popped off of my molars.

102
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,990
I think maybe that's what happened.

103
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:37,470
So, because like, it's not, I don't know, I don't think it's
a, I mean, it could be a cavity, I don't know.

104
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:41,750
I don't think it's a cavity just because I don't feel any
pain from it.

105
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,650
So unless like, I don't know.

106
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:46,090
Unless, like, the nerve's fucking dead.

107
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:49,130
That's also a concern.

108
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:54,710
So I'm hoping, I'm hoping that the nerve's not dead.

109
00:10:55,610 --> 00:11:00,810
And it's just, just the filling came out.

110
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:03,350
Just because I cracked it.

111
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,790
What did I eat?

112
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:06,770
I ate a steak.

113
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:09,810
My bad.

114
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:20,470
I, that's, I fucked up the, Here, I ate a steak and yeah,
that might have been why it got cracked a little.

115
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,430
Bro, of course you did.

116
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:27,450
I don't even eat steak that much, too.

117
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:32,230
That was the first steak I ate in like six plus months.

118
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:36,010
So I was like, I was like, y'all, y'all, y'all.

119
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,590
And I'm like, ah.

120
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,370
It was a good steak.

121
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,070
It was a fucking rhubarb, though.

122
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,550
Um, Pixel, thank you for the super chat.

123
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:45,850
Thank you.

124
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:46,450
Thank you.

125
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:51,370
Last time I talked about the dentist, I scared one of my
friends that was preparing mentally for months to go to a

126
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:51,630
dentist.

127
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:52,530
I felt so bad.

128
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,490
But I remember when I talked about getting a root canal.

129
00:11:54,650 --> 00:12:00,590
That shit was, because like, I didn't know what a root canal
really was, but also, like, it was like five years ago.

130
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:04,030
And that shit scared, like, oh yeah, I remember I told you
guys.

131
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:08,210
It's because, like, I wish I still have the picture I drew.

132
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,910
But like, my root canal was my teeth.

133
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,190
I don't know if you guys remembered the story.

134
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:19,950
like remember it got for those who remember I got root canal
done a couple of years ago I don't remember this was like

135
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:29,170
from before I joined a corpo or was it after I joined a
corporal but um when I was getting my root canal done I

136
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:40,390
don't know if anyone remembered this story but the tooth
that had the root canal was so fucked up it was I remember

137
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:48,730
you guys if you remember the picture up because they're like
oh yeah you have three because like you know if tiff has

138
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,570
It's supposed to be two.

139
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:55,290
You know, it's supposed to be two like the two pinchers.

140
00:12:55,650 --> 00:13:03,730
I think mine had three I think I don't know if you guys
remember the story, but mine had like three So it was like a

141
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:12,230
fucking alien like yeah, they had roots in the root canal So
it was like a fucking I'm not talking about the wisdom to

142
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:21,010
but like um it had three instead of two so so it was a
fucking mutant teeth that had a root that had to get a root

143
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:28,750
canal in and so like they obviously that means they had to
like kill off the nerves but it was so fucked up that it

144
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:36,990
made it even more painful than it should be just because it
had three instead of two i was like where did the extra lid

145
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:46,010
come from and why did it have to be this tooth like I was
like, I was just like, out of all the teeth, out of all the

146
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:48,630
teeth, teeth that's in my mouth.

147
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:53,130
The one I fucked up was the mutant one.

148
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:57,270
Anyway, Petra said, thank you for the super chat.

149
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,250
Thank you, thank you.

150
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:00,350
The last two times, a feeling came out for me.

151
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:00,990
It was a sit.

152
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:05,630
You didn't happen to spit anything out and felt a cold air
vacuum sensation near that tube, did you?

153
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:06,590
Thank you, the super chat.

00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:09,130
I think I just cracked the feeling.

156
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:21,130
feel a cold air sensation near it too like i'm sure i yeah i
don't feel it so i think it's like um i think it just

157
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:27,250
cracked it and then that's why like it feels weird because
obviously they're like why is there a fucking crack in my

158
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:37,290
body's like okay that's not supposed to happen um so i don't
know we'll see silver filling is tend to crack after 10 plus

159
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:45,750
years yeah i assume it's the filling because my molars are
the ones that got the silver filling not like the front part

160
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:53,230
it's just my molars so i think i think it's just age too
long um i just think it was super chat thank you thank you

167
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,030
Why did they were just like happy anniversary?

168
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:47,030
Like, they just gave me a happy anniversary.

169
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:48,590
I was like, at least let me say it.

170
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,030
I'm Doki Bird.

171
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:55,910
I can't believe it's been a year.

172
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,090
Oh my gosh.

173
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:59,270
Hello, hello.

174
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:01,010
It's me, Doki Bird.

175
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:04,710
I'm here to wish my rivals a happy anniversary.

176
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:06,030
Yeah.

177
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,150
I'm like, okay.

178
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,750
And then I say a lot more after that.

179
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,690
I'm like, they could have just...

180
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:14,310
Like, they could have just said, Hello, hello, everyone.

181
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:15,630
It's me, Dokey Bird.

182
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,290
Happy at Marble Rivals.

183
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,470
Happy anniversary.

184
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,930
But then they cut the part where I say, I'm Dokey Bird.

185
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,150
But then I'm like, what the fuck?

186
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,550
The other people get to introduce themselves.

187
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,470
And it was so much longer.

188
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,810
I was just like, what the fuck?

189
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:48,830
And so I was just like, I was like, wait, where's my, like,
why can't I tell everyone I'm Doki Bird?

190
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:55,870
But no, I did send in a 42 second video, though.

191
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:56,910
I did send that.

192
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:02,030
But I do appreciate them asking me and adding me and you
were nominated.

193
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:03,950
That's why.

194
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:05,730
I mean, that makes sense to.

195
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:11,010
I do appreciate them adding me in and asking me to record.

196
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:18,630
something um i i definitely should have record said like i
definitely should have maybe recorded less because i gave a

197
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:23,930
42 second video um to be fair there was like a lot of
guidelines i thought i don't know i didn't really i didn't

198
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:34,090
realize like what kind of video they were making um maybe i
should have made it much more simple i i shuddered down i

199
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:37,530
definitely should have made it A bit more simple for sure.

200
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:42,230
Anyway, anyway, where was that?

201
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:46,310
Okay, so today we're going to be playing No Players Online.

202
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:51,450
For those who might be like, why does that game sound very
familiar?

203
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:57,690
A long, long time ago, it was like an, it was, I mean, it
still is an indie game.

204
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:03,850
But it was like a really short game uploaded on Ichio.

205
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:13,750
this game is because I it was a very um because a very
popular let's play video was made out of it like from game

206
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:23,710
grumps where um I think it was like Danny is like afraid of
horror games and then Aaron tricked Danny Dan to play uh to

207
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:30,910
play no players online and apparently it's it was like I
remember watching that video so I know I remember sort of

208
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:37,690
like I sort of remember the gameplay of So it's basically it
was like a horror game and it ended up being like an AR.

209
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:44,410
Yeah, I'm game grumps It was a horror game on game grumps,
but it didn't look like a horror game until like Surprise

210
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:52,530
like a fucking ghost shows up because it's no players online
and Suddenly a player was online, you know the prep like,

211
00:18:52,570 --> 00:19:03,790
you know, it's sort of obvious To figure out the premise is
like no players online unless there was a player online And

212
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,550
so that's like the whole premise of the game.

213
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:11,610
And I remember watching that video.

214
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:15,250
And I was like, oh, that seems like a, I mean, it was a good
video.

215
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:21,950
And apparently a couple of weeks ago, a couple spoiled the
game.

216
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,170
Shake my head up.

217
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:24,830
Spoilers, Donkey.

218
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,610
How was I supposed to know?

219
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:30,710
It was, there was going to be a player online.

220
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:33,490
online, Doki.

221
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:35,470
How dare you spoil the plot twist?

222
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:42,950
And then apparently there was like a whole ARG made out of
that game.

223
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:47,410
So like, you know, for those who don't know what ARG is,
like there'd be like hidden messages and stuff scattered

224
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:52,050
around the web and people were trying to figure out like the
entire story of this game.

225
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:53,390
And apparently it was a huge thing.

226
00:19:53,490 --> 00:20:01,890
I remember reading it on Wikipedia about the ARG and it
became a whole wild thing from it that stemmed for it.

227
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:06,610
Anyway, the full game just released a couple of weeks ago.

228
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,750
They made a full edition of this game.

229
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:18,130
I don't really know exactly what the full game brings.

230
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:27,650
But I did read a little bit of the reviews, and they did say
that it shifted from a horror to a mystery.

231
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:31,430
I guess to follow up with the whole ARG thing.

232
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:35,170
They made it more of a like, oh, what the fuck is going on?

233
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:38,250
So they did, like, add some mystery and drama to it.

234
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:40,290
So it's not just, like, a full-on horror.

235
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,390
So I feel like, you know, it'll be interesting.

236
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:45,790
Anyway, I hope Sound Guy is here to figure out the sound for
us.

237
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:46,990
All right, let's see.

238
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:48,890
No players online.

239
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:57,950
Yeah, so I don't know if there is jump scares or anything,
but, like I said, they apparently added more to the genre.

240
00:20:58,130 --> 00:20:59,570
So it's not just horror now.

241
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,350
It's a mystery.

242
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:18,190
all right let's see is it hello are you not capturing my
game sir no players online hello oh my god don't tell me

246
00:21:51,910 --> 00:22:03,910

247

249
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,860
Just like the original.

250
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,520
Oh, it's DVR on?

251
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:28,640
Sorry, my manager made this waiting room.

252
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,700
DVR is off now.

253
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,140
No more replay for all of you.

254
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:34,500
Alright.

255
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,280
Adam, but...

256
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,620
Okay, I remembered this.

257
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,640
I remember this from the original playthrough.

258
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,860
So it's basically capture the flag.

259
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,220
But like, just me.

260
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,410
With sound by Victor Cross.

261
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:53,010
Oh, wow.

262
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:53,910
Why is it red?

263
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:56,110
Oh, I'm just going to walk this way.

264
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,030
Oh, I can't.

265
00:22:59,030 --> 00:22:59,910
I don't like that.

266
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:01,170
Oh!

267
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:02,810
Oh!

268
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,790
How is that worse?

269
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,830
Okay, I'm okay.

270
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,410
My eyes!

271
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:17,590
Oh, shit.

272
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,110
It burns.

273
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:28,910
It's a little red, doggie.

274
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:31,430
It's...

275
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:32,670
It burns!

276
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,770
That's actually crazy.

277
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:36,370
Oh, shit.

278
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:38,210
That's an old-ass computer.

279
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:42,670
1960 to 1974.

280
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,060
Oh, my God.

281
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:49,980

282
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,620
Oh, my God.

We're on dial-up.

284
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,880
Someone's using the phone right now.

285
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:02,580
Are you blind forever?

286

So it means there's two mines next to me.

309
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,020
Oh, shit.

310
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,080
Nice, I did it.

311
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,940
I assume this is the mine.

312
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,140
Right?

313
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,180
And it won.

314
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:10,560
And then so this.

315
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:11,980
Yeah, this is the mine.

316
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,400
So this should be fine.

317
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,880

It has to be this.

380
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,600

381
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,240

It has to be this or is this.

395
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,240

00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:37,480
Yeah.

499
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:39,880
Here?

500
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,820
You think this is safe.

501
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,380
There's no way this is safe.

502
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,580
It's a 50-50.

503
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,160
That's a boom.

504
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,800
Oh, no.

505
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,140
Cut the red wire.

506
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,820
Which wire is it, guys?

507
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,080
Oh, my God.

508
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,380
Oh, my God.

509
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,260
The tension.

510
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,440
The fucking tension.

511
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,740
Above three.

512
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:18,400
Blue.

513
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,240
The red, blue, or red.

514
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,020
Okay, guys.

515
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,520
Which wire do we cut?

516
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:23,900
Red, green, or blue?

517
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:32,360
Oh, oh, oh my god.

518
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,040
Oh, I cut the blue wire.

519
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,800
Oh, that was tense.

520
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:39,140
That was tense.

521
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,060
Who the fuck said green?

522
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,320
Who said the green wire?

523
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,080
I am the bomb expert.

524
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,400
What would you do if I was the bomb expert?

525
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,400
Okay, one, two.

526
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,340
Okay.

527
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:55,660
Okay.

528
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,160
Oh, no.

529
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,260
This is safe.

530
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:00,660
Oh, God.

531
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,180
Oh, God.

532
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,140
Oh, God.

533
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,360
Oh, my God.

534
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:07,820
Okay.

535
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,100
Three.

536
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:09,980
Oh, okay.

537
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,960
One, two, three.

538
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,040
That should be all the bombs.

539
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:16,360
Wait, no.

540
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,600
That's not.

541
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,380
That's not all the bombs.

542
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,480
Okay.

543
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:30,360
Oh my god.

544
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,200
Maybe the...

545
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:59,520
Oh, it's not The game would just be like, there you go.

546
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,620
Oh, shit, this is the bomb.

547
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,680
Okay, this is the bomb.

548
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,340
One, two.

549
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,040
And then one, two, three.

550
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,140
So this is safe.

551
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,900
And then one, two.

552
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,560
This is the bomb.

553
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:25,960
Oh, God.

554
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,900
Okay, I'll talk to my friend now.

555
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:28,940
Okay.

556
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,360
I need to fix this.

557
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,020
I cannot.

558
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:35,340
I don't understand why they do this to me.

559
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,640
I don't like the desktop shit.

560
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,620
I think if the desktop was not shaking, I'd be fine.

561
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,760
Get this out of my screen!

562
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,940
And the desktop glitch, too.

563
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:58,110
There.

564
00:40:58,610 --> 00:40:59,710
Desktop shake.

565
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:02,130
Needs more shake.

566
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:03,210
There we go.

567
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:05,210
Low.

568
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:07,030
Alright.

569
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:08,090
There we go.

570
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:09,510
Okay, I should have just put it on low.

571
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:11,310

00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:12,970
Stupid.

00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:14,230

No, no.

587
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:20,610
It's like a capture the flag.

588
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:22,010
Where can I get the game?

589
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,600

594
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:13,060
fire could do that wake up a fire doesn't choose what it
destroys it just destroys locking posts Jason warning for

600
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,260
I like the game a lot.

601
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,580
The explosions when you kill a fish are a really nice touch.

602
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,200
How do you change the shop icons when a player buys
something?

603
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:06,700
Also, was it difficult to make the swimming animations?

604
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,440
Was there a reason you chose four directional movements
instead of A?

605
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:10,440
Too long.

606
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:11,320
TLDR.

607
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:13,880
I'm too busy building my franchise.

608
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:16,120

611
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:21,620
Bro, Jason sounds like a cool guy.

612
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:24,640
Jason the Super Dev.

613
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,400

618
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:39,920
Alright.

619
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:42,680
Let's play Fishing with Knives.

620
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,440
What the fuck?

621
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:53,100
Okay.

622
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,500
That's right.

623
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:56,440
Fishing with Knives!

624
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:58,080
Let's let you go!

625
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:00,980
Oh, shit.

626
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:03,460
That's a lot of stats for this one.

627
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:09,000
Okay, when can I redeem my fish?

628
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:10,180
Oh, wait.

629
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:11,040
I did it.

630
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:12,540
I'll have more air now.

631
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:13,400
Savvy.

632
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:14,760
Triple A guarantee.

633
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,320
I don't understand why this game is not popular.

634
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:22,360
Bro, I'm literally fishing with knives.

635
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,020
What more can I want?

636
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,600
Bro, this game has everything.

637
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:26,960
thing.

638
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:31,580
Okay, I need a hundred points to fish more with knives.

639
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:35,220
Oh, the deeper I go, the bigger the fish.

640
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,900
Oh my god, this takes forever.

641
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:41,240
Okay, guys, I need a stronger knife.

642
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:44,120
And stab, stab.

643
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:48,940
It has fishing and it has knives.

644
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,460
What more can a guy want?

645
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:52,620
Okay.

646
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,000
Don't worry, I almost got there.

647
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:55,380
Nice.

648
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:56,440
Not 200.

649
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,520
Does it upgrade my knives?

650
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,460
At all?

651
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,760
Sure, I would like knife upgrades.

652
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:03,560
Oh, what's this?

653
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:05,280
Oh, oh my god, that's a shot.

654
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,060
Wait, I need that.

655
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:07,640
Okay.

656
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:10,360
But that's a stronger gun.

657
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:11,940
Nice.

658
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:12,280
Okay.

659
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,160
That's a stronger knife.

660
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:17,040
Let me go.

661
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,180
Boom, boom, boom.

662
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,700
Oh my god, I can do double kill too with this.

663
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,880
Oh my god, look at the explosions, guys.

664
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,340
Okay, we gotta get a gun.

665
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:28,700
I think that's a gun, right?

666
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:30,160
Oh, my God.

667
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:32,060
Get out of here, fish.

668
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,240
Get out of here!

669
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,480
That's right!

670
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,960
The fisherman is here!

671
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:43,360
Eventually, I'll play this.

672
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,520
My friend is still waiting for me.

673
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,640
I'm like, I'm sorry, bro.

674
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:52,540
I'm gonna play fishing with knives, bro.

675
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,040
You understand, right?

676
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:05,460
fish fear me women fear me too I don't know why is it
because of my knife gun

677
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:19,500
there you go and that's enough for the next upgrade I'm
pretty sure okay it's 500 don't worry I got this but I keep

678
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:29,600
farming nice nice I got it oh my god wait I think the second
one is like an actual Fucking sword.

679
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:32,440
There you go.

680
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,040
Oh my god, I'm fucking bragging right now.

681
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:38,880
There you go.

682
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,340
Oh my god, that's a goddamn great white shark!

683
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:44,080
That's fucking right!

684
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,120
Not even sharks are safe from me!

685
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:48,900
Okay, I need a thousand.

686
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,100
The game has levels!

687
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:55,340
For him.

688
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:57,240
Guys, is this sound too loud?

689
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:01,300
Wait, I have enough.

690
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:04,940
Alright, here we go.

691
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,260
I just have enough.

692
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:10,180
Oh my god, it can go even higher.

693
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:11,620
That's right.

694
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:12,900
I got enough now.

695
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,420
Get out of here, sharks!

696
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:15,340
Bam!

697
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:21,460
Not even sharks are safe.

698
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,360
That's fucking right.

699
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,640
Wait, where's the oxygen tank?

700
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:28,120
There we go.

701
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:30,040
All right, more oxygen.

702
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:34,420
I did not expect this game to actually be good.

703
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:40,920
But I think I can play this game instead of whatever capture
the flag shit this random stranger wants to play with me.

704
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:43,920
Like, who the fuck plays capture the flag 1v1?

705
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:44,900
Like, what?

706
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:47,980
Bro, that's dumb.

707
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:51,280
Bro, I have like three, two more friends, bro.

708
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:53,380
I'll just make it a 2v2.

709
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,100
Find two more random friends on the forum.

710
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:57,980
Can't be that hard.

711
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:58,740
You found me.

712
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:00,480
me

713
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:12,440
like if it's just like a 1v1 lobby then that's fine but bro
wants to play capture the flag 1v1 like bro fine if you

714
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:24,060

find two more people on the port oh my god I think I did it

715
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:32,380
I think I beat the game I think it's just sharks sharks was
end game Bro, it's just nukes.

716
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,300
I'm just firing nukes right now.

717
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:38,820
Okay, I beat the game.

718
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,780
At devs, not enough content.

719
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:43,960
Thumbs down.

720
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:52,280
Yeah, you might have made a free game, but I beat it in like
less than five minutes.

721
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:53,100
Thumbs down.

722
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:55,560
Go deeper?

723
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:56,140
I can't.

724
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:57,680
This was the deepest I can go.

725
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:00,680
Wait, I think?

726
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,260
Oh, wait, I think I can go deeper.

727
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:06,180
I demand more levels!

728
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:09,160
Okay, wait.

729
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,900
Let's see if I can go deeper.

730
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,320
Yeah, see, this is the furthest I can go.

731
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:17,160
Unloughed you.

732
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:20,340
I can't really open this.

733
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:21,820
It's just a similar game, but play it.

734
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:23,440
But your last cost, here you go.

735
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:26,880
To move space to stab.

736
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:28,580
Okay, resources.

737
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,120
Graphics shops.

738
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:35,420
You actually have, like, the whole PNG of the thing, too.

739
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:36,280
Oh, that's cool.

740
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,740
Alright, what am I supposed to download again?

741
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:40,460
Wait, let me...

742
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:42,960
I need to see if I can...

743
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,140
I'm so mad.

744
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:47,980
I hate that goddamn glitch effect.

745
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:49,320
Oh!

746
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:51,780
Don't understand.

747
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,380
I don't want any of this.

748
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,140
Off!

749
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:03,000
Maybe I log out and log back in.

750
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,540
It'll do it.

751
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,080
Okay, there you go.

752
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:08,860
Log in.

753
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,180
This old-ass computer.

754
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:13,740
Alright.

755
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,080
Did it fix it?

756
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:21,700
Okay, whatever.

757
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:22,500
I don't care.

758
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:24,140
I'll talk to them.

759
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,400
I gotta restart the PC, guys.

760
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:34,300
All right, download.

761
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:44,860
Oh, it's fishing with knives.

762
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:47,240
Oh, sorry, I went back to fishing with knives.

763
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:55,310
All right.

764
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:57,390
Oh, read me.

765
00:51:57,510 --> 00:51:58,310
Thank you for downloading.

766
00:51:58,510 --> 00:52:00,370
Don't forget to leave feedback on the form.

767
00:52:00,810 --> 00:52:02,570
Service may be unstable.

768
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:06,030
Let us know you're having trouble hosting the room.

769
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:08,010
It's in it.

770
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:08,590
Okay.

771
00:52:10,590 --> 00:52:13,690
All right, let's play this game that they want me to play.

772
00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:17,730
Oh, okay.

773
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:22,400
Create room.

774
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:24,160
Set room.

775
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:26,780
1v1 me noob.

776
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:29,140
Set room size.

777
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:30,340
Two.

778
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,220
Set map.

779
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,080
All right, off.

780
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:34,540
There we go.

781
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:44,060
All right, there's two of us.

782
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:46,780
You just say he'll 1v1 me.

783
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,160
Okay.

784
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:50,540
I created the room.

785
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,620
Why is he not joining my room?

786
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:02,660
Wait, where is the map?

787
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:05,520
Where's the fucking...

788
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,000
Where's the flag area?

789
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:08,080
I'm lost already.

790
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:09,360
What?

791
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:11,700
Oh, okay.

792
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:12,920
That actually freaked me out.

793
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:13,860
I was like, what the fuck?

794
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:18,660
How do I get to the other side?

795
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:19,300
Oh, here.

796
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:22,920
Hello?

797
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:25,300
Is no one online?

798
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,480
Ha ha ha ha ha.

799
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:30,220
Hello.

800
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:35,760
Oh no, I was...

801
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,660
He was supposed to join my room.

802
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:43,720
He said create a room and then join it.

803
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:47,160
Oh, oh that scared me.

804
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,780
I don't know if it's too loud or not.

805
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,020
It's not too loud, right?

806
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:55,540
That boom Scared me a little.

807
00:53:57,820 --> 00:53:58,680
Okay, it's this way.

808
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:02,320
How many bullets do I have?

809
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:02,960
It doesn't even say.

810
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:04,120
Bro, this game...

811
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:05,700
This game is poorly designed.

812
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:06,960
This FPS game?

813
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:10,040
How the fuck am I supposed to know how many bullets I have?

814
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:10,820
Oh, I'm lost.

815
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:12,560
I am lost.

816
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:16,180
Oh, no.

817
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:17,840
Where am I?

818
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,280
How do I get to the other side?

819
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:23,480
Okay.

820
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:24,760
Okay.

821
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:27,100
I already forgot how this map was designed.

822
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:29,480
Is it this way?

823
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,300
No, this is where I got the flag.

824
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:38,900
No, it should be like here.

825
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:40,220
Wait, how many bullets do I have?

826
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,400
I have a lot of bullets.

827
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:47,220
I don't think I need a reload, guys.

828
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:51,320
The only issue is that I don't have the...

829
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,220
Don't have a crosshair.

830
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:57,820
What the fuck?

831
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:02,880
Did not go on the other side from here?

832
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:07,240
I thought I went to the other side from this way.

833
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:13,100
It's so dark.

834
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:16,200
Oh no, it's from here.

835
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:17,500
Wait.

836
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:20,780
Guys, I need a HUD.

837
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:24,000
It's so poorly designed.

838
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:25,220
I need a fucking HUD.

839
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:29,580
Don't worry, I'll win this game.

00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:43,400

843
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:04,380
Huh?

844
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:08,020
Yeah, see?

845
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:10,980
Where are you gonna do about it?

846
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:14,400
We have one minute left.

847
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,460
How would this one be one?

848
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:21,240
He just needs to show up to grab the flag and I'll be like,
pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.

849
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:22,740
Reload.

850
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,500
Come on, where is he?

851
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:30,100
Grab the flag, pussy.

852
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:32,880
I win these.

853
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,660
Come on, one minute to get here.

854
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:41,020
I'm not trying to...

855
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:42,560
No, don't tell me to look behind me.

856
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:43,320
I know I...

857
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:44,140
There's no way.

858
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:46,040
See?

859
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:47,860
It's safe.

860
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:50,000

Oh, maybe that was a mistake.

891
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:01,480
Guys, I think I should have kept, at least it was sound.

892
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:05,360

Oh, now I got the blue screen.

952
01:03:04,910 --> 01:03:08,990
Geek Squad isn't prepared for this.

953
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:20,960
Alright.

1042
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:19,220
I didn't mean to play the game.

1043
01:09:19,740 --> 01:09:20,140
Oh, exit.

1044
01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:23,500
I want to look at what else he has on his PC.

1045
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:25,140
I'm digging around his PC.

1046
01:09:26,180 --> 01:09:26,980
Soul transfer.

1047
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:28,400
Excuse me?

1048
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:31,460
Already installed.

1049
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:32,980
Is this another new game?

1050
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:51,440

1052
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:07,080
developers have this to get through the day, you know?

1053
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:10,500
Gotta have a little soul transfer before you start coding.

1054
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:12,980
Digital dark art.

1055
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:16,140
Oh my god, okay.

1056
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:18,720
Soul transit notes, all right.

1057
01:10:20,620 --> 01:10:21,840
Missing signatures.

1058
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:25,820
Oh, pen to start dumping souls.

1059
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:29,180
Match up open, crash combinations.

1060
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:33,220
Found a way to proper transfer, graphical assets to new...

1061
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:45,640
games damn even the devil yeah even the devil went digital
guys finally finally i can i can do i soon i hope they get

1062
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:52,520
an app made you know to make it more convenient don't you
just want to make deals with the devil on the on the app you

1063
01:10:52,520 --> 01:11:03,640
know it's like uber eats but uber souls play around with a
soul essence it's it's terrifying what it can do We'll need

1064
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:07,620
to find a way to intercept the souls before they altered the
game, allowing to create the game myself.

1065
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:10,720
Finish the custom edge and connected it to the infuse tab.

1066
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:13,760
I'm now able to intercept the souls before they get their
hands on my game.

1067
01:11:13,940 --> 01:11:15,540
With the editor, I can use the soul mechanics.

1068
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:16,040
How I please.

1069
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:17,860
What the fuck is this game?

1070
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:20,640
Yeah.

1071
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:23,100
Double dash delivery.

1072
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:24,800
Good.

1073
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:27,000
Maybe one.

1074
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:28,820
We're all just waiting for the day.

1075
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:30,840
Satan comes out with the new app.

1076
01:11:31,660 --> 01:11:32,900
Just to make it more convenient.

1077
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:43,280
convenience now right seems can only exist when external
influence the mechanics and visuals remain mine to use

1078
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:47,980
though which is the most important part confirm that
destroying game soul through my editor doesn't influence the

1079
01:11:47,980 --> 01:11:54,120
original game in any way good thing otherwise a lot of games
were already been destroyed I noticed older versions of the

1080
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:59,000
prototype have lost their soul create a new version of the
game seems to destroy the previous soul of the game you need

1081
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:08,540
to research more oh my god what the fuck so like every add
on to this game that he does, um, has a soil in it.

1082
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:12,540
File Explorer.

1083
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:13,680
What does he have?

1084
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:15,580
Oh, hey, that's mine.

1085
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:17,240
Wait, that's my files.

1086
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:19,620
Wait, Scara?

1087
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:25,740
I guess that was her pictures.

1088
01:12:30,740 --> 01:12:32,060
There's Sarah's pictures.

1089
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:36,440
Update menu looks confusing.

1090
01:12:36,860 --> 01:12:37,340
Mine's equal.

1091
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:37,820
20.

1092
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:40,160
That's cute.

1093
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:42,660
He has serious pictures in here.

1094
01:12:43,740 --> 01:12:45,600
I guess I play the game now.

1095
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:47,500
Oh, I can't move this.

1096
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,060
But I have anything else in the browser?

1097
01:12:52,780 --> 01:12:54,580
Why is he bookmarked?

1098
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:55,640
Oh, John Mollard.

1099
01:12:59,450 --> 01:13:05,550
I'm saying on this blog to post updates about my work,
expect mostly in-progress screenshots and ramblings on games

1100
01:13:05,550 --> 01:13:06,350
I'm working on.

1101
01:13:06,850 --> 01:13:08,890
For the few who ran into this Vlog?

1102
01:13:09,390 --> 01:13:11,370
Don't know me?

1103
01:13:11,490 --> 01:13:12,250
Here's a little introduction.

1104
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:13,030
I'm John.

1105
01:13:13,550 --> 01:13:14,710
During the day, I'm a student at night.

1106
01:13:14,830 --> 01:13:18,310
I work on... Yeah, little hobby game projects.

1107
01:13:18,630 --> 01:13:21,350
Yeah, including soul transfer.

1108
01:13:24,770 --> 01:13:26,550
Yeah, very, very little.

1109
01:13:28,110 --> 01:13:32,610
I've been doing this for about half a year now, so my game
design skills are not great.

1110
01:13:34,210 --> 01:13:35,430
Yeah, no, that's crazy.

1111
01:13:35,670 --> 01:13:37,370
I like how it's like little...

1112
01:13:38,590 --> 01:13:39,450
hobby games.

1113
01:13:39,550 --> 01:13:41,310
And also the dark arts, you know?

1114
01:13:43,170 --> 01:13:44,730
What a great hobby.

1115
01:13:45,530 --> 01:13:47,150
Okay, hello block, clock game.

1116
01:13:50,590 --> 01:13:51,290
Because I'm not far.

1117
01:13:51,390 --> 01:13:52,810
I had trouble with my weird system.

1118
01:13:53,010 --> 01:13:54,630
But I think it really played out.

1119
01:13:54,710 --> 01:13:55,750
I hope you enjoy it.

1120
01:13:55,810 --> 01:13:56,530
Alright, what's this?

1121
01:14:02,370 --> 01:14:05,110
Yeah, I can't wait for their new DLC Blood Sacrifice.

1122
01:14:06,050 --> 01:14:08,030
Alright, clock game version 1.

1123
01:14:10,290 --> 01:14:17,000
what's in clock game look at the time

1124
01:14:20,570 --> 01:14:33,650
okay time has stopped win back the hours by racing the hour
hand swing the pendulum back and forth to make the minute

1125
01:14:33,650 --> 01:14:43,490
hand take a full circle before the back hand reaches he make
it to midnight swing swing pendulum big swings take longer

1126
01:14:43,490 --> 01:14:48,290
but make stupid game.

1127
01:14:53,390 --> 01:14:54,510
Let's go.

1128
01:14:57,650 --> 01:14:58,510
That's right.

1129
01:15:00,010 --> 01:15:01,030
I'm gonna win.

1130
01:15:07,230 --> 01:15:07,610
That's right.

1131
01:15:09,290 --> 01:15:10,850
Can't catch me.

1132
01:15:11,290 --> 01:15:13,770
On the high octane gameplay.

1133
01:15:14,110 --> 01:15:16,230
I wonder why this game never took off, guys.

1134
01:15:16,690 --> 01:15:19,230
It has everything.

1135
01:15:19,350 --> 01:15:22,150
The adrenaline rush as you race against the clock.

1136
01:15:23,150 --> 01:15:23,890
Yeah!

1137
01:15:25,150 --> 01:15:25,710
Level 2?

1138
01:15:29,990 --> 01:15:31,830
Oh my god, there's a level 2.

1139
01:15:32,950 --> 01:15:34,480
How many levels are there?

1140
01:15:40,890 --> 01:15:41,850
That's right.

1141
01:15:43,230 --> 01:15:45,130
I'm so confused.

1142
01:15:45,410 --> 01:15:47,250
What is this game about?

1143
01:15:48,150 --> 01:15:49,770
No players online.

1144
01:15:50,290 --> 01:15:51,350
It's just me.

1145
01:15:51,990 --> 01:15:53,190
I'm just on the PC.

1146
01:15:53,210 --> 01:15:54,290
by myself.

1147
01:15:58,690 --> 01:16:00,210
Okay, no, this game sucks.

1148
01:16:00,850 --> 01:16:03,110
I'll leave a review to say your game's trash.

1149
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:08,080
The game fucking sucks!

1150
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:11,780
I want to leave a review right now!

1151
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:13,940
No, it's this.

1152
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:16,680
I took a long to finish this one.

1153
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:19,480
Lots of bugs because the engine is still in an early state.

1154
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:22,280
I want to review bomb his games.

1155
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:25,720
All right, dungeon blade.

1156
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:27,120
Maybe this game is better.

1157
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:33,020
Yeah, no wonder there's no players in these stupid games.

1158
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:35,260
Dungeon blade.

1159
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:41,920
Maybe you shouldn't say this to the guy who's transferring
souls.

1160
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:43,260
What is he gonna do?

1161
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:44,560
Transfer my soul?

1162
01:16:44,860 --> 01:16:45,920
Good luck with that.

1163
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:48,500
I'm behind the computer screen.

1164
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:50,300
I'm VPN on.

1165
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:51,600
He doesn't know where I live.

1166
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:53,940
You can't transfer my soul.

1167
01:16:54,580 --> 01:16:56,780
They trap you and all you have to do is your trusty blade.

1168
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:57,820
You must escape.

1169
01:16:58,140 --> 01:17:01,940
Battle your way to freedom through a tricky dungeon full of
coolish flows.

1170
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:04,440
Featuring state of the art, three-dimensional graphics.

1171
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:08,740
Space, move forward, left, and right.

1172
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:09,380
All right.

1173
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:13,580
Maybe this game will be better than what the clock thing.

1174
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:15,620
They trap you in the dungeon.

1175
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:21,120
All you have, you must escape.

1176
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:21,900
All right.

1177
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:25,760
Dungeon Blade.

1178
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:28,460
Oh shit.

1179
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:35,080
Bam!

1180
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:36,020
Bam!

1181
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:37,500
That's right.

1182
01:17:41,570 --> 01:17:43,770
Oh my god, I wish they used WASD.

1183
01:17:45,130 --> 01:17:46,750
Wait, it's just the same level.

1184
01:17:48,010 --> 01:17:48,610
Oh shit.

1185
01:17:48,930 --> 01:17:50,010
Oh shit, this is a wizard!

1186
01:17:50,210 --> 01:17:51,610
Oh no, I'm taking damage!

1187
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:56,530
Damn, this is...

1188
01:17:56,550 --> 01:17:57,690
This is a hard game, guys.

1189
01:17:58,510 --> 01:17:59,810
Oh my god, it's the bats again.

1190
01:18:02,190 --> 01:18:04,350
Does this just repeat itself over and over?

1191
01:18:05,370 --> 01:18:06,730
How would I ever get out?

1192
01:18:06,810 --> 01:18:07,850
Oh, wait, no, this is a new room.

1193
01:18:08,070 --> 01:18:10,110
Oh, shit, there's a fucking skeleton!

1194
01:18:11,330 --> 01:18:12,410
Oh, no, what do I do?

1195
01:18:13,490 --> 01:18:15,050
Oh, my god, he's hitting me.

1196
01:18:15,930 --> 01:18:16,290
No!

1197
01:18:18,430 --> 01:18:19,450
I'm reviewing bomb.

1198
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:21,650
I'm reviewing bombing this game because I died.

1199
01:18:22,430 --> 01:18:24,230
It's not because I was bad at this game.

1200
01:18:24,310 --> 01:18:25,610
It's because this game sucked.

1201
01:18:28,890 --> 01:18:34,550
it's been a while i've got married her name is sarah and
she's an artist her work is really incredible here's a

1202
01:18:34,550 --> 01:18:40,950
picture i've quit my position as a researcher and moved to
berlin with sarah i started a game company it's called

1203
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:49,710
together so my colleagues are busy expanding work on the
shooter game oh this is the game that he's been doing oh

1204
01:18:49,710 --> 01:18:51,350
this is when he stopped doing it

1205
01:18:54,990 --> 01:18:59,870
all right game journalist mode it's not because I was bad at
this game.

1206
01:19:00,030 --> 01:19:01,270
It's because it sucked.

1207
01:19:02,090 --> 01:19:02,950
There's a difference.

1208
01:19:03,170 --> 01:19:03,410
Oh wait.

1209
01:19:03,590 --> 01:19:04,070
Can I talk?

1210
01:19:04,190 --> 01:19:05,330
Oh, I should talk to him.

1211
01:19:05,410 --> 01:19:06,150
I should talk to him.

1212
01:19:06,170 --> 01:19:07,890
And be like, where the fuck were you, Quinn?

1213
01:19:11,870 --> 01:19:13,810
Yeah, I'm here with a game journalist review.

1214
01:19:13,970 --> 01:19:15,090
It's not because I was bad.

1215
01:19:15,150 --> 01:19:17,470
It's because the game just didn't cater to me.

1216
01:19:19,570 --> 01:19:20,530
Who's this guy?

1217
01:19:24,170 --> 01:19:26,770
Any progress on the no clip plug?

1218
01:19:27,350 --> 01:19:28,070
It's incredibly hard.

1219
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:29,890
I'll check around to see if anyone recorded the video.

1220
01:19:30,150 --> 01:19:30,670
told you.

1221
01:19:30,810 --> 01:19:32,050
This guy was cheating.

1222
01:19:32,770 --> 01:19:33,930
Fucking knew it.

1223
01:19:34,150 --> 01:19:34,510
Alright, Quinn.

1224
01:19:34,630 --> 01:19:35,670
Oh, there's this guy, is.

1225
01:19:39,470 --> 01:19:40,110
It's here.

1226
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:41,250
We've discovered any bugs.

1227
01:19:41,330 --> 01:19:42,910
Hey, John, how's development of the game going?

1228
01:19:43,230 --> 01:19:45,850
Me and some of the people are still playing the Alphabash
and are loving it.

1229
01:19:46,110 --> 01:19:48,170
Can't wait for another official playtest.

1230
01:19:49,250 --> 01:19:49,610
Okay.

1231
01:19:51,030 --> 01:19:51,910

1232
01:19:54,230 --> 01:19:58,450

of its competition.

01:19:58,750 --> 01:19:59,430

1234
01:19:59,630 --> 01:20:00,190

Alright, there we go.

1245
01:21:24,150 --> 01:21:24,970
There we go.

1246
01:21:28,070 --> 01:21:30,590
Look, I'm just trying to do the path.

1247
01:21:31,390 --> 01:21:32,870
That'll stop them.

1248
01:21:35,330 --> 01:21:37,230
Good old 1993.

1249
01:21:38,550 --> 01:21:40,130
Wait a minute.

1250
01:21:40,610 --> 01:21:41,730
Oh, it's the pathway.

1251
01:21:43,530 --> 01:21:45,210
Oh, hey, it's that scary now.

1252
01:21:46,750 --> 01:21:48,110
Got him.

1253
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:53,960
Oh, it has sound effects now.

1254
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:59,400
Oh, wait, this version is like a more polished version.

1255
01:21:59,580 --> 01:22:00,280
It has sound effects.

1256
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:00,600
Look.

1257
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:01,120
Huh.

1258
01:22:02,260 --> 01:22:02,500
Huh.

1259
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:03,080
Huh.

1260
01:22:03,860 --> 01:22:05,880
Look at that.

1261
01:22:10,250 --> 01:22:13,370
Oh, I have to wait for players to start the game.

1262
01:22:14,150 --> 01:22:14,570
Boo!

1263
01:22:20,580 --> 01:22:22,520

01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:36,620
Um, yeah, this is a programmer's PC.

1266
01:22:36,740 --> 01:22:37,860
Of course it's strong.

1267
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:42,600
Guys, I have, like, 2 megabytes in this PC right now.

1268
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:47,220
Not to brag or anything.

1269
01:22:50,180 --> 01:22:53,260
Yeah, 2 whole megabytes.

1270
01:22:53,820 --> 01:22:54,380
Exactly.

1271
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:00,880
Damn.

1272
01:23:01,580 --> 01:23:02,260
Damn.

1273
01:23:03,380 --> 01:23:18,180
groundbreaking I know that's like two million bytes exactly
where the fuck is where are the players someone play with me

1274
01:23:18,180 --> 01:23:29,560

back.

1276
01:23:37,170 --> 01:23:38,230
You're not going to go in bathroom break.

1277
01:23:38,310 --> 01:23:39,450
Maybe someone will show up.

1278
01:23:39,730 --> 01:23:40,770
I'll be right back.

1279
01:24:47,190 --> 01:24:47,250
Many.

1280
01:24:47,690 --> 01:24:50,610
But so, Nexi, thank you for the super chat.

01:24:50,830 --> 01:24:50,930
Thank you.

1282
01:24:51,270 --> 01:24:51,670
Thank you.

1283
01:24:52,210 --> 01:24:53,590
Any players went online?

1284
01:24:57,290 --> 01:24:59,270
There's still no players online?

1285
01:25:01,010 --> 01:25:02,350
Where are the players?

1286
01:25:02,610 --> 01:25:04,130
Am I even supposed to be here?

1287
01:25:05,130 --> 01:25:09,510
I swear to God, this is like, oh my God, this is where the
puzzle is, isn't it?

1288
01:25:10,230 --> 01:25:10,670
Oh.

1289
01:25:16,100 --> 01:25:17,060
Wait, I...

1290
01:25:17,060 --> 01:25:17,920
Wait, there was?

1291
01:25:18,580 --> 01:25:19,460
What happened?

1292
01:25:25,190 --> 01:25:26,130
What happened?

1293
01:25:27,810 --> 01:25:28,570
They just left.

1294
01:25:28,770 --> 01:25:30,470
They said hi, but no one answered.

1295
01:25:31,310 --> 01:25:32,870
Oh, is it because I put a password?

1296
01:25:33,490 --> 01:25:34,810
Oh, maybe that's why.

1297
01:25:35,530 --> 01:25:35,910
Okay.

1298
01:25:36,930 --> 01:25:38,050
I'll create another game.

1299
01:25:40,330 --> 01:25:43,470
He said a gamer word and got bad.

1300
01:25:45,970 --> 01:25:47,010

01:26:21,350 --> 01:26:22,210
Does anyone want to play?

1307
01:26:23,590 --> 01:26:26,450
I have an empty room right now.

1308
01:26:28,730 --> 01:26:29,090
Hello?

1309
01:26:32,310 --> 01:26:34,270
Do you want to join my room?

1310
01:26:37,580 --> 01:26:39,500
Any room joiners?

1311
01:26:42,620 --> 01:26:45,520
Can I do like one play and then I just play by myself?

1312
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:55,240
Yeah, I got the speedrun tech locked in now i don't

unlimited ammo now did we did i download the wrong path

1315
01:27:22,890 --> 01:27:25,630
Maybe I download the wrong patch, you know?

1316
01:27:25,850 --> 01:27:29,770
Everyone's on, like, 1.3, and I'm on 1.2.

1317
01:27:31,910 --> 01:27:33,130
Maybe that's why.

1318
01:27:33,530 --> 01:27:35,130
You know, it's not because I have no friends.

1319
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:38,110
It's just, like, you know, I just have the wrong patch
downloaded.

1320
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:42,230
I feel like I...

1321
01:27:42,230 --> 01:27:43,410
I feel like this is a puzzle.

1322
01:27:44,910 --> 01:27:46,630
Yeah, I'm on Overwatch 1.

1323
01:27:48,570 --> 01:27:49,710
Not patient enough.

1324
01:27:49,810 --> 01:27:50,450
Fuck this.

1325
01:27:53,850 --> 01:27:56,810
I'm pretty sure this is a puzzle I have to figure out.

1326
01:27:57,250 --> 01:27:58,290
Is it a soul transfer?

1327
01:27:58,470 --> 01:28:00,670
Am I supposed to transfer a soul right now?

1328
01:28:00,970 --> 01:28:01,530
John!

1329
01:28:02,230 --> 01:28:02,470
Alright.

1330
01:28:03,250 --> 01:28:05,250
I'm gonna go transfer a soul real quick.

1331
01:28:06,170 --> 01:28:06,290
Okay.

1332
01:28:06,730 --> 01:28:06,850
Oh!

1333
01:28:07,130 --> 01:28:08,190
Game one!

1334
01:28:09,790 --> 01:28:10,270
Oh!

1335
01:28:13,850 --> 01:28:14,950
What a game.

1336
01:28:16,730 --> 01:28:17,770
Transfer soul.

1337
01:28:18,630 --> 01:28:19,270
Oh no?

1338
01:28:21,090 --> 01:28:22,210
Not mine, feel?

1339
01:28:26,610 --> 01:28:29,090
Oh, is it one of the games I downloaded?

1340
01:28:30,110 --> 01:28:30,530
Let's see.

1341
01:28:35,170 --> 01:28:37,530
What were my other games I downloaded?

1342
01:28:38,270 --> 01:28:39,550
I fucking knew it.

1343
01:28:40,490 --> 01:28:43,530
Alright, what other souls did you infuse in your game, sir?

1344
01:28:44,330 --> 01:28:45,630
Maybe dungeon blade.

1345
01:28:48,150 --> 01:28:48,730
Oh, shit.

1346
01:28:48,870 --> 01:28:50,450
Wait, there was a soul in that game?

1347
01:28:51,190 --> 01:28:51,650
Okay.

1348
01:28:52,230 --> 01:28:55,850
Oh my god, what the fuck?

1349
01:28:56,630 --> 01:28:56,990
Alright.

1350
01:29:00,090 --> 01:29:01,010
Oh.

1351
01:29:01,870 --> 01:29:03,530
How do I play it?

1352
01:29:05,110 --> 01:29:06,030
Alright.

1353
01:29:07,910 --> 01:29:09,610
That's not cool.

1354
01:29:11,190 --> 01:29:11,710
Oh.

1355
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:16,620
Looks like a fun game.

1356
01:29:20,670 --> 01:29:21,710
I did it.

1357
01:29:22,110 --> 01:29:23,290
I beat the game.

1358
01:29:25,830 --> 01:29:27,830
Is that how you guys do game development?

1359
01:29:32,380 --> 01:29:33,080
Oh.

1360
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:35,940
Oh.

1361
01:29:36,860 --> 01:29:37,120
Oh.

1362
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:38,960
Oh.

1363
01:29:39,860 --> 01:29:44,380
This is how game development works, guys.

1364
01:29:53,770 --> 01:29:54,010
Oh.

1365
01:29:56,770 --> 01:29:58,830
Okay, that should have been over.

1366
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:03,360
Yeah!

1367
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:06,080
Oh, my God.

1368
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:13,000
Oh.

1369
01:30:13,020 --> 01:30:13,680
How the fuck?

1370
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:14,560
Okay.

1371
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:24,320
Nice!

1372
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:25,340
I did it!

1373
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:29,600
Oh my god.

1374
01:30:29,780 --> 01:30:30,300
How the fuck?

1375
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:34,520
Okay, how the...

1376
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:35,260
Okay.

1377
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:37,440
Okay.

1378
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:41,080
I'm faster than this.

1379
01:30:41,980 --> 01:30:42,540
There we go.

1380
01:30:43,140 --> 01:30:44,200
I told you I'm faster.

1381
01:30:44,700 --> 01:30:45,860
Okay, I didn't realize there was more.

1382
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:47,980
Um...

1383
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:53,100
Okay, I am faster.

1384
01:30:53,300 --> 01:30:54,500
I have the button-in-mash power.

1385
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:00,970
God damn it.

1386
01:31:04,980 --> 01:31:06,960
How did I do it?

1387
01:31:08,220 --> 01:31:08,720
There we go.

1388
01:31:09,060 --> 01:31:09,810
That's how I did it.

1389
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:15,380
Okay.

1390
01:31:16,700 --> 01:31:19,540
I have a perfectly good explanation for this.

1391
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:24,540
Oh my god.

1392
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:25,110
Come on.

1393
01:31:29,100 --> 01:31:29,480
Okay.

1394
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:34,020
Nice.

1395
01:31:36,140 --> 01:31:37,780
How many fucking...

1396
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:40,160
Alright.

1397
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,100
This is a bad game.

1398
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:43,500
Can I move?

1399
01:31:43,620 --> 01:31:45,980
Can I put another game in here?

1400
01:31:47,980 --> 01:31:48,540
Separate.

1401
01:31:49,980 --> 01:31:51,480
This is a bad game.

1402
01:31:52,940 --> 01:31:54,820
Maybe I'll put clock tower in.

1403
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:56,400
Transfer so.

1404
01:31:57,740 --> 01:32:00,580
Bro, I don't think game development is it for this guy.

1405
01:32:01,160 --> 01:32:02,460
I think he's gotta stop.

1406
01:32:03,180 --> 01:32:03,360
Oops.

1407
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:04,400
Wait, I don't need a transfer.

1408
01:32:06,980 --> 01:32:10,080
Honestly, think maybe you should start a new career.

1409
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:12,690
I don't think game development is it.

1410
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:17,220
What the?

1411
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:22,540
Okay.

1412
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:27,260
The green wire!

1413
01:32:27,900 --> 01:32:28,640
Nice, I did it.

1414
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:29,460
I saved the world.

1415
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:31,400
It was that easy.

1416
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:32,960
I won the game.

1417
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:37,040
I beat the game, guys.

1418
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:38,200
I did it.

1419
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:42,000
It's always the green wire.

1420
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:42,940
Watch this.

1421
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:54,700
Apparently it's not always the green wire.

1422
01:32:55,780 --> 01:32:55,980
Wait!

1423
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:01,400
Is it because it's not evil enough?

1424
01:33:02,180 --> 01:33:04,720
Is it because the game isn't evil enough?

1425
01:33:07,580 --> 01:33:10,620
I can only transfer it with...

1426
01:33:10,620 --> 01:33:11,380
Wait, is it?

1427
01:33:11,480 --> 01:33:14,140
only transferable with...

1428
01:33:14,140 --> 01:33:15,400
Wait, where's the other game?

1429
01:33:16,420 --> 01:33:17,220
What is this?

1430
01:33:18,180 --> 01:33:20,700
Wait, does that mean I can put fish with knives in there?

1431
01:33:21,700 --> 01:33:23,280
Oh, no, I can't.

1432
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:25,840
What do I do now?

1433
01:33:27,460 --> 01:33:29,260
Wait, can I put a picture in it?

1434
01:33:30,820 --> 01:33:32,660
Maybe I put Sarah's picture in here.

1435
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:33,900
No?

1436
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:36,180
Alright, John.

1437
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:37,620
What other games have you made?

1438
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:42,840
Alright.

1439
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:46,180
What other He only made two games.

1440
01:33:47,540 --> 01:33:48,600
What else can I transfer?

1441
01:33:49,660 --> 01:33:51,180
He's only made two.

1442
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:55,300
Not even, like, good games out of there.

1443
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:57,020
Not even two good games.

1444
01:34:05,260 --> 01:34:06,700
That's similar enough souls.

1445
01:34:09,680 --> 01:34:11,460
Place the vessel in the middle of the slot.

1446
01:34:11,720 --> 01:34:12,520
Place a fitting cell.

1447
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:16,600
Press soul essence from the soul will be infused into the
vessel game.

1448
01:34:16,620 --> 01:34:19,340
Opening game immediately will allow the server to do
whatever they want.

1449
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:22,380
It's best to open the game through the editor and implement
mechanics.

1450
01:34:22,740 --> 01:34:23,640
What the fuck?

1451
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:26,160
Vessel.

1452
01:34:28,040 --> 01:34:29,520
Where the fuck is the game?

1453
01:34:29,780 --> 01:34:29,980
Okay.

1454
01:34:33,660 --> 01:34:35,120
Is this what you guys do?

1455
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:39,320
Is this coding?

1456
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:41,200
Am I coding?

1457
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:43,360
You're confused.

1458
01:34:46,870 --> 01:34:49,030
Is this what coding is?

1459
01:34:50,310 --> 01:34:52,510
What's the fitting stone to correct us to that?

1460
01:34:53,190 --> 01:34:54,470
I don't have another stone.

1461
01:34:56,750 --> 01:34:57,970
Where are all the stones?

1462
01:34:59,570 --> 01:35:01,530
These are all just stupid notes.

1463
01:35:06,250 --> 01:35:06,770
Infuse.

1464
01:35:12,740 --> 01:35:14,860
Wait, that is how he code his game.

1465
01:35:14,980 --> 01:35:16,340
No use in playing with souls.

1466
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:17,820
Who did he murder?

1467
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:20,800
Where did this guy go?

1468
01:35:20,820 --> 01:35:30,320
get all these souls and then destroys the souls in the prop
bro okay one soul is visual oh my imagine your soul is being

1469
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:34,060
used for a shitty ass game like that sucks bro

1470
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:47,680
they took your soul and you were made for a shitty ass
capture the flag game some fucking golden eye rip off too

1471
01:35:47,680 --> 01:35:57,930
that's the worst part your soul was used to make a golden I
rip off who became mind sweeper

1472
01:36:01,390 --> 01:36:12,870
yeah I oh man it took my soul and I'm an AI gotcha slop game
yeah imagine they took your soul and you're made into those

1473
01:36:12,870 --> 01:36:27,040
like phone app games the fucking was that a garden game I
don't have I don't have any more stones in here john you're

1474
01:36:27,040 --> 01:36:35,380
not helping at all great game that behave unlike any of the
gameplay is much more abstract unusual and no story i'll

1475
01:36:35,380 --> 01:36:40,880
suddenly have a story tell me highly unusual are the souls
trying to communicate continue playing the game transformed

1476
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:47,180
into the stone the game crash and the icon transformed into
a stone right in front of my eyes i'll do more research of

1477
01:36:47,180 --> 01:36:54,200
this stone but it seems very stable oh it's inconsistent
with the glitches but the song is calm to potentially use.

1478
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:57,900
Before, I can assume they contain the souls of the original
games, but it's much more than that.

1479
01:36:58,280 --> 01:36:59,580
I think it's their pure essence.

1480
01:36:59,940 --> 01:37:02,700
Create a rudimentary version of what would be the infuse
tab.

1481
01:37:03,180 --> 01:37:04,920
Use the stone into a simple game I made.

1482
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:05,740
It's unbelievable.

1483
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:08,500
I had all the stone mechanics rambling placed throughout.

1484
01:37:08,640 --> 01:37:10,720
It's as if these souls created their own gameplay.

1485
01:37:10,860 --> 01:37:12,300
What the fuck?

1486
01:37:12,740 --> 01:37:14,720
What is going on?

1487
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:21,040
Did I finish the bomb dungeon blade for a stone?

1488
01:37:21,220 --> 01:37:22,120
Oh, maybe.

1489
01:37:22,700 --> 01:37:23,260
Alright.

1490
01:37:24,220 --> 01:37:25,500
I guess I'll infuse this.

1491
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:27,680
Maybe I'll get a stone out of it.

1492
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:31,060
Do I have to finish their mini-game to get a goddamn stone?

1493
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:34,640
Yeah, I did the...

1494
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:38,860
Because, like, these two games didn't combine.

1495
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:41,060
Yeah.

1496
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:44,440
I have to combine, like, these games.

1497
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:47,880
Wait, what?

1498
01:37:54,230 --> 01:37:55,210
Wait, what?

1499
01:38:01,700 --> 01:38:03,480
Oh, they're not combining anymore.

1500
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:06,200
Oh, that's weird.

1501
01:38:07,580 --> 01:38:08,940
Where's my mind sweeper?

1502
01:38:10,240 --> 01:38:10,760
Oh, no.

1503
01:38:10,860 --> 01:38:12,080
Where did my mind sweeper go?

1504
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:13,160
Oh, no.

1505
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:14,220
I don't know where I...

1506
01:38:14,220 --> 01:38:16,000
I don't know where I...

1507
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,800
Oh, it was mind sweeper?

1508
01:38:18,140 --> 01:38:19,780
Wait, where did I put mind sweeper?

1509
01:38:21,340 --> 01:38:22,400
Oh, there it is.

1510
01:38:24,920 --> 01:38:25,280
Alright.

1511
01:38:25,460 --> 01:38:26,560
I have four games.

1512
01:38:26,640 --> 01:38:28,480
Wait, I can also have fish with knives, too.

1513
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:33,180
Wait, maybe I can combine fish with knives with minesweeper.

1514
01:38:33,860 --> 01:38:36,920
Oh my god, what game, what beautiful game am I gonna get
from this?

1515
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:41,000
Alright.

1516
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:46,400
Oh, oh yeah, I don't know what I expected.

1517
01:38:50,910 --> 01:38:51,830
Oh wait, no, I'm alive.

1518
01:38:52,270 --> 01:38:52,990
It's fine.

1519
01:38:54,590 --> 01:38:55,690
I'd have to go down.

1520
01:38:58,470 --> 01:38:59,390
Fishing with mines.

1521
01:39:01,890 --> 01:39:03,390
I can hit everything.

1522
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:09,080
I mean, it would be easier if I just went down.

1523
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:10,080
What the fuck?

1524
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:13,440
Oh.

1525
01:39:15,660 --> 01:39:16,660
I mean, it doesn't really matter.

1526
01:39:16,900 --> 01:39:18,060
Like, I'm tanky as hell.

1527
01:39:18,340 --> 01:39:18,420
Whoa.

1528
01:39:24,490 --> 01:39:26,130
Don't worry, I can tank it.

1529
01:39:28,690 --> 01:39:30,310
Yeah, I did it.

1530
01:39:32,190 --> 01:39:34,090
I beat the game?

1531
01:39:35,370 --> 01:39:35,590
Oh.

1532
01:39:35,630 --> 01:39:42,750

any other games

01:40:45,180 --> 01:40:47,840
All right, I'm going to see if I can go into someone's
else's games.

1538
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:49,720
Releases and work in progress.

01:43:02,620 --> 01:43:03,740
That's so real.

1567
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:07,020
Sometimes in the afternoon.

1568
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:12,520
Why I think it was a good idea to sign up for the summer
program.

1569
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:14,700
My name is Park 23 years old.

1570
01:43:14,940 --> 01:43:17,500
I'm a master student in the true sense of the word.

1571
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:19,260
The more viruses.

1572
01:43:19,820 --> 01:43:21,160
I mean this PC is already fucked.

1573
01:43:23,480 --> 01:43:25,320
So have all the malware fight each other.

1574
01:43:28,640 --> 01:43:34,920
it's summer i find myself once again in the classroom next
summer i should just focus on myself spend some quality time

1575
01:43:34,920 --> 01:43:41,280
doing nothing for a change and wait i forgot to write my
thesis next year okay these are worries for later let's try

1576
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:52,430
to sit through this class first and press yellow use the
space bot to interact with the story element oh my god oh

1577
01:43:52,430 --> 01:44:01,210
this is so old school i think this guy is dosing off mr
science going over the same chapter we did last week i think

1578
01:44:01,210 --> 01:44:03,150
nobody has the courage to tell him.

1579
01:44:04,090 --> 01:44:04,490
Right.

1580
01:44:05,650 --> 01:44:06,170
Oh, window.

1581
01:44:06,890 --> 01:44:07,630
Looks like it's pretty messy.

1582
01:44:07,850 --> 01:44:10,090
I'll probably ring later if this is still in succession.

1583
01:44:13,010 --> 01:44:13,810
I'm so sleepy.

1584
01:44:14,150 --> 01:44:15,450
I shouldn't have gotten that dorm room.

1585
01:44:15,570 --> 01:44:17,090
It's always so loud there at night.

1586
01:44:17,470 --> 01:44:18,930
At least it's nice and quiet here.

1587
01:44:19,310 --> 01:44:21,870
Maybe I can just close my eyes for a little bit.

1588
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:27,240
Oh!

1589
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:29,080
Wake up, sleepyhead!

1590
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:30,800
Oh, is that the love interest?

1591
01:44:32,460 --> 01:44:34,680
I'm in your class and in an hour go, silly.

1592
01:44:34,820 --> 01:44:37,120
Shoot, did I just slip through the whole class?

1593
01:44:38,060 --> 01:44:40,260
Oh, I don't know about you, but I'm heading out.

1594
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:42,600
I like to hang out around in empty classrooms.

1595
01:44:42,980 --> 01:44:44,120
That's your business.

1596
01:44:44,340 --> 01:44:44,840
Tee-hee.

1597
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:46,840
Oh my gosh, she's so cute.

1598
01:44:47,260 --> 01:44:47,740
Who is that?

1599
01:44:47,940 --> 01:44:49,140
I don't think she's in my class.

1600
01:44:49,720 --> 01:44:50,920
She's kind of cute.

1601
01:44:51,580 --> 01:44:54,260
Anyways, I should head out before it starts raining.

1602
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:57,320
I swear to you guys, I play through 20 days.

1603
01:44:59,720 --> 01:45:02,740
The cicadas drown out the sound on the road behind me.

1604
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:08,420
Stepping up from the air-conditioned building, hit with a
sweltering humidity luckily the log in front of the entrance

1605
01:45:08,420 --> 01:45:16,480

Alright, wait, oops.

Alright, let's see.

1616
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,540
Summer day, live fish with knives.

1617
01:46:20,060 --> 01:46:21,040
Oh my god.

1618
01:46:21,200 --> 01:46:22,580
Bark, bark, bark.

1619
01:46:23,200 --> 01:46:23,720
Wait!

1620
01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:26,800

1625
01:46:57,840 --> 01:47:02,400
Guys, I think the fish game has a fucking dog in it.

1626
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:06,200
Should I be okay?

1627
01:47:07,340 --> 01:47:08,160
Oh, okay.

1628
01:47:09,200 --> 01:47:09,780
What's wrong, Nina?

1629
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:10,700
You see something?

1630
01:47:14,600 --> 01:47:15,860
Nina, what do you see, Nina?

1631
01:47:17,720 --> 01:47:19,400
I'm having trouble seeing where you're going.

1632
01:47:20,060 --> 01:47:20,640
Keep going.

1633
01:47:21,180 --> 01:47:22,540
I mean, that's the only option.

1634
01:47:29,650 --> 01:47:31,630
You hear the still water of the lake.

1635
01:47:33,490 --> 01:47:34,010
Okay.

1636
01:47:34,030 --> 01:47:37,450
You notice you can't see Nina anymore.

1637
01:47:40,150 --> 01:47:41,350
Can't see anything.

1638
01:47:45,170 --> 01:47:47,390
Decided to keep going.

1639
01:47:48,070 --> 01:47:53,870
Oh hey, a stone!

1640
01:47:57,070 --> 01:47:57,910
Okay.

1641
01:47:59,430 --> 01:48:02,330
Okay, we got a stone now.

1642
01:48:05,030 --> 01:48:16,270

1647
01:49:11,860 --> 01:49:19,300
I love CTF Gorge Oh Oh my god, we have story mode now.

1648
01:49:20,220 --> 01:49:22,180
A pool of water bridges an unfriendly gap.

1649
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:25,280
Feelings of sitting in a lake with friends stir up inside
you.

1650
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:26,500
Look, there's fish.

1651
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:29,160
Watching from across the lake.

1652
01:49:31,660 --> 01:49:32,280
The fish?

1653
01:49:32,860 --> 01:49:34,660
Look, it's the fish with knives.

1654
01:49:37,040 --> 01:49:38,360
Oh hey, there's the flag.

1655
01:49:38,980 --> 01:49:40,180
Oh, it's bugging out.

1656
01:49:41,700 --> 01:49:43,720
The flag rests in an unfamiliar place.

1657
01:49:44,180 --> 01:49:44,660
Why here?

1658
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:47,980
Yes, visual novel, FPS.

1659
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:50,680
Actually, I think there's a good reason.

1660
01:49:51,240 --> 01:49:52,600
The other one's just playing messy.

1661
01:49:53,060 --> 01:49:53,780
It was up to him.

1662
01:49:54,100 --> 01:49:55,980
The whole map will be underwater by now.

1663
01:49:56,140 --> 01:49:56,880
Wait, who's him?

1664
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:02,820
Wait, why can't I get the...

1665
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:04,120
Hello?

1666
01:50:05,900 --> 01:50:08,040
Is there any flag on the other side?

1667
01:50:12,820 --> 01:50:13,260
Oh.

1668
01:50:14,540 --> 01:50:16,820
At last, the player reaches the blue base.

1669
01:50:17,400 --> 01:50:17,960
The flag.

1670
01:50:18,160 --> 01:50:19,580
Oh no, this is all wrong.

1671
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:21,320
I'll talk with the other one.

1672
01:50:21,820 --> 01:50:23,160
He's hard to talk to.

1673
01:50:25,680 --> 01:50:25,960
Oh, look.

1674
01:50:26,060 --> 01:50:27,580
See, there's the fish with knives.

1675
01:50:28,480 --> 01:50:30,700
There's the fish from fish with knives, guys.

1676
01:50:32,020 --> 01:50:32,320
Oh, no.

1677
01:50:32,360 --> 01:50:33,240
How do I get out of here?

1678
01:50:34,540 --> 01:50:36,020
Does that mean I can get the flag now?

1679
01:50:41,940 --> 01:50:43,900
Should be allowed to claim the flag, right?

1680
01:50:45,340 --> 01:50:45,740
No?

1681
01:50:53,110 --> 01:50:55,130
I mean, I guess I'll just go back.

1682
01:50:57,470 --> 01:50:58,370
Because I can't...

1683
01:50:58,370 --> 01:50:58,550
Oh!

1684
01:50:59,490 --> 01:51:01,530
Is that someone over there?

1685
01:51:05,110 --> 01:51:05,990
Am I tripping?

1686
01:51:07,090 --> 01:51:07,370
Oh?

1687
01:51:08,230 --> 01:51:09,810
No, that's just the graphics, right?

1688
01:51:11,790 --> 01:51:13,730
Tower and structure are sunk to the floor.

1689
01:51:14,590 --> 01:51:16,550
The player realizes there's an interfering party.

1690
01:51:17,210 --> 01:51:20,230
Nevertheless, the player marches on towards the blue flag.

1691
01:51:20,810 --> 01:51:22,130
I'm already there.

1692
01:51:26,660 --> 01:51:27,400
What do you mean?

1693
01:51:27,460 --> 01:51:29,340
I already went over to the flag.

1694
01:51:33,440 --> 01:51:34,640
Anything over here?

1695
01:51:37,080 --> 01:51:37,840
Hello, fishies.

1696
01:51:38,500 --> 01:51:39,700
The player remembers music.

1697
01:51:40,420 --> 01:51:41,580
This isn't what they're expecting.

1698
01:51:42,340 --> 01:51:44,740
If I'm being honest, I'd like to have some music.

1699
01:51:45,160 --> 01:51:46,160
I didn't do this, of course.

1700
01:51:46,840 --> 01:51:48,640
There's three of us here now.

1701
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:51,480
Well, four are counting you.

1702
01:51:52,440 --> 01:51:54,260
At least we're up here.

1703
01:51:56,440 --> 01:52:00,060
Oh, hey, there's more fishes.

1704
01:52:01,140 --> 01:52:01,340
Oh.

1705
01:52:02,920 --> 01:52:05,240
A thick sheet of glass is separating the player and the
fish.

1706
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,420
Looking in their eyes, you sense a sense of relief.

1707
01:52:11,060 --> 01:52:11,400
Wee!

1708
01:52:14,060 --> 01:52:14,740
Alright, reset.

1709
01:52:18,460 --> 01:52:19,860
Does that mean I can get the flag now?

1710
01:52:24,500 --> 01:52:25,880
I should be allowed to get the flag.

1711
01:52:25,960 --> 01:52:27,100
I feel like I got all the dialogue.

1712
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:33,140
Hello?

1713
01:52:35,780 --> 01:52:37,840
Am I allowed to get the flag now?

1714
01:52:39,900 --> 01:52:40,940
Oh, wait.

1715
01:52:44,020 --> 01:52:45,500
Just like the classic.

1716
01:52:52,050 --> 01:52:53,330
Oh, it's still not possible.

1717
01:52:53,730 --> 01:52:54,310
That's weird.

1718
01:52:55,690 --> 01:52:57,190
I might get shoot the fish, though, at least.

1719
01:53:01,010 --> 01:53:03,210
What if I'm supposed to play it?

1720
01:53:04,610 --> 01:53:06,730
Just like in real life, I know.

1721
01:53:07,390 --> 01:53:10,370
Don't you hate it when your fish explodes after you shoot
it?

1722
01:53:14,250 --> 01:53:15,590
That's the worst, guys.

1723
01:53:19,210 --> 01:53:20,370
I think that's it.

1724
01:53:21,670 --> 01:53:23,010
That's all the stone did.

1725
01:53:24,850 --> 01:53:26,590
I don't think there's anywhere else to climb.

1726
01:53:28,530 --> 01:53:29,730
Okay, yeah, that was just a map.

1727
01:53:29,850 --> 01:53:31,150
It wasn't actually a ghost.

1728
01:53:32,010 --> 01:53:32,590
Thank God.

1729
01:53:34,430 --> 01:53:36,110
I mean, I could climb that, right?

1730
01:53:36,530 --> 01:53:37,250
Does this lead anywhere?

1731
01:53:37,270 --> 01:53:38,710
I don't think it leads anywhere, though.

1732
01:53:39,310 --> 01:53:39,990
I could try.

1733
01:53:49,090 --> 01:53:50,370
Yeah, I broke the game.

1734
01:53:52,210 --> 01:53:52,870
Wee!

1735
01:53:53,230 --> 01:53:53,350
Oh!

1736
01:53:56,410 --> 01:53:57,970
Yeah, I think that's it.

1737
01:54:00,630 --> 01:54:02,350
Alright, I'm leaving the game.

1738
01:54:03,210 --> 01:54:05,030
We gotta add another stone in here.

1739
01:54:13,010 --> 01:54:15,150
Okay, I guess I'm not leaving the game.

1740
01:54:16,030 --> 01:54:16,490
Yes!

1741
01:54:19,470 --> 01:54:19,800
Uh...

1742
01:54:22,290 --> 01:54:22,950
Uh...

1743
01:54:24,710 --> 01:54:25,370
Um...

1744
01:54:33,330 --> 01:54:34,490
Okay, so...

1745
01:54:34,490 --> 01:54:35,550
Oh, yeah, I saw the crate.

1746
01:54:35,950 --> 01:54:36,350
Yeah, yeah.

1747
01:54:36,930 --> 01:54:37,810
Gabe says no.

1748
01:54:40,870 --> 01:54:42,790
You can't leave, Doki.

1749
01:54:44,570 --> 01:54:46,130
Do I have to find Nina?

1750
01:54:46,930 --> 01:54:47,790
Nina to die?

1751
01:54:49,110 --> 01:54:51,110
There was a crate over there.

1752
01:54:56,730 --> 01:54:59,230
Yeah, I saw that, but I didn't think I could go through it.

1753
01:55:01,670 --> 01:55:02,830
Oh, what?

1754
01:55:04,910 --> 01:55:05,590
Oh, never mind.

1755
01:55:05,810 --> 01:55:06,610
That's awful out of bounds.

1756
01:55:06,810 --> 01:55:07,490
Never goodbye.

1757
01:55:11,940 --> 01:55:12,400
Goodbye?

1758
01:55:20,600 --> 01:55:21,240
Oh.

1759
01:55:26,570 --> 01:55:26,970
Hello?

1760
01:55:27,590 --> 01:55:27,910
Oh.

1761
01:55:30,790 --> 01:55:31,030
Oh.

1762
01:55:31,510 --> 01:55:31,670
Oh.

1763
01:55:32,450 --> 01:55:32,750
Oh.

1764
01:55:33,070 --> 01:55:33,330
Oh.

1765
01:55:33,670 --> 01:55:33,990
Oh.

1766
01:55:34,210 --> 01:55:34,730
Oh.

1767
01:55:34,850 --> 01:55:35,410
Oh.

1768
01:55:35,410 --> 01:55:35,470
Oh.

1769
01:55:36,510 --> 01:55:37,150
Wait.

1770
01:55:37,730 --> 01:55:38,370
Wait.

1771
01:55:39,350 --> 01:55:39,710
Wait.

1772
01:55:40,410 --> 01:55:40,890
That's...

1773
01:55:40,890 --> 01:55:41,090
Oh.

1774
01:55:41,310 --> 01:55:42,230
That's a flag.

1775
01:55:42,390 --> 01:55:43,110
Right there.

1776
01:55:43,290 --> 01:55:46,730
Guys, oh, oh, I don't like that.

1777
01:55:46,930 --> 01:55:47,990
I don't like that.

1778
01:55:48,250 --> 01:55:50,490
Oh, oh, I don't like that.

1779
01:55:50,830 --> 01:55:52,610
Oh, I think, guys, do you think he sees me?

1780
01:55:53,030 --> 01:55:54,490
No, right, guys, do you think he...

1781
01:55:54,490 --> 01:55:55,910
No, he doesn't see me, right?

1782
01:55:56,090 --> 01:55:56,850
He doesn't...

1783
01:55:56,850 --> 01:55:59,030
Oh, but there's a flag right there.

1784
01:56:01,330 --> 01:56:05,110
It's okay, I don't think I'll just slowly swim to the side.

1785
01:56:07,930 --> 01:56:09,970
Must capture fly.

1786
01:56:13,590 --> 01:56:32,960
I don't think he sees me right oh I'm very slowly going to
the side who's like literally capping the flag right now oh

Oh, oh, I made it.

1796
01:58:15,610 --> 01:58:18,090
The player stands in a room with a wooden door.

1797
01:58:18,790 --> 01:58:19,710
The clock ticking.

1798
01:58:20,550 --> 01:58:22,450
A carpet with a familiar smell.

1799
01:58:23,230 --> 01:58:24,870
Grassy lawn circled the concrete pillars.

1800
01:58:25,150 --> 01:58:27,550
Seem only a distant memory now.

1801
01:58:28,190 --> 01:58:28,850
Open the door?

1802
01:58:30,230 --> 01:58:30,530
No.

1803
01:58:35,240 --> 01:58:36,280
Oh, okay.

1804
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:48,140
Oh?

1805
01:58:50,140 --> 01:58:51,280
Where am I?

1806
01:58:54,100 --> 01:59:09,970
hello oh this game is buggy as fuck right now oh okay oh um
parkour

1807
01:59:14,790 --> 01:59:25,210
oh oh oh this game does not look like it's okay oh okay

1808
01:59:34,180 --> 01:59:35,180
Is this okay?

1809
01:59:35,380 --> 01:59:36,220
Is this game okay?

1810
01:59:38,720 --> 01:59:42,760
Oh, it feels like the coder stopped working on this game.

1811
01:59:44,220 --> 01:59:45,220
Yeah, where's my gun?

1812
01:59:45,440 --> 01:59:46,960
What happened to my gun?

1813
01:59:52,820 --> 01:59:54,160
Where the fuck do I go?

1814
01:59:55,200 --> 01:59:56,800
What if I just walk away?

1815
01:59:58,000 --> 01:59:59,420
Oh, I can't walk away.

1816
02:00:00,920 --> 02:00:01,580
Oh, man.

1817
02:00:02,100 --> 02:00:06,460
Don't you hate it when they update a new patch and it breaks
everything, guys?

1818
02:00:08,020 --> 02:00:09,420
That's the fucking worst.

1819
02:00:13,270 --> 02:00:14,470
I don't even know where to go.

1820
02:00:18,480 --> 02:00:18,760
Oh.

1821
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,060
Oh my god, this game is so fucky.

1822
02:00:25,860 --> 02:00:27,080
I'm so lost.

1823
02:00:32,940 --> 02:00:33,920
Oh my god, please.

1824
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:34,860
Please.

1825
02:00:35,100 --> 02:00:36,200
Where do I go?

1826
02:00:38,280 --> 02:00:40,020
We live here now.

1827
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:41,460
Can I leave?

1828
02:00:43,120 --> 02:00:43,940
Nope, nope.

1829
02:00:44,080 --> 02:00:44,880
It's okay.

1830
02:00:45,540 --> 02:00:46,100
It's okay.

1831
02:00:47,060 --> 02:00:49,300
Maybe I can just, you know, turn off my PC.

1832
02:00:54,010 --> 02:00:55,050
Do I just stand in this room?

1833
02:00:55,090 --> 02:00:56,550
Maybe I just stand in this room.

1834
02:00:59,810 --> 02:01:01,190
I don't like this.

1835
02:01:05,230 --> 02:01:07,070
Maybe something will start loading.

1836
02:01:08,890 --> 02:01:10,430
Oh, I don't like this.

1837
02:01:18,820 --> 02:01:20,860
Oh, do the rectangles need to line up?

1838
02:01:21,120 --> 02:01:22,040
Oh, there it is.

1839
02:01:22,860 --> 02:01:24,540
No, it's not finished yet, of course.

1840
02:01:24,620 --> 02:01:26,300
I see what you're saying.

1841
02:01:26,980 --> 02:01:27,760
It's not that I don't agree.

1842
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:29,480
It's just a process, you know?

1843
02:01:30,240 --> 02:01:30,600
Okay.

1844
02:01:36,100 --> 02:01:38,720
I don't like it when you comment about my work before it's
done.

1845
02:01:40,320 --> 02:01:41,960
How would you feel if I did that with yours?

1846
02:01:42,640 --> 02:01:43,000
Oh.

1847
02:01:43,660 --> 02:01:44,020
Okay.

1848
02:01:44,700 --> 02:01:46,200
Oh, now I have to line this up.

1849
02:01:48,480 --> 02:01:49,940
Oh, hey, there's a woman there.

1850
02:01:50,200 --> 02:01:50,900
I mean, there's a person.

1851
02:01:50,920 --> 02:01:53,000
Well, I don't know if it's a woman, but...

1852
02:01:56,520 --> 02:01:57,180
Line up.

1853
02:01:57,520 --> 02:01:58,100
There you go.

1854
02:01:59,100 --> 02:01:59,620
Oh, okay.

1855
02:01:59,740 --> 02:02:00,700
No, it's Okay, really.

1856
02:02:01,100 --> 02:02:01,460
Don't worry.

1857
02:02:01,540 --> 02:02:02,980
I have stuff I have to do downstairs.

1858
02:02:03,600 --> 02:02:04,440
You can have the room.

1859
02:02:05,720 --> 02:02:06,520
Don't assume.

1860
02:02:07,060 --> 02:02:09,080
I just don't want to talk about this right now.

1861
02:02:09,480 --> 02:02:11,280
Just stop helping me for the rest of the day.

1862
02:02:11,700 --> 02:02:11,700
Oh.

1863
02:02:12,720 --> 02:02:13,680
Are you guys okay?

1864
02:02:14,060 --> 02:02:15,340
I love you too, honey.

1865
02:02:15,680 --> 02:02:16,560
I'll see you later.

1866
02:02:18,160 --> 02:02:18,560
Oh.

1867
02:02:18,900 --> 02:02:19,220
Okay.

1868
02:02:19,680 --> 02:02:21,020
Guys, I fixed the game, guys.

1869
02:02:21,060 --> 02:02:21,280
Look.

1870
02:02:22,620 --> 02:02:24,060
Oh, oh, there's another room.

1871
02:02:24,260 --> 02:02:25,520
Oh, the room fixed itself.

1872
02:02:25,800 --> 02:02:25,960
Oh.

1873
02:02:27,960 --> 02:02:28,360
Oh.

1874
02:02:30,860 --> 02:02:32,060
Oh, okay.

1875
02:02:33,680 --> 02:02:34,820
Oh, there it is.

1876
02:02:37,460 --> 02:02:38,600
Oh, that's so trippy.

1877
02:02:44,730 --> 02:02:46,110
You really cut it like that.

1878
02:02:46,470 --> 02:02:46,630
It's weird.

1879
02:02:46,750 --> 02:02:47,610
I've never noticed.

1880
02:02:49,010 --> 02:02:49,030
Hmm.

1881
02:02:49,270 --> 02:02:51,390
Is it weird that sometimes you feel like a new person to me?

1882
02:02:52,850 --> 02:02:53,210
No.

1883
02:02:53,610 --> 02:02:54,910
Don't go look at me like that.

1884
02:02:55,510 --> 02:02:56,530
I met in a good way.

1885
02:02:57,410 --> 02:02:57,950
I'm sorry.

1886
02:03:00,210 --> 02:03:00,730
Are you sure?

1887
02:03:01,150 --> 02:03:03,010
I can run out and get some and it's fine.

1888
02:03:03,650 --> 02:03:04,050
Really?

1889
02:03:04,590 --> 02:03:05,550
Thank you so much.

1890
02:03:06,370 --> 02:03:08,170
I'll just, like, it's simmered down for now.

1891
02:03:08,390 --> 02:03:11,750
Oh, it's like memories from like whoever died.

1892
02:03:18,340 --> 02:03:19,320
Can we talk about tomorrow?

1893
02:03:19,700 --> 02:03:21,000
I have to get up early tomorrow.

1894
02:03:21,660 --> 02:03:21,900
Yeah.

1895
02:03:23,480 --> 02:03:25,200
I'm meeting with my agent again.

1896
02:03:26,380 --> 02:03:27,120
Oh, you know?

1897
02:03:27,500 --> 02:03:29,760
She wanted to go over Ditas with a retrospective.

1898
02:03:36,070 --> 02:03:38,710
I added some cold water so you can drink it right away.

1899
02:03:39,570 --> 02:03:40,050
Don't worry.

1900
02:03:40,290 --> 02:03:41,910
It's not from the tap, I promise.

1901
02:03:43,170 --> 02:03:44,650
Oh, okay.

1902
02:03:46,690 --> 02:03:48,050
Oh, this is a new room.

1903
02:03:56,370 --> 02:03:57,630
I don't want to be alone right now.

1904
02:03:58,070 --> 02:03:59,350
Why don't you understand that?

1905
02:04:00,470 --> 02:04:01,770
I know you need that.

1906
02:04:02,030 --> 02:04:03,770
It's just, I don't need that right now.

1907
02:04:05,510 --> 02:04:06,430
I'm just saying that.

1908
02:04:06,570 --> 02:04:07,910
I want you to be able to do your thing.

1909
02:04:08,430 --> 02:04:11,050
I don't worry about you spending so much time taking care of
me.

1910
02:04:11,730 --> 02:04:15,290
It's just, I don't want you to be responsive to you giving
everything up.

1911
02:04:15,570 --> 02:04:18,070
Oh, they're dying.

Upstairs is fixed now.

1922
02:05:03,470 --> 02:05:04,610
You're keeping me downstairs?

1923
02:05:05,030 --> 02:05:05,710
What's the point?

1924
02:05:06,250 --> 02:05:07,830
You didn't even make the second floor.

1925
02:05:08,150 --> 02:05:09,610
You don't need to be so transparent.

1926
02:05:10,130 --> 02:05:12,090
Why are you always talking about me?

1927
02:05:12,490 --> 02:05:15,310
What's going- why are we still not talking with- Where have
you found me?

1928
02:05:15,370 --> 02:05:17,490
What are you- why are you keeping me in your work?

1929
02:05:17,730 --> 02:05:18,470
What is this place?

1930
02:05:18,630 --> 02:05:22,410
What- Okay, okay, okay.

1931
02:05:22,910 --> 02:05:25,790
To you, is anything I'm saying getting through?

1932
02:05:35,170 --> 02:05:37,330
Oh, this is where I walked Nina.

1933
02:05:39,450 --> 02:05:40,470
I remember this.

1934
02:05:41,810 --> 02:05:43,390
This is a doggy soul.

1935
02:05:47,420 --> 02:05:47,880
Hello?

1936
02:05:48,500 --> 02:05:50,280
Ooh, this is getting trippy.

1937
02:05:51,640 --> 02:05:52,020
Hello?

1938
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,280
Rocking a ghost is so fun, guys.

1939
02:05:57,420 --> 02:05:58,700
No trauma here at all.

1940
02:06:00,140 --> 02:06:01,720
Oh my god.

1941
02:06:03,640 --> 02:06:04,660
Where am I going?

1942
02:06:05,840 --> 02:06:07,820
It's procedural generated too.

1943
02:06:08,100 --> 02:06:09,280
This game has everything.

1944
02:06:11,940 --> 02:06:14,660
Why is the music getting spookier?

1945
02:06:14,780 --> 02:06:16,060
The more I walk.

1946
02:06:17,200 --> 02:06:17,540
Oh.

1947
02:06:18,400 --> 02:06:19,240
I did it.

1948
02:06:19,280 --> 02:06:21,420
I procedural generated a link.

1949
02:06:24,620 --> 02:06:25,500
It's like jump.

1950
02:06:26,760 --> 02:06:28,000
I don't want to jump.

1951
02:06:30,500 --> 02:06:33,480
You're like, Doki, you're supposed to jump now, okay?

1952
02:06:35,400 --> 02:06:35,740
Oh?

1953
02:06:43,660 --> 02:06:45,780
Listen to the music, Doki.

1954
02:06:46,640 --> 02:06:48,320
Jump into the red lake!

1955
02:06:49,880 --> 02:06:51,620
Oh, hey, we're back in the game.

1956
02:06:52,580 --> 02:06:53,680
We did it!

1957
02:06:56,780 --> 02:07:00,640
The game is just...

1958
02:07:03,380 --> 02:07:04,460
A window...

1959
02:07:08,440 --> 02:07:10,120
Look within.

1960
02:07:14,680 --> 02:07:16,200
Find me.

1961
02:07:22,260 --> 02:07:22,920
Oh.

1962
02:07:24,080 --> 02:07:24,860
Okay.

1963
02:07:26,380 --> 02:07:26,760
Alright.

1964
02:07:27,060 --> 02:07:28,980
Now the game has a sword.

1965
02:07:29,300 --> 02:07:30,240
Has a dog.

1966
02:07:30,360 --> 02:07:30,600
Oh.

1967
02:07:31,120 --> 02:07:31,560
Is that?

1968
02:07:33,080 --> 02:07:33,560
Oh.

1969
02:07:37,040 --> 02:07:37,880
Oh.

1970
02:07:40,360 --> 02:07:41,580
Thanks, Sarah.

1971
02:07:42,460 --> 02:07:44,940
Guys, these malware is getting crazy now, guys.

1972
02:07:45,940 --> 02:07:46,840
Oh, my God.

1973
02:07:47,480 --> 02:07:48,580
You know, oh.

1974
02:07:50,220 --> 02:07:51,460
Sarah's studio.

1975
02:07:57,050 --> 02:08:00,330
Oh, I didn't think I was actually drying.

1976
02:08:18,160 --> 02:08:19,120
Did I do good?

1977
02:08:23,660 --> 02:08:24,340
Yeah!

1978
02:08:26,080 --> 02:08:30,640
Hey, I did real good.

1979
02:08:32,960 --> 02:08:33,620
Clear.

1980
02:08:37,280 --> 02:08:38,300
Oh yeah, it had 10!

1981
02:08:39,620 --> 02:08:40,840
Oh, do I have to let...

1982
02:08:44,510 --> 02:08:45,630
I don't have what?

1983
02:08:45,690 --> 02:08:46,310
Oh, this is what.

1984
02:08:50,010 --> 02:08:53,180
And then...

1985
02:08:53,180 --> 02:08:54,080
And then...

1986
02:08:58,860 --> 02:08:59,860
Where's my signature?

1987
02:09:02,320 --> 02:09:02,680
There.

1988
02:09:02,980 --> 02:09:04,940
You're smelling the nose of flower.

1989
02:09:05,800 --> 02:09:06,100
Yay!

1990
02:09:07,700 --> 02:09:08,360
Man.

1991
02:09:08,960 --> 02:09:09,620
Sarah.

1992
02:09:11,800 --> 02:09:13,120
Did I do it?

1993
02:09:17,550 --> 02:09:19,730
What a fun little game.

1994
02:09:22,390 --> 02:09:22,410
Yay!

1995
02:09:23,450 --> 02:09:25,090
Can I only get 8 out of 10?

1996
02:09:27,490 --> 02:09:28,750
What a masterpiece.

1997
02:09:30,430 --> 02:09:31,650
Yeah, mood.

1998
02:09:39,630 --> 02:09:40,110
Oh, you don't worry.

1999
02:09:40,190 --> 02:09:41,130
There's flowers here.

2000
02:09:45,860 --> 02:09:46,440
There we go.

2001
02:09:50,140 --> 02:09:51,680
Does that give me 8 out of 10 as well?

2002
02:09:52,560 --> 02:09:54,860
It's just going to give 8 out of 10 all the time.

2003
02:09:59,940 --> 02:10:00,340
Yeah.

2004
02:10:03,060 --> 02:10:04,640
There's no other score.

2005
02:10:04,860 --> 02:10:07,800
This guy only programmed this game to give me 8 out of 10.

2006
02:10:08,980 --> 02:10:09,380
Alright.

2007
02:10:12,040 --> 02:10:13,500
Do I infuse it with this?

2008
02:10:14,480 --> 02:10:14,920
Generate.

2009
02:10:15,840 --> 02:10:17,500
Wait, I got to generate a new host.

2010
02:10:18,800 --> 02:10:19,620
Give me a sec.

2011
02:10:21,300 --> 02:10:24,580
My Satan Dark Arts app needs to have a new host.

2012
02:10:24,600 --> 02:10:25,220
for this.

2013
02:10:26,160 --> 02:10:27,100
I assume that.

2014
02:10:28,520 --> 02:10:30,240
Maybe Mind Sweeper?

2015
02:10:30,660 --> 02:10:32,760
Oh my god, what the fuck is in?

2016
02:10:34,500 --> 02:10:37,380
Sarah used to love Mind Sweeper.

2017
02:10:38,380 --> 02:10:38,380
Alright.

2018
02:10:39,300 --> 02:10:39,980
Mind?

2019
02:10:40,440 --> 02:10:41,600
What the fuck?

2020
02:10:42,260 --> 02:10:42,260
Okay.

2021
02:11:00,400 --> 02:11:01,600
Mind friend.

2022
02:11:02,620 --> 02:11:03,980
Friend shape.

2023
02:11:06,060 --> 02:11:06,880
What happens?

2024
02:11:07,020 --> 02:11:07,740
Does he die?

2025
02:11:12,500 --> 02:11:29,600
we don't do good like does he like die yeah that's the game
yeah okay apparently if you infuse these two games together

2026
02:11:29,600 --> 02:11:42,100
it just becomes a funny silly game all right no it becomes a
little silly okay dungeon blade what the what kind of game

2027
02:11:42,100 --> 02:11:43,160
will this mate.

2028
02:11:44,220 --> 02:11:45,400
Yeah, for the dragoons.

2029
02:11:45,800 --> 02:11:47,520
Yeah, thank you, Super Chat Labby.

2030
02:11:47,740 --> 02:11:48,320
Thank you, thank you.

2031
02:11:48,820 --> 02:11:58,220
When you're faced with a blank canvas, you paint waves
before you paint the storm.

2032
02:12:01,160 --> 02:12:01,520
Okay.

2033
02:12:03,360 --> 02:12:04,160
Okay.

2034
02:12:11,230 --> 02:12:11,710
Oh.

2035
02:12:13,250 --> 02:12:13,870
Huh.

2036
02:12:15,170 --> 02:12:15,970
Alright.

2037
02:12:16,270 --> 02:12:16,690
Alright.

2038
02:12:16,690 --> 02:12:18,710
I have the Power of brush on me.

2039
02:12:22,950 --> 02:12:23,330
Paint!

2040
02:12:23,790 --> 02:12:23,790
Paint!

2041
02:12:24,370 --> 02:12:24,370
Paint!

2042
02:12:24,790 --> 02:12:24,790
Paint!

2043
02:12:25,910 --> 02:12:26,690
Bam!

2044
02:12:27,830 --> 02:12:28,790
Painted.

2045
02:12:32,090 --> 02:12:33,410
Get painted.

2046
02:12:33,790 --> 02:12:33,870
Oh.

2047
02:12:35,010 --> 02:12:36,170
Friends and family.

2048
02:12:36,430 --> 02:12:36,610
Okay.

2049
02:12:38,450 --> 02:12:38,970
Alright.

2050
02:12:40,710 --> 02:12:42,250
Very abstract, Sarah.

2051
02:12:44,090 --> 02:12:44,850
Is there another one?

2052
02:12:45,770 --> 02:12:47,150
What a masterpiece.

2053
02:12:47,990 --> 02:12:48,650
It's just easy.

2054
02:12:48,670 --> 02:13:04,660
that painting is so easy guys should be forgot slap your
brush onto a canvas and BAM two million dollars laundering

2055
02:13:04,660 --> 02:13:21,160
scheme for those who don't know a lot of art gallery shit is
just a fucking money launder distant places I'm Picasso yeah

2056
02:13:24,400 --> 02:13:26,820
Like, you'd be like, how the fuck did this sewed for $2
million?

2057
02:13:27,220 --> 02:13:29,320
But it's just peeped billionaires trying to money
laundering.

2058
02:13:30,140 --> 02:13:30,600
Wait, what?

2059
02:13:30,680 --> 02:13:31,420
Why can't peep this?

2060
02:13:31,580 --> 02:13:32,140
Oh, there it is.

2061
02:13:38,850 --> 02:13:40,090
Feels like home.

2062
02:13:40,490 --> 02:13:42,870
I feel like Sarah might not be a very good artist.

2063
02:13:48,550 --> 02:13:49,870
Alright, here you go.

2064
02:13:56,890 --> 02:13:57,930
Now what is this?

2065
02:13:58,930 --> 02:14:00,610
Brings me to Sarah.

2066
02:14:01,990 --> 02:14:02,750
Brings me to what?

2067
02:14:04,390 --> 02:14:05,790
Oh, one more painting.

2068
02:14:10,800 --> 02:14:14,100
I'll just say I definitely would not have bought any of
these paintings.

2069
02:14:14,340 --> 02:14:14,980
I'm sorry, Sarah.

2070
02:14:17,440 --> 02:14:18,980
I just, I don't know.

2071
02:14:19,100 --> 02:14:20,340
There's something about that.

2072
02:14:20,460 --> 02:14:22,200
It's just untitled.

2073
02:14:22,620 --> 02:14:23,100
Oh, okay.

2074
02:14:23,120 --> 02:14:25,020
Now you can't even name your painting, Sarah.

2075
02:14:25,540 --> 02:14:26,500
What can you do?

2076
02:14:31,160 --> 02:14:31,500
Oh.

2077
02:14:32,520 --> 02:14:33,940
Is this lost?

2078
02:14:34,360 --> 02:14:35,580
Yeah, I'll take you with a super chat.

2079
02:14:35,680 --> 02:14:35,980
Thank you.

2080
02:14:38,340 --> 02:14:39,300
All right.

2081
02:14:42,040 --> 02:14:42,200
Oh.

2082
02:14:43,780 --> 02:14:44,320
Oh.

2083
02:14:45,560 --> 02:14:46,260
Oh.

2084
02:14:46,720 --> 02:14:47,080
Oh.

2085
02:14:47,260 --> 02:14:47,940
New stone.

2086
02:14:49,400 --> 02:14:50,060
All right.

2087
02:14:51,640 --> 02:14:53,020
Infuse time.

2088
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:55,520
Okay.

2089
02:14:56,840 --> 02:14:57,280
Oh.

2090
02:14:58,300 --> 02:14:59,040
Oh.

2091
02:14:59,640 --> 02:15:02,760
That was a very scary painting there, Sarah.

2092
02:15:02,980 --> 02:15:03,820
Oh, that wall.

2093
02:15:04,120 --> 02:15:06,400
Now my game is just red.

2094
02:15:06,740 --> 02:15:07,680
Like the devil.

2095
02:15:07,920 --> 02:15:08,260
Okay.

2096
02:15:08,320 --> 02:15:12,400
I think we fit a lot of souls into this game I don't guys.

2097
02:15:12,500 --> 02:15:20,280
I'm a little worried because it feels like this game now
might have an over a button to souls now I don't know how

2098
02:15:20,280 --> 02:15:35,120
many souls we put it in there Could the infinity souls are
now complete Oh I have a barrel now

2099
02:15:39,460 --> 02:15:42,860
Oh wait, it came back Wait, what?

2100
02:15:46,860 --> 02:15:47,900
Oh, that's cool.

2101
02:15:55,660 --> 02:15:56,600
Now there's barrels.

2102
02:15:56,840 --> 02:15:57,680
Do I have to do this again?

2103
02:15:59,340 --> 02:16:00,100
Oh, I do.

2104
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,120
You have to put two and two together faster than people.

2105
02:16:04,580 --> 02:16:06,060
They know they're not safe much longer.

2106
02:16:06,520 --> 02:16:07,520
What does that player know?

2107
02:16:07,720 --> 02:16:08,780
Wait, what do you mean?

2108
02:16:09,400 --> 02:16:11,040
Does the player know that?

2109
02:16:14,440 --> 02:16:15,920
Oh, this is new data.

2110
02:16:17,140 --> 02:16:19,340
Oh, did you see that?

2111
02:16:19,780 --> 02:16:20,500
I think you cracked that.

2112
02:16:20,520 --> 02:16:21,020
glass.

2113
02:16:21,500 --> 02:16:22,620
I don't like this idea.

2114
02:16:23,360 --> 02:16:25,480
I'm sure the other one will get kick out of it.

2115
02:16:25,740 --> 02:16:26,620
Alright, let's do it again.

2116
02:16:33,140 --> 02:16:34,360
Oh, I can't do it.

2117
02:16:34,380 --> 02:16:34,880
I can't.

2118
02:16:34,960 --> 02:16:36,580
My bullets don't break the glass.

2119
02:16:40,280 --> 02:16:40,720
What?

2120
02:16:42,620 --> 02:16:43,600
Oh, hey.

2121
02:16:43,940 --> 02:16:45,580
Watch where you throw those things.

2122
02:16:45,940 --> 02:16:47,820
Things are already messy as they are.

2123
02:16:48,200 --> 02:16:50,020
Although maybe the barrels can help us out here.

2124
02:16:51,020 --> 02:16:52,360
Wait, what can the barrels do?

2125
02:16:58,760 --> 02:17:00,960
Okay, I can move the barrels somewhere.

2126
02:17:02,300 --> 02:17:02,800
But where?

2127
02:17:04,700 --> 02:17:06,080
Okay, it's a little puzzle.

2128
02:17:07,240 --> 02:17:09,220
Oh, I can move them.

2129
02:17:11,100 --> 02:17:12,180
Can I move it up here?

2130
02:17:16,700 --> 02:17:17,200
Okay.

2131
02:17:21,500 --> 02:17:23,340
Where am I supposed to move the barrels?

2132
02:17:29,500 --> 02:17:30,760
So I'm moving this way?

2133
02:17:31,700 --> 02:17:32,300
No?

2134
02:17:35,020 --> 02:17:37,020
Oh, the flag is back there.

2135
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:40,740
Oh, they patched the little area.

2136
02:17:46,270 --> 02:17:47,370
Yeah, they patched it.

2137
02:17:47,890 --> 02:17:52,990
Well, the barrel didn't respawn with the fishes this time.

2138
02:18:00,050 --> 02:18:02,630
Can I put the barrel into the...

2139
02:18:02,630 --> 02:18:03,870
Oh, no?

2140
02:18:07,110 --> 02:18:07,710
Hmm...

2141
02:18:08,110 --> 02:18:08,810
Another puzzle.

2142
02:18:10,730 --> 02:18:12,550
I'm like, where do I put these barrels?

2143
02:18:14,490 --> 02:18:15,950
Because they didn't respawn.

2144
02:18:23,800 --> 02:18:24,760
Oh, here?

2145
02:18:28,840 --> 02:18:29,320
No?

2146
02:18:30,320 --> 02:18:31,520
This is new.

2147
02:18:33,540 --> 02:18:35,440
Every time they come back, something is different.

2148
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:37,980
You've added even more of us to this game.

2149
02:18:38,500 --> 02:18:39,480
The new one seems nice.

2150
02:18:39,680 --> 02:18:40,620
One wanted more action.

2151
02:18:41,200 --> 02:18:52,280
these barrels the other well the other one wants you to find
them okay who's them who the fuck is them oh maybe this no

2152
02:18:52,280 --> 02:19:00,500
that doesn't take it yeah souls are talking to each other
right now the souls are trying to hot fix this game oh there

2153
02:19:00,500 --> 02:19:00,930

2154
02:19:10,360 --> 02:19:16,560
how the do we break the last one though Like this?

2155
02:19:20,440 --> 02:19:21,500
Oh, I want...

2156
02:19:21,500 --> 02:19:22,160
I need to figure out...

2157
02:19:22,160 --> 02:19:22,860
Oh, wait, maybe?

2158
02:19:25,740 --> 02:19:26,220
Yeah!

2159
02:19:26,820 --> 02:19:27,800
We did it!

2160
02:19:29,020 --> 02:19:29,500
Yeah!

2161
02:19:32,500 --> 02:19:34,140
We broke the aquarium!

2162
02:19:36,160 --> 02:19:37,220
Oh, now we can...

2163
02:19:37,220 --> 02:19:37,600
Oh, nice.

2164
02:19:37,680 --> 02:19:39,160
Now we can go to the other area.

2165
02:19:41,360 --> 02:19:41,600
Oh.

2166
02:19:43,360 --> 02:19:44,620
OTF gallery.

2167
02:19:45,160 --> 02:19:45,160
Oh.

2168
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:48,680
Okay.

2169
02:19:49,680 --> 02:19:50,840
Where am I going at?

2170
02:19:52,080 --> 02:19:53,300
New map, guys.

2171
02:19:53,640 --> 02:19:56,200
The souls created a new map for us.

2172
02:19:56,280 --> 02:19:57,300
How nice of them.

2173
02:20:00,340 --> 02:20:00,800
It's cool.

2174
02:20:00,880 --> 02:20:02,160
They programmed a new map.

2175
02:20:04,740 --> 02:20:06,820
Linger on the fruits of home.

2176
02:20:08,560 --> 02:20:08,800
Oh.

2177
02:20:09,080 --> 02:20:10,180
There's her painting.

2178
02:20:12,660 --> 02:20:13,340
Oh.

2179
02:20:13,360 --> 02:20:15,660
Oh, that's a video.

2180
02:20:19,750 --> 02:20:20,150
Oh, I guess.

2181
02:20:20,250 --> 02:20:22,270
Oh, that's the lake with the dog.

2182
02:20:22,970 --> 02:20:23,590
Oh, my God.

2183
02:20:23,750 --> 02:20:25,070
Did the dog drown?

2184
02:20:28,290 --> 02:20:29,550
That's the lake.

2185
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:38,680
Yeah, those are the paintings I did.

2186
02:20:44,030 --> 02:20:44,270
Oh.

2187
02:20:44,530 --> 02:20:45,090
Oh, hey.

2188
02:20:45,570 --> 02:20:46,210
Hey, Sarah.

2189
02:20:50,980 --> 02:20:52,080
What do you see?

2190
02:20:54,860 --> 02:20:56,400
In the painting, I mean.

2191
02:20:58,880 --> 02:21:07,940
I'm don't do very well with abstract art I'm not sure I kind
of see a woman with short black hair She's walking away from

2192
02:21:07,940 --> 02:21:17,020
the viewer You'd only see the back of her head here in the
middle What the fuck Oh I totally see it too And the yellow

2193
02:21:17,020 --> 02:21:25,180
around her like Street lights What the fuck Now I totally
won't be able to unsee that I actually kind of like these

2194
02:21:25,180 --> 02:21:32,660
abstract paintings reason every time i see this painting
i'll think of a woman walking down a street at night i mean

2195
02:21:32,660 --> 02:21:40,700
i i guess i i can see it i i also see a penguin in the
center like with his long ass beak

2196
02:21:46,500 --> 02:21:52,340
and and that way it kind of becomes something personal
someone else might see a kangaroo and that would be what a

2197
02:21:52,340 --> 02:21:57,200
painting is for them you really sound like you know what
you're talking about.

2198
02:21:58,080 --> 02:21:59,240
Oh, believe me, I don't.

2199
02:21:59,620 --> 02:22:01,960
I don't really go to places like this as much as I should.

2200
02:22:04,360 --> 02:22:05,280
You live in a city?

2201
02:22:06,040 --> 02:22:06,300
No.

2202
02:22:06,800 --> 02:22:12,040
I live way out in rain doing research at the Voskir in...
Yeah, whatever.

2203
02:22:12,260 --> 02:22:17,540
I come here once every month for meetings, and I try to
sneak in some sightseeing.

2204
02:22:25,480 --> 02:22:28,080
I live in Lichtenberg, so not that far from here.

2205
02:22:29,020 --> 02:22:31,100
By the way, I didn't catch your name.

2206
02:22:31,820 --> 02:22:32,540
I'm John.

2207
02:22:32,960 --> 02:22:37,100
Oh, this is when I first met my dead wife.

2208
02:22:38,700 --> 02:22:40,420
Sarah, it's nice to meet you, John.

2209
02:22:41,480 --> 02:22:42,280
Yeah, the same.

2210
02:22:46,240 --> 02:22:48,720
So, Sarah, what do you see in the painting?

2211
02:22:50,260 --> 02:22:51,540
Well, I don't know.

2212
02:22:51,800 --> 02:22:52,700
I don't think I should say.

2213
02:22:53,520 --> 02:22:57,160
John, you should tell her how you're programming your
goddamn video games.

2214
02:22:57,680 --> 02:22:58,680
Let me ask you something.

2215
02:22:59,440 --> 02:23:01,560
You think whatever the artist intended is important?

2216
02:23:03,760 --> 02:23:12,220
she's testing him because she knows she's the artist still
oh i hate that don't be like i wonder who did this painting

2217
02:23:12,220 --> 02:23:25,540
as you are the artist looking undercover maybe what do you
think i think the intent is not important you put a bigger

2218
02:23:25,540 --> 02:23:33,520
soul in there unintentionally and i believe that the viewer
probably sees that or feels that wait i just realized are

2219
02:23:33,520 --> 02:23:35,760
you the Yes, I am.

2220
02:23:36,320 --> 02:23:38,320
Oh, well, in that case, I have to know.

2221
02:23:38,840 --> 02:23:43,020
What do you see in the painting?

2222
02:23:45,180 --> 02:23:49,540
Well, if you must know, it's mostly crashing the...

2223
02:23:54,160 --> 02:23:56,060
Okay, that got me.

2224
02:23:56,900 --> 02:23:57,260
Okay.

2225
02:23:57,940 --> 02:23:59,240
Oh, my God.

2226
02:24:00,120 --> 02:24:00,500
Okay.

2227
02:24:01,120 --> 02:24:01,760
That...

2228
02:24:01,760 --> 02:24:02,580
Oh, my...

2229
02:24:02,580 --> 02:24:03,780
That actually got me.

2230
02:24:04,220 --> 02:24:05,560
Oh, my God.

2231
02:24:08,440 --> 02:24:09,660
Guys, I...

2232
02:24:09,660 --> 02:24:12,000
Yeah, I ran out of memory, guys.

2233
02:24:12,120 --> 02:24:14,240
There was just too much water in that scene.

2234
02:24:14,560 --> 02:24:16,640
My two megabytes couldn't handle it.

2235
02:24:17,960 --> 02:24:18,160
Okay.

2236
02:24:19,120 --> 02:24:22,080
But, that's been today since I'm out of my cascaded.

2237
02:24:22,780 --> 02:24:26,000
Oh, I had too much mesh levels, apparently.

2238
02:24:27,460 --> 02:24:27,840
Alright.

2239
02:24:34,570 --> 02:24:36,130
Oh, I can't delete it.

2240
02:24:36,350 --> 02:24:36,890
Okay.

2241
02:24:40,010 --> 02:24:40,650
Oh.

2242
02:24:41,010 --> 02:24:43,870
Delete, delete, delete, guys, I'm programming.

2243
02:24:45,590 --> 02:24:48,530
Oh, yeah, I know that's, yeah, my two megabytes was not
dealing with this.

2244
02:24:49,690 --> 02:24:51,710
We gotta delete the entire gallery, guys.

2245
02:24:54,890 --> 02:24:58,030
The entire, oh my god, there is no way.

2246
02:25:03,900 --> 02:25:05,800
Really, the entire gallery?

2247
02:25:18,410 --> 02:25:22,490
Bro, okay, yeah, yo, so, so we have two megabytes.

2248
02:25:22,670 --> 02:25:25,110
Nobody's running this on their fucking dial-up PC.

2249
02:25:31,740 --> 02:25:34,340
You have to fucking, what's the word?

2250
02:25:36,340 --> 02:25:38,300
What's the word to lower the size?

2251
02:25:39,800 --> 02:25:41,560
You gotta optimize that shit, bro.

2252
02:25:43,420 --> 02:25:47,040
Like, what's the point of combining all these solos into my
game?

2253
02:25:47,460 --> 02:25:49,640
If you can't even optimize shit.

2254
02:25:59,960 --> 02:26:01,400
Okay, we're almost done.

2255
02:26:05,320 --> 02:26:07,160
Is there still a stupid meme?

2256
02:26:08,080 --> 02:26:09,380
We can't delete that.

2257
02:26:10,500 --> 02:26:11,620
We'll just leave it here.

2258
02:26:15,700 --> 02:26:15,940
Compress.

2259
02:26:16,340 --> 02:26:16,520
Compress.

2260
02:26:17,020 --> 02:26:17,220
Compress.

2261
02:26:22,020 --> 02:26:24,220
Just keep compressing, guys.

2262
02:26:27,560 --> 02:26:28,000
Oh my god.

2263
02:26:28,080 --> 02:26:29,800
Am I deleting my entire map?

2264
02:26:31,020 --> 02:26:32,340
Okay, we gotta delete the...

2265
02:26:34,380 --> 02:26:35,340
The barrels.

2266
02:26:36,820 --> 02:26:38,080
That gets the fish, too.

2267
02:26:42,720 --> 02:26:44,220
Yeah, fuck the map as well.

2268
02:26:45,260 --> 02:26:48,300
You know, just... I don't even know if I'm deleting
everything correctly.

2269
02:26:48,660 --> 02:26:49,600
Okay, delete the barrels.

2270
02:26:50,020 --> 02:26:50,620
You know what, fuck it.

2271
02:26:50,740 --> 02:26:51,560
Delete the water.

2272
02:26:55,220 --> 02:26:56,680
Yeah, fuck this tree, too.

2273
02:26:57,120 --> 02:26:58,460
Yeah, fuck that area.

2274
02:26:59,880 --> 02:27:01,800
Because I don't think I'm doing this correctly.

2275
02:27:02,660 --> 02:27:02,920
You know what?

2276
02:27:02,920 --> 02:27:04,660
We don't need the glass here.

2277
02:27:07,480 --> 02:27:08,140
Oh, what?

2278
02:27:08,220 --> 02:27:08,860
Oh, that's me.

2279
02:27:09,080 --> 02:27:10,000
I'm gonna delete myself.

2280
02:27:11,760 --> 02:27:12,080
Look at that.

2281
02:27:12,100 --> 02:27:14,240
I'm freeing up so much memory now.

2282
02:27:16,340 --> 02:27:18,480
At memory, I'm saving, guys.

2283
02:27:22,560 --> 02:27:23,580
There's a gate?

2284
02:27:28,970 --> 02:27:29,250
Oh.

2285
02:27:29,910 --> 02:27:31,170
But I'm lost.

2286
02:27:47,020 --> 02:27:47,820
Uh.

2287
02:27:48,760 --> 02:27:50,020
Where am I?

2288
02:27:55,200 --> 02:27:55,800
Uh.

2289
02:28:01,900 --> 02:28:02,700
Compile.

2290
02:28:03,540 --> 02:28:05,340
I think I've saved, fixed the game.

2291
02:28:11,500 --> 02:28:12,520
And I do it?

2292
02:28:18,690 --> 02:28:20,090
Into the void, I go.

2293
02:28:20,370 --> 02:28:20,630
Yay!

2294
02:28:20,970 --> 02:28:21,730
Explore it.

2295
02:28:22,050 --> 02:28:22,210
Oh.

2296
02:28:35,770 --> 02:28:36,330
Sarah?

2297
02:28:39,030 --> 02:28:40,970
What did I do to my game?

2298
02:28:41,690 --> 02:28:42,590
Because I think I...

2299
02:28:42,590 --> 02:28:42,670
Oh.

2300
02:28:43,310 --> 02:28:44,690
Did I delete it too much?

2301
02:28:47,980 --> 02:28:48,820
Pick up.

2302
02:28:51,380 --> 02:28:51,940
Yes.

2303
02:29:07,780 --> 02:29:08,340
Ooh.

2304
02:29:11,630 --> 02:29:13,650
Ooh, it's getting a little freaky.

2305
02:29:19,090 --> 02:29:19,650
Whamamam.

2306
02:29:22,730 --> 02:29:24,430
What is this?

2307
02:29:24,730 --> 02:29:25,010
Muff?

2308
02:29:30,390 --> 02:29:31,250
What am I doing?

2309
02:29:34,470 --> 02:29:35,650
Oh, it's Morse code.

2310
02:29:36,590 --> 02:29:38,310
Oh my god, I'm DJing right now.

2311
02:29:51,070 --> 02:29:52,230
I'm DJing?

2312
02:29:54,830 --> 02:29:56,150
Did I do it?

2313
02:29:58,370 --> 02:29:59,810
Did I do it correctly?

2314
02:30:00,610 --> 02:30:02,310
Is that how DJs are born?

2315
02:30:05,090 --> 02:30:06,090
I don't know.

2316
02:30:06,110 --> 02:30:06,510
No.

2317
02:30:07,090 --> 02:30:08,010
Morse code.

2318
02:30:17,140 --> 02:30:19,420
I don't even know what I'm supposed to do.

2319
02:30:37,270 --> 02:30:38,810
Calibrate, reverse speed.

2320
02:30:38,990 --> 02:30:39,390
Oh, shit.

2321
02:30:39,710 --> 02:30:39,710
Sorry.

2322
02:30:40,290 --> 02:30:42,450
Reverse speed 50.

2323
02:30:44,830 --> 02:30:48,070
Yeah, I was too busy jamming out to the thing.

2324
02:30:48,590 --> 02:30:49,190
All right, there you go.

2325
02:30:50,970 --> 02:30:51,690
I did it.

2326
02:30:51,970 --> 02:30:53,630
I like there's a text that tells me what to do.

2327
02:30:53,750 --> 02:30:54,090
And I'm like,

2328
02:31:02,960 --> 02:31:04,400
My voice

2329
02:31:07,960 --> 02:31:13,640
It's so clear I can hear myself again I was in the groove, I
was DJing

2330
02:31:16,940 --> 02:31:24,700
Putting on these records It's acting as sort of a channel I
don't think we have much time

2331
02:31:30,260 --> 02:31:31,340
I'm Sarah.

2332
02:31:33,660 --> 02:31:34,340
Or...

2333
02:31:34,340 --> 02:31:35,560
What's left of me?

2334
02:31:37,520 --> 02:31:39,060
This record player.

2335
02:31:44,290 --> 02:31:44,810
John.

2336
02:31:47,170 --> 02:31:48,330
Wait, John did this.

2337
02:31:49,150 --> 02:31:51,350
He put my soul in here.

2338
02:31:51,930 --> 02:31:52,230
Yeah.

2339
02:31:54,310 --> 02:31:58,270
Okay, maybe you should have married a fucking satanic
worshiper.

2340
02:31:58,950 --> 02:31:59,930
Maybe that's you, Sarah.

2341
02:32:00,510 --> 02:32:01,310
That's on you.

2342
02:32:02,050 --> 02:32:03,330
By tearing me loose from...

2343
02:32:03,350 --> 02:32:28,860
the game you somehow cleared up all the noise like popping
your ears I don't remember much I was walking I don't feel

2344
02:32:28,860 --> 02:32:35,540
like there'd be signs you know if you're married to a
fucking Satan worshiper that's like transmutating mutating

2345
02:32:35,540 --> 02:32:48,780
souls into a video game there has to be signs i woke up i
could see again everything was clear but i had no body

2346
02:32:52,760 --> 02:33:05,860

record is running out.

2347
02:33:06,080 --> 02:33:08,280
Okay, it didn't help that I was jamming out with the record.

2348
02:33:08,520 --> 02:33:09,960
I'll create a new one.

2349
02:33:12,680 --> 02:33:13,700
Oh, hey, a new record.

2350
02:33:15,400 --> 02:33:17,660
We can keep talking on there.

2351
02:33:22,500 --> 02:33:22,780
Oh.

2352
02:33:23,360 --> 02:33:23,920
Nice.

2353
02:33:24,520 --> 02:33:25,440
That's cool.

2354
02:33:26,900 --> 02:33:27,340
Okay.

2355
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:29,300
I can do to talk to you.

2356
02:33:32,800 --> 02:33:33,360
Okay.

2357
02:33:33,380 --> 02:33:33,760
Alright.

2358
02:33:34,500 --> 02:33:35,480
Got another vinyl.

2359
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:36,700
Thanks, Sarah.

2360
02:33:38,340 --> 02:33:39,820
Not too bad.

2361
02:33:40,780 --> 02:33:41,760
Got another one.

2362
02:33:43,780 --> 02:33:45,040
Oh, this is like playing.

2363
02:33:45,540 --> 02:33:47,520
No track playing.

2364
02:33:50,160 --> 02:33:50,640
Bada.

2365
02:33:52,040 --> 02:33:53,720
Signal found.

2366
02:33:55,420 --> 02:33:56,640
Tune track.

2367
02:33:59,740 --> 02:34:00,340
Tune.

2368
02:34:04,290 --> 02:34:05,050
Is this?

2369
02:34:07,050 --> 02:34:07,730
Calibrate.

2370
02:34:08,510 --> 02:34:09,710
Tune track.

2371
02:34:10,950 --> 02:34:13,590
How the fuck do I tune it?

2372
02:34:16,430 --> 02:34:17,510
Tune track.

2373
02:34:17,990 --> 02:34:18,750
Girl, I don't know.

2374
02:34:18,830 --> 02:34:20,390
I'm not a music person.

2375
02:34:20,710 --> 02:34:22,350
How the fuck do you tune it?

2376
02:34:28,260 --> 02:34:29,960
I just don't speed.

2377
02:34:30,300 --> 02:34:32,000
Morse code and tune.

2378
02:34:37,280 --> 02:34:37,580
Okay.

2379
02:34:39,140 --> 02:34:39,820
Reverse?

2380
02:34:50,520 --> 02:34:51,620
Am I tuning?

2381
02:34:56,160 --> 02:34:58,300
I don't think I'm tuning it, guys.

2382
02:35:04,560 --> 02:35:06,800
Alright, now your instructions are bad.

2383
02:35:10,520 --> 02:35:11,620
Is it the frequency?

2384
02:35:15,680 --> 02:35:16,900
Oh, it is.

2385
02:35:20,040 --> 02:35:21,060
It's green now.

2386
02:35:23,740 --> 02:35:24,680
Oh, there we go.

2387
02:35:24,820 --> 02:35:25,040
Okay.

2388
02:35:26,300 --> 02:35:26,880
Alright, there we go.

2389
02:35:26,960 --> 02:35:27,520
I figured it out.

2390
02:35:30,980 --> 02:35:32,140
It's the waves.

2391
02:35:34,480 --> 02:35:37,000
Having you here is taking more out of me than I thought.

2392
02:35:39,780 --> 02:35:40,940
I'm auto-tuning her.

2393
02:35:41,600 --> 02:35:41,980
I suppose.

2394
02:35:42,120 --> 02:35:42,820
Thank you, the Super Chat.

2395
02:35:42,900 --> 02:35:43,540
Thank you, thank you.

2396
02:35:43,600 --> 02:35:44,560
Just watch for that, too.

2397
02:35:44,700 --> 02:35:45,520
Absolute cinema.

2398
02:35:46,140 --> 02:35:47,920
Is it better or worse than the first movie?

2399
02:35:48,960 --> 02:35:52,220
First of all, you must be wondering why I'm like this.

2400
02:35:52,340 --> 02:35:56,680
Yeah, of all the things your husband could put you in, he
put you in a record player.

2401
02:35:57,540 --> 02:35:59,580
John, before I met him...

2402
02:35:59,780 --> 02:36:12,430
I was doing research into unnatural things.

2403
02:36:14,050 --> 02:36:15,930
Yeah, like worshiping the fucking devil?

2404
02:36:16,950 --> 02:36:19,910
His research was at the core of Inuit's schemes.

2405
02:36:24,330 --> 02:36:26,590
Everything was going so well.

2406
02:36:30,450 --> 02:36:31,970
Until I...

2407
02:36:35,160 --> 02:36:38,000
I'm already exerting myself too much.

2408
02:36:38,380 --> 02:36:39,900
I should stick to the point.

2409
02:36:45,070 --> 02:36:54,190
I've been thinking for a while On how I can reach John Oh,
the chairs are glitching out She's not strong enough to

2410
02:36:54,190 --> 02:36:59,350
stabilize this game It's so unoptimized I know he's trying
to find me

2411
02:37:02,490 --> 02:37:15,650
This is my soul Is trapped here There's not much I can do
But you You You have already achieved so much.

2412
02:37:15,950 --> 02:37:19,110
Yeah, I press on a file and I hit delete.

2413
02:37:20,470 --> 02:37:22,950
It's getting more difficult for me to communicate.

2414
02:37:23,590 --> 02:37:25,030
We need to be quick.

2415
02:37:27,070 --> 02:37:29,230
Okay, one more record, I guess.

2416
02:37:30,010 --> 02:37:31,030
I'm growing weaker.

2417
02:37:31,590 --> 02:37:34,030
This is the last battle I can create.

2418
02:37:36,930 --> 02:37:39,050
I'll explain my plan to you.

2419
02:37:39,490 --> 02:37:41,570
Oh, it's floating a wind now.

2420
02:37:41,770 --> 02:37:42,210
It's...

2421
02:37:42,210 --> 02:37:43,130
Oh, no.

02:37:43,150 --> 02:37:53,930
the vinyl is floating away um okay um oh okay there we go

2423
02:37:53,930 --> 02:38:02,150

wasted time explaining things when she's running out of

2424
02:38:02,150 --> 02:38:07,930

much time like five times

2428
02:38:58,380 --> 02:39:00,560
Our window is closing on us.

2429
02:39:03,700 --> 02:39:05,480
We don't need to listen carefully.

2430
02:39:11,940 --> 02:39:15,780
If we want to reach John, I will need you by my side.

2431
02:39:15,960 --> 02:39:16,820
Okay, less work.

2432
02:39:17,080 --> 02:39:17,960
More explanation.

2433
02:39:18,400 --> 02:39:19,080
Less exposition.

2434
02:39:19,920 --> 02:39:22,060
I can't think of any other way.

2435
02:39:26,450 --> 02:39:27,790
You have to.

2436
02:39:27,870 --> 02:39:29,130

2449
02:40:31,110 --> 02:40:34,230
Because it's like that has to be bait.

2450
02:40:34,790 --> 02:40:35,490
Like, why?

2451
02:40:35,610 --> 02:40:38,250
I'm just this random guy that found this PC.

2452
02:40:42,600 --> 02:40:43,420
New project.

2453
02:40:46,220 --> 02:40:51,200
Like, why does it have to be my my soul?

2454
02:40:54,720 --> 02:40:56,580
Oh, it's like a little demo.

2455
02:40:59,740 --> 02:41:01,100
Is there actually anything in here?

2456
02:41:04,180 --> 02:41:07,240
I just, yeah, I just want to play Fishing with Mavs.

2457
02:41:09,300 --> 02:41:10,960
That's all I wanted to do.

2458
02:41:12,880 --> 02:41:18,000
Is he in here?

2459
02:41:22,680 --> 02:41:26,000
I guess this was like the demo before he got all Satan-y.

2460
02:41:31,950 --> 02:41:32,330
Alright.

2461
02:41:34,250 --> 02:41:35,290
What's this?

2462
02:41:40,620 --> 02:41:42,580
Yeah, I just wanted mine, Sweeper, too.

2463
02:41:42,820 --> 02:41:42,940
Oh.

2464
02:41:43,760 --> 02:41:44,160
Nope.

2465
02:41:44,420 --> 02:41:45,300
There's the lake.

2466
02:41:46,660 --> 02:41:51,140
Oh, there's the creepy-ass lake with my dog, Nina.

2467
02:41:53,380 --> 02:41:53,580
Oh.

2468
02:41:55,120 --> 02:41:56,240
Try not to dwell in the spirit.

2469
02:41:56,360 --> 02:41:57,380
You have a job to do.

2470
02:41:57,740 --> 02:41:58,540
Push the boat.

2471
02:41:59,060 --> 02:41:59,460
Okay.

2472
02:42:03,780 --> 02:42:04,220
Come on.

2473
02:42:05,500 --> 02:42:06,660
Get in the boat.

2474
02:42:08,720 --> 02:42:11,460
Get in from the shed before you said, uh, okay.

2475
02:42:12,340 --> 02:42:13,260
Open the shed.

2476
02:42:15,140 --> 02:42:15,460
Alright.

2477
02:42:17,760 --> 02:42:19,220
That never seems to break.

2478
02:42:19,380 --> 02:42:20,340
Take the flashlight.

2479
02:42:21,660 --> 02:42:22,880
Alright, now I have a flashlight.

2480
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:24,680
Let's go into the scary lake.

2481
02:42:25,300 --> 02:42:26,080
Yep, get in.

2482
02:42:27,320 --> 02:42:27,900
Alright.

2483
02:42:28,940 --> 02:42:32,420
My name is Alan Wake and I am alright.

2484
02:42:32,860 --> 02:42:36,320
I assume I have to roll my boat.

2485
02:42:37,340 --> 02:42:38,260
Oh my god.

2486
02:42:38,320 --> 02:42:42,120
To the creepy light across the leg.

2487
02:42:42,340 --> 02:42:42,700
Oh my god.

2488
02:42:42,840 --> 02:42:43,520
Am I Gatsby?

2489
02:42:44,820 --> 02:42:46,140
I'm Gatsby.

2490
02:42:48,460 --> 02:42:56,570
Am I... Okay, apparently I don't know how to row boats.

2491
02:42:57,390 --> 02:43:02,430
I was like, am I getting closer?

2492
02:43:05,970 --> 02:43:06,710
Okay.

2493
02:43:10,650 --> 02:43:12,790
I'm getting closer to the creepy light.

2494
02:43:14,470 --> 02:43:16,150
All right, here we go.

2495
02:43:16,890 --> 02:43:20,170
Surely nothing bad's gonna be on the other side, right?

2496
02:43:22,190 --> 02:43:24,330
Yeah, do I have enough memory for the water physics?

2497
02:43:24,930 --> 02:43:26,630
Did I delete enough files?

2498
02:43:27,810 --> 02:43:28,790
Right at the spot.

2499
02:43:28,910 --> 02:43:30,090
This is where they found her.

2500
02:43:30,710 --> 02:43:30,930
Went.

2501
02:43:31,230 --> 02:43:32,030
They must have left.

2502
02:43:55,480 --> 02:43:55,920
Nina?

2503
02:44:05,470 --> 02:44:05,950
Nina!

2504
02:44:10,120 --> 02:44:11,480
Oh, Nina!

2505
02:44:12,300 --> 02:44:14,320
I need five pieces!

2506
02:44:15,020 --> 02:44:19,900
How can this game?

2507
02:44:25,500 --> 02:44:26,840
Oh my god.

2508
02:44:26,920 --> 02:44:27,600
Oh my god.

2509
02:44:27,720 --> 02:44:30,080
It did have my fucking dead dog.

2510
02:44:30,960 --> 02:44:32,800
Oh, that's her paw.

2511
02:44:33,080 --> 02:44:33,740
Dina.

2512
02:44:35,680 --> 02:44:37,120
Oh, Dina.

2513
02:44:41,360 --> 02:44:44,940
What if it knows I didn't sacrifice you, Dina?

2514
02:44:45,280 --> 02:44:48,000
I just need something powerful and personal.

2515
02:44:49,100 --> 02:44:50,180
That's so...

2516
02:44:50,180 --> 02:44:50,800
Oh my god.

2517
02:44:50,820 --> 02:45:05,200

only way my dog's soul was actually trapped in this game

that's messed up This is actually how you optimized your

2519
02:45:24,990 --> 02:45:25,330
game.

2520
02:45:25,570 --> 02:45:28,890
You gotta trap your dog soul into this game.

2521
02:45:29,230 --> 02:45:33,230
Just to make a fucking knockoff of GoldenEye!

2522
02:45:39,670 --> 02:45:41,070
Is that five?

2523
02:45:42,070 --> 02:45:47,210
I think that's five, right?

2524
02:45:52,530 --> 02:45:54,290

02:47:15,420 --> 02:47:16,940
Scan file.

2535
02:47:17,580 --> 02:47:18,220
Oh, me.

2536
02:47:18,520 --> 02:47:18,900
Oh.

2537
02:47:19,240 --> 02:47:20,420
Oh, okay.

2538
02:47:21,020 --> 02:47:22,340
Oh, that's me.

2539
02:47:23,160 --> 02:47:23,600
Oh.

2540
02:47:24,200 --> 02:47:27,180
That's what that's I'm in a jar now.

2541
02:47:27,200 --> 02:47:29,200
Don't don't like that

2542
02:47:40,630 --> 02:47:43,270
What the fuck is the sacrifice?

2543
02:48:04,160 --> 02:48:05,380
What do we put in here?

2544
02:48:19,490 --> 02:48:27,230
No, the Nina was the star I got the star out of here What
the fuck do we put in the sacrifice?

2545
02:48:36,620 --> 02:48:43,320
I got the sigil I got the incantation Who are we
sacrificing?

2546
02:48:47,920 --> 02:48:49,300
Oh, I don't like this.

2547
02:48:53,100 --> 02:48:53,780
Mindsweeper.

2548
02:48:55,540 --> 02:48:58,180
I think I got everything.

2549
02:48:58,340 --> 02:48:59,420
No, that's the thing.

2550
02:49:03,520 --> 02:49:03,920
Yeah.

2551
02:49:06,460 --> 02:49:08,720
We got Mindsweeper too.

2552
02:49:10,960 --> 02:49:11,740
I understand.

2553
02:49:12,040 --> 02:49:12,940
There's still one more.

2554
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:16,160
My clock?

2555
02:49:20,060 --> 02:49:23,320
Like, what do you want from me?

2556
02:49:28,130 --> 02:49:30,050
What do we put in here?

2557
02:49:30,990 --> 02:49:34,170
A soul may not show itself without a sacrifice.

2558
02:49:34,710 --> 02:49:35,510
I don't know!

2559
02:49:36,090 --> 02:49:38,090
Extract essence so that you may lure it.

2560
02:49:38,210 --> 02:49:41,450
Perhaps you need a friend to help you out.

2561
02:49:42,510 --> 02:49:42,550
Friend?

2562
02:49:45,090 --> 02:49:46,310
Am I gonna bait someone?

2563
02:49:53,670 --> 02:49:55,290
Wait, who am I gonna add?

2564
02:49:57,130 --> 02:49:57,770
Wait, Quinn.

2565
02:50:00,050 --> 02:50:01,930
Quinn, get in here.

2566
02:50:04,590 --> 02:50:05,150
I...

2567
02:50:05,790 --> 02:50:10,170
If I can only add Quinn, be like, yo, bro, get in here.

2568
02:50:13,490 --> 02:50:15,570
Didn't let me sacrifice.

2569
02:50:21,810 --> 02:50:22,670
A friend.

2570
02:50:25,810 --> 02:50:26,790
What can I do?

2571
02:50:29,650 --> 02:50:38,150
I'm a little confused Yeah the fucking pyramid scheme Like

I'm actually I'm actually stuck Is there like a friend to
help me out

2573
02:50:54,470 --> 02:50:56,830
Because I don't know what to put in a sacrifice

2574
02:51:03,360 --> 02:51:10,860
If only I can send a chain letter right now everyone to
check out this cool new game I've downloaded.

2575
02:51:14,520 --> 02:51:15,760
I can't talk to anyone.

2576
02:51:24,610 --> 02:51:26,830
No, I can't talk to anyone in the chat.

2577
02:51:28,450 --> 02:51:29,770
So I'm a little confused.

2578
02:51:36,130 --> 02:51:37,570
Also, I can't boot up the game anymore.

2579
02:51:37,690 --> 02:51:39,390
My game became a fucking star.

2580
02:51:40,310 --> 02:51:42,910
Like, what do I do with that?

2581
02:51:43,290 --> 02:51:45,730
My game literally became a star.

2582
02:51:46,390 --> 02:51:48,150
Like, I'm like,

2583
02:51:51,950 --> 02:51:52,510
Um...

2584
02:51:58,810 --> 02:51:59,370
No.

2585
02:52:00,710 --> 02:52:02,130
The audio player?

2586
02:52:02,390 --> 02:52:03,410
I don't think so.

2587
02:52:06,130 --> 02:52:07,610
Yeah, the audio player has nothing.

2588
02:52:13,120 --> 02:52:13,380
Oh.

2589
02:52:22,750 --> 02:52:24,950
Maybe the audio player is a game?

2590
02:52:25,090 --> 02:52:26,830
No, I checked it out.

2591
02:52:29,030 --> 02:52:29,830
Sorry, Sarah.

2592
02:52:30,850 --> 02:52:32,450
I'm stuck here, Sarah.

2593
02:52:32,550 --> 02:52:34,550
You gotta give me a bone right now.

2594
02:52:34,570 --> 02:52:35,350
I'm stuck.

2595
02:52:42,050 --> 02:52:44,150
I just don't know what to sacrifice.

2596
02:52:47,530 --> 02:52:49,030
Yeah, give me something here.

2597
02:53:00,490 --> 02:53:01,190
Yes, Sarah.

2598
02:53:01,430 --> 02:53:05,970
Maybe some fucking instructions would be better if you want
me to put my soul in it.

2599
02:53:09,350 --> 02:53:10,590
Tractor is missing.

2600
02:53:10,870 --> 02:53:11,350
Running this file.

2601
02:53:11,530 --> 02:53:13,330
We're going to render a GUI.

2602
02:53:14,150 --> 02:53:16,670
The slot on the right to harvest.

2603
02:53:17,290 --> 02:53:18,790
Oh, digital essence?

2604
02:53:19,390 --> 02:53:19,390
Maybe.

2605
02:53:29,870 --> 02:53:30,370
Nope.

2606
02:53:33,700 --> 02:53:35,300
Nothing is going in.

2607
02:53:41,700 --> 02:53:43,140
I'm just stuck on this.

2608
02:53:45,120 --> 02:53:46,260
Why don't I just log out?

2609
02:53:52,440 --> 02:53:54,800
I just, I feel like I'm logging out.

2610
02:53:54,920 --> 02:53:55,540
Okay, wait, maybe?

2611
02:54:04,510 --> 02:54:06,410
Okay, I don't know your password, man.

2612
02:54:18,920 --> 02:54:21,160
Sarah, I'm getting pissed off right now, Sarah.

2613
02:54:21,320 --> 02:54:24,420
So you gotta fucking hold my hand here.

2614
02:54:25,620 --> 02:54:26,360
Oh, maybe?

2615
02:54:29,060 --> 02:54:31,320
Maybe if I put...

2616
02:54:33,490 --> 02:54:38,130
Well, the name of the painting is not her password for
account.

2617
02:54:39,110 --> 02:54:41,710
I just want to know what fits into this.

2618
02:54:42,650 --> 02:54:44,950
What the fuck fits into the sacrifice?

2619
02:54:49,500 --> 02:54:51,400
Like, that's what I want to know.

2620
02:54:55,160 --> 02:54:56,460
That's the only thing I'm stuck with.

2621
02:54:56,480 --> 02:55:14,240
God yeah I put crashing ways but it didn't open it do I have
to find another dog like like Sarah you're not helping I

2622
02:55:14,240 --> 02:55:17,460
don't think I could find another dog Sarah

2623
02:55:26,160 --> 02:55:31,680
maybe there was something in here the new project

2624
02:55:39,710 --> 02:55:41,770
Was there something here that I was missing?

2625
02:55:44,950 --> 02:55:47,450
Because this was the only thing in the game fest?

2626
02:55:48,810 --> 02:55:51,710
That, like, I didn't get anything out of.

2627
02:55:52,890 --> 02:55:55,190
I don't know if I'm supposed to get anything in there.

2628
02:55:56,350 --> 02:55:58,410
Oh, maybe I merged with this project.

2629
02:55:58,550 --> 02:55:59,590
Oh, you're right.

2630
02:56:00,110 --> 02:56:01,930
I could merge something with this project.

2631
02:56:10,950 --> 02:56:11,970
Yeah, you're right.

2632
02:56:12,150 --> 02:56:12,570
I'm going to try.

2633
02:56:14,290 --> 02:56:15,650
I think I couldn't.

2634
02:56:15,730 --> 02:56:16,970
I remember I couldn't.

2635
02:56:18,890 --> 02:56:19,370
Generate.

2636
02:56:21,550 --> 02:56:22,730
Yeah, with Mind Sweeper.

2637
02:56:23,170 --> 02:56:23,750
The classic.

2638
02:56:29,810 --> 02:56:30,150
Oh!

2639
02:56:30,910 --> 02:56:32,350
That's what it was.

2640
02:56:34,870 --> 02:56:35,450
Oh.

2641
02:56:36,070 --> 02:56:36,650
Hi.

2642
02:56:36,790 --> 02:56:38,210
My name is Mind Friend.

2643
02:56:38,650 --> 02:56:39,110
Oh.

2644
02:56:40,670 --> 02:56:41,410
Oh.

2645
02:56:42,410 --> 02:56:43,370
Oh, God, you said it.

2646
02:56:43,830 --> 02:56:45,450
Why do I have a gun?

2647
02:56:46,170 --> 02:56:47,190
Oh, don't shoot.

2648
02:56:47,590 --> 02:56:49,550
Oh, is this for extracting essence?

2649
02:56:50,890 --> 02:56:51,650
Good idea.

2650
02:56:52,110 --> 02:56:55,670
This will be much easier than last time.

2651
02:56:56,290 --> 02:56:58,530
Ah, there's the extractor.

2652
02:56:59,570 --> 02:57:00,790
Oh, oh.

2653
02:57:01,190 --> 02:57:02,890
I'll just sit here.

2654
02:57:03,410 --> 02:57:08,190
Oh, I can use this gun to extract essence for you.

2655
02:57:08,650 --> 02:57:09,330
Oh, okay.

2656
02:57:10,010 --> 02:57:10,750
Okay, we...

2657
02:57:10,750 --> 02:57:11,350
Okay.

2658
02:57:13,770 --> 02:57:17,270
First, we will need everything to be hooked up.

2659
02:57:18,290 --> 02:57:21,990
Connect the power and scan the vessel first.

2660
02:57:24,370 --> 02:57:25,130
Wonderful.

2661
02:57:26,450 --> 02:57:29,330
Everything to be hooked up and ready to go.

2662
02:57:30,170 --> 02:57:32,530
When you're ready, just click on me to start.

2663
02:57:34,170 --> 02:57:36,930
Alright, let's extract some essence.

2664
02:57:38,650 --> 02:57:39,550
Do I remember it right?

2665
02:57:39,750 --> 02:57:41,950
Last time you sacrificed some foreign post.

2666
02:57:43,230 --> 02:57:45,290
Oh, that's what the fire is.

2667
02:57:52,220 --> 02:57:52,620
Okay.

2668
02:57:54,860 --> 02:57:55,540
Bookmark.

2669
02:57:57,400 --> 02:57:58,740
Alright, time to extract.

2670
02:58:01,560 --> 02:58:02,240
Great.

2671
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:04,280
What you should do.

2672
02:58:05,660 --> 02:58:07,200
Just aim and shoot.

2673
02:58:13,480 --> 02:58:14,880
Let's keep going.

2674
02:58:15,440 --> 02:58:16,480
Find some more.

2675
02:58:16,780 --> 02:58:17,020
Oh.

2676
02:58:17,140 --> 02:58:18,880
Okay, releases.

2677
02:58:19,400 --> 02:58:23,500
Goodbye, fishing with nuns in 20 summer days.

2678
02:58:27,440 --> 02:58:29,140
Let's take the whole form down.

2679
02:58:29,540 --> 02:58:30,120
That's right.

2680
02:58:34,660 --> 02:58:35,440
Oh, my god.

2681
02:58:35,820 --> 02:58:36,140
Bam!

2682
02:58:37,280 --> 02:58:39,020
Oops, well, that should do it.

2683
02:58:39,160 --> 02:58:42,820
Alright, so, uh, the form is currently down.

2684
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:47,260
We're getting DDoS right now, but we're currently getting

Oh, that's blood.

2692
03:00:03,710 --> 03:00:03,830
Oh.

2693
03:00:06,560 --> 03:00:07,520
Okay.

2694
03:00:08,440 --> 03:00:09,880
Which blood is this?

2695
03:00:10,700 --> 03:00:11,160
Oh.

2696
03:00:14,020 --> 03:00:16,580
Oh, it is my blood.

2697
03:00:17,680 --> 03:00:17,860
Oh.

2698
03:00:19,000 --> 03:00:22,380
Oh, I'm passing out soon, guys.

2699
03:00:23,040 --> 03:00:23,500
Oh.

2700
03:00:23,840 --> 03:00:29,340
Oh, I don't feel so good.

2701
03:00:35,250 --> 03:00:38,210
That's a lot of blood.

2702
03:00:41,870 --> 03:00:44,490
Me when I stand up too quickly.

2703
03:00:49,160 --> 03:00:49,260
Oh.

2704
03:00:53,760 --> 03:00:54,540
Did I feel okay?

2705
03:00:56,560 --> 03:00:59,040
Guys, I don't think I'm okay anymore.

2706
03:01:00,220 --> 03:01:02,080
Alright, if they're going to use my soul for a game.

2707
03:01:02,200 --> 03:01:04,320
It better be a good fucking game, though.

2708
03:01:05,360 --> 03:01:06,400
I swear to God.

2709
03:01:11,590 --> 03:01:15,410
If this doesn't get nominated for Game of the Year, I'm
gonna haunt your ass.

2710
03:01:28,500 --> 03:01:30,940
It ends up being like...

2711
03:01:30,940 --> 03:01:31,060
Oh.

2712
03:01:33,660 --> 03:01:34,560
Where's the flag?

2713
03:01:35,460 --> 03:01:36,600
Oh, I deleted too much.

2714
03:01:36,740 --> 03:01:37,200
Oh.

2715
03:01:38,560 --> 03:01:39,480
Oh, no.

2716
03:01:39,600 --> 03:01:41,540
Did my soul fuck up the game?

2717
03:01:44,080 --> 03:01:44,540
Oh.

2718
03:01:45,080 --> 03:01:49,840
Oh, no, my soul made into a parkour game.

2719
03:01:53,900 --> 03:01:54,780
No!

2720
03:01:56,360 --> 03:01:58,740
Not a parkour game!

2721
03:02:00,040 --> 03:02:01,780
Not a rage bait game!

2722
03:02:03,120 --> 03:02:04,620
Not even a shooter.

2723
03:02:04,840 --> 03:02:06,020
It's just rage bait.

2724
03:02:09,670 --> 03:02:10,950
What the fuck do I go?

2725
03:02:11,630 --> 03:02:13,710
Not a platformer.

2726
03:02:15,570 --> 03:02:16,450
No.

2727
03:02:17,230 --> 03:02:19,650
This is the worst thing it could do to me.

2728
03:02:20,170 --> 03:02:23,370
My soul has made it into a platformer.

2729
03:02:24,230 --> 03:02:25,390
How could this do?

2730
03:02:25,530 --> 03:02:26,850
They do this to me.

2731
03:02:32,450 --> 03:02:33,650
Where do I go from here?

2732
03:02:33,750 --> 03:02:35,030
Oh, I assume I have to go up.

2733
03:02:39,320 --> 03:02:39,620
Yeah.

2734
03:02:46,650 --> 03:02:48,210
Ah, made it inside.

2735
03:02:48,870 --> 03:02:49,770
Oh, wow.

2736
03:02:49,990 --> 03:02:51,550
I love this dialogue box.

2737
03:02:51,870 --> 03:02:52,670
Did you add this?

2738
03:02:53,110 --> 03:02:54,330
Finally, I can speak clearly.

2739
03:02:54,870 --> 03:02:55,750
It's me, Sarah.

2740
03:02:56,370 --> 03:02:57,430
Can you take me with you?

2741
03:02:57,650 --> 03:03:04,690
Okay Let's walk and talk we don't have much time John will
probably notice your presence soon

2742
03:03:08,000 --> 03:03:18,000
Yeah If that happened to me at least give me some wall
running This place is a total mess when you uploaded

2743
03:03:18,000 --> 03:03:26,800
yourself We're super close to the core of the system now no
more filler no more window This is where I've been all this

2744
03:03:26,800 --> 03:03:30,060
time Your help.

2745
03:03:33,080 --> 03:03:33,520
Here?

2746
03:03:34,680 --> 03:03:36,620
We've everything destabilized.

2747
03:03:38,020 --> 03:03:39,740
Oh no, I think I jumped the wrong way.

2748
03:03:40,340 --> 03:03:40,400
Ma 'am.

2749
03:03:42,840 --> 03:03:46,120
Ma'am, I'm gonna have to go jump down now.

2750
03:03:46,200 --> 03:03:46,880
We gotta reset.

2751
03:03:47,160 --> 03:03:47,780
Alright, there you go.

2752
03:03:48,880 --> 03:03:49,960
Yeah, I messed up, ma'am.

2753
03:03:50,200 --> 03:03:50,560
I'm sorry.

2754
03:03:51,540 --> 03:03:54,200
I'm really bad at parkouring in my own soul game.

2755
03:03:58,200 --> 03:03:59,480
Where do we go, ma'am?

2756
03:04:04,500 --> 03:04:18,300
Of all the game genres I could make with my soul It had to
be a platformer It just had to be a fucking platformer Not

2757
03:04:18,300 --> 03:04:20,480
even a shooter Not even a...

2758
03:04:20,480 --> 03:04:27,940
My soul literally removed the gun This is a ripoff I demand
a soul refund

2759
03:04:34,290 --> 03:04:35,330
Here we go

2760
03:04:41,300 --> 03:04:41,860
here?

2761
03:04:43,880 --> 03:04:45,620
Oh my god, it was here all alone.

2762
03:04:50,190 --> 03:04:50,190
Okay.

2763
03:04:51,990 --> 03:04:53,170
Just this way.

2764
03:04:58,180 --> 03:04:59,120
Okay, where do we go from?

2765
03:04:59,400 --> 03:05:00,760
Oh, it was here.

2766
03:05:06,210 --> 03:05:07,610
Okay, where do we go from here?

2767
03:05:08,870 --> 03:05:09,610
This way.

2768
03:05:09,930 --> 03:05:11,590
Oh, there's the red paint.

2769
03:05:12,170 --> 03:05:13,850
Oh, there's a scary red.

2770
03:05:14,690 --> 03:05:15,970
There's a memory stone.

2771
03:05:19,310 --> 03:05:27,490
we get all of them back into the system things should
stabilize be careful like she said be careful i'm already

2772
03:05:27,490 --> 03:05:49,870
here oh oh oh this is a memory of them when they met well if
you must know is that john a nerd yeah you seem like a

2773
03:05:49,870 --> 03:05:58,470
goddess that worship satan i used to live pretty close to
the sea Sometimes during winter, you'd have these enormous

2774
03:05:58,470 --> 03:05:59,070
waves.

2775
03:06:03,920 --> 03:06:05,900
It's terrifying, but I do miss it.

2776
03:06:06,580 --> 03:06:07,960
Ah, I can relate.

2777
03:06:09,060 --> 03:06:12,800
I'm from the UK, from a small place not too far from
Brighton.

2778
03:06:13,940 --> 03:06:15,100
Oh, yes, thank you, Super Chat.

2779
03:06:15,180 --> 03:06:16,020
Thank you, thank you.

2780
03:06:16,440 --> 03:06:19,400
My way to see was always most interesting when the weather
was bad.

2781
03:06:20,740 --> 03:06:23,400
I missed those gloomy stretches of gray coastline.

2782
03:06:24,440 --> 03:06:27,120
Well, we're both stranded away from the sea now.

2783
03:06:28,380 --> 03:06:29,100
Huh, yeah.

2784
03:06:31,580 --> 03:06:34,880
You know, I don't have to hang around here all day.

2785
03:06:35,760 --> 03:06:39,180
I was just checking if everything was still in the right
place.

2786
03:06:40,120 --> 03:06:42,020
Would you want to grab a coffee with me?

2787
03:06:42,160 --> 03:06:44,140
Ooh, you're in, John.

2788
03:06:44,540 --> 03:06:46,460
You made the biggest mistake of your life, you bitch.

2789
03:06:46,600 --> 03:06:46,900
Oh, sorry.

2790
03:06:47,180 --> 03:06:47,380
Sorry.

2791
03:06:49,500 --> 03:06:49,980
Sorry.

2792
03:06:50,780 --> 03:06:53,120
But you did make a really big mistake, girl.

2793
03:06:54,180 --> 03:06:55,300
Oh, yeah, sure.

2794
03:06:55,780 --> 03:06:57,220
That would be nice.

2795
03:06:59,040 --> 03:07:00,880
Look, sorry, I'm trapped in the video.

2796
03:07:00,960 --> 03:07:02,700
I'm trapped in the PC right now.

2797
03:07:03,080 --> 03:07:05,040
It took my soul, so I'm angry.

2798
03:07:06,520 --> 03:07:07,240
That's intimidating.

2799
03:07:07,960 --> 03:07:10,640
I don't know if ours are any more interesting.

2800
03:07:12,340 --> 03:07:14,380
I'm sure nothing could be further from the truth.

2801
03:07:15,560 --> 03:07:19,300
Yeah, she didn't see the red flags, even though his game is
literally a red flag.

2802
03:07:21,040 --> 03:07:23,680
It's literally captured the flag, and the flag is red.

2803
03:07:24,640 --> 03:07:26,300
I'm sure nothing could be further from the truth.

2804
03:07:29,440 --> 03:07:40,820
no he's english that was all the warning he needed did you
see that too it's like i was there again at the museum like

2805
03:07:40,820 --> 03:07:53,380
it was replaying a memory how we met me and john you know
despite everything he's not a bad person okay i wish you

2806
03:07:53,380 --> 03:08:01,000
could have known him how he was before from the very
beginning it was just oh Okay, there is a dead dog soul in

2807
03:08:01,000 --> 03:08:02,200
this video game.

2808
03:08:02,620 --> 03:08:05,780
We both had our own lives and we're just curious about each
other.

2809
03:08:06,180 --> 03:08:10,600
And even though it all happened so fast, it was actually
kind of fun.

2810
03:08:11,120 --> 03:08:13,400
We were there for each other at the right moment.

2811
03:08:13,820 --> 03:08:15,900
And it all just made sense.

2812
03:08:16,100 --> 03:08:19,220
Okay, Sarah, before the Satan game.

2813
03:08:24,010 --> 03:08:26,510
Oh, oh, it's freaking out.

2814
03:08:30,030 --> 03:08:32,950
Oh, the world is freaking out right now.

2815
03:08:33,950 --> 03:08:34,990
Oh, no.

2816
03:08:36,890 --> 03:08:39,670
How the fuck do I get to the other stone?

2817
03:08:41,590 --> 03:08:42,830
Nope, not like that.

2818
03:08:44,230 --> 03:08:45,070
Oh, my God.

2819
03:08:45,270 --> 03:08:47,490
I can't believe they made it a parkour game.

2820
03:08:48,390 --> 03:08:49,350
Oh, my God.

2821
03:08:49,450 --> 03:08:50,490
Oh, not the camera.

2822
03:08:50,490 --> 03:08:51,630
I don't like this.

2823
03:08:52,010 --> 03:08:53,910
I don't like the camera shakes.

2824
03:08:54,130 --> 03:08:55,430
Oh, my God.

2825
03:08:55,650 --> 03:08:55,970
Please.

2826
03:08:56,410 --> 03:08:56,910
Please.

2827
03:08:57,810 --> 03:08:59,290
I don't know.

2828
03:09:00,030 --> 03:09:00,570
Don't!

2829
03:09:00,830 --> 03:09:00,930
No!

2830
03:09:01,810 --> 03:09:03,490
Oh, oh, oh, oh, okay.

2831
03:09:03,690 --> 03:09:04,630
It rearranged itself.

2832
03:09:07,230 --> 03:09:08,350
Where is it, though?

2833
03:09:14,110 --> 03:09:14,470
Parkour.

2834
03:09:15,970 --> 03:09:17,550
Wait, but where do I parkour to?

2835
03:09:22,320 --> 03:09:24,520
I don't even know where to parkour to.

2836
03:09:29,040 --> 03:09:29,480
Here?

2837
03:09:31,540 --> 03:09:33,040
Where do I go next?

2838
03:09:48,920 --> 03:09:50,180
Does that thing move?

2839
03:09:51,800 --> 03:09:52,860
Well, that's not true.

2840
03:09:52,880 --> 03:09:54,800
Or did that thing started moving?

2841
03:09:58,060 --> 03:09:59,820
Okay, there we go.

2842
03:10:01,340 --> 03:10:03,180
Go this way or the other way?

2843
03:10:04,280 --> 03:10:04,860
Go this way.

2844
03:10:06,020 --> 03:10:08,520
Yeah, Jaw was a bad level designer, I admit.

2845
03:10:13,700 --> 03:10:14,900
Alright, this way.

2846
03:10:21,340 --> 03:10:22,660
Oh, this way.

2847
03:10:24,020 --> 03:10:25,020
Alright, parkour.

2848
03:10:28,360 --> 03:10:28,980
Parkour!

2849
03:10:29,200 --> 03:10:29,820
Parkour!

2850
03:10:33,400 --> 03:10:44,020
wait where do i oh this way oh my god it's so fucking trippy
the parkour section is so goddamn trippy i hope i'm going

2851
03:10:44,020 --> 03:10:58,200
the right way it's very hard to tell it's a yellow stone
here i gotta make sure i don't fuck up because apparently

2852
03:10:59,980 --> 03:11:05,420
apparently if i fuck it up sends me all the way back.

2853
03:11:09,290 --> 03:11:09,850
Okay, nice.

2854
03:11:09,930 --> 03:11:10,750
Oh, there it is.

2855
03:11:11,070 --> 03:11:12,190
How do I reach that?

2856
03:11:12,690 --> 03:11:14,330
Shoot, that's a dead end.

2857
03:11:15,730 --> 03:11:17,170
Maybe there's some other...

2858
03:11:17,170 --> 03:11:18,530
No, don't do this to me, girl.

2859
03:11:18,950 --> 03:11:20,290
No, don't do this to me.

2860
03:11:20,350 --> 03:11:20,810
What do you mean?

2861
03:11:20,930 --> 03:11:22,830
Or wait, I haven't... Oh, thank God.

2862
03:11:22,910 --> 03:11:23,670
Okay, I have an idea.

2863
03:11:24,290 --> 03:11:25,670
I managed to do this one before.

2864
03:11:26,530 --> 03:11:29,790
I think I can enable a debug tool that John put in.

2865
03:11:29,950 --> 03:11:32,350
Okay, it does take a lot of me, so we weren't.

2866
03:11:32,430 --> 03:11:34,870
I mean, you're not really helpful anyway, other than that.

2867
03:11:35,510 --> 03:11:36,110
Focus.

2868
03:11:39,250 --> 03:11:39,970
Are you debugging?

2869
03:11:41,550 --> 03:11:42,830
Oh, nice.

2870
03:11:43,750 --> 03:11:45,150
She's debugging it.

2871
03:11:45,990 --> 03:11:47,070
Lolly, thank you for the super chat.

2872
03:11:47,150 --> 03:11:47,370
Thank you.

2873
03:11:47,450 --> 03:11:48,950
Yeah, she's using console commands.

2874
03:11:49,290 --> 03:11:50,090
Slash no clip.

2875
03:11:50,390 --> 03:11:50,470
Oh.

2876
03:11:57,580 --> 03:11:59,640
What the fuck did you do?

2877
03:12:06,890 --> 03:12:09,330
Like, what can I do?

2878
03:12:10,510 --> 03:12:10,990
Oh!

2879
03:12:13,410 --> 03:12:17,210
Oh, I'm literally...

2880
03:12:17,210 --> 03:12:18,410
Oh, my God.

2881
03:12:18,510 --> 03:12:21,290
I'm fucking hacking the map.

2882
03:12:25,190 --> 03:12:25,830
Oh my god.

2883
03:12:26,010 --> 03:12:26,710
Okay, that's clever.

2884
03:12:26,810 --> 03:12:27,470
I like that.

2885
03:12:27,910 --> 03:12:29,210
I'm actually debugging.

2886
03:12:33,130 --> 03:12:34,490
Okay, get that gate out of here.

2887
03:12:34,650 --> 03:12:34,930
Oh!

2888
03:12:37,170 --> 03:12:38,790
Okay, oh, okay, okay.

2889
03:12:38,930 --> 03:12:39,710
I'm supposed to...

2890
03:12:39,710 --> 03:12:40,290
Okay, okay.

2891
03:12:40,810 --> 03:12:44,130
I was like, maybe let me get rid of my main platform real
quick.

2892
03:12:48,600 --> 03:12:49,700
Alright, I grabbed it.

2893
03:12:52,520 --> 03:12:54,600
I thought I was going to fall down into the abyss.

2894
03:12:54,740 --> 03:12:56,440
I did not want to go through that again.

2895
03:12:58,380 --> 03:12:59,180
Oh, they're on a date.

2896
03:12:59,980 --> 03:13:02,600
I've been talking today with Tobias about starting a
company.

2897
03:13:03,520 --> 03:13:05,860
And it seems like he's really on board with the whole thing.

2898
03:13:08,420 --> 03:13:09,120
That's great.

2899
03:13:10,980 --> 03:13:12,920
You know, I'll support you all the way.

2900
03:13:14,040 --> 03:13:14,480
Yeah, maybe...

2901
03:13:14,480 --> 03:13:16,360
Yeah, I should not have shot the platform I was on.

2902
03:13:16,780 --> 03:13:17,520
Just so you know.

2903
03:13:17,940 --> 03:13:20,200
It's going to be rough the first couple of years or so.

2904
03:13:20,940 --> 03:13:23,640
starting company is always like a negative.

2905
03:13:23,940 --> 03:13:25,600
Like Amazon's still losing money on Twitch.

2906
03:13:27,680 --> 03:13:29,940
So, it took a while before we have a game we can publish.

2907
03:13:31,200 --> 03:13:32,240
Yeah, that's okay, sweetie.

2908
03:13:34,640 --> 03:13:38,260
We've been doing fine so far with all the money laundering
for my paintings.

2909
03:13:43,120 --> 03:13:45,160
It's not like the Institute was paying you much anyway.

2910
03:13:47,100 --> 03:13:49,080
I already think that we have a good shot at this.

2911
03:13:51,580 --> 03:14:00,600
In the long run, able to make be more stable once we get
some investments in oh my god it's a pump and dump have big

2912
03:14:00,600 --> 03:14:06,880
companies invest in it and then cut the and then cut
everything off and run off with all the money I'm not

2913
03:14:06,880 --> 03:14:18,810
worried about the money I love our life like this besides
things are going well with my work let it be real I didn't

2914
03:14:18,810 --> 03:14:23,270
marry you for the money for the record I didn't either

2915
03:14:26,680 --> 03:14:28,100
I love you.

2916
03:14:29,060 --> 03:14:30,040
I love you more.

2917
03:14:30,760 --> 03:14:31,900
Ugh, disgusting.

2918
03:14:32,300 --> 03:14:33,060
You're so happy.

2919
03:14:40,040 --> 03:14:40,280
Okay.

2920
03:14:42,220 --> 03:14:42,840
Oh, John.

2921
03:14:43,080 --> 03:14:43,620
Hey, John.

2922
03:14:44,960 --> 03:14:46,360
Stop what you're doing.

2923
03:14:48,500 --> 03:14:50,240
How did you even get here?

2924
03:14:50,480 --> 03:14:51,320
Oh, hey, it's John.

2925
03:14:53,340 --> 03:14:55,000
Look at what you did.

2926
03:14:55,260 --> 03:14:55,880
Wait, he's a lot.

2927
03:14:55,980 --> 03:14:58,080
Ever is completely destabilized.

2928
03:14:59,100 --> 03:15:01,120
It's like months to repair everything.

2929
03:15:01,900 --> 03:15:02,020
Wait.

2930
03:15:06,340 --> 03:15:07,560
That vinyl you're holding.

2931
03:15:07,680 --> 03:15:08,840
What did you do to it?

2932
03:15:08,940 --> 03:15:10,340
That's my vinyl now.

2933
03:15:10,680 --> 03:15:12,320
You have no idea what's your message.

2934
03:15:12,420 --> 03:15:12,820
That's right.

2935
03:15:12,880 --> 03:15:14,420
She's mine now, John.

2936
03:15:15,000 --> 03:15:15,940
She's mine.

2937
03:15:16,480 --> 03:15:20,400
Who the fuck am I to have this goddamn device for a PC?

2938
03:15:21,620 --> 03:15:24,080
I need you to do exactly what I say.

2939
03:15:24,480 --> 03:15:26,280
That vinyl isn't some prop.

2940
03:15:26,920 --> 03:15:29,020
You're talking about people's lives here.

2941
03:15:29,820 --> 03:15:40,760
just yeah I'm a home worker so like whose PC is it not your
PC did I build my own PC and hack into John's PC and then

2942
03:15:40,760 --> 03:15:48,380
like fucking copied this entire PC set up like what the fuck
is going on I can see you're ready to have two

2943
03:15:52,490 --> 03:16:01,690
he's still typing third one's close it's like 300 units from
your position let me make a path.

2944
03:16:05,610 --> 03:16:06,310
Oh, oops.

2945
03:16:06,410 --> 03:16:07,510
I might have deleted that.

2946
03:16:11,050 --> 03:16:13,210
Shit, all these asses are completely corrupted.

2947
03:16:13,710 --> 03:16:13,710
Oops.

2948
03:16:13,990 --> 03:16:15,190
Slash Vote Kick.

2949
03:16:15,530 --> 03:16:17,510
I nominate to Vote Kick John.

2950
03:16:17,950 --> 03:16:20,130
He's ruining the game right now.

2951
03:16:23,760 --> 03:16:25,600
Alright, there's Dungeon Blade.

2952
03:16:31,060 --> 03:16:32,500
Alright, here we go.

2953
03:16:36,100 --> 03:16:39,000
We've got the Dungeon Blade parkour now.

2954
03:16:46,500 --> 03:16:47,900
I removed the skeletons.

2955
03:16:48,360 --> 03:16:48,800
The skeletons.

2956
03:16:49,620 --> 03:16:51,280
And then this should open up, right?

2957
03:16:51,440 --> 03:16:51,580
Yeah.

2958
03:16:54,870 --> 03:16:55,810
God damn it, John.

2959
03:16:56,050 --> 03:16:58,050
Can't even import assets correctly.

2960
03:17:00,830 --> 03:17:03,470
Like, why are there skeletons in my... Oh my god.

2961
03:17:03,590 --> 03:17:04,050
And a wizard.

2962
03:17:06,110 --> 03:17:07,090
Alright, there you go.

2963
03:17:11,450 --> 03:17:12,710
Sorry, but yeah, that's right.

2964
03:17:12,770 --> 03:17:13,830
We're nearly there.

2965
03:17:14,210 --> 03:17:15,670
And you better be sorry, John.

2966
03:17:17,410 --> 03:17:20,610
Just deleted the enemies instead of me shooting it.

2967
03:17:23,590 --> 03:17:26,370
I think if they touch me, I'm like back in the beginning.

2968
03:17:26,530 --> 03:17:27,950
I'm not risking that shit.

2969
03:17:28,630 --> 03:17:30,290
I parkoured so far.

2970
03:17:31,610 --> 03:17:31,930
Wait, what?

2971
03:17:34,250 --> 03:17:34,790
Oh.

2972
03:17:36,010 --> 03:17:37,490
Um, John, I fucked up.

2973
03:17:38,070 --> 03:17:39,370
John, can you fix that?

2974
03:17:40,410 --> 03:17:41,490
John, I...

2975
03:17:41,490 --> 03:17:43,730
John, I shot the platform, John.

2976
03:17:44,610 --> 03:17:45,270
There we go.

2977
03:17:51,430 --> 03:17:54,350
John, I can't get there, John.

2978
03:17:55,110 --> 03:17:56,490
John, I need help.

2979
03:17:58,190 --> 03:17:58,350
John.

2980
03:18:10,230 --> 03:18:11,470
John, please.

2981
03:18:14,250 --> 03:18:16,030
I can't reach it.

2982
03:18:16,090 --> 03:18:16,550
Oh, there you go.

2983
03:18:16,650 --> 03:18:17,430
I can reach it now.

2984
03:18:17,910 --> 03:18:18,810
JK, I got it.

2985
03:18:19,110 --> 03:18:19,670
John.

2986
03:18:25,550 --> 03:18:28,170
Okay, we'll have to jump on this.

2987
03:18:28,570 --> 03:18:29,890
Yay, we made it!

2988
03:18:34,810 --> 03:18:38,570
Oh, they live in a shitty apartment.

2989
03:18:38,830 --> 03:18:39,370
It's cute.

2990
03:18:40,390 --> 03:18:42,670
God, these flowers are pain in the ass.

2991
03:18:45,730 --> 03:18:47,170
I should take a break.

2992
03:18:47,530 --> 03:18:48,350
Your eyes again?

2993
03:18:49,250 --> 03:18:50,870
Yeah, it gets worse when I...

2994
03:18:50,890 --> 03:18:52,270
I worked so late.

2995
03:18:54,430 --> 03:18:55,690
You should leave it for the day.

2996
03:18:56,770 --> 03:18:57,830
Come back to it tomorrow.

2997
03:18:59,510 --> 03:19:00,170
No, no.

2998
03:19:00,970 --> 03:19:03,310
Samantha wants me to have the series done by next week.

2999
03:19:03,530 --> 03:19:04,150
Oh my god.

3000
03:19:04,410 --> 03:19:05,870
Okay, that's a nice painting.

3001
03:19:07,610 --> 03:19:08,930
Siri, I'm almost there.

3002
03:19:09,790 --> 03:19:12,230
But your eyes are your string or so.

3003
03:19:12,730 --> 03:19:14,150
I'm fine, John.

3004
03:19:14,910 --> 03:19:16,470
It's not that serious.

3005
03:19:18,450 --> 03:19:19,270
That's stressful.

3006
03:19:20,190 --> 03:19:22,190
You should really Yeah, I checked out already.

3007
03:19:24,990 --> 03:19:25,370
I did.

3008
03:19:26,050 --> 03:19:26,210
What?

3009
03:19:26,650 --> 03:19:27,050
When?

3010
03:19:27,590 --> 03:19:29,150
Why didn't you tell me?

3011
03:19:29,950 --> 03:19:30,730
It's fine.

3012
03:19:31,450 --> 03:19:31,930
Don't worry.

3013
03:19:32,050 --> 03:19:34,530
Oh, whenever someone says don't worry about it.

3014
03:19:35,730 --> 03:19:38,830
Whenever someone says don't worry about it, I think you
gotta worry.

3015
03:19:40,170 --> 03:19:41,430
What did the doctor say?

3016
03:19:42,850 --> 03:19:44,630
Is it going to progress?

3017
03:19:49,490 --> 03:19:50,010
Well?

3018
03:19:52,350 --> 03:19:53,590
Yes, it's...

3019
03:19:53,610 --> 03:19:55,050
Going to get worse.

3020
03:19:55,850 --> 03:19:56,650
Oh, just wear glasses.

3021
03:19:57,670 --> 03:19:58,730
I fixed these things.

3022
03:19:59,370 --> 03:20:00,630
Have you ever thought about getting glasses?

3023
03:20:01,650 --> 03:20:03,070
Just wear glasses, forehead.

3024
03:20:05,370 --> 03:20:05,750
Fuck!

3025
03:20:06,110 --> 03:20:07,890
Okay, I was not excited.

3026
03:20:08,210 --> 03:20:08,470
Fuck.

3027
03:20:10,150 --> 03:20:12,430
But there's a cure, right?

3028
03:20:15,910 --> 03:20:17,530
Let's talk about this later.

3029
03:20:19,750 --> 03:20:21,110
I'm trying to focus here.

3030
03:20:21,770 --> 03:20:23,170
Oh, there's no cure.

3031
03:20:24,350 --> 03:20:24,950
Okay.

3032
03:20:29,890 --> 03:20:31,110
Aww.

3033
03:20:34,010 --> 03:20:35,030
What was that?

3034
03:20:36,370 --> 03:20:38,090
When you picked up the stone.

3035
03:20:41,090 --> 03:20:43,070
Someone took control of the engine.

3036
03:20:43,790 --> 03:20:45,230
Such raw power.

3037
03:20:47,150 --> 03:20:49,330
I've never been able to control it like that.

3038
03:20:49,850 --> 03:20:51,170
Who am I?

3039
03:20:52,690 --> 03:20:53,370
I'm...

3040
03:20:53,370 --> 03:20:56,970
By the way, what you saw there, those are my memories.

3041
03:20:57,650 --> 03:20:58,450
They're private.

3042
03:20:59,890 --> 03:21:01,170
It's not your business.

3043
03:21:02,450 --> 03:21:03,990
You are an intruder, understood?

3044
03:21:04,530 --> 03:21:09,610
Okay, then why did you let me go, like, make this platform
for me?

3045
03:21:10,710 --> 03:21:12,270
I like, she's like, you're a stranger.

3046
03:21:12,410 --> 03:21:13,330
You're not welcome here.

3047
03:21:13,670 --> 03:21:17,230
Anyway, here are some platforms, and the next stone is not
too far.

3048
03:21:18,230 --> 03:21:19,950
Just keep picking up the stones.

3049
03:21:20,410 --> 03:21:21,710
Then we'll be done here.

3050
03:21:22,450 --> 03:21:23,710
And you can leave.

3051
03:21:26,490 --> 03:21:29,550
Yeah, I like how he's like, he's like, you're an intruder.

3052
03:21:29,890 --> 03:21:33,090
Let me help you make more parkour maps real quick.

3053
03:21:35,610 --> 03:21:36,170
Alright.

3054
03:21:36,890 --> 03:21:37,130
Yay!

3055
03:21:37,770 --> 03:21:37,910
Oh.

3056
03:21:40,490 --> 03:21:41,230
Mind friend.

3057
03:21:41,910 --> 03:21:42,250
Hey there.

3058
03:21:42,830 --> 03:21:43,710
My name is Mind friend.

3059
03:21:45,710 --> 03:21:46,030
Wait.

3060
03:21:46,250 --> 03:21:46,670
Mind friend.

3061
03:21:47,030 --> 03:21:47,710
What are you doing?

3062
03:21:49,110 --> 03:21:51,890
I think this intruder is trying to steal your gems.

3063
03:21:52,290 --> 03:21:52,710
Don't worry.

3064
03:21:52,930 --> 03:21:53,870
I'll take it from here.

3065
03:21:54,410 --> 03:21:54,690
Mind friend.

3066
03:21:55,130 --> 03:21:55,550
No!

3067
03:21:55,770 --> 03:21:56,490
Mind friend!

3068
03:21:57,730 --> 03:21:59,870
I played so much Minds.

3069
03:21:59,890 --> 03:22:01,790
You can't just do this to me!

3070
03:22:04,530 --> 03:22:05,730
I saw them logging into your camp.

3071
03:22:05,970 --> 03:22:07,370
At first, I thought it was you.

3072
03:22:09,690 --> 03:22:12,190
But then they started using all your tools.

3073
03:22:16,030 --> 03:22:17,190
I don't understand.

3074
03:22:17,730 --> 03:22:19,290
What about all the minesweep?

3075
03:22:19,450 --> 03:22:19,910
Oh!

3076
03:22:21,170 --> 03:22:21,650
Okay.

3077
03:22:21,950 --> 03:22:23,250
Oh, they kicked mine, friend.

3078
03:22:25,350 --> 03:22:26,610
They kicked them.

3079
03:22:26,810 --> 03:22:27,270
That's right.

3080
03:22:27,350 --> 03:22:28,450
Get kicked from the lobby.

3081
03:22:28,570 --> 03:22:29,410
I both kicked you.

3082
03:22:34,970 --> 03:22:36,710
My friend was actually one of my...

3083
03:22:36,710 --> 03:22:37,110
Oh my gosh.

3084
03:22:38,230 --> 03:22:39,370
Oh my gosh.

3085
03:22:40,410 --> 03:22:44,070
My friend was actually one of my...

3086
03:22:44,070 --> 03:22:44,610
No!

3087
03:22:46,330 --> 03:22:48,330
I'm fusing to game survives.

3088
03:22:48,610 --> 03:22:50,170
I made it a bit messy.

3089
03:22:53,030 --> 03:22:53,670
Okay.

3090
03:22:54,430 --> 03:22:56,630
Okay, now it explodes.

3091
03:22:56,810 --> 03:22:58,530
It did not explode before.

3092
03:23:02,090 --> 03:23:02,730
Okay.

3093
03:23:03,750 --> 03:23:06,270
Okay, got this.

3094
03:23:08,110 --> 03:23:09,410
I knew I forgot to reload.

3095
03:23:10,390 --> 03:23:12,130
Guys, reloading is very important.

3096
03:23:12,950 --> 03:23:16,270
I told you, this is exactly why I didn't want to get hit at
first.

3097
03:23:22,200 --> 03:23:23,480
Oh my god, it's a fucking...

3098
03:23:23,480 --> 03:23:24,060
No!

3099
03:23:26,360 --> 03:23:29,680
Oh my god, a fucking corner jump.

3100
03:23:29,780 --> 03:23:32,600
Oh my god, what is this fucking Minecraft parkour?

3101
03:23:32,840 --> 03:23:34,360
Parkour civilization?

3102
03:23:35,440 --> 03:23:36,000
Parkour civilization?

3103
03:23:43,050 --> 03:23:46,210
I can't believe they parkour civilization, me.

3104
03:23:48,890 --> 03:23:51,130
What the fucking corner jumps and everything.

3105
03:23:53,410 --> 03:23:53,730
Okay.

3106
03:23:54,850 --> 03:23:56,050
I'm just gonna destroy the plow.

3107
03:23:56,450 --> 03:23:57,150
Destroy the wall.

3108
03:24:03,380 --> 03:24:04,180
Oh, no.

3109
03:24:04,600 --> 03:24:06,040
Where am I supposed to go?

3110
03:24:06,680 --> 03:24:08,880
Where did my friend take the guy?

3111
03:24:09,020 --> 03:24:10,640
Where did he take it?

3112
03:24:13,640 --> 03:24:14,280
I'm...

3113
03:24:14,940 --> 03:24:15,740

3119
03:25:29,840 --> 03:25:33,140
you infuse my memories, John.

3120
03:25:36,160 --> 03:25:40,440
When the player put those stones in, it took a part of me
this time.

3121
03:25:41,360 --> 03:25:41,720
Sarah!

3122
03:25:43,260 --> 03:25:44,200
You think you can talk?

3123
03:25:45,400 --> 03:25:46,840
I can't believe it!

3124
03:25:48,020 --> 03:25:52,920
You're a wonderful, wonderful person who figured it out all
these years!

3125
03:25:53,680 --> 03:25:55,080
It's good to hear you, John.

3126
03:25:56,560 --> 03:25:58,080
It's been a long time.

3127
03:26:00,040 --> 03:26:15,020
this is incredible we have so much to talk about so much I
wanted to say so much left unsaid I'm so sorry for

3132
03:26:56,400 --> 03:27:00,140
The player is going to pick up the last stone, and then
we're going to end this.

3133
03:27:09,790 --> 03:27:12,230
Sorry, no, I built all of this for you.

3134
03:27:13,990 --> 03:27:16,270
Finally, you're stable enough to talk.

3135
03:27:18,410 --> 03:27:21,410
And now, you're just going to throw that all away?

3136
03:27:22,570 --> 03:27:23,670
That's not what I want.

3137
03:27:24,670 --> 03:27:26,570
I never asked for any of this.

3138
03:27:27,810 --> 03:27:30,550
I'm sorry, but it needs to end.

3139
03:27:34,540 --> 03:27:35,720
What What are you doing?

3140
03:27:36,900 --> 03:27:38,800
Oh, she's extracting for Sarah.

3141
03:27:41,540 --> 03:27:42,980
Oh, yeah.

3142
03:27:44,380 --> 03:27:45,120
Wait, Sarah.

3143
03:27:47,060 --> 03:27:49,240
Sorry, let's just talk about this.

3144
03:27:50,420 --> 03:27:51,100
Don't worry.

3145
03:27:51,560 --> 03:27:52,760
We'll figure this out.

3146
03:27:54,200 --> 03:27:54,760
That's right.

3147
03:27:54,960 --> 03:27:55,460
That's right.

3148
03:27:55,580 --> 03:27:57,240
Sarah's coming with me, John.

3149
03:28:04,390 --> 03:28:06,230
Well, this is it.

3150
03:28:12,880 --> 03:28:13,860
I hope...

3151
03:28:13,920 --> 03:28:15,560
is okay for you, Sarah.

3152
03:28:16,940 --> 03:28:19,500
This was your favorite one, after all.

3153
03:28:25,380 --> 03:28:28,400

3158
03:28:48,900 --> 03:28:51,140
All I wanted was to see you again.

3159
03:28:52,880 --> 03:28:53,560

3166
03:29:58,700 --> 03:29:59,200
Stop!

3167
03:30:00,160 --> 03:30:01,800
Just let me do this, John.

3168
03:30:02,940 --> 03:30:04,400
Rex X to confirm.

3169
03:30:06,000 --> 03:30:07,600
This action cannot be done.

3170
03:30:08,480 --> 03:30:09,440
It's for the best.

3171
03:30:13,120 --> 03:30:15,120
No, you can't do this to me.

3172
03:30:16,180 --> 03:30:17,680
You're doing this to me.

3173
03:30:18,780 --> 03:30:21,000
Is anything I'm saying getting through to you?

3174
03:30:22,480 --> 03:30:24,320
I want out.

3175
03:30:25,320 --> 03:30:26,420
It's time to end.

3176
03:30:26,480 --> 03:30:26,840
this.

3177
03:30:27,480 --> 03:30:29,460
Oh my god, I'm going to capture the flag, guys.

3178
03:30:37,990 --> 03:30:38,390
Okay.

3179
03:30:39,050 --> 03:30:40,170
Press X.

3180
03:30:42,850 --> 03:30:42,990
Wait.

3181
03:30:43,450 --> 03:30:43,650
What?

3182
03:30:44,750 --> 03:30:45,610
What does that mean?

3183
03:30:50,570 --> 03:30:52,950
Is this really what you want, Sarah?

3184
03:30:56,190 --> 03:31:06,410
I built all of this because I thought it would fix things,
but nothing was broken john i was happy with you

3185
03:31:12,330 --> 03:31:25,030
but then why did you have to go why did you have to leave me
alone i i don't blame you for what happened but i'm dead

3186
03:31:25,030 --> 03:31:35,290
john being stuck in your game doesn't make me alive to be
fair he did put her in an in a captured of that game when

3187
03:31:35,290 --> 03:31:36,210
she's an artist.

3188
03:31:37,070 --> 03:31:43,950
Like, if anything, if he had programmed a game that was
about art, maybe she would be happier.

3189
03:31:52,010 --> 03:31:55,050
The system cannot dispose of your soul without a
replacement.

3190
03:31:55,930 --> 03:31:59,230
Otherwise, it won't be able to complete the operation.

3191
03:32:01,670 --> 03:32:04,050
Do you realize what you're asking of the player?

3192
03:32:04,990 --> 03:32:05,790
Oh, God.

3193
03:32:06,150 --> 03:32:06,670
Oh, God.

3194
03:32:08,690 --> 03:32:22,130
I'm so sorry If I had known then Fucking you I knew it,
bitch I knew it I knew this was a trap Grab the flag to

3195
03:32:22,130 --> 03:32:23,750
upload yourself

3196
03:32:28,480 --> 03:32:38,980
But if you go through here You'll be back at your computer
And you can forget I'm not even going to let you finish I'll

3197
03:32:38,980 --> 03:32:40,080
be like Okay.

3198
03:32:41,500 --> 03:32:51,140
Are you really going to sacrifice yourself for someone you
don't even know whenever you're ready?

3199
03:32:52,040 --> 03:32:54,880
They immediately rushed in the car.

3200
03:32:55,180 --> 03:32:56,660
Yeah, I'm out.

3201
03:32:58,720 --> 03:33:05,200
Um, look, Sarah, like, I'm, you're dead and I'm not dead.

3202
03:33:05,720 --> 03:33:09,320
I, I, it's, it's, it's.

3203
03:33:12,740 --> 03:33:15,660
She's already dead, guys.

3204
03:33:16,020 --> 03:33:17,140
And I'm not.

3205
03:33:20,440 --> 03:33:20,660
So.

3206
03:33:24,240 --> 03:33:24,680
Peace.

3207
03:33:25,600 --> 03:33:26,820
Another right end.

3208
03:33:27,720 --> 03:33:29,000
Yeah, I'm sorry.

3209
03:33:29,180 --> 03:33:30,220
Sarah, look, girl.

3210
03:33:30,540 --> 03:33:33,500
I'm not dead.

3211
03:33:48,290 --> 03:33:48,770
Yeah.

3212
03:33:51,590 --> 03:33:54,610
Uh, I did it!

3213
03:33:59,490 --> 03:34:01,230
GG, Sarah.

3214
03:34:01,950 --> 03:34:03,970
I mean, yeah.

3215
03:34:04,870 --> 03:34:05,610
That's true.

3216
03:34:06,630 --> 03:34:07,630
We're alive!

3217
03:34:11,070 --> 03:34:14,250
You did all of that just to walk up.

3218
03:34:14,530 --> 03:34:15,450
I'm alive.

3219
03:34:22,840 --> 03:34:23,360
Yay!

3220
03:34:31,140 --> 03:34:32,880
He was right, though.

3221
03:34:33,020 --> 03:34:33,920
He was right.

3222
03:34:34,140 --> 03:34:36,560
I mean, like...

3223
03:34:37,340 --> 03:34:37,860
Why...

3224
03:34:37,860 --> 03:34:44,720
I mean, Sarah was already dead, so like, technically, like,
what am I doing at that point?

3225
03:34:44,840 --> 03:34:46,280
Like, I could still live on.

3226
03:34:46,940 --> 03:34:51,600
At that point, like, I, you know, I could get out and then
whistleblow, you know?

3227
03:34:55,690 --> 03:34:58,150
Eternal Damnation for Sarah.

3228
03:35:02,070 --> 03:35:03,610
I'm so alive.

3229
03:35:03,770 --> 03:35:06,910
I could still get his game shut down, guys.

3230
03:35:13,090 --> 03:35:13,150
Print.

3231
03:35:15,050 --> 03:35:15,790
Localization.

3232
03:35:16,810 --> 03:35:18,250
That was an interesting game.

3233
03:35:19,650 --> 03:35:21,830
Um, I remember reading the ARG.

3234
03:35:22,210 --> 03:35:24,610
Yeah, I could literally call the police on him.

3235
03:35:24,990 --> 03:35:26,050
And everything.

3236
03:35:26,390 --> 03:35:28,150
Because I live, Sarah.

3237
03:35:28,690 --> 03:35:31,910
Like, Who's gonna stop him from doing this to other people?

3238
03:35:32,290 --> 03:35:36,230
Now that I got out of the PC, I can call the cops on him.

3239
03:35:40,960 --> 03:35:42,760
Call the Sabbath, please.

3240
03:35:46,390 --> 03:35:53,250
I know, like, I remember reading the ARG, and it was
interesting that they implemented the things in the ARG into

3241
03:35:53,250 --> 03:35:53,950
this game.

3242
03:35:56,150 --> 03:35:59,690
But I also liked how, like, they made a lot of mini-games
into this game.

3243
03:35:59,750 --> 03:36:06,230
I was a little confused at first, but as the game started,
going on it like you know everything started like clicking

3244
03:36:06,230 --> 03:36:16,990
together like all the piece all the story points started
piecing together it was less horror though I will say this

3245
03:36:16,990 --> 03:36:24,250
is not a horror game it's definitely a thriller there was
some really good jump scares though the fucking no the what

3246
03:36:24,250 --> 03:36:34,570
was it the crashing waves jump scare that one was good what
ARG is based off it's the same one no players online let me

3247
03:36:34,570 --> 03:36:37,910
just tell cops if this weirdo has a deceased wife in his
computer.

3248
03:36:38,290 --> 03:36:40,470
That's just sure to get him arrested.

3249
03:36:40,890 --> 03:36:41,550
But stop.

3250
03:36:41,730 --> 03:36:42,690
Thank you for the super chat.

3251
03:36:42,790 --> 03:36:43,190
Thank you.

3252
03:36:43,630 --> 03:36:44,010
Thank you.

3253
03:36:49,040 --> 03:36:53,980
There were some moments, I will say, like, it felt like it
did draw on too long.

3254
03:36:54,080 --> 03:36:58,480
There were some moments, but, like, things did start
clicking together.

3255
03:36:58,580 --> 03:37:01,820
I think I could tell what, like, because I did see some
negative reviews for this game.

3256
03:37:02,300 --> 03:37:06,200
But, like, it's because, like, they didn't know what they
were expecting because they thought it was going to be,

3257
03:37:06,240 --> 03:37:14,100
like, the original no players online because no original no
players online was very horror focused but this one was more

3258
03:37:14,100 --> 03:37:21,520
of like like a thriller mystery versus a horror game so I
can I can see why like people who went in here being like oh

3259
03:37:21,520 --> 03:37:28,040
I wanted a horror game but they didn't really get a horror
game um but I think I the story was really interesting

3260
03:37:31,910 --> 03:37:36,390
yeah thanks for playing

3261
03:37:45,060 --> 03:37:55,720
oh oh the game just turns itself off the game just turns
itself off okay you know i want to know what the other

3262
03:37:55,720 --> 03:38:06,880
ending is like though i'll check it out no players online
ending all right there is a true okay wait no players online

3263
03:38:06,880 --> 03:38:19,020
wait all endings there's no oh a full playthrough okay all
right all right what is the what is the other ending for it

3264
03:38:19,020 --> 03:38:21,100
is it less anticlimactic

3265
03:38:26,770 --> 03:38:38,970
what is it like they're like oh what you gonna pick okay is
he gonna get to flag what happens oh this person also went

3266
03:38:38,970 --> 03:38:55,130
for the door first oh that's he also went to the door first
guys all right the flag ending I wonder if it like draws it

3267
03:38:55,130 --> 03:39:13,430
out longer what the fuck oh I did the bad ending oh no yeah
here wait that's it oh my they were both anticlimactic the

3268
03:39:13,430 --> 03:39:22,890
good ending was like him getting the flag and it was like
and then it's just black screen like like no i'm not even

3269
03:39:22,890 --> 03:39:31,410
gonna show it like i i can't even i'm not gonna it's that
it's it's actually so anticlimactic it just ends it

3270
03:39:31,410 --> 03:39:42,490
literally is like okay i'll play this i'll play it for you
yeah it's this just as it's okay the end uh yeah look this

3271
03:39:42,490 --> 03:39:45,930
is how it sounds and

3272
03:39:51,140 --> 03:39:58,840
then it ends And then it plays the credits.

3273
03:40:00,020 --> 03:40:01,020
All right, both endings.

3274
03:40:01,280 --> 03:40:05,640
The both endings are pretty anticlimactic, I would say, for
sure.

3275
03:40:11,140 --> 03:40:12,740
I think, yeah, no.

3276
03:40:14,640 --> 03:40:19,760
I love how nobody who's played this game chooses to
sacrifice themselves at the end.

3277
03:40:22,600 --> 03:40:25,300
Like, no, I'm not sacrificing myself.

3278
03:40:29,700 --> 03:40:31,180
But it was interesting.

3279
03:40:32,020 --> 03:40:33,440
It was an interesting game.

3280
03:40:33,900 --> 03:40:43,600
I do, I like, I felt like the start felt really slow after
like the original game portion of the original map.

3281
03:40:43,920 --> 03:40:45,760
Like, sorry, Sarah, but like you're dead.

3282
03:40:45,960 --> 03:40:46,320
I'm not.

3283
03:40:47,220 --> 03:40:50,620
I am, there are some plot holes because I'm like, who am I?

3284
03:40:50,700 --> 03:40:51,500
Like, hey.

3285
03:40:53,160 --> 03:41:06,260
because like clearly my pc was not john's pc like not john's
pc so i'm like who the fuck am i i was so confused because

3286
03:41:06,260 --> 03:41:16,840
like i i first i was like am i john because i could log into
john and sarah's accounts and and then but then like i was

3287
03:41:16,840 --> 03:41:24,020
talking to quinn as if i was like i don't know what this
game is so I was like very confused because like when I was

3288
03:41:24,020 --> 03:41:30,520
talking to Quinn in the beginning I was like what game is it
and everything I was like not really sure what that game is

3289
03:41:30,520 --> 03:41:41,380
and then but then like then I but I have access to like am I
a fucking hacker like like yeah and apparently my PC build

3290
03:41:41,380 --> 03:41:51,740
um fucking sucks blood out of yeah has a sucked the blood
out of your body uh option built into my pc for some fucking

3291
03:41:51,740 --> 03:42:02,320
reason so like like was i a fucking scammer like i took
control of john's pc and cloned it and then let's try to

3292
03:42:02,320 --> 03:42:16,360
steal his game company secrets like what fuck who am i uh i
was so confused at that like that was the biggest plot hole

3293
03:42:16,360 --> 03:42:20,080
for me because i'm Like, who the fuck am I playing as?

3294
03:42:20,560 --> 03:42:23,380
Yeah, oh, yeah, Blood has very natural cooling, guys.

3295
03:42:23,480 --> 03:42:24,480
I don't know if you know this.

3296
03:42:24,780 --> 03:42:26,720
Yeah, am I a vampire?

3297
03:42:27,380 --> 03:42:39,640
Like, because then I realized, this is not John's PC, so how
could I access John's things?

3298
03:42:40,080 --> 03:42:48,960
Unless it is John's PC, and John is, like, on some fucking
laptop, and he has a business overseas, his house and start

3299
03:42:48,960 --> 03:42:57,040
playing video games at his place like like you know john is
actually on business overseas and i'm just like a squatter

3300
03:42:57,040 --> 03:43:05,340
at his apartment or some um so yeah that's just like my main
gripes that i was like really confused with because i'm like

3301
03:43:05,340 --> 03:43:11,920
who the fuck am i playing as uh but other than that i think
the story was really interesting the jump scares got me good

3302
03:43:11,920 --> 03:43:19,420
um the jump scares did get me good though like the one they
did have like scares in but they're not good it was an it

3303
03:43:19,420 --> 03:43:29,660
was an interesting game um um it was interesting how they
expanded upon the arg of no players online and the original

3304
03:43:29,660 --> 03:43:37,620
indie game because the original indie game was very was like
it was the same map but it was a lot scarier it was i

3305
03:43:37,620 --> 03:43:46,760
remember it being a lot scarier because there was more jump
scares to it um um so um it was interesting to see how they

3306
03:43:46,760 --> 03:43:48,680
expanded upon the original.

3307
03:43:48,840 --> 03:43:50,700
I didn't watch, I didn't play the original game.

3308
03:43:50,880 --> 03:43:57,660
I watched Game Grumps play it, because it's like a really
popular Let's Play on their channel.
