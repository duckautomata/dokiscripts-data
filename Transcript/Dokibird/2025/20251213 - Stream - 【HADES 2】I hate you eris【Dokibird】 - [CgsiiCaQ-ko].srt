Anyway, okay, okay, let me, I pulled up some notes about

You know what?

15
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:29,390
No, no, no.

16
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:33,310
Okay, let's have a good environment for this story time.

17
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,670
Let me get a good environment here.

18
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:43,410
okay what room do i want to be in what i tell all right here

19
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:56,650
like um story time first before game if you were confused
you're like where the is my game okay we'll do story time

20
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:03,810
first so we gotta be comfy about this particular story so
basically let me see i wrote notes about this so we'll we'll

21
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,290
start from the beginning We'll start from the beginning.

22
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:10,530
So what happened was that a week ago, I had steak.

23
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,550
It was a mistake, as we all know.

24
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:20,510
So I had steak and I felt something right after eating the
steak.

25
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,930
I felt something wrong with my tooth.

26
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:29,770
I thought at first that I got something stuck in there,
which I was correct.

27
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:34,870
What I didn't realize was that I cracked my tooth.

28
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:49,150
I cracked it so the food was stuck in my tooth what I didn't
realize was that it was stuck in the crack so a couple of

29
00:06:49,150 --> 00:07:00,550
days after that um by the way that tooth was a root canal
tooth so if anyone's ever got a root canal before it um it's

30
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:09,090
already your tooth is incredibly weak after you get a root
canal So you got to be, which was pretty fucked up because

31
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,150
that was my chewing tooth too.

32
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:18,070
So it was my chewing tooth that was incredibly weak.

33
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:23,230
So I forgot about that because I got that root canal like
four to five years ago.

34
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,730
So I forgot all about that part.

35
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:29,230
So because I didn't know which tooth had the root canal.

36
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,530
I just remembered I had a root canal.

37
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:34,590
Anyway, so a couple of days after that.

38
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:44,310
my gums started being swollen but i felt no pain it was just
incredibly annoying because it was just this giant swollen

39
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:52,410
thing on my side so i couldn't close my mouth properly um
and i had a feeling it was cracked because i was getting my

40
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:58,970
tongue and feeling the tooth but i felt no pain because
later that's like why didn't i feel pain oh silly me it was

41
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:06,510
my root canal tube so there was no more nerves in there like
these people like how are you not in pain because i was live

42
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:11,670
tweeting my by the way i was live tweeting my whole dentist
adventure so every time he gave me bad news i was tweeting

43
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:20,450
it out um so be like how are you not in like fucking
unbearable pain and i was like thing is because it was my

44
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:29,550
root canal tooth the nerves are fucking dead that's what
root canal is you literally kill off the nerve associated uh

45
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:36,250
with that tooth so that's why i felt zero pain uh yeah
that's what root canal is you literally kill off the nerves

46
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:44,450
on that tooth and then like fill it up with um fill it up
with shit in it uh to like make it a tooth um so yeah you

47
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:50,210
remove all the nerves and then you fill it up with whatever
the fuck i don't know i'm not a dentist like i don't know

48
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:53,550
you fill it up with some fucking tooth stuff um

49
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:06,230
so that's what that's what the root canal is so that's why i
felt zero pain but that was bad that i felt zero pain

50
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:13,470
because like then i was just like oh it should not be it
maybe it'll get better you know i was just like uh maybe

51
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:19,730
it'll get better but obviously i should have went to the
dentist right like i should have went to the emergency

52
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:26,250
dentist right away because the indicator of whether or not
you should go to the emergency dentist is whether or not you

53
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,230
feel pain.

54
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,170
But I felt zero pain.

55
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:34,550
So I was just like, oh, I can just wait until my appointment
because I didn't feel any pain.

56
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:43,370
But silly me, it's because I removed the pain receptors from
that tube.

57
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:46,870
And that is why I didn't feel any pain.

58
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:58,170
So my body couldn't even send signals to me be like you
gotta go to the dentist right away so so I was just like so

59
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:04,450
I waited I waited for my appointment like a good girl
because I was like well clearly other people already had

60
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:10,810
their appointments you know they're ahead of me so I should
just wait until until it was my turn so because I was like I

61
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:20,310
can wait I'm not feeling any pain like I don't feel any pain
I can wait for

62
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:34,630
So, um, you're like, why didn't you check on the, because it
was all, all the way back at the back molar.

63
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,090
It's the second molar.

64
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,650
It's all, it's the top left.

65
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:39,310
It's not the bottom guys.

66
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:42,710
It was the top left molar.

67
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,070
So I couldn't see anything.

68
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,810
And like, like it was a root canal too.

69
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:55,550
So I can't see if like anything is wrong because it was so
you can't see it it's literally at the very back i looked in

70
00:10:55,550 --> 00:11:02,510
the mirror shine the light on it i couldn't even see where i
was swollen because the swollen part was behind the fucking

71
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:11,350
molar um yeah it was behind it's a very far back to it was
behind the molar where my swollen gum was that was pressing

72
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:18,730
against it so i couldn't even see the crack no it's so i
couldn't even see it like um it's at the dentist they had to

73
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:26,790
take to see the crack because they couldn't see it like
until they had to take like the close-up pictures to fully

74
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:37,110
see the full-on crack but anyway anyway I'm getting ahead of
myself so originally like I said um I realized on uh I think

75
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:44,910
it was Sunday I was like I gotta go to the emergency dentist
I can't close my mouth anymore because it's so swollen I

76
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:51,550
mean technically I could close my mouth, but it was so
uncomfortable because of how swollen the gums were, were

77
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,810
pressing against me.

78
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:58,090
So I was like, I gotta go to the emergency dentist and they
had one appointment.

79
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:02,410
And that one appointment was at the time of my apex
tournament.

80
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:06,430
And I was like, oh, clearly at the apex tournament is more
important.

81
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:19,090
So the thing is I didn't want to cancel the apex tournament
because I, I was, able to get the appointment 30 minutes

82
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:25,730
before the apex tournament was about to start and i felt
really shitty if i just drop out at the last second like you

83
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:32,230
know if i gave them a heads up like you know 24 hour heads
up then that's fine but it was literally 30 minutes before

84
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:39,890
the tournament was about to start and the the emergency
dentist was like look we have we have one slot open and it's

85
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:48,810
at the same it's at 12 p.m which is at the same time as my
apex tournament so i was just like well the next day anyway

86
00:12:48,810 --> 00:13:01,390
so so i was thinking i was thinking oh i do have an
appointment on monday anyway so i can just wait the next day

87
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:06,470
i can just tank it for one more day because you guys all
know i was talking about it too i was like i can tank this

88
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:14,270
for one more day um it's just like you know i'm not feeling
pain i know the reason why i wasn't feeling pain was because

89
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:23,090
the nerves are know at that time you know i was talking to
like my friends and my manager and i was just like should i

90
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:30,610
go do a dentist like should i get an emergency dentist like
my gums are swollen but i don't feel pain and they're like

91
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:35,970
you don't feel pain right i was like yeah i don't feel pain
and they're like no it should be fine just wait until your

92
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:43,150
appointment like as long as you don't feel pain like like
then you should be good but we didn't know it was the root

93
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:49,790
canal tooth and that's why i didn't feel pain so we were all
going in there with like the lack of knowledge like

94
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:56,110
everyone's like yeah yeah i didn't know

95
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:10,880
um so they're like yeah as long as you um you don't feel
pain then it should be fine but none of us knew that it was

96
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,060
because we all lacked the critical information

97
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,760
So it was four to five years ago because right after the
root canal a couple years later that I got my wisdom tooth

98
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:39,160
removed So I remember that I forgot about which tooth was
the root canal because the wisdom tooth removal was

99
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,380
superseded that

100
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,160
Anyway, anyway, by the way my gums aren't swollen anymore
after they fucking took the tooth the tooth is gone Like

101
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,700
they took it all in and then the swollenness disappeared.

102
00:14:54,400 --> 00:15:04,740
Anyway, I um back to the story uh yeah i took over my memory
slot i deleted it i can only have one slot for a dentist but

103
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:12,500
i have to delete it again um anyway so i was thinking okay
monday i have an appointment that should be fine because

104
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:20,060
like i managed to get uh someone canceled on monday so i was
like oh okay um because my original appointment was tuesday

105
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:25,500
so i was like oh someone canceled on monday day early.

106
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,660
I was like, yeah, yippee.

107
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,340
Anyway, Monday rolls around.

108
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,100
By the way, you guys were like, but you tweeted on Tuesday,
Doki.

109
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,180
Yes, this is the reason why.

110
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,080
You're like, wait a minute, Doki.

111
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:40,080
This story doesn't make any sense because you tweeted on
Tuesday instead of Monday.

112
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,140
We're fact checking this and this doesn't make sense.

113
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:50,320
Anyway, so Monday rolled along and I received the, I was
getting ready to go to the dentist.

114
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,200
I was so happy.

115
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,520
I was like, yay, my problems would be fixed soon.

116
00:15:55,080 --> 00:16:03,340
and uh yeah the evidence doesn't add up and so i was like
yippee i'm gonna get fixed soon and then i received a call

117
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:10,940
and the receptionist was like we're very sorry the dentist
um is sick right now so they can't operate uh they can't

118
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:24,920
check look at you on monday and i was like what i was like
what do you mean i was like this is what do you mean they're

119
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:32,100
like but we still have the original appointment that you had
on Tuesday so you can come over on Tuesday um you come over

120
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:45,260
on Tuesday uh for your original appointment so I was like no
you can't do this to me you can't fucking do this to me I

121
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:55,940
waited like a good girl I followed the rules I followed the
steps of bureaucracy, and I still have to come over on

122
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,620
Tuesday?

123
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,480
I...

124
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,380
Oh, thank God, especially in Canada.

125
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:09,460
So, so now I have to take one more day.

126
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,980
Yeah, I have to take...

127
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,940
How fucking dare you get sick?

128
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:17,680
I'd rather you just put on a face mask and operate on me.

129
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,860
I don't fucking care.

130
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:19,540
I...

131
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:35,260
so anyway so that's why that's why i did not get my
appointment on monday anyway so tuesday rose up tuesday rose

132
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:45,320
up i go in to the dentist i was so fucking nervous because
like i said you know my gums were still swollen it wasn't

133
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:51,280
that bad by the way i think it's it's swollen because like
every time i close my mouth like I try to talk or close my

134
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,060
mouth, I was irritating the gum because it's just like
scraping against it.

135
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:00,160
So it was like every time I wake up, like my gums weren't
that swollen.

136
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,920
It was just like a small bump.

137
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:08,800
But like as the day goes on, it just gets bigger because I
keep, I keep like irritating the gums.

138
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,400
So it, you know, it's like a pimple.

139
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,200
Like it's like a fucking pimple.

140
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,460
If you touch it too much, it gets bigger.

141
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:21,600
So like that was the situation I was in because every time I
wake up, it's like, like oh it feels okay it feels like

142
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:29,600
nothing and then and then when I talk too much or if I like
close my mouth too much like if I open or close my mouth too

143
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:35,960
much it was just irritating the gums too much so it gets
bigger so that was the issue too like every time I wake up

144
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:47,380
it's fine um and so Tuesday rose up and uh um and then um I
was at the dentist and I've never been to this dentist

145
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:54,160
before because like i don't know which one my mom fucking
got me in the past i just like called up the like all the

146
00:18:54,160 --> 00:19:00,060
dentist places and got the closest one but also the ones
that were good like you know i'm not going to some like i'm

147
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:09,960
not going to some like dentist at timu in the back alleys or
whatever like because like i'm because you know i want to be

148
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:18,460
sure because like i'm i don't want to, I want them, I want
to be sure that the tools are, um, what's it called?

149
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,740
The tools are sanitized and everything.

150
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:27,960
If it's going to go in my mouth, I got to make sure that all
the tools are incredibly sanitized and like, like the

151
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,340
dentist knows what the fuck they're doing because I don't
know what the fuck was wrong.

152
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:43,320
Like I, I had a feeling it was cracked because I was feeling
it with my tongue um um and um like i had a feeling that um

153
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:52,980
um that it was cracked just because like it was just me like
progressing it just from what i felt because i was like this

154
00:19:52,980 --> 00:20:04,600
this too feels like it's in half like that just feels like
two pieces that one singular too so so um i went in and then

155
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:13,920
we like we took pictures and everything we took pictures of
my jaw and everything and you know pictures of like uh my

156
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:25,120
teeth and stuff and um and then the assistant was like oh
yeah that's a crack tooth it's like oh okay at least we know

157
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:31,020
what the problem is he's like yeah that's yeah the x-ray
they did x-rays and then they took like close-up pictures of

158
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:35,540
where it is and you're like oh, we're going to look at that,
the second molar at the top left, right?

159
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,700
And I was like, yep, and they're like, yep, it shows in the
x-ray.

160
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,700
It's like, oh, it's where you got the root canal.

161
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,100
And I'm like, oh, that makes so much sense now.

162
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,200
No wonder I didn't feel anything.

163
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,800
Because she was like, oh yes, you can see here.

164
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,620
That's where you got your root canal, too.

165
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:53,340
And I was like, oh, that's why I didn't feel anything.

166
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,600
That's why I felt nothing.

167
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,840
Like, no pain whatsoever.

168
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:10,320
Because that tooth is fucking dead uh because that was where
canals are um and so she's like oh so i was like oh okay so

169
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:22,100
it's cracked what do we do and she's like oh yes um um um
well there's two options with a cracked tooth uh right now i

170
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:31,460
can't see how bad um how bad the crack is but um if it's not
too bad because she's like I can't tell really how bad the

171
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:38,380
crack is from just the photos and the x-ray so we'll get the
dentist to come in and check in just to be sure but if it's

172
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:47,540
not too bad we'll just put a crown over the tooth um and
then like and then it's like a little helmet so um a little

173
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:56,240
helmet over the tooth thing and um but if it's like way too
deep like way too cracked we're gonna have to remove it

174
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:04,060
because there's no saving that tooth so you know i in my
heart i was like because i never had a tooth extracted

175
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:10,440
before and also that root canal apparently was fucking
incredibly expensive so i was like what the fuck was the

176
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,240
point of getting a root canal if i was just gonna get get
that tooth removed anyway i might as well remove it in the

177
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:21,820
first place so in my heart i was like i would be nice to
just put a crown on it because like what was the point of

178
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:31,380
putting root canal a very expensive root canal by the way if
it was just gonna get removed in the end so in my heart but

179
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:37,260
you guys already see the foreshadowing because they did not
listen to my heart because i'm missing a tooth right now um

180
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:51,250
so um so anyway so they're like we're just gonna wait until
the dentist comes in to check on it to see like what the

181
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:58,970
plan was the dentist comes in and i'm like And he's like,
all right, let's check on this cracked tooth right here.

182
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,890
He looked in my mouth.

183
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:04,430
He looked in it for five seconds and was like, oh, yeah,
it's gone.

184
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,360
Just meant this man looked in my mouth.

185
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,140
Five seconds.

186
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,340
Five seconds.

187
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,860
He's like, oh, yeah, no, it's gone.

188
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,860
Just like that.

189
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,600
Nothing we can do about it.

190
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:39,000
like the assistant looked in my mouth the assistant looked
at all the photos and all the fucking eggs are like i don't

191
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,180
know i can't tell for sure if we have to remove it or not
we're just gonna have to wait i mean that's why she's the

192
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:54,040
assistant and not the fucking actual dentist but so you know
i had a little hope that we could save it but nope it was

193
00:23:54,040 --> 00:24:03,440
gone it yeah no he was like and then after that he was like
yeah no it's cracked in half like it's it's cracked in half

194
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:18,760
girl like we gotta take that shit out like yeah so yep it
was it was fully uh cracked in half um that was a yeah no

195
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:31,220
that tooth was over um um and so they're like we have two
options One, the thing is, I was like, one was to, like,

196
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:41,480
knock me fully out, but I will, but it would not be, like,
the day of the appointment, or two, they give me, like,

197
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:46,800
laugh, I think, I don't know what it's called, I think
there, it's not laughing gas, maybe it is called laugh,

198
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:53,460
like, the, the non-professional name was, like, laughing gas
or what, but it's, like, the NOXA, whatever it's called,

199
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,660
the, the gas that's supposed to make you, like, highs.

200
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:56,940
Yeah.

201
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:57,500
Nitrix.

202
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,320
Nitrix oxide.

203
00:24:59,800 --> 00:24:59,820
Yes.

204
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:06,200
So it was either nitrous oxide today, like on the day.

205
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,540
And then they take goink it out.

206
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,880
Um, um, and like they were like, oh yeah, don't worry.

207
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:19,400
Like if we do that option, you'd be able to like head home
like yourself and just like drive home.

208
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:22,760
Little did I know I don't drive, but they're like, you could
just drive yourself home.

209
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:36,680
You don't need you up or anything um you can really just uh
just go home or two um they give me some medication now to

210
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:43,320
like deal with it and then um i have to come back on a
different they have to make a new appointment so they can

211
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:54,520
knock me to out with anesthesia um but i'd be like super
fucking loopy and really high um if i do the option um um

212
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:59,740
because like they have to have like they have to have like
vitals monitored and everything to make sure I don't fucking

213
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:11,680
die in my sleep while they're operating so they're like yeah
and they're like oh yeah and um um and also like but then

214
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:20,660
there also there's another option where they give me the
medication and also put me in on nitrix oxide uh that will

215
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:26,160
make me super high and like super loopy too but I won't be
knocked out.

216
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,160
I just not be like incredibly high.

217
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,120
So, oh, sorry, sorry.

218
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,560
They gave me three options.

219
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,520
The one is general anesthesia.

220
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,440
But when I wake up, I'll also be like super loopy.

221
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:44,180
Or the other option would be like, they give me this special
medication to like, it would make me like super loopy and

222
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:47,880
also put me on nitrous oxide, which will make me double
loopy.

223
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,440
And I would need someone to take care of me.

224
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,360
Like take me home.

225
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,000
But I won't be knocked out.

226
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:54,820
I won't be knocked out.

227
00:26:54,840 --> 00:27:05,340
that i'll be i'll be like awake but like not not really you
know so obviously i was like who the fuck do i call to pick

228
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:16,200
me up like so i was worried about that i was like oh my god
nobody lives close to me who the fuck do i call and also

229
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:24,540
like i don't want to wait another day like i want to get
this shit fixed like today but i was real and i was also

230
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:36,400
like really scared if i could i would choose the anesthesia
where like i was just knocked out like i was i would if i

231
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:42,940
could because that was what i did for my wisdom too i just
got knocked out and i just went home um but i just i was

232
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:49,200
really worried because i was just like i've never been like
high before little do you guys know like i know some people

233
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:55,900
like oh she must have got high i've never been high before
so that like scares me too so i was really scared about all

234
00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:02,720
the options because I've never been high before and like the
first option you know I've never been on a nitrix oxide

235
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:08,920
whatever and I was like how would I react and she's the
assistant was like oh yeah like there's different types of

236
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:15,820
reactions um to it like you could be really relaxed or like
you know it could make you like you know feel like you're

237
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:21,080
high or like other stuff so I was so scared because I was
like I've never been high before like I don't know out what

238
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:30,860
the fuck is this option gonna be so obviously i want to get
that tooth out out right now so i chose the first option in

239
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:37,380
the end because like that was the only option where like
they could be like yeah we can take your tooth out now um i

240
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:45,360
didn't know how long it was gonna take so um i sat there
like um waiting you know like i was like i'm gonna go and

241
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:54,680
you're like by the way it's $600 you don't have insurance
right i was like no $600 so i was just like holy fuck okay

242
00:28:54,680 --> 00:29:04,440
this is a $600 bill to fucking remove a tooth and they kept
okay so they put the gas mask on me like the masking where

243
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:15,680
it's just on my nose and i was like and i in my head i'm
like i'm gonna inhale $600 worth of gas So keep on giving me

244
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,480
that shit

245
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:31,420
Yeah 600 Canadian I was like I'm gonna I was like I'm gonna
try and get $600 worth of fucking nitrous oxide In my system

246
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:49,660
So So um and they kept asking me um they kept asking me like
do you feel anything and i'm like i don't know i would be

247
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:57,660
straight with all of you guys i don't fucking know if i felt
anything so they kept increasing the doses they're like do

248
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:04,780
you feel anything any different i'm like not really and i'm
not saying that's if i wanted more i literally did not know

249
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:09,340
so they're like don't worry we'll increase the doses and
they kept asking me i was like i don't know if i'm feeling

250
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:15,040
anything and they're like okay we'll increase the dosage
again so they kept like increased they increased like four

251
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:27,020
times the dosage because i legitimately don't know i i will
be real with you guys i don't i think i i don't know if i

252
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:39,660
think it might have made me relaxed or some made me more
relaxed but i was not feeling shit i i i i was not i i swear

253
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:49,100
to god i felt like it nothing to me um i might have been
more i might have been a bit relaxed a bit more relaxed only

254
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:56,600
because they fucking joint the tooth out of me and i was
just but i also had numbing shit put in my mouth you know

255
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:06,680
like my mouth is fully numb so i can't tell if it's the
numbing the numbing thing doing this work or like the the

256
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:15,580
nitrous oxide making me feel relaxed it could be have to
numb me like you had to like poke stab the back of my mouth

257
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:22,780
you know stab the the back of the mouth and also like you
know stab the gums of where they had to take the tooth out

258
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:32,560
so they had to do all that shit too um so they had my mouth
was no pain it literally felt like nothing and also like i

259
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:39,200
had the nitrous oxide on as well so like like generally i
don't know i don't know if i felt anything but yeah so i

260
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:50,020
went there waiting for this shit to kick in I was like
waiting I'm like When the fuck would this kick in I was just

261
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:59,980
waiting I feel like I will let you guys know right now When
the dentist came in I was like Operation time And Sam

262
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:08,420
remember Shack that tooth And they're like You're going to
feel a little pushing When we do this And then Not even Six

263
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:18,200
minutes I swear to God It took this man five minutes and
it's like pop it's gone now and i'm like what

264
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:31,420
they spent more time fucking numbing my mouth and putting me
on nitrix oxide while i sat there and then they're like it's

265
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:40,900
gone you did it and i was like bro i fucking i'm paying 600
for this fucking five minute tooth extraction like that's it

266
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:56,520
bro that's yeah that's why he got 600 real he's a magician
yeah oh i think the worst part okay the worst part about the

267
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:06,640
tooth extraction was like they had to crack the tooth fully
in half so like because i could oh it's disgusting it people

268
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:13,020
cringe a little but I literally could it felt like bone I
could hear bones cracking because they were cracking the

269
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:21,940
tube so I could hear the tooth cracking in my jaw and it's
not a good sound it was not a very good sound and I could

270
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:28,480
feel it and then I they had to take it and have like they
took one half and the other half so I could hear it and but

271
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:34,960
then when they took the other half I didn't feel it I didn't
feel it but it sound yeah it sounds like snapping wood or

272
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:46,300
bones basically um it's not a good sound yeah it's very loud
so um so they did that and then but then when they pull out

273
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:56,880
the second half i could not feel a thing they're just like i
i didn't even realize it was just done so yeah so that's

274
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:02,880
that's basically what happened literally sat like when the
dentist came in five minutes it's over and out there like

275
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:08,020
and i gave a thumbs up They're like, it's over.

276
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,280
How do you feel?

277
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:14,100
Obviously, I can't say shit because, you know, my fucking
mouth was bleeding.

278
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,160
So I gave a thumbs up to him.

279
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,500
I was like, yeah, jobs done.

280
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:27,000
I, um, yeah, that, yeah.

281
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:30,220
So anyway, that's basically it.

282
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,480
I am miss.

283
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:36,240
They said that I don't have to get an implant only because
like a second motor is not.

284
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:44,740
really not really a big deal like it's not that noticeable
but I still have to heal so I could check back in a couple

285
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:52,740
of months just to see how it goes and maybe you know if it
you know if I feel like chewing is not fun at all with

286
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:58,620
missing molar I might get an implant in the future I'm not
sure yet I don't know I'm just waiting for it to heal right

287
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:13,240
now um anyway so um so it's all Gucci like um I sometimes
yesterday I felt like I was talking weird but like now I

288
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:18,140
feel a little bit more relaxed when I'm talking I'm still
not chewing on my left side obviously because it's healing

289
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:26,440
and takes like a one like one to two weeks for it to fully
heal um so so like we're just gonna see how that's gonna go

290
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:35,600
we're gonna see how that's gonna go um uh you know day one
obviously day one was pretty bad because you know i got a

291
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:46,840
fucking tooth removed so my mouth was bleeding so because
you know um my mouth was bleeding so like you know if i like

292
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:53,680
if i had to like um if i was brushing my teeth and i was
like rinsing my mouth and i was like poor and i'm like oh

293
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,480
that's blood.

294
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,760
That ain't good.

295
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,580
That's blood.

296
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,560
But what can I do?

297
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,120
What can I do about it?

298
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:07,880
There's like a fucking hole of where my tooth was.

299
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:19,060
Oh, the worst part, by the way, the worst part, like the day
after the tooth extraction, day after the tooth extraction,

300
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:26,420
I wanted to order an ice cream because I was like, I want,
you know, I thought like yeah you know i wanted to order ice

301
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:33,140
cream and you know because it helps with tooth extractions
or any tooth related things you get because it's like a it's

302
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:40,500
like a coolant you know it cools your your mouth and stuff
and i was like but you're supposed to get something that's

303
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:47,220
just plain like plain vanilla ice cream you know like you're
not supposed to grab anything with like bits in it with food

304
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:56,220
like with like toppings or mixings in it and i was like all
right i'm gonna order a nice dairy queen and yeah because

305
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:06,240
it's chilly and so i waited and i was like i was like yippee
my dairy queen vanilla ice cream is here i looked at it and

306
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,580
i was like why the fuck is it green like

307
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:24,580
why the fuck is my ice cream green and really tall so
apparently the uber driver um is very similar to last time

308
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:37,200
you know the one time i wanted ice cream so i got mint oreo
chocolate chip large dairy queen ice cream uh blizzard when

309
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:47,580
i ordered a small vanilla and i was like how the fuck do you
get that wrong why did i get a mint chocolate chip uh oreo

310
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:57,760
blizzard when i ordered a plain vanilla ice cream and like I
couldn't even eat it I couldn't eat it because the Oreo bits

311
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:07,300
would fucking get stuck in the fucking hole so I was just
like no how could they do this to me like I couldn't get

312
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:15,620
worse so it's because I looked at the receipt and it was the
same mistake like last time when I told you how I got the

313
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:26,840
wrong sushi order where like the person who had a very
similar name to me my premium premium ass um sushi box while

314
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:41,670
i got the cheap ass sushi uh so basically their name without
doxing myself was like daki daki curd and then so their name

315
00:38:41,670 --> 00:39:00,260
was daki curd and mine was doki bread so they got they got
daki curds order for me so Daki Gurd strikes again Yeah, so

316
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:13,420
Damn you Daki Gurd So so so they picked up Daki Gurd's order
which I was just like how the fuck did you fucking mess up

317
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,980
my name With fucking Daki Gurd?

318
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:19,340
There's like so many different letters

319
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:30,260
So So I got my, I got a refund, but it was not a full
refund.

320
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,900
They just refunded me $10.

321
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:36,500
So, so it wasn't a full refund.

322
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:41,020
Cause I, cause they still took, he still took my tip.

323
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:46,300
Cause like, it was like Uber Eats tips go, go off like
automatically.

324
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,060
So like he still got my tip.

325
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:51,920
So I was just like, this guy, this guy did not deserve my
tip.

326
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,480
So, so that was the worst part.

327
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:01,480
I think that was the worst part of the story.

328
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:05,540
Just the fact that I was not able to get my vanilla ice
cream.

329
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:09,180
Like, I couldn't even eat that ice cream because there's
Oreos in it.

330
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:11,580
If it didn't have Oreos, it would have been fine.

331
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,380
I could just eat it around the chocolate chip, but it had
Oreos in it.

332
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,720
And I didn't want to get that Oreo in the fucking hole.

333
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,600
Because that's the biggest fear.

334
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,320
That's my biggest fear is if I, because you can feel there's
a lot of pain.

335
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,240
If you get anything in the hole, you feel so much pain from
it.

336
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,740
And I did not want that to happen to me.

337
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,260
Anyway, my bagel is here.

338
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:33,860
Let's put...

339
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,120
Let me grab...

340
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,380
Let me grab my bagel.

341
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,100
The sandwich...

342
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:41,720
No, it's okay.

343
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:42,900
The sandwich is different.

344
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,920
It's like day four.

345
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,620
Guys, it's okay.

346
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,580
It's day four.

347
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,680
We're fine now.

348
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,480
Look, back then was day two, okay?

349
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,140
Day two was dangerous.

350
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,420
Day four, I'm practically healed.

351
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,500
Let me go grab my sandwich real quick.

352
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,440
I'm back.

353
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,820
I got my bagel with my chicken salad and salmon.

354
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,040
Look, you don't understand.

355
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,320
It's a really good bagel.

356
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:28,540
It's...

357
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:29,440
You don't understand.

358
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,720
This place has really good fucking bagels, guys.

359
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,880
You don't understand.

360
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,760
A missing tooth ain't gonna stop me.

361
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,020
Pain will, but that's okay.

362
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,540
all of it.

363
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:44,960
Don't worry.

364
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:46,740
All the receptors are gone.

365
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,760
So we should be fine.

366
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:51,780
Is it toasted?

367
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:52,900
It sure is.

368
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,860
Oh my gosh, it smells so good.

369
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:57,160
I'll take a bite out of this.

370
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:02,820
Ooh, I also had avocado added in.

371
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,720
Okay, let me try to eat on my right side.

372
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:23,020
Okay.

373
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,280
I took my bite.

374
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:30,520
I like this to be more cold I'm gonna put this in the fridge

375
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:43,770
I like cold bagels more than more than hot bagels it's good
I ordered from this place a couple of days ago and I was

376
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:50,050
like oh this is a good bagel place I'm not really not a
bagel person because I don't like how hard bagels are in

377
00:43:50,050 --> 00:44:03,530
general I just think cold chicken salad is better when it's
cold so I might and I put it in the fridge but I'm normally

378
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:12,070
not fat at bagels just because like usually like bagel bread
is incredibly tough um so I'm not like a huge fan of it um

379
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:22,250
but um but like um this one this one is good but like I
think I would prefer if the chicken salad if the chicken

380
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:30,350
salad was colder so I might put it in the fridge maybe or
just leave just like eat it later all right back to the

381
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:38,450
actual gameplay tab i won't be streaming for too long
because i do have a maid cafe live performance in four hours

382
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:48,570
i had to double check in four hours so so this won't be a
particularly non-stream um when's the tooth auction they

383
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:57,470
kept it i didn't even ask for it i was too scared i was too
scared to see the crime that i'd made to see the crime scene

384
00:44:57,470 --> 00:45:01,090
um yeah thank you for the So they kept it.

385
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:03,190
I think, like, it's for the best.

386
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:05,590
Oh, my gosh.

387
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:06,570
The funniest shit.

388
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:08,950
Sorry, I really want to talk about the stream.

389
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:10,450
Sorry, not the Game Awards.

390
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:21,370
I think the funniest thing, like, the post-aftermath of the
Game Awards was the fact that, like, Kojima's reaction was

391
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:22,550
so fucking funny.

392
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:24,970
Yeah, yeah.

393
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:27,230
I didn't even notice it.

394
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:30,230
He did a scoff and he rolled his eyes.

395
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:39,430
I was like oh he pissed and then he I don't know people
noticed it but he left during before they finished

396
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:46,810
announcing game of the year he actually got up and left
people saw it like circled into it was like wait isn't that

397
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:56,890
Kojima right there he actually got up and left before he
fucked oh it was not him okay thank God thank God okay

398
00:45:56,890 --> 00:46:08,770
someone said it wasn't him okay if it was him I'd be like
bro I understand like but his reaction though his reaction

399
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:18,010
was pretty good I fucking I love that reaction he's like
really hey Jeff he's like Jeff I flew all the way from Japan

400
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:22,170
I could be watching Zootopia 2 again

401
00:46:27,010 --> 00:46:34,530
how fucking dare you I could I was gonna meet up with I
don't know Tom Cruz, Jeff.

402
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:40,250
I canceled my Tom Cruz meeting with this for this.

403
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:47,890
He could have been fucking, I don't know, hanging out with
all the cast of the boys.

404
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:56,810
Oh yeah, another thing I wanted to mention is that they're
fucking planning on, they released the trailer for, for

405
00:46:56,810 --> 00:46:59,230
Animal Farm, and I'm so sad.

406
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:05,610
They actually made, I really want to talk about it because I
just, I was watching the for animal farm like um i think

407
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:10,790
like five minutes before the stream was like 10 minutes
before the stream was supposed to start and i was so sad

408
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:19,530
because like i don't know i don't they made the animal farm
movie the trailer for it a kids movie and i'm like animal

409
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:33,330
farm is not for kids like the message the the yeah the
message regarding animal farm is like not for kids like

410
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:45,090
Yeah, yeah, it's where out some, um, some animals are, all
animals are equal, but some are more equal than others.

411
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:54,630
Yeah, yeah, George Orwell does not write for children, but
they made the movie, like, very, like, even the music for it

412
00:47:54,630 --> 00:48:00,770
is not the music for it, some fucking, I don't know, some
Spotify top 100 song.

413
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:13,290
yeah no it just made like four legs good two legs bad but
then they made oh it's so weird it's so fucking weird i

414
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:19,250
don't know how to explain it you have to watch it to
understand it's just does not and then they made the main

415
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:21,130
bad guy steph rogan and he's like

416
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:35,510
no it's for kids 11 and up and literally here i was like It
says, wait, I gotta make sure you're chrome.

417
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:36,150
Okay.

418
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:40,250
Yeah.

419
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:45,530
Yeah, recommended for ages 11 and up.

420
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:47,170
Recommended, by the way.

421
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:48,630
That means it's parental guidance.

422
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:50,710
So as long as you have, yeah, it's PG.

423
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:55,590
So unless you have a parent with you, kids under 11 can
watch the film.

424
00:48:57,750 --> 00:48:58,290
Fucking wild.

425
00:49:00,970 --> 00:49:02,090
Fucking wild.

426
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:04,230
kids movie.

427
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:05,770
Holy shit, that's crazy.

428
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:07,190
Oh, Hades time.

429
00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:10,710
How many times do I have to beat up my grandpa?

430
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:15,410
We gotta do this again, because it doesn't save in the
middle of this.

431
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:21,090
Okay, I don't remember how I played, too, by the way, so,
um, we already talked here, so I can skip out of this.

432
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:27,740
Moonlight guide you.

433
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:30,260
Can I suppress me?

434
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:30,880
Take one back.

435
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,660
I already forgot what I said.

436
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,280
Oh, shit.

437
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:38,680
What did I have to make again?

438
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:40,300
I think otherwise.

439
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,820
Was there something I had to make specifically?

440
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,880
I mean, I can't make anything, honestly.

441
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:50,000
I don't even remember.

442
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:51,720
I already talked to her, too.

443
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:52,100
I already talked to her, too.

444
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:53,000
I was drinking a lesson.

445
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:55,000
I have an in-ca- Ah.

446
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:56,400
Alright.

447
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:57,520
Hail, goddess.

448
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,600
I already talked to all of them already, so I'm just gonna
skip.

449
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,680
I just don't want them to be like, why didn't you talk to
me?

450
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:09,940
I need a lot.

451
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:11,020
Okay.

452
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:16,120
I mean, I could buy a psyche, right?

453
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:22,400
Let's see.

454
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,240
I might as well just buy a psyche.

455
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:25,360
I feel like I need a psyche.

456
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:32,420
I can't go to... Oh, I need to buy something to be able to
go to the surface.

457
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:35,000
But I might... I'm gonna do the bottom thing.

458
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,220
I'm gonna get farm grandpa first.

459
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:38,620
Because I might as well.

460
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:40,420
Because apparently the top...

461
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:48,880
um you guys were saying how the top part the real world is
very dangerous and i'm like true that's very accurate so

462
00:50:48,880 --> 00:51:02,500
immersive haiti's um crazy that you didn't win best art
direction but i'm not gonna open that can i'm not involved

463
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:07,620
guys not i'm just seeing what i read on twitter i don't have
my own opinions

464
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:14,540
reciting i'm not that's not my opinion guys i'm

465
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:32,980
um i think i personally think i need more than i have the
main issue i mean i talked about it on stream i just find it

466
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:40,140
really boring when one one game wins all the one when one
thing just kept sweeps everything like yeah i mean like yeah

467
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:45,440
they deserve it but it's just so boring to watch It's just
not interesting to watch at all.

468
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:48,040
I say that about sports, too.

469
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:49,640
Like, esports and sports in general.

470
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:54,080
If one team is just going to keep winning, like, it's not
fun to watch in general.

471
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:56,420
What's the scuff?

472
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:57,820
What the fuck?

473
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,800
Nah, I like the stick more.

474
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:02,260
Oh, wait.

475
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:03,040
That's not my stick.

476
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:04,280
Wait, that's not my...

477
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,120
Oh, there's my stick.

478
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:06,900
I was like, where did my stick go?

479
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:07,960
Yeah, no suspense.

480
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:10,620
It's just a boring watch.

481
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:12,580
And I ain't about that shit.

482
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:18,040
uh what should i get for the downstairs

483
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:31,110
also i swear to god jeff did not care like about announcing
winners like because it's it's called the game awards but

484
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:37,570
the award section was so fucking fast he's like here's the
nominee here's the winner bam next here's the next trailer

485
00:52:37,570 --> 00:52:39,010

487
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:52,220
I could barely process who fucking won.

488
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:54,840
Um...

489
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,520
Let's just get good on the first level.

490
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:58,960
Yeah, they were speedrunning that shit.

491
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,700
And it was still the longest game awards, too.

492
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:05,220
Yeah, I remember we talked to them already.

493
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:09,340
We'll farm the downstairs first.

494
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:11,220
Okay, what do we need?

495
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:11,860
Uh...

496
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:13,080
Hold...

497
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:14,000
By will of night.

498
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,920
Do I get the upgrades yet?

499
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:20,660
When do I get the upgrades for weapons, chat?

500
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:23,840
Awesome.

501
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:25,320
Broken boss, thank you for the super chat.

502
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,240
Thank you, thank you.

503
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,300
This could have been an email, Jeff Kojima.

504
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:29,780
Thank you for the super chat.

505
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:30,740
Thank you, thank you.

506
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:33,760
I'm just gonna do...

507
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,360
I'll do 20% more horror.

508
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:37,900
Time run is just a normal run.

509
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:38,260
Yeah.

510
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:39,420
I have to buy all.

511
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:39,780
I did.

512
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,320
I just bought all the weapons.

513
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:42,740
Oh, is this for next up?

514
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:43,660
The next run?

515
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,120
Okay, the next run will get upgrades.

516
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,940
All right, let's just get...

517
00:53:49,360 --> 00:54:00,600
we'll do time again i guess by my birthright um time and
then uh percent of your i don't know i don't think i should

518
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:07,280
do time right you know i'll do one normal run because i i
don't remember how to play the game what is it okay there's

519
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:17,240
that and then that and then there's my cube okay i just
don't remember how I played a game, so I just gotta look

520
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,420
through everything real quick.

521
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:22,440
Uh...

522
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:24,180
Can you get anything?

523
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:27,140
No.

524
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:28,300
Alright, let's go in.

525
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:31,260
Yeah, I just need to remember how to play.

526
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:33,880
And then we'll go, we'll do time.

527
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:36,900
What's the normal run?

528
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:37,540
Right now.

529
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:38,740
This is the normal run.

530
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:41,120
Alright.

531
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:41,820
Aphrodite.

532
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,700
What do you have for me, girl?

533
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:44,820
You met many of us now.

534
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:46,940
But not yet proud Athena, I presume.

535
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:49,880
Apparently, she's too busy defending our front lines.

536
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:51,220
Take no offense.

537
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,020
Oh, yeah.

538
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,320
Of good manners, after all.

539
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:54,300
Where is Athena?

540
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:00,260
Okay, your attacks deal more damage to nearby foes.

541
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:01,980
Your special deals more damage.

542
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:03,340
My special is my right click.

543
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,180
Rushing damage surrounding foes.

544
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:08,800
I feel like rushing, right?

545
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:11,640
Rushing is better.

546
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:12,500
One, two, or three?

547
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:12,920
One?

548
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:18,640
do one two or three guys

549
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:34,260
one is good I feel like I was either one or three the thing
is um I don't want to uh oh it's weird oh wait there's a

550
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:43,860
what if I get freezing pathways and suffocating Erebus lead
to dead ends and very scarce are those who can navigate them

551
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:45,560
alright What?

552
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:54,040
My entire life to figure out Don't worry Yeah, see, I'm
trying to remember how to play So that I don't trust myself

553
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:54,820
right now

554
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:06,700
Oh god Oh god, like right now I don't trust myself to be
able to remember how to play Like I think my reaction time

555
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:13,900
too is like Very bad Because it's still the morning for me
This is technically the morning Always use more Aphrodite

556
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:16,680
more Aphrodite power-ups.

557
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:19,980
That's crazy that Hades didn't win it.

558
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:22,500
Wait, I just realized Hades didn't win anything today.

559
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:23,660
Oh, yesterday.

560
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:24,980
That's like insane.

561
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:29,140
That's great.

562
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,100
Hey, but hey, Stilkson, you got one!

563
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:34,400
Insane, Jeff.

564
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:38,040
You know, Stilkson didn't go... I didn't even realize this,
but...

565
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,360
Oh, it went back best...

They got one.

570
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:46,780
It was so fast.

571
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:52,820
I don't think you guys remember this but there the
announcement of them winning wasn't even like They didn't

573
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:11,480
was just like an aforementioned like a side note Yeah, it
was like they didn't even get to go up

but like the devs are like getting all the hate for it and

583
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:57,460

587
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:46,380
to them but like like claire is just getting like the the
fucking hate of it but i don't i personally don't think they

588
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:52,560
definitely did not deserve it the hate until we meet again
that reclusive witch of the crossroads must have been a most

589
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:59,100
unwilling caretaker of yours and kept you from your real
family till now at least techity taught you some survival

590
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:11,600
skills and had enough sense to finally acquaint us all right
the cast cost damage your foe is struck by lightning and

591
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:27,260
again oh um just don't get hit okay i feel like two yeah two
two for sure see there is hermes

592
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:38,780
yeah but it's like if you have to blame anyone just blame
jeff but like jeff and the And the judges.

593
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:41,180
Because apparently, what is...

594
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:43,780
The judges have, like, journalists in there.

595
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,080
I mean, like, you know, it's fine.

596
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:47,140
Some of the journalists do good job.

597
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:49,140
But, like, IGN is in there.

598
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:54,860
I have no mana.

599
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,180
I was not paying attention.

600
01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:56,680
I get that.

601
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:57,840
But don't give up on Azietam.

602
01:00:58,040 --> 01:00:59,000
I know you never would mind.

603
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:01,260
Probably just searching for some magical ingredients you
need.

604
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:02,000
Something like that.

605
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:09,920
Alright, gain dodge chance and move speed that increased the
more booms you have.

606
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:14,060
You channel your cast faster and your cast expires faster.

607
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:16,720
Most foe range shots are slower.

608
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:21,880
You need that chance and move speed that increases.

609
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,260
This is bullshit.

610
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:24,180
I hate the three.

611
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:24,920
Most foe range.

612
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:25,480
Okay, yeah.

613
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:26,640
Target target.

614
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:27,360
Great to might.

615
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:28,820
What a shot.

616
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:29,960
We have... Oh, wait.

617
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,240
Well, the shop might have boons too.

618
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:35,480
The shop might have boons or, like, poms or whatever the
fuck.

619
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:37,200
Nope, it did not.

620
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:37,800
Okay, whatever.

621
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:40,260
This shot fucking sucked.

622
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:40,740
It's okay.

623
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:41,620
I got decided.

624
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:46,460
She never loses heart.

625
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:52,280
It's almost precious how she strives with all the might,
brandishing that decorative spear of hers.

626
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:53,440
Oh, wait.

627
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:53,940
Is this dual?

628
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:55,500
Yeah, it's dual.

629
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:56,440
Dual boom.

630
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:58,280
She's shit talking.

631
01:01:58,280 --> 01:01:59,640
She's shit talking Aphrodite.

632
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:01,040
I inspire you.

633
01:02:01,540 --> 01:02:05,420
Though perhaps you ought to pay more attention to our foes
than to what I do with my spear.

634
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:07,140
So we can turn this battle in our...

635
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:07,520
Yay!

636
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:09,200
How do I always get The duo is what?

637
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:09,920
Like, it's hard?

638
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,740
You take less damage from nearby bows.

639
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:18,560
Boons of Afro-treats all foes as nearby.

640
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:19,380
Oh, shit!

641
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:19,680
Wait!

642
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:20,320
Nice!

643
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:21,500
That was good.

644
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:22,180
Hello.

645
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:23,300
Oh, this tainted gold.

646
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,320
You'll see that it's disposed of properly, Lord Keron.

647
01:02:32,650 --> 01:02:36,390
I long to see that night.

648
01:02:36,890 --> 01:02:37,690
Alright, here we go.

649
01:02:42,190 --> 01:02:54,170
sister oh wait hey wait where is she wait she said that she
has my back oh there she is oh she did nothing okay cool

Alright.

654
01:03:17,730 --> 01:03:19,210
Nice moral support.

655
01:03:20,890 --> 01:03:22,230
Yeah, I killed him twice.

656
01:03:22,790 --> 01:03:24,730
I didn't expect the second time, but it worked.

657
01:03:25,630 --> 01:03:26,170
How'd you do it?

658
01:03:26,590 --> 01:03:28,770
Found some exploitable weakness, something like that.

659
01:03:30,730 --> 01:03:31,770
I mean, he's just old.

660
01:03:32,870 --> 01:03:37,270
He's very powerful, but must have underestimated my ability
to resist his tricks.

661
01:03:37,870 --> 01:03:39,270
Look, he's very old.

662
01:03:41,650 --> 01:03:50,290
underestimate you though must have his vulnerabilities the
old are seldom wise and often weak right he's bloodied go

663
01:03:50,290 --> 01:04:03,050
for the kill yay see i told you he's old uh piercing shot
flies towards any foes damaged by your cast oh wait three

664
01:04:03,050 --> 01:04:10,290
sounds good closure and task may take critical damage from
your attacks oh i don't know i don't two

665
01:04:15,130 --> 01:04:26,670
I do cast a lot I don't have Oh yeah I don't have wing no
Cast is just a cue That doesn't require mana But it's just

666
01:04:26,670 --> 01:04:28,570
It's a cast I can just press it

667
01:04:31,630 --> 01:04:46,320
I'm not cast Uh Yeah I'm just not good I'm not doing like
the holding one Yeah but I'm not holding it Yeah Oh, three

668
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:47,340
needs mana.

669
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:50,180
Use mana for a bind.

670
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:51,820
Oh, okay, I'll use two.

671
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:55,000
Very well.

672
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:56,460
Yeah, I have zero mana, guys.

673
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:56,920
Oh, hey.

674
01:04:57,380 --> 01:04:57,860
Moonstone.

675
01:04:58,520 --> 01:04:59,160
More reagents.

676
01:04:59,420 --> 01:05:00,440
I'll go for Zeus.

677
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:01,880
I feel like Zeus.

678
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:04,480
Actually, I can get a different...

679
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:05,000
Guys.

680
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:07,560
Dimitri or Zeus, guys?

681
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:08,760
Which is better?

682
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:13,040
Dimitri or Zeus?

683
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:15,420
I'm not even timed, so what the fuck am I positive?

684
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:15,720
for.

685
01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:16,760
I don't know.

686
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:18,280
I already have a Zeus thing.

687
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:19,060
Or Demeter.

688
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:20,240
Sorry, Demeter.

689
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:25,560
Uh...

690
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:26,760
That's been a week.

691
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,900
I haven't had...

692
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:32,000
Maybe I'll get a good cast too.

693
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:34,680
Okay.

694
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:35,580
Oh my god.

695
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:36,500
Fuck these ladies.

696
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:40,740
Okay.

697
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:43,980
Alright, that's fine.

698
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:46,200
Whoa!

699
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:49,680
Alright.

700
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:50,920
Wee!

701
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:51,400
Goodbye.

702
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:56,280
Normally, sweet Aphrodite's power over beauty.

703
01:05:56,340 --> 01:05:57,360
Oh my gosh, this is another duo?

704
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:58,940
There's no shortage of entertainment.

705
01:05:59,220 --> 01:06:01,840
Why is she talking after talking shit to Aphrodite?

706
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:06,020
Is there another duo?

707
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:09,580
Oh no, she just felt like talking shit.

708
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,160
She just...

709
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:12,360
Oh!

710
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:13,500
Wait, one!

711
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:13,960
One.

712
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:20,020
Well, no, she just, you know, Aphrodite just took a random
shred.

713
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:23,140
Everyone just has beef with her.

714
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:24,360
Excellent.

715
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:26,180
I was like, whoa.

716
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:27,840
Oh, moon.

717
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:30,220
Oh, no.

718
01:06:32,820 --> 01:06:33,340
Nice.

719
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:36,920
Oh, I missed when...

720
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:38,600
I wish my attack was more range.

721
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:40,480
I'll miss that.

722
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:41,060
It's fine.

723
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:41,820
I got freeze.

724
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:42,400
It's okay.

725
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:44,100
I got freeze.

726
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:52,680
get out of here okay I just need something where I could
like throw my cast out and then we should be good then we

727
01:06:52,680 --> 01:07:02,220
have a good build yeah I did that but like I can't go up yet
I can't breathe human air apparently perhaps our plan

728
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:06,860
required this new phase hmm

729
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:19,200
I can't touch grass yet grass hurts me a lot let me
nightmare with her own abilities for five seconds, 100.

730
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:20,260
I have no magic.

731
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:26,180
I might as well just get two.

732
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:28,800
I have no magic whatsoever.

733
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:30,660
It doesn't really matter what I pick.

734
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:32,840
I literally have six magic.

735
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:38,120
Maybe this time they'll have stuff in the shop.

736
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:39,320
You know?

737
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:43,080
Maybe.

738
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:44,700
Oh, see guys, I told you.

739
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:49,000
Yeah, I don't know what that does, but yeah.

740
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:55,040
When you sprint, hit the first foe, you run into a blast
that knocks.

741
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:57,340
When you claim rewards other than boons or...

742
01:07:57,340 --> 01:07:57,540
Oh!

743
01:07:58,160 --> 01:07:58,900
We want that.

744
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:03,980
When you reclaim boons, we're a cop.

745
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:04,860
Oh, wait.

746
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:07,620
Yeah, too.

747
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:08,560
It's Gambatown.

748
01:08:11,060 --> 01:08:11,460
Gambatown.

749
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:14,640
Oh, I could have got food.

750
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:14,960
Whoops.

751
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:24,580
up money for food i've vanquished kronos everything you've
trained me to do yet still you stand in my way still more to

752
01:08:24,580 --> 01:08:36,300
learn even now now yay gambit time that tinge of frustration
you expressed i would see you rid yourself of it in your

753
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:38,460
attempts to rid yourself of me

754
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:49,140
yeah oh my god i'm trying to remember how fighter Why are
you no freeze?

755
01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:52,920
Why are you no freeze?

756
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:56,120
What's the point of getting freeze if you don't freeze?

757
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:58,040
Oh, God.

758
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:00,420
It's okay.

759
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:04,440
Alright, alright.

760
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:05,220
Oh, my God.

761
01:09:05,260 --> 01:09:06,440
I thought that was a person.

762
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:08,000
I forgot they're green.

763
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,160
I was like, where is she?

764
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:13,000
It's over here.

765
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:13,960
Oh, it's Toho time.

766
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:17,180
Toho.

767
01:09:17,180 --> 01:09:19,000
Really bad Toho though.

768
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:19,900
Oh shit.

769
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:39,740
I'm sorry Toho was pretty scary Oh my god, fuck Okay It's
okay Cheap time Oh god.

770
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:40,280
Oh god.

771
01:09:40,460 --> 01:09:41,160
Oh god.

772
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:41,760
Oh, it's okay.

773
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:42,580
I'm okay.

774
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:44,520
Oh, it's okay.

775
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:44,920

No, I already have a lot of HP.

792
01:11:56,810 --> 01:11:58,370
I should grab HP upgrades, though.

793
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:04,470
Nah.

794
01:12:06,070 --> 01:12:07,950
I'm just going to go grab some HP upgrades.

795
01:12:09,210 --> 01:12:09,490
Oh, hey!

796
01:12:10,430 --> 01:12:11,210
He's here.

797
01:12:12,590 --> 01:12:13,550
Oh, 16.

798
01:12:13,730 --> 01:12:14,010
Okay.

799
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:15,550
That hurts.

800
01:12:16,990 --> 01:12:17,870
Hello Chaos!

801
01:12:19,130 --> 01:12:20,590
Have I given Chaos a gift yet?

802
01:12:20,710 --> 01:12:21,410
I don't remember.

803
01:12:23,290 --> 01:12:29,490
So I have seen that the serpent of the three fates found you
in that hidden place, you relate to your secret did he not?

804
01:12:31,450 --> 01:12:32,910
You mean Moros?

805
01:12:33,590 --> 01:12:34,990
His secret was about the surface.

806
01:12:35,410 --> 01:12:36,750
About how I can survive up there.

807
01:12:37,490 --> 01:12:40,990
I know this goes against the fates' designs, but Olympus
needs me.

808
01:12:44,810 --> 01:12:46,730
I'm giving track of my time.

809
01:12:46,990 --> 01:12:51,250
I'm trying to make sure I don't miss my maid cafe
appearance.

810
01:12:57,550 --> 01:12:57,990
But...

811
01:12:57,990 --> 01:12:58,190
Oh!

812
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:01,010
Theodic favor.

813
01:13:02,390 --> 01:13:03,090
Oh, nice.

814
01:13:04,170 --> 01:13:05,210
He gave me something.

815
01:13:05,670 --> 01:13:08,190
I don't know what it is, but he gave me a little gift.

816
01:13:09,870 --> 01:13:12,170
You take afterwards your channel, your moves.

817
01:13:12,270 --> 01:13:13,470
Okay, I have no magic.

818
01:13:15,290 --> 01:13:16,510
Next to you, you have one fear.

819
01:13:16,590 --> 01:13:16,930
Oh!

820
01:13:18,170 --> 01:13:30,110
Dash makes you lose Afterwards gain Oh Three I should grab

There you go.

824
01:13:49,850 --> 01:13:50,270
Oh, shit.

825
01:13:50,390 --> 01:13:52,830
I didn't even see that they threw up on me already.

826
01:13:54,090 --> 01:13:55,590
Risky to unseal a different path.

827
01:13:55,690 --> 01:13:56,530
Let's just unseal it.

828
01:13:57,250 --> 01:13:58,950
That's the risk I'm willing to take!

829
01:14:01,210 --> 01:14:01,810
That's right.

830
01:14:01,910 --> 01:14:02,550
No fear!

831
01:14:03,890 --> 01:14:05,050
Oh, it's just one guy anyway.

832
01:14:06,450 --> 01:14:07,010
Oh, okay.

833
01:14:07,310 --> 01:14:09,170
Yeah, no, there was no reason to do it.

834
01:14:09,510 --> 01:14:10,950
Let's get you someplace safe.

835
01:14:11,730 --> 01:14:12,070
Alright.

836
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:14,470
Alright.

837
01:14:16,990 --> 01:14:17,590
That's Psyche.

838
01:14:18,530 --> 01:14:18,590
Oh.

839
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:21,490
Almost got me there.

840
01:14:22,810 --> 01:14:24,550
Okay, I don't know if I have enough for a shop.

841
01:14:24,630 --> 01:14:25,990
Yo, Supa, they give us Super Chat.

842
01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:26,870
Thank you.

843
01:14:27,610 --> 01:14:28,050
Thank you.

844
01:14:28,650 --> 01:14:30,830
Hey, Doki's my birthday a few days ago.

845
01:14:31,170 --> 01:14:32,330
Oh, I do have just enough.

846
01:14:32,630 --> 01:14:33,050
Oh, wait.

847
01:14:33,170 --> 01:14:33,870
Which is more important?

848
01:14:34,050 --> 01:14:35,630
Poseidon or Boon or Pab?

849
01:14:36,490 --> 01:14:37,330
Poseidon or Pab?

850
01:14:37,850 --> 01:14:38,530
Which is more important?

851
01:14:40,950 --> 01:14:41,790
What's she using?

852
01:14:45,030 --> 01:14:46,810
You can get a happy birthday for my Kamiyoshi.

853
01:14:46,990 --> 01:14:48,210
Of course you can, Yatupa.

854
01:14:48,850 --> 01:14:50,590
Happy birthday to you.

855
01:14:50,970 --> 01:14:52,630
Happy birthday to you.

856
01:14:52,830 --> 01:14:54,550
Happy birthday dear Yatupa.

857
01:14:55,070 --> 01:14:56,590
Happy birthday to you.

858
01:14:56,930 --> 01:14:57,110
Yeah!

859
01:14:57,430 --> 01:14:57,930
Happy birthday!

860
01:14:59,110 --> 01:15:00,090
Where is that boon?

861
01:15:00,570 --> 01:15:01,950
Wait, this is that boon, right?

862
01:15:02,550 --> 01:15:03,410
You mean Poseidon?

863
01:15:04,670 --> 01:15:07,630
I've been calling this boon, so I'm confused now.

864
01:15:08,810 --> 01:15:10,410
Okay, Palma, Poseidon.

865
01:15:11,010 --> 01:15:12,110
Okay, Poseidon, right?

866
01:15:12,670 --> 01:15:14,330
Poseidon, okay.

867
01:15:14,650 --> 01:15:16,970
Because I've been calling this boon even though it's not a
boon.

868
01:15:16,990 --> 01:15:18,430
So I'm not confusing myself.

869
01:15:18,730 --> 01:15:20,170
I'm confusing myself now.

870
01:15:21,090 --> 01:15:24,490
Oh, get Dumpo Poseidon!

871
01:15:24,970 --> 01:15:25,550
Gamba!

872
01:15:26,510 --> 01:15:27,110
Gamba!

873
01:15:27,670 --> 01:15:27,830
Gamba!

874
01:15:31,670 --> 01:15:32,270
Dumpo!

875
01:15:32,670 --> 01:15:32,830
Gamba!

876
01:15:34,690 --> 01:15:41,790
It's the first roll you run into his surrounding foes, but
as they start to strike but bro, you can't pry me more.

877
01:15:42,050 --> 01:15:48,510
I've already yeah, let's Like, you can't prime me more.

878
01:15:48,630 --> 01:15:50,350
I'm already broken magic.

879
01:15:51,270 --> 01:15:52,230
More prime.

880
01:15:53,650 --> 01:15:54,550
Fuck it.

881
01:15:55,430 --> 01:15:56,030
Wait, what?

882
01:15:56,550 --> 01:15:57,550
I thought I got...

883
01:15:57,550 --> 01:16:00,190
Oh, I was like, I didn't get double pot.

884
01:16:00,810 --> 01:16:01,630
Yeah, I'm good, guys.

885
01:16:01,730 --> 01:16:02,570
I lied.

886
01:16:03,110 --> 01:16:03,770
Don't get Zeus.

887
01:16:04,830 --> 01:16:06,230
It wasn't double.

888
01:16:06,670 --> 01:16:07,390
Oh, no.

889
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:08,130
Not him again.

890
01:16:08,390 --> 01:16:09,670
Oh, I hate this guy.

891
01:16:10,450 --> 01:16:13,290
I don't know why, but there's just something about him that
fucks with me.

892
01:16:14,170 --> 01:16:15,170
Oh, my God.

893
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:15,970
Like, I don't know.

894
01:16:16,990 --> 01:16:21,190
There's just something about this guy that messes with me.

895
01:16:22,230 --> 01:16:25,870
Like he just... I know he's not doing anything, but he's so
intimidating.

896
01:16:28,850 --> 01:16:32,130
He's just standing there, but he's just so intimidating.

897
01:16:34,050 --> 01:16:37,250
Alright, Russian cause is surrounding first, be struck by
lightning buffs.

898
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:39,030
Your chain deals more bad.

899
01:16:39,110 --> 01:16:40,930
Oh, wait, we should get that too.

900
01:16:41,810 --> 01:16:42,770
I'm gonna do chain lightning.

901
01:16:43,550 --> 01:16:44,030
More damage.

902
01:16:44,090 --> 01:16:44,550
Oh hey!

903
01:16:45,330 --> 01:16:46,350
This should be...

904
01:16:46,990 --> 01:16:48,250
My favorite man.

905
01:16:50,470 --> 01:16:51,950
There he is.

906
01:16:52,590 --> 01:16:53,210
Nicholas Cage.

907
01:16:53,310 --> 01:16:54,310
He's centered on the self.

908
01:16:55,090 --> 01:16:59,010
Become endured somehow to the incessant singing that always
echoes through these halls.

909
01:17:00,790 --> 01:17:03,170
Speak not to me if echoes this or echoes that, okay?

910
01:17:03,630 --> 01:17:06,390
Echo meant nothing to me and somehow got the wrong idea
anyway.

911
01:17:06,730 --> 01:17:07,250
Narcissist.

912
01:17:07,410 --> 01:17:08,650
And don't you get any ideas either.

913
01:17:09,350 --> 01:17:10,710
Of course I remember his name.

914
01:17:11,610 --> 01:17:14,490
I just didn't have to say it because he's in my heart, guys.

915
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:16,710
And he's in all our hearts, guys.

916
01:17:17,830 --> 01:17:20,430
I don't have to say his name to know who he is.

917
01:17:21,810 --> 01:17:23,030
Echo meant nothing to you.

918
01:17:23,890 --> 01:17:26,410
I was talking about Skiller's song and how you've blocked it
out.

919
01:17:26,570 --> 01:17:27,210
He's my hero.

920
01:17:27,730 --> 01:17:29,550
I don't think I can't quite hear it now either.

921
01:17:30,250 --> 01:17:30,850
Oh, wait, what?

922
01:17:32,890 --> 01:17:35,090
Oh, yeah, we can't hear his song.

923
01:17:35,110 --> 01:17:37,090
I learned to block you out with this.

924
01:17:37,970 --> 01:17:38,610
With this.

925
01:17:41,370 --> 01:17:42,250
Just in 100.

926
01:17:42,630 --> 01:17:44,350
I feel like HP, right?

927
01:17:44,510 --> 01:17:45,350
Increase your limit.

928
01:17:45,410 --> 01:17:46,690
Yeah, I'm going to do...

929
01:17:47,350 --> 01:17:48,350
Kitch kill.

930
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:50,210
Health limit.

931
01:17:50,870 --> 01:17:52,050
Oh, yeah, one more!

932
01:17:54,710 --> 01:17:56,710
I strive to be just like him.

933
01:17:56,810 --> 01:17:57,570
He's my hero.

934
01:17:59,790 --> 01:18:00,150
Love yourself.

935
01:18:00,270 --> 01:18:01,550
You know what they say, guys?

936
01:18:01,850 --> 01:18:02,810
Love yourself.

937
01:18:03,930 --> 01:18:05,250

01:18:07,390 --> 01:18:08,250
Oh, my God.

01:18:08,370 --> 01:18:10,570
What the fuck was that range?

940
01:18:11,110 --> 01:18:13,130
Okay, I did not expect that fucking range.

941
01:18:13,170 --> 01:18:15,030

Because she's the easiest.

1026
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:13,500
We'll get rid of drums last.

1027
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:16,340
Oh, fuck.

1028
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:16,800
It's okay.

1029
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:17,300
It's only three.

1030
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:18,120
You know, I can...

1031
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:18,660
You know, fuck it.

1032
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:19,820

01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:26,260
Wait, I can?

1036
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:28,400
Unless...

1037
01:23:30,980 --> 01:23:33,320
It's like, bro, I barely keep up to date on Twitter.

1038
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:34,000
I don't care.

1039

01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:37,340

1041
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:40,240
If they have Twitter, I'll be there spamming that shit.

1042
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:43,380
Unless they have a Twitter.

1043
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:44,420

The Hater Grind mindset.

I'm creating 20 bot accounts.

1051
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:16,480
And every time you ban one, another bot is created.

1052
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:21,420
I'm the world's strongest hater.

1053
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:23,840

Wait, let's see if there's anything downstairs.

Oh my god, I haven't seen those numbers in so long.

That's crazy.

1092
01:27:14,340 --> 01:27:17,040
The money is actually blocking...

1093
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:18,080
Blocking his death.

1094
01:27:19,900 --> 01:27:20,420
Uh...

1095
01:27:20,420 --> 01:27:21,840

01:27:28,540 --> 01:27:29,080
Poseidon or...

1099
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:30,800
We don't really have any Demeters.

1100
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:31,640

1101
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:32,200

Okay.

1106
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:40,280
I hate these guys so much.

1107
01:27:40,860 --> 01:27:42,720
To get rid of her kids first.

1108
01:27:44,340 --> 01:27:45,440
Their kids out of here.

1109
01:27:48,340 --> 01:27:48,860
Oh my god.

1110
01:27:48,980 --> 01:27:49,200
It's okay.

1111
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:49,740
It's just three.

1112
01:27:50,620 --> 01:27:51,080
Oh god.

1113
01:27:51,220 --> 01:27:51,500
That's okay.

1114
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:54,120
Get rid of the child.

1115
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:57,080
There you go.

1116
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,460
Just kill all your kids before I kill you.

1117
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:03,580
So then you have to live with the fact that your children
are dead.

1118
01:28:06,340 --> 01:28:08,340
Killed all your kids, woman!

1119
01:28:10,380 --> 01:28:12,760
All your kids are dead now!

1120
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:15,160
You outlived your child!

1121
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,700
That's the worst, too.

1122
01:28:20,340 --> 01:28:21,700
Outliving your children?

1123
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:22,960
That's right!

1124
01:28:23,260 --> 01:28:24,000
That's me!

1125
01:28:26,820 --> 01:28:27,980
That's fucking right.

1126
01:28:28,460 --> 01:28:29,540
I'll do it again.

1127
01:28:30,220 --> 01:28:32,040
I'll wait until you have another set of kids.

1128
01:28:32,660 --> 01:28:34,220
And I'll kill them too.

1129
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:37,280
You think you could move on?

1130
01:28:37,460 --> 01:28:38,300
I'll get you.

1131
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:40,480
Oh hey, infusion.

1132
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:42,220
While you have at least six.

1133
01:28:43,460 --> 01:28:47,580
Whenever you would take at least 20 damage.

1134
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:48,600
Take less.

1135
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:51,060
I don't even have enough of this though.

1136
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:55,420
Kina Bear that stops one instance of damage.

1137
01:28:55,860 --> 01:28:57,100
Do I get two or three?

1138
01:28:59,440 --> 01:28:59,840
Two?

1139
01:29:02,540 --> 01:29:03,660
I'm at five.

1140
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:05,420
I have five right now.

1141
01:29:08,740 --> 01:29:09,280
I have five.

1142
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,500
Three of you have six water.

1143
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:13,500
Maybe I'll get another water.

1144
01:29:15,860 --> 01:29:16,960
Can you get more later?

1145
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:17,900
Okay, take three.

1146
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:19,140
Okay, I'll take three.

1147
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:21,360
Oh, hey, Echo.

1148
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:24,380
Wait, Echo's gonna be here.

1149
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:25,360
Hello, girl.

1150
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:27,640
Hey, Echo.

1151
01:29:28,580 --> 01:29:29,080
We missed you.

1152
01:29:29,380 --> 01:29:31,200
Narcissus and I were talking about you earlier.

1153
01:29:31,380 --> 01:29:32,200
Good things, of course.

1154
01:29:32,340 --> 01:29:32,760
Good things.

1155
01:29:32,980 --> 01:29:33,500
How have you been?

1156
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:34,660
How have you been?

1157
01:29:37,250 --> 01:29:37,810
Oh, you know.

1158
01:29:38,190 --> 01:29:40,130
This place sure is a change for us, the honest.

1159
01:29:40,270 --> 01:29:40,970
If you've ever been.

1160
01:29:41,850 --> 01:29:43,210
Yeah, she didn't give me an extra demeanor.

1161
01:29:43,510 --> 01:29:44,310
Is that Narcissus?

1162
01:29:46,030 --> 01:29:47,070
Is that Narcissus?

1163
01:29:47,490 --> 01:29:48,670
Yeah, fuck that, yeah.

1164
01:29:49,750 --> 01:29:52,870
I'm only saying that's to get into her good grace, guys.

1165
01:29:52,930 --> 01:29:53,630
I don't mean that.

1166
01:29:53,690 --> 01:29:54,550
I love Narcissus.

1167

I was like, wait a minute.

Oh, wait.

1179
01:31:02,570 --> 01:31:03,190
Hammer time.

01:31:05,290 --> 01:31:06,790
Okay, I just noticed that.

1181
01:31:08,170 --> 01:31:09,210
That's a lot of pluses.

1182
01:31:10,870 --> 01:31:18,590
Okay, I don't have to, I shouldn't need to, uh, let's see.

1183
01:31:19,910 --> 01:31:27,610
I don't get another Echo, so I can get through this at many,

1188
01:31:48,890 --> 01:31:49,790
Bad stuff.

1189
01:31:51,450 --> 01:31:52,630
Alright, boon time.

1190
01:31:53,850 --> 01:31:56,430
Yes, your tasks inflict freeze, repeal it.

1191
01:31:56,530 --> 01:31:57,990
Your attacks deal more damage.

1192
01:31:58,390 --> 01:31:59,310
Your surrounding flows.

1193
01:31:59,470 --> 01:32:00,030
I'll do attack.

1194
01:32:00,730 --> 01:32:02,010
Attack is always good.

1195
01:32:04,330 --> 01:32:06,470
Okay, money and then we'll get hammered last.

1196
01:32:09,210 --> 01:32:09,730
Jesus.

1197
01:32:10,090 --> 01:32:12,050
Wait, so you're not even part of this fight, bro.

1198
01:32:14,430 --> 01:32:17,370
Like, bro, nobody cares about you.

1199
01:32:18,750 --> 01:32:20,810
Nobody ever invites you to the parties.

1200
01:32:21,050 --> 01:32:23,010
You're not even part of this fight.

1201
01:32:24,750 --> 01:32:25,730
Jesus, that's so annoying.

1202
01:32:28,350 --> 01:32:29,670
Okay, this should be the last one.

1203
01:32:30,010 --> 01:32:30,170
Yeah.

1204
01:32:30,890 --> 01:32:31,950
Only to rest.

1205
01:32:33,110 --> 01:32:34,070
All right, nice.

1206
01:32:34,250 --> 01:32:34,530
Money.

1207
01:32:35,770 --> 01:32:36,010
Money.

1208
01:32:36,990 --> 01:32:37,630
All right, hammer.

1209
01:32:38,710 --> 01:32:40,010
Last one is the hammer.

1210
01:32:41,530 --> 01:32:42,050
We just need the...

1211
01:32:42,070 --> 01:32:50,050

1215
01:33:17,450 --> 01:33:19,170
Or more attack, more attack.

1216
01:33:19,310 --> 01:33:20,310
You know, fuck it, more attack.

1217
01:33:20,790 --> 01:33:21,270
Superior might.

1218
01:33:21,790 --> 01:33:23,370
More attack means die fast.

1219
01:33:26,570 --> 01:33:29,130
If they have more attack, they can die faster.

1220
01:33:30,450 --> 01:33:31,410
Think about it.

1221
01:33:33,070 --> 01:33:34,110
That was crazy.

1222
01:33:34,790 --> 01:33:36,810
The math, it just adds up, you know?

01:33:39,190 --> 01:33:56,980

Yeah.

1227
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:18,440
And then we'll grab this.

1228
01:34:19,680 --> 01:34:21,700
Your chain lightning when you reclaim.

1229
01:34:21,820 --> 01:34:22,440
Oh, Gamba.

1230
01:34:23,540 --> 01:34:24,400
Grab the Gamba.

1231
01:34:25,580 --> 01:34:26,320
And then the armor.

1232
01:34:27,700 --> 01:34:28,660
That should be good.

1233
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:30,880
Alright, let's go.

1234
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:32,800
Two for more Gamba.

1235
01:34:32,900 --> 01:34:34,340
The Gamba will work eventually.

1236
01:34:34,660 --> 01:34:36,200
Been rolling around in miasma, have you?

1237
01:34:37,820 --> 01:34:40,220

Okay, it's okay.

1246
01:35:54,690 --> 01:35:55,550
Explode some!

1247
01:35:55,650 --> 01:35:57,550
Okay, I should be safe from this.

1248
01:35:57,890 --> 01:35:59,850
Yeah, my tiny little hole, my safe hole.

1249
01:36:00,790 --> 01:36:01,770
Oh my god, okay.

1250
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:06,360
It's fine.

1251
01:36:06,780 --> 01:36:07,920
He's almost dead anyway.

1252
01:36:08,900 --> 01:36:09,260
Moonbeam!

1253
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:10,920
Oh my god, I can't moonbeam.

1254
01:36:12,700 --> 01:36:14,480
He would not let me moonbeam.

1255
01:36:15,220 --> 01:36:16,360
He's like, no touchy.

1256
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:19,800
Yeah, the little saver.

1257
01:36:22,180 --> 01:36:22,980
Don't worry.

1258
01:36:23,380 --> 01:36:24,600
He's a good boy again.

1259
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:28,640
Descends again into the comfort of his pit.

1260
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:31,200
Alright, I fixed him.

1261
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:32,820
I took him to the van.

1262
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:33,600
Got him fixed.

1263
01:36:34,620 --> 01:36:36,060
No kids for him.

1264
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:38,100
Yeah.

1265
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:39,220
For now.

1266
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:42,180
Oh my god, that took up half my HP.

1267
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:42,980
That's like insane.

1268
01:36:45,180 --> 01:36:46,020
Alright, down I go.

1269
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:47,960
Oh, I didn't see the little shiny thing.

1270
01:36:48,060 --> 01:36:49,200
It's such a tiny dot.

1271
01:36:50,340 --> 01:36:51,640
Fucking tiny ass dark.

1272
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:52,960
He doesn't even see it.

1273
01:36:53,660 --> 01:36:54,620
So hard to tell.

1274
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:58,020
Alright, we're gonna grab the tooth.

1275
01:37:00,140 --> 01:37:01,100
And then...

1276
01:37:01,100 --> 01:37:02,920
I still can't access this yet.

1277
01:37:04,780 --> 01:37:05,400
Is that what you...

1278
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:07,320
Yes, Dad doesn't have balls.

1279
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:09,540
You guys should know that by now.

1280
01:37:11,420 --> 01:37:11,900
Receive...

1281
01:37:11,900 --> 01:37:13,160
Okay, when do we take damage?

1282
01:37:13,300 --> 01:37:13,880
Let's grab that.

1283
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:15,380
Because it's like $11 anyway.

1284
01:37:16,220 --> 01:37:16,860
So it's fine.

1285
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:18,160
And that grabs a quest too.

1286
01:37:19,020 --> 01:37:19,500
Okay.

1287
01:37:20,340 --> 01:37:34,440
going down service entrance all right nice back to beat up
my grandpa the exposed inner workings of the infamously

1288
01:37:34,440 --> 01:37:43,320
interlocking chambers of the underworld are a mass of gold
tooth wheels a never-ending cycle turning at the Titan's

1289
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:52,820
soul behest all right concentrate with all this racket
ever-shifting chambers Yay!

1290
01:37:54,420 --> 01:37:55,340
It's a lot.

1291
01:37:55,700 --> 01:37:56,340
I did it.

1292
01:37:58,140 --> 01:37:58,660
But...

1293
01:37:58,660 --> 01:38:02,080
It's predictable as the turning of the gears throughout this
place.

1294
01:38:04,300 --> 01:38:04,580
Alright.

1295
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:05,300
It's fine.

1296
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:07,080
It's pretty easy to kill.

1297
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:11,160
As long as I have ice, these guys can't do shit.

1298
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:12,940
And I gotta get rid of...

1299
01:38:12,940 --> 01:38:13,880
Gotta get out of here.

1300
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:18,780
The only ones I'm scared of is definitely the time, guys.

1301
01:38:21,460 --> 01:38:22,460
Okay, I feel like...

1302
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:25,640
like my normal attack does more damage than my moon beam.

1303
01:38:26,660 --> 01:38:27,300
I don't know.

1304
01:38:27,540 --> 01:38:28,400
I think I...

1305
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:35,640
My beam is like so fucking... My moon beam in general is so
fucking weak as hell.

1306
01:38:36,580 --> 01:38:37,900
Because I did too much attack.

1307
01:38:39,060 --> 01:38:42,060
I boosted my regular attack so fucking much.

1308
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:43,820
Oh no, not this.

1309
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:47,300
I'm pretty sure.

1310
01:38:49,480 --> 01:38:51,400
I'm gonna make sure get this guy out of it.

1311
01:38:51,820 --> 01:38:53,640
Yeah, it's not Upgraded at all.

1312
01:38:53,820 --> 01:38:55,560
I haven't had a chance to upgrade it.

1313
01:38:56,440 --> 01:38:58,350
I never bumped into anyone to upgrade this

1314
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:06,960
Okay, oh dad hey dad my other dad Greetings father.

1315
01:39:07,340 --> 01:39:09,580
Well, when will Cerberus let me pet him?

1316
01:39:10,780 --> 01:39:15,760
It's like a little tickle beam Quickly now tell me about
this Have you been?

1317
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:17,640
Are you well?

1318
01:39:18,280 --> 01:39:18,960
I'm doing good.

1319
01:39:19,020 --> 01:39:27,520
I lost my arm But everything is cool All my life I didn't
have a childhood because you guys got kidnapped That's

1320
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:30,040
alright Well, I'll have a childhood later, right?

1321
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:39,560
So, I'll have to get back to you Depending on how it goes
It's cool, I didn't need a childhood I'm sorry Got to clean

1322
01:39:39,560 --> 01:39:41,240
up your mess, but it's cool

1323
01:39:44,300 --> 01:39:54,320
He's saying cool But I think it's not cool But this is all
that I can do for now But being locked up hearts for 1%

1324
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:59,000
damage until you reach the limit and your Kronos take a
burst of damage.

1325
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:01,300
Your dash strikes 1 or 3?

1326
01:40:03,580 --> 01:40:04,100
What?

1327
01:40:07,640 --> 01:40:13,080
I mean it's 30% oh, 30% attack and special damage.

1328
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:14,480
It should be 1, right?

1329
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:17,420
2 or 3 for the prophecy?

1330
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:19,160
Does prophecy really matter?

1331
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:25,660
They just give me like $5 and said have a good day and you
can buy like go buy ourselves a burger king meal from that

1332
01:40:32,900 --> 01:40:47,620
are you guys sure like five dollars is five dollars yeah
keep the change they don't give me anything to be fair two

1333
01:40:47,620 --> 01:40:53,900
i'll find i'll do three five he still doesn't want to give
me a pet.

1334
01:40:54,340 --> 01:40:55,060
Bad dog!

1335
01:40:55,660 --> 01:40:56,860
Can't believe it.

1336
01:40:57,300 --> 01:40:57,920
I understand.

1337
01:40:59,100 --> 01:41:02,420
Why does he not want to let me... Oh my god!

1338
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:04,480
What the...

1339
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:06,040
All guns.

1340
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:08,120
Just all guns.

1341
01:41:10,280 --> 01:41:12,260
What the fuck was that?

1342
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:15,320
Okay.

1343
01:41:15,700 --> 01:41:16,200
Whoa.

1344
01:41:17,860 --> 01:41:19,820
I don't know how I survived that.

1345
01:41:19,980 --> 01:41:20,840
That show is crazy.

1346
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:22,320
Literally just...

1347
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:23,500
How many guns do you want?

1348
01:41:27,300 --> 01:41:27,780
Alright.

1349
01:41:31,080 --> 01:41:31,500
Bye.

1350
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:34,600
Okay, I'll get rid of.

1351
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:36,800
Take away his armor first.

1352
01:41:41,380 --> 01:41:43,460
Okay, I'm a little bit afraid of gun, man.

1353
01:41:44,940 --> 01:41:46,380
Gun man, not...

1354
01:41:46,380 --> 01:41:48,140
Gun man does not make me feel joy.

1355
01:41:48,860 --> 01:41:50,100
Are you fucking kidding me?

1356
01:41:50,260 --> 01:41:50,960
Okay, that's it.

1357
01:41:51,060 --> 01:41:51,480
Beam time.

1358
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:52,400
Moon beam time.

1359
01:41:53,220 --> 01:41:54,380
My weak-ass tickle beam.

1360
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:03,900
Sickle bean time Alright, nice Updated What did it give me?

1361
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:13,020
Oh, the crawler I was hoping I would get another power up
area I guess not Fuck me, oh god Yeah, no, yeah, no, I don't

1362
01:42:13,020 --> 01:42:14,340

1363
01:42:17,860 --> 01:42:28,860
Absolutely Yeah, no, just pure death That's fine Okay, I
want to get rid of guns Gun is the scariest The scariest one

1364
01:42:28,860 --> 01:42:33,280
Because gun moves really fast The bag gun

1365
01:42:36,630 --> 01:42:50,130
Okay I can freeze this though Yay Oh shit Pickle beam I will
grab this Oh I was hoping I find some more Money farmers but

1366
01:42:50,130 --> 01:42:57,970
I guess we go straight in Oh I'm Oh Oh, I'm so broke.

1367
01:42:58,410 --> 01:43:00,490
Oh, I could grab armor and Poseidon.

1368
01:43:00,850 --> 01:43:02,070
I guess we'll go with that.

1369
01:43:04,390 --> 01:43:06,470
Oh, when you sprint, you hit the first foe.

1370
01:43:06,590 --> 01:43:08,850
You run into a blast that knocks foes away.

1371
01:43:09,350 --> 01:43:11,910
Your cask gains power and knocks foes away.

1372
01:43:12,050 --> 01:43:13,370
Your move also launches.

1373
01:43:14,270 --> 01:43:17,230
Yeah, but I don't...

1374
01:43:17,230 --> 01:43:18,050
I guess one?

1375
01:43:18,270 --> 01:43:19,510
Because I don't use magic.

1376
01:43:20,570 --> 01:43:20,850
Yeah.

1377
01:43:21,310 --> 01:43:22,230
The will of water.

1378
01:43:23,210 --> 01:43:25,390
Oh, none of the Gamba worked.

1379
01:43:26,490 --> 01:43:28,590
Oh my god, look, look at my water.

1380
01:43:29,210 --> 01:43:29,270
Wee!

1381
01:43:29,650 --> 01:43:31,270
I'm spitting water out.

1382
01:43:31,610 --> 01:43:32,390
One way in.

1383
01:43:33,390 --> 01:43:34,610
Alright, grandpa time.

1384
01:43:35,550 --> 01:43:37,170
Got another grandpa killed in here.

1385
01:43:38,330 --> 01:43:38,890
I'm home.

1386
01:43:41,320 --> 01:43:42,220
Come closer.

1387
01:43:44,520 --> 01:43:48,480
Aides used some of his failing strength to spur you on.

1388
01:43:49,160 --> 01:43:52,120
Even whilst bound in chains, no god can break.

1389
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:54,920
Your father yet proves to be a pest.

1390
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:56,400
Yeah, but he's your son.

1391
01:43:56,540 --> 01:43:57,680
You raised him like that.

1392
01:43:57,740 --> 01:43:58,460
That's on you.

1393
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,760
That means you're a fad.

1394
01:44:04,020 --> 01:44:05,640
I mean, he is definitely a very bad father.

1395
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:09,420
He didn't finish the job.

1396
01:44:09,660 --> 01:44:11,880
The thing is, my girl, I can have both.

1397
01:44:12,640 --> 01:44:17,240
You should have seen the cruel, inventive ways your father
tortured mortal souls.

1398
01:44:18,260 --> 01:44:20,960
Thus, I dispense a form of justice to him.

1399
01:44:21,780 --> 01:44:25,260
Yeah, but, like, those souls were bad people, though.

1400
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:27,420
So they deserve this.

1401
01:44:28,600 --> 01:44:31,680
Is it really bad if I torture bad people?

1402
01:44:37,850 --> 01:44:38,750
Oh shit, nice.

1403
01:44:40,710 --> 01:44:46,310
Oh fuck, okay, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

1404
01:44:46,910 --> 01:44:49,530
Oh god, oh my god, that was scary.

1405
01:44:50,070 --> 01:44:52,810
Oh no, not Toho, not Toho, not Toho, not Toho, no Toho.

1406
01:44:54,790 --> 01:44:55,450
It's fine.

1407
01:44:56,470 --> 01:44:57,030
We're okay.

1408
01:44:59,430 --> 01:45:00,430
It's okay, we're still here.

1409
01:45:00,450 --> 01:45:13,450

01:45:32,010 --> 01:45:33,090
Nice, it's okay.

1413
01:45:33,990 --> 01:45:35,730
No moon beam for you.

1414
01:45:37,970 --> 01:45:39,210
Oh, ho ho ho ho.

1415
01:45:39,970 --> 01:45:40,310
Okay.

1416
01:45:41,670 --> 01:45:42,730
I got him.

1417
01:45:42,830 --> 01:45:43,310
Don't.

1418
01:45:43,950 --> 01:45:44,250
Maybe.

1419
01:45:45,190 --> 01:45:47,050
Maybe I don't got him.

1420
01:45:47,450 --> 01:45:48,270
Oh, shit!

1421
01:45:48,530 --> 01:45:49,030
I did not get him.

1422
01:45:49,410 --> 01:45:50,470
I did not get him.

1423
01:45:52,550 --> 01:45:54,350
Oh my god, I forgot this move.

1424
01:45:58,310 --> 01:46:00,530
Oh my god, I keep forgetting his...

1425
01:46:00,530 --> 01:46:00,690

01:46:00,790 --> 01:46:01,790
I'm taking everything.

1427
01:46:01,910 --> 01:46:05,430
It's okay, I'm such a... I'm a goddamn tank, so it doesn't
matter.

1428
01:46:08,910 --> 01:46:10,830
I'm a tank anyway.

1429
01:46:14,390 --> 01:46:15,410
Yeah, that's me.

1430
01:46:16,850 --> 01:46:18,650
Two, one.

1431
01:46:20,270 --> 01:46:22,570
It's okay, I'm also a tank.

1432
01:46:25,230 --> 01:46:25,610
Goodness.

1433
01:46:27,650 --> 01:46:29,490
Oh, fuck, I keep...

1434
01:46:29,490 --> 01:46:31,370

This is not fair What the fuck am I supposed to kill that?

01:47:15,670 --> 01:47:16,170
It's okay.

1441
01:47:19,110 --> 01:47:19,870
It's okay.

1442
01:47:22,090 --> 01:47:22,590
Alright.

1443
01:47:23,190 --> 01:47:24,190

1444
01:47:26,890 --> 01:47:27,310
Alright.

1445

Oh no.

1446
01:47:30,050 --> 01:47:31,170

Guys, it's okay.

I have two death defiance.

1451
01:47:49,820 --> 01:47:52,100
I'm only pretending to get hit.

1452
01:47:56,980 --> 01:47:59,020
Yeah, plus one!

1453
01:48:06,530 --> 01:48:09,560
Yeah, I'm creating tension in an artificial way.

1454
01:48:14,310 --> 01:48:16,310
Don't need no death defiance.

1455
01:48:16,650 --> 01:48:17,150
Let's go!

1456
01:48:18,230 --> 01:48:25,750
22 minutes is that my fastest run i don't even know this one
was me like being confused too because i don't remember how

1457
01:48:25,750 --> 01:48:38,390
to play i don't even know what my record is all right no i
can't just put him in my pocket vanquished only for the

1458
01:48:38,390 --> 01:48:47,690
moment scheming chronos cannot be so easily destroyed yet in
her every fleeting victory against him fear this one was 22

1459
01:48:47,690 --> 01:49:00,710
minutes something she thought lost i still remember flashes
of this place yeah no i got a good-eyed spiel for this all

1460
01:49:00,710 --> 01:49:09,030
right all right time to talk to my brother again see if you
got anything done impressive you won that while holding a

1461
01:49:09,030 --> 01:49:14,050
cell phone of the captive underworld prince.

1462
01:49:15,190 --> 01:49:16,670
An ordinary mirror.

1463
01:49:17,050 --> 01:49:17,410
Nothing more.

1464
01:49:20,070 --> 01:49:21,630
To the abyss of the subconscious.

1465
01:49:21,830 --> 01:49:22,530
Down I go.

1466
01:49:25,590 --> 01:49:26,550
I'm gonna eat my bagel.

1467
01:49:28,250 --> 01:49:28,770
It worked.

1468
01:49:29,890 --> 01:49:30,550
Oh, wait, shit.

1469
01:49:30,710 --> 01:49:31,630
I forgot the move.

1470
01:49:33,730 --> 01:49:36,250
I thought that would be autopilot.

1471
01:49:39,290 --> 01:49:40,730
I forgot.

1472
01:49:42,550 --> 01:49:44,310
There's no autopilot for this.

1473
01:49:44,950 --> 01:49:47,530
I can only have autopilot when I start talking to them.

1474
01:49:49,070 --> 01:49:50,810
She looks a bit like mother, doesn't she?

1475
01:49:51,290 --> 01:49:52,650
Which means...

1476
01:49:52,650 --> 01:49:53,490
Oh, blast.

1477
01:49:53,890 --> 01:49:55,150
I never thought...

1478
01:49:55,150 --> 01:49:56,250
I look just like him, then.

1479
01:49:57,070 --> 01:49:57,790
Yeah, that's right.

1480
01:49:57,830 --> 01:49:59,290
I got mom's good looks.

1481
01:50:00,510 --> 01:50:01,170
Hi there, Malinui.

1482
01:50:01,710 --> 01:50:04,070
My investigation into our grandfather's scheme has begun.

1483
01:50:04,210 --> 01:50:07,190
Though difficult to make good progress without telling
anybody what I'm up to.

1484
01:50:07,890 --> 01:50:11,170
Don't take this the wrong way, but this truly is your only
idea.

1485
01:50:13,450 --> 01:50:20,070
Yes, I don't think I can stop Kronos here even Olympus is
stuck trying to keep your whole life and you're just fucking

1486
01:50:20,070 --> 01:50:24,390
parted off your brother What fucking plan is that?

1487
01:50:28,050 --> 01:50:35,470
That's the one thing I'm like this is a shitty plan She grew
up she trained her whole life just to be like you handle it

1488
01:50:35,990 --> 01:50:42,530
That's our family for you father certainly has no love for
Kronos, but he never speaks of him I happen to know what

1489
01:50:42,530 --> 01:50:44,890
went over between them to have made things this bad.

1490
01:50:47,970 --> 01:50:50,550
You're in a better position to ask our father about that
than I am.

1491
01:50:51,590 --> 01:50:53,570
Kronos was a tyrant and his children wouldn't have it.

1492
01:50:54,050 --> 01:50:56,250
The Fates themselves deemed that the gods should rule.

1493
01:50:56,950 --> 01:50:58,690
But that apparently wasn't enough for him.

1494
01:50:59,770 --> 01:51:01,250
Oh, that's why he's punishing the Fates.

1495
01:51:01,550 --> 01:51:02,830
She's like, how dare you?

1496
01:51:03,310 --> 01:51:04,490
So now you want me to stop.

1497
01:51:06,830 --> 01:51:11,250
I've had mixed experiences vanquishing certain members of
our family before, but that wasn't forever.

1498
01:51:11,930 --> 01:51:13,690
And you've said next to nothing about how you expect.

1499
01:51:13,710 --> 01:51:23,140
me to do it look i have knowledge of an incantation known as
dissolution of time it requires several complicated steps i

1500
01:51:23,140 --> 01:51:27,000
shall explain along the way if it works it should unravel
him

1501
01:51:30,460 --> 01:51:39,060
unravel him that's a little vague for me unless kronos turns
out to be a spool of yarn can you be more specific unmake

1502
01:51:39,060 --> 01:51:45,480
him destroy his ambitions along with him undo all the harm
he caused a Three-fold family bond is required.

1503
01:51:45,780 --> 01:51:47,020
You, me, and Kronos.

1504
01:51:47,660 --> 01:51:50,680
Then we shall infuse a special weapon with an emotion of his
own being.

1505
01:51:50,700 --> 01:51:52,940
Okay, so the magic spell requires him.

1506
01:51:55,480 --> 01:51:56,140
That's right.

1507
01:51:56,240 --> 01:51:57,120
What about your dad?

1508
01:51:57,300 --> 01:51:58,560
I mean, your dad is still here.

1509
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:01,200
Why does that have to be like...

1510
01:52:01,200 --> 01:52:04,000
Okay, oh, and then we infuse it with a special weapon.

1511
01:52:04,120 --> 01:52:07,240
But it's a weapon for my brother or like for me?

1512
01:52:07,700 --> 01:52:09,500
Because we could just get my dad in here.

1513
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:10,680
Our dad.

1514
01:52:10,680 --> 01:52:15,340
though i'll admit i don't like having to kill our family
members just because father doesn't know how to get along

1515
01:52:15,340 --> 01:52:24,060
with them yeah like does it have to be me does it have to be
like who has the weapon why can't i turn my dad into the

1516
01:52:24,060 --> 01:52:32,060
weapon the last kronos is starting to revive i have to go
because my dad is related and remember this is for all of us

1517
01:52:32,060 --> 01:52:40,460
i will and i understand i think we didn't ask to be born
into this but it's what we got we'll handle it as best we

1518
01:52:40,460 --> 01:52:42,920
can Let's break the chains for it.

1519
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:43,560
That's right.

1520
01:52:44,040 --> 01:52:44,420
Thank you, brother.

1521
01:52:44,720 --> 01:52:45,520
Take care of yourself.

1522
01:52:46,200 --> 01:52:49,260
And be kind to mother, father, Cerberus, and all for me.

1523
01:52:50,120 --> 01:52:51,420
Hades isn't strong enough.

1524
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:53,820
Bro, Hades is like a fucking god.

1525
01:52:54,840 --> 01:52:58,020
We're half, we're like, and we're gods too, I guess.

1526
01:52:58,260 --> 01:52:58,800
But still.

1527
01:53:00,580 --> 01:53:01,820
To hell and back.

1528
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:03,220
The heavens next.

1529
01:53:03,380 --> 01:53:04,240
We did it.

1530
01:53:06,440 --> 01:53:07,800
Can you believe it, little one?

1531
01:53:08,100 --> 01:53:08,920
I did it.

1532
01:53:09,060 --> 01:53:09,740
I got him.

1533
01:53:10,060 --> 01:53:10,540
Again.

1534
01:53:11,540 --> 01:53:13,840
Yeah, I mean, I guess he is out of shape.

1535
01:53:15,380 --> 01:53:16,560
Oh, hey, she's here.

1536
01:53:17,480 --> 01:53:18,640
Oh, hello there, my friend.

1537
01:53:19,160 --> 01:53:22,660
I happen to see the boatman sculling down the Kakaitas,
presumably to you.

1538
01:53:22,940 --> 01:53:24,880
For he had all sorts of supplies.

1539
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:27,560
He was generous enough to offer me passage.

1540
01:53:28,080 --> 01:53:29,120
Whether he knew it or not.

1541
01:53:29,200 --> 01:53:29,620
Oh, yeah.

1542
01:53:30,220 --> 01:53:31,520
Hades fell off, guys.

1543
01:53:31,780 --> 01:53:32,180
That sucks.

1544
01:53:32,260 --> 01:53:32,740
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

1545
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:34,180
I should eat my antibiotics now.

1546
01:53:34,980 --> 01:53:36,300
That's why I didn't eat it yet.

1547
01:53:36,680 --> 01:53:37,680
Because I didn't...

1548
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:49,800

to make your stay with us more comfortable i would

1550
01:53:57,200 --> 01:54:04,660
technically don't need to take pillion killers but just to
be safe especially since the boatman is my ticket home i'll

1551
01:54:04,660 --> 01:54:10,880
just make certain all my silk here is patched up and then be
on my way be well won't you she has pretty privilege not

faded list says as little of your future is necessary I

prophecy that I would pass it on to you then that's a

companion shall listen oh she's singing hey the sonorous

1557

ray of moonlight Sturring the eternal souls of shades that

01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:28,360
Okay, I was thinking like if it has the thing where if I tab
out like the music would still play But they don't have that

1561
01:55:28,360 --> 01:55:29,100
option.

1562
01:55:29,860 --> 01:55:33,620
Ah, that sucks That's just it.

1563
01:55:33,740 --> 01:55:43,380
This is why they didn't win our game of thee don't forget
what we decided here is that borderless i thought i was

It's about the May Cafe stuff.

1571
01:56:48,370 --> 01:56:49,710
They're like, remember to do this.

1572
01:56:49,790 --> 01:56:50,890
You remember to do that.

1573
01:56:51,050 --> 01:56:53,610
And I'm like, I guess.

1574
01:56:56,530 --> 01:56:57,690
I guess.

1575
01:56:58,310 --> 01:56:59,770
I guess I'll remember.

1576
01:57:05,590 --> 01:57:07,590
Oh, yeah.

1577
01:57:07,830 --> 01:57:09,510
So, we just found out.

1578
01:57:09,870 --> 01:57:19,630
If you are, if you are coming to the maid cafe thing, you're
coming to the maid cafe today and tomorrow, men and I are

1579
01:57:19,630 --> 01:57:22,970
both singing different songs for both days.

1580
01:57:23,090 --> 01:57:25,690
So there's like, if you come on Friday, it tastes Friday,
right?

1581
01:57:25,930 --> 01:57:27,470
Friday, we're gonna sing in two songs.

1582
01:57:27,570 --> 01:57:28,950
Like we have two songs each.

1583
01:57:29,430 --> 01:57:33,110
And then Saturday, it'll be a different song from what we
chose on Friday.

1584
01:57:33,870 --> 01:57:41,770
So y'all get a unique experience because we're like asking
about, We were asking about if we could sing different songs

1585
01:57:41,770 --> 01:57:51,110
instead of like what we assigned Like earlier and they're
like, yeah, you can sing a different song But all right Join

take shelter

1591
01:59:22,630 --> 01:59:49,770
in the one sheltered by the dark the silver sister's way
marks her passage silently watching with the eye of night

1592
01:59:49,770 --> 01:59:56,590
above us all hiding in plain

1593
02:01:04,190 --> 02:01:05,230
I'm back.

1594
02:01:05,770 --> 02:01:06,730
Oh, yes, right.

1595
02:01:06,930 --> 02:01:07,270
I'm back.

1596
02:01:07,450 --> 02:01:08,590
So no more singing.

1598
02:01:19,130 --> 02:01:27,670

necromantic influence getting the ability to sprint into

1599
02:01:27,670 --> 02:01:37,130

is nine i was like oh my god why do i have I realize it's
just my sanity.

1601
02:01:42,910 --> 02:01:45,350
So they contain an infernal trove.

1602
02:01:47,390 --> 02:01:48,470
I guess I'll grab that.

1603
02:01:49,350 --> 02:01:50,950
Yeah, I was going to say, I like money.

1604
02:01:51,890 --> 02:01:53,390
Oh my god, the fucking street.

1605
02:01:53,390 --> 02:02:01,730
Okay, that reminds me the Street Fighter celebrity fucking
interview thing where the guy grabbed the mic was like,

1606
02:02:01,830 --> 02:02:03,390
we're only here for the money.

1607
02:02:03,530 --> 02:02:04,790
And I'm like, okay, bro, okay.

1608
02:02:05,590 --> 02:02:07,370
I can say that because it's funny.

1609
02:02:07,710 --> 02:02:09,930
You can't say that because...

1610
02:02:11,190 --> 02:02:14,410
You can't say that because, like, who the fuck are you?

1611
02:02:14,850 --> 02:02:21,950
Like, like, who the fuck are you, bro?

1612
02:02:24,830 --> 02:02:27,510
Yeah, you can't say that because it's real.

1613
02:02:30,990 --> 02:02:33,750
You tell that they wanted to cut his mic, too, afterwards.

1614
02:02:34,150 --> 02:02:37,890
Like, they were like, you're not supposed to, that is off
script, buddy.

1615
02:02:40,130 --> 02:02:45,110
Someone, like, I'm pretty sure they're like, bro, that had
to be off script.

1616
02:02:47,410 --> 02:02:52,830
Yeah, on stage in front of a million, two million people
were watching it on YouTube and Twitch.

1617
02:02:53,650 --> 02:02:58,670
Tiny grain, a key of sorts, to the dissolution of time.

1618
02:02:59,610 --> 02:03:00,150
Do you concur?

1619
02:03:02,650 --> 02:03:03,090
I do.

1620
02:03:03,710 --> 02:03:05,790
That very incantation sprang to mind.

1621
02:03:06,490 --> 02:03:08,550
An expression of all you taught me of his weakness.

1622
02:03:08,630 --> 02:03:09,370
He's a comedian.

1623
02:03:10,130 --> 02:03:21,270
is like I think of mature 90% people that are watching this
did not know who he was so they thought it was real tis

1624
02:03:21,270 --> 02:03:29,150
merely evidence that our concerted efforts have not been in
vain you cross the underworld like I didn't know who the

1625
02:03:29,150 --> 02:03:40,210
fuck that guy was I remain in shadows but we'll get him head
mistress away the fourth time's a charm I got more psyche

1626

02:04:36,850 --> 02:04:36,990
Okay.

1635
02:04:37,670 --> 02:04:38,870
I mean, I could try a surface.

1636
02:04:39,010 --> 02:04:39,790
What do I need?

1637
02:04:39,870 --> 02:04:41,650
What materials do I need for the surface?

1638
02:04:43,290 --> 02:04:46,070
Or saw the life-draining car set brood.

1639
02:04:46,150 --> 02:04:46,970
Oh, here, this one.

1640
02:04:47,170 --> 02:04:50,370
So I need thalamus.

1641
02:04:51,150 --> 02:04:52,350
Oh, that's the one I'm growing.

1642
02:04:53,390 --> 02:04:59,130
And then two, one more moss and two nightshades.

1643
02:04:59,230 --> 02:05:00,650
Wait, I have zero nightshades.

1644
02:05:01,050 --> 02:05:02,370
I mean, I'm growing that right now.

1645
02:05:02,450 --> 02:05:03,550
I'm growing a thalamus.

1646
02:05:03,570 --> 02:05:04,190
right now.

1647
02:05:06,450 --> 02:05:07,750
Malamus is with Chaos.

1648
02:05:08,010 --> 02:05:08,850
So, like...

1649
02:05:08,850 --> 02:05:09,470
What now?

1650
02:05:10,270 --> 02:05:12,450
I could do one more...

1651
02:05:12,450 --> 02:05:16,510
I'll do one more downstairs run and then one upstairs run
for the moss.

1652
02:05:16,590 --> 02:05:17,690
Because I just need one moss.

1653
02:05:18,390 --> 02:05:18,710
Yeah.

1654
02:05:19,650 --> 02:05:21,630
I should be able to increase my grass.

1655
02:05:21,650 --> 02:05:23,230
Okay, I can do two more.

1656
02:05:23,670 --> 02:05:25,390
A 9% chance to deal...

1657
02:05:25,390 --> 02:05:25,990
Wait, what?

1658
02:05:26,390 --> 02:05:27,670
Oh, wait, I need...

1659
02:05:27,670 --> 02:05:29,070
How much psyche do I need?

1660
02:05:29,130 --> 02:05:29,930
Oh, my God.

1661
02:05:29,990 --> 02:05:31,570
Okay, I got Ordemur's psyche, guys.

1662
02:05:32,530 --> 02:05:33,010
Sorry.

1663
02:05:33,570 --> 02:05:34,850
My mind is... Oh, hey!

1664
02:05:35,430 --> 02:05:36,410
Hey, boatman!

1665
02:05:38,450 --> 02:05:41,150
You picked a fine time to make your deliveries, my lord.

1666
02:05:41,690 --> 02:05:42,990
That's Artemis singing nearby.

1667
02:05:43,510 --> 02:05:45,250
Although perhaps such music isn't your taste.

1668
02:05:45,250 --> 02:05:47,270
Yeah, he looks like a heavy metal guy.

1669
02:05:48,310 --> 02:05:50,370
All right, let's grab some psyche again.

1670
02:05:52,110 --> 02:05:52,590

Oh, we'll grab some.

02:05:59,310 --> 02:06:00,830

Oh, that's what the fabric is for.

02:07:53,790 --> 02:07:54,810
Trade for it.

1687
02:07:55,190 --> 02:07:57,330
Oh, oh my god, I could have bought more fabric.

1688

Hey, by the way, I meant to say nice going on occasion of
achieving your objective and all that.

1689
02:08:03,030 --> 02:08:07,290
Okay, so we can't afford another weapon yet because I'm
gonna get adamant, so I'm just gonna breeze through it.

1690
02:08:07,390 --> 02:08:09,710
I don't think I need, I don't think I need to do quests yet.

1691
02:08:09,970 --> 02:08:11,050
I was able to defeat him.

1692
02:08:11,190 --> 02:08:11,790
Yes, commander.

1693
02:08:12,130 --> 02:08:15,190
Yep, but my ultimate objective is far from complete.

1694
02:08:15,590 --> 02:08:22,970
i'm just gonna go through it without any of the uh any of
the restrictions soon as one's complete along comes another

You're that?

1699
02:08:54,070 --> 02:08:55,750

Well, I'm gonna grab the, I'm gonna grab the seed thing.

02:09:01,690 --> 02:09:05,450
I'll go grab the, the chrono seed, whatever, because I need
one more.

1703
02:09:05,530 --> 02:09:08,790
I need one more chrono seed, and I'll do the surface,
because surface is, like, really fast.

1704
02:09:09,350 --> 02:09:11,750
I gotta get this one over with, first.

1705
02:09:12,210 --> 02:09:14,690
I'll grab this one over with first before I go to surface.

1706
02:09:15,690 --> 02:09:16,470
Oh, hey!

1707
02:09:17,810 --> 02:09:19,290
Oh, and Kronos?

02:09:21,250 --> 02:09:22,250
Wait, have I...

1709
02:09:22,250 --> 02:09:23,950
Have I gifted HEP anything yet?

1710
02:09:24,210 --> 02:09:26,050
Watch as it must be nice flattening him.

1711
02:09:26,290 --> 02:09:29,510
Starting to wonder what's the plan here besides that.

1712
02:09:31,850 --> 02:09:33,310
Your cat tasking cause.

1713
02:09:33,470 --> 02:09:34,530
Oh, wait, I like that.

1714
02:09:35,530 --> 02:09:36,070
Which is better?

1715
02:09:36,190 --> 02:09:36,810
One or two?

1716
02:09:37,790 --> 02:09:39,890
I mean, both of them...

1717
02:09:39,890 --> 02:09:40,150
Okay.

1718
02:09:44,260 --> 02:09:45,780
Okay, I'll give HEP later.

1719
02:09:46,780 --> 02:09:47,320
I don't know.

1720
02:09:47,340 --> 02:09:48,840
I've never done one before.

1721
02:09:49,400 --> 02:09:51,320
I've done two, but I've never done one.

1722
02:09:52,760 --> 02:09:53,440
Oh shit.

1723
02:09:53,600 --> 02:09:55,420
Okay, that shit's strong.

1724
02:09:55,540 --> 02:09:58,320
I think if I do the cooldown thing, it'd be like even
stronger.

1725
02:09:59,020 --> 02:09:59,060
All right.

1726
02:10:00,500 --> 02:10:02,300
So early, early Kronos.

1727
02:10:04,600 --> 02:10:06,840
Okay, I'll give to, I'll give Kronos something.

1728
02:10:07,540 --> 02:10:12,960
If you'll permit me almighty chaos, I wish you to have this
gift of nectar in accordance with my family's custom among

1729
02:10:12,960 --> 02:10:14,060
relatives and friends.

1730
02:10:14,720 --> 02:10:16,440
None of this would have been possible if not for you.

Your specialist deal.

Toss and earn for an okay VTuber.

1741
02:11:13,620 --> 02:11:15,180
I would get a lot of gold.

1742
02:11:15,240 --> 02:11:16,480
Yeah, I was thinking about that.

1743
02:11:17,340 --> 02:11:18,980
Like, I'll get a lot of money.

1744
02:11:20,780 --> 02:11:21,220
Oh, wait.

1745
02:11:21,780 --> 02:11:22,900
I should grab this, too.

1746
02:11:23,880 --> 02:11:28,240
Within the silence of the infinite abyss, lies infinite
possibility.

1747
02:11:29,240 --> 02:11:33,580
The limitless and unseen building blocks of all that has
ever been conceived.

1748
02:11:34,300 --> 02:11:34,520
What?

1749
02:11:34,960 --> 02:11:35,920
It's really quite a lot.

1750
02:11:35,920 --> 02:11:37,200
Nice, I dug out some gold.

1751
02:11:38,740 --> 02:11:40,180

1755
02:11:44,340 --> 02:11:45,480

1763
02:13:12,750 --> 02:13:18,210
oops oops Hey, I don't suppose you happen to see a woodsy
goddess stalking through.

1764
02:13:18,910 --> 02:13:21,350
Greenish attire, wielding a bow about her height.

1765
02:13:21,670 --> 02:13:23,230
Yeah, I'm looking for my cousin.

1766
02:13:24,330 --> 02:13:25,810
I know which one you mean, my friend.

1767
02:13:26,030 --> 02:13:27,550
And I know she's been nosing about.

1768
02:13:27,990 --> 02:13:32,470
Okay, I owe you one big dinner, even though I ruined your
entire supply for the winter.

1769
02:13:33,230 --> 02:13:35,890
You know, you know, gods gotta be like gods.

1770
02:13:36,130 --> 02:13:36,550
You know, boys.

1771
02:13:37,670 --> 02:13:39,050
Boys like, gotta be like boys.

1772
02:13:39,630 --> 02:13:42,890
You make it sound as though you fear Olympus more than you
fear Kronos and so.

1773
02:13:44,650 --> 02:13:45,690
Oh, I do.

1774
02:13:46,150 --> 02:13:48,490
It's not Kronos that made me- They're not gifted already?

1775
02:13:48,770 --> 02:13:50,250
I've grown more used to it with time.

1776
02:13:51,090 --> 02:13:55,350
Now go find your woodsy goddess and be careful not to lead
her here, alright?

1777
02:13:55,930 --> 02:13:57,570
I thought I already gifted her stuff.

1778
02:13:59,030 --> 02:14:02,230
Dawn plus 20 and I mixed your cast deal 100 damage.

1779
02:14:02,650 --> 02:14:07,950
Yep, but mixed your story whenever you- Dawn, the grand
suit, whenever- Okay, yeah, I'm gonna get the fucking 100.

1780
02:14:09,830 --> 02:14:11,450
Hope I live long enough for this.

1781
02:14:12,090 --> 02:14:13,310
Am I a gift or another gift?

1782
02:14:15,730 --> 02:14:20,590
Each time I pass through Erebus, it's comforting to know I
may run into you along the way.

1783
02:14:21,250 --> 02:14:22,690
Here's something for your lovely lair.

1784
02:14:23,890 --> 02:14:25,850
Oh, why this is very sweet.

1785
02:14:26,270 --> 02:14:27,750
It should attract a host of flies.

1786
02:14:27,770 --> 02:14:29,250
See, look, I gives her a dinner.

1787
02:14:29,810 --> 02:14:31,030
Very, very much.

1788
02:14:31,350 --> 02:14:31,610
See?

1789
02:14:31,870 --> 02:14:32,990
She's fine now.

1790
02:14:33,290 --> 02:14:34,050
It's only fair.

1791
02:14:35,730 --> 02:14:36,350
Look at that.

1792
02:14:37,190 --> 02:14:38,490
I replenished her dinner.

1793
02:14:40,030 --> 02:14:41,090
It's all it took.

1794
02:14:42,330 --> 02:14:42,710
Oh, yeah.

1795
02:14:43,190 --> 02:14:44,030
Join me.

1796
02:14:44,550 --> 02:14:45,550
All right.

1797
02:14:49,650 --> 02:14:52,550
I almost almost got me there.

1798
02:14:57,110 --> 02:14:58,750
Aphrodite or shop?

1799
02:15:00,350 --> 02:15:05,770
Uh, we'll go Aphrodite and then we'll go, because there's
always a shop at the end anyway, right?

1800
02:15:10,290 --> 02:15:11,870
Oh god, it's fine.

1801
02:15:15,050 --> 02:15:16,070
Okay, wait, actually?

1802
02:15:16,350 --> 02:15:16,750
No, wait.

1803
02:15:16,910 --> 02:15:18,510
That's my entire... I forgot.

1804
02:15:18,690 --> 02:15:19,650
I have armor.

1805
02:15:20,450 --> 02:15:22,890
I forgot about my armor situation.

1806
02:15:26,110 --> 02:15:27,150
Alright, this is fine.

1807
02:15:27,830 --> 02:15:28,330
Oh, fuck.

1808
02:15:28,410 --> 02:15:28,590
It's okay.

1809
02:15:28,690 --> 02:15:29,430
I still have six armor.

1810
02:15:29,790 --> 02:15:30,510
It's okay.

1811
02:15:35,600 --> 02:15:36,500
Oh, my god.

1812
02:15:36,600 --> 02:15:37,140
Alright, goodbye.

1813
02:15:37,320 --> 02:15:37,660
It was nice.

1814
02:15:37,840 --> 02:15:39,380
You know, it was a nice run.

1815
02:15:39,580 --> 02:15:40,840
It was a nice run.

1816
02:15:41,880 --> 02:15:43,740
I had it for one location.

1817
02:15:43,920 --> 02:15:44,540
Isn't that cool?

1818
02:15:44,760 --> 02:15:46,240
Such rage must have felt.

1819
02:15:46,400 --> 02:15:53,720
to not end me as much whatever innate satisfaction there may
be in beating up that nasty old titan is there a grander

1820
02:15:53,720 --> 02:16:01,400
plan in all of this for what we're going to do let's see
your special deals more damage to nearby foes, rushing

1821
02:16:01,400 --> 02:16:09,420
damages, gain now, wait I should grab that now, grab me
three fuck it that would be tanky

1822
02:16:12,620 --> 02:16:15,080
oh hey, money money

1823
02:16:18,300 --> 02:16:19,360
All right, that's good.

1824
02:16:19,500 --> 02:16:24,820
I don't have to worry about the explosions now.

1825
02:16:30,520 --> 02:16:35,960
I think if I could set my cooldown for the attack, it would
be like, I would have like the perfect build.

1826
02:16:38,920 --> 02:16:39,540
Let's see.

1827
02:16:39,620 --> 02:16:40,700
Oh, God, collect reward.

1828
02:16:41,180 --> 02:16:42,240
God, it's just one thing.

1829
02:16:43,040 --> 02:16:45,260
Your next duration, you move down.

1830
02:16:45,460 --> 02:16:46,260
It's $10.

1831
02:16:46,680 --> 02:16:47,740
$10 is $10.

1832
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:48,400
Fuck it.

1833
02:16:49,900 --> 02:16:51,140
I'll grab it.

1834
02:16:53,200 --> 02:16:54,760
Like, I'm so fucking rich.

1835
02:16:55,080 --> 02:16:56,660
$10 is nothing right now to me.

1836
02:16:58,980 --> 02:16:59,260
In game.

1837
02:16:59,360 --> 02:16:59,740
In game.

1838
02:16:59,920 --> 02:17:00,180
In game.

1839
02:17:03,960 --> 02:17:06,260
I'm not trying to say anything here.

1840
02:17:07,860 --> 02:17:09,000
Just so you guys know.

1841
02:17:09,180 --> 02:17:09,780
Just so you guys know.

1842
02:17:10,020 --> 02:17:11,100
I'm for the people, guys.

1843
02:17:11,400 --> 02:17:12,140
I'm for the people.

1844
02:17:13,380 --> 02:17:15,180
I have to clear up.

1845
02:17:15,680 --> 02:17:16,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1846
02:17:21,360 --> 02:17:24,380
Just so you guys know, in-game.

1847
02:17:30,500 --> 02:17:31,220
Oh, shit.

1848
02:17:32,800 --> 02:17:33,320
Oh, my god.

1849
02:17:33,400 --> 02:17:35,220
Wait, there's a lot of shit going on here.

1850
02:17:38,820 --> 02:17:39,260
Nice.

1851
02:17:40,400 --> 02:17:41,020
Get in there.

1852
02:17:41,200 --> 02:17:41,740
It started!

1853
02:17:41,980 --> 02:17:42,680
Oh, shit!

1854
02:17:43,680 --> 02:17:45,380
Okay, just tank the entire missile.

1855
02:17:45,980 --> 02:17:46,200
It's okay.

1856
02:17:46,260 --> 02:17:46,620
It's only five.

1857
02:17:46,640 --> 02:17:47,440
I have damage.

1858
02:17:48,820 --> 02:17:48,920
Oh.

1859
02:17:49,540 --> 02:17:50,780
And then we dig through this.

1860
02:17:52,240 --> 02:17:54,040
And what did that give me?

1861
02:17:56,240 --> 02:17:56,940
Oh, Ash.

1862
02:18:00,580 --> 02:18:00,940
Okay.

1863
02:18:01,680 --> 02:18:02,360
Grab heart.

1864
02:18:02,700 --> 02:18:03,560
It was always good.

1865
02:18:03,940 --> 02:18:04,960
I'm so rich right now.

1866
02:18:05,040 --> 02:18:05,760
I don't really need.

1867
02:18:07,640 --> 02:18:08,160
Stop.

1868
02:18:08,980 --> 02:18:09,480
Stop.

1869
02:18:11,420 --> 02:18:13,520
I feel like I don't really need anything.

1870
02:18:15,780 --> 02:18:16,300
End game.

1871
02:18:16,400 --> 02:18:16,620
End game.

1872
02:18:16,640 --> 02:18:29,520

1873
02:18:34,580 --> 02:18:39,900

1874
02:18:43,100 --> 02:18:48,720
oh i'm gonna go for the shop it's because I just have so
much money to spend anyway.

1875
02:18:49,680 --> 02:18:50,580
Yeah, see, I knew it.

1876
02:18:54,700 --> 02:18:57,700
Keep getting shipments of those gold and Kronos coins.

1877
02:18:58,180 --> 02:19:01,440
I melt them down and dump the goop into the earth whence it
came.

1878
02:19:01,920 --> 02:19:03,600
So Kronos can make more.

1879
02:19:04,660 --> 02:19:05,980
I should really get insurance.

1880
02:19:06,120 --> 02:19:07,400
I should really get health insurance.

1881
02:19:07,620 --> 02:19:08,400
And dental insurance.

1882
02:19:08,700 --> 02:19:10,300
And all the other type of insurances.

1883
02:19:11,480 --> 02:19:12,620
Here he has deals.

1884
02:19:13,180 --> 02:19:16,220
Damage three times in successions to foes in the blinding
circle.

1885
02:19:16,640 --> 02:19:24,720
abiding circles okay um your foe is near after you can cause
a blast that deals your your weapon deals more damage based

1886
02:19:24,720 --> 02:19:35,300
on okay i don't have any of that um three is good and buy
armor but then like i need a uh you don't have any insurance

1887
02:19:35,300 --> 02:19:40,820
well the thing is i'm self-employed and by being
self-employed i have to insure myself

1888
02:19:46,340 --> 02:19:50,120
But, I don't have the armor regen, though.

1889
02:19:51,580 --> 02:19:53,940
If I lose, guys, I lose my armor really quick, though.

1890
02:19:55,200 --> 02:19:56,400
That's the only issue.

1891
02:19:57,960 --> 02:19:59,940
I lose my armor really quick.

1892
02:20:07,310 --> 02:20:11,610
I'm definitely getting dental insurance, though, after the
incident.

1893
02:20:19,940 --> 02:20:22,460
Yeah, I'm currently out of the system.

1894
02:20:22,600 --> 02:20:24,240
Out of the Canadian healthcare system.

1895
02:20:26,620 --> 02:20:28,360
Okay, I'll try, I'll try.

1896
02:20:30,020 --> 02:20:31,060
I'll try my best.

1897
02:20:31,220 --> 02:20:33,680
Oh, I only have, like, one boon I didn't realize.

1898
02:20:33,880 --> 02:20:34,660
Moros returned.

1899
02:20:35,340 --> 02:20:36,500
He's joined us at the crossroads.

1900
02:20:37,280 --> 02:20:40,400
Now we've no fewer than three mighty sons of Knicks within
our ranks.

1901
02:20:41,280 --> 02:20:42,820
Granted, one's always faster.

1902
02:20:42,820 --> 02:20:46,920
But yet, my tax is still paid for the health insurance that
I'm not allowed to get.

1903
02:20:49,100 --> 02:20:50,580
That's the crazy part.

1904
02:20:52,400 --> 02:20:55,680
I'm paid for other people's health care.

1905
02:21:01,450 --> 02:21:11,490
Here goes I gotta fix that How fast the task I've told my
brother of what Kroners has done But he expressed reluctance

1906
02:21:11,490 --> 02:21:20,110
I'm my own black company I'm canceling a company doesn't
provide Ensure health insurance or dental insurance Stokey

1907
02:21:20,110 --> 02:21:23,330
Oh my god you gotta spice to the CEO about this

1908
02:21:28,710 --> 02:21:35,110
That's crazy A complication.

1909
02:21:36,490 --> 02:21:38,110
Tokey versus Tokey.

1910
02:21:38,670 --> 02:21:39,510
Especially from your father.

1911
02:21:40,490 --> 02:21:41,790
We gotta cancel him.

1912
02:21:42,130 --> 02:21:42,630
With doubt.

1913
02:21:43,730 --> 02:21:45,330
We have no recourse here, Millennial.

1914
02:21:45,610 --> 02:21:47,270
They don't even have Tesla.

1915
02:21:47,650 --> 02:21:48,050
For naught.

1916
02:21:50,870 --> 02:21:53,590
He also asked me what exactly happened between Kronos and my
father.

1917
02:21:53,590 --> 02:21:55,570
Yeah, don't you care about Tokey's health, Tokey?

1918
02:21:56,570 --> 02:21:57,250
Does anyone?

1919
02:21:58,290 --> 02:21:59,230
This war he's waiting.

1920
02:21:59,230 --> 02:22:00,130
Don't even have to.

1921
02:22:00,150 --> 02:22:00,990
Bad insurance.

1922
02:22:04,110 --> 02:22:07,050
Why would you still work for that company, dokey?

1923
02:22:10,650 --> 02:22:12,470
Leave your own company.

1924
02:22:12,990 --> 02:22:15,310
Every choice history is of no bearing to our present state.

1925
02:22:16,130 --> 02:22:19,870
In war, one would be wise to not give undue credit to one's
enemies.

1926
02:22:20,630 --> 02:22:24,550
If you spend all your time so deep in thought, then you
shall hesitate to act.

1927
02:22:25,130 --> 02:22:26,590
And your moment shall pass.

1928
02:22:28,630 --> 02:22:30,110
Bro, you know what's even...

1929
02:22:30,150 --> 02:22:32,250
You know what's so fucked up?

1930
02:22:32,610 --> 02:22:32,710
Doki?

1931
02:22:34,750 --> 02:22:38,030
The company keeps like 100% of the profits.

1932
02:22:38,410 --> 02:22:39,310
Like that's so...

1933
02:22:41,270 --> 02:22:43,850
That is so messed up, guys.

1934
02:22:45,170 --> 02:22:52,190
The situation is crazy.

1935
02:22:57,070 --> 02:22:58,510
Okay, there you go.

1936
02:22:59,110 --> 02:23:00,570
Damn, that's the leak.

1937
02:23:01,610 --> 02:23:02,690
That's rough, bro.

1938
02:23:02,890 --> 02:23:03,330
I know.

1939
02:23:04,610 --> 02:23:05,850
So messed up.

1940
02:23:13,830 --> 02:23:14,270
Oh, my God.

1941
02:23:14,410 --> 02:23:15,350
I ran into it.

1942
02:23:15,390 --> 02:23:16,330
I was like, you didn't hit me.

1943
02:23:16,410 --> 02:23:17,450
And I felt bad.

1944
02:23:24,360 --> 02:23:25,160
There you go.

1945
02:23:34,290 --> 02:23:34,690
No.

1946
02:23:34,990 --> 02:23:35,650
Oh, my God.

1947
02:23:35,710 --> 02:23:37,290
I got hit at the last second, too.

1948
02:23:37,350 --> 02:23:38,150
That's the worst part.

1949
02:23:39,010 --> 02:23:40,050
I actually got hit on the...

1950
02:23:40,050 --> 02:23:40,950
Are you fucking...

1951
02:23:40,950 --> 02:23:41,290
Oh, kid.

1952
02:23:42,750 --> 02:23:43,150
Oh.

1953
02:23:43,590 --> 02:23:44,610
Oh, my army!

1954
02:23:45,430 --> 02:23:46,730
Ah, my army!

1955
02:23:47,490 --> 02:23:47,830
Ah!

1956
02:23:50,850 --> 02:23:52,430
Okay, we gotta get armor regen.

1957
02:23:57,860 --> 02:24:00,320
Okay, we definitely need to get armor regen here.

1958
02:24:04,880 --> 02:24:08,000
God damn, I used it on the fucking the witches.

1959
02:24:12,640 --> 02:24:12,860
Okay.

1960
02:24:16,140 --> 02:24:16,740
Okay, nice.

1961
02:24:18,680 --> 02:24:19,000
Okay.

1962
02:24:19,660 --> 02:24:20,220
There you go.

1963
02:24:22,440 --> 02:24:23,080
Oh!

1964
02:24:25,060 --> 02:24:29,060
Doki gets all the profits, but Doki just gets paid in.

1965
02:24:29,660 --> 02:24:30,100
Oh shit.

1966
02:24:31,620 --> 02:24:34,040
At least I got an achievement, yeah.

1967
02:24:34,580 --> 02:24:36,660
Yeah, but Doki got an achievement just now.

1968
02:24:37,540 --> 02:24:38,900
Yay, good stuff.

1969
02:24:40,640 --> 02:24:49,260
Beneath the outer edge of Erebus extends a hidden region of
the underworld, known only to few, and navigable only by

1970
02:24:49,260 --> 02:24:50,160
fewer still.

1971
02:24:51,480 --> 02:25:01,960
That's crazy that my grandpa said hasn't found this place

1978
02:26:03,110 --> 02:26:03,630
That's right.

1979
02:26:03,970 --> 02:26:04,890
Fight for me!

1980
02:26:06,010 --> 02:26:07,610
You're already in hell anyway.

1981
02:26:07,910 --> 02:26:08,610
You're already dead.

1982
02:26:08,810 --> 02:26:09,490
You might as well.

1983
02:26:09,670 --> 02:26:10,790
That's right, go!

1984
02:26:12,050 --> 02:26:14,670
Okay, this build, my current build really sucks right now.

1985
02:26:14,730 --> 02:26:15,410
I'm so weak.

1986
02:26:16,390 --> 02:26:18,110
I'm not really fat on my current build.

1987
02:26:23,120 --> 02:26:24,260
Yeah, we'll grab that.

1988
02:26:25,120 --> 02:26:25,840
Oh, wait, nice.

1989
02:26:26,600 --> 02:26:29,460
I just don't have, I think it's because I don't have any
boons at all.

1990
02:26:31,060 --> 02:26:32,380
That's why it sucks.

1991
02:26:35,980 --> 02:26:37,640
I don't have any really good boons.

1992
02:26:39,240 --> 02:26:41,540
Other than my hat, like the hefty sting.

1993
02:26:43,560 --> 02:26:45,140
Yeah, I'm just gonna lock you in real quick.

1994
02:26:49,870 --> 02:26:50,890
Alright, hammer time.

1995
02:26:51,810 --> 02:26:54,770
You attack does 50%.

1996
02:26:54,770 --> 02:26:56,110
Oh, wait.

1997
02:26:57,850 --> 02:27:01,530
Um, plus 50% damage or three?

1998
02:27:03,170 --> 02:27:03,270
Okay.

1999
02:27:04,130 --> 02:27:04,570
Two?

2000
02:27:05,730 --> 02:27:06,430
It also does.

2001
02:27:06,650 --> 02:27:07,310
But it's hold.

2002
02:27:07,530 --> 02:27:08,310
Oh, but it's hold.

2003
02:27:08,970 --> 02:27:09,910
Yeah, but I don't hold.

2004
02:27:10,190 --> 02:27:11,270
I'm going to do plus third.

2005
02:27:11,310 --> 02:27:12,330
I just realized it's cast.

2006
02:27:14,070 --> 02:27:14,450
Yeah.

2007
02:27:14,770 --> 02:27:16,450
I don't cast it.

2008
02:27:18,170 --> 02:27:19,130
I'm going to do three.

2009
02:27:19,910 --> 02:27:20,490
I barely.

2010
02:27:20,610 --> 02:27:21,810
I barely cast it.

2011
02:27:22,130 --> 02:27:23,030
My silver shines.

2012
02:27:23,330 --> 02:27:23,970
I just go.

2013
02:27:24,250 --> 02:27:25,450
I just go pop, pop, pop.

2014
02:27:29,280 --> 02:27:30,360
I don't hold it.

2015
02:27:30,440 --> 02:27:31,340
I barely hold it.

2016
02:27:31,600 --> 02:27:32,380
Oh, mighty chaos.

2017
02:27:35,040 --> 02:27:36,560
Oh, he doesn't want to talk to me anymore.

2018
02:27:37,220 --> 02:27:40,180
5.1 for your actors, you use 50%.

2019
02:27:40,180 --> 02:27:42,360
You have not clearing two out count for you.

2020
02:27:42,480 --> 02:27:48,700
You have 75% chance to find 100% resources with your
gathering tools for the next encounter.

2021
02:27:49,720 --> 02:27:50,040
4.

2022
02:27:50,140 --> 02:27:53,620
You should send 3?

2023
02:27:54,540 --> 02:27:56,520
You say I can beat it in time?

2024
02:27:57,860 --> 02:27:58,340
I'll try.

2025
02:27:58,880 --> 02:27:59,880
Okay, I'm actually...

2026
02:28:00,760 --> 02:28:02,520
Okay, we'll grab this real fast.

2027
02:28:02,720 --> 02:28:04,620
Oh my god, it's a boss fight.

02:28:59,880 --> 02:29:08,760
He's so scary to be the rat not like any of the rest of us
were able to as you can plainly see he is the hardest boss

2034
02:29:08,760 --> 02:29:21,440
he's so tiny and does so much okay your sprint leaves when
your attack or special deal damage restore oh magic okay we

2036
02:29:29,040 --> 02:29:34,300
i'm gonna do snuff candle for the boss oh oh okay Oh, okay.

2037
02:29:34,540 --> 02:29:35,180

2038
02:29:35,180 --> 02:29:35,940
Oh, okay.

2039
02:29:36,560 --> 02:29:38,760
I didn't have a choice, but I'll take it.

2040
02:29:41,980 --> 02:29:42,340
Yay!

2041
02:29:42,660 --> 02:29:43,480
I got both!

2042
02:29:45,860 --> 02:29:46,740
Jesus Christ.

2043
02:29:46,880 --> 02:29:47,940
Okay, that's a lot of...

2044
02:29:47,940 --> 02:29:49,080
That's a lot of damage.

2045
02:29:49,580 --> 02:29:51,140
I don't even know what's going on anymore.

2046
02:29:51,720 --> 02:29:52,840
I don't even...

2047
02:29:52,840 --> 02:29:54,040
It was just a lot of...

2048
02:29:54,040 --> 02:29:55,180
That's a lot of damage.

2049
02:29:55,700 --> 02:29:57,200
What the fuck is going on?

2050
02:30:00,900 --> 02:30:01,340
Okay.

2051
02:30:01,880 --> 02:30:02,280
Nice.

2052
02:30:03,120 --> 02:30:04,480
The foes eliminated.

2053
02:30:05,140 --> 02:30:05,580
Did I grab?

2054
02:30:06,100 --> 02:30:07,040
Did I do it?

2055
02:30:09,120 --> 02:30:11,460
The keep safe effect has spied.

2056
02:30:12,720 --> 02:30:13,060
Let's see.

2057
02:30:13,180 --> 02:30:13,760
The witch strike.

2058
02:30:14,060 --> 02:30:15,660
Any money you gain.

2059
02:30:17,480 --> 02:30:18,300
I did it, right?

2060
02:30:18,740 --> 02:30:19,220
Yeah!

2061
02:30:21,260 --> 02:30:23,460
What did I even... What did I get doubled on?

2062
02:30:23,760 --> 02:30:24,240
This one?

2063
02:30:24,920 --> 02:30:27,500
Okay, I have magic and...

2064
02:30:27,500 --> 02:30:29,600
I technically can do a magic build now.

2065
02:30:30,480 --> 02:30:31,280
I'll grab ash.

2066
02:30:32,660 --> 02:30:47,760
Okay, that's done what the fuck is she still oh my god oh my

2068
02:31:03,120 --> 02:31:05,100
There should be a...

2069
02:31:05,880 --> 02:31:07,480
No farming thing?

2070
02:31:10,970 --> 02:31:11,310
Huh?

2071
02:31:12,210 --> 02:31:13,850
There was a forget-me-not here.

2072
02:31:16,190 --> 02:31:18,230
I swear it was a forget-me-not.

2073
02:31:19,890 --> 02:31:20,610
Is that wrong?

2074
02:31:24,130 --> 02:31:25,710
We'll grab more ash.

2075
02:31:27,590 --> 02:31:28,370
Don't look down.

2076
02:31:29,510 --> 02:31:30,710
Yeah, I don't...

2077
02:31:30,710 --> 02:31:31,590
I don't know.

2078
02:31:31,930 --> 02:31:34,210
It does not feel like...

2079
02:31:34,590 --> 02:31:35,550
Oh, fuck!

2080
02:31:35,870 --> 02:31:39,130
I feel like my damage is so low, too.

2081
02:31:40,050 --> 02:31:40,890
That's the thing.

2082
02:31:44,850 --> 02:31:46,970
I feel like I'm not doing that much damage.

2083
02:31:47,310 --> 02:31:48,250
I need more boons.

2084
02:31:48,970 --> 02:31:50,630
But I'm not getting any boons.

2085
02:31:51,970 --> 02:31:52,670
At all.

2086
02:31:53,730 --> 02:31:55,530
Yeah, I'm not getting anything.

2087
02:31:57,370 --> 02:31:58,810
We'll grab this.

2088
02:32:00,650 --> 02:32:01,430
Oh, okay.

2089
02:32:01,770 --> 02:32:04,870
Well, I have enough for Hestia.

2090
02:32:06,450 --> 02:32:10,970
If your attacks end special, gain power, the more...

2091
02:32:10,970 --> 02:32:14,670
Oh, I have three right now.

2092
02:32:16,890 --> 02:32:17,910
Should I grab Infusion?

2093
02:32:19,370 --> 02:32:19,970
Or one?

2094
02:32:22,870 --> 02:32:24,790
I have three Fire Boons.

2095
02:32:25,690 --> 02:32:26,070
One?

2096
02:32:26,210 --> 02:32:26,870
One is better?

2097
02:32:32,140 --> 02:32:33,500
One for Boss.

2098
02:32:36,220 --> 02:32:38,120
Oh, I thought you said F is good.

2099
02:32:38,180 --> 02:32:39,320
You had more porn into it.

2100
02:32:39,340 --> 02:32:40,260
I'm like, excuse me?

2101
02:32:40,380 --> 02:32:47,580
But you said, um, I was like, excuse me, what did you say?

2102
02:32:50,420 --> 02:32:50,900
Whoa.

2103
02:32:51,300 --> 02:32:55,000
She would never have to give up anything to use my power,
little star.

2104
02:32:55,460 --> 02:33:01,220
But if a handful of wilds misreads, you even more reliably,
then so be it.

2105
02:33:03,620 --> 02:33:04,900
All right, let's see.

2106
02:33:05,080 --> 02:33:07,400
Your hex five is a beam that deals 500.

2107
02:33:08,120 --> 02:33:09,320
Oh, yeah, no, we'll get the healer.

2108
02:33:09,340 --> 02:33:09,620
one.

2109
02:33:10,180 --> 02:33:10,900
The heal one's always good.

2110
02:33:14,460 --> 02:33:15,420
Yay, heal time.

2111
02:33:16,140 --> 02:33:17,200
Yay, moon water.

2112
02:33:17,340 --> 02:33:19,140
Oh, wait, I can literally use it right now.

2113
02:33:19,580 --> 02:33:20,700
Yay, I'm healed.

2114
02:33:21,260 --> 02:33:22,460
My 15 HP.

2115
02:33:22,680 --> 02:33:23,220
Let's go.

2116
02:33:24,760 --> 02:33:25,140
Oh, my God.

2117
02:33:25,280 --> 02:33:25,920
Why did I forget?

2118
02:33:26,040 --> 02:33:26,740
I can't suck.

2119
02:33:28,380 --> 02:33:28,820
I forgot.

2120
02:33:29,200 --> 02:33:33,400
I was trying to get my cough drop, but then I remembered
that I'm not allowed to suck on candy.

2121
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:36,840
As me.

2122
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:37,780
Your haters back.

2123
02:33:38,440 --> 02:33:38,880
That's right.

2124
02:33:38,940 --> 02:33:41,020
I've created my 70th account.

2125
02:33:47,540 --> 02:33:48,220
That's right.

2126
02:33:48,640 --> 02:33:50,420
I'm going to cancel another concert.

2127
02:33:52,580 --> 02:33:54,620
Perhaps you shall be hunted by some other agent, though.

2128
02:33:54,960 --> 02:33:59,860
Your fans are going to make you keep providing full refunds
so you'll earn nothing.

2129
02:34:00,600 --> 02:34:01,980
The auntie is back.

2130
02:34:04,580 --> 02:34:07,960
And she's going to put in a good word for us, won't she?

2131
02:34:12,480 --> 02:34:13,360
Boom!

2132
02:34:18,170 --> 02:34:18,530
Okay.

2133
02:34:23,300 --> 02:34:24,340
All right, nice.

2134
02:34:26,240 --> 02:34:26,760
All right.

2135
02:34:28,700 --> 02:34:29,340
Boom!

2136
02:34:30,940 --> 02:34:31,660
That's right!

2137
02:34:32,300 --> 02:34:33,440
Drummer, God!

2138
02:34:33,980 --> 02:34:35,280
Get your guitarist next!

2139
02:34:38,280 --> 02:34:38,620
You know what?

2140
02:34:38,640 --> 02:34:39,080
Heal!

2141
02:34:42,440 --> 02:34:43,480
That's all right.

2142
02:34:47,600 --> 02:34:48,900
That's right, you're next!

2143
02:34:50,760 --> 02:34:51,700
Oh fuck, that's okay.

2144
02:34:52,340 --> 02:34:53,300
I already healed anyway.

2145
02:34:54,220 --> 02:34:54,880
It's okay.

2146
02:34:56,740 --> 02:34:59,460
Oh my god, I hit just in time.

2147
02:35:02,640 --> 02:35:03,500
There's the kit.

2148
02:35:07,340 --> 02:35:08,160
Oh shit!

2149
02:35:09,040 --> 02:35:10,040
Wait, that's not fair.

2150
02:35:11,640 --> 02:35:12,840
This is a three against one.

2151
02:35:13,980 --> 02:35:15,140
Sorry, I'll get rid of the drummer.

2152
02:35:15,480 --> 02:35:16,160
Drummer boy.

2153
02:35:19,750 --> 02:35:20,250
What?

2154
02:35:20,430 --> 02:35:21,430
hits me?

2155
02:35:22,050 --> 02:35:23,090
That's bullshit.

2156
02:35:24,970 --> 02:35:24,970
Boom!

2157
02:35:25,510 --> 02:35:26,270
You're gonna fuck this.

2158
02:35:26,730 --> 02:35:27,750
Getting that 15 HP.

2159
02:35:30,410 --> 02:35:31,610
I mean, he's almost dead.

2160
02:35:32,350 --> 02:35:32,650
There you go.

2161
02:35:36,810 --> 02:35:37,310
That's right.

2162
02:35:38,690 --> 02:35:39,550
And again!

2163
02:35:41,530 --> 02:35:42,410
Oh, fuck.

2164
02:35:42,670 --> 02:35:42,670
Okay.

2165
02:35:42,830 --> 02:35:43,250
It's fine.

2166
02:35:43,350 --> 02:35:44,090
I'll just burn her a little.

2167
02:35:45,150 --> 02:35:47,590
Because water's weak against fire, right?

2168
02:35:50,130 --> 02:35:51,850
Guys, that's how it goes.

2169
02:35:57,390 --> 02:35:58,530
Time to eat some clam.

2170
02:35:58,710 --> 02:35:59,750
I actually don't like clam.

2171
02:36:00,330 --> 02:36:00,850
I'm not a...

2172
02:36:00,850 --> 02:36:02,390
Oh, see, I hate it.

2173
02:36:02,450 --> 02:36:03,110
Look at that.

2174
02:36:03,370 --> 02:36:05,430
I'm justified for being an anti.

2175
02:36:10,310 --> 02:36:11,350
It's justifiable.

2176
02:36:14,170 --> 02:36:14,370
Alright.

2177
02:36:15,290 --> 02:36:16,590
Then we get the guardian.

2178
02:36:17,790 --> 02:36:20,090
And then we have a pattern going in.

2179
02:36:22,010 --> 02:36:23,550
Can I gain a random item?

2180
02:36:23,850 --> 02:36:24,650
Wait, gain plus two?

2181
02:36:24,810 --> 02:36:25,230
What's this?

2182
02:36:25,670 --> 02:36:26,310
Mystery seeds?

2183
02:36:26,430 --> 02:36:27,190
Oh, we need that.

2184
02:36:27,270 --> 02:36:28,730
I mean, we have the money for this.

2185
02:36:29,030 --> 02:36:30,030
We'll grab this and this.

2186
02:36:31,010 --> 02:36:32,170
I get Witch's Mark?

2187
02:36:32,410 --> 02:36:34,190
What the fuck is a Witch's Mark?

2188
02:36:35,930 --> 02:36:36,330
Oh!

2189
02:36:36,610 --> 02:36:37,370
My cast!

2190
02:36:37,510 --> 02:36:38,350
Oh, six encounters.

2191
02:36:38,530 --> 02:36:38,990
Never mind.

2192
02:36:41,810 --> 02:36:44,090
Doki, she's just trying to follow her dreams.

2193
02:36:44,270 --> 02:36:45,110
Stop being a hater.

2194
02:36:45,230 --> 02:36:45,750
Simple mind.

2195
02:36:45,850 --> 02:36:46,630
I think it was super chat.

2196
02:36:46,690 --> 02:36:47,390
Thank you, thank you.

2197
02:36:47,570 --> 02:36:50,030
Well, sometimes, some people's dreams don't come true.

2198
02:36:55,150 --> 02:36:57,530
You think I didn't have dreams?

2199
02:36:57,690 --> 02:37:00,500
If my dreams can't come true, her dreams can't come true.

2200
02:37:05,450 --> 02:37:07,110
That's fucking right.

2201
02:37:09,090 --> 02:37:11,170
Nobody's dreams are coming true today.

2202
02:37:12,110 --> 02:37:12,530
It's true.

2203
02:37:13,270 --> 02:37:16,170
If I can't have it, no one can.

2204
02:37:17,830 --> 02:37:19,490
I want to like...

2205
02:37:19,490 --> 02:37:20,930
What's the other item?

2206
02:37:21,270 --> 02:37:21,970
Oh, it's...

2207
02:37:21,990 --> 02:37:22,410
armor.

2208
02:37:24,310 --> 02:37:26,870
I mean, it doesn't matter here, I'm just gonna grab it just
in case.

2209
02:37:27,670 --> 02:37:29,770
Just for the sake of it.

2210
02:37:33,400 --> 02:37:34,600
That's fucking right.

2211
02:37:35,560 --> 02:37:35,960
Burn!

2212
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:45,080
Okay, so it was a POM and what else.

2213
02:37:46,880 --> 02:37:48,160
Just get these guys out.

2214
02:37:48,820 --> 02:37:49,600
POM and Moon.

2215
02:37:49,720 --> 02:37:51,780
I already have a double for POM.

2216
02:37:51,800 --> 02:37:52,380
Come on out.

2217
02:37:53,760 --> 02:37:54,300
Okay.

2218
02:37:55,340 --> 02:37:56,680
Oh, God, it's a wolf.

2219
02:37:59,940 --> 02:38:01,680
Oh, God, the wolf is scary, though.

2220
02:38:02,220 --> 02:38:03,740
I will admit, wolf is scary.

2221
02:38:04,400 --> 02:38:04,960
Wolf does a lot.

2222
02:38:05,160 --> 02:38:06,020
Oh, my God.

2223
02:38:06,220 --> 02:38:08,560
Just as I said that, he fucking jumped me.

2224
02:38:12,780 --> 02:38:13,940
All right, let's get upgrades.

2225
02:38:14,400 --> 02:38:15,320
We need this.

2226
02:38:16,260 --> 02:38:17,780
Hex restores 10.

2227
02:38:18,020 --> 02:38:18,880
There you go.

2228
02:38:20,220 --> 02:38:20,800
Oh, whoops.

2229
02:38:21,160 --> 02:38:22,480
Went into the slow accidentally.

2230
02:38:24,320 --> 02:38:25,760
Alright, yeah, it's just one left.

2231
02:38:26,880 --> 02:38:28,220
Because I got everything else already.

2232
02:38:33,420 --> 02:38:33,880
Boom!

2233
02:38:34,880 --> 02:38:35,220
Burn!

2234
02:38:38,840 --> 02:38:39,760
Okay, nice.

2235
02:38:41,200 --> 02:38:43,060
Oh, you're cast and flicked.

2236
02:38:43,120 --> 02:38:45,440
I feel like I should just put it on my strike, right?

2237
02:38:46,160 --> 02:38:49,260
Just to keep investing on the attack one.

2238
02:38:50,460 --> 02:38:51,700
I feel like...

2239
02:38:52,220 --> 02:38:53,460
Just to make it more worth it.

2240
02:38:56,160 --> 02:38:57,260
Okay, get this guy out.

2241
02:38:58,860 --> 02:38:59,560
Okay, the meter.

2242
02:39:01,240 --> 02:39:02,520
We'll grab all of this.

2243
02:39:02,620 --> 02:39:03,480
This has everything.

2244
02:39:03,620 --> 02:39:04,220
I'm sorry, the meter.

2245
02:39:04,340 --> 02:39:06,220
You have, it's just one the meter.

2246
02:39:09,520 --> 02:39:10,920
We'll go this way.

2247
02:39:15,200 --> 02:39:16,900
Okay, we'll get this guy out of here.

2248
02:39:17,460 --> 02:39:17,800
Boom!

2249
02:39:18,140 --> 02:39:19,560
Oh, that's it?

2250
02:39:21,980 --> 02:39:23,440
Hammer should be the repeat.

2251
02:39:24,120 --> 02:39:26,140
Yeah, if Hammer lasts...

2252
02:39:26,140 --> 02:39:26,340
Okay.

2253
02:39:26,360 --> 02:39:27,160
God.

2254
02:39:27,700 --> 02:39:29,260
Beat the Medusa so much.

2255
02:39:32,440 --> 02:39:33,160
Jesus!

2256
02:39:34,120 --> 02:39:34,920
Okay, it didn't hit me.

2257
02:39:35,320 --> 02:39:37,700
I dodged it because I'm just good like that.

2258
02:39:39,420 --> 02:39:40,500
Getting this.

2259
02:39:42,040 --> 02:39:42,680
Bomb time.

2260
02:39:44,740 --> 02:39:45,040
And...

2261
02:39:45,040 --> 02:39:45,300
Oh.

2262
02:39:49,380 --> 02:39:51,120
One or three, chat.

2263
02:39:52,020 --> 02:39:52,760
One or three.

2264
02:39:55,540 --> 02:39:56,260
What?

2265
02:40:00,540 --> 02:40:01,020
Smolder?

2266
02:40:01,780 --> 02:40:01,980
Okay.

2267
02:40:02,700 --> 02:40:03,980
We'll grab with Smolder.

2268
02:40:06,660 --> 02:40:06,980
Okay.

2269
02:40:08,360 --> 02:40:09,200
Oh no, I have one armor.

2270
02:40:09,440 --> 02:40:09,820
That's right.

2271
02:40:10,040 --> 02:40:11,640
1% upgrade damage.

2272
02:40:13,200 --> 02:40:13,560
Shit.

2273
02:40:14,120 --> 02:40:15,040
Got the ash.

2274
02:40:15,120 --> 02:40:16,140
Is there a tree anywhere?

2275
02:40:17,020 --> 02:40:17,760
Tree doko?

2276
02:40:20,580 --> 02:40:21,440
Wait, what?

2277
02:40:22,680 --> 02:40:23,760
Are you gonna kill still me?

2278
02:40:23,940 --> 02:40:26,340
I could be standing there on guard duty right now.

2279
02:40:29,460 --> 02:40:30,260
Yeah?

2280
02:40:31,840 --> 02:40:32,900
Oh my god, he's got...

2281
02:40:32,900 --> 02:40:33,280
She's gonna kill us.

2282
02:40:33,400 --> 02:40:33,700
No!

2283
02:40:34,380 --> 02:40:36,080
Are you fucking...

2284
02:40:36,080 --> 02:40:37,380
She kills us all!

2285
02:40:37,880 --> 02:40:38,920
She's actually...

2286
02:40:38,920 --> 02:40:41,320
She's actually following me!

2287
02:40:41,820 --> 02:40:43,500
Oh, that bitch!

2288
02:40:43,760 --> 02:40:46,140
She's actually following...

2289
02:40:46,140 --> 02:40:48,220
Oh my god!

2290
02:40:48,420 --> 02:40:50,160
You're so rude!

2291
02:40:51,740 --> 02:40:54,280
You're actually a bitch!

2292
02:40:55,060 --> 02:40:56,980
There's no way...

2293
02:40:56,980 --> 02:40:58,180
She's actually following me!

2294
02:40:58,200 --> 02:41:00,160
Body blocking me, dude.

2295
02:41:04,240 --> 02:41:05,220
Oh, thank God.

2296
02:41:05,520 --> 02:41:05,520
Okay.

2297
02:41:06,820 --> 02:41:07,880
Wait, did she win?

2298
02:41:09,620 --> 02:41:10,400
Did she win?

2299
02:41:10,820 --> 02:41:11,440
Oh, my God.

2300
02:41:11,520 --> 02:41:12,360
Wait, did she...

2301
02:41:12,360 --> 02:41:13,260
I don't even know.

2302
02:41:15,100 --> 02:41:15,720
Oh, my God.

2303
02:41:15,920 --> 02:41:16,540
Only one by two.

2304
02:41:16,680 --> 02:41:17,300
Okay, thank God.

2305
02:41:17,500 --> 02:41:18,300
Okay, I got...

2306
02:41:18,300 --> 02:41:18,840
Oh, thank God.

2307
02:41:18,900 --> 02:41:20,380
At least she didn't steal the hammer, guys.

2308
02:41:20,560 --> 02:41:22,060
At least... Bro, she's...

2309
02:41:22,060 --> 02:41:24,120
She's such a fucking hater.

2310
02:41:26,240 --> 02:41:27,040
She actually...

2311
02:41:27,040 --> 02:41:28,180

Okay, there she is.

Okay, your attack has more range and deals 100% damage.

2317
02:42:09,240 --> 02:42:10,100

Just because I can.

2370
02:45:59,210 --> 02:46:00,590

Thank you.

2390

I'm for the people.

2391
02:46:35,730 --> 02:46:36,610
I'm for the people.

2392
02:46:39,050 --> 02:46:40,270
Your sprint is faster.

2393
02:46:40,370 --> 02:46:41,330
Your attack has a chance.

2394
02:46:41,410 --> 02:46:41,750
Wait.

2395
02:46:43,410 --> 02:46:44,950
Does that mean I can hit four times?

2396
02:46:47,490 --> 02:46:47,850
Wait.

2397
02:46:48,270 --> 02:46:48,790
Oh, shit.

02:46:48,870 --> 02:46:49,730
Wait, this is good.

2399
02:46:52,370 --> 02:46:53,030
It's faster.

2400
02:46:53,110 --> 02:46:54,690
Oh, but I can have days, though.

2401
02:46:55,730 --> 02:46:57,250
Wait, I can have four hits.

2402
02:46:59,710 --> 02:47:00,070
Yeah.

2403
02:47:01,410 --> 02:47:02,010
I don't know.

2404
02:47:02,130 --> 02:47:02,770
Two or three.

2405
02:47:03,170 --> 02:47:03,810
Two or three.

2406
02:47:05,430 --> 02:47:06,250

02:47:08,530 --> 02:47:10,250
Where's my Oshi Aeros at, Doki?

2412
02:47:10,330 --> 02:47:11,330
Where is Best Girl?

2413
02:47:11,410 --> 02:47:11,950
Ares.

2414
02:47:13,650 --> 02:47:14,750
Don't worry about it.

2415
02:47:14,870 --> 02:47:15,550
They got her.

2416
02:47:17,350 --> 02:47:20,010
Oh, 5% is not 20, right?

2417
02:47:22,970 --> 02:47:25,190
What's up with the tomato salad?

2418
02:47:29,480 --> 02:47:30,760
What do you mean they got it?

2419
02:47:30,780 --> 02:47:31,620
Yeah, they got it.

2420
02:47:33,940 --> 02:47:35,380
Yeah, we're not gambling here.

2421
02:47:35,480 --> 02:47:36,360
Oh my god, I'm so fast.

2422
02:47:37,480 --> 02:47:39,160
I don't remember what the second...

2423
02:47:39,160 --> 02:47:39,660
Oh, it was days.

2424
02:47:39,840 --> 02:47:40,080
Okay.

2425
02:47:40,620 --> 02:47:41,720
We'll go to the shop.

2426
02:47:41,800 --> 02:47:42,900
We have so much to spend.

2427
02:47:44,340 --> 02:47:45,280
Oh, hey.

2428
02:47:47,020 --> 02:47:47,920
Dig this, huh?

2429
02:47:49,180 --> 02:47:49,840
Some seeds.

2430
02:47:50,080 --> 02:47:50,980
Oh, more seeds.

2431
02:47:52,540 --> 02:47:53,940
I might as well.

2432
02:47:55,940 --> 02:47:56,540
Cardio gain.

2433
02:47:56,620 --> 02:47:57,100
Oh, my God.

2434
02:47:57,240 --> 02:47:58,160
I'm even faster.

2435
02:47:59,500 --> 02:48:00,540
Your attacks are special.

2436
02:48:00,880 --> 02:48:02,900
Gain more your attacks inflict scorch.

2437
02:48:03,400 --> 02:48:04,340
What is the replace?

2438
02:48:05,840 --> 02:48:09,660
You need a chance to dodge, which is double against scorch
afflicted foes.

2439
02:48:10,800 --> 02:48:11,620
Three, right?

2440
02:48:12,060 --> 02:48:13,020
I should grab three.

2441
02:48:13,260 --> 02:48:14,740
So I can infuse something.

2442
02:48:15,940 --> 02:48:17,520
I just double check.

2443
02:48:19,420 --> 02:48:20,280
Right here.

2444
02:48:22,600 --> 02:48:23,200
Yeah!

2445
02:48:26,620 --> 02:48:27,620
Saberus, it's me.

2446
02:48:28,320 --> 02:48:28,800
It's me.

2447
02:48:29,660 --> 02:48:30,380
Don't you remember it?

2448
02:48:30,460 --> 02:48:31,800
And he's like, I kill!

2449
02:48:35,160 --> 02:48:38,080
Yeah, yeah, it definitely looks like he remembers.

2450
02:48:38,920 --> 02:48:40,560
Oh, good.

2451
02:48:46,160 --> 02:48:47,980

2452
02:48:48,500 --> 02:48:49,580
Oh, fucking course!

I think we forgot.

2459
02:49:03,460 --> 02:49:06,100
Remember when I had that special armor, or what?

2460
02:49:07,660 --> 02:49:09,160
That special armor.

2461
02:49:09,560 --> 02:49:11,480

02:50:20,920 --> 02:50:21,800
Who's a red shade?

2470
02:50:25,040 --> 02:50:26,660
Could switch my keepsake.

2471
02:50:31,430 --> 02:50:32,730
All right, we'll get the teeth now.

2472
02:50:33,010 --> 02:50:33,830
Just in case.

2473
02:50:35,030 --> 02:50:36,810
Keen plus 10 now.

2474
02:50:37,350 --> 02:50:39,090
Ensure a KS spawns.

2475
02:50:39,090 --> 02:50:40,650
It costs $0 to enter.

2476
02:50:40,670 --> 02:50:41,790
I can't afford all of this.

2477
02:50:42,770 --> 02:50:43,350
Yeah.

2478
02:50:44,330 --> 02:50:46,310
Oh, I keep forgetting I don't have access to this.

2479
02:50:47,270 --> 02:50:48,430
Oh, that's not...

2480
02:50:48,430 --> 02:50:48,570
Oh!

2481
02:50:48,590 --> 02:50:50,150
Oh yeah, I remember now!

2482
02:50:50,670 --> 02:50:51,670
Yo, he's alive!

2483
02:50:55,370 --> 02:50:56,390
Ground floor.

2484
02:50:56,950 --> 02:50:57,150
Alright.

2485
02:50:58,550 --> 02:51:00,090
Time to go through chaos.

2486
02:51:00,370 --> 02:51:01,230
But where's the chaos?

2487
02:51:02,470 --> 02:51:03,550
Does he not spawn here?

2488
02:51:03,650 --> 02:51:05,350
I guess he spawns in the next one?

2489
02:51:06,850 --> 02:51:08,990
Ever-shifting chambers, realign.

2490
02:51:09,890 --> 02:51:10,770
That's what I'm saying.

2491
02:51:10,810 --> 02:51:14,130
If you kill a demon, like, can he just respawn back in hell?

2492
02:51:15,570 --> 02:51:17,850
Like, if you, like, technically can't die.

2493
02:51:21,510 --> 02:51:23,010
That's like what I'm thinking.

2494
02:51:25,010 --> 02:51:26,850
Like, how do you kill something that's dead?

2495

Oh, my God.

02:51:37,760 --> 02:51:39,680
Alright, let's go through the chaos.

02:51:41,580 --> 02:51:44,160
Depends on the lore.

02:51:47,320 --> 02:51:48,140
But for next...

2501
02:51:48,140 --> 02:51:49,420
Each time you attack, you take...

2502
02:51:49,420 --> 02:51:50,800

2516
02:53:05,620 --> 02:53:08,740

2517
02:53:08,900 --> 02:53:09,120
Yeah.

2518
02:53:09,460 --> 02:53:10,240
Oh, I got the shard.

2519
02:53:11,140 --> 02:53:14,380
That's what I needed Wait, he gives shards?

2520
02:53:18,600 --> 02:53:19,000
What?

2521
02:53:24,840 --> 02:53:26,980
Oh shit, I could have even more mad.

2522
02:53:27,280 --> 02:53:28,040
Yeah, this one.

2523
02:53:29,280 --> 02:53:31,400
That's from the damage I already do.

2524
02:53:33,660 --> 02:53:34,580
Always use more.

2525
02:53:34,780 --> 02:53:36,960
Yeah, I have like even more damage now.

2526
02:53:38,140 --> 02:53:39,120
Oh shit, that time.

2527
02:53:41,620 --> 02:53:42,580
It's me.

2528
02:53:43,320 --> 02:53:44,140
Hello, father.

2529
02:53:44,880 --> 02:53:46,280
He visited me recently.

2530
02:53:46,380 --> 02:53:47,180
Yeah, I do 500.

2531
02:53:47,700 --> 02:53:49,040
I tell him where to find you.

2532
02:53:49,720 --> 02:53:51,120
I made clear I did not know.

2533
02:53:52,280 --> 02:54:00,100
drawing more of his attention why don't he just like get a
guy to follow me you're saying he tortured you that blasted

2534
02:54:00,100 --> 02:54:08,640
wretch you won't need to find me i'm about to find him
that's right i'm gonna kill him for the fifth time it's john

2535
02:54:08,640 --> 02:54:17,200
haynes it's crazy the haiti is not even based off of his
kids he's such a deadbeat he even gets the game named after

2536
02:54:17,200 --> 02:54:25,860
himself Like, I wish I wasn't born.

2537
02:54:26,260 --> 02:54:29,320
I know the tales of how you vanquished him, but no so little
of how it was for you.

2538
02:54:29,360 --> 02:54:33,000
Yeah, why doesn't he turn back time and watch where you came
from?

2539
02:54:37,680 --> 02:54:38,900
We often fought.

2540
02:54:39,600 --> 02:54:41,160
He believed we would take after him.

2541
02:54:41,900 --> 02:54:42,500
None of us did.

2542
02:54:42,800 --> 02:54:43,860
What a child he is?

2543
02:54:44,220 --> 02:54:46,980
I just decided that the time had come for us to rule in his
stead.

2544
02:54:48,240 --> 02:54:49,920
He resisted bitterly.

2545
02:54:50,860 --> 02:54:52,460
But these old memories...

2546
02:54:52,460 --> 02:54:52,580
Aw.

2547
02:54:53,140 --> 02:54:54,480
I would leave them buried.

2548
02:54:58,570 --> 02:54:59,010
Yeah.

2549
02:55:00,430 --> 02:55:07,310
restore life for one percent damage you deal until you reach
the limit after you take okay deal more based on how many

2550
02:55:07,310 --> 02:55:20,230
times you used i don't even oh i mean if i none of this is
good so i guess i'll get three for the prophecies that i can

2551
02:55:20,230 --> 02:55:31,670
spare you honor me can i pet you now is it because i keep
beating you up understand The once feared Underworld King

2552
02:55:31,670 --> 02:55:36,330
resembles now the wretched and the damned that here was
shackled in his stead.

2553
02:55:37,030 --> 02:55:40,570
Until the scheming Titan Kronos cut them loose.

2554
02:55:41,930 --> 02:55:42,770
I don't understand.

2555
02:55:43,790 --> 02:55:45,630
Why does he never let me pet him?

2556
02:55:46,130 --> 02:55:46,850
It's not my fault.

2557
02:55:46,970 --> 02:55:48,170
He was a bad boy.

2558
02:55:49,770 --> 02:55:52,130
He literally tried to kill me first.

2559
02:55:55,790 --> 02:55:56,650
Alright, nice.

2560
02:55:58,770 --> 02:55:59,630
What the fuck?

2561
02:55:59,650 --> 02:56:10,390
chaos oh my god forgot i can't cast i it's like what the hit

2562
02:56:10,390 --> 02:56:24,370

because i don't know where the fuck things are bro please

2563
02:56:24,370 --> 02:56:26,870

2564
02:56:30,530 --> 02:56:31,650
Mining, mining.

2565
02:56:32,550 --> 02:56:34,070
Uh, three.

2566
02:56:34,270 --> 02:56:35,430
We'll grab more money.

2567
02:56:38,510 --> 02:56:39,310
It's okay.

2568
02:56:39,450 --> 02:56:40,430
I have, like, double it.

2569
02:56:40,930 --> 02:56:41,690
Oh, my God.

2570
02:56:41,870 --> 02:56:43,350
That cooldown is so good.

2571
02:56:44,410 --> 02:56:44,930
Oh, God.

2572
02:56:47,250 --> 02:56:47,810
Okay.

2573
02:56:48,530 --> 02:56:49,250
Okay, technique.

2574
02:56:49,490 --> 02:56:49,990
No, I don't need a heal.

2575
02:56:50,230 --> 02:56:50,650
Not yet.

2576
02:56:52,610 --> 02:56:54,730
Two second shit is, like, clutching it.

2577
02:56:54,810 --> 02:56:56,150
I'm just all damage.

2578
02:56:56,930 --> 02:56:58,370
All damage, no defense.

2579
02:57:01,010 --> 02:57:01,910
Yay, money!

2580
02:57:04,670 --> 02:57:05,890
Uh, down I go.

2581
02:57:06,210 --> 02:57:07,430
I think I need, what, two more?

2582
02:57:08,050 --> 02:57:09,530
I mean, wait, am I good now?

2583
02:57:10,930 --> 02:57:11,630
Oh, shit.

2584
02:57:12,950 --> 02:57:14,430
Wait, can I cast now?

2585
02:57:14,510 --> 02:57:15,250
I can't, no.

2586
02:57:17,430 --> 02:57:18,410
I've lost count.

2587
02:57:19,570 --> 02:57:21,050
I have not been counting.

2588
02:57:22,210 --> 02:57:22,830
Oh, I can cast now.

2589
02:57:22,930 --> 02:57:23,230
That's good.

2590
02:57:23,850 --> 02:57:24,530
Oh, yeah, I can!

2591
02:57:26,970 --> 02:57:28,050
It's been so long.

2592
02:57:28,110 --> 02:57:30,850
I don't even remember what the word was.

2593
02:57:33,410 --> 02:57:34,430
Okay, nice.

2594
02:57:35,750 --> 02:57:36,150
What did I...

2595
02:57:36,150 --> 02:57:37,390
Oh, it was HP, right?

2596
02:57:37,530 --> 02:57:38,630
Oh, my God, I have so much HP.

2597
02:57:39,130 --> 02:57:40,310
Okay, now I definitely remember.

2598
02:57:40,430 --> 02:57:40,930
I don't remember.

2599
02:57:41,010 --> 02:57:42,230
I have a lot of health.

2600
02:57:43,670 --> 02:57:46,430
I was like, oh, my God, that does not look normal.

2601
02:57:50,770 --> 02:57:51,550
Alright, nice.

2602
02:57:52,550 --> 02:57:53,630
I was like, yeah, wait a minute.

2603
02:57:53,770 --> 02:57:54,850
This does not look normal.

2604
02:57:54,950 --> 02:57:56,630
Am I supposed to have that much health?

2605
02:57:59,250 --> 02:57:59,610
Okay.

2606
02:57:59,650 --> 02:58:00,410
Two tab.

2607
02:58:04,860 --> 02:58:05,300
Goodness.

2608
02:58:09,180 --> 02:58:10,780
Okay, we'll break that first.

2609
02:58:12,120 --> 02:58:12,700
Bro, let's just...

2610
02:58:12,700 --> 02:58:13,960
I can get this out of the way.

2611
02:58:15,020 --> 02:58:15,380
Magic!

2612
02:58:15,640 --> 02:58:15,740
Oh!

2613
02:58:16,400 --> 02:58:16,780
Alright.

2614
02:58:18,380 --> 02:58:19,560
Oh my god, okay.

2615
02:58:19,740 --> 02:58:20,780
I might have got a little bit...

2616
02:58:20,780 --> 02:58:21,800
I got a little cocky there.

2617
02:58:23,080 --> 02:58:24,220
I thought I just...

2618
02:58:24,220 --> 02:58:24,540
I don't know.

2619
02:58:24,580 --> 02:58:25,580
I thought I just lived.

2620
02:58:29,230 --> 02:58:30,510
I thought I could tank it.

2621
02:58:31,290 --> 02:58:32,230
Technically, I could.

2622
02:58:33,250 --> 02:58:34,270
Okay, one chamber.

2623
02:58:40,730 --> 02:58:41,870
There's so much...

2624
02:58:41,870 --> 02:58:43,570
These guys are so tanky, though.

2625
02:58:44,770 --> 02:58:45,570
Alright, nice.

2626
02:58:47,810 --> 02:58:49,290
Jesus, I didn't even see him.

2627
02:58:51,110 --> 02:58:51,510
You know what?

2628
02:58:51,530 --> 02:58:53,510
Fuck it, I'm just gonna heal just for the sake of it.

2629
02:58:55,670 --> 02:58:57,910
I know I only have one heal left, but that's fine.

2630
02:58:58,350 --> 02:58:59,190
That's all I need.

2631
02:58:59,370 --> 02:59:00,490
One heal and a dream.

2632
02:59:02,230 --> 02:59:02,610
Okay.

2633
02:59:05,570 --> 02:59:07,670
Alright, I have 1,300.

2634
02:59:08,350 --> 02:59:10,230
Okay, what the fuck is this?

2635
02:59:10,350 --> 02:59:11,730
Oh, it's plus three upgrade.

2636
02:59:13,390 --> 02:59:15,690
Um, yeah, but I can't afford this, though.

2637
02:59:17,030 --> 02:59:17,810
Is that just moon?

2638
02:59:18,810 --> 02:59:19,830
What's this up?

2639
02:59:19,930 --> 02:59:21,050
That's the moon, right?

2640
02:59:21,210 --> 02:59:21,790
Moon does?

2641
02:59:22,690 --> 02:59:24,110
Is it actually worth it?

2642
02:59:24,290 --> 02:59:25,310
What the fuck is it?

2643
02:59:35,200 --> 02:59:36,780
Oh, arcana cards!

2644
02:59:36,960 --> 02:59:37,380
Oh!

2645
02:59:38,520 --> 02:59:39,000
Okay.

2646
02:59:40,760 --> 02:59:41,820
Is it forever?

2647
02:59:41,980 --> 02:59:43,080
Does it buff it forever?

2648
02:59:43,600 --> 02:59:44,080
Okay.

2649
02:59:53,650 --> 02:59:54,490
Oh!

2650
02:59:56,590 --> 02:59:57,230
Alright.

2651
02:59:58,190 --> 02:59:59,690
I'll grab that.

2652
03:00:02,950 --> 03:00:03,790
Uh...

2653
03:00:05,010 --> 03:00:07,030
We don't need heals.

2654
03:00:07,350 --> 03:00:08,830
I guess we can buy this.

2655
03:00:09,590 --> 03:00:10,470
What's this again?

2656
03:00:11,790 --> 03:00:12,770
Is this like random?

2657
03:00:16,310 --> 03:00:17,050
Random.

2658
03:00:17,490 --> 03:00:18,190
Random, right?

2659
03:00:19,570 --> 03:00:20,410
Oh.

2660
03:00:20,730 --> 03:00:22,010
Got it for a discount.

2661
03:00:23,730 --> 03:00:24,570
Okay.

2662
03:00:24,950 --> 03:00:26,750
I just got this for a discount.

2663
03:00:26,950 --> 03:00:27,390
Let's go.

2664
03:00:32,230 --> 03:00:35,070
The scorch effect deals damage faster.

2665
03:00:37,090 --> 03:00:38,270
I think I need two.

2666
03:00:39,030 --> 03:00:39,350
Yeah.

2667
03:00:40,490 --> 03:00:41,590
And then, fuck it.

2668
03:00:41,630 --> 03:00:42,110
More HP.

2669
03:00:42,290 --> 03:00:42,930
I might as well.

2670
03:00:43,210 --> 03:00:43,830
Plus 60.

2671
03:00:44,150 --> 03:00:44,910
Yeah, fuck it.

2672
03:00:44,950 --> 03:00:47,430
I mean, I could grab full HP right now.

2673
03:00:47,930 --> 03:00:48,870
But, nah.

2674
03:00:50,250 --> 03:00:51,090
Grab this.

2675
03:00:51,350 --> 03:00:52,910
Technically, it's the same.

2676
03:00:55,410 --> 03:00:56,950
Okay, let's go in.

2677
03:00:59,710 --> 03:00:59,730
Nah.

2678
03:01:01,930 --> 03:01:02,950
Yeah, but then my...

2679
03:01:02,950 --> 03:01:05,750
If I die, if I die, I get more back.

2680
03:01:06,730 --> 03:01:07,650
Because I have the golden tooth.

2681
03:01:09,010 --> 03:01:09,730
That's right.

2682
03:01:10,090 --> 03:01:10,810
I'm back.

2683
03:01:12,110 --> 03:01:17,950
You, with all that vengeance on your mind, claiming to care
nothing for the family which I denied you.

2684
03:01:18,610 --> 03:01:21,450
Good, because you certainly did not miss much.

2685
03:01:21,890 --> 03:01:23,890
It had nothing for our family either.

2686
03:01:24,170 --> 03:01:24,710
And who's this?

2687
03:01:24,950 --> 03:01:35,630
rot you are no different i mean my family cares you alone
they just didn't care about you come on they left you to rot

2688
03:01:35,630 --> 03:01:45,110
because you gave them every reason to hate you it's salt
power i refuse to share they have not worked for it perhaps

2689
03:01:45,110 --> 03:01:51,770
if they asked nicely none of oh he's like bill gates there
is no undoing past mistakes but like not i'm not saying bill

2690
03:01:51,770 --> 03:01:58,750
gates is as evil as cronos i'm saying that he decided He was
like, I'm not going to give my sons any money because they

2691
03:01:58,750 --> 03:01:59,870
didn't work for it.

2692
03:02:00,250 --> 03:02:04,150
He was like, I'm going to, when I die, I'm going to donate
all my money to charity.

2693
03:02:04,690 --> 03:02:10,410
But like, I'm saying that he's like the, let Bill Gates,
it's like, you know, the evil version of Bill Gates.

2694
03:02:12,510 --> 03:02:18,730
I have to say he's like the evil version of Bill Gates,
guys.

2695
03:02:19,030 --> 03:02:24,670
I'm not trying to imply that Bill Gates is Kronos, guys.

2696
03:02:24,950 --> 03:02:27,730
That's not what I'm trying to fly.

2697
03:02:28,890 --> 03:02:30,430
Oh, I fucked up.

2698
03:02:30,750 --> 03:02:31,310
Oh, fuck.

2699
03:02:31,530 --> 03:02:32,130
I fucked up.

2700
03:02:34,850 --> 03:02:36,330
I did not see that.

2701
03:02:41,520 --> 03:02:42,100
Alright.

2702
03:02:45,060 --> 03:02:45,900
Jesus Christ.

2703
03:02:51,060 --> 03:02:51,640
Alright.

2704
03:02:54,340 --> 03:02:55,880
Oh, my God.

2705
03:02:57,420 --> 03:03:00,300
I'm, like, tanking everything, apparently.

2706
03:03:08,800 --> 03:03:11,000
Alright, okay, we gotta get rid of these, though.

2707
03:03:13,420 --> 03:03:16,100
Oh god, oh god, I'm getting hit by all the Toho's.

2708
03:03:20,720 --> 03:03:21,640
Alright, that's fine.

2709
03:03:22,280 --> 03:03:23,140
Oh shit!

2710
03:03:24,020 --> 03:03:24,800
What the fuck?

2711
03:03:24,840 --> 03:03:26,100
Okay, I'm getting hit by everything.

2712
03:03:31,100 --> 03:03:31,540
Nice.

2713
03:03:34,500 --> 03:03:35,380
Kratoski, please.

2714
03:03:39,700 --> 03:03:40,500
Yeah, look at this.

2715
03:03:40,520 --> 03:03:51,840
You're weaker now Look how weak you are It took you six gods
to die, but now you're dying from one child And that was I

2716
03:03:51,840 --> 03:03:57,360
say about you, bro God damn it.

2717
03:03:57,360 --> 03:03:59,120
Oh my god, I'm taking everything.

2718
03:03:59,120 --> 03:03:59,320
Oh

2719
03:04:03,400 --> 03:04:05,180
Yay depth of fire.

2720
03:04:05,620 --> 03:04:06,200
Okay, I have two more.

2721
03:04:06,600 --> 03:04:07,340
I have two more.

2722
03:04:07,600 --> 03:04:08,880
I have two more guys.

2723
03:04:08,980 --> 03:04:09,480
It's okay.

2724
03:04:09,880 --> 03:04:12,080
It's okay I have two more, guys.

2725
03:04:12,740 --> 03:04:16,500
Okay, I might be getting a little too cocky right now.

2726
03:04:16,620 --> 03:04:17,180
What the fuck?

2727
03:04:17,520 --> 03:04:18,460
Oh, God, that was scary.

2728
03:04:22,650 --> 03:04:23,710
Oh, my God!

2729
03:04:23,790 --> 03:04:24,830
Okay, that's cheating!

2730
03:04:26,390 --> 03:04:27,290
Oh, my God.

2731
03:04:27,490 --> 03:04:27,610
Okay.

2732
03:04:29,250 --> 03:04:30,370
Guys, you don't understand.

2733
03:04:30,530 --> 03:04:32,290
I'm like, I'm confused.

2734
03:04:33,730 --> 03:04:34,450
I'm confused.

2735
03:04:37,630 --> 03:04:39,610
See, I have one more depth of finds, guys.

2736
03:04:40,050 --> 03:04:41,870
I still have one more.

2737
03:04:41,890 --> 03:04:47,170
Oh my god.

2738
03:04:47,510 --> 03:04:48,330
Wait, where is he?

2739
03:04:48,410 --> 03:04:48,950
Oh, it's okay.

2740
03:04:49,070 --> 03:04:49,610
I made it

2741
03:04:56,980 --> 03:04:57,660
Yay!

2742
03:05:02,700 --> 03:05:04,480
I didn't throw.

2743
03:05:04,960 --> 03:05:09,660
I just knew I had enough damage to face tank everything.

2744
03:05:10,580 --> 03:05:11,580
It's not throwing.

2745
03:05:13,660 --> 03:05:16,980
With them, you say, not us.

2746
03:05:17,460 --> 03:05:20,100
You too are a reject daughter of Hades.

2747
03:05:20,800 --> 03:05:21,960
A reject?

2748
03:05:22,500 --> 03:05:24,080
And always would have been.

2749
03:05:24,840 --> 03:05:26,900
I'm not a reject.

2750
03:05:27,360 --> 03:05:29,900
You just fucking took my family away.

2751
03:05:30,100 --> 03:05:34,060
It's not rejection if you fucking stole my family.

2752
03:05:39,470 --> 03:05:42,210
If anything, my brother's the reject.

2753
03:05:46,530 --> 03:05:49,190
His mom left him, not me.

2754
03:05:56,310 --> 03:05:59,790
The most HP is a research fight I've ever seen.

2755
03:06:00,070 --> 03:06:00,430
I fell in.

2756
03:06:00,530 --> 03:06:01,690
Thank you for the super chat.

2757
03:06:01,950 --> 03:06:02,070
Thank you.

2758
03:06:02,490 --> 03:06:02,910
Thank you.

2759
03:06:04,930 --> 03:06:06,130
So much, dust.

2760
03:06:07,550 --> 03:06:07,970
All right.

2761
03:06:08,530 --> 03:06:10,610
Go back into the realm.

2762
03:06:11,210 --> 03:06:12,270
To the face of the subconscious, I descend.

2763
03:06:15,270 --> 03:06:15,950
Yeah, see?

2764
03:06:16,610 --> 03:06:19,110
I still had HP, guys.

2765
03:06:20,110 --> 03:06:25,370
night and darkness guide me to my blood beyond the grasp of
time

2766
03:06:39,440 --> 03:06:50,800
yeah that's me yeah as me hello again sister you wanted me
to search for signs of chronos preparing for a big surprise

2767
03:06:50,800 --> 03:06:59,160
and while it isn't much i did locate machinery and tartarus
that seemed a little out of place oh machinery you mean the

2768
03:06:59,160 --> 03:07:05,100
gears that turn the ever-shifting chambers in my time that
machinery is spread through Tartarus as far as I can see

2769
03:07:05,100 --> 03:07:12,500
what do you make of it well normally I wouldn't have made
anything of it but perhaps it's connected to what you're

2770
03:07:12,500 --> 03:07:21,080
saying I'm working on tracing where it leads what about you
any word on how we ought to proceed we need a weapon the

2771
03:07:21,080 --> 03:07:27,080
problem is that Kronos can resist the arms once used to
vanquish him on top of that it needs to be available both to

2772
03:07:29,200 --> 03:07:37,740
mine closer to our family the better can you think of
something suitable oh we're gonna make a weapon guys I have

2773
03:07:37,740 --> 03:07:44,080
some mortal weapons in my chambers but they hardly worked at
any point a weapon both in my time and in yours and none of

2774
03:07:44,080 --> 03:07:51,440
the infernal arms will do give it some thought but please
make haste Kronos shall realize what I'm up to here

2775
03:07:51,440 --> 03:07:59,760
eventually and this connection weakens every night for now
I'd better go hold on what happened the servants of this

2776
03:07:59,760 --> 03:08:11,640
house to my friends loves damn to be fair as a god there's
no such thing as monogamy as a god but loves of my life damn

2777
03:08:11,640 --> 03:08:25,240
zayrus well no um hypnosis with us but fast asleep yeah he's
a boy sure is bro he literally has a poster of his fucking

2778
03:08:25,240 --> 03:08:25,860
cousin.

2779
03:08:26,680 --> 03:08:28,220
I'm not in his room.

2780
03:08:28,440 --> 03:08:29,640
This guy, this boy's a freak.

2781
03:08:29,680 --> 03:08:31,480
Oh, at least the good commander Skelemias made it out.

2782
03:08:32,220 --> 03:08:35,700
But Nick's Achilles Thanatos, Megara, Deucer, Orpheus.

2783
03:08:36,560 --> 03:08:38,420
Jesus, that's a lot of names.

2784
03:08:38,800 --> 03:08:39,340
How many?

2785
03:08:39,580 --> 03:08:40,760
How many did you use?

2786
03:08:42,440 --> 03:08:45,140
I understand he's trapped the others, frozen them in time.

2787
03:08:45,800 --> 03:08:47,140
But we can break his hold on them.

2788
03:08:47,380 --> 03:08:48,380
I'm certain that we can.

2789
03:08:49,200 --> 03:08:50,120
Goodbye for now, brother.

2790
03:08:50,760 --> 03:08:52,660
Think of a weapon we can use to set this right.

2791
03:08:54,900 --> 03:09:10,120
All right Bye Zagreus Bro, he even he he's a freak He even
dated a head a floating head That boy's a freak Glad to be

2793
03:09:13,060 --> 03:09:24,460
Bye Zagreus You think that you achieved a victory which um
Prolonged your demise for the Titan whom you vanquished

2794
03:09:24,460 --> 03:09:33,520
possessing but the smallest fraction of my power yeah she
all right i'm surprised and humbled that you damed to pay my

2795
03:09:33,520 --> 03:09:43,520
meager accomplishments any heed oh spirit yeah how did you
know i am all knowing also the shades out there were going

2796

god you guys are gossipers out there i think don't diss

2797
03:09:51,460 --> 03:09:56,520

Zagres will date anything.

2798
03:09:57,080 --> 03:10:00,080
Dutifully organized and immaculately clean.

2799
03:10:00,200 --> 03:10:01,820
Like, he need no body, apparently.

2800
03:10:02,140 --> 03:10:03,800
A head is fine enough for him.

2801
03:10:04,640 --> 03:10:06,120
Yeah, gossiping shades.

2802
03:10:06,540 --> 03:10:07,240
Shake my head.

2803
03:10:08,640 --> 03:10:10,160
Good evening, everyone.

2804
03:10:11,340 --> 03:10:12,600
There's something new here.

2805
03:10:13,780 --> 03:10:14,220
Alright.

2806
03:10:14,880 --> 03:10:16,880
What else do you need?

2807
03:10:17,220 --> 03:10:18,260
Sassy victory.

2808
03:10:20,060 --> 03:10:23,700
We heard about the Titan's latest misfortune by your hand.

2809
03:10:25,320 --> 03:10:33,480
Proceeding as intended by your estimation I think so We just
need to find a suitable weapon now And then everything

2810
03:10:33,480 --> 03:10:43,340
that's come to pass So progressive Perhaps not everything
But plenty You know the rest by heart And I'll not pry for

2811
03:10:43,340 --> 03:10:49,120
further details But should an unexpected I don't know maybe
stop fucking fighting me Hecatee?

2812
03:10:49,240 --> 03:10:56,380
Like we're on the same side I don't need no test no more
Here's a thought Rich soil need it gives me more stuff to

2813
03:10:56,380 --> 03:11:12,580
plant okay do i have the seeds though for it jesus fucking
christ that's a tumor i like what the fuck some weed hey god

2814
03:11:12,580 --> 03:11:25,060
that's that's just a tumor taking matters into a very
capable hands not making too much grief for you i reckon so

2815
03:11:25,060 --> 03:11:33,460
you know already and like i just gave that plant fucking
cancer this is being nemesis discovering firsthand our task

2816
03:11:33,460 --> 03:11:40,820
is not as simple as it seems say no more than though if she
becomes too intent on impeding your results over achieving

2817
03:11:40,820 --> 03:11:53,320
her own we'll step in yeah it won't come to that i shall my
lord until then we each have our tasks to complete All

2818
03:11:53,320 --> 03:11:54,840
right, I should have more psyche here.

2819
03:11:54,960 --> 03:11:55,100
Yay!

2820
03:11:56,840 --> 03:11:58,160

2823
03:12:01,480 --> 03:12:03,660
Yeah, I did not farm a lot of ash this time.

2824
03:12:04,780 --> 03:12:07,600
Uh, I gotta check up on this.

2825
03:12:08,360 --> 03:12:09,420
Wait, let's grab the...

2826
03:12:09,420 --> 03:12:10,620

Yay!

2829
03:12:16,280 --> 03:12:17,580

03:12:18,680 --> 03:12:20,440
Okay, this needs...

I don't even know how to grab it.

2832
03:12:21,820 --> 03:12:23,960
I guess they're like, oh, they're on the surface, right?

2833
03:12:24,380 --> 03:12:27,680
Alright, so I'm going to get the Tooth Defiance for now.

2834
03:12:28,000 --> 03:12:28,000
Okay.

2835
03:12:28,480 --> 03:12:29,220
A boon.

2836
03:12:29,620 --> 03:12:31,020
It's like, oh, for a Hef.

2837
03:12:31,460 --> 03:12:31,460
Okay.

2838
03:12:31,760 --> 03:12:32,700
This is for a Hef.

2839
03:12:34,680 --> 03:12:35,680
Alright, so...

2840
03:12:35,680 --> 03:12:36,800
Upgrade again.

2841
03:12:39,340 --> 03:12:39,840
Um...

2842
03:12:39,840 --> 03:12:41,540
We don't want to grab this.

2843
03:12:44,580 --> 03:12:45,080
Nope.

2844
03:12:46,580 --> 03:12:48,340
Oh, I need that.

2845
03:12:50,360 --> 03:12:51,480
What can I up?

2846
03:12:51,500 --> 03:12:51,800
I can't.

2847
03:12:51,820 --> 03:13:05,340
get any i mean technically i can activate this i guess i can
farm some stuff 45 all right let's see

2848
03:13:09,340 --> 03:13:18,000
uh do i need more ash i feel like i just farm more uh i'll
just spend it on i'll sparring it on psyche uh spend it on

2849
03:13:18,000 --> 03:13:23,040
psyche and then what do i need okay We need moss.

2850
03:13:24,580 --> 03:13:27,820
I could just plan for the nightshade, but...

2851
03:13:28,800 --> 03:13:30,900
We'll grab moss right now.

2852
03:13:34,660 --> 03:13:35,580
Do I have enough for Sherrod?

2853
03:13:35,800 --> 03:13:36,380
I don't know.

2854
03:13:37,400 --> 03:13:37,980
Let's check.

2855
03:13:40,000 --> 03:13:41,020
Another two credit cards.

2856
03:13:41,100 --> 03:13:41,660
Oh, I do!

2857
03:13:42,000 --> 03:13:42,760
Alright, more psyche.

2858
03:13:43,320 --> 03:13:44,160
Psyche is always good.

2859
03:13:45,380 --> 03:13:46,680
Yeah, we're gonna go for the...

2860
03:13:46,680 --> 03:13:49,680
We're just gonna farm moss and then get downstairs.

2861
03:13:51,860 --> 03:14:00,080
Regardless whatever happens the world now holds the key to
the once water gateway is gonna find moss and then die But

2862
03:14:00,080 --> 03:14:02,580
how is she to fare in that forbidden realm?

2863
03:14:04,460 --> 03:14:09,160
We'll find time Wait, how did you what?

2864
03:14:09,460 --> 03:14:10,840
How did you what?

2865
03:14:13,240 --> 03:14:13,960
I will not fail.

2866
03:14:14,060 --> 03:14:14,620
Oh, there you go.

2867
03:14:14,980 --> 03:14:18,360
We did it We did it.

2868
03:14:18,740 --> 03:14:24,760
We suddenly grow the other one though to be here little star
Your cursed blood shall fight your every step.

2869
03:14:25,200 --> 03:14:26,760
Yet Nix herself would understand.

2870
03:14:27,020 --> 03:14:29,880
Okay, we still need to grow the fucking tumor plan.

2871
03:14:33,680 --> 03:14:38,400
Alright, your pecs makes everything else move slower.

2872
03:14:39,120 --> 03:14:40,160
Fuck it, we'll just grab this.

2873
03:14:40,460 --> 03:14:43,940
It doesn't matter, we're gonna fucking pass out anyway.

2874
03:14:44,560 --> 03:14:47,100
So we're just gonna do this as fast as we can.

2875
03:14:50,000 --> 03:14:51,640
Because I'm just gonna get passed out soon.

2876
03:14:52,440 --> 03:14:54,220
Does it matter if I grab money?

2877
03:14:54,440 --> 03:14:55,300
Oh, there you go.

2878
03:14:55,760 --> 03:14:58,240
There we go.

2879
03:15:00,620 --> 03:15:01,560
Oh, God, not the birds.

2880
03:15:01,660 --> 03:15:03,780
Who would have thought the birds are...

2881
03:15:03,780 --> 03:15:06,200
Does more damage than the fucking demons?

2882
03:15:10,040 --> 03:15:10,580
Okay.

2883
03:15:11,940 --> 03:15:12,440
Okay.

2884
03:15:12,960 --> 03:15:16,640
Why are the birds stronger than the fucking ghosts?

2885
03:15:16,700 --> 03:15:19,720
Why are the birds stronger than the fucking ghosts?

2886
03:15:22,060 --> 03:15:24,460
The birds are the true demons.

2887
03:15:27,020 --> 03:15:27,960
Taxiomar damage.

2888
03:15:28,900 --> 03:15:30,980
And oh my god, he gave me Ice Strike too.

2889
03:15:34,680 --> 03:15:35,000
Alright.

2890
03:15:36,120 --> 03:15:38,000
I'll go as fast as I can.

2891
03:15:39,640 --> 03:15:39,940
Whoops.

2892
03:15:41,220 --> 03:15:41,700
I don't know.

2893
03:15:42,240 --> 03:15:43,380
We'll go in here.

2894
03:15:44,240 --> 03:15:45,720
I don't think I'm gonna live too long.

2895
03:15:45,880 --> 03:15:48,680
Because all the enemies are so fucking strong.

2896
03:15:50,780 --> 03:15:51,320
But...

2897
03:15:52,180 --> 03:15:53,140
I don't know.

2898
03:15:53,260 --> 03:15:54,660
I think I'm dead in here.

2899
03:15:59,830 --> 03:16:01,110
Yeah, I ain't doing so well.

2900
03:16:01,610 --> 03:16:03,330
I'm gonna die so fast.

2901
03:16:04,830 --> 03:16:05,430
Moonbeam!

2902
03:16:06,930 --> 03:16:08,450
With the power of the moon!

2903
03:16:09,870 --> 03:16:11,310
It's all I have!

2904
03:16:11,630 --> 03:16:12,190
Oh, goodbye.

2905
03:16:12,430 --> 03:16:12,810
I'm dead.

2906
03:16:15,190 --> 03:16:15,610
Goodbye.

2907
03:16:16,790 --> 03:16:17,310
It's okay.

2908
03:16:17,690 --> 03:16:19,230
I have... Oh, never mind.

2909
03:16:21,070 --> 03:16:23,170
Wait, Death Defiance doesn't...

2910
03:16:27,070 --> 03:16:31,190
What's the point of having death defiance if I just die?

2911
03:16:37,570 --> 03:16:39,270
I can't defy my death.

2912
03:16:39,350 --> 03:16:40,550
Oh, it's only in hell.

2913
03:16:42,090 --> 03:16:42,750
Everything okay there, Mal?

2914
03:16:44,930 --> 03:16:45,990
Oh, yes, Dora.

2915
03:16:46,370 --> 03:16:47,190
It's just...

2916
03:16:47,750 --> 03:16:49,090
I should have gone farther that time.

2917
03:16:49,370 --> 03:16:50,430
Death acceptance.

2918
03:16:50,790 --> 03:16:51,970
I'll give more notes on your haunting later, alright?

2919
03:16:53,330 --> 03:16:55,190
Oh, it's because the fate decided.

2920
03:16:57,050 --> 03:16:57,850
That's crazy.

2921
03:16:59,050 --> 03:17:01,390
All that you take from the earth shall be returned.

2922
03:17:01,550 --> 03:17:02,590
The fate was like, no.

2923
03:17:02,930 --> 03:17:06,250
You said before, you think Kynos is going to influence the
weavings of the fates.

2924
03:17:07,050 --> 03:17:09,090
You mean he's going to try to change the future.

2925
03:17:09,630 --> 03:17:11,130
Force a favorable outcome.

2926
03:17:11,790 --> 03:17:15,190
Even though the fates are literally kidnapped right now,
they're like, nope.

2927
03:17:15,850 --> 03:17:17,170
Well, she's trying to save us.

2928
03:17:17,230 --> 03:17:18,310
Let's make it harder for her.

2929
03:17:20,930 --> 03:17:21,330
Unfortunately.

2930
03:17:21,690 --> 03:17:23,170
Yeah, see, the fates are a bit too hard.

2931
03:17:23,190 --> 03:17:24,090
We have headstrong.

2932
03:17:24,570 --> 03:17:24,610
Headstrong.

2933
03:17:25,410 --> 03:17:28,050
I trust they may be quite resistant as captives.

2934
03:17:29,730 --> 03:17:32,950
And no shit, they're not even trying to make this easy for
me to save their ass.

2935
03:17:33,290 --> 03:17:34,050
Or anybody else.

2936
03:17:34,930 --> 03:17:36,070
How he must hate them.

2937
03:17:36,410 --> 03:17:39,550
When he was overthrown before, that was the outcome of a
fated prophecy.

2938
03:17:40,910 --> 03:17:42,350
Yeah, they're actual rage baiters.

2939
03:17:42,530 --> 03:17:45,390
As for now, I sense there are no weavings happening at all.

2940
03:17:46,030 --> 03:17:47,470
No new futures foretold.

2941
03:17:48,310 --> 03:17:50,030
Kronos believes he has no prophecy to fear.

2942
03:17:50,030 --> 03:17:52,090
Oh shit, he literally stopped the future.

2943
03:17:53,190 --> 03:18:03,510
opportunity for you to make a look at who oh hey eras you
fucking bitch i thought i'd be there to see your face again

2944
03:18:03,510 --> 03:18:12,530

been a little while it's not been long enough much as i

can't imagine you've returned for any reason other than to

2946
03:18:17,270 --> 03:18:24,770

big sister if not you I get it, you're still mad, I slowed

2947
03:18:24,770 --> 03:18:24,850
you down.

2948
03:18:24,850 --> 03:18:26,850
Yes, I am still mad!

2949
03:18:27,350 --> 03:18:30,490
You've made my stream six hours long!

2950
03:18:31,050 --> 03:18:32,950
Longer than it should be!

2951
03:18:33,630 --> 03:18:34,890
What do you mean?

2952
03:18:36,130 --> 03:18:41,110
Oh, are you still mad that I made you stream like 10 hours
straight?

2953
03:18:41,330 --> 03:18:44,810
I mean, she didn't make me stream, but I could have finished
it.

2954
03:18:45,130 --> 03:18:48,630
I could have fucking beat Kronos like in three hours.

2955
03:18:51,330 --> 03:18:53,170
Oh, don't worry, I'll be fine.

2956
03:18:53,190 --> 03:19:01,930
I know those woods out there like the back of my She gave us
content I'm always grateful for your hospitality great

2957
03:19:01,930 --> 03:19:12,090
tightness And you are welcome here and safe, Arachne Now I
must beg your pardon The matters that unfold of late require

2958
03:19:12,090 --> 03:19:19,670
more of my attention than I'd like I truly understand Then
I'll get out of your hair Why is she here?

2959
03:19:20,530 --> 03:19:24,850
Yeah, go back to your home She's like, I'm here to clean my
dinner.

2960
03:19:25,450 --> 03:19:26,010
Oh, yeah.

2961
03:19:26,090 --> 03:19:27,710
I have to give her stuff too.

2962
03:19:28,950 --> 03:19:32,030
Look, I do want you to feel welcome here and safe.

2963
03:19:32,450 --> 03:19:35,270
It's not just something about to give her free stuff.

2964
03:19:39,450 --> 03:19:43,310
Thank you, Ares, for giving us more time with the bird.

2965
03:19:43,650 --> 03:19:45,210
Gavin, thank you for the super chat.

Thank you.

2968
03:19:46,530 --> 03:19:47,630
Why don't you take this?

2969
03:19:48,030 --> 03:19:51,350
It isn't much, but I've been holding on to it in case I
found a friend.

2970
03:19:53,190 --> 03:20:09,710
does not do that a friend does not over another friend

2976
03:21:00,680 --> 03:21:02,780
Do I have anything to upgrade?

2977
03:21:04,600 --> 03:21:05,680
Oh, I do.

2978
03:21:06,140 --> 03:21:07,320
Oh, I have six.

Um, I'm making it too deftified.

You know, fuck it.

2981
03:21:11,640 --> 03:21:12,260
I see it now.

2982
03:21:15,000 --> 03:21:15,380
Yep.

Yeah, I'll grab another deftifiance.

2984
03:21:21,480 --> 03:21:23,160
Okay, now that I know.

2985
03:21:28,350 --> 03:21:30,230
But also take that much more.

2986
03:21:30,310 --> 03:21:31,210
Oh, I'm like basically...

2987
03:21:31,230 --> 03:21:32,530
Basically, oh, okay.

2988
03:21:35,210 --> 03:21:38,490
You ain't a random commons chaos blessing.

2989
03:21:39,350 --> 03:21:41,790
Like, does it really fully win your exilocation?

2990
03:21:46,520 --> 03:21:50,620
Okay, none of this actually matters because it's like, I'm
only alive for the...

2991
03:21:50,620 --> 03:21:50,960
You know what?

2992
03:21:51,000 --> 03:21:52,120
Yeah, let's fuck it.

2993
03:21:52,180 --> 03:21:52,920
Let's grab this.

2994
03:21:53,360 --> 03:21:56,700
I'm only alive for like three seconds anyway in here, so
let's go.

2995
03:21:57,520 --> 03:21:57,540
Commander?

2996
03:21:57,860 --> 03:21:58,620
Well, commander?

2997
03:21:58,800 --> 03:22:00,060
Yeah, where did the commander go?

2998
03:22:00,940 --> 03:22:02,180
All right, up we go.

2999
03:22:03,640 --> 03:22:03,920
Okay.

3000
03:22:04,440 --> 03:22:10,880
yeah I become a glass cannon which is basically all my runs
anyway okay it doesn't matter what we take we're just gonna

3001
03:22:10,880 --> 03:22:23,160
die too bad we couldn't scour the place before you got here
though we're right in the middle of a big shake-up fuck it

3002
03:22:23,160 --> 03:22:32,220
I'm picking whatever we're not gonna live long enough to
fucking realize what's going on like yeah so are we who are

3003
03:22:32,220 --> 03:22:34,920
we trying the pool here.

3004
03:22:35,500 --> 03:22:38,260
I literally take five steps and I get a heart attack.

3005
03:22:39,840 --> 03:22:40,540
There you go.

3006
03:22:42,440 --> 03:22:43,300
There's five steps.

3007
03:22:48,520 --> 03:22:48,580
Yep.

3008
03:22:51,260 --> 03:22:51,820
Nice.

3009
03:22:53,360 --> 03:22:56,660
Your tracks up here seem ill-advised, Militory.

3010
03:22:57,360 --> 03:22:58,880
I trust you have some sort of plan.

3011
03:22:58,960 --> 03:23:00,220
Yeah, my plan is to die.

3012
03:23:00,640 --> 03:23:01,980
Go ahead, die, repeat.

3013
03:23:03,000 --> 03:23:05,160
We're in the fucking Groundhog Day right now.

3014
03:23:06,760 --> 03:23:22,410
attacks inflict blitz I mean does it really matter what my
fucking thing does all right inside we go oh my god this

3015
03:23:22,410 --> 03:23:36,850
yeah if I can go to two one more room after this oh my god
my armor is actually saving my life right now oh my god my

3016
03:23:36,850 --> 03:23:39,110
armor is actually clutching it for me.

3017
03:23:42,430 --> 03:23:43,010
Okay, nice.

3018
03:23:45,070 --> 03:23:47,390
Oh my god, armor's almost gone.

3019
03:23:49,470 --> 03:23:49,790
Okay.

3020
03:23:51,730 --> 03:23:52,650
What the fuck is this?

3021
03:23:52,750 --> 03:23:54,130
Wait, am I supposed to destroy that?

3022
03:23:54,590 --> 03:23:58,150
Like, oh shit, is that what's summoning it for all the
creatures?

3023
03:23:58,690 --> 03:23:59,170
Oh no.

3024
03:24:00,490 --> 03:24:00,850
Yeah.

3025
03:24:02,050 --> 03:24:04,290
Oh, 29 HP.

3026
03:24:09,180 --> 03:24:09,820
Prime.

3027
03:24:09,860 --> 03:24:10,460
150.

3028
03:24:11,600 --> 03:24:12,500
Wait, what's this?

3029
03:24:12,760 --> 03:24:13,440
Oh, that's new.

3030
03:24:14,440 --> 03:24:16,360
Oh, I got this.

3031
03:24:17,360 --> 03:24:19,600
Oh, one more step and I'm down.

3032
03:24:19,860 --> 03:24:19,860
Hmm.

3033
03:24:20,500 --> 03:24:21,720
Part of the barrier is down.

3034
03:24:22,460 --> 03:24:23,940
Must have been that pylon I destroyed.

3035
03:24:25,220 --> 03:24:25,740
So what?

3036
03:24:26,120 --> 03:24:27,060
Five more to go.

3037
03:24:27,200 --> 03:24:27,660
All right.

3038
03:24:28,720 --> 03:24:29,580
Here we go.

3039
03:24:29,740 --> 03:24:31,140
10 HP and a dream.

3040
03:24:33,900 --> 03:24:36,820
Oh, never mind.

3041
03:24:40,880 --> 03:24:41,780
Oh, I forgot.

3042
03:24:41,980 --> 03:24:43,040
Oh, I should have ran to the well.

3043
03:24:43,220 --> 03:24:44,400
I forgot about the well.

3044
03:24:44,540 --> 03:24:45,900
There's to be a way I can survive up there.

3045
03:24:48,140 --> 03:24:48,620
Does that know?

3046
03:24:48,940 --> 03:24:49,840
My plants grow?

3047
03:24:50,460 --> 03:24:52,880
The air up there did not sit well with me at all.

3048
03:24:53,360 --> 03:24:54,540
What, better than I expected.

3049
03:24:54,820 --> 03:25:00,000
You who ventured into my abode shall suffer an eternity of
torment for what you have done.

3050
03:25:00,740 --> 03:25:05,840
Unless, of course, you are prepared to grant my dying wish.

3051
03:25:06,020 --> 03:25:07,380
You're already dead, Dora.

3052
03:25:09,860 --> 03:25:12,480
To name your price, I am prepared to do your bidding.

3053
03:25:12,620 --> 03:25:13,300
Yeah, what do you want?

3054
03:25:13,500 --> 03:25:14,280
You can reason anyway.

3055
03:25:15,620 --> 03:25:18,920
Then swear to me that you shall do my bidding now.

3056
03:25:20,540 --> 03:25:21,020
Specifically...

3057
03:25:21,020 --> 03:25:23,200
I haven't worked out the dying wish part yet.

3058
03:25:23,640 --> 03:25:26,100
Ask you to fetch my lover's bones.

3059
03:25:26,560 --> 03:25:27,200
Something like that.

3060
03:25:27,280 --> 03:25:28,900
Do you even know how you died, Dora?

3061
03:25:29,660 --> 03:25:30,620
Just keep me posted.

3062
03:25:30,780 --> 03:25:34,420
And then, like, in some Dora, like, the people who died
forget how they died.

3063
03:25:34,780 --> 03:25:36,300
For some, like, um...

3064
03:25:36,300 --> 03:25:37,340
Macking even so much will.

3065
03:25:37,900 --> 03:25:39,840
Merely linger in a single place.

3066
03:25:39,860 --> 03:25:47,860
for some like myths and stuff like when you die and you're
in you're in hell you don't remember how you die because you

3067
03:25:47,860 --> 03:25:57,100
go into the river that makes you forget not happening
princess i'd ask what my sister eris is doing here but then

3068
03:25:57,100 --> 03:26:06,260
they say wheresoever goes doom strife follows or the other
way around whether i like it or not has she been here long

3069
03:26:06,260 --> 03:26:11,040
some people die when they are You don't...

3070
03:26:11,040 --> 03:26:13,260
Your death is not because you got killed?

3071
03:26:14,320 --> 03:26:16,940
Murder is not the only reason people die, guys.

3072
03:26:17,020 --> 03:26:17,740
They've been trained together, though.

3073
03:26:17,760 --> 03:26:20,380
Headmistress soon gave up on her, as patient as she is.

3074
03:26:20,880 --> 03:26:21,920
I know, it's crazy.

3075
03:26:22,540 --> 03:26:24,460
The fates gave up on her as well.

3076
03:26:24,980 --> 03:26:26,560
Ordered that we never interact.

3077
03:26:26,900 --> 03:26:28,600
That I not clean her messes anymore.

3078
03:26:28,960 --> 03:26:29,480
What?

3079
03:26:29,640 --> 03:26:32,120
Although sometimes she'll go to conversation out of me.

3080
03:26:32,780 --> 03:26:35,100
I trust she hasn't made your lives too difficult.

3081
03:26:37,060 --> 03:26:37,780
I've managed.

3082
03:26:38,540 --> 03:26:39,380
You're awake.

3083
03:26:39,860 --> 03:26:40,580
Have I...

3084
03:26:40,580 --> 03:26:41,200
Oh, nice!

3085
03:26:41,840 --> 03:26:43,280
Two more planets, finished.

3086
03:26:44,960 --> 03:26:45,440
Okay.

3087
03:26:46,180 --> 03:26:47,260
I need more nightshades?

3088
03:26:48,080 --> 03:26:48,920
Or is that enough?

3089
03:26:49,840 --> 03:26:54,440
I'm not the sort to dwell too much about what the three
fates may have in store for this goddess.

3090
03:26:54,860 --> 03:26:58,200
But I do have a bit of fabric we attribute to their work.

3091
03:26:58,760 --> 03:26:59,580
Free fabric!

3092
03:26:59,780 --> 03:27:00,060
Yay!

3093
03:27:00,380 --> 03:27:01,220
I love free stuff.

3094
03:27:01,720 --> 03:27:02,380
Fate fabric.

3095
03:27:03,060 --> 03:27:06,400
Few better ways to ensure the quadrant properly conducts a
magical effect.

3096
03:27:07,000 --> 03:27:08,960
I could definitely use this if you'd be so kind.

3097
03:27:09,860 --> 03:27:12,300
Oh, I'm not a kind.

3098
03:27:12,460 --> 03:27:12,720
Yay!

3099
03:27:14,800 --> 03:27:15,200
Okay.

3100
03:27:16,960 --> 03:27:17,760
Oh, shit.

3101
03:27:18,160 --> 03:27:19,880
I ran out of Nightshade.

3102
03:27:20,920 --> 03:27:22,860
I literally just need Lightshade.

3103
03:27:23,220 --> 03:27:23,800
Or Nightshade.

3104
03:27:26,240 --> 03:27:27,540
God damn, I need one more.

3105
03:27:28,520 --> 03:27:30,060
Can I trade this for Nightshade?

3106
03:27:30,780 --> 03:27:31,060
No.

3107
03:27:31,260 --> 03:27:31,820
Fuck!

3108
03:27:32,860 --> 03:27:34,200
I literally just need...

3109
03:27:34,200 --> 03:27:35,240
This will take a little while.

3110
03:27:36,680 --> 03:27:38,780
I literally just need Nightshade.

3111
03:27:39,020 --> 03:27:39,620
That's literally it.

3112
03:27:39,860 --> 03:27:40,180
mistress.

3113
03:27:41,140 --> 03:27:45,120
Olympus seems reluctant to ask outright, but I can tell my
family there needs me.

3114
03:27:45,860 --> 03:27:49,960
I cannot shake the sense that I have to help them before I
can achieve our task.

3115
03:27:51,780 --> 03:27:55,280
You needn't shake that sense, for it may well be accurate.

3116
03:27:56,420 --> 03:28:00,600
You're still thinking of an incantation that may help you I
need you one more run.

3117
03:28:01,420 --> 03:28:04,040
I think I'll do it at the bottom and just do it.

3118
03:28:04,200 --> 03:28:05,800
Like I can just like give up, right?

3119
03:28:05,900 --> 03:28:06,600
Give up a run.

3120
03:28:06,740 --> 03:28:08,220
I'll be like a fish out of water, right?

3121
03:28:08,940 --> 03:28:09,340
Suffocating.

3122
03:28:09,860 --> 03:28:13,540
But with a proper incantation, I was thinking maybe I could
hold my breath.

3123
03:28:13,720 --> 03:28:15,080
Just hold my breath.

3124
03:28:16,960 --> 03:28:17,840
That's crazy.

3125
03:28:18,000 --> 03:28:21,020
Just don't breathe the toxic H, like O2 air.

3126
03:28:21,280 --> 03:28:23,280
I was saying just don't breathe H2O.

3127
03:28:23,640 --> 03:28:24,500
That's why.

3128
03:28:24,680 --> 03:28:26,040
Magic such as that.

3129
03:28:26,740 --> 03:28:28,420
She'll help you go farther still.

3130
03:28:31,540 --> 03:28:32,420
I'm counting on it.

3131
03:28:32,900 --> 03:28:34,880
Guys, just hold your breath.

3132
03:28:35,260 --> 03:28:37,440
Does headmistress know yet of your little excursions?

3133
03:28:38,220 --> 03:28:39,840
Not much escapes her notice last night.

3134
03:28:42,120 --> 03:28:49,920
checked strongly advise you mind your own responsibilities
hekatee doesn't control me and you should show a little you

3141

Here you go.

3142
03:29:47,060 --> 03:29:48,440
I'm picking random, guys.

3143
03:29:48,580 --> 03:29:49,580
I'm picking random.

3144
03:29:50,760 --> 03:29:51,380
Don't...

3145
03:29:51,380 --> 03:29:52,500
If I...

3146
03:29:52,500 --> 03:29:54,960
If I pick something bad, I'm picking random.

3147
03:29:56,700 --> 03:29:56,880
Okay.

3148
03:29:58,120 --> 03:29:58,660
Go.

3149
03:29:59,140 --> 03:30:00,660
We gotta get five rooms.

3150
03:30:02,520 --> 03:30:02,900
Okay.

3151
03:30:03,660 --> 03:30:05,420
I don't know what I'm picking.

3152
03:30:07,240 --> 03:30:09,120
I don't grab the money.

3153
03:30:10,680 --> 03:30:11,840
All right, Apollo.

3154
03:30:12,800 --> 03:30:14,100
No being run this time.

3155
03:30:14,980 --> 03:30:15,820
Wait, does Kronos...

3156
03:30:15,820 --> 03:30:17,100
Does the Kronos room count?

3157
03:30:18,040 --> 03:30:18,700
As a room?

3158
03:30:24,050 --> 03:30:24,610
Does it?

3159
03:30:27,780 --> 03:30:32,300
But even our Uncle Poseidon's affable veneer is a ferocity
I've learned to carefully avoid.

3160
03:30:33,160 --> 03:30:35,580
If he's backed you with his ocean strength, you're better
off.

3161
03:30:36,120 --> 03:30:36,940
Go make most of it.

3162
03:30:37,060 --> 03:30:38,720
Does the Chaos Room count as a room?

3163
03:30:40,960 --> 03:30:42,240
Your attacks deal more damage.

3164
03:30:42,480 --> 03:30:42,920
Your special.

3165
03:30:45,160 --> 03:30:46,220
All right, go in.

3166
03:30:47,900 --> 03:30:48,960
Oh, it doesn't cancel it.

3167
03:30:49,100 --> 03:30:49,580
Oh, okay.

3168
03:30:50,220 --> 03:30:51,100
So serene.

3169
03:30:52,360 --> 03:30:54,040
Oh, there's three holes now.

3170
03:30:58,640 --> 03:30:59,060
Oh, my God.

3171
03:30:59,240 --> 03:31:00,720
Just realized his arm has a face.

3172
03:31:01,060 --> 03:31:01,080
Jesus.

3173
03:31:01,340 --> 03:31:01,660
Oh, my God.

3174
03:31:01,780 --> 03:31:03,020
His arm has three faces.

3175
03:31:04,900 --> 03:31:06,140
This is so...

3176
03:31:06,140 --> 03:31:08,000
I like how his earrings is just the earth.

3177
03:31:09,520 --> 03:31:11,560
It's like earth is the only thing they care about.

3178
03:31:13,240 --> 03:31:13,680
Uh...

3179
03:31:14,480 --> 03:31:23,840
afterwards your special deal is 94 damage oh my god that's
fine i can do that uh hermes

3180
03:31:31,400 --> 03:31:43,900
i mean it's the baby level like there's no way i can not get
this it's really the baby level for babies yes so rams

3181
03:31:43,900 --> 03:31:48,960
somehow got hold of the three fates that isn't good not sure
what we can do about it m At least now everybody on Olympus

3182
03:31:48,960 --> 03:31:49,240
knows.

3183
03:31:49,480 --> 03:31:50,200
I figured it was time.

3184
03:31:50,620 --> 03:31:52,560
Got us a bit on edge, though we do hide it pretty well.

3185
03:31:53,820 --> 03:31:53,840
Alright.

3186
03:31:54,280 --> 03:31:56,400
Yeah, no more future prediction for you.

3187
03:31:58,920 --> 03:31:59,280
Okay.

3188
03:32:00,540 --> 03:32:05,260
When you stay afloat, do you have more damage with your
weapon for the next 45 seconds?

3189
03:32:06,820 --> 03:32:07,860
I mean...

3190
03:32:07,860 --> 03:32:09,520
That's really strong.

3191
03:32:11,340 --> 03:32:13,340
Bonus damage per slain flow.

3192
03:32:13,800 --> 03:32:14,120
Oh!

3193
03:32:15,320 --> 03:32:15,840
Oh!

3194
03:32:16,680 --> 03:32:17,200
Wait.

3195
03:32:17,300 --> 03:32:18,960
Yeah, that's a lot.

3196
03:32:19,280 --> 03:32:19,640
You know what?

3197
03:32:20,360 --> 03:32:20,860
Fuck it.

3198
03:32:20,920 --> 03:32:21,580
Gold tab.

3199
03:32:23,480 --> 03:32:24,500
Guys, I think I...

3200
03:32:24,500 --> 03:32:26,400
I don't know if I'm doing a good job.

3201
03:32:29,360 --> 03:32:31,300
Wait, where's the...

3202
03:32:33,100 --> 03:32:34,320
I swear to God, if I made up...

3203
03:32:34,320 --> 03:32:36,300
And then doing a god build after this.

3204
03:32:41,400 --> 03:32:42,560
Yeah, no, she is.

3205
03:32:42,600 --> 03:32:43,740
She's not a good friend.

3206
03:32:44,080 --> 03:32:47,020
She says she's our friend, but I think she's a really bad
friend.

3207
03:32:47,880 --> 03:32:58,240
If only she was more like you How humiliating that even our
booms must be concealed Like who the fuck does that plus 90%

3208
03:32:58,240 --> 03:33:01,440
damage just because I'm better than her at gaming Like

3209
03:33:06,880 --> 03:33:17,360
Yeah we'll grab that Here you are It flows your tax deal
more damage in a larger area There you go Oh fuck it let's

3210
03:33:17,360 --> 03:33:21,280
get Poseidon I might, like...

3211
03:33:21,280 --> 03:33:22,080
I don't know.

3212
03:33:22,700 --> 03:33:24,460
I don't even know if I'm doing good.

3213
03:33:30,290 --> 03:33:33,150
Like, I can't tell if my build is strong or not.

3214
03:33:34,070 --> 03:33:35,210
We'll have to do this again.

3215
03:33:37,470 --> 03:33:38,750
When you sprint, hit the foes.

3216
03:33:38,910 --> 03:33:40,210
Remove your...

3217
03:33:40,210 --> 03:33:40,730
Move McHugh.

3218
03:33:41,650 --> 03:33:42,950
Briefly restore any...

3219
03:33:42,950 --> 03:33:44,310
After your attacks...

3220
03:33:44,310 --> 03:33:46,030
After the start, attacks are special.

3221
03:33:49,900 --> 03:33:51,820
Press and hold...

3222
03:33:51,820 --> 03:33:52,760
Oh, okay.

3223
03:33:56,530 --> 03:33:57,510
All right, one.

3224
03:33:59,090 --> 03:34:00,510
All right, next your tab.

3225
03:34:02,030 --> 03:34:03,750
Just waiting for me to die.

3226
03:34:04,990 --> 03:34:05,330
Oh, hey.

3227
03:34:06,210 --> 03:34:06,490
Nice.

3228
03:34:07,530 --> 03:34:08,450
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

3229
03:34:08,790 --> 03:34:11,750
I have the thing where, like, don't I have...

3230
03:34:11,750 --> 03:34:13,630
I have blast cannon on right now, right?

3231
03:34:15,990 --> 03:34:16,750
Can't do it.

3232
03:34:17,330 --> 03:34:17,730
Wait.

3233
03:34:19,530 --> 03:34:20,570
I don't even remember.

3234
03:34:20,950 --> 03:34:22,510
I brought the last cannon, right?

3235
03:34:23,390 --> 03:34:24,810
Oh, yeah, no, I'm fucking dead.

3236
03:34:25,270 --> 03:34:26,090
Yeah, no, I'm...

3237
03:34:26,850 --> 03:34:28,110
I'm gonna die soon.

3238
03:34:29,210 --> 03:34:30,770
I legit forgot what I had.

3239
03:34:31,350 --> 03:34:32,170
No, 100%.

3240
03:34:32,170 --> 03:34:33,090
I'm gonna die soon.

3241
03:34:33,130 --> 03:34:36,950
I hate you, you can ask, but have you picked up any trace of
Zagreus by any chance?

3242
03:34:37,190 --> 03:34:38,090
Well, in your father's house?

3243
03:34:39,850 --> 03:34:40,830
Oh, yeah, I talked to him.

3244
03:34:41,010 --> 03:34:42,150
It's hard for me to say.

3245
03:34:42,730 --> 03:34:44,710
My brother isn't there, but I sense...

3246
03:34:44,710 --> 03:34:45,950
Yeah, I talked to him in the seat.

3247
03:34:46,630 --> 03:34:48,010
It's not crazy or anything.

3248
03:34:49,190 --> 03:34:50,190
Oh, I forgot to give...

3249
03:34:50,190 --> 03:34:51,190
No, I already gifted her.

3250
03:34:52,170 --> 03:34:53,190
Didn't that when she was singing?

3251
03:34:53,890 --> 03:34:54,710
He better be alright.

3252
03:34:57,830 --> 03:34:59,750
The choice is yours.

3253
03:35:00,470 --> 03:35:06,910
After you had fire seeking a arrow, you may deal critical
damage.

3254
03:35:10,420 --> 03:35:11,560
Sure, death warrant.

3255
03:35:14,060 --> 03:35:14,740
But...

3256
03:35:14,740 --> 03:35:17,280
I mean, it's 10 damage is nothing.

3257
03:35:17,960 --> 03:35:18,860
Together we shine.

3258
03:35:20,280 --> 03:35:21,100
Oh wait, what's this?

3259
03:35:24,020 --> 03:35:25,960
What the fuck was that?

3260
03:35:26,380 --> 03:35:27,320
Wait, what did I do?

3261
03:35:27,700 --> 03:35:28,780
Oh shit!

3262
03:35:28,940 --> 03:35:29,460
Oh, it's okay.

3263
03:35:30,060 --> 03:35:31,080
Receiving wretches.

3264
03:35:31,580 --> 03:35:32,320
Oh wait, nice!

3265
03:35:32,760 --> 03:35:32,760
$100.

3266
03:35:33,380 --> 03:35:33,620
Yeah!

3267
03:35:36,820 --> 03:35:39,120
My incantation must have led me to this place.

3268
03:35:39,480 --> 03:35:46,460
Deep in the endless woods of Erebus, lie secret clearings,
undiscoverable, but through supernatural means.

3269
03:35:48,220 --> 03:35:49,580
I knew we'd find this place.

3270
03:35:49,620 --> 03:35:50,000
Oh hey.

3271
03:35:50,280 --> 03:35:51,160
Oh, free water!

3272
03:35:53,740 --> 03:35:56,360
Can't tell if I have a good build or not, honestly.

3273
03:35:59,240 --> 03:36:01,880
Like, I have the glass cannon build.

3274
03:36:05,160 --> 03:36:08,340
I do do a lot of damage right now.

3275
03:36:09,120 --> 03:36:11,440
I think my plans are done, though.

3276
03:36:15,340 --> 03:36:15,740
Oh, hey.

3277
03:36:16,500 --> 03:36:17,200
Tiki time.

3278
03:36:18,200 --> 03:36:19,740
Do not be afraid.

3279
03:36:19,900 --> 03:36:21,660
I'm going to turn you into upgrades.

3280
03:36:27,540 --> 03:36:28,040
There you go.

3281
03:36:31,180 --> 03:36:35,100
Our uncle and I were just debating what to do about mortals
who turn their backs on us.

3282
03:36:35,520 --> 03:36:37,360
I think a year or so of plague should settle up.

3283
03:36:37,740 --> 03:36:37,800
Whoa.

3284
03:36:39,280 --> 03:36:40,080
A year?

3285
03:36:40,660 --> 03:36:41,660
That's pussy work.

3286
03:36:41,820 --> 03:36:42,860
Make it 10 years.

3287
03:36:43,160 --> 03:36:46,680
Make it 30 years so their kids' kids will die from the
plague.

3288
03:36:50,280 --> 03:36:51,980
Oh my god, they gave me due.

3289
03:36:52,080 --> 03:36:53,960
I might as well finish this run.

3290
03:36:56,280 --> 03:36:59,800
This run was supposed to be a throwaway run and then I got a
duo.

3291
03:37:01,620 --> 03:37:03,560
Alright, we're just gonna do it until we die.

3292
03:37:03,660 --> 03:37:04,540
Oh my god, okay.

3293
03:37:04,880 --> 03:37:06,660
We're surges ahead once you stop.

3294
03:37:07,940 --> 03:37:09,140
Now I'm fast as fuck.

3295
03:37:13,340 --> 03:37:13,820
Uh...

3296
03:37:18,130 --> 03:37:19,270
Like, I might just...

3297
03:37:19,270 --> 03:37:20,670
What the fuck is that?

3298
03:37:21,230 --> 03:37:22,370
I got a beach ball.

3299
03:37:25,570 --> 03:37:27,730
Actually, what the fuck do I have?

3300
03:37:32,180 --> 03:37:34,000
I'm so confused about this.

3301
03:37:34,540 --> 03:37:35,680
Okay, this beach ball...

3302
03:37:35,680 --> 03:37:36,580
Okay, I guess it's...

3303
03:37:36,600 --> 03:37:37,460
Oh, wait.

3304
03:37:37,520 --> 03:37:38,200
No, it's strong.

3305
03:37:38,560 --> 03:37:39,300
No, it's strong.

3306
03:37:39,620 --> 03:37:40,560
Yeah, no, that's strong.

3307
03:37:43,180 --> 03:37:46,840
I think it's like better when I'm like...

3308
03:37:46,840 --> 03:37:48,700
When I'm against the boss, I think.

3309
03:37:49,340 --> 03:37:51,600
Yeah, no, that shit is...

3310
03:37:51,600 --> 03:37:52,780
It's very strong.

3311
03:37:54,080 --> 03:37:54,520
Hammer.

3312
03:37:57,380 --> 03:37:59,420
Alright, well, we'll go until we die.

3313
03:37:59,580 --> 03:38:00,620
We'll see how this goes.

3314
03:38:01,320 --> 03:38:02,480
What a pretty nice build.

3315
03:38:04,860 --> 03:38:12,300
Your special games, your whenever you set forward restore
five I need a hose though

3316
03:38:17,800 --> 03:38:32,620
I don't know we'll grab two for the prophecy superior might
yeah there's not much glory in confronting adversaries one

3317
03:38:32,620 --> 03:38:40,360
to yeah may as well do it for the prophecy invoke shades of
the dead to alter the odds some may well favor you instead

3318
03:38:42,280 --> 03:38:49,640
Perhaps if I brought with me a legion of animal familiars
next time head mistress not that any be you just yet a

3319
03:38:49,640 --> 03:38:54,000
familiar May be of considerable benefit given all that you
have to do.

3320
03:38:54,140 --> 03:38:59,280
I mean it would be nice to have a pet To do most of the
tanking.

3321
03:38:59,680 --> 03:39:00,860
Can I just bring service a lot?

3322
03:39:03,560 --> 03:39:04,540
Jesus oh my god.

3323
03:39:04,720 --> 03:39:05,740
Okay, I broke my one armor

3324
03:39:09,600 --> 03:39:11,440
Well the armor is gone already

3325
03:39:14,680 --> 03:39:15,420
All right.

3326
03:39:18,640 --> 03:39:21,660
All right, where are the demons?

3327
03:39:22,500 --> 03:39:22,660
Boop.

3328
03:39:25,280 --> 03:39:25,760
All right.

3329
03:39:27,340 --> 03:39:28,620
Wait, where am I missing?

3330
03:39:29,340 --> 03:39:29,500
Oh.

3331
03:39:33,510 --> 03:39:34,230
Okay, I want to...

3332
03:39:34,230 --> 03:39:35,070
Oh, shit.

3333
03:39:35,170 --> 03:39:37,050
Okay, that strike thing is crazy.

3334
03:39:38,450 --> 03:39:38,970
Oh, my gosh.

3335
03:39:39,030 --> 03:39:40,030
She's almost dead already.

3336
03:39:40,330 --> 03:39:40,910
Oh, fuck.

3337
03:39:41,010 --> 03:39:41,650
I can't see.

3338
03:39:41,790 --> 03:39:42,590
It's all blue.

3339
03:39:43,350 --> 03:39:43,730
What?

3340
03:39:43,750 --> 03:39:45,410
What the fuck?!

3341
03:39:45,410 --> 03:39:47,730
I literally can't see the spell.

3342
03:39:48,990 --> 03:39:49,790
It's all blue.

3343
03:39:50,050 --> 03:39:50,890
It's just blue.

3344
03:39:52,950 --> 03:39:53,950
Okay, that's just...

3345
03:39:54,350 --> 03:39:55,510
That's just cheating.

3346
03:39:59,210 --> 03:40:01,290
My entire attack is just blue.

3347
03:40:08,480 --> 03:40:10,000
Oh my god.

3348
03:40:11,140 --> 03:40:12,600
Oh my god, she's here.

3349
03:40:14,360 --> 03:40:14,680
Yay!

3350
03:40:16,120 --> 03:40:19,360
Oh my god, my first time getting Deftified.

3351
03:40:20,340 --> 03:40:22,520
What if the spells were blue?

3352
03:40:24,200 --> 03:40:26,880
Do you bring an enemy familiar along next time?

3353
03:40:27,760 --> 03:40:29,580
If but to keep things lively for me.

3354
03:40:29,940 --> 03:40:31,380
I actually lost the Deftified.

3355
03:40:31,720 --> 03:40:33,280
Everything was just blue.

3356
03:40:37,540 --> 03:40:39,540
Faith of familiar spirits.

3357
03:40:40,320 --> 03:40:41,360
They should work on Freenos.

3358
03:40:41,540 --> 03:40:42,280
Oh, wait, nice.

3359
03:40:45,220 --> 03:40:45,520
die.

3360
03:40:45,720 --> 03:40:47,240
I don't want to play this run anymore.

3361
03:40:49,860 --> 03:40:53,960
Everything's just blue, and I think that's going to be bad
for me long term wise.

3362
03:40:55,100 --> 03:40:55,760
We'll just go.

3363
03:40:55,960 --> 03:40:56,940
We'll keep that.

3364
03:40:57,980 --> 03:41:00,420
We're just going to tank this until we're dead.

3365
03:41:02,440 --> 03:41:08,440
Here comes our shadowy assassin on her nightly escapade to
try and do... I think my build is too blue.

3366
03:41:09,260 --> 03:41:11,500
I'll be so fortunate at this time.

3367
03:41:13,400 --> 03:41:14,800
We'll soon find out, won't we?

3368
03:41:15,300 --> 03:41:17,220
I promise not to keep you waiting long.

3369
03:41:17,660 --> 03:41:21,160
I'm well on my way already as you- Oh, I keep it even if I
swap?

3370
03:41:21,680 --> 03:41:22,660
Oh, that I can.

3371
03:41:23,300 --> 03:41:25,260
Then I had best return and make ready.

3372
03:41:25,880 --> 03:41:28,220
We have to tidy up for your arrival after all.

3373
03:41:28,380 --> 03:41:29,900
Yeah, I'm coming back, but not this run.

3374
03:41:30,000 --> 03:41:31,340
I'm just gonna go die.

3375
03:41:32,380 --> 03:41:33,420
It's just too blue.

3376
03:41:34,560 --> 03:41:36,940
I mean, if I- oh, the effect will still stay?

3377
03:41:37,580 --> 03:41:41,760
I mean, fine, I'll just- I mean, fuck it.

3378
03:41:42,420 --> 03:41:44,880
Alright, I'm just gonna go tank it and die.

3379
03:41:46,160 --> 03:41:47,340
There's too much blue.

3380
03:41:51,080 --> 03:41:51,420
Alright.

3381
03:41:53,460 --> 03:41:54,520
Come at me.

3382
03:41:56,980 --> 03:41:58,180
Alright, I'll just stay here.

3383
03:41:59,540 --> 03:42:01,040
No, no, I'm not fighting.

3384
03:42:01,120 --> 03:42:01,600
I'm just here.

3385
03:42:01,680 --> 03:42:02,620
I'm just tanking this.

3386
03:42:04,000 --> 03:42:04,820
Okay, there we go.

3387
03:42:04,980 --> 03:42:05,500
There we go.

3388
03:42:06,300 --> 03:42:07,080
It's almost there.

3389
03:42:08,240 --> 03:42:10,320
This area is literally all blue.

3390
03:42:10,420 --> 03:42:11,840
I cannot deal with that.

3391
03:42:12,200 --> 03:42:14,440
I just, just one more hit.

3392
03:42:15,280 --> 03:42:15,900
There we go.

3393
03:42:16,580 --> 03:42:17,200
There we go.

3394
03:42:17,400 --> 03:42:17,520
Come on.

3395
03:42:17,600 --> 03:42:18,000
One more.

3396
03:42:19,680 --> 03:42:20,620
There we go.

3397
03:42:21,120 --> 03:42:21,920
I'm blue.

3398
03:42:26,460 --> 03:42:30,620
This fucking arena is all blue, guys.

3399
03:42:30,820 --> 03:42:32,060
I cannot deal with that.

3400
03:42:33,460 --> 03:42:35,180
At least we were in a green area.

3401
03:42:35,360 --> 03:42:36,340
But this one was just...

3402
03:42:36,340 --> 03:42:38,040
It's just everything is just blue.

3403
03:42:39,020 --> 03:42:39,520
Alright.

3404
03:42:40,980 --> 03:42:42,280
Let's make this.

3405
03:42:43,620 --> 03:42:43,780
Oh.

3406
03:42:44,080 --> 03:42:46,000
Oh, wait.

3407
03:42:46,060 --> 03:42:46,560
Where's my planet?

3408
03:42:46,580 --> 03:42:47,400
There it is.

3409
03:42:48,780 --> 03:42:48,820
Yay!

3410
03:42:49,180 --> 03:42:50,340
I got my nightshades!

3411
03:42:51,320 --> 03:42:52,360
Bye-bye, beach ball.

3412
03:42:57,980 --> 03:42:58,460
Yay!

3413
03:42:58,780 --> 03:43:00,020
I can breathe now!

3414
03:43:01,540 --> 03:43:03,080
Release me from this realm.

3415
03:43:03,440 --> 03:43:04,480
Become my key.

3416
03:43:05,180 --> 03:43:06,760
I can go to the surface!

3417
03:43:08,440 --> 03:43:11,280
Okay, we'll do a surface run on the next place through,
guys.

3418
03:43:11,380 --> 03:43:12,680
Because I actually have to go now.

3419
03:43:12,920 --> 03:43:14,220
To prep for the maid cafe.

3420
03:43:14,720 --> 03:43:15,120
But!

3421
03:43:15,400 --> 03:43:17,080
We get animals now!

3422
03:43:18,260 --> 03:43:20,040
How do I do this?

3423
03:43:20,840 --> 03:43:23,320
To all my beast companions near and far.

3424
03:43:23,520 --> 03:43:24,220
I'll get pets!

3425
03:43:25,180 --> 03:43:30,160
I can breathe oxygen!

3426
03:43:32,680 --> 03:43:33,660
Wait, what happens?

3427
03:43:35,200 --> 03:43:37,240
Give to a beast.

3428
03:43:39,420 --> 03:43:40,220
Where are they?

3429
03:43:41,720 --> 03:43:42,820
Where are the beast at?

3430
03:43:43,780 --> 03:43:45,220
Take all the time you need.

3431
03:43:46,020 --> 03:43:46,860
We'll keep it safe.

3432
03:43:49,420 --> 03:43:51,100
How do I feed them?

3433
03:43:54,580 --> 03:43:54,980
We're...

3434
03:43:54,980 --> 03:43:56,520
Oh, can I give it to Froggy?

3435
03:43:58,780 --> 03:43:59,580
Hello, Froggy.

3436
03:44:01,580 --> 03:44:01,980
Bond.

3437
03:44:02,980 --> 03:44:03,380
Oh!

3438
03:44:04,480 --> 03:44:05,560
Come with me!

3439
03:44:05,860 --> 03:44:06,940
This is a very special treat, Fritos.

3440
03:44:07,140 --> 03:44:08,180
Come with me to hell.

3441
03:44:10,080 --> 03:44:10,480
Oh.

3442
03:44:10,580 --> 03:44:11,580
Oh, you can protect me?

3443
03:44:11,580 --> 03:44:12,880
Oh, you can protect me?

3444
03:44:14,140 --> 03:44:14,540
Oh!

3445
03:44:14,900 --> 03:44:15,840
Wait, is he a tank?

3446
03:44:15,960 --> 03:44:16,880
Oh my god, I knew it.

3447
03:44:17,460 --> 03:44:18,220

come from?

3451
03:44:51,480 --> 03:44:53,120
There must be something you could tell me of my brother.

3452
03:44:53,660 --> 03:44:55,520
The stronger my connection, the better our chances.

3453
03:44:56,140 --> 03:44:57,040
You knew him, didn't you?

3454
03:44:58,140 --> 03:44:59,300
I knew your brother, yeah.

3455
03:44:59,800 --> 03:45:01,000
Good kid most of the time.

3456
03:45:01,680 --> 03:45:03,640
He wouldn't want you to be so hung up about him.

3457
03:45:04,460 --> 03:45:06,260
What he'd want more than anything.

3458
03:45:06,280 --> 03:45:07,180
Oh no, that's weird.

3459
03:45:07,400 --> 03:45:08,060
Bro, that's weird.

3460
03:45:09,880 --> 03:45:15,000
As hard as you can, repeatedly and often, and that's what I
would want for you as well.

3461
03:45:16,400 --> 03:45:18,920
Bro, that's... Bro, that's fucking weird, bro.

3462
03:45:21,140 --> 03:45:22,980
Wow, no, that's...

3463
03:45:22,980 --> 03:45:24,360
That's weird, bro.

3464
03:45:25,980 --> 03:45:26,320
Wait, no.

3465
03:45:26,460 --> 03:45:26,960
Come with me.

3466
03:45:27,780 --> 03:45:28,240
Come with me.

3467
03:45:28,300 --> 03:45:28,480
Oh!

3468
03:45:29,460 --> 03:45:30,380
Look at him!

3469
03:45:32,140 --> 03:45:33,200
Wait, how does it work?

3470
03:45:33,360 --> 03:45:34,800
Oh, does he just tank the shots?

3471
03:45:34,860 --> 03:45:36,880
Is that his purpose?

3472
03:45:38,340 --> 03:45:39,220
Oh, my God.

3473
03:45:39,260 --> 03:45:41,560
Yeah, he's definitely a masochist, for sure.

3474
03:45:41,980 --> 03:45:43,020
That's freaking weird, bro.

3475
03:45:43,620 --> 03:45:46,860
Bro, you do not take your fetishes in the work environment,
bro.

3476
03:45:46,900 --> 03:45:47,980
You put that at home.

3477
03:45:51,460 --> 03:45:54,120
Hobbs about absorbing foes that must struck.

3478
03:45:54,220 --> 03:45:56,080
Oh, I get bonus health too.

3479
03:45:57,060 --> 03:45:58,060
Bonus chance of research.

3480
03:45:58,140 --> 03:45:59,100
Oh, wait, that's insane.

3481
03:45:59,260 --> 03:46:03,600
I wonder which is, like, the best pet you can get in your
run.

3482
03:46:04,040 --> 03:46:07,880
See, this is why I did the demon runs first before I went to
the surface.

3483
03:46:08,400 --> 03:46:10,520
Because I felt like the surface is much harder.

3484
03:46:10,880 --> 03:46:15,960
So I'd rather just, like, get all the Hades stuff, the
Kronos stuff.

3485
03:46:16,420 --> 03:46:18,680
All the Kronos materials first before I go up.

3486
03:46:21,680 --> 03:46:28,820
oh he autos this oh i don't even have to dodge it i'll just
let the frog take it yeah i feel like that was like the

3487
03:46:28,820 --> 03:46:35,320
easiest i need three more runs downstairs before i can do
the upstairs runs um but anyway i'm gonna go out here like i

3488
03:46:35,320 --> 03:46:46,180
said i said that like four times but i i have to prep for
the the maid cafe stuff because you know there's a lot of

3489
03:46:46,180 --> 03:46:52,180
stuff like i have So, oh my god, there's a lot of stuff I
need to prep for it.

3490
03:46:53,660 --> 03:47:00,140
Oh, I hope I don't fumble or mess up, because I always get
really nervous seeing karaoke live.

3491
03:47:00,440 --> 03:47:04,000
Oh, especially, like, like, at a cafe.

3492
03:47:04,160 --> 03:47:04,780
I think it's different.

3493
03:47:04,860 --> 03:47:11,500
If I'm sitting on stream, it's different, but, like, for the
maid cafe, I actually have to, there's, like, a camera there

3494
03:47:11,500 --> 03:47:13,160
that shows you guys.

3495
03:47:13,280 --> 03:47:14,680
Like, I'm like, oh my god, you're real people.

3496
03:47:14,780 --> 03:47:15,220
You're not bots.

3497
03:47:15,460 --> 03:47:19,600
Like, I'm like, oh my god, there's actual...

3498
03:47:23,120 --> 03:47:23,560
faces.

3499
03:47:23,560 --> 03:47:25,400
I'm not sitting towards the screen.

3500
03:47:25,560 --> 03:47:28,300
Like, you know, when I do karaoke on stream, I look at
myself.

3501
03:47:28,440 --> 03:47:30,000
I'm like, instead, I can't look at myself.

3502
03:47:30,140 --> 03:47:31,900
I look at, I look at you guys.

3503
03:47:32,300 --> 03:47:33,600
No, not hurtful.

3504
03:47:33,700 --> 03:47:34,840
I'm just like, oh my God.

3505
03:47:35,640 --> 03:47:38,080
I'm not, you guys are real people.

3506
03:47:38,460 --> 03:47:40,540
I'm not, you're not view bots.

You're real people.

3508
03:47:41,620 --> 03:47:42,320
Oh my God.

3509
03:47:44,180 --> 03:47:46,860
It just turned off the screen, bro.

Like, yeah, so I get even more nervous like oh my god real
