1
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,860
No more loops.

2
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:35,560
No more loops.

3
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,540
We're fine now.

4
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,180
Sorry, I was trying to find a clipboard.

5
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,160
Then I got... I ran out of time to Photoshop it.

6
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,800
So I'm not a very good Amazon worker, apparently.

7
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,060
What do Amazon warehouse workers even wear?

8
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,920
Warehouse workers.

9
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:55,480
Yeah!

10
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,000
Oh, I gotta get...

11
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,160
Oh, wait, I gotta grab...

12
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,540
I gotta grab an orange vest.

13
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,200
Give me a sec.

14
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,860
I gotta be immersive, guys.

15
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,180
Orange vest.

16
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,040
PNG.

17
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,940
Guys, we gotta be immersive.

18
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:10,620
Okay?

19
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,420
It's all about the immersion.

20
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,520
I want you to feel.

21
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,880
I want you to feel the depression.

22
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:16,780
I...

23
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:22,420
I've heard a lot of horror stories working at Amazon
warehouses.

24
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,380
And I want you guys to feel like immersed.

25
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:26,620
Oh yeah.

26
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:33,160
I want you to feel the sadness and...

27
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,580
depression working in the Amazon warehouse.

28
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,760
Thank you, Doki.

29
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:45,560
You guys are like, I come to watch you to escape reality,
not bring me back.

30
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,960
Doki, no, I work at Amazon.

31
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,440
Doki, no, DOL.

32
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,020
Thank you for the super chat.

33
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:52,420
Thank you.

34
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,260
Thank you.

35
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,600
The one time I don't want to be embarrassed for no reason.

36
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:04,280
I hope there's a part in a game where you find a person in
the wrong place and have to find where I'm supposed to work.

37
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,360
No reason to say thank you to the super chat.

38
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:07,740
Thank you.

39
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,460
Thank you.

40
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:13,000
As a fellow warehouse worker, UPS though, not Amazon.

41
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,900
I honestly, like, is there really a difference?

42
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,380
Is there?

43
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:17,860
Oh yeah.

44
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:22,780
And I will promise you guys, I will not go to the bathroom
throughout this stream.

45
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,860
At least I'm unionized.

46
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,640
I welcome Doki to the world of the only fulfilling parcel
work.

47
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,760
Thank you to the super chat.

48
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,400
normal size.

49
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:33,720
Thank you.

50
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:34,420
Thank you.

51
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:35,340
Hmm.

52
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,720
Actual challenge.

53
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:38,840
Let's go.

54
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,780
If I go to the bathroom, you can deduct my pay, guys.

55
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,760
Alright, let me grab.

56
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,100
I need to grab a transparent orange vest.

57
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,860
Okay, I got it.

58
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,960
Okay, I gotta actually Photoshop this a little bit.

59
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,080
Is this orange vest orange enough?

60
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,880
Wait, is it an orange vest or is it yellow?

61
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,940
Okay, it's either.

62
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:01,080
I see orange vest more than yellow vest, so I'll go with
that.

63
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:01,380

I'm doing some Photoshop magic right now.

89
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,940
Don't, guys, guys, it's going to be so fucking immersive.

You're going to be like, whoa, which Amazon warehouse are

Okay.

00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:57,460
Wait.

101
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,280
I don't like that.

102
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,460
No web P's here.

103
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:00,220
All right.

104
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,560

I'm ready to go.

115
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,580
for my no bathroom breaks and zero union.

116
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,920
Let's go, Jeff Bezos.

117
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,760
It's too real.

118
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,900
No, no, no.

119
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,140
Okay, I got my orange vest.

120
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,280
Hello, everyone.

121
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,720
My name is Dokey.

122
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,820
I'm new here.

123
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,320
And I'm ready to make Jeff Bezos another $5 billion.

124
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,320
Let's go.

125
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:36,800
CEO, entrepreneur, born in 1964, Jeffree.

126
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:46,580
Jeffrey Bezos, CEO, entrepreneur, born in 1964, Jeffrey,
Jeffrey Bezos.

127
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,520
That's our national anthem whenever we clock in at the
warehouse.

128
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,020
Only $5 billion.

129
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,200
How dare you?

130
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,800
Jeffrey is going to be so disappointed.

131
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,960
I'm sorry, Jeffrey.

132
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,300
I'm sorry.

133
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:07,740
$1 billion short.

134
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:08,880
I'm so sad.

135
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,300
To boost morale.

136
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,340
You sound too happy.

137
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,460
It's my first day.

138
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,340
The light is still in my eyes.

139
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,900
It's just my first day, guys.

140
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,460
Don't worry.

141
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:30,100
They'll squash the fire in my eyes very soon.

142
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,580
Yeah, we need to come on Christmas Day.

143
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,900
We're shorthanded.

144
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:38,840
All right, here we go.

145
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,440
You think he's actually going to be at our warehouse, guys?

146
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,260
Oh, my God.

147
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,200
I can't wait to see Jeffrey at our warehouse.

148
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,020
All right, let's see.

149
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,120
At my particular warehouse.

150
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,080
All right.

151
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:51,620
Sound guy.

152
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,600
I don't know if you're alive.

153
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,900
Sinica, welcome to Tomato Farm.

154
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:56,780
Welcome, welcome.

155
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,460
She still has hope.

156
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,200
Get her.

157
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:00,400
All right.

158
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,400
At least they did most.

159
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:01,700
Okay.

160
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,540
You know what?

161
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,160
I got to have at least 180 frames.

162
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,880
I got to make sure I sort the parcels correctly, guys.

163
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,820
Guys, I gotta make sure.

164
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,580
Alright, I mean, I feel like the sensitivity is fine.

165
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,560
Alright, here we go.

166
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,600
Apparently this game is very addicting.

167
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,080
From what I saw in chat.

168
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,060
Not the reviews, but from people in chat that were talking
about it.

169
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,300
Alright, here we go.

170
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,040
It's my first day at work.

171
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:29,940
Let's go.

00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:31,380
Whoa.

00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:35,140
I live in the storage department.

174
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,440
It's not sad at all.

175
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,200
Gotta make enough for it.

Your mission to choose except, spoiler you did, is to ensure
every parcel gets the red carpet treatment.

218
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,640
Here's a typical day in the warehouse.

219
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,640
Pick a parcel from the delivery door.

220
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,920
Inspect parcel labels for issue.

221
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:28,860
Attach an approval denial inspection sticker to the parcel.

222
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:35,400
Finally submit them at either the export door for valid
parcel or the return shoot for invalid parcel.

223
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:42,820
Fetch parcels from the delivery door at the far side of the
warehouse and inspect them at this inspection table.

224
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:47,420
Then submit them as valid or invalid based on the set of
ever-changing criteria.

225
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:52,020
Go to the sidebar to discover your criteria.

00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:44,310
Okay.

525
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:47,730
I see the vision, Mr. Bezos.

526
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:48,710
I see it.

527
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:50,390
Okay.

528
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:52,710
Strandum.

529
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,050
Wait, is that the right?

530
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:57,430
It's not the right one, is it?

531
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:00,630
Wait, I gotta...

532
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,980
Okay, it's brown.

533
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:10,000
How the fuck do you get that incorrect?

534
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,760
Oh, it is brown.

Alright, truck.

I gotta be able to do this a little bit faster.

538
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,780
Cheerful messages from companies somehow feel worse than the
rude ones would.

539
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,900
And thank you for the super chat.

No pain, no gain, exactly.

We're at a company.

Amazon office.

551
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,660
Alright, here you go.

552
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:36,780

00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:44,440
Yay.

558
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,100
Hard worker is a good worker.

559
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,420
It's a happy worker, too.

560
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:51,520
All right.

561
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:52,460
Strand town.

562
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:52,860
Oh, my God.

563
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,660
Eventually, I'm going to remember what the flags.

564
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:55,760
All right.

565
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:56,780
By train.

00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:57,520
Yeah.

567
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,820
Is that the right?

568
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,580
Okay, it is.

569
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:02,720
I don't know.

570
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,920
It feels like they're going to fuck with me.

571
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:04,460
Oh, my God.

572
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:08,340

Who said that?

580
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:21,160
If my hero doesn't have unions, do you think you're better
than Mr. Bezos?

581
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,560
Do you think you're better than him?

582
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,320
Um, Mr. Bezos is a billionaire's.

583
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:35,660
And, oh, of course, and if he's a billionaire, that means he
knows what's right.

584
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:36,860
Right?

585
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,000

Thank you, thank you.

593
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,800
Well, the thing is, one is still alive.

594
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,180
And he's recently single.

595
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:24,700
Guys, there is.

596
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,500
Guys, we all have a chance, guys.

597
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,060
We all have a chance.

598
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,240
Oh, that's not the right flag.

599
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,200

600
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,480
There's hope for all of us.

00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:45,180

00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:45,720
Yeah.

604
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:51,780
His ex-wife got, like, hundreds of billions of dollars, but
she's donating it all to charity.

605
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,980
I don't know what Mr. Basil is doing.

606
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:56,860
It was like, but I know he's doing a great job.

607
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:00,500

Like, we have offered those services.

613
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:13,280
You know, maybe it's, like, by time travel or some shit.

614
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,960
I gotta make sure we offer time travel or not.

615
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,040
You don't know that.

616
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,360
Maybe we do.

617
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:23,220
Maybe we offer time travel.

618
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,580
The time wizard is shipping my package.

619
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,400
Oh, wait, I have enough.

620
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,260
Oh, my God.

00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,620
I got the weight class now.

622
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,060
Yeah, but if I buy this, it'll make it harder.

623
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:35,960
But I do...

624
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,540
Oh, I get more.

625
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,900
I get paid more, though.

626
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:38,720
Alright.

627
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,680
I got weight class now.

628
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,100

00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,920
Uh, five more parcels.

630
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:47,480
Uh, Linux.

631
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:48,760
Welcome to the tomato farm.

632
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,620
Welcome, welcome.

633
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,800
That will explain the same.

634
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:53,880
No, that's just our drones.

635
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:54,720
Uh, not.

636
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,140
Wait, John Othia?

637
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,520
That's not John Othia.

638
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,160
I would recognize.

639
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,620
Yeah, that's not John Othia.

640
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,040
It must be an easier way to...

641
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,440
Oh, wait, it came in pre- Oh, sorry, I just didn't trust
David from down the hall, you know?

642
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:15,420
He was hired, like, uh, 10 seconds after me.

643
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:19,660
And, like, you know, I, clearly I have more experience than
David from down the hall.

644
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,640
All right, let's see.

645
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,520
You made the perfect choice.

646
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,380
All right, here we go.

647
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,780
Oh, it's already came in.

648
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,200
All right, there we go.

649
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,380
Oh, when does my, when does my workday stop?

650
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:35,200
All right.

651
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,320
Johnathia.

652
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,660
Okay, I remember Johnathia.

653
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,000
I have to look just to be... Okay, there you go.

654
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:41,780
Alright.

655
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,480
Approve.

656
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,420
There you go.

657
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,680
And then we put that.

658
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:51,760

00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:56,580
Submit.

661
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,840
He doesn't offer overtime, which makes sense, you know?

662
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:00,940
Makes sense.

663
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:02,740
Why do we need overtime?

664
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:07,540
We get paid just enough money like once a week.

665
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,860
Investigate the contracts room.

666
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,140

Oh, my God.

00:47:58,020 --> 00:47:59,220
I didn't even need to weigh this.

743
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:01,240

744
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:01,980
Wait.

745
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:03,020

00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:04,980
Okay, we don't.

Maybe.

750
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:11,960
Maybe it's someone sending this package to the prisons, you

755
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:25,100
It's got to be sure we offer the services.

Our new prison service.

00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:33,400
What if they're sending a file to the local jail?

759
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:35,920

00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,120
I fucking hate that now.

774
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:09,660
Everyone uses the AI phones.

775
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:13,580
Like the AI, like, call sheet.

776
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:15,400
Okay.

777
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:18,760
All right.

778
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,640
Which one?

779
00:50:28,510 --> 00:50:29,130

Okay, okay.

782
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,000
First time.

783
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:38,540
This is my first mistake, guys.

784
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:39,400
Oh, no.

785
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:40,260
They marked me.

786
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:41,480
They marked me.

787
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:42,900
I'm sorry.

788
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:44,800
I thought her granny wasn't real.

789
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:49,680
They literally announced independence like five, like five
minutes ago.

790
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,220
Not terminally online.

791
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:53,360
Mr. Bezos.

792
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:58,640
All I've been doing is just working in this, in this sorting
facility.

793
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:04,920
Okay, 13.

794
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,720
Wait, 13.56.

795
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,280
Yeah, that's a C.

796
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:12,820
Right?

797
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:15,160
I got, I'm going to read, I'm going to read scale this.

798
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:16,700
I got to make sure.

799
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:21,520
The C says a B, but like, okay, 13.

800
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:21,940
Yeah.

801
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,420
And I got to be sure.

802
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:25,480
I gotta be sure.

803
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:27,280
I already have one strike.

804
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:30,440
Denial.

805
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,220
I can't believe Doki lost my order.

806
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,640
No, no, it's not my fault.

807
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,380
It's not my fault.

808
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:42,180
You guys, your country announced independence five minutes
ago.

809
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,460
I didn't know.

810
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:46,160
I gotta make sure.

811
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:46,920
I'm gonna submit this.

812
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:47,860
I'm paranoid now.

813
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,640
Okay, I got the right one.

814
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:53,600
Yeah, there's no time to learn new geography.

815
00:51:56,820 --> 00:52:05,020
Okay, Yadda, Nika, Yadda, okay.

816
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:09,260
All right, I'll check your package weight now.

817
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,680
I'll make sure you sorted that correctly.

818
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:15,620
All right.

819
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,160
And then, yeah, zero.

820
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:19,220
Okay, that's good.

821
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:22,640
All right, someone's getting their Christmas present this
week.

822
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:23,460

823

Okay, D.

It's part of regulation, Doki.

873
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:20,640

933
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:23,540
anything, but, like, this might be, I don't know, I might be
crazy, but, do you think this might be a bit too much work

934
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:24,600
for one person?

935
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:28,360

They dare question him.

942
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:04,920
I'm scared to see you focusing on proving company profits by
expanding the warehouse, even at the detriment to your own

943
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:05,500
sanity.

944

976
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:40,960
Okay, C is...

It's a little overweight, ma'am.

981
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:50,500

01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:54,260

Okay, that's fine.

985
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,080

986
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:00,940

I don't even know if there's a weight above 30.

998
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:22,280
Okay, yeah, that's fine.

999
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:23,520
Alright, we gotta put this.

Look at that.

1050
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:19,200

1051
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:20,900
Down to the T.

1052
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:22,700

I forgot about that.

1072
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:13,700
Multiple deliveries at once with a pallet.

1073
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:15,320
Okay, we don't need to buy a pallet.

1074
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:16,680
Okay, we gotta get...

1075
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:18,300
A serial number.

1076
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:20,240
Oh, okay.

1077
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:22,860

We gotta reject that.

1144
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:35,340
Should I pay it extra?

1145
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:38,200
Should I pay it extra?

1146
01:11:41,220 --> 01:11:43,220
Your first baby's not gonna have a first...

Goodbye.

1149
01:11:46,580 --> 01:11:47,380
Burning that...

1150
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:50,140
We're gonna burn that package specifically, too.

1151
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:50,780
Oh, nice.

1152
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:54,540
Prove of...

1153
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:55,380
And rejection.

1154
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:57,700
I didn't check the...

1155
01:11:57,700 --> 01:11:59,000
I didn't check whether it's played.

1156
01:11:59,080 --> 01:11:59,640
Oh, fuck.

1157
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:00,240
Okay, it's fine.

1158
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:03,020
Oh shit, okay.

1159
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:07,900
That won't be a problem.

1160
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:12,040
I'm just gonna send this out, hoping that that's not my
plane.

1161
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:14,040
Okay, thank God.

1162
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:17,040
I was like, oh, that's my plane.

1163
01:12:17,260 --> 01:12:18,260
That's unfortunate.

1164
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:22,800
The Vokua.

1165
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:26,740
I keep forgetting what the country flags look like.

1166
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:28,900
This is a problem.

1167
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:30,500
Okay.

1168
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:33,440
It's okay, we were gonna burn that package anyway.

1169
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:34,980
I put 9.3.

1170
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:37,180
Okay, see, this guy was willing to pay extra.

1171
01:12:42,330 --> 01:12:45,210
He was willing to pay extra, even though he didn't need it.

1172
01:12:46,930 --> 01:12:48,530
Is there any already approved ones?

1173
01:12:50,610 --> 01:12:51,490
Okay, congrati.

1174
01:12:54,410 --> 01:12:57,730
I feel like it's just harder to memorize, like, countries
that aren't real.

1175
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:02,630
Oh, my God.

We don't offer that yet.

1181
01:13:39,330 --> 01:13:40,670
We don't have by rocket ship.

1182
01:13:40,810 --> 01:13:41,510
I'm so sorry.

1183
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:44,670

By air.

1190
01:13:56,850 --> 01:13:57,290
Seed.

1191
01:13:57,290 --> 01:13:59,270
I think that's the right country flag.

1192
01:13:59,750 --> 01:14:02,810
Yeah, if the triangle is up, for some reason, Ligbo...

1193
01:14:03,330 --> 01:14:07,250
It's the one that I remember for the country flag.

1194
01:14:11,670 --> 01:14:12,310
15.

1195
01:14:13,330 --> 01:14:14,230
That's 15.

1196
01:14:14,330 --> 01:14:15,130
What was this here?

1197
01:14:15,590 --> 01:14:17,310
Oh, just 0.5 cage.

1198
01:14:17,470 --> 01:14:19,630
Yeah, we were just off.

1199
01:14:22,730 --> 01:14:23,430

01:14:24,510 --> 01:14:28,390
Okay, so this is full now.

1201
01:14:28,650 --> 01:14:28,930
Alright.

1202
01:14:29,510 --> 01:14:29,830
It's okay.

1203
01:14:29,870 --> 01:14:31,130
It's just my one mistake.

1204
01:14:37,700 --> 01:14:38,180
Ooh.

1205
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:39,000

It's okay.

1207
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:44,300
It's just two mistakes, guys.

1208
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:49,600
Okay, that one was correct.

1209
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:51,000
Okay, it's okay, guys.

1210
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:52,000
It's just two.

1211
01:14:52,140 --> 01:14:53,040
It's just two.

1212
01:14:53,180 --> 01:14:55,860
I don't know when the two mistakes came from.

1213
01:14:55,940 --> 01:14:57,820
Where the second one came from.

1214
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:04,140
I don't know where the second one came from, okay?

1215
01:15:05,980 --> 01:15:07,180

That seems correct.

1222
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:40,440
Buy a truck.

1223
01:15:41,260 --> 01:15:41,540
Alright.

1224
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:43,760
Ooh, this one's heavy, heavy.

1225
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:47,040
18.

1226
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:48,200
Never mind.

1227
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:49,240
He just paid extra.

1228
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:52,580
I don't believe we just do that.

1229
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:54,600
Wait.

1230
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:55,920
Car, truck.

1231
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:57,460
Yeah, we do trucks.

1232
01:15:58,220 --> 01:15:58,820
I just got it.

1233
01:15:58,860 --> 01:16:00,440
I'm like more paranoid now.

1234
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:01,960
Congrati.

1235
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:02,920
Wait, that's not right.

1236
01:16:06,790 --> 01:16:07,310
Yeah.

1237
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:08,770
I've done so many congrats.

1238
01:16:08,930 --> 01:16:10,090
I was like, you don't have a star.

1239
01:16:10,250 --> 01:16:10,810
It's a circle.

1240
01:16:11,970 --> 01:16:13,170
See, I remember congrats.

1241
01:16:14,850 --> 01:16:16,810
That wrong flag, sir.

1242
01:16:17,450 --> 01:16:18,030
Wrong flag.

1243
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,660
Alright, that one's already denied.

1244
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:25,460
It's a freebie.

1245
01:16:28,060 --> 01:16:28,560
Alright.

1246
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:30,820
Oh, God, I need another conveyance, bro.

1247
01:16:31,940 --> 01:16:33,420
Can't keep going back and forth.

1248
01:16:33,540 --> 01:16:34,440
Oh, another freebie.

1249
01:16:34,540 --> 01:16:35,160
Let's go!

1250
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:37,820
Good Jeffrey sees all.

1251
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:45,200
He has cameras everywhere, especially in the bathroom,
because we're not supposed to go in there.

1252
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:50,380
The bathrooms are only reserved for Mr. Bezos when he comes
over to inspect.

1253
01:16:54,660 --> 01:16:55,120
Stratom.

1254
01:16:56,940 --> 01:16:57,600
That seems right.

1255
01:16:57,660 --> 01:16:57,920
Oh, wait.

1256
01:16:57,960 --> 01:16:58,440
It's my time.

1257
01:16:58,660 --> 01:16:58,860
Never mind.

1258
01:16:59,660 --> 01:17:00,600
It's still my time.

1259
01:17:00,740 --> 01:17:02,020
That's my time travel.

1260
01:17:02,220 --> 01:17:03,820
We haven't invented that one yet.

1261
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:07,920
Oh, wait.

1262
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:08,500
Let me...

1263
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:08,740
Oh, wait.

1264
01:17:08,740 --> 01:17:10,820
I can finally buy another computer.

1265
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:11,600
conveyor belt.

1266
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:14,260
Oh, check out.

1267
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:18,600
Johnathia.

1268
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:21,300
Okay, I'll do this one.

1269
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:23,260
Because this one's by a rocky ship.

1270
01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:24,680
I can deny it right now.

1271
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:29,120
There you go.

1272
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:29,820
Kobe!

1273
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:31,840
Oh, this one was very heavy.

1274
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:32,360
It's okay.

1275
01:17:32,620 --> 01:17:35,780
It's fine dropping it because the guy's not even going to
get his package anyway.

1276
01:17:37,580 --> 01:17:39,700
He's not going to get it anyway, so it's fine.

1277
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:41,440
Johnathia.

1278
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:45,360
Okay.

1279
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:48,240
It should be fun.

1280
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:48,940
There's no...

1281
01:17:48,940 --> 01:17:50,860
I haven't seen a package that's, like, over here.

1282
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:51,240
You know what?

1283
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:53,500
Every time I see an E one, I'll just print approval.

1284
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:54,620
Oh, wait.

1285
01:17:54,620 --> 01:17:56,500
I forgot to check a flag.

1286
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:57,420
I was so confident.

1287
01:17:57,920 --> 01:17:58,560
Oh, I knew.

1288
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,180
There's a reason to be confident, because it was correct.

1289
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:06,800
And this one is...

1290
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:07,340
Prunia.

1291
01:18:07,460 --> 01:18:08,180
Okay, Prunia.

1292
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:10,360
I remember Prunia.

1293
01:18:10,940 --> 01:18:13,520
Yeah, that's a Prunia fat flag right there.

1294
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:16,720
Okay, C.

1295
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:18,260
Prunia.

1296
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:22,040
Yeah, no fragile icon, too.

1297
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:26,480
6.26.

1298
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:27,680
Wait.

1299
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:30,660
Yeah, that's fine.

1300
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:33,780
Print approval!

1301
01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:37,580
Boom!

1302
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:39,080
Oh, go up!

1303
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:43,160
Okay.

1304
01:18:48,700 --> 01:18:51,400
You're going to get your Christmas present.

1305
01:18:51,980 --> 01:18:52,220
Kylo.

1306
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:54,420
Kylo, don't worry.

1307
01:18:57,260 --> 01:18:58,260
Don't worry.

1308
01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:00,120
Yeah!

1309
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:02,720
We did it, Kylo.

1310
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:04,460
Let's go.

1311
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:10,700
Let's hope there's nothing fragile in there.

1312
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:13,200
Into the square hole you go.

1313
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:15,800
Alright.

1314
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:16,940
My present.

1315
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:21,980
This is the most accurate part so far.

1316
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:25,120
Alright, nice.

1317
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:26,900
I got this one, too.

1318
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:30,100
Yeah.

1319
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:32,220
There we go.

1320
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:32,620
Yeah!

1321
01:19:33,220 --> 01:19:35,460
Oh, a serial number keypad.

1322
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:37,860
What do I need that for?

1323
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:42,160
Paste it.

1324
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:43,840
What do I do with it?

1325
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:46,040
Oh, I need the license for it?

1326
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:48,100
Am I licensed?

1327
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:52,080
Yeah, but I have it right here.

1328
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:01,620
Where do I put this?

1329
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:05,260
You'll need to key in Sierra numbers.

1330
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:05,820
What?

1331
01:20:06,780 --> 01:20:07,360
Why?

1332
01:20:11,660 --> 01:20:12,820
What's the point?

1333
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:16,260
Guys, it's not boobs.

1334
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:18,720
What's the point?

1335
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:22,300
Oh!

1336
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:25,040
They confirm their validity now?

1337
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:27,120
Oh my god, but I do get paid more this time.

1338
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:28,720
I'm a new email.

1339
01:20:31,940 --> 01:20:34,200
What's the parcel inspector's favorite herb?

1340
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:34,900
Parsley.

1341
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:38,400
Well done for being proactive in purchasing.

1342
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:41,080
It's nice to finally get the cares about making their boss
more money.

1343
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:42,040
Of course, sir!

1344
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:45,120
For an extra delivery, check parcel seal.

1345
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:48,520
Oh my god.

1346
01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:52,140
Okay, yes, I'm the one man army, sir.

1347
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:56,040
Oh my god.

Okay.

1349
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:57,260
It's five.

1350
01:20:57,580 --> 01:20:58,540
It's day five.

1351
01:20:58,700 --> 01:21:00,760
Look at that in five days.

1352
01:21:04,340 --> 01:21:06,140
In five days.

1353
01:21:06,180 --> 01:21:07,640
Guys, I'm getting promoted.

1354
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:10,520

Look at that.

1357
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:19,980
I got a promotion.

1358
01:21:24,580 --> 01:21:27,900

each valid parcel helping our shareholders make more money

The shareholders know what the people want?

1364
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:09,740
Yay!

Okay, how much is tier two?

Okay, it's okay.

4-8-1-9-2.

1381
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:42,140
Why are they all invalid?

1382
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:44,340
Oh, it's because it's my fault.

1383

But I too.

1384
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:49,940
Guys, this is why the robot's gonna take over, guys.

1385
01:23:51,940 --> 01:23:54,780
There's a lot of human error going on here.

1386
01:23:55,980 --> 01:23:57,780
All right, this should be fine.

1387
01:23:58,900 --> 01:23:59,380
There you go.

1388
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:00,160
Approves.

1389
01:24:00,820 --> 01:24:01,140
Nope.

1390
01:24:02,700 --> 01:24:04,300
Oh, they're not accepting it today.

1391
01:24:04,580 --> 01:24:05,660
All right, there you go.

1392
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:08,240
People, thank you for the super chat.

1393
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:08,560
Thank you.

1394
01:24:08,660 --> 01:24:09,420
Thank you.

1395
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:13,060
Okay, I feel like I have to do zero number first.

1396
01:24:13,740 --> 01:24:14,420
Wait, is that real?

1397
01:24:14,580 --> 01:24:15,420
That looks like a...

1398
01:24:15,420 --> 01:24:16,640
Okay, no, that's not a real flag.

1399
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:22,320
Wait, actually, I'll do country flag first, because I was
like, that does not look like...

1400
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:24,740
Yeah, I was gonna say, congrats flag is a fucking...

1401
01:24:25,820 --> 01:24:26,380
Circle.

1402
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:29,020
That's, like, the only flag I've processed.

It's a tiny one.

1408
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:38,320
It's an envelope.

1409
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:41,640
Oh, it's for Yacht Tanika, too.

1410
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:44,140
We actually need that for the last contract.

1411
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:45,820

01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:49,240

You're right.

1422
01:25:38,580 --> 01:25:40,040
Maybe I should place this closer.

1423
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:43,940

01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:44,660

01:25:56,100 --> 01:26:00,560
7, 7, 7, 8, 2, 3, 4, 2, 4.

01:26:01,060 --> 01:26:01,900
Okay, it's valid.

1431
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:06,340
And then I know, because it's E-weight, so they...

1432
01:26:07,820 --> 01:26:09,160
So this should be fine.

1433
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:10,200
We'll get a story of this.

1434
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:12,180
There you go.

1435
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:13,900
Yeah, they're never, yeah, that's right.

1436
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:16,940
You'll never know if you got accepted or not.

1437
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:19,040
Oh, it's a knight.

1438
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:19,860
That's good.

1439
01:26:21,420 --> 01:26:22,840
I don't have to worry about this.

1440
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:26,640
letters on.

1441
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:36,060
It's like those like super exclusive universities where they
don't even, you can't even check online because they want to

1442
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:36,580
be real.

1443
01:26:36,700 --> 01:26:37,740
They want to be authentic.

1444
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:40,540
Is that a C?

1445
01:26:42,460 --> 01:26:44,360
Do I have a C on my keyboard?

1446
01:26:45,620 --> 01:26:46,560
What the fuck?

1447
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:49,120
That is not a number, right?

1448
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:56,800
I just, I just want to be sure, but they add the letter C
into it because I'm not, I didn't, checked social media

1449
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:57,480
today.

1450
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:07,260
I just want to be sure if they added the letter C into the
number system, you know?

1451
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:09,240
Oh my god, I fucked up.

1452
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:11,460
My keypad is underneath the table now.

1453
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:15,080
I gotta fix this.

1454
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:18,940
Okay.

1455
01:27:22,020 --> 01:27:23,760
New number just dropped.

1456
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:29,120
I want to know if they, like, it's like how they
recategorize, like Pluto to me, not a it and then like did

1457
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:40,500

felt right you know i think yeah it's just i just want to be

1458
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:43,400

1459
01:27:47,950 --> 01:28:01,610

eight four three five eight four Okay, it's valid.

1460
01:28:02,690 --> 01:28:05,710
Well, okay, it's E, so it's like the heaviest one.

1461
01:28:06,190 --> 01:28:06,490
All right.

1462
01:28:06,750 --> 01:28:08,650
Oh, we finally finished the contract, though.

1463
01:28:12,910 --> 01:28:13,470

Oh, that's...

1470
01:28:42,290 --> 01:28:43,850

Let's see, we're at the 25.

1472
01:28:53,130 --> 01:28:54,210
It's fine.

1473
01:28:55,090 --> 01:28:56,330
It's... It's fine.

1474
01:28:56,650 --> 01:28:57,510
It's a little awkward.

1475
01:29:04,090 --> 01:29:04,770
Okay.

1476
01:29:05,130 --> 01:29:05,690

1834
01:53:29,540 --> 01:53:31,600
I'm learning the forbidden technique.

1835
01:53:31,980 --> 01:53:33,860

01:53:36,820 --> 01:53:37,380

That's it.

1863
01:56:09,390 --> 01:56:11,570
They don't know if they's mishandled.

1864
01:56:13,510 --> 01:56:17,050
Maybe the truck was going through some potholes, you know?

1865
01:56:19,110 --> 01:56:20,150
Any congratulants?

1866
01:56:21,290 --> 01:56:21,790

Just Zigbo.

1868
01:56:25,490 --> 01:56:27,210
Okay, we'll put the weight on first.

1869
01:56:30,470 --> 01:56:31,150
Zero to 15.

1870
01:56:34,270 --> 01:56:35,350
Okay, that's fine.

1871
01:56:36,250 --> 01:56:37,510
And then we'll scan it.

1872
01:56:39,210 --> 01:56:39,330
Oh.

1873
01:56:41,390 --> 01:56:42,650
Okay, that's good.

1874
01:56:43,230 --> 01:56:44,950
And then the flag is correct.

1875
01:56:46,090 --> 01:56:47,370
And then we got another one.

1876
01:56:49,690 --> 01:56:51,850
Oh my god, this is a huge payday.

1877
01:56:51,910 --> 01:56:52,310

plane and it's still gonna take longer I think that's the

1897
01:58:24,090 --> 01:58:31,510
worst part they all paid extra that have the deliveries by
plane because they thought it was faster.

1898
01:58:32,290 --> 01:58:34,010
Little do they know.

1899
01:58:38,350 --> 01:58:41,330
We only deliver by plane once a week, apparently.

1900
01:58:42,570 --> 01:58:43,050
Oh, my God.

1901
01:58:43,130 --> 01:58:44,590
No, I don't think he'll give me free time.

1902
01:58:44,750 --> 01:58:47,250
That's asking way too much from Mr. Bezos.

1903
01:58:53,230 --> 01:58:54,550

My grandmother's ashes should have arrived two months ago,
but they're still in transit.

1909
01:59:04,350 --> 01:59:12,790
Can you please provide us your ID number so we can go check

01:59:13,430 --> 01:59:15,850
Press one if you would like to...

1912
01:59:19,710 --> 01:59:20,590
Press two if you'd like...

And then you're going to be on that phone call for seven
hours.

1919

1923
01:59:58,070 --> 02:00:00,230
What the fuck do you mean?

1924
02:00:01,390 --> 02:00:03,550
It was always Blaine Day!

1925
02:00:07,970 --> 02:00:10,810
When did it not become Blaine Day?

1926
02:00:12,110 --> 02:00:12,750
Normal.

1927
02:00:13,110 --> 02:00:14,350

Oh, that is approved.

1932
02:00:26,370 --> 02:00:27,310

It's now Boat Day.

1936
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:37,320
The planes are on strike right now.

1937
02:00:41,420 --> 02:00:41,820
Eh.

1938
02:00:45,630 --> 02:00:46,150
Nine.

1939
02:00:46,550 --> 02:00:47,490
It's overweight.

1940
02:00:50,530 --> 02:00:51,590
Planes are on strike.

1941
02:00:51,670 --> 02:00:53,890
They're having to own those CSs right now.

1942
02:00:58,680 --> 02:00:59,100
All right.

1943
02:01:01,900 --> 02:01:02,420
B.

1944
02:01:03,820 --> 02:01:04,760
What the fuck?

1945
02:01:04,880 --> 02:01:06,000
Okay, 0 out of 10.

1946
02:01:06,180 --> 02:01:07,340
Okay, that's 5.

1947
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:09,880
Okay, it's by burger.

1948
02:01:10,160 --> 02:01:10,800
Never mind.

1949
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:13,160
Denied.

1950
02:01:14,380 --> 02:01:15,720
You don't do it by burger.

1951
02:01:16,960 --> 02:01:17,360
Normal size.

1952
02:01:17,460 --> 02:01:18,360
Thank you for the super chat.

1953
02:01:18,460 --> 02:01:18,660

02:01:18,660 --> 02:01:19,100
Thank you.

1955
02:01:19,380 --> 02:01:21,200
Doki, your work has been phenomenal this month.

1956
02:01:23,380 --> 02:01:24,420
I sure appreciate it.

1957
02:01:24,420 --> 02:01:25,640
Will be doubling your workload.

1958
02:01:25,940 --> 02:01:26,340
Pay increase?

1959
02:01:26,860 --> 02:01:28,340
Well, about that.

1960
02:01:30,280 --> 02:01:32,280
Do you not love the company, Doki?

1961
02:01:33,840 --> 02:01:37,700
If you love the company, you won't need to be paid more to
do what you love.

1962
02:01:42,370 --> 02:01:43,890
Oh wait, this is approved.

1963
02:01:49,120 --> 02:01:49,960
By train.

1964
02:01:50,820 --> 02:01:51,600
I did a flip.

1965
02:01:58,180 --> 02:01:58,220
Okay.

1966
02:01:58,820 --> 02:01:59,180

02:02:02,340 --> 02:02:03,200
Yeah, that's good.

1969
02:02:04,360 --> 02:02:07,020
Oh my god, I finally scanned stuff.

1970
02:02:09,580 --> 02:02:11,000
Okay, that's approved.

1971
02:02:14,420 --> 02:02:15,040
There we go.

1972
02:02:15,260 --> 02:02:15,820
By truck.

1973
02:02:15,920 --> 02:02:16,380
Here we go.

1974
02:02:18,500 --> 02:02:18,720

Wait, is that invalid?

1980
02:02:54,400 --> 02:02:55,540
Okay, it is.

1981
02:02:56,420 --> 02:02:57,420
But she's gonna die.

02:02:58,540 --> 02:02:58,780
Alright.

02:03:08,620 --> 02:03:10,100
There's no fragile sticker.

1987
02:03:10,200 --> 02:03:11,060
I could do this.

1988
02:03:13,040 --> 02:03:20,160
Look, if they didn't want me to throw your packages around,
then why the fuck did you not put a fragile sticker on?

02:05:11,780 --> 02:05:17,340
Like the longer I work the process gets too real.

2000
02:05:18,920 --> 02:05:25,760
Is there one that's like obviously not a real delivery?

Okay, they're all real.

2002
02:05:29,940 --> 02:05:35,620
And the more real it becomes.

2003
02:05:38,300 --> 02:05:40,880
All these packages I have out.

2004
02:05:42,040 --> 02:05:44,040
I figured out the system, guys.

2005
02:05:44,760 --> 02:05:45,880
Oh, it got approved.

2006
02:05:46,760 --> 02:05:47,180
Nice.

2007
02:05:49,620 --> 02:05:51,580
She's integrating too quickly.

2008
02:05:53,340 --> 02:05:54,980
She's becoming self-aware.

2009
02:05:57,800 --> 02:05:58,180
Okay.

2010
02:06:02,430 --> 02:06:04,230
Alright, that's good.

It's the only one taking out the real...

2012
02:06:13,050 --> 02:06:15,230
I wish this had multiplayer, guys.

2013
02:06:16,730 --> 02:06:17,370
Imagine!

2014
02:06:19,510 --> 02:06:22,970
Share the depression together.

2015
02:06:23,670 --> 02:06:24,990
If this had multiplayer.

2016
02:06:27,390 --> 02:06:30,670
Now I know why there was a crack in my new monitor.

2017
02:06:31,110 --> 02:06:33,070
That was delivered on Monday.

2018

She's still smiling.

2021
02:06:39,930 --> 02:06:41,950
We need to change that.

2022
02:06:46,390 --> 02:06:48,570
I'm just going to give her the super chat.

2023
02:06:48,890 --> 02:06:49,710
Thank you, thank you.

2024
02:06:50,850 --> 02:06:52,270
I paid the extra.

2025
02:06:52,410 --> 02:06:55,350
I have my package delayed, broken, and lost.

2026
02:06:55,570 --> 02:06:57,650
Yes, but it's done by Tokey.

2027
02:06:57,990 --> 02:06:59,290
Thank you for the super chat.

2028
02:06:59,390 --> 02:07:00,110
Thank you, thank you.

2029
02:07:00,110 --> 02:07:01,090
That's the best part.

2030
02:07:02,250 --> 02:07:04,330
Oh my god, I have so many packages out here.

2031
02:07:04,690 --> 02:07:05,590
Okay, give me a sec.

2032

I'm gonna figure this out.

2034
02:07:08,490 --> 02:07:09,610
Alright, I'm gonna grab the ones with E.

2035
02:07:09,890 --> 02:07:11,690
The ones with E are easier to handle.

2036
02:07:16,690 --> 02:07:17,090
Alright.

2037
02:07:19,570 --> 02:07:19,970
Bakua.

2038
02:07:20,490 --> 02:07:25,010
I've been, like, grabbing packages all the time that I,
like, forgot what the flags looked like.

2039
02:07:29,740 --> 02:07:31,040
There's a fragile secret?

2040
02:07:31,160 --> 02:07:31,820
No, there wasn't.

2041
02:07:34,140 --> 02:07:35,600
I don't know what you're talking about.

2042
02:07:35,780 --> 02:07:36,700

2043

All right, which one is also E?

2049
02:08:23,920 --> 02:08:26,200
E ones are easy, because I don't have to weigh it.

2050
02:08:28,420 --> 02:08:29,220
Oh, there you go.

2051
02:08:31,220 --> 02:08:33,100

God damn, it's back.

2056
02:08:42,460 --> 02:08:43,920
I didn't even see the cake one.

2057
02:08:46,420 --> 02:08:48,220
God, I needed the Congrati one, too.

2058
02:08:49,580 --> 02:08:50,640
Guess I'll have to weigh it.

2063
02:09:23,860 --> 02:09:27,680
I thought I had a lot of money, but it still didn't matter.

2064
02:09:29,180 --> 02:09:30,700
Never mind, guys.

2065

2079
02:10:06,670 --> 02:10:06,930

Okay, all right.

2100
02:11:51,370 --> 02:11:53,810

02:12:48,800 --> 02:12:50,160

Anyway, okay, so unfortunately, I won't be doing a second
stream today.

2156
02:17:28,870 --> 02:17:36,150
I forgot to tell about that at the start of the stream
