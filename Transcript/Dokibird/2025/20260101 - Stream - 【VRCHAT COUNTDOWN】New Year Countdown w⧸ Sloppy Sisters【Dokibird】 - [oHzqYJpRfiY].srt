00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,360
Yeah, we're doing...

168
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,340
We're gonna do tech...

169
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,220
My beautiful bars!

170
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,840
This is like a technical...

171
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,680
Like, a...

172
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,940
Like, tech help right now.

173
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:19,320
Really?

174
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,080
Oh, really?

175
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,280
Like, I can only not get close to mint.

176
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:22,880
You're fine.

177
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,460
It's because we're friends.

178
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,400
You're not friends with mint?

179
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,280
That's messed up.

180
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,160
Okay.

181
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,560
Oh, and then just click on none.

182
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,640
Not recommended, but at least in the private group.

183
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,360
It's okay.

184
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,100
See if that helps.

185
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:40,680
Whoa.

186
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,600
No, you still disappear when I get close.

187
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,800
No, mint still disappears.

188
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,320
There might be like no Snuffy's fine.

189
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,880
Snuffy's fine and Doki's fine, but mint disappears.

190
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,160
It's probably just shouldn't have you added as a friend.

191
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,720
Yeah, it's friends only.

192
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,020
That's what I said.

193
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,480
That's what I said.

194
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,760
Okay, I did my fashion show.

195
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,520
Did you guys get my friend request?

196
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,920
I sent you one ages ago.

197
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,660
Yeah, I think you might be broken.

198
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:10,920
For some reason.

199
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,240
Yeah, you're not sending them and you're not receiving them.

200
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,540
Why are you like this?

201
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,560
I don't know.

202
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,220
I sent you one.

203
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:25,160
Let me just find where the, like, the setting is for that
anyway maybe we can just say like you oh uh i think what it

204
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:30,800
is okay so similarly to what i said if you double click on
the gear instead of shield level go to comfort and safety

205
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:38,540
and then unclick personal space make sure that's unchecked
so that yeah okay yeah i no longer value my personal space

206
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:49,700
around this so that's cool yay we did it everyone yay snuffy
how do i stop crying by accident you're gonna have to

207
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:56,140
practice just holding your gestures so if you don't like
your gestures auto moving uh if you hold b and pull up your

208
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:02,040
toolbar menu you can just you can just like disable gestures
i think somehow this is tech help otherwise they're

209
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:08,280
triggered to where your fingers are so like if you do finger
guns or if you do like pointer fingers or all your hands out

210
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:17,640
or something yeah so you guys wait stop you show your
expressions that you have show them to the camera look hello

211
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:30,500
everybody i got i I got a pair of these I don't know what
I'm doing Sorry, Mim's ass was in Oh,

212
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,660

213
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,500
I really like this.

214
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,140
Oh, yeah, this was cute.

215
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,140
Yeah, yeah, everyone picked their own expressions We got
like seven free expressions.

216
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,260
Well, it wasn't free.

217
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:49,960
It was they were all very expensive How do I tell them it's
taking two hours to figure out how to do it?

218
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,360
Guys, maybe an hour wasn't enough, guys.

219
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,780
We were all here for like...

220
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,840
The last time I was in VR chat was when I was with you.

221
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,780
That was like 10 or 16 years ago.

222
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:06,600
Guys, that's why it's like, guys, okay, I was like, all
right, Snuffy and I, we should get...

223
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,160
We'll be there for an hour and early, since we're streaming.

224
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,140
But I think we should have all been here an hour early.

225
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:13,380
Yeah.

226
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,000

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,560
Yeah, just maybe, maybe.

228
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,540
Oh, yeah, Naima, show your expressions.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

232
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,780
How do I show them if I just disable gestures so I stop
crying?

233
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,200
You're still okay.

234

You're floating more than you used to be.

If you go to the settings, just the regular settings, scroll
down until you get to tracking and IK.

281
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:12,900
Adjust the player height, the user real height, or the
avatar measurement settings, and just kind of play around

282
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,180
with that.

283
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,080
See if that helps you at all.

284
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,200

00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,440

Yeah.

296
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,940
You might want to recalibrate your full body.

297
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,340
Oh, I think you will be fixed.

298
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:36,860

It says I'm five foot nine.

300
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,900

00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,000
It makes me tall.

306
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,900

309
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:12,760
Sometimes it gets confused about like the way your dream

Yeah, yeah, she goes to her world.

313
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,860

00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,920
Why are you in the Salt Goodman universe?

00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,600
We are trying to find you!

514
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,680
Okay, here is the plan.

515
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,540

This is where I found her.

519
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:53,560
Yeah, this is, yeah, no, I had to, I was running through the
Saul Goodman matrix to try and find her.

520
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,520

521
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:57,740

Oh my god, Snuffy, are you okay?

524
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:15,400
She's like, she's like trapped in the matrix.

00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,480
No,

00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,320

527
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,680
Literally was just shouting mid while running through the
soul groupings.

528
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:29,480

00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:42,880
We should drop the portal, yeah.

535
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:43,840

536
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:44,740

Plains are cool!

585
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:43,110
That's true, that's what we learned.

586
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:43,890
That's what I learned.

587
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:45,710
Oh my gosh!

588
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:47,330

00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:56,370
I have free will.

593
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:57,830

it.

00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:46,630
I just do it with your eyes closed.

605
00:41:47,350 --> 00:42:00,990
reason why we didn't I didn't get motion sickness is because

00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:25,120
I was stuck in this smooth jazz dimension.

00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:42,740
What's the?

643
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:43,720
No, it's not elevator music.

644
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:46,200
It's, um, fuck, there's a genre for it.

645
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:48,200
It's the fast, that's the racing music.

646
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:49,720
No, no, no.

647
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:50,520
You don't understand.

648
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:51,880

652
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,340
Eurobeat, I'm getting Eurobeat.

655
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:08,800
Like, before you guys arrived, I thought I was just in
purgatory because all I can hear is elevator smooth jazz.

656
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,760
I think you're actually died or some shit.

657
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:11,800
At least you hear something.

658
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:12,680
I'm in silence.

659
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:17,340

We just hope to God that it's just us.

926
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:27,120
No, anyone can join, because that's the only way Mint can
see the portal.

01:40:40,630 --> 01:40:41,330
him.

1484
01:40:41,350 --> 01:40:43,110
Yeah, it's like $7.

1485
01:40:43,510 --> 01:40:46,450
Oh my god, oh $7.

1486
01:40:47,670 --> 01:40:52,670
Alright, how much was a popcorn bucket mint in Disneyland?

1487
01:40:53,750 --> 01:40:54,630
Oh, I don't know.

1488
01:40:54,790 --> 01:40:55,270
At Disneyland?

1489
01:40:55,790 --> 01:40:56,090
Yeah.

1490
01:40:57,310 --> 01:40:58,490
I'm gonna guess.

1491
01:40:59,430 --> 01:41:00,070
$40.

1492
01:41:00,970 --> 01:41:03,110
For a fucking piece of plastic.

1493
01:41:04,290 --> 01:41:04,730
$40?

1494
01:41:06,070 --> 01:41:06,930
Yeah, I do be fair.

1495
01:41:07,170 --> 01:41:07,790
I don't know if that's really...

1496
01:41:07,790 --> 01:41:10,710
I feel like it'd be $50 to hold your popcorn.

1497
01:41:12,730 --> 01:41:14,170
Yeah, it's over 50 apparently.

1498
01:41:15,450 --> 01:41:16,490
It has to be over...

1499
01:41:16,490 --> 01:41:17,850
The price of the ticket, right?

1500
01:41:18,290 --> 01:41:20,410
No, tickets are like $100 now.

1501
01:41:21,190 --> 01:41:21,530
Right.

1502
01:41:21,710 --> 01:41:21,990
That's...

1503
01:41:21,990 --> 01:41:22,810
If it's...

1504
01:41:22,810 --> 01:41:23,210
Yeah.

1505
01:41:23,770 --> 01:41:24,110
Oh, sorry.

1506
01:41:24,210 --> 01:41:24,790
I didn't know math.

1507
01:41:24,930 --> 01:41:25,130
Sorry.

1508
01:41:27,930 --> 01:41:29,270
Sorry, I went backwards.

1509
01:41:30,850 --> 01:41:32,950
It's a really difficult percentage.

1510
01:41:33,330 --> 01:41:33,510
Don't worry.

1511
01:41:33,750 --> 01:41:33,930
Yeah.

1512
01:41:34,230 --> 01:41:35,290
What's the percentage?

1513
01:41:35,390 --> 01:41:35,910
What is that?

1514
01:41:36,290 --> 01:41:37,210
That's like 30.

1515
01:41:37,450 --> 01:41:38,830
That's like one third, right?

1516
01:41:39,730 --> 01:41:40,010
Yeah.

1517
01:41:41,590 --> 01:41:42,130

Look at how short her skirt is.

1595
01:46:54,370 --> 01:46:55,230

Your skirt is slower than your pants.

1600
01:47:05,670 --> 01:47:06,890
It broke the rules.

1601
01:47:07,090 --> 01:47:09,410

When you do it, it's a lot less threatening.

01:48:18,070 --> 01:48:20,750
You're like...

1630
01:48:20,750 --> 01:48:21,190

Eh.

1633
01:48:25,390 --> 01:48:28,450

No, I only have one microphone.

1650
01:49:21,850 --> 01:49:22,850
It's up there.

1654
01:49:27,370 --> 01:49:28,050
Your headset.

1655
01:49:28,630 --> 01:49:31,910
If you go to your settings, it should tell you what you're
using.

1656
01:49:32,230 --> 01:49:33,530
Poor little baby.

1657
01:49:33,990 --> 01:49:36,030
No, no, no, I have the big screen beyond.

1658
01:49:36,170 --> 01:49:36,990
It doesn't have a mic.

1659
01:49:37,630 --> 01:49:38,250
Oh, what?

1660
01:49:38,410 --> 01:49:39,770
But it sounds so good.

1661
01:49:39,890 --> 01:49:41,510
Like, you sound like you're so close to the mic.

1662
01:49:41,570 --> 01:49:42,130
Wait, hold on.

1663
01:49:42,310 --> 01:49:46,170
I'm gonna go touch- I'm gonna go smack my microphone and you
let me know if it makes a thump.

1664
01:49:46,590 --> 01:49:47,630
Oh, fuck, I can't get up.

1665
01:49:47,810 --> 01:49:50,050
I had someone go break in.

1666
01:49:50,550 --> 01:49:51,570
I can get up.

1667
01:49:51,670 --> 01:49:52,110
Wait, hold on.

1668
01:49:52,250 --> 01:49:52,990
Where's my mat?

1669
01:49:53,230 --> 01:49:55,130
Which way is my desk?

1670
01:49:55,410 --> 01:49:56,510
Which way is my desk?

1671
01:49:56,510 --> 01:49:57,110
Which way is my desk?

1672
01:49:57,430 --> 01:49:57,910
I'm a stuck.

1673
01:49:57,910 --> 01:49:59,690
Look, okay, I found my desk.

1674
01:49:59,930 --> 01:50:00,590
I found my desk.

1675
01:50:00,850 --> 01:50:01,810
Where the fuck is my microphone?

1676
01:50:02,410 --> 01:50:02,910
Oh, God.

1677
01:50:03,110 --> 01:50:03,510
Oh, you're seeing.

1678
01:50:03,650 --> 01:50:05,030
Okay, I'm hitting my mic.

1679
01:50:05,610 --> 01:50:05,930
No!

1680
01:50:06,350 --> 01:50:07,330
No, it's not.

1681
01:50:07,490 --> 01:50:08,170
It's your headset.

1682
01:50:08,470 --> 01:50:10,210
It's literally your headset.

1683
01:50:10,890 --> 01:50:12,310
Is there a headset mic?

1684
01:50:12,410 --> 01:50:13,310
Yes, it is.

1685
01:50:13,970 --> 01:50:14,870
I'm going looking.

1686
01:50:16,370 --> 01:50:17,350
I'm going looking.

1687
01:50:17,630 --> 01:50:20,050
It must have hijacked my audio settings then because I
didn't pick it.

1688
01:50:20,470 --> 01:50:21,490
Yeah, but it sounds good though.

1689
01:50:21,870 --> 01:50:22,430
It does sound good.

1690
01:50:22,570 --> 01:50:23,750
It does sound good?

1691
01:50:24,030 --> 01:50:24,730
It'll just...

1692
01:50:24,730 --> 01:50:25,810
Yeah, it sounds great, actually.

1693
01:50:25,990 --> 01:50:27,490
If I hit my headset, can you...

1694
01:50:27,490 --> 01:50:28,610
Is that it doing it?

1695
01:50:29,730 --> 01:50:30,850
Where's the microphone?

1696
01:50:31,090 --> 01:50:31,590
I don't think so.

1697
01:50:32,830 --> 01:50:39,550
It's usually like for the CBR, it's kind of like right here,
like under the eyes or by the ears.

1698
01:50:39,770 --> 01:50:40,550
She's so smart.

1699
01:50:41,570 --> 01:50:42,410
She's so smart.

1700
01:50:42,570 --> 01:50:47,490
I really know that because I touch it so much on stream that
chat is always freaking out and being like, ah, you hit the

1701
01:50:47,490 --> 01:50:47,850
mic.

1702
01:50:48,190 --> 01:50:50,010
She's like the professor.

1703
01:50:50,850 --> 01:50:51,850
We're having a TED talk.

1704
01:50:52,010 --> 01:50:52,510

Yeah.

1770
01:54:16,660 --> 01:54:21,800
I used a lot with my Lamon avatar because he was like, he
came through really big, which was really weird.

1771
01:54:21,880 --> 01:54:22,740
He's not supposed to be that big.

1772
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:23,440
He was like a master.

1773
01:54:23,440 --> 01:54:24,080
Wait, wait.

1774
01:54:24,500 --> 01:54:27,240
Which, dude, your Lamon avatar would look like Totoro?

1775
01:54:27,720 --> 01:54:28,820
Wait, you should try that out.

1776
01:54:29,140 --> 01:54:30,420
Yeah, he does.

1777
01:54:30,760 --> 01:54:31,360
Yeah, I would.

1778
01:54:31,620 --> 01:54:31,840
He's round.

1779
01:54:32,340 --> 01:54:33,500
He's just as round.

1780
01:54:33,700 --> 01:54:34,660
You gotta be big with him.

1781
01:54:40,290 --> 01:54:40,810
Oops.

1782
01:54:43,530 --> 01:54:47,750
But man, people in chat are like yelling at camera for not
going under your...

1783
01:54:48,850 --> 01:54:51,130
You're scared when you were big.

1784
01:54:51,550 --> 01:54:55,370
When you were big, they're like, cameraman, you had one job.

1785
01:54:55,670 --> 01:54:56,270
Okay, be nice.

1786
01:54:56,350 --> 01:54:57,010

Frogbert said that.

Frogbert said that.

1887
02:02:43,030 --> 02:02:43,630
Frogbert said that.

1888
02:02:43,670 --> 02:02:45,550
Frogbert is a regular movie critic.

1889
02:02:45,810 --> 02:02:47,150
I respect their opinions.

1890
02:02:49,630 --> 02:02:50,470
That's right.

1891
02:02:50,810 --> 02:02:53,210
Wait, Lamu, have you watched K-pop Demon Unders?

1892
02:02:54,390 --> 02:02:54,870
No.

1893
02:02:55,330 --> 02:02:56,730
Oh, so she can't give an opinion.

1894
02:02:57,750 --> 02:02:57,910
No.

1895
02:02:57,910 --> 02:02:59,410
She just wants to watch Avatar.

1896
02:03:00,270 --> 02:03:01,870
Oh, yeah, you're obsessed with Avatar.

1897
02:03:02,770 --> 02:03:04,110
I already watched Avatar.

1898
02:03:05,210 --> 02:03:15,370
you heard me i had a good time i like that you know that
hang had to die for another avatar to be born we had this

1899
02:03:15,370 --> 02:03:25,950
conversation already wait i have something to show you okay
there's a there's an avatar fighting game where kora and ang

1900
02:03:25,950 --> 02:03:32,270
are fighting against each other and you said one must die
that's why they're fighting that's why they're like this

1901
02:03:32,270 --> 02:03:35,690
can't be happening this can't work Right now it's a paradox.

1902
02:03:36,270 --> 02:03:40,290
It's a paradox one must die That's why they're fighting.

1903
02:03:40,310 --> 02:03:41,570
It's in the afterlife.

1904
02:03:41,890 --> 02:03:41,950
Yeah.

1905
02:03:42,050 --> 02:03:42,390
Yeah.

1906
02:03:43,250 --> 02:03:43,250
Yeah.

1907
02:03:43,310 --> 02:03:43,310
Yeah.

1908
02:03:43,310 --> 02:03:48,150
It's in the afterlife because they're technically they're
both dead now Yeah, wait what?

1909
02:03:48,630 --> 02:03:54,470
Kora don't you remember in season two Kora teleported to the
to the demon realm of the souls and she met the first ever

1910
02:03:54,470 --> 02:03:57,030
avatar So technically that's true in their past lives.

1911
02:03:57,170 --> 02:03:58,630
They're able to reunite and fight each other.

1912
02:03:58,730 --> 02:03:59,910
That's true That is true.

1913
02:04:00,090 --> 02:04:02,410
I'm actually you know like mint.

1914
02:04:02,710 --> 02:04:12,090
Oh sorry frog brute thought that like Wait, was it you that
was saying like what if like They made another avatar like

1915
02:04:12,090 --> 02:04:19,630
like was it you that was saying how like Why did why did
Aang have to die when he could just like When he just can

1916
02:04:19,630 --> 02:04:26,710
just streamline the avatar process Where he dies in the
middle I think it's kind of lame that his kids didn't become

1917
02:04:26,710 --> 02:04:33,130
the avatar Yeah, yeah, yeah, so That's like a Nepo hire
Yeah, so she we were talking about like what you want like

1918
02:04:33,130 --> 02:04:33,530
Is that genetic?

1919
02:04:33,850 --> 02:04:40,030
I thought so Yeah, no, like, yeah, so Min's, sorry,
Frogbert's idea was, what if, like, you know, during the

1920
02:04:40,030 --> 02:04:43,570
middle of it, during Conception, he passes on the avatar.

1921
02:04:44,310 --> 02:04:44,530
So, like,

1922
02:04:49,430 --> 02:04:54,890
so then, so then you secure the line, you secure the avatar
line.

1923
02:04:55,350 --> 02:04:56,430
You keep it in the family.

1924
02:04:57,090 --> 02:05:03,230
He takes a pill of cyanide while having sex, just so his
kids get the guaranteed button today.

1925
02:05:06,830 --> 02:05:12,890
He bites the tube, bites the cyanide tube in the middle of
conception.

1926
02:05:13,190 --> 02:05:16,530
Do you think when he gets older, people get like really
freaky about it?

1927
02:05:16,650 --> 02:05:18,350
So they're like, dude, Eng is like 88.

1928
02:05:18,510 --> 02:05:19,190
We gotta get you.

1929
02:05:19,250 --> 02:05:20,050
We gotta get you knocked up.

1930
02:05:20,310 --> 02:05:21,210
That's what I saw.

1931
02:05:22,350 --> 02:05:23,850
I thought, what's her name?

1932
02:05:25,090 --> 02:05:25,570
Katara.

1933
02:05:25,890 --> 02:05:26,150
Katara.

1934
02:05:26,550 --> 02:05:29,110
I thought she killed him because I was maybe like.

1935
02:05:30,190 --> 02:05:33,610
Someone in chat said, he's the avatar, not a fruit fly.

1936
02:05:43,850 --> 02:05:50,410
I swear to God the new season is gonna talk about this I can
see that I can see that people do avatars are twins

1937
02:05:50,410 --> 02:05:57,150
apparently spoiler sorry spoiler spoiler there's a new
avatar it's coming out yeah it's coming out and the cons

1938
02:05:57,150 --> 02:06:02,390
spoilers by the way the concept is that they're planning on
making the avatar twins so I don't fucking know how that's

1939
02:06:02,390 --> 02:06:12,990
gonna work your whole everything your whole explanation has
been I think they said that only one of the twins is the

1940
02:06:12,990 --> 02:06:20,130
avatar so there's probably gonna be the whole idea of like
oh my sister's the avatar but I'm just the inferior yeah how

I like how being a VR trucker makes you feel like an old
person, though.

2021
02:09:51,930 --> 02:09:54,970
You just very slowly, carefully get down onto the floor.

2022
02:09:55,110 --> 02:09:56,770
It's like, oh, better not break my hip.

2023
02:09:56,930 --> 02:09:58,990
I think getting up is so worse though.

2024

All the details and the interactive stuff is so well done.

We didn't even do any of the games, too.

We have games here.

2113
02:17:00,540 --> 02:17:01,800
We'll have to do that.

2114
02:17:02,360 --> 02:17:03,940
Especially when we do the meet and greet.

2115
02:17:04,300 --> 02:17:05,380
We can show people for something.

2116
02:17:05,740 --> 02:17:09,200
Yeah, we can challenge our fans, too, for some of the games.

2117

Yeah, we have, like, several games scattered around the
world, too, for the interactive and stuff.

2120
02:17:16,460 --> 02:17:18,500
But there's a lot of fun things around.

2134
02:17:58,860 --> 02:18:00,420

Yeah.

2147
02:18:17,340 --> 02:18:18,540
Yeah, we could do, like, the Wild West.

2148
02:18:18,580 --> 02:18:22,020
We can, like, turn around and walk 10 steps and fire.

2149
02:18:22,800 --> 02:18:26,960
I like how yours is, like, a traditional Wild West gun, and

the other day like a legitimate what was it what was it i

2152
02:18:45,820 --> 02:18:52,880

don't play it by the way like emotionally devastating yeah

2153
02:18:52,880 --> 02:18:58,880
no i made my entire chat like have just a mental breakdown
but like there is this one section where you do stealth

2154
02:18:58,880 --> 02:19:04,240
there's this one section where you do stealth and they do
bring out the box they bring out the metal gear box and you

2155
02:19:04,240 --> 02:19:09,120
use it to get put so you know you could play it if you want
the metal gear reference but just prepare to be like

2156
02:19:09,120 --> 02:19:18,980
emotionally broken for it's okay the rest of the day i'll
tell you this the dog's already dead the dog is already dead

2157
02:19:18,980 --> 02:19:26,380

Yeah, yeah, but it's a game.

2158
02:19:26,700 --> 02:19:27,860
Jesus, the dogs are already dead.

2159
02:19:28,100 --> 02:19:30,560
The dog in heaven having to stealth around.

2160
02:19:31,860 --> 02:19:32,900
It's a whole thing.

2161
02:19:33,100 --> 02:19:33,860
It's a whole thing.

2162
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:35,760
People are like, spoilers, Doki.

2163
02:19:35,980 --> 02:19:38,540
You literally see the trailer and the fucking dog has a
halo.

2164
02:19:38,840 --> 02:19:39,560
Like, we all...

2165
02:19:39,560 --> 02:19:41,240
Yeah, it's not a spoiler.

2166
02:19:41,500 --> 02:19:42,980
The premise is that he's already in heaven.

2167
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,880
He's in heaven and he's waiting for his owner to join him.

2168
02:19:46,100 --> 02:19:46,460
Oh.

2169
02:19:48,300 --> 02:19:49,280
That's so sad.

2170
02:19:49,360 --> 02:19:49,920
That's so sad.

2171
02:19:49,920 --> 02:19:50,620
She's playing it.

2172
02:19:50,640 --> 02:19:52,800
One day, he's like, I can smell my owner.

2173
02:19:52,900 --> 02:19:54,000
I'm going to go find him.

2174
02:19:54,060 --> 02:19:54,680
So he sets up on a...

2175
02:19:54,700 --> 02:20:05,020
journey through the afterlife oh but it has a metal gear
reference meant that's perfect i got i got i got completely

2176
02:20:05,020 --> 02:20:11,260
fucked up by it though because like i have red hair and i
have two pomeranians and then like at the very start of the

2177
02:20:11,260 --> 02:20:16,560
game they did like a reunion scene and this pomeranian was
like he was he suddenly stopped playing with his toy in the

2178
02:20:16,560 --> 02:20:25,260
afterlife and he sniffed and this little girl with red hair
walked through the fucking gates and they were reunited I

2179
02:20:25,260 --> 02:20:26,640
hate the tears.

2180
02:20:26,760 --> 02:20:29,940
I was like, oh, what the heck?

2181
02:20:30,180 --> 02:20:30,960
They clipped me up.

2182
02:20:31,060 --> 02:20:32,220
It's so it's targeting.

2183
02:20:32,360 --> 02:20:33,860
Only a sick person makes again like the...

2184
02:20:35,060 --> 02:20:37,680
I bet they made a lot of money off of your grief.

2185
02:20:39,540 --> 02:20:40,800
Yeah, and that's what's important.

2186
02:20:41,040 --> 02:20:41,220
No.

2187
02:20:41,440 --> 02:20:43,280

our bond that it's so cute.

02:26:14,100 --> 02:26:17,820
Even that it's, like, yo, it's Doki Lahn, but it feels kind
of like home to me.

2295
02:26:18,260 --> 02:26:20,460

board dragon come on come here with me we got i'm i know i'm

02:29:52,060 --> 02:30:05,290
walking weird but I'm now sitting down oh I'm sitting down
now it was fun all the adrenaline is gone now with the

2357
02:30:05,290 --> 02:30:15,010
sloppy sisters gone all the energy I kept in me gone oh yeah
the SCZ's you guys when when the world's public you can be

2358

El Changoon or Igoon or Longoon or dragon you can be any
goons you want to be that's right i know i'm so tired

2359
02:30:34,930 --> 02:30:44,650
i'm so tired but i had a lot of fun i had a lot of fun today
with the sloppy sisters it truly was i think this was truly

2360
02:30:44,650 --> 02:30:54,970
is the sloppiest vr reveal i've ever done but i think he
agrees he's been through a lot of of these VR stuff.

2361
02:30:55,530 --> 02:30:57,950
He's a veteran in our VR projects.

2362
02:30:58,710 --> 02:31:00,410
The Dragoon is a veteran.

2363
02:31:02,630 --> 02:31:09,370
But I think it wouldn't be a sloppy Sister's collab if the
VR world isn't sloppy too.

2364
02:31:09,810 --> 02:31:12,070
If the stream isn't sloppy as well.

2365
02:31:12,470 --> 02:31:12,610
All right.

2366
02:31:13,430 --> 02:31:19,370
I need you to get a good angle on this thing right here.

2367
02:31:20,310 --> 02:31:20,810

02:31:35,450 --> 02:31:48,010
a new cameraman but welcome to Dokilan the dragons number

hands-free i've been for a vr project because like i said

2376
02:32:36,270 --> 02:32:46,750
this entire year has been so fucking busy for me so i would
give input but like every couple of months i'd give input i

2377
02:32:46,750 --> 02:32:53,170

2380
02:32:58,770 --> 02:33:00,870
And I was like, okay, you guys, I delegate to you guys.

2381
02:33:00,950 --> 02:33:03,930
If they are trying to reach me, they reach you guys.

2382
02:33:04,170 --> 02:33:09,650
And then the last December, in December, I was like, I came
into this world.

2383
02:33:09,730 --> 02:33:15,090

this, and then we're good to go.

like my vision in there um i like wrote some of the dialogue

2387
02:33:40,270 --> 02:33:46,230

2388
02:33:46,230 --> 02:33:52,850
i did change a lot of the dialogue lines around here to have
more of an homage to like all the stuff that you guys like

in this world in doke land and um and we're going to select

2404
02:35:58,030 --> 02:36:04,390
time that won't be fucked for limo because i'm not i'm sorry

2405
02:36:04,390 --> 02:36:14,610

the asia goons out there because um we gotta make sure that

2406
02:36:14,610 --> 02:36:17,310

02:36:20,090 --> 02:36:21,270
And she's British.

2408
02:36:21,550 --> 02:36:22,450
I know it's Cree.

2409
02:36:22,530 --> 02:36:23,870
Some people are like, she's British?

2410
02:36:24,270 --> 02:36:27,090
Like, she's British, by the way.

2411

You can't really tell, too.

2413
02:36:33,870 --> 02:36:37,990
But for those who don't know about this, we did this one
time.

2414
02:36:38,050 --> 02:36:40,310
Mia Mint did this one time, a long time ago.

2415
02:36:40,690 --> 02:36:41,790
It was also my idea.

2416
02:36:42,190 --> 02:36:44,770
And it was really hard to get perms for it.

2417
02:36:44,890 --> 02:36:55,550
but now we don't need perms so we could do it whenever we
want how many times we want uh just matter of our schedules

my last pair of contacts I had to call like literally I was
like today I was calling all the glasses I did something

2612
02:53:04,930 --> 02:53:11,250
illegal today someone also did something illegal today but
basically like um you're supposed to get contacts

02:59:28,270 --> 02:59:36,350
and all their hard work I want you guys to know that we
actually had like an emergency or sorry an emergency with

2672
02:59:36,350 --> 02:59:47,070
our camera an hour before the stream was supposed to start
we were testing out the camera system and we me and longoon

2673
02:59:47,070 --> 02:59:54,030
were fucking panicking and freaking out because we had a
little little bug for the camera system but we made it work

2674
02:59:54,030 --> 03:00:01,670
i was like i was like it's okay we won't be in the world we
won't be in the world until like two hours so you have an

2675
03:00:01,670 --> 03:00:09,110
extra hour to figure out what the fuck is going on and i
literally said to him quote unquote if this doesn't work i

2676
03:00:09,110 --> 03:00:09,370
will be

2677
03:00:13,750 --> 03:00:20,070
I was like, um, if I, if this cat, if there's this bug, I
would be angry.

2678
03:00:25,240 --> 03:00:26,900
No pressure, by the way.

2679
03:00:27,180 --> 03:00:28,660
But it was like jokingly.

2680
03:00:29,560 --> 03:00:30,540
I like laughed after.

2681
03:00:30,640 --> 03:00:30,920
I was like,

2682
03:00:33,980 --> 03:00:37,220
right, right, Dragoon?

2683
03:00:37,500 --> 03:00:38,620
It was a joke, right?

2684
03:00:38,900 --> 03:00:39,500
Yeah, see?

2685
03:00:39,760 --> 03:00:40,480
He's nodding.

2686
03:00:40,960 --> 03:00:42,580
He's nodding, no, no, no, no.

2687
03:00:42,740 --> 03:00:43,540
Keep nodding.

2688
03:00:43,840 --> 03:00:44,700
Keep nodding.

2689
03:00:50,480 --> 03:00:59,700
what was the bug so you don't see it anymore but basically
in VR chat you get to see this there's a camera monitor that

2690
03:00:59,700 --> 03:01:07,120
we can I can see where I would know what's going on so when
but and it was showing up on the camera and that wasn't good

2691
03:01:07,120 --> 03:01:13,560
because it was very like unimmersive because wherever I go
my camera will suddenly randomly show up like not camera but

2692
03:01:13,560 --> 03:01:21,300
like my monitor so I know like what at and everything and um
and then so like we had to figure out what the fuck to do to

2693
03:01:21,300 --> 03:01:25,420
fix it so they literally was are you okay oh my god she
tripped and fell

2694
03:01:31,720 --> 03:01:41,200
anyway so um so we they managed to fix it like um because i
was like okay don't worry like we're gonna stall until this

2695
03:01:41,200 --> 03:01:47,840
is fixed um that's why um we were like walking or like this
we view this world like right away it was you know always at

2696
03:01:47,840 --> 03:01:57,940
the end um but they fixed it while we were obviously trying
to find mint too trying to find mint someone call the
