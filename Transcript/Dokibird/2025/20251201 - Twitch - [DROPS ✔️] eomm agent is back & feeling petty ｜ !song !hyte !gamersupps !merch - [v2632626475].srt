1
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,700
Hello, hello everyone!

2
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:55,460
If I sound tired right now, it is because it's 5 in the
morning.

3
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:03,660
Now some of you might be wondering, why the fuck are you
streaming at 5 in the morning?

4
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,620
And also, didn't you say you were gonna take a three-day
break?

5
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,400
to get the Jeff's business skin.

6
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:26,680
So I was like, I'm going to play a couple of games because I
really, really want to play, get the Jeff skin.

7
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:36,520
And then, you know, the last game I played, I got flamed by
two pro players on my team.

8
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:43,620
And now I feel petty as fuck because they think they can
flame me when I'm not streaming.

9
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:57,460
I had so I cried by the way right after I started crying
right after but I'm okay now I'm I feel now I'm feeling they

10
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:08,280
think they think that oh I'll stop queuing and I'll stop
terrorizing their fucking games I did cry but I'm back I'm

11
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:16,600
back though I'm but I came back because I was like You think
that's the last you'll see of me?

12
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,540
I'm gonna keep going.

13
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,200
And because you can't avoid me forever.

14
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,720
I hope I get on your team again.

15
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:31,460
So I just feel sort of very petty right now.

16
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:41,260
The thing is, I made, okay, I would say I did make mistakes
in the beginning of the game.

17
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,680
Like the first half of the game, I made mistakes, but then
the second half.

18
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:52,020
I didn't fuck up, but they kept blaming me like I was just
like bro Okay, I would admit that I did make like a mistake

19
00:03:52,020 --> 00:04:00,860
that caused us like the last fight But then they kept
flaming me like not only in like in Matt like they're like

20
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:05,500
Gee, geez, we might as well forfeit because she's on our
team I was like bro.

21
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:18,020
What the fuck like I was just like My what my mistake cannot
mean that I sabotaged the entire game like so yeah and then

22
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:25,620
and because and I was like bro what the fuck and then so so
also like obviously streaming always makes me feel better so

23
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:32,580
that's why I'm doing that too also by the way it didn't help
that right after that game after I started like when I was

24
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:39,300
done crying um um I got my period so I was just like oh
that's why

25
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,680
Now I get it.

26
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:53,100
So it's much more, it's more, it's even more justified as to
why I'm very petty right now.

27
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,600
So, and a classic women moment, you know.

28
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,420
So yeah, that's why I chose to do.

29
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,380
Now it's more justification as to why I chose to do this
instead of sleeping it off.

30
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:17,500
So anyway, anyway, after, after that, they, he, and then
like, they kept flaming me, it's because I checked out their

31
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:22,460
stream, I was like, wait, I, because I recognized these
players, so I, like, checked out their stream because they

32
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:32,060
were streaming, and then they proceed to fucking continue to
flame me, like, to their chats, looking at my stats for that

33
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:35,040
game, I'm like, bro, fuck you.

34
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,640
And so like, that's why I'm now I'm here.

35
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,380
Because I was like, you can't avoid me forever.

36
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,080
You think just because you made me cry.

37
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,500
Just because you made me cry.

38
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,360
That I will stop queuing.

39
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,600
Yes, but it was only temporary.

40
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,520
But now I'm back.

41
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,920
I'm fucking back.

42
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,420
Also, I'm testing out my soundproof too.

43
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,180
I'm testing out my soundproof as well.

44
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,160
It's good timing.

45
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,500
Because I haven't tested it.

46
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:16,720
yet i haven't tested out um that's right i am an e-o-m agent
and i will fucking terrorize these lobbies i'm back baby i'm

47
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:28,020
let your anger feel you so no they were just they were
actual they were just they were assholes man i was just like

48
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:36,940
bro what the i was just like bro like fuck off Like, the
fact that they just kept going at it, too.

49
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,460
I was just like, bro, fuck off.

50
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,080
It's 5 in the morning.

51
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,760
Okay, it was 4 in the morning when it happened.

52
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:48,040
I was like, bro, you're playing Rink at 4 in the fucking
morning.

53
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,620
I just wanted the Jeffskin.

54
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,660
I just wanted the Jeffskin.

55
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,300
So, yes, so am I.

56
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:02,560
But, like, you should not be expecting top performance.

57
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,500
at four in the morning.

58
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,580
You should know what you're getting at four in the morning.

59
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:12,100
And if they are on East Coast, you should know what you're
getting at seven in the morning.

60
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:17,500
Like what type of games you're getting at that time.

61
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,080
You should know.

62
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,920
Like I've accepted what lobbies I'm getting at this time.

63
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,980
What type of idiots queuing at seven in the morning.

64
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:42,840
so um so that's why i have a lot of adrenaline right now uh
going okay now now i have adrenaline again because i'm

to stream too because i'm like if anyone's gonna flame me
i'm making content out of it like this i'm not being flamed

00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,480
There's no subway station at the Funko Shop.

156
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,740
Oh, never find out, I guess.

157
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,420
Yeah, that's a bus stop.

158
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,220
That ain't no.

159
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,280
That's a bus stop, guys.

160
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,200
Okay, so, okay.

161
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,900
Actually, I won't spoil it.

162
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,880
I won't spoil it for you guys.

163
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,620
I want to play Gambit!

164
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:03,700
Torch?

165
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,360
Okay.

166
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,880
Sorry, you're at the wrong season right now.

167
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:11,920
Like...

168
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,200
Oh my gosh.

169
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:16,740
Oh my god.

170
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:17,700
This guy was in a...

171
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,280
Yeah, this guy was in a coma.

172
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,680
He was in a coma during Torch season and just woke up and
was like, Hey guys, oh my god, can't believe they don't...

173
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,620
They didn't ban Torch guys.

174
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,220
They're fucking stupid.

175
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,020
Oh my god.

176
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,280
Little does he know.

177
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,100
Okay, I'm banning there.

178
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,380
I don't fucking care what any of these guys do.

179
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,560
I'm adding Daredevil.

180
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,060
Gone.

181
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,720
Thank you for the Twitch Prime.

182
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:50,180

00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,000
Thank you.

184
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,880
Really appreciate it.

185
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,180
Oh, I don't have cough drops right now.

186
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,340
See, guys, no noise complaints.

187
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:03,660
Guys, no noise complaints yet after that outburst I had in
the beginning of the stream.

188
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,540
No knock, knock, knock.

189
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,420
Oh, we found the same thing.

190
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,060

Oh, my gosh.

195
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:15,320
Okay.

196
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:20,700
Okay, I guess I guess the game decided to terrorize me.

197
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,320
Oh, that's that's fine.

198
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,400
Oh, man.

199
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,860

Okay.

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,140
Oh, yeah.

00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:42,640
No, Fucking I guess I why do I get the karma?

204
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:49,420
I guess what the fuck Why do I get the karma?

205
00:17:49,560 --> 00:18:03,200
I was a good person in rivals I never flame anyone in rivals
like like um to their face Like like to their face.

206
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:13,340
Okay, okay I was just expecting the card tricks from dr.

ha ha, too, KC, yeah, it's that way to go.

208
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:25,040
The battle starts in five, four, three, two, one.

209
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:26,460
All right.

210
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,920
All right, I don't think, I don't know, I'm not very
confident, guys.

211
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,660
Like I said, I also have not been playing that much.

212
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,520
I did not play since the new season came out.

213
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,560
Oh, nice.

214
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,080
Yay!

215
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,060
Or not the new season.

216
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,880
I haven't played since the anniversary came out.

217
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,720
Because, I don't know.

218
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,680
I just wasn't playing.

219
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,260
I don't know.

220
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:54,940
I don't know.

221
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,660
I was so busy, to be fair.

222
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,860
I was very busy.

223
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,420
Oh, my God.

224
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,240
He was so low.

225
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,420
Oh, my God.

226
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,060
He's so low.

227
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,240
Oh, my God.

228
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,620
My team is so low, too.

229
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,320
I need to reload.

230
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,780
Who the fuck?

231
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,160
Oh, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

232
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,160
Poor team.

233
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,320
Poor team.

234
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,400
Oh, he didn't want to 1v1 me.

235
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:19,760
Good.

236
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,720
Because I didn't want to 1v1 him, too.

237
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,180
I got, I was a little...

238
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:24,820
Oh, shit.

239
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:25,680
No!

240
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,840
I almost had all.

241
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,340
Oh, we both almost had all.

242
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,680
Oh, I couldn't survive long enough.

243
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,920
I don't know if he could survive too.

244
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,180
No!

245
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,440
Oh my god, are you serious?

246
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,920
I just literally just got there.

247
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,040
Oh, we don't have a TP.

248
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,220
Oh, that's fine.

249
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:45,620
That's fine.

250
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,140
We didn't want a TP out of there.

251
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,760
We didn't want a TP out of there.

252
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,180
It's okay.

253
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,100
It's okay.

254
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,120
It's okay.

255
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:56,640
It's okay.

256
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,140
Okay.

257
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,000
Are we stacking?

258
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:02,820
Yes, we are.

259
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:03,400
That's good.

260
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,060
All right.

261
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,400
We're just gonna have to do this.

262
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,580
I don't want to...

263
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:18,560

270
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,760

No, I knew that this team...

296
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,580
Let's just say that I have one more kill than our DPS
player.

297
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:15,260
so which is the same much because it's two uh but the fact
that uh two is the most kills that our dps players got is

what oh my god both flankers are okay i didn't realize i
didn't realize hawkeye was also behind us okay no our team

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,460
Oh my god.

302
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,770
I should not be trying to control two flankers.

303
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,300
I...

304
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,120

00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,460
Oh, bro, you should not have had your Discord out.

00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,220
I'll show you the way.

341
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,440
The moment I figure out where the subway is.

342
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,700
So where is the subway again?

343
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,160
Oh, that's cute.

344
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,320
There's like a little file work there.

345
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,120
Oh, they're on the other side.

346
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,800
I'm gonna report them.

347
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,720
I don't care.

348
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,120
Oh, it's a hot topic?

349
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:07,960
Wee.

350
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,300
Alright, don't worry.

00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,540
I'm going to head over.

352
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,820
Wait, can I, like, go?

353
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,520

Okay, so.

355
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:22,440
So the fun thing about it is that I think, like, I think I
have to be Jeff, right?

356
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,800
Okay, so.

357
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,560

You're out of boundaries.

Okay, it was on my for you page.

388
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,000
So the freak finds me.

389
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:34,040
I can't touch it here.

390
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,520

course about the invisible woman on the freak side okay
everyone should like i don't know why people are still like

412
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:30,160
judging rivals for being like super gooner because that is
what they've been since season zero so like i don't

413
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:36,660
understand why people are still judging them like you know
what you know what you're gonna get at this point the new

414
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:47,600
okay so basically the discourse about invisible women's new
skin is that if you check her name card out I don't even

files you don't see on like on like the actual like the
in-game one but apparently in the in the files her entire

It's this one.

435
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:48,900
There.

436
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:54,240
You'll need a top-notch team to win this one.

437
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,180
Rocket, okay.

438
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:00,660
That's...

439
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,920
That's interesting.

440
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:06,260
This team does not look very inspiring right now.

441
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,300
Oh, okay.

442
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,120
No, we're all right.

443
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:09,780
Okay, okay, okay.

444
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,140
Things are never mind.

445
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,020
Things look a bit okay.

446
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,400
Things look better.

447
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,500
Oh, but never mind.

448
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,660
Now, never mind.

449
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:22,240
One thing.

450
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,300
I said, things are looking better.

451
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,120
Doesn't imply.

452
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,740
Doesn't mean that you should go think.

453
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,380
It doesn't mean that.

454
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:36,980
But, like, anyway, like I said, like, people were
criticizing rivals for Gooner content.

455
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,340
I'm like, bro, like, everyone knows.

456
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,640

461
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,840
Oh my god, a fucking curse.

462
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:18,720
Okay, I'm gonna...

463
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,940
You normally would not waste that on this, but I will make
the exception.

464
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,460
Oh my god.

465
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:28,160

There we go.

00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,120
Jesus Christ.

00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,940
Okay, I had to...

469
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:42,060
I hate using Kitos for it, but my team really needs Kitos.

470
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,280
Oh my god, she's playing this invisible woman.

00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,620
Okay, it's fine, it's fine.

00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,980
Oh my, I have to reload though.

484
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,280
It's okay.

485
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:34,060

Alright, it's fine.

I forgot.

511
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,880
Strange also has a shield.

512
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:32,760
Okay.

513
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:37,320

00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:42,580

523
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,180
Okay, I should have saved him.

524
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,120
I should have saved him.

525
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,900
I would admit if he could have lived.

526
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,420
There we go.

527
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,280

Thank you, thank you.

00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,780
I've had a great stream.

531
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:37,880
I'm, I'm, I'm, is that the real, oh my God, is that the,
the, the, the, the, what was it?

532
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,720
The toxic Sakura?

533
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:43,140
From like four plus seasons ago?

534
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:45,860

536
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:48,560
There you go.

537
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:49,660
That's fucking right.

538
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:50,460
I have ears.

539
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:51,700
Sorry, guys.

540
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,440
I can't look at Chad.

541
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,460
Gambit takes, like, so much of my brain, and I don't have
much of that.

542
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,640
So, like, I have to focus so much.

543
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:06,540
Because I don't have a lot of my brain to use that for it.

544
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,420
Okay, I can.

545
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,160
Oh, okay.

546
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,540
I mean, I mean, Silok's gonna ult soon.

547
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:12,840

00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,040

00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,500

561
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:37,700

00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,680

You're never safe.

00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,620
So, you know what?

00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,620
I just felt like...

633
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:15,260
I felt really bad for the enemy team, so I let them kill me.

634
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,160
Guys.

635
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,880

00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,800
Okay, I gotta make sure my other tank doesn't die also.

639
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:28,660
Okay, I just want to make sure.

640
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,860

Oh, no.

647
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:38,300
Oh, no.

648
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,000
They walled me off.

649
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:39,520
They walled me off.

650
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:39,980
It's okay.

651
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:40,520

Look at that.

655
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:46,940
Cleanse not needed.

Okay, all right.

You know, I did not expect that.

665
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,660
I thought we could live.

666
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,940
Oh, she's dead.

667
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,460

668
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,060
I knew it was over for her.

669
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:15,720
It's okay.

670
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:17,140
It's okay.

671
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,340

hopeful all right i'm just using that to stabilize at this

686
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:55,090
point like i'm gonna use this to stabilize like i this is
not about this is this is a defensive There's absolutely a

687
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:55,950
defensive ult.

688
00:43:57,730 --> 00:43:59,770
Oh my god, guys, he's back on silo.

689
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:00,330
Maybe?

690
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:01,370
Maybe?

691
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:04,810
Oh, okay, that's not good, but...

692
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:07,490
Maybe?

693
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:10,790
All right.

694
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:12,330
All right, guys.

695
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:14,730
Everything is okay.

696
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:18,060
I got a little too... I might have got a little too cocky,
but...

697
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:19,750
Everything might be okay.

698
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:25,530
I definitely might have got a little cocky there.

699
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:29,190
Okay, he has all...

700
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:30,910
That silox looking for that shit.

701
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:32,990
Oh my god.

702
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:34,790
He's gonna...

703
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:36,770
I'm gonna put that in just in case.

704
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:37,950
I can't peek.

705
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:40,090
Okay, there...

706
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:41,850

710
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:48,730

711
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:50,550
So I'm scared.

712
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:56,330

It's okay.

721
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:41,410

723
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:45,230
We actually stabilized We what the fuck?

724
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:54,310
I did not expect that I did not expect the stabilization Did

725
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:55,810
No, don't say that.

726
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:02,930
What the fuck?

727
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:04,450
How did you get damage there?

728
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:06,810
I just wanted the extra.

729
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:09,030
Oh my god.

730
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:12,990
Guys, there is a flanker right there.

00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:17,690
Like, how is he allowed?

There we go.

735
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:22,090
Fuck this.

736
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:24,830
Yeah, yeah, like you should not be allowed to do that.

737
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:30,210
Like it's just that easy Not be allowed to do that.

738
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:35,730
He absolutely should not be allowed I was like get out of
here

739
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:44,290
There you go Yeah, no, I had to take care of that myself.

740
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:47,250
I was like bro this guy should not be allowed to do this
shit.

741
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:58,870
He's doing Okay, okay, bro Okay, there is no way that they
let me die like that.

742
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:00,870
There is no way.

743
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:04,630
Bro, okay, that is my team.

744
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:09,690
My team literally fucking just not do anything.

745
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:11,170
Bro,

746
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:17,150
I can't believe my team actually...

747
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:20,150
Like, my team just let him walk past everyone.

748
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:24,510
I should have just walked to my team and let everyone die if
he's going to do that.

749
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:25,690
Tanaya Iron Fist.

750
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:28,670
I think I gotta kill their front line really easy.

751
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:32,910
He's like, I'm just gonna...

752
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:36,770
And you should play Mag, because I'm pretty sure their
Helo's, like, soft toggled.

753
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:38,810
You should just play Double Tent.

754
00:47:38,810 --> 00:47:39,530
Play Mag.

755
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:42,750
The Magneto character.

756
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:45,110
I'm not worried about the Helo, though.

757
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:47,950
I'm worried about their front line running our back line
down.

758
00:47:48,810 --> 00:47:50,450
I mean, I'm getting...

759
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:51,830
Our front line doesn't matter what that guy's doing.

760
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:54,010
Our other support just ran away from our other support.

761
00:47:54,630 --> 00:48:02,110
brother bro so like i'm fine all right yeah can you put
something else with something bro no more earthquake okay

762
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:05,710
our no more is fucking doing like i bro

763
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:21,590
i've seen that account some sort of level what the i've seen
i've seen that account for weeks in this rank though why i'm

764
00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:27,190
giving her a different account soft toggle is that you can
adjust You can adjust cheats to make it look like you're not

765
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:28,530
hacking specifically.

766
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:31,290
That's what soft toggling is.

767
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:34,970
You can adjust cheats to like, like have misses and stuff.

768
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:41,810
Because like, people who pay for subscription for cheats can
hard, like can customize it.

769
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:44,850
Which is fucking crazy that that is a thing.

770
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:46,070
But...

771
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:47,430
Hello?

772
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:49,270

815
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,840
You'll need a top-notch team to win this one.

They swapped the sides.

859
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:23,340
Bro, it's not his fault.

860
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,660

Heroes.

because like you know um if i suffer i like okay this is my

893
00:56:43,530 --> 00:56:51,470
logic also if anyone asked me one to play sometimes i like
mostly always say yes um um and because like i'm not

894
00:56:51,470 --> 00:56:57,190
grinding for a rank or anything anymore i'm not grinding for
a rank or anything anymore so it doesn't really matter if i

895
00:56:57,190 --> 00:57:08,090
lose yellow or not um unless i lose a lot of either then it
matters um for offstream the thing is I usually I don't solo

896
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:15,630
queue off stream mostly mostly because it's like uh because
like for stream I solo queue I have no mind solo queuing

897
00:57:15,630 --> 00:57:21,650
because like you know you guys are suffering with me but off
stream I'm like I need someone to stuff you know you're like

898
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:30,010
I don't want to suffer alone so I'm like I have to have
someone to like fucking suffer with me I need to bring

899
00:57:30,010 --> 00:57:38,950
someone down with me to this hellhole but like when I'm
streaming I'm like at least you guys are to madness um yeah

944
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:14,690
No, that's a lie.

945
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:15,930
My subway card.

946
01:01:16,050 --> 01:01:17,670
Oh, you spam it until it works.

947
01:01:18,890 --> 01:01:19,670
Okay, that's okay.

948
01:01:21,730 --> 01:01:24,350
What the fuck is going on in my chat?

949
01:01:25,770 --> 01:01:28,130
Because Sep is trying to find me.

950
01:01:31,770 --> 01:01:32,290
Alright.

951
01:01:32,890 --> 01:01:33,910
Oh my god.

952
01:01:34,350 --> 01:01:35,910
Why is trust me GM?

953
01:01:36,390 --> 01:01:37,130
Oh, I'm...

954
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:38,790
What GM do you think you want to be here?

955
01:01:41,070 --> 01:01:52,470
oh my god he's fucking doing placements on his 20th account
right now god damn it doing fucking placements on his like

956
01:01:52,470 --> 01:02:05,270
20th account oh trust me is uh he was he won the guanjo land
not the million dollar the one um he's he's a really good

957
01:02:05,270 --> 01:02:12,210
tank player that should not be in gm1 is 25 for this.

958
01:02:12,870 --> 01:02:15,090
Because majority of players here are GM players.

959
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:18,250
So that's the one that sucks the most.

960
01:02:21,450 --> 01:02:21,690
I don't know.

961
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:24,490
It's fine if it's like a majority Celestial Lobby.

962
01:02:25,090 --> 01:02:28,130
But half the people here are GM.

963
01:02:29,870 --> 01:02:30,310
We.

964
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:33,750
Easy.

965
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:44,020
I assume he's just doing placements on his 20th account.

966
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:44,620
Oh, and they back.

967
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,980
Damn it, the fuck am I gonna play now?

968
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:48,880
We have three support plate.

969
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:52,940
Alright.

970
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:54,920
Guess I'm Mantis.

971
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:07,370
I mean, I'll play Mantis with triple support.

972
01:03:09,110 --> 01:03:09,610
Banning Moon Knight.

973
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:12,070
Who the fuck banned Moon Knight?

974
01:03:14,330 --> 01:03:18,530
Banning Moon Knight is so true, but I forgive you because
you're GM1.

975
01:03:19,850 --> 01:03:21,190
Why did we not ban Hella?

976
01:03:21,570 --> 01:03:22,830
Oh, I just noticed.

977
01:03:23,530 --> 01:03:25,710
I laughed, but I'm also crying.

978
01:03:26,290 --> 01:03:28,350
Because I realized what we banned over Hella.

979
01:03:29,050 --> 01:03:31,430
What we banned over Hella.

980
01:03:35,010 --> 01:03:37,250
I was like, wait, you're right.

981
01:03:37,690 --> 01:03:39,250
Why didn't we ban Hella?

982
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:44,880
Yeah.

983
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:50,860
Maybe it was for me, blushes.

984
01:03:57,940 --> 01:04:02,120
Hellenic Moore is gonna make me very upset, but it's okay.

985
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:06,540
Yeah, I stream on Twitch too.

986
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,240
I mean, I do like guerrilla streams here.

987
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:15,120
I don't know if he's gonna make it before.

988
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:17,660
You know, I trust the Venom to make it in time.

989
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:19,120
Never mind.

990
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:21,080
Here's another damage boost just in case.

991
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:22,820
And also you.

992
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:24,420
Come on, Venom!

993
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:24,980
Come on!

994
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:27,340
Come on, Venom.

995
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:30,160
I was expecting you to dive in already.

996
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:32,540
I gave... Okay, there we go.

997
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:32,900
There we go.

998
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:36,220
There's the damage boost that I was waiting for.

999
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:39,860
Oh, no.

1000
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:40,480
Hey, guys.

1001
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:41,720
Hey, there's a... Wow.

1002
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:46,900
Oh, we lost... We lost Wolf.

1003
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:50,060
Oh, my... Oh, hey!

1004
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:50,680
Guess what?

1005
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,880
They ran a real DPS cop.

1006
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:57,040
That's cool.

1007
01:04:58,020 --> 01:04:58,860
How did they...

1008
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:01,380
How did they have a Hell in the More player?

1009
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,820
Like, oh my god, this is rigged.

1010
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:05,340
This is actually rigged.

1011
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:08,300
This is scripted.

1012
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:09,440
There is no way.

1013
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:11,020
This is scripted.

1014
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:19,740
Like, how did they coincidentally have Hell in the More
players when we don't even have Hell in the More players?

1015
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:23,880
It's definitely scripted as hell.

1016
01:05:25,620 --> 01:05:27,000
Like, There's no way.

1017
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:30,240
Our fucking DPS player is a Punisher.

1018
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:32,200
Fuck it.

1019
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:32,820
Let's go.

1020
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:35,460
Let's go.

1021
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:36,880
Let's go.

1022
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:38,000
Come on.

1023
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:39,160
Come on.

1024
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:40,300
I ulted.

1025
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:41,080
Come on.

1026
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:42,520
Oh, okay.

1027
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:43,300
That's cool.

1028
01:05:47,540 --> 01:05:48,740
Oh, nice.

1029
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:49,900
They double support ulted.

1030
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:50,960
That's cool.

1031
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:52,320
I wish I...

1032
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:53,280
Oh, that's not cool.

1033
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:53,640
That's not...

1034
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:53,840
Okay.

1035
01:05:54,860 --> 01:05:55,460
Alright.

1036
01:05:55,620 --> 01:05:56,220
That's a...

1037
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:56,620
Alright.

1038
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:00,480
Oh wait, they don't have any support.

1039
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:04,840
Not even minus 20, it's minus 26.

1040
01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:09,860
I don't understand.

1041
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:11,280
This is fully scripted.

1042
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:13,160
I refuse to believe.

1043
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:15,980
They're paid actors.

1044
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:17,480
These are fucking paid actors.

1045
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:18,400
There's no way.

1046
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:21,560
There's no way.

1047
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:26,100
Oh my god, go, go, go.

1048
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:32,920
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, come
on, I even fucking, okay, that's fine, that's fine, that's

1049
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:40,560
fine, that's fine, back up, back up, breaks, breaks, breaks,
breaks, breaks, breaks, breaks, breaks, breaks, breaks,

1050
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:52,740
breaks, breaks, breaks, all right, no, this is, no, I don't
think it's possible, guys, I, I, oh, I'm sorry, Mac, there

1051
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:58,980
was nothing I could do, I'm sorry, Mac, It's cooked.

1052
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:08,500
He definitely didn't.

1053
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:09,820
He actually had...

1054
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:11,820
It's actually like paid actors.

1055
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:14,600
I refuse to believe that like...

1056
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:20,220
Not only did they get Trust Me, but also they got a name
more in Hella Player.

1057
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:22,040
And what the fuck did we get?

1058
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:28,260
What did we get?

1059
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:30,420
We didn't get out of those.

1060
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:32,360
Technically, I could play Cloak for this.

1061
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,080
They didn't have a mag, right?

1062
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:38,160
Yeah, they didn't have a mag, so it's cloak time.

1063
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:42,500
It's not winnable, but I like to pretend to...

1064
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:44,580
I like to pretend it is.

1065
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:50,320
Yeah.

1066
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:51,880
It's okay.

01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:53,240
Like, oh, this is not.

1293
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:23,660
i'll go i okay i'm just a little sad that my team like saw
the uh and just actually what the fuck are the indigo i'm

1294
01:29:23,660 --> 01:29:36,180
just i'm just wondering why we all just paused wait they
haven't popped anything we were all just standing there i

1295
01:29:36,180 --> 01:29:48,450
wanted to use it aggressively there we go okay but they have
multiple alts that are gonna like keep killing us that we

1296
01:29:48,450 --> 01:29:53,850
need to react like defensively to and even then using
aggressively we actually have to be able to walk as a team

1297
01:29:53,850 --> 01:30:00,650
you are popping it so far up that we are losing four seconds
before anybody and it's only me who's even standing in it we

1298
01:30:00,650 --> 01:30:07,930
they're all four of us okay i'm not gonna argue i'm not
gonna argue all four of us were fucking in front of the y

1299
01:30:07,930 --> 01:30:19,310
'all and we didn't move up i'm not even gonna argue with him
like this guy like we all literally just stared at it we

1300
01:30:19,310 --> 01:30:29,660
stared at the y'all i was just trying to pull a cyphe
because he uses his invisible aggressively i'm not i'm he's

1301
01:30:29,660 --> 01:30:31,740
been hard stuck in this Halo in a long time.

1302
01:30:31,860 --> 01:30:33,120
I'm not going to argue with him.

1303
01:30:34,260 --> 01:30:35,840
He plays this game so much.

1304
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:37,540
I'm not going to argue with him.

1305
01:30:43,100 --> 01:30:45,440
He is actually, I'm not going to get rage baited.

1306
01:30:47,020 --> 01:30:49,460
Yeah, I can't reason with a movable object.

1307
01:30:51,380 --> 01:30:56,980
Like, did we not see a rocket fucking all of Phoenix up two
times?

1308
01:30:57,280 --> 01:30:57,840
But, oh, yeah.

1309
01:30:58,140 --> 01:30:59,040
Like, we were so lucky.

1310
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:00,960
We all fucking shot the Phoenix up.

1311
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:02,900
Much better.

1312
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:06,820
They were so scared to walk forward.

1313
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:08,720
That's the thing.

1314
01:31:09,220 --> 01:31:11,000
Everyone was so scared to walk forward.

1315
01:31:11,260 --> 01:31:11,900
Like, all...

1316
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:15,320
Like, I saw we were all in front of the Ups.

1317
01:31:16,140 --> 01:31:18,440
But then nobody moved forward.

1318
01:31:20,700 --> 01:31:21,380
Like...

1319
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:24,540
Hey, I'm not gonna...

1320
01:31:25,180 --> 01:31:26,700
I saw what I saw.

1321
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:31,180
I saw what I saw.

1322
01:31:33,540 --> 01:31:34,680
All right, nice side ahead.

1323
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:36,220
What the fuck?

1324
01:31:36,540 --> 01:31:38,300
Who's feeding this up?

1325
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:40,160
Oh, yeah?

1326
01:31:40,360 --> 01:31:41,040
Oh, look at that.

1327
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:42,000
Look at this Invis.

1328
01:31:42,140 --> 01:31:45,680
Use it aggressively instead of defensively.

1329
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:46,800
Oh, yeah.

1330
01:31:55,470 --> 01:31:56,570
Oh, yeah.

1331
01:31:56,890 --> 01:31:59,670
Oh, how come they were able to walk forward?

1332
01:32:03,630 --> 01:32:04,770
Oh, yeah.

1333
01:32:05,330 --> 01:32:05,570
Oh, yeah.

1334
01:32:10,410 --> 01:32:16,010
That's the thing, I see a lot of like high rank invisible,
like the pro invisible players.

1335
01:32:16,530 --> 01:32:19,690
What they do is literally they use your invisible
aggressively.

1336
01:32:28,860 --> 01:32:31,140
Alright, I'll use it.

1337
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:33,800
Oh, there you go.

1338
01:32:34,420 --> 01:32:36,800
I have to use the, oh look at that, I'm walking forward.

1339
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,340
Oh, you live, yep, look you live.

1340
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:50,440
Whoa, guess who saved the rocket guys?

1341
01:32:54,240 --> 01:32:55,920
Whoa, oh, I'm dead.

1342
01:32:58,660 --> 01:32:59,540
It's fine.

1343
01:33:00,940 --> 01:33:02,020
Just press W.

1344
01:33:03,660 --> 01:33:06,020
I don't even know where people... Oh, he's so dead.

1345
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:08,240
He's yeah, we're not... he's not saveable.

1346
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:17,400
No, I just think...

1347
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:18,140
Oh.

1348
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:20,040
Oh, nice.

1349
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:20,720
See, look at that.

1350
01:33:20,820 --> 01:33:21,380
I saved him.

1351
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:22,720
You're welcome.

1352
01:33:24,860 --> 01:33:27,940
Oh, guess who just saved his fucking life?

1353
01:33:28,740 --> 01:33:29,080
Wow!

1354
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:34,380
Yeah, but I'm the one reason why we lost that game.

1355
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:37,740
Oh, hey guys.

1356
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:43,680
Okay, I tried my best to save this guy.

1357
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:45,340
I had all...

1358
01:33:45,340 --> 01:33:48,180
I had every fucking... I shielded him and everything.

1359
01:33:57,860 --> 01:33:58,500
Oh, and then...

1360
01:33:58,520 --> 01:34:02,860
Oh, I lost the slack game.

1361
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:08,020
Oh, see, this is what I hate.

1362
01:34:08,160 --> 01:34:16,840
You make, and quote unquote, one mistake, and then, like,
everyone's fucking dog pales you, and then I'm just like,

1363
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:22,340
okay, why wouldn't we push in at any of our other fights?

1364
01:34:22,660 --> 01:34:25,080
How did we lose all our other fights?

1365
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:27,440
Yeah.

1366
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:34,800
Like, oh, I fucking blocked the spotter, man.

1367
01:34:35,460 --> 01:34:38,440
Yeah, 4-7 DPS is the problem.

1368
01:34:38,820 --> 01:34:40,640
But Doki is the problem.

1369
01:34:45,140 --> 01:34:46,400
Oh, yeah, I got it with a DPS.

1370
01:34:47,340 --> 01:34:47,860
You're right.

1371
01:34:49,260 --> 01:34:56,880
No, I honestly, I think, I do think that Rivals is getting
more and more toxic in terms of, like, playing rank.

1372
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:59,320
I saw a lot of people saying that they stopped playing rank.

1373
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:03,500
Like, people are being toxic and quick play in general, too.

1374
01:35:04,820 --> 01:35:06,380
And I can see that.

1375
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:13,460
I will say the toxicity in Rivals is, like, almost at the
same level as Valorant now.

1376
01:35:15,220 --> 01:35:17,340
Which sucks, because I do like, I love this game.

1377
01:35:17,620 --> 01:35:24,860
But, like, the players in this game, some of the players in
this game, the fucking ego, and, like, they don't see people

1378
01:35:24,860 --> 01:35:25,500
as people.

1379
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:28,180
Like, that's what I hate the most.

1380
01:35:31,180 --> 01:35:32,020
people anymore.

1381
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,220
No, it has got really bad.

1382
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:43,260
Like, that's why it's like, usually I'd, like, go on a whole
spiel about that fucking guy that was trying to blame on me,

1383
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:46,220
but I was just like, I'm not gonna argue with you.

1384
01:35:46,340 --> 01:35:47,220
Like, bro, fuck it off.

1385
01:35:47,580 --> 01:35:47,580
Like,

1386
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:58,680
I know you've been hard stuck around this Elo for a while
now.

1387
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:02,080
Like, I've seen you around since when I, like, fuck around.

1388
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:04,760
For so long.

1389
01:36:07,540 --> 01:36:08,520
Alright, that's okay.

1390
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:10,540
There's one thing that will always cheer me up.

1391
01:36:12,620 --> 01:36:13,580
This time.

1392
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:22,060
Yeah, there's quick play players that are now behaving like
rank and stuff.

1393
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:25,360
That's why I'm trying to be more... I'm trying to be more
chill.

1394
01:36:25,980 --> 01:36:26,940
I'm trying!

1395
01:36:27,380 --> 01:36:29,380
I'm trying to be more chill.

1396
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:30,740
I'm like, I'm not gonna argue with you.

1397
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:31,460
I...

1398
01:36:32,820 --> 01:36:34,400
I'm impervious to damage.

1399
01:36:37,380 --> 01:36:49,900
I'm trying here Now I'm gonna dance my anger out Now we're
here to jingle jangle That's right Hello Can anyone pay

1400
01:36:49,900 --> 01:36:52,740
attention to me This is a cry for attention

1401
01:36:58,320 --> 01:37:10,340
This is a cry for attention right now I had a bad rank game
I mean i need i need people to pay attention to me

1402
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:21,400
i gotta shake out my anger i want to feel appreciated as a
support

1403
01:37:24,420 --> 01:37:29,040
yeah i desire human validation right now

1404
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:44,900
it's actually crazy that like they they the support when
like what did the dps do not for the last how many fights

1405
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:56,840
like you know we had three dps what the fuck did the dps do
oh but i ulced that badly so the entire reason why we lost

1406
01:37:56,840 --> 01:38:02,760
was because of that all right

1407
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:08,220
That's crazy.

1408
01:38:08,360 --> 01:38:15,440
He could have opened his mouth for any other moment to shit
to talk the DPS, but he chose to open his mouth to me

1409
01:38:23,710 --> 01:38:30,230
That's that's the crazy part he didn't have the balls to
fucking say anything else But then he had the balls to say

1410
01:38:30,230 --> 01:38:31,430
shit to the support

1411
01:38:36,750 --> 01:38:39,410
He thought he could oh my god, they're all console players.

1412
01:38:39,630 --> 01:38:43,570
What the fuck like Holy shit!

1413
01:38:43,910 --> 01:38:44,990
It's just console.

1414
01:38:46,350 --> 01:38:47,870
Look at all these console players.

1415
01:38:50,010 --> 01:38:51,670
This is why we had a support strike.

1416
01:38:52,610 --> 01:38:54,110
Don't make us bring it back.

1417
01:38:56,690 --> 01:38:57,250
It was...

1418
01:38:57,250 --> 01:38:59,070
I know for the people who...

1419
01:38:59,070 --> 01:39:06,550
I like accidentally was in the support strike only because I
wasn't playing rivals at that time because I was so busy.

1420
01:39:07,570 --> 01:39:09,490
So I didn't have to deal with the support strike.

1421
01:39:11,510 --> 01:39:12,950
Also because it was dive.

1422
01:39:13,370 --> 01:39:14,310
Dive fucking sucks.

1423
01:39:15,430 --> 01:39:16,630
I hate playing.

1424
01:39:18,690 --> 01:39:20,370
Which hero do you think you want to be...

1425
01:39:20,370 --> 01:39:23,070
Dive fucking sucked at that time.

1426
01:39:23,170 --> 01:39:24,710
It was like hard dive too.

1427
01:39:25,430 --> 01:39:26,770
So I'm fucking with that.

1428
01:39:27,190 --> 01:39:28,270
How many fantastic...

1429
01:39:28,270 --> 01:39:29,170
I swear to God.

1430
01:39:29,310 --> 01:39:31,650
This time is like fantastic hours.

1431
01:39:33,050 --> 01:39:37,100
How am I gonna vanish from this match?

1432
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:39,180
Okay, there is a player here.

1433
01:39:40,660 --> 01:39:41,780
That like...

1434
01:39:41,780 --> 01:39:43,460
Was a shitty person to me.

1435
01:39:43,640 --> 01:39:50,780
I'm gonna see if they'll I'm gonna see if they'll start
fucking be shitty being shitty again before I say anything

1436
01:39:56,010 --> 01:40:01,190
wasn't Necro's the reason for support strike it was also
because it was dive so like some people didn't even know

1437
01:40:01,190 --> 01:40:09,310
what Necro said they were just like dive sucked so like we
we all just stopped playing because dive was just not fun to

1438
01:40:09,310 --> 01:40:18,250
play like play against so a lot of support players was
because it was not fun at all

1439
01:40:25,880 --> 01:40:33,320
I won't say it until they be a shitty person because actions
have consequences because it's like you want to be a shitty

1440
01:40:33,320 --> 01:40:38,920
person well you got to deal with the consequences of being a
fucking shitty person like

1441
01:40:47,710 --> 01:40:59,590
yeah you like do you like like bullying people in this game
like oh then let's then be do it publicly Yeah, do it

1442
01:40:59,590 --> 01:41:00,850
publicly then

1443
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:14,640
I'm very petty That's why I was like If I'm gonna get flamed
I'm doing I might as well stream I might as well stream if

1444
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:21,040
I'm getting flamed You know Because at least At least I can
make content out of it

1445
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:34,290
At least I'll get like You know of income from being yelled
at.

1446
01:41:37,140 --> 01:41:38,720
Never get flamed for free, guys.

1447
01:41:39,340 --> 01:41:41,040
Never get flamed for free.

1448
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:49,140
Yeah.

1449
01:41:56,140 --> 01:41:57,440
Words to live by.

1450
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:00,320

1451
01:42:00,640 --> 01:42:00,880

absolutely I will 100% actually get flamed for it.

1456

Like if I wasn't going to get flamed for it, I will for
Jeff.

There's so many things going on.

1489
01:43:57,940 --> 01:43:59,280
Oh, that widow now?

01:43:59,660 --> 01:44:00,260
Is that widow?

1491
01:44:00,520 --> 01:44:00,760
No.

1492
01:44:02,580 --> 01:44:02,960
Wait.

1493
01:44:03,100 --> 01:44:03,360
Okay.

1494
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:05,460
Okay, I got scared for him.

1495
01:44:09,620 --> 01:44:11,220
Okay, I'm gonna go here.

1496
01:44:11,860 --> 01:44:12,900
I'm scared here.

1497
01:44:13,200 --> 01:44:14,120
Yep, that's why I was scared.

1498
01:44:14,380 --> 01:44:14,700
That's why.

1499
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:17,120
That was why I was scared.

1500
01:44:17,660 --> 01:44:17,940
Oh,

1501
01:44:22,450 --> 01:44:22,670
wait.

1502
01:44:22,810 --> 01:44:23,350
Oh, no.

1503
01:44:24,250 --> 01:44:24,810
Oh, no.

1504
01:44:24,990 --> 01:44:25,470
He's dead.

1505
01:44:26,190 --> 01:44:26,690
He is dead.

1506
01:44:27,010 --> 01:44:27,990
Does he still have...

1507
01:44:27,990 --> 01:44:29,350
Does he still have his ult?

1508
01:44:29,490 --> 01:44:31,070
Oh, he ults it too early.

1509
01:44:31,550 --> 01:44:33,350
Why did you ult so early?

1510
01:44:35,510 --> 01:44:36,470
Oh, no.

1511
01:44:36,930 --> 01:44:37,290
Oh, no.

1512
01:44:38,850 --> 01:44:41,150
I thought I thought the old was still there.

1513
01:44:41,230 --> 01:44:51,990
I don't know the counting for it I wish I knew the counting
for the old stuff I'm so bad at counting for the thing It's

1514
01:44:51,990 --> 01:44:55,510
okay Oh my god, it's not okay.

1515
01:44:56,470 --> 01:44:58,070
Oh, it's not okay.

1516
01:44:58,150 --> 01:45:00,910
I wanted to go in and stall a little longer

1517
01:45:04,130 --> 01:45:04,810
It's okay.

1518
01:45:04,950 --> 01:45:06,390
We have oh goodbye.

1519
01:45:06,930 --> 01:45:07,370
Goodbye Adam.

1520
01:45:07,890 --> 01:45:08,490
Oh, unless

1521
01:45:14,720 --> 01:45:15,400
All right.

1522
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:18,100
Everything is fine.

1523
01:45:21,630 --> 01:45:23,530
I don't know anymore.

1524
01:45:24,010 --> 01:45:25,190
No, that's not fine.

1525
01:45:25,730 --> 01:45:27,090
We don't have else for it.

1526
01:45:27,830 --> 01:45:29,990
We don't have else for that.

1527
01:45:33,130 --> 01:45:35,030
That's why it might not be fine.

1528
01:45:37,730 --> 01:45:40,030
Oh, yeah, I was going to say we don't have else for that.

1529
01:45:52,910 --> 01:45:53,530
It's okay.

1530
01:46:04,380 --> 01:46:12,240
Do you only add Pufasa 9 L has left the voice chat?

1531
01:46:12,680 --> 01:46:13,400
Okay, you can do that.

1532
01:46:13,740 --> 01:46:13,740
Okay.

1533
01:46:13,940 --> 01:46:17,100
That's... Why did he leave the voice chat?

1534
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:21,420
Incredible.

1535
01:46:22,020 --> 01:46:23,040
That's crazy.

1536
01:46:27,080 --> 01:46:28,660
That's crazy.

1537
01:46:35,010 --> 01:46:35,610
Okay.

1538
01:46:37,110 --> 01:46:38,090
I love Rivals.

1539
01:46:38,490 --> 01:46:40,210
I love Marvel Rivals.

1540
01:46:41,670 --> 01:46:42,790
That's crazy.

1541
01:46:43,090 --> 01:46:45,050
That's actually crazy.

1542
01:46:53,310 --> 01:46:56,970
I mean, come on, let's go.

1543
01:46:59,370 --> 01:46:59,850
Let's go.

1544
01:47:00,330 --> 01:47:00,470
Let's go.

1545
01:47:01,490 --> 01:47:01,730
Let's go.

1546
01:47:01,730 --> 01:47:02,210
What the fuck?

1547
01:47:02,970 --> 01:47:03,290
Come on.

1548
01:47:03,790 --> 01:47:05,450
You should be able to do stuff with that, right?

1549
01:47:06,050 --> 01:47:06,350
Nice.

1550
01:47:07,530 --> 01:47:08,090
Jesus.

1551
01:47:08,630 --> 01:47:09,490
Okay, guys, guys.

1552
01:47:09,650 --> 01:47:11,170
I think we won the fight, guys.

1553
01:47:11,770 --> 01:47:12,070
Guys, guys.

1554
01:47:12,710 --> 01:47:13,410
Guys, guys.

1555
01:47:14,430 --> 01:47:14,850
No, guys.

1556
01:47:15,110 --> 01:47:19,250
I think, guys, I really think we might have won the fight,
guys.

1557
01:47:20,750 --> 01:47:22,510
Oh my god.

1558
01:47:22,730 --> 01:47:22,870
Okay.

1559
01:47:23,370 --> 01:47:23,370
Okay.

1560
01:47:23,510 --> 01:47:24,570
That's, whoa.

1561
01:47:24,930 --> 01:47:27,210
Um, that's okay.

1562
01:47:27,730 --> 01:47:31,150
Um, I don't know.

1563
01:47:31,210 --> 01:47:38,590
I had a feeling that the fight was 100 already, That's okay
guys.

1564
01:47:42,610 --> 01:47:44,170
Oh my god.

1565
01:47:44,490 --> 01:47:44,630
Alright.

1566
01:47:46,950 --> 01:47:48,270
I think it was fine.

1567
01:47:49,270 --> 01:47:50,490
Okay, I'm going in here.

1568
01:47:53,150 --> 01:47:53,190
Okay.

1569
01:47:56,430 --> 01:47:57,690
Okay, nice.

1570
01:48:02,220 --> 01:48:02,900
I...

1571
01:48:04,440 --> 01:48:06,140
It's fine, I think.

1572
01:48:08,140 --> 01:48:08,660
Okay.

1573
01:48:12,610 --> 01:48:13,610
Are we...

1574
01:48:13,610 --> 01:48:14,070
Is this winnable?

1575
01:48:14,570 --> 01:48:15,470
You know what, fuck it.

1576
01:48:15,630 --> 01:48:16,830
Let's fucking do this.

1577
01:48:17,610 --> 01:48:18,130
Okay.

1578
01:48:18,610 --> 01:48:19,790
Guys, guys, it's okay.

1579
01:48:20,250 --> 01:48:20,670
It's okay.

1580
01:48:20,770 --> 01:48:21,870
They all did for it.

1581
01:48:21,930 --> 01:48:22,370
You know what?

1582
01:48:22,410 --> 01:48:22,970
That's fine.

1583
01:48:23,310 --> 01:48:23,950
That's fine.

1584
01:48:24,250 --> 01:48:25,870
We got the Groot alt out.

1585
01:48:27,610 --> 01:48:31,930
It wasn't a winnable fight, but we got the Groot alt out.

1586
01:48:32,190 --> 01:48:34,810
Like, that's a trade I'm willing to make.

1587
01:48:37,250 --> 01:48:38,090
It's fine.

1588
01:48:38,190 --> 01:48:39,490
We got the Groot alt out.

1589
01:48:39,610 --> 01:48:40,970
Guys, that's okay.

1590
01:48:41,430 --> 01:48:42,070
That's okay.

1591
01:48:42,130 --> 01:48:43,290
I'm okay with that.

1592
01:48:45,390 --> 01:48:46,590
What the fuck?

1593
01:48:46,910 --> 01:48:47,130
How?

1594
01:48:47,310 --> 01:48:48,210
Oh my god.

1595
01:48:49,550 --> 01:48:51,690
I was like, where am I getting hit from?

1596
01:48:56,910 --> 01:48:58,250
I gotta slowly back up.

1597
01:48:58,450 --> 01:48:59,070
Sorry, guys.

1598
01:49:03,940 --> 01:49:06,280
I think I can maybe grab my load in time.

1599
01:49:07,640 --> 01:49:10,560
Bro, okay, there's this fucking arm fist that's just
punching our exchange.

1600
01:49:10,700 --> 01:49:12,060
Can we, like, do something about that?

1601
01:49:15,660 --> 01:49:17,720
Man, I wish we had Jeff players.

1602
01:49:18,900 --> 01:49:20,940
That would be pretty cool about now.

1603
01:49:23,780 --> 01:49:24,200
Okay, nice.

1604
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:29,680
I mean, it would be fucking cool if we...

1605
01:49:29,680 --> 01:49:30,600
Oh, no.

1606
01:49:30,680 --> 01:49:31,640
I don't know about this.

1607
01:49:31,720 --> 01:49:32,960
I don't know about this.

1608
01:49:33,480 --> 01:49:34,340
Okay, nice.

1609
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:39,100
That's fine.

1610
01:49:39,380 --> 01:49:39,800
He just...

1611
01:49:39,800 --> 01:49:40,340
That's okay.

1612
01:49:41,020 --> 01:49:41,620
That's good.

1613
01:49:42,980 --> 01:49:43,500
Okay.

1614
01:49:46,910 --> 01:49:48,370
Oh shit!

1615
01:49:49,330 --> 01:49:51,050
Okay, I don't want to use this yet.

1616
01:49:51,670 --> 01:49:53,250
But so I'm hoping that...

1617
01:49:53,250 --> 01:49:53,570
Okay, nice.

1618
01:49:53,770 --> 01:49:55,210
I don't have to use a...

1619
01:49:55,210 --> 01:49:55,730
Nice, see?

1620
01:49:55,970 --> 01:49:56,450
I...

1621
01:49:56,450 --> 01:49:57,110
Self-restraint!

1622
01:49:59,750 --> 01:50:01,690
Self- oh my god, guys, guys.

1623
01:50:03,090 --> 01:50:03,750
He's one.

1624
01:50:05,610 --> 01:50:07,170
Self-restraint, I did it all.

1625
01:50:10,670 --> 01:50:12,570
Okay, I'm a bit afraid of.

1626
01:50:16,980 --> 01:50:17,460
Oh.

1627
01:50:19,220 --> 01:50:20,560
Oh my god.

1628
01:50:20,700 --> 01:50:22,500
Please tell us we live this.

1629
01:50:22,780 --> 01:50:25,560
Dang it, that's good.

1630
01:50:26,460 --> 01:50:27,080
That is good.

1631
01:50:28,720 --> 01:50:31,000
That is, I had to use this because I don't know.

1632
01:50:32,700 --> 01:50:33,510
I actually fell down.

1633
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:38,020
Oh my god, please.

1634
01:50:38,340 --> 01:50:39,480
Please tell me we're...

1635
01:50:39,480 --> 01:50:42,040
Oh no, oh no, we were all stuck in there.

1636
01:50:43,600 --> 01:50:44,500
Alright, it's okay.

1637
01:50:44,780 --> 01:50:47,920
Surely we have a strange that can pour it up.

1638
01:50:49,200 --> 01:50:50,140
This is fine.

1639
01:50:50,700 --> 01:51:03,900
fine we have a strange portal and then i go this and then i
i try and body block i i try my what the fuck where's our

1640
01:51:03,900 --> 01:51:18,320
portal where's our where's our portal where did our portal
go okay that's fine that's fine oh they didn't touch point

1641
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:25,640
that was not fine You know, the thing is, even if they
counter-portaled, the portal should still show up.

1642
01:51:25,720 --> 01:51:27,460
So I'm like, what happened?

1643
01:51:30,550 --> 01:51:32,990
The portal should still show up.

1644
01:51:37,300 --> 01:51:38,260
That's the thing.

1645
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:42,560
I don't understand why the portal didn't show up.

1646
01:51:43,060 --> 01:51:51,420
Like, did he, like, stop the portal accidentally?

1647
01:51:53,940 --> 01:51:55,700
Yeah, no, I look behind.

1648
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:57,220
There was no second portal.

1649
01:51:59,660 --> 01:52:00,540
He got tired.

1650
01:52:00,820 --> 01:52:02,000
Like, I was so confused.

1651
01:52:02,140 --> 01:52:06,600
Because, like, even if you get counter portal, another
portal should...

1652
01:52:06,600 --> 01:52:07,300
He should still...

1653
01:52:07,300 --> 01:52:08,360
No, he didn't get stunned.

1654
01:52:08,860 --> 01:52:09,980
He didn't get stunned.

1655
01:52:10,160 --> 01:52:10,940
That's the thing.

1656
01:52:11,820 --> 01:52:13,060
He canceled it.

1657
01:52:14,140 --> 01:52:16,640
I was like, where did our portal go?

1658
01:52:17,580 --> 01:52:19,020
How did it get canceled?

1659
01:52:21,180 --> 01:52:22,320
Does it not work?

1660
01:52:22,640 --> 01:52:22,940
Does it...

1661
01:52:22,940 --> 01:52:24,560
No, I don't know what happened.

1662
01:52:24,680 --> 01:52:25,440
I was so confused.

1663
01:52:25,760 --> 01:52:30,940
Even if a strange counter portals you, a second port- He
should still be able to put up the portal.

1664
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:34,320
You just have to- You should be able to see the other
portal.

1665
01:52:34,520 --> 01:52:36,260
I mean, I could watch the POV, yeah.

1666
01:52:36,900 --> 01:52:37,700
Wouldn't hurt.

1667
01:52:44,230 --> 01:52:45,510
His arms got tied.

1668
01:52:45,630 --> 01:52:46,690
I was so confused.

1669
01:52:50,780 --> 01:52:51,800
Alright, let's see.

1670
01:52:55,360 --> 01:52:57,060
He stopped the portal!

1671
01:52:57,620 --> 01:53:00,240
Oh, my- No, wait, did he actually get hit by Phoenix?

1672
01:53:00,580 --> 01:53:01,940
Where was the Phoenix?

1673
01:53:05,080 --> 01:53:06,140
Wait, what?

1674
01:53:09,220 --> 01:53:11,420
How did he get hit by the Phoenix?

1675
01:53:12,840 --> 01:53:13,040
Ha!

1676
01:53:13,220 --> 01:53:14,380
Okay, wait, I gotta see.

1677
01:53:14,600 --> 01:53:16,160
How did he get hit by the Phoenix?

1678
01:53:19,580 --> 01:53:20,560
Where's our Phoenix?

1679
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:21,740
Oh, it's here.

1680
01:53:25,580 --> 01:53:26,940
How did he get hit?

1681
01:53:31,950 --> 01:53:32,830
Oh, my...

1682
01:53:32,830 --> 01:53:33,330
Oh.

1683
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:48,820
You can see it.

1684
01:53:49,300 --> 01:53:58,420
through the see it goes through the portal look look that
should have went through the portal so i couldn't see i

1685
01:53:58,420 --> 01:54:10,940
couldn't stand in front of it because there was the counter
portal he she did not plan this i wanted to i was trying to

1686
01:54:10,940 --> 01:54:16,820
stand in front of him and then the enemy portal showed up So
I couldn't stand in front of him anymore.

1687
01:54:18,260 --> 01:54:19,560
And then it hit him.

1688
01:54:20,940 --> 01:54:22,160
Oh my god.

1689
01:54:22,460 --> 01:54:24,380
That's actually so bullshit.

1690
01:54:26,980 --> 01:54:27,460
No, it's...

1691
01:54:27,460 --> 01:54:30,240
The portal came in at such a...

1692
01:54:30,240 --> 01:54:34,720
The portal came in at such a good timing.

1693
01:54:35,220 --> 01:54:36,040
Like, I don't think...

1694
01:54:36,040 --> 01:54:39,020
There's no way they planned this in fucking Celestial 3.

1695
01:54:39,340 --> 01:54:40,560

1773
02:00:34,510 --> 02:00:35,350
What happened?

1774
02:00:39,600 --> 02:00:42,060
Also, that Adam was not the problem.

1775
02:00:43,620 --> 02:00:44,820
problem at all.

1776
02:00:45,200 --> 02:00:47,000
It's literally...

1777
02:00:51,800 --> 02:00:55,640
That atom was not an issue at all, I will have to say.

1778
02:00:56,420 --> 02:00:58,980
Like, I literally shut down the atom so fast.

1779
02:01:01,220 --> 02:01:03,820
Trying to shut down near Spider-Man, too.

1780
02:01:04,240 --> 02:01:05,280
I wish it.

1781
02:01:07,660 --> 02:01:09,420
Okay, we gotta push up though.

1782
02:01:09,480 --> 02:01:11,000
Guys, guys, we can all be...

1783
02:01:14,140 --> 02:01:14,660
Okay.

1784
02:01:14,980 --> 02:01:16,240
I have to make sure.

1785
02:01:17,160 --> 02:01:17,340
Okay.

1786
02:01:18,300 --> 02:01:19,640
Okay, there we go.

1787
02:01:20,240 --> 02:01:21,000
There we go.

1788
02:01:21,340 --> 02:01:22,460
Can we touch point?

1789
02:01:22,780 --> 02:01:24,380
That'll be pretty cool.

1790
02:01:25,680 --> 02:01:26,200
Nice.

1791
02:01:29,220 --> 02:01:30,820
I'm proud of you all.

1792
02:01:35,370 --> 02:01:35,730
Alright.

1793
02:01:37,250 --> 02:01:38,670
Oh my god.

1794
02:01:42,090 --> 02:01:43,730
Okay, that's fine.

1795
02:01:44,370 --> 02:01:45,850
At least we live.

1796
02:01:46,270 --> 02:01:47,090
Some of us live.

1797
02:01:49,290 --> 02:01:53,150
This is a lot of orcs that we do not have to use.

1798
02:01:55,470 --> 02:01:56,890
Alright, that's fine.

1799
02:01:59,170 --> 02:02:00,990
Oh my god, I'm trying.

1800
02:02:01,490 --> 02:02:02,390
I really am.

1801
02:02:02,550 --> 02:02:03,990
I really am.

1802
02:02:08,130 --> 02:02:10,630
Oh my god, they're talking about this guy.

1803
02:02:10,810 --> 02:02:12,410
See, this guy was not an Atom OTP.

1804
02:02:13,030 --> 02:02:13,410
By the way.

1805
02:02:14,190 --> 02:02:16,450
I remember this guy was not an Atom OTP.

1806
02:02:19,910 --> 02:02:21,250
Oh, that is awkward.

1807
02:02:22,190 --> 02:02:22,870
Are you serious?

1808
02:02:23,090 --> 02:02:24,090
Oh, my God.

1809
02:02:25,550 --> 02:02:26,690
Okay, I talk shit.

1810
02:02:27,150 --> 02:02:27,690
I get it.

1811
02:02:27,750 --> 02:02:28,570
That's just karma.

1812
02:02:31,370 --> 02:02:32,450
I think there was just...

1813
02:02:32,450 --> 02:02:35,470
There's just too many alts to fucking counter with support
alts.

1814
02:02:36,010 --> 02:02:36,990
But we don't use our...

1815
02:02:36,990 --> 02:02:39,230
We don't use our cloak defensively.

1816
02:02:39,390 --> 02:02:40,530
Which is...

1817
02:02:40,530 --> 02:02:43,990
Fucked up because I have to use Gambit ult defensively.

1818
02:02:44,470 --> 02:02:47,050
Which is something I don't want to do.

1819
02:02:50,190 --> 02:02:55,810
there you go i saved this from that well i almost saved us
from that

1820
02:02:59,350 --> 02:03:05,250

02:03:23,390 --> 02:03:26,430
But we don't have a player that plays Hella?

1824
02:03:26,950 --> 02:03:30,990
Oh my god, I swear to god, this is like...

1825
02:03:32,470 --> 02:03:33,970
It's actually crazy.

1826
02:03:36,450 --> 02:03:37,870
How do we have all the players?

1827
02:03:38,110 --> 02:03:41,050
Like, how do we have all the unique one-tricks on our team?

1828
02:03:42,390 --> 02:03:42,890

02:07:52,880 --> 02:07:57,460
Wouldn't it be funny if you get all of them all grouped up
in one queue?

1865
02:07:57,820 --> 02:07:59,040
in one team.

1866
02:07:59,640 --> 02:08:00,280
It's like that.

1867
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:01,740
It's like that.

1868
02:08:02,020 --> 02:08:02,580
What was it?

1869
02:08:02,660 --> 02:08:03,860
I don't remember what game it is.

1870
02:08:04,780 --> 02:08:12,460
But there's a rank, there's a game where if you get reported
too much, they put you in your very own queue system where

1871
02:08:12,460 --> 02:08:15,680
you put all the hackers and shitty players go into.

1872
02:08:17,260 --> 02:08:19,260
I remember that was a real thing that they did.

1873
02:08:19,840 --> 02:08:21,160
I forgot what game it was.

1874
02:08:21,360 --> 02:08:28,060
There was a game where if you get reported enough, they put
you, we put all the people got reported into one kill.

1875
02:08:28,860 --> 02:08:31,160
So, like, all the hackers and everything, which is funny.

1876
02:08:32,100 --> 02:08:32,420
There you go.

1877
02:08:37,310 --> 02:08:39,230
Okay, it hits me out of everyone else.

1878
02:08:41,010 --> 02:08:44,770
Wasn't like, did my entire team pass through that?

1879
02:08:45,730 --> 02:08:51,890
My entire team passed through it, but yet somehow I'm the
one that hit gets hit.

1880
02:08:52,070 --> 02:08:53,610
That's crazy.

1881
02:08:56,770 --> 02:08:59,110
That's actually Like, what is my luck?

1882
02:09:03,750 --> 02:09:05,410
I wanted to give it to him.

1883
02:09:06,490 --> 02:09:08,050
This is gonna be hard to push through.

1884
02:09:10,730 --> 02:09:12,970
It's gonna be very hard to push through.

1885
02:09:14,710 --> 02:09:16,830
We might be able to build...

1886
02:09:16,830 --> 02:09:17,590
Oh my god.

1887
02:09:19,370 --> 02:09:20,410
Aw, he's lucky.

1888
02:09:23,010 --> 02:09:24,770
Okay, I'm just gonna try and heal.

1889
02:09:24,990 --> 02:09:25,750

I must have been a coincidence.

1995
02:19:36,280 --> 02:19:38,760

1996
02:19:42,620 --> 02:19:43,160
I mental?

1997
02:19:43,460 --> 02:19:45,180
I couldn't do this again.

1998
02:19:48,340 --> 02:19:59,120
um oh my god it was it was too much for me it was actually
too much i i was playing the babysitter but who was

1999
02:19:59,120 --> 02:20:11,060
babysitting me this was the most like amount of heals i had
to do on gambit because i always because like i had to i had

2000
02:20:11,060 --> 02:20:22,320
to rely on myself to heal and and and i had to use my e to
regenerate hp that was the worst part i the worst part was

2001
02:20:22,320 --> 02:20:36,660
because like usually i don't have to when you play gamut you
when usually usually you know when you get damage your

2002
02:20:36,660 --> 02:20:47,320
support would heal you but then i had to do this to heal
myself i i had to do that Oh, but that was not ideal.

2003
02:20:47,580 --> 02:20:48,920
That was absolutely not ideal.

2004
02:20:49,100 --> 02:20:50,740
I was not having a good time.

2005
02:20:51,120 --> 02:20:51,140
I

2006
02:20:54,440 --> 02:20:55,640
Oh my god.

2007
02:20:56,620 --> 02:20:58,160
I literally, I was a babysitter.

2008
02:20:58,500 --> 02:21:01,440
I, that cloak might have been like, wow, Gabba, you're
fucking terrible.

2009
02:21:01,640 --> 02:21:02,020
You're dying so much.

2010
02:21:02,040 --> 02:21:04,600
I'm like, yeah, you want to know why I was dying so much?

2011
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:09,620
You, yeah, yeah, you want to, you want to know why?

2012
02:21:14,060 --> 02:21:15,480
Oh my god, that was crazy.

2013
02:21:15,500 --> 02:21:26,040
crazy that that was not not a fun time I wonder why someone
was like Tybo you made this wood three people oh yeah yeah

trick and I'm like bro like the Adam was definitely not the

2016
02:21:46,560 --> 02:21:52,700
issue here you literally swapped off Adam he was not doing
anything

2017
02:21:57,960 --> 02:22:01,620
I can't believe that guy was afraid of the fucking Adam

2018
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:22,440
if anything it was free yeah it was it was literally free
kills on the reses oh my guy oh oh Oh my god, at least like,

teammate sort of also realized that Cloak was not it.

Oh my god, oh my...

2203
02:33:58,490 --> 02:33:59,010
Okay.

2204
02:33:59,050 --> 02:33:59,550
It's okay.

2205
02:34:00,110 --> 02:34:00,770
It's okay.

2206
02:34:00,890 --> 02:34:02,190
I'm still looking up.

2207
02:34:02,450 --> 02:34:02,650
You know what?

2208
02:34:02,650 --> 02:34:03,450
Let's use everything.

2209
02:34:03,630 --> 02:34:05,570
Let's fucking do it.

2210
02:34:07,350 --> 02:34:08,710
Let's fucking do it.

2211
02:34:09,050 --> 02:34:09,450
Let's fucking do it.

2212
02:34:09,770 --> 02:34:10,850
Thanks for the boost.

2213
02:34:11,330 --> 02:34:14,390
All right, guys, I can't believe it.

2214
02:34:14,430 --> 02:34:15,230
He was right.

2215
02:34:15,370 --> 02:34:17,770
We just gotta look up.

2216
02:34:20,330 --> 02:34:21,830
Who would have thought?

2217
02:34:22,690 --> 02:34:24,830
He was right all along.

2218
02:34:29,640 --> 02:34:31,500
Oh, my God.

2219
02:34:31,940 --> 02:34:32,940
Okay, it's fine.

2220
02:34:33,120 --> 02:34:33,260
It's fine.

2221
02:34:33,400 --> 02:34:33,520
It's fine.

2222
02:34:33,620 --> 02:34:35,740
He has this to fucking fight in.

2223
02:34:38,340 --> 02:34:38,980
Okay.

2224
02:34:39,680 --> 02:34:40,080
It's okay.

2225
02:34:40,080 --> 02:34:40,240
It's okay.

2226
02:34:40,380 --> 02:34:41,320
We're looking.

2227
02:34:41,500 --> 02:34:41,780
We're looking.

2228
02:34:41,920 --> 02:34:43,260
We have no support.

2229
02:34:43,280 --> 02:34:43,680
adults.

2230
02:34:44,400 --> 02:34:47,460
We have no support adults, guys.

2231
02:34:51,280 --> 02:34:53,260
No support adults, but that's okay.

2232
02:34:56,860 --> 02:34:57,540
I'm gonna be here.

2233
02:34:58,280 --> 02:35:01,420
I'm gonna be here so I can look up and heal here.

2234
02:35:07,500 --> 02:35:08,720
What the?

2235
02:35:15,270 --> 02:35:16,910
What the fuck?

2236
02:35:19,070 --> 02:35:19,870
Okay.

2237
02:35:20,310 --> 02:35:21,090
Okay.

2238
02:35:21,390 --> 02:35:24,250
What was that?

2239
02:35:29,050 --> 02:35:31,650
Why were they on me?

2240
02:35:32,150 --> 02:35:34,230
Not just wait, I was bucky-doo!

2241
02:35:38,370 --> 02:35:39,470
I was like, oh my god, we did it.

2242
02:35:39,550 --> 02:35:40,170
We looked up.

2243
02:35:40,670 --> 02:35:40,690
Guys!

2244
02:35:44,870 --> 02:35:45,050

2245
02:35:45,090 --> 02:35:46,130
We looked up.

2246
02:35:48,510 --> 02:35:50,310
We like did it.

2247
02:35:51,830 --> 02:35:53,230
Storm was right.

2248
02:35:53,710 --> 02:35:54,910
Who would have thought?

2249
02:35:55,750 --> 02:35:56,350
Damn

2250
02:36:00,610 --> 02:36:08,750

true I didn't look up hard enough and Bucky and widow

2251
02:36:08,750 --> 02:36:10,410
fucking both like me.

2252
02:36:10,870 --> 02:36:13,270
Oh and through that pain I get plus 17.

2253
02:36:13,690 --> 02:36:16,950
Yeah, that storm did not deserve to win that game.

2254
02:36:17,290 --> 02:36:21,430
No, my god Oh my fucking god.

2255
02:36:21,550 --> 02:36:23,090
Oh, I'm like I'm guys.

2256
02:36:23,170 --> 02:36:24,150
I'm dodging this queue.

2257
02:36:24,230 --> 02:36:29,550
I'm sorry You can call me a filthy Q dodger, but I'm not
playing that lobby again.

2258
02:36:29,830 --> 02:36:33,010
I am not playing that lobby again.

2259
02:36:33,330 --> 02:36:37,070
Now, I don't want any of them back there.

2260
02:36:42,710 --> 02:36:44,290
Oh, my God.

2261
02:36:45,970 --> 02:36:47,330
How much did the storm...

2262
02:36:47,330 --> 02:36:49,150
I bet you, like, plus 20-something.

2263
02:36:49,490 --> 02:36:50,310
I bet you.

2264
02:36:50,690 --> 02:36:52,050
I will never know.

2265
02:36:52,650 --> 02:36:55,070
I will never find you.

2266
02:36:55,090 --> 02:37:10,870
know I wish I did know but we'll never know we'll never have
the privilege to know oh my god how do you know DPS don't

2267
02:37:10,870 --> 02:37:23,690
think the DPS is all of it's all about me me me me me they
don't care about everyone they don't care oh my god that

2268
02:37:23,690 --> 02:37:26,050
fact that they're like, it's the support's fun.

2269
02:37:26,190 --> 02:37:27,410
I'm like, oh, okay.

2270
02:37:28,010 --> 02:37:28,530
Okay.

2271
02:37:30,130 --> 02:37:32,130
I was like, don't say it.

2272
02:37:32,390 --> 02:37:35,070
Like, okay, the moment he was like, what was it?

2273
02:37:35,850 --> 02:37:44,710
He was like, uh, wait, I wonder why they have support all
this first, guys.

2274
02:37:47,130 --> 02:37:47,650
Okay.

2275
02:37:48,450 --> 02:37:49,390
Here we go.

2276
02:37:52,670 --> 02:37:53,770
Where was it?

2277
02:37:54,830 --> 02:37:56,110
Oh, here you go.

2278
02:37:56,570 --> 02:37:57,110
It's simple.

2279
02:37:57,310 --> 02:38:00,110
The moment he was like, it's simple.

2280
02:38:00,250 --> 02:38:01,610
I was like, don't you say it.

2281
02:38:02,010 --> 02:38:04,110
Don't you there say it.

2282
02:38:04,570 --> 02:38:05,290
Don't.

2283
02:38:07,410 --> 02:38:07,590
Whoa.

2284
02:38:08,330 --> 02:38:08,870
Whoa.

2285
02:38:09,090 --> 02:38:11,570
Don't you fucking say it, bro.

2286
02:38:11,990 --> 02:38:13,550
And then he said it.

2287
02:38:13,710 --> 02:38:15,670
He fucking said it.

2288
02:38:16,110 --> 02:38:17,090
It's simple.

2289
02:38:17,610 --> 02:38:21,170
I knew where he was going the moment you said that.

2290
02:38:22,490 --> 02:38:23,770
It's simple.

2291
02:38:23,950 --> 02:38:24,310
No.

2292
02:38:28,610 --> 02:38:33,750
We're the most oppressed group in Marvel rivals.

2293
02:38:37,730 --> 02:38:41,830
I feel like support players get flamed the most, no matter
what.

2294
02:38:43,010 --> 02:38:48,810
Because it's like when the DPS fucks up their alt, they
don't, I mean they do, yeah, but like, I feel like DPS and

2295
02:38:48,810 --> 02:38:53,710
tanks, when they fuck up their alt, they don't get yelled as
much as when a support fucks up their alt.

2296
02:39:00,570 --> 02:39:01,330
More like...

2297
02:39:02,510 --> 02:39:03,470
Is that a 2-2?

2298
02:39:03,630 --> 02:39:03,870
Yeah.

2299
02:39:04,470 --> 02:39:05,750
It's here to give us a party.

2300
02:39:10,130 --> 02:39:11,390
But, but, uh...

2301
02:39:11,390 --> 02:39:13,390
But, but, but, uh...

2302
02:39:13,390 --> 02:39:15,230
I think that's why I haven't been playing a lot of rivals.

2303
02:39:17,450 --> 02:39:17,830
Um...

2304
02:39:17,830 --> 02:39:19,780
Also because I didn't get nominated, too, but, like...

2305
02:39:21,850 --> 02:39:22,610
There's no...

2306
02:39:22,610 --> 02:39:24,530
I mean, there might be correlation.

2307
02:39:26,950 --> 02:39:36,390
correlation why I haven't been streaming rivals too or like
playing it as much um um but like I just feel like the

2308
02:39:36,390 --> 02:39:44,690
players are much more toxic now than before like the other
seasons the other seasons like it's funny toxic but now it's

2309
02:39:44,690 --> 02:39:49,730
not funny no more now now it's just me

2310
02:39:56,950 --> 02:40:00,510
goba toxic but like they're allowed to talk to me like

2311
02:40:05,810 --> 02:40:11,630
they took out the funny yeah they took out the funny part of
the of being mean

2312
02:40:15,550 --> 02:40:24,070
hmm why is venom shaking it because we're q dodging have
they okay nice they're all out oh my god no they're not

2313
02:40:24,070 --> 02:40:32,450
they're not all out okay but like it's the storm oh my god
Wait, did I avoid the, I don't remember.

2314
02:40:32,570 --> 02:40:33,890
Did I avoid the storm?

2315
02:40:34,290 --> 02:40:35,030
I didn't, right?

2316
02:40:35,310 --> 02:40:37,530
Oh my god, they appear offline, aren't they?

2317
02:40:39,750 --> 02:40:41,370
Oh my god, this fucker.

2318
02:40:41,790 --> 02:40:44,470
This fucker is appear offline like a bitch.

2319
02:40:45,130 --> 02:40:46,950
Oh my god, third.

2320
02:40:48,030 --> 02:40:52,410
No, so he's like, no one can Q dodge me if I appear offline.

2321
02:40:52,870 --> 02:40:54,230
That fucking whore.

2322
02:40:56,090 --> 02:40:57,390
He's a pussy.

2323
02:40:57,970 --> 02:40:59,450
He doesn't even let me have the power.

2324
02:40:59,470 --> 02:41:03,230
privilege to cue dodge what a fucking pussy

2325
02:41:08,530 --> 02:41:10,790
that's fucked up that is so fucked up

2326
02:41:18,330 --> 02:41:24,270
he's a real that's like a professional agent he knows like
how many people avoid him because he's a storm like he knows

2327
02:41:24,270 --> 02:41:31,290
having people dodge him because he's a storm one trick the
point where he actually he's he's fucking the point where

2328
02:41:31,290 --> 02:41:33,810
where he's actually appearing offline.

2329
02:41:34,330 --> 02:41:35,930
That's full terrorism right there.

2330
02:41:37,090 --> 02:41:39,390
He doesn't even give us the privilege to Q-Dodge him.

2331
02:41:39,490 --> 02:41:43,570
He's like, you gotta find out yourself if I'll be in your
lobby or not.

2332
02:41:44,270 --> 02:41:47,770
Like, that's full-on terrorism right there.

2333
02:41:48,250 --> 02:41:53,790
Like, at least, like, you know, you know, you could at least
not appear offline.

2334
02:41:57,310 --> 02:41:58,970
Hiding like a landmine.

2335
02:41:59,130 --> 02:41:59,410
Yeah.

2336
02:41:59,710 --> 02:42:01,130

Okay, at least Mr. Fantastic didn't win.

2374
02:45:35,890 --> 02:45:38,210
Pick your hero or villain.

2375
02:45:38,530 --> 02:45:39,110
I'm not judging.

2376
02:45:39,330 --> 02:45:40,330
I have Burger Billy.

2377
02:45:41,210 --> 02:45:41,950
Like, I don't know.

2378
02:45:42,010 --> 02:45:44,090
I'm not feeling much hope with Burger Billy.

2379
02:45:46,250 --> 02:45:50,810
For some reason, I'm not feeling much excitement over Burger
Billy.

2380
02:45:51,110 --> 02:45:53,990
Hey guys, just so you know, I'm team leader, so I'm just put
that out there.

2381
02:45:55,090 --> 02:45:56,090
I call dibs.

2382
02:46:00,120 --> 02:46:01,440
That'd be the co-captain or something.

2383
02:46:01,460 --> 02:46:02,680
Make a way for the king of thieves.

2384
02:46:02,940 --> 02:46:03,400
Uh, how much?

2385
02:46:03,580 --> 02:46:05,620
What's wrong with Burger Billy?

2386
02:46:05,840 --> 02:46:06,940
That 275k.

2387
02:46:08,560 --> 02:46:09,660
That's, we can make more of that.

2388
02:46:09,740 --> 02:46:11,520
Burger Billy, my goat.

2389
02:46:11,640 --> 02:46:12,380
That's why you're the captain.

2390
02:46:12,580 --> 02:46:14,220
I'm co-captain.

2391
02:46:14,520 --> 02:46:14,760
True.

2392
02:46:17,020 --> 02:46:19,180
The shader isn't loading yet.

2393
02:46:21,140 --> 02:46:22,660
30 seconds before you attack.

2394
02:46:22,980 --> 02:46:23,500
Get ready.

2395
02:46:24,520 --> 02:46:25,660
Why are my shaders not loading?

2396
02:46:25,800 --> 02:46:26,460
All right, here you go.

2397
02:46:27,620 --> 02:46:28,060

2405
02:46:38,640 --> 02:46:39,000

I should not.

2412
02:46:51,540 --> 02:46:53,520

02:54:45,920 --> 02:54:47,920
Good shit, brother.

2544
02:54:48,520 --> 02:54:51,040
I like how the only people laughing are the people you're
playing with.

2545
02:54:52,320 --> 02:54:53,700
I'm never gonna die alive.

2546
02:54:54,180 --> 02:54:55,520
Yeah, my buddy, I'm still with you.

2547
02:54:56,520 --> 02:54:57,160
It's all right.

2548
02:55:08,040 --> 02:55:09,240
We did.

2549
02:55:11,040 --> 02:55:11,260
Yeah.

2550
02:55:11,260 --> 02:55:13,500
I just get 3ds Harley Kirk's on my team.

2551
02:55:17,100 --> 02:55:19,600
Maybe I wish you were Charlie Kirk.

2552
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:23,060
Oh my god.

2553
02:55:23,220 --> 02:55:23,660
Yeah.

2554
02:55:23,660 --> 02:55:24,700
Russians, honey.

2555
02:55:25,240 --> 02:55:26,120
Please!

2556
02:55:28,040 --> 02:55:29,840
Please come back again!

2557
02:55:32,840 --> 02:55:34,220
Right here.

2558
02:55:36,460 --> 02:55:43,800
Baby, your president sucks car.

2559
02:55:48,340 --> 02:55:51,460
Oh my god, please tell me I'm safe.

2560
02:55:52,740 --> 02:55:53,400
Am I safe?

2561
02:55:53,400 --> 02:55:53,580
Am I safe?

2562
02:55:53,660 --> 02:55:54,400
I'm so bad.

2563
02:55:54,600 --> 02:55:56,520
Oh my god, he relocated again.

2564
02:55:56,860 --> 02:55:57,660
No trolls.

2565
02:56:00,040 --> 02:56:03,480
Wait, guys, okay, you guys didn't hear...

2566
02:56:05,740 --> 02:56:06,300
Okay.

2567
02:56:09,360 --> 02:56:14,380
Okay, like, you guys didn't hear the invasals either, right?

2568
02:56:14,940 --> 02:56:17,760
Like, I'm not going crazy, right?

2569
02:56:21,000 --> 02:56:23,640
Wait, I don't know if I started playing better once the game
is done.

2570
02:56:23,660 --> 02:56:44,520
stop speaking a little bit i've been speaking the entire
fucking round i don't think they realize i'm streaming i

2571
02:56:44,520 --> 02:56:54,920
don't think they realize i am the streamer in the sloppy
right now i because i feel like if they know who i was who

2572
02:56:54,920 --> 02:57:01,940
is Currently, like, on the front, on the top of the rack, I
don't think they would say all of this stuff.

2573
02:57:02,460 --> 02:57:06,580
I don't think they have, oh, oh my gosh.

2574
02:57:07,420 --> 02:57:08,920
Maybe no one cares.

2575
02:57:09,300 --> 02:57:10,140
Overwatch is dead.

2576
02:57:12,020 --> 02:57:12,780
This is insane.

2577
02:57:14,460 --> 02:57:17,900
I'm a grown-ass man talking about peaks in a video game.

2578
02:57:18,180 --> 02:57:18,640
Go to work.

2579
02:57:18,720 --> 02:57:20,420
You're the one, you're the one, Keith.

2580
02:57:21,380 --> 02:57:25,120
Guys, I told you, I saw Burger Billy, and I knew this team.

2581
02:57:25,320 --> 02:57:28,380
I knew it was going to be one of those games.

2582
02:57:28,980 --> 02:57:29,960
I knew it.

2583
02:57:29,960 --> 02:57:32,020
It's not like the individual Burger Billy.

2584
02:57:32,300 --> 02:57:36,020
It's more so, like, the vibe of the team I was going to get.

2585
02:57:36,180 --> 02:57:38,300
You guys were like, what's wrong with Burger Billy?

2586
02:57:38,700 --> 02:57:41,600
And I was like, no, guys, I had the vibe.

2587
02:57:42,180 --> 02:57:43,680
Like, I had the vibe.

2588
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:49,100
I saw Burger Billy, and I was like, bro, I...

2589
02:57:49,100 --> 02:57:51,280
Wait, why didn't he bring it to the peak again?

2590
02:57:52,200 --> 02:57:53,820
Didn't go enough, man, by the way.

2591
02:57:55,320 --> 02:57:56,160
You're a little boy.

2592
02:57:56,660 --> 02:57:58,480
Oh, my God.

2593
02:57:58,520 --> 02:57:58,920
Oh.

2594
02:57:59,160 --> 02:58:00,740
That's how your dad's into those, though.

2595
02:58:02,440 --> 02:58:03,320
Wait, this game pedal?

2596
02:58:03,980 --> 02:58:04,880
Yeah, you gotta be.

2597
02:58:06,160 --> 02:58:06,600
Oh.

2598
02:58:10,680 --> 02:58:13,100
Oh, at least we contested a little bit, right?

2599
02:58:14,760 --> 02:58:16,080
I didn't think...

2600
02:58:17,760 --> 02:58:18,680
Oh, my God.

2601
02:58:18,840 --> 02:58:19,620
No, we weren't living.

2602
02:58:19,800 --> 02:58:20,180
It's okay.

2603
02:58:20,240 --> 02:58:21,080
We got the Scythe.

2604
02:58:21,400 --> 02:58:21,760
It's okay.

2605
02:58:21,820 --> 02:58:24,840
We got the Scythe and the Iron Fist.

2606
02:58:25,320 --> 02:58:26,440
Oh, God.

2607
02:58:27,360 --> 02:58:29,240
Guys, we did it.

2608
02:58:32,680 --> 02:58:34,120
Maybe Val don't know you.

2609
02:58:35,000 --> 02:58:37,220
Okay, okay, okay.

2610
02:58:38,500 --> 02:58:40,400
Okay, okay, okay.

2611
02:58:40,760 --> 02:58:42,400
Do your real voice, do your real voice.

2612
02:58:42,460 --> 02:58:43,460
I'll don't know you, sir.

2613
02:58:44,440 --> 02:58:45,060
Okay.

2614
02:58:45,060 --> 02:58:47,400
I know so.

2615
02:58:50,360 --> 02:58:51,060
Maybe?

2616
02:58:53,040 --> 02:58:53,620
Maybe?

2617
02:58:54,160 --> 02:58:54,760
Goodbye.

2618
02:58:57,580 --> 02:58:58,820
Yeah, I got you.

2619
02:59:01,720 --> 02:59:02,700
Oh my god.

2620
02:59:02,840 --> 02:59:03,760
I mean, I'm not opening that.

2621
02:59:04,380 --> 02:59:04,940
Why?

2622
02:59:05,600 --> 02:59:05,600
Why?

2623
02:59:05,940 --> 02:59:06,380
Why?

2624
02:59:06,520 --> 02:59:08,180
Why won't you alt this?

2625
02:59:08,640 --> 02:59:09,140
Why?

2626
02:59:10,140 --> 02:59:10,220
Why?

2627
02:59:10,420 --> 02:59:10,740
Why?

2628
02:59:12,120 --> 02:59:14,980
Why didn't you alt this?

2629
02:59:15,100 --> 02:59:16,760
What did I do to you?

2630
02:59:17,000 --> 02:59:19,020
We're all together the entire time.

2631
02:59:19,560 --> 02:59:21,000
What did I do to you?

2632
02:59:21,320 --> 02:59:22,520
You have to come out of your IP.

2633
02:59:22,820 --> 02:59:23,360
You can't see it.

2634
02:59:25,320 --> 02:59:27,320
Why did I shoot at you?

2635
02:59:31,620 --> 02:59:32,100
Never.

2636
02:59:33,400 --> 02:59:34,180
Oh my god!

2637
02:59:35,140 --> 02:59:35,820
I understood!

2638
02:59:36,860 --> 02:59:39,520
I didn't deserve this treatment!

2639
02:59:42,040 --> 02:59:46,160
Oh my- Don't get- Oh, we won.

2640
02:59:46,820 --> 02:59:47,240
It's fine.

2641

It's fine.

2642
02:59:53,300 --> 02:59:54,320
It's fine.

2643
02:59:56,820 --> 02:59:57,820
It's not fine.

2644
02:59:57,940 --> 02:59:58,820
It's no longer fine.

2645
02:59:58,960 --> 03:00:02,860
It's no longer fine It's no longer fine.

2646
03:00:03,220 --> 03:00:03,580

Okay, I'm spying.

2653
03:00:44,780 --> 03:00:47,860

2654
03:00:49,380 --> 03:00:51,780
What do you say fuck me for?

2655
03:00:57,760 --> 03:01:00,020
Guys, can you guys start being angry at each other again?

2656
03:01:00,100 --> 03:01:01,860
You guys perform better when you're angry at each other.

2657
03:01:02,380 --> 03:01:03,020
That's all I'm saying.

2658
03:01:04,140 --> 03:01:07,440
Like for some reason, you guys do better when you're all
angry at each other.

2659
03:01:07,740 --> 03:01:10,500
And like, please, please start yelling at each other again.

2660
03:01:11,000 --> 03:01:15,280
I really appreciate if you guys can yell at each other
again.

2661
03:01:15,540 --> 03:01:19,780
Because for some reason, you guys stop talking and now we
lose.

2662
03:01:20,800 --> 03:01:23,780
Guys, I need you guys to start talking again.

2663
03:01:26,880 --> 03:01:29,140

Oh, you're about A-O, bro.

2675
03:02:04,060 --> 03:02:05,080
You're actually better than A-O-O.

2676
03:02:06,420 --> 03:02:07,580
Oh, my God.

2677
03:02:07,760 --> 03:02:09,820
Well, you can't expect it from now.

2678
03:02:21,390 --> 03:02:21,930
Oh, my God.

2679
03:02:29,320 --> 03:02:30,620
Oh, my God.

2680
03:02:30,980 --> 03:02:31,260
Oh.

2681
03:02:39,720 --> 03:02:44,560
All right, I'm just gonna go with my gut that they all
avoided each other.

2682
03:02:48,940 --> 03:02:51,680
I'm just gonna assume.

2683
03:02:52,640 --> 03:02:54,780
Oh, hey, Burger Billy gave me a thumbs up.

2684
03:02:55,220 --> 03:02:59,820
I'm just gonna assume that they all avoided each other.

2685
03:03:01,500 --> 03:03:02,100
So...

2686
03:03:05,300 --> 03:03:07,200
I hope we all learned.

2687
03:03:07,700 --> 03:03:09,260
The thing is...

2688
03:03:09,500 --> 03:03:12,460
The thing is, for those who don't know,

2689
03:03:15,670 --> 03:03:21,110
when you're Celestial, you can't do more than duo.

2690
03:03:22,110 --> 03:03:24,770
So one of these guys is an actual solo player.

2691
03:03:24,950 --> 03:03:32,550
I can assume that maybe these three are trioed, and then
this guy is the solo.

2692
03:03:36,370 --> 03:03:39,910
But they all still ganged up on this guy.

2693
03:03:44,250 --> 03:04:01,710
guys i told you guys rivals now is is very funky now i told
you now rivals now is it's in a very weird state in rank

2694
03:04:08,670 --> 03:04:20,150
what did ariana grande do to deserve this the second movie
was pretty mediocre not gonna but um anyway so i think what

2695
03:04:20,150 --> 03:04:31,890
started it was ariana grande it was like criticizing our dps
for not doing anything because you know uh um because they

2696
03:04:31,890 --> 03:04:39,730
sort of weren't at first while like i was like doing so much
of healing and keeping my team alive and then i gambit

2697
03:04:39,730 --> 03:04:46,110
altered punishment and we still didn't kill anything and And
then so Ariana Grande was like, guys, come on.

2698
03:04:46,310 --> 03:04:53,610
And then, and then I think like Billy Burger or Burger Billy
was like, what's up with your fucking voice?

2699
03:04:54,250 --> 03:04:57,150
And then you're like, you sound annoying.

2700
03:04:57,690 --> 03:05:08,650
And then it all went downhill after that because he had a,
because Ariana Grande had a very flamboyant voice and, and

2701
03:05:08,650 --> 03:05:12,330
then gamer word, gamer slurs started coming out.

2702
03:05:12,910 --> 03:05:20,490
and then um and and then they started talking about their
rank peaks and then apparently they're like yeah i was rank

2703
03:05:20,490 --> 03:05:29,010
one in overwatch and then i'm like i i don't know if i can
believe him because if you're rank one in overwatch why the

2704
03:05:29,010 --> 03:05:39,750
are you here in gm i was like why was why is your account in
gm i don't know maybe it's an ult account i mean i could

2705
03:05:39,750 --> 03:05:44,250
check right now oh never mind Not right now.

2706
03:05:48,130 --> 03:05:50,230
I unfortunately could not check right now.

2707
03:05:52,050 --> 03:05:53,850
Which hero do you think you want to be today?

2708
03:05:54,070 --> 03:05:58,950
Yeah, it all started because Ariana Grande, because they did
not like Ariana Grande's.

2709
03:05:59,450 --> 03:06:04,630
And then, okay, but then like, and then Ariana Grande
started dragging me too.

2710
03:06:04,970 --> 03:06:08,590
And then if I was like, what the, I didn't even say anything
to you.

2711
03:06:08,910 --> 03:06:10,710
Like, why fuck me for?

2712
03:06:16,810 --> 03:06:20,150
I didn't even say anything to her

2713
03:06:31,640 --> 03:06:36,120
She was like She was criticizing like how I was playing

2714
03:06:39,590 --> 03:06:41,690
But I was like Bro what?

2715
03:06:42,470 --> 03:06:51,470
I saved your life so many times I was like I was like what
the fuck I saved your life

2716
03:06:59,050 --> 03:07:01,690
I told you, guys, I knew the vibe.

2717
03:07:03,230 --> 03:07:06,910
That moment I saw Burger Billy, I knew, you guys doubted me.

2718
03:07:06,970 --> 03:07:08,950
You're like, what the fuck is wrong with Burger Billy?

2719
03:07:09,110 --> 03:07:10,310
And I was like, no, you don't understand.

2720
03:07:10,750 --> 03:07:15,090
That's the name of someone that's the name of someone that's
going to start something.

2721
03:07:17,570 --> 03:07:18,790
I felt it.

2722
03:07:19,210 --> 03:07:20,810
I knew they were going to start something.

2723
03:07:21,290 --> 03:07:22,230
And I was right.

2724
03:07:33,150 --> 03:07:33,690
I was right.

2725
03:07:33,730 --> 03:07:36,830
I knew that team was going to explode.

2726
03:07:37,710 --> 03:07:45,490
like at character select I just didn't realize it was a
nuclear bomb

2727
03:07:50,600 --> 03:08:08,120
I was not ready for the bomb so go ahead and happy thank you

03:08:19,250 --> 03:08:21,030
It could be our Spider-Man.

2732
03:08:21,130 --> 03:08:24,930
This is a Spider-Man map, but it could always be the
Spider-Man.

2733
03:08:31,480 --> 03:08:32,600
Guys, uh...

03:09:27,780 --> 03:09:28,800
It's always a hit or miss.

2744
03:09:29,200 --> 03:09:31,160
It doesn't matter if it's a spider-man map.

2745
03:09:31,660 --> 03:09:32,900
It's always a hit or miss.

2746
03:09:35,800 --> 03:09:37,340
Okay, okay.

2747
03:09:44,490 --> 03:09:46,490

03:09:56,510 --> 03:09:58,250
I don't like that.

2751
03:10:01,710 --> 03:10:03,030
Alright, let's go.

03:11:34,070 --> 03:11:35,420
I got the card just in time.

2776
03:11:38,650 --> 03:11:40,290
I have to, like, be aware.

2777
03:11:40,610 --> 03:11:41,310
Be active.

Alright, so I have a feeling that the sidewalk is gonna try
and kill us all.

2792
03:12:09,810 --> 03:12:11,710
Just a little feeling.

2793
03:12:14,950 --> 03:12:16,670
Oh my god, alright.

2794
03:12:17,150 --> 03:12:18,890
Oh, goodbye, Spider-Man.

2795
03:12:21,670 --> 03:12:23,190
Um, who's pushing?

2796
03:12:23,310 --> 03:12:23,550
Okay.

2797
03:12:25,330 --> 03:12:27,850
Oh, no, oh, good luck, guys.

2798
03:12:28,330 --> 03:12:30,110
Oh my god.

2799
03:12:30,430 --> 03:12:33,410
Oh, they used everything.

2800
03:12:33,530 --> 03:12:33,910
That's fine.

2801
03:12:34,210 --> 03:12:34,670
That's fine.

2802
03:12:34,930 --> 03:12:35,110
That's fine.

2803
03:12:35,290 --> 03:12:36,230
That's fine by me.

2804
03:12:36,710 --> 03:12:38,790
That's like what they used?

2805
03:12:39,430 --> 03:12:42,950
Phoenix, Invis, and Gambit, and Scyloc.

2806
03:12:43,190 --> 03:12:44,190
That's, you know what?

2807
03:12:44,350 --> 03:12:45,510
I take those.

2808
03:12:47,470 --> 03:12:49,230
Like I knew that was in Winnebeth.

2809
03:12:50,190 --> 03:12:51,510
So like I'm fine with that.

2810
03:12:53,290 --> 03:12:54,810
Like I'm so fine with that.

2811
03:12:58,530 --> 03:12:59,720
All right, that's good.

2812
03:13:02,690 --> 03:13:09,930
Okay, I know our Spider-Man is trying to have an epic 1v1
with the Gambit, and he lost.

2813
03:13:12,970 --> 03:13:15,570
Okay, okay, I need you to heal.

2814
03:13:16,010 --> 03:13:18,650
Okay, there we go.

2815
03:13:19,670 --> 03:13:22,170
Okay, he's fucking stupid.

2816
03:13:22,290 --> 03:13:23,210
That's, thank God.

2817
03:13:24,410 --> 03:13:25,150
Thank God, okay.

03:13:30,330 --> 03:13:30,930
Okay, that's cool.

2821
03:13:34,310 --> 03:13:38,650
Alright, I had a feeling he had Scylocal and I was very
scared.

2822
03:13:40,050 --> 03:13:40,890
But that's okay.

2823
03:13:41,310 --> 03:13:42,030
We made it.

2824
03:13:44,350 --> 03:13:46,110
We fucking made it.

2825
03:13:47,490 --> 03:13:48,530
Oh, he blocked it?

2826
03:13:49,070 --> 03:13:49,730

03:13:52,430 --> 03:13:53,170
Okay, it's okay.

Oh, he's not Groot.

2836
03:14:43,700 --> 03:14:44,200
He's not Groot.

03:14:44,340 --> 03:14:45,240
Okay, I don't have to care.

2838
03:14:45,840 --> 03:14:46,440
Alright, it's fine.

2839
03:14:47,860 --> 03:14:48,740
I don't have to care.

2840
03:14:49,980 --> 03:14:51,300
Oh my god, I can't.

2841
03:14:52,120 --> 03:14:53,760
Oh my god, we couldn't feel him.

2842
03:14:57,360 --> 03:14:57,940
It's okay.

2843
03:14:58,060 --> 03:14:58,500
It's okay.

2844
03:14:58,800 --> 03:14:59,660
I can still reload.

2845
03:15:02,300 --> 03:15:02,920
There you go.

2846
03:15:03,080 --> 03:15:05,140
I didn't get him, but it was close enough.

2847
03:15:07,820 --> 03:15:08,980
Um, Spider-Man, good luck.

2848
03:15:10,500 --> 03:15:11,720
Good luck, Spider-Man.

2849
03:15:12,500 --> 03:15:13,400
Good luck.

2850
03:15:13,820 --> 03:15:14,960
I hope he lives.

2851
03:15:15,740 --> 03:15:17,900
I really hope our Spider-Man lives.

2852
03:15:19,380 --> 03:15:20,760
Okay, our Spider-Man's okay.

2853
03:15:21,160 --> 03:15:21,680
That's good.

2854
03:15:23,360 --> 03:15:25,300
What is going on up here?

2855
03:15:27,700 --> 03:15:28,060
Bro.

2856
03:15:29,520 --> 03:15:31,520
I swear to Spider-Man.

2857
03:15:31,940 --> 03:15:32,840
Spider-Man.

2858
03:15:33,080 --> 03:15:34,480
Like, are you okay?

2859
03:15:36,380 --> 03:15:37,660
I don't need to use this yet.

2860
03:15:40,160 --> 03:15:41,820
Okay, guys, you didn't see me miss that.

2861
03:15:42,080 --> 03:15:44,040
Okay, we don't need to use this yet.

2862
03:15:48,520 --> 03:15:51,780
You know what would have saved me there?

2863
03:15:52,040 --> 03:15:53,300
If I...

2864
03:15:53,300 --> 03:15:54,360
It's okay, it's okay.

2865
03:15:55,020 --> 03:15:55,600
It's okay.

2866
03:15:56,640 --> 03:15:57,320
It's okay.

2867
03:15:58,300 --> 03:15:58,960
It's okay.

2868
03:15:59,240 --> 03:15:59,540
It's okay.

2869
03:15:59,960 --> 03:16:00,280
It's okay.

2870
03:16:00,780 --> 03:16:01,920
It's so terrible.

2871
03:16:05,500 --> 03:16:06,560
It's all right.

2872
03:16:07,220 --> 03:16:07,820
It's okay.

2873
03:16:11,080 --> 03:16:12,680
Oh, it's no longer okay.

2874
03:16:13,280 --> 03:16:13,980
This is last fight.

2875
03:16:15,280 --> 03:16:16,360
Guys, we have to touch.

2876
03:16:18,540 --> 03:16:19,220
Don't worry.

2877
03:16:19,300 --> 03:16:20,120
Our group will touch.

2878
03:16:20,260 --> 03:16:21,140
Our group is heading there.

2879
03:16:21,360 --> 03:16:22,740
He's gonna be a hero.

2880
03:16:24,160 --> 03:16:24,780
He's a hero.

2881
03:16:25,140 --> 03:16:25,280
Shh.

2882
03:16:26,440 --> 03:16:27,740
He really is.

2883
03:16:29,000 --> 03:16:29,820
Oh, my God.

2884
03:16:29,900 --> 03:16:30,940
He actually is a hero.

2885
03:16:33,760 --> 03:16:35,260
Oh my god, where's my invis?

2886
03:16:35,640 --> 03:16:37,040
I don't know where she is.

2887
03:16:37,520 --> 03:16:38,620
And I'm so scared.

2888
03:16:39,860 --> 03:16:40,480
Oh my god.

2889
03:16:41,600 --> 03:16:41,620
Please.

2890
03:16:43,480 --> 03:16:43,780
Please.

2891
03:16:46,180 --> 03:16:46,320
Okay.

2892
03:16:47,660 --> 03:16:48,540
Guys, guys, guys.

2893
03:16:51,020 --> 03:16:52,320
Guys, someone has to touch.

2894
03:16:53,820 --> 03:16:54,240
No!

2895
03:16:56,220 --> 03:16:58,280
I was so close.

2896
03:17:00,000 --> 03:17:02,320
He will not see nine.

2897
03:17:03,080 --> 03:17:04,880
Famous last words

2898
03:17:07,940 --> 03:17:12,360
Famous last words he will not see night

2899
03:17:18,100 --> 03:17:23,240
Oh man, I hate to break it to you but something happened

2900
03:17:27,800 --> 03:17:32,180
Something fucking happened guys I hate to break it to you

2901
03:17:38,370 --> 03:17:40,630
I look, thank you for the videos, thank you, thank you.

2902
03:17:40,710 --> 03:17:42,870
How do I pull my girlfriend away from Gambit?

2903
03:17:43,090 --> 03:17:45,110
She already lowered Jesus Christ.

2904
03:17:45,590 --> 03:17:48,270
I'm sending an email to Gwongo and nerf him to the ground.

2905
03:17:49,410 --> 03:17:50,750
That's all you can do.

2906
03:17:51,510 --> 03:17:53,090
Send an email to Gwongo and then pray.

2907
03:17:53,870 --> 03:17:55,590
And he'll change Gambit.

2908
03:18:01,010 --> 03:18:03,050
I don't even know where I can play.

2909
03:18:03,230 --> 03:18:04,150
I don't even know where I can play.

2910
03:18:10,900 --> 03:18:11,300
Alright.

2911
03:18:12,620 --> 03:18:13,520
No, just nerf him.

2912
03:18:13,660 --> 03:18:13,920
I don't care.

2913
03:18:13,960 --> 03:18:14,460
I'm tired.

2914
03:18:14,480 --> 03:18:16,360
of how strong Gambit is.

2915
03:18:16,620 --> 03:18:16,940
Be fair.

2916
03:18:17,500 --> 03:18:18,280
That was fun to play.

2917
03:18:19,180 --> 03:18:20,500
But I'm already bored with the meta.

2918
03:18:25,360 --> 03:18:27,080
You know, we had too much of a good thing.

2919
03:18:28,080 --> 03:18:28,800
I'm greedy.

2920
03:18:28,920 --> 03:18:29,740
I'm already bored.

2921
03:18:30,540 --> 03:18:31,320
That's right.

2922
03:18:33,560 --> 03:18:35,000
Oh my god.

2923
03:18:35,880 --> 03:18:37,700
I don't like that to play so ahead.

2924
03:18:40,920 --> 03:18:42,120
I don't like that.

2925
03:18:45,280 --> 03:18:54,760
I don't like that I have to save this for heals because i'm
scared of my team i don't think my oh my god oh my god like

2926
03:18:54,760 --> 03:19:00,940
like i said like i said i have to just use this for heals
because my team is not okay right now

2927
03:19:05,460 --> 03:19:11,680
oh my god if i self heal then i won't i'll live at least

2928
03:19:16,620 --> 03:19:17,500
Are we stacked?

2929
03:19:17,860 --> 03:19:18,180
We are.

2930
03:19:18,400 --> 03:19:19,060
Okay, that's good.

2931
03:19:19,680 --> 03:19:20,780
That is good.

2932
03:19:21,880 --> 03:19:22,700
There we go.

2933
03:19:24,040 --> 03:19:24,580
Okay.

2934
03:19:25,740 --> 03:19:27,340
I don't want to be there.

2935
03:19:29,980 --> 03:19:31,840
We're still- it's still in them.

2936
03:19:32,060 --> 03:19:32,320
All right.

2937
03:19:33,040 --> 03:19:33,800
Let's go.

2938
03:19:37,180 --> 03:19:39,300
Okay, maybe I didn't have to use that.

2939
03:19:39,460 --> 03:19:40,500
I got scared.

2940
03:19:41,320 --> 03:19:42,080
Oh my god.

2941
03:19:42,360 --> 03:19:43,280
I- okay, that's good.

2942
03:19:43,920 --> 03:19:44,320
Nice.

2943
03:19:44,660 --> 03:19:46,300
We got the kills we need.

2944
03:19:46,620 --> 03:19:48,000
To secure it.

2945
03:19:48,040 --> 03:19:49,920
Look, I- I got scared.

2946
03:19:50,080 --> 03:19:51,740
Maybe I should have saved it.

2947
03:19:52,380 --> 03:19:52,940
Maybe.

2948
03:19:53,620 --> 03:19:54,760
But you don't understand.

2949
03:19:54,940 --> 03:19:56,340
I was very scared.

2950
03:19:57,460 --> 03:19:59,100
Okay, I gotta save this for it.

2951
03:19:59,320 --> 03:20:00,260
Oh my god.

2952
03:20:00,400 --> 03:20:01,020
Okay, that's fine.

2953
03:20:02,120 --> 03:20:04,860
I have to save this for a cleanse.

2954
03:20:05,860 --> 03:20:08,780
This looks like a fucking good old situation right now.

2955
03:20:09,340 --> 03:20:11,620
I'm gonna try and let our invis heal more.

2956
03:20:22,130 --> 03:20:22,890
That's good.

2957
03:20:26,110 --> 03:20:27,230
I don't have cleanse.

2958
03:20:27,590 --> 03:20:28,350
I don't have cleanse.

2959
03:20:28,970 --> 03:20:29,570
I don't have cleanse.

2960
03:20:30,730 --> 03:20:31,750
Oh my god.

2961
03:20:32,010 --> 03:20:32,670
I'm so sad.

2962
03:20:32,830 --> 03:20:33,490
I didn't have cleanse.

2963
03:20:33,930 --> 03:20:35,350
The one time I didn't have cleanse.

2964
03:20:37,250 --> 03:20:41,370
The one time.

2965
03:20:43,610 --> 03:20:46,310
The one time I didn't have cleanse.

2966
03:20:47,610 --> 03:20:49,590
Let me touch.

2967
03:20:50,470 --> 03:20:51,710
I don't know.

2968
03:20:51,910 --> 03:20:52,570
We can't touch.

2969
03:20:53,530 --> 03:20:54,270
There's no way.

2970
03:20:55,150 --> 03:20:55,830
Oh, hey, nice.

2971
03:20:56,010 --> 03:20:57,530
At least, I guess?

2972
03:21:00,450 --> 03:21:01,210
Okay.

2973
03:21:06,310 --> 03:21:07,070
Bro.

2974
03:21:08,130 --> 03:21:09,430
Holy shit.

2975
03:21:11,730 --> 03:21:12,490
Okay.

2976
03:21:12,890 --> 03:21:14,870
Oh, I'm sorry, bro.

2977
03:21:15,450 --> 03:21:17,730
I tried my best.

2978
03:21:20,590 --> 03:21:21,950
Oh my god, okay.

2979
03:21:22,650 --> 03:21:23,890
Okay, we're gonna go in.

2980
03:21:23,970 --> 03:21:25,170
I don't care about my bucky.

2981
03:21:25,270 --> 03:21:26,310
We're gonna go in.

2982
03:21:29,910 --> 03:21:30,310
Like.

2983
03:21:31,770 --> 03:21:32,490
Fuck this.

2984
03:21:33,030 --> 03:21:33,430
Let's go.

2985
03:21:35,510 --> 03:21:36,590
See, alright, that's fine.

2986
03:21:36,730 --> 03:21:38,350
We got the Invis out from...

2987
03:21:38,350 --> 03:21:38,870
That's fine.

2988
03:21:42,070 --> 03:21:44,550
Okay, I don't know about the Spider-Man out, but that's
fine.

2989
03:21:45,130 --> 03:21:46,410
We got the Invis all out.

2990
03:21:47,550 --> 03:21:48,430
Oh, nice.

2991
03:21:49,570 --> 03:21:50,090
Nice.

2992
03:21:51,510 --> 03:21:52,050
Look at that.

2993
03:21:54,390 --> 03:21:54,830
See?

2994
03:21:55,090 --> 03:21:55,230
See?

2995
03:21:55,390 --> 03:21:56,090
Look at.

2996
03:21:56,110 --> 03:21:57,230
Look at that, guys.

2997
03:21:57,870 --> 03:21:58,810
Look at that.

2998
03:21:59,690 --> 03:22:01,070
That was a good trade.

2999
03:22:01,670 --> 03:22:02,090
Good trade.

3000
03:22:02,350 --> 03:22:02,810
Good trade.

3001
03:22:05,730 --> 03:22:08,110
That's the trade I'm willing to take, guys.

3002
03:22:11,370 --> 03:22:12,430
Yeah, I'm just...

3003
03:22:14,410 --> 03:22:15,250
Oh, that's unlucky.

3004
03:22:16,150 --> 03:22:17,610
I saved my thing now.

3005
03:22:18,430 --> 03:22:20,050
Okay, I gotta save the cleanse.

3006
03:22:20,830 --> 03:22:22,070
I feel it.

3007
03:22:25,430 --> 03:22:29,070
Okay, I'm just making sure that we can all...

3008
03:22:29,070 --> 03:22:30,270
Oh, nope, no more cleanse.

3009
03:22:31,150 --> 03:22:31,690
Okay.

3010
03:22:32,750 --> 03:22:33,390
Okay.

3011
03:22:34,270 --> 03:22:37,870
Okay, nice.

3012
03:22:38,250 --> 03:22:40,710
I couldn't cleanse that.

3013
03:22:40,870 --> 03:22:43,990
There was no way I could cleanse that.

3014
03:22:46,730 --> 03:22:48,410
Um, I think it's...

3015
03:22:48,430 --> 03:23:04,270
a spotty issue guys i told you guys guys i did say you're
like who's the e-o-m-m agent guys i i told you it can only

3016
03:23:04,270 --> 03:23:15,070
it's always this it's always a spider bat even if it's a
good map it's always spider bat

3017
03:23:19,990 --> 03:23:20,470
use this.

3018
03:23:20,910 --> 03:23:22,150
Fuck yeah, I have to use it to you.

3019
03:23:26,770 --> 03:23:27,210
Alright.

3020
03:23:30,430 --> 03:23:31,150
There you go.

3021
03:23:31,630 --> 03:23:36,710
That was a lot of up though, which I did not like because we
did not trade anything for it.

3022
03:23:36,810 --> 03:23:37,490
Oh wait.

3023
03:23:38,050 --> 03:23:39,450
Except for Invisal.

3024
03:23:40,950 --> 03:23:42,350
Guys, I don't think we're winning this.

3025
03:23:43,470 --> 03:23:47,870
I think our team is better technically, but we're 5v6 right
now.

3026
03:23:49,250 --> 03:23:53,710
It is technically better, but it is still a 5v6.

3027
03:23:56,450 --> 03:23:58,450
What the fuck was he fighting?

3028
03:24:04,290 --> 03:24:05,590
Okay, I tried.

3029
03:24:06,330 --> 03:24:09,170
I really did try.

3030
03:24:09,770 --> 03:24:12,550
Oh my god, that was an explosion.

3031
03:24:23,170 --> 03:24:28,230
Guys, I think we're losing because of our Spider-Man.

3032
03:24:29,250 --> 03:24:30,710

Wait.

Okay, but there is hope.

There is hope.

3058
03:26:12,720 --> 03:26:13,100
There is hope.

3059
03:26:13,280 --> 03:26:14,080
There is hope.

3060
03:26:14,080 --> 03:26:14,820
There is hope.

3061
03:26:14,980 --> 03:26:20,110
Second, second, second, second, second, second, second,

So you know what that means.

3086

03:29:47,200 --> 03:29:53,120

Celestial 1 and I'm Celestial 3.

3092
03:29:53,440 --> 03:29:56,060
So he'll lose more and I gain more.

3093
03:30:02,210 --> 03:30:03,950
That's my favorite part.

3094
03:30:09,050 --> 03:30:09,490

3128
03:33:33,410 --> 03:33:38,150

did it, like, Avengers-style.

3129
03:33:38,510 --> 03:33:39,950
It's, like, everybody was there.

3130
03:33:40,310 --> 03:33:41,590
Literally, everyone was there.

3131
03:33:42,950 --> 03:33:45,590

I don't fucking even know.

3136
03:34:00,610 --> 03:34:03,050
And then it was, like, 6-7.

3137
03:34:04,990 --> 03:34:06,590
Chapter 6 to 7?

3138
03:34:06,810 --> 03:34:08,570
I was like, oh my god.

3139
03:34:08,750 --> 03:34:10,570
I believe they did that.

3140
03:34:10,710 --> 03:34:11,670
They actually made it.

3141
03:34:11,910 --> 03:34:13,730
They made a 6-7 jump.

3142
03:34:16,470 --> 03:34:16,950
Stop!

3143
03:34:19,850 --> 03:34:22,270
Because it was chapter 6 to 7.

3144
03:34:23,950 --> 03:34:24,890
Oh, they killed the button.

3145
03:34:24,930 --> 03:34:26,190
Who the fuck is going to report?

3146
03:34:26,390 --> 03:34:28,830
Are we not going to be transported by buses now?

3147
03:34:29,830 --> 03:34:31,310
Who will we think now?

3148
03:34:32,890 --> 03:34:34,790
Also, apparently, what's his name?

03:34:34,990 --> 03:34:42,330

03:35:06,830 --> 03:35:07,710
Oh, my god.

3158
03:35:08,210 --> 03:35:12,490
Oh, my... Sorry, I was... Sorry, I'm too busy gossiping.

3159
03:35:15,810 --> 03:35:16,910
My bad.

3160
03:35:17,450 --> 03:35:19,210
I was gossiping.

3161
03:35:21,910 --> 03:35:23,430
Oh, my god.

3162
03:35:23,610 --> 03:35:26,010
Oh, my god.

3163
03:35:28,590 --> 03:35:29,990
I'm trying my best.

3164
03:35:32,690 --> 03:35:33,990
We can kill him, right?

3165
03:35:35,390 --> 03:35:36,690
We can kill him, right?

3166
03:35:38,490 --> 03:35:40,250
But not one behind us.

3167
03:35:41,350 --> 03:35:44,070
Oh, my...

3168
03:35:44,070 --> 03:35:45,230
We did, we did, we did.

3169
03:35:45,350 --> 03:35:46,410
I spammed it.

3170
03:35:46,810 --> 03:35:48,230
I need you to know, I have...

3171
03:35:48,230 --> 03:35:50,350
I indeed spammed...

3172
03:35:50,350 --> 03:35:52,350
Guys, I don't know if this is winnable.

3173
03:35:54,410 --> 03:35:55,130
Oh, my God.

3174
03:35:55,190 --> 03:35:56,610
How did I miss that?

3175
03:35:56,950 --> 03:35:59,270
It went through his goddamn nigs!

3176
03:36:00,250 --> 03:36:00,650
It's okay.

3177
03:36:00,710 --> 03:36:02,690
I have it up soon.

3178
03:36:04,050 --> 03:36:04,750
It's okay.

3179
03:36:05,030 --> 03:36:05,510
Right here.

3180
03:36:06,130 --> 03:36:06,550
Right here.

3181
03:36:06,730 --> 03:36:08,250
The moment we're all...

3182
03:36:10,170 --> 03:36:11,110
Are we all here?

3183
03:36:12,450 --> 03:36:14,410
Oh my god, we better be here.

3184
03:36:15,670 --> 03:36:16,290
Alright, there you go.

3185
03:36:18,990 --> 03:36:19,510
Okay.

3186
03:36:20,050 --> 03:36:20,630
It's okay.

3187
03:36:20,870 --> 03:36:22,350
I died for the cause.

3188
03:36:24,750 --> 03:36:26,630
We still won the fight, guys.

3189
03:36:26,730 --> 03:36:28,550
I died for the cause.

3190
03:36:28,950 --> 03:36:30,230
Not our Emma though.

3191
03:36:30,250 --> 03:36:31,170
Our Emma might be dead.

3192
03:36:31,350 --> 03:36:32,250
Our Emma's definitely dead.

3193
03:36:32,450 --> 03:36:33,450
Our Emma's not living that.

3194
03:36:33,830 --> 03:36:34,630
No, 100%.

3195
03:36:34,630 --> 03:36:37,630
Our Emma is absolutely fucking dying to that.

3196
03:36:40,670 --> 03:36:42,070
Alright, it's fine.

3197
03:36:42,670 --> 03:36:43,270
Brigsy.

3198
03:36:44,010 --> 03:36:44,450
Hello.

3199
03:36:46,510 --> 03:36:47,590
Hello there.

3200
03:36:48,670 --> 03:36:49,030
Okay.

3201
03:36:50,010 --> 03:36:52,110
We got this together, Loki.

3202
03:36:53,650 --> 03:36:55,210
Loki, we got this together.

3203
03:36:58,270 --> 03:36:58,870
Alright.

3204
03:37:01,590 --> 03:37:02,550
Alright, that's...

3205
03:37:02,550 --> 03:37:04,410
I think I cleared everything for us.

3206
03:37:06,710 --> 03:37:07,670
I think...

3207
03:37:07,670 --> 03:37:10,050
See, look, look, everything is fine.

3208
03:37:12,050 --> 03:37:13,510
Alright, here we go.

3209
03:37:14,810 --> 03:37:15,270
Where are you?

3210
03:37:17,850 --> 03:37:18,810
What the...

3211
03:37:18,810 --> 03:37:19,870
Where are you, Rixie?

3212
03:37:20,090 --> 03:37:20,110
Oh.

3213
03:37:21,990 --> 03:37:23,730
Where are you at?

3214
03:37:24,390 --> 03:37:26,010
Where you at?

3215
03:37:28,490 --> 03:37:30,030
There's no way to make it in time, right?

3216
03:37:30,250 --> 03:37:31,330
Yeah, there's no way.

3217
03:37:33,250 --> 03:37:34,450
That's gonna be very concerned.

3218
03:37:38,450 --> 03:37:39,310
Alright, it's okay.

3219
03:37:41,190 --> 03:37:43,950
It's not, but like, I like to cope sometimes.

3220
03:37:44,490 --> 03:37:46,610
And by sometimes, I'm...

3221
03:37:46,610 --> 03:37:48,670
It's nearly my entire...

3222
03:37:48,670 --> 03:37:51,090
Loki, I am trying my best.

3223
03:37:55,430 --> 03:37:55,830
Okay.

3224
03:37:57,610 --> 03:37:59,330
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

3225
03:38:02,950 --> 03:38:03,850
There you go.

3226
03:38:06,170 --> 03:38:06,610
Okay.

3227
03:38:07,110 --> 03:38:08,050
I'm not gonna pee.

3228
03:38:12,130 --> 03:38:12,570
Nice.

3229
03:38:12,730 --> 03:38:13,150
We did it.

3230
03:38:13,210 --> 03:38:13,610
Look at us.

3231
03:38:16,670 --> 03:38:17,010
Guys.

3232
03:38:17,270 --> 03:38:17,450
Peace.

3233
03:38:18,070 --> 03:38:18,450
Guys, please.

3234
03:38:18,730 --> 03:38:19,030
Thank you.

3235
03:38:19,830 --> 03:38:21,330
Guys, I'm not winning that 1v1.

3236
03:38:21,470 --> 03:38:21,730
I need help.

3237
03:38:21,850 --> 03:38:22,210
I need assistance.

3238
03:38:22,350 --> 03:38:22,870
I'm from the A.

3239
03:38:25,730 --> 03:38:27,690
I demand no honor.

3240
03:38:28,270 --> 03:38:29,870
Oh my god.

3241
03:38:32,270 --> 03:38:34,370
I do not want honor.

3242
03:38:36,970 --> 03:38:37,970
It's okay.

3243
03:38:38,850 --> 03:38:39,810
I don't need honor.

3244
03:38:41,190 --> 03:38:42,110
I just want to live.

3245
03:38:43,370 --> 03:38:45,350
I'm going to try and, like, make that art.

3246
03:38:48,450 --> 03:38:48,810
Okay.

3247
03:38:55,460 --> 03:38:58,080
I'm just trying to...

3248
03:39:00,410 --> 03:39:01,490
Aw.

3249
03:39:02,810 --> 03:39:03,850
That's unlucky.

3250
03:39:05,930 --> 03:39:06,650
Hey, guys.

3251
03:39:07,570 --> 03:39:08,470
How does he get?

3252
03:39:08,490 --> 03:39:10,150
Get me from there!

3253
03:39:10,790 --> 03:39:11,970
Okay, give me a sec.

3254
03:39:17,250 --> 03:39:18,350
Come on, guys.

3255
03:39:19,110 --> 03:39:20,770
You're going to win this fight, right?

3256
03:39:24,470 --> 03:39:25,070
Let's get, let's get.

3257
03:39:26,610 --> 03:39:27,290
Did he hit him?

3258
03:39:27,410 --> 03:39:27,730
Did he hit him?

3259
03:39:27,890 --> 03:39:28,330
Oh my god.

3260
03:39:28,570 --> 03:39:28,930
Oh my god.

3261
03:39:29,130 --> 03:39:29,710
Okay, hit him.

3262
03:39:29,990 --> 03:39:30,310
Hit him.

3263
03:39:31,570 --> 03:39:32,670
Okay, we're doing it.

3264
03:39:33,590 --> 03:39:34,370
We're doing it.

3265
03:39:34,410 --> 03:39:35,050
We're doing it.

3266
03:39:39,320 --> 03:39:40,160
Oh my god.

3267
03:39:40,200 --> 03:39:42,420
No, I thought I went out of the circle.

3268
03:39:42,760 --> 03:39:44,300
That's why I was like, where am I?

3269
03:39:45,180 --> 03:39:46,240
I thought it was outside.

3270
03:39:47,340 --> 03:39:48,620
A circle is a circle.

3271
03:39:48,900 --> 03:39:50,280
That is not a...

3272
03:39:50,280 --> 03:39:52,360
That should not be part of the circle.

3273
03:39:53,140 --> 03:39:53,900
Jesus Christ.

3274
03:39:54,180 --> 03:39:54,700
What?

3275
03:39:58,260 --> 03:39:59,080
Okay, there we go.

3276
03:39:59,460 --> 03:39:59,900
Arlo keys.

3277
03:40:00,940 --> 03:40:02,160
Okay, that's fine.

3278
03:40:05,560 --> 03:40:06,420
What the fuck?

3279
03:40:07,440 --> 03:40:09,700
I'm too scared to go back deep in.

3280
03:40:10,200 --> 03:40:11,060
Too scared.

3281
03:40:12,600 --> 03:40:14,660
I've seen what happened to me.

3282
03:40:19,720 --> 03:40:20,120
Okay.

3283
03:40:20,360 --> 03:40:21,820
Came all the way to Europe.

3284
03:40:23,060 --> 03:40:23,780
All right, here we go.

3285
03:40:24,820 --> 03:40:25,460
The circle.

3286
03:40:26,980 --> 03:40:28,360
Oh, I missed that.

3287
03:40:28,580 --> 03:40:30,320
I didn't want to weigh in these logs too.

3288
03:40:31,220 --> 03:40:31,780
All right, here we go.

3289
03:40:31,860 --> 03:40:32,180
It's fine.

3290
03:40:32,380 --> 03:40:32,600
It's fine.

3291
03:40:33,360 --> 03:40:36,180
Oh, he went back to...

3292
03:40:38,000 --> 03:40:39,740
Okay, I'm gonna use that.

3293
03:40:40,280 --> 03:40:41,880
Okay, I'm gonna stand in front now.

3294
03:40:44,080 --> 03:40:45,080
I'm here to help.

3295
03:40:55,800 --> 03:40:59,140
Okay, I'm just gonna say it.

3296
03:40:59,360 --> 03:41:00,340
This is cyberbullying.

3297
03:41:00,840 --> 03:41:04,400
This is cyberbullying right now.

3298
03:41:04,620 --> 03:41:06,940
This is every time.

3299
03:41:08,740 --> 03:41:10,720
Every fucking time.

3300
03:41:11,960 --> 03:41:13,900
I get solo alted.

3301
03:41:13,900 --> 03:41:16,120
There's a cyber bullying

3302
03:41:20,300 --> 03:41:32,020
Like why the thing is he's he thinks I'm the Loki Gambit
That's the worst part Because he's trying to kill the Gambit

3303
03:41:32,020 --> 03:41:41,520
off He's trying to kill the Gambit off But yet somehow He
always picks the wrong Gambit He always picks me

3304
03:41:47,040 --> 03:41:50,880
He's like, this has to be the low-key gambit that altered
just now.

3305
03:41:52,180 --> 03:41:54,160
But it's always me.

3306
03:41:59,600 --> 03:42:02,240
Because when you kill the gambit, the gambit all stops.

3307
03:42:02,440 --> 03:42:03,160
Like every supporter.

3308
03:42:03,680 --> 03:42:06,000
But somehow he always picks the wrong gambit.

3309
03:42:07,080 --> 03:42:09,300
And it happens to be me every time.

3310
03:42:12,500 --> 03:42:15,400
Oh, okay, I'm good.

3311
03:42:15,620 --> 03:42:16,000
I'm okay.

3312
03:42:16,860 --> 03:42:20,020
I'm defeating, but at what cost?

3313
03:42:20,660 --> 03:42:22,480
Why is it always me?

3314
03:42:24,600 --> 03:42:26,220
He lost the gambit.

3315
03:42:26,420 --> 03:42:30,100
He lost the 50-50 three fucking times!

3316
03:42:31,760 --> 03:42:33,020
I think I'm fucking leaving.

3317
03:42:33,260 --> 03:42:35,120
I got my fucking thing.

3318
03:42:41,330 --> 03:42:42,470
Jesus Christ.

3319
03:42:42,990 --> 03:42:50,430

3325
03:43:21,000 --> 03:43:22,180
I'm very scared.

3326
03:43:23,820 --> 03:43:24,260
Oh, my God.

3327
03:43:24,500 --> 03:43:25,040
Come on.

3328
03:43:28,340 --> 03:43:28,760

Me and the Gampit.

3333
03:43:38,520 --> 03:43:40,140
What the fuck?

3334
03:43:42,140 --> 03:43:43,980
What the fuck happened?

3335
03:43:45,380 --> 03:43:48,240
I literally looked away for one second.

3336
03:43:48,780 --> 03:43:50,080
And then my Loki died.

3337
03:43:52,400 --> 03:43:53,320
That's crazy.

3338
03:43:54,460 --> 03:43:55,860
My Loki died so fast.

3339
03:43:57,180 --> 03:43:57,800
Jesus Christ.

3340
03:43:58,060 --> 03:43:59,320
Guys, I don't like this game anymore.

3341
03:44:01,400 --> 03:44:03,360
There's too much damage, and I don't like that.

3455
03:53:07,690 --> 03:53:07,810
Agua.

3456
03:53:08,070 --> 03:53:08,450
I'm blocking those.

3457
03:53:08,790 --> 03:53:09,470
Oh, my.

3458
03:53:12,190 --> 03:53:12,910
Come on.

3459
03:53:14,070 --> 03:53:15,030
I don't have a weapon.

3460
03:53:15,810 --> 03:53:16,470
Are you serious?

3461
03:53:18,450 --> 03:53:20,150
I'm trying to kite as much as I can.

3462
03:53:21,050 --> 03:53:21,510
Oh, my.

3463
03:53:21,530 --> 03:53:22,030
Oh my god.

3464
03:53:25,570 --> 03:53:27,170
There's nothing I could do.

3465
03:53:29,230 --> 03:53:31,470
They've just built Gambit up so much faster.

3466
03:53:32,230 --> 03:53:32,230
Do

3467
03:53:37,630 --> 03:53:40,530
you just go with our Gambit?

3468
03:53:41,350 --> 03:53:42,130
Yeah, we're not going to.

3469
03:53:45,290 --> 03:53:45,670
Okay.

3470
03:53:47,390 --> 03:53:48,490
Come on, I'm on.

3471
03:53:49,670 --> 03:53:50,850
I'll go on my Gambit.

3472
03:53:53,110 --> 03:53:54,450
I swear to God.

3473
03:53:55,230 --> 03:53:56,570
I swear to God.

3474
03:53:59,250 --> 03:54:14,610
do it do it go go we're all it's everything everything just
everything oh my god time to switch things up including

3475
03:54:14,610 --> 03:54:23,650
which side you're on oh my god we had these every oh okay
the only concern was that we had a very rough time pushing

3476
03:54:23,650 --> 03:54:31,590
first point that is my concern we had a very rough time
pushing first point

3477
03:54:37,230 --> 03:54:46,230
it's never again it's never rocket time because because it's
always gambit time if we don't play gambit you lose

3478
03:54:50,330 --> 03:55:01,670
oh the worst part is that i can't dps because i know i have
to heal I swear to God, our tanks are sponges.

3479
03:55:01,850 --> 03:55:03,350
They're actual sponges.

3480
03:55:03,830 --> 03:55:04,690
Like, look at...

3481
03:55:04,690 --> 03:55:05,990
Look at...

3482
03:55:05,990 --> 03:55:06,730
Our tank...

3483
03:55:06,730 --> 03:55:08,710
One of our tanks is literally 14 deaths.

3484
03:55:09,450 --> 03:55:12,870
He's a fucking goddamn fucking damage sponge.

3485
03:55:14,590 --> 03:55:16,810
Like, I literally can't DPS.

3486
03:55:23,940 --> 03:55:25,160
Okay, we could...

3487
03:55:25,160 --> 03:55:30,520
You know, as I say, I could be extra sweaty and pull up
Rocket and give us armor and then come out as Gambit.

3488
03:55:30,520 --> 03:55:32,580
Three, two, one!

3489
03:55:38,510 --> 03:55:38,750
Jeez!

3490
03:55:39,910 --> 03:55:41,750

3493
03:55:50,290 --> 03:55:52,170

03:57:56,390 --> 03:58:02,040
Oh my god, triple support!

3519
03:58:06,680 --> 03:58:07,480
Triple support.

3520
03:58:07,620 --> 03:58:09,120
Okay, I'm gonna have to let our low-key heal.

3521
03:58:13,470 --> 03:58:14,170
Our low-key, I see you.

3522
03:58:14,350 --> 03:58:15,550
Just copy and go with Gambit.

3523
03:58:16,290 --> 03:58:17,550
You might need to like look for the atom.

3524
03:58:17,730 --> 03:58:18,190
He's probably hiding.

3525
03:58:18,470 --> 03:58:20,470
This automaton must complete its mission.

3526
03:58:20,470 --> 03:58:21,470
The final 10 seconds.

3527
03:58:24,130 --> 03:58:24,970
There you go.

3528
03:58:25,290 --> 03:58:41,030

Okay.

3534
03:59:02,490 --> 03:59:05,470

03:59:11,670 --> 03:59:12,850

Watch me out.

3539
03:59:16,470 --> 03:59:16,910
Turn below.

3540
03:59:18,890 --> 03:59:20,370
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on.

3541
03:59:20,870 --> 03:59:21,570
Oh my god.

3542
03:59:24,810 --> 03:59:26,390
Oh my god, I couldn't do anything.

3543
03:59:30,740 --> 03:59:32,660
Oh my god.

3544
03:59:35,940 --> 03:59:38,360
They had triple support.

3545
03:59:39,280 --> 03:59:40,840
What did we do with that?

3546
03:59:45,940 --> 03:59:47,100
Oh my god.

3547
03:59:47,260 --> 03:59:48,240
It's just triple support.

3548
03:59:49,800 --> 03:59:51,380
Triple support is just so broken.

3549
03:59:54,220 --> 03:59:55,900
I didn't even get a final blow.

3550
03:59:56,220 --> 03:59:57,820
I was getting harassed non-stop.

3551
04:00:02,610 --> 04:00:03,470
Oh, I hate that.

3552
04:00:03,830 --> 04:00:06,930
that they went triple like there's nothing we could do

3553
04:00:10,070 --> 04:00:19,450
i was just i just kept getting hard targeted and no one
stacked up in the side lock up no one stacked up in the side

3554
04:00:19,450 --> 04:00:31,850
lock up so i always died to it every time every time because
he would just solo all me every time no triple support is

3555
04:00:31,850 --> 04:00:44,290
always the strongest cop They went triple support and it
worked for them It just sucked Our Loki copied mag To During

3556
04:00:44,290 --> 04:00:54,310
that one fight that we needed him on Gambit Every time And
then the fucking Emma The Emma and Silo were chasing Me

3557
04:00:54,310 --> 04:00:56,350
everywhere during the Did you guys see that?

3558
04:00:56,670 --> 04:01:06,250
The Emma ran past The mag past the point To fight me off
point And was just chasing me everywhere Yeah, during the

3559
04:01:06,250 --> 04:01:07,090
last fight.

3560
04:01:09,590 --> 04:01:11,270
Like, I don't know where to position.

3561
04:01:11,750 --> 04:01:13,070
They were all just running at me.

3562
04:01:19,720 --> 04:01:21,000
That was crazy.

3563
04:01:24,460 --> 04:01:27,680
Yeah, and then my entire team, half the team was in the
front.

3564
04:01:28,340 --> 04:01:29,080
One on the cart.

3565
04:01:29,460 --> 04:01:31,000
Okay, no, majority of the team was in the front.

3566
04:01:31,300 --> 04:01:32,720
One in the cart, me at the back.

3567
04:01:33,260 --> 04:01:35,060
And then the Emma was like, she's alone.

3568
04:01:36,540 --> 04:01:39,260
She's like, you're mad cat, leave the car or she'll see
nine.

3569
04:01:47,460 --> 04:01:48,260

Yeah.

3602
04:03:45,390 --> 04:03:47,190
This brings me joy.

3603
04:03:52,230 --> 04:03:53,210
I have felt...

3604
04:03:53,210 --> 04:03:53,670
Oh, shit.

3605
04:03:53,950 --> 04:03:54,230
Oh, shit.

3606
04:03:54,410 --> 04:03:54,530
Keep joy.

04:03:56,330 --> 04:03:56,550
Yes!

3610
04:03:58,130 --> 04:03:59,630
Keep made a circle.

04:04:03,650 --> 04:04:03,890
Oh.

04:04:08,410 --> 04:04:10,930
I wish you can turn on friendly fire mode.

3614
04:04:11,770 --> 04:04:15,230
You should be allowed to turn on friendly fire mode too.

3615
04:04:17,050 --> 04:04:18,430
It's time square.

3616
04:04:20,290 --> 04:04:20,750
Boo!

And that, Jeff.

04:04:32,450 --> 04:04:34,370
He's ruining a good time.

3619
04:04:35,070 --> 04:04:36,790
Me and the other Venom were vibing.

You protect me.

That is the circle of life.

3656
04:08:16,050 --> 04:08:18,250
Do you believe in the circle of life?

3657
04:08:19,430 --> 04:08:22,170

04:09:30,270 --> 04:09:31,110
Why?

3672
04:09:32,530 --> 04:09:34,430

3684
04:10:47,860 --> 04:10:49,880
I didn't want to use that, but...

3685
04:10:51,820 --> 04:10:54,820
Yeah, we gotta walk here.

3686
04:10:56,080 --> 04:10:57,580

3687
04:10:57,940 --> 04:10:58,600

3688
04:10:59,100 --> 04:10:59,100
Oh,

3689
04:11:07,560 --> 04:11:08,880
are you fucking kidding me?

3690
04:11:12,860 --> 04:11:14,360
There's nothing I could do.

3691
04:11:14,900 --> 04:11:15,520
There's...

3692
04:11:19,220 --> 04:11:27,900
Our Luna took up all the heal so I couldn't I couldn't build
my all-in tab The current score is I literally was trying to

3693
04:11:27,900 --> 04:11:30,080
build my all and then

3694
04:11:34,200 --> 04:11:36,840
And then our Luna took all the heals

3695
04:11:41,960 --> 04:11:44,140
How is this so painful?

3696
04:11:45,100 --> 04:11:52,040
You see Rixie told me that he you is better for Q's I'm
starting to believe he lied to me.

3697
04:11:55,140 --> 04:11:57,260
I'm starting to really believe that.

3698
04:11:58,040 --> 04:12:00,060
I don't think EU was it in the end.

3699
04:12:10,000 --> 04:12:11,760
I'm pretty sure he lied to me.

3700
04:12:17,960 --> 04:12:22,440
It's like, also like, why did they all left me to die?

3701
04:12:23,180 --> 04:12:25,800
Like, I don't understand.

3702
04:12:25,820 --> 04:12:26,920
understand that.

3703
04:12:27,480 --> 04:12:29,480
Also, why did we aggressively Luna ult?

3704
04:12:29,560 --> 04:12:30,820
Who told her to do that?

3705
04:12:31,480 --> 04:12:33,220
Who told her to do that?

3706
04:12:34,080 --> 04:12:38,060
Yeah, and then when I aggressively support her, I get yelled
at!

3707
04:12:39,540 --> 04:12:41,220
I don't understand!

3708
04:12:41,960 --> 04:12:43,400
How come, like...

3709
04:12:43,400 --> 04:12:49,560
How come, like, they aggressively Luna ulted, support ulted,
and then...

3710
04:12:50,440 --> 04:12:51,720
And yet...

3711
04:12:51,720 --> 04:12:55,240
I get yelled at for doing the same thing.

3712
04:12:55,340 --> 04:12:55,800
Okay.

3713
04:12:59,400 --> 04:13:03,500

04:13:37,080 --> 04:13:39,440
That's crazy that you thought...

3718
04:13:40,260 --> 04:13:42,440
That that was salvageable.

3719
04:13:47,230 --> 04:13:48,050
Oh my god.

3720
04:13:56,910 --> 04:13:57,530
My god.

3721
04:13:59,390 --> 04:14:01,190
I... there's nothing I could do.

3722
04:14:01,510 --> 04:14:01,850
There's...

3723
04:14:02,910 --> 04:14:04,210

What do I do?

3726
04:14:08,610 --> 04:14:12,750
Me and the Luna, we were just pocketing each other 24-7.

3727
04:14:13,350 --> 04:14:14,910
Like, I don't know.

3728
04:14:16,470 --> 04:14:16,910
I...

3729
04:14:16,910 --> 04:14:17,810
Final score.

3730
04:14:18,270 --> 04:14:20,010
0-2-1.

3731
04:14:24,460 --> 04:14:26,080
At least they didn't yell at me.

3732
04:14:27,940 --> 04:14:28,380
Yay!

3733
04:14:31,220 --> 04:14:35,960
When you cleanse any movement, I don't think I had the cards
yet.

3734
04:14:36,040 --> 04:14:36,480
I don't know.

3735
04:14:37,040 --> 04:14:38,280
I don't think I had the cards.

3736
04:14:40,220 --> 04:14:42,940
Miser, thank you for the Twitch Prime, thank you, thank you.

3737
04:14:43,680 --> 04:14:45,240
I didn't get yelled at, guys.

3738
04:14:45,600 --> 04:14:46,480
That's a plus.

3739
04:14:48,880 --> 04:14:50,120
No one yelled at me?

3740
04:14:50,560 --> 04:14:50,920
Yeah.

3741
04:14:54,430 --> 04:14:56,170
I told you.

3742
04:14:56,730 --> 04:14:58,250
EU ain't it.

3743
04:15:00,390 --> 04:15:00,990
Cursed.

3744
04:15:03,670 --> 04:15:06,890
I think I've lost more on EU than I have in LA.

3745
04:15:11,330 --> 04:15:14,170
Uh, do they have time to get water?

3746
04:15:15,690 --> 04:15:16,430
I'm gonna get water.

3747
04:15:16,950 --> 04:15:17,730
I think I have time.

3748
04:15:18,070 --> 04:15:18,790
I'm gonna book it.

3749
04:15:18,890 --> 04:15:19,370
I'll be right back.

3750
04:15:33,410 --> 04:15:35,970
Guys, guys, now I forgot to give you guys a show.

3751
04:15:37,990 --> 04:15:39,430

Thank you, thank you.

3757
04:18:08,830 --> 04:18:10,630
Just join the stream and watch the Venom twerking.

3758
04:18:10,770 --> 04:18:12,830
Of course, I'll start following you.

3759
04:18:13,590 --> 04:18:14,470
But all else, fellas.

3760
04:18:15,210 --> 04:18:16,460
Venom will at least be there for me.

3761
04:18:17,590 --> 04:18:20,110
No matter what happens, he'll be there for me.

3762
04:18:26,690 --> 04:18:27,150
Oh.

3763
04:18:29,350 --> 04:18:30,770
I'm just relaxed now.

3764
04:18:34,490 --> 04:18:35,770
You know what's crazy?

3765
04:18:35,930 --> 04:18:38,670
For those who didn't know, they added the Funko Pop shop.

3766
04:18:38,830 --> 04:18:40,570
What the fuck is...

3767
04:18:40,570 --> 04:18:43,890
What the fuck is going on here?

3768
04:18:44,570 --> 04:18:47,370
Is this the meeting of fucking, oh my god.

3769
04:18:48,090 --> 04:18:50,830
It's a wedding with...

3770
04:18:55,940 --> 04:18:59,340
Is this the bachelor party I was invited?

3771
04:19:00,020 --> 04:19:02,440
Is this a bachelorette party?

3772
04:19:02,880 --> 04:19:05,140
Who ordered the entertainment?

3773
04:19:09,520 --> 04:19:12,100
It's the bachelorette party!

3774
04:19:12,120 --> 04:19:13,860

04:19:24,680 --> 04:19:28,200
Happy birthday, Mr. President.

3778
04:19:30,280 --> 04:19:31,760
Oh, don't worry.

3779
04:19:31,960 --> 04:19:35,160
The bride-to-be will get a special discount.

3780
04:19:37,680 --> 04:19:39,120

3785
04:19:50,440 --> 04:19:51,300
Why is he doing here?

3786
04:19:51,340 --> 04:19:52,200
He's just reading a book.

3787
04:19:52,340 --> 04:19:53,120
Who invited this guy?

3788
04:19:53,220 --> 04:19:55,360
I like how this person has not moved.

3789
04:19:55,480 --> 04:19:57,960
All the other, all the other girls moved away.

04:21:56,660 --> 04:21:59,680
The grass is always greener.

3805
04:21:59,820 --> 04:22:01,200
It really is.

3806
04:22:01,900 --> 04:22:05,820
It really is always greener on the other side.

3807
04:22:07,520 --> 04:22:08,060
Oh,

3808
04:22:11,450 --> 04:22:12,010

04:22:13,850 --> 04:22:14,650
That's funny.

3810
04:22:15,410 --> 04:22:15,890
Triple dive.

3811
04:22:16,730 --> 04:22:17,410

3812
04:22:17,670 --> 04:22:18,910
Oh, my God.

3813
04:22:19,590 --> 04:22:20,690
What is this?

3814
04:22:24,530 --> 04:22:26,250
The grass is never...

3815
04:22:26,250 --> 04:22:26,630
You're right.

3816
04:22:26,690 --> 04:22:27,830
All my grass is dead.

3817
04:22:29,190 --> 04:22:30,250
It's just dead.

3818
04:22:32,690 --> 04:22:34,030
We didn't ask to be heroes.

3819
04:22:34,550 --> 04:22:36,430
But we always finish the party set.

3820
04:22:36,470 --> 04:22:37,590
Do I go RFS or BP?

3821
04:22:37,790 --> 04:22:38,210
Get ready.

3822
04:22:38,450 --> 04:22:41,550
Fucking what the bro, I feel like iron fist.

3823
04:22:42,010 --> 04:22:42,930
Oh yeah, iron fist.

3824
04:22:43,230 --> 04:22:43,470
Yeah.

3825
04:22:43,550 --> 04:22:46,150
Like iron fist is better peels if needed.

3826
04:22:47,550 --> 04:22:48,150
No, they've...

3827
04:22:48,150 --> 04:22:49,230
Grass is like burnt.

3828
04:22:50,330 --> 04:22:50,950
Nothing is...

3829
04:22:50,950 --> 04:22:51,510
It's like...

3830
04:22:51,510 --> 04:22:56,090
You know, like when a nuclear bomb drops on a field and then
like grass never grows back there again?

3831
04:22:56,270 --> 04:22:57,830
That's what my grass looks like right now.

3832
04:23:00,090 --> 04:23:01,650
Maybe I should play on full screen.

3833
04:23:02,790 --> 04:23:03,090
Maybe?

3834
04:23:03,510 --> 04:23:03,950
Maybe.

3835
04:23:04,550 --> 04:23:04,990

3839
04:23:10,370 --> 04:23:20,430
Maybe that's all I need Full screen Maybe Maybe something

You know, I'll take...

3846
04:23:57,030 --> 04:23:59,150
Oh, I used up my pull.

3847
04:23:59,290 --> 04:24:01,030
Let's hope nobody gets grabbed.

3848
04:24:01,590 --> 04:24:02,650
No touchy, no touchy.

3849
04:24:02,770 --> 04:24:04,150
I don't have pull, no touchy.

3850
04:24:04,770 --> 04:24:05,870
Maybe they'll be nice.

3851
04:24:06,970 --> 04:24:08,150
No touchy, guys.

Ready on me, try on me.

3868
04:25:17,410 --> 04:25:19,370
Don't mess with the amazing city!

3869
04:25:19,930 --> 04:25:21,750
We have to live, we have to live.

3870
04:25:22,550 --> 04:25:24,310
Oh my god, I'm dead, goodbye.

3871
04:25:26,570 --> 04:25:27,050
Yay!

3872
04:25:28,490 --> 04:25:28,970
Yay!

3873
04:25:28,970 --> 04:25:29,630
You walked this hello.

3874
04:25:31,370 --> 04:25:31,730
Yay!

3875
04:25:35,730 --> 04:25:37,630
Oh, no longer, yeah.

3876
04:25:38,690 --> 04:25:40,670
No longer, yay.

3877
04:25:41,170 --> 04:25:44,910
I do not feel very yay.

3878
04:25:48,490 --> 04:25:49,550
We die.

3879
04:25:49,710 --> 04:25:50,590
One of us will die.

3880
04:25:53,190 --> 04:25:53,470
Let's watch.

3881
04:25:53,730 --> 04:25:55,410
Hey, let's go.

3882
04:25:59,830 --> 04:26:00,590
That's...

3883
04:26:01,570 --> 04:26:02,610
Let's go.

3884
04:26:05,770 --> 04:26:06,850
That's what...

3885
04:26:06,850 --> 04:26:07,910
You can tell why...

3886
04:26:07,910 --> 04:26:11,530
Okay, I knew I was going to be the one that they were going
to aim for.

3887
04:26:12,050 --> 04:26:13,350
That's why I didn't stand.

3888
04:26:13,490 --> 04:26:16,390
Do you guys notice how I didn't stand near my team?

3889
04:26:17,710 --> 04:26:18,510
That stood?

3890
04:26:18,950 --> 04:26:21,030
Because everyone else was super bunched up.

3891
04:26:21,130 --> 04:26:25,130
Did you notice how I actually, I stood away from my team?

3892
04:26:25,310 --> 04:26:27,970
Because I knew that it was going to be me.

3893
04:26:29,870 --> 04:26:31,670
I had a feeling.

3894
04:26:34,030 --> 04:26:35,530
Oh my god.

3895
04:26:36,030 --> 04:26:37,890
You think the Spider-Man is over?

3896
04:26:37,910 --> 04:26:47,830
right now like I took one I didn't have shield I already
used it when I was getting fucking touched by a spider-man

3897
04:26:47,830 --> 04:27:06,290
and Angela like I don't know if you guys saw that but but I
was not okay bro bro bro bro the fight is still bro there's

3898
04:27:06,290 --> 04:27:07,590
No, it's not what's...

3899
04:27:07,590 --> 04:27:08,330
Oh, oh.

3900
04:27:10,810 --> 04:27:11,990
He's like, yay.

3901
04:27:12,530 --> 04:27:13,410
Wait, did you see him?

3902
04:27:13,570 --> 04:27:16,650
He was spamming the fucking happy birthday.

3903
04:27:17,510 --> 04:27:18,270
Happy birthday.

3904
04:27:18,830 --> 04:27:23,650
Our fucking Emma kept spamming the happy birthday while the
guy, the mag just...

3905
04:27:23,650 --> 04:27:25,170
The mag was just touching her.

3906
04:27:31,630 --> 04:27:34,190
It feels good to step outside my bubble every now.

3907
04:27:34,190 --> 04:27:34,730
You know what?

3908
04:27:34,730 --> 04:27:35,730
See, it's not that bad.

3909
04:27:36,050 --> 04:27:36,730
Grass is...

3910
04:27:36,730 --> 04:27:38,350
See, it's not that bad, guys.

3911
04:27:39,510 --> 04:27:40,850
He's not that bad.

3912
04:27:43,070 --> 04:27:45,930
This map Mag can play the game a little bit, Spidey.

3913
04:27:46,010 --> 04:27:46,690
It's okay though.

3914
04:27:49,010 --> 04:27:50,810
I jinxed us, we're gonna lose now.

3915
04:27:51,010 --> 04:27:52,270
Because I was like, see you guys, not that bad.

3916
04:27:52,330 --> 04:27:53,050
Now we're gonna lose.

3917
04:27:53,190 --> 04:27:54,410
I jinxed us, I'm so fucked up.

3918
04:27:54,730 --> 04:27:55,650
Why did I say that?

3919
04:27:56,310 --> 04:27:56,710
Why?

3920
04:27:56,870 --> 04:27:57,890
I should have just been humble.

3921
04:27:58,670 --> 04:28:00,210
Why wasn't I just humble?

3922
04:28:06,190 --> 04:28:08,090
I just had to say something.

3923
04:28:08,450 --> 04:28:08,910
I did.

3924
04:28:09,670 --> 04:28:10,450

Yeah, we were.

3932
04:29:06,850 --> 04:29:10,250

Well...

3934
04:29:12,970 --> 04:29:14,650
If I didn't know that, we would have died.

3935
04:29:14,950 --> 04:29:16,550
But we still died it anyway.

3936
04:29:18,790 --> 04:29:20,030
Why do you remember it?

3937
04:29:20,950 --> 04:29:22,690
Hey guys, can we like...

3938
04:29:22,690 --> 04:29:24,250
Kill the spider?

3939
04:29:26,050 --> 04:29:27,610
Okay, no, he's dead.

3940
04:29:27,810 --> 04:29:31,490
Yeah, we ain't saving Spider-Man.

3941
04:29:32,370 --> 04:29:34,570
Guys, I jinxed it, guys.

3942
04:29:34,850 --> 04:29:36,010
I jinxed it.

3943
04:29:36,450 --> 04:29:39,210
I jinxed it, guys.

3944
04:29:39,750 --> 04:29:42,070
I jinxed it.

3945
04:29:42,390 --> 04:29:48,500
I'm sorry.

3946
04:29:49,220 --> 04:29:50,580

3947
04:29:52,900 --> 04:29:54,800

3948
04:29:56,800 --> 04:30:00,620
Team, I'm sorry.

3949
04:30:03,520 --> 04:30:04,660
There we go.

3950
04:30:05,860 --> 04:30:07,500
Okay, we definitely didn't need all of that.

3951
04:30:07,680 --> 04:30:08,440
Oh, but he still died.

3952
04:30:09,400 --> 04:30:10,300
Where's the thing?

3953
04:30:10,540 --> 04:30:12,780
Deja Vu, except reverse of what happened last.

3954
04:30:14,320 --> 04:30:14,800
Alright.

3955
04:30:17,000 --> 04:30:18,400
Yeah, this one's on me.

3956
04:30:18,800 --> 04:30:19,540
No, I agree.

3957
04:30:21,960 --> 04:30:23,400
He doesn't hurt a fool.

3958
04:30:25,220 --> 04:30:28,460
Oh my god, I almost I almost saved them, but I fucked up.

3959
04:30:28,460 --> 04:30:28,780
I think above.

3960
04:30:29,140 --> 04:30:29,740
Big more thing.

3961
04:30:29,920 --> 04:30:30,260
What are you doing?

3962
04:30:31,740 --> 04:30:33,060
That's a good question.

3963
04:30:33,360 --> 04:30:34,180
I'll pass you up.

3964
04:30:34,580 --> 04:30:38,520
I was a bit overrode.

3965
04:30:38,620 --> 04:30:39,220
I'm already behind.

3966
04:30:42,200 --> 04:30:43,320
Oh my god.

3967
04:30:46,680 --> 04:30:47,780
Oh my god.

3968
04:30:48,420 --> 04:30:50,420
You're trying to stall.

3969
04:30:51,300 --> 04:30:52,480
Okay, it's okay.

3970
04:30:55,220 --> 04:30:56,580
Oh my god.

3971
04:30:56,860 --> 04:30:57,780
Oh my god.

3972
04:30:57,800 --> 04:30:58,900
It was not okay.

3973
04:31:01,440 --> 04:31:03,380
Guys, it was not okay.

3974
04:31:04,080 --> 04:31:05,940
So, yeah, Spider-Man's stalling.

3975
04:31:08,060 --> 04:31:09,260
Guys, it was my fault.

3976
04:31:09,380 --> 04:31:10,160
I jinxed it.

3977
04:31:10,480 --> 04:31:11,800
I should have been humbled.

3978
04:31:12,440 --> 04:31:14,440
Guys, I should have been high.

3979
04:31:15,140 --> 04:31:16,340
I don't know why.

3980
04:31:17,200 --> 04:31:18,600
Why couldn't I have been humbled?

3981
04:31:19,220 --> 04:31:24,300
Oh, I don't think I could have saved you.

3982
04:31:25,400 --> 04:31:26,220
I don't.

3983
04:31:26,580 --> 04:31:27,780

I will admit, I fucked that up.

3989
04:32:22,150 --> 04:32:24,410
I should have said anything.

3990
04:32:24,650 --> 04:32:26,790
I shouldn't have said anything, guys.

3991
04:32:27,950 --> 04:32:29,590
I should have just let it happen.

3992
04:32:29,890 --> 04:32:30,790

I just think, like, legitimately think just unlucky teams
today.

3998
04:33:10,710 --> 04:33:14,410
Like, I literally lost the 50-50 90% of the time.

3999
04:33:15,470 --> 04:33:16,110
The top.

4000
04:33:17,210 --> 04:33:18,070
There's quite a little.

4001
04:33:19,570 --> 04:33:20,130
Cheat.

4002
04:33:22,510 --> 04:33:25,290
At least, I guess we're not going to top, guys.

4003
04:33:28,090 --> 04:33:29,610
I hope that...

4004
04:33:30,310 --> 04:33:30,870
Oh.

04:33:31,210 --> 04:33:31,870

04:33:46,900 --> 04:33:48,440
Because I think it's okay.

4011
04:33:49,180 --> 04:33:50,080

I've always believed.

4093
04:38:55,870 --> 04:38:56,830
We did it.

4094
04:38:59,970 --> 04:39:02,130
Guys, I've always believed in myself.

4095
04:39:02,950 --> 04:39:04,410
I don't know how it's needed.

4096
04:39:04,830 --> 04:39:06,970
No, I don't need it at all.

4097
04:39:08,210 --> 04:39:09,850
We fucking did it.

4098
04:39:10,730 --> 04:39:11,950
I don't know how.

4099
04:39:12,610 --> 04:39:13,350
But we did it.

4100
04:39:13,690 --> 04:39:16,650
I honestly don't know how this happened.

4101
04:39:19,670 --> 04:39:22,430
But, but we did it.

4102
04:39:25,950 --> 04:39:27,510
Believe in the humbleness.

4103
04:39:28,750 --> 04:39:29,250
Oh, 20.

4104
04:39:29,330 --> 04:39:30,330
At least I get 20.

4105
04:39:30,950 --> 04:39:32,030
At least we take this.

4106
04:39:32,450 --> 04:39:34,390
We actually take this.

4107
04:39:34,830 --> 04:39:35,810
I'm so humble.

4108
04:39:39,010 --> 04:39:39,810
So humble.

4109
04:39:42,670 --> 04:39:44,850
Only the humble and graceful victory.

4110
04:39:45,890 --> 04:39:46,930
I think that's what I need to do.

4111
04:39:50,410 --> 04:39:51,770
I think I just, that's all I need to do.

4112
04:39:55,360 --> 04:39:57,880
I just, I just gotta start being more humble.

4113
04:40:00,240 --> 04:40:04,040
Oh yeah, and then I need to do it not, it shouldn't be a
full screen.

4114
04:40:04,160 --> 04:40:06,180
Full screen was not, full screen is not.

4115
04:40:06,200 --> 04:40:13,900
it oh i'm going back to window i was not feeling the full
screen

4116
04:40:19,680 --> 04:40:25,440
the most humble streamer out there oh man thank you for
twitch prime thank you thank you uh shadow thank you for

4117
04:40:25,440 --> 04:40:28,120
gifting a tier one sub to player thank you thank you

4118
04:40:34,740 --> 04:40:43,300
show venom's butt please what's in it for me huh i usually
do it for free but now that I know how desperate you want

4119
04:40:43,300 --> 04:40:43,680
it.

4120
04:40:44,280 --> 04:40:46,280
Oh, what will you give in exchange?

4121
04:40:49,600 --> 04:40:53,580
Oh, it's because, like, my main monitor is 500 hertz.

4122
04:40:54,960 --> 04:40:56,780
Like, in the past, I don't have to.

4123
04:40:57,060 --> 04:40:58,260
You should just do full screen.

4124
04:40:59,040 --> 04:41:04,760
Because when you tap out, if all your monitors are the same
hertz and you tap out, it won't...

4125
04:41:04,760 --> 04:41:10,920
Or if all your monitors aren't the same hertz and you tap
out, it, like, does a whole...

4126
04:41:10,920 --> 04:41:11,660
It does a flicker.

4127
04:41:11,680 --> 04:41:14,360
because it has to go back to its original hertz.

4128
04:41:14,760 --> 04:41:18,820
So I've been doing, I have to do borderless because it's
very annoying when I'm tabbing out.

4129
04:41:18,960 --> 04:41:19,200
Yeah.

4130
04:41:19,820 --> 04:41:23,700
Because my three monitors aren't like the same hertz.

4131
04:41:23,840 --> 04:41:24,220
What do you mean?

4132
04:41:24,280 --> 04:41:26,500
Oh, I have a partnership with MSI.

4133
04:41:26,800 --> 04:41:32,520
And they gave me, if you do exclamation point MSI, they gave
me a free monitor because I'm sponsored by them.

4134
04:41:32,860 --> 04:41:33,900
Yay, so check it out.

4135
04:41:34,000 --> 04:41:35,120
It's actually really cool.

4136
04:41:35,520 --> 04:41:40,040
I got the 500 hertz monitor and I got top 500, like in two
days.

4137
04:41:40,040 --> 04:41:42,080
Was it exclamation point MSI?

4138
04:41:42,260 --> 04:41:43,400
Sorry, it's not MSI.

4139
04:41:45,380 --> 04:41:47,260
I don't remember what the command is.

4140
04:41:47,460 --> 04:41:49,040
I don't remember it.

4141
04:41:50,320 --> 04:41:51,260
Let me check.

4142
04:41:51,340 --> 04:41:53,000
I think that's on my YouTube.

4143
04:41:54,200 --> 04:41:55,440
I think that's the command.

4144
04:41:56,440 --> 04:41:56,920
Is it?

4145
04:41:57,240 --> 04:41:57,780
Oh, yeah.

4146
04:41:58,360 --> 04:42:03,520
My mod didn't put in the MSI command for...

4147
04:42:05,880 --> 04:42:06,480
For...

4148
04:42:08,460 --> 04:42:09,680
Yeah, for Twitch.

4149
04:42:10,040 --> 04:42:12,100
I only have it on... I only have it on YouTube.

4150
04:42:16,100 --> 04:42:18,580
I was like, I was like, MSI, and then...

4151
04:42:18,580 --> 04:42:19,560
Oh, is this Jitward?

4152
04:42:20,540 --> 04:42:21,520
Oh my god.

4153
04:42:21,700 --> 04:42:24,880
And then we have Storm, one trick, too.

4154
04:42:27,860 --> 04:42:28,680
That has to be Jitward.

4155
04:42:28,920 --> 04:42:29,640
He's the...

4156
04:42:29,640 --> 04:42:31,360
He's the...

4157
04:42:31,360 --> 04:42:32,720
Daredevil player.

4158
04:42:39,930 --> 04:42:40,850
Man in Ganymede?

4159
04:42:41,590 --> 04:42:42,990
Bro, are you putting me back on it?

4160
04:42:43,090 --> 04:42:43,590
Bro, I'm...

4161
04:42:44,110 --> 04:42:45,670
I can't do this again.

4162
04:42:46,230 --> 04:42:47,550
I can't.

4163
04:42:51,710 --> 04:42:53,130
God's strong enough.

4164
04:42:54,010 --> 04:42:55,530
Don't put me on it.

4165
04:42:55,730 --> 04:42:57,210
Please, I can't do this again.

4166
04:43:00,310 --> 04:43:02,830
I don't know if I'm strong enough.

4167
04:43:12,160 --> 04:43:13,300
Oh, no.

4168
04:43:15,280 --> 04:43:16,380
Oh, no.

4169
04:43:17,240 --> 04:43:18,440
Okay, I can do this.

4170
04:43:19,620 --> 04:43:21,280
I can't, but I can do this.

4171
04:43:23,700 --> 04:43:24,300
Yeah.

4172
04:43:24,320 --> 04:43:24,720
Yay!

4173
04:43:25,480 --> 04:43:26,420
Thank you, mine.

4174
04:43:27,420 --> 04:43:28,760
All right, we have our MSI.

4175
04:43:29,660 --> 04:43:31,960
Yeah, that's my sponsor.

4176
04:43:33,320 --> 04:43:35,140
I'm not the type who fades quietly.

4177
04:43:35,480 --> 04:43:35,960
I'm just trying to.

4178
04:43:37,500 --> 04:43:38,460
Oh, my God.

4179
04:43:38,700 --> 04:43:39,600
I'm fucking tired.

4180
04:43:40,900 --> 04:43:41,380
Someone.

4181
04:43:41,760 --> 04:43:43,320
Who looked at my stream.

4182
04:43:48,340 --> 04:43:49,760
Oh, my God.

4183
04:43:50,000 --> 04:43:51,020
And my team get...

4184
04:43:51,020 --> 04:43:51,900
Bro, okay, how much...

4185
04:43:51,900 --> 04:43:54,200
How many more handicaps do they want to give us?

4186
04:43:54,320 --> 04:43:55,660
I don't understand.

4187
04:43:56,040 --> 04:43:59,060
They already banned both my one-tricks players.

4188
04:43:59,540 --> 04:44:00,120
They...

4189
04:44:00,120 --> 04:44:00,980
Do they really...

4190
04:44:00,980 --> 04:44:01,840
Are they that desperate?

4191
04:44:05,060 --> 04:44:06,760
Hey, they took both of them.

4192
04:44:06,840 --> 04:44:10,820
They fucking took them back and bat and, like, smashed their
knees.

4193
04:44:11,120 --> 04:44:12,120
Like, I just...

4194
04:44:12,120 --> 04:44:13,200
Guys, come on.

4195
04:44:13,440 --> 04:44:14,640
Three seconds before you attack.

4196
04:44:14,960 --> 04:44:15,460
Get ready.

4197
04:44:16,100 --> 04:44:17,320
Come on, guys.

4198
04:44:17,720 --> 04:44:19,800
Did you really have to take both my one-tricks?

4199
04:44:24,250 --> 04:44:25,430
Like, come on.

4200
04:44:25,530 --> 04:44:26,530
Let one of them play.

4201
04:44:26,550 --> 04:44:27,450
or one trick.

4202
04:44:29,510 --> 04:44:30,690
Like, it's storm.

4203
04:44:31,370 --> 04:44:33,730
Like, at least let the storm play your one trick.

4204
04:44:36,910 --> 04:44:38,970
Yeah, the steel pipe to the shins.

4205
04:44:40,150 --> 04:44:41,770
At least we're doing trip.

4206
04:44:42,550 --> 04:44:43,970
Trip is nice.

4207
04:44:52,360 --> 04:44:57,480
Okay, we know our Spider-Man is better than...

4208
04:44:57,480 --> 04:44:58,420
Oh, okay.

4209
04:44:59,880 --> 04:45:01,420

I had made an attempt to touch it.

4247
04:48:08,700 --> 04:48:09,300
Okay.

4248
04:48:09,560 --> 04:48:09,960
Okay.

4250
04:48:11,240 --> 04:48:16,700
but they're they're on the slightly better they're on the
slightly better comp do you know why because they have

4251
04:48:16,700 --> 04:48:27,200
double tanks so um because when you're running triple
support you need to have two tanks so they may or may not be

04:48:27,200 --> 04:48:40,880
on the slightly better comp just maybe just maybe i'm not

04:49:25,920 --> 04:49:26,520

Like, so as in, like, I feel like I'd do so much.

4291
04:52:20,920 --> 04:52:22,680
I'd have to do so much.

4292
04:52:24,780 --> 04:52:32,320
Like, guys, remember how fucking fun and calm and easy Gab
it is compared to all the stuff I have to do as Invisib

4293
04:52:32,320 --> 04:52:32,620
woman?

4294
04:52:34,320 --> 04:52:36,100
30 seconds before you attack.

4295
04:52:36,440 --> 04:52:36,960
Get ready.

4296
04:52:37,780 --> 04:52:38,580

4298
04:52:39,620 --> 04:52:41,200
You can't say it.

4299
04:52:42,920 --> 04:52:48,540
It's okay, I'm a woman too, so I give myself a pass.

4300
04:52:52,480 --> 04:52:55,200
Gambit is actually like on a five-star vacation.

4301
04:52:58,780 --> 04:53:00,320
Yeah, that's true.

4302
04:53:03,840 --> 04:53:04,280
Yes.

4303
04:53:08,800 --> 04:53:09,500
All right, it's fine.

4304
04:53:09,640 --> 04:53:10,600
We don't have a Loki.

4305
04:53:10,780 --> 04:53:13,140
Like what the fuck is he gonna do with Moon Knight?

4306
04:53:13,340 --> 04:53:13,800
Oh wait.

4307
04:53:13,800 --> 04:53:16,320
Oh, I forgot the combo.

4308
04:53:19,060 --> 04:53:20,800

I'll push the card a little bit.

4312
04:53:29,180 --> 04:53:31,640
Like, we have two other supports that...

4313
04:53:31,640 --> 04:53:33,420
That's enough healing for them.

4314
04:53:33,740 --> 04:53:34,820
Oh, wait, they don't have a group.

4315
04:53:34,900 --> 04:53:36,680
Why the fuck did they went Moon Knight?

4316
04:53:37,180 --> 04:53:39,360

But, like, somehow...

4331
04:55:19,150 --> 04:55:20,110
Oh, my God.

The fact that this Daredevil is willing to 1v1 you because
he is that confident.

Well, I've been streaming.

4562
05:16:06,240 --> 05:16:07,040
Oh, my God.

4563
05:16:07,780 --> 05:16:09,340
I've not slept yet, guys.

4564
05:16:12,040 --> 05:16:14,560
I do not have a problem.

4565
05:16:17,680 --> 05:16:19,540
Streamer spotted who.

4566
05:16:21,020 --> 05:16:23,400
Can't be me, because I'm out of here.

4567
05:16:27,120 --> 05:16:27,400
Alright.

4568
05:16:28,240 --> 05:16:29,760
Oh, guys, just Assyrian Prince.

4569
05:16:29,920 --> 05:16:31,120
I'm going to lose so much.

4570
05:16:31,380 --> 05:16:33,220
I am going to lose so much, you know.

4571
05:16:34,040 --> 05:16:37,620
Why the fuck does the other team have an MRC winner?

4572
05:16:40,160 --> 05:16:40,960
Oh, God.

4573
05:16:41,220 --> 05:16:43,420
Okay, alohi.

4574
05:16:45,800 --> 05:16:48,320
Guys, I can't sleep though.

4575
05:16:48,760 --> 05:16:49,920
I'm not dying.

4576
05:16:51,040 --> 05:16:56,300
All I need, all I need is my vivables.

4577
05:16:57,760 --> 05:16:58,900
It's not sad.

4578
05:17:00,980 --> 05:17:02,100
Only for today.

4579
05:17:02,760 --> 05:17:10,740
Like I said, I feel like, I honestly feel like Rink is so
much more toxic now.

4580
05:17:12,720 --> 05:17:14,200
Compared to...

4581
05:17:14,200 --> 05:17:16,220
I think rank is actually like...

4582
05:17:16,820 --> 05:17:19,270
It's not like fun toxic anymore.

4583
05:17:20,320 --> 05:17:21,580
It's actually mean.

4584
05:17:22,160 --> 05:17:24,280
People are sort of really mean now.

4585
05:17:27,480 --> 05:17:31,240
I think people got a lot worse in rank.

4586
05:17:32,080 --> 05:17:33,000
What the fuck?

4587
05:17:38,940 --> 05:17:43,000
So I can only do this in like small doses.

4588
05:17:45,180 --> 05:17:47,720
Unless someone else yells at me and then I'll go live.

4589
05:17:49,080 --> 05:17:50,140
That's the only thing I...

4590
05:17:50,660 --> 05:17:52,940
Unless I get yelled at, then I'll go...

4591
05:17:55,540 --> 05:17:56,960
Then I'll go live.

4592
05:17:57,200 --> 05:18:00,360
Because I'm not gonna get yelled at for free.

4593
05:18:03,280 --> 05:18:03,880
I cannot.

4594
05:18:05,140 --> 05:18:05,500
Please.

4595
05:18:08,880 --> 05:18:09,900
I don't know.

4596
05:18:10,860 --> 05:18:12,820
When I say I cannot, I cannot.

4597
05:18:15,600 --> 05:18:19,260
I'm not batting hell anymore with zero DPS players is a
choice.

4598
05:18:20,880 --> 05:18:24,660
Why do we plan to take takes when we all be had our take
players, guys?

4599
05:18:25,440 --> 05:18:27,380
I am accused of loving...

4600
05:18:27,380 --> 05:18:27,980
Broken bond.

4601
05:18:28,180 --> 05:18:29,240

Thank you.

4603
05:18:29,820 --> 05:18:31,980
It wasn't today supposed to be a rest day.

4604
05:18:32,120 --> 05:18:34,980
Yes, but then I got yelled at by two pro players.

4605
05:18:35,300 --> 05:18:36,380
And then I got sad.

4606
05:18:37,180 --> 05:18:40,480
And then so then I was like, I'm going to stream because
they yelled at me.

had to stand in front of the gambit it was the only way It
was truly the only way.

4622
05:21:22,910 --> 05:21:24,390
Maybe I can Kobe that.

4623
05:21:25,330 --> 05:21:32,870
The fact that I had to stand in front of my gamut to get
healed was a little concerning, but that's the case.

4624
05:21:33,750 --> 05:21:34,270
Sometimes...

4625
05:21:34,270 --> 05:21:36,290
Oh, I would have damage boosted him if I...

4626
05:21:36,290 --> 05:21:37,930
Oh, he's fucking gone.

4627
05:21:38,630 --> 05:21:40,690
He is so... He's alive.

4628
05:21:40,810 --> 05:21:41,190
He's alive.

4629
05:21:41,230 --> 05:21:41,930
I've always believed.

4630
05:21:42,070 --> 05:21:42,750
I've always believed.

4631
05:21:46,630 --> 05:21:48,190
I'm slowly backing up.

4632
05:21:49,330 --> 05:21:52,970
Because I am slowly not feeling very good about this.

4633
05:21:53,430 --> 05:21:53,970
Alright, nice.

4634
05:21:55,710 --> 05:21:57,310
And now I leave.

4635
05:22:00,110 --> 05:22:01,670
Oh my god, okay.

4636
05:22:06,200 --> 05:22:07,880
Oh, wait, we got...

4637
05:22:07,880 --> 05:22:08,760
Oh my gosh.

4638
05:22:09,220 --> 05:22:10,480
Avery, I think?

4639
05:22:10,840 --> 05:22:11,180
Yeah.

4640
05:22:11,860 --> 05:22:12,600
That's Avery.

4641
05:22:15,120 --> 05:22:16,260
I'm trying.

4642
05:22:16,600 --> 05:22:18,000
I'm trying to keep you up.

4643
05:22:19,820 --> 05:22:22,300
I need you to know I saved your life.

4644
05:22:22,680 --> 05:22:23,680
You're fucking old.

4645

4646
05:22:36,860 --> 05:22:37,420

4647
05:22:37,880 --> 05:22:39,960
See I have nothing for hello.

4648
05:22:40,760 --> 05:22:52,320
Haha, I have this though It'll be fine I have All right.

4649
05:22:52,700 --> 05:22:53,700

05:22:53,840 --> 05:22:54,980
Oh, oops.

4651
05:22:55,260 --> 05:22:56,040
Sorry, that was my bad.

4652
05:22:56,900 --> 05:22:57,540
That was my bad.

4653
05:22:57,660 --> 05:22:58,340
I got scared.

4654
05:22:59,000 --> 05:22:59,920
I got scared.

4655
05:23:00,540 --> 05:23:00,820
You know?

4656
05:23:02,820 --> 05:23:04,880
Now we definitely don't have anything.

4657
05:23:05,680 --> 05:23:06,420
That was my bad.

4658
05:23:06,620 --> 05:23:07,600
That was actually my bad.

4659
05:23:08,660 --> 05:23:10,160
I just got very scared.

4660
05:23:15,380 --> 05:23:18,820
I definitely, I definitely maybe should not have loaded
that.

4661
05:23:18,820 --> 05:23:19,720
I'm sorry.

4662
05:23:19,880 --> 05:23:21,040
I got very scared.

4663
05:23:21,080 --> 05:23:21,260
Alright.

4664
05:23:22,280 --> 05:23:22,720
Reset.

4665
05:23:26,560 --> 05:23:27,040
Unless...

4666
05:23:29,800 --> 05:23:31,140
No, that's Avery.

4667
05:23:31,480 --> 05:23:39,340
Because Avery used to be a Fortnite player and then and then
and then he just makes they don't have anything.

4668
05:23:39,780 --> 05:23:42,740
And then he fucking named alt accounts after Fortnite
players.

4669
05:23:42,760 --> 05:23:45,700
I didn't say for him, but I think I learned Jeff would have
died.

4670
05:23:46,900 --> 05:23:47,580
If I didn't know.

4671
05:23:47,720 --> 05:23:47,940
If I did.

4672
05:23:49,560 --> 05:23:54,360
Oh When you when you ult a three I have to pop or fuck you.

4673
05:23:54,460 --> 05:23:57,940
It's gonna kill you All right, here we go.

4674
05:23:57,940 --> 05:23:59,240
Hey guys, someone's asleep

4675
05:24:05,460 --> 05:24:06,740

4676
05:24:08,460 --> 05:24:13,120

Nice I am... You're alive?

4678
05:24:26,120 --> 05:24:28,380
Wait, we can stagger... Oh, we hear a staggered air.

4679
05:24:29,040 --> 05:24:29,240
Wait.

4680
05:24:30,800 --> 05:24:31,280
Nice.

4681
05:24:31,440 --> 05:24:31,640
Okay.

4682
05:24:32,180 --> 05:24:33,180
Okay, he's the last one.

4683
05:24:33,780 --> 05:24:34,240
That's okay.

4684
05:24:34,480 --> 05:24:35,560
We're doing it.

4685
05:24:36,200 --> 05:24:37,360
It swallows Jeff.

4686
05:24:38,100 --> 05:24:38,580
Oh my god.

4687
05:24:38,620 --> 05:24:38,760
See?

4688
05:24:38,840 --> 05:24:41,180
See, this Jeff knows how to play the game.

4689
05:24:44,860 --> 05:24:45,340
Whoops.

4690
05:24:46,180 --> 05:24:46,620
It's okay.

4691
05:24:47,860 --> 05:24:48,560
Everything's fine.

4692
05:24:49,280 --> 05:24:50,260
Be humble, Doki.

4693
05:24:50,540 --> 05:24:51,100
Be humble.

4694
05:24:52,840 --> 05:24:54,540
Don't be too overconfident.

4695
05:24:55,580 --> 05:24:56,440
Anything can happen.

4696
05:24:59,280 --> 05:25:01,080
Yeah, that Jeff knows how to swallow.

4697
05:25:01,540 --> 05:25:04,180
I'm pretty sure I missed my Maggle on the C&D, but I got the
kill set.

4698
05:25:04,240 --> 05:25:05,680
30 seconds before you attack.

4699
05:25:06,040 --> 05:25:07,540
Oh, it's the splash damage.

4700
05:25:09,140 --> 05:25:10,640
It's the fucking splash damage.

4701
05:25:11,420 --> 05:25:12,240
Yeah, I was watching her.

4702
05:25:12,280 --> 05:25:14,280
She walked left after you threw it to the right.

4703
05:25:14,460 --> 05:25:16,000
So I think she, like, walked right into it.

4704
05:25:16,260 --> 05:25:17,600
That was a long time ago.

4705
05:25:18,420 --> 05:25:20,120
No, Jeff swallows N-spit.

4706
05:25:20,220 --> 05:25:21,120
Do you not see the bubbles?

4707
05:25:21,340 --> 05:25:33,620

4715
05:26:08,180 --> 05:26:09,080
Gambit never what?

4716

I knew he was gonna be alive.

4725
05:26:34,240 --> 05:26:35,200
Always believe in him.

4726
05:26:36,500 --> 05:26:37,380
Never doubted.

4727
05:26:38,600 --> 05:26:39,760
Jesus Christ, okay.

4728
05:26:43,550 --> 05:26:45,610
I don't know what the fuck is going on right now.

4729
05:26:45,750 --> 05:26:47,890

Oh, my gosh.

4735
05:26:55,310 --> 05:26:56,070

4736
05:26:56,810 --> 05:26:59,770
Oh Oh, he was so low.

Oh, my God.

05:27:40,510 --> 05:27:41,490
I thought he was going to hit him.

4755

I, I, okay, I don't know if you guys saw this, but like, I
waited.

4756
05:27:45,410 --> 05:27:47,090
I waited for him to...

4757
05:27:48,930 --> 05:27:53,310
Like, I waited for him to shoot the name more, and he didn't
shoot him.

4758
05:27:56,230 --> 05:27:56,750
understand

4759
05:28:00,350 --> 05:28:09,990

stared at him I was like yeah you're gonna do it right and

4760
05:28:09,990 --> 05:28:20,630

4762
05:28:27,390 --> 05:28:28,650
Oh, they had someone left.

4763
05:28:33,990 --> 05:28:34,330
Poor hell.

4764
05:28:35,550 --> 05:28:37,210
That would fit...

4765
05:28:37,210 --> 05:28:37,890
Yeah, no.

4766
05:28:38,390 --> 05:28:40,890
Apparently our team was definitely broken.

4767
05:28:42,710 --> 05:28:44,170
We take those.

4768
05:28:44,550 --> 05:28:44,950
Yay!

4769
05:28:45,210 --> 05:28:46,490
We take those.

4770
05:28:47,830 --> 05:28:48,690
That's great.

4771
05:28:49,150 --> 05:28:49,830
Thank God.

4772
05:28:50,130 --> 05:28:51,890
Thank God we actually have...

4773
05:28:51,890 --> 05:28:56,170
We actually had the players for once in our lives.

4774
05:28:57,770 --> 05:28:58,530
Okay.

4775
05:28:59,090 --> 05:29:00,310
That's crazy.

4776
05:29:00,650 --> 05:29:03,490
I didn't know how that felt until now.

4777
05:29:05,270 --> 05:29:08,810
I didn't know how that felt like having real players.

4778
05:29:11,390 --> 05:29:13,290
Will she get back to Celestia 2?

4779
05:29:15,530 --> 05:29:20,270
The better question is, will she be ranked in Dramaster?

4780
05:29:23,370 --> 05:29:25,770
That's the better question.

4781
05:29:26,090 --> 05:29:26,970
Will I survive?

4782
05:29:32,610 --> 05:29:38,290
Oh, at least Venom's here to turn me up.

4783
05:29:38,490 --> 05:29:38,750
Yeah!

4784
05:29:39,330 --> 05:29:46,690
But um, but um, but um, but um, but um, but um, but um, but
um, but um, but um, but is Choppa climbing?

4785
05:29:46,810 --> 05:29:48,830
He asked me to play like a while ago.

4786
05:29:49,690 --> 05:29:50,730
Oh, he got back.

4787
05:29:51,010 --> 05:29:51,910
Good for him.

4788
05:29:53,590 --> 05:29:54,830
Good for him.

4789
05:29:55,110 --> 05:29:58,310
But I was already in a duo, so I was like, sorry, Choppa.

4790
05:30:01,130 --> 05:30:02,170
Why are you not live?

4791
05:30:02,690 --> 05:30:07,710
Because I want to feel a pain.

4792
05:30:08,770 --> 05:30:10,050
Oh, okay.

4793
05:30:10,370 --> 05:30:11,030
I'll be late.

4794
05:30:11,170 --> 05:30:11,510
All right.

Let me, I bookmarked some stuff.

4816
05:31:17,740 --> 05:31:20,600
I knew that if I had anything, I would want, oh yeah.

4817
05:31:21,000 --> 05:31:26,720
Do you guys know that uh, oh my gosh, what is this?

4818
05:31:26,860 --> 05:31:28,720
Oh, guys, do you guys know about the Kabuto shit?

4819
05:31:29,000 --> 05:31:30,160
That shit is crazy.

4820
05:31:32,300 --> 05:31:32,700
Bruh.

4821
05:31:32,860 --> 05:31:43,980
the kabuto market uh we're like uh okay so you know how
there's a pokemon card market um we're like you know

4822
05:31:43,980 --> 05:31:51,940
scalpers and stuff like that and we're like people are
scalping pokemon cards and like selling like buying selling

4823
05:31:51,940 --> 05:32:02,180
pokemon cards so there's one guy who's fucking obsessed with
this one pokemon called kabuto and the thing about it is

4824
05:32:02,180 --> 05:32:12,160
that i swear to god is fantastic uh fantastic is a fantastic
player i swear to fucking god anyway so the whole premise is

4825
05:32:12,160 --> 05:32:21,940
that he's the kabuto guy and his entire okay sorry i just
have to figure out like what the fuck is is my team i just

4826
05:32:21,940 --> 05:32:34,820
had to i have to process this okay okay is my team decent or
not um and he only collects first edition kabuto cards so

4827
05:32:34,820 --> 05:32:44,420
originally apparently the card was originally like less than
one dollar and through his efforts because his whole mission

4828
05:32:44,420 --> 05:32:51,800
is that you are not okay i swear to god if you guys do not
ban daredevil next i swear to fucking god like oh thank god

4829
05:32:51,800 --> 05:32:59,680
okay um sorry i i'm just getting distracted by my team um
and he raised sit to like because he's been trying to buy

4830
05:32:59,680 --> 05:33:12,000
every single fucking kibuto um he raised the market value
for the card to i think like 30 plus dollars per card and

4831
05:33:12,000 --> 05:33:19,200
now scalpers are hoarding kibuto cards because they think
it's like the stock market where they're like oh yeah he's

4832
05:33:19,200 --> 05:33:25,340
like he's like upping the price value of them so like we
should just we should hoard these cards so like it'll get

4833
05:33:25,340 --> 05:33:36,060
higher and yeah but then scalpers are making it not fun by
hoarding the cards now so that's not the best yeah because

4834
05:33:36,060 --> 05:33:44,980
they're like oh the card value yeah but yeah i know but he's
literally the only buyer yeah he

4835
05:33:48,370 --> 05:33:57,470
created all the demand so so scalpers are also like it's
like stock market it's like your very own babies for stock

4836
05:33:57,470 --> 05:34:04,730
market where they're buying the kubuto cards too like
scalpers are also buying the kubuto cards and artificially

4837
05:34:04,730 --> 05:34:16,690
uh artificially like uh increasing the value of it even
though like he's he's literally the only customer he's the

4838
05:34:16,690 --> 05:34:26,210
only customer for the kubuto cards none of your business
when you enter my realm i will No, not everything.

4839
05:34:28,450 --> 05:34:30,010
And just put it here.

4840
05:34:30,910 --> 05:34:32,210
There's no way to know, right?

4841
05:34:32,550 --> 05:34:33,750
It's right here.

05:40:03,880 --> 05:40:04,700
Let's go.

4967
05:40:05,200 --> 05:40:06,800
Yeah, we just need to start rushing up, though.

4968
05:40:07,080 --> 05:40:07,700
Let's go.

4969
05:40:08,280 --> 05:40:08,640
Let's see.

4970
05:40:08,800 --> 05:40:10,080
He asked for a Jeff.

4971
05:40:10,440 --> 05:40:10,840

4972
05:40:14,080 --> 05:40:15,600
Good luck, everyone.

4973
05:40:16,680 --> 05:40:17,280
Good luck.

4974
05:40:18,580 --> 05:40:19,820
Good luck, everyone.

4975
05:40:20,800 --> 05:40:22,620
I think things are working.

4976
05:40:28,250 --> 05:40:28,970
I think.

4977
05:40:32,180 --> 05:40:33,890
Oh my god, hey guys.

05:40:55,390 --> 05:40:58,170
I'm just gonna save this until I know.

4983
05:41:00,610 --> 05:41:01,970
Until I know what to do.

4984
05:41:04,330 --> 05:41:05,590
Oh, it's okay.

4985
05:41:08,490 --> 05:41:09,210
It's okay.

4986
05:41:09,850 --> 05:41:11,510
I'm just eating business stuff.

4987
05:41:15,540 --> 05:41:16,480
Alright, there we go.

4988
05:41:17,280 --> 05:41:19,200
Oh my god, look at that, nice.

Oh, when I'm hungry.

4991
05:41:26,140 --> 05:41:27,480

05:43:36,060 --> 05:43:36,720
He's won.

5018
05:43:37,260 --> 05:43:37,660

05:43:42,260 --> 05:43:42,860
I fucked up.

05:43:43,120 --> 05:43:43,840
But we still did it.

5022
05:43:43,880 --> 05:43:45,140
I swore I'm getting rage baited.

5023
05:43:45,540 --> 05:43:50,160
Like, I've been, like, one shot at five times, and then I
got mad.

5024
05:43:51,480 --> 05:43:51,520
It's okay.

5025
05:43:51,580 --> 05:43:51,880
It's okay.

5026
05:43:51,940 --> 05:43:52,740
Never punished.

5027
05:43:53,180 --> 05:43:53,520
Never punished.

5028
05:43:53,580 --> 05:43:54,580
This is an egregious game.

5029
05:43:54,800 --> 05:43:56,420
Like, I don't know why I came back to this shit.

5030
05:43:57,320 --> 05:43:57,900
It's okay.

5031
05:43:58,340 --> 05:43:59,500
I'm just doing business.

5032
05:43:59,980 --> 05:44:00,200
I'm just...

5033
05:44:00,880 --> 05:44:01,600
I tried.

5034
05:44:01,840 --> 05:44:02,820
That's what matters.

5035
05:44:03,300 --> 05:44:04,020
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

5036
05:44:04,180 --> 05:44:04,340
You're right.

5037
05:44:05,900 --> 05:44:06,260
You're right.

5038
05:44:06,260 --> 05:44:07,440
All part of the plan.

5039
05:44:07,780 --> 05:44:09,420
Honestly, I don't know what you play, bro.

5040
05:44:09,500 --> 05:44:09,860
You're lucky.

5041
05:44:11,680 --> 05:44:13,840
I was trying to just run three tanks and run them down.

5042
05:44:13,920 --> 05:44:15,360
I'm not even like, oh, that has me.

5043
05:44:15,540 --> 05:44:17,400
That is what would happen.

5044
05:44:18,500 --> 05:44:21,300
Like, you should unironically just...

5045
05:44:21,300 --> 05:44:21,980
I don't know how to...

5046
05:44:21,980 --> 05:44:23,260
I don't know how to all that's, Jeff.

5047
05:44:23,540 --> 05:44:24,320
That is.

5048
05:44:24,320 --> 05:44:24,960
I'm just...

5049
05:44:24,960 --> 05:44:25,900
I'm feeling it.

5050
05:44:25,960 --> 05:44:27,320
I'm just playing off of vibes.

5051
05:44:28,240 --> 05:44:29,500
It's just off of vibes.

5052
05:44:30,480 --> 05:44:31,640
I don't know what I'm...

5053
05:44:31,640 --> 05:44:32,520
It's just vibes.

5054
05:44:33,400 --> 05:44:35,060
It is not fun.

5055
05:44:35,540 --> 05:44:37,220
You should hit that bubble and run after.

5056
05:44:41,430 --> 05:44:42,950
This is not...

5057
05:44:42,950 --> 05:44:43,010
Okay.

5058
05:44:44,050 --> 05:44:45,990

5083
05:47:21,960 --> 05:47:22,200

5087
05:47:51,440 --> 05:47:52,420
I might have to swap.

5088
05:47:52,560 --> 05:47:54,080
I don't think this is it.

5089
05:47:54,400 --> 05:47:57,220
I'll do one more death.

5090
05:47:58,000 --> 05:47:58,740
I'll do one more.

5091
05:47:59,300 --> 05:48:00,100
And then I'm swapping.

5092
05:48:00,360 --> 05:48:02,100
I think it works on defense.

5093
05:48:02,540 --> 05:48:06,500
But like, I legitimately do not think I'm cut up for a
shark.

5094
05:48:12,140 --> 05:48:13,700
What up, what up, what up?

5095
05:48:15,260 --> 05:48:15,920
He's winning.

5096
05:48:19,400 --> 05:48:20,720
I can't see you from there, bro.

5097
05:48:21,360 --> 05:48:24,560
All right, it's okay.

5098
05:48:24,940 --> 05:48:27,280
All right.

5099
05:48:28,100 --> 05:48:31,520
Who is he on?

5100
05:48:31,780 --> 05:48:32,700

5101
05:48:32,860 --> 05:48:37,160
I'm spraying and praying and hoping that I'm doing
everything I need to do.

5102
05:48:37,820 --> 05:48:38,540
I'm just spraying.

5103
05:48:38,820 --> 05:48:39,880
I'm doing it.

5104
05:48:40,220 --> 05:48:42,400

point it's it's happens it's just bait i there it is just

5117
05:50:06,710 --> 05:50:11,030

5118
05:50:15,030 --> 05:50:18,230
i legitimately don't think i can do anything else

5119
05:50:27,670 --> 05:50:29,930
I don't know.

5120
05:50:30,090 --> 05:50:31,530
I think I wasted that, but that's fine.

5121
05:50:32,130 --> 05:50:32,730
I got scared.

5122
05:50:36,810 --> 05:50:38,010
Oh, my.

5123
05:50:38,770 --> 05:50:40,130
Is this winnable?

5124
05:50:41,150 --> 05:50:41,970
No, it's not.

5125
05:50:43,210 --> 05:50:43,810
It's not.

5126
05:50:44,730 --> 05:50:46,890
Yeah, yeah, guys.

Fourth time's the charm.

5129
05:50:54,910 --> 05:50:58,670
I don't think they realize how many times I think I've not
been blamed yet.

5130
05:50:58,750 --> 05:51:00,510
I think I will be very soon.

5131
05:51:01,350 --> 05:51:02,670
So this is my last attempt.

5132
05:51:04,770 --> 05:51:06,630
This is my last attempt.

5133
05:51:13,150 --> 05:51:14,930

05:51:54,070 --> 05:51:54,290
It's fine.

5140
05:51:54,510 --> 05:51:56,490
I said that was my last chance.

5141
05:51:56,990 --> 05:51:58,610
I saved my team, though.

5142
05:51:58,710 --> 05:51:59,970
Guys, I need you to know.

5143
05:52:00,850 --> 05:52:02,430
I saved my team.

5144
05:52:04,990 --> 05:52:08,630
It was worth it because I did save.

5145
05:52:09,050 --> 05:52:09,910
Are you serious?

5146
05:52:10,230 --> 05:52:15,010
What the fuck shot me from all the way there?

5147
05:52:17,810 --> 05:52:18,390
Oh, no.

5148
05:52:19,010 --> 05:52:19,430
Oh, no.

5149
05:52:19,470 --> 05:52:23,230
I had to push the res closer because...

5150
05:52:24,110 --> 05:52:27,050
Okay, okay, if he dies, if he dies, I do have a res right
here.

5151
05:52:29,310 --> 05:52:33,350
Okay, we don't have res, we don't have support else anymore.

5152
05:52:34,150 --> 05:52:43,610
So, oh my god, save our Invis.

5153
05:52:43,850 --> 05:52:44,930
She's our only hope.

5154
05:52:45,530 --> 05:52:46,310
Save our Invis.

5155
05:52:47,510 --> 05:52:48,790
She's our only hope.

5156
05:52:53,430 --> 05:52:55,110
This is just Maggie, she's fine.

5157
05:52:56,750 --> 05:53:01,770

that game.

I deserve to get carried after everything I've been through.

5179
05:56:26,350 --> 05:56:28,390
You guys can't say that I'm wrong.

5180
05:56:29,270 --> 05:56:35,530
I deserve to get carried after everything I've been through
the entire six hours.

5181
05:56:40,070 --> 05:56:42,330
With all the other games I have to go through.

5182
05:56:43,530 --> 05:56:47,670
Now, I deserve to have one game that I get to get carried.

06:03:09,680 --> 06:03:11,960
I don't know what else I can play at this point.

5273
06:03:13,300 --> 06:03:17,320
Like, uh, yeah, definitely not Luna with that cop.

5274
06:03:17,760 --> 06:03:20,820
I guess I could technically play Loki.

5275

06:04:56,200 --> 06:04:58,120
I'm on high ground.

5299
06:05:01,620 --> 06:05:02,460

Wait a minute.

5302
06:05:07,880 --> 06:05:08,780
Wait a minute.

5303
06:05:08,960 --> 06:05:09,840
What is he doing there?

5304
06:05:10,380 --> 06:05:10,520
Wait.

5305
06:05:13,080 --> 06:05:15,160
He doesn't see this, right?

5306
06:05:16,060 --> 06:05:18,820
Okay, sentry, sentry, sentry, bro.

5307
06:05:21,660 --> 06:05:23,060
Oh my god.

5308
06:05:23,060 --> 06:05:23,120
Oh.

5309
06:05:25,760 --> 06:05:27,960
Don't mess with the amazing spider.

5310
06:05:27,980 --> 06:05:28,680
Hey guys.

5311
06:05:29,320 --> 06:05:30,560
Hey, are we still okay?

5312
06:05:30,780 --> 06:05:31,820
Are we still cooking?

5313
06:05:32,120 --> 06:05:33,580
I don't think we're okay anymore.

5314
06:05:36,420 --> 06:05:36,860
There's...

5315
06:05:36,860 --> 06:05:38,420
Okay, we got that out.

5316
06:05:38,560 --> 06:05:39,300
We got that out.

5317
06:05:39,940 --> 06:05:40,760
Guys, we got that.

5318
06:05:41,080 --> 06:05:42,160
We got two ults out.

5319
06:05:45,300 --> 06:05:46,360
Look at that.

5320
06:05:46,520 --> 06:05:46,880
Look at that.

5321
06:05:46,960 --> 06:05:47,020
Look at that.

5322
06:05:47,020 --> 06:05:47,960
We got two ults out.

5323
06:05:48,080 --> 06:05:48,500
There we go.

5324
06:05:48,560 --> 06:05:48,760
There we go.

5325
06:05:48,880 --> 06:05:49,620
That's how we do it.

5326
06:05:50,260 --> 06:05:50,700
Nice.

5327
06:05:50,960 --> 06:05:53,560
And then are we gonna, okay, we're not gonna kill him.

5328
06:05:53,600 --> 06:05:54,020
That's fine.

5329
06:05:54,140 --> 06:05:54,960
That's okay, too.

5330
06:05:55,320 --> 06:05:55,980
That's okay.

5331
06:05:56,160 --> 06:05:57,360
We don't need to kill him

5332
06:06:00,400 --> 06:06:01,220
Where's she coming?

5333
06:06:03,960 --> 06:06:04,740
You are

5334
06:06:09,520 --> 06:06:25,520
Okay, I'm just gonna be over here Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Okay,
okay, okay guys, okay, okay.

5335
06:06:26,180 --> 06:06:26,960
I cannot.

5336
06:06:29,480 --> 06:06:31,460
Guys, guys, please.

5337
06:06:34,900 --> 06:06:36,620
All right, there you go, there you go.

5338
06:06:36,960 --> 06:06:37,360
There you go.

5339
06:06:38,760 --> 06:06:40,000
Guys, guys, we can't leave for it.

5340
06:06:40,460 --> 06:06:42,460
I swear to God, we can't leave for it.

5341
06:06:42,460 --> 06:06:44,200
Okay, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone.

5342
06:06:44,700 --> 06:06:46,800
All right, and now they, okay, it's not winnable anymore.

5343
06:06:46,900 --> 06:06:47,780
It's not winnable anymore.

5344
06:06:48,200 --> 06:06:50,160
It is absolutely not winnable anymore.

5345
06:06:53,600 --> 06:06:54,960
I just...

5346
06:06:54,960 --> 06:06:57,300
I did live forever.

5347
06:06:57,440 --> 06:06:58,760
I knew it wasn't winnable.

5348
06:07:03,460 --> 06:07:05,280
That is so unlucky.

5349
06:07:05,580 --> 06:07:08,540
I felt like I did so much there.

5350
06:07:17,270 --> 06:07:21,150
When the chips are down, you want your heroes a little
roguish and scruffy.

5351
06:07:21,510 --> 06:07:21,850
Like me.

5352
06:07:23,150 --> 06:07:24,390
Oh my god.

5353
06:07:28,430 --> 06:07:30,430
No, it was not winnable.

5354
06:07:31,190 --> 06:07:31,650
It was...

5355
06:07:31,670 --> 06:07:33,830
I was crawling everywhere.

5356
06:07:38,770 --> 06:07:40,030
I was literally crawling everywhere.

5357
06:07:40,150 --> 06:07:42,090
I don't think going Loki would help anything.

5358
06:07:43,750 --> 06:07:45,350
I legit don't think...

5359
06:07:45,350 --> 06:07:47,110
I don't think Loki would do anything.

5360
06:07:47,370 --> 06:07:48,090
I have to...

5361
06:07:51,230 --> 06:07:53,650
I'm like crawling everywhere on rockets.

5362
06:07:53,910 --> 06:07:56,590
The fact that I live so long just fucking flying everywhere.

5363
06:07:57,690 --> 06:08:00,090
Bro, I don't think bro...

5364
06:08:02,190 --> 06:08:03,890
Bro, I don't think bro...

5365
06:08:04,090 --> 06:08:04,850
We have...

5366
06:08:05,450 --> 06:08:07,150
Bro, I don't think you're going to get that.

5367
06:08:07,490 --> 06:08:11,830
Bro, this guy is a Storm Fantastic player.

5368
06:08:14,670 --> 06:08:17,070
He is not swapping.

5369
06:08:19,170 --> 06:08:19,990
Good luck.

5370
06:08:21,330 --> 06:08:21,930
Good luck.

5371
06:08:22,210 --> 06:08:22,930
And I think...

5372
06:08:25,670 --> 06:08:27,650
And they're running triple support.

5373
06:08:27,950 --> 06:08:29,270
Oh my god, I didn't even see that.

5374
06:08:29,290 --> 06:08:31,230
Who the fuck took my beacon?

5375
06:08:31,910 --> 06:08:33,730
I didn't even see who took it.

5376
06:08:34,850 --> 06:08:41,250
I don't know, I feel like, eh, what would be?

5377
06:08:41,410 --> 06:08:45,210
Nah, I think if I was Luna, I'd get, like, extra fucked in
general.

5378
06:08:46,130 --> 06:08:48,370
I think, like, they would, I would not be alive.

5379
06:08:49,030 --> 06:08:55,230
I feel like, I'm literally doing my best, like, trying to
stay alive here.

5380
06:08:56,210 --> 06:09:01,030
And trying to pocket my Invis so much, like, literally,
this.

5381
06:09:02,950 --> 06:09:04,070
Oh, yeah.

5382
06:09:04,090 --> 06:09:05,070
My god.

5383
06:09:06,170 --> 06:09:06,730
Hello.

5384
06:09:08,040 --> 06:09:08,690
Hello.

5385
06:09:10,110 --> 06:09:10,430
Hello.

5386
06:09:11,990 --> 06:09:13,210
Oh, goodbye.

5387
06:09:13,850 --> 06:09:15,250
He missed.

5388
06:09:15,830 --> 06:09:16,830
He...

5389
06:09:16,830 --> 06:09:17,870
He...

5390
06:09:17,870 --> 06:09:20,290
He missed.

5391
06:09:25,460 --> 06:09:26,570
He missed.

5392
06:09:31,880 --> 06:09:33,390
You fucking miss.

5393
06:09:36,070 --> 06:09:37,690
Okay, I have to use this.

5394
06:09:37,810 --> 06:09:38,670
I don't think we're winning.

5395
06:09:40,510 --> 06:09:42,750
I got concerned about not winning this fight.

5396
06:09:44,530 --> 06:09:45,670
Yeah, I had to use that.

5397
06:09:46,030 --> 06:09:47,330
Really didn't want to.

5398
06:09:47,790 --> 06:09:50,930
But it felt like we were absolutely not winning that.

5399
06:09:57,460 --> 06:10:01,820
Guys, Sarah, you're asking a DPS to swap off DPS.

5400
06:10:02,160 --> 06:10:05,100
Like I think you're asking a little too much.

5401
06:10:07,000 --> 06:10:12,100
You want a DPS to swap off of DPS, guys.

5402
06:10:13,040 --> 06:10:16,820
Like, bro, who do you think you are?

5403
06:10:22,520 --> 06:10:23,620
Oh, my God.

06:10:25,260 --> 06:10:26,100
Oh, my God.

5405
06:10:26,260 --> 06:10:26,660

5406
06:10:26,660 --> 06:10:27,340
I should have went.

5407
06:10:29,920 --> 06:10:31,400
We had to die there.

5408
06:10:32,360 --> 06:10:33,540
I should have went to pocket her.

5409
06:10:33,600 --> 06:10:35,040
I didn't know where the fuck she went.

5410
06:10:39,540 --> 06:10:48,040
yeah not only are you asking a dps to swap off to the tank

5411
06:10:48,040 --> 06:10:51,240

5419
06:12:08,580 --> 06:12:18,000
the way, our tank Has the most final hits Even if he missed,
our tank still had the most final hit.

5420
06:12:18,060 --> 06:12:19,320
Oh my god, I lost him.

5421
06:12:20,560 --> 06:12:20,860

Ooh.

5424

I don't know who else to avoid.

5425
06:12:31,630 --> 06:12:33,070
They were all pretty bad.

5426
06:12:33,330 --> 06:12:35,730
The thing is, I'm fucking it.

5427
06:12:36,850 --> 06:12:40,430
Yeah, the tank having the most final hits, that's pretty
embarrassing.

5428
06:12:40,750 --> 06:12:41,910
I'm not gonna lie.

5429
06:12:46,170 --> 06:12:47,110
It's okay.

5430
06:12:47,270 --> 06:12:49,310

Okay, wait.

I can still check his rank.

5442
06:14:03,430 --> 06:14:05,040
I don't want to unavoid him just because...

5443
06:14:06,730 --> 06:14:07,450
Okay, wait.

5444
06:14:08,050 --> 06:14:09,310

06:14:09,310 --> 06:14:10,990
Guys, did you see what his rank was?

5446
06:14:11,590 --> 06:14:12,570
I need to know.

5447
06:14:15,310 --> 06:14:16,150
Celestial 2?

5448
06:14:16,710 --> 06:14:17,470
There's no way.

5449
06:14:18,430 --> 06:14:19,530
There's no way.

5450
06:14:20,850 --> 06:14:22,770
Why does Guan Guan favor him?

5451
06:14:22,890 --> 06:14:25,490
a donors i've been a good person

5452
06:14:30,110 --> 06:14:39,290
i've been such a good person and yet guan guan decides to
favor him and give him like the actual decent games like i

5453
06:14:39,290 --> 06:14:53,370
don't understand what have i done wrong how could they do
this to me i mean not avoiding the spider-man because like

5454
06:14:55,370 --> 06:14:58,830
The thing is a good Spider-Man is actually very scary.

5455
06:14:59,370 --> 06:15:06,890
So, like, I don't know if, like, every time I avoid a
Spider-Man, they, like, and we don't have a DPS that can

5456
06:15:06,890 --> 06:15:08,010
counter Spider-Man.

5457
06:15:08,170 --> 06:15:10,510
Like, the Spider-Man ends up shitting on me.

5458
06:15:11,390 --> 06:15:15,650
But I know, because the Spider-Man, Spider-Man is, like, hit
or miss.

5459
06:15:15,730 --> 06:15:17,450
When they hit, they fucking hit.

5460
06:15:17,710 --> 06:15:19,770
When they miss, it's 18 to 18.

5461
06:15:19,790 --> 06:15:22,110
It's, like, it's like 5 kills and 18 deaths.

5462
06:15:22,310 --> 06:15:25,290
When they hit, it's, like, 50 kills and 4 deaths.

5463
06:15:25,310 --> 06:15:47,030
like so I'm not risking it at a yeah they return exactly if
I avoid a spider-man what if they fucking lock it in I don't

5464
06:15:47,030 --> 06:15:53,570
that's the risk I'm not gonna take I'm I'm not layering this
fucking Spider-Man lock-in.

5465
06:15:55,250 --> 06:15:57,790
If he's got lock-in, it better be on my fucking team.

5466
06:16:08,250 --> 06:16:10,710
Which hero do you think you want to be today?

5467
06:16:11,530 --> 06:16:11,930
Alright.

5468
06:16:21,700 --> 06:16:24,740
Surely we don't have a fourth support player, right?

5469
06:16:26,740 --> 06:16:29,840
Guys, we don't have a fourth support player, right?

5470
06:16:29,840 --> 06:16:32,180
And we have at least one more tank, right?

5471
06:16:32,460 --> 06:16:35,640
Surely we don't have five support players on this team.

5472
06:16:38,660 --> 06:16:44,160
That would be so fucking silly If that happens Right

5473
06:16:50,910 --> 06:17:01,410
That would be way too silly There's no way There's no way
the world decided to give me five support players The world

5474
06:17:01,410 --> 06:17:02,790
cannot be that cruel

5475
06:17:10,850 --> 06:17:15,350
Daredevil is so hard, man their double is just so fucking
hard to play against

5476
06:17:19,810 --> 06:17:34,460
all right let's see okay okay i got the spider-man player
that's okay he's gonna lock it in right here that's okay

5477
06:17:34,460 --> 06:17:44,200
this is where he locks in guys i did get up getting the
spider-man player but it's okay this is where he locks in

5478
06:17:44,200 --> 06:17:58,280
guys this is it so no no no this is the game he will lock in
because like because like the odds are like there's no way

5479
06:17:58,280 --> 06:18:06,300
you lose every spider-man game like how are you in my e-load
you end up losing my all spider-man games in the end like

5480
06:18:06,300 --> 06:18:12,400
you should be out of there like you shouldn't even be able
to play with me anymore so like I believe I am the game

5481
06:18:12,400 --> 06:18:21,720
where he still continues on in this Elo He only loses your
spider-man game surely this is the game where he wins,

5482
06:18:21,740 --> 06:18:22,280
right?

5483
06:18:28,200 --> 06:18:32,780
Like he has to win more than lose to be in this Elo, right?

5484
06:18:36,600 --> 06:18:44,300
Right that's how a statistic works area got it all right

5485
06:18:48,740 --> 06:19:05,640
things will oh oh oh whoa that's cool wait that's pretty
cool what just happened oh my god okay okay I just used it

5486
06:19:05,640 --> 06:19:10,420
up but like it was worth it because our gambit is still
alive now

5487
06:19:14,570 --> 06:19:14,970
Okay.

5488
06:19:19,810 --> 06:19:20,210

5489
06:19:22,630 --> 06:19:23,850

Because of the hella.

5495
06:19:34,910 --> 06:19:36,730
The hella confused me.

5496
06:19:39,610 --> 06:19:40,550
There's no way.

5497
06:19:40,930 --> 06:19:41,510

5507
06:20:41,410 --> 06:20:47,450

probably go a second.

5508
06:20:48,050 --> 06:20:53,610
I don't know how the fuck I accidentally copy the group I
don't know how that happened.

5509
06:20:53,810 --> 06:20:56,810
I even have double confirm and I was like that looks like a
group, right?

5510
06:20:59,250 --> 06:21:02,650
That looks like a group right there.

5511
06:21:03,730 --> 06:21:13,390
Oh my god, it really is the same guy Oh my god, he also
fucked up he also Okay, okay, okay, okay okay

5512
06:21:17,690 --> 06:21:24,670

Groot ulting there Because that was a very fast Groot Let's

5513
06:21:29,200 --> 06:21:34,160

Okay, I'm gonna not fuck up this copy this time I think I
think.

5516
06:21:55,370 --> 06:22:01,450
I'll try and grab the fellow's attention, but y'all need to
take care of.

5517
06:22:01,650 --> 06:22:03,230
Despite that, they don't have a DPS.

5518
06:22:15,710 --> 06:22:16,270
Okay.

5519
06:22:18,230 --> 06:22:20,530
All right, we mirrored, we mirrored.

5520
06:22:20,650 --> 06:22:21,610
That should be fine, right?

5521
06:22:23,290 --> 06:22:23,870
There we go.

5522
06:22:27,750 --> 06:22:28,810
All right, we mirrored.

5523
06:22:29,090 --> 06:22:29,430
That's fine.

5524
06:22:37,700 --> 06:22:39,600

Goodbye, Jeff.

5594
06:29:52,070 --> 06:29:53,530
Why did you just stay there?

5595
06:29:55,030 --> 06:29:57,270
Oh, my.

5596
06:29:57,590 --> 06:29:59,610
Just use your old spurt.

5597
06:30:04,850 --> 06:30:05,530
Okay.

5598
06:30:06,430 --> 06:30:15,910
So, what we learned today was I think Gwangwan just really
hates me right now.

5599
06:30:16,270 --> 06:30:17,650
I don't know what I did wrong.

5600
06:30:17,750 --> 06:30:22,690
Maybe because of Elo-Terrorized way too long.

5601
06:30:23,130 --> 06:30:28,630
That now the game decided you've been Elo-Terrorizing for so
long.

5602
06:30:28,870 --> 06:30:31,350
It's your turn to get Elo-Terrorized.

5603
06:30:32,050 --> 06:30:34,830
All right, no, I'll avoid the Spider-Man.

5604
06:30:34,950 --> 06:30:35,910
No, I think it's time.

5605
06:30:35,990 --> 06:30:39,490
I think he has proven himself to be not one of the good
ones.

5606
06:30:41,950 --> 06:30:44,310
He is definitely not one of the good Spider-Man.

5607
06:30:45,090 --> 06:30:45,570
How?

5608
06:30:46,670 --> 06:30:47,150
How?

5609
06:30:49,450 --> 06:30:51,710
He has a fucking okay.

5610
06:30:52,850 --> 06:30:52,850
Okay.

5611
06:30:53,350 --> 06:30:53,350
Okay.

5612
06:30:54,830 --> 06:30:55,490
Okay.

5613
06:30:56,610 --> 06:30:56,790
Okay.

5614
06:30:57,290 --> 06:30:58,630
Why couldn't this be me?

5615
06:30:59,270 --> 06:31:00,250
I don't understand.

5616
06:31:01,450 --> 06:31:02,750
Why couldn't this be me?

5617
06:31:03,170 --> 06:31:04,550
Why couldn't this be me?

5618
06:31:04,970 --> 06:31:05,710
Oh wait, that was me.

5619
06:31:07,010 --> 06:31:07,670
That...

5620
06:31:07,670 --> 06:31:08,750
Yay.

5621
06:31:09,010 --> 06:31:09,590
Wait, never mind.

5622
06:31:09,990 --> 06:31:11,470
That one was me.

5623
06:31:11,890 --> 06:31:14,770
That one was me.

5624
06:31:15,170 --> 06:31:17,550
But like, why could this also be me?

5625
06:31:20,870 --> 06:31:25,910

5642
06:34:31,830 --> 06:34:38,070
life has been very cruel to me Life for some reason has been
very cruel.

5643
06:34:46,980 --> 06:34:49,520
You'll need a top-notch team to win this one.

5644
06:34:51,560 --> 06:34:51,880
Alright.

5645
06:34:53,940 --> 06:34:55,460

5646
06:34:56,000 --> 06:34:57,180
I deserve this game.

5647
06:34:58,940 --> 06:34:59,540
I don't know.

5648
06:34:59,740 --> 06:35:00,500
Like, where do I...

5649
06:35:00,500 --> 06:35:01,900

06:35:02,020 --> 06:35:02,520
Fuck it.

5651
06:35:03,580 --> 06:35:05,560
I deserve a rocket game.

5652
06:35:07,380 --> 06:35:07,740
Oh, wait.

5653
06:35:07,760 --> 06:35:08,580
Jeff is still open.

5654
06:35:08,660 --> 06:35:09,080
Oh, my gosh.

5655
06:35:09,140 --> 06:35:10,380
I fucking zoned out.

5656
06:35:11,000 --> 06:35:11,540
It's okay.

5657
06:35:11,620 --> 06:35:12,720
We have Bucky and Matt.

5658
06:35:15,620 --> 06:35:20,700
We have Bucky at mag things will be okay

5659
06:35:25,790 --> 06:35:41,210
Okay, and we have star alert look at that things will be
five I believe I will not play Jeff I I will not play Jeff

5660
06:35:41,210 --> 06:35:41,610
right now.

5661
06:35:41,630 --> 06:35:43,690
I'm not in the right mindset anymore.

5662
06:35:43,930 --> 06:35:51,610
I'm not and definitely not in the right mindset The blade

06:36:06,280 --> 06:36:10,100
If they have mag I'm fucked I'm not trusting on that

5666
06:36:13,930 --> 06:36:21,470
Literally just Jesus Christ Oh my god I guess I'll just be

5667
06:36:26,670 --> 06:36:27,270
Oh my god.

5668
06:36:27,450 --> 06:36:27,810
Okay, it's fine.

5669
06:36:28,010 --> 06:36:28,210
It's fine.

5670
06:36:32,060 --> 06:36:32,800
It's okay.

5671
06:36:32,880 --> 06:36:33,740
It's okay, guys.

5672
06:36:33,840 --> 06:36:36,120
They're not running triple support, so it's okay.

5673
06:36:38,360 --> 06:36:39,000
It's okay.

5674
06:36:39,100 --> 06:36:41,360
They're not running triple support, so it should be fine.

5675
06:36:44,480 --> 06:36:45,080
It's okay.

5676
06:36:45,220 --> 06:36:45,940
They're still not running.

5677
06:36:46,020 --> 06:36:46,920
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

5678
06:36:47,920 --> 06:36:48,460
Whoa, whoa.

We're holding the fort.

5688
06:37:31,320 --> 06:37:31,980
We're holding the fort.

5689
06:37:33,280 --> 06:37:34,100
We've held the fort.

5690
06:37:37,280 --> 06:37:38,860
I told you we'll hold the fort.

5691
06:37:42,380 --> 06:37:43,740
Wait, we'll put it here again.

5692
06:37:44,420 --> 06:37:45,280
I don't think they know.

5693
06:37:45,720 --> 06:37:46,220
What are you gonna do?

5694
06:37:46,260 --> 06:37:46,980
Go hog around?

5695
06:37:47,180 --> 06:37:48,160
Fucking crazy.

5696
06:37:48,960 --> 06:37:49,680
I leave.

5697
06:37:52,560 --> 06:37:52,800
Oh my god.

5698
06:37:53,580 --> 06:37:54,300
There we go.

5699
06:37:54,460 --> 06:37:55,520
See, I told you.

5700
06:37:55,600 --> 06:37:56,900
They're not gonna go high ground.

5701
06:37:57,460 --> 06:37:58,120
Look at that.

5702
06:38:01,760 --> 06:38:02,060
Alright.

5703
06:38:02,820 --> 06:38:03,780
Everything is fine.

5704
06:38:05,640 --> 06:38:07,280
Everything is so fine.

5705
06:38:09,600 --> 06:38:10,200
Alright.

5706
06:38:10,740 --> 06:38:11,320
Watch.

5707
06:38:12,400 --> 06:38:16,580
Okay, I'm worried that when I say watch this, my entire team
will die.

5708
06:38:16,940 --> 06:38:19,600
So for now, we're gonna chill a little bit.

5709
06:38:20,340 --> 06:38:22,480
We're gonna chill a little bit.

5710
06:38:22,960 --> 06:38:23,640
And then...

5711
06:38:25,880 --> 06:38:27,880
This is real firepower!

5712
06:38:28,040 --> 06:38:28,840
Let's go!

5713
06:38:30,920 --> 06:38:31,160
Oh!

5714
06:38:32,140 --> 06:38:33,120
Ooh, okay.

5715
06:38:34,020 --> 06:38:34,240
Whoa!

5716
06:38:35,440 --> 06:38:36,380
Look at that!

5717
06:38:36,540 --> 06:38:38,120
I don't know...

5718
06:38:38,120 --> 06:38:39,180
Okay, I...

5719
06:38:40,620 --> 06:38:42,260
Oh, it's okay, it's okay.

5720
06:38:42,340 --> 06:38:43,680
Everyone gets bubbled, you know?

5721
06:38:44,080 --> 06:38:45,340
It happens, it happens.

5722
06:38:45,680 --> 06:38:46,280
It happens.

5723
06:38:48,480 --> 06:38:50,520
Sometimes people just get bubbled.

5724
06:38:50,960 --> 06:38:51,900
It just happens.

5725
06:38:52,100 --> 06:38:53,600
Oh my god, okay.

5726
06:38:54,020 --> 06:38:54,780
Guys, don't worry.

5727
06:38:55,360 --> 06:38:57,980
They don't expect me in high ground.

5728
06:38:58,160 --> 06:38:59,860
They never expect the high ground.

5729
06:39:01,200 --> 06:39:05,000
Okay, Star Lord, I hope you live because I do not have any
more.

5730
06:39:05,540 --> 06:39:06,160
Oh my god.

5731
06:39:06,860 --> 06:39:09,340
Oh my god, please do not touch me.

5732
06:39:09,800 --> 06:39:11,020
Oh my god.

5733
06:39:11,720 --> 06:39:12,080
There you go.

5734
06:39:12,180 --> 06:39:12,520
There you go.

5735
06:39:12,560 --> 06:39:12,760
See?

5736
06:39:13,600 --> 06:39:15,920
No one ever expects a rat on high ground.

5737
06:39:17,240 --> 06:39:17,980
Watch this again.

5738
06:39:19,020 --> 06:39:21,280
No one still expects a rat on high ground.

5739
06:39:21,880 --> 06:39:22,260
Look at that.

5740
06:39:22,300 --> 06:39:23,760
They're like, where's the beacon?

5741
06:39:24,020 --> 06:39:26,900
Surely it's not on high ground again.

5742
06:39:26,940 --> 06:39:27,180
True.

5743
06:39:29,060 --> 06:39:29,880
It's surely.

5744
06:39:30,520 --> 06:39:31,420
Oh my, it's okay.

5745
06:39:31,620 --> 06:39:31,820
It's okay.

5746
06:39:31,940 --> 06:39:32,700
I can heal myself.

5747
06:39:32,840 --> 06:39:34,120
You don't have to worry about me.

5748
06:39:34,520 --> 06:39:36,240
You don't have to worry about me.

5749
06:39:37,260 --> 06:39:37,620
It's okay.

5750
06:39:37,700 --> 06:39:39,280
I can fend for myself.

5751
06:39:41,060 --> 06:39:41,340
Look at that.

5752
06:39:42,640 --> 06:39:43,140
Look at that.

5753
06:39:43,920 --> 06:39:44,740
I told you.

5754
06:39:45,260 --> 06:39:47,040
I'm gonna wait a little bit.

5755
06:39:49,700 --> 06:39:50,320
I'm gonna wait.

5756
06:39:51,180 --> 06:39:52,140
All right, all right.

5757
06:39:52,280 --> 06:39:52,660
All right.

5758
06:39:54,400 --> 06:39:56,220
We can kill him, right?

5759
06:39:59,100 --> 06:39:59,200
Okay.

5760
06:40:00,160 --> 06:40:02,520
Here we go.

5761
06:40:03,260 --> 06:40:03,640
I believe.

5762
06:40:04,000 --> 06:40:04,400
What did he got?

5763
06:40:04,560 --> 06:40:06,500
Oh, I still believe.

5764
06:40:06,980 --> 06:40:07,540
He just...

5765
06:40:08,360 --> 06:40:08,700
Okay.

5766
06:40:09,020 --> 06:40:09,620
He...

5767
06:40:10,440 --> 06:40:10,740
Oh!

5768
06:40:11,920 --> 06:40:12,520
Oh!

5769
06:40:13,060 --> 06:40:13,660
Oh!

5770
06:40:15,680 --> 06:40:16,800
Okay, I might have...

5771
06:40:16,800 --> 06:40:17,640
I should have altered earlier.

5772
06:40:17,740 --> 06:40:18,540
I should have altered earlier.

5773
06:40:18,740 --> 06:40:19,820
I thought...

5774
06:40:19,820 --> 06:40:21,940
I thought it was salvageable.

5775
06:40:23,040 --> 06:40:24,000
It was...

5776
06:40:24,020 --> 06:40:35,220
absolutely not salvageable i thought i thought i could save
them i really did i really did thought i could save them

5777
06:40:37,660 --> 06:40:48,020
okay it's okay it's okay it's okay it's okay it's okay it's
okay it's okay you might be getting close but don't i need

5778
06:40:48,020 --> 06:40:55,960
you to know i tried so hard to heal you i really did i i
never I never stopped holding right click.

5779
06:40:56,280 --> 06:40:58,480
Like, there was nothing else I could do for this team.

5780
06:40:59,240 --> 06:40:59,980
Here we go.

5781
06:41:00,860 --> 06:41:03,560
This is real firepower.

5782
06:41:04,340 --> 06:41:07,860
Oh my god.

5783
06:41:08,420 --> 06:41:10,860
Oh, my god.

5784
06:41:11,760 --> 06:41:12,180
Oh.

5785
06:41:12,580 --> 06:41:14,160
Alright, so.

5786
06:41:15,240 --> 06:41:16,560
I should have altered earlier.

5787
06:41:18,740 --> 06:41:21,520
I did not think that...

5788
06:41:22,960 --> 06:41:24,000
That was going to have.

5789
06:41:24,020 --> 06:41:24,460
happen.

5790
06:41:25,460 --> 06:41:26,580
I stopped feeling.

5791
06:41:26,720 --> 06:41:26,980
You're right.

5792
06:41:27,060 --> 06:41:28,180
That was my biggest mistake.

5793
06:41:29,000 --> 06:41:29,760
I stopped feeling.

5794
06:41:30,100 --> 06:41:31,360
Okay, we're not putting that there.

5795
06:41:31,580 --> 06:41:36,080
We're gonna put... I thought I would hit the middle and it
would be like, oh, they're not gonna hit that.

5796
06:41:36,200 --> 06:41:38,020
It's in the middle, but...

5797
06:41:38,020 --> 06:41:38,020
Whoops.

5798
06:41:39,640 --> 06:41:40,100
Don't worry.

5799
06:41:40,180 --> 06:41:40,680
Don't worry.

5800
06:41:41,580 --> 06:41:41,980
Boom!

5801
06:41:42,400 --> 06:41:43,720
They're not gonna find this, Rez.

5802
06:41:46,780 --> 06:41:47,200
Oh.

5803
06:41:48,840 --> 06:41:49,260
Let's...

5804
06:41:49,260 --> 06:41:49,820
Let's hope he hits.

5805
06:41:50,000 --> 06:41:50,980
He did not hit that.

5806
06:41:52,140 --> 06:41:52,560
Um...

5807
06:41:54,020 --> 06:41:55,580
Oh, okay, let's...

5808
06:41:55,580 --> 06:41:56,600
Don't worry, they don't see the rest.

5809
06:41:56,700 --> 06:41:57,440
You see that one beacon?

5810
06:41:57,600 --> 06:41:58,780
They all ran past it.

5811
06:41:59,900 --> 06:42:01,760
They're all actually running past it.

5812
06:42:02,080 --> 06:42:03,460
They actually don't see it.

5813
06:42:04,100 --> 06:42:04,860
Oh, thank God.

5814
06:42:05,440 --> 06:42:06,320
They don't see it.

5815
06:42:06,580 --> 06:42:07,480
That's the best part.

5816
06:42:08,600 --> 06:42:09,700
They don't know.

5817
06:42:13,940 --> 06:42:14,980
I don't...

5818
06:42:17,780 --> 06:42:19,060
That's very unlucky.

5819
06:42:22,240 --> 06:42:23,140
Oh, my God.

5820
06:42:23,300 --> 06:42:23,820
That's so unlucky.

5821
06:42:24,840 --> 06:42:25,480
That's so...

5822
06:42:25,480 --> 06:42:26,040
Oh, my.

5823
06:42:26,060 --> 06:42:27,220
I got it.

5824
06:42:28,420 --> 06:42:29,540
I'm just...

5825
06:42:29,540 --> 06:42:32,240
Oh my god, he's taking forever to kill me too.

5826
06:42:34,200 --> 06:42:36,020
Wait, they went triple support?

5827
06:42:36,400 --> 06:42:38,480
Okay, I am gonna swap.

5828
06:42:40,200 --> 06:42:41,780
I'm gonna swap after this.

5829
06:42:44,440 --> 06:42:46,600
I didn't even realize they went triple.

5830
06:42:48,640 --> 06:42:49,760
Fucking nerds.

5831
06:42:50,140 --> 06:42:50,880
Fucking course.

5832
06:42:51,000 --> 06:42:52,580
If all else fails, go triple support.

5833
06:42:53,080 --> 06:42:53,460
Always.

5834
06:42:54,700 --> 06:42:55,720
God damn it.

5835
06:42:57,260 --> 06:42:58,620
Fucking always.

5836
06:43:02,060 --> 06:43:04,400
Please don't let them shoot it.

5837
06:43:04,720 --> 06:43:07,100
Please protect our precious rock it up.

Last minute.

5877
06:45:31,280 --> 06:45:31,880
Last minute.

5878
06:45:33,780 --> 06:45:35,760
I was right there.

5879
06:45:36,300 --> 06:45:37,400
We got the end pump.

5880
06:45:38,420 --> 06:45:39,740
I just turned around.

5881
06:45:41,020 --> 06:45:41,720
There we go.

5882
06:45:45,480 --> 06:45:46,240
Oh my god, please.

5883
06:45:49,400 --> 06:45:50,940
Oh my god.

5884
06:45:54,880 --> 06:45:55,560
Please.

5885
06:45:59,310 --> 06:46:00,670
Oh no.

5886
06:46:02,030 --> 06:46:04,530
No, no, no, it's the cop.

5887
06:46:07,920 --> 06:46:09,740
Literally just needed a copy.

5888
06:46:16,410 --> 06:46:16,650
Okay.

5889
06:46:18,870 --> 06:46:24,530
This is very unfortunate because we didn't get, bro.

5890
06:46:25,630 --> 06:46:27,130
We didn't get a lot of kills.

5891
06:46:28,710 --> 06:46:32,290
Time to switch things up, including which side you're on.

5892
06:46:34,210 --> 06:46:35,130
Oh my god.

5893
06:46:35,810 --> 06:46:38,070
I'm just gonna go low key at this point.

5894
06:46:38,310 --> 06:46:40,750
I think we need the low key for the.

5895
06:46:43,430 --> 06:46:51,490
Yeah, yo, the stat line is not ideal.

5896
06:46:54,290 --> 06:47:01,070
I will say, the stat line is very sad to look at.

5897
06:47:07,950 --> 06:47:12,230
I felt like I did not see a GPS at all.

5898
06:47:13,330 --> 06:47:15,770
I really did not see it.

5899
06:47:15,790 --> 06:47:28,410
DPS stuff 30 seconds before you attack get ready Bucky ulted
but he was more like most like he was like sort of ulting

5900
06:47:28,410 --> 06:47:36,030
air It was like when I was playing Jeff that's how that's
how I felt watching that Bucky

5901
06:47:47,500 --> 06:47:55,260
And then I don't know what our other DPS was that's how
little of an impact I felt Like, I don't even remember.

5902
06:47:55,340 --> 06:47:56,540
I remember he was on Starlord.

5903
06:47:56,680 --> 06:47:58,080
What the fuck was he after that?

5904
06:47:58,740 --> 06:48:01,020
Like, what did he play after Starlord?

5905
06:48:08,960 --> 06:48:10,180
Oh my god.

5906
06:48:12,500 --> 06:48:13,220
Wait, they went.

5907
06:48:17,530 --> 06:48:18,570
Oh my god, please.

5908
06:48:18,850 --> 06:48:19,450
I am on.

5909
06:48:21,210 --> 06:48:22,370
Please, I am on.

5910
06:48:22,750 --> 06:48:23,910
I am on Loki.

5911
06:48:25,370 --> 06:48:26,770
Please, I am on low-key.

5912
06:48:28,810 --> 06:48:31,490
Like, this is very hard to aim in general.

5913
06:48:34,890 --> 06:48:35,550
Oh my god, please.

5914
06:48:37,970 --> 06:48:40,210
Please, oh!

5915
06:48:46,550 --> 06:48:47,070
Nice.

5916

Okay, that's good.

5917
06:48:53,610 --> 06:48:54,130
Alright.

5918
06:48:55,470 --> 06:48:56,350
We broke it.

5919
06:48:56,430 --> 06:48:57,170
We broke it.

5920
06:48:57,650 --> 06:48:58,790
I used Involve.

5921
06:48:58,890 --> 06:49:01,690

5922
06:49:01,910 --> 06:49:02,010

Yeah, no.

5944

5945
06:50:38,420 --> 06:50:40,180

There is hope in this world because we're triple.

Okay, Loki.

5963
06:52:18,950 --> 06:52:19,430
Here we go.

5964
06:52:20,090 --> 06:52:20,690
There we go.

5965
06:52:21,750 --> 06:52:22,790
It's the win condition.

5966
06:52:24,370 --> 06:52:25,770
It truly is the win condition.

5967
06:52:31,270 --> 06:52:32,430

Okay, it's fine.

5970
06:52:53,090 --> 06:52:53,990
I'm scared.

5971
06:52:54,610 --> 06:52:55,890
I didn't want to get lay.

5972
06:52:56,810 --> 06:52:58,950
I had to use that because I got scared.

5973
06:52:59,930 --> 06:53:02,410
I got scared of fucking getting...

5974
06:53:05,730 --> 06:53:07,050
I got really scared.

5975
06:53:08,010 --> 06:53:09,630
I know I shouldn't have used it.

5976
06:53:09,970 --> 06:53:11,370
Oh my god, he's so...

5977
06:53:11,370 --> 06:53:12,650
He's alive!

5978
06:53:16,090 --> 06:53:19,750
I didn't want to use it, but like, he was gonna eat me
anyway.

5979
06:53:20,110 --> 06:53:21,130
I didn't want to waste it.

5980
06:53:28,810 --> 06:53:30,150
Oh my god.

5981
06:53:30,910 --> 06:53:32,630
Okay, I'm gonna try not to waste the next 12.

5982
06:53:34,070 --> 06:53:38,630
It sucked because, like, I hate trying to predict coffees.

5983
06:53:39,250 --> 06:53:42,410
It's so hard to predict for defensive up.

5984
06:53:44,090 --> 06:53:44,330
Alright.

5985
06:53:48,810 --> 06:53:49,470
It's okay.

5986
06:53:50,510 --> 06:53:51,410
It's not okay.

5987
06:53:52,750 --> 06:53:53,810
It's not okay.

5988
06:53:53,910 --> 06:53:54,830
I have to reload

5989
06:53:59,370 --> 06:54:05,430
It's okay guys What the fuck is going okay?

06:56:10,700 --> 06:56:11,220
supports.

6017

I don't care anymore.

6018
06:56:13,160 --> 06:56:16,840
I really don't think I can keep on going in this game.

6019
06:56:17,400 --> 06:56:23,780
I don't know how much longer I have in me, but triple
support, I don't know how much longer.

6020
06:56:24,320 --> 06:56:32,200
I don't know how much I have left in me.

6021
06:56:35,340 --> 06:56:36,340

That was nearly everything.

6047
06:58:54,250 --> 06:58:54,410
Okay.

6048
06:58:54,590 --> 06:58:55,230
We have res.

06:58:55,350 --> 06:58:57,410
We have res for the last fight.

6050
06:58:58,470 --> 06:59:03,390
They used so many else there.

6051
06:59:04,370 --> 06:59:05,910
That was very scary.

6052
06:59:08,770 --> 06:59:10,210
I was just like, okay.

6053
06:59:11,090 --> 06:59:11,810

that's actually crazy that's

6060
07:00:30,440 --> 07:00:36,360
of course the building constructs itself the moment that
happens

6061
07:00:43,230 --> 07:00:44,170
I don't know.

6062
07:00:44,410 --> 07:00:46,430
I'm just gonna go rocket for the res.

6063
07:00:49,590 --> 07:00:51,390
I just can't have anything.

6064
07:00:52,790 --> 07:00:55,590
Like, it's not allowed to have anything in this game.

6065
07:00:59,350 --> 07:01:00,790
I don't know.

6066
07:01:01,030 --> 07:01:02,970
Do I go rocket or Loki?

6067
07:01:03,390 --> 07:01:04,170
I can't tell.

6068
07:01:04,830 --> 07:01:08,750
I feel like Loki just for the amount of heals that I output.

6069
07:01:11,330 --> 07:01:12,770
Yeah, but I also played Loki during...

6070
07:01:13,930 --> 07:01:14,490
Attack.

6071
07:01:22,910 --> 07:01:25,690
Yeah, but I don't know if I should just swap rocket during
overtime.

I still can't believe that happened to me.

6075
07:01:38,560 --> 07:01:40,760
That is actually so unlucky.

6076
07:01:41,580 --> 07:01:44,120

Also, most likely I won't raid anyone.

6160
07:10:37,990 --> 07:10:40,530
I'm just gonna fucking free you guys into the spear.

6161

6164
07:10:53,650 --> 07:10:55,570
