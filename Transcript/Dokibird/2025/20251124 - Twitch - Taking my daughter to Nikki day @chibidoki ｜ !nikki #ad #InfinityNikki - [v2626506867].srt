27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,900
playing infinity Nikki let's go we're going to be reacting
to a video about I was like well much plan changed plans

28
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:21,660

my kid she's she's allowed to make mistakes she's a child

29
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:30,180
yeah I'm sorry you they grow up to be Chibi Doki it's crazy
so we are going to be checking out infinity Nikki today you

30
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:38,720
so much for sponsoring the both of us to do a little uh
reaction time to the newest update for their anniversary um

31
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:44,820
and i think like the last 10 minutes we're going to be
looking through some outfits that are going to be launched

32
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:53,400
with the anniversary as well and apparently it's a very very
big change have you played infinity nikki yet i played what

33
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:59,200
one of the nikki games on mobile a long time ago because i
was really into like fashion games as a kid yeah yeah and

34
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,200
When this game came out, I was actually really excited.

35
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,460
I played it for a couple hours when it first came out.

36
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,400
Yeah, this is actually my first time playing Niki.

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,600
So, which is, I guess, good because they're changing a lot
for the newest update.

38
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,140
So they're making it open world now.

39
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,520
So I assume it's a lot different from when you played it,
right?

40
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,020
Because it was more about like fashion and configuring
outfits and stuff.

41
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,600
More linear, yeah.

42
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,060
And like, this is going to be more like explorative and
it'll be really fun, I think.

43
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:35,860
yeah yeah so yeah they apparently it's like a whole they
were saying that it's a whole new thing um like what you

44
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:42,600
played before is going to be very different from what it is
now or like the newest update and it doesn't feel like it's

45
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:49,120
a new patch basically it's like entirely new game because
they added the whole open world concept to it yeah so that's

46
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:56,440
so cool chibi and i we were trying to do the tutorial for
for the game and then um there was a lot of lore because

47
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:04,440
like the lore was how there's a whale yeah there's a whale
in space and you're like reborn into something also we

48
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:11,180
danced with a beautiful girl that was my favorite part yeah
she was that's what she was doing that's what she was doing

49
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:19,200
while like she was in the chat just going through the
tutorial and stuff um and uh so yeah there's gonna be a lot

50
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:27,200

Oh.

94
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,660

95
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:19,380
Oh.

96
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:19,960
Oh.

00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,340
There's the light.

98
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,120
I'm watching it through my through my OBS.

99
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,060
Oh, yeah.

100
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,000
Me too, yeah.

101
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:36,980
Pretty.

102
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,960
I'd love to see the art book for this game.

103
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:41,680
I know.

104
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,800
Like the fashion, all the fashion outfits that you can do.

105
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:51,020
It's the last 10 minutes of the of the stream.

106
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,800
We're going to be looking through the new outfits that
they're going to be showcasing for the new anniversary.

107
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:56,420
I love cute clothes.

108
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:57,940
Me too.

109
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,320
Like, I like seeing fashion.

110
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,040
I just don't like wearing it because, like, it takes no fair
enough.

111
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:03,560
Yeah.

112
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:09,180
It takes so much time to, like, you know, get prepared to go
out.

113
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,660
And then, like, if you wear a cute outfit, that means you
have to make your hair cute and then your face cute.

114
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,780
And it's like, I'm not.

115
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,060
That's why we're V-Tubers.

116
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:16,680
Yeah, exactly.

117
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,500
We don't have to do any of that.

118
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,180
You might do that every street.

119
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,600
That's a bit too much.

120
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,220
Yeah, you gotta touch grass and we have to dress up as well.

121
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,220
Like pick one.

122
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,380
I know.

123
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,280
I like, I am showering three days.

124
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:38,920
Yeah, okay.

125
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,100
Not like her though.

126
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,100
That's- Oh, what?

127
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:41,700
Oh, me neither.

128
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,460
I was just kidding.

129
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,940
Like, that's from her mom's side, not from me.

130
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,820
Oh, she's emoting.

131
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,740
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

132
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,200
Wait, I think my dog just started whining.

133
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,700
No, I think that's just from... That's just you.

134
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,540
Are you sure?

135
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:01,940
I don't know.

136
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,500
Wait, she swapped outfits.

137
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,300
Slay.

138
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,780
Wait, where did the dragon come from?

139
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,520
Wait, are we going to...

140
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,800
Are we going to dress up the dragon?

141
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,100
Are we going to get the dragon a cute outfit too?

142
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,040
We're trying to save the dragon.

143
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,560
Save the dragon from his horrible fashion sense.

144
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,100
Oh, no!

145
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,520
Or maybe we're harvesting him for material to make pieces.

146
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:20,700
Oh, you're right.

147
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,460
It's like 101 donations.

148
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,420
Yeah, we're going to wear scales.

00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:22,800
Now, as I'm sure all of you noticed, the two of us made the
effort to dress up for today's live stream.

166
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:29,440
Styling ourselves in a look inspired by Itzalan, a brand new
region that stylists can explore.

167
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,220
We also styled ourselves.

168
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,240
Yeah.

169
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,740
I put cheese on my head.

170
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,060
Hey, Johnny.

171
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,340
What do you think of the outfit I put together for today's
live stream?

172
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,100
I tried to give it a little bit of Itzalan vibe.

173
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,440
You know, I think you look amazing.

174
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,320
This look really fits you and it perfectly matches the vibe
of version 2.0.

175
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,640
I did try my best.

176
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:54,360
It's hard to believe, but it's almost been a full universe
of Infinity Niki launched.

177
00:10:54,760 --> 00:11:00,780
Over the past year, Niki and Momo have traveled through
Flora Wish, Rizzie Meadow, Stoneville, and Wishing Woods,

178
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,880
making new friends and creating so many wonderful memories
along the way.

179
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:11,920
In version 2.0, Niki and Momo will be leaving the familiar
lands of Wishfield and beginning a brand new journey from

180
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,520
this time to the destination is its land.

181
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,200
I like Momo.

182
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,840
Oh, so they added like a whole new area.

183
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:17,760
earlier.

184
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,840
It actually contained a lot of top secret information.

185
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:30,540
For example, those ancient murals, the mysterious ritual,
that massive shadowy figure, and that curious mark appearing

186
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,180
on the back of Nikki's neck.

187
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,860
They all feel like they're hinting at a hidden truth of
sorts.

188
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,640
I can't take it anymore.

189
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,220

Wow, version 2.0 is so different.

204
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,800
It really, really is.

205
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:47,320
Let me ask you what really stuck out to you that was
different from version 1.0.

206
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,340
Yeah, GBU.

207
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,020
What is different?

208
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,840
What is different?

209
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,140
I barely played it.

210
00:12:54,580 --> 00:13:00,420
I know it's more open world and more focused on adventuring
and- Oh, I heard it's combat now too.

211
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,200
Yes, I- Dude, there's like classes and weapon- It's so cool.

212
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,280
Yeah, I saw there's like archery, which is like shooting a
gun.

213
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,040
But medieval- You're good at that.

214
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:09,800
Yeah, yeah.

215
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:15,340
We'll pin the winner list in the comments and share it on
our official social media later.

216
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,200

Also, don't forget to check after the stream to see if
you're one of our lucky winners.

218
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:26,040

219
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,120
Might win $50.

220
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,020
That's awesome.

221
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:36,300
Because right now, we're going to find out exactly what kind
of brand new adventure Nikki and Momo are about to embark

222
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:36,580
on.

223
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:42,460
That's right, stylist, it's time to reveal the PV for
version 2.0.

224
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:43,760
Yay!

225
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,540
That's where I have psoriasis.

226
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,560
You're, what?

227
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:50,620
Sorry.

228
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,300
She got her glowing mark.

229
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,580
That's where I have psoriasis.

230
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,000
I feel like her right now.

231
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,260
That's how I got it, actually.

232
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,520
It just started glowing.

233
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,780
Oh, there's the archer.

234
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:04,880
There's the archery.

235
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:05,520
That is so...

236
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,320
In video games, I always like to go for archer.

237
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,700
That is so cool.

238
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,080
Oh, yeah, because it's like long range, too.

239
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,580
Oh, wait.

240
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,580
It's so pretty.

241
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,240
Oh my god, there's...

242
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,720
See, I knew he was wearing a diaper.

243
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,040
Yeah, see, I told you.

244
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,320
Does he have a problem?

245
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:20,920
Like, IBS?

246
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,380
I don't know.

247
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,920
You seem to know a lot about these problems.

248
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,980
Are you talking from experience?

249
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,000
Are you talking from experience?

250
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,660
Listen, man.

251
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,740
We don't need to talk about the diaper.

252
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,240
I'm wearing it, man.

253
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,420
I understand.

254
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,240
It was awesome.

255
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,460
Look, there he is.

256
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,080
I knew he was a baby or an adult.

257
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,860
We don't know.

258
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,360
Oh, that's a cute outfit, though.

259
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,680
Oh, my God.

260
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,900
That's a John-ass...

261
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,720
How is he able to lift himself?

262
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,000
Oh, my gosh.

263
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:01,880
Tokyo Drifting.

264
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,400
Play the Eurobeat.

265
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,400
Gosh, these snails...

266
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:04,780
Oh, my God.

267
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,980
These snails are so fast.

268
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,800
Did you ever play snail mail on the phone?

269
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,520
Snail mail?

270
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,960
Yeah, it was a mobile game.

271
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,880
Where your snail delivered mail to other planet.

272
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,060
When did that came out?

273
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,160
I was, like, 10 years old.

274
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,900
Oh, yeah, okay, but, like, what year?

275
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,000
So, like, I don't know, like, 2008?

276
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,260
Oh, I like that guy's mourns.

277
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,420
Okay, but who plays the guy in this game, though?

278
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,500
You gotta slay as a cute girl.

279
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,640
Yeah, always a cute girl.

280
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,620
I will not be able to come with the mushroom gun.

281
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,160
Yeah, like, who invented Who invited this guy?

282
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:47,820
He thinks he's part of the tea.

283
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,100
I know, I think Bro thinks he's part of the tea.

284
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:49,280
Yeah,

285
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,220
I'd rather be the muster.

286
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:53,680
You're right.

287
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,920
No, I won't be the muster.

288
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,340
I mean, he is slaying, though.

289
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,360
Yeah, I've been looking at him.

290
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:58,860
He's really good.

291
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,180
Oh, my God.

292
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:03,960
That's the combat.

293
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,580
We have to fight that guy.

294
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,420
My sick-ass outfit.

295
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,040
Weaponize these heels.

296
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,520
Oh, Oh!

297
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,000
That's cute.

298
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,610
To see the truth.

299
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:27,770
Even if it upends everything we once firmly believed.

300
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,810
2.0 is coming, guys!

301
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,030
Yay!

302
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:32,490
Oh, yeah!

303
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:33,450
Oh, cool!

304
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,190
Oh, that has to be the archery stuff.

305
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,400
I feel like every part of this game could be like a really
pretty background.

306
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:45,380
Yeah.

307
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,280
I mean, oh my gosh.

308
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,380
Oh, the lion.

309
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:48,880
The title.

310
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:49,440
Is that the dragon?

311
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:49,880
Is that the dragon?

312
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,960
Yeah, I was gonna say the lion.

313
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,880
Well, he has lion down.

314
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,260
Bro, look at that giant-ass lion over there.

315
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,320
This is actually really beautiful.

316
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,120
I want to go there.

317
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:08,000
Like, apparently, the fact that they made, like, an entirely
new game out of the concept.

318
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:09,140
Yeah.

319
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:16,060
Because they were willing to, like, because they were, like,
trying to fix what a lot of users had issues with earlier.

320
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:16,740
Yeah.

321
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,040
And just giving a whole other new experience.

322
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:25,240
That's weird to, like, try and make things better like not
just like little changes but really big changes for the

323
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:31,460
enjoyment of the players that's like games rarely do that
nowadays oh also i just saw that you saw the outfits have

340
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,980
25th, UTC7.

341
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,260
Hey, Johnny, I'm sure everyone feels the same way I do.

342
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,560
After watching the PV, I've got so many questions.

343
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:19,060
The brand new five-star resonance outfits, Niki wielding a
bow, new abilities, trials, and challenges.

344
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,700
Is this still the Infinity Niki we know and love?

345
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:28,580
Not to worry, we'll be diving into all of that and more in
today's version 2.0 preview live stream.

346
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:36,040
On top of that, to mark the one-year anniversary Infinity
Nikki, we've prepared a ton of special in-game events,

347
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:40,800
real-world events, and special anniversary rewards just for
our family.

348
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,520
Oh, exciting.

349
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,840
Just for us, guys.

350
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,160
You're doing it for us.

351
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:48,600
We'll be launching a whole slew of birthday-themed events
and rewards as well.

352
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:55,040
We seriously have so much we want to share with you today,
we literally may not have enough time to get through it all.

353
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:59,340
Nevertheless, be sure to stay tuned for the entire Preview
Live stream.

354
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:00,500
Exactly.

355
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,860
I'm super excited.

356
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,220
Yeah.

357
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:06,880
So why don't we start by having Johnny walk us through the
setting of version 2.0 It's a land.

358
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:12,480
From what we saw in the PV, It's a land feels like a wild,
free and fantastical land.

359
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:17,960
And the ancient Titan civilization that once lived there
left behind some ruins, didn't they?

360
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,320
Wow, you're pretty observant.

361
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:26,080
Well, with that said, let me give everyone a simple yet
proper introduction to It's a land.

362
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:35,700
Starting in version 2.0, Nikki and Momo will be venturing
into Elderwood Forest Oh, oh my god, that's a giant ass

363
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,060
shell.

364
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,420
Imagine the echo in there.

365
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:45,880
Now, as the name suggests, Elderwood Forest is a vast,
endless woodland filled with all kinds of extraordinary

366
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,160
natural wonders.

367
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,080
From the ethereal and mysterious mother shroom woods.

368
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,300
And the mushroom people died?

369
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,020
No!

370
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,180
Was that the dragon from the start?

371
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,600
I don't know, though, that's way too big.

372
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,660
Because I'm like thinking, you know, anything for fashion,
you know?

373
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:04,480
And I think, like, that mushroom cat will make it look like
a good hat.

374
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,600
A good hat, yeah.

375
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,600
I know, right?

376
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:07,940
It'll be a good hat.

377
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,480
I like the way you think.

378
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:09,860
Exactly.

379
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,140
I feel like we should be able to harvest any individual in
this forest.

380
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,500
It'd be a very different game.

381
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,760
Anything for fashion.

382
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:20,800
Oh, by the way.

383
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:21,420
Oh.

384
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,060
So what's your step?

385
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,260
That's right.

386
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,640
And perched high on a cliff, that giant snail shell you see
is the life.

387
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,020
lively city of Spira.

388
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,220
Wait, that's a snail show?

389
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:33,840
Look!

390
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,320
Look at the cost.

391
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,080
I don't know.

392
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,680
That must have been a lot of salt.

393
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,380
One of the most fascinating aspects of Spira is its snail
culture.

394
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:48,540
Getting around and sporting goods, everything relies on
snails.

395
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,980
Wouldn't that be a really slow knock?

396
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:56,600
But what if like, what if someone actually, like, that's
like a terrible thing to rely on because you just pour salt

397
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,100
on them.

398
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,260
That goes super fast.

399
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,900
Yeah, and the sun like burns them.

400
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:08,200
snail at least once but maybe they're like better snails
like highly evolved snails where you can't even kill it with

401
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:14,440
salt maybe they're immortal i'm sure nikki's time with them
that sounds terrible and laughter so now nikki's loving it

402
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:21,140
oh i heard like snail glue is really good for your skin yeah
snail needs yeah i'm definitely coming back to get like free

403
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:27,500
skincare every corner of this yeah you're just like oh my oh
yeah so it's like drifting with snails

404
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,540
It's like turbo.

405
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,560
The Park Solians.

406
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:41,880
The Park Solians are similar in size to humans, but their
most striking features are the horns on their foreheads and

407
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,460
tails on their backs.

408
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,120
Banish him.

409
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,320
He's different.

410
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,780
Do they have some connection with dragons?

411
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,620
Well, long, long ago.

412
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,600
I mean, we could, like, harvest the horns for fashion, too.

413
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,700
Yeah, look like rhinos.

414
00:23:59,100 --> 00:23:59,340
Yeah.

415
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,640
Rhinos don't deserve it.

416
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:07,940
it but like maybe these guys's horns grow back yeah they
grow back in the tail too yeah imagine you see oh it's like

417
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:19,760
a bella the fabric on the tail you know the fur yeah you use
the fur to make like so rich in this i know right journey as

418
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,140
long as i have no mores

419
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:34,960
i'm gonna i'm gonna take his tail and make it into a nice
scarf Nikki and places upon her a strange otherworldly mark

420
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:42,040
and just like that a new adventure begins while on this
journey Nikki and Momo will meet many new friends and

421
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:49,400
acquaintances including the shroomlings and the park solians
among them is a shroomling there's my favorite character

422
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:56,300
right there a courageous shroomling hero who will accompany
Nikki oh yeah he looks so brave I wonder we can like we can

423
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:04,560
like dress him up girl yeah i don't want to dress him up who
has come to it's a land at first glance she seems ordinary

424
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:12,780
but you soon get the feeling she knows something no one else
does and then like her makeup founder of it's a land's

425
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:20,840
docileism the high priestess medale she holds tremendous
influence in this place which means everyone will need to

426
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,540
tread very

427
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:32,960
or like yeah use the horns as like the for the ends of the
heel exactly or like just use it as like a like a like those

428
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:42,180
like headbatters like headgear or put them on a headband so
we can pretend to be like them unknown challenges ahead

429
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:48,880
nikki will certainly or use as like a show like put it on
the shoulders too like a shoulder pad thing yeah let me take

430
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,660
this part this is what i've been to share with you stylists.

431
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:57,260
In version 2.0, Niki will gain four brand new abilities.

432
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:04,140
They are archery, sticky claw, or grappling, gigantication,
and battle companion.

433
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:11,040
These abilities are not only connected to the map of
Itzaland, but they will also enrich Niki's adventure and

434
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,560
bring a whole new dimension to the Oh, I love this one.

435
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,560
That's my favorite.

436
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,660
That one's my favorite.

437
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:23,040
At the very beginning of version 2.0, when Niki first
arrives in Itzaland, she'll unlock the archery ability and

438
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,580
receive the four-star ability outfit, Purifying Wind.

439
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,500
For this outfit, Nikki takes inspiration.

440
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,580
I guess each outfit matches with the ability.

441
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,040
With her short hair and bow in hand, she looks sharp and
cool.

442
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,240
That's right.

443
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:44,140
Once Nikki unlocks the archery ability, she'll be able to
use her arrows to purify dark essence, handle dangerous

444
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:49,900
situations, take on bigger challenges, and reach places she
never could before.

445
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,280
That looks difficult.

446
00:26:52,320 --> 00:27:00,060
We also want to show another side of Nikki in version 2.0, a
side that can be gentle and calm, yet sharp and decisive

447
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:00,600
when needed.

448
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:05,660
Just like the wind, she's free, untamed, and impossible to
hold back.

449
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,480
Oh, and there's a fun fact.

450
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,280
Nikki was born in December, so she's actually a Sagittarius.

451
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,400
What a coincidence.

452
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,580
Oh, no lie.

453
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,600
I'm a Cancer.

454
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:19,720
Anyway, in version 2.0, Nikki embraces her role as a true
sharpshooter.

455
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,980
Every arrow shift.

456
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,280
That's the crab.

457
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,420
No, I'm just thinking of you as a crab, you know?

458
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,220
That's what I'm thinking of, you know?

459
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,480
That's what it is.

460
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,680
What are you implying?

461
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:31,960
Crab's are okay.

462
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,360
What's wrong with crab?

463
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,820
Yeah, your mom had sponsors.

464
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,580
Sponsor, thank you so much.

465
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,520
Sponsor, thank you so much.

466
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,140
Sponsor.

467
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,020
One thing stylists need to know is that my mom had pet
crabs.

468
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,260
How did you know that?

469
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:50,260
You can also greatly enhance Nikki's ability to explore an
area with it.

470
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:53,700
can aim at distant objects to activate mechanisms.

471
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,440
Oh, she's my grandma.

472
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:58,240
Let's items from afar and even shoot down a Wimstar.

473
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:03,340
Aside from archery, Nikki's other new abilities are just as
impressive.

474
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,220
Take this to you all, for example.

475
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:05,780
A grappling.

476
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,640
Yeah, that's going to be new.

477
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,060
Yeah, that's going to be new.

478
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,340
It's like a gummy ham.

479
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,440
Do you know the ones you throw at the wall?

480
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah, look.

481
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:15,280
Wait, wait, can you like grapple anywhere, like in the sky?

482
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,300
You see that?

483
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:20,840
So you just grapple in the air like Widowmaker and pull out
your bell.

484
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,640
Oh, it's so much sleeper than me.

485
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:23,920
Headshot.

486
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:25,960
Play the game.

487
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:34,080
While exploring towns, traversing levels, or running through
the wild, you might spot platforms or objects marked with

488
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:34,800
sticky amber.

489
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,960
Oh, so that's how you do it.

490
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,140
So that's what they're grappling.

491
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,980
I thought they were really just grappling air.

492
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,960
She can even pull or drag items around with it.

493
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:43,960
It's super versatile.

494
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,460
Who's putting amber on boxes?

495
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:50,840
Like, it's just like some guy was very stiff.

496
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,720
Sticky hands.

497
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,040
I have that ability.

498
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,800
She can go anywhere she wants.

499
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:56,840
Oh no, you are.

500
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,120
She's just grappling everywhere.

501
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:58,840
You see that?

502
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,700
Like, because there wasn't Amber there.

503
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,220
There was an Amber there.

504
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,380
I think those are for like auto aiming.

505
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:09,000
Using the Sticky Claw ability, grapple your way past
obstacles at high speed.

506
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,660
Swing toward the finish line.

507
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,880
That's like fast travel.

508
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,500
You can nab the top spot.

509
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,240
Get ready, Silas.

510
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,360
Let's see who's got the best moves when version 2.0 drops.

511
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:19,780
Oh, I do.

512
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,840
Next, we have an ability.

513
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:21,880
that's big.

514
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:23,580
Gigantification.

515
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:28,040
Deep in Elderwood Forest lives across massive creatures.

516
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,680
We imagine the fur pelts.

517
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,360
Oh my god.

518
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,300
Imagine the jacket that you can make out of this guy.

519
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,500
The Uggs.

520
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,640
Oh, they're gonna...

521
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,520
Oh, it's...

522
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:37,900
Oh, wait!

523
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:44,820
I told you guys, imagine the outfit.

524
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,460
You're the outfit, yeah.

525
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,780
Fun fact, when Nikki uses the gigantic...

526
00:29:50,860 --> 00:30:06,240
ability her size increases by more than three oh my gosh she
finally went from 5.9 to 6.1 511 to 6 foot yeah it's crazy

527
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:14,780
identify she can also unleash a thunderous roar so also
unlock a charge skill that will allow her to sweep across an

528
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:25,520
entire battlefield with oh my gosh she's just find giant
folders apparently like the longer you play I was reading it

529
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:47,720
the longer you play the bigger you get what I was gonna be
oh my god it's gonna be like a kaiju fight who did you kill

530
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,360
for this outfit battle companion ability I wonder.

531
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,560
It looks like a dragon.

532
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,420
It does.

533
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,420
Like a furry dragon.

534
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:54,900
Yeah.

535
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:55,960
Reporting for duty.

536
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,900
You know, in certain areas of version 2.0, Nikki can summon
Phantom Queen.

537
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,300
Oh, I have like pillow pets too.

538
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,740
Oh, so this is like a summoner.

539
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

540
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,940
So Nikki won't be fighting alone anymore.

541
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,140
And those are the four plans.

542
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,240
Oh, we're going to have friends.

543
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,000
In version 2.0.

544
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,560
So you can have friends fight for me.

00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:29,660

00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:23,000
The ancient legends of this land, tales of gods and their
deeds remain shrouded in mystery.

553
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:32,320
Meanwhile, the mysterious task entrusted to Nikki served as
a subtle guide, both a warning and a hint of what is yet to

554
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:32,660
come.

555

different direction now this theme of common origins yet

635
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:44,820
divergent destinies lies at the very heart of these two i
read that book divergent when faith collapses and prayers go

636
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:49,920
unanswered do we yield to the or rise to challenge fate
itself.

637
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:55,000
With that question in mind, let's take a closer look at the
details of these outfits.

638
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,400
Let's start with the Divine Maiden.

639
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,680
Oh, Divine Maiden.

00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:04,740
We have so many inspirations for like new outfits with this
game.

641
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,900
What is stopping us from dressing like this every day?

642
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,220
Besides time.

643
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,460
Okay, like we nearly talked about it.

644
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,020

golden hue with the skirt draped and delicate sumptuous oh i

Behind prayer, silent ashes.

687
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,680
Rose petals whirl.

688
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,160

vengeance.

00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:03,580
The very princess's new colors are deep black and dark
crimson, with the skirt adorned in rubies and delicate

701
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,420
beaded chains.

Oh my gosh.

706
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,840
That's an expensive ass outfit if it's adorned with rubies.

707
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,160
Yeah, girl, don't slam your dress on that one.

708
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:20,520
Well, I'm gonna like, I'm gonna steal the dress and just
pick out the rubies.

709
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,920
Grab some scissors and just go snip snip.

You're just like, you're just like grabbing the rubies.

715
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:36,020
She's there exponentially into the fate itself.

00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,400
The outfit- Dude, her crown alone can pay for like my red
for the next 20 years.

717
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:42,560
And dress option.

718
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:50,160
Stylists can decide whether to wear the veil, tweak the
skirt length and craft a look that's entirely their own.

719
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:57,680
And when stylists reach 160 poles, they'll unlock the
exclusive decoration, Sanctum of Heart.

720
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,340
Oh, you unlock a cage.

You unlock a cage and lock yourself in.

722
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,460
The storytelling is simply unmatched.

723
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:13,200
Not only that, glowing up the outfit will also unlock a new
color variant.

724
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:21,760
The dark green hues combined with her golden hair oh i like

month yes

737
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:13,100
yet it really leaves a little bit of a heavy feeling the
divine maiden who would tell such a story must have carried

738
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,740
so much suffering and I agree.

739
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,520
Now, if someone's like, can you drop your friend asking for
a friend?

Oh, yeah, you're right.

749
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:51,780
It pays itself.

753
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:00,440
Exactly.

754
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,800
The core concept of this outfit revolves around scars and
light.

755
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,940
The her destiny lies in ruins.

756
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:07,440
Oh.

757
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,000
Their body bears countless scars.

758
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,040
Each mark...

759
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,620
But that was the outfit in the intro.

760
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:12,460
You remember it?

761
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:14,220
Like a tutorial?

762
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:21,920
her passive wounds haven't blessed her divinity they've
become a unique tapestry of strength and radiance the makeup

763
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:30,600
design adds a final enchanting touch perfectly extenuating
the outfit's delicate oh cute i like that her face is

glimmers and my little pony character.

766

00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:43,460
I'm sorry.

768
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:44,800
That's why you left this.

769
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:50,320
The base version of Born Plolus actually includes two
different designs for the headwear and the back.

770
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:57,380
I like the small details that they do for the outfit to
enhance, like even the smallest thing.

771
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:57,760
Oh, there's something!

772
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,000
Oh, the pendant details.

773
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:00,780
Look at the glitter.

774
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,660
Oh, I want to eat that outfit.

775
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:03,860
Oh, that's cute.

776
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:05,180
Color palette to vibrate.

777
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:06,880
Oh, he's like green, too.

778
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,260
Compromises by warmth and warmth.

779
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:08,940
Good observation.

780
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,260
There's like the different colors you can pick for it.

781
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,120
It's not just blue.

782
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:13,880
I like the orange hair.

783
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:15,620
Oh, the red.

784
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:16,080
Wow.

785
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:18,520
The blood of your enemies.

786
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:20,120
Yes.

787
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:24,520
Oh, I really like the black face, like the face makeup.

788
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:25,120
That's cool.

789
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:34,060
From the vibrant green of new beginnings to the steadfast
red of resolve, what hue will the third evolution adopt when

790
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:36,580
the saintess bears the weight of her ultimate destiny?

791
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:41,160
evolution and see for ourselves.

792
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,880
Wait, Chibi, I just noticed you have horns.

793
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:45,400
What?

794
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:46,860
You have horns.

795
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:47,660
What?

796
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,240
Sorry, I have a horn.

797
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:51,880
You had horns.

798
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:52,560
It's okay, don't worry.

799
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,200
I'll make sure to be...

800
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,940
I'll make good use of it.

801
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,700
Don't turn them into like a backscrap or something.

802
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:05,540
This is why I come back every couple of months because the
horns grow back and...

803
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,140
Dude, like, that is hard to stick me.

804
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:13,440
Daddy's got a new client that needs those horns.

805
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:16,680
So what if someone commissioned another freaking set of
heels?

806
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:17,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

807
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:19,020
I'm like, get over here.

808
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:20,100
Get over here, Chad.

809
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:23,040
That's like outer space.

810
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:23,760
It's like cosmic.

811
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:24,340
Wow.

812
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:25,820
Impressive, isn't it?

813
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:31,200
This is the outfit's third evolution, born flawless,
mirrored self.

814
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:38,760
The outfit is cloaked in a profound, inky black, while the
hem radiates a pure white glow, like light piercing through

815
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:39,180
darkness.

816
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,440
Scattered across her form.

817
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:43,960
Oh, I guess it's like the final evolution of the outfit.

818
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:45,400
Oh, Maria Barat Malice.

819
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:46,800
Every shift of the life.

820
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:49,720
It looks like her makeup has changed as well.

821
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,200
The mark on her forehead is more defined.

822
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:55,300
And her eyes are deeper and more determined.

823
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:57,480
They're more glittery.

824
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:58,920
Yeah, like crystallized.

825
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:00,360
Oh, my God, you could take it off.

826
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:05,560
Oh, oh, there's, yeah, you could take off like the sweeping
thing.

827
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,680
Yeah, like if it's getting your feet, you can get a lot.

828
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,000

I just don't see it just don't seize and that's it star
resonance outfits what do you think Alina hmm it looks like

849
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:20,620
the saintess didn't take the same destroy everything rude
the divine maiden did I wonder if there are any hidden

850
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:28,120
surprises then again the divine maiden is a character the
saintess herself created maybe she poured some of her own

851
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:34,940
and spooky feelings into the divine maiden things she
couldn't say out loud which makes me even wonder Did

852
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:38,660
DeSantis really never doubt herself, not even for a second?

853
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:41,820
That's a very interesting question.

854
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:48,760
As for the truth behind these two outfits, let's leave it to
the stylist to uncover as they experience them in the game.

Yeah, little does he know I'm...

869
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,740
The song was just a bait.

870
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:43,540
They cut away because we started, like, taking him.

871
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:45,260
Oh, cute!

872
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:45,980
I like the swoop.

873
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:47,480
Oh, yeah, it's like a belly dancing.

874
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,740
He shared the same banner as Born Flawless.

875
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:51,960
It's like the Pied Piper.

876
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:53,860
You know, I lured the rats in with my song.

877
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:55,540
Oh, yeah, dude.

878
00:52:56,320 --> 00:53:00,160
The entire ensemble glimmer is getting captivated in the
way.

879
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,960
It's like, mama needs a new jacket.

880
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:05,680
You could just spread joy wherever she goes.

881
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:09,040
The outfit's ability is even more playful.

882
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:11,220
When activated, here's the diaper chat.

883
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:13,000
Get it.

884
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:15,940
Wait, none of the other mush kids are wearing diapers.

885
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,920
Like, what's wrong with this mushroom?

886
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,900
Oh, I like the black.

887
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:22,860
He's a little special.

888
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,680
Also, I like the black version of that.

889
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:28,200
Yeah, I like the blue hair.

890
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:33,500
Guys, there can't be only one mushroom baby.

891
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:34,600
There has to be more.

892
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:36,620
I'm not even kidding.

893
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:37,900
This has been so entertaining.

894
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:39,300
I've been so locked in.

895
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:40,820
I'm not even kidding.

896
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:41,920
I've been so into this.

897
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,500
I just like seeing all the different outfits.

898
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:46,620
I love folding designs.

899
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,400
Yeah, the designs are so pretty.

900
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:50,280
The resonance banner outfits.

901
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,500
There are plenty more outfits coming to version 2.0.

902
00:53:53,960 --> 00:54:01,320
In fact, another very important reason Nikki's journey to
Itzalan is to discover new miracle outfits.

903
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:09,340
And as she unravels the secrets of this region, she stumbles
upon clues that point her toward the miracle outfit,

904
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:11,180
Providence in Memorial.

905
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:19,400
By completing the main storyline quest in version 2.0,
stylists will unlock all the sketches for Providence in

906
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:24,820
Memorial, allowing them to obtain this exquisitely stunning
outfit in its entirety.

907
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:30,420
Now, let's take a look at the PV for the new miracle outfit
outfit, the Providence in Memorial.

908

Those are sharp gloves.

915
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:45,560

01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:51,120
They will lead you in the right direction.

991
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:57,760
And doesn't a mother shroom's dream mean that deep within
the dungeon, secrets about the mother shroom are waiting to

992
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:58,160
be uncovered.

993
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:01,560
It means we harvest the entire family to make this outfit.

994
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,240
Oh, you get a buff if it's the whole thing.

995
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:09,360
The second dungeon takes us deep into Elderwood Forest,
where the foreboding Colosseum awaits.

996
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:13,540
This dungeon is a remnant of the ancient Titan civilization.

997
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:23,480
countless relics from a long forgotten era lie in quiet
repose though shrouded in dust they stand as silent

998
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:31,980
witnesses to a bygone age offering stylists a glimpse of the
once magnificent glory check the she-con jewel the

999
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:40,440
shrewlings near the coliseum said what is going on peaceful
lately they can hear strange noises yeah i'm scared i don't

1000
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:43,460
think this door is not holding him I don't think this door's
gonna hold him out.

1001
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:44,060
He's kind of weak, actually.

1002
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:45,440
I'm actually not breaking that.

1003
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,140
Yeah, I'm not that scared.

1004
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:49,200
That door not broken yet.

1005
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:50,140
Is he declawed?

1006
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:54,360
Don't declaw your monsters, guys.

1007
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:57,740
Unless you can make fashion.

1008
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:01,160
Yeah, because unless it's for fashion, unless it's...

1009
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,120
Unless you can put them on your own nails.

1010
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:03,700
Yeah.

1011
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,240
Then it's awesome.

1012
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:11,840
It also means that the vault is heavily guarded.

1013
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,760
with traps everywhere.

1014
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:14,280
Oh.

1015
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:16,580
And alarms go off.

1016
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:18,640
Why don't we just leave the monsters in here?

1017
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:20,900
It's like, it's like a farm.

1018
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:23,560
Now, did any, like a skeleton farm?

1019
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:25,600
Yeah, like a, like a mob spawn.

1020
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:26,540
Yeah, a mob farm.

1021
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:31,300
This is where stylists can really take advantage of Nikki's
posing for the cameras while she's robbing.

1022
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:31,760
Yeah.

1023
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:36,000
It can be like a master cat burglar and slip past all the
criminals.

1024
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:37,980
It's up to you.

1025
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:38,720
I have a crush.

1026
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:39,640
Oh, yeah.

1027
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:40,960
Yeah, yeah, true, true, true.

1028
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:51,040
police of course i mean what would it's a crime to have all
this jewels locked up our new eslings are unmistakably from

1029
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:58,180
this land their unique designs exuding the lively spirit of
the forest why are they so unhappy each have a unique

1030
01:02:58,180 --> 01:03:05,740
appearance because they don't have like my shoes oh that's
true own special trait for example the earthbound wolfhead

1031
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:13,320
will break into a dance commanding its minions to form a
coordinated formation around its own cute Oh, I want to eat

1032
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:13,780
these guys.

1033
01:03:14,060 --> 01:03:15,620
Intense version of certain Esalenes.

1034
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:19,960
If you run into one of them in the wild, you'll need to
stand high alert.

1035
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:21,400
Those are nice feathers.

1036
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:23,160
They'll go great with my hat.

1037
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:24,660
I love the way you're thinking.

1038
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:25,040
I know, right?

1039
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:26,000
But too bad for them.

1040
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:29,860
Now, Nikki is the best sharpshooter in all of Italy.

1041
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:34,540
These Esalenes, Nikki will wipe them out without even
breaking a sweat.

1042
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:39,180
And finally, Nikki and Momo will face their toughest
challenge yet.

1043
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:42,280
a battle atop the very peak of Spira.

1044
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:45,260
This time, things are a bit different.

1045
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:52,640
Stylists will discover that the environment constantly
changes, delivering a dynamic and unique battle experience

1046
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:53,960
like never before.

1047
01:03:54,680 --> 01:04:00,920
The battle unfolds in stages, with each phase introducing
brand new mechanics and puzzles.

1048
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:03,440
Oh, there's like parkour.

1049
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:04,380
Yeah.

1050
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:10,300
Moving at just the right moment to overcome the many
obstacles that Oh, that's true.

1051
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:13,520
As the battle progresses, Stylos will encounter...

1052
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:14,600
Or like a pendant friend.

1053
01:04:14,740 --> 01:04:15,240
Oh, no!

1054
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:17,400
Bebe, bebe, bebe, bebe, so boots.

1055
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:18,500
Every decision is crucial.

1056
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:19,780
And victory...

1057
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:23,480
I feel like I could use, like, you know, like the hands?

1058
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:25,380
Or like a cape.

1059
01:04:26,420 --> 01:04:26,780
Ooh!

1060
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:28,460
That'd be a nice cape.

1061
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:31,460
This boss battle will be a piece of cape for Nikki.

1062
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:34,360
With their newly unlocked abilities, it will be like...

1063
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:35,160
Does he have scoliosis?

1064
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:37,160
I did.

1065
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:38,180
All right.

1066
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:38,960
I feel represented.

1067
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:41,260
He just wanted to be represented.

1068
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:42,900
Look, there's you in the game.

Oh, what's the rush?

1071
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:49,080
I mean, we still have plenty of time.

1072
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:52,080
So before we do that, let's take a little break.

1073
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:55,620
It's almost December, and you know what that means.

1074
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:56,900
That's right.

1075
01:04:57,020 --> 01:04:59,080
The holiday season is almost upon us.

1076
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:03,840
That's why we are bringing you a little holiday update from
Nikki and Momo.

Don't they like live next to each other?

1082

Can't they just talk to each other?

1083
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:27,460
Maybe they're like in bed and they won't get up.

1084
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:28,160
Oh, yes.

1085
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:28,600

01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:18,880
Over the past year, Nikki has traveled to new places, made
new friends, and experienced so much along the way.

1153
01:10:19,660 --> 01:10:25,440

1182
01:11:36,940 --> 01:11:38,360
All of these.

1183
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:42,080
ugly friend.

1184
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:48,720
Nikki looked really pretty in that shot.

1185
01:11:48,820 --> 01:11:50,220
I don't know why.

1186
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:50,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1187
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:54,020
When she was there with those, with my friends, she looked
so pretty.

1188
01:11:54,020 --> 01:11:55,520
With those peasants that didn't have this outfit.

1189
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:01,120
She looked so pretty around them for some reason.

1190
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:09,040
Nikki, you're the best stylist.

1191
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:12,440
Nanoi, Gerota, Rambi, and so many others.

1192
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:14,340
All these memories are coming back.

1193
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:20,420
The moment Nikki stands in the starlight, sword in hand,
moving forward, it's incredibly moving.

1194
01:12:20,860 --> 01:12:22,020
I love this outfit.

1195
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:23,980
I would wear that.

1196
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:25,220
It's really one of a kind.

1197
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:26,080
That's right.

1198
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:27,400
Like, in battle?

1199
01:12:27,740 --> 01:12:29,220
Or like, like, outside?

1200
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:30,280
Like at Walmart.

1201
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:31,260
At Walmart.

1202
01:12:32,740 --> 01:12:37,600
You know, like, those people, if you see videos of those
people, like, in old Victorian dresses, And he, like,

1203
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:39,660
dressed that every day.

1204
01:12:41,420 --> 01:12:44,520
By simply logging in, you can claim it for free.

1205
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:45,960
Yeah, December 6, guys.

1206
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:46,400
Remember.

1207
01:12:47,740 --> 01:12:48,920
She comes with a stylus.

1208
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:49,420
Yeah.

1209
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:49,740
Yes.

1210
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:51,240
Oh.

1211
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:53,280
Oh.

1212
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:54,680
So, you get it.

1213
01:12:54,740 --> 01:12:55,880
I still like the Difa.

1214
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:57,380
More.

1215
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:00,060
The red makes her look more badass, though, I will admit.

1216
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:00,680
Yeah.

1217
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:01,500
Like a battle.

1218
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:03,060
Yeah, like battle ready.

1219
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:04,600
White-based and layered.

1220
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:06,160
I like this version more.

1221
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:06,640
Oh, yeah.

1222
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:07,860
The socks are cute.

1223
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,840
Golden accents add delicate details.

1224
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,020
I like all the earrings though.

1225
01:13:13,620 --> 01:13:14,440
I like the earrings.

1226
01:13:14,660 --> 01:13:16,360
If you run too fast, then it stabs you in the neck.

1227
01:13:16,460 --> 01:13:17,420
That's true, yeah.

1228
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:18,540
Do you have earrings?

1229
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:19,440
Do you wear earrings?

1230
01:13:19,860 --> 01:13:21,020
No, I don't have any piercings.

1231
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:22,280
Me too, I don't either.

1232
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:27,040
I was too scared to do it when I was young and then I got
too scared today.

1233
01:13:28,420 --> 01:13:29,840
I cry when I get shots.

1234
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:31,700
I don't like the like stab.

1235
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:36,140
Like, and then you heard like people who do get piercings,
they can get ear infections.

01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:49,400
Oh, yeah, the thumbs.

1312
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:52,060
I think, like, I'm old.

1313
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:53,980
I've seen those before.

1314
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:55,820
But there's not that easy.

1315
01:19:56,380 --> 01:20:01,920
they're okay they're sort of like a bit difficult to make
because it's not comfortable like i'm making it i can't do

1316
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:07,920
the like the zoomer heart i'm doing the heart i don't think
that's the zoomer heart i think it is if you ask a young

1317
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:12,440
person to make a heart with their hands that's how they do
it now not like the one word you know like the old one with

1318
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:19,280
the with the thumbs on the bottom and like yeah yeah that's
how i do it yeah but then there's no and well there's the

1319
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:26,360
other one with the two thumbs the two thumbs it's a small
heart i thought you were talking about that yes yeah And

1320
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:31,060
like, if you ask a young person to go on the phone, they
just, they don't do the pinky and thumb anymore.

1321
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:32,880
They don't do that because they're like, what is that?

1322
01:20:32,980 --> 01:20:34,180
They just do text, do texting.

1323
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:35,100
I know.

1324
01:20:35,380 --> 01:20:42,580
And there was like this video I watched where like they were
giving a child like, uh, like, like old, old, like 90s, 90

1325
01:20:42,580 --> 01:20:43,360
to 80s things.

1326
01:20:43,860 --> 01:20:45,460
And then they were like, what is that?

1327
01:20:45,580 --> 01:20:47,040
Is that like a computer?

1328
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:51,020
Like they gave them a little, I think it was like a...

1329
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:52,860
Oh, it's sad enough.

1330
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:55,320
Or it's woven into every part of the experience.

1331
01:20:56,260 --> 01:21:02,800

You see the dog?

1390
01:24:03,390 --> 01:24:04,090
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1391
01:24:04,230 --> 01:24:06,270
You were not in the right link.

1392
01:24:06,510 --> 01:24:06,530
What?

1393
01:24:06,530 --> 01:24:06,630
What?

1394
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:07,610
What?

1395
01:24:08,070 --> 01:24:08,070
What?

1396
01:24:08,770 --> 01:24:09,490
Oh, please.

1397
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:10,510
I am in the right link.

1398
01:24:10,690 --> 01:24:11,150
I wish we were.

1399
01:24:11,410 --> 01:24:13,790
All right, we're going to do a fashion review now.

1400
01:24:14,490 --> 01:24:15,650
This dog has my head.

1401
01:24:16,670 --> 01:24:17,210
No, no.

1402
01:24:17,450 --> 01:24:17,990
Yours is bigger.

1403
01:24:18,310 --> 01:24:20,190
Because, like, you can still... Shut the fuck up.

1404
01:24:22,850 --> 01:24:25,110
Your head is bigger than your body.

1405
01:24:25,130 --> 01:24:28,710
This dog's head is like, like half the size of his body.

1406
01:24:29,210 --> 01:24:34,270
I'm very surprised you can keep your head up and you're not
just like dragging your head while you're walking down the

1407
01:24:34,270 --> 01:24:34,730
street.

1408
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:36,290
We're sponsored.

1409
01:24:39,290 --> 01:24:43,570
And that's, oh, to be fair, it does make sense because like
in her head there's like no, nothing inside.

1410
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:45,190
So it's like just like air.

1411
01:24:45,750 --> 01:24:49,630
So like it's easier to keep it up.

1412
01:24:50,270 --> 01:24:51,830
Do you see this cheese on my head?

1413
01:24:52,150 --> 01:24:52,490
Yeah.

1414
01:24:52,670 --> 01:24:54,370
That's like all the weight that's on it.

1415
01:24:55,130 --> 01:25:05,930
you don't want to mess with me what's up with the cheese i'm
a weapon yeah it's like a balloon yeah it's like a balloon

1416
01:25:05,930 --> 01:25:13,410
well well you're so lucky to be normally proportioned the
head is like pulling up the entire body

1417
01:25:20,740 --> 01:25:27,860
anyway i love the for this outfit i do i think my favorite
i'm sorry my favorite part is the dog The dog makes the

1418
01:25:27,860 --> 01:25:28,340
outfit.

1419
01:25:28,780 --> 01:25:30,540
Does the dog have like a braid on it?

1420
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:31,760
Wait, does he?

1421
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:33,040
Wait, does.

1422
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:34,120
Did he weave his hair?

1423
01:25:34,420 --> 01:25:36,540
I think – no, is that the harness?

1424
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:37,920
No, it's the harness, right?

1425
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:39,320
No, it is.

1426
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:41,580

1436
01:25:55,660 --> 01:25:56,860

Oh, that's so hard to pick because you're all like.

1524
01:31:36,340 --> 01:31:38,820
I think the hardest part is that you have your one person.

1525
01:31:40,580 --> 01:31:43,420
But I guess you can swap your wardrobe all the time.

1526
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:45,300
But it's so hard to pick your favorite outfit.

1527
01:31:46,060 --> 01:31:47,220
This one's really good.

1528
01:31:48,020 --> 01:31:49,260

It's so cute.

1534
01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:01,700
It's called nameless selfless.

1535
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,740
That was called selfless.

1536
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:04,480
So it's like the...

1537
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:05,220
Candle with echoes.

1538
01:32:06,140 --> 01:32:07,840
It's like the one where...

1539
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:09,940
Like she's having a great wedding.

1540
01:32:10,180 --> 01:32:11,760
And then the next one is like she killed her husband.

1541
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:13,220
And she took the money.

1542
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:14,020

Yeah, yes!

1544
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:16,100
Yes, you know what?

1545
01:32:16,260 --> 01:32:17,080
She's like the heir.

1546
01:32:17,180 --> 01:32:21,680
Like she married into like a baron or whatever.

1547
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:24,260
And then the baron slipped and fell down the stairs.

1548
01:32:24,420 --> 01:32:25,820
