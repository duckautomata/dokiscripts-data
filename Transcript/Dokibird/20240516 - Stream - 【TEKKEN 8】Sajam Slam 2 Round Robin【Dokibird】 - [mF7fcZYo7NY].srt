1
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,470
Let's go baby!

2
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,750
Everybody is a tree.

3
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,270
Do you want to call MYK daddy?

4
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:48,350
No.

5
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,310
Don't talk about my coach that way!

6
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,910
Don't talk about my coach that way!

7
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:54,810
Sensualize the coach!

8
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:56,730
Okay.

9
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:00,270
Who had the soundboard in their audio?

10
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,110
Who had the soundboard in their audio?

11
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,630
Who did that?

12
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,570
Why was it James who started that?

13
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,570
Why was it James who started that?

14
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,330
So yes, you'll be playing against everybody.

15
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:13,090
The round robin today is worth 3 points per match.

16
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:18,470
So if your team wins 3-2, let's say, you'll have won the round robin 9-6.

17
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,150
If your team somehow wins every match, you can win 15-0.

18
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,910
The round robin on Friday is worth 5 points per match.

19
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,150
So it's worth almost double.

20
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:32,450
Meaning that if you do well today, it's really good because you can secure a lead for Friday.

21
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,050
Friday is worth so much.

22
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:39,650
So really it's about how much you can improve from today to Friday and then take that improvement all the way to Sunday.

23
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,750
And then try to win in the bracket on there.

24
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:46,670
On Sunday, the rule will be the first team to 3 wins instead of the normal points.

25
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,090
So it'll have the traditional format we did last time.

26
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:54,650
But for the round robin, we wanted everybody to play because last time Scar's team died and he played twice out of 5 matches.

27
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:55,730
As an example.

28
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,090
So that was not fun for him.

29
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,990
So we figured it's more fun if everybody gets to play every match.

30
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:01,830
Not this time, baby!

31
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,230
Okay, I muted myself in Discord.

32
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:06,790
Don't say that to your team, bro.

33
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,930
By the way, are we allowed to stream with orientation?

34
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:10,250
I can't focus!

35
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,290
I'm not playing ranked because I'm scared.

36
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,810
I was like, if we weren't, well I'm so screwed.

37
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,830
I can't focus!

38
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,490
There's so many voices in my head!

39
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,950
There's so many voices in my head!

40
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,010
There's so many voices in my head!

41
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:24,050
That's very important about this.

42
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:25,190
Hello?

43
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:25,770
Can anybody hear me?

44
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,230
There's so many voices in my head!

45
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:30,250
There's so many voices in my head!

46
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,010
They're a bit loud.

47
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,070
Okay, I'll turn them down.

48
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,930
Sound guy, are you here?

49
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,770
And you'll have downtime between matches because when you're not playing...

50
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:40,190
There's too many.

51
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,490
There's too many voices in my head!

52
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:42,990
You have time.

53
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:46,310
Okay, I brought down the Discord volume.

54
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,650
You have some time there.

55
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:49,790
Everybody will be playing at the same time.

56
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,730
One thing that's important is that...

57
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,430
I can't just ignore them!

58
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:57,370
The exceptions are people who are not playing on PC.

59
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,670
Those are the people who like...

60
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,130
Okay, I turned them down.

61
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:01,450
Okay, I turned them down.

62
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:02,590
Sorry, guys.

63
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,530
We go straight into rules.

64
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,050
So that's gonna be a little odd.

65
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,930
But if you are not playing on PC, just let RTOs know.

66
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,430
And then we can get that figured out.

67
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,790
And you can get added by your coach.

68
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:15,430
If you're a coach, I'm gonna stream real quick.

69
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:18,170
And show you how to make the lobby in a really easy way.

70
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:21,410
And if anybody else wants to watch, it'll probably make it easy for you.

71
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:22,990
It's so good.

72
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,510
Yeah, there's a really simple way to do it.

73
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:26,630
That's really nice.

74
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,930
So let me share my screen real quick.

75
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,470
I did the copy-paste thing.

76
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:34,250
Guys, this might be the old PC.

77
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,910
But I don't crash anymore.

78
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,450
Guys, guys!

79
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,330
I did unpack the PC!

80
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:39,750
I did unpack the PC!

81
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:42,790
I just... I just didn't plug it in.

82
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,150
Any place near your house.

83
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,790
It can be a burrito or a burrito bar.

84
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,050
It's so good!

85
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,570
So the way this works...

86
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,130
Oh, I missed it.

87
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,470
If you haven't done this before, is when you go to player match, and create the room.

88
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:01,230
And then one thing I would advise is putting on a coat.

89
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,250
Under advanced settings.

90
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,650
Oh, God.

91
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,050
Please.

92
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,010
Have mercy.

93
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:06,950
I'm new.

94
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:11,350
I would also recommend adding simultaneous rooms.

95
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:15,330
This is so that if your team wants to practice while you play, you can practice.

96
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,270
Then you click create session.

97
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:18,650
Oh my God, he ducks!

98
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:19,590
He plays against kings!

99
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,030
Important thing.

100
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:25,310
The main match and whoever is playing next should always be in group A.

101
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,850
Please do not be like, oh, my teammate just started his match.

102
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:31,950
I'm gonna go play on group B or one of these other places.

103
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:32,850
And then hold up the event.

104
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,170
I will make fun of you a lot.

105
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,170
Everybody will make fun of you.

106
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:36,510
Please don't hold up the event.

107
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,950
If you're gonna play next...

108
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,550
Yeah, go for it.

109
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:46,710
Can you please, on record, state that I'm not a player?

110
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:47,870
No!

111
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:48,850
No!

112
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,010
No!

113
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:50,430
No!

114
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,670
That's right, you can't duck that!

115
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,850
I don't know.

116
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:59,590
I played him and he was wifi'd.

117
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:00,210
So...

118
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,950
You gotta post the picture for proof.

119
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,270
No, please stop!

120
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,430
I got the vibe.

121
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:08,490
So, if you take a peek at my screen here.

122
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,350
You see shift tab, you see this overlay here.

123
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,930
The easiest way to invite people is you click friends.

124
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,950
Click your little profile picture here.

125
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,790
Yay, fight or flight!

126
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:21,270
And then you go to where it says join game.

127
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,210
You just click copy link address.

128
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:27,930
And when you post it, someone can just post it in their browser and they'll automatically join your lobby.

129
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,130
Okay, but what if I do this?

130
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,830
That's like one of the only thing I can do.

131
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:32,870
And I...

132
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,050
Please!

133
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:36,090
I'm sorry!

134
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:36,090
Please!

135
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:37,430
I'm sorry!

136
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:37,730
I'm sorry!

137
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:39,230
I'm sorry!

138
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,910
You can't duck this!

139
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,270
And if anybody's on console, just let the TOs know.

140
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,050
And they'll handle that.

141
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:49,150
Okay, another question.

142
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,710
Did you get bonus points for playing an honest character like Dragunov?

143
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:53,410
Did you get bonus points for playing an honest character like Dragunov?

144
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,570
Alright, so hopefully you've all enjoyed that.

145
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,050
Thank you!

146
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,890
I'll be interviewing some coaches and stuff.

147
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,030
Good luck, good luck everybody.

148
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,770
Thank you!

149
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:03,290
Bye!

150
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,110
Good luck, have fun!

151
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,590
I actually said that on live television.

152
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:09,550
I can't believe it.

153
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,070
Very nervous.

154
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:17,490
I came into this thinking y'all were dudes.

155
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,010
And I was running to take you out the end of the chair.

156
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:19,010
No!

157
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,130
He did duck!

158
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:20,550
Okay.

159
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,410
I was like what the fuck did y'all sign me up for?

160
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:22,990
Nice.

161
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,650
Yeah, we good.

162
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:27,510
Did everybody leave yet?

163
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:28,150
I can't tell.

164
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,210
I'm too busy in the game.

165
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,670
I'm so sad.

166
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,610
Blue rings and stuff.

167
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:33,370
I'm like what's going on?

168
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,630
I should have swapped up the first one.

169
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:38,110
He's just better.

170
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:40,530
I'm sorry.

171
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,190
Don't watch my videos then.

172
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:47,790
Because I've not processed anything in this orientation.

173
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,230
Signify, can you meet me?

174
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,290
Is everybody still in the VC?

175
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,870
Oh shit, everybody left!

176
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:58,770
That's a lot.

177
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,610
Did I lose real quick?

178
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,710
They're gonna be scared for sure.

179
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,630
I'm gonna lose real quick.

180
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,610
No, no, no, no.

181
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:06,850
No, don't lose.

182
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:07,650
No, no, no.

183
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,210
You wanna keep the 13 win streak, dude.

184
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,130
No, I don't because they're gonna play me differently.

185
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:14,530
They're like oh my god, I'm gonna play scared and I'm not gonna predict it.

186
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,210
I would rather they play me no knowledge whatsoever.

187
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:18,990
Come on, man.

188
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:22,510
I think that's just putting it all out on the table, you know?

189
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:24,270
We'll see.

190
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,690
It worked for me last time.

191
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,330
I had a 20 win streak last slam.

192
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,550
I decided to throw it so it didn't say that I had it.

193
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:34,010
Someone in the chat saying they don't save from quick match.

194
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,930
I don't know anything about it though.

195
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:38,150
Uh, oh shit.

196
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:38,930
Well, whatever.

197
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,210
I don't know anything about it.

198
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:45,870
So they want all the coaches to make a lobby?

199
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:50,030
Yeah, you make a lobby and then I guess just post it.

200
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:53,570
And then...

201
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,870
How big?

202
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,230
Like max or...

203
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,310
I don't know.

204
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:01,390
I don't know either, bro.

205
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:01,930
I don't know.

206
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,050
Yo, good shit yesterday.

207
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:10,210
Alright.

208
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,790
Good shit is a crazy thing to say about yesterday.

209
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:14,750
What do you mean?

210
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,970
I saw that adaptability, bro.

211
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:18,990
A key charge?

212
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:22,210
Don't worry about that.

213
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,250
But you did good.

214
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,570
I watched the whole thing.

215
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:25,190
It was fucking sick.

216
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,650
I didn't catch it.

217
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,110
Bro, first set you got third, right?

218
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:29,070
Yeah.

219
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,350
That's pretty good.

220
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,790
I'll tell you something, Kony.

221
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,790
I mean, you know this better than most.

222
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,510
You go for something like an offstage balcony punch.

223
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:42,230
And then it goes south.

224
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:43,770
And then it goes to game five.

225
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:46,850
Yeah, you were awake, right?

226
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,630
3 AM thinking about that punch.

227
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:49,730
That's all I'm saying.

228
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:50,670
I feel it.

229
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:53,070
It was a one-to-one equipment.

230
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,170
Well, Bear has a lot of people like him, right?

231
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:01,790
Like, I'm gonna be really funny and then spit on my back a lot and then Dragon off punches you in the fucking skull.

232
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:02,330
And you're like, oh.

233
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:03,870
Yeah.

234
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,850
Yeah, it was bad.

235
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:06,730
Not gonna lie.

236
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,730
I saw you tweet whoops.

237
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,310
So I assumed that's what that was.

238
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,870
Yeah, that was.

239
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,650
Also, hi Doki.

240
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:15,490
I don't think we've met.

241
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:16,170
Hey!

242
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:22,050
My fingers are not used to playing this early in the morning.

243
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,350
That's how I'm feeling, dude.

244
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,510
I've been playing Tekken at 11 PM.

245
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,830
Doki, it is 6 PM on the East Coast.

246
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,050
That's too early for Tekken.

247
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:31,490
Not too early for Coast.

248
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:32,310
That's too early for Tekken.

249
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,030
That's crazy.

250
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,290
Tekken is 3 AM vibes.

251
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:36,870
I respect it.

252
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:42,170
Tekken is a night game, not a morning game.

253
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:43,530
Tekken is a night game, not a morning game.

254
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,550
I'll shake on that.

255
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:45,490
That's absolutely true.

256
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,050
That's absolutely true.

257
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,390
I'm so, I'm so fucked.

258
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:57,210
I saw the intel report and I felt like everybody had Tekken experience in the newbie categories.

259
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,090
Except for me.

260
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:00,330
Don't worry.

261
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:02,310
All for free.

262
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,810
I'm here for the moral support, guys.

263
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,390
I'm here for the moral support.

264
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:09,830
I'm here for the moral support.

265
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,290
You did hit an RDC on the computer.

266
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,850
I know, right?

267
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,590
That was so hard to do.

268
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,810
I hope they stand still for me to do the RDC.

269
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:21,010
I hope they stand still for me to do the RDC.

270
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:21,670
I hope they stand still for me to do the RDC.

271
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:28,070
Yeah, the rate of play is like way higher on this one.

272
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:28,310
Yeah, the rate of play is like way higher on this one.

273
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:30,610
Even the lower ranks is like...

274
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:31,170
I don't know.

275
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,430
People are taking this stuff seriously.

276
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:37,590
You're gonna learn that the king has a 70% chain throw.

277
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:38,030
You're gonna learn that the king has a 70% chain throw.

278
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:40,210
We'll teach you that for the second and third one.

279
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:40,490
We'll teach you that for the second and third one.

280
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,390
They probably won't know how to break.

281
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:43,150
Like in game.

282
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,250
We should teach them that.

283
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,050
Get ready for the next battle.

284
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,810
Tony, I saw you on your little ass alt stream last night.

285
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:52,230
Yeah, what are you doing lurking in my side stream?

286
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,510
I linked them, dude.

287
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:53,950
My bad.

288
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:57,430
I didn't know you had a little team that has little ass stream.

289
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:58,090
I didn't know you had a little team that has little ass stream.

290
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,210
Little ass no cam.

291
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:03,150
I need to do a gameplay side stream where my viewers go half.

292
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:06,050
You can't play Tekken on the real stream.

293
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:06,990
Wait, I don't understand.

294
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,550
The link is up for the lobby?

295
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:11,730
I mean, I made one.

296
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:12,990
I don't know if they wanted me to.

297
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,930
But you said that I should.

298
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:15,750
So, I did.

299
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,770
Check the stage 3 chat.

300
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,450
They asked you to.

301
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:20,090
Okay.

302
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:24,970
Oh, it's in the fucking chat.

303
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:25,410
I'm stupid.

304
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,190
Hopefully I did it correctly.

305
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,570
I'm gonna play one quick match and then join after it.

306
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,190
Cause I'm poor at seed.

307
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,670
Maybe I should just play Eddy.

308
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:40,230
Match 3.

309
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:42,170
I promise you it'll get us through this first round.

310
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,610
Nobody trained for Eddy, right?

311
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,770
It says I need a passcode?

312
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,290
It's 0009.

313
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,570
Alright, now you just stole the whole stream.

314
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,370
So, fuck.

315
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,590
Come on, everybody in.

316
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:01,610
Come on, everybody in.

317
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,090
They don't have the link.

318
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,790
Join it up and pretend to be me so I don't have to play.

319
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,270
Wait, wait.

320
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,670
I did it wrong, guys.

321
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:14,470
I made it wrong.

322
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:18,570
That's cause you're 40 years old, man.

323
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:19,650
That's cause you're 40 years old, man.

324
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,030
You're older than I am.

325
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,390
I like what you said the other day.

326
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:27,190
The other day it's like my nephew who is older than me.

327
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:29,790
Hold on.

328
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,510
I'm telling them I didn't make categories.

329
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,170
Is that okay?

330
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:38,650
Alright, I can remake it dude.

331
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:39,490
I can remake it.

332
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,480
Not my chat is making fun of me.

333
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,320
Oh my god this is going to be a horrible day.

334
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,820
The average age of this Tekken team is 46.

335
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,260
Wait, what?

336
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,060
Youtubers are young forever.

337
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,160
So maybe like 5?

338
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,100
So I'll bring down the average, don't worry.

339
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:32,560
Together, assembled, we are a young spry 22 year old.

340
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,280
Oh my gosh, we can go to bars!

341
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,360
Yeah, for the first time.

342
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,600
Oh my god!

343
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,440
We won't get carded!

344
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,120
Wow, they're getting right into this, huh?

345
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,500
Yeah, we're just going to go I guess.

346
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,780
Wait, you guys are in the lobby now?

347
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,020
Wait, I'm not in there.

348
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:54,360
Wait!

349
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,960
Wait, I'm fucking in a quick thing!

350
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,080
Don't worry, I'll die soon.

351
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,260
I'm going to get destroyed.

352
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,080
My lobbies are just broken.

353
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,100
I don't know.

354
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,680
It's just not...

355
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,100
It's just not...

356
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,780
Okay, someone else needs to make it.

357
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,880
Did we really let MYK do it?

358
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:09,800
Yeah.

359
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,480
The smarter person.

360
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,800
I mean, but he lost.

361
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,080
He lost!

362
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,420
Maybe he was overthinking.

363
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,720
Maybe he was overthinking.

364
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,040
Oh!

365
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,500
He's so smart and you're so dumb.

366
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,160
True.

367
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,040
I didn't say all of that.

368
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,060
How the fuck does my game say online mode unavailable?

369
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,240
This is like the worst timing.

370
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:31,600
Hold on.

371
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,480
I know you're coming in.

372
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,900
I know you're coming in.

373
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:38,620
I know they were doing some maintenance stuff last night because I was playing and they were just...

374
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,880
You guys know.

375
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,460
It was like...

376
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:45,540
No, that happens to everyone occasionally where it'll kick you off like that.

377
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,260
Oh.

378
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,400
Yeah, for some reason.

379
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,960
I had to be in school today.

380
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,160
Dude, that was smart.

381
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,540
I'm in my mid-thirties.

382
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,540
I haven't done long division in half my life.

383
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:07,600
What's up?

384
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,980
So, anyone else threw up due to nerves or is that just me?

385
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:16,760
I know how bad I'm gonna do so I'm not nervous at all.

386
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,260
Wait, why is my PC not working?

387
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,020
I think I gotta like restart my PC or something.

388
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,720
My online mode is not working.

389
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,020
I know my place.

390
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:27,720
Can you just restart again?

391
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,500
I did just now.

392
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,580
Get ready for the next battle.

393
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,660
Oh, I think I was offline on Steam for some reason.

394
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,080
I'll try again.

395
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:41,270
How do I join the lobby?

396
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:46,510
So, do you see that link in the stage 3 event?

397
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:47,370
Yeah.

398
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,810
Just post that on your browser.

399
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,070
I have a browser?

400
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,910
Oh, on my Steam?

401
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:57,290
What did you think I meant?

402
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:02,090
I was like, oh my god, Tekken has browsers I can just post it in?

403
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,590
I'm gonna restart my PC.

404
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:07,530
Like a Chrome in Tekken.

405
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:08,010
I feel that.

406
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:09,910
I was like, oh my god.

407
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:10,650
I just got Tekken Chrome.

408
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,710
Oh, this really is the blunt rotation group.

409
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,510
That's how we described this.

410
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:20,670
Now I know what it means.

411
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,490
I think we got a strong blunt rotation.

412
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,270
How do I paste this?

413
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:31,890
Guys, give me a second.

414
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:39,330
Just paste it in the URL.

415
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,170
I think.

416
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,210
Oh, I pasted the wrong one.

417
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:48,650
Sorry.

418
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:52,130
Okay.

419
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:55,190
We're gonna get DQ'd if you guys keep this up.

420
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:56,270
Oh my god.

421
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,710
I'm trying to figure it out.

422
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,710
Coach, I did the right thing.

423
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:00,050
Coach.

424
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:01,850
How to paste.

425
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:07,490
Control V, I think.

426
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:09,390
I can just copy.

427
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,350
Should I?

428
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,350
Who's up first?

429
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:19,770
Is it?

430
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:20,590
It's a Doki, right?

431
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:21,150
It's Doki.

432
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:21,730
It's me.

433
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,390
It both left me.

434
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:24,010
I'm trying.

435
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:25,050
I'm launching.

436
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,110
I swear.

437
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,370
I swear to god.

438
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:29,290
Okay, I'm in.

439
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,130
I'm in.

440
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:31,530
We made it.

441
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,650
I did it.

442
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:34,850
I swear to god.

443
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:36,130
It took me so long.

444
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:36,490
I swear to god.

445
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,670
Let's fucking go.

446
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,110
Can I restart my PC?

447
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:41,490
Hello?

448
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:45,650
Matt's PC is dying.

449
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,730
I've lost my anchor.

450
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:47,650
No, bro.

451
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:48,150
No, no, no.

452
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:48,790
I just don't know.

453
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:50,850
It won't connect to online the moment I launch.

454
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:52,250
It says online is unavailable.

455
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:52,970
Oh.

456
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,470
Oh, it's good.

457
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:54,750
It's good.

458
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:56,490
Oh, everybody is.

459
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:58,870
Everything is going wrong.

460
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:00,870
It's fine.

461
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,690
I gotta use the bathroom.

462
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:03,330
Oh my god.

463
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:04,230
No, don't leave me here.

464
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:09,950
Okay, but what if I just go Eddie?

465
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,210
Do it against Gummy.

466
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:15,290
Do it.

467
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:15,970
Do it.

468
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:16,270
Do it.

469
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:17,310
Do it.

470
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,950
What if I just go Eddie?

471
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,900
She won't know what to do.

472
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,120
How do I stay in the right side?

473
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:33,620
What do I press?

474
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,100
Toggle stay.

475
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:35,500
J?

476
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,400
Why is it J?

477
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,920
Why can't I ready up?

478
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,580
Click on your screen.

479
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,460
Maybe you're like tabbed out or something.

480
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:44,960
No.

481
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,780
Oh my god.

482
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,560
This is...

483
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,200
This is so much.

484
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,200
I can't even ready up.

485
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,400
You hit the left kick button to ready up.

486
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,400
Hell yeah.

487
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,440
Well, it's now Keishin.

488
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:05,900
Hello.

489
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,680
Why am I downloading?

490
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,020
I don't want to download.

491
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,300
Oh.

492
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,400
There you go.

493
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,260
I accidentally was on the chat screen.

494
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,020
That's why.

495
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,300
Let's go.

496
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,120
Lobby created.

497
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:18,940
Okay.

498
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:19,880
We did it.

499
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,260
The first hurdle is done.

500
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,480
Okay.

501
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,520
Do I do it?

502
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,080
Do I pull out the King... the Eddie?

503
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,720
That's the kind of beast mode.

504
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,900
Hit her with the 3 Eddie.

505
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:33,840
Yeah.

506
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,660
Let's see.

507
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,780
Let's see if she learned how to play against Eddie.

508
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,760
That's so great.

509
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,620
Get ready for the next battle.

510
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:49,610
You got this.

511
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:52,370
Well, I only know one move on him.

512
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,770
That's all you need.

513
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:54,890
That's all you need.

514
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:56,070
That's all you need.

515
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,250
That's all you need.

516
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:59,210
And all your ancestors.

517
00:22:59,510 --> 00:22:59,930
Oh, here.

518
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:00,670
Hit the theme song.

519
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,710
Play number one.

520
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:04,510
You know how to rage her.

521
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,010
Oh, no.

522
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:05,410
She knows how to rage her.

523
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:05,670
Oh, no.

524
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:06,330
She knows.

525
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,650
She figured it out.

526
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:08,830
How?

527
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:13,670
Yo, is anyone else streaming this?

528
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:14,950
It says I'm unable to speak.

529
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:16,590
I'm streaming it.

530
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:17,850
Oh, shit.

531
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:18,950
She's a better streamer than me.

532
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:19,530
I'm a YouTuber.

533
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:19,850
Alright.

534
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:21,090
Let's watch.

535
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:23,090
Oh, my gosh.

536
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:25,130
She actually fucking think count.

537
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:28,730
Learned the Eddie calendar after I fucked with her.

538
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,830
I actually don't know this character, you know.

539
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:33,390
Boom.

540
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:33,630
Boom.

541
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:34,130
Boom.

542
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:34,490
Boom.

543
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:35,450
3-3-3.

544
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:35,910
It's real.

545
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:37,270
3 -3-3.

546
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,470
Do it for the boys at Brio.

547
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:41,670
Yeah.

548
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,430
There we go.

549
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:48,250
Do it again.

550
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:48,650
Do it again.

551
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:49,150
Bazinga.

552
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,450
Level two Bazinga?

553
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:52,850
What the fuck is going on?

554
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:53,870
I don't know.

555
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:55,230
I lost track of him.

556
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,170
Hey, drop her.

557
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:59,270
Oh, God.

558
00:23:59,370 --> 00:23:59,710
Oh, no.

559
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:03,230
How am I supposed to do the Eddie's if she juggles me?

560
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:05,750
Nice try, nice try.

561
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:08,990
Oh, you just hit the three button.

562
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:10,850
The three button?

563
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:11,770
Yeah, the three button right there.

564
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,150
Yeah, like that!

565
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,610
I mean, Cody might be in.

566
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:16,010
Cody might be in.

567
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:17,450
Oh my gosh.

568
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,310
Where's our life at?

569
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:27,250
We all saw the 30 button, it worked all the way up until, what, like, Red Rex?

570
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:28,990
Because Orange, it'll work.

571
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,010
Oh my gosh!

572
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:30,730
I'm gonna die again!

573
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:32,290
Let's go!

574
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:37,430
My read for you is you walk up and you press three.

575
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:39,330
Okay, okay, I got it, I got it, I got it.

576
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,070
Don't worry, I got it.

577
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:43,070
Get that third button off the controller.

578
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,890
Oh, she's blocking my...

579
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:45,890
No!

580
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:50,070
Oh my god!

581
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,130
That's a dev tip.

582
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:54,430
That's a developer difference.

583
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:55,570
That's not fair at all.

584
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:56,370
That's not fair!

585
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,110
She's hacking!

586
00:24:58,990 --> 00:24:59,870
That's not fair!

587
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:01,890
That's Hirata's fault.

588
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:07,930
Let me just say, punishing a flash with a rage art is the most next level shit ever.

589
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:09,510
Oh, mate.

590
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:10,630
Unironic.

591
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,230
Wait, how do I swap characters?

592
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:13,410
How do I do it?

593
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:14,350
Oh, fuck.

594
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:21,610
I'll be like, sorry, I picked the wrong character.

595
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,270
Raven has a one frame counter.

596
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:25,070
Sorry, picked the wrong character.

597
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,550
Picked the wrong character.

598
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:26,890
I didn't know.

599
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:28,490
Sorry, wrong input.

600
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:28,930
It's not as...

601
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:32,410
Picked the wrong character.

602
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:35,570
Slime, you gotta sit on the sides, brother.

603
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,010
We have, um...

604
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:39,890
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

605
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:42,270
Oh, me too, me too, me too.

606
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,150
My bad, my bad, my bad.

607
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:45,010
Everybody's trying to get in.

608
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:46,130
It's just weird.

609
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:46,990
Slime is coming in.

610
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:48,550
Yeah.

611
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:51,690
Big bro's gonna handle this one.

612
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,130
Step aside.

613
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:55,850
Pass the controller.

614
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,430
It's okay, let me call somebody real quick.

615
00:25:58,690 --> 00:25:59,690
I said it's my turn.

616
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:01,010
She's a phone-a-friend.

617
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,390
Phone-a-friend.

618
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:04,010
King.

619
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,440
Get ready for the next battle.

620
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,700
I won't be surprised if I do worse.

621
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,260
No.

622
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,700
Because I have to actually think.

623
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:27,240
I don't see that happening.

624
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,320
This is like warming up before working out.

625
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,500
That's true, that's true.

626
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,660
The idea was just to warm up and now we're gonna hit PR.

627
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,700
That's true.

628
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,680
That thing is so cute.

629
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,920
What the fuck is that?

630
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,780
What the fuck is she doing with that little...

631
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,300
Getting very dizzy.

632
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:49,960
Oh shit.

633
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,060
Yup, that's a duck.

634
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,680
Oh no, she ducks!

635
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,720
I can't believe it.

636
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,020
It's like she knows she's playing good for her.

637
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,400
That's the king!

638
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,560
Round two.

639
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,780
You gotta throw your best mids.

640
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:09,720
Oh god.

641
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:16,390
Oh my god, she's so fast!

642
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:19,010
I think the armor runs out.

643
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:21,330
Oh my god.

644
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:22,430
She ducks everything.

645
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,710
Her ass is holding down.

646
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:28,710
Oh, that's fun!

647
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,130
That's right, that's right.

648
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:35,830
That's right, that's right.

649
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,190
I'm gonna teach you so many good mids.

650
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,490
Yeah, for tomorrow.

651
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:40,830
Yeah, watch this.

652
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,170
This is all...

653
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:46,290
We're just throwing because we all know this one doesn't matter.

654
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:47,610
That's true, that's true.

655
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:48,950
That's true.

656
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,810
It's too early for this for me.

657
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:53,330
Wait.

658
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:56,190
My hands are definitely not warmed up.

659
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:57,830
It's too early.

660
00:27:58,170 --> 00:27:58,970
That was counter hit.

661
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:01,370
Oh my god, A!

662
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:04,810
Oh no, not the smith!

663
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:05,750
Not the smith!

664
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:06,090
I'm in!

665
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:08,110
You're in!

666
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,430
It's not really fair though.

667
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:13,350
She did have a sword.

668
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:14,110
You know what I'm saying?

669
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:15,370
That's true, that's true.

670
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:17,350
Why would you bring a sword to a fist fight?

671
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:18,090
Or a baguette.

672
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:19,810
That's not fair.

673
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:20,810
That's true.

674
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:23,070
Is it all best of five?

675
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:26,810
I think it's first to two like last time.

676
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:29,890
It's just a round robin so it shouldn't be too long.

677
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,050
Right, right.

678
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:34,390
You said pick the wrong character.

679
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:35,110
I just saw that.

680
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:40,290
I'm just gonna pick the one I like.

681
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:41,110
Yo, I gotta take a leak.

682
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:42,170
I'll be right back.

683
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:42,950
Oh my god, finally.

684
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:44,130
I can chill now.

685
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,470
For like 15 minutes maybe.

686
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,550
I don't have to do anything.

687
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:49,570
Yay!

688
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:54,790
Toggle.

689
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:59,430
I'm just gonna do a king mirror.

690
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:00,870
King mirror.

691
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:02,990
You're actually...

692
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:05,010
Wait, what's this person you're playing ranked?

693
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:06,730
Uh...

694
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:07,130
Purple.

695
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:09,010
Same rank.

696
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:11,510
You just have so many years, Kony.

697
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,210
That's the thing.

698
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:14,690
He has more years than me.

699
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:15,490
You gotta understand.

700
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:17,530
As old as I am, it's James Chen, bro.

701
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:19,350
Wait, this is...

702
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,470
You're playing James Chen?

703
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:23,290
He has more years than I could dream of.

704
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:24,710
You're playing SuckMyNutsAsshole's James Chen?

705
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:26,770
Yes, it's that guy.

706
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:27,570
It's the guy.

707
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:28,350
Oh my god.

708
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,230
I don't like that.

709
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:31,570
The James Chen.

710
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:32,750
Not me neither.

711
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,750
But that's the hand we're dealt.

712
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,450
The matchups are hard this one.

713
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:40,450
I believe in you.

714
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:41,790
Do I pick random stage?

715
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,750
I don't know how stage works here.

716
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:45,870
I think you're supposed to pick random.

717
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:48,710
That's what I did the entire time.

718
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:50,250
It's like in the rules that are really fucked.

719
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:54,370
How about the farm another James Chen clip like the last one?

720
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:55,490
How about the farm another James Chen clip like the last one?

721
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:56,770
Just...

722
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:58,870
If I can make him do that again, we're good.

723
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,740
Oh my god, he's a cowboy.

724
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,500
He is.

725
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,480
This is the... it's a star is born king.

726
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,360
I don't know which king is which.

727
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,920
Which one is king?

728
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:22,900
Our guy is a cowboy.

729
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,940
Let's go cowboy.

730
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,040
Oh!

731
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,100
This is a real king match.

732
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,480
Yippee!

733
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:45,920
Let's go.

734
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,440
I tried to duck it.

735
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,280
Oops.

736
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,520
No, I'm trying to do this.

737
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,160
Genius block.

738
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:03,700
There we go.

739
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,340
Yeah, the knee bash.

740
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:06,880
Hell yeah.

741
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:07,760
Oh!

742
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:09,880
Yup.

743
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,320
Oh my god.

744
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,380
I can tell that you actually know what you're doing.

745
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,960
Mmm, okay.

746
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,380
That's a nice round start.

747
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:31,880
It's a good gimmick.

748
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,120
I Atlas have.

749
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,700
I have never jacked round start all the time.

750
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:35,820
Yeah.

751
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,060
That shit is fucking nice actually.

752
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:49,190
Boom!

753
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:50,570
Okay.

754
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:51,390
You know what?

755
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:51,990
I should pick up king.

756
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:52,990
That's cool.

757
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:55,970
Yeah, we should all end up playing king in the end.

758
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:56,810
The final is...

759
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:58,450
I'll play king.

760
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:02,430
We all just bring out the king.

761
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:04,150
I'd be so down.

762
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:05,110
Fucking go.

763
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,170
Let's fucking go.

764
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:07,270
Good shit.

765
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,070
Round four.

766
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:10,590
Fight!

767
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:12,790
Oh!

768
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,090
That counter hit was sick.

769
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:18,380
Boom!

770
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:19,320
Okay.

771
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,280
Alright, I got it.

772
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:21,660
I got it.

773
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,000
I got it.

774
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,340
You're my fucking goat.

775
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,180
You know that shit?

776
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:25,880
Whoa!

777
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:30,660
After the knee pony, he's always like crouch jabbing every time.

778
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

779
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,060
He's scared of that grab.

780
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:32,640
Boom!

781
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,420
Hop kick.

782
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,280
You're right.

783
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:34,520
Yeah.

784
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,640
Yeah, knee hop kick for a free combo.

785
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,240
This one.

786
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:37,820
Next one.

787
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:39,820
Ah!

788
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,320
That was supposed to be what he did, but I did the shoulder because I didn't get the neutral.

789
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,020
Mmm!

790
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,240
Oh no.

791
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:48,920
That was...

792
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,680
That was so much damage.

793
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:56,420
Okay.

794
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,080
Okay.

795
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:02,540
Okay.

796
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,220
Yeehaw!

797
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:03,980
Yee-haw!

798
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,360
I got it.

799
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:05,820
I got it.

800
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:06,220
I got it.

801
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,100
Round two.

802
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,060
Double low.

803
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:09,560
That's crazy.

804
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,600
Oh, we gotta be here a little faster.

805
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,340
Just a little bit.

806
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:17,380
Yeah, just pretend that's my king in three days.

807
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,080
I believe.

808
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:23,080
Alright, he doesn't block this, but he does block the next one, which means we grab.

809
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:23,920
Oh my god!

810
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,420
He didn't.

811
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:24,900
Okay, whatever.

812
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,260
Alright, take the ground.

813
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:26,800
Okay.

814
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:31,520
Yeah.

815
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,340
Yeah.

816
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,920
I keep getting that.

817
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:42,290
I tried to duck, but I got locked in.

818
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:42,430
I'm trying to duck, but I got locked in.

819
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:44,070
At the fucking mirror.

820
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:53,770
He's so scared of you.

821
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:54,410
Yeah.

822
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,140
He's so scared of you.

823
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:01,980
He's dead.

824
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,460
God, you're fucking nice with it, man.

825
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:04,900
I got it.

826
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,340
I got it.

827
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:05,780
I got it.

828
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:06,940
Let's go.

829
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,040
Let's go.

830
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:11,080
Do not doubt the goat.

831
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:12,720
I'm confident.

832
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,160
Okay.

833
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,920
Dude, that round start launcher, I'm gonna steal that.

834
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,020
That shit was...

835
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,960
That's a really good fucking up and down.

836
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:19,960
Yeah.

837
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:19,960
Yeah.

838
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:20,980
That's really unsafe, though.

839
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,020
You can hop kick it if you block it.

840
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:26,180
If I pop that one round at six or nine, I'm cool with it.

841
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:26,700
You know what I mean?

842
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:28,820
I do that on ranked every single day of my life.

843
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,200
One half this hammer per rank.

844
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,120
Round start.

845
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:33,660
It's really strong.

846
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,240
I mean, it's gonna crush any highs and shit, you know?

847
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,980
Yeah, and they won't expect it.

848
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,660
Because you didn't pull it out before.

849
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:40,960
Exactly.

850
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:41,700
Just for the one time.

851
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,220
Whoops.

852
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:49,990
Who's next?

853
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:54,450
Should be Slime versus Fission, I think.

854
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,070
Alright.

855
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:56,950
It's my turn, right?

856
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:59,710
James Chen has some words for you.

857
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:01,210
Did he just tweet this?

858
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:03,130
Suck my nuts at dude.

859
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:03,830
What the fuck?

860
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:04,490
It's a fun game.

861
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:05,650
Frame one.

862
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,950
What the fuck is his problem, man?

863
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:09,370
That's my goat.

864
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:10,930
Okay.

865
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,170
Why'd he say assholes?

866
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:13,450
I was the one that beat...

867
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:13,590
What?

868
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:19,190
Can I get a link to that?

869
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:21,230
Do you not know the tweet?

870
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,610
If you look...

871
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:28,610
If you search James Chen suck my nuts assholes and go through the timeline Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

872
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:29,730
It's very beautiful.

873
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:33,590
I feel like if you just search James Chen tweet, it'll come up.

874
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:34,790
Like, that's his legacy.

875
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:35,590
You know what I mean?

876
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,190
Am I ready to start?

877
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:43,090
Doki, you have to hit the right trigger.

878
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,390
Hit the rage art button.

879
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:45,550
Rage art button?

880
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:46,170
Oh, okay.

881
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:48,630
See, that's...

882
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,050
I mean... Oh, why am I not on the game?

883
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:51,630
Coach Matthew.

884
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:52,450
Let's go.

885
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:56,710
I was like, why am I always back in the game?

886
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:58,230
Here we go.

887
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:00,630
Damn, this guy's a Tekken king.

888
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:01,490
What happened?

889
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:02,930
What's going on?

890
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:03,910
Wait, he's Tekken king?

891
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:04,650
How?

892
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:05,430
Why?

893
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:07,170
I didn't know about this.

894
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:08,430
I'm afraid about it.

895
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:13,910
Remember, Slime, I had to beat an Azu Sinne to get God of Destruction on Kuma, so...

896
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:14,910
You got this.

897
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:16,170
It's very doable.

898
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,550
Why the fuck is their fourth seed lower?

899
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,690
They're ranked in the third seed.

900
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:21,770
No, dude.

901
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:24,770
Also, I can't spectate any of these matches.

902
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:25,850
Watch my stream.

903
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:27,890
No, watch my stream.

904
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:28,630
Give me the views.

905
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,250
Okay, give... Oh, yeah.

906
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:30,450
Yeah.

907
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:33,810
I'm not gonna lie.

908
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:36,150
I don't even know how to navigate streams on YouTube.

909
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:37,570
For real.

910
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:41,050
Wait, just press go to Doki Bird's YouTube channel.

911
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:41,470
Wait, she's naked.

912
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:42,290
Stop the match.

913
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:43,150
Oh my goodness.

914
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:44,110
Wait, wait, wait.

915
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:44,810
Not allowed.

916
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:46,750
Put on some clothes, young lady.

917
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:47,970
Oh my gosh.

918
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:49,830
I'm gonna get destroyed here.

919
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:03,290
Damn.

920
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:05,310
Patient.

921
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:06,770
Nice.

922
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:08,330
Lot of block.

923
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,200
That's a double.

924
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:16,880
Nice.

925
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,140
Okay.

926
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,240
I did not prepare this matchup, I'll say it.

927
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,040
Round two.

928
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,300
Okay, we're just not showing them the strats.

929
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:30,900
Exactly.

930
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,780
It's just round robin one.

931
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,080
We still have round robin two.

932
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,420
Nice.

933
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,220
Nice.

934
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,740
It's not guaranteed.

935
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,260
Okay, that's fine.

936
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,760
I thought the butt was guaranteed.

937
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,060
No.

938
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,340
Not after the... It needs to be a higher wall splat.

939
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,780
Break the guitar.

940
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:57,580
I'm sad that her guitar is covering her ass.

941
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,000
I...

942
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,600
I...

943
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,540
The sad day.

944
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:04,060
The sad day.

945
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,000
At least fully commit.

946
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:07,580
At least fully commit.

947
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,140
Good shit.

948
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:11,740
Good shit.

949
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,880
What a hopkick, dude.

950
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,060
He's simply better.

951
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:18,480
Raid right here.

952
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,260
Mish, get the chip.

953
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:20,640
Oh.

954
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,000
Oh.

955
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:22,940
Nah.

956
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:24,580
Yes.

957
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:31,760
Good shit.

958
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,040
Not a rage art.

959
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:34,720
Not a rage art.

960
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:35,860
At least not immediately.

961
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:37,600
Woo!

962
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:42,610
Fight.

963
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:49,890
Good shit.

964
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:53,330
We can take chip.

965
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:53,890
We can bounce.

966
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:57,730
Grab it.

967
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:57,930
Yeah.

968
00:38:58,050 --> 00:38:58,590
Every time.

969
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:02,740
Nice.

970
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,640
She loves that string, huh?

971
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,360
Yeah.

972
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,600
There we go.

973
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,660
Game one, baby.

974
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,000
Dude, lots of grabs.

975
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:09,340
Lots.

976
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:09,960
Because like...

977
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,980
She's scared of you.

978
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:11,540
Not breaking them.

979
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,240
Yeah.

980
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,380
Just keep feasting, bro.

981
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,440
Feast.

982
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:20,860
Good shit.

983
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,420
I gotta restart my game.

984
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,140
She might adapt.

985
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,580
Round one.

986
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,920
Oh, I gotta go get a... for a coach interview.

987
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,000
A coach interview?

988
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,280
Come on.

989
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:34,180
Alright.

990
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,120
I'll be back.

991
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:40,490
Good shit.

992
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:43,810
We have damage.

993
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,660
I always grab it with the health sweep.

994
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,420
It's a little predictable.

995
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:01,580
She didn't let go on that.

996
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:02,960
Nice.

997
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,480
Don't worry about...

998
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,320
Don't overthink it.

999
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,420
Because like...

1000
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,380
I don't know if they're at that level yet.

1001
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,840
She is starting to break grabs though.

1002
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:20,420
Good shit.

1003
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:21,420
Nice.

1004
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,120
I like the idea.

1005
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,120
Love that string.

1006
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:25,480
Geez.

1007
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,500
Alright, I'm gonna do five.

1008
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,560
Oh, power crush does beat that.

1009
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:29,060
She's cool.

1010
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:30,340
Nice.

1011
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,200
Copy pressing.

1012
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,120
Appreciate it.

1013
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,260
That's a punish.

1014
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,200
Oh, jeez.

1015
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,900
There we go.

1016
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,720
Good shit.

1017
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:40,980
Yes!

1018
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:42,780
Big, big, big.

1019
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,820
Just purely big.

1020
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,420
That's all it is.

1021
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,700
You're reading his mind!

1022
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:47,860
Good shit.

1023
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:51,880
I like the idea.

1024
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,420
She's giving you all the space in the world, dude.

1025
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,360
Good break.

1026
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,040
I just keep power crushing.

1027
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,020
It's gonna work sometimes.

1028
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,580
Yeah, the damage is worth it.

1029
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,180
Good shit.

1030
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:14,900
Oh my god.

1031
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,060
I'm gonna wake up right here.

1032
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:16,540
It'll work.

1033
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:18,880
I think I get this.

1034
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,040
I think you get this.

1035
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:20,800
Yes!

1036
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,180
You get it?

1037
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:21,880
Yes!

1038
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:27,800
Is this ever explained in lore or do we just still not know?

1039
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:29,460
Oh man.

1040
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,700
It's just a fish that's a missile.

1041
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:32,500
Understood.

1042
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:32,920
My fault.

1043
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,040
Those are in the wilderness.

1044
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,540
It's just a bear with a fish missile.

1045
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,360
How is that launch?

1046
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:40,080
What happened?

1047
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,320
That's a weird launcher.

1048
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,540
It doesn't even look like a counter.

1049
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:48,850
Nice job.

1050
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:49,430
I'm getting destroyed.

1051
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:51,950
It's okay.

1052
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,630
We just wanted to get it close, you know?

1053
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:57,170
A lot of skins.

1054
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:00,850
Matterhorn?

1055
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:01,590
Oh, it doesn't work.

1056
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:01,810
I'm dead.

1057
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:03,530
That's fair.

1058
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:05,110
It's alright.

1059
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:06,710
It's alright.

1060
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:07,970
It's just the anticipation.

1061
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:09,290
I'm power crushing!

1062
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,380
Oh, I got fucked up, man.

1063
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,920
Oh, I had it.

1064
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:26,860
It's one round.

1065
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:27,320
It's all good.

1066
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,060
Shit.

1067
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:31,940
I don't know what I'm doing.

1068
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,460
Not eating... She's not eating the power crushers anymore.

1069
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,160
I think I gotta have a better mix-up game off of the coin bear stance.

1070
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:47,080
Sorry,

1071
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:51,800
I'm just so delayed.

1072
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:52,620
I apologize.

1073
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:02,740
We got a circle.

1074
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:02,740
Nice.

1075
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,640
Oh, nice hit!

1076
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:05,600
Good shit.

1077
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:05,980
Yeah!

1078
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,340
Two more big dog.

1079
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:10,960
Got this.

1080
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,160
She read me there.

1081
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:13,740
Ah, fuck.

1082
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:15,020
It's fine.

1083
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,040
We're gonna get that back.

1084
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:42,780
Ah!

1085
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:43,640
I keep getting...

1086
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:47,160
Just... lots of jèmes.

1087
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:50,000
When you get in heat slime you can grab her or something.

1088
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,180
Because he is just holding back.

1089
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,260
It's a bare electric.

1090
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:59,640
He is doing very good at playing outside grab range now.

1091
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,440
Let's f***ing go dude!

1092
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:43,410
Nice hit.

1093
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:53,420
Wait for the whiff here.

1094
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,240
Move!

1095
00:44:58,460 --> 00:44:59,780
I don't know what she is doing to me.

1096
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:04,340
She is showing all the cards out now.

1097
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,660
I think I punish this.

1098
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:11,680
Let's f***ing go!

1099
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:12,220
Yes!

1100
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:13,500
Wow!

1101
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:15,400
That was an intense match.

1102
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:17,380
That was such a good game.

1103
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:17,540
Good f***ing game.

1104
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:18,380
Nice hit.

1105
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:18,960
You're better!

1106
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:21,860
Oh my god, that was so hard.

1107
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:25,680
That guy was very good at playing outside grab range.

1108
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:27,100
Like, that was really good spacing.

1109
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:29,440
He adapted, that's why it was so scary.

1110
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:30,080
Yeah.

1111
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:30,540
He's not free.

1112
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,520
Yeah, but he showed off the most dirty of his moves today.

1113
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:37,240
Well yeah, we got extreme downloads happening right now.

1114
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:38,160
Good shit, dude.

1115
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:38,720
Let's go home!

1116
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:40,920
I think you got more info there than he did.

1117
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:42,360
Like, straight up.

1118
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:47,560
If we're talking about reviewing sets, because he's on his back foot the whole set.

1119
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:52,360
Like, you're constantly aggressing and pushing, and he's just, like, in reverse, you know?

1120
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,000
Yeah.

1121
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,500
Now we just get to watch Jack Jesus cook.

1122
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,840
Yeah, now we just sit back and relax.

1123
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:02,780
Now we get to watch him win every round, right?

1124
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:03,500
Yeah, right?

1125
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,000
Let's put all the pressure on him.

1126
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:07,200
Bruh.

1127
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:09,360
My savior.

1128
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:10,680
Clutch your kick.

1129
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:11,900
Bruh.

1130
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,540
Yeah, I don't really want to play.

1131
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,680
So, please win this.

1132
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:20,880
I mean, I have to play anyway.

1133
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,400
You can't do that anymore.

1134
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:24,640
Clutch your kick!

1135
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:25,980
Clutch your kick!

1136
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:26,920
Clutch your kick!

1137
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,120
You can't do that anymore.

1138
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:33,640
No, dude, that tiebreaker was so fucked up for my mental.

1139
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:35,760
I've never been under so much pressure.

1140
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,180
Lay awake at night.

1141
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,600
What the fuck is this Skara skin?

1142
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:40,580
It's so ugly!

1143
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,760
It's there to distract you of how ugly it is.

1144
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,920
No, that's the Odd Future Supreme job, bro.

1145
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:47,540
That's the Odd Future Supreme job, bro.

1146
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:49,000
I'm dressed like a 50-year-old YouTuber.

1147
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,600
This is such a strange... you know what I mean?

1148
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:56,460
Like a guy who's like trying to exploit the algo, you know?

1149
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:56,940
Like...

1150
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:00,500
He's got his kids singing songs.

1151
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:01,520
You break throws?

1152
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:02,240
I break throws!

1153
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:02,480
I break throws!

1154
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:04,940
Let's go.

1155
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:08,340
Hey-oh.

1156
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,060
I didn't do that to be honest with you, but you know.

1157
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:10,980
But it works.

1158
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:13,720
That ship is crazy.

1159
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:15,920
Bruh, still.

1160
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:16,920
Oh my god, what a...

1161
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,080
Oh my god.

1162
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:19,000
Count for me, Jack.

1163
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:19,820
Count for me.

1164
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,520
I forgot how to count, bro.

1165
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:22,680
Let's go!

1166
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:24,240
Let's hit that thing.

1167
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:26,620
I thought that would work, but I guess not.

1168
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:27,240
No way he doesn't.

1169
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,680
Oh, he knows Skara.

1170
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:29,660
Good to know.

1171
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:30,300
Good to know.

1172
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:30,740
Good to know.

1173
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:31,540
That's all I need to know.

1174
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:39,170
Nice launch.

1175
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:41,110
Stop that nonsense, dude.

1176
00:47:42,890 --> 00:47:43,790
That's one of the sins.

1177
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:45,550
Woo!

1178
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:45,850
I'm back!

1179
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:46,470
I'm back!

1180
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:47,750
I'm back!

1181
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:49,630
Uh-oh.

1182
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:50,390
You're chasing it down!

1183
00:47:50,850 --> 00:47:51,510
Oh my god.

1184
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:52,390
Oh my god.

1185
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:53,330
Nice!

1186
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:54,390
Oh!

1187
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:55,770
Got him back!

1188
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:58,130
Drop the satellite!

1189
00:47:58,870 --> 00:47:59,470
Yeah!

1190
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:02,970
Stab you in the foot.

1191
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:04,290
Drop the satellite.

1192
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:06,210
Drop the satellite.

1193
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:07,750
Oh, fuck.

1194
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:09,710
He doesn't even wear shoes.

1195
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:12,450
Oh, man.

1196
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:14,970
I'm so sorry.

1197
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:15,530
I'm so sorry.

1198
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:16,290
Skara got pretty good.

1199
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:16,690
What the fuck?

1200
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:17,250
I know, right?

1201
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:17,830
That's what I'm saying.

1202
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:19,630
I swear to god it's not me.

1203
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:20,270
He's actually good.

1204
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:21,330
Oh, just Viktor.

1205
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:21,730
Woo!

1206
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:22,570
Yes!

1207
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:23,050
Nice!

1208
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:24,010
Viktor Gamma House.

1209
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:26,650
People actually improving?

1210
00:48:27,090 --> 00:48:27,730
No way.

1211
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:32,690
They're supposed to stay at the level they are.

1212
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:33,990
Oh my god.

1213
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:34,350
No!

1214
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:35,810
You contended.

1215
00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:37,370
You have it.

1216
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:39,470
I thought we were friends.

1217
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:40,610
You're continuing the string.

1218
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:41,490
Oh!

1219
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:42,150
Oh!

1220
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:43,550
No.

1221
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:45,510
I'm so sorry.

1222
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:46,650
That's all right.

1223
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:47,330
That's all right.

1224
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:48,310
Don't stress it.

1225
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:48,750
That string is too long.

1226
00:48:51,830 --> 00:48:52,430
That's all right.

1227
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:53,570
We're just giving him one.

1228
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:54,210
You know?

1229
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:54,490
Oh.

1230
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:57,790
Nice fucking read on the power crush.

1231
00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:03,950
Every time I think the combo is over, there's another off the ground.

1232
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:06,770
Where did his health go?

1233
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:07,810
Oh.

1234
00:49:09,290 --> 00:49:11,190
That code did not offer any protection.

1235
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:12,950
Get a helmet.

1236
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:15,490
Oh, man.

1237
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:16,210
This is.

1238
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:16,230
I just want to.

1239
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:17,570
Shoot your gun.

1240
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:20,390
A satellite.

1241
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:22,210
Oh that's hitting?

1242
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:22,690
Oh.

1243
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:25,150
So it is ten frames.

1244
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:27,190
Oh.

1245
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:28,210
Be safe!

1246
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:31,390
Oh, my.

1247
00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:32,310
Yes.

1248
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:35,310
Why are you doing that, bro?

1249
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:36,090
Why?

1250
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:37,250
Why are you doing that?

1251
00:49:37,290 --> 00:49:38,210
Don't listen to the coach bro.

1252
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:39,370
You don't know what you're doing.

1253
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:41,410
You don't even make Tekken content.

1254
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:43,070
You can't even upload that anywhere.

1255
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:44,350
I'm sorry.

1256
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:45,090
I'm sorry.

1257
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:45,490
I'm sorry.

1258
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:48,030
He's not even creating content, he likes that move!

1259
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:54,100
Whaaat?

1260
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:58,800
Oh...

1261
00:49:58,800 --> 00:49:59,480
Fuck.

1262
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,040
Bon appetit, bro.

1263
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:10,200
Damn, Skrull.

1264
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,180
Oh my god.

1265
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:13,220
That was too long!

1266
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,860
It never stopped!

1267
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:17,460
I get kinda bored during these combos.

1268
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,540
They're too long- Oh wait!

1269
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,900
No, this one's kinda good actually!

1270
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:20,420
Oh!

1271
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:20,720
Wait!

1272
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,160
This one's kinda hype!

1273
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:24,140
Tekken's back!

1274
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:28,840
Oh, he went to the crest!

1275
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:31,540
Oh man, this is wall.

1276
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:32,960
Are we going all the way?

1277
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:34,540
This is a good ass combo.

1278
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,380
Send him to the emperor!

1279
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:41,320
Take a Michelle Kong, bro!

1280
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:42,480
Bruh.

1281
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,740
Oh my god, he could do a bathroom break with that combo.

1282
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:47,120
Oh, I'm talking about that.

1283
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:47,400
Uh oh.

1284
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,520
Bro, I saw James Chan and was inspired.

1285
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:52,080
Fuck.

1286
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:57,800
Wow.

1287
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,740
What the fuck is that?

1288
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:05,840
What the fuck was that?

1289
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:07,320
It's freaky Jack 8.

1290
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,000
That has to be a new move.

1291
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:09,760
That's a hot patch.

1292
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,500
What if Jack 8, but freaky?

1293
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,880
Oh my god, Matt.

1294
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:16,340
Okie, okie.

1295
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:19,260
Oh shit.

1296
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:19,980
Let's go.

1297
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:21,880
This dude is studying the move list.

1298
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:22,760
What the fuck?

1299
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:25,580
Whoops.

1300
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:30,900
He's bringing his Kre-eeta character into the match.

1301
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:34,140
He's bringing his Kre-eeta character into the match.

1302
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:37,640
Tekken literally add that move just for him.

1303
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:38,820
I hate Tekken players.

1304
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:40,620
What a...

1305
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:41,860
Dude, you're goaded.

1306
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:42,720
That was spacing beautifully.

1307
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:43,140
Beautiful.

1308
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:48,100
Look at that!

1309
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:48,600
He killed it!

1310
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:52,340
Oh wow.

1311
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,260
That's such a good move.

1312
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:56,420
But how long does it go Matt?

1313
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:57,900
How long do we need to hit it?

1314
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:00,460
Surely not more!

1315
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:03,160
Oh no, you're spacing is inspiration.

1316
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:03,900
Really?

1317
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:04,780
One more mix.

1318
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:08,340
Guess for game, Scarra!

1319
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:11,760
Guess for your life!

1320
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:12,980
Guess for your fucking game!

1321
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,180
Let's go dude.

1322
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,060
All hail, all hail.

1323
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:21,940
That was so beautiful.

1324
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:23,720
What a good round of tech.

1325
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:24,580
That was insane.

1326
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,500
What a fucking freak!

1327
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:30,620
He's showing moves none of us have seen before.

1328
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,540
Guess for the fucking game bro.

1329
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:37,260
What was that?

1330
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:40,820
I've never seen that in Tekken.

1331
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:42,000
The what one?

1332
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:42,760
The slider.

1333
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:46,440
The one where you just jumped on top of him.

1334
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:47,920
Oh yeah, you know.

1335
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:50,580
Just buffed up moves that never exist.

1336
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:52,820
I patched the game so I could put those moves in.

1337
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:56,980
You gotta call the devs and add that in.

1338
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:57,120
You gotta call the devs and add that in.

1339
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:57,520
Custom finisher.

1340
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:00,080
I got the Mii Brawler.

1341
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:03,680
Alright.

1342
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:05,700
We got the God's Kingdom clutch.

1343
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:07,660
I mean, we take this easy.

1344
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:08,140
Let's be real.

1345
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:09,840
We beat his ass here coach.

1346
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:12,200
He's good man.

1347
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:13,060
He's good.

1348
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:14,480
You beat him before.

1349
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:16,840
Yeah, what happened?

1350
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:17,680
Where's your confidence?

1351
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,840
Alright, hold on.

1352
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:26,930
That shit still works.

1353
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:27,530
It got a destruction.

1354
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:36,970
That's his default now.

1355
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:38,190
Is it?

1356
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:39,270
Is the cape also?

1357
00:53:39,730 --> 00:53:40,890
My king never looked like that.

1358
00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:43,010
Yeah, my king didn't have that cape.

1359
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:44,450
Oh, you know what?

1360
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:45,370
I think it's Tekken 7.

1361
00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:47,810
Like a...

1362
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:48,350
It's a priest net.

1363
00:53:49,690 --> 00:53:50,050
Bear?

1364
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:04,340
How good is this guy's bear?

1365
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:05,160
I've never seen him.

1366
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:06,960
I've never seen him.

1367
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,600
Is he God of Destruction?

1368
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:09,700
I mean, yeah, he's God.

1369
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:14,960
I think MWIK is like a bunch of characters.

1370
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:16,800
Yeah, Unk has a crazy weird face.

1371
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:18,860
I can learn some shit.

1372
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:20,380
Okay.

1373
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:21,160
Look at that.

1374
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:21,420
Oki.

1375
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:22,020
That's new.

1376
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:23,640
Oh!

1377
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:24,040
Wow.

1378
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:25,860
I've never seen that before.

1379
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:28,200
I think it's guaranteed now after the buffs.

1380
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,080
I actually got a replay though.

1381
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:30,900
That happened to me once.

1382
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:34,160
Why are they showing everything in just round robin one?

1383
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:37,160
Okay, we're getting hit by G-Clust.

1384
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:38,300
Doesn't look good for Unk.

1385
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:41,180
Wow.

1386
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:41,800
Okay.

1387
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:43,620
Slidy ass bear.

1388
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:44,560
What the fuck?

1389
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:45,840
This bear is oiled up.

1390
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:47,560
Roll into...

1391
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:48,300
Nice.

1392
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:51,800
Good adaptation.

1393
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:55,360
Nice.

1394
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:56,220
Nice.

1395
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:04,400
You're not eating any of his bullshit.

1396
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,420
The Dao Bag 2 is on us there.

1397
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:10,920
Nice.

1398
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:20,540
Good shit.

1399
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:24,760
Can I just say something?

1400
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,060
They have Akuma on their team.

1401
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,120
And I beat their Azucena.

1402
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:28,680
Just saying.

1403
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:48,600
Damn it.

1404
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:51,940
He just beat it.

1405
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:52,960
Yeah, he was.

1406
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:55,040
Nice.

1407
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:56,820
Dude, that rolled butt.

1408
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:57,940
Whatever the fuck it is.

1409
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:58,480
That's crazy.

1410
00:55:58,880 --> 00:55:59,720
That's a good move.

1411
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:02,920
Yeah, that's the first time I'm seeing that too.

1412
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:05,000
We're gonna apply that to you, Slime.

1413
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:08,620
Yeah, I feel like in heat, he has even more shit now.

1414
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:09,860
Yeah.

1415
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:12,020
And the chip damage remover.

1416
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:13,160
Whatever the fuck they call it.

1417
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:15,200
How did Akuma do on the last pet?

1418
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:17,300
Akuma got some buffs.

1419
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:18,740
Kanda got even more.

1420
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:31,800
Damn it.

1421
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:32,700
Oh.

1422
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:36,880
I missed a stop.

1423
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:39,100
Mikey's getting his revenge.

1424
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,520
All he had to do was use a bear.

1425
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:43,380
That is crazy.

1426
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:44,040
That is crazy.

1427
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:46,280
Oh, I had never stopped.

1428
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:46,860
Fight.

1429
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,380
That's the thing about Tekken combos.

1430
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,920
I'd just be taking 40.

1431
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:55,260
You know what?

1432
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,240
He showed his hand too early.

1433
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:59,820
We know now of this jutsu.

1434
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:01,280
We know all this shit.

1435
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,200
But then he's gonna play Fang on Friday.

1436
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,360
He got mad characters, bro.

1437
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:08,840
That's not his main?

1438
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:12,240
He mains everyone for some fucking reason.

1439
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:13,060
He mains everyone?

1440
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,400
Ankh's got a couple...

1441
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:17,460
players or characters too.

1442
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,180
We can play Paul for the lore.

1443
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,340
Here we go!

1444
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:22,500
Oh.

1445
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:26,840
Oh, you can't parry that.

1446
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:28,740
I tried to low parry it like an idiot.

1447
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,160
That's not low parryable?

1448
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:30,540
No.

1449
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:33,900
Nice.

1450
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:39,560
We know that.

1451
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:40,620
We see it every time.

1452
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:41,300
We know that.

1453
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:43,700
Bounce.

1454
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:49,340
Nice.

1455
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,320
And we got the leg.

1456
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:52,660
Oh!

1457
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:12,060
Holy shit.

1458
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:14,920
Alright, end this now.

1459
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:15,220
Yeah!

1460
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:17,700
Stop the combos!

1461
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:18,800
It's as simple as that.

1462
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:19,400
You just bring it back.

1463
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:19,640
Easy.

1464
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:22,860
Just hit him.

1465
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:25,240
Oh.

1466
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:39,380
Damn.

1467
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:41,280
Oh, that move's so good.

1468
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:48,760
Oh, nice.

1469
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:50,420
Let's get some life.

1470
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:52,940
Just making it close for the stream.

1471
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:07,150
Oh!

1472
00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:07,710
Oh!

1473
00:59:08,010 --> 00:59:08,670
That was close.

1474
00:59:09,510 --> 00:59:09,950
Nice.

1475
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:13,230
Bear's pretty good.

1476
00:59:13,890 --> 00:59:14,330
Yeah.

1477
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:16,950
Yeah, you saw how that back wall pushed too.

1478
00:59:17,010 --> 00:59:18,290
I couldn't really do anything.

1479
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:18,990
You know what I mean?

1480
00:59:19,150 --> 00:59:19,690
It's okay.

1481
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:22,150
We can use this and give it to slime.

1482
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:23,710
Yeah.

1483
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:24,250
No, this is...

1484
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:25,530
I just gave us info.

1485
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:26,270
Oh, slime info.

1486
00:59:26,290 --> 00:59:27,070
Appreciate it.

1487
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:29,790
Freaking dude.

1488
00:59:29,790 --> 00:59:31,690
Also, we still won more points.

1489
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:32,410
3-2.

1490
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:33,010
We got it.

1491
00:59:33,330 --> 00:59:35,650
Yeah, we went positive on the round.

1492
00:59:36,050 --> 00:59:36,170
Yeah.

1493
00:59:36,350 --> 00:59:37,270
Thanks for the carry.

1494
00:59:37,410 --> 00:59:38,450
Thanks for the carry, guys.

1495
00:59:39,530 --> 00:59:40,590
Thanks for the trip to Eden.

1496
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:44,410
This is like watching your dad lose a fight at the bar.

1497
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:45,550
The moral support, guys.

1498
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:53,740
Is there like an intermission between rounds?

1499
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:55,880
Or do we go straight into the next one?

1500
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:58,220
As far as I know, I guess we can.

1501
00:59:58,240 --> 00:59:59,560
Oh, yeah.

1502
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:00,820
I mean, I don't have the bracket.

1503
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:06,040
Please keep your lobby open.

1504
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:07,140
Are we staying here?

1505
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:09,520
Oh.

1506
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:10,900
Well, we would leave.

1507
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:13,680
Because if we keep the lobby open, then whoever hosted it would stay.

1508
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,300
So, I think we leave no matter what.

1509
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:17,420
Oh, I thought we made it.

1510
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:17,720
Okay.

1511
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:18,380
Hold on.

1512
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:21,420
My chat sent me a clip of James Chen raging against me.

1513
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,100
I gotta go watch that.

1514
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:24,780
I mean, obviously you gotta ego boost every now and then.

1515
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:25,160
Show it to us.

1516
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:26,060
That sounds very fun.

1517
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:26,480
Hold on.

1518
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:27,380
Paste the link.

1519
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,320
Okay, guys.

1520
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:42,260
You guys come in here when you're watching me with absurdly low expectations.

1521
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:44,060
It's in the chat, don't be.

1522
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:49,180
We are the moral support.

1523
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:50,820
We know my place.

1524
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,760
Everybody knows my place here.

1525
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:57,940
I am literally the moral support.

1526
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:00,100
We have the same reaction.

1527
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:02,820
Hahaha.

1528
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:06,460
Okay, I should be leaving the lobby.

1529
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:07,200
Why am I still here?

1530
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:10,100
Uhh, this is the clip.

1531
01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:12,540
I'm glad I am here!

1532
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,980
I am glad to be here.

1533
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:16,860
Hahaha.

1534
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:18,580
Alright, let me see this clip.

1535
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:27,230
Hahahahaha!

1536
01:01:27,590 --> 01:01:28,770
Are you guys speaking...

1537
01:01:30,790 --> 01:01:32,670
Are you guys speaking the clip?

1538
01:01:33,130 --> 01:01:33,750
Yeah, yeah.

1539
01:01:36,890 --> 01:01:38,270
He's just hitting buttons.

1540
01:01:39,690 --> 01:01:40,950
Bro, he was true though.

1541
01:01:41,070 --> 01:01:41,650
He was spitting.

1542
01:01:41,810 --> 01:01:42,810
At that point...

1543
01:01:43,710 --> 01:01:44,590
I've been him.

1544
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:48,170
I was him last night against a Hwoarang and a Lee and a Lars.

1545
01:01:48,290 --> 01:01:48,910
Like, I get it.

1546
01:01:49,010 --> 01:01:49,630
He's right.

1547
01:01:49,770 --> 01:01:51,230
Bro, he's just hitting buttons.

1548
01:01:51,810 --> 01:01:54,770
At that point in the set, I was like, we go shoulder into R1.

1549
01:01:54,890 --> 01:01:55,270
Fuck it.

1550
01:01:55,330 --> 01:01:55,850
We just...

1551
01:01:56,390 --> 01:01:57,410
Just everything out.

1552
01:01:57,450 --> 01:01:58,090
All in on this.

1553
01:02:06,070 --> 01:02:09,910
I shouldn't go into a match in case the lobby goes back up.

1554
01:02:10,870 --> 01:02:14,150
Well, I jumped into rank just to make sure I'm warmed up and stuff.

1555
01:02:15,010 --> 01:02:15,410
True.

1556
01:02:15,530 --> 01:02:16,050
I'm gonna continue.

1557
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:17,590
I'm gonna do a quick match.

1558
01:02:17,890 --> 01:02:19,450
Okay, then I have time then.

1559
01:02:19,550 --> 01:02:21,650
If you're all in a quick match, then I can't be blamed.

1560
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:22,930
Yeah.

1561
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:25,950
We're in it together.

1562
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:28,170
What are you gonna do?

1563
01:02:28,550 --> 01:02:29,250
Disqualify us?

1564
01:02:29,650 --> 01:02:30,710
We cannot do that.

1565
01:02:30,730 --> 01:02:31,670
Full team knocked out.

1566
01:02:31,730 --> 01:02:34,370
Yeah, full team knocked out because we're in quick play.

1567
01:02:38,050 --> 01:02:39,890
So I'd rather be in quick play than this.

1568
01:02:39,910 --> 01:02:40,130
I'm gonna go into the tournament.

1569
01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:41,150
Sorry, guys.

1570
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:54,300
All right, guys.

1571
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:55,180
I'm gonna mask off.

1572
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:56,200
I am so fucked.

1573
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,860
I know how to do combos.

1574
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:01,020
It's probably gonna take a little while.

1575
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:01,680
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

1576
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:06,140
I know how to do combos, but I can't implement it into the game.

1577
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:08,700
Like, I know how to do that.

1578
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:13,820
I don't understand.

1579
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:19,100
Why can't my fingers do this in the real game?

1580
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,460
I do block.

1581
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:31,020
Did he stop panic?

1582
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:32,140
I do.

1583
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:36,880
It's just that I stopped blocking because I was like, I can out hit.

1584
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:39,460
Why is he red rank playing against me?

1585
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:40,920
It's a quick match.

1586
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:54,940
I will show you replays of me doing it.

1587
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:56,260
I swear to God.

1588
01:03:58,740 --> 01:03:59,840
Oh shit, sorry.

1589
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:02,600
Sometimes my hands are in the wrong position too.

1590
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:04,720
I think that's also my issue.

1591
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:05,880
Oh my God, what the fuck?

1592
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:07,440
What are you doing?

1593
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:10,420
Here you go.

1594
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:11,740
Fuck off old man.

1595
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:16,520
I feel like he does that shit and it scares me.

1596
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:22,720
There we go.

1597
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:29,300
No!

1598
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:29,780
Stop!

1599
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:32,360
I just stuck new!

1600
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:37,860
Stop!

1601
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:41,780
No duck.

1602
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:42,660
He ducked.

1603
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:48,320
Oh my God.

1604
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:51,380
It's like he plays this game more than me.

1605
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:55,240
Bro, I have fucking two days of experience on this fucking game.

1606
01:04:55,420 --> 01:04:57,660
If you lose a set from me, you're fucking terrible.

1607
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:02,740
If you lose one round off of me.

1608
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:04,000
You're so bad.

1609
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:11,120
Imagine being red rank and losing at one round from a fucking person who has three days of experience.

1610
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:16,320
What is this play for?

1611
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:24,080
You're so fucking bad.

1612
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:26,340
Imagine being red rank and losing that.

1613
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,240
Oh wait, what the fuck?

1614
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:31,580
Stop staying on the ground and get up!

1615
01:05:32,780 --> 01:05:34,020
What the fuck?

1616
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:35,560
I mean, she's got the play.

1617
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:41,160
Okay.

1618
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:42,260
Goodbye.

1619
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:44,120
I'll never touch you again.

1620
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:45,880
What?

1621
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:47,020
What?

1622
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:55,360
Dude, a lying grappa.

1623
01:05:55,820 --> 01:05:56,460
There.

1624
01:05:56,660 --> 01:05:57,820
You like that grappa?

1625
01:05:58,080 --> 01:05:59,340
Is that what you mean?

1626
01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:00,500
Whoa.

1627
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:04,880
Oh God.

1628
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:08,120
Oh God.

1629
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:09,480
Please let me do this move.

1630
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:09,860
Please!

1631
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:15,500
She's so...

1632
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:16,900
It's a quick match!

1633
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:17,800
Okay.

1634
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:21,880
Okay.

1635
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:24,240
Okay.

1636
01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:26,980
It's fine.

1637
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:28,900
He's red rank.

1638
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:31,340
He's... It's fine!

1639
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:33,120
He's red rank!

1640
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:34,240
Just...

1641
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:42,880
The fact that he lost one round to me when I had three days of Tekken.

1642
01:06:48,260 --> 01:06:49,700
That's the sad part.

1643
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:54,440
I need to like... Okay.

1644
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:57,860
There's like this move that I can never get correct.

1645
01:06:58,460 --> 01:07:00,500
Like the kick.

1646
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:02,480
Like the low kick right here.

1647
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:03,100
Like the kick.

1648
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:03,100
Like the low kick right here.

1649
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:03,600
Please!

1650
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:07,820
The one-two kick!

1651
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,260
Why can't I do it?

1652
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:11,980
Please!

1653
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:12,640
Oh, there you go.

1654
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:13,240
This move.

1655
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:14,500
I keep fucking it up.

1656
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:16,840
I keep fucking it up!

1657
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:17,880
The two!

1658
01:07:20,020 --> 01:07:20,580
Please!

1659
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:22,680
Why can't you do this kick?

1660
01:07:23,060 --> 01:07:23,900
There you go.

1661
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:24,620
That's why.

1662
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:27,900
And then it's supposed to be like this.

1663
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:28,940
And then...

1664
01:07:28,940 --> 01:07:29,800
Not that.

1665
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:31,820
It's the timing.

1666
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:34,720
I'm not good at timing apparently.

1667
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:37,960
I'm not good at timing apparently.

1668
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:39,520
Exactly.

1669
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:42,080
These people...

1670
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:42,800
Okay, the thing is.

1671
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:43,680
These people...

1672
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:49,000
Have much longer Tekken hours and days of doing combos than me.

1673
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:51,520
And I'm coming in with three days here.

1674
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:51,960
And I'm coming in with three days here.

1675
01:07:52,340 --> 01:07:54,040
Any round I take...

1676
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:56,640
Is like a win for me.

1677
01:07:56,860 --> 01:07:59,220
With the amount of Tekken experience I have.

1678
01:07:59,460 --> 01:07:59,620
With the amount of Tekken experience I have.

1679
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:00,880
Whoa!

1680
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,160
What the fuck?

1681
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:07,460
Okay, what she expect?

1682
01:08:08,540 --> 01:08:10,600
Can you tell this person is a...

1683
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,360
Lazy against King's law?

1684
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:18,920
There you go.

1685
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:20,640
Because I know you like to duck.

1686
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:21,400
So...

1687
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:26,020
Oh god.

1688
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:29,240
Wi-Fi warriors.

1689
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:30,920
Is she on Wi-Fi or am I on Wi-Fi?

1690
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:32,360
Is it my PC?

1691
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:35,200
We'll find... We'll figure it out here.

1692
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:36,400
Yay!

1693
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:39,260
What the fuck?

1694
01:08:39,260 --> 01:08:41,260
Sometimes I don't do the jump...

1695
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:41,760
The...

1696
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:43,820
The low punch.

1697
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:44,940
No, not low punch.

1698
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:45,440
The low kick.

1699
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:47,660
Oh, it's because my fingers...

1700
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:48,500
Were on the wrong area.

1701
01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:52,700
Please.

1702
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:53,680
Please.

1703
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:55,180
Thank you.

1704
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:56,560
That's all I care.

1705
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:57,680
Please.

1706
01:08:58,340 --> 01:08:59,280
Please stop.

1707
01:08:59,280 --> 01:08:59,460
Stop.

1708
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:05,720
Doki.

1709
01:09:06,020 --> 01:09:06,580
Same.

1710
01:09:14,380 --> 01:09:15,220
Doki, please.

1711
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:15,840
I know.

1712
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:16,880
I...

1713
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:20,820
I like tell that to myself every day.

1714
01:09:25,540 --> 01:09:29,140
I like tell that to myself every day.

1715
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:29,260
I like tell that to myself every day.

1716
01:09:29,860 --> 01:09:30,380
Please!

1717
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:32,080
Oh my god!

1718
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:39,920
I got a perfect the one time my combos actually work.

1719
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:43,360
The one time my fingers actually work for me.

1720
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:44,120
The one time my fingers actually work for me.

1721
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:45,320
Okay, do you think she's gonna duck?

1722
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:46,840
Okay, she's just gonna beat me up.

1723
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:51,360
Doki, please.

1724
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:52,260
Doki, please.

1725
01:09:54,220 --> 01:09:54,740
Doki, please.

1726
01:09:54,740 --> 01:09:54,980
Okay.

1727
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:56,960
Guys.

1728
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:57,300
Guys.

1729
01:09:57,380 --> 01:09:57,900
Look.

1730
01:09:58,180 --> 01:09:59,320
We know my place.

1731
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:01,560
We know my place.

1732
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:03,540
We know my place.

1733
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:05,460
We know my place.

1734
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:06,380
Guys.

1735
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:08,860
You think I can improve like...

1736
01:10:08,860 --> 01:10:12,420
Improve 10 speeds in the next 3 days?

1737
01:10:12,580 --> 01:10:13,560
We'll find out.

1738
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:15,360
Okay, let's play against...

1739
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:15,860
I don't care.

1740
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:16,860
People are like...

1741
01:10:16,860 --> 01:10:20,120
People keep telling me to discriminate against the WiFi players.

1742
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:22,460
And reject all WiFi players.

1743
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:23,800
But I was like, I really don't care.

1744
01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:31,220
I don't care.

1745
01:10:31,740 --> 01:10:34,840
I don't care.

1746
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:35,940
Wait, do we join?

1747
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:38,300
Wait, which stage are we?

1748
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:40,420
Oh, shit.

1749
01:10:41,660 --> 01:10:42,180
Alright.

1750
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:43,420
Don't worry.

1751
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:45,580
Nobody said anything!

1752
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:47,580
How was I supposed to know where...

1753
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:48,440
Oh, shit.

1754
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:49,140
I'm not focused.

1755
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:50,160
I was looking at my Discord.

1756
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:55,580
Alright.

1757
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:55,820
Alright.

1758
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:56,920
I'm not focused.

1759
01:10:57,900 --> 01:10:58,380
I was looking at my Discord.

1760
01:10:58,380 --> 01:10:58,680
Oh, my God.

1761
01:10:58,720 --> 01:10:59,500
He actually ducks.

1762
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:00,420
Who would have thought?

1763
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:02,480
Coach, I got a question for you.

1764
01:11:03,820 --> 01:11:04,840
Yeah, what's up, bro?

1765
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:06,000
You in a match right now?

1766
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:07,560
Yeah.

1767
01:11:08,420 --> 01:11:09,600
Let me know when you're out.

1768
01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:12,820
I want your insight on something real quick.

1769
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:15,280
Please.

1770
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:16,500
I'm a believer.

1771
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:17,840
I think...

1772
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:21,940
You came in thinking that I'm gonna go far.

1773
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:25,140
You came in thinking that I'm gonna go far.

1774
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:29,220
It's nice that somebody believes in me, you know?

1775
01:11:29,380 --> 01:11:29,700
It's nice that somebody believes in me, you know?

1776
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:31,300
Wait, you actually blocked Lowe's?

1777
01:11:31,940 --> 01:11:33,080
Bro, what the fuck?

1778
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:34,040
What's wrong with you?

1779
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:34,920
You think you can block this?

1780
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:36,260
No.

1781
01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:37,740
This is literally my one move.

1782
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:43,420
If all else fails...

1783
01:11:45,020 --> 01:11:47,520
If all else fails, I have that one move.

1784
01:11:47,660 --> 01:11:47,700
If all else fails, I have that one move.

1785
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:49,680
Now imagine losing a fucking Ranna off of me.

1786
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:50,540
Now imagine losing a fucking Ranna off of me.

1787
01:11:53,020 --> 01:11:53,800
What are you gonna do?

1788
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:54,660
Do I do this?

1789
01:11:59,440 --> 01:11:59,880
Hey.

1790
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:00,880
Do I do this again?

1791
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:03,800
Hey.

1792
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:05,780
Do I do this again?

1793
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:07,060
Alright, no.

1794
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:07,860
He fucking learned.

1795
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:08,180
Okay.

1796
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:10,060
But what if I do it again?

1797
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:12,020
He does not learn.

1798
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:13,380
I told you.

1799
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:15,100
That's like the only thing I know how to do.

1800
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:20,280
Oh god.

1801
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:21,640
Okay.

1802
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:22,880
You think he's gonna learn again?

1803
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:24,580
Nope.

1804
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:33,360
Alright, let's try again.

1805
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:33,780
Alright, let's try again.

1806
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:33,800
Alright, let's try again.

1807
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:34,280
You think he learned?

1808
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:36,240
Oh, he did.

1809
01:12:36,380 --> 01:12:36,880
He learned.

1810
01:12:36,980 --> 01:12:38,320
Cause he's trying to get closer now.

1811
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:40,300
He's trying...

1812
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:43,620
He's not giving me space anymore.

1813
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:44,720
He's not giving me space anymore.

1814
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:45,460
Bro.

1815
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:49,360
There's no way she would do it again, right?

1816
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:51,560
But there was a way.

1817
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:52,660
You think he learned?

1818
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:54,520
No.

1819
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:56,720
You think he learned?

1820
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:58,580
No.

1821
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:00,180
No.

1822
01:13:02,380 --> 01:13:04,160
You think he learned, guys?

1823
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:06,200
No.

1824
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:18,640
He doesn't learn.

1825
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:20,400
I told you.

1826
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:21,920
I told you.

1827
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:23,580
That's like literally the only thing I know.

1828
01:13:26,580 --> 01:13:28,320
Well, not the only thing.

1829
01:13:28,420 --> 01:13:30,780
But one of the things that I consistently do.

1830
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:32,780
Is just like...

1831
01:13:36,260 --> 01:13:37,100
You guys...

1832
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:39,820
You think he finally learned?

1833
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:42,220
Guys, I don't think he learned.

1834
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:46,560
That's so sad.

1835
01:13:48,180 --> 01:13:51,200
That's the thing is I can't do that for real on people though.

1836
01:13:52,180 --> 01:13:56,040
Cause everybody else trained for like 20 plus hours.

1837
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:58,160
Not the one and done.

1838
01:13:58,380 --> 01:13:59,380
Yeah, I do that to everybody.

1839
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:02,740
I do that to all the players.

1840
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:07,980
They never do.

1841
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:18,140
Yeah, it's a bit toxic.

1842
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:19,580
I didn't realize that was so toxic.

1843
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:23,980
I was just like... I was just like... Bro, I'm Clearly you can beat the shit out of me.

1844
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,940
I'm not gonna fucking give you another game.

1845
01:14:26,180 --> 01:14:26,620
Like...

1846
01:14:28,580 --> 01:14:30,800
I'm just trying to fucking have fun.

1847
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:34,580
Okay, I did not mean to jump there.

1848
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:37,020
That was an accident.

1849
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:38,740
Guys, I think this guy will learn though.

1850
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:40,780
This guy might learn.

1851
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:43,200
Guys... whoa!

1852
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:45,640
You think this guy will learn though?

1853
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:46,980
We'll figure it out.

1854
01:14:50,060 --> 01:14:50,820
There we go.

1855
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:53,060
Okay, give me space.

1856
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:54,740
Give me space so I can see if you learn.

1857
01:14:55,540 --> 01:14:56,620
Oh, he does!

1858
01:14:57,100 --> 01:14:59,260
See, why can't that other guy do it?

1859
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:02,800
Because he... because you're not yellow.

1860
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:08,120
Has the tourney ended?

1861
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:10,340
No, we're just waiting for the next round to start.

1862
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:12,760
He didn't need to learn.

1863
01:15:12,980 --> 01:15:16,320
Because like he... he actually is a good... good enough...

1864
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,380
Okay, I know some people are like, bro, he's bronze.

1865
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:20,780
He's... that's good enough for me.

1866
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:21,880
That's a good...

1867
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:24,860
Good rank for me... with me as a player.

1868
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:27,180
That's a lot.

1869
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:29,420
Yeah, this guy... see, this guy knows!

1870
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:32,620
Like, why can't the other guy do that?

1871
01:15:35,780 --> 01:15:38,100
I don't know why I kept trying to do it.

1872
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:40,200
I was just like, maybe it'll be different, you know?

1873
01:15:44,650 --> 01:15:46,170
Okay, well this is scary.

1874
01:15:49,470 --> 01:15:50,710
This guy is...

1875
01:15:50,710 --> 01:15:53,730
It was just like...

1876
01:15:53,730 --> 01:15:55,550
That guy's first time playing King.

1877
01:15:55,710 --> 01:15:57,010
Bro, he's yellow rank.

1878
01:15:57,030 --> 01:16:00,990
There's no way that that guy was the first time he played.

1879
01:16:01,570 --> 01:16:03,030
Oh god, he's faster.

1880
01:16:04,370 --> 01:16:05,650
He's so much faster.

1881
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:08,330
No!

1882
01:16:11,390 --> 01:16:12,930
Oh my god, I'm...

1883
01:16:12,930 --> 01:16:13,210
Goodbye.

1884
01:16:16,150 --> 01:16:16,750
Oh...

1885
01:16:16,750 --> 01:16:17,730
Oh, goodbye!

1886
01:16:19,810 --> 01:16:22,030
It was his first King.

1887
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:29,520
As long as you have time to hit up your coach.

1888
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:32,300
It sucks, because like...

1889
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:33,060
Oh my gosh.

1890
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:41,340
Okay, so like, Hey, Bronpro and I were talking, like, I think like, the day before yesterday, and then we were...

1891
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:43,700
Because like, I was like, what the fuck?

1892
01:16:43,980 --> 01:16:45,940
Because like, it was supposed to be Connor, right?

1893
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:52,560
Connor was supposed to be in my seed, and then Connor got replaced by another player that's played Tekken before.

1894
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:54,620
I was like, wait, what the fuck?

1895
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:55,040
Like...

1896
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:56,240
HAHAHAHAHA.

1897
01:16:58,870 --> 01:17:00,850
Like, she plays a lot of Tekken.

1898
01:17:00,990 --> 01:17:02,770
And I was like, wait a minute.

1899
01:17:02,990 --> 01:17:05,190
Cjop told me this is for newbies only.

1900
01:17:05,590 --> 01:17:06,330
What the...

1901
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:08,270
What am I doing here?

1902
01:17:10,650 --> 01:17:12,010
I was just like...

1903
01:17:13,070 --> 01:17:15,270
What am I doing here?

1904
01:17:19,550 --> 01:17:20,430
I'm just...

1905
01:17:20,430 --> 01:17:21,610
I'm just like...

1906
01:17:21,610 --> 01:17:24,450
Oh my god, I'm gonna get absolutely destroyed.

1907
01:17:28,510 --> 01:17:29,550
Oh hey, that...

1908
01:17:29,550 --> 01:17:31,090
This king knows what he's doing.

1909
01:17:31,810 --> 01:17:32,790
Bro, he like...

1910
01:17:32,790 --> 01:17:34,030
He's like, stars.

1911
01:17:34,530 --> 01:17:36,270
Because he knows I want to do that thing.

1912
01:17:36,490 --> 01:17:38,670
That only I can do.

1913
01:17:40,830 --> 01:17:41,270
Please.

1914
01:17:43,350 --> 01:17:44,730
Yeah, I'm like...

1915
01:17:45,990 --> 01:17:47,110
The only other...

1916
01:17:47,110 --> 01:17:53,790
Yeah, but like, Gumi, when she gets into a game, she plays a lot of hours of that game.

1917
01:17:53,950 --> 01:17:55,750
And then I, unfortunately...

1918
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:57,570
Okay, I should actually play this game though.

1919
01:17:57,570 --> 01:17:58,010
Okay.

1920
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:02,530
Sorry, I was having a conversation, fellow king player.

1921
01:18:03,030 --> 01:18:04,150
I have to stream.

1922
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:04,910
Sorry.

1923
01:18:05,770 --> 01:18:06,890
I have to stream.

1924
01:18:08,130 --> 01:18:09,230
I think it was alright.

1925
01:18:09,510 --> 01:18:11,010
Gumi's been fucking grinding.

1926
01:18:11,010 --> 01:18:14,350
We just talked about you guys behind your backs and that's about it.

1927
01:18:15,610 --> 01:18:17,230
He's actually been grinding.

1928
01:18:17,370 --> 01:18:19,530
I had other obligations.

1929
01:18:22,210 --> 01:18:25,090
You had a question or something before I got pulled into that?

1930
01:18:25,090 --> 01:18:25,430
Oh, yeah.

1931
01:18:25,830 --> 01:18:26,670
Let's say...

1932
01:18:26,670 --> 01:18:27,010
Hold on.

1933
01:18:27,010 --> 01:18:28,450
Let's say I want to get...

1934
01:18:29,050 --> 01:18:31,010
Actually, I'm going to run so I can do it.

1935
01:18:31,370 --> 01:18:32,710
Oh my god.

1936
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:33,230
Does this...

1937
01:18:35,290 --> 01:18:36,070
Oh my...

1938
01:18:36,070 --> 01:18:39,790
Sometimes my fucking down doesn't register and that makes me sad.

1939
01:18:42,110 --> 01:18:43,030
Oh, wait.

1940
01:18:43,090 --> 01:18:43,790
You should block that.

1941
01:18:43,870 --> 01:18:44,470
You're a king player.

1942
01:18:45,970 --> 01:18:46,870
You block this?

1943
01:18:47,070 --> 01:18:47,890
Oh, he does.

1944
01:18:52,990 --> 01:18:53,950
Let's say...

1945
01:18:53,950 --> 01:18:55,790
I want to go full gen Shen.

1946
01:18:55,790 --> 01:18:56,730
That's so many of the...

1947
01:18:56,730 --> 01:18:58,670
This is the only week I was free.

1948
01:18:58,750 --> 01:19:00,030
I was fully free.

1949
01:19:01,330 --> 01:19:03,230
Everyone tried it so much.

1950
01:19:03,250 --> 01:19:03,330
Oh, Jesus.

1951
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:04,370
Alright, never mind.

1952
01:19:04,550 --> 01:19:04,890
Alright, never mind.

1953
01:19:05,430 --> 01:19:06,430
Alright, never mind.

1954
01:19:07,770 --> 01:19:08,650
Holy shit.

1955
01:19:08,730 --> 01:19:09,930
Oh, it's because I'm doing monitor capture.

1956
01:19:11,190 --> 01:19:12,410
That's probably what it is.

1957
01:19:14,030 --> 01:19:14,470
Maybe.

1958
01:19:14,590 --> 01:19:15,630
Do you want to see?

1959
01:19:15,770 --> 01:19:16,190
Do you want to try?

1960
01:19:16,370 --> 01:19:17,250
Hold on.

1961
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:21,050
My only hours to grind Tekken was like...

1962
01:19:21,050 --> 01:19:24,630
It starts at like around 8 to 10.

1963
01:19:24,650 --> 01:19:26,610
Like around 8 to 10 p.m.

1964
01:19:26,610 --> 01:19:28,550
is when I start grinding Tekken.

1965
01:19:28,770 --> 01:19:29,990
The last three days.

1966
01:19:30,590 --> 01:19:31,790
The first day.

1967
01:19:31,890 --> 01:19:33,690
I grinded Tekken.

1968
01:19:33,950 --> 01:19:38,710
The first day I had a lot of time because it was like right after announcing WrestleTuber.

1969
01:19:38,850 --> 01:19:40,990
So I went straight into it.

1970
01:19:41,070 --> 01:19:42,330
And then I...

1971
01:19:42,330 --> 01:19:46,270
And then I started and then I grinded I think like the day after.

1972
01:19:46,270 --> 01:19:46,890
And then you dash into the down forward.

1973
01:19:47,250 --> 01:19:50,670
My day starts for grinding because I have to do my other obligations first.

1974
01:19:50,710 --> 01:19:52,430
My other work hours stuff first.

1975
01:19:52,670 --> 01:19:55,830
And then I start at like 8 or 10 p.m.

1976
01:19:55,830 --> 01:19:56,610
That's when I start.

1977
01:19:57,070 --> 01:19:59,570
Then everybody else starts way earlier.

1978
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:01,270
72?

1979
01:20:02,470 --> 01:20:03,270
You can...

1980
01:20:03,270 --> 01:20:06,430
Okay, see how much it is if you just back three into the Jaguar Bomb.

1981
01:20:06,630 --> 01:20:09,750
But like for now, now I have a lot of time.

1982
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:11,150
Now I have a lot of time.

1983
01:20:11,410 --> 01:20:14,070
But like everybody is now like 20 hours.

1984
01:20:14,570 --> 01:20:17,230
I heard like SK has like nine hours.

1985
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:19,810
I heard like SK has like 90 hours plus when I started.

1986
01:20:20,030 --> 01:20:21,810
I don't care about optimizing it.

1987
01:20:21,870 --> 01:20:22,010
Yeah.

1988
01:20:22,130 --> 01:20:22,830
Let's just pause.

1989
01:20:25,510 --> 01:20:26,710
No, I meant like...

1990
01:20:27,070 --> 01:20:28,370
No, I didn't mean like 8 to 10.

1991
01:20:28,470 --> 01:20:31,390
I mean I start at either 8 o'clock or 10 p.m.

1992
01:20:31,810 --> 01:20:34,770
But then I would play until 4 in the morning.

1993
01:20:34,890 --> 01:20:35,330
But then I would play until 4 in the morning.

1994
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:36,950
I would play until 4 in the morning.

1995
01:20:37,350 --> 01:20:38,370
I would start at like 8, 7.

1996
01:20:38,990 --> 01:20:40,770
Or 7 to 10 p.m.

1997
01:20:40,770 --> 01:20:42,810
And then I'd grind until 4 a.m.

1998
01:20:42,830 --> 01:20:47,630
But then like by the time I started grinding, SK had fucking 90 hours.

1999
01:20:47,730 --> 01:20:49,230
And like I think she...

2000
01:20:49,230 --> 01:20:52,730
I think she has like like a 130 plus hours now.

2001
01:20:52,870 --> 01:20:54,110
And now here I am.

2002
01:20:54,310 --> 01:20:54,870
And now here I am.

2003
01:20:54,870 --> 01:20:56,070
I never use this move.

2004
01:20:56,650 --> 01:20:59,170
And I was looking at the intel report.

2005
01:20:59,170 --> 01:21:00,390
You could also do 1 plus 2 is 3 after watching them.

2006
01:21:00,390 --> 01:21:05,670
I was looking at the intel report and all the other newbies were like close to Red rank already.

2007
01:21:05,670 --> 01:21:06,830
were like close to Red rank already.

2008
01:21:06,990 --> 01:21:09,150
I was like what the fuck.

2009
01:21:10,310 --> 01:21:13,110
And some newbies have had tanking experience before.

2010
01:21:13,110 --> 01:21:13,390
And some newbies have had tanking experience before.

2011
01:21:13,390 --> 01:21:14,510
And some newbies have had tanking experience before.

2012
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:17,710
I'm like, what am I doing here?

2013
01:21:18,210 --> 01:21:20,230
What am I doing here?

2014
01:21:20,290 --> 01:21:22,890
I thought newbies meant as a newbie newbie.

2015
01:21:23,350 --> 01:21:25,950
Oh, you can try that as well.

2016
01:21:27,370 --> 01:21:30,670
I went in thinking newbie meant actually newbie.

2017
01:21:32,950 --> 01:21:34,550
So what's this on the damage?

2018
01:21:34,930 --> 01:21:40,930
But newbies were not... I didn't realize newbies have not meant newbie anymore.

2019
01:21:42,550 --> 01:21:44,470
I can't believe it.

2020
01:21:44,470 --> 01:21:44,810
Got it.

2021
01:21:47,370 --> 01:21:48,170
I'm trying.

2022
01:21:48,690 --> 01:21:51,690
You think she knows how to... no, she doesn't give me space for this.

2023
01:21:52,530 --> 01:21:54,650
I got sent to the wuzz.

2024
01:21:54,950 --> 01:21:55,750
I did.

2025
01:21:56,390 --> 01:21:58,210
Maybe I can fit in one match.

2026
01:21:58,630 --> 01:21:59,430
I did.

2027
01:21:59,830 --> 01:22:01,850
I got sent to the fucking gulags.

2028
01:22:03,470 --> 01:22:05,110
Oh my god, I don't get the one-on-one.

2029
01:22:05,110 --> 01:22:06,870
Oh wait, that was not what I wanted to do.

2030
01:22:07,190 --> 01:22:09,690
In two days, I'll just scream way earlier.

2031
01:22:10,590 --> 01:22:13,190
Yeah, like the average was much higher.

2032
01:22:13,410 --> 01:22:14,450
But I'm having fun.

2033
01:22:14,470 --> 01:22:14,770
I'm having fun though.

2034
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:16,450
Learning Tekken for...

2035
01:22:16,950 --> 01:22:19,030
Wait, why am I playing as a red?

2036
01:22:19,070 --> 01:22:21,470
Every single round went game five by the way.

2037
01:22:21,550 --> 01:22:23,490
So everything is like dead even right now.

2038
01:22:23,490 --> 01:22:24,070
Alright, it's fine.

2039
01:22:24,270 --> 01:22:25,010
She's red.

2040
01:22:27,050 --> 01:22:28,350
I'm having fun though.

2041
01:22:28,590 --> 01:22:32,330
But it's like... I'm just like what the fuck am I doing here?

2042
01:22:33,830 --> 01:22:38,190
You know, if you guys do end up burying me this time around, I'm totally cool with that.

2043
01:22:38,310 --> 01:22:41,090
Because I did a lot of work last time.

2044
01:22:41,750 --> 01:22:43,450
You only played a couple sets.

2045
01:22:43,450 --> 01:22:44,290
And that's how I'm feeling.

2046
01:22:44,430 --> 01:22:45,410
But I'm still trying, right?

2047
01:22:45,410 --> 01:22:46,390
It's a quick match.

2048
01:22:46,450 --> 01:22:47,330
I'm trying.

2049
01:22:47,370 --> 01:22:47,910
That man went five.

2050
01:22:47,970 --> 01:22:48,230
That man went five.

2051
01:22:48,230 --> 01:22:48,670
I'm 0, bro.

2052
01:22:48,830 --> 01:22:49,590
I mean...

2053
01:22:50,250 --> 01:22:51,130
You lose.

2054
01:22:51,190 --> 01:22:52,690
I only lost to one person.

2055
01:22:52,730 --> 01:22:53,350
What did you do?

2056
01:22:53,490 --> 01:22:55,570
You know, you beat one guy, right?

2057
01:22:55,710 --> 01:22:57,410
The tiebreaker, dude.

2058
01:22:57,710 --> 01:22:58,770
It's all mental.

2059
01:22:58,910 --> 01:23:01,330
I mean, you won one set though, you know?

2060
01:23:01,330 --> 01:23:01,770
So...

2061
01:23:01,770 --> 01:23:03,970
Damn, he ain't fucking called out.

2062
01:23:04,970 --> 01:23:05,790
I don't know.

2063
01:23:08,930 --> 01:23:10,830
When is our next round starting?

2064
01:23:11,510 --> 01:23:12,270
It started.

2065
01:23:12,490 --> 01:23:13,430
So you can end it.

2066
01:23:13,430 --> 01:23:14,030
I'm gonna try to enter the...

2067
01:23:14,030 --> 01:23:14,830
Oh, nice.

2068
01:23:15,350 --> 01:23:16,510
Yeah, if you go up to...

2069
01:23:16,510 --> 01:23:17,590
What is it?

2070
01:23:17,590 --> 01:23:18,190
Stage one.

2071
01:23:19,770 --> 01:23:21,430
All right, stage one.

2072
01:23:21,850 --> 01:23:21,870
And then you gotta copy paste.

2073
01:23:22,370 --> 01:23:22,890
Let's see.

2074
01:23:23,010 --> 01:23:24,950
I learned how to do it for real this time.

2075
01:23:27,330 --> 01:23:28,130
All right.

2076
01:23:28,310 --> 01:23:29,810
Time to get my ass kicked.

2077
01:23:29,970 --> 01:23:30,410
Let's go.

2078
01:23:31,910 --> 01:23:34,810
10 hour Doki versus 110 hour SK.

2079
01:23:35,070 --> 01:23:35,590
Let's get it.

2080
01:23:35,590 --> 01:23:35,610
Oh, okay.

2081
01:23:35,610 --> 01:23:37,570
I was telling them about the SK thing.

2082
01:23:37,770 --> 01:23:38,050
Yeah.

2083
01:23:38,450 --> 01:23:40,710
10 hour session.

2084
01:23:41,990 --> 01:23:42,510
I'm gonna do it.

2085
01:23:42,770 --> 01:23:43,290
I'm gonna do it.

2086
01:23:43,290 --> 01:23:43,310
I'm gonna do it.

2087
01:23:43,310 --> 01:23:43,410
I'm gonna do it.

2088
01:23:44,810 --> 01:23:47,210
Yeah, I'm not catching up to SK.

2089
01:23:47,790 --> 01:23:50,870
There's not enough hours in the day for me to catch up.

2090
01:23:52,430 --> 01:23:53,050
Wait, no.

2091
01:23:53,090 --> 01:23:54,570
You can radio up, can't you?

2092
01:23:55,250 --> 01:23:55,890
Okay, yeah.

2093
01:23:55,930 --> 01:23:57,210
They said you guys are good to go.

2094
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:05,860
Maybe I can ask SK to give me like one free hit.

2095
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:09,300
DM her.

2096
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:10,060
DM her right now.

2097
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:14,560
Can I have one free hit?

2098
01:24:15,340 --> 01:24:16,860
Yeah, just so Doki knows.

2099
01:24:16,980 --> 01:24:18,560
Okay, you can radio up right now.

2100
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:20,040
I only have 10 hours.

2101
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:30,440
Slime.

2102
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:33,220
You gotta do the little toggle state thingy.

2103
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:36,900
And the FDC guy has to do it too.

2104
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:37,960
There you go.

2105
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:38,320
Yay.

2106
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,180
Time to 3-0 SK.

2107
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:44,420
SK, please.

2108
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:44,720
Let's get it.

2109
01:24:44,820 --> 01:24:46,120
Just let me have one hit.

2110
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:46,960
That's all I got.

2111
01:24:46,980 --> 01:24:47,580
I want it.

2112
01:24:48,020 --> 01:24:49,840
No, we're getting several hits.

2113
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:50,800
Okay.

2114
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:52,320
True, true, true.

2115
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:53,240
True.

2116
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:55,720
True.

2117
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:57,640
I'm gonna, like, dream of that too.

2118
01:24:58,040 --> 01:24:59,440
We will land many moves.

2119
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:03,890
A combo even.

2120
01:25:04,130 --> 01:25:04,430
Yeah.

2121
01:25:04,490 --> 01:25:05,050
Oh my god.

2122
01:25:05,070 --> 01:25:07,630
A com- okay, maybe you're asking a bit too much.

2123
01:25:07,850 --> 01:25:08,670
A combo actually.

2124
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:09,750
Whoa!

2125
01:25:09,850 --> 01:25:10,570
A combo.

2126
01:25:11,430 --> 01:25:12,470
We hit a 1-1.

2127
01:25:12,550 --> 01:25:14,370
I don't think I've seen that before.

2128
01:25:14,650 --> 01:25:15,270
That's what I'm saying.

2129
01:25:15,370 --> 01:25:15,490
That's what I'm saying.

2130
01:25:16,410 --> 01:25:16,890
Okay.

2131
01:25:18,850 --> 01:25:19,330
Alright.

2132
01:25:21,170 --> 01:25:21,810
That's right.

2133
01:25:21,870 --> 01:25:26,490
I gotta get into the mental of winning of one hit in the combo.

2134
01:25:30,180 --> 01:25:33,620
And you can just also just use it as a learning experience too.

2135
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:35,820
That's true.

2136
01:25:35,900 --> 01:25:36,280
That's true.

2137
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:37,420
It's only round robin one.

2138
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:43,720
I'm gonna give them like a false sense of security so when the finals hit...

2139
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:45,980
Are you still in the game Doki?

2140
01:25:45,980 --> 01:25:46,500
Yeah.

2141
01:25:46,660 --> 01:25:48,080
I'm like loading up.

2142
01:25:48,420 --> 01:25:49,360
We're in now.

2143
01:25:49,620 --> 01:25:51,780
I think we all got dropped from the special.

2144
01:25:52,060 --> 01:25:52,660
Wait.

2145
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:53,200
What?

2146
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:53,840
Oh thank god.

2147
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:54,180
Okay.

2148
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:57,780
Well I pulled up SK stream.

2149
01:25:57,960 --> 01:25:59,080
I'm still on SK stream.

2150
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:00,420
Guys I got a hit!

2151
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:01,920
Guys!

2152
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:04,580
You wouldn't believe it.

2153
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:05,900
I got three hits!

2154
01:26:06,580 --> 01:26:07,840
Oh my god!

2155
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:09,540
I got three hits!

2156
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:10,440
What?

2157
01:26:11,140 --> 01:26:11,740
Wait.

2158
01:26:11,820 --> 01:26:12,420
Hold on.

2159
01:26:13,660 --> 01:26:15,060
Oh my god.

2160
01:26:15,220 --> 01:26:15,960
Why did you do that?

2161
01:26:15,980 --> 01:26:17,800
Why did you guys drop when I got hit?

2162
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:19,760
I couldn't KO!

2163
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:21,280
What?

2164
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:25,240
Alright.

2165
01:26:25,460 --> 01:26:26,400
Now it's all downhill.

2166
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:27,840
No!

2167
01:26:31,660 --> 01:26:33,760
Guys I can't believe it!

2168
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:39,100
We can't believe the one time you guys got locked out.

2169
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:40,060
Bro.

2170
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:42,200
Bro.

2171
01:26:42,380 --> 01:26:42,980
Hell.

2172
01:26:43,700 --> 01:26:44,040
Hell.

2173
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:46,380
Why am I so unlucky?

2174
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:51,680
Why am I so unlucky?

2175
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:52,480
Let's get it!

2176
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:55,520
That's shit!

2177
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:57,280
Oh no.

2178
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:57,860
Okay.

2179
01:26:58,020 --> 01:26:58,660
That's alright.

2180
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:01,680
I think SK was maybe toying with me for real.

2181
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:04,240
Okay.

2182
01:27:04,300 --> 01:27:04,520
Goodbye.

2183
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:06,160
You do more grabs than I do.

2184
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:08,200
You're popping shit I haven't seen.

2185
01:27:08,820 --> 01:27:09,640
Oh my god.

2186
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:11,240
I don't even know what I'm doing.

2187
01:27:11,860 --> 01:27:13,940
That JK I know what I'm doing.

2188
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:17,680
That's right.

2189
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:18,780
It's all about the fun.

2190
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,020
I got my one hit.

2191
01:27:22,540 --> 01:27:23,560
Just keep grabbing.

2192
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:25,400
I think you win if you just grab like a madman.

2193
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:26,160
That's true.

2194
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:27,200
That's true.

2195
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:28,580
Oh my god.

2196
01:27:28,580 --> 01:27:28,960
You're right.

2197
01:27:29,260 --> 01:27:29,700
Okay.

2198
01:27:29,780 --> 01:27:30,160
They learned.

2199
01:27:30,260 --> 01:27:30,560
Yeah.

2200
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:30,940
They learned.

2201
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:31,940
They learned.

2202
01:27:33,660 --> 01:27:34,300
They learned.

2203
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:35,560
They learned the down on the controller.

2204
01:27:35,940 --> 01:27:36,380
Wait.

2205
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:38,060
What the fuck?

2206
01:27:41,660 --> 01:27:43,740
I think now is when we use the RDC.

2207
01:27:43,740 --> 01:27:44,740
RDC technique.

2208
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:46,700
You can do it.

2209
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:47,640
I bet it'll work.

2210
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:48,380
True.

2211
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:48,960
True.

2212
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:52,880
Oh no.

2213
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,420
Now I'm in a long ass combo.

2214
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:00,340
Oh no.

2215
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:02,400
How is she so fast?

2216
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:07,320
Nice.

2217
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:08,140
Okay.

2218
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:10,240
No.

2219
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:11,500
I'm not fast enough.

2220
01:28:13,980 --> 01:28:16,020
I think she'll do a one plus two after.

2221
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,500
Why is she so fast?

2222
01:28:21,820 --> 01:28:22,300
Yeah.

2223
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:22,920
Rain is cheap.

2224
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:26,460
Is this why everybody plays her?

2225
01:28:27,780 --> 01:28:28,260
Oh.

2226
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:29,560
It's all right.

2227
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:30,740
I got my two rounds.

2228
01:28:30,820 --> 01:28:31,560
Now I'm happy.

2229
01:28:32,580 --> 01:28:33,440
That was impressive.

2230
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:38,300
You almost had... Lock in.

2231
01:28:38,380 --> 01:28:39,940
Lock in and this is actually yours.

2232
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:40,680
Okay.

2233
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:42,440
I believe so hard.

2234
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:44,320
Okay.

2235
01:28:44,580 --> 01:28:45,120
All right.

2236
01:28:45,420 --> 01:28:47,320
At least somebody believes in me.

2237
01:28:48,140 --> 01:28:48,600
Hey.

2238
01:28:48,700 --> 01:28:49,140
I believe.

2239
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:52,540
But do you believe in me in your heart though?

2240
01:28:53,180 --> 01:28:53,640
Yes.

2241
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:54,760
Or is it just words?

2242
01:28:55,340 --> 01:28:55,800
Yes.

2243
01:28:55,820 --> 01:28:56,060
No.

2244
01:28:56,060 --> 01:28:56,500
I believe.

2245
01:28:57,380 --> 01:28:58,340
What you just did.

2246
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:02,020
I think if you get your offense off, you're good.

2247
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,060
Just run your stuff.

2248
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:06,240
Oh my God.

2249
01:29:07,020 --> 01:29:07,480
Please.

2250
01:29:07,940 --> 01:29:08,660
Please escape.

2251
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:09,060
Please.

2252
01:29:10,020 --> 01:29:11,920
I thought you were going gentle on me.

2253
01:29:12,060 --> 01:29:12,500
Escape.

2254
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:13,960
Please let me have a move.

2255
01:29:19,140 --> 01:29:20,020
Oh, come on.

2256
01:29:21,820 --> 01:29:23,460
Nice mix with that shit.

2257
01:29:24,980 --> 01:29:25,780
Oh God.

2258
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:30,340
Hey, remember your fight or flight?

2259
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:31,000
Yeah.

2260
01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:34,000
We can try that.

2261
01:29:37,160 --> 01:29:39,040
Oh, escape like knows I want to escape.

2262
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:47,100
I can't believe she knows King players like to grab.

2263
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:49,200
Yeah.

2264
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:49,680
Who did?

2265
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:49,880
Who?

2266
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:51,120
Honestly, who taught her this?

2267
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:51,760
I know.

2268
01:29:51,860 --> 01:29:52,960
It's actually crazy.

2269
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:54,920
100 hours.

2270
01:29:56,060 --> 01:29:58,480
It must be like all the King players she fought.

2271
01:29:59,220 --> 01:30:00,040
Forbidden knowledge.

2272
01:30:00,460 --> 01:30:00,900
Okay.

2273
01:30:04,100 --> 01:30:05,180
I thought I was going to land.

2274
01:30:05,580 --> 01:30:06,160
Me too.

2275
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:07,400
Oh.

2276
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:08,280
Rain is shooting.

2277
01:30:08,580 --> 01:30:09,020
Oh, I'm going to die.

2278
01:30:09,020 --> 01:30:10,400
There's a rain.

2279
01:30:10,620 --> 01:30:12,420
Rain is cheap.

2280
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:12,720
That's.

2281
01:30:12,780 --> 01:30:13,800
Oh my God.

2282
01:30:13,860 --> 01:30:15,000
She ducked.

2283
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:16,980
Stop ducking.

2284
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:19,500
It's being taller.

2285
01:30:24,740 --> 01:30:25,420
Goodbye.

2286
01:30:25,580 --> 01:30:27,980
I had a good one set.

2287
01:30:33,220 --> 01:30:34,700
Oh, that's good luck.

2288
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:35,440
Oh.

2289
01:30:36,860 --> 01:30:37,540
Oh.

2290
01:30:39,460 --> 01:30:40,480
Nice try.

2291
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:41,000
Nice try.

2292
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:41,560
It's alright.

2293
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:43,100
I had my moment in the beginning.

2294
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:48,380
I grabbed two rounds off a 110 hour SK.

2295
01:30:48,700 --> 01:30:48,720
Two rounds?

2296
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:50,800
Not bad.

2297
01:30:50,980 --> 01:30:51,280
Not bad.

2298
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:55,560
I think once we just teach you mids, like to counteract the duck, it's easy.

2299
01:30:55,860 --> 01:30:58,700
I think once you play 100 more hours...

2300
01:30:58,700 --> 01:31:00,480
Yeah, I just need 100 more hours.

2301
01:31:00,780 --> 01:31:01,300
I can see that.

2302
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:04,280
100 more hours of game before Friday.

2303
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:05,920
We can make that work.

2304
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:07,720
It's so easy.

2305
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:10,020
Who needs sleep?

2306
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:11,280
It's all about the Tekken.

2307
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:14,660
Hold on, I gotta join back in that lobby.

2308
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:17,120
What do I fucking... No, get me out of here.

2309
01:31:27,430 --> 01:31:29,170
Guys, I can't believe...

2310
01:31:29,170 --> 01:31:32,650
I can't believe it!

2311
01:31:32,770 --> 01:31:35,090
They got spectated on the rounds!

2312
01:31:35,130 --> 01:31:36,990
I actually do well!

2313
01:31:41,790 --> 01:31:43,590
What is my luck?

2314
01:31:44,950 --> 01:31:47,610
I was like, oh thank god they DC'd.

2315
01:31:47,650 --> 01:31:49,590
They don't have to watch this.

2316
01:31:50,050 --> 01:31:51,350
You played Power Rangers?

2317
01:31:51,890 --> 01:31:52,270
Alright.

2318
01:31:52,490 --> 01:31:53,590
Oh, I thought it was Raiditz.

2319
01:31:54,450 --> 01:31:55,150
Is it Catlin?

2320
01:31:55,390 --> 01:31:57,070
Thank fucking god!

2321
01:31:57,410 --> 01:31:58,750
Slime has Raiditz, yeah.

2322
01:31:58,950 --> 01:32:00,210
Oh, it's... okay, got you.

2323
01:32:00,850 --> 01:32:01,510
Wait, really?

2324
01:32:01,670 --> 01:32:02,810
I thought... oh wait!

2325
01:32:02,950 --> 01:32:04,930
I thought it was... dude, we ran into Raiditz yesterday.

2326
01:32:05,050 --> 01:32:05,350
Oh yeah!

2327
01:32:05,410 --> 01:32:05,770
We have data!

2328
01:32:07,010 --> 01:32:07,890
Oh yeah?

2329
01:32:08,050 --> 01:32:08,950
We can tell you some shit.

2330
01:32:09,030 --> 01:32:09,230
Yeah, Slime.

2331
01:32:09,330 --> 01:32:09,730
Yeah, seriously.

2332
01:32:11,990 --> 01:32:12,990
I'm so down.

2333
01:32:13,110 --> 01:32:13,530
I did it.

2334
01:32:13,530 --> 01:32:15,670
Cause I thought... I thought I was fighting Raiditz.

2335
01:32:15,670 --> 01:32:15,830
I fucking did it.

2336
01:32:15,830 --> 01:32:16,290
I was ready to go.

2337
01:32:16,430 --> 01:32:18,210
Get ready for the next battle!

2338
01:32:18,650 --> 01:32:19,550
You got this shit.

2339
01:32:19,750 --> 01:32:20,010
Alright.

2340
01:32:21,190 --> 01:32:23,630
I do not know Azusena, but we learn on the fly.

2341
01:32:23,830 --> 01:32:24,510
I believe.

2342
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:33,840
Good sidestep.

2343
01:32:35,820 --> 01:32:39,480
Alright, we're just backing up a lot.

2344
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:40,020
This is grabs.

2345
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:42,420
Oh my... we're doing that until they...

2346
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:45,480
They're probably getting active coaching about it though.

2347
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:46,280
Yeah.

2348
01:32:48,140 --> 01:32:50,620
Nice block, Kony!

2349
01:32:51,160 --> 01:32:51,980
Oh!

2350
01:32:52,820 --> 01:32:54,420
Why am I delayed?

2351
01:32:54,920 --> 01:32:55,820
I mean...

2352
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:00,920
Three points!

2353
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:04,500
Yeah, last night with the rank.

2354
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:06,440
Three points.

2355
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:07,180
Distributor.

2356
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:08,540
Ooh!

2357
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,580
We're just cleaning up Azusena nation here.

2358
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:15,200
What the fuck was that?

2359
01:33:15,700 --> 01:33:16,920
Dude, all the way.

2360
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:17,980
Oh my... that was a good bridge.

2361
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:19,680
Oh!

2362
01:33:22,540 --> 01:33:25,560
Oh, I'm like five seconds behind you guys.

2363
01:33:26,340 --> 01:33:27,460
Is that a wall coach?

2364
01:33:29,100 --> 01:33:30,560
Bro, don't do that, bro.

2365
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:32,560
Is that a wall coach?

2366
01:33:34,140 --> 01:33:35,420
I think it might be.

2367
01:33:35,740 --> 01:33:37,200
I think that might be a wall.

2368
01:33:37,220 --> 01:33:37,700
Oh my god, what a combo.

2369
01:33:37,820 --> 01:33:38,900
Oh my god.

2370
01:33:38,900 --> 01:33:39,320
Oh my god!

2371
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:41,460
Oh my god!

2372
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:43,960
Chat, I'll be able to do that in three days.

2373
01:33:43,960 --> 01:33:45,180
Stop breaking ones, bro!

2374
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:46,840
I hope they coach is talking.

2375
01:33:48,460 --> 01:33:49,360
It's dress up.

2376
01:33:52,260 --> 01:33:53,320
Oh, now it's ones.

2377
01:33:53,380 --> 01:33:54,440
Okay, we only break ones.

2378
01:33:54,660 --> 01:33:54,920
Okay.

2379
01:33:55,740 --> 01:33:57,480
Might just be mashing the one-one move.

2380
01:33:57,580 --> 01:33:58,320
That move right there.

2381
01:33:58,560 --> 01:33:58,700
Yeah.

2382
01:33:58,700 --> 01:34:00,420
Yeah, because it's doing the counter hit sound.

2383
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:01,280
So she's just mashing one.

2384
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:05,240
Oh, such a smart decision from a smart player named Coney.

2385
01:34:05,420 --> 01:34:07,040
Oh my god, who is he?

2386
01:34:07,700 --> 01:34:09,700
Knee into any other grab that isn't one.

2387
01:34:09,820 --> 01:34:10,960
And I mean, you take it easy.

2388
01:34:11,140 --> 01:34:11,840
3-0 as well.

2389
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:12,260
Yeah, yeah.

2390
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:13,560
Let's just keep going twos.

2391
01:34:13,780 --> 01:34:14,480
Yeah, just do two.

2392
01:34:14,660 --> 01:34:15,780
She's literally mashing one.

2393
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:16,440
Yeah.

2394
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:20,060
Oh, I'm like, oh, I'm like, oh, I'm like, oh, I'm like, oh, I'm like, oh, I'm like, I'm like, go from the floor.

2395
01:34:20,060 --> 01:34:20,300
Oh, what?

2396
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:22,000
Wait, what quit?

2397
01:34:22,160 --> 01:34:22,520
That's fine.

2398
01:34:22,540 --> 01:34:23,860
I wanted to change my skin anyway.

2399
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:27,600
It's a mental game.

2400
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:32,520
We're gonna change our skin to the baneskin from last night and see if Raiditz knows.

2401
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:34,300
That's him!

2402
01:34:34,540 --> 01:34:35,140
That's him!

2403
01:34:37,460 --> 01:34:45,000
I actually, so Slime, I was holding on to last night, I went to last round with Raiditz and I was like alright, I'll lose, which I'm fine with.

2404
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:46,800
But if I spammed back three...

2405
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:47,660
I think I would have beat him.

2406
01:34:47,780 --> 01:34:54,560
Because like, he's just mashing, so I don't know how good Bear's power crushes are.

2407
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:55,740
It's pretty good.

2408
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:58,940
Don't like spam it obviously, but like, hold it.

2409
01:34:59,040 --> 01:34:59,540
You know what I mean?

2410
01:34:59,660 --> 01:35:00,400
It's acceptable, yeah yeah.

2411
01:35:01,620 --> 01:35:02,200
Alright, we go B.

2412
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:05,120
He does a three hit over and over.

2413
01:35:05,260 --> 01:35:08,140
It's like a kick, then a punch, and then another punch.

2414
01:35:08,340 --> 01:35:09,320
It's like back four, two, one.

2415
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:10,620
Oh, never mind.

2416
01:35:10,700 --> 01:35:11,740
I am playing Raid.

2417
01:35:11,740 --> 01:35:12,500
It's on a different team.

2418
01:35:12,620 --> 01:35:13,120
Oh, never mind.

2419
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:13,920
Alright, well then I'm out.

2420
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:14,500
Oh, okay okay.

2421
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:16,920
It's just confusing.

2422
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:17,460
Alright, never mind.

2423
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:20,380
Avoid everything.

2424
01:35:21,060 --> 01:35:22,100
Crashing this boat.

2425
01:35:22,360 --> 01:35:23,540
He's realizing.

2426
01:35:24,220 --> 01:35:25,420
With no survivors!

2427
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:26,480
Fight!

2428
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:31,160
Oh my, wait, she changed her outfit too!

2429
01:35:31,480 --> 01:35:31,500
Put me down!

2430
01:35:49,330 --> 01:35:50,410
Yeah, every time.

2431
01:35:51,710 --> 01:35:53,190
She doesn't know she's minus.

2432
01:35:53,890 --> 01:35:55,210
Ooh, love that.

2433
01:35:57,570 --> 01:35:58,490
Oh, nice.

2434
01:36:01,270 --> 01:36:02,030
Round two.

2435
01:36:03,070 --> 01:36:03,470
Fight!

2436
01:36:12,340 --> 01:36:13,140
Remember that.

2437
01:36:13,460 --> 01:36:14,180
Yes, I know.

2438
01:36:14,180 --> 01:36:14,480
Overshore.

2439
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:14,920
Yeah.

2440
01:36:16,340 --> 01:36:16,740
Yup.

2441
01:36:17,380 --> 01:36:18,980
This will not work in two days.

2442
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:20,360
True.

2443
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:21,140
One, two, one.

2444
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:22,460
Yeah, but then we go level two.

2445
01:36:22,640 --> 01:36:23,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

2446
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:26,080
But level two is so fake though.

2447
01:36:26,640 --> 01:36:28,000
And then you go to brand destroyer.

2448
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:28,880
Then you go level three!

2449
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:30,480
Then you go brand destroyer!

2450
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:31,740
Then we go back to level one.

2451
01:36:31,740 --> 01:36:32,460
We start doing it again.

2452
01:36:32,460 --> 01:36:33,420
That's true, yeah.

2453
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:36,400
That's true, yeah.

2454
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:36,460
That's true, yeah.

2455
01:36:36,460 --> 01:36:37,440
NL was right, man.

2456
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:39,400
What a dog.

2457
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:41,840
That was all great.

2458
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:43,820
Mm, good low.

2459
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:44,920
She keeps going high there.

2460
01:36:46,340 --> 01:36:46,700
Okay.

2461
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:49,040
I'm just gonna keep popping.

2462
01:36:49,460 --> 01:36:51,480
I mean, like, fuck, just lock it in, you know?

2463
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:52,620
Like, oh my god.

2464
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:53,120
Just give me my points.

2465
01:36:53,260 --> 01:36:54,080
Just give me my points.

2466
01:36:54,180 --> 01:36:54,440
Dude!

2467
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:57,620
If I did the shoulder, I'd win that.

2468
01:36:57,720 --> 01:36:58,000
Fuck.

2469
01:36:59,100 --> 01:37:01,720
When she hits you with a running three, two, just get up and hold back.

2470
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:02,440
We'll probably do another one.

2471
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:03,560
Okay.

2472
01:37:04,740 --> 01:37:05,540
Round four.

2473
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:07,120
Fight.

2474
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:11,920
Shoulder.

2475
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,160
Shoulder is too hard.

2476
01:37:13,460 --> 01:37:14,640
Maybe one day.

2477
01:37:18,280 --> 01:37:18,680
Okay.

2478
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:19,920
Listen, next time.

2479
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:22,360
You know, tomorrow, you're literally gonna be five hours of running.

2480
01:37:22,360 --> 01:37:24,360
I was gonna say, I'm doing shoulder drills tomorrow.

2481
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:24,920
Seriously.

2482
01:37:25,240 --> 01:37:27,360
Like, I just, if I do that, I'm good.

2483
01:37:27,620 --> 01:37:30,740
Like, just imagine what if you lost because you didn't hit that confirm.

2484
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:31,860
And that will motivate you.

2485
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:32,280
I know.

2486
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:32,980
I know.

2487
01:37:33,060 --> 01:37:33,340
I know.

2488
01:37:33,380 --> 01:37:34,220
And that will motivate you.

2489
01:37:34,240 --> 01:37:34,360
You're gonna be like, oh, I'm gonna do this.

2490
01:37:34,360 --> 01:37:34,440
Okay.

2491
01:37:34,440 --> 01:37:35,220
You'll never ever ever.

2492
01:37:36,420 --> 01:37:36,860
Ooh.

2493
01:37:37,020 --> 01:37:37,480
Good shit.

2494
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:38,580
Let's go .

2495
01:37:38,580 --> 01:37:39,320
Fucking solid.

2496
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:41,720
Tony wins.

2497
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:42,640
Yeah.

2498
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:43,380
Fucking easy.

2499
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:44,080
Tony wins.

2500
01:37:44,220 --> 01:37:44,880
Good shit.

2501
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:45,240
Good shit.

2502
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:45,500
Good shit.

2503
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:45,960
Okay.

2504
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:49,920
Get in there, Boo Boo Bear.

2505
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:50,920
Nice.

2506
01:37:50,920 --> 01:37:51,640
Who are you fighting against?

2507
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:54,960
Oh, this guy.

2508
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:56,380
The thing-Wang.

2509
01:37:56,380 --> 01:37:56,660
The thing-Wang.

2510
01:37:56,660 --> 01:37:56,920
Way.

2511
01:38:00,440 --> 01:38:04,480
You just beat a Tekken King, Kishin, Kishin Cousins, and shit.

2512
01:38:05,980 --> 01:38:09,480
I do, I will say, I've played this character very little.

2513
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:10,840
I'll be Kishin your mom.

2514
01:38:11,800 --> 01:38:13,140
That's what I'm saying bro.

2515
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:14,580
Not my mom.

2516
01:38:14,660 --> 01:38:15,980
That's what I DM'd to all these guys.

2517
01:38:18,660 --> 01:38:19,700
Alright, we can go in ready?

2518
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:21,140
Run it.

2519
01:38:21,700 --> 01:38:22,140
Uhh...

2520
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:23,920
Let's go.

2521
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:29,360
Go log brother.

2522
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:47,080
You know...

2523
01:38:47,960 --> 01:38:50,360
Guys, do you guys believe in me?

2524
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:55,240
That I'll learn a lot more Tekken moves in two days?

2525
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:56,820
Do you guys believe?

2526
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:59,980
In two days, I'm gonna improve so much.

2527
01:39:00,160 --> 01:39:01,160
I swear.

2528
01:39:02,380 --> 01:39:04,500
Why does this bear have a rose?

2529
01:39:04,740 --> 01:39:06,000
He's just deli- Wait.

2530
01:39:06,780 --> 01:39:07,380
What?

2531
01:39:07,960 --> 01:39:08,760
I can feel it.

2532
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:09,720
Okay.

2533
01:39:10,580 --> 01:39:11,300
He knows.

2534
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:12,420
He knows the G-Cluster.

2535
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:13,220
He knows.

2536
01:39:13,300 --> 01:39:14,660
He analyzed your playstyle.

2537
01:39:24,640 --> 01:39:25,280
Oh wow.

2538
01:39:29,980 --> 01:39:30,460
Oh?

2539
01:39:32,460 --> 01:39:33,840
Just never let him get up.

2540
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:34,600
Damn it.

2541
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:37,520
After you get hit by the splits, just hold back.

2542
01:39:37,620 --> 01:39:38,440
He's 2+.

2543
01:39:38,440 --> 01:39:39,300
Okay.

2544
01:39:41,540 --> 01:39:42,020
Tio.

2545
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:45,840
What the fuck?

2546
01:39:48,740 --> 01:39:50,580
I don't know what he does.

2547
01:39:54,040 --> 01:39:55,540
Definitely matchup gap.

2548
01:39:56,820 --> 01:39:57,700
Thanks, Hard.

2549
01:39:58,660 --> 01:39:59,260
That's not bad.

2550
01:40:03,400 --> 01:40:04,040
Wow.

2551
01:40:04,120 --> 01:40:04,900
Nice parry.

2552
01:40:05,080 --> 01:40:05,400
Oh.

2553
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:10,080
Can I smash?

2554
01:40:11,660 --> 01:40:12,300
Oh.

2555
01:40:13,780 --> 01:40:14,420
Nice.

2556
01:40:21,020 --> 01:40:21,660
Nice.

2557
01:40:21,660 --> 01:40:21,960
Nice.

2558
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:22,500
Nice.

2559
01:40:28,680 --> 01:40:29,600
Nice.

2560
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:29,600
Thanks,

2561
01:40:33,340 --> 01:40:33,340
guys.

2562
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:38,440
Thank you.

2563
01:40:38,440 --> 01:40:38,680
Thanks.

2564
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:40,100
I'm gonna push.

2565
01:40:40,100 --> 01:40:40,960
Oh, this is the first level.

2566
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:41,800
I'm gonna push.

2567
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:42,220
See, this is the first level.

2568
01:40:42,220 --> 01:40:45,560
I'm gonna take a side attack along with this first one.

2569
01:40:45,860 --> 01:40:46,780
So, this is the first level.

2570
01:40:46,780 --> 01:40:46,880
This is the first one.

2571
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:46,900
Nice.

2572
01:40:46,900 --> 01:40:47,640
Come

2573
01:40:51,310 --> 01:40:52,550
on, all of us.

2574
01:40:52,550 --> 01:40:52,910
We can really play like this.

2575
01:40:52,910 --> 01:40:53,730
We can really play like this.

2576
01:40:53,950 --> 01:40:54,870
Okay.

2577
01:40:56,430 --> 01:40:58,270
Let's go.

2578
01:40:58,270 --> 01:40:58,650
Guess what bro?

2579
01:40:58,910 --> 01:41:03,690
I dress up like... I dress up with a fucking... a mustache and a revolver.

2580
01:41:04,230 --> 01:41:05,590
I'm supposed to come up!

2581
01:41:13,990 --> 01:41:15,290
What a break.

2582
01:41:25,580 --> 01:41:26,100
Nice!

2583
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:46,420
I think I got him.

2584
01:41:47,700 --> 01:41:50,000
I got him.

2585
01:41:50,220 --> 01:41:50,960
Yeah, no!

2586
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:53,300
Dude, I'm gonna lose my mind.

2587
01:41:53,900 --> 01:41:54,780
That was so close.

2588
01:41:54,780 --> 01:41:55,800
I hate this fucking character.

2589
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:01,020
I'll try to go for the ring.

2590
01:42:01,200 --> 01:42:01,760
He's smart.

2591
01:42:02,020 --> 01:42:03,400
He could have a better move up off that.

2592
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:04,960
What the fuck is that?

2593
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:07,500
That's to stop you from mashing.

2594
01:42:08,760 --> 01:42:10,460
Even though what he did was unsafe.

2595
01:42:16,220 --> 01:42:17,760
So he's confused too.

2596
01:42:36,260 --> 01:42:41,600
What a comeback!

2597
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:42,800
Nice, dude, he's good.

2598
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:45,400
See, he's showing all his cards now.

2599
01:42:45,580 --> 01:42:46,760
We know how he plays now.

2600
01:43:03,060 --> 01:43:04,240
Get the fuck up!

2601
01:43:04,300 --> 01:43:05,820
Why can't I fucking get up, dude?

2602
01:43:33,570 --> 01:43:39,190
I was blocking low too, I did a long time.

2603
01:43:39,190 --> 01:43:39,830
Yeah, I saw it.

2604
01:43:39,930 --> 01:43:40,270
You knew.

2605
01:43:40,430 --> 01:43:42,170
What a miserable character to play against.

2606
01:43:42,610 --> 01:43:44,310
Yeah, that was horrific.

2607
01:43:44,550 --> 01:43:45,670
There's just nothing...

2608
01:43:47,450 --> 01:43:49,150
That's a good-ass player though.

2609
01:43:49,290 --> 01:43:50,150
He's just a good player.

2610
01:43:50,150 --> 01:43:50,910
Yeah, he knows the matchup.

2611
01:43:51,130 --> 01:43:53,670
Yeah, it's just a matchup we'll work on.

2612
01:43:53,750 --> 01:43:54,030
That's all.

2613
01:43:55,710 --> 01:43:57,610
Yeah, we'll go over that whole matchup, dude.

2614
01:43:57,610 --> 01:43:58,090
Now you know his playstyle.

2615
01:43:59,650 --> 01:44:01,150
You're right though, that did look miserable.

2616
01:44:01,310 --> 01:44:02,810
Especially for Bear in particular.

2617
01:44:02,830 --> 01:44:05,610
Like, I don't know when he's gonna... I just don't.

2618
01:44:05,630 --> 01:44:06,810
Dude, this guy's playing Eddy.

2619
01:44:07,050 --> 01:44:08,830
I know for a fact he's playing Eddy.

2620
01:44:12,590 --> 01:44:13,570
Hold on, I gotta get out of here.

2621
01:44:15,190 --> 01:44:18,130
Not this old ass, this 60 year old man!

2622
01:44:18,670 --> 01:44:19,870
What a f- come on, that man!

2623
01:44:19,870 --> 01:44:22,330
Okay, we just wanted Brawl Pro to be able to have a match as well.

2624
01:44:22,710 --> 01:44:23,670
Put him in a home!

2625
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:28,400
Alright, I'm gonna try.

2626
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:28,860
Here we go.

2627
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:35,780
If I see some like, some obvious stuff, then I will let you know.

2628
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:39,680
I don't wanna interrupt your game though.

2629
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:40,560
Unless it's obvious.

2630
01:44:41,020 --> 01:44:41,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2631
01:44:41,820 --> 01:44:43,920
I mean, you just do whatever you need to.

2632
01:44:45,320 --> 01:44:49,100
Whatever you feel like is like... he obviously is not picking up on this.

2633
01:44:52,280 --> 01:44:53,480
I fucking told you!

2634
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:54,560
What the fuck did I say?

2635
01:44:55,020 --> 01:44:55,880
Zafina my ass.

2636
01:44:56,200 --> 01:44:57,100
Zafina my ass.

2637
01:44:57,540 --> 01:44:58,900
Were you prepped for Zafina?

2638
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:01,240
No, I'm not prepped for either character.

2639
01:45:03,240 --> 01:45:04,780
He's about to play his theme song.

2640
01:45:14,340 --> 01:45:15,520
Oh my god.

2641
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:18,980
Fuck, I didn't get his strike.

2642
01:45:19,560 --> 01:45:21,240
You don't need prep, look at you!

2643
01:45:22,620 --> 01:45:24,320
Cyborg Eddy is so funny.

2644
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:26,400
He's like trying.

2645
01:45:27,460 --> 01:45:28,960
What a punish, dude.

2646
01:45:29,120 --> 01:45:32,320
Cyborg Eddy would be like a Metal Gear boss, right?

2647
01:45:32,440 --> 01:45:32,800
Like...

2648
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:36,020
Dancing cat, like...

2649
01:45:36,020 --> 01:45:36,660
That's the name.

2650
01:45:37,240 --> 01:45:37,840
Fight!

2651
01:45:38,160 --> 01:45:38,900
It's the game!

2652
01:45:39,660 --> 01:45:40,260
Aquara!

2653
01:45:42,780 --> 01:45:43,380
Brawl!

2654
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:44,000
Yeah!

2655
01:45:44,980 --> 01:45:45,340
Suck it!

2656
01:45:46,180 --> 01:45:47,160
Okay, that's fair.

2657
01:45:49,160 --> 01:45:50,760
I thought you said I get that forward too there!

2658
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:52,240
You can.

2659
01:45:52,780 --> 01:45:53,500
I tried.

2660
01:45:53,620 --> 01:45:57,620
It feels kinda laggy and I've never complained about lag before, hasn't it?

2661
01:45:59,580 --> 01:46:00,560
Secretly on Wi-Fi?

2662
01:46:01,120 --> 01:46:02,780
The foul wind of the snout.

2663
01:46:04,640 --> 01:46:05,800
That's what Doki was trying to do.

2664
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:07,920
He had the wired connection going to a wireless router.

2665
01:46:11,020 --> 01:46:13,120
He just unplugged the ethernet cable.

2666
01:46:14,260 --> 01:46:15,320
Is it Apple?

2667
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:16,060
After the dive?

2668
01:46:17,460 --> 01:46:19,040
Where he tries to take his plus eight?

2669
01:46:19,120 --> 01:46:19,920
Where I can down forward too?

2670
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:23,780
After down forward, it's just a fake out move.

2671
01:46:24,700 --> 01:46:25,500
I'll show you.

2672
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:26,500
When he does it, I'll mention it.

2673
01:46:31,880 --> 01:46:32,260
Backslash.

2674
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:33,900
Oh.

2675
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:35,520
Why is it laggy?

2676
01:46:37,300 --> 01:46:38,020
I don't know.

2677
01:46:39,460 --> 01:46:40,620
Maybe it's because he's on console.

2678
01:46:43,500 --> 01:46:44,820
I swear, dude.

2679
01:46:46,420 --> 01:46:46,800
Okay.

2680
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:47,020
It's clean.

2681
01:46:48,240 --> 01:46:50,060
He doesn't feel like shit though.

2682
01:46:51,880 --> 01:46:53,020
Oh yeah, it's airborne shit.

2683
01:47:02,340 --> 01:47:03,100
Oh, nice!

2684
01:47:04,640 --> 01:47:05,760
Nice aggression, man.

2685
01:47:20,350 --> 01:47:20,730
That.

2686
01:47:22,050 --> 01:47:23,050
I need to lav it.

2687
01:47:23,210 --> 01:47:24,250
Why is it so laggy?

2688
01:47:25,190 --> 01:47:26,830
Is it like it's slow-mo for you guys?

2689
01:47:26,970 --> 01:47:27,230
Yeah, it is.

2690
01:47:27,850 --> 01:47:28,990
Yeah, it is a little.

2691
01:47:29,110 --> 01:47:29,310
Yeah.

2692
01:47:30,790 --> 01:47:31,950
All right, lock in.

2693
01:47:32,010 --> 01:47:32,290
Lock in.

2694
01:47:33,930 --> 01:47:34,270
Two.

2695
01:47:35,530 --> 01:47:36,070
Three.

2696
01:47:36,210 --> 01:47:37,250
And I'm gonna do that.

2697
01:47:38,470 --> 01:47:39,430
Yeah, that's.

2698
01:47:39,430 --> 01:47:41,310
It is, yeah.

2699
01:47:44,010 --> 01:47:44,830
That's strange.

2700
01:47:45,030 --> 01:47:47,110
Bro bursted out the lag switch.

2701
01:47:49,310 --> 01:47:50,610
It feels chunky.

2702
01:47:50,910 --> 01:47:51,810
I don't like it.

2703
01:47:53,530 --> 01:47:55,350
It's the one with the Ethernet cable.

2704
01:47:59,870 --> 01:48:01,230
Lips and eyes don't go again.

2705
01:48:04,070 --> 01:48:04,610
Nice.

2706
01:48:04,790 --> 01:48:05,290
Okay.

2707
01:48:05,290 --> 01:48:05,950
Launch!

2708
01:48:09,270 --> 01:48:10,230
Oh nice!

2709
01:48:13,270 --> 01:48:15,810
The combo makes me so anxious because it looks like...

2710
01:48:15,810 --> 01:48:16,190
Oh my...

2711
01:48:16,190 --> 01:48:19,490
I did not mean to...

2712
01:48:19,490 --> 01:48:22,350
His throw breaks are pretty weak though.

2713
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:39,120
Good shit.

2714
01:48:39,260 --> 01:48:40,140
Job spot Nick.

2715
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:44,520
I'm okay with this.

2716
01:48:45,580 --> 01:48:47,160
You do kinda deserve it.

2717
01:48:48,140 --> 01:48:49,200
I'm okay with this.

2718
01:48:49,880 --> 01:48:51,620
Are you still okay with it?

2719
01:48:51,780 --> 01:48:53,360
Are you still okay?

2720
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:54,960
Are you still okay?

2721
01:48:56,500 --> 01:48:57,020
What?

2722
01:48:57,480 --> 01:48:58,840
Nice, nice, nice.

2723
01:48:58,900 --> 01:49:00,780
Why did that track?

2724
01:49:00,820 --> 01:49:01,540
It tracked.

2725
01:49:03,060 --> 01:49:04,400
It's a full 360.

2726
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:07,980
Bro, thank you morgon.

2727
01:49:11,720 --> 01:49:12,240
Nice.

2728
01:49:12,240 --> 01:49:12,500
Yeah!

2729
01:49:14,040 --> 01:49:15,500
Did this controller DC?

2730
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:16,340
I don't know.

2731
01:49:16,540 --> 01:49:18,580
This is such a weird fucking game.

2732
01:49:18,600 --> 01:49:18,920
It did.

2733
01:49:19,020 --> 01:49:19,640
I'm taking it.

2734
01:49:19,960 --> 01:49:20,360
I'm taking it.

2735
01:49:20,500 --> 01:49:21,400
Take it, take it!

2736
01:49:22,200 --> 01:49:23,800
There's no fair fight attacking!

2737
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:25,040
Oh wait, no!

2738
01:49:25,080 --> 01:49:25,680
He's on...

2739
01:49:25,680 --> 01:49:26,140
No!

2740
01:49:26,580 --> 01:49:27,880
He plugged it back in!

2741
01:49:28,160 --> 01:49:29,140
He's playing Clash of...

2742
01:49:30,420 --> 01:49:32,140
He plugged in the mouse and keyboard!

2743
01:49:34,460 --> 01:49:35,680
It's on a different controller.

2744
01:49:35,940 --> 01:49:37,420
He's on a different... I'm playing!

2745
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:39,300
I was playing on his Alexa!

2746
01:49:39,820 --> 01:49:41,180
It's on his Switch now!

2747
01:49:45,820 --> 01:49:46,340
Yep.

2748
01:49:46,420 --> 01:49:46,780
Boom!

2749
01:49:46,860 --> 01:49:48,960
Yeah, that's definitely Switch gameplay there.

2750
01:49:50,520 --> 01:49:52,740
It's like chunky, dude.

2751
01:49:53,260 --> 01:49:54,560
He's the strongest!

2752
01:49:59,560 --> 01:50:01,940
So after he does the dive...

2753
01:50:01,940 --> 01:50:03,280
I don't fucking... whatever.

2754
01:50:03,480 --> 01:50:04,040
You know what?

2755
01:50:04,100 --> 01:50:04,700
I'm down back one.

2756
01:50:05,460 --> 01:50:05,980
Fight!

2757
01:50:15,710 --> 01:50:16,550
Oh launch!

2758
01:50:16,630 --> 01:50:16,770
Oh!

2759
01:50:18,290 --> 01:50:19,330
That move.

2760
01:50:19,730 --> 01:50:20,450
That low.

2761
01:50:21,230 --> 01:50:21,710
That.

2762
01:50:22,450 --> 01:50:22,930
Fuck!

2763
01:50:23,030 --> 01:50:24,110
It's hard to tell, bro.

2764
01:50:24,350 --> 01:50:24,830
Yeah.

2765
01:50:25,190 --> 01:50:26,010
I'm sorry!

2766
01:50:28,070 --> 01:50:28,550
Nice!

2767
01:50:33,050 --> 01:50:33,850
Nice grab.

2768
01:50:34,190 --> 01:50:34,590
That was good.

2769
01:50:35,470 --> 01:50:36,250
Bro's got kicks.

2770
01:50:40,610 --> 01:50:41,530
There's probably one more.

2771
01:50:41,710 --> 01:50:42,830
You're cra... what?

2772
01:50:42,930 --> 01:50:44,830
That was a crazy move to start with.

2773
01:50:45,970 --> 01:50:46,450
Yeah.

2774
01:50:47,370 --> 01:50:48,310
Doki knows too.

2775
01:50:48,550 --> 01:50:49,030
Yeah!

2776
01:50:49,150 --> 01:50:51,170
If I knew that he'd end it's bad!

2777
01:50:56,830 --> 01:50:57,830
Just watch the sweep.

2778
01:51:03,940 --> 01:51:06,480
Yeah, he's sweeping like crazy, dude.

2779
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:08,460
Just sit and wait.

2780
01:51:08,660 --> 01:51:09,320
Cash out.

2781
01:51:09,740 --> 01:51:10,140
I hate it.

2782
01:51:10,780 --> 01:51:11,180
Fight!

2783
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:15,600
Ooh.

2784
01:51:17,900 --> 01:51:18,660
Why the fuck?

2785
01:51:24,280 --> 01:51:25,300
I don't get it.

2786
01:51:25,460 --> 01:51:26,060
You're serious, Gary.

2787
01:51:26,060 --> 01:51:26,480
I don't know...

2788
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:27,420
What the fuck?

2789
01:51:27,640 --> 01:51:28,340
I don't know, Eddie.

2790
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:28,800
I don't know, Eddie.

2791
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:29,160
I don't know.

2792
01:51:29,200 --> 01:51:29,460
I don't know.

2793
01:51:30,100 --> 01:51:31,740
Dude, he's spinning around!

2794
01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:33,180
I don't know, Eddie.

2795
01:51:33,260 --> 01:51:33,720
I don't know, Eddie.

2796
01:51:33,780 --> 01:51:34,840
I literally don't know, Eddie.

2797
01:51:34,940 --> 01:51:36,060
Fucking let it rip!

2798
01:51:38,200 --> 01:51:39,740
He should have a dizzy meter.

2799
01:51:39,740 --> 01:51:41,040
Dude, I've never seen this before.

2800
01:51:41,320 --> 01:51:44,100
He should have a dizzy meter and if it fills up, he vomits.

2801
01:51:45,100 --> 01:51:46,600
Somebody stop this man.

2802
01:51:46,980 --> 01:51:47,360
This shit...

2803
01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:47,360
nobody can do this.

2804
01:51:47,400 --> 01:51:49,020
Nobody can do this for real, Eddie.

2805
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:49,780
No, human alive.

2806
01:51:50,540 --> 01:51:51,680
What a launch.

2807
01:51:51,920 --> 01:51:52,720
Dizzy meter?

2808
01:51:52,860 --> 01:51:53,560
Bro, that's incredible.

2809
01:51:54,360 --> 01:51:55,320
Dizzy meter.

2810
01:51:55,440 --> 01:51:57,960
Just bring back all the stamina bar.

2811
01:51:57,960 --> 01:52:00,080
If it fills, he has a 360 frame bomb.

2812
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:00,480
He's vomiting animation.

2813
01:52:02,040 --> 01:52:04,720
Bring back the stamina bar at this point as well.

2814
01:52:06,240 --> 01:52:06,900
Stamina bar!

2815
01:52:08,680 --> 01:52:09,540
Eddie's tired!

2816
01:52:10,200 --> 01:52:11,120
He's tired!

2817
01:52:11,320 --> 01:52:12,200
He needs some rest.

2818
01:52:13,540 --> 01:52:15,660
He breathes like Mario when he has red health.

2819
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:16,320
He's like, woohoo!

2820
01:52:23,630 --> 01:52:25,190
I've been lied to by my coach.

2821
01:52:25,930 --> 01:52:26,730
Dude, what the fuck?

2822
01:52:26,730 --> 01:52:27,390
You guys are the fuck?

2823
01:52:28,830 --> 01:52:29,810
Nah, I've been lied to.

2824
01:52:29,930 --> 01:52:30,270
I've been lied to.

2825
01:52:30,350 --> 01:52:30,810
I've been lied to.

2826
01:52:30,910 --> 01:52:30,950
See, right?

2827
01:52:30,950 --> 01:52:31,690
It's our coach's fault.

2828
01:52:32,050 --> 01:52:32,770
You're dead.

2829
01:52:33,010 --> 01:52:33,350
I'm dead.

2830
01:52:33,370 --> 01:52:34,270
I'm not dead.

2831
01:52:34,310 --> 01:52:34,550
Wow.

2832
01:52:34,850 --> 01:52:36,810
He's been paid off by Big Feedy X.

2833
01:52:37,950 --> 01:52:39,370
Quick, unplug his controller.

2834
01:52:40,290 --> 01:52:42,490
What's the most damage possible from the Rage Art?

2835
01:52:43,090 --> 01:52:44,110
No, he was airborne.

2836
01:52:44,510 --> 01:52:45,370
Oh, Jesus.

2837
01:52:45,730 --> 01:52:46,930
Now you still see how much he does.

2838
01:52:47,310 --> 01:52:47,750
Oh!

2839
01:52:49,230 --> 01:52:49,670
Okay.

2840
01:52:50,370 --> 01:52:51,030
That's good.

2841
01:52:51,970 --> 01:52:52,410
What?

2842
01:52:52,630 --> 01:52:52,910
Oh!

2843
01:52:53,310 --> 01:52:53,750
What?

2844
01:52:53,950 --> 01:52:54,910
Watch the Rage Art.

2845
01:52:56,310 --> 01:52:56,750
Oh!

2846
01:52:56,810 --> 01:52:57,250
No!

2847
01:52:58,670 --> 01:52:59,370
Let's fuck this!

2848
01:52:59,370 --> 01:53:00,310
Oh, baby!

2849
01:53:00,690 --> 01:53:01,230
Let's go!

2850
01:53:01,490 --> 01:53:01,970
Let's go!

2851
01:53:02,050 --> 01:53:02,470
Let's go!

2852
01:53:02,690 --> 01:53:02,970
Let's go!

2853
01:53:03,370 --> 01:53:03,630
Oh my god!

2854
01:53:03,670 --> 01:53:04,150
The coming!

2855
01:53:04,150 --> 01:53:04,470
He's the strongest!

2856
01:53:04,910 --> 01:53:06,690
What the fuck I'm talking about?

2857
01:53:06,950 --> 01:53:07,250
Let's fucking go!

2858
01:53:07,250 --> 01:53:09,390
If you joined the sling, you would defeat everyone?

2859
01:53:09,590 --> 01:53:10,550
You're fucking right!

2860
01:53:11,370 --> 01:53:11,890
Whoa!

2861
01:53:12,250 --> 01:53:12,770
What?

2862
01:53:13,310 --> 01:53:15,190
He didn't need a prep for him.

2863
01:53:15,590 --> 01:53:16,490
Also, GG.

2864
01:53:16,570 --> 01:53:17,270
That was really fun.

2865
01:53:17,350 --> 01:53:18,770
Jesus with a Neuralink.

2866
01:53:18,870 --> 01:53:20,190
Jesus with a Neuralink.

2867
01:53:20,330 --> 01:53:20,630
Amazing.

2868
01:53:20,650 --> 01:53:20,970
That's right.

2869
01:53:21,470 --> 01:53:23,470
He didn't even need to fucking prepare.

2870
01:53:25,310 --> 01:53:25,830
Whew.

2871
01:53:25,930 --> 01:53:26,670
What almost left the...

2872
01:53:26,670 --> 01:53:28,890
We're lapping the Eddie matchup, bro.

2873
01:53:29,310 --> 01:53:32,150
That was me fighting without any Eddie knowledge.

2874
01:53:32,290 --> 01:53:32,410
Who is this?

2875
01:53:32,630 --> 01:53:33,050
Who is this?

2876
01:53:33,050 --> 01:53:33,310
Who is this?

2877
01:53:33,310 --> 01:53:33,350
Who is this?

2878
01:53:36,170 --> 01:53:39,350
Dude, I think if you just block low a lot...

2879
01:53:39,350 --> 01:53:39,690
Wait, guys.

2880
01:53:39,850 --> 01:53:40,910
Who is this guy?

2881
01:53:41,130 --> 01:53:41,790
Who is this?

2882
01:53:42,310 --> 01:53:43,030
I think that's...

2883
01:53:43,030 --> 01:53:43,890
Is that not...

2884
01:53:43,890 --> 01:53:45,270
I thought this was FDX's team.

2885
01:53:45,490 --> 01:53:47,130
That's FDX, the Tekken King Reina.

2886
01:53:47,190 --> 01:53:47,530
Don't you know?

2887
01:53:49,370 --> 01:53:50,310
He's working on it.

2888
01:53:50,990 --> 01:53:51,970
He's working on the Reina.

2889
01:53:52,770 --> 01:53:54,950
Is he bringing the Reina or is he fucking with you?

2890
01:53:56,850 --> 01:53:59,690
This guy beat Justin Wong, so I'm gonna need you to lock in.

2891
01:53:59,770 --> 01:54:00,030
He's good.

2892
01:54:00,130 --> 01:54:00,510
He's good.

2893
01:54:03,410 --> 01:54:05,390
There's a lot of people in our lobby.

2894
01:54:05,390 --> 01:54:06,070
No, that's him.

2895
01:54:06,330 --> 01:54:07,690
Wait, who is the Reina?

2896
01:54:09,630 --> 01:54:11,370
Just lost in the wrong lobby.

2897
01:54:12,390 --> 01:54:14,390
Who the fuck was that guy?

2898
01:54:14,410 --> 01:54:16,510
Wait, did somebody leave the coders?

2899
01:54:16,590 --> 01:54:18,330
There's a lot of people joining in.

2900
01:54:18,690 --> 01:54:20,170
That's like the ghost of Marvel.

2901
01:54:20,370 --> 01:54:21,610
You gotta play me.

2902
01:54:22,450 --> 01:54:23,430
Yeah, dude.

2903
01:54:23,830 --> 01:54:24,770
Oh my god.

2904
01:54:24,790 --> 01:54:25,630
I love that guy.

2905
01:54:25,910 --> 01:54:26,610
That's one of the...

2906
01:54:26,610 --> 01:54:30,070
That's one of my top five FGC clips all time.

2907
01:54:30,110 --> 01:54:30,490
That's one of the top five FGC clips all time.

2908
01:54:31,630 --> 01:54:32,630
Nobody stopped him.

2909
01:54:33,250 --> 01:54:33,610
Nobody stopped him.

2910
01:54:33,610 --> 01:54:35,170
He got all the way up to Chris G.

2911
01:54:35,650 --> 01:54:36,010
It's so funny.

2912
01:54:36,010 --> 01:54:36,690
All the way up to him.

2913
01:54:36,810 --> 01:54:39,970
Because so many people watch that and they're like, how did nobody stop him?

2914
01:54:40,030 --> 01:54:43,010
And people who are like in eSports production are like, oh, I get it.

2915
01:54:43,270 --> 01:54:45,150
Like, yeah, right.

2916
01:54:52,200 --> 01:54:53,200
FD is malding?

2917
01:54:53,400 --> 01:54:55,220
Why are there so many people in the lobby?

2918
01:54:55,300 --> 01:54:55,840
Who leaked it?

2919
01:54:55,960 --> 01:54:56,180
Who leaked it?

2920
01:54:56,180 --> 01:54:56,780
I would mald it.

2921
01:54:57,580 --> 01:54:58,440
I would mald it.

2922
01:54:58,440 --> 01:54:59,040
V said that.

2923
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:01,820
V said he didn't make a public one.

2924
01:55:02,260 --> 01:55:02,620
So...

2925
01:55:02,620 --> 01:55:04,380
I mean, he didn't make a private lobby.

2926
01:55:04,540 --> 01:55:04,940
So...

2927
01:55:04,940 --> 01:55:08,460
I think people just like fouled our lobby.

2928
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:10,080
We got all these fuckers.

2929
01:55:10,360 --> 01:55:12,820
When I fucked it up, at least I made it private.

2930
01:55:12,900 --> 01:55:13,440
You know what I mean?

2931
01:55:14,340 --> 01:55:14,780
True.

2932
01:55:19,060 --> 01:55:20,500
I was like, I don't...

2933
01:55:20,500 --> 01:55:22,420
These are too many names.

2934
01:55:23,360 --> 01:55:23,800
I think

2935
01:55:39,370 --> 01:55:42,030
he's asleep for two hours.

2936
01:55:43,530 --> 01:55:43,970
Oh.

2937
01:55:44,890 --> 01:55:46,790
This is a concussion for sure.

2938
01:55:47,010 --> 01:55:48,850
This actually damages him into the next round.

2939
01:55:49,750 --> 01:55:50,190
He's sleeping.

2940
01:55:50,190 --> 01:55:50,550
It's true.

2941
01:55:50,710 --> 01:55:51,150
He's sleeping.

2942
01:55:51,190 --> 01:55:51,530
It's true.

2943
01:55:51,610 --> 01:55:51,830
He's sleeping.

2944
01:55:52,330 --> 01:55:52,770
Ouch.

2945
01:56:06,840 --> 01:56:07,280
Oh.

2946
01:56:22,220 --> 01:56:22,660
What?

2947
01:56:22,840 --> 01:56:25,480
I didn't know that low kick was lit.

2948
01:56:25,680 --> 01:56:26,360
That's crazy.

2949
01:56:30,420 --> 01:56:30,860
What?

2950
01:56:33,120 --> 01:56:34,820
I mean, this character won evo so it's not your fault.

2951
01:56:36,500 --> 01:56:40,660
You're just playing off meta, you know?

2952
01:56:40,680 --> 01:56:40,900
Yeah.

2953
01:56:40,900 --> 01:56:42,520
Look at this.

2954
01:56:50,020 --> 01:56:52,240
We're just giving her a free round, right?

2955
01:56:54,620 --> 01:56:58,440
Oh my god, I know how to do that move!

2956
01:57:16,760 --> 01:57:19,100
That's a fucking awesome rage art.

2957
01:57:22,060 --> 01:57:22,460
Beat him!

2958
01:57:37,630 --> 01:57:38,350
That's mental.

2959
01:57:38,590 --> 01:57:39,650
You're welcome Brawl Pro.

2960
01:57:40,190 --> 01:57:41,590
SpeedyDex is like, I can't believe you did that.

2961
01:57:41,650 --> 01:57:42,930
I just can't believe you did that.

2962
01:57:44,110 --> 01:57:44,830
He's raging!

2963
01:57:56,320 --> 01:57:56,680
Nice.

2964
01:58:00,240 --> 01:58:01,560
Don't worry, I'll be able to do that too.

2965
01:58:02,940 --> 01:58:03,660
Bounce... and...

2966
01:58:04,160 --> 01:58:04,520
drop.

2967
01:58:07,400 --> 01:58:08,440
Oh no.

2968
01:58:09,080 --> 01:58:09,640
Oh no.

2969
01:58:20,720 --> 01:58:21,280
Oh!

2970
01:58:26,410 --> 01:58:27,950
Oh my god!

2971
01:58:28,110 --> 01:58:28,670
Oh my god!

2972
01:58:28,950 --> 01:58:31,230
What are you looking at?

2973
01:58:32,190 --> 01:58:33,750
There's no pain over there!

2974
01:58:33,990 --> 01:58:34,750
That was so sick.

2975
01:58:35,530 --> 01:58:36,450
That was crazy.

2976
01:58:36,850 --> 01:58:40,010
That's genuinely the closest thing to the mango that you can get in this game.

2977
01:58:40,930 --> 01:58:44,330
The literal perfect optimal back turn punish.

2978
01:58:44,650 --> 01:58:45,990
That's legacy as fuck.

2979
01:58:47,230 --> 01:58:47,790
Oh!

2980
01:58:48,510 --> 01:58:49,130
Uh oh.

2981
01:58:51,630 --> 01:58:53,010
Yeah bro is laying down.

2982
01:59:00,340 --> 01:59:00,900
Damn.

2983
01:59:02,020 --> 01:59:02,760
That's a lot.

2984
01:59:03,400 --> 01:59:03,960
Okay.

2985
01:59:04,460 --> 01:59:05,900
Counter hit giant swing dealer.

2986
01:59:06,040 --> 01:59:06,540
Does he no detect?

2987
01:59:08,220 --> 01:59:09,440
I don't think so.

2988
01:59:10,460 --> 01:59:11,020
Imagine.

2989
01:59:13,060 --> 01:59:14,460
It's a god of destruction thing.

2990
01:59:15,420 --> 01:59:16,480
It's like, are you detecting?

2991
01:59:16,800 --> 01:59:17,080
Are you seeing?

2992
01:59:18,540 --> 01:59:19,300
Oh my god.

2993
01:59:19,500 --> 01:59:22,800
Break the stage so I can do that move you've been yelling at me to do.

2994
01:59:27,210 --> 01:59:27,990
Good grab.

2995
01:59:28,610 --> 01:59:30,210
Ain't no way he's not breaking ones.

2996
01:59:34,760 --> 01:59:35,680
Nina has that move.

2997
01:59:36,700 --> 01:59:37,140
Nice!

2998
01:59:37,280 --> 01:59:37,980
Nina, our friend.

2999
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:38,760
Love that.

3000
01:59:38,920 --> 01:59:39,400
No way!

3001
01:59:39,400 --> 01:59:40,480
Let's hit one B!

3002
01:59:41,600 --> 01:59:43,480
He's scared of the 1 plus 2 though.

3003
01:59:43,480 --> 01:59:45,660
Oh my goodness!

3004
01:59:46,080 --> 01:59:46,340
Oh!

3005
01:59:46,560 --> 01:59:48,360
Did you hear the chump on that?

3006
01:59:48,540 --> 01:59:48,880
Yeah.

3007
01:59:51,640 --> 01:59:53,200
Keep doing it.

3008
01:59:53,260 --> 01:59:53,840
She doesn't learn.

3009
01:59:55,840 --> 01:59:56,880
Boom boom.

3010
01:59:57,020 --> 01:59:57,740
Spin around.

3011
01:59:58,760 --> 02:00:00,080
Look at the ball coach.

3012
02:00:00,540 --> 02:00:01,540
Bounce coach!

3013
02:00:02,380 --> 02:00:03,620
Break the stage!

3014
02:00:04,140 --> 02:00:05,360
Oh hell no!

3015
02:00:05,560 --> 02:00:06,420
What the fuck!

3016
02:00:09,020 --> 02:00:10,200
It's still going.

3017
02:00:10,340 --> 02:00:11,300
It's still fucking going.

3018
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:15,020
Oh stop.

3019
02:00:15,240 --> 02:00:16,000
How dare you.

3020
02:00:17,080 --> 02:00:18,240
Oh wow.

3021
02:00:18,400 --> 02:00:19,180
I hate that game.

3022
02:00:22,600 --> 02:00:23,960
No revenge.

3023
02:00:25,160 --> 02:00:25,840
Damn.

3024
02:00:26,620 --> 02:00:28,160
Oh those are faked.

3025
02:00:34,010 --> 02:00:35,570
That's launch bro.

3026
02:00:38,070 --> 02:00:38,750
Oh!

3027
02:00:39,670 --> 02:00:40,350
Nice.

3028
02:00:42,190 --> 02:00:43,650
Send him in a one touch.

3029
02:00:43,990 --> 02:00:45,410
Is that fully KO?

3030
02:00:45,970 --> 02:00:46,650
No.

3031
02:00:47,770 --> 02:00:49,310
It scales down a lot.

3032
02:00:49,470 --> 02:00:50,850
Cause she's in the air right?

3033
02:00:51,050 --> 02:00:51,750
It's one mix.

3034
02:00:52,290 --> 02:00:55,310
It just doesn't scale well during combos.

3035
02:00:56,070 --> 02:00:56,830
Huge break.

3036
02:00:57,810 --> 02:00:58,750
Time for a little gaming.

3037
02:01:00,070 --> 02:01:00,830
Wait it out.

3038
02:01:01,330 --> 02:01:02,530
No don't wait it out.

3039
02:01:03,210 --> 02:01:03,850
Damn it.

3040
02:01:04,390 --> 02:01:04,870
No!

3041
02:01:07,130 --> 02:01:08,090
Very close.

3042
02:01:09,570 --> 02:01:11,350
Now you're in my house.

3043
02:01:11,750 --> 02:01:13,170
Ping should be able to run backwards.

3044
02:01:14,450 --> 02:01:16,090
I got you for three minutes.

3045
02:01:16,890 --> 02:01:17,370
Three minutes.

3046
02:01:17,730 --> 02:01:18,070
Three minutes.

3047
02:01:20,730 --> 02:01:22,590
Bro pro is ready.

3048
02:01:23,130 --> 02:01:26,270
Bro pro

3049
02:01:38,490 --> 02:01:38,490
is ready.

3050
02:01:38,490 --> 02:01:38,990
Nice.

3051
02:01:39,230 --> 02:01:39,870
What a call.

3052
02:01:39,970 --> 02:01:40,210
Good shit.

3053
02:01:42,570 --> 02:01:44,070
Oh damn it.

3054
02:01:44,110 --> 02:01:44,770
She ducked it.

3055
02:01:44,990 --> 02:01:45,750
She's dead.

3056
02:01:46,030 --> 02:01:46,710
Nice!

3057
02:01:49,030 --> 02:01:50,510
Never rage arts.

3058
02:01:54,330 --> 02:01:55,550
Oh nice.

3059
02:01:55,650 --> 02:01:56,050
Oh my god.

3060
02:01:56,050 --> 02:01:56,990
Hey what if this is guaranteed?

3061
02:01:56,990 --> 02:01:57,910
What if this is guaranteed?

3062
02:01:58,150 --> 02:01:58,330
Oh.

3063
02:02:00,430 --> 02:02:02,450
What if they call them freaky king?

3064
02:02:03,090 --> 02:02:04,010
Freaky king.

3065
02:02:05,230 --> 02:02:07,110
What if they call it freaky A?

3066
02:02:15,780 --> 02:02:16,820
He ducked.

3067
02:02:17,120 --> 02:02:18,600
He actually ducked.

3068
02:02:18,600 --> 02:02:19,100
It's fine.

3069
02:02:21,460 --> 02:02:22,940
He's playing with his food.

3070
02:02:25,600 --> 02:02:26,380
Break man.

3071
02:02:26,900 --> 02:02:27,400
Yeah!

3072
02:02:28,320 --> 02:02:29,500
He was gaming.

3073
02:02:29,540 --> 02:02:30,280
Let's go!

3074
02:02:30,720 --> 02:02:32,580
That was fucking fun to watch.

3075
02:02:32,680 --> 02:02:33,320
Let's go coach.

3076
02:02:33,500 --> 02:02:33,840
Good shit.

3077
02:02:33,960 --> 02:02:37,280
I'll be able to do that in three days guys.

3078
02:02:38,740 --> 02:02:39,580
Hell yeah.

3079
02:02:41,540 --> 02:02:46,260
Dude that one round where you guys just 80%ed each other back and forth was...

3080
02:02:46,260 --> 02:02:47,400
That was sick.

3081
02:02:47,440 --> 02:02:48,020
That was sick.

3082
02:02:48,800 --> 02:02:50,580
Non stop combos forever.

3083
02:02:51,340 --> 02:02:52,340
Good shit dude.

3084
02:02:52,340 --> 02:02:54,160
That was the hard team by the way.

3085
02:02:54,220 --> 02:02:55,420
They won 4-1.

3086
02:02:55,660 --> 02:02:58,060
And now we beat them what 3-2 I think?

3087
02:02:59,300 --> 02:03:02,000
That was the hardest team in the whole tournament.

3088
02:03:02,400 --> 02:03:02,440
I'm so happy man.

3089
02:03:02,620 --> 02:03:07,460
I lost the last coach match so I'm glad I won this one.

3090
02:03:07,980 --> 02:03:09,580
Had to bring it back for the team.

3091
02:03:10,700 --> 02:03:11,180
Okay.

3092
02:03:12,080 --> 02:03:13,240
That was fun as well.

3093
02:03:13,600 --> 02:03:14,280
Good set.

3094
02:03:14,720 --> 02:03:15,920
That was fun yeah.

3095
02:03:17,220 --> 02:03:20,360
I'll remember the time I took two rounds off SK forever.

3096
02:03:21,080 --> 02:03:21,560
Hehehe.

3097
02:03:25,560 --> 02:03:26,100
Man.

3098
02:03:26,280 --> 02:03:27,460
Yeah this is fun.

3099
02:03:27,860 --> 02:03:29,900
I missed the first AJM slam.

3100
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:31,920
You like that shit?

3101
02:03:32,980 --> 02:03:34,920
It's stressful but it's fun man.

3102
02:03:36,580 --> 02:03:37,860
We just like...

3103
02:03:37,860 --> 02:03:40,120
We gotta wait for the next stage now.

3104
02:03:41,700 --> 02:03:42,740
Back to quick play.

3105
02:03:45,220 --> 02:03:47,160
Yeah actually let me pop in a ring.

3106
02:03:47,360 --> 02:03:48,180
Yeah actually let me pop in a ring.

3107
02:03:48,360 --> 02:03:49,660
Cause we got a while.

3108
02:03:51,700 --> 02:03:52,240
Alright.

3109
02:03:52,340 --> 02:03:52,460
Alright guys.

3110
02:03:52,820 --> 02:03:54,020
It's back to quick play.

3111
02:03:55,960 --> 02:03:57,460
Maybe this time.

3112
02:03:57,660 --> 02:03:58,940
Guys I swear.

3113
02:03:59,040 --> 02:04:02,220
I will land one combo.

3114
02:04:02,900 --> 02:04:03,500
Today.

3115
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:04,600
Hahaha.

3116
02:04:06,460 --> 02:04:08,280
That's not on the bot.

3117
02:04:08,580 --> 02:04:09,980
I swear to god.

3118
02:04:10,200 --> 02:04:10,360
No.

3119
02:04:10,540 --> 02:04:11,860
Oh wait I got the map I wanted.

3120
02:04:14,100 --> 02:04:16,160
I learned so much.

3121
02:04:16,900 --> 02:04:18,140
What do you mean?

3122
02:04:18,760 --> 02:04:19,360
Look.

3123
02:04:19,360 --> 02:04:20,160
Okay watch this.

3124
02:04:20,480 --> 02:04:20,960
Okay.

3125
02:04:21,360 --> 02:04:21,840
Boom.

3126
02:04:24,340 --> 02:04:26,800
Now let's see if I can do that on a real person.

3127
02:04:27,440 --> 02:04:27,920
Hahaha.

3128
02:04:27,960 --> 02:04:29,380
Yo are we right into it?

3129
02:04:30,780 --> 02:04:31,380
We're waiting.

3130
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:33,200
I think we're still waiting.

3131
02:04:34,240 --> 02:04:34,720
Look.

3132
02:04:35,020 --> 02:04:38,100
I'll be able to do that on a real person soon.

3133
02:04:39,060 --> 02:04:39,540
Hahaha.

3134
02:04:40,400 --> 02:04:42,300
I gotta fight my roommate Josh.

3135
02:04:42,740 --> 02:04:44,320
Are you guys gonna offline it or no?

3136
02:04:45,080 --> 02:04:46,240
No we should play online.

3137
02:04:46,240 --> 02:04:47,300
Cause we can both get left.

3138
02:04:47,920 --> 02:04:48,540
And uh.

3139
02:04:48,720 --> 02:04:51,700
It's probably less complicated to like.

3140
02:04:52,280 --> 02:04:52,960
Perspectate.

3141
02:04:55,020 --> 02:04:56,980
Wait who the fuck rank is this person?

3142
02:04:58,740 --> 02:04:59,960
Round 1.

3143
02:05:00,780 --> 02:05:01,460
Fight.

3144
02:05:01,460 --> 02:05:02,300
Oh 12.

3145
02:05:02,520 --> 02:05:02,900
Woah.

3146
02:05:03,300 --> 02:05:04,380
Sorry bro.

3147
02:05:10,660 --> 02:05:11,920
Oh god please.

3148
02:05:11,920 --> 02:05:12,600
Please.

3149
02:05:15,080 --> 02:05:16,040
Oh god.

3150
02:05:16,240 --> 02:05:16,840
Please.

3151
02:05:17,180 --> 02:05:18,700
I don't know your moves.

3152
02:05:20,200 --> 02:05:20,360
Hahaha.

3153
02:05:23,280 --> 02:05:24,240
Wait do I get that?

3154
02:05:24,440 --> 02:05:25,060
Oh I do.

3155
02:05:25,140 --> 02:05:25,580
I get that.

3156
02:05:25,920 --> 02:05:26,360
Nooo.

3157
02:05:27,460 --> 02:05:27,900
Goodbye.

3158
02:05:29,020 --> 02:05:29,460
Hahaha.

3159
02:05:34,720 --> 02:05:35,640
Is that your?

3160
02:05:35,840 --> 02:05:36,300
Who's your?

3161
02:05:40,440 --> 02:05:41,420
How many more rounds?

3162
02:05:41,600 --> 02:05:42,260
I think we have.

3163
02:05:42,460 --> 02:05:43,260
I think we're fighting.

3164
02:05:44,180 --> 02:05:45,340
Fighting every team.

3165
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:46,820
And there's 6 teams in total.

3166
02:05:47,360 --> 02:05:48,220
So uh.

3167
02:05:48,980 --> 02:05:49,560
Watch this.

3168
02:05:51,680 --> 02:05:52,120
Hahaha.

3169
02:05:53,100 --> 02:05:55,320
This is literally my favorite move.

3170
02:05:55,720 --> 02:05:56,040
Hahaha.

3171
02:05:56,240 --> 02:05:56,500
Hahaha.

3172
02:05:59,440 --> 02:06:00,280
Oh god.

3173
02:06:00,400 --> 02:06:00,840
Oh god.

3174
02:06:00,920 --> 02:06:01,200
Please.

3175
02:06:01,280 --> 02:06:01,680
I'm sorry.

3176
02:06:02,040 --> 02:06:02,960
I'm so sorry.

3177
02:06:02,980 --> 02:06:03,800
I'll never do that again.

3178
02:06:03,960 --> 02:06:04,740
I'm so sorry.

3179
02:06:05,400 --> 02:06:06,580
I'm so sorry.

3180
02:06:08,240 --> 02:06:08,720
JK.

3181
02:06:08,780 --> 02:06:09,540
I'm not sorry.

3182
02:06:09,780 --> 02:06:10,420
Do not duck!

3183
02:06:11,660 --> 02:06:12,360
Watch this.

3184
02:06:13,980 --> 02:06:14,460
Hahaha.

3185
02:06:15,300 --> 02:06:15,780
Hahaha.

3186
02:06:20,280 --> 02:06:23,540
That's literally the only thing I know how to do.

3187
02:06:23,740 --> 02:06:24,220
Hahaha.

3188
02:06:24,220 --> 02:06:25,140
JK.

3189
02:06:25,340 --> 02:06:26,400
I also know.

3190
02:06:26,460 --> 02:06:26,760
Oh wait.

3191
02:06:26,860 --> 02:06:28,020
I know how to do this.

3192
02:06:28,280 --> 02:06:29,080
But do you think she learned?

3193
02:06:29,400 --> 02:06:29,920
No.

3194
02:06:30,260 --> 02:06:31,300
They never learn.

3195
02:06:31,620 --> 02:06:33,020
That's why I like doing it.

3196
02:06:34,380 --> 02:06:35,620
Because they don't learn.

3197
02:06:38,140 --> 02:06:38,860
There you go.

3198
02:06:42,180 --> 02:06:43,500
They never learn.

3199
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:44,400
Hahaha.

3200
02:06:49,790 --> 02:06:50,310
Nope.

3201
02:06:50,570 --> 02:06:51,070
Okay.

3202
02:06:51,110 --> 02:06:51,990
I messed that up though.

3203
02:06:55,590 --> 02:06:56,630
They never expect it.

3204
02:06:56,710 --> 02:06:57,230
Why don't they?

3205
02:06:57,290 --> 02:06:58,050
I don't understand.

3206
02:06:58,310 --> 02:06:59,470
They should expect it.

3207
02:07:00,670 --> 02:07:01,190
Like.

3208
02:07:01,270 --> 02:07:02,610
It's such a good move.

3209
02:07:05,550 --> 02:07:06,070
Oh.

3210
02:07:06,090 --> 02:07:06,410
Alright.

3211
02:07:06,670 --> 02:07:06,990
Bye.

3212
02:07:08,090 --> 02:07:08,610
Bye.

3213
02:07:09,170 --> 02:07:09,690
Hahaha.

3214
02:07:11,750 --> 02:07:12,270
See.

3215
02:07:12,430 --> 02:07:13,190
They never learn.

3216
02:07:16,810 --> 02:07:17,550
Oh wait.

3217
02:07:17,590 --> 02:07:18,450
She did the thing to me.

3218
02:07:22,820 --> 02:07:23,340
Yay!

3219
02:07:24,380 --> 02:07:26,080
I beat a vanquisher.

3220
02:07:27,520 --> 02:07:28,160
Yippee!

3221
02:07:30,480 --> 02:07:33,180
I don't get anything because it was quick play.

3222
02:07:35,040 --> 02:07:35,680
Hahaha.

3223
02:07:36,900 --> 02:07:37,540
Yippee!

3224
02:07:39,920 --> 02:07:42,980
This is a winning I like to see.

3225
02:07:43,740 --> 02:07:44,380
Goodbye.

3226
02:07:44,460 --> 02:07:45,620
I'm a one and done person.

3227
02:07:46,640 --> 02:07:47,280
Hahaha.

3228
02:07:48,280 --> 02:07:48,660
Hahaha.

3229
02:07:52,840 --> 02:07:54,360
I'm pressing buttons.

3230
02:07:55,320 --> 02:07:56,060
One button.

3231
02:07:56,080 --> 02:07:58,100
One day I'll be able to do this in game.

3232
02:07:58,640 --> 02:07:59,600
One day!

3233
02:08:00,660 --> 02:08:00,780
Hehe.

3234
02:08:01,680 --> 02:08:02,400
Don't worry.

3235
02:08:02,620 --> 02:08:04,740
By the time the second round hit.

3236
02:08:04,860 --> 02:08:06,160
Round robin two hits.

3237
02:08:06,280 --> 02:08:07,560
I'll be able to do that in game.

3238
02:08:08,460 --> 02:08:09,920
One and done.

3239
02:08:10,420 --> 02:08:10,880
Hahaha.

3240
02:08:12,340 --> 02:08:12,860
Hahaha.

3241
02:08:16,260 --> 02:08:17,840
This evil monkey.

3242
02:08:20,300 --> 02:08:22,100
She will live without defeat forever.

3243
02:08:22,320 --> 02:08:26,060
I bet you that person has been practicing Tekken for like fucking weeks and I rolled up the screen.

3244
02:08:26,080 --> 02:08:27,120
I ruined her day.

3245
02:08:28,100 --> 02:08:34,600
I hope this person knows I'm streaming and finds out I've only been playing Tekken for like for like three days.

3246
02:08:37,340 --> 02:08:38,320
That's all I want.

3247
02:08:40,100 --> 02:08:41,100
Can she dodge this?

3248
02:08:41,340 --> 02:08:41,480
No.

3249
02:08:41,620 --> 02:08:41,760
Oh!

3250
02:08:41,820 --> 02:08:42,320
She can!

3251
02:08:42,620 --> 02:08:43,800
But can she dodge this?

3252
02:08:44,300 --> 02:08:44,780
Oh!

3253
02:08:45,720 --> 02:08:46,200
Hahaha.

3254
02:08:48,440 --> 02:08:48,920
Hahaha.

3255
02:08:50,100 --> 02:08:51,960
Okay I should stop fucking around.

3256
02:08:52,560 --> 02:08:53,040
Hahaha.

3257
02:08:53,960 --> 02:08:55,000
Please let me up.

3258
02:08:55,020 --> 02:08:55,460
I'm sorry.

3259
02:08:57,280 --> 02:08:58,400
I'm so sorry.

3260
02:08:58,520 --> 02:08:59,200
I was fucking her.

3261
02:08:59,260 --> 02:09:00,060
I'm so sorry.

3262
02:09:00,500 --> 02:09:01,020
Hahaha.

3263
02:09:02,360 --> 02:09:02,880
Hahaha.

3264
02:09:03,500 --> 02:09:06,140
They never expected twice.

3265
02:09:07,020 --> 02:09:07,540
Okay.

3266
02:09:07,760 --> 02:09:08,900
But does she expect again?

3267
02:09:09,180 --> 02:09:10,040
Oh wait she did.

3268
02:09:10,840 --> 02:09:12,740
Okay but do you think she'll expect it again?

3269
02:09:12,840 --> 02:09:14,240
Oh she just swings yes.

3270
02:09:14,600 --> 02:09:16,240
Okay I should stop trolling now.

3271
02:09:16,420 --> 02:09:17,160
For real.

3272
02:09:17,980 --> 02:09:19,420
Okay for real this time.

3273
02:09:19,560 --> 02:09:20,240
For real.

3274
02:09:20,880 --> 02:09:21,400
Hahaha.

3275
02:09:21,400 --> 02:09:22,080
Hahaha.

3276
02:09:23,720 --> 02:09:25,420
Do not move Doki.

3277
02:09:26,340 --> 02:09:26,820
Oh.

3278
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:28,400
Oh man.

3279
02:09:28,620 --> 02:09:34,140
I wanna do this move that my coach keeps telling me to do but I can never pull it off in a real fucking game.

3280
02:09:34,440 --> 02:09:35,820
Cause it's so difficult.

3281
02:09:38,280 --> 02:09:38,760
Please.

3282
02:09:38,840 --> 02:09:39,240
I'm trying.

3283
02:09:39,360 --> 02:09:39,620
Please.

3284
02:09:39,640 --> 02:09:43,000
I really wanna do that move that my coach wanted me to do.

3285
02:09:43,760 --> 02:09:44,240
Hahaha.

3286
02:09:48,360 --> 02:09:48,840
Please.

3287
02:09:49,560 --> 02:09:50,640
I can block.

3288
02:09:51,340 --> 02:09:53,260
It's just that like I get impatient.

3289
02:09:55,600 --> 02:09:56,080
Alright.

3290
02:09:56,200 --> 02:09:56,940
Watch me block.

3291
02:09:57,160 --> 02:09:58,420
Okay you guys think I can't block?

3292
02:09:58,540 --> 02:09:59,060
Watch this.

3293
02:09:59,220 --> 02:10:01,280
Wait this person has 13 wins in a row.

3294
02:10:01,480 --> 02:10:03,960
This guy is actually a fucking bullying noob.

3295
02:10:04,380 --> 02:10:04,860
See!

3296
02:10:05,040 --> 02:10:05,860
Look at that!

3297
02:10:06,300 --> 02:10:07,520
I told you.

3298
02:10:08,300 --> 02:10:10,300
I told you I knew how to block.

3299
02:10:11,480 --> 02:10:13,640
Nobody believes me ever.

3300
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:15,480
Hahaha.

3301
02:10:16,780 --> 02:10:17,260
Hahaha.

3302
02:10:18,440 --> 02:10:19,160
Watch this.

3303
02:10:21,520 --> 02:10:22,060
See!

3304
02:10:22,240 --> 02:10:24,040
I told you I can block moves.

3305
02:10:24,340 --> 02:10:24,720
Oh.

3306
02:10:27,980 --> 02:10:29,020
Do I hit these?

3307
02:10:29,560 --> 02:10:30,380
Yeah I do.

3308
02:10:31,020 --> 02:10:32,240
I told you!

3309
02:10:35,500 --> 02:10:37,100
Do not in the actual.

3310
02:10:37,220 --> 02:10:38,740
Look this is not the tournament.

3311
02:10:38,960 --> 02:10:40,620
This is just a round robin.

3312
02:10:41,040 --> 02:10:41,180
Hahaha.

3313
02:10:43,040 --> 02:10:46,220
This is just a round robin.

3314
02:10:46,600 --> 02:10:47,540
There's love bow.

3315
02:10:48,520 --> 02:10:49,300
There's jump.

3316
02:10:50,800 --> 02:10:51,320
Yo.

3317
02:10:51,320 --> 02:10:51,660
Yo.

3318
02:10:51,720 --> 02:10:51,840
Yo.

3319
02:10:52,680 --> 02:10:53,560
Lobby is up.

3320
02:10:54,700 --> 02:10:55,220
Okay.

3321
02:10:55,960 --> 02:10:57,400
I'm gonna lose real fast.

3322
02:10:58,580 --> 02:10:59,820
Yeah me too.

3323
02:10:59,920 --> 02:11:00,720
I'll be in in one second.

3324
02:11:00,840 --> 02:11:01,340
Oh my god.

3325
02:11:01,440 --> 02:11:01,880
Me too.

3326
02:11:02,140 --> 02:11:03,560
But I can't unmute myself.

3327
02:11:04,500 --> 02:11:05,020
Ah!

3328
02:11:08,560 --> 02:11:09,800
Look chat last.

3329
02:11:10,180 --> 02:11:10,740
It's okay.

3330
02:11:10,860 --> 02:11:12,080
I'm purposely losing.

3331
02:11:12,540 --> 02:11:13,360
I muted the wrong thing.

3332
02:11:13,640 --> 02:11:15,900
I'm purposely losing.

3333
02:11:15,900 --> 02:11:16,640
I'm sad now.

3334
02:11:18,360 --> 02:11:18,820
Guys.

3335
02:11:18,920 --> 02:11:20,620
I'm purposely losing guys.

3336
02:11:21,700 --> 02:11:23,020
Guys you don't understand.

3337
02:11:23,660 --> 02:11:24,000
Guys you don't understand.

3338
02:11:24,600 --> 02:11:26,240
He just ducks and launches me?

3339
02:11:26,320 --> 02:11:26,900
No way.

3340
02:11:27,340 --> 02:11:28,540
Can I keep doing this?

3341
02:11:28,580 --> 02:11:28,680
That sucks.

3342
02:11:28,820 --> 02:11:30,640
And I'm gonna leave and he's gonna be furious.

3343
02:11:31,520 --> 02:11:32,720
I feel really bad.

3344
02:11:33,420 --> 02:11:33,880
Okay.

3345
02:11:33,880 --> 02:11:36,820
This guy's good and I'm just one and done-ing him after I win.

3346
02:11:37,720 --> 02:11:38,180
Okay.

3347
02:11:38,580 --> 02:11:39,860
He did promo off me.

3348
02:11:40,820 --> 02:11:41,280
Okay.

3349
02:11:42,500 --> 02:11:43,860
Please I need to lose.

3350
02:11:43,860 --> 02:11:44,940
Dude I'm sorry.

3351
02:11:44,940 --> 02:11:45,260
Thank god.

3352
02:11:45,420 --> 02:11:45,620
Okay.

3353
02:11:48,520 --> 02:11:51,760
I fought a drag who was very good and cleaned me up first round.

3354
02:11:52,180 --> 02:11:54,120
And then I beat him second game and I left.

3355
02:11:54,240 --> 02:11:55,520
Because we had to get in his lobby.

3356
02:11:56,260 --> 02:11:57,300
Oh I feel bad.

3357
02:11:57,560 --> 02:11:57,900
Okay.

3358
02:11:58,140 --> 02:11:58,520
Alright.

3359
02:11:58,620 --> 02:11:59,020
Thank god.

3360
02:11:59,100 --> 02:11:59,420
Okay.

3361
02:12:00,040 --> 02:12:01,960
If that guy comes in here I'm gonna apologize.

3362
02:12:04,360 --> 02:12:04,740
Alright.

3363
02:12:05,180 --> 02:12:06,160
Now to join.

3364
02:12:06,280 --> 02:12:07,160
Where the fuck is it?

3365
02:12:07,280 --> 02:12:07,800
Oh there you go.

3366
02:12:08,560 --> 02:12:09,260
Oh my god.

3367
02:12:09,320 --> 02:12:09,860
Which guy?

3368
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:10,380
Which guy?

3369
02:12:10,460 --> 02:12:11,100
He is Sam!

3370
02:12:11,100 --> 02:12:11,560
Oh fuck.

3371
02:12:11,660 --> 02:12:12,000
Okay.

3372
02:12:13,860 --> 02:12:15,240
He slapped me first round.

3373
02:12:15,380 --> 02:12:17,220
And second round I beat him and I had to leave.

3374
02:12:18,240 --> 02:12:20,980
So I just got my win and then left.

3375
02:12:21,400 --> 02:12:22,540
So he thinks you ran.

3376
02:12:23,120 --> 02:12:23,560
He thinks you ran.

3377
02:12:23,560 --> 02:12:23,560
Yeah.

3378
02:12:23,680 --> 02:12:24,340
He thinks I'm bad.

3379
02:12:24,420 --> 02:12:25,220
I feel bad bro.

3380
02:12:25,280 --> 02:12:25,640
My bad.

3381
02:12:25,920 --> 02:12:27,280
Oh there's a passcode.

3382
02:12:27,340 --> 02:12:27,880
Excellent leak?

3383
02:12:28,060 --> 02:12:28,400
Listen.

3384
02:12:29,080 --> 02:12:30,260
Nobody's coming in here right?

3385
02:12:30,380 --> 02:12:31,000
We're good.

3386
02:12:32,640 --> 02:12:35,760
If that guy comes in here his name was Legday Germ I think.

3387
02:12:35,940 --> 02:12:37,300
Hey if you're watching.

3388
02:12:39,040 --> 02:12:39,920
Legday Germ.

3389
02:12:40,160 --> 02:12:40,600
Hahaha.

3390
02:12:40,600 --> 02:12:40,840
Hahaha.

3391
02:12:43,160 --> 02:12:45,900
Maybe his Twitch won't be the same as his...

3392
02:12:46,740 --> 02:12:47,600
Steam name.

3393
02:12:50,260 --> 02:12:50,960
Oh god.

3394
02:12:51,260 --> 02:12:53,100
Dough King versus...

3395
02:12:53,100 --> 02:12:53,720
Oh god.

3396
02:12:53,940 --> 02:12:54,380
Hahaha.

3397
02:12:54,820 --> 02:12:55,660
I believe.

3398
02:12:56,600 --> 02:12:58,140
I'm going in there with confidence.

3399
02:12:58,900 --> 02:13:00,880
And you saw Kony's match and my match.

3400
02:13:00,980 --> 02:13:02,320
Yeah I absorbed that.

3401
02:13:02,380 --> 02:13:03,580
I absorbed all of that.

3402
02:13:03,780 --> 02:13:05,200
Just do the same shit.

3403
02:13:05,300 --> 02:13:05,720
Exactly.

3404
02:13:07,060 --> 02:13:09,280
Maybe you guys should change your name to Dough King as well.

3405
02:13:09,440 --> 02:13:09,860
Hahaha.

3406
02:13:11,760 --> 02:13:12,860
Free publicity.

3407
02:13:13,120 --> 02:13:14,060
Okay I see.

3408
02:13:18,880 --> 02:13:20,340
Alright here we go.

3409
02:13:23,560 --> 02:13:24,760
Mission survive.

3410
02:13:27,900 --> 02:13:28,920
What the fuck?

3411
02:13:29,280 --> 02:13:29,700
King.

3412
02:13:30,780 --> 02:13:31,400
No.

3413
02:13:31,720 --> 02:13:32,160
Why?

3414
02:13:32,360 --> 02:13:34,840
No I forgot to put my costume on.

3415
02:13:34,960 --> 02:13:35,400
Oh it's okay.

3416
02:13:36,440 --> 02:13:37,060
Hahaha.

3417
02:13:38,860 --> 02:13:41,900
That's probably a big deal for like YouTubers right now.

3418
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:42,500
No.

3419
02:13:42,640 --> 02:13:43,320
I'm wearing my costume.

3420
02:13:43,920 --> 02:13:45,520
And I'm default Dan.

3421
02:13:48,860 --> 02:13:49,820
Default Dan?

3422
02:13:49,960 --> 02:13:50,200
Okay.

3423
02:13:50,320 --> 02:13:50,900
Restart.

3424
02:13:50,920 --> 02:13:51,460
Restart.

3425
02:13:51,720 --> 02:13:52,080
Alright.

3426
02:13:56,160 --> 02:13:57,920
Freaking ESAM and SK.

3427
02:13:58,160 --> 02:13:59,500
The ES people man.

3428
02:13:59,660 --> 02:14:01,300
With so many hours on the game.

3429
02:14:02,180 --> 02:14:02,780
ES.

3430
02:14:03,220 --> 02:14:03,820
Spanish.

3431
02:14:04,620 --> 02:14:05,500
Spanish folks.

3432
02:14:05,560 --> 02:14:05,860
Oh god.

3433
02:14:09,420 --> 02:14:10,780
Please let me get up.

3434
02:14:10,780 --> 02:14:12,180
I hate martial arts.

3435
02:14:12,180 --> 02:14:12,540
Please.

3436
02:14:12,540 --> 02:14:14,000
I'm sorry I hit you.

3437
02:14:14,080 --> 02:14:15,000
Just let me get up.

3438
02:14:15,420 --> 02:14:15,520
Hahaha.

3439
02:14:17,100 --> 02:14:18,300
Cook this man.

3440
02:14:18,500 --> 02:14:19,460
RKO his ass.

3441
02:14:19,640 --> 02:14:21,360
Martial law hates rich people.

3442
02:14:22,480 --> 02:14:24,380
King is not rich man.

3443
02:14:26,220 --> 02:14:27,080
Oh god.

3444
02:14:27,320 --> 02:14:27,720
He's pro wrestler.

3445
02:14:28,960 --> 02:14:30,380
Can I get up in time?

3446
02:14:30,480 --> 02:14:30,680
No.

3447
02:14:30,720 --> 02:14:31,120
Hahaha.

3448
02:14:33,500 --> 02:14:34,520
This kill is on.

3449
02:14:35,880 --> 02:14:36,440
No.

3450
02:14:38,140 --> 02:14:38,420
Wow.

3451
02:14:39,040 --> 02:14:39,860
Wait I'm alive.

3452
02:14:40,460 --> 02:14:41,020
Okay.

3453
02:14:42,140 --> 02:14:42,700
Hahaha.

3454
02:14:44,160 --> 02:14:44,720
Hahaha.

3455
02:14:46,300 --> 02:14:49,000
It was nice being alive for a second.

3456
02:14:50,860 --> 02:14:51,420
Hahaha.

3457
02:14:51,920 --> 02:14:52,020
Hahaha.

3458
02:14:53,060 --> 02:14:53,620
Wait.

3459
02:14:53,780 --> 02:14:54,300
I'm lost.

3460
02:14:54,520 --> 02:14:55,300
Are we stage 2?

3461
02:14:56,400 --> 02:14:57,080
Wait what?

3462
02:14:57,360 --> 02:14:58,120
Yeah we are.

3463
02:14:58,120 --> 02:14:59,440
We started the game.

3464
02:15:00,660 --> 02:15:02,000
Yeah Ducky is in her match.

3465
02:15:02,120 --> 02:15:04,180
Yeah I'm in my match right now.

3466
02:15:04,200 --> 02:15:05,820
And martial law is unfortunately cooking.

3467
02:15:07,800 --> 02:15:08,960
Oh my god.

3468
02:15:09,040 --> 02:15:09,840
Yeah he is definitely cooking.

3469
02:15:10,520 --> 02:15:11,000
Okay.

3470
02:15:13,040 --> 02:15:15,080
He's like 3 ranks above me.

3471
02:15:16,360 --> 02:15:18,440
Uh I think it's more than 3.

3472
02:15:18,500 --> 02:15:18,980
Hahaha.

3473
02:15:19,840 --> 02:15:20,320
Hahaha.

3474
02:15:22,820 --> 02:15:24,260
It's okay I can catch up.

3475
02:15:25,160 --> 02:15:25,640
Oh.

3476
02:15:26,060 --> 02:15:26,740
That's right.

3477
02:15:26,900 --> 02:15:28,380
I told you I can catch up.

3478
02:15:28,620 --> 02:15:29,020
Hahaha.

3479
02:15:31,160 --> 02:15:33,560
I can get to red rank in less hours.

3480
02:15:34,820 --> 02:15:35,620
I believe.

3481
02:15:36,640 --> 02:15:37,680
Actually we'll do that.

3482
02:15:37,920 --> 02:15:38,320
You know what?

3483
02:15:38,320 --> 02:15:38,920
Yeah you know what?

3484
02:15:39,320 --> 02:15:39,840
I'm alive.

3485
02:15:39,860 --> 02:15:40,420
I'm gonna do it.

3486
02:15:42,580 --> 02:15:45,100
I'm giving them a false sense of security in round robin 1.

3487
02:15:45,380 --> 02:15:48,360
And I'm gonna roll up in red rank in round robin 2.

3488
02:15:48,600 --> 02:15:48,620
And I'm gonna roll up in red rank in round robin 2.

3489
02:15:48,620 --> 02:15:48,700
And I'm gonna roll up in red rank in round robin 2.

3490
02:15:49,800 --> 02:15:50,580
Wait I'm alive.

3491
02:15:51,320 --> 02:15:52,180
He's gonna slide again.

3492
02:15:52,300 --> 02:15:52,540
Hahaha.

3493
02:15:54,380 --> 02:15:56,740
We gotta download from the first round.

3494
02:15:56,980 --> 02:15:59,220
Ducky we gotta download from the first round.

3495
02:15:59,480 --> 02:16:01,460
Like Slime is doing.

3496
02:16:01,560 --> 02:16:02,320
We gotta do that.

3497
02:16:02,840 --> 02:16:03,020
Hahaha.

3498
02:16:05,540 --> 02:16:05,960
That's it.

3499
02:16:05,960 --> 02:16:07,480
In the second set.

3500
02:16:07,700 --> 02:16:08,920
I'll remember that.

3501
02:16:09,580 --> 02:16:11,220
It's cause I'm not in my costume.

3502
02:16:12,040 --> 02:16:13,100
I'm getting distracted.

3503
02:16:13,580 --> 02:16:13,860
Yeah it's costume debuff.

3504
02:16:14,100 --> 02:16:17,020
I mean it's a real thing.

3505
02:16:18,040 --> 02:16:19,700
His boots are so shiny.

3506
02:16:19,860 --> 02:16:20,340
I just noticed.

3507
02:16:22,500 --> 02:16:23,400
Oh my god.

3508
02:16:30,890 --> 02:16:32,320
This nerd Ethan.

3509
02:16:33,040 --> 02:16:33,620
Hahahaha.

3510
02:16:33,840 --> 02:16:35,200
8000 hours.

3511
02:16:36,520 --> 02:16:38,080
Some of us have lives.

3512
02:16:38,700 --> 02:16:39,220
Yeah.

3513
02:16:39,340 --> 02:16:41,840
Some of us have other stuff to do.

3514
02:16:42,700 --> 02:16:43,720
But it's okay.

3515
02:16:43,840 --> 02:16:45,080
I've delayed that.

3516
02:16:45,420 --> 02:16:48,540
I guess if this video game is like so important for you.

3517
02:16:48,620 --> 02:16:49,220
That's fine.

3518
02:16:49,440 --> 02:16:49,960
Yeah.

3519
02:16:52,180 --> 02:16:54,560
Wow you must really wanna go to Evo.

3520
02:16:54,640 --> 02:16:55,020
Wow.

3521
02:16:55,880 --> 02:16:57,880
I can pay for my own ticket.

3522
02:16:58,420 --> 02:16:58,940
Hahaha.

3523
02:17:03,520 --> 02:17:05,500
Yeah all of us already won a trip.

3524
02:17:06,220 --> 02:17:07,760
Ducky is a multi billionaire.

3525
02:17:09,810 --> 02:17:10,520
Fuck yes.

3526
02:17:10,620 --> 02:17:13,540
I don't know what I'm doing anymore.

3527
02:17:13,760 --> 02:17:14,160
Hahaha.

3528
02:17:15,770 --> 02:17:17,400
No don't make me laugh.

3529
02:17:17,840 --> 02:17:18,520
Hahaha.

3530
02:17:18,960 --> 02:17:20,980
Oh my god.

3531
02:17:25,240 --> 02:17:26,100
Shmeesh man.

3532
02:17:27,080 --> 02:17:28,160
Oh my god.

3533
02:17:28,180 --> 02:17:28,340
Please.

3534
02:17:29,140 --> 02:17:30,880
Please my coach made me laugh.

3535
02:17:31,340 --> 02:17:32,040
Hahaha.

3536
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:35,340
Did that bounce?

3537
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:36,740
Let's go.

3538
02:17:38,080 --> 02:17:39,020
Nobody is laughing over there.

3539
02:17:39,120 --> 02:17:39,560
Hahaha.

3540
02:17:40,240 --> 02:17:41,760
We're not having any fun.

3541
02:17:41,840 --> 02:17:43,320
Let's be real here.

3542
02:17:43,500 --> 02:17:44,540
What are the real stakes?

3543
02:17:44,680 --> 02:17:45,540
We got a trip to Evo.

3544
02:17:46,820 --> 02:17:48,720
Ducky, billionaire, multi millionaire.

3545
02:17:49,040 --> 02:17:50,080
Yeah I'm having fun.

3546
02:17:50,340 --> 02:17:52,140
We got three content creators.

3547
02:17:52,320 --> 02:17:52,680
Exactly.

3548
02:17:54,440 --> 02:17:56,740
This is all about making content.

3549
02:17:56,980 --> 02:17:57,900
Oh that was clean though.

3550
02:17:57,920 --> 02:17:58,760
Oh shit I got it.

3551
02:17:59,420 --> 02:18:00,480
Content let's go.

3552
02:18:01,660 --> 02:18:04,320
The only person that probably couldn't afford it was BrawlPro.

3553
02:18:05,020 --> 02:18:05,580
Hahaha.

3554
02:18:05,580 --> 02:18:05,660
Yeah.

3555
02:18:07,160 --> 02:18:08,580
What the fuck.

3556
02:18:09,020 --> 02:18:10,040
Shut up.

3557
02:18:11,380 --> 02:18:11,940
Let's go.

3558
02:18:14,800 --> 02:18:16,160
I got a round.

3559
02:18:16,220 --> 02:18:17,560
I got a round off of red.

3560
02:18:20,040 --> 02:18:21,160
Oh shit.

3561
02:18:21,240 --> 02:18:21,940
That was my bad.

3562
02:18:24,960 --> 02:18:25,520
Ooosh.

3563
02:18:26,800 --> 02:18:27,360
Oops.

3564
02:18:28,020 --> 02:18:30,940
My hands always go onto the wrong position sometimes.

3565
02:18:31,580 --> 02:18:32,940
Nice call out.

3566
02:18:33,120 --> 02:18:33,680
Yes.

3567
02:18:34,440 --> 02:18:35,740
See I'm learning.

3568
02:18:36,040 --> 02:18:37,720
I had a feeling because he kept ducking.

3569
02:18:38,280 --> 02:18:39,860
He's a duck lord.

3570
02:18:40,060 --> 02:18:40,240
Yeah.

3571
02:18:40,500 --> 02:18:43,660
See I knew I could learn.

3572
02:18:44,580 --> 02:18:45,440
Break his arm.

3573
02:18:45,540 --> 02:18:46,080
Yeah.

3574
02:18:46,320 --> 02:18:47,480
Break his arm.

3575
02:18:47,480 --> 02:18:48,480
He can't afford insurance.

3576
02:18:49,920 --> 02:18:50,480
Hahaha.

3577
02:18:50,500 --> 02:18:51,640
That's true he is poor.

3578
02:18:52,340 --> 02:18:53,180
Wait a minute.

3579
02:18:53,180 --> 02:18:53,680
Mix up.

3580
02:18:53,680 --> 02:18:54,000
Mix up.

3581
02:18:54,160 --> 02:18:54,520
No.

3582
02:18:57,600 --> 02:18:58,280
Nice try.

3583
02:18:59,340 --> 02:19:01,600
To be honest Noki did you know the mix up there?

3584
02:19:01,740 --> 02:19:03,840
Did you know like what to do after the...

3585
02:19:03,840 --> 02:19:04,020
Yeah.

3586
02:19:04,040 --> 02:19:05,880
Because whenever I do that throw I don't know what to do.

3587
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:06,560
I'm like uh oh.

3588
02:19:07,020 --> 02:19:07,840
We're both guessing.

3589
02:19:09,260 --> 02:19:10,740
We're both hitting a button on the controller.

3590
02:19:11,580 --> 02:19:12,760
Something would work.

3591
02:19:13,460 --> 02:19:13,820
Hahaha.

3592
02:19:15,880 --> 02:19:16,560
There's a lot.

3593
02:19:16,580 --> 02:19:17,920
Whenever King does that.

3594
02:19:17,940 --> 02:19:18,140
You're like Clay?

3595
02:19:18,880 --> 02:19:19,480
It's crazy.

3596
02:19:20,060 --> 02:19:21,720
You'll be molded into a killer.

3597
02:19:23,180 --> 02:19:26,100
Look at what a couple of hours I can do.

3598
02:19:26,540 --> 02:19:28,900
Imagine what happens if I get like 40 more hours.

3599
02:19:29,540 --> 02:19:31,100
You will absolutely make it.

3600
02:19:31,320 --> 02:19:31,800
I can.

3601
02:19:31,840 --> 02:19:32,280
I believe.

3602
02:19:32,660 --> 02:19:34,360
With your belief I believe.

3603
02:19:34,940 --> 02:19:35,660
And hey.

3604
02:19:36,020 --> 02:19:37,240
You can just buy the ticket.

3605
02:19:37,540 --> 02:19:37,980
Hahaha.

3606
02:19:40,320 --> 02:19:41,840
You can buy your own fucking liberalist.

3607
02:19:41,840 --> 02:19:43,240
I want the mental warfare.

3608
02:19:44,100 --> 02:19:44,620
Hahaha.

3609
02:19:46,320 --> 02:19:48,600
Imagine losing a round to a yellow.

3610
02:19:48,880 --> 02:19:49,220
Hahaha.

3611
02:19:50,160 --> 02:19:50,680
Broooo.

3612
02:19:52,640 --> 02:19:53,160
Someone's coming.

3613
02:19:53,180 --> 02:19:55,080
He's stone faced right now.

3614
02:19:55,160 --> 02:19:56,720
So they weren't having a good time.

3615
02:19:57,200 --> 02:19:57,680
Really?

3616
02:19:59,500 --> 02:20:01,080
Josh is dead silent.

3617
02:20:01,160 --> 02:20:02,520
And all he cares about is vibes.

3618
02:20:02,820 --> 02:20:03,320
Here I go.

3619
02:20:03,320 --> 02:20:03,920
I'm locking in.

3620
02:20:04,560 --> 02:20:06,440
We're winning like the content wars.

3621
02:20:07,860 --> 02:20:10,420
That's what the real Brawl throne is all about.

3622
02:20:11,040 --> 02:20:11,820
That's where all the views are at.

3623
02:20:11,820 --> 02:20:13,100
We didn't even win last slam.

3624
02:20:13,180 --> 02:20:13,480
Did we?

3625
02:20:13,560 --> 02:20:13,700
No.

3626
02:20:16,480 --> 02:20:17,020
That's true.

3627
02:20:17,800 --> 02:20:19,080
That's what everybody talks about.

3628
02:20:19,080 --> 02:20:22,280
Yeah, we're coming in with more content.

3629
02:20:22,880 --> 02:20:23,980
It's the truth.

3630
02:20:25,100 --> 02:20:27,520
I need to get the fuck out of here, my bad.

3631
02:20:35,200 --> 02:20:36,700
Oh, you gotta swap out.

3632
02:20:36,800 --> 02:20:37,320
Oh shit!

3633
02:20:38,780 --> 02:20:40,300
Give me a sec.

3634
02:20:40,980 --> 02:20:42,400
Actually, I think it's gonna kick you out.

3635
02:20:42,580 --> 02:20:44,100
I thought they were gonna swap me.

3636
02:20:44,100 --> 02:20:46,280
They can swap me, like...

3637
02:20:46,940 --> 02:20:47,420
automatically.

3638
02:21:18,150 --> 02:21:18,790
Mm-hmm.

3639
02:21:20,950 --> 02:21:21,750
Round one.

3640
02:21:22,950 --> 02:21:23,910
Oh, Raidus.

3641
02:21:23,950 --> 02:21:24,350
Ni ha!

3642
02:21:27,290 --> 02:21:29,110
That third hit, you can duck it.

3643
02:21:29,170 --> 02:21:30,150
Yeah, I remember.

3644
02:21:31,330 --> 02:21:33,630
Just gotta get hop kicked after the second.

3645
02:21:36,090 --> 02:21:36,490
No!

3646
02:21:36,730 --> 02:21:37,750
I tried to back up.

3647
02:21:38,830 --> 02:21:39,970
Yeah, that's my fault.

3648
02:21:40,030 --> 02:21:43,010
I tried to back up and I tried to do a hop back and then I did that kick.

3649
02:21:48,410 --> 02:21:49,210
Round two.

3650
02:21:50,270 --> 02:21:50,670
Fight!

3651
02:21:53,610 --> 02:21:54,670
Dragunov Moisturize Challenge.

3652
02:21:55,510 --> 02:21:55,910
Impossible.

3653
02:21:59,530 --> 02:22:01,670
Okay, I'm about to say this guy doesn't know.

3654
02:22:02,470 --> 02:22:04,070
I think he knows, guys.

3655
02:22:05,770 --> 02:22:07,030
Don't break your win streak!

3656
02:22:09,150 --> 02:22:12,210
Funny, after you get hit with that down two, you can challenge it with while standing four.

3657
02:22:12,410 --> 02:22:13,650
He's a minus one after that.

3658
02:22:15,110 --> 02:22:17,370
The spinny low he's doing, just mash for it.

3659
02:22:18,150 --> 02:22:20,990
It's a mix-up, but I don't think he's gonna play that mix-up.

3660
02:22:24,070 --> 02:22:25,410
Oh my god, counter hit grabs.

3661
02:22:25,510 --> 02:22:26,450
He's mashing, bro.

3662
02:22:27,370 --> 02:22:28,630
Bro, he's just like me.

3663
02:22:31,310 --> 02:22:33,150
Dude, he's actually just mashing.

3664
02:22:33,770 --> 02:22:34,550
Wait, really?

3665
02:22:35,350 --> 02:22:35,810
Yeah.

3666
02:22:35,870 --> 02:22:36,950
Yeah, it's just buttons.

3667
02:22:38,750 --> 02:22:39,210
Oh!

3668
02:22:39,210 --> 02:22:39,670
Oh!

3669
02:22:40,610 --> 02:22:41,690
Wait, mash him back!

3670
02:22:43,130 --> 02:22:44,910
It's just fucking buttons, dude.

3671
02:22:46,030 --> 02:22:46,490
Okay.

3672
02:22:46,630 --> 02:22:47,870
All right, he loves the low.

3673
02:22:48,150 --> 02:22:49,390
Off of a... off of a go.

3674
02:22:49,590 --> 02:22:51,470
Yeah, that's that down two that killed you.

3675
02:22:51,770 --> 02:22:52,870
Round four.

3676
02:22:53,110 --> 02:22:53,470
Dude.

3677
02:22:53,870 --> 02:22:54,310
Fight!

3678
02:22:57,390 --> 02:22:58,230
Oh my god.

3679
02:22:58,570 --> 02:22:59,010
Oh.

3680
02:22:59,130 --> 02:23:00,030
He's just like me.

3681
02:23:00,150 --> 02:23:00,830
He's just so mashing, man.

3682
02:23:10,980 --> 02:23:11,900
Oh my god.

3683
02:23:12,080 --> 02:23:13,120
Tried to create space.

3684
02:23:14,020 --> 02:23:14,460
Whoa!

3685
02:23:14,600 --> 02:23:15,620
Just look at the damage here.

3686
02:23:15,840 --> 02:23:16,280
Oh!

3687
02:23:16,420 --> 02:23:16,860
Oh!

3688
02:23:17,180 --> 02:23:17,620
God!

3689
02:23:18,360 --> 02:23:19,620
I thought he was against the wall.

3690
02:23:22,480 --> 02:23:23,540
Bring his arm!

3691
02:23:24,160 --> 02:23:24,700
Got it.

3692
02:23:24,700 --> 02:23:25,440
There's no way.

3693
02:23:26,720 --> 02:23:27,360
Let's go, baby.

3694
02:23:27,720 --> 02:23:28,360
Nice job.

3695
02:23:28,480 --> 02:23:29,300
He broke it earlier.

3696
02:23:29,580 --> 02:23:29,980
Let's go, Ray!

3697
02:23:30,260 --> 02:23:31,320
I mean, sorry, Coney.

3698
02:23:34,060 --> 02:23:35,120
I got brain rot, sorry.

3699
02:23:36,760 --> 02:23:37,800
I got brain rot.

3700
02:23:37,860 --> 02:23:38,280
Like, for real.

3701
02:23:38,340 --> 02:23:38,780
I got brain rot.

3702
02:23:38,900 --> 02:23:39,480
No disrespect.

3703
02:23:39,680 --> 02:23:40,000
So sorry.

3704
02:23:40,600 --> 02:23:41,460
That wasn't content?

3705
02:23:41,720 --> 02:23:42,620
That was on purpose?

3706
02:23:43,080 --> 02:23:44,440
It was for content reasons?

3707
02:23:46,860 --> 02:23:47,580
Uh-oh.

3708
02:23:47,840 --> 02:23:48,920
It's looking like a Rapskies.

3709
02:23:49,260 --> 02:23:50,060
Oh my god!

3710
02:23:50,500 --> 02:23:51,300
Oh my god, Ray!

3711
02:23:51,380 --> 02:23:51,600
No!

3712
02:23:53,380 --> 02:23:53,840
Got it.

3713
02:23:54,620 --> 02:23:55,200
All right.

3714
02:23:55,200 --> 02:23:55,580
I got it.

3715
02:23:55,580 --> 02:23:56,540
Let's go, Coney!

3716
02:23:57,080 --> 02:23:57,680
I got it.

3717
02:23:57,740 --> 02:23:58,180
I got it.

3718
02:23:58,180 --> 02:23:58,400
I got it.

3719
02:23:58,500 --> 02:23:58,660
I got it.

3720
02:23:58,660 --> 02:23:58,700
Let's go!

3721
02:23:58,700 --> 02:23:58,880
Perfect!

3722
02:24:01,240 --> 02:24:01,880
You win!

3723
02:24:01,900 --> 02:24:02,740
Ray was like...

3724
02:24:03,180 --> 02:24:04,900
He gets run over in the alley kicks.

3725
02:24:05,860 --> 02:24:06,420
Yeah, dude.

3726
02:24:06,500 --> 02:24:07,080
I was sending it.

3727
02:24:07,120 --> 02:24:07,440
Fuck it.

3728
02:24:08,580 --> 02:24:09,900
If he can't mash, he doesn't win.

3729
02:24:13,770 --> 02:24:14,090
Fight!

3730
02:24:14,870 --> 02:24:16,210
That's the wall sending for ya.

3731
02:24:16,770 --> 02:24:17,310
Yes, sir.

3732
02:24:17,410 --> 02:24:18,290
Yeah, I feel ya.

3733
02:24:18,430 --> 02:24:19,370
He always goes low.

3734
02:24:19,510 --> 02:24:19,990
I'm gonna grab on that too, yeah.

3735
02:24:21,050 --> 02:24:22,890
That's not gonna work on day two, but fuck it.

3736
02:24:23,710 --> 02:24:24,030
Yeah.

3737
02:24:27,630 --> 02:24:28,930
Well run drills on that one.

3738
02:24:28,950 --> 02:24:29,210
Fuck!

3739
02:24:29,270 --> 02:24:29,630
Yeah.

3740
02:24:31,470 --> 02:24:32,110
No biggie.

3741
02:24:32,170 --> 02:24:32,450
No biggie.

3742
02:24:37,740 --> 02:24:38,460
Oh, nice!

3743
02:24:38,800 --> 02:24:39,440
Does he know how to get up?

3744
02:24:40,360 --> 02:24:41,340
I know that move.

3745
02:24:45,920 --> 02:24:46,280
Rayjar?

3746
02:24:46,840 --> 02:24:47,200
Fuck.

3747
02:24:47,480 --> 02:24:47,840
Yeah.

3748
02:24:48,540 --> 02:24:50,680
I knew it was low, but I didn't know how to beat it.

3749
02:24:50,820 --> 02:24:51,180
Like...

3750
02:24:51,580 --> 02:24:53,260
Rayjar would have beat that and follow up.

3751
02:24:53,860 --> 02:24:54,220
Okay.

3752
02:24:54,340 --> 02:24:54,620
No.

3753
02:24:55,140 --> 02:24:55,500
Fight!

3754
02:24:57,580 --> 02:24:58,120
Oh, nice!

3755
02:24:58,300 --> 02:24:58,540
I won two.

3756
02:24:58,700 --> 02:24:59,060
Oh.

3757
02:25:02,320 --> 02:25:08,660
Dude, he's just getting that low and since I can't power crush it, I'm not doing anything about it, but he's doing it every time.

3758
02:25:10,100 --> 02:25:11,540
He like downloaded you.

3759
02:25:12,080 --> 02:25:12,680
There you go.

3760
02:25:13,300 --> 02:25:14,720
No, he's coding for it.

3761
02:25:14,840 --> 02:25:14,960
He's fine.

3762
02:25:15,820 --> 02:25:16,600
Oh, god.

3763
02:25:17,240 --> 02:25:18,960
Like, I know what you want, dude.

3764
02:25:21,640 --> 02:25:25,560
I know what this fucking guy wants, it's just I have to learn how to beat it.

3765
02:25:25,600 --> 02:25:25,880
It's annoying.

3766
02:25:27,220 --> 02:25:27,620
Fight!

3767
02:25:36,300 --> 02:25:38,180
I gotta stop doing that... oh, never mind.

3768
02:25:38,420 --> 02:25:41,060
Why does he keep getting hit with it some half the time?

3769
02:25:41,160 --> 02:25:42,220
It makes no sense to me.

3770
02:25:42,480 --> 02:25:45,280
And he's probably just guessing the, like a mix-up instead of reaction.

3771
02:25:50,260 --> 02:25:51,420
Ugh, yeah, okay.

3772
02:25:51,840 --> 02:25:52,600
Oh, okay.

3773
02:25:52,700 --> 02:25:55,620
Ah, it's just so much... it's just mashing, dude.

3774
02:25:55,780 --> 02:25:56,600
It's just, I don't...

3775
02:25:57,400 --> 02:25:58,120
Smash party!

3776
02:25:58,620 --> 02:25:59,000
I know.

3777
02:25:59,180 --> 02:25:59,900
I know what to do.

3778
02:25:59,960 --> 02:26:00,880
I'm just trying to hopkick it.

3779
02:26:01,020 --> 02:26:01,320
You got it.

3780
02:26:01,400 --> 02:26:01,720
You got it.

3781
02:26:01,760 --> 02:26:01,820
Yeah.

3782
02:26:02,360 --> 02:26:03,920
Just try and mash floor instead.

3783
02:26:04,120 --> 02:26:05,500
If you can, mentally adapt.

3784
02:26:05,520 --> 02:26:06,560
But not a big deal.

3785
02:26:06,620 --> 02:26:07,100
Fuck it.

3786
02:26:10,880 --> 02:26:11,240
Nice!

3787
02:26:11,240 --> 02:26:12,360
That's what we talked about!

3788
02:26:17,390 --> 02:26:17,930
Thank you!

3789
02:26:18,030 --> 02:26:18,790
Oh no!

3790
02:26:20,430 --> 02:26:21,650
I'll be able to do that one day.

3791
02:26:21,650 --> 02:26:23,490
Dude, it's the same fucking thing!

3792
02:26:23,590 --> 02:26:24,230
Every time!

3793
02:26:26,010 --> 02:26:27,050
Oh my god, my controller died?

3794
02:26:27,050 --> 02:26:28,410
Okay, it's fine.

3795
02:26:28,630 --> 02:26:29,270
Wake up!

3796
02:26:29,270 --> 02:26:29,610
Wake up!

3797
02:26:30,130 --> 02:26:30,950
That's insane, dude.

3798
02:26:33,730 --> 02:26:34,170
Quick!

3799
02:26:34,450 --> 02:26:35,730
Plug in the mouse and keys!

3800
02:26:36,770 --> 02:26:37,730
It was alley kick.

3801
02:26:39,470 --> 02:26:40,490
It was alley kick.

3802
02:26:40,710 --> 02:26:40,970
It was alley kick.

3803
02:26:40,970 --> 02:26:41,450
Oh my god.

3804
02:26:43,030 --> 02:26:44,110
I could have alley kicked.

3805
02:26:49,630 --> 02:26:51,130
After running through, hopkick.

3806
02:26:58,490 --> 02:26:58,930
Nice.

3807
02:27:03,390 --> 02:27:03,870
Hopkick.

3808
02:27:04,330 --> 02:27:04,810
Nice!

3809
02:27:05,050 --> 02:27:05,930
Now I see it.

3810
02:27:07,570 --> 02:27:08,430
Good combo!

3811
02:27:08,830 --> 02:27:09,730
We're on the wall.

3812
02:27:10,650 --> 02:27:12,010
Take him to the other side!

3813
02:27:12,310 --> 02:27:12,730
Let's go!

3814
02:27:12,950 --> 02:27:13,430
Yes!

3815
02:27:15,810 --> 02:27:16,290
Yo!

3816
02:27:16,370 --> 02:27:17,030
He might be dead!

3817
02:27:17,730 --> 02:27:18,670
One more hit!

3818
02:27:19,030 --> 02:27:19,510
Yeah!

3819
02:27:20,150 --> 02:27:20,610
Good job.

3820
02:27:22,570 --> 02:27:24,130
Just making it close for content.

3821
02:27:32,630 --> 02:27:33,890
Just trying to get space.

3822
02:27:35,190 --> 02:27:35,630
Stucked.

3823
02:27:36,770 --> 02:27:37,210
Nice.

3824
02:27:40,050 --> 02:27:41,450
Fuck, man.

3825
02:27:41,690 --> 02:27:43,650
We gotta try to stay aggressive.

3826
02:27:44,050 --> 02:27:44,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3827
02:27:45,050 --> 02:27:47,090
Good grab.

3828
02:27:48,930 --> 02:27:49,370
Woo!

3829
02:27:54,620 --> 02:27:58,020
Okay, I didn't know what that was, so I didn't do anything about it.

3830
02:27:58,040 --> 02:27:59,140
I was like, what the fuck is this?

3831
02:27:59,920 --> 02:28:00,460
It's okay.

3832
02:28:00,480 --> 02:28:01,220
It's hard to react to.

3833
02:28:01,300 --> 02:28:02,500
That's a block.

3834
02:28:02,500 --> 02:28:06,800
I will absolutely beat this guy if I just learn this dragon.

3835
02:28:06,920 --> 02:28:08,280
Cause like, I keep trying to...

3836
02:28:08,280 --> 02:28:10,520
I know it's the low every time.

3837
02:28:10,600 --> 02:28:11,700
I just keep trying to hopkick it.

3838
02:28:11,800 --> 02:28:12,460
I just need practice.

3839
02:28:12,960 --> 02:28:13,360
Yeah.

3840
02:28:13,580 --> 02:28:16,580
And then that three hit string too, it keeps counter hitting you.

3841
02:28:16,640 --> 02:28:18,540
You could just duck and launch in for it.

3842
02:28:19,180 --> 02:28:19,780
I'll be ready.

3843
02:28:19,900 --> 02:28:21,520
Also, the low can't kill you.

3844
02:28:21,600 --> 02:28:27,080
Like most lows in this game, unless they're giant reactable ones, they're just meant to annoy you and get you to duck.

3845
02:28:27,160 --> 02:28:29,720
So like, you're getting really frustrated about the low existing.

3846
02:28:29,880 --> 02:28:32,120
It's like, early on, it's okay to eat...

3847
02:28:32,500 --> 02:28:32,860
eat it, right?

3848
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:34,560
It's like, keeping composure...

3849
02:28:34,560 --> 02:28:36,620
while getting a load is more important.

3850
02:28:36,900 --> 02:28:40,100
Also, if you're calling it out that hard, low parry mixup...

3851
02:28:40,960 --> 02:28:41,780
Oh, true.

3852
02:28:41,920 --> 02:28:42,760
I didn't even think of that.

3853
02:28:42,860 --> 02:28:44,480
You know, just slap him in the head about it.

3854
02:28:44,480 --> 02:28:49,420
If you want to avoid the whole like, trying to think of while standing for or launch, parry, you know.

3855
02:28:50,100 --> 02:28:51,040
I can beat that guy.

3856
02:28:51,160 --> 02:28:51,760
I'll beat that guy.

3857
02:28:51,900 --> 02:28:52,240
I believe.

3858
02:28:52,540 --> 02:28:53,820
I know you can, Coney.

3859
02:28:54,520 --> 02:28:55,600
You got this.

3860
02:28:56,560 --> 02:28:57,680
You got this, dude.

3861
02:28:57,780 --> 02:28:58,300
Grudge match.

3862
02:28:58,440 --> 02:28:58,740
Grudge match.

3863
02:28:59,300 --> 02:28:59,960
Oh, god.

3864
02:29:00,060 --> 02:29:01,080
He's probably got...

3865
02:29:01,080 --> 02:29:02,360
Dude, he's scary.

3866
02:29:02,500 --> 02:29:04,700
I'm ready, but... Bro, look at that rig.

3867
02:29:04,800 --> 02:29:05,540
You got this.

3868
02:29:08,480 --> 02:29:10,360
I don't mean to disrespect him.

3869
02:29:10,440 --> 02:29:12,120
I didn't hide my barrier.

3870
02:29:12,160 --> 02:29:16,200
We played a bunch yesterday, so it's like, it's definitely a meta matchup of like... Yeah, there's...

3871
02:29:16,200 --> 02:29:17,500
We're gonna see layers when we watch this.

3872
02:29:17,680 --> 02:29:18,260
We're gonna see layers.

3873
02:29:18,700 --> 02:29:19,820
I thought he was on a list.

3874
02:29:19,900 --> 02:29:20,360
Why'd he swap?

3875
02:29:21,780 --> 02:29:23,100
Uh, he thought she was lame.

3876
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:24,640
She is.

3877
02:29:24,720 --> 02:29:25,180
He's right.

3878
02:29:25,300 --> 02:29:26,480
He's 100% right.

3879
02:29:26,640 --> 02:29:27,180
Face, real.

3880
02:29:27,460 --> 02:29:28,140
Appreciate it.

3881
02:29:28,580 --> 02:29:30,520
Get ready for the next battle.

3882
02:29:33,220 --> 02:29:34,080
We're in the same house.

3883
02:29:34,140 --> 02:29:34,680
See what the ping is.

3884
02:29:37,660 --> 02:29:38,060
17.

3885
02:29:38,280 --> 02:29:39,320
I'm gonna say 17.

3886
02:29:40,640 --> 02:29:41,040
Yup.

3887
02:29:41,980 --> 02:29:42,380
Wow.

3888
02:29:43,480 --> 02:29:43,880
Fight.

3889
02:29:46,760 --> 02:29:48,600
You can launch this while sending one, by the way.

3890
02:29:55,020 --> 02:29:56,220
Oh, it's minus 14.

3891
02:30:07,960 --> 02:30:08,880
Definitely playing different.

3892
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:09,700
He's not doing orbital.

3893
02:30:10,220 --> 02:30:10,780
That's fine.

3894
02:30:12,200 --> 02:30:13,520
You're learning now.

3895
02:30:14,220 --> 02:30:15,060
You're learning now.

3896
02:30:29,700 --> 02:30:30,820
Bug it!

3897
02:30:40,910 --> 02:30:45,450
So then we do the grab and stuff and running 1 plus 2 makes the difference.

3898
02:30:50,400 --> 02:30:52,000
And down back 4, also.

3899
02:30:56,170 --> 02:30:56,730
Okay.

3900
02:30:57,290 --> 02:30:57,850
Aww.

3901
02:30:59,850 --> 02:31:00,410
Nice.

3902
02:31:05,590 --> 02:31:06,150
Cool.

3903
02:31:06,370 --> 02:31:06,690
Okay.

3904
02:31:07,010 --> 02:31:07,630
Nice!

3905
02:31:07,630 --> 02:31:08,270
Good shit!

3906
02:31:08,570 --> 02:31:09,050
Yeah!

3907
02:31:09,450 --> 02:31:10,010
Let's go!

3908
02:31:15,050 --> 02:31:17,630
He's gonna start wiggling now because he thinks I'm gonna do that.

3909
02:31:19,790 --> 02:31:21,170
Oh my god, the mind games.

3910
02:31:23,330 --> 02:31:24,070
Nice breaks.

3911
02:31:24,610 --> 02:31:27,130
Oh my god, he just used his first hit.

3912
02:31:27,910 --> 02:31:29,150
Come on, Bear Joe!

3913
02:31:34,180 --> 02:31:34,660
Yo!

3914
02:31:35,040 --> 02:31:35,340
Oh!

3915
02:31:35,620 --> 02:31:36,880
Okay, better than nothing.

3916
02:31:36,920 --> 02:31:37,360
Let's get it.

3917
02:31:37,520 --> 02:31:38,640
That damage.

3918
02:31:42,220 --> 02:31:42,980
Nice breaks.

3919
02:31:45,940 --> 02:31:48,380
Wow, I mean that's literally layered.

3920
02:31:48,700 --> 02:31:49,120
Good shit!

3921
02:31:49,120 --> 02:31:51,620
You've played this guy for five years and you just know what he's gonna do.

3922
02:31:55,040 --> 02:31:56,360
Oh, he's looking for it.

3923
02:31:58,240 --> 02:31:59,040
Yes, sir!

3924
02:32:00,500 --> 02:32:01,520
I guess he's over it all.

3925
02:32:01,860 --> 02:32:02,760
Oh, there it is.

3926
02:32:02,980 --> 02:32:04,260
Finally pulled it out round three.

3927
02:32:04,300 --> 02:32:05,180
Round... last round.

3928
02:32:06,600 --> 02:32:07,620
That's what destroys me.

3929
02:32:10,060 --> 02:32:10,480
Shit.

3930
02:32:12,880 --> 02:32:13,860
What a counter hit.

3931
02:32:14,400 --> 02:32:14,840
Shit.

3932
02:32:24,870 --> 02:32:26,190
Oh, you're still alive.

3933
02:32:26,550 --> 02:32:26,770
Oh, yeah.

3934
02:32:27,970 --> 02:32:30,130
He did a lot of damage on the first leap though.

3935
02:32:31,170 --> 02:32:33,130
So, I mean, he earns it all back but...

3936
02:32:33,130 --> 02:32:34,490
I think he's...

3937
02:32:34,490 --> 02:32:34,830
He's not gaining.

3938
02:32:35,470 --> 02:32:36,750
He's not gonna run up to me.

3939
02:32:37,170 --> 02:32:38,170
He runs up to me.

3940
02:32:39,730 --> 02:32:40,170
Oh!

3941
02:32:40,170 --> 02:32:40,490
Oh!

3942
02:32:41,390 --> 02:32:41,830
Oh!

3943
02:32:42,210 --> 02:32:42,570
Oh!

3944
02:32:42,570 --> 02:32:42,750
Oh!

3945
02:32:43,010 --> 02:32:43,830
Very close.

3946
02:32:43,950 --> 02:32:44,850
A close game, dude.

3947
02:32:44,870 --> 02:32:45,950
Oh, that's so close.

3948
02:32:45,950 --> 02:32:47,010
Real close, real close.

3949
02:32:47,110 --> 02:32:47,430
Oh, that's so close.

3950
02:32:47,430 --> 02:32:48,110
Well, you are the one that wins.

3951
02:32:48,510 --> 02:32:48,910
Oh.

3952
02:32:51,430 --> 02:32:52,230
Oh god.

3953
02:32:52,330 --> 02:32:52,710
But you...

3954
02:32:52,710 --> 02:32:53,530
But you adapted...

3955
02:32:53,530 --> 02:32:55,190
You know, so you already know what to do.

3956
02:32:55,430 --> 02:32:56,690
Yeah, I think he's...

3957
02:32:56,690 --> 02:32:57,150
All right.

3958
02:32:57,230 --> 02:32:57,610
That's fine.

3959
02:32:57,790 --> 02:32:59,290
I think he's just stronger at adapting.

3960
02:33:00,330 --> 02:33:01,070
No, dude.

3961
02:33:01,250 --> 02:33:01,670
I feel like...

3962
02:33:01,670 --> 02:33:03,630
You, when you adapted, it went way better.

3963
02:33:03,970 --> 02:33:04,770
Yeah, you...

3964
02:33:04,770 --> 02:33:05,410
He was one...

3965
02:33:05,410 --> 02:33:05,930
He was 2-0.

3966
02:33:06,090 --> 02:33:06,910
You came back.

3967
02:33:07,110 --> 02:33:07,470
Yeah.

3968
02:33:07,890 --> 02:33:09,130
He got this, bro.

3969
02:33:15,850 --> 02:33:16,690
Has a long hit.

3970
02:33:16,930 --> 02:33:17,330
Nice!

3971
02:33:21,960 --> 02:33:22,660
He's accuracy, dude.

3972
02:33:22,940 --> 02:33:23,340
He's accuracy, dude.

3973
02:33:42,700 --> 02:33:44,280
I don't blame you for keeping this in there.

3974
02:33:44,460 --> 02:33:44,840
I thought it worked.

3975
02:33:44,940 --> 02:33:45,960
Yeah, I would have done it too.

3976
02:33:46,640 --> 02:33:47,540
Yeah, I don't blame you.

3977
02:33:49,220 --> 02:33:49,900
That bait.

3978
02:34:00,640 --> 02:34:00,980
Nice.

3979
02:34:05,410 --> 02:34:06,470
Nice bait, dude.

3980
02:34:06,650 --> 02:34:07,250
Good shit!

3981
02:34:11,190 --> 02:34:11,870
Oh nice!

3982
02:34:14,710 --> 02:34:15,390
Yup, yup!

3983
02:34:18,170 --> 02:34:19,050
Oh my...

3984
02:34:19,050 --> 02:34:20,430
Yeah, get out of here, pal!

3985
02:34:20,630 --> 02:34:21,230
Get out of here.

3986
02:34:21,710 --> 02:34:22,150
Leave!

3987
02:34:23,650 --> 02:34:24,090
Okay.

3988
02:34:29,060 --> 02:34:30,000
He can't do the upgrade.

3989
02:34:30,600 --> 02:34:31,540
Not yet, at least.

3990
02:34:37,350 --> 02:34:37,790
Nice.

3991
02:34:41,150 --> 02:34:41,590
Yo!

3992
02:34:51,080 --> 02:34:53,040
What a fucking low blow, dude.

3993
02:34:54,700 --> 02:34:55,900
See, you're adapting!

3994
02:34:56,340 --> 02:34:56,780
See, you're adapting!

3995
02:34:57,260 --> 02:34:57,820
See, you're adapting!

3996
02:34:58,780 --> 02:35:00,000
Are you bombing?

3997
02:35:08,290 --> 02:35:08,890
Hell yeah.

3998
02:35:12,480 --> 02:35:13,580
I'm not trying to do that.

3999
02:35:14,020 --> 02:35:14,780
I'm not trying to do that.

4000
02:35:17,370 --> 02:35:17,810
Okay.

4001
02:35:18,410 --> 02:35:18,850
Okay.

4002
02:35:24,350 --> 02:35:25,430
What a G-Club!

4003
02:35:25,710 --> 02:35:25,810
What a G-Club!

4004
02:35:26,870 --> 02:35:29,010
That's a bear player if you've ever seen one, dude.

4005
02:35:29,170 --> 02:35:29,230
That's a bear player if you've ever seen one, dude.

4006
02:35:29,230 --> 02:35:30,870
One day I'll be just as patient.

4007
02:35:32,470 --> 02:35:32,910
Nice!

4008
02:35:34,410 --> 02:35:34,850
Oh my god!

4009
02:35:34,850 --> 02:35:37,050
I could field all the ears from here.

4010
02:35:37,130 --> 02:35:37,630
Oh!

4011
02:35:38,650 --> 02:35:39,970
Alright, my game just caught up.

4012
02:35:40,030 --> 02:35:40,350
Good shit.

4013
02:35:41,270 --> 02:35:42,150
I'm literally behind.

4014
02:35:42,250 --> 02:35:42,670
Well done.

4015
02:35:43,610 --> 02:35:46,010
By the way, Konyo, you didn't know he won that set?

4016
02:35:46,430 --> 02:35:47,010
That's you?

4017
02:35:47,090 --> 02:35:47,350
Yup.

4018
02:35:47,410 --> 02:35:47,890
Good to know.

4019
02:35:48,190 --> 02:35:49,250
Mine's chocolate or export.

4020
02:35:51,850 --> 02:35:54,850
Remember that spectating when you spectated Supermatch?

4021
02:35:54,910 --> 02:35:55,990
That was so funny.

4022
02:35:56,150 --> 02:35:56,890
He went SSJ.

4023
02:35:57,850 --> 02:35:58,590
Dragon Ball Z.

4024
02:36:01,070 --> 02:36:02,190
Bro, it's blockade.

4025
02:36:03,390 --> 02:36:04,270
Oh my god.

4026
02:36:04,610 --> 02:36:06,150
He lost half his bar to chip.

4027
02:36:06,210 --> 02:36:06,970
Fucking orbital, man.

4028
02:36:07,030 --> 02:36:07,110
I'm gonna go for the kill.

4029
02:36:07,130 --> 02:36:08,110
Okay, I hit the wall here.

4030
02:36:10,510 --> 02:36:11,030
Oh!

4031
02:36:11,030 --> 02:36:11,550
Nice!

4032
02:36:12,290 --> 02:36:13,030
Nice block.

4033
02:36:13,130 --> 02:36:13,770
Nice job.

4034
02:36:19,800 --> 02:36:20,320
Nice!

4035
02:36:20,380 --> 02:36:20,640
Nice.

4036
02:36:23,240 --> 02:36:24,700
He's not adapting anymore!

4037
02:36:26,780 --> 02:36:28,700
Dude, I fucking low parried, bro.

4038
02:36:28,720 --> 02:36:29,920
I'm so fucking mad.

4039
02:36:30,820 --> 02:36:32,700
Oh my god, the input was there.

4040
02:36:54,210 --> 02:36:55,570
And there's one grab.

4041
02:36:59,810 --> 02:37:00,990
And that was it.

4042
02:37:01,830 --> 02:37:02,950
No he's reading Hellsweep.

4043
02:37:03,030 --> 02:37:04,110
I'm not gonna do Hellsweep anymore.

4044
02:37:04,230 --> 02:37:04,530
Rest again.

4045
02:37:25,930 --> 02:37:26,730
Oh god.

4046
02:37:27,010 --> 02:37:27,350
Oh god.

4047
02:37:28,910 --> 02:37:29,390
It's alright.

4048
02:37:29,530 --> 02:37:30,010
I think he's good.

4049
02:37:30,150 --> 02:37:30,850
That's the problem.

4050
02:37:31,010 --> 02:37:32,350
The problem is if he thinks he's good.

4051
02:37:33,650 --> 02:37:35,970
I know Kony says the same sentence as you, bro.

4052
02:37:36,010 --> 02:37:36,790
True, true.

4053
02:37:39,150 --> 02:37:39,870
There it is.

4054
02:37:40,050 --> 02:37:41,250
See, what even was that?

4055
02:37:41,390 --> 02:37:42,170
Like, that just hit me.

4056
02:37:44,450 --> 02:37:45,770
Unplug his internet right now.

4057
02:38:01,190 --> 02:38:01,650
Nice.

4058
02:38:10,920 --> 02:38:11,780
Dude, I...

4059
02:38:12,880 --> 02:38:14,160
I react pressed.

4060
02:38:16,120 --> 02:38:16,580
Duh.

4061
02:38:17,320 --> 02:38:18,040
Nice try, bro.

4062
02:38:18,120 --> 02:38:18,900
Nice try, nice try.

4063
02:38:19,100 --> 02:38:19,620
It's okay.

4064
02:38:19,900 --> 02:38:20,360
Game 3.

4065
02:38:20,460 --> 02:38:21,360
We got stuff to learn.

4066
02:38:21,440 --> 02:38:21,820
It's all good.

4067
02:38:21,940 --> 02:38:24,100
He's so fucking not good at this game.

4068
02:38:26,520 --> 02:38:29,360
Yeah, I don't know who this guy is, but fuck that man.

4069
02:38:32,760 --> 02:38:33,560
That's Tekken.

4070
02:38:40,340 --> 02:38:40,780
It's alright.

4071
02:38:40,860 --> 02:38:42,300
He showed all his cards.

4072
02:38:42,440 --> 02:38:42,980
It's okay.

4073
02:38:43,180 --> 02:38:44,580
He knows no more moves.

4074
02:38:48,020 --> 02:38:48,900
Yeah, we'll go...

4075
02:38:48,900 --> 02:38:51,740
Dude, I can go over this right after the round robin, man.

4076
02:38:52,520 --> 02:38:54,260
Yeah, I would love to.

4077
02:38:55,640 --> 02:38:57,340
Yeah, it's gotta suck losing to the roommate.

4078
02:38:57,480 --> 02:38:57,940
You know what I mean?

4079
02:38:58,080 --> 02:38:59,460
Yeah, go to his room right now and unplug.

4080
02:38:59,640 --> 02:39:01,480
I heard him pop off, too.

4081
02:39:02,160 --> 02:39:03,680
I heard him pop off.

4082
02:39:03,920 --> 02:39:05,060
I heard him pop off.

4083
02:39:05,060 --> 02:39:05,680
Oh, that's...

4084
02:39:05,680 --> 02:39:07,480
I could literally hear him pop off.

4085
02:39:07,660 --> 02:39:08,980
Wow, I mean...

4086
02:39:09,460 --> 02:39:10,280
What are we doing?

4087
02:39:12,180 --> 02:39:12,580
Ugh.

4088
02:39:13,540 --> 02:39:14,400
It's just gross.

4089
02:39:14,880 --> 02:39:16,940
Make him pay for rent for this month.

4090
02:39:19,560 --> 02:39:22,180
Boxbox is hella random, so, you know, we'll see.

4091
02:39:22,760 --> 02:39:24,100
I could get out-randomed here.

4092
02:39:25,600 --> 02:39:26,000
Genuinely.

4093
02:39:34,920 --> 02:39:37,060
Or I could get 7 billion damage for no reason.

4094
02:39:37,180 --> 02:39:39,680
And then read a card crush and then it would be okay.

4095
02:39:39,760 --> 02:39:40,320
Don't worry about it.

4096
02:39:40,820 --> 02:39:42,020
Read a power crush!

4097
02:39:43,360 --> 02:39:45,400
I forgot that, like I say this game.

4098
02:39:45,460 --> 02:39:46,940
You can't do that!

4099
02:39:46,940 --> 02:39:47,380
That is not fair!

4100
02:39:47,400 --> 02:39:48,460
This is something you can do, yeah.

4101
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:50,480
Oh my god!

4102
02:39:51,400 --> 02:39:52,340
That was crazy.

4103
02:39:53,040 --> 02:39:54,800
Just tilt him right now.

4104
02:39:55,480 --> 02:39:56,200
Blast him!

4105
02:39:56,960 --> 02:39:58,040
Uh, uh, uh.

4106
02:40:03,500 --> 02:40:05,000
That was a funnest of crazy.

4107
02:40:06,720 --> 02:40:07,280
Mmm.

4108
02:40:07,480 --> 02:40:08,520
Oh my god!

4109
02:40:10,060 --> 02:40:12,000
Jack is fucking brutal, dude!

4110
02:40:12,720 --> 02:40:13,700
Yeah, this is so bad.

4111
02:40:14,040 --> 02:40:15,720
Bro, is he even gonna touch him?

4112
02:40:17,140 --> 02:40:18,260
Round 3.

4113
02:40:18,860 --> 02:40:20,280
He's gonna think about this and...

4114
02:40:20,300 --> 02:40:20,800
He's gonna be like, I'm gonna do this in the next round.

4115
02:40:20,820 --> 02:40:21,760
He's not getting any amount of money.

4116
02:40:25,810 --> 02:40:27,470
Dude, you're gonna be on the ground.

4117
02:40:27,650 --> 02:40:29,390
You've gotta be fucking kidding me.

4118
02:40:29,490 --> 02:40:30,430
Holy shit!

4119
02:40:30,970 --> 02:40:32,270
Alright, well, that was good.

4120
02:40:33,010 --> 02:40:34,830
This was like me against Bugs Bugs yesterday.

4121
02:40:37,850 --> 02:40:39,290
That's funny you said this, Adam.

4122
02:40:41,390 --> 02:40:42,230
That was...

4123
02:40:42,230 --> 02:40:43,430
That was really fast.

4124
02:40:43,830 --> 02:40:45,370
Yeah, that was like 20 seconds.

4125
02:40:45,390 --> 02:40:46,590
Yeah, that was like 20 seconds!

4126
02:40:46,590 --> 02:40:46,790
Okay!

4127
02:40:47,350 --> 02:40:48,810
I mean, I might still fuck up.

4128
02:40:48,810 --> 02:40:49,570
I might still fuck up, you know?

4129
02:40:50,750 --> 02:40:52,430
No, you already fucked with his mental.

4130
02:40:55,370 --> 02:40:57,450
Bugs Bugs has pretty good mental, though.

4131
02:40:59,690 --> 02:41:00,530
From what I've heard.

4132
02:41:00,530 --> 02:41:00,630
He's crying.

4133
02:41:00,850 --> 02:41:01,410
Check your stream.

4134
02:41:01,430 --> 02:41:01,790
He's crying.

4135
02:41:01,810 --> 02:41:02,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4136
02:41:02,050 --> 02:41:02,830
Is he crying right now?

4137
02:41:02,870 --> 02:41:05,250
Oh, I'm mad.

4138
02:41:06,050 --> 02:41:07,450
Did you just like, death in his teammates?

4139
02:41:08,750 --> 02:41:10,470
Is Chaz telling him he did a great job?

4140
02:41:11,130 --> 02:41:12,750
He's in his own echo chamber right now.

4141
02:41:14,630 --> 02:41:15,310
Oh, fuck!

4142
02:41:15,550 --> 02:41:17,190
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

4143
02:41:18,770 --> 02:41:19,990
Oh, drop the sad.

4144
02:41:20,150 --> 02:41:20,390
Yup.

4145
02:41:20,930 --> 02:41:23,310
Yeah, you just... we're just here to make him feel better.

4146
02:41:23,670 --> 02:41:24,850
Yeah, you just...

4147
02:41:24,850 --> 02:41:24,850
we're just here to make him feel better.

4148
02:41:24,870 --> 02:41:25,930
Oh, that was crazy.

4149
02:41:26,130 --> 02:41:26,150
Oh, that was crazy.

4150
02:41:26,310 --> 02:41:29,290
That was nuts.

4151
02:41:29,630 --> 02:41:30,970
He's also not wearing the Ness outfit.

4152
02:41:31,170 --> 02:41:32,030
This is tournament Asuka.

4153
02:41:40,960 --> 02:41:42,040
Oh, no.

4154
02:41:43,120 --> 02:41:44,040
Oh, no.

4155
02:41:44,900 --> 02:41:46,380
This guy's definitely a sinner.

4156
02:41:47,540 --> 02:41:48,180
This guy's definitely a sinner.

4157
02:41:48,180 --> 02:41:48,420
Oh, nice.

4158
02:41:48,880 --> 02:41:50,240
Send him to heaven.

4159
02:41:54,380 --> 02:41:56,060
Why did you do that?

4160
02:41:56,180 --> 02:41:56,400
Why did you do that, bitch?

4161
02:41:56,800 --> 02:41:57,840
What the fuck?

4162
02:41:58,080 --> 02:42:00,500
What the fuck is this, dude?

4163
02:42:00,620 --> 02:42:01,660
Are you guys beefing?

4164
02:42:02,340 --> 02:42:03,400
This is exchange.

4165
02:42:04,940 --> 02:42:05,500
What?

4166
02:42:06,420 --> 02:42:07,940
The James Chan!

4167
02:42:10,380 --> 02:42:11,360
Suck my nuts!

4168
02:42:12,080 --> 02:42:14,040
He did download you!

4169
02:42:14,420 --> 02:42:15,440
This is it!

4170
02:42:15,460 --> 02:42:16,580
It's like a Twitter combo.

4171
02:42:17,960 --> 02:42:19,960
You can't read it because it's all in Korean.

4172
02:42:21,760 --> 02:42:22,640
He's like a jester.

4173
02:42:22,660 --> 02:42:23,680
He's like a Japanese Greninja.

4174
02:42:23,760 --> 02:42:25,020
Like, this shit looks unbeatable.

4175
02:42:25,160 --> 02:42:25,860
Oh my god.

4176
02:42:26,140 --> 02:42:27,600
The forbidden moves.

4177
02:42:29,560 --> 02:42:30,300
Oh, nice.

4178
02:42:30,300 --> 02:42:32,940
Oh my god, he actually downloaded.

4179
02:42:34,520 --> 02:42:35,920
That was a good step, yeah.

4180
02:42:36,800 --> 02:42:38,280
Cool combo, BoxBox.

4181
02:42:38,400 --> 02:42:39,480
Nice 40%.

4182
02:42:41,420 --> 02:42:41,980
However...

4183
02:42:42,600 --> 02:42:43,380
Good hit.

4184
02:42:44,420 --> 02:42:44,700
Ah.

4185
02:42:45,600 --> 02:42:46,160
Oh.

4186
02:42:47,860 --> 02:42:49,280
We're keeping it close here.

4187
02:42:50,900 --> 02:42:51,940
Content, content.

4188
02:42:54,580 --> 02:42:54,880
One.

4189
02:42:55,920 --> 02:42:57,280
Oh my god.

4190
02:42:57,560 --> 02:42:58,160
Oh.

4191
02:42:58,380 --> 02:42:58,920
Oh.

4192
02:42:59,020 --> 02:42:59,400
Oh.

4193
02:43:01,840 --> 02:43:03,940
You are greedy, my friend.

4194
02:43:05,400 --> 02:43:06,120
Punish her.

4195
02:43:06,220 --> 02:43:06,860
It's a sin.

4196
02:43:07,280 --> 02:43:07,880
Perfect.

4197
02:43:09,160 --> 02:43:11,820
That has to be the quickest round ever.

4198
02:43:12,060 --> 02:43:12,900
Greed is a sin.

4199
02:43:13,540 --> 02:43:15,020
It is a speedrun.

4200
02:43:16,900 --> 02:43:19,680
Put that on speedrun.com right now.

4201
02:43:20,180 --> 02:43:21,040
That was fast.

4202
02:43:22,440 --> 02:43:23,880
BoxBox of world record.

4203
02:43:24,680 --> 02:43:25,660
BoxBox run.

4204
02:43:26,760 --> 02:43:27,660
Speedrunning BoxBox.

4205
02:43:29,440 --> 02:43:30,240
2-0.

4206
02:43:30,380 --> 02:43:32,300
What an insane character.

4207
02:43:32,760 --> 02:43:33,420
Holy shit.

4208
02:43:34,400 --> 02:43:36,560
That first round was crazy.

4209
02:43:36,700 --> 02:43:38,900
That 10 years ahead of time read.

4210
02:43:39,060 --> 02:43:39,700
That was crazy.

4211
02:43:41,480 --> 02:43:42,520
How does he do it?

4212
02:43:42,520 --> 02:43:44,680
Someone said that was like 4 perfect rounds.

4213
02:43:44,960 --> 02:43:45,540
Oh my god.

4214
02:43:45,800 --> 02:43:47,020
BoxBox any percent.

4215
02:43:47,100 --> 02:43:47,740
No glitches.

4216
02:43:49,900 --> 02:43:51,500
I'm more of a fan of the glitches category.

4217
02:43:54,800 --> 02:43:57,220
That character looks like a fucking glitch, dude.

4218
02:43:57,380 --> 02:43:58,660
That shit is illegal.

4219
02:43:58,940 --> 02:44:00,720
Like some of that damage is insane.

4220
02:44:00,960 --> 02:44:02,920
I mean 4 perfect rounds.

4221
02:44:03,280 --> 02:44:04,140
Holy shit.

4222
02:44:06,840 --> 02:44:07,920
Get his ass coach.

4223
02:44:08,780 --> 02:44:10,380
Slime death and is he going to beat up his roommate?

4224
02:44:11,080 --> 02:44:11,520
Fight.

4225
02:44:14,060 --> 02:44:14,860
He's like, he's like.

4226
02:44:16,320 --> 02:44:16,760
Retire.

4227
02:44:17,280 --> 02:44:17,720
Retire.

4228
02:44:17,740 --> 02:44:19,700
I was talking about how you might be beating up Joshman because he's dead.

4229
02:44:19,940 --> 02:44:20,940
Oh no no.

4230
02:44:21,060 --> 02:44:24,140
I was talking about how to beat him next time.

4231
02:44:24,380 --> 02:44:25,180
Oh yeah.

4232
02:44:25,520 --> 02:44:26,340
In game.

4233
02:44:26,440 --> 02:44:26,740
In game.

4234
02:44:27,300 --> 02:44:28,200
In game.

4235
02:44:28,980 --> 02:44:29,940
In game.

4236
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:32,600
You gotta fight another freaky Brian.

4237
02:44:34,860 --> 02:44:35,960
Look at the movement.

4238
02:44:36,240 --> 02:44:36,940
Oh my god.

4239
02:44:38,500 --> 02:44:39,460
Oh shit.

4240
02:44:40,880 --> 02:44:42,160
How is he so powerful?

4241
02:44:45,600 --> 02:44:46,800
Oh my gosh.

4242
02:44:47,740 --> 02:44:48,720
I'm gonna do that combo one day.

4243
02:44:48,840 --> 02:44:50,100
He even did the rotation.

4244
02:44:50,780 --> 02:44:51,560
What?

4245
02:44:51,580 --> 02:44:52,080
What?

4246
02:44:52,420 --> 02:44:53,280
What is this?

4247
02:45:00,530 --> 02:45:01,310
What?

4248
02:45:01,450 --> 02:45:02,870
What is this?

4249
02:45:07,770 --> 02:45:08,550
Nice.

4250
02:45:08,890 --> 02:45:09,310
Oh nice.

4251
02:45:14,120 --> 02:45:14,900
Oh.

4252
02:45:15,860 --> 02:45:16,640
Oh.

4253
02:45:17,980 --> 02:45:18,760
Oh jeez.

4254
02:45:18,760 --> 02:45:20,940
Oh jeez.

4255
02:45:22,540 --> 02:45:23,980
Round 3.

4256
02:45:24,760 --> 02:45:25,540
Fight.

4257
02:45:25,940 --> 02:45:26,380
Yeah!

4258
02:45:31,540 --> 02:45:32,060
Oh.

4259
02:45:32,780 --> 02:45:33,300
Oh.

4260
02:45:33,560 --> 02:45:34,080
Oh.

4261
02:45:34,080 --> 02:45:35,280
We love hop kicking this household.

4262
02:45:35,540 --> 02:45:35,760
Nice.

4263
02:45:36,320 --> 02:45:36,840
And boom.

4264
02:45:37,520 --> 02:45:38,560
And maybe one.

4265
02:45:38,940 --> 02:45:40,180
No maybe a local one.

4266
02:45:40,420 --> 02:45:41,580
Eat his ass and go off the wall.

4267
02:45:41,580 --> 02:45:42,160
Take him to the wall.

4268
02:45:45,160 --> 02:45:47,560
Oh my goodness gracious me.

4269
02:45:47,560 --> 02:45:48,680
Eat bro's ass Unk.

4270
02:45:48,940 --> 02:45:50,700
Eat his ass.

4271
02:45:51,200 --> 02:45:52,440
Oh my god.

4272
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:54,000
Get a spoon.

4273
02:45:56,100 --> 02:45:57,580
Get a spoon.

4274
02:45:59,320 --> 02:46:00,080
Scoop it.

4275
02:46:00,340 --> 02:46:01,240
Oh man.

4276
02:46:03,160 --> 02:46:04,080
Oh man.

4277
02:46:06,340 --> 02:46:07,280
Oh man.

4278
02:46:08,420 --> 02:46:08,960
Oh man.

4279
02:46:10,420 --> 02:46:10,960
Oh man.

4280
02:46:10,960 --> 02:46:12,000
He's kinda moving now.

4281
02:46:12,100 --> 02:46:12,360
Wait.

4282
02:46:12,480 --> 02:46:13,200
Oh my god.

4283
02:46:13,260 --> 02:46:14,100
Broke the wall.

4284
02:46:14,460 --> 02:46:15,580
He kinda woke up.

4285
02:46:15,900 --> 02:46:16,280
Yeah.

4286
02:46:16,380 --> 02:46:18,620
Uh oh.

4287
02:46:18,740 --> 02:46:19,520
Oh shit.

4288
02:46:19,600 --> 02:46:20,100
The comeback?

4289
02:46:20,420 --> 02:46:21,400
He said get me outta here.

4290
02:46:21,540 --> 02:46:23,460
Let me out.

4291
02:46:24,480 --> 02:46:25,780
Time for the other wall.

4292
02:46:25,780 --> 02:46:26,480
Uh oh.

4293
02:46:27,160 --> 02:46:28,060
One guess.

4294
02:46:28,060 --> 02:46:28,560
Guess for game.

4295
02:46:28,700 --> 02:46:29,660
Oh no.

4296
02:46:29,760 --> 02:46:30,440
Oh my god.

4297
02:46:30,780 --> 02:46:31,900
I fucked up.

4298
02:46:32,180 --> 02:46:33,340
I almost had it.

4299
02:46:33,380 --> 02:46:34,260
I had a missed input.

4300
02:46:34,820 --> 02:46:35,520
Nice try.

4301
02:46:37,040 --> 02:46:37,580
Oh.

4302
02:46:39,300 --> 02:46:40,380
Yeah yeah.

4303
02:46:40,460 --> 02:46:41,040
We're just getting close.

4304
02:46:50,820 --> 02:46:51,880
False sense of security.

4305
02:47:01,310 --> 02:47:02,130
Oh nice.

4306
02:47:12,360 --> 02:47:13,180
Nice nice.

4307
02:47:17,450 --> 02:47:18,470
That's a freaky Brian.

4308
02:47:18,950 --> 02:47:19,350
Nice.

4309
02:47:19,630 --> 02:47:20,630
Dude that first.

4310
02:47:20,750 --> 02:47:21,750
That last round.

4311
02:47:21,870 --> 02:47:23,630
He did 50% on game start.

4312
02:47:23,750 --> 02:47:24,270
That's crazy.

4313
02:47:24,490 --> 02:47:24,730
Yeah.

4314
02:47:25,450 --> 02:47:28,010
I just realized he has the same costume as the other one.

4315
02:47:31,440 --> 02:47:31,680
Fight.

4316
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:37,580
The amount of times I've been hit by that while trying to fight BrawlPro dude.

4317
02:47:37,800 --> 02:47:38,400
I'm sorry.

4318
02:47:40,640 --> 02:47:41,040
Nice.

4319
02:47:44,440 --> 02:47:44,960
Get up.

4320
02:47:45,040 --> 02:47:45,160
Wait.

4321
02:47:45,280 --> 02:47:46,060
You can do that?

4322
02:47:46,240 --> 02:47:47,160
What the fuck.

4323
02:47:47,260 --> 02:47:48,380
You can flip him?

4324
02:47:48,540 --> 02:47:48,820
Yeah.

4325
02:47:48,820 --> 02:47:50,380
I saw that.

4326
02:47:50,380 --> 02:47:51,400
That hit him.

4327
02:47:51,580 --> 02:47:52,140
Yo.

4328
02:47:53,520 --> 02:47:55,260
It just rotated him.

4329
02:47:55,420 --> 02:47:56,320
What the fuck.

4330
02:47:56,980 --> 02:47:57,880
That's a move.

4331
02:48:00,360 --> 02:48:01,920
He was done on that side.

4332
02:48:02,160 --> 02:48:02,640
Yeah.

4333
02:48:03,380 --> 02:48:04,900
What works at five guys.

4334
02:48:06,420 --> 02:48:07,880
Holy shit man.

4335
02:48:07,940 --> 02:48:08,600
Like a pancake.

4336
02:48:08,940 --> 02:48:11,160
The fact that even Cody didn't know you can flip.

4337
02:48:11,600 --> 02:48:13,220
I've never seen that.

4338
02:48:13,220 --> 02:48:14,740
It did no damage.

4339
02:48:16,520 --> 02:48:18,360
Can you stop comboing man?

4340
02:48:18,800 --> 02:48:19,720
Dude that's crazy.

4341
02:48:19,960 --> 02:48:21,340
That's his character man.

4342
02:48:23,160 --> 02:48:24,460
He's just touch of death.

4343
02:48:26,680 --> 02:48:27,600
Rotate him again.

4344
02:48:27,680 --> 02:48:28,140
Wow.

4345
02:48:28,860 --> 02:48:30,700
It's hard to deal with Brian when he gets walled.

4346
02:48:30,700 --> 02:48:31,540
He's gonna get walled.

4347
02:48:31,640 --> 02:48:34,200
Deal with Brian at the wall.

4348
02:48:34,480 --> 02:48:36,000
It's a really tough stage I think.

4349
02:48:36,460 --> 02:48:36,980
Yeah.

4350
02:48:37,040 --> 02:48:39,340
This stage is fucking scrub lord stage.

4351
02:48:43,220 --> 02:48:44,020
Oh.

4352
02:48:44,220 --> 02:48:44,820
Oh.

4353
02:48:53,020 --> 02:48:53,820
Oh.

4354
02:48:53,820 --> 02:48:54,240
Yeah even though.

4355
02:48:59,040 --> 02:48:59,840
Huge.

4356
02:49:00,180 --> 02:49:00,840
Nice.

4357
02:49:01,080 --> 02:49:01,860
Nice job.

4358
02:49:03,840 --> 02:49:04,920
That's huge.

4359
02:49:04,940 --> 02:49:05,280
Good shit.

4360
02:49:05,640 --> 02:49:07,180
Good shit.

4361
02:49:08,840 --> 02:49:09,640
Mmm.

4362
02:49:14,980 --> 02:49:16,460
Man these combos.

4363
02:49:16,900 --> 02:49:17,280
Man these combos.

4364
02:49:17,280 --> 02:49:18,240
Man these combos.

4365
02:49:21,220 --> 02:49:22,160
At least he doesn't get bounced.

4366
02:49:22,340 --> 02:49:23,740
He never charges that one.

4367
02:49:26,020 --> 02:49:27,320
Oh my god let him breathe.

4368
02:49:31,540 --> 02:49:31,980
Oops.

4369
02:49:35,420 --> 02:49:36,640
There's a bug on the floor.

4370
02:49:36,760 --> 02:49:37,100
Yeah.

4371
02:49:38,520 --> 02:49:39,300
Bug break.

4372
02:49:39,480 --> 02:49:39,900
Him hate spiders.

4373
02:49:47,010 --> 02:49:47,450
Oh.

4374
02:49:47,450 --> 02:49:48,110
So scary.

4375
02:49:48,190 --> 02:49:50,410
Ain't no way coaches are doing spring kicks.

4376
02:49:51,170 --> 02:49:51,610
Oh.

4377
02:49:53,810 --> 02:49:54,910
Oh my god.

4378
02:49:54,910 --> 02:49:55,030
Oh my god.

4379
02:49:55,030 --> 02:49:55,330
And again.

4380
02:49:56,250 --> 02:49:57,050
Oh.

4381
02:49:57,050 --> 02:49:58,270
Oh my goodness.

4382
02:50:00,630 --> 02:50:02,110
Look at those kicks.

4383
02:50:09,590 --> 02:50:10,390
Nice.

4384
02:50:10,390 --> 02:50:11,050
Nice.

4385
02:50:15,260 --> 02:50:16,060
Oh.

4386
02:50:16,740 --> 02:50:18,220
That wave dash back.

4387
02:50:18,300 --> 02:50:19,900
F smash?

4388
02:50:20,360 --> 02:50:21,160
Cracked.

4389
02:50:21,240 --> 02:50:25,560
F sma- Fonsep.

4390
02:50:25,560 --> 02:50:26,160
Fonsep.

4391
02:50:26,320 --> 02:50:27,060
Good shit.

4392
02:50:27,140 --> 02:50:28,880
Let's get off this stage bro.

4393
02:50:29,020 --> 02:50:30,580
That was an easy one.

4394
02:50:30,700 --> 02:50:31,220
Let me out.

4395
02:50:31,700 --> 02:50:33,100
Let me out of this place.

4396
02:50:33,100 --> 02:50:33,840
Are we on stream?

4397
02:50:35,100 --> 02:50:36,060
Nah I don't think so.

4398
02:50:36,280 --> 02:50:37,060
No we're not.

4399
02:50:37,140 --> 02:50:37,860
We were last round.

4400
02:50:37,980 --> 02:50:39,660
I think stage one is stream.

4401
02:50:40,180 --> 02:50:40,620
Nice.

4402
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:45,740
The roll.

4403
02:50:47,800 --> 02:50:48,240
Waldemort?

4404
02:50:49,460 --> 02:50:50,920
I'll be able to do that one day.

4405
02:50:52,660 --> 02:50:53,380
Good shit.

4406
02:50:53,520 --> 02:50:53,900
Dammit.

4407
02:50:55,140 --> 02:50:56,080
Wow that's nuts.

4408
02:51:04,300 --> 02:51:04,740
Dude.

4409
02:51:04,940 --> 02:51:05,920
Ryan is relentless.

4410
02:51:07,540 --> 02:51:08,100
Round two.

4411
02:51:09,270 --> 02:51:09,580
Fight.

4412
02:51:10,740 --> 02:51:11,360
Nice.

4413
02:51:13,060 --> 02:51:13,680
Hehehe.

4414
02:51:14,560 --> 02:51:15,180
Count.

4415
02:51:18,830 --> 02:51:19,830
Oh nice.

4416
02:51:24,990 --> 02:51:26,210
Alright we got a wall.

4417
02:51:33,890 --> 02:51:34,510
Nice.

4418
02:51:34,530 --> 02:51:35,130
Good shit.

4419
02:51:36,090 --> 02:51:37,690
Where'd Blood's base go?

4420
02:51:39,290 --> 02:51:40,870
Send him to the hospital.

4421
02:51:41,230 --> 02:51:42,130
I know I'm crazy under that mask.

4422
02:51:42,350 --> 02:51:43,330
He ain't got no teeth.

4423
02:51:45,670 --> 02:51:46,290
Hmm.

4424
02:51:46,330 --> 02:51:46,530
Hmm.

4425
02:51:49,430 --> 02:51:50,330
Good shit.

4426
02:51:50,450 --> 02:51:50,970
Oh nice.

4427
02:51:51,910 --> 02:51:52,510
Oh.

4428
02:52:00,540 --> 02:52:02,220
Oh my goodness.

4429
02:52:02,220 --> 02:52:03,160
That's a nice punish.

4430
02:52:03,240 --> 02:52:03,760
I love that.

4431
02:52:03,760 --> 02:52:06,360
I love that when it happens in the game.

4432
02:52:08,740 --> 02:52:09,340
Oh.

4433
02:52:09,440 --> 02:52:09,820
Oh.

4434
02:52:09,820 --> 02:52:10,260
Oh no.

4435
02:52:10,680 --> 02:52:12,640
I mean shit happens whatever.

4436
02:52:12,940 --> 02:52:14,480
It's alright you're still alive.

4437
02:52:16,400 --> 02:52:17,000
It's

4438
02:52:21,060 --> 02:52:22,540
getting a little close.

4439
02:52:23,960 --> 02:52:24,260
Oh.

4440
02:52:25,140 --> 02:52:25,340
I got this.

4441
02:52:27,360 --> 02:52:28,240
Oh oh!

4442
02:52:28,460 --> 02:52:28,680
Oh my.

4443
02:52:28,680 --> 02:52:28,780
Oh nice!

4444
02:52:29,020 --> 02:52:29,560
It's ok.

4445
02:52:29,800 --> 02:52:30,040
It's ok.

4446
02:52:33,560 --> 02:52:38,740
He gave you two chances.

4447
02:52:40,060 --> 02:52:41,840
For Bryan two times.

4448
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:43,160
For Bryan two times.

4449
02:52:45,140 --> 02:52:46,980
He parried it twice to let him know he could.

4450
02:52:47,480 --> 02:52:47,960
Yeah yeah.

4451
02:52:48,280 --> 02:52:48,760
Again.

4452
02:52:50,580 --> 02:52:51,920
Just to make a statement.

4453
02:52:51,920 --> 02:52:52,060
I'm in.

4454
02:52:52,160 --> 02:52:54,020
Surely they won't predict another low.

4455
02:52:56,540 --> 02:52:57,920
They'll never learn.

4456
02:52:58,200 --> 02:52:58,820
Nice.

4457
02:52:59,080 --> 02:53:00,000
The Doki!

4458
02:53:01,520 --> 02:53:03,140
The Doki LOL.

4459
02:53:07,200 --> 02:53:08,440
Learnings for chumps.

4460
02:53:12,650 --> 02:53:14,160
Guess for your life, LickyPie.

4461
02:53:14,240 --> 02:53:14,860
Nice job.

4462
02:53:14,860 --> 02:53:16,280
F***ing guess for game, bro.

4463
02:53:16,400 --> 02:53:16,980
God bless.

4464
02:53:17,160 --> 02:53:18,400
On that stage too?

4465
02:53:18,840 --> 02:53:19,740
He's talented.

4466
02:53:20,120 --> 02:53:20,980
Let's go BP.

4467
02:53:20,980 --> 02:53:23,280
Bro Pro Team is on top right now.

4468
02:53:23,540 --> 02:53:27,780
If you just didn't get hit by those kicks he did, the little jump shit, it would have been way...

4469
02:53:27,780 --> 02:53:29,560
Because he would just pop that at start, you know?

4470
02:53:30,320 --> 02:53:31,520
Yeah, I can explain too.

4471
02:53:31,840 --> 02:53:32,780
When I'm f***ing...

4472
02:53:32,780 --> 02:53:35,740
You know when he rage-rided me at the wall and I did like a back two randomly?

4473
02:53:36,140 --> 02:53:36,400
Yeah.

4474
02:53:37,440 --> 02:53:39,280
It snapped back on my stick.

4475
02:53:39,340 --> 02:53:42,840
So if I fling forward, forward, it'll go the opposite direction because of the flick.

4476
02:53:43,440 --> 02:53:46,460
And then the same with right there at the Shining Wizard at the end.

4477
02:53:46,560 --> 02:53:50,220
I flicked it forward three times really fast and then it flicked back and reset neutral.

4478
02:53:50,260 --> 02:53:50,960
And I'm like, oh my god.

4479
02:53:50,980 --> 02:53:52,400
So I have to be careful.

4480
02:53:52,780 --> 02:53:53,220
That's all.

4481
02:53:54,460 --> 02:53:55,600
Oh, that was crazy though.

4482
02:53:55,640 --> 02:53:58,440
That second low parry, that was so crazy.

4483
02:53:58,860 --> 02:53:59,440
Shit bro.

4484
02:53:59,640 --> 02:54:01,000
Yeah, I can't believe you got two of them.

4485
02:54:01,080 --> 02:54:01,880
I thought you f***ed up.

4486
02:54:01,920 --> 02:54:02,760
I was like, shit, we...

4487
02:54:02,760 --> 02:54:04,060
Guys, I think he wants to fight me again.

4488
02:54:04,120 --> 02:54:05,120
I'm going to fight Brock's box again.

4489
02:54:07,560 --> 02:54:11,520
He literally joined the lobby as I was checkmarked because I was like, oh, I'm going to fight Tone.

4490
02:54:11,660 --> 02:54:12,240
But Tone didn't win.

4491
02:54:12,380 --> 02:54:14,220
Dude, Raiditz lost to James Chie...

4492
02:54:14,220 --> 02:54:15,160
I got to watch these sets.

4493
02:54:15,540 --> 02:54:16,300
I got to...

4494
02:54:16,660 --> 02:54:17,500
That's f***ing crazy.

4495
02:54:17,500 --> 02:54:20,120
There's so much content to watch once we're f***ing done.

4496
02:54:20,160 --> 02:54:20,340
Okay.

4497
02:54:20,380 --> 02:54:20,840
I'm going to go back to the chat.

4498
02:54:22,260 --> 02:54:24,300
Get ready for the next battle.

4499
02:54:24,900 --> 02:54:26,600
Time to watch the rematch.

4500
02:54:28,040 --> 02:54:29,240
I guess this is a rematch.

4501
02:54:29,340 --> 02:54:29,540
Maybe the...

4502
02:54:29,540 --> 02:54:30,040
Salty runback.

4503
02:54:30,100 --> 02:54:30,580
Salty runback.

4504
02:54:30,980 --> 02:54:31,740
I like that.

4505
02:54:31,840 --> 02:54:32,340
I like...

4506
02:54:32,340 --> 02:54:34,220
I like how boxbox is a f***ing gamer about it.

4507
02:54:35,540 --> 02:54:36,580
Yeah, he's a...

4508
02:54:36,580 --> 02:54:38,200
He's a hardcore gamer, dude.

4509
02:54:38,840 --> 02:54:39,240
Fight!

4510
02:54:39,660 --> 02:54:40,440
He's like, let's go.

4511
02:54:41,940 --> 02:54:42,960
Where is this streaming at?

4512
02:54:43,140 --> 02:54:43,780
Boxbox's streaming?

4513
02:54:57,990 --> 02:54:58,670
F***ing bitch.

4514
02:54:58,710 --> 02:54:58,950
I don't even know what's going on.

4515
02:54:58,950 --> 02:54:59,290
I'm sorry.

4516
02:55:01,110 --> 02:55:02,370
I hate this guy.

4517
02:55:03,170 --> 02:55:04,410
The rage arts.

4518
02:55:05,530 --> 02:55:09,350
I'm going to use the bathroom real quick while you watch this rematch of the century.

4519
02:55:09,590 --> 02:55:09,830
He is evil.

4520
02:55:09,950 --> 02:55:11,350
He is special evil with it.

4521
02:55:14,530 --> 02:55:15,110
Nice watch.

4522
02:55:27,420 --> 02:55:30,660
Yeah, he did.

4523
02:55:31,100 --> 02:55:32,820
It was a close set, you know?

4524
02:55:33,120 --> 02:55:35,440
I feel like he was sandbagging when I was watching.

4525
02:55:35,440 --> 02:55:36,180
I don't know, man.

4526
02:55:36,300 --> 02:55:37,260
What was up with that?

4527
02:55:37,740 --> 02:55:39,040
He finished all the combos.

4528
02:55:39,380 --> 02:55:42,140
You drop them sometimes though, Slime.

4529
02:55:42,180 --> 02:55:43,440
The B&Bs.

4530
02:55:43,840 --> 02:55:46,160
And also, let's say you do the hopkick.

4531
02:55:46,300 --> 02:55:48,700
You'll do one back 2-1 in the hunting bear stance.

4532
02:55:48,860 --> 02:55:49,320
You could do two.

4533
02:55:49,460 --> 02:55:51,740
Back 2-1, back 2-1, then the bear stance.

4534
02:55:52,060 --> 02:55:52,440
Right.

4535
02:55:53,420 --> 02:55:55,960
If I want to do it, I shouldn't in the first place.

4536
02:55:56,740 --> 02:55:57,140
Yeah.

4537
02:55:58,800 --> 02:56:00,420
We are on stage 3 now.

4538
02:56:02,340 --> 02:56:02,740
Okay.

4539
02:56:09,300 --> 02:56:10,240
Oh, they already made the lobby.

4540
02:56:10,480 --> 02:56:10,760
Jeez.

4541
02:56:11,740 --> 02:56:12,400
Yeah, we are set.

4542
02:56:12,820 --> 02:56:13,100
Lobby.

4543
02:56:15,780 --> 02:56:17,080
Does Matt and I take a game off?

4544
02:56:17,260 --> 02:56:17,540
Sure.

4545
02:56:19,420 --> 02:56:20,020
Oh, a game.

4546
02:56:20,040 --> 02:56:21,140
Okay, I'm back.

4547
02:56:23,160 --> 02:56:24,020
My devil chain?

4548
02:56:24,120 --> 02:56:26,060
He beat my devil chain while we were coaching.

4549
02:56:29,660 --> 02:56:30,200
Oh, no.

4550
02:56:30,520 --> 02:56:30,980
Beginner's ball.

4551
02:56:31,580 --> 02:56:32,820
I don't know if he wants to fight me again.

4552
02:56:33,740 --> 02:56:34,020
Okay.

4553
02:56:34,020 --> 02:56:35,200
Sorry, I have to finish this set.

4554
02:56:35,260 --> 02:56:35,740
I don't know what's going on.

4555
02:56:36,600 --> 02:56:37,460
He wants to fight.

4556
02:56:37,540 --> 02:56:37,860
He wants to fight.

4557
02:56:37,920 --> 02:56:38,200
Let's do it.

4558
02:56:40,120 --> 02:56:40,700
Lobby's up.

4559
02:56:41,200 --> 02:56:42,360
Oh, the lobby's up?

4560
02:56:42,660 --> 02:56:44,280
Yeah, it's up.

4561
02:56:44,440 --> 02:56:45,340
That was so fast.

4562
02:56:46,720 --> 02:56:48,800
Yeah, they're just moving through it.

4563
02:56:48,880 --> 02:56:49,020
Yeah.

4564
02:56:50,060 --> 02:56:51,640
We got two more...

4565
02:56:52,660 --> 02:56:53,580
Two more sets.

4566
02:56:56,860 --> 02:56:58,360
That was the fastest one yet.

4567
02:56:59,620 --> 02:57:00,320
What the hell?

4568
02:57:00,400 --> 02:57:01,960
I'm like stuck in a loading screen.

4569
02:57:08,720 --> 02:57:09,380
I'm in.

4570
02:57:14,350 --> 02:57:15,770
Are you playing the floor rank?

4571
02:57:16,870 --> 02:57:18,670
I can't even get into the lobby.

4572
02:57:18,990 --> 02:57:19,050
It's me.

4573
02:57:19,050 --> 02:57:19,450
Unfortunately.

4574
02:57:22,630 --> 02:57:24,130
Yeah, mine was a little fucky.

4575
02:57:26,090 --> 02:57:28,330
Miles with that Arizona host.

4576
02:57:28,830 --> 02:57:29,510
Let's see.

4577
02:57:30,790 --> 02:57:31,770
I'll just join again.

4578
02:57:32,110 --> 02:57:33,030
See if it...

4579
02:57:36,460 --> 02:57:39,040
Any fellow yellows in the team?

4580
02:57:40,960 --> 02:57:42,720
Maybe I will restart my game.

4581
02:57:42,820 --> 02:57:44,020
Maybe some bronze in the team.

4582
02:57:45,260 --> 02:57:45,780
Okay,

4583
02:58:03,170 --> 02:58:03,170
I'll just go with the same.

4584
02:58:03,170 --> 02:58:05,070
Not everybody's here, so we have lots of time.

4585
02:58:06,310 --> 02:58:06,830
Yeah.

4586
02:58:07,750 --> 02:58:10,450
So Doki, how's your first Sajam Slam so far?

4587
02:58:10,770 --> 02:58:12,030
I think it's pretty fun.

4588
02:58:12,290 --> 02:58:13,590
It's been pretty fun so far.

4589
02:58:15,370 --> 02:58:15,890
Yeah.

4590
02:58:15,910 --> 02:58:16,270
I'm learning.

4591
02:58:16,310 --> 02:58:18,350
I haven't hit my ceiling yet.

4592
02:58:18,690 --> 02:58:20,650
I've been all these other newbies...

4593
02:58:20,650 --> 02:58:22,170
They're already close to the ceiling.

4594
02:58:23,830 --> 02:58:26,070
You're definitely not at your ceiling yet.

4595
02:58:26,270 --> 02:58:26,790
Yeah.

4596
02:58:27,150 --> 02:58:27,670
Oh, you're still there.

4597
02:58:36,180 --> 02:58:40,040
Yeah, on the challenge it says that we lost to MYK, so I'm trying to get that swapped.

4598
02:58:41,940 --> 02:58:42,720
Oh my god.

4599
02:58:42,820 --> 02:58:44,920
Oh, there's like a wrong score?

4600
02:58:45,080 --> 02:58:45,480
Or...

4601
02:58:45,480 --> 02:58:47,260
Yeah, it says MYK beat us 3-2.

4602
02:58:47,800 --> 02:58:48,220
Oh.

4603
02:58:50,580 --> 02:58:51,000
Rigged.

4604
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:51,520
Oh, I see.

4605
02:58:51,700 --> 02:58:53,220
Somebody bribed the coaches.

4606
02:58:57,300 --> 02:59:00,280
If that's how we... if that's what they want... shit.

4607
02:59:00,440 --> 02:59:01,520
I'll wire something up.

4608
02:59:02,600 --> 02:59:04,900
Wire some money real quick to Seijam.

4609
02:59:07,680 --> 02:59:09,240
Give 50 subs.

4610
02:59:11,960 --> 02:59:14,900
Remember slime, when you didn't fill out the stupid evo form?

4611
02:59:15,020 --> 02:59:16,840
I'm very wealthy, don't worry about me.

4612
02:59:17,140 --> 02:59:18,880
You can just do a $40 flight.

4613
02:59:21,840 --> 02:59:22,880
Wait, $40?

4614
02:59:23,380 --> 02:59:24,420
Wait, $40?

4615
02:59:25,040 --> 02:59:25,640
Wait, what?

4616
02:59:25,920 --> 02:59:29,300
Spirit flights are like double digits.

4617
02:59:29,540 --> 02:59:30,800
What are you... what are you...

4618
02:59:32,800 --> 02:59:33,200
$40?

4619
02:59:34,120 --> 02:59:36,500
And Seijam's like, no bro, I got you.

4620
02:59:36,680 --> 02:59:38,380
And it's like, Jesus, he's mad.

4621
02:59:39,080 --> 02:59:39,980
He should be dead.

4622
02:59:40,460 --> 02:59:41,220
On the street.

4623
02:59:41,380 --> 02:59:44,080
Oh fuck, why do I never focus on these?

4624
02:59:44,140 --> 02:59:44,520
Sorry.

4625
02:59:44,780 --> 02:59:45,820
I forgot about the hotel.

4626
02:59:46,820 --> 02:59:48,240
How do you... where are you gonna sleep?

4627
02:59:49,020 --> 02:59:49,940
I don't know bro.

4628
02:59:50,120 --> 02:59:50,840
I'll figure it out.

4629
02:59:51,000 --> 02:59:51,120
Oh!

4630
02:59:51,420 --> 02:59:51,760
Oh!

4631
02:59:51,880 --> 02:59:52,280
Yay!

4632
02:59:54,580 --> 02:59:54,980
Yippee!

4633
02:59:56,240 --> 02:59:57,980
Wait, you can cook this guy.

4634
02:59:58,140 --> 02:59:58,880
I told you!

4635
02:59:59,080 --> 03:00:00,940
I haven't hit my ceiling yet!

4636
03:00:04,080 --> 03:00:05,820
All I can do is up!

4637
03:00:10,400 --> 03:00:12,460
All I can go is up!

4638
03:00:12,480 --> 03:00:13,540
They've hit their ceiling!

4639
03:00:13,700 --> 03:00:14,440
I haven't!

4640
03:00:18,240 --> 03:00:19,780
Look at him flail around.

4641
03:00:20,280 --> 03:00:21,620
He's too fast.

4642
03:00:22,080 --> 03:00:23,600
He's just slowly advancing.

4643
03:00:25,360 --> 03:00:26,840
That was like the Simpsons scene.

4644
03:00:27,680 --> 03:00:30,740
And if you get hit, it's your fault.

4645
03:00:31,840 --> 03:00:33,420
That's literally Jaguarmills.

4646
03:00:33,700 --> 03:00:34,760
Unironically, you seem to be better.

4647
03:00:36,800 --> 03:00:37,820
Is he gonna duck?

4648
03:00:37,860 --> 03:00:39,080
Oh wait, I messed that up.

4649
03:00:39,160 --> 03:00:39,440
Jk.

4650
03:00:39,920 --> 03:00:40,780
Will he duck this time?

4651
03:00:40,780 --> 03:00:42,460
Your 1 plus 2 is so slow.

4652
03:00:42,560 --> 03:00:43,680
We'll work on that though.

4653
03:00:46,480 --> 03:00:47,100
I'll get better.

4654
03:00:47,820 --> 03:00:49,560
I swear I'll get better.

4655
03:00:49,780 --> 03:00:51,640
Oh my god, she's kicking the shit out of him.

4656
03:00:51,700 --> 03:00:52,420
I told you!

4657
03:00:52,820 --> 03:00:55,120
If you hit 3 leg drops, the set is over.

4658
03:00:55,540 --> 03:00:55,980
Creaky!

4659
03:00:56,700 --> 03:00:57,140
No!

4660
03:00:58,460 --> 03:00:59,540
I keep messing that up!

4661
03:00:59,540 --> 03:01:00,760
But it's okay, he's dead.

4662
03:01:01,180 --> 03:01:03,420
This thing is freaky, dude.

4663
03:01:05,480 --> 03:01:06,820
When will you learn?

4664
03:01:07,540 --> 03:01:08,660
You never learn!

4665
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:09,700
Just like me!

4666
03:01:09,940 --> 03:01:11,820
Never mind.

4667
03:01:12,200 --> 03:01:13,120
Never mind, guys.

4668
03:01:13,520 --> 03:01:13,840
Okay.

4669
03:01:14,400 --> 03:01:14,880
No!

4670
03:01:16,100 --> 03:01:17,200
He's learning, guys.

4671
03:01:17,320 --> 03:01:18,040
I don't understand.

4672
03:01:22,220 --> 03:01:23,660
Guys, I don't understand.

4673
03:01:23,780 --> 03:01:24,540
How is he learning?

4674
03:01:28,750 --> 03:01:30,030
Kick him in the head again!

4675
03:01:31,010 --> 03:01:31,210
Yes!

4676
03:01:32,050 --> 03:01:33,130
That's fucking right!

4677
03:01:33,310 --> 03:01:34,230
I'm gonna stab you!

4678
03:01:36,050 --> 03:01:36,910
That's fucking right!

4679
03:01:37,430 --> 03:01:38,670
What else?

4680
03:01:40,530 --> 03:01:41,950
His legs are broken!

4681
03:01:42,370 --> 03:01:44,530
You can't afford your hospital bill!

4682
03:01:48,230 --> 03:01:50,850
That's Joe Rogan yelling armbar, armbar.

4683
03:01:56,060 --> 03:01:56,980
You know what?

4684
03:01:57,020 --> 03:01:57,700
I'll take that.

4685
03:01:57,840 --> 03:01:58,640
I'll take those.

4686
03:01:58,640 --> 03:01:59,600
You'll take two!

4687
03:01:59,980 --> 03:02:01,260
Oh shit, really?

4688
03:02:01,540 --> 03:02:02,180
I'm gonna take him all the way?

4689
03:02:02,360 --> 03:02:03,500
Waiter, one more, please.

4690
03:02:04,420 --> 03:02:05,960
Will he expect this?

4691
03:02:06,080 --> 03:02:06,900
Oh, he did.

4692
03:02:07,520 --> 03:02:08,980
Okay, but will he expect this?

4693
03:02:14,780 --> 03:02:16,760
Oh my fucking god.

4694
03:02:17,960 --> 03:02:20,340
This dude doubles your prowess, by the way.

4695
03:02:20,520 --> 03:02:21,240
I know!

4696
03:02:21,320 --> 03:02:22,060
That's what I'm saying!

4697
03:02:22,460 --> 03:02:23,580
You're melting him!

4698
03:02:23,820 --> 03:02:25,480
Bro, it's like the mental game.

4699
03:02:25,620 --> 03:02:26,560
He knows, too.

4700
03:02:26,560 --> 03:02:28,520
He's like, how am I...

4701
03:02:28,520 --> 03:02:29,800
Fight or flight, doki.

4702
03:02:29,920 --> 03:02:30,540
This is it!

4703
03:02:31,060 --> 03:02:32,580
Oh my god!

4704
03:02:34,940 --> 03:02:37,460
I'll be mad, bro!

4705
03:02:37,780 --> 03:02:38,980
I'll be mad!

4706
03:02:40,860 --> 03:02:41,460
I'll be mad!

4707
03:02:41,460 --> 03:02:43,040
Dude, this is so good.

4708
03:02:43,660 --> 03:02:46,680
You're so straight in front of everyone at Times Square!

4709
03:02:47,340 --> 03:02:47,640
You're so straight in front of everyone at Times Square!

4710
03:02:47,640 --> 03:02:47,980
I know!

4711
03:02:48,140 --> 03:02:49,240
He's so embarrassed!

4712
03:02:50,260 --> 03:02:51,660
Like, how are you doing?

4713
03:02:51,980 --> 03:02:53,880
How are you letting me do this to you?

4714
03:02:54,060 --> 03:02:55,580
I'll convert my goat.

4715
03:02:56,560 --> 03:02:57,440
What the fuck?

4716
03:02:57,900 --> 03:02:59,400
Okay, now he's actually mad.

4717
03:03:01,060 --> 03:03:02,580
He has to be pissed.

4718
03:03:04,920 --> 03:03:06,500
Yup, onto the street.

4719
03:03:07,240 --> 03:03:08,700
Bro, why are you not learning?

4720
03:03:09,280 --> 03:03:10,660
Why are you not learning?

4721
03:03:10,800 --> 03:03:12,120
Oh my fucking god.

4722
03:03:13,020 --> 03:03:15,260
Doki Bird can beat anyone who doesn't learn.

4723
03:03:15,460 --> 03:03:15,980
Let's go.

4724
03:03:17,280 --> 03:03:18,000
That's it.

4725
03:03:18,980 --> 03:03:19,980
That's really it.

4726
03:03:20,580 --> 03:03:23,040
If you don't learn, I can take advantage of it.

4727
03:03:23,300 --> 03:03:25,820
He literally stood up and won!

4728
03:03:26,560 --> 03:03:28,080
I've never seen that!

4729
03:03:28,180 --> 03:03:29,680
He was on the ground!

4730
03:03:31,700 --> 03:03:32,300
Please!

4731
03:03:32,540 --> 03:03:34,240
I've done this move 20 times!

4732
03:03:34,260 --> 03:03:34,720
I think we back story here actually.

4733
03:03:34,940 --> 03:03:37,100
I think we do a couple back threes.

4734
03:03:37,880 --> 03:03:38,580
Not now.

4735
03:03:38,760 --> 03:03:39,360
Hello.

4736
03:03:40,760 --> 03:03:41,760
Is that it?

4737
03:03:44,280 --> 03:03:44,840
Is that it?

4738
03:03:45,900 --> 03:03:47,100
I wouldn't give!

4739
03:03:48,120 --> 03:03:48,740
Let's go!

4740
03:03:50,300 --> 03:03:51,860
I wouldn't give against a red!

4741
03:03:52,980 --> 03:03:53,680
Let's go!

4742
03:03:54,500 --> 03:03:55,460
Nice job!

4743
03:03:56,420 --> 03:03:57,680
I got one!

4744
03:03:57,920 --> 03:03:59,020
I got one!

4745
03:04:00,580 --> 03:04:02,240
That's what the fuck I'm talking about.

4746
03:04:04,760 --> 03:04:05,700
Good shit.

4747
03:04:05,700 --> 03:04:09,240
I'd like to dedicate this win to my coach.

4748
03:04:09,440 --> 03:04:09,840
I'd like to dedicate this win to my coach.

4749
03:04:09,860 --> 03:04:10,480
Coney.

4750
03:04:12,100 --> 03:04:13,300
Coach Coney?

4751
03:04:14,240 --> 03:04:15,480
You're welcome.

4752
03:04:16,400 --> 03:04:18,200
Hey, more alley kicks next time.

4753
03:04:18,220 --> 03:04:19,760
Yeah, thanks Coney.

4754
03:04:21,060 --> 03:04:23,120
Well, I just got cooked for no reason.

4755
03:04:23,240 --> 03:04:23,660
But what about the other one?

4756
03:04:23,680 --> 03:04:24,400
I'm not the fighter fight.

4757
03:04:24,660 --> 03:04:26,680
Some things you can teach, VP.

4758
03:04:26,940 --> 03:04:28,080
Some things you can't teach.

4759
03:04:28,380 --> 03:04:29,200
It's all intuition.

4760
03:04:30,720 --> 03:04:31,500
Look at that.

4761
03:04:31,700 --> 03:04:33,040
He must be so mad.

4762
03:04:35,040 --> 03:04:36,060
Oh, I'd be furious.

4763
03:04:37,280 --> 03:04:38,460
Let's pull up his stream.

4764
03:04:38,620 --> 03:04:40,240
Let's confirm these theories.

4765
03:04:42,380 --> 03:04:43,360
A little hypothetical.

4766
03:04:44,140 --> 03:04:45,180
Wait, who am I fighting?

4767
03:04:45,620 --> 03:04:46,580
Who are you fighting?

4768
03:04:47,000 --> 03:04:48,240
I thought I was fighting...

4769
03:04:48,240 --> 03:04:50,540
Am I fighting a Yoshi?

4770
03:04:51,300 --> 03:04:52,800
I think I'm fighting Zentreya.

4771
03:04:53,680 --> 03:04:55,880
It's just another public ass lobby for some reason.

4772
03:04:55,900 --> 03:04:56,260
Oh, I see.

4773
03:04:56,860 --> 03:04:57,820
I'm a Zentreya.

4774
03:04:58,780 --> 03:05:00,600
They should just have me make these.

4775
03:05:00,640 --> 03:05:01,780
I know I fucked up the first one.

4776
03:05:03,400 --> 03:05:04,560
That's mad annoying.

4777
03:05:04,860 --> 03:05:05,880
That's mad annoying.

4778
03:05:07,380 --> 03:05:08,320
Alright, let's get it.

4779
03:05:08,520 --> 03:05:09,420
Someone kick this guy.

4780
03:05:10,000 --> 03:05:14,000
Dude, that Brawl Pro clip where someone's calling you Hollywood.

4781
03:05:14,660 --> 03:05:17,220
And you're like, I'm not fucking Hollywood.

4782
03:05:17,480 --> 03:05:18,560
He thinks he's better than everyone.

4783
03:05:18,580 --> 03:05:19,640
No, I don't.

4784
03:05:19,640 --> 03:05:23,940
And there's like this big pause and you're like, Except Oli, I'm way better than him.

4785
03:05:23,980 --> 03:05:24,580
But that's it.

4786
03:05:25,840 --> 03:05:27,260
Dude, it's so funny.

4787
03:05:27,940 --> 03:05:29,820
Just hitting on him for no reason.

4788
03:05:30,180 --> 03:05:33,020
I live for the Brawl Pro Oli fucking beef.

4789
03:05:33,540 --> 03:05:34,060
I live for the Brawl Pro Oli fucking beef.

4790
03:05:34,060 --> 03:05:35,100
So fucking funny.

4791
03:05:35,120 --> 03:05:36,220
I fucking hate that guy, man.

4792
03:05:36,360 --> 03:05:37,820
I just saw him the other day.

4793
03:05:38,780 --> 03:05:40,480
He's like, what did you say fuck beef for?

4794
03:05:45,400 --> 03:05:46,280
Oh god.

4795
03:05:46,280 --> 03:05:48,340
I hope I'm in that man's head right now.

4796
03:05:50,100 --> 03:05:51,600
Oh, he's thinking about that L.

4797
03:05:51,620 --> 03:05:52,680
He's gonna train hard for that.

4798
03:05:52,680 --> 03:05:54,720
He's like, I got killed by a yellow?

4799
03:05:58,960 --> 03:05:59,920
June Kazama.

4800
03:06:01,460 --> 03:06:02,380
Oh my god.

4801
03:06:02,820 --> 03:06:04,880
His name is John Cena.

4802
03:06:05,120 --> 03:06:05,780
It's John Cena.

4803
03:06:05,800 --> 03:06:07,180
Yeah, I'm gonna dare you.

4804
03:06:07,840 --> 03:06:08,320
Luigi?

4805
03:06:10,020 --> 03:06:10,500
Luigi?

4806
03:06:12,300 --> 03:06:13,260
Super Luigi.

4807
03:06:14,620 --> 03:06:15,800
Luigi got a big pat.

4808
03:06:16,280 --> 03:06:18,360
I called him Luigi too during the first thing.

4809
03:06:18,360 --> 03:06:18,780
He did that.

4810
03:06:19,200 --> 03:06:22,880
I don't listen to hip hop much.

4811
03:06:22,900 --> 03:06:23,440
I don't know.

4812
03:06:27,000 --> 03:06:29,240
This is how I know you're fucking funny as shit.

4813
03:06:31,540 --> 03:06:33,620
John, my favorite character from Nintendo.

4814
03:06:33,940 --> 03:06:34,720
John Luigi.

4815
03:06:37,320 --> 03:06:39,100
Oh my, all these wakeups.

4816
03:06:39,540 --> 03:06:40,300
That's my coach.

4817
03:06:40,340 --> 03:06:40,940
Oh my lord.

4818
03:06:41,140 --> 03:06:44,460
Wakeup buttons running through your gut right now.

4819
03:06:46,360 --> 03:06:47,300
Wakeup buttons, huh?

4820
03:06:48,720 --> 03:06:49,800
Wakeup buttons, huh?

4821
03:06:50,120 --> 03:06:50,620
Okay.

4822
03:06:50,960 --> 03:06:51,920
That's fucking right.

4823
03:06:53,400 --> 03:06:55,100
Yo, that shoulder went...

4824
03:06:55,980 --> 03:06:57,240
Two times today.

4825
03:06:57,640 --> 03:06:58,940
Bro, does Zen learn?

4826
03:07:03,320 --> 03:07:03,820
Nice!

4827
03:07:04,680 --> 03:07:05,980
Yeah, cause that's low mid.

4828
03:07:06,300 --> 03:07:06,780
Okay.

4829
03:07:10,800 --> 03:07:12,520
That's supposed to be a big win, but I didn't see it.

4830
03:07:13,680 --> 03:07:14,180
Okay.

4831
03:07:18,660 --> 03:07:20,040
The fuck is that?

4832
03:07:22,820 --> 03:07:23,300
Wow.

4833
03:07:23,800 --> 03:07:24,860
Oh, nice.

4834
03:07:25,380 --> 03:07:25,420
Woo!

4835
03:07:26,280 --> 03:07:27,920
Funny might just be my go, dude.

4836
03:07:28,020 --> 03:07:29,940
Oh my goodness, brother!

4837
03:07:30,080 --> 03:07:30,560
I got it.

4838
03:07:30,580 --> 03:07:30,900
I got it.

4839
03:07:30,900 --> 03:07:32,680
Do it again!

4840
03:07:32,820 --> 03:07:33,440
Do it again!

4841
03:07:34,760 --> 03:07:36,280
It's just always wakeups, man.

4842
03:07:36,500 --> 03:07:37,360
You win.

4843
03:07:43,330 --> 03:07:44,630
I'm watching Can-Cans.

4844
03:07:45,210 --> 03:07:46,170
Round one.

4845
03:07:47,210 --> 03:07:47,690
Fight.

4846
03:07:49,410 --> 03:07:50,390
Oh my god.

4847
03:07:50,410 --> 03:07:51,490
I gotta be slow eventually.

4848
03:07:51,910 --> 03:07:52,190
Good.

4849
03:07:52,310 --> 03:07:52,450
Good.

4850
03:07:52,630 --> 03:07:52,870
Good.

4851
03:07:53,230 --> 03:07:53,710
Good.

4852
03:07:53,710 --> 03:07:53,710
Good.

4853
03:07:53,710 --> 03:07:53,710
Good.

4854
03:07:53,710 --> 03:07:53,710
Good.

4855
03:07:53,710 --> 03:07:53,710
Good.

4856
03:07:53,710 --> 03:07:53,750
Oh.

4857
03:07:54,030 --> 03:07:54,750
We're never playing.

4858
03:07:54,770 --> 03:07:56,710
And no more wake up balls.

4859
03:07:56,850 --> 03:07:58,590
I said no more wake up balls!

4860
03:07:59,530 --> 03:08:00,050
That's enough!

4861
03:08:02,470 --> 03:08:03,470
Do it again!

4862
03:08:03,470 --> 03:08:03,930
Do it again!

4863
03:08:04,430 --> 03:08:05,050
I learned it.

4864
03:08:05,050 --> 03:08:05,510
I learned it.

4865
03:08:05,570 --> 03:08:08,330
You learned it mid-match.

4866
03:08:08,350 --> 03:08:09,250
It's forever ingrained.

4867
03:08:09,750 --> 03:08:10,230
Fight.

4868
03:08:11,310 --> 03:08:11,790
What?

4869
03:08:12,530 --> 03:08:13,010
Stop!

4870
03:08:13,230 --> 03:08:13,870
What the fuck?

4871
03:08:14,150 --> 03:08:15,650
Now she's rotationing.

4872
03:08:16,110 --> 03:08:16,590
Nice.

4873
03:08:25,430 --> 03:08:27,870
No way, we're still getting up with buttons.

4874
03:08:29,330 --> 03:08:31,290
I just assume it's over.

4875
03:08:31,530 --> 03:08:32,970
You don't learn.

4876
03:08:33,510 --> 03:08:34,770
I got three of those.

4877
03:08:35,010 --> 03:08:36,350
Two very new ideas.

4878
03:08:36,530 --> 03:08:36,910
I got three.

4879
03:08:38,970 --> 03:08:40,090
Round three.

4880
03:08:41,090 --> 03:08:41,650
Fight.

4881
03:08:41,790 --> 03:08:43,590
Oh my god, you're so good.

4882
03:08:44,130 --> 03:08:45,690
This really is John Cena.

4883
03:08:46,970 --> 03:08:47,530
Fuck!

4884
03:08:47,850 --> 03:08:48,410
Yeah.

4885
03:08:50,070 --> 03:08:51,870
John Cena pre-radiate Luigi.

4886
03:08:52,310 --> 03:08:53,930
Wait, that was clean from the thing.

4887
03:08:55,130 --> 03:08:56,810
Oh, yeah that's sidestep.

4888
03:08:57,110 --> 03:08:57,750
Oh, fuck.

4889
03:08:57,870 --> 03:08:58,350
Look at you.

4890
03:08:58,450 --> 03:09:01,570
Look at my big baby boy.

4891
03:09:01,830 --> 03:09:02,350
Nice!

4892
03:09:03,790 --> 03:09:05,230
My big baby poobah.

4893
03:09:05,530 --> 03:09:06,050
That's him!

4894
03:09:08,270 --> 03:09:09,230
It's on my end.

4895
03:09:11,050 --> 03:09:11,690
It's okay.

4896
03:09:11,810 --> 03:09:13,230
You just want to keep it close.

4897
03:09:13,410 --> 03:09:13,890
Nice!

4898
03:09:14,590 --> 03:09:16,470
Oh, shit.

4899
03:09:17,750 --> 03:09:18,610
It's my turn.

4900
03:09:18,830 --> 03:09:19,430
It's still my turn.

4901
03:09:20,390 --> 03:09:20,910
Cooked.

4902
03:09:21,590 --> 03:09:22,110
Cooked.

4903
03:09:22,950 --> 03:09:24,010
Simply cooked.

4904
03:09:26,290 --> 03:09:27,150
That's our coach!

4905
03:09:29,810 --> 03:09:30,590
Yeah, whatever.

4906
03:09:30,810 --> 03:09:31,190
It's cool.

4907
03:09:33,490 --> 03:09:34,970
Yeah, don't be just do that.

4908
03:09:35,050 --> 03:09:35,590
You too, bro.

4909
03:09:35,670 --> 03:09:36,890
Yeah, you too, bro.

4910
03:09:37,870 --> 03:09:38,890
You were there too.

4911
03:09:39,950 --> 03:09:41,270
I hope you guys learned something.

4912
03:09:42,730 --> 03:09:43,890
Oh my god, I learned.

4913
03:09:43,950 --> 03:09:45,090
I'm taking notes right now.

4914
03:09:47,870 --> 03:09:49,550
Morciata, a very scary player.

4915
03:09:49,710 --> 03:09:50,510
You got this, dude.

4916
03:09:52,170 --> 03:09:52,790
Yeah, it's...

4917
03:09:54,570 --> 03:09:56,230
They play hella like...

4918
03:09:56,230 --> 03:09:57,270
I don't know how to describe it.

4919
03:09:57,310 --> 03:09:57,790
But solid.

4920
03:09:58,470 --> 03:09:58,890
Okay.

4921
03:09:59,250 --> 03:09:59,970
Real Tekken?

4922
03:10:00,570 --> 03:10:03,130
They play real Tekken, quote unquote.

4923
03:10:03,410 --> 03:10:05,410
So, maybe you want to cheese them out.

4924
03:10:05,530 --> 03:10:07,830
Wait, what does real Tekken mean?

4925
03:10:08,410 --> 03:10:09,650
He doesn't do any like...

4926
03:10:09,650 --> 03:10:10,310
weirdo moves.

4927
03:10:10,690 --> 03:10:11,930
He just kind of pokes.

4928
03:10:12,290 --> 03:10:14,090
Goes for a launcher every now and then.

4929
03:10:14,350 --> 03:10:15,290
Oh, is it Sifter?

4930
03:10:15,710 --> 03:10:16,930
So he's there to tilt you.

4931
03:10:16,930 --> 03:10:17,490
Oh, Morciata.

4932
03:10:19,690 --> 03:10:21,690
Is this Sifter's team?

4933
03:10:21,850 --> 03:10:22,150
Shifter?

4934
03:10:23,830 --> 03:10:25,910
Was it really that funny when I said Sifter?

4935
03:10:26,010 --> 03:10:27,430
You just started giggling, bro.

4936
03:10:27,790 --> 03:10:29,950
Dude, I was not the only one laughing, man.

4937
03:10:30,070 --> 03:10:32,370
Okay, but still, I think you started it.

4938
03:10:32,510 --> 03:10:33,810
That shit was silly.

4939
03:10:37,890 --> 03:10:39,010
Yeah, let's feel this out.

4940
03:10:39,150 --> 03:10:40,650
I'm not gonna be throwing out willy-nilly stuff.

4941
03:10:45,580 --> 03:10:46,260
Let's get it.

4942
03:10:47,640 --> 03:10:48,520
Round one.

4943
03:10:49,700 --> 03:10:50,140
Fight.

4944
03:10:51,300 --> 03:10:54,340
Oh, can't be eating that.

4945
03:10:54,440 --> 03:10:54,900
You're a kitchen.

4946
03:10:56,340 --> 03:10:57,220
Kitchen cousins.

4947
03:11:03,820 --> 03:11:04,260
Kitchen cousins?

4948
03:11:04,260 --> 03:11:05,200
Kitchen cousins.

4949
03:11:05,200 --> 03:11:05,640
Kitchen cousins.

4950
03:11:11,560 --> 03:11:12,740
Kitchen cousins.

4951
03:11:12,740 --> 03:11:12,920
Kitchen cousins.

4952
03:11:12,920 --> 03:11:13,540
Kitchen cousins.

4953
03:11:13,540 --> 03:11:14,400
Kitchen cousins.

4954
03:11:14,400 --> 03:11:14,600
Kitchen cousins.

4955
03:11:15,060 --> 03:11:16,400
Kitchen cousins.

4956
03:11:16,800 --> 03:11:19,080
Kitchen cousins.

4957
03:11:19,300 --> 03:11:24,400
Kitchen cousins.

4958
03:11:25,020 --> 03:11:27,080
Kitchen cousins.

4959
03:11:27,660 --> 03:11:28,980
Kitchen cousins.

4960
03:11:29,040 --> 03:11:30,320
Kitchen cousins.

4961
03:11:30,780 --> 03:11:32,060
Kitchen cousins.

4962
03:11:33,820 --> 03:11:35,340
Kitchen cousins.

4963
03:11:40,680 --> 03:11:42,740
I don't even stream, I'm a YouTuber, let me grow.

4964
03:11:44,360 --> 03:11:45,540
I'm a YouTuber too!

4965
03:11:46,200 --> 03:11:47,200
That's how you know how I feel!

4966
03:11:49,340 --> 03:11:51,420
Tech is not even your main content!

4967
03:11:51,420 --> 03:11:51,800
I'm sleepy there!

4968
03:11:53,640 --> 03:11:55,180
I'm taking a nap real quick.

4969
03:11:58,760 --> 03:11:59,980
What is happening there?

4970
03:12:01,400 --> 03:12:02,240
He's just poking.

4971
03:12:02,420 --> 03:12:05,060
Jin is so weird because he's so basic but also so crippled.

4972
03:12:05,960 --> 03:12:07,260
Wait, that's a 1 plus 2.

4973
03:12:07,840 --> 03:12:08,520
That's a 2.

4974
03:12:09,000 --> 03:12:09,720
It's a 2?

4975
03:12:10,180 --> 03:12:13,760
Oh my god, he has a main character buff, it's not fair.

4976
03:12:16,960 --> 03:12:18,080
It's okay, we cook.

4977
03:12:20,440 --> 03:12:22,240
Nice, you can wall combo here.

4978
03:12:23,640 --> 03:12:25,640
Butt too, you could still have done the butt.

4979
03:12:27,040 --> 03:12:28,800
That's alright, we get the reset, get more dubs.

4980
03:12:29,380 --> 03:12:30,360
That dude is funny!

4981
03:12:31,140 --> 03:12:32,400
That dude is funny!

4982
03:12:32,400 --> 03:12:33,120
He doesn't know how to get up.

4983
03:12:37,180 --> 03:12:38,480
Oh, come on.

4984
03:12:38,880 --> 03:12:39,400
Oh, come on.

4985
03:12:39,620 --> 03:12:40,840
You do.

4986
03:12:42,320 --> 03:12:42,920
Oh wow.

4987
03:12:43,820 --> 03:12:44,640
Nice grab.

4988
03:12:48,200 --> 03:12:48,920
Oh god.

4989
03:13:03,020 --> 03:13:06,140
I've never seen this kick that I'm getting hit with in my whole fucking life.

4990
03:13:06,500 --> 03:13:10,120
That's a badass, across the map, counter hit launcher.

4991
03:13:10,800 --> 03:13:11,320
Fuck.

4992
03:13:12,460 --> 03:13:13,760
Show me your moves now.

4993
03:13:13,780 --> 03:13:14,160
So I'm getting hit with like a 5x5 unit.

4994
03:13:14,640 --> 03:13:15,780
Like the third move.

4995
03:13:16,840 --> 03:13:17,600
What is that?

4996
03:13:17,660 --> 03:13:19,480
Like he's hitting me with two hits and then that kick.

4997
03:13:19,900 --> 03:13:21,360
Oh, you mean the downward kick?

4998
03:13:22,120 --> 03:13:24,720
No, that kick that just like counter hits me.

4999
03:13:25,120 --> 03:13:25,520
Oh.

5000
03:13:25,980 --> 03:13:28,840
That's a move on its own, it's his forward 4.

5001
03:13:29,500 --> 03:13:30,860
Yeah, it's a solo move.

5002
03:13:31,020 --> 03:13:32,360
It's just a counter hit launcher, full screen.

5003
03:13:33,260 --> 03:13:34,060
Yeah, um...

5004
03:13:34,660 --> 03:13:39,640
You can power crush it or you can whiff punish it, but it's a really good move, yeah.

5005
03:13:43,940 --> 03:13:45,440
He just pushes you off.

5006
03:13:45,660 --> 03:13:46,040
I'm tired.

5007
03:13:47,140 --> 03:13:47,860
I'm tired.

5008
03:13:47,900 --> 03:13:48,640
Oh, what a turn.

5009
03:13:54,210 --> 03:13:54,770
It's okay.

5010
03:13:55,510 --> 03:13:56,430
Got the advantage.

5011
03:13:57,690 --> 03:13:58,430
Oh my god.

5012
03:14:02,250 --> 03:14:03,710
He likes having no keys.

5013
03:14:09,090 --> 03:14:10,890
I don't have any fucking strings.

5014
03:14:17,910 --> 03:14:18,590
Slap him!

5015
03:14:18,690 --> 03:14:18,830
Slap him!

5016
03:14:18,830 --> 03:14:18,830
Oh.

5017
03:14:21,370 --> 03:14:22,110
Slap him.

5018
03:14:22,210 --> 03:14:22,410
Yeah.

5019
03:14:36,080 --> 03:14:37,220
Nice running.

5020
03:14:37,960 --> 03:14:38,780
Oh, nice.

5021
03:14:41,400 --> 03:14:42,780
Oh my god, nom.

5022
03:14:42,800 --> 03:14:43,400
Oh, nice.

5023
03:14:46,180 --> 03:14:46,780
Oh!

5024
03:14:52,260 --> 03:14:52,860
Nice.

5025
03:14:53,320 --> 03:14:54,360
Holy shit.

5026
03:14:55,180 --> 03:14:56,080
Holy shit.

5027
03:14:56,080 --> 03:14:57,780
Three... fight.

5028
03:14:59,960 --> 03:15:01,040
Come on.

5029
03:15:07,900 --> 03:15:08,340
Come on.

5030
03:15:08,740 --> 03:15:09,500
Two...

5031
03:15:10,400 --> 03:15:11,160
Six...

5032
03:15:12,060 --> 03:15:12,480
Two...

5033
03:15:12,480 --> 03:15:13,840
Two...

5034
03:15:15,200 --> 03:15:15,960
Two...

5035
03:15:18,760 --> 03:15:20,640
He's only grabbing with the two grab.

5036
03:15:20,760 --> 03:15:20,940
Yeah.

5037
03:15:22,320 --> 03:15:23,080
Fight.

5038
03:15:28,380 --> 03:15:29,420
What a...

5039
03:15:29,420 --> 03:15:29,960
Oh!

5040
03:15:37,930 --> 03:15:38,250
Oh!

5041
03:15:39,570 --> 03:15:39,890
Nice.

5042
03:15:43,890 --> 03:15:43,930
Nice.

5043
03:15:44,850 --> 03:15:45,170
Nice.

5044
03:15:45,170 --> 03:15:46,470
Why am I getting fucking turned around?

5045
03:15:46,550 --> 03:15:47,230
I don't know what to do.

5046
03:15:47,550 --> 03:15:50,290
You press 1 plus 2, that's why he does that.

5047
03:15:50,570 --> 03:15:50,730
You press 1 plus 2, that's why he does that.

5048
03:15:53,010 --> 03:15:53,790
Oh, he didn't let go.

5049
03:15:58,150 --> 03:15:58,750
You hit it?

5050
03:15:58,910 --> 03:15:59,050
You hit it?

5051
03:15:59,610 --> 03:15:59,930
Yeah!

5052
03:16:00,070 --> 03:16:01,050
Oh my god.

5053
03:16:01,890 --> 03:16:02,270
Wow!

5054
03:16:03,030 --> 03:16:05,190
Maybe you can hit and then cancel it?

5055
03:16:05,330 --> 03:16:05,910
And then fish?

5056
03:16:06,070 --> 03:16:07,330
I don't know, but the wall is right there.

5057
03:16:07,610 --> 03:16:08,450
Yeah, I'll give it a shot.

5058
03:16:09,550 --> 03:16:09,930
Okay.

5059
03:16:10,890 --> 03:16:12,010
Yes, sir.

5060
03:16:12,050 --> 03:16:12,190
Okay.

5061
03:16:14,150 --> 03:16:15,030
Yours comes out first.

5062
03:16:16,110 --> 03:16:16,490
No.

5063
03:16:17,250 --> 03:16:17,630
Oh!

5064
03:16:18,330 --> 03:16:18,990
That's safe?

5065
03:16:20,630 --> 03:16:21,610
Yeah, that's really solid.

5066
03:16:21,730 --> 03:16:22,230
That's close.

5067
03:16:22,990 --> 03:16:25,550
Oh my god, I hate that fucking character so much.

5068
03:16:25,810 --> 03:16:27,130
So can you download him?

5069
03:16:27,750 --> 03:16:30,330
We got hella info on this guy.

5070
03:16:30,430 --> 03:16:30,630
Yeah.

5071
03:16:31,710 --> 03:16:36,910
Yeah, Jin is so weird, cause he's not like, spamming, like warring or whatever, but he still feels so like...

5072
03:16:37,550 --> 03:16:38,230
I don't know.

5073
03:16:38,390 --> 03:16:39,070
It's just moves.

5074
03:16:39,290 --> 03:16:39,870
I don't know how to play.

5075
03:16:39,870 --> 03:16:40,510
Oh yeah, he's good.

5076
03:16:40,570 --> 03:16:41,490
He has really good buttons.

5077
03:16:41,550 --> 03:16:41,910
For sure.

5078
03:16:42,550 --> 03:16:42,910
100%.

5079
03:16:44,930 --> 03:16:45,650
Oh man.

5080
03:16:45,650 --> 03:16:46,650
Whose team is this?

5081
03:16:46,810 --> 03:16:47,890
Oh, this is Miles' team.

5082
03:16:47,970 --> 03:16:48,130
Okay.

5083
03:16:48,510 --> 03:16:50,150
I've never fought this guy in my life.

5084
03:16:51,010 --> 03:16:52,710
He probably makes them very fast.

5085
03:16:53,130 --> 03:16:55,550
I have no data on this guy.

5086
03:16:55,690 --> 03:16:56,270
Please leave.

5087
03:16:56,650 --> 03:16:58,550
You said that from FD.

5088
03:16:58,550 --> 03:16:59,750
Yeah, you said that from Eddie.

5089
03:17:00,450 --> 03:17:01,930
Yeah, but this guy was in a boxbox.

5090
03:17:02,430 --> 03:17:03,330
This one's a little different.

5091
03:17:03,570 --> 03:17:04,750
Yeah, I can hear you.

5092
03:17:04,750 --> 03:17:05,270
No, we heard you.

5093
03:17:05,350 --> 03:17:05,650
We heard you.

5094
03:17:06,150 --> 03:17:07,130
Yeah, sorry, sorry, sorry.

5095
03:17:11,540 --> 03:17:13,220
Who came up with Jack Jesus?

5096
03:17:13,320 --> 03:17:14,580
Was it just someone's chat?

5097
03:17:14,600 --> 03:17:15,480
I think it was Dayjam.

5098
03:17:15,960 --> 03:17:16,900
I have no idea.

5099
03:17:17,320 --> 03:17:18,200
Might have been a chat.

5100
03:17:18,400 --> 03:17:19,980
Might have been... Why did he even say that?

5101
03:17:20,060 --> 03:17:21,280
You don't... I don't know.

5102
03:17:21,400 --> 03:17:24,140
He literally said, they call him Jack Jesus.

5103
03:17:24,280 --> 03:17:24,880
Whose day?

5104
03:17:26,260 --> 03:17:27,380
Yeah, who is that?

5105
03:17:28,380 --> 03:17:29,300
Well, now they do.

5106
03:17:29,300 --> 03:17:31,500
He implanted the shit.

5107
03:17:31,660 --> 03:17:32,900
Yeah, I've never fought this guy.

5108
03:17:32,960 --> 03:17:33,160
We'll try.

5109
03:17:34,200 --> 03:17:35,240
Have you fought Alyssa?

5110
03:17:35,880 --> 03:17:37,100
A little bit.

5111
03:17:37,200 --> 03:17:37,960
I kinda know.

5112
03:17:38,880 --> 03:17:39,460
Not really.

5113
03:17:40,360 --> 03:17:40,900
We'll see.

5114
03:17:41,040 --> 03:17:41,480
What the hell?

5115
03:17:43,000 --> 03:17:44,200
She can't see!

5116
03:17:44,440 --> 03:17:45,040
What the heck?

5117
03:17:45,300 --> 03:17:45,780
Wait!

5118
03:17:45,780 --> 03:17:46,680
No, I'm behind!

5119
03:17:47,380 --> 03:17:48,800
Oh, what the fuck?

5120
03:17:50,460 --> 03:17:51,400
That's an SCP.

5121
03:17:51,640 --> 03:17:52,180
She's scary.

5122
03:17:52,520 --> 03:17:54,900
Oh my god, what's going on with my game?

5123
03:17:55,520 --> 03:17:56,000
Woo!

5124
03:17:56,380 --> 03:17:56,860
My speed.

5125
03:17:59,300 --> 03:18:01,340
Spectator bugged so hard, I went zoom.

5126
03:18:02,840 --> 03:18:04,780
Yeah, it's so goofy when that happens.

5127
03:18:05,440 --> 03:18:05,880
Volcano!

5128
03:18:06,260 --> 03:18:06,600
Volcano!

5129
03:18:06,620 --> 03:18:07,060
Nice!

5130
03:18:07,600 --> 03:18:08,520
Oh, nice!

5131
03:18:10,400 --> 03:18:11,820
Oh, you see how he got up wrong there?

5132
03:18:13,820 --> 03:18:15,500
Yeah, that's the inner formation.

5133
03:18:15,860 --> 03:18:16,860
And you were scared!

5134
03:18:18,380 --> 03:18:19,300
You got up wrong!

5135
03:18:20,020 --> 03:18:21,000
You got up wrong!

5136
03:18:21,540 --> 03:18:22,440
Oh my god.

5137
03:18:23,660 --> 03:18:24,940
Oh, he's getting up wrong.

5138
03:18:25,000 --> 03:18:25,900
He's getting looped with it.

5139
03:18:27,100 --> 03:18:28,560
Plague up correctly, bro!

5140
03:18:29,720 --> 03:18:31,240
Whoops, whoops, whoops, whoops, whoops, whoops, whoops.

5141
03:18:31,240 --> 03:18:32,060
I'm never gonna chill.

5142
03:18:33,820 --> 03:18:34,500
Alright, bro.

5143
03:18:35,260 --> 03:18:36,200
I love this character.

5144
03:18:36,380 --> 03:18:36,920
So fun.

5145
03:18:39,680 --> 03:18:40,160
Nice.

5146
03:18:40,580 --> 03:18:41,300
Oh, bound!

5147
03:18:42,780 --> 03:18:43,260
Yo!

5148
03:18:43,620 --> 03:18:44,740
The side wall maybe.

5149
03:18:45,020 --> 03:18:47,040
Oh, that side step!

5150
03:18:49,400 --> 03:18:51,800
Yeah, we have to recognize side wall.

5151
03:18:52,040 --> 03:18:52,900
You know what I mean.

5152
03:18:53,260 --> 03:18:53,980
Epic, dude.

5153
03:18:55,840 --> 03:18:56,320
What?

5154
03:18:59,260 --> 03:19:01,780
Yeah, get her out of that.

5155
03:19:02,880 --> 03:19:04,580
I can't believe that works.

5156
03:19:04,820 --> 03:19:06,060
That always works!

5157
03:19:06,760 --> 03:19:07,620
They'll never learn.

5158
03:19:07,800 --> 03:19:08,720
This team doesn't learn.

5159
03:19:09,140 --> 03:19:09,160
Oh, fuck!

5160
03:19:12,680 --> 03:19:13,920
No, 1 plus 2.

5161
03:19:14,740 --> 03:19:15,600
1 plus 2.

5162
03:19:16,580 --> 03:19:17,020
Oh.

5163
03:19:18,660 --> 03:19:19,100
Nice.

5164
03:19:19,100 --> 03:19:20,160
Drop the satellite.

5165
03:19:21,520 --> 03:19:21,960
Punish?

5166
03:19:22,020 --> 03:19:22,660
Ah, sorry.

5167
03:19:22,880 --> 03:19:23,860
I didn't know it was punishable.

5168
03:19:23,900 --> 03:19:24,120
Okay.

5169
03:19:24,120 --> 03:19:25,880
Oh, it hits still.

5170
03:19:26,140 --> 03:19:27,200
Oh, is that?

5171
03:19:27,660 --> 03:19:28,560
Oh, god.

5172
03:19:28,880 --> 03:19:30,120
Now you know why I was confused.

5173
03:19:31,740 --> 03:19:34,380
I can tell that Kony is way behind.

5174
03:19:34,900 --> 03:19:36,020
I'm very behind.

5175
03:19:36,100 --> 03:19:37,480
You know, the biggest mistake?

5176
03:19:37,680 --> 03:19:38,940
I gotta restart this PC.

5177
03:19:40,580 --> 03:19:44,780
You dropped the satellite and we're like 4 seconds ahead of you.

5178
03:19:45,740 --> 03:19:47,520
I'm watching like a John Woo film.

5179
03:19:48,360 --> 03:19:50,120
Oh, you get your HP back.

5180
03:19:50,460 --> 03:19:50,920
I know, right?

5181
03:19:51,020 --> 03:19:51,820
It's a hard counter now.

5182
03:19:51,900 --> 03:19:52,300
Genuinely.

5183
03:19:52,680 --> 03:19:53,940
It's good to armor, Alyssa.

5184
03:19:54,900 --> 03:19:56,340
I forgot about that.

5185
03:19:57,420 --> 03:19:58,380
Oh, fuck.

5186
03:19:58,440 --> 03:19:59,480
This is close, man.

5187
03:19:59,600 --> 03:20:00,200
I don't know what this is.

5188
03:20:00,300 --> 03:20:01,360
Damn, this guy is pretty good.

5189
03:20:01,740 --> 03:20:03,300
He hit confirm that too.

5190
03:20:03,440 --> 03:20:04,060
That was nice.

5191
03:20:05,700 --> 03:20:06,180
Woo!

5192
03:20:07,940 --> 03:20:09,380
A lot of chip too.

5193
03:20:17,760 --> 03:20:18,520
Oh, fuck.

5194
03:20:18,620 --> 03:20:20,420
Oh, no.

5195
03:20:20,620 --> 03:20:21,960
She downloaded you.

5196
03:20:23,740 --> 03:20:24,580
Oh, my.

5197
03:20:24,960 --> 03:20:25,440
Okay.

5198
03:20:27,040 --> 03:20:27,520
Nice.

5199
03:20:27,600 --> 03:20:29,900
I'm gonna go back to the game.

5200
03:20:30,740 --> 03:20:32,280
It's a lot of HP back.

5201
03:20:32,440 --> 03:20:32,800
Fuck.

5202
03:20:34,040 --> 03:20:34,900
Okay, understood.

5203
03:20:35,160 --> 03:20:36,560
I can fix this.

5204
03:20:36,760 --> 03:20:37,220
You win.

5205
03:20:37,760 --> 03:20:38,380
It's okay.

5206
03:20:38,520 --> 03:20:39,440
You can download her back.

5207
03:20:39,440 --> 03:20:40,040
Is that hopkick?

5208
03:20:40,380 --> 03:20:41,340
Is that hopkick?

5209
03:20:41,440 --> 03:20:42,020
How punishable?

5210
03:20:42,280 --> 03:20:42,760
13?

5211
03:20:42,880 --> 03:20:43,380
Minus 13.

5212
03:20:43,880 --> 03:20:44,360
Okay.

5213
03:20:44,480 --> 03:20:44,960
Yeah.

5214
03:20:45,200 --> 03:20:48,220
So you have a shoulder or you can do your 2-3 thing.

5215
03:20:48,400 --> 03:20:50,460
You just can't forward 1-1, I think.

5216
03:20:50,940 --> 03:20:51,420
Okay.

5217
03:20:51,900 --> 03:20:52,380
Okay.

5218
03:20:52,740 --> 03:20:54,700
Is it 0-1 or 1-1?

5219
03:20:55,120 --> 03:20:56,300
0-1.

5220
03:20:56,300 --> 03:20:56,800
Okay.

5221
03:20:56,940 --> 03:20:57,280
Yeah.

5222
03:20:57,360 --> 03:20:58,360
Yeah, you can 1-1.

5223
03:20:58,460 --> 03:20:59,020
Yeah, 1-1.

5224
03:20:59,080 --> 03:20:59,300
Awesome.

5225
03:21:02,160 --> 03:21:02,560
Fuck.

5226
03:21:02,860 --> 03:21:03,820
She gets up wrong.

5227
03:21:03,940 --> 03:21:04,360
Oh, yeah.

5228
03:21:04,480 --> 03:21:05,140
It's hard to do.

5229
03:21:14,020 --> 03:21:15,640
I think I need a 2-jab more.

5230
03:21:18,200 --> 03:21:19,620
I'm gonna try to see if it works.

5231
03:21:21,580 --> 03:21:23,040
Oh, my lord.

5232
03:21:23,180 --> 03:21:23,920
The HP.

5233
03:21:24,420 --> 03:21:25,180
That's insane.

5234
03:21:25,340 --> 03:21:25,840
Oh, my god.

5235
03:21:25,940 --> 03:21:26,840
She's so dead.

5236
03:21:27,080 --> 03:21:28,420
You get so much health back.

5237
03:21:29,700 --> 03:21:30,280
That's absurd.

5238
03:21:33,700 --> 03:21:34,460
Nice step.

5239
03:21:35,300 --> 03:21:36,060
Yeah, that was good.

5240
03:21:42,420 --> 03:21:43,060
Oh, shit.

5241
03:21:43,080 --> 03:21:43,720
That's launch, huh?

5242
03:21:43,840 --> 03:21:44,480
If I duck it?

5243
03:21:44,480 --> 03:21:45,480
You have to stay ducking.

5244
03:21:45,500 --> 03:21:45,720
Yes.

5245
03:21:45,880 --> 03:21:46,840
You have to stay ducking.

5246
03:21:47,440 --> 03:21:48,140
Low-high.

5247
03:21:48,240 --> 03:21:48,780
It jails though.

5248
03:21:50,580 --> 03:21:52,720
What if I duck the...

5249
03:21:52,720 --> 03:21:53,800
or I get hit by the high?

5250
03:21:53,840 --> 03:21:54,060
What happens?

5251
03:21:55,960 --> 03:21:56,720
Is it like...

5252
03:21:56,720 --> 03:21:57,960
You know the frames on it?

5253
03:21:59,320 --> 03:22:02,220
I don't know the frames, but it's like neutral-ish.

5254
03:22:02,500 --> 03:22:03,520
Oh, it's clean.

5255
03:22:03,760 --> 03:22:04,160
Yeah!

5256
03:22:07,200 --> 03:22:08,120
Yeah, it is neutral.

5257
03:22:08,240 --> 03:22:09,700
It is neutral, but it does chip damage.

5258
03:22:10,560 --> 03:22:11,500
I don't know what to do here.

5259
03:22:11,580 --> 03:22:12,740
He's gonna do some random-ass shit.

5260
03:22:13,160 --> 03:22:14,120
You're gonna run up and blog.

5261
03:22:17,840 --> 03:22:18,200
Punish.

5262
03:22:18,260 --> 03:22:18,980
Nice punish!

5263
03:22:19,520 --> 03:22:20,120
Oh, fuck!

5264
03:22:21,360 --> 03:22:22,080
Ah, bitch!

5265
03:22:23,000 --> 03:22:23,360
Wow!

5266
03:22:25,700 --> 03:22:26,740
We take that.

5267
03:22:27,460 --> 03:22:27,940
We take it.

5268
03:22:28,120 --> 03:22:28,540
We love that.

5269
03:22:28,760 --> 03:22:29,100
Yeah, yeah.

5270
03:22:29,120 --> 03:22:29,420
Your head!

5271
03:22:29,500 --> 03:22:29,860
Your head!

5272
03:22:35,260 --> 03:22:35,980
So crazy.

5273
03:22:35,980 --> 03:22:37,140
Oh my god.

5274
03:22:39,480 --> 03:22:40,140
Oh!

5275
03:22:40,520 --> 03:22:41,280
Break it.

5276
03:22:43,060 --> 03:22:43,720
Yes!

5277
03:22:44,080 --> 03:22:44,300
Yes!

5278
03:22:46,040 --> 03:22:47,560
Oh my god, don't let her get up!

5279
03:22:47,960 --> 03:22:49,540
This character is fucking insane.

5280
03:22:50,060 --> 03:22:51,340
I know, right?

5281
03:22:51,440 --> 03:22:53,300
What the fuck is that?

5282
03:22:53,900 --> 03:22:54,380
Oh my god.

5283
03:22:55,580 --> 03:22:57,240
He's just inventing moves.

5284
03:22:57,340 --> 03:22:58,100
This is unbelievable.

5285
03:22:58,800 --> 03:22:59,900
You downloaded her back!

5286
03:23:03,500 --> 03:23:08,200
Every time Jack is on screen, the screen is shaking!

5287
03:23:08,580 --> 03:23:09,520
I'm getting dizzy.

5288
03:23:10,600 --> 03:23:11,500
Oh my god.

5289
03:23:11,540 --> 03:23:12,460
The dizzy meter.

5290
03:23:12,620 --> 03:23:15,180
Eddie's dizzy meter was so stupid.

5291
03:23:15,180 --> 03:23:15,920
I got you, dude.

5292
03:23:17,700 --> 03:23:19,060
Mat, you can duck her one-one.

5293
03:23:19,860 --> 03:23:20,800
Oh, my!

5294
03:23:20,920 --> 03:23:21,260
Nice!

5295
03:23:24,140 --> 03:23:24,740
Oh!

5296
03:23:26,800 --> 03:23:27,400
Oh!

5297
03:23:42,910 --> 03:23:45,110
Oh wow the counter hit you dead.

5298
03:23:45,370 --> 03:23:46,390
Oh my gosh nice.

5299
03:23:46,830 --> 03:23:47,410
Nice!

5300
03:23:48,010 --> 03:23:48,990
First win.

5301
03:23:49,450 --> 03:23:50,410
Good shit.

5302
03:23:55,370 --> 03:23:57,770
What the fuck was that roll man?

5303
03:24:03,400 --> 03:24:04,180
What is this?

5304
03:24:04,220 --> 03:24:04,680
Okay man!

5305
03:24:07,780 --> 03:24:08,580
That's what you do!

5306
03:24:08,720 --> 03:24:09,120
That's you!

5307
03:24:09,400 --> 03:24:10,300
That's what you do to people!

5308
03:24:10,560 --> 03:24:11,080
Get back to her!

5309
03:24:11,080 --> 03:24:11,960
I'll get it I'll get it I'll get it.

5310
03:24:13,240 --> 03:24:14,360
Look what you're doing!

5311
03:24:14,720 --> 03:24:15,460
Look at you!

5312
03:24:16,080 --> 03:24:16,760
I'm going.

5313
03:24:18,060 --> 03:24:18,720
Did you hit that?

5314
03:24:18,860 --> 03:24:19,500
Oh big.

5315
03:24:19,660 --> 03:24:20,000
Yeah!

5316
03:24:21,080 --> 03:24:21,800
That's free right?

5317
03:24:21,860 --> 03:24:22,380
She can't get upstairs.

5318
03:24:23,080 --> 03:24:23,860
What's the mix?

5319
03:24:24,380 --> 03:24:26,460
Ah he might rage art if you run up into nothing.

5320
03:24:26,680 --> 03:24:27,740
Maybe run up into nothing.

5321
03:24:30,180 --> 03:24:31,660
And then the heat dash mix.

5322
03:24:33,940 --> 03:24:34,540
What a fuck.

5323
03:24:34,580 --> 03:24:34,660
Oh my god.

5324
03:24:34,680 --> 03:24:35,340
Oh nice!

5325
03:24:35,980 --> 03:24:36,580
That was cute.

5326
03:24:36,900 --> 03:24:38,160
You got cute with it.

5327
03:24:38,240 --> 03:24:39,120
I like that.

5328
03:24:41,620 --> 03:24:47,830
I think he's going to go low at the walls and then I'm just going to try and get the back.

5329
03:24:47,830 --> 03:24:49,110
Down 4 1 plus 2 maybe?

5330
03:24:49,350 --> 03:24:49,950
Oh fuck.

5331
03:24:51,630 --> 03:24:52,350
Oh wow.

5332
03:24:52,810 --> 03:24:54,490
Well we didn't guess right there.

5333
03:24:55,910 --> 03:24:56,850
We all died.

5334
03:24:57,810 --> 03:24:58,670
Team every.

5335
03:24:58,950 --> 03:24:59,910
Team every.

5336
03:25:00,930 --> 03:25:01,410
Nice.

5337
03:25:02,730 --> 03:25:03,210
Okay.

5338
03:25:04,850 --> 03:25:05,810
Pretty good.

5339
03:25:06,150 --> 03:25:06,630
Fight!

5340
03:25:06,730 --> 03:25:06,990
Oh my god.

5341
03:25:07,930 --> 03:25:08,370
Oh my god.

5342
03:25:12,630 --> 03:25:14,130
Oh I can't believe she died.

5343
03:25:14,130 --> 03:25:14,530
No way!

5344
03:25:15,390 --> 03:25:16,370
Oh my gosh no.

5345
03:25:18,750 --> 03:25:19,890
She should die there.

5346
03:25:21,410 --> 03:25:22,070
Yeah right.

5347
03:25:22,250 --> 03:25:22,830
The head's off.

5348
03:25:23,190 --> 03:25:23,510
Yeah.

5349
03:25:24,310 --> 03:25:25,010
That's her head.

5350
03:25:25,090 --> 03:25:25,550
Come on man.

5351
03:25:28,730 --> 03:25:29,890
Oh my god.

5352
03:25:30,050 --> 03:25:30,550
Okay I'll try.

5353
03:25:31,110 --> 03:25:31,550
Alright.

5354
03:25:31,910 --> 03:25:32,350
Alright.

5355
03:25:32,390 --> 03:25:33,630
It's like a self destruct.

5356
03:25:33,710 --> 03:25:34,250
Lock in.

5357
03:25:34,250 --> 03:25:34,450
Lock in.

5358
03:25:34,450 --> 03:25:34,610
Lock in.

5359
03:25:34,770 --> 03:25:34,890
Lock in.

5360
03:25:34,890 --> 03:25:35,110
Lock in.

5361
03:25:38,410 --> 03:25:39,590
Oh no blue spark.

5362
03:25:40,290 --> 03:25:41,430
Oh so no combo?

5363
03:25:42,350 --> 03:25:42,910
No.

5364
03:25:43,010 --> 03:25:43,450
It's okay.

5365
03:25:45,630 --> 03:25:47,650
Oh what a back step.

5366
03:25:55,120 --> 03:25:55,820
Nice bro.

5367
03:25:55,920 --> 03:25:56,400
Nice!

5368
03:25:56,480 --> 03:25:57,040
Nice!

5369
03:25:57,940 --> 03:25:58,380
Oh shit.

5370
03:26:01,480 --> 03:26:02,380
Oh nice.

5371
03:26:02,660 --> 03:26:03,320
Get out of here bro.

5372
03:26:03,400 --> 03:26:04,060
That's right!

5373
03:26:04,400 --> 03:26:05,440
There he goes!

5374
03:26:06,100 --> 03:26:07,080
Let's fucking go.

5375
03:26:07,080 --> 03:26:08,260
Fun fucking shit dude.

5376
03:26:08,360 --> 03:26:09,440
Let's fucking go.

5377
03:26:09,700 --> 03:26:10,400
He's the end.

5378
03:26:10,420 --> 03:26:10,900
He's the anchor man.

5379
03:26:11,340 --> 03:26:12,200
He's the anchor.

5380
03:26:12,920 --> 03:26:13,360
Dude.

5381
03:26:13,600 --> 03:26:13,820
Dude.

5382
03:26:13,820 --> 03:26:14,420
A trump card.

5383
03:26:15,120 --> 03:26:15,560
Dude.

5384
03:26:15,560 --> 03:26:23,540
Defending and muting is not a good idea during these sets because dude I think it's good like the down how you duck that string and launch them for it.

5385
03:26:23,640 --> 03:26:24,140
That was good.

5386
03:26:24,240 --> 03:26:25,320
I mean it made sense with low high.

5387
03:26:25,540 --> 03:26:26,380
Good shit bro.

5388
03:26:26,480 --> 03:26:26,580
Yeah.

5389
03:26:26,940 --> 03:26:27,940
Good shit.

5390
03:26:28,140 --> 03:26:29,820
Okay brawpos gotta bring it back.

5391
03:26:29,900 --> 03:26:31,020
Bring back all the king wins.

5392
03:26:31,180 --> 03:26:31,540
Oh fuck I have to play?

5393
03:26:31,720 --> 03:26:32,660
Why do I have to play again?

5394
03:26:32,920 --> 03:26:33,160
Fuck.

5395
03:26:34,500 --> 03:26:35,780
Yeah keep the king streak.

5396
03:26:36,020 --> 03:26:36,640
Get us more points coach.

5397
03:26:36,720 --> 03:26:37,980
Go get us more points.

5398
03:26:38,080 --> 03:26:38,360
Yeah.

5399
03:26:39,200 --> 03:26:40,240
No no it's it's.

5400
03:26:40,320 --> 03:26:40,400
It's a good idea.

5401
03:26:40,420 --> 03:26:41,120
I mean we lost 3-1 right?

5402
03:26:41,160 --> 03:26:41,500
Thanks chat.

5403
03:26:41,640 --> 03:26:42,340
We lost 3-1.

5404
03:26:43,020 --> 03:26:46,740
Yeah but if he loses this he's like the weakest king player out of all of us.

5405
03:26:47,220 --> 03:26:48,000
That is true.

5406
03:26:48,000 --> 03:26:49,040
Cause all the other kings won their match.

5407
03:26:49,060 --> 03:26:49,320
That's actually true.

5408
03:26:49,520 --> 03:26:49,900
Yeah.

5409
03:26:49,920 --> 03:26:50,780
That's interesting.

5410
03:26:53,220 --> 03:26:54,820
Didn't think of it like that.

5411
03:26:56,420 --> 03:26:57,160
Some coach.

5412
03:26:57,200 --> 03:26:58,220
Dude she's good bro.

5413
03:26:58,320 --> 03:26:59,680
What do you want me to do?

5414
03:27:00,700 --> 03:27:03,820
I just want you not to get sunned by Kony and Doki.

5415
03:27:04,200 --> 03:27:04,640
Yeah.

5416
03:27:04,820 --> 03:27:05,600
Come on.

5417
03:27:05,740 --> 03:27:06,780
That's your job.

5418
03:27:08,000 --> 03:27:09,760
You can't just break the king streak.

5419
03:27:09,960 --> 03:27:10,400
I'm just gonna go get some points.

5420
03:27:11,980 --> 03:27:12,780
You wanted to get said- I'd be the hell out of this pile.

5421
03:27:12,780 --> 03:27:15,160
This is a lot of added pressure that I don't need here.

5422
03:27:15,540 --> 03:27:16,660
We just came for secret rankings.

5423
03:27:16,800 --> 03:27:18,480
We're prepping you for the finals!

5424
03:27:19,440 --> 03:27:21,500
We're prepping you for the fin- for the finals!

5425
03:27:24,600 --> 03:27:26,360
Press one if you won your set.

5426
03:27:26,660 --> 03:27:27,100
One.

5427
03:27:27,280 --> 03:27:28,580
Press one if you won your set.

5428
03:27:28,940 --> 03:27:29,380
One.

5429
03:27:29,380 --> 03:27:30,660
I didn't even lose ya bro.

5430
03:27:33,780 --> 03:27:35,160
Earn that one bro.

5431
03:27:35,200 --> 03:27:35,740
Earn that one.

5432
03:27:35,940 --> 03:27:36,000
One.

5433
03:27:37,100 --> 03:27:37,540
Fight.

5434
03:27:39,060 --> 03:27:42,130
Just kick him off?

5435
03:27:42,210 --> 03:27:42,510
No.

5436
03:27:42,530 --> 03:27:42,730
Oh.

5437
03:27:47,440 --> 03:27:47,960
Foggy.

5438
03:27:48,480 --> 03:27:50,020
We got all the blocks.

5439
03:27:52,020 --> 03:27:52,880
Oh, nice!

5440
03:28:01,200 --> 03:28:02,340
That's a lot of neutral.

5441
03:28:02,680 --> 03:28:03,200
Yeah.

5442
03:28:07,950 --> 03:28:09,790
He does not lose.

5443
03:28:12,550 --> 03:28:13,530
Oh, let's go.

5444
03:28:14,390 --> 03:28:15,690
She has to break those.

5445
03:28:15,710 --> 03:28:17,250
If she's not breaking those, then...

5446
03:28:17,250 --> 03:28:17,850
Yeah.

5447
03:28:18,370 --> 03:28:19,450
That's all me, baby.

5448
03:28:19,610 --> 03:28:19,930
Swing!

5449
03:28:20,230 --> 03:28:21,330
Swing that goal!

5450
03:28:21,910 --> 03:28:22,830
Five more.

5451
03:28:23,330 --> 03:28:24,010
Let's go.

5452
03:28:24,610 --> 03:28:25,890
Keep that streak.

5453
03:28:31,310 --> 03:28:32,190
Good shot.

5454
03:28:33,390 --> 03:28:33,990
Oh.

5455
03:28:34,350 --> 03:28:34,950
Nice.

5456
03:28:37,530 --> 03:28:38,850
Yeah, bro is sleeping.

5457
03:28:46,180 --> 03:28:47,020
Good shot.

5458
03:28:47,280 --> 03:28:48,160
Oh, she broke two.

5459
03:28:49,220 --> 03:28:50,720
I'll be able to do that too.

5460
03:28:57,880 --> 03:28:58,220
Oh, nice.

5461
03:28:59,040 --> 03:28:59,600
Really?

5462
03:29:00,680 --> 03:29:01,620
Even more?

5463
03:29:02,620 --> 03:29:03,820
What the fuck?

5464
03:29:09,400 --> 03:29:09,960
Nice.

5465
03:29:10,480 --> 03:29:12,400
That's... right there.

5466
03:29:17,890 --> 03:29:19,770
I love that shove move from King.

5467
03:29:19,950 --> 03:29:20,470
Yeah.

5468
03:29:20,590 --> 03:29:25,410
It's like a high school, like, back of the high school near the flagpole move.

5469
03:29:25,670 --> 03:29:26,790
Oh, rotated!

5470
03:29:27,750 --> 03:29:28,750
Get rotated.

5471
03:29:29,150 --> 03:29:32,650
That move is so good and I never use it.

5472
03:29:32,650 --> 03:29:34,890
It basically just puts you in plus.

5473
03:29:35,470 --> 03:29:36,530
Just up close.

5474
03:29:36,650 --> 03:29:37,190
It's so good.

5475
03:29:38,010 --> 03:29:38,550
Wow.

5476
03:29:38,770 --> 03:29:39,410
I mean, what a walk.

5477
03:29:39,430 --> 03:29:39,970
Nice!

5478
03:29:40,110 --> 03:29:40,590
Whoa!

5479
03:29:40,730 --> 03:29:41,330
What a duck!

5480
03:29:41,570 --> 03:29:41,630
Hey.

5481
03:29:42,690 --> 03:29:43,230
Cup!

5482
03:29:43,510 --> 03:29:44,690
Oh, my God!

5483
03:29:45,230 --> 03:29:45,770
See?

5484
03:29:45,770 --> 03:29:47,810
The added pressure makes you a better player.

5485
03:29:48,350 --> 03:29:49,230
He's stronger!

5486
03:29:49,530 --> 03:29:49,830
Yeah!

5487
03:29:49,890 --> 03:29:50,730
You're stronger!

5488
03:29:53,070 --> 03:29:56,750
He's that sweating, sweating Key and Peele gif.

5489
03:29:57,050 --> 03:29:57,950
Oh, yeah.

5490
03:29:58,350 --> 03:29:58,890
Yeah.

5491
03:29:58,990 --> 03:30:00,390
I'm dying over here.

5492
03:30:00,470 --> 03:30:00,990
Really?

5493
03:30:01,530 --> 03:30:02,550
But you win!

5494
03:30:02,590 --> 03:30:02,630
You win!

5495
03:30:04,810 --> 03:30:07,810
You're winning the round robin one, the ones that don't matter.

5496
03:30:08,270 --> 03:30:09,470
This is what matters.

5497
03:30:09,670 --> 03:30:10,770
I said this first slam.

5498
03:30:10,910 --> 03:30:12,830
We absolutely dominated round robin.

5499
03:30:12,950 --> 03:30:13,430
Who cares?

5500
03:30:13,550 --> 03:30:13,750
You know?

5501
03:30:14,110 --> 03:30:16,210
What do the points even do?

5502
03:30:16,290 --> 03:30:17,610
Is that seeding or?

5503
03:30:17,830 --> 03:30:18,110
Yeah.

5504
03:30:18,210 --> 03:30:20,970
So, like, I guess whoever has the most points gets better seeding or whatever.

5505
03:30:21,250 --> 03:30:21,630
Yeah.

5506
03:30:21,670 --> 03:30:22,470
So, the way this works...

5507
03:30:22,470 --> 03:30:23,730
We should be able to choose our own opponents.

5508
03:30:25,190 --> 03:30:25,930
Only us two?

5509
03:30:25,970 --> 03:30:26,370
Yeah.

5510
03:30:26,710 --> 03:30:27,970
Matt, fight half the club.

5511
03:30:27,970 --> 03:30:30,590
The one with the most points gets to choose who wants to fight.

5512
03:30:30,610 --> 03:30:31,870
I choose Mattman against everyone.

5513
03:30:31,870 --> 03:30:33,290
We just keep putting in Matt.

5514
03:30:33,430 --> 03:30:34,790
I can beat some of the coaches.

5515
03:30:35,910 --> 03:30:36,950
He's just sweating and tired.

5516
03:30:36,950 --> 03:30:38,230
Oh, you're just sweating and tired?

5517
03:30:38,690 --> 03:30:39,930
Every other person is...

5518
03:30:39,930 --> 03:30:42,670
I don't think I can win, but the coaches, you're positive.

5519
03:30:42,870 --> 03:30:43,110
Okay.

5520
03:30:43,830 --> 03:30:45,170
Dude, Amaz is too random.

5521
03:30:45,210 --> 03:30:45,470
I can't.

5522
03:30:47,070 --> 03:30:48,170
But you didn't win.

5523
03:30:50,210 --> 03:30:50,610
Fight.

5524
03:30:51,450 --> 03:30:51,850
Nice.

5525
03:30:53,990 --> 03:30:59,710
I feel like if you win the most points, we should get, like, one bye game where we just don't fight any of them.

5526
03:30:59,790 --> 03:31:01,110
I'm pretty sure that's what's going to happen.

5527
03:31:01,150 --> 03:31:01,510
That's fine.

5528
03:31:01,570 --> 03:31:01,850
That's fine.

5529
03:31:01,850 --> 03:31:02,250
That's what happens.

5530
03:31:02,530 --> 03:31:02,990
Wait, really?

5531
03:31:02,990 --> 03:31:03,350
Yeah, we get a bye.

5532
03:31:03,930 --> 03:31:04,250
Yeah.

5533
03:31:04,390 --> 03:31:09,090
It's a bracket at the end, but there's one more round robin day.

5534
03:31:09,210 --> 03:31:10,810
The points on Friday are one more.

5535
03:31:11,430 --> 03:31:11,850
Yeah, yeah.

5536
03:31:11,890 --> 03:31:14,710
So basically, the top two teams will get, like, a bye.

5537
03:31:15,050 --> 03:31:15,370
Okay.

5538
03:31:16,370 --> 03:31:17,550
We got a bye last time.

5539
03:31:17,630 --> 03:31:17,790
Yeah.

5540
03:31:19,010 --> 03:31:20,050
You're in good company, though.

5541
03:31:20,530 --> 03:31:21,250
Oh, my God.

5542
03:31:21,470 --> 03:31:22,890
I haven't hit my ceiling yet.

5543
03:31:24,950 --> 03:31:25,270
Nice.

5544
03:31:27,510 --> 03:31:29,390
I mean, just look how much we're dominating, you know?

5545
03:31:29,550 --> 03:31:29,870
Like...

5546
03:31:29,870 --> 03:31:30,750
Oh, first hit.

5547
03:31:30,810 --> 03:31:31,210
Iki-Mas.

5548
03:31:31,410 --> 03:31:31,730
Iki-Mas.

5549
03:31:31,730 --> 03:31:31,830
Iki-Mas.

5550
03:31:33,230 --> 03:31:35,170
I want to know how pissed that guy was.

5551
03:31:36,350 --> 03:31:36,830
Wow.

5552
03:31:37,250 --> 03:31:37,730
Wow.

5553
03:31:38,670 --> 03:31:39,150
Fight.

5554
03:31:40,650 --> 03:31:43,690
How would that... someone in chat, my chat was like, she's a robot?

5555
03:31:43,830 --> 03:31:44,730
Why does that even hurt?

5556
03:31:44,850 --> 03:31:46,010
And I think that's a good question.

5557
03:31:46,770 --> 03:31:47,950
Because she has...

5558
03:31:47,950 --> 03:31:48,590
Well, her circuits are like...

5559
03:31:48,590 --> 03:31:50,950
Maybe she's programmed to feel pain.

5560
03:31:51,930 --> 03:31:54,550
Maybe her bar is just her being really annoyed.

5561
03:31:55,250 --> 03:31:56,310
Her annoyed bar.

5562
03:31:56,830 --> 03:31:57,310
Yeah.

5563
03:31:57,370 --> 03:31:57,850
Like, oh, that's annoying.

5564
03:31:57,850 --> 03:31:59,550
If you annoy her enough, she overheats.

5565
03:31:59,970 --> 03:32:00,590
Shutting down.

5566
03:32:00,590 --> 03:32:01,530
The noise of being annoyed.

5567
03:32:01,530 --> 03:32:01,810
Yeah.

5568
03:32:01,830 --> 03:32:02,390
It sucks.

5569
03:32:02,390 --> 03:32:03,070
Does not cook, dude.

5570
03:32:05,170 --> 03:32:08,550
Why would you ever give robots pain sensors?

5571
03:32:08,770 --> 03:32:09,490
That's so fucked up.

5572
03:32:09,490 --> 03:32:10,790
She's taking the arms off.

5573
03:32:10,790 --> 03:32:11,550
It's so funny.

5574
03:32:11,670 --> 03:32:12,590
Is that what that is?

5575
03:32:12,650 --> 03:32:13,090
It's gonna help me.

5576
03:32:14,350 --> 03:32:16,330
I was like, what is he dropping on the ground?

5577
03:32:16,790 --> 03:32:19,250
They should make it so Alyssa self-destructs when she gets KO'd.

5578
03:32:19,310 --> 03:32:20,170
Oh my God.

5579
03:32:20,190 --> 03:32:21,010
That would be so good.

5580
03:32:21,510 --> 03:32:22,670
Drop for a double KO.

5581
03:32:26,050 --> 03:32:27,110
It's like a D.Va bomb.

5582
03:32:27,290 --> 03:32:27,750
Oh, I had double.

5583
03:32:30,490 --> 03:32:30,850
Ow.

5584
03:32:38,300 --> 03:32:38,660
Wow!

5585
03:32:38,660 --> 03:32:38,720
Oh!

5586
03:32:39,640 --> 03:32:41,880
I saw you play Marvel Rivals, did you like it?

5587
03:32:42,200 --> 03:32:43,220
Yeah, it was really fun.

5588
03:32:43,480 --> 03:32:44,300
I think it like...

5589
03:32:44,300 --> 03:32:46,700
I think like... it feels more casual though.

5590
03:32:46,960 --> 03:32:48,180
Because of the third person.

5591
03:32:48,260 --> 03:32:49,740
Yeah, I tried playing it yesterday and I felt the same.

5592
03:32:50,060 --> 03:32:52,320
I think if it was like first person, it would be more competitive.

5593
03:32:53,200 --> 03:32:55,560
Yeah, the third person aspect is kinda weird though.

5594
03:32:56,400 --> 03:32:57,560
That's a mobile game, right?

5595
03:32:57,620 --> 03:32:58,700
They're trying to make it for phones too.

5596
03:32:59,580 --> 03:33:00,880
I won't be surprised!

5597
03:33:01,260 --> 03:33:02,340
Because it's like NetEase.

5598
03:33:03,660 --> 03:33:06,440
I played a little bit of it and I was like, this is okay, you know?

5599
03:33:06,460 --> 03:33:09,440
I think it's not competitive, but more so for like...

5600
03:33:09,440 --> 03:33:09,920
for fun.

5601
03:33:10,200 --> 03:33:16,980
I just thought it was funny that like all the old Overwatch players were grinding... were six stacking rank and getting top 10.

5602
03:33:16,980 --> 03:33:19,060
Yeah, you got Sinatraa and shit just fucking dominating.

5603
03:33:20,320 --> 03:33:20,800
Yeah!

5604
03:33:21,000 --> 03:33:25,200
All the Overwatch players, the old ones, are like top 20 in Marvel Rivals.

5605
03:33:25,680 --> 03:33:28,620
Because all they do is six stack and bully the poor players.

5606
03:33:34,080 --> 03:33:36,020
We are not breaking one.

5607
03:33:36,020 --> 03:33:37,440
Not now, not ever.

5608
03:33:40,720 --> 03:33:41,440
Oh wow.

5609
03:33:42,900 --> 03:33:44,220
What the fuck is that?

5610
03:33:45,520 --> 03:33:46,560
Oh, what the fuck?

5611
03:33:47,480 --> 03:33:48,940
What is that move?

5612
03:33:50,080 --> 03:33:52,340
You can't even tell them to talk to coach.

5613
03:33:52,560 --> 03:33:52,880
You can't even tell them to talk to coach.

5614
03:33:52,880 --> 03:33:54,200
Like, you are the coach!

5615
03:33:54,380 --> 03:33:54,460
Yeah!

5616
03:33:58,940 --> 03:33:59,960
Shit off me.

5617
03:34:00,400 --> 03:34:01,400
Those are arms.

5618
03:34:02,120 --> 03:34:03,220
Yeah, yeah, they're her arms.

5619
03:34:03,360 --> 03:34:05,940
If you tech her 1 plus 2, she puts her head in your hand.

5620
03:34:06,020 --> 03:34:07,620
And then you just put it back on her neck.

5621
03:34:07,940 --> 03:34:08,800
Like, not that.

5622
03:34:09,240 --> 03:34:11,660
Wait, you can put it back on her head?

5623
03:34:12,260 --> 03:34:12,840
Yeah, yeah.

5624
03:34:12,860 --> 03:34:15,100
If he techs that grab, he puts it back on her.

5625
03:34:15,180 --> 03:34:16,180
Wait, that's so cool.

5626
03:34:16,740 --> 03:34:17,540
It's really funny.

5627
03:34:19,520 --> 03:34:20,660
Coach, show us that.

5628
03:34:21,960 --> 03:34:24,460
He was flabbergasted that he didn't tech it.

5629
03:34:24,560 --> 03:34:25,040
Got it.

5630
03:34:25,340 --> 03:34:26,660
I thought I pressed it.

5631
03:34:26,760 --> 03:34:28,640
I wanna see it.

5632
03:34:29,860 --> 03:34:30,300
Fight!

5633
03:34:32,360 --> 03:34:33,560
Just tech it perfectly.

5634
03:34:33,620 --> 03:34:34,260
You got this.

5635
03:34:45,670 --> 03:34:46,430
Nice.

5636
03:34:46,430 --> 03:34:46,950
Nice.

5637
03:34:46,950 --> 03:34:48,210
Her defense is really good.

5638
03:34:51,640 --> 03:34:52,400
Nice.

5639
03:34:52,640 --> 03:34:53,340
Oh, nice.

5640
03:34:53,380 --> 03:34:53,760
Oh!

5641
03:34:58,780 --> 03:35:00,760
Oh my god.

5642
03:35:00,800 --> 03:35:01,400
You waited too.

5643
03:35:01,600 --> 03:35:03,420
Every button on the controller.

5644
03:35:05,500 --> 03:35:07,560
That fucking delay too.

5645
03:35:08,060 --> 03:35:09,620
A buffet of options.

5646
03:35:10,620 --> 03:35:11,380
Oh!

5647
03:35:11,380 --> 03:35:12,260
Oh my god.

5648
03:35:12,860 --> 03:35:13,620
Shit!

5649
03:35:15,060 --> 03:35:15,780
The prediction!

5650
03:35:16,840 --> 03:35:16,960
Oh my gosh!

5651
03:35:20,520 --> 03:35:22,400
That's the brain destroyer, yeah.

5652
03:35:24,200 --> 03:35:25,100
Oh my god.

5653
03:35:25,100 --> 03:35:27,000
Her mental's gone after seeing that.

5654
03:35:27,300 --> 03:35:28,660
I mean, mine would be.

5655
03:35:30,720 --> 03:35:31,680
Coach, platform.

5656
03:35:36,310 --> 03:35:37,030
Oh wow.

5657
03:35:37,230 --> 03:35:38,070
You hit that?

5658
03:35:38,810 --> 03:35:39,290
Nice!

5659
03:35:41,810 --> 03:35:43,390
She has her rage art too, though.

5660
03:35:44,750 --> 03:35:46,170
She's never gonna use it.

5661
03:35:47,690 --> 03:35:48,170
She's never gonna use it.

5662
03:35:48,170 --> 03:35:48,190
She's never gonna use it.

5663
03:35:48,190 --> 03:35:50,110
She doesn't pop that.

5664
03:35:50,150 --> 03:35:51,070
She would not.

5665
03:35:52,310 --> 03:35:53,630
I told you!

5666
03:35:55,190 --> 03:35:56,850
I read her inputs.

5667
03:35:57,290 --> 03:35:57,690
She would...

5668
03:36:00,010 --> 03:36:01,250
I'm in her PC.

5669
03:36:02,570 --> 03:36:02,870
That's...

5670
03:36:03,510 --> 03:36:05,030
You took damage from that?

5671
03:36:05,110 --> 03:36:07,570
Oh, we're doing it again?

5672
03:36:08,550 --> 03:36:09,950
Oh, not this time, though.

5673
03:36:09,970 --> 03:36:10,410
Yeah, I know.

5674
03:36:11,250 --> 03:36:12,950
No way, the bridge?

5675
03:36:13,010 --> 03:36:13,510
What?

5676
03:36:14,290 --> 03:36:15,350
What is this move?

5677
03:36:15,350 --> 03:36:15,530
Oh!

5678
03:36:15,690 --> 03:36:18,410
Oh my god!

5679
03:36:18,570 --> 03:36:19,570
My leg!

5680
03:36:20,090 --> 03:36:22,250
What the fuck kind of move was that?

5681
03:36:23,030 --> 03:36:24,550
You think I could do that?

5682
03:36:26,850 --> 03:36:28,090
Miles, get up!

5683
03:36:28,970 --> 03:36:30,090
Oh my god!

5684
03:36:31,290 --> 03:36:31,910
Oh!

5685
03:36:31,910 --> 03:36:32,530
Nice!

5686
03:36:33,210 --> 03:36:34,790
The king streak continues!

5687
03:36:35,810 --> 03:36:37,310
Coach, good adaptation.

5688
03:36:38,150 --> 03:36:39,090
That was beautiful.

5689
03:36:39,490 --> 03:36:40,050
That's 4-1, baby!

5690
03:36:40,490 --> 03:36:42,290
Nice job.

5691
03:36:42,490 --> 03:36:43,670
We 4-1'd that shit.

5692
03:36:43,870 --> 03:36:44,430
Let's go!

5693
03:36:45,350 --> 03:36:45,510
We're...

5694
03:36:46,250 --> 03:36:46,770
Woo!

5695
03:36:48,550 --> 03:36:51,930
I was... like, in the second game, I started enjoying the conversation.

5696
03:36:52,210 --> 03:36:53,190
Maybe it's too much.

5697
03:36:53,190 --> 03:36:54,630
I know, you were paying attention to the Overwatch.

5698
03:36:54,850 --> 03:36:55,030
Yeah!

5699
03:36:55,730 --> 03:36:58,590
I could see you, like, not paying attention.

5700
03:36:58,710 --> 03:36:59,570
Was I awful?

5701
03:37:00,570 --> 03:37:01,970
My chat's just like, BP?

5702
03:37:02,210 --> 03:37:02,730
Question mark?

5703
03:37:02,770 --> 03:37:03,030
BP?

5704
03:37:03,670 --> 03:37:06,630
I was thinking about Dive versus Brawl.

5705
03:37:06,830 --> 03:37:09,130
Oh my god, guys, we all won a match!

5706
03:37:09,690 --> 03:37:10,650
That's fucking...

5707
03:37:10,650 --> 03:37:11,770
Yeah, all of us!

5708
03:37:12,810 --> 03:37:13,530
That's true!

5709
03:37:13,710 --> 03:37:13,970
Yeah!

5710
03:37:15,970 --> 03:37:17,450
We all won one!

5711
03:37:19,810 --> 03:37:21,230
I had to win that.

5712
03:37:21,350 --> 03:37:22,450
I would've gotten fired.

5713
03:37:23,510 --> 03:37:24,570
On the king team.

5714
03:37:26,170 --> 03:37:28,350
Yeah, I wouldn't listen to you anymore if you lost that.

5715
03:37:28,350 --> 03:37:29,810
Oh, she said she's teleporting back.

5716
03:37:30,330 --> 03:37:30,890
Am I?

5717
03:37:31,010 --> 03:37:32,170
I mean, I'm on Fiverr.

5718
03:37:32,230 --> 03:37:33,470
I don't fucking know, dude.

5719
03:37:34,250 --> 03:37:35,390
Check the stream, I guess.

5720
03:37:37,430 --> 03:37:38,490
We did it, guys.

5721
03:37:38,850 --> 03:37:40,070
We have one more left, right?

5722
03:37:40,710 --> 03:37:41,870
I think one more, yeah.

5723
03:37:41,970 --> 03:37:44,610
One more team, and then we can all fuck off.

5724
03:37:44,930 --> 03:37:45,330
Yeah.

5725
03:37:45,330 --> 03:37:46,330
Yeah, we're against Kaiser's team.

5726
03:37:46,450 --> 03:37:47,050
You're on Fiverr?

5727
03:37:47,110 --> 03:37:47,270
Yeah.

5728
03:37:47,770 --> 03:37:49,390
Are they making the lobby now?

5729
03:37:49,990 --> 03:37:52,630
We have time to warm up or nah?

5730
03:37:53,250 --> 03:37:54,190
They'll do a quick match.

5731
03:37:54,330 --> 03:37:55,030
It's not a big deal.

5732
03:37:55,150 --> 03:37:56,410
And you can join us, whatever.

5733
03:37:56,590 --> 03:37:56,970
Alright, yeah.

5734
03:37:57,070 --> 03:37:58,250
I'm gonna make them wait for me.

5735
03:37:58,790 --> 03:38:01,510
Yeah, just be like, I'm fucking Doki Bird.

5736
03:38:03,010 --> 03:38:04,470
Chill the fuck out while I play my quick match.

5737
03:38:04,830 --> 03:38:05,790
Yeah, chill out, guys.

5738
03:38:11,860 --> 03:38:12,220
Kazuyamishima.

5739
03:38:14,680 --> 03:38:15,260
You know what?

5740
03:38:15,280 --> 03:38:16,660
I already won my one game.

5741
03:38:17,060 --> 03:38:18,080
That was my goal.

5742
03:38:18,960 --> 03:38:19,920
Now I can coast.

5743
03:38:27,860 --> 03:38:29,480
Oh my god, guys!

5744
03:38:29,980 --> 03:38:31,120
I won a game!

5745
03:38:32,380 --> 03:38:34,420
Are you that proud of me?

5746
03:38:34,460 --> 03:38:36,660
I did it!

5747
03:38:36,720 --> 03:38:39,980
Yeah, because they're like a setting that you're supposed to set it to, to make it so that you don't win.

5748
03:38:41,040 --> 03:38:42,500
What the fuck is...

5749
03:38:42,500 --> 03:38:45,080
Guys, I swear I'll plug me in my PC tomorrow.

5750
03:38:45,480 --> 03:38:46,060
I swear I'll plug me in my PC tomorrow.

5751
03:38:48,680 --> 03:38:49,640
I swear.

5752
03:38:50,160 --> 03:38:50,640
I swear.

5753
03:38:50,860 --> 03:38:51,160
I swear.

5754
03:38:53,160 --> 03:38:54,300
We did it!

5755
03:38:54,960 --> 03:38:57,060
We did it!

5756
03:38:57,060 --> 03:38:59,020
You guys are believers, right?

5757
03:38:59,320 --> 03:38:59,620
You guys are believers, right?

5758
03:38:59,620 --> 03:39:00,800
You guys all believe in me?

5759
03:39:02,900 --> 03:39:04,500
You still have...

5760
03:39:04,500 --> 03:39:06,020
Oh, she's saying it was 3 frame rollback.

5761
03:39:06,100 --> 03:39:08,220
But then, there's nothing you can really do about that.

5762
03:39:08,360 --> 03:39:09,680
That's just what it is.

5763
03:39:10,200 --> 03:39:11,600
Guys, I promise.

5764
03:39:12,200 --> 03:39:13,760
It was more than 3 frames.

5765
03:39:13,780 --> 03:39:16,060
That was like the PS4 cannot win.

5766
03:39:16,080 --> 03:39:17,220
I understand what's happening.

5767
03:39:17,340 --> 03:39:18,260
I guess it's PS5.

5768
03:39:18,420 --> 03:39:19,360
It felt like PS4.

5769
03:39:19,660 --> 03:39:21,400
Okay, I wanna practice this.

5770
03:39:21,960 --> 03:39:24,640
Because I wanna be able to do this one day.

5771
03:39:26,580 --> 03:39:27,100
Because I wanna be able to do this one day.

5772
03:39:27,100 --> 03:39:27,400
Guys, I...

5773
03:39:27,400 --> 03:39:29,020
I can only go up.

5774
03:39:30,040 --> 03:39:31,640
I can only go up.

5775
03:39:31,640 --> 03:39:32,680
I'm just telling her to switch it to standard.

5776
03:39:32,980 --> 03:39:33,840
I should do that too.

5777
03:39:33,940 --> 03:39:34,900
I should change the map.

5778
03:39:35,640 --> 03:39:36,900
I don't like this map.

5779
03:39:36,980 --> 03:39:37,560
It's too short.

5780
03:39:39,120 --> 03:39:40,560
Do the king bridge.

5781
03:39:41,500 --> 03:39:42,360
The what?

5782
03:39:44,240 --> 03:39:45,440
I saw it.

5783
03:39:45,480 --> 03:39:46,540
But I don't know if you guys understand.

5784
03:39:46,920 --> 03:39:48,820
I don't know how that is done.

5785
03:39:52,140 --> 03:39:54,140
Yeah, once I got the PC plugged in.

5786
03:39:54,180 --> 03:39:56,120
I'll be able to pull off the king bridge.

5787
03:39:56,500 --> 03:39:58,140
I promise on that.

5788
03:39:58,320 --> 03:39:59,740
Guys, I promise.

5789
03:39:59,920 --> 03:40:01,460
I'll plug in the PC.

5790
03:40:02,460 --> 03:40:03,540
It's by tomorrow.

5791
03:40:04,460 --> 03:40:06,600
I got like the first step done.

5792
03:40:07,260 --> 03:40:08,880
I like unboxed it.

5793
03:40:09,540 --> 03:40:11,600
Do they want us right into the next one?

5794
03:40:11,660 --> 03:40:12,340
Like, right now?

5795
03:40:12,360 --> 03:40:13,280
Right now?

5796
03:40:14,420 --> 03:40:15,160
Are we hanging out?

5797
03:40:16,360 --> 03:40:16,940
I don't know.

5798
03:40:16,980 --> 03:40:18,300
I'm doing quick match until someone says something.

5799
03:40:19,160 --> 03:40:19,800
Yeah, me too.

5800
03:40:19,920 --> 03:40:21,020
I'm doing quick match right now.

5801
03:40:22,740 --> 03:40:23,340
Who's this girl?

5802
03:40:23,680 --> 03:40:26,460
Oh my gosh, she has five wins.

5803
03:40:26,680 --> 03:40:27,200
I'm fucked.

5804
03:40:28,180 --> 03:40:28,580
Okay.

5805
03:40:30,240 --> 03:40:33,640
Please, can I do that combo my coach is trying to teach me?

5806
03:40:33,700 --> 03:40:34,080
Please.

5807
03:40:35,320 --> 03:40:38,460
I'm trying to do this combo that my coach is trying to teach me.

5808
03:40:38,860 --> 03:40:39,700
I don't care.

5809
03:40:39,760 --> 03:40:40,640
I'm in a quick match.

5810
03:40:41,400 --> 03:40:41,800
Please.

5811
03:40:44,200 --> 03:40:44,820
There you go.

5812
03:40:45,960 --> 03:40:46,360
No!

5813
03:40:46,560 --> 03:40:47,660
I fucked it up!

5814
03:40:47,780 --> 03:40:48,680
Please, please.

5815
03:40:48,740 --> 03:40:49,660
I need to do this combo.

5816
03:40:49,720 --> 03:40:50,880
I don't care if I lose this.

5817
03:40:51,700 --> 03:40:53,040
Let me do this combo.

5818
03:40:53,420 --> 03:40:55,000
Don't make me pull off this.

5819
03:40:55,780 --> 03:40:56,680
Oh, never mind.

5820
03:40:56,760 --> 03:40:57,500
You can just kill me.

5821
03:41:01,900 --> 03:41:02,300
Please.

5822
03:41:04,800 --> 03:41:07,360
Please, I just want to pull off this one combo.

5823
03:41:08,660 --> 03:41:09,460
I did it!

5824
03:41:09,640 --> 03:41:11,280
I pulled it off in game!

5825
03:41:12,560 --> 03:41:13,700
Oh my god!

5826
03:41:13,740 --> 03:41:15,020
Nothing matters anymore.

5827
03:41:15,180 --> 03:41:15,920
Now you die.

5828
03:41:19,700 --> 03:41:20,900
Now you die.

5829
03:41:21,640 --> 03:41:22,900
I pulled it off.

5830
03:41:25,420 --> 03:41:26,200
Oh shit.

5831
03:41:26,300 --> 03:41:26,820
No, never mind.

5832
03:41:26,900 --> 03:41:27,660
I thought she would keep.

5833
03:41:31,040 --> 03:41:31,560
Yay!

5834
03:41:34,300 --> 03:41:35,420
That's all I wanted.

5835
03:41:35,540 --> 03:41:36,040
Please.

5836
03:41:37,760 --> 03:41:38,280
Oh!

5837
03:41:38,280 --> 03:41:39,660
I pulled it off again!

5838
03:41:41,940 --> 03:41:42,820
And then...

5839
03:41:42,820 --> 03:41:43,480
Oh, okay.

5840
03:41:43,540 --> 03:41:43,880
Never mind.

5841
03:41:43,980 --> 03:41:46,240
I thought she would let me keep doing this on her.

5842
03:41:47,480 --> 03:41:47,920
Guys.

5843
03:41:48,100 --> 03:41:52,800
Guys, this is actually... I need you guys to know that was the first time I've ever pulled that combo off.

5844
03:41:53,060 --> 03:41:53,960
Like, actually.

5845
03:41:54,400 --> 03:41:56,120
The very first time.

5846
03:42:00,320 --> 03:42:00,760
Red.

5847
03:42:00,760 --> 03:42:01,200
Mayo.

5848
03:42:02,800 --> 03:42:05,300
Like, now I can actually not care.

5849
03:42:08,500 --> 03:42:10,660
There are out of five wins in game streak!

5850
03:42:10,940 --> 03:42:11,920
There's no way!

5851
03:42:12,260 --> 03:42:12,860
There's no way!

5852
03:42:12,860 --> 03:42:13,140
There's new player!

5853
03:42:18,320 --> 03:42:18,960
Oh god.

5854
03:42:19,460 --> 03:42:20,900
Please, give me a down...

5855
03:42:20,900 --> 03:42:22,220
Forward, forward, neutral.

5856
03:42:22,340 --> 03:42:22,600
Please.

5857
03:42:22,940 --> 03:42:24,920
Please, that's the other combo I want to learn.

5858
03:42:26,000 --> 03:42:26,740
Oh my god.

5859
03:42:26,780 --> 03:42:28,020
Don't make me do this on you.

5860
03:42:30,820 --> 03:42:33,580
Now I can focus on improving my other stuff!

5861
03:42:33,680 --> 03:42:33,900
Now I can focus on improving my other stuff!

5862
03:42:33,900 --> 03:42:34,480
Like blocking!

5863
03:42:34,480 --> 03:42:37,000
Because what the fuck is blocking?

5864
03:42:41,800 --> 03:42:42,800
There we go.

5865
03:42:46,240 --> 03:42:47,200
Guys, I blocked.

5866
03:42:48,140 --> 03:42:48,760
Guys, I...

5867
03:42:48,760 --> 03:42:50,740
Guys, I fucked around.

5868
03:42:54,160 --> 03:42:56,500
I was trying to learn how to block.

5869
03:42:57,340 --> 03:42:57,820
Guys...

5870
03:42:57,820 --> 03:42:58,600
Oh, fuck!

5871
03:42:58,800 --> 03:42:59,960
Guys, okay, look.

5872
03:43:00,740 --> 03:43:03,080
The goal was to block nothing else.

5873
03:43:04,280 --> 03:43:06,160
I did not need to learn anything else.

5874
03:43:06,520 --> 03:43:08,960
It was just about learning the blocks.

5875
03:43:16,560 --> 03:43:18,640
We lost, but we learned.

5876
03:43:19,160 --> 03:43:24,320
We actually hit that combo for the first time against a real player.

5877
03:43:24,900 --> 03:43:26,590
I will learn how to...

5878
03:43:27,240 --> 03:43:30,340
True, it's a fighting game, not a blocking game.

5879
03:43:30,540 --> 03:43:31,460
That is true.

5880
03:43:31,600 --> 03:43:33,460
All I wanted was to really hit this move.

5881
03:43:33,760 --> 03:43:34,960
That's all I wanted.

5882
03:43:35,120 --> 03:43:36,000
And also like this.

5883
03:43:36,000 --> 03:43:36,800
This is the next goal.

5884
03:43:37,200 --> 03:43:40,320
Being able to hit this and then this.

5885
03:43:41,440 --> 03:43:42,180
Next goal!

5886
03:43:42,800 --> 03:43:45,220
Being able to hit that on a real player.

5887
03:43:46,280 --> 03:43:47,280
And then...

5888
03:43:47,280 --> 03:43:48,640
Oh, no, that's the smash.

5889
03:43:48,880 --> 03:43:49,120
Okay.

5890
03:43:49,940 --> 03:43:50,620
Got that.

5891
03:43:51,580 --> 03:43:52,580
No, not that!

5892
03:43:53,400 --> 03:43:54,340
No, not that!

5893
03:43:55,020 --> 03:43:55,880
One day.

5894
03:43:57,220 --> 03:43:59,220
Blocking is disabled in this game.

5895
03:44:00,220 --> 03:44:00,740
Alright.

5896
03:44:00,740 --> 03:44:01,000
Alright.

5897
03:44:04,520 --> 03:44:05,180
It's okay.

5898
03:44:05,440 --> 03:44:06,000
Oh, no.

5899
03:44:06,060 --> 03:44:06,600
It's an eddy.

5900
03:44:07,240 --> 03:44:08,000
Oh, no.

5901
03:44:09,840 --> 03:44:11,080
Death cradle next.

5902
03:44:11,320 --> 03:44:16,380
You see, my coach made me remove the keybind to do the death cradle.

5903
03:44:16,680 --> 03:44:19,700
Because I kept accidentally pressing it and it's not good.

5904
03:44:22,080 --> 03:44:26,680
It was not good that I kept accidentally pressing it.

5905
03:44:26,760 --> 03:44:28,040
Because it's a key charge.

5906
03:44:31,780 --> 03:44:34,960
So I had to unbind it because of it.

5907
03:44:37,840 --> 03:44:38,820
Oh, please.

5908
03:44:39,000 --> 03:44:39,820
Eddie, please.

5909
03:44:41,540 --> 03:44:42,860
Please have mercy.

5910
03:44:43,160 --> 03:44:43,400
Oh!

5911
03:44:43,780 --> 03:44:44,340
Goodbye.

5912
03:44:49,390 --> 03:44:50,630
It's very predictable.

5913
03:44:50,790 --> 03:44:52,590
Not for that one guy I beat.

5914
03:44:55,370 --> 03:44:57,970
It might be predictable for you.

5915
03:44:58,270 --> 03:45:00,150
But I beat that one guy.

5916
03:45:00,170 --> 03:45:02,790
And he still didn't learn.

5917
03:45:05,850 --> 03:45:06,630
Oh, wait.

5918
03:45:06,690 --> 03:45:07,570
He actually blocked that.

5919
03:45:07,590 --> 03:45:08,370
I could have grappled him.

5920
03:45:09,890 --> 03:45:10,790
Please block.

5921
03:45:11,050 --> 03:45:11,370
Okay.

5922
03:45:12,090 --> 03:45:13,010
How much?

5923
03:45:15,410 --> 03:45:15,950
Block.

5924
03:45:16,610 --> 03:45:17,550
Pay to block.

5925
03:45:23,430 --> 03:45:23,970
Okay.

5926
03:45:26,630 --> 03:45:28,270
They want me to start blocking.

5927
03:45:28,470 --> 03:45:30,270
So, like, can you please...

5928
03:45:31,930 --> 03:45:32,370
Okay.

5929
03:45:32,610 --> 03:45:33,090
It's okay.

5930
03:45:33,150 --> 03:45:33,750
It's a quick play.

5931
03:45:33,990 --> 03:45:35,370
There's no stakes involved.

5932
03:45:36,110 --> 03:45:37,530
Pay to block.

5933
03:45:42,390 --> 03:45:43,270
This time.

5934
03:45:43,490 --> 03:45:43,870
Yeah!

5935
03:45:44,190 --> 03:45:45,870
I noticed you stopped blocking me!

5936
03:45:46,030 --> 03:45:46,450
Oh, shit.

5937
03:45:46,490 --> 03:45:46,870
Never mind.

5938
03:45:48,230 --> 03:45:48,670
JK.

5939
03:45:48,670 --> 03:45:49,310
Oh, no.

5940
03:45:50,710 --> 03:45:51,150
Guys.

5941
03:45:52,630 --> 03:45:53,070
Yay!

5942
03:45:53,950 --> 03:45:54,550
Come on.

5943
03:45:54,970 --> 03:45:55,590
Come on.

5944
03:45:56,290 --> 03:45:56,970
Oh, shit.

5945
03:45:56,990 --> 03:45:58,330
I thought you were gonna stay on the ground.

5946
03:46:01,190 --> 03:46:02,370
Pay to block.

5947
03:46:02,650 --> 03:46:02,850
Pay to block.

5948
03:46:02,850 --> 03:46:03,690
And then lose.

5949
03:46:04,270 --> 03:46:05,570
Hey, look.

5950
03:46:05,750 --> 03:46:07,950
I did one that two sets there.

5951
03:46:08,330 --> 03:46:08,970
Goodbye.

5952
03:46:09,190 --> 03:46:09,910
I'm a one and done.

5953
03:46:10,290 --> 03:46:12,210
Get ready for the next battle.

5954
03:46:12,990 --> 03:46:14,730
Thank you for blocking.

5955
03:46:18,070 --> 03:46:20,390
Every dollar I block once.

5956
03:46:24,970 --> 03:46:25,610
Yay!

5957
03:46:30,350 --> 03:46:30,870
Alright.

5958
03:46:31,250 --> 03:46:31,770
Goodbye.

5959
03:46:33,070 --> 03:46:34,850
I still need to learn...

5960
03:46:34,850 --> 03:46:36,710
I need to get that neutral...

5961
03:46:36,710 --> 03:46:38,270
neutral grab, correct?

5962
03:46:39,150 --> 03:46:40,770
You're never allowed to block.

5963
03:46:40,910 --> 03:46:44,710
This is how Doki becomes a multi-billionaire.

5964
03:46:46,050 --> 03:46:46,930
Look, guys.

5965
03:46:47,010 --> 03:46:48,810
It's a hard life out there being cunting.

5966
03:46:49,750 --> 03:46:50,270
Wait.

5967
03:46:50,310 --> 03:46:50,630
I'm here.

5968
03:46:50,770 --> 03:46:50,830
I'm here.

5969
03:46:51,270 --> 03:46:51,790
Sorry.

5970
03:46:53,350 --> 03:46:56,570
You gotta make some economic decisions.

5971
03:46:57,150 --> 03:46:57,290
Fight!

5972
03:46:57,290 --> 03:46:57,730
Fight!

5973
03:46:57,830 --> 03:46:59,510
Are we ready?

5974
03:47:01,570 --> 03:47:02,930
What room is this?

5975
03:47:03,070 --> 03:47:03,510
Stage?

5976
03:47:03,550 --> 03:47:04,130
Oh, no.

5977
03:47:04,470 --> 03:47:05,190
I don't know.

5978
03:47:05,190 --> 03:47:05,730
I haven't been at it yet.

5979
03:47:06,170 --> 03:47:07,050
Oh, okay.

5980
03:47:08,950 --> 03:47:11,730
Cause SageM was like, oh, we have a Kingmare coming up Doki.

5981
03:47:11,810 --> 03:47:12,710
And I was like, oh, shit.

5982
03:47:12,730 --> 03:47:13,150
Oh, yay.

5983
03:47:14,510 --> 03:47:14,950
Boom!

5984
03:47:16,650 --> 03:47:18,070
The only move I know!

5985
03:47:18,970 --> 03:47:19,410
Boom!

5986
03:47:19,410 --> 03:47:20,730
And this one too!

5987
03:47:22,310 --> 03:47:22,750
See?

5988
03:47:23,550 --> 03:47:24,170
I blocked!

5989
03:47:26,510 --> 03:47:27,570
There you go.

5990
03:47:27,630 --> 03:47:28,110
There you go.

5991
03:47:28,550 --> 03:47:29,070
Fight!

5992
03:47:31,430 --> 03:47:33,110
Three moves that I know!

5993
03:47:33,330 --> 03:47:34,890
You gotta learn how to block them!

5994
03:47:37,640 --> 03:47:39,180
And then the steps!

5995
03:47:39,460 --> 03:47:40,760
And then the steps!

5996
03:47:41,160 --> 03:47:41,920
That's right!

5997
03:47:46,180 --> 03:47:47,720
Can she juggle?

5998
03:47:47,840 --> 03:47:49,400
That is such a good question.

5999
03:47:51,300 --> 03:47:51,820
Easy.

6000
03:47:53,340 --> 03:47:55,500
Yeah, if I find myself losing, just grab.

6001
03:47:55,720 --> 03:47:56,100
Look at this.

6002
03:47:56,120 --> 03:47:57,440
The three moves that I need to know.

6003
03:47:57,540 --> 03:48:01,600
Do you guys think they're gonna analyze me and realize I only do literally three moves?

6004
03:48:04,060 --> 03:48:04,580
Yes!

6005
03:48:05,120 --> 03:48:05,640
Yes!

6006
03:48:06,280 --> 03:48:09,960
Guys, there's no way they're gonna analyze me, right?

6007
03:48:10,640 --> 03:48:12,240
And like, realize that.

6008
03:48:12,660 --> 03:48:14,100
There's no fucking way.

6009
03:48:15,840 --> 03:48:17,240
If you need help...

6010
03:48:17,240 --> 03:48:18,600
Oh, yeah, I definitely need.

6011
03:48:20,360 --> 03:48:21,440
There's no way!

6012
03:48:21,500 --> 03:48:22,440
After Round Robin 1?

6013
03:48:23,120 --> 03:48:23,640
No.

6014
03:48:26,120 --> 03:48:26,360
Oh shit.

6015
03:48:27,220 --> 03:48:29,460
Oh my god, she already learned after like, 1.

6016
03:48:30,320 --> 03:48:31,580
How did she know?

6017
03:48:33,040 --> 03:48:36,560
It's not like I've been doing that like, this entire time.

6018
03:48:37,220 --> 03:48:38,780
No fucking way.

6019
03:48:39,460 --> 03:48:40,200
Oh shit.

6020
03:48:41,140 --> 03:48:42,680
Guys, I think she learned.

6021
03:48:43,480 --> 03:48:44,800
It's actually crazy.

6022
03:48:46,200 --> 03:48:47,280
You blocked!

6023
03:48:47,460 --> 03:48:48,900
I'm proud of you!

6024
03:48:49,320 --> 03:48:50,260
Team Kaiser.

6025
03:48:52,000 --> 03:48:52,840
Oh shit.

6026
03:48:52,940 --> 03:48:53,600
Okay, we got it.

6027
03:48:53,600 --> 03:48:54,660
Our match starts.

6028
03:48:55,840 --> 03:48:57,020
Our match is starting.

6029
03:48:57,260 --> 03:48:58,800
Back swing fucking demon, dude.

6030
03:48:59,540 --> 03:49:00,880
Yeah, I know about that.

6031
03:49:01,240 --> 03:49:01,260
Burn!

6032
03:49:02,420 --> 03:49:02,900
Oh shit.

6033
03:49:06,620 --> 03:49:07,440
Oh shit.

6034
03:49:08,220 --> 03:49:09,680
Please, let me live.

6035
03:49:10,380 --> 03:49:10,860
Please.

6036
03:49:16,910 --> 03:49:17,750
She's not gonna duck.

6037
03:49:19,670 --> 03:49:21,130
You know how I know that?

6038
03:49:21,990 --> 03:49:23,630
Because she also doesn't learn.

6039
03:49:33,610 --> 03:49:35,430
Yeah, I'm kidding.

6040
03:49:35,990 --> 03:49:36,270
Yeah, I'm kidding.

6041
03:49:36,270 --> 03:49:36,610
Yeah, I'm kidding.

6042
03:49:36,610 --> 03:49:36,630
Yeah, I'm kidding.

6043
03:49:36,630 --> 03:49:37,730
Yeah, I'm kidding.

6044
03:49:38,610 --> 03:49:39,330
Alright.

6045
03:49:40,850 --> 03:49:41,850
Let's see.

6046
03:49:42,210 --> 03:49:42,370
Let's see.

6047
03:49:43,470 --> 03:49:44,190
Uh...

6048
03:49:45,050 --> 03:49:47,510
Oh, who's making the lobby?

6049
03:49:47,650 --> 03:49:48,610
They pinged us.

6050
03:49:49,850 --> 03:49:51,230
So, I don't...

6051
03:49:51,230 --> 03:49:51,990
Let's see.

6052
03:49:55,960 --> 03:49:57,200
Are we back on?

6053
03:49:57,440 --> 03:49:57,800
Are we back on?

6054
03:49:59,400 --> 03:50:00,420
We're gonna be on the mainstream.

6055
03:50:01,300 --> 03:50:01,780
Apparently.

6056
03:50:02,320 --> 03:50:02,800
Yeah.

6057
03:50:05,160 --> 03:50:07,420
We're gonna be on the big screen, guys!

6058
03:50:07,860 --> 03:50:08,560
We're gonna be famous!

6059
03:50:08,560 --> 03:50:10,900
The guy I'm playing has not dropped a game, apparently.

6060
03:50:11,060 --> 03:50:11,520
He's nice.

6061
03:50:12,140 --> 03:50:14,080
Then you're gonna drop his game.

6062
03:50:14,100 --> 03:50:15,200
Sure no, I think.

6063
03:50:15,880 --> 03:50:16,720
Sure no, solid.

6064
03:50:19,280 --> 03:50:20,420
This is it.

6065
03:50:20,540 --> 03:50:21,880
You're gonna make him regret it.

6066
03:50:23,540 --> 03:50:24,560
It'll be fine.

6067
03:50:25,160 --> 03:50:25,920
I believe.

6068
03:50:26,460 --> 03:50:29,060
So, you say he's one of the best third seeds.

6069
03:50:29,920 --> 03:50:31,120
Along with Kony.

6070
03:50:31,240 --> 03:50:31,480
Okay.

6071
03:50:33,140 --> 03:50:34,120
If I lose data...

6072
03:50:34,120 --> 03:50:34,440
Oh yeah!

6073
03:50:34,720 --> 03:50:35,180
Cerno!

6074
03:50:35,480 --> 03:50:36,420
I know Cerno.

6075
03:50:36,580 --> 03:50:37,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6076
03:50:37,320 --> 03:50:39,620
He's been a streamer for a fucking long time.

6077
03:50:39,920 --> 03:50:40,460
Hasn't he?

6078
03:50:42,500 --> 03:50:44,180
He's like one of the OGs.

6079
03:50:45,740 --> 03:50:46,380
Is he?

6080
03:50:46,520 --> 03:50:48,080
I see him around Tekken streams.

6081
03:50:48,200 --> 03:50:50,680
Even before the Sajan thing was even a thing.

6082
03:50:52,860 --> 03:50:55,880
I know he's been around for a very long time.

6083
03:50:56,360 --> 03:50:58,120
Tekken wasn't his content.

6084
03:50:58,580 --> 03:51:00,180
He used to do other stuff.

6085
03:51:00,680 --> 03:51:01,240
Really?

6086
03:51:01,320 --> 03:51:01,720
That's sick.

6087
03:51:02,640 --> 03:51:03,720
Oh, code's up.

6088
03:51:03,800 --> 03:51:04,300
Stage 1.

6089
03:51:09,680 --> 03:51:12,940
Here we go.

6090
03:51:18,210 --> 03:51:18,870
Don't worry.

6091
03:51:19,130 --> 03:51:20,550
I won't leak the code, guys.

6092
03:51:20,570 --> 03:51:21,210
There's a password.

6093
03:51:21,730 --> 03:51:22,430
I will.

6094
03:51:22,710 --> 03:51:23,270
Oh.

6095
03:51:25,370 --> 03:51:26,190
I almost.

6096
03:51:27,490 --> 03:51:28,130
It's okay.

6097
03:51:28,190 --> 03:51:30,850
The code is 8543, guys.

6098
03:51:31,230 --> 03:51:32,190
Oh my god.

6099
03:51:32,270 --> 03:51:33,310
Why would you do that to us?

6100
03:51:34,670 --> 03:51:36,490
No, it's definitely 9710.

6101
03:51:36,690 --> 03:51:37,530
Go ahead and join up.

6102
03:51:37,590 --> 03:51:38,110
Yeah, yeah.

6103
03:51:38,230 --> 03:51:38,670
Definitely.

6104
03:51:39,350 --> 03:51:40,890
Imagine just one digit off.

6105
03:51:41,270 --> 03:51:42,770
And get 9712.

6106
03:51:43,830 --> 03:51:45,550
Guys, when you join...

6107
03:51:46,030 --> 03:51:49,210
When you join the lobby, the code is right there.

6108
03:51:49,970 --> 03:51:50,950
Oh yeah, it is.

6109
03:51:51,130 --> 03:51:51,870
Oh my god.

6110
03:51:52,210 --> 03:51:53,110
Wait, really?

6111
03:51:53,310 --> 03:51:54,150
Wait, it is.

6112
03:51:55,050 --> 03:51:56,090
Oh, it's a cloud, man.

6113
03:51:56,210 --> 03:51:56,690
Okay, okay.

6114
03:51:57,050 --> 03:51:57,990
We're all clouds.

6115
03:51:58,730 --> 03:52:00,830
That's how you know we're content creator brain.

6116
03:52:00,970 --> 03:52:01,970
That's really good.

6117
03:52:03,730 --> 03:52:04,150
We're all clouds.

6118
03:52:04,150 --> 03:52:05,290
Everyone's like, yeah, make sure there's a code.

6119
03:52:06,730 --> 03:52:09,210
Now we know that Cody was unironically like...

6120
03:52:09,210 --> 03:52:10,970
Yeah, that was such a move, Cody.

6121
03:52:11,510 --> 03:52:12,490
I'm telling the truth, bro.

6122
03:52:12,610 --> 03:52:13,250
I'm telling the truth.

6123
03:52:14,330 --> 03:52:16,850
That's like when I have aces and they're like, you got aces?

6124
03:52:16,850 --> 03:52:17,470
And I'm like, yup.

6125
03:52:17,790 --> 03:52:19,530
I love my fans.

6126
03:52:19,630 --> 03:52:20,590
I want everybody to play.

6127
03:52:21,850 --> 03:52:22,750
Let's all get in here.

6128
03:52:22,750 --> 03:52:25,130
Oh yeah, let's join our room right now.

6129
03:52:25,290 --> 03:52:26,570
Doki, you can't do that.

6130
03:52:26,610 --> 03:52:28,430
You have more viewers than all of us combined.

6131
03:52:28,750 --> 03:52:29,770
You can't do that.

6132
03:52:30,650 --> 03:52:32,070
Wait, I want to be included.

6133
03:52:32,710 --> 03:52:35,030
No, my viewers get it.

6134
03:52:35,070 --> 03:52:36,010
Your viewers don't.

6135
03:52:36,010 --> 03:52:38,150
You have like 5,000 people in there.

6136
03:52:38,310 --> 03:52:39,210
You're not the same.

6137
03:52:40,770 --> 03:52:43,250
You have 5,000 people watching you.

6138
03:52:44,290 --> 03:52:46,010
My viewers are respectable.

6139
03:52:46,890 --> 03:52:48,610
Guys, join my lobby right now.

6140
03:52:49,090 --> 03:52:51,850
I bet your viewers are not respectable and are poor.

6141
03:52:51,950 --> 03:52:52,710
But don't do it.

6142
03:52:52,750 --> 03:52:54,750
I'm gonna go into my stream and drop a Twitch Prime or a tier 1.

6143
03:52:54,890 --> 03:52:55,870
They got no money.

6144
03:52:56,070 --> 03:52:57,090
They got no money.

6145
03:52:57,190 --> 03:52:58,010
They're not subbing to me.

6146
03:52:58,270 --> 03:53:00,330
They don't got it like that.

6147
03:53:00,490 --> 03:53:01,690
Hey, Koni's chat.

6148
03:53:01,810 --> 03:53:02,890
I also have a Twitch too.

6149
03:53:03,050 --> 03:53:04,490
It's at DokiBread on Twitch.

6150
03:53:04,570 --> 03:53:06,770
And you can drop me a sub there.

6151
03:53:06,910 --> 03:53:07,350
Game's starting!

6152
03:53:07,350 --> 03:53:07,690
Game's starting!

6153
03:53:07,810 --> 03:53:08,350
You gotta focus!

6154
03:53:08,670 --> 03:53:09,970
You're about to play!

6155
03:53:10,790 --> 03:53:11,710
You gotta focus!

6156
03:53:12,250 --> 03:53:13,350
I never focus.

6157
03:53:13,350 --> 03:53:14,890
It costs no money whatsoever.

6158
03:53:16,390 --> 03:53:17,530
Everyone just chilling.

6159
03:53:19,650 --> 03:53:22,730
Everyone opening the jacket full of their potions and things to say.

6160
03:53:22,750 --> 03:53:26,210
Everyone just chilling.

6161
03:53:26,350 --> 03:53:29,150
Yo, go drop those subs!

6162
03:53:29,170 --> 03:53:29,270
Yo, go drop those subs!

6163
03:53:32,350 --> 03:53:34,090
The King here.

6164
03:53:34,490 --> 03:53:36,050
It's always queuing.

6165
03:53:36,170 --> 03:53:37,030
Double King!

6166
03:53:37,570 --> 03:53:39,790
Wait, who's higher?

6167
03:53:39,790 --> 03:53:41,230
He's higher than me!

6168
03:53:43,330 --> 03:53:45,350
Oh my god, he's licking the cup!

6169
03:53:45,350 --> 03:53:46,770
Oh my god, he's licking the cup!

6170
03:53:46,830 --> 03:53:48,550
I'm gonna get distracted!

6171
03:53:49,670 --> 03:53:51,890
I'm gonna get distracted!

6172
03:53:52,750 --> 03:53:54,150
I saw a Charlie moment.

6173
03:53:55,330 --> 03:53:56,310
You saw what?

6174
03:53:56,850 --> 03:53:57,710
Wait, what?

6175
03:53:58,590 --> 03:54:00,030
Oh my god, Koba, you're king!

6176
03:54:00,230 --> 03:54:01,330
I'm getting distracted!

6177
03:54:04,650 --> 03:54:05,530
Getting distracted?

6178
03:54:06,030 --> 03:54:06,270
Yeah!

6179
03:54:06,950 --> 03:54:08,190
How am I supposed to focus?

6180
03:54:08,890 --> 03:54:10,510
I can't keep looking down without you.

6181
03:54:10,750 --> 03:54:11,630
Bro, I keep...

6182
03:54:11,630 --> 03:54:13,790
Bro, look at his pecs though.

6183
03:54:14,510 --> 03:54:15,570
He's like a Ken doll.

6184
03:54:15,870 --> 03:54:16,510
It's fine.

6185
03:54:16,710 --> 03:54:18,650
Wait, how would you know?

6186
03:54:18,710 --> 03:54:20,350
Have you seen what's underneath there?

6187
03:54:21,350 --> 03:54:22,310
How do you know?

6188
03:54:22,810 --> 03:54:24,030
I think it's my legs.

6189
03:54:24,270 --> 03:54:25,690
Don't keep focusing on the map!

6190
03:54:26,990 --> 03:54:27,790
What do you mean?

6191
03:54:28,010 --> 03:54:29,230
I am focusing!

6192
03:54:30,630 --> 03:54:32,270
You are winning quite a lot.

6193
03:54:32,610 --> 03:54:34,790
I can tell which one is you because you have clothes.

6194
03:54:38,170 --> 03:54:40,350
Fuck, okay, I'm not focusing anymore, guys.

6195
03:54:40,510 --> 03:54:42,870
This thing is naked in the middle of Times Square!

6196
03:54:43,450 --> 03:54:44,630
Oh my god, this is fucking Disney!

6197
03:54:44,630 --> 03:54:46,770
There are one of these in my life with...

6198
03:54:46,770 --> 03:54:48,250
Okay, alright, coach.

6199
03:54:48,330 --> 03:54:49,150
You gotta tell them.

6200
03:54:50,350 --> 03:54:51,370
We're gonna have to talk to the coach.

6201
03:54:51,530 --> 03:54:55,870
If I tell her press 1 or 2, then she'll stop playing and look at the controller for 5 seconds.

6202
03:54:55,870 --> 03:54:56,710
That is not true!

6203
03:54:57,390 --> 03:54:59,450
That is absolutely not true!

6204
03:55:00,230 --> 03:55:01,930
So I don't want to mess you up?

6205
03:55:02,150 --> 03:55:02,730
There's one!

6206
03:55:04,070 --> 03:55:05,710
That's how it is!

6207
03:55:06,350 --> 03:55:06,790
Stop!

6208
03:55:06,950 --> 03:55:08,790
Now I'm actually looking at the controller!

6209
03:55:09,950 --> 03:55:10,490
Don't look!

6210
03:55:10,670 --> 03:55:11,730
Oh my god, I'm winning!

6211
03:55:13,830 --> 03:55:16,930
Oh my god, you're messing with my groove!

6212
03:55:17,010 --> 03:55:17,710
Oh my god, double jab combo!

6213
03:55:20,350 --> 03:55:21,550
You guys are messing with my groove!

6214
03:55:23,170 --> 03:55:24,250
No more jabs!

6215
03:55:24,410 --> 03:55:25,570
I'm gonna be very serious!

6216
03:55:26,050 --> 03:55:27,090
Is this a serious time?

6217
03:55:27,650 --> 03:55:30,730
No, but then if I'm serious, then I'm gonna think!

6218
03:55:30,770 --> 03:55:30,990
He's focusing!

6219
03:55:31,350 --> 03:55:31,790
Watch this!

6220
03:55:32,630 --> 03:55:33,570
Serious gameplay!

6221
03:55:33,870 --> 03:55:36,070
For serious gamers!

6222
03:55:36,530 --> 03:55:38,090
No, it's so serious!

6223
03:55:38,570 --> 03:55:39,990
Please get away from me!

6224
03:55:43,570 --> 03:55:45,310
The spacing, holy...

6225
03:55:45,310 --> 03:55:47,570
Oh my goodness, talk about movement!

6226
03:55:47,570 --> 03:55:48,130
Good bait!

6227
03:55:49,210 --> 03:55:49,730
Nice!

6228
03:55:51,550 --> 03:55:53,270
Great poi king gameplay!

6229
03:55:53,590 --> 03:55:54,150
Look at that!

6230
03:55:54,930 --> 03:55:56,310
I told you!

6231
03:55:56,510 --> 03:55:58,570
The less I focus, the better I do!

6232
03:55:58,850 --> 03:55:58,990
Stajam's chat is like, Oh!

6233
03:56:02,570 --> 03:56:05,070
You guys didn't see Doki KBD just then?

6234
03:56:05,190 --> 03:56:06,290
I saw it, the spacing was crazy!

6235
03:56:06,790 --> 03:56:09,450
Bro, that was totally intentional too!

6236
03:56:10,510 --> 03:56:11,230
I think?

6237
03:56:11,450 --> 03:56:13,870
I don't know, I don't think when I'm playing sometimes.

6238
03:56:14,250 --> 03:56:15,310
Is that noticeable?

6239
03:56:16,090 --> 03:56:16,610
Instinct!

6240
03:56:18,770 --> 03:56:20,170
That just means you're a gamer.

6241
03:56:20,370 --> 03:56:21,670
Oh god, don't!

6242
03:56:21,770 --> 03:56:22,470
You're jinxing me guys!

6243
03:56:22,690 --> 03:56:24,110
Now I'm starting to think again!

6244
03:56:24,370 --> 03:56:25,150
This is bad!

6245
03:56:26,830 --> 03:56:27,270
Oh!

6246
03:56:27,270 --> 03:56:28,070
She's a king!

6247
03:56:28,090 --> 03:56:29,030
It's like she's a king player!

6248
03:56:30,930 --> 03:56:32,910
But she's not that much of a...

6249
03:56:32,910 --> 03:56:33,810
The amount of shunning with this!

6250
03:56:35,130 --> 03:56:36,010
Oh no!

6251
03:56:36,650 --> 03:56:37,410
It's cool, you're alive?

6252
03:56:37,630 --> 03:56:40,490
I dropped the elbow on the foot!

6253
03:56:40,550 --> 03:56:40,970
Ouch!

6254
03:56:42,610 --> 03:56:43,050
Fight!

6255
03:56:44,830 --> 03:56:46,510
It's like she knows, it's weird.

6256
03:56:48,490 --> 03:56:49,170
Oh my god!

6257
03:56:49,410 --> 03:56:50,010
God damn!

6258
03:56:52,810 --> 03:56:53,410
Hit that!

6259
03:56:53,690 --> 03:56:54,510
Oh no!

6260
03:56:56,090 --> 03:56:56,650
It's fine.

6261
03:56:57,030 --> 03:56:59,310
Oh no, she does that thing that you told me about!

6262
03:56:59,470 --> 03:57:00,430
Like my one move.

6263
03:57:01,270 --> 03:57:02,110
Does she duck though?

6264
03:57:02,170 --> 03:57:02,770
Oh she does.

6265
03:57:06,670 --> 03:57:07,930
Wait, you can do that?

6266
03:57:08,010 --> 03:57:08,570
What the god?

6267
03:57:10,530 --> 03:57:11,450
That's a mis- Explain!

6268
03:57:12,750 --> 03:57:13,590
Explain, coach!

6269
03:57:13,590 --> 03:57:14,690
Oh the donkey!

6270
03:57:14,730 --> 03:57:15,250
Oh!

6271
03:57:17,350 --> 03:57:17,870
Great!

6272
03:57:17,990 --> 03:57:19,190
I do!

6273
03:57:19,810 --> 03:57:22,570
Alright, run up and check this out.

6274
03:57:22,670 --> 03:57:23,270
Shining wizard.

6275
03:57:23,570 --> 03:57:25,370
Wait, what's shining wizard again?

6276
03:57:25,650 --> 03:57:26,090
The running grab!

6277
03:57:26,450 --> 03:57:27,590
The running grab!

6278
03:57:27,710 --> 03:57:28,650
Okay, okay, okay!

6279
03:57:28,910 --> 03:57:29,330
The tomahawk!

6280
03:57:31,450 --> 03:57:32,730
Where was it?

6281
03:57:32,770 --> 03:57:33,310
Where was it?

6282
03:57:35,350 --> 03:57:38,150
Looking on the giant channel of all the buttons.

6283
03:57:41,610 --> 03:57:42,590
Oh, she blocked!

6284
03:57:43,750 --> 03:57:47,550
You gotta press 1, x, or square.

6285
03:57:47,650 --> 03:57:49,230
I need to fucking stop doing that.

6286
03:57:49,590 --> 03:57:50,090
No!

6287
03:57:52,070 --> 03:57:54,890
Guys, the more I start thinking, the worse I'm doing.

6288
03:57:55,090 --> 03:57:55,750
I feel like.

6289
03:57:56,030 --> 03:57:56,850
Look at King's nipples.

6290
03:57:58,190 --> 03:58:00,710
I was doing better when I was distracted.

6291
03:58:02,190 --> 03:58:03,010
Oh no!

6292
03:58:03,130 --> 03:58:03,630
Good break!

6293
03:58:03,830 --> 03:58:04,170
Oh!

6294
03:58:04,210 --> 03:58:04,710
Okay!

6295
03:58:04,850 --> 03:58:05,350
Okay!

6296
03:58:06,730 --> 03:58:07,890
Did I hit that?

6297
03:58:07,990 --> 03:58:08,550
That's crazy!

6298
03:58:08,750 --> 03:58:09,090
No!

6299
03:58:09,230 --> 03:58:10,250
Watch your run!

6300
03:58:11,830 --> 03:58:13,010
Try, now try, now try.

6301
03:58:13,710 --> 03:58:15,070
Alright, nice try, nice try.

6302
03:58:15,990 --> 03:58:18,210
Okay, I need to turn my brain off again.

6303
03:58:19,470 --> 03:58:21,010
He just can't be Natty.

6304
03:58:21,090 --> 03:58:22,310
Look at how vascular he looks.

6305
03:58:22,310 --> 03:58:22,870
I can't!

6306
03:58:22,870 --> 03:58:24,070
It's just so distracting!

6307
03:58:25,070 --> 03:58:26,330
I know that back looks crazy.

6308
03:58:26,330 --> 03:58:26,790
It's like all there.

6309
03:58:27,790 --> 03:58:29,230
Like one of those places is pimply.

6310
03:58:29,230 --> 03:58:29,910
I'll be a bit lower.

6311
03:58:30,710 --> 03:58:31,590
Round 1.

6312
03:58:32,910 --> 03:58:33,350
Fight!

6313
03:58:36,250 --> 03:58:36,690
Okay.

6314
03:58:37,210 --> 03:58:37,650
Nice!

6315
03:58:38,570 --> 03:58:41,130
Oh, no she did that thing that you taught me.

6316
03:58:41,130 --> 03:58:42,690
She is like 2.

6317
03:58:43,090 --> 03:58:45,510
Yeah, She is copying my moves.

6318
03:58:45,810 --> 03:58:48,330
You can dunk that remember when she runs at you.

6319
03:58:48,510 --> 03:58:48,770
Yes.

6320
03:58:48,770 --> 03:58:49,230
Yeah.

6321
03:58:50,750 --> 03:58:56,210
ioou L and N Oh, unlucky.

6322
03:58:56,610 --> 03:58:57,130
Oh!

6323
03:58:57,430 --> 03:58:58,090
What the fuck?

6324
03:58:58,250 --> 03:58:59,610
What the fuck?

6325
03:58:59,930 --> 03:59:01,550
It's like she awkward king player.

6326
03:59:03,190 --> 03:59:03,710
Nice!

6327
03:59:03,730 --> 03:59:04,010
Nice!

6328
03:59:04,010 --> 03:59:04,490
You want a time?

6329
03:59:05,050 --> 03:59:06,970
Hey, did I get that?

6330
03:59:06,970 --> 03:59:07,690
I did it.

6331
03:59:07,750 --> 03:59:07,990
Oh yeah.

6332
03:59:07,990 --> 03:59:10,290
Did I get that too?

6333
03:59:10,550 --> 03:59:11,110
Of course.

6334
03:59:11,130 --> 03:59:12,210
Oh my goodness!

6335
03:59:12,690 --> 03:59:13,110
Genius.

6336
03:59:14,590 --> 03:59:17,550
The level of mind games that are being played right now, I have no idea.

6337
03:59:18,430 --> 03:59:19,010
That's huge.

6338
03:59:19,910 --> 03:59:22,230
And it hurts more because he doesn't have close-up.

6339
03:59:22,290 --> 03:59:23,250
Yeah, that's true.

6340
03:59:23,330 --> 03:59:24,230
There's no padding.

6341
03:59:24,910 --> 03:59:26,270
There's no padding for her.

6342
03:59:27,590 --> 03:59:28,390
Oh no.

6343
03:59:31,850 --> 03:59:32,330
Nice.

6344
03:59:34,430 --> 03:59:35,390
Oh what?

6345
03:59:35,510 --> 03:59:36,290
She predicted me!

6346
03:59:37,210 --> 03:59:38,470
Remember you have to do the...

6347
03:59:38,470 --> 03:59:39,590
square.

6348
03:59:39,590 --> 03:59:40,450
That's your mid.

6349
03:59:40,630 --> 03:59:41,250
That's my mid.

6350
03:59:42,990 --> 03:59:45,210
I'm trying to explain properly.

6351
03:59:47,270 --> 03:59:48,230
The square.

6352
03:59:48,310 --> 03:59:50,190
Hold square right now.

6353
03:59:50,190 --> 03:59:51,830
Okay, I'm holding.

6354
03:59:51,970 --> 03:59:52,390
I'm holding.

6355
03:59:53,110 --> 03:59:53,890
I'm holding.

6356
03:59:54,530 --> 03:59:55,670
There I did it.

6357
03:59:55,670 --> 03:59:56,990
That's what I'm talking about.

6358
03:59:57,190 --> 03:59:59,450
Oh my god.

6359
03:59:59,450 --> 04:00:00,170
I did it.

6360
04:00:00,370 --> 04:00:04,330
No, she fucking punches me in the nut and it hurts.

6361
04:00:04,690 --> 04:00:05,270
Yeah.

6362
04:00:05,470 --> 04:00:07,070
Because I have balls now.

6363
04:00:08,510 --> 04:00:10,430
The 4-4 neutral 2, Doki.

6364
04:00:10,570 --> 04:00:11,770
I don't know if you forgot about it.

6365
04:00:12,330 --> 04:00:12,910
Forgot what?

6366
04:00:13,510 --> 04:00:14,590
4-4 neutral 2.

6367
04:00:14,690 --> 04:00:15,950
That low she keeps hitting you with.

6368
04:00:18,530 --> 04:00:19,610
Oh fuck, 10 strings.

6369
04:00:20,610 --> 04:00:21,750
Oh my god.

6370
04:00:22,110 --> 04:00:23,070
You thought it was friendly.

6371
04:00:23,150 --> 04:00:23,670
We're doing strings.

6372
04:00:25,510 --> 04:00:26,630
Square, square, square, square.

6373
04:00:26,890 --> 04:00:27,370
Oh, never mind.

6374
04:00:27,490 --> 04:00:27,850
It's okay.

6375
04:00:27,890 --> 04:00:28,450
I didn't need it.

6376
04:00:29,050 --> 04:00:29,430
Okay.

6377
04:00:30,010 --> 04:00:31,030
I didn't need it.

6378
04:00:31,890 --> 04:00:32,470
It's okay.

6379
04:00:32,550 --> 04:00:33,250
I didn't need it.

6380
04:00:33,350 --> 04:00:36,110
This is the best matchup I've ever watched in my life.

6381
04:00:36,350 --> 04:00:37,350
That question.

6382
04:00:40,170 --> 04:00:41,590
I've never seen anything better.

6383
04:00:43,350 --> 04:00:44,270
What the fuck?

6384
04:00:44,330 --> 04:00:45,250
She bit my balls.

6385
04:00:46,270 --> 04:00:46,750
What?

6386
04:00:47,830 --> 04:00:49,410
She bit my balls.

6387
04:00:49,610 --> 04:00:50,290
How is that legal?

6388
04:00:51,490 --> 04:00:52,170
It's not.

6389
04:00:52,650 --> 04:00:53,890
Square, square, square, square.

6390
04:00:54,090 --> 04:00:54,650
I did it.

6391
04:00:55,470 --> 04:00:56,430
I learned.

6392
04:00:58,450 --> 04:00:59,890
Oh my god.

6393
04:00:59,910 --> 04:01:01,310
It's like I can learn.

6394
04:01:01,730 --> 04:01:01,770
Oh my god.

6395
04:01:01,770 --> 04:01:01,770
It's like I can learn.

6396
04:01:02,710 --> 04:01:03,430
Oh my god.

6397
04:01:03,430 --> 04:01:03,550
It's like I can learn.

6398
04:01:03,550 --> 04:01:04,070
Good adaptation.

6399
04:01:04,570 --> 04:01:05,050
Okay.

6400
04:01:05,730 --> 04:01:06,210
Nice.

6401
04:01:06,450 --> 04:01:06,870
Nice.

6402
04:01:08,470 --> 04:01:09,670
It's fucking go.

6403
04:01:09,890 --> 04:01:10,290
Yeah.

6404
04:01:11,770 --> 04:01:13,270
She's fucking goaded.

6405
04:01:15,110 --> 04:01:16,490
I did it.

6406
04:01:17,250 --> 04:01:18,970
I beat a Tekken player.

6407
04:01:19,510 --> 04:01:22,190
She's been playing Tekken before I started playing Tekken.

6408
04:01:22,850 --> 04:01:24,510
She's been playing Tekken before I started playing Tekken.

6409
04:01:24,510 --> 04:01:25,070
Oh.

6410
04:01:25,630 --> 04:01:26,250
Oh.

6411
04:01:27,270 --> 04:01:28,450
I'm so beast.

6412
04:01:29,070 --> 04:01:31,970
See, you guys just need to shout the controller icons.

6413
04:01:32,490 --> 04:01:32,510
See, you guys just need to shout the controller icons.

6414
04:01:33,050 --> 04:01:33,870
Yeah, yeah.

6415
04:01:35,130 --> 04:01:38,450
Just order a Uniqlo shirt with a big blue button.

6416
04:01:38,470 --> 04:01:39,510
PlayStation Square.

6417
04:01:40,850 --> 04:01:42,870
It has to be upside down though.

6418
04:01:43,250 --> 04:01:44,350
So she can look down.

6419
04:01:45,290 --> 04:01:46,590
Like impact text.

6420
04:01:46,730 --> 04:01:47,210
Beware.

6421
04:01:49,190 --> 04:01:50,970
Just yell square, square, square.

6422
04:01:52,290 --> 04:01:53,350
We did it.

6423
04:01:53,370 --> 04:01:54,890
I got two matches in.

6424
04:01:55,530 --> 04:01:56,010
Yeah.

6425
04:01:56,370 --> 04:01:57,430
Oh my god.

6426
04:02:00,890 --> 04:02:02,730
This has got to turn off my brain.

6427
04:02:03,410 --> 04:02:03,890
This has got to turn off my brain.

6428
04:02:04,190 --> 04:02:04,670
Yeah.

6429
04:02:04,750 --> 04:02:06,130
You just got to become the king.

6430
04:02:06,130 --> 04:02:06,690
Yeah.

6431
04:02:06,830 --> 04:02:09,170
You have to hit the rage thing.

6432
04:02:10,590 --> 04:02:11,150
Yeah.

6433
04:02:11,370 --> 04:02:12,310
The rage button.

6434
04:02:13,470 --> 04:02:14,510
It's Reyna.

6435
04:02:15,710 --> 04:02:16,270
Okay.

6436
04:02:16,470 --> 04:02:17,070
He got this.

6437
04:02:17,370 --> 04:02:21,470
He matches a lot apparently.

6438
04:02:23,150 --> 04:02:23,710
Well.

6439
04:02:24,270 --> 04:02:26,050
Dick jab will be your best friend.

6440
04:02:27,110 --> 04:02:32,830
Dick jab into giant swing or just back three when he's rushing you maybe.

6441
04:02:33,250 --> 04:02:33,570
Woo.

6442
04:02:36,830 --> 04:02:38,230
I'm going to use the bathroom break.

6443
04:02:38,410 --> 04:02:39,670
I bet you can pull off one set.

6444
04:02:39,850 --> 04:02:40,450
I believe.

6445
04:02:42,250 --> 04:02:43,950
Did you make this picture, Kony?

6446
04:02:44,030 --> 04:02:44,430
I just saw.

6447
04:02:45,190 --> 04:02:45,670
Which one?

6448
04:02:45,710 --> 04:02:47,210
Oh no, Chatter did.

6449
04:02:47,330 --> 04:02:47,850
Thank you, Chatter.

6450
04:02:48,030 --> 04:02:49,210
This is so cool.

6451
04:02:49,310 --> 04:02:50,190
Oh, this shit is chugging.

6452
04:02:51,350 --> 04:02:52,110
Okay, never mind.

6453
04:02:52,150 --> 04:02:52,370
We're good.

6454
04:02:53,490 --> 04:02:54,330
I think we're good.

6455
04:03:01,270 --> 04:03:02,170
No buttons.

6456
04:03:03,110 --> 04:03:04,750
Oh my half life gone.

6457
04:03:10,850 --> 04:03:11,550
Mm-hmm.

6458
04:03:14,230 --> 04:03:15,270
Kitty mode, Reyna.

6459
04:03:16,090 --> 04:03:16,830
Oh my god.

6460
04:03:22,550 --> 04:03:23,030
Wow.

6461
04:03:23,810 --> 04:03:25,230
Come on, Super Mario King.

6462
04:03:25,330 --> 04:03:25,830
I remember this.

6463
04:03:25,830 --> 04:03:25,870
I remember this.

6464
04:03:25,890 --> 04:03:27,370
You have hate, Kony.

6465
04:03:27,450 --> 04:03:27,910
Keep in mind.

6466
04:03:28,550 --> 04:03:28,950
Oops.

6467
04:03:32,900 --> 04:03:33,700
Nice patience.

6468
04:03:33,980 --> 04:03:36,400
Honestly, both of you.

6469
04:03:36,420 --> 04:03:38,120
I was like it's going to be a match fest and it wasn't.

6470
04:03:39,660 --> 04:03:40,060
Fight.

6471
04:03:40,900 --> 04:03:41,300
Ugh.

6472
04:03:43,940 --> 04:03:44,720
Ball, coach.

6473
04:03:46,080 --> 04:03:46,620
Let's go.

6474
04:03:47,120 --> 04:03:48,000
Remember the square.

6475
04:03:50,100 --> 04:03:52,440
Yo, why don't these guys know how to avoid that?

6476
04:03:57,690 --> 04:03:58,090
Yo.

6477
04:03:58,270 --> 04:03:58,610
I'm going to go.

6478
04:03:58,610 --> 04:03:58,870
Oh.

6479
04:04:00,490 --> 04:04:02,090
Let's go keep the King streak alive.

6480
04:04:03,110 --> 04:04:03,530
Fight.

6481
04:04:10,810 --> 04:04:13,210
I know her strength.

6482
04:04:14,670 --> 04:04:16,490
You can hop kick that if you block it.

6483
04:04:16,550 --> 04:04:16,930
Yeah.

6484
04:04:20,890 --> 04:04:21,310
Nice.

6485
04:04:21,470 --> 04:04:21,890
Okay.

6486
04:04:35,580 --> 04:04:36,420
Good duck.

6487
04:04:37,140 --> 04:04:38,080
He's going to duck.

6488
04:04:38,140 --> 04:04:39,360
He's going to duck more than he doesn't, I think.

6489
04:04:39,420 --> 04:04:40,180
In that situation.

6490
04:04:40,540 --> 04:04:42,380
He did.

6491
04:04:42,520 --> 04:04:42,840
Yeah.

6492
04:04:45,760 --> 04:04:46,880
Nice kick.

6493
04:04:50,720 --> 04:04:51,280
Oh.

6494
04:04:51,280 --> 04:04:52,940
Oh my god.

6495
04:04:53,440 --> 04:04:54,000
Fuck.

6496
04:04:54,160 --> 04:04:54,720
Square.

6497
04:05:00,000 --> 04:05:00,700
Got it.

6498
04:05:00,900 --> 04:05:01,460
Nice.

6499
04:05:02,140 --> 04:05:03,480
That's a professional King player.

6500
04:05:08,930 --> 04:05:09,650
Hell yeah.

6501
04:05:12,410 --> 04:05:13,770
Definitely scared of the King grab.

6502
04:05:13,890 --> 04:05:14,370
So ducking.

6503
04:05:17,430 --> 04:05:18,770
What skin is this, Kony?

6504
04:05:19,350 --> 04:05:19,930
It's Mario.

6505
04:05:20,030 --> 04:05:20,330
I don't know.

6506
04:05:20,350 --> 04:05:21,410
I just think he looks cool.

6507
04:05:22,190 --> 04:05:23,350
This is like 1996.

6508
04:05:23,470 --> 04:05:25,390
Yeah, I was going to say it's the 1990s.

6509
04:05:25,390 --> 04:05:26,430
I think he looks cool.

6510
04:05:26,650 --> 04:05:28,410
This is how I look like showing up at Summit.

6511
04:05:28,630 --> 04:05:29,690
This is me at Summit.

6512
04:05:29,830 --> 04:05:30,190
You know that.

6513
04:05:30,210 --> 04:05:30,930
This is your Evo?

6514
04:05:33,190 --> 04:05:34,870
He's got little ear holes with a hat.

6515
04:05:35,530 --> 04:05:36,470
I like the sweatpants.

6516
04:05:36,470 --> 04:05:38,690
I think he actually scrubs out, but it's still cute.

6517
04:05:39,770 --> 04:05:41,590
He looks like a TF2 scout.

6518
04:05:42,050 --> 04:05:42,570
What?

6519
04:05:42,930 --> 04:05:43,970
Oh my damn it.

6520
04:05:43,970 --> 04:05:45,690
I miss TF2 so much, too.

6521
04:05:46,730 --> 04:05:47,970
We have TF2 at home.

6522
04:05:48,070 --> 04:05:48,790
Marvel rivals.

6523
04:05:49,210 --> 04:05:49,870
Oh, yay.

6524
04:05:50,690 --> 04:05:51,390
That's true.

6525
04:05:53,070 --> 04:05:53,890
That's the offense.

6526
04:05:55,910 --> 04:05:57,250
Typical Reyna activity.

6527
04:05:58,030 --> 04:05:58,990
Round two.

6528
04:05:59,930 --> 04:06:00,450
Fight.

6529
04:06:02,390 --> 04:06:04,490
I'm going to try to find more ways to do that.

6530
04:06:04,850 --> 04:06:05,950
He's not ready for it.

6531
04:06:05,950 --> 04:06:09,210
Apparently, SageM and Steve said that's how Coney dresses.

6532
04:06:12,650 --> 04:06:14,010
What a hopkick.

6533
04:06:14,350 --> 04:06:16,130
What the fuck did that hopkick feel like?

6534
04:06:17,030 --> 04:06:18,930
One day I'll be able to do a hopkick.

6535
04:06:20,390 --> 04:06:21,590
Just like my coach.

6536
04:06:23,570 --> 04:06:24,530
Coach Coney.

6537
04:06:24,710 --> 04:06:25,850
Coach Coney, let's go.

6538
04:06:26,010 --> 04:06:26,510
Coach Coney, let's go.

6539
04:06:26,510 --> 04:06:26,610
He's just bullying.

6540
04:06:27,170 --> 04:06:29,270
Who grows a shoe, honestly?

6541
04:06:29,890 --> 04:06:30,950
Round three.

6542
04:06:31,910 --> 04:06:32,470
Fight.

6543
04:06:33,610 --> 04:06:34,570
Oh, that's a...

6544
04:06:36,650 --> 04:06:37,690
I thought that was a low.

6545
04:06:37,850 --> 04:06:38,750
But she did the duck.

6546
04:06:41,190 --> 04:06:45,290
Oh my god.

6547
04:06:49,540 --> 04:06:50,920
Reyna just got to hold back there.

6548
04:06:51,720 --> 04:06:52,620
You just have to block.

6549
04:06:54,200 --> 04:06:54,560
Okay.

6550
04:06:59,000 --> 04:06:59,360
Wow.

6551
04:07:00,100 --> 04:07:00,460
Oh.

6552
04:07:02,600 --> 04:07:02,960
Nice.

6553
04:07:03,280 --> 04:07:03,760
Good duck.

6554
04:07:03,840 --> 04:07:04,220
Good duck.

6555
04:07:06,040 --> 04:07:06,520
That's fair.

6556
04:07:06,620 --> 04:07:06,940
That's fair.

6557
04:07:07,600 --> 04:07:07,760
He's ready now.

6558
04:07:09,140 --> 04:07:09,580
Fight.

6559
04:07:11,580 --> 04:07:13,060
Okay, just ducking all the time.

6560
04:07:13,220 --> 04:07:13,660
Yeah.

6561
04:07:13,660 --> 04:07:14,960
That was just hopkicks.

6562
04:07:15,140 --> 04:07:15,360
Okay.

6563
04:07:19,580 --> 04:07:20,280
He's scared.

6564
04:07:20,540 --> 04:07:20,980
Yeah.

6565
04:07:23,620 --> 04:07:24,860
I mean, mixture exists.

6566
04:07:25,040 --> 04:07:26,020
Yeah, that happens.

6567
04:07:28,480 --> 04:07:29,040
It's okay.

6568
04:07:29,140 --> 04:07:30,040
We have another set.

6569
04:07:30,120 --> 04:07:30,800
The combos are crazy.

6570
04:07:30,940 --> 04:07:32,100
I hate this level, man.

6571
04:07:32,200 --> 04:07:32,540
Fuck.

6572
04:07:33,440 --> 04:07:33,880
Okay.

6573
04:07:34,860 --> 04:07:35,700
One more set.

6574
04:07:35,780 --> 04:07:36,480
Oh, he won from the ducks.

6575
04:07:36,480 --> 04:07:36,700
Yeah.

6576
04:07:37,320 --> 04:07:39,380
If you lost, couldn't you switch stage?

6577
04:07:40,100 --> 04:07:42,640
You can if you pick random if you want.

6578
04:07:43,700 --> 04:07:44,440
Oh, no.

6579
04:07:44,440 --> 04:07:44,980
We all just fine.

6580
04:07:46,040 --> 04:07:46,880
We ball.

6581
04:07:46,940 --> 04:07:47,160
We ball.

6582
04:07:47,700 --> 04:07:48,120
Fight.

6583
04:07:50,560 --> 04:07:52,080
Oh, what a quest, dude.

6584
04:07:52,260 --> 04:07:54,160
Remember, if you block, don't launch it.

6585
04:07:57,380 --> 04:07:58,020
That's funny.

6586
04:07:58,200 --> 04:07:58,740
It's just hopkicks.

6587
04:07:59,200 --> 04:07:59,620
Yeah.

6588
04:07:59,800 --> 04:08:00,180
No.

6589
04:08:00,260 --> 04:08:01,260
He'll duck every time now.

6590
04:08:01,580 --> 04:08:02,340
We know this.

6591
04:08:02,340 --> 04:08:02,820
Yeah.

6592
04:08:02,960 --> 04:08:04,080
We gotta keep Dwanas.

6593
04:08:04,140 --> 04:08:04,600
There you go.

6594
04:08:06,020 --> 04:08:06,580
Nice.

6595
04:08:11,860 --> 04:08:12,920
Press the little button.

6596
04:08:14,600 --> 04:08:15,460
Oh, nice.

6597
04:08:15,780 --> 04:08:16,440
Fuck, dude.

6598
04:08:19,380 --> 04:08:20,420
Oh, my God.

6599
04:08:20,460 --> 04:08:20,820
Yes.

6600
04:08:20,860 --> 04:08:23,200
That was insane.

6601
04:08:23,480 --> 04:08:23,760
Alley kick.

6602
04:08:23,940 --> 04:08:24,400
Alley kick.

6603
04:08:24,480 --> 04:08:24,780
Okay.

6604
04:08:24,780 --> 04:08:25,520
Oh, Jesus.

6605
04:08:25,680 --> 04:08:26,240
Rage.

6606
04:08:26,520 --> 04:08:27,380
Done deal.

6607
04:08:28,940 --> 04:08:29,500
Fight.

6608
04:08:31,740 --> 04:08:32,780
Nice nut shot.

6609
04:08:34,400 --> 04:08:36,940
Every time she does that, I'm like, okay, that's a low.

6610
04:08:37,280 --> 04:08:39,280
No, it's gonna be a mid every time.

6611
04:08:39,360 --> 04:08:39,500
Yeah.

6612
04:08:40,800 --> 04:08:42,620
He's doing it over and over, man.

6613
04:08:42,740 --> 04:08:44,040
It's the same fucking thing.

6614
04:08:44,820 --> 04:08:45,220
Fuck.

6615
04:08:47,620 --> 04:08:48,780
Dude, that didn't hit.

6616
04:08:49,620 --> 04:08:50,900
I keep thinking it's low.

6617
04:08:51,080 --> 04:08:51,760
Like, I'm going low.

6618
04:08:52,120 --> 04:08:53,120
She's just hitting mid.

6619
04:08:53,280 --> 04:08:53,480
Yeah.

6620
04:08:58,020 --> 04:08:58,780
That... okay.

6621
04:08:58,900 --> 04:08:59,660
I tried to grab.

6622
04:09:00,860 --> 04:09:03,840
You can also Rage Yard if they're being like that at the corner.

6623
04:09:03,980 --> 04:09:05,120
Rage Yard is very valid.

6624
04:09:05,820 --> 04:09:05,920
Oh.

6625
04:09:06,800 --> 04:09:07,780
That block.

6626
04:09:10,220 --> 04:09:12,000
Dude, they should have pressed there.

6627
04:09:13,260 --> 04:09:14,220
Fuck, man.

6628
04:09:23,850 --> 04:09:24,450
Nice.

6629
04:09:30,730 --> 04:09:33,050
What a fucking follow-up.

6630
04:09:34,310 --> 04:09:35,010
That's it.

6631
04:09:36,210 --> 04:09:37,030
What a combo.

6632
04:09:37,230 --> 04:09:37,830
Nice.

6633
04:09:38,370 --> 04:09:39,410
What a grab.

6634
04:09:42,370 --> 04:09:43,770
Get into your head.

6635
04:09:44,170 --> 04:09:44,770
Get into your head.

6636
04:09:45,510 --> 04:09:46,590
Get into your head.

6637
04:09:46,590 --> 04:09:47,610
Oh.

6638
04:09:47,830 --> 04:09:48,730
Guard break.

6639
04:09:49,130 --> 04:09:50,690
What the fuck was that?

6640
04:09:57,650 --> 04:09:58,590
Oh, nice.

6641
04:10:00,230 --> 04:10:01,050
Get it all.

6642
04:10:01,750 --> 04:10:02,670
Get it all, man.

6643
04:10:04,330 --> 04:10:05,690
That was crazy.

6644
04:10:05,990 --> 04:10:06,590
That was weird.

6645
04:10:06,690 --> 04:10:08,870
I didn't mean to do that parry.

6646
04:10:08,950 --> 04:10:09,870
I tried to do back three.

6647
04:10:10,850 --> 04:10:12,230
Just Rage Yard there.

6648
04:10:13,170 --> 04:10:13,690
Dude.

6649
04:10:17,010 --> 04:10:17,770
Hopkick out.

6650
04:10:17,770 --> 04:10:18,630
You hit her?

6651
04:10:19,230 --> 04:10:20,130
You hit her?

6652
04:10:20,350 --> 04:10:20,850
Just hopkick.

6653
04:10:21,090 --> 04:10:21,250
Yeah.

6654
04:10:24,470 --> 04:10:25,670
Trying to do back out.

6655
04:10:25,950 --> 04:10:26,890
Playing frustrated.

6656
04:10:27,750 --> 04:10:28,670
Yeah, that's alright.

6657
04:10:29,070 --> 04:10:29,670
Locking, locking.

6658
04:10:32,530 --> 04:10:34,050
This guy is just one thing.

6659
04:10:34,350 --> 04:10:34,790
It's okay.

6660
04:10:34,890 --> 04:10:37,250
Now that you know that, you can use it for next time.

6661
04:10:37,790 --> 04:10:39,870
For the one with more points.

6662
04:10:41,550 --> 04:10:41,990
Yeah.

6663
04:10:42,050 --> 04:10:43,030
I just need more time.

6664
04:10:43,170 --> 04:10:44,910
I thought, I kept thinking it would change.

6665
04:10:44,910 --> 04:10:46,550
It's just one fucking thing over and over.

6666
04:10:46,770 --> 04:10:47,130
Okay.

6667
04:10:47,230 --> 04:10:47,550
Alright.

6668
04:10:48,310 --> 04:10:48,790
It's cool.

6669
04:10:48,870 --> 04:10:49,150
It's cool.

6670
04:10:50,830 --> 04:10:51,650
Doki won, right?

6671
04:10:51,830 --> 04:10:52,770
Yeah, I won.

6672
04:10:53,690 --> 04:10:55,190
You forgot I won?

6673
04:10:55,270 --> 04:10:56,610
That was some hype shit.

6674
04:10:57,610 --> 04:10:57,970
No, I am.

6675
04:10:57,970 --> 04:10:58,650
No, it was hype.

6676
04:10:58,690 --> 04:10:59,650
I just wanted to make sure.

6677
04:10:59,790 --> 04:11:02,170
You just wanted to make sure it wasn't a fluke.

6678
04:11:07,630 --> 04:11:08,950
What are you playing against?

6679
04:11:10,010 --> 04:11:10,650
Oh, shit.

6680
04:11:10,730 --> 04:11:11,570
I played this guy yesterday.

6681
04:11:12,890 --> 04:11:13,630
Didn't you win?

6682
04:11:13,790 --> 04:11:14,310
You made like a comeback.

6683
04:11:14,990 --> 04:11:18,430
But I think it was definitely matchup gap for him.

6684
04:11:18,890 --> 04:11:21,150
And I think he probably is coming correct.

6685
04:11:23,110 --> 04:11:23,690
That's okay.

6686
04:11:23,750 --> 04:11:27,570
If he wins, then it will be the same story, but like the other way.

6687
04:11:27,810 --> 04:11:31,070
If he silently enters me, I will be in trouble.

6688
04:11:31,450 --> 04:11:32,370
For real?

6689
04:11:33,590 --> 04:11:35,650
You come back one to challenge it if you want.

6690
04:11:35,750 --> 04:11:39,370
If he hits you into it, then just eat the mix.

6691
04:11:39,790 --> 04:11:41,090
The mid, it heat engages.

6692
04:11:41,250 --> 04:11:44,150
The low, just leads into another mix.

6693
04:11:45,830 --> 04:11:49,030
If he dynamically enters me, I think I will be okay.

6694
04:11:49,610 --> 04:11:50,990
That's not how I was working it.

6695
04:11:51,830 --> 04:11:52,390
Why?

6696
04:11:52,790 --> 04:11:53,310
That's what it is.

6697
04:11:53,330 --> 04:11:55,170
Dynamic entry and silent entry.

6698
04:11:57,530 --> 04:11:58,570
Yeah, you are right.

6699
04:11:58,750 --> 04:12:01,090
Either way, I am getting entered.

6700
04:12:01,990 --> 04:12:07,030
Well, do running 1 plus 2s into the hunting bear grab or anything.

6701
04:12:08,950 --> 04:12:09,970
Condition this man.

6702
04:12:10,870 --> 04:12:11,710
Oh, God.

6703
04:12:11,950 --> 04:12:12,650
Oh, my God.

6704
04:12:12,650 --> 04:12:13,330
Oh, my God.

6705
04:12:13,370 --> 04:12:14,190
He is naked too.

6706
04:12:15,270 --> 04:12:16,790
Don't get distracted like me.

6707
04:12:17,010 --> 04:12:18,430
Is that Shadow the hedgehog?

6708
04:12:18,430 --> 04:12:18,830
No way.

6709
04:12:18,870 --> 04:12:19,570
I think it is.

6710
04:12:19,710 --> 04:12:21,170
His Sonic is the other one.

6711
04:12:21,810 --> 04:12:22,730
Oh, my God.

6712
04:12:22,730 --> 04:12:23,110
It's Shadow.

6713
04:12:23,110 --> 04:12:24,590
He was Shadow last time I thought.

6714
04:12:24,790 --> 04:12:25,590
Or no, he was Sonic.

6715
04:12:25,730 --> 04:12:28,830
Wow, he is breaking doubles.

6716
04:12:29,210 --> 04:12:31,250
Oh, we can't break that.

6717
04:12:35,330 --> 04:12:35,990
Be careful.

6718
04:12:36,070 --> 04:12:36,810
He might bring a gun.

6719
04:12:37,070 --> 04:12:38,070
Holy fuck.

6720
04:12:39,310 --> 04:12:40,310
What a kick.

6721
04:12:41,690 --> 04:12:42,530
Good grab.

6722
04:12:42,970 --> 04:12:43,390
Oh.

6723
04:12:45,490 --> 04:12:46,230
Nice block.

6724
04:12:46,530 --> 04:12:46,930
Oh, nice.

6725
04:12:47,290 --> 04:12:49,210
I am playing autopilot.

6726
04:12:49,290 --> 04:12:50,190
I need to fucking lock in.

6727
04:12:50,310 --> 04:12:51,510
That was sloppy as shit.

6728
04:12:51,810 --> 04:12:52,350
Let's go.

6729
04:12:52,570 --> 04:12:54,410
I think he is also autopiloting a little bit.

6730
04:13:02,030 --> 04:13:03,470
A primitive mix up.

6731
04:13:07,430 --> 04:13:09,590
You can forward 2-1 that launcher he is trying.

6732
04:13:10,070 --> 04:13:10,490
Okay.

6733
04:13:12,150 --> 04:13:12,570
Oh.

6734
04:13:12,990 --> 04:13:13,650
Oh, my God.

6735
04:13:13,850 --> 04:13:14,950
That was close.

6736
04:13:15,170 --> 04:13:16,670
That was a close twin piston.

6737
04:13:17,730 --> 04:13:18,710
Lock in.

6738
04:13:26,560 --> 04:13:27,980
Mix it up.

6739
04:13:34,310 --> 04:13:34,950
Nice.

6740
04:13:36,910 --> 04:13:37,550
Nice.

6741
04:13:37,550 --> 04:13:38,090
Okay.

6742
04:13:40,030 --> 04:13:41,210
Look at that damage.

6743
04:13:44,530 --> 04:13:45,390
Good shit.

6744
04:13:45,550 --> 04:13:45,870
Nice.

6745
04:13:47,990 --> 04:13:49,270
Let's go.

6746
04:13:49,770 --> 04:13:50,250
Nice.

6747
04:13:50,430 --> 04:13:52,090
Oh, I am dead.

6748
04:13:52,790 --> 04:13:53,270
No.

6749
04:13:53,370 --> 04:13:56,010
Remember that.

6750
04:13:56,050 --> 04:13:56,750
That is safe, right?

6751
04:13:58,450 --> 04:14:00,170
Oh, no.

6752
04:14:00,570 --> 04:14:01,890
Not even close.

6753
04:14:03,970 --> 04:14:06,150
I was looking at his health bar.

6754
04:14:06,290 --> 04:14:07,270
Or my health bar, not his.

6755
04:14:07,530 --> 04:14:08,310
Good lord.

6756
04:14:09,850 --> 04:14:10,770
Oh, my God.

6757
04:14:10,890 --> 04:14:12,070
The block, block, block, block.

6758
04:14:17,090 --> 04:14:17,890
Nice, dude.

6759
04:14:17,970 --> 04:14:18,410
Oh, my God.

6760
04:14:18,470 --> 04:14:19,270
Called it too.

6761
04:14:19,630 --> 04:14:21,890
He was not ready for you to take that.

6762
04:14:23,830 --> 04:14:25,110
He hit the whole tank.

6763
04:14:27,690 --> 04:14:28,370
Hell, yeah.

6764
04:14:29,090 --> 04:14:29,490
Nice.

6765
04:14:31,090 --> 04:14:31,490
Oh.

6766
04:14:36,110 --> 04:14:36,770
I got him.

6767
04:14:36,990 --> 04:14:37,390
Yeah.

6768
04:14:37,390 --> 04:14:38,110
Oh, my God.

6769
04:14:38,170 --> 04:14:40,910
You don't even need the delay.

6770
04:14:41,010 --> 04:14:42,270
You don't even need it.

6771
04:14:42,270 --> 04:14:42,990
Woo.

6772
04:14:45,390 --> 04:14:46,230
One more, bro.

6773
04:14:46,330 --> 04:14:46,690
Let's go.

6774
04:14:46,830 --> 04:14:47,310
Let's go.

6775
04:14:54,780 --> 04:14:55,500
We believe.

6776
04:15:00,320 --> 04:15:01,720
Who painted that for him?

6777
04:15:02,880 --> 04:15:04,040
Did he go to a clown?

6778
04:15:05,740 --> 04:15:06,580
What the fuck?

6779
04:15:07,040 --> 04:15:08,140
Yeah, he knows a clown.

6780
04:15:08,280 --> 04:15:09,280
What a quick punch.

6781
04:15:14,410 --> 04:15:14,810
Sick.

6782
04:15:14,950 --> 04:15:15,630
Oh, my God.

6783
04:15:15,630 --> 04:15:16,130
Oh, my God.

6784
04:15:16,750 --> 04:15:17,110
Oh.

6785
04:15:21,130 --> 04:15:21,850
Back up.

6786
04:15:21,870 --> 04:15:22,490
He's going to throw it out.

6787
04:15:24,510 --> 04:15:25,230
Back up.

6788
04:15:25,750 --> 04:15:26,110
Okay.

6789
04:15:26,530 --> 04:15:27,110
Hello, Perry.

6790
04:15:27,630 --> 04:15:28,390
Hello, Perry this.

6791
04:15:31,510 --> 04:15:32,430
Dude, I'm mad.

6792
04:15:33,110 --> 04:15:33,750
Okay, it's fine.

6793
04:15:34,550 --> 04:15:35,810
I could have fucking had that round.

6794
04:15:35,890 --> 04:15:36,270
Let's do it.

6795
04:15:36,290 --> 04:15:37,010
Come on, baby.

6796
04:15:37,250 --> 04:15:37,750
What's up?

6797
04:15:40,110 --> 04:15:40,470
What?

6798
04:15:43,570 --> 04:15:44,810
Literally passed through his body.

6799
04:15:47,730 --> 04:15:48,090
Sorry.

6800
04:15:48,170 --> 04:15:49,310
We just want to give him a little bit.

6801
04:15:49,630 --> 04:15:50,430
Just give him one.

6802
04:15:52,090 --> 04:15:52,650
Oh, nice.

6803
04:15:52,730 --> 04:15:53,150
Yes, sir.

6804
04:15:58,350 --> 04:15:59,490
Oh, lots of damage.

6805
04:16:10,070 --> 04:16:11,470
I'm trying to get too cute, man.

6806
04:16:11,850 --> 04:16:12,330
It's okay.

6807
04:16:12,370 --> 04:16:13,530
We're keeping close for content.

6808
04:16:13,770 --> 04:16:14,150
It's cool.

6809
04:16:14,590 --> 04:16:17,130
We want to pad out the 10 minutes on the YouTube video.

6810
04:16:20,170 --> 04:16:20,530
Nice.

6811
04:16:34,580 --> 04:16:36,040
What the fuck is he doing?

6812
04:16:36,180 --> 04:16:36,280
What the fuck is he doing, man?

6813
04:16:37,220 --> 04:16:38,980
What the fuck is he doing, man?

6814
04:16:38,980 --> 04:16:40,680
It's such a lame fucking character.

6815
04:16:40,860 --> 04:16:41,500
Oh, God.

6816
04:16:41,540 --> 04:16:46,660
Okay, next time you're ever put in rage, I promise you he's not looking for it.

6817
04:16:46,740 --> 04:16:46,760
Okay, next time you're ever put in rage, I promise you he's not looking for it.

6818
04:16:46,760 --> 04:16:47,160
Just smash it.

6819
04:16:47,600 --> 04:16:49,420
Like, you don't even have to think.

6820
04:16:49,800 --> 04:16:52,200
Just mash rage art if you have that red health bar.

6821
04:16:52,320 --> 04:16:53,060
I promise you it'll hit.

6822
04:16:53,700 --> 04:16:57,000
And when you get the wall, you can just do back 2-1 into the butt.

6823
04:16:57,120 --> 04:16:59,240
So you don't have to worry about the delay or anything.

6824
04:16:59,540 --> 04:17:00,580
So you don't have to worry about the delay or anything.

6825
04:17:12,300 --> 04:17:12,860
Oh, nice.

6826
04:17:12,860 --> 04:17:13,460
That's punishable, though.

6827
04:17:14,160 --> 04:17:15,020
Oh, nice.

6828
04:17:15,420 --> 04:17:15,880
Okay.

6829
04:17:30,510 --> 04:17:31,890
Yeah, slap him!

6830
04:17:31,990 --> 04:17:32,370
Okay.

6831
04:17:32,830 --> 04:17:33,630
Juggle him!

6832
04:17:34,310 --> 04:17:34,970
Rage art?

6833
04:17:35,290 --> 04:17:35,850
Nice!

6834
04:17:35,890 --> 04:17:36,430
Oh, it doesn't matter.

6835
04:17:36,450 --> 04:17:36,810
Nice!

6836
04:17:36,810 --> 04:17:37,370
Good shit.

6837
04:17:37,530 --> 04:17:39,890
Save that read for the win.

6838
04:17:42,550 --> 04:17:43,110
Oh!

6839
04:17:46,880 --> 04:17:47,720
Oh!

6840
04:17:48,880 --> 04:17:49,440
Okay.

6841
04:17:51,280 --> 04:17:51,840
Okay.

6842
04:17:55,220 --> 04:17:56,140
Oh, my God.

6843
04:17:56,180 --> 04:17:57,260
Don't stop that combo!

6844
04:17:57,540 --> 04:17:57,940
Oh, my God.

6845
04:17:57,940 --> 04:18:00,660
Oh, my God.

6846
04:18:01,060 --> 04:18:01,180
What was that?

6847
04:18:04,980 --> 04:18:06,440
Okay, he's not wearing shoes.

6848
04:18:06,600 --> 04:18:07,160
It's gonna hurt.

6849
04:18:07,480 --> 04:18:09,060
Who glued him to the wall?

6850
04:18:10,700 --> 04:18:12,480
How's the Tekken 4 ass combo?

6851
04:18:13,160 --> 04:18:13,720
Do that again!

6852
04:18:16,920 --> 04:18:20,520
I am impressed.

6853
04:18:20,740 --> 04:18:21,200
I'm mad.

6854
04:18:23,340 --> 04:18:24,600
Oh, that was...

6855
04:18:24,600 --> 04:18:25,260
That would have cooked.

6856
04:18:27,560 --> 04:18:28,580
Oh, nice!

6857
04:18:28,840 --> 04:18:29,320
Nice!

6858
04:18:31,020 --> 04:18:31,540
Nice!

6859
04:18:31,620 --> 04:18:32,340
Holy shit!

6860
04:18:34,340 --> 04:18:35,100
Oh, damage!

6861
04:18:36,080 --> 04:18:37,440
Send him into the moon!

6862
04:18:37,980 --> 04:18:38,420
Make the ground?

6863
04:18:38,600 --> 04:18:39,080
Oh, shit.

6864
04:18:39,400 --> 04:18:40,000
Got him.

6865
04:18:40,100 --> 04:18:40,800
It's okay.

6866
04:18:41,440 --> 04:18:41,960
Nice!

6867
04:18:42,620 --> 04:18:43,780
What the fuck?

6868
04:18:44,060 --> 04:18:45,980
What was that being?

6869
04:18:46,140 --> 04:18:47,500
Dude, that is very...

6870
04:18:49,280 --> 04:18:50,400
Oh, disrespectful!

6871
04:18:51,100 --> 04:18:52,720
Oh, my God!

6872
04:18:53,100 --> 04:18:53,660
Slime!

6873
04:18:53,660 --> 04:18:55,360
That is extremely disrespectful.

6874
04:18:56,520 --> 04:18:57,080
Let's go.

6875
04:18:57,240 --> 04:18:59,200
Who taught you that?

6876
04:19:00,400 --> 04:19:01,720
Let's fucking go.

6877
04:19:02,380 --> 04:19:04,800
Who taught you that and can I do it too?

6878
04:19:04,920 --> 04:19:05,420
You killed the vibes, man!

6879
04:19:05,660 --> 04:19:06,860
You killed the vibes!

6880
04:19:09,160 --> 04:19:10,120
Let's fucking go.

6881
04:19:10,220 --> 04:19:12,160
The chat said, fuck you, slime.

6882
04:19:14,200 --> 04:19:15,380
Shifter in the chat!

6883
04:19:16,920 --> 04:19:18,040
Shifter in the chat!

6884
04:19:19,020 --> 04:19:20,280
In the chat over there.

6885
04:19:20,720 --> 04:19:23,020
On the main broadcast too!

6886
04:19:24,100 --> 04:19:25,220
On the main broadcast too!

6887
04:19:25,220 --> 04:19:26,180
Let's fucking go.

6888
04:19:27,020 --> 04:19:29,440
I need his team's reaction to that.

6889
04:19:31,220 --> 04:19:31,820
I need his team's reaction to that.

6890
04:19:31,820 --> 04:19:32,640
Was that intentional?

6891
04:19:33,540 --> 04:19:35,000
That's very funny.

6892
04:19:35,180 --> 04:19:36,060
100%, yeah.

6893
04:19:36,220 --> 04:19:37,460
That's very funny.

6894
04:19:37,820 --> 04:19:39,660
I thought you fucked up an input.

6895
04:19:39,740 --> 04:19:43,400
Oh, my God.

6896
04:19:43,940 --> 04:19:45,240
Now do that again.

6897
04:19:47,240 --> 04:19:48,160
Get him, Jack.

6898
04:19:48,300 --> 04:19:49,520
They're roasting me on commentary?

6899
04:19:50,080 --> 04:19:50,560
What?

6900
04:19:51,140 --> 04:19:52,380
How dare they?

6901
04:19:52,380 --> 04:19:54,220
They're saying I taught you that.

6902
04:19:54,460 --> 04:19:55,420
Or whatever.

6903
04:19:56,480 --> 04:19:58,440
Yeah, I got it on my repute that someone kicked you.

6904
04:19:58,440 --> 04:19:59,060
I mean, they're right.

6905
04:19:59,400 --> 04:20:01,260
It was all Brawl Pro's fault.

6906
04:20:06,680 --> 04:20:08,960
Can't believe you would do such a thing, Brawl Pro.

6907
04:20:09,060 --> 04:20:09,740
What about the integrity?

6908
04:20:10,880 --> 04:20:11,940
Oh, he kicked it.

6909
04:20:12,020 --> 04:20:12,460
Wow,

6910
04:20:15,970 --> 04:20:16,410
that was loud.

6911
04:20:17,950 --> 04:20:18,850
Oh, my God.

6912
04:20:31,510 --> 04:20:32,030
Nice.

6913
04:20:33,350 --> 04:20:34,070
Clean round.

6914
04:20:34,290 --> 04:20:34,810
Nice!

6915
04:20:35,510 --> 04:20:36,250
Hell yeah.

6916
04:20:36,770 --> 04:20:37,550
So clean.

6917
04:20:40,290 --> 04:20:41,330
Oh, launch.

6918
04:20:41,330 --> 04:20:42,370
Gonna hit the ceiling.

6919
04:20:43,310 --> 04:20:43,830
Oh!

6920
04:20:45,610 --> 04:20:46,130
Nice.

6921
04:20:47,190 --> 04:20:49,550
I can't believe we got this guy on our team again.

6922
04:20:50,770 --> 04:20:51,790
This is crazy.

6923
04:20:52,210 --> 04:20:52,710
See?

6924
04:20:53,350 --> 04:20:53,870
See?

6925
04:20:54,170 --> 04:20:56,150
Run it back.

6926
04:20:58,050 --> 04:20:58,050
See?

6927
04:20:58,050 --> 04:20:59,350
That's how it worked out, dude.

6928
04:21:00,270 --> 04:21:02,830
I think ZayJamp just didn't want to pay for more Evo trips.

6929
04:21:03,830 --> 04:21:05,430
Yeah, well, give him Jack these days.

6930
04:21:11,430 --> 04:21:13,890
I wanna get the cool combo.

6931
04:21:13,970 --> 04:21:14,930
Should I fucking farm for it?

6932
04:21:15,130 --> 04:21:15,530
No!

6933
04:21:18,290 --> 04:21:20,550
Oh, he had to disrespect doing.

6934
04:21:20,930 --> 04:21:22,610
I'll be the devil on your shoulders.

6935
04:21:22,690 --> 04:21:23,990
Yeah, do it.

6936
04:21:24,010 --> 04:21:24,350
Do it.

6937
04:21:24,350 --> 04:21:25,310
We're down by one currently.

6938
04:21:26,190 --> 04:21:27,070
Clip, clip, clip, clip.

6939
04:21:27,390 --> 04:21:28,290
Alright, I'm checking.

6940
04:21:28,290 --> 04:21:29,210
Check it, check it.

6941
04:21:31,670 --> 04:21:32,770
Where is it?

6942
04:21:32,930 --> 04:21:35,410
Oh, my God!

6943
04:21:36,870 --> 04:21:38,050
Oh, my God!

6944
04:21:38,910 --> 04:21:40,230
ZayJ had two levels.

6945
04:21:40,630 --> 04:21:41,070
What?

6946
04:21:41,490 --> 04:21:42,630
Where's another one?

6947
04:21:43,190 --> 04:21:44,750
Is there a third level?

6948
04:21:45,350 --> 04:21:46,970
Dude, that's really crazy.

6949
04:21:48,210 --> 04:21:49,990
It was so fucking worth it.

6950
04:21:50,070 --> 04:21:50,730
It was so worth it.

6951
04:21:50,730 --> 04:21:52,010
The content.

6952
04:21:52,930 --> 04:21:53,970
Holy shit.

6953
04:21:55,210 --> 04:21:56,750
That was unreal.

6954
04:21:57,150 --> 04:21:57,650
Oh, my God.

6955
04:21:58,870 --> 04:22:00,250
I've never seen that.

6956
04:22:01,790 --> 04:22:04,090
Yeah, we played with a little stank on it.

6957
04:22:04,330 --> 04:22:05,250
That was insane.

6958
04:22:05,250 --> 04:22:05,590
That was the fucking thing.

6959
04:22:08,130 --> 04:22:09,230
Oh, launch.

6960
04:22:09,230 --> 04:22:09,970
Hit the ceiling.

6961
04:22:10,410 --> 04:22:10,950
Nice.

6962
04:22:11,230 --> 04:22:11,930
Do it again.

6963
04:22:12,130 --> 04:22:12,610
Run it back.

6964
04:22:15,150 --> 04:22:16,550
This is insane.

6965
04:22:17,250 --> 04:22:20,590
No matter how many times I watch it, the screen is just shaking.

6966
04:22:22,110 --> 04:22:23,610
What the fuck, man?

6967
04:22:23,770 --> 04:22:24,290
That's perfect.

6968
04:22:24,310 --> 04:22:25,630
What do you do against this?

6969
04:22:27,310 --> 04:22:28,210
Atlas hammer.

6970
04:22:29,350 --> 04:22:30,530
Well, that's not Atlas hammer.

6971
04:22:30,790 --> 04:22:33,830
I think this is the most unlucky matchup for this person.

6972
04:22:34,210 --> 04:22:36,830
I think this is the most unlucky matchup for this person.

6973
04:22:36,830 --> 04:22:37,210
Oh, shit.

6974
04:22:37,270 --> 04:22:37,710
Nice gunner.

6975
04:22:37,770 --> 04:22:38,990
Oh, my God.

6976
04:22:39,130 --> 04:22:40,410
They got the hit in.

6977
04:22:40,910 --> 04:22:41,670
Oh, my God.

6978
04:22:42,170 --> 04:22:42,910
That's dirty.

6979
04:22:45,410 --> 04:22:45,890
Nice.

6980
04:22:45,890 --> 04:22:47,330
The perfect run is over.

6981
04:22:48,190 --> 04:22:48,670
Oh.

6982
04:22:51,190 --> 04:22:51,630
Nice.

6983
04:22:53,610 --> 04:22:54,050
Oh.

6984
04:22:54,830 --> 04:22:55,710
Someone's nervous.

6985
04:22:59,170 --> 04:23:00,070
He got hit.

6986
04:23:00,190 --> 04:23:00,950
He doesn't know what to do.

6987
04:23:01,290 --> 04:23:01,450
Oh, my God.

6988
04:23:01,650 --> 04:23:02,930
You're so annoying.

6989
04:23:03,670 --> 04:23:04,270
You're annoying, dude.

6990
04:23:04,490 --> 04:23:05,190
You're annoying.

6991
04:23:06,370 --> 04:23:07,790
That is so annoying.

6992
04:23:08,230 --> 04:23:09,450
For a read.

6993
04:23:12,090 --> 04:23:13,190
She's still alive, though.

6994
04:23:14,170 --> 04:23:14,950
No way.

6995
04:23:14,990 --> 04:23:16,630
We're spring kicking into chat.

6996
04:23:16,630 --> 04:23:17,570
That's not gonna do it.

6997
04:23:17,570 --> 04:23:18,190
Round three.

6998
04:23:18,350 --> 04:23:18,970
The read.

6999
04:23:20,190 --> 04:23:20,890
Blast off.

7000
04:23:22,110 --> 04:23:24,430
She's in her PC reading the inputs.

7001
04:23:25,250 --> 04:23:26,030
God, dude.

7002
04:23:26,150 --> 04:23:28,690
That was good.

7003
04:23:36,810 --> 04:23:37,330
Oh.

7004
04:23:37,850 --> 04:23:38,990
Yo, round two.

7005
04:23:39,210 --> 04:23:39,710
Round two.

7006
04:23:39,710 --> 04:23:40,150
Do it again.

7007
04:23:40,170 --> 04:23:41,010
Do the combo.

7008
04:23:41,410 --> 04:23:41,930
Yes.

7009
04:23:42,030 --> 04:23:42,550
No way.

7010
04:23:42,770 --> 04:23:43,870
Oh, my God.

7011
04:23:46,030 --> 04:23:46,570
It's okay.

7012
04:23:46,690 --> 04:23:48,030
We already got one of it for the video.

7013
04:23:48,610 --> 04:23:49,130
Dude.

7014
04:23:50,750 --> 04:23:51,270
Nice.

7015
04:23:51,270 --> 04:23:52,070
Nice job.

7016
04:23:52,590 --> 04:23:53,430
Did he quit on me, bro?

7017
04:23:53,550 --> 04:23:53,990
What the fuck?

7018
04:23:54,430 --> 04:23:54,450
Oh, fuck.

7019
04:23:56,110 --> 04:23:56,510
Gifter.

7020
04:23:58,130 --> 04:23:58,770
You were.

7021
04:24:01,210 --> 04:24:02,470
It's tournament, man.

7022
04:24:02,830 --> 04:24:03,490
He left.

7023
04:24:04,330 --> 04:24:05,130
Oh, no.

7024
04:24:06,070 --> 04:24:06,470
Why?

7025
04:24:06,650 --> 04:24:07,510
Because I made a read?

7026
04:24:09,250 --> 04:24:10,710
I told you you were playing annoying.

7027
04:24:10,870 --> 04:24:12,570
I said you were playing mad annoying.

7028
04:24:14,010 --> 04:24:15,650
You are not fun to play with.

7029
04:24:15,990 --> 04:24:16,650
That's fine.

7030
04:24:17,050 --> 04:24:17,590
That's the goal.

7031
04:24:17,590 --> 04:24:17,850
Oh, my God.

7032
04:24:17,930 --> 04:24:19,270
Did he actually leave?

7033
04:24:19,410 --> 04:24:19,810
That's insane.

7034
04:24:22,930 --> 04:24:23,810
He left.

7035
04:24:23,950 --> 04:24:24,250
He left.

7036
04:24:25,210 --> 04:24:26,290
That's fucking crazy.

7037
04:24:26,770 --> 04:24:27,710
Oh, my God.

7038
04:24:29,010 --> 04:24:31,770
You hit me with that, I'm leaving the lobby and I'm uninstalling.

7039
04:24:31,990 --> 04:24:32,970
I'll ask for a steam refund.

7040
04:24:33,230 --> 04:24:34,590
I'm not playing this shit anymore.

7041
04:24:35,210 --> 04:24:37,110
We need a last minute replacement.

7042
04:24:38,910 --> 04:24:39,870
Oh, my God.

7043
04:24:39,870 --> 04:24:40,590
I did it, guys.

7044
04:24:43,430 --> 04:24:46,870
He actually plugged in the round robin.

7045
04:24:48,390 --> 04:24:49,490
He said, Matt, man.

7046
04:24:49,870 --> 04:24:50,310
Yeah.

7047
04:24:50,310 --> 04:24:51,010
What's up, bro?

7048
04:24:51,590 --> 04:24:52,150
GG's, man.

7049
04:24:52,350 --> 04:24:53,290
Hope to see you at EVO, dude.

7050
04:24:55,550 --> 04:24:56,490
You're posting?

7051
04:24:57,250 --> 04:24:57,730
How?

7052
04:24:57,910 --> 04:24:59,570
Because I optimized?

7053
04:24:59,990 --> 04:25:00,270
What?

7054
04:25:03,010 --> 04:25:04,570
He's being so toxic.

7055
04:25:07,410 --> 04:25:07,950
Dumb fuck.

7056
04:25:07,950 --> 04:25:09,430
I hope to see you at EVO, bro.

7057
04:25:09,690 --> 04:25:12,330
I'm on his side.

7058
04:25:12,850 --> 04:25:14,710
I'll shake your hand at EVO, man.

7059
04:25:14,850 --> 04:25:15,690
Hope to see you there.

7060
04:25:20,030 --> 04:25:20,990
That's Chandelier.

7061
04:25:22,370 --> 04:25:24,730
How can I focus after what's happened?

7062
04:25:25,150 --> 04:25:29,730
I feel like we should get extra points for making somebody plug.

7063
04:25:30,790 --> 04:25:32,830
I mean, like, for real, though.

7064
04:25:35,470 --> 04:25:36,370
Oh, shit.

7065
04:25:36,850 --> 04:25:38,670
Rob, bro, focus up.

7066
04:25:40,290 --> 04:25:40,850
How?

7067
04:25:40,950 --> 04:25:42,650
Do you see what's going on?

7068
04:25:42,830 --> 04:25:43,630
But how?

7069
04:25:45,310 --> 04:25:47,930
If I can play while distracted, so can you.

7070
04:25:49,230 --> 04:25:49,790
Oh.

7071
04:25:49,830 --> 04:25:50,370
Oh.

7072
04:25:50,410 --> 04:25:50,970
Oh, my God.

7073
04:25:50,990 --> 04:25:51,670
Maybe not.

7074
04:26:00,460 --> 04:26:00,900
Oh.

7075
04:26:01,100 --> 04:26:01,200
Oh.

7076
04:26:01,200 --> 04:26:01,220
He did.

7077
04:26:03,860 --> 04:26:05,100
Come on, you got this.

7078
04:26:05,360 --> 04:26:07,040
I don't know what his habits are.

7079
04:26:07,120 --> 04:26:08,160
I guess we'll figure them out here.

7080
04:26:08,680 --> 04:26:09,840
We're doing it live.

7081
04:26:10,660 --> 04:26:11,900
Doing it live.

7082
04:26:12,700 --> 04:26:13,680
All in all.

7083
04:26:22,360 --> 04:26:22,800
Hmm.

7084
04:26:25,540 --> 04:26:25,980
What?

7085
04:26:28,440 --> 04:26:29,440
I'm telling y'all.

7086
04:26:29,500 --> 04:26:30,840
It's just Rage Arts, dude.

7087
04:26:31,620 --> 04:26:32,360
I'm just saying, man.

7088
04:26:33,320 --> 04:26:36,340
It's funny that the coaches are doing it way more than anyone else.

7089
04:26:36,420 --> 04:26:37,420
Just rip it, bro.

7090
04:26:38,200 --> 04:26:39,000
You're right, bro.

7091
04:26:39,260 --> 04:26:40,540
Fucking rip it.

7092
04:26:41,620 --> 04:26:42,860
It's all about the wins.

7093
04:26:45,360 --> 04:26:47,680
Consider it like armor, but it also armor blows.

7094
04:26:53,880 --> 04:26:54,680
Oh, nice.

7095
04:26:56,060 --> 04:26:57,080
Oh, my God.

7096
04:26:57,400 --> 04:26:58,700
Oh, my God.

7097
04:26:59,280 --> 04:27:00,300
Big tummy ache.

7098
04:27:02,260 --> 04:27:02,740
Nice.

7099
04:27:02,740 --> 04:27:03,100
Ouch.

7100
04:27:05,480 --> 04:27:06,460
Oh, my God.

7101
04:27:06,540 --> 04:27:07,460
Oh, my God.

7102
04:27:09,240 --> 04:27:09,520
Chill.

7103
04:27:09,980 --> 04:27:10,540
Relax.

7104
04:27:12,480 --> 04:27:14,080
Give him another turn.

7105
04:27:14,180 --> 04:27:14,840
Put him down, bro.

7106
04:27:15,080 --> 04:27:15,940
It's his turn.

7107
04:27:18,040 --> 04:27:18,640
Samuel L.

7108
04:27:22,220 --> 04:27:23,320
Jackson comes in.

7109
04:27:25,200 --> 04:27:27,040
Put that young woman down.

7110
04:27:28,760 --> 04:27:29,320
Oh.

7111
04:27:30,060 --> 04:27:31,360
Oh, my God.

7112
04:27:31,440 --> 04:27:32,860
Dude, are you serious?

7113
04:27:33,660 --> 04:27:35,460
Oh, my God.

7114
04:27:37,420 --> 04:27:37,700
Nice.

7115
04:27:39,600 --> 04:27:40,820
Oh, my God.

7116
04:27:40,860 --> 04:27:41,840
He's locking it in.

7117
04:27:42,020 --> 04:27:42,820
You go, coach.

7118
04:27:43,240 --> 04:27:44,100
Second coach.

7119
04:27:45,980 --> 04:27:47,120
The side coach.

7120
04:27:47,300 --> 04:27:48,020
The side coach.

7121
04:27:49,800 --> 04:27:50,840
Go, coach.

7122
04:27:50,960 --> 04:27:51,540
Go, coach.

7123
04:27:52,080 --> 04:27:53,780
Coach B.

7124
04:27:54,380 --> 04:27:55,660
It's like a summer camp.

7125
04:27:56,200 --> 04:27:57,100
Yeah, yeah.

7126
04:27:59,260 --> 04:28:00,100
Substitute teacher.

7127
04:28:02,880 --> 04:28:03,440
Nice.

7128
04:28:04,600 --> 04:28:05,380
Oh, good break.

7129
04:28:06,800 --> 04:28:08,240
Oh, this guy's paying attention to everything.

7130
04:28:08,460 --> 04:28:08,480
Oh.

7131
04:28:10,400 --> 04:28:10,840
Wait.

7132
04:28:11,940 --> 04:28:12,480
What the fuck?

7133
04:28:12,620 --> 04:28:13,060
Surely.

7134
04:28:14,980 --> 04:28:16,020
This little kid is showing it.

7135
04:28:16,460 --> 04:28:16,900
Surely.

7136
04:28:18,440 --> 04:28:19,580
Okay, I was gonna say.

7137
04:28:23,080 --> 04:28:24,240
Break the window.

7138
04:28:25,280 --> 04:28:26,320
Break the window.

7139
04:28:27,160 --> 04:28:27,600
Nice.

7140
04:28:27,940 --> 04:28:28,320
Oh.

7141
04:28:29,080 --> 04:28:29,520
Oh.

7142
04:28:29,520 --> 04:28:30,080
Oh.

7143
04:28:30,380 --> 04:28:33,100
Oh, no.

7144
04:28:33,420 --> 04:28:34,580
Does he got a mega combo?

7145
04:28:35,180 --> 04:28:35,660
Well.

7146
04:28:37,260 --> 04:28:38,240
Oh, my God.

7147
04:28:38,260 --> 04:28:39,260
He broke two windows.

7148
04:28:39,380 --> 04:28:42,700
Processing combo.

7149
04:28:44,200 --> 04:28:44,680
Nice.

7150
04:28:44,740 --> 04:28:45,060
Nice.

7151
04:28:45,480 --> 04:28:48,180
What a fucked up stage.

7152
04:28:48,760 --> 04:28:49,820
Oh, my God.

7153
04:28:51,000 --> 04:28:52,540
They got nukes in the sun room.

7154
04:28:55,520 --> 04:28:57,220
Oh, this is where Jackie's built.

7155
04:28:57,520 --> 04:28:58,000
Yeah.

7156
04:28:58,000 --> 04:28:59,600
When would they expect it?

7157
04:29:00,660 --> 04:29:01,880
Dude, everything's exploding.

7158
04:29:02,140 --> 04:29:03,240
Where is the safety?

7159
04:29:05,340 --> 04:29:06,720
There's no OSHA here.

7160
04:29:06,980 --> 04:29:07,020
This thing's crazy.

7161
04:29:09,340 --> 04:29:11,320
I think King has four clips there, though.

7162
04:29:12,960 --> 04:29:13,680
Oh, nice.

7163
04:29:16,560 --> 04:29:17,780
Oh, my God.

7164
04:29:21,370 --> 04:29:22,110
Oh, who?

7165
04:29:23,070 --> 04:29:23,750
Oh, no.

7166
04:29:27,290 --> 04:29:28,510
What in the fuck?

7167
04:29:29,570 --> 04:29:30,310
Oh.

7168
04:29:30,310 --> 04:29:30,690
Oh,

7169
04:29:42,230 --> 04:29:43,010
the brakes.

7170
04:29:43,070 --> 04:29:43,770
How the fuck did you break that?

7171
04:29:43,770 --> 04:29:44,450
Yeah.

7172
04:29:44,530 --> 04:29:46,070
You just pushed her off.

7173
04:29:49,500 --> 04:29:50,240
Nice.

7174
04:29:50,540 --> 04:29:51,180
Oh.

7175
04:29:56,200 --> 04:29:57,060
That's right.

7176
04:29:57,120 --> 04:29:58,580
Keep being close for the YouTube video.

7177
04:29:58,960 --> 04:29:59,540
Dude.

7178
04:29:59,540 --> 04:30:00,160
Nice.

7179
04:30:00,480 --> 04:30:01,880
So many moves.

7180
04:30:02,360 --> 04:30:03,340
Round four.

7181
04:30:04,220 --> 04:30:04,960
Fight.

7182
04:30:14,840 --> 04:30:16,000
Please stop.

7183
04:30:18,260 --> 04:30:18,630
Oh.

7184
04:30:19,000 --> 04:30:19,260
Oh.

7185
04:30:20,400 --> 04:30:21,040
Perfect.

7186
04:30:21,260 --> 04:30:21,960
I know.

7187
04:30:22,060 --> 04:30:22,580
Muhammad Ali.

7188
04:30:23,680 --> 04:30:25,200
The dodges, too.

7189
04:30:25,520 --> 04:30:25,840
Oh.

7190
04:30:29,960 --> 04:30:30,600
Okay.

7191
04:30:30,940 --> 04:30:31,580
Nice.

7192
04:30:35,080 --> 04:30:36,040
Oh, my God.

7193
04:30:36,060 --> 04:30:36,460
The damage.

7194
04:30:40,420 --> 04:30:41,060
Okay.

7195
04:30:41,580 --> 04:30:42,100
Dead?

7196
04:30:42,140 --> 04:30:43,020
Oh, is she dead?

7197
04:30:43,160 --> 04:30:43,300
Yeah.

7198
04:30:43,420 --> 04:30:43,860
Yeah.

7199
04:30:44,500 --> 04:30:45,220
He's strong.

7200
04:30:48,420 --> 04:30:49,060
Fight.

7201
04:30:51,200 --> 04:30:51,800
What?

7202
04:30:51,800 --> 04:30:52,620
Platform again.

7203
04:30:52,760 --> 04:30:53,640
He did a four there.

7204
04:31:01,830 --> 04:31:02,550
Damn it.

7205
04:31:02,670 --> 04:31:03,190
Oh.

7206
04:31:06,230 --> 04:31:07,930
How the fuck did that wall blast?

7207
04:31:08,270 --> 04:31:08,910
That's crazy.

7208
04:31:11,720 --> 04:31:12,320
Imagine.

7209
04:31:12,860 --> 04:31:13,460
Imagine.

7210
04:31:13,740 --> 04:31:14,100
Oh.

7211
04:31:14,580 --> 04:31:15,360
Oh, no.

7212
04:31:15,420 --> 04:31:15,960
Oh, good.

7213
04:31:16,080 --> 04:31:16,440
No.

7214
04:31:16,660 --> 04:31:17,680
It's so close.

7215
04:31:18,520 --> 04:31:22,280
His enlarged steroid heart finally exploded.

7216
04:31:22,620 --> 04:31:23,220
.

7217
04:31:23,220 --> 04:31:23,640
.

7218
04:31:23,640 --> 04:31:24,200
.

7219
04:31:28,180 --> 04:31:28,900
All right.

7220
04:31:29,120 --> 04:31:32,180
Dude, if we sweep this one, that'd be such a good cap off to the day.

7221
04:31:32,300 --> 04:31:34,560
So, no pressure, Unc, but all the pressure.

7222
04:31:34,660 --> 04:31:35,660
Unfortunately, I lost.

7223
04:31:35,700 --> 04:31:36,640
You can't sweep it.

7224
04:31:37,160 --> 04:31:37,900
Wait, you did?

7225
04:31:38,160 --> 04:31:39,240
I was thinking that, too.

7226
04:31:39,340 --> 04:31:39,640
Yeah.

7227
04:31:40,160 --> 04:31:41,360
Everyone's just going to remember the combo.

7228
04:31:41,380 --> 04:31:42,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7229
04:31:42,240 --> 04:31:43,280
Everybody's just going to remember that.

7230
04:31:43,280 --> 04:31:45,240
No, look, we can lie.

7231
04:31:45,560 --> 04:31:45,880
You got your moment.

7232
04:31:46,040 --> 04:31:46,960
Yeah, I really did.

7233
04:31:48,640 --> 04:31:52,500
If we think we sweeped it, the fans will think we sweeped it.

7234
04:31:54,120 --> 04:31:55,960
We just changed the narrative.

7235
04:31:56,080 --> 04:31:56,980
Yeah, change the narrative.

7236
04:31:57,600 --> 04:31:59,840
Only the winners write in history, and we're winning.

7237
04:32:00,820 --> 04:32:01,620
Oh, shh.

7238
04:32:03,660 --> 04:32:04,320
Oh, god.

7239
04:32:10,380 --> 04:32:11,000
That's crazy.

7240
04:32:11,060 --> 04:32:12,140
How did she miss that?

7241
04:32:13,440 --> 04:32:14,200
All right, through.

7242
04:32:16,560 --> 04:32:17,100
Ernesto?

7243
04:32:17,440 --> 04:32:17,980
Oh!

7244
04:32:21,240 --> 04:32:22,100
You threw?

7245
04:32:22,240 --> 04:32:23,120
What do you mean?

7246
04:32:23,660 --> 04:32:26,580
How did you know that was...

7247
04:32:26,580 --> 04:32:27,460
Is it 12 frame?

7248
04:32:27,580 --> 04:32:28,120
You're a freak.

7249
04:32:29,380 --> 04:32:29,920
The...

7250
04:32:31,020 --> 04:32:34,000
Azucena's backswing, where she, like, evades, is launch punishable.

7251
04:32:34,360 --> 04:32:35,120
Oh, wow.

7252
04:32:35,460 --> 04:32:36,900
Most backswings in the game.

7253
04:32:37,080 --> 04:32:37,740
Oh, god!

7254
04:32:38,620 --> 04:32:40,120
Read her fucking mind!

7255
04:32:40,560 --> 04:32:41,280
He was ready.

7256
04:32:42,940 --> 04:32:43,920
Oh, my god!

7257
04:32:44,200 --> 04:32:44,500
Oh!

7258
04:32:46,900 --> 04:32:47,400
Oh!

7259
04:32:47,800 --> 04:32:48,420
Let's go!

7260
04:32:48,860 --> 04:32:50,180
Good stage, bro!

7261
04:32:51,500 --> 04:32:52,680
Pizza Hut manager.

7262
04:32:53,280 --> 04:32:54,200
Oh, my god.

7263
04:32:55,040 --> 04:32:56,780
This is what it's like to block.

7264
04:32:57,900 --> 04:32:58,400
Nice.

7265
04:32:59,620 --> 04:33:01,160
It is a nair, yeah.

7266
04:33:03,540 --> 04:33:04,040
Nice.

7267
04:33:14,330 --> 04:33:15,130
Just pressure.

7268
04:33:16,630 --> 04:33:17,970
Sometimes you're just wrong.

7269
04:33:18,150 --> 04:33:18,630
Yeah.

7270
04:33:19,890 --> 04:33:21,270
How was that not counter-hit?

7271
04:33:24,090 --> 04:33:24,650
I don't know.

7272
04:33:24,650 --> 04:33:25,490
She's on the Wi-Fi.

7273
04:33:27,930 --> 04:33:28,690
What the...

7274
04:33:28,690 --> 04:33:29,430
Oh, he's nice.

7275
04:33:29,710 --> 04:33:30,910
That was a good block, though.

7276
04:33:32,350 --> 04:33:32,790
Oh!

7277
04:33:34,690 --> 04:33:35,510
Good stuff!

7278
04:33:35,530 --> 04:33:36,370
He's ducking hard.

7279
04:33:37,590 --> 04:33:38,230
He knows.

7280
04:33:44,540 --> 04:33:45,580
Oh, that's close.

7281
04:33:46,060 --> 04:33:47,000
Oh, here we go, bro.

7282
04:33:47,720 --> 04:33:48,480
Let's go, baby.

7283
04:33:49,180 --> 04:33:50,020
Wrap it up.

7284
04:33:53,160 --> 04:33:53,600
Nice!

7285
04:33:54,280 --> 04:33:54,720
Nice.

7286
04:33:54,720 --> 04:33:55,040
Good shit.

7287
04:34:00,420 --> 04:34:01,200
Damn it.

7288
04:34:01,280 --> 04:34:02,180
Damn it.

7289
04:34:02,180 --> 04:34:02,200
Aw.

7290
04:34:04,400 --> 04:34:05,000
Aw.

7291
04:34:05,560 --> 04:34:06,440
That's unfortunate.

7292
04:34:12,620 --> 04:34:13,660
Oh, god!

7293
04:34:14,180 --> 04:34:15,180
So close!

7294
04:34:15,340 --> 04:34:15,780
Into the window!

7295
04:34:17,940 --> 04:34:18,540
Nice.

7296
04:34:18,840 --> 04:34:19,100
Nice.

7297
04:34:19,440 --> 04:34:19,720
GG.

7298
04:34:19,900 --> 04:34:20,020
GG.

7299
04:34:20,040 --> 04:34:20,760
Pretty good.

7300
04:34:20,800 --> 04:34:21,800
Good player, bro.

7301
04:34:21,880 --> 04:34:22,400
Good player.

7302
04:34:23,880 --> 04:34:25,500
That was a toughie.

7303
04:34:28,240 --> 04:34:29,620
Still 3-2, though.

7304
04:34:29,620 --> 04:34:30,300
Yeah, 3-2.

7305
04:34:30,360 --> 04:34:30,860
We won it.

7306
04:34:31,060 --> 04:34:31,720
We won it.

7307
04:34:31,840 --> 04:34:34,000
We were positive on most of our matches, if not all.

7308
04:34:34,620 --> 04:34:35,900
I'm looking at the scoreboard.

7309
04:34:35,980 --> 04:34:37,320
I don't know if it's updated, but...

7310
04:34:37,320 --> 04:34:39,100
Well, I think they're still playing.

7311
04:34:39,200 --> 04:34:40,700
MYK is first at 14.

7312
04:34:41,360 --> 04:34:43,060
We didn't get updated yet, but...

7313
04:34:43,060 --> 04:34:44,020
We're at 12.

7314
04:34:44,260 --> 04:34:45,900
So if we went 3-2, I think we're...

7315
04:34:46,620 --> 04:34:47,180
We're 15.

7316
04:34:48,480 --> 04:34:49,360
Wait, so we first?

7317
04:34:49,740 --> 04:34:50,620
So we're first unless Hidetone...

7318
04:34:50,620 --> 04:34:52,500
Yeah, we're first unless Hidetone...

7319
04:34:53,420 --> 04:34:53,820
sweeps.

7320
04:34:54,700 --> 04:34:56,280
Wait, have they finished their game yet?

7321
04:34:56,280 --> 04:34:57,480
Or if they 4-1.

7322
04:34:59,600 --> 04:35:01,720
Because Hidetone is 11.

7323
04:35:03,080 --> 04:35:05,420
KFM is 7, so I don't think they can hit us no matter what.

7324
04:35:05,700 --> 04:35:06,040
But...

7325
04:35:07,580 --> 04:35:09,120
Yeah, so we're at 15.

7326
04:35:09,420 --> 04:35:11,580
If Hidetone goes 4-1, we tie.

7327
04:35:11,920 --> 04:35:12,720
Oh, okay.

7328
04:35:13,020 --> 04:35:13,840
So we...

7329
04:35:13,840 --> 04:35:14,980
Hey, that's really good!

7330
04:35:15,640 --> 04:35:16,320
We might have won.

7331
04:35:16,420 --> 04:35:18,880
Yeah, honestly, that's sick.

7332
04:35:18,900 --> 04:35:20,020
Especially for like...

7333
04:35:20,020 --> 04:35:21,760
We didn't practice as much.

7334
04:35:22,060 --> 04:35:22,540
Yeah.

7335
04:35:23,080 --> 04:35:23,380
Seriously.

7336
04:35:26,280 --> 04:35:26,460
We're not even in the tournament, bro.

7337
04:35:27,420 --> 04:35:29,760
Well, didn't you start your practice like yesterday, Koni?

7338
04:35:30,280 --> 04:35:30,680
Yes.

7339
04:35:30,980 --> 04:35:33,900
I played a lot the first time.

7340
04:35:34,660 --> 04:35:36,280
This time, I'm like, it's day one.

7341
04:35:36,300 --> 04:35:36,980
It's just learning.

7342
04:35:37,420 --> 04:35:39,800
I'm not, you know... I didn't take it as seriously.

7343
04:35:41,840 --> 04:35:42,800
Good shit, guys.

7344
04:35:43,040 --> 04:35:43,920
Alright, let's call it a day.

7345
04:35:45,420 --> 04:35:47,940
Does anyone know what Hidetone did?

7346
04:35:48,980 --> 04:35:49,640
I don't know.

7347
04:35:49,780 --> 04:35:50,460
Is he on stream?

7348
04:35:50,800 --> 04:35:51,460
Yeah, chat.

7349
04:35:51,880 --> 04:35:52,440
Stream site.

7350
04:35:52,660 --> 04:35:53,860
How well did Hidetone did?

7351
04:35:59,660 --> 04:36:00,800
Where's my stream snipers?

7352
04:36:00,920 --> 04:36:01,660
3-2?

7353
04:36:02,540 --> 04:36:04,180
They were saying 3-2 in my chat.

7354
04:36:04,540 --> 04:36:05,960
If it's 3-2, then we're first.

7355
04:36:06,120 --> 04:36:07,020
Yeah, we're first.

7356
04:36:07,140 --> 04:36:07,740
Because we're 15.

7357
04:36:08,300 --> 04:36:09,560
Was that the last one?

7358
04:36:09,840 --> 04:36:10,500
Yeah, that's it.

7359
04:36:10,680 --> 04:36:11,720
We were on stream for the last one.

7360
04:36:11,980 --> 04:36:12,340
Yeah.

7361
04:36:12,520 --> 04:36:13,360
Oh, cool.

7362
04:36:14,220 --> 04:36:15,000
Yeah, we won.

7363
04:36:15,080 --> 04:36:15,700
We won the day.

7364
04:36:15,800 --> 04:36:16,240
Good shit, fellas!

7365
04:36:16,580 --> 04:36:16,800
Yeah!

7366
04:36:17,040 --> 04:36:17,920
We did it!

7367
04:36:18,340 --> 04:36:18,840
We won the day?

7368
04:36:19,280 --> 04:36:19,720
Yeah!

7369
04:36:22,600 --> 04:36:27,320
And if people try to download me, I'm only at 1% of my level right now.

7370
04:36:28,660 --> 04:36:29,640
And if people try to download me, I'm only at 1% of my level right now.

7371
04:36:29,640 --> 04:36:30,180
I'm using the scoreboard.

7372
04:36:30,360 --> 04:36:31,160
I don't know...

7373
04:36:31,160 --> 04:36:33,900
It hasn't been updated for KFM or Tone.

7374
04:36:34,020 --> 04:36:35,860
But it doesn't matter.

7375
04:36:35,960 --> 04:36:37,540
Because they can't reach us.

7376
04:36:39,680 --> 04:36:42,160
Hidetone, if he went 3-2, is 14 also.

7377
04:36:42,480 --> 04:36:42,920
Yeah.

7378
04:36:43,040 --> 04:36:43,940
And we're 15.

7379
04:36:45,420 --> 04:36:47,480
They're probably gonna look at match counts after that.

7380
04:36:49,820 --> 04:36:50,260
Woo!

7381
04:36:50,260 --> 04:36:51,420
Good shit, fellas!

7382
04:36:51,600 --> 04:36:52,180
Yeah, guys!

7383
04:36:52,280 --> 04:36:52,900
We did it!

7384
04:36:53,380 --> 04:36:53,820
Okay!

7385
04:36:56,420 --> 04:36:58,640
Donkey, very proud of you for the 2 Ws.

7386
04:36:58,680 --> 04:36:59,220
Let's go!

7387
04:36:59,640 --> 04:37:00,420
I practiced good shit.

7388
04:37:00,620 --> 04:37:02,960
I beat a red, guys!

7389
04:37:05,540 --> 04:37:06,300
Hold on.

7390
04:37:06,300 --> 04:37:06,740
I have a...

7391
04:37:06,740 --> 04:37:08,400
I have a shifter clip.

7392
04:37:08,620 --> 04:37:08,880
Wait.

7393
04:37:09,320 --> 04:37:09,880
Oh!

7394
04:37:10,000 --> 04:37:13,280
George Bush, PNG.

7395
04:37:18,280 --> 04:37:19,980
SirJune has hit a second wall.

7396
04:37:24,840 --> 04:37:25,960
Hold on.

7397
04:37:25,960 --> 04:37:26,560
Oh, god, dude.

7398
04:37:27,160 --> 04:37:28,200
Here you go, chat.

7399
04:37:39,660 --> 04:37:40,720
That's fucking awesome.

7400
04:37:40,940 --> 04:37:41,800
That's fucking awesome.

7401
04:37:43,660 --> 04:37:46,540
Dude, there's still 15 more seconds in the clip.

7402
04:37:46,780 --> 04:37:46,820
Dude, there's still 15 more seconds in the clip.

7403
04:37:47,240 --> 04:37:48,380
Oh, my god!

7404
04:37:54,060 --> 04:37:55,760
Bro, he's coping so hard!

7405
04:38:02,370 --> 04:38:02,890
Nice.

7406
04:38:02,970 --> 04:38:03,690
That was good, though.

7407
04:38:03,710 --> 04:38:04,870
We got a ragequit clip and everything.

7408
04:38:05,210 --> 04:38:05,970
That was pretty good.

7409
04:38:06,270 --> 04:38:07,790
I feel him, man.

7410
04:38:07,850 --> 04:38:08,610
I'm on his side.

7411
04:38:08,710 --> 04:38:10,430
Jack looks annoying as shit.

7412
04:38:10,810 --> 04:38:11,410
Jack looks annoying as shit.

7413
04:38:11,450 --> 04:38:13,310
That looks obnoxious.

7414
04:38:15,310 --> 04:38:16,870
That one combo was ridiculous.

7415
04:38:17,050 --> 04:38:18,010
I don't even...

7416
04:38:19,070 --> 04:38:21,150
Oh, I can't... He was coping so hard.

7417
04:38:21,170 --> 04:38:21,710
Wait, did CJM end?

7418
04:38:22,930 --> 04:38:23,710
Yeah, he did.

7419
04:38:23,970 --> 04:38:25,290
Oh, he just ended the stream.

7420
04:38:25,510 --> 04:38:25,850
That's it.

7421
04:38:25,950 --> 04:38:26,830
I mean, shit, we're done.

7422
04:38:26,930 --> 04:38:27,430
We did.

7423
04:38:27,470 --> 04:38:28,570
No, fucking relax.

7424
04:38:28,690 --> 04:38:29,390
Take a break.

7425
04:38:29,490 --> 04:38:30,250
That was kind of fast.

7426
04:38:30,370 --> 04:38:30,670
Okay.

7427
04:38:31,090 --> 04:38:31,490
Recuperate.

7428
04:38:31,930 --> 04:38:33,150
Alright, fellas, we won!

7429
04:38:33,210 --> 04:38:34,070
Good shit, everybody!

7430
04:38:34,470 --> 04:38:34,530
We did it!

7431
04:38:34,590 --> 04:38:35,310
First day!

7432
04:38:35,650 --> 04:38:36,050
We won again.

7433
04:38:36,510 --> 04:38:37,270
RawProTeam on top.

7434
04:38:37,270 --> 04:38:38,710
We're running back in round two!

7435
04:38:40,110 --> 04:38:40,990
Yeah, so...

7436
04:38:41,950 --> 04:38:48,530
I'm gonna drive home and then I can review some of your guys' stuff and we can talk about everything, like, tomorrow or later tonight.

7437
04:38:48,770 --> 04:38:50,970
So we're ready for the day after.

7438
04:38:51,570 --> 04:38:52,010
Yeah.

7439
04:38:52,130 --> 04:38:52,490
Yeah!

7440
04:38:53,030 --> 04:38:54,610
I'm gonna hop in with you and get some...

7441
04:38:55,250 --> 04:38:55,990
I need some help.

7442
04:38:56,530 --> 04:38:59,670
Yeah, and the thing is, it's very easy to identify.

7443
04:38:59,670 --> 04:39:03,290
It's super easy to identify the shortcomings, you know what I mean?

7444
04:39:03,290 --> 04:39:07,650
I think we all have extremely easy shit to, like, I don't know.

7445
04:39:07,710 --> 04:39:10,130
I trust you guys to adapt harder, you know what I mean?

7446
04:39:10,210 --> 04:39:10,990
Like, I'm not...

7447
04:39:10,990 --> 04:39:12,050
I'm confident.

7448
04:39:12,230 --> 04:39:13,170
You guys are sick.

7449
04:39:13,350 --> 04:39:15,130
I mean, Doki only needs to learn mids, does he?

7450
04:39:15,170 --> 04:39:18,970
Yeah, I just need to learn other combos and... I never expected!

7451
04:39:18,970 --> 04:39:20,750
And to hit the leg drop after the kick, you know?

7452
04:39:20,810 --> 04:39:21,090
Yeah.

7453
04:39:22,990 --> 04:39:25,090
Very simple fine-tuning for our machine.

7454
04:39:26,130 --> 04:39:27,110
That's all I need.

7455
04:39:27,370 --> 04:39:27,370
Good shit, everybody.

7456
04:39:27,390 --> 04:39:28,150
I'm so proud.

7457
04:39:28,290 --> 04:39:29,430
It's so good to be back, bro.

7458
04:39:29,490 --> 04:39:33,010
Now I'm gonna unpack my new PC tomorrow so I won't lag.

7459
04:39:33,950 --> 04:39:34,350
Easy.

7460
04:39:34,550 --> 04:39:35,090
Oh, true.

7461
04:39:35,590 --> 04:39:36,390
We hit everything.

7462
04:39:36,710 --> 04:39:36,750
Yeah.

7463
04:39:38,250 --> 04:39:39,010
Oh my god.

7464
04:39:39,090 --> 04:39:39,910
We're gonna make it.

7465
04:39:39,910 --> 04:39:40,790
We're gonna make it to EVO.

7466
04:39:41,730 --> 04:39:43,670
We're going to... well, you're gonna make it easy.

7467
04:39:43,750 --> 04:39:45,150
Yeah, I'm gonna make it to EVO.

7468
04:39:45,390 --> 04:39:46,930
You can come see us, you know what I'm saying?

7469
04:39:48,550 --> 04:39:51,870
Alright, I'm down to practice maybe late tonight but definitely tomorrow.

7470
04:39:52,030 --> 04:39:52,270
Sound good?

7471
04:39:53,150 --> 04:39:53,730
Yeah, yeah.

7472
04:39:53,790 --> 04:39:56,750
Tonight I'll be with this scuffed mic but yeah, I'm down.

7473
04:39:57,150 --> 04:39:58,210
Alright, brother.

7474
04:39:58,370 --> 04:39:59,050
Take care, everybody.

7475
04:39:59,250 --> 04:39:59,870
I'll see you guys soon.

7476
04:40:00,470 --> 04:40:00,970
GG's, guys!

7477
04:40:01,130 --> 04:40:01,490
GG!

7478
04:40:01,990 --> 04:40:02,850
Road to EVO.

7479
04:40:04,110 --> 04:40:04,730
Bye-bye!

7480
04:40:08,700 --> 04:40:09,800
Oh my god.

7481
04:40:09,840 --> 04:40:12,220
I couldn't find the fucking hang up button just then.

7482
04:40:14,360 --> 04:40:15,720
Oh my god!

7483
04:40:15,960 --> 04:40:16,560
Guys!

7484
04:40:17,520 --> 04:40:18,840
We did so well!

7485
04:40:19,700 --> 04:40:22,480
As a baby we got first place!

7486
04:40:26,580 --> 04:40:28,100
I can't believe it!

7487
04:40:28,240 --> 04:40:29,420
I beat two players!

7488
04:40:29,980 --> 04:40:31,460
I beat a red!

7489
04:40:31,640 --> 04:40:34,320
That man was ten ranks above me!

7490
04:40:35,060 --> 04:40:39,300
And I knew like two combos... I barely knew a combo to be fair.

7491
04:40:39,460 --> 04:40:44,840
I only knew three moves and I beat a red!

7492
04:40:45,100 --> 04:40:47,740
And I beat a fellow king main!

7493
04:40:47,900 --> 04:40:52,800
And she's been playing king and tekken far longer than me!

7494
04:40:55,640 --> 04:40:59,020
And I did it while talking!

7495
04:41:02,020 --> 04:41:05,520
I did it while being distracted!

7496
04:41:06,400 --> 04:41:06,980
Guys!

7497
04:41:07,060 --> 04:41:08,840
I wasn't focused up!

7498
04:41:09,100 --> 04:41:13,520
I fucking did that shit with no thoughts in my head!

7499
04:41:14,860 --> 04:41:20,180
It's all about instincts and pressing the square!

7500
04:41:21,240 --> 04:41:21,980
Guys!

7501
04:41:22,040 --> 04:41:23,800
They can't analyze me!

7502
04:41:24,020 --> 04:41:26,140
I barely have anything to analyze!

7503
04:41:28,800 --> 04:41:32,140
The yadding is channeled into kinks.

7504
04:41:33,120 --> 04:41:34,260
Oh my god.

7505
04:41:34,320 --> 04:41:39,760
I actually did not expect to win any games at all to be fair!

7506
04:41:39,940 --> 04:41:40,680
I went in!

7507
04:41:40,720 --> 04:41:42,260
I was so nervous!

7508
04:41:42,580 --> 04:41:43,840
I was so nervous!

7509
04:41:44,020 --> 04:41:45,200
I was so scared!

7510
04:41:45,720 --> 04:41:47,900
I was like... well I wasn't like scared!

7511
04:41:48,140 --> 04:41:51,820
I was just like... I'm just going in with just to have fun Doki!

7512
04:41:52,060 --> 04:41:53,340
Just to have fun!

7513
04:41:53,640 --> 04:41:55,880
There's no way you're gonna win any of these matches!

7514
04:41:56,240 --> 04:41:57,320
They're so good!

7515
04:41:57,540 --> 04:41:59,520
Everybody's been grinding longer than me!

7516
04:42:00,380 --> 04:42:02,660
And then I won two!

7517
04:42:02,980 --> 04:42:06,100
And I got a I got a round off SK!

7518
04:42:06,480 --> 04:42:07,920
And that's all that matters!

7519
04:42:07,980 --> 04:42:08,700
Did I get two rounds?

7520
04:42:08,880 --> 04:42:10,640
I got two rounds off SK!

7521
04:42:10,960 --> 04:42:12,240
I was so happy!

7522
04:42:12,480 --> 04:42:16,500
I don't know if SK if she was like playing nice to me or anything.

7523
04:42:16,680 --> 04:42:19,580
I don't know if she was like being nice to me in the first two rounds.

7524
04:42:19,820 --> 04:42:21,660
But like I take those!

7525
04:42:21,860 --> 04:42:22,520
I take those!

7526
04:42:22,600 --> 04:42:24,540
Cause she has like a hundred plus hours.

7527
04:42:24,780 --> 04:42:26,640
I have like 10 to 15.

7528
04:42:28,180 --> 04:42:33,180
I have I have a bunch of matches!

7529
04:42:34,120 --> 04:42:35,360
Oh my god!

7530
04:42:36,000 --> 04:42:36,880
It's crazy!

7531
04:42:38,200 --> 04:42:39,500
I had a lot of fun guys!

7532
04:42:39,800 --> 04:42:41,740
Just so you guys know this is round robin one.

7533
04:42:41,920 --> 04:42:47,280
We got we got like one... we got first place on day one.

7534
04:42:47,420 --> 04:42:48,480
There's two more days.

7535
04:42:48,600 --> 04:42:49,660
There's round robin two.

7536
04:42:50,000 --> 04:42:51,520
And then there's the finals.

7537
04:42:51,840 --> 04:42:53,920
So we have two more days.

7538
04:42:54,040 --> 04:42:55,060
Finals is on Sunday.

7539
04:42:55,140 --> 04:42:56,120
That's why it's not on my schedule.

7540
04:42:56,460 --> 04:42:57,720
But we're in first place!

7541
04:42:57,880 --> 04:42:58,720
We got first!

7542
04:42:59,340 --> 04:42:59,760
Yeah!

7543
04:43:02,380 --> 04:43:03,580
I've been streaming for four...

7544
04:43:03,580 --> 04:43:05,880
This does not feel like four hours.

7545
04:43:06,000 --> 04:43:06,820
I really like my teammates.

7546
04:43:07,120 --> 04:43:11,320
I really like Slimeconey, BrawPro, and Madman.

7547
04:43:11,480 --> 04:43:13,060
They were so fucking hype.

7548
04:43:13,680 --> 04:43:15,800
Our team was totally the vibes team.

7549
04:43:16,020 --> 04:43:17,980
Cause we're all just talking all the time.

7550
04:43:19,240 --> 04:43:20,340
And I love that.

7551
04:43:20,540 --> 04:43:20,960
I love that.

7552
04:43:20,980 --> 04:43:22,580
We're not like taking it super seriously.

7553
04:43:23,060 --> 04:43:24,200
But we're still winning.

7554
04:43:24,400 --> 04:43:27,180
Even though we weren't taking it super seriously, we were still winning.

7555
04:43:27,380 --> 04:43:29,440
We were yapping all the time too.

7556
04:43:30,140 --> 04:43:31,020
Um... yeah.

7557
04:43:31,920 --> 04:43:35,400
My favorite part was when I was like, eat his ass!

7558
04:43:35,760 --> 04:43:37,300
And I don't remember who it was.

7559
04:43:37,340 --> 04:43:38,880
It was like with a spoon!

7560
04:43:40,760 --> 04:43:43,340
I don't even know who said that.

7561
04:43:45,520 --> 04:43:47,340
The content team.

7562
04:43:52,320 --> 04:43:53,700
Grab a spoon.

7563
04:43:54,600 --> 04:43:55,440
Scoop it up!

7564
04:43:57,660 --> 04:43:58,480
And then...

7565
04:43:58,480 --> 04:44:01,140
I was like, they're like, won!

7566
04:44:01,380 --> 04:44:02,680
And so it was like, hold square!

7567
04:44:02,800 --> 04:44:03,520
I was like, square!

7568
04:44:03,740 --> 04:44:05,080
I know what square is!

7569
04:44:05,480 --> 04:44:06,000
But yeah.

7570
04:44:06,180 --> 04:44:07,400
Had a great time.

7571
04:44:07,940 --> 04:44:09,380
I had a great...

7572
04:44:09,780 --> 04:44:11,960
I had a great time with everybody.

7573
04:44:12,360 --> 04:44:12,820
Hey guys!

7574
04:44:12,940 --> 04:44:13,740
I'm gonna call it here!

7575
04:44:14,060 --> 04:44:15,260
I hope you guys had a fun time watching.

7576
04:44:15,480 --> 04:44:19,520
