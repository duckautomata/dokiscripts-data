1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,720
He's the content creator!

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,440
Yeah, he's the fucking content creator!

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,980
Bro, that guy was scary in Overwatch and scary in Apex!

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,660
Oh, that's true.

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,380
Yeah, he's creating content by killing us.

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,520
Yeah, that's the content!

7
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,680
Our content is dying to Selly.

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,160
Wait, wait, we know where he's landing!

9
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,080
We can just rotate away from Selly!

10
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:29,780
That's it!

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,560
Or we just go into them and just kill them.

12
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,260
And just feed them.

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,820
Just feed them kill points.

14
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:39,520
Let's get... oh.

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,180
Okay, do you guys know... I don't even look at where we're landing.

16
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,700
We're team one.

17
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,440
Oh, wait.

18
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:49,100
Somewhere.

19
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,200
We're landing somewhere.

20
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,600
Thank you, Yuris.

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,580
I believe in us.

22
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:54,660
Yeah.

23
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,660
Even more now.

24
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,580
Wait, which map do we have?

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,820
Solo mode, duo mode, trio mode.

26
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,580
All right, trio mode.

27
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,980
Wait, is it only Storm Point for trios?

28
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,260
No, I'm pretty sure we have different... there's no way it's only Storm Point.

29
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,220
I think we played it once.

30
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,680
I'm pretty sure we're rotating maps, right guys?

31
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,540
Oh, we have world's end.

32
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,440
We have world's end.

33
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,100
There's like, there's no way.

34
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,640
All right, we're landing... we are landing staging.

35
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:24,660
That is...

36
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:25,240
That is not bad.

37
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,920
Wouldn't call it the best landing spot.

38
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,060
Where are the teams next to us?

39
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,360
We have something.

40
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,780
Where are the teams next to us?

41
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:32,180
We have...

42
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,720
1Tap, we have...

43
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,300
Oh, okay.

44
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,320
Tatsuki and Hesuko.

45
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,680
Two Japanese pros, pretty much.

46
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:39,140
Okay.

47
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,540
That's great to hear, man.

48
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,200
I feel so motivated.

49
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,540
1Tap and Kohaku.

50
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,260
A pro and a predator.

51
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,760
And someone else.

52
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,500
We have 11.

53
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,340
Who's 11?

54
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:52,960
Yukio...

55
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,800
Who the fuck?

56
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:01,400
Ok, great!

57
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,880
Well, then...

58
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,940
Okay, I think we've reached our seated level.

59
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,340
What's your, your, your 2019?

60
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,300
Do you want to go first?

61
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,940
Ya, maybe?

62
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,200
I haven't removed everything we've used on this point where it's like...

63
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,400
Okay...

64
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,340
No, those zones are fucked.

65
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:28,580
Yeah, I had like Jen on my team and like, and then it was like in the fucking open.

66
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,680
And like, the end zones were so bad.

67
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:44,410
I haven't played this game in a while, so I'm just gonna be in the back, just chillin'.

68
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,990
Yeah, you're our IGL.

69
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:49,470
If we die, it's just poor IGL-ing, right?

70
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,970
Yeah, it's not my fault.

71
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,190
It's our fault.

72
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,170
Yeah, I'm used to it.

73
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,130
Trust me, I'm used to it.

74
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,530
It's just poor IGL-ing, that's it.

75
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:02,610
It's not because we're washed as fuck, it's because we're in it.

76
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,230
No, why would that be the case, bro?

77
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,930
If I didn't call that, we wouldn't have been in that situation.

78
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:15,170
That's right, I believe in us.

79
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,970
I believe in us not being last.

80
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,510
I'm gonna go in with like...

81
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:21,750
Super low expectations.

82
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,510
As long as we're not last.

83
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,310
That... yeah, exactly.

84
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,530
Yeah, as long as like, you know, we're not...

85
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,390
I like that, I like that.

86
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,870
We don't die 20th place.

87
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:35,230
Some other poor team dies 20th place, and it's not us.

88
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,170
That's just fine.

89
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,970
We're cheering, we're cheering, we're up in a beer.

90
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:39,670
That's a win, yeah, yeah, yeah.

91
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,770
We're not...

92
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:44,230
Yeah, that's a fucking win for me.

93
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,230
That is a win for me, you know?

94
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:49,330
You know what, let's make that our goal, you know?

95
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:58,030
Yeah, I just remembered, like, you know, like, when I saw, like, the landing spots announcements, I was like, ah, okay, what's Yuris doing right now?

96
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:01,490
And I see you fucking playing Overwatch, I was like, that seems right.

97
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:12,630
Yeah, I'm like, my GL in pro is super fucking locked in, let's go.

98
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:14,590
Exactly.

99
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,570
See, I've heard it from the previous rank number one in Apex.

100
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:19,610
Just play Overwatch.

101
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,490
If you wanna aim train.

102
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:22,210
That's true.

103
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:26,210
A lot of, like, the ex-Apex players are Overwatch players.

104
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,090
I mean, Selly was an ex-Overwatch player.

105
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,470
Yeah, exactly.

106
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:30,950
Yeah.

107
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,050
Yeah, too.

108
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,570
You're the ex-Overwatch player.

109
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,770
I remember I used to watch you in Overwatch.

110
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,190
Wait, truth!

111
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,410
I am tired.

112
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,470
Hey, yeah!

113
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,390
Wait a second, we have a chance!

114
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:42,390
Wait!

115
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,570
We have our own Selly.

116
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:46,090
Except...

117
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:46,530
Let's go!

118
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,190
Exactly.

119
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,550
Except the original Selly.

120
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,150
I mean, Selly might be better, but like, we have our own Selly.

121
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,250
That guy might have been pro, you know?

122
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:59,550
I'm not too sure, I'm not well versed, but I think we could beat him.

123
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,650
Yeah, yeah.

124
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,430
We have our own Selly.

125
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:02,950
Like in a 1v3, maybe?

126
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,050
In a 1v3, perhaps?

127
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:05,870
Yeah, yeah.

128
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:11,670
We just gotta make sure he's alone, and then if we all shoot him at the same time, like, we can take down...

129
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:14,050
Like, he's not the pro in his team, but like, that's okay.

130
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:16,770
He's content creating.

131
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,490
Yeah, he's a content creator.

132
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,050
Like, bro, it should be easy.

133
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:20,570
He's content creating.

134
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:21,170
Yeah, yeah.

135
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:23,290
Our team is like the content team.

136
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,070
At this point, we're the content team.

137
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:29,710
Oh, shit.

138
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:31,550
Alright.

139
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:32,870
You guys excited?

140
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,230
Wait, what map are we on?

141
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:34,770
I don't even...

142
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:35,290
Oh, World's Edge.

143
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:35,670
Okay.

144
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:37,010
Alright.

145
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,950
How good is your zone reading, Yuris?

146
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,290
I don't think we should ask that.

147
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:42,890
It's pretty good.

148
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:43,650
Oh, really?

149
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:44,530
But like...

150
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,190
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

151
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:45,330
But like...

152
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,830
You're like, it's pretty shit.

153
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,470
I don't think we should ask that.

154
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:48,710
Yeah, no.

155
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:49,430
We're just like, what the fuck, Dino?

156
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:50,250
Dino.

157
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,050
What the fuck?

158
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,190
He's right, G.S.

159
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:54,410
Hello?

160
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,510
I thought we were like, just letting it go.

161
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:57,850
Like...

162
00:05:58,470 --> 00:05:59,550
Not last place?

163
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,090
Like...

164
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,690
That's like a game.

165
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,290
Yuris, I believe in you.

166
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:08,890
But like, the zones have been pulling like, really fucking bad.

167
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,390
Are you like the zone reader for your team, Yuris?

168
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,090
Yeah, pretty much.

169
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,150
I pretty much just did everything on my...

170
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:18,450
I mean...

171
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,110
The latest ALGS team.

172
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,230
Oh shit.

173
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:21,670
You did everything?

174
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:27,970
Yeah, the IGLing, the entry, the zone read.

175
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,450
The mental care?

176
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,170
How's your mental?

177
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:39,250
Yeah, the mental care was like half of ALGS and then after that half of it's like, I was broken.

178
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:42,230
I needed someone else to do the mental care.

179
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:46,930
Yeah, that's why you got... after pro league you went to Overwatch.

180
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,770
The best game for mental...

181
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,290
And guess what?

182
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,630
That did not help.

183
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:55,910
Yeah, I was gonna say Overwatch is not known for mental care.

184
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:56,550
Just saying.

185
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:06,710
It's like if you play it too much you either become very immune to toxicity or you become the toxicity.

186
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,950
Oh yeah, that's so true.

187
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,210
That's a good way to put it.

188
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

189
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:16,810
Cause I know that people will be like, yeah I came from Overwatch.

190
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:20,030
And you're like, oh, I get it man.

191
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,290
Should I be this dude's friend?

192
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:24,610
That's so true.

193
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,770
Oh my god, that's so true.

194
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,890
It's like which part of Overwatch?

195
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:33,810
The really bad side or the good one?

196
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:35,050
Which Overwatch player are you?

197
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:39,250
Which Overwatch... which type of Overwatch player are you?

198
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,990
At least you didn't come from NA Valorant.

199
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:42,210
I don't know.

200
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:47,570
I don't know if like JP Valorant is any better but like NA Valorant is a whole new side of toxicity.

201
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:48,650
Um...

202
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,310
I remember playing in beta in NA.

203
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:53,030
That was funny.

204
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:54,690
It's kinda a thing.

205
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:58,090
It's like you just breathe and they start like roasting you.

206
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,450
Oh, true, true.

207
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:10,230
My first day on NA Valorant I got called a gamer word and I was like, alright, I'm just gonna mute everything.

208
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:11,450
I'm just kidding.

209
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,550
Why so fast?

210
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:19,430
I literally... I just like literally said one word and I was like, well, time to mute everybody.

211
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:20,770
Goodbye.

212
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,070
Goodbye NA Valorant.

213
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:23,690
Goodbye.

214
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:34,670
Yeah, you see, actually I've been playing a lot of Japanese or Japan servers in Valorant and it's not... not like... it's not that bad to be honest.

215
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:41,430
It's just no one... no one is like... it's rare to like play with a, you know, a toxic loud game.

216
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:44,370
But they have their own way of like trolling.

217
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,230
They have their own way of being toxic.

218
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:46,750
Like how so?

219
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,850
They're just passive aggressive.

220
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,630
Like how so?

221
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:51,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

222
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:55,170
They talk at like the last second of the game.

223
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,550
Like when you already lost.

224
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,830
Like when you leave the lobby.

225
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:02,550
With the sound like, you suck.

226
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:03,490
Fuck you.

227
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,110
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

228
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,130
Yeah, exactly.

229
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:06,650
Exactly.

230
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,710
They just hold it in until the last minute.

231
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,110
They're like, I'm never gonna see you anyway.

232
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,190
Yeah, yeah.

233
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:14,190
Oh my god.

234
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,130
That's how they do it here in Japan.

235
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:16,970
Oh my god.

236
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,310
I mean, I mean that's better.

237
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,610
That's better than like getting yelled at in the beginning.

238
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:23,670
That's true.

239
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:27,490
Just like, you know, cause like in Valorant you can't leave.

240
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:36,790
You can't leave until like somebody surrenders or like, or like you have to play the full game of someone yelling at you.

241
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:39,170
At least they save it till the end, you know?

242
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:40,930
Yeah.

243
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:41,990
Yeah, exactly.

244
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,030
That's true.

245
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:43,890
That is true.

246
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:45,750
Alright, alright.

247
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,510
Do you guys know what team?

248
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:51,850
Okay, so we're playing Bloodhound, Bangalore, and Wadian?

249
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,050
And Valkyrie.

250
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,410
Do you play Bloodhound, Doki?

251
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,190
Okay, I can play... wait, okay, but I'm not on controller.

252
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,770
But like no one in Asia is really on controller.

253
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:02,470
So...

254
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:04,850
It's not like NA.

255
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,110
Oh no, there's actually a lot.

256
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,430
There's actually a lot more than you think.

257
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:10,910
I think it's more... everyone in Korea is more like...

258
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:12,190
Everyone in Korea doesn't play controller.

259
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,930
Oh, that's true.

260
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:14,650
Yeah, yeah.

261
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:19,570
Yeah, but I think like in NA it's almost like... it's every team has like a ruler player.

262
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:19,990
Oh, yes.

263
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:20,530
Yeah.

264
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,270
Yeah.

265
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:26,910
Yeah, so like, you know, NA tournaments are so scary.

266
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:33,290
I'll be like, hey, I'm the MNK player here.

267
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:34,290
Hello.

268
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,490
Please be nice.

269
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:37,530
Then I already have the disadvantage.

270
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:38,730
Disadvantage.

271
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:44,810
Sorry, my team is... sorry for being a... sorry for being a nerf for your team.

272
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,790
I have the wrong input.

273
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:50,930
You can usually play.

274
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:51,850
I can play.

275
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,330
Do you go by Doki or like...

276
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,050
Doki.

277
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,490
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

278
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:58,970
Alright, alright.

279
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,610
I can't... I just not Valk.

280
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,910
I can do either Blood or... Blood or Bang.

281
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:05,410
Blood or Bang.

282
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:06,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

283
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:08,630
I play... I play Bang and Nen.

284
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:09,910
Okay, I do Blood.

285
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,410
Just yell at me.

286
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,090
Just micromanage me for scans.

287
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:17,210
Just watch a little clip, you know, like a little VOD review.

288
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:18,650
A little VOD?

289
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:19,530
We're having a VOD review?

290
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:20,450
We're gonna do VOD review?

291
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,970
Right before a tournament, you know.

292
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:25,190
That's when you should VOD review probably.

293
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,510
What VOD?

294
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:29,270
Let's see.

295
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:32,610
DSG is playing Bloodhound Caustic Wraith.

296
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:33,810
Alright, that's interesting.

297
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:35,490
That's already interesting.

298
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,930
That's already something different.

299
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:40,050
Okay, but DSG is like Metacrashers.

300
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,750
Caustic seems to be the meta.

301
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:46,890
Yeah, I see about Caustic now because of like how f*** the zones are.

302
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,950
So they have to like have Caustic to zone out things.

303
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,470
Oh...

304
00:11:54,830 --> 00:12:00,110
The roller player is usually on the Bloodhound, but like since we don't have a roller player...

305
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:03,790
I've never held a controller in my life, man.

306
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,150
Like actually.

307
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:12,930
I bought a $500 controller and I used it like... and I only used it for not Apex.

308
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:16,910
You know those Battle Beaver controllers that every f***ing Apex pro advertises?

309
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,370
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

310
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:26,490
I used it like one time for Apex and then every other time it's just for other games that need controller.

311
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:28,890
I can't.

312
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,090
I don't know how to do it.

313
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,310
It's so difficult.

314
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,950
I can't either, bro.

315
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:36,370
I get so mad when I'm using controller.

316
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:38,150
Like why the f*** am I so bad?

317
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:43,270
It's like I touch a controller and it's like...

318
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,870
Alright, I'm going back to MBK.

319
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,050
GG's.

320
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:47,030
It's so hard.

321
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:48,090
I don't...

322
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:48,970
But then like...

323
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:52,610
But then when it hits, when that aim assist hits though, oh my god.

324
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,350
And I'm like...

325
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,790
I can't go back!

326
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,030
Yeah, when it hits it...

327
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:57,810
When it hits it hits.

328
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:58,590
Yeah, when it hits it hits.

329
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:03,930
Like one out of ten fights you miss everything or...

330
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:06,910
Like nine out of ten fights you miss everything in that one fight.

331
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,210
You just one clip every time.

332
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,630
Yeah, and then you're like, oh controller's OP!

333
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,270
What the f*** is this bullshit?

334
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,850
And that was a one out of ten.

335
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,210
Aim assist is broken!

336
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,890
From what I've observed, we should play...

337
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,490
We should play Caustic.

338
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:27,630
Caustic?

339
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:28,030
Okay.

340
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:29,250
Not it.

341
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,110
Yeah.

342
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:31,990
I don't know what that is.

343
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,390
I don't...

344
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,510
I don't even think I have him unlocked, man.

345
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,150
Wait, you don't have Caustic...

346
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:36,670
Wait, what?

347
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,390
How do you not have Caustic unlocked?

348
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:40,490
That's just default, bro.

349
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,610
Ain't nothing I can do.

350
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:44,910
I think I have the different DLC, man.

351
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,490
Bro, I have a million ledger tokens.

352
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:50,090
How do you not have Caustic unlocked?

353
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,150
I don't think I got him, bro.

354
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,370
Oh my god.

355
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:59,290
Pookie, leave the lobby and unlock it right now.

356
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:02,370
It would be funny if you leave and they actually stop.

357
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:03,870
Oh, wait, you actually left.

358
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,190
Wait, where did you go?

359
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,630
I need to join the lobby.

360
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,490
I need to join the lobby.

361
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:08,410
I was just shooting them bots.

362
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:09,810
Oh, we were waiting.

363
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:10,150
Okay.

364
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:10,470
Holy shit.

365
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:10,870
Yeah.

366
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:11,950
Just so you know.

367
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,410
Just so you know.

368
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:17,370
You were definitely the last person.

369
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:18,910
Yeah, yeah.

370
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:20,990
Heroes come late, you know?

371
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:22,030
No, I'm sorry.

372
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:22,130
No, I'm sorry.

373
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:22,530
No, I'm sorry.

374
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:22,670
No, I'm sorry.

375
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:23,590
It's okay.

376
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,090
It's okay.

377
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:27,290
It's okay.

378
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:27,850
Some people...

379
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:31,750
Does that one guy have that wheel so that he loaded in last?

380
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:32,350
No, I'm sorry.

381
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:32,990
Yeah, technically.

382
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:35,990
We were like...

383
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,230
We were like...

384
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,170
Oh my god.

385
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,890
We literally started because you joined.

386
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:43,930
Oh my god.

387
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:44,810
I'm so sorry.

388
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:45,490
Oh shit.

389
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:46,230
I'm so sorry.

390
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:49,650
I was literally just tap scraping around a bot.

391
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,370
To find this.

392
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:54,710
All right, wait.

393
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,190
I'll play Bang.

394
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:59,270
You can play Bloodhound, Dohki.

395
00:14:59,470 --> 00:14:59,790
Okay.

396
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:00,970
And Tayo, you can play...

397
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:01,850
You can play...

398
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:02,350
Okay.

399
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,590
What am I playing?

400
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:04,730
You can play Valk.

401
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,270
I can play anything.

402
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:08,330
We'll do that.

403
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,150
I can play anything.

404
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,930
Give me a character name.

405
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:16,730
We just did.

406
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,110
We literally said Valk.

407
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:21,230
Just give me a character name.

408
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:22,030
We did.

409
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,610
We told you to play Valk.

410
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:25,910
Valk.

411
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:26,750
I wanna play Valk.

412
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,830
It's like, play Valk.

413
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:30,490
Give me anything.

414
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:31,490
I can play anything.

415
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:32,210
Valk.

416
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:32,750
Anything.

417
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:33,870
Anything.

418
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,010
But caustic.

419
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:42,530
But caustic.

420
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,170
But caustic.

421
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:46,070
Wait, what the fuck?

422
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:46,750
Why aren't we starting?

423
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:49,330
Someone's restarting.

424
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,450
Look, it wasn't you.

425
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,810
See, I wasn't the last person.

426
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,850
See, it wouldn't have mattered.

427
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,010
I saw this coming.

428
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,130
Even if you joined early.

429
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,370
It's never your fault.

430
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,530
Just remember that.

431
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:06,650
As a competitive player, it's never your fault.

432
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:08,030
And always somebody else's fault.

433
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,850
Yeah, it's never my fault.

434
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,310
I'm sorry if we lose today, but it's not my fault.

435
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:12,790
Yeah, sorry.

436
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:13,470
It was ping.

437
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,030
It was ping.

438
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,110
Bad RGL.

439
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,550
Bad RNG.

440
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,250
Battle Royale.

441
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:22,170
RNG.

442
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:27,450
No, there's this guy called fucking all wingman please.

443
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,150
This dude is locked in.

444
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:30,110
Really?

445
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:33,590
This guy is supposed to be fucking punching the entire game.

446
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:37,870
He's gonna use the P2020, bro.

447
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:42,690
Oh my god.

448
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,610
You're the competitor, bro.

449
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:46,970
You probably have to be fighting that guy for your wingman.

450
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,510
Yeah, I'm sorry, but...

451
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,910
You see a wingman package and you know he's there.

452
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:53,070
He's gonna be across the map heading for it.

453
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,750
It's gonna be me, Selly, and this guy.

454
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,090
All fucking carefree.

455
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:57,650
Yeah, yeah.

456
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:00,890
There's always like three teams fighting for fucking packs.

457
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,330
Wait, how is team one fair?

458
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,450
What the fuck?

459
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,170
We're team one.

460
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,510
I'm hyping us up.

461
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:09,590
I'm hyping us up, guys.

462
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:11,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

463
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:14,570
Oh my god, team one.

464
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:16,810
Team one?

465
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,930
What the fuck is wrong with team one?

466
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,470
Don't look at my badges.

467
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:25,510
But like what the fuck is wrong with team one?

468
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:26,710
But like what the fuck is wrong with team one?

469
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:29,910
So technically we didn't count.

470
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,830
This starts from team two.

471
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:32,630
Team one.

472
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:33,650
Team two?

473
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,130
Like goddamn.

474
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:34,930
What the fuck?

475
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:39,730
Okay, team two is actually pretty scary though.

476
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:44,570
I'm pretty sure Tokotoa is also really good.

477
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:45,090
I'm pretty sure Tokotoa is also really good.

478
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,250
Yeah, Toa is pretty good.

479
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:48,450
Holy shit.

480
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:51,930
I remember always meeting her in these...

481
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:52,810
I remember always meeting her in these...

482
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

483
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,650
Wait, did you just say performance?

484
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:57,150
This is a fun tournament.

485
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,410
I'm here dead serious.

486
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,390
You're so... yeah, yeah.

487
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:03,990
You're so... when was the last time you streamed Apex, Tayo?

488
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,550
How serious are you?

489
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,450
Like two hours ago.

490
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,790
Like, okay, before today.

491
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:10,550
Before today.

492
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,730
Like a year ago.

493
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,570
Wait, I'm gonna look up your Twitch bots right now.

494
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,850
What do you mean, like a year ago?

495
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:23,650
A year ago.

496
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,490
My aim is pretty on point.

497
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:27,330
You're right, you're right.

498
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:29,110
Overwatch aim travels...

499
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,410
You were literally streaming Overwatch yesterday.

500
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,670
Bro, I'm looking at your bots.

501
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:41,990
You have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

502
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,150
Bro, how long does the Overwatch go?

503
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:46,030
Every day.

504
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:46,590
I'm ready.

505
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:47,210
I'm watching.

506
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:53,330
Bro, 24 days ago you were on Apex.

507
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:53,630
24 days ago you were on Apex.

508
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:56,150
Oh yeah, no, for the tournament.

509
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,390
For what tournament?

510
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:02,770
The one where Uri's got like 30 kills.

511
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:04,110
Oh shit.

512
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,530
Oh yeah, that tournament.

513
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:07,570
Okay, redo it.

514
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:08,870
Replicate that.

515
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:10,010
That was a hard warm up for this tournament.

516
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,210
Yeah, I got you.

517
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:13,610
We need you to do that again.

518
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,130
Yeah, I was speaking Japanese that time.

519
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,570
Maybe we can do it better.

520
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:21,010
You know, since I'm on English mode now.

521
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:21,990
Oh, you're right.

522
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,630
Just think you're... Just think you're...

523
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:24,510
I think you're in Pro League again.

524
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,230
If we lose, blame it on the IGL.

525
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:26,870
Exactly.

526
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:28,490
Don't worry, you don't need to tell me that.

527
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:29,670
I was going to anyway.

528
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:31,750
Yeah, that was a shit.

529
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,230
I don't know what you're on about, but...

530
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:36,910
Don't worry, I'm so ahead of you.

531
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,270
I was ready to blame you if we lose.

532
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,530
Wait, wait, are you in...

533
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:42,450
Uri's, are you in...

534
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,270
Are you in Japan now?

535
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:46,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

536
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:47,810
I'm in Japan now.

537
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:51,790
So you have the JP ping too.

538
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:52,550
Oh, thank god.

539
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:52,790
Alright.

540
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,730
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly.

541
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:59,310
Oh yeah, you have like 120, 30, 40, 50, 60, right?

542
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:02,950
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

543
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:04,530
He was just like, what?

544
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,810
Wait, no, no, he's asking... Wait, are you asking me?

545
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:10,330
No, no, no, Doki, Doki.

546
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,350
Oh no, I'm on...

547
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,650
Oh, I thought you were asking Uri's.

548
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:15,070
No, I'm on a fucking a hundred and...

549
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,450
a hundred and twenty ping.

550
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:23,050
Yeah, I get this... I get the same amount of ping to Japan to East Coast.

551
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:26,810
That's how fucked... that's how fucked it is.

552
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,790
Are the servers that bad?

553
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:32,970
Like, West to East, and oh, it's like 60, like 50 ping.

554
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:33,930
Yeah, no, it's so true!

555
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:35,450
I was like, what the fuck?

556
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:40,090
I literally get like, almost the same ping from East to Tokyo.

557
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:40,970
It's actually crazy.

558
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,070
So I'm like, it's fine.

559
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,410
It's fine.

560
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:46,990
It's fine.

561
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:47,970
It's fine.

562
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:49,830
The house is burning down, but it's fine.

563
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:50,450
It's fine.

564
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:51,370
I might have to...

565
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:52,730
It's actually crazy.

566
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:59,110
I have never played a tournament in Apex from NA with less than a hundred ping.

567
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,830
I've always had a hundred ping in tournaments.

568
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,370
Even in NA servers.

569
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:04,210
How?

570
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,610
I know, bro.

571
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:09,050
Bro, it's just West Coast debuff.

572
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:10,930
It's just...

573
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:14,650
We actually nerfed by default.

574
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:18,510
There's like nobody ever puts servers in West Coast.

575
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:21,610
It's always in East Coast.

576
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:22,830
It's always, yeah.

577
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:25,130
It's literally West Coast debuff.

578
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:27,790
Or just West Coast Canadians debuff.

579
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:30,350
Oh, we're starting.

580
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:30,630
What the fuck?

581
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:31,050
Oh, yeah, okay.

582
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,110
Bloodhound.

583
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:34,130
I'm so locked in.

584
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,290
Wait, where are we landing here?

585
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:39,570
Staging.

586
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:40,190
Staging.

587
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:41,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

588
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,210
That's like a left of harvest.

589
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:44,770
Oh, 2k?

590
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:46,230
Yeah, yeah.

591
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:47,170
Yeah, dude.

592
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:48,230
Let's go.

593
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,610
Where the fuck is Bloodhound?

594
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:49,990
Alright.

595
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,990
Oh, there you go.

596
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:55,110
Valkyrie, Valkyrie, Valkyrie.

597
00:21:59,050 --> 00:21:59,490
Alright.

598
00:21:59,490 --> 00:21:59,930
Bloodhound.

599
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:00,930
What do I upgrade?

600
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:01,710
What do I upgrade?

601
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:02,390
Oh, wait, shit.

602
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:02,710
You're right.

603
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:03,190
What do I upgrade?

604
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,130
Wait, guys.

605
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,730
I can't ICL that far.

606
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:07,350
Hold on.

607
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:10,410
You supposed to put micro and macro us.

608
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:11,550
Holy shit.

609
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:13,590
The one... Okay.

610
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,790
Tayo, you upgrade the one that lets you fly like higher.

611
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:18,470
And you just go...

612
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:25,230
Doki, you upgrade the one for... the scan lasts longer and...

613
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:26,890
What the fuck?

614
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:27,610
What else?

615
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:28,970
Wait, there's Raven?

616
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:29,950
There's the one on the left, I think.

617
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:30,090
Oh, wait.

618
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:31,010
Odin's glare?

619
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:33,030
Or the Raven?

620
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:33,510
Yeah, something like that.

621
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:33,910
Or the Raven?

622
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:34,210
Yeah, something like that.

623
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:39,450
I think you loot Mirage, Doki, so we can scan the beacon.

624
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:39,810
Me?

625
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:40,130
Okay.

626
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:42,150
Wait, is there anybody else?

627
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:43,750
No one else is in Mirage, right?

628
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,450
I'm not gonna get fucking run up on, right?

629
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:45,970
Nah, no one goes Mirage.

630
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:46,190
Yeah.

631
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:46,510
Alright.

632
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:49,770
If they do, I'll get them banned from Biggest Scars.

633
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:50,750
It's my team's stream.

634
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:53,990
You'll get them banned next year.

635
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:55,890
Yeah, I'll get them fucking banned.

636
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:59,710
But who's next to us, by the way?

637
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:00,790
We're gonna land right here.

638
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:03,290
Uh, right there... I forgot.

639
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:04,570
Alright.

640
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:05,070
It doesn't matter.

641
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:05,710
We're better.

642
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:06,730
Alright, it's okay.

643
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:08,890
You guys will pick up my banner, right?

644
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:09,850
If I die...

645
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:11,350
We'll be fine.

646
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:12,450
Yeah, we will.

647
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,250
We definitely will.

648
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,230
Yeah, yeah.

649
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,310
We don't have any crafting legends, by the way.

650
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:18,490
Just so you guys remember.

651
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:20,830
So you have to pick me up.

652
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:22,750
Alright.

653
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:24,870
Alright.

654
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,230
If you guys see a...

655
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:26,950
Actually, no.

656
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:27,810
You guys are so far.

657
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:30,510
I want not travel back to all of you.

658
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:32,930
Should I get a repeater?

659
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:35,490
I have a repeater.

660
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,830
Repeater's still busted, right?

661
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,490
There's a purple stock here.

662
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:38,750
Yeah.

663
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:41,610
I heard it's alright.

664
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:44,330
I heard Havoc is pretty fucking busted.

665
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:47,510
Havoc's really good.

666
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:50,150
I'm gonna grab that.

667
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:55,550
I'm just gonna wait for a hemlock or some shit.

668
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,070
Gonna start the party.

669
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,500
Ooh.

670
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,380
Party started!

671
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,320
Let's see.

672
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,920
It's looking like a little eastern zone.

673
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:14,800
Somewhere...

674
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,240
Oh.

675
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,640
Dude, I got my hammer from Mozambique.

676
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,480
That's it.

677
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,460
We're so locked in.

678
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:22,900
Nice.

679
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,020
Wait, that's actually low-key strong.

680
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,340
I'm not even joking.

681
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,960
Yeah, if you get a...

682
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,460
If you have a... What do you call this?

683
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:32,720
A digi threat?

684
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,720
You can fucking like... Oh, yeah.

685
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:34,920
Oh, yeah.

686
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,520
Cause it's on pistol zone now.

687
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

688
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:39,680
Oh, wait.

689
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,140
No, there you go.

690
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,520
I found a Havoc.

691
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:43,500
Alright.

692
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,400
Havoc on 120 ping.

693
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:45,880
Let's go.

694
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,720
Let me have time to charge it up.

695
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,980
There's a gold heavy mag right here.

696
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,800
Landslides already leaving.

697
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,080
Bro, what?

698
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:55,820
Okay.

699
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,160
They're... Wait.

700
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,060
I'm gonna...

701
00:24:59,060 --> 00:24:59,940
I guess...

702
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,040
I'm gonna go up.

703
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,140
I have three bats if anyone needs any.

704
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,540
Be careful.

705
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,980
Be careful of this team flying Taya.

706
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,100
They're flying towards... Yeah, yeah.

707
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,180
I'm running.

708
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:09,580
I'm running.

709
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,660
Oh, we have a point here.

710
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:13,600
I didn't realize.

711
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,780
I have like...

712
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,260
I have okay guns.

713
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,200
Do you need a heavy mag and stuff?

714
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,880
No, I'm using a bolt right now.

715
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,600
There's a flatline here.

716
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:22,900
Alright.

717
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,960
I'm gonna go grab the harvester.

718
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:28,900
Yeah.

719
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,240
And then I'll scan.

720
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,980
So we know where people are going.

721
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:34,500
Yup, yup.

722
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:34,700
It's okay.

723
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,700
I have no clue what you just said.

724
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,140
I agree.

725
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,740
I feel so confident.

726
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,740
There's no harvester.

727
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,220
Alright, I'm gonna go scan.

728
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,580
So we know where people are going.

729
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,880
I'm gonna get this bin here.

730
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,500
Yeah, we definitely need blue armor.

731
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,600
Oh, everybody's going here.

732
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:58,780
Yeah.

733
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,040
Can we have a good...

734
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,140
Can we have a good rotate here?

735
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,500
A good little rotate.

736
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,840
Start going back to staging.

737
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,020
Oh, staging?

738
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:07,480
Okay.

739
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,640
I got a hammer point for you.

740
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,220
Or a digi threat for you there.

741
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,320
Oh, thank you.

742
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:15,800
Thank you.

743
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:15,860
Yeah.

744
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:20,000
I think everybody is already setting up in harvester area.

745
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,560
Yeah, they're in harvester.

746
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,240
I think we keep staging here.

747
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,240
And like fight.

748
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,260
And just like slow rotate in.

749
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,620
Oh, hey, there's a...

750
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,680
There's a bug.

751
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,320
I have a faster reaction time.

752
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,060
Thank you.

753
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,960
Who gets the helmet?

754
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,380
I get it.

755
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:39,980
I get it for now.

756
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,040
Okay.

757
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,000
Alright, alright.

758
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,800
Oh, I've been right fighting already.

759
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,000
I hope they kill them off so not...

760
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,640
I can't see who...

761
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,860
I can't teabag.

762
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,280
Oh, you can't teabag?

763
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:55,640
It's okay.

764
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,140
The thing is you always teabag.

765
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,980
You always teabag.

766
00:26:58,980 --> 00:26:59,620
It doesn't matter who.

767
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,820
It doesn't matter who.

768
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:02,540
It's equality.

769
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,600
Alright, we'll chill right here.

770
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:08,900
Alright.

771
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,680
I feel so safe with my blue armor.

772
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,340
The team underneath us here isn't like an OP team, you know?

773
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:16,960
Oh, yeah.

774
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,780
We can handle everyone.

775
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,280
Yeah, yeah.

776
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,840
We can definitely handle everybody.

777
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,580
I 100% agree.

778
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,320
Yeah.

779
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,880
We can craft bats here too.

780
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:32,060
I have four bats if anyone needs more.

781
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,320
I have four bats if anyone needs more.

782
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,400
I need a sculpt.

783
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:37,160
I need a sculpt.

784
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,280
They're flying towards...

785
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:40,960
Oh, a tree.

786
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:41,640
Okay.

787
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:42,680
A tree?

788
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,920
That's interesting.

789
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,300
Wasn't the bot side heavily...

790
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,560
There's so many people, right?

791
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,220
Left side isn't looted.

792
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,140
We want to loot the left.

793
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,360
I'm going to scan this crow.

794
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,860
There's people too.

795
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,600
Should I get the ultimate accelerator?

796
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,160
You should, yeah.

797
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:00,620
Ultimate.

798
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,100
Ultimate accelerator is always good.

799
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,540
Do you need this?

800
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:06,540
No.

801
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,580
I have 2x.

802
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,340
Yeah, I like the...

803
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,820
...fucking stock scope.

804
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,220
There's a blue heavy here.

805
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:18,790
Where is another scan?

806
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:19,450
Oh, there's another...

807
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:20,990
The next scan we have is harvester.

808
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:22,830
The 30-30.

809
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:25,970
You know, fuck it.

810
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,150
I'm going to take the 30-30 too.

811
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:30,610
Come on, Nemesis Mozambique.

812
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,970
See where the zone is pulling.

813
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:35,450
Looks like a...

814
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:37,270
...lava siphon zone.

815
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:39,350
Where all those guys were flying.

816
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:42,090
Lava siphon?

817
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:42,790
I think so.

818
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:45,130
There was like 2 teams already stationed at lava.

819
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:46,390
Yeah.

820
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:49,750
I guess finding a stock.

821
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:51,250
Alright.

822
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:53,130
Actually, I'm going to craft a bat too.

823
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:55,670
I hope I don't get killed.

824
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,330
Dude, I'm so scared.

825
00:28:59,430 --> 00:28:59,810
I'm just like...

826
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:01,090
...near Yuris.

827
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:02,530
He's my daddy.

828
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:04,530
I'm just too scared.

829
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:06,810
Whoa!

830
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:08,790
Wait, stop.

831
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:09,510
To the right.

832
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:11,430
Wait, wait, wait.

833
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:13,090
I can't get to you guys yet.

834
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:13,950
I'm going to walk up.

835
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:17,690
Oh yeah, we have a really good spot.

836
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:18,390
I think we fight this.

837
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,150
I'm heading off to you guys.

838
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:22,670
Posture up.

839
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,770
I cracked the bloodhound.

840
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:25,410
I'm moving up left.

841
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,730
Moving up left and taking space.

842
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:29,210
Don't worry.

843
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:30,030
I'm 5 seconds away.

844
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:31,190
Inside the ship.

845
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:32,230
I'm here.

846
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:35,210
I don't have an angle.

847
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:36,250
I got an angle.

848
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:36,710
Cracked!

849
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:37,510
Cracked!

850
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:38,590
Nice, nice.

851
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,610
I have a good crosshair.

852
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:42,270
I'm bank-holding them too.

853
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:44,190
Wait, where did they go?

854
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:45,090
Are they still inside?

855
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,170
They're still inside.

856
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:49,130
They're running.

857
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:50,450
I'm good on me.

858
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:52,850
They took the zip.

859
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,250
I'm taking space.

860
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:55,190
Okay.

861
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:59,450
I'm looking to my right just in case a team walks up.

862
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:01,290
They're inside.

863
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:01,630
They're inside.

864
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:05,930
As long as we keep height, that's fine.

865
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,750
We're going to play for this side right here.

866
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:09,490
See my ping?

867
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:11,190
We're going to play for that height over there.

868
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,190
On the east side.

869
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:14,530
We just keep him on the low ground.

870
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:16,010
Oh my god, guys!

871
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:16,610
We're not last!

872
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:18,190
Somebody die!

873
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:19,570
We're done!

874
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:22,470
We're so fucking good.

875
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,590
We're so good at this game.

876
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:25,450
I'm going to scan thermal too.

877
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:26,170
I'm going to look.

878
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:27,410
Keep looking at the team and staging.

879
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,430
I'm going to look behind us.

880
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:30,750
I'll look at them.

881
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,510
I don't even see them inside.

882
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:34,690
Did they rotate out?

883
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:35,290
No, no.

884
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:36,510
They're on this side.

885
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:37,290
They're on the door.

886
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:38,790
I see them.

887
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:41,490
There's a team playing here on this side.

888
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:42,430
They're rotating out.

889
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:44,350
They're rotating now.

890
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:46,490
They smoked out.

891
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,290
They're going up to the zip.

892
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:51,450
I'm just...

893
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:53,890
Oh, they're getting shot at!

894
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:54,730
I have a caustic.

895
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:57,270
You were shooting them.

896
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:58,750
I was like, whoa!

897
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:00,770
They're getting shot at!

898
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:01,430
It's your reason!

899
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:03,250
They are getting shot at.

900
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:05,730
On the roof.

901
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,110
On the roof.

902
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:08,890
If there's more cells, let me know.

903
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:11,090
Right here.

904
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,830
They should...

905
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,330
They're not getting shot behind.

906
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:22,230
We can't really commit to this fight because there's a team behind this.

907
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,570
Oh, they're committing.

908
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:25,170
Okay.

909
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:29,830
Let them waste their bloodhound ult.

910
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,590
Just don't take too much damage.

911
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:32,770
Right there.

912
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:34,830
They're getting shot.

913
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:36,070
This time they are getting shot at.

914
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:37,610
Yep, yep.

915
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:38,850
Oh, god.

916
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:42,390
No ammo.

917
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,530
There's a team zipping to the village.

918
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:46,590
Oh, shit.

919
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:48,650
God rotate.

920
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:49,350
God damn.

921
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:51,630
Look at the fucking zip onto it.

922
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:54,770
Yeah, they just fucking...

923
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,990
I have a redeploy.

924
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,890
We have two redeploys, so we need it.

925
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:00,250
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

926
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:03,150
I don't want to use my...

927
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:03,850
I don't want to use my bullets.

928
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:08,150
I have four bats if anyone needs an extra bat.

929
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:08,830
We just chill.

930
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:10,110
We'll see how this zone pulls.

931
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,110
We don't have to do anything crazy.

932
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:14,430
We can even go in the tunnel if we have to.

933
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

934
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,690
We have the redeploy too.

935
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:17,690
We need to use it.

936
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,620
Keep scanning this team.

937
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,280
Yeah, I can.

938
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,000
I'll scan it now.

939
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,220
Yep.

940
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:27,940
Oh, my gosh.

941
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:28,660
They're bunkered up.

942
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,040
Yeah, they're heavily bunkered up.

943
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,800
They're like free shots anyway.

944
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:37,760
Yeah, they're like free shots anyway.

945
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,700
This guy right here.

946
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:46,500
If they push up here, I'm gonna smoke this and we're gonna run into the tunnel so we have better angles.

947
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,120
Oh, yeah.

948
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,120
You can even play up there.

949
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,240
I feel so safe.

950
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,040
They're running?

951
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,440
They're at the back door.

952
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,720
I'm scanning?

953
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,060
Oh, yeah.

954
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:56,740
They smoked back.

955
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,900
They're still in the house.

956
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:01,420
Oh, yeah.

957
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,700
We have a decent...

958
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:05,860
Wait.

959
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,140
I'm gonna check.

960
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,800
I'm gonna go to the tunnel right now.

961
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,520
I'm gonna check our rotate.

962
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,700
There's a team on height here.

963
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,200
Okay.

964
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,820
If we can somehow get to this fucking building.

965
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,380
These buildings here.

966
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,660
Wait, can we make it over here?

967
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:24,740
Yeah, we...

968
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,040
We buckled.

969
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,620
Right here?

970
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:29,460
Yeah.

971
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:29,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

972
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,600
I believe in your flying.

973
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,420
We're gonna go into the buildings here.

974
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,360
Go through here.

975
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,360
Go behind this.

976
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,320
Oh my god.

977
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,220
We're fucking flying.

978
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,760
Get into the buildings here.

979
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,480
Let's chill here for now.

980
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,460
This one?

981
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,400
Yeah, this one.

982
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,680
We have both these buildings.

983
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,880
I'm gonna watch behind.

984
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,840
No one should be in these buildings.

985
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,320
Just this team on the height.

986
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,360
I'm gonna go to the big one building.

987
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,960
Yeah, I'm watching our back.

988
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,400
Holy shit, that Valk.

989
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,080
That was clutch.

990
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,880
That was fucking clutch there.

991
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,440
Oh my god, look at you.

992
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,500
Look at your IGL go.

993
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,580
Alright, we're good.

994
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,580
We're good till next zone.

995
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,380
I'm acting surprised you're easy to do.

996
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,680
You don't believe in your Valk player?

997
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,600
You don't believe in your Valk player?

998
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,280
Shit, okay, I'm good.

999
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:20,560
I'm okay.

1000
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,240
Oh shit.

1001
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,340
It's the people that were trying to sandwich us, right?

1002
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,420
I knew it.

1003
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,140
I'm sure he's telling.

1004
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,580
I'm not fucking going under that roof anymore.

1005
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,600
That was scary.

1006
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:36,180
On this next zone close, no one should technically come from behind.

1007
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,900
Okay, I'm just gonna go and stay inside for now.

1008
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,060
They're still there.

1009
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:41,840
Let's check if there's a...

1010
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,960
If they start fighting there, we definitely push that.

1011
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,260
There's a guy right there.

1012
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,080
There's a guy right there.

1013
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,020
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1014
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:49,600
Fuck you.

1015
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:51,540
Looking?

1016
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,280
You lost the fucking Valkyrie fight.

1017
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,100
The rockin' duel.

1018
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,700
For the youth, like, hit yourself.

1019
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,360
No, no.

1020
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,560
I would never.

1021
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,140
Alright, here we go.

1022
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:08,030
I don't see them.

1023
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:08,570
Are they up this?

1024
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:09,910
Yeah, yeah, that's...

1025
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:13,270
Both of our teammates are like...

1026
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:15,990
watching the other side.

1027
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:19,050
If I have a 3x...

1028
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:22,310
I'm pretty sure... yeah, I was gonna say, it's definitely gonna pull here.

1029
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:24,430
Yeah, we're good, we're good.

1030
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:27,470
We have our... you're gonna have a Valk ult, right?

1031
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:28,470
Their Valk ult Valk?

1032
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:30,010
Oh yeah, let me just charge my thing.

1033
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,010
I forgot I had it.

1034
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:33,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1035
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:34,330
They might be pushing us.

1036
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:37,190
Oh yeah, they are, they are.

1037
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:38,490
Yeah, I scan, I scan, I scan.

1038
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:40,450
Alright, I'm Valk ulting, I'm Valk ulting.

1039
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:42,170
We play up, we play up, we play up.

1040
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:42,790
I'm inside,

1041
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:46,390
first floor.

1042
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:47,870
Oh, at me?

1043
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:50,550
I'm burning one, I'm burning one.

1044
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,070
I'm burning one.

1045
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,010
Flash, flash, flash, flash.

1046
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:55,670
I'm buffing the back, I'm buffing the back.

1047
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:58,550
Oh, fuck.

1048
00:35:59,190 --> 00:35:59,970
There's three right here.

1049
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:01,130
Oh, they're all flashed.

1050
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:02,630
I believe in you, Ryze.

1051
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:04,490
He's flash, he's flash, he's flash.

1052
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:06,230
He might be my bat though.

1053
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:08,950
He was here last time, but I don't know where he is now.

1054
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:11,630
I got sked here.

1055
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:14,070
I'm ping, I'm ping, I'm ping.

1056
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:14,670
He's arcing.

1057
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:16,170
I'm ulting right side.

1058
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:19,250
He's rezzing.

1059
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,550
They're rezzing, they're rezzing, they're rezzing.

1060
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:22,570
He's outside, he's outside.

1061
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:25,390
He's reloading, he's right here.

1062
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:26,430
I'm ping, I'm ping.

1063
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:29,570
He's peeking.

1064
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:30,850
He's going my side, he's on me.

1065
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:32,390
He's over here, he's over here.

1066
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,230
I'm better, I'm better.

1067
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:40,610
It's okay, guys.

1068
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:43,150
He knew it was gonna happen.

1069
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:43,710
Zone?

1070
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:47,530
We're gonna reset, we're gonna back ult instantly.

1071
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:48,790
Just pop a medkit, Kyle.

1072
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:50,910
I'm popping a Phoenix.

1073
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:51,530
This is scary.

1074
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:53,610
We're on the slow side.

1075
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,390
Go up the ramp.

1076
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:56,730
Go up the ramp.

1077
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:56,950
Okay.

1078
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:58,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1079
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:01,070
Okay, I'm fucking running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.

1080
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,770
I don't even have time to heal.

1081
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:05,310
Pop a medkit, pop a medkit, pop a medkit, pop a medkit, pop a medkit.

1082
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,250
Pop a medkit and we're gonna bot lane.

1083
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:08,690
Right here?

1084
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:09,650
Or up the slope?

1085
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,350
Keep going up, keep going up.

1086
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:12,010
Yeah, keep going up.

1087
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:15,130
Wait, I think we just...

1088
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:15,930
Tell me one.

1089
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:16,550
Ready?

1090
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:17,750
Ready?

1091
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:19,170
I think you have to leave me to die.

1092
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:19,830
You have to leave me to die.

1093
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:21,610
Just leave me to die.

1094
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:22,910
Just run, just run, just run.

1095
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:24,150
Leave me to die.

1096
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:26,530
I believe.

1097
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:28,750
I'm flying.

1098
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:29,970
Can I make this?

1099
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:31,630
I made it.

1100
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:33,670
You guys got this?

1101
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:34,290
I made it too.

1102
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:37,830
How's your 14 squad still?

1103
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,370
Wait, how am I alive?

1104
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:42,610
Are you good?

1105
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:42,950
You good?

1106
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,030
Come to me, come to me.

1107
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:44,870
I hope I am.

1108
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:45,530
I hope I am.

1109
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:48,910
There's still 13 squads?

1110
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:49,870
Are you kidding me?

1111
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:50,510
No!

1112
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:52,390
No.

1113
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:53,450
Are they flicking me?

1114
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:54,130
No, no, no.

1115
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:54,650
No, no, no, no.

1116
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:56,950
They're like way in the back.

1117
00:37:57,490 --> 00:37:58,950
I think I can go to you actually.

1118
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:00,170
Are they fighting?

1119
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:00,550
Are they fighting?

1120
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:01,330
No, no, no, no.

1121
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:02,650
They're just like in the fucking Narnia.

1122
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,130
In the fucking Narnia.

1123
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:06,650
They just...

1124
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:08,630
No way!

1125
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,010
No way!

1126
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:12,330
They're random sniper men!

1127
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:14,270
Top 10!

1128
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:15,710
Go on, just lift the top 10!

1129
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:19,250
I'm never fucking forgiving this guy.

1130
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:25,770
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1131
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:26,190
Bro!

1132
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:27,930
My bad.

1133
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,730
I believe in you.

1134
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:34,210
Top 10.

1135
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:37,470
Oh, okay.

1136
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,290
I believe in you a little less now.

1137
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:42,890
Wait, he has av meds!

1138
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:43,450
Yeah, yeah.

1139
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:44,610
Yeah, Tayo has av meds.

1140
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:47,790
Two med kits, I think.

1141
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:48,290
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1142
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:50,550
Oh my god.

1143
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:51,150
Oh my god.

1144
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:51,710
Get the juice.

1145
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,670
There's no way.

1146
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:56,690
Who the fuck's this guy?

1147
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:57,970
Oh, that's not a guy.

1148
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:58,930
That's a team.

1149
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:00,370
That's his teammate!

1150
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:04,270
11-11!

1151
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:05,630
We're almost top 10.

1152
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:08,790
Okay, top 10.

1153
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:09,650
We need those points.

1154
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:11,070
We have kill points too!

1155
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:11,230
Oh shit.

1156
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:11,770
Plus bandages.

1157
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:13,130
Oh, oh, oh.

1158
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:15,310
He won't shoot you.

1159
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:16,410
Yeah, he won't shoot you.

1160
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:17,190
He's too scared.

1161
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,510
There's no way he tries to shoot you.

1162
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,030
You're so...

1163
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:24,430
Oh my god.

1164
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:25,290
No!

1165
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,610
We're so close to top 10!

1166
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:30,170
No!

1167
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:31,990
We're really, really close.

1168
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,530
Oh my god.

1169
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:33,950
So close, man.

1170
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:36,210
Why did the team push us?

1171
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:37,270
They have a free rotate.

1172
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,690
They needed the kill points.

1173
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:43,390
At least we got three kill points, right?

1174
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1175
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:45,110
You know what?

1176
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:45,990
We got three kill points.

1177
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:47,230
That secure us not last.

1178
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:48,350
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1179
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:50,070
That should secure us not last.

1180
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:50,670
Exactly.

1181
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:54,450
Unless we get last place the next five games.

1182
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:55,090
But that's...

1183
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:57,370
That'll never happen.

1184
00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:58,490
That'll never happen.

1185
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:00,430
At least we're not last here.

1186
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:03,670
Bro, that team that got Harvester...

1187
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:04,870
Fucking so free.

1188
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:06,750
Oh yeah, true.

1189
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:08,590
Oh my god.

1190
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:10,470
What's going on?

1191
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:14,010
I can't believe we got pushed there.

1192
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:17,210
I can't believe we got pushed there.

1193
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:20,010
Yeah, I was like, Scan, I was like, wait a minute.

1194
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:21,050
I thought they were just gonna kill.

1195
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:22,530
I was like, alright.

1196
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:24,790
They know we have Balth, you know?

1197
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:25,850
We're gonna like...

1198
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:27,990
Yeah, they were gonna be like, is that free rotate?

1199
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,350
Nothing's for free.

1200
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:32,070
Push, push.

1201
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:33,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1202
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:35,510
Oh.

1203
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:37,910
We have to earn the rotation.

1204
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:43,850
That would have to be like the fucking scariest rotate.

1205
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:48,750
I still count back.

1206
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:50,890
I still believe there was still like 14 squads.

1207
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:52,330
When I died.

1208
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:54,730
Nah, yeah, that was crazy.

1209
00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:55,810
That was so scary.

1210
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:59,210
This dude's just rising in the middle of the fucking war zone.

1211
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:02,170
Yeah, waiting to climb up.

1212
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:06,630
Oh my god, whoever's inside is so lucky.

1213
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:08,570
Which team is this?

1214
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:09,090
Yeah, it is.

1215
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:13,830
What team am I spectating?

1216
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:18,290
I'm expecting a Bang, Caustic, Bloodhound team.

1217
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:19,930
Yeah, they're on top, right?

1218
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:20,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1219
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:23,950
I'm not gonna lie though, that fight was a good fight.

1220
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:25,270
It was, yeah.

1221
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:27,030
I literally did zero damage.

1222
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:28,990
I walked in behind them.

1223
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:30,330
I thought I could get a flank.

1224
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:32,410
And there was just three people just looking at me.

1225
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:35,370
I was like, oh, this is good knowing you guys.

1226
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:39,590
I was gonna say, I cracked three people.

1227
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:41,930
And I was like, I was like so scared.

1228
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:42,770
I was like, wait.

1229
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:47,590
You said you cracked them, so I was like, there's no way they're gonna be looking at me.

1230
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:49,110
There's no way they'll see you, you know?

1231
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:49,950
There's no way.

1232
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:52,170
They were just all looking at me.

1233
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:55,230
It's okay, that's why we have your ease here.

1234
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:57,430
I had my Mozambique out and everything.

1235
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:58,570
Oh, the Mozambique.

1236
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:00,350
Wait, you didn't get to shoot your Mozambique?

1237
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:02,110
No, I shot it once and...

1238
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:02,590
No.

1239
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:05,630
Bro, you have 60!

1240
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:08,430
I'm sad.

1241
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:11,030
This team is definitely winning, right?

1242
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:12,550
Yeah, yeah, high ground.

1243
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:15,190
I mean, I don't know, cause high ground is not in the...

1244
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:16,270
It's not in the...

1245
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:17,970
The ringside.

1246
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:19,770
So they can shoot them down.

1247
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:22,890
I... you know...

1248
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:25,710
If you didn't say that, I would not have known.

1249
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,370
And I would not have seen your damage.

1250
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:28,790
Is that GP?

1251
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:29,710
Yeah, I did like 10.

1252
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:31,930
How much damage did I do?

1253
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:32,950
You did 60.

1254
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:36,810
That's like from the start, where I was like peppering them.

1255
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:40,650
What is 60 damage, bro?

1256
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:41,570
What happened?

1257
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:43,530
Bro...

1258
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:48,530
I'm warming up, and my fucking rookie 30 damage.

1259
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:51,390
Why isn't it fucking applying here?

1260
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:52,250
I don't understand.

1261
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:54,770
I don't understand why it's...

1262
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:56,670
That's a sick ass fucking bloodhound scan.

1263
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:58,610
Yeah bro, that's sick.

1264
00:42:58,830 --> 00:42:59,730
That skin's sick.

1265
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:03,190
Oh my god, it's okay.

1266
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:05,150
We're the content creators.

1267
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:06,410
Guess who won, guys.

1268
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:08,850
Is it Celia's team?

1269
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:12,510
Or is it Celia's team?

1270
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:14,930
At least you can't see the damage.

1271
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:16,350
Oh yeah, it's...

1272
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:17,250
Wait, what's that?

1273
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:18,370
Tiki.

1274
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:21,070
Tiki's so scary.

1275
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:25,310
Yeah, he's playing with Pinotak.

1276
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:30,460
Three kills, not bad.

1277
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:31,920
We got three kills.

1278
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:32,620
Yeah, not last.

1279
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:33,860
Yeah, exactly.

1280
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,600
That's all we wanted.

1281
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:43,380
Just by looking at the leaderboard, I'm thinking we're like a little 16th, 13th, 14th type shit.

1282
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,120
Nah, I'm going top 10, bro.

1283
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,380
I'm going top 10.

1284
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,140
Not last.

1285
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:50,160
Not last.

1286
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,660
It's all I want.

1287
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,340
As long as I'm not last.

1288
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,980
Because if you're not first...

1289
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:02,380
If you're not first, placements don't matter.

1290
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,380
Except for last.

1291
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,880
Except for last.

1292
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:11,760
The only positions that matter is first, last, and everything in between is the same.

1293
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,280
Yeah, everything in between is just you participated.

1294
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:14,540
You were there.

1295
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:15,640
That's true.

1296
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,640
That's true.

1297
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:21,480
Everybody remembers the 5th place team or the 6th place or the 3rd place team.

1298
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:21,640
Yeah, I know.

1299
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:22,000
I know.

1300
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,620
Everybody remembers the first and the last.

1301
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,040
I'm just picking up a fucking repeater.

1302
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,900
I can't use anything else.

1303
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,140
Just don't pick up the Mozamm.

1304
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:35,700
Mozamm's cursed.

1305
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:37,720
We know now.

1306
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,040
I'm just so sad.

1307
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:43,040
I could have picked up a Mastiff, but I'm like, no.

1308
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,980
This Mozamm is my life.

1309
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:46,940
You're just like, you know what?

1310
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,500
Mozamm's the way to go.

1311
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,240
And you're like, you know what?

1312
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:49,820
You're right.

1313
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,100
Listen, listen, listen.

1314
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:52,060
Guess what?

1315
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:52,580
Guess what?

1316
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:53,760
It was the IGL's fault.

1317
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:54,500
Oh yeah!

1318
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:55,400
It was!

1319
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,940
Yuris, you told me to get the fucking Mozamm.

1320
00:44:58,940 --> 00:44:59,400
Exactly.

1321
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:00,280
That's not my bad.

1322
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,060
That was you.

1323
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:03,560
You told him.

1324
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,000
He had a chance to actually do damage.

1325
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:09,040
I'm sad.

1326
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:14,080
Alright, now all you have to do is do the opposite of what Yuris tells you to do.

1327
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:15,360
That's true.

1328
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,800
And then you'll have more damage.

1329
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:20,940
Alright, where are we landing on Stormpoint?

1330
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:21,640
Are we playing the same comp?

1331
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:25,460
Uh, same comp, yeah.

1332
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:27,300
Um, actually, yeah, yeah.

1333
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:28,400
I like our bot, bro.

1334
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:33,240
If we just didn't get, you know, cocked by the fucking people running at us.

1335
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:37,300
You got cocked by Lee.

1336
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,340
Who were they?

1337
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,420
It was Team Satsuki.

1338
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,220
Team 15.

1339
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:44,400
Who was Team 15?

1340
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:45,340
Team 15.

1341
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,840
It was Tappy.

1342
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:48,280
It was fucking Tappy!

1343
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:49,300
Team 14.

1344
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:49,820
Team 14.

1345
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:50,780
Oh, okay, Team 14.

1346
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:51,620
Okay, I was gonna say.

1347
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:54,420
Yeah, they have Hisshiko.

1348
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,180
That's understandable.

1349
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:58,380
Understandable.

1350
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:02,400
They have Satsuki.

1351
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,580
That's understandable.

1352
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:04,680
Oh!

1353
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:06,980
What's that supposed to be?

1354
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,300
He's the controller brain, bro.

1355
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:12,800
Satsuki.

1356
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,080
Oh, he's just running down, guys?

1357
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,100
Just running down at the aim assist.

1358
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:17,700
It's alright.

1359
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:19,800
It'll lock in for us.

1360
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:25,460
They're like, that team, they saw us shoot them and they're like, that team's mouse and keyboard.

1361
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:26,120
We got this.

1362
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:28,980
Look at that guy with the mosem beam.

1363
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:29,900
Look at that guy.

1364
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:31,420
60 damage.

1365
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:32,180
Look at that.

1366
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,760
They saw the mosem beam and pushed him.

1367
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:39,040
They saw the mosem.

1368
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:42,400
Look at this dude.

1369
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:43,640
He has the mosem.

1370
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:44,040
Oh.

1371
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,260
He just ran at them.

1372
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:47,400
I mean, it worked.

1373
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,100
They killed me.

1374
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:49,740
They killed me.

1375
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,840
Yeah, they took you down so fucking fast.

1376
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:53,500
Dude, that was so...

1377
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:58,700
Bro, they ignored me and killed you first even though I was right in front of them.

1378
00:46:58,760 --> 00:46:59,500
That was actually crazy.

1379
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:02,220
No, they knew the mosem was the threat.

1380
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:04,940
They knew the mosem was going to threaten them.

1381
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:06,240
Yeah, exactly.

1382
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:09,080
They knew it had a hammer point on it.

1383
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:10,120
They were like, oh no.

1384
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:11,300
Gotta take him down.

1385
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:13,000
It's okay.

1386
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:13,660
They're like, oh no.

1387
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:14,540
He's M and K.

1388
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:15,340
We got this.

1389
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:17,740
Alright.

1390
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,540
I just need him.

1391
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:21,920
Where are we landing?

1392
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:23,560
Oh yeah.

1393
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,620
We need to look at where we're landing.

1394
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,060
Left of lightning rod.

1395
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:29,320
They call that place.

1396
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,600
Zoo station.

1397
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:32,880
Zoo station?

1398
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:33,780
Who's around us?

1399
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,180
Oh my god, where is it?

1400
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:37,660
Vodka steam.

1401
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,340
Oh yeah, nice.

1402
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:41,020
We can kill them.

1403
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:44,980
Is that our girl?

1404
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:45,820
Is that our girl?

1405
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:46,740
Final words.

1406
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:47,720
We can kill them.

1407
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:48,460
20 plays.

1408
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:52,340
Let's see.

1409
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,500
Where the fuck is the...

1410
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:55,640
Where is the map?

1411
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:57,040
I just see storm...

1412
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:57,760
Oh, there's storm point.

1413
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,040
Wait, they're not near us.

1414
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,400
I don't even see 18.

1415
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:04,020
16, 13, 15.

1416
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:07,640
We have 16, 13, and 15 left.

1417
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:08,240
They're just walking around us.

1418
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,540
We have Tappy.

1419
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,980
We have Saku.

1420
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:14,800
And we have...

1421
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:18,040
I always don't know how to pronounce 16.

1422
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,280
How do you pronounce 16's name?

1423
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:20,740
F-chan.

1424
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:21,800
F-chan?

1425
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,600
Like C-H-A-N.

1426
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:26,240
Ah.

1427
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:28,300
We're in.

1428
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:29,520
Guys, we're top 10!

1429
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:32,180
We're top 10?

1430
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:33,460
We're in!

1431
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:34,700
The three kills.

1432
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:37,460
Our three kills put us up there.

1433
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:37,980
Wait.

1434
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,420
Wait, where are you getting this info?

1435
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,280
Someone in my chat.

1436
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:43,680
Oh, okay.

1437
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,140
The source is chat.

1438
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,180
Oh shit, wait.

1439
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:48,320
I'm not sure about that.

1440
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:49,520
How reliable is your chat?

1441
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,340
My chat doesn't troll me when it comes to placements.

1442
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:52,880
Don't worry.

1443
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:55,620
Don't troll me.

1444
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,520
Alright, we're top 10.

1445
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:58,060
Let's go.

1446
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,220
We can do this, I believe.

1447
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:05,840
My goal of this next game is to get more than 60 damage.

1448
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:06,480
Oh, yeah.

1449
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:08,260
That would be fun, right?

1450
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:11,120
Aim low, you know?

1451
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:12,500
So you'll always be surprised.

1452
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,320
You'll always be surprised.

1453
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:20,220
I can't wait for the solos and we can watch your ease.

1454
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:22,280
Yeah, we're just shit-talking.

1455
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:23,000
Yeah, we...

1456
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Okay, guys, let's not...

1457
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:28,900
It's gonna be like, comms, comms, and then we're just having a conversation.

1458
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,960
Yo, me and Doki's duos is gonna go to shit.

1459
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:34,620
Oh, we're so fucked.

1460
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:35,400
I'm sorry.

1461
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:38,300
I'm sorry.

1462
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:39,900
It's my fault.

1463
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,540
I believe in you guys.

1464
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,080
Can you like, watch us?

1465
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,700
You can spectate us, right?

1466
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,300
Or like, we have to screen share for you.

1467
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:53,260
Cause I assume like, Uri's can't fucking spectate or he'll like, ghost for us.

1468
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,320
I would never do that.

1469
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,560
I would never do that.

1470
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,460
Cause like, it's supposed to be like, your pro player is supposed to coach you.

1471
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,100
Can we land here?

1472
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:06,520
Or nah?

1473
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:10,780
Yeah, you just hear me like, whispering like, Yo, there's a team in front of you.

1474
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:11,740
Yo, yo, there's a team in front of you.

1475
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:13,920
The end zone is like, over there.

1476
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:16,440
I can see everything.

1477
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:19,680
Godspot's open.

1478
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,260
Yeah, godspot, nobody's there.

1479
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,140
Nobody's there.

1480
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:31,180
Yeah, cause I was like, cause it says like, your coach is supposed to coach, like your pro player is supposed to coach you.

1481
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:31,660
And I'm like, how?

1482
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:33,220
Did we screen share?

1483
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:34,160
Oh, really?

1484
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:35,320
Oh fuck.

1485
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:37,740
I'm about to have like, 10 tabs here, bro.

1486
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:38,260
Yeah.

1487
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:41,780
Just, you know, just don't...

1488
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,760
Trust me when I say land there.

1489
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:48,040
You probably can't know, but I know.

1490
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:50,900
He's like, hey, you know that area over there?

1491
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:52,720
You should totally land there.

1492
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:53,580
You know, there's...

1493
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:56,100
My gut's telling me that fucking building is open.

1494
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:58,680
Your gut is telling you.

1495
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:04,200
Yeah, my gut is like, my second monitor.

1496
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,800
I have a hemlock with a gold...

1497
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:14,680
or purple...

1498
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:16,180
What the heck?

1499
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:16,940
Oh my god.

1500
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:19,000
It's gonna give us this landing spot.

1501
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:20,200
It just has nothing.

1502
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:21,760
Anyone need this shit?

1503
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,680
Wait, there's so many Havocs.

1504
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:26,420
I have a...

1505
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,540
Yeah, I want the Havoc.

1506
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,120
I have a carbine...

1507
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:30,920
Carbine alternator?

1508
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,400
I need a fucking different second gun.

1509
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:34,400
Um...

1510
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,340
Okay.

1511
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:36,920
Yeah, I don't have a second gun.

1512
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:40,220
I haven't... I trapped an alternator, if anyone wants it.

1513
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:42,640
Oh, there's an R9.

1514
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:45,000
Isn't that dog?

1515
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:46,040
Yeah, but...

1516
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:46,960
Dude, there's a Mozambique.

1517
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:47,820
Yeah.

1518
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:52,460
Don't pick up the Mozambique!

1519
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:54,000
Or you're gonna get like 40 damage.

1520
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:56,200
I picked it up.

1521
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,500
I picked it up.

1522
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:58,320
Oh no.

1523
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,780
Definitely gonna get 40 damage now.

1524
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,160
Did anyone loot the backside yet?

1525
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:04,720
Uh...

1526
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:05,100
That side?

1527
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,560
No, not all the way down now.

1528
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:07,120
Oh, they did.

1529
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:09,560
Okay, we're not that far from zone.

1530
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:10,040
Thank god.

1531
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:11,880
Um... let's see.

1532
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:13,600
Yeah, I think we're gonna go for this can.

1533
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:16,080
Get that little... um...

1534
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:16,980
Harvester.

1535
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:18,680
Go back to Zeus.

1536
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,060
Get this little...

1537
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:22,740
We need purple so bad.

1538
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:24,040
We need purple so bad.

1539
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:25,200
Yeah...

1540
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,160
Wait, they actually... I think they had purple when we fought them.

1541
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:28,980
I don't remember.

1542
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:29,900
Yeah, they did.

1543
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,220
That team had purple.

1544
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:32,600
Yeah, they were gaming.

1545
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,560
I'm running... Carbine Prowler.

1546
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,000
I should be good.

1547
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:39,740
With my loot.

1548
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,160
Unlock Mozambique.

1549
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:42,600
You like the Prowler?

1550
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:44,320
Yeah, Prowler's great.

1551
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:45,160
Respect.

1552
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,380
What the heck?

1553
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:52,260
No, I respect that actually.

1554
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:54,880
That is fucking great, man.

1555
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,160
I just need to hit one shot...

1556
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,760
one beat burst and we're fine.

1557
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:00,020
That's like almost a crack.

1558
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:03,260
Alright.

1559
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:05,160
Oh, I'll scan that.

1560
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:07,460
I replay for this beacon scan and we're gonna go.

1561
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:08,780
They haven't looted it yet.

1562
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:13,260
If you see a better shotgun than a fucking Lozan...

1563
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:15,540
There you go.

1564
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:15,860
Oh!

1565
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:19,160
Got you bro, I got you.

1566
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,840
I'm never letting you be on the...

1567
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:22,240
Fucking Lozan.

1568
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:24,360
And before he does less damage.

1569
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:26,200
Zero.

1570
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:26,900
Zero.

1571
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,520
Where the fuck is the...

1572
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:29,540
Oh, there it is.

1573
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:30,460
I was like, where is this?

1574
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:30,860
I'm scanning.

1575
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:32,900
Yup.

1576
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,000
We're there.

1577
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:36,260
Recovering.

1578
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:37,700
Oh, that's a gold mask.

1579
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:38,620
Oh, everybody's heading here.

1580
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:41,200
I think that's the...

1581
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,460
Here or Cito?

1582
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:44,600
Is that a pylon or Cito?

1583
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:46,440
Yeah, it looks like a pylon.

1584
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:47,880
Looks like a pylon zone.

1585
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,220
Oh, we are gonna get purple, guys.

1586
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,100
Oh, I'm gonna grab the harvester.

1587
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:54,680
The Evo.

1588
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,060
Cause it's right next to me.

1589
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,080
We got some attachments here.

1590
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,380
Should be fine.

1591
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:04,780
Oh my god, everybody's there already.

1592
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:05,360
These guys...

1593
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:06,520
I don't see the doggies.

1594
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:11,740
I forgot like, uh, JP servers, everybody just rotates.

1595
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:13,040
We're gonna go up here after.

1596
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:13,920
Yeah.

1597
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,740
Actually we should go up now.

1598
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:18,300
It's kind of... zones can't kill me.

1599
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:20,200
I'm gonna take this cannon.

1600
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:21,460
Take the cannon here.

1601
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:22,320
Let's go up here.

1602
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:25,400
We're gonna play for this Evo harvester over there.

1603
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,080
And scan the beacon again.

1604
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:28,560
Look at this, guys.

1605
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:29,900
IGL.

1606
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,120
Such great IGL.

1607
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:34,940
Don't worry.

1608
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:36,380
Thank you, thank you.

1609
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:40,440
If we do like, NA IGL, they won't expect it.

1610
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:42,920
Cause they're so used to JP strats.

1611
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:44,860
Exactly.

1612
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:47,740
We're the NA strats here.

1613
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:48,640
What the fuck is this team?

1614
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:49,920
Oh, yeah.

1615
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,680
Oh, it's the NA team.

1616
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,040
It's the NA team.

1617
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,260
What's this team still doing outside of zone?

1618
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:56,560
English speaking team.

1619
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:58,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1620
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:03,720
Of course, the NA team is still out of zone.

1621
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:06,360
Always out of zone.

1622
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:07,040
Never in.

1623
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,560
There's zone healing.

1624
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:13,340
We're not getting routed here, right, Thio?

1625
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:16,540
That's not a thing that ever happens.

1626
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:17,920
Yeah, no way.

1627
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:19,520
Even though you guys have...

1628
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:20,380
Oh, we have blue armor!

1629
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:20,900
Nice!

1630
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:23,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1631
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:24,300
We're up, bro.

1632
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:25,820
We're up in the world.

1633
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:27,460
Are you doing the spiders?

1634
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:30,780
We should do spiders, right?

1635
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:32,480
We should do the spiders and then we're gonna rotate there as well.

1636
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:33,060
Alright.

1637
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:35,200
We're almost here.

1638
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:37,680
I'm just running around.

1639
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:38,500
I don't know this map.

1640
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:39,460
Or the building.

1641
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:41,840
Alright, I'll go scan.

1642
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,560
There's a nemesis here in front of me.

1643
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:45,700
If anybody wants that.

1644
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:48,860
I'm good.

1645
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:51,540
I'm Baptiste.

1646
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:51,980
Alright.

1647
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:56,640
Scanning?

1648
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:59,460
Oh yes, give me all the extensions.

1649
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:01,040
Oh, there is definitely.

1650
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:03,140
There's a...

1651
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:05,520
Digi here.

1652
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,580
There's a team there.

1653
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:09,560
I can't put it on my mask.

1654
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:10,900
I'm good.

1655
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:12,980
I'm good.

1656
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,180
Oh my god.

1657
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:15,780
There's like a team here.

1658
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:18,100
There's a full team here.

1659
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,640
It's definitely a pylon zone.

1660
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:22,080
Looking like a pylon zone, guys.

1661
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,100
Definitely does, yeah.

1662
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:27,500
Team's going for this.

1663
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:28,900
Rotating up.

1664
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,420
I think we should rotate towards...

1665
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:31,700
Stormcatcher.

1666
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:32,660
I need a bat.

1667
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:36,760
I don't even want...

1668
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:37,500
There's a...

1669
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:41,420
I have two bats now.

1670
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:42,060
I have four.

1671
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:43,120
I have two.

1672
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:48,560
I'm going to go slow.

1673
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:50,600
I'm going to go slow.

1674
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:50,900
I'm going to check the lid.

1675
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:52,940
Oh, another bat there.

1676
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:55,020
I'm going to go take it.

1677
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:55,760
Yeah, you can get it.

1678
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:55,940
Grab it.

1679
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:58,860
There you go.

1680
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:00,000
Let us go.

1681
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:02,680
Oh, dude.

1682
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:04,260
If I had my fucking...

1683
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:05,420
...Mozan, I would have got that.

1684
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:07,820
No.

1685
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,900
Resist the Mozans temptation.

1686
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:12,120
Resist it.

1687
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:12,840
I think...

1688
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,260
I need like a fucking...

1689
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:15,940
...Heavy Mag.

1690
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:18,620
A Prowler.

1691
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:19,700
For a Prowler.

1692
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:21,000
Ready?

1693
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:23,640
I'm ready, yeah.

1694
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:24,840
Heavy Mag or the Prowler?

1695
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:25,820
I need a Heavy Mag.

1696
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:29,560
Weeeeee.

1697
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:32,040
Alright, we take the zip...

1698
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,460
...towards Stormcatcher too.

1699
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:34,040
Okay.

1700
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:37,680
Did you hear like Punch Boosting is sort of back?

1701
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:38,740
Because of a bug?

1702
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:40,020
Oh, really?

1703
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:40,800
That's why I'm flying.

1704
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:42,580
I don't know if they like reverted, but like...

1705
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:44,540
...apparently Punch Boosting was back for a bit.

1706
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:46,680
Wait, I think it is.

1707
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:47,620
I think they used Reboot.

1708
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:52,140
It feels like it.

1709
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:53,800
Yeah, I fell a little faster there.

1710
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:56,280
It's Placebo.

1711
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:57,440
Yeah, it's Placebo.

1712
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:57,800
Yeah.

1713
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,060
Yeah, I think so.

1714
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:01,020
I think it is Placebo.

1715
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:03,080
Are we taking the jumpy?

1716
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:03,820
Wait, scan our right?

1717
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:04,960
Scanning.

1718
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:05,780
Okay.

1719
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:06,220
We're going to the right side real quick.

1720
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:07,320
Okay.

1721
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:10,460
We're playing for this Harvest.

1722
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,160
I heard someone.

1723
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:14,560
Maybe they're below us.

1724
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:17,180
Ohhhhh.

1725
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:18,920
Do we have a bird?

1726
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:19,900
A little birdie?

1727
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:21,180
Uh, nope.

1728
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:23,420
We're going to play for this beacon scan.

1729
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:24,800
On low ground.

1730
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,240
Oh yeah, there's a team right there.

1731
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:29,300
I don't see it.

1732
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:30,160
We should scan it right now.

1733
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,180
They zipped up on this height.

1734
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:34,280
Let's see.

1735
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:35,380
Do I do a tactical...

1736
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:37,640
...coldown or taste of blood?

1737
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,620
Gain 25 HP or...

1738
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:40,700
...reduce tactical cooldown?

1739
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:42,960
Tactical cooldown.

1740
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,300
I think no one's here.

1741
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:46,540
Scan the beacon.

1742
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:47,660
I'm going to take space here.

1743
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:47,980
Alright.

1744
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:51,260
Oh, punch boosting back, baby.

1745
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:52,040
It is?

1746
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:53,640
Oh, okay.

1747
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:57,220
Bro, I got so happy for no reason.

1748
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:00,700
It feels faster though.

1749
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:01,620
It does feel faster.

1750
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:01,940
Yeah.

1751
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:04,900
Okay.

1752
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:05,380
Scanning?

1753
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:07,520
No one should be in this compound.

1754
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:08,520
I think.

1755
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:11,620
I think they left.

1756
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,900
Yeah, there's here, here, here.

1757
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:16,220
No one's in pylon.

1758
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:17,460
Wait.

1759
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:18,320
Let's go.

1760
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,660
We're going to ult from this cannon right here.

1761
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,560
We're going to take this side of the building.

1762
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:24,760
Woah.

1763
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,500
That's so scary.

1764
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:28,780
Yeah, that is scary.

1765
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:30,420
That is so scary.

1766
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:30,820
I know.

1767
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:31,720
Trust me.

1768
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:32,840
It's okay.

1769
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:34,520
I trust IGL.

1770
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:36,440
And we're going to get in this thing.

1771
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:38,760
I trust you with my life.

1772
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:39,940
I'm sweating right now.

1773
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:40,800
I'm actually scared.

1774
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,560
It all comes down to this fucking Valko.

1775
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:43,760
We're here.

1776
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:44,100
We're here.

1777
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:45,620
Just ping, ping, okay?

1778
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:46,280
Ready?

1779
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:46,780
Let's go.

1780
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:47,160
Yeah, yeah.

1781
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:47,500
I will.

1782
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:47,760
I will.

1783
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:48,240
Yep.

1784
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,260
Just go over this hill for now.

1785
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:51,980
Alright, the first step.

1786
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:54,100
Tired to go over this hill.

1787
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:55,640
Wait.

1788
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:56,680
Did someone just take it?

1789
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:57,300
No, no.

1790
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:57,500
We're good.

1791
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:57,720
We're good.

1792
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:58,100
We're good.

1793
00:59:58,100 --> 00:59:58,660
Wait.

1794
00:59:58,720 --> 00:59:59,640
I think they're taking it.

1795
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:00,140
Ping, ping, ping.

1796
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:04,780
There's one in front of us.

1797
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:05,280
In front of us.

1798
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:05,540
Where?

1799
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:05,960
Where?

1800
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:06,960
On me.

1801
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:07,160
On me.

1802
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:07,300
On me.

1803
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:07,740
Land on me.

1804
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:08,060
Land on me.

1805
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:08,900
Yeah, I landed.

1806
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:09,280
I landed.

1807
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:09,560
I landed.

1808
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:11,820
Oh, Talos.

1809
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:12,060
Talos.

1810
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:12,480
Talos.

1811
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:14,960
Well, you pinged the wrong...

1812
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:15,660
Okay.

1813
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:16,500
I have gold.

1814
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:16,820
I have gold.

1815
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:17,080
I have gold.

1816
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:17,320
I have gold.

1817
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:17,640
I have gold.

1818
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:18,340
Nice.

1819
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:18,660
Nice.

1820
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:18,880
Nice.

1821
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:19,040
Nice.

1822
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:19,140
Nice.

1823
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,320
Get inside right away.

1824
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:21,660
I don't have a scan.

1825
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:22,200
I already used it.

1826
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:26,060
Oh, I'm so fucked.

1827
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:26,480
Payne, that side.

1828
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:27,280
Payne, that side for now.

1829
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:28,900
No.

1830
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:29,640
I can shield.

1831
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:30,000
I can shield.

1832
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:30,340
I can shield.

1833
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:33,080
Shielding.

1834
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:33,260
Shielding.

1835
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:35,660
Oh, yep.

1836
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:40,020
I don't know, man.

1837
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:41,040
That...

1838
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:43,140
I have my...

1839
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:44,080
Bad timing.

1840
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:46,080
Someone flew as soon as we flew.

1841
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:47,040
Yeah.

1842
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:49,260
It's okay.

1843
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:49,780
We're not last.

1844
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:54,180
You're east.

1845
01:00:54,220 --> 01:00:54,660
The rat.

1846
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:55,160
Let's go.

1847
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:58,200
Oh, nice.

1848
01:00:58,500 --> 01:00:58,860
Oh, nice.

1849
01:00:59,000 --> 01:00:59,360
Wait.

1850
01:00:59,400 --> 01:00:59,760
They're gonna know.

1851
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:01,140
Don't know.

1852
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:03,000
They'll never know.

1853
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:03,560
Wait.

1854
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:03,700
Wait.

1855
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:03,960
Wait.

1856
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:04,120
Wait.

1857
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:04,380
Up.

1858
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:06,280
Up.

1859
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:06,520
Up.

1860
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:06,720
Up.

1861
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:06,880
Up.

1862
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:06,980
Up.

1863
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:07,020
Up.

1864
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:07,120
Up.

1865
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:07,260
Up.

1866
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:07,320
Up.

1867
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:07,440
Up.

1868
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:11,220
Oh, my God.

1869
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:11,960
Oh, my God.

1870
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:14,300
I don't want to move.

1871
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:14,860
I'm scared.

1872
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:15,060
Wait.

1873
01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:15,440
You should die.

1874
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:17,320
I should die?

1875
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:18,260
Okay.

1876
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:18,980
Okay.

1877
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:19,520
Okay.

1878
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:20,140
Fine.

1879
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:20,640
Okay.

1880
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:20,980
Okay.

1881
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:21,340
Alright.

1882
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:21,780
I'm dead.

1883
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:27,180
Here's an armor swap, Yuris.

1884
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:27,760
There you go.

1885
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:32,440
Did you take my armor swap?

1886
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:38,380
He took mine.

1887
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:40,620
Don't worry, he has like two more.

1888
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:42,060
He has another armor swap.

1889
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:43,920
There you go.

1890
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,600
You should die.

1891
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:51,260
I already left.

1892
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:52,000
I'm sorry.

1893
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:53,460
Bro, leave us alone.

1894
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:56,320
You gotta worry about something else.

1895
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:57,320
Oh!

1896
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:00,340
Oh!

1897
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:01,280
Oh!

1898
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:04,500
The timing!

1899
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:05,340
The timing!

1900
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,020
They took the building.

1901
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:10,100
Yeah.

1902
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:11,500
At the same time?

1903
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:12,820
Yeah, they did.

1904
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:14,820
They landed as soon as we flew.

1905
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,180
Yeah, they got there before us.

1906
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:18,580
They landed as soon as we flew.

1907
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:19,900
One second before us.

1908
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:21,440
Bro.

1909
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:23,520
The fucking timing.

1910
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:28,300
They were going to the tree, but they stopped.

1911
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:29,200
They were going to the tree, but they stopped.

1912
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,320
They went back to the building instead.

1913
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:32,260
Yeah.

1914
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:33,820
They knew.

1915
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:37,100
They're like, this is some early, easy K.P.

1916
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:37,600
right there.

1917
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:42,600
We could've fucking fought them though, but you got shot from the height.

1918
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:43,220
Yeah.

1919
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:45,280
I just dived to someone else.

1920
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:48,320
You were just like, come here!

1921
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:48,540
Come here!

1922
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,820
I think that Taya is just like 3 meters away from us.

1923
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:57,700
I went to the ping and then I was like, oh wait, Yuris is not at the ping.

1924
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,400
Because they got there first.

1925
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:09,920
And then Yuris and I swerved because I was like, there's people there, maybe we shouldn't go there.

1926
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:14,380
Taya, you listen to the IGL too much.

1927
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:16,780
You have to think for yourself.

1928
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:23,480
You have to let your rat brain come in.

1929
01:03:24,470 --> 01:03:26,240
And think against the IGL sometimes.

1930
01:03:29,950 --> 01:03:31,600
Because Yuris left us to die.

1931
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:39,080
I couldn't get my plus 60 damage.

1932
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:43,220
No, I'm at zero.

1933
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:47,200
We all got zero.

1934
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:49,820
I just want like 100.

1935
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:53,140
That one was the IGL's fault.

1936
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,060
I don't know, there seems to be a pattern.

1937
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:04,280
I don't know, it seemed 100% so good.

1938
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:05,760
And then we're just like...

1939
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:06,860
Dead.

1940
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:11,200
We got perpies, we're ready to go.

1941
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:15,520
We looked so healthy and then two different teams shot at us.

1942
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:17,540
It didn't matter.

1943
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:20,220
We couldn't even fight, man.

1944
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:22,840
We got nade, we got stag-nated.

1945
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:25,460
I didn't see the single bullet.

1946
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:30,680
We at least thought it would have been an honorable death but we just died by everyone in the line.

1947
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:34,700
Yeah, everyone just wanted to kill us.

1948
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:36,560
Our booties were just too much.

1949
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:39,840
We just looked so juicy.

1950
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:41,820
That one KP.

1951
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:43,600
The one KP.

1952
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:45,840
The one KP.

1953
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:46,820
The one KP, like look at that.

1954
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:47,600
Easy KP.

1955
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:50,760
How are they not in zone yet?

1956
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:54,760
Who are you guys watching?

1957
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,000
I'm watching... I have no idea.

1958
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:58,420
I'm watching a Valk, Bloodhound, Bing.

1959
01:04:59,020 --> 01:04:59,940
Yeah, me too.

1960
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:01,940
Who is it?

1961
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:03,220
LinshanSkye.

1962
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:07,020
Oh, we're watching the same thing.

1963
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:08,700
L-Y-K-E.

1964
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:09,620
Like?

1965
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:13,960
Yeah, how do you pronounce the phonetic?

1966
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:14,000
Yeah, yeah.

1967
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:14,560
Like.

1968
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:15,080
Like.

1969
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:15,100
Like.

1970
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:16,140
Like?

1971
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:17,040
Like that?

1972
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:17,300
Yeah.

1973
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:19,160
That's who we're watching.

1974
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:19,880
Like that, I guess.

1975
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:25,420
Okay, if they win, if this team wins, then we die to the best team in the lobby.

1976
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:26,360
Exactly.

1977
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:27,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1978
01:05:27,740 --> 01:05:29,100
So technically we're first too.

1979
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,420
Because we're watching them win.

1980
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:32,700
Yeah, yeah.

1981
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:34,380
We... we...

1982
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:36,120
Oh my god, they're pushing?

1983
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:38,740
Oh, they have to because they're in zone, yeah.

1984
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:40,720
Okay, please don't die.

1985
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,020
Oh, this guy is so dead.

1986
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:43,900
Yeah, this guy is dead.

1987
01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:44,840
He traded though.

1988
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:46,760
Oh, no!

1989
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:49,480
Holy sh...

1990
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,400
Okay, if we watch this play fighting...

1991
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:53,460
Oh, Yukio is dead for sure too.

1992
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:54,220
Oh, Yukio.

1993
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:55,900
Oh, he's dead.

1994
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:56,620
Oh, yeah, he is.

1995
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:57,760
Oh, he's so dead.

1996
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:58,700
Bro, what is this zone?

1997
01:05:59,120 --> 01:05:59,700
What the f...

1998
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:00,480
Okay, at least it's not...

1999
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:01,080
Oh, he's so dead.

2000
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:06,760
Anytime there's a pylon zone, it's so scary because there's only cover in pylon.

2001
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:09,200
Or is this Bangalore?

2002
01:06:10,180 --> 01:06:12,000
Or you guys wanted a solo Bangalore?

2003
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:12,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2004
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:14,520
The solo Bangalore with Kraber?

2005
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:15,820
Yeah, the solo Bangalore with Kraber?

2006
01:06:15,820 --> 01:06:16,460
Yeah, the solo Bangalore.

2007
01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:16,800
This is just...

2008
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:17,660
This is just one of them KP, bro.

2009
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:18,460
Oh, my God.

2010
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:19,540
There's a Watson team.

2011
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,920
Is Watson meta or are they just fucking big brain?

2012
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:24,540
They knew the zone was gonna be in buildings.

2013
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:28,740
Yuris, this could have been you, man.

2014
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:29,580
This could have been you.

2015
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:30,980
This could have been us.

2016
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:33,140
And we should have ratted here, all of us.

2017
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:34,520
Yeah, just in this corner.

2018
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:34,860
All of us.

2019
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:36,200
We don't shoot our guns.

2020
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:37,180
Yeah, just in this corner.

2021
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:41,440
We just kill this Bangalore and just sit behind this crate.

2022
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:45,760
Oh, my God.

2023
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:46,320
Oh, my God.

2024
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:46,920
Oh, my God.

2025
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:47,640
Oh, my God.

2026
01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:49,120
This could have been us.

2027
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:50,500
How did I drop there?

2028
01:06:50,580 --> 01:06:53,800
So after this, are we playing duo, trio?

2029
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:54,060
Is it?

2030
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:54,860
I just solo first.

2031
01:06:55,460 --> 01:06:56,300
I think it's...

2032
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:57,680
Okay, let me check.

2033
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:00,980
It's solo, and then me and Doki's idiotic adventure.

2034
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:03,880
Wait, it's six games though, right?

2035
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:04,980
Oh, hey, Will!

2036
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:09,620
Will said our translator for... well, my translator because you can't read.

2037
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:16,580
He said that it's gonna be watch for the solo duos.

2038
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,240
Someone's gonna do a watch party.

2039
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,920
And then like on Discord or something.

2040
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:25,140
And then like we just watch what they're doing so we don't ghost.

2041
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:27,680
Wait, can we talk?

2042
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:29,760
I mean, I'm pretty sure, yeah.

2043
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:33,520
We could just sing so Yuris gets distracted.

2044
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:35,460
We'll IG for Yuris!

2045
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:37,100
Oh yeah, that's cool.

2046
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:38,880
Yeah, give me some ideas.

2047
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:39,600
Yeah, I'm gonna do that.

2048
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:41,180
Yeah, we'll give you some...

2049
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:45,600
Bro, I almost leaked something for the next Apex update.

2050
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:52,440
I caught myself there.

2051
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:58,720
Oh dude.

2052
01:07:59,060 --> 01:08:00,560
Oh my god, that could be us.

2053
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:02,800
This dude's a rad professional.

2054
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,320
That could be us.

2055
01:08:07,540 --> 01:08:08,800
Who is this guy?

2056
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:10,260
Yeah, who is this guy?

2057
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:19,220
I would just mad the fuck up and go around that pillar.

2058
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:20,980
Yeah, let's see that pillar.

2059
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:21,920
That could be us!

2060
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:24,620
Oh my god, that really could be us.

2061
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:27,020
You scaredy-pulled out his gun.

2062
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:30,000
That could have been us.

2063
01:08:33,220 --> 01:08:35,460
This is literally just never gonna peak.

2064
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,540
It's actually only seven parties.

2065
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:41,920
I bet you this rat is gonna get top five.

2066
01:08:43,260 --> 01:08:44,000
Right here.

2067
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:45,440
I think it is.

2068
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:46,760
The teams are fighting right now.

2069
01:08:46,980 --> 01:08:47,900
Oh, can everybody get scanned?

2070
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:52,460
If it's not the team in front, then it should be okay, no?

2071
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:56,820
No, it's the team in front.

2072
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:58,520
It's okay.

2073
01:08:58,580 --> 01:08:59,680
They see this one rat.

2074
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:00,780
They're just gonna let him live.

2075
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:02,000
They need him.

2076
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:07,740
They need him to live so this guy can help them damage another team.

2077
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:09,780
That's six.

2078
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:12,400
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

2079
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,260
360, no scope?

2080
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:14,980
He should climb.

2081
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:16,000
He should climb right.

2082
01:09:16,780 --> 01:09:17,260
Whoa!

2083
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:17,980
He tried.

2084
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:18,600
He tried.

2085
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:19,080
He tried.

2086
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:20,580
Hi there.

2087
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:20,820
Hi.

2088
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:21,220
Yeah.

2089
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:23,040
Oh shit, he should not climb right.

2090
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:25,100
There's so many people.

2091
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:26,240
He's almost top five!

2092
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:29,140
Oh, he's riding.

2093
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:30,020
Holy shit.

2094
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:31,500
Bro, this guy is so smart.

2095
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:34,860
And there's no one on top of him, so...

2096
01:09:34,860 --> 01:09:35,180
Yeah.

2097
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:37,400
Oh!

2098
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:37,680
Oh!

2099
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:39,060
Oh, what the fuck?

2100
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:41,240
No, there's someone on top of him.

2101
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:42,360
No!

2102
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:47,380
Oh my god, look at the fucking Hanzo.

2103
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:47,980
Holy shit.

2104
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:51,460
This Watson team just wins for real.

2105
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:52,300
Who is it?

2106
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:55,840
They like hard, they hard grief for that one rat.

2107
01:09:55,860 --> 01:09:56,520
They literally all died.

2108
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:57,220
It's Cheeki again, bro.

2109
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:58,640
It's Cheeki.

2110
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:00,740
But Cheeki just knows.

2111
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:01,460
I can't lose.

2112
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:06,000
This man plays so many ranks, like his brain is on another level.

2113
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:07,280
Oh, he's so smart.

2114
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:09,880
He's been trained.

2115
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:11,460
Oh my god.

2116
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:14,580
One few rank grinders.

2117
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:16,200
Holy shit.

2118
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:19,440
Oh my god.

2119
01:10:19,580 --> 01:10:20,100
Oh my god.

2120
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:20,560
Oh my god.

2121
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:21,280
I'm watching him.

2122
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:24,360
He's so smart.

2123
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:27,060
I was...

2124
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:28,140
Oh my god.

2125
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:29,600
I think Cheeki's got this.

2126
01:10:29,620 --> 01:10:31,360
There's no fucking way they lose this.

2127
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:32,380
Oh my god.

2128
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:33,300
Holy shit.

2129
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,020
What the fuck?

2130
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:36,960
This dude check his computer.

2131
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:38,340
Like, what the fuck?

2132
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:38,820
Oh my god.

2133
01:10:38,820 --> 01:10:40,760
Check his PC.

2134
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:43,020
Check his PC, bro.

2135
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:44,220
That is not natural.

2136
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:46,120
Wait, was... did he back to back first place?

2137
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:49,140
Back to back max kill points.

2138
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:51,140
Max kill points.

2139
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:53,120
Oh my god, bro.

2140
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:55,040
This dude is not playing.

2141
01:10:56,060 --> 01:10:56,700
He's not.

2142
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:58,500
He is... he's Apex.

2143
01:10:58,500 --> 01:10:59,980
Get on and he got off of Violent.

2144
01:11:02,220 --> 01:11:04,020
Just give him the prize.

2145
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:05,540
Just give him the prize money already.

2146
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:06,360
Just do it.

2147
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:08,780
He's...

2148
01:11:08,780 --> 01:11:08,800
He's Apex.

2149
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:09,580
He's literally Apex.

2150
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:10,060
He's literally Apex.

2151
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:11,440
He should play for a fucking second place.

2152
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:11,820
Yeah, yeah.

2153
01:11:11,860 --> 01:11:12,240
We're all...

2154
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:13,840
We all just play for second and third.

2155
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:16,360
Holy...

2156
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:16,940
18.

2157
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:18,880
He had 18 kills.

2158
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:20,700
Oh my god.

2159
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:23,940
And then there's us over there.

2160
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:26,040
Where are we?

2161
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:26,360
We're...

2162
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:27,520
Hey, we're still...

2163
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:28,140
We're never last.

2164
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:29,320
You know.

2165
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:29,840
We're never last.

2166
01:11:29,860 --> 01:11:31,040
We're not last though.

2167
01:11:31,180 --> 01:11:32,040
We're not last.

2168
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:33,920
Our neighbors are last.

2169
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:35,500
Oh yeah, nice.

2170
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:36,020
Guess what?

2171
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:36,740
Guess who's last.

2172
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:37,600
Yeah, yeah.

2173
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:37,900
Our neighbors are last.

2174
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:38,540
We won against Selly.

2175
01:11:38,540 --> 01:11:38,700
We won against Selly.

2176
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:38,780
We won against Selly.

2177
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:39,980
More than Selly.

2178
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:40,700
We got...

2179
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:41,320
Look!

2180
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:42,540
We won against Selly!

2181
01:11:42,620 --> 01:11:43,060
We're better than Selly.

2182
01:11:43,550 --> 01:11:43,840
You're third.

2183
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:45,800
We did better than Selly in the UK.

2184
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:46,920
You're better than Selly, Tayo.

2185
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:49,780
That's already a win.

2186
01:11:49,940 --> 01:11:51,180
Our Selly is better.

2187
01:11:53,060 --> 01:11:54,640
Zero damage, Selly.

2188
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,640
Zero damage, Selly.

2189
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:00,720
My average for two games is 30 damage.

2190
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:04,840
I put up.

2191
01:12:04,940 --> 01:12:05,240
I put up.

2192
01:12:05,620 --> 01:12:06,380
You're right.

2193
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,220
You're averaging it up.

2194
01:12:08,220 --> 01:12:08,780
I'm not.

2195
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:09,660
30 damage.

2196
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:10,700
We can have that.

2197
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,280
Can I have that stat?

2198
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:14,280
Your 30 damage.

2199
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:15,320
After...

2200
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:18,620
After one month of Overwatch...

2201
01:12:18,620 --> 01:12:21,000
After one month of Overwatch remember back.

2202
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:22,020
Alright, alright.

2203
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:24,000
It's like, this is your brain on Overwatch.

2204
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:32,140
My brain just can't comprehend zones.

2205
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:33,120
Like, what is this?

2206
01:12:33,220 --> 01:12:33,860
I don't understand.

2207
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:36,820
Like, what are you doing?

2208
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:38,040
Where is the Winston bubble?

2209
01:12:38,180 --> 01:12:38,780
Like, I need...

2210
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,080
Dude, I need some healing.

2211
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:40,580
Where's the support?

2212
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:41,540
Where's our heals?

2213
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:42,860
Where's our Mercy player?

2214
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:45,440
I need the pocket, you know?

2215
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:46,400
The pocket.

2216
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:47,640
Mercy pocket.

2217
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:50,380
I just can't.

2218
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:51,920
I know, you're the Mercy now.

2219
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:54,580
30 damage.

2220
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:58,100
Lowest damage, Gart, is the Mercy pocket.

2221
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:01,880
Dude, I have the lowest damage in this lobby, 100%.

2222
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:02,980
I'm sad.

2223
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:06,500
Last place, like a little bitch.

2224
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:08,180
I'm about to cry.

2225
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:09,500
It's okay.

2226
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:12,480
It's okay, there's no way we have duos after.

2227
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:15,780
There's no way.

2228
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:18,500
Wait, is it already the solo?

2229
01:13:18,820 --> 01:13:19,900
Yeah, I think so.

2230
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:21,020
Yeah, because everybody's leaving.

2231
01:13:21,580 --> 01:13:22,980
Are they all kicking us out?

2232
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:23,960
Oh yeah, they're closing.

2233
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:24,660
Yeah.

2234
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:26,920
Okay, Yuris has to screen share.

2235
01:13:26,980 --> 01:13:27,040
Okay, I'm ready to watch.

2236
01:13:29,020 --> 01:13:30,280
That's the screen share for us.

2237
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:31,280
Oh, they have the code.

2238
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:32,540
Oh yeah, we can join.

2239
01:13:32,540 --> 01:13:33,400
Yeah, we can join.

2240
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:34,440
Yeah.

2241
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:36,380
Wait, I feel like...

2242
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:40,140
Okay, but like, what if like, we just watch Yuris?

2243
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:41,700
Like, how do we show that on stream?

2244
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:42,680
Like...

2245
01:13:45,620 --> 01:13:48,020
How do I show that on stream?

2246
01:13:48,020 --> 01:13:48,360
That's difficult.

2247
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:53,000
Guys, you're just gonna hear us commentate over a blank screen.

2248
01:13:54,420 --> 01:13:58,180
Yes guys, we're gonna be commentating on the black screen.

2249
01:13:58,520 --> 01:13:58,860
Yeah.

2250
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:05,020
I'm just like, how do I show this?

2251
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:05,860
Wait.

2252
01:14:05,860 --> 01:14:06,200
How is that?

2253
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:10,980
Wait, who's on our- the duo's?

2254
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:14,160
Who's on duo- uh...

2255
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:15,020
Selly?

2256
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:16,660
Yeah, that's what I'm saying!

2257
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:19,060
Selly's part of the duo's.

2258
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:20,000
How is that?

2259
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:21,840
But I have my own Selly right here.

2260
01:14:22,740 --> 01:14:25,520
Yes sir, yes sir, I'm ready.

2261
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:27,120
Yeah, my serial damage Selly.

2262
01:14:27,260 --> 01:14:27,620
Welcome back.

2263
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:30,320
Okay, Yuris- you have to screen share for us.

2264
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:32,720
Welcome back.

2265
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:34,980
Oh no, I have a 1PC setup.

2266
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:44,100
Wait, you guys have multiple PCs?

2267
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:45,100
What's going on?

2268
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:11,120
Okay guys, you won't be able to see what your use is doing on my screen.

2269
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:15,980
So you're just gonna trust my word on everything that's happening.

2270
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:21,400
Oh my god.

2271
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:26,340
How many people are... 20 teams, right?

2272
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:29,780
So I don't leak the code.

2273
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:35,820
Wait, you can have 30 teams of solos?

2274
01:15:35,820 --> 01:15:36,320
Holy shit.

2275
01:15:36,340 --> 01:15:36,760
Yeah.

2276
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:41,740
I think that's the same as... they're just using duos mode for solo.

2277
01:15:42,340 --> 01:15:43,720
They're just force starting it.

2278
01:15:45,460 --> 01:15:46,880
What map are you playing?

2279
01:15:49,580 --> 01:15:51,680
Limbo... oh shit, wait, where do I land?

2280
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:54,580
Everything is predetermined.

2281
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:56,100
Yeah.

2282
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:58,240
Oh, I'm landing fucking...

2283
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:00,280
Paysriver.

2284
01:16:00,740 --> 01:16:01,220
Nice.

2285
01:16:01,460 --> 01:16:02,460
Yeah, Paysriver's nice.

2286
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:04,000
Wait, what's your solo character?

2287
01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:08,280
I'm playing... Pathfinder.

2288
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:09,820
Playing what?

2289
01:16:12,260 --> 01:16:12,920
Pathfinder.

2290
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:15,000
A little Pathfinder fun.

2291
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:16,420
I believe.

2292
01:16:17,090 --> 01:16:18,180
A little Widowmaker.

2293
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:20,720
I believe.

2294
01:16:21,180 --> 01:16:23,320
Wait, didn't that new character came out?

2295
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:24,180
What's their name?

2296
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:26,740
Muh... something?

2297
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:28,680
The one that digs in Overwatch?

2298
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:30,320
Oh, Venture?

2299
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:33,120
Yeah, yeah, the Venture of Overwatch.

2300
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:35,500
Oh.

2301
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:36,880
Oh yeah, there's a Venture.

2302
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:38,480
Wait, no, no, no, it's not Venture.

2303
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:39,740
It's fucking Apex.

2304
01:16:39,980 --> 01:16:41,420
Yeah, I was gonna say... I mean...

2305
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:43,120
Wait, what?

2306
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:43,920
I'm stupid.

2307
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:44,880
Like, I have a...

2308
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:45,100
It's more something.

2309
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,160
I have a brain that's like the size of a peanut, bro.

2310
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:50,580
That's okay, you're an Overwatch player.

2311
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:57,000
Yeah, it's like... it doesn't... like, 1v1 doesn't... like, you need a small brain to be good at Overwatch.

2312
01:16:58,560 --> 01:16:59,360
That's true.

2313
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:01,040
You kinda have both.

2314
01:17:01,340 --> 01:17:03,500
Yeah, it was a no aim, no brain.

2315
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:04,540
You didn't need to turn on...

2316
01:17:04,540 --> 01:17:05,260
...the constant main.

2317
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:10,520
Yeah, just turn off half, like, of your receptors in your brain, and then you'll be good at Overwatch.

2318
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,860
Have you tried them out yet?

2319
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:18,500
Yeah, it was really fun.

2320
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:20,120
It was actually a good character.

2321
01:17:20,220 --> 01:17:23,160
Like, a dig... are they OP, or is it like...

2322
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:24,880
I mean, sure, I mean...

2323
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:28,720
Because, like, I know Overwatch characters on launch are always, like, overpowered as fuck.

2324
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:33,320
It's either they're overpowered as fuck, or they're like the most useless dog shit ever.

2325
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:34,440
Yeah.

2326
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:35,160
Like, no in between.

2327
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:36,420
That's true.

2328
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:37,220
That's true.

2329
01:17:40,060 --> 01:17:41,100
Wait, why is...

2330
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:42,140
Oh, yeah?

2331
01:17:42,420 --> 01:17:43,500
Wait, no, you go first.

2332
01:17:43,940 --> 01:17:47,140
No, I was wondering why VDK is here.

2333
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:48,540
VDK?

2334
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:51,420
Team18, he's like a streamer.

2335
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:53,640
Wait, is he the... is he the solo?

2336
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:54,460
Is he...

2337
01:17:54,460 --> 01:17:55,120
Yeah.

2338
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:56,440
This is it, Yuri!

2339
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:58,020
Find out where they land!

2340
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:04,000
Everyone's fucking roasting this guy, like, Team18, Lmao.

2341
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:04,380
Yeah.

2342
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:05,340
Team18, really?

2343
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:06,500
Team18?

2344
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:07,520
Yeah.

2345
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:09,140
Bro.

2346
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:10,420
Bro.

2347
01:18:11,140 --> 01:18:11,760
Bro.

2348
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:14,340
The people in Riddle are bullying Team18.

2349
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,700
Yeah, that's their boss.

2350
01:18:16,980 --> 01:18:17,980
They're bullying their boss.

2351
01:18:17,980 --> 01:18:18,160
Oh, really?

2352
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:18,920
Yeah.

2353
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:19,780
Yeah.

2354
01:18:19,780 --> 01:18:20,800
This is their boss.

2355
01:18:21,220 --> 01:18:21,680
It's funny.

2356
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:22,460
And their team owner.

2357
01:18:24,180 --> 01:18:26,420
They're saying, you're not supposed to be here.

2358
01:18:29,020 --> 01:18:30,440
Let them play.

2359
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:33,580
Let them play.

2360
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:34,220
Let them play.

2361
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:34,340
Let them play.

2362
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:39,020
That's funny, though.

2363
01:18:39,260 --> 01:18:40,920
Wait, where are you going, Yuri?

2364
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:43,420
You got phase driver.

2365
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:44,040
I got phase driver.

2366
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:45,980
Oh, very nice.

2367
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:48,640
Yep, yep.

2368
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:52,800
Is it the same for... us, too?

2369
01:18:53,660 --> 01:18:55,060
No, we're on a different map, right?

2370
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:55,580
Oh, no.

2371
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:56,840
Oh, no.

2372
01:18:56,920 --> 01:18:57,840
We have a different map.

2373
01:18:58,100 --> 01:18:58,540
It's okay.

2374
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:01,000
Yuri's full IGLS.

2375
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:02,940
Oh, yeah, are you allowed to?

2376
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:06,360
Yeah, because, like, he's just going to be watching our screen share.

2377
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:09,100
He's going to watch me whip Tencho's.

2378
01:19:09,820 --> 01:19:10,220
Yeah.

2379
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:12,640
He's literally going to come over to my house.

2380
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:13,340
Yeah, because you're going to be too scary, not me.

2381
01:19:13,620 --> 01:19:13,900
Yeah.

2382
01:19:14,820 --> 01:19:17,200
He's going to come over to my house and beat the fuck out of me.

2383
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:20,960
No, he's going to come over to your house and play on your feet.

2384
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:22,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2385
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:23,860
Turn off your cam.

2386
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:27,140
Yeah, turn off your cam right now.

2387
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:30,860
I'll be like, wow, I'm tired.

2388
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:32,660
Your aim right now is so good.

2389
01:19:32,980 --> 01:19:33,380
Wow.

2390
01:19:33,820 --> 01:19:34,220
Yeah.

2391
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:36,600
The things we can do, because this is the first time we've played this game, is we will basically be getting the keep-on-trips.

2392
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:36,740
Oh, is he in Japan?

2393
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:38,040
He is.

2394
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:42,320
Just, just take the Uber right now, the Tire's place.

2395
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:45,160
Guys, I'm here.

2396
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:46,940
It's okay.

2397
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:48,000
Oh, is it going to start?

2398
01:19:49,380 --> 01:19:50,720
He joins the...

2399
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:53,800
Yurish joins the Discord on his phone, so like, no one will know.

2400
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:55,700
Oh, yeah, smart.

2401
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2402
01:20:00,570 --> 01:20:01,990
Is it IBM?

2403
01:20:01,990 --> 01:20:04,430
Yo, next Scars tournament, we should do that.

2404
01:20:05,370 --> 01:20:05,890
Like...

2405
01:20:05,890 --> 01:20:08,230
Yeah, I'll pretend like I'm IGLing.

2406
01:20:09,790 --> 01:20:10,870
I'm not playing.

2407
01:20:13,610 --> 01:20:15,010
Alright guys, I'll...

2408
01:20:15,530 --> 01:20:17,370
For people who are like, what the fuck is going on?

2409
01:20:17,430 --> 01:20:18,390
Let me pin this message.

2410
01:20:19,630 --> 01:20:21,810
Yuris is in a solo match.

2411
01:20:23,030 --> 01:20:24,130
Yeah, we're just watching.

2412
01:20:24,130 --> 01:20:24,970
And I can't...

2413
01:20:28,410 --> 01:20:32,850
And I'm watching via Discord screen share.

2414
01:20:33,130 --> 01:20:34,830
Little sculpt set up.

2415
01:20:36,670 --> 01:20:39,170
Now let me in, I swear I won't ghost.

2416
01:20:39,590 --> 01:20:42,390
I swear I won't tell...

2417
01:20:42,390 --> 01:20:44,690
I won't tell people where you are.

2418
01:20:50,630 --> 01:20:53,070
I should be allowed to spectate.

2419
01:20:55,070 --> 01:20:55,910
Let me in.

2420
01:20:56,130 --> 01:20:58,370
Let me spectate.

2421
01:21:00,530 --> 01:21:03,510
Dude, I just realized I just fucking suck at this game, man.

2422
01:21:03,670 --> 01:21:05,270
You just realized?

2423
01:21:06,630 --> 01:21:07,510
C'mon man.

2424
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:08,650
C'mon man.

2425
01:21:09,390 --> 01:21:11,070
I played a little bit.

2426
01:21:11,570 --> 01:21:12,950
It started.

2427
01:21:13,330 --> 01:21:13,930
Let's go.

2428
01:21:14,430 --> 01:21:15,710
Let's fucking go.

2429
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:20,300
Alright guys.

2430
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:22,620
You're just gonna have...

2431
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:25,120
my commentary next to...

2432
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:26,200
nothing.

2433
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:30,800
Can you guys see it?

2434
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:32,120
Yeah, I'm watching.

2435
01:21:34,740 --> 01:21:35,160
Alright.

2436
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:36,000
Yeah, we're watching.

2437
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:36,700
Let's go.

2438
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:42,120
Alright guys, the map is Olympus, by the way.

2439
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:49,780
I mean, your PC's pretty tanky, right?

2440
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:53,560
It can Discord, stream share, and stream, and play Apex at the same time.

2441
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:55,260
Yeah.

2442
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:56,200
Yeah, it should be fine.

2443
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:57,820
Yeah, it's just like, brrroooom.

2444
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:00,820
Just disconnects from Discord.

2445
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:01,460
Yeah.

2446
01:22:01,460 --> 01:22:02,360
Yeah, yeah.

2447
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:07,600
And then I turn on the news, and I see his computer on fire with his house.

2448
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:09,680
And everything just blows up.

2449
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:12,840
You know, like, the people who aren't doing Discord screen share, they're serious.

2450
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:13,900
They're actually...

2451
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:16,960
I want every bit of Apex right now.

2452
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:17,900
Holy shit.

2453
01:22:18,020 --> 01:22:23,900
Yeah, there's like some people that aren't Discord screen sharing, and then they're just like, they're just like, just watch my stream.

2454
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:26,000
Yeah.

2455
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:26,440
Yeah.

2456
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:27,480
Five second delay, I don't care.

2457
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:29,860
I don't care, just watch the stream.

2458
01:22:35,690 --> 01:22:38,190
You're not the pro player here, I don't need the IGL.

2459
01:22:40,710 --> 01:22:44,190
Alright guys, wait, okay, you guys are gonna be able to hear the game too, chat, don't worry.

2460
01:22:44,970 --> 01:22:47,130
You're gonna be able to hear the game, just not see it.

2461
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,700
Okay, your use is tabbed out, so I can't hear the game.

2462
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:56,620
Yeah, I can hear it.

2463
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:58,980
I can't hear anything though.

2464
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:00,840
Yeah, we do.

2465
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:01,440
Oh, you can't hear it?

2466
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:01,700
Yeah.

2467
01:23:01,820 --> 01:23:03,260
Oh, no, we can hear it now, don't worry.

2468
01:23:03,780 --> 01:23:06,540
No, I think once you start talking, it goes away.

2469
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:08,700
What the fuck?

2470
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:11,160
Oh yeah, what the fuck, that's so weird.

2471
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:12,420
Discord.

2472
01:23:14,140 --> 01:23:16,320
Maybe it's just your recent setup.

2473
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:19,740
It just cuts in and out when he talks.

2474
01:23:20,860 --> 01:23:22,680
No, no, he needs to be talking.

2475
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:24,460
Like, constantly talk.

2476
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:28,500
Oh wait, I have to be fucking talking for you guys to hear it?

2477
01:23:28,660 --> 01:23:29,080
Yeah.

2478
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:31,740
Hey, hey, stop not talking.

2479
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:32,480
Okay.

2480
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:35,100
Does that push the talk on?

2481
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:38,660
And then just have a... get a rock or something and just like...

2482
01:23:38,660 --> 01:23:40,720
put a button on it.

2483
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:43,360
Guys, you're gonna hear...

2484
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:48,500
You're gonna hear like some parts of Yuris' fucking gameplay whenever he talks.

2485
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:50,640
Cause that's when the sound comes out.

2486
01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:52,580
Wait, why is that a thing?

2487
01:23:52,860 --> 01:23:54,380
That's so fucking...

2488
01:23:54,380 --> 01:23:57,040
Is it because the server isn't nitro boosted?

2489
01:23:57,140 --> 01:23:57,800
Is that why?

2490
01:23:58,540 --> 01:23:59,320
Oh, maybe.

2491
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:01,500
Wait, that's a thing?

2492
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:05,840
Bro, I might as... Okay, I'm gonna put your audio on the background from your stream.

2493
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:09,600
It's like a little five minute delay.

2494
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:12,240
Yeah, the little five minute delay.

2495
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:17,420
Oh wait, they're gonna hear like your voice too.

2496
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:23,120
No, I should just watch Yuris' stream on Twitch.

2497
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:26,800
Yeah, but then we're gonna hear his voice on the stream.

2498
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:28,600
Oh yeah, true.

2499
01:24:28,820 --> 01:24:30,640
I can mute in Discord.

2500
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:31,660
Oh yeah.

2501
01:24:31,660 --> 01:24:32,320
I'm just gonna try.

2502
01:24:32,740 --> 01:24:33,800
No, no, you should try.

2503
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:34,640
You need our input.

2504
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:36,080
You need our input here.

2505
01:24:36,420 --> 01:24:37,180
Okay, okay, okay.

2506
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:38,920
Don't worry.

2507
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:40,740
Wait, you want me to stop streaming on Discord now?

2508
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:41,600
No, no, no.

2509
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:45,100
We wanna watch... I'm watching you on the screens... the share.

2510
01:24:45,740 --> 01:24:46,440
Alright, alright.

2511
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:52,920
So yeah, we need that... those five... that five seconds is so important... for us to help you.

2512
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:54,760
That ain't true.

2513
01:24:54,820 --> 01:24:55,440
That ain't live.

2514
01:24:56,200 --> 01:25:00,040
I'm just... I'm just gonna watch the Discord stream with the scuffed audio.

2515
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:04,120
Alright, where's endgame?

2516
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:05,400
What do you think endgame is?

2517
01:25:10,930 --> 01:25:13,370
Oh, do you even have any beacons?

2518
01:25:15,230 --> 01:25:16,650
Wait, Yuris muted himself.

2519
01:25:16,870 --> 01:25:17,230
Oh wait, never mind.

2520
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:22,730
I do, but... man, my loot is ass.

2521
01:25:23,430 --> 01:25:24,450
Can I scan this shit?

2522
01:25:27,090 --> 01:25:27,970
You're a robot.

2523
01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:33,470
He can't... doesn't he need blue armor for the... picket?

2524
01:25:33,490 --> 01:25:35,170
Yeah, I think I need to go level up.

2525
01:25:35,170 --> 01:25:35,250
Yeah.

2526
01:25:35,710 --> 01:25:37,230
Yeah, you need to use the blue armor first.

2527
01:25:38,410 --> 01:25:39,010
Let's go.

2528
01:25:42,790 --> 01:25:43,970
Pick up the powder.

2529
01:25:45,370 --> 01:25:46,690
Alright guys, don't worry.

2530
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:49,610
I'm gonna play... I'm also gonna play...

2531
01:25:49,610 --> 01:25:50,050
I'm gonna get ratted guys.

2532
01:25:50,390 --> 01:25:52,110
Just pray for my heart.

2533
01:25:52,150 --> 01:25:52,910
I'm praying.

2534
01:25:52,950 --> 01:25:53,670
I'm praying for you.

2535
01:25:56,530 --> 01:25:57,710
Sorry I zipped there.

2536
01:25:58,030 --> 01:25:59,450
Oh, I scanned the fucking...

2537
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:04,710
Don't worry guys, I'm gonna play a game as well while I watch Yuris so it looks like a...

2538
01:26:04,710 --> 01:26:08,070
So it looks like we're commentating on my gameplay.

2539
01:26:10,790 --> 01:26:12,070
Wait, you can do that?

2540
01:26:12,110 --> 01:26:16,570
Wait, what happened to the... what happened to the fucking... drops?

2541
01:26:16,770 --> 01:26:18,250
It's just gold... gold and shit.

2542
01:26:18,550 --> 01:26:20,490
No, the first... the first drops are gold.

2543
01:26:21,550 --> 01:26:23,290
The first one are gold and then...

2544
01:26:23,870 --> 01:26:25,730
Oh no, Budoka died!

2545
01:26:26,050 --> 01:26:26,590
Oh no!

2546
01:26:26,830 --> 01:26:27,590
Oh no!

2547
01:26:28,410 --> 01:26:28,890
Yes.

2548
01:26:29,410 --> 01:26:30,790
The team owner is dead.

2549
01:26:31,270 --> 01:26:33,530
You're supposed to feed the riddle team.

2550
01:26:34,710 --> 01:26:36,650
Oh yeah, not fanatic.

2551
01:26:36,850 --> 01:26:37,230
Yeah!

2552
01:26:37,670 --> 01:26:39,610
You're supposed to feed your teammates.

2553
01:26:44,130 --> 01:26:46,970
There's a 20 player in queue and... what the fuck?

2554
01:26:47,030 --> 01:26:48,270
There's no one playing Apex?

2555
01:26:49,270 --> 01:26:52,090
There's no way... Apex can't be dead.

2556
01:26:53,810 --> 01:26:55,970
There's no other game alive right now.

2557
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:03,930
Good aim, yes.

2558
01:27:04,930 --> 01:27:05,490
Yes.

2559
01:27:05,490 --> 01:27:05,910
Very nice.

2560
01:27:06,230 --> 01:27:06,990
Actually this is...

2561
01:27:07,510 --> 01:27:08,670
You got a really good drop.

2562
01:27:08,670 --> 01:27:10,770
Because you can just farm the... the balls.

2563
01:27:12,050 --> 01:27:14,550
Until... until another solo pushes you.

2564
01:27:16,170 --> 01:27:18,670
Yeah, there's someone close in that compound.

2565
01:27:19,170 --> 01:27:21,810
I'm scared of just getting ratted on carry.

2566
01:27:22,210 --> 01:27:24,010
Yeah, solo is like super paranoia.

2567
01:27:24,010 --> 01:27:25,770
That's the scariest thing with solos.

2568
01:27:25,790 --> 01:27:26,190
Yeah.

2569
01:27:27,670 --> 01:27:29,190
Dude, it's a fucking horror game.

2570
01:27:30,350 --> 01:27:31,150
It is.

2571
01:27:31,150 --> 01:27:31,870
It really is.

2572
01:27:32,490 --> 01:27:33,750
It's just so quiet.

2573
01:27:34,230 --> 01:27:34,550
Yeah.

2574
01:27:34,870 --> 01:27:36,570
At least you don't have white armor anymore.

2575
01:27:36,730 --> 01:27:38,590
Because like that's just insta-death as a solo.

2576
01:27:39,350 --> 01:27:39,830
Yeah.

2577
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:45,400
Yeah.

2578
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:46,820
Get another phase driver.

2579
01:27:48,860 --> 01:27:50,880
They're for sure ratting in that...

2580
01:27:53,020 --> 01:27:54,880
How the fuck did like you...

2581
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:56,720
How the fuck did like...

2582
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:58,660
You have found them anyway?

2583
01:27:59,000 --> 01:27:59,700
What the fuck?

2584
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:00,540
Did they...

2585
01:28:00,540 --> 01:28:02,740
Did you think he actually ran at...

2586
01:28:02,740 --> 01:28:04,780
At where the... the team owner's...

2587
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:07,060
Like drop spot was and just to kill him?

2588
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:07,640
Yeah, I mean they...

2589
01:28:07,640 --> 01:28:09,380
Yeah, they had to have done that.

2590
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:10,620
Yeah, because I was like...

2591
01:28:10,620 --> 01:28:10,680
No way.

2592
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:13,400
I was like how the fuck did he die so fast?

2593
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,200
He just walked...

2594
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:19,400
He got like one gun and he's just like I'm ready to beat the shit out of this guy.

2595
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:20,520
I'm gonna take his...

2596
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:21,440
I'm gonna take his loot.

2597
01:28:22,740 --> 01:28:27,100
He must have had a good landing spot if they were willing to take his loot.

2598
01:28:27,540 --> 01:28:28,260
I think so.

2599
01:28:28,420 --> 01:28:29,060
I think so.

2600
01:28:33,690 --> 01:28:34,390
Oh, nice.

2601
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:45,260
Yuris, if you die right now...

2602
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:48,520
You're gonna have the same score as me, unfortunately.

2603
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:49,860
So don't die.

2604
01:28:49,860 --> 01:28:51,560
Oh, there's zero damage?

2605
01:28:51,820 --> 01:28:52,720
The same score as me.

2606
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:54,760
Our team average is starting to pull down right now.

2607
01:28:54,940 --> 01:28:56,160
Our team average.

2608
01:28:57,080 --> 01:28:58,120
It's terrible.

2609
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:01,880
Let's get it.

2610
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:02,760
Not last guys.

2611
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:03,760
Not last.

2612
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:04,680
I'm gonna lock there.

2613
01:29:06,780 --> 01:29:08,980
Signing shit is actually so scary.

2614
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:14,620
I believe in you.

2615
01:29:15,140 --> 01:29:15,660
Did...

2616
01:29:15,660 --> 01:29:17,040
Did turbochargers drop from here?

2617
01:29:17,180 --> 01:29:19,580
I heard a turbocharger is bad for the Havoc.

2618
01:29:19,580 --> 01:29:19,840
It's just like...

2619
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:20,160
In general.

2620
01:29:21,100 --> 01:29:21,580
What?

2621
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:22,360
Because...

2622
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:22,900
From the...

2623
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:23,380
I don't know.

2624
01:29:23,620 --> 01:29:24,020
I don't know.

2625
01:29:24,040 --> 01:29:26,060
A roller player told me this, so I don't know how...

2626
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:27,380
How much I can build.

2627
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:31,720
The source is fucking invalid.

2628
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:34,080
Uncreditable sources.

2629
01:29:36,780 --> 01:29:38,120
So I can't...

2630
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:38,980
I can't...

2631
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:43,060
Oh shit, this guy is lurching.

2632
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:44,960
I have a feeling he's like creeping up on me.

2633
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:46,520
Oh no, I have zone?

2634
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:48,120
You have zone?

2635
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:48,740
That's good!

2636
01:29:48,740 --> 01:29:50,220
You can keep farming phase.

2637
01:29:53,220 --> 01:29:55,160
Hold on, I'm gonna get a position right now.

2638
01:29:55,180 --> 01:29:57,600
I'm scared we're gonna get pulled up on here.

2639
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:01,540
I believe.

2640
01:30:06,170 --> 01:30:07,150
You're not gonna die.

2641
01:30:10,430 --> 01:30:12,070
Yeah, I'm not gonna get rat on, right?

2642
01:30:12,170 --> 01:30:12,750
Yeah, there's no way.

2643
01:30:15,210 --> 01:30:17,670
If there's a rat, we can go beat him up by a row.

2644
01:30:17,850 --> 01:30:18,050
Yeah.

2645
01:30:18,410 --> 01:30:20,150
Yeah, they're all Japanese.

2646
01:30:21,530 --> 01:30:23,310
I am not involved in this.

2647
01:30:23,430 --> 01:30:24,890
I am so far away.

2648
01:30:28,430 --> 01:30:29,550
You're automatically...

2649
01:30:29,550 --> 01:30:31,190
Yeah, I'm an enabler.

2650
01:30:32,450 --> 01:30:34,870
You're like, Doki gave us the idea.

2651
01:30:35,830 --> 01:30:38,590
Her NA ways told us to do it.

2652
01:30:44,330 --> 01:30:45,390
Oh my god.

2653
01:30:45,390 --> 01:30:47,910
I like how you're still farming phase.

2654
01:30:47,970 --> 01:30:49,550
Cause you have nothing else to do.

2655
01:30:50,930 --> 01:30:51,410
Oh.

2656
01:30:51,830 --> 01:30:52,150
Oh.

2657
01:30:53,870 --> 01:30:54,930
There it is.

2658
01:30:55,010 --> 01:30:55,210
There it is.

2659
01:30:55,210 --> 01:30:55,550
There's the rat.

2660
01:30:55,750 --> 01:30:56,410
Oh, there it is.

2661
01:30:57,790 --> 01:30:58,850
We're gonna fight for you.

2662
01:30:58,850 --> 01:30:59,670
He's waiting for you to fuck it.

2663
01:30:59,730 --> 01:31:00,890
Yeah, let's go drive him shut up.

2664
01:31:01,290 --> 01:31:01,490
.

2665
01:31:21,310 --> 01:31:22,710
Just killed a rat.

2666
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:26,420
Where is he?

2667
01:31:26,920 --> 01:31:27,880
Where'd you go?

2668
01:31:44,170 --> 01:31:46,450
This is like a horror movie right now.

2669
01:31:46,710 --> 01:31:46,950
Yeah.

2670
01:31:46,950 --> 01:31:46,970
Yeah.

2671
01:31:48,270 --> 01:31:49,230
The suspense.

2672
01:32:25,210 --> 01:32:27,290
I'm scared of getting shot in the side.

2673
01:32:28,010 --> 01:32:30,350
Yeah, cause you don't know where the other team players are.

2674
01:32:30,350 --> 01:32:30,690
Give me fucking lag shots.

2675
01:32:31,070 --> 01:32:31,550
Yeah.

2676
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:36,460
Can I fight this?

2677
01:32:36,540 --> 01:32:37,780
Is that getting third party?

2678
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:46,200
Bro, no mate, you did that.

2679
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:51,460
We're either doing the same exact shit...

2680
01:32:51,940 --> 01:32:53,820
Yeah, we're like doing the same thing.

2681
01:32:59,670 --> 01:33:01,290
I'm playing a game and watching this.

2682
01:33:01,470 --> 01:33:02,870
I have the most...

2683
01:33:04,850 --> 01:33:06,770
...chance of getting third party.

2684
01:33:20,730 --> 01:33:21,750
Wait, did he move?

2685
01:33:23,270 --> 01:33:25,430
Yeah, he moved to this building.

2686
01:33:28,990 --> 01:33:33,570
I lose that

2687
01:33:37,140 --> 01:33:37,440
fight.

2688
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:38,840
He has a little...

2689
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:39,820
...nemesis.

2690
01:33:40,140 --> 01:33:41,140
I have a Havoc.

2691
01:33:42,220 --> 01:33:43,860
I gotta charge my...

2692
01:33:43,860 --> 01:33:44,960
Yeah, you have to charge your...

2693
01:33:44,980 --> 01:33:46,080
Yeah, he has the ping diff too.

2694
01:33:46,620 --> 01:33:48,940
I mean, you're both in JP though, but...

2695
01:33:49,620 --> 01:33:51,120
...he has more shots into you.

2696
01:33:53,060 --> 01:33:53,540
Yeah.

2697
01:34:00,660 --> 01:34:01,980
I guess you could just chill.

2698
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:02,940
He's not in there though.

2699
01:34:05,820 --> 01:34:06,780
Yeah, 100%.

2700
01:34:06,780 --> 01:34:07,700
Are we fighting?

2701
01:34:13,650 --> 01:34:15,230
Oh, the Sonea's died.

2702
01:34:15,430 --> 01:34:15,470
Ooh.

2703
01:34:15,670 --> 01:34:16,890
The killer just killed the...

2704
01:34:17,370 --> 01:34:19,890
With the repeater in solos.

2705
01:34:19,890 --> 01:34:20,410
What the fuck?

2706
01:34:20,630 --> 01:34:21,090
That's...

2707
01:34:21,090 --> 01:34:23,370
That guy is so confident.

2708
01:34:23,370 --> 01:34:26,570
Yeah, that's so confident.

2709
01:34:27,070 --> 01:34:27,230
Yeah, that is ballsy.

2710
01:34:28,210 --> 01:34:31,770
He's so confident no one's gonna fucking get... like, run up to him.

2711
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:41,440
Holy shit, I can feel my FPS fucking dwingling down.

2712
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:41,960
Oh no.

2713
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:42,980
Oh no.

2714
01:34:46,300 --> 01:34:48,320
It's okay, we don't want to screen share.

2715
01:34:48,380 --> 01:34:49,440
We'll watch from your stream.

2716
01:34:51,340 --> 01:34:52,380
You can just turn it off.

2717
01:34:52,380 --> 01:34:52,760
Too late.

2718
01:34:53,060 --> 01:34:54,560
I just turned it off.

2719
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:54,700
You're committing it.

2720
01:34:55,480 --> 01:34:56,600
But you can always...

2721
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:57,040
You gotta commit.

2722
01:34:57,200 --> 01:34:57,540
Oh, stop!

2723
01:35:09,080 --> 01:35:10,080
No, that's...

2724
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:12,840
Oh my god, your game sound like... trolled me.

2725
01:35:14,420 --> 01:35:14,980
Wow!

2726
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:17,980
No, it wasn't trolled, there was actually people behind me.

2727
01:35:38,410 --> 01:35:38,970
Okay.

2728
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:47,680
Good.

2729
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:50,460
Yeah, this site's so sketch.

2730
01:35:51,380 --> 01:35:53,480
This game is so sketchy.

2731
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:53,960
It is.

2732
01:36:03,250 --> 01:36:05,410
It's a good little cubby.

2733
01:36:05,510 --> 01:36:06,850
No one's hiding here, right?

2734
01:36:07,230 --> 01:36:07,930
Um, oh.

2735
01:36:08,850 --> 01:36:09,690
You can rat.

2736
01:36:11,710 --> 01:36:13,050
That's a bad angle.

2737
01:36:19,570 --> 01:36:20,310
What do you have?

2738
01:36:25,980 --> 01:36:26,420
Oh!

2739
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:36,670
Hey, nice!

2740
01:36:37,030 --> 01:36:37,870
Oh, nice!

2741
01:36:38,630 --> 01:36:39,590
You can tap me!

2742
01:36:39,690 --> 01:36:39,930
Alright, alright, alright.

2743
01:36:40,270 --> 01:36:40,970
Let's fucking go!

2744
01:36:41,590 --> 01:36:42,690
You're so much better!

2745
01:36:42,710 --> 01:36:44,230
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, who's this guy?

2746
01:36:52,780 --> 01:36:53,860
Getting shot at.

2747
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:55,660
We got this.

2748
01:37:20,980 --> 01:37:22,140
Whoa, top 8.

2749
01:37:37,340 --> 01:37:39,580
Oh shit, that guy's got a little...

2750
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:46,260
Oh my god.

2751
01:37:46,300 --> 01:37:46,560
No!

2752
01:37:46,580 --> 01:37:48,720
Yeah, dude, he actually creeped me.

2753
01:37:49,300 --> 01:37:50,660
Bro, he got creeped!

2754
01:37:50,660 --> 01:37:52,940
He has a little Digi threat, bro.

2755
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:54,360
Yeah, Digi!

2756
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:58,160
Top 8 and a creeper man!

2757
01:38:00,420 --> 01:38:01,120
It's okay.

2758
01:38:01,220 --> 01:38:02,380
Holy shit, that's a good shot.

2759
01:38:02,420 --> 01:38:03,720
Yeah, it was a good shot.

2760
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:04,340
Yeah.

2761
01:38:04,760 --> 01:38:08,020
Was it like two different solos or was he the one that...

2762
01:38:08,500 --> 01:38:09,720
Were you 1v1ing him?

2763
01:38:11,100 --> 01:38:12,120
Nah, it was a 1v1.

2764
01:38:12,340 --> 01:38:13,820
He hit the Kraber and then just...

2765
01:38:13,820 --> 01:38:14,720
He hit the Kraber and then a 1v1?

2766
01:38:14,720 --> 01:38:15,460
He hit the Kraber, yeah.

2767
01:38:15,560 --> 01:38:17,440
Once he got that Kraber shot...

2768
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:18,720
It was GG's.

2769
01:38:18,860 --> 01:38:19,140
Yeah.

2770
01:38:19,420 --> 01:38:21,120
That's insane that he got it.

2771
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:21,340
It was over.

2772
01:38:22,340 --> 01:38:23,780
You're just farming points now.

2773
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,100
Oh my god.

2774
01:38:25,240 --> 01:38:25,460
Yup.

2775
01:38:26,580 --> 01:38:28,360
Oh, you kept...

2776
01:38:28,360 --> 01:38:29,880
Ah, the Kraber, man.

2777
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:31,720
Dude, everyone's just hiding.

2778
01:38:31,980 --> 01:38:32,400
Oh, he's just farming points now.

2779
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:33,600
Yeah, everyone's scared of the Lee Sonic Kraber.

2780
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:33,960
Holy shit.

2781
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:35,420
Wait, that was a blue armor though.

2782
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:36,200
What the heck?

2783
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:37,280
How did he not die?

2784
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:38,760
Yeah.

2785
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:39,540
Not headshot?

2786
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:41,360
No, it was a headshot.

2787
01:38:41,580 --> 01:38:42,020
Wait, what?

2788
01:38:43,060 --> 01:38:43,540
189.

2789
01:38:43,540 --> 01:38:44,000
There he was.

2790
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:45,360
It was 189 to a blue.

2791
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:45,980
What the fuck?

2792
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:47,520
Wait, math?

2793
01:38:49,100 --> 01:38:50,100
God damn it.

2794
01:38:50,440 --> 01:38:52,440
I got fucking Octane styled on.

2795
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:58,220
Oh yeah, that guy... that guy can't even do anything.

2796
01:38:58,480 --> 01:38:59,460
He's just in smoke.

2797
01:39:00,820 --> 01:39:01,780
Oh my god.

2798
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:02,380
You can't have a smoke.

2799
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:03,760
He's just actually fucking farming.

2800
01:39:07,980 --> 01:39:08,820
Holy shit.

2801
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:10,040
He does not care, bro.

2802
01:39:10,260 --> 01:39:11,540
Bro, what the fuck?

2803
01:39:11,820 --> 01:39:12,320
Oh my god.

2804
01:39:12,340 --> 01:39:15,220
If he hit that, that was so good if he hit that shot.

2805
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:15,660
Yeah.

2806
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:17,940
If he fucking hit that, holy shit.

2807
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:19,300
That would've been a montage.

2808
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:21,260
No, you kept...

2809
01:39:21,260 --> 01:39:22,040
Wait, no.

2810
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:22,580
That guy's scared.

2811
01:39:22,660 --> 01:39:23,180
That guy got scared.

2812
01:39:23,420 --> 01:39:23,840
He got scared.

2813
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:26,520
It's Kraber, we...

2814
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:28,280
Why are you so scared?

2815
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:29,660
Dude, he's on the boat.

2816
01:39:29,860 --> 01:39:30,020
Bro, bro.

2817
01:39:30,580 --> 01:39:31,200
He's so...

2818
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:31,680
Wait.

2819
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:33,600
What the fuck?

2820
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:34,040
He's on the boat.

2821
01:39:34,160 --> 01:39:34,960
He's on the boat.

2822
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:35,120
He's on the boat.

2823
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:35,700
He's on the boat.

2824
01:39:35,700 --> 01:39:36,860
Oh my god.

2825
01:39:41,030 --> 01:39:41,910
He has...

2826
01:39:41,910 --> 01:39:42,130
No!

2827
01:39:42,750 --> 01:39:43,550
You can't.

2828
01:39:43,590 --> 01:39:43,610
He's dead.

2829
01:39:45,150 --> 01:39:45,590
Yeah.

2830
01:39:46,470 --> 01:39:46,910
1v1.

2831
01:39:49,310 --> 01:39:50,470
It's a Rev 2.

2832
01:39:50,890 --> 01:39:52,010
What the fuck is that?

2833
01:39:53,810 --> 01:39:54,730
What is he holding?

2834
01:39:55,930 --> 01:39:56,770
What does he have?

2835
01:39:56,990 --> 01:39:58,270
Does he have like a Bangalore Heirloom?

2836
01:39:58,390 --> 01:40:01,110
No, that's the new Heirloom, the knife thing.

2837
01:40:01,570 --> 01:40:02,510
Oh my god.

2838
01:40:02,570 --> 01:40:04,050
He fucking destroyed him too.

2839
01:40:04,190 --> 01:40:04,590
Holy shit.

2840
01:40:04,850 --> 01:40:07,090
Oh, the fucking Horizon Q.

2841
01:40:07,110 --> 01:40:07,590
The Horizon Q.

2842
01:40:07,590 --> 01:40:07,670
The Horizon Q.

2843
01:40:07,730 --> 01:40:08,530
The Horizon Q.

2844
01:40:08,530 --> 01:40:09,310
Oh, the Havoc beam.

2845
01:40:10,670 --> 01:40:11,550
The Horizon Q.

2846
01:40:12,930 --> 01:40:13,370
Yeah.

2847
01:40:13,370 --> 01:40:14,170
Oh my god.

2848
01:40:14,190 --> 01:40:14,630
All right.

2849
01:40:14,670 --> 01:40:14,910
Wait.

2850
01:40:14,930 --> 01:40:16,430
Why did that guy not use his ult?

2851
01:40:16,850 --> 01:40:17,410
Where's the Rev?

2852
01:40:17,690 --> 01:40:18,210
He got scared.

2853
01:40:18,290 --> 01:40:19,010
He got scared.

2854
01:40:21,390 --> 01:40:22,670
Wait, my Apex crashed.

2855
01:40:22,830 --> 01:40:23,350
I just realized.

2856
01:40:23,570 --> 01:40:24,990
Oh, thank god you crashed now instead of...

2857
01:40:25,490 --> 01:40:26,250
Oh god.

2858
01:40:26,550 --> 01:40:27,150
Yeah, yeah.

2859
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:32,000
Man, that sucks.

2860
01:40:32,280 --> 01:40:32,860
Losing to a...

2861
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:34,780
I hate losing to a fucking Kraber.

2862
01:40:34,900 --> 01:40:35,500
He better have...

2863
01:40:37,620 --> 01:40:38,160
It's okay.

2864
01:40:38,360 --> 01:40:38,740
It's like...

2865
01:40:38,740 --> 01:40:39,900
Almost like you got third place.

2866
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:40,820
You know?

2867
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:41,940
It's almost like...

2868
01:40:41,940 --> 01:40:43,100
That is true.

2869
01:40:44,820 --> 01:40:46,640
I mean you started on that one guys.

2870
01:40:47,720 --> 01:40:48,540
That's all that matters.

2871
01:40:48,660 --> 01:40:49,320
That's what matters.

2872
01:40:49,820 --> 01:40:51,900
I won my 1v1 to Tapii.

2873
01:40:52,640 --> 01:40:55,000
Yeah, remember he won his 1v1.

2874
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:55,520
That's what matters.

2875
01:40:55,780 --> 01:40:57,920
That is what matters guys.

2876
01:40:59,700 --> 01:41:00,740
That's all that matters.

2877
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:02,360
He won the 1v1 guys.

2878
01:41:02,780 --> 01:41:04,320
He won the 1v1.

2879
01:41:05,020 --> 01:41:07,760
Oh no, my Apex is crashing like a madman.

2880
01:41:08,280 --> 01:41:09,400
Oh no.

2881
01:41:10,520 --> 01:41:10,800
Wait.

2882
01:41:11,620 --> 01:41:12,180
Wait.

2883
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:13,240
Not now.

2884
01:41:13,640 --> 01:41:15,180
Not now we have duels.

2885
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:20,320
Well, I'm gonna leave this fucking quick play game.

2886
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:24,000
I'll watch you guys now.

2887
01:41:24,220 --> 01:41:26,500
It's my time to ideal.

2888
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:28,700
Yeah, you gotta ideal us.

2889
01:41:29,720 --> 01:41:31,320
Okay, there's a new lobby code.

2890
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:32,780
Alright, I'm sorry to this one team.

2891
01:41:33,480 --> 01:41:34,300
Good luck.

2892
01:41:34,860 --> 01:41:36,740
Good luck randoms.

2893
01:41:39,260 --> 01:41:40,240
Hopefully it doesn't crash.

2894
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:41,320
Hopefully it doesn't crash.

2895
01:41:41,980 --> 01:41:42,920
No crash please.

2896
01:41:45,220 --> 01:41:46,320
Rise of Hayao?

2897
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:48,640
You have like, you always have problems with it.

2898
01:41:48,760 --> 01:41:49,940
Yeah, no I always crash.

2899
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:51,200
Right?

2900
01:41:52,780 --> 01:41:54,840
It's like always been like this with Hayao.

2901
01:41:55,120 --> 01:41:56,680
It's like they don't want me to play.

2902
01:41:56,980 --> 01:42:06,060
It's like the Apex is like known to be, you know, not the greatest monetized game, optimized game out there.

2903
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:10,660
You know, the optimization is just not the best.

2904
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:13,360
They just want me to go back to Overwatch.

2905
01:42:15,140 --> 01:42:16,460
That's so fucked up.

2906
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:20,160
Okay, where are we landing?

2907
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:22,460
Wait, where are we landing?

2908
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:24,040
Duos...

2909
01:42:25,580 --> 01:42:26,620
Olympus... one...

2910
01:42:26,620 --> 01:42:28,000
Oh, FaceDriver.

2911
01:42:28,160 --> 01:42:29,520
Oh, we got FaceDriver too!

2912
01:42:30,500 --> 01:42:31,840
We're gonna share FaceDriver.

2913
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:32,860
Is it also?

2914
01:42:33,900 --> 01:42:34,700
Is it actually?

2915
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:35,040
Is it not?

2916
01:42:36,700 --> 01:42:38,180
Yeah, I think it's exactly the same.

2917
01:42:38,260 --> 01:42:38,400
Yeah.

2918
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:40,100
Okay, nice.

2919
01:42:40,360 --> 01:42:42,040
Alright, I hope they don't start yet.

2920
01:42:42,120 --> 01:42:43,400
Wait, wait, what comp do we play?

2921
01:42:44,260 --> 01:42:44,520
Coach!

2922
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:46,200
Coach!

2923
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,820
Actually, wait, wait, wait.

2924
01:42:49,940 --> 01:42:51,280
I've learned this from experience.

2925
01:42:51,580 --> 01:42:53,740
Duo is way fucking sweatier.

2926
01:42:53,940 --> 01:42:55,620
Like, it's actually like a trio game.

2927
01:42:55,960 --> 01:43:00,600
So, something that could like get in, you know, like a little get in zone.

2928
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:02,160
Like a...

2929
01:43:02,860 --> 01:43:04,800
Valak Blood or Valak Bang.

2930
01:43:05,080 --> 01:43:07,820
Maybe Valak Blood for like the scan, you know?

2931
01:43:07,900 --> 01:43:08,700
Okay, okay.

2932
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:10,260
I'm gonna leave the lobby.

2933
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:12,880
And I'm gonna go to the bathroom real quick.

2934
01:43:13,180 --> 01:43:13,700
Okay.

2935
01:43:13,860 --> 01:43:14,600
Yo, me too.

2936
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:16,100
Yuris, entertain our chat.

2937
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:19,120
What the heck?

2938
01:43:19,240 --> 01:43:20,700
Hey guys!

2939
01:43:21,900 --> 01:43:24,380
What the fuck is happening?

2940
01:43:25,680 --> 01:43:26,200
Entertaining.

2941
01:43:26,760 --> 01:43:28,200
Yeah, you guys enjoying this tournament?

2942
01:43:29,100 --> 01:43:29,620
Um...

2943
01:43:32,300 --> 01:43:32,820
Light...

2944
01:43:32,860 --> 01:43:34,840
Like and subscribe in the channel.

2945
01:43:35,100 --> 01:43:36,200
If you haven't subscribed.

2946
01:43:37,400 --> 01:43:40,180
How do you entertain a fucking chat?

2947
01:43:40,460 --> 01:43:42,300
Usually chat just entertain themselves.

2948
01:43:57,400 --> 01:43:58,040
Streamer...

2949
01:43:58,040 --> 01:43:58,900
Listen, listen, listen.

2950
01:43:59,080 --> 01:43:59,960
This is what I think, alright?

2951
01:44:00,280 --> 01:44:02,180
I think a chat...

2952
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:06,060
Chat is like an embodiment of their streamer.

2953
01:44:06,120 --> 01:44:07,000
I think...

2954
01:44:08,240 --> 01:44:09,520
I think...

2955
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:10,140
I think...

2956
01:44:11,220 --> 01:44:15,920
How you are a streamer reflects your chat.

2957
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:17,800
So, what's going on here?

2958
01:44:17,900 --> 01:44:19,720
How is Doki's...

2959
01:44:20,540 --> 01:44:21,940
Chat right here?

2960
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:23,600
How are you?

2961
01:44:23,720 --> 01:44:25,660
What would you guys describe yourself?

2962
01:44:29,160 --> 01:44:29,720
Tomatoes.

2963
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:32,080
I see.

2964
01:44:32,860 --> 01:44:33,420
Gaslighters.

2965
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:34,480
We like yapping.

2966
01:44:41,320 --> 01:44:42,080
Oh god.

2967
01:44:46,940 --> 01:44:47,800
Oh shit.

2968
01:44:48,540 --> 01:44:49,480
I'm running.

2969
01:44:50,220 --> 01:44:51,480
I'm running back.

2970
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:53,880
Why were you like, oh shit.

2971
01:44:53,940 --> 01:44:54,580
Oh god.

2972
01:44:54,600 --> 01:44:54,920
Oh god.

2973
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:57,520
You started moving.

2974
01:44:57,880 --> 01:44:58,520
I saw.

2975
01:44:58,780 --> 01:44:59,820
You started moving.

2976
01:45:01,060 --> 01:45:03,900
I wanted to know what you were saying.

2977
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:07,240
I wonder what Yurisa is going to do to entertain.

2978
01:45:07,960 --> 01:45:08,360
I wonder what Yurisa is going to do to entertain.

2979
01:45:11,460 --> 01:45:12,440
Okay, what do I do?

2980
01:45:12,760 --> 01:45:14,480
Okay, blood valk.

2981
01:45:15,460 --> 01:45:15,900
Okay.

2982
01:45:16,100 --> 01:45:17,180
I feel like we got to stick together.

2983
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:20,880
Because I feel like if we are separated, they are going to pick us off so fast.

2984
01:45:21,300 --> 01:45:23,100
Yeah, I'm a stupid person.

2985
01:45:23,100 --> 01:45:23,780
That is a good strat.

2986
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:26,180
I have... that's revolutionary.

2987
01:45:27,720 --> 01:45:28,400
Yeah, yeah.

2988
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:32,540
We just got to stick together so we don't individually get picked off.

2989
01:45:34,280 --> 01:45:37,880
We just got to make sure we have blue armor by the time someone rolls up on us.

2990
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:39,960
That's true.

2991
01:45:40,120 --> 01:45:40,300
That's true.

2992
01:45:41,540 --> 01:45:42,880
Look at the sky.

2993
01:45:43,240 --> 01:45:45,260
Yurisa got like super lucky with the zone too.

2994
01:45:45,380 --> 01:45:46,640
It like literally pulled onto him.

2995
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:49,800
I'm going to be honest with you.

2996
01:45:49,900 --> 01:45:52,000
I actually hate having zones in solo.

2997
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,540
Wait, oh I guess like solos are scarier.

2998
01:45:54,660 --> 01:45:56,320
Yeah, because you can't just walk up.

2999
01:45:56,360 --> 01:45:57,060
Yeah, yeah.

3000
01:45:57,140 --> 01:45:58,220
You can't walk up to people.

3001
01:45:58,420 --> 01:45:59,700
You have to actually...

3002
01:46:00,280 --> 01:46:01,980
You have to actually like look around.

3003
01:46:02,140 --> 01:46:03,420
Yeah, I'm the one that got walked up.

3004
01:46:03,420 --> 01:46:04,120
Yeah, yeah.

3005
01:46:05,860 --> 01:46:07,120
I get that, yeah.

3006
01:46:08,260 --> 01:46:09,140
Okay, it's okay.

3007
01:46:09,300 --> 01:46:11,880
If we have zones as duos, then it will be better.

3008
01:46:11,880 --> 01:46:12,720
Wait, there's Cheeki?

3009
01:46:13,300 --> 01:46:13,980
Yeah, yeah.

3010
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:15,040
Cheeki is the content creator.

3011
01:46:15,260 --> 01:46:17,140
Oh yeah, you guys are playing against Telly.

3012
01:46:17,240 --> 01:46:18,020
Yeah, yeah.

3013
01:46:18,020 --> 01:46:19,180
Is Telly a Cheeki?

3014
01:46:20,260 --> 01:46:20,780
Yeah.

3015
01:46:21,220 --> 01:46:23,020
You guys excited?

3016
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:25,140
What's the confidence looking like?

3017
01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:26,320
I'm so confident.

3018
01:46:27,240 --> 01:46:28,060
You know what?

3019
01:46:28,980 --> 01:46:29,860
We're better.

3020
01:46:30,040 --> 01:46:31,040
We're so much better.

3021
01:46:31,240 --> 01:46:33,800
Like I might not have never got rank 1, but we're so...

3022
01:46:34,740 --> 01:46:40,380
I might have averaged 30 damage per game, but I'm just better.

3023
01:46:40,860 --> 01:46:42,720
Listen, it's time to up it out right now.

3024
01:46:43,100 --> 01:46:43,880
Is it?

3025
01:46:44,300 --> 01:46:45,860
I believe in you, Tayo.

3026
01:46:47,060 --> 01:46:48,000
You're literally the best.

3027
01:46:48,020 --> 01:46:50,520
You're literally supposed to be like the Cheeki of our team.

3028
01:47:01,280 --> 01:47:02,700
I'm ready to just...

3029
01:47:02,700 --> 01:47:05,900
I'm ready to click on the phase driver thing.

3030
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:06,200
Yeah, yeah.

3031
01:47:06,200 --> 01:47:07,120
That's like my main goal.

3032
01:47:07,400 --> 01:47:08,180
You know, I have advice.

3033
01:47:08,620 --> 01:47:09,200
You know like...

3034
01:47:09,200 --> 01:47:11,880
Just click the phase driver.

3035
01:47:12,580 --> 01:47:14,720
I wish you could get armor off of that.

3036
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:16,760
Just clicking the button over and over again.

3037
01:47:16,760 --> 01:47:17,180
Yeah, just like 50.

3038
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:18,000
I'm like, I'm just gonna click the button.

3039
01:47:18,020 --> 01:47:19,660
50, 50, 50.

3040
01:47:19,700 --> 01:47:21,000
Plus 50, plus 50.

3041
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:24,660
What are we waiting for?

3042
01:47:25,160 --> 01:47:28,040
Wait, why is team 10 three people?

3043
01:47:28,440 --> 01:47:29,360
What the fuck?

3044
01:47:31,340 --> 01:47:32,800
Wait a minute.

3045
01:47:33,340 --> 01:47:33,620
What is that?

3046
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:36,360
Yo.

3047
01:47:36,680 --> 01:47:37,780
Are you gonna stream?

3048
01:47:39,300 --> 01:47:40,780
Are you gonna watch our stream?

3049
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:42,780
I'll watch your stream.

3050
01:47:42,820 --> 01:47:43,800
Yeah, we're not gonna...

3051
01:47:44,460 --> 01:47:45,500
I can't...

3052
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:47,900
Can't IGL with a little delay, huh?

3053
01:47:48,040 --> 01:47:49,280
Can you see this one?

3054
01:47:50,100 --> 01:47:50,820
It's okay.

3055
01:47:50,900 --> 01:47:54,560
Maybe Tyler's PC is much more optimized.

3056
01:47:54,900 --> 01:47:56,100
Oh shit, there's code right there.

3057
01:47:57,320 --> 01:47:58,280
Can you see this?

3058
01:47:58,440 --> 01:47:59,660
Did you leak the code?

3059
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:02,160
No, no, no.

3060
01:48:02,220 --> 01:48:03,400
I never do that.

3061
01:48:03,560 --> 01:48:04,500
I never leak.

3062
01:48:04,700 --> 01:48:07,440
Oh shit, there's a code right there.

3063
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:08,320
I don't know.

3064
01:48:08,420 --> 01:48:09,620
I heard, oh shit.

3065
01:48:09,680 --> 01:48:11,220
There's a code right there.

3066
01:48:11,480 --> 01:48:13,420
That does not give me confidence.

3067
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:15,320
It was to his bank account.

3068
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:16,500
It's not a thing too big.

3069
01:48:17,380 --> 01:48:18,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3070
01:48:18,740 --> 01:48:19,780
Just his bank account.

3071
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:23,720
That's fine.

3072
01:48:30,570 --> 01:48:31,250
Wait, wait.

3073
01:48:31,430 --> 01:48:32,190
Okay, now there's two.

3074
01:48:33,010 --> 01:48:33,490
Okay.

3075
01:48:34,490 --> 01:48:35,210
We're starting.

3076
01:48:35,950 --> 01:48:41,790
Literally, if we kill Cheeki, I'm expecting $100,000 in the bank account by tomorrow.

3077
01:48:44,150 --> 01:48:45,770
That's just all I'm saying.

3078
01:48:45,950 --> 01:48:47,210
Like, Scars...

3079
01:48:48,750 --> 01:48:50,550
If I kill this man...

3080
01:48:51,810 --> 01:48:52,250
Destroyer.

3081
01:48:52,390 --> 01:48:54,030
Destroyer, come help him right now.

3082
01:48:54,710 --> 01:48:55,150
What's it?

3083
01:48:55,350 --> 01:48:55,790
Destroyer69.

3084
01:48:58,090 --> 01:48:58,530
Alright.

3085
01:48:58,970 --> 01:49:00,250
Wait, where's FaceDriver?

3086
01:49:00,250 --> 01:49:00,710
I'm scared.

3087
01:49:02,170 --> 01:49:02,610
Daddy!

3088
01:49:03,510 --> 01:49:04,430
You're a GLS Jumpmaster.

3089
01:49:05,290 --> 01:49:07,810
You're a GLS Jumpmaster.

3090
01:49:10,130 --> 01:49:11,110
Wait, where am I?

3091
01:49:11,270 --> 01:49:11,750
Oh, there you go.

3092
01:49:11,790 --> 01:49:13,590
I was gonna say, I'm not being mad, Maggie.

3093
01:49:15,250 --> 01:49:16,050
Wait, can I...

3094
01:49:16,550 --> 01:49:17,170
Actually, no.

3095
01:49:17,950 --> 01:49:18,610
I don't know.

3096
01:49:20,190 --> 01:49:22,170
I would say bang, but...

3097
01:49:22,170 --> 01:49:22,710
I don't know.

3098
01:49:22,950 --> 01:49:24,430
He said, he said, blood...

3099
01:49:25,050 --> 01:49:27,330
Blood... Well, I have scans for you, right?

3100
01:49:27,470 --> 01:49:29,670
Because, like, I scan, and then...

3101
01:49:29,670 --> 01:49:32,210
And then you shoot them, right?

3102
01:49:33,010 --> 01:49:33,810
Yeah, that's the plan.

3103
01:49:34,070 --> 01:49:34,550
That's the plan.

3104
01:49:34,550 --> 01:49:35,370
That's what we said.

3105
01:49:35,730 --> 01:49:38,690
Okay, this is where you boost up your average.

3106
01:49:39,590 --> 01:49:40,270
That's true.

3107
01:49:40,370 --> 01:49:42,170
This is the average boosting count.

3108
01:49:42,190 --> 01:49:43,230
You're my hype man.

3109
01:49:43,370 --> 01:49:44,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I believe.

3110
01:49:44,510 --> 01:49:46,030
Okay, FaceDriver is...

3111
01:49:47,350 --> 01:49:48,310
Right... Where?

3112
01:49:48,830 --> 01:49:49,230
There?

3113
01:49:50,550 --> 01:49:51,530
No, there it is.

3114
01:49:51,750 --> 01:49:52,530
Yeah, there.

3115
01:49:52,730 --> 01:49:53,290
I see it.

3116
01:49:53,430 --> 01:49:54,430
Okay, I'm dropping...

3117
01:49:57,290 --> 01:49:57,930
Eventually... Oh, wait.

3118
01:49:58,230 --> 01:49:58,630
Okay.

3119
01:50:01,230 --> 01:50:02,350
What's the fastest way?

3120
01:50:02,450 --> 01:50:03,490
Is it like 700, 600?

3121
01:50:04,110 --> 01:50:05,390
I think someone told me.

3122
01:50:07,050 --> 01:50:07,450
Yuris?

3123
01:50:07,470 --> 01:50:07,670
Yuris?

3124
01:50:08,150 --> 01:50:08,550
Coach!

3125
01:50:11,410 --> 01:50:12,230
Wait, Coach!

3126
01:50:12,270 --> 01:50:13,330
Don't leave us, Coach!

3127
01:50:13,510 --> 01:50:14,790
Is he not allowed to talk?

3128
01:50:14,790 --> 01:50:16,350
Yeah, he should be.

3129
01:50:16,730 --> 01:50:17,970
He's just watching us.

3130
01:50:18,730 --> 01:50:19,950
Wait, what the fuck?

3131
01:50:19,970 --> 01:50:21,770
I can't talk when I'm watching the stream.

3132
01:50:23,670 --> 01:50:26,870
Bro, what's wrong with your Discord?

3133
01:50:28,070 --> 01:50:30,110
Your Discord is bugged.

3134
01:50:30,110 --> 01:50:32,130
Bro, we're just like, Coach, Coach!

3135
01:50:33,330 --> 01:50:34,650
How do I do that?

3136
01:50:34,730 --> 01:50:36,590
I guess you're just gonna be watching...

3137
01:50:36,590 --> 01:50:37,290
No, no, it's a bug.

3138
01:50:37,450 --> 01:50:37,850
It's a bug.

3139
01:50:38,090 --> 01:50:39,050
There's nothing you can do.

3140
01:50:39,470 --> 01:50:40,070
Wait, it is?

3141
01:50:40,170 --> 01:50:41,510
I can't fix it?

3142
01:50:42,410 --> 01:50:44,690
You have to reinstall Discord or something, I think.

3143
01:50:44,690 --> 01:50:46,170
What the fuck?

3144
01:50:46,730 --> 01:50:49,010
What is wrong with your Discord?

3145
01:50:49,230 --> 01:50:50,930
I've been talking the entire time.

3146
01:50:51,210 --> 01:50:52,990
He hasn't been trying to coach you.

3147
01:50:52,990 --> 01:50:53,610
No, you are not, Coach.

3148
01:50:55,590 --> 01:50:57,010
I pressed the button.

3149
01:50:57,550 --> 01:50:59,030
I'm pulling out the Sentinel.

3150
01:51:00,090 --> 01:51:00,610
Bro!

3151
01:51:00,790 --> 01:51:01,910
It's Duo's!

3152
01:51:01,910 --> 01:51:03,530
Why are you pulling out the Sentinel?

3153
01:51:05,730 --> 01:51:07,770
Is this not a valid strat, Coach?

3154
01:51:08,150 --> 01:51:09,630
Coach, we need your help.

3155
01:51:11,810 --> 01:51:12,330
Coach!

3156
01:51:14,690 --> 01:51:14,930
Coach!

3157
01:51:15,150 --> 01:51:15,630
Coach!

3158
01:51:17,930 --> 01:51:19,090
I watched your stream.

3159
01:51:19,230 --> 01:51:21,550
I watched your stream.

3160
01:51:21,550 --> 01:51:25,270
Is Sentinel not a valid option?

3161
01:51:27,210 --> 01:51:29,850
Listen, if you hit your shots, it's any gun, bro.

3162
01:51:30,390 --> 01:51:30,870
True.

3163
01:51:31,610 --> 01:51:34,070
And what was the fucking track record?

3164
01:51:34,170 --> 01:51:35,390
The last two games?

3165
01:51:35,910 --> 01:51:36,390
30!

3166
01:51:38,570 --> 01:51:39,470
I'm saying it again.

3167
01:51:39,470 --> 01:51:40,030
I didn't shoot.

3168
01:51:40,250 --> 01:51:40,890
I didn't shoot.

3169
01:51:41,110 --> 01:51:41,650
That is true.

3170
01:51:44,690 --> 01:51:46,470
I guess you can say that.

3171
01:51:46,630 --> 01:51:47,990
I pressed the face driver.

3172
01:51:48,610 --> 01:51:51,030
We need to get armors.

3173
01:51:51,330 --> 01:51:52,830
I'll scan later.

3174
01:51:55,030 --> 01:51:55,630
Oh yeah.

3175
01:51:55,630 --> 01:51:56,770
We really need armors.

3176
01:51:56,770 --> 01:51:58,890
We can't be going in there with our whiteys.

3177
01:52:01,170 --> 01:52:03,850
I'm gonna pull out the Peacekeeper.

3178
01:52:06,450 --> 01:52:08,350
Oh, there's a helmet here.

3179
01:52:08,950 --> 01:52:09,710
Yes, sir.

3180
01:52:10,510 --> 01:52:11,110
Okay.

3181
01:52:12,970 --> 01:52:13,370
Okay.

3182
01:52:13,450 --> 01:52:15,190
Okay, Tyra's stream is like two seconds delayed.

3183
01:52:15,930 --> 01:52:16,590
That's fine.

3184
01:52:16,990 --> 01:52:17,630
Yeah, okay.

3185
01:52:17,670 --> 01:52:18,030
That's good.

3186
01:52:18,090 --> 01:52:18,450
That's fine.

3187
01:52:18,550 --> 01:52:20,190
That should be easy.

3188
01:52:20,210 --> 01:52:23,170
You can remove the stream on Discord now.

3189
01:52:23,170 --> 01:52:24,370
Yeah, you can get your ping.

3190
01:52:24,610 --> 01:52:25,490
Get the little FPS.

3191
01:52:26,090 --> 01:52:27,510
My computer is too strong.

3192
01:52:27,590 --> 01:52:28,290
It does not care.

3193
01:52:28,730 --> 01:52:29,130
Whoa!

3194
01:52:30,390 --> 01:52:30,790
Humble brag.

3195
01:52:32,830 --> 01:52:34,110
Go for it, bro.

3196
01:52:34,370 --> 01:52:35,210
I'm gonna go scan then.

3197
01:52:35,370 --> 01:52:37,010
Can you cover me just in case?

3198
01:52:37,330 --> 01:52:37,850
Yes, yes, yes.

3199
01:52:37,910 --> 01:52:38,190
I'm coming.

3200
01:52:38,350 --> 01:52:38,510
I'm coming.

3201
01:52:38,910 --> 01:52:39,310
Alright.

3202
01:52:40,050 --> 01:52:41,670
What else can we do to grab our...

3203
01:52:41,670 --> 01:52:42,190
Oh, wait.

3204
01:52:42,250 --> 01:52:43,350
We have to grab the...

3205
01:52:44,650 --> 01:52:46,750
Do you guys not have harvesters inside?

3206
01:52:47,370 --> 01:52:48,330
Yeah, we do.

3207
01:52:48,430 --> 01:52:49,170
We have one here.

3208
01:52:49,870 --> 01:52:52,910
I'm gonna scan right now just to make sure we're okay.

3209
01:52:53,110 --> 01:52:53,750
Hopefully it's just not cheeky.

3210
01:52:53,750 --> 01:52:54,790
Yeah, we can get the Evo.

3211
01:52:57,110 --> 01:52:59,650
Look around where everyone's trying to play.

3212
01:53:00,550 --> 01:53:01,450
Where are they trying to play?

3213
01:53:01,570 --> 01:53:02,150
No clue.

3214
01:53:02,330 --> 01:53:03,170
No fucking clue.

3215
01:53:03,370 --> 01:53:03,830
What is this?

3216
01:53:03,910 --> 01:53:08,330
You can scan the drop style right now.

3217
01:53:08,370 --> 01:53:08,490
Okay.

3218
01:53:08,510 --> 01:53:09,210
If you look at the sky.

3219
01:53:09,410 --> 01:53:09,510
Okay.

3220
01:53:10,770 --> 01:53:13,070
Wait, where are they?

3221
01:53:14,110 --> 01:53:15,430
I think they all already dropped.

3222
01:53:15,750 --> 01:53:16,570
Oh, I'm stupid.

3223
01:53:17,790 --> 01:53:18,650
Where's zone ending?

3224
01:53:18,890 --> 01:53:19,530
Where do we go?

3225
01:53:19,650 --> 01:53:20,230
I'm curious.

3226
01:53:22,290 --> 01:53:25,310
Just loot towards the circle for now.

3227
01:53:25,450 --> 01:53:26,290
Take your time.

3228
01:53:26,410 --> 01:53:28,490
And play for the next zone.

3229
01:53:29,090 --> 01:53:29,530
Okay.

3230
01:53:29,670 --> 01:53:31,010
I dropped a 3x.

3231
01:53:31,430 --> 01:53:34,930
Once you see the next zone, find a little...

3232
01:53:34,930 --> 01:53:36,070
I'm gonna use 2.

3233
01:53:36,530 --> 01:53:38,050
And then you guys play for that.

3234
01:53:39,230 --> 01:53:40,110
Oh, no.

3235
01:53:40,110 --> 01:53:42,470
I don't know the new system of beacons and shit.

3236
01:53:42,610 --> 01:53:43,050
Like...

3237
01:53:44,810 --> 01:53:46,250
I thought I could scan it.

3238
01:53:46,850 --> 01:53:47,290
Yeah.

3239
01:53:47,310 --> 01:53:47,430
No.

3240
01:53:49,450 --> 01:53:50,570
Val can't, right?

3241
01:53:50,870 --> 01:53:51,610
I don't remember.

3242
01:53:51,690 --> 01:53:54,210
Yeah, because I don't play Val.

3243
01:53:54,210 --> 01:53:55,250
So I don't know if Val can.

3244
01:53:56,530 --> 01:53:58,150
I did the phase again.

3245
01:53:59,850 --> 01:54:01,210
Just look at cheeky stream.

3246
01:54:04,310 --> 01:54:04,950
It's a joke, guys!

3247
01:54:06,830 --> 01:54:09,070
It's a joke, but it was a joke.

3248
01:54:09,790 --> 01:54:12,290
Turning off echo cancellation.

3249
01:54:15,450 --> 01:54:16,910
I hear a car, I hear a car.

3250
01:54:17,530 --> 01:54:18,130
Behind us.

3251
01:54:18,370 --> 01:54:22,810
I think they're scanning, right?

3252
01:54:23,110 --> 01:54:23,670
Yeah, yeah.

3253
01:54:23,890 --> 01:54:25,570
But can we see the scan from here?

3254
01:54:25,870 --> 01:54:26,530
Yeah, we can.

3255
01:54:26,630 --> 01:54:27,090
We should be.

3256
01:54:27,530 --> 01:54:28,290
We're not scanning.

3257
01:54:29,330 --> 01:54:30,330
I don't see them.

3258
01:54:31,030 --> 01:54:31,970
I heard a car.

3259
01:54:33,630 --> 01:54:34,990
Did they drive past us?

3260
01:54:35,670 --> 01:54:38,010
I mean, we have a car, but...

3261
01:54:38,010 --> 01:54:38,630
Wait, wait, no, they did!

3262
01:54:38,690 --> 01:54:39,110
They just scanned!

3263
01:54:40,030 --> 01:54:40,870
They're literally in town.

3264
01:54:43,450 --> 01:54:44,590
They're on the car.

3265
01:54:45,070 --> 01:54:46,990
I think they're just gonna wrap around, right?

3266
01:54:47,230 --> 01:54:47,750
Yeah, they should.

3267
01:54:50,290 --> 01:54:50,690
Right?

3268
01:54:51,510 --> 01:54:52,470
We have a car, too.

3269
01:54:54,450 --> 01:54:56,850
Where's the closest beacon right next to you guys?

3270
01:54:57,030 --> 01:54:57,850
Which one?

3271
01:54:57,910 --> 01:54:58,270
I don't know.

3272
01:54:58,290 --> 01:54:59,270
Which one's the beacon?

3273
01:54:59,370 --> 01:55:01,310
Go to solar array.

3274
01:55:02,290 --> 01:55:05,690
Should we take the car to solar or just walk over?

3275
01:55:06,310 --> 01:55:08,230
Nah, just walk over.

3276
01:55:08,510 --> 01:55:09,390
Loot everything.

3277
01:55:10,650 --> 01:55:12,310
There's no one near us because I have a crow.

3278
01:55:12,770 --> 01:55:14,170
Usually there's a crow to shoot.

3279
01:55:14,410 --> 01:55:15,930
They're still behind us, though.

3280
01:55:16,050 --> 01:55:16,590
What the fuck?

3281
01:55:17,010 --> 01:55:17,490
Yeah.

3282
01:55:20,690 --> 01:55:21,870
They're in front of us.

3283
01:55:22,010 --> 01:55:22,470
Can I shoot?

3284
01:55:22,910 --> 01:55:24,070
Get that harvester.

3285
01:55:25,330 --> 01:55:26,890
Are they gonna shot from here?

3286
01:55:28,290 --> 01:55:28,630
Yeah.

3287
01:55:28,830 --> 01:55:32,250
Move left towards the entrance of terminal.

3288
01:55:32,490 --> 01:55:32,790
Okay.

3289
01:55:33,990 --> 01:55:35,530
Are we gonna get that?

3290
01:55:35,690 --> 01:55:36,270
Yeah.

3291
01:55:40,530 --> 01:55:43,350
I think they're just going around driving.

3292
01:55:44,670 --> 01:55:45,250
They're...

3293
01:55:46,470 --> 01:55:47,470
People over there.

3294
01:55:48,310 --> 01:55:49,330
I have ult.

3295
01:55:49,510 --> 01:55:50,470
We need to fly.

3296
01:55:51,450 --> 01:55:54,450
If they start fighting, you can third party them.

3297
01:55:54,650 --> 01:55:57,090
But if they don't commit, we don't have...

3298
01:55:57,090 --> 01:55:57,810
They're not committing.

3299
01:55:57,910 --> 01:55:58,790
There's a team right here.

3300
01:55:58,890 --> 01:56:01,970
There's a team to my right.

3301
01:56:02,310 --> 01:56:04,050
I'm worried I'm getting shot from our back.

3302
01:56:05,050 --> 01:56:08,450
I don't see them.

3303
01:56:11,430 --> 01:56:12,190
Where are they shooting?

3304
01:56:13,790 --> 01:56:14,470
Where are you guys?

3305
01:56:14,710 --> 01:56:16,170
In my discord crowd.

3306
01:56:17,830 --> 01:56:20,630
Dude, I think I'm higher.

3307
01:56:21,030 --> 01:56:21,990
What's going on here?

3308
01:56:23,410 --> 01:56:24,390
Guys, what's going on?

3309
01:56:24,650 --> 01:56:25,750
What's going on, guys?

3310
01:56:26,550 --> 01:56:27,530
Everything's going right.

3311
01:56:29,890 --> 01:56:30,690
We can fly.

3312
01:56:30,810 --> 01:56:31,770
Look at the zone.

3313
01:56:32,030 --> 01:56:32,830
Where's the zone?

3314
01:56:32,950 --> 01:56:34,610
The zone is Growtower's.

3315
01:56:35,370 --> 01:56:35,810
Growtower...

3316
01:56:37,070 --> 01:56:38,050
Here you go.

3317
01:56:38,210 --> 01:56:39,270
Is there a team on Solar?

3318
01:56:40,150 --> 01:56:41,030
Yeah, there is.

3319
01:56:41,330 --> 01:56:44,810
Look at how they're...

3320
01:56:44,810 --> 01:56:45,710
What they're doing.

3321
01:56:47,550 --> 01:56:48,890
They're not scanning the beacon.

3322
01:56:49,070 --> 01:56:50,310
I don't know if they have beacon characters.

3323
01:56:52,510 --> 01:56:53,210
That's the thing.

3324
01:56:54,430 --> 01:56:56,390
I think you guys take Solar from them.

3325
01:56:56,490 --> 01:56:57,510
If they're not there, they're not gonna be able to...

3326
01:56:58,570 --> 01:56:58,970
They're not gonna be able to...

3327
01:56:59,350 --> 01:57:00,650
We don't know who they are, though.

3328
01:57:02,850 --> 01:57:04,910
Walk up from the right and then...

3329
01:57:05,430 --> 01:57:06,030
The right, okay.

3330
01:57:08,390 --> 01:57:09,270
Let's go right side.

3331
01:57:09,650 --> 01:57:10,650
I believe in us.

3332
01:57:13,690 --> 01:57:14,810
Guys, play for that beacon.

3333
01:57:15,010 --> 01:57:16,890
You can even tank a little bit of zone as well.

3334
01:57:17,230 --> 01:57:17,570
Alright.

3335
01:57:19,630 --> 01:57:20,230
One minute.

3336
01:57:22,990 --> 01:57:24,090
Oh my god, they knocked somebody.

3337
01:57:24,930 --> 01:57:25,870
They're in front of us.

3338
01:57:27,530 --> 01:57:27,910
They're scanning.

3339
01:57:28,030 --> 01:57:28,590
They're scanning us.

3340
01:57:28,730 --> 01:57:28,990
We're here.

3341
01:57:29,810 --> 01:57:30,590
Back up.

3342
01:57:30,650 --> 01:57:32,870
They're going in the house.

3343
01:57:32,870 --> 01:57:33,230
Are they running?

3344
01:58:03,480 --> 01:58:06,020
I can't believe we're so lucky.

3345
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:35,640
I can't believe we're so lucky.

3346
01:58:35,640 --> 01:58:36,720
Like the pills in front of you.

3347
01:58:36,860 --> 01:58:36,980
Like the pills in front of you.

3348
01:58:36,980 --> 01:58:38,160
Oh, never mind.

3349
01:58:43,230 --> 01:58:44,310
No, he has teammates.

3350
01:58:47,590 --> 01:58:48,130
No!

3351
01:58:49,730 --> 01:58:51,170
He had teammates!

3352
01:58:51,170 --> 01:58:54,630
Oh, if I was there with you!

3353
01:58:54,830 --> 01:58:57,450
If I was there with you, man!

3354
01:58:58,110 --> 01:58:59,490
If I was there with you, man!

3355
01:58:59,490 --> 01:59:00,070
If I was there with you, man!

3356
01:59:00,070 --> 01:59:02,370
Yeah, you actually fucked them over.

3357
01:59:02,550 --> 01:59:03,650
Yeah, you actually fucked them over.

3358
01:59:06,710 --> 01:59:08,270
You creeped them.

3359
01:59:09,810 --> 01:59:10,530
Bro!

3360
01:59:10,870 --> 01:59:12,090
I can't believe!

3361
01:59:12,730 --> 01:59:16,130
Ever since Tayo crashed, everything went downhill.

3362
01:59:16,370 --> 01:59:16,470
Ever since Tayo crashed, everything went downhill.

3363
01:59:16,470 --> 01:59:17,610
It's a great hit.

3364
01:59:18,370 --> 01:59:20,390
It hit all of us.

3365
01:59:25,690 --> 01:59:26,990
Oh my god.

3366
01:59:27,270 --> 01:59:28,290
Oh my god.

3367
01:59:28,510 --> 01:59:29,750
I can't believe it.

3368
01:59:29,750 --> 01:59:31,830
Bro, you actually used the Peacekeeper like Ash.

3369
01:59:31,990 --> 01:59:32,690
That is crazy.

3370
01:59:33,250 --> 01:59:36,670
Yeah, bro, you should just play Peacekeeper.

3371
01:59:36,670 --> 01:59:37,970
This is hard scope.

3372
01:59:38,370 --> 01:59:39,770
Yeah, the hard scope!

3373
01:59:40,410 --> 01:59:42,030
Ash hard scope.

3374
01:59:44,390 --> 01:59:45,690
Oh my god.

3375
01:59:47,290 --> 01:59:48,410
That's so unlucky.

3376
01:59:48,410 --> 01:59:50,690
That's what you get for trying to fuck over a solo man.

3377
01:59:50,770 --> 01:59:53,410
Nah, that is so fucking unlucky, man.

3378
01:59:53,450 --> 01:59:54,090
I know.

3379
01:59:54,350 --> 01:59:55,870
In duels!

3380
01:59:56,090 --> 01:59:58,570
I've never... I've only had...

3381
01:59:58,570 --> 02:00:02,310
This is the second blue screen I've ever had on Apex.

3382
02:00:02,330 --> 02:00:03,410
It had to happen now.

3383
02:00:03,410 --> 02:00:05,970
It had to happen in the duels.

3384
02:00:05,970 --> 02:00:06,510
Man, it had to happen now.

3385
02:00:06,630 --> 02:00:07,190
Yeah.

3386
02:00:08,910 --> 02:00:10,750
That's actually crazy.

3387
02:00:10,990 --> 02:00:15,290
My second ever blue screen of death.

3388
02:00:16,530 --> 02:00:17,830
My second ever blue screen of death.

3389
02:00:17,830 --> 02:00:18,390
My second ever blue screen of death.

3390
02:00:19,150 --> 02:00:19,850
I'm sorry.

3391
02:00:20,730 --> 02:00:23,110
The next stop is your ease, unfortunately.

3392
02:00:24,210 --> 02:00:27,290
Yeah, your ease already got hit with the fucking Discord.

3393
02:00:27,770 --> 02:00:27,830
Wait, stop.

3394
02:00:28,150 --> 02:00:28,950
Not me.

3395
02:00:28,970 --> 02:00:30,110
Oh yeah, the Discord bullshit.

3396
02:00:30,130 --> 02:00:30,510
Yeah, yeah.

3397
02:00:30,610 --> 02:00:32,130
What is that, bro?

3398
02:00:32,350 --> 02:00:33,030
What is that?

3399
02:00:33,630 --> 02:00:35,470
What's up Discord bugs, guys?

3400
02:00:37,150 --> 02:00:38,070
What's going on here?

3401
02:00:39,730 --> 02:00:41,270
We have three more games.

3402
02:00:41,370 --> 02:00:43,690
It's okay, we can bring it back in the next three games.

3403
02:00:44,590 --> 02:00:45,310
I believe.

3404
02:00:45,390 --> 02:00:46,230
Wait, there's three more games?

3405
02:00:46,270 --> 02:00:46,910
I wanna go for ten.

3406
02:00:46,910 --> 02:00:47,190
Yeah, yeah.

3407
02:00:48,470 --> 02:00:49,490
No, two more games.

3408
02:00:49,730 --> 02:00:50,530
Yeah, there's two more games.

3409
02:00:50,590 --> 02:00:51,690
Two more trios.

3410
02:00:53,270 --> 02:00:53,750
Bro.

3411
02:00:53,750 --> 02:00:54,230
Bro.

3412
02:00:54,350 --> 02:00:55,590
Redo the duels match.

3413
02:00:55,710 --> 02:00:56,210
I crashed.

3414
02:00:56,730 --> 02:00:57,210
Restart.

3415
02:00:57,210 --> 02:00:58,030
Yeah, redo please.

3416
02:00:58,070 --> 02:00:58,650
Thank you.

3417
02:01:01,270 --> 02:01:03,530
Wait, this game is actually like...

3418
02:01:03,530 --> 02:01:04,450
Oh my god.

3419
02:01:04,890 --> 02:01:08,710
This game really wanted Taya to have more damage.

3420
02:01:09,690 --> 02:01:10,170
Yeah.

3421
02:01:10,170 --> 02:01:11,330
How much damage did I have?

3422
02:01:15,970 --> 02:01:18,370
This game wanted him to have a higher damage.

3423
02:01:18,390 --> 02:01:21,350
So they fucking sent out the assassins on me.

3424
02:01:22,470 --> 02:01:23,230
They're average, so they fucking sent out the assassins on me.

3425
02:01:24,590 --> 02:01:27,230
In the middle of the road tape too.

3426
02:01:29,810 --> 02:01:31,710
I was like, what the fuck?

3427
02:01:32,170 --> 02:01:33,610
It's so messed up.

3428
02:01:34,770 --> 02:01:36,810
Maybe we're just meant to be Overwatch players.

3429
02:01:37,270 --> 02:01:37,650
Yeah.

3430
02:01:38,130 --> 02:01:40,510
This game is just telling us we suck ass.

3431
02:01:41,670 --> 02:01:42,230
Yeah.

3432
02:01:42,230 --> 02:01:43,690
Yeah, like...

3433
02:01:44,330 --> 02:01:46,170
Wait, Yuris, what's your Overwatch rank?

3434
02:01:48,410 --> 02:01:49,670
I got point to gold.

3435
02:01:49,950 --> 02:01:50,470
I got point to gold.

3436
02:01:50,470 --> 02:01:50,930
You got gold?

3437
02:01:51,450 --> 02:01:52,330
My first rank.

3438
02:01:52,530 --> 02:01:53,010
Yeah.

3439
02:01:53,250 --> 02:01:54,830
You're gold?

3440
02:01:57,610 --> 02:01:59,390
That shit was a scam, bro.

3441
02:02:00,650 --> 02:02:01,850
Bro, what do you mean?

3442
02:02:04,110 --> 02:02:05,450
You get 10 matches.

3443
02:02:05,790 --> 02:02:07,310
My rank got scammed.

3444
02:02:07,690 --> 02:02:10,050
You get 10 matches to rank up.

3445
02:02:10,050 --> 02:02:11,670
What are you, looting placements?

3446
02:02:14,030 --> 02:02:15,450
Bro, it's so cute.

3447
02:02:15,510 --> 02:02:16,150
Yeah, I got point to gold.

3448
02:02:16,170 --> 02:02:17,450
I got point to gold after my placement.

3449
02:02:17,570 --> 02:02:18,330
Wait, what's your rank now?

3450
02:02:18,330 --> 02:02:19,310
I did like 7-3.

3451
02:02:19,450 --> 02:02:21,810
And all those games, I did good.

3452
02:02:21,990 --> 02:02:23,950
It wasn't like I trolled one of the games.

3453
02:02:24,070 --> 02:02:25,610
It's just I had bad teammates.

3454
02:02:26,030 --> 02:02:27,370
Oh, the Overwatch special.

3455
02:02:27,530 --> 02:02:28,170
Yeah, yeah.

3456
02:02:29,970 --> 02:02:31,850
I just had bad...

3457
02:02:31,850 --> 02:02:33,730
That sounds like a typical DPS main.

3458
02:02:34,210 --> 02:02:35,510
Yeah, I did it.

3459
02:02:35,510 --> 02:02:37,410
I am indeed a DPS main.

3460
02:02:37,470 --> 02:02:39,030
I just can't.

3461
02:02:40,190 --> 02:02:41,670
What more can I do?

3462
02:02:41,890 --> 02:02:42,610
What's that rank?

3463
02:02:42,790 --> 02:02:43,930
What's that crazy game?

3464
02:02:43,930 --> 02:02:46,110
I got trolled once by a healer.

3465
02:02:47,070 --> 02:02:47,850
Oh my god.

3466
02:02:47,850 --> 02:02:49,370
You're in elo hell, bro.

3467
02:02:49,530 --> 02:02:50,430
It's not you.

3468
02:02:50,490 --> 02:02:51,250
It's your teammates.

3469
02:02:51,390 --> 02:02:52,730
That's why you're stuck in elo hell.

3470
02:02:55,090 --> 02:02:57,130
But like, I actually was like...

3471
02:02:57,130 --> 02:02:58,850
Actually, I'm like...

3472
02:02:59,610 --> 02:03:00,270
I like...

3473
02:03:00,270 --> 02:03:04,130
I don't think I should be in gold.

3474
02:03:04,290 --> 02:03:04,530
You know?

3475
02:03:04,570 --> 02:03:05,970
Like, I platinum at least.

3476
02:03:06,010 --> 02:03:06,890
At the very least.

3477
02:03:07,030 --> 02:03:09,190
Did you rank up the play or are you still in gold?

3478
02:03:10,590 --> 02:03:13,170
I stopped after I got trolled by a healer.

3479
02:03:13,210 --> 02:03:13,910
I like... yeah.

3480
02:03:13,930 --> 02:03:14,370
Fuck this.

3481
02:03:14,370 --> 02:03:15,610
I'm not playing this game anymore.

3482
02:03:18,210 --> 02:03:19,250
I actually...

3483
02:03:19,250 --> 02:03:22,870
I actually raged... went to Valorant and raged in Valorant.

3484
02:03:23,170 --> 02:03:23,690
No.

3485
02:03:24,150 --> 02:03:26,230
That's called you should stop streaming.

3486
02:03:26,790 --> 02:03:27,670
Because if you know...

3487
02:03:27,670 --> 02:03:32,510
If you had to go to Valorant after rage quitting Overwatch, that's when you know you need to stop.

3488
02:03:34,910 --> 02:03:36,310
Valorant is not better.

3489
02:03:39,570 --> 02:03:40,810
Oh my god.

3490
02:03:40,910 --> 02:03:41,470
It's okay.

3491
02:03:41,470 --> 02:03:43,150
Gold is like the average...

3492
02:03:43,150 --> 02:03:43,950
average player.

3493
02:03:44,210 --> 02:03:44,810
You're average.

3494
02:03:45,810 --> 02:03:46,970
That's the average rage.

3495
02:03:48,030 --> 02:03:48,870
I'm average.

3496
02:03:49,310 --> 02:03:50,570
I just need a duo.

3497
02:03:50,730 --> 02:03:51,070
You know?

3498
02:03:51,170 --> 02:03:53,610
I need like... I need someone to rage with me.

3499
02:03:53,690 --> 02:03:54,790
I need someone to like...

3500
02:03:54,790 --> 02:04:00,190
I need someone to be there.

3501
02:04:00,410 --> 02:04:01,570
You need...

3502
02:04:01,570 --> 02:04:01,750
No.

3503
02:04:01,770 --> 02:04:03,270
You need a mercy pocket.

3504
02:04:03,430 --> 02:04:04,390
That's what you need.

3505
02:04:05,910 --> 02:04:08,270
Bro, I actually... I think I have a mercy pocket.

3506
02:04:08,430 --> 02:04:09,890
I'm about to duo with a friend.

3507
02:04:10,570 --> 02:04:11,850
We're about to roll...

3508
02:04:11,850 --> 02:04:13,190
We're about to get the diamond.

3509
02:04:14,270 --> 02:04:16,130
You need the mercy pocket.

3510
02:04:17,790 --> 02:04:18,290
That's it.

3511
02:04:18,390 --> 02:04:18,750
That's it.

3512
02:04:18,790 --> 02:04:19,770
The healer pocket.

3513
02:04:19,950 --> 02:04:21,070
That's the way.

3514
02:04:22,390 --> 02:04:23,510
Oh my god.

3515
02:04:23,530 --> 02:04:23,910
This team...

3516
02:04:23,910 --> 02:04:24,710
Oh, this team.

3517
02:04:24,770 --> 02:04:25,510
Holy shit.

3518
02:04:25,710 --> 02:04:26,310
Oh my god.

3519
02:04:26,330 --> 02:04:27,130
That's the team that killed me.

3520
02:04:27,410 --> 02:04:28,410
That's the team that killed you?

3521
02:04:28,650 --> 02:04:29,130
No.

3522
02:04:29,330 --> 02:04:29,950
Because they died.

3523
02:04:30,350 --> 02:04:32,990
It's the team that killed the people that killed me.

3524
02:04:34,410 --> 02:04:36,290
That makes me the best.

3525
02:04:36,390 --> 02:04:36,550
Yeah.

3526
02:04:36,550 --> 02:04:37,510
That makes you the best.

3527
02:04:38,910 --> 02:04:39,870
The second...

3528
02:04:39,890 --> 02:04:40,130
I think I'm the best.

3529
02:04:40,490 --> 02:04:41,310
Who is this team?

3530
02:04:42,970 --> 02:04:46,490
Someone in my chat was like, every gold player say they belong in diamond.

3531
02:04:49,070 --> 02:04:51,310
Dude, my gym coach says the same shit.

3532
02:04:51,530 --> 02:04:54,470
I'm in gold, but I deserve diamond, bro.

3533
02:04:54,790 --> 02:04:56,370
My teammates.

3534
02:04:59,430 --> 02:05:02,430
The moment you get that mercy pocket, you go up.

3535
02:05:04,270 --> 02:05:04,730
Yeah.

3536
02:05:04,930 --> 02:05:09,870
I feel like there's actually moments where you cannot do... like you can't do more.

3537
02:05:09,890 --> 02:05:11,330
As a solo though.

3538
02:05:11,550 --> 02:05:13,330
Well, to be fair, I think like Overwatch...

3539
02:05:14,370 --> 02:05:15,710
Overwatch has changed.

3540
02:05:15,950 --> 02:05:17,430
Because in the past, you can...

3541
02:05:17,430 --> 02:05:19,090
You can solo carry a team.

3542
02:05:19,150 --> 02:05:20,870
In the past when there was like six players.

3543
02:05:21,290 --> 02:05:26,950
Now like... Now the way they balanced in Overwatch 2, I feel like it's harder to solo carry.

3544
02:05:27,290 --> 02:05:29,550
If you're like a fucking god tier DPS.

3545
02:05:30,870 --> 02:05:31,530
Yeah, it's...

3546
02:05:31,530 --> 02:05:32,190
You just die.

3547
02:05:32,530 --> 02:05:32,830
Yeah.

3548
02:05:33,130 --> 02:05:35,110
Especially if you're a DPS player.

3549
02:05:35,270 --> 02:05:37,530
If you really want to climb, being a tank...

3550
02:05:37,530 --> 02:05:39,530
Okay, but tank is... Playing tank is fucking miserable.

3551
02:05:39,870 --> 02:05:40,810
But like...

3552
02:05:41,310 --> 02:05:43,330
No one really enjoys playing tank.

3553
02:05:43,590 --> 02:05:47,250
But like, tank is like the most overpowered character now in Overwatch.

3554
02:05:48,610 --> 02:05:50,790
I think DPS got like hella nerfed.

3555
02:05:51,890 --> 02:05:57,330
I always get fucking rolled by that guy that has the little punching...

3556
02:05:57,330 --> 02:05:58,310
The guy that punches.

3557
02:05:58,670 --> 02:05:59,210
Doomfist?

3558
02:05:59,530 --> 02:06:00,630
Yeah, Doomfist.

3559
02:06:00,870 --> 02:06:03,030
I always get fucking fisted by that guy, bro.

3560
02:06:03,030 --> 02:06:03,590
I hate him.

3561
02:06:03,710 --> 02:06:04,190
Wait, what?

3562
02:06:04,570 --> 02:06:05,230
Wait, what?

3563
02:06:09,150 --> 02:06:10,570
Yeah, you got fisted.

3564
02:06:10,750 --> 02:06:11,590
Several times.

3565
02:06:12,030 --> 02:06:13,530
We have a 10 minute interval.

3566
02:06:13,630 --> 02:06:15,350
I'm gonna go to a fucking lockdown.

3567
02:06:15,690 --> 02:06:16,810
You're gonna go to lockdown?

3568
02:06:17,050 --> 02:06:17,970
What the fuck does that mean?

3569
02:06:19,050 --> 02:06:20,050
Wait, let's lockdown.

3570
02:06:20,370 --> 02:06:21,630
Let's lockdown together.

3571
02:06:22,090 --> 02:06:26,730
I need to fucking roll someone right now or I'm about to lose it.

3572
02:06:27,030 --> 02:06:28,590
Oh my god, wait, yeah, yeah, that's all.

3573
02:06:29,290 --> 02:06:31,110
Wait, you guys don't have me at it?

3574
02:06:31,390 --> 02:06:31,850
Okay.

3575
02:06:33,850 --> 02:06:35,290
I leave custom mesh.

3576
02:06:35,330 --> 02:06:35,670
I'm here.

3577
02:06:35,850 --> 02:06:36,590
Is this just Dokkaebird?

3578
02:06:36,790 --> 02:06:36,970
Yeah.

3579
02:06:37,530 --> 02:06:37,890
I'm here now.

3580
02:06:37,890 --> 02:06:37,990
Oh my god.

3581
02:06:38,830 --> 02:06:39,770
What is lockdown?

3582
02:06:39,910 --> 02:06:40,510
Oh, what the fuck?

3583
02:06:40,550 --> 02:06:41,210
I can't even play.

3584
02:06:41,470 --> 02:06:41,950
Wait, what?

3585
02:06:42,130 --> 02:06:42,950
Oh, the curse!

3586
02:06:43,450 --> 02:06:44,650
The curse is real!

3587
02:06:45,090 --> 02:06:46,970
The curse is the next step.

3588
02:06:46,970 --> 02:06:47,930
She's level one.

3589
02:06:48,070 --> 02:06:49,310
She's like level one.

3590
02:06:49,310 --> 02:06:49,630
What do you mean?

3591
02:06:49,730 --> 02:06:50,850
I'm 107.

3592
02:06:51,930 --> 02:06:52,370
Yeah.

3593
02:06:52,610 --> 02:06:54,070
I think it's you.

3594
02:06:55,850 --> 02:06:57,090
Wait, is it my fault?

3595
02:06:57,290 --> 02:06:57,790
Yeah, it's you.

3596
02:06:57,870 --> 02:06:58,890
Go to firing range.

3597
02:06:59,250 --> 02:06:59,690
Okay.

3598
02:07:00,650 --> 02:07:01,090
Yeah.

3599
02:07:03,690 --> 02:07:04,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3600
02:07:06,150 --> 02:07:07,050
We're gonna go in?

3601
02:07:07,530 --> 02:07:08,710
We have to leave because it resets it.

3602
02:07:09,490 --> 02:07:09,910
Okay.

3603
02:07:10,170 --> 02:07:12,990
Yeah, it's a little LGS strat there.

3604
02:07:14,970 --> 02:07:18,890
I'm not too versed in the Apex Apex phenomenon.

3605
02:07:19,270 --> 02:07:22,850
Yeah, we've learned to adapt to the bugs.

3606
02:07:23,430 --> 02:07:24,690
It's not bugs anymore, it's features.

3607
02:07:24,690 --> 02:07:27,350
It's like how in Overwatch you turn on V-Sync on and off.

3608
02:07:28,490 --> 02:07:29,130
That's the equivalent.

3609
02:07:29,130 --> 02:07:30,570
I don't even think that shit worked.

3610
02:07:30,690 --> 02:07:32,230
Dude, punch boosting is definitely back.

3611
02:07:32,290 --> 02:07:32,790
Holy shit.

3612
02:07:32,870 --> 02:07:33,890
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's back.

3613
02:07:34,050 --> 02:07:38,410
Oh man, like you know how were you- you played Overwatch since launch, right Tayo?

3614
02:07:38,810 --> 02:07:39,290
Yeah.

3615
02:07:39,470 --> 02:07:43,570
Yeah, remember that phase where you had to delete your friends for more FPS?

3616
02:07:44,030 --> 02:07:44,590
You remember that?

3617
02:07:44,930 --> 02:07:46,510
Oh yeah, that was a thing.

3618
02:07:46,630 --> 02:07:48,230
That shit was so funny.

3619
02:07:48,490 --> 02:07:50,770
You don't have too many friends in your friends list.

3620
02:07:50,930 --> 02:07:59,070
Yeah, yeah, you have to like keep your friends list to like one to two pages because you can get more friends so people have to do that in Overwatch.

3621
02:07:59,330 --> 02:08:01,430
It's like yeah, you have too many friends, you're getting fucking nerfed.

3622
02:08:01,790 --> 02:08:07,230
Yeah, you're like are you a good enough friend to like to for the frames?

3623
02:08:09,430 --> 02:08:09,830
Okay.

3624
02:08:09,830 --> 02:08:11,190
That shit was so dumb.

3625
02:08:11,310 --> 02:08:12,550
Yeah, yeah, we go back to lobby.

3626
02:08:13,330 --> 02:08:14,890
And then Yuris crashes, right?

3627
02:08:14,950 --> 02:08:15,730
That's the whole plan.

3628
02:08:15,890 --> 02:08:17,390
Yeah, yeah, he's gonna crash in the next game.

3629
02:08:17,830 --> 02:08:18,790
Wait, not trios.

3630
02:08:19,090 --> 02:08:19,490
Lockdown.

3631
02:08:20,090 --> 02:08:20,490
Okay.

3632
02:08:20,690 --> 02:08:22,270
Wait, he's still- oh, okay, it's good.

3633
02:08:22,390 --> 02:08:23,070
Yeah, it's good now.

3634
02:08:23,190 --> 02:08:24,090
Oh my god, I thought it was some bug.

3635
02:08:26,530 --> 02:08:28,970
Yeah, frames were for friends, 100%.

3636
02:08:33,860 --> 02:08:43,440
To be fair, even if like, you know, Overwatch 2 has gone through a lot of things, the best thing about Overwatch is the fact that you literally play any server and you're fine.

3637
02:08:43,960 --> 02:08:46,720
The netcode for this fucking game is like insane.

3638
02:08:49,180 --> 02:08:49,620
True, true.

3639
02:08:49,620 --> 02:08:50,780
It's one good thing, I guess.

3640
02:08:50,980 --> 02:08:51,200
Yeah.

3641
02:08:53,160 --> 02:08:57,160
Out of the many bad- Out of the many bad truths.

3642
02:08:57,160 --> 02:08:59,920
But then again, any game- no game is perfect, honestly.

3643
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:01,320
Yeah, yeah.

3644
02:09:02,500 --> 02:09:02,940
100%.

3645
02:09:02,940 --> 02:09:04,900
I just wish there would be a new FPS game.

3646
02:09:05,040 --> 02:09:06,060
I've been like, I don't know.

3647
02:09:06,080 --> 02:09:10,960
There's like this- I don't know if you guys heard about the one that's from like RuneScape devs.

3648
02:09:10,960 --> 02:09:15,780
I know, it's weird that RuneScape devs are making an FPS game, but- Wait, what?

3649
02:09:17,500 --> 02:09:19,820
There was a new one that beta opened.

3650
02:09:20,060 --> 02:09:20,940
Oh, The Ascendant!

3651
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:21,900
Have you guys heard about it?

3652
02:09:22,020 --> 02:09:22,700
The Ascendant?

3653
02:09:22,980 --> 02:09:23,420
Ascendant?

3654
02:09:23,480 --> 02:09:23,880
Yeah.

3655
02:09:23,960 --> 02:09:24,880
No, let me Google it.

3656
02:09:25,160 --> 02:09:25,600
Yeah.

3657
02:09:25,740 --> 02:09:29,940
Apparently like closed beta is coming out like tomorrow or something, or today.

3658
02:09:30,940 --> 02:09:31,820
The Ascendant?

3659
02:09:31,820 --> 02:09:32,500
The Ascendant FPS?

3660
02:09:33,060 --> 02:09:33,340
Yeah.

3661
02:09:33,340 --> 02:09:34,900
Have you guys heard about that game?

3662
02:09:36,760 --> 02:09:37,160
Infinity?

3663
02:09:37,860 --> 02:09:38,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3664
02:09:39,080 --> 02:09:41,180
Apparently it's by some fucking RuneScape dev.

3665
02:09:43,040 --> 02:09:46,340
It's like Apex Movement with like- Yeah, it looks like Apex.

3666
02:09:46,720 --> 02:09:48,940
Yeah, it's like Apex Movement with something else.

3667
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:49,520
I don't remember.

3668
02:09:52,380 --> 02:09:53,520
I saw it on Twitter.

3669
02:09:53,640 --> 02:09:54,880
It was like trending on Twitter.

3670
02:09:54,900 --> 02:09:55,760
And I was like, oh my god.

3671
02:09:56,400 --> 02:09:59,080
This game's gonna die in like two weeks, but oh my god.

3672
02:10:00,460 --> 02:10:01,780
Just like the finals.

3673
02:10:02,140 --> 02:10:02,540
Just like the finals.

3674
02:10:05,360 --> 02:10:06,140
Oh my god.

3675
02:10:06,280 --> 02:10:08,200
I wanna kill people right now.

3676
02:10:09,020 --> 02:10:09,920
What's Lockdown?

3677
02:10:10,160 --> 02:10:11,180
What game mode is this?

3678
02:10:11,580 --> 02:10:12,840
I don't think I've played Lockdown.

3679
02:10:14,260 --> 02:10:14,920
No clue.

3680
02:10:19,100 --> 02:10:21,720
Who's that one last player that's not loading in?

3681
02:10:22,200 --> 02:10:22,700
Who's that one last player that's not loading in?

3682
02:10:24,480 --> 02:10:26,820
Do I need to buy someone an SSD right now?

3683
02:10:27,180 --> 02:10:27,220
Do I need to buy someone an SSD right now?

3684
02:10:27,220 --> 02:10:27,340
Yeah!

3685
02:10:29,320 --> 02:10:31,020
Give me your address, boy!

3686
02:10:31,640 --> 02:10:33,650
Let me send you a terabyte SSD.

3687
02:10:37,700 --> 02:10:38,340
Troll.

3688
02:10:40,680 --> 02:10:43,080
Oh, what's your rank right now, Tayo?

3689
02:10:43,720 --> 02:10:44,520
Right now?

3690
02:10:44,720 --> 02:10:46,440
Like Grand Master something.

3691
02:10:46,860 --> 02:10:47,920
One- or...

3692
02:10:47,920 --> 02:10:50,780
Not even that new rank they made?

3693
02:10:50,860 --> 02:10:51,900
What's that new rank they made?

3694
02:10:51,900 --> 02:10:54,420
There's like 10 people in that rank.

3695
02:10:54,580 --> 02:10:57,940
Like- there's 10 people in champion?

3696
02:10:58,680 --> 02:11:02,480
It's legit like 15 people per region per role.

3697
02:11:02,800 --> 02:11:03,840
Wait, really?

3698
02:11:05,480 --> 02:11:09,200
This is like, not top 500, it's like a tier above... a tier...

3699
02:11:09,200 --> 02:11:12,520
No, like, top 500 is like from Masters 1.

3700
02:11:14,080 --> 02:11:14,640
Ohhhhhhhhhh!

3701
02:11:15,240 --> 02:11:19,660
Bro, that means champion is like fucking top 10, or top 15.

3702
02:11:19,680 --> 02:11:23,920
Yeah, it's like... it's really like... I don't know, I'm never getting there.

3703
02:11:24,720 --> 02:11:26,020
I'm never getting there.

3704
02:11:26,320 --> 02:11:27,740
Bro, what the fuck?

3705
02:11:28,240 --> 02:11:33,740
I did not realize that fucking... that's like top 10.

3706
02:11:33,740 --> 02:11:34,480
That's hella hard.

3707
02:11:34,940 --> 02:11:36,820
You need a 3 stack or some shit.

3708
02:11:38,360 --> 02:11:41,900
Yeah, at 3 AM when there's no one playing it, you just kill all the Masters.

3709
02:11:43,300 --> 02:11:45,600
The Overwatch League special.

3710
02:11:45,880 --> 02:11:46,680
Oh shit, I'm getting rolled.

3711
02:11:49,180 --> 02:11:50,380
I rolled one guy.

3712
02:11:50,520 --> 02:11:52,480
I didn't shoot anything yet.

3713
02:11:53,360 --> 02:11:54,480
I don't know where people are.

3714
02:11:55,600 --> 02:11:56,400
What the fuck?

3715
02:11:56,600 --> 02:11:57,440
That's what Bloodhounds... woah.

3716
02:11:59,820 --> 02:12:01,200
Oh, he's above me!

3717
02:12:01,560 --> 02:12:02,420
Guys, I'm feeding.

3718
02:12:03,740 --> 02:12:04,160
Oh shit.

3719
02:12:04,500 --> 02:12:04,980
I'm feeding.

3720
02:12:08,020 --> 02:12:09,760
They're holding the spot.

3721
02:12:10,300 --> 02:12:11,800
Yeah, I think you gotta go to the spot.

3722
02:12:12,380 --> 02:12:13,280
The spot?

3723
02:12:13,480 --> 02:12:14,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3724
02:12:14,500 --> 02:12:18,780
I'm so... ohhhh, like do you like... oh, it's like control, basically.

3725
02:12:19,580 --> 02:12:21,620
Yeah, there's... there's a guy above you.

3726
02:12:22,260 --> 02:12:23,400
Wait, where did the guy go?

3727
02:12:24,200 --> 02:12:24,760
The fuck?

3728
02:12:24,980 --> 02:12:25,900
Right below us.

3729
02:12:26,560 --> 02:12:28,520
Alright guys, we're gonna take her.

3730
02:12:33,020 --> 02:12:33,640
Underneath me.

3731
02:12:33,960 --> 02:12:34,440
Dead.

3732
02:12:35,300 --> 02:12:36,620
I just fucking fell.

3733
02:12:36,740 --> 02:12:38,720
It's fine, I'm fucking falling before you.

3734
02:12:38,780 --> 02:12:40,140
Oh, that's not you.

3735
02:12:40,300 --> 02:12:40,820
Okay.

3736
02:12:40,980 --> 02:12:41,320
Nice.

3737
02:12:41,500 --> 02:12:42,120
I don't care.

3738
02:12:42,580 --> 02:12:43,280
I'm healing.

3739
02:12:44,020 --> 02:12:45,380
They literally have like infinite bubbles.

3740
02:12:45,380 --> 02:12:47,900
They literally have like infinite bubbles.

3741
02:12:48,240 --> 02:12:48,920
Go in!

3742
02:12:49,660 --> 02:12:50,840
Go, go, go, go!

3743
02:12:50,960 --> 02:12:51,700
I'm pushing left.

3744
02:12:52,060 --> 02:12:53,500
I'm scanning, I'm scanning!

3745
02:12:54,840 --> 02:12:55,660
I got one!

3746
02:12:56,840 --> 02:12:57,720
I cracked two.

3747
02:12:57,860 --> 02:12:59,640
I got two!

3748
02:13:00,200 --> 02:13:01,880
Woah, that's another...

3749
02:13:02,840 --> 02:13:03,740
I got three!

3750
02:13:04,440 --> 02:13:04,960
Nice!

3751
02:13:06,260 --> 02:13:07,180
I can't get more!

3752
02:13:09,700 --> 02:13:10,600
I cracked two!

3753
02:13:10,900 --> 02:13:11,020
I cracked two!

3754
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:15,740
I did everything I can.

3755
02:13:15,880 --> 02:13:16,640
What the fuck?

3756
02:13:16,760 --> 02:13:18,020
Oh, they have replay now.

3757
02:13:18,100 --> 02:13:19,540
There's just like four parties now.

3758
02:13:20,740 --> 02:13:22,260
Yo, we're getting fucking...

3759
02:13:23,020 --> 02:13:23,820
We're bears.

3760
02:13:23,880 --> 02:13:24,600
Okay, we're second.

3761
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:26,420
Wait, wait, wait, go B, go B, go B.

3762
02:13:26,500 --> 02:13:26,680
Go B?

3763
02:13:28,240 --> 02:13:29,240
It's neutral, it's neutral.

3764
02:13:30,500 --> 02:13:31,300
I'm heading over.

3765
02:13:31,300 --> 02:13:34,060
This is like some... wait, we're playing Overwatch right now.

3766
02:13:34,180 --> 02:13:35,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're controlling the point.

3767
02:13:36,260 --> 02:13:38,400
I'm literally running past as many people.

3768
02:13:38,820 --> 02:13:39,260
I'm literally running past as many people.

3769
02:13:39,260 --> 02:13:39,800
I'm... ooh!

3770
02:13:41,660 --> 02:13:42,600
What the fuck?

3771
02:13:42,840 --> 02:13:44,340
Hello, he's on my door.

3772
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:46,180
Oh, he burned me!

3773
02:13:47,640 --> 02:13:49,280
I'm so ass-cheeked.

3774
02:13:50,100 --> 02:13:51,180
Okay, I'm healing.

3775
02:13:52,320 --> 02:13:53,800
Don't worry, they're not gonna push, right?

3776
02:13:54,180 --> 02:13:54,200
Don't worry, they're not gonna push, right?

3777
02:13:55,100 --> 02:13:55,540
Outside?

3778
02:13:55,840 --> 02:13:56,560
Wait, in front of me.

3779
02:13:56,660 --> 02:13:57,340
No audio!

3780
02:13:58,480 --> 02:13:59,160
Oh god.

3781
02:13:59,640 --> 02:14:00,600
He's climbing up on you!

3782
02:14:00,600 --> 02:14:01,280
He's climbing up on you!

3783
02:14:01,300 --> 02:14:01,380
He's climbing up on you!

3784
02:14:03,500 --> 02:14:05,400
You can climb that?!

3785
02:14:06,260 --> 02:14:07,200
What the fuck?

3786
02:14:09,260 --> 02:14:10,800
There's a flipper in the roof!

3787
02:14:11,160 --> 02:14:11,820
Hopi, Hopi!

3788
02:14:12,080 --> 02:14:12,520
No!

3789
02:14:13,280 --> 02:14:14,820
I had to fucking...

3790
02:14:14,820 --> 02:14:16,060
charge it up!

3791
02:14:17,020 --> 02:14:18,620
Bro, when did they add a replay?

3792
02:14:19,340 --> 02:14:20,520
Did you just add it today?

3793
02:14:20,980 --> 02:14:22,080
Or like, not on lockdown?

3794
02:14:22,920 --> 02:14:24,660
Nah, I think it's for this game mode, maybe.

3795
02:14:24,880 --> 02:14:26,640
Oh, they're testing it out, it must be.

3796
02:14:26,720 --> 02:14:30,240
Oh my god, dude, I can't beat the dude with the prowler.

3797
02:14:30,440 --> 02:14:31,280
Oh my god, dude, I can't beat the dude with the prowler.

3798
02:14:31,980 --> 02:14:33,120
I'm heading over to neutral.

3799
02:14:34,420 --> 02:14:35,340
I'm heading over to B.

3800
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:37,460
I'm in.

3801
02:14:37,600 --> 02:14:39,100
Are you not supposed to scope for...

3802
02:14:40,100 --> 02:14:40,900
the prowler?

3803
02:14:41,140 --> 02:14:41,960
The prowler?

3804
02:14:42,200 --> 02:14:43,940
You can, but not really.

3805
02:14:44,560 --> 02:14:44,960
Bruh.

3806
02:14:45,020 --> 02:14:45,820
I normally don't.

3807
02:14:45,820 --> 02:14:46,420
Oh my god.

3808
02:14:46,440 --> 02:14:47,920
I hate this guy.

3809
02:14:49,620 --> 02:14:51,140
Hate is a strong word, man.

3810
02:14:52,880 --> 02:14:54,300
I'm going to dokey.

3811
02:14:54,500 --> 02:14:55,860
There's people on me, there's people on me.

3812
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:56,600
I'm going to B.

3813
02:14:57,020 --> 02:14:57,940
Let's meet up in B.

3814
02:14:59,740 --> 02:15:01,420
Oh, there's two people on me.

3815
02:15:01,760 --> 02:15:02,900
There's no one to scope for.

3816
02:15:03,540 --> 02:15:05,080
Oh no, my wingman.

3817
02:15:05,740 --> 02:15:06,700
They have my wingy.

3818
02:15:07,640 --> 02:15:08,980
What the fuck was this guy?

3819
02:15:12,160 --> 02:15:12,520
Okay.

3820
02:15:13,200 --> 02:15:13,820
I'm dead.

3821
02:15:13,880 --> 02:15:14,500
Let's go B.

3822
02:15:14,500 --> 02:15:15,140
It's okay, I'm scanning.

3823
02:15:16,800 --> 02:15:18,100
I realize we're so far.

3824
02:15:18,240 --> 02:15:19,780
Yeah, yeah, B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B.

3825
02:15:19,780 --> 02:15:20,060
I'm dead.

3826
02:15:20,540 --> 02:15:23,140
What the f- I'm getting teamed on by five teams.

3827
02:15:23,500 --> 02:15:24,640
You get teamed?

3828
02:15:25,820 --> 02:15:27,420
Oh my god, what the fuck?

3829
02:15:27,940 --> 02:15:28,380
I got one.

3830
02:15:29,900 --> 02:15:31,040
Okay, they're all in there.

3831
02:15:31,300 --> 02:15:32,200
The backup's here.

3832
02:15:32,980 --> 02:15:34,300
Back up here, back up here.

3833
02:15:35,700 --> 02:15:36,680
We need the backup.

3834
02:15:36,780 --> 02:15:39,140
That's us, let's get shot in the back.

3835
02:15:41,160 --> 02:15:42,520
Wait, I'm pushing from the left.

3836
02:15:43,280 --> 02:15:44,260
I'm flanking, I'm flanking.

3837
02:15:44,260 --> 02:15:45,120
Yeah, me too, me too, me too.

3838
02:15:46,080 --> 02:15:46,440
Yeah.

3839
02:15:47,300 --> 02:15:48,100
Oh my god.

3840
02:15:50,480 --> 02:15:51,360
Wait, he's low.

3841
02:15:51,720 --> 02:15:52,380
Flash on me, dead.

3842
02:15:52,800 --> 02:15:53,680
I'm going to buy in the corner.

3843
02:15:56,260 --> 02:15:56,980
Ouch, ouch.

3844
02:16:00,120 --> 02:16:00,440
I'm going to buy in the corner.

3845
02:16:00,440 --> 02:16:01,520
Oh, I had to make sure that...

3846
02:16:01,520 --> 02:16:02,500
What is happening to that guy?

3847
02:16:04,260 --> 02:16:05,580
That blob has started it.

3848
02:16:06,380 --> 02:16:07,360
I'm coming over, I'm coming over.

3849
02:16:08,700 --> 02:16:09,740
I'm sweaty as fuck.

3850
02:16:10,240 --> 02:16:10,880
Dead bitch.

3851
02:16:11,260 --> 02:16:11,740
You're dead.

3852
02:16:12,420 --> 02:16:13,860
They're coming in, they're coming in, they're coming in.

3853
02:16:14,840 --> 02:16:15,480
One guy on me.

3854
02:16:16,680 --> 02:16:17,420
Did we get it?

3855
02:16:17,600 --> 02:16:18,620
There's so many guys.

3856
02:16:19,840 --> 02:16:20,660
Oh my god, it's neutral.

3857
02:16:20,940 --> 02:16:21,900
I got it, I got it.

3858
02:16:22,020 --> 02:16:22,480
You got it?

3859
02:16:22,520 --> 02:16:23,780
Okay, I'm covering, I'm covering.

3860
02:16:23,880 --> 02:16:24,640
There's people on the bubble.

3861
02:16:24,640 --> 02:16:25,980
I'm holding it, I'm holding it.

3862
02:16:28,360 --> 02:16:28,900
I'm here.

3863
02:16:29,200 --> 02:16:30,060
He's behind you.

3864
02:16:33,380 --> 02:16:33,800
Nice.

3865
02:16:34,020 --> 02:16:34,560
Got one.

3866
02:16:34,720 --> 02:16:35,060
Thank you.

3867
02:16:36,960 --> 02:16:37,800
On me.

3868
02:16:38,340 --> 02:16:38,880
Got him.

3869
02:16:39,660 --> 02:16:41,620
Oh my god, we're fucking owning right now.

3870
02:16:41,880 --> 02:16:42,300
Next.

3871
02:16:42,800 --> 02:16:44,980
There's wingy, there's wingy.

3872
02:16:46,280 --> 02:16:46,880
Where's the wing?

3873
02:16:47,460 --> 02:16:48,620
I got it, I got it.

3874
02:16:49,480 --> 02:16:51,320
You can use it, just use it.

3875
02:16:51,320 --> 02:16:52,120
Okay, okay, okay.

3876
02:16:53,340 --> 02:16:54,540
There's four people on A.

3877
02:16:55,800 --> 02:16:56,200
Guys!

3878
02:16:57,060 --> 02:16:58,360
They're gonna take the wingy!

3879
02:17:00,940 --> 02:17:02,460
They took the wingy.

3880
02:17:03,660 --> 02:17:05,140
Wait, just go to A, no?

3881
02:17:07,520 --> 02:17:08,840
I'm literally on A.

3882
02:17:09,060 --> 02:17:09,940
Yeah, just take A.

3883
02:17:10,080 --> 02:17:10,780
I'm coming, I'm coming.

3884
02:17:12,260 --> 02:17:12,660
Phew.

3885
02:17:14,320 --> 02:17:15,260
Nice, free zone.

3886
02:17:16,040 --> 02:17:17,020
I just wanna hide.

3887
02:17:17,380 --> 02:17:18,400
Where the heck we got a free zone?

3888
02:17:18,700 --> 02:17:19,640
Yeah, we got a free zone.

3889
02:17:19,940 --> 02:17:20,220
Rowan.

3890
02:17:22,700 --> 02:17:23,020
Nice.

3891
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:24,840
How long does this game mode end?

3892
02:17:24,840 --> 02:17:25,480
Two, two, two, two.

3893
02:17:25,820 --> 02:17:27,000
Two on height, two on height, two on height.

3894
02:17:27,060 --> 02:17:27,740
Gibby, Gibby right here.

3895
02:17:28,320 --> 02:17:28,640
Okay.

3896
02:17:31,080 --> 02:17:31,600
I'm scanning.

3897
02:17:32,980 --> 02:17:33,300
I'm going up.

3898
02:17:33,300 --> 02:17:34,000
On me, on me, on me, on me.

3899
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:34,560
I'm moving up.

3900
02:17:35,600 --> 02:17:36,020
I'm coming.

3901
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:37,580
I got one.

3902
02:17:37,940 --> 02:17:39,060
Yeah, I can see him, I can see him.

3903
02:17:39,160 --> 02:17:39,500
Oh nice.

3904
02:17:39,500 --> 02:17:39,800
You got cross 50.

3905
02:17:40,560 --> 02:17:41,720
Wait, going up.

3906
02:17:41,960 --> 02:17:43,180
I'm gonna grab that triple take.

3907
02:17:43,540 --> 02:17:44,640
Oh, there's an EV, there's an EV!

3908
02:17:46,340 --> 02:17:47,100
I'm gonna grab it actually.

3909
02:17:47,100 --> 02:17:47,460
Oh my god.

3910
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:49,460
Don't worry.

3911
02:17:50,320 --> 02:17:51,080
I'm air support.

3912
02:17:52,520 --> 02:17:54,120
I'm under zip, under staircase.

3913
02:17:55,600 --> 02:17:56,880
Well, I dropped out guys.

3914
02:17:58,000 --> 02:17:59,560
Wait, this isn't even our point anymore.

3915
02:17:59,560 --> 02:18:00,460
Yeah, yeah, we have to go to B.

3916
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:01,780
Oh, what the fuck?

3917
02:18:01,840 --> 02:18:02,960
Yeah, we have to go to B.

3918
02:18:03,020 --> 02:18:03,920
I was like, what are you guys doing?

3919
02:18:04,100 --> 02:18:04,120
What happened?

3920
02:18:04,400 --> 02:18:05,640
I'm just chucking nades in there.

3921
02:18:08,280 --> 02:18:08,880
Alright, it's neutral.

3922
02:18:09,100 --> 02:18:09,680
I'm going in.

3923
02:18:09,680 --> 02:18:10,060
Yeah, going in.

3924
02:18:10,140 --> 02:18:10,980
There's one guy, there's one guy.

3925
02:18:13,100 --> 02:18:13,660
Oh, that's you.

3926
02:18:15,540 --> 02:18:15,860
Nice.

3927
02:18:15,860 --> 02:18:16,440
There's a wingman.

3928
02:18:18,280 --> 02:18:19,020
Oh my god.

3929
02:18:19,180 --> 02:18:19,580
I will that guy.

3930
02:18:20,160 --> 02:18:20,560
Wingman.

3931
02:18:20,700 --> 02:18:21,540
Wingman right here.

3932
02:18:22,520 --> 02:18:23,680
I need to heal.

3933
02:18:23,860 --> 02:18:24,700
I can't see anything.

3934
02:18:27,420 --> 02:18:29,320
Sully, go do your silly thing.

3935
02:18:29,600 --> 02:18:29,920
Behind me.

3936
02:18:30,980 --> 02:18:31,580
I'm good now.

3937
02:18:31,760 --> 02:18:34,160
I'm giving up the point.

3938
02:18:34,220 --> 02:18:34,660
What do you mean?

3939
02:18:34,720 --> 02:18:35,560
I'm still on it.

3940
02:18:35,940 --> 02:18:36,940
Why did you give up?

3941
02:18:37,540 --> 02:18:38,360
Wait, we're winning.

3942
02:18:39,180 --> 02:18:40,520
Wait, we're winning guys.

3943
02:18:40,780 --> 02:18:41,660
How do you win?

3944
02:18:43,340 --> 02:18:44,280
We need 500.

3945
02:18:44,380 --> 02:18:45,040
We're so close.

3946
02:18:45,540 --> 02:18:46,280
Keep going.

3947
02:18:46,280 --> 02:18:47,600
Oh, we're not winning.

3948
02:18:47,780 --> 02:18:48,260
We are.

3949
02:18:48,440 --> 02:18:50,040
We need like 30.

3950
02:18:50,260 --> 02:18:51,100
I'm going A.

3951
02:18:52,560 --> 02:18:53,480
We're literally 30.

3952
02:18:56,400 --> 02:18:57,240
We need A.

3953
02:19:00,020 --> 02:19:01,200
Oh, you're dying boy.

3954
02:19:01,820 --> 02:19:03,220
Oh, I'm so dead.

3955
02:19:04,320 --> 02:19:05,760
Oh, just grab A.

3956
02:19:05,860 --> 02:19:06,500
We're literally...

3957
02:19:08,540 --> 02:19:09,580
Come to me.

3958
02:19:10,120 --> 02:19:12,100
I'm holding it in for 4 seconds.

3959
02:19:13,560 --> 02:19:14,320
Did we do it?

3960
02:19:14,560 --> 02:19:14,580
Come on.

3961
02:19:14,640 --> 02:19:15,160
Wait, we won.

3962
02:19:16,280 --> 02:19:16,540
Oh my god.

3963
02:19:17,200 --> 02:19:18,580
Wait, we saw the...

3964
02:19:18,580 --> 02:19:19,060
Wait.

3965
02:19:21,040 --> 02:19:22,280
We won something.

3966
02:19:22,820 --> 02:19:23,700
You know what?

3967
02:19:23,840 --> 02:19:26,440
No matter what happens in the tournament, we won in lockdown.

3968
02:19:26,440 --> 02:19:26,940
We won this.

3969
02:19:27,060 --> 02:19:28,280
We won this.

3970
02:19:29,200 --> 02:19:31,140
I was sweaty as fuck.

3971
02:19:31,560 --> 02:19:32,940
This is our win.

3972
02:19:33,560 --> 02:19:34,880
Just in time too.

3973
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:36,840
We have 5 minutes to match.

3974
02:19:38,560 --> 02:19:39,880
Wait, we still have 5 minutes?

3975
02:19:40,280 --> 02:19:40,660
No, no.

3976
02:19:40,760 --> 02:19:42,980
Yeah, we have like 5 minutes to match.

3977
02:19:43,500 --> 02:19:45,720
I don't think we can get another lockdown in guys.

3978
02:19:45,780 --> 02:19:46,180
I almost did it.

3979
02:19:46,280 --> 02:19:47,200
We have a storm point again.

3980
02:19:48,400 --> 02:19:50,580
What happened in our last storm point game?

3981
02:19:51,360 --> 02:19:55,500
Remember when we tried to land and then like another team landed on our spot?

3982
02:19:56,440 --> 02:19:58,000
Yeah, that's what happened.

3983
02:19:58,320 --> 02:20:00,340
Did you just relive the PTSD?

3984
02:20:00,920 --> 02:20:01,160
Yeah.

3985
02:20:01,660 --> 02:20:04,120
Yeah, I had to start a race from...

3986
02:20:04,120 --> 02:20:05,900
Do you guys want a shotgun 1v1?

3987
02:20:06,280 --> 02:20:08,220
A shotgun 1v1?

3988
02:20:08,740 --> 02:20:09,700
It's starting soon.

3989
02:20:10,140 --> 02:20:11,620
Yeah, everyone's in.

3990
02:20:11,740 --> 02:20:12,800
I can't even move there.

3991
02:20:13,400 --> 02:20:14,980
Wait, someone move me.

3992
02:20:16,060 --> 02:20:16,920
Where's the code?

3993
02:20:17,280 --> 02:20:18,800
I'm gonna leave again and then join back in.

3994
02:20:19,300 --> 02:20:20,180
There we go.

3995
02:20:21,460 --> 02:20:22,620
There's the code.

3996
02:20:23,120 --> 02:20:23,700
I joined back.

3997
02:20:24,020 --> 02:20:25,500
Oh yeah, I need someone to move me.

3998
02:20:26,080 --> 02:20:27,280
Wait, what the fuck?

3999
02:20:27,440 --> 02:20:28,460
I can't move, yeah.

4000
02:20:30,160 --> 02:20:31,260
I'm fucking stuck.

4001
02:20:31,640 --> 02:20:32,640
Don't keep burning.

4002
02:20:34,160 --> 02:20:34,640
Sad.

4003
02:20:36,180 --> 02:20:37,120
Team 1 please.

4004
02:20:40,140 --> 02:20:41,100
Can't move.

4005
02:20:44,280 --> 02:20:45,680
Put me in, coach.

4006
02:20:47,860 --> 02:20:48,500
Put me in, coach.

4007
02:20:48,500 --> 02:20:48,560
Sad.

4008
02:20:50,920 --> 02:20:51,920
I'm stuck.

4009
02:20:51,960 --> 02:20:52,440
Coach!

4010
02:20:53,120 --> 02:20:54,020
I'm stuck.

4011
02:20:54,060 --> 02:20:55,320
Get me off the bench, coach.

4012
02:20:55,760 --> 02:20:56,240
Please.

4013
02:20:57,580 --> 02:20:59,060
Let me play.

4014
02:21:01,300 --> 02:21:03,100
They put me in the sad corner.

4015
02:21:06,650 --> 02:21:07,410
It's okay.

4016
02:21:07,530 --> 02:21:11,430
We're not the last team to join the lobby.

4017
02:21:12,670 --> 02:21:13,310
We're not the last team to join the lobby.

4018
02:21:13,310 --> 02:21:13,770
We're not the last team to join the lobby.

4019
02:21:13,770 --> 02:21:14,150
Exactly.

4020
02:21:14,150 --> 02:21:15,850
Well, technically we're here already, yeah?

4021
02:21:17,870 --> 02:21:19,290
Yeah, we're all here.

4022
02:21:19,670 --> 02:21:21,790
I'm just not on a team because I'm stuck.

4023
02:21:21,990 --> 02:21:22,030
Hey, there you go.

4024
02:21:24,150 --> 02:21:25,450
I'm stuck, bro.

4025
02:21:27,170 --> 02:21:27,650
Azath.

4026
02:21:29,390 --> 02:21:29,870
Azath.

4027
02:21:29,970 --> 02:21:31,730
I'm gonna go get a snack for your back.

4028
02:21:32,130 --> 02:21:32,610
Alright.

4029
02:21:33,310 --> 02:21:34,050
Snack break.

4030
02:21:36,070 --> 02:21:37,350
Full snack break.

4031
02:21:37,810 --> 02:21:39,190
What games have you been playing, Yuris?

4032
02:21:39,210 --> 02:21:41,790
Other than Overwatch and Valorant.

4033
02:21:41,830 --> 02:21:42,670
Is it just those three?

4034
02:21:43,770 --> 02:21:43,970
Uh...

4035
02:21:43,970 --> 02:21:49,970
Yeah, I thought you were not gonna fucking include Valorant.

4036
02:21:50,010 --> 02:21:51,630
I'm like, yeah, I could Valorant too.

4037
02:21:51,950 --> 02:21:54,410
To be fair, there's no other FPS games right now.

4038
02:21:54,590 --> 02:21:54,730
I just do some...

4039
02:21:54,730 --> 02:21:57,690
Yeah, I just do some IRL streaming.

4040
02:21:59,290 --> 02:22:01,470
You guys were at karaoke yesterday, right?

4041
02:22:02,730 --> 02:22:03,730
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4042
02:22:04,010 --> 02:22:05,830
Dude, that shit was sick.

4043
02:22:07,130 --> 02:22:07,730
That's true.

4044
02:22:08,030 --> 02:22:10,990
Like, the karaoke's in Japan is like insane.

4045
02:22:12,910 --> 02:22:15,290
There's like two so much shit you can do there.

4046
02:22:15,590 --> 02:22:16,470
We were with, um...

4047
02:22:16,470 --> 02:22:18,430
like a professional singer.

4048
02:22:18,770 --> 02:22:20,130
Like, actually, like...

4049
02:22:20,130 --> 02:22:21,290
Damn!

4050
02:22:21,430 --> 02:22:25,010
He like makes like anime music.

4051
02:22:25,390 --> 02:22:26,830
Oh shit, like what anime?

4052
02:22:28,790 --> 02:22:29,670
Um...

4053
02:22:29,670 --> 02:22:30,730
Every anime.

4054
02:22:32,050 --> 02:22:39,830
The specific anime is Namara Menkyou Dosankou A Cute Hokkaido Girl.

4055
02:22:40,290 --> 02:22:41,170
Um...

4056
02:22:41,770 --> 02:22:43,630
He makes... What do you call that?

4057
02:22:44,230 --> 02:22:44,750
Overkill?

4058
02:22:44,970 --> 02:22:45,730
What is that anime?

4059
02:22:47,910 --> 02:22:48,430
Overkill?

4060
02:22:50,610 --> 02:22:51,310
What is it?

4061
02:22:51,350 --> 02:22:51,770
Overkill?

4062
02:22:52,090 --> 02:22:53,750
I heard that name is familiar.

4063
02:22:55,050 --> 02:22:55,570
Overkill.

4064
02:22:55,990 --> 02:22:56,510
Overload.

4065
02:22:57,830 --> 02:22:58,590
Overload, yeah.

4066
02:22:59,490 --> 02:23:00,010
Overload.

4067
02:23:01,510 --> 02:23:02,390
That's pretty sick.

4068
02:23:02,450 --> 02:23:03,610
Oh, so he does like the...

4069
02:23:03,610 --> 02:23:05,450
Wait, he does like the opening?

4070
02:23:05,590 --> 02:23:06,290
For Overload?

4071
02:23:06,550 --> 02:23:06,790
Yeah.

4072
02:23:07,690 --> 02:23:08,730
Oh shit!

4073
02:23:10,990 --> 02:23:11,890
That's sick.

4074
02:23:13,530 --> 02:23:14,530
Yeah, yeah.

4075
02:23:15,690 --> 02:23:17,990
It's surprising how like many like famous...

4076
02:23:18,510 --> 02:23:19,030
OXC as well.

4077
02:23:19,390 --> 02:23:23,390
How many like famous Japanese celebrities play Apex.

4078
02:23:24,610 --> 02:23:25,970
I do... I know!

4079
02:23:26,270 --> 02:23:27,630
It's actually absurd.

4080
02:23:28,110 --> 02:23:28,790
It's crazy, yeah.

4081
02:23:28,890 --> 02:23:33,110
I remember that one tournament, I just finished watching, um...

4082
02:23:33,110 --> 02:23:34,590
Alice in the Borderland.

4083
02:23:34,830 --> 02:23:35,230
Yeah.

4084
02:23:35,270 --> 02:23:37,550
And the guy was playing in it.

4085
02:23:37,590 --> 02:23:40,330
I'm like, wait, I just finished watching that show!

4086
02:23:41,890 --> 02:23:43,610
One of the main characters playing Apex!

4087
02:23:43,670 --> 02:23:46,030
He's in... he's in my fucking game?

4088
02:23:46,270 --> 02:23:46,430
Like...

4089
02:23:47,550 --> 02:23:49,150
He's in my game, bro!

4090
02:23:49,190 --> 02:23:49,930
Like wait...

4091
02:23:49,930 --> 02:23:50,430
That's crazy.

4092
02:23:50,850 --> 02:23:52,770
He's playing with uh, Jim Burton and...

4093
02:23:54,910 --> 02:23:55,790
Oh, shit!

4094
02:23:56,930 --> 02:23:58,110
That's actually insane.

4095
02:23:58,890 --> 02:23:59,330
Yeah.

4096
02:23:59,950 --> 02:24:00,890
That's so cool.

4097
02:24:01,070 --> 02:24:02,030
I remember like when I was in...

4098
02:24:02,030 --> 02:24:05,610
When I was in Japan, like I went to like the, uh...

4099
02:24:05,610 --> 02:24:07,490
I went to like the Apex...

4100
02:24:07,490 --> 02:24:09,550
The Apex fucking cafe.

4101
02:24:10,050 --> 02:24:16,450
And then I saw like a bunch of girls taking like, like aesthetic photos with their like Apex Legends acrylic stands with their food.

4102
02:24:16,650 --> 02:24:20,970
And I was like, They were like... they were like super fashionable too.

4103
02:24:21,110 --> 02:24:22,250
I was like, holy shit!

4104
02:24:22,630 --> 02:24:29,510
Like, I did not realize like... Like I knew Apex was popular, but I didn't know it was like that popular type deal.

4105
02:24:29,710 --> 02:24:33,390
Where people were taking like actual like aesthetic photos and stuff with their food.

4106
02:24:33,850 --> 02:24:34,030
Mhm.

4107
02:24:34,650 --> 02:24:35,210
Yeah.

4108
02:24:35,650 --> 02:24:37,710
We're not all stinky gamers anymore!

4109
02:24:37,710 --> 02:24:40,490
Yeah, like bro, it's not just gamers!

4110
02:24:41,890 --> 02:24:42,510
It's not just...

4111
02:24:45,710 --> 02:24:46,510
Yeah... Yeah...

4112
02:24:48,230 --> 02:24:49,030
What am I playing?

4113
02:24:49,230 --> 02:24:49,630
Valkyrie?

4114
02:24:49,810 --> 02:24:50,970
I guess we're going to the same comp, right?

4115
02:24:51,230 --> 02:24:51,790
Yeah, yeah.

4116
02:24:51,910 --> 02:24:53,110
Same comp, same comp.

4117
02:24:56,630 --> 02:25:02,810
Hopefully we land in a place that isn't full of people that just landed as well.

4118
02:25:02,970 --> 02:25:03,230
Yeah, isn't.

4119
02:25:03,570 --> 02:25:03,970
Yeah.

4120
02:25:04,090 --> 02:25:06,490
But listen, we had the same, you know, thoughts.

4121
02:25:06,670 --> 02:25:07,830
They were just like a little faster.

4122
02:25:08,250 --> 02:25:09,970
Yeah, we were like 10 seconds faster.

4123
02:25:10,790 --> 02:25:12,930
They would have been fucking in the bin.

4124
02:25:13,230 --> 02:25:15,730
Yeah, if we were there first, yeah.

4125
02:25:16,710 --> 02:25:17,670
We hesitated.

4126
02:25:18,710 --> 02:25:21,870
I would have like 500 damage at that point, like god damn.

4127
02:25:25,720 --> 02:25:26,200
Okay.

4128
02:25:26,620 --> 02:25:27,900
More than 60 damage.

4129
02:25:27,940 --> 02:25:28,500
Oh, same.

4130
02:25:29,540 --> 02:25:30,260
Yeah, same.

4131
02:25:30,780 --> 02:25:32,120
But this isn't the last, right?

4132
02:25:32,320 --> 02:25:34,080
No, no, we have one game after that.

4133
02:25:38,600 --> 02:25:39,080
Please.

4134
02:25:40,040 --> 02:25:42,300
If there is a god of Apex Legends.

4135
02:25:43,200 --> 02:25:44,140
Give us some...

4136
02:25:44,820 --> 02:25:45,940
More than 60 damage.

4137
02:25:47,080 --> 02:25:50,120
Okay, I think for that to happen, one of us has to crash.

4138
02:25:50,500 --> 02:25:50,560
Wait, I don't think that's the Apex Legends...

4139
02:25:51,980 --> 02:25:53,540
I don't think it has...

4140
02:25:53,540 --> 02:25:55,320
It's up to the Apex Legends gods.

4141
02:25:56,100 --> 02:25:57,680
It's up to you, Ty.

4142
02:25:58,480 --> 02:25:59,420
It's up to you.

4143
02:25:59,420 --> 02:26:03,200
No, no, like, you guys don't understand my struggles.

4144
02:26:05,420 --> 02:26:07,040
You'll never understand me.

4145
02:26:08,620 --> 02:26:09,780
It's never my fault.

4146
02:26:09,780 --> 02:26:11,840
Can I land here or is that off-limits?

4147
02:26:12,820 --> 02:26:14,720
I feel like... I mean, you don't want to get shot by these.

4148
02:26:14,820 --> 02:26:16,520
You could land there and do the...

4149
02:26:16,520 --> 02:26:17,720
do the dogs.

4150
02:26:18,180 --> 02:26:19,480
Yeah, just don't die.

4151
02:26:19,760 --> 02:26:20,920
I'm scared.

4152
02:26:21,220 --> 02:26:21,520
Are you a pussy?

4153
02:26:21,920 --> 02:26:23,000
Are you a little bitch?

4154
02:26:23,640 --> 02:26:24,200
Yes!

4155
02:26:24,820 --> 02:26:26,580
I'm a little bitch, what do you want?

4156
02:26:28,520 --> 02:26:29,720
I'm scared as fuck.

4157
02:26:30,960 --> 02:26:32,240
I'm scared as fuck!

4158
02:26:32,600 --> 02:26:34,380
Typical Overwatch player.

4159
02:26:35,460 --> 02:26:36,440
Little bitch.

4160
02:26:37,820 --> 02:26:40,160
Overwatch player being a little bitch?

4161
02:26:41,380 --> 02:26:42,860
I dropped the nemesis.

4162
02:26:42,860 --> 02:26:43,040
Typical.

4163
02:26:44,740 --> 02:26:46,360
If anyone wants a nemesis.

4164
02:26:47,560 --> 02:26:48,300
I'm a...

4165
02:26:48,300 --> 02:26:49,700
have a locker myself.

4166
02:26:51,820 --> 02:26:52,540
Let's see.

4167
02:26:52,680 --> 02:26:56,060
I need like... if anyone finds a vault, let me know and they don't want it.

4168
02:26:57,580 --> 02:26:58,260
Yes sir!

4169
02:26:59,780 --> 02:27:00,260
Alright.

4170
02:27:01,920 --> 02:27:02,580
Let's see.

4171
02:27:03,020 --> 02:27:03,660
It's okay.

4172
02:27:03,820 --> 02:27:04,460
We are...

4173
02:27:04,460 --> 02:27:06,140
Hey, it's the same... it could be same zone?

4174
02:27:06,680 --> 02:27:08,180
It's literally the same circle.

4175
02:27:09,380 --> 02:27:12,360
Yeah, they love that fucking pylon zone, huh?

4176
02:27:13,580 --> 02:27:16,620
It looks literally the same as the last Stormpoint game.

4177
02:27:20,200 --> 02:27:21,840
Oh, scan by survey beacon.

4178
02:27:22,080 --> 02:27:23,020
Oh, we are scanned by here.

4179
02:27:24,680 --> 02:27:26,180
Oh, good thing I land there.

4180
02:27:26,260 --> 02:27:26,680
Holy shit.

4181
02:27:27,740 --> 02:27:29,540
I mean, you'd be...

4182
02:27:29,540 --> 02:27:30,540
Yeah, no, no.

4183
02:27:30,560 --> 02:27:31,580
You would land here.

4184
02:27:31,700 --> 02:27:32,360
They are like here.

4185
02:27:32,540 --> 02:27:33,240
What do you mean?

4186
02:27:34,520 --> 02:27:36,440
Yeah, that's your ping, I think.

4187
02:27:36,900 --> 02:27:38,320
That was your ping.

4188
02:27:41,380 --> 02:27:41,820
Uh...

4189
02:27:43,420 --> 02:27:45,020
I dropped a purple...

4190
02:27:45,020 --> 02:27:46,480
laser sight.

4191
02:27:47,220 --> 02:27:48,220
I'll take that.

4192
02:27:50,420 --> 02:27:52,020
Okay, I need a backpack though.

4193
02:27:52,980 --> 02:27:54,680
Low key kind of...

4194
02:27:55,140 --> 02:27:56,960
kind of here without a bag.

4195
02:27:58,120 --> 02:27:59,120
Oh, I found...

4196
02:27:59,120 --> 02:27:59,900
Oh, is that backpack?

4197
02:28:00,220 --> 02:28:00,760
Yeah.

4198
02:28:00,840 --> 02:28:01,580
There's a bag here.

4199
02:28:02,140 --> 02:28:02,820
Thank you.

4200
02:28:04,540 --> 02:28:05,920
Try to find a vault.

4201
02:28:06,400 --> 02:28:07,820
I have an L-star carbine.

4202
02:28:11,850 --> 02:28:13,270
Did you loot the back yet?

4203
02:28:14,090 --> 02:28:14,890
Yeah, I...

4204
02:28:16,130 --> 02:28:16,810
Where's that...

4205
02:28:16,810 --> 02:28:17,430
Where's that...

4206
02:28:18,670 --> 02:28:19,730
What do you call this thing?

4207
02:28:19,930 --> 02:28:20,510
Holy shit.

4208
02:28:20,690 --> 02:28:21,330
Laser sight.

4209
02:28:21,450 --> 02:28:23,290
I forgot the fucking attachment.

4210
02:28:24,490 --> 02:28:25,370
I dropped...

4211
02:28:25,830 --> 02:28:28,250
I dropped it like all the way over the back there.

4212
02:28:28,750 --> 02:28:29,190
The purple one?

4213
02:28:29,190 --> 02:28:30,410
I don't know if Taya got it.

4214
02:28:30,490 --> 02:28:31,530
Did you already got the laser sight?

4215
02:28:31,650 --> 02:28:33,290
No, I didn't pick it out.

4216
02:28:33,750 --> 02:28:34,390
It's all yours.

4217
02:28:35,190 --> 02:28:35,810
There it is.

4218
02:28:36,890 --> 02:28:37,770
Oh, please.

4219
02:28:39,610 --> 02:28:43,910
Alright, we should go over here and then scan the beacon and grab this.

4220
02:28:44,010 --> 02:28:44,310
Yeah.

4221
02:28:44,310 --> 02:28:44,570
Go ahead.

4222
02:28:45,450 --> 02:28:47,090
Oh, there's your hair and a lightning rod.

4223
02:28:48,990 --> 02:28:49,730
I'm heading over.

4224
02:28:52,850 --> 02:28:53,650
Heading over.

4225
02:28:53,650 --> 02:28:53,970
Heading over.

4226
02:28:53,970 --> 02:28:54,630
Let me see, uh...

4227
02:28:54,630 --> 02:28:56,170
Ultimate accelerant.

4228
02:28:57,330 --> 02:28:58,390
I have one.

4229
02:28:58,490 --> 02:28:59,330
I have an ultimate accelerant.

4230
02:28:59,330 --> 02:29:00,230
I'm holding one right now.

4231
02:29:00,390 --> 02:29:02,850
I just need a fucking vault.

4232
02:29:03,410 --> 02:29:04,390
I have an L-star.

4233
02:29:06,830 --> 02:29:09,270
I'm using a b-b-b-b-b-b-bolt as well.

4234
02:29:10,950 --> 02:29:11,430
Alright.

4235
02:29:11,750 --> 02:29:14,750
I can make do with an L-star for now.

4236
02:29:14,910 --> 02:29:15,430
Wait, there's a...

4237
02:29:15,450 --> 02:29:16,710
Is there a package behind us?

4238
02:29:17,030 --> 02:29:18,250
No, that's a crow, JK.

4239
02:29:19,450 --> 02:29:19,910
JK.

4240
02:29:21,990 --> 02:29:24,490
I looked at my map and I was like, wait a minute.

4241
02:29:26,910 --> 02:29:27,770
Got my drop.

4242
02:29:28,070 --> 02:29:28,690
Gamer here.

4243
02:29:31,430 --> 02:29:34,750
Oh, you should scan the drops to Tayo and...

4244
02:29:35,360 --> 02:29:36,230
Wait, I can scan them?

4245
02:29:37,070 --> 02:29:38,310
Yeah, the drops.

4246
02:29:41,390 --> 02:29:43,750
Well, well, well, if you see it on the sky.

4247
02:29:44,810 --> 02:29:45,810
I'm gonna scan.

4248
02:29:47,250 --> 02:29:48,610
See where they're rotating.

4249
02:29:48,610 --> 02:29:49,130
We should do the same rotating.

4250
02:29:49,410 --> 02:29:50,110
We go up there.

4251
02:29:50,250 --> 02:29:51,370
Oh my god.

4252
02:29:51,390 --> 02:29:52,310
Oh my god.

4253
02:29:52,790 --> 02:29:53,670
They're all here.

4254
02:29:54,270 --> 02:29:58,330
This looks like our launch pad zone, guys.

4255
02:29:58,730 --> 02:29:59,730
What do you think?

4256
02:30:01,630 --> 02:30:03,170
I don't think I listen.

4257
02:30:04,930 --> 02:30:07,810
There's like... There's only... There's no one around us, too.

4258
02:30:10,750 --> 02:30:11,310
Uh...

4259
02:30:11,310 --> 02:30:13,090
The closest... The closest... I'm coming up.

4260
02:30:13,170 --> 02:30:13,890
...scan is here.

4261
02:30:18,810 --> 02:30:19,170
Uh...

4262
02:30:19,170 --> 02:30:20,270
Oh, yours all went up.

4263
02:30:20,270 --> 02:30:20,670
I'm coming back.

4264
02:30:20,810 --> 02:30:21,550
I wanted to...

4265
02:30:22,110 --> 02:30:22,470
Yeah, yeah.

4266
02:30:24,270 --> 02:30:25,870
I am 10 seconds behind.

4267
02:30:26,230 --> 02:30:26,590
We're gonna play for this beacon scan.

4268
02:30:26,710 --> 02:30:28,390
You want me to give you the bolt?

4269
02:30:28,530 --> 02:30:29,770
No, I'm good.

4270
02:30:29,830 --> 02:30:30,110
I'm good.

4271
02:30:30,150 --> 02:30:30,970
I can work with L-Star.

4272
02:30:31,210 --> 02:30:32,590
I got good... I have a carbine.

4273
02:30:32,870 --> 02:30:34,810
I found a peacekeeper, so...

4274
02:30:34,810 --> 02:30:35,150
Oh, okay.

4275
02:30:35,330 --> 02:30:36,130
I can grab it.

4276
02:30:36,730 --> 02:30:38,650
Oh, it's right here.

4277
02:30:39,530 --> 02:30:39,890
Alright.

4278
02:30:43,830 --> 02:30:44,650
It's open here.

4279
02:30:44,990 --> 02:30:46,370
There were people in Command Center.

4280
02:30:46,450 --> 02:30:47,470
They might have rotated from there.

4281
02:30:49,070 --> 02:30:49,510
Yeah.

4282
02:30:52,450 --> 02:30:54,150
Regret... Regretty the decision.

4283
02:30:55,950 --> 02:30:57,290
Um... Still far.

4284
02:30:57,690 --> 02:30:59,210
Still don't get into a fight.

4285
02:31:01,250 --> 02:31:02,930
I am waiting.

4286
02:31:04,070 --> 02:31:05,250
I wanna do the...

4287
02:31:06,790 --> 02:31:07,230
speeder.

4288
02:31:07,250 --> 02:31:07,470
Oh, wait.

4289
02:31:07,490 --> 02:31:08,150
They probably did it.

4290
02:31:09,590 --> 02:31:10,170
Ah, no.

4291
02:31:10,270 --> 02:31:10,850
It's still here.

4292
02:31:11,110 --> 02:31:11,550
Okay.

4293
02:31:13,830 --> 02:31:14,070
I'm gonna do it now.

4294
02:31:16,530 --> 02:31:17,330
I'm almost there.

4295
02:31:18,770 --> 02:31:20,110
I have no big medkits.

4296
02:31:20,850 --> 02:31:21,990
Um... I have two medkits.

4297
02:31:22,030 --> 02:31:22,630
I can give you one.

4298
02:31:23,390 --> 02:31:25,610
I think two... I have two as well.

4299
02:31:26,070 --> 02:31:27,370
I'll just take one from you, Houston.

4300
02:31:28,290 --> 02:31:29,050
Give me it!

4301
02:31:29,310 --> 02:31:29,810
Thank you!

4302
02:31:31,270 --> 02:31:31,890
Oh my god.

4303
02:31:32,030 --> 02:31:33,070
He might...

4304
02:31:33,470 --> 02:31:34,010
Oh my god.

4305
02:31:34,030 --> 02:31:34,310
Thank god.

4306
02:31:34,670 --> 02:31:35,570
We're not 20th.

4307
02:31:36,170 --> 02:31:37,270
That's all that matters.

4308
02:31:38,190 --> 02:31:38,750
Oh, yeah.

4309
02:31:38,850 --> 02:31:39,450
They did... they did...

4310
02:31:39,450 --> 02:31:41,370
They did the fucking... eggs.

4311
02:31:42,270 --> 02:31:43,590
Whatever these things are called.

4312
02:31:45,030 --> 02:31:46,210
I'm gonna do the...

4313
02:31:46,210 --> 02:31:47,930
Oh, don't scan the beacon right away.

4314
02:31:48,130 --> 02:31:48,370
Yeah.

4315
02:31:48,410 --> 02:31:50,010
Let's do this... let's do the spiders.

4316
02:31:50,370 --> 02:31:52,150
And then we... The door's open, by the way.

4317
02:31:53,410 --> 02:31:53,810
Yeah.

4318
02:31:54,850 --> 02:31:55,250
Sketchy.

4319
02:31:57,070 --> 02:31:57,790
Pretty sketch.

4320
02:31:58,650 --> 02:31:59,290
Bat here.

4321
02:31:59,730 --> 02:32:00,290
This too.

4322
02:32:02,910 --> 02:32:03,870
Uh... I'll take the bat.

4323
02:32:03,950 --> 02:32:04,570
I don't have any bat.

4324
02:32:04,630 --> 02:32:04,770
Oh.

4325
02:32:05,010 --> 02:32:06,590
I don't have a bat.

4326
02:32:06,670 --> 02:32:06,870
A drug.

4327
02:32:06,970 --> 02:32:07,370
Yeah.

4328
02:32:07,430 --> 02:32:08,170
I'm a little broke.

4329
02:32:11,050 --> 02:32:11,450
Alright.

4330
02:32:11,450 --> 02:32:11,670
Alright.

4331
02:32:11,670 --> 02:32:12,810
Go for the beacon scan.

4332
02:32:12,890 --> 02:32:13,210
Alright.

4333
02:32:13,310 --> 02:32:14,550
I'll go back for the beacon.

4334
02:32:17,450 --> 02:32:18,990
Not last, baby.

4335
02:32:21,470 --> 02:32:22,670
Not last again.

4336
02:32:23,090 --> 02:32:23,650
Let's go.

4337
02:32:24,150 --> 02:32:24,810
We're consistent.

4338
02:32:24,850 --> 02:32:25,870
We're doing really good right now.

4339
02:32:26,010 --> 02:32:26,710
Yeah, we're consistent.

4340
02:32:26,990 --> 02:32:26,990
Very consistent.

4341
02:32:28,110 --> 02:32:29,090
Where do we go?

4342
02:32:31,230 --> 02:32:31,910
Oh, yeah.

4343
02:32:31,910 --> 02:32:32,770
It's definitely launchpad.

4344
02:32:33,390 --> 02:32:33,910
Nice.

4345
02:32:33,970 --> 02:32:34,230
Alright.

4346
02:32:34,290 --> 02:32:34,630
We're good.

4347
02:32:35,290 --> 02:32:36,650
Um... Team there.

4348
02:32:37,230 --> 02:32:38,530
Team about to be here.

4349
02:32:38,730 --> 02:32:39,770
They're probably gonna rotate down.

4350
02:32:41,630 --> 02:32:43,410
Do we command center jump or...

4351
02:32:45,810 --> 02:32:46,610
Um... Nah.

4352
02:32:46,750 --> 02:32:47,410
I think we just...

4353
02:32:47,410 --> 02:32:48,930
go down normally.

4354
02:32:49,530 --> 02:32:51,010
And then go...

4355
02:32:51,010 --> 02:32:53,350
I wanna get this, to be honest.

4356
02:32:53,890 --> 02:32:54,490
Which one?

4357
02:32:54,590 --> 02:32:54,890
This?

4358
02:32:55,010 --> 02:32:55,550
Sirm Catcher?

4359
02:32:55,690 --> 02:32:56,230
The left one.

4360
02:32:56,410 --> 02:32:56,670
Yeah.

4361
02:32:56,750 --> 02:32:57,370
This Harvester?

4362
02:32:57,550 --> 02:32:57,810
Yeah.

4363
02:32:57,870 --> 02:32:58,270
Yeah.

4364
02:32:58,390 --> 02:32:58,530
Yeah.

4365
02:32:58,870 --> 02:33:00,690
I mean, there's no one contesting us for it.

4366
02:33:00,770 --> 02:33:01,030
Let's drop right now.

4367
02:33:01,730 --> 02:33:02,130
Yeah.

4368
02:33:02,130 --> 02:33:03,030
I'm right behind you.

4369
02:33:04,070 --> 02:33:05,430
I'm gonna go down.

4370
02:33:05,450 --> 02:33:06,870
Drop right here and then... One sec.

4371
02:33:06,950 --> 02:33:07,330
One sec.

4372
02:33:08,250 --> 02:33:08,650
Harvester.

4373
02:33:10,630 --> 02:33:11,170
Go ahead.

4374
02:33:11,170 --> 02:33:11,370
I'm ready.

4375
02:33:12,090 --> 02:33:13,410
I'll jump down the other one.

4376
02:33:14,510 --> 02:33:15,070
Yay.

4377
02:33:17,310 --> 02:33:18,490
Oh my god.

4378
02:33:19,630 --> 02:33:20,850
Not scared at all.

4379
02:33:20,850 --> 02:33:21,470
So scary.

4380
02:33:22,830 --> 02:33:23,390
Yeah.

4381
02:33:24,510 --> 02:33:26,330
We just land on a full team.

4382
02:33:26,610 --> 02:33:26,750
So sketch.

4383
02:33:27,090 --> 02:33:28,610
They're just looking at us.

4384
02:33:28,650 --> 02:33:30,350
Fucking ratting.

4385
02:33:30,350 --> 02:33:30,890
Oh.

4386
02:33:32,490 --> 02:33:34,970
We're not in 19th place as well.

4387
02:33:35,150 --> 02:33:35,630
Hey.

4388
02:33:35,630 --> 02:33:36,870
We're fucking improving.

4389
02:33:37,250 --> 02:33:37,750
Let's go.

4390
02:33:38,110 --> 02:33:38,990
We're surviving.

4391
02:33:39,490 --> 02:33:39,810
Yeah.

4392
02:33:39,830 --> 02:33:40,810
We're getting better and better.

4393
02:33:42,970 --> 02:33:43,430
Oh.

4394
02:33:43,550 --> 02:33:44,330
There's a drop here too.

4395
02:33:44,490 --> 02:33:45,460
I'm gonna go for the Harvester.

4396
02:33:47,010 --> 02:33:47,970
You guys can go for the drop.

4397
02:33:48,150 --> 02:33:48,570
Okay.

4398
02:33:48,910 --> 02:33:51,750
The crow went this way.

4399
02:33:52,050 --> 02:33:52,510
What?

4400
02:33:53,550 --> 02:33:55,290
Should I get the golden repeater?

4401
02:33:56,370 --> 02:33:56,830
Yeah.

4402
02:33:56,830 --> 02:33:57,210
Do it.

4403
02:33:59,470 --> 02:34:00,550
I'll go with Tayo.

4404
02:34:00,670 --> 02:34:02,130
Just in case we get...

4405
02:34:03,230 --> 02:34:03,930
Ape done.

4406
02:34:04,670 --> 02:34:05,130
Yeah.

4407
02:34:05,130 --> 02:34:05,970
I'll look behind.

4408
02:34:06,210 --> 02:34:07,030
Is my crow going backwards?

4409
02:34:07,030 --> 02:34:09,810
We're just gonna go down in this... the cannon.

4410
02:34:09,810 --> 02:34:12,010
I have a lot of attachments for my hemlock.

4411
02:34:12,170 --> 02:34:12,810
If you guys want.

4412
02:34:13,830 --> 02:34:14,550
Like purple.

4413
02:34:14,930 --> 02:34:15,570
You have a 3x on it?

4414
02:34:15,830 --> 02:34:16,210
Yeah.

4415
02:34:16,930 --> 02:34:17,330
2x4.

4416
02:34:18,290 --> 02:34:18,690
Wait.

4417
02:34:19,690 --> 02:34:20,110
What's this?

4418
02:34:20,530 --> 02:34:21,110
The cache?

4419
02:34:21,330 --> 02:34:21,350
Oh.

4420
02:34:21,390 --> 02:34:22,150
It makes you purple.

4421
02:34:22,330 --> 02:34:23,190
I think you should have it.

4422
02:34:23,630 --> 02:34:23,830
Yeah.

4423
02:34:23,830 --> 02:34:25,070
You should have it.

4424
02:34:25,150 --> 02:34:25,550
Yeah.

4425
02:34:25,590 --> 02:34:25,790
Yeah.

4426
02:34:25,850 --> 02:34:25,990
Yeah.

4427
02:34:26,330 --> 02:34:28,070
The pro should have this.

4428
02:34:30,550 --> 02:34:31,130
Not me.

4429
02:34:31,890 --> 02:34:32,290
Wait.

4430
02:34:32,330 --> 02:34:32,970
Did you take it?

4431
02:34:33,290 --> 02:34:33,690
No.

4432
02:34:33,690 --> 02:34:34,090
No.

4433
02:34:34,130 --> 02:34:34,310
No.

4434
02:34:34,310 --> 02:34:34,390
No.

4435
02:34:34,390 --> 02:34:34,630
Okay.

4436
02:34:34,730 --> 02:34:35,290
I thought you did.

4437
02:34:35,610 --> 02:34:36,690
Because you went purple.

4438
02:34:36,690 --> 02:34:37,610
I was like wait.

4439
02:34:37,690 --> 02:34:38,090
What the fuck?

4440
02:34:38,110 --> 02:34:39,710
Be careful of a team coming here.

4441
02:34:39,850 --> 02:34:40,090
Yeah.

4442
02:34:40,170 --> 02:34:40,970
There was a team that scanned us.

4443
02:34:42,710 --> 02:34:44,510
Are you gonna come?

4444
02:34:44,650 --> 02:34:44,730
Yeah.

4445
02:34:44,830 --> 02:34:46,090
I'm just guarding this shit.

4446
02:34:46,410 --> 02:34:47,790
I'll scan behind the drone.

4447
02:34:48,010 --> 02:34:48,010
Yeah.

4448
02:34:48,770 --> 02:34:50,670
Just make sure no team walks up on us.

4449
02:34:50,690 --> 02:34:51,390
Just in case.

4450
02:34:51,530 --> 02:34:51,850
Yeah.

4451
02:34:51,970 --> 02:34:52,730
Make sure...

4452
02:34:52,730 --> 02:34:53,170
Yeah.

4453
02:34:53,170 --> 02:34:54,730
Cause we're not getting mirrored by that team.

4454
02:34:57,810 --> 02:34:58,610
Looks clear.

4455
02:35:01,230 --> 02:35:02,870
I want them to go on the other side.

4456
02:35:03,530 --> 02:35:04,250
Where's this chick?

4457
02:35:04,970 --> 02:35:05,910
Where do we go next?

4458
02:35:06,830 --> 02:35:07,310
Alright.

4459
02:35:07,450 --> 02:35:09,090
We're just playing this cannon area.

4460
02:35:09,390 --> 02:35:09,630
Yeah.

4461
02:35:09,750 --> 02:35:11,630
There's most likely a team that...

4462
02:35:12,950 --> 02:35:15,230
I can't really do in-fighting.

4463
02:35:15,230 --> 02:35:15,530
Oh, Ty.

4464
02:35:15,530 --> 02:35:15,910
Come here.

4465
02:35:16,310 --> 02:35:16,790
Yeah.

4466
02:35:16,850 --> 02:35:17,170
I'm coming.

4467
02:35:17,210 --> 02:35:17,390
I'm coming.

4468
02:35:18,690 --> 02:35:19,810
Looking right now.

4469
02:35:20,270 --> 02:35:21,510
I have a repeater and a peacekeeper.

4470
02:35:21,690 --> 02:35:22,010
So...

4471
02:35:22,730 --> 02:35:23,610
Not too great.

4472
02:35:25,970 --> 02:35:27,390
Scan this right side.

4473
02:35:27,590 --> 02:35:28,550
I'm gonna look left.

4474
02:35:29,810 --> 02:35:31,610
I'll hug this wall and scan.

4475
02:35:31,990 --> 02:35:34,830
If no one's on right, take space on the right.

4476
02:35:34,890 --> 02:35:35,910
And I'm just taking...

4477
02:35:36,690 --> 02:35:37,730
I think he's on the left as well.

4478
02:35:39,030 --> 02:35:41,130
I didn't seem to scan anybody.

4479
02:35:41,310 --> 02:35:41,630
Alright.

4480
02:35:43,110 --> 02:35:43,750
I'm in.

4481
02:35:43,810 --> 02:35:44,810
I'm in zone here too.

4482
02:35:45,210 --> 02:35:46,490
I'm watching our back too.

4483
02:35:46,630 --> 02:35:46,810
Yeah.

4484
02:35:46,830 --> 02:35:47,450
I'm gonna look.

4485
02:35:48,250 --> 02:35:51,390
If there's a team behind us, just posture up to fight.

4486
02:35:51,690 --> 02:35:52,090
Yeah.

4487
02:35:52,090 --> 02:35:52,150
Yeah.

4488
02:35:52,170 --> 02:35:53,410
You're on repeater.

4489
02:35:53,430 --> 02:35:54,070
You should be able to.

4490
02:35:54,590 --> 02:35:56,190
Do you think we can get that Evo or nah?

4491
02:35:57,690 --> 02:35:58,090
Guys.

4492
02:35:58,230 --> 02:35:58,530
We can.

4493
02:35:58,650 --> 02:35:58,890
We can.

4494
02:35:58,930 --> 02:35:59,130
We can.

4495
02:35:59,210 --> 02:36:00,650
I got 84 damage.

4496
02:36:01,310 --> 02:36:02,050
Oh my god.

4497
02:36:02,410 --> 02:36:02,810
Improvement.

4498
02:36:02,870 --> 02:36:03,110
Nice.

4499
02:36:03,890 --> 02:36:05,450
Just someone watch behind us.

4500
02:36:05,490 --> 02:36:05,710
Yeah.

4501
02:36:05,710 --> 02:36:06,010
I'm watching.

4502
02:36:06,010 --> 02:36:06,290
I'm watching.

4503
02:36:06,370 --> 02:36:07,650
Someone walks up.

4504
02:36:07,770 --> 02:36:08,130
Yeah.

4505
02:36:08,210 --> 02:36:09,370
I'm watching behind for us.

4506
02:36:09,450 --> 02:36:09,850
Yeah.

4507
02:36:09,850 --> 02:36:10,270
Ty.

4508
02:36:10,310 --> 02:36:10,770
You can look behind.

4509
02:36:11,070 --> 02:36:11,870
I can look behind.

4510
02:36:12,950 --> 02:36:13,430
Oh shit.

4511
02:36:15,530 --> 02:36:16,970
You're not in a bad spot.

4512
02:36:17,270 --> 02:36:18,610
On that height here.

4513
02:36:19,050 --> 02:36:20,070
We have re-deployers?

4514
02:36:20,110 --> 02:36:20,970
We have a re-deploy.

4515
02:36:22,490 --> 02:36:22,970
Yeah.

4516
02:36:23,210 --> 02:36:25,910
Where the fuck did that team go behind us?

4517
02:36:26,310 --> 02:36:26,790
They're moving.

4518
02:36:26,790 --> 02:36:28,130
They ran to the other side.

4519
02:36:29,590 --> 02:36:30,410
Where are they going?

4520
02:36:30,410 --> 02:36:31,790
There's a team there though.

4521
02:36:31,890 --> 02:36:33,750
There's a team playing this like house.

4522
02:36:35,370 --> 02:36:36,290
Where are we in?

4523
02:36:36,570 --> 02:36:37,570
We're in right here.

4524
02:36:37,770 --> 02:36:38,270
On that rock.

4525
02:36:38,390 --> 02:36:38,910
Oh you're purple.

4526
02:36:40,870 --> 02:36:41,670
Hold on.

4527
02:36:41,750 --> 02:36:42,870
Keep watching our back.

4528
02:36:42,990 --> 02:36:44,450
I'm gonna scout in front.

4529
02:36:44,590 --> 02:36:46,050
To see like where we can play.

4530
02:36:46,390 --> 02:36:46,630
Yeah.

4531
02:36:46,650 --> 02:36:48,350
I don't think there's anybody in zone at all.

4532
02:36:49,370 --> 02:36:51,290
I'm looking at the right side just in case.

4533
02:36:51,610 --> 02:36:53,650
The people in front of us were a Watton squad.

4534
02:36:53,850 --> 02:36:55,210
So if you see the same.

4535
02:36:55,250 --> 02:36:55,470
Oh yeah.

4536
02:36:56,130 --> 02:36:58,330
It's a Watson Newcastle over there.

4537
02:36:58,390 --> 02:37:00,390
Just fucking killing in the cross.

4538
02:37:00,410 --> 02:37:00,690
I'm a foreigner.

4539
02:37:03,230 --> 02:37:05,270
There's no one to our right at the moment.

4540
02:37:06,050 --> 02:37:06,870
We have a spot.

4541
02:37:06,950 --> 02:37:07,170
Okay.

4542
02:37:07,210 --> 02:37:08,050
We have like...

4543
02:37:09,230 --> 02:37:10,250
decent spot to play.

4544
02:37:10,310 --> 02:37:12,070
I'm heading over here.

4545
02:37:12,150 --> 02:37:13,010
Let me just confirm it.

4546
02:37:13,130 --> 02:37:13,970
Oh they're about to fight.

4547
02:37:16,290 --> 02:37:17,590
I'm looking at our backs just in case.

4548
02:37:17,930 --> 02:37:18,250
Wait.

4549
02:37:18,310 --> 02:37:18,510
Okay.

4550
02:37:18,570 --> 02:37:18,730
Okay.

4551
02:37:18,750 --> 02:37:20,370
We're gonna chill right here.

4552
02:37:20,430 --> 02:37:21,070
On this zone.

4553
02:37:21,150 --> 02:37:21,470
Wait.

4554
02:37:23,550 --> 02:37:24,690
Can I move from the left?

4555
02:37:24,690 --> 02:37:25,190
We're ratting right here.

4556
02:37:25,750 --> 02:37:26,070
Yeah.

4557
02:37:26,930 --> 02:37:27,430
You should.

4558
02:37:27,890 --> 02:37:28,210
Yeah.

4559
02:37:28,250 --> 02:37:29,170
We don't want to give presence.

4560
02:37:33,890 --> 02:37:34,990
There's a team here.

4561
02:37:35,190 --> 02:37:37,090
Like the team playing the building probably.

4562
02:37:37,250 --> 02:37:39,310
And this is the Watson team playing in the corner.

4563
02:37:40,250 --> 02:37:41,110
They saw us.

4564
02:37:41,110 --> 02:37:41,790
They saw us.

4565
02:37:42,150 --> 02:37:43,670
Come to my side.

4566
02:37:43,830 --> 02:37:44,130
It's fine.

4567
02:37:44,210 --> 02:37:44,470
It's fine.

4568
02:37:44,610 --> 02:37:45,350
We have cover here.

4569
02:37:45,730 --> 02:37:46,970
Lots of fucking cover.

4570
02:37:47,050 --> 02:37:47,950
This team can't walk up.

4571
02:37:48,030 --> 02:37:49,050
Like this team can't walk up.

4572
02:37:49,090 --> 02:37:50,610
Because they're just gonna get shot by this team.

4573
02:37:50,830 --> 02:37:51,990
I'm looking at this team right now.

4574
02:37:52,130 --> 02:37:53,930
Since they saw us already anyways.

4575
02:37:54,210 --> 02:37:54,870
Stay there.

4576
02:37:54,950 --> 02:37:55,630
Stay there on the height.

4577
02:37:56,050 --> 02:37:57,430
I'll look at the left side first.

4578
02:37:57,430 --> 02:37:59,390
Keep watching this team on the left.

4579
02:37:59,390 --> 02:37:59,430
Yeah.

4580
02:37:59,630 --> 02:38:00,530
I'm looking left.

4581
02:38:01,450 --> 02:38:04,090
I'm gonna make sure they don't fucking...

4582
02:38:04,090 --> 02:38:04,450
fucking...

4583
02:38:05,230 --> 02:38:06,390
rap us here.

4584
02:38:10,260 --> 02:38:11,240
Let me shoot.

4585
02:38:12,160 --> 02:38:12,640
Whoa.

4586
02:38:13,080 --> 02:38:13,560
Okay.

4587
02:38:14,300 --> 02:38:15,220
I heal.

4588
02:38:15,700 --> 02:38:16,180
Whoa.

4589
02:38:16,340 --> 02:38:17,100
I heal.

4590
02:38:18,980 --> 02:38:19,760
Is there...

4591
02:38:19,760 --> 02:38:22,480
Can you like move up on the left side somehow?

4592
02:38:22,700 --> 02:38:23,580
Is there like a cover?

4593
02:38:23,580 --> 02:38:24,020
We get zoned.

4594
02:38:24,140 --> 02:38:24,340
No.

4595
02:38:24,420 --> 02:38:25,160
I don't think so.

4596
02:38:25,600 --> 02:38:26,920
The cover's not gonna best.

4597
02:38:27,300 --> 02:38:28,180
I'm gonna stay to the right.

4598
02:38:28,220 --> 02:38:28,320
Oh.

4599
02:38:28,320 --> 02:38:29,220
They're rocketing us.

4600
02:38:29,220 --> 02:38:29,320
No.

4601
02:38:29,320 --> 02:38:29,840
There's no cover.

4602
02:38:29,840 --> 02:38:29,840
No.

4603
02:38:29,840 --> 02:38:30,000
No.

4604
02:38:30,020 --> 02:38:30,500
I was looking.

4605
02:38:30,600 --> 02:38:30,780
Yeah.

4606
02:38:30,780 --> 02:38:31,180
There's no cover.

4607
02:38:31,440 --> 02:38:32,240
Let me just play here.

4608
02:38:32,780 --> 02:38:33,140
Alright.

4609
02:38:33,200 --> 02:38:33,900
We can fly too.

4610
02:38:34,320 --> 02:38:34,680
Yeah.

4611
02:38:34,780 --> 02:38:34,960
Yeah.

4612
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:35,120
Yeah.

4613
02:38:35,340 --> 02:38:36,760
We have to read the play as well.

4614
02:38:36,880 --> 02:38:37,440
We have to read the play as well.

4615
02:38:38,880 --> 02:38:39,240
Ouch.

4616
02:38:39,560 --> 02:38:39,820
Ouch.

4617
02:38:40,300 --> 02:38:41,420
How many bats do you guys have?

4618
02:38:41,640 --> 02:38:43,380
I have... This team's getting shot on the right.

4619
02:38:43,620 --> 02:38:43,960
I have two.

4620
02:38:43,960 --> 02:38:44,420
They're getting pushed.

4621
02:38:44,540 --> 02:38:45,840
This Watson team's getting pushed right now.

4622
02:38:45,840 --> 02:38:46,180
Okay.

4623
02:38:46,180 --> 02:38:46,300
Okay.

4624
02:38:46,660 --> 02:38:47,420
I need a bat.

4625
02:38:47,480 --> 02:38:47,800
I need a bat.

4626
02:38:50,260 --> 02:38:51,020
What the fuck?

4627
02:38:51,020 --> 02:38:52,580
I'm gonna scan in front of me just in case.

4628
02:38:54,800 --> 02:38:55,160
Alright.

4629
02:38:55,240 --> 02:38:55,380
Yeah.

4630
02:38:55,400 --> 02:38:55,980
I think... Yeah.

4631
02:38:57,020 --> 02:38:58,340
I'm five cells one bat.

4632
02:38:59,220 --> 02:38:59,780
I'm gaming.

4633
02:38:59,940 --> 02:39:00,620
I have ten damage.

4634
02:39:01,120 --> 02:39:03,240
Are they still... Is the Watson team still there on the right?

4635
02:39:03,260 --> 02:39:03,440
Yeah.

4636
02:39:03,460 --> 02:39:03,540
Yeah.

4637
02:39:03,580 --> 02:39:03,680
Yeah.

4638
02:39:03,680 --> 02:39:03,940
Yeah.

4639
02:39:03,940 --> 02:39:04,420
Looks like it.

4640
02:39:05,420 --> 02:39:06,640
There's a team right here I'm ping.

4641
02:39:09,920 --> 02:39:10,240
I see it.

4642
02:39:10,440 --> 02:39:11,560
This one's hard.

4643
02:39:12,080 --> 02:39:13,420
I ain't even finna lie.

4644
02:39:15,040 --> 02:39:15,840
I mean we could read the play.

4645
02:39:15,840 --> 02:39:16,240
I have no way.

4646
02:39:17,200 --> 02:39:17,840
Back here.

4647
02:39:17,940 --> 02:39:18,120
Yeah.

4648
02:39:18,120 --> 02:39:18,680
We could like...

4649
02:39:18,680 --> 02:39:21,400
We could like valk from where I am and like look around.

4650
02:39:24,340 --> 02:39:24,660
Or valk them.

4651
02:39:24,660 --> 02:39:24,660
Wait.

4652
02:39:24,720 --> 02:39:25,280
They just rest.

4653
02:39:25,460 --> 02:39:25,620
Wait.

4654
02:39:25,620 --> 02:39:26,040
What the fuck?

4655
02:39:26,060 --> 02:39:27,020
There's a team right here I'm ping.

4656
02:39:27,560 --> 02:39:29,100
I don't know if that's the same team but...

4657
02:39:29,560 --> 02:39:31,120
That like got a better angle.

4658
02:39:31,260 --> 02:39:31,380
Yeah.

4659
02:39:31,380 --> 02:39:31,400
Come on.

4660
02:39:31,460 --> 02:39:31,500
I'm watching.

4661
02:39:32,680 --> 02:39:33,880
But they're definitely not from there.

4662
02:39:33,880 --> 02:39:35,640
I'm swinging right to...

4663
02:39:36,900 --> 02:39:37,260
Yeah.

4664
02:39:37,340 --> 02:39:37,420
Yeah.

4665
02:39:37,440 --> 02:39:37,940
There's a team.

4666
02:39:38,180 --> 02:39:39,560
That's a different team over there then.

4667
02:39:40,140 --> 02:39:41,420
Why aren't they shooting each other?

4668
02:39:42,020 --> 02:39:42,620
The fuck?

4669
02:39:44,160 --> 02:39:44,520
No.

4670
02:39:44,620 --> 02:39:45,100
They're teaming.

4671
02:39:45,680 --> 02:39:46,520
They're teaming bro.

4672
02:39:47,920 --> 02:39:49,000
I'm moving up to the tree.

4673
02:39:49,120 --> 02:39:49,380
Buds!

4674
02:39:50,320 --> 02:39:51,060
Did they leave?

4675
02:39:53,080 --> 02:39:53,600
They left.

4676
02:39:53,600 --> 02:39:54,120
They came to the left.

4677
02:39:54,220 --> 02:39:55,280
We can flank this team I think.

4678
02:39:55,740 --> 02:39:56,040
Alright.

4679
02:39:56,080 --> 02:39:56,740
I'm coming to you.

4680
02:39:56,800 --> 02:39:58,060
Should we rotate to your east?

4681
02:39:58,160 --> 02:39:58,300
Oh no.

4682
02:39:58,420 --> 02:39:59,240
They're still there.

4683
02:39:59,340 --> 02:39:59,800
They're still there.

4684
02:39:59,860 --> 02:40:00,040
Nah.

4685
02:40:00,120 --> 02:40:00,320
Nah.

4686
02:40:00,360 --> 02:40:00,580
Nah.

4687
02:40:00,580 --> 02:40:00,720
Nah.

4688
02:40:01,900 --> 02:40:03,080
We have 14 seconds.

4689
02:40:04,100 --> 02:40:05,240
I think we have to fly.

4690
02:40:05,620 --> 02:40:05,920
Alright.

4691
02:40:06,020 --> 02:40:07,400
This is the best cover I think.

4692
02:40:07,480 --> 02:40:07,740
Right?

4693
02:40:08,380 --> 02:40:08,980
Oh no.

4694
02:40:09,080 --> 02:40:09,400
There's people.

4695
02:40:09,680 --> 02:40:10,520
We just fly.

4696
02:40:11,140 --> 02:40:12,240
Come to my side.

4697
02:40:12,240 --> 02:40:12,840
Come to my side.

4698
02:40:12,840 --> 02:40:13,640
And we fly right here.

4699
02:40:15,500 --> 02:40:16,300
Right here?

4700
02:40:16,440 --> 02:40:16,980
I'm flying?

4701
02:40:17,140 --> 02:40:17,240
Yeah.

4702
02:40:18,360 --> 02:40:18,880
I'm here.

4703
02:40:19,660 --> 02:40:20,060
Alright.

4704
02:40:20,100 --> 02:40:20,520
There we go.

4705
02:40:20,700 --> 02:40:21,440
We got ping for injuries.

4706
02:40:21,440 --> 02:40:21,860
Just look around.

4707
02:40:22,080 --> 02:40:22,680
We have a tree.

4708
02:40:22,840 --> 02:40:24,560
We have like little trees here.

4709
02:40:24,980 --> 02:40:26,960
Fly like towards here on the left.

4710
02:40:27,760 --> 02:40:28,160
Ummm.

4711
02:40:30,580 --> 02:40:31,140
Keep flying.

4712
02:40:31,280 --> 02:40:31,900
Keep flying.

4713
02:40:33,900 --> 02:40:34,620
The house is taken?

4714
02:40:35,080 --> 02:40:35,360
Land.

4715
02:40:35,360 --> 02:40:36,220
Land on the second floor.

4716
02:40:36,280 --> 02:40:36,900
Land on the second floor.

4717
02:40:36,920 --> 02:40:37,600
Land on the second floor.

4718
02:40:37,700 --> 02:40:38,480
We're gonna fight the second floor.

4719
02:40:38,580 --> 02:40:39,220
I'm gonna go in the door.

4720
02:40:39,240 --> 02:40:39,860
I'm gonna go in the door.

4721
02:40:40,080 --> 02:40:40,700
No one's here.

4722
02:40:42,040 --> 02:40:42,560
That's our house.

4723
02:40:42,620 --> 02:40:43,100
Our new house.

4724
02:40:43,140 --> 02:40:43,560
Our new house.

4725
02:40:43,820 --> 02:40:44,700
Come to the second floor.

4726
02:40:45,860 --> 02:40:46,140
Yes.

4727
02:40:46,140 --> 02:40:46,420
Yes.

4728
02:40:46,580 --> 02:40:46,860
Okay.

4729
02:40:47,800 --> 02:40:48,500
This door is open.

4730
02:40:48,740 --> 02:40:49,020
Yes.

4731
02:40:49,280 --> 02:40:49,700
It's fine.

4732
02:40:49,760 --> 02:40:50,080
It's fine.

4733
02:40:50,120 --> 02:40:50,820
We have a house.

4734
02:40:51,860 --> 02:40:52,900
We still have a door here.

4735
02:40:53,020 --> 02:40:54,340
I'm chilling on this door.

4736
02:40:54,600 --> 02:40:54,680
Yeah.

4737
02:40:54,860 --> 02:40:55,140
Wait.

4738
02:40:55,400 --> 02:40:56,060
Somebody's knocked.

4739
02:40:57,160 --> 02:40:57,880
You see that?

4740
02:40:58,100 --> 02:40:58,140
Wait.

4741
02:40:58,140 --> 02:40:58,460
Someone's knocked.

4742
02:40:58,960 --> 02:40:59,780
I'm gonna peek alone.

4743
02:40:59,920 --> 02:41:00,300
I'm gonna peek alone.

4744
02:41:00,300 --> 02:41:00,500
Okay.

4745
02:41:00,500 --> 02:41:00,680
Okay.

4746
02:41:00,840 --> 02:41:00,840
Okay.

4747
02:41:00,840 --> 02:41:01,060
Here is.

4748
02:41:01,560 --> 02:41:02,460
Don't let your East die.

4749
02:41:02,820 --> 02:41:03,680
Protect your East.

4750
02:41:05,280 --> 02:41:05,600
Okay.

4751
02:41:05,620 --> 02:41:05,780
Okay.

4752
02:41:05,840 --> 02:41:06,300
We're just chill.

4753
02:41:06,360 --> 02:41:06,720
We're just chill.

4754
02:41:06,780 --> 02:41:07,420
Don't do too much.

4755
02:41:07,520 --> 02:41:08,520
If we hear them resing.

4756
02:41:08,580 --> 02:41:10,200
If we hear them resing.

4757
02:41:10,200 --> 02:41:11,780
We peek but don't commit to the first floor.

4758
02:41:11,920 --> 02:41:12,660
I can scan in two.

4759
02:41:12,760 --> 02:41:13,320
I'll scan again.

4760
02:41:14,400 --> 02:41:14,720
Oh.

4761
02:41:14,740 --> 02:41:15,100
We have zone.

4762
02:41:15,320 --> 02:41:15,480
Oh.

4763
02:41:15,500 --> 02:41:15,580
No.

4764
02:41:15,580 --> 02:41:15,860
They res.

4765
02:41:15,900 --> 02:41:16,220
They res.

4766
02:41:16,220 --> 02:41:16,420
They res.

4767
02:41:16,480 --> 02:41:16,720
They res.

4768
02:41:17,400 --> 02:41:17,720
No.

4769
02:41:17,900 --> 02:41:18,220
No.

4770
02:41:18,220 --> 02:41:19,060
She's still knocked right there.

4771
02:41:19,440 --> 02:41:19,760
Wait.

4772
02:41:20,500 --> 02:41:20,820
What?

4773
02:41:21,940 --> 02:41:22,220
No.

4774
02:41:22,320 --> 02:41:22,980
I'm pretty sure there's three.

4775
02:41:23,540 --> 02:41:23,860
No.

4776
02:41:23,860 --> 02:41:24,300
There was four.

4777
02:41:24,400 --> 02:41:25,360
I scanned four people.

4778
02:41:26,060 --> 02:41:26,060
Okay.

4779
02:41:26,060 --> 02:41:28,520
That's different team knocked then.

4780
02:41:28,580 --> 02:41:28,740
Yeah.

4781
02:41:28,940 --> 02:41:30,000
I'll scan again in four.

4782
02:41:30,040 --> 02:41:30,340
Makes sense.

4783
02:41:31,360 --> 02:41:32,220
I'll scan in four.

4784
02:41:33,560 --> 02:41:35,820
We're in zone.

4785
02:41:36,100 --> 02:41:36,220
Yeah.

4786
02:41:36,260 --> 02:41:36,400
See.

4787
02:41:36,440 --> 02:41:36,760
You see that?

4788
02:41:37,080 --> 02:41:37,980
What the fuck is that?

4789
02:41:38,100 --> 02:41:38,380
What the fuck?

4790
02:41:38,540 --> 02:41:40,980
What the fuck is that guy?

4791
02:41:44,600 --> 02:41:44,960
Me.

4792
02:41:44,960 --> 02:41:45,900
On the guy in the back.

4793
02:41:46,980 --> 02:41:47,540
I'm looking.

4794
02:41:47,640 --> 02:41:48,900
Just make sure we're not getting climbed up on.

4795
02:41:48,900 --> 02:41:49,600
I cracked too.

4796
02:41:49,900 --> 02:41:50,260
Yeah.

4797
02:41:52,540 --> 02:41:52,900
Oh.

4798
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:53,900
I think they killed him.

4799
02:41:54,080 --> 02:41:54,440
Yeah.

4800
02:41:54,540 --> 02:41:55,080
I'm trying it.

4801
02:41:56,320 --> 02:41:56,720
Yeah.

4802
02:41:56,780 --> 02:41:57,460
They got him.

4803
02:41:57,480 --> 02:41:57,600
Wait.

4804
02:41:57,680 --> 02:41:58,060
What?

4805
02:41:58,280 --> 02:41:58,680
Oh.

4806
02:41:58,720 --> 02:41:59,260
They're above us.

4807
02:41:59,280 --> 02:41:59,640
They're above.

4808
02:41:59,780 --> 02:42:00,780
What is that corner?

4809
02:42:01,160 --> 02:42:02,480
That is an insane corner.

4810
02:42:02,660 --> 02:42:03,440
I think they're gonna drop.

4811
02:42:03,780 --> 02:42:07,240
If this team drops, we play behind right here.

4812
02:42:07,320 --> 02:42:07,500
Okay?

4813
02:42:07,620 --> 02:42:07,960
Okay.

4814
02:42:07,960 --> 02:42:08,040
Okay.

4815
02:42:08,040 --> 02:42:10,120
And we're gonna watch a fucking angle.

4816
02:42:10,180 --> 02:42:11,180
They're peeking us.

4817
02:42:11,300 --> 02:42:12,100
They can't get in.

4818
02:42:12,200 --> 02:42:14,200
Throw your like thermites in these as well.

4819
02:42:14,680 --> 02:42:15,480
I knocked one.

4820
02:42:16,120 --> 02:42:16,520
Nice.

4821
02:42:16,940 --> 02:42:19,200
I kept hacking Newcastle res.

4822
02:42:19,660 --> 02:42:20,060
Uh.

4823
02:42:25,460 --> 02:42:26,820
There's people up top there too.

4824
02:42:26,820 --> 02:42:27,820
Watch out for that angle.

4825
02:42:28,540 --> 02:42:29,320
They're all up top.

4826
02:42:29,380 --> 02:42:30,040
There's no one below us.

4827
02:42:30,040 --> 02:42:31,000
I'm gonna bang ult on this zone close.

4828
02:42:32,800 --> 02:42:33,560
Look at this tire.

4829
02:42:34,020 --> 02:42:34,940
You hit this tire.

4830
02:42:35,140 --> 02:42:35,420
Left.

4831
02:42:35,500 --> 02:42:35,860
West.

4832
02:42:35,900 --> 02:42:36,080
West.

4833
02:42:36,240 --> 02:42:36,900
I'm looking at right.

4834
02:42:38,200 --> 02:42:39,860
I don't see anything.

4835
02:42:40,060 --> 02:42:40,720
I'm bang ulting now.

4836
02:42:40,860 --> 02:42:41,200
Wait.

4837
02:42:41,840 --> 02:42:43,540
There's a team below us now.

4838
02:42:43,700 --> 02:42:46,560
I can scan in.

4839
02:42:47,060 --> 02:42:47,980
I'm bang ulting.

4840
02:42:48,120 --> 02:42:48,420
I'm bang ulting.

4841
02:42:50,180 --> 02:42:51,060
Oh my god.

4842
02:42:51,080 --> 02:42:51,220
Wait.

4843
02:42:51,220 --> 02:42:52,660
There's a huge fight to our left.

4844
02:42:54,860 --> 02:42:55,720
Huge fight to our left.

4845
02:42:55,740 --> 02:42:56,300
I smoked our right.

4846
02:42:58,660 --> 02:43:00,240
I hit someone for flash.

4847
02:43:00,480 --> 02:43:01,240
I didn't take anyone.

4848
02:43:01,380 --> 02:43:02,140
I hit someone on the right.

4849
02:43:02,640 --> 02:43:04,140
I'm gonna look height.

4850
02:43:04,240 --> 02:43:04,760
I'm gonna look height.

4851
02:43:04,840 --> 02:43:05,480
Before they drop.

4852
02:43:07,260 --> 02:43:08,420
I'm looking up right here maybe.

4853
02:43:08,660 --> 02:43:09,380
They might drop.

4854
02:43:10,220 --> 02:43:10,580
Scanning?

4855
02:43:12,120 --> 02:43:13,940
It's just one team below us.

4856
02:43:13,940 --> 02:43:14,300
Just one team.

4857
02:43:14,720 --> 02:43:15,680
No one's on height, huh?

4858
02:43:16,020 --> 02:43:16,380
Yeah.

4859
02:43:16,460 --> 02:43:17,400
I didn't scan anybody.

4860
02:43:17,500 --> 02:43:19,840
I'm not sure if my scan didn't pick it up or anything.

4861
02:43:20,220 --> 02:43:20,600
I'm not sure if my scan didn't pick it up or anything.

4862
02:43:20,680 --> 02:43:21,660
Does anyone have a bat?

4863
02:43:23,180 --> 02:43:23,540
Yeah.

4864
02:43:25,720 --> 02:43:27,960
I'm looking at these guys right now.

4865
02:43:28,100 --> 02:43:28,460
I'm looking at these guys right now.

4866
02:43:28,460 --> 02:43:29,200
I have a nice scan here.

4867
02:43:32,600 --> 02:43:32,960
Yeah.

4868
02:43:32,960 --> 02:43:34,180
It's just one team below us.

4869
02:43:35,220 --> 02:43:35,940
Six hostiles?

4870
02:43:36,140 --> 02:43:36,820
Who the fuck are they?

4871
02:43:37,040 --> 02:43:37,980
There's still a team on height.

4872
02:43:38,300 --> 02:43:38,480
Yeah.

4873
02:43:38,580 --> 02:43:39,620
They're all the way up there.

4874
02:43:39,960 --> 02:43:42,020
I was like, where the fuck did I get six?

4875
02:43:49,420 --> 02:43:50,660
I don't have a lot of ammo.

4876
02:43:51,440 --> 02:43:52,900
Do you guys have extra light or no?

4877
02:43:53,620 --> 02:43:54,260
No light.

4878
02:43:54,440 --> 02:43:54,620
Okay.

4879
02:43:54,660 --> 02:43:56,280
I'm gonna run 12 now then.

4880
02:43:57,680 --> 02:44:00,300
I think you can play on the height with me.

4881
02:44:00,500 --> 02:44:00,960
I think you can play on the height with me.

4882
02:44:00,960 --> 02:44:01,360
One of you.

4883
02:44:01,740 --> 02:44:04,120
I think Taya should play height then.

4884
02:44:06,220 --> 02:44:08,280
We have like a little roof here, Taya.

4885
02:44:09,480 --> 02:44:09,920
Yeah.

4886
02:44:10,020 --> 02:44:10,200
Yeah.

4887
02:44:10,760 --> 02:44:11,640
I'm watching height.

4888
02:44:11,960 --> 02:44:12,780
Just make sure.

4889
02:44:12,820 --> 02:44:14,360
Just so we don't get climbed up on.

4890
02:44:14,560 --> 02:44:16,600
Watch these little...

4891
02:44:16,600 --> 02:44:17,880
Look at this.

4892
02:44:17,880 --> 02:44:18,400
Look at this.

4893
02:44:18,800 --> 02:44:19,560
There's the evac.

4894
02:44:20,140 --> 02:44:20,800
Look at the evac.

4895
02:44:21,500 --> 02:44:21,940
Scanning.

4896
02:44:23,280 --> 02:44:23,880
There you go.

4897
02:44:26,180 --> 02:44:27,140
There's a team up.

4898
02:44:27,420 --> 02:44:27,780
There's a team up.

4899
02:44:27,780 --> 02:44:28,180
Jumping down.

4900
02:44:28,220 --> 02:44:28,600
Jumping down.

4901
02:44:30,420 --> 02:44:30,940
I'm covering.

4902
02:44:31,080 --> 02:44:31,220
I'm covering.

4903
02:44:31,720 --> 02:44:32,140
I'm dropping.

4904
02:44:32,260 --> 02:44:32,500
I'm dropping.

4905
02:44:34,360 --> 02:44:35,380
Oh my god.

4906
02:44:35,400 --> 02:44:36,120
I'm so scared.

4907
02:44:36,200 --> 02:44:37,360
I saw that guy run up to you.

4908
02:44:37,560 --> 02:44:38,180
Holy shit.

4909
02:44:40,260 --> 02:44:41,000
I'm watching this.

4910
02:44:41,080 --> 02:44:41,800
I'm watching this team.

4911
02:44:42,300 --> 02:44:43,580
We have to get out of this.

4912
02:44:43,660 --> 02:44:44,340
They're running out.

4913
02:44:44,380 --> 02:44:44,680
Running out.

4914
02:44:44,680 --> 02:44:45,700
There's a team on a roof.

4915
02:44:47,840 --> 02:44:48,720
On a roof?

4916
02:44:48,920 --> 02:44:49,260
Yeah.

4917
02:44:49,320 --> 02:44:50,000
I'm fucking scanning.

4918
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:50,780
I'm gonna ult this.

4919
02:44:52,480 --> 02:44:53,640
A full team on a roof.

4920
02:44:57,480 --> 02:44:59,080
We have to leave soon because of zone.

4921
02:44:59,200 --> 02:44:59,560
Oh that's you.

4922
02:44:59,560 --> 02:45:00,020
I knocked one on height.

4923
02:45:00,100 --> 02:45:00,600
I knocked one on height.

4924
02:45:01,500 --> 02:45:01,860
I'm killing.

4925
02:45:01,860 --> 02:45:01,860
I'm killing.

4926
02:45:01,860 --> 02:45:02,180
I can scan in two.

4927
02:45:05,040 --> 02:45:05,680
I'm on height with you.

4928
02:45:07,940 --> 02:45:08,680
I got one.

4929
02:45:08,780 --> 02:45:08,860
Yeah.

4930
02:45:08,920 --> 02:45:09,060
Full.

4931
02:45:09,100 --> 02:45:09,220
Full.

4932
02:45:09,220 --> 02:45:09,320
Full dead.

4933
02:45:09,720 --> 02:45:10,000
Nice.

4934
02:45:10,200 --> 02:45:10,380
Nice.

4935
02:45:10,420 --> 02:45:10,580
Nice.

4936
02:45:10,580 --> 02:45:10,700
Nice.

4937
02:45:10,980 --> 02:45:11,520
I'm looking down.

4938
02:45:11,600 --> 02:45:11,900
I'm looking down.

4939
02:45:11,920 --> 02:45:12,100
Here.

4940
02:45:12,180 --> 02:45:12,280
Here.

4941
02:45:12,280 --> 02:45:12,400
Here.

4942
02:45:12,580 --> 02:45:13,480
There's people to our left.

4943
02:45:13,520 --> 02:45:14,280
People to our left too.

4944
02:45:14,360 --> 02:45:14,520
I'm looking.

4945
02:45:14,600 --> 02:45:14,700
I'm looking.

4946
02:45:16,300 --> 02:45:17,440
Oh that Bangalore is one.

4947
02:45:17,660 --> 02:45:17,820
Nice.

4948
02:45:17,820 --> 02:45:18,000
Nice.

4949
02:45:18,020 --> 02:45:18,180
Nice.

4950
02:45:18,180 --> 02:45:18,340
Nice.

4951
02:45:18,520 --> 02:45:18,800
Wait.

4952
02:45:18,880 --> 02:45:19,040
Left.

4953
02:45:19,120 --> 02:45:19,300
Left.

4954
02:45:19,300 --> 02:45:19,460
Left.

4955
02:45:19,460 --> 02:45:19,720
Look left.

4956
02:45:19,840 --> 02:45:20,040
Look left.

4957
02:45:23,200 --> 02:45:23,480
Wait.

4958
02:45:23,580 --> 02:45:24,540
We gotta go down to the second floor.

4959
02:45:24,580 --> 02:45:24,920
Second floor.

4960
02:45:24,940 --> 02:45:25,140
Second floor.

4961
02:45:26,540 --> 02:45:27,460
I can't go down.

4962
02:45:27,620 --> 02:45:27,740
I'm batting.

4963
02:45:27,740 --> 02:45:28,020
I'm batting.

4964
02:45:28,040 --> 02:45:28,700
I'm bombing a med kit.

4965
02:45:28,740 --> 02:45:29,220
I'm bombing a med kit.

4966
02:45:30,740 --> 02:45:31,340
I'm gonna fly.

4967
02:45:31,440 --> 02:45:31,680

4968
02:45:31,740 --> 02:45:31,960
Wait.

4969
02:45:32,020 --> 02:45:32,400
Should I fly?

4970
02:45:34,260 --> 02:45:35,180
We got an ape left.

4971
02:45:35,280 --> 02:45:35,580
An ape left.

4972
02:45:35,640 --> 02:45:35,900
Ape left.

4973
02:45:36,440 --> 02:45:37,520
I'm gonna land on their heads.

4974
02:45:37,600 --> 02:45:37,740
Okay?

4975
02:45:38,920 --> 02:45:39,640
Oh I got some.

4976
02:45:39,660 --> 02:45:39,920
I got some.

4977
02:45:40,040 --> 02:45:40,540
I'm batting.

4978
02:45:40,560 --> 02:45:40,920
I'm batting.

4979
02:45:40,920 --> 02:45:41,440
I'm shooting and killing.

4980
02:45:42,300 --> 02:45:43,440
I'm gonna land on their heads.

4981
02:45:43,640 --> 02:45:43,840
Alright.

4982
02:45:43,880 --> 02:45:44,240
Pop a bat.

4983
02:45:44,280 --> 02:45:44,540
Pop a bat.

4984
02:45:44,600 --> 02:45:44,760
Ready?

4985
02:45:44,960 --> 02:45:45,240
Ready?

4986
02:45:45,900 --> 02:45:46,180
Gaping.

4987
02:45:46,340 --> 02:45:46,620
Gaping.

4988
02:45:46,640 --> 02:45:46,920
Gaping.

4989
02:45:48,360 --> 02:45:48,920
Going in?

4990
02:45:52,340 --> 02:45:52,660
No...

4991
02:45:54,220 --> 02:45:55,240
TAYO LIVE!

4992
02:45:55,520 --> 02:45:56,080
TAYO!

4993
02:45:56,460 --> 02:45:57,000
NOOOO!

4994
02:45:58,400 --> 02:45:59,120
NOOOO!

4995
02:46:00,760 --> 02:46:02,540
Fucking Newcastle bro.

4996
02:46:02,860 --> 02:46:04,020
The Newcastle!

4997
02:46:04,060 --> 02:46:06,640
We grieved the Newcastle team.

4998
02:46:06,860 --> 02:46:10,380
We got third though!

4999
02:46:10,500 --> 02:46:11,560
We got third!

5000
02:46:11,920 --> 02:46:12,600
We got third!

5001
02:46:12,640 --> 02:46:13,760
Bro that is insane!

5002
02:46:14,020 --> 02:46:15,160
You see this guys?

5003
02:46:15,400 --> 02:46:17,080
Look at us!

5004
02:46:17,980 --> 02:46:20,220
All odds against us.

5005
02:46:20,220 --> 02:46:21,020
Oh it's them again.

5006
02:46:21,380 --> 02:46:24,120
Bro just give them the money!

5007
02:46:25,340 --> 02:46:27,500
Just give them the money bro!

5008
02:46:28,380 --> 02:46:29,680
We need like...

5009
02:46:29,680 --> 02:46:30,640
Just like a beer.

5010
02:46:30,740 --> 02:46:31,340
Like we're done.

5011
02:46:31,540 --> 02:46:33,380
Let them sit out next game.

5012
02:46:33,420 --> 02:46:33,980
They already won.

5013
02:46:34,220 --> 02:46:36,580
There's no one fucking catching up.

5014
02:46:39,520 --> 02:46:40,820
That is insane.

5015
02:46:41,200 --> 02:46:42,320
That was actually a fun round.

5016
02:46:42,380 --> 02:46:43,400
Bro that was crazy.

5017
02:46:43,720 --> 02:46:44,220
Look at us.

5018
02:46:44,220 --> 02:46:46,020
Bro they have 17 kills!

5019
02:46:47,800 --> 02:46:50,200
Dude they killed everybody for us.

5020
02:46:50,220 --> 02:46:50,620
For us!

5021
02:46:52,620 --> 02:46:53,080
Wait...

5022
02:46:53,080 --> 02:46:54,460
I can't see my damage.

5023
02:46:54,620 --> 02:46:54,800
Fuck.

5024
02:46:54,960 --> 02:46:55,940
I thought I did a lot.

5025
02:46:56,120 --> 02:46:56,640
You did a thousand.

5026
02:46:56,800 --> 02:46:57,160
I saw it.

5027
02:46:57,180 --> 02:46:57,480
Don't worry.

5028
02:46:57,620 --> 02:46:58,120
I got you.

5029
02:46:58,580 --> 02:46:59,420
A thousand!

5030
02:46:59,660 --> 02:47:00,220
Thank you!

5031
02:47:00,800 --> 02:47:01,640
Apex gods!

5032
02:47:03,300 --> 02:47:04,100
That's a god.

5033
02:47:04,940 --> 02:47:05,580
That's a god.

5034
02:47:05,580 --> 02:47:06,460
Oh my god!

5035
02:47:07,220 --> 02:47:08,540
17 kills!

5036
02:47:08,980 --> 02:47:12,140
Bro we like knocked so many people but they kept getting res.

5037
02:47:12,380 --> 02:47:14,100
Yo what the fuck was that man?

5038
02:47:14,220 --> 02:47:14,820
We got robbed.

5039
02:47:15,100 --> 02:47:16,740
We got robbed of our kills.

5040
02:47:19,260 --> 02:47:19,780
Mods!

5041
02:47:20,700 --> 02:47:21,560
Mods come on!

5042
02:47:21,980 --> 02:47:22,760
Give us those points!

5043
02:47:22,760 --> 02:47:23,680
What's going on here?

5044
02:47:23,720 --> 02:47:24,020
Hello?

5045
02:47:24,360 --> 02:47:24,800
Yeah.

5046
02:47:26,140 --> 02:47:26,660
Scammed.

5047
02:47:27,120 --> 02:47:29,300
Nox should count us points.

5048
02:47:29,800 --> 02:47:30,200
Yeah.

5049
02:47:30,740 --> 02:47:31,620
Please Apex.

5050
02:47:33,040 --> 02:47:33,560
Please.

5051
02:47:33,560 --> 02:47:34,660
It should count.

5052
02:47:35,240 --> 02:47:36,320
That shit should count.

5053
02:47:37,180 --> 02:47:38,620
Oh is this the last round?

5054
02:47:38,820 --> 02:47:39,360
Yeah last game.

5055
02:47:39,380 --> 02:47:39,740
Round 6.

5056
02:47:40,160 --> 02:47:40,800
This is fun though.

5057
02:47:42,180 --> 02:47:44,840
Bro we could have played so high if I didn't get blue screened.

5058
02:47:46,600 --> 02:47:49,940
I actually feel like I got a good position too.

5059
02:47:50,200 --> 02:47:50,480
Yeah.

5060
02:47:50,740 --> 02:47:52,520
Yeah and I trust both of them.

5061
02:47:52,560 --> 02:47:55,120
We both play over so I trust both of our FPS skills.

5062
02:47:57,960 --> 02:47:59,100
Oh my god.

5063
02:48:02,260 --> 02:48:03,300
That was actually fun.

5064
02:48:03,540 --> 02:48:04,440
Yeah that was a good game.

5065
02:48:04,700 --> 02:48:05,820
World's Edge last game.

5066
02:48:06,060 --> 02:48:07,380
Same place.

5067
02:48:11,160 --> 02:48:12,000
Yup yup.

5068
02:48:13,760 --> 02:48:15,880
Apparently someone said they killed 7 teams.

5069
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:16,380
I don't know.

5070
02:48:16,400 --> 02:48:17,140
Jesus.

5071
02:48:17,300 --> 02:48:18,640
7 teams?

5072
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:20,960
Bro this guy killed 17.

5073
02:48:22,080 --> 02:48:24,300
Dude he's just a terminator.

5074
02:48:24,340 --> 02:48:25,520
You just never want to see him.

5075
02:48:25,820 --> 02:48:26,800
Bro put him on P20.

5076
02:48:28,480 --> 02:48:30,040
P20 nerf right now.

5077
02:48:31,600 --> 02:48:33,420
Yeah you should only be allowed to.

5078
02:48:33,620 --> 02:48:33,940
Yeah.

5079
02:48:34,460 --> 02:48:35,400
You should only.

5080
02:48:36,460 --> 02:48:37,060
Yeah.

5081
02:48:37,900 --> 02:48:39,660
You should get the P20 nerf.

5082
02:48:39,680 --> 02:48:40,140
No attachments.

5083
02:48:40,700 --> 02:48:42,200
He's probably better than me.

5084
02:48:42,360 --> 02:48:43,480
With the P20.

5085
02:48:44,380 --> 02:48:46,320
Yeah you have your fucking match.

5086
02:48:46,400 --> 02:48:47,080
With your PK.

5087
02:48:47,380 --> 02:48:50,520
And he still gets like 20 headshots.

5088
02:48:51,060 --> 02:48:51,220
Yeah.

5089
02:49:01,730 --> 02:49:02,250
Bro.

5090
02:49:02,430 --> 02:49:03,010
I'm scared.

5091
02:49:03,310 --> 02:49:04,530
I'm so scared to fight.

5092
02:49:04,650 --> 02:49:06,330
Fight team 20.

5093
02:49:06,350 --> 02:49:07,950
It might be team 20.

5094
02:49:08,290 --> 02:49:09,090
It's like you never know.

5095
02:49:09,450 --> 02:49:11,570
I want to know what the point gap is.

5096
02:49:12,190 --> 02:49:13,650
I'm actually so curious.

5097
02:49:14,110 --> 02:49:16,850
I think there's a limit to kill points.

5098
02:49:17,110 --> 02:49:18,110
Yeah but they got like.

5099
02:49:18,170 --> 02:49:21,370
They got 3 first places in the ranked.

5100
02:49:21,410 --> 02:49:22,710
3 first places.

5101
02:49:22,850 --> 02:49:23,590
That's true.

5102
02:49:24,830 --> 02:49:27,170
He didn't win the solo right?

5103
02:49:27,270 --> 02:49:28,070
Who won the solo?

5104
02:49:28,790 --> 02:49:30,090
Not you Cav no.

5105
02:49:30,230 --> 02:49:31,230
Who won the solo?

5106
02:49:31,610 --> 02:49:33,890
Who won the solo?

5107
02:49:34,370 --> 02:49:35,610
It was...

5108
02:49:36,530 --> 02:49:37,490
Oh Lyca.

5109
02:49:38,790 --> 02:49:39,530
Oh yeah.

5110
02:49:41,310 --> 02:49:42,850
Alright chat tell us.

5111
02:49:43,050 --> 02:49:45,190
Tell us like the first place team points.

5112
02:49:45,290 --> 02:49:46,590
And then the second place team points.

5113
02:49:46,710 --> 02:49:47,750
I'm actually so curious.

5114
02:49:49,270 --> 02:49:50,530
I'm so curious.

5115
02:49:50,530 --> 02:49:51,950
How far ahead they are.

5116
02:49:56,200 --> 02:49:57,160
That's insane.

5117
02:49:57,260 --> 02:49:58,520
That's such a strong lineup.

5118
02:50:03,450 --> 02:50:03,930
Alright.

5119
02:50:04,510 --> 02:50:05,310
We peaked.

5120
02:50:05,570 --> 02:50:07,590
You know it's because of that lockdown we did.

5121
02:50:09,770 --> 02:50:10,250
Yeah.

5122
02:50:10,290 --> 02:50:12,010
Yeah we were warmed up.

5123
02:50:12,230 --> 02:50:12,470
Yeah.

5124
02:50:13,610 --> 02:50:14,630
That's actually true.

5125
02:50:14,730 --> 02:50:18,390
We should have played lockdown in the beginning.

5126
02:50:19,450 --> 02:50:20,830
We should have done that.

5127
02:50:21,030 --> 02:50:21,390
Yeah.

5128
02:50:23,670 --> 02:50:24,490
Oh my god.

5129
02:50:24,550 --> 02:50:26,350
We could have been like thirds all the time.

5130
02:50:30,380 --> 02:50:30,860
Okay.

5131
02:50:30,940 --> 02:50:33,020
The next match will not have kill point limit.

5132
02:50:33,240 --> 02:50:34,720
Oh he's gonna fucking go wild.

5133
02:50:35,080 --> 02:50:37,620
Yeah he's gonna get like 21 on his own.

5134
02:50:37,780 --> 02:50:37,880
Yeah.

5135
02:50:39,540 --> 02:50:42,280
They drop off with solos.

5136
02:50:42,280 --> 02:50:43,100
All three go solos.

5137
02:50:43,840 --> 02:50:45,080
Yeah they're just different places.

5138
02:50:45,460 --> 02:50:45,860
Yeah.

5139
02:50:46,060 --> 02:50:48,020
They all go to different LAN sites.

5140
02:50:48,180 --> 02:50:48,620
POS.

5141
02:50:55,250 --> 02:50:56,210
Here we go.

5142
02:51:02,800 --> 02:51:04,140
How much is the...

5143
02:51:04,480 --> 02:51:04,940
Yeah.

5144
02:51:06,660 --> 02:51:10,440
Beacons now let you know where the enemy is instead of the next ring?

5145
02:51:10,660 --> 02:51:11,520
No no there's two.

5146
02:51:11,720 --> 02:51:12,300
There's two.

5147
02:51:12,740 --> 02:51:13,920
There's a ring console.

5148
02:51:14,260 --> 02:51:16,160
There's the ring and then there's the beacon.

5149
02:51:17,260 --> 02:51:17,680
Okay.

5150
02:51:18,660 --> 02:51:19,080
Yeah.

5151
02:51:19,260 --> 02:51:21,300
So it's like map room scan and ring scan.

5152
02:51:21,520 --> 02:51:23,260
We just don't have the character for map room.

5153
02:51:23,560 --> 02:51:24,380
Or not map room.

5154
02:51:24,440 --> 02:51:25,440
We don't have the character for ring.

5155
02:51:27,500 --> 02:51:28,260
So we just rely.

5156
02:51:28,260 --> 02:51:29,460
But we know where everyone else is going.

5157
02:51:29,600 --> 02:51:29,800
Yeah.

5158
02:51:29,800 --> 02:51:31,100
So it's pretty much the same thing.

5159
02:51:34,810 --> 02:51:37,890
I like how some of my chat is like team 20 is first, second and third.

5160
02:51:38,710 --> 02:51:39,190
Yeah.

5161
02:51:39,310 --> 02:51:39,790
Holy!

5162
02:51:39,930 --> 02:51:41,470
First is 63 points.

5163
02:51:41,590 --> 02:51:42,770
Second is 47.

5164
02:51:43,430 --> 02:51:44,250
Oh no.

5165
02:51:44,550 --> 02:51:45,470
Oh my god.

5166
02:51:45,530 --> 02:51:48,030
That's a... the gap is not as bad as I thought.

5167
02:51:48,470 --> 02:51:49,510
We're second right?

5168
02:51:50,410 --> 02:51:52,110
Yeah we're top 10.

5169
02:51:52,190 --> 02:51:52,270
No.

5170
02:51:52,370 --> 02:51:53,090
We're 10th place.

5171
02:51:54,050 --> 02:51:54,530
Actually?

5172
02:51:54,790 --> 02:51:55,830
Yeah we're actually top 10.

5173
02:51:55,830 --> 02:51:56,590
Oh god.

5174
02:51:56,650 --> 02:51:59,130
Yeah we're top 10.

5175
02:51:59,350 --> 02:51:59,570
Bro!

5176
02:52:00,590 --> 02:52:01,230
Hello?

5177
02:52:01,650 --> 02:52:02,690
Our goal...

5178
02:52:02,690 --> 02:52:03,870
Not last.

5179
02:52:04,130 --> 02:52:06,010
Not last.

5180
02:52:06,490 --> 02:52:07,450
Bro wait.

5181
02:52:07,690 --> 02:52:09,470
This last game is...

5182
02:52:09,470 --> 02:52:12,230
The last game makes or breaks it though.

5183
02:52:12,370 --> 02:52:13,870
Yeah we gotta get some KP.

5184
02:52:16,410 --> 02:52:18,390
I feel like everyone just plays normally.

5185
02:52:18,390 --> 02:52:20,930
Our landmark is really bad for KP.

5186
02:52:21,510 --> 02:52:23,430
Yeah we just get shit.

5187
02:52:23,750 --> 02:52:24,950
I think we just play normally.

5188
02:52:25,010 --> 02:52:25,150
No?

5189
02:52:25,830 --> 02:52:28,030
Yeah we just play... I think we just play how we normally play.

5190
02:52:29,130 --> 02:52:32,550
Our fucking beaconsy has been... been working well.

5191
02:52:39,680 --> 02:52:40,940
Let me in!

5192
02:52:41,120 --> 02:52:41,880
I wanna play!

5193
02:52:43,340 --> 02:52:44,560
Oh there we go.

5194
02:52:44,880 --> 02:52:45,940
Let us in!

5195
02:52:49,140 --> 02:52:50,980
We just won a game.

5196
02:52:58,670 --> 02:53:00,210
Let us in!

5197
02:53:05,230 --> 02:53:05,830
Oh!

5198
02:53:10,080 --> 02:53:10,840
We're starting.

5199
02:53:11,060 --> 02:53:11,520
Yes!

5200
02:53:12,620 --> 02:53:13,540
Same team comp.

5201
02:53:17,490 --> 02:53:18,910
Wait where are we landing again?

5202
02:53:19,530 --> 02:53:20,010
Um...

5203
02:53:20,010 --> 02:53:20,510
Oh yeah middle.

5204
02:53:20,870 --> 02:53:23,690
The place.

5205
02:53:24,110 --> 02:53:24,610
That place.

5206
02:53:25,070 --> 02:53:26,090
Oh I get Mirage.

5207
02:53:26,170 --> 02:53:27,250
I get Mirage.

5208
02:53:27,250 --> 02:53:28,630
You guys go land that area.

5209
02:53:32,110 --> 02:53:34,950
Yeah ping me a Carbine and a Volt.

5210
02:53:36,370 --> 02:53:37,050
Carbine, Volt.

5211
02:53:37,170 --> 02:53:37,390
Yeah.

5212
02:53:37,650 --> 02:53:39,390
Carbine, Volt has been working well for me.

5213
02:53:43,030 --> 02:53:44,210
Or a Repeater.

5214
02:53:44,210 --> 02:53:45,090
Carbine, Volt.

5215
02:53:45,290 --> 02:53:46,490
Carbine, Repeater, Volt.

5216
02:54:01,520 --> 02:54:02,360
Let's go!

5217
02:54:09,200 --> 02:54:09,760
Let's go!

5218
02:54:09,760 --> 02:54:09,840
Alright.

5219
02:54:09,960 --> 02:54:10,420
Here we go.

5220
02:54:13,080 --> 02:54:13,640
Alright.

5221
02:54:13,640 --> 02:54:13,640
Here we go.

5222
02:54:13,640 --> 02:54:14,020
Yeah shit.

5223
02:54:16,120 --> 02:54:16,680
Sick.

5224
02:54:17,940 --> 02:54:18,500
Alright.

5225
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:24,400
Oh I'm gonna land Mirage now since the beacon is...

5226
02:54:24,400 --> 02:54:24,440
Oh I'm gonna land Mirage now since the beacon is...

5227
02:54:24,440 --> 02:54:25,940
Oh there's no beacon right?

5228
02:54:27,040 --> 02:54:27,600
Yeah.

5229
02:54:27,740 --> 02:54:28,340
Yeah okay.

5230
02:54:28,340 --> 02:54:29,020
I shall go.

5231
02:54:31,160 --> 02:54:31,640
Alright.

5232
02:54:31,640 --> 02:54:32,820
I'll land with Tayo then.

5233
02:54:34,240 --> 02:54:34,860
Let's go.

5234
02:54:35,980 --> 02:54:36,600
Let's go.

5235
02:54:36,680 --> 02:54:37,380
I know this map.

5236
02:54:40,200 --> 02:54:42,040
I trust in our IGLs.

5237
02:54:44,120 --> 02:54:44,920
I got you guys.

5238
02:54:44,920 --> 02:54:45,580
I land the top.

5239
02:54:45,580 --> 02:54:46,940
You can get the bottom, Tayo.

5240
02:54:48,360 --> 02:54:49,460
I'll grab the top.

5241
02:54:50,820 --> 02:54:51,480
You start!

5242
02:54:53,160 --> 02:54:56,360
Bro I felt like we knocked like a billion people last game bro.

5243
02:54:56,640 --> 02:54:57,120
Yeah.

5244
02:54:57,120 --> 02:54:58,700
Everyone just got rezzed.

5245
02:54:59,280 --> 02:55:00,260
Bro I'm alive.

5246
02:55:00,940 --> 02:55:02,580
I was like oh my god we're farming.

5247
02:55:02,760 --> 02:55:04,260
Yeah I was like oh my god we got so many kills.

5248
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:06,420
Nope.

5249
02:55:06,720 --> 02:55:07,620
It was like two.

5250
02:55:07,780 --> 02:55:08,100
Two.

5251
02:55:08,100 --> 02:55:08,400
Okay.

5252
02:55:09,960 --> 02:55:10,380
Okay.

5253
02:55:10,380 --> 02:55:10,800
Two.

5254
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:13,560
Let's see.

5255
02:55:13,700 --> 02:55:14,920
I think I'll go Repeater.

5256
02:55:25,250 --> 02:55:27,050
Actually I'll run Carbine.

5257
02:55:27,270 --> 02:55:28,690
I have a Bolt for you.

5258
02:55:29,090 --> 02:55:29,510
Alright.

5259
02:55:30,370 --> 02:55:32,010
I found Bolt just now too.

5260
02:55:33,190 --> 02:55:34,510
You can have it if you want that.

5261
02:55:35,370 --> 02:55:36,010
I'm good.

5262
02:55:36,290 --> 02:55:37,670
Wait we might have zone guys.

5263
02:55:38,270 --> 02:55:38,570
Oh.

5264
02:55:38,650 --> 02:55:39,690
Okay that's not good.

5265
02:55:40,530 --> 02:55:43,870
We have to just loot fast and just set up I guess.

5266
02:55:44,050 --> 02:55:44,170
Wait yeah.

5267
02:55:44,370 --> 02:55:45,890
That is actually not good.

5268
02:55:45,990 --> 02:55:47,170
We're gonna get fucking...

5269
02:55:47,170 --> 02:55:49,330
I have the key thing too.

5270
02:55:50,510 --> 02:55:51,310
If we need.

5271
02:55:51,430 --> 02:55:52,150
And blue backpack.

5272
02:55:53,330 --> 02:55:55,370
Let me know when to scan.

5273
02:55:58,940 --> 02:55:59,380
Shit.

5274
02:55:59,580 --> 02:56:00,780
Cause I feel like...

5275
02:56:01,740 --> 02:56:01,980
I don't know.

5276
02:56:02,020 --> 02:56:03,060
I don't know if I should scan early.

5277
02:56:04,520 --> 02:56:07,320
But like I'm worried that I'm gonna get fucking run up on.

5278
02:56:07,480 --> 02:56:09,100
When we are about to leave probably.

5279
02:56:09,700 --> 02:56:10,180
Scan.

5280
02:56:12,660 --> 02:56:13,140
Ooh.

5281
02:56:13,300 --> 02:56:14,000
First kill.

5282
02:56:14,380 --> 02:56:14,860
Revenant.

5283
02:56:14,940 --> 02:56:15,840
This is running in.

5284
02:56:15,900 --> 02:56:16,640
I got the ulti stuff.

5285
02:56:16,740 --> 02:56:17,140
Rev.

5286
02:56:17,140 --> 02:56:17,820
Oh god.

5287
02:56:18,080 --> 02:56:18,800
It started.

5288
02:56:19,560 --> 02:56:21,620
Oh people are going for kills.

5289
02:56:22,680 --> 02:56:23,920
Wait can I loot this?

5290
02:56:26,220 --> 02:56:26,700
Yeah.

5291
02:56:26,740 --> 02:56:27,120
Very cool.

5292
02:56:27,480 --> 02:56:28,960
I'm gonna grab that blue backpack then.

5293
02:56:30,580 --> 02:56:31,620
Alright I'm gonna grab the...

5294
02:56:31,740 --> 02:56:32,980
Our little...

5295
02:56:34,220 --> 02:56:36,640
The lava fissure team is ballooning right now.

5296
02:56:36,760 --> 02:56:37,280
They have a B.

5297
02:56:37,340 --> 02:56:39,420
Are they ballooning to us?

5298
02:56:39,700 --> 02:56:40,900
Let's see where they are going.

5299
02:56:41,480 --> 02:56:43,620
I don't see where they are going yet.

5300
02:56:44,220 --> 02:56:45,700
They are heading towards...

5301
02:56:45,700 --> 02:56:46,840
Probably thermal choke.

5302
02:56:47,200 --> 02:56:48,460
Yeah they are heading towards...

5303
02:56:48,460 --> 02:56:50,980
If they are heading towards thermal go up this choke.

5304
02:56:51,140 --> 02:56:52,300
Or that height right here.

5305
02:56:53,620 --> 02:56:55,300
You want me to scan or no?

5306
02:56:56,760 --> 02:56:58,060
Wait there is no balloon.

5307
02:56:58,200 --> 02:56:58,580
There is no balloon.

5308
02:56:58,580 --> 02:56:59,540
Yeah yeah yeah scan the beacon.

5309
02:56:59,660 --> 02:57:00,480
Wait wait there is a shield.

5310
02:57:00,700 --> 02:57:02,560
I think there is a shield here.

5311
02:57:02,620 --> 02:57:03,360
They are on me.

5312
02:57:05,020 --> 02:57:05,840
Wait I'm coming.

5313
02:57:06,040 --> 02:57:06,460
They are over here.

5314
02:57:07,980 --> 02:57:09,720
They haven't crossed yet.

5315
02:57:10,120 --> 02:57:12,600
I think they are just rotating.

5316
02:57:13,040 --> 02:57:13,240
Okay.

5317
02:57:15,220 --> 02:57:16,120
I'll get a splurge.

5318
02:57:16,340 --> 02:57:16,920
I'm coming to you guys.

5319
02:57:17,540 --> 02:57:19,320
They are just going towards thermal.

5320
02:57:19,660 --> 02:57:20,980
We can go for the beacon scan.

5321
02:57:21,060 --> 02:57:21,460
I'll watch.

5322
02:57:22,980 --> 02:57:23,780
They left.

5323
02:57:24,900 --> 02:57:25,700
Attack 140.

5324
02:57:27,340 --> 02:57:28,160
That was scary.

5325
02:57:28,440 --> 02:57:28,980
Holy shit.

5326
02:57:29,040 --> 02:57:29,460
Where are we going?

5327
02:57:30,720 --> 02:57:31,900
I'm going to scan first.

5328
02:57:32,640 --> 02:57:33,680
Top of the hill.

5329
02:57:36,520 --> 02:57:37,100
Let's see.

5330
02:57:38,680 --> 02:57:39,920
Wait scan this...

5331
02:57:39,920 --> 02:57:41,620
What is this drop?

5332
02:57:41,900 --> 02:57:42,720
What is this drop?

5333
02:57:43,100 --> 02:57:45,180
Yeah everyone is going to thermal.

5334
02:57:45,620 --> 02:57:47,540
Wait I think we should... let's go for this drop.

5335
02:57:47,680 --> 02:57:48,420
Let's go for this drop.

5336
02:57:48,740 --> 02:57:50,080
I have the key on me.

5337
02:57:50,120 --> 02:57:53,360
I need a scope.

5338
02:57:54,120 --> 02:57:55,180
If you guys found one.

5339
02:57:55,700 --> 02:57:56,620
Go play for this drop.

5340
02:57:56,700 --> 02:57:58,660
I'm going to get our weapon supply.

5341
02:57:58,960 --> 02:57:59,160
Okay.

5342
02:58:01,340 --> 02:58:03,380
I'm waiting for the drop right now.

5343
02:58:07,090 --> 02:58:08,510
I'm not risking that Ashe.

5344
02:58:09,170 --> 02:58:10,370
I feel like somebody...

5345
02:58:10,370 --> 02:58:12,490
I feel like they are going to grab it first before us.

5346
02:58:14,430 --> 02:58:15,190
We are good.

5347
02:58:16,250 --> 02:58:17,130
We are chilling.

5348
02:58:19,010 --> 02:58:19,990
There is thermal.

5349
02:58:19,990 --> 02:58:20,790
They are resing.

5350
02:58:20,790 --> 02:58:21,890
They are resing at...

5351
02:58:21,890 --> 02:58:23,330
Whatever it's called.

5352
02:58:24,530 --> 02:58:25,190
Volcano shit.

5353
02:58:25,670 --> 02:58:26,810
Whatever that English...

5354
02:58:27,910 --> 02:58:28,570
Lava Fisher.

5355
02:58:30,890 --> 02:58:31,650
Volcano shit.

5356
02:58:34,770 --> 02:58:35,610
What is it?

5357
02:58:35,950 --> 02:58:37,650
Oh gold.

5358
02:58:38,470 --> 02:58:39,230
Not bad.

5359
02:58:40,810 --> 02:58:41,690
Are we just going to get it?

5360
02:58:41,830 --> 02:58:42,250
It's not bad.

5361
02:58:42,450 --> 02:58:42,990
Do you want to use it?

5362
02:58:43,690 --> 02:58:44,290
I can't.

5363
02:58:44,310 --> 02:58:44,810
I'll drop my bolt.

5364
02:58:46,870 --> 02:58:48,270
Anyone wants to have a purple?

5365
02:58:48,850 --> 02:58:50,210
Nah I'm just going to shotgun.

5366
02:58:50,770 --> 02:58:52,090
Alright I'm going to run double light.

5367
02:58:52,170 --> 02:58:53,010
Let's go.

5368
02:58:54,430 --> 02:58:56,170
We hold here and we always...

5369
02:58:56,170 --> 02:58:57,610
We just hold our mirage side.

5370
02:58:57,830 --> 02:58:58,230
Alright.

5371
02:58:59,370 --> 02:59:00,570
Oh finally a scope.

5372
02:59:02,730 --> 02:59:04,010
Okay this is going to be the most...

5373
02:59:04,010 --> 02:59:04,650
I'm going to drop the key.

5374
02:59:04,830 --> 02:59:06,110
Because I don't think we are going to grab it anyway.

5375
02:59:07,690 --> 02:59:09,070
We need to...

5376
02:59:09,070 --> 02:59:11,470
We only need to fight once here.

5377
02:59:11,590 --> 02:59:12,370
Once or twice.

5378
02:59:12,730 --> 02:59:14,290
Once we win those one...

5379
02:59:14,290 --> 02:59:17,070
Those once or two fights...

5380
02:59:17,070 --> 02:59:18,330
We have a...

5381
02:59:18,330 --> 02:59:21,190
Okay I'll look in front of us then while you guys...

5382
02:59:22,490 --> 02:59:23,290
I just...

5383
02:59:23,330 --> 02:59:23,850
I'm just looking behind.

5384
02:59:24,270 --> 02:59:25,550
I'll look in the front then.

5385
02:59:25,730 --> 02:59:27,350
There's a Watson team in the house.

5386
02:59:30,490 --> 02:59:31,510
There's a medkit here.

5387
02:59:31,810 --> 02:59:32,390
There's a medkit here.

5388
02:59:36,230 --> 02:59:38,210
That's probably Cheeki and them again bro.

5389
02:59:38,890 --> 02:59:39,410
No.

5390
02:59:39,410 --> 02:59:40,150
They're farming everybody.

5391
02:59:41,490 --> 02:59:42,770
They're just running it down.

5392
02:59:43,130 --> 02:59:44,990
Yeah too bad it's the 20th team.

5393
02:59:46,610 --> 02:59:47,610
There's a team...

5394
02:59:47,610 --> 02:59:49,030
There's a Loba team in this house.

5395
02:59:49,530 --> 02:59:50,430
And so...

5396
02:59:50,430 --> 02:59:52,470
There's a Loba lifeline team.

5397
02:59:52,970 --> 02:59:55,410
They just don't care about the KP.

5398
02:59:55,830 --> 02:59:56,490
Yeah they...

5399
02:59:57,210 --> 02:59:58,810
Oh they're placement man.

5400
02:59:58,810 --> 02:59:59,830
Oh they're like lifeline drop.

5401
03:00:03,570 --> 03:00:04,010
Alright.

5402
03:00:05,070 --> 03:00:06,510
You gotta let me know who's cracked.

5403
03:00:06,690 --> 03:00:07,870
Because I have my pew pew pew.

5404
03:00:08,030 --> 03:00:08,690
My hammer point.

5405
03:00:10,790 --> 03:00:11,950
I'm just smoking out.

5406
03:00:12,170 --> 03:00:13,250
Try to make my presence known.

5407
03:00:14,090 --> 03:00:14,530
Please.

5408
03:00:14,910 --> 03:00:15,350
Okay.

5409
03:00:17,890 --> 03:00:19,750
I don't know the fucking drop off.

5410
03:00:19,870 --> 03:00:20,470
But it's fine.

5411
03:00:21,910 --> 03:00:23,330
That was a single fire.

5412
03:00:23,490 --> 03:00:24,170
God damn it.

5413
03:00:24,670 --> 03:00:26,790
Is that Rampart too?

5414
03:00:26,930 --> 03:00:28,130
I single fired that shit.

5415
03:00:28,890 --> 03:00:30,050
Yeah it's Rampart.

5416
03:00:30,130 --> 03:00:31,930
Wait no it's Rampart Caustic Loba.

5417
03:00:32,210 --> 03:00:32,510
Yeah.

5418
03:00:32,570 --> 03:00:35,330
I was like wait a minute.

5419
03:00:35,430 --> 03:00:36,290
That's a Rampart.

5420
03:00:38,270 --> 03:00:39,470
I don't wanna waste my life.

5421
03:00:40,110 --> 03:00:41,130
You guys on board.

5422
03:00:42,610 --> 03:00:43,810
No don't do anything.

5423
03:00:44,030 --> 03:00:45,270
Taya we gotta keep top 10.

5424
03:00:45,730 --> 03:00:46,250
No.

5425
03:00:47,690 --> 03:00:49,810
Turn off your DPS brain.

5426
03:00:50,470 --> 03:00:53,390
We got an honorable ending here.

5427
03:00:54,790 --> 03:00:56,490
Turn off your DPS brain.

5428
03:00:56,830 --> 03:00:57,530
Okay you're serious.

5429
03:00:57,650 --> 03:00:58,870
There should be a party there by the way.

5430
03:00:59,030 --> 03:01:00,970
They're rezzing at lava fission.

5431
03:01:02,050 --> 03:01:02,590
Yeah.

5432
03:01:03,890 --> 03:01:04,430
Yeah.

5433
03:01:06,030 --> 03:01:08,750
And before it's like fucking harvest area.

5434
03:01:08,970 --> 03:01:10,390
Oh yes we got zone.

5435
03:01:10,570 --> 03:01:10,890
Nice.

5436
03:01:11,770 --> 03:01:12,310
Yes.

5437
03:01:13,210 --> 03:01:15,890
I shouldn't push up past this.

5438
03:01:15,930 --> 03:01:16,370
Yeah nah.

5439
03:01:17,370 --> 03:01:18,410
Oh people.

5440
03:01:18,610 --> 03:01:19,870
Oh my god.

5441
03:01:20,470 --> 03:01:21,350
I'm gonna scan for you.

5442
03:01:22,570 --> 03:01:23,950
They're like really far off.

5443
03:01:24,110 --> 03:01:25,290
Yeah look behind here.

5444
03:01:25,470 --> 03:01:26,330
They're far.

5445
03:01:28,910 --> 03:01:32,290
They're probably gonna just chill there until like next zone.

5446
03:01:32,290 --> 03:01:33,210
They might ape.

5447
03:01:33,330 --> 03:01:33,730
Watch out.

5448
03:01:33,830 --> 03:01:34,110
I'm looking.

5449
03:01:34,590 --> 03:01:35,710
I'm looking across for you.

5450
03:01:35,790 --> 03:01:35,850
I'm watching.

5451
03:01:36,250 --> 03:01:38,470
I don't think anybody's gonna.

5452
03:01:38,670 --> 03:01:40,090
They're gonna wait there until next zone.

5453
03:01:41,730 --> 03:01:42,390
For sure.

5454
03:01:42,910 --> 03:01:43,670
You guys need this?

5455
03:01:46,590 --> 03:01:47,550
Someone's being a little.

5456
03:01:48,670 --> 03:01:49,850
Oh that's a valve.

5457
03:01:51,950 --> 03:01:52,670
Let's see.

5458
03:01:52,850 --> 03:01:53,850
They fucked up?

5459
03:01:53,970 --> 03:01:54,110
No.

5460
03:01:55,610 --> 03:01:56,570
Blue purples.

5461
03:01:57,770 --> 03:01:58,570
They're over there.

5462
03:01:58,810 --> 03:02:00,610
I'm gonna get angles here.

5463
03:02:01,090 --> 03:02:02,630
I'm gonna look behind still.

5464
03:02:02,750 --> 03:02:03,670
We need to look behind still.

5465
03:02:05,030 --> 03:02:06,070
They're on top of the roof.

5466
03:02:06,190 --> 03:02:07,310
Let me push here then.

5467
03:02:09,290 --> 03:02:10,230
I'm looking behind us.

5468
03:02:10,230 --> 03:02:11,390
They're below you.

5469
03:02:12,490 --> 03:02:14,230
They're like on this rock.

5470
03:02:15,130 --> 03:02:16,690
They're not getting shot from behind.

5471
03:02:17,270 --> 03:02:17,950
No last.

5472
03:02:18,470 --> 03:02:19,230
Woah woah woah.

5473
03:02:20,070 --> 03:02:20,930
I got sniped by.

5474
03:02:20,930 --> 03:02:21,170
People behind?

5475
03:02:21,410 --> 03:02:21,990
No no no.

5476
03:02:22,090 --> 03:02:22,390
Here here.

5477
03:02:22,510 --> 03:02:24,330
I got sniped from behind us.

5478
03:02:24,690 --> 03:02:27,250
I only have two shield cells left.

5479
03:02:27,330 --> 03:02:27,810
They're like right there.

5480
03:02:27,950 --> 03:02:29,190
I have a bunch of shield cells.

5481
03:02:29,210 --> 03:02:29,570
I'll give you.

5482
03:02:29,810 --> 03:02:31,390
I have three bats though.

5483
03:02:31,430 --> 03:02:31,790
Do you need bats?

5484
03:02:31,970 --> 03:02:33,690
Yeah I need one bat please.

5485
03:02:34,330 --> 03:02:35,390
One bat to bat.

5486
03:02:38,370 --> 03:02:39,170
Shoot them.

5487
03:02:39,250 --> 03:02:39,490
Yes.

5488
03:02:40,090 --> 03:02:41,230
Why are you shooting us?

5489
03:02:42,690 --> 03:02:43,490
Am I?

5490
03:02:43,570 --> 03:02:44,010
Oh my god.

5491
03:02:44,850 --> 03:02:45,530
I'll look.

5492
03:02:45,550 --> 03:02:46,710
I'll still look behind us.

5493
03:02:46,830 --> 03:02:47,910
I'll stay here then.

5494
03:02:47,990 --> 03:02:48,930
So I won't get shot.

5495
03:02:49,290 --> 03:02:50,390
The team that's.

5496
03:02:50,470 --> 03:02:51,590
That fucking.

5497
03:02:52,010 --> 03:02:53,550
Team is not shooting them.

5498
03:02:53,950 --> 03:02:55,150
Yeah they're in the house.

5499
03:02:55,230 --> 03:02:56,010
Why aren't they shooting them?

5500
03:02:56,390 --> 03:02:56,870
They're scared.

5501
03:02:57,110 --> 03:02:57,110
Yeah.

5502
03:02:58,530 --> 03:02:59,310
They're scared.

5503
03:02:59,310 --> 03:03:00,070
They need the placements.

5504
03:03:00,070 --> 03:03:00,950
I'm about to shoot at the house.

5505
03:03:01,910 --> 03:03:02,930
Get their attention.

5506
03:03:03,410 --> 03:03:06,050
Yeah look at.

5507
03:03:06,150 --> 03:03:07,090
Look over here.

5508
03:03:07,710 --> 03:03:08,350
The fuck?

5509
03:03:13,340 --> 03:03:15,280
I swear if you shoot them.

5510
03:03:15,280 --> 03:03:16,040
And they look at me.

5511
03:03:16,120 --> 03:03:16,760
I swear to god.

5512
03:03:19,400 --> 03:03:19,880
I'm gonna shoot them.

5513
03:03:19,880 --> 03:03:21,140
That should do it right?

5514
03:03:21,380 --> 03:03:23,460
Oh you're using some brain stress here.

5515
03:03:25,040 --> 03:03:26,280
I don't see anybody yet.

5516
03:03:26,740 --> 03:03:28,260
I don't have any fucking ammo.

5517
03:03:29,940 --> 03:03:31,420
Yeah looks like it.

5518
03:03:32,120 --> 03:03:32,800
Right there.

5519
03:03:32,960 --> 03:03:33,620
Oh team team team team.

5520
03:03:33,820 --> 03:03:34,840
They landed to our left.

5521
03:03:34,920 --> 03:03:35,220
Okay okay.

5522
03:03:36,240 --> 03:03:38,140
I see that.

5523
03:03:38,260 --> 03:03:39,340
They're on the height right now.

5524
03:03:39,400 --> 03:03:40,260
Here on the rock.

5525
03:03:41,840 --> 03:03:42,560
They smoked?

5526
03:03:42,960 --> 03:03:44,120
They're smoking us.

5527
03:03:45,520 --> 03:03:47,260
I didn't get anybody my scan.

5528
03:03:47,780 --> 03:03:48,340
I'm watching.

5529
03:03:48,340 --> 03:03:49,060
Not pushing it.

5530
03:03:53,340 --> 03:03:54,360
If we fight this.

5531
03:03:54,460 --> 03:03:57,740
We can't get knocked since we're just gonna get pushed by this team as well.

5532
03:03:57,940 --> 03:03:58,180
Yeah.

5533
03:03:58,180 --> 03:04:01,560
We kinda have to fight from like a little more up front.

5534
03:04:01,760 --> 03:04:02,700
So we don't get.

5535
03:04:03,000 --> 03:04:04,500
Looks like they're rotating.

5536
03:04:04,720 --> 03:04:05,840
They're getting shot from other people.

5537
03:04:06,400 --> 03:04:07,600
I can scan the three.

5538
03:04:09,800 --> 03:04:11,440
Oh they're on top of the thing.

5539
03:04:11,580 --> 03:04:11,880
They dropped.

5540
03:04:13,300 --> 03:04:14,420
There's two teams there.

5541
03:04:14,500 --> 03:04:15,240
That should be good.

5542
03:04:15,420 --> 03:04:16,280
They start fighting.

5543
03:04:16,640 --> 03:04:17,640
Someone needs to watch that.

5544
03:04:17,920 --> 03:04:20,280
They're playing the bus right now.

5545
03:04:20,780 --> 03:04:22,080
I'm still watching for us.

5546
03:04:23,540 --> 03:04:24,660
I see him.

5547
03:04:25,320 --> 03:04:25,740
He's like.

5548
03:04:25,780 --> 03:04:26,640
They ran to our left.

5549
03:04:26,860 --> 03:04:27,760
He's behind that rock.

5550
03:04:28,780 --> 03:04:29,720
I'm watching them.

5551
03:04:31,160 --> 03:04:32,580
They slid down again.

5552
03:04:32,780 --> 03:04:34,120
It's a Pathfinder Bang team.

5553
03:04:38,460 --> 03:04:39,360
They're still there.

5554
03:04:41,300 --> 03:04:41,780
Oh.

5555
03:04:42,580 --> 03:04:43,740
Okay I'm batting.

5556
03:04:44,100 --> 03:04:45,460
I expected this.

5557
03:04:45,540 --> 03:04:46,180
35 purple.

5558
03:04:46,920 --> 03:04:47,700
Cracked a bang.

5559
03:04:49,460 --> 03:04:50,660
I'm going to go to the people under here.

5560
03:04:54,020 --> 03:04:56,320
Only one bat so I'm not going to poke too much.

5561
03:04:56,900 --> 03:04:57,860
How many cells do you have?

5562
03:04:57,960 --> 03:04:59,120
I have a lot of cells.

5563
03:04:59,160 --> 03:05:00,880
This team shouldn't go for us.

5564
03:05:01,040 --> 03:05:03,920
They should just stay on their side.

5565
03:05:04,040 --> 03:05:04,420
This team.

5566
03:05:04,700 --> 03:05:06,160
We're going to play for a Valkyld here.

5567
03:05:06,420 --> 03:05:10,620
A good Valkyld is probably going to be landing underneath here.

5568
03:05:10,880 --> 03:05:11,700
That platform.

5569
03:05:12,340 --> 03:05:12,740
Okay.

5570
03:05:13,300 --> 03:05:14,320
Where should we Valkyld?

5571
03:05:14,360 --> 03:05:15,420
We can just look.

5572
03:05:15,740 --> 03:05:17,860
We can just Valkyld from over here.

5573
03:05:17,920 --> 03:05:18,620
Looks like they're pushing us.

5574
03:05:19,060 --> 03:05:19,080
Oh.

5575
03:05:19,880 --> 03:05:20,360
Scatting?

5576
03:05:20,460 --> 03:05:21,020
I'm watching.

5577
03:05:21,240 --> 03:05:22,220
Don't give them entry.

5578
03:05:22,400 --> 03:05:24,680
I'm just going to ult for now.

5579
03:05:26,420 --> 03:05:27,360
I can give you ult.

5580
03:05:27,380 --> 03:05:28,260
I have ult.

5581
03:05:28,340 --> 03:05:29,600
I don't think they're going to push.

5582
03:05:30,220 --> 03:05:34,100
I think they're also just making sure we don't push them.

5583
03:05:34,440 --> 03:05:34,900
Maybe.

5584
03:05:35,040 --> 03:05:37,960
Or maybe the Bloodhound ult scared them.

5585
03:05:41,350 --> 03:05:42,690
They came up to the...

5586
03:05:43,430 --> 03:05:44,370
They ran back.

5587
03:05:47,670 --> 03:05:48,750
Where the fuck?

5588
03:05:49,430 --> 03:05:50,330
Wait for Valkyld.

5589
03:05:50,810 --> 03:05:51,870
We're going to Valkyld from here.

5590
03:05:53,430 --> 03:05:53,990
Over here?

5591
03:05:54,190 --> 03:05:55,210
I think that's the Bloodhound.

5592
03:05:55,870 --> 03:05:57,650
The Bloodhound ult definitely scared them.

5593
03:05:57,670 --> 03:05:58,690
Yeah, I got one.

5594
03:05:58,750 --> 03:05:58,950
It's fine.

5595
03:06:00,010 --> 03:06:01,910
I have one as well.

5596
03:06:02,490 --> 03:06:05,050
I'll just do it again so we can have it for...

5597
03:06:05,050 --> 03:06:06,310
Yeah, the next fight.

5598
03:06:07,450 --> 03:06:08,210
17 seconds.

5599
03:06:08,530 --> 03:06:09,350
Come to my side.

5600
03:06:09,550 --> 03:06:10,350
Yes sir.

5601
03:06:12,850 --> 03:06:14,570
We're just going to Valkyld from here as well.

5602
03:06:14,850 --> 03:06:15,070
Here?

5603
03:06:16,930 --> 03:06:17,690
Right here is fine?

5604
03:06:18,350 --> 03:06:19,010
Is it...

5605
03:06:19,010 --> 03:06:20,270
Do we have cover here?

5606
03:06:20,610 --> 03:06:21,990
Yeah, I'm just worried about...

5607
03:06:21,990 --> 03:06:22,230
Here?

5608
03:06:23,430 --> 03:06:23,930
Can we do it?

5609
03:06:24,530 --> 03:06:25,790
Team shouldn't push us.

5610
03:06:26,150 --> 03:06:28,430
3, 2, 1.

5611
03:06:28,890 --> 03:06:30,070
Rip it.

5612
03:06:30,570 --> 03:06:32,970
I'm just going to spam sping where we're landing.

5613
03:06:34,570 --> 03:06:36,370
Just move towards like over here.

5614
03:06:39,550 --> 03:06:40,450
No one's underneath.

5615
03:06:40,590 --> 03:06:40,810
Let's go.

5616
03:06:40,890 --> 03:06:41,310
Take underneath.

5617
03:06:41,490 --> 03:06:41,850
Take underneath.

5618
03:06:41,990 --> 03:06:42,730
Underneath the platform.

5619
03:06:45,950 --> 03:06:46,430
Okay.

5620
03:06:46,430 --> 03:06:46,590
I'm on it.

5621
03:06:47,210 --> 03:06:48,870
Just chill right here.

5622
03:06:51,050 --> 03:06:52,530
Alright, we're just chilling right here.

5623
03:06:52,650 --> 03:06:52,870
Alright.

5624
03:06:52,990 --> 03:06:54,410
Watch our landings as well.

5625
03:06:55,070 --> 03:06:55,810
Do I scan?

5626
03:06:56,090 --> 03:06:57,010
And make presence now?

5627
03:06:57,030 --> 03:06:58,970
Just show presence.

5628
03:07:00,150 --> 03:07:00,830
I got one.

5629
03:07:00,950 --> 03:07:01,050
I got one.

5630
03:07:01,110 --> 03:07:04,110
Yeah, on top of the building.

5631
03:07:04,930 --> 03:07:05,790
There's a caustic.

5632
03:07:06,250 --> 03:07:07,410
How many how many do you have?

5633
03:07:07,470 --> 03:07:09,370
How many teams is that?

5634
03:07:10,650 --> 03:07:11,090
116.

5635
03:07:11,410 --> 03:07:13,470
There's so many teams by the way.

5636
03:07:13,610 --> 03:07:14,250
Oh ho.

5637
03:07:16,910 --> 03:07:17,810
Okay, I got one kill.

5638
03:07:17,910 --> 03:07:18,670
I'm going to look forward.

5639
03:07:19,030 --> 03:07:20,110
Keep watching our back.

5640
03:07:20,290 --> 03:07:21,290
Yeah, I'm watching up here.

5641
03:07:21,370 --> 03:07:21,830
I'm watching up here.

5642
03:07:23,090 --> 03:07:24,630
I'm going to get shot though from here.

5643
03:07:24,710 --> 03:07:26,130
No, actually I should be fine.

5644
03:07:28,950 --> 03:07:29,910
There's a team right here.

5645
03:07:30,250 --> 03:07:30,610
Scanning?

5646
03:07:32,990 --> 03:07:34,410
That's the team that I killed.

5647
03:07:34,470 --> 03:07:35,690
I think the people in the house.

5648
03:07:36,510 --> 03:07:36,870
Ummm.

5649
03:07:38,130 --> 03:07:39,110
I popped my ult.

5650
03:07:39,190 --> 03:07:40,030
Popped this ult itself.

5651
03:07:40,410 --> 03:07:40,770
Hiya.

5652
03:07:41,830 --> 03:07:42,550
Right here.

5653
03:07:42,550 --> 03:07:42,730
Right here.

5654
03:07:43,090 --> 03:07:43,850
I'm 40 right now.

5655
03:07:43,850 --> 03:07:44,630
I got my gold helmet too.

5656
03:07:48,280 --> 03:07:49,760
Might need to vapple for this.

5657
03:07:49,780 --> 03:07:50,840
Like a squad here.

5658
03:07:50,980 --> 03:07:52,220
Since there's a team in front of us.

5659
03:07:52,240 --> 03:07:52,840
Blue armor in the house.

5660
03:07:53,160 --> 03:07:55,440
Can't really fight this drop really.

5661
03:07:55,820 --> 03:07:56,120
83.

5662
03:07:57,400 --> 03:07:58,660
Just going to get shot in the back.

5663
03:07:58,680 --> 03:08:00,260
Oh wait, they rez'd.

5664
03:08:00,300 --> 03:08:00,540
Okay.

5665
03:08:04,700 --> 03:08:05,100
90.

5666
03:08:06,100 --> 03:08:08,020
We're going to play for this like...

5667
03:08:08,020 --> 03:08:09,020
Just walk it in.

5668
03:08:09,160 --> 03:08:09,760
Walk it in.

5669
03:08:09,900 --> 03:08:12,980
Make sure this team behind us, like, don't push us.

5670
03:08:13,460 --> 03:08:14,440
I'm looking at them.

5671
03:08:14,500 --> 03:08:15,960
They've been in the house so far.

5672
03:08:16,240 --> 03:08:17,300
They've just been in this house.

5673
03:08:18,020 --> 03:08:19,600
There's people on the first floor.

5674
03:08:20,360 --> 03:08:20,980
Right here.

5675
03:08:21,160 --> 03:08:21,520
I vault.

5676
03:08:21,680 --> 03:08:21,780
I vault.

5677
03:08:22,020 --> 03:08:23,080
I'll get back your helmet.

5678
03:08:26,440 --> 03:08:27,380
There's like a team.

5679
03:08:27,460 --> 03:08:28,060
There's a team.

5680
03:08:28,180 --> 03:08:30,200
Not Ferdinand and Choke from there.

5681
03:08:30,320 --> 03:08:31,280
The Choke team.

5682
03:08:32,380 --> 03:08:32,820
Yeah.

5683
03:08:33,280 --> 03:08:34,280
Tell me when to fight.

5684
03:08:34,680 --> 03:08:35,640
Fighting on the height.

5685
03:08:35,840 --> 03:08:37,560
They're just fighting here on the height.

5686
03:08:37,760 --> 03:08:38,660
Watching this team.

5687
03:08:38,660 --> 03:08:39,980
This team might drop into us maybe.

5688
03:08:40,360 --> 03:08:41,520
Holy what the fuck.

5689
03:08:42,640 --> 03:08:43,080
Woah!

5690
03:08:43,240 --> 03:08:43,820

5691
03:08:46,420 --> 03:08:46,880
Oh no.

5692
03:08:46,880 --> 03:08:47,600

Yeah this team is watching us now.

5694
03:08:52,320 --> 03:08:52,900
This team is looking.

5695
03:08:52,900 --> 03:08:53,540
This team might drop down.

5696
03:08:54,740 --> 03:08:55,620
We're back out now?

5697
03:08:55,860 --> 03:08:56,420
Back out right now.

5698
03:08:56,460 --> 03:08:56,880
Back out right now.

5699
03:08:57,880 --> 03:08:59,780
We're going to look for like a third party or...

5700
03:08:59,780 --> 03:09:01,360
Yeah we're going to look for a third party.

5701
03:09:03,200 --> 03:09:04,000
Just fly around.

5702
03:09:04,140 --> 03:09:04,500
Fly around.

5703
03:09:04,820 --> 03:09:05,680
Just fly in a circle maybe?

5704
03:09:06,520 --> 03:09:07,480
Just like fly around.

5705
03:09:07,720 --> 03:09:07,880
Yeah.

5706
03:09:07,940 --> 03:09:08,560
Fly in circles.

5707
03:09:10,040 --> 03:09:10,400
Ding.

5708
03:09:11,580 --> 03:09:12,300
Jesus Christ.

5709
03:09:13,820 --> 03:09:14,200
Land right here.

5710
03:09:14,240 --> 03:09:14,620
Land right here.

5711
03:09:15,260 --> 03:09:16,020
On the height.

5712
03:09:16,540 --> 03:09:17,720
I didn't fucking make it.

5713
03:09:17,860 --> 03:09:19,080
I'm ulting the same.

5714
03:09:19,300 --> 03:09:20,400
I make it to the height too.

5715
03:09:22,200 --> 03:09:22,840
The Bloodhound.

5716
03:09:22,840 --> 03:09:23,520
Pushing left.

5717
03:09:23,620 --> 03:09:23,840
Pushing left.

5718
03:09:24,460 --> 03:09:25,000
I'm scanning.

5719
03:09:25,800 --> 03:09:26,620
I'm hugging this wall.

5720
03:09:27,400 --> 03:09:28,840
Push this Bloodhound.

5721
03:09:28,900 --> 03:09:29,360
Push this Bloodhound.

5722
03:09:29,380 --> 03:09:29,680
I'm ulting.

5723
03:09:29,680 --> 03:09:29,980
I'm ulting.

5724
03:09:30,040 --> 03:09:30,860
I got hit by that.

5725
03:09:30,900 --> 03:09:31,120
Fuck.

5726
03:09:31,180 --> 03:09:31,480
Okay.

5727
03:09:34,960 --> 03:09:35,760
Crack crack crack crack.

03:09:35,840 --> 03:09:36,680
Wait I don't have a bat.

5729
03:09:36,920 --> 03:09:37,340

5730
03:09:37,500 --> 03:09:37,660

5731
03:09:38,100 --> 03:09:39,300

5732
03:09:39,360 --> 03:09:39,600
What is this?

5733
03:09:40,340 --> 03:09:40,900
Which one?

5734
03:09:42,280 --> 03:09:42,720
Right there.

5735
03:09:42,780 --> 03:09:42,920
Right there.

5736
03:09:42,960 --> 03:09:43,380
In front of you.

5737
03:09:43,420 --> 03:09:43,680
I got one.

5738
03:09:43,680 --> 03:09:43,800
I got one.

5739
03:09:45,000 --> 03:09:46,740
Oh I didn't see that guy.

5740
03:09:47,700 --> 03:09:48,300
Oh no.

5741
03:09:48,980 --> 03:09:49,800
No man.

5742
03:09:50,560 --> 03:09:51,080
13th.

5743
03:09:51,080 --> 03:09:52,920
Bro how many people were there?

5744
03:09:54,280 --> 03:09:55,540
There's too many people.

5745
03:09:55,540 --> 03:09:56,400
I dead slid.

5746
03:09:56,540 --> 03:09:57,060
Bro.

5747
03:09:57,980 --> 03:09:59,900
I thought they were getting shot in the back.

5748
03:10:00,140 --> 03:10:02,340
Of course it's fucking Cheeki and them.

5749
03:10:02,400 --> 03:10:02,700
Wait.

5750
03:10:02,700 --> 03:10:04,280
Where is the Bloodhound?

5751
03:10:04,560 --> 03:10:05,040
Cheeki.

5752
03:10:06,280 --> 03:10:07,820
Is Cheeki the Bloodhound?

5753
03:10:07,820 --> 03:10:08,260
No.

5754
03:10:08,320 --> 03:10:12,160
I literally clipped him with my finger ma-jig.

5755
03:10:12,300 --> 03:10:13,100
The half.

5756
03:10:13,280 --> 03:10:13,740
The half.

5757
03:10:13,740 --> 03:10:13,800
The half.

5758
03:10:13,800 --> 03:10:14,460
The headlock.

5759
03:10:14,580 --> 03:10:17,460
He was like probably like half meat.

5760
03:10:17,640 --> 03:10:20,240
And then he just turned around and just one mag me.

5761
03:10:20,380 --> 03:10:21,100
I'll fully see.

5762
03:10:21,580 --> 03:10:22,540
Bro of course.

5763
03:10:22,920 --> 03:10:25,900
Of course we landed on Cheeki man.

5764
03:10:27,280 --> 03:10:27,720
I dead slid like.

5765
03:10:27,720 --> 03:10:28,900
We could have landed on anybody.

5766
03:10:29,220 --> 03:10:30,400
It had to be Cheeki.

5767
03:10:32,040 --> 03:10:33,560
Yeah it had to be.

5768
03:10:33,820 --> 03:10:35,480
I thought they were getting shot in the back.

5769
03:10:35,680 --> 03:10:38,740
Like when we were like flying they looked like they were getting shot in the back.

5770
03:10:38,900 --> 03:10:40,360
And I almost killed their bang too.

5771
03:10:40,540 --> 03:10:42,860
I think they just finished their fight when we landed maybe.

5772
03:10:44,740 --> 03:10:45,760
I'm pretty sure.

5773
03:10:45,860 --> 03:10:46,220
Yeah.

5774
03:10:46,220 --> 03:10:48,520
Or like the team didn't like push them.

5775
03:10:48,760 --> 03:10:49,240
Yeah.

5776
03:10:50,240 --> 03:10:52,640
Oh my god of all people.

5777
03:10:52,700 --> 03:10:54,580
There was like 17 teams there.

5778
03:10:54,960 --> 03:10:55,060
Yeah.

5779
03:10:56,700 --> 03:10:58,700
We picked the bad one.

5780
03:10:58,940 --> 03:11:00,200
We picked the fucking.

5781
03:11:00,460 --> 03:11:01,780
The first place team.

5782
03:11:01,780 --> 03:11:02,740
The worst possible.

5783
03:11:04,180 --> 03:11:06,160
Our gotcha luck is terrible guys.

5784
03:11:07,000 --> 03:11:09,520
I'm just gonna watch Cheeki shit on these kids.

5785
03:11:09,740 --> 03:11:09,840
What the fuck.

5786
03:11:10,500 --> 03:11:11,280
Bro I'm just gonna watch.

5787
03:11:11,340 --> 03:11:11,860
Yeah I'm gonna watch.

5788
03:11:12,860 --> 03:11:13,300
Hello.

5789
03:11:13,320 --> 03:11:15,180

5790
03:11:15,960 --> 03:11:17,420
He has no recoil.

5791
03:11:18,040 --> 03:11:19,080
Bro it's Cheeki man.

5792
03:11:19,080 --> 03:11:20,500
He has no recoil.

5793
03:11:21,520 --> 03:11:23,800
He actually has no recoil.

5794
03:11:25,560 --> 03:11:27,960
Bro rank hardened him so hard.

5795
03:11:28,320 --> 03:11:28,960
Bro rank hardened him so hard.

5796
03:11:28,960 --> 03:11:30,540
Dude he's literally getting ammo like.

5797
03:11:30,800 --> 03:11:32,080
He's getting fed.

5798
03:11:32,500 --> 03:11:34,400
And he's like oh what the fuck.

5799
03:11:34,400 --> 03:11:35,100
Bro what the.

5800
03:11:36,260 --> 03:11:37,800
What's the difference of this.

5801
03:11:38,320 --> 03:11:39,260
He's so good.

5802
03:11:39,700 --> 03:11:41,080
He's so good.

5803
03:11:41,420 --> 03:11:42,580
What's the difference.

5804
03:11:42,860 --> 03:11:44,660
Bro of course he's on Bloodhound.

5805
03:11:44,780 --> 03:11:46,780
The roller player is always on Bloodhound.

5806
03:11:49,380 --> 03:11:49,860
Bro.

5807
03:11:50,480 --> 03:11:50,960
Bro.

5808
03:11:51,020 --> 03:11:51,300
Bro there's no.

5809
03:11:51,440 --> 03:11:52,500
I can't compare to that.

5810
03:11:54,520 --> 03:11:56,000
This dude literally just.

5811
03:11:56,800 --> 03:11:59,200
180s and just headshots me five times in a row.

5812
03:12:00,060 --> 03:12:01,440
What am I supposed to do.

5813
03:12:02,000 --> 03:12:02,480
Nothing.

5814
03:12:02,740 --> 03:12:04,540
You just roll over and die.

5815
03:12:05,360 --> 03:12:06,840
You show your stomach.

5816
03:12:07,040 --> 03:12:07,720
And you're like.

5817
03:12:08,680 --> 03:12:10,300
Dude he's running out.

5818
03:12:10,300 --> 03:12:12,120
Dude he's an ape.

5819
03:12:12,460 --> 03:12:14,920
What an ape.

5820
03:12:15,200 --> 03:12:16,340
What an ape.

5821
03:12:16,700 --> 03:12:17,620
Is he gonna win?

5822
03:12:17,720 --> 03:12:18,380
Bro is he gonna win again?

5823
03:12:19,040 --> 03:12:21,700
No way.

5824
03:12:22,340 --> 03:12:23,560
They winning again.

5825
03:12:24,000 --> 03:12:25,660
Oh my god.

5826
03:12:25,760 --> 03:12:28,180
That fucking gipy bubble saved their life.

5827
03:12:30,680 --> 03:12:31,440
Holy fuck.

5828
03:12:31,440 --> 03:12:32,460
Holy fuck.

5829
03:12:33,180 --> 03:12:34,420
He can't miss.

5830
03:12:36,620 --> 03:12:37,940
He can't miss.

5831
03:12:38,400 --> 03:12:39,100
No.

5832
03:12:40,300 --> 03:12:41,040
He won't miss.

5833
03:12:41,040 --> 03:12:41,440
What?

5834
03:12:43,700 --> 03:12:44,920
That's not fair.

5835
03:12:45,340 --> 03:12:45,880
No.

5836
03:12:46,340 --> 03:12:49,320
I wish Valk ult.

5837
03:12:49,540 --> 03:12:52,480
They tell you which team you're landing on.

5838
03:12:55,400 --> 03:12:57,760
If I knew it was cheeky.

5839
03:12:57,820 --> 03:12:58,620
I would not have landed there.

5840
03:12:58,740 --> 03:12:59,800
I would fucking left.

5841
03:13:03,300 --> 03:13:04,600
It's not fair man.

5842
03:13:04,680 --> 03:13:07,400
Fourth first place is in a row.

5843
03:13:08,060 --> 03:13:08,620
Bro.

5844
03:13:10,300 --> 03:13:11,760
They've won every single one right?

5845
03:13:11,880 --> 03:13:13,560
They won every single trio.

5846
03:13:14,080 --> 03:13:15,840
Every trio they've won.

5847
03:13:16,100 --> 03:13:17,180
Bro check his controller.

5848
03:13:18,740 --> 03:13:19,480
Yeah dude.

5849
03:13:19,640 --> 03:13:21,680
His controller is like taking some.

5850
03:13:21,680 --> 03:13:23,220
Bro what controller does he use?

5851
03:13:23,360 --> 03:13:24,480
Let me buy it.

5852
03:13:25,980 --> 03:13:27,240
What place for me?

5853
03:13:27,440 --> 03:13:28,600
13th with one kill.

5854
03:13:29,320 --> 03:13:30,260
That's not bad.

5855
03:13:30,400 --> 03:13:31,260
We got points.

5856
03:13:31,640 --> 03:13:33,760
Fucking 13 kills.

5857
03:13:33,880 --> 03:13:35,680
We died with the team that won.

5858
03:13:36,160 --> 03:13:36,720
Yeah.

5859
03:13:36,720 --> 03:13:38,080
That doesn't count.

5860
03:13:38,200 --> 03:13:38,960
We're like second place.

5861
03:13:39,220 --> 03:13:40,520
It doesn't count.

5862
03:13:40,860 --> 03:13:41,920
We landed on them.

5863
03:13:42,100 --> 03:13:44,420
We were the only team to contest them.

5864
03:13:44,580 --> 03:13:46,880
We were the only team that stood up and were like no.

5865
03:13:47,120 --> 03:13:50,040
We are going to 1v1 you guys.

5866
03:13:50,520 --> 03:13:51,240
Come at us.

5867
03:13:51,420 --> 03:13:55,020
I'm pretty sure the other team is just fucking also trying to kill them and die.

5868
03:13:55,540 --> 03:13:55,680
Yeah.

5869
03:13:59,720 --> 03:14:01,040
Oh my god.

5870
03:14:01,120 --> 03:14:02,320
That team was insane.

5871
03:14:02,320 --> 03:14:04,000
Holy shit.

5872
03:14:04,020 --> 03:14:05,820
Bro check his computer man.

5873
03:14:07,420 --> 03:14:08,720
That was fun though.

5874
03:14:08,760 --> 03:14:10,580
I had a great time with you guys.

5875
03:14:10,760 --> 03:14:12,740
I had an amazing time.

5876
03:14:13,080 --> 03:14:14,880
Bro we should play Overwatch together.

5877
03:14:15,380 --> 03:14:15,640
You should.

5878
03:14:15,720 --> 03:14:16,940
Taya should carry him.

5879
03:14:18,060 --> 03:14:19,720
It's Taya's turn to carry him.

5880
03:14:20,160 --> 03:14:20,840
Yeah wait.

5881
03:14:21,340 --> 03:14:23,900
You should be in Overwatch now.

5882
03:14:24,260 --> 03:14:26,040
Yeah Taya next time.

5883
03:14:26,180 --> 03:14:27,640
You guys gotta carry.

5884
03:14:29,080 --> 03:14:30,620
Get your revenge.

5885
03:14:30,840 --> 03:14:32,300
Get your revenge on fucking Taya.

5886
03:14:33,360 --> 03:14:33,860
Yeah.

5887
03:14:34,140 --> 03:14:36,060
Help your reese get to Diamond.

5888
03:14:36,440 --> 03:14:38,080
Can we get Cheeki in here?

5889
03:14:38,280 --> 03:14:40,740
Get Cheeki into the team.

5890
03:14:41,220 --> 03:14:41,340
Yeah get him.

5891
03:14:44,120 --> 03:14:45,120
1v1 Taya.

5892
03:14:46,080 --> 03:14:46,800
In Overwatch.

5893
03:14:46,820 --> 03:14:47,060
In Overwatch.

5894
03:14:49,300 --> 03:14:51,360
There is no aim assist there.

5895
03:14:52,420 --> 03:14:52,600
There is no aim assist there.

5896
03:14:52,840 --> 03:14:55,840
But he is like immortal 3 in Valorant 2.

5897
03:14:56,040 --> 03:14:56,420
But he is like immortal 3 in Valorant 2.

5898
03:14:56,420 --> 03:14:57,320
Bro he is immortal 3?

5899
03:14:57,540 --> 03:15:00,440
Yeah he is actually good in Valorant as well.

5900
03:15:00,620 --> 03:15:01,140
Bro wait.

5901
03:15:02,320 --> 03:15:03,940
He might win the 1v1 Taya.

5902
03:15:04,040 --> 03:15:05,320
He might be better than you in Overwatch.

5903
03:15:06,140 --> 03:15:07,020
Probably not.

5904
03:15:07,220 --> 03:15:08,100
I think I'm fine.

5905
03:15:08,300 --> 03:15:09,280
I think I'm fine.

5906
03:15:11,460 --> 03:15:12,560
Don't worry about that.

5907
03:15:15,860 --> 03:15:16,300
GG's.

5908
03:15:16,400 --> 03:15:18,680
Let's see what placement we got.

5909
03:15:18,980 --> 03:15:19,260
Oh yeah.

5910
03:15:20,120 --> 03:15:21,620
Let's see what placement we got.

5911
03:15:21,620 --> 03:15:22,580
Isn't there like a mainstream?

5912
03:15:23,360 --> 03:15:24,500
Yeah there should be.

5913
03:15:26,280 --> 03:15:28,140
Where is the Skars mainstream?

5914
03:15:29,440 --> 03:15:30,000
Skars Cup.

5915
03:15:30,000 --> 03:15:31,760
I think they are doing an interview right now.

5916
03:15:32,340 --> 03:15:33,620
With Cheeki?

5917
03:15:33,840 --> 03:15:34,840
Yeah Cheeki.

5918
03:15:35,060 --> 03:15:37,760
The immortal god.

5919
03:15:38,200 --> 03:15:39,920
The 4 first places.

5920
03:15:41,100 --> 03:15:43,800
I'm pretty sure he is the god of Apex.

5921
03:15:44,080 --> 03:15:44,520
If anyone.

5922
03:15:46,220 --> 03:15:47,600
No no that's...

5923
03:15:47,600 --> 03:15:50,580
I mean maybe he is the CEO in Japan.

5924
03:15:51,500 --> 03:15:52,760
The CEO in Japan.

5925
03:15:53,100 --> 03:15:53,580
The CEO.

5926
03:15:54,180 --> 03:15:55,280
Yeah exactly.

5927
03:15:57,220 --> 03:15:58,820
We have Hal and NN.

5928
03:15:58,820 --> 03:16:01,860
Apparently there is like a random hat winner.

5929
03:16:02,140 --> 03:16:02,900
Oh yeah yeah.

5930
03:16:03,060 --> 03:16:07,100
They pull like a piece of paper to see who gets it.

5931
03:16:07,300 --> 03:16:07,900
And then...

5932
03:16:09,020 --> 03:16:09,900
Yeah yeah yeah.

5933
03:16:10,080 --> 03:16:11,080
So like we could...

5934
03:16:11,080 --> 03:16:13,260
Maybe you know we don't have luck here.

5935
03:16:13,460 --> 03:16:15,020
But we have luck in the gacha.

5936
03:16:15,220 --> 03:16:15,660
That is true.

5937
03:16:16,200 --> 03:16:17,240
It's all about the gacha.

5938
03:16:17,660 --> 03:16:21,440
I'm getting off though once we get our leaderboard.

5939
03:16:21,660 --> 03:16:22,700
I'm sick right now.

5940
03:16:23,080 --> 03:16:23,900
Oh shit.

5941
03:16:23,900 --> 03:16:24,980
From yesterday.

5942
03:16:28,820 --> 03:16:30,320
I didn't sleep until like 6am.

5943
03:16:30,620 --> 03:16:32,580
Bro what you came in here with no sleep?

5944
03:16:34,880 --> 03:16:37,200
This man was out partying.

5945
03:16:38,440 --> 03:16:40,180
That's where it gets us in the beginning.

5946
03:16:41,320 --> 03:16:41,800
Yeah.

5947
03:16:42,100 --> 03:16:42,760
I'm sorry.

5948
03:16:44,520 --> 03:16:45,140
It's okay.

5949
03:16:45,500 --> 03:16:48,600
You know we got 3rd place even with all the debuffs.

5950
03:16:48,780 --> 03:16:50,120
In that last game.

5951
03:16:50,380 --> 03:16:53,320
With all that debuffs we still got 3rd in that last game.

5952
03:16:54,740 --> 03:16:55,860
That's all that matters.

5953
03:16:56,240 --> 03:16:57,340
Oh they are still watching.

5954
03:16:59,180 --> 03:16:59,720
Yeah.

5955
03:16:59,880 --> 03:17:01,400
This dude just kills 3 people.

5956
03:17:01,740 --> 03:17:04,400
He just kills 4 people in a row.

5957
03:17:04,620 --> 03:17:04,800
You know.

5958
03:17:04,940 --> 03:17:07,360
This is a normal Tuesday.

5959
03:17:07,720 --> 03:17:09,800
Just normal cheeky days.

5960
03:17:10,440 --> 03:17:12,080
That's like a little ranked game.

5961
03:17:12,300 --> 03:17:15,040
Yeah this man plays ranked even when there's hackers every day.

5962
03:17:15,660 --> 03:17:17,780
Yeah cause he's stronger than them.

5963
03:17:17,840 --> 03:17:19,660
He's stronger than the hackers.

5964
03:17:22,320 --> 03:17:23,340
He's just better.

5965
03:17:26,140 --> 03:17:28,240
At least we know we're not last.

5966
03:17:28,460 --> 03:17:29,600
That's all that matters.

5967
03:17:30,180 --> 03:17:31,220
Not last.

5968
03:17:31,340 --> 03:17:32,020
Let's go.

5969
03:17:32,140 --> 03:17:33,900
Not last equals win.

5970
03:17:35,180 --> 03:17:36,320
Placements don't matter.

5971
03:17:36,320 --> 03:17:38,460
It's only first and last place.

5972
03:17:39,640 --> 03:17:41,160
And we weren't last.

5973
03:17:41,200 --> 03:17:42,700
Technically we can be second.

5974
03:17:46,300 --> 03:17:47,280
What is...

5975
03:17:48,520 --> 03:17:50,200
We're in 14th place.

5976
03:17:50,780 --> 03:17:52,020
We're in 14th place.

5977
03:17:52,020 --> 03:17:52,360
Almost.

5978
03:17:53,020 --> 03:17:54,060
Not last.

5979
03:17:54,200 --> 03:17:54,460
That's all.

5980
03:17:55,280 --> 03:17:55,620
We're better than...

5981
03:17:56,320 --> 03:17:58,620
Look at all these other people we're better than.

5982
03:18:01,400 --> 03:18:02,140
It's alright.

5983
03:18:02,920 --> 03:18:03,440
Nice.

5984
03:18:04,180 --> 03:18:06,980
We're not that far from top...

5985
03:18:06,980 --> 03:18:08,280
Top 5.

5986
03:18:09,140 --> 03:18:10,020
Top 5 yeah.

5987
03:18:11,480 --> 03:18:14,480
If we got the kill points from that other game.

5988
03:18:14,640 --> 03:18:17,080
I think we would be like 8 or 9.

5989
03:18:17,580 --> 03:18:18,000
Yeah.

5990
03:18:18,180 --> 03:18:22,900
If we didn't land on cheeky's team we could have been top 10.

5991
03:18:23,020 --> 03:18:24,280
We could have been top 10.

5992
03:18:25,280 --> 03:18:25,980
It could have been.

5993
03:18:26,180 --> 03:18:29,620
There's like 3 people that have 24 points.

5994
03:18:29,800 --> 03:18:30,480
Holy fuck.

5995
03:18:32,660 --> 03:18:33,820
Oh my god.

5996
03:18:34,280 --> 03:18:36,060
Hey you got your estimate right.

5997
03:18:36,160 --> 03:18:39,420
You were like 14th to 15th place.

5998
03:18:39,500 --> 03:18:40,020
You got it right.

5999
03:18:40,820 --> 03:18:42,380
You read us perfectly.

6000
03:18:42,420 --> 03:18:43,540
What can I say man.

6001
03:18:45,180 --> 03:18:46,600
You read us perfectly.

6002
03:18:49,000 --> 03:18:50,380
We did it guys.

6003
03:18:50,940 --> 03:18:51,800
Thank you guys.

6004
03:18:51,800 --> 03:18:53,560
That was... I enjoyed that a lot.

6005
03:18:53,720 --> 03:18:54,600
Yeah me too.

6006
03:18:55,840 --> 03:18:56,420
GG's.

6007
03:18:56,960 --> 03:18:58,020
Next time.

6008
03:18:58,020 --> 03:19:01,040
Next time Tayo carries us in Overwatch.

6009
03:19:01,680 --> 03:19:04,320
Next time it's Overwatch we might carry you guys.

6010
03:19:04,440 --> 03:19:04,720
Yeah yeah.

6011
03:19:04,760 --> 03:19:06,680
Boost your ease to...

6012
03:19:07,380 --> 03:19:08,500
Wait wait wait.

6013
03:19:09,100 --> 03:19:10,420
Whoa whoa boost.

6014
03:19:10,960 --> 03:19:12,360
Mercy pocket with Mercy.

6015
03:19:14,140 --> 03:19:15,020
Damage boost.

6016
03:19:15,780 --> 03:19:16,740
That's what I'm saying.

6017
03:19:17,400 --> 03:19:18,300
Damage boost.

6018
03:19:18,580 --> 03:19:19,640
As Mercy.

6019
03:19:21,800 --> 03:19:23,420
You have your supports like gold right?

6020
03:19:23,880 --> 03:19:25,000
Yeah yeah yeah.

6021
03:19:25,520 --> 03:19:28,880
Yeah you just play Mercy and damage boost your ease.

6022
03:19:29,420 --> 03:19:30,800
Yeah boost him.

6023
03:19:31,020 --> 03:19:31,360
Yeah.

6024
03:19:31,400 --> 03:19:32,820
Yeah boost him.

6025
03:19:33,040 --> 03:19:33,560
Damage boost.

6026
03:19:35,020 --> 03:19:38,120
For legal reasons I meant damage boost.

6027
03:19:38,380 --> 03:19:39,720
Not anything else.

6028
03:19:40,200 --> 03:19:41,360
Not anything else.

6029
03:19:41,360 --> 03:19:43,660
I don't even know anything else but damage boost.

6030
03:19:43,740 --> 03:19:44,320
Yeah exactly.

6031
03:19:44,520 --> 03:19:45,300
You don't need heals.

6032
03:19:45,380 --> 03:19:47,860
A true Mercy player knows it's all about damage boosting.

6033
03:19:48,380 --> 03:19:48,940
Yeah.

6034
03:19:49,200 --> 03:19:51,700
He doesn't need heals if he kills everybody.

6035
03:19:51,800 --> 03:19:53,980
He has... yeah they have regen now.

6036
03:19:54,160 --> 03:19:55,260
Overwatch players can eat regen.

6037
03:19:55,740 --> 03:19:57,540
Yeah like you don't even need heals.

6038
03:19:57,680 --> 03:19:58,560
Yeah you don't even...

6039
03:19:59,140 --> 03:20:01,240
Wait was that not a thing before?

6040
03:20:01,440 --> 03:20:03,560

6044
03:20:12,960 --> 03:20:13,500

Yeah so don't worry.

6048
03:20:17,940 --> 03:20:19,240
You don't need heals.

6049
03:20:19,240 --> 03:20:20,680
You just wait for your regen.

6050
03:20:22,640 --> 03:20:23,200
Alright.

6051
03:20:23,340 --> 03:20:24,140

That was my first time like interacting with your ease and Taya in game.

6066
03:20:47,320 --> 03:20:48,120
That was so fun.

6067
03:20:50,080 --> 03:20:52,540
We were so close to top 10.

6068
03:20:52,840 --> 03:20:53,740
We were literally...

6069
03:20:53,740 --> 03:20:56,460
Literally top 10 was 3 points away.

6070
03:20:56,820 --> 03:20:58,120
It was so crazy.

6071
03:20:58,120 --> 03:21:00,760
Everyone was so fucking congested together.

6072
03:21:01,020 --> 03:21:03,080
If I didn't get the blue screen.

6073
03:21:03,740 --> 03:21:05,420
If I didn't get the blue screen.

6074
03:21:05,420 --> 03:21:06,980
It was the blue screen.

6075
03:21:07,720 --> 03:21:07,760
It was the blue screen.

6076
03:21:07,760 --> 03:21:10,640
I still can't believe I got the blue screen.

6077
03:21:10,920 --> 03:21:11,100
I still can't believe I got the blue screen.

6078
03:21:11,100 --> 03:21:12,840
That's so fucked up.

6081
03:21:20,460 --> 03:21:23,640
I couldn't read super chats while streaming.

6082
03:21:23,880 --> 03:21:25,480
But thank you again Tommy.

6083
03:21:25,880 --> 03:21:26,660
Not when I'm streaming.

6084

When I'm doing collab.

6085
03:21:29,420 --> 03:21:31,900
Sometimes I'm not able to read super chats.

6086
03:21:32,040 --> 03:21:33,100
But thank you so much.

We were so close.

6094
03:21:41,460 --> 03:21:44,460
We could have actually got top 10 if I didn't blue screen.

6095
03:21:45,120 --> 03:21:45,920
The curse.

6096
03:21:45,920 --> 03:21:47,700
I got cursed by Tayo.

6097
03:21:49,620 --> 03:21:52,340
I actually got cursed by Tayo.

6098
03:21:53,500 --> 03:21:55,380
It's like crazy man.

6099
03:21:59,900 --> 03:22:01,400
But yeah anyway.

Playing with them.

6102
03:22:04,580 --> 03:22:05,800
I had a great time.

6103
03:22:06,620 --> 03:22:09,460
That was my first JP tournament back here.

6104
03:22:09,520 --> 03:22:10,180
As Doki.

6105
03:22:11,620 --> 03:22:13,500
I'm really happy that they invited me.

6106
03:22:13,740 --> 03:22:17,740
And I'm really happy that it was fun just messing around.

6107
03:22:17,880 --> 03:22:18,600
Just talking.

6108
03:22:18,840 --> 03:22:19,500

By the way.

6111
03:22:22,780 --> 03:22:25,920
We have not fucking practiced.

6112
03:22:26,640 --> 03:22:27,480
At all.

6113
03:22:27,500 --> 03:22:28,060
As a team.

6114
03:22:28,380 --> 03:22:30,180
Because everybody's busy.

6115
03:22:31,060 --> 03:22:33,720
I gave them my schedule too.

6116
03:22:34,300 --> 03:22:35,120

6118
03:22:36,660 --> 03:22:39,160
As long as I can do it before my streams.

6119
03:22:39,280 --> 03:22:39,900
That's really good.

6120
03:22:40,780 --> 03:22:43,200
And then we're supposed to practice today.

6121
03:22:44,080 --> 03:22:45,200

Or like on my rest day.

6124
03:22:49,080 --> 03:22:50,940
And then the thing is.

6125
03:22:51,200 --> 03:22:52,220
The thing was.

6126
03:22:53,880 --> 03:22:55,460
We don't know what happened to Wig.

6127
03:22:55,640 --> 03:22:56,540
He disappeared.

6128
03:22:57,480 --> 03:22:58,480
He actually.

6129
03:22:58,760 --> 03:23:00,760
We don't know what happened to him.

6130
03:23:00,980 --> 03:23:02,780
He like never showed up.

6132
03:23:04,580 --> 03:23:05,520

Are you ready?

6135
03:23:07,340 --> 03:23:08,400

6136
03:23:08,480 --> 03:23:09,580
I'm ready to play.

6137
03:23:10,400 --> 03:23:11,200
Where's Wig?

6138
03:23:11,300 --> 03:23:12,000
And then he never.

6139
03:23:12,180 --> 03:23:13,720
We don't know what happened to him.

6140
03:23:13,900 --> 03:23:15,440
And then we had like somebody.

6141
03:23:15,920 --> 03:23:16,520
Like text him.

6142
03:23:16,660 --> 03:23:17,840

03:23:18,120 --> 03:23:18,760
So they're like.

6144
03:23:18,880 --> 03:23:19,940
Hey where are you?

6145
03:23:20,020 --> 03:23:21,060
And he never responded.

6146
03:23:21,700 --> 03:23:23,280
And then like.

6147
03:23:23,640 --> 03:23:25,500
Yeah he had like 3 hours of sleep.

6148
03:23:25,560 --> 03:23:26,540
So I think he's fucking out.

6149
03:23:26,760 --> 03:23:27,140
And I'm like.

6150
03:23:27,220 --> 03:23:27,420

03:23:35,140 --> 03:23:36,040
The day before.

6157
03:23:36,720 --> 03:23:37,860
The day before yesterday.

6158
03:23:38,140 --> 03:23:39,000
But then Wig was like.

6159
03:23:39,060 --> 03:23:39,680
I can't make it.

6160
03:23:39,680 --> 03:23:40,180
Can we do that?

6161
03:23:40,200 --> 03:23:41,300
