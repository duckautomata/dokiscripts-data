1
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:49,870
That was mean.

2
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:51,870
Whoa!

3
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,670
Anyway, whoa!

4
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,570
Hey everybody!

5
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:03,890
Oh my god, sorry I had to push back the stream a little bit earlier.

6
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:07,650
Because I woke up and it was like... work.

7
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:15,310
It was just like... Doki, work messages!

8
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,570
And I was like...

9
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,390
I was just like...

10
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:33,910
So I had to push back the stream a little bit.

11
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:37,210
Because I had to deal with work stuff.

12
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,010
Oh my god.

13
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,810
Every day is so, so, so, so busy.

14
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:46,550
It's been a busy, busy, busy time for me.

15
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:49,710
But yeah...

16
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:50,630
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

17
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:51,930
For those who don't follow me.

18
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,470
My Twitch adventures.

19
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,650
We got third place!

20
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,250
Plus one.

21
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,490
Third place!

22
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,350
Plus one.

23
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:07,830
In the Pow World Twitch Rivals.

24
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,170
Yeah!

25
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:10,790
Top three!

26
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:11,370
Plus one.

27
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:19,110
Spoiler alert for those who were waiting for the VODs.

28
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:21,630
I did make a VOD channel.

29
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:25,090
I linked it on my YouTube channel.

30
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,170
But I do have a VODs channel now.

31
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:33,730
I'm so sorry for spoiling the people who were waiting for me to upload it onto VODs.

32
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:34,930
I'm so sorry.

33
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,210
But at least you can...

34
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,170
We'll be able to watch...

35
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,570
You don't know how we got top three.

36
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:40,130
You know?

37
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,770
You don't know how we got top three.

38
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,410
So you can watch the process of all of it happening.

39
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:53,890
It's not like I tweeted it out that I got top three and everything.

40
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:07,770
But yeah, I want to say a huge thank you for the people at Twitch for inviting me and everything.

41
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,290
You know what was crazy?

42
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:10,810
Like...

43
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,550
Afterwards, they actually...

44
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,130
I'm pretty sure I can talk about it.

45
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,490
I didn't say it.

46
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,830
I'm pretty sure I can talk about it.

47
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:23,110
Because it's like still in the early...

48
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,490
Like they literally asked me if I was interested.

49
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:27,170
But like...

50
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:27,910
But like...

51
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,050
Twitch was like...

52
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:32,250
Do you want to headline a Twitch Rivals?

53
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,370

55
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,370

00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,650

00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:38,350
They were like...

59
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,330

I don't know...

87
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,470
They just wanted to announce it.

88
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,210
And I was like...

89
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:09,590

92
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,590
And that sounds pretty fucking cool.

93
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:15,170
Um...

108
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,150

00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,570
Because like...

127
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:01,370

132
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,470

133
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,130

134
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:11,410

00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,640
Thank you, thank you!

196
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:04,340
Taxes, contracts, a lawyer to help with like, like sponsor, like drafting up NDAs.

197
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:07,120
I was like, drafting up NDAs?!

198
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,600
I was like, oh my god!

199
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,380
Oh my god!

200
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,040
What?!

201
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:22,820
You're like, you need a Canadian lawyer because you're Canadian.

202
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:28,120
So you're trapped that handles like business lawyer stuff with NDAs.

203
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,200
I was like, ahhh!

204
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,740
I

205
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,980
was like, oh no!

206
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,380
Anyway, so that was like...

207
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:40,780
Let's go!

208
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,840
Last night and today.

209
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,400
So I was like...

210
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,900
What does that mean?!

211
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,100
That's... I know!

212
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:53,600
Like, like Mr. Mad would send me like a whole bunch of information last night.

213
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,780
And then they're like...

214
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,920
And I was just like, I'm going to sleep.

215
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:05,080
Mr. Mad... Mr. Mad sent me like a bunch of information.

216
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,780
And I was like...

217
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,760
Cause like at first they were like, are you alive?

218
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,160
And I was like, yes.

219
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,980
And then they sent me like a ton of information.

220
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,380
Like, it was like...

221
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,660
And I replied back...

222
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,680
I'm going to sleep.

223
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,380
Future Doki will worry about that later.

224
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,920
Future Doki will worry about this another time.

225
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,220
It was like, I can't.

226
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:36,740
I'm sorry.

227
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,720
I'm so tired.

228
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,940
I can't.

229
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,800
I cannot make any decision right now.

230
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,380
And then I woke up.

231
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,680
And then it was like...

232
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,700
And I'm just like...

233
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,200
Read.

234
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,280
I was like, unread.

235
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,640
I'm just like, unread.

236
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,860
Okay, stream time.

237
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,340
Super Persona Gamer, thank you for the Akasupa.

238
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:06,920
Thank you.

239
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,580
Thank you.

240
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,080
Hey Doki, I'm still like, bringing my birthday today.

241
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,120
Can you sing when everything stays?

242
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,600
No, but I'll sing happy birthday.

243
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,980
I guess I don't know what you're talking about.

244
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,040
Thank you for the Akasupa.

245
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:23,600
Thank you.

246
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,180
Thank you.

247
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,060
Happy birthday to you.

248
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,160
Happy birthday to you.

249
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,520
Happy birthday dear Super Persona Gamer.

250
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,800
Happy birthday to you.

251
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,380
Yeah!

252
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,520
Happy birthday!

253
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:35,900
Yay!

254
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,560
You'll end up becoming your own agency at this point.

255
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,560
Thank you for the Super Chat.

256
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:40,940
Thank you.

257
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,560
Thank you.

258
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,520
Adelus, I'm sorry for future Doki.

259
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,540
Thank you for the Super Chat.

260
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:45,860
Thank you.

261
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,280
Thank you.

262
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,660
I was actually tempted to like...

263
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:56,640
Cause like, when I saw the like, giant paragraphs of like, information and stuff I had to do last night.

264
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,640
I was like, oh fuck, should I like, push back today's stream?

265
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,860
And I was just like, no, I really wanna stream.

266
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:10,780
I wanna run away from my responsibilities for one more afternoon.

267
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,780
So I'm just like, no, I will stream.

268
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:25,500
I will run away from my responsibilities and pretend that I don't have to do all of that later.

269
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:28,960
Yay!

270
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,540
Procrastinate!

271
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,700
Please don't be like me.

272
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,840
Please, please do not be like me.

273
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,800
Procrastination is a bad thing.

274
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,940
Okay guys, just, I just, I just need this.

275
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:43,520
I really, I really need this, guys.

276
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,660
I really fucking need this.

277
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,160
Alright, alright, anyway.

278
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,100
Anyway.

279
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,800
Like, I am the example of things you should not do.

280
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,820
I am, I'm basically like, I'm teaching you what you should not do.

281
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,960
What not to do, guys.

282
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:04,760
What the fuck?

283
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,660
Why isn't my controller not working?

284
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,060
Do I have to restart?

285
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,240
Fuck, okay guys, sorry.

286
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,760
I have to restart my game.

287
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:16,580
Because I accidentally, I accidentally went on M and K instead of controller.

288
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,280
And I have not learned how to play this game on mouse and keyboard.

289
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,820
She's just, no!

290
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,520
You don't wanna be just like me, for real, for real!

291
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,560
You have to be, she's just not like me, for real, for real.

292
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,360
Uh, JL, thank you for the super chat.

293
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,220
Thank you, thank you.

294
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:36,030
Uh, Delicious, thank you for the super chat.

295
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:36,910
Thank you, thank you.

296
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:39,150
Boy, do I get running away from responsibility.

297
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:39,650
No!

298
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,590
Do not run away from responsibility!

299
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,450
It is bad.

300
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,170
It is so bad.

301
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,910
Right, like right now, I'm trying to pretend I don't have all these responsibilities.

302
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,930
And it's very bad.

303
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,810
It is very, very bad, guys.

304
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,650
Guys, this is not good.

305
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:59,930
It's not good.

306
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:00,830
Okay.

307
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:05,910
I'm here, I'm the, I'm here to teach you guys how not good this is.

308
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:06,610
Um.

309
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:11,970
Alright, here, and maybe this time I'll have controller being plugged in.

310
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,290
Come on, Batman.

311
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:19,270
Why can't I just be a billionaire so I never have to care about payroll?

312
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:28,590
If I was a billionaire, I'll have so much fucking money that I won't even care.

313
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:34,930
They'll be like, they won't, they can like, basically, they'll like, write down that I'm paying them like 100k an hour.

314
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:36,110
And I wouldn't care.

315
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:37,750
I only have 24%.

316
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,150
I played 5 hours.

317
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:42,430
And I had 24%?

318
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:47,530
But anyway, if I was a billionaire, I would not have to care about payroll.

319
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:51,250
Because they can literally write 100k a day or some shit and I won't care.

320
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,510
Because I'll make back 100k in a day.

321
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,730
Like, they can do whatever the fuck they want.

322
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,290
But sadly, I'm just an anime girl.

323
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,310
I'm just an anime girl.

324
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,530
I can't care.

325
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:08,910
I have to actually care.

326
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,560
Where am I supposed to go?

327
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,920
We're in the tunnel?

328
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,060
Whoa!

329
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,680
Oh shit, he has a gun.

330
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,940
I just remember how to play.

331
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:27,620
No!

332
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,260
Shit!

333
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,260
It's okay!

334
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,880
He can't kill me forever!

335
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,560
Oh, they all have guns!

336
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,400
Oh, nevermind!

337
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,420
No!

338
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,760
My one weakness!

339
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:39,580
Guns!

340
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:41,780
It's okay.

341
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,380
It's alright.

342
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,540
I didn't realize they all had guns.

343
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,260
Oh, guys!

344
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:46,840
Look at this.

345
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,540
There's no flashes now.

346
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,980
You see that?

347
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,460
Because I can run mods.

348
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,480
Shoutout to that one Dragoon that linked me, like, the mods thing.

349
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,640
Where...

350
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,880
It actually disables flash.

351
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,260
Oh shit.

352
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,460
Get me back up.

353
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,180
Get me up there.

354
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:07,760
Get me up there.

355
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,160
There's no flashbang anymore.

356
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,460
Thank fucking god.

357
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,640
Holy shit.

358
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:20,520
Yeah, a Dragoon linked me to a mod that, like, basically disables, like, all the flashbangs.

359
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,980
And thank fucking god.

360
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:22,640
Oh my god.

361
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,240
I'm so happy.

362
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,460
Wee.

363
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,220
There's no way I can miss.

364
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,610
Please don't look up.

365
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,350
Guys, no, this is...

366
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,590
Guys, I just need you guys to know.

367
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:44,870
This is very strategic because I purposely made them all together so it's like bullying again.

368
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:47,430
Please.

369
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:50,910
Please.

370
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:52,730
Okay, wait, wait.

371
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:53,870
I'm lining them up, guys!

372
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,730
I'm lining them up, everybody!

373
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,370
Okay?

374
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:00,250
They're all perfectly lined up now.

375
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,590
And like...

376
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,410
Okay, here you go.

377
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,750
Here we go.

378
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:06,870
I swear to fucking...

379
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,090
I swear...

380
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:08,550
Shit!

381
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:11,610
No!

382
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:15,010
Please!

383
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,250
Okay.

384
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,610
All right.

385
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:19,430
Now...

386
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:22,010
Now they'll be perfectly lined up.

387
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,550
Watch this.

388
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,130
It's like bullying.

389
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,170
There's no way.

390
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,390
I...

391
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,630
I...

392
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:33,090
I...

393
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:38,130
I don't know anymore.

394
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:40,770
No!

395
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,590
I thought you'd last longer.

396
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:48,650
Look!

397
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:54,050
Look is it a bad time to tell you guys that I'm not very good at bullying?

398
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:55,390
Is that...

399
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,690
Hunter thank you for this super chat.

400
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:58,310
Thank you.

401
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:58,810
Thank you.

402
00:18:58,970 --> 00:18:59,830
Is it...

403
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:04,490
Is it a bad time to admit that I was never good at bullying?

404
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:11,630
Bullying.

405
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,530
Bullying is a lot harder than expected.

406
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,690
Bullying is just as hard as IRL.

407
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,810
Okay, this time.

408
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,290
No way.

409
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,770
At least let me hit one guy.

410
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,470
That's all I ask for.

411
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,790
Please don't look up.

412
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:32,990
I swear to God.

413
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:35,530
Please don't look up.

414
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,790
Wait, how did he get up so fast?

415
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,550
I don't understand.

416
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,130
I swear to God.

417
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,950
I hate this game.

418
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,670
I hate this game.

419
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,030
Are you fucking... Okay.

420
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:55,790
Alright, we're gonna...

421
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,450
Okay, we're gonna do this.

422
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,270
We're gonna do stealth mode.

423
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:00,210
I might be able to stealth this.

424
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:06,530
It's stealth.

425
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,570
It's almost stealth.

426
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,140
It's almost stealth!

427
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,940
I did it, guys.

428
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,840
Oh, it was that easy.

429
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:30,660
Alright.

430
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,980
Thank you, Melissa for the chat.

431
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:32,320
Thank you.

432
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:32,680
Thank you.

433
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,980
Finally a streamer that isn't too lazy to install mods.

434
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:39,380
It's not that we're too lazy to install mods.

435
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,600
It's that we're not allowed to.

436
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,300
Because it's a mod.

437
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,480
Because then we would have to like ask...

438
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,680
Like a lot of times people are like...

439
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,480
It's a mod.

440
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,040
It modified the games.

441
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,960
And usually it wouldn't...

442
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,520
They would be like, no.

443
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,460
But this time...

444
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,560
Because like...

445
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,480
I guess now I'm my own boss.

446
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,340
I don't have to ask anybody.

447
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,560
I don't have to ask anybody.

448
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,100
Look.

449
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:09,520
See?

450
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,280
I can stealth.

451
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,900
I got this.

452
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,060
Thank you for the super chat.

453
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:14,440
Thank you.

454
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:14,940
Thank you.

455
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,420
Alright.

456
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,140
Here.

457
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,140
I don't know where to go.

458
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,860
Where am I supposed to go?

459
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,760
Why is there a question mark?

460
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,280
Okay.

461
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:26,740
The...

462
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,040
Tomato soup.

463
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,220
Ah, BEEAM!

464
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:29,960
Thank you for the...

465
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,500
Aka soup!

466
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:31,900
Thank you.

467
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,240
Thank you.

468
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:32,820
Thank you.

469
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,140
Thank you.

470
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,140
Wait.

471
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,640
What are these question marks?

472
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,620
Are these all the rhythm-y dis shit?

473
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,140
Must be.

474
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:42,900
What is this?

475
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,380
Warden's mansion.

476
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,140
Obtain.

477
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:45,620
Destroy.

478
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,760
Obtain the security key codes from the warden.

479
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,220
Locate the warden.

480
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,020
Did I...

481
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,600
Did I not have the security key?

482
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:00,830
Did I not have the security key?

483
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:02,090
What the fuck was I doing?

484
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:04,210
Wait.

485
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:04,870
Did I...

486
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:06,990
Did I get the security key?

487
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,370
I don't remember.

488
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:10,890
Find.

489
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:11,430
Locate.

490
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:12,670
Okay.

491
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:15,010
Oh, wait.

492
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:16,430
I just need to find the...

493
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:16,750
Okay.

494
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,010
I'm just gonna follow the bloodstains.

495
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:19,150
Alright.

496
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:20,370
Here I go.

497
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:24,670
Is there anybody here?

498
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,160
Oh, shit.

499
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:33,940
No, don't.

500
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,020
He might be into it.

501
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,770
Oh, the TV.

502
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:42,070
Oh.

503
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:42,850
Damn it.

504
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:43,490
It was too late.

505
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,410
It was too late for the spanking.

506
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:47,490
God damn it.

507
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,700
Oh, my God.

508
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,740
God damn it.

509
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,600
That's too distracted.

510
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:58,760
Alright.

511
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,100
Let's go.

512
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,480
We gotta find the warden.

513
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:02,780
Here we go.

514
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:05,920
I...

515
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,460
I...

516
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:06,500
I...

517
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:06,980
I've like...

518
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,360
I've been...

519
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,580
I was like thinking about...

520
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:08,680
Wait.

521
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:08,980
Who's that?

522
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,220
Oh, he...

523
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:11,620
Is he dead?

524
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:15,300
I...

525
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,440
And off it goes.

526
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:17,800
I...

527
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,740
I...

528
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:18,960
I...

529
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,220
I...

530
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,280
I...

531
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,600
Maybe I'll find somebody randomly.

532
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,220
You know...

533
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:29,030
I crashed the game.

534
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:37,970
Guys, it went too far.

535
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,320
It's just too...

536
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,440
The Bataran traveled way too far, guys.

537
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,720
The Bataran...

538
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,740
The Bataran...

539
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,560
The Bataran...

540
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,120
The Bataran...

541
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:00,680
The Bataran...

542
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,940
It went too far out of bounds.

543
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:03,900
Six.

544
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:04,860
Thank you, LuciferChat.

545
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,260
Thank you.

546
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:05,940
Thank you.

547
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,440
Doki is truly a scattered brain burp.

548
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,260
Thank you, LuciferChat.

549
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:09,660
Thank you.

550
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,260
Thank you.

551
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,600
Oh, my God.

552
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,440
It traveled out of game.

553
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,420
They're like, you can't do this.

554
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:15,860
Yeah.

555
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,780
Bataran was never meant to travel this far.

556
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:20,960
Yeah.

557
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:21,900
It went so far.

558
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:22,900
It just quit the game.

559
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,320
It went further...

560
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,860
It went further beyond.

561
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,120
Oh, my God.

562
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:30,660
Did you guys see that?

563
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:40,280
Did you guys hear that, like, they wanted to make a Batman Beyond animated film in the same... from the same studios that did the Spider-Verse movies?

564
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,900
And then Warner Brothers was like, no.

565
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,480
Like, they had, like...

566
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,400
Like, they drafted, like, storyboards and everything.

567
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:53,300
And then Warner Brothers was like, no.

568
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:54,840
Yeah!

569
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,520
I was looking at the artwork for it.

570
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,140
It looks so good.

571
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,450
It looks so bad.

572
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,650
Oh, that's why there's wheelchairs everywhere.

573
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:13,430
Oh.

574
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:19,590
Okay, where is these fingerprints going?

575
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:20,150
This way.

576
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:23,090
What are...

577
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:30,130
I mean, like, I'm honestly not surprised because Warner Brothers has been, like, you know, shelving a lot of stuff down.

578
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:34,030
So, like, are you guys really surprised, though, that this side is shelving?

579
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:34,130
Shove it.

580
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:38,090
They've been like shelving a lot of projects in general.

581
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,550
So it's not like the first time.

582
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:43,070
I can just...

583
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:51,590
What?

584
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:57,670
Did you do it?

585
00:25:59,010 --> 00:25:59,570
Woah!

586
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,310
What the fuck?

587
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:15,430
Bro, you could've just killed a random girl!

588
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:30,510
Bro, that guy could've just killed a random girl instead of his sister.

589
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:31,330
He doesn't care.

590
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:32,830
He just hates women, I guess.

591
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:39,790
Alright, well, there's one... there's no way.

592
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:40,690
Come on.

593
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:42,370
NO!

594
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:43,270
FUCK!

595
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:44,310
Okay, I'm gonna go ahead!

596
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:45,930
Woah!

597
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:46,630
There's no way!

598
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:47,550
You!

599
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:48,650
YOU!

600
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:52,030
Get me... get me out of here.

601
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:52,790
Okay.

602
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:54,630
There you go!

603
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:54,890
It's fine.

604
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:55,190
It's fine.

605
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:57,310
I just needed to get rid of the guns.

606
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:58,470
OH GOD!

607
00:26:58,530 --> 00:26:59,330
Okay, it's fine.

608
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:00,870
I still remember how to dodge.

609
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:03,430
I just got rid of the guns.

610
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,070
Oh shit!

611
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:07,330
Oh fuck him!

612
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:08,950
Okay.

613
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:10,250
No gun.

614
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,150
Ow.

615
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:13,810
It's okay I can regen.

616
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:14,370
No!

617
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:16,170
How is he getting guns again?!

618
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:19,930
Stop!

619
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,210
That's illegal!

620
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:25,350
Picking up a gun from the floor?

621
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:27,050
That's so illegal!

622
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:32,170
If I can't pick up a random gun on the floor, you can't either.

623
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,670
Because they can pick up... No!

624
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:38,830
If it touches the floor, it's like a five second rule.

625
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:41,030
And five seconds is already gone.

626
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:48,030
So like... what's the point of having a five second rule if they can just pick up a gun after five seconds?

627
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:48,910
Like, come on.

628
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,010
That's not fair.

629
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:54,950
The floor is like... exactly.

630
00:27:55,530 --> 00:28:01,990
Alright, let me... let me fucking attack this wall real quick.

631
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:03,470
Boop!

632
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:04,830
Alright, let me do this.

633
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:08,330
Yeah, they don't want to get gun cooties.

634
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:10,890
That's how you get cooties.

635
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:15,750
Sweet!

636
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:16,590
Thank you for the super chat!

637
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:16,870
Thank you!

638
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:19,110
I work too hard, but being here is more important.

639
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:19,690
Who needs...

640
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:19,730
No!

641
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:20,430
You sleep!

642
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:21,710
Sweet!

643
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:22,490
Don't worry!

644
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:23,650
There's always the fun!

645
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:25,370
Sleep is very important.

646
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:27,430
Sleep is so important.

647
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:29,150
I still haven't fixed my sleep schedule.

648
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:31,730
It's been like...

649
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:34,830
Two weeks and I still haven't fixed it.

650
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:36,910
Guys, remember to backseat me for the riddles.

651
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:38,450
I'm too stupid to solve this right now.

652
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:41,370
This is why Bat... You know what I noticed?

653
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:45,150
I noticed that all of Batman's robins have like black hair.

654
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:47,910
So like... it's not random.

655
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,770
I've noticed it.

656
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:57,430
The kids he's adopting.

657
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,430
It's not random.

658
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:02,990
He's got a type.

659
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:11,780
Whoa!

660
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:12,820
He's got a type.

661
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,120
Yeah.

662
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,840
There was the red hair.

663
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,640
Yeah, but like...

664
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,880
We don't really think about that person.

665
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,280
He had it in pre-crisis.

666
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:27,940
Yes!

667
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,780
But then he dyed his hair.

668
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,240
Hmm...

669
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,700
Because he realized he wasn't...

670
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,400
He wasn't the favorite.

671
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:41,180
He realized he wasn't...

672
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,520
I'm having a conversation!

673
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,400
I'm so sorry!

674
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:44,480
Whoa!

675
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:48,120
Where the fuck did I get shot at?

676
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:51,780
As I was saying, he realized...

677
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,460
He realized that...

678
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:58,640
You know, he wasn't getting the same treatment as the other robins.

679
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,400
I mean, he was literally the first one to die.

680
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,280
So like...

681
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,380
At this point, like...

682
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,200
Wow!

683
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:08,240
The robin that doesn't have black hair...

684
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:08,940
Dies?

685
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:10,600
That's...

686
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,120
What a coincidence!

687
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,860
Yeah, it was so rude.

688
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,540
Where am I supposed to go?

689
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,780
I need to...

690
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,680
I already lost the trail.

691
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,000
I was in lot looking at the trail.

692
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,600
Where is it?

693
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,640
Ah, shit!

694
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,200
Where is the DNA?

695
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,900
Oh, there it is.

696
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,640
Oh, there it is.

697
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,500
There is where it goes.

698
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,240
I'm so happy it doesn't have flashbang anymore.

699
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,440
I hated that shit so much.

700
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,460
Uh...

701
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,440
This way?

702
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,520
Okay, there it is.

703
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,200
Oh, has...

704
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:47,440
Oh!

705
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,060
Structural weakness.

706
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:49,680
Okay.

707
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,830
Does it really matter if I...

708
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:52,740
Oh, wait!

709
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:53,180
I can...

710
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,000
I can collapse this structure.

711
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:03,190
Alright.

712
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:03,950
Boop!

713
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,630
How do you not hear that?

714
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:07,790
Oh, that doesn't matter.

715
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:08,870
It was just lore.

716
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:11,290
I returned to my work.

717
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:15,090
But I could not shake the pictures from my mind.

718
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:17,590
I should have been repulsed.

719
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:24,870
But I was more eager than ever to find an explanation for why someone would do this.

720
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:28,630
Oh, okay.

721
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:30,190
You hear that?

722
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:31,430
Uhhh...

723
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,870
You know they don't have guns.

724
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:33,770
I can just beat them up.

725
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:35,850
I don't know if they have joker insur...

726
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:39,050
I actually wonder if the joker actually provides insurance.

727
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:41,690
Do you guys think the joker would provide insurance?

728
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:48,650
Cause like I feel like being a henchman is like...

729
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:50,330
Like such a...

730
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:53,930
Like it's like literally the only job I feel like.

731
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:55,010
No?

732
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:58,150
He could be a good employer.

733
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,350
You don't know that.

734
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:01,690
Not a chance.

735
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:04,450
He could be a good employer.

736
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:08,450
Okay, let me...

737
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:09,710
Oh shit!

738
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:09,950
No!

739
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:11,850
Okay, counter him.

740
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:14,230
Gotta get this guy up.

741
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:15,550
Get out.

742
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:16,130
Get out!

743
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,190
Get out!

744
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:18,770
Okay, get him out first.

745
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:22,330
Like he pays his taxes.

746
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,390
Okay, if he pays his taxes.

747
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:26,670
He could pay...

748
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:27,810
He could be paying insurance.

749
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:31,430
But to be fair, he does employ a lot of henchmen.

750
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:33,690
So that is a lot of insurance.

751
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:36,710
Does he offer 401K?

752
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:37,290
Oh yeah!

753
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:38,250
Wait, you're alive?

754
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:41,050
Oh there...

755
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:42,750
Oh okay, he's just gonna...

756
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:43,450
Jog off.

757
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:43,790
Okay.

758
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:47,210
Bro, I don't think that guy's alive though.

759
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:49,070
I don't think he's alive.

760
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:51,490
Alright, which one do we upgrade guys?

761
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:53,090
Combo boost.

762
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:54,430
Combo Batarang.

763
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:55,610
HP.

764
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:56,890
Batarang power.

765
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:58,450
Twin Batarangs.

766
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:00,530
Sonic Batarangs.

767
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:02,430
Uh...

768
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:05,430
Okay, these are not available for upgrade.

769
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:06,270
I don't think.

770
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:07,590
Oh wait, they are.

771
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:08,790
Nice.

772
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:09,910
Take down!

773
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:12,870
Batarang combo boost.

774
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:14,030
Okay, combo boost.

775
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:15,650
Joker pays spikes.

776
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:16,850
Oh shit.

777
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,410
Neil, thank you for the super chat.

778
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:18,770
Thank you.

779
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:21,930
Wait, I'll get the combo boost.

780
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:26,770
Are you okay?

781
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:27,170
Thank you Batman.

782
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:29,270
The guard wouldn't have lasted much longer.

783
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:30,330
Is he okay?

784
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:32,550
He struck his head when they knocked him out.

785
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:33,670
Oh no.

786
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:35,350
I'll move him away from here as soon as you can.

787
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:37,170
Take him to the medical facility.

788
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:39,090
It's the safest place on the island.

789
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:39,670
Okay.

790
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:40,910
I'll go with you soon as I understand.

791
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:46,930
I feel like a henchman has to be like the most lucrative job there is in Gotham City.

792
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:49,450
Like there's so many henchmen.

793
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:52,150
Like there's so many mob bosses too.

794
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:53,770
It's like...

795
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:58,390
It's like the only job in Gotham City.

796
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,730
Think about it.

797
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:01,790
I just noticed.

798
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,690
It's literally like the only job.

799
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:06,590
Like this entire town is controlled by the mob.

800
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:08,330
And it's just like...

801
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:10,110
Like the police is useless.

802
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:14,350
Why be a cop when you can just be a fucking like underling?

803
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:21,190
There's no reason to be...

804
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:24,670
Why be paid like minimal wage as a cop when you can be...

805
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:29,750
Why be paid like $11 for an hour for a cop when you can be paid like...

806
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:30,610
I don't know.

807
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:35,310
Like $100 per hour because you're always going on heists and everything.

808
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:36,430
Boop.

809
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:38,910
Nice.

810
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:40,690
I did that.

811
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:41,990
No, don't grab the gun.

812
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:43,410
No, I can't run.

813
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:46,110
No, don't pick up the gun!

814
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,010
No!

815
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:48,650
Oh, he's not picking up the gun.

816
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:52,130
He knows that he respects the five second rule.

817
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:53,690
Oh, I just punted him.

818
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:55,630
That's nice.

819
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:56,550
See, I told you.

820
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:58,210
I told you.

821
00:34:58,270 --> 00:34:59,430
Oh, no, no, no, no.

822
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:00,530
That's more than five seconds.

823
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:00,810
Five seconds!

824
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,270
All right.

825
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:06,530
Let's get him out.

826
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:08,290
I need to make sure he doesn't come back.

827
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:11,550
Oh, yeah.

828
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:12,510
You think about it.

829
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:15,850
Batman is sort of like a furry because he's wearing a...

830
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:18,770
He's wearing an outfit inspired by a bat.

831
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,480
Why is the Junkling obsessed with man and bat?

832
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,760
Is he a furry?

833
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,120
Thank you.

834
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,040
Thank you.

835
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,060
Thank you.

836
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:33,600
Thank you.

837
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,080
Oh, shit.

838
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,180
My chat died.

839
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,120
Give me a sec.

840
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,380
I need to reload my chat.

841
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,580
He has bat ears.

842
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,160
Yeah.

843
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,840
And he likes Catwoman!

844
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,360
Catwoman is definitely a furry.

845
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,840
If you think about it.

846
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,140
$9 billion fursuit.

847
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,020
No, but you don't understand.

848
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,200
Like, fursuits actually are like a fucking... so expensive.

849
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,260
And he's a billionaire, too!

850
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:03,580
Oh, my God.

851
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,080
Oh, what?

852
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:05,620
It fits him.

853
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:06,520
It fits him.

854
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:07,900
All right.

855
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,480
Where am I going?

856
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,080
Oh, okay.

857
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:11,660
That's locked.

858
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,140
Okay.

859
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,080
Wait, what's the riddle?

860
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,840
I don't remember what the riddle was in this area.

861
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,080
Guys, where is the riddle?

862
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,740
Where is the riddle?

863
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,060
I don't know what the riddle was.

864
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,640
I don't remember the riddle.

865
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,740
There's a tape?

866
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,640
Where's the tape?

867
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:39,920
Tape?

868
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:46,810
Tape?

869
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:48,970
There's no tape here.

870
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,270
You fucking liars.

871
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:54,110
Where the fuck is the tape?

872
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,810
Oh, it's near the entrance?

873
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:58,170
Okay, don't worry.

874
00:36:58,270 --> 00:36:59,150
I won't miss the lore.

875
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:04,530
Oh yeah, do you know there's lore on why he wears his underwear outside of his suit?

876
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:05,630
I know.

877
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:08,610
They have lore for everything.

878
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:11,410
Who's this?

879
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,660
Okay, but like 20 is like nothing in Gotham at this rate.

880
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:59,260
Where the fuck is this guy?

881
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,840
This is actually a villain I don't know.

882
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:16,880
He's important enough to have like a voice file, but I'm like, where the fuck is this guy?

883
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:22,980
Anyway, so the reason why Batman wears his underwear outside of his like...

884
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,860
superhero suit is that it acts as like a...

885
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,720
a filtration device.

886
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,420
So like, I don't remember if it was like gas or whatever.

887
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:38,220
But like, he can use it to- he can take- so he can take his underwear off very fast.

888
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:41,060
And use it as like a filtration thing.

889
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,700
Yeah, yeah!

890
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:52,720
Like to like- to like, you know, put it- put it over his mouth to filter stuff.

891
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:56,560
And I- I don't- it's obviously bullshit that they invented.

892
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:04,900
Later on, but like that's like the current lore as to why- as to why he wears underwear outside of his suit.

893
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:11,600
It's obvious, it's like they invented it just for like- as like a bullshit reason.

894
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:16,320
But that's like the canon reason why he fucking wears his underwear.

895
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,440
It's like a gas mask.

896
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:24,240
Yeah, it's like apparently a fucking- like it's apparently a gas mask.

897
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:24,740
...

898
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,480
Alright, is there anybody here?

899
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,100
I wanna be sure if there's anybody here.

900
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:32,640
Okay.

901
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,820
Is there anything in here?

902
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,220
What's the sauce for this?

903
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,180
YouTube shorts.

904
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,280
It's always YouTube shorts.

905
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,540
I thought...

906
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,200
Real soft!

907
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:48,040
How do you reflect on your successes and failures, Batman?

908
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,920
I don't if I don't think about it.

909
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:54,680
If I never think about it, then I'll never feel guilty.

910
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,700
Yeah, next time I'll be stuck in deadly gas, I'll use my underwear.

911
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,120
Exactly!

912
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:01,600
We're all learning!

913
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,640
Hello.

914
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:10,260
Ooh, I don't like two people, one voice, no gun.

915
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,020
Two-face?

916
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:12,580
Ow!

917
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,320
Wait, what's going on over there?

918
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,760
Is this the laughing gas?

919
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,200
What's going on?

920
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,000
What the fuck is going on?

921
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,860
What the fuck?

922
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,700
Is everything okay?

923
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:34,060
Is... what the fuck is... what?

924
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,760
What is going on?

925
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:41,260
Well, this doesn't look too good.

926
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,400
Are they okay?

927
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,480
Wait, how did you die?

928
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,900
They're all locked up.

929
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:52,120
Return to monkey.

930
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,860
Holy shit, what's going on?

931
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,260
Okay, there's the electricity.

932
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,680
I wonder if there's like anything extra up top.

933
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:03,960
Is there anything... any loot?

934
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:07,860
I know there's like a party going downstairs, but... loot?

935
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:12,000
Supplies can only be used only in a breakout attempt.

936
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,460
This is important!

937
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,100
This is the breakout attempt!

938
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,440
There might be stuff here.

939
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,100
Teeth!

940
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,360
Teeth!

941
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:21,920
Teeth!

942
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:22,720
Teeth!

943
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,240
Alright.

944
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:25,640
Nope.

945
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,420
Can't activate that yet.

946
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:28,500
Oh!

947
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,220
Taped patient evaluation five.

948
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:39,140
Victor, yesterday we spoke about the people you killed.

949
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,940
Ah, the zombies.

950
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,720
They are all people, Victor.

951
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:52,380
Continuously shuttling through the daily grind, waiting for someone to... liberate them.

952
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:53,700
You mean kill them.

953
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,060
The police report states that you've murdered... or...

954
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:59,660
Oh, it's twenty... twenty people in this room.

955
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:00,220
Three months?

956
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,880
That's like... nothing.

957
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,360
In Gotham.

958
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,980
The Joker murders like fifty people a day!

959
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,080
He should be like in the like... the prison.

960
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:17,740
Like...

961
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:19,740
He should not be in Arkham Asylum.

962
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,700
Arkham Asylum is where like... the grade A villains...

963
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,180
Like rookie numbers, exactly.

964
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,060
It's okay.

965
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,120
It's fine.

966
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,400
It's like it.

967
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,280
I

968
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,740
can make it happen.

969
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,700
Yeah, he has such a fucking low body count.

970
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:48,590
He is not... he is not fit.

971
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:50,590
He's not Arkham Asylum material.

972
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:53,070
This is why nobody remembers him.

973
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:55,550
Twenty people in like three months?

974
00:42:55,950 --> 00:43:02,670
Like, if I was allowed to kill... I'm pretty sure I've killed like a hundred today.

975
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:05,470
It's still...

976
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:06,550
The thing is...

977
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:07,290
Like...

978
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:12,150
It might have... it might have been like one week since we played... we started playing this game.

979
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:19,110
But all... like... all right now... like for Batman... it's still like maybe two hours have passed for Batman.

980
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:25,050
And like... if we're going by Batman time... if I was allowed to kill in Batman...

981
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:28,110
I'm pretty sure I've killed a hundred people in Batman.

982
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:31,590
Within two hours in Arkham Asylum.

983
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,560
I'm... I'm just saying.

984
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:49,940
That's why this is like... who the fuck cares about Mr. Zazz?

985
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:56,360
Why the fuck do we put him in like the grade A... the grade A... um... asylum?

986
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,280
Oh wait, is this it?

987
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:00,800
Oh, now this is too small.

988
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:01,800
There you go.

989
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,380
Two people, one voice, one... there has to be two...

990
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:06,880
Oh, that's a ventricle request?

991
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:11,560
Arnold Wesker was a timid orphan whose deep regression...

992
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:11,740
Arnold Wesker was a timid orphan whose deep regression...

993
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:13,360
erupted in a barren brawl.

994
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,840
Resulting in him being sent to Blackgate Prison.

995
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:18,660
There he encountered a puppet Scarface and...

996
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:20,560
Oh yeah, he's like a mob boss son or something.

997
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:23,200
And probably murdered a man who carved the puppet.

998
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:27,700
The two are now inseparable with a Scarface directing a series of criminal activities.

999
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:33,040
While most believe that Wesker is simply acting out a second personality through the puppet.

1000
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:37,540
Wesker sees himself as a reluctant lackey who merely does his parents' bitty.

1001
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:38,920
What's his... what's his size?

1002
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:40,240
What's his height?

1003
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:42,700
5'7".

1004
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,480
Professional criminal.

1005
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,040
Nice.

1006
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:47,020
Oh wait, he has facts!

1007
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:48,800
Wait, I wanna know about his life!

1008
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:49,820
Alright.

1009
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:51,400
Delusional, schizophrenic...

1010
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,480
Oh, he didn't take his meds.

1011
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,280
Obsessed with his puppet Scarface whom he puppeteers with...

1012
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,200
This...

1013
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:58,400
Wait...

1014
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,700
Do we just have a mental health problem in Gotham City?

1015
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,720
When teen was...

1016
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,640
If we give the criminals, like, actually meds...

1017
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,660
Do you think they'll be better?

1018
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:08,600
Like...

1019
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:09,580
I don't know.

1020
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:11,500
Batman!

1021
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:17,640
You could have stopped all this if you improved the mental health system!

1022
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:23,880
In Gotham City instead of running around in your underwear and buying underwear gas masks!

1023
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,400
Alright, I guess we leave here.

1024
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:30,300
Probably not.

1025
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,500
Who needs YouTube shorts for Batman lore?

1026
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:37,880
I use Doki Batman shoes for getting the lore.

1027
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,700
Go Zeta, thank you for the super chat!

1028
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:40,640
Thank you, thank you!

1029
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,560
He is Gotham's biggest serial killer after Joker.

1030
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:48,820
Yeah, yeah, he is definitely Gotham's biggest serial killer after Joker.

1031
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:50,480
Thank you for the super chat, Zeta.

1032
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,280
Thank you, thank you.

1033
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,140
Oh, is that Poison Ivy?

1034
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,040
Poison Ivy!

1035
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:55,140
Stop!

1036
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:56,200
Really

1037
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:03,810
not interested in a bunch of flowers, Ivy.

1038
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:05,910
They're in pain!

1039
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:07,350
Cry for help!

1040
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:08,510
Ooh!

1041
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:10,470
Where are your babies?

1042
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:11,530
Just stay where you are.

1043
00:46:11,530 --> 00:46:15,430
Last thing I need is you running out of- Just stay- how is she gonna get out?

1044
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:18,210
I'll save you.

1045
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:20,950
Just stay where you are.

1046
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:23,630
Like, she's- where is she gonna go?

1047
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:34,090
Botanist Pamela Isley was transformed by a science experiment gone wrong into a plant-human hybrid.

1048
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:41,430
With chlorophyll flowing through her veins instead of blood, she developed a toxic touch and a pheromone-fueled talent for seduction.

1049
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:50,930
Her crimes have become more ecologically focused as she has increasingly abandoned her human side, identifying more with the natural world.

1050
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:59,310
Her unique brand of ecoterrorism often puts her in a conflict with Batman, whose iron will usually protects him from her seductive powers.

1051
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:01,650
She's not hot enough, I guess.

1052
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:03,110
It's just not his type.

1053
00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:07,870
Five foot- wait, she's taller than the ventriloquist.

1054
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:09,350
...

1055
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:18,710
An ability to encourage and direct the growth of all plant life, plant genes mixed into her DNA makes her an unpredictable and formidable physical opponent.

1056
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:22,850
Exudes natural pheromones that enable her to exert control over victims.

1057
00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:23,530
Okay.

1058
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:27,130
Are you crying?

1059
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:31,770
Wait, why is she wearing a shirt?

1060
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:38,410
I mean- I meant that in a way where like, her clothes are her plants.

1061
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:39,490
You know?

1062
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:44,090
I didn't mean that in any other way.

1063
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:48,790
Because look, look, she's not wearing a pink-red shirt here.

1064
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:58,110
I'm saying it because she's wearing a red shirt.

1065
00:47:58,530 --> 00:48:01,530
But like, she's not wearing a shirt here.

1066
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:02,850
Like, her clothes are plants.

1067
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:04,570
And that's not a plant.

1068
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:07,310
It's not like in any- it's not a perfect way!

1069
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:09,030
I'm not saying it in a perverted way!

1070
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:11,270
I'm saying it as a lore way.

1071
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:15,990
That's not a part of her!

1072
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:16,470
It's red!

1073
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:18,870
That's not a natural plant!

1074
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:21,330
I'm just saying!

1075
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:24,230
It's not- it doesn't fit lore!

1076
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:28,070
According to the lore!

1077
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:30,710
Her shirt should be green!

1078
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:34,810
Alan, you said what everyone wanted.

1079
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:36,370
Shake my head.

1080
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:40,890
They're all like little monkeys!

1081
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:44,050
Who's they?

1082
00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:46,490
Okay.

1083
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:55,890
A case of mistaken identity.

1084
00:48:57,590 --> 00:48:58,150
What?

1085
00:48:58,290 --> 00:48:58,770
Who?

1086
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:03,180
Who's that?

1087
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:04,220
Is that Garrd?

1088
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:04,820
Wait, what?

1089
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:05,400
Is Quincy?

1090
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:08,100
Oh, Aaron?

1091
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,260
You need to get me out of this cell.

1092
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:12,720
It's me Cash!

1093
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:20,720
You've been like useless so far though.

1094
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:22,420
Why would I need your help?

1095
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,100
Harley?

1096
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,540
Why is she wearing a shirt?

1097
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:06,000
No!

1098
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:06,700
Ivy!

1099
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:08,480
I told you to stay in there!

1100
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:10,760
Ivy, what the fuck?

1101
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:13,240
I'm a good kid.

1102
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:16,620
Whoa!

1103
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:17,380
Whoa!

1104
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,420
They're just really good friends, yeah.

1105
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:30,240
Guys, they're just best friends.

1106
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:33,860
Ow!

1107
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:35,140
No!

1108
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,460
I wanted to scare him!

1109
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,420
Yeah, they're roommates.

1110
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:41,760
No!

1111
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,780
I wanted to scare him for Clayface!

1112
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,760
Just gals being pals.

1113
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,940
Alright, I guess we'll rescue you.

1114
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:17,880
It's like the Sailor Moon English dub, where they're like, they're just cousins.

1115
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,540
Wow, they're such good cousins to each other.

1116
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:31,220
Broke and used my 512 bit decryption key.

1117
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,480
Use ultrasound to bypass security systems.

1118
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:34,680
Oh my god, I can finally do this!

1119
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:36,480
There's always a way out.

1120
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:37,700
Always.

1121
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:40,200
My fists will make the way out.

1122
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:41,460
Which one is it?

1123
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:41,960
This one.

1124
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:42,860
Okay.

1125
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:44,700
Here?

1126
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:46,040
Boop.

1127
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,540
I'll just shoot the problem.

1128
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:49,400
Oh, never mind.

1129
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:51,580
What?

1130
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:54,760
What?

1131
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,200
What am I doing?

1132
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:03,120
What the fuck am I doing?

1133
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,140
Is that hacking?

1134
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:09,960
Is this...

1135
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,100
Oh, I make it green!

1136
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:15,580
Wait, oh, he changed.

1137
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:18,840
Clayface.

1138
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:20,520
I'm losing patience.

1139
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,120
You're cheating.

1140
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:23,940
Alright.

1141
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:33,720
Initially an actor in horror films, Kylo went mad when he learned a classic film of his was to be remade with a different actor in the lead role.

1142
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:39,940
He took on the mask of the film's villain, Clayface, and killed several of the remake's cast and crew before being slaughtered.

1143
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:41,740
He was stopped by Batman and Robin.

1144
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:48,840
Later, Kylo joined a mud pack, an alliance of shape-changing, mutated villains who had subsequently used the name Clayface.

1145
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:53,820
While the group was defeated, Kylo tricked his allies and injected himself with the essences of several of them.

1146
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:59,300
Becoming a superhuman imbued with the ability to change shape, he just wants to be an actor.

1147
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:03,480
That's all.

1148
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:06,260
He doesn't want... oh, he must be like really old too.

1149
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:09,460
Because he was... he got casted.

1150
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:14,480
Oh yeah, any fun facts?

1151
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:15,660
Six push five.

1152
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:17,700
Professional criminal.

1153
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,960
He can alter his physical form, adopt the appearance of nearly anyone.

1154
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,360
His mouthful, his touch can be poisonous.

1155
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:34,410
Wait, what is he doing with that doll?

1156
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:36,790
Clayface?

1157
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:42,590
Clayface, where are you?

1158
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:44,410
What are you doing?

1159
00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:45,710
What are you doing with this little doll?

1160
00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:47,970
I'm just curious, Clayface.

1161
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:49,430
Like...

1162
00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:55,310
Whoa!

1163
00:53:56,470 --> 00:53:57,230
Again!

1164
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:09,230
Is that it?

1165
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:11,270
I don't think he knows Commissioner Gordon.

1166
00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:12,270
I...

1167
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:19,070
I don't think he knows like...

1168
00:54:19,070 --> 00:54:21,930
I don't think he's like met Commissioner Gordon.

1169
00:54:22,070 --> 00:54:26,010
He definitely hasn't really studied this role yet.

1170
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:28,850
Again!

1171
00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:30,330
Again!

1172
00:54:31,130 --> 00:54:31,950
Again!

1173
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:37,510
Aww, no more magic tricks.

1174
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:39,150
No more.

1175
00:54:40,090 --> 00:54:42,490
The commissioner who laughs.

1176
00:54:42,770 --> 00:54:44,870
He probably only saw him on TV.

1177
00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:46,530
Yeah, he probably has.

1178
00:54:46,930 --> 00:54:49,170
He doesn't know like what he actually does.

1179
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:50,110
Oh, riddle me this.

1180
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:53,430
Nice.

1181
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:58,600
Riddle me this.

1182
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:02,700
Fake fan.

1183
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,760
Wait, if I talk to him, will he...

1184
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:07,540
Will he change back?

1185
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:09,640
No.

1186
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:11,840
Aww, look there's another wheelchair!

1187
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:16,720
Like I'm pretty sure there's not a lot of people who are...

1188
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:17,800
Who are like...

1189
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:19,900
Who need that wheelchair.

1190
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:24,040
I think it's just Joker trying to convince someone to do stuff.

1191
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:26,280
He break...

1192
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:27,380
I don't want to break the glass.

1193
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:28,120
Why the...

1194
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:29,300
What the fuck?

1195
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:31,740
Who's your arm?

1196
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,160
Who's your arm?

1197
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:35,740
Who's your arm?

1198
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,280
Is it inside?

1199
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:42,140
Who are you?

1200
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:43,300
Oh, riddle me this.

1201
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:45,560
Can I...

1202
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,120
Can I hack this?

1203
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,960
Oh, can I hack this?

1204
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:52,420
I can!

1205
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:57,960
It's hacking time.

1206
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:00,240
Yay!

1207
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:07,500
Are you okay, sir?

1208
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:08,500
I'm okay.

1209
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:09,220
I'm okay.

1210
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:12,460
Intensive treatment extreme.

1211
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:15,740
Han, thank you for the super chat.

1212
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:16,520
Thank you, thank you.

1213
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:19,220
In the morning, I have a competition later, but watching a stream is more...

1214
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:19,460
No!

1215
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:21,220
You have to win for me!

1216
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:22,360
Han, thank you for the super chat.

1217
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:23,120
Thank you, thank you.

1218
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:25,040
You have to win for me!

1219
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:25,720
Go to sleep!

1220
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,340
Oh no, Poison Ivy's out.

1221
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:31,080
Alright.

1222
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,320
Where are the enemies?

1223
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:35,240
Enemy?

1224
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:37,320
Wait, riddle me this.

1225
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,620
Okay, this is more important.

1226
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:41,100
Yay!

1227
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:42,860
XP.

1228
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:44,400
What do I have to do?

1229
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:48,640
Destroy the Titan production facility and botanical gardens.

1230
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:50,260
Okay, I need to get to the botanical...

1231
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:51,700
What the fuck is the botanical?

1232
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:52,660
Okay, I have to go outside.

1233
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,500
I have to go touch grass now.

1234
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:56,760
Jesus Christ, get over here.

1235
00:56:59,380 --> 00:56:59,860
Alright,

1236
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:05,360
let's see.

1237
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:06,420
Ooh!

1238
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:07,800
Okay.

1239
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:10,480
I need to mark this.

1240
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:13,020
One punch.

1241
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:17,080
Like, I wish he did not have a single plan for this.

1242
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,100
He did not have a fucking plan.

1243
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:22,780
How do I do this?

1244
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,480
Or just hack this?

1245
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:27,920
Wait, can I hack this?

1246
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:29,940
No.

1247
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:30,840
Fuck.

1248
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,060
Wait, how the fuck do I get over there?

1249
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,200
It's so far!

1250
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,740
What if I just...

1251
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:39,740
Oh, later?

1252
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:40,900
Okay, not yet.

1253
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:41,280
Okay.

1254
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:45,360
When you say later, it means I'm never coming back here.

1255
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:50,220
You know damn well I'm never coming back.

1256
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:53,440
I always thought there was a spark between us.

1257
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,060
Bro, how...

1258
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:57,500
From how many people?

1259
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:02,680
From now, there is.

1260
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:04,780
Oh, no!

1261
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:09,550
Hey, that just meant...

1262
00:58:09,550 --> 00:58:11,350
Come and get me, Bats!

1263
00:58:11,390 --> 00:58:13,310
I double dare ya!

1264
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:16,610
Oh, shit.

1265
00:58:17,430 --> 00:58:18,390
Oh, shit.

1266
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:19,230
Where am I?

1267
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:19,990
Oh, fuck!

1268
00:58:21,570 --> 00:58:22,630
Can't go back!

1269
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:24,850
Oh, wait, I can go up.

1270
00:58:25,190 --> 00:58:26,630
You guys are idiots!

1271
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:28,270
They're got to everywhere!

1272
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:30,050
Nice.

1273
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:32,710
You're dead!

1274
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:33,450
God damn it!

1275
00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:34,130
Can you hear me, man?

1276
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:40,570
Get up here.

1277
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:43,810
It's not fair!

1278
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:46,790
Oh, shit!

1279
00:58:46,930 --> 00:58:48,170
Oh, shit, he's grabbing a gun!

1280
00:58:48,930 --> 00:58:49,990
Somebody stop him!

1281
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:51,110
I'll stop him!

1282
00:58:51,850 --> 00:58:52,510
There you go.

1283
00:58:55,010 --> 00:58:55,450
Nice.

1284
00:58:59,150 --> 00:59:01,230
Yeah, just run away.

1285
00:59:02,130 --> 00:59:02,950
All right, here's you.

1286
00:59:03,730 --> 00:59:04,730
Wait, there's more?

1287
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:06,090
Sorry.

1288
00:59:06,190 --> 00:59:07,850
If you all stay near me, it's like bowling again.

1289
00:59:08,690 --> 00:59:10,090
Just punch around on me!

1290
00:59:10,110 --> 00:59:10,550
If you don't, I'll shoot you.

1291
00:59:10,570 --> 00:59:11,070
Eventually!

1292
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:13,830
Eventually it'll all hit you.

1293
00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:19,910
I love buddy mashing.

1294
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:21,990
It's my favorite part about fighting games.

1295
00:59:23,770 --> 00:59:24,990
Am I doing it?

1296
00:59:25,050 --> 00:59:25,590
Am I doing it?

1297
00:59:25,650 --> 00:59:26,590
Am I pressing Y and B?

1298
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:27,690
Nice.

1299
00:59:32,050 --> 00:59:32,830
Last guy.

1300
00:59:35,310 --> 00:59:35,830
Goodbye!

1301
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:38,910
I'm doing it.

1302
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:44,780
Was that as easy as it looked?

1303
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:45,480
Huh.

1304
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:49,320
Well, it won't be so easy trying to catch me.

1305
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:49,800
Mwah!

1306
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:55,210
I mean...

1307
00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:59,910
If I actually shoot you, it'd be easier.

1308
01:00:00,290 --> 01:00:02,650
I feel like why wouldn't I have tranquilizer guns?

1309
01:00:03,870 --> 01:00:08,370
Like, what are my Batman gear that's just not just fist and bat around?

1310
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:13,730
I feel like it'd be easier to have a tranquilizer and I can just tranquilize villains.

1311
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:15,270
Because I can't kill.

1312
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:18,930
But... I can like... put them to sleep.

1313
01:00:21,190 --> 01:00:23,670
If I put them in a coma, does that count as killing?

1314
01:00:26,410 --> 01:00:27,890
Thank you for the super chat!

1315
01:00:27,970 --> 01:00:28,290
Thank you!

1316
01:00:28,290 --> 01:00:28,810
Thank you!

1317
01:00:28,830 --> 01:00:29,610
It's 11pm.

1318
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:33,090
I have nothing planned tomorrow, but Doki's stream is more important.

1319
01:00:33,370 --> 01:00:34,530
Thanks for the EU friendly time!

1320
01:00:34,550 --> 01:00:35,170
It's up to you!

1321
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:36,590
And once again, thank you for the super chat!

1322
01:00:36,690 --> 01:00:36,930
Thank you!

1323
01:00:36,950 --> 01:00:37,630
Thank you!

1324
01:00:37,970 --> 01:00:38,870
It's no problem.

1325
01:00:39,090 --> 01:00:45,070
I only do a longer stream today for Batman because I realize I am very behind in Batman.

1326
01:00:48,610 --> 01:00:52,370
If I put them in a vegetable state, is that also killing?

1327
01:00:52,630 --> 01:00:54,610
This rule sucks, Batman!

1328
01:00:58,370 --> 01:01:00,550
This rule fucking sucks!

1329
01:01:01,590 --> 01:01:06,850
Because like, putting them in a vegetable state is almost practically the same thing.

1330
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:12,070
Oh, wait, let me hack this.

1331
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:13,270
Yes!

1332
01:01:14,390 --> 01:01:14,990
Yes!

1333
01:01:15,190 --> 01:01:15,790
Yes!

1334
01:01:15,790 --> 01:01:15,910
Yes!

1335
01:01:15,910 --> 01:01:18,190
But technically I'm sort of doing it already.

1336
01:01:18,610 --> 01:01:20,170
I can't even think about it.

1337
01:01:25,970 --> 01:01:27,330
There we go.

1338
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:28,850
This is...

1339
01:01:31,650 --> 01:01:37,170
If I was... If I made this, then it wouldn't be hacking because I made it.

1340
01:01:40,170 --> 01:01:42,470
Okay, I'm a little lost right now.

1341
01:01:42,970 --> 01:01:44,690
It's arguably worse.

1342
01:01:44,690 --> 01:01:50,590
Like I'm practically... Oh yeah, me punching those henchmen in the head is not technically putting them in the vegetable state.

1343
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:51,730
Like...

1344
01:01:57,450 --> 01:02:00,370
Okay, I'll make sure like everything I got...

1345
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:05,040
It's locked.

1346
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:05,940
What?

1347
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:06,940
I thought I hacked everything.

1348
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:08,560
Let's do the hack.

1349
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:13,640
Oh, were those upper level?

1350
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:14,980
I already got that.

1351
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:15,740
That's the gun.

1352
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:19,600
You're just...

1353
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:21,740
Putting them in dream realm.

1354
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:23,160
Oh, there it is.

1355
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:23,900
I didn't hack this.

1356
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:25,940
Wait, what?

1357
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,380
No, I hacked that.

1358
01:02:30,990 --> 01:02:33,710
I'm just gonna beat this guy up real fast.

1359
01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:34,710
Monkey.

1360
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:36,870
Get over here.

1361
01:02:39,410 --> 01:02:41,150
Let me kill this guy first.

1362
01:02:41,410 --> 01:02:42,390
Get over here.

1363
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:45,810
Nice riddle.

1364
01:02:46,790 --> 01:02:49,050
You're standing in the way with my riddle.

1365
01:02:52,490 --> 01:02:53,430
Alright, here you go.

1366
01:02:54,210 --> 01:02:55,770
No punch monkey.

1367
01:02:56,910 --> 01:02:58,010
Didn't I hack everything?

1368
01:02:58,410 --> 01:02:59,350
What else do I have to hack?

1369
01:03:01,730 --> 01:03:03,010
I thought I hacked everything.

1370
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:09,000
I'm just tucking... Yeah, I'm just tucking them into bed.

1371
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:10,560
Yeah, I hacked this.

1372
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:14,260
Hacked that.

1373
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:15,800
Wait, there's something below me.

1374
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:18,300
Oh no, no, not that.

1375
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:19,760
Hacked the bodies.

1376
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:21,680
This is not PAL World, guys.

1377
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:24,220
Did I hack this?

1378
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:24,740
No.

1379
01:03:28,570 --> 01:03:30,550
Where the fuck do I need to go?

1380
01:03:32,110 --> 01:03:33,450
The door is locked.

1381
01:03:36,030 --> 01:03:37,150
I'm chasing Harley.

1382
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:38,610
Yeah, but the doors are locked.

1383
01:03:38,830 --> 01:03:39,650
I hacked everything.

1384
01:03:41,390 --> 01:03:42,070
I think?

1385
01:03:45,010 --> 01:03:47,070
I forgot where he ran... she ran to.

1386
01:03:52,450 --> 01:03:53,990
I blew up a wall?

1387
01:03:55,010 --> 01:03:56,260
I'm just like...

1388
01:03:56,550 --> 01:03:59,090
When did I do that?

1389
01:03:59,330 --> 01:04:00,770
I'm so confused.

1390
01:04:08,060 --> 01:04:10,180
Where I got the last trophy.

1391
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:14,140
I'm so lost.

1392
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:16,300
This is why I need a robin.

1393
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:17,300
Robins!

1394
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:18,420
Where are you?

1395
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:21,880
Go straight to the side.

1396
01:04:21,940 --> 01:04:22,780
This one?

1397
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:27,260
Where are my robins?

1398
01:04:27,260 --> 01:04:28,300
Oh wait, this way.

1399
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:30,860
That's me here.

1400
01:04:38,790 --> 01:04:42,550
Prometheus, Arkham God, most wanted and most hated.

1401
01:04:42,810 --> 01:04:47,010
Wait, there's someone more hated than fucking Batman and Joker?

1402
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:50,510
No way.

1403
01:04:51,010 --> 01:04:51,530
Really?

1404
01:04:51,630 --> 01:04:52,190
Let me do this.

1405
01:04:54,510 --> 01:04:55,770
Try using your...

1406
01:04:55,770 --> 01:04:56,050
No!

1407
01:04:58,570 --> 01:05:01,150
I don't need eyes when I have chat.

1408
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:15,420
Who's my favorite robin?

1409
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:20,120
What if I just let them die?

1410
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:32,670
I didn't kill him.

1411
01:05:32,710 --> 01:05:33,590
Gravity killed him.

1412
01:05:33,810 --> 01:05:34,110
Oh.

1413
01:05:34,450 --> 01:05:35,710
I have to save...

1414
01:05:35,710 --> 01:05:36,430
.

1415
01:05:41,130 --> 01:05:41,670
What?

1416
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:45,590
Why do I have to save them?

1417
01:05:46,830 --> 01:05:47,650
Oh yeah.

1418
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:50,390
Those two guards are the most important guards.

1419
01:05:50,770 --> 01:05:52,410
And I can just hire new ones.

1420
01:05:52,430 --> 01:05:52,710
That's cool.

1421
01:05:53,930 --> 01:05:56,270
Like, there's so many guards have died already.

1422
01:05:56,610 --> 01:05:58,110
Like, at this point, it's just...

1423
01:05:58,110 --> 01:05:59,330
I don't really care anymore.

1424
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:10,680
Okay.

1425
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:16,140
Okay, you do your exposition.

1426
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:17,060
I'm going to do this.

1427
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:22,760
It's not my fault.

1428
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:25,340
Wait, what?

1429
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,500
Wait, where's the other one?

1430
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:37,080
That's Batman.

1431
01:06:41,410 --> 01:06:42,230
Oh no.

1432
01:06:42,550 --> 01:06:43,230
Oh no!

1433
01:06:43,230 --> 01:06:44,430
No, I don't do all the pressure!

1434
01:06:48,050 --> 01:06:48,670
It's okay.

1435
01:06:49,970 --> 01:06:50,970
No, it's not okay!

1436
01:06:51,050 --> 01:06:51,310
No!

1437
01:06:53,910 --> 01:07:00,330
I thought I could... I thought I could do it... I thought I could just do it before it comes back up.

1438
01:07:03,130 --> 01:07:05,050
Okay, I'll let her do her exposition.

1439
01:07:13,110 --> 01:07:15,810
I didn't think she was gonna turn it on again so fast!

1440
01:07:17,530 --> 01:07:19,950
Alright, let her do her exposition this time.

1441
01:07:23,870 --> 01:07:25,270
Okay.

1442
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:34,250
Hacked.

1443
01:07:35,650 --> 01:07:37,050
No!

1444
01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:43,170
I don't like pressure!

1445
01:07:46,930 --> 01:07:47,630
Please.

1446
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:48,570
Please!

1447
01:07:49,350 --> 01:07:50,750
Please!

1448
01:07:55,890 --> 01:07:56,290
Please!

1449
01:07:56,850 --> 01:07:57,910
Don't turn it back on!

1450
01:07:57,990 --> 01:07:58,250
Please!

1451
01:07:58,390 --> 01:07:59,710
I'm stuck in the cutscene!

1452
01:08:03,550 --> 01:08:04,210
There you go.

1453
01:08:05,010 --> 01:08:05,410
Done.

1454
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:14,820
What?

1455
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:17,640
How?

1456
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:19,000
How?

1457
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:22,140
I don't do well on...

1458
01:08:30,170 --> 01:08:31,010
Hack the door?

1459
01:08:32,710 --> 01:08:33,450
Oh shit!

1460
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:33,950
Oh shit!

1461
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:34,430
Oh shit!

1462
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:34,830
Oh shit!

1463
01:08:35,350 --> 01:08:36,850
Alright, 11 seconds I can do this.

1464
01:08:37,490 --> 01:08:39,210
Why do you have to take so long to break?

1465
01:08:39,290 --> 01:08:40,670
I'm gonna go get fucking hacking things!

1466
01:08:41,070 --> 01:08:41,950
There you go.

1467
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:44,630
Get out!

1468
01:08:51,430 --> 01:08:52,150
Nice.

1469
01:08:55,390 --> 01:08:56,870
I'm so good at this game.

1470
01:08:59,030 --> 01:09:00,750
Not even close.

1471
01:09:03,570 --> 01:09:05,010
And then her girlfriend.

1472
01:09:05,370 --> 01:09:06,850
And then the other boyfriend.

1473
01:09:06,850 --> 01:09:08,850
And then the other boyfriend.

1474
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:09,990
And then...

1475
01:09:12,310 --> 01:09:14,250
Can I go back inside now?

1476
01:09:17,970 --> 01:09:19,130
Can I go back inside?

1477
01:09:22,490 --> 01:09:23,810
Oh wait, that's not the inside.

1478
01:09:23,990 --> 01:09:24,630
It was this way.

1479
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:29,510
Is it locked forever?

1480
01:09:29,770 --> 01:09:29,990
No!

1481
01:09:30,150 --> 01:09:31,310
It's locked forever!

1482
01:09:33,610 --> 01:09:34,630
Wait, where do I go?

1483
01:09:34,630 --> 01:09:34,770
Where do I go?

1484
01:09:36,890 --> 01:09:37,850
It's really...

1485
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:38,990
Where do I go?

1486
01:09:40,650 --> 01:09:41,590
Just like...

1487
01:09:42,130 --> 01:09:42,510
Where?

1488
01:09:43,710 --> 01:09:44,190
Here?

1489
01:09:44,710 --> 01:09:45,650
Oh, there's a hack.

1490
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:47,990
Must be a hack here too.

1491
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:53,170
Alright, this way.

1492
01:09:56,210 --> 01:09:57,350
It's not... Oh, there you go.

1493
01:09:58,130 --> 01:09:58,610
Yay!

1494
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:05,580
This may take a while.

1495
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:07,000
The system's locked me out.

1496
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,820
Oh shit, this is the... the gas chamber.

1497
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:13,340
Wait, it was a real gas chamber this entire time?

1498
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:15,120
Hey, welcome to the tomato farm!

1499
01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:15,800
Welcome, welcome!

1500
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:18,780
Okay.

1501
01:10:18,940 --> 01:10:19,720
Oh wait, I can go up.

1502
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:23,440
Nice.

1503
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:26,140
What do I do up here though?

1504
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:30,480
I can go up, but what's the point?

1505
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:31,900
Really?

1506
01:10:31,980 --> 01:10:32,420
Let me do this!

1507
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:35,540
Okay, I need to blow this up.

1508
01:10:37,940 --> 01:10:38,660
Uhhhh...

1509
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:39,260
There you go.

1510
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:44,980
Surely nothing bad's gonna happen.

1511
01:10:46,140 --> 01:10:47,040
I'm underwear.

1512
01:10:50,140 --> 01:10:51,060
Yeah, see?

1513
01:10:51,420 --> 01:10:53,020
Oh no, that's still the gas.

1514
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:57,760
Wait, but where's the question mark?

1515
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:01,120
How do I do this?

1516
01:11:05,390 --> 01:11:06,110
Nooooooo!

1517
01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:11,360
Nooo, it's so far!

1518
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:15,140
I can't turn the fan off!

1519
01:11:15,620 --> 01:11:16,500
Come back later?

1520
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:18,800
That's code for I'm never coming back.

1521
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:23,940
Backtracking?

1522
01:11:25,060 --> 01:11:25,740
Nah...

1523
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:31,920
Let's see...

1524
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:33,140
I guess we go back here.

1525
01:11:39,890 --> 01:11:43,590
Room is the end of days for even the most celebrated killer.

1526
01:11:43,850 --> 01:11:44,370
What's that mean?

1527
01:11:44,930 --> 01:11:46,430
Bro, I'm on detective mode.

1528
01:11:46,950 --> 01:11:49,670
Can I get cancelled for beating up...

1529
01:11:50,270 --> 01:11:51,290
For beating him up?

1530
01:11:56,490 --> 01:11:57,410
Goddammit, Batman!

1531
01:11:58,090 --> 01:11:59,250
This is not good!

1532
01:12:01,470 --> 01:12:03,150
They need medical help!

1533
01:12:06,210 --> 01:12:07,590
Wait, who's that over there?

1534
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:08,390
Come on!

1535
01:12:13,780 --> 01:12:14,340
Oh.

1536
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:16,680
Oh no, he's dead.

1537
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:20,420
More teeth!

1538
01:12:21,180 --> 01:12:21,660
Teeth!

1539
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:22,820
Teeth!

1540
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:24,000
Teeth!

1541
01:12:25,420 --> 01:12:26,340
Teeth is important.

1542
01:12:27,020 --> 01:12:28,260
I guess here, right?

1543
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:32,820
Oh!

1544
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,940
Who has four walls, two sides, and one X-DNA?

1545
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:39,140
I actually don't know who that is.

1546
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:40,200
Alright.

1547
01:12:41,780 --> 01:12:42,440
Who dat?

1548
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:43,900
Did I already do this?

1549
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:44,800
I already did this hack.

1550
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:47,100
Oh well, get over there.

1551
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:48,080
So I can beat him up.

1552
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:50,900
Is that Two-Face?

1553
01:12:52,820 --> 01:12:53,940
Where Two-Face?

1554
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:56,580
Security guard.

1555
01:12:56,940 --> 01:12:57,000
Oh!

1556
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:58,500
How do I get this out?

1557
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:00,880
Wall...

1558
01:13:02,140 --> 01:13:03,960
Wall mounted and held with...

1559
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:04,820
Okay, I can't do that.

1560
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:05,300
Obviously.

1561
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:06,980
I'm so confused.

1562
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:13,040
Look for his old cell.

1563
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:15,060
Oh dead!

1564
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:15,720
There it is!

1565
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:18,840
That's his cell!

1566
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:25,900
District Attorney Harvey Dent was one of Batman's strongest allies in Gotham City.

1567
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:31,060
Until the criminal threw acid in Dent's face, headlessly scarring him.

1568
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:37,340
The wounds fractured his psyche and he was born as a schizoid criminal mastermind, obsessed with duality.

1569
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:46,600
His former good luck charm, a two-headed trick silver dollar, was damaged on one side in an attack, and Dent has seized on it as a reflection of his half scarred visage.

1570
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:50,560
On it as a reflection, he flips it to decide the fate of his victims.

1571
01:13:50,860 --> 01:14:02,420
Despite Batman's effort to reform his former ally, Dent is consumed by his fixation on chance, and his crimes are designated to design to prove out his diametric philosophy.

1572
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,100
Alright, how tall is he though?

1573
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:15,020
The most important question.

1574
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:16,680
How tall is he?

1575
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:21,880
Headlessly scarred on the left side when she plays out with Chloe, that's definitely solid.

1576
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:25,200
It's not like... oh I thought it was like a fun fact, but it's just an attribute.

1577
01:14:31,190 --> 01:14:33,330
The question, how tall is he?

1578
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:34,850
Where'd that go?

1579
01:14:37,310 --> 01:14:38,670
I'll always be last.

1580
01:14:44,450 --> 01:14:47,190
I'll never ever figure out where to go.

1581
01:14:50,210 --> 01:14:51,630
Do I stay here?

1582
01:14:54,230 --> 01:14:54,910
Clawgate?

1583
01:14:55,210 --> 01:14:56,690
Oh my claw!

1584
01:14:57,590 --> 01:14:59,030
I have so many... God!

1585
01:14:59,250 --> 01:15:00,830
Batman has so many gadgets.

1586
01:15:00,970 --> 01:15:01,550
I forgot.

1587
01:15:01,890 --> 01:15:02,830
I forgot.

1588
01:15:05,310 --> 01:15:07,150
Bro, I never use this.

1589
01:15:08,650 --> 01:15:12,090
Oh my god, his other... his useful tools.

1590
01:15:12,390 --> 01:15:13,010
Wow!

1591
01:15:13,690 --> 01:15:15,650
Where did... how did you get over here?

1592
01:15:17,090 --> 01:15:18,430
What the fuck?

1593
01:15:18,550 --> 01:15:19,890
Please don't cancel me.

1594
01:15:20,150 --> 01:15:22,130
He... it was self-defense.

1595
01:15:23,530 --> 01:15:24,550
It's him again.

1596
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:00,500
Bro, he's depressed because he can't kill.

1597
01:16:11,710 --> 01:16:13,910
Bro, we all want things, alright?

1598
01:16:14,030 --> 01:16:15,530
It's part of growing up.

1599
01:16:15,630 --> 01:16:17,170
Sometimes you don't get what you want.

1600
01:16:18,130 --> 01:16:19,410
Mofo, thank you for the super chat.

1601
01:16:19,470 --> 01:16:20,190
Thank you, thank you.

1602
01:16:20,270 --> 01:16:25,250
Do you think Batman sends people to Arkham Asylum knowing that they'll escape just so he could be...

1603
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:26,890
I think he has anger issues.

1604
01:16:27,210 --> 01:16:31,030
I think like he just wants to beat up his problem instead of actually rehabilitating.

1605
01:16:31,350 --> 01:16:35,510
Like, investing in like proper mental care to these people.

1606
01:16:35,790 --> 01:16:39,950
Like, majority of the criminals here are just like mentally unwell.

1607
01:16:39,950 --> 01:16:44,070
Like, there's literally like six nurses.

1608
01:16:44,570 --> 01:16:47,670
Like, six nurses in the entire Arkham Asylum.

1609
01:16:47,870 --> 01:16:51,970
And like, I feel like, you know, maybe if they have more nurses, you know?

1610
01:16:52,150 --> 01:17:03,810
Maybe if Arkham Asylum, a asylum, a mental hospital, assign more medical professionals, things would be a little better.

1611
01:17:03,890 --> 01:17:05,550
Instead of six nurses.

1612
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:18,260
If you think about it, like, that's the biggest issue I have with Batman.

1613
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:23,220
That's why I'm like lagging by like crazy for some reason.

1614
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:27,900
I'm like, like 30 FPS at the moment.

1615
01:17:30,260 --> 01:17:31,640
Give me a sec.

1616
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:35,080
I'm like 30 FPS for some fucking reason.

1617
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:39,860
Oh my god.

1618
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:41,580
You know what?

1619
01:17:41,980 --> 01:17:43,060
Give me a sec.

1620
01:17:43,180 --> 01:17:45,280
Let me reset this.

1621
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:51,000
Six nurses, electrical bill of one million.

1622
01:17:52,820 --> 01:17:53,540
Let's see.

1623
01:17:54,220 --> 01:17:54,780
Whoa.

1624
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:56,860
Why am I lagging so badly?

1625
01:17:57,140 --> 01:17:57,900
Maybe if I...

1626
01:17:57,900 --> 01:18:00,520
Okay, let me reset this real fast.

1627
01:18:03,140 --> 01:18:06,520
Like, there's a lot of like issues with Gotham.

1628
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:08,260
Because like...

1629
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,240
Gotham in general just has...

1630
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:15,940
It's not really the perfect city.

1631
01:18:16,180 --> 01:18:20,340
But yet like, for some reason, Gotham has like so many billionaires.

1632
01:18:20,380 --> 01:18:22,420
Maybe Gotham is like Texas.

1633
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:29,180
In a way that like taxes are like...

1634
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:31,660
The tax...

1635
01:18:31,660 --> 01:18:32,320
It's like...

1636
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:37,700
It's like the taxes are really like barely existent in Gotham.

1637
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:39,480
So like all the billionaires live...

1638
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:41,560
All the billionaires live there.

1639
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:42,400
I think like...

1640
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:43,680
Maybe like...

1641
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:46,640
The servers are like extra...

1642
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:48,080
I'm like semi...

1643
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:48,400
It's alright.

1644
01:18:49,140 --> 01:18:50,620
We're just gonna go retro.

1645
01:18:53,740 --> 01:18:57,880
Like I'm saying it's like Texas and more so like the tax...

1646
01:18:57,880 --> 01:19:00,400
There's like barely taxes in general.

1647
01:19:00,620 --> 01:19:01,880
So then like...

1648
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:04,640
That's why all the billionaires live in Texas.

1649
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:05,820
Not Texas.

1650
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:07,960
All the billionaires live in Gotham.

1651
01:19:08,020 --> 01:19:08,540
Hahaha.

1652
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:09,580
Hahaha.

1653
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:11,940
Alright, what do we upgrade?

1654
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:23,820
There's batteram power, twin batteram, sonic batteram, multiple...

1655
01:19:32,030 --> 01:19:33,070
Sonic batteram?

1656
01:19:33,250 --> 01:19:34,730
What does a sonic batteram do?

1657
01:19:35,330 --> 01:19:36,470
Okay, what does it do?

1658
01:19:36,630 --> 01:19:38,710
I swear to god you're making me upgrade a dumb...

1659
01:19:39,870 --> 01:19:46,430
Tune the resonant exact frequency nearest attracting the useful for luring a target into a trap or away from an area.

1660
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:49,490
One throw requires a short recharge period for the target.

1661
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:50,870
If we can get the target to use the thing that we want to.

1662
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:52,070
Oh, it lures them.

1663
01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:53,350
Why would I need to lure them?

1664
01:19:53,470 --> 01:19:54,670
I can just beat them up.

1665
01:19:54,930 --> 01:19:56,950
I guess I can use the lure...

1666
01:19:56,950 --> 01:19:58,590
I don't have any traps though.

1667
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:04,380
Alright, we'll do it.

1668
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:04,740
Fine.

1669
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:05,440
Fine.

1670
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:06,160
I'll do it.

1671
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:08,040
Alright.

1672
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:10,840
Is this another...

1673
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:12,600
Where I'll go?

1674
01:20:13,860 --> 01:20:14,260
Up?

1675
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:17,720
Scalem, thank you for the super chat.

1676
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:18,740
Thank you, thank you.

1677
01:20:21,580 --> 01:20:22,300
$100 nurses.

1678
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:22,380
What is it?

1679
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:35,400
I mean,

1680
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:44,720
Batman is willing to just throw away like his fucking car so easily.

1681
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:50,200
And that car is like, I would not be surprised if it's like a hundred million dollars.

1682
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:54,980
Like I would not be surprised at a hundred million dollar car right there.

1683
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:56,000
He doesn't care!

1684
01:20:57,700 --> 01:20:59,700
Hey, we're gonna need this.

1685
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:02,700
Stop buying bad themed gadgets.

1686
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:03,040
No.

1687
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:07,340
They're not even great gadgets too.

1688
01:21:13,770 --> 01:21:15,530
Oh yeah, I didn't see the hack here.

1689
01:21:28,060 --> 01:21:32,820
I hate the argument of like, how much prep time does Batman need?

1690
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:36,240
And people will be like, who's gonna win Batman vs X?

1691
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:38,480
And people will be like, how much prep time does he get?

1692
01:21:38,620 --> 01:21:40,400
Well, sometimes people don't get prep time.

1693
01:21:41,540 --> 01:21:43,880
Majority of the time, people will never get prep time.

1694
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:45,920
If you think about it.

1695
01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:53,660
Usually when something happens, it sometimes comes by surprise.

1696
01:21:54,540 --> 01:21:56,200
Why are we giving him prep time?

1697
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:07,840
A good villain would never give you prep time!

1698
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:09,380
It's always a surprise!

1699
01:22:28,430 --> 01:22:28,910
Where?

1700
01:22:28,910 --> 01:22:29,650
Oh, there.

1701
01:22:30,490 --> 01:22:30,970
Alright.

1702
01:22:31,610 --> 01:22:32,510
Give me a sec.

1703
01:22:33,630 --> 01:22:35,530
Let me beat up some people real quick.

1704
01:22:37,030 --> 01:22:39,150
Let me beat up some people real quick.

1705
01:22:39,230 --> 01:22:39,730
Oh, nice!

1706
01:22:40,370 --> 01:22:41,370
That's fucking right.

1707
01:22:41,450 --> 01:22:41,890
Get down!

1708
01:22:42,270 --> 01:22:43,330
Oh shit!

1709
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:44,270
Electricity!

1710
01:22:45,470 --> 01:22:45,990
Oh!

1711
01:22:50,110 --> 01:22:52,090
My floor is lava!

1712
01:22:54,610 --> 01:22:55,690
Floor is lava!

1713
01:22:57,390 --> 01:22:58,470
Alright, get out of here.

1714
01:22:59,890 --> 01:23:00,590
It's fine.

1715
01:23:00,630 --> 01:23:01,250
We're fine here.

1716
01:23:01,350 --> 01:23:02,490
It's not this floor.

1717
01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:07,830
Alright, let's heal.

1718
01:23:10,970 --> 01:23:12,330
Oh my god, where the fuck...

1719
01:23:12,330 --> 01:23:12,990
Oh, please!

1720
01:23:14,290 --> 01:23:15,130
That's so long!

1721
01:23:15,590 --> 01:23:16,330
Get me out of here!

1722
01:23:20,570 --> 01:23:22,410
Oh my god, that's so scary.

1723
01:23:23,610 --> 01:23:24,750
That's so fucking scary.

1724
01:23:29,050 --> 01:23:30,090
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1725
01:23:30,130 --> 01:23:30,530
Get me out!

1726
01:23:30,610 --> 01:23:30,930
Get me out!

1727
01:23:30,950 --> 01:23:31,270
Get me out!

1728
01:23:31,830 --> 01:23:32,150
Nice.

1729
01:23:33,590 --> 01:23:35,350
That's right, you can't fuck with me, Harley.

1730
01:23:36,090 --> 01:23:37,630
I like how they're just waiting there.

1731
01:23:37,950 --> 01:23:39,830
It's like, Harley, can we play now?

1732
01:23:40,210 --> 01:23:40,650
Can we?

1733
01:23:41,490 --> 01:23:43,510
Even the goons are like, move.

1734
01:23:44,170 --> 01:23:47,690
I like how they're like, can we come play now with Mr. Batman?

1735
01:23:51,970 --> 01:23:53,790
Is it time now?

1736
01:23:56,370 --> 01:23:57,270
Oh fuck.

1737
01:23:57,510 --> 01:23:59,030
I thought I got them.

1738
01:24:00,130 --> 01:24:01,890
Don't let him... just don't get hit!

1739
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:02,370
Oh!

1740
01:24:03,390 --> 01:24:04,150
Get out!

1741
01:24:05,090 --> 01:24:05,930
Oh shit!

1742
01:24:06,010 --> 01:24:06,510
Oh shit!

1743
01:24:08,190 --> 01:24:08,730
There we go.

1744
01:24:10,010 --> 01:24:11,110
I need to like...

1745
01:24:11,830 --> 01:24:12,670
Oh shit, no!

1746
01:24:15,890 --> 01:24:17,290
Why are you letting yourself get hit then?

1747
01:24:17,490 --> 01:24:18,110
Oh shit.

1748
01:24:18,650 --> 01:24:19,250
Get me out!

1749
01:24:19,330 --> 01:24:19,710
Get me out!

1750
01:24:21,850 --> 01:24:22,990
Oh, I hate that.

1751
01:24:25,590 --> 01:24:27,050
I'm so bad at this one.

1752
01:24:27,990 --> 01:24:28,350
Okay.

1753
01:24:29,350 --> 01:24:29,830
There we go.

1754
01:24:31,110 --> 01:24:31,470
Nice.

1755
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:34,230
That should be the last... nope, that's not the last guy.

1756
01:24:34,330 --> 01:24:34,570
Okay.

1757
01:24:34,970 --> 01:24:35,330
Alright.

1758
01:24:35,470 --> 01:24:36,370
We need the regen!

1759
01:24:36,610 --> 01:24:37,470
We need the regen!

1760
01:24:37,950 --> 01:24:38,230
Guys!

1761
01:24:38,450 --> 01:24:38,870
No!

1762
01:24:39,290 --> 01:24:39,890
No!

1763
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:44,840
No!

1764
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:45,620
No!

1765
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:46,800
It's the electricity guy!

1766
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:48,280
Oh!

1767
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:52,100
It's okay.

1768
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:53,880
I have a plan.

1769
01:24:55,380 --> 01:24:56,740
Okay, it was not this.

1770
01:24:57,780 --> 01:24:58,140
No!

1771
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:01,300
He can just kick me like that!

1772
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:02,220
Okay.

1773
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:03,560
I got a plan, guys.

1774
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:08,880
I got a plan.

1775
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:12,540
There we go.

1776
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:15,020
There we go.

1777
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:16,960
I got a plan!

1778
01:25:17,580 --> 01:25:19,900
If I keep running back and forth!

1779
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:22,240
I got a plan!

1780
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,260
Don't worry, I got a plan.

1781
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:28,160
Trust the process.

1782
01:25:33,050 --> 01:25:33,570
No!

1783
01:25:33,570 --> 01:25:33,790
No!

1784
01:25:33,790 --> 01:25:34,050
No!

1785
01:25:34,050 --> 01:25:34,250
No!

1786
01:25:37,790 --> 01:25:38,310
No!

1787
01:25:38,310 --> 01:25:39,630
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1788
01:25:39,710 --> 01:25:40,330
Trust the plan!

1789
01:25:43,950 --> 01:25:45,130
There we go.

1790
01:25:45,850 --> 01:25:46,550
No, no, no, no!

1791
01:25:46,570 --> 01:25:46,890
Woah!

1792
01:25:50,750 --> 01:25:51,150
Yes!

1793
01:25:53,950 --> 01:25:54,350
Okay.

1794
01:25:56,110 --> 01:25:56,510
Okay!

1795
01:25:56,510 --> 01:25:57,090
We're fine!

1796
01:25:58,350 --> 01:25:58,910
No, no, no!

1797
01:25:58,990 --> 01:25:59,830
Oh god, we're fine!

1798
01:26:01,930 --> 01:26:02,590
We're fine!

1799
01:26:03,670 --> 01:26:04,330
We're fine!

1800
01:26:06,730 --> 01:26:08,630
Why didn't you be in a dream?!

1801
01:26:10,110 --> 01:26:11,930
I should have given him more prep time.

1802
01:26:12,390 --> 01:26:13,090
What's up, kiddo?

1803
01:26:13,510 --> 01:26:15,250
But I tried my best!

1804
01:26:15,930 --> 01:26:18,970
Sorry, but there is no prize for second place!

1805
01:26:19,190 --> 01:26:21,130
I'm afraid to rob the party list.

1806
01:26:21,190 --> 01:26:22,130
What the fuck?!

1807
01:26:22,130 --> 01:26:22,530
Next time!

1808
01:26:23,410 --> 01:26:26,410
You're just gonna do that to a party like that?!

1809
01:26:26,950 --> 01:26:27,250
No!

1810
01:26:27,710 --> 01:26:28,870
So here she has Ivy.

1811
01:26:29,090 --> 01:26:30,990
Her best friend and roommate.

1812
01:26:42,220 --> 01:26:44,520
We've been easy with prep time.

1813
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:50,580
I'm not gonna let you do that!

1814
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:51,000
Wait, who's that?

1815
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:52,680
Why the smile's next to certain names?

1816
01:26:52,700 --> 01:26:52,960
Yeah.

1817
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:54,120
You're the detective?

1818
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:55,100
You tell me!

1819
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:57,860
No backseat me, Harley.

1820
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:01,760
Just punch her in the head like all the other ones!

1821
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:05,760
What?

1822
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:07,260
You won't hit a woman?

1823
01:27:08,460 --> 01:27:11,820
She killed more people than the Joker goons!

1824
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:13,220
You were fine, Mr. J!

1825
01:27:13,420 --> 01:27:15,460
He's in the secret lab in the gardens and...

1826
01:27:15,460 --> 01:27:16,060
Oh crap!

1827
01:27:16,540 --> 01:27:17,660
Yep, I know.

1828
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:19,980
You nearly killed more than the other guys!

1829
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:29,820
What the fuck?!

1830
01:27:29,820 --> 01:27:30,640
It should be equality!

1831
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:37,160
Oh, she's crying.

1832
01:27:38,220 --> 01:27:40,520
So you can find the secret lab in the gardens?

1833
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:41,400
Yes.

1834
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:43,840
Harley's been everywhere on the island.

1835
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:47,740
So I'm calibrating the scanner to only show prints that have traces of chlorophyll.

1836
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:48,520
Okay, listen.

1837
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:49,280
Be careful.

1838
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:50,860
I rerouted a way...

1839
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:53,400
I can fix her, but she's hot!

1840
01:27:53,820 --> 01:27:55,020
We're showing up hot.

1841
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:56,720
Something bad is happening there.

1842
01:27:58,300 --> 01:28:05,760
I don't think she's fixable.

1843
01:28:06,140 --> 01:28:06,440
Guys, I don't think she's fixable, guys.

1844
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:09,820
I don't think... I'm gonna use the backdrop to be right back.

1845
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:01,440
I don't

1846
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:14,820
think she's fixable.

1847
01:29:14,820 --> 01:29:16,160
Alright, I'm back.

1848
01:29:16,220 --> 01:29:17,400
Can you guys still fix her?

1849
01:29:21,420 --> 01:29:23,980
I can fix her with enough prep.

1850
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:26,140
Thank you for the super chat.

1851
01:29:26,240 --> 01:29:26,840
Thank you.

1852
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:27,780
Thank you.

1853
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:38,100
I'm saying is that I'm okay with giving these guys fucking concussions.

1854
01:29:38,420 --> 01:29:42,620
But like Harley who has killed so many people in two hours.

1855
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,800
I just put her in a fucking...

1856
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:45,260
cell.

1857
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:50,660
I just put her in a fucking prison cell.

1858
01:29:53,540 --> 01:29:54,740
Like what is this?

1859
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,120
Check the ice cell?

1860
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:00,160
There's an ice cell?

1861
01:30:00,540 --> 01:30:01,620
There's more than one?

1862
01:30:07,020 --> 01:30:08,740
Boy, there's so many shit going on.

1863
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:10,240
I beat up so many people.

1864
01:30:10,340 --> 01:30:11,140
Holy fuck.

1865
01:30:11,660 --> 01:30:12,980
Oh, there it is!

1866
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:13,320
Oh!

1867
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:14,520
There you go.

1868
01:30:15,780 --> 01:30:16,320
There you go.

1869
01:30:16,380 --> 01:30:16,740
I see it.

1870
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:17,460
Mr. Freeze.

1871
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:27,220
Victor Fries was a brilliant cryogenesis whose beloved wife Nora was stricken with a fatal degenerative disease.

1872
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:33,140
He placed her in suspended animation while obsessively searching for a way to cure her.

1873
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:46,100
The corporation that funded his research and Nora's life pulled the plug, triggering an accident that transformed Fries' body into a cold-blooded form that must always be kept below zero.

1874
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:48,460
At normal room temperature, he will die.

1875
01:30:48,740 --> 01:30:59,440
Wearing a number of freezing weapons, he wears protective armor in his quest to somehow bring back his lovely wife and avenge her fate, which he partly holds the Batman responsible for.

1876
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:00,960
What the fuck did Batman do?

1877
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:03,320
Was he the one that like pulled the funding?

1878
01:31:04,540 --> 01:31:06,200
Marcus, thank you for the future...

1879
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:07,820
Thank you for the future chat.

1880
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:08,840
Super chat.

1881
01:31:08,980 --> 01:31:09,460
Thank you.

1882
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:09,980
Thank you.

1883
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,300
I can fix it.

1884
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:12,860
Just trust the process.

1885
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:16,420
Oh yeah, what are the fun facts?

1886
01:31:16,580 --> 01:31:18,680
How tall... what is the most empowering fact?

1887
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:19,660
How tall is he?

1888
01:31:20,060 --> 01:31:20,780
Six feet.

1889
01:31:20,980 --> 01:31:21,860
Alright, professional.

1890
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:23,600
Specialty.

1891
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:24,120
Employees.

1892
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:24,640
Extensive.

1893
01:31:26,360 --> 01:31:26,960
Wait, what?

1894
01:31:27,020 --> 01:31:27,660
What about his wife?

1895
01:31:28,660 --> 01:31:29,860
What's that about his wife?

1896
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:32,840
Motivates grief and anger.

1897
01:31:32,940 --> 01:31:34,640
Oh shit, by spite, just like me!

1898
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:36,380
For real, for real.

1899
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:44,680
Let's see.

1900
01:31:45,420 --> 01:31:46,300
Oh, nice.

1901
01:31:46,900 --> 01:31:48,720
Jesus Christ, that's a lot of bodies.

1902
01:31:51,160 --> 01:31:52,500
I submit you.

1903
01:31:52,820 --> 01:31:54,500
Thank you for the super chat, Terminator.

1904
01:31:54,980 --> 01:31:55,460
Thank you.

1905
01:31:55,580 --> 01:31:55,920
Thank you.

1906
01:31:58,060 --> 01:31:59,580
Alright, is there anything over here?

1907
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:04,120
Oh, it just should be.

1908
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:05,000
Yeah, there should be a video.

1909
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:25,480
What is he saying?

1910
01:32:26,460 --> 01:32:27,280
Oh shit!

1911
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:29,000
How

1912
01:32:37,950 --> 01:32:39,870
the fuck is he stronger than the guard?

1913
01:32:41,210 --> 01:32:42,670
I would assume the guard is stronger than the guard.

1914
01:32:42,670 --> 01:32:44,130
The guards are more trained than him.

1915
01:32:44,290 --> 01:32:45,630
He's literally in an asylum.

1916
01:32:45,910 --> 01:32:46,630
There's no way.

1917
01:32:47,070 --> 01:32:50,870
There's no way he's getting the proteins necessary to keep up his muscle.

1918
01:32:53,470 --> 01:32:54,410
Poor Bill.

1919
01:32:54,750 --> 01:32:55,370
Poor me.

1920
01:32:57,430 --> 01:33:00,310
Hiring these god awful guards.

1921
01:33:02,710 --> 01:33:03,830
Alright, hacking time.

1922
01:33:04,070 --> 01:33:04,490
Wait, what?

1923
01:33:05,070 --> 01:33:05,870
Can I hack?

1924
01:33:07,530 --> 01:33:08,490
Currently inactive.

1925
01:33:08,630 --> 01:33:09,270
Oh, they're all inactive.

1926
01:33:09,270 --> 01:33:10,330
Oh wait, no, except for this one.

1927
01:33:16,340 --> 01:33:17,600
I guess it's sort of like prison.

1928
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:19,740
I mean, it is prison where they train.

1929
01:33:20,140 --> 01:33:28,040
All they do is fucking get buffed as fuck in prison and lifting weights and stuff.

1930
01:33:29,260 --> 01:33:39,780
I feel like if I was the warden of Arkham Asylum, I would not buy a gym.

1931
01:33:40,120 --> 01:33:40,520
Yeah.

1932
01:33:42,580 --> 01:33:46,560
I would be like, why the fuck would I give prisoners time to train and get buffed?

1933
01:33:47,900 --> 01:33:49,960
You fat ass caught in my trap!

1934
01:33:50,060 --> 01:33:50,500
No!

1935
01:33:52,300 --> 01:33:54,900
I'm so stu- Oh wow, never mind.

1936
01:33:57,280 --> 01:33:59,740
I got trapped by riddles!

1937
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:02,620
This is why you should not be a completionist.

1938
01:34:06,650 --> 01:34:06,930
Oh.

1939
01:34:08,470 --> 01:34:09,030
Nice.

1940
01:34:09,030 --> 01:34:12,050
They brought the animal before me.

1941
01:34:12,570 --> 01:34:15,730
Shameless and barking like a mad dog.

1942
01:34:16,070 --> 01:34:20,430
For what felt like days, I endured his boasts.

1943
01:34:20,610 --> 01:34:23,390
He took pleasure recounting his actions.

1944
01:34:24,110 --> 01:34:26,490
Cataloging his depraved crimes.

1945
01:34:26,930 --> 01:34:30,710
What should have been revenge turned to pity.

1946
01:34:31,450 --> 01:34:35,750
This poor dog needed my help.

1947
01:34:36,830 --> 01:34:37,710
Oh?

1948
01:34:39,250 --> 01:34:40,530
Wait, how do I get up?

1949
01:34:41,590 --> 01:34:42,570
Oh wait, there.

1950
01:34:42,710 --> 01:34:43,090
Wrapper!

1951
01:34:44,830 --> 01:34:45,390
Nice.

1952
01:34:45,670 --> 01:34:47,170
Okay, now...

1953
01:34:49,530 --> 01:34:50,590
Now I go...

1954
01:34:50,590 --> 01:34:54,490
I missed Calendar Man's cell?

1955
01:34:56,410 --> 01:34:58,510
Which one is Calendar Man's cell?

1956
01:34:58,710 --> 01:35:00,610
God, there's so many fucking bodies.

1957
01:35:03,550 --> 01:35:07,190
Wait, all I'm saying is that I would never have...

1958
01:35:07,190 --> 01:35:08,350
Like, I would never...

1959
01:35:09,650 --> 01:35:11,170
Have a gym...

1960
01:35:11,170 --> 01:35:12,830
For my prison.

1961
01:35:13,230 --> 01:35:15,350
Because I do not want them to get buff.

1962
01:35:20,220 --> 01:35:21,500
Like, what's the point?

1963
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:23,420
Why am I training them to be like...

1964
01:35:23,420 --> 01:35:24,220
Better people?

1965
01:35:24,360 --> 01:35:27,560
Why am I training them to be buff people to kill again?

1966
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:28,820
Like, I think that's stupid.

1967
01:35:31,940 --> 01:35:32,860
Where do I go?

1968
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:34,600
I'm sick.

1969
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:41,360
Track Harley's fingerprints where?

1970
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:41,760
Where?

1971
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:44,320
Where is her fingerprints?

1972
01:35:45,140 --> 01:35:45,940
Do I...

1973
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:47,680
Do I go back?

1974
01:35:48,380 --> 01:35:49,520
Oh, wait, is that door?

1975
01:35:49,640 --> 01:35:50,160
That's a door!

1976
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:52,000
Wait, no.

1977
01:35:53,320 --> 01:35:54,120
No, wait.

1978
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:55,040
Wait.

1979
01:35:56,900 --> 01:35:57,680
Oh, no.

1980
01:36:00,220 --> 01:36:01,540
Do I go backwards?

1981
01:36:02,660 --> 01:36:03,960
I must go backwards.

1982
01:36:04,020 --> 01:36:05,260
There's nowhere else to go.

1983
01:36:07,620 --> 01:36:09,120
What did you touch, Harley?

1984
01:36:09,700 --> 01:36:10,860
Oh, yeah, it's backwards.

1985
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:11,200
Okay.

1986
01:36:12,260 --> 01:36:12,960
It's backwards.

1987
01:36:13,120 --> 01:36:13,300
Okay.

1988
01:36:13,420 --> 01:36:14,520
That Arkham Isle.

1989
01:36:14,580 --> 01:36:15,240
Okay, I got it.

1990
01:36:15,260 --> 01:36:15,900
I figured it out.

1991
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:18,420
I figured it out.

1992
01:36:18,820 --> 01:36:19,580
It's up here.

1993
01:36:19,820 --> 01:36:21,100
We're always lost.

1994
01:36:22,100 --> 01:36:23,700
That's my secret chat.

1995
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:25,220
We're always lost.

1996
01:36:27,040 --> 01:36:27,880
Alright, this way.

1997
01:36:29,300 --> 01:36:29,900
This way.

1998
01:36:30,020 --> 01:36:30,740
Oh, God.

1999
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:33,220
I was not... I did not realize that was a gift.

2000
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:34,660
There's the loose cap.

2001
01:36:34,900 --> 01:36:36,080
She did an okay job.

2002
01:36:36,660 --> 01:36:37,700
Let's call it a deal.

2003
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:41,060
But between you and me...

2004
01:36:41,060 --> 01:36:41,180
But between you and me...

2005
01:36:41,180 --> 01:36:43,220
I'm aiming for the A grade.

2006
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:49,680
Just go to mix a couple more of these chemicals, and I'll be creating my own personal army.

2007
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:50,400
Ha!

2008
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:55,700
I guess you don't have to pay them, too.

2009
01:36:55,980 --> 01:36:58,060
Because they'll be too stupid to want money.

2010
01:36:58,580 --> 01:37:00,780
If you, like, expose them to the chemicals.

2011
01:37:01,100 --> 01:37:02,040
That's pretty smart.

2012
01:37:02,360 --> 01:37:04,200
What do you think about there's so many riddles?

2013
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:06,320
I'm just going to pretend I didn't see it.

2014
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:08,720
Oh!

2015
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:11,200
This is Calendar Man!

2016
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:12,660
So, where's Calendar Man?

2017
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:14,420
Look at that!

2018
01:37:14,420 --> 01:37:15,020
See, guys?

2019
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:16,340
I'm not that stupid.

2020
01:37:17,100 --> 01:37:19,580
I recognize this riddle for Calendar Man.

2021
01:37:22,280 --> 01:37:22,840
Okay.

2022
01:37:23,160 --> 01:37:26,820
No, Joker apparently pays really well because he doesn't do shit for money.

2023
01:37:29,080 --> 01:37:30,960
Like, he does this for, like...

2024
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:32,660
He doesn't care about money.

2025
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:35,400
So, he actually pays really, really well.

2026
01:37:35,900 --> 01:37:38,700
Because he doesn't care about the money that he gets.

2027
01:37:38,700 --> 01:37:39,760
From the heist.

2028
01:37:39,960 --> 01:37:41,060
All he does...

2029
01:37:41,060 --> 01:37:42,700
He cares about is mayhem.

2030
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:44,980
So, he gives away all the money...

2031
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:47,760
To his...

2032
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:49,020
Yeah, it's about the message.

2033
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:50,620
So, he pays...

2034
01:37:50,620 --> 01:37:53,420
He's actually a really nice boss when it comes to the money.

2035
01:37:53,680 --> 01:37:55,080
Not the other stuff, though.

2036
01:37:59,180 --> 01:38:01,180
The other stuff is different.

2037
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:02,340
But, like...

2038
01:38:02,340 --> 01:38:02,840
Oh, there it is.

2039
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:03,440
This has to...

2040
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:04,380
Hey, guys!

2041
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:06,400
Where do you guys think is Calendar Man's cell?

2042
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:08,320
Do you think it's the one filled with calendars?

2043
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:09,340
Uh...

2044
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:15,880
Calendar Man!

2045
01:38:18,940 --> 01:38:20,960
God, that outfit is so stupid.

2046
01:38:23,220 --> 01:38:26,460
Fixated on the calendar, Julian Day became Calendar Man.

2047
01:38:26,660 --> 01:38:31,320
A villain who timed and tied his crimes thematically to certain holidays throughout the year.

2048
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:33,640
Often leaving clues by which he could be caught.

2049
01:38:33,940 --> 01:38:37,680
Gotham City's hopes for a day off are often clouded by the knowledge that...

2050
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:41,800
any holiday of note is likely to be shadowed by Calendar Man's presence.

2051
01:38:42,140 --> 01:38:42,940
Then, like...

2052
01:38:42,940 --> 01:38:45,080
Don't release him on holidays!

2053
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:48,640
On holidays, you put him on house arrest!

2054
01:38:49,120 --> 01:38:50,640
Because he has a pattern!

2055
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:52,920
Gotham!

2056
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:59,040
Just put him on house arrest on holidays!

2057
01:39:03,560 --> 01:39:05,580
Don't have a holiday in Goth...

2058
01:39:05,580 --> 01:39:06,100
You know what?

2059
01:39:06,100 --> 01:39:08,040
Just don't have a holiday in Gotham City!

2060
01:39:11,220 --> 01:39:12,980
He escapes, obviously.

2061
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:15,820
Well, cap him on 24 hours of...

2062
01:39:15,820 --> 01:39:17,640
There's not enough holidays in the world.

2063
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:18,440
Guys.

2064
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:19,680
There's...

2065
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:21,540
First off, there's not a lot of holidays.

2066
01:39:21,580 --> 01:39:23,600
So you can use one day on...

2067
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:25,220
You can use the holidays to...

2068
01:39:25,220 --> 01:39:26,840
to fucking...

2069
01:39:26,840 --> 01:39:28,900
Make sure he doesn't escape.

2070
01:39:29,860 --> 01:39:32,180
As he's getting away with...

2071
01:39:32,180 --> 01:39:32,700
with...

2072
01:39:32,700 --> 01:39:33,920
this...

2073
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:35,440
Just go somewhere else!

2074
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:37,960
Clearly, his only crime is in Gotham City!

2075
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:40,920
So have a vacation outside of Gotham!

2076
01:39:42,020 --> 01:39:43,920
What about birthdays?

2077
01:39:44,420 --> 01:39:47,900
Okay, I don't think Calendar Man gives a fuck about birthdays, guys.

2078
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:50,300
That's not a holiday.

2079
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:52,320
Your boss is not gonna give you a holiday.

2080
01:39:52,580 --> 01:39:53,780
Because it's your birthday.

2081
01:39:54,140 --> 01:39:55,460
Don't fucking...

2082
01:39:57,200 --> 01:39:57,460
Guys.

2083
01:39:59,220 --> 01:40:01,600
Guys, you go to work on your birthday.

2084
01:40:01,720 --> 01:40:03,120
Welcome to adult life.

2085
01:40:03,120 --> 01:40:03,760
I'm sorry.

2086
01:40:06,780 --> 01:40:09,880
You're fucking working on your holiday, guys.

2087
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:23,980
Stop talking.

2088
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:55,590
That is definitely news.

2089
01:40:56,230 --> 01:40:58,210
We don't have proof, but he's definitely dead.

2090
01:40:59,410 --> 01:41:01,170
I like how someone was like...

2091
01:41:01,570 --> 01:41:03,450
Badoki, my birthday is on summer break.

2092
01:41:03,770 --> 01:41:05,490
I hate to break it to you.

2093
01:41:05,650 --> 01:41:06,710
But like...

2094
01:41:07,270 --> 01:41:10,350
For some jobs, there's no summer break.

2095
01:41:13,310 --> 01:41:15,330
In the adult world.

2096
01:41:22,330 --> 01:41:23,550
Okay, let's see.

2097
01:41:23,590 --> 01:41:24,370
We have to go this way.

2098
01:41:27,230 --> 01:41:28,630
No, don't tell him.

2099
01:41:28,950 --> 01:41:31,070
No, don't tell him that!

2100
01:41:32,390 --> 01:41:32,890
No!

2101
01:41:35,330 --> 01:41:35,830
Please.

2102
01:41:35,910 --> 01:41:36,690
I'm trying to talk to him.

2103
01:41:36,690 --> 01:41:37,410
I'm trying to talk to my chat, sir.

2104
01:41:39,550 --> 01:41:41,350
Why would you tell him that?

2105
01:41:41,450 --> 01:41:42,030
Wait, is he stuck?

2106
01:41:42,170 --> 01:41:44,670
I thought he was, like, stuck in the fucking...

2107
01:41:45,470 --> 01:41:46,490
Stuck in the wall.

2108
01:41:46,870 --> 01:41:47,930
Wait, can I open this?

2109
01:41:48,170 --> 01:41:48,610
Oh, shit.

2110
01:41:48,630 --> 01:41:48,870
I can.

2111
01:41:49,830 --> 01:41:50,190
Wait.

2112
01:41:50,650 --> 01:41:51,010
Open.

2113
01:41:51,370 --> 01:41:52,790
Oh, I can be here too.

2114
01:41:52,890 --> 01:41:54,830
I can be just like you, sir.

2115
01:41:57,390 --> 01:41:57,750
No.

2116
01:41:57,810 --> 01:41:58,470
Santa is real.

2117
01:41:58,510 --> 01:41:58,810
Don't worry.

2118
01:41:58,950 --> 01:42:00,490
At least that's one thing we can count on.

2119
01:42:01,190 --> 01:42:02,830
Santa is a mutant in the X-men.

2120
01:42:04,570 --> 01:42:05,390
Is that a wrap?

2121
01:42:05,410 --> 01:42:05,670
Thank you.

2122
01:42:05,670 --> 01:42:06,510
Oh,

2123
01:42:17,140 --> 01:42:22,440
so like, you're not rather... like, I don't care about these guys now being out.

2124
01:42:25,700 --> 01:42:28,740
Because they're like, weaker than the other goons.

2125
01:42:50,190 --> 01:42:52,390
Oh, do you think there's...

2126
01:43:00,910 --> 01:43:02,650
Alright, this should be...

2127
01:43:02,650 --> 01:43:04,890
Do I have to unlock more in the Easter egg time?

2128
01:43:05,570 --> 01:43:06,430
Let me check.

2129
01:43:08,550 --> 01:43:10,210
Madison, think of a super chat thinky think.

2130
01:43:10,350 --> 01:43:10,470
Oh!

2131
01:43:10,670 --> 01:43:12,070
He has a different pose now!

2132
01:43:14,090 --> 01:43:15,070
He's so quirky.

2133
01:43:38,150 --> 01:43:39,070
Which one?

2134
01:43:40,310 --> 01:43:44,690
Well, there's a reason why I have like, five hundred robins.

2135
01:43:46,870 --> 01:43:49,070
I'm done playing with you right now.

2136
01:43:49,590 --> 01:43:51,410
Time for a new robin.

2137
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:58,020
Alright, let's see.

2138
01:43:59,080 --> 01:44:01,080
These guys are so fucking weak.

2139
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:02,580
Like, I just slap him once.

2140
01:44:03,960 --> 01:44:08,340
Like, I'm just like, am I supposed to be scared of these guys?

2141
01:44:08,340 --> 01:44:11,760
I'm not gonna have like, the regular Joker goons.

2142
01:44:12,540 --> 01:44:15,100
The regular ones are at least more of a challenge.

2143
01:44:15,380 --> 01:44:17,180
These guys are just... it's just sad.

2144
01:44:18,940 --> 01:44:19,700
Oh, wait.

2145
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:22,960
Wait, what?

2146
01:44:26,080 --> 01:44:28,540
Oh shit, what the fuck is going on?

2147
01:44:30,420 --> 01:44:31,500
Oh, it's this side.

2148
01:44:36,610 --> 01:44:39,010
How did they beat up the guys with guns?

2149
01:44:39,310 --> 01:44:40,890
They're literally one shot!

2150
01:44:40,890 --> 01:44:42,910
How did you die?

2151
01:44:43,130 --> 01:44:43,590
How did you die?

2152
01:44:43,590 --> 01:44:45,270
They're so weak!

2153
01:44:48,730 --> 01:44:49,650
Help!

2154
01:45:07,590 --> 01:45:09,290
I'm too strong.

2155
01:45:09,550 --> 01:45:10,890
They have guns!

2156
01:45:12,550 --> 01:45:13,870
Okay, it's this way.

2157
01:45:21,970 --> 01:45:22,530
Wow.

2158
01:45:31,580 --> 01:45:33,100
Oh my... this is sad.

2159
01:45:33,260 --> 01:45:34,220
I'm... this is so sad.

2160
01:45:34,340 --> 01:45:34,740
Please stop.

2161
01:45:36,860 --> 01:45:38,460
This is too sad.

2162
01:45:38,660 --> 01:45:39,240
Please stop.

2163
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:41,920
Please stop.

2164
01:45:42,200 --> 01:45:42,520
It's...

2165
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:46,200
Dogs are supposed to get harder, not easier.

2166
01:45:46,540 --> 01:45:47,220
Come on.

2167
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:49,720
What a... Joker, you fucking fell off.

2168
01:45:51,860 --> 01:45:55,740
Like, the fact that it just takes one hit is... that's the saddest part.

2169
01:45:58,600 --> 01:45:59,560
What's the riddle?

2170
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:01,480
I already forgot the riddle.

2171
01:46:01,660 --> 01:46:02,660
It's the free XP.

2172
01:46:03,420 --> 01:46:05,020
Thank you for the free XP.

2173
01:46:07,100 --> 01:46:08,940
The fuck is the riddle?

2174
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:13,520
Batman is too strong.

2175
01:46:15,500 --> 01:46:16,400
Wait, deceased?

2176
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:19,820
Oh no, he's okay.

2177
01:46:19,900 --> 01:46:20,940
These guys are deceased.

2178
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:24,300
In the graveyard?

2179
01:46:24,460 --> 01:46:25,520
Oh, it's on the other side.

2180
01:46:25,700 --> 01:46:25,940
Okay.

2181
01:46:27,340 --> 01:46:29,920
I thought like... it was like... uh...

2182
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:33,640
Okay, I thought it was like in that little hole that we're in.

2183
01:46:34,060 --> 01:46:35,240
Alright, come over here.

2184
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:36,320
Teeth!

2185
01:46:38,220 --> 01:46:38,700
Teeth!

2186
01:46:39,320 --> 01:46:39,800
Teeth!

2187
01:46:40,580 --> 01:46:41,300
There you go.

2188
01:46:42,760 --> 01:46:44,980
Alright, we're gonna go to the gardens.

2189
01:46:45,700 --> 01:46:46,660
Poison Ivy!

2190
01:46:47,900 --> 01:46:49,560
I'm coming over!

2191
01:46:55,480 --> 01:46:55,920
Teeth!

2192
01:46:56,720 --> 01:46:59,640
Is the number up to the guards?

2193
01:47:05,030 --> 01:47:05,470
Oh.

2194
01:47:05,470 --> 01:47:06,950
Not botanical tab?

2195
01:47:08,910 --> 01:47:10,510
Oh no, it is the botanical tab.

2196
01:47:10,710 --> 01:47:11,170
Okay, locate.

2197
01:47:11,730 --> 01:47:12,450
Tracker thing.

2198
01:47:16,080 --> 01:47:17,200
Oh, there's your finger.

2199
01:47:17,240 --> 01:47:18,180
Wait, did she touch the floor?

2200
01:47:18,860 --> 01:47:20,420
Why the fuck did you touch the floor?

2201
01:47:22,420 --> 01:47:24,780
Oh, maybe she's like doing cartwheels, you know?

2202
01:47:25,340 --> 01:47:25,780
Maybe.

2203
01:47:27,060 --> 01:47:27,680
Wait, are they dead?

2204
01:47:27,900 --> 01:47:28,780
Oh, I was like...

2205
01:47:28,780 --> 01:47:30,700
Oh, how nice, they're reading books.

2206
01:47:32,420 --> 01:47:34,240
Why is she touching so many floors?

2207
01:47:40,260 --> 01:47:40,780
Okay.

2208
01:47:42,500 --> 01:47:43,540
Watch this.

2209
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:45,560
Okay.

2210
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:52,720
Wait, wait.

2211
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:55,360
Watch this.

2212
01:47:56,220 --> 01:47:56,740
Watch this.

2213
01:47:57,520 --> 01:47:58,140
Watch this.

2214
01:47:58,140 --> 01:47:58,360
Watch this.

2215
01:47:58,560 --> 01:47:59,040
Watch this.

2216
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:02,640
Come on.

2217
01:48:02,860 --> 01:48:02,980
Come on.

2218
01:48:03,720 --> 01:48:04,640
It worked!

2219
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:05,980
It's won!

2220
01:48:06,460 --> 01:48:07,500
One is something!

2221
01:48:12,860 --> 01:48:14,420
One is something!

2222
01:48:18,720 --> 01:48:20,400
It's that easy.

2223
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:22,400
Nice.

2224
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:23,380
Is the number up?

2225
01:48:23,420 --> 01:48:23,500
Is the number up?

2226
01:48:23,500 --> 01:48:24,420
You were ready to impress me, Batman.

2227
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:28,800
You may still reach a level just below my genius one day.

2228
01:48:30,460 --> 01:48:31,360
What the fuck?

2229
01:48:31,400 --> 01:48:32,160
What did you say?

2230
01:48:33,220 --> 01:48:35,080
Scrubs, thank you for the super chat!

2231
01:48:35,180 --> 01:48:35,560
Thank you!

2232
01:48:35,860 --> 01:48:40,440
Please put me in a vegetable state so Poison Ivy will love me.

2233
01:48:40,940 --> 01:48:41,420
Okay...

2234
01:48:45,200 --> 01:48:46,160
That's pretty good.

2235
01:48:46,380 --> 01:48:47,960
Poison Ivy will never love you.

2236
01:48:52,940 --> 01:48:54,720
Alright, what do we upgrade, guys?

2237
01:48:54,980 --> 01:48:56,620
What's the best upgrade to get?

2238
01:48:59,500 --> 01:49:00,680
I missed the tape.

2239
01:49:00,740 --> 01:49:01,320
Where's the tape?

2240
01:49:01,680 --> 01:49:02,900
Oh, tape on the bench?

2241
01:49:03,060 --> 01:49:03,260
Okay.

2242
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:07,940
You have to face reality right now!

2243
01:49:09,080 --> 01:49:10,560
She's never gonna love you!

2244
01:49:11,460 --> 01:49:12,700
You're not a plant!

2245
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:16,420
Even if you're a vegetable state, you don't have any greens in you!

2246
01:49:22,470 --> 01:49:23,610
The twin Bataran?

2247
01:49:23,790 --> 01:49:25,370
Okay, I'm gonna get the twin Bataran.

2248
01:49:25,810 --> 01:49:26,710
Combo Bataran?

2249
01:49:27,030 --> 01:49:28,550
What the fuck is Combo Bataran?

2250
01:49:32,200 --> 01:49:33,480
Oh shit, nice.

2251
01:49:33,540 --> 01:49:34,020
I'll do that.

2252
01:49:38,190 --> 01:49:39,790
I wanna plant, mommy.

2253
01:49:39,910 --> 01:49:41,410
Fucking date a florist!

2254
01:49:46,490 --> 01:49:48,010
It's less lethal!

2255
01:49:51,810 --> 01:49:53,510
There's no fucking...

2256
01:49:55,290 --> 01:49:56,650
There's no tape here.

2257
01:49:57,490 --> 01:49:58,810
Oh, there's tape here.

2258
01:50:02,980 --> 01:50:04,840
It's not the same!

2259
01:50:38,860 --> 01:50:39,520
It's a bigger world!

2260
01:50:39,800 --> 01:50:40,280
Alpha,

2261
01:50:45,110 --> 01:50:47,350
you tried to kill everyone in Gotham.

2262
01:50:47,490 --> 01:50:51,110
Well sometimes you need to broom back hard in order to make something flourish.

2263
01:50:52,570 --> 01:50:58,830
To be fair, if she was a real eco-terrorist, she would not be aiming for Gotham City.

2264
01:50:59,810 --> 01:51:02,990
Because she could just aim for the oil rigs in the ocean.

2265
01:51:03,690 --> 01:51:08,970
That's like owned by the entire... like by private corporations that's not in Gotham City.

2266
01:51:09,850 --> 01:51:10,410
What?

2267
01:51:11,730 --> 01:51:14,230
Not a real eco-terrorist.

2268
01:51:16,210 --> 01:51:17,490
Fucking rookie.

2269
01:51:26,290 --> 01:51:27,770
She's just a rookie.

2270
01:51:30,110 --> 01:51:32,310
You gotta start small.

2271
01:51:32,490 --> 01:51:34,870
If she wants to change the world!

2272
01:51:36,010 --> 01:51:38,530
She should not be aiming for small.

2273
01:51:41,090 --> 01:51:41,890
Poser.

2274
01:51:41,990 --> 01:51:43,150
What a fucking poser!

2275
01:51:46,570 --> 01:51:48,310
Where the fuck...

2276
01:51:48,310 --> 01:51:49,350
There you go.

2277
01:51:57,320 --> 01:51:59,300
She's like those fucking...

2278
01:51:59,300 --> 01:52:02,900
Those ones that threw paint on the Mona Lisa.

2279
01:52:05,400 --> 01:52:07,480
Oh wait, I almost ran this way.

2280
01:52:08,980 --> 01:52:11,080
They're just trying to get more...

2281
01:52:11,080 --> 01:52:16,160
The whole idea is that any publicity is good publicity.

2282
01:52:16,380 --> 01:52:17,700
So like...

2283
01:52:18,280 --> 01:52:19,140
Do they have guns?

2284
01:52:19,700 --> 01:52:20,700
Oh they do.

2285
01:52:20,940 --> 01:52:21,540
That's scary.

2286
01:52:22,080 --> 01:52:23,380
Oh that's a lot of them.

2287
01:52:24,240 --> 01:52:25,480
Or sorry, soup.

2288
01:52:25,780 --> 01:52:27,380
They threw soup at the Mona Lisa.

2289
01:52:27,780 --> 01:52:31,120
Because their idea is that any publicity is good publicity.

2290
01:52:31,600 --> 01:52:32,740
So they're like...

2291
01:52:34,340 --> 01:52:34,940
Oops.

2292
01:52:36,520 --> 01:52:37,420
Fuck that!

2293
01:52:38,200 --> 01:52:39,240
Ah shit!

2294
01:52:39,460 --> 01:52:40,440
Fly, fly, fly!

2295
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:43,860
It's okay.

2296
01:52:43,940 --> 01:52:44,640
They always forget.

2297
01:52:45,640 --> 01:52:46,540
But like...

2298
01:52:46,540 --> 01:52:48,160
It doesn't really work like that.

2299
01:52:49,620 --> 01:52:50,440
Wait there's...

2300
01:52:50,440 --> 01:52:51,480
Bullying!

2301
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:53,960
Bullying!

2302
01:52:57,440 --> 01:52:57,960
Bullying!

2303
01:52:58,800 --> 01:52:59,280
Bullying!

2304
01:53:04,600 --> 01:53:06,360
Okay wait, I can blow it again.

2305
01:53:08,180 --> 01:53:09,520
Don't worry, I can blow it again.

2306
01:53:09,680 --> 01:53:10,900
Wait, they had their guns again!

2307
01:53:12,840 --> 01:53:13,360
No!

2308
01:53:16,590 --> 01:53:17,670
My bully!

2309
01:53:21,110 --> 01:53:23,090
I salute my father!

2310
01:53:23,910 --> 01:53:26,190
I almost got a strike!

2311
01:53:28,690 --> 01:53:30,770
I almost got a strike guys.

2312
01:53:31,010 --> 01:53:32,530
It was so close.

2313
01:53:32,690 --> 01:53:33,170
No you sh...

2314
01:53:33,170 --> 01:53:34,410
Guys, no no no.

2315
01:53:34,530 --> 01:53:36,830
I almost got a strike guys.

2316
01:53:37,870 --> 01:53:39,970
I almost did it.

2317
01:53:39,990 --> 01:53:41,470
You don't understand!

2318
01:53:46,950 --> 01:53:47,870
There you go.

2319
01:53:49,190 --> 01:53:49,890
That's different.

2320
01:53:58,940 --> 01:53:59,700
Oh shit!

2321
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:01,260
No no no no no no no no no no!

2322
01:54:01,380 --> 01:54:02,340
Let me punch you!

2323
01:54:02,740 --> 01:54:03,380
There you go.

2324
01:54:04,620 --> 01:54:06,500
Alright, it's fine.

2325
01:54:06,660 --> 01:54:06,960
It's fine.

2326
01:54:07,940 --> 01:54:09,500
How do I activate...

2327
01:54:09,500 --> 01:54:11,220
Okay, I don't have double batter hands yet.

2328
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:13,420
No!

2329
01:54:20,510 --> 01:54:20,930
No!

2330
01:54:23,410 --> 01:54:23,830
No!

2331
01:54:23,990 --> 01:54:24,010
Nope nope!

2332
01:54:24,890 --> 01:54:25,310
Yes!

2333
01:54:26,250 --> 01:54:26,670
No!

2334
01:54:28,780 --> 01:54:30,200
How did he get up so fast?

2335
01:54:34,780 --> 01:54:36,840
How did he get up so fast?

2336
01:54:37,040 --> 01:54:37,160
How did he get up so fast?

2337
01:54:37,160 --> 01:54:37,680
I don't understand!

2338
01:54:39,220 --> 01:54:39,840
No!

2339
01:54:45,440 --> 01:54:47,100
Joker, you ghoster!

2340
01:54:48,160 --> 01:54:49,520
Joker, you ghoster!

2341
01:54:49,720 --> 01:54:50,540
Joker's ghosting!

2342
01:54:51,420 --> 01:54:54,220
Also isolated, thank you for the 10 conventions.

2343
01:54:54,700 --> 01:54:55,320
Also isolated, thank you for the 10 conventions.

2344
01:54:55,320 --> 01:54:55,500
Thank you.

2345
01:54:57,640 --> 01:55:00,350
I can't believe he's a ghoster.

2346
01:55:02,040 --> 01:55:03,560
Fucking no integrity!

2347
01:55:04,220 --> 01:55:08,180
I can't believe my criminal doesn't have any integrity.

2348
01:55:08,660 --> 01:55:10,340
I can't believe my criminal doesn't have any integrity.

2349
01:55:10,340 --> 01:55:11,300
So fucked up.

2350
01:55:12,140 --> 01:55:12,340
So fucked up.

2351
01:55:12,540 --> 01:55:14,060
Just gonna...

2352
01:55:14,060 --> 01:55:15,160
Nothing?

2353
01:55:16,440 --> 01:55:18,220
That's so fucked up.

2354
01:55:19,940 --> 01:55:20,400
No.

2355
01:55:21,780 --> 01:55:22,240
Okay.

2356
01:55:24,700 --> 01:55:25,620
No.

2357
01:55:26,200 --> 01:55:26,900
No.

2358
01:55:28,300 --> 01:55:29,840
No you didn't.

2359
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:30,000
No you didn't.

2360
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:33,500
Get up.

2361
01:55:34,140 --> 01:55:35,100
Get up.

2362
01:55:37,100 --> 01:55:38,060
There you go.

2363
01:55:38,380 --> 01:55:39,720
This is my stealth.

2364
01:55:42,620 --> 01:55:45,020
This is my stealth, guys.

2365
01:55:45,380 --> 01:55:46,020
This is my stealth, guys.

2366
01:55:46,860 --> 01:55:47,500
No!

2367
01:55:49,980 --> 01:55:50,860
There you go.

2368
01:55:51,620 --> 01:55:52,260
Bye.

2369
01:55:52,480 --> 01:55:52,500
Bye.

2370
01:55:56,840 --> 01:55:57,480
No!

2371
01:56:00,020 --> 01:56:01,040
Get over here.

2372
01:56:01,200 --> 01:56:02,200
That's fucking right.

2373
01:56:03,500 --> 01:56:04,640
They can't see me.

2374
01:56:07,180 --> 01:56:08,080
Get over here.

2375
01:56:12,550 --> 01:56:13,610
That's fucking right.

2376
01:56:13,650 --> 01:56:14,330
Get over here.

2377
01:56:14,610 --> 01:56:16,170
I told you I don't need stealth!

2378
01:56:17,330 --> 01:56:17,850
Boom!

2379
01:56:19,690 --> 01:56:21,730
Apparently I can cut them down too.

2380
01:56:22,290 --> 01:56:24,090
Guys, I learned something new.

2381
01:56:25,050 --> 01:56:25,570
Guys, I learned something new.

2382
01:56:25,570 --> 01:56:26,450
I can cut him...

2383
01:56:26,450 --> 01:56:27,030
Ow.

2384
01:56:27,730 --> 01:56:28,250
Okay.

2385
01:56:28,370 --> 01:56:28,870
Alright.

2386
01:56:29,990 --> 01:56:33,210
Him falling on his head is not a bad thing.

2387
01:56:34,310 --> 01:56:34,830
Okay.

2388
01:56:34,930 --> 01:56:36,030
How do I get this guy?

2472
01:59:32,730 --> 01:59:34,030

02:03:13,420 --> 02:03:14,080
It's gonna explode.

2580
02:03:14,940 --> 02:03:16,000
Oh my god.

2581
02:03:16,040 --> 02:03:18,040
It's so difficult.

2582
02:03:18,040 --> 02:03:19,220
What?

2583
02:03:21,200 --> 02:03:22,580
Wait, there's more than one?

2584
02:03:26,020 --> 02:03:26,900
There you go.

2585
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:28,220
Oh, there's three!

2586
02:03:30,020 --> 02:03:30,820
That's why!

2587
02:03:31,620 --> 02:03:32,620
That makes sense.

2588
02:03:34,020 --> 02:03:34,920
There you go.

2589
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:35,540
Easy.

2590
02:03:38,400 --> 02:03:39,040
Nice!

2591
02:03:39,220 --> 02:03:39,900
I did it!

2592
02:03:46,240 --> 02:03:47,980
Maybe just leave.

2593
02:03:49,980 --> 02:03:51,820
Actually, no, they can't leave because it's an island.

2594
02:03:52,620 --> 02:03:54,300
I was wondering, where are the boats?

2595
02:03:56,680 --> 02:03:58,200
Sorry, he can't just leave.

2596
02:03:59,260 --> 02:04:01,060
Yeah, but like, Poison Ivy.

2597
02:04:01,320 --> 02:04:03,660
Why would you think it's the last place people will be?

2598
02:04:03,780 --> 02:04:05,020
It's literally Poison Ivy.

2599
02:04:05,080 --> 02:04:06,100
What the fuck?

2600
02:04:06,780 --> 02:04:07,700
Where are all these?

2601
02:04:10,100 --> 02:04:11,660
Are these things at the bottom?

2602
02:04:11,780 --> 02:04:13,160
Oh, it's the booby traps.

2603
02:04:13,400 --> 02:04:13,840
Okay.

2604
02:04:16,280 --> 02:04:17,320
What do I do?

2605
02:04:20,920 --> 02:04:21,620
Wait, can't I...

2606
02:04:21,620 --> 02:04:22,020
Can't you swim?

2607
02:04:22,300 --> 02:04:22,600
Yeah.

2608
02:04:23,060 --> 02:04:24,120
Yeah, can't you swim?

2609
02:04:27,480 --> 02:04:28,920
Can't this guy fucking swim?

2610
02:04:31,880 --> 02:04:34,720
There's no sharks in fucking Goth... actually, there might be.

2611
02:04:34,860 --> 02:04:35,920
Because there's like, what's his name?

2612
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:36,340
King Shark?

2613
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:39,220
Never mind.

2614
02:04:39,400 --> 02:04:41,240
There could be sharks because there's King Sharks.

2615
02:04:42,740 --> 02:04:43,520
I forgot.

2616
02:04:43,760 --> 02:04:45,300
In Gotham... Jesus Christ.

2617
02:04:45,400 --> 02:04:46,140
In Gotham City.

2618
02:04:56,890 --> 02:04:57,370
Hey!

2619
02:04:59,510 --> 02:04:59,730
All

2620
02:05:13,580 --> 02:05:15,160
those innocent citizens!

2621
02:05:16,220 --> 02:05:18,580
Alright, I'm just gonna... Sorry, Joker.

2622
02:05:30,420 --> 02:05:31,620
You were

2623
02:05:47,960 --> 02:06:02,540
a doc... She's still a doctor!

2624
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:04,820
She doesn't lose her doctorate!

2625
02:06:10,520 --> 02:06:11,040
What?

2626
02:06:11,040 --> 02:06:13,760
She's had platinum, but doesn't mean she didn't go to college!

2627
02:06:17,020 --> 02:06:19,220
What do you mean she were a doctor?

2628
02:06:19,520 --> 02:06:20,700
Did she lose her license?

2629
02:06:21,040 --> 02:06:23,100
Oh, she could have lost her license.

2630
02:06:27,960 --> 02:06:29,000
I forgot.

2631
02:06:29,120 --> 02:06:30,080
That can happen.

2632
02:06:30,340 --> 02:06:31,380
I forgot that can happen.

2633
02:06:39,650 --> 02:06:40,650
I forgot.

2634
02:06:40,810 --> 02:06:46,970
They could have possibly revoked her PhD from killing people.

2635
02:06:47,110 --> 02:06:47,530
You're right.

2636
02:06:47,830 --> 02:06:48,850
You're right!

2637
02:06:50,150 --> 02:06:52,130
Alright, then this one in the next room.

2638
02:06:56,760 --> 02:06:58,300
I can't believe it!

2639
02:06:58,520 --> 02:06:59,880
She lost her license!

2640
02:07:01,400 --> 02:07:04,440
I can't believe murder can make you lose your license!

2641
02:07:04,680 --> 02:07:05,340
That's a bit unfair!

2642
02:07:18,980 --> 02:07:19,880
You're right!

2643
02:07:20,040 --> 02:07:21,400
You can't revoke a PhD!

2644
02:07:22,100 --> 02:07:23,080
I can't believe I'm telling you when I visit.

2645
02:07:24,850 --> 02:07:27,290
I get so lonely on my own.

2646
02:07:27,410 --> 02:07:29,310
You don't want me to be lonely.

2647
02:07:33,720 --> 02:07:34,820
Just don't let me know.

2648
02:07:34,820 --> 02:07:35,300
Steven!

2649
02:07:36,380 --> 02:07:36,580
No.

2650
02:07:36,720 --> 02:07:38,340
You can trust me, Steven.

2651
02:07:38,340 --> 02:07:39,140
You beat her!

2652
02:07:40,280 --> 02:07:41,620
Now give me a kiss.

2653
02:07:41,980 --> 02:07:42,920
I can't.

2654
02:07:43,560 --> 02:07:44,960
He has a wife!

2655
02:07:46,740 --> 02:07:48,080
What's wrong with you?

2656
02:07:48,520 --> 02:07:49,120
Don't you love me?

2657
02:07:49,120 --> 02:07:50,020
You simp!

2658
02:07:50,460 --> 02:07:52,100
Call me Ivy.

2659
02:07:52,440 --> 02:07:53,340
Of course!

2660
02:07:53,340 --> 02:07:54,100
I love you.

2661
02:07:54,780 --> 02:07:55,680
Oh my god!

2662
02:07:56,200 --> 02:07:56,640
Homewrecker!

2663
02:07:59,440 --> 02:08:00,200
Oh, yeah!

2664
02:08:00,300 --> 02:08:02,020
How could she lose her fucking PhD?

2665
02:08:02,240 --> 02:08:03,240
She's still a doctor!

2666
02:08:03,860 --> 02:08:05,180
She's still Dr. Ivy.

2667
02:08:06,980 --> 02:08:10,140
All these doctors have that I can fix them attitude.

2668
02:08:10,420 --> 02:08:11,980
Barley, thank you for the super chat.

2669
02:08:12,080 --> 02:08:12,440
Thank you.

2670
02:08:12,460 --> 02:08:12,960
Thank you.

2671
02:08:19,870 --> 02:08:21,950
We're all Steven's gator.

2672
02:08:22,030 --> 02:08:23,350
Thank you for the super chat.

2673
02:08:23,450 --> 02:08:23,950
Thank you.

2674
02:08:23,970 --> 02:08:24,610
Thank you.

2675
02:08:29,030 --> 02:08:31,230
You guys won't leave me for Ivy, right?

2676
02:08:33,190 --> 02:08:34,370
Wow, Mad Hatter!

2677
02:08:34,490 --> 02:08:36,610
Okay, which one's the Mad Hatter?

2678
02:08:37,010 --> 02:08:37,870
Oh, there it is.

2679
02:08:37,950 --> 02:08:38,450
Is that the Mad Hatter?

2680
02:08:38,470 --> 02:08:38,890
No, that's not.

2681
02:08:39,410 --> 02:08:39,890
Guys.

2682
02:08:40,930 --> 02:08:42,530
Guys, I'm serious guys.

2683
02:08:42,910 --> 02:08:44,910
What does Ivy have that I can't provide?

2684
02:08:45,630 --> 02:08:47,370
I can provide entertainment.

2685
02:08:48,210 --> 02:08:57,430
LOL LOL LOL Would she play Batman Arkham Asylum?

2686
02:08:57,430 --> 02:08:57,690
Adam?

2687
02:08:58,630 --> 02:08:59,590
What's my PhD?

2688
02:08:59,590 --> 02:09:00,230
Okay, look.

2689
02:09:01,050 --> 02:09:04,150
She can't even practice her fucking doctorate!

2690
02:09:06,470 --> 02:09:08,430
Her PhD is useless!

2691
02:09:11,170 --> 02:09:13,390
Also, where the fuck is the Mad Hatter puzzle?

2692
02:09:18,560 --> 02:09:21,060
She can't, just not legally.

2693
02:09:29,480 --> 02:09:33,960
Oh, so now she's not... she was never a real doctor anyway!

2694
02:09:34,360 --> 02:09:35,080
It's a PhD!

2695
02:09:35,620 --> 02:09:37,980
It's not even a medical doctor!

2696
02:09:38,260 --> 02:09:39,400
It's just professors!

2697
02:09:40,080 --> 02:09:43,440
It's just a PhD professor!

2698
02:09:44,160 --> 02:09:48,360
She writes research papers, not fucking cures cancer!

2699
02:09:53,400 --> 02:09:55,740
Okay, but like, you know... oh, there it is.

2700
02:09:56,580 --> 02:10:01,080
But like, I'm not trying to say professors do not deserve to be called doctors.

2701
02:10:01,220 --> 02:10:02,380
I just want you guys to know that.

2702
02:10:07,280 --> 02:10:11,840
I'm just saying that like, you guys are saying she's a medical doctor, but she is not a medical doctor.

2703
02:10:11,940 --> 02:10:13,120
She is a theoretical doctor.

2704
02:10:17,760 --> 02:10:19,660
Several people are typing.

2705
02:10:22,100 --> 02:10:27,500
Obsessed from a young age with Lewis Carroll's book of Alice Adventures in Wonderland, Jarvis is...

2706
02:10:29,660 --> 02:10:37,480
Jarvis Tech, an expert hypnotist, embraced the delusion that he was the incarnation of a character in the story, the Mad Hatter.

2707
02:10:37,600 --> 02:10:47,180
Using his skills for mesmerism, the Mad Hatter has committed many crimes, often themed around the book that inspired him and his love of hats and headgear.

2708
02:10:47,260 --> 02:10:48,700
Oh my god, he plays Team Fortress 2!

2709
02:10:50,020 --> 02:10:57,240
Doing so far as to implant his hats with mind-controlled chips to amplify his hypnosis skills.

2710
02:10:57,240 --> 02:11:05,960
Above all other headwear, however, he covets Batman's distinctive cowl and will stop at no- Just fucking hire a cosplayer!

2711
02:11:08,280 --> 02:11:11,380
Make it- Oh yeah, it's a collector's item.

2712
02:11:11,740 --> 02:11:17,140
Oh, he wants especially one of a kind items.

2713
02:11:20,400 --> 02:11:21,440
Alright, where do I go?

2714
02:11:22,260 --> 02:11:23,240
It's this way.

2715
02:11:25,380 --> 02:11:27,200
He wants the real thing.

2716
02:11:29,700 --> 02:11:33,120
He wants the one of a kind collecti- Okay, but like...

2717
02:11:33,120 --> 02:11:35,520
Batman does not have one Batsuit.

2718
02:11:35,660 --> 02:11:36,500
That's all I'm gonna say.

2719
02:11:36,840 --> 02:11:39,700
There's no way he has one Batsuit.

2720
02:11:41,700 --> 02:11:47,180
Just give- Just give him the cowl to stop so he can stop- He's also schizophrenic?

2721
02:11:47,180 --> 02:11:48,500
They're all schizophrenic!

2722
02:11:49,400 --> 02:11:50,960
There's a pattern, Batman!

2723
02:11:51,760 --> 02:11:52,660
Oh shit.

2724
02:11:53,760 --> 02:11:56,360
At this rate, you'll never catch me!

2725
02:11:56,740 --> 02:11:57,200
AHHHH!

2726
02:11:57,200 --> 02:12:06,860
Batman, if the- If the majority of the villain is schizophrenic, maybe the issue is the schizophrenia that's running around fucking Gotham City!

2727
02:12:10,080 --> 02:12:12,240
He's also schizophrenic!

2728
02:12:12,280 --> 02:12:16,400
I swear, 80% of these villains are just schizophrenic!

2729
02:12:18,980 --> 02:12:19,320
Look!

2730
02:12:22,260 --> 02:12:23,620
Delusion schizophrenic!

2731
02:12:27,200 --> 02:12:28,280
There must be some- You know what?

2732
02:12:28,320 --> 02:12:29,260
It might be the water, honestly.

2733
02:12:29,440 --> 02:12:33,460
I feel like this is- There's something wrong with the gene pool in Gotham City.

2734
02:12:36,820 --> 02:12:44,240
Like, it's like Australia, where like all the criminals got like- Got like deported to Australia a long time ago.

2735
02:12:45,140 --> 02:12:48,680
Like, I feel like at this point, there's- There's- There has to be a pattern.

2736
02:13:07,600 --> 02:13:09,800
Like, there's something has to be in the water!

2737
02:13:10,080 --> 02:13:12,800
Or like, medical history, there's something wrong!

2738
02:13:14,920 --> 02:13:15,500
Batman!

2739
02:13:18,520 --> 02:13:19,100
Please!

2740
02:13:19,140 --> 02:13:23,080
Fund the medical facilities in Gotham City, Batman!

2741
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:25,100
That's all we need!

2742
02:13:26,460 --> 02:13:28,280
We can fix it so easily!

2743
02:13:35,810 --> 02:13:37,330
It's always the water.

2744
02:13:44,060 --> 02:13:44,980
Oh no.

2745
02:13:46,080 --> 02:13:47,660
Oh hey, we're gonna need this.

2746
02:13:47,860 --> 02:13:48,360
Oh no.

2747
02:13:48,540 --> 02:13:50,100
Why is there mushrooms here?

2748
02:13:55,120 --> 02:13:55,660
Oh.

2749
02:14:00,880 --> 02:14:01,980
Here we go.

2750
02:14:05,360 --> 02:14:05,900
Nice.

2751
02:14:09,180 --> 02:14:12,980
Can't believe you blame my felonies on my genetics!

2752
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:16,620
It's like the murder genes!

2753
02:14:16,840 --> 02:14:17,380
Whoops, sorry.

2754
02:14:17,700 --> 02:14:19,960
It's like the murder genes from Riverdale!

2755
02:14:32,690 --> 02:14:36,760
I'll make sure there's- Oh, it's so nice that the mod gets rid of the flashbang.

2756
02:14:37,330 --> 02:14:38,510
It's actually so nice.

2757
02:14:38,510 --> 02:14:39,550
It's so fucking nice, man.

2758
02:14:41,490 --> 02:14:42,370
Holy shit.

2759
02:14:42,570 --> 02:14:45,530
The shadows can only be seen by those with a different view of life.

2760
02:14:45,730 --> 02:14:46,790
What the fuck does that mean?

2761
02:14:50,560 --> 02:14:51,000
What?

2762
02:14:52,020 --> 02:14:53,280
What the fuck is that?

2763
02:15:00,780 --> 02:15:01,220
Joker?

2764
02:15:10,830 --> 02:15:11,270
Ooh.

2765
02:15:11,530 --> 02:15:12,710
I don't like this.

2766
02:15:19,190 --> 02:15:21,130
I don't like this, Joker!

2767
02:15:23,570 --> 02:15:25,370
Where the fuck do I get out of here?

2768
02:15:25,470 --> 02:15:25,830
Oh, this way.

2769
02:15:27,330 --> 02:15:27,610
Wheeee!

2770
02:15:29,610 --> 02:15:31,590
I missed the scan in the vent?

2771
02:15:32,010 --> 02:15:32,470
It's alright.

2772
02:15:36,340 --> 02:15:38,180
I cannot deal with mazes.

2773
02:15:39,920 --> 02:15:43,120
A rat catcher needs more than just his charm to lead.

2774
02:15:43,540 --> 02:15:45,200
Oh, it's the Pied Piper!

2775
02:15:48,420 --> 02:15:50,180
I need to scan some rats?

2776
02:15:52,380 --> 02:15:53,520
Where are the rats?

2777
02:15:56,840 --> 02:15:57,480
Oof.

2778
02:15:58,180 --> 02:15:59,320
Help me!

2779
02:15:59,320 --> 02:16:00,960
What the fuck is that?

2780
02:16:01,180 --> 02:16:01,340
Oh.

2781
02:16:01,700 --> 02:16:01,700
Please.

2782
02:16:02,400 --> 02:16:02,840
Stop.

2783
02:16:03,660 --> 02:16:05,540
I told you what you wanted to know.

2784
02:16:06,540 --> 02:16:07,300
You got everyone.

2785
02:16:07,300 --> 02:16:08,000
Pulling time.

2786
02:16:08,360 --> 02:16:08,800
Please.

2787
02:16:09,720 --> 02:16:10,820
You can let me go.

2788
02:16:11,220 --> 02:16:13,740
Hey, you promise you won't tell anyone about Joker's plan?

2789
02:16:14,600 --> 02:16:15,680
Well, okay then.

2790
02:16:16,060 --> 02:16:17,480
Help this guy to his feet.

2791
02:16:17,680 --> 02:16:18,860
Then shoot him in the face!

2792
02:16:19,020 --> 02:16:22,060
Why do we always go back to Riverdale, Doki?

2793
02:16:22,320 --> 02:16:24,280
Thank you for the super chat, Alan.

2794
02:16:24,360 --> 02:16:25,220
Thank you, thank you.

2795
02:16:25,520 --> 02:16:27,820
Did you think we'd just let you walk out of here?

2796
02:16:27,820 --> 02:16:29,620
He doesn't even have guns.

2797
02:16:29,720 --> 02:16:30,420
How do you do shoot?

2798
02:16:30,780 --> 02:16:31,100
It's funny.

2799
02:16:31,180 --> 02:16:31,660
Listen up.

2800
02:16:31,900 --> 02:16:33,520
I'm gonna kick you a bit more.

2801
02:16:33,680 --> 02:16:37,420
Then when you pass out, I'll drag you back in there and throw you down the hall.

2802
02:16:37,660 --> 02:16:39,000
Let all your friends watch.

2803
02:16:39,140 --> 02:16:39,340
Yeah.

2804
02:16:40,840 --> 02:16:42,140
I could stop this at...

2805
02:16:42,140 --> 02:16:42,300
Oh!

2806
02:16:43,060 --> 02:16:46,800
I could have stopped this at any time, but I had to stay there for lore.

2807
02:16:47,100 --> 02:16:49,000
How fucked up are you, Doki?

2808
02:16:51,800 --> 02:16:52,580
I'm sorry!

2809
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:56,240
I could have saved you earlier, but the lore was more important.

2810
02:16:56,840 --> 02:16:57,520
I'm sorry.

2811
02:17:00,960 --> 02:17:01,580
I'm sorry.

2812
02:17:01,580 --> 02:17:03,920
I hate it when they interrupt my fucking finishers.

2813
02:17:05,420 --> 02:17:06,600
I'm so sorry, man.

2814
02:17:06,680 --> 02:17:07,800
The lore was just too good.

2815
02:17:13,280 --> 02:17:14,280
Hey, are you okay?

2816
02:17:14,560 --> 02:17:16,200
Sorry for giving you extra trauma.

2817
02:17:19,800 --> 02:17:20,640
Are you okay?

2818
02:17:21,220 --> 02:17:22,640
Do I look okay?

2819
02:17:23,220 --> 02:17:24,460
They were gonna kill me.

2820
02:17:24,980 --> 02:17:25,800
We were in the...

2821
02:17:25,800 --> 02:17:26,660
Yeah, I just got there.

2822
02:17:26,720 --> 02:17:27,020
Sorry.

2823
02:17:27,280 --> 02:17:29,720
And they came in with jokers shooting up the place.

2824
02:17:29,740 --> 02:17:30,680
I literally just got there.

2825
02:17:30,860 --> 02:17:31,460
And they left us in the cages.

2826
02:17:39,180 --> 02:17:41,900
I was not watching, I swear to God.

2827
02:17:43,300 --> 02:17:45,660
Rescue orderlies held hostage in the aviary.

2828
02:17:45,860 --> 02:17:46,540
In the aviary?

2829
02:17:46,760 --> 02:17:47,560
Where am I?

2830
02:17:48,420 --> 02:17:49,860
There's so many objectives!

2831
02:17:54,240 --> 02:17:56,600
Oh my god, there's so many things to do.

2832
02:17:57,100 --> 02:17:58,480
Why can't you do this?

2833
02:18:01,400 --> 02:18:01,760
Okay.

2834
02:18:01,760 --> 02:18:02,500
Oh hey, really?

2835
02:18:02,600 --> 02:18:03,100
Let me do this.

2836
02:18:03,220 --> 02:18:04,580
Oh, I don't have that thing again.

2837
02:18:06,660 --> 02:18:07,840
Uh... is it this way?

2838
02:18:09,660 --> 02:18:10,780
Yeah, that should be it.

2839
02:18:16,870 --> 02:18:18,170
Where are the fucking rats?

2840
02:18:55,940 --> 02:18:58,340
She's using her womanly charms against him.

2841
02:18:59,120 --> 02:19:00,320
Ducky, thank you for the super chat!

2842
02:19:00,420 --> 02:19:01,240
Thank you, thank you!

2843
02:19:01,240 --> 02:19:05,080
Clearly those grunts don't know the epic high and lows of high school!

2844
02:19:06,060 --> 02:19:08,140
I fucking love that quote.

2845
02:19:11,200 --> 02:19:11,720
Nice.

2846
02:19:12,760 --> 02:19:14,840
Is this a tribute to... oh wait, Constantine?

2847
02:19:16,480 --> 02:19:17,520
Oh, Constance.

2848
02:19:17,520 --> 02:19:18,420
Okay, never mind.

2849
02:19:23,960 --> 02:19:26,680
There's no claws in the guard so someone's using the roof instead.

2850
02:19:27,340 --> 02:19:29,320
Is that one of the orderlies?

2851
02:19:30,680 --> 02:19:32,420
Wait, how did they get them in there?

2852
02:19:32,600 --> 02:19:34,020
The bat is on the way.

2853
02:19:34,160 --> 02:19:37,220
If you see him, send the annoying doctors to help.

2854
02:19:40,860 --> 02:19:41,460
Yeah!

2855
02:19:41,900 --> 02:19:43,240
They're going down!

2856
02:19:50,900 --> 02:19:51,500
Oh.

2857
02:19:54,920 --> 02:19:57,200
If I hear what?!

2858
02:19:57,200 --> 02:19:59,980
If I hear what, Joker?!

2859
02:20:01,520 --> 02:20:03,980
What am I going to hear?!

2860
02:20:05,660 --> 02:20:06,260
Joker!

2861
02:20:06,260 --> 02:20:08,100
If I hear what?!

2862
02:20:11,260 --> 02:20:11,860
Joker!

2863
02:20:12,040 --> 02:20:12,040
If I hear what?!

2864
02:20:12,040 --> 02:20:13,100
I'll never know!

2865
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,260
I'll never know, guys!

2866
02:20:19,760 --> 02:20:21,680
Oh my god, I was too slow!

2867
02:20:21,980 --> 02:20:24,340
I'll never know what I'm going to hear!

2868
02:20:26,920 --> 02:20:27,940
My god.

2869
02:20:28,140 --> 02:20:29,800
I can't believe it.

2870
02:20:30,020 --> 02:20:31,360
That was too slow.

2871
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:33,680
Please.

2872
02:20:33,680 --> 02:20:35,040
Did it crash again?

2873
02:20:35,360 --> 02:20:36,780
Like, what?!

2874
02:20:36,780 --> 02:20:39,280
Oh my god, it crashed again!

2875
02:20:40,380 --> 02:20:40,940
Nooooo!

2876
02:20:42,380 --> 02:20:43,520
Give me a second.

2877
02:20:43,620 --> 02:20:44,260
It crashed again.

2878
02:20:44,620 --> 02:20:45,680
Let me...

2879
02:20:46,280 --> 02:20:46,780
Yeah.

2880
02:20:49,220 --> 02:20:49,780
Play.

2881
02:20:52,640 --> 02:20:53,980
Next time, man.

2882
02:20:56,660 --> 02:21:01,620
To be fair, like, this PC has been like... it's just been like Frankenstein.

2883
02:21:02,260 --> 02:21:02,820
For...

2884
02:21:04,440 --> 02:21:08,440
So maybe there has always been that one part that's fucking up my PC.

2885
02:21:08,440 --> 02:21:09,560
But I'll never know!

2886
02:21:18,670 --> 02:21:20,630
Played it recently in Mod 3 and it still crashes.

2887
02:21:20,730 --> 02:21:21,150
It's not me!

2888
02:21:21,510 --> 02:21:22,270
It's just that...

2889
02:21:22,270 --> 02:21:24,010
Okay, games that are like...

2890
02:21:24,010 --> 02:21:24,370
Uh...

2891
02:21:24,910 --> 02:21:28,170
Games that are not compatible with new stuff, to be fair.

2892
02:21:28,330 --> 02:21:29,770
Because like, you know...

2893
02:21:30,310 --> 02:21:30,830
Like...

2894
02:21:30,830 --> 02:21:35,250
They're not compatible in terms of like... the more... the more new it is.

2895
02:21:35,390 --> 02:21:39,050
Like the graphics cards are not compatible with the old shit in games.

2896
02:21:39,330 --> 02:21:39,850
Alright.

2897
02:21:40,170 --> 02:21:40,990
Y'all finally...

2898
02:21:40,990 --> 02:21:42,170
I finally know!

2899
02:21:46,130 --> 02:21:46,650
Listen.

2900
02:21:46,650 --> 02:21:48,130
The bat is on the way.

2901
02:21:48,290 --> 02:21:51,250
If you see him, send the annoying doctors to...

2902
02:21:51,250 --> 02:21:52,190
Yeah, the optimization.

2903
02:21:52,770 --> 02:21:54,150
That's the down one, right?

2904
02:21:55,550 --> 02:21:56,070
Yeah!

2905
02:21:56,070 --> 02:21:57,350
They're going down!

2906
02:22:06,410 --> 02:22:08,610
Joker's men are all wearing the security colors.

2907
02:22:09,010 --> 02:22:10,950
I'll need to take out the operator first.

2908
02:22:12,370 --> 02:22:12,890
Uh...

2909
02:22:12,890 --> 02:22:13,930
No, is this stealth?

2910
02:22:15,710 --> 02:22:16,230
No...

2911
02:22:17,670 --> 02:22:18,190
No...

2912
02:22:19,650 --> 02:22:21,150
Is this stealth?

2913
02:22:21,150 --> 02:22:21,350
No...

2914
02:22:21,970 --> 02:22:22,290
Nooooo!

2915
02:22:25,930 --> 02:22:26,250
Okay.

2916
02:22:26,510 --> 02:22:28,790
Okay, I have the sonic batteram.

2917
02:22:31,050 --> 02:22:32,490
There you go.

2918
02:22:32,610 --> 02:22:33,790
Look over... What?

2919
02:22:34,870 --> 02:22:35,190
No!

2920
02:22:36,190 --> 02:22:38,530
It could be anybody's batteram!

2921
02:22:41,510 --> 02:22:44,370
It could be anybody's!

2922
02:22:44,370 --> 02:22:45,650
Why would it be me?

2923
02:22:51,150 --> 02:22:51,470
Guys!

2924
02:22:51,470 --> 02:22:52,890
It could be anybody!

2925
02:22:53,510 --> 02:22:55,570
I don't under... How did he know?

2926
02:22:56,830 --> 02:22:58,290
How did he know?

2927
02:22:59,070 --> 02:23:00,110
He's just a man wearing the security colors.

2928
02:23:00,950 --> 02:23:02,170
I'll need to take out the operator first.

2929
02:23:02,170 --> 02:23:03,910
It could be Robin's!

2930
02:23:04,290 --> 02:23:04,850
Like...

2931
02:23:04,850 --> 02:23:06,910
How did he know it's mine?

2932
02:23:07,230 --> 02:23:08,530
I don't understand.

2933
02:23:11,450 --> 02:23:13,890
It literally could have been anybody's.

2934
02:23:13,890 --> 02:23:14,770
That's all I'm gonna say.

2935
02:23:15,450 --> 02:23:16,110
Who else?

2936
02:23:16,230 --> 02:23:16,850
I don't know!

2937
02:23:16,990 --> 02:23:18,290
Other bat enthusiasts!

2938
02:23:19,770 --> 02:23:22,050
Why did Junker crash the game?

2939
02:23:22,150 --> 02:23:23,130
Is he stupid?

2940
02:23:23,450 --> 02:23:25,790
Thank you for the super chat.

2941
02:23:25,870 --> 02:23:26,430
Thank you.

2942
02:23:26,430 --> 02:23:27,090
Thank you.

2943
02:23:29,510 --> 02:23:31,850
It could have been a Batman fan!

2944
02:23:32,110 --> 02:23:32,790
You know?

2945
02:23:33,830 --> 02:23:34,510
Okay.

2946
02:23:34,810 --> 02:23:35,490
Alright.

2947
02:23:36,450 --> 02:23:37,670
It's capitalism.

2948
02:23:38,130 --> 02:23:43,390
Someone... They must have sold, like, bootleg Batman batterams.

2949
02:23:43,610 --> 02:23:44,290
Alright?

2950
02:23:44,410 --> 02:23:47,410
Like, someone has merchandised Batman.

2951
02:23:47,410 --> 02:23:52,410
I bet you Bruce Wayne has, like, trademarked Batman.

2952
02:24:00,510 --> 02:24:06,910
There's no fucking way batterams are not, like, a trademark item where people fucking sell it.

2953
02:24:07,010 --> 02:24:08,550
There's no fucking way.

2954
02:24:08,990 --> 02:24:09,710
No.

2955
02:24:18,520 --> 02:24:20,500
I don't know how that worked, but okay.

2956
02:24:21,280 --> 02:24:22,460
Yes, but no!

2957
02:24:28,390 --> 02:24:29,790
There's no fucking way!

2958
02:24:29,910 --> 02:24:32,230
He does not have Batman trademarked.

2959
02:24:33,010 --> 02:24:34,670
Pretend this is a metal kit.

2960
02:24:35,070 --> 02:24:35,510
Right?

2961
02:24:35,610 --> 02:24:36,730
Thank you for the super chat.

2962
02:24:36,830 --> 02:24:37,250
Thank you.

2963
02:24:37,290 --> 02:24:37,870
Thank you.

2964
02:24:38,210 --> 02:24:40,150
There has to be Batman merch!

2965
02:24:40,350 --> 02:24:41,870
It's fucking capitalism!

2966
02:24:42,510 --> 02:24:45,790
Why would they not fucking capitalize on Batman?

2967
02:24:45,790 --> 02:24:51,940
I bet you Batman is somebody's Oshii!

2968
02:24:55,060 --> 02:24:56,180
Wait,

2969
02:25:02,070 --> 02:25:03,870
how the fuck do I do this?

2970
02:25:06,330 --> 02:25:09,010
Can I kill him?

2971
02:25:10,790 --> 02:25:11,910
Okay.

2972
02:25:14,270 --> 02:25:14,830
No!

2973
02:25:15,890 --> 02:25:17,010
No!

2974
02:25:20,250 --> 02:25:22,870
I can't believe it!

2975
02:25:22,970 --> 02:25:24,290
I'm so close!

2976
02:25:27,510 --> 02:25:28,570
How?!

2977
02:25:30,710 --> 02:25:34,330
Oh my god, how?!

2978
02:25:34,330 --> 02:25:37,630
I'm so fucking sad.

2979
02:25:39,080 --> 02:25:40,490
I'm so sad.

2980
02:25:41,030 --> 02:25:43,310
I was doing so well!

2981
02:25:44,030 --> 02:25:46,010
He saw my hands!

2982
02:25:46,010 --> 02:25:46,890
I don't understand!

2983
02:25:49,290 --> 02:25:53,250
Kaz, Bruce Wayne having Batman trademarked would be a little bit sussy.

2984
02:25:53,310 --> 02:25:54,570
Thank you for the super chat.

2985
02:25:54,710 --> 02:25:55,170
Thank you.

2986
02:25:55,190 --> 02:25:55,830
Thank you.

2987
02:25:55,890 --> 02:25:58,050
That's why he has so many Robins!

2988
02:25:58,150 --> 02:25:58,710
Exactly!

2989
02:25:59,730 --> 02:26:02,050
Limited edition new Robin merch!

2990
02:26:02,630 --> 02:26:03,830
Oh my god.

2991
02:26:04,250 --> 02:26:06,450
Bro, it makes so much more sense!

2992
02:26:11,030 --> 02:26:12,310
I am Kaz.

2993
02:26:12,410 --> 02:26:13,690
Thank you for the super chat.

2994
02:26:13,810 --> 02:26:14,310
Thank you.

2995
02:26:14,310 --> 02:26:15,010
Thank you.

2996
02:26:15,910 --> 02:26:17,390
It makes sense!

2997
02:26:30,840 --> 02:26:30,960
Robin!

2998
02:26:32,480 --> 02:26:34,120
New Robin debut!

2999
02:26:34,880 --> 02:26:36,140
Oh my god!

3000
02:26:36,220 --> 02:26:37,000
Robin debut!

3001
02:26:38,640 --> 02:26:39,720
Help me!

3002
02:26:40,020 --> 02:26:40,640
Someone!

3003
02:26:40,940 --> 02:26:42,220
Get me out of this thing!

3004
02:26:42,480 --> 02:26:42,820
Yeah.

3005
02:26:43,900 --> 02:26:46,460
Okay, Jason was not making enough money.

3006
02:26:46,560 --> 02:26:48,700
So they had to graduate him.

3007
02:26:51,040 --> 02:26:53,340
But then it was a publicity stunt.

3008
02:26:53,520 --> 02:26:55,600
So it boosted Jason's number.

3009
02:26:55,920 --> 02:26:57,920
It boosted Jason's number.

3010
02:26:58,120 --> 02:27:00,760
By gra- And then like they brought him back.

3011
02:27:01,200 --> 02:27:02,840
They ungraduated him.

3012
02:27:09,920 --> 02:27:10,960
It's so smart!

3013
02:27:11,180 --> 02:27:12,600
Bruce is so fucking smart!

3014
02:27:13,760 --> 02:27:14,680
Oh my god!

3015
02:27:14,720 --> 02:27:15,920
This is how he became a billionaire!

3016
02:27:16,280 --> 02:27:18,680
This is exactly how merchandising...

3017
02:27:19,840 --> 02:27:20,320
Merchandising...

3018
02:27:23,220 --> 02:27:26,360
Batman merchandising is the most lucrative like...

3019
02:27:27,900 --> 02:27:30,720
It's the most lucrative way to earn money from him.

3020
02:27:33,720 --> 02:27:35,800
Wait, scan the guy on the wall.

3021
02:27:35,940 --> 02:27:36,560
There's a guy?

3022
02:27:49,190 --> 02:27:51,130
Yeah, but tech is like a side thing.

3023
02:27:51,270 --> 02:27:52,330
It's the side gear.

3024
02:27:52,910 --> 02:27:53,790
Oh, this guy?

3025
02:27:59,910 --> 02:28:01,690
Killer Mo- That's the Killer Moth?

3026
02:28:06,190 --> 02:28:10,330
Walker was a minor criminal who adopted the identity of Cameron Van Cleer.

3027
02:28:10,370 --> 02:28:15,470
A bastard criminal who in turn masqueraded as the costumed super villain Killer Moth.

3028
02:28:15,650 --> 02:28:18,050
He is a hired gun for Gotham City.

3029
02:28:18,050 --> 02:28:19,030
Oh my god.

3030
02:28:19,510 --> 02:28:21,070
That looks fucking stupid.

3031
02:28:21,770 --> 02:28:24,530
But he's- And he used a weapon including his Cancun gun.

3032
02:28:24,610 --> 02:28:27,330
Does not protect him from regular defeat at the hands of Batman.

3033
02:28:27,630 --> 02:28:29,250
Who the fuck would hire this guy?

3034
02:28:31,170 --> 02:28:32,970
With the fame and identity chance.

3035
02:28:33,070 --> 02:28:33,910
Skilled inventor.

3036
02:28:35,210 --> 02:28:37,270
Immoral and motivated by feelings of insecurity.

3037
02:28:37,550 --> 02:28:38,450
Oh shit, I'm sorry.

3038
02:28:38,530 --> 02:28:39,130
I didn't mean that.

3039
02:28:43,290 --> 02:28:44,470
I'm sorry man.

3040
02:28:44,530 --> 02:28:45,570
I didn't mean that.

3041
02:28:49,970 --> 02:28:51,270
I'm sorry bro.

3042
02:28:51,570 --> 02:28:54,370
I was- No, no, please.

3043
02:28:54,510 --> 02:28:55,990
I don't want to fuck it up again.

3044
02:29:04,910 --> 02:29:06,390
Okay, I can do this.

3045
02:29:07,070 --> 02:29:08,390
I can do this guys.

3046
02:29:09,670 --> 02:29:11,250
You mad here Mothman!

3047
02:29:11,590 --> 02:29:12,690
You mad here!

3048
02:29:14,410 --> 02:29:16,890
Why did I fucking- Who told me to do the takedown?

3049
02:29:20,920 --> 02:29:25,540
Alright, I listened to the one guy that was like, you should do the takedown.

3050
02:29:25,600 --> 02:29:27,640
And I was like, I should do the takedown.

3051
02:29:27,640 --> 02:29:29,380
I'm one!

3052
02:29:29,640 --> 02:29:30,560
Get me out of here!

3053
02:29:34,380 --> 02:29:35,500
God damn it.

3054
02:29:35,560 --> 02:29:36,520
I need to take out the operator first.

3055
02:29:36,740 --> 02:29:37,860
God damn it.

3056
02:29:37,860 --> 02:29:38,720
I got one guy.

3057
02:29:38,920 --> 02:29:39,760
It was me!

3058
02:29:40,580 --> 02:29:41,560
Fuck you!

3059
02:29:43,740 --> 02:29:46,740
I saw someone that was like, do the silent takedown.

3060
02:29:46,840 --> 02:29:47,920
It'll be so funny.

3061
02:29:49,860 --> 02:29:51,700
I was like, whoa, really?

3062
02:29:52,080 --> 02:29:54,040
Would it actually be that funny?

3063
02:29:54,820 --> 02:29:55,420
Alright.

3064
02:29:55,760 --> 02:29:56,900
How the fuck?

3065
02:29:58,320 --> 02:29:59,720
Please get me out of here.

3066
02:30:00,480 --> 02:30:00,980
Please.

3067
02:30:01,080 --> 02:30:02,440
It was me, Barry!

3068
02:30:04,620 --> 02:30:06,940
God, just let these janitors die!

3069
02:30:07,440 --> 02:30:08,920
I don't care anymore!

3070
02:30:10,240 --> 02:30:11,620
Bab I should get two!

3071
02:30:12,100 --> 02:30:13,440
Chica should get at least two!

3072
02:30:22,120 --> 02:30:24,900
All I'm saying is that I should get at least two.

3073
02:30:28,180 --> 02:30:28,680
Okay, I'm gonna run.

3074
02:30:35,980 --> 02:30:36,860
Okay, I'm gonna run.

3075
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:37,220
Alright.

3076
02:30:38,240 --> 02:30:39,600
Wait, do I have to scan it again?

3077
02:30:39,780 --> 02:30:41,560
Do I have to scan this fucker again?

3078
02:30:42,200 --> 02:30:44,460
I'll scan him later when I kill them all!

3079
02:30:47,560 --> 02:30:49,760
I'm gonna do that little thing I did earlier.

3080
02:31:03,640 --> 02:31:04,620
There we go.

3081
02:31:05,460 --> 02:31:06,140
There we go.

3082
02:31:07,140 --> 02:31:07,940
I did it.

3083
02:31:08,920 --> 02:31:10,180
I fucking did it.

3084
02:31:13,720 --> 02:31:14,280
I did it.

3085
02:31:14,280 --> 02:31:15,620
Take down the henchmen.

3086
02:31:15,760 --> 02:31:16,120
What?

3087
02:31:16,220 --> 02:31:16,660
Take down?

3088
02:31:16,800 --> 02:31:17,280
Oh, I did it.

3089
02:31:19,780 --> 02:31:20,460
I did it.

3090
02:31:23,060 --> 02:31:24,980
Now pull the lever, you're right.

3091
02:31:30,050 --> 02:31:30,830
First try!

3092
02:31:34,670 --> 02:31:35,110
Okay.

3093
02:31:36,410 --> 02:31:38,190
Now I can scan him.

3094
02:31:46,860 --> 02:31:48,220
But is that what they want?

3095
02:31:48,380 --> 02:31:49,180
They get to be strong.

3096
02:31:49,280 --> 02:31:49,520
I'm gonna try to get him.

3097
02:31:52,060 --> 02:31:52,500
Okay.

3098
02:31:52,520 --> 02:31:53,220
Oh, hey.

3099
02:31:53,320 --> 02:31:53,740
Hey there.

3100
02:31:53,860 --> 02:31:55,000
I didn't even see you.

3101
02:31:59,380 --> 02:32:00,740
Alright, where's the... where is he?

3102
02:32:01,860 --> 02:32:03,140
Let me scan him again.

3103
02:32:04,140 --> 02:32:05,740
Let me scan him first!

3104
02:32:05,820 --> 02:32:06,500
Don't come over!

3105
02:32:08,360 --> 02:32:09,420
Oh shit, okay!

3106
02:32:10,200 --> 02:32:10,920
Get over here.

3107
02:32:11,560 --> 02:32:12,800
Oh wait, that's the last guy.

3108
02:32:12,960 --> 02:32:13,280
Oh!

3109
02:32:14,020 --> 02:32:14,460
Fuck!

3110
02:32:16,480 --> 02:32:16,920
Nice.

3111
02:32:16,920 --> 02:32:17,620
I did it.

3112
02:32:23,590 --> 02:32:24,890
Bro, thank you for the super chat.

3113
02:32:24,890 --> 02:32:25,630
Thank you, thank you.

3114
02:32:25,690 --> 02:32:28,110
I feel like Jason graduated being big in the Indies.

3115
02:32:28,130 --> 02:32:29,450
But I'm loving the stream, Doki.

3116
02:32:29,530 --> 02:32:31,490
Yeah, but he crawled back to Batman.

3117
02:32:39,980 --> 02:32:40,420
Alright,

3118
02:32:45,940 --> 02:32:46,680
cut it over here.

3119
02:32:46,880 --> 02:32:48,140
I saved your life, we're gonna say.

3120
02:32:50,420 --> 02:32:51,500
Say thank you!

3121
02:32:57,220 --> 02:32:59,920
I had no idea Joker was involved until he burst in the lab.

3122
02:33:00,660 --> 02:33:01,860
Where is the lab?

3123
02:33:02,320 --> 02:33:03,260
Back over there.

3124
02:33:03,360 --> 02:33:04,600
I always get buzzed through.

3125
02:33:05,120 --> 02:33:07,880
There's a hidden door, but... well, you know, it's hidden.

3126
02:33:08,300 --> 02:33:09,180
I'll find it.

3127
02:33:09,320 --> 02:33:10,040
Stay here.

3128
02:33:11,400 --> 02:33:12,360
Alright, let's go.

3129
02:33:19,450 --> 02:33:20,150
Wait, yes!

3130
02:33:20,230 --> 02:33:21,370
He does have a wife!

3131
02:33:23,810 --> 02:33:25,430
He does have a wife.

3132
02:33:26,610 --> 02:33:28,510
All the robins eventually come back.

3133
02:33:29,670 --> 02:33:31,390
The merchandising is just too good.

3134
02:33:32,330 --> 02:33:33,110
The branding.

3135
02:33:45,730 --> 02:33:47,750
It's almost like Nightwing...

3136
02:33:47,750 --> 02:33:49,370
Nightwing had a good...

3137
02:33:49,370 --> 02:33:52,030
Nightwing becomes Batman later!

3138
02:33:52,590 --> 02:33:54,110
He's part of the problem.

3139
02:33:57,690 --> 02:34:01,850
He doesn't have a solo career because he ends up becoming Batman.

3140
02:34:04,150 --> 02:34:05,690
It's all connected.

3141
02:34:08,010 --> 02:34:10,310
There we go.

3142
02:34:15,530 --> 02:34:16,530
Did I go the other way?

3143
02:34:16,830 --> 02:34:18,010
Oh yeah, I guess so.

3144
02:34:18,550 --> 02:34:19,070
Right?

3145
02:34:19,130 --> 02:34:19,890
The other door, right?

3146
02:34:23,550 --> 02:34:25,550
Batman is just too good of a branding!

3147
02:34:25,910 --> 02:34:27,770
The capitalism is just too good!

3148
02:34:28,490 --> 02:34:31,050
Just think about the merchandising!

3149
02:34:39,250 --> 02:34:40,290
Getting Termina?

3150
02:34:41,390 --> 02:34:42,530
Oh, don't leave?

3151
02:34:42,790 --> 02:34:43,010
Okay.

3152
02:34:43,070 --> 02:34:45,530
Don't say that about my Oshii!

3153
02:34:51,850 --> 02:34:53,030
Where's the hidden terminal?

3154
02:34:53,250 --> 02:34:53,490
Where?

3155
02:34:53,690 --> 02:34:54,350
Oh, there it is!

3156
02:34:54,430 --> 02:34:54,870
I see it!

3157
02:34:56,550 --> 02:34:56,950
Please.

3158
02:34:58,690 --> 02:34:59,090
Please.

3159
02:34:59,450 --> 02:35:00,670
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

3160
02:35:01,970 --> 02:35:02,530
I'm good.

3161
02:35:03,010 --> 02:35:04,510
Sorry, I sort of ran...

3162
02:35:04,510 --> 02:35:05,130
Sorry.

3163
02:35:09,590 --> 02:35:10,390
The wall...

3164
02:35:13,560 --> 02:35:14,780
There's a vent over there.

3165
02:35:15,640 --> 02:35:16,840
How do I get to that vent?

3166
02:35:24,630 --> 02:35:25,470
Oh, it's this way.

3167
02:35:25,570 --> 02:35:25,970
Okay.

3168
02:35:26,750 --> 02:35:27,550
Oh, there it is!

3169
02:35:33,490 --> 02:35:33,890
Okay.

3170
02:35:33,970 --> 02:35:34,630
Oh, I can open it.

3171
02:35:34,650 --> 02:35:36,610
I was gonna say I should use my backlaw or not.

3172
02:35:40,120 --> 02:35:42,560
I bet you Superman isn't even a farmer's boy.

3173
02:35:42,680 --> 02:35:43,460
It's just all PR.

3174
02:35:48,460 --> 02:35:51,060
I bet you Clark Kent isn't a farm boy!

3175
02:35:51,620 --> 02:35:52,700
What the fuck is that?

3176
02:36:04,400 --> 02:36:05,000
Oh, no!

3177
02:36:05,200 --> 02:36:06,260
Don't say that!

3178
02:36:08,900 --> 02:36:09,880
You can't do that!

3179
02:36:16,060 --> 02:36:16,340
Wait, what?

3180
02:36:17,400 --> 02:36:18,520
I'm just back here.

3181
02:36:19,980 --> 02:36:21,160
Wait, I could've done that.

3182
02:36:22,140 --> 02:36:24,060
I could've just done this?!

3183
02:36:26,760 --> 02:36:28,820
Wait, this... this was... actually, no.

3184
02:36:28,860 --> 02:36:29,820
This was more complicated.

3185
02:36:33,380 --> 02:36:36,100
This was actually more complicated, not gonna lie.

3186
02:36:36,280 --> 02:36:37,360
Where the fuck is this statue?

3187
02:36:39,360 --> 02:36:40,420
Follow the fingerprints.

3188
02:36:40,760 --> 02:36:41,000
Okay.

3189
02:36:41,160 --> 02:36:42,380
Let me find the fingerprints.

3190
02:36:42,380 --> 02:36:45,160
That was the intended way.

3191
02:36:45,240 --> 02:36:46,920
I made it much more difficult.

3192
02:36:47,740 --> 02:36:49,760
I ran past the secret tunnel.

3193
02:36:50,100 --> 02:36:52,540
Look, I fucking gained so hard.

3194
02:36:52,800 --> 02:36:53,500
Like, come on.

3195
02:36:54,660 --> 02:36:57,600
What I did was cooler.

3196
02:36:57,920 --> 02:36:59,900
I'm not gonna lie.

3197
02:37:07,420 --> 02:37:08,820
I could've went up!

3198
02:37:09,720 --> 02:37:12,520
Oh my god, I could've went so many different other ways.

3199
02:37:15,180 --> 02:37:16,220
Oh, there it is.

3200
02:37:23,520 --> 02:37:23,960
Okay.

3201
02:37:25,900 --> 02:37:27,860
Time to do the Joker gas.

3202
02:37:31,690 --> 02:37:32,130
Yay!

3203
02:37:39,440 --> 02:37:40,080
There we go.

3204
02:37:40,620 --> 02:37:41,060
Yay!

3205
02:37:54,630 --> 02:37:55,230
Where's that?

3206
02:37:56,530 --> 02:37:57,410
Oh, there it is.

3207
02:37:57,530 --> 02:37:59,570
Oh, thank god it's next to me, because I would never find it.

3208
02:38:00,050 --> 02:38:01,110
Thank fucking god.

3209
02:38:02,450 --> 02:38:02,890
Joker!

3210
02:38:15,520 --> 02:38:16,860
He's gonna do it!

3211
02:38:19,120 --> 02:38:20,800
They're gonna go Bane!

3212
02:38:21,220 --> 02:38:22,160
He's Bane-ing out!

3213
02:38:29,140 --> 02:38:30,960
Never go full Bane.

3214
02:38:32,140 --> 02:38:33,240
Oh, oh!

3215
02:38:33,340 --> 02:38:34,620
Oh god!

3216
02:38:35,100 --> 02:38:35,700
Oh!

3217
02:38:35,700 --> 02:38:35,860
Ugh!

3218
02:38:44,140 --> 02:38:46,320
I like how his- their pants are okay.

3219
02:38:48,100 --> 02:38:49,340
Oh fuck!

3220
02:38:49,480 --> 02:38:50,040
I forgot!

3221
02:38:54,980 --> 02:38:55,600
Wow!

3222
02:38:55,880 --> 02:38:56,800
What the fuck!

3223
02:38:56,980 --> 02:38:58,580
I can't- I got charged at!

3224
02:39:00,680 --> 02:39:02,060
Okay, that's bullshit.

3225
02:39:02,740 --> 02:39:04,560
That is so bullshit.

3226
02:39:05,460 --> 02:39:06,080
Alright.

3227
02:39:07,700 --> 02:39:08,740
Oh shit.

3228
02:39:09,120 --> 02:39:10,000
Oh fuck!

3229
02:39:12,160 --> 02:39:13,400
What is he doing?

3230
02:39:14,200 --> 02:39:14,840
Ow.

3231
02:39:18,870 --> 02:39:20,210
That is okay!

3232
02:39:20,690 --> 02:39:22,970
That is actually bullshit though.

3233
02:39:23,370 --> 02:39:25,650
That is actually bullshit.

3234
02:39:27,030 --> 02:39:28,110
Alright, here we go.

3235
02:39:28,270 --> 02:39:28,650
There's two.

3236
02:39:28,970 --> 02:39:30,150
How the fuck- no!

3237
02:39:30,910 --> 02:39:32,610
This is much worse!

3238
02:39:33,550 --> 02:39:33,810
No!

3239
02:39:41,010 --> 02:39:41,650
Okay.

3240
02:39:41,770 --> 02:39:42,190
There we go.

3241
02:39:42,610 --> 02:39:44,950
I can hit both of them at the same time.

3242
02:39:45,670 --> 02:39:46,310
Okay.

3243
02:39:46,310 --> 02:39:46,310
There we go.

3244
02:39:47,570 --> 02:39:48,530
That's fucking right.

3245
02:39:49,010 --> 02:39:49,410
No!

3246
02:39:50,130 --> 02:39:52,670
He's a- I need to get this guy too!

3247
02:39:54,190 --> 02:39:55,050
What do I do?

3248
02:39:55,330 --> 02:39:55,590
Oh!

3249
02:39:55,670 --> 02:39:56,470
I just didn't hit him!

3250
02:39:56,550 --> 02:39:56,810
Okay!

3251
02:39:59,490 --> 02:40:01,770
I'm just like, what do I do?

3252
02:40:02,890 --> 02:40:03,690
Get him too!

3253
02:40:03,990 --> 02:40:04,510
That's right!

3254
02:40:04,570 --> 02:40:05,350
Stop hitting yourself!

3255
02:40:07,070 --> 02:40:08,130
Stop hitting yourself!

3256
02:40:10,290 --> 02:40:11,410
Are you guys stupid?

3257
02:40:11,610 --> 02:40:12,210
Oh shit.

3258
02:40:12,330 --> 02:40:13,010
I didn't mean that.

3259
02:40:13,370 --> 02:40:14,290
I didn't mean that.

3260
02:40:14,290 --> 02:40:14,810
I didn't mean that.

3261
02:40:14,830 --> 02:40:15,350
I'm so sorry.

3262
02:40:15,350 --> 02:40:16,510
I did not mean that.

3263
02:40:16,630 --> 02:40:16,810
I did not mean that.

3264
02:40:17,710 --> 02:40:17,770
I did not mean that.

3265
02:40:18,630 --> 02:40:19,050
Oh!

3266
02:40:22,550 --> 02:40:24,050
Oh my god, they're picking up people.

3267
02:40:24,310 --> 02:40:25,070
Oh fuck!

3268
02:40:28,150 --> 02:40:28,570
Okay.

3269
02:40:30,530 --> 02:40:32,150
Okay, I need to get out of there.

3270
02:40:33,110 --> 02:40:33,530
Okay.

3271
02:40:34,350 --> 02:40:34,890
Get on!

3272
02:40:35,350 --> 02:40:36,030
Piggyback time!

3273
02:40:36,170 --> 02:40:36,910
It's piggyback time!

3274
02:40:38,330 --> 02:40:39,090
Get over here!

3275
02:40:39,990 --> 02:40:41,130
We gotta hit each other!

3276
02:40:43,650 --> 02:40:44,850
It's the only way!

3277
02:40:46,710 --> 02:40:48,250
They're tossing people!

3278
02:40:48,490 --> 02:40:48,990
That's illegal!

3279
02:40:49,430 --> 02:40:50,530
Why are they tossing people?

3280
02:40:51,090 --> 02:40:52,810
Why can't I toss people?

3281
02:40:52,990 --> 02:40:53,970
I should be strong enough!

3282
02:40:58,630 --> 02:40:59,190
Guys...

3283
02:41:00,430 --> 02:41:04,670
Holy f- I like how he can hit his teammates too with that.

3284
02:41:04,910 --> 02:41:06,210
That's actually pretty funny.

3285
02:41:06,210 --> 02:41:07,030
Hehehehehe.

3286
02:41:09,290 --> 02:41:10,330
Charge meeeeee!

3287
02:41:11,990 --> 02:41:12,510
What?

3288
02:41:12,710 --> 02:41:13,650
You're too far!

3289
02:41:13,650 --> 02:41:14,310
Can you get closer?

3290
02:41:14,450 --> 02:41:15,130
You're too far!

3291
02:41:16,390 --> 02:41:16,910
Nice.

3292
02:41:21,530 --> 02:41:22,050
Alright.

3293
02:41:22,170 --> 02:41:23,290
Charge, charge, charge, charge!

3294
02:41:24,150 --> 02:41:24,670
Nice.

3295
02:41:26,450 --> 02:41:27,450
Wait, did he...

3296
02:41:28,410 --> 02:41:29,610
Is he gonna die now?

3297
02:41:30,690 --> 02:41:31,210
Okay.

3298
02:41:31,590 --> 02:41:32,430
Almost there.

3299
02:41:33,790 --> 02:41:34,570
Oh fuck!

3300
02:41:34,770 --> 02:41:35,790
Oh nice, I dodged.

3301
02:41:36,190 --> 02:41:37,150
Fucking dodged.

3302
02:41:37,150 --> 02:41:37,350
Oh!

3303
02:41:42,270 --> 02:41:42,750
Nice.

3304
02:41:44,670 --> 02:41:45,150
Okay.

3305
02:41:45,330 --> 02:41:46,090
One down.

3306
02:41:49,830 --> 02:41:50,610
One down.

3307
02:41:51,630 --> 02:41:54,110
Wait, can I just like... poke him and he'll die?

3308
02:41:55,290 --> 02:41:56,010
Oh nice.

3309
02:41:56,170 --> 02:41:56,550
Yeah, I can.

3310
02:42:01,410 --> 02:42:01,890
Please.

3311
02:42:01,890 --> 02:42:02,370
Please.

3312
02:42:02,870 --> 02:42:04,350
Please let me pick you up!

3313
02:42:06,690 --> 02:42:08,790
You wouldn't let me pick him up!

3314
02:42:11,050 --> 02:42:11,790
Easy.

3315
02:42:27,410 --> 02:42:28,810
Easy.

3316
02:42:29,370 --> 02:42:30,070
Easy.

3317
02:42:46,820 --> 02:42:49,580
Alright, let's go this way.

3318
02:42:50,160 --> 02:42:50,480
Wait, what?

3319
02:42:51,320 --> 02:42:52,380
Need tool coming up?

3320
02:42:53,760 --> 02:42:54,560
It's time!

3321
02:42:55,440 --> 02:42:56,320
It's time!

3322
02:42:56,320 --> 02:42:57,600
It's time for that one...

3323
02:42:57,600 --> 02:42:58,780
Oh wait, upgrade time!

3324
02:43:05,040 --> 02:43:05,760
Upgrade time.

3325
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:09,480
Which... what upgrade do we get?

3326
02:43:10,520 --> 02:43:12,140
That's why Ivy's gonna help us.

3327
02:43:12,200 --> 02:43:12,860
She loves plants.

3328
02:43:13,460 --> 02:43:17,760
I'm pretty sure the plants are getting tortured right now, making that venom.

3329
02:43:20,820 --> 02:43:21,820
What do we get?

3330
02:43:22,500 --> 02:43:23,080
Health?

3331
02:43:23,240 --> 02:43:23,580
Armor?

3332
02:43:23,840 --> 02:43:24,500
Okay, armor.

3333
02:43:24,700 --> 02:43:25,060
Nice.

3334
02:43:27,920 --> 02:43:29,120
Don't worry, Ivy!

3335
02:43:31,320 --> 02:43:34,900
We're gonna commit... ecoterrorism?

3336
02:43:35,900 --> 02:43:38,800
I don't know if that is considered ecoterrorism.

3337
02:43:39,160 --> 02:43:41,040
I don't even...

3338
02:43:41,040 --> 02:43:42,820
No, because we're saving...

3339
02:43:42,860 --> 02:43:43,360
We're saving the plants!

3340
02:43:43,680 --> 02:43:45,100
No, no, we're good people.

3341
02:43:45,280 --> 02:43:46,180
Yes, we're good people.

3342
02:43:47,320 --> 02:43:48,700
We're good people this time.

3343
02:43:49,320 --> 02:43:50,760
Where the fuck is the terminal?

3344
02:43:51,360 --> 02:43:52,280
Oh, there it is.

3345
02:44:00,120 --> 02:44:01,080
How do I...

3346
02:44:02,020 --> 02:44:03,020
How do I...

3347
02:44:03,020 --> 02:44:04,260
How do I do this?

3348
02:44:05,280 --> 02:44:06,580
Where the fuck... oh, there it is.

3349
02:44:12,670 --> 02:44:13,150
How?

3350
02:44:16,610 --> 02:44:17,090
Batman?

3351
02:44:22,500 --> 02:44:23,380
What did I do?

3352
02:44:24,260 --> 02:44:24,780
Oh, my ship!

3353
02:44:30,160 --> 02:44:31,240
The Bat Ship!

3354
02:44:40,140 --> 02:44:42,040
Why didn't you give me this earlier?

3355
02:44:48,700 --> 02:44:50,200
Did I just pick this up?

3356
02:44:58,270 --> 02:44:59,770
The Line Launcher.

3357
02:45:00,330 --> 02:45:01,110
That's right!

3358
02:45:01,790 --> 02:45:04,910
I can go back and do all the stuff that needs this!

3359
02:45:05,330 --> 02:45:06,890
But I won't.

3360
02:45:11,990 --> 02:45:14,110
But I won't.

3361
02:45:14,770 --> 02:45:15,350
Yay!

3362
02:45:17,170 --> 02:45:18,750
Now I can go find Ivy.

3363
02:45:23,610 --> 02:45:24,730
Where is Ivy?

3364
02:45:28,440 --> 02:45:31,320
Locate Poison Ivy using the Thermo Trail.

3365
02:45:31,680 --> 02:45:32,780
Yeah, where is it?

3366
02:45:34,440 --> 02:45:36,780
At 25... 4%.

3367
02:45:37,860 --> 02:45:41,660
I guess like... oh, the closer I get, the higher percentage.

3368
02:45:41,940 --> 02:45:42,340
You're all dead.

3369
02:45:42,900 --> 02:45:45,080
Joker was busy while I fought his monsters.

3370
02:45:45,460 --> 02:45:46,840
He'll pay for this.

3371
02:45:47,180 --> 02:45:48,400
Let's back this way.

3372
02:45:49,080 --> 02:45:51,600
I guess I can get that one Riddler Trophy.

3373
02:45:52,260 --> 02:45:53,720
I'll give you guys a one.

3374
02:45:54,040 --> 02:45:55,860
I'll give you guys like a plus one.

3375
02:45:57,100 --> 02:45:57,780
Don't worry.

3376
02:45:58,560 --> 02:45:59,440
Where is it?

3377
02:46:00,240 --> 02:46:00,720
Here?

3378
02:46:01,160 --> 02:46:01,800
It's here!

3379
02:46:02,600 --> 02:46:03,360
Guys, see?

3380
02:46:03,900 --> 02:46:04,940
I'm a good person.

3381
02:46:05,760 --> 02:46:07,320
I gave you guys that one.

3382
02:46:18,880 --> 02:46:22,060
Only because I have to go here anyway.

3383
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:27,100
The only reason is because I have to be here.

3384
02:46:30,320 --> 02:46:31,240
Poison Ivy!

3385
02:46:31,560 --> 02:46:33,200
We're here to save your plants!

3386
02:46:33,400 --> 02:46:36,560
I'm here now, my poor darling.

3387
02:46:37,240 --> 02:46:39,820
Yes, I know he's found us.

3388
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:41,920
But I won't let him hurt you.

3389
02:46:42,560 --> 02:46:44,040
I'll kill him first.

3390
02:46:46,180 --> 02:46:49,540
I know Dr. Young mutated these plants to produce venom.

3391
02:46:49,820 --> 02:46:54,420
Yes, and I heard it through the grapevine the evil woman paid the price.

3392
02:46:56,140 --> 02:46:58,500
I need you to help me create an antidote.

3393
02:46:58,620 --> 02:46:59,660
Why should I?

3394
02:46:59,960 --> 02:47:01,700
Let Joker have his fun.

3395
02:47:02,300 --> 02:47:04,720
I'll enjoy watching you squirm.

3396
02:47:09,180 --> 02:47:10,020
I'll be back.

3397
02:47:12,620 --> 02:47:14,300
Are you still wearing a shirt?

3398
02:47:18,100 --> 02:47:21,940
I mean as if like why is she wearing her like green outfit?

3399
02:47:25,680 --> 02:47:27,400
This is lower reason.

3400
02:47:37,560 --> 02:47:40,100
I mean her fucking plant outfit!

3401
02:47:40,680 --> 02:47:42,380
I'll be after you next.

3402
02:47:43,220 --> 02:47:44,720
And I'll be waiting.

3403
02:47:45,160 --> 02:47:45,920
Is that it?

3404
02:47:46,120 --> 02:47:47,280
That's just her interaction?

3405
02:47:47,460 --> 02:47:49,100
She's just gonna give me like exposition?

3406
02:47:52,500 --> 02:47:53,560
We're not gonna do anything?

3407
02:47:53,840 --> 02:47:54,680
We're not gonna fight her?

3408
02:47:55,400 --> 02:47:56,560
She's like so important.

3409
02:47:57,120 --> 02:47:59,260
I need to find a way into Killer Croc's lair.

3410
02:47:59,480 --> 02:48:01,080
It's somewhere below Arkham Island.

3411
02:48:01,340 --> 02:48:03,300
There's nothing on the system about where he's kept.

3412
02:48:03,560 --> 02:48:06,080
I found a door near the Batcave but it's shut tight.

3413
02:48:06,840 --> 02:48:08,260
There's got to be another way in.

3414
02:48:08,880 --> 02:48:10,860
I left guard Cash in the mansion.

3415
02:48:11,200 --> 02:48:13,720
I'll see if he can shed some light on where Croc's kept.

3416
02:48:15,060 --> 02:48:16,600
Asalondis, thank you for the magenta soup.

3417
02:48:16,780 --> 02:48:17,600
Thank you, thank you.

3418
02:48:17,620 --> 02:48:18,460
Saves the bird.

3419
02:48:18,700 --> 02:48:20,660
Just let the innocent people die.

3420
02:48:20,800 --> 02:48:21,540
Okay, look.

3421
02:48:22,040 --> 02:48:22,480
Sometime...

3422
02:48:22,480 --> 02:48:23,200
Wait, what the fuck?

3423
02:48:26,040 --> 02:48:27,220
We don't have guns though.

3424
02:48:28,740 --> 02:48:29,640
Can I just do this?

3425
02:48:36,820 --> 02:48:37,760
Alright, who's next?

3426
02:48:38,420 --> 02:48:38,860
Who's next?

3427
02:48:38,860 --> 02:48:39,900
Who's next?

3428
02:48:40,600 --> 02:48:41,360
Who's next?

3429
02:48:42,240 --> 02:48:42,720
Who's next?

3430
02:48:42,720 --> 02:48:43,220
Come on!

3431
02:48:43,360 --> 02:48:44,880
You can't dodge this forever!

3432
02:48:49,780 --> 02:48:50,380
That's right!

3433
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:55,300
Alright, get over here.

3434
02:48:56,080 --> 02:48:56,560
Nice.

3435
02:48:57,400 --> 02:48:57,880
Alright.

3436
02:48:57,900 --> 02:48:58,400
You know what?

3437
02:48:58,640 --> 02:49:00,920
By the way, the eighth guy...

3438
02:49:00,920 --> 02:49:02,060
Look, they lined up too!

3439
02:49:02,740 --> 02:49:04,680
They're like, me, my turn, my turn!

3440
02:49:05,920 --> 02:49:10,220
And they're like, it's my turn!

3441
02:49:11,920 --> 02:49:13,480
Alright, next is your turn.

3442
02:49:13,940 --> 02:49:14,940
Get over here.

3443
02:49:15,220 --> 02:49:15,960
Last guy!

3444
02:49:17,940 --> 02:49:20,000
Come on, you can't dodge this forever!

3445
02:49:22,040 --> 02:49:23,720
Watch out, hold on.

3446
02:49:23,800 --> 02:49:24,660
Thank you for the super chat.

3447
02:49:24,740 --> 02:49:24,980
Thank you.

3448
02:49:25,120 --> 02:49:25,620
Thank you.

3449
02:49:26,560 --> 02:49:27,080
Mommy.

3450
02:49:27,580 --> 02:49:28,400
Look at that.

3451
02:49:28,600 --> 02:49:29,460
It's that easy.

3452
02:49:31,340 --> 02:49:31,860
Whoop!

3453
02:49:32,060 --> 02:49:32,440
She's coming.

3454
02:49:34,140 --> 02:49:34,660
She's coming.

3455
02:49:34,660 --> 02:49:37,560
They didn't put their stats on intellect, that's for sure.

3456
02:49:40,520 --> 02:49:45,160
Alright, we gotta collect plant spores from Killer Croc's lair.

3457
02:49:45,300 --> 02:49:47,040
Talk to... where the fuck is that?

3458
02:49:47,720 --> 02:49:50,020
Is that outside of Gotham?

3459
02:49:50,200 --> 02:49:52,660
Oh it is, it's at the Gotham Mansion.

3460
02:49:53,720 --> 02:49:55,420
Alright, how do I get out of here?

3461
02:49:55,460 --> 02:49:55,940
I don't remember.

3462
02:50:00,060 --> 02:50:01,020
This way?

3463
02:50:02,080 --> 02:50:02,920
Yes, this way.

3464
02:50:04,660 --> 02:50:06,120
Nice, it was that easy.

3465
02:50:08,180 --> 02:50:09,260
Where are the rats?

3466
02:50:11,100 --> 02:50:12,200
Oh, I solved it.

3467
02:50:15,040 --> 02:50:16,120
Humpty Dumpty?

3468
02:50:16,620 --> 02:50:18,580
Wait, I didn't know there's a Humpty Dumpty.

3469
02:50:19,380 --> 02:50:23,980
An obese bald man named Humpty Dumpty is for his egg-like form.

3470
02:50:24,100 --> 02:50:24,960
Humpty Dum...

3471
02:50:25,540 --> 02:50:30,280
Humphrey Dumpler is obsessed... okay, now that's just his parents being cruel.

3472
02:50:31,640 --> 02:50:34,360
Like, this is just his parents' fault.

3473
02:50:35,380 --> 02:50:40,800
Humphrey Dumpler is obsessed with taking things apart and putting them back together.

3474
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:44,240
His crimes at first were minor break-ins leading to small...

3475
02:50:44,240 --> 02:50:45,760
What the fuck you want?

3476
02:50:45,980 --> 02:50:48,560
The fuck's that fat Mario?

3477
02:50:49,180 --> 02:50:50,640
Holy shit, bro!

3478
02:50:50,760 --> 02:50:53,200
His name is already Humphrey Dumpler!

3479
02:50:53,360 --> 02:50:54,880
You don't have to do that to him!

3480
02:50:56,320 --> 02:50:58,940
You set up for failure, yeah!

3481
02:51:00,820 --> 02:51:04,380
Functioning due to Dumpler's inability adequately resemble...

3482
02:51:04,380 --> 02:51:06,340
...reassemble them after taking them apart.

3483
02:51:06,500 --> 02:51:10,680
But soon his obsession grew to the point that major disasters occurred in Gotham.

3484
02:51:10,760 --> 02:51:17,020
And Dumpler's crimes also extended into a gruesome attempt to fix his abusive grandmother by disemowing...

3485
02:51:17,020 --> 02:51:17,460
Wow!

3486
02:51:17,980 --> 02:51:21,700
And then attempting a Frankenstein-like reassembly.

3487
02:51:21,800 --> 02:51:23,800
How come he is a model inmate?

3488
02:51:23,800 --> 02:51:25,860
His quiet nature imposing physique...

3489
02:51:25,860 --> 02:51:28,360
...fearing him to the madness surrounding him.

3490
02:51:28,420 --> 02:51:30,880
Jesus, he just wants to fucking take things apart.

3491
02:51:31,560 --> 02:51:33,040
That's all he wants to do.

3492
02:51:33,160 --> 02:51:34,360
What did he fucking do?

3493
02:51:34,360 --> 02:51:35,420
Debut 2003.

3494
02:51:36,460 --> 02:51:37,220
...

3495
02:51:38,720 --> 02:51:40,100
Ritualized child...

3496
02:51:40,100 --> 02:51:40,600
Dude this...

3497
02:51:40,600 --> 02:51:41,080
...

3498
02:51:41,080 --> 02:51:44,400
Bro, this person just had a really fucking hard life.

3499
02:51:45,100 --> 02:51:46,940
His parents named him Humphrey Dumpler!

3500
02:51:47,420 --> 02:51:47,820
...

3501
02:51:51,250 --> 02:51:52,470
Bro, it's not his fault.

3502
02:51:53,010 --> 02:51:53,770
...

3503
02:51:55,920 --> 02:51:58,220
Parents literally named him Humphrey Dumpler.

3504
02:51:59,040 --> 02:51:59,800
...

3505
02:51:59,800 --> 02:52:01,260
Alright, we gotta go...

3506
02:52:01,700 --> 02:52:02,560
...

3507
02:52:03,440 --> 02:52:06,540
We gotta go into the vent apparently.

3508
02:52:06,540 --> 02:52:07,060
...

3509
02:52:07,220 --> 02:52:07,460
...

3510
02:52:07,460 --> 02:52:08,080
...

3511
02:52:08,080 --> 02:52:08,340
...

3512
02:52:08,340 --> 02:52:08,640
...Vent time.

3513
02:52:09,020 --> 02:52:09,120
...

3514
02:52:09,120 --> 02:52:10,260
We gotta find some rats.

3515
02:52:10,620 --> 02:52:11,040
...

3516
02:52:12,040 --> 02:52:13,560
We're the rat catcher.

3517
02:52:13,680 --> 02:52:14,320
...

3518
02:52:14,820 --> 02:52:15,900
No rats here!

3519
02:52:16,260 --> 02:52:16,540
...

3520
02:52:16,860 --> 02:52:18,380
Where the fucking rats?

3521
02:52:18,860 --> 02:52:19,580
...

3522
02:52:23,420 --> 02:52:25,200
Oh my god, there's no rats anywhere.

3523
02:52:25,940 --> 02:52:26,660
...

3524
02:52:27,280 --> 02:52:28,880
Look down in vent?

3525
02:52:28,980 --> 02:52:30,000
There's another vent?

3526
02:52:30,340 --> 02:52:30,800
...

3527
02:52:34,490 --> 02:52:34,850
Where?

3528
02:52:35,210 --> 02:52:35,930
...

3529
02:52:38,490 --> 02:52:39,490
It's a sewer.

3530
02:52:39,590 --> 02:52:40,630
No rats in here.

3531
02:52:41,070 --> 02:52:41,790
...

3532
02:52:42,710 --> 02:52:44,210
Scan the broken vent?

3533
02:52:44,370 --> 02:52:45,610
Is that where the rat is?

3534
02:52:46,530 --> 02:52:46,750
...

3535
02:52:48,290 --> 02:52:48,810
Liars?

3536
02:52:49,090 --> 02:52:49,530
...

3537
02:52:50,250 --> 02:52:51,750
This vent in front of me?

3538
02:52:52,490 --> 02:52:53,010
...

3539
02:52:54,670 --> 02:52:56,130
Is that a vent?

3540
02:52:57,130 --> 02:52:57,650
...

3541
02:53:01,200 --> 02:53:02,780
Alright, we'll never figure this out.

3542
02:53:02,900 --> 02:53:03,740
I gave up already.

3543
02:53:04,360 --> 02:53:04,880
...

3544
02:53:07,680 --> 02:53:08,840
I gave up.

3545
02:53:09,040 --> 02:53:09,460
...

3546
02:53:12,460 --> 02:53:14,380
We'll never figure it out.

3547
02:53:14,560 --> 02:53:15,020
...

3548
02:53:20,590 --> 02:53:21,070
...

3549
02:53:21,070 --> 02:53:23,590
Let's see, we'll just go back downstairs.

3550
02:53:24,510 --> 02:53:24,890
...

3551
02:53:25,290 --> 02:53:26,250
And then...

3552
02:53:26,730 --> 02:53:27,910
Wait, there's a person there.

3553
02:53:31,470 --> 02:53:34,290
Bro, I'm not even thinking about you right now, really?

3554
02:53:34,950 --> 02:53:35,430
...

3555
02:53:36,110 --> 02:53:38,010
I wanna kill this one guy that's underneath.

3556
02:53:38,990 --> 02:53:39,470
...

3557
02:53:40,950 --> 02:53:42,430
The rats, what?

3558
02:53:42,990 --> 02:53:43,370
...

3559
02:53:44,590 --> 02:53:46,150
Wait, this is a...

3560
02:53:46,150 --> 02:53:47,230
This is a sewer.

3561
02:53:47,410 --> 02:53:48,210
I should be coming here.

3562
02:53:48,250 --> 02:53:48,330
...

3563
02:53:48,330 --> 02:53:49,810
Oh dang, I found the trophy!

3564
02:53:54,140 --> 02:53:54,520
Nice.

3565
02:53:58,630 --> 02:54:00,170
Okay, now I don't even remember how to get out of here.

3566
02:54:01,150 --> 02:54:01,530
...

3567
02:54:03,350 --> 02:54:03,930
This way?

3568
02:54:04,370 --> 02:54:04,750
No.

3569
02:54:05,330 --> 02:54:06,010
Where am I?

3570
02:54:06,230 --> 02:54:06,610
...

3571
02:54:09,790 --> 02:54:10,450
Oh no.

3572
02:54:10,890 --> 02:54:11,110
...

3573
02:54:12,530 --> 02:54:15,430
Okay, I thought like it's the cliff is just gonna start.

3574
02:54:15,610 --> 02:54:18,030
I literally thought like it's just gonna fall on me.

3575
02:54:18,070 --> 02:54:19,870
I was like, oh fuck, I might have fucked up.

3576
02:54:20,050 --> 02:54:20,410
...

3577
02:54:20,410 --> 02:54:20,510
...

3578
02:54:21,010 --> 02:54:21,390
...

3579
02:54:21,390 --> 02:54:21,490
...

3580
02:54:22,290 --> 02:54:22,850
...

3581
02:54:23,970 --> 02:54:24,530
Alright.

3582
02:54:25,490 --> 02:54:26,550
Where the fuck?

3583
02:54:26,810 --> 02:54:27,370
Where?

3584
02:54:28,790 --> 02:54:29,690
Where am I?

3585
02:54:29,930 --> 02:54:30,350
...

3586
02:54:31,530 --> 02:54:33,050
Where the fuck am I?

3587
02:54:33,770 --> 02:54:34,970
Where's the exit?

3588
02:54:35,330 --> 02:54:35,590
...

3589
02:54:36,990 --> 02:54:37,550
Guys!

3590
02:54:40,270 --> 02:54:41,950
Okay, now that's the entrance.

3591
02:54:42,890 --> 02:54:44,410
The exit's like here.

3592
02:54:44,550 --> 02:54:45,570
Okay, I need to jump here.

3593
02:54:46,170 --> 02:54:49,130
... This must be the exit.

3594
02:54:49,830 --> 02:54:50,390
Right?

3595
02:54:52,650 --> 02:54:53,710
Yeah, okay here.

3596
02:54:56,650 --> 02:54:57,670
Not lost.

3597
02:54:58,150 --> 02:55:00,250
Not lost, guys, I figured it out.

3598
02:55:00,930 --> 02:55:02,390
... Where am I?

3599
02:55:02,950 --> 02:55:03,550
...

3600
02:55:04,370 --> 02:55:04,970
Hello?

3601
02:55:06,010 --> 02:55:07,930
Can I go back up?

3602
02:55:08,570 --> 02:55:09,170
...

3603
02:55:10,310 --> 02:55:10,910
No!

3604
02:55:11,170 --> 02:55:11,670
Okay.

3605
02:55:12,450 --> 02:55:13,810
Yeah, I can't do this.

3606
02:55:13,990 --> 02:55:14,450
Here?

3607
02:55:15,390 --> 02:55:15,990
Okay.

3608
02:55:15,990 --> 02:55:15,990
Okay.

3609
02:55:17,230 --> 02:55:19,070
And then...

3610
02:55:19,590 --> 02:55:19,990
No!

3611
02:55:35,490 --> 02:55:36,030
Oh, here.

3612
02:55:36,950 --> 02:55:37,950
Oh, I figured it out!

3613
02:55:40,830 --> 02:55:41,230
Yay!

3614
02:55:43,630 --> 02:55:46,610
Oh, it's the rat again!

3615
02:55:48,350 --> 02:55:49,930
Wait, no, I didn't figure it out.

3616
02:55:50,470 --> 02:55:51,490
Well, yeah, I figured it out!

3617
02:55:55,020 --> 02:55:56,900
Okay, we need to find the rat.

3618
02:56:00,680 --> 02:56:01,540
The rat's up here!

3619
02:56:04,080 --> 02:56:05,060
Rats, rats, rats.

3620
02:56:06,820 --> 02:56:07,380
Rats.

3621
02:56:08,740 --> 02:56:10,400
Where the fuck is the rats?

3622
02:56:12,960 --> 02:56:14,560
It's in this vent somewhere.

3623
02:56:17,920 --> 02:56:18,880
Look down?

3624
02:56:19,380 --> 02:56:20,940
Where do I look down?

3625
02:56:23,080 --> 02:56:23,640
Here!

3626
02:56:23,940 --> 02:56:24,960
Oh, there it is!

3627
02:56:27,060 --> 02:56:28,720
We did it, we beat the rats.

3628
02:56:31,040 --> 02:56:33,220
Once employed as an actual rat captain...

3629
02:56:33,240 --> 02:56:43,460
...in Gotham, Otis Flemingen soon started using his natural gift and affinity with an ability to control rats to stage a variety of crimes.

3630
02:56:43,800 --> 02:56:51,020
Eventually, his control over the vermin grew until he threatened Gotham City with a variable army of rodents.

3631
02:56:51,200 --> 02:57:03,040
Incarcerated many times at Blackgate, he is able to do as much damage within prisons without using his loyal pets to relay messages and transport materials outside the maze of ventilation ducts.

3632
02:57:03,240 --> 02:57:05,380
...and he is able to control rats that wind through the giant prison...

3633
02:57:05,380 --> 02:57:06,640
Wait, how tall is he though?

3634
02:57:06,960 --> 02:57:07,920
I put 11.

3635
02:57:11,380 --> 02:57:13,760
...and he lives in the sewer.

3636
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:14,480
Poor guy.

3637
02:57:17,080 --> 02:57:18,420
Alright you guys get to look at him.

3638
02:57:18,600 --> 02:57:19,820
I'm going to use a bat to your very back.

3639
03:00:17,890 --> 03:00:19,090
Back it for buddy!

3640
03:00:19,790 --> 03:00:20,850
Alright, let's beat them up.

3641
03:00:26,010 --> 03:00:26,450
Alright.

3642
03:00:29,150 --> 03:00:30,350
Oh, he's so trapped.

3643
03:00:31,670 --> 03:00:32,410
Oh, he's so trapped.

3644
03:00:33,110 --> 03:00:35,210
Oh no, I'm so trapped.

3645
03:00:35,530 --> 03:00:36,270
Oh no!

3646
03:00:37,110 --> 03:00:38,210
Get over here.

3647
03:00:38,670 --> 03:00:40,710
Oh no, I'm so trapped.

3648
03:00:40,830 --> 03:00:41,270
Get up!

3649
03:00:41,930 --> 03:00:42,990
Get up, bitch!

3650
03:00:43,690 --> 03:00:44,230
Come on!

3651
03:00:45,110 --> 03:00:47,510
Oh no, I'm so trapped!

3652
03:00:48,610 --> 03:00:50,950
Wait, how does he... Come on, I need to pull you in.

3653
03:00:51,310 --> 03:00:55,530
I will pull you into the water if it's the last thing I do!

3654
03:00:56,390 --> 03:00:57,730
Whoops, sorry, I couldn't aim.

3655
03:00:58,150 --> 03:01:00,530
Come on, you can't stay up there forever!

3656
03:01:01,530 --> 03:01:05,730
Oh my god, they actually programmed it so I can't electrocute them.

3657
03:01:05,810 --> 03:01:06,550
That's so fucked up.

3658
03:01:07,350 --> 03:01:08,750
That's actually so fucked up.

3659
03:01:08,790 --> 03:01:09,690
I guess I'll do this then.

3660
03:01:13,030 --> 03:01:15,850
I guess I'll do it the hard way.

3661
03:01:20,990 --> 03:01:23,850
I guess I'll do it this way.

3662
03:01:24,810 --> 03:01:28,490
Do you guys know they're planning on rebooting DC Comics again?

3663
03:01:29,090 --> 03:01:30,490
I don't even know how...

3664
03:01:30,530 --> 03:01:33,150
How many times they rebooted the fucking DC lore.

3665
03:01:37,530 --> 03:01:38,350
Again?

3666
03:01:40,370 --> 03:01:41,390
Yeah, again.

3667
03:01:43,680 --> 03:01:44,510
Alright, goodbye.

3668
03:01:46,570 --> 03:01:49,630
How many times have they rebooted DC Universe anyway?

3669
03:01:56,610 --> 03:01:58,530
Alright, let's see.

3670
03:01:58,690 --> 03:01:59,770
He's on top!

3671
03:01:59,790 --> 03:02:00,510
He's on top!

3672
03:02:00,510 --> 03:02:00,750
No!

3673
03:02:01,330 --> 03:02:02,230
No I'm not!

3674
03:02:02,510 --> 03:02:02,850
No, I'm rude!

3675
03:02:03,270 --> 03:02:04,050
We know he is.

3676
03:02:04,110 --> 03:02:04,950
No, I'm not!

3677
03:02:05,550 --> 03:02:06,990
I just got you a gift up there!

3678
03:02:07,710 --> 03:02:09,750
Wait, what did my sonic thing go?

3679
03:02:09,970 --> 03:02:10,570
You just shut that thing off.

3680
03:02:10,870 --> 03:02:12,890
I was going to say, where did it go?

3681
03:02:15,690 --> 03:02:16,130
No!

3682
03:02:17,650 --> 03:02:18,510
Come on, Libby!

3683
03:02:20,230 --> 03:02:21,010
Get down!

3684
03:02:21,070 --> 03:02:21,490
Get down!

3685
03:02:25,430 --> 03:02:26,310
Yes, there you go.

3686
03:02:26,330 --> 03:02:27,150
Silent takedown.

3687
03:02:27,330 --> 03:02:27,670
Take that off me!

3688
03:02:28,150 --> 03:02:30,630
It's been rebooted five times?!

3689
03:02:30,630 --> 03:02:32,970
I think that's one of the biggest issues.

3690
03:02:34,610 --> 03:02:35,910
One of the biggest issues.

3691
03:02:36,050 --> 03:02:39,450
It's just rebooted so many times that you don't know which is the real...

3692
03:02:39,450 --> 03:02:44,630
It gets boring because it's like... How many times are we going to watch Batman's parents die?

3693
03:02:46,590 --> 03:02:47,630
Like at that rate.

3694
03:02:48,810 --> 03:02:51,730
How many times do we watch his parents die?

3695
03:03:01,870 --> 03:03:02,610
Goodbye.

3696
03:03:07,090 --> 03:03:09,980
New new new new new new 52.

3697
03:03:14,240 --> 03:03:16,060
I swear to God.

3698
03:03:16,160 --> 03:03:18,720
If this one guy ruins it all...

3699
03:03:28,120 --> 03:03:31,180
They better not wreck on Batman's underwear.

3700
03:03:34,540 --> 03:03:35,540
I swear.

3701
03:03:35,960 --> 03:03:37,640
If they take away his underwear, I'm out.

3702
03:03:53,710 --> 03:03:55,070
You didn't do anything.

3703
03:03:57,170 --> 03:03:58,910
You didn't even do anything either.

3704
03:03:58,970 --> 03:04:00,110
You can't blame that on me.

3705
03:04:01,190 --> 03:04:02,090
What the fuck?

3706
03:04:06,310 --> 03:04:07,130
Wait, what?

3707
03:04:07,510 --> 03:04:09,430
I thought you were against this, Ivy.

3708
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:25,960
I was hoping for a 40 foot killer plan, but you don't always get what you want, do you?

3709
03:04:26,160 --> 03:04:28,100
Oh shit, is she beefed up now?

3710
03:04:28,420 --> 03:04:30,540
Is she going to be a Dommy Mommy now?

3711
03:04:33,700 --> 03:04:37,000
It's like those like... You know like those like bodybuilders?

3712
03:04:37,640 --> 03:04:41,700
Oh my gosh, the women bodybuilder competitions go so fucking hard.

3713
03:04:43,660 --> 03:04:44,720
Oh my God.

3714
03:04:45,220 --> 03:04:47,380
She's going to be like those women bodybuilders.

3715
03:04:50,770 --> 03:04:51,610
What do I go?

3716
03:04:52,190 --> 03:04:52,970
Collect plants.

3717
03:04:53,290 --> 03:04:54,450
How do I get out of here then?

3718
03:04:55,350 --> 03:04:56,190
What do I do?

3719
03:04:56,990 --> 03:04:58,590
Can I just cut it with my batter hand?

3720
03:04:58,910 --> 03:05:00,430
Maybe my fist can cut it.

3721
03:05:07,310 --> 03:05:08,090
What the fuck?

3722
03:05:08,190 --> 03:05:09,710
Where do I go then?

3723
03:05:09,970 --> 03:05:10,570
Do I go back?

3724
03:05:17,390 --> 03:05:18,030
Drop down?

3725
03:05:19,170 --> 03:05:20,030
There's a down?

3726
03:05:26,460 --> 03:05:27,640
Oh, there's a down.

3727
03:05:31,000 --> 03:05:33,300
Sorry, I forgot we're down.

3728
03:05:33,300 --> 03:05:33,960
Down is...

3729
03:05:35,340 --> 03:05:36,280
Alright, nice.

3730
03:05:36,580 --> 03:05:37,300
Go up.

3731
03:05:38,180 --> 03:05:38,980
This way.

3732
03:05:40,700 --> 03:05:41,900
Bro, I swear.

3733
03:05:42,000 --> 03:05:43,180
If she is not...

3734
03:05:43,180 --> 03:05:49,180
If she is not swole as fuck like the women bodybuilder competition, then they...

3735
03:05:49,960 --> 03:05:51,300
Then they've missed a point.

3736
03:05:51,400 --> 03:05:52,180
They've missed a mark.

3737
03:06:08,240 --> 03:06:10,680
If she's not extra hot, I'm done.

3738
03:06:14,700 --> 03:06:15,580
Oh no!

3739
03:06:16,220 --> 03:06:18,160
Wait, are they... Oh no, did they kill them?

3740
03:06:18,380 --> 03:06:19,060
Oh, thank God.

3741
03:06:19,140 --> 03:06:20,120
Okay, I was going to say.

3742
03:06:20,220 --> 03:06:21,640
I thought they were going to make them swole.

3743
03:06:25,800 --> 03:06:26,680
That is...

3744
03:06:28,040 --> 03:06:30,120
Can I just hit it?

3745
03:06:30,860 --> 03:06:33,960
Why can't I make a flame... bat a flame thrower?

3746
03:06:35,740 --> 03:06:36,940
A bat flame thrower.

3747
03:06:36,940 --> 03:06:39,080
I should be able to make a ba... Ow.

3748
03:06:39,540 --> 03:06:40,980
Oh, it doesn't hurt that much.

3749
03:06:41,020 --> 03:06:41,620
What the fuck?

3750
03:06:41,640 --> 03:06:42,760
How the fuck did these guys die?

3751
03:06:43,320 --> 03:06:45,820
I should be allowed to make a bat flame thrower.

3752
03:06:49,120 --> 03:06:50,340
Oh, I can punch it?

3753
03:06:50,480 --> 03:06:51,960
Okay, let me punch him first.

3754
03:06:53,020 --> 03:06:53,460
Okay.

3755
03:06:56,700 --> 03:06:57,140
Oh.

3756
03:06:59,280 --> 03:06:59,960
Okay, I'll...

3757
03:07:00,480 --> 03:07:03,060
I love how I can just punch the flat...

3758
03:07:03,060 --> 03:07:04,980
Just punch the plat, Batman!

3759
03:07:05,960 --> 03:07:07,200
Wait, I'll give his XP!

3760
03:07:07,200 --> 03:07:08,500
I'm going to punch all the plants.

3761
03:07:10,020 --> 03:07:10,880
I guess...

3762
03:07:10,880 --> 03:07:12,960
Fuck the environment, but in-game.

3763
03:07:14,340 --> 03:07:15,060
There we go.

3764
03:07:15,300 --> 03:07:17,360
Oh my God, they... Oh, it's just 25 XP.

3765
03:07:17,480 --> 03:07:18,440
It's not that much actually.

3766
03:07:19,600 --> 03:07:20,780
Fist the... No!

3767
03:07:23,980 --> 03:07:26,300
Batman just fist the plant.

3768
03:07:28,220 --> 03:07:28,700
Batman.

3769
03:07:30,760 --> 03:07:32,640
Why so serious, Batman?

3770
03:07:32,980 --> 03:07:34,640
Just fist the plant.

3771
03:07:37,780 --> 03:07:38,600
Oh, yeah.

3772
03:07:38,840 --> 03:07:41,200
But it adds up, Doki!

3773
03:07:41,520 --> 03:07:45,600
No, I feel like this is just some fucking... somebody's sick fetish right now.

3774
03:07:47,900 --> 03:07:48,740
Oh, shit.

3775
03:07:50,100 --> 03:07:50,420
Alright.

3776
03:07:52,620 --> 03:07:54,780
Look how it... It kills him.

3777
03:08:04,800 --> 03:08:05,440
Alright.

3778
03:08:05,440 --> 03:08:06,460
Let's see.

3779
03:08:06,880 --> 03:08:08,180
You know what I realized?

3780
03:08:08,400 --> 03:08:11,440
I found out that before, like, Disney...

3781
03:08:11,440 --> 03:08:14,260
bought Marvel and made all the fucking Disney movies.

3782
03:08:15,520 --> 03:08:17,160
Okay, I have to go this way, right?

3783
03:08:18,180 --> 03:08:22,780
The only popular characters in Marvel was like Spider-Man and...

3784
03:08:22,780 --> 03:08:27,460
was just Spider-Man and the X-Men and Wolver... I mean, Wolverine is practically a fucking X-Men.

3785
03:08:27,960 --> 03:08:31,200
And like DC basically had the fucking...

3786
03:08:31,200 --> 03:08:35,240
monopoly really for DC hero... for the hero market.

3787
03:08:40,610 --> 03:08:43,050
And now everything has to be a fucking...

3788
03:08:43,050 --> 03:08:43,410
M...

3789
03:08:43,410 --> 03:08:44,750
What is it?

3790
03:08:44,850 --> 03:08:46,430
Has to be like a...

3791
03:08:46,430 --> 03:08:47,130
a uni...

3792
03:08:47,130 --> 03:08:47,850
What's the word?

3793
03:08:47,930 --> 03:08:48,730
A cinematic universe?

3794
03:08:48,890 --> 03:08:50,730
Everything has to be a goddamn cinematic universe.

3795
03:08:51,070 --> 03:08:52,710
I'm so tired of cinematic universe.

3796
03:08:52,750 --> 03:08:53,450
Just let it end.

3797
03:08:54,450 --> 03:08:55,810
Let it end!

3798
03:08:56,910 --> 03:08:58,090
I feel like...

3799
03:08:58,090 --> 03:08:59,810
downstairs is poison.

3800
03:09:07,300 --> 03:09:07,940
Woop.

3801
03:09:08,420 --> 03:09:09,060
Whoops.

3802
03:09:13,060 --> 03:09:15,420
I'm tired of MCU's!

3803
03:09:15,540 --> 03:09:17,260
I'm tired of cinematic universes!

3804
03:09:17,260 --> 03:09:17,960
Versus...

3805
03:09:19,020 --> 03:09:20,420
Let things end!

3806
03:09:20,580 --> 03:09:22,320
Who gives a fuck about nostalgia?

3807
03:09:23,080 --> 03:09:24,120
I don't care!

3808
03:09:34,890 --> 03:09:35,850
How do I go?

3809
03:09:36,170 --> 03:09:37,010
Oh, back here.

3810
03:09:37,110 --> 03:09:37,310
Okay.

3811
03:09:40,130 --> 03:09:41,270
How do I go there?

3812
03:09:42,890 --> 03:09:44,050
Can I climb on the TV?

3813
03:09:45,690 --> 03:09:46,130
Weeeeee!

3814
03:09:47,250 --> 03:09:48,650
Guys, I can't climb on TVs.

3815
03:09:54,250 --> 03:09:55,510
Oh wait, I'm up here now.

3816
03:09:55,730 --> 03:09:56,690
How did I get up here?

3817
03:09:56,690 --> 03:09:58,090
Where am I?

3818
03:09:58,250 --> 03:10:00,670
How did I get up here?

3819
03:10:00,910 --> 03:10:01,970
What do I do?

3820
03:10:08,290 --> 03:10:08,870
Oh.

3821
03:10:09,790 --> 03:10:10,370
Balcony.

3822
03:10:10,490 --> 03:10:10,970
Okay.

3823
03:10:11,030 --> 03:10:11,630
I looked around.

3824
03:10:12,890 --> 03:10:13,470
Alright.

3825
03:10:15,050 --> 03:10:15,970
Question mark.

3826
03:10:16,810 --> 03:10:17,710
Maybe here?

3827
03:10:19,880 --> 03:10:21,110
I head across here?

3828
03:10:21,230 --> 03:10:22,030
No, that's a podium.

3829
03:10:22,170 --> 03:10:23,370
God damn it, that's a podium!

3830
03:10:23,990 --> 03:10:25,670
That's a fucking podium!

3831
03:10:28,970 --> 03:10:30,290
Where do I drop?

3832
03:10:30,290 --> 03:10:31,410
Oh, I can drop here.

3833
03:10:33,950 --> 03:10:34,750
Alright, nice.

3834
03:10:35,290 --> 03:10:36,010
Can I punch?

3835
03:10:36,130 --> 03:10:37,030
Can I fist this plat?

3836
03:10:37,250 --> 03:10:37,670
No, wait.

3837
03:10:37,750 --> 03:10:38,090
Oh, this way!

3838
03:10:40,670 --> 03:10:41,110
Okay.

3839
03:10:41,970 --> 03:10:42,990
Go up here.

3840
03:10:45,210 --> 03:10:46,830
I'm tired of nostalgia bait.

3841
03:10:47,830 --> 03:10:48,790
It's so stupid.

3842
03:10:48,830 --> 03:10:51,410
Did you guys know they released new Star Wars stuff again?

3843
03:10:52,810 --> 03:10:53,810
I'm so tired.

3844
03:10:57,690 --> 03:10:58,130
Please.

3845
03:11:01,050 --> 03:11:02,030
Where do I go?

3846
03:11:02,250 --> 03:11:02,630
Here?

3847
03:11:02,830 --> 03:11:03,550
I guess so.

3848
03:11:05,310 --> 03:11:08,190
I've lost track of how many fucking...

3849
03:11:09,290 --> 03:11:09,770
Uh...

3850
03:11:10,090 --> 03:11:10,830
What the fuck?

3851
03:11:11,210 --> 03:11:14,490
I lost track of how many fucking Star Wars shit they've made already.

3852
03:11:16,190 --> 03:11:16,950
Maybe here?

3853
03:11:18,830 --> 03:11:20,830
Yeah, I was like looking at Disney...

3854
03:11:20,830 --> 03:11:21,550
Please!

3855
03:11:21,690 --> 03:11:23,570
Out of fuck... Okay, nice.

3856
03:11:23,710 --> 03:11:24,370
That counts.

3857
03:11:26,750 --> 03:11:27,790
Okay, that counts.

3858
03:11:28,010 --> 03:11:28,730
I take this.

3859
03:11:30,950 --> 03:11:31,630
Uh...

3860
03:11:34,550 --> 03:11:35,110
This way?

3861
03:11:36,550 --> 03:11:37,570
That counts.

3862
03:11:37,790 --> 03:11:38,090
No!

3863
03:11:40,350 --> 03:11:41,950
Let me exploit!

3864
03:11:43,670 --> 03:11:44,510
Oh, hey.

3865
03:11:44,690 --> 03:11:45,870
Let me exploit it.

3866
03:11:46,050 --> 03:11:46,630
Oh, nice.

3867
03:11:46,870 --> 03:11:47,430
That works.

3868
03:11:51,930 --> 03:11:52,610
Yeah!

3869
03:11:54,990 --> 03:11:56,150
That works.

3870
03:11:56,170 --> 03:11:56,690
That's nice.

3871
03:11:57,590 --> 03:11:58,550
Oh, hey guys.

3872
03:12:00,550 --> 03:12:01,630
Hi there.

3873
03:12:01,630 --> 03:12:02,050
I'm so glad you're here.

3874
03:12:03,070 --> 03:12:04,370
What's the deal with the plants?

3875
03:12:04,850 --> 03:12:05,690
It's complicated.

3876
03:12:06,450 --> 03:12:07,330
Let me guess.

3877
03:12:07,890 --> 03:12:08,630
Poison Ivy.

3878
03:12:08,930 --> 03:12:10,250
She teamed up with Joker.

3879
03:12:10,750 --> 03:12:11,770
All that matters...

3880
03:12:11,770 --> 03:12:13,110
I have no idea how to do this legit.

3881
03:12:13,210 --> 03:12:15,530
I'm glad that I've exploited my way into this.

3882
03:12:15,530 --> 03:12:16,890
There's always a but, isn't there?

3883
03:12:17,150 --> 03:12:18,570
Where do you keep Killer Croc?

3884
03:12:18,970 --> 03:12:21,250
I found a door in the sewers, but it's sealed shut.

3885
03:12:21,650 --> 03:12:24,290
That monster's got his own special cell.

3886
03:12:24,510 --> 03:12:27,330
It's right below the transfer room, back in Intensive Treatment.

3887
03:12:27,530 --> 03:12:29,450
Elevator goes right down to an old sewer.

3888
03:12:29,450 --> 03:12:31,910
He just dropped meat down there every day or so.

3889
03:12:32,010 --> 03:12:33,270
And tried to forget about it.

3890
03:12:33,490 --> 03:12:34,390
It's locked off.

3891
03:12:34,510 --> 03:12:35,870
More security than the Joker.

3892
03:12:35,990 --> 03:12:37,670
You won't get in without the Warden's permission.

3893
03:12:37,990 --> 03:12:38,950
He has the codes.

3894
03:12:39,030 --> 03:12:39,930
I have the codes.

3895
03:12:40,050 --> 03:12:40,470
Thanks, Cash.

3896
03:12:41,090 --> 03:12:43,210
Stay here and do not go near the plants.

3897
03:12:43,650 --> 03:12:45,370
How do you, like, not go near?

3898
03:12:45,390 --> 03:12:46,190
They're literally everywhere!

3899
03:12:49,110 --> 03:12:58,550
I like how someone was saying, like, oh, their companies are too scared to do anything but nostalgia bait because they don't want to make anything new.

3900
03:12:58,550 --> 03:13:01,110
They're too scared of spending money that they're losing money!

3901
03:13:01,530 --> 03:13:02,450
That's so stupid!

3902
03:13:07,990 --> 03:13:12,630
Okay, I gain access to Killer Croc's lair via Intensive Treatment.

3903
03:13:12,790 --> 03:13:14,490
I have to get out of here?

3904
03:13:16,450 --> 03:13:16,870
Goddamnit.

3905
03:13:17,270 --> 03:13:19,250
Okay, I need to figure out how to get out of here.

3906
03:13:20,650 --> 03:13:21,690
It's so dumb!

3907
03:13:21,830 --> 03:13:25,970
Because they're too scared of spending money on experimenting...

3908
03:13:25,970 --> 03:13:28,810
I think that they end up making it worse.

3909
03:13:29,690 --> 03:13:31,150
So like, what's the point?

3910
03:13:33,350 --> 03:13:34,890
How do I get out of here now?

3911
03:13:35,330 --> 03:13:38,990
I've already exploded my way to here, but now I don't know how to get there.

3912
03:13:39,470 --> 03:13:40,610
I guess like...

3913
03:13:41,720 --> 03:13:42,230
This way?

3914
03:13:47,890 --> 03:13:48,690
I'm lost.

3915
03:13:59,680 --> 03:14:00,220
Whoops.

3916
03:14:04,400 --> 03:14:04,940
Yeah!

3917
03:14:08,940 --> 03:14:09,680
Yes!

3918
03:14:10,900 --> 03:14:12,580
That's what I like!

3919
03:14:18,030 --> 03:14:19,610
I did it!

3920
03:14:20,890 --> 03:14:23,010
I figured it out!

3921
03:14:23,530 --> 03:14:24,790
The cheese!

3922
03:14:28,050 --> 03:14:31,290
Cheesed my way out and that's how I like it.

3923
03:14:32,150 --> 03:14:33,290
Alright, grapple here.

3924
03:14:37,450 --> 03:14:37,970
Nice!

3925
03:14:38,750 --> 03:14:40,850
That was just that easy.

3926
03:14:49,580 --> 03:14:52,620
Like I said, this island has been well and truly buried.

3927
03:14:52,740 --> 03:14:53,060
Oh well.

3928
03:14:55,640 --> 03:14:59,440
We have to go over here.

3929
03:14:59,760 --> 03:15:02,600
I guess I can go from the right side?

3930
03:15:02,780 --> 03:15:03,460
I'll go right side.

3931
03:15:04,860 --> 03:15:05,380
Weee!

3932
03:15:05,380 --> 03:15:06,660
Any more plants?

3933
03:15:07,740 --> 03:15:09,760
I would like the back treatment.

3934
03:15:11,380 --> 03:15:12,740
50% off!

3935
03:15:14,240 --> 03:15:15,120
Here I go!

3936
03:15:15,240 --> 03:15:15,340
Oh!

3937
03:15:15,360 --> 03:15:16,040
This one plant.

3938
03:15:16,160 --> 03:15:17,340
You thought you could get away.

3939
03:15:18,600 --> 03:15:20,140
You thought you could get away.

3940
03:15:21,020 --> 03:15:21,520
Boop!

3941
03:15:22,560 --> 03:15:23,060
Nice!

3942
03:15:23,220 --> 03:15:24,140
Tell your friends.

3943
03:15:27,100 --> 03:15:28,680
Alright, we gotta fist this one too.

3944
03:15:31,040 --> 03:15:31,540
Boop!

3945
03:15:32,120 --> 03:15:32,620
Nice!

3946
03:15:34,620 --> 03:15:35,220
Alright.

3947
03:15:35,220 --> 03:15:36,240
Sit this way.

3948
03:15:36,340 --> 03:15:36,760
Okay, here.

3949
03:15:37,060 --> 03:15:39,260
Am I even at 50% of this game?

3950
03:15:39,340 --> 03:15:40,020
What the fuck?

3951
03:15:40,560 --> 03:15:42,040
Why are they wearing jackets now?

3952
03:15:43,220 --> 03:15:43,820
See?

3953
03:15:45,980 --> 03:15:47,280
I told... See?

3954
03:15:47,500 --> 03:15:48,660
The Joker's great!

3955
03:15:49,180 --> 03:15:53,400
Their men was cold and the Joker gave them jackets.

3956
03:15:53,500 --> 03:15:55,300
Guys, look at that.

3957
03:15:55,420 --> 03:15:56,540
Now it's bowling time.

3958
03:15:57,220 --> 03:15:57,820
Bowling!

3959
03:16:00,540 --> 03:16:01,000
Nice.

3960
03:16:01,120 --> 03:16:01,440
Three.

3961
03:16:01,660 --> 03:16:02,440
I take this.

3962
03:16:03,980 --> 03:16:04,800
Look at that!

3963
03:16:06,020 --> 03:16:07,940
Joker is so considerate, guys.

3964
03:16:08,800 --> 03:16:11,960
They literally gave them jackets because he doesn't want them to be cold.

3965
03:16:14,720 --> 03:16:16,020
Your boss would never.

3966
03:16:16,240 --> 03:16:17,140
He's so nice.

3967
03:16:17,260 --> 03:16:17,900
I know, right?

3968
03:16:18,040 --> 03:16:18,820
He's so nice!

3969
03:16:21,320 --> 03:16:22,160
That's fucking right.

3970
03:16:24,520 --> 03:16:26,200
I gotta make sure like...

3971
03:16:26,200 --> 03:16:27,580
Oh nice, I took his...

3972
03:16:27,580 --> 03:16:27,800
Oh nice, I took his...

3973
03:16:27,820 --> 03:16:29,460
I took his fucking taser all the way.

3974
03:16:29,940 --> 03:16:33,400
Oh, I wanted to use the weapon for that one time, but not the other time.

3975
03:16:37,200 --> 03:16:37,920
Okay, nice.

3976
03:16:40,200 --> 03:16:40,560
Okay.

3977
03:16:41,440 --> 03:16:42,100
Counter that.

3978
03:16:44,160 --> 03:16:45,740
Where can I throw my batterams?

3979
03:16:47,920 --> 03:16:49,220
Wait, how did he pick that up?

3980
03:16:53,090 --> 03:16:53,710
Alright, nope.

3981
03:16:54,330 --> 03:16:55,130
That's fucking right.

3982
03:16:55,230 --> 03:16:55,590
Counter.

3983
03:16:55,830 --> 03:16:56,830
How did I counter that?

3984
03:16:56,870 --> 03:16:57,110
No!

3985
03:16:58,890 --> 03:16:59,430
Oh shit.

3986
03:16:59,550 --> 03:16:59,990
No, no, no, no.

3987
03:17:00,630 --> 03:17:00,910
Fucking right.

3988
03:17:00,990 --> 03:17:01,870
No, no, no, no, no, no!

3989
03:17:01,870 --> 03:17:02,430
Get away from me!

3990
03:17:04,530 --> 03:17:04,930
Okay.

3991
03:17:05,890 --> 03:17:07,470
Now I'm just gonna go... boop.

3992
03:17:08,910 --> 03:17:09,310
Boop.

3993
03:17:09,310 --> 03:17:09,710
Boop.

3994
03:17:10,490 --> 03:17:10,890
Boop.

3995
03:17:11,530 --> 03:17:11,930
Boop.

3996
03:17:12,370 --> 03:17:12,770
Boop.

3997
03:17:13,090 --> 03:17:14,530
He can die eventually, right?

3998
03:17:15,910 --> 03:17:16,470
That's right.

3999
03:17:17,190 --> 03:17:18,170
He'll die eventually.

4000
03:17:19,370 --> 03:17:21,610
There's no way you can live through all these batterams.

4001
03:17:22,370 --> 03:17:23,170
Simple physics!

4002
03:17:24,370 --> 03:17:25,830
Okay, now I'm just gonna...

4003
03:17:26,950 --> 03:17:28,390
Now you're just pissing me off.

4004
03:17:29,130 --> 03:17:29,530
Hahaha!

4005
03:17:30,630 --> 03:17:31,130
Okay.

4006
03:17:32,010 --> 03:17:33,790
You've lived long enough.

4007
03:17:35,710 --> 03:17:37,410
You've lived long enough.

4008
03:17:40,690 --> 03:17:42,030
Now I see it.

4009
03:17:42,030 --> 03:17:42,830
Now you don't.

4010
03:17:47,400 --> 03:17:49,340
There was a sniper up on the roof.

4011
03:17:49,880 --> 03:17:51,060
He got there somehow.

4012
03:17:51,560 --> 03:17:52,600
I'll find a way.

4013
03:17:52,860 --> 03:17:53,720
Wait, where's the sniper?

4014
03:17:56,120 --> 03:17:56,800
This guy?

4015
03:17:58,520 --> 03:17:59,880
Oh, that guy is the sniper.

4016
03:18:00,060 --> 03:18:00,400
Okay.

4017
03:18:00,560 --> 03:18:02,280
I mean, I can literally just go...

4018
03:18:03,120 --> 03:18:04,280
I can just climb.

4019
03:18:05,640 --> 03:18:06,200
Batman!

4020
03:18:06,480 --> 03:18:07,020
Climb!

4021
03:18:08,320 --> 03:18:09,580
I can't just climb.

4022
03:18:10,340 --> 03:18:10,900
Alright.

4023
03:18:11,960 --> 03:18:12,920
That's not fair.

4024
03:18:13,240 --> 03:18:13,780
Hahaha!

4025
03:18:16,040 --> 03:18:16,600
Alright.

4026
03:18:16,820 --> 03:18:18,480
I thought I could just climb.

4027
03:18:18,700 --> 03:18:19,980
I don't understand.

4028
03:18:20,080 --> 03:18:21,700
You mean I can't just climb everything?

4029
03:18:23,260 --> 03:18:24,400
Who would have thought?

4030
03:18:25,180 --> 03:18:27,220
I can't just climb everything.

4031
03:18:30,360 --> 03:18:30,920
Goodbye.

4032
03:18:32,280 --> 03:18:33,740
Not a spy there.

4033
03:18:36,620 --> 03:18:37,220
Bwee!

4034
03:18:37,460 --> 03:18:38,000
No!

4035
03:18:38,820 --> 03:18:39,580
Oh, wait.

4036
03:18:40,940 --> 03:18:41,540
No!

4037
03:18:41,620 --> 03:18:42,840
I can't just get up there?

4038
03:18:44,120 --> 03:18:45,840
What if I align this?

4039
03:18:46,340 --> 03:18:48,180
There must be an exploit.

4040
03:18:49,180 --> 03:18:50,360
Oh, he sees me.

4041
03:18:50,660 --> 03:18:51,680
No, he doesn't.

4042
03:18:53,460 --> 03:18:54,060
Okay.

4043
03:18:54,120 --> 03:18:55,100
There must be an...

4044
03:18:55,100 --> 03:18:56,240
There's always an exploit.

4045
03:18:58,580 --> 03:19:00,220
There's always an exploit.

4046
03:19:00,760 --> 03:19:01,800
God damn it.

4047
03:19:01,900 --> 03:19:02,260
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

4048
03:19:02,280 --> 03:19:03,980
How the fuck do I get across?

4049
03:19:05,400 --> 03:19:07,460
Go up the tower?

4050
03:19:07,700 --> 03:19:08,600
This tower?

4051
03:19:09,220 --> 03:19:09,900
Okay.

4052
03:19:09,940 --> 03:19:10,820
This must be the tower.

4053
03:19:13,100 --> 03:19:13,780
Eww.

4054
03:19:17,880 --> 03:19:18,560
Okay.

4055
03:19:20,060 --> 03:19:21,240
Oh, there it is!

4056
03:19:21,320 --> 03:19:22,060
I knew it.

4057
03:19:22,140 --> 03:19:23,600
There's always an exploit.

4058
03:19:25,400 --> 03:19:26,080
Hello?

4059
03:19:27,140 --> 03:19:27,820
Hahaha!

4060
03:19:28,160 --> 03:19:29,920
How did you not see that?

4061
03:19:31,060 --> 03:19:32,420
Holy shit!

4062
03:19:33,740 --> 03:19:35,840
Joker, you need to invest in better...

4063
03:19:35,840 --> 03:19:37,240
better goons.

4064
03:19:38,500 --> 03:19:39,520
They're not gonna lie.

4065
03:19:40,480 --> 03:19:42,940
I love 2010 NPCs.

4066
03:19:43,120 --> 03:19:44,940
It made me feel so smart.

4067
03:19:48,050 --> 03:19:49,710
It's dark out.

4068
03:19:49,990 --> 03:19:51,690
Then don't be a fucking sniper!

4069
03:19:52,550 --> 03:19:53,490
Oh, shit.

4070
03:19:53,990 --> 03:19:54,950
Structural integrity.

4071
03:19:55,730 --> 03:19:57,950
I'm seeing seismic activity, okay?

4072
03:19:59,870 --> 03:20:01,330
Ivy's plants are taking hold.

4073
03:20:01,510 --> 03:20:04,650
I've got to stop them before the entire island is under her control.

4074
03:20:06,470 --> 03:20:10,910
If she is not swole as fuck, then this game's a 9 out of 10.

4075
03:20:11,810 --> 03:20:12,930
No swole Ivy.

4076
03:20:14,650 --> 03:20:15,890
It doesn't make sense.

4077
03:20:15,950 --> 03:20:17,990
Why is she not swole but the goons are?

4078
03:20:18,270 --> 03:20:19,390
I don't understand.

4079
03:20:23,130 --> 03:20:24,250
Hey, what's over here?

4080
03:20:28,080 --> 03:20:28,780
Oh, no.

4081
03:20:28,920 --> 03:20:29,740
Am I gonna be lost?

4082
03:20:29,740 --> 03:20:30,000
Am I gonna be lost again?

4083
03:20:34,620 --> 03:20:36,060
I think I'm gonna be lost again.

4084
03:20:40,240 --> 03:20:41,860
Okay, I need to go here.

4085
03:20:42,240 --> 03:20:43,680
Oh my god, I'm gonna be lost again.

4086
03:20:46,160 --> 03:20:48,620
If she is, I swear I'm gonna lose to Batman.

4087
03:20:53,740 --> 03:20:55,200
Plants can be swole?

4088
03:20:55,420 --> 03:20:56,820
What the fuck are you talking about?

4089
03:20:56,980 --> 03:20:57,740
They're thick plants.

4090
03:21:04,280 --> 03:21:05,780
Plants can be plump?

4091
03:21:10,300 --> 03:21:10,920
Okay, let's see.

4092
03:21:12,220 --> 03:21:13,820
I need to figure out how to do this.

4093
03:21:14,040 --> 03:21:16,420
Oh my god, this is a giant ass fucking vent.

4094
03:21:17,160 --> 03:21:17,600
Boop.

4095
03:21:18,560 --> 03:21:19,360
Okay, this way.

4096
03:21:21,440 --> 03:21:22,620
Yeah, have you seen peaches?

4097
03:21:24,220 --> 03:21:25,040
Are they ready?

4098
03:21:25,220 --> 03:21:26,680
I haven't used those yet.

4099
03:21:29,910 --> 03:21:31,570
Razor's just finishing his off now.

4100
03:21:33,410 --> 03:21:33,850
Good.

4101
03:21:33,850 --> 03:21:34,730
Let's test him out.

4102
03:21:35,210 --> 03:21:36,730
No, no, I'm still up.

4103
03:21:37,070 --> 03:21:37,510
Whoa.

4104
03:21:39,590 --> 03:21:42,230
Don't worry, I'm pretty sure Joker has Joker insurance.

4105
03:21:42,530 --> 03:21:43,050
Right?

4106
03:21:48,990 --> 03:21:49,590
Alright.

4107
03:21:51,850 --> 03:21:52,450
Boop.

4108
03:21:57,490 --> 03:22:00,170
Wait, no more inverted takedowns?

4109
03:22:00,530 --> 03:22:03,310
Wait, did he... did he fucked up all the Gorgons?

4110
03:22:08,250 --> 03:22:08,550
Ow.

4111
03:22:10,490 --> 03:22:11,470
Nope, nope.

4112
03:22:12,530 --> 03:22:15,130
There's no way he exploded this one, right?

4113
03:22:17,790 --> 03:22:18,550
There's no way he exploded this one, right?

4114
03:22:18,550 --> 03:22:19,750
He exploded this one.

4115
03:22:23,550 --> 03:22:25,070
There's no...

4116
03:22:28,190 --> 03:22:28,950
There's no...

4117
03:22:28,950 --> 03:22:30,430
Whoa, he doesn't know.

4118
03:22:31,650 --> 03:22:33,490
He doesn't know.

4119
03:22:33,890 --> 03:22:35,750
He doesn't know.

4120
03:22:37,050 --> 03:22:40,530
There's no way they saw me, guys.

4121
03:22:42,090 --> 03:22:42,990
Watch this.

4122
03:22:44,290 --> 03:22:45,310
Bowling time.

4123
03:22:47,910 --> 03:22:48,530
Boop.

4124
03:22:49,790 --> 03:22:50,410
Two.

4125
03:22:52,410 --> 03:22:53,490
Okay, there you go.

4126
03:22:54,490 --> 03:22:56,410
There's no way they saw me here.

4127
03:22:59,290 --> 03:23:00,590
What the fuck?

4128
03:23:00,590 --> 03:23:01,190
I'm in the corner!

4129
03:23:01,910 --> 03:23:02,850
This is...

4130
03:23:04,110 --> 03:23:05,570
This is fucking legal!

4131
03:23:07,330 --> 03:23:07,950
I'm...

4132
03:23:07,950 --> 03:23:09,290
Who shot me?

4133
03:23:09,730 --> 03:23:10,510
Oh, my God!

4134
03:23:14,630 --> 03:23:15,750
Oh, my God!

4135
03:23:16,650 --> 03:23:17,230
Oh, my God!

4136
03:23:17,230 --> 03:23:17,550
Oh, my God!

4137
03:23:17,550 --> 03:23:17,930
Oh, dude, no!

4138
03:23:18,110 --> 03:23:19,470
I can't believe it!

4139
03:23:20,570 --> 03:23:22,690
I can't believe they saw me!

4140
03:23:23,290 --> 03:23:23,730
I can't believe they saw me!

4141
03:23:24,530 --> 03:23:24,970
Okay.

4142
03:23:24,970 --> 03:23:26,330
Okay, this time I got this.

4143
03:23:26,370 --> 03:23:27,630
I can do this.

4144
03:23:29,090 --> 03:23:30,830
I'm... I can do this this time.

4145
03:23:30,870 --> 03:23:32,230
I don't need no gargoyle!

4146
03:23:35,370 --> 03:23:36,510
I don't need no gargoyles!

4147
03:23:37,830 --> 03:23:40,030
The gargoyles are not a crutch for me!

4148
03:23:42,750 --> 03:23:44,590
It's not a crutch, I swear!

4149
03:23:48,050 --> 03:23:50,150
I can't believe they're learning.

4150
03:23:50,290 --> 03:23:52,730
I can't believe the AIs are learning.

4151
03:23:52,890 --> 03:23:53,650
This isn't fair!

4152
03:23:55,410 --> 03:23:57,350
How do you afford all these guns?

4153
03:23:59,830 --> 03:24:00,730
Alright, yeah.

4154
03:24:01,330 --> 03:24:02,410
God damn it.

4155
03:24:02,410 --> 03:24:03,690
Now I actually have to stealth.

4156
03:24:07,790 --> 03:24:09,830
Can I just like keep killing them here?

4157
03:24:10,010 --> 03:24:10,230
Can I just like keep killing them here?

4158
03:24:10,230 --> 03:24:11,310
Or do I just stay in the vent?

4159
03:24:17,660 --> 03:24:19,020
It's not a crutch!

4160
03:24:19,320 --> 03:24:19,640
It's not a crutch!

4161
03:24:19,980 --> 03:24:20,820
I swear!

4162
03:24:25,740 --> 03:24:26,180
Okay.

4163
03:24:26,460 --> 03:24:26,900
Wait.

4164
03:24:31,030 --> 03:24:31,470
Okay.

4165
03:24:32,430 --> 03:24:34,370
I'll just have them all over here.

4166
03:24:34,930 --> 03:24:36,290
And I'll beat them up.

4167
03:24:37,030 --> 03:24:38,010
And I'll beat them up.

4168
03:24:39,550 --> 03:24:40,150
It's okay.

4169
03:24:40,730 --> 03:24:41,410
It's okay.

4170
03:24:41,490 --> 03:24:42,290
They'll have to turn around.

4171
03:24:42,310 --> 03:24:43,510
someday, right?

4172
03:24:44,110 --> 03:24:47,690
Not everybody is totally better than my actual employer.

4173
03:24:48,290 --> 03:24:49,730
Thank you for the super chat.

4174
03:24:49,890 --> 03:24:50,210
Thank you.

4175
03:24:50,250 --> 03:24:50,710
Thank you.

4176
03:24:51,170 --> 03:24:51,850
It's okay.

4177
03:24:51,970 --> 03:24:53,630
They have to turn around soon, right?

4178
03:24:54,710 --> 03:24:55,410
Come on.

4179
03:24:55,570 --> 03:24:56,310
Turn around.

4180
03:24:56,970 --> 03:24:57,930
Turn around.

4181
03:24:58,670 --> 03:25:01,130
Ba da da da da da da da da Ba ba ba.

4182
03:25:01,570 --> 03:25:02,050
Alright.

4183
03:25:02,730 --> 03:25:03,310
That's fine.

4184
03:25:05,570 --> 03:25:06,230
It's fine.

4185
03:25:06,390 --> 03:25:08,990
As long as Joker doesn't ghost me again, we're fine.

4186
03:25:09,950 --> 03:25:11,430
He doesn't do any ghosting.

4187
03:25:11,950 --> 03:25:12,670
Oh my god.

4188
03:25:12,750 --> 03:25:13,050
Look at them.

4189
03:25:13,150 --> 03:25:13,850
They're back to back.

4190
03:25:14,710 --> 03:25:16,010
They covered his back.

4191
03:25:16,090 --> 03:25:16,990
What are these AIs?

4192
03:25:17,170 --> 03:25:17,910
He's so smart.

4193
03:25:18,970 --> 03:25:20,210
He doesn't see me, right?

4194
03:25:20,470 --> 03:25:20,950
Oh no.

4195
03:25:21,050 --> 03:25:22,430
He definitely doesn't see me.

4196
03:25:23,010 --> 03:25:23,370
Alright.

4197
03:25:23,390 --> 03:25:23,650
Come on.

4198
03:25:23,690 --> 03:25:24,110
Come up.

4199
03:25:24,650 --> 03:25:25,190
Come up.

4200
03:25:26,190 --> 03:25:26,990
That's fucking right.

4201
03:25:27,790 --> 03:25:29,110
Go closer to your friend.

4202
03:25:29,610 --> 03:25:30,190
Oh fuck.

4203
03:25:30,270 --> 03:25:30,410
No.

4204
03:25:30,470 --> 03:25:30,950
That's not cool.

4205
03:25:31,410 --> 03:25:32,230
That's not fair.

4206
03:25:32,910 --> 03:25:33,990
Why are you over here?

4207
03:25:36,130 --> 03:25:36,490
Oh.

4208
03:25:36,510 --> 03:25:36,830
Okay.

4209
03:25:39,450 --> 03:25:40,210
Woo!

4210
03:25:45,550 --> 03:25:46,310
Okay.

4211
03:26:02,370 --> 03:26:03,130
Wheeeee.

4212
03:26:05,310 --> 03:26:06,650
Back up, Bako.

4213
03:26:09,150 --> 03:26:10,190
It's not a crutch.

4214
03:26:10,290 --> 03:26:10,850
I swear.

4215
03:26:15,250 --> 03:26:17,970
The gargoyles are not a crutch.

4216
03:26:20,110 --> 03:26:21,330
I swear to god.

4217
03:26:22,150 --> 03:26:22,590
Okay.

4218
03:26:23,350 --> 03:26:23,790
Alright.

4219
03:26:24,550 --> 03:26:25,690
We can do this.

4220
03:26:27,390 --> 03:26:27,830
Alright.

4221
03:26:27,890 --> 03:26:28,230
Oh.

4222
03:26:28,410 --> 03:26:28,690
Oh.

4223
03:26:28,710 --> 03:26:29,250
I have an idea.

4224
03:26:29,410 --> 03:26:30,090
I have an idea.

4225
03:26:30,210 --> 03:26:30,650
I have an idea.

4226
03:26:31,710 --> 03:26:32,150
Okay.

4227
03:26:34,210 --> 03:26:35,190
I'm gonna tag this.

4228
03:26:36,290 --> 03:26:37,190
I have an idea.

4229
03:26:38,190 --> 03:26:39,210
I have an idea.

4230
03:26:39,990 --> 03:26:40,430
Guys.

4231
03:26:41,130 --> 03:26:42,370
I figured it out.

4232
03:26:42,470 --> 03:26:44,010
I'm gonna set up a trap.

4233
03:26:44,910 --> 03:26:45,350
Okay.

4234
03:26:45,370 --> 03:26:46,470
And then...

4235
03:26:46,470 --> 03:26:48,210
And then...

4236
03:26:52,370 --> 03:26:52,890
Okay.

4237
03:26:52,890 --> 03:26:53,270
Wait.

4238
03:26:53,390 --> 03:26:54,490
I can't use this here.

4239
03:26:55,150 --> 03:26:55,650
Wait.

4240
03:26:55,690 --> 03:26:57,070
I can't... I can't... Okay.

4241
03:26:57,690 --> 03:26:58,330
It's okay.

4242
03:26:58,730 --> 03:26:59,450
It's fine.

4243
03:26:59,590 --> 03:27:04,090
I can't... I just realized I cannot use the... use the explosives while in the vent.

4244
03:27:04,210 --> 03:27:05,110
But it's okay.

4245
03:27:05,190 --> 03:27:06,450
He walked into my trap.

4246
03:27:07,030 --> 03:27:08,690
He walked into my trap.

4247
03:27:08,970 --> 03:27:09,970
He was alone.

4248
03:27:11,790 --> 03:27:12,690
There we go.

4249
03:27:12,910 --> 03:27:13,850
It's that easy.

4250
03:27:15,570 --> 03:27:16,590
My trap.

4251
03:27:17,610 --> 03:27:18,590
Being alone.

4252
03:27:19,090 --> 03:27:19,730
Hahaha.

4253
03:27:20,150 --> 03:27:20,670
Hahaha.

4254
03:27:20,990 --> 03:27:21,630
Hahaha.

4255
03:27:24,430 --> 03:27:25,070
Alright.

4256
03:27:25,210 --> 03:27:25,650
Don't worry.

4257
03:27:25,810 --> 03:27:26,210
Don't worry.

4258
03:27:26,310 --> 03:27:27,230
He doesn't know.

4259
03:27:29,810 --> 03:27:31,330
There's no way he knows.

4260
03:27:31,750 --> 03:27:32,390
There's no way he knows.

4261
03:27:32,470 --> 03:27:33,070
Hahaha.

4262
03:27:36,090 --> 03:27:37,830
There's no way.

4263
03:27:38,550 --> 03:27:40,590
There's no way they knew.

4264
03:27:42,090 --> 03:27:43,230
There's no way.

4265
03:27:43,570 --> 03:27:44,770
There's no way.

4266
03:27:44,770 --> 03:27:45,390
There's no way he knows.

4267
03:27:45,390 --> 03:27:45,450
You're alone.

4268
03:27:45,450 --> 03:27:45,910
You're alone.

4269
03:27:46,970 --> 03:27:47,870
You're alone.

4270
03:27:48,490 --> 03:27:49,010
You're alone.

4271
03:27:49,430 --> 03:27:50,930
I'm coming for you.

4272
03:27:51,370 --> 03:27:52,770
You have no friends.

4273
03:27:52,890 --> 03:27:54,410
This is the perfect cover.

4274
03:27:57,370 --> 03:27:58,130
Oh shit.

4275
03:27:58,190 --> 03:27:58,370
Wait.

4276
03:27:58,450 --> 03:27:58,930
That's not great.

4277
03:27:59,150 --> 03:27:59,670
Nevermind.

4278
03:27:59,770 --> 03:28:00,270
Nevermind.

4279
03:28:00,330 --> 03:28:01,130
He has friends now.

4280
03:28:02,030 --> 03:28:03,570
He has friends now guys.

4281
03:28:03,870 --> 03:28:04,610
That's not good.

4282
03:28:04,910 --> 03:28:05,430
Wait.

4283
03:28:05,530 --> 03:28:06,150
Is it bullying time?

4284
03:28:06,930 --> 03:28:07,450
Wait.

4285
03:28:07,470 --> 03:28:07,890
Wait.

4286
03:28:07,910 --> 03:28:08,450
It's bullying time.

4287
03:28:11,590 --> 03:28:12,050
Whoa!

4288
03:28:14,890 --> 03:28:16,250
No, no, don't turn back!

4289
03:28:16,490 --> 03:28:17,310
No, no, no!

4290
03:28:17,390 --> 03:28:18,010
Don't turn back!

4291
03:28:18,090 --> 03:28:18,810
Don't huddle up!

4292
03:28:19,470 --> 03:28:20,470
This is not Mungus!

4293
03:28:20,590 --> 03:28:21,410
Stop huddling!

4294
03:28:21,550 --> 03:28:22,190
It's not fun!

4295
03:28:23,190 --> 03:28:24,970
Oh hey, look at my legs though.

4296
03:28:27,270 --> 03:28:30,130
Holy shit, look at how thick my thighs are though.

4297
03:28:30,130 --> 03:28:36,010
Coker hired the finest goons with exactly 45 degrees of...

4298
03:28:36,010 --> 03:28:36,870
What?!

4299
03:28:36,870 --> 03:28:37,590
No!

4300
03:28:37,810 --> 03:28:38,430
Do not!

4301
03:28:38,530 --> 03:28:38,990
No!

4302
03:28:39,750 --> 03:28:44,290
What did he... Why was he paranoid?!

4303
03:28:45,310 --> 03:28:46,230
No!

4304
03:28:50,010 --> 03:28:52,910
I can't believe you were paranoid!

4305
03:28:53,150 --> 03:28:54,990
We were so close!

4306
03:28:56,190 --> 03:28:57,750
I'm so sad.

4307
03:28:58,070 --> 03:28:59,770
I'm so sad.

4308
03:29:03,450 --> 03:29:05,050
Oh my god.

4309
03:29:05,190 --> 03:29:07,150
I can't believe it.

4310
03:29:07,270 --> 03:29:08,670
Why were you paranoid?

4311
03:29:08,670 --> 03:29:09,590
I don't understand!

4312
03:29:15,390 --> 03:29:18,310
Like, there was no reason to be paranoid!

4313
03:29:25,810 --> 03:29:29,650
All I'm saying was there was no reason for him to be that scared.

4314
03:29:33,990 --> 03:29:35,010
I'm just gonna kill this guy.

4315
03:29:36,630 --> 03:29:36,990
Okay.

4316
03:29:39,130 --> 03:29:39,930
We got this.

4317
03:29:40,010 --> 03:29:41,750
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4318
03:29:41,870 --> 03:29:42,570
This is it.

4319
03:29:42,590 --> 03:29:43,230
This is the try.

4320
03:29:44,030 --> 03:29:44,690
This is it.

4321
03:29:46,390 --> 03:29:46,750
Shhhh.

4322
03:29:48,110 --> 03:29:48,790
This is it.

4323
03:29:54,300 --> 03:29:54,660
Okay.

4324
03:29:56,180 --> 03:29:56,540
Okay.

4325
03:29:56,540 --> 03:29:58,020
Alright, I'm gonna start painting.

4326
03:30:05,490 --> 03:30:05,850
No...

4327
03:30:05,850 --> 03:30:06,150
No...

4328
03:30:08,430 --> 03:30:09,090
No!

4329
03:30:10,990 --> 03:30:11,750
It's fine.

4330
03:30:12,750 --> 03:30:13,750
Not crutch!

4331
03:30:16,670 --> 03:30:17,550
It's fine!

4332
03:30:20,170 --> 03:30:20,830
It's fine!

4333
03:30:20,830 --> 03:30:20,970
Um...

4334
03:30:20,970 --> 03:30:21,650
It's fine.

4335
03:30:21,850 --> 03:30:22,830
It's so fine.

4336
03:30:22,970 --> 03:30:23,870
We're so fine.

4337
03:30:24,990 --> 03:30:26,230
We're so fine.

4338
03:30:26,750 --> 03:30:27,410
Okay.

4339
03:30:27,830 --> 03:30:29,470
If I use...

4340
03:30:31,110 --> 03:30:33,850
If I use this Batarang...

4341
03:30:33,850 --> 03:30:35,650
If I use this Batarang...

4342
03:30:35,650 --> 03:30:35,950
If I use this Batarang...

4343
03:30:35,950 --> 03:30:36,490
Boom!

4344
03:30:36,690 --> 03:30:37,490
There we go.

4345
03:30:38,390 --> 03:30:39,810
He'll ruin everything!

4346
03:30:40,950 --> 03:30:41,990
And then...

4347
03:30:42,530 --> 03:30:44,690
And then I'll use this one.

4348
03:30:47,030 --> 03:30:48,130
And then I'll use this one.

4349
03:30:48,130 --> 03:30:48,190
Oops.

4350
03:30:48,850 --> 03:30:48,910
Oops.

4351
03:30:52,720 --> 03:30:53,240
Alright.

4352
03:30:53,480 --> 03:30:54,960
I'm gonna make sure the other guy...

4353
03:30:54,960 --> 03:30:56,280
Come on.

4354
03:30:56,300 --> 03:30:57,420
One of you must be a loner.

4355
03:31:02,240 --> 03:31:04,420
One of you must not have friends.

4356
03:31:04,620 --> 03:31:05,060
Come on.

4357
03:31:05,320 --> 03:31:06,700
You can't all... Come on.

4358
03:31:06,700 --> 03:31:07,440
You can't all...

4359
03:31:07,900 --> 03:31:09,620
Be on good side together.

4360
03:31:11,220 --> 03:31:11,860
Okay.

4361
03:31:11,940 --> 03:31:12,320
Him.

4362
03:31:12,900 --> 03:31:13,540
Him.

4363
03:31:14,460 --> 03:31:15,100
Him.

4364
03:31:19,860 --> 03:31:21,160
That's looking great.

4365
03:31:25,490 --> 03:31:26,130
Okay.

4366
03:31:26,190 --> 03:31:27,570
See, I told you.

4367
03:31:27,950 --> 03:31:29,950
What do you mean this is painful to watch?

4368
03:31:30,170 --> 03:31:31,310
We're fucking gaming!

4369
03:31:31,930 --> 03:31:33,170
We're gaming right now!

4370
03:31:34,490 --> 03:31:35,130
Okay.

4371
03:31:35,130 --> 03:31:35,690
He's...

4372
03:31:35,690 --> 03:31:36,590
Is he a loner too?

4373
03:31:38,050 --> 03:31:40,650
What is this fucking buddy system shit right now?

4374
03:31:40,950 --> 03:31:41,750
What is this fucking buddy system shit right now?

4375
03:31:43,230 --> 03:31:43,710
Okay.

4376
03:31:43,830 --> 03:31:44,110
Okay.

4377
03:31:44,290 --> 03:31:45,750
Who's not gonna head over there?

4378
03:31:47,370 --> 03:31:47,850
Alright.

4379
03:31:48,270 --> 03:31:48,750
What?

4380
03:31:48,830 --> 03:31:49,950
You're gonna head over there?

4381
03:31:50,090 --> 03:31:50,370
Okay.

4382
03:31:50,450 --> 03:31:51,710
You're gonna check each other out?

4383
03:31:52,350 --> 03:31:53,270
Oh, this guy.

4384
03:31:54,590 --> 03:31:56,310
He's not going to.

4385
03:31:56,950 --> 03:31:57,910
He's not going to.

4386
03:31:58,870 --> 03:31:59,350
Okay.

4387
03:31:59,630 --> 03:32:00,110
Unless...

4388
03:32:00,110 --> 03:32:01,050
Oh my god.

4389
03:32:01,090 --> 03:32:02,050
Why are you doing checking that?

4390
03:32:02,590 --> 03:32:03,710
What are you doing?

4391
03:32:04,810 --> 03:32:06,330
All your friends are over there!

4392
03:32:06,590 --> 03:32:08,170
This guy's a loner, but I can't...

4393
03:32:08,170 --> 03:32:10,650
I can't fucking separate him from the rest.

4394
03:32:11,350 --> 03:32:11,830
Okay.

4395
03:32:13,110 --> 03:32:14,210
I'm gonna put this here.

4396
03:32:16,290 --> 03:32:17,150
No, I didn't.

4397
03:32:18,190 --> 03:32:19,150
No, I didn't.

4398
03:32:20,230 --> 03:32:21,510
Thank you, Super Chat!

4399
03:32:21,610 --> 03:32:21,870
Thank you!

4400
03:32:22,850 --> 03:32:23,970
Don't keep gaming.

4401
03:32:24,250 --> 03:32:25,250
I'm doing my best.

4402
03:32:26,530 --> 03:32:27,010
Okay.

4403
03:32:28,550 --> 03:32:30,070
Are you all just gonna be over there?

4404
03:32:30,450 --> 03:32:31,190
Holy shit.

4405
03:32:31,210 --> 03:32:32,170
They're huddled up together.

4406
03:32:32,330 --> 03:32:32,950
This is legal.

4407
03:32:34,210 --> 03:32:34,690
Alright.

4408
03:32:40,070 --> 03:32:40,270
Okay.

4409
03:32:44,360 --> 03:32:44,960
Whoops.

4410
03:32:46,240 --> 03:32:47,060
Oh my god.

4411
03:32:47,080 --> 03:32:47,580
He's so paranoid.

4412
03:32:48,020 --> 03:32:48,960
I'm gonna leave.

4413
03:32:52,840 --> 03:32:55,100
Why are they all grouped up?

4414
03:32:55,240 --> 03:32:56,380
Where are you?

4415
03:32:58,880 --> 03:33:00,540
Stop grouping up!

4416
03:33:02,600 --> 03:33:04,120
Fuck the buddy system!

4417
03:33:05,840 --> 03:33:07,220
It's not worth it!

4418
03:33:07,520 --> 03:33:07,900
Oh my god.

4419
03:33:07,920 --> 03:33:08,780
They're actually holding hands.

4420
03:33:08,780 --> 03:33:10,920
They're actually holding hands!

4421
03:33:11,040 --> 03:33:12,640
What the fuck is this bullshit?

4422
03:33:13,580 --> 03:33:14,960
Wait, they're actually...

4423
03:33:14,960 --> 03:33:15,940
This is stupid.

4424
03:33:16,180 --> 03:33:16,960
They're holding hands.

4425
03:33:20,950 --> 03:33:21,710
Come on.

4426
03:33:22,130 --> 03:33:22,730
No!

4427
03:33:25,790 --> 03:33:28,050
Woo woo woo woo woo woo woo!

4428
03:33:28,270 --> 03:33:28,290
Woo woo woo woo woo woo woo!

4429
03:33:28,610 --> 03:33:29,210
No.

4430
03:33:29,610 --> 03:33:30,890
You can't come up here.

4431
03:33:31,010 --> 03:33:31,990
I'm fucking on the ceiling.

4432
03:33:37,010 --> 03:33:38,150
Look at them.

4433
03:33:38,990 --> 03:33:40,110
There's no way.

4434
03:33:41,510 --> 03:33:42,510
There's no way.

4435
03:33:44,590 --> 03:33:46,530
What do you mean how did I miss that?

4436
03:33:47,510 --> 03:33:50,190
How did I miss that?

4437
03:33:50,690 --> 03:33:51,170
Okay.

4438
03:33:52,570 --> 03:33:53,490
I got him up.

4439
03:33:53,570 --> 03:33:55,210
He's still not... Fuck he's still camping.

4440
03:33:55,470 --> 03:33:56,950
He's still fucking camping.

4441
03:33:57,150 --> 03:33:57,310
Okay.

4442
03:33:58,170 --> 03:33:58,650
Alright.

4443
03:34:02,570 --> 03:34:03,230
Come on.

4444
03:34:03,290 --> 03:34:03,510
Leave.

4445
03:34:04,250 --> 03:34:04,730
Leave.

4446
03:34:07,610 --> 03:34:08,090
God.

4447
03:34:08,210 --> 03:34:08,930
They're so paranoid.

4448
03:34:08,930 --> 03:34:10,910
This one guy.

4449
03:34:10,990 --> 03:34:12,350
I'm just gonna bone rush him.

4450
03:34:12,950 --> 03:34:14,350
I'm just gonna fucking bone...

4451
03:34:14,350 --> 03:34:16,330
There's no way he can fucking kill me.

4452
03:34:17,390 --> 03:34:18,550
He's just one guy.

4453
03:34:21,610 --> 03:34:22,130
Alright.

4454
03:34:23,610 --> 03:34:24,490
This is it.

4455
03:34:25,510 --> 03:34:26,570
I can do this.

4456
03:34:26,750 --> 03:34:27,230
Watch.

4457
03:34:36,770 --> 03:34:38,310
I'm gonna bone rush him.

4458
03:34:40,070 --> 03:34:40,590
AHHHH!

4459
03:34:45,190 --> 03:34:45,690
Okay.

4460
03:34:47,990 --> 03:34:48,850
It worked.

4461
03:34:51,070 --> 03:34:52,050
I told you.

4462
03:34:52,110 --> 03:34:52,630
There's no way.

4463
03:34:54,270 --> 03:34:55,550
I told you.

4464
03:35:00,140 --> 03:35:01,000
There's no way.

4465
03:35:01,040 --> 03:35:01,200
See?

4466
03:35:01,520 --> 03:35:02,740
Eventually they'll split up.

4467
03:35:04,220 --> 03:35:04,720
Please!

4468
03:35:04,800 --> 03:35:05,080
No!

4469
03:35:05,440 --> 03:35:05,940
No!

4470
03:35:06,140 --> 03:35:06,220
No!

4471
03:35:08,880 --> 03:35:09,560
No!

4472
03:35:09,560 --> 03:35:10,060
No!

4473
03:35:10,060 --> 03:35:13,760
I told you.

4474
03:35:13,800 --> 03:35:14,960
Eventually they'll split up.

4475
03:35:15,880 --> 03:35:16,700
There's no way.

4476
03:35:17,820 --> 03:35:18,980
There's no way.

4477
03:35:19,120 --> 03:35:19,880
I told you.

4478
03:35:19,900 --> 03:35:20,860
They'll split up eventually.

4479
03:35:21,260 --> 03:35:27,600
The buddy system will eventually fail.

4480
03:35:29,060 --> 03:35:29,740
The buddy system will eventually fail.

4481
03:35:29,740 --> 03:35:30,020
There we go.

4482
03:35:30,220 --> 03:35:32,380
The buddy system will fail!

4483
03:35:32,540 --> 03:35:33,160
The buddy system will fail!

4484
03:35:33,160 --> 03:35:33,840
I'm coming with you.

4485
03:35:41,060 --> 03:35:41,580
I'm coming with you.

4486
03:35:41,580 --> 03:35:41,860
I knew it.

4487
03:35:42,020 --> 03:35:42,820
I'm coming with you.

4488
03:35:47,520 --> 03:35:49,760
I don't think I'm gonna bull this correctly.

4489
03:35:50,800 --> 03:35:51,520
That's fine.

4490
03:35:52,020 --> 03:35:52,220
That's fine.

4491
03:36:01,890 --> 03:36:02,410
No.

4492
03:36:08,260 --> 03:36:08,960
There we go.

4493
03:36:09,040 --> 03:36:09,560
There we go.

4494
03:36:09,620 --> 03:36:10,060
They're lining up!

4495
03:36:10,120 --> 03:36:10,600
They're lining up!

4496
03:36:16,770 --> 03:36:17,610
I hate this!

4497
03:36:23,030 --> 03:36:24,410
How the fuck did I miss that?

4498
03:36:24,770 --> 03:36:25,370
How?

4499
03:36:26,810 --> 03:36:27,110
How?

4500
03:36:28,210 --> 03:36:28,810
How?

4501
03:36:31,770 --> 03:36:33,310
I went between them!

4502
03:36:34,090 --> 03:36:34,650
I went between them!

4503
03:36:34,650 --> 03:36:35,390
How is that possible?

4504
03:36:36,030 --> 03:36:38,590
How can you go between them, Doki?

4505
03:36:39,010 --> 03:36:39,510
How can you go between them, Doki?

4506
03:36:40,950 --> 03:36:41,950
Oh my god.

4507
03:36:42,110 --> 03:36:43,970
They're leaving the buddy system.

4508
03:36:44,770 --> 03:36:45,710
This is it.

4509
03:36:46,250 --> 03:36:46,850
This is it.

4510
03:36:52,770 --> 03:36:53,370
No.

4511
03:36:53,890 --> 03:36:56,010
No way.

4512
03:36:56,370 --> 03:36:57,850
This treatment belongs to us.

4513
03:36:58,090 --> 03:36:58,850
Okay.

4514
03:37:01,610 --> 03:37:03,630
They're leaving the buddy system.

4515
03:37:04,930 --> 03:37:05,690
They're leaving the buddy system.

4516
03:37:05,690 --> 03:37:06,330
I knew it!

4517
03:37:06,890 --> 03:37:09,150
The buddy system isn't forever!

4518
03:37:10,490 --> 03:37:11,250
Okay.

4519
03:37:12,190 --> 03:37:12,950
Alright.

4520
03:37:13,870 --> 03:37:15,410
We just gotta kill him.

4521
03:37:16,150 --> 03:37:17,410
This building is ours.

4522
03:37:17,670 --> 03:37:18,730
Joker said so.

4523
03:37:24,060 --> 03:37:25,580
This building is ours.

4524
03:37:25,580 --> 03:37:25,580
Joker said so.

4525
03:37:25,580 --> 03:37:25,640
Go!

4526
03:37:31,200 --> 03:37:31,640
Okay.

4527
03:37:32,080 --> 03:37:32,980
Alright, here we go.

4528
03:37:34,540 --> 03:37:35,240
This is it!

4529
03:37:40,130 --> 03:37:41,030
There's no way I can miss!

4530
03:37:41,350 --> 03:37:42,510
There's no way I can miss!

4531
03:37:44,690 --> 03:37:45,850
That's fucking right!

4532
03:37:46,950 --> 03:37:47,390
Bam!

4533
03:37:48,110 --> 03:37:48,830
There we go.

4534
03:37:51,550 --> 03:37:52,430
I did it.

4535
03:37:54,650 --> 03:37:55,830
That's how you do it.

4536
03:37:56,510 --> 03:37:57,910
That's how you stealth.

4537
03:37:57,910 --> 03:37:58,950
That's how you stealth.

4538
03:37:59,510 --> 03:38:02,790
That's how you stealth, guys.

4539
03:38:04,810 --> 03:38:06,090
Any questions?

4540
03:38:08,290 --> 03:38:09,870
Any questions, guys?

4541
03:38:10,190 --> 03:38:13,870
I'm willing to... I'm here all day!

4542
03:38:15,530 --> 03:38:17,410
Alright, how the fuck do I unlock this?

4543
03:38:18,450 --> 03:38:20,950
It is inside...

4544
03:38:23,510 --> 03:38:25,750
The stealthiest bird out there.

4545
03:38:26,770 --> 03:38:27,850
Where the fuck is...

4546
03:38:27,910 --> 03:38:30,030
What's the code thing for this?

4547
03:38:31,290 --> 03:38:33,670
How the hell am I supposed to hack this?

4548
03:38:34,130 --> 03:38:34,930
What is this?

4549
03:38:36,410 --> 03:38:37,450
What the fuck is this?

4550
03:38:40,310 --> 03:38:41,190
Flawless execution.

4551
03:38:42,030 --> 03:38:43,470
Guys, thank you for the super chat!

4552
03:38:43,610 --> 03:38:44,290
Thank you, thank you!

4553
03:38:44,510 --> 03:38:45,270
No problem.

4554
03:38:46,490 --> 03:38:49,010
Oh, I could have done this and be like peek-a-boo!

4555
03:38:50,070 --> 03:38:51,390
What the fuck do I... Oh, it's over here.

4556
03:38:55,420 --> 03:38:55,860
Alright.

4557
03:38:56,380 --> 03:38:57,400
Joker gas time.

4558
03:39:00,140 --> 03:39:01,020
Let's see.

4559
03:39:01,240 --> 03:39:03,560
It should be here.

4560
03:39:04,520 --> 03:39:05,200
What?

4561
03:39:07,940 --> 03:39:08,620
What?

4562
03:39:13,240 --> 03:39:13,920
What?

4563
03:39:15,320 --> 03:39:16,000
Okay.

4564
03:39:16,000 --> 03:39:17,340
Oh, this...

4565
03:39:20,880 --> 03:39:22,580
Wait, there's a timer?!

4566
03:39:22,920 --> 03:39:23,260
Oh!

4567
03:39:25,120 --> 03:39:25,800
Sorry.

4568
03:39:26,140 --> 03:39:27,100
I didn't realize.

4569
03:39:27,360 --> 03:39:30,340
I actually didn't realize there's been a timer this entire time.

4570
03:39:33,410 --> 03:39:34,090
Alright.

4571
03:39:35,030 --> 03:39:35,710
Nice.

4572
03:39:36,210 --> 03:39:36,650
Nice.

4573
03:39:40,340 --> 03:39:41,140
Oh my god.

4574
03:39:41,200 --> 03:39:42,500
Where the fuck is this one?

4575
03:39:45,400 --> 03:39:45,840
There.

4576
03:39:45,860 --> 03:39:46,840
Oh, this one's harder.

4577
03:39:47,800 --> 03:39:48,440
Oh no.

4578
03:39:52,000 --> 03:39:52,620
There we go.

4579
03:39:52,740 --> 03:39:53,740
Oh my god!

4580
03:39:53,780 --> 03:39:55,920
That one was so difficult, I couldn't find it!

4581
03:39:58,520 --> 03:39:59,580
It's okay, I did it.

4582
03:39:59,620 --> 03:40:00,040
First try.

4583
03:40:01,180 --> 03:40:02,280
First fucking try.

4584
03:40:06,850 --> 03:40:09,010
Can't believe there was a timer this entire time.

4585
03:40:09,790 --> 03:40:11,270
I was definitely not paying attention.

4586
03:40:13,130 --> 03:40:14,370
Thanks for the super chat.

4587
03:40:14,430 --> 03:40:15,170
Thank you, thank you.

4588
03:40:15,230 --> 03:40:15,650
That was amazing.

4589
03:40:15,810 --> 03:40:17,430
See, and on the first try.

4590
03:40:17,470 --> 03:40:17,870
I know.

4591
03:40:18,330 --> 03:40:19,670
Oh my god.

4592
03:40:19,750 --> 03:40:21,490
How does she do it?!

4593
03:40:23,330 --> 03:40:26,350
How the fuck does she do it, guys?

4594
03:40:28,570 --> 03:40:30,970
Truly a gamer of her generation.

4595
03:40:32,430 --> 03:40:33,470
Basically this...

4596
03:40:34,170 --> 03:40:35,970
Hackers are getting a bit hard though.

4597
03:40:38,350 --> 03:40:38,870
Alright.

4598
03:40:39,750 --> 03:40:40,230
I'm gonna go in.

4599
03:40:40,650 --> 03:40:42,190
I had to make sure.

4600
03:40:42,390 --> 03:40:44,430
I had to make sure I was able to go in.

4601
03:40:45,350 --> 03:40:47,350
Wait, what's... what's this for?

4602
03:40:47,590 --> 03:40:48,590
There's nothing in here!

4603
03:40:50,950 --> 03:40:53,370
What's the point of hacking here if there's nothing here?

4604
03:40:55,450 --> 03:40:56,390
What the fuck?

4605
03:40:56,630 --> 03:40:58,870
I felt... I felt cheated out of this.

4606
03:41:00,510 --> 03:41:01,770
Oh my god.

4607
03:41:01,870 --> 03:41:03,610
I felt cheated out of this area.

4608
03:41:03,890 --> 03:41:04,590
Scan the picture?

4609
03:41:04,850 --> 03:41:06,290
Oh shit, was this a riddle?

4610
03:41:07,870 --> 03:41:08,350
Oh.

4611
03:41:09,570 --> 03:41:10,170
Okay.

4612
03:41:10,310 --> 03:41:12,330
I didn't realize there was a riddle here.

4613
03:41:13,070 --> 03:41:14,150
Riddle me this.

4614
03:41:17,490 --> 03:41:19,010
Okay, we gotta go this way.

4615
03:41:19,910 --> 03:41:22,690
Did anyone catch the game last night?

4616
03:41:23,770 --> 03:41:24,290
Huh?

4617
03:41:29,340 --> 03:41:29,940
Uhhhh.

4618
03:41:33,320 --> 03:41:33,920
What?

4619
03:41:48,960 --> 03:41:49,560
What?

4620
03:41:58,000 --> 03:41:58,600
Huh?

4621
03:42:00,220 --> 03:42:01,780
What is it in the back car?

4622
03:42:01,940 --> 03:42:02,520
What?

4623
03:42:02,520 --> 03:42:03,560
Joker!

4624
03:42:20,780 --> 03:42:21,440
What?

4625
03:42:24,970 --> 03:42:27,250
Oh my god, it's so cool!

4626
03:42:30,230 --> 03:42:30,890
Oh

4627
03:42:36,290 --> 03:42:37,410
my god, it's so cool!

4628
03:42:37,770 --> 03:42:38,650
I get to play Joker!

4629
03:42:40,690 --> 03:42:42,750
Oh my god, it's like...

4630
03:42:42,750 --> 03:42:44,310
Yeah, role reversal!

4631
03:42:45,090 --> 03:42:45,770
Yeah, role reversal!

4632
03:42:45,770 --> 03:42:47,570
Yeah, role reversal!

4633
03:42:47,610 --> 03:42:48,070
The asylum

4634
03:42:54,430 --> 03:42:56,410
was run by the criminals.

4635
03:42:57,350 --> 03:43:00,110
Just got to check your prisoner, dear.

4636
03:43:00,390 --> 03:43:00,610
Just got to check your prisoner, dear.

4637
03:43:00,610 --> 03:43:01,170
Whatever!

4638
03:43:01,890 --> 03:43:02,970
Just be quick!

4639
03:43:02,990 --> 03:43:03,370
Woah!

4640
03:43:03,790 --> 03:43:04,790
Not looking too good!

4641
03:43:05,210 --> 03:43:06,550
No, he's not!

4642
03:43:06,830 --> 03:43:09,470
We really should feel sorry for him.

4643
03:43:09,550 --> 03:43:11,930
He never fully got over his parent's death.

4644
03:43:12,250 --> 03:43:14,310
It left him wide insane.

4645
03:43:15,610 --> 03:43:16,990
Oh my god, massie drop!

4646
03:43:17,150 --> 03:43:17,970
Thank you for the fifty!

4647
03:43:18,050 --> 03:43:18,570
Get the ships!

4648
03:43:18,690 --> 03:43:18,930
Thank you!

4649
03:43:18,970 --> 03:43:19,510
Thank you!

4650
03:43:19,830 --> 03:43:20,970
I appreciate it.

4651
03:43:20,990 --> 03:43:21,290
Thank you.

4652
03:43:21,910 --> 03:43:23,010
He's gone.

4653
03:43:23,370 --> 03:43:25,050
How does he know am I dead to me?

4654
03:43:27,290 --> 03:43:28,290
Cut me free!

4655
03:43:28,290 --> 03:43:28,330
Oh!

4656
03:43:28,470 --> 03:43:28,930
Cut me free!

4657
03:43:28,930 --> 03:43:30,470
Cut me free!

4658
03:43:34,410 --> 03:43:36,310
Am I using my Bruce Wayne voice?

4659
03:43:38,130 --> 03:43:40,170
No, put me back, I wanna be the Joker.

4660
03:43:41,890 --> 03:43:42,470
Oh!

4661
03:43:51,240 --> 03:43:52,220
Oh, what?

4662
03:43:54,040 --> 03:43:55,200
I don't...

4663
03:43:56,040 --> 03:43:58,080
How the fuck was I supposed to know?

4664
03:43:58,260 --> 03:44:00,560
Rest in peace, Bruce Wayne!

4665
03:44:01,140 --> 03:44:02,480
Oh shit!

4666
03:44:04,880 --> 03:44:08,260
How the fuck was I supposed to know I was supposed to die?

4667
03:44:09,260 --> 03:44:09,780
Whoa!

4668
03:44:10,100 --> 03:44:11,000
Wait, what?

4669
03:44:21,760 --> 03:44:23,880
I thought it was still a cutscene!

4670
03:44:24,460 --> 03:44:27,000
I thought we were still in a cutscene!

4671
03:44:31,830 --> 03:44:33,090
Are you okay, Batman?

4672
03:44:34,270 --> 03:44:35,650
He is not okay.

4673
03:44:41,950 --> 03:44:43,950
Am I... what am I...

4674
03:44:44,970 --> 03:44:46,310
I guess I'll fly here.

4675
03:44:46,450 --> 03:44:48,150
Oh shit, I don't know where to fly to.

4676
03:44:49,950 --> 03:44:51,210
Did I exploit it?

4677
03:44:51,610 --> 03:44:52,030
No.

4678
03:44:55,670 --> 03:44:56,090
What?

4679
03:44:56,090 --> 03:44:56,990
Oh, line?

4680
03:44:57,670 --> 03:44:58,730
Oh, I have my gadgets!

4681
03:44:58,930 --> 03:44:59,950
I didn't know I had my gadgets.

4682
03:45:07,070 --> 03:45:08,870
I didn't know I had my gadgets with me.

4683
03:45:08,930 --> 03:45:09,830
I thought like...

4684
03:45:09,830 --> 03:45:11,190
What are you doing, little bat?

4685
03:45:19,480 --> 03:45:20,360
Okay, it's time.

4686
03:45:26,080 --> 03:45:26,800
Go up.

4687
03:45:27,160 --> 03:45:27,720
Go up!

4688
03:45:27,940 --> 03:45:28,360
What?

4689
03:45:28,540 --> 03:45:28,920
How?

4690
03:45:30,220 --> 03:45:30,640
How?

4691
03:45:30,640 --> 03:45:31,220
How?

4692
03:45:32,320 --> 03:45:34,200
I was so fast!

4693
03:45:34,740 --> 03:45:35,280
Come on!

4694
03:45:35,460 --> 03:45:37,000
That was bullshit.

4695
03:45:37,520 --> 03:45:39,680
That was fucking bullshit.

4696
03:45:39,980 --> 03:45:40,420
What?

4697
03:45:44,360 --> 03:45:45,820
Oh my god!

4698
03:45:46,140 --> 03:45:48,540
Okay, that was also bullshit.

4699
03:45:56,150 --> 03:45:57,330
Okay, here you go.

4700
03:45:59,130 --> 03:45:59,910
It's a joke!

4701
03:45:59,930 --> 03:46:01,350
There is no middle stick!

4702
03:46:01,610 --> 03:46:02,190
You...

4703
03:46:02,190 --> 03:46:04,990
You fuckers, I actually thought I fucked up.

4704
03:46:05,070 --> 03:46:07,130
I actually thought I fucked up.

4705
03:46:07,130 --> 03:46:09,110
I was like, I thought you made like middle button.

4706
03:46:09,310 --> 03:46:11,010
You know, like the middle mouse button?

4707
03:46:14,030 --> 03:46:15,950
I was like, oh my god!

4708
03:46:16,050 --> 03:46:17,070
You mean I can dodge?

4709
03:46:19,450 --> 03:46:22,470
You fucker, I actually thought I fucked it up.

4710
03:46:28,470 --> 03:46:29,950
Gotta get him out of here.

4711
03:46:31,650 --> 03:46:33,370
I was like, no!

4712
03:46:33,550 --> 03:46:35,350
There was a middle mouse button!

4713
03:46:40,010 --> 03:46:40,890
No!

4714
03:46:41,510 --> 03:46:42,250
No!

4715
03:46:42,270 --> 03:46:43,970
I actually did crash!

4716
03:46:44,710 --> 03:46:45,150
No!

4717
03:46:46,490 --> 03:46:48,350
God damn it!

4718
03:46:49,670 --> 03:46:52,610
I actually did crash!

4719
03:46:54,610 --> 03:46:55,490
No!

4720
03:47:01,610 --> 03:47:03,010
The real crash!

4721
03:47:04,410 --> 03:47:08,490
But holy shit, the Joker glitch thing actually scared the shit out of me.

4722
03:47:08,490 --> 03:47:09,170
I was like, what the fuck?

4723
03:47:09,290 --> 03:47:10,370
I was like, oh my god!

4724
03:47:10,570 --> 03:47:13,310
Is my PC actually done for real real now?

4725
03:47:17,550 --> 03:47:19,390
I was like, oh fuck!

4726
03:47:19,890 --> 03:47:23,930
Maybe my PC is finally rest in peace for reals.

4727
03:47:26,010 --> 03:47:28,110
Maybe if I had a middle stick button.

4728
03:47:33,400 --> 03:47:35,320
Okay, where did it leave me off?

4729
03:47:36,780 --> 03:47:37,920
Where did I die?

4730
03:47:41,780 --> 03:47:43,120
Okay, it's not that bad.

4731
03:47:43,220 --> 03:47:44,100
Okay, thank god.

4732
03:47:44,620 --> 03:47:45,760
Oh my god, thank god.

4733
03:47:45,820 --> 03:47:46,820
I actually hit a safe point.

4734
03:47:56,030 --> 03:47:57,470
Am I stuck there?

4735
03:47:58,610 --> 03:47:59,050
Wait!

4736
03:47:59,350 --> 03:47:59,950
Am I?

4737
03:48:00,110 --> 03:48:01,970
Oh my god, am I locked?

4738
03:48:02,050 --> 03:48:02,790
No way!

4739
03:48:03,130 --> 03:48:04,850
Okay, there's no way!

4740
03:48:04,970 --> 03:48:07,630
There's no way I'm fucked right now!

4741
03:48:11,850 --> 03:48:13,530
Cheater, thank you for the superchat!

4742
03:48:13,690 --> 03:48:14,650
Thank you, thank you!

4743
03:48:14,830 --> 03:48:15,150
Hello!

4744
03:48:15,910 --> 03:48:17,010
There's no way.

4745
03:48:17,190 --> 03:48:20,550
There's no fucking way I would, I cannot progress!

4746
03:48:24,530 --> 03:48:26,210
No, no, no.

4747
03:48:26,550 --> 03:48:29,050
There's no way I'm softlocked, please!

4748
03:48:36,950 --> 03:48:37,630
Please!

4749
03:48:37,630 --> 03:48:39,490
Middle bass button, where are you?

4750
03:48:39,990 --> 03:48:41,670
Where are you?

4751
03:48:45,130 --> 03:48:45,810
Okay.

4752
03:48:46,810 --> 03:48:49,550
Okay, there's no way I'm actually softlocked here.

4753
03:48:49,590 --> 03:48:50,770
There's no fucking way.

4754
03:48:52,730 --> 03:48:53,410
Okay.

4755
03:48:53,410 --> 03:48:54,210
Okay.

4756
03:48:54,550 --> 03:48:55,150
Wait.

4757
03:48:56,610 --> 03:48:57,170
Okay.

4758
03:48:58,050 --> 03:48:59,410
I'm out of here.

4759
03:49:00,410 --> 03:49:01,470
I'm out of here!

4760
03:49:01,910 --> 03:49:02,710
We're okay!

4761
03:49:03,170 --> 03:49:05,050
We're okay, we're okay, we're okay!

4762
03:49:10,930 --> 03:49:12,190
We're okay, guys!

4763
03:49:15,190 --> 03:49:17,610
We made it past that one area!

4764
03:49:24,250 --> 03:49:25,610
Thank you, this is rich.

4765
03:49:25,610 --> 03:49:26,550
Thank you, thank you.

4766
03:49:26,910 --> 03:49:28,890
Oh my god, thank fucking god.

4767
03:49:29,150 --> 03:49:30,150
We're so back.

4768
03:49:31,650 --> 03:49:33,370
We're so back, we're so back.

4769
03:49:33,470 --> 03:49:34,570
We are so back.

4770
03:49:35,950 --> 03:49:36,510
Shit.

4771
03:49:37,210 --> 03:49:37,950
I don't know why.

4772
03:49:38,970 --> 03:49:39,530
Climb.

4773
03:49:42,430 --> 03:49:42,990
Climb!

4774
03:49:45,150 --> 03:49:45,710
Climb!

4775
03:49:53,630 --> 03:49:55,030
Okay, it's not over yet.

4776
03:49:58,210 --> 03:49:59,070
It's not over.

4777
03:50:02,090 --> 03:50:02,490
Okay.

4778
03:50:06,250 --> 03:50:09,130
I can't because you're the scarecrow for a reason!

4779
03:50:10,470 --> 03:50:11,130
Climb, please.

4780
03:50:12,130 --> 03:50:12,890
Oh god, okay.

4781
03:50:13,690 --> 03:50:15,070
You ain't killing me, I'm you!

4782
03:50:17,890 --> 03:50:19,450
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

4783
03:50:20,070 --> 03:50:20,930
Oh, thank god.

4784
03:50:23,890 --> 03:50:25,130
Oh, thank god, okay.

4785
03:50:27,510 --> 03:50:29,690
Can you make sure I don't die here?

4786
03:50:32,410 --> 03:50:35,290
Bro, this trip is freaking me out, bro.

4787
03:50:38,090 --> 03:50:38,710
Okay.

4788
03:50:41,030 --> 03:50:41,650
Nice.

4789
03:50:44,250 --> 03:50:44,870
Huh?

4790
03:50:47,590 --> 03:50:48,210
No!

4791
03:51:00,740 --> 03:51:02,140
No, I have to do this again!

4792
03:51:02,420 --> 03:51:04,120
No, scarecrow!

4793
03:51:05,320 --> 03:51:07,780
This is not good for my brain.

4794
03:51:07,840 --> 03:51:09,560
My brain chemistry in the end.

4795
03:51:09,760 --> 03:51:14,840
There's no way that the scarecrow toxins is like good for the brain.

4796
03:51:15,140 --> 03:51:18,300
What are the long-term effects from the fear toxins?

4797
03:51:19,020 --> 03:51:22,180
Like, like brain chemistry wise.

4798
03:51:26,950 --> 03:51:27,730
Yeah, I'm...

4799
03:51:27,730 --> 03:51:30,330
This is a very bad trip right now.

4800
03:51:34,110 --> 03:51:35,810
I just punch you in...

4801
03:51:36,690 --> 03:51:37,170
Oh.

4802
03:51:40,290 --> 03:51:41,470
They're just skeletons.

4803
03:51:45,310 --> 03:51:46,430
Wait, are you like...

4804
03:51:46,430 --> 03:51:47,530
Do I need a batter-arm you?

4805
03:51:47,750 --> 03:51:48,610
Are you gonna charge?

4806
03:51:50,570 --> 03:51:52,030
Are you the batter-arm skeletons?

4807
03:51:53,330 --> 03:51:55,310
Oh, he is the batter-arm skeletons.

4808
03:51:56,090 --> 03:51:56,910
Wait, wait!

4809
03:51:57,210 --> 03:51:57,690
Hahaha!

4810
03:51:57,690 --> 03:51:58,030
Hahaha!

4811
03:52:04,340 --> 03:52:05,840
It still works.

4812
03:52:06,200 --> 03:52:08,240
Guys, it still works!

4813
03:52:08,340 --> 03:52:08,660
Guys!

4814
03:52:09,180 --> 03:52:11,660
It still worked!

4815
03:52:11,920 --> 03:52:12,280
Okay.

4816
03:52:14,290 --> 03:52:15,200
It's still...

4817
03:52:15,200 --> 03:52:16,980
It's still okay.

4818
03:52:17,260 --> 03:52:18,400
Like, I still got it.

4819
03:52:18,580 --> 03:52:19,040
Okay.

4820
03:52:21,180 --> 03:52:22,960
That's failed successfully.

4821
03:52:23,640 --> 03:52:25,440
I don't think I was supposed to know!

4822
03:52:25,760 --> 03:52:27,000
I didn't know!

4823
03:52:27,900 --> 03:52:28,600
Hahaha!

4824
03:52:28,600 --> 03:52:28,720
Hahaha!

4825
03:52:32,280 --> 03:52:34,500
I didn't already batter-arm'd him!

4826
03:52:35,700 --> 03:52:37,420
Really dodged him.

4827
03:52:37,660 --> 03:52:38,880
I'm alive still.

4828
03:52:41,680 --> 03:52:42,480
Yeah!

4829
03:52:49,990 --> 03:52:50,790
Easy.

4830
03:52:51,350 --> 03:52:52,770
Bring me back to the Joker.

4831
03:52:56,410 --> 03:52:58,270
Oh my god, you have eyes!

4832
03:52:58,930 --> 03:52:59,730
More!

4833
03:52:59,730 --> 03:53:00,010
More!

4834
03:53:03,470 --> 03:53:03,910
Bro!

4835
03:53:05,350 --> 03:53:05,790
Bro!

4836
03:53:06,970 --> 03:53:09,470
What the fuck is wrong with me?

4837
03:53:09,630 --> 03:53:09,890
What the fuck is wrong with me?

4838
03:53:09,890 --> 03:53:11,170
Did I like get used to it?

4839
03:53:11,610 --> 03:53:11,970
Did I like get used to it?

4840
03:53:15,170 --> 03:53:16,410
Bro, I think like...

4841
03:53:16,410 --> 03:53:17,070
Bro, I think like...

4842
03:53:17,070 --> 03:53:19,250
I'm just like so used to toxins now.

4843
03:53:20,450 --> 03:53:20,890
Yes!

4844
03:53:22,970 --> 03:53:23,850
I'm bat-bat.

4845
03:53:24,090 --> 03:53:24,130
I'm bat-bat.

4846
03:53:26,450 --> 03:53:27,210
Alright, nice.

4847
03:53:27,250 --> 03:53:27,930
We can love-love.

4848
03:53:28,210 --> 03:53:29,230
Alright, what do we get?

4849
03:53:29,310 --> 03:53:29,530
Guys?

4850
03:53:32,940 --> 03:53:34,640
What should our upgrades be, guys?

4851
03:53:35,200 --> 03:53:36,060
What should our upgrades be, guys?

4852
03:53:40,340 --> 03:53:42,260
We already have remote batter-arm'd!

4853
03:53:42,300 --> 03:53:42,360
We already have remote batter-arm'd!

4854
03:53:42,360 --> 03:53:44,400
Did you not see that all the times I fucking...

4855
03:53:44,400 --> 03:53:46,800
was successfully able to...

4856
03:53:46,800 --> 03:53:49,580
hit people with my batter-arm'd?

4857
03:53:49,900 --> 03:53:49,920
hit people with my batter-arm'd?

4858
03:53:51,000 --> 03:53:52,100
Twin batter-arm'd?

4859
03:53:52,200 --> 03:53:52,800
Okay, I'll get twin.

4860
03:53:54,960 --> 03:53:55,840
How do I do this?

4861
03:53:56,140 --> 03:53:58,660
So like, aim, L, T, N, R, T?

4862
03:54:00,600 --> 03:54:01,040
Okay.

4863
03:54:01,220 --> 03:54:01,580
Nice.

4864
03:54:01,680 --> 03:54:01,920
Okay.

4865
03:54:02,000 --> 03:54:02,840
That should be okay.

4866
03:54:03,100 --> 03:54:03,420
Okay.

4867
03:54:03,420 --> 03:54:03,420
Nice.

4868
03:54:03,420 --> 03:54:03,420
Okay.

4869
03:54:03,420 --> 03:54:03,420
That should be okay.

4870
03:54:04,660 --> 03:54:05,840
It's this way.

4871
03:54:09,020 --> 03:54:11,900
Guys, all the times I've successfully, you know...

4872
03:54:11,900 --> 03:54:13,480
hit my targets...

4873
03:54:14,220 --> 03:54:15,480
Brain's got the brain.

4874
03:54:15,600 --> 03:54:17,040
Thank you for the super chat.

4875
03:54:17,120 --> 03:54:17,480
Thank you.

4876
03:54:17,500 --> 03:54:17,960
Thank you.

4877
03:54:23,680 --> 03:54:25,400
Oh my god, he has eyes!

4878
03:54:26,320 --> 03:54:26,900
Oh my god, he has eyes!

4879
03:54:29,160 --> 03:54:30,780
Did I just drop down?

4880
03:54:31,180 --> 03:54:33,240
It'll be alright if I just drop down, right?

4881
03:54:33,660 --> 03:54:33,760
It'll be alright if I just drop down, right?

4882
03:54:40,840 --> 03:54:42,800
What will happen if I just...

4883
03:54:42,800 --> 03:54:42,960
What will happen if I just...

4884
03:54:43,540 --> 03:54:44,440
fall down?

4885
03:54:49,540 --> 03:54:50,460
Yeah, see?

4886
03:54:51,560 --> 03:54:52,640
It'll be fine.

4887
03:54:53,960 --> 03:54:55,420
Like, why am I scared?

4888
03:54:55,840 --> 03:54:55,880
Like, why am I scared?

4889
03:54:55,880 --> 03:54:57,500
I can just do this and then...

4890
03:54:58,280 --> 03:54:58,920
Easy!

4891
03:55:00,520 --> 03:55:01,500
Look at that!

4892
03:55:03,460 --> 03:55:04,900
What's down there?

4893
03:55:05,300 --> 03:55:06,720
Killer Croc Cell.

4894
03:55:07,340 --> 03:55:08,800
Hell, you first restored.

4895
03:55:11,040 --> 03:55:12,080
Same difference.

4896
03:55:12,340 --> 03:55:14,260
No one goes in and comes out again.

4897
03:55:14,460 --> 03:55:15,340
Oh, here.

4898
03:55:15,580 --> 03:55:16,100
There's stairs.

4899
03:55:16,580 --> 03:55:17,600
So why is Scarecrow going down there?

4900
03:55:22,410 --> 03:55:23,690
Alright, don't worry.

4901
03:55:23,970 --> 03:55:26,450
I can use my double batarangs for this.

4902
03:55:26,550 --> 03:55:27,030
Watch this.

4903
03:55:30,780 --> 03:55:31,340
Bam!

4904
03:55:31,640 --> 03:55:33,040
Look at that!

4905
03:55:34,180 --> 03:55:35,040
Get over here!

4906
03:55:35,040 --> 03:55:36,200
You can't five second roll!

4907
03:55:36,260 --> 03:55:36,620
No gun!

4908
03:55:36,980 --> 03:55:37,880
Five second roll!

4909
03:55:38,120 --> 03:55:38,560
No gun!

4910
03:55:39,160 --> 03:55:39,640
Alright.

4911
03:55:41,100 --> 03:55:42,060
Look at that.

4912
03:55:42,260 --> 03:55:43,280
I told you.

4913
03:55:44,380 --> 03:55:44,860
Successfully!

4914
03:55:46,240 --> 03:55:48,320
I told you I can do this successfully.

4915
03:55:59,820 --> 03:56:02,140
Oh, this is when she was Harley and Quinzel?

4916
03:56:25,100 --> 03:56:27,960
Oh yeah, like no doctor has ever said that.

4917
03:56:27,960 --> 03:56:32,080
Oh yeah, like no doctor has ever said that.

4918
03:56:36,400 --> 03:56:37,360
Damn Joker.

4919
03:56:37,760 --> 03:56:38,880
He's such a Rizzly.

4920
03:56:40,900 --> 03:56:42,020
Oh my god.

4921
03:56:42,100 --> 03:56:44,200
He knows how to charm a woman!

4922
03:56:44,640 --> 03:56:45,120
He knows how to charm a woman!

4923
03:56:45,580 --> 03:56:49,740
If he was a streamer, he would have so much Akasupas.

4924
03:56:51,660 --> 03:56:53,020
Thank you for the super chat!

4925
03:56:53,140 --> 03:56:53,340
Thank you!

4926
03:56:54,320 --> 03:56:57,160
Depending on the version of Toxin, Harley uses it recreationally.

4927
03:56:57,900 --> 03:56:58,580
Makes sense.

4928
03:56:58,600 --> 03:56:59,540
Yeah, I was gonna say.

4929
03:56:59,640 --> 03:57:02,320
I'm pretty sure I built like a tolerance or some shit by then.

4930
03:57:02,700 --> 03:57:03,660
What is this?

4931
03:57:03,860 --> 03:57:04,420
A scan?

4932
03:57:06,960 --> 03:57:07,560
No.

4933
03:57:07,640 --> 03:57:08,020
No.

4934
03:57:09,880 --> 03:57:13,020
Thank you, Batman, for the Akasupa!

4935
03:57:18,660 --> 03:57:20,260
I feel like...

4936
03:57:20,260 --> 03:57:20,880
You know what?

4937
03:57:20,980 --> 03:57:27,400
I feel like if he streamed this crime, he would have so many fans on the dark web.

4938
03:57:29,360 --> 03:57:30,500
Alright, let's see.

4939
03:57:30,600 --> 03:57:31,200
Hacking time.

4940
03:57:38,080 --> 03:57:43,480
It's like how women and men send letters to...

4941
03:57:44,140 --> 03:57:45,060
Wait, what the fuck?

4942
03:57:45,940 --> 03:57:46,240
What?

4943
03:57:47,160 --> 03:57:48,620
How am I not getting... Okay.

4944
03:57:48,760 --> 03:57:53,500
You know how some women and men send love letters to serial killers in prison?

4945
03:57:54,860 --> 03:57:56,700
He'd be able to find somebody.

4946
03:57:59,560 --> 03:58:01,120
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

4947
03:58:01,160 --> 03:58:01,760
I can't find it.

4948
03:58:01,820 --> 03:58:02,480
I can't find it.

4949
03:58:02,540 --> 03:58:02,920
I can't.

4950
03:58:03,320 --> 03:58:04,860
Last few seconds.

4951
03:58:04,960 --> 03:58:05,220
Nice.

4952
03:58:09,700 --> 03:58:10,180
Yeah!

4953
03:58:10,420 --> 03:58:10,740
Yeah!

4954
03:58:11,020 --> 03:58:13,580
A lot of serial killers have wives and...

4955
03:58:13,580 --> 03:58:16,580
have outside wives and husbands.

4956
03:58:18,920 --> 03:58:20,740
There was this famous...

4957
03:58:20,740 --> 03:58:23,260
There was a murderer or something that was on trial.

4958
03:58:23,600 --> 03:58:26,020
And then... I don't know if it was a guy or a girl.

4959
03:58:26,620 --> 03:58:29,540
I think it was fangirls were like, Oh my god!

4960
03:58:29,680 --> 03:58:30,600
He's so hot!

4961
03:58:30,660 --> 03:58:31,760
He can't be a murderer!

4962
03:58:32,000 --> 03:58:32,700
Look at him!

4963
03:58:32,760 --> 03:58:33,700
He's just misunderstood!

4964
03:58:34,260 --> 03:58:35,500
He's so hot though!

4965
03:58:35,700 --> 03:58:36,880
And I'm just like, what the fuck is...

4966
03:58:37,800 --> 03:58:39,160
I'm just...

4967
03:58:41,160 --> 03:58:43,160
I'm just like, what the fuck?

4968
03:58:45,700 --> 03:58:46,380
Bro!

4969
03:58:47,740 --> 03:58:49,060
No, it wasn't.

4970
03:58:49,080 --> 03:58:50,300
It was someone recent.

4971
03:58:52,020 --> 03:58:53,980
I can fix him!

4972
03:58:54,060 --> 03:58:57,660
Even though he murdered so many women, he wouldn't murder me.

4973
03:58:58,360 --> 03:59:00,460
Like, what the fuck?

4974
03:59:00,460 --> 03:59:01,420
Holy shit!

4975
03:59:02,080 --> 03:59:02,760
Bro.

4976
03:59:03,820 --> 03:59:04,860
Like, please.

4977
03:59:10,200 --> 03:59:11,340
Okay, it's bullet time.

4978
03:59:11,720 --> 03:59:12,380
Wait, I don't need a bullet.

4979
03:59:12,480 --> 03:59:13,280
I can use two...

4980
03:59:14,480 --> 03:59:14,880
Nice.

4981
03:59:16,580 --> 03:59:17,840
Okay, I can keep doing it.

4982
03:59:18,320 --> 03:59:19,540
Oh, he's getting guns!

4983
03:59:19,640 --> 03:59:20,240
I forgot!

4984
03:59:20,500 --> 03:59:20,600
Oh!

4985
03:59:20,760 --> 03:59:21,240
That's right.

4986
03:59:21,320 --> 03:59:21,820
No guns.

4987
03:59:21,880 --> 03:59:22,360
No guns.

4988
03:59:24,840 --> 03:59:25,240
Okay.

4989
03:59:25,960 --> 03:59:26,700
There's no guns.

4990
03:59:26,760 --> 03:59:27,380
I can fly.

4991
03:59:29,820 --> 03:59:32,140
It does... It happens a lot more...

4992
03:59:32,660 --> 03:59:35,080
Like, a lot more frequently than you expect.

4993
03:59:35,540 --> 03:59:36,120
Get out.

4994
03:59:36,260 --> 03:59:36,840
No gun.

4995
03:59:37,660 --> 03:59:38,840
This is a fair match.

4996
03:59:41,920 --> 03:59:42,700
That's fucking right.

4997
03:59:42,740 --> 03:59:43,200
Get over here.

4998
03:59:43,380 --> 03:59:44,260
Get over here!

4999
03:59:44,780 --> 03:59:45,460
Oh, shit.

5000
03:59:47,320 --> 03:59:47,920
It's okay.

5001
03:59:48,980 --> 03:59:50,360
Gotta dodge all these guys.

5002
03:59:52,340 --> 03:59:52,780
Nice.

5003
03:59:53,100 --> 03:59:53,540
Throw.

5004
03:59:53,620 --> 03:59:53,860
Throw.

5005
03:59:53,940 --> 03:59:54,140
Throw!

5006
03:59:54,420 --> 03:59:54,860
Throw!

5007
03:59:58,400 --> 03:59:58,840
Okay.

5008
03:59:59,800 --> 04:00:00,940
We gotta get him out of here.

5009
04:00:01,280 --> 04:00:02,680
I can't do a takedown!

5010
04:00:02,800 --> 04:00:03,820
They're all trying to get the gun!

5011
04:00:04,980 --> 04:00:05,420
No.

5012
04:00:05,640 --> 04:00:06,600
No gun for you!

5013
04:00:07,860 --> 04:00:08,300
No!

5014
04:00:08,300 --> 04:00:09,300
There's too many people!

5015
04:00:09,500 --> 04:00:09,720
Yes!

5016
04:00:11,340 --> 04:00:11,740
Okay.

5017
04:00:11,880 --> 04:00:13,680
One of you guys would let me do a finish, right?

5018
04:00:19,810 --> 04:00:20,210
Nice.

5019
04:00:20,210 --> 04:00:20,610
We're fine.

5020
04:00:23,910 --> 04:00:24,310
Nice.

5021
04:00:24,490 --> 04:00:25,850
Why can't I get a gun?

5022
04:00:27,090 --> 04:00:30,390
I know, like, I keep asking about it, but I just want gun.

5023
04:00:31,750 --> 04:00:33,590
Like, it can be a non-lethal gun.

5024
04:00:33,770 --> 04:00:34,130
You know?

5025
04:00:34,470 --> 04:00:36,630
Like, it's a bullet that just stops, like...

5026
04:00:36,630 --> 04:00:39,050
That just, like, pinches the skin.

5027
04:00:39,310 --> 04:00:40,610
And it hurts a little bit.

5028
04:00:42,030 --> 04:00:43,410
Like, it stuns you.

5029
04:00:43,610 --> 04:00:44,670
Yeah, stun gun.

5030
04:00:45,530 --> 04:00:47,190
Stun guns aren't lethal!

5031
04:00:47,490 --> 04:00:49,070
Batman, why can't I have a bat-a-gun?

5032
04:00:49,770 --> 04:00:50,990
A bat-a-stun!

5033
04:00:52,610 --> 04:00:53,130
Yeah!

5034
04:00:55,750 --> 04:00:57,210
Stun guns aren't lethal!

5035
04:00:58,590 --> 04:00:59,370
That's different!

5036
04:01:06,670 --> 04:01:07,190
Alright.

5037
04:01:07,410 --> 04:01:09,670
Is there anything here that I need to look at?

5038
04:01:10,270 --> 04:01:10,790
Ooh!

5039
04:01:10,910 --> 04:01:11,430
The Riller.

5040
04:01:12,170 --> 04:01:14,950
You do know how to read a map, don't you?

5041
04:01:14,950 --> 04:01:16,250
Um...

5042
04:01:16,670 --> 04:01:18,050
Okay, actually, maybe not.

5043
04:01:22,710 --> 04:01:24,210
Mmm... Good question!

5044
04:01:24,490 --> 04:01:25,830
Good question!

5045
04:01:27,190 --> 04:01:27,870
Here?

5046
04:01:31,690 --> 04:01:32,690
Yeah, it's here.

5047
04:01:35,890 --> 04:01:37,870
What a great question.

5048
04:01:38,190 --> 04:01:38,890
Wait, what?

5049
04:01:39,010 --> 04:01:39,750
Where am I?

5050
04:01:40,970 --> 04:01:41,650
Whoa!

5051
04:02:23,160 --> 04:02:24,840
I'm in cash.

5052
04:02:25,900 --> 04:02:26,740
And you?

5053
04:02:27,420 --> 04:02:28,200
In your dream.

5054
04:02:28,600 --> 04:02:29,260
Not you.

5055
04:02:29,820 --> 04:02:30,240
Now.

5056
04:02:30,480 --> 04:02:34,860
I don't think, like... I feel like as a guard, you would want to be, like, nice to them.

5057
04:02:35,140 --> 04:02:37,620
So, like, because, like, they're always breaking out, right?

5058
04:02:38,020 --> 04:02:39,360
So they're always breaking...

5059
04:02:39,360 --> 04:02:40,520
You know they're always breaking out.

5060
04:02:40,620 --> 04:02:42,120
There's no, like, if they break out.

5061
04:02:42,180 --> 04:02:44,020
It's, like, whenever they do break out.

5062
04:02:44,160 --> 04:02:47,380
So, like, I feel like at that point, you'd want to be nice to them.

5063
04:02:49,580 --> 04:02:50,420
So, like...

5064
04:02:50,420 --> 04:02:51,540
So, like...

5065
04:02:51,540 --> 04:02:56,560
So, why would you, like, you know, be antagonistic to them when you know they're gonna fucking break out?

5066
04:02:57,260 --> 04:02:57,740
Like...

5067
04:03:02,360 --> 04:03:02,840
Like...

5068
04:03:03,940 --> 04:03:05,960
All I'm saying...

5069
04:03:05,960 --> 04:03:08,360
is that eventually...

5070
04:03:10,000 --> 04:03:11,820
Eventually they're gonna get out.

5071
04:03:12,100 --> 04:03:13,120
My game crashed.

5072
04:03:19,600 --> 04:03:23,020
So, like, why would you ever be, like, antagonistic to them?

5073
04:03:23,040 --> 04:03:23,480
Why would you be antagonistic to the villains?

5074
04:03:27,620 --> 04:03:27,980
What?

5075
04:03:28,860 --> 04:03:29,220
Okay.

5076
04:03:29,220 --> 04:03:31,840
But, like, if you're more mean to them, then they'll be...

5077
04:03:31,840 --> 04:03:34,880
Like, they're gonna, like, you know, they're gonna kill you anyway.

5078
04:03:35,200 --> 04:03:35,440
Okay.

5079
04:03:35,480 --> 04:03:38,180
So, like, you're going and thinking these villains are gonna kill you anyway.

5080
04:03:38,480 --> 04:03:42,800
But, like, if you're, like, extra mean to them, then they're gonna make it more painful.

5081
04:03:43,220 --> 04:03:44,500
More slow and painful.

5082
04:03:44,940 --> 04:03:45,420
You know?

5083
04:03:45,640 --> 04:03:47,660
So if you're nice to them, they'll be like, you know what?

5084
04:03:47,700 --> 04:03:48,560
You were nice to me.

5085
04:03:49,880 --> 04:03:51,160
We'll let it end quick.

5086
04:03:51,400 --> 04:03:51,700
You know?

5087
04:03:52,920 --> 04:03:53,980
It'll be quick.

5088
04:03:55,580 --> 04:03:59,680
But instead, because Cash was being a crock, now he doesn't have a hand.

5089
04:04:13,530 --> 04:04:14,050
Huh?

5090
04:04:17,370 --> 04:04:19,770
I feel like the water's already tainted.

5091
04:04:19,910 --> 04:04:21,430
The amount of Joker shit in there.

5092
04:04:29,950 --> 04:04:31,810
Oh no, not the water.

5093
04:04:37,050 --> 04:04:37,790
Oh shit!

5094
04:04:41,050 --> 04:04:42,190
Wait, so can I eat him?

5095
04:04:43,810 --> 04:04:44,210
Oh!

5096
04:04:53,280 --> 04:04:55,540
Making access to the killer crocs there.

5097
04:04:55,680 --> 04:04:56,180
Where is that?

5098
04:04:56,620 --> 04:04:57,400
Okay, it's this way.

5099
04:04:58,780 --> 04:04:59,360
Oh my.

5100
04:04:59,440 --> 04:05:01,160
Okay, I don't think he can breathe down there.

5101
04:05:01,320 --> 04:05:02,640
So, like, he couldn't be...

5102
04:05:02,640 --> 04:05:03,980
He might as well be dead.

5103
04:05:05,560 --> 04:05:06,300
I don't know.

5104
04:05:06,340 --> 04:05:09,980
I don't know if he could actually, like, breathe down... like...

5105
04:05:11,140 --> 04:05:11,920
I don't know.

5106
04:05:12,080 --> 04:05:12,340
No!

5107
04:05:12,700 --> 04:05:14,300
I can't swim?

5108
04:05:16,220 --> 04:05:18,200
What are you, fucking Sonic?

5109
04:05:22,920 --> 04:05:24,320
God damn it.

5110
04:05:24,360 --> 04:05:25,620
I can't swim, guys.

5111
04:05:27,460 --> 04:05:28,840
Why can't you swim?

5112
04:05:35,100 --> 04:05:38,080
Perfect time for the underwear gas mask.

5113
04:05:38,500 --> 04:05:40,420
Thank you for the super chat, Jonathan.

5114
04:05:40,680 --> 04:05:41,780
Thank you, thank you.

5115
04:05:41,980 --> 04:05:44,980
What's the point if you can't swim, Batman?

5116
04:05:44,980 --> 04:05:49,320
This is why Aquaman's on the team?

5117
04:05:49,720 --> 04:05:52,300
Is he your, like, token swim boy?

5118
04:05:54,300 --> 04:05:56,220
Can't swim so you got Aquaman?

5119
04:05:59,620 --> 04:06:02,640
He's carrying too much muscle, Doki.

5120
04:06:02,780 --> 04:06:03,500
You don't understand.

5121
04:06:17,600 --> 04:06:18,940
There's nothing on record.

5122
04:06:19,240 --> 04:06:21,380
Bruce, are you sure about this?

5123
04:06:21,700 --> 04:06:23,120
Sounds like a suicide mission.

5124
04:06:23,260 --> 04:06:24,660
Holy shit, Doki.

5125
04:06:24,680 --> 04:06:28,780
No one cares about Aquaman until the Aquaman move... until, like...

5126
04:06:28,780 --> 04:06:29,580
What's his name?

5127
04:06:29,820 --> 04:06:32,140
Jason Samoa fucking played Aquaman?

5128
04:06:32,540 --> 04:06:33,540
Croc's just an animal.

5129
04:06:33,800 --> 04:06:36,500
And animals just need traps and the right bait.

5130
04:06:36,700 --> 04:06:37,680
I'll be fine.

5131
04:06:38,720 --> 04:06:40,700
Oh shit, that's a bigger fucking...

5132
04:06:41,560 --> 04:06:42,160
Okay.

5133
04:06:43,980 --> 04:06:44,580
Alright.

5134
04:06:46,960 --> 04:06:48,280
Oh, sorry, Momoa.

5135
04:06:48,500 --> 04:06:48,900
I'm sorry.

5136
04:06:50,420 --> 04:06:51,580
Jason Momoa.

5137
04:06:52,280 --> 04:06:53,940
Jason Momoa.

5138
04:06:53,980 --> 04:06:55,580
Giving away my position to Croc.

5139
04:06:55,620 --> 04:06:57,580
I'll need to move as slowly as possible.

5140
04:07:02,140 --> 04:07:03,440
Whoa, where is he?

5141
04:07:03,860 --> 04:07:08,220
But all I'm saying, no one cared about him until Jason Momoa was...

5142
04:07:08,220 --> 04:07:11,320
Until Jason Momoa was Batman.

5143
04:07:11,880 --> 04:07:13,080
Not Batman, was...

5144
04:07:13,080 --> 04:07:14,160
Was Aquaman.

5145
04:07:16,100 --> 04:07:16,700
But I'm saying,

5146
04:07:24,160 --> 04:07:25,020
I'll be fine.

5147
04:07:25,140 --> 04:07:25,400
I'll be fine.

5148
04:07:25,400 --> 04:07:26,200
What's he gonna do?

5149
04:07:26,260 --> 04:07:26,600
Eat me?

5150
04:07:34,720 --> 04:07:36,540
Poop, poop, poop, poop, poop, poop, poop, poop.

5151
04:07:36,580 --> 04:07:38,420
You want... I remember he wanted to, like...

5152
04:07:38,420 --> 04:07:40,220
He was auditioning for another...

5153
04:07:43,810 --> 04:07:44,230
Hello?

5154
04:07:44,650 --> 04:07:45,310
Am I back?

5155
04:07:46,530 --> 04:07:47,690
Oh no, I'm refreshing.

5156
04:07:48,210 --> 04:07:48,630
I'm...

5157
04:07:51,870 --> 04:07:53,910
I don't know if I'm back.

5158
04:07:56,930 --> 04:07:57,670
But okay!

5159
04:07:57,910 --> 04:07:58,770
Okay, give me a sec.

5160
04:07:58,830 --> 04:07:59,510
I need a...

5161
04:07:59,730 --> 04:08:01,130
Guys!

5162
04:08:01,430 --> 04:08:03,590
I have to... I'm on WiFi.

5163
04:08:04,090 --> 04:08:06,110
I don't know...

5164
04:08:06,110 --> 04:08:07,390
I don't know...

5165
04:08:07,390 --> 04:08:09,650
I don't know...

5166
04:08:09,650 --> 04:08:11,330
If like...

5167
04:08:11,330 --> 04:08:15,670
I don't know what's going on with my... with my connection.

5168
04:08:16,290 --> 04:08:17,810
I'm on WiFi now.

5169
04:08:21,270 --> 04:08:22,630
Oh my god.

5170
04:08:22,950 --> 04:08:25,350
I can't believe I'm on WiFi.

5171
04:08:25,790 --> 04:08:27,090
Holy shit.

5172
04:08:27,470 --> 04:08:28,850
Oh my god.

5173
04:08:29,870 --> 04:08:31,030
Give me a sec.

5174
04:08:31,150 --> 04:08:31,670
I'm trying to...

5175
04:08:31,670 --> 04:08:34,070
I'm not... I'm not alive.

5176
04:08:34,330 --> 04:08:36,410
On screen right now.

5177
04:08:37,570 --> 04:08:39,070
I'm on WiFi right now.

5178
04:08:39,110 --> 04:08:40,750
So give me a sec, everybody.

5179
04:08:41,450 --> 04:08:42,610
Give me a sec.

5180
04:08:43,550 --> 04:08:44,930
Holy shit.

5181
04:08:46,150 --> 04:08:48,310
I can't believe I'm on WiFi.

5182
04:08:48,750 --> 04:08:52,370
I can't believe I've been on WiFi in fucking forever.

5183
04:08:52,930 --> 04:08:54,270
Holy shit.

5184
04:08:54,670 --> 04:08:56,050
Alright, let's see.

5185
04:08:57,450 --> 04:08:58,930
Alright, let's see.

5186
04:08:59,730 --> 04:09:00,210
I'm connecting.

5187
04:09:00,810 --> 04:09:01,510
Please.

5188
04:09:02,310 --> 04:09:03,010
Connect.

5189
04:09:03,970 --> 04:09:05,050
How could I?

5190
04:09:05,130 --> 04:09:06,650
What do you mean I can't connect?

5191
04:09:07,330 --> 04:09:08,670
What do you mean?

5192
04:09:09,230 --> 04:09:10,990
Imagine thinking of Super Chat.

5193
04:09:11,070 --> 04:09:11,410
Thank you.

5194
04:09:11,450 --> 04:09:11,710
Thank you.

5195
04:09:11,850 --> 04:09:15,090
Maybe the WiFi is the ransom mail.

5196
04:09:15,230 --> 04:09:17,850
I can't believe I'm on fucking WiFi.

5197
04:09:21,370 --> 04:09:22,670
Holy shit.

5198
04:09:23,490 --> 04:09:25,010
Oh my god.

5199
04:09:26,510 --> 04:09:27,210
Alright.

5200
04:09:27,210 --> 04:09:28,670
How do I do this?

5201
04:09:30,990 --> 04:09:31,670
Connect.

5202
04:09:32,870 --> 04:09:33,550
Connect.

5203
04:09:33,730 --> 04:09:35,310
Why are you not connecting?

5204
04:09:35,490 --> 04:09:36,810
Is it because I'm on WiFi?

5205
04:09:38,270 --> 04:09:38,950
Guys.

5206
04:09:39,110 --> 04:09:40,950
I'm trying to figure this out.

5207
04:09:41,250 --> 04:09:47,670
This is Jason Momoa's doing it all because I talked about Jason Momoa.

5208
04:09:49,610 --> 04:09:51,890
I blame Jason Momoa.

5209
04:09:52,190 --> 04:09:53,350
I fucking blame him.

5210
04:09:54,070 --> 04:09:55,090
It's all...

5211
04:09:55,090 --> 04:09:56,510
It's his fucking fault.

5212
04:09:56,670 --> 04:09:57,350
What the fuck?

5213
04:09:57,490 --> 04:10:00,130
What happened to my direct connection?

5214
04:10:01,910 --> 04:10:03,850
What actually happened?

5215
04:10:04,950 --> 04:10:05,250
Bro!

5216
04:10:07,370 --> 04:10:09,570
Why can't I connect with a PC?

5217
04:10:14,750 --> 04:10:15,350
Bro!

5218
04:10:15,530 --> 04:10:16,570
What do you mean?

5219
04:10:18,330 --> 04:10:19,510
What do you mean?

5220
04:10:20,310 --> 04:10:22,690
What do you mean I can't connect to this?

5221
04:10:23,310 --> 04:10:24,710
What is my...

5222
04:10:25,730 --> 04:10:26,330
Alright.

5223
04:10:26,330 --> 04:10:27,190
Let's see.

5224
04:10:27,210 --> 04:10:28,610
What the fuck is this?

5225
04:10:29,150 --> 04:10:29,790
Okay.

5226
04:10:30,210 --> 04:10:30,850
Alright.

5227
04:10:30,930 --> 04:10:33,170
Maybe if I change my thing here.

5228
04:10:33,490 --> 04:10:34,110
Guys.

5229
04:10:34,190 --> 04:10:36,410
Technical difficulties right now.

5230
04:10:36,590 --> 04:10:40,090
We are experiencing some turbulence at the moment.

5231
04:10:40,350 --> 04:10:40,790
So...

5232
04:10:40,790 --> 04:10:41,830
Give me a sec.

5233
04:10:45,330 --> 04:10:45,970
Oh!

5234
04:10:46,150 --> 04:10:46,790
I'm alive!

5235
04:10:47,110 --> 04:10:48,250
There we go.

5236
04:10:48,470 --> 04:10:49,790
I figured it out.

5237
04:10:49,830 --> 04:10:51,110
It's WiFi gaming time.

5238
04:10:51,390 --> 04:10:54,330
It's WiFi gaming time.

5239
04:10:54,330 --> 04:10:56,870
I can't believe I'm on WiFi now.

5240
04:10:59,190 --> 04:10:59,830
Alright.

5241
04:10:59,850 --> 04:11:00,870
Here we go.

5242
04:11:02,530 --> 04:11:03,170
Alright.

5243
04:11:03,170 --> 04:11:04,750
I am on WiFi.

5244
04:11:06,110 --> 04:11:08,310
Let's hope that this will be okay.

5245
04:11:09,490 --> 04:11:10,130
Oh!

5246
04:11:10,130 --> 04:11:11,310
Why you told me to run?

5247
04:11:11,630 --> 04:11:12,810
What the fuck?

5248
04:11:15,800 --> 04:11:17,960
I forgot about running.

5249
04:11:20,020 --> 04:11:24,360
Oh my god.

5250
04:11:24,880 --> 04:11:26,380
I don't know what... what...

5251
04:11:26,660 --> 04:11:27,100
what went wrong.

5252
04:11:27,200 --> 04:11:29,400
But we are going to be WiFi gamers until we...

5253
04:11:29,400 --> 04:11:33,960
Until my direct connection comes back.

5254
04:11:34,520 --> 04:11:35,000
Alright.

5255
04:11:35,180 --> 04:11:35,820
Where am I?

5256
04:11:36,360 --> 04:11:37,200
Where am I?

5257
04:11:39,120 --> 04:11:39,600
Here?

5258
04:11:41,680 --> 04:11:43,140
I'm going to go here, right?

5259
04:11:44,000 --> 04:11:44,480
No.

5260
04:11:44,520 --> 04:11:45,040
I go here.

5261
04:11:47,600 --> 04:11:48,540
We go here.

5262
04:11:50,600 --> 04:11:51,080
Okay.

5263
04:11:51,080 --> 04:11:51,660
I have to run again.

5264
04:11:54,320 --> 04:11:54,760
Yep.

5265
04:11:54,760 --> 04:11:55,200
Yep.

5266
04:11:55,320 --> 04:11:55,640
Yep.

5267
04:11:55,660 --> 04:11:55,960
Yep.

5268
04:11:55,960 --> 04:11:56,240
Yep.

5269
04:11:56,240 --> 04:11:56,560
Yep.

5270
04:11:56,720 --> 04:11:57,160
Yep.

5271
04:11:57,200 --> 04:11:57,300
Yep.

5272
04:11:57,300 --> 04:11:57,960
Here I go.

5273
04:11:58,920 --> 04:11:59,360
Alright.

5274
04:11:59,460 --> 04:11:59,880
Don't worry.

5275
04:11:59,940 --> 04:12:01,780
I'll... I'll fucking fix chat later.

5276
04:12:01,860 --> 04:12:03,580
There were so many things going around.

5277
04:12:04,720 --> 04:12:06,360
It's WiFi meta now.

5278
04:12:08,760 --> 04:12:09,200
Okay.

5279
04:12:09,360 --> 04:12:09,900
It's okay.

5280
04:12:09,980 --> 04:12:10,380
It's okay.

5281
04:12:11,060 --> 04:12:11,760
It's okay.

5282
04:12:11,900 --> 04:12:12,320
It's okay.

5283
04:12:13,540 --> 04:12:14,800
Throw a batteram.

5284
04:12:14,800 --> 04:12:16,280
Why do I need to throw a batteram?

5285
04:12:16,660 --> 04:12:17,100
Why?

5286
04:12:19,220 --> 04:12:19,660
Okay.

5287
04:12:20,100 --> 04:12:21,220
That's not a batteram.

5288
04:12:21,660 --> 04:12:22,600
That's not a batteram.

5289
04:12:22,600 --> 04:12:23,540
That's not a batteram!

5290
04:12:33,130 --> 04:12:35,030
I kept looking at my...

5291
04:12:35,590 --> 04:12:36,170
That's a good thing.

5292
04:12:36,250 --> 04:12:36,690
It's a good thing.

5293
04:12:36,750 --> 04:12:37,510
Because then that means...

5294
04:12:37,510 --> 04:12:39,650
Because then that means I can fix the chat.

5295
04:12:39,790 --> 04:12:40,050
You know?

5296
04:12:40,110 --> 04:12:41,590
That's what I wanted to do.

5297
04:12:41,950 --> 04:12:43,590
I wanted to fix chat.

5298
04:12:43,750 --> 04:12:44,010
Guys.

5299
04:12:44,150 --> 04:12:44,530
It's good.

5300
04:12:44,570 --> 04:12:44,910
It's good.

5301
04:12:45,270 --> 04:12:45,910
It's alright.

5302
04:12:48,910 --> 04:12:49,310
Okay.

5303
04:12:51,350 --> 04:12:52,090
We're back.

5304
04:12:52,130 --> 04:12:52,650
We're back.

5305
04:12:52,950 --> 04:12:55,650
We're fucking back.

5306
04:12:56,930 --> 04:12:57,330
Oh.

5307
04:12:57,330 --> 04:12:57,730
Whoops.

5308
04:12:59,750 --> 04:13:00,250
Okay.

5309
04:13:00,750 --> 04:13:01,270
Nice.

5310
04:13:03,170 --> 04:13:04,070
We did it.

5311
04:13:05,950 --> 04:13:06,830
There we go.

5312
04:13:06,890 --> 04:13:07,730
I figured it out.

5313
04:13:07,810 --> 04:13:08,210
Guys.

5314
04:13:08,270 --> 04:13:09,170
I figured it out.

5315
04:13:13,070 --> 04:13:14,090
Here we go.

5316
04:13:14,890 --> 04:13:15,410
Here we go.

5317
04:13:15,410 --> 04:13:16,290
Here we go.

5318
04:13:16,290 --> 04:13:16,910
Everything is fine.

5319
04:13:18,090 --> 04:13:19,750
We figured it all out.

5320
04:13:19,870 --> 04:13:21,290
Nothing to worry about.

5321
04:13:23,590 --> 04:13:25,070
Like we never left.

5322
04:13:26,770 --> 04:13:27,710
There we go.

5323
04:13:27,870 --> 04:13:28,390
There we go.

5324
04:13:29,090 --> 04:13:29,610
Easy.

5325
04:13:30,970 --> 04:13:32,550
So easy.

5326
04:13:33,610 --> 04:13:34,670
Back computer.

5327
04:13:34,790 --> 04:13:36,270
Everything is gold.

5328
04:13:36,710 --> 04:13:39,350
It's like anything wrong can happen.

5329
04:13:39,510 --> 04:13:40,310
That's happening.

5330
04:13:40,310 --> 04:13:41,230
It's happening today.

5331
04:13:45,330 --> 04:13:45,770
Nice.

5332
04:13:46,530 --> 04:13:48,150
Let me gather this.

5333
04:13:52,920 --> 04:13:55,600
My computer is slowly dying.

5334
04:13:56,040 --> 04:13:58,840
My internet is slowly dying too.

5335
04:13:58,980 --> 04:14:02,340
My internet

5336
04:14:05,820 --> 04:14:05,820
is slowly dying too.

5337
04:14:05,820 --> 04:14:07,020
We're here for the ride.

5338
04:14:07,570 --> 04:14:09,520
Am I halfway through this game yet?

5339
04:14:13,850 --> 04:14:15,870
Murphy's Law and Fall in fact.

5340
04:14:18,550 --> 04:14:19,130
Oh.

5341
04:14:19,150 --> 04:14:19,410
There it is.

5342
04:14:19,530 --> 04:14:19,850
Right here.

5343
04:14:21,330 --> 04:14:21,910
Wait.

5344
04:14:21,970 --> 04:14:22,290
What?

5345
04:14:24,230 --> 04:14:24,810
Oh.

5346
04:14:25,370 --> 04:14:25,950
Oh.

5347
04:14:26,230 --> 04:14:27,690
What do you mean?

5348
04:14:27,830 --> 04:14:28,110
I missed.

5349
04:14:31,680 --> 04:14:32,260
Curve.

5350
04:14:32,260 --> 04:14:32,800
Batman.

5351
04:14:33,020 --> 04:14:34,620
Why did it curve, Batman?

5352
04:14:34,900 --> 04:14:36,260
Why did it curve?

5353
04:14:36,260 --> 04:14:38,260
Why did it curve?

5354
04:14:42,380 --> 04:14:43,200
Why the fuck?

5355
04:14:43,560 --> 04:14:45,920
You don't need to curve the bullet.

5356
04:14:52,790 --> 04:14:53,470
Wait.

5357
04:14:53,470 --> 04:14:54,830
What is this behind me?

5358
04:14:55,150 --> 04:14:55,830
Okay.

5359
04:14:56,530 --> 04:14:57,490
There we go.

5360
04:15:00,410 --> 04:15:03,590
Doctor says it's normal to curve.

5361
04:15:06,890 --> 04:15:07,570
Okay.

5362
04:15:07,670 --> 04:15:07,950
Nice.

5363
04:15:11,740 --> 04:15:13,740
I actually don't even know how much...

5364
04:15:13,740 --> 04:15:15,560
You guys are giving me so many conflicting answers.

5365
04:15:15,640 --> 04:15:17,500
I actually don't even know how much I have left.

5366
04:15:22,940 --> 04:15:23,340
Okay.

5367
04:15:25,060 --> 04:15:25,820
There we go.

5368
04:15:25,940 --> 04:15:26,900
Oh my god.

5369
04:15:29,840 --> 04:15:30,240
Alright.

5370
04:15:30,280 --> 04:15:30,600
There you go.

5371
04:15:30,660 --> 04:15:32,180
I trust my doctor.

5372
04:15:35,000 --> 04:15:36,520
I feel like I can just crouch walk.

5373
04:15:36,580 --> 04:15:37,100
It's faster.

5374
04:15:39,600 --> 04:15:40,620
There you go.

5375
04:15:41,780 --> 04:15:43,160
Let me say my percent, doctor.

5376
04:15:43,180 --> 04:15:43,420
Wait.

5377
04:15:43,520 --> 04:15:44,640
I can actually finish this today.

5378
04:15:48,110 --> 04:15:48,570
Okay.

5379
04:15:49,450 --> 04:15:50,370
Thank god.

5380
04:15:52,790 --> 04:15:54,610
Technically I can finish this today.

5381
04:15:54,710 --> 04:15:55,870
If it's 75%.

5382
04:16:03,010 --> 04:16:03,470
Alright.

5383
04:16:03,510 --> 04:16:04,550
We're in it for the long haul.

5384
04:16:06,030 --> 04:16:08,250
We went through so many things together, guys.

5385
04:16:10,370 --> 04:16:10,830
We went through so many things together, guys.

5386
04:16:10,830 --> 04:16:11,690
Why did he go that way?

5387
04:16:12,110 --> 04:16:12,170
Why did he go that way?

5388
04:16:16,220 --> 04:16:16,680
Okay.

5389
04:16:17,820 --> 04:16:18,280
Okay.

5390
04:16:24,580 --> 04:16:24,980
Okay.

5391
04:16:26,240 --> 04:16:26,640
Okay.

5392
04:16:27,080 --> 04:16:27,380
Okay.

5393
04:16:27,380 --> 04:16:27,940
I was like, why?

5394
04:16:28,240 --> 04:16:33,990
I mean, that's fine.

5395
04:16:35,330 --> 04:16:35,730
Yeah.

5396
04:16:35,810 --> 04:16:37,530
I was like, why did he go that way?

5397
04:16:39,310 --> 04:16:39,770
Got her.

5398
04:16:44,460 --> 04:16:45,340
Hey, what is that?

5399
04:16:45,380 --> 04:16:45,940
Is he stupid?

5400
04:16:52,260 --> 04:16:52,660
Alright.

5401
04:16:53,700 --> 04:16:54,300
Come on.

5402
04:16:54,340 --> 04:16:54,900
Face me.

5403
04:16:57,140 --> 04:16:57,560
Nice.

5404
04:16:57,720 --> 04:16:58,140
No.

5405
04:16:58,260 --> 04:16:58,660
No.

5406
04:16:58,720 --> 04:16:59,000
No.

5407
04:16:59,120 --> 04:16:59,240
No.

5408
04:16:59,280 --> 04:16:59,420
No.

5409
04:16:59,420 --> 04:16:59,600
No.

5410
04:16:59,600 --> 04:17:02,080
I thought he was going to take me back into the pit.

5411
04:17:04,820 --> 04:17:05,240
Alright.

5412
04:17:05,760 --> 04:17:06,180
Yay.

5413
04:17:11,370 --> 04:17:12,030
This way.

5414
04:17:12,990 --> 04:17:13,410
What?

5415
04:17:13,450 --> 04:17:14,350
Not this way?

5416
04:17:14,570 --> 04:17:16,210
I can find you, Batman.

5417
04:17:17,150 --> 04:17:18,410
I mean, it's not that hard.

5418
04:17:19,450 --> 04:17:19,870
Oh.

5419
04:17:20,470 --> 04:17:20,890
Boop.

5420
04:17:23,670 --> 04:17:24,290
This way.

5421
04:17:26,790 --> 04:17:28,050
I'm just going to cut this real quick.

5422
04:17:28,070 --> 04:17:30,430
I mean, it's not that difficult to find me.

5423
04:17:30,450 --> 04:17:32,710
Just like poke your head out a little bit and you'll see me.

5424
04:17:37,110 --> 04:17:37,770
Oh no.

5425
04:17:40,170 --> 04:17:41,370
What is he going to do?

5426
04:17:41,450 --> 04:17:42,810
Fucking come up and bite me?

5427
04:17:44,370 --> 04:17:46,130
He smells my Wi-Fi connection.

5428
04:17:51,750 --> 04:17:54,110
I guess I use the...

5429
04:17:54,110 --> 04:17:55,430
I use this?

5430
04:17:56,710 --> 04:17:57,150
Hmmmm.

5431
04:17:58,990 --> 04:18:00,170
I guess I use the...

5432
04:18:00,170 --> 04:18:00,190
Hmmmm.

5433
04:18:00,390 --> 04:18:00,570
I guess I use the...

5434
04:18:00,570 --> 04:18:00,810
Okay.

5435
04:18:04,600 --> 04:18:05,000
Wait.

5436
04:18:05,060 --> 04:18:05,960
Hold A to run.

5437
04:18:06,240 --> 04:18:06,640
Why?

5438
04:18:06,860 --> 04:18:07,260
Why?

5439
04:18:07,440 --> 04:18:07,840
Why?

5440
04:18:08,300 --> 04:18:08,940
Which way?

5441
04:18:09,420 --> 04:18:10,060
Which way?

5442
04:18:10,320 --> 04:18:12,020
Am I going the right way?

5443
04:18:15,560 --> 04:18:15,960
Oh.

5444
04:18:15,960 --> 04:18:16,360
Okay.

5445
04:18:17,480 --> 04:18:19,020
I was like, What do you mean run?

5446
04:18:23,470 --> 04:18:23,870
Where?

5447
04:18:24,150 --> 04:18:24,550
Where?

5448
04:18:24,730 --> 04:18:25,130
Where?

5449
04:18:25,270 --> 04:18:25,790
Oh there.

5450
04:18:27,110 --> 04:18:27,510
No!

5451
04:18:27,570 --> 04:18:28,010
Oh shit!

5452
04:18:28,050 --> 04:18:28,230
Okay.

5453
04:18:28,290 --> 04:18:28,570
It hit it.

5454
04:18:28,610 --> 04:18:28,750
Okay.

5455
04:18:28,810 --> 04:18:30,710
I was going to be like, where did my batarang...

5456
04:18:30,710 --> 04:18:31,150
Okay.

5457
04:18:31,190 --> 04:18:33,450
My batarang hit the wall, but it still counted.

5458
04:18:33,650 --> 04:18:34,290
That's okay.

5459
04:18:34,650 --> 04:18:35,730
I take those.

5460
04:18:36,910 --> 04:18:37,350
What?

5461
04:18:37,430 --> 04:18:37,790
Run?

5462
04:18:37,910 --> 04:18:38,190
Run?

5463
04:18:38,290 --> 04:18:38,570
No!

5464
04:18:38,650 --> 04:18:40,230
No no no no no no no no no no no no no!

5465
04:18:43,490 --> 04:18:43,930
Okay.

5466
04:18:46,470 --> 04:18:47,070
This way.

5467
04:18:47,730 --> 04:18:48,670
Oh my god.

5468
04:18:48,710 --> 04:18:49,510
This is so scary.

5469
04:18:50,470 --> 04:18:52,070
I'm so paranoid right now.

5470
04:18:52,810 --> 04:18:54,610
He could come up at any time.

5471
04:18:57,130 --> 04:18:57,570
Okay.

5472
04:18:57,570 --> 04:18:57,930
Got her.

5473
04:19:00,770 --> 04:19:01,210
Nice.

5474
04:19:03,970 --> 04:19:04,530
Got her.

5475
04:19:04,570 --> 04:19:04,630
Yeah.

5476
04:19:04,650 --> 04:19:08,090
How much fucking spores do I have to get her?

5477
04:19:15,050 --> 04:19:15,610
Alright.

5478
04:19:16,870 --> 04:19:17,690
Oh thank god.

5479
04:19:19,730 --> 04:19:21,030
Thank fucking god.

5480
04:19:30,330 --> 04:19:30,890
Okay.

5481
04:19:37,130 --> 04:19:37,690
Nice.

5482
04:19:39,690 --> 04:19:41,250
Yeah, I don't think he'll be a problem.

5483
04:19:43,530 --> 04:19:44,910
You're right, Batman.

5484
04:19:45,310 --> 04:19:46,730
He doesn't see...

5485
04:19:46,730 --> 04:19:47,770
Whoa whoa whoa!

5486
04:19:48,410 --> 04:19:50,870
What the wrong way?

5487
04:19:52,620 --> 04:19:53,920
It was this way.

5488
04:19:55,220 --> 04:19:56,120
I think?

5489
04:19:57,840 --> 04:19:58,560
Yeah.

5490
04:19:58,720 --> 04:19:59,780
It's this way.

5491
04:20:01,920 --> 04:20:02,640
Wait.

5492
04:20:02,760 --> 04:20:03,060
Huh?

5493
04:20:06,200 --> 04:20:07,840
Please open that door!

5494
04:20:08,240 --> 04:20:08,840
For me!

5495
04:20:09,340 --> 04:20:10,260
Thank you!

5496
04:20:12,220 --> 04:20:12,960
Thank you!

5497
04:20:12,960 --> 04:20:14,300
Thank you, I really appreciate that.

5498
04:20:15,920 --> 04:20:17,620
Thank you so... God damn it.

5499
04:20:18,140 --> 04:20:19,020
I hate these.

5500
04:20:20,820 --> 04:20:22,640
Alright, as I was saying...

5501
04:20:23,560 --> 04:20:25,460
Jason Momoa wanted to...

5502
04:20:25,460 --> 04:20:27,980
wanted to be a different guy.

5503
04:20:28,200 --> 04:20:29,360
Oh, he wanted to be...

5504
04:20:30,300 --> 04:20:31,160
What's his name?

5505
04:20:32,580 --> 04:20:33,440
Oh my god!

5506
04:20:34,000 --> 04:20:34,620
Oh shit!

5507
04:20:34,680 --> 04:20:35,300
No, no, no, no, no!

5508
04:20:35,380 --> 04:20:36,160
I'm trying to think!

5509
04:20:36,720 --> 04:20:39,300
He wanted to be this anti-hero guy.

5510
04:20:40,580 --> 04:20:41,540
What's his name?

5511
04:20:41,920 --> 04:20:42,700
He... he...

5512
04:20:43,880 --> 04:20:44,360
Lobo!

5513
04:20:44,360 --> 04:20:44,620
Yes!

5514
04:20:45,080 --> 04:20:46,960
He would make a really good Lobo.

5515
04:20:47,000 --> 04:20:48,440
He's a fucking nerd.

5516
04:20:51,040 --> 04:20:52,460
I didn't even realize...

5517
04:20:52,460 --> 04:20:54,720
Oh my god, these...

5518
04:20:55,600 --> 04:20:56,600
No, no, no, no, no, no!

5519
04:20:56,840 --> 04:20:58,480
He got the bad line!

5520
04:21:01,760 --> 04:21:03,260
No, I meant Jason.

5521
04:21:04,280 --> 04:21:05,920
He's actually a nerd.

5522
04:21:08,080 --> 04:21:09,420
And I'll do it again!

5523
04:21:10,260 --> 04:21:12,260
Jason Momoa, thank you for the Akasupa.

5524
04:21:12,260 --> 04:21:13,520
No, I didn't do...

5525
04:21:13,520 --> 04:21:15,180
Are you fucking kidding me?

5526
04:21:15,220 --> 04:21:17,120
I had to do this all the way from the beginning?

5527
04:21:19,000 --> 04:21:20,800
Fuck you, Jason Momoa!

5528
04:21:21,120 --> 04:21:22,680
But thank you for the Akasupa.

5529
04:21:23,380 --> 04:21:24,740
You're an Akasupa.

5530
04:21:32,760 --> 04:21:34,220
Oh my god.

5531
04:21:34,720 --> 04:21:35,840
God damn it.

5532
04:21:37,440 --> 04:21:38,140
That's it.

5533
04:21:39,380 --> 04:21:40,560
Can't believe it.

5534
04:21:40,560 --> 04:21:43,160
I got fucked over because I had the line.

5535
04:21:45,400 --> 04:21:45,840
Alright.

5536
04:21:47,080 --> 04:21:47,900
I'm good now.

5537
04:21:49,200 --> 04:21:49,900
Everything's fine.

5538
04:21:50,280 --> 04:21:50,720
Okay.

5539
04:21:53,120 --> 04:21:54,500
That should be all the explosions.

5540
04:21:56,800 --> 04:22:00,020
Can't believe I had to do this all the way back from the beginning.

5541
04:22:02,700 --> 04:22:04,260
Where is he gonna pop up?

5542
04:22:04,800 --> 04:22:06,060
Where is he gonna pop up?

5543
04:22:06,080 --> 04:22:06,680
I'm so paranoid.

5544
04:22:07,720 --> 04:22:08,980
Where is he gonna pop up?

5545
04:22:08,980 --> 04:22:08,980
I'm so paranoid.

5546
04:22:08,980 --> 04:22:10,700
There you go.

5547
04:22:11,100 --> 04:22:12,420
Just in case.

5548
04:22:13,300 --> 04:22:14,540
God damn it.

5549
04:22:14,560 --> 04:22:15,300
I'm so far.

5550
04:22:15,420 --> 04:22:17,020
I still have 300 left!

5551
04:22:18,440 --> 04:22:19,220
Please!

5552
04:22:20,620 --> 04:22:23,460
Why can't I send my Batcave over?

5553
04:22:23,980 --> 04:22:25,500
Why can't I send my Batcave over?

5554
04:22:27,020 --> 04:22:27,800
Imagine.

5555
04:22:27,800 --> 04:22:29,140
My Batcar.

5556
04:22:29,440 --> 04:22:32,580
Just fucking grab my Batcar into the sewers.

5557
04:22:33,100 --> 04:22:33,640
Just fucking grab my Batcar into the sewers.

5558
04:22:34,770 --> 04:22:35,720
God damn it.

5559
04:22:37,260 --> 04:22:37,700
Okay.

5560
04:22:38,820 --> 04:22:39,920
Then I go...

5561
04:22:40,320 --> 04:22:40,760
Nope.

5562
04:22:41,020 --> 04:22:41,660
This way?

5563
04:22:41,940 --> 04:22:42,380
Okay.

5564
04:22:42,380 --> 04:22:42,800
It's this way.

5565
04:22:44,680 --> 04:22:45,120
No.

5566
04:22:45,600 --> 04:22:46,860
No no no no no!

5567
04:22:49,040 --> 04:22:49,700
This way.

5568
04:22:50,100 --> 04:22:50,540
Okay.

5569
04:22:50,580 --> 04:22:51,460
I'm retracing my steps.

5570
04:22:51,560 --> 04:22:52,200
I remember now.

5571
04:22:53,120 --> 04:22:54,280
I remember how to get back.

5572
04:22:57,140 --> 04:22:57,580
Nice.

5573
04:22:58,940 --> 04:22:59,380
Alright.

5574
04:23:00,340 --> 04:23:02,280
I remember exactly how to get back now.

5575
04:23:02,540 --> 04:23:02,980
Nope.

5576
04:23:03,480 --> 04:23:05,480
I remember exactly how to get back.

5577
04:23:05,720 --> 04:23:06,060
Now.

5578
04:23:08,840 --> 04:23:10,200
Now I do.

5579
04:23:10,480 --> 04:23:11,020
Now I do.

5580
04:23:14,290 --> 04:23:16,490
You can't run from me.

5581
04:23:17,110 --> 04:23:18,030
You can't run from me.

5582
04:23:19,230 --> 04:23:20,670
It's not gonna stop me from running.

5583
04:23:21,210 --> 04:23:22,910
That's not gonna stop me from running.

5584
04:23:24,250 --> 04:23:25,130
Oh my god.

5585
04:23:25,190 --> 04:23:26,110
It's Crash Bandicoot time.

5586
04:23:28,010 --> 04:23:29,470
Why did you stop, Bebe?

5587
04:23:29,770 --> 04:23:30,770
Why did you stop, Bebe?

5588
04:23:34,810 --> 04:23:35,370
Okay.

5589
04:23:35,470 --> 04:23:35,670
Okay.

5590
04:23:35,670 --> 04:23:35,870
Now.

5591
04:23:36,810 --> 04:23:38,010
Oh my god.

5592
04:23:38,430 --> 04:23:39,750
Batman is faster than the camera.

5593
04:23:39,850 --> 04:23:40,370
I hate this.

5594
04:23:42,050 --> 04:23:42,410
Okay.

5595
04:23:42,430 --> 04:23:42,650
We're good.

5596
04:23:42,730 --> 04:23:42,910
We're good.

5597
04:23:42,950 --> 04:23:43,270
We're good.

5598
04:23:43,350 --> 04:23:43,790
We're good.

5599
04:23:43,910 --> 04:23:44,130
Okay.

5600
04:23:47,510 --> 04:23:47,710
We're good.

5601
04:23:47,770 --> 04:23:48,010
We're good.

5602
04:23:48,070 --> 04:23:48,330
We're good.

5603
04:23:48,350 --> 04:23:48,430
We're good.

5604
04:23:48,430 --> 04:23:48,470
We're good.

5605
04:23:48,470 --> 04:23:48,470
We're good.

5606
04:23:48,470 --> 04:23:48,470
Oh.

5607
04:23:48,610 --> 04:23:49,110
We're not good.

5608
04:23:49,210 --> 04:23:49,670
We're not good.

5609
04:23:51,250 --> 04:23:51,850
We're not good.

5610
04:23:53,190 --> 04:23:53,930
We're not good.

5611
04:23:54,130 --> 04:23:54,490
It's okay.

5612
04:23:55,010 --> 04:23:56,270
I can time this perfectly.

5613
04:23:57,930 --> 04:23:58,290
Woo!

5614
04:24:00,490 --> 04:24:00,850
Nice.

5615
04:24:03,150 --> 04:24:05,670
I knew there was gonna be water underneath so it's not killing.

5616
04:24:05,670 --> 04:24:05,970
I'm feeling...

5617
04:24:09,210 --> 04:24:09,690
Nice!

5618
04:24:14,490 --> 04:24:14,970
Yay!

5619
04:24:15,610 --> 04:24:15,890
Alright.

5620
04:24:16,150 --> 04:24:19,010
I'm gonna take this as a win and I'm gonna use a bathroom break.

5621
04:24:19,110 --> 04:24:19,750
I'll be right back.

5622
04:24:21,410 --> 04:24:22,570
Where is this?

5623
04:24:24,090 --> 04:24:24,910
I am here.

5624
04:24:26,030 --> 04:24:27,290
This is the Batcave.

5625
04:24:27,530 --> 04:24:27,890
Alright.

5626
04:24:28,030 --> 04:24:30,830
I'm gonna take this as a win and go for a bathroom break.

5627
04:24:30,870 --> 04:24:31,670
I'll be right back guys.

5628
04:25:48,640 --> 04:25:49,600
I'm back!

5629
04:25:50,580 --> 04:25:54,100
Okay, who the fuck just said chat you wanna kiss by the sewer?

5630
04:25:54,520 --> 04:25:56,580
Please love yourself more.

5631
04:25:56,860 --> 04:25:58,360
What the fuck?

5632
04:25:59,200 --> 04:26:01,500
Please have some standards!

5633
04:26:02,500 --> 04:26:03,520
Holy shit!

5634
04:26:05,220 --> 04:26:05,760
Okay.

5635
04:26:07,020 --> 04:26:09,240
Guys, you need to have standards guys.

5636
04:26:10,040 --> 04:26:14,740
Cause then that- cause you're watching me and I assume you guys have high standards, right guys?

5637
04:26:15,140 --> 04:26:19,320
Cause if you have low standards and you're watching me, then that makes me a little sad.

5638
04:26:23,840 --> 04:26:29,860
I'm like, that says a lot of- Guys, you have high standards, right?

5639
04:26:30,760 --> 04:26:31,160
Guys!

5640
04:26:36,560 --> 04:26:37,780
Alright, what do we upgrade?

5641
04:26:40,080 --> 04:26:41,720
What's the next- I guess Bataran power.

5642
04:26:42,040 --> 04:26:42,360
You know what?

5643
04:26:42,360 --> 04:26:43,180
Yeah, Bataran power.

5644
04:26:43,880 --> 04:26:44,280
Okay.

5645
04:26:46,480 --> 04:26:47,920
Um... did I go the wrong way?

5646
04:26:48,180 --> 04:26:49,160
I went the wrong way.

5647
04:26:49,240 --> 04:26:49,780
Fuck, okay.

5648
04:26:49,900 --> 04:26:50,440
It's this way.

5649
04:26:51,500 --> 04:26:54,380
Yeah, just enough I think.

5650
04:26:55,660 --> 04:26:56,140
Guys!

5651
04:26:59,680 --> 04:27:00,500
Okay, this way.

5652
04:27:01,920 --> 04:27:02,400
Weeeeee!

5653
04:27:03,440 --> 04:27:04,780
It was not this way guys.

5654
04:27:05,020 --> 04:27:06,200
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

5655
04:27:06,280 --> 04:27:07,100
I'm cheesing the system?

5656
04:27:07,720 --> 04:27:08,720
I'm cheesing it?

5657
04:27:10,600 --> 04:27:12,060
I'm cheesing the system?

5658
04:27:12,220 --> 04:27:12,580
But...

5659
04:27:13,240 --> 04:27:13,720
Yay!

5660
04:27:14,860 --> 04:27:16,540
Maybe I'll- Yes!

5661
04:27:16,760 --> 04:27:17,500
I did it!

5662
04:27:18,340 --> 04:27:18,820
What?

5663
04:27:20,280 --> 04:27:20,780
Nice.

5664
04:27:20,980 --> 04:27:22,040
I cheesed it.

5665
04:27:22,920 --> 04:27:23,420
Perfectly.

5666
04:27:27,320 --> 04:27:27,820
Nice.

5667
04:27:27,820 --> 04:27:29,060
Perfectly cheesed.

5668
04:27:30,520 --> 04:27:32,080
As all things should be.

5669
04:27:35,040 --> 04:27:36,180
Alright, let's see.

5670
04:27:36,220 --> 04:27:36,760
Where do we go?

5671
04:27:37,820 --> 04:27:38,960
Oh, it's this place.

5672
04:27:40,060 --> 04:27:40,980
It's this way.

5673
04:27:41,740 --> 04:27:42,240
Alright.

5674
04:27:43,860 --> 04:27:45,160
Gotta go ahead this way.

5675
04:27:45,680 --> 04:27:46,460
Oh shit!

5676
04:27:46,520 --> 04:27:46,940
Hey guys!

5677
04:27:47,160 --> 04:27:47,580
Whoa!

5678
04:27:48,460 --> 04:27:48,860
Guys!

5679
04:27:49,080 --> 04:27:49,400
Guys!

5680
04:27:49,560 --> 04:27:50,040
Come on!

5681
04:27:51,120 --> 04:27:52,700
I have two batter-ends.

5682
04:27:52,880 --> 04:27:54,240
Oh, this is the wrong battering!

5683
04:27:55,340 --> 04:27:56,940
Now I have two batter-ends.

5684
04:27:56,940 --> 04:27:57,280
No!

5685
04:27:57,280 --> 04:27:58,280
This is the wrong one again!

5686
04:28:01,160 --> 04:28:02,080
Oh, damn it.

5687
04:28:02,280 --> 04:28:03,980
Let me just get rid of this guy.

5688
04:28:05,620 --> 04:28:06,260
Alright, nice.

5689
04:28:07,240 --> 04:28:09,120
And not see all of these people.

5690
04:28:10,360 --> 04:28:11,060
What's up guys?

5691
04:28:11,180 --> 04:28:12,400
Wait, you have a gun?

5692
04:28:13,060 --> 04:28:13,720
Oh my god.

5693
04:28:14,360 --> 04:28:14,940
Don't worry.

5694
04:28:15,340 --> 04:28:16,220
Dark Souls slide.

5695
04:28:16,400 --> 04:28:17,480
Oh, I'm gonna die.

5696
04:28:17,480 --> 04:28:17,560
I'm gonna die.

5697
04:28:18,500 --> 04:28:18,900
Awesome!

5698
04:28:18,940 --> 04:28:20,660
Joyboys, welcome to the tomato farm!

5699
04:28:20,740 --> 04:28:21,000
Welcome!

5700
04:28:21,060 --> 04:28:21,340
Welcome!

5701
04:28:23,080 --> 04:28:24,820
Detective, yes, we have standards.

5702
04:28:25,020 --> 04:28:27,120
What the fuck are you doing with this box?

5703
04:28:28,000 --> 04:28:29,540
Oh no, a toaster.

5704
04:28:29,860 --> 04:28:30,940
What will we do?

5705
04:28:31,180 --> 04:28:32,380
Oh no, he's grabbing the gun.

5706
04:28:32,880 --> 04:28:33,920
He's grabbing the gun.

5707
04:28:36,160 --> 04:28:36,560
Yeah.

5708
04:28:37,780 --> 04:28:39,420
Detective Shade, thank you for the super chat.

5709
04:28:39,480 --> 04:28:40,220
Thank you, thank you.

5710
04:28:40,480 --> 04:28:41,740
Yes, we have standards.

5711
04:28:41,980 --> 04:28:43,760
But if a homie asks for a kiss, need a serious?

5712
04:28:43,960 --> 04:28:45,860
And then the homie will get a kiss.

5713
04:28:45,920 --> 04:28:46,840
I'm serious.

5714
04:28:47,960 --> 04:28:50,080
Thank you for the super chat, Shane.

5715
04:28:50,140 --> 04:28:51,100
Thank you, thank you.

5716
04:28:51,180 --> 04:28:52,140
The plants are going crazy.

5717
04:28:52,380 --> 04:28:53,020
I'm getting...

5718
04:28:56,560 --> 04:28:57,180
It's okay.

5719
04:28:57,320 --> 04:28:58,540
I've got the mold samples.

5720
04:28:58,980 --> 04:29:01,000
I'm heading to the Batcave to mix up the antidote.

5721
04:29:01,000 --> 04:29:01,480
That's true.

5722
04:29:01,560 --> 04:29:02,720
You can't reject a homie.

5723
04:29:02,840 --> 04:29:04,360
I know you're in a hurry, but I'm sure you know what you're doing.

5724
04:29:07,730 --> 04:29:08,170
Bing.

5725
04:29:08,250 --> 04:29:14,150
Even a fan of $100 foie gras can enjoy a $12 bucket of...

5726
04:29:14,150 --> 04:29:15,590
I'm the foie gras, right?

5727
04:29:16,310 --> 04:29:20,850
I'm the duck you fucking force fed and then ate the liver of, right guys?

5728
04:29:25,210 --> 04:29:25,930
Right?

5729
04:29:29,870 --> 04:29:31,310
All right.

5730
04:29:31,510 --> 04:29:32,850
I am, right?

5731
04:29:37,050 --> 04:29:37,770
Guys.

5732
04:29:39,290 --> 04:29:40,190
Needa, no.

5733
04:29:40,590 --> 04:29:41,930
Scan and opus.

5734
04:29:50,440 --> 04:29:52,260
All right, this way.

5735
04:29:52,760 --> 04:29:54,380
I'm in the Batcave.

5736
04:29:55,220 --> 04:29:57,380
That's definitely not OSHA approved.

5737
04:29:57,640 --> 04:29:58,360
Oh, wow.

5738
04:29:59,260 --> 04:30:03,700
Where am I getting all this... is this where all the power bill went to?

5739
04:30:36,460 --> 04:30:37,240
Wait, you're right.

5740
04:30:37,280 --> 04:30:38,000
Who built this?

5741
04:30:39,080 --> 04:30:40,300
Wait, you guys are right!

5742
04:30:40,500 --> 04:30:42,220
Who the fuck built this?

5743
04:30:43,100 --> 04:30:45,020
Did it have like workers and the A?

5744
04:30:46,980 --> 04:30:48,360
Johnson, thank you for the super chat.

5745
04:30:48,440 --> 04:30:49,160
Thank you, thank you.

5746
04:30:49,160 --> 04:30:50,060
I just got back.

5747
04:30:50,720 --> 04:30:52,740
What in the world is going on right now?

5748
04:30:53,220 --> 04:30:56,800
Did my fucking... I swear to god, did my wifi die again?

5749
04:31:09,300 --> 04:31:10,400
No, we're still alive.

5750
04:31:10,880 --> 04:31:11,960
I'm just not alive.

5751
04:31:17,240 --> 04:31:19,000
Oh shit, I got an upgrade though.

5752
04:31:19,040 --> 04:31:20,060
Fires up to three claws.

5753
04:31:21,540 --> 04:31:24,820
I can't allow structural weaknesses to be pulled down remote.

5754
04:31:24,920 --> 04:31:26,320
Okay, give me a sec.

5755
04:31:26,460 --> 04:31:27,640
We're going through a lot today.

5756
04:31:34,760 --> 04:31:38,060
Batman is so... I used up all my luck in Power World, clearly.

5757
04:31:38,580 --> 04:31:43,560
I feel like at this point, I definitely used up all my luck in Power World.

5758
04:31:44,660 --> 04:31:47,620
Everything that could go wrong has gone wrong today.

5759
04:31:52,020 --> 04:31:53,240
Give me a sec.

5760
04:31:53,320 --> 04:31:55,140
I'm barely connecting right now.

5761
04:31:55,940 --> 04:31:57,040
Oh my god.

5762
04:31:57,860 --> 04:31:59,320
Guys, give me a sec.

5763
04:32:00,320 --> 04:32:01,760
We're going back in.

5764
04:32:02,160 --> 04:32:02,920
I think.

5765
04:32:02,920 --> 04:32:03,620
Connect.

5766
04:32:05,100 --> 04:32:05,860
Connect.

5767
04:32:07,580 --> 04:32:09,920
Yes, I am still on the wifi.

5768
04:32:10,520 --> 04:32:15,200
I am indeed still on the wifi right now.

5769
04:32:19,500 --> 04:32:22,240
It's been pretty rough today.

5770
04:32:23,140 --> 04:32:25,260
It's okay, I got third place.

5771
04:32:25,300 --> 04:32:26,060
Plus one.

5772
04:32:26,320 --> 04:32:27,660
In Power World.

5773
04:32:28,000 --> 04:32:29,080
It's something.

5774
04:32:31,720 --> 04:32:32,360
No!

5775
04:32:32,580 --> 04:32:33,560
I can't connect!

5776
04:32:34,300 --> 04:32:35,880
I don't understand!

5777
04:32:36,160 --> 04:32:38,860
How could the wifi do this to me?

5778
04:32:44,280 --> 04:32:45,580
Oh my god.

5779
04:32:47,760 --> 04:32:50,460
How could the wifi do this?

5780
04:32:51,900 --> 04:32:54,580
I've been nothing but great to the wifi!

5781
04:32:55,540 --> 04:32:58,860
Do I just use... Am I going to actually use my data?

5782
04:32:58,860 --> 04:32:59,740
Am I?

5783
04:33:06,540 --> 04:33:07,940
Oh my god.

5784
04:33:08,920 --> 04:33:11,500
I don't understand how they could do this to me.

5785
04:33:12,480 --> 04:33:13,000
Okay.

5786
04:33:13,080 --> 04:33:14,440
I've been nothing but...

5787
04:33:14,980 --> 04:33:18,160
I've been nothing but like amazing to my PC.

5788
04:33:19,520 --> 04:33:20,920
What have I done wrong?

5789
04:33:22,020 --> 04:33:22,540
Okay.

5790
04:33:22,900 --> 04:33:25,600
I need to make sure I don't accidentally read out my IP.

5791
04:33:25,760 --> 04:33:26,040
Okay.

5792
04:33:28,360 --> 04:33:29,480
I'm like...

5793
04:33:29,480 --> 04:33:29,960
I'm like...

5794
04:33:29,960 --> 04:33:30,380
Okay, Doki.

5795
04:33:30,500 --> 04:33:33,300
Do not read this out when you're typing this in.

5796
04:33:33,700 --> 04:33:36,940
Wifi giveth and wifi taketh.

5797
04:33:37,160 --> 04:33:38,540
I don't understand.

5798
04:33:39,980 --> 04:33:42,520
How could this happen to me?

5799
04:33:43,980 --> 04:33:46,580
I just want to beat Batman!

5800
04:33:48,920 --> 04:33:49,640
Please!

5801
04:33:50,360 --> 04:33:52,720
Just let me beat the game!

5802
04:33:53,160 --> 04:33:56,020
I'm so close to beating the game!

5803
04:34:02,640 --> 04:34:03,880
At least we...

5804
04:34:03,880 --> 04:34:05,660
You know, at least we stopped at a good point.

5805
04:34:05,860 --> 04:34:06,220
You know?

5806
04:34:06,260 --> 04:34:07,820
At least you get to see that.

5807
04:34:08,160 --> 04:34:10,520
At least you get to see...

5808
04:34:12,100 --> 04:34:14,300
Now we're beating Batman today!

5809
04:34:15,660 --> 04:34:16,520
Oh my god.

5810
04:34:16,560 --> 04:34:17,180
I'm in!

5811
04:34:17,460 --> 04:34:18,160
I'm in!

5812
04:34:18,420 --> 04:34:19,540
I'm back in!

5813
04:34:20,320 --> 04:34:21,820
I'm back in, guys!

5814
04:34:22,860 --> 04:34:23,980
Everyth... Oh my god.

5815
04:34:24,040 --> 04:34:25,060
Everything is okay.

5816
04:34:25,060 --> 04:34:25,300
Okay.

5817
04:34:25,860 --> 04:34:27,340
Everything is okay everybody.

5818
04:34:28,180 --> 04:34:29,300
We're back in it.

5819
04:34:30,400 --> 04:34:31,460
Wait, not this one.

5820
04:34:31,800 --> 04:34:33,480
We're back in it guys, look.

5821
04:34:33,940 --> 04:34:35,140
Look, we're back in it.

5822
04:34:35,560 --> 04:34:36,720
Everything is fine.

5823
04:34:37,940 --> 04:34:38,680
Here we go.

5824
04:34:42,600 --> 04:34:44,260
Alright, wait, I forgot to...

5825
04:34:44,260 --> 04:34:46,760
I need to tap back into my chat.

5826
04:34:48,300 --> 04:34:48,740
Okay.

5827
04:34:50,080 --> 04:34:50,520
Nice.

5828
04:34:51,560 --> 04:34:52,940
That's it, thank you for the super chat.

5829
04:34:53,020 --> 04:34:53,720
Thank you, thank you.

5830
04:34:53,720 --> 04:34:55,040
We gotta stop Poison Ivy now.

5831
04:34:55,120 --> 04:34:55,900
How do I get out of here?

5832
04:34:57,000 --> 04:34:58,240
I guess like here?

5833
04:34:59,160 --> 04:34:59,940
That's what I'm saying.

5834
04:35:00,000 --> 04:35:00,980
Okay, anyway, that's what I was saying.

5835
04:35:01,220 --> 04:35:02,360
Who the fuck built this?

5836
04:35:07,240 --> 04:35:07,720
Like...

5837
04:35:08,220 --> 04:35:09,860
Are you guys as confused as me?

5838
04:35:11,220 --> 04:35:11,900
I don't know.

5839
04:35:11,920 --> 04:35:12,720
Who built this?

5840
04:35:17,280 --> 04:35:20,540
Alright, I guess this way.

5841
04:35:23,720 --> 04:35:26,080
There's no way Bruce Wayne did this.

5842
04:35:26,500 --> 04:35:26,980
Like...

5843
04:35:27,000 --> 04:35:28,240
Yeah, he beats up people.

5844
04:35:28,520 --> 04:35:31,180
But like, he does not have the fucking...

5845
04:35:31,700 --> 04:35:35,100
He does not have like the work ethics to build this.

5846
04:35:35,320 --> 04:35:36,240
God damn it.

5847
04:35:38,280 --> 04:35:40,980
There's no way to let Alfred build this.

5848
04:35:41,100 --> 04:35:42,180
He's fucking old.

5849
04:35:45,320 --> 04:35:45,880
Oh.

5850
04:35:47,180 --> 04:35:48,400
Oh, okay, here we go.

5851
04:35:48,500 --> 04:35:50,140
Oh, I can finally do that wall.

5852
04:35:50,300 --> 04:35:50,880
Okay, nice.

5853
04:35:51,040 --> 04:35:51,300
Okay.

5854
04:35:56,280 --> 04:35:58,540
He built multiple by himself?

5855
04:35:59,880 --> 04:36:00,460
Oh, okay.

5856
04:36:00,460 --> 04:36:00,460
Here we go.

5857
04:36:00,460 --> 04:36:00,460
Oh, I can finally do that wall.

5858
04:36:00,460 --> 04:36:00,460
Okay, nice.

5859
04:36:00,460 --> 04:36:00,460
Okay.

5860
04:36:00,460 --> 04:36:02,600
Bro, okay, labrum...

5861
04:36:03,640 --> 04:36:04,640
Nice kick, Batman.

5862
04:36:09,060 --> 04:36:12,540
There's no way he built this by himself.

5863
04:36:16,520 --> 04:36:18,860
Jason Momoa built it and painted it.

5864
04:36:18,960 --> 04:36:20,020
Thank you for the super chat.

5865
04:36:20,140 --> 04:36:20,380
Thank you.

5866
04:36:20,920 --> 04:36:27,930
Oh yeah, Alfred beats super .

5867
04:36:27,930 --> 04:36:28,370
I saw it.

5868
04:36:28,450 --> 04:36:30,350
I've seen that comic before.

5869
04:36:31,050 --> 04:36:32,290
He got like, kryptonite.

5870
04:36:32,350 --> 04:36:33,070
Like, those like...

5871
04:36:33,070 --> 04:36:35,090
You know those mob wrist...

5872
04:36:35,090 --> 04:36:36,490
brace or whatever?

5873
04:36:36,870 --> 04:36:38,090
But then it's like kryptonite.

5874
04:36:42,350 --> 04:36:46,030
Alfred does not have the engineer degree to build a fucking Batcave.

5875
04:36:48,610 --> 04:36:54,590
Like, there's... I refuse to believe that he has the degree to fucking...

5876
04:36:54,590 --> 04:36:58,150
the engineer degree to build a Batcave.

5877
04:37:00,770 --> 04:37:02,770
Where do I go from here?

5878
04:37:05,750 --> 04:37:07,190
Sure he does.

5879
04:37:07,630 --> 04:37:11,050
Guys, I know you're all Alfred fanboys.

5880
04:37:11,430 --> 04:37:14,590
But like, you guys have to think real fast.

5881
04:37:16,990 --> 04:37:19,950
Guys, think for a second, please.

5882
04:37:27,290 --> 04:37:28,850
He can get one.

5883
04:37:28,930 --> 04:37:32,210
Yes, but that doesn't mean he's qualified to fucking build a Batcave.

5884
04:37:33,390 --> 04:37:35,130
Alfred's Mike Kamioshi.

5885
04:37:39,430 --> 04:37:40,130
It's true.

5886
04:37:40,170 --> 04:37:41,130
I just googled it.

5887
04:37:41,210 --> 04:37:44,470
Then that makes me like less trustworthy of the Batcave.

5888
04:37:45,590 --> 04:37:47,810
He doesn't even have a degree for this.

5889
04:37:47,910 --> 04:37:52,810
How can I trust him to build a fucking structure in a cave?

5890
04:37:56,230 --> 04:37:57,090
Alfred's a homie?

5891
04:37:57,130 --> 04:37:57,950
Well, he's fucking dead.

5892
04:37:58,210 --> 04:37:58,650
Like...

5893
04:38:03,510 --> 04:38:05,910
Do you not remember what I established?

5894
04:38:06,210 --> 04:38:07,370
He's not even...

5895
04:38:07,630 --> 04:38:08,970
He's been dead for five years!

5896
04:38:09,970 --> 04:38:10,970
Here I go.

5897
04:38:15,370 --> 04:38:16,990
I'm called for.

5898
04:38:20,780 --> 04:38:21,460
Here?

5899
04:38:24,480 --> 04:38:25,780
I'm just back here.

5900
04:38:29,000 --> 04:38:30,680
Isn't this the original cave?

5901
04:38:31,400 --> 04:38:32,620
No, this is different.

5902
04:38:35,640 --> 04:38:37,000
Too soon!

5903
04:38:38,440 --> 04:38:39,640
But it's different.

5904
04:38:45,690 --> 04:38:47,890
You guys had to know this sooner or later.

5905
04:38:48,170 --> 04:38:50,370
Because I said it during the part one.

5906
04:38:57,780 --> 04:39:00,540
He won't be when they reboot it.

5907
04:39:02,360 --> 04:39:03,620
Okay, that's true.

5908
04:39:03,940 --> 04:39:04,720
That's true.

5909
04:39:05,480 --> 04:39:06,520
You're not wrong.

5910
04:39:06,720 --> 04:39:07,780
You're not wrong, guys.

5911
04:39:08,040 --> 04:39:08,800
Don't worry.

5912
04:39:08,960 --> 04:39:10,060
When they reboot it.

5913
04:39:14,610 --> 04:39:18,130
That man literally chose to build a getaway home under asylum.

5914
04:39:19,050 --> 04:39:19,890
Yes, but who?

5915
04:39:20,010 --> 04:39:20,890
There's no way.

5916
04:39:21,030 --> 04:39:21,550
I'm not sure.

5917
04:39:21,550 --> 04:39:23,050
Bruce Wayne built this by himself.

5918
04:39:23,230 --> 04:39:26,590
I refuse to believe Bruce Wayne built this by himself.

5919
04:39:26,730 --> 04:39:28,830
He didn't even finish school!

5920
04:39:30,030 --> 04:39:32,190
He went and learned martial arts.

5921
04:39:35,170 --> 04:39:36,690
Lucius Fox is underrated.

5922
04:39:36,810 --> 04:39:38,350
He helped with the gadgets and stuff.

5923
04:39:38,550 --> 04:39:41,370
Yeah, they really get one guy to build the fucking...

5924
04:39:41,370 --> 04:39:42,770
Oh my god, it's time to fist this plant.

5925
04:39:44,110 --> 04:39:46,050
He borrowed some tools.

5926
04:39:47,250 --> 04:39:47,770
Like...

5927
04:39:47,770 --> 04:39:49,410
Now I'm scared!

5928
04:39:49,690 --> 04:39:52,410
Because he's more likely to build a fucking sinkhole.

5929
04:39:53,290 --> 04:39:54,810
Because he's more likely to build a fucking sinkhole.

5930
04:39:54,810 --> 04:39:55,730
They won't get that far.

5931
04:39:56,150 --> 04:39:57,990
My antidote will stop them.

5932
04:40:04,420 --> 04:40:04,980
Alright.

5933
04:40:05,980 --> 04:40:06,940
Poki, please.

5934
04:40:08,100 --> 04:40:09,400
He's a billionaire.

5935
04:40:16,800 --> 04:40:18,320
Even the Batcave?

5936
04:40:18,460 --> 04:40:18,740
Even the Batcave?

5937
04:40:18,740 --> 04:40:20,160
That's fucked up.

5938
04:40:20,380 --> 04:40:20,840
Okay.

5939
04:40:21,100 --> 04:40:25,220
That's fucked up that he got two elderly people to build his fucking home.

5940
04:40:25,880 --> 04:40:26,040
Hahaha!

5941
04:40:35,740 --> 04:40:37,320
I feel like that's even worse.

5942
04:40:40,880 --> 04:40:41,500
Oh shit.

5943
04:40:41,580 --> 04:40:41,900
Fist.

5944
04:40:45,240 --> 04:40:45,640
Alright.

5945
04:40:45,760 --> 04:40:45,980
Ow!

5946
04:40:52,260 --> 04:40:53,080
Where did I go?

5947
04:40:54,000 --> 04:40:54,640
Where am I?

5948
04:40:55,680 --> 04:40:57,200
Okay, I need to figure out how to get up there.

5949
04:40:58,380 --> 04:40:59,340
Where are the plants?

5950
04:41:01,680 --> 04:41:02,440
Where are the plants?

5951
04:41:02,440 --> 04:41:05,600
He made kids build his fucking Batcave?

5952
04:41:05,920 --> 04:41:06,640
Hahaha!

5953
04:41:07,580 --> 04:41:08,340
Hahaha!

5954
04:41:11,730 --> 04:41:15,990
I was gonna say Robins helped with building...

5955
04:41:15,990 --> 04:41:16,510
Bro!

5956
04:41:16,690 --> 04:41:18,610
The elderly and the kids?

5957
04:41:18,950 --> 04:41:20,150
We need to stop him.

5958
04:41:21,810 --> 04:41:24,070
Somebody stop Batman.

5959
04:41:24,070 --> 04:41:24,310
Bad.

5960
04:41:37,200 --> 04:41:37,680
Alright.

5961
04:41:37,940 --> 04:41:39,360
I think it's like...

5962
04:41:39,960 --> 04:41:42,400
Am I close to the fucking area yet?

5963
04:41:43,880 --> 04:41:45,440
No, I have to get head up.

5964
04:41:46,300 --> 04:41:46,780
No.

5965
04:41:48,320 --> 04:41:50,480
Who's gonna stop him, Joker?

5966
04:41:52,620 --> 04:41:54,200
No one can stop him.

5967
04:41:55,300 --> 04:41:56,680
Game.net, thank you for the super chat.

5968
04:41:56,780 --> 04:41:57,600
Thank you, thank you!

5969
04:41:57,600 --> 04:41:58,660
Thank you, Batman Facts.

5970
04:41:58,720 --> 04:42:02,120
Batman builds a Batman with the help of Alfred, Robin and Harold.

5971
04:42:02,720 --> 04:42:03,600
Batman's tech guide.

5972
04:42:03,700 --> 04:42:09,360
Wayne tells a construction crew he's building a scenic cave and then they haul it out and assemble the mechanical bits.

5973
04:42:25,090 --> 04:42:29,430
Oh my god, he's gonna poison the water supply again!

5974
04:42:30,290 --> 04:42:31,490
Also, thank you for the super chat.

5975
04:42:31,530 --> 04:42:32,950
Thank you, thank you.

5976
04:42:33,010 --> 04:42:34,190
I can't believe it!

5977
04:42:34,550 --> 04:42:35,530
He got kids!

5978
04:42:35,830 --> 04:42:36,970
And the other league!

5979
04:42:38,370 --> 04:42:40,510
Who's gonna stop him?!

5980
04:42:44,110 --> 04:42:44,990
Alright, fist.

5981
04:42:49,570 --> 04:42:53,110
Why does this look like a... Why is this cave shaped like a bat?

5982
04:43:00,870 --> 04:43:01,610
That's weird.

5983
04:43:06,870 --> 04:43:07,390
Ow.

5984
04:43:09,830 --> 04:43:10,770
Where did I go?

5985
04:43:11,530 --> 04:43:12,150
This way?

5986
04:43:14,130 --> 04:43:15,450
Where the fuck is the...

5987
04:43:16,730 --> 04:43:18,130
God, there's so many areas.

5988
04:43:19,310 --> 04:43:20,530
Did I go the wrong way?

5989
04:43:23,410 --> 04:43:24,110
This way?

5990
04:43:26,310 --> 04:43:28,370
Bro, where the fuck is the exit?

5991
04:43:32,020 --> 04:43:33,340
Okay, it's like here.

5992
04:43:35,240 --> 04:43:36,600
It's below me, I think.

5993
04:43:39,000 --> 04:43:39,940
Yeah, it's right here.

5994
04:43:40,020 --> 04:43:40,640
Okay, thank god.

5995
04:43:45,070 --> 04:43:46,950
I... this was where I came from.

5996
04:43:49,350 --> 04:43:51,470
This is...

5997
04:43:51,620 --> 04:43:54,410
Thank god, fucking...

5998
04:43:54,410 --> 04:43:55,770
Alright, let's do this again.

5999
04:43:56,310 --> 04:43:57,290
I...

6000
04:43:58,070 --> 04:43:58,690
No...

6001
04:43:58,690 --> 04:43:59,250
Nooo!

6002
04:44:02,750 --> 04:44:04,690
I went down!

6003
04:44:05,940 --> 04:44:07,910
I went down.

6004
04:44:07,910 --> 04:44:09,510
I went down.

6005
04:44:11,130 --> 04:44:13,230
Oh my god.

6006
04:44:13,930 --> 04:44:14,450
Oh my god.

6007
04:44:14,450 --> 04:44:15,950
I can't believe I went down.

6008
04:44:16,170 --> 04:44:17,730
This is because I'm on wifi.

6009
04:44:19,110 --> 04:44:22,470
Even my fucking brain cells have gone down with the wifi.

6010
04:44:25,050 --> 04:44:27,070
Gamers don't look up cars.

6011
04:44:27,290 --> 04:44:27,630
No!

6012
04:44:28,090 --> 04:44:30,170
Thank you for the super chat.

6013
04:44:30,290 --> 04:44:30,650
Thank you.

6014
04:44:39,340 --> 04:44:42,380
Oh my god, I'm back in the beginning?

6015
04:44:42,640 --> 04:44:43,560
Okay, I can fast travel.

6016
04:44:43,720 --> 04:44:44,780
I can speedrun this.

6017
04:44:46,480 --> 04:44:47,700
I blame the wifi.

6018
04:44:48,840 --> 04:44:51,360
If I wasn't on wifi, things would be easier.

6019
04:44:54,500 --> 04:44:55,920
It's never my fault.

6020
04:44:55,980 --> 04:44:57,080
It's the wifi's fault.

6021
04:45:00,950 --> 04:45:02,090
Alright, here we go.

6022
04:45:06,010 --> 04:45:07,130
This way.

6023
04:45:07,890 --> 04:45:09,130
Then we go up.

6024
04:45:09,630 --> 04:45:11,930
Just don't fall, please Batman.

6025
04:45:12,290 --> 04:45:13,450
Do not fall!

6026
04:45:14,330 --> 04:45:15,550
Up I go!

6027
04:45:16,670 --> 04:45:17,250
Okay.

6028
04:45:17,950 --> 04:45:19,110
Oh my god!

6029
04:45:19,490 --> 04:45:20,890
That's where the up was.

6030
04:45:21,130 --> 04:45:22,810
I noticed the up now.

6031
04:45:23,510 --> 04:45:24,850
I noticed it.

6032
04:45:25,550 --> 04:45:26,550
It's up here.

6033
04:45:28,510 --> 04:45:29,930
It's up here guys.

6034
04:45:30,050 --> 04:45:31,370
I figured it out.

6035
04:45:38,310 --> 04:45:39,830
I'm so sad.

6036
04:45:44,750 --> 04:45:46,050
I'm so sad.

6037
04:45:49,450 --> 04:45:50,830
Thank you for the super chat.

6038
04:45:50,950 --> 04:45:51,210
Thank you.

6039
04:45:51,230 --> 04:45:51,790
Thank you.

6040
04:45:51,910 --> 04:45:55,190
On this episode, Doki gets lost again.

6041
04:45:56,830 --> 04:45:57,450
Okay.

6042
04:45:58,790 --> 04:45:59,410
Where?

6043
04:46:04,380 --> 04:46:05,000
Where?

6044
04:46:05,700 --> 04:46:06,320
Here.

6045
04:46:06,840 --> 04:46:07,460
Alright.

6046
04:46:09,760 --> 04:46:10,380
Boop.

6047
04:46:10,960 --> 04:46:17,080
Oh thank god there's a Riller trophy to tell me where.

6048
04:46:21,630 --> 04:46:22,170
Joker?

6049
04:46:22,170 --> 04:46:25,390
Is that Joker?

6050
04:46:26,070 --> 04:46:27,090
Joker, please!

6051
04:46:27,530 --> 04:46:30,050
Let me listen to your voice so I don't get lost!

6052
04:46:33,490 --> 04:46:35,010
How the fuck do I get up there?

6053
04:46:38,650 --> 04:46:39,190
Huh?

6054
04:46:44,490 --> 04:46:48,350
Can I... Can I do it from... from the claw?

6055
04:46:49,630 --> 04:46:50,130
Wait.

6056
04:46:50,390 --> 04:46:50,890
Oh!

6057
04:46:51,690 --> 04:46:52,190
Boop!

6058
04:46:53,230 --> 04:46:53,730
Nice.

6059
04:46:55,910 --> 04:46:56,910
Bat claw time.

6060
04:46:58,130 --> 04:46:58,630
Yay!

6061
04:46:59,230 --> 04:47:00,150
Come over here!

6062
04:47:00,350 --> 04:47:01,530
Make a... make a bridge!

6063
04:47:02,670 --> 04:47:03,830
I mean I could do this.

6064
04:47:05,270 --> 04:47:06,550
Make a bridge for me!

6065
04:47:11,250 --> 04:47:12,450
God damn it.

6066
04:47:12,490 --> 04:47:13,630
I wanted to make a bridge.

6067
04:47:13,890 --> 04:47:16,450
Wait how the... how the fuck do I get over there still?

6068
04:47:17,830 --> 04:47:18,330
Instructions?

6069
04:47:18,330 --> 04:47:18,810
Instructions unclear.

6070
04:47:24,190 --> 04:47:24,790
Alright.

6071
04:47:26,490 --> 04:47:27,770
Obviously not this.

6072
04:47:30,550 --> 04:47:33,530
Grapple and... Can I grapple up now?

6073
04:47:33,850 --> 04:47:34,730
Oh now I can!

6074
04:47:34,890 --> 04:47:35,110
Okay.

6075
04:47:35,230 --> 04:47:36,990
I didn't realize I could grapple now.

6076
04:47:38,270 --> 04:47:38,870
Yes!

6077
04:47:39,850 --> 04:47:40,450
Yay!

6078
04:47:42,350 --> 04:47:43,530
What the fuck?

6079
04:47:43,550 --> 04:47:44,550
Where did you come from?

6080
04:47:45,790 --> 04:47:46,810
Holy shit!

6081
04:47:46,810 --> 04:47:48,170
I'm so blind.

6082
04:47:48,630 --> 04:47:49,110
Alright!

6083
04:47:49,250 --> 04:47:50,090
Thank you for the five!

6084
04:47:50,150 --> 04:47:50,630
Give the ship!

6085
04:47:50,750 --> 04:47:50,970
Thank you!

6086
04:47:51,130 --> 04:47:51,450
Thank you!

6087
04:47:51,850 --> 04:47:56,370
Oh for the love of... I suppose that's you in there, Bat.

6088
04:47:58,390 --> 04:47:59,990
Well enjoy it while you can!

6089
04:48:00,290 --> 04:48:02,550
These caves will be your tomb.

6090
04:48:05,310 --> 04:48:08,770
Wait he stopped moving just like me when I was on the Wi-Fi.

6091
04:48:10,850 --> 04:48:12,150
Alright up we go.

6092
04:48:13,610 --> 04:48:14,630
Open the door.

6093
04:48:16,810 --> 04:48:18,090
Don't worry.

6094
04:48:18,550 --> 04:48:20,250
I have this.

6095
04:48:20,730 --> 04:48:21,330
Whoop whoop!

6096
04:48:22,490 --> 04:48:23,570
Yay!

6097
04:48:26,170 --> 04:48:27,250
Concussion!

6098
04:48:30,980 --> 04:48:31,520
Nice.

6099
04:48:33,380 --> 04:48:34,960
I'm happy now.

6100
04:48:37,500 --> 04:48:38,580
Endercon?

6101
04:48:43,040 --> 04:48:43,580
Teef!

6102
04:48:45,760 --> 04:48:46,840
Alright.

6103
04:48:48,660 --> 04:48:50,340
Oh fuck that's a lot of things.

6104
04:48:50,540 --> 04:48:50,740
Okay.

6105
04:48:52,380 --> 04:48:52,780
Baska!

6106
04:48:52,860 --> 04:48:53,600
Thank you for the super chat!

6107
04:48:53,700 --> 04:48:53,920
Thank you!

6108
04:48:53,960 --> 04:48:54,460
Thank you!

6109
04:48:54,600 --> 04:48:55,000
Joki!

6110
04:48:55,100 --> 04:48:56,260
What CP model do you use?

6111
04:48:56,360 --> 04:49:00,860
I know I have stability issues due to unoptimized bias setting.

6112
04:49:00,960 --> 04:49:02,260
Maybe a mem test as well?

6113
04:49:02,360 --> 04:49:03,720
You may want to get your settings checked.

6114
04:49:03,820 --> 04:49:04,640
Great stream by the way.

6115
04:49:05,560 --> 04:49:06,360
Good question!

6116
04:49:07,460 --> 04:49:07,860
Teef!

6117
04:49:11,100 --> 04:49:11,580
Wait!

6118
04:49:19,360 --> 04:49:20,480
Alright let's see.

6119
04:49:20,520 --> 04:49:21,280
Where do I go?

6120
04:49:24,340 --> 04:49:25,320
Do they see me?

6121
04:49:28,040 --> 04:49:28,520
Wait!

6122
04:49:30,140 --> 04:49:31,140
It's not my crutch!

6123
04:49:31,240 --> 04:49:32,200
But there's a gargoyle!

6124
04:49:34,300 --> 04:49:35,620
It's not my crutch I swear!

6125
04:49:36,360 --> 04:49:38,860
But now I got the gargoyle!

6126
04:49:42,180 --> 04:49:42,760
Gargoyle!

6127
04:49:47,000 --> 04:49:47,580
Gargoyle!

6128
04:49:51,480 --> 04:49:53,100
I don't think he saw me.

6129
04:49:56,780 --> 04:49:57,360
Goodbye!

6130
04:49:59,960 --> 04:50:00,540
Nice.

6131
04:50:02,280 --> 04:50:02,860
Gargoyle!

6132
04:50:04,880 --> 04:50:05,460
Yay!

6133
04:50:10,420 --> 04:50:11,800
Okay wait I can do this again.

6134
04:50:12,420 --> 04:50:13,780
I can do this again.

6135
04:50:15,280 --> 04:50:16,420
Here I go again.

6136
04:50:20,340 --> 04:50:20,980
Gargoyle!

6137
04:50:24,140 --> 04:50:27,280
How many gargoyles can I get away with?

6138
04:50:35,140 --> 04:50:37,140
Let me make my pile!

6139
04:50:39,430 --> 04:50:39,690
Pile.

6140
04:50:43,510 --> 04:50:44,150
This...

6141
04:50:44,150 --> 04:50:45,910
My gargoyle pile!

6142
04:50:49,430 --> 04:50:50,810
Okay I'll put it here.

6143
04:50:52,870 --> 04:50:53,250
No!

6144
04:50:56,210 --> 04:50:58,110
My gargoyle pile!

6145
04:51:01,810 --> 04:51:02,650
Go over there!

6146
04:51:05,770 --> 04:51:06,850
Yes right here!

6147
04:51:07,350 --> 04:51:08,410
Right here!

6148
04:51:08,830 --> 04:51:09,490
Yes!

6149
04:51:10,210 --> 04:51:11,630
Go to the pile!

6150
04:51:12,890 --> 04:51:14,110
Where are you?

6151
04:51:14,990 --> 04:51:15,370
Goodbye!

6152
04:51:18,170 --> 04:51:19,010
Don't look up.

6153
04:51:19,010 --> 04:51:19,890
Don't look up though.

6154
04:51:20,350 --> 04:51:21,550
Just head to the pile!

6155
04:51:21,790 --> 04:51:24,190
Just head to the pile!

6156
04:51:24,410 --> 04:51:25,350
You know you want to!

6157
04:51:26,130 --> 04:51:26,710
Come on!

6158
04:51:29,430 --> 04:51:30,310
Oh whoops!

6159
04:51:31,710 --> 04:51:32,750
Get to the pile!

6160
04:51:34,110 --> 04:51:35,370
I'm sure it came from over there!

6161
04:51:36,010 --> 04:51:36,970
Yes it did!

6162
04:51:37,090 --> 04:51:37,330
No!

6163
04:51:37,330 --> 04:51:37,910
Not there!

6164
04:51:38,450 --> 04:51:38,890
Fucking...

6165
04:51:38,890 --> 04:51:39,790
I'm fucking gonna kill him.

6166
04:51:39,910 --> 04:51:40,610
Dude fuck this.

6167
04:51:43,730 --> 04:51:45,090
My beautiful pile.

6168
04:51:45,770 --> 04:51:47,070
Maybe there's still one more.

6169
04:51:47,210 --> 04:51:47,630
Let's go!

6170
04:51:47,650 --> 04:51:49,030
There's still one more.

6171
04:51:49,150 --> 04:51:50,890
He'll eventually come over here, right?

6172
04:51:51,110 --> 04:51:52,990
Come to the pile!

6173
04:51:54,830 --> 04:51:55,350
Please!

6174
04:51:56,070 --> 04:51:57,410
Report to the pile!

6175
04:51:58,830 --> 04:52:00,010
It's so cool!

6176
04:52:00,350 --> 04:52:01,290
You know, I'll make this pile.

6177
04:52:01,470 --> 04:52:02,550
This is my new pile.

6178
04:52:03,830 --> 04:52:04,830
My new pile.

6179
04:52:05,070 --> 04:52:05,770
Oh shit!

6180
04:52:05,910 --> 04:52:06,810
Oh shit!

6181
04:52:06,890 --> 04:52:07,690
There's one more?

6182
04:52:08,870 --> 04:52:10,010
We have... Whoa!

6183
04:52:11,710 --> 04:52:14,190
Guys, there was a lot of people still alive.

6184
04:52:20,230 --> 04:52:21,610
If it works, it works!

6185
04:52:22,030 --> 04:52:23,450
There's a lot... That's okay!

6186
04:52:23,710 --> 04:52:25,370
One HP in the dream again!

6187
04:52:25,850 --> 04:52:29,150
I made a new pile.

6188
04:52:30,190 --> 04:52:32,090
Did you guys like my new pile?

6189
04:52:35,330 --> 04:52:36,650
Pile number two.

6190
04:52:40,390 --> 04:52:41,370
My pile.

6191
04:52:41,890 --> 04:52:43,850
Alright, what was the riddle for this?

6192
04:52:43,910 --> 04:52:44,530
Riddle me this.

6193
04:52:45,090 --> 04:52:46,550
Oh hey, there's a thing here.

6194
04:52:47,390 --> 04:52:47,910
Nice.

6195
04:52:49,570 --> 04:52:50,770
Seriously, thank you for the super chat.

6196
04:52:50,870 --> 04:52:51,410
Thank you, thank you.

6197
04:52:51,410 --> 04:52:53,990
The concussion won't kill him, but the medical... That's what I'm saying!

6198
04:52:54,530 --> 04:52:57,470
Like, this is much worse than like not killing.

6199
04:52:57,790 --> 04:53:00,030
Because now you're giving him like medical debt.

6200
04:53:00,430 --> 04:53:01,230
In America.

6201
04:53:02,530 --> 04:53:04,930
And I'm pretty sure like... Because like...

6202
04:53:04,930 --> 04:53:07,310
It's a superhero area too.

6203
04:53:08,730 --> 04:53:11,530
So like... Like the insurance is like...

6204
04:53:11,530 --> 04:53:13,350
Even worse than normal insurance.

6205
04:53:13,950 --> 04:53:15,730
And I feel like the medic... Oh my gosh.

6206
04:53:15,790 --> 04:53:15,970
Stop.

6207
04:53:16,550 --> 04:53:18,030
The doctor must be so fucking nice.

6208
04:53:18,370 --> 04:53:21,210
Because all the people that are like need doctors.

6209
04:53:25,020 --> 04:53:25,980
Riddle me this.

6210
04:53:27,440 --> 04:53:30,040
Wait, that's why Batman owns like a pharmacy.

6211
04:53:31,480 --> 04:53:33,860
Did you guys know Batman also owns a pharmacy?

6212
04:53:34,580 --> 04:53:35,780
Oh my god!

6213
04:53:36,380 --> 04:53:37,980
That's so fucked up, Batman.

6214
04:53:43,240 --> 04:53:45,660
Batman, that's pretty fucked up.

6215
04:53:45,680 --> 04:53:47,060
He is part of the problem.

6216
04:53:48,740 --> 04:53:51,060
He is actually part of the problem.

6217
04:53:51,280 --> 04:53:52,000
Holy shit.

6218
04:53:53,080 --> 04:53:54,920
I never realized that.

6219
04:53:58,250 --> 04:53:59,550
Anything to scan here?

6220
04:54:00,450 --> 04:54:01,770
It all adds up.

6221
04:54:01,810 --> 04:54:02,090
Oh yeah.

6222
04:54:03,590 --> 04:54:04,230
Okay.

6223
04:54:06,830 --> 04:54:08,630
It's time for hacking time.

6224
04:54:13,000 --> 04:54:14,640
Okay, where's the other one?

6225
04:54:17,220 --> 04:54:17,860
Nice.

6226
04:54:17,860 --> 04:54:18,280
Two.

6227
04:54:18,340 --> 04:54:19,280
Last one.

6228
04:54:23,940 --> 04:54:24,060
Oh no.

6229
04:54:24,180 --> 04:54:25,720
Why is the last one always the hardest?

6230
04:54:25,820 --> 04:54:26,400
Where is it?

6231
04:54:27,900 --> 04:54:28,680
Oh, here it is.

6232
04:54:29,460 --> 04:54:29,900
Nice.

6233
04:54:32,300 --> 04:54:34,580
The Batman infinite money glitch.

6234
04:54:35,160 --> 04:54:38,000
It's like the infinite chocolate glitch but for money.

6235
04:54:40,160 --> 04:54:40,600
Nice.

6236
04:54:40,640 --> 04:54:41,580
How do I solve this riddle?

6237
04:54:41,640 --> 04:54:42,500
What was this riddle again?

6238
04:54:46,220 --> 04:54:47,560
What was this one's riddle?

6239
04:54:55,320 --> 04:54:56,320
Blow up the floor?

6240
04:54:56,600 --> 04:54:57,700
No, there's nothing there.

6241
04:54:58,860 --> 04:54:59,520
No, no.

6242
04:54:59,600 --> 04:55:00,580
Batman doesn't own everything.

6243
04:55:00,580 --> 04:55:04,820
Because for some fucking reason, Gotham has like 200 fucking billionaires that live here.

6244
04:55:05,040 --> 04:55:15,440
Like every villain or hero here is either a billionaire villain or a billionaire hero.

6245
04:55:17,640 --> 04:55:18,200
What?

6246
04:55:19,900 --> 04:55:20,920
I hear people.

6247
04:55:21,140 --> 04:55:21,740
Oh, there they are.

6248
04:55:22,860 --> 04:55:25,160
It's the new Silicon Valley.

6249
04:55:27,580 --> 04:55:28,140
Alright.

6250
04:55:28,460 --> 04:55:29,020
Boop.

6251
04:55:29,040 --> 04:55:29,560
Boop.

6252
04:55:29,560 --> 04:55:30,040
Oh, wait.

6253
04:55:30,100 --> 04:55:30,800
That's not what I wanted.

6254
04:55:31,200 --> 04:55:31,560
Boop.

6255
04:55:32,940 --> 04:55:33,600
There you go.

6256
04:55:34,160 --> 04:55:35,020
Get down over here.

6257
04:55:35,380 --> 04:55:35,740
Boop.

6258
04:55:36,200 --> 04:55:36,560
Nice.

6259
04:55:42,900 --> 04:55:43,580
There's a vent?

6260
04:55:43,680 --> 04:55:44,380
It's in the vent?

6261
04:55:44,540 --> 04:55:44,860
The riddle?

6262
04:55:46,520 --> 04:55:46,880
Okay.

6263
04:55:46,920 --> 04:55:47,720
Is it in this vent?

6264
04:55:48,980 --> 04:55:49,340
Ow.

6265
04:55:49,460 --> 04:55:49,680
Sorry.

6266
04:55:53,220 --> 04:55:54,460
Where's the riddle?

6267
04:56:04,400 --> 04:56:04,920
What's this?

6268
04:56:05,240 --> 04:56:05,920
Where am I?

6269
04:56:09,450 --> 04:56:10,570
I don't know where I am.

6270
04:56:11,650 --> 04:56:12,570
Where's this place?

6271
04:56:13,450 --> 04:56:14,890
Where the fuck am I?

6272
04:56:15,390 --> 04:56:18,230
Oh, I'm in this other event area.

6273
04:56:22,900 --> 04:56:27,300
Gotham City is either where all the rich people live or where all the poor people live.

6274
04:56:27,300 --> 04:56:29,020
There's no middle class in Gotham City.

6275
04:56:29,680 --> 04:56:31,660
If you think about it.

6276
04:56:38,910 --> 04:56:39,430
Alright.

6277
04:56:39,530 --> 04:56:41,750
I don't know where the riddle is for this one.

6278
04:56:41,870 --> 04:56:42,330
Oh, well.

6279
04:56:44,490 --> 04:56:47,210
I think we have to go back this way.

6280
04:56:50,350 --> 04:56:51,450
Alex, thank you for the super chat.

6281
04:56:51,510 --> 04:56:51,770
Thank you.

6282
04:56:51,810 --> 04:56:52,350
Thank you.

6283
04:56:52,530 --> 04:56:53,510
I swear to God.

6284
04:56:53,590 --> 04:56:54,770
I swear to fucking God.

6285
04:56:54,810 --> 04:56:55,450
My Wi-Fi.

6286
04:57:05,050 --> 04:57:05,850
Wi-Fi.

6287
04:57:05,870 --> 04:57:07,910
Why you must do this to me, Wi-Fi?

6288
04:57:10,350 --> 04:57:10,750
Oh,

6289
04:57:14,390 --> 04:57:14,990
you fuck.

6290
04:57:15,350 --> 04:57:15,750
Please!

6291
04:57:15,750 --> 04:57:17,590
Let me beat Batman!

6292
04:57:17,930 --> 04:57:18,870
That's all I want!

6293
04:57:19,290 --> 04:57:20,570
That's all I want!

6294
04:57:20,970 --> 04:57:23,950
I'm so close to beating Batman!

6295
04:57:24,790 --> 04:57:26,570
Oh my God!

6296
04:57:26,690 --> 04:57:28,650
I'm so fucking close!

6297
04:57:34,870 --> 04:57:36,590
No, it's just...

6298
04:57:36,590 --> 04:57:37,370
Okay, I'm back.

6299
04:57:37,490 --> 04:57:38,230
Okay, I'm back.

6300
04:57:38,410 --> 04:57:39,630
I'm fucking back.

6301
04:57:40,590 --> 04:57:42,710
I swear to fucking God.

6302
04:57:42,750 --> 04:57:43,910
Wi-Fi, please.

6303
04:57:47,010 --> 04:57:48,530
Please, Wi-Fi!

6304
04:57:50,710 --> 04:57:51,370
Here we go.

6305
04:57:52,050 --> 04:57:53,070
That should be it.

6306
04:57:53,250 --> 04:57:53,750
Is it this?

6307
04:57:53,890 --> 04:57:54,090
No.

6308
04:57:56,070 --> 04:57:56,910
Here we go.

6309
04:57:57,570 --> 04:57:58,530
Oh my God.

6310
04:57:58,630 --> 04:57:59,190
Wi-Fi!

6311
04:58:02,610 --> 04:58:04,630
So Batman, I have time to beat up.

6312
04:58:04,830 --> 04:58:05,670
I crashed.

6313
04:58:11,760 --> 04:58:13,240
I will beat you!

6314
04:58:13,640 --> 04:58:15,420
I will beat you, Batman!

6315
04:58:17,380 --> 04:58:20,560
I will beat you so I never have to deal with this again!

6316
04:58:21,420 --> 04:58:22,220
Oh my God!

6317
04:58:22,300 --> 04:58:24,740
Get down, you Jason Momoa!

6318
04:58:25,720 --> 04:58:26,960
Thank you for the super chat.

6319
04:58:27,040 --> 04:58:27,700
Thank you, thank you.

6320
04:58:27,720 --> 04:58:28,140
Are you sure?

6321
04:58:28,680 --> 04:58:29,980
Thank you for the super chat.

6322
04:58:30,300 --> 04:58:32,160
Alan, thank you for the super chat.

6323
04:58:32,220 --> 04:58:32,960
Thank you, thank you.

6324
04:58:32,960 --> 04:58:34,260
Sounds like Mexico.

6325
04:58:35,820 --> 04:58:36,840
All right, here we go.

6326
04:58:39,220 --> 04:58:39,640
No!

6327
04:58:39,640 --> 04:58:41,540
We will beat Batman!

6328
04:58:42,160 --> 04:58:43,420
That's what I'm talking about.

6329
04:58:43,680 --> 04:58:44,240
Part four!

6330
04:58:44,240 --> 04:58:47,420
And deal with this another day.

6331
04:58:49,840 --> 04:58:50,560
Here we go.

6332
04:58:51,040 --> 04:58:51,840
This is it.

6333
04:58:53,220 --> 04:58:53,920
Where am I?

6334
04:58:55,560 --> 04:58:57,080
I swear... Okay, thank God.

6335
04:58:57,540 --> 04:58:58,980
Oh, thank fucking God.

6336
04:58:59,020 --> 04:59:01,720
I was going to say, I swear to God, if I have to do that one area again.

6337
04:59:02,120 --> 04:59:02,560
Okay.

6338
04:59:03,560 --> 04:59:04,920
Thank you for the super chat.

6339
04:59:05,020 --> 04:59:05,280
Thank you.

6340
04:59:06,420 --> 04:59:08,600
Tomato PC upgrade fun.

6341
04:59:09,040 --> 04:59:11,340
You do not listen to me!

6342
04:59:21,780 --> 04:59:24,360
Okay, it's either getting hurt by Batman or getting hurt...

6343
04:59:24,360 --> 04:59:26,620
I feel like I would get hurt by Joker rather than...

6344
04:59:26,620 --> 04:59:28,880
No, get hurt by Batman rather than Joker.

6345
04:59:29,120 --> 04:59:32,120
But Joker would actually make it slow and painful.

6346
04:59:34,600 --> 04:59:35,100
Tee!

6347
04:59:35,380 --> 04:59:35,880
Tee!

6348
04:59:38,640 --> 04:59:40,860
The year is 2055.

6349
04:59:41,440 --> 04:59:44,540
Doki is finally at the final 10% of Batman.

6350
04:59:44,780 --> 04:59:46,320
Will this be the year?

6351
04:59:47,600 --> 04:59:49,380
Dad, thank you for the super chat.

6352
04:59:49,440 --> 04:59:50,160
Thank you, thank you.

6353
04:59:50,380 --> 04:59:53,600
He held him upside down and beat the crap out of him.

6354
04:59:53,600 --> 04:59:55,000
I mean, I just need to get this guy.

6355
04:59:57,640 --> 05:00:00,460
No, I need you to get the guy with the gun!

6356
05:00:06,450 --> 05:00:07,290
The gun!

6357
05:00:07,950 --> 05:00:09,370
Oh my God!

6358
05:00:10,670 --> 05:00:12,010
I'll just kill him.

6359
05:00:18,570 --> 05:00:19,710
It's the gun!

6360
05:00:20,110 --> 05:00:21,430
The gun guy!

6361
05:00:24,030 --> 05:00:24,430
Ow.

6362
05:00:25,050 --> 05:00:25,770
Okay, it's fine.

6363
05:00:25,830 --> 05:00:26,330
I got the gun.

6364
05:00:28,990 --> 05:00:29,570
It's okay.

6365
05:00:29,670 --> 05:00:30,350
We got the gun.

6366
05:00:31,090 --> 05:00:32,490
We got the gun, guys.

6367
05:00:33,550 --> 05:00:34,170
That's okay.

6368
05:00:37,790 --> 05:00:38,190
Okay.

6369
05:00:38,710 --> 05:00:39,270
We're good.

6370
05:00:41,670 --> 05:00:42,290
We're okay.

6371
05:00:42,390 --> 05:00:42,850
We're okay.

6372
05:00:43,630 --> 05:00:44,310
We're okay.

6373
05:00:45,950 --> 05:00:46,890
Everything is fine.

6374
05:00:49,570 --> 05:00:51,110
Panda, welcome to the tomato farm!

6375
05:00:51,170 --> 05:00:51,770
Welcome, welcome!

6376
05:00:51,770 --> 05:00:52,910
Jesus Christ!

6377
05:00:53,430 --> 05:00:54,090
Get away!

6378
05:00:55,530 --> 05:00:56,010
No,

6379
05:00:59,680 --> 05:01:00,120
no, no, no, no!

6380
05:01:00,160 --> 05:01:00,400
Okay.

6381
05:01:00,540 --> 05:01:01,600
Got it counted correctly.

6382
05:01:04,920 --> 05:01:05,400
Nice.

6383
05:01:05,420 --> 05:01:05,700
All right.

6384
05:01:05,760 --> 05:01:06,220
Get him out.

6385
05:01:07,100 --> 05:01:07,580
No.

6386
05:01:07,580 --> 05:01:09,720
What are you... What?!

6387
05:01:10,300 --> 05:01:11,400
I counted it!

6388
05:01:11,460 --> 05:01:12,020
I swear.

6389
05:01:12,280 --> 05:01:13,080
I swear.

6390
05:01:13,300 --> 05:01:14,820
I know I got shanked.

6391
05:01:14,940 --> 05:01:16,960
I got fucking shanked.

6392
05:01:17,480 --> 05:01:19,380
I can't believe it.

6393
05:01:19,940 --> 05:01:22,260
I can't believe I got shanked.

6394
05:01:22,260 --> 05:01:22,460
Okay.

6395
05:01:22,520 --> 05:01:23,560
I'll use the rumor control.

6396
05:01:24,520 --> 05:01:25,480
You know what?

6397
05:01:25,540 --> 05:01:26,480
No, I have an idea.

6398
05:01:29,180 --> 05:01:29,880
There we go.

6399
05:01:32,880 --> 05:01:33,980
That's fucking right.

6400
05:01:34,200 --> 05:01:35,380
What are you gonna do now?

6401
05:01:36,040 --> 05:01:36,480
Nothing!

6402
05:01:38,700 --> 05:01:39,520
That's right.

6403
05:01:41,500 --> 05:01:42,440
You can't do it.

6404
05:01:42,620 --> 05:01:42,820
Woo!

6405
05:01:43,080 --> 05:01:43,320
Yeah!

6406
05:01:43,360 --> 05:01:44,500
I forgot he had... Sorry.

6407
05:01:44,580 --> 05:01:45,480
I forgot he had a gun.

6408
05:01:47,020 --> 05:01:48,900
I forgot he had a gun, guys.

6409
05:01:49,440 --> 05:01:50,440
There's no way.

6410
05:01:50,540 --> 05:01:53,420
I think I can... I think I can kill them with a bat.

6411
05:01:53,440 --> 05:01:53,540
I don't know.

6412
05:01:58,080 --> 05:02:00,720
I think I can kill them with a batarang.

6413
05:02:02,640 --> 05:02:03,180
Woop.

6414
05:02:05,740 --> 05:02:06,580
There we go.

6415
05:02:06,680 --> 05:02:10,440
I think I can kill them with a batarang.

6416
05:02:12,060 --> 05:02:13,900
No, they're all very alive.

6417
05:02:14,280 --> 05:02:17,400
They're all... They're all very alive, guys.

6418
05:02:19,620 --> 05:02:20,160
Alright.

6419
05:02:20,380 --> 05:02:20,960
We can do this.

6420
05:02:22,960 --> 05:02:23,500
Okay.

6421
05:02:23,500 --> 05:02:26,660
Okay, we can... we can do this.

6422
05:02:27,560 --> 05:02:29,880
Okay, we can totally do this.

6423
05:02:31,520 --> 05:02:32,840
Okay, here we go.

6424
05:02:33,900 --> 05:02:35,760
God damn it, we can do this!

6425
05:02:36,680 --> 05:02:38,100
Alright, get over here!

6426
05:02:38,220 --> 05:02:38,440
Gun!

6427
05:02:39,540 --> 05:02:40,080
Gun!

6428
05:02:41,880 --> 05:02:42,580
There we go.

6429
05:02:43,100 --> 05:02:43,780
It's fine.

6430
05:02:44,760 --> 05:02:45,400
It's fine.

6431
05:02:45,900 --> 05:02:47,400
I told you we could do this!

6432
05:02:48,320 --> 05:02:49,340
I told you!

6433
05:02:53,500 --> 05:02:54,020
Come on.

6434
05:02:54,340 --> 05:02:54,740
Dodge!

6435
05:02:56,720 --> 05:02:57,880
There, he can't get another gun!

6436
05:02:59,500 --> 05:03:00,360
I told you!

6437
05:03:01,180 --> 05:03:02,260
Ah, he shanked me!

6438
05:03:02,460 --> 05:03:03,800
Alright, this is not good though.

6439
05:03:04,040 --> 05:03:05,120
The shank is not good.

6440
05:03:07,720 --> 05:03:08,360
Okay, nice.

6441
05:03:09,880 --> 05:03:12,180
I messed up the combo for that, but that's okay.

6442
05:03:13,540 --> 05:03:14,140
That's alright.

6443
05:03:14,240 --> 05:03:15,220
And I dodged.

6444
05:03:15,240 --> 05:03:16,900
It's okay, I still have plenty of HP.

6445
05:03:17,540 --> 05:03:17,940
Nope!

6446
05:03:18,140 --> 05:03:20,400
No shanking, no shanking, no shank... Oh shit!

6447
05:03:21,100 --> 05:03:21,720
No gun.

6448
05:03:24,760 --> 05:03:25,840
Yeah, I think he's okay.

6449
05:03:26,940 --> 05:03:27,620
Don't worry.

6450
05:03:28,520 --> 05:03:29,560
I think he'll be okay.

6451
05:03:30,740 --> 05:03:32,000
See, I told you!

6452
05:03:32,540 --> 05:03:33,600
I got this!

6453
05:03:34,500 --> 05:03:34,980
Nope.

6454
05:03:35,360 --> 05:03:36,080
No gun.

6455
05:03:38,520 --> 05:03:39,440
There we go.

6456
05:03:39,640 --> 05:03:40,080
Watch.

6457
05:03:41,440 --> 05:03:41,920
Easy.

6458
05:03:44,960 --> 05:03:45,880
First try.

6459
05:03:49,300 --> 05:03:49,780
Nice.

6460
05:03:49,960 --> 05:03:50,680
We did it!

6461
05:03:52,860 --> 05:03:53,340
Alright.

6462
05:03:53,500 --> 05:03:55,360
And then... is it hacking time?

6463
05:03:56,560 --> 05:03:57,380
Hacking time.

6464
05:04:01,590 --> 05:04:03,210
Time to play on my phone.

6465
05:04:03,610 --> 05:04:05,290
Time to play on my PSP.

6466
05:04:06,470 --> 05:04:07,030
Oh.

6467
05:04:08,310 --> 05:04:08,870
PSP?

6468
05:04:10,030 --> 05:04:10,590
PSP?

6469
05:04:11,450 --> 05:04:13,590
This is why PSP was discontinued.

6470
05:04:13,950 --> 05:04:15,910
Surely they have healthcare in Gotham.

6471
05:04:15,990 --> 05:04:16,670

Another hacker man.

6476
05:04:25,830 --> 05:04:26,510
Hacker man time.

6482
05:04:46,810 --> 05:04:48,050

Oh wait, I can upgrade.

6488
05:04:54,510 --> 05:04:55,350
Alright, what to upgrade?

6489
05:04:55,570 --> 05:04:56,090
Oh, I'm like...

6490
05:04:56,090 --> 05:05:01,030
I think I'm gonna upgrade... Uh... Triple Batarangs!

05:05:04,310 --> 05:05:09,750
I think that's pretty good knowing whoידs.

6493
05:05:10,350 --> 05:05:10,950

6494
05:05:19,390 --> 05:05:19,910

6498
05:05:27,690 --> 05:05:27,710
Save this so we can play it again.

6499
05:05:27,710 --> 05:05:27,790
And then...

6500
05:05:27,790 --> 05:05:28,210
Help us, quickly.

6501
05:05:28,210 --> 05:05:28,490
There is a doughnut.

6502
05:05:28,830 --> 05:05:30,470
There is a doughnut at the base.

6503
05:05:30,870 --> 05:05:33,050

05:05:39,630 --> 05:05:42,390
I've been like bumping into like a lot of fucking...

6512
05:05:43,190 --> 05:05:46,670
Like not fan interactions, but like a lot of random interactions.

6513
05:05:46,890 --> 05:05:47,550
It's been funny.

6514
05:05:48,730 --> 05:05:52,190
The amount of random interactions I've been getting in voice.

6515
05:05:57,160 --> 05:05:58,040
Niko Myoshi.

6516
05:05:58,320 --> 05:05:59,880
Niko's not even single!

6517
05:06:04,420 --> 05:06:05,540
Oh wait, there's something over there.

6518
05:06:09,080 --> 05:06:09,740

6520
05:06:34,240 --> 05:06:36,980
I can love him from afar!

6521
05:06:48,780 --> 05:06:53,400

6522
05:06:56,900 --> 05:06:57,840

6523
05:06:58,100 --> 05:06:59,700

6526
05:07:09,500 --> 05:07:11,820
He's just a bro-doki!

6527
05:07:14,600 --> 05:07:16,480
Yay, teeth!

6528
05:07:25,370 --> 05:07:27,810

A bro-sheet!

6532
05:07:35,290 --> 05:07:35,990
What?

6533
05:07:36,090 --> 05:07:36,730
What are you sending?

6534
05:07:42,950 --> 05:07:43,950
Where is it?

6535
05:07:44,690 --> 05:07:45,930
Where is the Joker?

6536
05:07:47,570 --> 05:07:48,870
Is it in here?

6537
05:07:52,440 --> 05:07:53,820
Oh, damn it!

6538
05:07:54,340 --> 05:07:55,860

Oh, nice.

6545
05:08:10,260 --> 05:08:11,200

6546
05:08:13,240 --> 05:08:13,800

6559
05:08:23,500 --> 05:08:24,360

6615
05:10:12,160 --> 05:10:12,680

6625
05:10:28,250 --> 05:10:29,170
It's not fair.

6626
05:10:29,770 --> 05:10:30,770
That's not fair!

6627
05:10:30,930 --> 05:10:31,490

Yes!

6642
05:10:56,170 --> 05:10:56,450
Okay.

6643
05:10:56,950 --> 05:10:58,310
Just keep hurting each other.

6644
05:10:58,370 --> 05:10:58,710
Okay.

6645
05:10:59,070 --> 05:10:59,150
Okay.

6646
05:10:59,150 --> 05:11:00,470
Let's finish this.

6647
05:11:00,630 --> 05:11:00,790
Woo!

6648
05:11:02,790 --> 05:11:03,230
Woo!

6649
05:11:03,970 --> 05:11:04,410
Okay.

6650
05:11:05,030 --> 05:11:06,050
No, keep charging!

6651
05:11:06,130 --> 05:11:06,630
Keep charging!

6652
05:11:06,650 --> 05:11:07,450
It's just there!

6653
05:11:08,790 --> 05:11:09,710
No, no, no!

6654
05:11:09,770 --> 05:11:10,710
Don't use your bodies!

6655
05:11:10,790 --> 05:11:11,910
Do not use the bodies!

6656
05:11:13,410 --> 05:11:13,990
Come on!

6657
05:11:14,010 --> 05:11:14,330
Bowling!

6658
05:11:14,390 --> 05:11:14,710
Bowling!

6659
05:11:14,710 --> 05:11:15,090
Bowling!

6660
05:11:15,090 --> 05:11:15,430
Bowling!

6661
05:11:15,430 --> 05:11:15,770
Bowling!

6662
05:11:15,770 --> 05:11:16,030
Bowling!

6663
05:11:16,070 --> 05:11:16,290
Bowling!

6664
05:11:16,290 --> 05:11:16,510
Yes!

6665
05:11:17,570 --> 05:11:18,010
Yes!

6666
05:11:18,010 --> 05:11:18,430
Bowling!

6667
05:11:19,250 --> 05:11:20,010
Oh god.

6668
05:11:20,610 --> 05:11:21,870
We can do this again.

6669
05:11:22,570 --> 05:11:23,810
We can do this again!

6670
05:11:24,150 --> 05:11:24,970
No, no, no!

6671
05:11:27,130 --> 05:11:28,010
Keep bowling!

6672
05:11:28,170 --> 05:11:28,590
Keep bowling!

6673
05:11:29,150 --> 05:11:30,750
The bowling will work eventually!

6674
05:11:31,470 --> 05:11:32,090
Woo!

6675
05:11:32,650 --> 05:11:34,410
Woo, woo, woo, woo!

6676
05:11:35,390 --> 05:11:36,230
Woo!

6677
05:11:39,910 --> 05:11:40,630
Woo!

6678
05:11:40,790 --> 05:11:41,210
Woo!

6679
05:11:44,710 --> 05:11:46,390
Human dodgeball!

6680
05:11:48,170 --> 05:11:50,230
It's human dodgeball time!

6681
05:11:51,850 --> 05:11:52,850
Come on!

6682
05:11:52,870 --> 05:11:53,230
Come on!

6683
05:11:53,450 --> 05:11:54,450
Come on!

6684
05:11:54,610 --> 05:11:55,390
Woo!

6685
05:11:55,950 --> 05:11:56,470
Okay.

6686
05:11:57,290 --> 05:11:58,130
Yes!

6687
05:11:58,370 --> 05:11:59,030
Yes!

6688
05:11:59,030 --> 05:11:59,130
Yes!

6689
05:12:04,570 --> 05:12:06,570
There's too many dodge balls!

6690
05:12:06,770 --> 05:12:08,690
There's too many bowling pins!

6691
05:12:09,190 --> 05:12:10,350
What do I do?

6692
05:12:11,110 --> 05:12:12,590
Oh, fuck you!

6693
05:12:12,850 --> 05:12:15,010
There's too many bowling pins!

6694
05:12:18,370 --> 05:12:19,870
Oh my god!

6695
05:12:20,430 --> 05:12:23,110
I can't expect it anymore!

6696
05:12:27,030 --> 05:12:28,450
Oh my god!

6697
05:12:28,630 --> 05:12:30,290
Oh please, eventually!

6698
05:12:33,010 --> 05:12:34,790
Okay, alright.

6699
05:12:35,390 --> 05:12:36,230
Technique!

6700
05:12:36,310 --> 05:12:37,690
Oh my god, eventually!

6701
05:12:38,730 --> 05:12:39,570
Eventually!

6702
05:12:40,510 --> 05:12:41,350
Whoa!

6703
05:12:45,770 --> 05:12:46,610
Okay.

6704
05:12:46,610 --> 05:12:49,030
Eventually there'll be less people, right?

6705
05:12:49,910 --> 05:12:50,750
They're counting!

6706
05:12:51,710 --> 05:12:52,930
They're counting!

6707
05:12:53,110 --> 05:12:54,230
Happy people forever!

6708
05:12:55,150 --> 05:12:56,650
There's no way!

6709
05:12:58,790 --> 05:13:00,130
Oh no!

6710
05:13:00,450 --> 05:13:01,250
Oh no!

6711
05:13:02,510 --> 05:13:03,310
Please!

6712
05:13:03,590 --> 05:13:06,030
Please, all this human dodge ball!

6713
05:13:07,070 --> 05:13:07,690
Wow!

6714
05:13:10,610 --> 05:13:13,950
They're infinite until you kill the giant?!

6715
05:13:13,950 --> 05:13:16,410
Okay, okay, this is unfortunate.

6716
05:13:16,810 --> 05:13:21,150
This is very unfortunate because this is very difficult.

6717
05:13:21,410 --> 05:13:21,630
No!

6718
05:13:21,830 --> 05:13:22,770
Oh my god!

6719
05:13:25,470 --> 05:13:27,330
Oh please!

6720
05:13:28,090 --> 05:13:31,050
This is so difficult to dodge!

6721
05:13:37,070 --> 05:13:39,070
I... I'm so sad.

6722
05:13:39,350 --> 05:13:40,790
We killed each other.

6723
05:13:41,270 --> 05:13:45,570
I'm so sad!

6724
05:13:46,010 --> 05:13:49,470
We killed each other but it didn't count!

6725
05:13:50,830 --> 05:13:52,650
Oh my god!

6726
05:13:53,090 --> 05:13:55,830
I can't believe it didn't count!

6727
05:13:56,410 --> 05:13:58,510
I can't believe it!

6728
05:13:58,590 --> 05:14:00,510
We were so close!

6729
05:14:00,830 --> 05:14:02,550
We were actually so close!

6730
05:14:03,570 --> 05:14:05,230
Oh my god!

6731
05:14:05,410 --> 05:14:06,890
What happened?!

6732
05:14:08,090 --> 05:14:10,230
I can't believe it!

6733
05:14:12,030 --> 05:14:13,710
Oh my god, wrong one!

6734
05:14:13,970 --> 05:14:16,950
I can't believe we were so close!

6735
05:14:20,710 --> 05:14:21,310
Oh my god!

6736
05:14:21,310 --> 05:14:21,310
No!

6737
05:14:21,310 --> 05:14:22,510
Not the f- No!

6738
05:14:25,110 --> 05:14:26,510
Oh my god!

6739
05:14:28,850 --> 05:14:30,010
Please let me on!

6740
05:14:30,250 --> 05:14:30,810
No!

6741
05:14:30,990 --> 05:14:31,690
Not you!

6742
05:14:31,870 --> 05:14:32,970
I don't care about you!

6743
05:14:33,770 --> 05:14:34,850
Oh my god!

6744
05:14:34,930 --> 05:14:35,550
Okay, there you go!

6745
05:14:36,090 --> 05:14:36,650
Alright.

6746
05:14:37,650 --> 05:14:38,430
No, no, no.

6747
05:14:38,490 --> 05:14:40,130
Head into the electricity!

6748
05:14:40,970 --> 05:14:42,550
Get into the electricity!

6749
05:14:43,630 --> 05:14:45,910
I don't care about the people!

6750
05:14:49,870 --> 05:14:50,430
Please!

6751
05:14:50,630 --> 05:14:51,190
Please!

6752
05:14:51,710 --> 05:14:54,750
If I don't kill them, it'd be easier!

6753
05:14:58,830 --> 05:15:00,390
Oh my god.

6754
05:15:00,450 --> 05:15:03,950
It'd be easier because there'd be less people to worry about!

6755
05:15:06,710 --> 05:15:07,930
Oh no, please.

6756
05:15:08,670 --> 05:15:10,370
Please, I beg of you.

6757
05:15:10,550 --> 05:15:12,090
Do not do this to me.

6758
05:15:15,390 --> 05:15:15,950
Okay.

6759
05:15:16,950 --> 05:15:17,810
I beg of you.

6760
05:15:18,150 --> 05:15:19,370
I beg of you.

6761
05:15:19,550 --> 05:15:20,090
Please!

6762
05:15:23,470 --> 05:15:24,010
Okay.

6763
05:15:25,770 --> 05:15:26,310
Please!

6764
05:15:26,450 --> 05:15:26,950
Dodge!

6765
05:15:27,610 --> 05:15:27,990
Oh!

6766
05:15:28,190 --> 05:15:29,130
Dodge, please!

6767
05:15:29,370 --> 05:15:30,070
Oh, thank god!

6768
05:15:30,130 --> 05:15:30,370
Okay.

6769
05:15:30,670 --> 05:15:32,030
Do not open the elevator!

6770
05:15:32,250 --> 05:15:33,750
Do not open the elevator!

6771
05:15:33,910 --> 05:15:34,810
There's still people alive!

6772
05:15:40,010 --> 05:15:40,550
Yes.

6773
05:15:40,550 --> 05:15:41,090
Yes.

6774
05:15:42,910 --> 05:15:43,450
Alright.

6775
05:15:44,070 --> 05:15:44,990
Oh no.

6776
05:15:44,990 --> 05:15:47,730
Oh no, they're gonna open the elevator!

6777
05:15:48,090 --> 05:15:48,250
No!

6778
05:15:48,450 --> 05:15:49,390
The elevator!

6779
05:15:51,610 --> 05:15:53,090
Not the elevator!

6780
05:15:55,750 --> 05:15:56,970
Oh no!

6781
05:15:58,190 --> 05:16:00,130
Not the fucking elevator!

6782
05:16:02,700 --> 05:16:03,250
It's okay.

6783
05:16:03,450 --> 05:16:04,390
It's okay.

6784
05:16:04,590 --> 05:16:05,990
Everything will be okay.

6785
05:16:06,830 --> 05:16:08,470
Everything will be okay!

6786
05:16:09,730 --> 05:16:10,470
Please.

6787
05:16:11,210 --> 05:16:11,950
Please.

6788
05:16:12,710 --> 05:16:14,950
Oh no, not the fucking dodgeball.

6789
05:16:18,110 --> 05:16:18,710
Okay.

6790
05:16:19,090 --> 05:16:19,890
We're fine.

6791
05:16:19,990 --> 05:16:20,590
We're so fine.

6792
05:16:20,670 --> 05:16:21,370
We're so healthy.

6793
05:16:21,910 --> 05:16:23,630
We're so healthy right now.

6794
05:16:24,890 --> 05:16:25,490
No!

6795
05:16:25,510 --> 05:16:25,810
Okay!

6796
05:16:25,930 --> 05:16:27,370
I'm... It's a strategic take!

6797
05:16:27,670 --> 05:16:28,170
Ow!

6798
05:16:28,250 --> 05:16:29,490
It's a strategic take!

6799
05:16:31,110 --> 05:16:31,990
It's strategic!

6800
05:16:33,870 --> 05:16:35,310
Please don't open the elevator.

6801
05:16:35,550 --> 05:16:37,010
Please don't open the elevator.

6802
05:16:37,350 --> 05:16:38,730
Please, there's still people alive!

6803
05:16:39,190 --> 05:16:40,450
There's still people alive!

6804
05:16:40,450 --> 05:16:40,830
There's still people alive!

6805
05:16:41,450 --> 05:16:41,930
There's still people alive!

6806
05:16:41,930 --> 05:16:41,950
There's still people alive!

6807
05:16:44,700 --> 05:16:45,180
Okay.

6808
05:16:45,640 --> 05:16:46,120
Charge!

6809
05:16:46,240 --> 05:16:46,440
Charge!

6810
05:16:46,480 --> 05:16:46,700
Charge!

6811
05:16:46,720 --> 05:16:46,940
Charge!

6812
05:16:46,960 --> 05:16:47,080
Charge!

6813
05:16:47,300 --> 05:16:47,720
Woo!

6814
05:16:49,320 --> 05:16:49,800
What?!

6815
05:16:51,120 --> 05:16:51,600
Alright.

6816
05:16:51,740 --> 05:16:52,860
That was bullshit though.

6817
05:16:52,980 --> 05:16:54,880
That was actually bullshit.

6818
05:16:58,360 --> 05:17:00,420
Please let me... Let me on him!

6819
05:17:01,160 --> 05:17:02,580
Let me on him, you...

6820
05:17:05,060 --> 05:17:05,540
Please!

6821
05:17:07,300 --> 05:17:07,780
Okay.

6822
05:17:08,800 --> 05:17:09,880
Get away from me!

6823
05:17:10,000 --> 05:17:11,260
Get away from me!

6824
05:17:18,660 --> 05:17:19,360
Get away from me!

6825
05:17:19,360 --> 05:17:20,020
Oh, my God!

6826
05:17:20,400 --> 05:17:20,560
Oh, my God!

6827
05:17:20,560 --> 05:17:23,900
Get the fuck away from me!

6828
05:17:26,060 --> 05:17:26,760
Okay.

6829
05:17:27,020 --> 05:17:27,520
We're fine.

6830
05:17:27,580 --> 05:17:28,000
We're fine.

6831
05:17:29,020 --> 05:17:30,760
You guys lied to me!

6832
05:17:31,000 --> 05:17:33,140
You guys said they'll keep coming!

6833
05:17:33,500 --> 05:17:37,600
But there's clearly... They clearly keep coming no matter what!

6834
05:17:37,600 --> 05:17:37,820
What?

6835
05:17:39,820 --> 05:17:42,180
I can't believe I got one guide again.

6836
05:17:42,580 --> 05:17:44,080
I can't believe it.

6837
05:17:44,300 --> 05:17:45,660
I got one guide.

6838
05:17:45,940 --> 05:17:49,400
I got one guide.

6839
05:17:51,160 --> 05:17:52,400
Oh my god.

6840
05:17:52,920 --> 05:17:54,680
I got one guide so hard.

6841
05:17:55,920 --> 05:17:59,320
They would always exist, but at least it's easier now.

6842
05:18:01,400 --> 05:18:04,180
At least it's so much easier now.

6843
05:18:04,860 --> 05:18:06,300
Oh my god.

6844
05:18:06,300 --> 05:18:08,460
Thank fucking god.

6845
05:18:10,180 --> 05:18:10,780
Dodge.

6846
05:18:11,400 --> 05:18:12,520
We're so close.

6847
05:18:13,600 --> 05:18:14,640
Get out of here.

6848
05:18:15,120 --> 05:18:16,560
Get the fuck out of here.

6849
05:18:18,060 --> 05:18:19,020
Leave me alone.

6850
05:18:19,800 --> 05:18:21,660
Leave me the fuck alone.

6851
05:18:23,200 --> 05:18:23,800
Nice.

6852
05:18:25,480 --> 05:18:26,080
Boom!

6853
05:18:29,220 --> 05:18:30,200
There you go.

6854
05:18:30,280 --> 05:18:30,900
We did it.

6855
05:18:31,800 --> 05:18:33,640
Oh, we fucking did it.

6856
05:18:33,680 --> 05:18:36,080
Please, where's my HP?

6857
05:18:36,300 --> 05:18:36,720
Recharge.

6858
05:18:37,400 --> 05:18:39,240
Why isn't my HP recharged?

6859
05:18:39,340 --> 05:18:39,860
Oh, thank god.

6860
05:18:39,920 --> 05:18:41,040
Okay, my HP recharged.

6861
05:18:41,400 --> 05:18:42,440
Oh, thank god.

6862
05:18:42,740 --> 05:18:43,780
Oh, thank god.

6863
05:18:44,700 --> 05:18:45,760
We go this way.

6864
05:18:47,180 --> 05:18:47,620
Okay.

6865
05:18:49,740 --> 05:18:50,900
Alright, we do this.

6866
05:18:51,880 --> 05:18:52,680
Get down.

6867
05:18:54,440 --> 05:18:55,720
Archie, thank you for the super chat.

6868
05:18:55,800 --> 05:18:58,740
Thank you, thank you, thank you for making me laugh so much on my birthday.

6869
05:18:58,880 --> 05:18:59,640
Happy birthday!

6870
05:19:00,220 --> 05:19:01,780
I'm glad you've been having a great time.

6871
05:19:02,440 --> 05:19:04,140
Oh, happy birthday to you.

6872
05:19:04,420 --> 05:19:05,940
Happy birthday to you.

6873
05:19:06,300 --> 05:19:07,720
Happy birthday, dear Archie.

6874
05:19:07,980 --> 05:19:09,480
Happy birthday to you.

6875
05:19:09,600 --> 05:19:09,840
Yeah!

6876
05:19:10,820 --> 05:19:11,620
Alright, where am I?

6877
05:19:12,720 --> 05:19:13,480
Okay, above.

6878
05:19:17,140 --> 05:19:17,760
Here we go.

6879
05:19:20,040 --> 05:19:21,580
Games, thank you for the super chat.

6880
05:19:21,660 --> 05:19:22,520
Thank you, thank you.

6881
05:19:22,660 --> 05:19:23,920
They're gonna try and hit you.

6882
05:19:24,060 --> 05:19:25,560
My advice is you don't...

6883
05:19:25,560 --> 05:19:26,220
I...

6884
05:19:36,350 --> 05:19:37,390
Okay, give me...

6885
05:19:37,390 --> 05:19:38,110
Okay, give me...

6886
05:19:42,330 --> 05:19:43,550
Don't worry, we're...

6887
05:19:43,550 --> 05:19:44,830
We're gonna be back soon.

6888
05:19:44,830 --> 05:19:47,610
We're gonna be back soon.

6889
05:19:50,210 --> 05:19:51,670
Oh my god.

6890
05:19:52,250 --> 05:19:54,850
Wifi, why are you like this?

6891
05:19:55,510 --> 05:19:56,270
Wifi.

6892
05:19:56,890 --> 05:19:58,890
Why are you like this?

6893
05:19:58,990 --> 05:19:59,590
Wifi.

6894
05:20:04,450 --> 05:20:04,830
Please.

6895
05:20:06,790 --> 05:20:08,230
Please, what have I done?

6896
05:20:08,310 --> 05:20:08,710
Please, what have I done?

6897
05:20:08,710 --> 05:20:09,110
I'm gonna use you.

6898
05:20:09,110 --> 05:20:11,150
Other than never use you.

6899
05:20:11,410 --> 05:20:12,030
Wifi.

6900
05:20:13,730 --> 05:20:14,350
Why?

6901
05:20:17,450 --> 05:20:18,630
Alright, here we go.

6902
05:20:18,750 --> 05:20:19,910
We're back in it.

6903
05:20:20,030 --> 05:20:22,170
There's apparently a scan downstairs anyway.

6904
05:20:22,980 --> 05:20:23,590
There is?

6905
05:20:23,910 --> 05:20:24,850
Like here?

6906
05:20:28,020 --> 05:20:29,360
Where's the scan at?

6907
05:20:29,440 --> 05:20:29,580
Ow.

6908
05:20:30,960 --> 05:20:32,280
Where's the scan at?

6909
05:20:35,250 --> 05:20:35,980
Where do I scan?

6910
05:20:37,400 --> 05:20:38,020
Liars!

6911
05:20:40,240 --> 05:20:41,480
This scuff is so strong.

6912
05:20:41,520 --> 05:20:41,840
Oh, here!

6913
05:20:42,880 --> 05:20:43,800
It's like right here.

6914
05:21:01,760 --> 05:21:02,880
Gladstone, thank you for the super chat.

6915
05:21:03,000 --> 05:21:03,420
Thank you, thank you.

6916
05:21:03,420 --> 05:21:06,420
You've got actually several hours of the game left by the way.

6917
05:21:06,480 --> 05:21:08,920
So it's okay to stop here if need be.

6918
05:21:09,220 --> 05:21:09,980
Is he lying?

6919
05:21:10,080 --> 05:21:11,600
Thank you for the super chat.

6920
05:21:11,700 --> 05:21:12,440
Thank you, thank you.

6921
05:21:12,560 --> 05:21:15,160
Is he lying or is he speaking the truth?

6922
05:21:15,580 --> 05:21:17,420
How much more do I have?

6923
05:21:18,120 --> 05:21:19,300
I need to know.

6924
05:21:21,240 --> 05:21:22,700
How much more?

6925
05:21:28,970 --> 05:21:29,990
He's lying.

6926
05:21:30,490 --> 05:21:31,010
Okay.

6927
05:21:31,510 --> 05:21:34,150
Okay, now I don't know if you guys are lying now.

6928
05:21:35,530 --> 05:21:36,290
Ah, fuck.

6929
05:21:36,350 --> 05:21:36,610
Okay.

6930
05:21:38,470 --> 05:21:40,610
I still have two boss battles left?

6931
05:21:40,870 --> 05:21:41,130
One?

6932
05:21:41,130 --> 05:21:42,270
At least two?

6933
05:21:44,770 --> 05:21:46,130
Like 1.5?

6934
05:21:46,770 --> 05:21:47,550
Three hours?

6935
05:21:47,850 --> 05:21:48,870
I can do that.

6936
05:21:49,490 --> 05:21:50,490
That's fucking easy.

6937
05:21:51,390 --> 05:21:52,990
Okay, I need to figure out how to do this though.

6938
05:21:53,610 --> 05:21:55,030
How the fuck do I do this?

6939
05:21:58,170 --> 05:21:58,950
Oh, wait.

6940
05:21:59,450 --> 05:22:00,430
I tag it.

6941
05:22:00,890 --> 05:22:01,570
I forgot.

6942
05:22:01,630 --> 05:22:03,590
I have the tag.

6943
05:22:04,510 --> 05:22:04,950
Oop.

6944
05:22:08,230 --> 05:22:09,010
This is fine.

6945
05:22:11,230 --> 05:22:12,710
Okay, I'm gonna tag myself too.

6946
05:22:12,710 --> 05:22:14,050
I forgot how to...

6947
05:22:14,610 --> 05:22:14,910
Alright.

6948
05:22:15,030 --> 05:22:15,530
Boom.

6949
05:22:26,490 --> 05:22:28,310
How many crashes in those...

6950
05:22:28,310 --> 05:22:29,050
Don't say that.

6951
05:22:29,650 --> 05:22:30,250
Please.

6952
05:22:30,330 --> 05:22:30,890
Don't...

6953
05:22:37,010 --> 05:22:38,350
Don't say that.

6954
05:22:38,730 --> 05:22:40,070
What do you mean?

6955
05:22:40,230 --> 05:22:41,650
How many crashes?

6956
05:22:41,670 --> 05:22:42,470
So dead.

6957
05:22:44,430 --> 05:22:45,030
Nooooo.

6958
05:22:46,390 --> 05:22:46,990
Alright.

6959
05:22:47,550 --> 05:22:48,150
Alright.

6960
05:22:48,290 --> 05:22:51,090
We'll get out of this area and we'll do the last part.

6961
05:22:51,090 --> 05:22:55,210
We'll do the last part another time.

6962
05:22:56,730 --> 05:22:58,070
We need to get outside.

6963
05:22:58,430 --> 05:23:00,110
Okay, we'll get outside and then...

6964
05:23:00,110 --> 05:23:01,690
And then we'll call it here.

6965
05:23:06,280 --> 05:23:06,760
Alright.

6966
05:23:10,620 --> 05:23:11,660
Now we're outside.

6967
05:23:11,920 --> 05:23:12,600
Wait, is that...

6968
05:23:12,600 --> 05:23:13,400
Did I save?

6969
05:23:13,560 --> 05:23:13,920
Okay.

6970
05:23:15,300 --> 05:23:18,500
We'll go to the next area and then we'll call it here.

6971
05:23:18,820 --> 05:23:20,360
We'll go to the next area.

6972
05:23:20,800 --> 05:23:22,160
You'll be walking into a trap.

6973
05:23:22,420 --> 05:23:23,640
That's what she thinks.

6974
05:23:25,900 --> 05:23:26,500
Oh, wait.

6975
05:23:26,520 --> 05:23:27,740
Actually, we can do this.

6976
05:23:28,500 --> 05:23:29,740
Let's go to the...

6977
05:23:31,080 --> 05:23:33,560
Let's go to the Easter egg first.

6978
05:23:36,780 --> 05:23:37,300
Pissed.

6979
05:23:39,260 --> 05:23:41,580
This island belongs to me now.

6980
05:23:43,300 --> 05:23:44,260
Oh, is that Ivy?

6981
05:23:45,520 --> 05:23:47,200
Someone says, literally an hour.

6982
05:23:47,360 --> 05:23:48,060
I don't...

6983
05:23:48,060 --> 05:23:48,960
I don't...

6984
05:23:51,440 --> 05:23:52,260
Oh, shit.

6985
05:23:52,280 --> 05:23:53,560
There's four of you guys?

6986
05:23:53,600 --> 05:23:53,780
Oh, shit.

6987
05:23:53,780 --> 05:23:53,780
There's four of you guys?

6988
05:23:55,060 --> 05:23:56,840
You know, I think that's a good time to call it.

6989
05:24:02,860 --> 05:24:03,580
It's alright.

6990
05:24:03,680 --> 05:24:05,720
The game decided this is where I'm ending.

6991
05:24:05,980 --> 05:24:06,680
It's okay.

6992
05:24:06,860 --> 05:24:07,440
The game...

6993
05:24:13,480 --> 05:24:15,300
We let the game decide.

6994
05:24:16,160 --> 05:24:17,080
We let...

6995
05:24:17,080 --> 05:24:18,400
It's okay, guys.

6996
05:24:18,520 --> 05:24:21,380
We just let the game decide to call me here.

6997
05:24:21,900 --> 05:24:24,720
The game said the stream is over.

6998
05:24:27,980 --> 05:24:29,300
Oh, my God.

6999
05:24:29,640 --> 05:24:31,560
Thank you for the super chat.

7000
05:24:31,680 --> 05:24:32,260
Thank you.

7001
05:24:32,440 --> 05:24:32,940
Thank you.

7002
05:24:33,160 --> 05:24:35,840
It was like, no, we're done, Doki.

7003
05:24:36,000 --> 05:24:36,420
We are.

7004
05:24:36,440 --> 05:24:37,340
We are done here.

7005
05:24:37,680 --> 05:24:39,980
We're super fucking done here.

7006
05:24:41,120 --> 05:24:43,680
There's no, there's no last one.

7007
05:24:49,540 --> 05:24:50,800
Oh, my God.

7008
05:24:50,980 --> 05:24:52,440
What a wild ride.

7009
05:24:52,800 --> 05:24:53,840
I read a lot of super chats.

7010
05:24:56,260 --> 05:24:59,300
I'm not sure what happened to my cable.

7011
05:25:02,320 --> 05:25:05,640
I'm only on wifi right now for some fucking reason.

7012
05:25:06,060 --> 05:25:09,840
Even the game was like, no no no Doki, this is it.

7013
05:25:10,000 --> 05:25:11,840
I really wanted to finish it today too.

7014
05:25:11,900 --> 05:25:13,600
I knew I could finish it today.

7015
05:25:13,720 --> 05:25:15,280
But we were crashing way too.

7016
05:25:17,900 --> 05:25:20,220
It was not a good time.

7017
05:25:20,340 --> 05:25:22,140
The game was like, no no no.

7018
05:25:22,140 --> 05:25:26,320
And also the fact that I'm on wifi, I feel like we just had to stop.

7019
05:25:31,760 --> 05:25:33,100
But yeah, I had a great time.

7020
05:25:33,240 --> 05:25:39,720
I hope you guys had a great time watching today and hanging out with me.

7021
05:25:39,940 --> 05:25:41,380
It was definitely a really fun time.

7022
05:25:41,540 --> 05:25:44,240
Next week, I believe there's two collabs next week.

7023
05:25:44,720 --> 05:25:49,980
We're going to be playing Helldivers 2 again, but this time with a group.

7024
05:25:49,980 --> 05:25:52,720
Look forward to who it is.

7025
05:25:53,620 --> 05:25:59,220
But yes, it's going to be a full party for next week's Helldivers 2.

7026
05:25:59,440 --> 05:26:05,560
And then we're also going to... Lily and I are still planning a collab for next week.

7027
05:26:05,600 --> 05:26:06,860
We're still deciding what to do.

7028
05:26:07,400 --> 05:26:09,940
So I'm going to figure that out as well later.

7029
05:26:10,460 --> 05:26:12,940
Tomorrow is Sunday and I usually don't stream on Sunday.

7030
05:26:13,140 --> 05:26:15,500
So tomorrow is a break day for me.

7031
05:26:15,620 --> 05:26:17,240
Also, next Saturday!

7032
05:26:17,240 --> 05:26:20,220
On March... not March...

7033
05:26:20,220 --> 05:26:24,240
March 2nd will be our stream auction slash charity!

7034
05:26:24,600 --> 05:26:29,500
I'm really, really excited because there's a lot of really amazing things being auctioned off.

7035
05:26:29,660 --> 05:26:31,860
A lot of these items are one of a kind.

7036
05:26:33,360 --> 05:26:39,340
They are one of a kind items such as... I can actually give you guys an example.

7037
05:26:39,680 --> 05:26:42,320
So like one of them is like a one of a kind figure.

7038
05:26:42,820 --> 05:26:44,660
That's like... that's like...

7039
05:26:45,980 --> 05:26:50,520
That's like printed and then sent off to Japan to have it painted and everything.

7040
05:26:51,140 --> 05:26:55,020
And they were actually sent me like some concept art of it.

7041
05:26:55,120 --> 05:26:59,040
So like this is like a one of a kind figure that's going to be auctioned off.

7042
05:26:59,620 --> 05:27:01,780
And I'm super duper excited too.

7043
05:27:01,840 --> 05:27:06,100

05:27:17,780 --> 05:27:20,920

05:27:39,600 --> 05:27:42,220
Like next week for real!

7059
05:27:43,980 --> 05:27:46,160
I legit would have been able to finish it today.

7060
05:27:46,320 --> 05:27:48,580
If everything that...

7061
05:27:48,580 --> 05:27:50,640
If everything that didn't...

7062
05:27:50,640 --> 05:27:53,180
If I didn't go through so many things that went wrong today.

7063
05:27:53,320 --> 05:27:54,920
I would have finished it today.

7064
05:27:55,120 --> 05:27:56,040
It was so close.

7065
05:27:56,120 --> 05:27:58,060
We were so close to finishing it today.

7066
05:28:01,060 --> 05:28:01,940
But anyway...

7067
05:28:01,940 --> 05:28:03,260
Thank you everybody for coming.

7068
05:28:03,320 --> 05:28:04,780
As always everyone stay hydrated.

7069
05:28:05,080 --> 05:28:05,640
Posture check.

7070
05:28:05,680 --> 05:28:07,280
Get up and around to get that blood flowing.

7071
05:28:07,420 --> 05:28:09,100
And if you stayed up for me, head to bed.

7072
05:28:09,220 --> 05:28:10,160
Because you deserve it.

7073
05:28:10,200 --> 05:28:11,340
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

7074
05:28:11,720 --> 05:28:12,360
